in my perfect world.</i></font>

dances the branches of the tree...</i></font>

00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:13,460
<font color=#FFFF00><i>... casting leopards spots of light
across the face of pond.</i></font>

00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:20,180
<font color=#FFFF00><i>The tree stands tall...
and.. grand and alone,</i></font>

5
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,410
<font color=#FFFF00><i>... shading the world beneath it.</i></font>

6
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,894
<font color=#FFFF00><i>There will come a day when I rest
against its spine...</i></font>

7
00:01:25,895 --> 00:01:29,571
<font color=#FFFF00><i>... and look out over a valley where
the sun warms, but never burns.</i></font>

00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,541
<font color=#FFFF00><i>I will watch leaves turn..</i></font>

00:01:33,954 --> 00:01:36,370
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Green, then amber,
then crimson.</i></font>

10
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,070
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Then no
leaves at all...</i></font>

11
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,750
<font color=#FFFF00><i>But the tree will not die.</i></font>

<font color=#FFFF00><i>For in this place,
winter never comes...</i></font>

13
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,740
<font color=#FFFF00><i>It is here,
in the cradle of all I hold dear,</i></font>

14
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,250
<font color=#FFFF00><i>... I guard every memory of

<font color=#FFFF00><i>... and take solace in the simple

<font color=#FFFF00><i>Subtitled by Clarity.</i></font>

20
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,290
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you see Wyman's sheep dogs near
the flock?</font>

21
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,780
<font color=#FFFF00>Nope.</font>

22
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,090
<font color=#FFFF00>Told me he had six dogs watching
over it.</font>

23
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,500
<font color=#FFFF00>No. I am not to tell you..</font>

24
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,730
<font color=#FFFF00>I got a call from Tribal Police,
chief was asking for you.</font>

25
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,470
<font color=#FFFF00>There was a mountain lion working through
the flocks east of Boulder Flats.</font>

26
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:21,030
<font color=#FFFF00>You'd think folks would realize this
isn't sheep country.</font>

27
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,600
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, tore up a horse and some weanlings
too.</font>

28
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,260
<font color=#FFFF00>That sounds like wolves.</font>

29
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,630
<font color=#FFFF00>Chief says it's a cat, and they
ain't had no luck getting it.</font>

30
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,301
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll give him a call.</font>

31
00:04:30,302 --> 00:04:32,482
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah. Drop those off at Fish and Game.</font>

32
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,480
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

33
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,670
<font color=#FFFF00>- You got blood on your shirt..
- Just getting for work..</font>

34
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,230
<font color=#FFFF00>Who was the victim today?</font>

35
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,300
<font color=#FFFF00>Looks like it's gonna be me.</font>

36
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,920
<font color=#FFFF00>Want some coffee?</font>

37
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,260
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure...
Great.</font>

38
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,010
<font color=#FFFF00>So, I gotta go to the Rez tomorrow,.</font>

39
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,060
<font color=#FFFF00>thought I'd take Casey by
to see your folks..</font>

40
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,821
<font color=#FFFF00>Something killed a yearling in the pasture
behind their house.</font>

41
00:06:00,822 --> 00:06:03,252
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah... That's why I'm going.</font>

42
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,340
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't let Casey out of your sight
on the Rez, okay?</font>

43
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,020
<font color=#FFFF00>Like I said, I'm gonna leave him
with your folks while I scout.</font>

44
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,730
<font color=#FFFF00>- You know what I mean.
- Yeah, I do. I won't.</font>

45
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,080
<font color=#FFFF00>- Case.

pointing at right now?</font>

49
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,630
<font color=#FFFF00>- Come here, come down here.
- Sorry, Dad.</font>

50
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:35,980
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, where's the rule bud?</font>

51

59
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,270
<font color=#FFFF00>- No, no. Let him, let him.
- Yeah. I know.</font>

60
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,214
<font color=#FFFF00>He's still learning to
do things for himself.</font>

61
00:07:10,294 --> 00:07:11,445
<font color=#FFFF00>I agreed, but I've stood here..</font>

62
00:07:11,592 --> 00:07:13,032

<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, you can drag me through
Pinedale with a rope.</font>

00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,140
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, good luck.</font>

87
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,730
<font color=#FFFF00>When you do that,
he would be standing on your ground.</font>

88
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,070
<font color=#FFFF00>Who's got the height advantage now?</font>

89
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,030
<font color=#FFFF00>Who's got the height advantage?
Just back him up.</font>

00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,480
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to move her
until they have a look.</font>

145
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,910
<font color=#FFFF00>but I'm not gonna try to pull
her out after dark.</font>

146
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,070
<font color=#FFFF00>We gotta get
this show on the road.</font>

147
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,760
<font color=#FFFF00>We're losing the tracks.. Ben.</font>

148
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Now, it is coming down pretty good.</font>

149
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,060
<font color=#FFFF00>Should let me follow 'em while I
still can.</font>

150
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:15,360
<font color=#FFFF00>Can't let you do that.
Until it's all cleaned by the FBI.</font>

151
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,120
<font color=#FFFF00>Called her folks yet?</font>

152
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,340
<font color=#FFFF00>No, I want to take the body to Lander.</font>

153
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,430
<font color=#FFFF00>I know, it looks like Natalie, but...</font>

154
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,510
<font color=#FFFF00>It's Natalie.</font>

155
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,180
<font color=#FFFF00>There's your Feds.</font>

156
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,670
<font color=#FFFF00>What are these fools doing?</font>

157
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:46,550
<font color=#FFFF00>- Can't see the road..
- We don't have time for this.</font>

158
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,130
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll get 'em.</font>

159
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,640
<font color=#FFFF00>- Your destination is on the left.
- Where?</font>

160
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,010
<font color=#FFFF00>Turn left.</font>

161
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,970
<font color=#FFFF00>Where do you want me to turn left?</font>

162
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,690
<font color=#FFFF00>FBI?</font>

163
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,386
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you Tribal Police?</font>

164
00:19:08,387 --> 00:19:10,224
<font color=#FFFF00>No, I am here to take you to him.</font>

165
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,370
<font color=#FFFF00>- Look very close. Just follow me, ok?
- Yeah.</font>

166
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,510
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm Jane Banner.</font>

167
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,270
<font color=#FFFF00>- You're by yourself?
- Yeah, it's just me.</font>

168
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,555
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm Ben Shoyo,
I'm the Indian Tribal police chief.</font>

169
00:19:57,755 --> 00:20:00,530
<font color=#FFFF00>He's Cory Lambert,
with Fish and Wildlife.</font>

170
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,470
<font color=#FFFF00>He's the one who found the body.</font>

171
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:06,170
<font color=#FFFF00>And this is his father-in-law,
Dan.</font>

172
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,140
<font color=#FFFF00>He don't do nothing.</font>

173
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,800
<font color=#FFFF00>We got the same job eh?</font>

174
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,050
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry to meet under these circumstances.</font>

175
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,500
<font color=#FFFF00>So. Do You wanna
show me the body?</font>

176
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:19,820
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't mean to be rude, but I'm
freezing my ass up here, so...</font>

177
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,430
<font color=#FFFF00>The quicker the better.</font>

178
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:25,100
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, that's gonna get a lot worse
if you go out there dressed like that.</font>

179
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,410
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm a big girl, thank you.</font>

180
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,790
<font color=#FFFF00>Body's 5 miles on a snowmobile.</font>

181
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,850
<font color=#FFFF00>You'd be dead by the time we
got there.</font>

182
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,730
<font color=#FFFF00>I got the call when
I was in the court in Riverton.</font>

183
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,850
<font color=#FFFF00>So this is.. this is what I've got.</font>

184
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,330
<font color=#FFFF00>You should have a winter-gear bag
in that truck.</font>

185
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,640
<font color=#FFFF00>No, it's not a government vehicle,
it's a rental, actually I'm from Vegas.</font>

186
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,090
<font color=#FFFF00>So I'm just the closest agent
to the scene...</font>

187
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,680
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't think I
can make it..?</font>

188
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:50,276
<font color=#FFFF00>- You're from Vegas?
- No, I'm not from Vegas,</font>

189
00:20:50,488 --> 00:20:52,872
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm stationed there.
I'm from Fort Lauderdale.</font>

190
00:20:53,072 --> 00:20:54,820
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry, if we're gonna keep
having this conversation...</font>

191
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,330
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's get you fixed up inside.
It's gonna be great - Thanks.</font>

192
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,810
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry excuse me. Thanks.</font>

193
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,260
<font color=#FFFF00>See what they send us?</font>

194
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:11,210
<font color=#FFFF00>Thermals can make underwear wedge
up your bottom,</font>

195
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,340
<font color=#FFFF00>but I guess yours
are already there.</font>

196
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,550
<font color=#FFFF00>Here, these should fit.
You're skinny.</font>

197
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,250
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

198
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,560
<font color=#FFFF00>- You got gloves?
- No.</font>

199
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,660
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. What were they thinking
sending you here?</font>

200
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,370
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

201
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,530
<font color=#FFFF00>You bring them back the minute you're done.</font>

202
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,810
<font color=#FFFF00>They ain't a gift.</font>

203
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:58,520
<font color=#FFFF00>- You hear me?
- Yes, of course.</font>

204
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:06,840
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

205
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,400
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm... bundled.</font>

206
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,880
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go.</font>

207
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,240
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.
Hey, buddy.</font>

208
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,290
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm gonna need a couple more hours,
for work.</font>

209
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:25,795
<font color=#FFFF00>A couple.
This is our day.</font>

210
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,462
<font color=#FFFF00>I promise.</font>

211
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,880
<font color=#FFFF00>- Okay?
- Okay.</font>

212
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:33,350
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hang with Grandpa.
- Sweeten up. Let's go.</font>

213
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,640
<font color=#FFFF00>God, there was blizzard
here 20 minutes ago.</font>

214
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:54,010
<font color=#FFFF00>Comes in waves. Could be sunny for an hour.
Then you're right back in hell again.</font>

215
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,018
<font color=#FFFF00>Storm will come back.</font>

216
00:23:55,019 --> 00:23:57,092
<font color=#FFFF00>- That's something to look forward to.
- Yeah.</font>

217
00:23:57,127 --> 00:23:58,390
<font color=#FFFF00>Over here.</font>

218
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,273
<font color=#FFFF00>- You Got a positive ID?
- Not positive, no.</font>

219
00:24:05,535 --> 00:24:06,918
<font color=#FFFF00>Natalie Hanson.</font>

220
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,660
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll call that positive for now.</font>

221
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,920
<font color=#FFFF00>Does she lives close by?</font>

222
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,250
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, Fort Wakashie.</font>

223
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,740
<font color=#FFFF00>- North a ways.
- What's a ways'?</font>

224
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,120
<font color=#FFFF00>About a 30 minutes drive.</font>

225
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:27,600
<font color=#FFFF00>Ok, well, she didn't run from home then.</font>

226
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,510
<font color=#FFFF00>She's frozen solid.</font>

227
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:37,470
<font color=#FFFF00>No one reported her missing?
Her parents?</font>

228
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,900
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

229
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:46,900
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, that's why we called you.</font>

230
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:50,180
<font color=#FFFF00>How experienced is your medical examiner?</font>

231
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,830
<font color=#FFFF00>Just to say... He stays busy.</font>

232
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,390
<font color=#FFFF00>Order a rape kit,</font>

233
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:59,810
<font color=#FFFF00>When he's done with his prelim,
I want her body sent to Lovelind.</font>

234
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:02,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Make sure her belongings
go with her... they need to get tested too.</font>

235
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,360
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm listing this as a homicide.</font>

236
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:14,290
<font color=#FFFF00>How well do you know this land?</font>

237
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:17,440
<font color=#FFFF00>Like it's my job. Which it is.</font>

238
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:21,420
<font color=#FFFF00>Well is there anywhere she could be
running from? Is there anything close by?</font>

239
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:25,430
<font color=#FFFF00>Nearest houses..
3.5 miles from here southeast.</font>

240
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:29,100
<font color=#FFFF00>- Sam Little feathers place is over there..
- Yep.</font>

241
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,350
<font color=#FFFF00>Those boys could use some
serious looking into.</font>

242
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,630
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no structures closer?</font>

243
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,210
<font color=#FFFF00>There are drill rigs five miles from here..</font>

244
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,700
<font color=#FFFF00>They got trailers for the workers., but...</font>

245
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,060
<font color=#FFFF00>That's closed for the winter.</font>

246
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,990
<font color=#FFFF00>So why would a teenage girl be out here?</font>

247
00:25:45,695 --> 00:25:48,681
<font color=#FFFF00>Well kids come out here on their
snow machines.</font>

248
00:25:49,069 --> 00:25:51,117
<font color=#FFFF00>And have a big party in the snow.</font>

249
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:53,750
<font color=#FFFF00>Not barefoot.. they don't.</font>

250
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,850
<font color=#FFFF00>- What do you think?
- I know what the tracks say.</font>

251
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,800
<font color=#FFFF00>- Okay, That's all we got.
- Come here, I'll show you.</font>

252
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:12,550
<font color=#FFFF00>Come right here. See this one..
See how the toes turned out?</font>

253
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:14,388
<font color=#FFFF00>..the front is much deeper than the back.</font>

254
00:26:14,588 --> 00:26:17,490
<font color=#FFFF00>That says she was running.
Come here, let me show you.</font>

255
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,280
<font color=#FFFF00>She ran until she dropped.. here.</font>

256
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:25,380
<font color=#FFFF00>See the pool of blood
where her face hit the snow.?</font>

257
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,530
<font color=#FFFF00>Now it gets twenty below here
at night.</font>

258
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,953
<font color=#FFFF00>So if you fill your lungs up
with that cold air.</font>

259
00:26:31,258 --> 00:26:33,946
<font color=#FFFF00>when you're running..
it could freeze em up.</font>

260
00:26:34,222 --> 00:26:37,578
<font color=#FFFF00>Your lungs fill up with blood,
you start coughing it up</font>

261
00:26:37,678 --> 00:26:43,982
<font color=#FFFF00>So.. wherever she came from,
she ran all the way here.</font>

262
00:26:45,035 --> 00:26:46,657
<font color=#FFFF00>Her lungs burst here.</font>

263
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:50,970
<font color=#FFFF00>She curled up in that tree line
drowned up in her own blood.</font>

264
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,670
<font color=#FFFF00>How far do you think someone
can run barefoot out here?</font>

265
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,840
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh.. I don't know.</font>

266
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,420
<font color=#FFFF00>How to gauge someone's will to live...</font>

267
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,010
<font color=#FFFF00>... especially in these conditions?</font>

268
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,980
<font color=#FFFF00>But I knew that girl.</font>

269
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,060
<font color=#FFFF00>She was a fighter.</font>

270
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,748
<font color=#FFFF00>So no matter how far you think she ran...</font>

271
00:27:18,023 --> 00:27:20,251
<font color=#FFFF00>... I can guarantee you she ran farther.</font>

272
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,200
<font color=#FFFF00>I got to get back to my son.</font>

273
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:33,020
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, um.. Would you be willing to help me?</font>

274
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:35,970
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't.. I couldn't find the way
back to my car if I drive.</font>

275
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:38,740
<font color=#FFFF00>I really don't know how
to investigate this in...</font>

276
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.. Can I borrow him for a few days?</font>

277
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,060
<font color=#FFFF00>What? He doesn't work for me.</font>

278
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,695
<font color=#FFFF00>You got a lion to kill, don't forget.</font>

279
00:27:48,696 --> 00:27:50,491
<font color=#FFFF00>There's three o 'em. And I didn't.</font>

280
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:53,780
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry.. what is it..
what is it that you to again?</font>

281
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:58,060
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hunter.
- You are a lion hunter?</font>

282
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,250
<font color=#FFFF00>I hunt predators.</font>

283
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,880
<font color=#FFFF00>Good. Why don't you
come hunt one for me then?</font>

284
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,450
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

285
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,850
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad?</font>

286
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:36,790
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, bud.
You happen to can't sleep?</font>

287
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,490
<font color=#FFFF00>I had a nightmare.</font>

288
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:42,650
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that right?
What is it about?</font>

289
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,740
<font color=#FFFF00>Who was she?</font>

290
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,210
<font color=#FFFF00>Come over here.</font>

291
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:58,160
<font color=#FFFF00>- Want some milk?
- No.</font>

292
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:07,310
<font color=#FFFF00>She's a girl
who's lost her way in the snow.. that's all.</font>

293
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,560
<font color=#FFFF00>What's all this?</font>

294
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,080
<font color=#FFFF00>That's work buddy.</font>

295
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,310
<font color=#FFFF00>Did she die like Emily?</font>

296
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,260
<font color=#FFFF00>She died in the cold.</font>

297
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:27,030
<font color=#FFFF00>So she died like Emily?</font>

298
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:33,370
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, so...
I'm afraid she did.</font>

299
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,330
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry.</font>

300
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,830
<font color=#FFFF00>- I see you found town okay.
- Yeah.. barely.</font>

301
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,022
<font color=#FFFF00>Do the family identified the body?</font>

302
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:52,708
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah.</font>

303
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:58,030
<font color=#FFFF00>Did they give you a reason for
not reporting her missing?</font>

304
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:01,730
<font color=#FFFF00>Well she stayed with a boyfriend some...
didn't think anything of it.</font>

305
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:04,490
<font color=#FFFF00>She was eighteen.
Free to do what she wanted.</font>

306
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,970
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you done this before?</font>

307
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:11,464
<font color=#FFFF00>- Observed an autopsy?
- Yeah?</font>

308
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,590
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah.. no.</font>

309
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,050
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyone who tells you it gets easy
is a goddamn liar.</font>

310
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,140
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's get
it over with.</font>

311
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,012
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay Randy, you're on the clock.</font>

312
00:30:24,212 --> 00:30:26,451
<font color=#FFFF00>I've got about five minutes of this with me,
so let's go.</font>

313
00:30:26,671 --> 00:30:27,899
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be quick</font>

314
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:31,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Good morning, Randy Whitehurst,
the medical examiner.</font>

315
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,190
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm Agent Banner.
- She's FBI.</font>

316
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,730
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you, yes. I'm FBI.</font>

317
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:41,030
<font color=#FFFF00>- This your first autopsy?
- Yes.</font>

318
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,050
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, gotta have a first.</font>

319
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:48,710
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, it's my first on an investigation,
but... I am trained for this, so..</font>

320
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:53,500
<font color=#FFFF00>- if we can just get to this. Please.
- Yes, ma'am.</font>

321
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:58,330
<font color=#FFFF00>As you see here, she suffered a deep
laceration along her brow line.</font>

322
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,382
<font color=#FFFF00>Two separated ribs.</font>

323
00:31:00,383 --> 00:31:02,721
<font color=#FFFF00>Frost bite in
both feet up through her ankles.</font>

324
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:06,605
<font color=#FFFF00>Circumstances is your field, not mine.</font>

325
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:09,540
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let me show you.
- No I don't need it explained</font>

326
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,776
<font color=#FFFF00>I need to find whoever...</font>

327
00:31:10,976 --> 00:31:13,561
<font color=#FFFF00>... chased her to death in this
snow and put him in prison.</font>

328
00:31:13,761 --> 00:31:15,250
<font color=#FFFF00>and not calling it...</font>

329
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry.</font>

330
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:23,290
<font color=#FFFF00>This is very prosecutable
as a murder..</font>

331
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:24,917
<font color=#FFFF00>Clearly she wouldn't have been
running through the snow</font>

332
00:31:25,118 --> 00:31:25,957
<font color=#FFFF00>if she hadn't been attacked,</font>

333
00:31:26,057 --> 00:31:29,250
<font color=#FFFF00>but I can't list the cause
of death as a homicide.</font>

334
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,887
<font color=#FFFF00>And I can't get an FBI team
to the reservation...</font>

335
00:31:31,888 --> 00:31:33,970
<font color=#FFFF00>... unless it's listed as a homicide.</font>

336
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:35,921
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not here to solve this..</font>

337
00:31:35,922 --> 00:31:37,999
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm here to obtain a
cause of death...</font>

338
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,297
<font color=#FFFF00>... and send a team here that can.</font>

339
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:42,840
<font color=#FFFF00>Look, present the rape, present the
assault and I'm sure...</font>

340
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,560
<font color=#FFFF00>Those aren't under
the jurisdiction of the FBI.</font>

341
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,280
<font color=#FFFF00>Those fall to the Bureau of Indian Affairs.</font>

342
00:31:50,526 --> 00:31:51,516
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry.</font>

343
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:54,440
<font color=#FFFF00>You keep saying sorry,
but you keep doing it.</font>

344
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:59,050
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't look at me.
Hey, I'm used to no help.</font>

345
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,496
<font color=#FFFF00>You have six officers on your
entire force...</font>

346
00:32:02,497 --> 00:32:04,736
<font color=#FFFF00>... to cover an area
the size of Rhode Island.</font>

347
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,120
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes I know that.</font>

348
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:10,780
<font color=#FFFF00>No offense, but this will have to curl
up in your lap in order for you to solve it.</font>

349
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:13,760
<font color=#FFFF00>- I know that too.
- We all know it's a murder.</font>

350
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:17,300
<font color=#FFFF00>You can have a US attorney to sign off on it
I'm happy to corroborate that,</font>

351
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,260
<font color=#FFFF00>But I just can't put it
on the death certificate.</font>

352
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:22,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

353
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,240
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

354
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:41,330
<font color=#FFFF00>I appreciate your passion.
It's not the Fed's usual response.</font>

355
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,470
<font color=#FFFF00>But Randy is on our side</font>

356
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:48,889
<font color=#FFFF00>My supervisor sees this report,
he's gonna want me back in Vegas.</font>

357
00:32:49,387 --> 00:32:52,662
<font color=#FFFF00>Not that I'm much help or anything..</font>

358
00:32:53,293 --> 00:32:55,197
<font color=#FFFF00>... but I'm all you've got.</font>

359
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,530
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.. What's that
hunter's phone number?</font>

360
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,420
<font color=#FFFF00>Ya?</font>

361
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,054
<font color=#FFFF00>So you never met him.</font>

362
00:33:26,606 --> 00:33:27,619
<font color=#FFFF00>No</font>

363
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,070
<font color=#FFFF00>- And she never talked about him?
- Not to me.</font>

364
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:35,504
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would you let your daughter stay with a
guy that you've never met?</font>

365
00:33:35,505 --> 00:33:37,558
<font color=#FFFF00>whose name you don't even know.?</font>

366
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,220
<font color=#FFFF00>Cause I look around, I see your photos...</font>

367
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,180
<font color=#FFFF00>- She was an adult..
- Barely.</font>

368
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,661
<font color=#FFFF00>Wyuksa psi wasichu.</font>

369
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,230
<font color=#FFFF00>- What does that mean?
- It ain't good.</font>

370
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,160
<font color=#FFFF00>Um.. look.</font>

371
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,170
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't mean to offend you.</font>

372
00:33:56,370 --> 00:34:01,270
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm trying to understand the dynamic here,
Mr. Hanson</font>

373
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,930
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm trying to help.</font>

374
00:34:02,931 --> 00:34:06,355
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is it whenever you people try
to help, it starts with insults.</font>

375
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,270
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know why she didn't tell me.</font>

376
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:14,000
<font color=#FFFF00>But she was eighteen.
And I chose to trust her..</font>

377
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:15,660
<font color=#FFFF00>I chose wrong.</font>

378
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:21,670
<font color=#FFFF00>Ok. Well.. um how about your wife,
did your daughter talk to her?</font>

379
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:25,380
<font color=#FFFF00>- Do you talk to your mother?
- Her name is Annie? Is she here?</font>

380
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,200
<font color=#FFFF00>- She's in the bedroom..
- I'd like to speak to her.</font>

381
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,920
<font color=#FFFF00>Be my guest.</font>

382
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:34,440
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.
Bedroom's just this way?</font>

383
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,090
<font color=#FFFF00>- Jane.
- yeah?</font>

384
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:41,959
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't mind, right?</font>

385
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,491
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, you don't need my permission.
You're an adult.</font>

386
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,000
<font color=#FFFF00>Barely..</font>

387
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:32,190
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm really sorry.</font>

388
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,630
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

389
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,930
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd like to tell you it gets
easier...</font>

390
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,790
<font color=#FFFF00>... doesn't.</font>

391
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:49,610
<font color=#FFFF00>If there's
any comfort...</font>

392
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:53,520
<font color=#FFFF00>...it's getting used to the pain I suppose.</font>

393
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:03,475
<font color=#FFFF00>I went to a grief seminar in Casper.</font>

394
00:37:04,317 --> 00:37:05,393
<font color=#FFFF00>You know that?</font>

395
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,650
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't know why...</font>

396
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,250
<font color=#FFFF00>I just wanted the bad to go away.</font>

397
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:18,900
<font color=#FFFF00>Wanted answers
to questions that couldn't be answered.</font>

398
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:27,130
<font color=#FFFF00>The counselor came up to me
after the seminar.. sat down next to me.</font>

399
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,200
<font color=#FFFF00>He said something that stuck with me.</font>

400
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:38,380
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know of it's what he said.
Or it's how he said...</font>

401
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:46,630
<font color=#FFFF00>He says, "I got some good news
and I got some bad news."</font>

402
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,985
<font color=#FFFF00>The bad news is
you're never gonna be the same.</font>

403
00:37:50,817 --> 00:37:53,508
<font color=#FFFF00>"You'll never be whole. Not ever again."</font>

404
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:59,633
<font color=#FFFF00>You lost your daughter.
Nothing's ever going to replace that.</font>

405
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,868
<font color=#FFFF00>"The good news is
as soon as you accept that...</font>

406
00:38:02,869 --> 00:38:04,697
<font color=#FFFF00>... and you let yourself suffer. "</font>

407
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,500
<font color=#FFFF00>"You'll allow yourself
to visit her in your mind."</font>

408
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,090
<font color=#FFFF00>"You remember all the love that she gave."</font>

409
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,940
<font color=#FFFF00>"All the joy she knew."</font>

410
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:30,040
<font color=#FFFF00>The point is, Martin
you can't steer from the pain.</font>

411
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,510
<font color=#FFFF00>If you do
you'll rob yourself.</font>

412
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,730
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll rob yourself of every memory of her.</font>

413
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:45,680
<font color=#FFFF00>Every last one.</font>

414
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:51,490
<font color=#FFFF00>From the first step...
to her last smile.</font>

415
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,190
<font color=#FFFF00>You kill 'em all.</font>

416
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:59,010
<font color=#FFFF00>Just take the pain, Martin.</font>

417
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,680
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you hear me? You take it.</font>

418
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:09,350
<font color=#FFFF00>It's the only way to keep her with you.</font>

419
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,840
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just tired, Cory.</font>

420
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,860
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just.. so tired
of fighting this life.</font>

421
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,390
<font color=#FFFF00>What you do now you is for your boy.</font>

422
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:30,820
<font color=#FFFF00>Drugs is his family now.</font>

423
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,790
<font color=#FFFF00>He's gone too.</font>

424
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:37,580
<font color=#FFFF00>Lives right down the damn
road, but it's...</font>

425
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,980
<font color=#FFFF00>He's gone.</font>

426
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:44,970
<font color=#FFFF00>I expect they'll find he's involved
in this somehow.</font>

427
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:49,472
<font color=#FFFF00>He is staying with the Little feather
boys, that it?</font>

428
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:54,390
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah.</font>

429
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:58,370
<font color=#FFFF00>You're driving this Fed around
so she don't get lost, is that it?</font>

430
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:02,040
<font color=#FFFF00>They asked me to do,</font>

431
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,360
<font color=#FFFF00>Not what I'm doing.</font>

432
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,830
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing?</font>

433
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,800
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm a hunter.. Martin.</font>

434
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:17,160
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you think I'm doing?</font>

435
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,550
<font color=#FFFF00>If you find out who did this...</font>

436
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:30,390
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't care who it is.</font>

437
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:32,990
<font color=#FFFF00>You understand me?</font>

438
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,780
<font color=#FFFF00>Right where they stand.</font>

439
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:40,130
<font color=#FFFF00>Then get off my porch
and go do it.</font>

440
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:29,526
<font color=#FFFF00>Natalie's brother lives here with
Sam and Bart Little feather.</font>

441
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,560
<font color=#FFFF00>And a real piece of work named Frank Walker.</font>

442
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:38,529
<font color=#FFFF00>Hanson's kid is bad... but
the others are stone evil.</font>

443
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:39,617
<font color=#FFFF00>So.. watch yourself.</font>

444
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,780
<font color=#FFFF00>Shouldn't we just..
maybe wait for some backup?</font>

445
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:48,050
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, this ain't the land of back-up, Jane.
This is the land of you're on your own.</font>

446
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,420
<font color=#FFFF00>Listen to this shit.</font>

447
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,640
<font color=#FFFF00>Ya?</font>

448
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,570
<font color=#FFFF00>We are looking for Chip Hanson. He around?</font>

449
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:24,750
<font color=#FFFF00>- Not here, brah..
- Who are you?</font>

450
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:29,160
<font color=#FFFF00>Who the fuck are you?</font>

451
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:32,550
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm the FBI, dickhead.
Are you Sam?</font>

452
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,070
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

453
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:36,170
<font color=#FFFF00>You high right now Sam?</font>

454
00:42:36,643 --> 00:42:38,776
<font color=#FFFF00>How many times have I arrested you?</font>

455
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:44,280
<font color=#FFFF00>- Chief, wazzup Brah?
- Where's your brother?</font>

456
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:49,760
<font color=#FFFF00>- He's in prison. Where you put him..
- What no parole?</font>

457
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:53,010
<font color=#FFFF00>Look at that,
the justice system at work.</font>

458
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:57,950
<font color=#FFFF00>Reminds me, my PO told me to give you some..</font>

459
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:02,230
<font color=#FFFF00>- Wait, I got it, I got it right here.
- Wait.. Let me see your hands!</font>

460
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:18,570
<font color=#FFFF00>Cory watch the back!</font>

461
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:20,830
<font color=#FFFF00>Fuck!</font>

462
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,160
<font color=#FFFF00>Fuck!</font>

463
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:08,378
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Heros have always killed cowboys.</i></font>

464
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,237
<font color=#FFFF00>The other two's outside with Cory.
Let's go.</font>

465
00:45:25,238 --> 00:45:26,081
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go.</font>

466
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:29,140
<font color=#FFFF00>He's still alive.
We need to call EMS.</font>

467
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:30,950
<font color=#FFFF00>EMS is an hour away.</font>

468
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:36,140
<font color=#FFFF00>- Just leave him.
- He's not dead, Ben.</font>

469
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:47,030
<font color=#FFFF00>Like I said.</font>

470
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:49,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go.</font>

471
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,300
<font color=#FFFF00>- You okay?
- Yeah.</font>

472
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:10,790
<font color=#FFFF00>- Skinny one's Natalie's brother..
- Who's the other one?</font>

473
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:14,110
<font color=#FFFF00>That is Frank Walker.</font>

474
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:16,510
<font color=#FFFF00>Won't your daddy be proud?</font>

475
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:20,250
<font color=#FFFF00>- My dad's in prison, asshole..
- I know, I put him there.</font>

476
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,736
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell me what happened to your sister, Chip.</font>

477
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:24,045
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

478
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:28,260
<font color=#FFFF00>- Don't play dumb.
- About what? What happened to her?</font>

479
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:35,430
<font color=#FFFF00>What that cracker do?</font>

480
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:40,103
<font color=#FFFF00>What crackers?
Was she seeing a white guy?</font>

481
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:41,790
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know him?</font>

482
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:45,110
<font color=#FFFF00>- Do you know who he is?
- Do you know his name, Chip?</font>

483
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:49,170
<font color=#FFFF00>You said was.</font>

484
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,020
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you say
was?</font>

485
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,060
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would she say was?</font>

486
00:46:56,270 --> 00:46:57,900
<font color=#FFFF00>She just said was.</font>

487
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:02,480
<font color=#FFFF00>Because I found her raped and
killed right over there, son.</font>

488
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:06,240
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why.</font>

489
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:11,900
<font color=#FFFF00>No...</font>

490
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,180
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

491
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,068
<font color=#FFFF00>No!</font>

492
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,569
<font color=#FFFF00>You go. I'm going to get
Chip over to Lander.</font>

493
00:47:32,669 --> 00:47:34,509
<font color=#FFFF00>See if he give me the
name of this boyfriend.</font>

494
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,870
<font color=#FFFF00>I tell you..this is how we find him?</font>

495
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:39,742
<font color=#FFFF00>No. We go to where he works or
where he lives.</font>

496
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:44,820
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah.. where does he work
where does he live.</font>

497
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,510
<font color=#FFFF00>You think this asshole's
gonna tell you anything? I don't.</font>

498
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:52,090
<font color=#FFFF00>Look, I know you're looking for clues,
but you're missing all the signs.</font>

499
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:53,930
<font color=#FFFF00>Come here, let me show you.</font>

500
00:47:56,810 --> 00:47:59,850
<font color=#FFFF00>See this here?
This is snow track.. right?</font>

501
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:02,350
<font color=#FFFF00>- Okay.
- Is he out here on the ridge?</font>

502
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:05,540
<font color=#FFFF00>Here... use these.</font>

503
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:07,540
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

504
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:10,260
<font color=#FFFF00>- You see at the end of the ridge here?
- Where?</font>

505
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:13,800
<font color=#FFFF00>- Follow my hand. Can you see my hand?
- Hand's all I can see.</font>

506
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,660
<font color=#FFFF00>When I take it away.. now look.</font>

507
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:22,110
<font color=#FFFF00>- You see that? You see the shadow there?
- I think so.</font>

508
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:23,230
<font color=#FFFF00>Snow's starting to cover.</font>

509
00:48:23,231 --> 00:48:26,132
<font color=#FFFF00>Look up at the base of the mountain.
There you see. Go up the ridge there.</font>

510
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,251
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll see it a lot of easy there.
You see the tracks go up..</font>

511
00:48:28,328 --> 00:48:29,298
<font color=#FFFF00>that mountain there?</font>

512
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,380
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes, I see it.
- Alright.</font>

513
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Now his body was found just past there.</font>

514
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:41,270
<font color=#FFFF00>But someone unloaded the sledge right here,
to go all the way out there.</font>

515
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:44,130
<font color=#FFFF00>There is no tracks coming back. Why's that?</font>

516
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:48,490
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm telling you.
The answer is out there.</font>

517
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:55,200
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey look... um..</font>

518
00:48:56,830 --> 00:49:00,660
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know how to do this. Okay?
I'm not a tracker.</font>

519
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,260
<font color=#FFFF00>That's okay, it's all I do.</font>

520
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,255
<font color=#FFFF00>- You asked to help you, right?
- Yeah.</font>

521
00:49:09,455 --> 00:49:11,710
<font color=#FFFF00>We should go while I still can.</font>

522
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:14,680
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

523
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:36,220
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are we stopping?</font>

524
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:39,550
<font color=#FFFF00>About the storm now...</font>

525
00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:41,950
<font color=#FFFF00>The trees are too thick to drive.</font>

526
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:44,370
<font color=#FFFF00>Gotta walk from here.</font>

527
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,570
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on.</font>

528
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,180
<font color=#FFFF00>- Put this on.
- Okay.</font>

529
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,050
<font color=#FFFF00>Clap them up real tight ok?</font>

530
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,040
<font color=#FFFF00>Now what?</font>

531
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,500
<font color=#FFFF00>We walk.</font>

532
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:09,570
<font color=#FFFF00>Follow these sledge tracks heading south.</font>

533
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,140
<font color=#FFFF00>- you ready?
- Yeah.</font>

534
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:12,690
<font color=#FFFF00>Follow me.</font>

535
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:43,640
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my god.</font>

536
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:19,640
<font color=#FFFF00>We went on foot the last half mile of it.</font>

537
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,250
<font color=#FFFF00>but we blazed a pretty good trail
on the snow.. so,</font>

538
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:24,900
<font color=#FFFF00>I could take the boys back up
there if you want.</font>

539
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:29,184
<font color=#FFFF00>III talk to the BIA Supervisor,
he just might want you to do that.</font>

540
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:33,870
<font color=#FFFF00>The security team over at the rig
got the cameras around their perimeter.</font>

541
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:35,070
<font color=#FFFF00>Im gonna head up there in
the morning,</font>

542
00:51:35,071 --> 00:51:37,116
<font color=#FFFF00>we might get lucky to find
something on the tape.</font>

543
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:42,800
<font color=#FFFF00>The two we have in custody
say anything?</font>

544
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:45,551
<font color=#FFFF00>They ain't the talking kind,
Jane.</font>

545
00:51:45,552 --> 00:51:49,048
<font color=#FFFF00>These kids... they expect to
go to prison.</font>

546
00:51:49,049 --> 00:51:51,662
<font color=#FFFF00>Hell, I think they look
forward to it. You know?</font>

547
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:54,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Three hoots, and a cot,
and free cable?</font>

548
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,580
<font color=#FFFF00>Anything better being here...
the way they see it.</font>

549
00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:02,210
<font color=#FFFF00>Lets r their DNA against the
semen, see what that tells us.</font>

550
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:04,330
<font color=#FFFF00>- Can I talk to him?
- No.</font>

551
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:06,255
<font color=#FFFF00>Cory, anything they might tell you
would be inadmissible in court,</font>

552
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:08,387
<font color=#FFFF00>and anything you tell us would render</font>

553
00:52:08,587 --> 00:52:10,182
<font color=#FFFF00>everything that resulted
inadmissible as well.</font>

554
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:13,360
<font color=#FFFF00>What if don't tell you.
If I just knew it.</font>

555
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,770
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, agent Banner.</font>

556
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:22,450
<font color=#FFFF00>Ben.</font>

557
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:25,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Ive known this kid since he could walk.</font>

558
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:28,240
<font color=#FFFF00>I gotta canvas the house.</font>

559
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:32,130
<font color=#FFFF00>The back doors are only locked
from the inside...</font>

560
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:56,530
<font color=#FFFF00>Look at you.</font>

561
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,940
<font color=#FFFF00>Look at you.
I didnt do shit.</font>

562
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:08,510
<font color=#FFFF00>All you been doing is shit for
the last few years.</font>

563
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:13,670
<font color=#FFFF00>... Its this place. Look what it
takes from us.</font>

564
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,720
<font color=#FFFF00>What it took from you.</font>

565
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,909
<font color=#FFFF00>Im not going to stand here
and tell you that life's fair,</font>

566
00:53:20,009 --> 00:53:23,930
<font color=#FFFF00>Cause it ain't.
To either of us.</font>

567
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:28,030
<font color=#FFFF00>But you know, what do we go?</font>

568
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:32,497
<font color=#FFFF00>This land is all we got left.</font>

569
00:53:32,498 --> 00:53:33,869
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this we shit...?</font>

570
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:38,280
<font color=#FFFF00>Only thing native about you is your ex-wife
and a daughter you couldnt protect</font>

571
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,240
<font color=#FFFF00>Maybe if
youd played detective back then...</font>

572
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:44,670
<font color=#FFFF00>That's not something you get to talk about.</font>

573
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:47,570
<font color=#FFFF00>You hear me?</font>

574
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:49,810
<font color=#FFFF00>Over there.</font>

575
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:58,630
<font color=#FFFF00>You gonna lecture me about
protecting people?</font>

576
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:01,330
<font color=#FFFF00>While you deal the shit thats killing em?</font>

577
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:05,187
<font color=#FFFF00>Unlike most people...</font>

578
00:54:05,188 --> 00:54:08,270
<font color=#FFFF00>... You had every chance to
get the hell out if thats what you wanted.</font>

579
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:10,780
<font color=#FFFF00>You got the Army. You got College.
Whatever is your choice.</font>

580
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:12,330
<font color=#FFFF00>Look what you choose.</font>

581
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,550
<font color=#FFFF00>Look what you chose.</font>

582
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,150
<font color=#FFFF00>God damn you.</font>

583
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:21,930
<font color=#FFFF00>I met him.</font>

584
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:27,330
<font color=#FFFF00>Ya?</font>

585
00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:30,240
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, the motherfucker was
almost as old as you.</font>

586
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:34,970
<font color=#FFFF00>I wanted to fight
his ass.</font>

587
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,660
<font color=#FFFF00>Natalie wouldnt let me.</font>

588
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:41,760
<font color=#FFFF00>Guess love really is blind huh?</font>

589
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:47,340
<font color=#FFFF00>He works security on one of them drill site.</font>

590
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:53,190
<font color=#FFFF00>This boyfriend have a name?</font>

591
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:57,540
<font color=#FFFF00>Matt... Matt something...</font>

592
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:02,890
<font color=#FFFF00>- Who does?
- Sam knew. Why dont you ask him?</font>

593
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:07,240
<font color=#FFFF00>I think you'll be talking to Sam
long before I do.</font>

594
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:09,590
<font color=#FFFF00>You think this is who I wanted to be?</font>

595
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:20,310
<font color=#FFFF00>I get so mad..
I want to fight the whole world.</font>

596
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:25,140
<font color=#FFFF00>You got any idea what's that feel like.</font>

597
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:27,840
<font color=#FFFF00>I do.</font>

598
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,560
<font color=#FFFF00>I decided to fight the
feeling instead. Know why?</font>

599
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:37,350
<font color=#FFFF00>Because I fear that the world would win.</font>

600
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:46,510
<font color=#FFFF00>What did I tell you...
Did he say anything?</font>

601
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:49,260
<font color=#FFFF00>No. Fuck it..
I don't. I don't wanna know.</font>

602
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:52,890
<font color=#FFFF00>Youre heading for the rigs
tomorrow ain't you? yeah.</font>

603
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:56,960
<font color=#FFFF00>- Natalies boyfriend worked there.

604
00:55:57,270 --> 00:56:01,320
<font color=#FFFF00>- No, you are not to tell me.
- The thing's solve when it will solve.</font>

605
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,050
<font color=#FFFF00>Cory.</font>

606
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,490
<font color=#FFFF00>I want you at the rig with us tomorrow.</font>

607
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:10,842
<font color=#FFFF00>We don't catch wolves
looking at where they might be.</font>

608
00:56:10,843 --> 00:56:12,255
<font color=#FFFF00>Head for where they've been.</font>

609
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:15,090
<font color=#FFFF00>They've been right here.</font>

610
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:37,780
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>What do you want?</font>

614
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:52,200
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know.</font>

615
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:56,460
<font color=#FFFF00>Brings all back, doesnt it.</font>

616
00:56:59,070 --> 00:57:00,210
<font color=#FFFF00>Maybe.</font>

617
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:07,570
<font color=#FFFF00>You and Ben and this little FBI girl formed
your own posse to go solve it all, I hear.</font>

618
00:57:10,210 --> 00:57:13,044
<font color=#FFFF00>- Just trying to help.
- You won't get the answers..</font>

619
00:57:13,132 --> 00:57:14,478
<font color=#FFFF00>..you're looking for.</font>

620
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,410
<font color=#FFFF00>No matter what you find.</font>

621
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:24,210
<font color=#FFFF00>This is not about Emily.</font>

622
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,610
<font color=#FFFF00>Good bye, Cory.</font>

623
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:04,180
<font color=#FFFF00>Matt Rayburn.</font>

624
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:07,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you know him?</font>

625
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:12,960
<font color=#FFFF00>- That's the guy we found in the snow?
- Yes, fingerprints from the database.</font>

626
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:17,010
<font color=#FFFF00>He was a security contractor
for one of the drill stations.</font>

627
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:19,440
<font color=#FFFF00>Alright.</font>

628
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:23,620
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that it?</font>

629
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,520
<font color=#FFFF00>Am I fired now?</font>

630
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:29,940
<font color=#FFFF00>- Why don't you come inside? Warm up.
- Okay.</font>

631
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:40,300
<font color=#FFFF00>- You.. want something to drink?
- Sure.</font>

632
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:45,310
<font color=#FFFF00>You got the..
milk and coffee and well water.</font>

633
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:48,000
<font color=#FFFF00>- Water is good.
- Okay.</font>

634
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:51,400
<font color=#FFFF00>Right, um.. make yourself at home.</font>

635
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:15,580
<font color=#FFFF00>- Here you go.
- Thanks.</font>

636
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:24,100
<font color=#FFFF00>That's my daughter Emily.</font>

637
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:27,100
<font color=#FFFF00>She passed three years ago.</font>

638
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:30,920
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

639
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,700
<font color=#FFFF00>You want to know how.. do you?</font>

640
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,760
<font color=#FFFF00>I do, but...</font>

641
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:44,140
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's do this.</font>

642
00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:49,424
<font color=#FFFF00>I was working as an outfitter in Pinedale.</font>

643
00:59:49,425 --> 00:59:55,020
<font color=#FFFF00>And there was a big snow,
so I found myself with a rare night off.</font>

644
00:59:56,050 --> 01:00:00,150
<font color=#FFFF00>So I got a motel called the wife,
she can come up stay for the night.</font>

645
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:05,500
<font color=#FFFF00>I mean you got 2 kids and when you're
at the mountain for half of the years.</font>

646
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:08,530
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't get much time together.</font>

647
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:13,842
<font color=#FFFF00>So we had Emily look after Casey
who was 5 at that time.</font>

648
01:00:13,843 --> 01:00:15,165
<font color=#FFFF00>She was 16.</font>

649
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:19,200
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess that word got out that
we are out of town.</font>

650
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:23,600
<font color=#FFFF00>So some school friends came over
and some more friends.</font>

651
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,010
<font color=#FFFF00>Then...</font>

652
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,280
<font color=#FFFF00>And then some people came
that weren't friends.</font>

653
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:34,050
<font color=#FFFF00>So a little gathering
turned into a quite the party I guess.</font>

654
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:36,720
<font color=#FFFF00>Then...</font>

655
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:40,130
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know.</font>

656
01:00:41,830 --> 01:00:44,130
<font color=#FFFF00>You know there is a lot I don't know.</font>

657
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:51,950
<font color=#FFFF00>We got that phone call the next morning.</font>

658
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:54,830
<font color=#FFFF00>From Natalie.</font>

659
01:00:56,610 --> 01:00:58,500
<font color=#FFFF00>Said that Emily was missing.</font>

660
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:04,330
<font color=#FFFF00>She was worried, naturally,
they were best friends.</font>

661
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:10,250
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah.. We tried to be
very careful with Emily.</font>

662
01:01:12,550 --> 01:01:14,620
<font color=#FFFF00>Tried to plan for everything.</font>

663
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:22,840
<font color=#FFFF00>She was such a good girl.</font>

664
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:26,990
<font color=#FFFF00>But we let our guard down.</font>

665
01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:32,810
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah. Let me tell you.
Maybe you'll have kids one day.</font>

666
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:36,950
<font color=#FFFF00>You cannot blink.</font>

667
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:41,590
<font color=#FFFF00>Not once, not ever.</font>

668
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:48,760
<font color=#FFFF00>Then there was a guy moving sheep
over by the wind river.</font>

669
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:50,850
<font color=#FFFF00>He is the one who found her.</font>

670
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:55,040
<font color=#FFFF00>Some 20 miles from our house.</font>

671
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:58,370
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know how she got there
or what happened.</font>

672
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:02,560
<font color=#FFFF00>Autopsy couldn't tell us much
cause the Coyotes got at her pretty good.</font>

673
01:02:06,310 --> 01:02:10,390
<font color=#FFFF00>No, I'm sorry...</font>

674
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:15,750
<font color=#FFFF00>- Sorry.
- Could you point me...</font>

675
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:20,970
<font color=#FFFF00>towards your bathroom?</font>

676
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:24,330
<font color=#FFFF00>- Straight up there.
- Thanks.</font>

677
01:02:50,214 --> 01:02:53,854
<font color=#FFFF00><i>A Meadow in My perfect world.</i></font>

678
01:02:53,954 --> 01:02:55,000
<font color=#FFFF00>Emily wrote that.</font>

679
01:02:59,570 --> 01:03:03,630
<font color=#FFFF00>It's what got her accepted into the
summer writing program in Colorado state.</font>

680
01:03:05,530 --> 01:03:07,270
<font color=#FFFF00>Did she write it to you?</font>

681
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:15,670
<font color=#FFFF00>Doesn't matter who it's to.</font>

682
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:19,510
<font color=#FFFF00>Just matters who it's from.</font>

683
01:03:25,930 --> 01:03:29,910
<font color=#FFFF00>Look I'm sorry about..
earlier tonight.</font>

684
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:34,520
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just trying to do the right thing here.</font>

685
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:38,160
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't really know
what the Hanson boy told you but...</font>

686
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:43,430
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't wanna stumble onto something
like today if I can help it.</font>

687
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:48,319
<font color=#FFFF00>So you know, if he said something
that I should know...</font>

688
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,499
<font color=#FFFF00>... I would appreciate if you share it.</font>

689
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:55,110
<font color=#FFFF00>He only said.. he said,
Natalie's boyfriend was named Matt.</font>

690
01:03:56,130 --> 01:03:58,730
<font color=#FFFF00>And you've already figured out
who that is, so...</font>

691
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:02,110
<font color=#FFFF00>You get a call for that information, huh?</font>

692
01:04:02,690 --> 01:04:05,000
<font color=#FFFF00>I wanted to know why you're helping me.</font>

693
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,380
<font color=#FFFF00>Now I do. So..</font>

694
01:04:08,890 --> 01:04:10,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Tomorrow...</font>

695
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:16,220
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think we could not ride
the snowmobile 80 miles an hour?</font>

696
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:20,250
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, if you wanna end up in a ditch,
we could have jumped over..</font>

697
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:22,580
<font color=#FFFF00>Great.</font>

698
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:24,816
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

699
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,800
<font color=#FFFF00>- Have a good night.
- All right.</font>

700
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:34,540
<font color=#FFFF00>- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.</font>

701
01:04:53,170 --> 01:04:54,493
<font color=#FFFF00>Shaking more than she is.</font>

702
01:04:54,494 --> 01:04:57,299
<font color=#FFFF00>That's cold enough to freeze
a gold digger's ass out here.</font>

703
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:58,806
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, below zero, I bet.</font>

704
01:04:58,835 --> 01:05:01,178
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, six below,
it's lot colder up here.</font>

705
01:05:02,290 --> 01:05:03,320
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, bud.</font>

706
01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:07,070
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hey, how are you doing?
- What are you doing here?</font>

707
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:09,582
<font color=#FFFF00>These track lead from the
little feather' house to your body.</font>

708
01:05:09,583 --> 01:05:12,437
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm gonna follow them.
See where they go?</font>

709
01:05:12,472 --> 01:05:14,666
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, well, Jane's the only one with
jurisdiction out there.</font>

710
01:05:14,866 --> 01:05:17,060
<font color=#FFFF00>Just wanted a few extra badges along.</font>

711
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:19,880
<font color=#FFFF00>- You wanna walk 'em through this?
- Oh sure yeah.</font>

712
01:05:20,810 --> 01:05:23,414
<font color=#FFFF00>The drill station has
cameras along its perimeter.</font>

713
01:05:23,415 --> 01:05:25,485
<font color=#FFFF00>We're hoping one of the cameras
caught something.</font>

714
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:29,300
<font color=#FFFF00>And we'll also canvas
Matt Rayburn's trailer.</font>

715
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,630
<font color=#FFFF00>See if there is anything
that links him to the assault.</font>

716
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:35,160
<font color=#FFFF00>- You have a warrant?
- I'm going to ask real nice.</font>

717
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:38,330
<font color=#FFFF00>Can't get that from
little feather house?</font>

718
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:40,919
<font color=#FFFF00>Now that's a real tough slade
right through two canyons.</font>

719
01:05:41,295 --> 01:05:44,150
<font color=#FFFF00>And I ain't looking to dig you out so...
I won't recommend it.</font>

01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:46,050
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll take the refinery road around.</font>

01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:48,504
<font color=#FFFF00>See you gotta drive 50 miles to go 5.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Yeah does Matt Rayburn work here?
- Yeah. You know where he is?</font>

728
01:09:13,890 --> 01:09:16,280
<font color=#FFFF00>I was about to ask you the same thing.</font>

729
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:19,821
<font color=#FFFF00>No. he got in a fight with his girlfriend
a couple of days ago.</font>

730
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:23,321
<font color=#FFFF00>She took off, he took her back.
Then we have not seen 'em since.</font>

731
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:25,630
<font color=#FFFF00>- When was that?
- Three days ago.</font>

732
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:27,221
<font color=#FFFF00>Heck, we didn't know what to do.</font>

733
01:09:27,222 --> 01:09:28,436
<font color=#FFFF00>We've been waiting
on the corp. ever since...</font>

termination papers, or call you guys.</font>

735
01:09:31,590 --> 01:09:33,710
<font color=#FFFF00>- Everything okay?
- Yeah yeah, they are here for Matt.</font>

736
01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:36,090
<font color=#FFFF00>You find him? Is he okay?</font>

737
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:38,680
<font color=#FFFF00>- What happened to you two?
- What's that?</font>

741
01:09:49,410 --> 01:09:51,540
<font color=#FFFF00>You should try using a face shield.</font>

742
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:55,510
<font color=#FFFF00>I requested helmets.. our supervisor said,
"Snow's soft, ain't it?"</font>

743
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:57,480
<font color=#FFFF00>Corporate in Texas,

744
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:02,100
<font color=#FFFF00>- Does Matt bunk here on the property?
- Yeah, yeah, we all do.</font>

745
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:08,070
<font color=#FFFF00>- Can we see his trailer?
- Yeah, sure come on. I'll walk you up.</font>

01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:40,020
<font color=#FFFF00>So did.. did something happen to him?
You know where he is?</font>

749
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:42,050
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what we are trying to find out.</font>

750
01:11:42,270 --> 01:11:44,780
<font color=#FFFF00>His girlfriend filed a
missing person's report..</font>

751
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:47,088
<font color=#FFFF00>Well how can that be?
Thought you guys found her in a snow drifter</font>

752
01:11:47,288 --> 01:11:48,061
<font color=#FFFF00>right before the storm.</font>

753
01:11:48,261 --> 01:11:48,900
<font color=#FFFF00>Excuse me?</font>

754
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,830
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard her name go out over the radio
when you guys found her.</font>

755
01:11:52,030 --> 01:11:53,970
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't remember using her name.</font>

756
01:11:55,950 --> 01:11:57,850
<font color=#FFFF00>Maybe you weren't listening.</font>

757
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:02,960
<font color=#FFFF00>- The fuck are you doing?

You got us on three sides.</font>

815
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:20,290
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, well... My carriage wanted to
catch the eight oclock show in Lander.</font>

816
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,127
<font color=#FFFF00>So she dropped me off at the turn-out.</font>

called Point Mugu right..</font>

834
01:17:23,259 --> 01:17:24,877

01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:38,887
<font color=#FFFF00>So I just.. I got my truck

841
01:17:38,888 --> 01:17:41,914
<font color=#FFFF00>... and I wound up in a
little mountain town called Ojai.</font>

01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:46,580
<font color=#FFFF00>I get there and it's like.. fruit farms.
Vineyards...</font>

843
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:50,320
<font color=#FFFF00>And there is this mountain surrounding it
you know like protecting the town.</font>

844
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:54,510
<font color=#FFFF00>And the people there...

845
01:17:54,710 --> 01:17:56,440
<font color=#FFFF00>They say hello... it's like</font>

They had these looks in their eyes</font>

848
01:18:01,710 --> 01:18:05,220
<font color=#FFFF00>Like they ran on some sort of secret
like they had all figured it out.</font>

849
01:18:05,790 --> 01:18:08,685
<font color=#FFFF00>There is this mission, the Spanish mission
right there in the middle of the town.</font>

850
01:18:08,838 --> 01:18:10,065
<font color=#FFFF00>They are having Christmas mass.</font>

851
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:13,845
<font color=#FFFF00>They're celebrating Christmas.

an orange of the tree...</font>

853
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:20,830
<font color=#FFFF00>... and sat down on a bench, to listen that
choir singing, eating my orange.</font>

854
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:26,220
<font color=#FFFF00>You know that was the best Christmas
I've ever had.</font>

981
01:32:37,730 --> 01:32:41,330
<font color=#FFFF00>If you can make it to that highway,

<font color=#FFFF00>What do you want me to do?!</font>

991
01:33:13,590 --> 01:33:15,010
<font color=#FFFF00>I want you to run.</font>

992
01:34:47,110 --> 01:34:48,670
<font color=#FFFF00>How you feeling?</font>

993
01:34:50,120 --> 01:34:51,670
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel okay.</font>

994
01:34:53,210 --> 01:34:54,430
<font color=#FFFF00>Got you something.</font>

995
01:34:55,780 --> 01:34:59,050
<font color=#FFFF00>Thought maybe it give you a little
taste of home.</font>

996
01:35:05,030 --> 01:35:08,390
<font color=#FFFF00>- Crocodile.
- Please don't make me laugh.</font>

997
01:35:10,490 --> 01:35:12,345
<font color=#FFFF00>It's an alligator.</font>

998
01:35:14,010 --> 01:35:17,130
<font color=#FFFF00>I hope it protects you
better than bullet-proof vests right?</font>

999
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:22,910
<font color=#FFFF00>I should not joke about that,
it saved your life.</font>

1000
01:35:24,910 --> 01:35:26,890
<font color=#FFFF00>You saved my life.</font>

1001
01:35:30,270 --> 01:35:31,340
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

1002
01:35:37,780 --> 01:35:39,480
<font color=#FFFF00>Jane, you're a tough woman.</font>

1003
01:35:40,690 --> 01:35:42,250
<font color=#FFFF00>You saved your own life.</font>

1004
01:35:44,100 --> 01:35:46,390
<font color=#FFFF00>We both should be honest.</font>

1005
01:35:48,430 --> 01:35:50,140
<font color=#FFFF00>I got lucky.</font>

1006
01:35:50,950 --> 01:35:53,510
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah. well, luck don't live out here.</font>

1007
01:35:54,550 --> 01:35:56,150
<font color=#FFFF00>Luck lives in the city.</font>

1008
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:01,010
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't live out here.</font>

1009
01:36:03,830 --> 01:36:07,410
<font color=#FFFF00>It lives where you get hit by a bus or not.</font>

1010
01:36:08,310 --> 01:36:10,810
<font color=#FFFF00>Where your bank is robbed or not.</font>

1011
01:36:11,010 --> 01:36:14,348
<font color=#FFFF00>At someone's damn cell phone
when he come up to a crosswalk.</font>

1012
01:36:14,349 --> 01:36:19,510
<font color=#FFFF00>That's luck, that's winning or losing.
Out here you survive or you surrender.</font>

1013
01:36:20,470 --> 01:36:23,230
<font color=#FFFF00>That's determined by your strength
and bare spirit.</font>

1014
01:36:25,110 --> 01:36:27,510
<font color=#FFFF00>Wolves don't kill the unlucky deer.</font>

1015
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:32,180
<font color=#FFFF00>They kill the weak ones.
You fought for your life Jane.</font>

1016
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:36,730
<font color=#FFFF00>And now you get to walk away with it.</font>

1017
01:36:42,160 --> 01:36:43,560
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll get to go home.</font>

1018
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:54,880
<font color=#FFFF00>I know what you're doing.</font>

1019
01:36:56,810 --> 01:36:58,890
<font color=#FFFF00>Will read to you from a magazine.</font>

1020
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:05,010
<font color=#FFFF00>"10 Signs that He's Into You."</font>

1021
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:12,040
<font color=#FFFF00>"He looks you in the eye when he speaks."</font>

1022
01:37:14,660 --> 01:37:16,070
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it supposed to be?</font>

1023
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:21,640
<font color=#FFFF00>She ran 6 miles in the snow.</font>

1024
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:36,290
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, she did.</font>

1025
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,180
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello?</font>

1026
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:58,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Martin?</font>

1027
01:38:12,950 --> 01:38:14,180
<font color=#FFFF00>Martin!</font>

1028
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:17,940
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey..</font>

1029
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:28,970
<font color=#FFFF00>Martin?</font>

1030
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:03,030
<font color=#FFFF00>Annie?</font>

1031
01:40:49,310 --> 01:40:50,350
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

1032
01:40:57,090 --> 01:40:58,550
<font color=#FFFF00>What's with the paint?</font>

1033
01:41:00,730 --> 01:41:02,640
<font color=#FFFF00>It's my death face.</font>

1034
01:41:04,610 --> 01:41:05,980
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that right?</font>

1035
01:41:09,710 --> 01:41:11,320
<font color=#FFFF00>How would you know what that it is?</font>

1036
01:41:13,530 --> 01:41:14,590
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't.</font>

1037
01:41:16,060 --> 01:41:17,354
<font color=#FFFF00>Just made it up.</font>

1038
01:41:17,355 --> 01:41:19,530
<font color=#FFFF00>Guess no one left to teach her.</font>

1039
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:30,460
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right as..</font>

1040
01:41:33,670 --> 01:41:35,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Then the phone rang...</font>

1041
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:38,620
<font color=#FFFF00>... which is never good.</font>

1042
01:41:40,700 --> 01:41:42,400
<font color=#FFFF00>But today it was.</font>

1043
01:41:45,710 --> 01:41:48,300
<font color=#FFFF00>First time Chip's called me in over a year.</font>

1044
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:53,510
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is he?</font>

1045
01:41:54,930 --> 01:41:56,490
<font color=#FFFF00>Police station.</font>

1046
01:41:59,300 --> 01:42:01,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Just gonna go pick him up...</font>

1047
01:42:01,660 --> 01:42:04,450
<font color=#FFFF00>... as soon as I wipe this shit of my face.</font>

1048
01:42:07,420 --> 01:42:09,200
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard about what happened.</font>

1049
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:14,390
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard there's one still missing.</font>

1050
01:42:15,660 --> 01:42:16,780
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

1051
01:42:19,350 --> 01:42:20,770
<font color=#FFFF00>No one's missing.</font>

1052
01:42:25,430 --> 01:42:26,840
<font color=#FFFF00>How did he go out?</font>

1053
01:42:31,490 --> 01:42:32,850
<font color=#FFFF00>With a whimper.</font>

1054
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:41,670
<font color=#FFFF00>You better go easy on Chip.</font>

1055
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:51,860
<font color=#FFFF00>I should go get him.</font>

1056
01:42:54,160 --> 01:42:56,910
<font color=#FFFF00>I just need to sit here...</font>

1057
01:42:59,700 --> 01:43:01,350
<font color=#FFFF00>... You gonna sit for a minute?</font>

1058
01:43:06,720 --> 01:43:08,600
<font color=#FFFF00>You got time to sit with me?</font>

1059
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:12,840
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, I ain't going nowhere.</font>
