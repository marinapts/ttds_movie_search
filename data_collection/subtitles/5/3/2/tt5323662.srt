"Bank"

6
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:18,959
I'll withdraw all savings.

14
00:03:55,626 --> 00:03:57,250
Hey, sit down all.

15
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,417
We have a new classmate from today.

16
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:08,584
What?

17
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:11,459
You're lucky! A girl.

18
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:15,083
I'm not interested at all.

19
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:29,834
Well,

20
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:32,918
Then introduce yourself.

21
00:04:55,876 --> 00:04:57,667
"For written communication"

22
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:02,125
"Nice to meet you. I am Shoko Nishimiya."

23
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:09,501
"I want to be friends with you all with this notebook."

24
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:17,083
"Please use this notebook when you talk to me."

25
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:27,709
"I can't hear."

26
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:30,584
Unbelievable...

27
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:39,959
Super!

28
00:05:40,584 --> 00:05:41,876
"Hi, Nishimiya-san. I am Miki Kawai."

29
00:05:41,876 --> 00:05:43,751
Hi, nice to meet you.

30
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:48,209
Hey, Nishimiya-san, can you speak Japanese?

31
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:51,000
Nao-chan, how you say...

32
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,417
"Once again please."

33
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,918
What were you called from friends?

34
00:06:03,042 --> 00:06:05,167
Give up, give up!

35
00:06:05,292 --> 00:06:07,209
I see, "Sho-chan".

36
00:06:08,292 --> 00:06:10,083
That's same as Ishida.

37
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:11,792
She is called Sho-chan, too.

38
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:13,083
That's funny.

39
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,167
What? Not funny at all!

40
00:06:19,501 --> 00:06:22,876
Please write down what I'm saying.

41
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:28,250
From page 20 to page 25, and drills of page 32.

42
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,250
It is the scope of the next small test.

43
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:35,250
Give me your notebook.

44
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:40,459
First, "fulcrum". The point that supports the strength.

45
00:06:40,626 --> 00:06:44,000
Next, "the effort point", the point the strength is taken.

46
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:47,626
"The point of loading", the point that have weight.

47
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:50,626
With these 3 points, levers can be categorized...

48
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:13,751
Nishimiya-san,

49
00:07:13,876 --> 00:07:16,417
You are too fast to start.

50
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:18,125
I will...

51
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:20,167
teach you the timing, okay?

52
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:25,209
Then, let's start again.

53
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:30,959
How should we do the coming chorus competition?

54
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,501
We already lose, don't we?

55
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:35,959
That's the penalty for saying weird things!

56
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,542
Ouch, ouch!

57
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:39,626
Ouch!

58
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,125
So today,

59
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:44,584
I missed what teacher said again due to her...

60
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:46,375
I'll lend my notebook.

61
00:07:46,751 --> 00:07:48,417
Thank you.

62
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:52,542
"I am not wrong."

63
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:54,792
"That's why I will never say sorry."

64
00:07:54,918 --> 00:07:57,250
What a poor reading, Ueno.

65
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:01,000
Crap. That's enough. Next.

66
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:02,667
To the hell, ugly glasses.

67
00:08:02,876 --> 00:08:04,125
Nishimiya.

68
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,876
From this sentence.

69
00:08:22,876 --> 00:08:25,375
Okay. Good. Next, Ishida.

70
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:27,709
Really? Unbelievable.

71
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,334
Hey, Ishida!

72
00:08:47,542 --> 00:08:49,834
"Please let me know what you are talking about."

73
00:09:14,626 --> 00:09:15,876
Let's go home.

74
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,542
Bye-bye, Nishimiya-san.

75
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:53,709
Hey you,

76
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:59,000
At this rate, won't you frustrate classmates?

77
00:10:01,876 --> 00:10:02,876
What?

78
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,834
{\an8}<i>SL: I,</i>

79
00:10:04,834 --> 00:10:05,918
{\an8}<i>SL: And you,</i>

80
00:10:06,042 --> 00:10:08,667
{\an8}<i>SL: Friends?</i>

81
00:10:07,417 --> 00:10:09,167
fie-nds...

82
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,626
What?

83
00:10:14,792 --> 00:10:16,626
Disgusting!

84
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,459
I'm Kita, of a special education class.

85
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:31,167
Today I wanna talk about "Shuwa" - sign language.

86
00:10:31,334 --> 00:10:33,876
Write as "speaking with hands" and pronounce "Shu-wa".

87
00:10:34,584 --> 00:10:38,501
As the word says, Shuwa means speaking using your hands.

88
00:10:38,626 --> 00:10:40,209
Isn't it amazing?

89
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:42,167
Sign...language...

90
00:10:42,334 --> 00:10:45,459
So I propose a 3-minute lesson of sign language everyday morning,

91
00:10:45,751 --> 00:10:49,834
to understand Shoko-chan even more.

92
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:54,292
Teacher.

93
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,501
Yes?

94
00:10:55,626 --> 00:10:57,959
Isn't it enough to use her notebook?

95
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:03,417
It's easier for Shoko-chan using sign language.

96
00:11:04,792 --> 00:11:08,709
It's easier for me using the notebook.

97
00:11:10,751 --> 00:11:14,959
I'll learn sign language.

98
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,417
"Teach me sign language for Sahara Miyoko"

99
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,209
Sa - Ara

100
00:11:23,918 --> 00:11:26,751
I - Jo - ko

101
00:11:26,918 --> 00:11:28,334
Got it!

102
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:29,542
Sa - a ...

103
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:31,417
Good job getting brownie points.

104
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:35,209
I love him so much. He is so handsome.

105
00:11:35,334 --> 00:11:36,334
Agree!

106
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:39,834
He will be in the drama next week. Must watch!

107
00:11:40,417 --> 00:11:42,209
Don't you think her clothes are ugly?

108
00:11:42,584 --> 00:11:44,751
Stop it, Nao-chan.

109
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,876
The author described through this work,...

110
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,167
After the experiment, manganese dioxide should be...

111
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:59,292
Hirose, you write that side.

112
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,918
Ni-shi-mi-ya.

113
00:12:02,334 --> 00:12:04,250
What are you doing, Ishida ?

114
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,876
Isn't better to stop that?

115
00:12:06,334 --> 00:12:07,584
Star.

116
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:09,792
Ishida, you did too much.

117
00:12:10,042 --> 00:12:12,417
No, no, it's what it should be.

118
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:15,167
You're a bad guy.

119
00:12:15,292 --> 00:12:17,459
Nice, nice.

120
00:12:17,751 --> 00:12:19,459
It's really nice.

121
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:21,751
Congrats, Nishimiya-san. Sahara-san went away because of you!

122
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:29,584
Congrats, Nishimiya-san. Sahara-san went away because of you!

123
00:12:29,626 --> 00:12:32,667
That's so bad! Who did such nasty things!

124
00:12:33,042 --> 00:12:34,375
Too bad!

125
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:38,292
I...will...kindly...

126
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:40,417
erase...it...for...you...

127
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:41,709
Okay.

128
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,918
All erased.

129
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:59,626
"Thank you."

130
00:13:02,584 --> 00:13:04,876
You are welcome.

131
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:06,501
Let's go.

132
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:11,167
Joumon-era was...

133
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:18,876
Hey, Ishida.

134
00:13:19,417 --> 00:13:21,125
Class is not over.

135
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,667
I see. I'm sorry.

136
00:13:24,584 --> 00:13:27,334
Well...I have lost where I was talking at...

137
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:30,834
Well, what kind of house were they living. They lived..

138
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,709
So surprised, are you?

139
00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:37,375
Hey, Nishimiya-san.

140
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:43,209
Is this mean you can actually hear?

141
00:13:43,334 --> 00:13:46,459
Yeah, I thought the same thing, too.

142
00:13:46,584 --> 00:13:48,000
Please let me see it for a while?

143
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:52,292
Ueno.

144
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:54,501
What is it? Give me.

145
00:13:58,542 --> 00:14:00,667
Oh, what is this?

146
00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:02,751
It's filthy!

147
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:23,459
Wh--What?

148
00:14:23,584 --> 00:14:24,209
Oh my god,

149
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,292
Nishimiya-san, are you okay?

150
00:14:26,792 --> 00:14:28,876
How should I do....?

151
00:14:29,751 --> 00:14:31,542
Nishimiya-san...

152
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:33,626
Hey, you did too far.

153
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:38,083
Crap, so annoying, ugly glasses.

154
00:14:41,334 --> 00:14:43,042
What? Go away.

155
00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:44,709
Don't interrupt.

156
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:48,042
What is she doing?

157
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:49,459
Let's go home.

158
00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:52,417
"I'm sorry."

159
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:54,667
You're a liar!

160
00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:56,751
If you want to say something to me, say it!

161
00:14:59,501 --> 00:15:00,292
What!?

162
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:02,375
Stop it, you are disgusting!

163
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:05,792
Oh, Nishimiya-san is funny!

164
00:15:05,918 --> 00:15:07,626
Shoya, you are blushing, aren't you?

165
00:15:07,751 --> 00:15:09,250
No, I'm not!

166
00:15:09,334 --> 00:15:10,459
{\an8}<i>SL: I,</i>

167
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:12,083
{\an8}<i>SL: And you,</i>

168
00:15:13,626 --> 00:15:15,834
{\an8}<i>SL: Friends?</i>

169
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,250
Let's go.

170
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,751
Oh, is she serious, Nishimiya-san?

171
00:15:32,918 --> 00:15:34,292
It's unbelievable!

172
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:46,250
See you tomorrow, Shoya.

173
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:04,334
Well, today I have a topic I want to talk to you all.

174
00:16:04,501 --> 00:16:09,000
It's about Nishimiya-san, who is absent today.

175
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:13,709
Yesterday we had a call from Nishimiya-san's mother.

176
00:16:14,209 --> 00:16:19,459
She said 8 of Nishimiya-san's hearing aids have gone missing

177
00:16:19,584 --> 00:16:21,709
or been damaged in just 5 months.

178
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:26,501
Nishimiya-san's mother worries if she is bullied at school.

179
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:31,667
If any of you know anything about bullying

180
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:36,000
or similar harassments to Nishimiya-san, please let us know.

181
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:41,667
We hear her hearing aids are very expensive.

182
00:16:47,292 --> 00:16:51,667
So please confess, before your parents are in trouble.

183
00:16:51,751 --> 00:16:52,751
Hey, Ishida.

184
00:16:54,792 --> 00:16:57,792
We all know it was you.

185
00:16:58,209 --> 00:16:59,501
Stand up right now!

186
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Yes.

187
00:17:02,709 --> 00:17:03,876
Ueno.

188
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,375
How did you thought, seeing next to him?

189
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:12,751
He might do something to kidding her or so?

190
00:17:13,751 --> 00:17:15,125
How about you, Shimada?

191
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:16,667
I'd been saying

192
00:17:16,792 --> 00:17:19,834
"hey, stop it" to him,

193
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:21,501
but Shoya didn't stopped.

194
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:24,792
Hey, Shimada,

195
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:27,459
You did with me together, didn't you?

196
00:17:27,584 --> 00:17:30,209
And, girls said bad things about her so many times.

197
00:17:33,292 --> 00:17:35,250
Especially Ueno and Kawai did.

198
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,876
How cruel you are..

199
00:17:39,417 --> 00:17:42,083
I never do such things.

200
00:17:42,209 --> 00:17:43,834
Why you tell such a lie?

201
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:45,667
Ishida-kun, you are too bad.

202
00:17:45,792 --> 00:17:47,334
He made her cry.

203
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,918
Why it is here...?

204
00:18:18,918 --> 00:18:20,792
I see. Yes.

205
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:24,459
I'm very sorry.

206
00:18:25,209 --> 00:18:27,375
I see. I see.

207
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:29,209
Thank you for calling.

208
00:18:31,918 --> 00:18:33,375
Shoya.

209
00:18:33,626 --> 00:18:35,501
Stop now, Shoya!

210
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:37,542
Shoya.

211
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,876
I got a call from school.

212
00:18:40,751 --> 00:18:41,751
Hey...

213
00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:43,876
Why are you so wet?

214
00:18:44,042 --> 00:18:46,751
Shut up, Jumped in the river like always.

215
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:48,375
Wait.

216
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:50,167
Don't you make a trouble with someone?

217
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:52,167
I don't know.

218
00:18:52,334 --> 00:18:55,417
Is what your teacher said correct?

219
00:18:55,542 --> 00:18:57,792
Y...Yes!

220
00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:03,584
Prepare to go out right now. We have to meet Nishimiya-san's.

221
00:19:09,459 --> 00:19:10,459
(Mizuho Bank)

222
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:13,209
Sho-chan, let's go home.

223
00:20:14,209 --> 00:20:16,876
Be a good child from tomorrow, okay?

224
00:20:20,751 --> 00:20:21,751
These are missing...

225
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:26,083
Great men and women experienced hard time, and...

226
00:20:29,876 --> 00:20:30,709
"Shoya Ishida"

227
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,209
What are you doing?

228
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,918
Hey, what are you doing with my desk?

229
00:21:02,042 --> 00:21:04,792
What were you doing. Disgusting!

230
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:12,125
Same smile again.

231
00:21:12,876 --> 00:21:15,250
Don't pretend to be a good girl!

232
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:17,876
What?

233
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,250
If you wanna say something to me, say it now!

234
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:23,083
Every time you show that disgusting smile instead.

235
00:21:23,209 --> 00:21:25,000
You are angry, aren't you!?

236
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,125
Hey!

237
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,375
Say something!

238
00:21:28,501 --> 00:21:29,626
Ouch!

239
00:21:29,834 --> 00:21:30,876
What are you doing!

240
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
What?!

241
00:21:43,584 --> 00:21:45,334
Doigg mai bezd...

242
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,000
I'b doigg mai bezd!

243
00:21:50,417 --> 00:21:52,834
What are you saying?!

244
00:21:56,417 --> 00:21:57,709
What!

245
00:21:57,834 --> 00:21:59,667
I can't understand what you say!

246
00:22:19,751 --> 00:22:20,751
"Disappear, Ishida."

247
00:22:28,167 --> 00:22:29,542
Crap...

248
00:22:29,667 --> 00:22:31,042
She is so disgusting...

249
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:35,042
Nishimiya-san has transferred to another school.

250
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:38,375
Huh.

251
00:22:38,501 --> 00:22:42,250
Hey, our class journal was not submitted today.

252
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:44,626
Who is in charge?

253
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:48,417
And, who is in charge of keeping the flowers?

254
00:23:09,709 --> 00:23:11,459
"Sign language study class"

255
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:23,334
{\an8}<i>SL: Hello.</i>

256
00:23:22,626 --> 00:23:25,209
Hi, Shoko-chan. Hello.

257
00:23:35,626 --> 00:23:36,667
Nishimiya!

258
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:45,250
Do you remember me?

259
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:47,542
I was your classmate of the elementary school...

260
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:50,334
Shoya Ishida.

261
00:24:00,292 --> 00:24:01,792
Nishimiya?

262
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:03,250
Wait!

263
00:24:08,042 --> 00:24:09,042
Nishimiya!

264
00:24:12,042 --> 00:24:13,292
Where?

265
00:24:14,209 --> 00:24:15,375
Nishimiya.

266
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,375
H...Hi.

267
00:24:25,542 --> 00:24:27,459
Well...

268
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:30,417
Here it is.

269
00:24:30,584 --> 00:24:32,709
I came here to give it to you.

270
00:24:35,959 --> 00:24:36,959
This is "what you left behind."

271
00:24:42,584 --> 00:24:45,667
You say "why sign language?"

272
00:24:45,876 --> 00:24:47,042
I leaned it.

273
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:49,584
And, here...

274
00:24:53,709 --> 00:24:56,792
You might not want to see this again.

275
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,000
Well...

276
00:25:03,918 --> 00:25:05,501
I...and...

277
00:25:05,626 --> 00:25:06,709
Nishimiya,

278
00:25:08,584 --> 00:25:10,167
can we be

279
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:12,417
friends?

280
00:25:13,792 --> 00:25:15,417
Damn, what am I saying!?

281
00:25:16,459 --> 00:25:19,792
H...hey, you said so in the past.

282
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:21,417
I finally understood what you said...

283
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:27,417
Please don't cry.

284
00:25:29,042 --> 00:25:31,417
Please don't cry, Nishimiya.

285
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:42,667
Can I be friends with you?

286
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,584
Sho-tan,

287
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:47,375
Sho-tan,

288
00:25:47,918 --> 00:25:51,125
Sho-tan, wake up!

289
00:25:53,834 --> 00:25:55,501
Breakfast!

290
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:03,709
Sho-chan, wake up!

291
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,375
Good morning, Maria.

292
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:10,542
Sho-tan woke up!

293
00:26:27,751 --> 00:26:29,375
I'll go.

294
00:26:29,501 --> 00:26:32,584
Mama, bye bye!

295
00:26:32,876 --> 00:26:34,000
Here, Sho-chan.

296
00:26:36,334 --> 00:26:38,209
Let's eat.

297
00:26:38,334 --> 00:26:40,292
Dig in!

298
00:26:44,584 --> 00:26:46,000
Huh?

299
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:48,250
Why you are so smiling.

300
00:26:49,834 --> 00:26:51,834
Because of...

301
00:26:52,876 --> 00:26:53,667
this!

302
00:26:54,751 --> 00:26:57,209
You worked hard,

303
00:26:57,334 --> 00:27:00,542
and you sold everything, even including beddings.

304
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,209
I'm very happy for all of your efforts.

305
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,209
By the way, Sho-chan...

306
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:13,751
Why did you try to kill yourself?

307
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:17,667
Yeah, actually,

308
00:27:17,792 --> 00:27:20,459
It's a long story you know,

309
00:27:20,584 --> 00:27:22,334
But it comes to be...

310
00:27:22,459 --> 00:27:23,959
I knew it...

311
00:27:25,709 --> 00:27:27,834
I knew it!

312
00:27:27,959 --> 00:27:29,667
I knew something was going on around you!

313
00:27:30,209 --> 00:27:34,000
Your room was extraordinarily vacant, your phone was out of service,

314
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:37,000
and the calendar in your room...

315
00:27:37,459 --> 00:27:40,375
Pages after April were torn off...

316
00:27:41,167 --> 00:27:44,375
Right now promise you never try to kill yourself, or I'll burn this.

317
00:27:44,501 --> 00:27:47,626
This 1,700,000 yen you worked hard and earned!

318
00:27:50,417 --> 00:27:52,792
Hey, are you listening to me!?

319
00:27:54,959 --> 00:27:56,125
Don't be stupid, mom...

320
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,083
YOU ARE stupid, what an ungrateful child you are!

321
00:27:58,209 --> 00:27:59,751
Hey, well, ah...

322
00:27:59,918 --> 00:28:00,918
Sorry.

323
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,375
I'm really sorry.

324
00:28:02,501 --> 00:28:03,292
I'll stop.

325
00:28:03,417 --> 00:28:05,042
I'll stop. I'm sorry. Really!

326
00:28:05,167 --> 00:28:07,083
You'll stop what, say clearly!

327
00:28:07,918 --> 00:28:09,542
I'll stop trying to kill myself!

328
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:11,792
I'll stop trying to kill myself!

329
00:28:12,542 --> 00:28:13,834
Really?

330
00:28:14,417 --> 00:28:15,542
Really.

331
00:28:16,334 --> 00:28:18,292
Okay, that's a promise.

332
00:28:19,959 --> 00:28:22,083
Hey! Mon!

333
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:27,375
Hey, water, water!

334
00:28:36,501 --> 00:28:38,000
Yesterday, I had thought

335
00:28:38,167 --> 00:28:41,751
to kill myself by jumping into a river from a very high bridge.

336
00:28:43,167 --> 00:28:46,751
The reason I went to meet Nishimiya was also a ceremony before it.

337
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:51,334
It was my biggest braveness challenge all of my life,

338
00:28:51,459 --> 00:28:53,292
but the story was changed...

339
00:29:07,584 --> 00:29:09,167
"Friend"

340
00:29:13,959 --> 00:29:15,918
Shame! Why did I say such a thing!?

341
00:29:17,334 --> 00:29:20,250
When we just entered junior high school, Shimada said;

342
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,459
You'd better stay away from a guy Shoya Ishida.

343
00:29:25,584 --> 00:29:26,626
He is...

344
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:28,959
a bully.

345
00:29:32,918 --> 00:29:37,918
What I did would all return to myself.

346
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:40,167
I fully realized

347
00:29:40,292 --> 00:29:44,626
that I had to owe the responsibility of what I had did.

348
00:29:45,167 --> 00:29:48,667
And I was isolated.

349
00:29:49,042 --> 00:29:51,042
Good morning.

350
00:30:26,542 --> 00:30:28,417
Then

351
00:30:28,709 --> 00:30:31,834
Translate these sentences by the next lesson.

352
00:30:41,292 --> 00:30:42,292
Ishida-kun.

353
00:30:42,417 --> 00:30:43,501
Yes.

354
00:30:43,792 --> 00:30:45,292
Kawai...

355
00:30:45,417 --> 00:30:48,083
Can I gather your math homework if you finish it?

356
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,042
Oh...sorry, I have forgotten it.

357
00:30:50,167 --> 00:30:51,292
Okay, I see.

358
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:53,250
Please finish it soon as the deadline is coming.

359
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:55,501
Yes, I will. Sorry.

360
00:30:58,501 --> 00:31:00,083
Let's have lunch outside.

361
00:31:02,417 --> 00:31:06,375
"Ishida-kun is always alone as you can see."

362
00:31:06,501 --> 00:31:09,334
"Everyone knows it."

363
00:31:09,459 --> 00:31:11,709
Oh, really?

364
00:31:11,876 --> 00:31:14,834
"Oh, he is looking at us as always."

365
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:17,834
"Isn't he feeling desperate always being alone?"

366
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,876
"He will be same as now forever."

367
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,334
"Why is he still living?"

368
00:31:26,876 --> 00:31:28,792
H...Hi, here it is.

369
00:31:28,918 --> 00:31:30,667
I just bought this limited edition, and...

370
00:31:30,834 --> 00:31:31,959
Oops.

371
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:33,959
Then I'll quit to be a fan of them.

372
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:35,709
Me too.

373
00:31:41,334 --> 00:31:42,626
That's the reality...

374
00:32:02,167 --> 00:32:04,584
I remember that hair.

375
00:32:06,209 --> 00:32:07,709
Who is he?

376
00:32:18,292 --> 00:32:19,501
By the way,

377
00:32:19,792 --> 00:32:22,584
can I meet Nishimiya again?

378
00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:26,000
She said she feeds carp in the river.

379
00:32:26,626 --> 00:32:29,792
How can I do so by what reason?

380
00:32:32,167 --> 00:32:34,292
Can I see her to apologize what I did?

381
00:32:35,876 --> 00:32:38,417
She said she'll be there every Tuesday.

382
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:40,792
Am I weird if I visit again?

383
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:55,125
I'm home.

384
00:33:05,584 --> 00:33:07,000
Sho---chan?

385
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,876
I'm so surprised.

386
00:33:10,375 --> 00:33:11,417
What?

387
00:33:13,709 --> 00:33:16,083
I'm very sorry for what happened in the morning.

388
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:20,292
I burned money you earned hard.

389
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:26,334
But I don't want to use any money

390
00:33:26,459 --> 00:33:27,959
you saved to die.

391
00:33:29,792 --> 00:33:31,959
Sorry, I'll save up again.

392
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:34,167
Thanks.

393
00:33:34,292 --> 00:33:36,334
You can be slower this time, okay?

394
00:33:36,501 --> 00:33:38,792
You are hungry, huh? Let's have dinner.

395
00:33:38,918 --> 00:33:40,667
Hungry!

396
00:33:50,626 --> 00:33:52,542
Tuesday.

397
00:33:56,876 --> 00:33:59,876
Hey you, why don't you lend your bike to me?

398
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:00,792
Me?

399
00:34:00,834 --> 00:34:03,751
Oh, the guy I remember.

400
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:07,292
I left something behind. I want to go home to get it.

401
00:34:07,417 --> 00:34:10,250
Huh? What are you saying?

402
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:12,209
You should use your own one.

403
00:34:12,334 --> 00:34:15,542
I ask you 'cause I don't have my own.

404
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,876
Stop it please.

405
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Hey, don't resist.

406
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:20,417
Hey, stop it!

407
00:34:21,042 --> 00:34:22,751
Someone please help me!

408
00:34:24,334 --> 00:34:25,459
Someone!

409
00:34:25,959 --> 00:34:27,459
Oh, dear.

410
00:34:27,751 --> 00:34:29,042
Please, please help me! Help! Help!

411
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:30,667
Shut up!

412
00:34:34,042 --> 00:34:35,918
Stop resisting!

413
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:38,000
H...hey.

414
00:34:38,792 --> 00:34:40,250
I...I'll lend you my own.

415
00:34:40,751 --> 00:34:44,334
Really!? You are super!

416
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:50,292
It was ripped off.

417
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:53,876
Actually, today of all day is Tuesday.

418
00:34:54,042 --> 00:34:57,501
This means I should not see her again?

419
00:34:58,209 --> 00:35:00,417
Of course I still can go on foot,

420
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,667
but it seems as I was advised not to go.

421
00:35:04,792 --> 00:35:06,918
I want a reason.

422
00:35:10,876 --> 00:35:13,959
A smart,

423
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:16,250
and natural reason to see her again.

424
00:35:21,334 --> 00:35:23,959
"Discount coupon for a brand-new bread ?"

425
00:35:25,501 --> 00:35:26,876
That's it!

426
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:29,000
Well...Is Nishimiya-san here?

427
00:35:29,584 --> 00:35:30,709
No, she isn't

428
00:35:31,626 --> 00:35:32,667
She is, isn't she?

429
00:35:32,792 --> 00:35:34,501
No, she isn't

430
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:37,626
Shoko Nishimiya isn't here.

431
00:35:38,501 --> 00:35:39,709
Sorry but,

432
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:42,876
are you really a friend of Shoko?

433
00:35:43,918 --> 00:35:45,167
Bye.

434
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:51,292
{\an8}<i>SL: What?</i>

435
00:35:51,834 --> 00:35:53,292
Nothing.

436
00:35:54,709 --> 00:35:56,876
A rat was there.

437
00:35:57,042 --> 00:35:59,167
A big creepy one.

438
00:36:02,083 --> 00:36:04,626
Don't be afraid. It won't come again.

439
00:36:12,292 --> 00:36:14,083
Friend...

440
00:36:29,334 --> 00:36:30,876
Why...is he here?

441
00:36:32,209 --> 00:36:33,792
O--Oh, he is!

442
00:36:34,042 --> 00:36:35,667
Ishida-kun!

443
00:36:35,792 --> 00:36:37,876
Look! Look at this!

444
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,542
A bike! It's yours, isn't it?

445
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:44,042
Good timing!

446
00:36:44,751 --> 00:36:48,167
It was so lucky that your address was written on the bike.

447
00:36:48,542 --> 00:36:51,709
Wh...where was this bike?

448
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,626
It was abandoned in a rice paddy.

449
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:56,292
I looked for this all over the time!

450
00:36:56,709 --> 00:36:59,876
I'm glad I got it back to you!

451
00:37:07,209 --> 00:37:08,626
Is something wrong, Ishida-kun?

452
00:37:09,792 --> 00:37:11,918
Well..

453
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:13,334
Your name?

454
00:37:13,459 --> 00:37:15,792
Oops! I'm Nagatsuka!

455
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:18,250
I sit just behind you in the class.

456
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,542
Don't you eat some bread?

457
00:37:21,959 --> 00:37:24,959
This is so good, Nagatsuka-kun.

458
00:37:25,292 --> 00:37:27,209
Ishida-kun!

459
00:37:27,792 --> 00:37:29,083
Ishida-kun.

460
00:37:30,501 --> 00:37:32,542
Good morning!

461
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,083
Good morning...

462
00:37:36,501 --> 00:37:37,501
Ishida-kun!

463
00:37:38,334 --> 00:37:40,167
Why don't we hang out after school?

464
00:37:40,501 --> 00:37:42,667
As we are friends now.

465
00:37:43,334 --> 00:37:45,667
Ishida-kun, come here, come here!

466
00:38:08,667 --> 00:38:10,834
What's wrong with you, Ya-sho?

467
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,459
Nothing.

468
00:38:13,584 --> 00:38:14,918
Ya... "Ya-sho"?

469
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,918
Sounds like a "big friend", doesn't it?

470
00:38:20,083 --> 00:38:21,959
Anyway, what are you worrying about?

471
00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:25,876
You can tell anything, 'cause we are real friends.

472
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:32,459
Nagatsuka-kun,

473
00:38:32,834 --> 00:38:36,000
what is the definition of "friends"?

474
00:38:36,334 --> 00:38:37,918
A kind of license,

475
00:38:38,042 --> 00:38:40,167
or right or something like that,

476
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,542
to become friends with someone.

477
00:38:44,459 --> 00:38:46,125
Hey, Ya-sho.

478
00:38:49,542 --> 00:38:50,751
Give me your hand.

479
00:39:04,501 --> 00:39:06,501
This is friendship.

480
00:39:06,709 --> 00:39:08,959
I think, Ishida-kun,

481
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:14,209
friendship exists beyond words and logic.

482
00:39:14,459 --> 00:39:17,501
License? No such things are needed.

483
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,209
It's a ridiculous idea.

484
00:39:21,709 --> 00:39:22,709
She is not here.

485
00:39:23,501 --> 00:39:24,501
She is, isn't she?

486
00:39:24,751 --> 00:39:25,751
She isn't.

487
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:28,626
Huh, who are you anyway?

488
00:39:28,751 --> 00:39:31,125
I'm Shoko's boyfriend.

489
00:39:32,667 --> 00:39:34,959
Oops! ... Dropped.

490
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:37,751
Haha, that not about me, but a bread.

491
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,959
O...oh, really?

492
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:42,542
Nishimiya likes younger guys.

493
00:39:42,626 --> 00:39:45,459
I'm a little surprised that.

494
00:39:45,584 --> 00:39:47,542
Okay, then how about giving this bread to her at least?

495
00:39:47,667 --> 00:39:48,417
This is a very good bread.

496
00:39:48,542 --> 00:39:49,542
Hey.

497
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:54,125
Don't be here again, if you only want to satisfy yourself.

498
00:39:57,542 --> 00:39:59,083
Are you satisfied?

499
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Then bye.

500
00:40:02,042 --> 00:40:03,417
Hey boy!

501
00:40:03,542 --> 00:40:06,334
My friend wants to see Nishimiya-san!

502
00:40:06,459 --> 00:40:09,584
Stop complaining and bring her here right now!

503
00:40:09,709 --> 00:40:11,918
Nagatsuka-kun, why are you here?

504
00:40:12,959 --> 00:40:13,834
I followed you.

505
00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:15,709
Sounds like a behavior of best friends?

506
00:40:15,959 --> 00:40:19,375
Haha, so the friend of a turd had a turd hair.

507
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:21,083
Hey, you a turd-hair!

508
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,209
Wh---what are you saying?!

509
00:40:25,167 --> 00:40:27,751
Say that again boy!

510
00:40:27,876 --> 00:40:30,042
Turd-hair, turd-hair, turd-hair!

511
00:40:30,167 --> 00:40:32,709
What's happening?

512
00:40:32,834 --> 00:40:33,918
Is that Yuzuru-chan?

513
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:35,417
Oh, no. They are fighting.

514
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,459
Nagatsuka-kun, Nagatsuka-kun!

515
00:40:38,667 --> 00:40:40,167
Stop it, okay?

516
00:40:40,417 --> 00:40:42,834
Nagatsuka-kun, that's enough, let's go home now.

517
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:44,334
Nagatsuka-ku...

518
00:40:45,292 --> 00:40:48,125
Oh? Aren't you the boy of the other day?

519
00:40:48,584 --> 00:40:51,167
I--it's not like that!

520
00:40:51,501 --> 00:40:52,626
Nagatsuka-kun, sorry for leaving you!

521
00:40:58,542 --> 00:40:59,751
Oh, crap!

522
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:02,042
Crap, she found and met him.

523
00:41:02,167 --> 00:41:03,709
Good for you, Ishida-kun!

524
00:41:05,918 --> 00:41:07,334
Hey boy.

525
00:41:07,417 --> 00:41:09,000
You are peeping now, aren't you?

526
00:41:09,584 --> 00:41:11,667
Let me use it now!

527
00:41:12,459 --> 00:41:13,501
What?

528
00:41:12,709 --> 00:41:17,125
{\an8}<i>SL: Long time no see.</i>

529
00:41:13,626 --> 00:41:16,459
Ishida-kun is waving his hands.

530
00:41:16,584 --> 00:41:17,959
Wouldn't it be sign language?

531
00:41:17,334 --> 00:41:19,209
{\an8}<i>SL: Have you been well?</i>

532
00:41:18,083 --> 00:41:19,125
Really!?

533
00:41:19,542 --> 00:41:23,292
Wow, I didn't know he has such a skill.

534
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:25,667
Hey, can you read their sign language?

535
00:41:25,667 --> 00:41:26,667
Then translate it for me!

536
00:41:28,876 --> 00:41:31,834
Who was that turd-hair just now?

537
00:41:29,292 --> 00:41:31,417
{\an8}<i>SL: I'm glad to see you again.</i>

538
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:35,375
{\an8}<i>SL: Are you okay leaving your sign language class?</i>

539
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,209
I don't know such turd.

540
00:41:35,792 --> 00:41:37,626
Oops, he was so creepy!

541
00:41:37,834 --> 00:41:39,918
S-T-O-P J-O-K-I-N-G!

542
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:41,667
Leave me alone!

543
00:41:44,042 --> 00:41:46,125
Be careful not to fall, boy.

544
00:41:46,626 --> 00:41:48,292
"Honestly,"

545
00:41:48,959 --> 00:41:51,876
"I thought I shouldn't see you again."

546
00:41:52,667 --> 00:41:54,918
"The meaning of being friends."

547
00:41:55,083 --> 00:41:59,542
"I've been thinking of it for all these 2 weeks."

548
00:42:00,292 --> 00:42:02,083
"The reason to..."

549
00:42:02,834 --> 00:42:05,542
"see you again."

550
00:42:07,542 --> 00:42:09,417
"I have been looking for it."

551
00:42:12,083 --> 00:42:13,083
Ishida-kun...

552
00:42:14,584 --> 00:42:16,125
"I'm glad."

553
00:42:16,292 --> 00:42:19,417
"I thought"

554
00:42:19,584 --> 00:42:20,792
"the same thing as you."

555
00:42:21,751 --> 00:42:23,292
"It's strange, isn't it?"

556
00:42:26,834 --> 00:42:29,584
Nishimiya, here it is. A bread.

557
00:42:29,751 --> 00:42:30,792
To feed carp.

558
00:42:37,209 --> 00:42:38,876
Is this feeding fun?

559
00:42:40,417 --> 00:42:41,918
Oh, I was just reminded.

560
00:42:53,209 --> 00:42:54,918
{\an8}<i>SL: Thank you.</i>

561
00:43:01,292 --> 00:43:02,292
Nishimiya...

562
00:43:02,375 --> 00:43:04,209
Y...you had better not read it...

563
00:43:04,334 --> 00:43:05,417
so much!

564
00:43:15,542 --> 00:43:17,042
Hey! wait, Nishimiya!

565
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,459
Oh! She fell!

566
00:43:22,584 --> 00:43:24,709
What!? Something happened to Ishida-kun!?

567
00:43:24,834 --> 00:43:25,459
Hey!

568
00:43:25,584 --> 00:43:26,876
Hey, boy!

569
00:43:27,626 --> 00:43:29,626
Oops! Ishida-kun fell to the river!

570
00:43:29,751 --> 00:43:30,751
Why!?

571
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:31,834
Ouch!

572
00:43:31,959 --> 00:43:33,167
Why you do so!

573
00:43:46,751 --> 00:43:48,250
Oops, what is this creepy thing!?

574
00:43:49,751 --> 00:43:50,209
Nishimiya.

575
00:43:58,876 --> 00:44:00,083
Nishimiya!

576
00:44:02,459 --> 00:44:05,167
Sorry for dropping the notebook.

577
00:44:15,167 --> 00:44:16,918
See you.

578
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:23,042
{\an8}<i>SL: See you again.</i>

579
00:44:31,792 --> 00:44:34,167
You're stupid, Shoko...

580
00:44:42,918 --> 00:44:44,751
"Any of you got more guts than me?"

581
00:44:44,751 --> 00:44:45,751
"Shoya Ishida"

582
00:44:49,209 --> 00:44:50,751
Stupid!

583
00:44:50,876 --> 00:44:52,459
Did you see this?

584
00:44:52,584 --> 00:44:54,918
Hey, isn't this guy Ishida-kun?

585
00:44:56,584 --> 00:44:58,042
"See you again."

586
00:44:59,417 --> 00:45:00,417
Can I?

587
00:45:03,125 --> 00:45:05,209
Hey.

588
00:45:05,918 --> 00:45:07,667
This is Ishida-kun, isn't it?

589
00:45:08,167 --> 00:45:09,167
This guy.

590
00:45:09,501 --> 00:45:10,501
What?

591
00:45:10,626 --> 00:45:12,334
What's this.

592
00:45:17,292 --> 00:45:20,918
Ishida-kun, come to the teachers' room right now.

593
00:45:21,334 --> 00:45:22,584
"Notice of short-term suspension from school - Shoya Ishida"

594
00:45:22,584 --> 00:45:26,334
"I am very sorry that I jumped into Suimon River from a bridge,"

595
00:45:26,459 --> 00:45:29,000
"where it was prohibited to do so, and..."

596
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:31,334
"uploaded that photo to the web... "

597
00:45:31,459 --> 00:45:32,959
Hey, Shoya.

598
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:38,292
Sorry but could you pick Maria back from the nursery?

599
00:45:38,417 --> 00:45:41,042
I'm in a school suspension term and prohibited to go out.

600
00:45:41,167 --> 00:45:44,250
It would be okay if you do it quickly. Please!!

601
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:45,584
H...hey!!

602
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:05,792
Maria, let's go home now!

603
00:46:05,918 --> 00:46:07,083
Sho-tan!

604
00:46:07,584 --> 00:46:09,542
Someone is there!

605
00:46:15,876 --> 00:46:16,876
Hey.

606
00:46:17,292 --> 00:46:19,584
Hey, are you okay?

607
00:46:22,042 --> 00:46:25,042
Aren't you Nishimiya's boyfriend?

608
00:46:25,375 --> 00:46:26,375
You'll catch a cold.

609
00:46:27,459 --> 00:46:30,375
Oh, you're the rat.

610
00:46:32,209 --> 00:46:35,292
What are you doing here?

611
00:46:37,542 --> 00:46:38,959
Shoes?

612
00:46:42,167 --> 00:46:43,250
...Why don't you get angry with me?

613
00:46:43,959 --> 00:46:44,959
On what?

614
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,334
It's me who uploaded your photo to the web.

615
00:46:50,459 --> 00:46:52,459
Oh, you did it.

616
00:46:54,626 --> 00:46:55,959
I got it.

617
00:46:56,083 --> 00:46:57,834
I am relieved to hear that.

618
00:46:58,292 --> 00:47:00,125
Why?

619
00:47:00,667 --> 00:47:05,000
I would know the reason why.

620
00:47:05,417 --> 00:47:06,709
Be mad with me.

621
00:47:06,834 --> 00:47:08,626
I cannot.

622
00:47:08,751 --> 00:47:11,459
Originally I am to be blamed.

623
00:47:11,792 --> 00:47:13,167
Sho-tan!

624
00:47:13,292 --> 00:47:15,292
I am hungry!

625
00:47:15,709 --> 00:47:17,083
Okay!

626
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:19,125
Then I'll go home.

627
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:20,834
You go home, too.

628
00:47:21,459 --> 00:47:23,792
Haha, you have a kid.

629
00:47:25,584 --> 00:47:27,209
It's not mine, my sis's!

630
00:47:37,709 --> 00:47:38,417
Hey!

631
00:47:41,209 --> 00:47:43,083
Hi Yuzuru-kun,

632
00:47:43,459 --> 00:47:45,501
Please eat enough!

633
00:47:45,626 --> 00:47:46,626
How about sis?

634
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:48,918
She'll work late today.

635
00:47:50,542 --> 00:47:52,167
Maria, isn't it too hot?

636
00:47:52,292 --> 00:47:54,209
No, it's good!

637
00:47:54,334 --> 00:47:56,751
Yuzuru-kun, why don't you eat?

638
00:47:57,584 --> 00:47:59,250
Hi, Yuzuru-kun!

639
00:48:00,709 --> 00:48:01,709
Please!

640
00:48:24,417 --> 00:48:26,125
{\an8}<i>SL: You should apologize,</i>

641
00:48:26,125 --> 00:48:29,417
{\an8}<i>SL: or I don't need you!</i>

642
00:48:31,459 --> 00:48:32,834
Crap...

643
00:48:56,083 --> 00:48:57,292
What's the matter with you.

644
00:48:58,375 --> 00:49:00,125
I was worried as you disappeared in the night.

645
00:49:01,959 --> 00:49:03,334
Hi, umbrella.

646
00:49:05,209 --> 00:49:06,709
Anyway, use it!

647
00:49:06,834 --> 00:49:08,209
Well, please use it now.

648
00:49:09,751 --> 00:49:10,834
Thank you.

649
00:49:11,209 --> 00:49:12,792
Well, excuse me.

650
00:49:12,918 --> 00:49:14,125
I knew that.

651
00:49:16,792 --> 00:49:18,083
I'll give you these.

652
00:49:18,209 --> 00:49:19,626
These were mine, but

653
00:49:20,042 --> 00:49:22,501
I won't use them anymore. I'll give you.

654
00:49:24,876 --> 00:49:27,959
Why you ran away home?

655
00:49:29,709 --> 00:49:31,959
I had an argument with Shoko.

656
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:36,167
That's a kind of a typical event

657
00:49:36,334 --> 00:49:39,501
for a long-lasting couple, isn't it?

658
00:49:39,959 --> 00:49:41,042
Yes.

659
00:49:41,417 --> 00:49:43,959
Like that I used Shoko's shampoo without her permission.

660
00:49:44,209 --> 00:49:45,417
I see...

661
00:49:45,584 --> 00:49:47,709
I was said she didn't need me.

662
00:49:49,918 --> 00:49:52,459
Hey, you live together with her!?

663
00:49:55,542 --> 00:49:57,667
Use your umbrella for you.

664
00:49:57,792 --> 00:49:59,083
You have only one, don't you?

665
00:50:00,292 --> 00:50:03,667
It's my mistake I brought only one umbrella.

666
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:07,792
And I feel sorry for Nishimiya if you catch cold.

667
00:50:10,209 --> 00:50:11,542
Hey you.

668
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:14,876
What kind of a man you intend to be? A hypocrite?

669
00:50:15,959 --> 00:50:18,501
You feel pleasure taking care of a stray cat?

670
00:50:18,709 --> 00:50:20,542
Or you make fun of doing it.

671
00:50:21,167 --> 00:50:24,209
And you also made fun that she couldn't hear.

672
00:50:25,501 --> 00:50:28,501
Then, now you learned sign language huh?

673
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:29,709
What's this?

674
00:50:29,834 --> 00:50:32,209
Do you think you have changed to be a good guy?

675
00:50:32,709 --> 00:50:34,918
You are disgusting.

676
00:50:38,918 --> 00:50:40,167
I see.

677
00:50:40,626 --> 00:50:43,626
It's natural you know what I did, hearing from Nishimiya.

678
00:50:44,918 --> 00:50:47,167
Yes. You are right.

679
00:50:47,584 --> 00:50:49,667
I'm the worst human being.

680
00:50:50,292 --> 00:50:52,918
I'm the one who don't worth living.

681
00:50:53,959 --> 00:50:55,209
But, at least,

682
00:50:56,042 --> 00:50:59,626
I thought I didn't want Nishimiya to cry again.

683
00:51:00,042 --> 00:51:03,918
Of course, I have no intention to interfere you two.

684
00:51:04,042 --> 00:51:05,751
Never.

685
00:51:06,918 --> 00:51:08,584
But, actually,

686
00:51:08,751 --> 00:51:10,918
It's an issue of myself, too...

687
00:51:26,918 --> 00:51:27,959
Thanks, it's enough here.

688
00:51:31,459 --> 00:51:32,876
Well..

689
00:51:33,501 --> 00:51:37,000
I'm very sorry that you perfectly believe what I said..

690
00:51:37,417 --> 00:51:38,751
But actually I'm Shoko's...

691
00:51:40,459 --> 00:51:41,459
Understood?

692
00:51:49,626 --> 00:51:50,667
You are her little sis!?

693
00:51:50,792 --> 00:51:51,792
Bye!

694
00:51:59,834 --> 00:52:02,834
Oh, Nishimiya-san's mother...

695
00:52:07,584 --> 00:52:08,792
Hey, let's go.

696
00:52:10,083 --> 00:52:12,709
Hey, it pains.

697
00:52:14,417 --> 00:52:16,626
I'm sorry...

698
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:22,125
I'm home.

699
00:52:22,417 --> 00:52:23,417
Yu-ju,

700
00:52:23,459 --> 00:52:24,834
Hey, sis!

701
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:26,959
I'b zorry, I'b zorry!

702
00:52:27,334 --> 00:52:29,417
Me too.

703
00:52:30,751 --> 00:52:33,459
I wanna drink grandma's beefsteak plant juice.

704
00:52:34,167 --> 00:52:35,375
Yuzuru.

705
00:52:35,709 --> 00:52:37,876
Don't be friends with such a guy.

706
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,876
Tell same thing to Shoko from you.

707
00:52:42,667 --> 00:52:45,000
We can decide such a thing by ourselves---

708
00:52:45,125 --> 00:52:46,918
both I and sis.

709
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,292
Hey boy!

710
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,125
Nice to see you!

711
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:53,584
Why are you here today?

712
00:52:53,918 --> 00:52:55,834
To return his umbrella I lend the other day.

713
00:52:55,959 --> 00:52:56,959
Oh boy.

714
00:52:57,042 --> 00:52:59,167
You are doing a good thing.

715
00:52:59,292 --> 00:53:01,834
Nagatsuka-kun, that child is not a boy...

716
00:53:02,292 --> 00:53:04,751
Little sis of Nishimiya.

717
00:53:06,209 --> 00:53:08,083
Of course, I knew it.

718
00:53:13,209 --> 00:53:16,083
I'm glad to see a friend of my best friend Ya-sho.

719
00:53:16,876 --> 00:53:18,083
He is my classmate,

720
00:53:18,209 --> 00:53:20,918
Na-ga-tsu-ka.

721
00:53:26,501 --> 00:53:28,459
I got my new smart phone.

722
00:53:29,167 --> 00:53:30,167
Well..

723
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:32,918
Do you have a smart phone too?

724
00:53:34,083 --> 00:53:36,375
Then do you enjoy texting?

725
00:53:36,626 --> 00:53:38,042
With your classmates?

726
00:53:38,167 --> 00:53:39,709
Of your current school?

727
00:53:40,292 --> 00:53:41,542
Oh, that's good.

728
00:53:41,667 --> 00:53:44,792
Then do you have someone you want to add to text?

729
00:53:45,459 --> 00:53:48,125
Someone you want to know the address.

730
00:53:48,626 --> 00:53:51,542
Great, then my address is...

731
00:53:52,167 --> 00:53:53,167
What?

732
00:53:53,792 --> 00:53:56,417
Sa...ha...ra.

733
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:02,876
Sahara-san? Our classmate of the elementary school?

734
00:54:09,459 --> 00:54:11,292
Ya-sho, Ya-sho!

735
00:54:11,584 --> 00:54:12,584
Then?

736
00:54:12,667 --> 00:54:15,667
Are you going to look for Sahara-san?

737
00:54:16,125 --> 00:54:19,125
Don't be joking. I don't intend to be so.

738
00:54:19,459 --> 00:54:22,667
But I really think Kawai-san is very clever.

739
00:54:23,083 --> 00:54:25,584
Kawai-san...

740
00:54:26,542 --> 00:54:27,542
Ya-sho?

741
00:54:27,709 --> 00:54:28,918
But Mashiba-kun is also..

742
00:54:29,042 --> 00:54:30,375
Kawai-san...?

743
00:54:30,501 --> 00:54:32,584
What?

744
00:54:32,751 --> 00:54:34,167
I...I have

745
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:35,709
something to ask to you.

746
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:38,501
Do you know phone number or something to contact

747
00:54:38,626 --> 00:54:41,334
of Sahara-san, our classmate of the elementary school?

748
00:54:41,834 --> 00:54:43,459
Sahara-san?

749
00:54:43,667 --> 00:54:45,501
Sorry, I don't know...,

750
00:54:45,626 --> 00:54:48,167
But I know her school,

751
00:54:48,334 --> 00:54:50,042
as she belongs the same school as Nao-chan.

752
00:54:50,501 --> 00:54:53,167
Taiyo female high school...

753
00:54:54,167 --> 00:54:55,709
Oops, my money is not enough.

754
00:54:55,876 --> 00:54:56,959
Ishida-kun.

755
00:54:57,125 --> 00:54:58,626
Use this.

756
00:54:58,918 --> 00:55:01,667
What!? I don't need that much!

757
00:55:01,792 --> 00:55:03,876
Don't mind, Ya-sho.

758
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,209
When you need travel, meal, and then love hotel expenses,

759
00:55:07,334 --> 00:55:10,083
You will be safe to have that much.

760
00:55:10,209 --> 00:55:11,375
Hey!

761
00:55:11,792 --> 00:55:13,501
We are here!

762
00:55:15,209 --> 00:55:16,542
My sis says

763
00:55:16,667 --> 00:55:20,375
she pisses you as you're looking for a past classmate without her.

764
00:55:20,501 --> 00:55:23,167
So take her with you, Ishida.

765
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Title: Are you tired?

766
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,375
"I got your address from Yuzuru. Thank you for today."

767
00:55:51,542 --> 00:55:59,792
"I'm glad to hear that you are looking for Sahara-san!"

768
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,417
"I have heard various news about you from Yuzuru."

769
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,209
"I'm pleased to go together today!"

770
00:56:18,501 --> 00:56:19,626
"Taiyo Female High School"

771
00:56:22,501 --> 00:56:25,209
Well...

772
00:56:25,667 --> 00:56:27,834
Walking from here and...

773
00:56:29,792 --> 00:56:31,375
Sho-chan?

774
00:56:31,501 --> 00:56:33,167
Sorry.

775
00:56:33,292 --> 00:56:34,417
Sho-chan!

776
00:56:35,834 --> 00:56:38,667
I'm Sahara!

777
00:56:38,876 --> 00:56:40,459
Do you remember me?

778
00:56:41,209 --> 00:56:42,918
Hello!

779
00:56:43,042 --> 00:56:45,125
Huh? Ishida-kun?

780
00:56:48,167 --> 00:56:50,167
Long time no see.

781
00:56:52,042 --> 00:56:53,459
{\an8}<i>SL: Long time no see.</i>

782
00:56:55,042 --> 00:56:58,584
I've continued to study sign language after that.

783
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:00,667
Is this correct?

784
00:57:01,792 --> 00:57:04,250
I disappeared when we were in the elementary school...

785
00:57:06,918 --> 00:57:08,083
I'm sorry.

786
00:57:08,667 --> 00:57:12,334
I have been thinking of Sho-chan for long time.

787
00:57:13,292 --> 00:57:15,667
I'm happy to see you again.

788
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,334
And I'm surprised.

789
00:57:17,334 --> 00:57:20,584
{\an8}<i>SL: Me too.</i>

790
00:57:24,125 --> 00:57:25,334
Oh, really?

791
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Huh, and now,

792
00:57:29,167 --> 00:57:33,292
What kind of school you are going to?

793
00:57:35,334 --> 00:57:36,334
I see.

794
00:57:36,459 --> 00:57:38,667
And, hey, your chest got big, you know.

795
00:57:38,792 --> 00:57:39,792
What's your cup size?

796
00:57:40,083 --> 00:57:41,125
I'll check for myself!

797
00:57:45,459 --> 00:57:47,834
Where are you going?

798
00:57:47,959 --> 00:57:50,584
A restroom.

799
00:57:50,751 --> 00:57:52,542
I see.

800
00:57:56,167 --> 00:58:00,000
Hello! We handing out a discount coupon for you!

801
00:58:00,167 --> 00:58:02,417
Discount coupon!

802
00:58:10,167 --> 00:58:12,209
Ueno...

803
00:58:12,792 --> 00:58:13,959
Discount coupon!

804
00:58:14,083 --> 00:58:16,250
Here it is.

805
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:25,417
"Mew mew club"...

806
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
From: Sahara-san

807
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,626
You are great that you learned sign language.

808
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
And thank you for bringing us together!

809
00:58:38,834 --> 00:58:41,042
Sahara is so aggressive.

810
00:58:41,959 --> 00:58:43,751
I cannot behave like her...

811
00:58:45,667 --> 00:58:48,584
Can I bring Ueno together, too?

812
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:52,042
Huh? Naturally impossible, you know?

813
00:58:54,083 --> 00:58:56,125
I think so, too.

814
00:59:01,417 --> 00:59:02,626
Well...

815
00:59:02,751 --> 00:59:04,542
Let's go, Nagatsuka-kun.

816
00:59:04,667 --> 00:59:06,876
Now is the time to "Mew mew club"!

817
00:59:07,375 --> 00:59:09,417
Can I help you?

818
00:59:09,959 --> 00:59:11,542
How long are you going to stay?

819
00:59:11,918 --> 00:59:13,375
One hour, please.

820
00:59:14,292 --> 00:59:16,417
Can we use this coupon?

821
00:59:16,542 --> 00:59:19,000
Yes, you can.

822
00:59:19,292 --> 00:59:21,918
Oh, unbelievable. He actually comes...

823
00:59:23,209 --> 00:59:24,918
Well, how should I say, but...

824
00:59:26,918 --> 00:59:29,292
What in the world did you expect?

825
00:59:29,417 --> 00:59:31,125
S...so did you?

826
00:59:31,292 --> 00:59:33,417
Don't say stupid things to me.

827
00:59:33,542 --> 00:59:37,083
I was simply interested in your old friend.

828
00:59:37,209 --> 00:59:39,292
Yes, your old friend...

829
00:59:39,667 --> 00:59:41,083
Is she here?

830
00:59:41,292 --> 00:59:43,751
Actually, not a friend.

831
00:59:44,292 --> 00:59:45,375
Then what?

832
00:59:45,501 --> 00:59:47,918
A little complicated.

833
00:59:48,417 --> 00:59:50,417
There were something in the elementary school time.

834
00:59:53,542 --> 00:59:54,834
She seems not here today.

835
00:59:59,042 --> 01:00:00,751
Let's go home then.

836
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
"Hearing Test Room"

837
01:00:15,334 --> 01:00:16,334
An insect!

838
01:00:17,417 --> 01:00:18,792
Hi, you were here.

839
01:00:19,501 --> 01:00:21,626
Came to play with Maria.

840
01:00:22,042 --> 01:00:24,959
By the way, will Nishimiya be pleased if I give this pouch?

841
01:00:27,334 --> 01:00:28,626
A cat!

842
01:00:30,542 --> 01:00:32,125
Sis, I've got something for you!

843
01:00:47,501 --> 01:00:48,959
...Sis?

844
01:00:52,709 --> 01:00:54,667
I'll put some present for you here.

845
01:01:03,959 --> 01:01:04,959
U--Ueno...

846
01:01:05,042 --> 01:01:06,959
...san?

847
01:01:07,125 --> 01:01:08,209
Go, go!

848
01:01:08,459 --> 01:01:10,542
Wait, wait, what!?

849
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:11,667
Long time no see!

850
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:14,417
Yeah. Long time no see.

851
01:01:20,125 --> 01:01:22,250
Huh? The girl over there is Nishimiya, isn't she?

852
01:01:23,417 --> 01:01:25,417
She seems still alone, haha.

853
01:01:25,959 --> 01:01:27,584
Too poor!

854
01:01:28,834 --> 01:01:31,292
Ishida! It's really a long time not seeing you.

855
01:01:31,417 --> 01:01:32,918
Let's hang out together shortly.

856
01:01:33,042 --> 01:01:35,042
No thank you.

857
01:01:35,167 --> 01:01:37,709
Ishida, you hate me, don't you?

858
01:01:37,834 --> 01:01:40,584
I don't know.

859
01:01:42,167 --> 01:01:43,501
Actually,

860
01:01:43,626 --> 01:01:46,459
I have been thinking

861
01:01:46,584 --> 01:01:48,250
I should have talk earlier.

862
01:01:48,751 --> 01:01:51,375
I'm sorry when we were in the elementary school.

863
01:01:53,709 --> 01:01:55,876
Ueno, get off my bike.

864
01:02:01,501 --> 01:02:04,709
Why she has a pouch of the cat cafe I'm working in?

865
01:02:05,125 --> 01:02:07,542
Why? So weird!

866
01:02:08,042 --> 01:02:09,542
I gave it to her.

867
01:02:09,667 --> 01:02:11,751
Oh...I see.

868
01:02:16,501 --> 01:02:17,584
Good-bye.

869
01:02:17,834 --> 01:02:18,918
Bye.

870
01:02:23,167 --> 01:02:24,167
Ueno?

871
01:02:25,083 --> 01:02:28,584
Nishimiya-san, long time no see! How have you been?

872
01:02:28,709 --> 01:02:29,709
H..hey!!

873
01:02:30,209 --> 01:02:32,083
Huh? Why you wear only one?

874
01:02:32,375 --> 01:02:34,417
Ueno! What are you doing!?

875
01:02:36,209 --> 01:02:38,959
Throwing away to play, as we did in the past.

876
01:02:45,375 --> 01:02:46,918
Sorry, Nishimiya.

877
01:02:48,959 --> 01:02:51,959
Are you joking, Ishida?

878
01:02:52,083 --> 01:02:53,959
Wait! Let us wait a moment!

879
01:02:54,083 --> 01:02:56,667
You two are going together?

880
01:02:57,167 --> 01:02:58,959
No, not like that.

881
01:02:59,083 --> 01:03:00,626
Just friends.

882
01:03:00,751 --> 01:03:02,167
Friends?

883
01:03:02,292 --> 01:03:03,876
Don't make me laugh!

884
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,918
You are friends with a girl who you bullied?

885
01:03:06,042 --> 01:03:07,292
Why?

886
01:03:07,417 --> 01:03:10,292
I cannot follow you!

887
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,918
Oh, understand. A kind of sense of guilt?

888
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:16,375
No.

889
01:03:18,375 --> 01:03:20,918
Ishida, you have became a so boring guy.

890
01:03:23,918 --> 01:03:27,667
Now I don't stop you two playing friends!

891
01:03:35,042 --> 01:03:36,667
"What did you talk about?"

892
01:03:37,125 --> 01:03:38,375
N--Nothing special.

893
01:03:39,584 --> 01:03:42,167
Well, I have to go now.

894
01:03:43,375 --> 01:03:44,375
See you again.

895
01:04:06,167 --> 01:04:07,417
Yuju,

01:04:09,751 --> 01:04:10,834

01:04:11,125 --> 01:04:13,334
I'm quite awake. So surprised.

Bregbazt, lez eed now.

01:04:15,083 --> 01:04:17,000
Wait, wait, before that..

900
01:04:17,501 --> 01:04:18,626
What's happened?

901
01:04:20,667 --> 01:04:22,083
Sis.

902
01:04:22,834 --> 01:04:25,501
Ponytail today? Why?

903
01:04:27,209 --> 01:04:29,584
What a weird face!

904
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,918
Then make Ishida have a chance to see her!

905
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,626
"So many carp. More bread needed."

906
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:41,042
"You MUST come."

907
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:52,250
Nishimiya...

908
01:04:52,876 --> 01:04:54,459
Ponytail!?

909
01:05:09,209 --> 01:05:11,709
Whea are yu goig, Ijida-gun?

910
01:05:12,209 --> 01:05:14,667
"Where are you going?"

911
01:05:16,334 --> 01:05:17,667
I'm going to a bread shop.

912
01:05:18,042 --> 01:05:20,626
Yuzuru asked to buy a bread for feeding carp.

913
01:05:21,209 --> 01:05:24,792
Yuju muzt habe id. Yuju only wand do ead bi herzelb.

914
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,417
Hey, Nishimiya!

Ijida-gun, don'd need do go

916
01:05:28,626 --> 01:05:29,626
Wait. Sign language! Sign language!

Yes.

919
01:05:37,834 --> 01:05:39,375
Oh, sorry.

920
01:05:41,626 --> 01:05:44,292
It's completely okay.

921
01:05:44,584 --> 01:05:47,626
W--well, I have to go now. Bread.

922
01:05:48,667 --> 01:05:50,000
Then bye.

923
01:05:56,334 --> 01:05:57,334
Nishimiya?

924
01:06:05,751 --> 01:06:08,000
Huh? You give this?

925
01:06:08,501 --> 01:06:09,626
Thanks.

926
01:06:12,501 --> 01:06:13,667
Can I open it here?

927
01:06:16,292 --> 01:06:17,792
...What are these?

928
01:06:21,626 --> 01:06:22,834
Thank you very much.

929
01:06:27,334 --> 01:06:28,751
...ige...oo...

930
01:06:29,501 --> 01:06:30,501
What?

931
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:32,375
About these?

932
01:06:34,209 --> 01:06:36,209
I...ige...moo...

933
01:06:42,209 --> 01:06:43,042
Huh?...

934
01:06:46,876 --> 01:06:49,167
I lige moo!

935
01:06:58,292 --> 01:06:59,626
Moon?

936
01:07:00,417 --> 01:07:01,417
Yeah.

937
01:07:02,667 --> 01:07:03,876
It's beautiful.

938
01:07:09,918 --> 01:07:11,459
Ni...Nishimiya!?

939
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
"From: Big friend Nagatsuka"

940
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,959
"How about watching a movie from now?"

941
01:07:20,292 --> 01:07:21,542
Hey Nagatsuka-kun,

942
01:07:22,083 --> 01:07:23,834
Can you see this as a moon?

943
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Huh? I cannot see that as a moon.

944
01:07:28,959 --> 01:07:29,834
C--Candy?

945
01:07:29,959 --> 01:07:32,000
These are not candies.

946
01:07:32,584 --> 01:07:35,375
Nishimiya gave them just now,

947
01:07:35,501 --> 01:07:37,209
but I'm not sure what they are.

948
01:07:43,751 --> 01:07:45,292
What's the matter, sis?

949
01:07:48,209 --> 01:07:49,584
"I said Ishida-kun that I like him."

950
01:07:49,626 --> 01:07:50,876
Oh, really!?

951
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,417
"But he didn't understand what I said."

952
01:08:03,042 --> 01:08:05,334
Wow, you have changed your hairstyle.

953
01:08:05,459 --> 01:08:08,042
Why changed? What happened?

954
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:10,417
It matches you so much!

955
01:08:12,083 --> 01:08:15,167
Stop, stop you all.

956
01:08:15,375 --> 01:08:17,959
I was in a bit of rush this morning, that's all.

957
01:08:18,209 --> 01:08:20,751
But that looks great anyway.

958
01:08:20,876 --> 01:08:22,667
Hi, Kawai-san.

959
01:08:23,083 --> 01:08:24,918
Why you have changed your hairstyle?

960
01:08:27,876 --> 01:08:30,334
I don't have any special reason to do it.

961
01:08:30,667 --> 01:08:31,667
I see.

962
01:08:31,751 --> 01:08:34,584
That's what girls do, you know?

963
01:08:34,959 --> 01:08:35,959
Okay.

964
01:08:36,834 --> 01:08:38,334
What?

965
01:08:38,459 --> 01:08:40,501
By the way, Mashiba-kun

966
01:08:40,626 --> 01:08:43,876
said he wants to be friends with you.

967
01:08:52,709 --> 01:08:54,667
Why...why you are here today.

968
01:08:55,083 --> 01:08:57,250
I'm Sahara, nice to meet you.

969
01:08:57,417 --> 01:08:58,959
Me too. I'm Mashiba.

970
01:08:59,083 --> 01:09:01,542
Hey! Stop doing that over my head!

971
01:09:01,667 --> 01:09:03,959
Miyo-chan, long time no see.

972
01:09:04,083 --> 01:09:06,125
By the way, where is Nishimiya today?

973
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:07,876
Sis went home as she had a stomachache.

974
01:09:09,292 --> 01:09:11,751
I wonder she may be avoiding me...?

975
01:09:11,959 --> 01:09:12,959
Why do you think so?

976
01:09:13,125 --> 01:09:14,209
The other day,

977
01:09:14,334 --> 01:09:16,334
She was trying hard to tell me something,

978
01:09:16,459 --> 01:09:18,209
but I couldn't understand what she said.

979
01:09:18,334 --> 01:09:20,167
Huh, what did sis tried to tell?

980
01:09:21,042 --> 01:09:21,709
Moon.

981
01:09:22,709 --> 01:09:26,125
I couldn't understand very simple words she told.

982
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:28,792
I guess that would make her mad.

983
01:09:28,918 --> 01:09:31,250
If you want to know if sis is avoiding you or not,

984
01:09:31,375 --> 01:09:32,959
why don't you invite her playing something?

985
01:09:33,459 --> 01:09:34,792
If she is still angry, she will say no.

986
01:09:36,292 --> 01:09:37,792
That's a good idea.

987
01:09:41,417 --> 01:09:42,709
(From: Ishida) We plan to hang out somewhere,

988
01:09:42,709 --> 01:09:44,709
so how about going together?

989
01:09:59,626 --> 01:10:01,918
Hi all, let's start with that roller coaster!

990
01:10:02,042 --> 01:10:03,584
Follow me so that you don't lost!

991
01:10:04,167 --> 01:10:06,083
Hey, why is that girl leading us?

992
01:10:06,209 --> 01:10:07,334
I don't know.

993
01:10:07,584 --> 01:10:09,292
Ishida.

994
01:10:09,584 --> 01:10:11,000
Who's that girl?

995
01:10:12,292 --> 01:10:14,667
She seems too familiar with sis.

996
01:10:15,292 --> 01:10:17,334
Ueno... Why...

997
01:10:18,876 --> 01:10:20,501
Is she Shoko's acquaintaince?

998
01:10:20,667 --> 01:10:22,250
Y--yes,

999
01:10:22,375 --> 01:10:24,125
when we were in the elementary school.

1000
01:10:30,709 --> 01:10:32,209
Can I sit next to you, Sahara-san?

1001
01:10:32,584 --> 01:10:33,709
Yeah, of course.

1002
01:10:38,417 --> 01:10:40,459
Are you all ready?

1003
01:10:40,751 --> 01:10:41,918
Yeah!!

1004
01:10:42,334 --> 01:10:43,876
Then let's start.

1005
01:10:46,167 --> 01:10:49,918
Sahara-san, are you okay to be with Ueno?

1006
01:10:51,083 --> 01:10:52,083
Yes.

1007
01:10:52,167 --> 01:10:54,876
I'm in the same class of the same high school with her now.

1008
01:10:55,667 --> 01:10:59,042
I'm learning a lot from her taste and skills.

1009
01:11:01,042 --> 01:11:05,125
I'd been scared to ride when I was in elementary school.

1010
01:11:05,375 --> 01:11:06,792
I was a coward at that time.

1011
01:11:09,334 --> 01:11:12,292
But I changed my way a bit.

1012
01:11:13,667 --> 01:11:17,292
I'd ride first, then I see if it scares me or not.

1013
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:22,000
Honestly, I'm still scared a bit.

1014
01:11:23,125 --> 01:11:25,000
Hey, it comes!

1015
01:11:45,584 --> 01:11:47,626
Hey, are you okay?

1016
01:11:48,125 --> 01:11:49,959
Your legs are so trembling, Sho-chan.

1017
01:11:51,751 --> 01:11:53,667
"Are you okay?"

1018
01:11:55,959 --> 01:11:58,876
You are fantastic as you can use sign language!

1019
01:11:59,167 --> 01:12:01,667
You did your best to learn sign language, Ishida-kun!

1020
01:12:04,751 --> 01:12:06,959
{\an8}<i>SL: Fun!</i>

1021
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,709
Hey, is this hand yours?

1022
01:12:09,209 --> 01:12:11,083
You are so rude to my best friend Ya-sho!

1023
01:12:11,209 --> 01:12:13,626
Huh? I simply want to be friends with him.

1024
01:12:13,751 --> 01:12:15,417
No, don't act like a child!

1025
01:12:15,542 --> 01:12:17,792
Nagatsuka-kun, you're so funny!

1026
01:12:18,209 --> 01:12:21,000
My permission is needed when you speak to Ya-sho!

1027
01:12:21,125 --> 01:12:23,501
Nagatsuka-kun, is your hair natural one?

1028
01:12:23,626 --> 01:12:26,042
What!? Don't be silly!

1029
01:12:26,209 --> 01:12:28,250
Hey! Stop touching my hair!

1030
01:12:28,375 --> 01:12:29,375
Wait...

1031
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Mashiba-kun, go away faster!

1032
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:34,209
Go, go, Ya-sho, go!

1033
01:12:34,542 --> 01:12:35,375
Wait...

1034
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,375
Can I...?

1035
01:12:38,501 --> 01:12:40,876
Can I enjoy like this?

1036
01:12:41,792 --> 01:12:44,792
But it seems like that...

1037
01:12:45,834 --> 01:12:47,501
What are you doing?!

1038
01:12:47,792 --> 01:12:50,501
It seems like...

1039
01:12:50,918 --> 01:12:52,417
Friends!

1040
01:12:58,250 --> 01:12:59,876
Ishida.

1041
01:13:00,375 --> 01:13:02,375
I want to eat takoyaki snacks.

1042
01:13:02,792 --> 01:13:04,000
Let go to buy together.

1043
01:13:04,125 --> 01:13:06,209
What!? Hey!

1044
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,125
Here's takoyaki. Thank you for buying.

1045
01:13:10,876 --> 01:13:11,876
Thank you very much.

1046
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,209
Hey you, Ueno,

1047
01:13:13,626 --> 01:13:15,876
I don't want such unnecessary kindness.

1048
01:13:24,042 --> 01:13:26,501
Shi...Shimada...

1049
01:13:31,792 --> 01:13:33,792
Hey, Ishida!

1050
01:13:36,167 --> 01:13:38,000
Sorry, but I'll text you later.

1051
01:13:39,959 --> 01:13:41,125
Ishida!

1052
01:13:41,918 --> 01:13:43,167
You got angry?

1053
01:13:43,417 --> 01:13:44,542
No. I'm not angry.

1054
01:13:45,459 --> 01:13:47,375
Being angry -- No.

1055
01:13:47,501 --> 01:13:48,501
I just thought--

1056
01:13:48,834 --> 01:13:50,709
if you two meet again,

1057
01:13:50,834 --> 01:13:53,959
you could be friends again.

1058
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:57,834
Things might go well if you two meet again.

1059
01:13:58,292 --> 01:14:00,292
Don't do such misplaced kindness.

1060
01:14:05,959 --> 01:14:08,542
I did the same things to them...

1061
01:14:13,334 --> 01:14:15,626
You and me are alike, huh?

1062
01:14:15,792 --> 01:14:16,792
No. we are not.

1063
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:18,459
We are alike.

1064
01:14:18,834 --> 01:14:20,334
We are not.

1065
01:14:24,083 --> 01:14:25,083
Well.

1066
01:14:25,209 --> 01:14:28,542
If Nishimiya-san hadn't come, we all would have been happy.

1067
01:14:30,334 --> 01:14:31,876
Don't jump to such a conclusion at your discretion.

1068
01:14:31,918 --> 01:14:33,542
But wasn't it correct?

1069
01:14:34,125 --> 01:14:35,792
If she had not be there,

1070
01:14:35,918 --> 01:14:38,959
I would not have a quarrel with Sahara, and,

1071
01:14:39,083 --> 01:14:42,584
friendship between you and Shimada wouldn't have been broken.

1072
01:14:43,083 --> 01:14:46,125
I wanna go back to the time before Nishimiya-san came.

1073
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:47,709
As for things with Shimada,

1074
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:50,876
I simply did so intentionally.

1075
01:14:52,042 --> 01:14:54,584
Ishida, you hate me?

1076
01:14:55,125 --> 01:14:56,375
Perhaps yes.

1077
01:14:58,042 --> 01:15:00,375
Now I feel like to ride the ferris wheel.

1078
01:15:00,667 --> 01:15:02,709
I wanna ride it with Nishimiya-san.

1079
01:15:02,834 --> 01:15:04,083
H--hey!

1080
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:08,542
Nishimiya-san, let's ride the ferris wheel together.

1081
01:15:08,667 --> 01:15:10,083
Hey, Ueno!

1082
01:15:10,250 --> 01:15:12,709
Sis, sorry but take this camera with you.

1083
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:15,501
I'm going to ride the roller coaster again.

1084
01:15:38,542 --> 01:15:41,000
Hi, you are welcome, Yuzuru-chan.

1085
01:15:41,125 --> 01:15:42,876
Shoya is in his room.

1086
01:15:44,250 --> 01:15:45,167
Hi.

1087
01:15:45,292 --> 01:15:47,042
I got a highly confidential movie.

1088
01:15:48,417 --> 01:15:49,792
A movie in the ferris wheel?

1089
01:15:50,292 --> 01:15:51,292
Yes.

1090
01:15:51,542 --> 01:15:53,334
Huh? What do you mean?

1091
01:15:53,667 --> 01:15:55,209
Peeping cam.

1092
01:16:00,167 --> 01:16:02,042
Well, I...

1093
01:16:02,667 --> 01:16:04,125
I hate you.

1094
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:09,959
Let's not use it.

1095
01:16:11,125 --> 01:16:13,792
I'll speak clearly so that you can understand, and

1096
01:16:13,918 --> 01:16:16,792
I'll carefully listen to what you say.

1097
01:16:18,042 --> 01:16:20,125
In the elementary school,

1098
01:16:20,584 --> 01:16:24,250
I didn't understand you enough.

1099
01:16:24,459 --> 01:16:29,042
But I think you didn't understand us, too.

1100
01:16:29,626 --> 01:16:33,292
That's why you bothered me with a weird notebook

1101
01:16:33,417 --> 01:16:35,751
and always smiled insincerely.

1102
01:16:35,876 --> 01:16:39,250
You always said sorry when something happened.

1103
01:16:40,042 --> 01:16:43,250
So I changed the way.

1104
01:16:43,375 --> 01:16:47,125
I ignored you and talked about you behind your back.

1105
01:16:47,375 --> 01:16:51,250
These were my message not to interfere us any more.

1106
01:16:51,667 --> 01:16:52,751
But,

1107
01:16:52,876 --> 01:16:56,250
you didn't understand it and got us back--

1108
01:16:56,375 --> 01:16:58,459
by ratting on us to adults.

1109
01:16:59,167 --> 01:17:02,167
As a result, Ishida lost his friends.

1110
01:17:02,667 --> 01:17:06,292
Lot of things around us were broken by you.

1111
01:17:08,709 --> 01:17:10,292
I...I'b zorry...

1112
01:17:10,417 --> 01:17:13,709
Actually, I don't want you to apologize.

1113
01:17:13,918 --> 01:17:16,334
Our views were very narrow in the childhood,

1114
01:17:16,459 --> 01:17:19,876
and we did our best within that limitation.

1115
01:17:20,042 --> 01:17:24,626
But I don't wanna say you let's be friends now.

1116
01:17:24,918 --> 01:17:27,417
I still hate you, and

1117
01:17:27,542 --> 01:17:29,501
you still hate me.

1118
01:17:30,209 --> 01:17:33,667
But how about being peaceful between us?

1119
01:17:33,876 --> 01:17:37,000
So let's shake hands, even each hate each.

1120
01:17:37,501 --> 01:17:40,000
Zat'z nod correcd...

1121
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:43,667
I hade myzelf...

1122
01:17:45,334 --> 01:17:46,334
So what?

1123
01:17:47,584 --> 01:17:49,250
What's that?

1124
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:54,667
Then?

1125
01:17:55,125 --> 01:17:57,459
You still say "I'm sorry"!?

1126
01:17:57,876 --> 01:17:59,125
After all,

1127
01:17:59,292 --> 01:18:02,918
you're shutting your mind talking with me, as you did 5 years ago.

1128
01:18:09,792 --> 01:18:11,167
How do you think about it?

1129
01:18:17,167 --> 01:18:18,626
I want Nishimiya

1130
01:18:19,209 --> 01:18:22,042
to like herself.

1131
01:18:30,918 --> 01:18:32,834
Ueno--san, right?

1132
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:34,709
Yeah. Ueno?

1133
01:18:35,334 --> 01:18:38,417
Did Nishimiya-san have some troubles with her?

1134
01:18:38,584 --> 01:18:40,250
Why do you think so?

1135
01:18:40,375 --> 01:18:44,167
Kawai-san said there had been something in the past.

1136
01:18:45,501 --> 01:18:47,042
By the way, I was surprised

1137
01:18:47,167 --> 01:18:49,834
Nishimiya-san was really unable to hear.

1138
01:18:50,792 --> 01:18:51,584
Yes, she is.

1139
01:18:51,709 --> 01:18:53,083
Oh, then, I guess,

1140
01:18:53,209 --> 01:18:56,167
she was bullied because of that?

1141
01:18:57,792 --> 01:19:00,167
I cannot forgive

1142
01:19:00,584 --> 01:19:01,709
that kind of bully.

1143
01:19:02,250 --> 01:19:03,959
Don't you think so, Ishida-kun?

1144
01:19:04,751 --> 01:19:06,375
What do you mean!?

1145
01:19:06,834 --> 01:19:09,501
You say I am spreading what you did in the past!?

1146
01:19:09,626 --> 01:19:11,959
Hey, you're speaking too loudly...

1147
01:19:14,042 --> 01:19:16,751
After all, Ishida-kun hasn't changed at all from the past!

1148
01:19:16,876 --> 01:19:17,542
What!?

1149
01:19:17,667 --> 01:19:19,751
You've always told me cruel things since the elementary school!

1150
01:19:19,876 --> 01:19:21,042
What's the matter, Ya-sho?

1151
01:19:21,167 --> 01:19:22,792
Calm down, Kawai-san.

1152
01:19:23,209 --> 01:19:24,209
What are you talking about?

1153
01:19:24,667 --> 01:19:26,834
Mashiba-kun!

1154
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,959
Ishida-kun used to bully a girl in the past.

1155
01:19:32,459 --> 01:19:34,667
What are you saying, Kawai-san?

1156
01:19:35,083 --> 01:19:36,209
Don't be silly..

1157
01:19:36,334 --> 01:19:37,459
It's true!

1158
01:19:38,292 --> 01:19:41,459
Kawai-san also said bad things at that time...

1159
01:19:42,042 --> 01:19:45,083
I never said bad things to Nishimiya-san!

1160
01:19:45,209 --> 01:19:46,834
What!? Nishimiya-san!?

1161
01:19:46,959 --> 01:19:47,751
Yes.

1162
01:19:47,876 --> 01:19:50,709
Ishida-kun bullied Nishimiya-san!

1163
01:19:52,918 --> 01:19:56,334
I asked him please to stop doing that,

1164
01:19:57,209 --> 01:19:59,834
but he never listened to what I said.

1165
01:20:00,375 --> 01:20:01,959
He scared me so much...

1166
01:20:04,334 --> 01:20:05,083
Ya-sho?

1167
01:20:06,125 --> 01:20:07,417
Are you okay?

1168
01:20:07,542 --> 01:20:09,334
Sorry, Nagatsuka-kun..

1169
01:20:09,459 --> 01:20:10,501
Ya-sho...

1170
01:20:12,584 --> 01:20:13,792
Ya-sho!

1171
01:20:42,459 --> 01:20:45,083
I hate myself, too...

1172
01:20:56,626 --> 01:20:58,375
Hi, Ishida.

1173
01:20:58,501 --> 01:20:59,209
Hi!

1174
01:21:01,459 --> 01:21:02,918
What's wrong?

1175
01:21:02,751 --> 01:21:04,292
{\an8}<i>SL: Are you all right?</i>

1176
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,918
No, nothing special.

1177
01:21:06,167 --> 01:21:07,709
Nothing...

1178
01:21:09,834 --> 01:21:11,501
Hey, Ishida-kun, you are here!

1179
01:21:11,918 --> 01:21:13,959
I'm bringing your bag here!

1180
01:21:14,209 --> 01:21:14,876
Hey.

1181
01:21:15,042 --> 01:21:16,209
Nao-chan..

1182
01:21:17,209 --> 01:21:18,876
...I asked her to come.

1183
01:21:22,792 --> 01:21:24,584
I'm sorry in the classroom, Ishida-kun.

1184
01:21:25,417 --> 01:21:26,501
But,

1185
01:21:26,834 --> 01:21:30,042
originally you are to blamed.

1186
01:21:30,959 --> 01:21:32,375
But,

1187
01:21:31,375 --> 01:21:32,876
{\an8}<i>SL: What's going on?</i>

1188
01:21:32,626 --> 01:21:34,709
if Ishida-kun apologize to Nishimiya-san,

1189
01:21:34,834 --> 01:21:36,542
then we can forgive you.

1190
01:21:36,709 --> 01:21:38,250
That's Mashiba-kun's idea, so...

1191
01:21:38,375 --> 01:21:39,584
Stop it.

1192
01:21:40,250 --> 01:21:42,250
That's not proper way.

1193
01:21:42,417 --> 01:21:46,083
We have no right to blame Ishida for this matter.

1194
01:21:47,417 --> 01:21:48,751
"We"?

1195
01:21:49,042 --> 01:21:50,501
That's not correct, Nao-chan.

1196
01:21:50,626 --> 01:21:51,792
What?

1197
01:21:52,375 --> 01:21:53,375
Different from me,

1198
01:21:53,501 --> 01:21:57,167
Nao-chan proactively bullied Nishimiya-san.

1199
01:21:57,375 --> 01:21:59,667
You should not treat me like yourself.

1200
01:22:00,834 --> 01:22:02,501
Nao-chan...

1201
01:22:02,834 --> 01:22:04,125
Yes.

1202
01:22:04,626 --> 01:22:06,209
You're right. We are different.

1203
01:22:06,667 --> 01:22:08,292
Completely different.

1204
01:22:08,417 --> 01:22:11,417
You were just looking on and laughed at her being bullied.

1205
01:22:12,125 --> 01:22:13,125
You're so awful!

1206
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:15,000
Hey, Sahara, how do you think about?

1207
01:22:15,125 --> 01:22:16,918
Me!?

1208
01:22:17,125 --> 01:22:20,167
Nao-chan also said so many bad things to Sahara-san.

1209
01:22:20,292 --> 01:22:22,459
I just said true things!

1210
01:22:23,792 --> 01:22:26,292
Hey, answer now, Sahara!

1211
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,167
I...I was..

1212
01:22:29,626 --> 01:22:31,292
at that time...

1213
01:22:31,751 --> 01:22:33,501
I was scared to both of you.

1214
01:22:33,626 --> 01:22:35,667
What!? Which side you are on!?

1215
01:22:35,834 --> 01:22:37,501
I'm not on any side of you!

1216
01:22:37,626 --> 01:22:38,792
Stop all.

1217
01:22:40,501 --> 01:22:43,501
It's all my fault.

1218
01:22:45,167 --> 01:22:47,250
I hate that kind of logic.

1219
01:22:48,167 --> 01:22:49,375
Stop, Ueno.

1220
01:22:50,209 --> 01:22:53,334
Don't conclude everything by yourself.

1221
01:22:54,417 --> 01:22:55,959
Ishida-kun, don't say things in such way...

1222
01:22:56,083 --> 01:22:57,584
Stop, Sahara.

1223
01:22:57,709 --> 01:22:59,626
You'll ran away after all like the past and regret,

1224
01:22:59,751 --> 01:23:01,334
and say "I was a coward".

1225
01:23:01,626 --> 01:23:03,334
What's wrong with you, Ishida-kun?

1226
01:23:03,626 --> 01:23:06,083
Stop speaking, Kawai.

1227
01:23:06,542 --> 01:23:09,417
You simply like yourself the most.

1228
01:23:10,501 --> 01:23:11,501
Ya-sho,

1229
01:23:11,626 --> 01:23:14,042
I'm always on you side...

1230
01:23:14,334 --> 01:23:18,000
Don't say such a thing not knowing me enough!

1231
01:23:18,918 --> 01:23:21,125
That's enough! I'm going home!

1232
01:23:22,375 --> 01:23:23,584
Ya-sho...

1233
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:28,709
It's all right. I don't mind at all.

1234
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:31,626
Sho-chan,

1235
01:23:32,626 --> 01:23:33,918
see you again.

1236
01:23:40,167 --> 01:23:41,834
Sorry, Ishida.

1237
01:23:43,042 --> 01:23:45,584
I regret to come here.

1238
01:23:48,501 --> 01:23:51,125
Ishida-kun, you were too terrible.

1239
01:23:52,876 --> 01:23:55,250
Don't be in touch, an outsider.

1240
01:23:56,918 --> 01:23:59,042
I had thought we became friends.

1241
01:24:11,375 --> 01:24:12,542
Oh, by the way,

1242
01:24:13,751 --> 01:24:15,167
from the next week,

1243
01:24:15,834 --> 01:24:17,542
summer holidays will start.

1244
01:24:18,083 --> 01:24:20,250
Why don't we hang out somewhere?

1245
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:41,083
Yuzu.

1246
01:24:41,501 --> 01:24:44,918
You'll hurt your eyes seeing something in such a dark place.

1247
01:24:50,626 --> 01:24:51,792
Here.

1248
01:24:58,542 --> 01:25:02,000
Yuzu, you still worry about sis?

1249
01:25:04,751 --> 01:25:07,751
I'm worrying about you, Yuzuru.

1250
01:25:07,918 --> 01:25:09,709
You are always caring about your sis,

1251
01:25:09,834 --> 01:25:13,667
and don't caring about yourself.

1252
01:25:14,334 --> 01:25:16,125
Aren't you doing the same thing, gramma?

1253
01:25:16,626 --> 01:25:20,834
You don't join senior people groups and study sign language all the time.

1254
01:25:21,125 --> 01:25:24,667
That's just what I want to do.

1255
01:25:25,167 --> 01:25:28,542
Then so do I. I'm also doing so for myself.

1256
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:31,209
Really?

1257
01:25:34,709 --> 01:25:36,918
You're a very good granddaughter, Yuzu.

1258
01:25:37,209 --> 01:25:38,209
I don't think so.

1259
01:25:38,584 --> 01:25:41,334
I'm scolded everyday from mom,

1260
01:25:41,459 --> 01:25:43,334
and I've not gone to school for a while.

1261
01:25:43,918 --> 01:25:46,167
Yuzu have a very beautiful soul.

1262
01:25:47,125 --> 01:25:48,876
Shoko is also doing her best.

1263
01:25:51,292 --> 01:25:55,375
I'm proud of having very good granddaughters.

1264
01:25:58,834 --> 01:26:00,667
How about a sweet manju?

1265
01:26:00,792 --> 01:26:01,876
Yes, of course!

1266
01:26:07,250 --> 01:26:08,751
{\an8}<i>SL: I want to kill myself.</i>

1267
01:26:16,709 --> 01:26:17,709
Grandma...

1268
01:26:30,501 --> 01:26:32,375
Hi Nishimiya.

1269
01:26:32,834 --> 01:26:37,751
Today I got a very good bread.

1270
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,709
This bread is--

1271
01:26:41,709 --> 01:26:44,792
as wonderful as you,

1272
01:26:44,918 --> 01:26:46,417
so...

1273
01:26:47,584 --> 01:26:49,042
Hmmm, does it sound strange?

1274
01:26:52,709 --> 01:26:54,709
Nishimiya doesn't come today?

1275
01:26:57,626 --> 01:26:58,751
Well..

1276
01:26:59,292 --> 01:27:01,876
"Hi, Nishimiya, do you have a stomachache again today?"

1277
01:27:02,459 --> 01:27:03,667
Hmmm, this message is not good.

1278
01:27:13,375 --> 01:27:15,751
Hey, Yuzu...

1279
01:27:29,459 --> 01:27:30,459
I'll go home now...

1280
01:27:30,501 --> 01:27:31,542
Ishida.

1281
01:27:31,918 --> 01:27:33,125
Hey!

1282
01:27:33,876 --> 01:27:35,083
What is your outfit?

1283
01:27:35,209 --> 01:27:37,292
What? This is my school uniform.

1284
01:27:37,417 --> 01:27:38,918
How you feel, how you feel?!

1285
01:27:39,042 --> 01:27:40,042
Why?

1286
01:27:40,125 --> 01:27:42,459
School.

1287
01:27:42,751 --> 01:27:44,792
But it is in the summer vacation now.

1288
01:27:47,417 --> 01:27:49,083
What's actually wrong with you?

1289
01:27:51,417 --> 01:27:52,959
Nothing.

1290
01:27:53,083 --> 01:27:55,083
If I am to explain... a kind of cos-play?

1291
01:27:58,709 --> 01:28:01,375
A text from my sis. I have to go.

1292
01:28:01,501 --> 01:28:02,876
I'll take you. Where?

1293
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,125
No thank you.

1294
01:28:04,501 --> 01:28:05,501
I will.

1295
01:28:05,626 --> 01:28:07,334
I don't wanna you do so.

1296
01:28:07,834 --> 01:28:09,417
I saw you cried just now.

1297
01:28:10,417 --> 01:28:11,501
Why?

1298
01:28:13,709 --> 01:28:16,209
It's got nothing to do with you, Ishida.

1299
01:28:17,667 --> 01:28:19,083
Yes it is.

1300
01:28:19,751 --> 01:28:21,083
I want to think it is.

1301
01:28:21,209 --> 01:28:22,459
Why?

1302
01:28:22,876 --> 01:28:24,375
I'm worring about Yuzuru.

1303
01:28:26,501 --> 01:28:28,959
Don't say what my grandma would say...

1304
01:28:31,667 --> 01:28:33,542
Then I don't care if you follow me.

1305
01:28:37,209 --> 01:28:38,959
Thank you, Ishida.

1306
01:28:39,250 --> 01:28:42,125
It's enough here.

1307
01:28:42,792 --> 01:28:44,792
"Funeral for Ito Nishimiya"

1308
01:28:44,834 --> 01:28:46,000
Bye.

1309
01:28:51,876 --> 01:28:53,751
Hold out, Yuzuru!

1310
01:28:57,042 --> 01:28:58,250
Ishida.

1311
01:29:02,209 --> 01:29:03,792
I found myself still scared a bit.

1312
01:29:53,959 --> 01:29:56,292
{\an8}<i>SL: Grandma...</i>

1313
01:29:57,083 --> 01:29:58,792
{\an8}<i>SL: Yes, it must be grandma.</i>

1314
01:30:03,626 --> 01:30:06,959
(To: Nishimiya) How about hanging out somewhere tomorrow?

1315
01:30:32,250 --> 01:30:33,584
{\an8}<i>SL: It's refreshing.</i>

1316
01:30:59,334 --> 01:31:01,125
Oh, it's splendid.

1317
01:31:03,876 --> 01:31:05,667
Com'on, Nishimiya. Let's go over there.

1318
01:31:15,417 --> 01:31:16,667
Nishimiya?

1319
01:31:24,209 --> 01:31:26,501
Haha... I was a bit scared.

1320
01:31:27,584 --> 01:31:28,751
{\an8}<i>SL: I'm sorry.</i>

1321
01:31:28,709 --> 01:31:30,501
What? Why do you say sorry now?

1322
01:31:31,083 --> 01:31:35,584
{\an8}<i>SL: You'll be unhappy as far as you're with me.</i>

1323
01:31:37,292 --> 01:31:39,000
Don't say such a ridiculous thing!

1324
01:31:39,125 --> 01:31:40,792
Hey, Nishimiya, how about tomorrow?

1325
01:31:41,375 --> 01:31:42,417
Let's hang out tomorrow, too!

1326
01:31:42,542 --> 01:31:44,459
Hey, Nishimiya!

1327
01:31:48,125 --> 01:31:49,501
Nishimiya said that--

1328
01:31:49,626 --> 01:31:53,083
I'd be unhappy as far as I'm with her.

1329
01:31:54,834 --> 01:31:57,292
The person who made Nishimiya unhappy--

1330
01:31:57,792 --> 01:31:59,334
was I, actually...

1331
01:32:07,667 --> 01:32:12,125
I want to see the ocean,

1332
01:32:13,042 --> 01:32:17,542
I want to love humans,

1333
01:32:18,584 --> 01:32:22,292
even a monster has

1334
01:32:22,751 --> 01:32:27,042
a heart...

1335
01:32:28,667 --> 01:32:31,167
I cannot imagine how to recover the relationship...

1336
01:32:35,542 --> 01:32:38,667
Hey, Nishimiya! Yuzuru is here too today!

1337
01:32:38,834 --> 01:32:40,709
Then let's go to watch a movie!

1338
01:32:39,626 --> 01:32:40,626
{\an8}<i>SL: Hello.</i>

1339
01:32:40,834 --> 01:32:43,584
Hahaha, how funny it is!

1340
01:32:43,792 --> 01:32:44,375
{\an8}<i>SL: Hello.</i>

1341
01:32:44,083 --> 01:32:46,083
Hey, I'm here today!

1342
01:32:46,542 --> 01:32:49,751
What fruitful summer holidays we have this year!

1343
01:32:49,876 --> 01:32:50,876
Don't you agree with me, Yuzuru?

1344
01:32:50,918 --> 01:32:51,751
I don't know...

1345
01:32:51,876 --> 01:32:54,459
It's really full of enjoyment.

1346
01:32:54,584 --> 01:32:55,709
Hey, Nishimiya,

1347
01:32:55,834 --> 01:32:57,459
how about tomorrow?

1348
01:32:57,584 --> 01:32:59,125
Let's go out somewhere tomorrow, too!

1349
01:32:59,375 --> 01:33:02,167
We cannot go tomorrow, as we have a thing to do.

1350
01:33:02,459 --> 01:33:03,459
What?

1351
01:33:03,417 --> 01:33:04,709
{\an8}<i>SL: Let's make it together.</i>

1352
01:33:04,876 --> 01:33:07,000
Really!? Are you serious!?

1353
01:33:07,125 --> 01:33:08,125
What are you going to make?

1354
01:33:08,334 --> 01:33:09,375
I---is this okay?

1355
01:33:09,876 --> 01:33:11,876
Is it okay that I'm here?

1356
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Now that Ishida is assigned to help us--

1357
01:33:14,125 --> 01:33:16,667
to make a birthday cake for our mother.

1358
01:33:16,792 --> 01:33:17,792
Really?

1359
01:33:17,834 --> 01:33:19,417
I---is that okay?

1360
01:33:19,542 --> 01:33:21,250
Your mom will slap me again, won't she?

1361
01:33:21,375 --> 01:33:23,918
It might be even more. She may kill you.

1362
01:33:24,042 --> 01:33:25,250
Hey!

1363
01:33:25,751 --> 01:33:28,000
Oh, it looks delicious!

1364
01:33:30,667 --> 01:33:33,042
What? Why is this guy here?

1365
01:33:33,167 --> 01:33:35,167
Shoko, what do you intend to do?

1366
01:33:35,334 --> 01:33:37,417
Get out now...

1367
01:33:37,542 --> 01:33:40,209
Stop, mom! Today is your celebration day!

1368
01:33:40,334 --> 01:33:41,501
Yuzuru...

1369
01:33:41,667 --> 01:33:42,751
You looks good with this!

1370
01:33:50,125 --> 01:33:51,375
Tastes good!

1371
01:33:51,834 --> 01:33:54,459
Good for you Ishida, you didn't get killed.

1372
01:33:54,792 --> 01:33:55,918
Y--Yes.

1373
01:33:56,042 --> 01:33:57,792
Good for sis, too!

1374
01:33:57,959 --> 01:33:59,667
By the way, Yuzuru.

1375
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,501
I submitted some of your photos to the prefectural photo contest.

1376
01:34:03,626 --> 01:34:05,083
What?

1377
01:34:05,209 --> 01:34:07,292
Sho-chan wanted to submit for you.

1378
01:34:07,834 --> 01:34:10,918
{\an8}<i>SL: Mom selected the photo.</i>

1379
01:34:10,876 --> 01:34:13,751
But I suppose all the photos are kind of creepy.

1380
01:34:13,876 --> 01:34:15,667
Not necessarily so.

1381
01:34:16,542 --> 01:34:18,125
Hey, you two did so without asking me!

1382
01:34:20,042 --> 01:34:23,959
By the way, there'll be a fireworks festival next Tuesday.

1383
01:34:24,292 --> 01:34:26,709
{\an8}<i>SL: Let's go together.</i>

1384
01:34:26,542 --> 01:34:27,876
Hmmm, I'd like to pass.

1385
01:34:28,042 --> 01:34:29,876
Hey, let's go together.

1386
01:34:42,584 --> 01:34:44,667
Is it okay here?

1387
01:35:13,626 --> 01:35:16,375
Well, I'll go to buy fried noodles.

1388
01:35:16,542 --> 01:35:17,709
Let's go together.

1389
01:35:29,834 --> 01:35:31,083
Oh, thank you.

1390
01:35:31,501 --> 01:35:35,459
Well, thank you for inviting me to your apartment the other day.

1391
01:35:35,584 --> 01:35:36,626
Your mom...

1392
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,000
{\an8}<i>SL: It was fun.</i>

1393
01:35:37,834 --> 01:35:39,834
Did she enjoy the party?

1394
01:35:39,959 --> 01:35:41,709
Basically she had no facial expressions, but...

1395
01:35:42,459 --> 01:35:46,042
What day is your birthday, Nishimiya?

1396
01:35:47,792 --> 01:35:48,876
June...

1397
01:35:49,042 --> 01:35:50,042
7th.

1398
01:35:50,125 --> 01:35:52,375
Oh, it's already passed!

1399
01:35:52,501 --> 01:35:53,501
Then,

1400
01:35:53,626 --> 01:35:56,334
Nishimiya is 18 years old already.

1401
01:35:56,667 --> 01:36:00,584
Next year, let's celebrate your birthday together.

1402
01:36:00,709 --> 01:36:01,542
Oops,

1403
01:36:01,667 --> 01:36:03,334
I said "together" unintentionally...

1404
01:36:24,501 --> 01:36:27,083
{\an8}<i>SL: I'm feeling it by the body, instead of ear.</i>

1405
01:36:26,584 --> 01:36:28,834
I see.

1406
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,292
Understood.

1407
01:36:30,667 --> 01:36:33,042
It's interesting.

1408
01:36:34,834 --> 01:36:37,000
Oh, what's up?

1409
01:36:38,083 --> 01:36:39,834
{\an8}<i>SL: I'll be going.</i>

1410
01:36:40,918 --> 01:36:44,792
But fireworks are not over yet...

1411
01:36:47,417 --> 01:36:48,792
"To study"...

1412
01:36:49,792 --> 01:36:50,959
I see.

1413
01:36:51,417 --> 01:36:53,792
Then I'll go with you.

1414
01:36:54,125 --> 01:36:55,125
{\an8}<i>SL: No, I'm okay.</i>

1415
01:36:55,167 --> 01:36:56,501
But...

1416
01:36:59,667 --> 01:37:01,292
{\an8}<i>SL: I'm okay.</i>

1417
01:37:02,542 --> 01:37:03,542
I see.

1418
01:37:03,667 --> 01:37:05,292
See you again.

1419
01:37:08,709 --> 01:37:10,334
{\an8}<i>SL: Thank you.</i>

1420
01:37:15,626 --> 01:37:18,584
Huh? what happened to sis?

1421
01:37:19,417 --> 01:37:20,918
By the way, Ishida,

1422
01:37:21,042 --> 01:37:23,167
can you go to our apartment to pick up my camera?

1423
01:37:36,834 --> 01:37:39,042
Good evening..

1424
01:37:39,167 --> 01:37:40,459
Oh, it's dark.

1425
01:37:40,792 --> 01:37:43,876
Nishimiya, I'm here...

1426
01:37:44,542 --> 01:37:46,209
Here it is.

1427
01:37:46,584 --> 01:37:49,709
Is it charged?

1428
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,250
Oh, we can see fireworks from here.

1429
01:37:53,792 --> 01:37:56,209
You are here, Nishimiya.

1430
01:37:56,375 --> 01:37:58,751
Hi, Nishimi...ya...

1431
01:37:59,751 --> 01:38:00,751
Nishimiya?

1432
01:38:01,459 --> 01:38:03,167
Wait! Wait a moment!

1433
01:38:03,918 --> 01:38:04,918
What are you doing?!

1434
01:38:05,042 --> 01:38:06,042
Nishimiya?

1435
01:38:10,083 --> 01:38:11,083
Nishimiya!

1436
01:38:23,042 --> 01:38:23,834
Nishimiya!

1437
01:38:30,792 --> 01:38:31,959
Nishimiya!

1438
01:38:34,417 --> 01:38:35,876
Shoko!

1439
01:38:59,792 --> 01:39:00,918
Why...

1440
01:39:01,250 --> 01:39:02,792
Why, Nishimiya...

1441
01:39:07,834 --> 01:39:08,834
Nishimiya, rails!

1442
01:39:08,959 --> 01:39:10,959
Grip the rails!

1443
01:39:11,125 --> 01:39:12,584
Please, God...

1444
01:39:13,292 --> 01:39:17,042
Give me just one more ounce of strength.

1445
01:39:18,167 --> 01:39:20,834
I won't run away from what I hate.

1446
01:39:21,876 --> 01:39:23,167
Starting tomorrow,

1447
01:39:23,667 --> 01:39:26,501
I'll look at everyone's face.

1448
01:39:26,709 --> 01:39:30,459
Starting tomorrow, I'll listen to everyone's voice.

1449
01:39:31,626 --> 01:39:34,626
Starting tomorrow, I'll do everything properly...

1450
01:39:35,542 --> 01:39:37,626
Ni...Nishimiya..

1451
01:39:39,542 --> 01:39:42,626
Oh, a scar I made in the past...

1452
01:39:43,751 --> 01:39:46,209
Did I properly apologize for that?

1453
01:39:47,292 --> 01:39:48,375
Sorry.

1454
01:39:48,751 --> 01:39:50,792
I'm sorry, Nishimiya.

1455
01:39:51,042 --> 01:39:52,626
Are you still mad?

1456
01:39:53,042 --> 01:39:55,375
Oh, I--

1457
01:39:56,042 --> 01:39:57,334
I should have ask Nishimiya--

1458
01:39:57,459 --> 01:40:00,834
how you really think of me...

1459
01:40:01,876 --> 01:40:05,000
By the way, you know, I---

1460
01:40:18,125 --> 01:40:19,209
Sho-chan,

1461
01:40:19,334 --> 01:40:22,250
Sis made pancakes for you.

1462
01:40:22,792 --> 01:40:24,876
Maria will go out to see fireworks!

1463
01:40:26,167 --> 01:40:27,167
{\an8}<i>SL: Friends.</i>

1464
01:40:37,375 --> 01:40:38,834
It's cold...

1465
01:40:39,667 --> 01:40:41,250
and warm...

1466
01:41:07,209 --> 01:41:08,375
Hi, ma'am.

1467
01:41:08,918 --> 01:41:10,834
Hi, Yuzuru-chan.

1468
01:41:11,542 --> 01:41:12,918
I finally saw you.

1469
01:41:13,250 --> 01:41:15,459
No one answered when I called to the salon, and

1470
01:41:15,584 --> 01:41:17,626
entering the room was prohibited...

1471
01:41:17,918 --> 01:41:20,626
Oh, that's okay now.

1472
01:41:20,792 --> 01:41:22,626
He changed rooms today.

1473
01:41:23,125 --> 01:41:26,250
Let's go to the room together, to see him.

1474
01:41:26,626 --> 01:41:28,209
Ma'am, well Shoko...

1475
01:41:28,334 --> 01:41:29,542
Ishida-san.

1476
01:41:30,375 --> 01:41:31,375
Nishimiya-san...

1477
01:41:33,167 --> 01:41:35,667
Nishimiya-san...I'm sorry.

1478
01:41:36,042 --> 01:41:39,250
Sorry again for troubling like this.

1479
01:41:40,334 --> 01:41:41,751
I'm very sorry.

1480
01:41:41,876 --> 01:41:42,876
Oh, please stop it.

1481
01:41:43,542 --> 01:41:46,542
My son must have done something wrong to Shoko-san, unless...

1482
01:41:46,667 --> 01:41:48,375
Ma'am.

1483
01:41:48,501 --> 01:41:51,959
Ishida saved my stupid sister.

1484
01:41:52,417 --> 01:41:54,667
I owe all the responsibility of mismanagement.

1485
01:41:55,292 --> 01:41:57,709
I'm very sorry, too.

1486
01:41:59,667 --> 01:42:00,667
Please...

1487
01:42:01,876 --> 01:42:04,042
Please raise your heads.

1488
01:42:04,209 --> 01:42:06,876
Nothing is better than that Shoko-san is okay, isn't it?

1489
01:42:07,209 --> 01:42:09,459
So do you, Yuzuru-chan.

1490
01:42:10,417 --> 01:42:12,375
Please...

1491
01:42:13,375 --> 01:42:16,542
Why in the world does Ishida have to be injured!

1492
01:42:17,584 --> 01:42:19,751
Don't pretend to be a tragedy heroine!

1493
01:42:21,042 --> 01:42:22,667
Say something!

1494
01:42:23,083 --> 01:42:27,417
"I made lots of troubles and bothered everyone, "

1495
01:42:27,584 --> 01:42:29,709
"so I'll apologize by killing myself."

1496
01:42:29,834 --> 01:42:31,834
"I'm very sorry." ??

1497
01:42:32,292 --> 01:42:34,459
How hubris you are!

1498
01:42:34,626 --> 01:42:35,626
Hey, Nishimiya!

1499
01:42:35,792 --> 01:42:37,709
You are totally a blight!

1500
01:42:38,167 --> 01:42:40,459
A bullshit like you, thinking everything--

1501
01:42:40,584 --> 01:42:42,584
from a single selfish point of view--

1502
01:42:42,709 --> 01:42:44,375
is the most annoying!

1503
01:42:49,209 --> 01:42:50,334
Ouch!

1504
01:42:50,459 --> 01:42:51,834
Who are you!

1505
01:42:55,626 --> 01:42:58,167
Oh, you must be Nishimiya's mother...

1506
01:42:58,542 --> 01:43:00,667
If you cannot bring up your child,

1507
01:43:00,792 --> 01:43:02,626
you shouldn't have had her in the first place!

1508
01:43:02,751 --> 01:43:03,751
What are you doing?!

1509
01:43:05,501 --> 01:43:06,792
Stop it.

1510
01:43:09,334 --> 01:43:10,542
Stop it!

1511
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Why?

1512
01:43:12,834 --> 01:43:14,042
What are you doing!

1513
01:43:26,292 --> 01:43:28,083
...Are you Shoko-san?

1514
01:43:31,292 --> 01:43:33,542
zorry.

1515
01:43:34,792 --> 01:43:36,209
I...I'b zorry.

1516
01:43:38,250 --> 01:43:40,417
I'b zorry.

1517
01:43:43,584 --> 01:43:45,626
I'b zorry!

1518
01:43:49,834 --> 01:43:52,417
I'b zorry!

1519
01:44:05,584 --> 01:44:07,125
What are you doing?

1520
01:44:08,167 --> 01:44:09,292
I thought seeing these photo--

1521
01:44:09,876 --> 01:44:13,125
would change sis's mind about wanting to die...

1522
01:44:17,751 --> 01:44:20,125
What should I have done?

1523
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,584
Crap, it can't be opened.

1524
01:45:09,751 --> 01:45:11,125
She's holding it shut!

1525
01:45:11,501 --> 01:45:13,876
Oh, Nishimiya-san?

1526
01:45:14,042 --> 01:45:17,125
How about going to the lobby? I'll buy you a drink.

1527
01:45:16,501 --> 01:45:18,501
(Hospital rooms #400-417)

1528
01:45:18,501 --> 01:45:21,000
I heard things between you and Ya-sho in the past.

1529
01:45:23,417 --> 01:45:25,834
"I destroyed what Ishida-kun created working so hard."

1530
01:45:26,751 --> 01:45:29,042
Do you mean what happened at the bridge?

1531
01:45:30,375 --> 01:45:34,334
Actually, Ya-sho accepted a trivial guy like me.

1532
01:45:34,834 --> 01:45:37,584
I learned what real friends are at that moment--

1533
01:45:37,709 --> 01:45:39,375
for the first time.

1534
01:45:43,959 --> 01:45:46,792
As Ya-sho is my best friend,

1535
01:45:46,918 --> 01:45:49,334
I'm totally at a loss until he wakes up again.

1536
01:45:57,417 --> 01:46:01,000
"I want to fix up what I destroyed."

1537
01:46:06,792 --> 01:46:09,542
It's silly you tried to kill yourself even if you were hurt!

1538
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,250
You're speaking too loud, Kawai-san...

1539
01:46:12,375 --> 01:46:16,334
Nishimiya-san can't hear unless we speak loudly!

1540
01:46:18,501 --> 01:46:21,042
Everyone worried about you!

1541
01:46:21,250 --> 01:46:24,542
We would have hard times as far as we live.

1542
01:46:25,125 --> 01:46:27,250
Not only you, everyone would, you know?

1543
01:46:27,417 --> 01:46:28,584
So,

1544
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:30,876
we have to go forward, loving ourselves,

1545
01:46:31,209 --> 01:46:34,000
as a whole including weaknesses.

1546
01:46:37,918 --> 01:46:39,584
I'm relieved to know you are okay now.

1547
01:46:43,125 --> 01:46:44,125
I see.

1548
01:46:44,375 --> 01:46:46,792
You're visiting around to meet members at the bridge.

1549
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,417
You're strong...

1550
01:46:50,584 --> 01:46:53,250
Honestly, I'm scared.

1551
01:46:53,918 --> 01:46:57,083
Even after Ishida-kun wakes up,

1552
01:46:57,209 --> 01:47:00,501
I would have no courage to see him again.

1553
01:47:00,834 --> 01:47:03,584
I couldn't change myself.

1554
01:47:04,125 --> 01:47:06,292
I ran away again and failed to save you again.

1555
01:47:06,626 --> 01:47:08,083
I'm still a coward.

1556
01:47:09,918 --> 01:47:12,292
Yu vill chanje vrom now on,

1557
01:47:14,209 --> 01:47:15,709
Saara-zan...

1558
01:47:18,918 --> 01:47:21,918
Thanks to come to meet me, Sho-chan.

1559
01:48:03,792 --> 01:48:07,000
Hey, stop it!

1560
01:48:16,292 --> 01:48:17,292
Nishimiya.

1561
01:48:18,417 --> 01:48:19,417
I found you.

1562
01:48:21,167 --> 01:48:22,709
Are you doing well?

1563
01:48:25,250 --> 01:48:26,250
Somewhat--

1564
01:48:26,918 --> 01:48:27,918
strange, isn't it? (laugh)

1565
01:48:29,959 --> 01:48:30,959
I am--

1566
01:48:31,375 --> 01:48:32,501
thinking I'd die.

1567
01:48:33,667 --> 01:48:34,667
Oh.

1568
01:48:35,501 --> 01:48:36,501
Tuesday is almost over.

1569
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Bye.

1570
01:48:41,042 --> 01:48:42,042
Nishimiya.

1571
01:49:44,459 --> 01:49:46,375
Nishimiya!

1572
01:49:49,709 --> 01:49:50,834
What's this?

1573
01:49:51,542 --> 01:49:52,626
Hey mom!

1574
01:49:52,751 --> 01:49:53,792
This...

1575
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:55,167
Get rid of this!

1576
01:50:02,626 --> 01:50:04,417
Nishimiya.

1577
01:50:07,083 --> 01:50:08,125
Nishimiya.

1578
01:50:17,167 --> 01:50:18,167
Nishimiya.

1579
01:50:19,042 --> 01:50:21,459
Nishimiya.

1580
01:50:23,042 --> 01:50:24,125
Nishimiya.

1581
01:50:39,083 --> 01:50:40,083
Yo!

1582
01:51:17,292 --> 01:51:18,417
Well..

1583
01:51:22,626 --> 01:51:24,000
Are you all right?

1584
01:51:30,667 --> 01:51:31,667
Yes.

1585
01:51:32,709 --> 01:51:33,959
I'm glad to know--

1586
01:51:35,167 --> 01:51:36,375
you are okay.

1587
01:51:40,542 --> 01:51:41,542
Nishimiya.

1588
01:51:41,918 --> 01:51:44,959
I'm okay now too.

1589
01:51:46,209 --> 01:51:47,626
...More or less.

1590
01:51:49,584 --> 01:51:53,125
Please stop making such a serious face.

1591
01:51:53,584 --> 01:51:54,751
And, let me say...

1592
01:51:58,042 --> 01:51:59,334
Nishimiya-san.

1593
01:52:01,292 --> 01:52:02,709
I'm sorry.

1594
01:52:03,501 --> 01:52:08,292
I never really apologized for what I had done in the past.

1595
01:52:09,167 --> 01:52:12,417
In addition, for what I did after we met again.

1596
01:52:12,709 --> 01:52:14,125
For so many things I did..

1597
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:17,167
Perhaps,

1598
01:52:17,417 --> 01:52:19,209
I interpreted you--

1599
01:52:19,334 --> 01:52:22,751
to suit my interest.

1600
01:52:23,417 --> 01:52:24,417
Actually, I wanted to--

1601
01:52:24,918 --> 01:52:27,167
talk more--

1602
01:52:27,334 --> 01:52:28,626
with you.

1603
01:52:30,209 --> 01:52:32,584
Perhaps that's all.

1604
01:52:33,292 --> 01:52:37,000
But my selfish behavior hurt you,

1605
01:52:37,834 --> 01:52:41,584
and forced you to choose the worst choice...

1606
01:52:43,125 --> 01:52:44,125
No, That'z nod corregd.

1607
01:52:44,501 --> 01:52:47,000
Begauze I had nod chenged,

1608
01:52:47,292 --> 01:52:48,959

1609
01:52:49,626 --> 01:52:51,083
I ab

1610
01:52:51,417 --> 01:52:54,501
todally blamed.

1611
01:52:55,083 --> 01:52:58,292
I thoughd everizing vould go vell

1612
01:52:58,709 --> 01:53:00,459
If I wend away..

1613
01:53:01,501 --> 01:53:04,292
I'b zorry...

1614
01:53:04,417 --> 01:53:06,459
Please don't cry, Nishimiya.

1615
01:53:10,542 --> 01:53:13,042
Well, Nishimiya.

1616
01:53:17,250 --> 01:53:19,542
Just now,

1617
01:53:19,667 --> 01:53:21,501
I talked to you in my dreams.

1618
01:53:22,584 --> 01:53:23,918
In the dream,

1619
01:53:24,542 --> 01:53:28,083
I tried to give up many things in my life.

1620
01:53:29,334 --> 01:53:31,792
But I realized it was not correct.

1621
01:53:32,375 --> 01:53:36,959
I'd been obsessed with the same thought as you,

1622
01:53:37,834 --> 01:53:38,959
but,

1623
01:53:39,709 --> 01:53:40,959
I realized,

1624
01:53:41,417 --> 01:53:45,209
that it still wasn't worth to death.

1625
01:53:47,083 --> 01:53:50,626
I wanna apologize to everyone, too.

1626
01:53:53,125 --> 01:53:55,751
So, Nishimiya.

1627
01:53:55,876 --> 01:53:56,876
I want...

1628
01:54:00,459 --> 01:54:01,584
I want you to--

1629
01:54:02,709 --> 01:54:04,000
help me--

1630
01:54:04,834 --> 01:54:06,209
live.

1631
01:54:15,209 --> 01:54:16,667
Nishimiya.

1632
01:54:22,542 --> 01:54:23,542
{\an8}<i>SL: Friends</i>

1633
01:54:37,959 --> 01:54:39,209
Oops!

1634
01:54:39,334 --> 01:54:42,292
What a creepy thing I just did!

1635
01:54:42,542 --> 01:54:43,626
Oh my gosh!

1636
01:54:43,792 --> 01:54:45,918
Sorry, and forget all, Nishimiya!

1637
01:54:46,042 --> 01:54:47,876
Forget what I did now!

1638
01:54:58,375 --> 01:55:00,876
{\an8}<i>SL: It's promise.</i>

1639
01:55:11,250 --> 01:55:13,542
Hey, customer! We're arrived!

1640
01:55:15,959 --> 01:55:19,250
Hey, Maria, are you watering flowers?

1641
01:55:19,375 --> 01:55:20,959
You are great!

1642
01:55:23,459 --> 01:55:25,876
You die? die? dieeeeeee?

1643
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:29,334
Maria, Sho-chan has brought back to life.

1644
01:55:29,459 --> 01:55:31,417
I'm not dead, Maria.

1645
01:55:32,417 --> 01:55:33,918
Is she Ueno-san?

1646
01:55:35,501 --> 01:55:38,792
She had taken care of you when you were unconscious.

1647
01:55:39,250 --> 01:55:41,000
Say thanks to her.

1648
01:55:43,542 --> 01:55:45,292
I heard you took care of me.

1649
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,834
I'm really a no-good one...

1650
01:55:49,834 --> 01:55:52,042
I still, or even more,

1651
01:55:52,167 --> 01:55:56,334
unable to like Nishimiya-san.

1652
01:55:57,417 --> 01:55:59,292
Huh, it may be okay not to force me liking her...

1653
01:55:59,834 --> 01:56:01,959
By the way, it was Shimada and the guys--

1654
01:56:02,083 --> 01:56:05,209
who saved you when you fell into the river.

1655
01:56:06,083 --> 01:56:08,375
They asked me not to tell it to you, but I wanna you to know.

1656
01:56:09,167 --> 01:56:10,167
Ishida.

1657
01:56:11,375 --> 01:56:12,709
Welcome back!

1658
01:56:13,167 --> 01:56:15,125
Then I'll go home.

1659
01:56:16,459 --> 01:56:17,751
Thank you.

1660
01:56:27,083 --> 01:56:29,167
Oh, it's too short, isn't it!?

1661
01:56:29,501 --> 01:56:32,042
No, no, you will be the cutest in such short hair!

1662
01:56:32,209 --> 01:56:33,751
Hi, welcome back, Sho-chan.

1663
01:56:33,876 --> 01:56:34,876
H...hello.

1664
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:36,792
H--hi, welcome to the salon...

1665
01:56:38,959 --> 01:56:40,417
Ishida-kun.

1666
01:56:41,542 --> 01:56:42,751
I'm sorry for what happened around.

1667
01:56:42,918 --> 01:56:45,167
No, I'm sorry too.

1668
01:56:45,375 --> 01:56:47,417
That's right. My son is immortal.

1669
01:56:47,584 --> 01:56:50,334
Hi mom, I'll go to pick Maria up.

1670
01:56:50,542 --> 01:56:51,876
What!? Who is that guy?

1671
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,501
My daughter's husband. He came back from Brazil.

1672
01:56:55,167 --> 01:56:58,000
Sho-chan, Yuzu-chan is in your room.

1673
01:56:58,459 --> 01:57:00,542
Take some desserts from the refrigerator for her.

1674
01:57:00,667 --> 01:57:02,042
Hey.

1675
01:57:02,334 --> 01:57:03,417
Hi.

1676
01:57:03,792 --> 01:57:05,792
Is that your winter-season uniform? That's fit to you.

1677
01:57:05,918 --> 01:57:07,375
By the way, take a look on this.

1678
01:57:07,667 --> 01:57:10,375
Oh, my. Great!

1679
01:57:10,501 --> 01:57:11,834
And. take another look on this.

1680
01:57:12,083 --> 01:57:14,542
Oh, my...great...

1681
01:57:14,792 --> 01:57:16,042
Have mercy, kind sir!

1682
01:57:16,167 --> 01:57:18,250
You must help me study!

1683
01:57:18,501 --> 01:57:19,709
Sure. Of course I will.

1684
01:57:23,584 --> 01:57:26,125
You have resumed to go to school, haven't you?

1685
01:57:26,334 --> 01:57:28,918
Yes. Shoko gave me a trigger to resume.

1686
01:57:30,751 --> 01:57:33,501
Well, I'll do my best.

1687
01:57:33,918 --> 01:57:35,667
I wanna meet her expectations.

1688
01:57:38,125 --> 01:57:40,042
By the way, a school festival will be held tomorrow?

1689
01:57:40,501 --> 01:57:42,042
Yes.

1690
01:57:47,501 --> 01:57:48,000
"From: Shoko Nishimiya, Title: Hello"

1691
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:49,209
"It was said everyone's going to the school festival tomorrow."

1692
01:57:49,209 --> 01:57:50,209
"I'll meet you at the front gate at 10:00, okay?"

1693
01:57:51,167 --> 01:57:52,918
Good morning, everyone!

1694
01:57:53,292 --> 01:57:54,584
How have you all been?

1695
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,209
I'm sorry for what I said at the bridge!

1696
01:58:07,375 --> 01:58:08,375
It's time to go!

1697
01:58:08,542 --> 01:58:09,542
I'm going to school!

1698
01:58:09,667 --> 01:58:10,667
Bye! Cheer up!

1699
01:58:11,125 --> 01:58:12,667
Oh!

1700
01:58:12,792 --> 01:58:14,584
These items are used like that!

1701
01:58:14,709 --> 01:58:15,501
What?

1702
01:58:15,626 --> 01:58:18,083
Nothing. I'll go.

1703
01:58:18,209 --> 01:58:19,792
Good luck!

1704
01:58:35,334 --> 01:58:36,918
Good morning.

1705
01:58:37,209 --> 01:58:40,167
{\an8}<i>SL: Good morning.</i>

1706
01:58:40,459 --> 01:58:41,667
Why don't we get going?

1707
01:58:43,209 --> 01:58:49,000
"Welcome to the 45th Tochi High School Festival"

1708
01:58:50,375 --> 01:58:52,292
Hey, isn't that Ishida?

1709
01:58:53,209 --> 01:58:54,209
Who is he?

1710
01:58:54,375 --> 01:58:56,876
Huh? The jumping-into guy?

1711
01:58:59,751 --> 01:59:00,792
{\an8}<i>SL: What's wrong with you?</i>

1712
01:59:02,667 --> 01:59:04,959
Honestly, it's the first time I tell you,

1713
01:59:05,083 --> 01:59:08,292
I don't really fit in at school.

1714
01:59:08,626 --> 01:59:09,626
{\an8}<i>SL: Why?</i>

1715
01:59:10,834 --> 01:59:15,000
I have difficulty at looking everyone in the eyes.

1716
01:59:15,334 --> 01:59:19,209
So it is easier for me to look downward.

1717
01:59:22,667 --> 01:59:24,834
Huh? It's okay to look downward?

1718
01:59:27,125 --> 01:59:28,542
Ni...Nishimiya...

1719
01:59:29,083 --> 01:59:31,334
I can walk normally by myself, you know.

1720
01:59:32,375 --> 01:59:33,918
Thank you, Nishimiya.

1721
01:59:34,292 --> 01:59:36,209
Here is my class.

1722
01:59:37,792 --> 01:59:39,250
Is the water boiled?

1723
01:59:39,375 --> 01:59:40,918
Not yet, wait a moment.

1724
01:59:41,501 --> 01:59:43,834
Ishida-kun? Hey, it's Ishida-kun!

1725
01:59:43,959 --> 01:59:46,501
Are you okay now?

1726
01:59:48,334 --> 01:59:49,542
Nishimiya...

1727
01:59:49,792 --> 01:59:52,834
I'm feeling like a kind of stomachache.

1728
01:59:54,501 --> 01:59:55,501
Sorry.

1729
01:59:55,667 --> 01:59:56,542
Ya-sho!

1730
02:00:09,751 --> 02:00:10,834
Ya-sho?

1731
02:00:12,417 --> 02:00:13,792
Nagatsuka--kun?

1732
02:00:14,125 --> 02:00:16,125
Ya-sho, are you suffering stomachache?

1733
02:00:18,959 --> 02:00:19,959
Ya-sho.

1734
02:00:20,501 --> 02:00:23,709
Hi, Nagatsuka-kun. Good morning. How have you been?

1735
02:00:24,334 --> 02:00:25,834
Ya-sho.

1736
02:00:25,959 --> 02:00:27,876
Why are you looking downward?

1737
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,209
Oh, really? I don't know why.

1738
02:00:30,667 --> 02:00:34,209
Actually I went here to raise my face to meet everyone.

1739
02:00:34,375 --> 02:00:35,459
But I might be a bit scared...

1740
02:00:36,042 --> 02:00:38,250
Hey, Ya-sho...?

1741
02:00:38,584 --> 02:00:39,584
Ishida-kun!!

1742
02:00:40,417 --> 02:00:42,751
I'm really happy you come back.

1743
02:00:44,042 --> 02:00:45,542
If you...

1744
02:00:46,167 --> 02:00:48,501
If you hadn't waken up again,

1745
02:00:48,626 --> 02:00:51,501
I would have lost everything.

1746
02:00:52,292 --> 02:00:52,959
Ya-sho,

1747
02:00:53,292 --> 02:00:55,209
Don't be mind any more--

1748
02:00:55,334 --> 02:00:56,459
what happened at the bridge.

1749
02:00:56,792 --> 02:00:59,834
Such minor troubles will happen again and again as far as we live.

1750
02:01:00,334 --> 02:01:02,667
So, Ya-sho, please,

1751
02:01:03,083 --> 02:01:05,501
please never go far away leaving me!

1752
02:01:05,709 --> 02:01:07,083
Pleeeease!

1753
02:01:07,209 --> 02:01:08,834
Nagatsuka-kun...

1754
02:01:10,417 --> 02:01:11,542
I'm very sorry--

1755
02:01:11,667 --> 02:01:14,250
for so many things.

1756
02:01:15,501 --> 02:01:16,584
And,

1757
02:01:17,250 --> 02:01:18,459
thank you.

1758
02:01:18,792 --> 02:01:20,751
Ya-sho!

1759
02:01:21,209 --> 02:01:22,792
By the way, what's happened with your mustache?

1760
02:01:23,417 --> 02:01:27,501
This was a pray icon for your recovery.

1761
02:01:28,042 --> 02:01:29,792
Nagatsuka-kun...

1762
02:01:35,417 --> 02:01:36,959
Why does everyone come...

1763
02:01:37,083 --> 02:01:41,417
We heard Nagatsuka-kun was calling Ishida-kun's name.

1764
02:01:41,792 --> 02:01:43,083
I see.

1765
02:01:43,459 --> 02:01:46,542
Kawai-san, you have the you-know-what to give him,

1766
02:01:46,667 --> 02:01:47,667
don't you?

1767
02:01:47,709 --> 02:01:49,751
Huh...yes, I have.

1768
02:01:49,876 --> 02:01:52,125
But it was a failure, so we cannot give him it...

1769
02:01:52,375 --> 02:01:54,834
Why not? Let's give it to him.

1770
02:01:55,292 --> 02:01:56,667
Okay...

1771
02:02:00,250 --> 02:02:02,334
This is for you...

1772
02:02:02,459 --> 02:02:05,584
I really worked hard to collect full thousand of cranes,

1773
02:02:05,709 --> 02:02:07,042
but I couldn't. It is far less than that...

1774
02:02:07,459 --> 02:02:10,375
I asked all the classmates again and again, but...

1775
02:02:10,584 --> 02:02:11,876
I'm very sorry.

1776
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:13,626
N--No, it's amazing!

1777
02:02:13,751 --> 02:02:14,918
It's enough.

1778
02:02:15,042 --> 02:02:17,250
I've never gotten anything like that before,

1779
02:02:17,375 --> 02:02:19,209
so I am really happy.

1780
02:02:19,834 --> 02:02:21,334
Thank you Kawai-san.

1781
02:02:21,459 --> 02:02:23,375
And, I'm sorry.

1782
02:02:23,542 --> 02:02:24,542
I'm sorry too, Mashiba-kun.

1783
02:02:25,083 --> 02:02:27,459
Not at all. You are amazing.

1784
02:02:27,584 --> 02:02:29,626
Ugh!

1785
02:02:29,751 --> 02:02:32,667
You are playing friends, that's make me sick!

1786
02:02:32,792 --> 02:02:35,501
You are so nasty as always saying such things, Nao-chan!

1787
02:02:35,792 --> 02:02:37,876
Huh? Kawai-tchi?

1788
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:38,876
Time to fight?

1789
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,125
Hey, stop it, both of two!

1790
02:02:41,501 --> 02:02:43,209
Oh...Ishida-kun.

1791
02:02:43,876 --> 02:02:45,709
I'm sorry, Ishida-kun.

1792
02:02:46,042 --> 02:02:48,918
You have been through so much,

1793
02:02:49,667 --> 02:02:51,167
while I have not changed a bit.

1794
02:02:52,751 --> 02:02:53,918
Don't say so.

1795
02:02:54,584 --> 02:02:55,959
I'm sorry, too...

1796
02:02:57,334 --> 02:03:00,459
Hey, we don't talk nothing so negative or serious now!.

1797
02:03:00,918 --> 02:03:02,584
{\an8}<i>SL: I'm sorry.</i>

1798
02:03:02,918 --> 02:03:04,417
You said sorry again!

1799
02:03:05,626 --> 02:03:08,334
But, I suppose that is your personality.

1800
02:03:09,167 --> 02:03:10,792
Stu--pit! (Ha / ka)

1801
02:03:15,501 --> 02:03:17,125
Stu--pid. (Ba / ka)

1802
02:03:17,834 --> 02:03:19,292
Stupid! (Baka!)

1803
02:03:25,459 --> 02:03:27,083
Hey, I'm now hungry.

1804
02:03:27,292 --> 02:03:28,584
I'll go out to eat fried chickens!

1805
02:03:28,918 --> 02:03:29,918
Oh, she ran away.

1806
02:03:29,959 --> 02:03:31,292
No, she got embarrassed.

1807
02:03:34,459 --> 02:03:35,459
Hi, everyone,

1808
02:03:35,542 --> 02:03:38,083
I have a favor to ask you all.

1809
02:03:38,292 --> 02:03:39,292
Is it okay?

1810
02:03:40,918 --> 02:03:45,375
I want to go around the school festival together.

1811
02:04:04,292 --> 02:04:06,209
Hmmm, it tastes really good!

1812
02:04:06,334 --> 02:04:08,459
Let's go to the gym next!

1813
02:04:08,626 --> 02:04:10,834
I'm amazed he can even show his face at school.

1814
02:04:10,959 --> 02:04:13,459
Hey, hey, the stall by class #B is really good!

1815
02:04:13,626 --> 02:04:14,626
Let's go together!

1816
02:05:57,667 --> 02:06:00,709
"Fell in love"

1817
02:06:00,834 --> 02:06:07,375
Ah...I fell in love...

1818
02:06:25,459 --> 02:06:28,209
Well, please raise your face

1819
02:06:28,209 --> 02:06:32,375
Then you can see I am here, in front of you

1820
02:06:32,375 --> 02:06:37,167
So stop crying any more

1821
02:06:41,250 --> 02:06:47,751
You gave me a special time even when my heart had been broken

1822
02:06:47,751 --> 02:06:55,751
A red which was a bit tangled

1823
02:07:00,459 --> 02:07:08,459
A white which was a color of corridor in these days

1824
02:07:12,292 --> 02:07:20,292
The beginning, the last time, and now

1825
02:07:22,584 --> 02:07:30,584
I'll convey you carving on petals which are fluttering

1826
02:07:34,292 --> 02:07:35,792
Darling,

1827
02:07:35,792 --> 02:07:43,792
I and you are reflected on raindrops

1828
02:07:45,876 --> 02:07:53,876
No one in the world knows

1829
02:08:01,417 --> 02:08:07,042
Ah...I fell in love... I don't remember since when

1830
02:08:07,042 --> 02:08:10,542
How many times I cried

1831
02:08:10,542 --> 02:08:16,417
If I count it, it will take whole night

1832
02:08:16,417 --> 02:08:21,167
I'll be puzzled...

1833
02:08:21,167 --> 02:08:25,501
Darling,

1834
02:08:34,250 --> 02:08:41,792
What I want to convey to you now

1835
02:08:42,792 --> 02:08:47,167
has been same and not changed

1836
02:08:47,167 --> 02:08:55,167
since the past time.

1837
02:08:56,334 --> 02:08:57,751
Darling,

1838
02:08:57,751 --> 02:09:05,751
The only one signpost

1839
02:09:08,042 --> 02:09:16,042
we can walk without losing the way
