1
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,342
Come on, we're at Pondolem.

2
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:31,841
Let's go, Pondolem.

3
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:37,273
Let's go, Pondolem.

4
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,250
Be careful, Peter.

5
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,217
Breakfast or beer?

6
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,856
Where's Pondolem police station?
The new one?

7
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,760
Are you a police officer?
- Yes.

8
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,136
Here it is. Right in front of us.

9
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:00,366
It was inaugurated just last week.
- I see.

10
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,171
The faded one right next to it
is the old police station.

11
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,278
Okay, thanks.

12
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,742
All the police officers have
breakfast here.

13
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:12,174
Some of them eat breakfast,
lunch and dinner right here.

14
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:13,677
I see.

15
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,252
Come over, after duty hours.

16
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:17,754
<i>I'll</i> serve you chilled beer
and fried fish.

17
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,021
Let's see.

18
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:30,832
Excuse me.

19
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,168
Who's the Senior Pl'?

20
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:34,966
Who are you?
- Satish Naik.

21
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,676
I have been transferred here.

22
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,569
Sir, do come in.
You're welcome.

23
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,574
Have a seat.
Sir will be here, soon.

24
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,555
Listen.

25
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,589
Isn't that Vijay Salgaonkar'?

26
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,790
Yes, sir.
That's him.

27
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:04,001
He seems to be pretty
straight forward.

28
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:07,500
But, appearances can
be deceptive, sir.

29
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:10,975
What do you mean?
- I mean, what he's done...

30
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:12,702
...is still pretty unbelievable.

31
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,341
Vijay, sir.

32
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,547
Get him, get him. Hey, hey, hey.

33
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:52,615
Go.

34
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,319
That was an awesome chase, sir!

35
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,621
Awesome?

36
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,157
They've edited it with fast cuts
and taken the audience for a ride.

37
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:08,529
On top of that, the music
is pounding away!

38
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,169
So that it seems as if
a lot is going on.

39
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:11,964
But, nothing is really happening.

40
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,570
You need to feel
the tension. Feel it!

41
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:16,164
Mr. Vijay, I have an idea.

42
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:17,903
You know, you should make
a movie.

43
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,342
I mean, then the world will see
that you...

44
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,181
<i>I'll</i> show it to you, first.
- No!

45
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:24,046
Mr. Vijay! No! Sorry, sir!

46
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,183
Are you done
with the collections?

47
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:27,219
Yes, I'm done.
Here, look.

48
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,217
As always, Inspector
Gaitonde cribbed a bit.

49
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,816
And, uncle Pinto's TV
is flickering.

50
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:36,224
That's a problem with his TV.
It's not a cable issue.

51
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,790
Tell him to buy a new one.
- You bet, I did!

52
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,530
<i>Then?</i>
<i>"k-k-k</i>

53
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:45,070
That's what he called you.
- And you let him abuse me'?

54
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,467
No, no, I didn't!
I told him.

55
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,976
I said, if you want to abuse
Mr. Vijay...

56
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:52,374
...say something logical.

57
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,108
You can call him uneducated,
illiterate, 4th grade dropout...

58
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:59,583
...call him an orphan.
But, “*7 No, never.

59
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,951
Am I right'?
Or am I right'?

60
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,815
Alright, then!
- Listen to me.

61
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:06,718
You're absolutely right.
<i>I'll</i> give you a bonus. - A bonus!

62
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,085
Mr. Vijay, no! Sir, no!

63
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,634
He's waiting for SI Gaitonde.

64
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,410
Why?
- Don't ask.

65
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:29,547
He locked up
his only son in prison.

66
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,577
What did he do'?

67
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:35,549
Nothing. He took a loan from
a private finance company.

68
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,817
He used to pay all
the installments on time.

69
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:40,651
He just wasn't able to pay
the final installment.

70
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:44,159
Mr. Gaitonde took my
son away, two days ago.

71
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,524
Now, the finance company
is also saying...

72
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:49,258
...that, the installment has to be
paid with interest, first.

73
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,225
That's when they'll let my
son go.

74
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,002
Why is Gaitonde taking such an
interest in this?

75
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,303
Because, his cousin runs
the finance company.

76
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:00,709
So, did you complain
to Mr. Prabhu'?

77
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,908
Mr. Gaitonde told me...

78
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:05,545
...if I complain to anyone
at all...

79
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,117
...then, he will kill my son.

80
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:10,448
Anyway, what's 'the point oi
complaining?

81
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,647
Then, file a lawsuit in the court.

82
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,590
On whom'?

83
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,322
His son wasn't locked up
by the finance company...

84
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,855
...Gaitonde did that.

85
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:24,366
'There is only one way
to get your brother out.'

86
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,529
'What's that?
- Habeas corpus.'

87
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:30,003
<i>I'll</i> tell you what to do.
Habeas corpus.

88
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,669
What'? Hibbus...

89
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,869
Habeas corpus.
It's a legal 'term.

90
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:35,207
How will that help?

91
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,943
His son will get
released, because...

92
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,848
'This is not an ordinary case.'

93
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,045
'This is a case
involving habeas corpus.'

94
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,645
And if they tell the court...

95
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:45,554
mthat someone has locked up
his son illegally...

96
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,753
...then, the court will order the
police to at once...

97
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:50,319
...present the man in the
court.'

98
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:54,525
Then, Gaitonde or 'the senior Pl
or IG, can't ignore 'the court's order.

99
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,966
The police will not present him
in the court.

100
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,505
Because Gaitonde locked him up
illegally.

101
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:02,572
Why don't you do this?
I know a lawyer in Panaji.

102
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,870
Shirish Kamath.
<i>I'll</i> give you his number.

103
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,675
Tell him, this is a matter
concerning Habeas corpus.

104
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,178
I will speak to him, too.

105
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,514
Speak of the devil
and the devil appears!

106
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:15,309
He's coming this way.

107
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:16,752
You have to get out of here.

108
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:18,586
Leave, by the back door.

109
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:25,931
Hey, Martin!
- Hmm.

110
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:27,864
Did an old couple come here?

111
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,827
Not at all.
- Where the heck did they go?

112
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,177
What do you think'?

113
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,387
Are you the only
one who can act'?

114
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:51,387
Today, I have managed
to act, somehow.

115
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,150
I love you, dad.

116
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:55,620
Come on, and wipe your
tears, dad.

117
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:57,093
Here's the handkerchief.

118
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:58,957
Wipe your tears!

119
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:02,624
You now carry a handkerchief
in your pocket'?

120
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:06,168
Sumi! I don't have to
worry about anything!

121
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,370
Your son is very responsible, now.
- Mr. Vijay.

122
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:09,805
Mr. vijav!

123
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,474
Mr. Vijay, can I go home?
lfs really late.

124
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:14,503
Thank you.

125
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,611
Hello? Mirage Cable.

126
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:24,882
Yes, yes, yes.

127
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:26,988
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

128
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:28,618
<i>Yes, I'll</i> do that.
<i>I'll</i> do <i>it.</i>

129
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,662
Right away! Yes. Yes!

130
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:34,189
Seems you received quiet a drubbing.
What is it'?

131
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,790
Actually, ifs aunt Saldanha...

132
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:38,860
...the amplifier near her
place is not working. So I am...

133
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:41,229
You just changed that
three days ago.

134
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:43,201
I forgot about that.

135
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:45,502
That's nice, you deserve
the drubbing.

136
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,236
I am going there, at once.

137
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,583
What else did you forget'?

138
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,483
Hello, I... I...

139
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:58,246
Yes, done, done.

140
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:03,354
Mr. Shirodkar who is 75 years
old has a request.

141
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:06,261
Screen a nice, adult
movie, today.

142
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:09,367
But, wasn't he paralyzed?

143
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:13,037
Come on, Mr. Vijay!
His left side is paralyzed.

144
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,130
Whereas Shirodkar is
right handed.

145
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:17,301
Get lost! Scat!
- No, I'm going.

146
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:20,411
We can't lose, dad.
We have to win.

147
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,344
I love you, dad.

148
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,946
My son.

149
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:56,381
Good morning.
- Good morning.

150
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:59,114
How are the studies coming along?
- Doing fine.

151
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,816
Where is mom'?
- In the kitchen.

152
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,665
Where are the keys to the vault?
Tell me the truth!

153
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:22,168
Which vault'? I really don't know.
Let me go, please.

154
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,175
Who knows, if you don't'?

155
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,846
Vijay. __
- Who's vuav?

156
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,413
The man who's threatening
me with a carrot.

157
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:34,553
And, it seems, he hasn't
even bathed, yet.

158
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,818
You're reeking of sweat.

159
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,787
I would bathe, if you heat the
water.

160
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:42,460
Check in 'the bathroom.
It's already 'there.

161
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,831
You come too.
- Get away! Naughty!

162
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:52,464
Go!

163
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,500
So, where's Miss India?

164
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,938
She's probably rehearsing her
cat walk in front of the mirror.

165
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,373
Anu!
- <i>I'll</i> be right there, mom.

166
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,744
Good morning, dad.
- Good morning.

167
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:13,324
I was calling you last night.
But, I couldn't get through.

168
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:16,585
Did the phone die on you again?
- Yes.

169
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:19,029
Why don't you buy a cell phone?

170
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,468
What's the use?
That place is out of range.

171
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:26,301
Really? So, how does Jose
get the range on his mobile?

172
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:30,332
Ifs not like that. You want an
excuse to be away from us.

173
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,041
The three of us stay here
alone and you are...

174
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:37,276
One moment. Since there are
three of you, you're not alone.

175
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:42,113
Don't crack silly jokes.

176
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:45,550
You'd rather sit in office
and watch movies than come home.

177
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:49,459
You don't have any
sense of responsibility towards us.

178
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:51,790
You should consider us,
at least.

179
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,662
Okay, fine.
What do you want'?

180
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,170
My darling wife! Speak up!

181
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,875
We want to go to Panaji.

182
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:08,847
Why?

183
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:10,582
For shopping-

184
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:13,745
We just went shopping,
six months ago.

185
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:16,478
Yes, we did shop.

186
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,115
You bought the cheapest
clothes, to save money.

187
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:21,284
Their colors have faded,
within six months.

188
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:24,961
So, 'this 'time, let's shop here,
instead oi going 'to Panaji.

189
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:28,123
No! We want to go to Panaji.

190
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,995
We don't just want to shop.

191
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:32,002
We also want to watch a movie.

192
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:34,472
And we want to eat a pizza too.

193
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:37,301
And ice cream?
- Yes, ice cream, too!

194
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:44,573
People do all sorts oi things
'for their 'family. What do you do?

195
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,008
You can't even buy us
an ice cream!

196
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:48,551
Don't be so absurd!

197
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:50,551
You can buy ice cream
at Martin's too!

198
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:51,951
What's so special about Panaji'?

199
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,252
You're denying our wishes.
Correct?

200
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,824
Majority wins and you're
still saying no!

201
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:58,826
We shall see.

202
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:00,833
I didn't say no.

203
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,699
I just asked.

204
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:04,697
Does that mean, we're
going to Panap'?

205
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,666
Yes.
- Are you sure'?

206
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,806
This Sunday, we are going
to Panaji.

207
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:10,066
Happy?

208
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:28,725
"What is it about you, life?"

209
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:38,863
"What is it about you, life?"

210
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:44,566
"Am I a copy of you?"

211
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:50,774
"Or, do you reflect me?"

212
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,496
"What is it about you, life?"

213
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:10,131
"What is it about you, life?"

214
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:35,122
"You are clinging to me."

215
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:40,229
"You tickle my soles."

216
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:44,491
"You are a little irritable."

217
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:48,796
"You are slightly arrogant."

218
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,503
"You argue with me."

219
00:16:53,912 --> 00:17:00,079
"Let's meet little further
down the road."

220
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:08,894
"What is it about you, life?"

221
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,800
There's a nature camp,
the next week.

222
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:29,744
And, two students from
each school in Goa are selected.

223
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:33,583
And, I've been selected
from my school.

224
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:35,310
That's really nice.

225
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,389
Yes, but.

226
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,320
I've told her, she can't go.

227
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,753
Why?

228
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,591
She should go for a nature camp.

229
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:45,853
Nandini, real knowledge
is not found only in books.

230
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:47,499
You have to visit new places
for that.

231
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:48,691
You have to meet different
kinds of people.

232
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,030
You have to experience
new things.

233
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,371
In that case, why don't
you pay the fees'?

234
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,832
The fees'?
- Rs. 1800.

235
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,248
I think, real knowledge
is found only in books.

236
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:09,081
What'? You just said yes!

237
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:10,948
You can't go back on your word.

238
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:15,820
Please, let me do this.
Please?

239
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:17,760
Okay, fine.
- Thank you!

240
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,960
"A frown comes along
in the middle of a laugh."

241
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:27,999
"Just let me catch my breath."

242
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:34,676
"All the autumn leaves
will fall away."

243
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:41,716
"Let me understand this."

244
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:46,891
"A bit of a firecracker."

245
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,421
"A bit sprightly and teasing."

246
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:56,595
"You are a chain that ties me
down."

247
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:02,238
"Why don't you turn
back to me, some time?"

248
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:17,482
"What is it about you, life?"

249
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:33,562
"What is it about you, life?"

250
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:43,849
"What is it about you, life?"

251
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:48,911
"Am I a copy of you?"

252
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:55,450
"Or, do you reflect me?"

253
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,628
Mr. Vijay! It's been so long!

254
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:04,064
How are you, Rajesh?
- Fine.

255
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:05,661
How's the social work going on?
- Well...

256
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:08,172
There's more politics
than social work involved.

257
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,401
Right. Our group has established
a political party.

258
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:12,908
The Goa Jana Party.

259
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:14,501
I'm working on that.

260
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,877
What's that in your hand?

261
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:19,850
There is a stone quarry about
15 kms away in Paavelim.

262
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:20,985
I mean, it was there, earlier.

263
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:23,245
We shut it down
after protesting against it.

264
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:26,258
Why?
- The project is not eco friendly.

265
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:29,821
There is a lake right in the
middle of the quarry. Have a look.

266
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:31,661
Alright, I've got to leave.

267
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,026
See you.
- Bye Sis!

268
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,460
So, as I was saying...

269
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:40,130
...the girls are growing up.

270
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:41,229
They are smart, too.

271
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,399
They should get into
a good school.

272
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,072
For example..
- St. Thomas.

273
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,075
St. Thomas.

274
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:50,279
I've heard very good things
about that school.

275
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:53,274
From whom'?
From Nandini, right'?

276
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:56,747
Yes, I told her.
So what'?

277
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:57,982
I knew it.

278
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,058
Only you can come up with
such an uneducated idea.

279
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,593
Who are you calling uneducated?

280
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,185
I'm more educated than you.

281
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,093
Right, you've got a doctorate.

282
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,823
I admit, I only studied
till the tenth grade.

283
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:08,294
But at least, I cleared the exams!

284
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,633
I didn't fail in the
fourth grade, like you.

285
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:12,199
That's where you're wrong.

286
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,168
Clearing papers doesn't teach you
everything.

287
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:15,864
What'?
- You bet!

288
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,969
Once, it took me four
whole hours to explain to her...

289
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:21,445
mthat, Sonu Nigam's brother
isn't called Telephone Nigam.

290
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:23,173
She just wouldn't believe me.

291
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,450
Just keep quiet!
You always..

292
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,247
Listen, please don't get
into another tight the both ot you!

293
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,955
And you don't need to go to
St. Thomas to know all that.

294
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:33,989
At least, don't scrimp
when it comes to education.

295
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:35,985
I'm not scrimping.
I'm being sensible.

296
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:38,128
Ifs not necessary everything
that is expensive is good.

297
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,125
Besides, those who really
wish to study...

298
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,494
...can study at any school
and make it big.

299
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:44,099
What do you say, Fatherfin-law)?
Am I right'?

300
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:47,804
Yes, my son.
You're absolutely right. Right.

301
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:52,308
Get it moving, quickly.

302
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:55,005
Hello, Plane!
- Hello, uncle Martin! How are you?

303
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,377
Okay.
- What brings you here?

304
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:59,213
So, 'the work has begun.
- Yes, it'll be done, soon.

305
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:16,799
Are you done with the
collections?

306
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:18,727
Yes, you bet!

307
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:21,669
What about D'costa and Bandodkafs
complaints?

308
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:23,732
Yes, I'm on my way there.

309
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,810
Then, leave!
- Of course, <i>I'll</i> go.

310
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:27,736
I really want you to leave!
- Yes.

311
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,912
Let me finish my special tea.

312
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,350
Where is it'?
- Here...

313
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:36,812
Peter! Hey, Peter!

314
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,788
Where's my special tea'?

315
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:42,323
You! - No, no! Behind you, sir!
I'm leaving!

316
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:44,325
Hey!
" Crazy!

317
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:47,197
Is he crazy?

318
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:48,593
What's the matter, Vijay?

319
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,468
He's getting too smart
for his own good.

320
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:52,828
Forget about it.
He's a kid.

321
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:57,331
Listen, Mr. Plane, 'this is
Mr. Vijay Salgaonkar.

322
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:01,210
He owns Mirage Cable.
- Really? That's nice.

323
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,747
This is contractor Plane.

324
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:04,373
He is working on 'the construction
oi 'the police station.

325
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,039
Okay, okay.
Do come in.

326
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:07,343
After you.
- Sit down.

327
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:18,825
Uncle Martin said you
need to get some odd jobs done.

328
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:21,828
I have a...
- Hey, Martin!

329
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:24,630
I asked you it that old couple
came over the other day.

330
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:26,032
You said no.

331
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:28,129
You think I am some...?

332
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,737
I know, they came here.

333
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:34,779
Some smart chap taught them
a few legal lessons.

334
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,438
What the heck!

335
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:39,743
What are you saying?
I don't remember anything.

336
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:42,977
Really? So, your
memory is failing.

337
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:45,816
Or, are you trying to
protect that wise guy'?

338
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:48,388
Listen, I'm an old man.

339
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,919
Right. Old man.

340
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,733
So, Vijay. Do you remember
the old couple?

341
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:00,068
Which old couple?

342
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,509
Hey, Peter'?
What's on the menu today?

343
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:07,909
The usual.

344
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,773
What is this, uncle? You should
have a today's special!

345
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,914
I'm fed up of eating
the same food, every day.

346
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:15,280
What to do, son?

347
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:17,418
I am bored, too.
- See'?

348
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:20,748
But normally, my customers
pay for their meals later.

349
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:24,293
Some of them, even eat
free of cost.

350
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:25,796
Right.

351
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:28,599
For example, Vijay.

352
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:32,726
I don't pay for
my meals, later.

353
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:35,699
I clear my bills every week.

354
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:40,939
So, that means you're
taunting me, uncle.

355
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,171
No, no! Just talking
in general.

356
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:45,444
No, let's settle your account
today.

357
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:48,446
Why do you keep going
on and on about money?

358
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,212
What will you do
with all that money?

359
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:53,382
<i>I'll</i> put a today's special
on the menu.

360
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,822
Really? How much do
I owe you?

361
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:00,426
Forget about it, sir.
Forget it.

362
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,989
Take it, uncle.

363
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:04,726
When a cop offers to pay,
you should take it at once.

364
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,799
Just keep your nose out of this.

365
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:09,031
Cheeky fellow!

366
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:10,538
We're having it out, here.

367
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:12,967
So, how much do I owe you?
Don't feel shy, tell me.

368
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:14,838
Rs. 3542.

369
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,904
So, you remember that
number really well!

370
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,574
But, you don't remember that
old couple!

371
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:21,377
I write my accounts
down, you see.

372
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:22,748
Okay, fine.

373
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:26,220
Rs. 3542. That's it'?!

374
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:29,121
Cheapskate!
Rs. 3600.

375
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:30,957
Let's make it a round figure.

376
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:33,090
I'm going to settle it,
right away.

377
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:34,663
Uncle, let's just assume...

378
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,096
...you've paid me Rs. 3600
as commission.

379
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:38,736
What's the commission for'?

380
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,502
Don't you see that
right in front'?

381
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:44,165
The new police station
is being constructed.

382
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,037
So, all the workers
from there...

383
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,838
...come here to eat
food.

384
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,343
Why?

385
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:50,909
Thanks to me.

386
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,913
Look at that! Contractor
Rane is sitting here, too.

387
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:55,611
What's up, Rene'?

388
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:58,052
I have given you so many
customers...

389
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:00,819
...so, I should get paid a
commission tor that, uncle.

390
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:04,261
These days, at our police
station...

391
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:07,023
we are observing
'the police is your friend' week.

392
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:16,134
The police really know
how to eat well.

393
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,134
At least, work out a bit.

394
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,608
What's your problem?

395
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:26,616
There is no other hotel
around here, except this one.

396
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,816
That's why the construction
workers come here to eat.

397
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:31,716
You're not needed for that.

398
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:33,647
I am a cop.

399
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:36,088
I can stop them from coming here.

400
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:40,760
Hello, Martin!
- Hello, sir.

401
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:43,000
Peter, get Mr. Sawant some
coffee.

402
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:46,494
Vijay, how are you doing'?

403
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:49,704
We were working out a deal.

404
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,306
We just settled on the commission.

405
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:52,738
What's the commission for'?

406
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:56,874
<i>For 'the meals o'f 'the construction</i>
<i>workers at 'the new police station.</i>

407
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:58,579
Who's taking a commission?

408
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,479
Mr. Sawant, coffee.

409
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:05,985
Yes.

410
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:09,589
Mr. Sawant, I know,
I should not be saying this.

411
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:12,589
What's the meaning of
the police is your friend week?

412
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:17,427
<i>It's 'the</i> duty <i>oi 'the police 'to
be friendly</i> and <i>help 'the public.</i>

413
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,829
Then, why is it being done
for a week, in the whole year?

414
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,304
You ' re right, Vijay.

415
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:28,510
But, until the people are scared to
file complaints, ifs impossible.

416
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:30,904
That's why, we're doing
all this.

417
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:32,515
It will sort itself
out, gradually.

418
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:36,384
But, all police officers
aren't like you, sir.

419
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:40,058
Some are big, black bed bugs...

420
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:42,360
...who can only feed off
other people's blood.

421
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,275
What are you doing?

422
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,279
I'm digging a pit for
the compost.

423
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:07,882
You know what'? Compost and
speed post are <i>2</i> different things.

424
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:09,716
I know what compost means.

425
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:14,155
H' you bury dry leaves and organic
garbage for six months...

426
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,952
...it turns into fertilizer.

427
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,593
I learnt that in school.

428
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:21,761
I just came to tell you that...

429
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,631
mnext weekend on 2nd
and 3rd October...

430
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,535
...Swami Chinmayanand is holding
sermons in Panaji.

431
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,972
So'?
- So, we should go!

432
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:31,475
Ifs been a year since we heard
him preach. - You go ahead.

433
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,170
Either we go together, or nobody does.
- Mom!

434
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:35,736
I won't spare you! Mom can't save you.
- Mom!

435
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:37,278
Come here.
- Mom! No!

436
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,907
Come here.
- Anju.

437
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,141
We spent so much
to send you on a nature camp.

438
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:42,953
You didn't tell us about it.

439
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:45,646
It was great fun! There were
students from 4O schools.

440
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:48,749
We went sightseeing, had a bonfire,
we sang songs.

441
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:50,090
And we had a lot of fun.

442
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:52,494
There were kids from
VIP families too.

443
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:55,095
One of them was called Sam.

444
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:57,963
He used to keep shooting
videos of girls with his phone.

445
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:00,164
Did he shoot you, too'?

446
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,206
Yes.
- Why didn't you complain?

447
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,843
Later, an advocate's daughter
scolded him.

448
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:07,409
Then, he stopped it.

449
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:08,911
Which school was he from'?

450
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:10,104
St. Thomas.

451
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:23,355
Is this an old construction?
- Yes.

452
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,124
No wonder the foundation
has crumbled.

453
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:28,299
Don't worry, it will get done.

454
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:29,424
Ifs just a day's work.

455
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:32,026
Then, do it whenever you have time.
- Okay.

456
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:34,865
The slab laying work at the police
station is done.

457
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:37,164
I have to start the flooring
from Monday.

458
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:39,574
So, once that's done,
we'll get this done. Okay?

459
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:41,073
Okay, thank you.

460
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:45,909
I would have taken
the money from any other guy.

461
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:48,145
Mr. Plane, I'm sorry.

462
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:50,582
I have taken your money.

463
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,152
I will pay it back gradually.

464
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:55,090
Just give me a few days.

465
00:29:55,794 --> 00:30:00,163
What the heck, Rene'?
You think, you're too smart!

466
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:03,196
Did you get taken in by
some uneducated fool'?

467
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:08,701
Do you think, you'll be safe if you
complain to Mr. Prabhu about me'?

468
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,638
The money I have taken from you...

469
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,007
...included his cut, too.
Do you get that'?

470
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:17,881
He complained about me!

471
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:22,311
H' you do that, again, <i>I'll</i> make
sure you pack up!

472
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:24,788
Who are you threatening?

473
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,787
I know Mr. Prabhu really well.

474
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,593
He isn't like you.

475
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,852
Why are you asking me'?

476
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:32,658
I don't have to ask,
we all know you.

477
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:35,623
Listen, Vijay. I've had
enough of your sass.

478
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,962
Just zip it.
- Why should I?

479
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:40,735
Everyone knows you feed off more
on money, than you eat food.

480
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:44,042
What the heck...
- Hey, Gaitonde! Stop!

481
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:47,344
Okay, okay. Let me go.
Let go!

482
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:53,543
I won't spare you, Vijay.

483
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,816
We will settle up later.

484
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:58,088
<i>I'll</i> have my day.

485
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,452
Every dog has his day.

486
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:12,337
He came so defiantly, but, he's
leaving like a mouse!

487
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:15,138
Vijay, don't get into
trouble over me.

488
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:17,066
I will do the job and leave.

489
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:19,267
He's going to harass you
later for no reason.

490
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:21,675
Vijay, Gaitonde is a cop.

491
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:24,272
He has power.
Don't mess with him.

492
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,747
I didn't mess with him.

493
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,375
And I didn't lie.

494
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,486
Why are we so scared of cops'?

495
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:31,713
They are meant to serve us
and not the other way around.

496
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:35,821
"When the clouds rain down...

497
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:38,988
...I look at you to my
hearfs content."

498
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:45,002
"You are a prayer
for rain, to me."

499
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:47,395
Very good.

500
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:54,938
"Let me stay in your arms...

501
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:58,243
...let me go crazy for you".

502
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:03,753
"Let me suffer whatever you have
to give me, my love."

503
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:11,660
451.

504
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,694
452.

505
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:15,193
Jose.
- Hmm.

506
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,600
I've got a headache.
I'm going home. Understood?

507
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,238
Okay.
- He doesn't understand a thing.

508
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,740
H' ifs Sunny Leone,
you're bound to get a headache.

509
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:24,664
Dr. Joshi...

510
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:26,540
Rascal! He understands
everything.

511
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:38,615
Sometimes, I wonder.

512
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:43,018
Okay so, who made
you wonder today?

513
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:45,796
Let's go in, <i>I'll</i> tell you.

514
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:48,195
No, tell me or
I won't let you in.

515
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,328
Come on, you can't do that.
- Tell me.

516
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,299
Sunny Leone? Right'?

517
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:58,365
Jism <i>2</i> or Jackpot?

518
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:00,572
Jackpot.

519
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:11,321
You're now a dad,
but you still act like a kid.

520
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:15,122
I'm not a kid.
I'm young.

521
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:32,070
Good morning, dad.
- Good morning.

522
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,337
Good morning.

523
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:39,206
Dad, did you come home,
last night'?

524
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,111
Yes, dear.
- Why?

525
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:43,954
Anu, don't ask nosy questions.

526
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:48,292
Why? Dad comes home,
very rarely, so I asked.

527
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:50,960
Don't ask too many questions.
Don't you have to go to school?

528
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:52,493
You're not even wearing
your uniforms, yet.

529
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,324
Come on, dad!
How could you forget'?

530
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,660
What?
- It's a holiday, today.

531
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:58,964
Did the school declare
that, or did you do that'?

532
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:01,901
Our daughters make excuses
expertly.

533
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:04,403
Ifs Sunday tomorrow.
Why do you have a holiday today?

534
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:06,234
Ifs Gandhi Jayanti today.

535
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:09,073
So'? Go and study.

536
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:11,179
No, dad. I am going to play.

537
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:16,052
These kids...

538
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:19,050
Won't you bathe, today?

539
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:21,992
I don't want to.

540
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:24,791
So, who's going to work?

541
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:26,925
I don't know.

542
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:30,297
I ran out of stamina yesterday.

543
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,031
I mean, that...

544
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:38,903
...my bike broke down on the way.
So, I had to push it home.

545
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:40,269
I got tired.

546
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:42,371
Anju.

547
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,179
<i>I'll</i> give you a list.
Get some things from the market.

548
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:48,749
Okay. Can I go in the evening,
please?

549
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:50,717
Alright, but don't forget.

550
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:07,199
Anju. Remember me'?
lfs Sam.

551
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:12,499
Yes, I do. But, what are you
doing here?

552
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:16,275
Me'? I came to meet you.

553
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:18,371
Me'?
- Hmm.

554
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:20,082
Why?

555
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:24,956
Finish it. Okay?
- Hmm.

556
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,156
See who's at the door.
- Okay.

557
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,092
Hi, Anju.

558
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:56,318
Don't worry. I didn't
show this video to anyone.

559
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:59,821
In fact, I'm thinking of
deleting it.

560
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:02,650
You want that, too, right'?

561
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:07,129
Great! Make my wish
come true.

562
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:10,998
Tonight at 11 pm,
behind your house.

563
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:12,966
You'll meet me, right'?

564
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:15,465
No! I won't come there.

565
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,532
I didn't show this video to anyone.
Not even my friends.

566
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:22,207
I didn't forward it or think
of uploading it on the net.

567
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:27,474
But, just think about it.
What if I do all that'?

568
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,252
What about your 'family's reputation?

569
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:34,084
Sam, please, Sam!

570
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:36,082
Please, delete this video.

571
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,787
Why are you hassling me'?
Please!

572
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,456
I will do it.
Tonight at 11 pm.

573
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:42,130
Behind your house.

574
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,959
Alone .
Alright?

575
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,564
<i>I'll</i> see you.
- No, Sam!

576
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:48,329
<i>I'll</i> see you.
- Sam!

577
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:51,299
Sam, please!
Sam!

578
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,673
Sam!

579
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,356
What is it'?

580
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,493
I've a slight headache.

581
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:14,827
Do you want some medicine?

582
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:17,467
No. <i>I'll</i> be fine, once I lie
down for a bit.

583
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:19,796
Eat something.
It's almost dinner 'time.

584
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:36,283
Run! Rum
<i>'</i> No! <i>'</i>

585
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:38,582
Run,

586
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:40,756
It seems, a storm is coming.

587
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:42,315
Hey, don't jinx it!

588
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:44,585
I'm leaving.

589
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:46,991
Got an umbrella?
- Yes.

590
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:23,667
Anju, you shouldn't have
done this.

591
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:26,302
I guess, you aren't
taking me seriously.

592
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:30,872
Sam, please!
Don't harass me anymore.

593
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,676
Please, delete the video.
- Should I delete it'?

594
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:36,370
You cheated me.
- No, Sam.

595
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:37,778
Just you wait.

596
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:40,109
Why are you doing this?

597
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:42,710
We didn't harm you in any way.

598
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,614
I request you...

599
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:47,653
...don't ruin her life.

600
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,255
Ifs no use, now.

601
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:52,795
She was ruined the day
I shot this video.

602
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:56,194
You've seen it today.

603
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,895
Soon, everyone on the internet
will watch it.

604
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:04,472
They'll know how she bathes.

605
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:12,145
I request you.
Please delete it.

606
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:13,909
I won't do that.

607
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:16,813
Don't you have any shame?

608
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:19,818
Delete it.
- No.

609
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:22,159
Please, delete it.

610
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:24,125
I told you, I won't do it.

611
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:54,790
I beg you.
Please, delete it.

612
00:39:56,861 --> 00:40:00,764
We'll be ruined!
Please!

613
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:05,726
Alright.

614
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:09,597
I will delete the video.

615
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:14,140
But, you must give me
what I want.

616
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,242
What'?

617
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,195
Anju.

618
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:39,500
Nandini!

619
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:42,635
Ahju!

620
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:43,999
An...

621
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,011
Dad!

622
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,379
Anju, what happened?

623
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:56,049
Aniu?

624
00:40:58,255 --> 00:40:59,620
Nandini, what happened?

625
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:03,318
Why doesn't someone tell me'?

626
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:14,303
I will delete the video.

627
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:18,836
But, you must give me...

628
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:22,545
...what I want.

629
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:33,990
Or, I will...

630
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,023
...upload this video online.

631
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:03,615
Ahju!

632
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:07,553
Ahju!

633
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:11,523
Anju, he's not breathing!

634
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:16,729
Sam! Sam!

635
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:18,661
Sam?

636
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,002
What happened?
- Mom, I can't get through to dad.

637
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,407
I guess, the line is dead...

638
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:04,245
Let's go.
Come with me.

639
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:03,701
Anju, get the spade.

640
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:04,632
What will we do, now'?

641
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:06,500
I don't know.

642
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:11,303
I don't know how I got
the courage, to bury him.

643
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:15,278
But, I'm shaking all over, now.

644
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:19,173
Did I make a mistake
by burying him?

645
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:21,908
No.

646
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:23,648
You did the right thing.

647
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:27,655
No... if we had informed the
police at once...

648
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:29,654
...we wouldn't feel scared.

649
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,658
H' we'd gone to the police...

650
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:35,125
...Anju's life
would be ruined.

651
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,061
I'm really scared!

652
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:45,298
Don't be scared. I won't let
anything happen to you.

653
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:49,372
See what I found
in the Outhouse.

654
00:45:50,848 --> 00:45:52,282
Did Sam have a car'?

655
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:55,477
Yes, he had a yellow car.

656
00:45:57,221 --> 00:45:59,451
He must have parked it nearby.

657
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,085
Have you checked the
Outhouse, properly?

658
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:04,157
No.
- No.

659
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:05,854
Let's go.

660
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:18,167
Where did Sam fall when you
hit him'?

661
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:20,240
Right there.

662
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,950
What are you searching for'?

663
00:46:30,854 --> 00:46:33,619
Blood. There's not a single
drop of blood here.

664
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:38,720
When you hit him with the
stick, did you hit his head?

665
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:44,328
Perhaps, ifs an internal
injury.

666
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,800
We have to clean the
Outhouse, thoroughly.

667
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:01,482
Just a moment.

668
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:07,924
Trace it, quickly!

669
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,254
As soon as the SIM card is put in...

670
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:11,158
Trace it 'fast.
- Trace 'the location oi 'the SIM card.

671
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:13,628
Find out where he's travelling.
- We are getting the signal.

672
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:15,131
Ifs really easy to trace his
SIM now.

673
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,462
I've traced it, sir.

674
00:47:16,533 --> 00:47:18,831
He's talking from the second floor.
- And he's travelling to Pune.

675
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:20,802
Sir, if he speaks for five minutes,
we'll have the exact location.

676
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:23,033
The SIM card has been activated.
So, the exact location...

677
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,574
Trace the SIM card.
- Sir, ifs within a half...

678
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,006
...kilometer radius.

679
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:27,771
I guess
he threw the mobile away.

680
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:30,910
Sir, he's traveling via Rajasthan
to Haryana.

681
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:47,528
Don't leave the house
until I get back.

682
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,264
Don't call anyone.

683
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:51,665
Keep the doors and
windows locked.

684
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:55,161
It should appear as if no
one is at home.

685
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,470
Where are you going?

686
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,566
I have to find the car and
take it somewhere else.

687
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:01,537
Get back, soon.

688
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:08,213
Anju!
- I didn't mean to kill Sam.

689
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:11,653
I was just trying to
break his phone.

690
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:14,656
But, he didn't let go...
- I know. I know!

691
00:48:15,325 --> 00:48:17,885
I don't want to go to prison!
Please.

692
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:19,429
Are you crazy?

693
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:21,832
I'm still alive.

694
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:24,101
I won't let you go to jail.

695
00:48:25,702 --> 00:48:26,726
Nothing will happen to you.

696
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:44,144
Salvi, stop counting and
give all oi that 'to me.

697
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:52,326
Is that all you've got'?

698
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,488
Sir, isn't Rs. 500 enough?

699
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:03,163
Ifs not for a driver's license.
This is for passport verification.

700
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:06,241
You want to go to London
to meet your son, right'?

701
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,646
How much for you?
- Sir, ifs fifty five.

702
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:18,650
Do you think, ifs raining money?
Fifty five, it seems!

703
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:27,128
Here, that's thirty.

704
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:28,854
Get going.

705
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:30,664
Alright, then.

706
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:32,665
Get me a gift from London.

707
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:40,203
What the heck?
Who is it'?

708
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:51,076
Isn't that Vijay Salgaonkar'?

709
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,417
It seems to be.

710
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,218
When did he buy a car'?

711
00:49:54,591 --> 00:49:55,820
Where does he live'?

712
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:02,523
His garden is across the road.

713
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,119
Mom.

714
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:31,354
We'll be in big trouble,
because of me. Right'?

715
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:35,124
Don't say that.

716
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:37,632
We are with you.

717
00:50:39,436 --> 00:50:43,395
You don't know,
whose son he was.

718
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:46,443
Whose son was he'?

719
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:36,521
Listen, I wanted to tell you...

720
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:38,594
...on the next weekend on
the 2nd and 3rd of October...

721
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:41,654
...Swami Chinmayanand
is holding a sermon at Panaji.

722
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:48,365
Come on, now!

723
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:51,405
Hey, move it!

724
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:38,484
Yes, sir'?
- Can I buy a phone?

725
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:40,620
A new one?
- No, a used phone.

726
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:41,816
Sure.

727
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:44,451
Please make sure the battery
is fully charged. - Sure.

728
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:48,529
Here you are, sir.

729
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:50,200
How much for this?
- Rs. 900.

730
00:53:02,145 --> 00:53:04,910
Here you are.
- Could you put the SIM card in'?

731
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:17,085
Here you are, sir.
- Thank you.

732
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:24,197
How do I reduce the volume?

733
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:25,830
Here.

734
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:28,904
Ifs done, sir.
- Thank you.

735
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:30,231
You're welcome.

736
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:57,125
There is a stone quarry, about
15 kms away in Paavelim.

737
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,762
I mean, it used to be there.

738
00:54:58,928 --> 00:55:00,760
We got it shut down,
after protesting against it.

739
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,991
There is a lake right in
the middle of it.

740
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:08,237
But, the project is
not eco friendly.

741
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:26,768
Ifs you! I thought, you'd
taken a holiday.

742
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:28,233
What happened, today?

743
00:57:28,411 --> 00:57:30,277
Nothing much.
I collected the payments.

744
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:33,111
As always, Mrs. Pereira avoided
making the payment.

745
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,885
Okay, listen to me.

746
00:57:36,553 --> 00:57:39,716
I am not here for <i>2</i> days.
I am going to Panaji for a sermon.

747
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:41,816
Sermons?

748
00:57:42,325 --> 00:57:43,815
Nandini really wants to go.

749
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:46,125
We are leaving, tomorrow.

750
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:47,690
Take care of things.

751
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,194
Mr. Vijay.

752
00:57:51,868 --> 00:57:53,336
Anything wrong'?

753
00:57:55,238 --> 00:57:56,171
Not at all.
Why?

754
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:59,174
Well, you just seem slightly
'off. That's all.

755
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:03,404
Not at all!

756
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:06,014
But, if I find out, that
you've messed up...

757
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:07,374
...I'll rub you out!

758
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:08,779
Now, that's more like you.

759
00:58:08,885 --> 00:58:11,252
Get lost. Don't screen too many
adult films.

760
00:58:12,055 --> 00:58:13,489
Sure.

761
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:41,614
Who is it'?

762
00:58:41,718 --> 00:58:43,049
Ifs Vii-EV-

763
00:58:54,898 --> 00:58:55,922
Don't cry, dear.

764
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:57,533
I'm back.

765
00:58:58,635 --> 00:59:02,003
Dad, don't ever leave me again.

766
00:59:02,171 --> 00:59:03,400
I won't.

767
00:59:03,907 --> 00:59:05,136
Vi] 8y -

768
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:07,707
Sam was 'the son oi 'the
IG oi Goa.

769
00:59:09,112 --> 00:59:10,944
Inspector General of Police.

770
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,149
You're lying!

771
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:20,750
Tell me!

772
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:27,594
<i>Pat“!</i>

773
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:52,947
Senior Inspector D'souza.

774
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:55,218
And Inspector Mohite.

775
00:59:56,826 --> 00:59:59,318
These are the name of
the suspended officers.

776
01:00:02,031 --> 01:00:03,362
Because of whom'?

777
01:00:06,135 --> 01:00:08,661
The court warned the
police department.

778
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:12,164
They may set up an enquiry, too.

779
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:14,540
Because of whom'?

780
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:19,280
The murderer in this case is
roaming soot free.

781
01:00:20,817 --> 01:00:21,943
Because of whom'?

782
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:26,047
Because, both of you
testified in court...

783
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:29,357
...that, the police forced you
to make a statement.

784
01:00:32,862 --> 01:00:35,763
Do you think, the police department
is a joke?

785
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:39,728
And you can do anything
you want'?

786
01:00:45,908 --> 01:00:47,899
I want you to give another
statement.

787
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:50,677
This time, make it the truth.

788
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:52,205
No, ma'am.

789
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:54,274
Ma'am, they will kill us.

790
01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:57,119
They will kill you and so
you won't testify.

791
01:00:58,254 --> 01:01:00,951
And so, both my officers
will stay under suspension.

792
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:05,289
Patil.
- Yes, Madam.

793
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:08,760
Did anyone see you
when you fetched them'?

794
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:10,800
No, Madam. We were in civil
clothes.

795
01:01:15,938 --> 01:01:17,167
Alright, then.

796
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:20,900
String them both up
with a noose around their necks.

797
01:01:22,278 --> 01:01:25,077
Anchor them with a heavy stone
and toss them into the sea.

798
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:28,316
No one will know.
The corpses won't be found.

799
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:32,116
I won't waste my time on them.

800
01:01:35,124 --> 01:01:36,990
No, ma'am!

801
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:39,087
Ma'am. We'll tell the truth.

802
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,693
Ma'am, they are innocent.

803
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:42,455
We will tell the truth.

804
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:47,093
Patil, when they come to
testify in the court...

805
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:48,660
...bring in their families.

806
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:49,961
Okay, Madam.

807
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:53,566
It they give a false testimony,
maim their families.

808
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:55,707
I don't care.

809
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:36,480
Why are you smiling?

810
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:39,013
Aren't you tensed?
- About what'?

811
01:02:39,455 --> 01:02:40,786
That boy...

812
01:02:41,023 --> 01:02:42,218
Which boy?

813
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:44,887
Sam.
- Who's Sam?

814
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:47,420
The one who...
- Just a moment.

815
01:02:49,465 --> 01:02:51,399
I don't know anyone called Sam.

816
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:54,001
And no boy entered this house.

817
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:57,300
From now on, we are
going to react just like that.

818
01:02:57,373 --> 01:02:58,772
As if nothing happened.

819
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:02,803
Or the fear and tension
may cause problems for us.

820
01:03:04,213 --> 01:03:07,672
I just realized that
a while back.

821
01:03:08,151 --> 01:03:09,915
Before I arrived home,
I went to the office.

822
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,720
Jose asked me
if anything was wrong.

823
01:03:14,257 --> 01:03:17,955
H' Jose can figure out something
is wrong in a few moments...

824
01:03:18,928 --> 01:03:20,919
...then, others can
figure it out, too.

825
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:25,595
But, when I answered him as
I normally do, he was assured.

826
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:29,667
So, forget what happened.

827
01:03:30,173 --> 01:03:32,801
Behave as if nothing
has happened.

828
01:03:33,242 --> 01:03:34,334
Everything is normal.

829
01:03:34,877 --> 01:03:38,142
What did you do about the car'?

830
01:03:38,214 --> 01:03:40,512
I won't tell you stuff...

831
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:42,809
mthat you don't need to
know about.

832
01:03:42,885 --> 01:03:44,751
Don't even try to find out.

833
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:49,119
Pack your bags.

834
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:51,227
We leave tomorrow morning.

835
01:03:51,861 --> 01:03:53,090
Where to'?

836
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:54,960
We have to stay somewhere
else for two days.

837
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:58,964
It'll be a good change
and help us relax.

838
01:04:00,269 --> 01:04:02,761
H' anyone asks you
where we're going, tell them...

839
01:04:03,472 --> 01:04:06,100
...we are going to attend
Swami Chinmayanands sermon.

840
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:08,768
But, that got over today.

841
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:31,830
Hello!
- Hi, Mahesh.

842
01:04:32,134 --> 01:04:35,502
Are you going back or...
- Yes, <i>I'll</i> freshen up and go back.

843
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,504
Meera, did you speak to Sam?

844
01:04:38,841 --> 01:04:41,105
I've been trying to call since last
night. His phone is switched off.

845
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:44,574
You call him constantly
and bother him, Mahesh.

846
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:47,206
So, he must have switched it off
on purpose.

847
01:04:47,316 --> 01:04:49,910
That's nice. You're scolding
me for all my trouble.

848
01:04:50,586 --> 01:04:52,953
You've allowed him to take
too many liberties.

849
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:57,057
Mahesh, kids want freedom
at this age.

850
01:04:57,126 --> 01:04:58,787
We must give it to them.

851
01:04:58,961 --> 01:05:01,896
Freedom? How much
freedom does he want'?

852
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:03,392
We have given him everything.

853
01:05:03,466 --> 01:05:05,730
A phone, laptop, <i>2</i> credit cards,
a car.

854
01:05:05,801 --> 01:05:07,064
Why does he need all that'?

855
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:10,997
Have you seen last month's
credit card bill'? Rs. 60,000.

856
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,841
Yes, that's because, he bought
a new laptop.

857
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:15,600
And I've seen the receipt.

858
01:05:15,678 --> 01:05:17,203
Why does he need another
laptop?

859
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:19,472
How does the receipt matter?
Did you see the laptop?

860
01:05:19,548 --> 01:05:20,845
I haven't seen it.

861
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:23,484
Mahesh, stop doubting your
son so much.

862
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:25,651
He'll run away forever,
some day.

863
01:05:26,055 --> 01:05:28,251
I don't doubt him.
I worry about him, Meera.

864
01:05:28,491 --> 01:05:30,755
You're pampered him
to such an extent that...

865
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,752
Sorry. I'm getting late.
Okay?

866
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:37,300
H' you speak to him,
tell him to come home. Okay?

867
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,090
Bye Meera.
- Bye.

868
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:53,410
Alright, tickets, please.

869
01:05:53,516 --> 01:05:55,006
Mr. Salgaonkar!

870
01:05:55,084 --> 01:05:57,143
Are you going on a trip
with the family?

871
01:05:58,054 --> 01:05:59,385
Did you buy a new bus?

872
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:01,954
No, it's a used bus.
- It's nice.

873
01:06:02,058 --> 01:06:03,548
Where are you off to'?

874
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:06,755
We are going to attend our
spiritual guru's sermon at Panaji.

875
01:06:07,263 --> 01:06:10,096
Give me four tickets.
- What's wrong with you?

876
01:06:10,766 --> 01:06:13,565
I can't let you pay tor
tickets on my bus.

877
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,836
Put it away.
- Thank you.

878
01:06:15,905 --> 01:06:18,272
Alright, tickets, please!

879
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:19,968
Tickets!

880
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:27,712
"Dying every moment.

881
01:06:29,919 --> 01:06:34,550
"...living for the moment."

882
01:06:37,026 --> 01:06:42,328
"Barely alive..."

883
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:49,800
" It's stifling . . . "

884
01:06:52,942 --> 01:06:59,040
" It's stifling . . . "

885
01:06:59,148 --> 01:07:02,209
"I'm in pain."

886
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:08,280
" It's stifling . . . "

887
01:07:08,391 --> 01:07:11,588
"Fear picks at my mind."

888
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:17,793
" It's stifling . . . "

889
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:23,805
"Dying every moment,
living for the moment."

890
01:07:24,106 --> 01:07:25,699
"Barely alive..."

891
01:07:25,775 --> 01:07:31,805
" It's stifling . . . "

892
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:37,843
" It's stifling . . . "

893
01:07:50,633 --> 01:07:56,333
" It's stifling . . . "

894
01:07:56,439 --> 01:08:03,641
"My lips ravaged,
I can barely speak."

895
01:08:05,714 --> 01:08:12,950
"Bloodless limbs,
my body is drifting aimlessly."

896
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:21,727
"The tears
caught up in my heart..."

897
01:08:21,797 --> 01:08:23,390
"...my eyes glaze over with tears."

898
01:08:23,466 --> 01:08:29,462
" It's stifling . . . "

899
01:08:29,538 --> 01:08:35,671
" It's stifling . . . "

900
01:08:45,187 --> 01:08:51,024
" It's stifling . . . "

901
01:08:51,093 --> 01:08:58,659
"Why do I feel someone
watching me from a distance?"

902
01:09:00,402 --> 01:09:04,339
"Did anyone come near me?"

903
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:11,503
"Does my shadow follow me?"

904
01:09:13,215 --> 01:09:20,849
"But, my heart beat is
subdued."

905
01:09:20,923 --> 01:09:22,687
"Barely breathing..."

906
01:09:22,758 --> 01:09:28,390
" It's stifling . . . "

907
01:09:28,797 --> 01:09:34,736
" It's stifling . . . "

908
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:38,099
"My breath catches
ever so slightly."

909
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:44,079
" It's stifling . . . "

910
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:47,372
"Why is every
moment stifling me?"

911
01:09:47,483 --> 01:09:53,616
" It's stifling . . . "

912
01:09:53,722 --> 01:09:56,885
" It's stifling . . . "

913
01:09:59,628 --> 01:10:01,153
What did I say to you?

914
01:10:01,597 --> 01:10:03,497
I know, but I can't seem to forget.

915
01:10:03,832 --> 01:10:05,322
You have to forget.

916
01:10:05,935 --> 01:10:09,030
Our fear is the one last piece
of evidence of what happened.

917
01:10:09,772 --> 01:10:11,262
We have to get rid ot that
as well.

918
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,301
And there's just one
more thing.

919
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:16,504
Get a bill for everything
you buy, from now on.

920
01:10:16,979 --> 01:10:19,004
Groceries, vegetables,
fruits, pencils.

921
01:10:19,081 --> 01:10:20,412
Get bills tor the
most trivial things.

922
01:10:20,516 --> 01:10:27,946
"It is stifling..."

923
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:31,083
"It is stifling..."

924
01:10:31,193 --> 01:10:34,219
"My breath catches
ever so slightly."

925
01:10:34,296 --> 01:10:40,429
"It is stifling..."

926
01:10:40,502 --> 01:10:43,528
"Why is every
moment stifling me?"

927
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:47,803
"It is stifling..."

928
01:10:47,876 --> 01:10:49,844
Let me speak to Kanvinde from
the cyber cell.

929
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:55,248
"It is stifling..."

930
01:11:48,937 --> 01:11:53,534
"Dying every moment.

931
01:11:55,911 --> 01:12:01,145
"...living for the moment."

932
01:12:03,085 --> 01:12:07,716
"Barely alive..."

933
01:12:09,591 --> 01:12:15,758
"It is stifling..."

934
01:12:18,934 --> 01:12:25,032
"It is stifling..."

935
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:28,201
"I'm in pain."

936
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:34,306
"It is stifling..."

937
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:37,546
"Fear picks at my mind."

938
01:12:37,653 --> 01:12:43,854
"It is stifling..."

939
01:12:43,926 --> 01:12:49,831
"Dying every moment,
living for the moment."

940
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:54,160
Ma'am, we followed Sam's network
from Goa, Hublidarbar, Chittadurg...

941
01:12:54,269 --> 01:12:58,137
...Bengaluru, to Tamil Nadu
and we lost trace in Kanchipuram.

942
01:12:58,507 --> 01:13:00,635
After that, his phone was
switched off.

943
01:13:02,644 --> 01:13:05,739
He has friends in Bengaluru
and Chennai.

944
01:13:06,014 --> 01:13:07,413
Yes, perhaps, he went there.

945
01:13:07,516 --> 01:13:10,645
But, why did the phone get switched
off in Kanchipuram'?

946
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:16,214
"It is stifling..."

947
01:13:16,291 --> 01:13:23,721
"Why do I feel someone
watching me from a distance?"

948
01:13:25,601 --> 01:13:30,300
"Did anyone come near me?"

949
01:13:31,807 --> 01:13:36,540
"Does my shadow follow me?"

950
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:46,046
"But, my heart beat is
subdued."

951
01:13:46,155 --> 01:13:47,782
"Barely breathing..."

952
01:13:47,856 --> 01:13:53,795
" It's stifling . . . "

953
01:13:54,029 --> 01:13:59,934
" It's stifling . . . "

954
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:06,436
"It is stifling..."

955
01:14:06,508 --> 01:14:12,345
"It is stifling..."

956
01:14:12,714 --> 01:14:17,379
"It is stifling..."

957
01:14:49,918 --> 01:14:51,079
ACP Rego.

958
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:52,620
Yes, ma'am.

959
01:14:53,422 --> 01:14:55,083
Ma'am, we just found
the car here.

960
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:56,680
Who saw it, first'?

961
01:14:56,758 --> 01:14:59,227
A few kids who were swimming
here, found it.

962
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:04,564
How many days, do you reckon?

963
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:07,635
Ifs been about <i>2</i> weeks.

964
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:11,638
Excuse me, did you find anything
in the lake?

965
01:15:11,707 --> 01:15:13,698
No, sir. Don't worry.

966
01:15:14,476 --> 01:15:16,672
When the car was dumped,
it was empty.

967
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,415
Don't let this
get to the media.

968
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:24,008
Wrap it UP-

969
01:15:26,788 --> 01:15:28,722
The last call from Sam's mobile...

970
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:31,851
...was made on 2nd October
at 07:12 pm.

971
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:35,422
The signal indicates, that it was
located in Pondolem.

972
01:15:35,731 --> 01:15:38,757
His phone went out of
coverage at 10:30 pm.

973
01:15:39,468 --> 01:15:40,731
The next morning...

974
01:15:40,802 --> 01:15:44,363
...his phone was switched on
once again at Panaji at 9:25 am.

975
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:47,172
After that, the phone
went to Kanchipuram.

976
01:15:47,276 --> 01:15:49,267
Where it was switched off.

977
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:53,648
Ma'am, given the information
we have so far, I think...

978
01:15:54,016 --> 01:15:56,849
...we should confine our
investigation to Goa.

979
01:15:57,185 --> 01:15:58,550
For the time being.

980
01:15:59,688 --> 01:16:04,057
Sam spoke to someone for
the last time on 2nd October.

981
01:16:04,359 --> 01:16:06,589
Get me the details tor that number.
- Yes, ma'am.

982
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:10,799
Yes? Send him in.

983
01:16:17,806 --> 01:16:19,865
Ma'am, the account number
you gave us...

984
01:16:19,975 --> 01:16:22,672
...was accessed at 10:00 am
on 2nd October...

985
01:16:22,778 --> 01:16:25,247
...at a cash ATM in Panaji.

986
01:16:25,347 --> 01:16:27,008
There is no transaction
after that.

987
01:16:28,016 --> 01:16:29,142
How much cash was withdrawn'?

988
01:16:29,217 --> 01:16:31,652
Rs. 20,000, sir.
- Rs. 20,000'?

989
01:16:33,388 --> 01:16:35,186
Why did he need so much money?

990
01:16:35,457 --> 01:16:36,925
Sir, there's more.

991
01:16:37,225 --> 01:16:40,286
The phone which went out of
range on 2nd October...

992
01:16:40,395 --> 01:16:43,558
...and the one which was switched
on, the morning of 3rd October...

993
01:16:43,832 --> 01:16:45,630
mare two different phones.

994
01:16:46,735 --> 01:16:48,965
The IMEI numbers are different.

995
01:16:49,404 --> 01:16:54,934
Ma'am, possibly he withdrew
cash to buy a new cell phone.

996
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:58,046
I don't think so.

997
01:16:58,146 --> 01:17:01,411
He bought a new cell phone
just two months ago.

998
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:05,151
I think, our son is in
big trouble.

999
01:17:10,692 --> 01:17:11,488
Sir.

1000
01:17:16,765 --> 01:17:18,790
Hey, you.
What's this?

1001
01:17:21,403 --> 01:17:23,098
The Panchayat building tax.

1002
01:17:23,171 --> 01:17:24,935
I told you to pay that, right'?

1003
01:17:26,008 --> 01:17:28,602
When did I tell you?
- It was...

1004
01:17:28,677 --> 01:17:31,237
Three weeks ago.
- Three weeks?

1005
01:17:31,546 --> 01:17:35,380
Sameer Deshmukh, the only son of
IG Meera Deshmukh.

1006
01:17:35,851 --> 01:17:37,341
He's been missing since
3 weeks.

1007
01:17:38,086 --> 01:17:41,579
According to the phone records,
he was in Pondolem on 2nd October.

1008
01:17:43,725 --> 01:17:46,592
This is the car, he drove in
here.

1009
01:17:47,262 --> 01:17:51,631
A yellow Hyundai Getz,
GA07, MJ 1011.

1010
01:17:58,106 --> 01:18:00,803
This car was recovered from
the lake at Paavelim Stone Quarry.

1011
01:18:01,009 --> 01:18:02,670
But, there is no sign of Sameer.

1012
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:26,969
H' you are facing a problem,
come to me and...

1013
01:18:29,604 --> 01:18:30,765
What's up, Digambar?

1014
01:18:31,173 --> 01:18:33,005
How is your son, now'?
- He's fine, sir.

1015
01:18:33,108 --> 01:18:34,803
He will be discharged
within a day or two.

1016
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:36,139
That's good.

1017
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:37,406
Give me Rs. 200.

1018
01:18:37,512 --> 01:18:38,809
I don't have any money.

1019
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,075
What do you mean, you
don't have money?

1020
01:18:40,182 --> 01:18:42,378
The hospital isn't treating
your son free oi charge.

1021
01:18:42,484 --> 01:18:43,713
No, no...
- Come on, outwith it.

1022
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:45,378
What's in that pocket?
- It's nothing.

1023
01:18:45,487 --> 01:18:47,114
Let's see it!
Is that all'?

1024
01:18:47,956 --> 01:18:49,856
Fifty rupees?
Get going.

1025
01:18:54,096 --> 01:18:55,996
Martin, give me a packet
of Pan Masala.

1026
01:18:56,498 --> 01:18:58,398
What'? The Pan masala'?

1027
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,261
No tea for you today, Mr. Gaitonde'?

1028
01:19:00,669 --> 01:19:03,468
No, I don't have time for tea.

1029
01:19:04,039 --> 01:19:06,303
I've been assigned
to a major case.

1030
01:19:06,975 --> 01:19:08,101
What is it about'?

1031
01:19:08,176 --> 01:19:10,770
A yellow Hyundai Getz car...

1032
01:19:11,213 --> 01:19:13,580
...was recovered from the lake in
Paavelim stone quarry.

1033
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:25,023
That's in Paavelim, right'?
Why do you have to get involved?

1034
01:19:25,393 --> 01:19:27,555
Ifs true but, I can't help it.

1035
01:19:27,963 --> 01:19:30,057
The lGfls office called, directly.

1036
01:19:30,565 --> 01:19:33,296
The car belongs 'to
'the son oi 'the IG, you see.

1037
01:19:34,236 --> 01:19:37,171
The IG will obviously employ
the entire police force to work.

1038
01:19:38,673 --> 01:19:41,108
Mr. Sawant and I are working
on this case together.

1039
01:19:41,343 --> 01:19:42,674
<i>I'll</i> leave, now.

1040
01:19:43,011 --> 01:19:44,206
What do you care'?

1041
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:50,815
Mr. Sawant.

1042
01:20:00,395 --> 01:20:03,330
What's wrong'? Everything okay?
- Yes, of course.

1043
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:05,399
Gaitonde, don't shoot your
mouth off.

1044
01:20:05,767 --> 01:20:08,793
Don't drag Vijay into this, just
because you have issues with him.

1045
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:13,032
I saw him getting into the car.
lfs just...

1046
01:20:18,213 --> 01:20:19,647
That's not all.

1047
01:20:19,848 --> 01:20:23,478
A little while ago, I mentioned the car.
He was disturbed.

1048
01:20:23,985 --> 01:20:25,180
You'll see...

1049
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:28,685
...even if he is slightly
apprehensive, he will look back.

1050
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:40,999
He's going to turn, now.

1051
01:20:55,383 --> 01:20:56,680
So, now what'?

1052
01:20:58,753 --> 01:21:00,380
You've lost it, Gaitonde.

1053
01:21:03,992 --> 01:21:07,087
Vijay Salgaonkar and the lGfls
son, Sameer Deshmukh...

1054
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:08,519
What's the connection?

1055
01:21:08,597 --> 01:21:11,464
Sir, Gaitonde and Vijay
can't stand each other.

1056
01:21:11,733 --> 01:21:14,430
That's why, Gaitonde is trying
to implicate Vijay.

1057
01:21:14,636 --> 01:21:17,105
Or he is mistaken.

1058
01:21:18,974 --> 01:21:19,964
Sir.

1059
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:24,679
Sir, on the 3rd of this month
at 7:15 am...

1060
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:27,847
...I went to Subhash Salvis place
for passport verification.

1061
01:21:29,417 --> 01:21:31,818
I saw Vijay Salgaonkar there.

1062
01:21:33,355 --> 01:21:35,016
I am absolutely sure.

1063
01:21:35,857 --> 01:21:38,485
Where were you on the afternoon of
the 2nd of this month'?

1064
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:41,295
We went for a sermon to Panaji.

1065
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:44,594
When did you get back?
- The next day, on a Sunday.

1066
01:21:44,766 --> 01:21:47,827
At what time'?
- In the evening.

1067
01:21:48,169 --> 01:21:50,160
Where was the sermon held?
- In Panaji.

1068
01:21:50,405 --> 01:21:51,634
Where, in Panaji'?

1069
01:21:54,009 --> 01:21:55,340
Patio...

1070
01:21:57,579 --> 01:21:58,671
In Patio colony.

1071
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:02,012
Really? Was it in Patio colony?

1072
01:22:04,686 --> 01:22:07,212
The hermitage is there.
That's where the sermon was held.

1073
01:22:07,522 --> 01:22:09,115
Vijay, what's going on?

1074
01:22:10,025 --> 01:22:11,618
Will the police
actually come here?

1075
01:22:11,826 --> 01:22:12,918
Absolutely.

1076
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:14,994
We don't know when
they will come.

1077
01:22:15,497 --> 01:22:16,931
But, they will certainly come over.

1078
01:22:17,432 --> 01:22:19,457
But, you don't have to worry.

1079
01:22:19,801 --> 01:22:22,498
The police has no clues
about Sam.

1080
01:22:23,138 --> 01:22:24,628
And, they don't have any evidence
either.

1081
01:22:24,973 --> 01:22:29,035
But, they will try to
gather evidence.

1082
01:22:29,711 --> 01:22:32,408
So, they will cross question you.

1083
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:36,850
Either they will ask nicely
or they will scare you.

1084
01:22:37,218 --> 01:22:41,212
Your mom and I may be
beaten up, before you.

1085
01:22:42,757 --> 01:22:46,785
But, if they don't get the answers
they want, they'll let us go.

1086
01:22:48,196 --> 01:22:50,961
So no matter what happens...
anything at all...

1087
01:22:52,767 --> 01:22:55,065
...you can't change your statement
under any circumstances.

1088
01:22:55,837 --> 01:22:57,464
Just stick to your story.

1089
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,638
Can you both do that'?

1090
01:23:01,943 --> 01:23:05,971
Dad, will they beat you
and mom up very badly?

1091
01:23:07,182 --> 01:23:08,741
Don't think about that.

1092
01:23:09,751 --> 01:23:12,482
When you are naughty,
I hit you too, right'?

1093
01:23:12,787 --> 01:23:14,016
That's about it.

1094
01:23:15,357 --> 01:23:16,620
Don't be scared.

1095
01:23:17,292 --> 01:23:19,260
Ifs late.
Go to bed.

1096
01:23:19,694 --> 01:23:21,628
Good night.
- Good night.

1097
01:23:27,435 --> 01:23:31,599
Vijay, how are we going to prove
we weren't here on Saturday?

1098
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:35,476
Someone must have seen you at
the office or at Martin's corner.

1099
01:23:39,247 --> 01:23:41,545
Of course, they must have.
- Then what'?

1100
01:23:41,649 --> 01:23:43,845
Nandini, what happened to us...

1101
01:23:44,753 --> 01:23:47,085
...has left us with only
two options.

1102
01:23:48,523 --> 01:23:50,355
Either we give in...

1103
01:23:51,092 --> 01:23:52,719
...or we stand up and fight.

1104
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:55,990
I don't think, we've done
anything wrong.

1105
01:23:56,931 --> 01:23:59,229
So, there's no way
I'm going to give in.

1106
01:24:00,168 --> 01:24:01,795
We will fight.

1107
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:03,834
Now, this is a game.

1108
01:24:05,173 --> 01:24:08,507
We may win, or we may lose.

1109
01:24:10,145 --> 01:24:12,341
But, I can guarantee one thing.

1110
01:24:14,516 --> 01:24:15,984
No matter what happens...

1111
01:24:16,851 --> 01:24:19,445
...you or the kids won't
go to prison.

1112
01:24:23,124 --> 01:24:26,389
I can't say for sure,
that it was Vijay Salgaonkar.

1113
01:24:26,461 --> 01:24:27,724
Really?

1114
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:30,964
You said, it was Vijay.

1115
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:34,331
No, when you asked, is that
Vijay...

1116
01:24:34,436 --> 01:24:36,302
...I thought, it was probably him.

1117
01:24:36,371 --> 01:24:38,669
But, I can't say for sure
it was him.

1118
01:24:38,773 --> 01:24:40,104
Who did you see?

1119
01:24:40,308 --> 01:24:42,640
Sir, I couldn't see too clearly.

1120
01:24:42,710 --> 01:24:44,872
I can't tell if it was Vijay
or someone else.

1121
01:24:44,979 --> 01:24:47,505
When he mentioned Vijay,
I had a doubt.

1122
01:24:48,016 --> 01:24:49,711
Was that the car'?

1123
01:24:50,051 --> 01:24:54,181
It was yellow, like this car.
But, I can't say for sure.

1124
01:24:54,255 --> 01:24:57,054
Salvi, there must be something...

1125
01:24:57,125 --> 01:24:59,719
mthat you can be sure ofl?
- Gaitonde!

1126
01:25:01,663 --> 01:25:02,789
YOU?

1127
01:25:03,264 --> 01:25:05,596
Sir, I didn't see the
license number.

1128
01:25:05,667 --> 01:25:07,601
But, it was yellow
like this one.

1129
01:25:08,236 --> 01:25:10,102
There are many yellow
cars, like this one.

1130
01:25:10,338 --> 01:25:13,467
Sir, a retired professor
lives next door.

1131
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:15,470
He has the same kind of
yellow car.

1132
01:25:15,543 --> 01:25:17,477
Oh, then it could be that car.

1133
01:25:17,545 --> 01:25:21,743
What'? You could say that
for sure'?

1134
01:25:22,817 --> 01:25:24,342
He thinks he's so intelligent!

1135
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:30,524
Sir, a fax from the IG office.

1136
01:25:30,592 --> 01:25:33,289
Sir, Sameer Deshmukh went on
a school trip, the last month.

1137
01:25:33,394 --> 01:25:36,227
Two students from Vidya Vikas
Vidyalaya were there, too.

1138
01:25:36,431 --> 01:25:37,990
I have their names
and addresses.

1139
01:25:38,566 --> 01:25:40,295
One of them is Anju Salgaonkar.

1140
01:25:41,102 --> 01:25:42,763
Vijay Salgaonkafs daughter.

1141
01:25:43,605 --> 01:25:44,766
Adopted.

1142
01:25:46,274 --> 01:25:47,799
Adopted?
- Yeah.

1143
01:25:49,177 --> 01:25:50,611
I didn't know that.

1144
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:54,676
Yes, sir. When Vijay was 21
years old...

1145
01:25:54,749 --> 01:25:58,185
...he found a baby near a
garbage bin on the road.

1146
01:25:59,020 --> 01:26:01,853
Someone had abandoned
that little baby.

1147
01:26:02,790 --> 01:26:04,758
Vijay is an orphan himself.

1148
01:26:04,893 --> 01:26:07,419
That's why, he took the
child home.

1149
01:26:07,795 --> 01:26:10,287
Later, he adopted her legally.

1150
01:26:12,901 --> 01:26:15,927
I always thought Anju and
Vijay were related by blood.

1151
01:26:17,605 --> 01:26:18,936
What is this, Gaitonde'?

1152
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:22,537
Shame on you for accusing such
a decent man.

1153
01:26:23,111 --> 01:26:25,478
Sir, sir!

1154
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:28,679
Just because he adopted an
orphan, it doesn't mean...

1155
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:30,377
mthat, he can't commit crimes.

1156
01:26:30,451 --> 01:26:31,885
We just found out...

1157
01:26:31,953 --> 01:26:34,615
...Sameer and Anju
are connected in some way.

1158
01:26:35,523 --> 01:26:37,924
I think, we should arrest Vijay...

1159
01:26:37,992 --> 01:26:40,586
...slap him around a bit
and he'll spill the beans.

1160
01:26:41,629 --> 01:26:44,564
Don't let this information
leak out ot this station.

1161
01:26:45,133 --> 01:26:47,431
Ifs...
- 11:30 am.

1162
01:26:48,336 --> 01:26:52,864
A square plus B square equals
A square, plus B square, plus 2AB.

1163
01:26:53,174 --> 01:26:55,541
A plus B whole cube equals
to...

1164
01:26:55,643 --> 01:26:57,270
...a cube, plus...
- Ma'am.

1165
01:27:00,081 --> 01:27:03,210
Anju. The principal
wants to see you.

1166
01:27:03,618 --> 01:27:05,086
Yes, ma'am.

1167
01:27:15,830 --> 01:27:19,323
The police has one last piece of
evidence to prove what happened.

1168
01:27:19,834 --> 01:27:21,233
Our fear.

1169
01:27:21,302 --> 01:27:23,361
So, forget what happened.

1170
01:27:23,805 --> 01:27:25,637
Try to behave normally.

1171
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:28,805
The police do not know
what happened in this house.

1172
01:27:28,977 --> 01:27:32,572
They will question us on the
basis of circumstantial evidence.

1173
01:27:33,147 --> 01:27:36,014
We have to answer them
without any fear.

1174
01:27:38,286 --> 01:27:40,380
They will fake things, too.

1175
01:27:40,455 --> 01:27:42,549
But, you knew Sam.

1176
01:27:43,024 --> 01:27:45,118
Don't ever refuse to accept
that.

1177
01:27:45,526 --> 01:27:48,552
Just don't tell them anything
that happened in this house.

1178
01:27:49,864 --> 01:27:50,922
May I come in, ma'am'?

1179
01:27:51,599 --> 01:27:53,761
Are you Vijay
Salgaonkafs daughter?

1180
01:27:53,935 --> 01:27:55,096
Yes, sir.

1181
01:27:56,137 --> 01:27:57,605
Do you know this boy?

1182
01:27:57,672 --> 01:27:59,538
Oh, that's Sam.

1183
01:28:00,842 --> 01:28:03,334
So, how do you know Sam?

1184
01:28:03,645 --> 01:28:07,047
I represented my school at a
nature camp, last month.

1185
01:28:07,248 --> 01:28:09,012
That's when I got to know him.

1186
01:28:09,083 --> 01:28:11,484
Was it just an acquaintance,
or...

1187
01:28:11,886 --> 01:28:13,911
No, sir. Just an acquaintance.

1188
01:28:14,022 --> 01:28:16,923
Just like all the other students
at the camp.

1189
01:28:17,025 --> 01:28:19,221
There were 'thousands oi students
at the camp,

1190
01:28:19,327 --> 01:28:21,819
how come you remember
Sam's face'?

1191
01:28:21,929 --> 01:28:25,729
Sir, Sam was quite famous
at the camp.

1192
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:27,325
Why?

1193
01:28:27,435 --> 01:28:29,460
He took pictures
of girls at the camp.

1194
01:28:29,771 --> 01:28:31,034
He shot videos, too.

1195
01:28:31,239 --> 01:28:34,539
Then, a lawyer's daughter
complained about him.

1196
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:36,633
Oh, I see.

1197
01:28:37,378 --> 01:28:40,211
Did Sam ever come to meet you
after the camp?

1198
01:28:40,748 --> 01:28:42,716
No, sir.
- Why are you lying?

1199
01:28:42,817 --> 01:28:45,252
We were told, he came to
meet you.

1200
01:28:45,653 --> 01:28:48,213
Who told you that'?
Did Sam tell you?

1201
01:28:49,557 --> 01:28:51,719
Yes, he did.

1202
01:28:52,226 --> 01:28:53,557
Sam told us.

1203
01:28:53,628 --> 01:28:55,392
Sir, Sam is lying.

1204
01:28:55,463 --> 01:28:57,261
Did Sam come to meet you...

1205
01:28:57,332 --> 01:29:00,165
...on the 2nd of October
at your place?

1206
01:29:00,268 --> 01:29:01,633
To my place?
- Yes.

1207
01:29:01,736 --> 01:29:02,862
Not at all.

1208
01:29:02,937 --> 01:29:05,702
Besides, we weren't home
on the 2nd of October.

1209
01:29:05,773 --> 01:29:07,036
Where did you go?

1210
01:29:07,108 --> 01:29:09,805
Swami Chinmayanand was holding a
sermon at Panaji.

1211
01:29:09,877 --> 01:29:11,072
We all attended it.

1212
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:12,374
Who all attended it'?

1213
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:15,506
Mom, dad, my younger
sister Anu and me.

1214
01:29:15,616 --> 01:29:18,085
When did you get back?
- The next day, the 3rd.

1215
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:20,086
Did the sermon last for <i>2</i> days'?

1216
01:29:20,521 --> 01:29:23,252
Yes, but, we attended it only
on the 2nd.

1217
01:29:23,524 --> 01:29:25,856
After that, we stayed in a hotel...

1218
01:29:25,927 --> 01:29:28,089
...and saw a movie the next
day, before returning home.

1219
01:29:28,162 --> 01:29:29,220
I see.

1220
01:29:29,664 --> 01:29:32,656
Ma'am. Show us the attendance
register, please.

1221
01:29:33,134 --> 01:29:36,502
Let's see, whether she came
to school on the second.

1222
01:29:37,271 --> 01:29:39,535
There was a holiday
at school on the 2nd.

1223
01:29:39,607 --> 01:29:40,870
Gandhi Jayanti.

1224
01:29:40,975 --> 01:29:43,342
Right, and the 3rd was a
Sunday.

1225
01:29:43,411 --> 01:29:45,004
That's why we planned it.

1226
01:29:45,079 --> 01:29:46,672
So, you mean...

1227
01:29:46,748 --> 01:29:50,207
...you've never met Sam
after the camp.

1228
01:29:50,418 --> 01:29:51,886
No, sir.

1229
01:29:54,021 --> 01:29:55,853
Okay. Thank you.

1230
01:29:56,190 --> 01:29:58,352
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, ma'am.

1231
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:16,343
Are you Vijay Salgaonkafs
wife'?

1232
01:30:17,712 --> 01:30:19,009
Yes.

1233
01:30:30,892 --> 01:30:33,884
Vijay! How come you are home
at this time'?

1234
01:30:35,163 --> 01:30:38,326
Anju's principal called Nandini and
informed her about your visit there.

1235
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,393
She got scared and called me.

1236
01:30:40,635 --> 01:30:42,763
I went to the station and
found out you're here.

1237
01:30:43,137 --> 01:30:44,696
I rushed home.

1238
01:30:45,006 --> 01:30:46,269
What has happened?

1239
01:30:46,507 --> 01:30:48,066
We need to question you.

1240
01:30:48,376 --> 01:30:49,935
Come in, lefs sit down.

1241
01:30:50,645 --> 01:30:52,739
Vijay, do you know this boy?

1242
01:30:53,581 --> 01:30:54,548
No, sir.

1243
01:30:54,916 --> 01:30:58,045
What about you?
- No, sir.

1244
01:30:59,954 --> 01:31:01,581
Have you seen this car'?

1245
01:31:02,423 --> 01:31:03,515
No sir.

1246
01:31:04,025 --> 01:31:05,254
What about you?

1247
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:07,455
No, sir.

1248
01:31:10,865 --> 01:31:12,560
Let me be frank, here.

1249
01:31:13,301 --> 01:31:14,769
That's what I'd prefer, too.

1250
01:31:16,103 --> 01:31:19,004
This is IG Meera Deshmukh's
only son, Sam Deshmukh.

1251
01:31:19,607 --> 01:31:21,541
He is missing, since the last
25 days.

1252
01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:24,978
Last month, during the
nature camp, he met...

1253
01:31:25,046 --> 01:31:26,844
...your daughter, Anju.

1254
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:31,343
We also have proof, he came here
in a yellow Hyundai Getz.

1255
01:31:32,186 --> 01:31:35,713
This car was recovered in the last
month from Paavelim Stone Quarry.

1256
01:31:37,258 --> 01:31:39,022
We came here for two reasons.

1257
01:31:39,293 --> 01:31:40,852
First, Anju knew Sam.

1258
01:31:41,429 --> 01:31:45,730
Secondly, Gaitonde saw you
driving Sam's car.

1259
01:31:46,667 --> 01:31:49,967
When you took the car past
Subhash Salvi's house...

1260
01:31:50,505 --> 01:31:51,802
...I was there.

1261
01:31:53,808 --> 01:31:55,867
We think, Sam came
to your place.

1262
01:31:55,943 --> 01:31:58,207
But, we weren't here on
the 2nd.

1263
01:31:58,312 --> 01:32:01,077
We went to Panaji for a sermon
and got back on the third.

1264
01:32:02,483 --> 01:32:03,644
Yes.

1265
01:32:04,252 --> 01:32:06,516
Vijay Salgaonkar, your
game is up.

1266
01:32:08,456 --> 01:32:09,924
Sir, what more proof do you need?

1267
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:13,588
Don't you laugh at me!

1268
01:32:14,195 --> 01:32:16,095
I didn't even mention...

1269
01:32:16,163 --> 01:32:17,892
...which date Sam came to
your place.

1270
01:32:17,965 --> 01:32:19,455
But, your wife...

1271
01:32:19,967 --> 01:32:21,628
"blurted, without being asked.

1272
01:32:22,503 --> 01:32:24,995
Vijay, are you laughing at us'?
- No, sir.

1273
01:32:26,307 --> 01:32:27,797
Why should I laugh at the
police?

1274
01:32:28,643 --> 01:32:31,340
Look at her, she is
still shocked.

1275
01:32:31,879 --> 01:32:33,870
She doesn't know what
is going on.

1276
01:32:34,815 --> 01:32:37,079
You've really petrified her.

1277
01:32:38,019 --> 01:32:41,546
I told you, earlier, the principal
called Nandini.

1278
01:32:41,889 --> 01:32:44,859
She said, that you went to the
school, about a case.

1279
01:32:45,293 --> 01:32:47,352
You questioned Anju, too.

1280
01:32:47,428 --> 01:32:51,058
You know, the school authorities
panic in such situations.

1281
01:32:51,566 --> 01:32:55,332
They think, the case will
ruin the school's image.

1282
01:32:56,003 --> 01:32:58,597
So, the principal called Nandini
and told her all about it.

1283
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:02,169
Even the dates.
Simple.

1284
01:33:02,877 --> 01:33:07,974
Gaitonde says he saw you driving
Sam's car on Sunday, the 3rd.

1285
01:33:08,916 --> 01:33:10,680
You didn't answer him.

1286
01:33:12,954 --> 01:33:15,252
There's no use.
- Why?

1287
01:33:15,957 --> 01:33:19,723
Because everyone knows
we can't stand each other.

1288
01:33:20,761 --> 01:33:23,389
No matter what I say
he will brand me a liar.

1289
01:33:24,131 --> 01:33:25,428
Forget about Gaitonde.

1290
01:33:25,833 --> 01:33:27,130
Tell me the truth.

1291
01:33:27,935 --> 01:33:29,562
H' Gaitonde saw me...

1292
01:33:30,204 --> 01:33:33,606
meither he's lying or he
is mistaken.

1293
01:33:34,241 --> 01:33:36,869
Because, on 2nd October
from 8:00 am...

1294
01:33:37,311 --> 01:33:39,643
...to 3 October, till 5:00 pm.

1295
01:33:40,014 --> 01:33:41,709
My family and I were in Panaji.

1296
01:33:41,949 --> 01:33:43,542
Sir, he's lying.

1297
01:33:44,118 --> 01:33:45,916
I saw him, that day.

1298
01:33:47,288 --> 01:33:49,882
What did you do from 2nd
to the 3rd'?

1299
01:33:50,324 --> 01:33:52,725
Where did you go?

1300
01:33:53,995 --> 01:33:56,487
Can you give me the details?
- Of course.

1301
01:33:57,131 --> 01:33:59,122
On 2nd October, we took the
5:30 am bus...

1302
01:33:59,233 --> 01:34:00,394
...and headed to Panaji.

1303
01:34:23,624 --> 01:34:26,924
When you got back, was it raining?
- Yes, it was.

1304
01:34:27,662 --> 01:34:29,391
Nandini and the kids got
drenched.

1305
01:34:29,764 --> 01:34:31,596
So, they fell sick.

1306
01:34:31,932 --> 01:34:33,559
They missed school for
a couple of days.

1307
01:34:33,834 --> 01:34:35,131
Okay.

1308
01:34:35,436 --> 01:34:38,701
So, you kept the bills and tickets
just to show us, right'?

1309
01:34:40,041 --> 01:34:43,102
Sir, who ever keeps bus tickets?

1310
01:34:44,478 --> 01:34:47,504
Sir, we are middle class people.

1311
01:34:48,516 --> 01:34:50,416
We try to save, as
much as we can.

1312
01:34:51,752 --> 01:34:54,278
<i>We check 'the bills on 'the
last</i> day <i>oi 'the month.</i>

1313
01:34:55,122 --> 01:34:58,114
To find out the unnecessary
expenses and the savings.

1314
01:35:10,004 --> 01:35:14,498
I messed up, by talking
about the dates, right'?

1315
01:35:15,976 --> 01:35:17,102
Yes.

1316
01:35:18,412 --> 01:35:22,849
But, you explained everything
and sent them away.

1317
01:35:24,518 --> 01:35:26,350
They won't come back, right'?

1318
01:35:28,689 --> 01:35:30,885
Gaitonde, your allegations are
nonsense.

1319
01:35:31,592 --> 01:35:34,425
I think, Vijay and his family
actually went to Panaji.

1320
01:35:34,762 --> 01:35:37,459
Sir, I swear to you!
It was Vijay.

1321
01:35:37,832 --> 01:35:39,800
Sir, lefs remand him to custody.

1322
01:35:39,867 --> 01:35:42,768
He won't be so sharp
once he's beaten up a bit.

1323
01:35:44,705 --> 01:35:47,003
Anyway, inform the IG.

1324
01:35:47,108 --> 01:35:48,837
Sir, let's get hold oi Vijay, first.

1325
01:35:49,143 --> 01:35:51,510
What if we inform the
IG, later'?

1326
01:35:58,519 --> 01:36:00,681
Dad.
- Yes.

1327
01:36:01,856 --> 01:36:04,951
Did the police believe us'?

1328
01:36:07,661 --> 01:36:09,288
I don't know, dear.

1329
01:36:10,498 --> 01:36:12,626
Will they come back?

1330
01:36:14,568 --> 01:36:16,696
Yes, they will be back.

1331
01:36:26,714 --> 01:36:29,308
What is his name?
- Vijay Salgaonkar.

1332
01:36:29,817 --> 01:36:32,514
Are you sure, he was driving
Sam's car'?

1333
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:34,615
Ma'am, I don't remember
the license number.

1334
01:36:35,055 --> 01:36:37,217
But, that was a yellow
Hyundai Getz car.

1335
01:36:37,591 --> 01:36:40,891
But, are you sure, Vijay
Salgaonkar was driving it'?

1336
01:36:40,961 --> 01:36:42,895
Yes, sir. Absolutely sure.

1337
01:36:42,963 --> 01:36:45,591
But, they said, they were at
Panaji on the 2nd and 3rd.

1338
01:36:46,233 --> 01:36:48,634
Sir, they're lying.
- They're lying?

1339
01:36:49,703 --> 01:36:52,172
But, what about all the proof of
his trip'?

1340
01:36:52,439 --> 01:36:54,669
He showed us hotel
bills and bus tickets.

1341
01:36:54,942 --> 01:36:56,671
But, we will know if
they are real or fake...

1342
01:36:56,777 --> 01:36:59,178
...only after we check them, sir.

1343
01:37:01,248 --> 01:37:06,846
H' Gaitonde is right, those
bills must be forged.

1344
01:37:07,421 --> 01:37:10,550
That won't be too difficult
to find out.

1345
01:37:11,859 --> 01:37:15,818
After all, he is an illiterate,
fourth grade dropout.

1346
01:37:15,930 --> 01:37:17,591
He can't be too smart.

1347
01:37:18,265 --> 01:37:21,633
Tomorrow, bring Vijay,
his family...

1348
01:37:21,735 --> 01:37:25,262
...and all the evidence shown by
him to me.

1349
01:37:25,472 --> 01:37:27,338
But, on what charge
can we bring them in'?

1350
01:37:27,942 --> 01:37:30,775
Kidnapping. Not murder.

1351
01:37:31,045 --> 01:37:32,979
Because, we need a corpse
to prove that.

1352
01:37:34,215 --> 01:37:36,707
You don't worry about protocol.
<i>I'll</i> take care of it.

1353
01:37:41,922 --> 01:37:44,550
Uncle! Uncle!

1354
01:37:45,025 --> 01:37:47,289
Mr. Plane! You're here, early!

1355
01:37:47,595 --> 01:37:49,893
The police took Vijay and his
family in.

1356
01:37:59,874 --> 01:38:02,036
When did you leave for Panaji'?

1357
01:38:02,276 --> 01:38:05,075
Sir, we took a private bus
to Panaji at 5:30 am.

1358
01:38:05,179 --> 01:38:07,170
So where's that bus ticket?

1359
01:38:07,681 --> 01:38:11,811
His friend owns the bus, so
the conductor didn't let us pay.

1360
01:38:11,886 --> 01:38:14,082
When did you reach the
venue of the sermon?

1361
01:38:15,289 --> 01:38:19,021
At 8:30 am. The sermon had
already begun.

1362
01:38:19,293 --> 01:38:23,230
I guess, about 8:30 am.

1363
01:38:23,297 --> 01:38:26,289
When we arrived, the
sermon had begun.

1364
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:28,767
When did you reach the
venue of the sermon?

1365
01:38:33,007 --> 01:38:36,671
It our statements are exactly
alike, they may have doubts.

1366
01:38:37,011 --> 01:38:38,570
Especially when it comes to
timings.

1367
01:38:39,046 --> 01:38:40,980
Mom and I will give
the exact time.

1368
01:38:41,415 --> 01:38:43,144
You can skirt around it.

1369
01:38:43,217 --> 01:38:45,015
I don't remember the exact
time.

1370
01:38:45,085 --> 01:38:48,453
But, when we arrived
the sermon had begun.

1371
01:38:48,856 --> 01:38:52,724
What time did the sermon begin
after you got there'?

1372
01:38:55,262 --> 01:38:58,129
The police is going to try to
ask complicated questions.

1373
01:38:58,465 --> 01:39:01,662
Listen to them carefully,
and then answer.

1374
01:39:02,636 --> 01:39:06,004
The sermon began before
we reached there.

1375
01:39:06,507 --> 01:39:09,306
But, your mom and dad
said that...

1376
01:39:09,376 --> 01:39:12,812
...the sermon began
after you reached the venue.

1377
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:14,348
After half an hour.

1378
01:39:14,915 --> 01:39:18,044
They will lie about us
telling them something different.

1379
01:39:18,519 --> 01:39:21,420
But, stick to your story,
at all times.

1380
01:39:22,122 --> 01:39:25,456
No! When we arrived the
event had already begun.

1381
01:39:28,929 --> 01:39:29,919
Martin.
- This way.

1382
01:39:29,997 --> 01:39:31,726
What's the matter?
Where are they'?

1383
01:39:31,799 --> 01:39:33,392
They were taken in.
- They were?

1384
01:39:33,467 --> 01:39:34,901
These people aren't telling me
anything!

1385
01:39:34,969 --> 01:39:36,528
We want to go in.
- You're not allowed in.

1386
01:39:36,637 --> 01:39:37,763
He's Vijay's father-in-law.

1387
01:39:37,838 --> 01:39:39,203
I don't care who he is.
He's not allowed in and that's that.

1388
01:39:39,306 --> 01:39:40,535
How can you stop me'?

1389
01:39:40,641 --> 01:39:42,769
You have taken my daughter
into police custody, too!

1390
01:39:42,843 --> 01:39:44,174
Come on, open the gate...
- No!

1391
01:39:44,278 --> 01:39:45,575
No, get back.
- Open the gate.

1392
01:39:45,679 --> 01:39:48,046
Get back!
- Open the gate!

1393
01:39:48,382 --> 01:39:50,851
Later, we went to a restaurant
to eat food.

1394
01:39:51,018 --> 01:39:52,679
What was the name of the hotel'?

1395
01:39:55,689 --> 01:39:57,851
I don't remember that.

1396
01:39:58,392 --> 01:39:59,723
What did you eat'?

1397
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:01,155
Pav Bhaji.

1398
01:40:01,662 --> 01:40:02,959
What did the others eat'?

1399
01:40:03,063 --> 01:40:04,462
Everyone ate Pav Bhaji.

1400
01:40:04,732 --> 01:40:06,757
But, Anju said that...

1401
01:40:06,834 --> 01:40:09,098
...she ate fried rice.

1402
01:40:15,776 --> 01:40:18,370
No! She must have forgotten.

1403
01:40:18,479 --> 01:40:20,971
I remember, we all ate
Pav Bhaji.

1404
01:40:23,917 --> 01:40:25,180
Hello?

1405
01:40:25,686 --> 01:40:27,176
Yes, ifs me.
Tell me.

1406
01:40:27,921 --> 01:40:29,514
No, that's a lie.

1407
01:40:30,557 --> 01:40:31,888
Who told you that'?

1408
01:40:32,526 --> 01:40:35,757
See, I'm in a meeting, okay?
<i>I'll</i> have to call you back.

1409
01:40:36,163 --> 01:40:37,494
<i>I'll</i> call you back.

1410
01:40:39,733 --> 01:40:41,098
A reporter from India TV called.

1411
01:40:42,236 --> 01:40:44,295
They say, they have
information that...

1412
01:40:44,638 --> 01:40:46,868
...we arrested a family
in connection with Sam's case.

1413
01:40:46,974 --> 01:40:48,703
Forget about it.
I don't care, Mahesh.

1414
01:40:49,343 --> 01:40:50,640
What do you think'?

1415
01:40:50,711 --> 01:40:54,306
Ma'am, this family is even tougher
than we thought.

1416
01:40:54,882 --> 01:40:56,748
No one changed their
statements.

1417
01:40:56,850 --> 01:40:58,648
Specially, the younger
daughter, Anu.

1418
01:40:59,186 --> 01:41:02,520
I am surprised she stuck to her
story though she is so young!

1419
01:41:03,924 --> 01:41:06,126
That's spot on.
Absolutely correct.

1420
01:41:06,126 --> 01:41:09,323
How can a child stick to her
statement so firmly?

1421
01:41:09,496 --> 01:41:10,964
I am sure something is wrong,
ma'am.

1422
01:41:14,568 --> 01:41:16,662
Ifs possible, they
are all telling the truth.

1423
01:41:17,171 --> 01:41:19,799
So, they are sticking to their
statements. That's a possibility.

1424
01:41:19,873 --> 01:41:21,967
Perhaps, Gaitonde is mistaken.

1425
01:41:22,643 --> 01:41:23,769
No, Mahesh.

1426
01:41:23,844 --> 01:41:27,075
One thing is certain.
They know something about Sam.

1427
01:41:27,247 --> 01:41:29,045
But, Meera, their statements
so tar...

1428
01:41:29,149 --> 01:41:31,846
Mahesh, 'they're lying.
It's a cooked up story.

1429
01:41:31,919 --> 01:41:34,217
Ma'am, if they are lying...

1430
01:41:34,288 --> 01:41:35,687
...then, we can conduct
a lie detector test.

1431
01:41:35,756 --> 01:41:37,622
Are you stupid, Gaitonde'?

1432
01:41:37,891 --> 01:41:39,586
We can't conduct a lie detector
test, just like that!

1433
01:41:39,693 --> 01:41:41,457
We need a court order for that.

1434
01:41:41,662 --> 01:41:43,596
So, why can't we get
court orders?

1435
01:41:44,898 --> 01:41:47,993
To do that we have to prove
they are lying, in the court.

1436
01:41:48,102 --> 01:41:49,968
So far, all the evidence
we have found...

1437
01:41:50,037 --> 01:41:53,769
...proves the family wasn't there
on that weekend.

1438
01:41:54,942 --> 01:41:57,309
Sorry, I am sure you know
what you're doing.

1439
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:01,741
Prabhu.
- Yes, ma'am.

1440
01:42:01,849 --> 01:42:03,874
They told us a story, right'?

1441
01:42:04,384 --> 01:42:06,512
So, bring all the characters
from that story here.

1442
01:42:06,887 --> 01:42:08,355
Got it'?
- Yes, ma'am.

1443
01:42:08,622 --> 01:42:09,783
Besides that...

1444
01:42:10,791 --> 01:42:14,523
...if Vijay is lying about the
trip to Panaji...

1445
01:42:14,928 --> 01:42:17,454
...then, there is someone
who saw him here.

1446
01:42:17,664 --> 01:42:18,825
Of course.

1447
01:42:18,932 --> 01:42:21,264
A boy called Jose works
in his office.

1448
01:42:21,335 --> 01:42:23,269
Is there any other place
which he visits, regularly?

1449
01:42:23,337 --> 01:42:24,327
Yes, ma'am.

1450
01:42:24,438 --> 01:42:26,270
There's a hotel named
Martin's Corner.

1451
01:42:26,340 --> 01:42:27,933
Ifs right in front of the police
station.

1452
01:42:28,008 --> 01:42:30,102
Vijay comes there, every day.
- Okay.

1453
01:42:30,777 --> 01:42:34,805
So, bring the office boy and
hotel manager here, tomorrow.

1454
01:42:35,015 --> 01:42:36,312
Okay, ma'am.

1455
01:42:37,684 --> 01:42:39,083
One more thing"

1456
01:42:40,287 --> 01:42:44,724
When the family leaves, they should
feel we believed their story.

1457
01:42:48,729 --> 01:42:53,929
I was really nervous during
the interrogation.

1458
01:42:54,902 --> 01:42:56,870
Luckily, they believed us.

1459
01:42:58,372 --> 01:43:00,272
Who said, they believed us'?

1460
01:43:01,308 --> 01:43:02,503
What do you mean?

1461
01:43:03,443 --> 01:43:05,969
They won't let us go, so easily.

1462
01:43:06,713 --> 01:43:08,044
They will be back.

1463
01:43:08,749 --> 01:43:10,513
They will be even better
prepared.

1464
01:43:16,757 --> 01:43:17,952
They will be back.

1465
01:43:18,725 --> 01:43:21,422
Why?
Vijay, what's 'the problem?

1466
01:43:22,596 --> 01:43:24,587
I am your brother-in-law.
At least, tell me.

1467
01:43:24,665 --> 01:43:27,396
Rajesh, every family
has some secrets...

1468
01:43:28,101 --> 01:43:29,967
mthat are best kept hidden.

1469
01:43:30,537 --> 01:43:33,199
I am sorry.
I can't tell you anything.

1470
01:43:33,507 --> 01:43:36,841
But, I will need your help.

1471
01:43:37,911 --> 01:43:39,003
What do you want me to do?

1472
01:43:42,883 --> 01:43:45,352
I have known Vijay
since he was a kid.

1473
01:43:45,786 --> 01:43:47,345
He's really good and decent.

1474
01:43:48,355 --> 01:43:50,016
With a heart of gold.

1475
01:43:50,090 --> 01:43:52,752
I don't recall asking whether
he has a heart of gold or silver.

1476
01:43:54,628 --> 01:43:58,895
How many times did he visit your
hotel on the 2nd of October?

1477
01:43:58,966 --> 01:44:00,798
Normally, he comes twice a day.

1478
01:44:00,901 --> 01:44:02,528
For evening tea, dinner.

1479
01:44:02,636 --> 01:44:04,263
And sometimes, he comes
over for lunch, too.

1480
01:44:04,338 --> 01:44:07,103
I guess, he came over twice
on the 2nd, too.

1481
01:44:11,345 --> 01:44:12,870
No, wait!

1482
01:44:13,413 --> 01:44:15,814
He wasn't here on the 2nd.

1483
01:44:16,216 --> 01:44:17,843
He went to Panaji for a sermon.

1484
01:44:17,918 --> 01:44:19,579
Then, why didn't you tell us
that before?

1485
01:44:19,886 --> 01:44:22,412
Sorry, sir.
I remembered it out of the blue.

1486
01:44:23,023 --> 01:44:26,049
A 'few days ago,
Vijay and I spoke about that.

1487
01:44:26,593 --> 01:44:28,721
What did he tell you about
the sermon?

1488
01:44:29,062 --> 01:44:31,326
He told me it was a very
good event.

1489
01:44:31,665 --> 01:44:35,602
He even told us what
Swami Chinmayanand said.

1490
01:44:35,836 --> 01:44:37,531
So, what did he say'?

1491
01:44:37,638 --> 01:44:39,936
He narrated one of
the Jataka fables.

1492
01:44:40,340 --> 01:44:43,605
It was 'the story oi 'the
king oi Benaras...

1493
01:44:43,677 --> 01:44:45,338
"defeating his enemy
with love and patience.

1494
01:44:45,412 --> 01:44:47,312
When did Vijay get back
from Panaji'?

1495
01:44:48,048 --> 01:44:50,073
The next day.
- At what time'?

1496
01:44:50,684 --> 01:44:52,482
I don't know that.

1497
01:44:52,552 --> 01:44:54,714
Because, he didn't come
to the office that day.

1498
01:44:54,788 --> 01:44:56,688
Did Vijay call you from Panaji'?

1499
01:44:57,924 --> 01:44:59,119
No.

1500
01:44:59,259 --> 01:45:01,785
Is Vijay Salgaonkar your friend?

1501
01:45:01,895 --> 01:45:03,226
Yes, he is.

1502
01:45:03,297 --> 01:45:05,823
Did he travel on your bus
recently?

1503
01:45:06,767 --> 01:45:08,098
Yes.

1504
01:45:08,168 --> 01:45:10,296
A few days ago.

1505
01:45:10,537 --> 01:45:13,268
And before that'?
- Before that'?

1506
01:45:13,807 --> 01:45:15,673
Right. On the 2nd.

1507
01:45:16,777 --> 01:45:19,405
Where was he going?
- To Panaji.

1508
01:45:20,247 --> 01:45:22,238
He was going to attend
some sermon.

1509
01:45:25,485 --> 01:45:29,046
Are you sure, those people
were at your lodge? - Yes, sir.

1510
01:45:29,122 --> 01:45:31,352
Are they your regular customers?

1511
01:45:31,892 --> 01:45:34,122
No, Sir.
- Then, how can you be sure...

1512
01:45:34,227 --> 01:45:36,423
mthat they were at
your lodge?

1513
01:45:38,665 --> 01:45:40,155
I need a double room.

1514
01:45:41,001 --> 01:45:42,696
Rs. 800 plus taxes.

1515
01:45:43,136 --> 01:45:45,798
What are you saying?
I have stayed here, before.

1516
01:45:46,173 --> 01:45:47,698
You didn't charge taxes
back then.

1517
01:45:48,175 --> 01:45:49,609
Then you won't get any bills.

1518
01:45:49,676 --> 01:45:51,166
That will do.

1519
01:45:54,915 --> 01:45:58,010
Listen, this lodge doesn't
seem to be good enough.

1520
01:45:58,085 --> 01:45:59,951
Let's go to a family hotel.

1521
01:46:00,053 --> 01:46:02,351
Come on, ma'am.
This is a family hotel.

1522
01:46:02,422 --> 01:46:04,754
Don't worry.
He's been here, before.

1523
01:46:05,292 --> 01:46:08,125
They checked the room first
and only then did they book it.

1524
01:46:08,228 --> 01:46:09,627
When did that happen?

1525
01:46:10,731 --> 01:46:12,130
I don't remember, sir.

1526
01:46:12,232 --> 01:46:15,133
Did they tell you why
they were in Panaji'?

1527
01:46:16,370 --> 01:46:17,838
No, I don't remember, sir.

1528
01:46:18,338 --> 01:46:20,306
Did you check their register?
- Yes, ma'am.

1529
01:46:20,774 --> 01:46:22,105
He has <i>2</i> registers.

1530
01:46:22,175 --> 01:46:24,576
One of them has
Vijay Salgaonkafs name.

1531
01:46:24,978 --> 01:46:27,208
There's a check in on 2nd
October. And...

1532
01:46:27,314 --> 01:46:29,408
...check out at 9:30 am
on the 3rd.

1533
01:46:29,516 --> 01:46:31,484
Why do you have two registers?

1534
01:46:32,853 --> 01:46:35,254
Why don't you answer ma'am'?

1535
01:46:36,056 --> 01:46:38,855
One register is for the billing
customers.

1536
01:46:38,925 --> 01:46:41,155
The other is for customers
who don't take bills.

1537
01:46:41,595 --> 01:46:44,064
Do you know, that's a crime?

1538
01:46:44,765 --> 01:46:46,824
How can you still remember
them'?

1539
01:46:47,134 --> 01:46:49,193
Good customers are hard
to forget.

1540
01:46:53,507 --> 01:46:55,134
You own the hotel.

1541
01:46:55,842 --> 01:46:56,866
Why? What's the matter?

1542
01:46:56,977 --> 01:46:59,742
No. I have never eaten
such tasty Pav Bhaji.

1543
01:47:00,247 --> 01:47:03,683
Honestly, my wife makes
that at home, but...

1544
01:47:04,684 --> 01:47:07,210
We are famous for Pav Bhaji
in the city of Panaji.

1545
01:47:07,287 --> 01:47:09,585
The hotel is really clean
and hygienic.

1546
01:47:09,856 --> 01:47:11,290
The service is excellent.

1547
01:47:11,591 --> 01:47:13,559
Once a hotel is famous,
these days...

1548
01:47:13,927 --> 01:47:16,259
...the service tends to get tacky.

1549
01:47:16,496 --> 01:47:18,726
But, you're not like that.
I really like that.

1550
01:47:19,766 --> 01:47:21,097
Thank you, sir.

1551
01:47:22,936 --> 01:47:25,633
Uncle, the Pav Bhaji was
really good.

1552
01:47:25,705 --> 01:47:28,504
Really?
Thank you.

1553
01:47:28,608 --> 01:47:30,975
What's your name, dear?
- Anu!

1554
01:47:31,077 --> 01:47:32,545
Very good.

1555
01:47:33,246 --> 01:47:35,044
Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

1556
01:47:35,549 --> 01:47:38,246
I admit, you would remember
customers who appreciate you.

1557
01:47:38,351 --> 01:47:40,877
But, how do you remember
which day...

1558
01:47:40,954 --> 01:47:42,718
...and why, they came to
Panaji.

1559
01:47:42,956 --> 01:47:44,685
They told me.

1560
01:47:45,358 --> 01:47:47,122
As a businessman...

1561
01:47:47,227 --> 01:47:48,888
Okay, okay, fine!

1562
01:47:49,396 --> 01:47:50,795
You can wait outside.

1563
01:47:54,301 --> 01:47:59,296
H' Vijay Salgaonkar met all these
people on 2nd and 3rd October...

1564
01:47:59,706 --> 01:48:02,334
...how can he be in Pondolem
at the same time'?

1565
01:48:03,043 --> 01:48:04,408
Ma'am, I don't know.

1566
01:48:04,511 --> 01:48:06,411
Now I am a bit confused, too.

1567
01:48:06,746 --> 01:48:08,339
Can I say something'?

1568
01:48:09,483 --> 01:48:11,815
H' you ask me, I believe...

1569
01:48:11,885 --> 01:48:13,717
...Vijay and his family
are telling the truth.

1570
01:48:14,588 --> 01:48:16,056
Perhaps, your man is lying.

1571
01:48:16,356 --> 01:48:18,757
No, sir.
I'm telling the truth.

1572
01:48:18,859 --> 01:48:20,554
It was Vijay Salgaonkar.

1573
01:48:20,794 --> 01:48:24,389
I will resign,
if I am proved wrong.

1574
01:48:28,068 --> 01:48:29,593
Did you speak to Swami
Chinmayanand'?

1575
01:48:29,669 --> 01:48:32,036
Yes, ma'am.
He was out of town.

1576
01:48:32,138 --> 01:48:34,038
He may be back by now.
- Call him.

1577
01:48:34,441 --> 01:48:36,500
Given what you've told me...

1578
01:48:36,610 --> 01:48:40,046
...it seems, Vijay and his
family...

1579
01:48:40,146 --> 01:48:42,410
...were present at our
sermon, that day.

1580
01:48:42,916 --> 01:48:45,351
Because, every sermon of mine is
unique.

1581
01:48:45,719 --> 01:48:47,380
I never repeat it.

1582
01:48:47,954 --> 01:48:51,720
Perhaps, someone who attended
it told Vijay later.

1583
01:48:52,058 --> 01:48:56,894
But, it's not possible that someone
remembered all those details.

1584
01:48:58,265 --> 01:48:59,426
Thank you, Swamiji.

1585
01:49:08,475 --> 01:49:09,943
Where are dad and Anu'?

1586
01:49:10,677 --> 01:49:12,042
This is a digital projector.

1587
01:49:12,345 --> 01:49:14,473
I dream of having my own
theater in Pondolem.

1588
01:49:14,548 --> 01:49:15,674
Very good!

1589
01:49:15,749 --> 01:49:18,480
All the theaters have digital
projection, these days.

1590
01:49:18,552 --> 01:49:21,180
The costs are low
and the quality is pristine.

1591
01:49:21,421 --> 01:49:22,547
Dad.

1592
01:49:23,189 --> 01:49:25,556
My elder daughter and my wife.
- Hello.

1593
01:49:26,726 --> 01:49:28,160
Do you remember
when they came to you?

1594
01:49:28,261 --> 01:49:29,490
On the 3rd of this month.

1595
01:49:29,596 --> 01:49:31,064
How do you remember the date'?

1596
01:49:31,131 --> 01:49:32,963
He saw the first half of the
film...

1597
01:49:33,066 --> 01:49:34,761
...from the projection room.

1598
01:49:34,834 --> 01:49:37,496
And he also told me that, he...

1599
01:49:37,604 --> 01:49:39,766
...had come to Panaji for
a sermon.

1600
01:49:39,839 --> 01:49:41,307
And, he was staying in a lodge.

1601
01:49:41,374 --> 01:49:44,207
Get out.
Just get out!

1602
01:49:45,245 --> 01:49:48,510
Let's go. Go out.
Go on.

1603
01:49:48,582 --> 01:49:51,574
Meera. Come on.

1604
01:50:03,296 --> 01:50:04,991
Stop it.

1605
01:50:07,267 --> 01:50:08,428
Look at me.

1606
01:50:09,269 --> 01:50:12,204
Nothing will happen to Sam.
Okay? Just stop worrying.

1607
01:50:12,973 --> 01:50:14,338
We will find him.

1608
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:19,813
Don't worry and don't
lose hope.

1609
01:50:21,715 --> 01:50:23,513
I haven't given up, Mahesh.

1610
01:50:25,085 --> 01:50:26,917
But, I am a mom too.

1611
01:50:27,621 --> 01:50:29,089
I can't help that.

1612
01:50:29,789 --> 01:50:31,621
Stop crying-

1613
01:50:35,595 --> 01:50:36,892
Listen, this...

1614
01:50:37,464 --> 01:50:39,592
Is this investigation
taking the right course'?

1615
01:50:39,933 --> 01:50:42,095
Yes. I think so.

1616
01:50:44,504 --> 01:50:46,666
Then, why can't we unearth
any clues'?

1617
01:50:47,273 --> 01:50:49,970
All the clues and witnesses
seem to be in his favor.

1618
01:50:52,178 --> 01:50:53,805
I know, Mahesh.

1619
01:50:54,481 --> 01:50:58,884
All the proof and witnesses
are in Vijay's favor.

1620
01:51:00,787 --> 01:51:02,846
But, I know he's lying.

1621
01:51:02,922 --> 01:51:04,890
They are all lying.

1622
01:51:05,525 --> 01:51:07,289
I can feel it.

1623
01:51:14,934 --> 01:51:18,632
The police can tell from the
way a person talks...

1624
01:51:19,506 --> 01:51:21,497
...whether he's lying or telling
the truth.

1625
01:51:25,345 --> 01:51:29,407
I underestimated him by
considering him uneducated.

1626
01:51:30,083 --> 01:51:31,482
That was a mistake.

1627
01:51:32,752 --> 01:51:37,212
He may be a 4th grade dropout, but
he is extremely cunning.

1628
01:51:37,590 --> 01:51:39,024
He is really wily.

1629
01:51:39,726 --> 01:51:42,218
Vijay Salgaonkar is a very
good man.

1630
01:51:42,829 --> 01:51:44,627
I have checked his records.

1631
01:51:45,665 --> 01:51:47,963
He came to this village
25 years ago.

1632
01:51:48,635 --> 01:51:51,866
First, a tea stall,
then a grocery shop.

1633
01:51:51,971 --> 01:51:53,632
A video library, a garage.

1634
01:51:53,707 --> 01:51:56,005
He worked in diverse places
and grew up.

1635
01:51:56,109 --> 01:51:58,544
Later, he started
up his own business.

1636
01:51:59,012 --> 01:52:00,343
He's a fourth grade dropout.

1637
01:52:00,413 --> 01:52:03,075
But, he knows Marathi, Hindi,
English and Konkani.

1638
01:52:03,183 --> 01:52:05,345
He says, he learnt
all that from watching films.

1639
01:52:06,019 --> 01:52:08,010
He does love movies.

1640
01:52:08,421 --> 01:52:10,253
He never misses out
a single film.

1641
01:52:15,562 --> 01:52:17,223
Films.

1642
01:52:18,998 --> 01:52:20,591
That's an important link.

1643
01:52:24,871 --> 01:52:26,100
Come on, lefs go!

1644
01:52:26,172 --> 01:52:27,537
Wait a bit.

1645
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:28,607
What is it'?

1646
01:52:28,675 --> 01:52:30,268
I forget to get money
tor the tickets.

1647
01:52:30,343 --> 01:52:32,209
Is there any ATM nearby?
I...

1648
01:52:32,312 --> 01:52:35,543
What is this? I will have to
hold up the bus for you.

1649
01:52:35,648 --> 01:52:37,138
There's an ATM up ahead,
go ahead and hurry back.

1650
01:52:37,217 --> 01:52:38,378
Two minutes.
- Go on.

1651
01:52:45,925 --> 01:52:48,826
Prabhu, get me all the CCTV footage
from that ATM.

1652
01:52:49,295 --> 01:52:50,785
Where is it'?
In Panaji'?

1653
01:52:50,897 --> 01:52:53,332
Taligaon bus stand,
5 kms away from Panaji.

1654
01:52:53,433 --> 01:52:55,527
When was the bus
scheduled to leave?

1655
01:52:55,635 --> 01:52:57,000
At 3:00 pm in the afternoon.

1656
01:52:57,337 --> 01:53:01,137
I want the CCTV footage
for the ATM...

1657
01:53:01,207 --> 01:53:03,437
...for 3rd October,
from 2:30 pm to 3:30 pm right now.

1658
01:53:04,277 --> 01:53:05,574
Sawant!

1659
01:53:06,179 --> 01:53:09,046
You meet thousands of
passengers, every day. - Yes.

1660
01:53:09,149 --> 01:53:12,915
Let's say, you remember
the family due to the ATM.

1661
01:53:13,319 --> 01:53:15,617
But, when did the family
go to Panaji'?

1662
01:53:15,722 --> 01:53:17,281
Why were they there'?

1663
01:53:17,390 --> 01:53:19,916
It is impossible to remember
all of that.

1664
01:53:20,026 --> 01:53:22,620
He told you something
25 days ago.

1665
01:53:22,729 --> 01:53:24,288
How do you still remember it'?

1666
01:53:24,397 --> 01:53:26,559
I don't remember.
He told me.

1667
01:53:26,633 --> 01:53:29,330
Yes, but, you were
told 25 days ago.

1668
01:53:29,435 --> 01:53:31,164
How can you still...
- No, I...

1669
01:53:31,504 --> 01:53:33,495
What do you mean?
- I mean...

1670
01:53:33,606 --> 01:53:35,199
...he told me that, when...

1671
01:53:35,308 --> 01:53:37,675
...we met again, recently.

1672
01:53:38,912 --> 01:53:40,676
Again?
- Yes.

1673
01:53:40,747 --> 01:53:42,078
When?

1674
01:53:43,249 --> 01:53:44,717
A few days ago.

1675
01:53:45,451 --> 01:53:46,714
Where?

1676
01:53:48,054 --> 01:53:49,385
Where did you meet him?

1677
01:53:52,759 --> 01:53:56,423
Uncle!
- Oh, how are you?

1678
01:53:57,397 --> 01:53:58,762
How come you're here?

1679
01:53:58,832 --> 01:54:00,630
Vijay, don't you remember him?

1680
01:54:00,733 --> 01:54:04,294
We came here for Chinmayanands
sermon on 2nd October.

1681
01:54:04,370 --> 01:54:07,431
When we were going back
the next day...

1682
01:54:07,507 --> 01:54:09,703
...he was the conductor
on our bus.

1683
01:54:09,809 --> 01:54:12,506
You went to withdraw cash
at the ATM...

1684
01:54:12,579 --> 01:54:14,809
Oh, right! On the 2nd, after
the sermon...

1685
01:54:14,881 --> 01:54:16,975
...we went back on the bus
on the 3rd.

1686
01:54:17,050 --> 01:54:18,711
You were the conductor on that bus.
- Right.

1687
01:54:18,818 --> 01:54:20,286
You forget everything!

1688
01:54:20,386 --> 01:54:22,252
Sorry, I...
- That's okay.

1689
01:54:22,355 --> 01:54:23,720
See you later.
- Okay.

1690
01:54:32,232 --> 01:54:34,394
Mr. Vasu, has the show begun'?

1691
01:54:34,467 --> 01:54:35,730
Ifs you!

1692
01:54:35,802 --> 01:54:38,134
No, there's still time.
Where is your family?

1693
01:54:38,204 --> 01:54:39,968
No, I am alone today.
- Okay.

1694
01:54:40,039 --> 01:54:41,438
There was a sermon on the
2nd, right'?

1695
01:54:41,507 --> 01:54:43,032
That's why the family was
with me.

1696
01:54:43,209 --> 01:54:45,678
We went shopping on the 3rd and
then came for a movie.

1697
01:54:45,745 --> 01:54:48,009
Atter that, we ate at the hotel
and then went back home.

1698
01:54:48,081 --> 01:54:50,015
Imagine how expensive
that can be.

1699
01:54:55,221 --> 01:54:56,188
Dinkar.

1700
01:54:56,389 --> 01:54:59,620
We went 'to 'the sermon
at Panaji on 'the 2nd on your bus.

1701
01:54:59,959 --> 01:55:01,484
You didn't accept any money
from me.

1702
01:55:01,594 --> 01:55:03,255
But, that won't happen today.

1703
01:55:04,097 --> 01:55:05,895
Let me buy the tickets today.

1704
01:55:05,965 --> 01:55:07,990
Don't do that!

1705
01:55:08,735 --> 01:55:10,601
Why don't you tell him?

1706
01:55:10,670 --> 01:55:13,037
She won't say anything to me!
Here, give me tickets.

1707
01:55:17,710 --> 01:55:19,178
You've come after a while, sir.

1708
01:55:19,245 --> 01:55:22,476
No, we were here on 'the
2nd 'for 'the sermon at Panaji.

1709
01:55:22,548 --> 01:55:27,076
We visited exactly a day
after the sermon.

1710
01:55:27,186 --> 01:55:28,676
On 3rd October.

1711
01:55:28,755 --> 01:55:30,018
Right.

1712
01:55:30,089 --> 01:55:31,614
Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

1713
01:55:35,962 --> 01:55:39,262
3 weeks? - I told you, I'm going to
Panaji for the sermon.

1714
01:55:39,332 --> 01:55:42,131
I told you to pay this
the day after I got back.

1715
01:55:42,802 --> 01:55:45,100
Yes.
- When did I go to Panaji'?

1716
01:55:45,171 --> 01:55:47,333
Well...

1717
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:49,306
On Saturday, the 2nd of October.

1718
01:55:49,876 --> 01:55:51,537
Yes.
- When did I go?

1719
01:55:52,211 --> 01:55:53,679
On Saturday, the 2nd of October.

1720
01:55:53,746 --> 01:55:57,478
When did I get back?
On Sunday the 3rd of October.

1721
01:55:58,051 --> 01:56:01,077
Yes, you got back on Sunday,
3rd October.

1722
01:56:01,187 --> 01:56:03,884
The next day on 4th October,
a Monday...

1723
01:56:03,957 --> 01:56:05,721
...I told you to pay this.

1724
01:56:06,192 --> 01:56:07,591
Yes.
- Go and pay it.

1725
01:56:10,797 --> 01:56:13,732
The other king was reformed
by his example.

1726
01:56:15,101 --> 01:56:17,627
The moral of this story
is, we must cultivate...

1727
01:56:18,438 --> 01:56:21,169
...the power to forgive others.

1728
01:56:23,810 --> 01:56:25,642
Great! Very good!

1729
01:56:27,080 --> 01:56:29,310
But, how did you hear
that story'?

1730
01:56:29,849 --> 01:56:31,874
I told you, we went to Panaji...

1731
01:56:31,985 --> 01:56:34,079
...to attend Swami Chinmayanands
sermon.

1732
01:56:34,187 --> 01:56:35,518
When?

1733
01:56:35,788 --> 01:56:37,347
Did you forget, already?

1734
01:56:37,557 --> 01:56:39,685
We went on the 2nd,
it was a Saturday.

1735
01:56:39,892 --> 01:56:41,553
And we got back on the 3rd.

1736
01:56:43,496 --> 01:56:44,827
That's where I heard
this story.

1737
01:56:47,300 --> 01:56:48,825
Okay.

1738
01:56:49,402 --> 01:56:52,269
Ma'am. Swami Chinmayanand.

1739
01:56:54,774 --> 01:56:55,866
Yes, Swamiji.

1740
01:56:55,975 --> 01:56:59,570
My followers record my sermons.

1741
01:57:00,079 --> 01:57:03,572
They are provided to the devotees
via DVDs.

1742
01:57:04,017 --> 01:57:06,042
The devotees can make bookings.

1743
01:57:06,686 --> 01:57:10,054
They can pick them up from the
ashram, within <i>2</i> weeks.

1744
01:57:10,456 --> 01:57:13,551
I have seen the booking list
tor the sermon on the 2nd.

1745
01:57:13,626 --> 01:57:16,288
But, Vijay Salgaonkafs
name doesn't feature in it.

1746
01:57:16,996 --> 01:57:18,555
Alright, thank you so much.

1747
01:57:20,166 --> 01:57:22,965
Possibly, he booked it
under another name.

1748
01:57:23,436 --> 01:57:24,597
Ifs possible.

1749
01:57:25,438 --> 01:57:29,306
But it doesn't prove he wasn't
in Panaji on the 2nd and 3rd.

1750
01:57:29,375 --> 01:57:33,039
Ma'am, the CCTV footage for
the ICICI Bank.

1751
01:58:07,246 --> 01:58:08,407
No.

1752
01:58:13,319 --> 01:58:14,946
Ifs over, finished.

1753
01:58:16,522 --> 01:58:18,012
Vijay was telling the truth.
- But, sir...

1754
01:58:18,091 --> 01:58:19,889
We have wasted so much time!

1755
01:58:22,228 --> 01:58:25,061
It may have been better
to try to find Sam instead.

1756
01:58:25,498 --> 01:58:27,728
But, I really...
- Gaitonde.

1757
01:58:28,334 --> 01:58:30,029
But, what more proof
do you want now'?

1758
01:58:32,538 --> 01:58:34,506
Ifs over, ifs finished.

1759
01:58:37,009 --> 01:58:38,499
But...

1760
01:58:40,046 --> 01:58:43,482
Meera. Our investigation hinges
on the fact, that...

1761
01:58:43,549 --> 01:58:46,712
...whether Vijay was in Panaji on
the 2nd and 3rd, or not'?

1762
01:58:47,587 --> 01:58:49,385
The camera doesn't lie, Meera!

1763
01:58:50,957 --> 01:58:54,450
The CCTV proves, that Vijay was
in Panaji on the 3rd.

1764
01:59:02,034 --> 01:59:05,868
Vijay was in Panaji on the 3rd.

1765
01:59:10,877 --> 01:59:14,575
Vijay was in Panaji on
the 3rd, too!

1766
01:59:17,350 --> 01:59:18,579
Makes sense.

1767
01:59:21,420 --> 01:59:24,014
That means...
- Meera.

1768
01:59:25,992 --> 01:59:31,158
Mahesh, he knew we were going
to watch this CCTV footage.

1769
01:59:31,264 --> 01:59:33,596
In fact, he wanted us to see it.

1770
01:59:34,433 --> 01:59:37,266
That was part of his plan, Mahesh.
- What plan, Meera'?

1771
01:59:39,705 --> 01:59:41,833
It was an amazing plan.

1772
01:59:53,786 --> 01:59:57,222
At about 8:30 am.
- The sermon had started by then.

1773
01:59:57,290 --> 01:59:58,951
Vijay wasn't here on the 2nd.

1774
01:59:59,058 --> 02:00:02,153
He saw the entire first halt
ot the film in the projection room.

1775
02:00:02,295 --> 02:00:03,990
No one forgets about
good customers, ma'am.

1776
02:00:04,063 --> 02:00:07,192
He told me about that, recently
again, when we met.

1777
02:00:07,300 --> 02:00:10,565
We had come to Panaji for
a sermon, on the 2nd.

1778
02:00:11,571 --> 02:00:13,699
He just recreated that day.

1779
02:00:15,808 --> 02:00:17,606
In fact, both the days.

1780
02:00:18,978 --> 02:00:20,969
The 2nd and 3rd of October.

1781
02:00:21,180 --> 02:00:22,477
What do you mean?

1782
02:00:22,582 --> 02:00:24,744
What do we usually remember?

1783
02:00:26,352 --> 02:00:28,480
Something we have seen
for ourselves.

1784
02:00:29,555 --> 02:00:30,954
Visuals.

1785
02:00:32,124 --> 02:00:33,455
Visuals.

1786
02:00:34,393 --> 02:00:37,988
Something we see,
can't be easily forgotten.

1787
02:00:40,866 --> 02:00:43,699
Visual memories are
the strongest memories.

1788
02:00:45,037 --> 02:00:46,505
For example, cinema.

1789
02:00:46,672 --> 02:00:51,075
You know, the stories you are
watching are not real.

1790
02:00:52,278 --> 02:00:54,212
But, you still believe in them.

1791
02:00:55,581 --> 02:00:59,313
Because, you have seen the story
and lived it in a way.

1792
02:00:59,518 --> 02:01:00,986
In the same way...

1793
02:01:01,354 --> 02:01:05,791
...Vijay and his family not only
concocted the story about Panaji...

1794
02:01:06,626 --> 02:01:08,390
...in fact, they lived it out.

1795
02:01:10,663 --> 02:01:12,654
They actually went to Panaji.

1796
02:01:12,999 --> 02:01:14,467
They stayed at a lodge.

1797
02:01:14,667 --> 02:01:16,396
They did eat the Pav Bhaji.

1798
02:01:16,569 --> 02:01:18,936
He sat in the projection
room and watched the film.

1799
02:01:19,372 --> 02:01:23,002
So, they stuck to their statements,
during the interrogation.

1800
02:01:23,175 --> 02:01:25,234
Because, they were telling
the truth.

1801
02:01:25,411 --> 02:01:27,140
Apart from one little detail.

1802
02:01:28,281 --> 02:01:29,749
What was that'?

1803
02:01:30,216 --> 02:01:33,413
They didn't do all that
on 'the 2nd and 3rd oi October.

1804
02:01:33,919 --> 02:01:35,182
They did that, some other day.

1805
02:01:35,521 --> 02:01:36,682
Perhaps, the next day.

1806
02:01:36,789 --> 02:01:38,120
Ma'am.

1807
02:01:38,324 --> 02:01:41,453
Vijay said, it was raining
on the way back, they were drenched.

1808
02:01:41,527 --> 02:01:43,291
And his family fell sick.

1809
02:01:43,462 --> 02:01:46,796
He also said, his kids missed
school for a few days.

1810
02:01:46,866 --> 02:01:49,028
He showed us the medical bills
too.

1811
02:01:49,302 --> 02:01:52,499
You can get fake medical bills
very easily, Sawant.

1812
02:01:52,772 --> 02:01:56,731
Anyway, he's been throwing
bills at us from the word go.

1813
02:01:58,110 --> 02:02:00,772
But, there is an entry in the
lodge register for the 2nd.

1814
02:02:01,347 --> 02:02:04,044
The bus and film tickets tor the
3rd are authentic, right'?

1815
02:02:04,183 --> 02:02:05,582
That's a valid point, ma'am.

1816
02:02:07,887 --> 02:02:12,017
Very well played, fourth grade
dropout, Vijay Salgaonkar.

1817
02:02:14,360 --> 02:02:16,454
But, I know how you did that.

1818
02:02:18,164 --> 02:02:20,963
Vijay went to Panaji on 3rd October
in Sam's car.

1819
02:02:21,167 --> 02:02:23,363
He took a take away from
a restaurant.

1820
02:02:23,703 --> 02:02:26,832
Then, he probably
bought a used phone.

1821
02:02:27,273 --> 02:02:29,207
He put Sam's SIM card into it.

1822
02:02:29,375 --> 02:02:32,777
Then, he dumped the phone into
a truck with a national permit.

1823
02:02:33,412 --> 02:02:37,645
Then, he probably dumped Sam's
car into the lake at the quarry.

1824
02:02:38,150 --> 02:02:42,280
Then, he went back to a restaurant
and bought tour Pav Bhaji takeouts.

1825
02:02:42,521 --> 02:02:45,149
He purchased tour tickets
to the cinema, on that day.

1826
02:02:45,424 --> 02:02:47,222
Then, he went to Taligaon
bus stand...

1827
02:02:47,426 --> 02:02:50,794
...and withdrew the money
from the ATM at 3:00 pm.

1828
02:02:52,798 --> 02:02:55,358
Then, he took a Kadamba bus...

1829
02:02:55,735 --> 02:02:58,067
...bought 4 tickets and got back
to Pondolenn.

1830
02:02:59,105 --> 02:03:00,436
He went to his office at night.

1831
02:03:00,639 --> 02:03:04,598
He told Jose, he was going for
the sermon, the next day.

1832
02:03:05,044 --> 02:03:06,876
The next morning
he took his family...

1833
02:03:06,946 --> 02:03:09,438
...and travelled by Dinkar's private
bus to Panaji.

1834
02:03:09,615 --> 02:03:13,483
Vijay told him he was going to
Panaji for the sermon.

1835
02:03:13,686 --> 02:03:17,816
On reaching Panaji, he may have
reached the hermitage at 9:00 am.

1836
02:03:18,157 --> 02:03:21,320
Then, they spent the whole
day at the ashram.

1837
02:03:21,827 --> 02:03:25,559
Meanwhile, he found out
about the DVDs for the sermon.

1838
02:03:25,831 --> 02:03:28,892
He booked it under an
assumed name.

1839
02:03:29,769 --> 02:03:31,669
They arrived at Rishabh Lodge
in the evening.

1840
02:03:32,271 --> 02:03:35,434
Then, I guess, while 'the manager
gave Nandini 'the 'tour...

1841
02:03:35,641 --> 02:03:39,441
...\/ijay filled his name in
'the entries 'for 'the 2nd.

1842
02:03:39,845 --> 02:03:42,542
Then, when the manager returned
he disguised his handwriting...

1843
02:03:42,615 --> 02:03:44,549
...and took the room under
an assumed name.

1844
02:03:44,717 --> 02:03:46,617
They ate out at night.

1845
02:03:46,886 --> 02:03:49,787
The next day, they ordered
food from the same restaurant...

1846
02:03:49,955 --> 02:03:52,322
...where he bought 'the
'take aways on 'the 3rd.

1847
02:03:52,491 --> 02:03:55,654
After checking out of the lodge,
he took his family to the hotel...

1848
02:03:55,861 --> 02:03:58,887
...where he had order four Pav
Bhaji takeaways.

1849
02:03:59,064 --> 02:04:02,227
Again, they ate pav bhaji there.

1850
02:04:02,568 --> 02:04:04,900
They made friends with the owner
while paying the bill.

1851
02:04:05,104 --> 02:04:06,594
Then, they watched a film.

1852
02:04:06,705 --> 02:04:09,538
They got acquainted
with the projectionist.

1853
02:04:11,677 --> 02:04:14,442
Later, while withdrawing money
from the ATM at the bus stand...

1854
02:04:14,547 --> 02:04:16,242
...Vijay got off the bus.

1855
02:04:18,617 --> 02:04:19,982
But, he didn't enter the ATM.

1856
02:04:24,190 --> 02:04:27,490
They made 'friends with 'the
conductor on 'the Kadamba bus.

1857
02:04:28,961 --> 02:04:30,451
They got back home and
a few days later...

1858
02:04:30,629 --> 02:04:34,657
...Vijay watched the sermon
with his family.

1859
02:04:34,900 --> 02:04:38,063
Then, he destroyed all
the bills for the fifth.

1860
02:04:38,504 --> 02:04:42,372
He showed us bills for the 3rd.

1861
02:04:43,142 --> 02:04:46,544
A few days later he went back
to Panaji with his family.

1862
02:04:47,112 --> 02:04:48,807
He met everyone, once again.

1863
02:04:49,415 --> 02:04:52,180
Then, he very cleverly,
talked to them...

1864
02:04:52,384 --> 02:04:54,978
...and implied...

1865
02:04:55,454 --> 02:04:59,550
mthat, he and his family went
to Panaji on the 2nd for a sermon.

1866
02:04:59,992 --> 02:05:02,461
He got back on the evening
of 3rd October.

1867
02:05:02,962 --> 02:05:06,398
So, they all didn't realize they
were giving false testimonies.

1868
02:05:11,737 --> 02:05:13,933
They kept thinking
they were telling the truth.

1869
02:05:19,078 --> 02:05:20,773
Master stroke.

1870
02:05:25,851 --> 02:05:27,842
So, Vijay Salgaonkar...

1871
02:05:29,955 --> 02:05:32,788
...mocked the entire
police department.

1872
02:05:33,659 --> 02:05:36,890
And despite knowing
about all of that...

1873
02:05:36,996 --> 02:05:40,660
...we have no proof or evidence
against him.

1874
02:05:41,867 --> 02:05:43,699
All we have is a theory.

1875
02:05:48,507 --> 02:05:51,033
Without proof or witnesses...

1876
02:05:51,710 --> 02:05:54,202
...a confession is
the greatest evidence.

1877
02:05:55,548 --> 02:05:56,640
What do you mean?

1878
02:05:58,050 --> 02:05:59,745
Where are you taking me'?
- Come on!

1879
02:05:59,818 --> 02:06:01,513
Let him go!
- Come on!

1880
02:06:01,620 --> 02:06:03,782
Don't shout!
- Come on.

1881
02:06:03,856 --> 02:06:05,449
Let me go, sir.
- Get in.

1882
02:06:05,524 --> 02:06:07,959
Take them all away!
- Get in, come on!

1883
02:06:08,027 --> 02:06:09,620
How can they take them away?

1884
02:06:09,695 --> 02:06:11,185
Let us go!

1885
02:06:19,538 --> 02:06:21,267
I will need your help.

1886
02:06:22,508 --> 02:06:25,443
What do you want me to do?
- h' the police takes us again...

1887
02:06:27,079 --> 02:06:28,604
...just call these people.

1888
02:06:56,075 --> 02:06:57,372
Where is my son?

1889
02:06:58,877 --> 02:07:00,106
I don't know.

1890
02:07:01,380 --> 02:07:03,212
We weren't at home.

1891
02:07:05,017 --> 02:07:07,247
Do you think, the police are fools'?

1892
02:07:07,953 --> 02:07:10,422
We have figured out your
plan, Vijay.

1893
02:07:10,556 --> 02:07:12,490
Ifs no use lying, now.

1894
02:07:12,791 --> 02:07:15,123
We know, you were
not in Panaji on the 2nd or 3rd.

1895
02:07:15,327 --> 02:07:17,056
You were there on the 4th and
the 5th.

1896
02:07:18,263 --> 02:07:20,698
You didn't attend any sermon.

1897
02:07:31,710 --> 02:07:33,542
Why did my son come to
meet you?

1898
02:07:35,214 --> 02:07:36,978
What happened with
the two of you?

1899
02:07:37,716 --> 02:07:41,152
I never met Sam after
the camp. Really.

1900
02:07:42,321 --> 02:07:43,584
Listen to me.

1901
02:07:44,390 --> 02:07:46,415
I've had enough
of your stories.

1902
02:07:46,625 --> 02:07:47,888
Ifs over.

1903
02:07:48,727 --> 02:07:51,162
You better tell me the truth.

1904
02:07:52,197 --> 02:07:54,859
Or we have other ways to
do this.

1905
02:07:56,301 --> 02:07:59,327
I'm telling the truth,
I don't know anything.

1906
02:08:12,818 --> 02:08:14,684
You know how I feel, don't you?

1907
02:08:15,387 --> 02:08:16,980
After all, you are a mom.

1908
02:08:17,890 --> 02:08:19,153
Tell me the truth.

1909
02:08:20,926 --> 02:08:23,395
My son came to meet your daughter
and vanished.

1910
02:08:24,763 --> 02:08:25,958
What happened with them'?

1911
02:08:27,066 --> 02:08:29,865
We have already told the truth.

1912
02:08:35,507 --> 02:08:36,406
Gaitonde!

1913
02:08:47,453 --> 02:08:48,978
Tell me, whafs the truth'?

1914
02:08:49,755 --> 02:08:51,018
Tell me!

1915
02:08:51,223 --> 02:08:52,190
Tell me, what is it'?

1916
02:08:52,291 --> 02:08:54,157
Please, don't!
- Get back!

1917
02:08:54,493 --> 02:08:55,961
Speak u I _ Dacup.

1918
02:08:58,297 --> 02:08:59,560
Tell me!

1919
02:09:04,703 --> 02:09:06,865
Let's see, how much you
can take.

1920
02:09:07,372 --> 02:09:10,467
Tell me!

1921
02:09:10,943 --> 02:09:12,104
Dad!

1922
02:09:13,712 --> 02:09:15,544
Tell me! Where is Sam?

1923
02:09:15,714 --> 02:09:17,443
Tell me!

1924
02:09:17,983 --> 02:09:19,348
Tell me!
- Don't hit him.

1925
02:09:19,451 --> 02:09:20,816
What the heck!

1926
02:09:22,321 --> 02:09:23,584
Tell me!

1927
02:09:25,758 --> 02:09:27,123
You better tell me.

1928
02:09:28,761 --> 02:09:30,286
Please, ma'am.

1929
02:09:30,629 --> 02:09:33,530
Please, tell him to stop.

1930
02:09:34,166 --> 02:09:36,225
Please!

1931
02:09:37,269 --> 02:09:38,566
Speak up!

1932
02:09:39,638 --> 02:09:40,935
Please!

1933
02:09:42,741 --> 02:09:43,867
Gaitonde!

1934
02:10:06,331 --> 02:10:07,799
Where is my son?

1935
02:10:15,374 --> 02:10:17,138
Speak up!
- Come on!

1936
02:10:17,242 --> 02:10:19,574
Come on, speak up!

1937
02:10:22,281 --> 02:10:23,578
Tell me!

1938
02:10:23,882 --> 02:10:25,350
Tell ma'am where her son is!

1939
02:10:25,450 --> 02:10:27,441
Tell her, where is Sam?

1940
02:10:27,853 --> 02:10:29,787
Tell her!
Speak up!

1941
02:10:31,723 --> 02:10:32,849
Tell her!

1942
02:10:35,828 --> 02:10:37,489
He came to meet you, right'?

1943
02:10:37,563 --> 02:10:39,793
Tell us where is Sam?
- Go on!

1944
02:10:39,865 --> 02:10:41,162
Speak up!
_

1945
02:10:46,672 --> 02:10:48,106
Tell us, where is Sam?

1946
02:10:50,175 --> 02:10:51,540
Alex is here.

1947
02:10:51,944 --> 02:10:53,070
Send him in.
- Tell us!

1948
02:10:55,948 --> 02:10:59,077
Tell us, where is Sam?
- Meera, tell them to stop, please.

1949
02:11:00,052 --> 02:11:02,487
Alex is here.
- Speak up!

1950
02:11:03,155 --> 02:11:04,316
Tell us, where is Sam?

1951
02:11:04,423 --> 02:11:05,686
Okay, stop it.

1952
02:11:11,797 --> 02:11:12,992
Come with me.

1953
02:11:25,811 --> 02:11:27,245
You...
- Gaitonde, stop it!

1954
02:11:30,382 --> 02:11:31,406
Get back.

1955
02:11:37,489 --> 02:11:40,151
Vijay, tell me what you know.

1956
02:11:42,394 --> 02:11:44,658
DO YPU people enjoy
Qefilng bashed up?

1957
02:11:47,366 --> 02:11:50,392
I'm telling the truth.
I don't know anything.

1958
02:11:52,938 --> 02:11:54,667
Do you know this girl'?

1959
02:11:56,642 --> 02:11:57,803
No, aunt.

1960
02:12:00,913 --> 02:12:04,247
Alex. Sam was with you
at the nature camp.

1961
02:12:05,550 --> 02:12:08,110
Sam is missing for 26 days.
You know that.

1962
02:12:09,021 --> 02:12:11,513
I am sure, she is connected
to his disappearance.

1963
02:12:11,590 --> 02:12:14,685
So, please, if you have
any information...

1964
02:12:14,793 --> 02:12:16,283
...do tell us, right now.

1965
02:12:16,728 --> 02:12:18,355
Uncle, I don't know anything.

1966
02:12:18,463 --> 02:12:22,491
You called Sam on the day
he vanished. Correct?

1967
02:12:23,001 --> 02:12:25,402
But, you refused to
admit to it the other day.

1968
02:12:26,638 --> 02:12:28,697
Are you going to tell me,
or should I tell them'?

1969
02:12:29,041 --> 02:12:32,102
Aunt, I spoke to him, but...

1970
02:12:32,344 --> 02:12:34,540
...he didn't tell me
where he was.

1971
02:12:34,613 --> 02:12:36,741
How is she connected to Sam?

1972
02:12:37,215 --> 02:12:39,274
Tell me, or I am going
to slap you.

1973
02:12:41,253 --> 02:12:42,414
<i>I'll</i> tell <i>you.</i>

1974
02:13:09,281 --> 02:13:10,407
Stay here.

1975
02:13:21,259 --> 02:13:22,727
Hey, bro! Send this to me.

1976
02:13:23,161 --> 02:13:24,993
Sorry, not yet.

1977
02:13:25,263 --> 02:13:27,732
Why? Send it!
- Not now.

1978
02:13:28,600 --> 02:13:30,932
First, I should make use of this.

1979
02:14:09,174 --> 02:14:11,370
Ma'am. There is a huge
crowd outside.

1980
02:14:12,244 --> 02:14:14,338
The media is asking for you.

1981
02:14:14,413 --> 02:14:15,642
Tell them to get lost.

1982
02:14:15,947 --> 02:14:17,346
Don't let them get in.

1983
02:14:17,416 --> 02:14:18,906
Call for reinforcements,
if needed.

1984
02:14:28,393 --> 02:14:29,588
Now what'?

1985
02:14:32,431 --> 02:14:33,921
What do we do?

1986
02:14:37,636 --> 02:14:39,001
We'll end this.

1987
02:14:44,943 --> 02:14:46,138
Go out, everyone.

1988
02:14:49,314 --> 02:14:50,804
Gaitonde, you stay here.

1989
02:14:57,622 --> 02:15:00,182
I found out about
the video clip.

1990
02:15:01,726 --> 02:15:03,091
Where is Sam?

1991
02:15:05,130 --> 02:15:06,757
We don't know, ma'am.

1992
02:15:07,566 --> 02:15:08,965
I'm telling the truth.

1993
02:15:19,478 --> 02:15:21,071
Gaitonde, I want the truth.

1994
02:15:22,280 --> 02:15:24,806
Do whatever it takes.
- Yes, ma'am.

1995
02:15:27,919 --> 02:15:29,114
You darn...

1996
02:15:29,321 --> 02:15:30,880
Where is Sam?

1997
02:15:31,423 --> 02:15:34,552
Tell me, where is Sam?
Tell me!

1998
02:15:34,793 --> 02:15:35,919
Tell me!

1999
02:15:37,629 --> 02:15:39,063
You tell me!

2000
02:15:39,831 --> 02:15:41,765
Tell me, where is Sam?
- No!

2001
02:15:41,833 --> 02:15:43,323
Where is Sam?
- Mom!

2002
02:15:43,401 --> 02:15:45,392
Tell me!
Don't you know?

2003
02:15:45,470 --> 02:15:46,528
Leave her.

2004
02:15:46,838 --> 02:15:48,203
You must know!

2005
02:15:48,607 --> 02:15:50,803
Tell me, what did you
do to Sam?

2006
02:15:50,876 --> 02:15:52,867
I don't know.
- You don't know?

2007
02:15:53,512 --> 02:15:55,310
Tell me!

2008
02:15:58,316 --> 02:15:59,841
Are you obstructing a police officer?

2009
02:16:00,752 --> 02:16:02,220
Are you holding
the police back?

2010
02:16:06,625 --> 02:16:08,286
You!
Get lost!

2011
02:16:09,928 --> 02:16:11,293
Are you holding
the police back?

2012
02:16:11,897 --> 02:16:13,456
Are you holding
the police back?

2013
02:16:13,665 --> 02:16:15,394
Are you holding
the police back?

2014
02:16:16,168 --> 02:16:18,535
Are you going to talk?

2015
02:16:18,637 --> 02:16:20,366
Tell me, where is Sam?

2016
02:16:20,472 --> 02:16:21,871
I don't know, sir.
- You don't know?

2017
02:16:21,973 --> 02:16:23,168
You don't know?

2018
02:16:23,275 --> 02:16:25,471
Listen, I am going
to kill all of you.

2019
02:16:26,378 --> 02:16:27,539
Tell me.

2020
02:16:27,979 --> 02:16:29,003
Won't you tell me'?

2021
02:16:29,080 --> 02:16:30,241
I don't know.

2022
02:16:30,649 --> 02:16:31,707
You don't know?

2023
02:16:31,816 --> 02:16:32,806
Tell me.
- Mom! No.

2024
02:16:33,385 --> 02:16:35,046
Meera, stop him.
Please.

2025
02:16:35,587 --> 02:16:37,351
Tell me.
Where is Sam?

2026
02:16:37,422 --> 02:16:38,753
I don't know.

2027
02:16:38,857 --> 02:16:40,052
You don't know?

2028
02:17:14,593 --> 02:17:17,824
Look! h' I hit them a bit
more...

2029
02:17:18,563 --> 02:17:21,828
...your mom, dad and sister
will die.

2030
02:17:23,802 --> 02:17:26,362
It you don't want that
tell the truth.

2031
02:17:27,839 --> 02:17:29,500
No...
- Tell us.

2032
02:17:32,377 --> 02:17:34,505
Tell me.

2033
02:17:39,351 --> 02:17:43,015
Listen, I'm going to kill
them all. Will that do?

2034
02:17:44,289 --> 02:17:45,620
Tell me, are you okay
with that'?

2035
02:18:00,672 --> 02:18:01,867
Gaitonde.

2036
02:18:07,679 --> 02:18:10,546
She won't speak before
the parents. Send them away.

2037
02:18:16,021 --> 02:18:17,352
Please.

2038
02:18:18,256 --> 02:18:22,750
H' you know anything about
Sam, tell us!

2039
02:18:29,401 --> 02:18:30,869
Where is Anu'?

2040
02:18:32,170 --> 02:18:33,660
My daughter is in there.
- Wait.

2041
02:18:33,772 --> 02:18:35,137
But, my daughter is in there...
- You can't go in.

2042
02:18:35,206 --> 02:18:36,537
My daughter is in there.
- Wait.

2043
02:18:38,877 --> 02:18:40,811
Did he come to your house?

2044
02:18:40,879 --> 02:18:42,472
I don't know, uncle.

2045
02:18:42,547 --> 02:18:45,573
I want to go to my parents.

2046
02:18:45,684 --> 02:18:49,882
Be honest then,
I will take you to your parents.

2047
02:18:56,094 --> 02:18:59,621
You better be honest,
or I am going to get upset.

2048
02:18:59,998 --> 02:19:03,059
When I get angry...

2049
02:19:03,635 --> 02:19:05,262
...you know, what I can do.

2050
02:19:06,638 --> 02:19:09,938
Tell me the truth
or I am going to kill you!

2051
02:19:11,309 --> 02:19:14,040
We should tell them the truth.

2052
02:19:15,347 --> 02:19:17,338
Gaitonde is a monster.

2053
02:19:17,816 --> 02:19:21,047
What if something
happens to Anu'?

2054
02:19:21,720 --> 02:19:23,586
I am really scared, now.

2055
02:19:23,755 --> 02:19:25,780
I am going to confess.

2056
02:19:25,890 --> 02:19:27,949
Then, everything will be fine, right'?
- No, Nandini.

2057
02:19:29,761 --> 02:19:31,627
Why did we suffer so much'?

2058
02:19:32,997 --> 02:19:34,761
Why did we take the beatings?

2059
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:37,468
So we could give in'?

2060
02:19:40,105 --> 02:19:43,632
I promised you, none
of you will go to prison.

2061
02:19:45,143 --> 02:19:46,872
I will keep my promise.

2062
02:19:50,014 --> 02:19:51,413
Anu...

2063
02:19:57,389 --> 02:19:59,619
Anu...
- Don't worry about Anu.

2064
02:20:01,826 --> 02:20:03,419
She's a brave girl.

2065
02:20:03,928 --> 02:20:06,590
Tell me, what is the truth'?
- Uncle, I don't know!

2066
02:20:06,664 --> 02:20:09,065
I want to go to my mom and dad!

2067
02:20:09,134 --> 02:20:11,967
Meera, this is it.
Just stop him! Enough is enough!

2068
02:20:12,036 --> 02:20:13,697
What we're doing here is illegal!

2069
02:20:13,805 --> 02:20:16,103
What about my son?
Who is going to look for him?

2070
02:20:16,174 --> 02:20:18,370
We have to look for him
but this is not the way!

2071
02:20:18,543 --> 02:20:19,669
Who does this?

2072
02:20:19,744 --> 02:20:21,576
At least, have mercy on that child.

2073
02:20:22,080 --> 02:20:23,844
What are you doing to her'?

2074
02:20:24,048 --> 02:20:25,482
And what's going 'to happen
after all this?

2075
02:20:25,550 --> 02:20:27,678
Did anyone tell you anything'?

2076
02:20:29,120 --> 02:20:31,020
I tell you after all this,
if we find out that...

2077
02:20:31,089 --> 02:20:34,457
...this family is innocent,
we will really regret it.

2078
02:20:35,794 --> 02:20:39,890
I mean, just consider for a moment,
what if Gaitonde is mistaken?

2079
02:20:41,099 --> 02:20:42,726
Tell me the truth!

2080
02:20:42,801 --> 02:20:45,133
Tell me!
- Gaitonde! No!

2081
02:20:46,137 --> 02:20:48,003
Don't hit me!

2082
02:20:48,106 --> 02:20:50,097
I will tell you.

2083
02:20:55,180 --> 02:20:56,477
<i>Mgr“!</i>

2084
02:20:57,248 --> 02:20:58,511
<i>An“!</i>

2085
02:21:06,191 --> 02:21:07,556
Where are you taking my
daughter?

2086
02:21:07,625 --> 02:21:09,389
Your daughter is taking us.

2087
02:21:09,727 --> 02:21:11,821
Where you buried the boy.

2088
02:21:12,630 --> 02:21:16,123
Your game is up, Vijay Salgaonkar.
All done.

2089
02:21:16,634 --> 02:21:20,264
Now, your next family
trip is going to be in prison.

2090
02:21:21,673 --> 02:21:24,973
Hey, get them all into the jeep.

2091
02:21:55,306 --> 02:21:57,001
Get back!
Come on.

2092
02:21:57,108 --> 02:21:58,633
Come on.

2093
02:21:59,344 --> 02:22:00,368
Come on.

2094
02:22:00,478 --> 02:22:02,469
Alright, let's go.

2095
02:22:03,515 --> 02:22:05,506
Come on, get back.

2096
02:22:05,583 --> 02:22:08,382
Get back.
Come on, Let's go.

2097
02:22:08,820 --> 02:22:10,015
Wait!
- Come on.

2098
02:22:10,088 --> 02:22:11,954
Let us go in.

2099
02:22:12,056 --> 02:22:13,387
He's our son.

2100
02:22:13,458 --> 02:22:15,756
No one is allowed
to meet the accused.

2101
02:22:15,827 --> 02:22:17,955
Accused? What has he done'?

2102
02:22:18,162 --> 02:22:19,493
Wait. You'll find out.

2103
02:22:19,597 --> 02:22:22,623
Ma'am. Gaitonde did this.

2104
02:22:22,734 --> 02:22:25,328
Vijay stood up to him.
Gaitonde wants revenge.

2105
02:22:25,436 --> 02:22:26,926
Uncle, what's going on here?

2106
02:22:27,005 --> 02:22:28,166
We don't know yet.

2107
02:22:28,273 --> 02:22:29,798
They won't even tell
us anything.

2108
02:22:29,874 --> 02:22:31,467
That's my daughter
and son-in-law.

2109
02:22:31,543 --> 02:22:34,035
The police remanded them
without any call, a few days back.

2110
02:22:34,245 --> 02:22:35,679
They were interrogated.

2111
02:22:35,747 --> 02:22:37,408
Inte rrogated?
About what'?

2112
02:22:37,515 --> 02:22:40,678
The lG's son is missing.
It's about him.

2113
02:22:40,885 --> 02:22:41,909
Who are you?

2114
02:22:42,020 --> 02:22:43,579
This is my son.

2115
02:22:43,688 --> 02:22:45,952
We all know Vijay
and his family.

2116
02:22:46,057 --> 02:22:49,118
They are good people.
They are being framed here.

2117
02:22:49,627 --> 02:22:51,721
Gaitonde, the man next
to Mr. Prabhu...

2118
02:22:51,796 --> 02:22:53,264
...has been responsible for this!

2119
02:23:34,372 --> 02:23:35,771
Meera!

2120
02:23:43,414 --> 02:23:44,813
Yo u o Kay?

2121
02:24:05,603 --> 02:24:06,832
<i>An“!</i>

2122
02:24:13,478 --> 02:24:15,503
Sorry, dad.
I was scared.

2123
02:24:15,580 --> 02:24:17,571
That's why, I told them.

2124
02:24:18,116 --> 02:24:19,413
That's okay, dear.

2125
02:24:22,420 --> 02:24:23,888
He hit you?

2126
02:24:24,222 --> 02:24:25,519
Yes.

2127
02:24:27,258 --> 02:24:29,124
Don't be scared.
I'm with you.

2128
02:25:40,164 --> 02:25:43,327
Meera. Meera, please.
Please...

2129
02:25:46,003 --> 02:25:48,472
Rajesh, Gaitonde hit us.

2130
02:25:48,539 --> 02:25:49,870
He hit our baby Anu.

2131
02:25:50,441 --> 02:25:53,240
We are innocent and still we
were thrashed in the room.

2132
02:25:53,344 --> 02:25:54,869
Gaitonde did it!

2133
02:25:55,213 --> 02:25:56,647
Wait, Gaitonde!

2134
02:25:56,714 --> 02:25:58,045
What the heck! You...

2135
02:25:58,149 --> 02:25:59,548
He hit my daughter.

2136
02:25:59,617 --> 02:26:01,915
Don't touch him, okay?
- Who are you? Get lost.

2137
02:26:02,019 --> 02:26:04,750
You hit a little girl!
Hit him!

2138
02:26:04,856 --> 02:26:06,551
He hit a little girl!
- Sawant!

2139
02:26:06,624 --> 02:26:07,921
Hit him!

2140
02:26:08,226 --> 02:26:09,660
He hit Anu!
- Ma'am. Sir.

2141
02:26:09,761 --> 02:26:11,559
Hit him!
- Meera, come, lefs go.

2142
02:26:11,996 --> 02:26:14,931
Hit him!
He hit a little girl!

2143
02:26:15,233 --> 02:26:16,997
Don't you dare touch the child.

2144
02:26:17,101 --> 02:26:18,364
Hit him!

2145
02:26:19,003 --> 02:26:20,437
He hit a little girl!

2146
02:26:40,358 --> 02:26:44,591
In <i>'the case oi 'the missing Sam
Deshnnukh, son oi 'the Goa</i> IG...

2147
02:26:44,662 --> 02:26:47,632
...the police has
brutally tortured...

2148
02:26:47,732 --> 02:26:50,997
...Vijay Salgaonkar and
his family despite their innocence.

2149
02:26:51,102 --> 02:26:54,265
There is hostility
all over, against them.

2150
02:26:54,338 --> 02:26:56,329
After 'this incident, 'the Pondolem
police station...

2151
02:26:56,440 --> 02:26:59,171
...Sl Gaitonde has been
suspended.

2152
02:26:59,243 --> 02:27:01,507
Orders have been sent
out for further investigation.

2153
02:27:01,579 --> 02:27:04,071
Senior Pl Prabhu and
the officers on this case...

2154
02:27:04,182 --> 02:27:06,480
...have all been transferred
out at once.

2155
02:27:06,551 --> 02:27:10,419
The DGP has sent IG Meera Deshmukh,
on an indefinite leave.

2156
02:27:10,521 --> 02:27:13,855
In its verdict on a PIL,
the court has decreed...

2157
02:27:13,925 --> 02:27:16,792
mthat if the police...

2158
02:27:16,894 --> 02:27:19,761
mwants to interrogate Vijay
Salgaonkar or his family...

2159
02:27:19,831 --> 02:27:22,061
...they need court orders
to do so.

2160
02:27:25,136 --> 02:27:26,331
Vi] 8y -

2161
02:27:34,545 --> 02:27:36,479
Vijay, don't you think that...

2162
02:27:37,281 --> 02:27:39,613
...their lives are completely
ruined'?

2163
02:27:40,218 --> 02:27:42,243
Anyway, it wasn't her fault.

2164
02:27:44,255 --> 02:27:46,747
She was an IG and a mother.

2165
02:27:47,358 --> 02:27:50,726
I feel as if we did the crime
and she paid for it.

2166
02:27:54,332 --> 02:27:56,426
Ifs good of you
to feel that way.

2167
02:27:58,035 --> 02:27:59,969
But, if it were Anju
instead of Sam...

2168
02:28:00,338 --> 02:28:01,772
...and vice versa...

2169
02:28:03,174 --> 02:28:05,734
...wouldn't IG Meera try
to save her son?

2170
02:28:07,144 --> 02:28:08,543
Of course, she would.

2171
02:28:09,413 --> 02:28:11,313
There's nothing wrong
or right about this.

2172
02:28:14,218 --> 02:28:16,380
A person can't live without
his family.

2173
02:28:17,421 --> 02:28:19,082
He can go to any extent
for his family.

2174
02:28:20,758 --> 02:28:24,717
The world may call him
self sewing or selfish.

2175
02:28:27,431 --> 02:28:29,661
I guess, ifs best to
forget about this.

2176
02:28:31,035 --> 02:28:35,700
Vijay, when did you
get 'the corpse out oi 'the pit?

2177
02:28:36,240 --> 02:28:39,039
After I got back
from disposing Sam's car.

2178
02:28:40,177 --> 02:28:41,667
On Sunday night.

2179
02:28:44,048 --> 02:28:45,413
Where did you bury it'?

2180
02:29:06,370 --> 02:29:08,338
I have kept that secret
safe in my heart.

2181
02:29:09,106 --> 02:29:10,767
That is best for all of us.

2182
02:29:11,475 --> 02:29:13,569
I will take it with me,
when I die.

2183
02:29:18,215 --> 02:29:20,013
Did you hope that Anu...

2184
02:29:20,885 --> 02:29:24,685
...would bear it all without
giving in till the end?

2185
02:29:26,691 --> 02:29:27,886
No.

2186
02:29:29,493 --> 02:29:33,327
I didn't think the three ot you
could keep it together tor so long.

2187
02:29:34,899 --> 02:29:37,163
Anu could have spoken
up earlier.

2188
02:29:38,536 --> 02:29:39,765
Poor Anu.

2189
02:29:43,507 --> 02:29:45,669
You've suffered a lot
because of me.

2190
02:29:46,077 --> 02:29:48,171
Dad, the police is here.

2191
02:29:58,422 --> 02:29:59,548
Why are you here?

2192
02:29:59,623 --> 02:30:00,954
Are you back to harass them'?

2193
02:30:01,158 --> 02:30:02,557
We just want to talk to Vijay.

2194
02:30:02,626 --> 02:30:04,116
Do you have a court order?

2195
02:30:11,002 --> 02:30:13,494
What's up, Vijay?
- It's okay, you leave.

2196
02:30:14,405 --> 02:30:15,873
I'm going to change
and be with you.

2197
02:30:51,776 --> 02:30:53,141
We are not here...

2198
02:30:54,612 --> 02:30:59,482
...as 'the IG, 'the police
or a businessman.

2199
02:31:01,318 --> 02:31:03,082
We are here as parents.

2200
02:31:06,457 --> 02:31:09,119
We had given up hope
of being parents. But then...

2201
02:31:10,528 --> 02:31:12,428
...we suddenly had a son.

2202
02:31:13,731 --> 02:31:14,960
Our only son.

2203
02:31:15,666 --> 02:31:18,795
I guess, that's why we
pampered him so much that...

2204
02:31:21,772 --> 02:31:23,467
...we are regretting it today.

2205
02:31:30,815 --> 02:31:33,375
Vijay, when we thought
about it we realized...

2206
02:31:35,252 --> 02:31:38,552
...whatever our son has
experienced...

2207
02:31:39,290 --> 02:31:40,587
...or not...

2208
02:31:41,792 --> 02:31:43,487
...is perhaps, our own fault.

2209
02:31:44,295 --> 02:31:48,095
We pampered him no end
and ruined him.

2210
02:31:51,769 --> 02:31:53,430
That's why we wanted to
meet you, too.

2211
02:31:55,506 --> 02:31:57,201
Inadvertently...

2212
02:31:58,042 --> 02:32:00,739
...we have harassed you
and your family a lot.

2213
02:32:02,346 --> 02:32:03,711
Sorry.

2214
02:32:06,350 --> 02:32:07,749
We are sorry.

2215
02:32:09,186 --> 02:32:10,551
We are really sorry.

2216
02:32:14,258 --> 02:32:16,226
We are leaving the country.

2217
02:32:17,328 --> 02:32:20,320
To London. To live with
her brother.

2218
02:32:22,099 --> 02:32:23,931
But, before we leave, Vijay...

2219
02:32:28,272 --> 02:32:30,138
...just tell us...

2220
02:32:30,908 --> 02:32:32,569
...what happened to Sam?

2221
02:32:38,716 --> 02:32:42,778
Whenever there is a call
we think, ifs Sam.

2222
02:32:44,188 --> 02:32:47,590
When the doorbell rings, it feels
like he's there.

2223
02:32:51,462 --> 02:32:53,556
We can't bear the suspense.

2224
02:32:55,099 --> 02:32:56,965
We can't live like this.

2225
02:32:57,701 --> 02:32:59,260
Just tell us, should we...

2226
02:33:03,874 --> 02:33:05,865
...wait for him?

2227
02:33:08,212 --> 02:33:09,475
Or...

2228
02:33:15,052 --> 02:33:16,110
That's all.

2229
02:33:28,966 --> 02:33:30,491
No, Meera.

2230
02:33:31,802 --> 02:33:33,201
Ifs not your fault.

2231
02:33:35,239 --> 02:33:36,707
I can understand.

2232
02:33:39,009 --> 02:33:40,568
Why would you trust us'?

2233
02:33:41,545 --> 02:33:44,139
We are sorry, again.
Sorry.

2234
02:33:44,615 --> 02:33:45,810
Come, lefs go.

2235
02:33:54,058 --> 02:33:55,457
Meera, let's go!

2236
02:33:55,926 --> 02:33:57,394
We are sorry, too.

2237
02:34:02,866 --> 02:34:06,530
I wish, I was as generous as you.

2238
02:34:08,572 --> 02:34:10,836
But, I am merely a fourth
grade dropout.

2239
02:34:12,209 --> 02:34:13,677
I have a wife.

2240
02:34:14,311 --> 02:34:15,676
I have two daughters.

2241
02:34:16,046 --> 02:34:17,343
And that's the extent of my world.

2242
02:34:17,815 --> 02:34:19,977
I have never thought
beyond that.

2243
02:34:21,218 --> 02:34:22,777
One day, my world...

2244
02:34:23,520 --> 02:34:25,511
...saw an unwanted guest enter.

2245
02:34:25,856 --> 02:34:27,585
He wanted to...

2246
02:34:28,859 --> 02:34:30,486
mdisrupt our world.

2247
02:34:33,998 --> 02:34:35,989
We tried to stop him.

2248
02:34:36,400 --> 02:34:37,765
We begged him.

2249
02:34:39,837 --> 02:34:41,305
But, he didn't listen.

2250
02:34:43,774 --> 02:34:45,037
Then, somehow...

2251
02:34:46,377 --> 02:34:47,811
...a tragedy occurs.

2252
02:34:52,483 --> 02:34:55,851
We send the unwanted guest...

2253
02:34:57,421 --> 02:35:00,391
...to a place, from where
there is no coming back.

2254
02:35:20,177 --> 02:35:22,976
We have given you the
greatest anguish in the world.

2255
02:35:26,517 --> 02:35:28,679
I tried to say sorry
many times.

2256
02:35:30,187 --> 02:35:31,916
I did so, in my heart.

2257
02:35:33,691 --> 02:35:35,386
What else could we do?

2258
02:35:36,760 --> 02:35:39,058
My family is most important
to me.

2259
02:35:40,898 --> 02:35:42,491
I could do anything for them.

2260
02:35:43,300 --> 02:35:44,699
I could go to any extent.

2261
02:35:46,370 --> 02:35:50,773
At that moment, I lose
sight of right or wrong.

2262
02:35:57,715 --> 02:35:59,046
We are sorry.

2263
02:36:47,831 --> 02:36:50,300
Listen to me.
Sir has called you.

2264
02:36:54,304 --> 02:36:56,500
Sir, I'm going to keep
my bags in the quarters.

2265
02:36:58,375 --> 02:37:00,969
Sir, this is Vijay Salgaonkar.

2266
02:37:02,246 --> 02:37:03,509
I know.

2267
02:37:03,747 --> 02:37:05,408
I have seen you on the TV.

2268
02:37:06,216 --> 02:37:08,617
Here you are.
Sign that.

2269
02:37:11,688 --> 02:37:13,622
You must be feeling
really proud.

2270
02:37:14,091 --> 02:37:15,991
You have fooled the police
and all that.

2271
02:37:16,960 --> 02:37:18,223
You just wait.

2272
02:37:18,362 --> 02:37:21,730
Once the corpse is found,
then we shall see.

2273
02:37:22,332 --> 02:37:25,358
I am going to be here
for a couple of years.

2274
02:37:26,470 --> 02:37:28,268
I am going to find it.

2275
02:37:29,506 --> 02:37:30,940
No, sir.

2276
02:37:31,475 --> 02:37:33,534
Who am I to fool the police?

2277
02:37:35,412 --> 02:37:37,574
I respect the police.

2278
02:37:38,449 --> 02:37:41,384
I think, the police protects us.
- Right.

2279
02:37:42,786 --> 02:37:44,515
I believe...

2280
02:37:45,189 --> 02:37:47,954
...you and your police station...

2281
02:37:48,859 --> 02:37:50,623
...will always protect us.

2282
02:37:52,463 --> 02:37:53,794
<i>I'll</i> leave, now.

2283
02:38:41,411 --> 02:38:43,743
The slab has been laid at
the police station.

2284
02:38:44,081 --> 02:38:45,981
The flooring will be laid on Monday.
