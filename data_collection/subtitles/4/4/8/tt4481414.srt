1
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,668
Hey! Come on.
Let's move!

2
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,795
No!

3
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,438
- Let me see.
- No!

4
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,238
Come on. I made you
a special breakfast.

5
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,549
You can't cook.

6
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,234
Hey, Mary, open up!

7
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,919
You look beautiful.

8
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,792
I look like a Disney character.

9
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,992
Where's the "special"?

10
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,160
The what?

11
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,840
You said you made me
a special breakfast.

12
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,952
Please don't make me go.

13
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,270
You can keep homeschooling me.

14
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,856
I've taught you
everything I know.

15
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,074
But I don't wanna go.

16
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,396
Well, I don't wanna go
to work, but I do.

17
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,437
You don't go to work.
You fix the boats on a dock.

18
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,549
Okay. It's a poor example,
but you're still going.

19
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,308
But what about Fred?

20
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,435
What about him?

21
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,656
You won't
take care of him.

22
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,749
You don't like cats.

23
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,976
I don't like two-eyed cats.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,240
Fred, as you know,
is monocular.

25
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,880
Who's gonna throw him
his ping pong ball?

26
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,800
Fred's gonna be fine.
No more argument, okay?

27
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,393
We've discussed this
ad nauseam.

28
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,909
What's ad nauseam?

29
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,308
Oh, you don't know?

30
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,920
Well, looks like
someone needs school.

31
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,033
This is gonna be fun.

32
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,360
You're gonna meet kids today

33
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,595
you can borrow money from
the rest of your life.

34
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,109
Come on.

35
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,759
You're gonna be great.

36
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,594
You know, just...

37
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,958
I don't know. Try bein' a kid.

38
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,075
Mmm-mmm.

39
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,955
Frank!

40
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,873
Frank, I know you hear me.

41
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,914
Frank!

42
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,959
There's still time
for you to undo this nonsense.

43
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,509
Go get in your car
and go get that child.

44
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,960
Are you technically allowed to

45
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,473
use those keys
whenever you want?

46
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,232
How can you stand there...

47
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,656
acting all calm
and everything, Frank,

48
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,749
and make light of this?

49
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,591
Now go get her back
before it's too late.

50
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,856
She gotta get out
in the world.

51
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,960
She has no friends her age.

52
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,433
No social skills.

53
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,475
She doesn't know
how to be a kid.

54
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,039
Two nights ago,
she told me

55
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,536
that even if Germany
bails out the euro...

56
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,869
there could still be
a worldwide depression.

57
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,680
I was staring at the ceiling
for three hours.

58
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,389
I'm so worried.

59
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,270
Come on, Roberta.

60
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,555
If you start crying,

61
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,280
I'm gonna have to
pretend to start crying.

62
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,754
Hey.

63
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,350
You know, there's something
you could be overlookin'.

64
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,315
This could work out.

65
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,995
Maybe.

66
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,990
But if anybody takes
that baby away...

67
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,430
I'll smother you
in your sleep.

68
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,393
Morning, Fred.

69
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,716
One plus one is two.

70
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,831
That is fact number one
of today.

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,356
Who can tell me
what two plus two is?

72
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,714
Who's got it?

73
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,914
- Mmm-hmm?
- Four.

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Excellent, Donna.

75
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,992
It is. Two plus two is,
indeed, four.

76
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,434
Okay, who wants to try
three plus three?

77
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,038
Three plus three? Really?

78
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,869
I beg your pardon?

79
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,511
What kinda school
is this anyway?

80
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,318
It's the kind of school

81
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,595
where students don't speak
without permission.

82
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,513
All right.
But everyone knows it's six.

83
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,118
Nobody in this classroom
speaks...

84
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,669
unless they are called upon.

85
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,950
Okay? Is everybody clear
on that?

86
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,917
Yes, ma'am.

87
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,594
Good. Mary, can you
stand up please?

88
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,511
Stand on up. Stand up, babe.

89
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,554
These questions are for you
because you're so advanced.

90
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,952
What is nine plus eight?

91
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,439
17.

92
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,678
Yeah. Yes, it is.
That's good.

93
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,948
What is...

94
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,348
15 plus 17?

95
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,953
32.

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,673
Yeah. That is right.

97
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,400
All right, then.

98
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,439
Well, what is 57 plus 135?

99
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,275
192.

100
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,389
Yeah.

101
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,309
Can you tell me...

102
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:19,112
what 57 multiplied by 135 is?

103
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,635
Okay.

104
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,917
Who can tell me what four...

105
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,193
7,695.

106
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,592
I don't think
anyone can do that.

107
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,750
The square root is 87.7.

108
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,794
And change.

109
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,797
Now what does ad nauseam mean?

110
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,598
I have a very strange kid.

111
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,239
I have 27 strange kids.

112
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,475
Good morning.

113
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,936
Good morning, good morning,
good morning.

114
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,976
That's great, guys,
but take your seats, okay?

115
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,230
Oh, God. See ya.

116
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,400
Good morning, Ms. Stevenson.

117
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,675
Good morning.

118
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,558
Mind if I sit in?

119
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,720
Not at all!

120
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,358
Okay, class.

121
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,520
I have a treat for you.

122
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,958
I would like to introduce you
to our principal, Mrs. Davis.

123
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,951
Good morning, first graders.

124
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,237
Good morning, Mrs. Davis.

125
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,994
Are you ready
for a great year?

126
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,673
Yes!

127
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,513
Uh... Yes, Mary?

128
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,869
She's the boss?

129
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,320
Mrs. Davis is our principal.
Mm-kay...

130
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,794
Okay. Now I want you

131
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,296
to get on your phone
and call Frank...

132
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,231
and tell him to
get me out of here!

133
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,394
Wait a minute.
That's the dad? I know him.

134
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,630
I see him at Ferg's
almost every Friday night.

135
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,110
He's the quiet,
damaged hot guy.

136
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,994
What are you doing at Ferg's
every Friday night?

137
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,116
Trying to get picked up
by him.

138
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,872
Excuse me? Hi.

139
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,430
Oh. Look, it's my teacher.

140
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,319
Probably wants to remind me
what one plus one is.

141
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,435
Go to the car, okay?

142
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,834
- Hi.
- Hi.

143
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,536
Sorry to yell at you
and then chase you down.

144
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,629
It's okay. Mary's teacher?

145
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,994
Yes. I'm Bonnie Stevenson.

146
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,640
Frank. How are you?
Sorry about today.

147
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,160
I know she got
a little overexcited.

148
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,456
I think
it's just first day jitters.

149
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,515
Sure. Yeah.

150
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,256
We're running a little late
actually. We gotta get going.

151
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,555
Okay. I don't even wanna
talk about that.

152
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,312
- I'll keep you just a minute.
- Okay.

153
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,315
I think your daughter...

154
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,789
I think Mary might be gifted.

155
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,989
What?

156
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:47,153
Yeah. Today in Math,
she answered some really...

157
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,072
- Oh, no, no, no. That's...
- No, please.

158
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,416
- It's not gifted.
- Really difficult questions.

159
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,475
All right.

160
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,856
Just that
a seven-year-old would...

161
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,074
It's Trachtenberg.

162
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,116
- Jakow Trachtenberg.
- I'm sorry?

163
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,475
Spent seven years
in a Nazi concentration camp.

164
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,513
Developed a system
to rapidly solve problems.

165
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,793
It's the Trachtenberg method.

166
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,314
But she's...

167
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,870
I mean, she's seven though.

168
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,439
I learned it when I was eight.

169
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,393
Do I look gifted to you?

170
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,348
It's kind of gone out of vogue

171
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,635
since the invention
of the calculator...

172
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,195
but, uh, I can still win
a drink at a bar using it.

173
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,829
Sorry for today.

174
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,151
- Won't happen again.
- Okay.

175
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,356
Nice to meet you. Bonnie.

176
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,509
Frank.

177
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,194
Hmm.

178
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,096
For the record,
I didn't wanna go

179
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,712
to the stupid school
in the first place.

180
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,279
And the boy in the next row

181
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,033
acts inappropriately
for someone who's a child.

182
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,312
I'm sorry. I'm still passive
aggressively ignoring you.

183
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,680
Other kids answer questions.
They don't get into trouble.

184
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,990
You didn't get in trouble
for answering questions.

185
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,513
You yelled at the principal.

186
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,830
You know what? You're gonna
find this interesting.

187
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,281
So, I googled "first graders
who yell at the principal..."

188
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,736
and statistically,
you're never gonna

189
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,113
believe how many kids do it.

190
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,275
How many?

191
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,629
None.

192
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,073
Frank, I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

193
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,468
Yeah, right.

194
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,276
You can't show off
like that at school.

195
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,629
I know.

196
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,680
You promised you wouldn't,
then the first day...

197
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,756
I know, I know. I screwed up.

198
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,313
Do you think maybe
this boat needs a test ride?

199
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,395
Go get Fred.

200
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,079
Don't run.

201
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:06,631
I listen to the wind
To the wind of my soul

202
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,192
Where I'll end up
Well, I think

203
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,829
Only God really knows

204
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,953
I've sat upon the setting sun

205
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,119
But never, never, never, never

206
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,157
I never wanted water once

207
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,077
No, never, never, never

208
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,800
Fred loves to watch
the sandpipers.

209
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,717
He thinks he'd like to
catch one...

210
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,472
but he'd regret it.

211
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,311
Fred's not a killer.

212
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,959
He's a lover.

213
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,632
Would my mom have wanted me
to go to this school?

214
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,473
I can only guess.

215
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,920
But I'll tell you what,

216
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,718
she would have wanted you
to have friends.

217
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,712
Idiot friends?

218
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,828
And she'd want you to have
compassion for others.

219
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,879
Like a cat can have
for a sandpiper.

220
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,951
But what if
they don't like me?

221
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,274
Then they're idiots.

222
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,268
Good morning, class.

223
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,155
Good morning, Ms. Stevenson.

224
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,155
Good morning, Mary.

225
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,149
Good morning, Ms. Stevenson.

226
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,029
Okay, good morning.

227
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,959
Get a hold of yourself.

228
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,435
For my Show and Tell,
I have...

229
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,909
the most awesome cat
in the history of time.

230
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,517
Not only
is his name Fred, but...

231
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,193
He has just one eye.

232
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,396
Uno. Go ahead and count...

233
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,751
but I promise you,
it's always one.

234
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,433
How did he lose his eye?

235
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,835
I don't know. I wasn't there.

236
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,433
Just found him
inside of a trash can

237
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,512
next to a bottle of alcohol
or something.

238
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,877
He is a smart, smart cat,
but no one realizes that.

239
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,672
No one understands him.
No one.

240
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,595
Put your name
on the top of the paper...

241
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,718
so that I know
who did such good work.

242
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,120
I left my pen with you.

243
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,599
Pass those around, guys.

244
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,279
Okay? I wanna see your work.

245
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,476
Turn around, face the desk.

246
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,276
Think about
how you get to the answer.

247
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,274
It's not just about,
you know, guessing.

248
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,839
Don't be messy.

249
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,795
Done.

250
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,514
Let's see.

251
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,159
Mmm-hmm.

252
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,118
Okay. I thought
you might finish quickly,

253
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,679
so a little something extra.

254
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,509
Done.

255
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,194
Oh...

256
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,315
Do you know who I am?

257
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,956
Hey! Mary's teacher...

258
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,229
Bonnie.

259
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,992
You lied to me.

260
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,075
Okay.

261
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,111
- Can you narrow it down?
- Mmm-hmm.

262
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,511
I'd like to know the truth
about Mary, my student...

263
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,671
your niece.

264
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,314
I was running

265
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,674
ridiculously late for a date...

266
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,916
and my sister showed up
with Mary.

267
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,752
And she never just
showed up unannounced.

268
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,353
She never showed up
with the baby.

269
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,191
She said she wanted to talk.

270
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,998
She said she needed to talk.

271
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,915
I told her I would talk to her
when I got back.

272
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,120
I think I figured showing up
that late to my date...

273
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,037
would hurt my chances
of gettin' laid.

274
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,675
Came home that night
and Mary was on the couch...

275
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,513
and found Diane
on the bathroom floor.

276
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,956
I mean, there's no way
I coulda known...

277
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,592
but I shoulda known.

278
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,474
Six and a half years later,

279
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,073
me and Mary
are still hangin' out.

280
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,676
And what about the father?

281
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,272
Diane was
so socially awkward...

282
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,159
she didn't date enough to know
a good guy from a bad guy.

283
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,788
This particular guy
didn't last a month.

284
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,632
And no grandparents?

285
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:07,755
- Dad died when I was eight.
- My mom...

286
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,957
Short version is
she turned her back on Diane

287
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,234
when she got pregnant.

288
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,120
Why?

289
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,192
Didn't fit into her plan.

290
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,119
She's an exacting woman,
my mother.

291
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,077
Uncompromising.

292
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,195
Very British.

293
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,113
Do you mean,
British in demeanor or...

294
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,350
- No. Like she's...
- She's from England.

295
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,192
From England. Yeah.

296
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,432
So, Mary is a genius?

297
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,439
Oh!

298
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,113
Look out. Look out.

299
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,033
Your little animals
are escaping, dumbass.

300
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,112
Hey! You should not
be laughing!

301
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,349
You did a mean thing
to a little kid!

302
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,073
What are you gonna do
about it?

303
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,159
Hey. Hey, you okay?

304
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,713
You good? All right.

305
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,798
How do we resolve this?

306
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,472
You know,
she could be expelled.

307
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,355
God. I hope not.

308
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,715
But if every other first-time
offender was expelled,

309
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,869
I guess fair is fair.

310
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,712
Are you gonna
take this seriously?

311
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,475
Sure. You don't bluff me,
I don't bluff you.

312
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,638
Ms. Stevenson believes

313
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,676
that your child
is exceptional...

314
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,434
and has talents
that our curriculum

315
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,033
can't begin to challenge.

316
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,992
It just so happens

317
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,236
that I am good friends
with the headmaster

318
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,119
of the Oaks Academy
for Gifted Education.

319
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,508
He has always said

320
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,556
that if I find
that one in a million...

321
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,712
And the one in a million
has a $30,000 tuition.

322
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,516
Mr. Adler, I can get
your daughter a scholarship.

323
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,749
Full ride.

324
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,911
I wouldn't say it
if I couldn't do it.

325
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,711
I realize, putting that girl
in that setting,

326
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,917
you know, 99 times out of
a 100, that's what you do.

327
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,440
It's the Oaks.
It's a great school.

328
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,669
I looked into it.

329
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,835
But this family has a history
with those schools.

330
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,715
And I think the last thing
that little girl needs

331
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,314
is reinforcement
that she's different.

332
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,271
Trust me, she knows. So...

333
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,235
I think Mary,
I think she's gotta be here.

334
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,671
Today's a bad ending.
You can't hit people.

335
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,952
But a 12-year-old
bullies a seven-year-old

336
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,359
and she stands up?

337
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,136
Do you know how important
it is to me that she did that?

338
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,355
You know how proud I am
of her? Aren't you?

339
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,835
Mr. Adler, your daughter
shattered a young boy's...

340
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,195
I know. You can't hit people.

341
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,311
That will be made very clear.
I get that.

342
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,119
But Mrs. Davis,
if we separate our leaders,

343
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,756
if we segregate them
from people like you and me,

344
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,911
you get congressmen.

345
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,520
So, I'm sorry.

346
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,477
I wish I could take
your offer, but Mary stays.

347
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,709
Unless you kick her out.

348
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,718
This is a mistake. We'll never
be able to raise this child

349
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,514
to the level of scholarship
she deserves.

350
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,799
Well, just dumb her down
into a decent human being.

351
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,389
Everybody wins.

352
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,597
You know what?
Can you excuse me one minute?

353
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,278
Bring me
every piece of paperwork

354
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,753
we have on this girl.

355
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,960
Hey.

356
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,515
Are you sure
you know what you're doing?

357
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,520
No.

358
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,909
Okay. Mary, I think

359
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,656
you have something you'd like
to say to the class.

360
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,910
You wanna hop up and say it?

361
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,632
Okay. I'm supposed to
say something.

362
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:01,153
Hitting people is wrong
even if they're bad.

363
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,199
I won't do it again,
so don't be afraid of me.

364
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,756
Okay. Thank you.

365
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,354
Now can I say something
I wanna say?

366
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,120
Sure.

367
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,158
Before they ruined it,

368
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,880
Justin's zoo
was the best art project.

369
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,079
By far. It was awesome.

370
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,831
Come on. A little harder.

371
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,035
Okay.

372
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,358
Thank you. Thank you.

373
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,109
There's a lady standing
in front of our door.

374
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,355
Who is it?

375
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,715
How should I know? I'm seven.

376
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,830
That would be
your grandmother.

377
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,313
Holy shit!

378
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,189
An Apple? Whoa.

379
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,431
It's a MacBook, darling.

380
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,989
Top of the line
with the Retina Display.

381
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,993
Hey, you know who else
has a Retina Display?

382
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,115
Fred!

383
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,156
Mary, I understand
you like mathematics.

384
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,117
So, on there,

385
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,349
you'll find a great

386
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,914
out-of-print book
by Charles Zimmer

387
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,668
called Transitions
in Advanced Algebra.

388
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,430
Yeah. Love that book.

389
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,514
You're saying you've read it?

390
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,797
Yeah. I've kind of moved on
to differential equations now.

391
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,116
Don't forget your manners.
Thank your grandma.

392
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,508
Thank you, Grandma.

393
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,399
Grandmother or Evelyn
will do just fine.

394
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,353
There's so much more on there.

395
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,280
Things I know you'll find
really challenging.

396
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,032
Yes. But sadly,
it's a school night

397
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,439
and there's homework to do.

398
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,955
What a surprise though, right?

399
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,951
Say good night
to Grandmother or Evelyn.

400
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,113
Good night.

401
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,716
I'd kill a priest
for a Benadryl.

402
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,199
Still with the allergies?

403
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,191
Why in God's name
have you got a cat?

404
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,429
You don't even like cats.

405
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,192
It's not my cat.
It's Mary's cat.

406
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,679
I'm just along for the ride.

407
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,829
So let me guess.

408
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,558
Our lovely principal,
Ms. Davis.

409
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,950
Never get on the bad side
of small-minded people

410
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,473
who have a little authority.

411
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,278
I thought I taught you that.

412
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,029
What are you doin' here?

413
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,256
You don't think
I have the right

414
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,315
to see my granddaughter?

415
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,755
I do. I'm thrilled your
seven-year exhaustive search

416
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,315
has finally come
to a fruitful conclusion.

417
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,118
I don't think this is
an appropriate time to talk.

418
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,395
Certainly not the setting.

419
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,551
While I was waiting,
a cockroach this big

420
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,437
tried to steal my shoe.

421
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,596
Yeah. They'll take a shoe.

422
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,629
Honestly, this?

423
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,634
This godforsaken mosquito
ranch was a conscious choice?

424
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,749
I could drop you back off
at the airport.

425
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,830
This thing is loaded
with cool problems.

426
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,551
So, are you teaching?

427
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,948
I repair boats.

428
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,669
- Please.
- I'm not bad at it either.

429
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,592
Well, then,
that explains this.

430
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,876
They don't sell
sunscreen here?

431
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,075
I wear sunscreen.

432
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,475
Not enough.
And you need a hat.

433
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,393
A big hat that shades
your face and neck.

434
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,336
You're playing Russian
roulette with your skin.

435
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,679
You look like a porn producer.

436
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,354
Okay. I appreciate the advice.
I do.

437
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,416
But we're not here to talk
about sunscreen, are we?

438
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,193
Oh, so no more small talk?
That's a shame.

439
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,917
Okay. The environment you have
created for that child

440
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,798
where she lives,
the school she attends,

441
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,200
it's substandard,
every bit of it.

442
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,633
I disagree.

443
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,755
We're getting nowhere

444
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,976
if we're not gonna be honest
with each other.

445
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,752
I am being honest.

446
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,310
I see. Fine. Well, I'm not
leaving without her.

447
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,114
Well, welcome to Florida.

448
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,430
Frank, please listen
to reason.

449
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,909
At some point, either you're
gonna come to the conclusion,

450
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,069
or someone in authority

451
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,296
is going to spell it out
for you

452
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,595
that the child's best interest
is all that matters.

453
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,115
You're gonna make me
pull rank, I will.

454
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,679
Diane didn't want you
to have her.

455
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,555
Diane...

456
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,157
Diane didn't always
think things through.

457
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,256
Arguably one of the brightest
minds on the planet.

458
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,480
Good luck
going down that road.

459
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,800
And what do you think
she'd say

460
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,956
if she saw
how her child is living now?

461
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,031
Do you honestly think
she'd be pleased?

462
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,714
That she's living a somewhat
normal life? Yes. I do.

463
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,836
She's not normal.
And treating her as such...

464
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,718
is negligence
on a grand scale.

465
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,389
I know your heart's
in the right place on this.

466
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,111
But you are denying the girl
her potential. You are.

467
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,235
I can provide for her,
I can enrich her life.

468
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,280
Oh, come on, Evelyn.
You're gonna take that girl,

469
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,496
you're gonna bury her
in tutors...

470
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,376
then you're gonna loan her
out to some think tank...

471
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,958
where she can talk
non-trivial zeros...

472
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,136
with a bunch of old Russian
guys for the rest of her life.

473
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,957
And you'd bury her
under a rock.

474
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,640
Look, I don't expect you
to understand

475
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,280
the price you have to pay
for greatness.

476
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,352
Oh, I do. That's why I have
Mary in the first place.

477
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,239
That's uncalled for.

478
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,630
Your sister had
a laundry list of problems.

479
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,016
She could have solved
Navier-Stokes

480
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,120
and gone down in history...

481
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,120
as one of the greatest
mathematicians of all time.

482
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,355
But she didn't because
she couldn't finish.

483
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,953
She was weak.

484
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,917
Weak like her father
and weak like...

485
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,309
Well...

486
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,631
Now, if it's who I think
it is...

487
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,350
Kinda puts a black cloud
over our luncheon.

488
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,318
You're still stubborn
and vindictive.

489
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,634
Careful, Mother.

490
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,189
There's an apple and tree
analogy lurking.

491
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,632
You guys ready to order?

492
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,832
Here's an idea.

493
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,792
Stop thinking about me
and you...

494
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,275
and start thinking about
what's best for the child.

495
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,991
For any reasonable person,
a clear picture will emerge.

496
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,033
If it doesn't, I suggest
you call your attorney.

497
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,190
He'll have the bucket of beer.

498
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,317
Hey, let's go outside.

499
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,469
No.

500
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,598
Come on. It's nice out.

501
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,195
I don't care.

502
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,279
Hey, no more math today.

503
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,233
Is there a God?

504
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,719
I don't know.

505
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,154
Just tell me.

506
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,072
I would if I could.

507
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,834
But I don't know.
And neither does anybody else.

508
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,598
Roberta knows.

509
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,149
No.
Roberta has faith

510
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,833
and that's a great thing
to have.

511
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,831
But faith's about
what you think, feel.

512
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,239
Not what you know.

513
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,392
What about Jesus?

514
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,755
Love that guy.
Do what he says.

515
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,911
But is he God?

516
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,593
I don't know.

517
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,193
I have an opinion.

518
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,510
But that's my opinion.
I could be wrong.

519
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,398
So why would I screw up yours?

520
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,114
Use your head.

521
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,675
But don't be afraid
to believe in things either.

522
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,716
Huh.
There was a guy on TV

523
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,392
who said there was no God.

524
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,949
The only difference

525
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,640
between the atheists on TV
and Roberta...

526
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,910
is that Roberta loves you.
She's trying to help.

527
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,113
Tell you what though.

528
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,835
One way or another,

529
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,956
we all end up back together
in the end.

530
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,352
That's what
you're asking, right?

531
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,349
Yep.

532
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,829
Okay.

533
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,630
Find something else
to worry about, will you?

534
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,434
All right.

535
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,518
Okay. Adler,
grandmother and uncle.

536
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,875
Really?

537
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,280
You sure you folks
don't wanna go out

538
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,560
in the hallway
and settle this?

539
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,231
No? Well, that's a shame.

540
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,030
Mr. Cullen, you are here
for the uncle.

541
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,348
Yes, sir, Your Honor.

542
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,999
Start charging you room
and board.

543
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,195
Mr. Highsmith,

544
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,160
you're on the wrong side
of the bay, aren't you?

545
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,959
I'm very happy
to be here, Your Honor.

546
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,160
For the record,
Mrs. Dibbons

547
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,576
is representing
the State of Florida

548
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,828
Child Welfare Department.

549
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,069
Proceed.

550
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,958
Your Honor,
my client, Mrs. Adler

551
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,640
is the maternal grandmother
of the child.

552
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,079
Her daughter,
the girl's mother,

553
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,195
was a troubled woman...

554
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,510
who seven years ago,
sadly, took her own life.

555
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,636
It was at this time
that Mr. Adler

556
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,153
preemptively and illegally...

557
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,588
took custody of the girl

558
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,016
and spirited her
across state lines...

559
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,395
for the purpose
of denying my client custody.

560
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,080
Now, there is evidence that
the child currently lives...

561
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,038
in unclean
and unwholesome conditions.

562
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,117
We petition the court
to grant my client

563
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,320
full custody of the child...

564
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,560
so that she may be returned

565
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,959
to the state
of Massachusetts...

566
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,475
and given the care
to which she is entitled.

567
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:34,030
My client took an infant under
his wing for one reason only.

568
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,112
It was his sister's desire
that he do so.

569
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,350
My client has been
her constant caregiver.

570
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,456
And, Your Honor, as far as
the living conditions...

571
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,994
I've been in this home.
It's fine.

572
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,435
I mean, if we adopt standards
based on...

573
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,536
our northern friend's
aversion to palmetto bugs...

574
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,074
we won't have a child left
south of Tallahassee.

575
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,032
All right. Last chance
before this starts

576
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,798
costing a lot more money.

577
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,473
Your Honor,
my client would need

578
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,788
reasonable access
to the child.

579
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,189
So ordered.

580
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,416
Ms. Dibbons,
you'll go over there

581
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,656
and check out
the living conditions?

582
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,715
On the books, Your Honor.

583
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,512
All right, folks.
Drive carefully.

584
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,233
Her lawyer has a nice suit.

585
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,437
Relax, Frank. More weight's
put on the talent competition.

586
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,599
Go have a cocktail, hmm?

587
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,278
Roberta, would you
like to have Mary tonight?

588
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,110
Why wouldn't I like
to have Mary tonight?

589
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,671
I told you something like this
would happen.

590
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,439
Now look where we are.

591
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,416
And I'm supposed to believe
you know what you're doing.

592
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,920
You couldn't even find
a white lawyer.

593
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,757
Wow. Look, just...

594
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,040
- Don't worry, okay?
- Don't tell me that.

595
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,110
There's nothing you can say

596
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,456
that's gonna make me
feel good...

597
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,436
because I have no say
in any of this, Frank.

598
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,715
I'm not a blood relative,

599
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,438
I'm not a legal guardian.
I'm nothing!

600
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,000
Just the lady
who lives next door,

601
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,176
whose opinion means nothing...

602
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,952
whose feelings mean nothing.

603
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,348
Would I like to have
Mary tonight?

604
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,069
I'd like to have Mary
every night.

605
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,392
Can't stop me now
Hear what I say

606
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,758
My feets gotta move, so...

607
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,558
Get out of my way

608
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,790
I'm gonna have my say

609
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,793
I'm going to every discotheque

610
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,838
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
Whoo!

611
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,114
Till the break of day

612
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,716
Oh, shame, shame, shame, shame

613
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,875
Oh!

614
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,991
Shame on you

615
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,479
If you can't dance too

616
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,751
And I said shame, shame,
shame, shame

617
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,673
Shame, shame, shame
Shame on you

618
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,349
Hi.

619
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,760
Hi.

620
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:58,390
Um, I heard Davis bragging
about a custody case

621
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,913
and then I found out whose...

622
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,599
I feel terrible.

623
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,760
But I also wanted you to know
that after we talked...

624
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,552
I didn't say anything
to anyone.

625
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,517
I swear.

626
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,911
And it's, um, important to me
that you know that.

627
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,029
I know.

628
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,880
Okay.

629
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,190
My lawyer told me
to get drunk.

630
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,200
And you're trying to do it
with that?

631
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,352
Okay. My turn.

632
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,871
Who was your first
celebrity crush?

633
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,472
Um, I'll go with...

634
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,596
Mona from Who's the Boss?

635
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,715
Oh, wow!

636
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,896
You know
who I'm talking about?

637
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,416
- The sexy grandmother.
- Yeah!

638
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,840
I always felt like
she had a secret.

639
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,110
Yeah, which is that
she loved sexual intercourse.

640
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,200
That was it.

641
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,416
And she wasn't secret
about it.

642
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,829
That's why I liked her.

643
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,878
You know what?
I liked her, too.

644
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,229
See?

645
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,037
All right. Um...

646
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,068
Least favorite student.
And why.

647
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,879
Oh, no!
I love all my students.

648
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,476
I don't believe you.
At all! Not for a second.

649
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,908
No, they're all great.

650
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,798
They're all so great.

651
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,112
I'm gonna go ahead and drink.

652
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,759
Let's keep this honest.

653
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,194
He? She?

654
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,197
Uh, he is Ronnie Middleton.

655
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,313
Sounds like a dick.

656
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,155
- He's a little child, okay?
- I'm sorry.

657
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,959
The point is that he's evil
in his core.

658
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,078
And there's nothing I can do.

659
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,719
Wow.

660
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,279
What's your greatest fear?

661
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,714
Wow!

662
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,915
That's a change of tone.

663
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,832
Yup, I'm a really
serious person.

664
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,319
Okay.

665
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,953
Look, if it's too much, you
can just drink your drink...

666
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,955
and live with the fact
that you're afraid.

667
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,951
No, I can handle this. Um...

668
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,518
That I'll ruin Mary's life.

669
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,472
You're very, um...

670
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,557
surprising, Mary's teacher.

671
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,114
Very much so.

672
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,594
- Okay. Hold on. I'm sorry.
- What?

673
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,239
Just so that...

674
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,356
I feel like
I need to say this...

675
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,437
just so that
there's no misconception.

676
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,669
Oh, God. No, I didn't...

677
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,875
No, hold on!

678
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,873
That this can't,
isn't happening.

679
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,315
I get it. I know.
I'm with you.

680
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,596
- Yeah? Okay.
- 100%. We're on the same page.

681
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,829
Good!

682
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,797
No, that's great. I'm sorry.
That's embarrassing.

683
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,518
It's okay. I get it.

684
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,515
Oh!

685
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,511
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

686
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,635
Okay. Good.

687
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,438
Can you promise
that there's no way?

688
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,272
Yes. Roberta has Mary

689
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,536
every Saturday till noon,
I promise.

690
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,471
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

691
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:16,271
Mmm. Mmm-mmm. Sorry.

692
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,675
I can't do this.

693
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,558
Okay.

694
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,755
Okay.

695
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,394
I understand.

696
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,989
I'll take you home.

697
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,918
Yeah.

698
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,078
Sorry, just... One more time.

699
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,790
I can't find my DVD.

700
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,598
It's right there, baby.

701
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,478
No, it isn't.
You come and find it.

702
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,920
I'm doing lady business.

703
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,456
Now, you were the last person
to watch it.

704
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,515
What did you do with it?

705
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,348
Oh...

706
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,275
Oh! Oh, my God!

707
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:51,557
Good morning, Miss Stevenson.

708
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,994
Hi.

709
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,835
Look, I am...

710
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,536
Oh, you know what?
I'm actually incapable...

711
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,596
of having
this conversation right now.

712
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,955
Good. 'Cause I have no idea
what I was gonna say.

713
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,357
Great! Perfect!

714
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,557
Sir, if you please.
Take me to jail.

715
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,433
Awkward.

716
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,800
Mary...

717
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,029
Stop! Stop!

718
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,270
Stop with the Legos! Listen.

719
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,118
Do we have a rule
about Saturday morning?

720
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,514
What?

721
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,496
Are you allowed
in this apartment this early

722
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,720
on Saturday morning?
Yes or no?

723
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,432
- No.
- No!

724
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,154
Are you allowed to... Hey!

725
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,550
Stop! Enough with the Legos.

726
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,631
Are you allowed to
use Roberta's keys?

727
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,994
- No.
- No!

728
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,149
Hey! Look at me.

729
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,595
Then why are you here, huh?

730
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,349
Can you answer me that?

731
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,397
You broke every rule!

732
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,596
You just embarrassed me.

733
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,915
We have these rules.

734
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,116
We've gone over them
a hundred times! Ahh!

735
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,673
God!

736
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,398
Damn it!

737
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,670
Can I just get five minutes
of my own life?

738
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,270
Nothing that happened today
was your fault.

739
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,032
I got mad at you...

740
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,997
I was really mad at me.

741
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,672
And the manufacturers
of Legos,

742
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,113
they should all be in prison.

743
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,113
I'm sorry.

744
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,433
Do you forgive me?

745
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,119
Sure. Whatever.

746
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,115
Hey, close the laptop.
Come on.

747
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,359
Please. Doesn't count
if it's not eye to eye.

748
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,033
Come on, please.

749
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,430
Do you really have no life
because of me?

750
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,238
That's not what I said.

751
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,879
Hmm.

752
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,473
Did you mean it?

753
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,195
Last month you said I was

754
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,376
the worst uncle
in the world...

755
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,674
and you wished death upon me

756
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,000
'cause I didn't buy you
a piano.

757
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,999
Did you mean that?

758
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,593
No.

759
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,478
Not entirely.

760
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,275
There you go.

761
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,908
We say things all the time
we don't mean. So...

762
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,193
Let's forget it, okay?

763
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,280
Okay.

764
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,353
Okay.

765
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,029
Frank?

766
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,200
Yeah?

767
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,880
Can I have a piano?

768
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,075
No.

769
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,720
Was that really Mary's teacher
this morning?

770
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,360
You know, I got a book called

771
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,078
Fundamentals of
Decision Making.

772
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,389
You can borrow it.

773
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,559
What is it?

774
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,352
It's nothing.

775
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,034
Looks like Mary gets to go
to Boston for a couple days.

776
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,552
It's just two days.

777
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,440
Relax.

778
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,158
So, what do you think?

779
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,393
Cool.

780
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,350
Wow! You and my mom...

781
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,999
were always together.

782
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,355
Always.

783
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,717
Oh, no, you don't want
to look at that one.

784
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Is that you?

785
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,600
Yes.

786
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,354
How old were you?

787
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:34,880
29.

788
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,311
Where is this?

789
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,550
That's Cambridge University.

790
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,711
In England.

791
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,754
Who are those people?

792
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,717
My research colleagues.

793
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,709
For what?

794
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,677
Mathematics, of course.

795
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,032
Really?

796
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,512
Cool!

797
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,832
So, then you came to work...

798
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,149
at a college in America?

799
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,755
No.

800
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,639
I married your grandfather...

801
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,155
and I came back
to America with him.

802
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,191
And I had children.

803
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,634
Oh.

804
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,909
So, no more math?

805
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:23,915
It's late.

806
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,838
You've got a big day tomorrow.

807
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,958
Come on. Up, up, up.

808
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,479
Can I play the piano?

809
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,560
No, you can't.

810
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,296
- Now stop dragging those feet.
- But, it's fun!

811
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,320
Come on!

812
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:38,550
I have had
a series of nightmares...

813
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,995
where I'm fired...

814
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,554
because of what happened.

815
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,199
You get it?

816
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,279
And then I try
to rationalize...

817
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:52,115
that everything that happened
was just all alcohol.

818
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,991
I have an addiction
to fixer guys.

819
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,951
Dr. Shankland,
this problem is...

820
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:19,317
I know. Just copy it exactly
as you see it written.

821
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,675
But it's...

822
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,480
Exactly as written. Thank you.

823
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,434
So, what's this problem
I'm supposed to look at?

824
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,317
I don't know.

825
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,755
Is it like the problems
Mom worked on?

826
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,070
Your mother didn't work
on problems.

827
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,390
She worked on
just one problem.

828
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,312
Just one?

829
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,038
Her entire life?

830
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,918
Most of it.

831
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,274
Look.

832
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,032
These are
the Millennium Problems.

833
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:56,230
Seven great
and meaningful problems.

834
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,470
Some mathematicians
have worked

835
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,437
their entire lives
to prove them.

836
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,758
Who's the dude with the beard?

837
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,359
That's not a dude.

838
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,750
That's Grigori Perelman.

839
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,434
He proved
the Poincaré conjecture.

840
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,672
The only one
of the seven proved.

841
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,432
This...

842
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,515
This is your mother's problem.

843
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,829
Na... vi...

844
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,719
Navier-Stokes.

845
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,237
No picture.

846
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,231
- She didn't solve it?
- No.

847
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,719
She was close.

848
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,997
She would have won
the Fields Medal...

849
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,557
and probably shared a Nobel...

850
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,075
considering what it would have
meant for physics.

851
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,118
Maybe I'll have my picture
up here someday.

852
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,992
If you really desire it...

853
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,879
you can have
your picture there, darling.

854
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,315
I can help you.

855
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,234
It takes focus and hard work,
but if you succeed...

856
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:04,118
your name will live forever.

857
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,516
Don't be smug, Seymore.

858
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,990
Well, she's had plenty
of time.

859
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,675
She traveled yesterday.
She slept in a strange bed.

860
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,350
Give her a chance.

861
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:30,189
At six years old,
she read Zimmer.

862
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,589
Outstanding.

863
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,670
How much did she comprehend?

864
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,874
So, Mary...

865
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,718
I see you're looking
at our little problem.

866
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,235
Little? It's big.

867
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Yeah.

868
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,958
Why are you so mad
all of a sudden?

869
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,276
I'm not mad. I'm annoyed.

870
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,475
Not with you, dear.

871
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,835
With that pompous ass,
Shankland.

872
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,758
I knew that guy was gonna
have a beard

873
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,478
before we even went in there.

874
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,631
Math teachers
like to grow beards.

875
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,155
I should never have agreed
to this in the first place.

876
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,673
Did he really expect you

877
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,216
to just walk in
and be able to dissect...

878
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,276
some random, massive problem?

879
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:17,477
Not much to dissect,
if you ask me.

880
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,033
Why do you say that?

881
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,120
It was wrong.

882
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,189
What?

883
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,510
Well, for starters,

884
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,750
he forgot the negative sign
on the exponent.

885
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,990
It went downhill from there.

886
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,718
The problem was unsolvable.

887
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,196
Maybe this school isn't
as great as you think it is.

888
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,918
Mary, you knew
the problem was incorrect.

889
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,149
Why didn't you say anything?

890
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:54,193
Frank says I'm not supposed to
correct older people.

891
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,953
Nobody likes a smart-ass.

892
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,030
I'm loaded with swag!

893
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,548
Wanna come inside?

894
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,520
Cat.

895
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,670
Frank,
I think this is stupid.

896
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,876
Why don't we just call Evelyn

897
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,320
and tell her
I don't wanna do this?

898
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,588
Because like I told you,

899
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,240
Evelyn didn't order this.
The court did.

900
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,793
So again,
what are we gonna do?

901
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:32,955
Tell the truth.

902
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,040
Exactly.

903
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,456
Sooner we answer
these questions,

904
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,549
sooner we get to go home.

905
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:37,914
So, no attitude, okay?

906
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,672
Okay.

907
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,312
Frank?

908
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,515
Mary.

909
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,398
I like Evelyn.

910
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,152
She looks like my mom.

911
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,799
And she has a piano.

912
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,629
But I don't wanna live
with her.

913
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:58,989
She's bossy.

914
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,356
I've heard that.

915
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,039
Hey.

916
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,719
Don't worry.
You're not going anywhere.

917
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:10,840
Promise?

918
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,279
I promise.

919
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,516
Hi, Mary. I'm Pat Golding,

920
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,000
but you can call me Pat
if you like.

921
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,718
Got it.

922
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,632
Do you know why you're here?

923
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,109
I mean has anyone told you
what this is about?

924
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,840
My grandmother wants me
to live with her

925
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,154
and I wanna stay with Frank.

926
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,231
That's correct.

927
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,595
I'm sure this can all be
very scary stuff.

928
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,511
Does any of it worry you?

929
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:37,638
Nope. Frank says
I'm not goin' anywhere.

930
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,360
Your uncle told you
you're not going anywhere?

931
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,232
Just 15 minutes ago.

932
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,355
So, we done here?

933
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,359
Not quite yet.

934
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,269
My best friend other than
Frank and Fred is Roberta...

935
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,793
who lives
a couple houses away.

936
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,075
Really? What's she like?

937
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:55,391
She's nice and funny.
And I love her.

938
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,948
That's nice.

939
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:00,156
Is Roberta your only friend
your age?

940
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,916
Roberta's not my age.
She's like 40, 50...

941
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,718
30-something.

942
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,677
Roberta's a grown woman?

943
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:10,035
People my age are boring.

944
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,872
Roberta's cool.

945
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:13,875
Okay.

946
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,195
I don't watch TV.

947
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,510
But I got hooked on SpongeBob.

948
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,636
Mostly because
Roberta loves it.

949
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:24,597
Oh. And on Saturday nights,
we watch the UFC.

950
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,756
The UFC? Is that...

951
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,069
Is that Ultimate Fighting?

952
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,196
Every Saturday.

953
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,635
You and your uncle watch
Ultimate Fighting?

954
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,075
Well, you don't just watch it.

955
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,839
Frank turns the sound down

956
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,638
and we do the grunting
and voices.

957
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,515
Hmm.

958
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,511
Sometimes I attack Frank
for real.

959
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,671
Which is really fun for me.

960
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:46,796
I think if you guys
knew Frank,

961
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,359
you'd leave us alone.

962
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,911
He can be pretty annoying...

963
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,759
but he's a good person.

964
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,069
I think.

965
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,599
Why do you say that?

966
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,429
He wanted me
before I was smart.

967
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:03,233
Mr. Pollard, are you...

968
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:06,119
the natural father
of Mary Adler?

969
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,759
Yes, I am.

970
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,478
And how can you be
certain of this?

971
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:13,077
Well, I always knew,
but then you had me...

972
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:14,719
take a DNA test.

973
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,472
I would offer the test results

974
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,676
as presumptive evidence
that Mr. Pollard...

975
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,877
is the father and natural
guardian of the minor.

976
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,519
As well as an affidavit...

977
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,511
from Mr. Pollard nominating...

978
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,671
Mrs. Adler,
the maternal grandmother,

979
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,591
as the legal guardian
of the minor.

980
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,435
No objections.

981
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,272
Mr. Pollard...

982
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,910
has Mrs. Adler offered you
any monetary reward...

983
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,548
or employment
for coming forward today?

984
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,555
No, sir.
I have a job of my own.

985
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:45,760
Thank you.

986
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,512
No further questions,
Your Honor.

987
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:48,835
Mr. Pollard...

988
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,355
when was the last time
you saw Mary?

989
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,108
Uh... I've never seen her.

990
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,474
Oh, why not?

991
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,431
By the time
I heard about Diane...

992
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,072
passing...

993
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,037
the baby was gone already.

994
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,395
Well, did you try
and find her?

995
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,072
Best I could.

996
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,189
I couldn't just go
and search the entire country.

997
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:13,396
Do you use
a computer at work?

998
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:14,480
Sure.

999
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,391
You know what? Help me out.

1000
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,916
Here, let's google
"Mary Adler"

1001
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,355
and, uh, see what we find.

1002
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,119
You know what?

1003
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:35,872
Uh, you better add
her middle name.

1004
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,152
It'll narrow it down.

1005
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,074
Eileen.

1006
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,956
Yeah. Hit Enter.

1007
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:55,680
Page 2.

1008
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,235
Second hit.

1009
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,594
Would you please tell
the court what you see there?

1010
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,751
It's a newspaper article
called

1011
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,029
"Not So Terrible Twos."

1012
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:07,749
And one of them
is Mary Eileen Adler.

1013
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,592
Same name as your daughter.

1014
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,439
Born on the same day
as your daughter.

1015
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,591
With a photograph.

1016
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,416
Um, in your defense,
you'd never recognize it...

1017
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,136
- Your Honor, this is...
- Your Honor...

1018
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,310
if there's one thing here
that's sadly obvious...

1019
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:23,193
it's that Mr. Pollard
has never been

1020
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,918
a genuine guardian
of the minor...

1021
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,957
and his nomination
of Mrs. Adler

1022
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,598
is no less disingenuous.

1023
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,560
While the State of Florida
gives deference

1024
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,000
to nomination
by a natural parent...

1025
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,936
I'm inclined to side
with Mr. Cullen's laptop...

1026
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,188
at this time.

1027
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,475
Thank you, Your Honor.

1028
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,029
Don't gloat.

1029
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,872
Wouldn't dream of it.

1030
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,075
Walk you to your car?

1031
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,959
We've been so preoccupied,
I'm almost ashamed to ask.

1032
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,997
How's Walter?

1033
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,111
You wouldn't believe it
if I told you.

1034
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,200
Why?

1035
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,989
Well, your stepfather
is in Montana.

1036
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,957
He bought a ranch.

1037
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,040
Bullshit.

1038
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,918
Exactly. A man whose idea
of roughing it...

1039
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,953
is being too far from the ice
machine at the Ritz-Carlton...

1040
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,311
now owns a 1,000 acres
of grass and dung.

1041
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:26,074
Walter Price is a cowboy.

1042
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,276
Walter Price puts on
a Brooks Brothers suit

1043
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:29,554
to take out the garbage.

1044
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:32,917
He has a cowboy hat
and cowboy boots...

1045
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:35,355
and a horse
that doesn't know dressage.

1046
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,272
Is there some
logical reason for this?

1047
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,034
Midlife crisis, apparently.

1048
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:41,640
He's 70.

1049
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:42,949
I know.

1050
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,148
Must have been on time delay
or something.

1051
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,029
I guess I should be happy

1052
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:50,509
it wasn't a 25-year-old
cocktail waitress.

1053
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:52,668
But then again,

1054
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,990
an affair you can explain
to friends in a minute.

1055
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,590
For this, you put on
a pot of coffee.

1056
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,633
And he's out there right now?

1057
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,835
Yessiree!

1058
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:06,196
Ridin' the range.
Punchin' doggies.

1059
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,590
He had a six gun on his hip...

1060
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,672
and a saddlebag
full of Lipitor.

1061
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:16,191
The fastest asset management
in the West.

1062
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,794
The man who shot
Liberty Mutual.

1063
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:21,871
That's what I've been
calling him.

1064
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,558
That's really, really funny.

1065
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,996
Take her to the airport.

1066
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,598
Go home, Evelyn.

1067
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:45,069
Or Montana.
Rustle some cattle.

1068
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,200
You know...

1069
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,317
I have no desire to hurt you.

1070
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,436
I hate it that we're at odds.

1071
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,913
We're always at odds.

1072
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,235
Yes.

1073
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,479
Hotel.

1074
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,231
Mary, baby,
come on now.

1075
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,320
Stop this now.

1076
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,795
No.

1077
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:13,394
- Come on out, honey.
- No.

1078
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:15,376
Why did you have to tell her
that deadbeat was testifying?

1079
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,469
Because it's the truth.

1080
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:17,840
And if I didn't,
Evelyn would've.

1081
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,951
If I was the dad
of a little girl

1082
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,553
and I never saw her...

1083
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,950
and I was in the same town...

1084
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,439
I would visit her.

1085
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,079
Well, I hope you're happy.

1086
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:35,798
He didn't even
need directions.

1087
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,713
He could've followed you here.

1088
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,550
Speaking of men
who aren't worth a damn.

1089
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:51,237
Doesn't even wanna see
what I look like.

1090
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:56,469
All right.

1091
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:58,437
Hey, put your shoes on.
We're going for a ride.

1092
00:59:58,560 --> 00:59:59,560
You too.

1093
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,633
A ride?

1094
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,675
What are we doing here?

1095
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,512
Waiting.

1096
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:07,749
We can see that.

1097
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,200
Why?

1098
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,552
Because I said so.

1099
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:16,712
How long do we have to
stay here?

1100
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,672
As long as it takes.

1101
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,952
And keep your voice down.
It's a hospital.

1102
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,235
- Food's here.
- Yeah, food's here.

1103
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,351
It's a boy.

1104
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:55,360
Way to go!

1105
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:07,157
That's exactly how it was
when you were born.

1106
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,073
This happy?

1107
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:11,759
This happy.

1108
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:22,154
Who came out
and told everybody?

1109
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,079
I did.

1110
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,036
Can we stay for another?

1111
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:30,280
Mrs. Adler, in your earlier
testimony, here today...

1112
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,590
you've painted a pretty dim
picture of your own son.

1113
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:33,795
Don't you think?

1114
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:35,518
I'm under oath.

1115
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,432
I take no pleasure in it.

1116
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:39,838
So, your son's
a failure in life,

1117
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,080
your daughter took her life.

1118
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:42,240
You know, you're oh for two.

1119
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,833
- Objection!
- Withdrawn.

1120
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,639
If I go one for three,
I'm in the Hall of Fame.

1121
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:49,751
You know baseball.

1122
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:50,920
Fenway Park.

1123
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,600
You know, I'd like to go there
some time.

1124
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,116
How often in a year

1125
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,838
did you take Diane
to a baseball game?

1126
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,638
Diane wasn't interested
in sports.

1127
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,916
She never wanted to go
to a game? Ever?

1128
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:03,640
I don't recall her
ever asking.

1129
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,880
Just out of curiosity, Fenway,
that's a tough ticket.

1130
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:07,075
Where do you get yours?

1131
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,616
My husband has
season tickets.

1132
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:09,868
And how long has he had them?

1133
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:11,475
30 years.

1134
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,676
But I've only been
married to him for 20.

1135
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:15,910
And Diane never went
to one game?

1136
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,875
What color was the dress
Diane wore to prom?

1137
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:21,638
Diane didn't attend a prom

1138
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:22,776
because she didn't go
to a high school.

1139
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:23,800
No prom.

1140
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:24,989
What sports did she play?

1141
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:26,309
As I told you earlier,

1142
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,072
she wasn't interested
in sports.

1143
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,376
Did she go to camp
during the summer?

1144
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:30,435
No.

1145
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:32,670
- Community swimming pool?
- We had our own pool.

1146
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:34,119
- Girl Scouts?
- No.

1147
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:37,829
Then what did she do
with all that time?

1148
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,468
She loved mathematics.
It was her passion.

1149
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:43,074
She preferred it
to all other things.

1150
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:44,468
All other?

1151
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:49,591
Mrs. Adler, who's Paul Riva?

1152
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,919
He was a boy
from the neighborhood.

1153
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:59,475
Oh, come on.
He was much more than...

1154
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:01,278
just a boy
from the neighborhood.

1155
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,998
Paul was Diane's first love...

1156
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:04,195
wasn't he?

1157
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:06,350
I wouldn't characterize it
that way. No.

1158
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:08,351
And how would Diane
characterize it?

1159
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:10,556
Diane was 17 years old
at the time.

1160
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,478
She didn't know anything
about love.

1161
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:14,309
Mrs. Adler...

1162
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,391
in January of 1998...

1163
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:19,558
didn't Diane and young
Mr. Riva run away together?

1164
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:20,720
He coerced her.

1165
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,313
- And where did they go?
- Vermont.

1166
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,880
And you called the police,
didn't you?

1167
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,416
- Because he kidnapped her?
- Yes. Yes.

1168
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,908
And where did the police
find young Mr. Riva and Diane?

1169
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:29,433
I told you. Vermont.

1170
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,352
Stowe, Vermont. Wasn't it?

1171
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:32,520
A resort town.

1172
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:34,670
Stowe Mountain.

1173
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,910
He took her skiing.

1174
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,816
You see,
kidnappers don't usually

1175
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:40,239
take their victims skiing.

1176
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:44,234
But this is what Paul did...

1177
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,073
because he and Diane
were in love.

1178
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:48,160
No.

1179
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:49,468
And when they returned,

1180
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:51,471
you pressed
kidnapping charges.

1181
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:54,791
You filed a lawsuit
against his parents...

1182
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,996
until Paul stopped
calling Diane.

1183
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:58,479
- Didn't you?
- Yes.

1184
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:02,275
And Diane never heard from
or saw Paul Riva again.

1185
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:03,360
Did she?

1186
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:05,198
Not to my knowledge.

1187
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:09,078
And how did she take it?

1188
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,355
She was upset for a while.

1189
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:13,669
She lost focus.

1190
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,591
She lost focus.

1191
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:19,320
Mrs. Adler,
in March of 1999...

1192
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:22,119
didn't Diane Adler attempt
to take her own life?

1193
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:24,236
This episode was minor.
It was nothing.

1194
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,789
I have the hospital report
in my hand.

1195
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,319
It was nothing.

1196
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:30,675
Diane was not like
regular people.

1197
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,074
She was extraordinary.

1198
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,559
And extraordinary people

1199
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:36,234
come with singular issues
and needs.

1200
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,517
You have no idea
the capability she possessed.

1201
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,393
One in a billion.

1202
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:44,353
And you would say, "Fine,
let's throw that away...

1203
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:48,599
"so the boy who cuts our yard
can make a sexual conquest."

1204
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:50,478
Maybe before you make
that decision,

1205
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:52,073
you stand in my shoes.

1206
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:54,674
I had responsibilities
which went beyond

1207
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,159
the mother-daughter
relationship.

1208
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:58,351
The greatest discoveries

1209
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,271
which have improved life
on this planet...

1210
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:03,671
have come from minds
rarer than radium.

1211
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:06,479
Without them,
we'd still be crawling in mud.

1212
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,200
And for your information,
counselor...

1213
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:12,158
a year after this incident
with this boy...

1214
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:14,550
Diane thanked me
for my intervention.

1215
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:17,474
She realized she'd made
a mistake and she thanked me.

1216
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:19,471
You see, Diane understood
she was accountable

1217
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:20,760
for the gift she'd been given.

1218
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:22,114
And she didn't shy from it.

1219
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:25,192
And I think, if she were
here today, Mr. Attorney...

1220
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:27,828
she would refute
your baseless insinuations...

1221
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,680
that she would give up
her brilliant future

1222
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:30,829
and take her own life...

1223
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,595
just because Mommy didn't
get her a little red wagon.

1224
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:38,638
No more questions.

1225
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:15,829
Mr. Adler...

1226
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,717
where are you
currently employed?

1227
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:19,880
I repair boats.

1228
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:21,757
Oh, really? At which marina?

1229
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,797
I don't work at a marina.
I freelance.

1230
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:25,951
So, safe to say,
no health insurance.

1231
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:27,160
No.

1232
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,376
About a week before
your sister took her life...

1233
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:30,992
what were you doing
for a living then?

1234
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:32,749
I was a teacher.

1235
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,576
You're being
modest, aren't you?

1236
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,556
You were a professor
at Boston University...

1237
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:37,789
isn't that right?

1238
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:39,836
Yes, well,
Assistant Professor.

1239
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,399
And what'd you teach?

1240
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:42,480
Philosophy.

1241
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,471
Truth and logic.
That sort of thing.

1242
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:47,670
Your attorney said
that the primary reason...

1243
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:50,308
that you took Mary is because
it was what your sister...

1244
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:52,829
would have wanted you to do.
Is that the truth?

1245
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Yes.

1246
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:56,200
So Diane had visited
Pinellas County before?

1247
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:57,960
No.

1248
01:08:58,040 --> 01:08:59,176
Indicated she wanted
her daughter

1249
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,349
uprooted and moved here?

1250
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:02,192
- No.
- No.

1251
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:04,669
So, you decided to bring
Mary here, didn't you?

1252
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:07,388
Did Diane have a problem

1253
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:09,160
with your health plan
at Boston University?

1254
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:10,235
Not to my knowledge.

1255
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:11,416
Do you think she would want
her daughter

1256
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:12,576
to have access to healthcare?

1257
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:13,476
Of course.

1258
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:16,233
So what do you do,
when little Mary gets sick?

1259
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:17,833
You repair a doctor's boat?

1260
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,797
- Objection.
- Sustained.

1261
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:21,829
Mary has been identified...

1262
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,195
as a math prodigy.

1263
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:26,555
But her formal math education
under your care...

1264
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:28,910
she's learning at the
first grade level, isn't she?

1265
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,035
Yes.

1266
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:32,634
And you turned down
a scholarship at the Oaks...

1267
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:36,030
a school specializing in the
education of gifted children?

1268
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:37,120
Yes.

1269
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,236
And Diane,
she'd be fine with that?

1270
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:42,229
I couldn't say.

1271
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,176
Prior to Mrs. Adler
giving her one,

1272
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:45,269
did Mary have a computer?

1273
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:46,395
She used mine.

1274
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:48,630
Mr. Adler, does Diane's
daughter have her own bedroom?

1275
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:49,755
No.

1276
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,536
Does she sleep
in a bed that you bought...

1277
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:52,993
- in a secondhand shop?
- Yes.

1278
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:55,674
So, the truth is, Mr. Adler,

1279
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,319
that you didn't come down here

1280
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:58,958
because your sister
wanted you to...

1281
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:00,256
and you certainly
didn't come here

1282
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:01,440
because it was good for Mary.

1283
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,277
No, it was personal.

1284
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,112
Diane was a star.
You weren't.

1285
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,952
Diane got the attention.
You didn't.

1286
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,519
And over the years,
you got angry.

1287
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:09,709
And here comes Mary.

1288
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:11,836
What a great way to get even.

1289
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,592
You've uprooted
that little girl

1290
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:15,352
and brought her here
for one reason only.

1291
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:17,391
To do harm to your mother.

1292
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:18,680
You blamed her
for your sister.

1293
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:19,829
No, I don't.

1294
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,576
And Mary to you is just a pawn
in all this. Isn't she?

1295
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,636
Diane wanted Mary...

1296
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,119
to be a kid.

1297
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,596
She wanted her to have a life.

1298
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:31,878
She wanted her
to have friends...

1299
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:34,272
and to play...

1300
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:36,595
and to be happy.

1301
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:38,910
Do you realize
the consequences

1302
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,991
of boredom for a gifted child,
Mr. Adler?

1303
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:43,276
They become resentful
and sullen.

1304
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,475
Mary's not an angry kid.

1305
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:45,629
Really?

1306
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,716
Did she not attack a child
on the school bus?

1307
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:49,560
A 12-year-old tripped

1308
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,016
a 7-year-old
and she came to his defense.

1309
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,951
- Did she break the boy's nose?
- Yes.

1310
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:57,113
On October 16th of last year
were you arrested for assault?

1311
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:58,508
Oh, my God.

1312
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,840
You have to answer
the question, Mr. Adler.

1313
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:06,110
A drunk idiot attacked me
and I defended myself.

1314
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:07,376
What does that have to do
with anything?

1315
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:08,640
Did you spend the night
in jail?

1316
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:10,509
Yeah.

1317
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,636
You are in way
over your head here.

1318
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,233
You're depriving that girl.

1319
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:15,696
You're gambling
with her future...

1320
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:17,776
and now you're being presented
with an opportunity...

1321
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:18,976
to do right by her.
Jump at it.

1322
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,336
Does counsel
have a question for my client?

1323
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:21,759
Take the high road,
Mr. Adler...

1324
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:23,016
before she is
irreparably damaged.

1325
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,136
Does counsel
have a question...

1326
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:25,176
- for my client or not?
- Yes, sir.

1327
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,838
I do have the question.

1328
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,988
Tell us, is your
continued guardianship...

1329
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:34,311
really in the best interest
of this little girl?

1330
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:42,355
Yes.

1331
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,040
Yes, it is.

1332
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,551
I have
no further questions.

1333
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:55,416
Research
and Development...

1334
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,032
has come up
with a brand new Fred cheer.

1335
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:00,158
Fred personally asked me
if I would tell you it.

1336
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,197
Let's hear it.

1337
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:05,557
S-O-C-K I-T
Sock it to me, Freddy...

1338
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:08,029
Sock it.

1339
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:11,869
Sock it.

1340
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,158
Tell R and D,
they got a winner.

1341
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:19,470
That's exactly what I said.

1342
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:24,116
S-O-C-K I-T
Sock it to me, Freddy

1343
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,636
They wanna cut a deal.

1344
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,791
Highsmith called me
first thing this morning.

1345
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,560
Why would he do that?
I don't understand.

1346
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:35,953
In the middle of...

1347
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:38,549
Just listen.
Listen to me, man.

1348
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:44,596
Mary would be put
in a fostering situation.

1349
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:45,875
No.

1350
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:47,256
- Come on, Frank.
- Cullen, I told you no.

1351
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,633
It wouldn't be
a court-appointed

1352
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:50,034
foster family, Frank.

1353
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,616
- Hey! Drop it!
- We could cherry-pick...

1354
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:52,755
from the cream of the crop.

1355
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:54,478
Mutually approved.

1356
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,638
Just hear me out.

1357
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:57,755
Tampa.

1358
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,876
I insisted, and they agreed.

1359
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:02,634
No more than a half an hour
from your front door.

1360
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,711
Now, she would attend
the Oaks.

1361
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,518
It's a great school.

1362
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:08,320
And visiting rights
for the grandmother...

1363
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:09,873
but she was gonna
get that anyway.

1364
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:12,031
Right? And on her
12th birthday, Frank,

1365
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:13,394
she can go back into court...

1366
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:14,629
- No.
- and decide then...

1367
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:15,896
where she wants to live
and with who.

1368
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:16,796
I don't understand this.

1369
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,216
I thought you were supposed
to be on my team.

1370
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:19,416
Why are you bringing me
this deal?

1371
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:21,431
Other than
I'm required to by law?

1372
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:22,999
You like this deal?

1373
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:26,153
I love this deal.

1374
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,592
They think they're gonna lose.

1375
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:47,593
Yeah.

1376
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:48,875
They do.

1377
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:51,799
You think we're gonna lose.

1378
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,149
Yes.

1379
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:55,032
I do, Frank.

1380
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:05,320
I gotta go put my kids to bed.

1381
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:09,190
I'll do whatever
you want me to do.

1382
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,390
But if we leave this
up to that judge, Nichols...

1383
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:15,551
he's old school, Frank.

1384
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,830
Does he like your mother? No.

1385
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,319
Does he like her income?

1386
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:22,517
Does he like her health plan?
Does he like her home?

1387
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:24,636
You better believe it.

1388
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,518
I've been in his courtroom.

1389
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,238
A hundred times.

1390
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,197
And if it's a coin toss...

1391
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:32,515
Look at me.

1392
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:38,233
If it's a coin toss...

1393
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:42,313
that old boy is going to
side with the money.

1394
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:45,151
So, do me a favor, Frank.

1395
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:48,039
Just meet the family.
See how it feels.

1396
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:49,553
It's all I ask.

1397
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:09,949
Fly away, little pretty bird

1398
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:16,550
Fly, fly away...

1399
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,034
Pool. Florida.

1400
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,348
That dock
is on the Intercoastal.

1401
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,272
Which I guess is obvious...

1402
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,431
since we're on
the Intercoastal.

1403
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:32,270
Added this desk,
so she could do her homework.

1404
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:33,953
Yeah.

1405
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:36,435
And this would be her room.

1406
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:44,388
I see in your eyes a promise

1407
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:48,112
So, while I'm trying to
sell you on the house...

1408
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:49,952
and us...

1409
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,678
I just don't want you to think

1410
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,478
that we're
completely insensitive...

1411
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:55,312
to what you're feeling.

1412
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:08,548
You guys gonna be okay
with a cat?

1413
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:12,192
Absolutely.

1414
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:18,951
Love's own tender flames

1415
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:21,470
Warm this meeting

1416
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:28,996
And love's tender song
you will sing

1417
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:34,271
But fly away...

1418
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:37,676
I've been thinking a lot
about the word "compromise."

1419
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:41,310
On one hand,
good challenging school...

1420
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:42,799
on the other...

1421
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:44,633
foster people.

1422
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,392
They can watch sitcoms
with her.

1423
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,471
Take her to Olive Garden.

1424
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:51,279
Teach her
to say "irregardless."

1425
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,158
The only saving grace,
I suppose,

1426
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:55,276
is she's better off
than she was.

1427
01:16:58,160 --> 01:16:59,354
Well...

1428
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:03,392
Goodbye, Frank.

1429
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:18,392
Hey...

1430
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:20,118
come on.

1431
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:21,958
I'm only 25 minutes away.

1432
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:24,156
Please don't leave me here.

1433
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,719
- Please.
- No.

1434
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:28,315
Look, you're going to

1435
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,800
a brand new school,
a better school.

1436
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:31,712
I don't want to.

1437
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:33,029
I want my crummy school.

1438
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:34,428
- And you got Fred.
- Please.

1439
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:35,936
And once a month
you can come back.

1440
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:37,096
You can stay with me
and Roberta.

1441
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:39,156
I want you and Roberta now!

1442
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:41,072
And in a few years,
if you want...

1443
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:42,832
you can come back.
You can live with me.

1444
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:44,673
I wanna stay with you.

1445
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:46,319
Frank, you promised me.

1446
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:48,471
- Come on. Don't do this.
- You promised me.

1447
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:49,795
I know.

1448
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:51,629
I know.

1449
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:54,879
Please, Frank.
Why are you leaving me?

1450
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,998
Because the court said
I had to. You know this.

1451
01:17:58,160 --> 01:17:59,991
We've discussed this
ad naus...

1452
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:05,078
We've discussed this. Come on.

1453
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:08,558
- Come on, please.
- No!

1454
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:09,755
- Hey, Mary.
- No!

1455
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:10,909
Hey, Mary.

1456
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:12,155
No! No!

1457
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:13,435
Sweetheart, you know what?

1458
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:14,669
No!

1459
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:16,279
There's no easy way
to do this.

1460
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:18,237
Not gonna be as long
as you think, honey.

1461
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,549
- Frank!
- You're gonna see.

1462
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:20,994
Frank!

1463
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,191
Don't leave me!

1464
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,430
- I know this is hard.
- Please!

1465
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,989
No! Get your hands off of me!

1466
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:30,116
- Frank! Please!
- I know it's hard.

1467
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:32,077
- Come back!
- Mary! I know.

1468
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:33,434
No!

1469
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:35,312
Frank!

1470
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:37,392
Don't go!

1471
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,398
I need you!

1472
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:42,869
Fred needs you!

1473
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:44,428
You promised me!

1474
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:52,235
No!

1475
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:08,278
Huh.

1476
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,439
Hey, down there.

1477
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:37,760
I don't know
which mistake is worse.

1478
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:39,358
Designing a water pump
that leaks...

1479
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:42,318
or putting it somewhere
no human being can reach.

1480
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:48,874
How do you design something
you know is gonna fail?

1481
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:53,272
Gotta be devious
or clueless, right?

1482
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,312
After the first few weeks,
I knew...

1483
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:02,511
I had to find
a real family for her.

1484
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:08,114
I was in way over my head.

1485
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:14,996
And every day, I'd say,
"Today's the day...

1486
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:17,031
"I'm takin' her
to child services."

1487
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:19,953
And every day,
she'd do something just...

1488
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,988
so unbelievably cool.

1489
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:30,153
Her little personality
was exploding.

1490
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:33,752
She was funny.

1491
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:37,439
And she was angry, and
she was happy, and she was...

1492
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:40,033
sad.

1493
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:42,429
And was cute.

1494
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:46,430
Just so damn entertaining.

1495
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:48,431
And so I kept her.

1496
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,113
Not that
that's in her best interest.

1497
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,914
Not that I'm capable
of raising a child.

1498
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:54,680
A child that might still
have a mother...

1499
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:57,188
if I had taken the time to
notice that she needed me.

1500
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:02,597
And now,
six and a half years later...

1501
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:04,637
I finally got her
to the foster family,

1502
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:06,039
and you know what?

1503
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:08,270
It was great. She loved it.

1504
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:10,956
I thought
it would be a nightmare...

1505
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,599
of abandonment and betrayal.

1506
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:14,870
But, turns out
it was a huge success.

1507
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:17,229
I'm a fucking hero.

1508
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:25,192
- Frank...
- No, Bonnie.

1509
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:27,792
I appreciate
everything you've done.

1510
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:29,188
Just...

1511
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,072
- Hey.
- Hi, Frank.

1512
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,356
We're having a little bit
of a problem in there.

1513
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:55,720
What?

1514
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:57,836
Uh, Mary's fine...

1515
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,877
but she's having
a little bit of a meltdown.

1516
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:02,910
Right. Let me talk to her.

1517
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:04,479
No, hang on.

1518
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:07,634
That's not a good idea.

1519
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,117
Your visit here is the reason
for the meltdown.

1520
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:12,515
What?

1521
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:15,871
She don't wanna see you.

1522
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:22,633
I'm sorry, man.

1523
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:25,038
This is predictable.

1524
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:27,714
You know, she needs time.

1525
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:34,798
Just give me five minutes
with her.

1526
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:36,679
I let you inside...

1527
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:38,558
then we're gonna
betray her trust

1528
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:40,159
and we have
an even bigger problem.

1529
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:57,799
Oh...

1530
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:07,119
- Hi.
- Hi! Can we help you?

1531
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:09,754
Yeah. Do you have a one-eyed
orange cat named Fred?

1532
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:13,159
We have a one-eyed cat,

1533
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:14,560
but I don't know
what his name is.

1534
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:15,999
Where?

1535
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:18,549
I don't know.
Today was his last day.

1536
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:22,638
Hey, you can't go back there.

1537
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:27,280
Hey.

1538
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:32,154
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing back here?

1539
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,516
I told him he couldn't.

1540
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:43,880
Hey, Fred.

1541
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:48,673
Who brought this cat in?

1542
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:51,195
Some guy. He said
it was an allergy issue.

1543
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:55,952
Evelyn.

1544
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:39,394
- Frank!
- Where's Evelyn?

1545
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:40,913
Evelyn? You mean your mother?

1546
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:42,638
- Yes.
- Kevin.

1547
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:44,159
Evelyn is in the guest house.

1548
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:46,390
Yeah, listen. I'm sorry, man.

1549
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:47,834
Frank, let me tell you,

1550
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,876
she was so helpful
with the tutors.

1551
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:51,268
- Mary was so distant.
- Hey!

1552
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:52,656
Look, we know
what you're up against.

1553
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:53,696
Do you want your life back?

1554
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:54,720
Go back inside.

1555
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:00,994
What are you doing here?

1556
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:04,833
Come on, Mary.
We're goin' home.

1557
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,514
- No.
- You're trespassing!

1558
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:10,793
You need to look at this.

1559
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:12,400
Let's go, Mary.

1560
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:13,589
- Let's move. Come on.
- No!

1561
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:14,749
- Hey! Mary.
- Mary!

1562
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:15,989
Mary!

1563
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:18,475
- It's okay. I got her.
- Uh-uh!

1564
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:22,510
Think again, lady.

1565
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:46,315
Mary!

1566
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:48,630
Mary! Hey, stop it.

1567
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,153
No! Let me go!

1568
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:51,389
No!

1569
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:53,232
- No! No!
- Stop, Mary!

1570
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:54,833
- Stop. Stop.
- No!

1571
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:56,473
- Come here.
- You lied to me!

1572
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:57,640
I know!

1573
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:00,274
- No! No!
- Stop! Stop, stop!

1574
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:01,794
I'm sorry.

1575
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,594
I made a mistake.
I'm so sorry.

1576
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:05,915
You promised me.

1577
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:07,149
I know.

1578
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:08,469
You promised.

1579
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:10,835
I know. I'm sorry.

1580
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:13,593
You said
you wouldn't leave me.

1581
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:15,393
I made a mistake.

1582
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:18,635
I'm sorry.

1583
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:23,796
I was so sad!

1584
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:26,149
I missed you.

1585
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:27,952
I missed you, too.

1586
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:30,878
They took Fred.

1587
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:33,554
No. It's okay.

1588
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:36,473
- I got him. He's home.
- What?

1589
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:39,154
He's at the apartment
right now. I got him.

1590
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:41,034
For real?

1591
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:44,755
Yeah. He's home kicking around
his ping pong ball.

1592
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:47,876
Why did you leave me there?

1593
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,670
Because I thought
I was bad for you.

1594
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,313
And then it dawned on me.

1595
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:56,914
If Mary is this amazing...

1596
01:28:57,080 --> 01:29:00,197
smart, sweet human being...

1597
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:02,430
then I must be
doing something right.

1598
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:13,155
You're smiling.

1599
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:26,638
Roberta!

1600
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:28,595
Oh, baby.

1601
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:30,591
Of all the stunts
you could pull.

1602
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:33,118
- Where are they going?
- Nowhere.

1603
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:34,349
Not yet.

1604
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:36,759
You two, out!

1605
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:44,576
- What is this?
- Do you want to know...

1606
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:45,696
how Diane told me
she finished?

1607
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:47,711
What is this
unconscionable lie?

1608
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:49,108
I walked into her apartment

1609
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:50,296
and she was sitting
on the floor...

1610
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:51,360
with that baby in her arms

1611
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:52,576
and you know
what she said to me?

1612
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:54,079
Admit it. You made this up.

1613
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:55,759
- She said, "What do I do now?"
- No.

1614
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:57,273
It is not a completed proof...

1615
01:29:57,440 --> 01:30:00,079
- It is.
- No! It isn't! It can't be.

1616
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:01,468
Evelyn, stop!

1617
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:04,519
I'm taking Mary
and I'm raising her

1618
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:06,113
how I believe Diane
would've wanted.

1619
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:07,496
- We'll see about that later.
- I realize...

1620
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:08,839
she's not normal.

1621
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:10,956
But if Einstein can
ride a bike, so can she.

1622
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:13,588
Let's just say Diane didn't
tell me, which is nonsense...

1623
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:14,994
it's a Millennium Problem.

1624
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:16,911
She would have shared it
with the world.

1625
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:18,832
That's where
your charade falls apart.

1626
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,956
If she had
completed the proof,

1627
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:22,439
she would have published it.

1628
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:27,755
Diane instructed me
very clearly.

1629
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:32,356
That I was only to publish it
postmortem.

1630
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:34,598
She died six years ago.

1631
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:39,471
It wasn't her death
she was talking about.

1632
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:02,155
I tried to talk her out of it.

1633
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:05,119
But you know
how Diane could be

1634
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:07,031
when she made her mind up
about something.

1635
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:10,438
I called MIT.

1636
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:11,600
Shankland's out of his mind

1637
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:13,671
about the possibility
of publishing it with you.

1638
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:16,513
He's waiting for your call.

1639
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:19,536
You're gonna be spending the
next few years of your life...

1640
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:20,993
defending it.

1641
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:22,953
You won't have time for her.

1642
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:30,952
What if I say no?

1643
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:39,232
Back to Plan A.

1644
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:45,595
Wait for me to die?

1645
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:53,317
I know Diane was hard.

1646
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:57,913
I know she was angry.

1647
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:02,034
But something really good
came out of this, Evelyn.

1648
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:07,552
She needs you now.

1649
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:10,510
You're the best woman
for the job.

1650
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:12,519
Take it.

1651
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:21,315
It doesn't seem as though
Diane wanted me to have it.

1652
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:27,676
Diane didn't always
think things through.

1653
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,834
I'll be outside.

1654
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,319
Let me know what you wanna do.

1655
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:57,896
You've reached

1656
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:00,354
the Department
of Mathematics at MIT.

1657
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:01,919
If you know
your party's extension,

1658
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,070
you may dial it at any time.

1659
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:06,872
If you wish to speak
to an operator...

1660
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:08,029
please stay on the line

1661
01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:10,435
and someone will be with you
as soon as possible.

1662
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:20,069
Good
afternoon, MIT Mathematics,

1663
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:21,309
how may I direct your call?

1664
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:25,069
Hello? I'm sorry.
I can't hear you very well.

1665
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:27,071
No! No.

1666
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,796
Yeah. There you are.

1667
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:31,234
Yeah, can I help you?

1668
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:32,594
Uh, yes.

1669
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:37,032
Doctor Shankland.

1670
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:39,710
I'm really sorry.
I can't hear you.

1671
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:41,711
Could you speak up, please?

1672
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:45,795
Hello?

1673
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:52,035
Evelyn Adler...

1674
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:54,111
for Seymore Shankland, please.

1675
01:34:56,160 --> 01:34:57,416
And what I want you to notice,

1676
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:58,873
is that when you
compute P of N...

1677
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:00,951
for N congruent
to four mod five...

1678
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:03,839
the answer
is a multiple of five.

1679
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,877
So, the first person
to notice this

1680
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:07,075
was Srinivasa Ramanujan.

1681
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:08,798
In the beginning
of the 20th century...

1682
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:11,315
he proved that
it was the case for all...

1683
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:13,357
numbers congruent
to four mod five.

1684
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:16,518
So, he proved
that P of five N plus four...

1685
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:18,830
is congruent
to zero mod seven...

1686
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,594
and that P of eleven N
plus six

1687
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:23,511
is congruent
to zero mod eleven.

1688
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:28,635
Good?

1689
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:35,112
You drive
like an old lady.

1690
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:36,720
It's Florida.
I'm blending in.

1691
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:39,073
How was school?

1692
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:41,192
Hmm, fun.

1693
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:43,828
Not like regular school fun...

1694
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,672
but interesting.

1695
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:50,637
What is this book?

1696
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:53,758
Discourse on Method.
René Descartes.

1697
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:55,873
What's it about?

1698
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:57,553
Existence.

1699
01:35:57,640 --> 01:35:58,755
Existence?

1700
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:01,877
Yup. "I think,
therefore I am."

1701
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:03,998
Well, of course you are.

1702
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:05,559
That's obvious.

1703
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:12,439
I think about Fred,
therefore, I am.

1704
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,670
Cogito ergo Fred?

1705
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:18,355
He's a dude and he's a guy.

1706
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:21,512
And he only has one eye.

1707
01:36:23,160 --> 01:36:25,628
Fred, Fred, Fred!

1708
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:28,352
Freddy, Fred, Fred!

1709
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,513
All right, here we are.

1710
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:36,551
Hey! Wait till
I come to a stop.

1711
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:39,075
Then come
to a stop already!

1712
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:13,959
A new wind is
blowing through these streets

1713
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:19,150
Those cold days
are history to us

1714
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:25,072
I'm not sayin'
times they won't get tough

1715
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:31,032
We still got each other
That's enough

1716
01:37:34,160 --> 01:37:37,470
I know life
ain't simple for you, dear

1717
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:43,111
But I'm here,
and I'm not going anywhere

1718
01:37:46,120 --> 01:37:49,032
I'm not sayin'
I know how you feel

1719
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:55,276
I just know
that I can help you deal

1720
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,434
Don't lose your mind

1721
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:02,479
Don't lose your good heart

1722
01:38:02,920 --> 01:38:05,036
Just know this time

1723
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:11,114
That you'll be waking up
in all these better days

1724
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:14,996
This is how you walk on

1725
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:20,632
This is where you belong

1726
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:28,514
I'm not sayin'
this isn't where you 'll stay

1727
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:32,472
But this is how you walk on

1728
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:35,598
This is how you walk on

1729
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:46,675
The warm light of the evening
sings so sweet

1730
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:52,999
Cold grass
underneath your dancin' feet

1731
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:58,149
These simple things
mean more than I can say

1732
01:39:00,640 --> 01:39:04,872
These moments make up
for our past dark days

1733
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:08,349
Don't lose your mind

1734
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:11,030
Don't lose your good heart

1735
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,638
Just know this time

1736
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:20,114
That you'll be waking up
in all these better days

1737
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:23,756
This how you walk on

1738
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:29,597
This is where you belong

1739
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:37,919
I'm not sayin'
this isn't where you'll stay

1740
01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:41,398
But this is how you walk on

1741
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:44,392
This is how you walk on

1742
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:11,438
This is how you walk on

1743
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:17,916
This is where you belong

1744
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:25,434
I'm not saying
this isn't where you'll stay

1745
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:29,279
But this is how you walk on

1746
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:32,472
This is how you walk on

1747
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:35,832
This is how you walk on

1748
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:42,313
This is where you belong

1749
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:49,997
I'm not saying
this isn't where you'll stay

1750
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:53,632
But this is how you walk on

1751
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:57,031
This is how you walk on
