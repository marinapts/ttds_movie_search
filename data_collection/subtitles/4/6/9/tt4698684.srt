1
00:02:32,917 --> 00:02:35,166
Here I come!

2
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:36,957
Here I come.

3
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,079
Mrs Faulkner?

4
00:02:38,084 --> 00:02:40,134
Yes. Bella Faulkner.

5
00:02:41,542 --> 00:02:45,502
Bella, Paula Hall from Child Welfare
Services. This is Ricky Baker.

6
00:02:45,503 --> 00:02:47,916
Ricky Baker. Yes.

7
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:51,287
Oh, here you are.

8
00:02:51,501 --> 00:02:53,081
Mm.

9
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:59,128
Ricky, I'm Bella. Uh, you can call
me Bella, or Auntie, if you like,

10
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:01,076
even though I'm not
your real auntie.

11
00:03:01,084 --> 00:03:03,916
But, you know, it's
a bit less formal.

12
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,577
Whoo. You're a big fella!

13
00:03:05,584 --> 00:03:10,004
Who ate the guy who
ate all the pies, eh?

14
00:03:11,001 --> 00:03:12,001
Sorry.

15
00:03:12,751 --> 00:03:14,421
Well, he's nice.

16
00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:18,042
Yeah. Now, uh, obviously we've got a
couple of things to talk through, Bella.

17
00:03:18,084 --> 00:03:22,384
Clearly you've been briefed about his, uh,
background and also his foster care history.

18
00:03:22,417 --> 00:03:24,787
Apparently he's a bit of
a handful, a real bad egg.

19
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:27,464
I mean, if you look at his file,
you'll see that for yourself.

20
00:03:27,501 --> 00:03:31,791
We're talking disobedience, stealing,
spitting, running away,

21
00:03:31,792 --> 00:03:36,791
throwing rocks, kicking stuff, defacing
stuff, burning stuff, loitering and graffiti.

22
00:03:36,792 --> 00:03:38,922
And that's just the
stuff we know about.

23
00:03:39,042 --> 00:03:42,752
But hopefully, uh, change in scene
will help straighten him out.

24
00:03:43,334 --> 00:03:45,134
He's home now. He'll be OK.

25
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:48,417
OK. Well, I like your
enthusiasm. Good.

26
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:03,249
Ricky, this is your new home.

27
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:05,292
A real piece of work, this one.

28
00:04:05,417 --> 00:04:06,667
Ricky!

29
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:10,877
There's no one else
who wants you, OK?

30
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:15,247
Now, Ricky, you know what the
alternative is, don't you? Eh?

31
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:20,829
Think you can make it work? 'Course we can.
We'll make it work.

32
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:31,419
Move. Move it. Move!

33
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:34,922
Yeah. I've been in
this game a long time.

34
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,579
'No child left behind' is our motto.

35
00:04:36,626 --> 00:04:39,996
Well, it's not, you know, the official
motto, but it's definitely mine.

36
00:04:40,042 --> 00:04:43,632
Also, as part of the transition process,
I'll be needing to inspect your property,

37
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:46,416
just to make sure that it's
up to our high standard.

38
00:04:46,417 --> 00:04:48,827
Looks fine. What do you think,
Constable Tappert?

39
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:52,582
- Andy!
- Yeah, it looks cool.Yeah.

40
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:56,746
We'll be coming in every eight weeks or so,
just to check in on, uh...

41
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,247
Who's that Crocodile Dundee
guy over there?

42
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:05,711
Oh, that's my husband, Hector.

43
00:05:05,751 --> 00:05:08,751
Whoa. He's giving
that pig a piggyback.

44
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:17,129
Well, I see he has a rifle. Just
keep it away from this little guy.

45
00:05:17,542 --> 00:05:19,422
God knows what he's capable of.

46
00:05:19,876 --> 00:05:22,375
OK, he's all yours. No returns.

47
00:05:22,376 --> 00:05:24,036
Oh, I'm just joking.

48
00:05:24,042 --> 00:05:27,882
OK. You've got my number, so just, uh,
ring me if you've got any trouble. OK?

49
00:05:28,334 --> 00:05:29,384
Bye, Ricky.

50
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:32,754
Bye, Ricky.

51
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,579
Wow, what a shocker, eh

52
00:05:36,251 --> 00:05:38,081
OK, let's go, Andy.

53
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:48,079
Ricky, this is Hec. You can
call him Uncle, if you like.

54
00:05:49,751 --> 00:05:51,421
No, he can't.

55
00:05:54,376 --> 00:05:56,746
What do you want to do?
Are you hungry?

56
00:05:57,751 --> 00:06:01,171
That's a silly question,
isn't it? Look at you.

57
00:06:22,501 --> 00:06:24,831
Mm?

58
00:06:30,126 --> 00:06:35,496
You ever worked on a farm before
or you just... ornamental?

59
00:06:36,834 --> 00:06:40,543
Hec. Just remember when we first met,
you weren't much good to anyone.

60
00:06:40,544 --> 00:06:43,792
Just a scruffy white drifter who
smelled like methylated spirits.

61
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:45,709
Goodnight.

62
00:06:46,126 --> 00:06:48,076
Eh? What's that, dear?

63
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:51,376
Goodnight.

64
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:53,962
Oh...

65
00:06:55,501 --> 00:06:57,421
Jeez, Hec. You bloody idiot.

66
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:58,541
What?

67
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:02,792
Ricky?

68
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:05,829
Buddy? Are you OK?

69
00:07:06,334 --> 00:07:09,504
Sorry about Hec. He's a
silly old goat, that's all.

70
00:07:10,417 --> 00:07:13,667
OK, well, I hope you
like your room, petal.

71
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:16,918
They said you liked to read, so
I got a bunch of books for you,

72
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:21,417
and you'll also notice an Indian lamp,
a bulldog lamp and some cats,

73
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:24,329
and a nice sharp knife to
kill monsters in the night.

74
00:07:24,376 --> 00:07:27,727
I can't imagine what you've been through,
boy. You know, I can't imagine it was easy.

75
00:07:27,751 --> 00:07:29,711
But you're here now.
This is home.

76
00:07:30,626 --> 00:07:35,706
Anyway, it's really nice to have
you here, and I left a hottie in your bed.

77
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:37,751
We'll see you in the morning.

78
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:39,542
OK?

79
00:07:40,792 --> 00:07:42,082
OK, Ricky?

80
00:07:42,917 --> 00:07:43,917
OK.

81
00:07:44,917 --> 00:07:47,077
Nigh-night, then.
See you in the morning.

82
00:08:59,917 --> 00:09:05,917
Jeez, boy, it's a miracle we found you!
You made it all of 200m.

83
00:09:08,001 --> 00:09:09,791
I was just taking a break.

84
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:12,247
Hec's cooking breakfast.

85
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:19,077
Eggs, bacon, a few sossies
on the side,... pancakes.

86
00:09:21,751 --> 00:09:26,961
Come on. Have some breakfast,
then you can run away.

87
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,919
Oh man. I got poop on my kicks.

88
00:09:41,292 --> 00:09:43,542
Go away, insect!

89
00:09:49,042 --> 00:09:51,672
Good pancake.

90
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:56,002
So, what's your dog's name?

91
00:09:56,876 --> 00:09:57,956
Zag.

92
00:09:58,334 --> 00:10:00,794
You should get another
one and name it Zig.

93
00:10:03,542 --> 00:10:07,752
Bella told me to tell you that...
you should give me something to do.

94
00:10:07,753 --> 00:10:09,421
Is there anything
you want me to do?

95
00:10:09,584 --> 00:10:13,174
Yeah,... leave me alone.

96
00:10:16,292 --> 00:10:17,462
Cool.

97
00:11:01,126 --> 00:11:02,166
Morning.

98
00:11:02,167 --> 00:11:05,457
Morning. I thought
you were running away.

99
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:09,331
I did, but I forgot something,
so I came back.

100
00:11:09,376 --> 00:11:13,326
Oh. Good for you, Ricky.
Good to see some initiative.

101
00:11:16,167 --> 00:11:18,287
You ever been up in
that jungle before?

102
00:11:18,501 --> 00:11:22,961
Oh, it's not a jungle; it's the bush. There's
about a million hectares of it, buddy.

103
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:25,457
You said 'bush'.

104
00:11:26,126 --> 00:11:28,916
I'm from up there,
deep in the mountains.

105
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:30,629
You ever go back much? Not for

106
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:34,377
a long time. It's a
hard journey, easy to get lost.

107
00:11:34,626 --> 00:11:37,206
We got a lake up there
called Makutekahu.

108
00:11:37,542 --> 00:11:40,382
It's so high up it wets
the cloak of the sky.

109
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:43,879
It's the first place our spirits
go on their way to Reinga.

110
00:11:44,334 --> 00:11:48,004
Yeah, when my time comes,
that's where I'll go too.

111
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:52,500
Man, you guys got a lot
of dead stuff round here.

112
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:56,501
Mm. Saw a dead sheep the other day.
Had maggots in it.

113
00:11:57,251 --> 00:11:59,961
There's heaps of maggots,

114
00:12:00,334 --> 00:12:03,384
maggots wriggling in that sheep

115
00:12:03,751 --> 00:12:08,081
like moving rice. Yuck.

116
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:12,962
That was my haiku about maggots.

117
00:12:13,084 --> 00:12:15,044
It's called 'Maggots'.

118
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:20,417
This counsellor lady made me
do them when I got in trouble.

119
00:12:20,501 --> 00:12:23,041
They help me express
my feelings.

120
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:26,132
They're poems made up of...
Yeah. I know what a haiku is.

121
00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:30,379
I got heaps of them...
want to hear another one?

122
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:31,077
Sure.

123
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,211
OK.

124
00:12:34,042 --> 00:12:35,632
'Kingi, you wanker.

125
00:12:35,751 --> 00:12:38,711
'You arsehole.
I hate you heaps.

126
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:41,577
'Please die soon in pain.'

127
00:12:42,292 --> 00:12:44,882
That was called
'Kingi, you Wanker'.

128
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:47,917
Yeah, yeah. OK. Got ya. Got ya.
That's enough haikus for today.

129
00:12:48,542 --> 00:12:50,962
Come on. Sit down.
Come and give me a hand.

130
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:54,749
Well, it's like this,

131
00:12:55,917 --> 00:12:59,417
and then you put it in this bag.

132
00:12:59,542 --> 00:13:00,632
Easy.

133
00:13:01,334 --> 00:13:02,634
Here you go. You have a go.

134
00:13:06,084 --> 00:13:07,754
Do you want to
try something else?

135
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:09,502
Yes, please.

136
00:13:11,584 --> 00:13:16,504
I'm imagining I'm a Maori warrior, and that
bottle over there is a British soldier,

137
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:18,961
and I'm defending all my wives.

138
00:13:19,542 --> 00:13:21,708
All right, Te Kooti.

139
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:25,459
Well, you just keep the target above
the little notch in the sight.

140
00:13:25,501 --> 00:13:27,881
And then when you're ready,
you just breathe...

141
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:30,919
Bloody hell!

142
00:13:31,501 --> 00:13:32,631
So, what are we hunting?

143
00:13:32,632 --> 00:13:36,326
Oh, anything.
Deer, if we're lucky.

144
00:13:36,376 --> 00:13:38,536
Can we shoot one of
those horses up there?

145
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:40,832
Oh, I'll give... I'll give you one
guess what my answer will be.

146
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:43,294
Well, can I ride one?

147
00:13:43,334 --> 00:13:46,794
Nobody can ride them;
they're too wild.

148
00:13:46,834 --> 00:13:48,504
Why do they need
to be ridden, anyway?

149
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:50,379
Well, that's what
they're there for.

150
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:53,876
Why can't they just eat grass and
be horses and leave it at that, eh?

151
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:56,287
OK, OK. I was just
making conversation.

152
00:13:56,292 --> 00:13:57,382
ZAG BARKS Shh.

153
00:13:58,584 --> 00:14:00,674
Pig! Come on!

154
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:02,249
What?

155
00:14:30,292 --> 00:14:33,712
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
That's dinner sorted!

156
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:35,789
Whoa! Want to help me gut it?

00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:32,459
OK.

173
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:43,167
Hector, do you think it's time
we gave Ricky his present?

174
00:15:55,542 --> 00:15:57,582
Thank you, Auntie!
Thank you, Uncle!

175
00:15:57,626 --> 00:16:01,536
Feed him, clean up after him.
He's yours... you're responsible.

176
00:16:01,542 --> 00:16:03,882
This is the best
birthday I've ever had.

177
00:16:05,126 --> 00:16:07,376
I think it's the only
birthday I've ever had.

178
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:13,167
What are you gonna call him?

179
00:16:13,501 --> 00:16:17,421
Um, still thinking. Something fierce to
reflect its true nature.

180
00:16:17,626 --> 00:16:21,536
Either Psycho, Megatron...
or Tupac.

181
00:16:22,251 --> 00:16:23,581
What's a Tupac?

182
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:27,751
It's just my... this really cool rapper,
and he's, like, my best friend.

183
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:31,707
Are you gonna run away tonight?

184
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:33,792
Not sure.

185
00:16:34,042 --> 00:16:35,882
No, oh, it's cool with me.

186
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:38,629
Just make sure you're
back by breakfast.

187
00:16:40,001 --> 00:16:41,081
OK.

188
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:44,076
So happy we found you, buddy.

189
00:16:44,126 --> 00:16:46,126
Sorry it took so long.

190
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:48,167
Me too.

191
00:16:51,542 --> 00:16:52,791
Nigh-night, Ricky.

192
00:16:52,792 --> 00:16:54,542
Night, Auntie.

193
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:34,041
Where are you going, Tupac?

194
00:17:35,751 --> 00:17:38,081
Come on.

195
00:17:38,542 --> 00:17:39,672
Man!

196
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:41,962
Ohhh!

197
00:17:42,042 --> 00:17:43,752
Oh, Bella!

198
00:18:09,459 --> 00:18:11,749
You know, sometimes in life,

199
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:15,502
it seems like
there's no way out...

200
00:18:17,584 --> 00:18:22,214
like a sheep trapped in
a maze designed by wolves.

201
00:18:23,584 --> 00:18:25,924
And you know that if
you're ever in that situation,

202
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:28,879
there are always
two doors to choose from.

203
00:18:29,501 --> 00:18:30,881
And through the first door...

204
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:33,289
oh, it's easy to get through that door
and on the other side waiting

205
00:18:33,292 --> 00:18:36,422
for you are all the nummiest
treats you can imagine.

206
00:18:36,459 --> 00:18:41,749
Fanta, Doritos, L&P,
Burger Rings, Coke Zero.

207
00:18:42,209 --> 00:18:44,629
But you know what?
There's also another door,

208
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:47,706
not the Burger Ring door,
not the Fanta door;

209
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:50,171
another door that's
harder to get through.

210
00:18:50,917 --> 00:18:52,787
Guess what's on the other side?

211
00:18:53,251 --> 00:18:55,251
Anyone want to take a guess?

212
00:18:57,959 --> 00:18:59,459
Vegetables?

213
00:19:01,126 --> 00:19:04,286
N-No, not vegeta...

214
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:06,542
No.

215
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:13,329
You would think Jesus. I thought Jesus the
first time I-I-I-I came across that door.

216
00:19:13,376 --> 00:19:15,916
It's not Jesus.
It's another door.

217
00:19:16,626 --> 00:19:19,166
And guess what's on the
other side of that door?

218
00:19:22,251 --> 00:19:23,251
Jesus.

219
00:19:23,501 --> 00:19:24,881
Jesus. Yeah, Jesus.

220
00:19:25,209 --> 00:19:27,039
He's tricky like that, Jesus.

221
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:29,826
So let us pray,

222
00:19:30,376 --> 00:19:35,206
to Jesus, please, and make it a bit easier
to get through those doors, uh, to find you

223
00:19:35,209 --> 00:19:38,749
and your bounty of
delicious confectionary.

224
00:19:39,626 --> 00:19:41,576
Thank you, Selena.
Take it away.

225
00:21:00,376 --> 00:21:02,076
Dinner. It's a bit burnt.

226
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:12,247
Here.

227
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:15,792
Read this.

228
00:21:16,751 --> 00:21:18,881
Out loud.

229
00:21:20,917 --> 00:21:23,247
'From the
Child Welfare people.

230
00:21:23,792 --> 00:21:28,382
'Mr Hector Faulkner.'This is Paula
Hall from Child Welfare writing to you.

231
00:21:28,417 --> 00:21:30,707

'Sincerely, Paula Hall,

239
00:21:57,709 --> 00:21:59,749
Like hell! They can't do that!

240
00:22:00,292 --> 00:22:01,666
Yeah, they can.

241
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:05,127
But I live here now.
It's my home!

242
00:22:05,167 --> 00:22:10,287
Not any more, it isn't. Not in their eyes.
Not without a woman to run the show.

243
00:22:11,709 --> 00:22:15,669
Why don't we just get you a new wife?
There's plenty of ladies on the internet, I heard.

244
00:22:18,251 --> 00:22:19,381
Too soon?

245
00:22:19,459 --> 00:22:22,579
What if we just keep living here,
and if they try to take the farm,

246
00:22:22,626 --> 00:22:24,536
we'll just have a
shootout, like Scarface.

247
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:26,129
Except we don't
have any cocaine.

248
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,496
You can't change this, Ricky.
You're gonna go back,

249
00:22:28,584 --> 00:22:30,754
and you're gonna stick it out
in a new home. OK?

250
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:32,502
There's no way that's happening.

251
00:22:32,709 --> 00:22:34,539
Well, I'm gonna go bush. I'm
gonna...

252
00:22:34,584 --> 00:22:36,504
...disappear for a while.

253
00:22:36,584 --> 00:22:40,174
Disappear?
Yeah, that sounds more like me.

254
00:22:42,167 --> 00:22:44,417
Come on! We'll be a team!

255
00:22:44,459 --> 00:22:47,289
Oh, for God's sake. You wouldn't
last five minutes out there.

256
00:22:47,751 --> 00:22:51,381
But Auntie Bella said
you had to look after me!

257
00:22:52,167 --> 00:22:54,037
Can you just give
me some privacy?

258
00:23:07,584 --> 00:23:10,424
I heard they do experiments
at the Boys' Home...

259
00:23:10,459 --> 00:23:12,669
waterboarding, torture,
that sort of thing.

260
00:23:12,709 --> 00:23:17,169
This one boy got thrown acid on his face
because he asked for more Weet-Bix.

261
00:23:18,792 --> 00:23:21,170
Hey, you can't put
Auntie in a box.

262
00:23:21,171 --> 00:23:23,417
Give it a rest. But she wanted to go
to the sky place.

263
00:23:23,459 --> 00:23:26,579
She's gone, OK? That's life...

264
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:31,539
one day you're here, and the
next you're in a bloody box.

265
00:23:33,126 --> 00:23:35,996
Just get this into
your head, boy...

266
00:23:36,501 --> 00:23:39,581
it was Bella that wanted
you here, not me.

267
00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:42,537
I know you think this
can work, but it can't.

268
00:23:45,876 --> 00:23:49,746
So the welfare people are coming on Friday.
They're coming to get you.

269
00:23:52,584 --> 00:23:54,214
That's that, then?

270
00:23:54,251 --> 00:23:56,461
Yep... that's that.

271
00:24:23,792 --> 00:24:24,882
That's that.

272
00:24:57,376 --> 00:25:00,496
Goodbye, Ricky Baker.

273
00:25:04,459 --> 00:25:06,039

than five minutes out here.

You got yourself very lost.
I'm amazed how lost you are.

292
00:27:37,126 --> 00:27:40,376
I move fast. I've got my
own thing going on here...

293
00:27:40,417 --> 00:27:43,207
Ricky Town.
Population... Ricky.

294
00:27:43,251 --> 00:27:45,671
Yeah, well. You're going
back to Reality Town.

295
00:27:45,672 --> 00:27:47,787

296
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:48,876
Like hell.

297
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,831
I've got better things to do than to run around
the bush looking for little shits like you.

298
00:27:52,834 --> 00:27:53,674
So get up.

299
00:27:53,709 --> 00:27:54,329
I hate you.

300
00:27:54,334 --> 00:27:55,464
Well, I hate you too.

301
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,579
I hope you die.

302
00:27:56,584 --> 00:27:57,294
Me too!

303
00:27:57,334 --> 00:27:59,634
You may as well just kill me now.

304
00:28:01,792 --> 00:28:03,002
Don't kill me.

305
00:28:05,626 --> 00:28:08,126
Anyway, I'm excited
to go back to the city.

306
00:28:08,709 --> 00:28:09,709
Good.

307
00:28:09,792 --> 00:28:12,922
Can't wait.
I hate it here...

308
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:14,629
so much dirt.

309
00:28:14,876 --> 00:28:16,326
It's going to be cool.

310
00:28:16,376 --> 00:28:22,666
Get me some new gears, become a drug
dealer, a rapper, and die in a drive-by.

311
00:28:22,709 --> 00:28:24,919
Just keep an eye on
where you're going.

312
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:30,749
This is wet.

313
00:28:31,834 --> 00:28:34,791
I'm hungry.
Where are we?

314
00:28:34,792 --> 00:28:35,922
Shut it.

315
00:28:36,417 --> 00:28:38,077
I hate the bush.

316
00:28:38,126 --> 00:28:39,126
Shut it.

317
00:28:40,667 --> 00:28:42,207
My shoes are wet.

318
00:28:42,251 --> 00:28:46,711
You're the useless bugger who got lost
in the first place. You remember that.

319
00:28:47,042 --> 00:28:49,542
You don't even have a map.
Where's our map?

320
00:28:49,584 --> 00:28:51,834
Don't need one.
I know where I am.

321
00:28:52,417 --> 00:28:55,167
Probably couldn't
even read it anyway.

322
00:28:55,334 --> 00:28:57,214
Why would I need to read a map?

323
00:28:57,251 --> 00:29:01,460
I already told you... I know where I am.
Reading is stupid anyway.

324
00:29:01,461 --> 00:29:04,629
Only people who can't read
say things like that.

325
00:29:09,292 --> 00:29:10,292
What?

326
00:29:11,501 --> 00:29:14,375
No. You can't read?!

327
00:29:14,376 --> 00:29:15,126
Watch it now!

328
00:29:15,167 --> 00:29:19,037
You're like one of those people who are, like,
raised by, like, wolves or something, eh?

329
00:29:19,084 --> 00:29:21,714
Ooga booga! Me Hec...
me no read!

330
00:29:22,459 --> 00:29:25,789
What's this? This is words.
Me stupid.

331
00:29:25,834 --> 00:29:28,794
You little....!

332
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:33,629
- Ah, my foot.
- You OK?

333
00:29:33,709 --> 00:29:35,329
No. I'm not OK.

334
00:29:35,376 --> 00:29:39,286
This is all your fault, you little bastard!

335
00:29:39,417 --> 00:29:41,707
Come on, let's get
you comfortable.

336
00:29:58,042 --> 00:30:00,170
I don't really think
you're a bastard.

337
00:30:00,171 --> 00:30:03,997
Yeah, you do. That's OK, because
I think you're a bastard too.

338
00:30:04,376 --> 00:30:08,206
Anyway, it's good. It's... healthy
to get these feelings out.

339
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:11,752
Can you move it yet?'

340
00:30:11,792 --> 00:30:15,672
Course I can't. It's fractured.
Take weeks to heal.

341
00:30:16,001 --> 00:30:19,251
OK, Debbie Downer, can we think
of something more positive?

342
00:30:20,001 --> 00:30:23,416
Maybe you could... write a
haiku to express your feelings.

343
00:30:23,417 --> 00:30:24,417
A what?

344
00:30:27,667 --> 00:30:29,827
Lost in the forest.

345
00:30:30,876 --> 00:30:34,286
A sore ankle, poor uncle.

346
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:37,252
Oh well, never mind.

347
00:30:37,751 --> 00:30:40,211
Oh God, we really need
to get out of here.

348
00:30:40,251 --> 00:30:41,501
Do you want me to go find help?

349
00:30:43,459 --> 00:30:44,629
I'd die, wouldn't I?

350
00:30:44,834 --> 00:30:47,584
No, we've got no choice but to
camp out here for a few weeks.

351
00:30:47,626 --> 00:30:48,626
But I'm hungry!

352
00:30:49,042 --> 00:30:51,041
There's plenty to eat
if you know where to look.

353
00:30:51,042 --> 00:30:52,962
Well, I don't know where
to look Hector.

354
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:55,750
And also, I ran out of toilet paper.
Give me some of yours.

355
00:30:55,751 --> 00:30:56,671
Eh?

356
00:30:56,709 --> 00:31:00,329
I've gotta poop. I need a poop,
you need a poop. We all poop.

357
00:31:00,334 --> 00:31:01,884
Use a leaf.

358
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:03,249
A leaf?

359
00:31:03,459 --> 00:31:05,749
I hate you.

360
00:31:06,251 --> 00:31:07,211
And bury it!

361
00:31:07,212 --> 00:31:08,919
I'll bury you.

362
00:31:14,834 --> 00:31:17,214
This ain't no
charred foster kid.

363
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,421
How can you tell, Paula?

364
00:31:20,084 --> 00:31:22,924
Does this look like a
human head to you, Andy?

365
00:31:28,126 --> 00:31:29,496
Where are you, Ricky Baker?

366
00:31:29,501 --> 00:31:33,421
Hey, I reckon the old man chopped him up,
buried him somewhere...

367
00:31:35,459 --> 00:31:36,459
Or ate him.

368
00:31:37,292 --> 00:31:39,422
Something definitely happened,

369
00:31:40,084 --> 00:31:41,421
but I'm wondering what.

370
00:31:41,422 --> 00:31:45,537
OK, I'm gonna need you to shutup, Andy,
because you're doing my frickin' head in.

371
00:31:46,334 --> 00:31:47,750
Come on, let's go.

372
00:31:47,751 --> 00:31:50,461
This ain't over by
a Mangaweka mile.

373
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:53,002
Get me the police.
It's an emergency.

374
00:31:53,042 --> 00:31:54,310
Hey, whoa, Paula.
I am the police.

375
00:31:54,334 --> 00:31:57,384
I mean real ones, Andy.
Ones with guns.

376
00:32:10,417 --> 00:32:14,497
♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Yeah.

377
00:32:36,376 --> 00:32:39,166
Hey, Uncle, wanna
listen to my Walkman?

378
00:32:40,126 --> 00:32:41,126
No.

379
00:32:44,626 --> 00:32:45,826
Where are you going?

380
00:32:46,001 --> 00:32:46,751
Hunting.

381
00:32:46,752 --> 00:32:48,171
Like hell.

382
00:32:50,126 --> 00:32:51,126
You can thank me later.

383
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:52,291
Tupac!

384
00:32:52,417 --> 00:32:54,627
TUPAC BARKS Yeah, yeah.

385
00:33:40,001 --> 00:33:42,581
Did you get any food?

386
00:33:42,959 --> 00:33:44,669
What the hell is that?

387
00:33:44,709 --> 00:33:45,789
Salad.

388
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:50,132
What? I'd like to see
you do any better.

389
00:33:58,876 --> 00:34:03,496
Never eaten a slug before.
Where did you get it?

390
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:06,456
It's an eel.
Got it down the creek.

391
00:34:07,501 --> 00:34:09,211
Yeah, but how? With what?

392
00:34:09,542 --> 00:34:12,292
Oh, I don't know. The knack.

393
00:34:12,876 --> 00:34:16,076
Oh yeah, the knack.
What's that? How do you get it?

394
00:34:16,626 --> 00:34:18,416
It's not a thing. It's just...

395
00:34:19,751 --> 00:34:21,961
You just get it. It's a...

396
00:34:22,376 --> 00:34:23,666
Oh, it's a way of, um...

397
00:34:24,417 --> 00:34:27,957
it's a way of figuring things out
without having to think too hard or...

398
00:34:28,459 --> 00:34:30,459
or talk, more importantly.

399
00:34:32,167 --> 00:34:35,877
You know, most people who die in
the bush... they're found naked.

400
00:34:36,292 --> 00:34:37,132
Ew.

401
00:34:37,133 --> 00:34:40,456
Yeah, they panic, and they think their
clothes are slowing them down.

402
00:34:40,501 --> 00:34:43,250
They throw them away, and
then the cold gets to them.

403
00:34:43,251 --> 00:34:46,791
But the trick is...
this is the knack...

404
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:50,793
you stay calm, you look for water,
you follow it to high ground

405
00:34:50,794 --> 00:34:52,712
until you can see
what's going on.

406
00:34:55,376 --> 00:34:58,376
What would you do if I got
lost today? Would you miss me?

407
00:35:00,209 --> 00:35:05,379
Well, you... you didn't get lost,
so... that's good.

408
00:35:06,501 --> 00:35:08,375
Do you miss Auntie Bella?

409
00:35:08,376 --> 00:35:09,826
Shh.

410
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:13,789
Yeah, you're still processing.

411
00:35:14,834 --> 00:35:19,334
You got to do that when sad
things happen... process it.

412
00:35:20,459 --> 00:35:25,039
That's like when my mate Amber died.
I processed that for ages.

413
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:28,172
Who's Amber?

414
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,711
We were in a home
together for a while,

415
00:35:31,834 --> 00:35:36,214
and she went to this new family and
then started getting in trouble,

416
00:35:36,251 --> 00:35:38,041
telling stories about the dad.

417
00:35:39,459 --> 00:35:41,919
And then one day
she was just dead.

418
00:35:43,084 --> 00:35:45,084
What do you mean dead?
How?

419
00:35:45,876 --> 00:35:48,036
Don't know.
No one told me.

420
00:35:56,751 --> 00:35:58,881
This slug is actually
pretty good.

421
00:36:12,501 --> 00:36:15,581
Come on, it's time
to get out of here.

422
00:36:22,917 --> 00:36:27,877
Yes! Yes! Yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes! Yes!

423
00:36:28,251 --> 00:36:32,001
OK. We'll stay here the night, and we'll
be back at the farm by tomorrow arvo.

424
00:36:33,751 --> 00:36:34,875
Yes!

425
00:36:34,876 --> 00:36:37,626
There's beds, books!

426
00:36:38,001 --> 00:36:41,381
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
Toilet paper!

427
00:36:41,417 --> 00:36:43,787
- A nice, warm fire. DOGS BARK
- Get out, you mongrels.

428
00:36:43,792 --> 00:36:48,632
Come on. Come on. Give me some bars so
I can communicate with the outside world.

429
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:49,287
Ricky,...

430
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:52,497
take a look at this.

431
00:36:53,084 --> 00:36:54,964
Oh, Uncle. We're famous!

432
00:36:57,001 --> 00:37:00,831
'Hector Faulkner,
65, and Richard Baker, 13,

433
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:03,504
'have been missing
now for six weeks.

434
00:37:03,542 --> 00:37:05,422
'Faulkner is Cauc...

435
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:08,172
'Cauc... Asian.'

436
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:11,076
Wow, they got that wrong,
because you're obviously white.

437
00:37:12,292 --> 00:37:16,792
'There is a fear for Faulkner's mental health
following the recent death of his wife.

438
00:37:17,126 --> 00:37:19,996
'Police are not ruling
out kidnapping.' Kidnapping!

439
00:37:20,042 --> 00:37:23,002
'Park rangers have been alerted
for anyone seeing the pair

440
00:37:23,003 --> 00:37:26,210
'should report back to the
nearest police station.' Ho!

441
00:37:26,211 --> 00:37:30,749
Uncle, you're basically a criminal now.
But on the bright side, you're famous.

442
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,672
They think I'm crazy.

443
00:37:34,709 --> 00:37:36,499
And Asian.

444
00:37:42,959 --> 00:37:46,579
Hey, you know when the Wildebeests migrate,
they walk up to a thousand miles.

445
00:37:46,584 --> 00:37:47,750
Is that heaps?

446
00:37:47,751 --> 00:37:49,331
Yeah. Heaps.

447
00:37:49,542 --> 00:37:50,750
Just like us.

448
00:37:50,751 --> 00:37:54,711
Walking, walking,
trying to get somewhere.

449
00:37:55,084 --> 00:38:00,214
Looking for a better home.

450
00:38:00,376 --> 00:38:02,246
Gidday.

451
00:38:06,042 --> 00:38:08,212
Jeez, eh. Whoo.

452
00:38:08,626 --> 00:38:10,626
Got a lot of explaining to do.

453
00:38:10,667 --> 00:38:12,497
A lot of people
looking for you two.

454
00:38:12,542 --> 00:38:13,542
Yeah, we know.

455
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:18,832
I did my ankle back in one of the valleys.
And, uh, we're on the way out now.

456
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:23,711
Well,...

457
00:38:25,542 --> 00:38:27,832
wait till they hear
we caught you in a hut.

458
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:31,829
Well, we weren't hiding,

459
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:35,036
The boy got himself lost,
and, uh, I'm bringing him back.

460
00:38:35,084 --> 00:38:39,044
Whoa. Cool gun, bro.

461
00:38:39,334 --> 00:38:42,174
What do you guys shoot with this?
Sparrows?

462
00:38:42,209 --> 00:38:44,499
Mm, sometimes.

463
00:38:47,709 --> 00:38:48,879
He hurt you, son?

464
00:38:49,376 --> 00:38:51,786
Nah. I fell in some
prickles one time.

465
00:38:51,792 --> 00:38:53,382
Did he push you
in those prickles?

466
00:38:53,459 --> 00:38:56,128
Yeah, probably. Did he push
you in the prickles, mate?

467
00:38:56,129 --> 00:38:57,166
Leave him alone.

468
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:58,829
You shut your trap, old fulla.

469
00:38:59,917 --> 00:39:02,747
I'd go get some rest if I was you.
You've got a long walk tomorrow.

470
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:07,002
First of all, you
watch how you talk to me.

471
00:39:07,751 --> 00:39:08,831
And second of all,

472
00:39:09,376 --> 00:39:11,626
you can take him,
but I'm staying here.

473
00:39:12,001 --> 00:39:14,171
Like hell. People want answers.

474
00:39:14,209 --> 00:39:15,629
Yeah, answers.

475
00:39:15,709 --> 00:39:19,289
Look, we got lost; I got injured.
He's fine. It was basically a holiday.

476
00:39:19,334 --> 00:39:22,254
Not a real holiday,
because he made me do stuff.

477
00:39:24,834 --> 00:39:25,834
Like what?

478
00:39:26,084 --> 00:39:30,334
Just stuff. He had a sore leg,
so he made me do things for him.

479
00:39:30,709 --> 00:39:36,999
It was hard at first, because my hands
are so soft. But I got used to it.

480
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:41,497
I didn't really want to do it,
but it was the only way to survive.

481
00:39:43,042 --> 00:39:46,672
Well, it wasn't always hard.
Sometimes I got to do my own thing.

482
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:49,997
He pretty much never
joined in with me, though.

483
00:39:50,001 --> 00:39:52,331
I asked if he wanted
to play with me, but...

484
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:56,459
he would just make
me play with myself.

485
00:39:59,167 --> 00:40:00,957
I feel sick. I feel sick, Hugh.

486
00:40:01,001 --> 00:40:03,961
Well... Hang on. He doesn't
know what he means.

487
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,791
You're a bloody pervert.

488
00:40:05,834 --> 00:40:06,754
What did you call me?

489
00:40:06,755 --> 00:40:08,961
You heard him. Yeah, you
heard him, you old perv.

490
00:40:09,001 --> 00:40:11,131
Hey! He's not a pervert,
you dickhead!

491
00:40:11,167 --> 00:40:11,787
Shut up Ricky.

492
00:40:11,834 --> 00:40:13,174
Yeah, shut up, Ricky.

493
00:40:13,209 --> 00:40:15,249
Hey, only I get to
tell him to shut up.

494
00:40:15,251 --> 00:40:17,001
Oooh. Brainwasher.

495
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:22,172
You're going to jail,
you pervert.

496
00:40:22,209 --> 00:40:24,379
Want to say that again?

497
00:40:24,417 --> 00:40:26,207
Say it again.

498
00:40:26,501 --> 00:40:27,961
Going to jail,...

499
00:40:32,334 --> 00:40:34,084
you pervert.

500
00:40:44,334 --> 00:40:47,174
Get off, you mongrel!

501
00:40:48,792 --> 00:40:50,832
Shit just got real!

502
00:40:51,167 --> 00:40:53,827
Back up, homies, and
let go of my uncle!

503
00:40:53,876 --> 00:40:57,666
It's OK, kid. You can put it down.
He won't hurt you anymore.

504
00:40:58,459 --> 00:41:01,959
I said get away from my uncle.

505
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:05,001
Ricky, give me that.

506
00:41:07,001 --> 00:41:08,041
Get down!

507
00:41:08,792 --> 00:41:13,502
Ricky, get their guns. Take the bolts out.
We're getting out of here.

508
00:41:14,917 --> 00:41:19,497
Yeah. Shit just got real.

509
00:41:20,042 --> 00:41:21,042
Hey!

510
00:41:21,834 --> 00:41:23,214
You're dead, old man.

511
00:41:23,251 --> 00:41:26,421
Yeah, dead meat, you old perv!

512
00:41:30,001 --> 00:41:33,671
You've had it, mate!
There's no chance for you!

513
00:41:34,709 --> 00:41:37,079
Get up.

514
00:41:39,542 --> 00:41:42,582
Straight up that was the most
gangster shit I've ever done.

515
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:46,254
You idiot. And what were you talking about
back there? Do you know what that sounds like?

516
00:41:46,292 --> 00:41:47,332
No!

517
00:41:49,042 --> 00:41:50,172
Ohhh!

518
00:41:50,251 --> 00:41:51,518
They're gonna put
me away for sure.

519
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:53,422
Bastards. Yeah, bastards.

520
00:41:53,459 --> 00:41:55,419
Hear what that guy called me?
Pervert!

521
00:41:55,459 --> 00:41:56,289
We need more guns,...

522
00:41:56,292 --> 00:41:57,382
Oh God. What am I gonna do?

523
00:41:57,417 --> 00:41:58,417
Hand grenades,...

524
00:41:58,459 --> 00:42:01,539
maybe a rocket launcher.
They're gonna come for us.

525
00:42:01,542 --> 00:42:02,582
Yeah, Police.

526
00:42:02,626 --> 00:42:03,536
Awesome.

527
00:42:03,584 --> 00:42:05,714
No, it's not awesome,
Ricky, it's serious.

528
00:42:05,751 --> 00:42:07,879
Yeah, but no one got hurt.
You're not dangerous.

529
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,496
Yeah, well, I am to them.

530
00:42:10,001 --> 00:42:10,791
I've been to prison.

531
00:42:10,792 --> 00:42:13,132
Gangster! For what?

532
00:42:13,501 --> 00:42:14,541
Manslaughter.

533
00:42:14,584 --> 00:42:16,634
Double gangster!
You need a teardrop tattoo.

534
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:19,247
Oh, I was young.
It was a drunken fight.

535
00:42:19,751 --> 00:42:22,461
Did my time, but...
they won't see it like that.

536
00:42:22,751 --> 00:42:24,750
I'll just tell them you
were looking after me.

537
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:26,727
It doesn't matter what you tell them;
they won't believe you.

538
00:42:26,751 --> 00:42:28,381
They'll think I made you do it.

539
00:42:28,876 --> 00:42:30,956
I'm not going back to jail.
I'm better off up here.

540
00:42:31,334 --> 00:42:34,084
This is no place for a kid.
You're going to have to go back, Ricky.

541
00:42:34,126 --> 00:42:34,916
To what?

542
00:42:34,959 --> 00:42:36,789
- Well, to the welfare people.
- No.

543
00:42:36,834 --> 00:42:38,292
- They'll look after you.
- No, they won't.

544
00:42:38,293 --> 00:42:39,672
They'll find you another home.
You'll be fine.

545
00:42:39,673 --> 00:42:41,417
No. You're not listening!

546
00:42:41,459 --> 00:42:44,749
Nobody listens. There's no
more homes, just juvie!

547
00:42:44,792 --> 00:42:46,172
What's juvie?

548
00:42:46,376 --> 00:42:48,376
Juvenile prison.

549
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:52,169
They don't care
about kids like me.

550
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,417
They just keep moving
us around until...

551
00:42:54,459 --> 00:42:57,829
something happens,
like... Amber.

552
00:43:03,501 --> 00:43:06,001
Oh, no. Bugger that.

553
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:11,826
OK, OK. We're in about a million
hectares of bush... that's big.

554
00:43:11,876 --> 00:43:13,826
It's big enough to hide in
for a while, anyway.

555
00:43:13,876 --> 00:43:14,826
Good enough for me.

556
00:43:14,834 --> 00:43:16,004
But we're heading into winter.

557
00:43:16,005 --> 00:43:18,501
It's gonna be rough... no huts,
no tents, real bush life.

558
00:43:18,542 --> 00:43:19,502
Can you handle that?

559
00:43:19,542 --> 00:43:20,582
I can handle it.

560
00:43:20,667 --> 00:43:23,747
Yeah. And if you
play up, I dump ya.

561
00:43:23,792 --> 00:43:24,632
OK, Uncle.

562
00:43:24,667 --> 00:43:26,787
I'd still prefer if
you don't call me Uncle.

563
00:43:26,834 --> 00:43:30,334
OK, Hec. So what do we do now?

564
00:43:30,917 --> 00:43:32,457
We run.

565
00:43:37,501 --> 00:43:38,461
Wait, wait, wait.

566
00:43:38,501 --> 00:43:39,958
No, no.

567
00:43:39,959 --> 00:43:41,129
No, we don't need to run.

568
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:44,326
Oh yeah.
Let's just fast walk.

569
00:43:44,334 --> 00:43:46,134

I don't think that's a word.

597
00:45:56,501 --> 00:45:58,211
Majestical? Sure it is.

598
00:45:58,751 --> 00:46:00,291
Nah, it's not real.

599
00:46:00,667 --> 00:46:02,247
What would you know?

600
00:46:02,584 --> 00:46:04,254
It's 'majestic.'

601
00:46:04,792 --> 00:46:06,832
Well, that doesn't
sound very special.

602
00:46:07,584 --> 00:46:09,754
'Majestical' is way better.

603
00:46:11,501 --> 00:46:13,631
What do you reckon this
place is called, anyway?

604
00:46:14,501 --> 00:46:18,750
Do you think it's that place where the
cloak gets wet by the sky or something?

605
00:46:18,751 --> 00:46:20,431
I don't know. What the
hell does that mean?

606
00:46:20,792 --> 00:46:22,792
Auntie Bella said she
was from up here...

607
00:46:22,917 --> 00:46:25,627
from this special lake
that almost touches the sky.

608
00:46:25,709 --> 00:46:28,789
Mate, Bella didn't
know where she was from.

609
00:46:28,792 --> 00:46:29,916
Nah, she said...

610
00:46:29,917 --> 00:46:31,457
No. She was making it up.

611
00:46:31,584 --> 00:46:36,884
Look... Bella didn't have any
family. Like you. Like me.

612
00:46:37,167 --> 00:46:41,457
That's why she wanted to look after you...
and took pity on me.

613
00:46:41,709 --> 00:46:45,789
She wanted to save us poor wretches
when no one else wanted us.

614
00:46:47,126 --> 00:46:49,206
Like rescue dogs.

615
00:46:51,126 --> 00:46:54,536
That's the way she was.
Heart of gold.

616
00:47:01,001 --> 00:47:03,291
Yeah, it's majestical.

617
00:47:05,542 --> 00:47:07,672
May as well camp, eh?

618
00:47:08,876 --> 00:47:10,746
Sun is going down.

619
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:22,166
Developing story now,
more on this massive national manhunt.

620
00:47:22,209 --> 00:47:26,039
Yes, we've got Paula Hall from
the Department of Child Welfare with us.

621
00:47:26,084 --> 00:47:27,630
Paula, thank you
for being here...

622
00:47:27,631 --> 00:47:31,076
Tell us about this boy. What kind
of character are we talking about?

623
00:47:31,126 --> 00:47:31,826
Well, look, we're...

624
00:47:31,876 --> 00:47:35,246
We're talking about a young boy
who is capable of stealing,

625
00:47:35,251 --> 00:47:39,671
spitting, breaking stuff,
kicking stuff, defacing stuff,

626
00:47:40,126 --> 00:47:45,875
stealing stuff, burning stuff and, uh,
loitering and graffiti-ing. Yeah.

627
00:47:45,876 --> 00:47:49,786
Mm. Even so, Paula, he's just a kid, right?
He's alone in the bush. He's scared.

628
00:47:49,792 --> 00:47:53,502
Scared? No, no. He's not...
He's not a scared little kid.

629
00:47:53,542 --> 00:47:56,632
He's a spanner in the works, and I'm the
mechanic who is gonna take that spanner

630
00:47:56,633 --> 00:47:58,875
and put him back in the toolbox...
OK...

631
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:03,876
Where here he belongs.
No child left behind. No child left behind.

632
00:48:03,917 --> 00:48:05,747
No child left behind.

633
00:48:07,626 --> 00:48:09,326
He'll know what that means.

634
00:48:09,876 --> 00:48:11,206
OK.

635
00:48:23,792 --> 00:48:24,792
Any luck?

636
00:48:25,042 --> 00:48:27,172
We're somewhere
in this green bit.

637
00:48:28,751 --> 00:48:31,961
Well, people used to live here,
so we can't be that lost.

638
00:48:32,959 --> 00:48:35,919
They probably got lost too,
and then just gave up.

639
00:48:36,626 --> 00:48:38,576
We'll probably die here.

640
00:48:38,626 --> 00:48:39,956
Well, anything to shut you up.

641
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:42,961
I'll shut up if that
stupid bird shuts up.

642
00:48:43,876 --> 00:48:46,166
Shut up, stupid bird!

643
00:48:46,209 --> 00:48:47,209
Shh.

644
00:48:47,417 --> 00:48:48,417
Just watch.

645
00:48:49,376 --> 00:48:52,706
Huh. Never seen a dumb
bird like that before.

646
00:48:54,876 --> 00:48:56,706
Just watch.

647
00:49:00,751 --> 00:49:02,751
It's a huia.

648
00:49:06,417 --> 00:49:08,247
I reckon that bird was a huia.

649
00:49:08,959 --> 00:49:10,169
Supposed to be extinct.

650
00:49:10,459 --> 00:49:12,129
That's pretty rare.

651
00:49:12,376 --> 00:49:17,376
Mate,... I reckon there'd be a lot of people
interested in seeing something like that.

652
00:49:17,459 --> 00:49:21,129
And the people who discovered
them would be... pretty famous.

653
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:23,746
Yeah, probably some
money in it too.

654
00:49:23,751 --> 00:49:27,171
Mind you, need some
photos to prove it.

655
00:49:28,167 --> 00:49:30,037
We don't have a camera.

656
00:49:31,209 --> 00:49:33,079
When was the last
time you washed?

657
00:49:33,251 --> 00:49:34,881
About a month ago.

658
00:49:35,084 --> 00:49:37,004
Well, that's not enough, eh?

659
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:56,832
OK, mate. Let's go.

660
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:03,921
What have you got there mate?

661
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:05,749
Huh? Oh books.

662
00:50:06,167 --> 00:50:09,747
Books? Bloody books.
Look for food and warm stuff.

663
00:50:10,001 --> 00:50:13,461
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Keep your pants on.

664
00:50:16,834 --> 00:50:18,754
Jeez. That's a ranger.

665
00:50:19,709 --> 00:50:20,749
Oh, he's dead.

666
00:50:24,334 --> 00:50:25,334
Oh Jeez.

667
00:50:25,917 --> 00:50:27,627
You all right, mate?
What's the matter?

668
00:50:29,001 --> 00:50:30,711
Ricky, we've got
to do something.

669
00:50:30,959 --> 00:50:33,878
Are you going to manslaughter him?
Because I don't think I can watch.

670
00:50:33,879 --> 00:50:37,076
No, you idiot. I'm...
We've got to get him some help.

671
00:50:37,126 --> 00:50:39,786
There's a track down to a river; there's
some bush people that live down there.

672
00:50:39,792 --> 00:50:40,961
It's about a two-hour trek.

673
00:50:40,962 --> 00:50:42,459
We can make it before dark.

674
00:50:43,667 --> 00:50:46,147
Well, someone has got to stay
behind and look after this bloke.

675
00:50:47,667 --> 00:50:48,707
Have fun.

676
00:50:48,876 --> 00:50:51,996
Now don't go wandering
just stick to the tracks.

677
00:50:52,334 --> 00:50:55,750
If you get desperate,...
eat your dog.

678
00:50:55,751 --> 00:50:56,751
What?

679
00:50:57,084 --> 00:51:00,924
You'll be right, mate.
Just bloody well come back, OK?

680
00:51:00,959 --> 00:51:01,959
OK.

681
00:51:36,501 --> 00:51:38,671
What do you think you're
doing out here, freaky kid?

682
00:51:38,959 --> 00:51:40,749
There's a sick man
up at Carrington Hut

683
00:51:40,792 --> 00:51:44,002
He can't walk, and he's having trouble
breathing. Can you radio in a chopper?

684
00:51:44,042 --> 00:51:46,132
OK. Sweet as.

685
00:51:47,042 --> 00:51:52,752
'Uh, yeah, we need a helicopter
up here ASAP. Over.'

686
00:51:53,667 --> 00:51:55,627
Does it look like
I carry a radio?

687
00:51:55,667 --> 00:51:56,827
What's wrong with him?

688
00:51:56,834 --> 00:51:58,294
I don't know.
He might be dying.

689
00:51:58,334 --> 00:52:02,424
Ew. Oh, OK. Come on,
we'll go call the cop.

690
00:52:04,792 --> 00:52:07,922
Get on, man.

691
00:52:27,709 --> 00:52:31,749
I've already told you, Bruce up at Carrington
Hut. He's probably already dead by now.

692
00:52:31,792 --> 00:52:33,002
Do you want some ice cream?

693
00:52:33,042 --> 00:52:37,002
How should I know? Do your job,
fly up there and take a look.

694
00:52:37,084 --> 00:52:39,584
I already told you that,
but you're not listening.

695
00:52:39,626 --> 00:52:41,786
Oh, yes, I do. I can. Uh...

696
00:52:42,001 --> 00:52:43,250
You want a sausage? Yeah, yeah. Do that.

697
00:52:43,251 --> 00:52:46,921
Yeah, I'll tell him. Laters.

698
00:52:47,042 --> 00:52:49,143
They're gonna head up there
first thing in the morning.

699
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:52,787
Better go, then. Got to get there before
they do so I can warn Uncle...

700
00:52:52,834 --> 00:52:55,754
Relax, bro. I know who you are.
I've seen your picture in the paper.

701
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:58,381
Except you're skinnier
in real life.

702
00:52:58,792 --> 00:53:00,422
Where's your parents?

703
00:53:00,459 --> 00:53:01,459
Dead.

704
00:53:03,292 --> 00:53:06,502
Nah, jokes. My, um, dad, he's
watching the league with my uncle,

705
00:53:06,503 --> 00:53:08,750
and my mum, she's working at the lodge.

706
00:53:08,751 --> 00:53:10,081
Do you want to smoke a joint?

707
00:53:11,292 --> 00:53:14,961
Nah, I'm just being a dick. I don't smoke.
I'm talking heaps eh?

708
00:53:14,962 --> 00:53:19,169
Yeah, people say I talk too much. You
don't talk much, eh? I can talk for ages.

709
00:53:19,209 --> 00:53:22,129
If you want me to talk for ages,
or if you don't me to talk,

710
00:53:22,167 --> 00:53:23,747
just tell me if you
don't want me to talk.

711
00:53:23,751 --> 00:53:26,711
Like, this one time I was school,
and I was talking too much,

712
00:53:26,751 --> 00:53:27,921
and the teacher walks in...

713
00:53:31,667 --> 00:53:34,377
I'm not listening to her,
because she's my Auntie...

714
00:53:35,501 --> 00:53:43,501
♪ Only the crumbliest, flakiest
chocolate. Tastes like...

715
00:53:43,917 --> 00:53:45,157
But then I just kept talking...

716
00:53:46,709 --> 00:53:51,999
Hey, bub. Far out those bloody
Warriors are useless! Koretux.

717
00:53:52,251 --> 00:53:54,421
That's my dad.

718
00:53:54,459 --> 00:53:56,039
They are killing me.

719
00:53:57,209 --> 00:53:58,329
Hey.

720
00:54:00,126 --> 00:54:02,496
You're him. You're you!
That's him!

721
00:54:02,542 --> 00:54:06,582
Oh, Ricky Baker in my house.
You want, uh, anything?

722
00:54:06,584 --> 00:54:10,634
Sausage, bro? We've got heaps
of sausages, brother. Far...

723
00:54:10,792 --> 00:54:14,792
I hate to ask you this, Ricky,
but I'll kick myself if I don't.

724
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:16,384
Um,...

725
00:54:17,876 --> 00:54:19,996
Can I have a selfie, please?

726
00:54:20,626 --> 00:54:24,326
Yeah? Yeah?
Far! oh my goodness.

727
00:54:24,334 --> 00:54:27,714
The boys are gonna be
buzzing on this one.

728
00:54:28,334 --> 00:54:30,254
Big smile. Big smile.

729
00:54:30,376 --> 00:54:32,456
Sad face. Sad face.

730
00:54:34,167 --> 00:54:36,077
Just take a quick selfie of us.

731
00:54:36,126 --> 00:54:37,727
It's not a selfie if
I take it, you idiot.

732
00:54:37,751 --> 00:54:41,421
Oh, come on. Just pretend
I'm the head to his body. CLICK!

733
00:54:41,459 --> 00:54:43,919
I captured Ricky Baker!

734
00:54:44,709 --> 00:54:47,499
Yeah, you captured me too.
You captured me.

735
00:54:47,542 --> 00:54:49,922
Oh no!

736
00:54:49,959 --> 00:54:54,249
Yeah. Chur, my bro. Chur.
Thank you, my bro.

737
00:54:54,251 --> 00:54:58,041
Been awesome meeting you, Ricky.
Just keep doing what you're doing, man.

738
00:54:58,084 --> 00:55:01,583
Keep striving. Stay Maori, bro.
We need a couple more Maoris like you.

739
00:55:01,584 --> 00:55:03,464
Oh, shut up. No, you shut up, eh.

740
00:55:03,465 --> 00:55:04,879
Yeah, get out.

741
00:55:04,917 --> 00:55:08,627
I'm imparting my knowledge on
the bro. You're the man for me.

742
00:55:08,667 --> 00:55:11,327
You're a boy, but you're a man.

743
00:55:12,126 --> 00:55:17,876
Bro. I love you,
Ricky.

744
00:55:24,626 --> 00:55:27,706
Why are you on the run?
Don't you want a normal life?

745
00:55:29,251 --> 00:55:30,631
Don't know. Maybe.

746
00:55:31,501 --> 00:55:33,671
You fullas could come live here.
They'll never find you.

747
00:55:33,672 --> 00:55:35,417
Nobody ever comes in here.

748
00:55:35,959 --> 00:55:37,629
I have to ask Uncle first.

749
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:40,631
They say he's dangerous.
You guys get along?

750
00:55:40,667 --> 00:55:43,627
Yeah, we're like best friends.
We get on so well.

751
00:55:43,751 --> 00:55:46,129
He's, like, one of the best
bushmans in the whole country.

752
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:48,126
He, like, teached me
all of his skills,

753
00:55:48,167 --> 00:55:51,377
so now we're, like,
equal best bushmen in the country.

754
00:55:51,378 --> 00:55:53,036
Yeah, we're best friends.

755
00:55:54,042 --> 00:55:55,882
Oh, where's your mum and dad?

756
00:55:55,917 --> 00:56:00,207
Don't know who my dad was, and my mum
got rid of me when I was little.

757
00:56:02,001 --> 00:56:05,251
Oh, you know where she is?
You ever met her?

758
00:56:06,251 --> 00:56:08,381
You know anything about her?

759
00:56:17,542 --> 00:56:21,962
Oh, pretty. She must've had
you when she was a teenager.

760
00:56:23,417 --> 00:56:25,207
You ever try and find her?

761
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:30,504
Oh, you don't have to.
She should find you.

762
00:56:31,209 --> 00:56:33,959
What do you reckon you'd say
to her if you ever met her?

763
00:56:35,084 --> 00:56:37,924
Don't know. Never
really think about it.

764
00:56:38,959 --> 00:56:40,919
You want to hear a song I wrote?

765
00:56:42,167 --> 00:56:44,877
OK. Here goes.
It's an original.

766
00:56:52,167 --> 00:56:55,077
♪ Turn your lights down low.

767
00:56:55,292 --> 00:56:58,382
OK, I lied. It's
not an original.

768
00:56:58,417 --> 00:57:04,417
♪ And pull your window curtains.
♪ Your window curtains.

769
00:57:12,334 --> 00:57:17,334

Yeah bro, you slept in.

773
00:57:38,459 --> 00:57:40,079
Oh no!

774
00:57:51,251 --> 00:57:54,251
Man, we gotta work
on your dismounts.

00:57:55,251 --> 00:57:56,631
You all good from here?

00:57:56,792 --> 00:57:58,502
Yeah.

777
00:57:59,167 --> 00:58:01,377
OK, Ricky bro, catch you up.

778
00:58:02,126 --> 00:58:03,456
Catch you up.

779
00:58:13,667 --> 00:58:15,127
Uncle!

780
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:16,577
Tupac, come on!

781
00:58:22,251 --> 00:58:24,916
Oh no!

782
00:58:24,917 --> 00:58:26,247
Ninjas!

00:58:26,834 --> 00:58:28,884
Dire wolves!

784
00:58:30,292 --> 00:58:32,502
Child Welfare!

785
00:58:36,251 --> 00:58:40,381
Where did they go?
Where did they go?!

786
00:58:40,417 --> 00:58:42,747
I know you know something.

787
00:58:43,209 --> 00:58:46,999
Paula, he's the ranger. He had
diabetes. They saved his life.

788
00:58:47,042 --> 00:58:48,211
Oh, spare me, Andy.

789
00:58:48,212 --> 00:58:49,749
This is Gavin, our tech guy.

790
00:58:49,834 --> 00:58:53,214
Gav, Paula Hall, Child Welfare
Services. No child left behind.

791
00:58:53,251 --> 00:58:55,500
So, talk to me, Gav.
What's the situation?

792
00:58:55,501 --> 00:58:59,331
Uh, well, the hut is empty so they
must've left before we got here.

793
00:58:59,376 --> 00:59:01,416
Ooh, you worked that
out on your own, Gav?

794
00:59:02,334 --> 00:59:03,833
OK, what else?

795
00:59:03,834 --> 00:59:06,794
Well, uh, we've, ah, set up a rendezvous
spot here for the search party.

796
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:09,964
And, uh, then we can
bring in, uh, Stingray.

797
00:59:10,001 --> 00:59:11,791
Stingray? Talk to me,
talk to me.

798
00:59:11,834 --> 00:59:16,424
Oh, well basically it's just a portable cell
phone tower that emits a false frequency.

799
00:59:16,459 --> 00:59:20,879
So any cell phone in a 5 K radius will latch
on, thinking it's an ordinary network.

800
00:59:20,917 --> 00:59:24,327
Frickin' A, brother.
That's some 'five eyes' shit right there.

801
00:59:24,376 --> 00:59:28,996
OK. Them clowns is
about to get Stingray-ed.

802
00:59:30,417 --> 00:59:35,077
Uncle, Uncle, Uncle.
Think, think, think, think.

803
00:59:35,501 --> 00:59:37,791
Oh! Tupac, find Zag.

804
00:59:39,376 --> 00:59:42,666
Oh, you're useless.
Oh! Think, Ricky, think.

805
00:59:42,709 --> 00:59:45,209
What would Uncle
do? What would Uncle do?

806
00:59:45,251 --> 00:59:49,211
Oh yes. Yes! Find water,
and then go to higher ground.

807
00:59:49,251 --> 00:59:50,581
And don't get naked.

808
01:00:02,001 --> 01:00:04,250
Ricky Baker and
Hector Faulkner...

809
01:00:04,251 --> 01:00:08,631
two renegade outlaws on
the run for four months now,

810
01:00:08,667 --> 01:00:11,787
and fast becoming
legends here in NZ.

811
01:00:12,584 --> 01:00:15,916
Faulkner and Baker's
popularity is on the rise

812
01:00:15,917 --> 01:00:20,537
after a valiant effort to save
a critically ill park ranger.

813
01:00:21,542 --> 01:00:26,252
The forces are circling against them,
and I am reminded of 'First Blood'.

814
01:00:26,542 --> 01:00:31,000
John Rambo, a man alone...
obviously they're two men alone...

815
01:00:31,001 --> 01:00:36,625
out there somewhere beyond the cutty
grass in this dense, thick bush.

816
01:00:36,626 --> 01:00:40,576
OK? Easy, efficient,
economic. All right, guys?

817
01:00:41,084 --> 01:00:43,044
Take us back a step.
What happened in...?

818
01:00:43,084 --> 01:00:45,924
Uh, I lost control and, uh,
I gave him the beating of his life.

819
01:00:45,959 --> 01:00:47,209
Yeah, you got him good.

820
01:00:47,251 --> 01:00:51,750
We're offering $10,000 to anyone who
can capture them, dead or alive.

821
01:00:51,751 --> 01:00:55,631
Oh,... alive.
They should be alive.

822
01:00:57,792 --> 01:01:02,332
They are fighting for freedom.
And we believe in freedom in NZ.

823
01:01:02,376 --> 01:01:04,536
It is a marvellous thing.

824
01:01:09,709 --> 01:01:13,249
Oi! Ricky! Freeze!

825
01:01:13,334 --> 01:01:17,004
OK, OK. OK, Ricky.
Stay there we're coming over to you.

826
01:01:17,417 --> 01:01:18,827
Come on.

827
01:01:18,876 --> 01:01:22,036
It's too steep. It's too steep.
Ricky, you come across here.

828
01:01:22,084 --> 01:01:22,834
No.

829
01:01:22,835 --> 01:01:26,254
Just slide down the bank, cross this
stream, and then climb up to us.

830
01:01:26,292 --> 01:01:27,922
- C'mon Ricky.
- You're absolutely safe.

831
01:01:27,959 --> 01:01:30,329
All you have to do is grab some
branches or some roots. OK?

832
01:01:30,376 --> 01:01:30,956
No!

833
01:01:31,001 --> 01:01:32,960
Ricky. Come over here right now!

834
01:01:32,961 --> 01:01:35,629
I'm not going back.
I'm not going to juvie.

835
01:01:35,667 --> 01:01:38,247
You are playing with a
bag of snakes, boy.

836
01:01:38,292 --> 01:01:40,582
A big bag with a lot
of holes in it.

837
01:01:40,584 --> 01:01:42,584
You've got the whole
country looking for you.

838
01:01:42,626 --> 01:01:43,876
I'll never stop running.

839
01:01:43,917 --> 01:01:47,247
Yeah, and I'll never stop chasing you.
I'm relentless. I'm like the Terminator.

840
01:01:47,251 --> 01:01:48,750
I'm more like
Terminator than you.

841
01:01:48,751 --> 01:01:50,791
I said it first. You're
more like Sarah Connor.

842
01:01:50,834 --> 01:01:51,504
No I'm not!

843
01:01:51,542 --> 01:01:55,502
Yes. And in the first movie too,
before she could do chin-ups.

844
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:59,166
It doesn't have to be
this difficult, Ricky. Yeah?

845
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:02,377
You're cold, you're damp...
and hungry.

846
01:02:03,834 --> 01:02:06,214
Look at that... scroggin.

847
01:02:06,334 --> 01:02:08,834
Got some nuts and dried fruit...

848
01:02:09,626 --> 01:02:12,826
Little pieces of chocolate.
Yum. Delicious.

849
01:02:12,959 --> 01:02:14,668
We could cut a deal;
make a trade.

850
01:02:14,669 --> 01:02:15,827
What kind of deal?

851
01:02:16,959 --> 01:02:18,629
The old man.

852
01:02:19,709 --> 01:02:22,329
You say that he made you do it,
let him take the rap,

853
01:02:22,376 --> 01:02:24,746
and I'll make sure you
never go back to juvie.

854
01:02:25,626 --> 01:02:29,246
We'll find you a new
foster home; a new Bella.

855
01:02:29,917 --> 01:02:32,077
- No deal.
- Oh, come on, Sarah Connor.

856
01:02:32,084 --> 01:02:33,291
Don't be a fool.

857
01:02:33,292 --> 01:02:35,382
You don't trade
family for anything.

858
01:02:35,417 --> 01:02:37,207
Well, you just keep running.

859
01:02:37,626 --> 01:02:40,576
He's here! He's here.
We got him!

860
01:02:40,626 --> 01:02:42,576
Go! Go! Go!

861
01:03:08,292 --> 01:03:12,882
OK. So you ate a sausage, she sang
a song, and you went to sleep.

862
01:03:14,042 --> 01:03:17,712
What? It was a relaxing song...
and a relaxing sausage.

863
01:03:20,417 --> 01:03:24,577
Do you think we've walked a thousand
miles yet? Like the wildebeest?

864
01:03:24,959 --> 01:03:26,039
Well, it feels like it, eh?

865
01:03:26,334 --> 01:03:31,254
Yeah. Always on the move,
always on the lookout for hunters,

866
01:03:31,501 --> 01:03:36,501
just like the wildebeest,
except humans.

867
01:03:36,876 --> 01:03:39,666
We're... Wilderpeople.

868
01:03:40,084 --> 01:03:41,424
Yeah, that's us.

869
01:03:41,459 --> 01:03:45,875
OK then, Wilderboy, let's
find somewhere to eat, shall we?

870
01:03:45,876 --> 01:03:46,996
There they are!

871
01:03:47,042 --> 01:03:48,832
Freeze!

872
01:03:49,751 --> 01:03:52,711
Shit just got real. Again.

873
01:03:53,001 --> 01:03:54,381
Now, drop your weapons.

874
01:03:54,667 --> 01:03:56,667
- We're not holding any weapons...
- Drop 'em!

875
01:03:58,001 --> 01:03:59,631
Go see what they got, Ricky.

876
01:04:04,084 --> 01:04:05,714
Baked beans,

877
01:04:06,084 --> 01:04:07,674
spaghetti,

878
01:04:08,084 --> 01:04:10,384
ba... baba... What?

879
01:04:10,417 --> 01:04:11,957
Oh, baba ganoush.

880
01:04:12,376 --> 01:04:13,126
What?

881
01:04:13,167 --> 01:04:14,537
Baba ganoush.

882
01:04:16,417 --> 01:04:17,037
What?

883
01:04:17,084 --> 01:04:18,884
Binoculars,

884
01:04:19,126 --> 01:04:21,916
rope, gaffer tape.

885
01:04:25,751 --> 01:04:27,331
Get their guns, Ricky.

886
01:04:27,751 --> 01:04:29,251
Give me your guns.

887
01:04:31,251 --> 01:04:32,711
Take the bolts out.

888
01:04:33,876 --> 01:04:35,996
There's a reward
for your capture.

889
01:04:36,584 --> 01:04:37,634
How much?

890
01:04:38,084 --> 01:04:39,084
10 grand.

891
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:41,422
Tell us when it gets to 20.

892
01:04:45,334 --> 01:04:49,134
And when they ask who did this,
tell them it was the Wilderpeople.

893
01:04:49,167 --> 01:04:50,627
The What-er-people?

894
01:04:52,334 --> 01:04:54,214
The Wilderpeople.

895
01:05:10,709 --> 01:05:14,709
No, I can't go back there. It wasn't my
farm; you know that. It was Bella's.

896
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:18,831
She ran the show. I could do stuff... me
and the dog... but she was the farmer.

897
01:05:18,834 --> 01:05:20,214
And the cook.

898
01:05:20,251 --> 01:05:21,751
Yeah, a bloody good cook too.

899
01:05:22,959 --> 01:05:27,879
But you... you can't keep on the run forever.
You've got to go back to society, you know that.

900
01:05:28,209 --> 01:05:31,459
I'm a menace to society.
Anyway, if I ever went back,

901
01:05:31,501 --> 01:05:34,131
I'd probably end up driving
a steamroller or something.

902
01:05:34,167 --> 01:05:36,287
That's what happens
to gangsters.

903
01:05:36,334 --> 01:05:39,227
Well, there's nothing wrong with that,
but if you're better at something else,

904
01:05:39,251 --> 01:05:40,977
then you should probably
give that a go, shouldn't you?

905
01:05:41,001 --> 01:05:43,081
Yeah, but I'm better
at being a gangster.

906
01:05:43,126 --> 01:05:44,456
You're not a bloody gangster.

907
01:05:44,501 --> 01:05:45,501
How would you know?

908
01:05:45,542 --> 01:05:49,082
Because I've known real gangsters, and
they're a lot tougher than you are.

909
01:05:49,126 --> 01:05:51,166
Yeah, but were they
skux, though?

910
01:05:51,167 --> 01:05:53,207
Skux? What the
hell does that mean?

911
01:05:53,251 --> 01:05:55,711
You know,... skux.

912
01:05:55,959 --> 01:05:57,709
Yeah, but what does it mean?

913
01:05:57,751 --> 01:06:04,711
Everything. It's cool, spunky, brainy,
good-looking, you know, gangster.

914
01:06:04,751 --> 01:06:08,291
Oh, for God's sake.
You're not a bloody gangster!

915
01:06:10,126 --> 01:06:11,126
Oh, jeez.

916
01:06:11,876 --> 01:06:13,376
Zag! Tupac!
Get back, Zag!

917
01:06:13,417 --> 01:06:15,666
Get back!
Come back here, you...!

918
01:06:15,667 --> 01:06:17,997
Get in behind!
Get in behind, Zag!

919
01:06:18,042 --> 01:06:19,042
Zag!

920
01:06:23,959 --> 01:06:24,959
Zag!

921
01:06:25,667 --> 01:06:27,377
Get out of it, you mongrel!

922
01:06:30,834 --> 01:06:32,504
Shit.

923
01:06:49,834 --> 01:06:50,834
Uncle!

924
01:07:44,251 --> 01:07:47,291
What have you done?

925
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:57,751
Oh jeez.

926
01:08:05,417 --> 01:08:07,497
Give us your gun, mate.
Hm?

927
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:08,964
Go on, get out.
No, Uncle.

928
01:08:09,042 --> 01:08:10,502
Get out of...
Uncle! Get out of here,

929
01:08:10,542 --> 01:08:12,582
Ricky.
Go on, get out.

930
01:08:12,667 --> 01:08:14,457
But can't we just...?
Go!

931
01:08:41,959 --> 01:08:43,039
What does that say?

932
01:08:43,084 --> 01:08:44,174
Zag.

933
01:08:45,834 --> 01:08:47,294
Good.

934
01:10:09,167 --> 01:10:11,747
So, she's been with us
the whole time, eh?

935
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:13,542
Yeah.

936
01:10:13,959 --> 01:10:17,829
Well, pretty close
to the sky up here.

937
01:10:20,126 --> 01:10:22,456

Those idiots are worse in
the bush than you are.

960
01:12:34,292 --> 01:12:37,082
Useless. Couldn't find
a clown in a circus.

961
01:12:37,126 --> 01:12:38,536
Stop!
This is the police!

962
01:12:38,584 --> 01:12:39,584
Oh shit!

963
01:13:09,709 --> 01:13:11,329
What?

964
01:13:23,209 --> 01:13:26,079
I was trying to tell you it
was like The Lord of the Rings.

965
01:13:52,417 --> 01:13:53,457
What the...?

966
01:13:55,584 --> 01:13:57,424
Can you see
that bush over there?

967
01:13:58,042 --> 01:13:59,422
Yeah.

968
01:14:03,501 --> 01:14:05,581
Is it a man or a bush?

969
01:14:07,501 --> 01:14:08,751
Bush!

970
01:14:10,251 --> 01:14:12,251
Man!

971
01:14:12,459 --> 01:14:16,289
Bushman!

972
01:14:17,959 --> 01:14:19,709
Ah!

973
01:14:20,501 --> 01:14:23,581
Hello. I was hoping
to run into you two.

974
01:14:23,626 --> 01:14:27,076
Well, if you're after the reward, you
can bugger off. We're dangerous.

975
01:14:27,126 --> 01:14:28,826
Yeah, we're dangerous.

976
01:14:28,834 --> 01:14:32,333
Yeah, no. I heard about that.
Don't worry. I'm not going to capture you.

977
01:14:32,334 --> 01:14:34,714
You guys heard of
a... a local legend

978
01:14:34,751 --> 01:14:38,461
about a guy who lives out
here in the bush on this own?

979
01:14:38,584 --> 01:14:41,544
They call him Psycho Sam!

980
01:14:44,376 --> 01:14:45,376
No.

981
01:14:45,417 --> 01:14:48,207
No? Oh, OK.

982
01:14:49,001 --> 01:14:50,751
Well, my name is Sam, anyway.

983
01:14:51,501 --> 01:14:56,421
I'm a friend!
Come on.

984
01:15:10,334 --> 01:15:11,834
Bikkie?

985
01:15:20,751 --> 01:15:24,461
Why do you reckon
he calls himself Psycho Sam?

986
01:15:25,834 --> 01:15:29,544
Here you go. Put these on. Stop
the Government from tracking you.

987
01:15:30,167 --> 01:15:31,377
Never mind

988
01:15:31,417 --> 01:15:34,377
That fulla you saved... he was a ranger.
Diabetic.

989
01:15:34,417 --> 01:15:36,417
You got a little support over that.

990
01:15:36,459 --> 01:15:38,977
But then you robbed those hunters,
so you're back in the negatives again.

991
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:41,881
Well, that was... this fella.
He's the maniac.

992
01:15:41,917 --> 01:15:44,707
Well, they're still saying you're
dangerous. And a bit of a pervert.

993
01:15:44,751 --> 01:15:45,581
God damn it!

994
01:15:45,626 --> 01:15:49,626
It's all right. You can stay here as long as
you like. I've been up here 15 years now.

995
01:15:49,917 --> 01:15:51,167
Got everything I need.

996
01:15:51,501 --> 01:15:52,921
How long they been chasing ya?

997
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:54,669
I don't know.
About five months now?

998
01:15:54,709 --> 01:15:55,669
Bastards!

999
01:15:55,709 --> 01:15:59,477
That's the typical government. Always trying to
step on the little guy just for living his life.

1000
01:15:59,501 --> 01:16:00,751
It never stops either.

1001
01:16:00,792 --> 01:16:02,422
That's why I can't go back.

1002
01:16:02,709 --> 01:16:04,129
Not going to be part
of the machine.

1003
01:16:04,130 --> 01:16:05,286
Form fillers.

1004
01:16:05,501 --> 01:16:06,711
Form fillers?

1005
01:16:07,834 --> 01:16:09,166
That's how they get you.

1006
01:16:09,167 --> 01:16:11,537
Anything you want to do in life,
you got to fill out a form.

1007
01:16:11,584 --> 01:16:13,084
And they've got forms
for everything.

1008
01:16:13,126 --> 01:16:14,706
You fill it out,
it goes upstairs,

1009
01:16:14,751 --> 01:16:16,209
and then they make you
fill out a new form,

1010
01:16:16,210 --> 01:16:18,477
just to confirm it was you
that filled out the first form.

1011
01:16:18,501 --> 01:16:20,041
And if ever you want to
stop filling out forms,

1012
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:23,002
well, there's about five
different forms for that.

1013
01:16:23,542 --> 01:16:26,502
Don't even get me started
on the national rugby team.

1014
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:28,631
They're not human.

1015
01:16:43,626 --> 01:16:45,286
What you doing, mate?

1016
01:16:46,667 --> 01:16:47,667
Writing.

1017
01:16:48,334 --> 01:16:50,544
And what are you writing,
Mr Shakespeare?

1018
01:16:52,209 --> 01:16:53,329
Haiku.

1019
01:16:54,459 --> 01:16:56,829
Well, go on, read it out.
I'll tell you if it's any good.

1020
01:16:57,501 --> 01:16:59,331
No, it's just a personal one.

1021
01:16:59,626 --> 01:17:01,626
Oh, come on. Don't be shy.

1022
01:17:02,209 --> 01:17:03,919
Mm, OK.

1023
01:17:06,126 --> 01:17:09,786
Trees, birds, rivers, sky.

1024
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:12,326
Running with my Uncle Hec.

1025
01:17:12,709 --> 01:17:14,379
Living forever.

1026
01:17:17,334 --> 01:17:19,424
See? Told you it was dumb.

1027
01:17:21,501 --> 01:17:24,081
No, no.

1028
01:17:24,126 --> 01:17:26,706
It was just that

1029
01:17:26,959 --> 01:17:28,129
Well, that's the...

1030
01:17:29,459 --> 01:17:33,329
That's the first time I've...
heard my name in a poem.

1031
01:17:33,834 --> 01:17:34,834
I liked it.

1032
01:17:38,876 --> 01:17:41,916
Gee, Bella would have loved
this adventure, wouldn't she?

1033
01:17:42,084 --> 01:17:45,674
Mm. Why couldn't you
guys have any kids?

1034
01:17:46,334 --> 01:17:49,134
Well, just couldn't.

1035
01:17:49,167 --> 01:17:52,497
Well, I couldn't.

1036
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:56,541
That's not very fair. Some
people can't even have babies.

1037
01:17:57,001 --> 01:18:00,421
And the ones who can...
they don't even want them.

1038
01:18:02,209 --> 01:18:03,709
Like my mum.

1039
01:18:04,334 --> 01:18:07,134
No, mate. She wanted you.
She was...

1040
01:18:07,167 --> 01:18:10,707
she was probably just young. She couldn't
work out how to raise you, you know.

1041
01:18:10,709 --> 01:18:12,539
I bet she loved you, though.

1042
01:18:13,126 --> 01:18:14,126
Doubt it.

1043
01:18:14,167 --> 01:18:16,327
Well, you never know.

1044
01:18:16,376 --> 01:18:18,496
You're pretty likeable.

1045
01:18:26,667 --> 01:18:28,247
Lights out, OK?

1046
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:29,957
Goodnight, Sam.

1047
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:35,289
Oh, I haven't got
that fixed yet.

1048
01:18:35,334 --> 01:18:36,584
Goodnight, Uncle.

1049
01:18:36,917 --> 01:18:38,417
Goodnight, mate.

1050
01:19:14,709 --> 01:19:15,879
Uncle!

1051
01:19:19,917 --> 01:19:26,497
Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle!
Uncle! Uncle! Uncle, we have to go!

1052
01:19:26,542 --> 01:19:29,750
Yeah. Even I can't stand
his cooking anymore.

1053
01:19:29,751 --> 01:19:31,268
We'll get out off first
thing in the morning, eh?

1054
01:19:31,292 --> 01:19:32,542
No! They're here.

1055
01:19:32,584 --> 01:19:35,625
Government! Government!
Sorry, excuse me.

1056
01:19:35,626 --> 01:19:36,376
Did they see you?

1057
01:19:36,417 --> 01:19:37,747
No, but they're close!

1058
01:19:37,792 --> 01:19:39,208
OK. Get our stuff!

1059
01:19:39,209 --> 01:19:41,539
Hey! Hey, what happened
to my phone?

1060
01:19:41,584 --> 01:19:43,794
I upgraded it for ya.
You're on four bars now.

1061
01:19:43,834 --> 01:19:45,634
You clown. What have you done?

1062
01:19:45,876 --> 01:19:47,435
Come out and give over
the boy, Mr Faulkner.

1063
01:19:47,459 --> 01:19:48,999
Uncle! Uncle! They're close.

1064
01:19:49,001 --> 01:19:52,381
Sam, what's the fastest
way out of here?

1065
01:19:52,792 --> 01:19:54,882
- Jet pack!
- Do you actually have a jet pack?

1066
01:19:54,917 --> 01:19:55,917
No. What?

1067
01:19:56,376 --> 01:19:59,666
Wait! I've got an
underground bunker.

1068
01:19:59,751 --> 01:20:02,711
This tunnel leads directly
to an underground chamb...

1069
01:20:03,209 --> 01:20:04,418
I haven't dug it yet. Oh!

1070
01:20:04,419 --> 01:20:06,667
What have I been
doing with my life?

1071
01:20:06,834 --> 01:20:10,834
That's it. We've run out of options.
Just pretend to be dead. I'll be here.

1072
01:20:12,626 --> 01:20:14,956
Come on, guys. It only
works if we all do it.

1073
01:20:15,001 --> 01:20:17,631
For Christ's sake, Sam,
pull yourself together.

1074
01:20:17,709 --> 01:20:20,539
We need to get out of here right now.
What are we gonna do?

1075
01:20:21,834 --> 01:20:23,714
- Crumpy!
- What?

1076
01:20:23,751 --> 01:20:24,751
Crumpy will take you!

1077
01:20:24,792 --> 01:20:26,172
Who the hell is Crumpy?!

1078
01:20:31,001 --> 01:20:31,791
Crumpy!

1079
01:20:31,834 --> 01:20:33,458
Jesus, does she even go?

1080
01:20:33,459 --> 01:20:36,459
Crumpy. Unkillable.
Four-wheel drive.

1081
01:20:36,584 --> 01:20:38,634
Both wheels go...
go four-wheel-drive.

1082
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:39,537
Ricky, where are ya?

1083
01:20:39,584 --> 01:20:41,674
Oh, where did I put the keys?

1084
01:20:43,626 --> 01:20:44,706
Unkillable!

1085
01:20:44,709 --> 01:20:45,459
Get in!

1086
01:20:45,501 --> 01:20:47,251
Ricky Baker, you are
not driving this ute.

1087
01:20:47,292 --> 01:20:49,252
Get in the car!

1088
01:20:50,042 --> 01:20:51,922
Oh shit.

1089
01:20:53,376 --> 01:20:54,706
Tupac!

1090
01:20:55,751 --> 01:20:58,791
OK. I'll hold up the government
and buy you some time.

1091
01:20:58,834 --> 01:21:01,004
Thanks, mate.
Don't do anything stupid.

1092
01:21:01,042 --> 01:21:04,252
Me?

1093
01:21:06,751 --> 01:21:08,171
How did you get
this thing started?

1094
01:21:08,209 --> 01:21:09,209
The knack.

1095
01:21:14,626 --> 01:21:15,666
Crumpy!

1096
01:21:25,001 --> 01:21:27,461
Hey! Sorry, mate. She's a
bit bumpy around here.

1097
01:21:27,501 --> 01:21:29,711
Not too fast, Ricky. Slow down.

1098
01:21:31,834 --> 01:21:34,794
No! No!

1099
01:21:36,001 --> 01:21:37,041
Tree!

1100
01:21:37,084 --> 01:21:38,044
Get off!

1101
01:21:38,045 --> 01:21:41,002
Slow down!

1102
01:21:46,667 --> 01:21:47,707
That's my bike.

1103
01:21:47,751 --> 01:21:49,001
Shut up, they're mine.

1104
01:22:00,709 --> 01:22:01,709
Whoa.

1105
01:22:01,751 --> 01:22:03,381
Uh-oh.

1106
01:22:04,042 --> 01:22:06,042
May as well play it to the end.
What do you reckon?

1107
01:22:06,209 --> 01:22:10,919
You mean have a shoot out, and then when we've
got no bullets, run out and say, 'Freedom!'

1108
01:22:10,959 --> 01:22:12,829
And then die in
a blaze of glory?

1109
01:22:13,167 --> 01:22:15,917
No. I actually meant
till we run out of petrol.

1110
01:22:16,084 --> 01:22:18,794
Oh. Well, I'm dying
in a blaze of glory.

1111
01:22:18,834 --> 01:22:21,254
No!

1112
01:22:28,959 --> 01:22:32,579
Oh.

1113
01:23:29,459 --> 01:23:30,459
Whoa.

1114
01:23:31,584 --> 01:23:36,674
Faulkner! This is the Police.
Stop the vehicle and hand over the boy.

1115
01:23:36,751 --> 01:23:40,291
You're pretty much
surrounded. No escape.

1116
01:23:41,042 --> 01:23:42,042
Come on mate.

1117
01:23:42,834 --> 01:23:44,754
Mr Faulkner... Mr Faulk...

1118
01:23:45,751 --> 01:23:48,461
Pull the bloody vehicle
over, Faulkner.

1119
01:23:48,501 --> 01:23:49,711
Ricky Baker!

1120
01:23:49,751 --> 01:23:54,919
You pull that ute over right now or you're
going to be in a whole lot of trouble, son!

1121
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:57,457
You don't even have
your full licence!

1122
01:24:01,251 --> 01:24:02,631
Ricky!

1123
01:24:08,251 --> 01:24:09,421
Is that what I think it is?

1124
01:24:09,459 --> 01:24:14,419
Uncle Hec! Uncle Hec, that's the actual army.
This is like an actual war, like, for real!

1125
01:25:07,834 --> 01:25:09,384
Roger, Comms, we have visual.

1126
01:25:09,751 --> 01:25:14,631
Kilo, Foxtrot. We've
lost them in the bush.

1127
01:25:18,251 --> 01:25:23,041
OK. Stop the truck, Ricky. I just...
stop the truck. I want to get out now.

1128
01:25:23,042 --> 01:25:26,462
I didn't choose the skux life;
the skux life chose me.

1129
01:25:26,501 --> 01:25:27,711
Ricky, stop.

1130
01:25:27,751 --> 01:25:29,461
Stop!

1131
01:25:29,501 --> 01:25:31,751
Freedom!

1132
01:26:05,501 --> 01:26:07,291
How many bullets do we have?

1133
01:26:07,417 --> 01:26:08,877
Ricky, we've got to stop.

1134
01:26:08,917 --> 01:26:11,207
Never! Come on! Mate, this is it for me.

1135
01:26:11,251 --> 01:26:16,211
Look... I can't go on anymore. My leg is
buggered. I can hardly see.

1136
01:26:16,334 --> 01:26:17,424
This is the end.

1137
01:26:30,876 --> 01:26:33,496
Ricky Baker, you get out
here this instant, son.

1138
01:26:33,542 --> 01:26:36,332
You've caused a lot of damage
to private property today.

1139
01:26:36,334 --> 01:26:38,674
You've taken out this
corrugated iron fence.

1140
01:26:38,792 --> 01:26:41,042
Not cool, not cheap.

1141
01:26:44,209 --> 01:26:47,499
Ricky, this isn't a game.
That's real over there.

1142
01:26:47,542 --> 01:26:50,542
They're never gonna stop
chasing, ever. We're done.

1143
01:26:50,584 --> 01:26:52,794
I'm not going back!

1144
01:26:52,834 --> 01:26:55,384
Listen, it's over.

1145
01:26:55,417 --> 01:26:56,417
Traitor!

1146
01:26:57,751 --> 01:27:01,081
Give me your gun! Give me it!
Oi, you! Give me your gun.

1147
01:27:01,126 --> 01:27:03,326
It's been booked.
It's in Wellington.

1148
01:27:03,376 --> 01:27:04,956
Oh for God's sake!

1149
01:27:05,126 --> 01:27:06,376
It wasn't me!

1150
01:27:07,126 --> 01:27:09,956
You idiot, what did I tell
you about gun responsibility?

1151
01:27:10,751 --> 01:27:12,581
That's it. I'm giving you up.

1152
01:27:12,626 --> 01:27:14,206
We give up!

1153
01:27:15,501 --> 01:27:17,131
We give up!

1154
01:27:17,792 --> 01:27:20,125
He's molestering me!

1155
01:27:20,126 --> 01:27:21,286
I knew it.

1156
01:27:23,001 --> 01:27:24,500
You little bastard!

1157
01:27:24,501 --> 01:27:26,211
He's a molesterer!

1158
01:27:26,292 --> 01:27:30,792
I'm not! He's lying!
I'm not a molesterer!

1159
01:27:31,667 --> 01:27:33,127
I bloody hate you.

1160
01:27:33,167 --> 01:27:34,957
I hate you too, traitor!

1161
01:27:35,042 --> 01:27:39,382
That's it. You're on your own.

1162
01:27:39,751 --> 01:27:41,711
Don't shoot!

1163
01:27:53,167 --> 01:27:55,167
Don't you take another step.

1164
01:27:58,001 --> 01:27:59,421
What do you think you're doing?

1165
01:27:59,459 --> 01:28:01,499
What do you think
he's doing, Andy?

1166
01:28:02,959 --> 01:28:03,669
Andy?

1167
01:28:03,709 --> 01:28:06,629
You're not going anywhere.
We stick together!

1168
01:28:06,709 --> 01:28:08,499
What, are you gonna shoot me?

1169
01:28:09,334 --> 01:28:11,541
Do it.

1170
01:28:11,542 --> 01:28:13,172
We're family!

1171
01:28:13,459 --> 01:28:15,209
Like hell.

1172
01:28:15,542 --> 01:28:16,922
Go ahead. Shoot me.

1173
01:28:16,959 --> 01:28:19,829
Got you now, perv.

1174
01:28:22,209 --> 01:28:23,209
Oh!

1175
01:28:23,251 --> 01:28:25,631
You shot me!
I'm... I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

1176
01:28:25,667 --> 01:28:26,667
It was an accident!

1177
01:28:30,376 --> 01:28:32,626
I've got him! I've
got the package!

1178
01:28:33,209 --> 01:28:34,669
Well done, everybody!

1179
01:28:34,709 --> 01:28:37,249
Now let's get this precious
child out of here!

1180
01:28:37,251 --> 01:28:40,631
I'm sorry, Uncle. No!
I'm not your bloody uncle.

1181
01:28:40,667 --> 01:28:43,916
I didn't mean to!
Hector Faulkner, you are under arrest.

1182
01:28:43,917 --> 01:28:48,827
Whatever you do or say will be used
against you in a court of law!

1183
01:28:48,876 --> 01:28:49,876
Paula!

1184
01:28:50,876 --> 01:28:54,456
Police in NZ don't really say that.
That's like an American thing.

1185
01:28:54,459 --> 01:28:55,829
And you're not a cop.

1186
01:28:56,751 --> 01:28:57,881
It's over.

1187
01:29:14,751 --> 01:29:16,881
Get in.

1188
01:29:16,917 --> 01:29:19,207
Oh!

1189
01:29:58,251 --> 01:30:03,500
Yeah, I found him on my horse,
and we had some sausages...

1190
01:30:03,501 --> 01:30:06,419
Uh, I'm a big fan and, uh,
managed to scab me a selfie.

1191
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:09,827
I said that I was the Terminator and he was
in fact Sarah Connor.

1192
01:30:09,876 --> 01:30:13,576
I said, 'I didn't choose the skux life,
uh, the skux life chose me.'

1193
01:30:13,626 --> 01:30:16,496
Who is going to give him that
upbringing? Is it perhaps...?

1194
01:30:16,542 --> 01:30:18,922
We just want what's best
for the child, Your Honour.

1195

Ca-caw, Hec!

1202
01:32:13,167 --> 01:32:14,327
Hi.

1203
01:32:19,709 --> 01:32:22,829
How was jail?
Did you shank anyone?

1204
01:32:27,251 --> 01:32:28,251
I'm sorry.

1205
01:32:29,334 --> 01:32:31,714
I'm sorry that I shot you,...

1206
01:32:32,417 --> 01:32:34,457
and I'm sorry that
I burnt down your shed.

1207
01:32:34,501 --> 01:32:35,041
That's enough.

1208
01:32:35,084 --> 01:32:38,416
And I'm sorry for what I said that day,
about you being a molesterer.

1209
01:32:38,417 --> 01:32:40,327
That really is enough;
I'm getting uncomfortable.

1210
01:32:40,334 --> 01:32:44,544
I just got carried away being
an outlaw; had too much fun.

1211
01:32:52,126 --> 01:32:53,416
Been doing all right?

1212
01:32:53,667 --> 01:32:57,327
Yeah, I just had to stick it out
in a new family for a year.

1213
01:32:57,334 --> 01:33:00,794
I did.
You'll like them.

1214
01:33:02,042 --> 01:33:06,582
Man, you'd love it there. There's heaps
of room, they need some help on the farm,

1215
01:33:06,667 --> 01:33:08,627
it's right next to the bush...

1216
01:33:08,709 --> 01:33:11,709
Oh, and I also saved
up and got this.

1217
01:33:12,417 --> 01:33:14,127
You want to find that bird?

1218
01:33:14,167 --> 01:33:15,627
Yeah. We'll be famous.

1219
01:33:15,876 --> 01:33:18,956
Nah, you're
better off without me, mate.

1220
01:33:19,001 --> 01:33:20,581
Yeah. But I...

1221
01:33:20,626 --> 01:33:23,036
I just thought that...

1222
01:33:27,667 --> 01:33:29,207
OK.

1223
01:33:30,084 --> 01:33:31,884
Sorry.

1224
01:33:39,626 --> 01:33:41,956
Hey. Wait on.

1225
01:33:44,501 --> 01:33:47,131
I've got something to say.

1226
01:33:48,834 --> 01:33:51,964
Me and this fat kid...

1227
01:33:53,001 --> 01:33:59,171
We ran, we ate, and read books.

1228
01:33:59,417 --> 01:34:02,917
And it was the best.

1229
01:34:09,251 --> 01:34:11,041
It was the best.

1230
01:34:13,584 --> 01:34:15,384
Yeah.

1231
01:34:15,876 --> 01:34:20,036
Look, to tell you the truth,

1232
01:34:20,501 --> 01:34:23,331
I can't stand it here.
It's full of old people.

1233
01:34:24,917 --> 01:34:27,707
So... you're coming?

1234
01:34:29,709 --> 01:34:32,209
Yeah. Yeah, I'm coming.

1235
01:34:32,959 --> 01:34:36,749
Wouldn't want a little twerp like you to
get all the credit for finding a bird.

1236
01:34:37,751 --> 01:34:39,501
Yeah, but I've got one rule...

1237
01:34:40,001 --> 01:34:41,751
you got to let
me call you 'Uncle'.

1238
01:34:43,626 --> 01:34:44,876
Uncle?

1239
01:34:47,292 --> 01:34:49,332
Yeah, I can stand that.

1240
01:34:49,417 --> 01:34:51,127
I've got one rule too.

1241
01:34:52,376 --> 01:34:54,496
Not allowed to shoot me.

1242
01:35:06,334 --> 01:35:10,674
OK, I'll... I'll go
and get my toothbrush.

1243
01:35:28,751 --> 01:35:31,211
Here we go. Reckon
you can handle it?

1244
01:35:31,251 --> 01:35:33,001
What do you think?

1245
01:35:34,167 --> 01:35:36,377
Reckon you can find that bird?

1246
01:35:36,751 --> 01:35:39,001
Yeah. I think
I know where it is.

1247
01:35:39,501 --> 01:35:42,631
Seem to remember it was a
pretty beautiful place, was it?

1248
01:35:43,751 --> 01:35:46,881
Yeah. Majestical.

1249
01:35:49,084 --> 01:35:51,134
Come on. Let's go.

1250
01:35:51,459 --> 01:35:53,079

Get in my way, I'll have
your guts for garters.

1253
01:35:59,209 --> 01:36:01,789
Well, I honestly don't know
what 'guts for garters' is, so...

1254
01:36:02,751 --> 01:36:04,000
Well, it's gangster talk.
