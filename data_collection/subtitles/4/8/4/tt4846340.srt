1
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,714
Fourteen.. Fifteen..

2
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:51,779
Sixteen. Prime.

3
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,951
Eighteen. Prime.

4
00:00:55,214 --> 00:00:56,365
Twenty.

5
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,327
Twenty-one.

6
00:00:59,124 --> 00:00:59,939
Twenty-two.

7
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,723
West Virginia Collegiate Institute is the
best school for Negros in the state.

8
00:01:04,687 --> 00:01:07,742
It's the only school, past the eighth
grade, anywhere near here.

9
00:01:08,761 --> 00:01:11,796
Isosceles. Scalene

10
00:01:12,115 --> 00:01:13,494
Equilateral

11
00:01:14,258 --> 00:01:15,333
Rhombus

12
00:01:15,797 --> 00:01:17,041
Trapezoid

13
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:19,116
Katherine's in the sixth grade.

14
00:01:19,264 --> 00:01:20,612
They want to take her early.

15
00:01:21,308 --> 00:01:22,560
Tetrahedron,

16
00:01:23,722 --> 00:01:24,949
Dodecahedron

17
00:01:25,574 --> 00:01:27,074
They're offering a full scholarship.

18
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,821
All you have to do is get there.

19
00:01:30,766 --> 00:01:32,001
Ms. Coleman.

20
00:01:32,911 --> 00:01:35,574
Why don't you solve the equation
on the board?

21
00:01:42,994 --> 00:01:45,453
We took up a collection amongst the
teachers and such,

22
00:01:45,648 --> 00:01:47,061
It's not a lot.

23
00:01:47,404 --> 00:01:49,331
But it's enough to help get you
settle down

24
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:52,494
That's more than kind, Ms. Sumner.

25
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:06,210
If the product of two terms is zero,

26
00:02:07,212 --> 00:02:09,272
then common sense says at least
one of the two terms

27
00:02:09,278 --> 00:02:10,633
has to be zero to start with

28
00:02:11,475 --> 00:02:13,967
So, if you move all the terms over
to one side,

29
00:02:14,369 --> 00:02:17,256
you'd put the quadratics into a form
that can be factored,

30
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:20,620
Allowing that side of the equation
to equal zero.

31
00:02:21,764 --> 00:02:24,505
Once you've done that,
it's pretty straight forward from there

32
00:02:27,429 --> 00:02:29,448
In all my years of teaching,

33
00:02:29,828 --> 00:02:32,280
I've never seen a mind like
the one your daughter has.

34
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,750
- Katherine!
- Hurry on now, love

35
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,690
You have to go.

36
00:02:39,314 --> 00:02:40,914
Let Mommy take you in.

37
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,029
You have to see what she becomes.

38
00:03:16,117 --> 00:03:17,531
Ok, try to turn it over, now!

39
00:03:19,055 --> 00:03:20,816
Katherine?

40
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,605
Mary!

41
00:03:22,606 --> 00:03:23,932
Somebody!

42
00:03:23,933 --> 00:03:27,145
Katherine! Quit staring off into space
and turn the damn car over

43
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,076
I got it.

44
00:03:30,093 --> 00:03:31,238
I'm not deaf

45
00:03:31,303 --> 00:03:33,403
I wonder some times.

46
00:03:34,228 --> 00:03:35,670
Here it goes.

47
00:03:37,935 --> 00:03:39,669
Yeah, it's the starter.

48
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,977
That is definitely the starter.

49
00:03:43,007 --> 00:03:44,690
The starter's startin' to make us late.

50
00:03:45,407 --> 00:03:49,192
We all go end up unemployed driving around
in this pile of junk to work everyday.

51
00:03:49,216 --> 00:03:51,234
You're welcome to walk the 16 miles.

52
00:03:51,247 --> 00:03:52,464
Or sit on the back of the bus.

53
00:03:54,294 --> 00:03:56,262
I won't do neither.

54
00:03:56,786 --> 00:03:58,386
I'll hitchhike.

55
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,206
Girls,

56
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,198
No crime in a broken down car.

57
00:04:11,223 --> 00:04:13,310
No crime being Negro neither.

58
00:04:13,341 --> 00:04:17,450
Button it up, Mary! Nobody wants to
go to jail behind your mouth.

59
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,129
I'll do my best, sugar.

60
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,851
Not a great place for the three of
ya'll to be havin' car trouble.

61
00:04:35,161 --> 00:04:37,652
We didn't pick the place, Officer.
It picked us.

62
00:04:37,976 --> 00:04:39,676
You bein' disrespectful?

63
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,051
No, sir.

64
00:04:41,052 --> 00:04:43,508
- You have identification on ya?
- Yes, sir.

65
00:04:43,532 --> 00:04:45,532
Yes, sir.

66
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,860
We're just on our way to work.

67
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,423
At Langley.

68
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:51,862
NASA, sir.

69
00:04:51,887 --> 00:04:53,390
We do a great deal of the calculating

70
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,367
Getting our rockets into space.

71
00:04:55,761 --> 00:04:57,118
- All three?
- Yes, sir.

72
00:04:57,423 --> 00:04:58,447
Yes, officer.

73
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:02,403
NASA, that's somethin'

74
00:05:03,207 --> 00:05:04,828
I had no idea they hired...

75
00:05:05,582 --> 00:05:07,062
There're quite a few women,

76
00:05:07,633 --> 00:05:09,141
working in the Space Program.

77
00:05:18,168 --> 00:05:20,100
Damn Russians are watching us right now.

78
00:05:20,824 --> 00:05:22,545
Sputniks.

79
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:25,219
You girls ever meet those Astronauts?

80
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,596
The Mercury 7?

81
00:05:27,234 --> 00:05:28,467
Absolutely

82
00:05:29,292 --> 00:05:32,905
Yes, sir.
We work with those gentlemen all the time.

83
00:05:32,929 --> 00:05:34,278
Those boys are the best we got.

84
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:36,203
- I'm sure of that
- Yeah

85
00:05:36,228 --> 00:05:38,450
We gotta get a man up there
before the Commies do.

86
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:39,555
- Yes!
- Absolutely.

87
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:41,151
Whole damn country's counting on ‘em.

88
00:05:41,152 --> 00:05:42,384
That's for certain

89
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:45,240
Hard to be of service broken down on
the side of the road, though.

90
00:05:46,011 --> 00:05:47,138
Right! Right!

91
00:05:47,824 --> 00:05:49,650
Well, you need a tow or somethin'?

92
00:05:49,651 --> 00:05:52,257
No, thank you, Officer.
I think I got it, Just give me that..

93
00:05:52,634 --> 00:05:53,689
Just need to

94
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,703
bypass the starter

95
00:05:58,261 --> 00:05:59,640
She is good at this stuff

96
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:04,160
That a girl

97
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:05,225
We're all set.

98
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,642
Hell. Least I can do is give ya
an escort.

99
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,570
Imagine ya'll are
running late to work.

100
00:06:09,595 --> 00:06:11,305
Oh, no sir! We wouldn't
want to bother you.

101
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,329
That would be wonderful, Officer.

102
00:06:13,935 --> 00:06:15,145
Thank you so much, sir.

103
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,159
- Follow me!
- I'm driving!

104
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,259
Hurry up, Dorothy!
Before he changes his mind!

105
00:06:19,283 --> 00:06:20,659
- We're coming!
- Hold your horses!

106
00:06:28,195 --> 00:06:29,055
Yes!

107
00:06:29,065 --> 00:06:32,170
- Mary! Slow down! You're so close!
- Well, be quiet. He said to follow him!

108
00:06:32,194 --> 00:06:33,799
He didn't mean you hit him behind!

109
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,135
Dear Lord..
I don't even know where to begin!

110
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,705
Oh! I'll tell you where to begin!

111
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,945
Three negro women are chasing
a white police officer

112
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,600
down the highway in Hampton, Virginia

113
00:06:45,245 --> 00:06:47,070
1961.

114
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,700
Ladies, that there is
a God ordained miracle!

115
00:06:51,855 --> 00:06:56,485
Starting tomorrow,
I'm riding the bus

116
00:07:19,548 --> 00:07:21,548
Show me

117
00:07:22,473 --> 00:07:24,483
No, exactly

118
00:07:31,152 --> 00:07:33,756
Ascent angle: 46.56.

119
00:07:33,856 --> 00:07:38,151
Approaching 7400 mph

120
00:07:38,251 --> 00:07:39,969
118 seconds.

121
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:51,338
Second stage. Success.

122
00:07:53,299 --> 00:07:56,727
Korabl-Sputnik-4 is orbital.

123
00:07:57,567 --> 00:07:59,252
Orbital entry is established.

124
00:07:59,945 --> 00:08:01,944
Russian orbital entry is established.

125
00:08:03,845 --> 00:08:04,944
Jim Webb.

126
00:08:06,345 --> 00:08:08,044
Yes, Mr. President

127
00:08:08,645 --> 00:08:10,675
We certainly are, sir.

128
00:08:11,305 --> 00:08:14,775
It looks like they've achieved at least
one orbit, maybe two

129
00:08:16,743 --> 00:08:21,643
Zvezdochka is ready to go again.
So is our comrade, Ivan.

130
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,510
A brave space traveler.

131
00:08:23,943 --> 00:08:26,743
We have proven life can be sustained
in space.

132
00:08:26,868 --> 00:08:28,768
Now, we will be first to send a human

133
00:08:28,793 --> 00:08:30,456
A damn dog!

134
00:08:30,637 --> 00:08:31,858
And a damn mannequin!

135
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:39,866
And then a 1.6 megaton
RDS-37 thermonuclear warhead

136
00:08:39,891 --> 00:08:42,297
drops down in the
middle of Des Moines.

137
00:08:42,436 --> 00:08:43,929
Well, that's a pretty big jump, sir.

138
00:08:43,953 --> 00:08:44,953
What?

139
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,799
- Just there's that..
- Who the hell is he?

140
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:49,708
Paul Stafford.
Our Lead Engineer, Mr. Webb.

141
00:08:49,717 --> 00:08:52,479
I think what he meant to say
is that speculation, at least

142
00:08:52,504 --> 00:08:55,114
on our side of the equation
by definition, can be..

143
00:08:55,843 --> 00:08:57,498
Just a little dangerous.

144
00:08:57,622 --> 00:08:58,713
Dangerous?

145
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:00,721
You know what's dangerous,
Mr. Stafford?

146
00:09:01,396 --> 00:09:03,298
Inaction, and indecision.

147
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:06,712
Russians have a spy
satellite lapping the planet,

148
00:09:06,737 --> 00:09:09,449
taking pictures
of God knows what!

149
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,931
The President is demanding
an immediate response.

150
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:15,465
No more delays.
Alan Shepard, John Glenn, your uncle Bob.

151
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,446
Doesn't matter,
just get us up there, Harrison

152
00:09:17,499 --> 00:09:18,921
We can't justify a space program

153
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:21,236
that doesn't put anything in space.

154
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,563
How did that feel in there, Paul?

155
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,735
Do you think you enlightened
the Administrator?

156
00:09:30,062 --> 00:09:31,593
No, he didn't look enlightened to me.

157
00:09:32,627 --> 00:09:35,627
- He look enlightened to you, Sam?
- Not particularly.

158
00:09:35,755 --> 00:09:38,380
And just so you know, he's not
wrong about what he said in there.

159
00:09:38,405 --> 00:09:39,479
You know that, right?

160
00:09:40,074 --> 00:09:42,543
Because now that they can get up there,
a bomb will follow.

161
00:09:43,524 --> 00:09:45,390
That's what happens to all our good ideas.

162
00:09:46,427 --> 00:09:47,943
I imagine there is too

163
00:09:48,414 --> 00:09:49,755
Where's the machine?

164
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,657
Any day now, Mr. Harrison.

165
00:09:51,681 --> 00:09:53,100
- Any day now.
- Yes, sir.

166
00:09:53,501 --> 00:09:54,704
What's it called?

167
00:09:55,211 --> 00:09:56,803
- The initials...
- The IBM.

168
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,511
International business machine.

169
00:09:58,956 --> 00:10:00,341
Space is a business

170
00:10:01,994 --> 00:10:03,069
I need a mathematician.

171
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,018
- I'll put in another request, sir.
- Another request.

172
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:08,914
Jesus Christ! We don't have
a single person, in this entire building,

173
00:10:08,939 --> 00:10:10,874
that can handle Analytic Geometry?

174
00:10:10,898 --> 00:10:12,526
That's what I've been told.

175
00:10:12,527 --> 00:10:15,013
Well, tell me something else, Ruth.
Like we're going to find such a person

176
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:17,530
before the Russians plant a flag
on the damn moon.

177
00:10:33,846 --> 00:10:35,145
Ladies, ladies

178
00:10:35,146 --> 00:10:37,002
If you're tardy, you don't
get an assignment

179
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:39,364
if you don't get an assignment
you don't have a job.

180
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,422
Eleanor. Data Reduction, Building 202.

181
00:10:43,447 --> 00:10:44,496
Data Reduction?

182
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,593
Well. You're welcome to join the
charmers in Magneto-plasmadynamics.

183
00:10:47,617 --> 00:10:49,267
Oh! No, ma'am.

184
00:10:49,368 --> 00:10:51,759
Thank you, Data Reduction's just fine.

185
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:55,718
- Mary.
- Present.

186
00:10:55,843 --> 00:10:58,498
The Mercury 7 prototype
has arrived for testing.

187
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,078
Mr. Zielinski's requesting you.

188
00:11:01,179 --> 00:11:02,888
For permanent assignment.

189
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:04,756
- Are you serious?
- Get moving.

190
00:11:07,093 --> 00:11:08,673
Oh! Thank you, Jesus!

191
00:11:09,318 --> 00:11:11,723
- Thank you, Jesus! Oh! Thank you.
- Mary

192
00:11:12,447 --> 00:11:13,848
Keep it inside

193
00:11:14,773 --> 00:11:16,473
I'm sorry, Dor

194
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:19,637
All right, Mrs. Late

195
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:21,552
You'll also be..

196
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,340
Mrs. Mitchell.

197
00:11:24,424 --> 00:11:26,541
We're on double time this mornin', girls.

198
00:11:26,931 --> 00:11:28,533
I need these calculations before lunch.

199
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:32,702
The Space Task Group needs a computer,
ASAP.

200
00:11:33,227 --> 00:11:34,960
Someone with a handle on
Analytic Geometry.

201
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,250
We can't fill the position outta
the East Group.

202
00:11:38,626 --> 00:11:39,921
Permanent or temp?

203
00:11:39,924 --> 00:11:41,323
Everything's temporary, Dorothy.

204
00:11:42,377 --> 00:11:44,597
- You have someone?
- Oh! Yes, ma'am.

205
00:11:44,998 --> 00:11:46,268
Katherine's the gal for that.

206
00:11:47,133 --> 00:11:49,213
She can handle any numbers you put
in front of her.

207
00:11:49,406 --> 00:11:51,058
I'll check her credentials.

208
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:55,198
Didn't think of comin' all the way
down here.

209
00:11:55,322 --> 00:11:57,322
Here.
Pinch press those out.

210
00:12:03,337 --> 00:12:04,445
Mrs. Mitchell!

211
00:12:05,134 --> 00:12:06,179
If I could.

212
00:12:07,554 --> 00:12:09,321
My application for supervisor, ma'am.

213
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:12,979
Was just wondering if they're still
considering me for that position.

214
00:12:13,403 --> 00:12:14,461
Yes.

215
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:16,025
Well, the official word is: no.

216
00:12:17,366 --> 00:12:20,782
They're not assignin' a permanent
supervisor for the Colored Group.

217
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:22,145
May I ask why?

218
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,825
I don't know "why."

219
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,319
I didn't ask "why."

220
00:12:25,343 --> 00:12:27,137
We need a Supervisor, ma'am.

221
00:12:27,238 --> 00:12:30,503
We haven't had one since Ms. Jansen got sick
It's been almost a year.

222
00:12:30,527 --> 00:12:32,228
Things are workin' just fine as is.

223
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:34,808
I'm doing the work of a Supervisor.

224
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:38,181
Well.
That's NASA, for ya.

225
00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:40,961
Fast with rocket ships.
Slow with advancement.

226
00:12:42,103 --> 00:12:43,863
Get those trajectories calcs worked out.

227
00:12:43,988 --> 00:12:45,519
We need ‘em for the Redstone test.

228
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:21,065
Mach 1 tunnel test, T-1 minute.

229
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,175
No shoe is worth your life

230
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,900
One.. One moment!

231
00:14:12,575 --> 00:14:13,770
Shut it down.

232
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,460
If we alter the exterior from smooth

233
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:26,554
to corrugated, the capsule might
have more stability,

234
00:14:27,322 --> 00:14:29,874
But the friction,
it's under during reentry..

235
00:14:30,338 --> 00:14:33,317
Most shield erosion occurs

236
00:14:33,991 --> 00:14:37,414
on the posterior side abutting
the retro-boosters.

237
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:38,633
Conclusion?

238
00:14:41,764 --> 00:14:44,358
The area closest to the boosters
is closest to the heat.

239
00:14:45,863 --> 00:14:47,717
Coupled with rising temperatures
on reentry,

240
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,318
the contacts soften.

241
00:14:50,645 --> 00:14:54,436
We could consider another fastener
other than bolts.

242
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,560
Yes

243
00:14:58,671 --> 00:14:59,730
Yes.

244
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:08,271
There's another opening in
the Engineer Training Program.

245
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:12,239
Flat head rivets would reduce wind drag.

246
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,076
Mary! A person with an engineer's
mind should be an engineer.

247
00:15:16,077 --> 00:15:18,608
You can't be a Computer
the rest of your life.

248
00:15:18,633 --> 00:15:19,728
Mr. Zielinski.

249
00:15:20,301 --> 00:15:21,782
I'm a Negro woman.

250
00:15:22,382 --> 00:15:24,191
I'm not gonna to entertain the impossible

251
00:15:24,418 --> 00:15:27,604
And I'm a polish Jew whose parents
died in a Nazi prison camp.

252
00:15:28,084 --> 00:15:30,316
Now I'm standing beneath a space ship,

253
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,930
that's going to carry an astronaut
to the stars.

254
00:15:34,054 --> 00:15:37,374
I think we can say,
we are living the impossible.

255
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:39,540
Let me ask you..

256
00:15:39,743 --> 00:15:41,432
If you were a white male,

257
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,830
Would you wish to be an engineer?

258
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,125
I wouldn't have to.
I'd already be one.

259
00:15:48,756 --> 00:15:50,461
Skirts must be worn past the knee.

260
00:15:50,486 --> 00:15:52,190
Sweaters are preferred to blouses.

261
00:15:52,364 --> 00:15:53,399
No jewelry.

262
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,531
A simple pearl necklace is the exception.

263
00:15:56,531 --> 00:15:59,024
Your supervisor is Mr. Al Harrison.

264
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,614
Director of the Space Task Group.

265
00:16:01,691 --> 00:16:04,408
You'll write research,
proof calculations, so forth.

266
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,674
Don't talk to Mr. Harrison lest
he talks to you.

267
00:16:08,755 --> 00:16:10,786
Not many Computers last
more than a few days,

268
00:16:11,394 --> 00:16:13,313
He's been through a dozen
in as many months.

269
00:16:14,152 --> 00:16:15,248
Come on, keep up

270
00:16:15,773 --> 00:16:17,810
Things move fast around here

271
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:19,994
Your clearance.

272
00:16:21,074 --> 00:16:23,374
They've never had a colored in here before,
Katherine.

273
00:16:24,132 --> 00:16:25,233
Don't embarrass me.

274
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,021
This wasn't emptied last night.

275
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:54,684
I'm sorry. I'm not the..

276
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,650
Custodian.

277
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,170
Excuse me, ma'am.
Mr. Harrison's Computer reporting.

278
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:17,960
Take the desk in the back.
I'll get your work in a..

279
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,020
Bit.

280
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,100
Mr. Harrison won't warm up to you,
don't expect it.

281
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,880
Do your work, keep your head down.

282
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,610
Thank you.

283
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,490
Go on. Get settled.

284
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,060
Paul,

285
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,040
Why are we still losing shingles off
the heat shield?

286
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,208
Well, We're working with a
prototype of the capsule, Al.

287
00:17:49,233 --> 00:17:51,744
It's little as one third the size..
- I get that. So..

288
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,470
What do you do with our
million dollar fan, Karl?

289
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,824
- Turn it down?
- No, I don't think...

290
00:17:57,849 --> 00:17:59,654
Hey! That was a joke.

291
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,880
Paul, if the heat shield comes off

292
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,818
what d'you think happens to our astronaut?

293
00:18:04,843 --> 00:18:05,685
I know.

294
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,260
So we're gonna..

295
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,187
We're gonna come up with a solve, right?

296
00:18:09,212 --> 00:18:10,714
Yes, sir. We're working on it.

297
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,857
Ruth, what's the status on that Computer?

298
00:18:12,882 --> 00:18:14,574
She's right behind you, Mr. Harrison.

299
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,780
Does she handle Analytic Geometry?

300
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,270
Absolutely. And she speaks.

301
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,830
Yes, sir. I do.

302
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,220
- Which one?
- Both.

303
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,160
Geometry and speaking.

304
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,270
Ruth. Give me that.

305
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,140
Do you think you..

306
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,260
You think you can find me the Frenet frame
for this data,

307
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,402
Using the GramSchmidt...

308
00:18:44,427 --> 00:18:46,524
With Orthogonalization algorithm.
Yes, sir.

309
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,190
I prefer it over Euclidean coordinates.

310
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,690
OK. Good.

311
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,560
Good. Then, I'm going to need it
by the end of the day.

312
00:18:57,584 --> 00:18:58,529
Yes.

313
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:01,029
I'm also going to ask you to check
Mr. Stafford's math

314
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,162
as well as others on this
floor from time to time.

315
00:19:03,187 --> 00:19:04,534
I can.. I can handle that, Al.

316
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,830
I'm sure you can, Paul.
I'm sure they all can.

317
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,639
But if that were the case,

318
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,350
Shingles wouldn't be flying off the
heat shield now, would they?

319
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:15,720
Excuse me, could I have
everyone's attention for a moment?

320
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,500
Thank you. Just a..

321
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,590
Just to be clear..

322
00:19:21,815 --> 00:19:24,964
In 14 days the Mercury 7
will be here for training.

323
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,660
And I have no doubt in my mind
that they're going to be

324
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,000
asking us questions about our work.

325
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,650
I think that's a pretty reason
we're giving. We're putting a human..

326
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,633
On top of a missile and
shooting him into space

327
00:19:35,658 --> 00:19:37,634
And it's never been done before.

328
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,456
And because it's never been done.
Everything we do

329
00:19:40,581 --> 00:19:42,284
between now and
then is going to matter.

330
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,610
It's going to matter to their wives.

331
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,160
To their children.

332
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:51,500
I believe it's going to matter to
the whole damn country.

333
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,970
So this Space Task Group will be
as advertised.

334
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,060
America's greatest engineering
and scientific minds

335
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,610
are not gonna have a problem

336
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,870
with having their work checked,
are they, Paul?

337
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,250
No, sir.

338
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,080
Good. So let's have an amen, damnit

339
00:20:07,504 --> 00:20:09,079
Amen.

340
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,780
Amen.

341
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,110
All right!

342
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:42,660
My numbers are spot on.

343
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,820
I'll double check them, sir.
No problem.

344
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,240
- I'm not gonna be able to..
- Work on what you can read.

345
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,350
The rest is classified.
You don't have clearance.

346
00:21:22,235 --> 00:21:23,335
Excuse me...

347
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,960
May I ask you where the ladies' room is?

348
00:21:24,961 --> 00:21:27,361
Sorry, I have no idea where
your bathroom is?

349
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,510
Yes, sir.

350
00:21:30,434 --> 00:21:31,534
Ah! Yes.

351
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,167
- Ruth!
- Yes, Mr. Harrison.

352
00:22:58,992 --> 00:23:00,784
Where's that girl with the numbers?

353
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,280
On a... break.

354
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,310
We take breaks now?

355
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,260
My God, where have you been?
Are you finished yet?

356
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:38,950
Almost.
He said about the end of the day?

357
00:23:38,975 --> 00:23:41,534
The end of the day around
here was yesterday.

358
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,589
I need those done first.

359
00:23:43,614 --> 00:23:44,930
He wants those done first.

360
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,850
- OK!
- Get going.

361
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,900
Mr. Harrison.

362
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,300
Oh! Yeah, just set up,
you know.

363
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,180
And Stafford's heat shield calcs?

364
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,930
It's hard to be sure, sir.

365
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:11,130
Hard to be sure.

366
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,080
You know what we're doing here?

367
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,030
Trying to put a man into space, sir.

368
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,560
That's right.

369
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:21,770
That's right. So you can
throw that in the trash.

370
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,150
Excuse me?

371
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,200
I said you can throw it away

372
00:25:26,155 --> 00:25:27,156
Here.

373
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,690
It's not an insult to your work.
It's just..

374
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,910
.. Obsolete.
That's how fast things are moving around here.

375
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,190
If I said I was sorry,
I'd be saying it all day.

376
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,380
What I'm asking you to do.. What I'm
asking everyone in that room,

377
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:44,030
all my... geniuses,
is to look beyond the numbers.

378
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,230
To look around them.

379
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,110
Through them.

380
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,530
For answers to questions we don't even
know to ask.

381
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,330
Math that doesn't yet exist.

382
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,800
Because without it,
we're not going anywhere.

383
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,150
I mean, we're staying on the ground.
We're not...

384
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,370
flying into space. We're not..

385
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,490
Circling the earth. And we're certainly
not touching the moon. And in my mind..

386
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,470
In my mind, I'm already there.

387
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,400
Are you?

388
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,310
Yes, sir.

389
00:26:15,315 --> 00:26:16,415
Good.

390
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,500
Because I don't need another smart girl
with an adding machine.

391
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,880
Can I go, sir?

392
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,690
Go? Yeah. Go, yeah.

393
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,330
Yes, you can go

394
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:59,610
I'm saying this is so much.
I'm not saying that.. I..

395
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,480
We've been waiting for hours.

396
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,870
Next time you take the bus.

397
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,600
She's in a mood.

398
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,050
I haven't been late one day in ten years.
Haven't been out sick.

399
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,610
Haven't complained. My work's on time.
It's done right. It's done well.

400
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,819
It's not fair, that's a fact.

401
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,473
What's not fair is having
the responsibility of the Supervisor,

402
00:27:38,598 --> 00:27:41,054
but not the title or the pay.

403
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,360
Watching you two move on.

404
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:44,930
Now don't get me wrong.

405
00:27:45,354 --> 00:27:47,454
Any upward movement is movement for us all

406
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:50,678
It just isn't movement for me.

407
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:55,002
Truth be told, Dorothy, I don't really know
if I can keep up in that room.

408
00:27:55,426 --> 00:27:57,626
I'll be back with the Computers in a week,

409
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,943
or out of a job entirely.

410
00:27:59,968 --> 00:28:04,095
Oh, please! You're better with the numbers
than anyone in the cabin and you know it.

411
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:07,260
Make that pencil move as fast as
your mind does, you'll be fine.

412
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,355
And you. Have some respect! Get
your damn feet off my dash board.

413
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,564
This isn't your living room.

414
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,170
I sound like a supervisor, don't I?

415
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,451
A mean, ole salty one.

416
00:28:20,676 --> 00:28:22,734
Riddled with authority.
No question.

417
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,460
You don't mess with, Mrs. Vaughan.

418
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:29,069
Turn that music up

419
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:47,150
- Goodnight, Katherine!
- Bye, Kath!

420
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:49,675
Goodnight, ladies!
See you in the morning.

421
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,670
- Hey baby
- Hello, mamma.

422
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,070
I was fixing to call the National Guard.

423
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,720
Sorry, Momma.

424
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:08,460
New assignment.

425
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,490
Space Task Group.

426
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:12,814
Oh my word, that sounds important

427
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,060
It's a promotion?

428
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,710
Might be a slight promotion.

429
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,500
But you want the job, right?

430
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,260
I think so.

431
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,780
It's a challenge. But..

432
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,790
Well, it's nothing you can't handle,
Katherine.

433
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,540
Thank you, mamma.

434
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:35,930
- Are they asleep yet?
- They're pretending to be.

435
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,820
They're not pretending well enough

436
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,170
Thank you, mamma.
Love you.

437
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,810
This is my bed!

438
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,650
What are you doing?

439
00:29:49,674 --> 00:29:54,299
It's not fair how Joylette gets to
sleep by herself cause she's the oldest.

440
00:29:54,323 --> 00:29:55,709
Yes it is fair

441
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:59,150
Constance, Kathy, sit.

442
00:30:04,005 --> 00:30:09,140
Now, I understand you want to be grown.
And have your own space

443
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,550
So whoever sleeps in that bed,

444
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:13,480
in Joylette's place,

445
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,440
will also do the dishes,

446
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:19,780
take out the trash,
and do all of Joylette's chores

447
00:30:20,204 --> 00:30:21,904
That's okay. Never mind.

448
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:25,260
She's not so terrible to share with.

449
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:27,884
OK.

450
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:31,010
Then don't let me come home and find you
like this again, you hear me?

451
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,960
You're supposed to been asleep,
a long time ago.

452
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,600
We just wanted to say goodnight.

453
00:30:35,924 --> 00:30:38,624
You've been gone for 300 hours.

454
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:44,370
I work a full-time job now. You all know that.

455
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:49,140
I have to be mommy and daddy.

456
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,660
I miss your father just as much as anyone

457
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,660
He's with his angels.

458
00:30:58,384 --> 00:31:00,584
Yes. He's with all his angels.

459
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:02,160
And he's watching over us.

460
00:31:02,684 --> 00:31:04,994
Every minute. OK?

461
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:08,560
That's why we have to be strong.
All right?

462
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:11,700
- Yes, Mamma.
- Yeah get some rest, OK?

463
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,250
- Mamma?
- Yes, baby.

464
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:17,260
Are the Russians fixing to attack us?

465
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:19,100
Where'd you get that from?

466
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:22,080
We had to hide under our desks today.
All scrunched up.

467
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,370
OK, baby. That's called a drill.

468
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,620
It means ..

469
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,780
You practice safety, just in case
something happens.

470
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,930
Truth is, we don't know what
they're doing up there.

471
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:40,640
- You're going up to space too?
- No, baby. But..

472
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:45,790
I'm going to do what I can help those
brave men get there. Yes, I'm.

473
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,700
You could fly up to space if you wanted to,
Mamma. You can be an astronaut.

474
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,360
- Did you draw this?
- Yes, mamma.

475
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,820
Is that me?

476
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,500
You see this?

477
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:04,020
Oh, my goodness, I love you, baby.

478
00:32:04,344 --> 00:32:07,344
- Me too
- I know, I know. Come here.

479
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:10,160
All right!
Now this time really go to bed.

480
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,400
I love you all.
Goodnight.

481
00:32:13,924 --> 00:32:15,924
Goodnight.
I love my picture, baby.

482
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,390
- Praise God!
- Praise God!

483
00:32:31,414 --> 00:32:33,690
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

484
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:42,960
Praise God that change is coming.

485
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,480
From the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference,

486
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,630
to the good Reverend Dr. King,

487
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:51,930
Hallelujah!

488
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,730
To the students sitting in

489
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,670
at lunch counters in North Carolina.

490
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:59,620
His faith in us has no limits

491
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,240
The good Lord..

492
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,290
Has our very own women..

493
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,100
Workin' on rocket ships!

494
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,190
And we have National Guardsmen

495
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:14,370
defending our freedom

496
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,600
Give a shout of praise for Colonel
Jim Johnson.

497
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:21,030
Returning home by the grace of God,

498
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,630
to set up a National Guard unit

499
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,360
right here in Hampton.

500
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:29,930
- Can I get a "Hallelujah" in here?!
- Hallelujah!

501
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,759
I just don't understand..
I just.. I don't..

502
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,671
I don't understand.

503
00:33:37,696 --> 00:33:39,744
I don't want to talk
about this again, OK?

504
00:33:40,015 --> 00:33:41,815
A female engineer?

505
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,480
A female engineer.

506
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:46,660
We're Negro, baby. Ain't no
such thing. Understand it.

507
00:33:46,684 --> 00:33:48,129
It's not like that there, Levi.

508
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:51,910
You can't "apply" for freedom. Freedom
is never granted to the oppressed.

509
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,270
It's got to be demanded. Taken.

510
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,410
Stop quoting your slogans at me.

511
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,820
There's more than one way to
achieve something.

512
00:33:58,830 --> 00:33:59,940
I don't want any greens.

513
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:02,170
I tell you about interrupting?

514
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,070
Here, try this, baby.

515
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,500
You gonna eat them greens too.

516
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:10,080
Kids need to eat their vegetables.

517
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,850
You'd know that if you was at home.

518
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:17,070
You better settle down, Levi Jackson.

519
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,300
Lest you want this female's mind
right here, in front of everybody.

520
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,130
All I'm saying

521
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,480
Don't play the fool.

522
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,410
I don't want to see you get hurt.

523
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,683
NASA's never ever given you gals your due,

524
00:34:30,708 --> 00:34:32,994
having a couple of extra degrees
ain't gonna change that.

525
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:36,870
Civil rights ain't always civil.

526
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,410
I don't want any greens either.

527
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,330
No lip, little miss. Your brother
gets them, and so do you.

528
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,000
I hear he's planning on staying
in the area.

529
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,340
Well. That's good for him.

530
00:34:56,164 --> 00:34:58,470
Katherine,
go find your way over there.

531
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,890
That Colonel Jim is a tall glass of water

532
00:35:01,914 --> 00:35:05,714
That he is.
Tall. Strong. Commanding.

533
00:35:05,738 --> 00:35:09,238
- And I bet he's like that day and night.
- Mary

534
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:12,490
It's Sunday
Please, have some shame.

535
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,910
I will not.

536
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:18,190
- Mm. I think he's smiling over here.
- At you

537
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:26,630
- I'm not smiling back.
- You're all teeth right now.

538
00:35:26,654 --> 00:35:27,754
I am not

539
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,600
- He's coming over
- Now, why would he be doing that?

540
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:35,210
- Because Mary's waving at him
- No! Ladies, I'm not..

541
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,820
Too late. Fix your hair on the side.

542
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,548
I'm Dorothy Vaughan. That's Mary Jackson.
I believe you met her husband, Levi.

543
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:43,110
Yes, ma'am. Good to meet you all.

544
00:35:43,111 --> 00:35:44,835
And Ms. Katherine Goble.

545
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,650
She's not married. She's a widow.

546
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,050
With three beautiful little girls,

547
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,870
so well-behaved.
Angels on earth, is what we'd like to call 'em.

548
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,040
- Dorothy, slice-a pie?
- I'd love one

549
00:35:56,264 --> 00:35:57,669
Excuse me

550
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,530
You already have a slice-a pie, Doro..

551
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,092
Well, I was just

552
00:36:05,117 --> 00:36:07,814
- fixing my three babies some plates.
- May I help?

553
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,360
Sure.
Ah! Fruit salad!

554
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:16,080
Pastor mentioned you're computer
at NASA

555
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:19,050
- Yes
- What's that entail?

556
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,552
We calculate the mathematics
necessary to enable

557
00:36:23,577 --> 00:36:25,644
launch and landing for
the Space Program.

558
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:29,820
- Pretty heady stuff!
- Yes, it is.

559
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,400
They let women handle that sort of..

560
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,760
That's.. Not what I mean

561
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,350
What do you mean?

562
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:47,330
I am.. Just surprised something so..
Taxing

563
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:49,070
Mr. Johnson

564
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,710
If I were you, I'd quit talking right now

565
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:54,420
I don't mean any disrespect

566
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:58,199
I'll have you know, I was
the first Negro female

567
00:36:58,224 --> 00:37:01,384
student at West Virginia
University Graduate School.

568
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:05,077
On any given day,
I analyze the manometer levels

569
00:37:05,102 --> 00:37:07,774
for air displacement
friction and velocity.

570
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:11,686
And compute over 10,000
calculations by cosine,

571
00:37:11,711 --> 00:37:14,664
square root and lately
Analytic Geometry.

572
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:17,839
By hand. There are 20 bright,

573
00:37:17,864 --> 00:37:20,574
highly capable Negro women in the
West Computing Group,

574
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,560
and we're proud to be doing our
part for the country.

575
00:37:24,361 --> 00:37:25,485
So, yes

576
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:28,190
They let women do some things at NASA,
Mr. Johnson.

577
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:30,000
And it's not because we wear skirts

578
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,180
It's because we wear glasses

579
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,650
Have a good day

580
00:37:50,015 --> 00:37:54,230
Scott, welcome to Langley.
Welcome to Langley.

581
00:37:54,554 --> 00:37:56,554
Right here, Gentlemen

582
00:38:06,645 --> 00:38:08,645
That's Alan Shepard.

583
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,560
US Navy pilot. He could be
the first man in space.

584
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,570
That's Scott Carpenter and
Walter Schirra.

585
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:15,810
Also Navy pilots.

586
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,460
All under 5'11", 180 lbs.

587
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,205
IQs over 130.

588
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:23,004
And handsome must
be a requirement too.

589
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:25,682
How could you possibly be
ogling these white men?

590
00:38:25,807 --> 00:38:29,044
It's equal rights. I have the
right to see fine in every color.

591
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,590
That's John Glenn.

592
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,720
He's the only Marine Corps pilot.

593
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,870
Gentlemen, if we may..
Much to see around here.

594
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,930
We haven't shaken all the hands yet.

595
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,752
- We have a fairly tight itinerary, Colonel.
- Ruth, it's fine.

596
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:42,890
- He's coming straight.
- Look around ahead.

597
00:38:43,015 --> 00:38:45,665
Ladies. Didn't wanna
run off without saying hello

598
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,233
They seem to be
in a big rush around here.

599
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,719
The Russians certainly aren't
slowing down any.

600
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,419
They can't build the refrigerator, how
the heck they beat us into space?

601
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,360
What do you ladies do for NASA?

602
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,010
- Calculate your trajectories.
Launch and landing.

603
00:38:59,035 --> 00:39:01,244
- I can't get anywhere without the numbers.
- No, sir.

604
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:03,210
Mary Jackson, Mr. Glenn.

605
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,760
Engineering. And I'm proud as
the devil to be workin' with you.

606
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,190
Thank you, Mary.

607
00:39:08,214 --> 00:39:09,669
John!

608
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:11,960
- I must take it inside
- Yes, sir.

609
00:39:11,984 --> 00:39:13,589
Guys!

610
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:53,065
Mr. Harrison wants you
to confirm launch

611
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,024
and landing for the
Redstone Rocket test.

612
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:03,470
I cannot work on what I cannot see,
Mr. Stafford.

613
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,199
It's illegible.

614
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,982
Those numbers have already been
confirmed by two engineers

615
00:40:07,007 --> 00:40:08,853
in this department, and myself.

616
00:40:08,878 --> 00:40:11,014
This is more or less
a dummy check.

617
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:50,630
This one, like make a two. Make
a double. OK? Get it?

618
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,050
No one thought to measure these things.

619
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,160
I'm afraid, not. Sir.

620
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:01,070
Would you like us to stop?

621
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,410
No. No, just..

622
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,240
I see, no. Just keep going.

623
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,890
In fact

624
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:11,410
- Use.. Use the big hammer
- Yes, sir.

625
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:14,160
Come on, use the big hammer.
You heard the man. Let's go!

626
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:42,590
Ma'am.

627
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,330
Our runner can pick up your work, Dorothy.

628
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,460
You need to be workin',
not walkin'.

629
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:52,380
Oh! It's break time, ma'am.
No trouble at all.

630
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,090
Well, since you made the trip

631
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,300
you can take that batch over there

632
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:59,130
Sure thing, Mrs. Mitchell.

633
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,698
You need somethin' else?

634
00:42:03,723 --> 00:42:05,224
Yes, ma'am.

635
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:08,370
I was wondering if you knew what
they're building over in the Tech Wing.

636
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,890
It's called an IBM.

637
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,260
A mainframe machine.

638
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:18,210
Apparently, it can do our calculations
in a fraction of the time.

639
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:21,870
Guess that's good for NASA.

640
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:27,930
Hurry on, now.
Best if you do it in one trip.

641
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:46,660
Excuse me

642
00:43:31,095 --> 00:43:32,245
Is that correct?

643
00:43:33,869 --> 00:43:35,169
Yeah

644
00:43:41,945 --> 00:43:43,645
Whose work is that?

645
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:46,970
I said, whose work is that?!

646
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:51,300
Katherine Goble, sir.

647
00:43:56,430 --> 00:43:59,100
How did you know the Redstone
couldn't support orbital flight?

648
00:43:59,124 --> 00:44:00,449
That's classified information

649
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:01,810
It's top secret.

650
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:04,729
Well, it's no secret why the
Redstone test keep failing

651
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:07,613
its flight for sub-orbital flight,
but it can't handle the weight of the capsule

652
00:44:07,638 --> 00:44:09,304
and push it into space.

653
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,770
Numbers don't lie.

654
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,350
And you figured it all out with this?

655
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,360
Half the data is redacted

656
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:22,030
What's there tells the story
if you read between the lines.

657
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:25,310
The distance from launch to orbit, we know.
Then mass we know.

658
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:27,400
The Mercury Capsule weight, we know.

659
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,080
And the speeds are there.. In the data.

660
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:32,060
You did the math.

661
00:44:32,684 --> 00:44:34,084
Yes, sir.

662
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,910
I looked beyond.

663
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:40,600
And how do you know about the
Atlas rocket?

664
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:45,180
That's not math.

665
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:48,710
That data's not here. Like he said,
it's classified.

666
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:56,440
I held it up to the light.

667
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:59,640
- You held it up to the light?
- Yes, sir.

668
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:06,620
Yep. There it is.

669
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,470
Atlas

670
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,490
What's your name?

671
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,240
Katherine Goble.

672
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:16,655
- Are you a spy, Katherine?
- Am I what?

673
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,124
- I'm saying, are you a Russian spy?
- No, sir.

674
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:20,980
I'm not Russian.

675
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:24,300
She's not Russian, sir.

676
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:28,067
All right then, we have
nothing to lose here.

677
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:30,587
Give her everything she needs
to work on Shepard's trajectories.

678
00:45:30,612 --> 00:45:32,244
Without redaction.
Are we clear now?

679
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:33,870
Right.
Are we sure about this?

680
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:35,790
What's the issue, Paul?
You heard her.

681
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:37,700
She's not a spy.

682
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:40,494
I.. I just don't think it's a good idea.

683
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:42,464
You know what I think is a good idea?

684
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,050
Darker ink.

685
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:46,970
I think darker ink is a good idea.
Ruth, could pass it along?

686
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,049
Yes, sir.

687
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:50,060
- Thank you, Katherine
- Thank you, sir.

688
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:58,460
This interrogation is over

689
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,719
You can probably get to the
moon and back with this.

690
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,419
Just not the bathroom.

691
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:23,025
At least they're not
blind to what you do.

692
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:24,454
It's not going to matter soon.

693
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,050
This IBM's going to put us all out of work.

694
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:29,670
What can we do about it?

695
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:31,800
Only one thing to do

696
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:34,500
Learn all we can.
Make ourselves valuable.

697
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:37,623
Somewhere down the line a human being's
going to have to push the buttons.

698
00:46:37,648 --> 00:46:38,684
That's right.

699
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,020
Oh, mercy

700
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:44,208
Well, she must be lost.

701
00:46:44,233 --> 00:46:47,794
NASA doesn't commission females
for the Engineer Training Program.

702
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:52,210
That position is available to any
qualified applicant.

703
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,999
Right. Except you don't have
the educational requirements.

704
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,750
I have a Bachelors Degree in
Mathematics and Physical Sciences.

705
00:46:57,775 --> 00:46:59,794
It's the same as most
engineers around here.

706
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:04,163
Well, we now require advanced extension
courses through the University of Virginia.

707
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:06,804
It's in the Employee Handbook.
An addendum.

708
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,650
Case you haven't read it

709
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,740
Every time we have a chance to get
ahead, they move the finish line.

710
00:47:12,765 --> 00:47:15,083
I just follow the rules around here.
And I expect..

711
00:47:15,108 --> 00:47:17,368
Everyone who works for
me to follow them as well.

712
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,410
There are no special circumstances
for anyone.

713
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,340
You all should be thankful,
you have jobs at all.

714
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:30,800
"For those that cannot attend classes

715
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:32,910
at the University of Virginia,

716
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:36,900
Advanced Extension Courses are
available at Hampton High School."

717
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:39,760
That's still a segregated school, Mary

718
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:43,870
Virginia acts like Brown vs. Board
of Education never happened.

719
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:48,620
They'll never gonna allow a colored woman
just take classes at an all white school!

720
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:52,190
- Sounds about right.
- That's all you're gonna say?

721
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,058
Well, I'm not going to sit
here all day and listen to you

722
00:47:54,083 --> 00:47:56,364
complain about the way things
are, we're tryin to play cards.

723
00:47:56,810 --> 00:47:59,590
Petition the court. Fight for what
you want. But quit talking about it

724
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,800
- I've been complaining?
- For days

725
00:48:04,824 --> 00:48:06,124
Ladies

726
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:08,310
Not one more peep about work.

727
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:10,270
Deal me in

728
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:12,370
Katherine,
come on

729
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,510
You

730
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:17,070
Yeah! I needed this!
Thank you!

731
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,070
Don't give her any more Katherine

732
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:24,200
I can't. She drank it all.

733
00:48:24,424 --> 00:48:26,424
Yes.
I'm fine

734
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:28,700
I'm as fine as I've ever been.

735
00:48:28,725 --> 00:48:31,224
You're as drunk as you've ever been.

736
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,400
Come on! Let's dance, girls.

737
00:48:34,824 --> 00:48:37,124
Come on, Kath!
Let's dance.

738
00:48:37,148 --> 00:48:38,284
Go dance, Katherine.

739
00:48:38,285 --> 00:48:40,784
Come on!

740
00:48:40,785 --> 00:48:42,052
We're gonna teach you how

741
00:48:42,077 --> 00:48:47,354
Keep going, here! All right.
Slow! Here slow down.

742
00:49:09,554 --> 00:49:19,554
Segregation must go!

743
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,880
Don't pay attention to any of that. We're
not part of that trouble. Go on.

744
00:49:36,585 --> 00:49:37,585
Leonard..

745
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:39,270
We must have done it.

746
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:45,555
We don't want any trouble in here.

747
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:47,980
Oh! I'm not here for any trouble. Ma'am.

748
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,450
What are you here for?

749
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:51,680
A book.

750
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,260
You have books in the colored section.

751
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:57,050
It doesn't have what I'm looking for.

752
00:49:57,170 --> 00:49:58,950
Well, that's just the way it is.

753
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,106
Well, you know better...

754
00:50:05,107 --> 00:50:07,330
Get your hands off my boys.
Don't touch them.

755
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:09,730
You have a blessed day.

756
00:50:18,955 --> 00:50:22,220
Separate and equal are
two different things.

757
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,215
Just cause it's the way
doesn't make it right.

758
00:50:25,165 --> 00:50:26,215
Understand?

759
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:28,239
Yes, mamma.

760
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:33,155
You act right, you are right.
That's for certain. Understand?

761
00:50:33,579 --> 00:50:34,879
Yes, mamma.

762
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,150
You took that book, mamma?

763
00:50:42,774 --> 00:50:44,774
Son, I pay taxes.

764
00:50:44,815 --> 00:50:46,830
And taxes pay for everything
in that library.

765
00:50:46,854 --> 00:50:48,854
You can't take something
you've already paid for.

766
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:56,515
FORTRAN is a new and exciting language..

767
00:50:57,315 --> 00:51:00,325
Used by programmers to communicate
with computers...

768
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:04,285
It's exciting, as it's the way
of the future.

769
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,545
And everybody smile.

770
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:08,010
Everybody smile.

771
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:14,000
Make a wish!

772
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:19,230
Leonard, you need to get you a job now.

773
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:20,799
Two girls!

774
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,676
- Well, look at that.
- Look at what?

775
00:51:26,901 --> 00:51:28,220
What a surprise.

776
00:51:30,945 --> 00:51:32,345
I'll say.

777
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:34,940
- Howard must have invited him.
- Mmm. Hmmm.

778
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:37,000
Let me go help him
with those flowers

779
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:14,715
I believe I owe you an apology.

780
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:19,300
Well, is that it?

781
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,770
Can I make it while we dance?

782
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:36,490
I'm afraid I simply misspoke the other
day, Mrs. Goble.

783
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:41,180
I've been away for a long time.

784
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,820
I imagine, I'm just out of practice.

785
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:46,780
Mm-hmm.

786
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:49,410
Yeah. I was hoping you would allow me
to start over?

787
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:52,673
Mm-hmm.

788
00:52:52,698 --> 00:52:54,385
So, the thing is..

789
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,020
I have an interest in getting
to know you better.

790
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:58,990
Mm-hmm.

791
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:02,450
You are one tough customer. Huh?

792
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:06,200
You haven't said you're sorry yet

793
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,710
Right.
Of course.

794
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:14,010
I'm sorry, Katherine.

795
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:16,710
For what, Jim?

796
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:19,030
Underestimating you.

797
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:21,290
And any other woman like you.

798
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:25,540
Though I don't imagine there's many.

799
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:29,910
That's good practice, right there.

800
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:35,150
We interrupt this musical programming
with breaking news.

801
00:53:36,874 --> 00:53:40,174
The Soviet news agency has announced
that Russian cosmonaut,

802
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:43,500
Yuri Gagarin, has become
the first man in space.

803
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:47,960
Gagarin completed one full orbit around
the planet in 108 minutes.

804
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:51,440
Stay tuned to the station for more
details, as they become available.

805
00:53:51,664 --> 00:53:54,909
Well,
I guess that puts us behind the curve.

806
00:53:55,210 --> 00:53:57,927
The Vostok 1 rocket,
delivered Russian cosmonaut

807
00:53:57,952 --> 00:54:02,263
Yuri Gagarin, 3KA capsule
into orbit at 6:07 UTC.

808
00:54:02,764 --> 00:54:07,844
Reentering Russian Air Space at 7:55 UTC.
Proving conclusively

809
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:12,120
that man could survive orbital space flight
Gagarin was awarded the Order of Lenin

810
00:54:12,821 --> 00:54:13,845
Well..

811
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:16,080
They beat the pants off us.
Let's go..

812
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,990
Just learn how to fly to space.

813
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:23,500
And has been proclaimed a national hero.

814
00:54:24,424 --> 00:54:28,924
This is a day of unprecedented triumph
for the Russian space program,

815
00:54:29,248 --> 00:54:32,748
And a crushing blow for America
in the race for space.

816
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:34,930
I want to thank everyone for staying.

817
00:54:36,370 --> 00:54:38,840
I know it's late, and
after what we just saw

818
00:54:38,865 --> 00:54:41,544
I'm sure everyone's
probably anxious to go home.

819
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,350
But before we do, I just have
to ask the question

820
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:46,870
The same one

821
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,160
I've been asking myself all the way
over here, which is

822
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:56,330
How the hell did we find ourselves
in second place in a two men race?

823
00:54:57,230 --> 00:54:58,280
Anybody?

824
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,410
Paul?

825
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:04,230
I think Glenn said it pretty well.
They're just outworking us.

826
00:55:04,254 --> 00:55:05,889
And the reason I have to..

827
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:09,400
Think that is because I refuse to believe
that the Russians are smarter than us,

828
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:12,710
or that they have more technology.
Or that they care more.

829
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:16,030
But I don't know? Is that possible?

830
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:19,760
Is it possible that it actually means
more to them?

831
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:24,060
We're in the fight of our lives, people.

832
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:26,230
Not on some epic joyride!

833
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:28,820
I just saw seven faces

834
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:32,700
who weren't sure that
we can get there.

835
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,230
This is our problem.

836
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:40,230
And so, as of right now,

837
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:44,254
There's only two things you
need to know going forward

838
00:55:44,279 --> 00:55:47,194
One is, staying here working late
that's gonna be a fact of life.

839
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:50,710
And two, don't expect your
paychecks reflect the extra time

840
00:55:50,735 --> 00:55:53,064
it is gonna take to catch
up and pass those bastards.

841
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:57,241
For those of you that can't
work that way, I understand 'em

842
00:55:57,466 --> 00:55:59,234
thank you for
what you've done.

843
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:01,870
For everyone else,

844
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,460
I suggest you call your wives..

845
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:06,700
And tell them how it's gonna be.

846
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:08,310
I'll start with mine.

847
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:09,129
- Sam, keep it up
- Yes, sir

848
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:29,650
End of the day.

849
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:37,850
Okay. We're looking good...

850
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:43,530
Try!

851
00:57:53,915 --> 00:57:56,670
- Sir! It might be the selector latch!
- I'm taking a walk!

852
00:57:56,694 --> 00:57:59,194
We're honored to serve our country.
So, we don't think about..

853
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:02,145
Danger.
No time to be scared.

854
00:58:02,995 --> 00:58:04,055
We got a job to do

855
00:58:13,494 --> 00:58:14,579
Mrs. Jackson!

856
00:58:15,703 --> 00:58:17,979
Colored seats are at the back
of the courtroom.

857
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:19,360
Thank you, ma'am.

858
00:58:38,685 --> 00:58:41,285
So, which one of you wants to go first?

859
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:08,385
The IBM 7090 Data Processing System,

860
00:59:08,525 --> 00:59:14,150
It has a capability of solving of over
24,000 multiplications

861
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:16,430
per second!

862
00:59:16,455 --> 00:59:19,664
- Holy Moses, that's lightning fast
- They'll never get that to work.

863
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:24,070
It'll run eventually. And when it does
we have to know how to program it.

864
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:27,270
- Unless you'd rather be out of a job?
- No!

865
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:34,220
Mr. Z.

866
00:59:35,244 --> 00:59:37,226
I got a court date.

867
00:59:40,905 --> 00:59:43,490
Computer uses it as its high speed storage
unit

868
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:45,685
An information holding device.

869
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:49,430
So you have a brain

870
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:51,230
That, I can work with

871
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:57,400
that's in the wrong spot

872
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:02,790
That a girl!

873
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:07,380
- Ruth!
- Yes, sir.

874
01:00:07,390 --> 01:00:10,390
Get the Cape on the line.
Shepard's trajectories need to be updated.

875
01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:17,190
Where is she?

876
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:17,140
Where the hell have you been?

877
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:19,470
Everywhere I look you're not
where I need you to be.

878
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:22,420
And it's not my imagination. So where
the hell do you go everyday?

879
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:26,830
To the bathroom, sir.

880
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:28,590
The bathroom

881
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:31,550
To the damn bathroom!

882
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:33,640
For 40 minutes a day?

883
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:37,820
What do you do in there?

884
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:41,330
We are T-0 here.
I put a lot of faith in you.

885
01:01:43,650 --> 01:01:45,630
There's no bathroom for me here.

886
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:48,990
What do you mean there's
no bathroom for you here?

887
01:01:49,014 --> 01:01:50,614
There is no bathroom!

888
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:53,440
There are no colored bathrooms
in this building,

889
01:01:53,930 --> 01:01:56,068
or any building outside the West Campus.

890
01:01:56,070 --> 01:01:59,100
Which is half a mile away.
Did you know that?

891
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,610
I have to walk to Timbuktu
just to relieve myself

892
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:05,870
And I can't use one of the handy bikes.

893
01:02:06,270 --> 01:02:08,180
Picture that, Mr. Harrison

894
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:09,760
My uniform...

895
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:12,410
Skirt below my knees, my heels

896
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:16,040
and simple string of pearls.
Well, I don't own pearls.

897
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:19,464
Lord knows you don't pay the
coloreds enough to afford pearls!

898
01:02:20,330 --> 01:02:23,780
And I work like a dog day and night,

899
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:28,560
living off a coffee from a pot none of
you want to touch!

900
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:43,180
So, excuse me..

901
01:02:44,110 --> 01:02:47,050
If I have to go to the restroom
a few times a day

902
01:03:59,010 --> 01:04:00,600
There you have it!

903
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,750
No more colored restrooms.

904
01:04:06,830 --> 01:04:08,790
No more white restrooms.

905
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:12,190
Just plain old toilets.

906
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:13,920
Go wherever you damn well please.

907
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:16,070
Preferably closer to your desk.

908
01:04:23,635 --> 01:04:24,935
Here at NASA,

909
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:26,600
we all pee the same color

910
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:57,180
Heard you were fighting the flu.
Thought you could use some soup?

911
01:04:57,404 --> 01:04:59,104
Hot meal for the girls.

912
01:05:00,028 --> 01:05:01,828
Come on, in.

913
01:05:07,775 --> 01:05:08,975
Excuse me

914
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,260
OK, ladies
Let's say grace..

915
01:05:12,830 --> 01:05:14,150
Bow your heads.

916
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:20,150
Dear Lord!
Thank you for this meal..

917
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:24,670
We ask that you blessed this food,
so that it may bless our bodies.

918
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:26,350
In Jesus name, we pray.

919
01:05:28,990 --> 01:05:30,750
Amen.

920
01:05:34,594 --> 01:05:39,462
It's a history day here at Cape Canaveral,
and here what we can expect; Alan Shepard and

921
01:05:39,487 --> 01:05:44,418
Freedom 7 will be launched into space
at an altitude about 116 miles an hour.

922
01:05:44,442 --> 01:05:48,242
- Dorothy! Come on or you'll miss it!
- I'm coming.

923
01:05:58,447 --> 01:06:00,666
Freedom 7, we're gonna have to
bleed off some of the pressure

924
01:06:00,984 --> 01:06:02,601
the liquid oxygen tank

925
01:06:02,977 --> 01:06:05,121
that should reduce the temperature
inside the capsule, over

926
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:07,540
Any day now, Capcom.

927
01:06:07,550 --> 01:06:09,650
Fix your little problem,
and light this candle

928
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:12,120
Roger that, Freedom 7.
Standby.

929
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:19,030
Move to final countdown sequence.

930
01:06:19,030 --> 01:06:20,700
Moving to final countdown sequence.

931
01:06:20,725 --> 01:06:22,040
Roger that.

932
01:06:22,455 --> 01:06:23,685
And we're at T-10..

933
01:06:24,695 --> 01:06:29,780
9... 8... 7... 6...

934
01:06:30,270 --> 01:06:31,860
.. 5... 4...

935
01:06:32,965 --> 01:06:34,610
3... 2...

936
01:06:35,534 --> 01:06:37,534
1...
Zero!

937
01:06:40,475 --> 01:06:41,776
We have ignition

938
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:43,645
And we have liftoff!

939
01:06:44,369 --> 01:06:46,069
Get up there

940
01:06:54,505 --> 01:06:55,520
Get on up there.

941
01:07:19,710 --> 01:07:24,030
Trajectory is good.

942
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:26,899
Yaw is okay

943
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,499
Switching to manual roll.

944
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:35,240
For the eyes of the world

945
01:07:35,290 --> 01:07:37,008
now look into space,

946
01:07:37,033 --> 01:07:40,234
to the moon and to
the planets beyond..

947
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:45,436
And we have vowed...
that we shall not see it governed

948
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:49,346
by a hostile flag of conquest,
but by a banner

949
01:07:49,371 --> 01:07:54,733
of freedom and peace.
We set sail on this new sea,

950
01:07:55,258 --> 01:07:58,678
because there is new
knowledge to be gained

951
01:07:58,690 --> 01:08:00,450
and new rights to be won

952
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:05,040
We choose to go to the Moon in this decade
and do the other things

953
01:08:05,490 --> 01:08:08,989
not because they are easy,
but because they are hard.

954
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:13,789
Suppose we should all thank President
Kennedy for continued job security.

955
01:08:17,770 --> 01:08:19,390
Gus Grissom's up next.

956
01:08:19,570 --> 01:08:21,780
Another suborbital flight with a Redstone.

957
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:25,420
Our last shot before we strap
Glenn to the Atlas..

958
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:28,140
And.. Pray we can brıng him back down.

959
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:31,520
Yes, and I imagine he'd like us to have
the math worked out beforehand.

960
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:35,010
Good work, gentlemen.

961
01:08:35,290 --> 01:08:37,160
Go have dinner with your kids.
Then...

962
01:08:37,410 --> 01:08:39,010
let's get back to work.

963
01:09:11,870 --> 01:09:13,910
I think it's high time that
I kissed you, Kathe.

964
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:17,420
Oh. And why's that?

965
01:09:19,830 --> 01:09:21,960
Figure you're attracted to me
the same as I to you.

966
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:25,510
Is that right?

967
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:29,170
Or you would have told me to
get going a long time ago.

968
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:45,500
Haven't kissed a man in a long time.

969
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:48,570
Almost forgot how to.

970
01:10:02,205 --> 01:10:05,896
The FBI has arrested four white
men accused of throwing a fire

971
01:10:05,921 --> 01:10:09,729
bomb into a Freedom Riders' bus
south-side of Anniston, Alabama.

972
01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:11,930
- Hi, baby!
- Hello!

973
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:21,590
- The kids don't need to be watching this..
- They need to see this

974
01:10:23,370 --> 01:10:25,260
Everyone needs to see this.

975
01:10:30,910 --> 01:10:34,121
We think we're rendering a
great service to our nation.

976
01:10:34,146 --> 01:10:37,234
For this is not a struggle
for ourselves alone.

977
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:39,720
It is the struggle to save
the soul of America.

978
01:10:40,115 --> 01:10:41,715
Mary Jackson.

979
01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:44,560
Petition to attend courses at
Hampton High School.

980
01:10:48,570 --> 01:10:50,150
Good morning, your honor.

981
01:10:54,510 --> 01:10:56,900
Hampton High School is a white school,
Mrs. Jackson.

982
01:10:58,330 --> 01:11:00,090
Yes, your Honor.
I'm aware of that.

983
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:02,530
Virginia is still a segregated state.

984
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:05,360
Regardless of what the Federal
Government says, or regardless what..

985
01:11:05,850 --> 01:11:07,390
Supreme Court says our law..

986
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:09,490
Is the law.

987
01:11:09,570 --> 01:11:11,180
Your Honor,
if I may.

988
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:14,650
I believe there are special circumstances
to be considered.

989
01:11:14,710 --> 01:11:17,350
What would warrant
a colored woman attendin' a white school?

990
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:20,990
May I approach the bench, sir?

991
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:35,800
Your Honor,

992
01:11:35,850 --> 01:11:38,560
You of all people should understand
the importance of being first.

993
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:41,940
How's that, Mrs. Jackson?

994
01:11:42,310 --> 01:11:44,260
Well, you were the first in your family

995
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:46,110
to serve in the Armed Forces.

996
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:47,790
US Navy.

997
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:49,690
The first to attend University.

998
01:11:50,370 --> 01:11:51,980
George Mason.

999
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:56,370
And the first State Judge to be re-commissioned
by three consecutive Governors.

1000
01:11:57,030 --> 01:11:58,750
You've done some research.

1001
01:11:59,150 --> 01:12:00,420
Yes, sir.

1002
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:01,794
What's the point?

1003
01:12:02,019 --> 01:12:03,844
The point is, your Honor...

1004
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:08,260
No Negro woman in the State of Virginia
has ever attended an all white high school.

1005
01:12:08,470 --> 01:12:11,300
- It's unheard of.
- Yeah! Unheard of.

1006
01:12:12,270 --> 01:12:14,930
And before Alan Shepard
sat on top of a rocket,

1007
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:16,650
no other American had ever touched space.

1008
01:12:17,590 --> 01:12:22,030
And now, he will forever be remembered
as the US Navy man from New Hampshire.

1009
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:24,150
The first to touch the stars.

1010
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:27,200
And I, sir.

1011
01:12:27,370 --> 01:12:29,630
I plan on being an engineer at NASA.

1012
01:12:30,110 --> 01:12:33,930
But I can't do that without taking them
classes at that all-white high school.

1013
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:36,760
And I can't change the color of my skin.

1014
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:41,570
So, I have no choice.. But to be the first.

1015
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:44,510
Which I can't do without you, sir.

1016
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:46,720
Your Honor,

1017
01:12:46,810 --> 01:12:48,580
of all the cases you'll hear today,

1018
01:12:49,350 --> 01:12:51,200
which one will matter in a hundred years from now?

1019
01:12:52,670 --> 01:12:54,580
Which one will make you the "first?"

1020
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:08,200
Only the night classes.

1021
01:13:08,990 --> 01:13:10,640
Mrs. Jackson.

1022
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:52,349
- How late did you say it was gonna be?
- No more than 5 minutes sir.

1023
01:13:52,850 --> 01:13:54,229
Gus Grissom's coordinates..

1024
01:13:54,253 --> 01:13:57,663
I'd like to get a jump on
John Glenn's trajectory.

1025
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:00,420
Do you have any idea what you're asking?

1026
01:14:00,421 --> 01:14:02,990
An orbital launch
with an Atlas Rocket is going to take time.

1027
01:14:03,450 --> 01:14:04,790
Is there a problem?

1028
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:08,590
Mr. Harrison...

1029
01:14:09,010 --> 01:14:10,720
I was wondering....

1030
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:14,260
I've been wondering my whole life.
So just... Spit it out.

1031
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,380
Well, sir.

1032
01:14:18,570 --> 01:14:21,210
I'd like to get a jump on
John Glenn's trajectory.

1033
01:14:21,330 --> 01:14:24,130
This isn't about plugging in numbers,
this is about inventing the math.

1034
01:14:24,180 --> 01:14:26,844
I think we talked about that, right?
It doesn't exist.

1035
01:14:26,869 --> 01:14:28,074
I can do it, sir.

1036
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:31,140
Do you know any idea how exacting
these calculations have to be?

1037
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:34,420
It's like shooting a sawed-off shotgun
from a thousand feet,

1038
01:14:34,445 --> 01:14:37,259
and getting that one beebee through a hole
so tiny, you can't even see it.

1039
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:38,984
I'm an excellent shot, sir.

1040
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:41,230
How about Grissom's numbers. Paul?

1041
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:43,570
They've been spot on.

1042
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:47,870
Give Glenn's orbit a go.

1043
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:51,100
But you run it all through Stafford.
Understood?

1044
01:14:51,101 --> 01:14:52,145
Yes, sir.

1045
01:14:52,370 --> 01:14:54,090
Thank you.

1046
01:14:57,780 --> 01:14:59,510
Computers don't author reports.

1047
01:15:06,688 --> 01:15:08,342
Capcom, this is Liberty Bell 7

1048
01:15:09,395 --> 01:15:10,380
loud and clear

1049
01:15:12,419 --> 01:15:14,142
ok, it's nice ride up to now

1050
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:26,750
Liberty Bell 7 capsule is taking on water.

1051
01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:32,630
Gus Grissom is out of the capsule. Rescuers
are now going to pull him from the Ocean waves.

1052
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:35,640
Unfortunately,
Liberty Bell 7 capsule..

1053
01:15:36,064 --> 01:15:37,664
.. Is lost.

1054
01:15:48,270 --> 01:15:51,740
Mr. Harrison, Taxpayer money sank in
the ocean along with your capsule.

1055
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:54,540
What makes you think you can
bring John Glenn home safely?

1056
01:15:55,190 --> 01:15:58,860
Let me say first that discovery is never
for the sake of discovery, Gentlemen,

1057
01:15:58,870 --> 01:16:00,510
but for the sake of human survival.

1058
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,170
It will always come with the risk.

1059
01:16:05,550 --> 01:16:09,650
Whoever gets there first, will make the rules.
That's been true of every civilization. And so..

1060
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:13,420
I think the bigger question for
this body to consider is..

1061
01:16:13,444 --> 01:16:16,800
Who do you want calling the shots in space?

1062
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:19,900
We have to know what's out there, Senator.

1063
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:24,240
We have to touch the stars. If
only to ensure our own survival.

1064
01:16:24,265 --> 01:16:26,054
And only a man can do that.

1065
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:30,510
We'll get John Glenn home safely
because we have to,

1066
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:34,010
because he has to tell us what he saw.

1067
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:39,890
The Redstone Rocket went straight up.

1068
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:41,410
But the capsule..

1069
01:16:41,630 --> 01:16:44,250
.. Didn't have enough speed to go
into orbit. So came back down.

1070
01:16:44,940 --> 01:16:48,050
Essentially it's a triangle..
Earth, sub-orbit, Earth.

1071
01:16:48,430 --> 01:16:49,810
That math was known.

1072
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:52,450
That took Shepard,
took Grissom.

1073
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:55,160
That cannot take Glenn.

1074
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:57,600
Now, The Atlas Rocket..

1075
01:16:58,470 --> 01:17:01,475
That can push us into orbit.
It goes up

1076
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:04,414
delivers the capsule
into an elliptical orbit.

1077
01:17:04,450 --> 01:17:05,788
Earth's gravity keeps pulling it,

1078
01:17:05,813 --> 01:17:08,174
but it's going so fast that
it keeps missing the Earth.

1079
01:17:08,770 --> 01:17:10,130
That's how it stays in orbit.

1080
01:17:11,050 --> 01:17:12,870
Now, Getting it back down...

1081
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,880
That's the math we don't know.

1082
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:19,060
Yes, Katherine

1083
01:17:19,070 --> 01:17:21,718
So, the capsule will spin
around the Earth forever,

1084
01:17:21,743 --> 01:17:23,774
because there's nothing
to slow it down?

1085
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:28,660
That's right. Slowing it down at precisely
the right moment,

1086
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:30,450
by precisely the right amount

1087
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:31,590
That is the task.

1088
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:35,760
Yes, Katherine

1089
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:42,920
So, it means to move from an
elliptical orbit.. To a parabolic orbit?

1090
01:17:43,170 --> 01:17:45,700
Yes.
That's the Go/ No Go.

1091
01:17:47,020 --> 01:17:48,790
Now, this point is a pin head.

1092
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:52,900
- We bring him in too soon..
- He burns up on reentry.

1093
01:17:53,501 --> 01:17:57,630
That's right. We bring him too late,
and he's pushed out of Earth's gravity.

1094
01:17:57,770 --> 01:18:00,740
Any changes to mass, weight, speed, time,

1095
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:07,350
distance, friction... or a puff of wind..
Would alter the Go/No Go.

1096
01:18:07,730 --> 01:18:10,580
And we start our calculations.. Over

1097
01:18:11,304 --> 01:18:12,804
Yes.

1098
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:17,257
So, we need to be able to
choose this re-entry point.

1099
01:18:17,882 --> 01:18:20,904
This Go/No Go.
This has to be exact.

1100
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:22,330
Sam

1101
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:26,210
These are the latest Redstone numbers
and current capsule data.

1102
01:18:26,350 --> 01:18:28,430
Obviously, we know the launch spot

1103
01:18:28,710 --> 01:18:32,766
The Pentagon Briefing should illuminate
where the Navy needs the recovery zone.

1104
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:34,814
When we work backwards from there.

1105
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:37,920
And the rest is on us.
So, let's get to work.

1106
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:41,816
- Mr. Stafford.
- What, Katherine?

1107
01:18:41,841 --> 01:18:45,514
If I could attend the briefings, I
would be more useful to the project.

1108
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:47,630
Pentagon briefing is a closed door.

1109
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:50,300
Yes. But if we don't
have the information,

1110
01:18:51,010 --> 01:18:54,822
of the changes.. We can't keep up.
I need those changes as they occur.

1111
01:18:54,847 --> 01:18:57,505
- As you said, it's a pin head.
- Katherine, that's the job.

1112
01:18:57,530 --> 01:19:00,840
You asked for this assignment.
So just calculate with what you have.

1113
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:03,460
Or we'll find someone who can.

1114
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:11,820
OK.

1115
01:19:24,350 --> 01:19:25,570
That'a girl.

1116
01:19:26,475 --> 01:19:28,775
And what the hell are you doing?
You can't be in here

1117
01:19:29,099 --> 01:19:30,299
Who are you?

1118
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:32,320
I'm with the West Computing Group.

1119
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:34,254
Dorothy Vaughan, sir.

1120
01:19:34,279 --> 01:19:36,424
Well, this is a very
delicate piece of equipment.

1121
01:19:36,490 --> 01:19:39,170
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm just trying to be helpful.

1122
01:19:39,194 --> 01:19:40,894
Bill, we've got numbers.

1123
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:44,650
What kind of numbers?

1124
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,570
Well, I'll be.

1125
01:19:51,310 --> 01:19:52,950
What's your name again?

1126
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:54,830
Dorothy Vaughan.

1127
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:57,060
Dorothy Vaughan...

1128
01:20:04,170 --> 01:20:06,875
Sir, the parameters
for Friendship 7.

1129
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:10,504
Oh, this is all moot. We're
altering the window on the capsule.

1130
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:11,712
When did this happen?

1131
01:20:11,737 --> 01:20:13,944
6 minutes ago. The mass is changing.
Start over.

1132
01:20:13,968 --> 01:20:17,640
Sir.. If I could attend briefings..
I could stay current..

1133
01:20:17,650 --> 01:20:19,830
Katherine, we've been through this.
It is not possible.

1134
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:21,460
There's no protocol for women attending.

1135
01:20:21,910 --> 01:20:24,203
There's no protocol for a man
circling the Earth either, sir.

1136
01:20:24,228 --> 01:20:26,094
OK. That's just
the way things are.

1137
01:21:01,030 --> 01:21:04,200
Colonel Glenn's launch coordinates
accounting for the window change, sir.

1138
01:21:04,290 --> 01:21:07,289
I've told you this: Computers don't
author reports. Fix it.

1139
01:21:07,335 --> 01:21:09,435
Those are my calculations.
My name should be on it.

1140
01:21:09,559 --> 01:21:11,159
But it is not the way this works.

1141
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:13,790
Paul.
What's happening here?

1142
01:21:13,791 --> 01:21:16,620
Mr. Harrison,
I'd like to attend today's briefing.

1143
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:19,460
- Why's that?
- Well, sir, the data changes so fast.

1144
01:21:19,550 --> 01:21:23,620
The capsule changes. The weight and the
landing zones are all changing everyday.

1145
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,390
I do my work, you attend these briefings.
I have to start all over.

1146
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:29,850
Colonel Glenn launches in a few weeks.

1147
01:21:30,290 --> 01:21:31,860
We don't have the math figured out yet.

1148
01:21:32,775 --> 01:21:35,374
- Why is it she can't attend?
- Because she doesn't have clearance, Al.

1149
01:21:35,375 --> 01:21:38,674
I can not do my work effectively
if I do not have all of the data,

1150
01:21:38,675 --> 01:21:40,780
and all of the information
as soon as it's available.

1151
01:21:40,870 --> 01:21:42,469
I need to be in that room,
hearing what you hear.

1152
01:21:42,470 --> 01:21:45,665
Pentagon Briefings are not for civilians.
It requires the highest clearance.

1153
01:21:45,689 --> 01:21:47,289
I feel like I'm the best person
to present my calculations

1154
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:49,280
- You're not gonna let this go are you?
- No, I'm not

1155
01:21:49,304 --> 01:21:52,804
Let her in? She's a woman.
There's no protocol for a woman attending.

1156
01:21:52,828 --> 01:21:54,828
Okay, I get that part, Paul.

1157
01:21:57,470 --> 01:22:01,130
But within these walls,
who... makes the rules?

1158
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:06,370
You, sir. You're the boss.
You just have to act like one. Sir.

1159
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:16,370
You keep quiet.

1160
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:18,679
Thank you.

1161
01:22:19,204 --> 01:22:20,794
Good morning.

1162
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:22,990
Gentlemen

1163
01:22:31,660 --> 01:22:35,270
This is Katherine Goble with our
Trajectory and Launch Window Division.

1164
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:37,850
Her work is pertinent to
today's proceedings.

1165
01:22:39,590 --> 01:22:42,700
Come on.
Go get her a chair.

1166
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:45,747
We have a confirmed
launch window..

1167
01:22:45,772 --> 01:22:47,145
- Give her your chair.
- Yes, sir.

1168
01:22:47,370 --> 01:22:50,730
We have a confirmed launch window for
friendship 7. Let's discuss a landing zone.

1169
01:22:51,460 --> 01:22:53,400
The Navy needs a singular landing zone.

1170
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:56,300
20 miles square is what we can
service for retrieval.

1171
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:59,310
Outside of that,
we risk the capsule's recovery.

1172
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:01,430
We'd like 3 possible recovery areas.

1173
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:03,500
We can't cover half the damn ocean.

1174
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,630
With all due respect,
our capsule's being altered daily.

1175
01:23:07,870 --> 01:23:10,040
We're orbiting the Earth at...
what's the speed now?

1176
01:23:16,430 --> 01:23:18,390
17,544 miles per hour.

1177
01:23:19,130 --> 01:23:22,060
At the time the rocket delivers the
capsule into low space orbit.

1178
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,470
That's one hell of a speeding ticket.

1179
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:32,379
OK.
So we have the vehicle's speed,

1180
01:23:32,380 --> 01:23:36,270
the launch window and for argument's sake,
the landing zone is The Bahamas.

1181
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:38,940
Should be enough to figure the Go/No Go?

1182
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:42,465
- Yeah! In theory, sir.
- We need to be past theory at this point.

1183
01:23:42,590 --> 01:23:45,254
We'll be able to calculate a
Go/No Go with that information.

1184
01:23:45,350 --> 01:23:47,150
When exactly is that gonna happen?

1185
01:23:58,680 --> 01:23:59,690
Katherine.

1186
01:24:01,890 --> 01:24:03,450
Have a go at it?

1187
01:24:28,820 --> 01:24:30,960
The Go point for re-entry

1188
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:34,730
is 2,990 miles

1189
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:37,210
from where we want Colonel Glenn to land.

1190
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:39,960
If we assume that's The Bahamas.

1191
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:45,630
At 17,544 miles per hour..

1192
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:47,440
Upon reentry..

1193
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:49,530
370..

1194
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:51,920
At a descent angle..

1195
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:54,450
Of 46.56 ..

1196
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:57,700
Degrees..
Distance..

1197
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,500
OK!
So, that puts the landing zone at...

1198
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:38,450
25.0667° North,

1199
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:41,220
77.3333° West.

1200
01:25:42,970 --> 01:25:44,200
Which is here

1201
01:25:47,650 --> 01:25:51,240
Right here.
Give or take 20 square miles.

1202
01:25:56,590 --> 01:25:57,820
I like her numbers.

1203
01:25:59,190 --> 01:26:00,220
Thank you.

1204
01:26:01,460 --> 01:26:05,720
That of course is assuming the ..
Capsule hits the reentry point exactly

1205
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:07,810
How do we insure that?

1206
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:11,160
That's the math we don't
have yet, gentlemen.

1207
01:26:11,530 --> 01:26:12,880
We're working on it.

1208
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:16,560
Katherine

1209
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:22,699
What's it gonna take to make
this thing worth the price tag?

1210
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:24,799
We're just getting up to speed here,
Mr. Harrison.

1211
01:26:24,823 --> 01:26:26,299
I need more man power.

1212
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:28,125
I mean Programmers.
Folks to feed the cards.

1213
01:26:28,150 --> 01:26:30,564
Then get them, for crying out loud.
Right?

1214
01:26:30,940 --> 01:26:32,980
- You're the IBM man, right?
- Yes, sir.

1215
01:26:32,990 --> 01:26:35,487
Pull them out of the sky if you
have to, but let's get ahead of

1216
01:26:35,512 --> 01:26:37,934
- this thing. Or I'm not paying you.
- Understood

1217
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:43,390
I got that one

1218
01:26:44,820 --> 01:26:46,420
I'm not paying any of you!

1219
01:26:56,140 --> 01:26:58,770
- Me?
- Temporarily. Yes.

1220
01:26:59,094 --> 01:27:01,094
We need the IBM for Glenn's launch.

1221
01:27:01,420 --> 01:27:04,570
The Lead Engineer says you're good
with the cards, programming and such.

1222
01:27:05,270 --> 01:27:06,598
What about the girls here?

1223
01:27:06,623 --> 01:27:10,504
Human computers can't calculate an
orbital flight in the time we have.

1224
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:14,380
- They'll stay put for now.
- What about after "now"?

1225
01:27:15,170 --> 01:27:19,940
After the Glenn launch, NASA's
dissolvin' the Computing Groups.

1226
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:24,320
I'm not accepting reassignment.

1227
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:25,980
Unless, I bring my ladies with me.

1228
01:27:27,250 --> 01:27:28,263
Excuse me?

1229
01:27:28,488 --> 01:27:30,925
We're going to need a lot of
manpower to program that beast.

1230
01:27:30,950 --> 01:27:33,380
I can't do it alone.
My girls are ready

1231
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:35,850
They can do the work.

1232
01:27:39,470 --> 01:27:44,330
Ladies!
We've been reassigned.

1233
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:48,460
Leave your calculators.
You won't need them where we're going.

1234
01:28:48,915 --> 01:28:50,875
Welcome, ladies!

1235
01:29:01,130 --> 01:29:02,940
Do you know what your job is, Paul?

1236
01:29:04,710 --> 01:29:06,850
To find the genius among those geniuses.

1237
01:29:07,030 --> 01:29:08,680
To pull us all up.

1238
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:14,210
We all get to the peak together,
or we.. Don't get there at all.

1239
01:29:17,510 --> 01:29:19,770
Yes. Well.
Good night, sir.

1240
01:29:49,030 --> 01:29:50,830
I don't know what time
I'm coming home.

1241
01:29:51,010 --> 01:29:52,650
The class ends at 9.

1242
01:29:56,020 --> 01:29:57,770
You got something to say?

1243
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:00,740
Thought you might need these.

1244
01:30:04,050 --> 01:30:06,410
You can refill ‘em with any weight
lead you want.

1245
01:30:07,370 --> 01:30:10,200
See, you just hit the top like this.

1246
01:30:11,860 --> 01:30:13,030
Lead comes out

1247
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:15,390
You put the new lead in..

1248
01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:18,690
And.. New pencil

1249
01:30:22,610 --> 01:30:24,560
You will make a fine engineer.

1250
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:28,060
- You think so?
- Yes.

1251
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:36,120
And nobody dare stand in the way of
Mary Jackson's dreams. Myself included.

1252
01:30:41,465 --> 01:30:44,465
- Don't make me mad again.
- Yes, ma'am.

1253
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:50,330
And don't make me late either.

1254
01:30:50,990 --> 01:30:52,450
You don't really want me to make you?

1255
01:31:00,750 --> 01:31:04,044
Hi, gentlemen.
Tonight we discuss Planck–Einstein.

1256
01:31:04,069 --> 01:31:05,994
Wavelength relationships..

1257
01:31:10,170 --> 01:31:11,250
Yes?

1258
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:15,800
I'm Mary Jackson.
I'm enrolled.

1259
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:21,000
Well. The curriculum is not designed
for teaching... a woman.

1260
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:23,640
Well, I imagine it's the same as
teaching a man.

1261
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:29,220
I don't see a colored section.
Should I just take any seat?

1262
01:31:34,868 --> 01:31:36,668
Thank you.

1263
01:31:41,060 --> 01:31:42,400
OK.

1264
01:31:43,590 --> 01:31:45,260
Planck–Einstein...

1265
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:52,120
The problem is when the capsule moves
from an elliptical orbit to a parabolic orbit.

1266
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:54,990
There's no mathematical formula for that.

1267
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:57,880
As we can calculate launch, landing

1268
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:01,830
but without this conversion, the capsule
stays in orbit, we can't bring it back home.

1269
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:06,530
Maybe we've been thinking about this
all wrong.

1270
01:32:06,690 --> 01:32:08,280
How's that?

1271
01:32:12,230 --> 01:32:14,060
Maybe it's not new math at all.

1272
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:17,550
It could be old math.

1273
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:21,790
Something that looks at the problem
numerically, and not theoretically

1274
01:32:22,700 --> 01:32:26,410
- Math is always dependable.
- For you it is.

1275
01:32:33,380 --> 01:32:34,540
Euler's Method.

1276
01:32:34,610 --> 01:32:36,420
- Euler's Method?
- Yes.

1277
01:32:36,420 --> 01:32:39,430
- That's ancient.
- But it works!

1278
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:41,690
It works numerically.

1279
01:33:17,660 --> 01:33:19,360
That's it!

1280
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:23,830
Let's type it up.

1281
01:33:48,945 --> 01:33:50,545
Dorothy.

1282
01:33:50,970 --> 01:33:52,670
Mrs. Mitchell.

1283
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:00,320
You're working late today?

1284
01:34:01,530 --> 01:34:03,520
Seems always happened that way

1285
01:34:03,850 --> 01:34:05,690
Yes.
Seems to.

1286
01:34:14,205 --> 01:34:15,605
Thank you.

1287
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:22,240
I hear the IBM is at full capacity.

1288
01:34:22,735 --> 01:34:24,435
You certainly have a knack for it

1289
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:27,430
My father taught me a thing or
two about mechanics.

1290
01:34:28,850 --> 01:34:33,070
You know, I have a few girls in the East Group
that have an interest in learnin' more about it.

1291
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:36,640
- It is the future.
- I may bring ‘em by, if it's all the same to you.

1292
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:41,600
That's not my decision. Ma'am.
That would be the supervisor's.

1293
01:34:43,124 --> 01:34:45,124
Yes. That's true.

1294
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:48,280
Well.
Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.

1295
01:34:50,410 --> 01:34:51,820
You know, Dorothy...

1296
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:58,420
Despite what you may think..
I have nothin' against ya'll.

1297
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:03,280
I know.
I know you probably believe that.

1298
01:35:16,125 --> 01:35:17,625
Goodnight, Katherine.

1299
01:35:18,450 --> 01:35:19,950
Good night!

1300
01:35:21,940 --> 01:35:24,530
- Mamma.
- Hey, baby

1301
01:35:24,550 --> 01:35:27,110
Hi!
Hey!

1302
01:35:28,710 --> 01:35:31,130
Please don't tell me I miss
someone's birthday

1303
01:35:31,154 --> 01:35:32,889
- No, you didn't
- No, you didn't, mamma

1304
01:35:32,890 --> 01:35:34,280
Madame...
Your seat.

1305
01:35:34,830 --> 01:35:39,360
Thank you
Well, is it my birthday?

1306
01:35:39,684 --> 01:35:41,384
No, mamma.

1307
01:35:42,130 --> 01:35:44,140
You're all look so pretty

1308
01:35:47,010 --> 01:35:48,870
Mamma,
What's going on?

1309
01:35:52,070 --> 01:35:53,270
Good evening, Katherine.

1310
01:35:58,980 --> 01:36:01,650
- So, you are not gonna say anything?
- It's not my place.

1311
01:36:04,260 --> 01:36:05,630
You, really?

1312
01:36:08,230 --> 01:36:10,130
Okay, I'm not going to do this all night...

1313
01:36:12,854 --> 01:36:14,854
Oh, mother of mercy.
That's for me?

1314
01:36:19,710 --> 01:36:20,830
Are you sad, Mamma?

1315
01:36:21,190 --> 01:36:24,430
- No! - It's okay, Mamma.
- He's a good man.

1316
01:36:24,430 --> 01:36:27,480
I know.
I know. I just. I can't help it.

1317
01:36:27,555 --> 01:36:29,055
He hasn't even asked you yet.

1318
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:33,620
I know, but he is..
You are, right?

1319
01:36:33,715 --> 01:36:35,115
If ya'll let me.

1320
01:36:35,140 --> 01:36:37,150
Go on. She's already crying.

1321
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:41,680
- This was my mother's ring.
- It is beautiful

1322
01:36:42,970 --> 01:36:46,160
- She and my father were married for..
- For 52 years.

1323
01:36:47,660 --> 01:36:49,930
I figure it's about as lucky as a ring
as you can get.

1324
01:36:51,590 --> 01:36:53,330
The day I met you, I called my mother...

1325
01:36:53,860 --> 01:36:57,040
I said: "Mom!
I met the woman I want to marry."

1326
01:36:57,064 --> 01:36:58,089
What'd she say?

1327
01:36:58,390 --> 01:37:00,890
She said: "She must be something,
Jimmy. Really something."

1328
01:37:00,914 --> 01:37:02,114
Then what'd you say?

1329
01:37:02,138 --> 01:37:07,938
I said: "No, She is more than Something,
She is Everything."

1330
01:37:11,150 --> 01:37:14,390
I planned on this being more romantic.
I'll make that up to you real soon.

1331
01:37:16,620 --> 01:37:20,770
But I know marrying you..
Includes me and the girls as well.

1332
01:37:22,850 --> 01:37:24,290
Amen to that.

1333
01:37:24,990 --> 01:37:26,100
I do.

1334
01:37:27,020 --> 01:37:29,050
- I didn't ask you yet.
- Hurry up!

1335
01:37:36,670 --> 01:37:39,880
No pain, please!
No, girls. No tears.

1336
01:37:44,020 --> 01:37:47,060
The Mercury Atlas Space vehicle,
which will putt John Glenn

1337
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:48,850
the first American into Earth orbit,

1338
01:37:49,180 --> 01:37:52,060
has already undergone 5 unmanned
flight tests.

1339
01:37:52,310 --> 01:37:56,909
NASA has confirmed that the
IBM 790 data processing

1340
01:37:56,934 --> 01:38:01,054
system has been utilized to confirm all of the
mission's long and recovery system calculations.

1341
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:04,880
The modifications and equipment installations
are progressing on the schedule.

1342
01:38:05,530 --> 01:38:06,470
Them, Here

1343
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:09,820
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Have a seat

1344
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:12,840
Is there something wrong, Mr. Harrison?

1345
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:14,290
No. There's nothing wrong.

1346
01:38:16,290 --> 01:38:19,510
In fact our IBM is churning out numbers
in fractions of the time any human can

1347
01:38:20,180 --> 01:38:21,830
Present company included.

1348
01:38:22,850 --> 01:38:24,320
That's good then.

1349
01:38:27,310 --> 01:38:28,730
Maybe.

1350
01:38:29,170 --> 01:38:32,460
The thing is, the Cape is now insisting on
doing all the backups down there. On site.

1351
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:35,490
I see.

1352
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:37,270
So, we won't be running backups here.

1353
01:38:38,780 --> 01:38:41,090
And truth be told, we can't keep up
with that IBM anyhow.

1354
01:38:44,930 --> 01:38:47,780
Long story short, we no longer need a..
Computer in this department.

1355
01:38:49,940 --> 01:38:51,810
Progress is a double edged sword.

1356
01:38:57,150 --> 01:38:59,467
Let's have you report back
to the West Group for now.

1357
01:38:59,492 --> 01:39:03,464
- I'll see if we can find another assignment.
- Thank you, sir.

1358
01:39:07,110 --> 01:39:11,500
Katherine, I'm..
I'm sorry about this

1359
01:39:13,330 --> 01:39:15,380
It's out of my hands, if you
can believe that.

1360
01:39:16,390 --> 01:39:17,880
I understand.

1361
01:39:41,610 --> 01:39:45,980
Katherine..
We heard you got engaged.

1362
01:39:46,420 --> 01:39:51,000
Yes.
That's thoughtful of you.

1363
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:59,990
- They're lovely.
- Mr. Harrison's idea really.

1364
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:02,700
Although I suspect his wife did
the picking out.

1365
01:40:03,660 --> 01:40:06,550
I can't imagine he has an eye
for anything but numbers..

1366
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:12,740
Now, you have a great wedding.
You did good work around here, Katherine.

1367
01:40:47,100 --> 01:40:50,140
I don't think I felt a thing
the first time I did this.

1368
01:40:50,380 --> 01:40:52,970
I was so nervous.

1369
01:40:54,050 --> 01:40:57,990
- This is as beautiful as you were back then.
- You think so?

1370
01:40:58,450 --> 01:41:00,040
Just a little older.

1371
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:04,040
And a little fuller...
But you look good.

1372
01:41:08,565 --> 01:41:10,465
Here we go. Again.

1373
01:41:20,490 --> 01:41:22,390
That'a girl

1374
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:29,079
.. And Colonel John Glenn will be
the first American to orbit the Earth.

1375
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:32,890
As you can see, there are thousands of
people here to witness this historic event

1376
01:41:34,570 --> 01:41:38,500
Paul, something's off here. These landing
coordinates don't match yesterday's.

1377
01:41:39,900 --> 01:41:42,290
The IBM just ran them.

1378
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:46,760
So then the IBM was wrong yesterday, right?

1379
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:49,310
Or the damn thing is wrong today.

1380
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:56,730
Paul, Am I right?
- It appears so.

1381
01:41:59,778 --> 01:42:02,078
The IBM has been spot on up to this point, John.

1382
01:42:02,102 --> 01:42:04,202
But we'll run it again,
to see what it comes up with.

1383
01:42:04,590 --> 01:42:08,260
I'll be honest with you, Al
When I fly, I fly the machine,

1384
01:42:08,584 --> 01:42:10,584
Right now, it seems like this machine
is flying me.

1385
01:42:11,130 --> 01:42:13,500
We're on the same page, John.
Our guys are on it.

1386
01:42:13,700 --> 01:42:15,770
Let's get the girl to check the numbers.

1387
01:42:15,940 --> 01:42:18,240
- The girl?
- Yes, sir.

1388
01:42:20,010 --> 01:42:22,840
- You mean Katherine?
- Yes, sir. The smart one.

1389
01:42:23,250 --> 01:42:25,630
If she says they're good,
I'm ready to go.

1390
01:42:26,860 --> 01:42:28,960
- All right. We'll get into it.
- Roger!

1391
01:42:31,260 --> 01:42:34,860
Sam!
Go find Katherine Goble.

1392
01:42:34,900 --> 01:42:38,510
She needs to verify Glenn's Go/No Go
or we're staying on the ground.

1393
01:42:38,580 --> 01:42:40,679
Yes, sir.

1394
01:43:03,690 --> 01:43:05,090
I'm looking for Katherine Goble

1395
01:43:05,150 --> 01:43:08,400
- It's Katherine Johnson now.
- They need you to verify these coordinates.

1396
01:43:18,410 --> 01:43:20,540
All right.
Give her some space to work.

1397
01:43:23,790 --> 01:43:26,120
A truly historic day for America..

1398
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:32,839
The country has waited for several months,
through many failed unmanned Atlas rocket tests

1399
01:43:32,840 --> 01:43:35,739
and 10 scheduled manned attempts,

1400
01:43:35,740 --> 01:43:40,039
which were canceled for various
mechanical or system complications.

1401
01:43:40,910 --> 01:43:46,950
All the final tests and checks are being conducted,
John Glenn is ready to board the Friendship 7.

1402
01:43:47,187 --> 01:43:49,120
But today we remain truly optimistic

1403
01:43:49,470 --> 01:43:51,265
and it's a go day in all regards

1404
01:43:52,109 --> 01:43:56,540
the capsule is ready, the rocket itself
is a OK, and the weather here at..

1405
01:43:57,385 --> 01:43:59,785
- Anything from Langley?
- Not yet.

1406
01:44:00,042 --> 01:44:04,331
We're being told the mission control at Nasa
is conducting a final check

1407
01:44:04,613 --> 01:44:08,973
of the launch and recovery coordinates
including the go/no-go calculations

1408
01:44:09,269 --> 01:44:11,823
so crucial to a safe and successful launch
and recovery

1409
01:44:12,220 --> 01:44:14,300
After years of waiting, and months of delays,

1410
01:44:14,900 --> 01:44:19,250
col. Glen is finally ready for that space flight
we've been waiting for with so much anticipation

1411
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:33,615
- We are still a go.
- Yes, sir.

1412
01:44:38,744 --> 01:44:40,344
That's it.

1413
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:46,430
What the devil are you doing?
Are you taking a break?

1414
01:45:33,485 --> 01:45:35,140
You have the time?

1415
01:46:06,665 --> 01:46:08,265
Sir.

1416
01:46:12,130 --> 01:46:13,930
Pad 14.

1417
01:46:25,450 --> 01:46:26,630
Katherine!

1418
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:33,730
Come on

1419
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:38,220
Sir, we've got Pad 14 on the box.

1420
01:46:38,390 --> 01:46:40,140
Alright, let me in there.

1421
01:46:43,140 --> 01:46:45,670
This is Langley.
We have the coordinates confirmed.

1422
01:46:46,094 --> 01:46:47,794
Standby, Langley.

1423
01:46:49,930 --> 01:46:53,350
We can confirm the Go/No Go
point for re-entry is..

1424
01:46:53,690 --> 01:47:05,290
16.11984 degrees latitude
- 165.2356 degrees longitude.

1425
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:09,720
The launch window is a go.
The landing coordinates match.

1426
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:11,940
That's very good news, Al.

1427
01:47:12,970 --> 01:47:15,570
It's a little hard to trust something
you can't look in the eyes.

1428
01:47:15,580 --> 01:47:18,570
That's right, Colonel.
Katherine did manage to calculate

1429
01:47:18,594 --> 01:47:21,194
a few decimal points further than that
hunk of metal.

1430
01:47:22,050 --> 01:47:25,270
Well, I'll take every digit ya got.
Be sure to thank her for me.

1431
01:47:25,370 --> 01:47:29,060
- Gentlemen! Let's launch this rocket.
- Good luck, Friendship 7.

1432
01:47:29,084 --> 01:47:30,829
God speed, Langley.

1433
01:47:33,930 --> 01:47:38,040
Here at Cape Canaveral the countdown
has resumed as Colonel John Glenn

1434
01:47:38,300 --> 01:47:43,070
is now aboard Friendship 7,
high above the Atlas rocket on Pad 14.

1435
01:47:43,640 --> 01:47:45,390
A height of over 93 feet ..

1436
01:47:47,330 --> 01:47:51,670
These pictures are from Cape Canaveral, Florida
Deck entry is now moving back.

1437
01:47:51,730 --> 01:47:52,810
We're go for launch.

1438
01:47:53,660 --> 01:47:56,460
The Mercury Spacecraft umbilical is out

1439
01:47:57,385 --> 01:47:59,085
T-10 seconds, and counting

1440
01:48:00,010 --> 01:48:03,740
8.. 7.. 6.. 5..

1441
01:48:03,830 --> 01:48:06,775
4.. 3.. 2..

1442
01:48:07,399 --> 01:48:10,299
1.. Zero.
Ignition.

1443
01:48:22,295 --> 01:48:24,045
It's getting bumpy along here.

1444
01:48:24,140 --> 01:48:26,335
Roger that.
You are in Max Q.

1445
01:48:26,359 --> 01:48:27,864
Roger that Capcom

1446
01:48:29,890 --> 01:48:31,985
Twenty seconds to SECO.

1447
01:48:32,009 --> 01:48:35,433
- The trajectory is still be "OK".
- Go for SECO.

1448
01:48:42,950 --> 01:48:45,610
Zero G. And I feel fine.

1449
01:48:45,634 --> 01:48:47,634
John Glenn reports everything looks good

1450
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:51,305
Oh, that view is tremendous.

1451
01:48:52,985 --> 01:48:55,475
Roger that, Friendship 7.

1452
01:49:00,465 --> 01:49:03,220
- You are go for orbit.
- Thank you, Capcom!

1453
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:12,420
All right. 10.5 hours to go.
If we make 7 round trips.

1454
01:49:13,940 --> 01:49:15,205
I could use a coffee.

1455
01:49:17,020 --> 01:49:20,320
Well, as we approach the end of day
here on the Eastern seaboard..

1456
01:49:20,690 --> 01:49:23,404
Colonel Glenn is just beginning
his third orbit.

1457
01:49:23,429 --> 01:49:26,244
Three quarters of the way
across the African continent.

1458
01:49:26,510 --> 01:49:30,780
We see he is currently over Zanzibar, which
is the next tracking station coming up.

1459
01:49:30,860 --> 01:49:32,950
Thankfully the Friendship 7 capsule is..

1460
01:49:41,490 --> 01:49:43,450
New assignment came down the pike.

1461
01:49:46,980 --> 01:49:51,260
Always changing round here.
It's hard to keep up.

1462
01:49:53,890 --> 01:49:56,680
Seems like they're gonna need
a permanent team to feed that IBM

1463
01:49:57,520 --> 01:50:00,600
- How big of a team?
- 30 to start.

1464
01:50:03,660 --> 01:50:05,830
Thank you for the information,
Mrs. Mitchell.

1465
01:50:07,170 --> 01:50:10,480
You're quite welcome... Mrs. Vaughan.

1466
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:57,410
We have a warning light!

1467
01:50:57,420 --> 01:50:59,430
Capcom 7,
I have a warning light.

1468
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:01,080
Standby, 7.

1469
01:51:01,530 --> 01:51:02,710
Sir, we have a warning light!

1470
01:51:06,990 --> 01:51:11,268
- What are we looking at, Paul?
- The heat shield may have come loose.

1471
01:51:11,293 --> 01:51:15,504
7, will you confirm the landing
bag is in the OFF position?

1472
01:51:15,950 --> 01:51:17,670
Affirmative, Capcom.

1473
01:51:18,180 --> 01:51:20,579
Al, we need to get him down, now
He could burn up on re-entry.

1474
01:51:30,180 --> 01:51:32,010
Come on, babies!

1475
01:51:32,130 --> 01:51:35,040
There's a man in space. We don't want to
miss it, so we gonna home.

1476
01:51:35,064 --> 01:51:36,289
Something's wrong with Glenn.

1477
01:51:36,290 --> 01:51:37,760
- Oh, my Goodness!
- What's going on?

1478
01:51:37,850 --> 01:51:40,190
- Let's go.
- Ya'll follow me.

1479
01:51:41,530 --> 01:51:46,860
We've just learned, the Friendship 7
is in danger of losing its heat shield.

1480
01:51:47,010 --> 01:51:50,880
Have you heard any banging noises?
Or anything of this type at higher rates?

1481
01:51:51,050 --> 01:51:52,430
That's a negative, Capcom.

1482
01:51:54,410 --> 01:51:56,088
Tell him not to jettison
the retro-package.

1483
01:51:56,413 --> 01:51:58,444
Tell him not to jettison
the retro-package.

1484
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:02,730
NASA is confirming there is some sort of
malfunction with the capsule's heat shield,

1485
01:52:02,755 --> 01:52:04,364
and it may not stay in place.

1486
01:52:04,690 --> 01:52:10,170
If the heat shield is loose... The retro-
package straps might hold it in place.

1487
01:52:10,250 --> 01:52:12,940
- Will that work?
- It will work.

1488
01:52:13,590 --> 01:52:17,150
It will hold it until he reaches the
Go /No Go point. It will work!

1489
01:52:18,630 --> 01:52:20,620
He has to override the 05g.

1490
01:52:21,420 --> 01:52:23,310
Do it.

1491
01:52:23,400 --> 01:52:24,596
Friendship 7...

1492
01:52:24,621 --> 01:52:29,283
We're recommending that the retro-package
NOT, I repeat, NOT be jettisoned.

1493
01:52:29,808 --> 01:52:33,670
This means that you will have
to override the 05g switch.

1494
01:52:33,730 --> 01:52:36,580
Roger!
Is there a reason for this? Over.

1495
01:52:37,350 --> 01:52:38,530
Standby, 7.

1496
01:52:43,330 --> 01:52:44,520
Not at this time, 7.

1497
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:49,850
Roger, that command.
I will make a manual 05g entry,

1498
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:52,710
and bring the scope in.
Over.

1499
01:52:56,300 --> 01:52:57,960
He knows.

1500
01:53:05,565 --> 01:53:08,016
Without a heat shield,
there's no way a Colonel Glenn

1501
01:53:08,041 --> 01:53:10,299
can get back through
the Earth's atmosphere.

1502
01:53:10,360 --> 01:53:14,635
The heat is simply too overpowering.
A malfunction in the automatic control system

1503
01:53:14,881 --> 01:53:17,942
is causing the spacecraft to yaw
in a skid like fashion

1504
01:53:18,539 --> 01:53:21,815
thus putting the Friendship 7's
re-entry point in jeopardy

1505
01:53:21,915 --> 01:53:25,815
even now, col. Glen is
skidding towards the US

1506
01:53:26,290 --> 01:53:28,330
and he must begin the retro sequence

1507
01:53:41,450 --> 01:53:44,865
You're going to be using
fly-by-wire for reentry.

1508
01:53:45,090 --> 01:53:47,573
You'll need to maintain a zero angle.
Over.

1509
01:53:47,950 --> 01:53:52,170
Roger. I'm on fly-by-wire,
back-it up with manual. Over.

1510
01:53:52,494 --> 01:53:53,879
Keep talking to him.

1511
01:53:53,880 --> 01:53:59,550
Roger. The weather in the recovery area:
3 foot waves, 10 miles visibility.

1512
01:54:00,540 --> 01:54:02,172
Capcom, you're going out

1513
01:54:02,197 --> 01:54:04,193
He's crossing the
communication black-out zone.

1514
01:54:07,218 --> 01:54:10,227
There's a real fireball outside,
and it's getting a little hot here!

1515
01:54:53,870 --> 01:54:55,910
Friendship 7.
Do you copy? Over.

1516
01:55:00,160 --> 01:55:01,340
Again.

1517
01:55:01,710 --> 01:55:03,800
Friendship 7.
Do you copy? Over.

1518
01:55:18,120 --> 01:55:20,180
Friendship 7. Do you copy? Over.

1519
01:55:33,620 --> 01:55:35,800
Loud and clear, Capcom.

1520
01:55:35,860 --> 01:55:38,359
Roger that.
How are you doing?

1521
01:55:40,060 --> 01:55:42,559
My condition is good.
But that was a real fireball, boy

1522
01:55:42,660 --> 01:55:45,760
Roger that.
Let's get you all the way home.

1523
01:55:45,830 --> 01:55:48,829
Roger that.
Here's hoping these landing coords still hold.

1524
01:55:48,930 --> 01:55:53,070
Approaching 16.11984.

1525
01:55:53,620 --> 01:56:01,710
- Roger that!
- Approaching -165.2356. In 3, 2, 1.

1526
01:56:01,750 --> 01:56:03,930
Engaging chutes.

1527
01:56:05,030 --> 01:56:08,329
Beautiful chutes.
How we're lookin, Capcom?

1528
01:56:08,530 --> 01:56:12,870
Your Go/No Go is good.
Landing coordinates are spot on, 7.

1529
01:56:13,780 --> 01:56:16,070
Roger that, Capcom.

1530
01:56:16,140 --> 01:56:18,939
I've always wanted to swim in
the Bahamas. Over.

1531
01:56:23,140 --> 01:56:26,650
John Glenn has splashed-down,
and is being recovered.

1532
01:56:29,430 --> 01:56:34,200
John Glenn has splashed-down safely
and is being recovered by USS Noa.

1533
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:40,760
Katherine!

1534
01:56:45,550 --> 01:56:49,270
- Nice work.
- You too, Mr. Harrison.

1535
01:56:50,550 --> 01:56:51,910
So..

1536
01:56:53,130 --> 01:56:55,329
You think we can get to the moon?

1537
01:56:57,030 --> 01:57:00,610
We're already there, sir.

1538
01:57:42,145 --> 01:57:46,339
Girls..... This is Mrs. Vaughan.
