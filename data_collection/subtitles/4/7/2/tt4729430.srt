1
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,381
<i>Letters.</i>

2
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:28,788
<i>You don't really write many these days,
do you?</i>

3
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:31,461
<i>But I bet there's one you never forget.</i>

4
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:34,458
<i>Send it off to a certain plump guy
in a red suit</i>

5
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:36,671
<i>and, provided
you've kept your act together</i>

6
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,750
<i>more or less,</i>

7
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:39,463
<i>he'll drop off a toy or two.</i>

8
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:42,041
<i>And yet, no one seems to wonder</i>

9
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,415
<i>how the whole thing
got started in the first place.</i>

10
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:48,955
<i>This is a story about letters,
and it began...</i>

11
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:51,125
<i>with this one.</i>

12
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:32,998
...74, 75, 76...

13
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:36,503
...77, 78, 79,

14
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:38,713
- 80!
- Drill Sergeant, sir!

15
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:41,671
All the way from the top!
Dispatch for one of your cadets!

16
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:45,206
It's for him, sir.

17
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:55,421
Cadet Johanssen!

18
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,210
Mmm-mmm-mmm!

19
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:58,211
Stop.

20
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:00,421
Don't tell me. Let me try to guess.

21
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,420
I give up. Who are you?

22
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,380
Sarge!

23
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,958
Drill Sarge! Have a seat.
Can I get you something to drink?

24
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:07,131
An espresso? A cappuccino?

25
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:10,458
Aren't you supposed to be
in equestrian training?

26
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:11,421
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

27
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,750
No worries.
I've got someone covering for me.

28
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:21,753
Dispatch
from the Postmaster General's Office!

29
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:22,673
What?

30
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,080
Sarge, is that for real?

31
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,996
Don't tease me now.

32
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:27,133
Here, hold these.

33
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,920
Ah, well, I was expecting this
a little bit sooner,

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,540
but, yup, summoned to the dragon's lair.

35
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:37,875
Go ahead and cancel
the Drill Sergeant's espresso, actually.

36
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,559
And, uh, here, why don't you finish mine?

37
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,184
I'm not gonna be needing it anymore...

38
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:44,668
...and I'm gonna take one last look
around the old place so I can forget it.

39
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,000
Mmm-hmm. Got it. All right, let's go.

40
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,830
Nine months.

41
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:57,246
It's been nine months
since I used every ounce of my influence

42
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,333
to get you into the Royal Postal Academy.

43
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:02,706
Actually, nine months and six days,
but who's counting?

44
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,331
What? No croutons?

45
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:06,166
Oh, man, come on!

46
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,500
Shall we take account
of your progress then?

47
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,173
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Definitely.

48
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,830
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir!

49
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,036
Sorting and filing:

50
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:16,671
<i>total failure.</i>

51
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,630
<i>Carrier pigeon care and handling...</i>

52
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,076
<i>...abysmal performance.</i>

53
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,626
<i>Transport of fragile merchandise...</i>

54
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,578
<i>...worst on record.</i>

55
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,166
Well, there you have it.

56
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,828
But, hey, we gave it the old college try,
didn't we?

57
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:34,035
Guess I'll just go pack up
and head home then. Too bad.

58
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,325
Darn, oh, darn.

59
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,326
- Stay right where you are.
- No, Dad!

60
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,748
You're right. When will I grow up?

61
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:43,043
When will I stop squandering
all these opportunities,

62
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,245
which you so kindly forced me into,

63
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,633
and become my own man?

64
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:50,498
I guess I must really hanker down
and rethink my priorities.

65
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:53,793
All wrapped up in my silk sheets
with some caviar and a sherry...

66
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,142
You still buy the same brand, right?

67
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,666
You think I'm just going to
watch you purposely fail

68
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,710
and then let you waltz right back

69
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:02,581
to a privileged life
void of any purpose or meaning?

70
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:05,416
Well, yeah. Where else would I...

71
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,290
Congratulations. You are now a postman.

72
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,915
Come again?

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,130
You are to establish
a working postal office in...

74
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,083
Smeerensburg.

75
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:28,915
You've got one year.

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,170
What? A year? Where? Smeerensburg?

77
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,930
What is...
What's happening right now? Dad?

78
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,788
Six thousand letters will suffice.

79
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,415
Stamped by your own hand.

80
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,130
And listen carefully, Jesper.

81
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:41,418
If you fail to get those letters,
you're cut off.

82
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,668
No more fancy apartments,

83
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,710
stagecoach, clothes, galas...

84
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,001
All gone.

85
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,883
You can look forward to
a cozy spot in the gutter.

86
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,578
- But...
- Six thousand letters, one year.

87
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,626
You can't cheat, bribe
or squirm your way out of this one.

88
00:04:57,125 --> 00:05:01,325
Dad! Come on!
It's me. Let's talk about this, man.

89
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:04,456
It's your son, Jesper! Little Jespie!

90
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:07,581
Remember, I...
"Daddy, can I help you mail the letters?

91
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:10,206
Can I help you put the medals
in the letters

92
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,081
and put them in a stamp with the..."

93
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:13,576
W-w-wait!

94
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,916
Do you know how long it took
to press this uniform?

95
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,960
I don't either,
but it took somebody hours.

96
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,041
Hello?

97
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:23,501
Burghard! Finally, a friendly face.
Can you believe what they...

98
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:27,043
Burghard, I'm not in the coach with you.
Burghard?

99
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:36,041
Sir,
I'm all for discipline, but Smeerensburg?

100
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,705
Isn't that a bit excessive?

101
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:43,415
That boy needs a wake-up call, Sergeant.
And who knows?

102
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:47,128
Someday he might even thank me for it.

103
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,251
Thank you, Dad!

104
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:52,583
This is really wonderful, Father.
Thank you so much.

105
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,376
This is great, Dad.

106
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,078
Really, really great.

107
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,245
Thanks, Dad!

108
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:03,713
Thank you!

109
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:06,211
I love this terrible coach ride.

110
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,541
Thank you so much!

111
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:10,245
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank...

112
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:31,785
You go back to the intersection.
You make a left at the dead tree.

113
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:32,875
You're welcome.

114
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,076
What? No. I'm not lost.

115
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,626
Trust me, you are.

116
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:39,378
Funny! Say, nice boat!

117
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,628
Any chance you might
actually get on it today?

118
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,826
What was that?

119
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:47,326
New postman. Smeerensburg.

120
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,746
Which is on an island,
which is surrounded by water,

121
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,083
which I need a boat to get to,
which you have.

122
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,456
Are we starting to connect the dots?

123
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,921
Is the weather always like this?

124
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,290
Eh. We're having a bit of a heat wave.

125
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,125
Huh?

126
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,460
There she is. Smeerensburg.

127
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Charming, huh?
Why, you should see it in the spring.

128
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:40,173
That's when those grays really pop.

129
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,416
What happened here?

130
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,960
Oh! Uh, colorful local traditions.
Quirky folklore. That kind of thing.

131
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:58,501
All part of this quaint town's
vibrant culture.

132
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,291
No, no! Why you...

133
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:07,035
Oh, you rotten vermin!

134
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:38,461
Where is everyone?

135
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:39,541
Everyone?

136
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,375
I thought there would be
some sort of a reception.

137
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:47,753
Oh! Right. Right, the reception.
Of course, the reception.

138
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:48,873
It's good you reminded me.

139
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:53,036
You just ring the bell over there and,
uh... and then the reception will start.

140
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,455
- The bell?
- Yep. Give it a go.

141
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:56,581
And they'll come out.

142
00:08:56,666 --> 00:09:01,206
Why, they'll have a band, hors d'oeuvres
and, uh... and the key to the city.

143
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,081
All that reception stuff.

144
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,246
Really?

145
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,753
- Out here?
- Why, of course!

146
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:11,463
Well, it's not every day they get
a brand-new postman from the big city.

147
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,920
Huh?

148
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:33,326
What's happening?

149
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,128
Whoa! Whoa!

150
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,328
Aah!

151
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,580
Ow, they're biting!
Ow, get off! Get off! Get off!

152
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,751
Isn't this nice?

153
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,423
And you thought they forgot.

154
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,000
Quick! Get me out of here!

155
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,328
- Uh...
- What's going on out here?

156
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,684
- Why is everybody just standing around?
- Well!

157
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:22,498
Look who's finally throwing in the towel!

158
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,213
Throwing in the... Us?

159
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,541
Ha! That's rich!

160
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,285
Admit it!
You weaseled out and rang the bell!

161
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:32,205
An Ellingboe? Never!
It was one of you critters!

162
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:33,392
Don't you dare raise your voice at me!

163
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:34,892
- Oh, there you go!
- You rang that bell!

164
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,142
You know you rang... Oh!

165
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,601
You chicken out,
and now you want to pin it on us!

166
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,351
- Unbelievable!
- We were plowing the snow...

167
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,745
Oh, whoa! Hey!

168
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,463
Huh. What've you got there, children?

169
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,711
Mine!

170
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,881
Pumpkin, show Daddy what you found.

171
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:53,461
Mine.

172
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
This is no way to treat a person!

173
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,293
Certainly not this person!

174
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,745
Just one second. Let me just...

175
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:02,753
A postman?

176
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,083
- Pfft. Give me a break.
- When will they learn?

177
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,956
Hey! They've sent us another postman!

178
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,286
All right. All right.

179
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:16,035
You don't know who I am,
so I'm gonna let this one slide.

180
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,995
Okay? But let's just say
I'm not really a postman.

181
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:22,253
Well, I am, because it's
our family business. My father's a...

182
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:25,101
- Don't get me started, because it's...
- Where were we? Oh, yeah. Bell, please!

183
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,684
Life is too short

184
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:29,668
to go into details, but...

185
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:43,076
Come to the counter.
I'll be right out.

186
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,166
All right, listen.

187
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:48,788
Whoever's there, I warn you,
you do not want to mess with me. Okay?

188
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,375
Holy mackerel! Oh, the smell!

189
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:54,128
Fresh out of mackerel.
Only herring and burbot today.

190
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:00,333
Oh.

191
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,670
Oh.

192
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,670
Uniform, cold sweat, scared stiff,
shaking in your boots.

193
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,420
All right, I'm gonna just
take a wild guess here.

194
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,130
You are the latest mailman,

195
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:14,418
and the ferryman tricked you
into ringing the Battle Bell.

196
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,830
The Battle Bell?
What kind of a town has a Battle Bell?

197
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:20,226
Can we open a window in here or something?
I can't pretend any...

198
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,380
Welcome to Smeerensburg,

199
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,918
home of the world's finest feuds.

200
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,330
Feuds?

201
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,076
Grudges, bickering,

202
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,666
the Krums versus the Ellingboes.

203
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,351
So...

204
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:35,495
...are you gonna buy something,
or are you just here to chitchat?

205
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,041
Wait.

206
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:41,251
Isn't this a school?
Shouldn't there be children and a teacher?

207
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,173
Oh! Yes! Oh, thank you! Thank you!

208
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,500
I knew I was forgetting something!
Children!

209
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:47,673
Thank you!

210
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:49,326
You're the teacher?

211
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:50,746
Okay, here's how it works.

212
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:53,476
I sell fish, and then the person
on the other side of the counter...

213
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,830
- That would be you. You buy...
- Holy moly! That's you?

214
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,960
What happened?

215
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,201
- What happened was...
- That's... That came out wrong.

216
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,290
I took a teaching job

217
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:05,375
at a place where people
don't send their kids to school!

218
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,434
Mingling with their sworn enemy's spawn?

219
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,208
Oh, no! We can't have that!

220
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:13,131
So, now I'm reduced to doing this
so I can get some money

221
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:17,378
and start fresh
somewhere far, far away from here.

222
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,666
Are you going to buy something?

223
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:22,828
Herring's on sale today.

224
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,750
Ah! There you are.
I wondered where you'd scurried off to!

225
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,253
Morning, Miss. Alva.

226
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,583
- Mogens.
- Come on, sport!

227
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,786
I saved the best for last!

228
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,003
Home sweet home.

229
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,213
Ow! What the...

230
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:47,381
- Mail that, postman!
- Now wait a minute, that's completely...

231
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:48,998
Go home, you loser!

232
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:52,923
Oh, yeah? Well, if I'm a loser,
then you're a, uh...

233
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,790
You're too far. You're gone.

234
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,826
Well, lots of nice, natural light,

235
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,786
rustic touches, central air
and panoramic views.

236
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,075
Perfect for animal lovers.

237
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,923
- Enjoy.
- Wait! Wait!

238
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,710
This can't be right! I...

239
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:19,326
Oh, I get it. Did my father
put you up to this? Good one.

240
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:20,916
Ha ha. You got me.

241
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,080
Okay, well, enough of that.
Show me where I'm really staying.

242
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,376
I'd like a hot bath
and a look at the dinner menu.

243
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,250
Here, let me help you out.

244
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,753
You're a postman in Smeerensburg,

245
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,753
which is on an island
cut off from the world,

246
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,213
frigid cold, angry, violent neighbors,

247
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,751
and this is home now.

248
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,293
Are we starting to connect the dots?

249
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,125
Aah!

250
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:47,998
Ugh.

251
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,495
Almost. Hang in there.

252
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:20,625
What?

253
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:42,631
Hmm?

254
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:43,708
Oh.

255
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,210
Aah!

256
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:51,038
That's it!
This place is the worst!

257
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:51,955
I'm going home!

258
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:54,211
No! You can't leave, remember?

259
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,421
You'll be broke! Out in the streets!

260
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,420
But I hate it here!

261
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,130
It's so cold and icky!

262
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,878
And the people are mean to me.
And I miss my silk sheets.

263
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,038
Shut up! Stop being weak!

264
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,205
Focus! How do you get out of here?

265
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,331
You need... You need...

266
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,036
letters!

267
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,125
Ugh.

268
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,416
All right. This is a good one.
I can feel it.

269
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,880
Come to Papa, you sweet, sweet little...

270
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,628
Oh, come on!

271
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,128
Ugh! Pssh!

272
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,455
Fine. Go to the source, I guess.

273
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,171
Good morning, madame.

274
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm the postman, obviously.

275
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,763
If you have letters you'd like me to send,

276
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:40,043
you could go scurry ahead
and get them and...

277
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,420
Hello! Hi! Hi!

278
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,101
If you have your letters on you,
I'd be glad to take them off your...

279
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:52,996
Hmph!

280
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,173
Birthday cards? Distant cousin?

281
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,250
Deceased notice?

282
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:57,541
Holy mother!

283
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:01,892
Any letters... or packages?

284
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:02,746
Any packages?

285
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,793
Come on, people!

286
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,785
Letters! Letters! I don't have all day!

287
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,916
Okay, keep low. Don't panic. Don't panic.

288
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,830
Oh, I guess that's why
they call it "snail mail."

289
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,503
All right. What's going on here?
Where are all the letters?

290
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:23,173
Oh. Folks around here only have
one thing to say to one another.

291
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,173
Ah.

292
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,040
And they're getting their point across
pretty well without mail.

293
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,745
- Wouldn't you say?
- Wait, wait, wait.

294
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:33,423
No letters?
But how am I supposed to get out of...

295
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,166
- What the...
- Hello?

296
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,750
Sir, can I get my drawing back?

297
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,293
The wind blew it away.

298
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,495
- Please?
- Not now, kid.

299
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:45,583
Can't you see I'm busy
trying to figure out how to get...

300
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,920
Well, here's a thought.

301
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,290
I'm a postman, see?

302
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:53,455
So I can't give it to you,
but I could mail it to you.

303
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:55,211
- How?
- Couldn't be simpler!

304
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:58,831
I just fold your pretty drawing,
very beautiful by the way,

305
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,576
put it in an envelope like this

306
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:04,456
and then all that's left is postage
so I can put it in the mailbox for you.

307
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,330
- Postage?
- Yep.

308
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:09,416
You just toss a penny over to me
so I can stamp it,

309
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,880
and we're all ready to go.

310
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,458
Couldn't you just put it in?

311
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,291
Aw. Tsk.

312
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:19,625
I really, really would, but I can't.

313
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:22,458
It's not a letter
if it doesn't have postage.

314
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:23,541
See how it works?

315
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
So what do you say?

316
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:27,211
I get my letter, and you get your drawing.

317
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,461
Win-win. You want your drawing, don't you?

318
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,142
- Um...
- If you don't, I'm gonna keep it.

319
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,456
- Hmm.
- I love it.

320
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:33,701
I would keep it if I was you,

321
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,000
so I would send this letter
back to myself if I was you.

322
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,575
Oh, hi, Papa!

323
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,576
This nice man says
he can mail my drawing back to me!

324
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:45,142
- He's lying. Children are liars.
- Can you give him a penny?

325
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,286
Oh, look at that. Wrong address. Silly me.

326
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,165
These aren't...
You're not the Spendlebergs.

327
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,250
I'll see you later.

328
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,053
Thank you so much,
and no need...

329
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,601
Aah! The puppies! The puppies!

330
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:57,665
Ah. And that must be the express mail.

331
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,278
All right, Smeerensburg.

332
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,673
You may have won this round,

333
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,080
but if you think I'm giving up,
think again.

334
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,626
I'll have my letters in no time,

335
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:08,208
and then it's bye-bye to you
and your cold and your loons

336
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:09,767
and your chickens! That's right! You too!

337
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,420
You'll see. I give it a week.

338
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,080
Two, tops.

339
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:40,075
Is this a bad time?
I can see you're pretty swamped.

340
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:44,536
Don't you have...

341
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,961
a job or something?

342
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,291
Why, sure I do.

343
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:51,575
I'm here to pick up all the outgoing mail.

344
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:52,826
So, where is it?

345
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:55,101
Now, you're gonna have to help me
with the heavier bags.

346
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,165
Bad back, don't you know.

347
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,750
- Man, I hate you.
- I know.

348
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,423
So, uh, where is the mail, anyway?

349
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,170
Where do you keep it?
In a different room now or something?

350
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,290
What about if I walk around the room,

351
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:10,325
if I get close to the mail,
you say "warmer"?

352
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:15,126
And if I'm getting
farther from the mail, you say "colder"?

353
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:16,878
- And then...
- What's that?

354
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,208
What? Oh, the woodsman's cabin?

355
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,171
Yeah, does someone live there?

356
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,130
Well, sure.
Yeah, you should definitely drop by.

357
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:27,248
Nice fella. Loves visitors.

358
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:56,711
Hello? I'm in your house
or... whatever this place is.

359
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:57,881
Anybody here?

360
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,745
Ah, come on. Really?

361
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,920
Of course. Of course this would happen.

362
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:21,751
Great. I'm gonna kill that boatman.

363
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
What?

364
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:33,666
Toys?

365
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:39,208
Ah, here we go.

366
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:50,883
Now I can go home with the satisfaction
of having accomplished absolutely...

367
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:54,538
Aah!

368
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:19,423
Aah!

369
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,205
Aah!

370
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:04,083
Yeehaw!

371
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:18,128
That's it! I've had it!

372
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:20,578
Better alive in the gutter
than hacked into pieces!

373
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:21,916
No, thank you!

374
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Yah!

375
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:41,921
Please don't chop me up
and scatter my parts in the woods!

376
00:25:47,958 --> 00:25:49,078
Where's this?

377
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:51,376
What? I don't know. How would I...

378
00:25:51,458 --> 00:25:52,458
Wait.

379
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:54,125
I do know.

380
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:56,828
Keep going down this road,
and you'll get there.

381
00:25:56,916 --> 00:25:58,996
You can't miss it. It...
Or I can show you.

382
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:01,173
Sure. Yeah, let me just show you.

383
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:12,131
All right.

384
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:14,578
Excuse me. Just... Can I...

385
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:17,253
Here we are.

386
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:19,963
Watch your step getting out of the, uh...
What's this?

387
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:22,705
You're a postman, aren't you?

388
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:25,458
Oh, you want me to...

389
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:27,291
No, but I...

390
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:31,248
Sure thing. My pleasure.

391
00:26:31,916 --> 00:26:32,996
Nothing I'd love to do more

392
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:38,173
than deliver what I'm fairly certain
can only be a severed head of some kind.

393
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:40,142
I mean, there's no way
that's not a severed head.

394
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:42,876
It's gotta... I'm holding a head
in my hand, but hey!

395
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:46,035
Come on! Look, I'm...

396
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:47,785
Ah! You're right there!

397
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:50,665
So quiet for a disproportionately...

398
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,580
I mean, strapping, uh... statuesque.

399
00:26:53,666 --> 00:26:55,536
You have a kind of, um...

400
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,710
What? In there?

401
00:27:00,791 --> 00:27:03,081
You must be kidding.
No way. Absolutely not.

402
00:27:03,166 --> 00:27:05,126
I mean, first of all,
I'd love to, of course,

403
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:07,078
but, look, too bad about the fence.

404
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:08,626
Rats. Oh, well.

405
00:27:08,708 --> 00:27:11,108
What are you gonna do? Are you...
What's happening right now?

406
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,080
Hey, listen, please. Open this!

407
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:16,416
Why are you doing this to me?

408
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,500
Oh, no.

409
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:25,141
Okay, you win. What do you want?
Money? My dad's got plenty of it.

410
00:27:25,166 --> 00:27:27,142
You can write him a ransom note.
You can write, right?

411
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:28,926
Oh, it doesn't matter.
I'll write it for you.

412
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:32,673
Ah! He'll never know it's me!
I'll make it sound like it's from you!

413
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:35,170
I'll use monosyllabic words, man!
Please! Please! Please!

414
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,170
Just let me out of here!
I'm gonna get...

415
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,880
Why?

416
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:45,130
Ow! Ow!

417
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:46,578
Who's there?

418
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:54,423
Aah!

419
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,170
Door, door, door.

420
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:01,038
Locks!

421
00:28:02,291 --> 00:28:04,381
This has gotta move! Come on! Come on!

422
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:08,208
Open up. Open up. Open up! Come on!

423
00:28:08,291 --> 00:28:09,541
Come on! Come on! Come on!

424
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:13,753
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Keep it together! Keep it together!

425
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Aah!

426
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:25,793
Where are they, boys?

427
00:28:25,875 --> 00:28:28,625
Don't let 'em get away! Come on! Get 'em!

428
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:29,828
Okay.

429
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,786
I've done all you've asked. Can I please...

430
00:28:43,375 --> 00:28:44,375
Hmm.

431
00:30:14,916 --> 00:30:15,746
Has he?

432
00:30:15,833 --> 00:30:18,253
Ah! He's here to finish the job!

433
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:20,213
- Oh, no!
- Mr. Postman?

434
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,040
Are you in there?

435
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:24,998
Go away! Go! Leave! He'll hear you!

436
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:28,205
We'd like to send these letters!

437
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,291
What? What did you just say?

438
00:30:36,375 --> 00:30:39,875
Our cousin told us
if we write a letter to Mr. Klaus,

439
00:30:39,958 --> 00:30:40,998
he'll make us a toy.

440
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:43,383
He also said to bring you a penny each.

441
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:46,748
It's not a letter
if it doesn't have postage, right?

442
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,580
- Psst. Hey. Hey, you.
- Hmm?

443
00:30:59,666 --> 00:31:00,666
You want a toy?

444
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,960
Hey! Would you, uh...

445
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:08,041
like a brand-new toy?

446
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:11,246
Just write a letter to Mr. Klaus.

447
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:17,170
And you put it in the envelope,
write your name on it and bring a penny.

448
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,330
Can't forget the penny.

449
00:31:35,541 --> 00:31:37,671
These better sound sad. Do they sound sad?

450
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,250
Okay, good job.

451
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:47,958
All right. And now...

452
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:49,705
<i>for the tricky part.</i>

453
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,880
All right. Remember...

454
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:27,578
probably not an ax murderer, though...

455
00:32:28,166 --> 00:32:30,916
it still is a possibility,
but most likely... no.

456
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:33,461
He's a good guy... deep down.

457
00:32:34,416 --> 00:32:36,416
Hello.

458
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:40,130
Hello.
Mr... Klaus, I take it?

459
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:43,458
You remember me from the nice
breaking and entering last night?

460
00:32:43,541 --> 00:32:45,541
Jesper Johanssen, postman,

461
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:48,205
but we never properly...

462
00:32:48,291 --> 00:32:50,081
Uh...

463
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:51,745
I, uh...

464
00:32:51,833 --> 00:32:56,213
You see, Mr. Klaus,
it seems like word got around

465
00:32:56,291 --> 00:33:00,171
that the poor children of Smeerensburg
have started, uh...

466
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,790
completely unprompted...

467
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:04,375
writing letters asking you for...

468
00:33:06,041 --> 00:33:07,461
toys.

469
00:33:08,041 --> 00:33:09,211
So I figured

470
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:11,831
you have the whole barn filled with toys

471
00:33:11,916 --> 00:33:14,576
just sitting there collecting dust, so...

472
00:33:18,291 --> 00:33:21,131
Oh, God. Okay. This is it. Here it goes.

473
00:33:32,666 --> 00:33:35,456
Oh, wow.

474
00:33:35,541 --> 00:33:37,211
That is...

475
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:39,955
totally normal.

476
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:42,461
Not a symptom of any mental illness
or anything.

477
00:33:42,541 --> 00:33:44,751
- Go away.
- Mr. Klaus, sir!

478
00:33:44,833 --> 00:33:46,923
Those little children...

479
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,540
...if you donate your old toys to them...

480
00:33:49,625 --> 00:33:52,825
...well,
I'll gladly deliver them for free!

481
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:00,495
Mr. Klaus, wait!

482
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:03,376
Please!

483
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,788
Think of all the joy you'll bring
their miserable little lives!

484
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:08,708
Look, here.

485
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:10,213
Poor little Herlief.

486
00:34:10,291 --> 00:34:13,211
He only has sticks and stones
to play with. So sad.

487
00:34:13,291 --> 00:34:14,711
And this one,

488
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:17,001
little Penny... Patty.

489
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:19,003
Her doll was so old,

490
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:21,713
it crumbled in her arms
when she came to me.

491
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:24,541
And then Kristoff...
Little, ugly Kristoff.

492
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:26,333
This little...

493
00:34:33,208 --> 00:34:34,628
Tonight, same time.

494
00:34:35,916 --> 00:34:39,786
Great! What, "same time"?
You mean, dead of night?

495
00:34:39,875 --> 00:34:42,165
- I can just take the toys now.
- No. I go with you.

496
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,460
There's no need
for you to come with me, really.

497
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:45,881
It might be against the law

498
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:48,878
for a noncertified postman
to ride with me.

499
00:34:48,958 --> 00:34:50,288
I have to check the rule book.

500
00:34:50,875 --> 00:34:54,285
Great. Tonight, then. I'll see you then.
Good talk. Good talk.

501
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:27,293
Whoa! Whoo!

502
00:35:28,791 --> 00:35:29,631
Huh?

503
00:35:33,625 --> 00:35:35,495
Oh, oh!

504
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:40,670
Playing!

505
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,580
Playing, I tell you.

506
00:35:42,666 --> 00:35:43,996
With an Ellingboe!

507
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:46,476
- An Ellingboe, no less!
- In all my years!

508
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,500
- Did you all hear that?
- Unacceptable.

509
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:50,059
I don't know how it happened.

510
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:52,333
I turned away for one second...

511
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,000
And then I saw it.

512
00:35:56,083 --> 00:35:58,133
I brought her as soon as I could, sir.

513
00:35:58,208 --> 00:36:00,458
- That's just wrong! Wrong, I say!
- Inconceivable!

514
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:02,631
- What are we going to do?
- Unthinkable!

515
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:05,328
Hmm. This is bad. Very bad.

516
00:36:05,416 --> 00:36:08,536
Worst I've ever seen, really.
What were you thinking, kid?

517
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:09,625
Don't you know that...

518
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:12,876
Krums and Ellingboes don't mix.

519
00:36:13,541 --> 00:36:15,381
- But why?
- "Why?" he asks!

520
00:36:15,458 --> 00:36:16,976
- See what I mean?
- Why?

521
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,170
I don't know what to do!

522
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:21,130
Please help us, miss! I beg you!

523
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,420
Do you know what this is, little boy?

524
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:36,825
This is tradition!

525
00:36:36,916 --> 00:36:42,916
Centuries of glorious hatred,
passed down through generations!

526
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,830
There was the hundred-day brawl of '45.

527
00:36:45,916 --> 00:36:47,496
Which we totally won!

528
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:49,503
The maritime game of chicken.

529
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:52,293
The Great Mooning of '86.

530
00:36:54,458 --> 00:36:56,578
So, if there's something we know...

531
00:36:56,666 --> 00:36:59,246
...going back as far as we can remember...

532
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:01,833
...it's that a Krum
despises an Ellingboe...

533
00:37:01,916 --> 00:37:05,456
...and an Ellingboe can't stand a Krum!

534
00:37:09,958 --> 00:37:11,878
That is why.

535
00:37:12,958 --> 00:37:19,958
Now, I just know you didn't mean to
disrespect all of that heritage, right?

536
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:23,131
- Right.
- And it won't happen again,

537
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:24,538
will it?

538
00:37:25,541 --> 00:37:27,131
Of course not.

539
00:37:27,666 --> 00:37:30,916
Now, tell me all about
where this pretty thing came from.

540
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:36,625
Ugh.

541
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:40,578
Let me guess.
Leaving it at the gate not an option?

542
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:45,333
You really have a way with words,
you know?

543
00:37:46,291 --> 00:37:49,081
Of course, you don't...
Of course, don't even answer that...

544
00:37:52,958 --> 00:37:54,538
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

545
00:37:57,083 --> 00:37:58,383
Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no!

546
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:02,883
Stop, stop, stop!

547
00:38:02,958 --> 00:38:04,538
Stop! Stop!

548
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:06,750
Aah!

549
00:38:38,791 --> 00:38:39,961
Whoa! Whoa!

550
00:38:41,416 --> 00:38:43,496
You rotten vermin!

551
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:49,053
- Me, me, me!
- Pick me!

552
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:50,351
- Out of the way!
- Mine first!

553
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:51,415
I want a bicycle!

554
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,142
- Tell Mr. Klaus I want a bicycle!
- Shut up!

555
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:54,926
- Take my letter! Take my letter!
- Mine! Me!

556
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,878
Me first! Me first! A doll!

557
00:38:56,958 --> 00:39:00,458
{\an8}-Me! Me! Me!
- Okay! Okay! Single line! Chop-chop!

558
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:02,791
Fall back! All right. Everyone, in line.

559
00:39:02,875 --> 00:39:04,059
- There you go.
- Get out! Move.

560
00:39:04,083 --> 00:39:07,003
Letter? Good. Letter? Good.

561
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:09,213
Got it. Get out of here.
Great. Move along.

562
00:39:14,208 --> 00:39:18,378
- What's wrong with her mouth?
- She's not from here. She's Saami.

563
00:39:22,166 --> 00:39:26,286
Right, that's nice. But I see no letter,
so please come back when you have one.

564
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:27,375
Have a nice day.

565
00:39:27,458 --> 00:39:29,418
Bye-bye. Okay, any other letters?

566
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,642
- Here! Here! Here!
- Me, me, me!

567
00:39:30,666 --> 00:39:32,416
Good. The rest, you know the deal.

568
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,790
No letter, no toy.

569
00:39:33,875 --> 00:39:35,825
But we don't know how to write.

570
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,205
Tough luck, kid.

571
00:39:39,291 --> 00:39:41,331
Wait, you know what you could do?

572
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:57,165
- What are you doing?
- Aah!

573
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:59,630
Telling children to go to school
to learn to write?

574
00:39:59,708 --> 00:40:00,578
What is wrong with you?

575
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:02,286
Yeah, yes. What I meant to do...

576
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:03,601
Listen to me, Postman.

577
00:40:03,625 --> 00:40:06,075
Whatever you're doing, leave me out of it.

578
00:40:06,166 --> 00:40:08,826
I have been rotting away here
for five years,

579
00:40:08,916 --> 00:40:10,326
and I am so close to getting out.

580
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:12,076
I am not about to let you mess it all up.

581
00:40:12,666 --> 00:40:13,536
You got it?

582
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:17,035
These children wasting away
without a proper education?

583
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:18,125
I mean...

584
00:40:19,541 --> 00:40:22,881
Forgive me, I'm kind of a dreamer, but...
isn't that why we do it?

585
00:40:22,958 --> 00:40:24,038
Hmm? Hmm?

586
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:25,955
Why you became a teacher?

587
00:40:26,041 --> 00:40:27,671
So you could make a difference?

588
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:34,458
Ah. Young love.

589
00:40:34,541 --> 00:40:35,671
Takes me back, you know?

590
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:39,250
The intense looks,
the palpitation of the heart.

591
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:41,753
The whimpering
and the soiling of the pants, no.

592
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:43,293
I can't relate to so much.

593
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,830
So you go to sleep,
and when you wake up in the morning,

594
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:52,706
the present is right there
by the fireplace!

595
00:40:52,791 --> 00:40:54,961
Yeah, Mr. Klaus is amazing!

596
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:57,081
- Yeah, he's awesome.
- Yeah!

597
00:40:57,166 --> 00:40:59,166
"Klaus"? "Awesome"?

598
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:02,130
He's huge,
but he can squeeze down any chimney!

599
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,878
- Really? How?
- I don't know.

600
00:41:03,958 --> 00:41:04,958
Magic, I guess.

601
00:41:05,041 --> 00:41:06,671
Ow!

602
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:09,666
There.

603
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,000
Ugh.

604
00:41:11,083 --> 00:41:13,003
If you leave your socks
hanging on the mantle,

605
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:15,383
Mr. Klaus will fill them with toys!

606
00:41:17,916 --> 00:41:19,916
<i>He only comes when you're sleeping.</i>

607
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,750
No one has ever seen him.

608
00:41:21,833 --> 00:41:24,293
<i>It's like he's invisible or something.</i>

609
00:41:26,041 --> 00:41:27,381
Aah!

610
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:31,826
<i>Oh, and he likes cookies.</i>
<i>Don't forget to leave out some cookies.</i>

611
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:51,875
Go home, you loser!

612
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:54,208
Hmm.

613
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,670
Who's the loser now, you little brat?

614
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:02,710
Mr. Klaus is the coolest.

615
00:42:02,791 --> 00:42:04,541
Hey, have you heard about Klaus?

616
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:06,425
His name is Klaus,
and he makes the best toys.

617
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:08,418
- Klaus.
- Klaus.

618
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,630
- Klaus.
- He's awesome.

619
00:42:09,708 --> 00:42:10,828
His toys are the best.

620
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,578
- What happened?
- Not a word.

621
00:42:26,125 --> 00:42:28,535
You just sit there,
be all magical and awesome.

622
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:32,125
What?

623
00:42:37,416 --> 00:42:40,076
Are we going to learn something today?

624
00:42:42,625 --> 00:42:45,825
Look, if you have to be here,
at least be quiet.

625
00:42:45,916 --> 00:42:48,326
Why don't you go ahead and just,
I don't know,

626
00:42:48,416 --> 00:42:50,076
write vowels or something?

627
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:51,626
We don't have notebooks.

628
00:42:51,708 --> 00:42:52,708
Or pens.

629
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,392
All right. Okay, let's make a deal.

630
00:42:55,416 --> 00:42:58,916
if I teach you something,
will you get out of here? Please?

631
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,210
Mmm-hmm.

632
00:43:13,416 --> 00:43:14,876
There you go.

633
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:18,130
Really? That's my name?

634
00:43:18,708 --> 00:43:20,418
Yes. Yay, it's your name.

635
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,880
Wow.

636
00:43:22,416 --> 00:43:23,536
Can you teach me more?

637
00:43:23,625 --> 00:43:25,575
- Please?
- Me next!

638
00:43:25,666 --> 00:43:28,059
- I want to write my name.
- Me too. I want to write my name.

639
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:30,503
- Pick me!
- I want to write my name!

640
00:43:30,583 --> 00:43:32,583
- Me too! I want to write my name!
- Teach me!

641
00:43:32,666 --> 00:43:34,626
- I want to write my name!
- Me next!

642
00:43:53,416 --> 00:43:54,416
Too heavy.

643
00:43:54,875 --> 00:43:55,745
Okay, then.

644
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:58,173
I can go by myself. You don't have to...

645
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:02,630
I mean, no offense, but someone could use
a little diet cleanse. What are you doing?

646
00:44:03,916 --> 00:44:06,206
Less presents, less weight.

647
00:44:06,291 --> 00:44:07,291
Less presents?

648
00:44:07,333 --> 00:44:11,293
But less presents means less letters,
and less letters means less...

649
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:16,625
more children's dreams being shattered.

650
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:20,125
No. No, no, no, I won't allow it.

651
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:22,918
We have a sworn duty for the children.

652
00:44:31,458 --> 00:44:32,458
Aah!

653
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Gotcha!

654
00:44:47,375 --> 00:44:48,375
Aah!

655
00:44:48,875 --> 00:44:51,875
Hmm.

656
00:45:00,041 --> 00:45:01,961
Come here! Come on!

657
00:45:02,041 --> 00:45:03,831
Aah! Ow! Ow!

658
00:45:25,958 --> 00:45:29,248
Right. I wear them down,
and you catch them.

659
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:31,383
Good teamwork... Whoa! Whoa!

660
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:39,745
- Waah! Whoo!
- Whoa ho ho!

661
00:45:39,833 --> 00:45:41,173
- Whoo hoo hoo!
- Whoa ho ho!

662
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:44,684
- That's right.
- Good call, reindeer.

663
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:45,538
This is good teamwork here.

664
00:45:45,625 --> 00:45:47,906
- We're making good time.
- Reliable, strong, cooperative.

665
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:55,083
Okay, post office is now officially open.

666
00:45:55,166 --> 00:45:56,706
You have your letters, step right in.

667
00:45:56,791 --> 00:45:58,671
Thank you. Thank you.

668
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:00,460
Hey, loser!

669
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:01,631
What gives?

670
00:46:01,708 --> 00:46:05,458
I sent my letter,
and all I got was a lousy clump of coal!

671
00:46:05,541 --> 00:46:06,711
Well, it serves you right!

672
00:46:06,791 --> 00:46:09,541
Devilish little tadpoles like yourself
don't get toys from Klaus.

673
00:46:09,625 --> 00:46:13,245
Oh, yeah? And how would he know
what I'm up to unless you ratted on me?

674
00:46:14,916 --> 00:46:16,286
Oh, I didn't have to.

675
00:46:17,416 --> 00:46:18,706
He knows.

676
00:46:21,208 --> 00:46:22,328
What do you mean?

677
00:46:22,416 --> 00:46:24,876
He sees everything, you know.

678
00:46:25,416 --> 00:46:28,126
Every mischief, prank and dirty deed.

679
00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:30,708
He keeps a list. The...

680
00:46:32,208 --> 00:46:35,918
- Naughty List, he calls it.
- You lie!

681
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Trust me.

682
00:46:37,541 --> 00:46:39,881
You do not want to be on the Naughty List.

683
00:46:42,541 --> 00:46:45,921
So, you still wanna throw that snowball?

684
00:46:49,166 --> 00:46:51,076
I didn't think so.

685

686
00:46:58,708 --> 00:47:01,788

<i>♪ That's what you get
When you mess with the postman ♪</i>

688

- Ow!
<i>- ...and he hurt his leg.</i>

699
00:47:45,625 --> 00:47:47,325
<i>- It must've really hurt...</i>
- Let go of me!

700
00:47:47,416 --> 00:47:50,666
<i>- ...'cause he would not stop screaming.</i>
- I'm being attacked by Ellingboes! Help!

701
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:52,000
<i>So we helped him.</i>

702
00:47:52,083 --> 00:47:55,833
<i>He said he didn't like it,
but... deep down, I think he did."</i>

703
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:57,601
<i>"That's what I did today.</i>

704
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:58,745
<i>And yesterday,</i>

705
00:47:58,833 --> 00:48:02,383
<i>instead of stealing Mrs. Runa's berries,
we picked them all up for her."</i>

706
00:48:02,458 --> 00:48:03,668
Hmm?

707
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:07,670
<i>"She came to our house later,
and she brought Mom lots of berry jam."</i>

708
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:09,000
Hmph.

709
00:48:09,083 --> 00:48:11,583
<i>"And then</i>
<i>Mom brought her a berry pie."</i>

710
00:48:11,666 --> 00:48:13,226
- <i>"Dear Mr. Klaus...</i>
- Hmph.

711
00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:14,881
<i>...I've been going to class every day,</i>

712
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:17,998
<i>- and I always do my homework."</i>
- Oh, Annelisse! Thank you!

713
00:48:20,458 --> 00:48:22,038
Hi, Mr. Postman!

714
00:48:22,125 --> 00:48:24,825
<i>"Miss. Alva</i>
<i>is the best teacher ever!"</i>

715
00:48:24,916 --> 00:48:28,076
<i>"Also, I cleaned</i>
<i>my dad's old clarinet.</i>

716
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:31,956
<i>I hope I did a good job. He seemed happy.</i>

717
00:48:32,583 --> 00:48:34,633
<i>Could I get a toy please?"</i>

718
00:48:42,041 --> 00:48:43,041
Huh?

719
00:48:45,083 --> 00:48:45,923
Huh?

720
00:48:55,583 --> 00:48:56,583
What?

721
00:48:59,291 --> 00:49:00,331
What the...

722
00:49:16,166 --> 00:49:17,642
Hey, there, Chief. How're we doin'...

723
00:49:17,666 --> 00:49:20,126
- Here! Me!
- What? How?

724
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:31,543
Whoo! Come on, guys! Let's play!

725
00:50:07,083 --> 00:50:11,833
I think it's time we send
that postman... a message.

726
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:15,670
You know what to do, pumpkin.

727
00:50:16,416 --> 00:50:19,376
Mine...

728
00:50:20,208 --> 00:50:23,828
And the baker now has a sale
on cakes for Ellingboes,

729
00:50:23,916 --> 00:50:25,876
without razor blades in the dough
or anything.

730
00:50:25,958 --> 00:50:30,288
Oh, and did you know
that arson is down 70%?

731
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:32,915
It's true. When's the last time
you saw a house burn down?

732
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Precisely. And cookouts,
swap meets, and, uh...

733
00:50:36,083 --> 00:50:36,963
yeah, I don't know.

734
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:39,001
It's like everyone's gone mad
or something.

735
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,790
A true selfless act...

736
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:44,791
always sparks another.

737
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:48,995
Well, look who's suddenly a chatterbox.
Tell me,

738
00:50:49,083 --> 00:50:51,883
what made you squander all those words
into that nugget of wisdom?

739
00:50:51,958 --> 00:50:54,248
Oh, just something...

740
00:50:54,833 --> 00:50:56,083
someone used to say.

741
00:50:56,166 --> 00:50:57,626
Well, let me tell you something.

742
00:50:57,708 --> 00:51:01,378
I've been around long enough to know
that everyone is out to get something.

743
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:04,668
Those kids? Those kids are in it
for the toys. And the grown-ups?

744
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:06,830
Well, I don’t know what they’re after.

745
00:51:06,916 --> 00:51:09,326
but it sure is not goodwill
and peace on Earth.

746
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:11,750
What about you?

747
00:51:12,541 --> 00:51:14,251
- What's in it for you?
- Me?

748
00:51:14,333 --> 00:51:16,503
Well, you know...

749
00:51:16,583 --> 00:51:18,383
It's different. I don't...

750
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Look out!

751
00:51:23,125 --> 00:51:24,955
- Mine!
- What?

752
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:27,666
Aah!

753
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:29,670
- I can't believe this!
- Whoa!

754
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:31,460
What are you doing at our ambush?

755
00:51:31,541 --> 00:51:33,671
Your ambush? This is our ambush!

756
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:35,500
- Stop, stop, stop!
- I'm trying!

757
00:51:35,583 --> 00:51:36,833
Stop! Stop!

758
00:51:41,916 --> 00:51:43,166
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

759
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:45,000
Oh, great! Look what you've done!

760
00:51:45,083 --> 00:51:46,642
- What we've done?
- Leave it to you...

761
00:51:46,666 --> 00:51:47,876
Whoa!

762
00:52:08,833 --> 00:52:10,083
Wow.

763
00:52:18,291 --> 00:52:19,791
Friends of yours, I take it?

764
00:52:20,875 --> 00:52:21,875
Uh...

765
00:52:22,541 --> 00:52:23,751
They seem nice.

766
00:52:31,833 --> 00:52:36,003
You guys are not gonna believe
what I saw last night!

767
00:52:36,958 --> 00:52:41,668
A flying sleigh
pulled by magical reindeer?

768
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:43,000
Yep.

769
00:52:48,083 --> 00:52:49,753
Oh, look, it can laugh.

770
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,173
- Ho ho ho!
- Mystery solved.

771
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:53,500
Ho ho ho!

772
00:52:53,583 --> 00:52:55,673
Ho ho ho!

773
00:52:56,416 --> 00:52:58,826
Wait, wait, wait. Time out. Really?

774
00:52:58,916 --> 00:53:00,246
- That's how you laugh?
- Right.

775
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:01,543
Let's load up.

776
00:53:01,625 --> 00:53:03,955
Oh, no, no. You don't get off that easy.

777
00:53:04,041 --> 00:53:05,251
- Let me hear it again.
- No.

778
00:53:05,333 --> 00:53:08,633
Come on.
Just a snicker or a chuckle.

779
00:53:08,708 --> 00:53:10,434
- Just a giggle.
- Keep it up. See what happens.

780
00:53:10,458 --> 00:53:11,458
All right. I'll stop.

781
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:15,540
Say, have you heard the one about
the one-legged man who walks into a bar?

782
00:53:32,416 --> 00:53:34,916
Say, we're kinda running low on inventory,
aren't we?

783
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,080
Yes, only a couple more trips,
and that should do it.

784
00:53:38,833 --> 00:53:39,833
You must be...

785
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:43,380
looking forward to no more night shifts.

786
00:53:43,458 --> 00:53:44,958
- Right?
- Right.

787
00:53:45,041 --> 00:53:47,131
Yeah. Yeah.

788
00:53:48,041 --> 00:53:49,041
Me too.

789
00:54:03,416 --> 00:54:05,076
Hello, Postman!

790
00:54:05,166 --> 00:54:06,876
Oh, good, you're back.

791
00:54:09,083 --> 00:54:10,633
Yes, yes, yes. That's very nice,

792
00:54:10,708 --> 00:54:13,748
but whatever it is you're saying,
I've got my own problems, you know?

793
00:54:15,041 --> 00:54:19,381
I mean, we are out of toys,
and without toys, there are no letters.

794
00:54:19,458 --> 00:54:20,578
And without letters...

795
00:54:21,166 --> 00:54:22,416
Ugh! Forget it.

796
00:54:24,833 --> 00:54:26,793
I'm running out of time! There, I said it!

797
00:54:26,875 --> 00:54:29,415
It's almost Christmas already,
and I still...

798
00:54:30,416 --> 00:54:32,786
Christmas. Christmas.

799
00:54:32,875 --> 00:54:33,995
That’s it. Wait.

800
00:54:34,083 --> 00:54:36,383
We gotta do... I gotta...

801
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:41,040
Can you please get off my porch?
You're trespassing.

802
00:54:56,833 --> 00:55:00,793
I, leader of the proud Krum...

803
00:55:00,875 --> 00:55:02,665
Get on with it already.

804
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:05,580
Shut up, you idiot! I'm getting to it!

805
00:55:06,791 --> 00:55:09,751
I, leader of the proud...

806
00:55:09,833 --> 00:55:11,833
Oh, forget it. The mood is gone.

807
00:55:11,916 --> 00:55:13,996
You know why I'm calling this meeting.

808
00:55:14,083 --> 00:55:15,833
Yeah, I... Of course I know.

809
00:55:15,916 --> 00:55:16,786
Uh...

810
00:55:16,875 --> 00:55:19,325
- Midnight brawl?
- Look around, Aksel!

811
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:20,576
Where is your clan?

812
00:55:23,833 --> 00:55:25,963
- Huh.
- I'll tell you where they are.

813
00:55:26,041 --> 00:55:30,171
They're at block parties!
Hayrides! And cookouts!

814
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:32,420
Brunches! Don't forget about the brunches.

815
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:36,750
It was a book club
that took my poor Sven!

816
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:40,133
You see? The postman
and that old toy maker

817
00:55:40,208 --> 00:55:42,578
are brainwashing everyone!

818
00:55:42,666 --> 00:55:43,746
What're you saying?

819
00:55:43,833 --> 00:55:47,713
I'm saying it's time to join forces
against a common enemy.

820
00:55:50,291 --> 00:55:53,251
I'm saying we need a truce.

821
00:55:53,333 --> 00:55:56,423
A truce? Have you gone mad?

822
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,960
Either we band together
to take care of this,

823
00:55:59,041 --> 00:56:00,881
or it's gonna be all book clubs

824
00:56:00,958 --> 00:56:02,934
- and cookouts from here on...
- And brunches!

825
00:56:02,958 --> 00:56:06,378
- Don't forget about the brunches.
- Yes, that... that too.

826
00:56:06,458 --> 00:56:11,788
So, we must join together in peace
to help stop this peace?

827
00:56:11,875 --> 00:56:15,165
Our ancestors demand it.

828
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:20,165
For the Ellingboe bloodline!

829
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:22,790
For the Krums' honor.

830
00:56:23,541 --> 00:56:26,421
The clans are on the warpath...

831
00:56:27,708 --> 00:56:28,788
together!

832
00:56:29,416 --> 00:56:31,996
Mine! Mine! Mine!

833
00:56:32,083 --> 00:56:33,833
Mine! Mine!

834
00:56:33,916 --> 00:56:35,326
Mine!

835
00:56:39,958 --> 00:56:41,748
I...

836
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:45,333
This is gonna take a lot of work.

837
00:57:47,541 --> 00:57:49,791
- Surprise!
- Oh!

838
00:57:49,875 --> 00:57:50,875
Jesper?

839
00:57:50,958 --> 00:57:54,748
- Wha-what are you...
- Welcome to your new workshop!

840
00:57:54,833 --> 00:57:56,753
- Ta-da!
- What... What is...

841
00:57:56,833 --> 00:57:58,601
- It'll all be explained in a minute.
- Why did you...

842
00:57:58,625 --> 00:58:00,495
- I don't want to...
- Come. Sit, sit, sit.

843
00:58:01,125 --> 00:58:03,165
You'll love this. I promise.

844
00:58:04,333 --> 00:58:05,883
Christmas!

845
00:58:06,875 --> 00:58:08,325
Christmas? What do you...

846
00:58:08,416 --> 00:58:12,126
Think about it! Every child in town
gets up on Christmas morning

847
00:58:12,208 --> 00:58:14,078
and finds a...

848
00:58:14,166 --> 00:58:17,246
brand-new toy waiting for them
by the fireplace.

849
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:19,880
We can make the holiday even more magical.

850
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:21,708
Think of the joy. Think of the happiness.

851
00:58:21,791 --> 00:58:23,171
Jesper, listen. I don't think...

852
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:24,250
Puh-puh-puh!

853
00:58:24,291 --> 00:58:26,461
Let me finish. Let me finish.

854
00:58:27,333 --> 00:58:29,083
Think of all those
happy little faces, huh?

855
00:58:29,166 --> 00:58:30,746
They're so cute! They're just... Aww!

856
00:58:30,833 --> 00:58:32,601
- Aren't they so... Look!
- Even if we...

857
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:34,875
Where are you gonna get that many toys?

858
00:58:35,375 --> 00:58:36,375
You...

859
00:58:36,875 --> 00:58:37,955
make new ones!

860
00:58:41,041 --> 00:58:42,831
I don't make toys.

861
00:58:44,666 --> 00:58:45,786
Not anymore.

862
00:58:45,875 --> 00:58:49,125
Pfft. You... You have a gift, my friend.

863
00:58:49,208 --> 00:58:51,248
Birdhouses are nice and all, but come on!

864
00:58:51,333 --> 00:58:52,713
Those hands were meant

865
00:58:52,791 --> 00:58:54,041
- for making...
- I said no.

866
00:58:54,125 --> 00:58:56,915
Come on! Work with me here.
Picture the possibilities.

867
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,580
Look, woodwork would go here.

868
00:58:58,666 --> 00:58:59,746
- No.
- And here,

869
00:58:59,833 --> 00:59:01,793
clockwork with all the gears and the cogs,

870
00:59:01,875 --> 00:59:03,309
- for you to tinker with all day.
- Stop it.

871
00:59:03,333 --> 00:59:06,463
And in this corner,
row after row of shiny tools

872
00:59:06,541 --> 00:59:08,559
- of all shapes and sizes.
- Wait! Don't touch that!

873
00:59:08,583 --> 00:59:10,503
- Impeccably organized for you!
- No!

874
00:59:22,833 --> 00:59:23,833
What's this?

875
00:59:26,041 --> 00:59:27,041
Get out.

876
00:59:27,416 --> 00:59:28,876
Klaus, I'm sorry.

877
00:59:28,958 --> 00:59:30,538
- I, I didn’t mean...
- Get out!

878
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:06,880
Bad night, huh?

879
01:00:07,541 --> 01:00:09,881
Ugh. Well, join the club.

880
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,580
Nah, I don't want to bore you with it.

881
01:00:17,666 --> 01:00:19,666
Well, okay.
It's just been bothering me, you know?

882
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:23,630
If I don't get those letters,
then what am I supposed to do?

883
01:00:23,708 --> 01:00:25,038
Stay in this little town forever,

884
01:00:25,125 --> 01:00:27,785
hanging out with an old woodsman,
surrounded by crazy people,

885
01:00:27,875 --> 01:00:29,535
and never wanting anything more?

886
01:00:32,333 --> 01:00:35,423
Back home,
I've got pretty much everything.

887
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:36,500
But here...

888
01:00:37,458 --> 01:00:38,748
I'm just...

889
01:00:38,833 --> 01:00:41,463
another irrelevant, pointless...

890
01:00:43,416 --> 01:00:44,416
nobody.

891
01:00:46,375 --> 01:00:49,035
But Klaus, he doesn't deserve...

892
01:00:49,125 --> 01:00:50,415
I didn't mean to...

893
01:00:51,125 --> 01:00:53,575
Well, now I just feel like a...
I've behaved like a...

894
01:00:55,208 --> 01:00:56,708
Precisely.

895
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:00,790
Hey. You're a pretty good listener,
you know?

896
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:06,630
All right, you win.

897
01:01:08,541 --> 01:01:09,671
Let's go. Follow me.

898
01:01:14,083 --> 01:01:15,503
Sorry to bother you this late, but,

899
01:01:15,583 --> 01:01:19,043
by any chance, would you happen
to understand... this?

900
01:01:25,541 --> 01:01:27,751
Okay. Come in.

901
01:01:33,333 --> 01:01:35,583
All right. Let's get started.

902
01:01:36,083 --> 01:01:39,003
Who wants some hot cocoa?

903
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:43,880
Oh, oh, oh!

904
01:01:43,958 --> 01:01:45,458
She said she'd like a boat!

905
01:01:45,541 --> 01:01:47,671
- Really?
- No, that can't be right. Scratch that.

906
01:01:49,666 --> 01:01:51,956
- Yes, yes, yes.
- What?

907
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:55,171
What're you talking about?
Are you talking about me?

01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:23,540
Looks like someone
might need help mailing letters.

940
01:05:23,625 --> 01:05:24,625
Yeah.

941
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:26,580
- Who?
- I, I...

942
01:05:26,666 --> 01:05:27,666
I mean...

943
01:05:28,375 --> 01:05:31,075
How have we never defeated you?

944
01:05:32,083 --> 01:05:33,923
Yeah, then...

945
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,420
when she got on the sled,
I thought, "Oh, no! We made it too small."

946
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,920
But no! It was just right for her size.

947
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,580
And she loved it, right?

948
01:05:41,666 --> 01:05:43,576
I think she did.
Do you think she loved it?

949
01:05:44,583 --> 01:05:45,963
- I do.
- Yeah.

950
01:05:46,041 --> 01:05:48,131
Me too. Me too. Yeah, she loved it.

951
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:55,290
You know, I remember the day I first had
that very same smile on my face.

952
01:05:55,375 --> 01:06:00,165
What? What smile? I wasn't smiling.
I was squinting. From the sun.

953
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:01,330
Right.

954
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:03,963
I didn't want to admit it at first either.

955
01:06:04,416 --> 01:06:06,416
She used to tease me about it.

956
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:07,500
"She"?

957
01:06:08,541 --> 01:06:09,881
My Lydia.

958
01:06:10,666 --> 01:06:14,626
I remember when I found
this spot in the woods that she loved.

959
01:06:15,541 --> 01:06:18,131
And I built us a house right here.

960
01:06:20,125 --> 01:06:21,125
Away from it all.

961
01:06:22,708 --> 01:06:25,208
But it wasn't gonna be
the two of us for long.

962
01:06:29,958 --> 01:06:30,958
<i>We wanted children.</i>

963
01:06:32,708 --> 01:06:33,708
<i>Lots of them.</i>

964
01:06:34,166 --> 01:06:36,626
<i>Running around, laughing,
getting in trouble.</i>

965
01:06:42,458 --> 01:06:43,878
While we waited,

966
01:06:44,458 --> 01:06:46,128
I started making toys for them.

967
01:06:46,708 --> 01:06:51,128
And we waited,
and I kept making toys and more toys.

968
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:54,055
Oh! Here's another one. What do you think?

969
01:06:54,125 --> 01:06:55,495
And we kept waiting,

970
01:06:56,333 --> 01:06:58,713
but they never came...

971
01:07:01,666 --> 01:07:02,666
And then...

972
01:07:05,583 --> 01:07:07,253
she got sick.

973
01:07:12,458 --> 01:07:15,418
Even now... sometimes...

974
01:07:16,375 --> 01:07:19,285
it almost feels like she's still...

975
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:28,881
After... After she was gone,

976
01:07:29,875 --> 01:07:32,285
I... I guess I got lost.

977
01:07:33,458 --> 01:07:38,628
She loved birds,
so I just kept making birdhouses.

978
01:07:40,708 --> 01:07:41,708
But then...

979
01:07:42,208 --> 01:07:43,918
Then you showed up.

980
01:07:44,583 --> 01:07:49,173
Delivering these toys,
seeing the joy they bring to children,

981
01:07:49,791 --> 01:07:51,671
I thought I'd never feel this again.

982
01:07:52,291 --> 01:07:55,331
And I have you to thank for it, my friend.

983
01:07:55,916 --> 01:07:57,916
So... thank you.

984
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:00,500
Of course.

985
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,210
- Hey, you know what? We're doing it!
- What?

986
01:08:04,791 --> 01:08:06,461
- Doing what?
- The Christmas thing!

987
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:08,251
We're making all those toys!

988
01:08:08,333 --> 01:08:10,053
- That's what she would've wanted.
- Really?

989
01:08:10,125 --> 01:08:12,785
Yeah, really!
And with a whole year of planning,

990
01:08:12,875 --> 01:08:15,415
- we can expand to more villages next year.
- Next year?

991
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,351
- And more the year after that!
- But I won't...

992
01:08:17,375 --> 01:08:19,142
I mean, who knows
what's gonna happen next year?

993
01:08:19,166 --> 01:08:20,206
I might not even...

994
01:08:20,291 --> 01:08:23,751
What're you going on about?
Let's go! No time to lose!

995
01:08:25,166 --> 01:08:26,876

1007
01:09:08,375 --> 01:09:10,495
Oh! Uh... I forgot about homework.

1008
01:09:10,583 --> 01:09:12,101
You know what? No homework.

- happened here?
- Oh.

1012
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:20,080
Yeah, I thought
I would give the place an update.

1013
01:09:20,166 --> 01:09:22,666
Everybody knows rotting fish is so over.

1014
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:24,380
How did you pay for this?

1015
01:09:24,458 --> 01:09:25,668
Hmm?

1016
01:09:25,750 --> 01:09:29,080
- Your savings?
- Well, not all of it.

1017
01:09:29,166 --> 01:09:31,246
Actually, yeah, all of it.
But check it out.

1018
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:32,493
I think it looks pretty good.

1019
01:09:32,541 --> 01:09:35,671
What about starting
far, far away from here?

1020
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:36,750
Where's that Alva?

1021
01:09:36,791 --> 01:09:38,751
Someone would have to be pretty stupid

1022
01:09:38,833 --> 01:09:40,476
to want to leave this place now.

01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:41,790

01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:44,080

1026
01:09:47,375 --> 01:09:49,745

01:09:58,333 --> 01:10:00,213

- Hello.
- Miss. Alva.

1035
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:38,630
Not quite the same place,

1036
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:51,500
Hey.

Never fails.

1041
01:11:09,916 --> 01:11:12,826
Remember, put the letter in the envelope.

1042
01:11:12,916 --> 01:11:15,226
- And pass it down the line.
- Come on! It doesn't have to rhyme.

1043
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:17,476
- That's right, keep at it.
- Keep it short and sweet!

1044
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:19,170
No extra points for good spelling.

1045
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:21,809
- Oh, you're doing so great, pumpkin.
- Let's go! One letter!

1046
01:11:21,833 --> 01:11:24,473
Come on,
it doesn't have to be Shakespeare, people.

1047
01:11:29,375 --> 01:11:30,665
Whoa!

1048
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:32,880
Steady, ol' girl! Easy does it.

1049
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:36,791
Oh, wow!

1050
01:11:41,708 --> 01:11:45,038
Uh-huh. Smooth lines. Good. Nice work.

1051
01:11:46,750 --> 01:11:47,750
Hello!

1052
01:11:48,541 --> 01:11:49,541
Hi.

1053
01:11:53,875 --> 01:11:55,995
What am I supposed to do, huh?

1054
01:11:57,083 --> 01:11:59,043
<i>Stay forever in this little town?</i>

1055
01:12:02,958 --> 01:12:04,628
<i>Hanging out with an old woodsman?</i>

1056
01:12:10,791 --> 01:12:12,331
<i>Surrounded by crazy people?</i>

1057
01:12:37,166 --> 01:12:38,826
<i>Never wanting anything more?</i>

1058
01:12:53,666 --> 01:12:55,576
Okay, are you gonna do that part or...

1059
01:12:55,666 --> 01:12:57,206
How about you finish these and...

1060
01:12:57,291 --> 01:12:58,291
Whoa!

1061
01:13:05,041 --> 01:13:09,171
They insisted,
and I didn't want to be rude.

1062
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:11,500
I don't know... What do you...
Pfft. It's a lot of red.

1063
01:13:11,583 --> 01:13:12,923
What do you... Is it too much?

1064
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,420
No.

1065
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:17,210
We'll just blindfold the reindeer
so they don't get dizzy.

1066
01:13:17,291 --> 01:13:18,517
- That's all. I'm kidding.
- Aw...

1067
01:13:18,541 --> 01:13:19,541
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

1068
01:13:19,583 --> 01:13:22,003
It looks great. It looks good.
It's nice. It's...

1069
01:13:22,083 --> 01:13:23,293
Hello, Jesper.

1070
01:13:23,375 --> 01:13:24,785
Dad? What?

1071
01:13:24,875 --> 01:13:27,915
Sorry.
Let's, um... Let's talk outside.

1072
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,460
It's a little cramped in here.

1073
01:13:32,125 --> 01:13:33,495
Dad, what're you doing here?

1074
01:13:33,583 --> 01:13:35,753
Time isn't up yet.
I've still got a few days until...

1075
01:13:35,833 --> 01:13:38,503
Fourteen thousand letters
out of Smeerensburg?

1076
01:13:38,583 --> 01:13:40,923
Well, I had to come and see it for myself.

1077
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,710
Dad, you can't just show up and...

1078
01:13:42,791 --> 01:13:44,581
Wait, what? 14,000?

1079
01:13:44,666 --> 01:13:47,126
- That's not right. It...
- Oh, but it is.

1080
01:13:47,208 --> 01:13:49,328
Don't be so modest.

1081
01:13:49,416 --> 01:13:50,456
What're they doing here?

1082
01:13:50,541 --> 01:13:53,251
They were the ones who alerted me
to what you've accomplished here.

1083
01:13:53,333 --> 01:13:56,543
We couldn't let such a feat go unrewarded.

1084
01:13:56,625 --> 01:13:58,165
Listen, whatever they told you...

1085
01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:00,000
Well, then, ready to go?

1086
01:14:00,083 --> 01:14:01,463
Go? Where?

1087
01:14:01,541 --> 01:14:03,791
Home, of course.

1088
01:14:03,875 --> 01:14:07,125
A deal's a deal. The ordeal is over.

1089
01:14:08,125 --> 01:14:09,125
Home?

1090
01:14:09,458 --> 01:14:12,328
With the personal butler
and the breakfast in bed and...

1091
01:14:13,166 --> 01:14:14,246
my silk sheets?

1092
01:14:14,333 --> 01:14:16,543
No one deserves it more.

1093
01:14:16,625 --> 01:14:20,285
Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Klaus?

1094
01:14:22,916 --> 01:14:25,496
Oh, he was unbelievable!

1095
01:14:25,583 --> 01:14:29,133
Encouraging children to write letters
and go to school!

1096
01:14:29,208 --> 01:14:32,288
Convincing the locals
to donate their labor to...

1097
01:14:32,375 --> 01:14:34,665
such a worthy cause.

1098
01:14:35,333 --> 01:14:36,333
Indeed.

1099
01:14:37,041 --> 01:14:38,751
Well, shall we then?

1100
01:14:40,541 --> 01:14:43,461
Perhaps a minute to say your goodbyes,
of course.

1101
01:14:47,041 --> 01:14:48,831
Please, I can explain.

1102
01:14:48,916 --> 01:14:50,916
- I was...
- Oh, it's very clear.

1103
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,250
You just duped everyone

1104
01:14:52,333 --> 01:14:55,633
so you could get back to your
puffed-up life back in the big town.

1105
01:14:55,708 --> 01:14:56,578
Something like that?

1106
01:14:56,666 --> 01:15:01,576
No! No. Well, at first maybe, yes,
but, Alva, please come...

1107
01:15:01,666 --> 01:15:02,666
Alva, please come back.

1108
01:15:02,750 --> 01:15:06,630
If I, I didn’t get the letters,
I’d be cut off, but things changed!

1109
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:09,830
Jesper!

1110
01:15:09,916 --> 01:15:12,286
- Jesper!
- Márgu...

1111
01:15:14,583 --> 01:15:16,293
Klaus, just listen. I...

1112
01:15:16,375 --> 01:15:18,575
Everybody's out to get something, right?

1113
01:15:41,041 --> 01:15:42,041
I thought...

1114
01:15:42,083 --> 01:15:44,713
well, a bit of hardship
might help straighten you out,

1115
01:15:44,791 --> 01:15:46,711
but even I must admit that...

1116
01:15:46,791 --> 01:15:50,331
Well, let's just say that there's
certainly a bright future

1117
01:15:50,416 --> 01:15:53,746
for the man who brought postal service
to Smeerensburg, that's for sure.

1118
01:15:53,833 --> 01:15:57,083
And speaking of the future,
I look forward to discussing...

1119
01:16:01,541 --> 01:16:04,131
One down, one to go.

1120
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,420
If you ask me "who" right now, I swear!

1121
01:16:26,541 --> 01:16:29,331
Well, now, finally leaving, aren't we?

1122
01:16:29,416 --> 01:16:31,496
I... uh...

1123
01:16:32,166 --> 01:16:33,246
Anchors away, Captain.

1124
01:16:33,333 --> 01:16:35,963
- We're sailing off at once.
- Well, that's a first.

1125
01:16:36,041 --> 01:16:36,961
I beg your pardon?

1126
01:16:37,041 --> 01:16:39,671
Never saw a postman
looking more miserable leaving

1127
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:41,290
than on the day they came in.

1128
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:45,080
Oh, well. Best leave it alone, I say.

1129
01:16:45,166 --> 01:16:47,246
I'm sure it's nothing that could fester

1130
01:16:47,333 --> 01:16:50,213
and eventually become
a source of resentment and regret.

1131
01:17:21,083 --> 01:17:22,383
Jesper!

1132
01:17:31,916 --> 01:17:33,786
Jesper.

1133
01:17:37,958 --> 01:17:39,208
Cheer up, little one.

1134
01:17:41,625 --> 01:17:43,375
I think I may have missed my boat.

1135
01:17:44,125 --> 01:17:46,575
Jesper!

1136
01:17:49,666 --> 01:17:51,626
So I told him.
I told him everything.

1137
01:17:52,166 --> 01:17:54,666
And then he turned to me, and he said...

1138
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:56,710
...he'd never been
more proud of me.

1139
01:17:57,208 --> 01:17:59,828
And he hugged me. Can you believe that?

1140
01:17:59,916 --> 01:18:01,126
I thought he'd be mad.

1141
01:18:04,083 --> 01:18:05,503
Well, yeah, sure. I'll miss it.

1142
01:18:05,583 --> 01:18:09,923
The big house, the having my every whim
tended to, the silk sheets.

1143
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,750
Oh, God, the silk sheets!
Can we change the subject?

1144
01:18:15,208 --> 01:18:17,668
Anyways, anybody can get off a boat.

1145
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:20,750
The real trick is gonna be
convincing Klaus and Alva to give me an...

1146
01:18:21,583 --> 01:18:22,583
What? What's that?

1147
01:18:24,875 --> 01:18:25,875
It's the clans!

1148
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:28,963
Klaus!

1149
01:18:37,875 --> 01:18:38,875
Slowly.

1150
01:18:39,458 --> 01:18:41,788
Slowly. Slowly.

1151
01:18:41,875 --> 01:18:42,955
A little bit...

1152
01:18:48,291 --> 01:18:49,461
Well, well.

1153
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:51,875
Isn't this convenient?

1154
01:18:54,041 --> 01:18:55,291
What're you doing here?

1155
01:18:55,375 --> 01:18:57,495
Why, we were just thinking,

1156
01:18:57,583 --> 01:19:01,253
"Don't our children
also deserve a present?"

1157
01:19:01,333 --> 01:19:02,583
And lookie here!

1158
01:19:02,666 --> 01:19:05,036
You've already got her favorite thing
in the world.

1159
01:19:05,125 --> 01:19:07,375
A nice, big piñata!

1160
01:19:07,458 --> 01:19:09,628
Hey, you put...

1161
01:19:09,708 --> 01:19:11,748
...one hand on those toys and I swear I...

1162
01:19:11,833 --> 01:19:13,253
Stand back. All right.

1163
01:19:13,333 --> 01:19:15,333
Do what you will with the toys.

1164
01:19:15,416 --> 01:19:16,876
But no one gets hurt.

1165
01:19:16,958 --> 01:19:19,208
Suits us just fine.

1166
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:23,960
How long until children
go back to the old ways

1167
01:19:24,041 --> 01:19:26,831
once there are no toys to bribe them with?

1168
01:19:27,416 --> 01:19:29,956
How long until they
turn against each other?

1169
01:19:30,791 --> 01:19:35,461
And how long until the grown-ups follow?

1170
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,130
Jesper?

1171
01:19:47,208 --> 01:19:48,288
The postman!

1172
01:19:52,708 --> 01:19:54,248
Ha! Eat our snow, you...

1173
01:19:54,916 --> 01:19:56,876
They're not attached.
Why aren't they attached?

1174
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:58,017
I thought they were attached.

1175
01:19:58,041 --> 01:20:01,081
I would never, in a million years,
have done what I just did

1176
01:20:01,166 --> 01:20:02,601
if I didn't think these were attached.

1177
01:20:02,625 --> 01:20:03,665
After them!

1178
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:07,250
Who leaves a sleigh
unattached like... Aah!

1179
01:20:07,333 --> 01:20:08,543
Destroy those toys!

1180
01:20:08,625 --> 01:20:10,875
- Stop them at any cost!
- Mine!

1181
01:20:10,958 --> 01:20:13,578
Mine! Mine!

1182
01:20:14,083 --> 01:20:15,333
Mine!

1183
01:20:17,833 --> 01:20:19,793
Mine...

1184
01:20:20,666 --> 01:20:23,576
Mine!

1185
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:32,538
I could really use a hand here.

1186
01:20:32,625 --> 01:20:35,205
"Use." Interesting choice of word.

1187
01:20:35,291 --> 01:20:37,711
Really? You're gonna
go for the guilt trip now?

1188
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:39,961
Smash those toys to pieces!

1189
01:20:45,958 --> 01:20:47,248
The toys!

1190
01:20:47,333 --> 01:20:49,673
- We have to close that bag!
- What do you care?

1191
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:52,790
- I thought you were leaving.
- Great. Sure. I'll tell you what.

1192
01:20:52,875 --> 01:20:55,825
Let's continue discussing
what a horrible person I am

1193
01:20:55,916 --> 01:20:59,286
while I most likely break my neck
trying to save the children's toys,

1194
01:20:59,375 --> 01:21:01,455
- why don't we?
- Get down there!

1195
01:21:01,541 --> 01:21:03,211
Stop those toys!

1196
01:21:05,041 --> 01:21:06,711
Uh... Klaus?

1197
01:21:07,541 --> 01:21:08,541
Hmm.

1198
01:21:17,041 --> 01:21:20,041
Nice move! How'd you know
I wouldn't get knocked off too?

1199
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:21,825
Never mind. Don't answer that.

1200
01:21:23,583 --> 01:21:24,963
- Mine!
- Whoa!

1201
01:21:25,041 --> 01:21:27,211
Go! Go! We're dead!
We're dead! We're dead!

1202
01:21:27,291 --> 01:21:28,541
Mine!

1203
01:21:29,125 --> 01:21:31,785
Mine!

1204
01:21:33,833 --> 01:21:35,213
Pumpkin!

1205
01:21:35,291 --> 01:21:37,461
I'm still proud of you, you hear me?

1206
01:21:44,291 --> 01:21:45,831
Mine?

1207
01:21:54,083 --> 01:21:55,833
We're losing toys!

1208
01:22:05,041 --> 01:22:07,041
Oh, no!

1209
01:22:07,125 --> 01:22:08,559
- Stop! Stop!
- Oh, my goodness!

1210
01:22:08,583 --> 01:22:11,253
Oh, no, no, no! No!

1211
01:22:25,375 --> 01:22:27,325
Jesper! Let go!

1212
01:22:27,416 --> 01:22:30,036
- It's not worth it!
- Are you crazy? No!

1213
01:22:40,625 --> 01:22:43,035
See? Nothing to it. Just...

1214
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:45,415
I wouldn't be so sure.

1215
01:22:47,458 --> 01:22:48,958
Wait! No, no, no!

1216
01:22:49,458 --> 01:22:54,788
No! No, no, no! No!

1217
01:23:00,916 --> 01:23:05,076
This town was built
on resentment and spite.

1218
01:23:05,166 --> 01:23:08,076
And it'll stay that way
as long as a Krum...

1219
01:23:08,166 --> 01:23:09,376
Or an Ellingboe!

1220
01:23:09,458 --> 01:23:10,288
Ugh.

1221
01:23:10,375 --> 01:23:12,745
...have something to say about it.

1222
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:16,000
Let's go. We're done here.

1223
01:23:16,083 --> 01:23:18,833
Well said.
Wait, does that mean the feud is back on?

1224
01:23:18,916 --> 01:23:20,166
No more truce?

1225
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:21,670
First thing tomorrow.

1226
01:23:22,791 --> 01:23:24,421
A true act of goodwill.

1227
01:23:25,416 --> 01:23:26,416
What was that?

1228
01:23:31,291 --> 01:23:33,581
A true act of goodwill...

1229
01:23:34,625 --> 01:23:36,325
always sparks another.

1230
01:23:37,041 --> 01:23:39,381
I think you hit your head
pretty hard, dear.

1231
01:23:39,458 --> 01:23:40,918
You should lie back down.

1232
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:43,920
You don't believe me? Turn around.

1233
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,130
What?

1234
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:46,830
Turn around.

1235
01:23:50,833 --> 01:23:52,083
Mine.

1236
01:23:52,166 --> 01:23:53,376
- Pumpkin!
- Honey!

1237
01:23:53,458 --> 01:23:55,208
- Drop that immediately!
- Mine!

1238
01:23:55,291 --> 01:23:57,226
- Honey! Sweetie!
- Let go and come back here right now.

1239
01:23:57,250 --> 01:23:58,934
- Get down from there!
- Mine!

1240
01:23:58,958 --> 01:23:59,788
It's Mama calling.

1241
01:23:59,875 --> 01:24:01,642
- Put the boy down.
- Remember Mama?

1242
01:24:01,666 --> 01:24:03,536
You don't know
where he's been.

1243
01:24:03,625 --> 01:24:05,325
Klaus, I don't know what to say.

1244
01:24:05,916 --> 01:24:06,916
If I hadn't...

1245
01:24:11,708 --> 01:24:12,748
What's this?

1246
01:24:20,750 --> 01:24:23,040
The presents in the sleigh were all fake?

1247
01:24:23,125 --> 01:24:24,955
Give me a little credit.

1248
01:24:25,041 --> 01:24:27,171
I wasn't going to let them have the toys.

1249
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:29,670
- But how did you know that...
- Kids talk, you know?

1250
01:24:29,750 --> 01:24:31,380
And if kids happen to be talking

1251
01:24:31,458 --> 01:24:33,958
about their parents plotting to form
an angry mob,

1252
01:24:34,041 --> 01:24:35,581
then, you know, teachers listen.

1253
01:24:35,666 --> 01:24:36,876
It was a simple plan.

1254
01:24:37,458 --> 01:24:40,828
They would destroy
the decoys and leave.

1255
01:24:40,916 --> 01:24:44,036
But then you showed up
and made it complicated. As usual.

1256
01:24:44,125 --> 01:24:45,745
So, all this was for nothing?

1257
01:24:46,541 --> 01:24:48,631
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

1258
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:54,500
Shall we then?

1259
01:25:15,833 --> 01:25:17,583
He came! He came!

1260
01:25:19,041 --> 01:25:20,631
- Yeah!
- Mine's the big one!

1261
01:25:23,166 --> 01:25:25,456
I told you! I told you he would come!

1262
01:25:25,541 --> 01:25:27,331
Mom! Come here, quick!

1263
01:25:28,166 --> 01:25:29,326
- Yes!
- Yeah!

1264
01:25:29,416 --> 01:25:31,706
- It's just what I wanted!
- He came! He came! He came!

1265
01:25:31,791 --> 01:25:35,541
Dad! Mom! Wake up! You have to see this!

1266
01:25:45,625 --> 01:25:46,745
<i>Life went on.</i>

1267
01:25:47,375 --> 01:25:49,875
<i>And Smeerensburg continued
to change for the better.</i>

1268
01:25:57,208 --> 01:25:58,498
<i>Poetic, don't you think?</i>

1269
01:26:01,250 --> 01:26:02,420
<i>As for Alva and I...</i>

1270
01:26:04,416 --> 01:26:08,576
<i>well, what'd you expect?
Of course she loved me.</i>

1271
01:26:15,125 --> 01:26:18,575
<i>Every year, come the Christmas season,
the letters started pouring in.</i>

1272
01:26:19,083 --> 01:26:21,923
<i>More and more each time,
and from farther away.</i>

1273
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,080
<i>We </i>did <i>have to expand the operation,</i>
<i>just like we had planned.</i>

1274
01:26:25,916 --> 01:26:29,326
<i>More children, more toys, more towns.</i>

1275
01:26:35,416 --> 01:26:37,666
It's so bright you can even see at night.

1276
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:40,960
Oh, look over there!
See the red and yellow along the rim?

1277
01:26:44,375 --> 01:26:45,434
<i>The years went by.</i>

1278
01:26:45,458 --> 01:26:48,018
Any chance for a hot cup of coffee
for your neighborhood mailman?

1279
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,420
What is on your face?

1280
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:56,210
What? You don't like it?
I think it looks good on me, don't you?

1281
01:26:56,291 --> 01:26:58,631
Be honest. Alva hates it.

1282
01:26:58,708 --> 01:27:00,208
<i>Each better than the last.</i>

1283
01:27:02,041 --> 01:27:04,711
<i>And then, on the 12th year...</i>

1284
01:27:25,041 --> 01:27:26,581
I'm coming, love.

1285
01:28:19,416 --> 01:28:20,996
<i>I looked for him everywhere.</i>

1286
01:28:22,916 --> 01:28:26,286
<i>I asked everyone,
but we just couldn't find him.</i>

1287
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:28,750
<i>No goodbye.</i>

1288
01:28:29,958 --> 01:28:31,418
<i>No explanation.</i>

1289
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:32,500
<i>Nothing.</i>

1290
01:28:32,916 --> 01:28:34,456
<i>It was as if he had just...</i>

1291
01:28:36,666 --> 01:28:37,916
<i>faded away.</i>

1292
01:28:45,125 --> 01:28:46,245
All right.

1293
01:28:46,333 --> 01:28:49,253
I've got two urgent deliveries here,
Postmaster, sir!

1294
01:28:49,333 --> 01:28:51,003
The letters are getting in the envelope.

1295
01:28:51,083 --> 01:28:52,923
Proceed to stamp the letter.

1296
01:28:53,916 --> 01:28:55,286
Another stamp.

1297
01:28:55,375 --> 01:28:57,642
Signed, sealed, to be delivered!

1298
01:28:57,666 --> 01:28:59,416
- Nighty night, kids!
- Go to sleep, now.

1299
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:00,517
Night, Mom! Night, Dad!

1300
01:29:00,541 --> 01:29:02,131
- Good night.
- Good night.

1301
01:29:20,125 --> 01:29:21,805
<i>What happened to him</i>
<i>after that...</i>

1302
01:29:22,250 --> 01:29:24,420
<i>how, why...</i>

1303
01:29:25,458 --> 01:29:28,328
<i>I can't even begin to comprehend.</i>

1304
01:29:29,291 --> 01:29:32,331
<i>I stopped trying to
make sense of it a long time ago.</i>

1305
01:29:45,583 --> 01:29:47,923
<i>What I do know...</i>

1306
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,380
<i>...is that once a year...</i>

1307
01:29:51,458 --> 01:29:53,248
