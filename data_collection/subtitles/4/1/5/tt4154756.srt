1
00:00:19,996 --> 00:00:23,434
<i>This is the Asgardian
refugee vessel.</i>

2
00:00:27,096 --> 00:00:30,744
<i>We are under assault. I
repeat, we are under assault.</i>

3
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:33,783
<i>Aliens are dead, sliced open...</i>

4
00:00:34,885 --> 00:00:38,526
<i>Requesting aid from any
vessel within range...</i>

5
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,505
<i>Our crew is made of Asgardian
families, we have very few soldiers here.</i>

6
00:00:46,506 --> 00:00:50,507
<i>This is not a war craft, I
repeat, this is not a war craft.</i>

7
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,788
Hear me... and rejoice.

8
00:01:10,374 --> 00:01:12,576
You have had the privilege

9
00:01:12,776 --> 00:01:15,655
of being saved
by the Great Titan.

10
00:01:18,348 --> 00:01:20,902
You may think this is suffering.

11
00:01:21,786 --> 00:01:23,307
No.

12
00:01:23,507 --> 00:01:26,060
It is salvation.

13
00:01:30,135 --> 00:01:32,168
Universal scales

14
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:35,955
tipped toward balance
because of your sacrifice.

15
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,797
Smile

16
00:01:38,997 --> 00:01:41,641
for even in death

17
00:01:41,941 --> 00:01:44,878
you have become
Children of Thanos.

18
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:02,784
I know what it's like to lose.

19
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,736
To feel so desperately
that you're right,

20
00:02:07,936 --> 00:02:10,384
yet to fail nonetheless.

21
00:02:18,383 --> 00:02:20,511
As lightning

22
00:02:20,711 --> 00:02:23,729
turns the legs to jelly.

23
00:02:25,806 --> 00:02:28,860
I ask you
to what end?

24
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:32,696
Dread it, run from it...

25
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:35,520
Destiny arrives all the same.

26
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,549
And now, it's here.

27
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:40,825
Or should I say...

28
00:02:42,325 --> 00:02:43,856
I am.

29
00:02:48,994 --> 00:02:51,189
You talk too much.

30
00:02:51,814 --> 00:02:53,361
The Tesseract.

31
00:02:53,561 --> 00:02:56,048
Or, your brother's head.

32
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:02,703
I assume you have a preference?

33
00:03:03,843 --> 00:03:05,468
Oh, I do.

34
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,225
Kill away.

35
00:03:24,072 --> 00:03:25,720
All right, stop!

36
00:03:28,837 --> 00:03:33,047
We don't have the Tesseract.
It was destroyed on Asgard.

37
00:03:44,571 --> 00:03:47,227
You really are the worst, brother.

38
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,759
I assure you, brother. The
sun will shine on us again.

39
00:03:57,274 --> 00:04:00,642
Your optimism is
misplaced, Asgardian.

40
00:04:00,696 --> 00:04:04,953
Well, for one thing,
I'm not Asgardian.

41
00:04:05,027 --> 00:04:06,465
And for another...

42
00:04:08,013 --> 00:04:09,997
we have a Hulk.

43
00:04:21,877 --> 00:04:23,775
Let him have his fun.

44
00:05:15,672 --> 00:05:17,422
Forefathers...

45
00:05:18,995 --> 00:05:23,846
Let the dark magic, flow
through me one last... time.

46
00:05:38,991 --> 00:05:40,905
That was a mistake.

47
00:05:46,323 --> 00:05:47,596
No!

48
00:05:57,147 --> 00:06:00,185
You are going to die for that!

49
00:06:11,098 --> 00:06:13,504
My humble personage...

50
00:06:14,356 --> 00:06:18,145
bows before your grandeur.

51
00:06:19,817 --> 00:06:23,084
No other being, has
ever had the might,

52
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,153
nay, the nobility,

53
00:06:25,798 --> 00:06:30,793
to wield not one,
but two Infinity Stones.

54
00:06:33,623 --> 00:06:35,385
The Universe,

55
00:06:35,585 --> 00:06:38,701
lies within your grasp.

56
00:07:17,368 --> 00:07:21,055
There are two more
Stones on Earth.

57
00:07:21,578 --> 00:07:25,350
Find them, my Children, and
bring them to me on Titan.

58
00:07:25,382 --> 00:07:29,577
- Father, we will not fail you.
- If I might, interject...

59
00:07:29,609 --> 00:07:31,062
If you're going to Earth,

60
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:33,687
you might want a guide.

61
00:07:33,688 --> 00:07:36,407
I do have a bit of
experience in that arena.

62
00:07:36,454 --> 00:07:38,891
If you consider failure experience.

63
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:41,594
I consider experience, experience.

64
00:07:42,891 --> 00:07:44,562
Almighty Thanos.

65
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:49,829
I, Loki, Prince of Asgard...

66
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:55,422
Odin-son...

67
00:07:58,297 --> 00:08:00,673
The rightful king of Jotunheim,

68
00:08:00,937 --> 00:08:03,461
God of Mischief...

69
00:08:03,508 --> 00:08:05,759
Do hereby pledge to you,

70
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:10,319
my undying fidelity.

71
00:08:21,193 --> 00:08:23,099
"Undying"?

72
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,466
You should choose your
words more carefully.

73
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,364
You...

74
00:08:52,341 --> 00:08:55,059
will never be...

75
00:08:56,622 --> 00:08:58,184
a god.

76
00:09:23,968 --> 00:09:27,171
No resurrections this time.

77
00:09:49,909 --> 00:09:52,729
No... Loki...

78
00:10:31,137 --> 00:10:34,160
Seriously? You don't
have any money?

79
00:10:34,185 --> 00:10:37,489
Attachment to the material is
detachment from the spiritual.

80
00:10:37,514 --> 00:10:38,873
I'll tell the guys at the deli.

81
00:10:38,909 --> 00:10:41,474
Maybe they'll make you a
metaphysical Ham and Rye.

82
00:10:41,499 --> 00:10:44,011
- Wait, wait. I think I got a 200.
- Dollars?

83
00:10:44,036 --> 00:10:45,982
- Rupees.
- Which is?

84
00:10:49,461 --> 00:10:51,851
I wouldn't say no
to a Tuna Melt.

85
00:11:04,053 --> 00:11:05,803
Thanos is coming.

86
00:11:06,381 --> 00:11:07,982
We've got to...

87
00:11:12,073 --> 00:11:13,199
Who?

88
00:11:22,504 --> 00:11:24,207
Slow down. I'm
totally not kidding.

89
00:11:24,232 --> 00:11:25,497
- No, I'm not.
- Your rambling lost me.

90
00:11:25,521 --> 00:11:28,566
Look, you know how you're having a
dream, and in the dream you gotta pee?

91
00:11:28,591 --> 00:11:29,331
Yeah.

92
00:11:29,343 --> 00:11:31,598
Okay, then you're like, my
God, there's no bathroom,

93
00:11:31,623 --> 00:11:33,052
what am I gonna do? Oh!
Someone's watching!

94
00:11:33,076 --> 00:11:36,047
Right. And then you wake up, and in
real life you actually have to pee.

95
00:11:36,072 --> 00:11:37,412
- Yes.
- Yeah.

96
00:11:37,439 --> 00:11:38,496
Everybody has that.

97
00:11:38,508 --> 00:11:40,900
Right. That's the point
I'm trying to make.

98
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:44,743
Last night, I dreamt,
we had a kid.

99
00:11:44,963 --> 00:11:46,362
So real.

100
00:11:46,562 --> 00:11:48,431
We named him after
your eccentric uncle.

101
00:11:48,463 --> 00:11:51,431
- What was his name? Porsey. Morgan.
- Right.

102
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:55,339
So you woke up,
and we were...

103
00:11:55,364 --> 00:11:56,614
- Expecting.
- Yeah.

104
00:11:56,622 --> 00:11:57,529
- Yes?
- No.

105
00:11:57,554 --> 00:12:01,007
- I had a dream about it. It was so real.
- If you wanted to have a kid...

106
00:12:01,046 --> 00:12:03,075
You wouldn't have done that.

107
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,305
I'm glad you brought this up

108
00:12:04,382 --> 00:12:07,014
cause it's nothing,
just a housing unit for nano-parts.

109
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,737
- It's not helping your case. OK?
- It's an attachment. It's not a...

110
00:12:09,761 --> 00:12:12,346
- You don't need that.
- I know. I had the surgery.

111
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:15,419
I'm just trying to protect us.
The future, as is, and that's it.

112
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:18,131
Just in case there's a monster in
the closet. Just letting you know.

113
00:12:18,162 --> 00:12:19,749
Shirts.

114
00:12:20,881 --> 00:12:22,568
You know me so well.

115
00:12:22,967 --> 00:12:24,822
You finish all my sentences.

116
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,943
You should have shirts
in your closet.

117
00:12:27,975 --> 00:12:30,742
Yeah. You know what
there should be?

118
00:12:30,767 --> 00:12:33,681
No more surprises. We'll
have a nice dinner tonight.

119
00:12:35,954 --> 00:12:38,963
We should have no more surprises.
Ever. I should promise you.

120
00:12:38,988 --> 00:12:40,644
- Yeah.
- I will.

121
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:46,522
Tony Stark,
I'm Dr. Stephen Strange.

122
00:12:46,722 --> 00:12:49,104
I need you to come with me.

123
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:52,869
Oh. Congratulations on
the wedding, by the way.

124
00:12:52,894 --> 00:12:54,952
I'm sorry. You giving
out tickets or something?

125
00:12:54,962 --> 00:12:56,278
We need your help.

126
00:12:56,862 --> 00:13:00,322
Look, it's not overselling it to say that
the fate of the Universe is at stake.

127
00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:02,877
And who's "we"?

128
00:13:03,463 --> 00:13:06,346
- Hey, Tony.
- Bruce!

129
00:13:10,471 --> 00:13:12,689
You okay?

130
00:13:13,782 --> 00:13:15,832
From the dawn of the Universe,

131
00:13:16,235 --> 00:13:19,688
there was nothing.
Then, boom!

132
00:13:20,312 --> 00:13:23,758
The Big Bang sends
six elemental crystals,

133
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,911
hurdling across the virgin Universe.

134
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,307
These Infinity Stones

135
00:13:29,407 --> 00:13:32,300
each control an essential
aspect of existence.

136
00:13:33,302 --> 00:13:34,801
Space.

137
00:13:35,653 --> 00:13:37,340
Reality.

138
00:13:38,394 --> 00:13:39,964
Power.

139
00:13:40,574 --> 00:13:42,167
Soul.

140
00:13:43,051 --> 00:13:44,785
Mind.

141
00:13:46,184 --> 00:13:48,191
And Time.

142
00:13:57,111 --> 00:13:59,696
- Tell me his name again.
- Thanos.

143
00:13:59,736 --> 00:14:03,150
He's a plague, Tony. He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.

144
00:14:03,174 --> 00:14:07,056
He wipes out half the population.
He sent Loki.

145
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:10,486
The attack on New York. That's him.

146
00:14:13,631 --> 00:14:15,490
- What's our time line?
- No telling.

147
00:14:15,498 --> 00:14:17,165
He has the Power and Space Stones,

148
00:14:17,265 --> 00:14:19,841
that only makes him the strongest
creature in the whole Universe.

149
00:14:19,866 --> 00:14:22,765
If he gets his hands, on
all six Stones, Tony...

150
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:26,671
He can destroy life on a scale
of hitherto hundredth of.

151
00:14:26,696 --> 00:14:28,547
Did you seriously just say
"hitherto hundredth of"?

152
00:14:28,571 --> 00:14:30,904
Are you seriously leaning on
the Cauldron of the Cosmos?

153
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:32,015
Is that what that is?

154
00:14:34,923 --> 00:14:36,962
I'm going to allow that.

155
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,185
If Thanos needs all six,

156
00:14:40,285 --> 00:14:42,318
why don't we just stick this
one down the garbage disposal?

157
00:14:42,418 --> 00:14:43,153
No can do.

158
00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:46,394
We swore an oath to protect
the Time Stone with our lives.

159
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:49,769
And I swore off dairy, but Ben &
Jerry's named a flavor after me, so...

160
00:14:49,778 --> 00:14:51,557
- Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
- It's not bad.

161
00:14:51,582 --> 00:14:52,833
A bit chalky.

162
00:14:53,033 --> 00:14:54,832
"A Hunka-Hulka Burning
Fudge" is our favorite.

163
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,519
- That's a thing?
- Whatever. Point is, things change.

164
00:14:57,528 --> 00:15:00,200
Our oath to protect the
Time Stone cannot change.

165
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,415
This Stone may be the best
chance we have against Thanos.

166
00:15:02,515 --> 00:15:05,474
And still conversely, it may also be
his best chance against us!

167
00:15:05,499 --> 00:15:07,144
Only if we don't do our jobs.

168
00:15:07,169 --> 00:15:10,294
What is your job exactly,
besides making balloon animals?

169
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,422
Protecting your
reality, douche bag.

170
00:15:13,447 --> 00:15:16,587
Okay guys, can we quick cable
this discussion right now?

171
00:15:16,612 --> 00:15:19,986
The fact is we have the stone.
We know where it is.

172
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:22,471
Vision is out there somewhere
with the Mind Stone.

173
00:15:22,474 --> 00:15:24,503
And we have to find him now.

174
00:15:24,948 --> 00:15:27,596
- Yeah, that's the thing.
- What do you mean?

175
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:31,057
Two weeks ago, Vision turned off
his transponder. He's offline.

176
00:15:31,066 --> 00:15:32,245
What?

177
00:15:32,418 --> 00:15:36,041
- Tony, you lost another super bot?
- I didn't lose him. He's more than that.

178
00:15:36,066 --> 00:15:38,964
- He's evolving.
- Who could find Vision, then?

179
00:15:43,188 --> 00:15:45,789
- Probably Steve Rogers.
- Oh, great.

180
00:15:45,813 --> 00:15:48,586
Maybe. But...

181
00:15:52,126 --> 00:15:53,751
Call him.

182
00:15:53,946 --> 00:15:55,711
It's not that easy.

183
00:15:56,251 --> 00:15:58,628
God, we haven't caught up in a spell,
have we?

184
00:15:59,335 --> 00:16:01,642
The Avengers broke up.
We're toast.

185
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,383
Broke up?

186
00:16:04,735 --> 00:16:09,149
- Like a band? Like The Beatles?
- Cap and I fell out hard.

187
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,977
We're not on speaking terms.

188
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:15,274
Tony, listen to me.

189
00:16:15,978 --> 00:16:18,305
Thor's gone.

190
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,860
Thanos is coming. It doesn't matter
who you're talking to or not.

191
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:04,574
Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to
be moving your hair, would you?

192
00:17:04,667 --> 00:17:07,089
Not at the moment, no.

193
00:17:39,223 --> 00:17:40,683
You okay?

194
00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:45,176
- Help him. Wong, Doc.
- Got it.

195
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:48,208
- Friday, what am I looking at?
- Not sure. I'm working on it.

196
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,654
You better not put that Time
Stone in your back pocket, Doc!

197
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,576
I might wanna use it.

198
00:18:20,077 --> 00:18:22,796
Ned, hey. I need you
to cause a distraction.

199
00:18:22,806 --> 00:18:24,116
Holy shit!

200
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:28,646
We're all gonna die!
There's a spaceship!

201
00:18:36,997 --> 00:18:38,549
What's the matter with you kids?

202
00:18:38,588 --> 00:18:41,098
You never seen a spaceship before?

203
00:18:52,554 --> 00:18:56,600
Friday, evac anyone south of 43rd
Street, notify first responders.

204
00:18:56,616 --> 00:18:57,780
Will do.

205
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:29,271
Hear me, and rejoice!

206
00:19:30,116 --> 00:19:34,428
You are about to die at the hands
of the Children of Thanos.

207
00:19:34,732 --> 00:19:39,349
Be thankful, that your meaningless
lives are now contributing to...

208
00:19:39,365 --> 00:19:42,396
I'm sorry, Earth is closed today.

209
00:19:42,412 --> 00:19:45,243
You better pack it up
and get outta here.

210
00:19:45,343 --> 00:19:46,755
Stone keeper...

211
00:19:47,146 --> 00:19:49,468
Does this chattering
animal speak for you?

212
00:19:49,493 --> 00:19:51,424
Certainly not. I speak for myself.

213
00:19:51,702 --> 00:19:54,953
There's no trespassing in
this city and on this planet.

214
00:19:55,141 --> 00:19:58,571
- You need to get lost, Squidward!
- They exhaust me.

215
00:19:58,641 --> 00:20:00,445
Bring me the Stone.

216
00:20:01,782 --> 00:20:03,836
Hey, do you want a piece?

217
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:08,117
No, not really. But when
do I ever get what I want.

218
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:13,835
Been a while. Good
to have you, buddy.

219
00:20:14,302 --> 00:20:17,686
I just... I need to
concentrate for a second.

220
00:20:17,711 --> 00:20:19,669
Come on, come on, Max.

221
00:20:22,338 --> 00:20:24,548
Where's your guy?

222
00:20:25,018 --> 00:20:26,791
I don't know. We're
certainly having a thing.

223
00:20:26,816 --> 00:20:30,441
There's no time for a thing. That's
the thing right there. Let's go.

224
00:20:36,521 --> 00:20:39,239
Dude, you're embarrassing me
in front of the wizards.

225
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,739
- I can't... He won't...
- It's okay. Stand down.

226
00:20:41,764 --> 00:20:44,006
- Can I leave you with him? Thank you.
- I have him.

227
00:21:12,468 --> 00:21:17,068
- Where'd that come from?
- It's nano-tech. You like it? A little...

228
00:21:19,617 --> 00:21:23,410
Dr. Banner, if the rest of your
green friend won't be joining us...

229
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:35,767
- You gotta get that stone outta here, now.
- It stays with me.

230
00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:37,424
Exactly. Bye!

231
00:21:46,395 --> 00:21:49,191
Tony, you okay? How we doing?
Good, bad?

232
00:21:49,216 --> 00:21:51,397
Really good. Do you plan on helping out?

233
00:21:51,497 --> 00:21:53,410
I'm trying. He won't come out.

234
00:22:03,066 --> 00:22:05,949
Come on, Hulk. What
are you doing?

235
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:08,394
Come on. Come on! Come on!

236
00:22:08,425 --> 00:22:10,862
No!

237
00:22:14,425 --> 00:22:17,339
What do you mean, "no"?

238
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:25,222
- Hey, man! What's up, Mr. Stark?
- Kid, where'd you come from?

239
00:22:25,246 --> 00:22:27,441
The field trip.

240
00:22:28,426 --> 00:22:31,131
What is this guy's problem, Mr.
Stark?

241
00:22:31,156 --> 00:22:34,757
He's from space, came here to
steal a necklace from a wizard.

242
00:23:00,907 --> 00:23:05,602
Your powers are quaint. You
must be popular with children.

243
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:09,733
It's a simple spell
but quite unbreakable.

244
00:23:09,733 --> 00:23:11,944
Then I'll take it
off your corpse.

245
00:23:23,979 --> 00:23:29,760
You wouldn't. Removing a dead
man's spell... Troublesome.

246
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:32,158
You'll only wish you were dead.

247
00:23:41,777 --> 00:23:43,199
No!

248
00:23:46,574 --> 00:23:49,167
- Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.
- On it!

249
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,669
Not cool.

250
00:24:13,803 --> 00:24:18,693
- Mr. Stark? I'm being beamed up.
- Hang on, kid.

251
00:24:38,338 --> 00:24:41,166
Wong, you're invited
to my wedding.

252
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:49,927
Give me a little juice, Friday.

253
00:24:57,843 --> 00:25:00,022
Unlock 17-A.

254
00:25:12,247 --> 00:25:14,879
Kid, you gotta let go.
I'm gonna catch you.

255
00:25:14,891 --> 00:25:16,731
But you said save the wizard!

256
00:25:16,778 --> 00:25:18,552
I can't breathe!

257
00:25:18,577 --> 00:25:21,317
You're too high up. You're
running out of air.

258
00:25:22,481 --> 00:25:24,738
That makes sense.

259
00:25:40,846 --> 00:25:43,122
Mr. Stark, it smells
like a new car in here.

260
00:25:43,147 --> 00:25:46,420
- Happy trails, kid. Friday, send him home.
- Yup.

261
00:25:46,428 --> 00:25:48,037
Oh, come on!

262
00:25:55,961 --> 00:25:58,257
Boss, incoming call
from Miss Potts.

263
00:25:58,283 --> 00:26:00,783
Tony? Oh, my God. Are you all right?
What's going on?

264
00:26:00,808 --> 00:26:03,814
Yeah, I'm fine. I just think we
might have to push our 8:30 res.

265
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,532
Why?

266
00:26:04,532 --> 00:26:07,877
Just 'cause I'll probably
not make it back for awhile.

267
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,682
- Tell me you're not on that ship.
- Yeah.

268
00:26:10,707 --> 00:26:13,032
God, no. Please tell me
you're not on that ship.

269
00:26:13,044 --> 00:26:14,464
Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

270
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,927
I don't know how to say this. Pep...

271
00:26:16,027 --> 00:26:17,855
Come back here, Tony. I swear to God...
Come back here right now!

272
00:26:18,769 --> 00:26:20,143
Come back!

273
00:26:20,144 --> 00:26:24,690
Boss, we're losing her.
I'm going, too...

274
00:26:33,183 --> 00:26:35,464
Oh, my God.

275
00:26:38,871 --> 00:26:41,676
I should have stayed on the bus.

276
00:26:55,162 --> 00:26:58,591
- Where you going?
- Time Stone's been taken.

277
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:00,906
The Sanctum remains unguarded.

278
00:27:01,106 --> 00:27:02,404
What will you do?

279
00:27:03,096 --> 00:27:06,017
I'm gonna make a call.

280
00:27:45,137 --> 00:27:47,183
Sing it, Drax!

281
00:27:58,995 --> 00:28:00,549
Why are we doing this again?

282
00:28:00,574 --> 00:28:03,269
It's a distress signal, Rocket.
Someone could be dying.

283
00:28:03,294 --> 00:28:07,277
- I get that, but why are we doing it?
- 'Cause we're nice.

284
00:28:07,441 --> 00:28:10,225
And maybe whoever it is will give us a
little cheddar cheese for our help...

285
00:28:10,249 --> 00:28:13,840
- Which isn't the point.
- Which isn't the point... I mean...

286
00:28:13,865 --> 00:28:16,000
- If he doesn't pony up...
- We'll take his ship.

287
00:28:16,025 --> 00:28:19,974
- Exactly! Alright!
- B-b-b-bingo!

288
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,153
We are arriving.

289
00:28:24,178 --> 00:28:26,644
All right, Guardians.
Don't forget, this might

290
00:28:26,656 --> 00:28:29,082
be dangerous, so let's
put on our mean faces.

291
00:28:33,861 --> 00:28:37,677
Groot, put that thing away. Now.
I don't wanna tell you again. Groot.

292
00:28:37,686 --> 00:28:39,357
I am Groot!

293
00:28:39,381 --> 00:28:41,662
- Whoa! Language!
- Wow!

294
00:28:41,687 --> 00:28:43,506
You got some acorns on you, kid.

295
00:28:43,531 --> 00:28:47,015
Ever since you got little
sap, you're a total d-hole.

296
00:28:47,047 --> 00:28:50,750
Keep it up, and I'm gonna
smash that thing to pieces!

297
00:28:57,492 --> 00:29:00,195
What happened?

298
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:05,238
Oh, my God.

299
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,691
Looks like we're
not getting paid.

300
00:29:14,402 --> 00:29:17,745
Wipers! Wipers! Get it off.

301
00:29:24,069 --> 00:29:27,123
How the hell is this
dude still alive?

302
00:29:27,147 --> 00:29:30,772
He is not a dude. You're a dude.

303
00:29:30,874 --> 00:29:34,389
This... This is a man.

304
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:38,085
- Handsome, muscular man.
- I'm muscular.

305
00:29:38,093 --> 00:29:41,085
Who are you kidding, Quill? You're
one sandwich away from fat.

306
00:29:41,093 --> 00:29:45,162
- Yeah, right. What?
- It's true. You have little weight...

307
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,123
Gamora, do you think I'm...

308
00:29:51,272 --> 00:29:54,227
He is anxious. Angry.

309
00:29:54,427 --> 00:29:58,373
He feels tremendous
loss and guilt.

310
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:01,555
It's like a pirate had
a baby with an angel.

311
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,346
Wow. This is a real wake-up
call for me. Okay.

312
00:30:04,371 --> 00:30:05,616
I'm gonna get a Bowflex.

313
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,325
I'm gonna commit.
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

314
00:30:08,421 --> 00:30:09,981
You know you can't eat
dumbbells, right?

315
00:30:10,122 --> 00:30:13,869
It's like his muscles are
made of Cotati metal fiber.

316
00:30:13,881 --> 00:30:15,895
Stop massaging his muscles.

317
00:30:17,183 --> 00:30:19,018
Wake him up.

318
00:30:21,006 --> 00:30:22,249
Wake.

319
00:30:39,651 --> 00:30:42,291
Who the hell are you guys?

320
00:30:44,557 --> 00:30:48,424
The entire time I knew Thanos,
he only ever had one goal:

321
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:52,228
To bring balance to the Universe
by wiping out half of all life.

322
00:30:52,626 --> 00:30:57,307
He used to kill people planet by
planet, massacre by massacre.

323
00:30:57,323 --> 00:31:00,390
- Including my own.
- If he gets all six Infinity Stones,

324
00:31:00,429 --> 00:31:03,335
he can do it with the snap
of his fingers, like this.

325
00:31:03,652 --> 00:31:07,694
You seem to know a
great deal about Thanos.

326
00:31:07,706 --> 00:31:11,144
Gamora... is the
daughter of Thanos.

327
00:31:14,302 --> 00:31:17,715
- Your father killed my brother.
- Oh, boy.

328
00:31:17,716 --> 00:31:22,380
Stepfather. Technically, she
hates him as much as you do.

329
00:31:25,006 --> 00:31:26,335
Thanos can be tough.

330
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:30,551
Look. Before my father died,
he told me I had a half-sister...

331
00:31:30,576 --> 00:31:33,703
that he imprisoned in Hell.
Then she returned

332
00:31:33,715 --> 00:31:37,364
home, and stabbed me in the eye,
so... I had to kill her.

333
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:39,367
It's life, there was nothing else.

334
00:31:41,936 --> 00:31:45,320
- And I feel your pain.
- I feel your pain, as well.

335
00:31:45,345 --> 00:31:47,900
I mean it's not a competition,
but I've been through a lot.

336
00:31:47,925 --> 00:31:52,956
My father killed my mother, then I had
to kill my father. And that was hard.

337
00:31:52,972 --> 00:31:55,920
Probably even harder than
having to kill a sister.

338
00:31:55,945 --> 00:31:59,179
Plus, I, came out
with both of my eyes.

339
00:31:59,195 --> 00:32:01,952
I need a hammer, not a spoon...

340
00:32:02,508 --> 00:32:03,895
How do I open this thing?

341
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:07,977
Is there some sort of a
four-digit code maybe...

342
00:32:08,177 --> 00:32:11,024
- Maybe a birth date or something...
- What are you doing?

343
00:32:11,025 --> 00:32:12,272
Taking your pod.

344
00:32:13,768 --> 00:32:15,572
No, you're not!

345
00:32:16,686 --> 00:32:21,646
You'll not, be taking
our pod today, sir.

346
00:32:22,178 --> 00:32:25,293
Quill. Are you making your voice deeper?

347
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,242
- No.
- You are.

348
00:32:28,442 --> 00:32:31,211
You're imitating the god-man.
It's weird.

349
00:32:31,236 --> 00:32:33,546
- No I'm not.
- He just did it again!

350
00:32:33,571 --> 00:32:36,525
This is my voice!

351
00:32:40,607 --> 00:32:43,810
- Are you mocking me?
- Are you mocking me?

352
00:32:43,835 --> 00:32:45,913
You just did it again.

353
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,006
He's trying to copy me.

354
00:32:48,031 --> 00:32:51,389
Enough! We need to stop Thanos.

355
00:32:51,414 --> 00:32:54,209
Which means we need to find
out where he's going next.

356
00:32:54,221 --> 00:32:55,241
Nowhere.

357
00:32:55,422 --> 00:33:00,007
- He must be going somewhere.
- No. Nowhere? It's a place.

358
00:33:00,023 --> 00:33:01,681
We've been there. It sucks.

359
00:33:01,881 --> 00:33:03,539
Excuse me, that's our food.

360
00:33:03,555 --> 00:33:05,844
- Not anymore.
- Thor...

361
00:33:05,869 --> 00:33:08,421
Why would he go to nowhere?

362
00:33:08,446 --> 00:33:11,293
Because for years,
reality stone has been safely stored,

363
00:33:11,493 --> 00:33:13,564
there with a man
we call the collector.

364
00:33:13,788 --> 00:33:15,543
If it's with the Collector,
then it's not safe.

365
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,368
Only an idiot would
give that man a stone.

366
00:33:17,411 --> 00:33:18,420
Or a genius.

367
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,231
How do you know he's not going
for one of the other stones?

368
00:33:21,364 --> 00:33:24,192
There's six stones out there.

369
00:33:24,208 --> 00:33:28,052
Thanos already has the Power Stone
because he stole it last week,

370
00:33:28,077 --> 00:33:29,996
when he decimated Xandar.

371
00:33:30,196 --> 00:33:32,321
He stole the Space Stone from me.

372
00:33:32,336 --> 00:33:35,281
When he destroyed my ship and
slaughtered half my people.

373
00:33:35,306 --> 00:33:38,290
The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth.
They're with the Avengers.

374
00:33:38,315 --> 00:33:40,636
- The Avengers?
- They're Earth's Mightiest Heroes.

375
00:33:40,661 --> 00:33:43,638
- Like Kevin Bacon?
- He may be on the team. I don't know.

376
00:33:43,838 --> 00:33:44,870
Haven't been there in a while.

377
00:33:45,224 --> 00:33:47,161
As for the Soul Stone,
no one's ever seen that.

378
00:33:47,361 --> 00:33:48,666
No one even knows where it is.

379
00:33:48,737 --> 00:33:52,244
Therefore, Thanos can't get it.
Therefore, he's going to Nowhere.

380
00:33:52,253 --> 00:33:55,666
Hence, he'll be getting the Reality Stone.
You're welcome.

381
00:33:55,682 --> 00:33:58,697
- Then we have to go to Nowhere now.
- Wrong.

382
00:33:58,706 --> 00:34:02,308
- Where we have to go, is Nivadellir.
- That's a made up word.

383
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:06,372
- Oh what's made up?
- Nidavellir is real? Seriously?

384
00:34:06,756 --> 00:34:09,455
I mean, that place is a legend. They
make the most powerful,

385
00:34:09,467 --> 00:34:11,872
horrific weapons to ever
torment the Universe.

386
00:34:11,897 --> 00:34:14,047
I would very much like
to go there, please.

387
00:34:14,072 --> 00:34:16,327
The rabbit is correct, and
clearly the smartest one.

388
00:34:16,747 --> 00:34:17,648
Rabbit?

389
00:34:17,671 --> 00:34:20,181
Only Eitri the dwarf king can
make me the weapon I need.

390
00:34:20,205 --> 00:34:22,623
- I assume you're the captain, sir?
- You're very perceptive.

391
00:34:22,648 --> 00:34:25,866
You seem like a noble leader. Will you
join me on my quest to Nivadellir?

392
00:34:25,891 --> 00:34:29,669
Lemme just ask the captain. Wait a
second, it's me! Yeah, I'll go.

393
00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:32,312
- Wonderful.
- Except that I'm the captain.

394
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:33,868
- Quiet!
- And that's my backpack.

395
00:34:33,892 --> 00:34:36,469
- Quill, sit down.
- Look, this is my ship.

396
00:34:36,485 --> 00:34:38,203
And I'm not going to...

397
00:34:39,195 --> 00:34:41,609
Wait, what kind of weapon
are we talking about here?

398
00:34:41,618 --> 00:34:43,625
The Thanos killing kind.

399
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,496
Don't you think that we should
all have a weapon like that?

400
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,691
No. You simply lack the
strength to wield them.

401
00:34:47,708 --> 00:34:50,251
Your bodies will crumble as you
minds collapse to the madness.

402
00:34:50,275 --> 00:34:52,160
Is it weird that I wanna
do it even more now?

403
00:34:52,172 --> 00:34:53,295
A little bit. Yeah.

404
00:34:53,495 --> 00:34:56,144
If we don't go to Nowhere and
Thanos retrieves another stone,

405
00:34:56,168 --> 00:34:58,714
- he'll be too powerful to stop.
- He already is.

406
00:34:58,738 --> 00:35:00,525
I got it figured out.

407
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:04,042
We got two ships, and the
largest go with the morons.

408
00:35:04,059 --> 00:35:06,366
So me and Groot will go
with the pirate-angel here,

409
00:35:06,391 --> 00:35:09,711
and the morons will go to
Nowhere to try and stop Thanos.

410
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:12,305
- Cool? Cool.
- So cool.

411
00:35:12,329 --> 00:35:14,078
For the record...

412
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:16,798
I know that you're only going with
him because it's where Thanos isn't.

413
00:35:16,822 --> 00:35:21,173
You know, you shouldn't talk
that way to your captain, Quill.

414
00:35:21,564 --> 00:35:23,383
Come on, Groot.

415
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:26,040
Put that game down.
You'll rot your brain.

416
00:35:30,363 --> 00:35:33,941
I bid you farewell and
good luck, morons. Bye.

417
00:35:48,657 --> 00:35:49,790
Vis?

418
00:35:50,334 --> 00:35:52,092
Is it the stone again?

419
00:35:52,138 --> 00:35:54,375
It's as if it's speaking to me.

420
00:35:54,626 --> 00:35:56,618
What does it say?

421
00:35:57,267 --> 00:36:00,556
I don't... I don't know.
Something...

422
00:36:12,908 --> 00:36:15,283
Tell me what you feel.

423
00:36:22,396 --> 00:36:25,762
I just feel you.

424
00:36:33,588 --> 00:36:35,540
So there's a 10 AM to Glasgow

425
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,884
to give us more time together
before you went back.

426
00:36:37,916 --> 00:36:40,908
- What if I miss that train?
- There is an 11.

427
00:36:40,939 --> 00:36:43,689
What if I missed all the trains?

428
00:36:44,588 --> 00:36:46,681
What if this time,
I didn't go back?

429
00:36:46,706 --> 00:36:49,331
- You gave Stark your word.
- I'd rather give it to you.

430
00:36:49,356 --> 00:36:52,801
There are people who are expecting me
too, you know. We both made promises.

431
00:36:52,809 --> 00:36:54,496
Not to each other.

432
00:36:55,334 --> 00:36:56,777
Wanda...

433
00:36:56,928 --> 00:37:00,716
Two years, we've stolen these moments,
trying to see if this could work.

434
00:37:00,741 --> 00:37:05,302
And... I don't know. You know what,
I'm just gonna speak for myself.

435
00:37:05,327 --> 00:37:09,819
- I, I... I think... It works.
- It works. It works.

436
00:37:12,257 --> 00:37:14,061
Stay.

437
00:37:21,019 --> 00:37:24,214
Or not. If I'm overstepping...

438
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,252
What are they?

439
00:37:33,362 --> 00:37:36,549
What the stone was
warning me about.

440
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:50,317
- I have to go.
- No. Vision. If that's true...

441
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:53,427
Then maybe going isn't
the best idea.

442
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,607
Wanda, I...

443
00:38:25,154 --> 00:38:28,481
The blade. It stopped
me from phasing.

444
00:38:28,865 --> 00:38:32,265
- Is that even possible?
- It isn't supposed to be.

445
00:38:39,703 --> 00:38:41,187
Vis!

446
00:38:49,835 --> 00:38:53,897
Give up the Stone,
and she lives.

447
00:39:31,114 --> 00:39:32,590
Hands off.

448
00:39:49,628 --> 00:39:53,620
Come on. You gotta get up.
You gotta get up. Come on.

449
00:39:55,307 --> 00:39:57,689
We have to go.

450
00:39:59,526 --> 00:40:03,017
- Please leave.
- You asked me to stay.

451
00:40:03,932 --> 00:40:06,182
I'm staying.

452
00:41:16,467 --> 00:41:18,193
- Get up.
- I can't.

453
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,037
We don't wanna kill you.
But we will.

454
00:41:21,084 --> 00:41:24,162
You'll never get
the chance again.

455
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,822
Can you stand?

456
00:41:45,579 --> 00:41:48,407
Thank you, Captain.

457
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,118
Let's get you on the jet.

458
00:41:55,345 --> 00:41:58,486
I thought
we had a deal.

459
00:41:58,541 --> 00:42:02,400
Stay close, check in.
Don't take any chances.

460
00:42:02,494 --> 00:42:06,501
I'm sorry. We just wanted time.

461
00:42:08,689 --> 00:42:10,783
Where to, Cap?

462
00:42:12,916 --> 00:42:14,556
Home.

463
00:42:17,587 --> 00:42:19,805
We'll be safe.

464
00:42:44,341 --> 00:42:47,021
- Zen-Whoberians...
- Mother!

465
00:42:47,061 --> 00:42:50,334
- Choose a side, or die.
- Mother!

466
00:42:50,825 --> 00:42:55,926
One side, for reservation.
The other, an honor...

467
00:42:56,973 --> 00:42:59,276
What's wrong, little one?

468
00:42:59,301 --> 00:43:03,269
My mother. Where is my mother?

469
00:43:07,065 --> 00:43:09,303
What's your name?

470
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:11,819
Gamora.

471
00:43:11,952 --> 00:43:15,272
You're quite the
fighter, Gamora.

472
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:19,568
Come. Let me help you.

473
00:43:31,397 --> 00:43:33,287
Look.

474
00:43:36,241 --> 00:43:40,365
Pretty, isn't it?
Perfectly balanced.

475
00:43:40,397 --> 00:43:42,506
As all things should be.

476
00:43:42,538 --> 00:43:47,482
Too much to one side,
or the other...

477
00:43:49,783 --> 00:43:53,704
Here. You try.

478
00:43:56,754 --> 00:44:01,160
Now go in peace, and
meet your maker.

479
00:44:04,954 --> 00:44:07,492
Concentrate.

480
00:44:09,485 --> 00:44:13,616
There! You've got it.

481
00:44:21,817 --> 00:44:23,504
Gamora.

482
00:44:23,837 --> 00:44:27,973
You know these grenades are the
"blow off your junk" kind or the gas kind?

483
00:44:27,996 --> 00:44:30,675
'Cause I was thinking I might hang
a couple on my belt right here.

484
00:44:30,699 --> 00:44:33,722
- But I don't want to...
- I need to ask a favor.

485
00:44:33,746 --> 00:44:35,652
Yeah, sure.

486
00:44:36,566 --> 00:44:40,499
One way or another, the path
that we're on leads to Thanos.

487
00:44:41,699 --> 00:44:44,425
Which is what the
grenades are for.

488
00:44:44,652 --> 00:44:46,852
I'm sorry. What's the favor?

489
00:44:48,416 --> 00:44:50,955
If things go wrong...

490
00:44:51,244 --> 00:44:53,814
If Thanos gets me...

491
00:44:57,909 --> 00:45:02,401
I want you to promise me...
you'll kill me.

492
00:45:02,479 --> 00:45:04,190
What?

493
00:45:06,839 --> 00:45:09,807
I know something he doesn't.

494
00:45:11,808 --> 00:45:13,979
If he finds it out...

495
00:45:14,004 --> 00:45:17,300
- The entire Universe could be at risk.
- What do you know?

496
00:45:17,324 --> 00:45:20,230
If I tell you, you'd know, too.

497
00:45:22,204 --> 00:45:25,938
If it's so important,
shouldn't I?

498
00:45:25,963 --> 00:45:27,131
Only if you wanna die.

499
00:45:27,143 --> 00:45:29,994
Why does somebody always
have to die in this scenario?

500
00:45:30,072 --> 00:45:31,502
Just...

501
00:45:33,206 --> 00:45:36,502
trust me. And
possibly, kill me.

502
00:45:36,534 --> 00:45:40,846
I mean, I'd like to.
I really would...

503
00:45:40,994 --> 00:45:43,205
Swear to me.

504
00:45:45,775 --> 00:45:48,660
Swear to me on your mother.

505
00:45:55,269 --> 00:45:57,081
Okay.

506
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:22,582
Dude! How long have you
been standing there?

507
00:46:22,606 --> 00:46:25,348
- An hour.
- An hour?

508
00:46:25,403 --> 00:46:27,066
Are you serious?

509
00:46:27,083 --> 00:46:32,887
I've mastered the ability, of
standing so incredibly still...

510
00:46:33,278 --> 00:46:37,886
That I've become invisible
to the eye. Watch.

511
00:46:41,267 --> 00:46:45,344
- You're eating a zark nut.
- But my movement...

512
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:47,766
So slow...

513
00:46:47,814 --> 00:46:52,102
- And it's imperceptible.
- No.

514
00:46:52,157 --> 00:46:55,071
- I'm sure I'm invisible.
- Hi, Drax.

515
00:46:57,485 --> 00:46:59,149
Damn it.

516
00:47:18,303 --> 00:47:21,919
- This place looks deserted.
- I'm reading movement.

517
00:47:21,944 --> 00:47:25,686
- From the third quadrant.
- Yeah. I'm picking that up, too.

518
00:47:26,632 --> 00:47:29,398
Let's put it down over here.

519
00:47:58,053 --> 00:48:00,733
I know you have the Reality Stone.

520
00:48:00,963 --> 00:48:05,568
Giving it to me will spare you
a great deal of suffering.

521
00:48:08,368 --> 00:48:12,578
I told you. I sold it.

522
00:48:14,512 --> 00:48:19,746
- Why would I lie?
- I imagine it's like breathing for you.

523
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:24,050
- Like suicide.
- So you do understand.

524
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:26,933
Not even you will surrender
something so precious.

525
00:48:26,965 --> 00:48:29,097
I didn't know what it was.

526
00:48:29,105 --> 00:48:32,238
Then you're more of a
fool than I took you for.

527
00:48:32,246 --> 00:48:35,300
Last chance, Charlotte.

528
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:38,110
Where's the Stone?

529
00:48:38,227 --> 00:48:43,211
Today, he pays for the deaths
of my wife and daughter.

530
00:48:43,243 --> 00:48:44,859
Drax, wait!

531
00:48:45,368 --> 00:48:47,602
Whoa, not yet!

532
00:48:54,257 --> 00:48:57,069
He doesn't have the Stone yet.

533
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:59,405
We get it, and then
we can stop him.

534
00:48:59,446 --> 00:49:02,289
We have to get the Stone first.
Yeah.

535
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:07,719
No. No. For Ovette.
For Camaria.

536
00:49:07,751 --> 00:49:09,633
Sleep.

537
00:49:20,857 --> 00:49:26,075
Okay. Gamora, Mantis,
you go right.

538
00:49:26,091 --> 00:49:29,395
I'm... The other right!

539
00:49:52,673 --> 00:49:55,251
Why?

540
00:50:04,227 --> 00:50:08,680
Why you? Daughter...

541
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:29,344
That was quick.

542
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:39,317
Magnificent! Magnificent!

543
00:50:41,184 --> 00:50:44,825
Is it sadness I sense
in you, daughter?

544
00:50:46,997 --> 00:50:50,622
In my heart, I knew
you still cared.

545
00:50:56,828 --> 00:51:00,007
No one ever knows for sure.

546
00:51:09,384 --> 00:51:12,970
Reality is often disappointing.

547
00:51:15,433 --> 00:51:18,675
That is, it was.

548
00:51:19,667 --> 00:51:21,253
Now...

549
00:51:23,102 --> 00:51:26,555
Reality can be whatever I want.

550
00:51:27,219 --> 00:51:30,820
- You knew I'd come.
- I counted on it.

551
00:51:31,246 --> 00:51:35,074
There's something we need
to discuss, little one.

552
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:40,877
Thanos!

553
00:51:53,807 --> 00:51:57,533
- Let her go, Grimace!
- Peter...

554
00:51:58,214 --> 00:52:01,057
- I told you to go right.
- Now...

555
00:52:01,096 --> 00:52:05,588
- You let her go!
- Ah, the boyfriend.

556
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:10,509
I like to think of myself more as a
Titan-killing long term booty call.

557
00:52:10,533 --> 00:52:12,494
- Let her go.
- Peter...

558
00:52:12,518 --> 00:52:17,166
Or I'm gonna blow that nut-sack
of a chin right off your face!

559
00:52:17,565 --> 00:52:20,486
Not him.

560
00:52:29,669 --> 00:52:32,598
You promised!

561
00:52:37,726 --> 00:52:42,155
Oh, daughter. You expect
too much from him.

562
00:52:45,442 --> 00:52:48,379
She's asked, hasn't she?

563
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,457
Do it.

564
00:52:58,192 --> 00:53:00,027
Do it!

565
00:53:06,605 --> 00:53:09,230
I told you to go right!

566
00:53:09,926 --> 00:53:13,097
I love you, more than anything.

567
00:53:16,003 --> 00:53:18,645
I love you, too.

568
00:53:31,631 --> 00:53:33,560
I like you.

569
00:54:03,654 --> 00:54:05,387
Still no word from Vision?

570
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:08,076
Satellites lost him
somewhere over Edinburgh.

571
00:54:08,092 --> 00:54:12,060
On a stolen quinjet with four of
the world's most wanted criminals.

572
00:54:12,076 --> 00:54:13,282
You know they're only criminals

573
00:54:13,482 --> 00:54:15,506
because you've chosen to call them that,
right, sir?

574
00:54:15,531 --> 00:54:19,946
My God, Rhodes, your talent
for horseshit rivals my own.

575
00:54:19,969 --> 00:54:23,413
If it weren't for those Accords,
Vision would've been right here.

576
00:54:23,421 --> 00:54:26,921
I remember your signature
on those papers, Colonel.

577
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:28,778
That's right.

578
00:54:30,425 --> 00:54:32,178
And I'm pretty sure
I've paid for that.

579
00:54:32,203 --> 00:54:35,507
- Do you have second thoughts?
- Not anymore.

580
00:54:41,153 --> 00:54:44,426
Mr. Secretary.

581
00:54:47,099 --> 00:54:50,817
You got some nerve.
I'll give you that.

582
00:54:51,273 --> 00:54:53,786
You could use some
of that right now.

583
00:54:53,919 --> 00:54:56,817
The world's on fire.

584
00:54:56,896 --> 00:55:00,474
And you think, all is forgiven?

585
00:55:00,568 --> 00:55:05,333
I'm not looking for forgiveness. And
I'm way past asking for permission.

586
00:55:06,451 --> 00:55:11,434
Earth just lost her best defender.
So we're here to fight.

587
00:55:11,747 --> 00:55:14,356
And if you wanna
stand in our way...

588
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:17,099
We'll fight you, too.

589
00:55:20,158 --> 00:55:23,720
- Arrest them.
- All over it.

590
00:55:28,876 --> 00:55:31,086
That's a court-martial.

591
00:55:32,844 --> 00:55:36,548
- It's great to see you, Cap.
- You too, Rhodey.

592
00:55:36,573 --> 00:55:37,902
Hey.

593
00:55:39,643 --> 00:55:44,213
Well. You guys, really
look like crap.

594
00:55:44,268 --> 00:55:46,033
Must've been a rough
couple of years.

595
00:55:46,049 --> 00:55:49,181
Yeah, well, the hotels
weren't exactly five star.

596
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:51,494
I think you look great.

597
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,655
Yeah. I'm back.

598
00:56:01,929 --> 00:56:03,538
Hi, Bruce.

599
00:56:08,456 --> 00:56:10,034
Nat.

600
00:56:12,854 --> 00:56:15,424
This is awkward.

601
00:56:16,888 --> 00:56:18,789
We gotta assume they're
coming back, right?

602
00:56:18,801 --> 00:56:20,131
And they can clearly find us.

603
00:56:20,146 --> 00:56:22,575
We need all hands on deck.
Where's Clint?

604
00:56:22,583 --> 00:56:24,951
After the whole Accords
situation, he and Scott

605
00:56:24,963 --> 00:56:27,293
took a deal. It's too
tough on their families.

606
00:56:27,318 --> 00:56:28,864
- Who's Scott?
- Ant-Man.

607
00:56:28,888 --> 00:56:31,286
There's an Ant-Man
and a Spider-Man?

608
00:56:31,310 --> 00:56:32,310
Okay, look...

609
00:56:32,333 --> 00:56:35,333
Thanos has the biggest
army in the Universe.

610
00:56:35,349 --> 00:56:39,293
And he is not gonna
stop until he... He gets...

611
00:56:40,984 --> 00:56:41,991
Vision's stone.

612
00:56:42,016 --> 00:56:45,968
- Well then, we have to protect it.
- No, we have to destroy it.

613
00:56:47,309 --> 00:56:51,762
I've been giving a good deal of thought to
this entity in my head about its nature.

614
00:56:51,778 --> 00:56:54,043
But also, its composition.

615
00:56:54,086 --> 00:56:56,737
I think if it were exposed
to a sufficiently

616
00:56:56,749 --> 00:56:58,820
powerful energy
source, something,

617
00:56:58,845 --> 00:57:02,610
very similar to its own
signature, perhaps...

618
00:57:03,618 --> 00:57:06,540
Its molecular
integrity could fail.

619
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:08,993
And you, with it.

620
00:57:09,087 --> 00:57:10,743
We're not having
this conversation.

621
00:57:10,755 --> 00:57:13,344
Eliminating the stone is the
only way to be certain that

622
00:57:13,369 --> 00:57:17,937
- Thanos can't get it.
- That's too high a price.

623
00:57:21,873 --> 00:57:25,404
Only you, have the
power to pay it.

624
00:57:28,553 --> 00:57:30,695
Thanos threatens
half the Universe.

625
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:34,151
One life cannot stand in
the way of defeating him.

626
00:57:34,163 --> 00:57:35,310
But it should.

627
00:57:37,115 --> 00:57:38,546
We don't trade lives, Vision.

628
00:57:38,571 --> 00:57:42,929
Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down
your life to save millions of people.

629
00:57:42,954 --> 00:57:45,063
Tell me, why is
this any different?

630
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:48,430
Because you might have a choice.

631
00:57:48,696 --> 00:57:52,742
Your mind is made up of a
complex construct of overlays.

632
00:57:52,751 --> 00:57:56,487
Jarvis, Ultron, Tony,
me, the stone.

633
00:57:56,526 --> 00:58:00,320
All of them mixed together. All of
them learning from one another.

634
00:58:00,345 --> 00:58:03,515
- You're saying Vision isn't just a stone?
- I'm saying that...

635
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:07,250
If we take out the stone, there's
still a whole lot of Vision left.

636
00:58:07,259 --> 00:58:10,446
- Perhaps the best parts.
- Can we do that?

637
00:58:10,765 --> 00:58:12,499
Not me. Not here.

638
00:58:12,825 --> 00:58:15,843
Well you better find someone
and somewhere fast.

639
00:58:15,885 --> 00:58:19,760
Ross isn't just gonna let you
guys have your old rooms back.

640
00:58:21,268 --> 00:58:23,978
I know somewhere.

641
00:58:37,686 --> 00:58:40,527
The Kingsguard and the Dora
Milaje have been alerted.

642
00:58:40,552 --> 00:58:42,371
And the Border Tribe?

643
00:58:42,396 --> 00:58:43,840
Those that are left.

644
00:58:43,865 --> 00:58:46,583
Send word to the
Jabari as well.

645
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:49,185
M'Baku likes a good fight.

646
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:52,966
And what of this one?

647
00:58:53,215 --> 00:58:55,746
This one may be tired of war.

648
00:58:55,771 --> 00:58:59,692
But the White Wolf has
rested long enough.

649
00:59:21,517 --> 00:59:23,267
Where's the fight?

650
00:59:23,947 --> 00:59:25,735
On its way.

651
00:59:43,888 --> 00:59:47,395
In all the time I
have served Thanos...

652
00:59:48,322 --> 00:59:50,798
I have never failed him.

653
00:59:55,101 --> 00:59:58,499
If I were to reach our
rendezvous on Titan,

654
00:59:58,524 --> 01:00:02,281
with the Time Stone still attached
to your vaguely irritating person...

655
01:00:02,306 --> 01:00:05,188
There would be judgment.

656
01:00:13,629 --> 01:00:15,550
Give me...

657
01:00:19,396 --> 01:00:21,363
the Stone.

658
01:00:32,718 --> 01:00:35,655
Wow. You are a seriously
loyal piece of hardware.

659
01:00:35,671 --> 01:00:37,772
Speaking of loyalty...

660
01:00:38,132 --> 01:00:40,864
- I know what you're gonna say to me.
- You should not be here.

661
01:00:40,889 --> 01:00:41,889
- I was gonna go home.
- I don't wanna hear it!

662
01:00:41,905 --> 01:00:44,603
But it was such a long way
down and I just thought about...

663
01:00:44,615 --> 01:00:45,795
And now I gotta hear it.

664
01:00:45,819 --> 01:00:48,951
And this suit is, ridiculously
intuitive, by the way.

665
01:00:48,965 --> 01:00:52,076
So, if anything, its kind of
your fault that I'm here.

666
01:00:52,101 --> 01:00:53,702
- What did you just say?
- I take that back.

667
01:00:53,718 --> 01:00:55,265
And now I'm here in space.

668
01:00:55,277 --> 01:00:57,839
Yeah. Right where I
didn't want you to be.

669
01:00:57,886 --> 01:01:00,137
This isn't Coney Island,
or some field trip.

670
01:01:00,149 --> 01:01:02,261
This is a one-way ticket.
Do you hear me?

671
01:01:02,285 --> 01:01:05,529
- Don't pretend you thought this through.
- I did think this through.

672
01:01:05,554 --> 01:01:09,866
You can't be a friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man if there's no neighborhood.

673
01:01:11,218 --> 01:01:14,764
Okay, that didn't make sense but
you know what I'm trying to say.

674
01:01:16,419 --> 01:01:19,462
Come on. We got a situation.

675
01:01:19,614 --> 01:01:23,145
See him down there? He's in trouble.
What's your plan? Go.

676
01:01:23,669 --> 01:01:25,496
Okay, okay.

677
01:01:25,809 --> 01:01:28,637
OK, you ever see this
really old movie Aliens?

678
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:34,824
Painful, aren't they?

679
01:01:35,229 --> 01:01:38,644
They were originally
designed for microsurgery.

680
01:01:38,768 --> 01:01:40,986
And any one of them...

681
01:01:45,416 --> 01:01:48,462
I could end your friend's
life in an instant.

682
01:01:48,494 --> 01:01:50,611
I gotta tell you, he's
not really my friend.

683
01:01:50,619 --> 01:01:54,220
Saving his life is more of
a professional courtesy.

684
01:01:54,939 --> 01:01:56,791
You've saved nothing.

685
01:01:57,752 --> 01:02:01,345
Your powers are inconsequential
compared to mine.

686
01:02:01,361 --> 01:02:04,017
Yeah, but the kid's
seen more movies.

687
01:02:16,294 --> 01:02:17,926
Yes!

688
01:02:18,386 --> 01:02:20,449
Wait, what are those?

689
01:02:34,859 --> 01:02:37,234
Hey, we haven't officially met.

690
01:02:37,937 --> 01:02:39,070
Cool.

691
01:02:40,624 --> 01:02:44,483
- We gotta turn this ship around.
- Yeah. Now he wants to run.

692
01:02:44,499 --> 01:02:46,313
Great, I want to protect the stone.

693
01:02:46,338 --> 01:02:49,111
And I want you to thank me now.
Go ahead, I'm listening.

694
01:02:49,127 --> 01:02:52,095
For what? Nearly
blasting me to space?

695
01:02:52,104 --> 01:02:54,884
Who just saved your magical ass?
Me.

696
01:02:54,893 --> 01:02:57,136
I seriously don't know how you
fit your head into that helmet.

697
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:59,479
Admit it. You should've ducked
out when I told you to.

698
01:02:59,487 --> 01:03:01,307
I tried to bench
you, you refused.

699
01:03:01,332 --> 01:03:03,565
Unlike everyone else in your
life, I don't work for you.

700
01:03:03,590 --> 01:03:06,108
And due to that fact,
we're now in a flying doughnut,

701
01:03:06,308 --> 01:03:07,461
billions of miles from Earth,

702
01:03:07,521 --> 01:03:08,685
- with no back-up.
- I'm back-up!

703
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:11,688
No. You're a stowaway.
The adults are talking.

704
01:03:11,713 --> 01:03:15,954
I'm confused as to the relationship
here, I mean, what is he? Your ward?

705
01:03:15,979 --> 01:03:19,689
- No. I'm Peter, by the way.
- Doctor Strange.

706
01:03:19,714 --> 01:03:22,135
Oh, we're using our
made-up names.

707
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:23,972
I'm Spider-Man, then.

708
01:03:24,191 --> 01:03:26,949
The ship is self-correcting its course.
Thing's on autopilot.

709
01:03:26,974 --> 01:03:30,558
Can we control it? Fly us home?

710
01:03:33,883 --> 01:03:34,906
- Stark.
- Yeah?

711
01:03:34,930 --> 01:03:37,711
- Can you get us home?
- Yeah. Heard you.

712
01:03:38,961 --> 01:03:41,992
I'm not so sure we should.

713
01:03:42,102 --> 01:03:46,296
Under no circumstances can we
bring the Time Stone to Thanos.

714
01:03:46,367 --> 01:03:48,929
I don't think you quite
understand what's at stake here.

715
01:03:48,954 --> 01:03:51,288
No. It's you who doesn't
understand that

716
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:53,875
Thanos has been inside
my head for six years

717
01:03:53,907 --> 01:03:57,250
since he sent an army to New
York, and now he's back!

718
01:03:57,275 --> 01:03:59,345
And I don't know what to do.

719
01:03:59,504 --> 01:04:02,981
So I'm not so sure if it's a better
plan to fight him on our turf or his.

720
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:06,435
But you saw. What they
did, what they can do.

721
01:04:06,556 --> 01:04:09,087
At least, let's hope
he's not expecting it.

722
01:04:09,123 --> 01:04:13,195
So I say we take the
fight to him, Doctor.

723
01:04:14,553 --> 01:04:16,685
Do you concur?

724
01:04:18,703 --> 01:04:21,945
All right, Stark. We go to him.

725
01:04:22,211 --> 01:04:24,398
But you have to understand...

726
01:04:24,571 --> 01:04:29,071
If it comes to saving you, the
kid, or the Time Stone...

727
01:04:29,126 --> 01:04:32,721
I will not hesitate to
let either of you die.

728
01:04:32,746 --> 01:04:36,902
I can't. Because the
universe depends on it.

729
01:04:36,927 --> 01:04:40,403
Nice. Good. Moral compass.

730
01:04:43,253 --> 01:04:45,971
All right, kid...

731
01:04:46,855 --> 01:04:49,470
You're an Avenger now.

732
01:05:24,068 --> 01:05:26,771
I thought you might be hungry.

733
01:05:38,491 --> 01:05:40,732
I always hated that chair.

734
01:05:40,747 --> 01:05:42,545
So I've been told.

735
01:05:42,821 --> 01:05:47,196
Even so, I hoped you'd
sit in it one day.

736
01:05:47,629 --> 01:05:51,410
I hated this room, this ship...

737
01:05:51,556 --> 01:05:54,220
I hated my life.

738
01:05:57,469 --> 01:06:00,217
You told me that, too.

739
01:06:03,116 --> 01:06:05,358
Everyday.

740
01:06:07,323 --> 01:06:10,041
For almost twenty years.

741
01:06:11,546 --> 01:06:14,022
I was a child when you took me.

742
01:06:15,169 --> 01:06:17,544
I saved you.

743
01:06:20,013 --> 01:06:26,049
No. We were happy
on my home planet.

744
01:06:26,097 --> 01:06:29,963
Going to bed hungry?
Scrounging for scraps?

745
01:06:29,988 --> 01:06:34,878
Your planet was on the brink of collapse.
I'm the one who stopped that.

746
01:06:35,314 --> 01:06:37,478
You know what's happened since then?

747
01:06:37,511 --> 01:06:41,550
The children born, have
known nothing but full

748
01:06:41,562 --> 01:06:45,182
bellies and clear skies.
It's a paradise.

749
01:06:46,762 --> 01:06:49,176
Because you murdered
half the planet.

750
01:06:49,201 --> 01:06:51,982
A small price to
pay for salvation.

751
01:06:52,099 --> 01:06:55,396
- You're insane.
- Little one, it's a simple calculus.

752
01:06:55,421 --> 01:06:58,631
This universe is finite.
Its resources, finite.

753
01:06:58,656 --> 01:07:02,890
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.

754
01:07:03,161 --> 01:07:07,153
- It needs correction.
- You don't know that!

755
01:07:07,325 --> 01:07:10,200
I'm the only one who knows that.

756
01:07:10,208 --> 01:07:14,895
At least, I'm the only one
with the will to act on it.

757
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:18,841
For a time...

758
01:07:19,545 --> 01:07:20,685
You...

759
01:07:21,974 --> 01:07:24,200
had that same will,

760
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:29,873
as you fought by my side,
daughter.

761
01:07:30,509 --> 01:07:33,266
I'm not your daughter.

762
01:07:34,689 --> 01:07:37,946
Everything I hated about
myself, you taught me.

763
01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:42,238
And in doing so, made you the
fiercest woman in the galaxy.

764
01:07:44,821 --> 01:07:48,438
It's why I trusted you
to find the Soul Stone.

765
01:07:51,001 --> 01:07:54,461
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

766
01:07:54,946 --> 01:07:56,946
I am disappointed.

767
01:07:57,146 --> 01:07:59,993
But not because
you didn't find it.

768
01:08:03,810 --> 01:08:06,349
But because you did.

769
01:08:06,921 --> 01:08:09,145
And you lied.

770
01:08:25,798 --> 01:08:27,501
Nebula!

771
01:08:34,062 --> 01:08:35,578
Don't do this.

772
01:08:35,706 --> 01:08:40,010
Sometime ago, your sister snuck
aboard this ship to kill me.

773
01:08:40,035 --> 01:08:43,440
- Please, don't do this.
- She very nearly succeeded.

774
01:08:43,938 --> 01:08:48,625
So, I brought her here...
to talk.

775
01:08:55,503 --> 01:08:58,643
Stop. Stop it.

776
01:09:03,924 --> 01:09:06,525
I swear to you, on my life...

777
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:10,452
I never found the Soul Stone.

778
01:09:13,253 --> 01:09:14,784
Accessing memory files.

779
01:09:14,809 --> 01:09:16,652
You know what he's about to do.

780
01:09:16,668 --> 01:09:19,730
He's finally ready, and he's going
for the stones. All of them.

781
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:23,840
He'll never get them all.
He can't, Nebula.

782
01:09:23,865 --> 01:09:27,958
Because I found the map to the Soul
Stone, and I burned it to ash.

783
01:09:27,991 --> 01:09:30,639
I burned it.

784
01:09:34,108 --> 01:09:36,928
You're strong.

785
01:09:37,748 --> 01:09:39,787
Me...

786
01:09:41,639 --> 01:09:45,443
The generous... me...

787
01:09:47,462 --> 01:09:50,118
But I never taught you to lie.

788
01:09:50,134 --> 01:09:53,055
That's why you're so bad at it.

789
01:09:54,837 --> 01:09:59,243
Where is the Soul Stone?

790
01:10:16,657 --> 01:10:18,578
Vormir.

791
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:38,043
The stone is on Vormir.

792
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:43,574
Show me.

793
01:10:45,059 --> 01:10:46,285
I am Groot.

794
01:10:46,485 --> 01:10:48,703
Tinkle in the cup.
We're not looking for...

795
01:10:48,903 --> 01:10:51,410
What's a twig?
Everybody's seen a twig.

796
01:10:51,414 --> 01:10:52,671
I am Groot!

797
01:10:52,771 --> 01:10:54,438
You can pour what's
in the cup out in space

798
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:55,695
then go in the cup again.

799
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:56,855
You speak Groot?

800
01:10:57,055 --> 01:10:58,993
Yes, the tone on Asgard,
that was an elective.

801
01:10:59,009 --> 01:11:02,118
- I am Groot.
- You'll know when we're close.

802
01:11:02,122 --> 01:11:06,825
Nivadellir's forge harnesses the
blazing power of the Neutron star.

803
01:11:09,253 --> 01:11:10,955
It's the birthplace of my hammer.

804
01:11:11,907 --> 01:11:13,317
It's truly awesome.

805
01:11:19,614 --> 01:11:22,958
Okay. Time to be the captain.

806
01:11:27,863 --> 01:11:31,831
So dead brother, huh? Yeah,
that could be annoying.

807
01:11:32,254 --> 01:11:35,356
Well, he's been dead before.

808
01:11:35,395 --> 01:11:38,715
Now this time, I think
it really might be true.

809
01:11:38,723 --> 01:11:42,621
- And you said your sister and your dad...
- Both dead.

810
01:11:42,952 --> 01:11:46,616
- But still got a mom, though?
- Killed by a Dark Elf.

811
01:11:46,663 --> 01:11:50,342
- A best friend?
- Stabbed through the heart.

812
01:11:52,512 --> 01:11:56,152
You sure you're up to
this particular mission?

813
01:11:57,945 --> 01:11:59,305
Absolutely!

814
01:11:59,505 --> 01:12:02,265
The rage and vengeance, anger...

815
01:12:02,273 --> 01:12:05,172
Loss, regret, they're all
tremendous motivators.

816
01:12:05,184 --> 01:12:07,976
They really clear the
mind, so I'm good to go.

817
01:12:08,164 --> 01:12:11,094
Yeah, but this Thanos
we're talking about,

818
01:12:11,294 --> 01:12:13,117
he's the toughest there is.

819
01:12:13,142 --> 01:12:15,337
- Well, he's never fought me.
- Yeah, he has.

820
01:12:15,362 --> 01:12:17,009
He's never fought me twice.

821
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:19,908
I'm getting a new
hammer, don't forget.

822
01:12:19,933 --> 01:12:22,683
It better be some hammer.

823
01:12:26,086 --> 01:12:29,171
You know, I'm 1,500 years old.

824
01:12:29,195 --> 01:12:31,309
I've killed twice as many
enemies as that, and

825
01:12:31,321 --> 01:12:33,312
every one of them
would've rather killed me

826
01:12:33,337 --> 01:12:34,962
but none succeeded.

827
01:12:34,987 --> 01:12:37,955
I'm only alive because
fate wants me alive.

828
01:12:37,976 --> 01:12:41,149
Thanos is just the, latest
in a long line of bastards

829
01:12:41,174 --> 01:12:45,358
and he will be the latest to feel
my vengeance. Fate wills it so.

830
01:12:46,352 --> 01:12:49,195
And what if you're wrong?

831
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:54,132
Well, if I'm wrong, then...

832
01:12:54,514 --> 01:12:57,952
What more could I lose?

833
01:13:09,350 --> 01:13:13,810
I could lose a lot. Me
personally, I could lose a lot.

834
01:13:17,445 --> 01:13:19,007
Okay.

835
01:13:19,929 --> 01:13:23,732
Well, if fate does want you
to kill that crapsack,

836
01:13:23,757 --> 01:13:26,296
- you need more than one stupid eyeball.
- What's this?

837
01:13:26,321 --> 01:13:27,457
What's it look like?

838
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:30,735
Some jerk lost a bet
with me in Contraxia.

839
01:13:30,743 --> 01:13:33,164
- He gave you his eye?
- No, he gave me 100 credits.

840
01:13:33,188 --> 01:13:36,711
I snuck into his room later
that night and stole his eye.

841
01:13:37,977 --> 01:13:40,805
Thank you, sweet rabbit.

842
01:13:47,439 --> 01:13:49,877
I would've washed that.

843
01:13:49,902 --> 01:13:52,923
The only way I could sneak it
off Contraxia was on my...

844
01:13:53,435 --> 01:13:55,128
Hey, we're here.

845
01:13:59,321 --> 01:14:02,813
I don't think this thing works.
Everything seems dark.

846
01:14:03,950 --> 01:14:06,520
But it ain't the eye.

847
01:14:19,075 --> 01:14:23,856
Something's wrong.
The star's gone out.

848
01:14:23,887 --> 01:14:27,410
And the rings are frozen.

849
01:14:46,346 --> 01:14:50,673
I hope these dwarfs are better at
forging than they are at cleaning.

850
01:14:54,883 --> 01:14:58,374
Maybe they realized they live in a
junk pile in the middle of space.

851
01:14:58,390 --> 01:15:01,812
The forge hasn't gone
dark in centuries.

852
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:07,679
- You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?
- Yes. Why?

853
01:15:07,695 --> 01:15:10,726
Did it look anything like that?

854
01:15:13,015 --> 01:15:17,327
- I am Groot.
- Get back to the pod.

855
01:15:20,764 --> 01:15:23,912
Eitri, wait! Stop!

856
01:15:26,471 --> 01:15:27,963
Thor?

857
01:15:30,263 --> 01:15:35,247
- What happened here?
- You were supposed to protect us.

858
01:15:35,450 --> 01:15:41,342
- Asgard was supposed to protect us.
- Asgard is destroyed.

859
01:15:42,870 --> 01:15:46,745
Eitri, what did you do?

860
01:15:59,351 --> 01:16:03,296
300 dwarfs lived on this ring.

861
01:16:03,475 --> 01:16:07,069
I thought if I did what
he asked, they'd be safe.

862
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:11,920
I made what he wanted.

863
01:16:12,257 --> 01:16:17,311
A device capable of harnessing
the power of the stones.

864
01:16:21,255 --> 01:16:24,184
And he killed everyone anyway.

865
01:16:25,966 --> 01:16:28,497
All except me.

866
01:16:28,621 --> 01:16:31,902
"Your life is yours," he said.

867
01:16:31,927 --> 01:16:36,661
"But your hands. Your
hands are mine alone."

868
01:16:36,739 --> 01:16:39,450
Eitri, this isn't
about your hands.

869
01:16:39,770 --> 01:16:41,669
Every weapon you've
ever designed,

870
01:16:41,694 --> 01:16:45,849
every axe, hammer, sword,
it's all inside your head.

871
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:49,989
Now I know it feels like all hope is lost.
Trust me, I know.

872
01:16:50,278 --> 01:16:56,177
But together, you and
I, we can kill Thanos.

873
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:38,035
Mantis, listen very carefully.

874
01:17:38,044 --> 01:17:40,825
I need you to meet me on Titan.

875
01:17:46,876 --> 01:17:49,399
- What's going on?
- I think we're here.

876
01:17:49,424 --> 01:17:52,400
I don't think this rig has
a self-park function.

877
01:17:53,267 --> 01:17:55,915
Get your hand inside this.

878
01:17:57,696 --> 01:18:01,961
Then, we got one big dodge, so we
gotta move at the same time.

879
01:18:06,728 --> 01:18:10,735
We might wanna turn, turn, turn.
Turn!

880
01:18:38,711 --> 01:18:40,734
You all right?

881
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:44,523
That was close.

882
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:46,562
I owe you one.

883
01:18:46,594 --> 01:18:50,906
Let me just say, if aliens wind up
implanting eggs in my chest or something,

884
01:18:50,944 --> 01:18:53,609
- and I eat one of you, I'm sorry.
- I don't want another single,

885
01:18:53,634 --> 01:18:55,914
pop-culture reference outta you for
the rest of the trip. Understand?

886
01:18:55,938 --> 01:18:58,336
I'm trying to say that,
something is coming.

887
01:19:04,614 --> 01:19:06,442
Thanos!

888
01:19:26,517 --> 01:19:29,329
Oh, my God! Please don't
put your eggs in me!

889
01:19:37,712 --> 01:19:40,821
Die, Blanket of Death!

890
01:19:45,696 --> 01:19:49,336
Everybody stay where you
are, chill the F out...

891
01:19:49,954 --> 01:19:52,633
I'm gonna ask you
this one time...

892
01:19:52,658 --> 01:19:54,014
Where is Gamora?

893
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:56,773
Yeah, I'll do you one better.
Who's Gamora?

894
01:19:56,798 --> 01:20:00,015
I'll do you one better!
Why is Gamora?

895
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:03,038
Let him go, or I swear to you, I'm
gonna french fry this little freak.

896
01:20:03,063 --> 01:20:06,705
Let's do it. You shoot my guy and
I'll blast him. Let's go!

897
01:20:06,804 --> 01:20:10,395
- Do it, Quill. I can take it.
- No, he can't take it.

898
01:20:10,420 --> 01:20:11,379
She's right. You can't.

899
01:20:11,479 --> 01:20:13,233
Oh yeah? You don't wanna
tell me where she is?

900
01:20:13,257 --> 01:20:17,171
That's fine. I'll kill all three of you
and I'll beat it out of Thanos myself!

901
01:20:17,196 --> 01:20:19,530
- Starting with you.
- Wait what, Thanos? All right...

902
01:20:19,546 --> 01:20:21,772
Let me ask you this one time...

903
01:20:21,797 --> 01:20:23,898
What master do you serve?

904
01:20:23,922 --> 01:20:27,322
What master do I serve? Am
I supposed to say Jesus?

905
01:20:27,399 --> 01:20:29,588
- You're from Earth.
- Not from Earth. I'm from Missouri.

906
01:20:29,612 --> 01:20:32,197
Yeah, that's on Earth, dipshit.
What are you hassling us for?

907
01:20:32,222 --> 01:20:36,791
- So you're not with Thanos?
- With Thanos?

908
01:20:36,915 --> 01:20:39,664
No! I'm here to kill Thanos.

909
01:20:39,696 --> 01:20:41,491
He took my girl. Wait, who are you?

910
01:20:42,083 --> 01:20:43,796
We're the Avengers, man.

911
01:20:43,996 --> 01:20:47,518
- You're the ones Thor told us about!
- You know Thor?

912
01:20:47,892 --> 01:20:51,610
Yeah. Tall guy, not
that good-looking.

913
01:20:51,774 --> 01:20:54,617
Where is he now?

914
01:21:08,257 --> 01:21:10,149
This the plan? We'll
hit him with a brick?

915
01:21:10,252 --> 01:21:11,968
It's a mold.

916
01:21:12,598 --> 01:21:16,919
A king's weapon. Meant to
be the greatest in Asgard.

917
01:21:17,513 --> 01:21:19,831
In theory, it could
even summon the Bifrost.

918
01:21:20,092 --> 01:21:21,771
Does it have a name?

919
01:21:23,056 --> 01:21:24,374
Storm breaker.

920
01:21:24,539 --> 01:21:27,587
Yeah. It's a bit much.

921
01:21:27,916 --> 01:21:30,236
So how do we make it?

922
01:21:30,997 --> 01:21:32,830
You'll have to restart the forge.

923
01:21:34,288 --> 01:21:37,567
Awaken the heart of the dying star.

924
01:21:38,908 --> 01:21:42,868
Rabbit, fire up the pod.

925
01:21:44,673 --> 01:21:47,212
What the hell happened
to this planet?

926
01:21:47,237 --> 01:21:48,998
It's 8 degrees off its axis.

927
01:21:49,089 --> 01:21:52,002
Gravitational pull is
all over the place.

928
01:21:52,673 --> 01:21:56,360
Yeah, we got one advantage.
He's coming to us.

929
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:59,383
We'll use it. Alright,
I have a plan.

930
01:22:00,631 --> 01:22:03,271
It's pretty simple. We draw him in,
pin him down, get what we need.

931
01:22:03,478 --> 01:22:06,977
We definitely don't want to dance with
this guy, we just want the gauntlet.

932
01:22:07,002 --> 01:22:08,348
Are you yawning?

933
01:22:09,453 --> 01:22:11,633
In the middle of this,
while I'm breaking it down?

934
01:22:11,658 --> 01:22:13,369
Did you hear what I said?

935
01:22:13,455 --> 01:22:16,080
I stopped listening after you
said that we need a plan.

936
01:22:16,088 --> 01:22:17,113
Okay, Mr. Clean's
on his own page.

937
01:22:17,204 --> 01:22:19,611
See, not winging it isn't
really what they do.

938
01:22:19,636 --> 01:22:21,807
What exactly is it that they do?

939
01:22:21,832 --> 01:22:25,003
Kick names, take ass.

940
01:22:31,361 --> 01:22:32,926
All right, just get over here, please?

941
01:22:33,475 --> 01:22:35,792
Mr. Lord,
can you get your folks to circle up?

942
01:22:35,817 --> 01:22:39,004
Star-Lord is fine.

943
01:22:40,162 --> 01:22:41,339
We've gotta coalesce.

944
01:22:41,539 --> 01:22:43,412
Because if all we come at him
with is a plucky attitude...

945
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:47,435
Dude, don't call us plucky.
We don't know what it means.

946
01:22:47,451 --> 01:22:51,310
All right, we're optimistic, yes.
I like your plan, except it sucks.

947
01:22:51,335 --> 01:22:54,749
So let me do the plan, and that
way, it might be really good.

948
01:22:54,774 --> 01:22:56,804
Tell him about the dance-off
to save the Universe.

949
01:22:56,816 --> 01:22:57,873
What dance-off?

950
01:22:57,973 --> 01:23:00,618
- It's not a, it's not a...
- Like in Footloose? The movie?

951
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:04,321
Exactly like Footloose! Is it still
the greatest movie in history?

952
01:23:04,346 --> 01:23:06,064
It never was.

953
01:23:06,713 --> 01:23:09,494
- We're getting no help with Flash Gordon.
- Flash Gordon?

954
01:23:09,519 --> 01:23:12,128
By the way? That's a compliment.
Don't forget.

955
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:15,260
I'm half-human. So that's
50% of me that's stupid,

956
01:23:15,462 --> 01:23:18,415
- And that's 100% you.
- Your math is blowing my mind.

957
01:23:18,456 --> 01:23:19,868
Excuse me?

958
01:23:20,525 --> 01:23:24,712
But does your friend
often do that?

959
01:23:25,181 --> 01:23:28,196
Strange! You all right?

960
01:23:37,731 --> 01:23:41,301
- You're back. You're all right.
- Hey, what was that?

961
01:23:41,326 --> 01:23:45,482
I went forward in time, to
view alternate futures...

962
01:23:45,787 --> 01:23:49,662
To see all the possible
outcomes of the coming conflict.

963
01:23:49,896 --> 01:23:53,771
- How many did you see?
- 14,000,605.

964
01:23:55,217 --> 01:23:58,037
How many did we win?

965
01:24:01,645 --> 01:24:03,137
One.

966
01:24:24,686 --> 01:24:27,944
The Stone had
better be up there.

967
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:33,030
For your sister's sake.

968
01:24:52,406 --> 01:24:57,812
Welcome, Thanos, son of Eros.

969
01:24:59,164 --> 01:25:02,601
Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

970
01:25:02,725 --> 01:25:04,076
You know us?

971
01:25:04,108 --> 01:25:08,912
It is my curse to know
all who journey here.

972
01:25:08,999 --> 01:25:11,420
Where is the Soul Stone?

973
01:25:11,445 --> 01:25:13,554
You should know,

974
01:25:13,754 --> 01:25:17,226
it extracts a terrible price.

975
01:25:18,116 --> 01:25:20,686
I'm prepared.

976
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:26,061
We all think that at first.

977
01:25:29,163 --> 01:25:32,178
We are all wrong.

978
01:25:42,949 --> 01:25:45,691
How is it you know
this place so well?

979
01:25:45,716 --> 01:25:50,309
A lifetime ago, I, too,
sought the stones.

980
01:25:50,341 --> 01:25:55,380
I even held one in my hand.
But it cast me out.

981
01:25:55,435 --> 01:25:57,653
Banished me here.

982
01:25:57,661 --> 01:26:01,911
Guiding others to a
treasure I cannot possess.

983
01:26:10,057 --> 01:26:13,689
What you seek lies
in front of you.

984
01:26:13,846 --> 01:26:17,048
As does what you fear.

985
01:26:17,174 --> 01:26:20,525
- What's this?
- The price.

986
01:26:20,611 --> 01:26:25,517
Soul holds a special place
among the Infinity Stones.

987
01:26:26,178 --> 01:26:30,814
You might say it is,
a certain wisdom.

988
01:26:31,849 --> 01:26:33,589
Tell me what it needs.

989
01:26:34,098 --> 01:26:37,357
To ensure
whoever possesses it,

990
01:26:37,404 --> 01:26:40,865
understands its power...

991
01:26:40,904 --> 01:26:44,795
The Stone demands a sacrifice.

992
01:26:44,879 --> 01:26:46,419
Of what?

993
01:26:46,619 --> 01:26:48,738
In order to take the Stone...

994
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:52,105
You must lose that
which you love.

995
01:26:54,199 --> 01:26:58,738
A soul, for a soul.

996
01:27:13,202 --> 01:27:16,381
All my life, I
dreamed of a day...

997
01:27:16,436 --> 01:27:18,944
a moment...

998
01:27:19,181 --> 01:27:22,033
when you got
what you deserved.

999
01:27:23,204 --> 01:27:26,743
And I was always
so disappointed.

1000
01:27:29,149 --> 01:27:31,281
But, now...

1001
01:27:34,516 --> 01:27:37,961
You kill, and torture,

1002
01:27:39,563 --> 01:27:42,726
and you call it mercy.

1003
01:27:45,508 --> 01:27:48,539
The Universe has judged you.

1004
01:27:49,475 --> 01:27:52,571
You asked it for a prize and

1005
01:27:52,771 --> 01:27:54,982
and it told you, no.

1006
01:27:55,553 --> 01:27:57,810
You failed.

1007
01:27:58,366 --> 01:28:00,975
And do you wanna know why?

1008
01:28:01,209 --> 01:28:03,189
Because you love nothing.

1009
01:28:03,825 --> 01:28:05,250
No one.

1010
01:28:16,422 --> 01:28:20,562
Really? Tears?

1011
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:23,109
They are not for him.

1012
01:28:36,816 --> 01:28:38,894
No.

1013
01:28:39,401 --> 01:28:42,041
This isn't love.

1014
01:28:42,066 --> 01:28:45,550
I ignored my destiny once.

1015
01:28:46,808 --> 01:28:49,082
I cannot do that again.

1016
01:28:49,737 --> 01:28:51,426
Even...

1017
01:28:51,686 --> 01:28:53,684
for you.

1018
01:29:17,146 --> 01:29:19,997
I'm sorry, little one.

1019
01:31:01,373 --> 01:31:04,748
Drop to 2,600. Heading 030.

1020
01:31:04,818 --> 01:31:06,573
I hope you're right about this,

1021
01:31:06,595 --> 01:31:09,662
or we're gonna land a lot
faster than you want to.

1022
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:27,702
When you sad we were going
to open Wakanda to the

1023
01:31:27,714 --> 01:31:30,282
rest of the world, this
is not what I imagined.

1024
01:31:30,290 --> 01:31:32,266
What did you imagine?

1025
01:31:32,291 --> 01:31:36,047
The Olympics. Even a Starbucks.

1026
01:31:49,594 --> 01:31:52,922
- Should we bow?
- Yeah, he's a king.

1027
01:31:52,953 --> 01:31:56,078
Seems like I'm always
thanking you for something.

1028
01:31:56,757 --> 01:32:00,632
- What are you doing?
- We don't do that here.

1029
01:32:00,657 --> 01:32:03,229
So how big of an assault
should we expect?

1030
01:32:03,241 --> 01:32:05,883
Sir, I think you should expect
quite a big assault.

1031
01:32:05,899 --> 01:32:08,664
- How are we looking?
- You will have my Kingsguard.

1032
01:32:08,704 --> 01:32:12,578
The Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje.
And...

1033
01:32:12,938 --> 01:32:16,547
A semi-stable 100-year old man.

1034
01:32:18,665 --> 01:32:20,344
How have you been, Buck?

1035
01:32:20,369 --> 01:32:23,833
Not bad, for the
end of the world.

1036
01:32:36,410 --> 01:32:38,980
The structure is polymorphic.

1037
01:32:39,019 --> 01:32:42,183
Right. We had to attach each
neuron non-sequentially.

1038
01:32:42,199 --> 01:32:47,269
Why didn't you just reprogram the
synapses to work collectively?

1039
01:32:47,378 --> 01:32:51,073
Because... we didn't think of it?

1040
01:32:51,089 --> 01:32:54,456
- I'm sure you did your best.
- Can you do it?

1041
01:32:54,635 --> 01:32:58,017
Yes, but there are more than
2 trillion neurons here.

1042
01:32:58,057 --> 01:33:01,681
One misalignment could cause a
cascade of circuit failures.

1043
01:33:01,752 --> 01:33:05,353
- It will take time, brother.
- How long?

1044
01:33:05,378 --> 01:33:08,424
As long as you can give me.

1045
01:33:11,464 --> 01:33:15,846
Something's entered
the atmosphere.

1046
01:33:30,388 --> 01:33:32,950
Hey Cap, we got a
situation here.

1047
01:33:42,123 --> 01:33:44,568
God, I love this place.

1048
01:33:44,584 --> 01:33:49,239
Don't start celebrating yet, guys. We
got more incoming outside the dome.

1049
01:34:07,233 --> 01:34:10,938
It's too late. We need to
destroy the Stone now.

1050
01:34:10,963 --> 01:34:14,563
- Vision, get your ass back on the table.
- We will hold them off.

1051
01:34:14,565 --> 01:34:19,314
Wanda, as soon as that stone's out
of his head, you blow it to hell.

1052
01:34:19,339 --> 01:34:20,408
I will.

1053
01:34:20,455 --> 01:34:24,009
Evacuate the city,
engage all defenses...

1054
01:34:24,026 --> 01:34:27,517
and get this man a shield!

1055
01:34:35,905 --> 01:34:38,539
I don't think you get
the scientifics here.

1056
01:34:38,564 --> 01:34:41,354
These rings are gigantic.
You wanna get them moving,

1057
01:34:41,366 --> 01:34:43,798
you need something bigger
to yank them loose!

1058
01:34:43,814 --> 01:34:45,931
- Leave that to me.
- Leave it to you?

1059
01:34:45,939 --> 01:34:49,993
Buddy, you're in space. All
you got is a wrong plan...

1060
01:34:57,423 --> 01:34:59,992
Fire the engines!

1061
01:35:15,949 --> 01:35:19,425
More power, rabbit!

1062
01:35:50,112 --> 01:35:52,572
Well done, boy.

1063
01:35:53,206 --> 01:35:56,995
That's Nidavellir!

1064
01:36:15,772 --> 01:36:18,818
- Damn it.
- What's damn it?

1065
01:36:18,843 --> 01:36:20,905
- The mechanism is crippled.
- What?

1066
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:23,142
With the iris closed, I
can't heat the metal.

1067
01:36:23,167 --> 01:36:27,182
- How long will it take to heat it?
- A few minutes, maybe more. Why?

1068
01:36:29,095 --> 01:36:31,759
- I'm gonna hold it open.
- That's suicide.

1069
01:36:31,784 --> 01:36:34,901
So is facing Thanos
without that axe.

1070
01:36:43,661 --> 01:36:47,676
- How are we looking, Bruce?
- Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it.

1071
01:36:50,073 --> 01:36:54,979
It's so amazing! It's like being
the Hulk without actually...

1072
01:36:57,802 --> 01:36:59,583
I'm okay.

1073
01:37:01,309 --> 01:37:05,043
I got two heat signatures
breaking through the treeline.

1074
01:37:31,976 --> 01:37:34,452
Thank you for standing with us.

1075
01:37:34,484 --> 01:37:36,468
Of course, brother.

1076
01:37:56,159 --> 01:37:58,596
Where's the other friend?

1077
01:37:58,620 --> 01:38:01,479
He will pay for his
life with yours.

1078
01:38:01,893 --> 01:38:04,744
Thanos will have that stone.

1079
01:38:04,815 --> 01:38:06,282
That's not gonna happen.

1080
01:38:06,307 --> 01:38:08,838
You are in Wakanda now.

1081
01:38:08,878 --> 01:38:13,377
Thanos will have nothing
but dust, and blood.

1082
01:38:13,503 --> 01:38:15,177
We,

1083
01:38:15,377 --> 01:38:18,127
have blood to spare.

1084
01:38:28,877 --> 01:38:33,103
- They surrender?
- Not exactly.

1085
01:38:43,124 --> 01:38:45,959
- Yibambe!
- Yibambe!

1086
01:38:46,085 --> 01:38:47,762
Yibambe!

1087
01:38:59,105 --> 01:39:01,893
What the hell?

1088
01:39:03,611 --> 01:39:06,345
Looks like we pissed her off.

1089
01:39:16,276 --> 01:39:18,924
They're killing themselves.

1090
01:39:54,104 --> 01:39:55,617
See the teeth on those things?

1091
01:39:55,629 --> 01:39:58,346
Alright, back up, Sam. They
ain't get your wings yet.

1092
01:40:10,201 --> 01:40:12,757
Cap, if these things circle the
perimeter and get in behind us,

1093
01:40:12,926 --> 01:40:14,677
there's nothing between
them and Vision.

1094
01:40:14,877 --> 01:40:16,803
Then we better keep
them in front of us.

1095
01:40:16,828 --> 01:40:19,224
How do we do that?

1096
01:40:20,472 --> 01:40:22,660
We open the barrier.

1097
01:40:24,272 --> 01:40:28,718
On my signal, open
northwest section 17.

1098
01:40:28,766 --> 01:40:31,045
<i>Requesting confirmation, my King.</i>

1099
01:40:31,055 --> 01:40:32,937
<i>You said open the barrier?</i>

1100
01:40:32,946 --> 01:40:36,578
- On my signal.
- This will be the end of Wakanda.

1101
01:40:37,172 --> 01:40:41,554
Then it will be the noblest
ending in history.

1102
01:40:53,672 --> 01:40:57,609
- Wakanda forever!
- Wakanda forever!

1103
01:41:07,859 --> 01:41:08,902
Now!

1104
01:41:39,192 --> 01:41:42,165
- How much longer, Shuri?
- We've barely begun, brother.

1105
01:41:42,323 --> 01:41:44,915
You might want to
pick up the pace.

1106
01:41:51,183 --> 01:41:53,300
All fathers, give me strength.

1107
01:41:53,325 --> 01:41:54,702
You understand, boy?

1108
01:41:55,017 --> 01:41:58,450
You're about to take the
full force of a star.

1109
01:41:59,106 --> 01:42:01,106
It'll kill you.

1110
01:42:01,325 --> 01:42:03,817
And if I die?

1111
01:42:03,856 --> 01:42:08,895
Yes, that's what,
killing you means.

1112
01:42:35,806 --> 01:42:38,595
Hold it, hold it, Thor!

1113
01:43:27,988 --> 01:43:31,081
Thor? Say something, come on.

1114
01:43:31,340 --> 01:43:34,034
Thor, you okay?

1115
01:43:37,550 --> 01:43:41,885
- I think he's dying.
- He needs the axe.

1116
01:43:42,619 --> 01:43:45,337
Where's the handle?

1117
01:43:46,939 --> 01:43:50,611
Tree! Help me find the handle.

1118
01:44:58,254 --> 01:45:00,238
There's too many of them!

1119
01:45:27,740 --> 01:45:30,436
You guys are so screwed now!

1120
01:45:33,678 --> 01:45:36,904
Bring me Thanos!

1121
01:46:08,381 --> 01:46:10,217
Oh, yeah.

1122
01:46:12,836 --> 01:46:16,149
You're much more of a Thanos.

1123
01:46:17,281 --> 01:46:20,289
I take it that Maw is dead?

1124
01:46:21,390 --> 01:46:24,764
This day extracts a heavy toll.

1125
01:46:25,906 --> 01:46:28,585
Still, he accomplished
his mission.

1126
01:46:28,593 --> 01:46:30,131
You may regret that.

1127
01:46:30,331 --> 01:46:34,382
He brought you face-to-face with
a Master of the Mystic Arts.

1128
01:46:36,905 --> 01:46:40,038
Where do you think
he brought you?

1129
01:46:40,082 --> 01:46:44,292
Let me guess.
Your home?

1130
01:46:47,567 --> 01:46:49,466
It was.

1131
01:46:51,466 --> 01:46:54,466
And it was beautiful.

1132
01:46:55,458 --> 01:46:57,657
Titan was like most planets.

1133
01:46:57,857 --> 01:47:00,966
Too many mouths,
not enough to go around.

1134
01:47:00,989 --> 01:47:05,106
And when we faced extinction,
I offered a solution.

1135
01:47:05,192 --> 01:47:07,356
Genocide?

1136
01:47:07,381 --> 01:47:11,701
At random. Dispassionate, fair.
The rich and poor alike.

1137
01:47:12,357 --> 01:47:15,177
And they called me a madman.

1138
01:47:15,319 --> 01:47:19,521
And what I predicted,
came to pass.

1139
01:47:20,507 --> 01:47:22,852
Congratulations. You're a prophet.

1140
01:47:23,195 --> 01:47:24,585
I'm a survivor.

1141
01:47:24,601 --> 01:47:27,030
Who wants to murder trillions.

1142
01:47:27,109 --> 01:47:31,116
With all six Stones, I could
simply snap my fingers.

1143
01:47:31,179 --> 01:47:36,314
They would all cease to exist.
I call that mercy.

1144
01:47:37,666 --> 01:47:40,455
And then what?

1145
01:47:40,744 --> 01:47:42,492
I finally rest.

1146
01:47:42,692 --> 01:47:46,572
And watch the sun rise
on a grateful universe.

1147
01:47:47,221 --> 01:47:51,439
The hardest choices require
the strongest wills.

1148
01:47:51,729 --> 01:47:57,588
I think you'll find our
will equal to yours.

1149
01:47:57,908 --> 01:47:59,837
"Our"?

1150
01:48:04,780 --> 01:48:09,483
- Piece of cake, Quill.
- Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off!

1151
01:48:46,829 --> 01:48:48,758
Boom!

1152
01:48:49,227 --> 01:48:51,727
Don't let him close his fist.

1153
01:48:55,313 --> 01:48:58,578
Magic! More magic!

1154
01:48:58,813 --> 01:48:59,948
Magic with a kick!

1155
01:49:00,270 --> 01:49:02,301
Magic with a...

1156
01:49:02,542 --> 01:49:04,323
Insect.

1157
01:49:41,471 --> 01:49:43,899
- Well, well.
- You should have killed me.

1158
01:49:44,061 --> 01:49:47,209
Would have been a
waste of parts!

1159
01:49:51,140 --> 01:49:53,687
Where's Gamora?

1160
01:50:33,340 --> 01:50:34,800
Is he under? Don't let up.

1161
01:50:34,825 --> 01:50:37,637
Be quick. He is very strong.

1162
01:50:37,653 --> 01:50:41,562
Parker, help. Get over here. She
can't hold him much longer. Let's go.

1163
01:50:48,811 --> 01:50:51,531
I thought you'd be harder to catch.
For the record, this was my plan.

1164
01:50:52,449 --> 01:50:54,230
Not so strong now, huh?

1165
01:50:54,668 --> 01:50:57,167
Where's Gamora?

1166
01:50:57,362 --> 01:51:00,885
- My Gamora!
- Oh, bullshit!

1167
01:51:00,917 --> 01:51:03,307
Where is she?

1168
01:51:03,354 --> 01:51:06,580
- He is in anguish.
- Good.

1169
01:51:07,486 --> 01:51:08,486
He...

1170
01:51:08,511 --> 01:51:10,234
He mourns.

1171
01:51:10,258 --> 01:51:14,633
What does this monster
have to mourn?

1172
01:51:14,906 --> 01:51:16,867
Gamora...

1173
01:51:19,453 --> 01:51:20,921
What?

1174
01:51:20,945 --> 01:51:27,874
He took her to Vormir. He came back
with the Soul Stone. She didn't.

1175
01:51:28,990 --> 01:51:32,997
Okay, Quill? You gotta cool
it right now, you understand?

1176
01:51:33,466 --> 01:51:36,856
Don't. Don't engage.
We almost got this off!

1177
01:51:37,989 --> 01:51:41,270
Tell me she's lying.

1178
01:51:41,434 --> 01:51:44,864
Asshole! Tell me
you didn't do it.

1179
01:51:45,918 --> 01:51:49,597
I had to...

1180
01:51:49,799 --> 01:51:52,800
No you didn't.

1181
01:51:55,753 --> 01:51:59,214
- No! No, you didn't!
- Quill!

1182
01:51:59,363 --> 01:52:00,876
Just stop! Stop!

1183
01:52:01,076 --> 01:52:04,441
It's coming, I got it, I got it!

1184
01:52:07,259 --> 01:52:09,337
Oh, God.

1185
01:53:07,423 --> 01:53:10,954
Come and get some, face-dogs!

1186
01:53:13,048 --> 01:53:15,985
Come on! Get some, get some!

1187
01:53:18,235 --> 01:53:21,008
- How much for the gun?
- Not for sale.

1188
01:53:21,055 --> 01:53:23,758
Okay, how much for the arm?

1189
01:53:24,649 --> 01:53:27,211
Oh, I'll get that arm.

1190
01:53:35,522 --> 01:53:39,115
- New haircut?
- I notice you've copied my beard.

1191
01:53:40,834 --> 01:53:43,279
Oh, by the way, this is a
friend of mine. A tree.

1192
01:53:43,304 --> 01:53:45,858
I am Groot!

1193
01:53:46,468 --> 01:53:48,858
I am Steve Rogers.

1194
01:54:08,042 --> 01:54:11,033
Fall back! Fall back now!

1195
01:54:19,398 --> 01:54:21,983
Focus all fire on the
left flank, Sam.

1196
01:54:22,008 --> 01:54:24,124
I'm doing it.

1197
01:54:46,793 --> 01:54:49,058
Why was she up there
all this time?

1198
01:54:49,113 --> 01:54:52,574
She's on the field. Take it.

1199
01:55:23,381 --> 01:55:26,818
Guys, we got a Vision
situation here.

1200
01:55:28,717 --> 01:55:31,834
- Somebody get to Vision!
- I got him.

1201
01:55:31,859 --> 01:55:33,366
On my way.

1202
01:55:38,115 --> 01:55:41,052
He'll die alone. As will you.

1203
01:55:41,060 --> 01:55:43,021
She's not alone.

1204
01:56:08,412 --> 01:56:10,419
Oh, no. Oh, no, you don't.

1205
01:56:10,444 --> 01:56:12,591
This isn't gonna be like
New York, pal. This

1206
01:56:12,603 --> 01:56:14,858
suit's already kicked the
crap outta the Hulk.

1207
01:56:19,282 --> 01:56:22,610
Guys. Vision needs back-up now.

1208
01:56:23,820 --> 01:56:27,546
Hulk? I know you're not making your
entrance 'till the last second.

1209
01:56:27,554 --> 01:56:31,585
This is it, man. This is
the last, last second.

1210
01:56:34,741 --> 01:56:38,491
Hulk! Hulk!
Shit, Hulk!

1211
01:56:39,085 --> 01:56:44,819
- No!
- Screw you, you big, green asshole!

1212
01:56:44,827 --> 01:56:48,389
I'll do it myself. Come on.

1213
01:57:01,064 --> 01:57:03,235
See ya!

1214
01:57:13,863 --> 01:57:16,761
Hulk, we got a lot
to figure out, pal.

1215
01:57:27,451 --> 01:57:29,771
I thought you were a formidable machine.

1216
01:57:30,631 --> 01:57:33,281
But you're dying, like any man.

1217
01:57:41,563 --> 01:57:43,648
Get outta here!

1218
01:57:46,360 --> 01:57:48,289
Go!

1219
01:58:05,844 --> 01:58:08,023
That's really gross.

1220
01:58:34,611 --> 01:58:37,353
I thought I told you to go.

1221
01:58:37,431 --> 01:58:40,126
We don't trade lives, Captain.

1222
01:58:50,270 --> 01:58:52,973
I got you, I got you!

1223
01:58:53,004 --> 01:58:55,754
Sorry I can't remember
any of your names.

1224
01:59:40,179 --> 01:59:43,030
You're full of tricks, wizard.

1225
01:59:43,523 --> 01:59:48,312
But you never once used
your greatest weapon.

1226
01:59:49,822 --> 01:59:52,017
A fake.

1227
01:59:58,971 --> 02:00:02,760
You throw another moon at
me, and I'm gonna lose it.

1228
02:00:02,830 --> 02:00:05,252
- Stark.
- You know me?

1229
02:00:05,728 --> 02:00:10,556
I do. You're not the only
one cursed with knowledge.

1230
02:00:11,306 --> 02:00:13,454
My only curse is you.

1231
02:00:43,910 --> 02:00:47,300
All that for a drop of blood.

1232
02:01:29,965 --> 02:01:32,534
You have my respect, Stark.

1233
02:01:33,496 --> 02:01:37,550
When I'm done, half of
humanity will still be alive.

1234
02:01:42,245 --> 02:01:45,393
I hope they remember you.

1235
02:01:54,395 --> 02:01:56,387
Stop.

1236
02:02:01,778 --> 02:02:06,738
Spare his life, and I
will give you the Stone.

1237
02:02:09,337 --> 02:02:11,852
No tricks.

1238
02:02:15,610 --> 02:02:17,672
Don't!

1239
02:03:08,133 --> 02:03:10,398
One to go.

1240
02:03:19,624 --> 02:03:22,053
Where is he?

1241
02:03:29,901 --> 02:03:33,002
Did we just lose?

1242
02:03:35,339 --> 02:03:38,447
Why would you do that?

1243
02:03:40,424 --> 02:03:43,822
We're in the endgame now.

1244
02:04:08,572 --> 02:04:10,892
Are you okay?

1245
02:04:11,814 --> 02:04:15,032
What? What is it?

1246
02:04:16,087 --> 02:04:18,517
He's here.

1247
02:04:28,454 --> 02:04:33,196
Everyone on my position.
We have incoming.

1248
02:04:34,055 --> 02:04:37,086
What the hell?

1249
02:05:02,227 --> 02:05:05,516
Cap. That's him.

1250
02:05:07,015 --> 02:05:10,749
Eyes up. Stay sharp.

1251
02:05:34,407 --> 02:05:37,485
Wanda. It's time.

1252
02:05:37,524 --> 02:05:38,618
No.

1253
02:05:38,818 --> 02:05:40,930
They can't stop him,
Wanda. But we can.

1254
02:05:40,977 --> 02:05:44,212
Look at me. You have the
power to destroy the stone.

1255
02:05:44,237 --> 02:05:47,125
- Don't.
- You must. Please...

1256
02:05:48,292 --> 02:05:51,644
We are out of time.

1257
02:05:51,669 --> 02:05:56,278
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. You can.

1258
02:05:57,577 --> 02:06:01,608
If he gets this stone,
half the Universe dies.

1259
02:06:02,139 --> 02:06:03,525
It's not fair.

1260
02:06:04,979 --> 02:06:07,795
It shouldn't be you,
but it is.

1261
02:06:08,522 --> 02:06:10,044
It's all right.

1262
02:06:11,003 --> 02:06:13,717
You could never hurt me.

1263
02:06:22,153 --> 02:06:25,504
I just feel you.

1264
02:08:03,219 --> 02:08:05,429
I love you.

1265
02:08:34,188 --> 02:08:36,984
I understand, my child.

1266
02:08:37,665 --> 02:08:40,634
Better than anyone.

1267
02:08:40,931 --> 02:08:43,290
You could never.

1268
02:08:47,717 --> 02:08:51,599
Today, I lost more
than you can know.

1269
02:08:52,443 --> 02:08:56,028
But now is no time to mourn.

1270
02:08:57,295 --> 02:08:59,224
Now...

1271
02:08:59,295 --> 02:09:02,865
is no time at all.

1272
02:09:24,811 --> 02:09:27,576
No!

1273
02:10:23,671 --> 02:10:26,233
I told you...

1274
02:10:26,452 --> 02:10:30,178
You'd die for that.

1275
02:10:42,949 --> 02:10:45,340
You should have...

1276
02:10:47,003 --> 02:10:49,658
You...

1277
02:10:50,768 --> 02:10:54,869
You should have
gone for the head!

1278
02:10:56,254 --> 02:10:58,644
No!

1279
02:11:30,329 --> 02:11:32,766
Daughter?

1280
02:11:39,252 --> 02:11:41,494
Did you do it?

1281
02:11:42,586 --> 02:11:44,992
Yes.

1282
02:11:52,003 --> 02:11:54,901
What did it cost?

1283
02:11:57,095 --> 02:12:00,220
Everything.

1284
02:12:09,074 --> 02:12:11,042
What did you do?

1285
02:12:11,972 --> 02:12:14,596
What did you do?!

1286
02:12:27,050 --> 02:12:29,237
Where did he go?

1287
02:12:31,628 --> 02:12:33,675
Thor...

1288
02:12:35,738 --> 02:12:37,347
Where did he go?

1289
02:12:37,449 --> 02:12:39,706
Steve?

1290
02:13:13,415 --> 02:13:15,585
Up, General, up!

1291
02:13:16,378 --> 02:13:17,914
This is no place to die.

1292
02:13:32,856 --> 02:13:34,926
I am Groot...

1293
02:13:34,950 --> 02:13:36,207
No.

1294
02:13:37,020 --> 02:13:41,363
No. No. No. No! Groot...

1295
02:13:41,651 --> 02:13:43,619
No...

1296
02:13:56,099 --> 02:13:58,825
Sam?

1297
02:14:01,357 --> 02:14:04,864
Sam, where you at?

1298
02:14:12,204 --> 02:14:15,719
Something's happening...

1299
02:14:26,499 --> 02:14:28,983
Quill?

1300
02:14:35,088 --> 02:14:38,595
- Stay, Quill.
- Oh, man...

1301
02:14:41,791 --> 02:14:43,486
Tony.

1302
02:14:46,268 --> 02:14:50,330
There was no other way.

1303
02:14:54,657 --> 02:14:56,766
Mr. Stark?

1304
02:14:59,915 --> 02:15:03,461
I don't feel so good...

1305
02:15:03,641 --> 02:15:07,563
- You're all right.
- I don't, I don't know what's happening...

1306
02:15:08,781 --> 02:15:12,187
I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go.
Mr. Stark, please...

1307
02:15:12,212 --> 02:15:14,945
Please. I don't wanna go.
I don't wanna go.

1308
02:15:19,013 --> 02:15:22,177
I'm sorry.

1309
02:15:35,331 --> 02:15:37,800
He did it.

1310
02:16:01,565 --> 02:16:05,456
What is this? What the
hell is happening?

1311
02:16:21,724 --> 02:16:24,583
Oh, God.

1312
02:17:08,087 --> 02:17:12,431
Subbed by: iamdepressed
Resynched+fixed by Clarity.

1313
02:27:19,849 --> 02:27:20,905
Search for Stark.

1314
02:27:21,005 --> 02:27:22,038
No not yet.

1315
02:27:22,138 --> 02:27:25,126
I'm watching every satellite above
kind of searching. Still nothing.

1316
02:27:26,240 --> 02:27:29,707
- What is it?
- Multiple bogets over wakanda.

1317
02:27:29,907 --> 02:27:31,645
Same energy signatures
as in New York?

1318
02:27:31,845 --> 02:27:33,266
10 times bigger.

1319
02:27:34,457 --> 02:27:36,316
Call Clint. We'll meet him...

1320
02:27:50,627 --> 02:27:52,325
They okay?

1321
02:27:52,525 --> 02:27:54,155
There is no one here.

1322
02:28:04,362 --> 02:28:06,230
Call control.

1323
02:28:06,430 --> 02:28:08,189
Code RED.

1324
02:28:08,389 --> 02:28:10,012

No!

1326
02:28:27,231 --> 02:28:28,989
Oh no!
