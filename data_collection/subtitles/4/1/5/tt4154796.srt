1
00:00:05,861 --> 00:00:07,533
- Can you see? 
- Yeah.

2
00:00:07,776 --> 00:00:08,831
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

3
00:00:08,855 --> 00:00:11,011
How about now? 
Can you see now?

4
00:00:13,644 --> 00:00:14,644
All right.

5
00:00:15,628 --> 00:00:17,433
Ready? Three fingers.

6
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:18,817
Nice!

7
00:00:20,438 --> 00:00:23,227
- Nice throw, kiddo!
- Go.

8
00:00:23,695 --> 00:00:27,164
Hey, you guys want mayo
or mustard, or both?

9
00:00:27,608 --> 00:00:29,687
Who wants mayo on a hotdog?

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,109
Pardon your brothers. Two mustards, please!
Thanks, momma.

11
00:00:33,156 --> 00:00:34,328
Got it.

12
00:00:34,414 --> 00:00:36,687
Nate, mayo or mustard?

13
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:38,718
I want ketchup.

14
00:00:41,069 --> 00:00:42,637
Mind your elbow...

15
00:00:44,734 --> 00:00:47,767
Good job, Hawkeye!
Go get your arrow.

16
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:53,742
Hey, guys. Enough practice.
Soup's on.

17
00:00:54,414 --> 00:00:57,234
All right. We're coming.
We're hungry.

18
00:00:58,101 --> 00:00:59,796
Lila, let's go.

19
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,893
Lila?

20
00:01:06,673 --> 00:01:07,673
Honey?

21
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,865
Babe?

22
00:01:22,407 --> 00:01:23,407
Babe?

23
00:01:25,392 --> 00:01:26,392
Babe?

24
00:01:28,642 --> 00:01:29,642
Boys!

25
00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:32,899
Boys?

26
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,111
Laura!

27
00:02:20,204 --> 00:02:21,766
You don't need to do that,

28
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:24,243
because you're just
holding the position.

29
00:02:25,665 --> 00:02:26,665
Come on.

30
00:02:27,085 --> 00:02:28,210
That was close.

31
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,592
That's a goal. We're
now one a-piece.

32
00:02:31,661 --> 00:02:33,317
I would like to try again.

33
00:02:35,668 --> 00:02:36,668
We're tied up.

34
00:02:36,692 --> 00:02:38,864
Feel the tension? It's fun.

35
00:02:39,677 --> 00:02:42,645
That was terrible. Now you
have a chance to win.

36
00:02:43,059 --> 00:02:45,895
And you won. Congratulations.

37
00:02:46,153 --> 00:02:47,645
Fair game.

38
00:02:48,466 --> 00:02:49,856
Good sport.

39
00:02:51,182 --> 00:02:52,466
You had fun?

40
00:02:54,453 --> 00:02:55,642
It was fun.

41
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:20,133
This thing on?

42
00:03:22,634 --> 00:03:24,774
Hey, Miss Potts... Pep.

43
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,563
If you find this recording...

44
00:03:28,915 --> 00:03:33,172
don't post it, on social media.
It's gonna be a real tear-jerker.

45
00:03:34,251 --> 00:03:36,227
I don't know if you're
ever gonna see these.

46
00:03:36,235 --> 00:03:38,635
I don't even know
if you're still...

47
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,797
Oh, God. I hope so...

48
00:03:41,802 --> 00:03:46,117
Today is day 21... uh, 22.

49
00:03:47,286 --> 00:03:49,911
You know, if it wasn't for
the existensial terror of

50
00:03:49,936 --> 00:03:52,075
staring into the
literal void of space,

51
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,262
I'd say, I'm feeling
more better today.

52
00:03:54,453 --> 00:03:58,507
The infection's run its course,
thanks to the blue meanie back there.

53
00:03:58,648 --> 00:04:01,421
You'd love her. Very practical.

54
00:04:01,812 --> 00:04:03,842
Only a tiny bit sadistic.

55
00:04:08,853 --> 00:04:12,768
Some fuel cells were cracked during battle, but
we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge

56
00:04:12,793 --> 00:04:15,649
to buy ourselves, about,
48 hours of playtime.

57
00:04:17,487 --> 00:04:19,213
But it's now dead in the water.

58
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:22,238
We're 1,000 lightyears
from the nearest 7-11.

59
00:04:22,263 --> 00:04:24,754
Oxygen will run out
tomorrow morning.

60
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:26,505
That'll be it.

61
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,530
And Pep, I...

62
00:04:27,555 --> 00:04:29,968
I know I said no
more surprises, but

63
00:04:29,993 --> 00:04:33,227
I gotta say I was really hoping
to pull off one last one.

64
00:04:33,252 --> 00:04:34,585
But it looks like...

65
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,618
Well, you know what
it looks like.

66
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,210
Don't feel bad about this.

67
00:04:38,235 --> 00:04:41,320
I mean actually if you
grovel for a couple weeks,

68
00:04:41,345 --> 00:04:43,878
and then, move on
with enormous guilt.

69
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:47,230
I should probably lie down.
I'm gonna caress my

70
00:04:47,255 --> 00:04:49,106
Please know that...

71
00:04:49,131 --> 00:04:52,451
When I drift off, it will be

72
00:04:52,476 --> 00:04:54,858
goodbye the whole time...

73
00:04:54,883 --> 00:04:56,562
I'll think about you.

74
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,673
Because it's always you.

75
00:05:45,497 --> 00:05:47,997
- Couldn't stop him.
- Neither could I.

76
00:05:51,457 --> 00:05:52,722
I lost the kid.

77
00:05:55,457 --> 00:05:57,392
Tony, we lost.

78
00:05:59,574 --> 00:06:01,136
Is, umm...

79
00:06:01,902 --> 00:06:03,347
Oh, my God!

80
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,684
It's okay.

81
00:06:18,483 --> 00:06:21,131
It's been 23 days since
Thanos came to Earth.

82
00:06:23,225 --> 00:06:25,817
World governments are in pieces.

83
00:06:25,842 --> 00:06:29,467
The parts that are still working
are trying to take a census,

84
00:06:29,475 --> 00:06:31,388
And it looks like he did...

85
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:37,981
He did exactly what he said he
was gonna do. Thanos wiped out..

86
00:06:39,821 --> 00:06:42,567
...fifty percent of
all living creatures.

87
00:06:47,034 --> 00:06:48,729
Where is he now? Where?

88
00:06:49,385 --> 00:06:50,612
We don't know.

89
00:06:51,197 --> 00:06:54,064
He just opened a portal
and walked through.

90
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:58,149
What's wrong with him?

91
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:00,104
He's pissed.

92
00:07:01,241 --> 00:07:02,741
He thinks he failed.

93
00:07:03,755 --> 00:07:06,989
Which of course he did, but there's a
lot of that goin' around, ain't there?

94
00:07:07,162 --> 00:07:10,369
Honestly, at this exact second, I
thought you were a Build-A-Bear.

95
00:07:10,394 --> 00:07:11,357
Maybe I am.

96
00:07:11,382 --> 00:07:13,319
We've been hunting Thanos
for three weeks now.

97
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:17,043
Deep space scans, and
satellites, and we got nothing.

98
00:07:19,218 --> 00:07:21,686
- Tony you fought him.
- Who told you that?

99
00:07:21,826 --> 00:07:22,826
Didn't fight him.

100
00:07:22,904 --> 00:07:25,145
No. He wiped my face
with a planet while a

101
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,514
Bleecker Street magician
gave away the stone.

102
00:07:27,592 --> 00:07:29,381
- That's what happened. There was no fight...
- Okay.

103
00:07:29,405 --> 00:07:30,155


104
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,867
Did he give you any clues?
Any coordinates, anything?

105
00:07:33,805 --> 00:07:34,805
Pfft!

106
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:39,086
I saw this coming a few years back. I had
a vision. I didn't wanna believe it.

107
00:07:39,663 --> 00:07:41,100
Thought I was dreaming.

108
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,967
- Tony I'm gonna need you to focus.
- And I needed you.

109
00:07:44,265 --> 00:07:48,381
As in past tense. That trumps what
you need. It's too late, buddy.

110
00:07:48,749 --> 00:07:49,749
Sorry.

111
00:07:50,866 --> 00:07:53,467
You know what I need?
I need to shave.

112
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:57,764
- And I believe I rememeber telling
- Tony, Tony, Tony...

113
00:07:57,827 --> 00:07:59,711
why that otherwise,

114
00:07:59,736 --> 00:08:04,190
that what we needed was a suit of armor
around the world. Remember that?

115
00:08:04,215 --> 00:08:08,660
Whether it impacted our precious
freedoms, or not. That's what we needed.

116
00:08:08,685 --> 00:08:11,224
- Well that didn't work out, did it?
- I said we'd lose.

117
00:08:11,337 --> 00:08:14,212
You said, "We'll do
that together, too."

118
00:08:14,268 --> 00:08:16,899
Well guess what, Cap? We lost.

119
00:08:16,938 --> 00:08:19,338
You weren't there.

120
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,750
But that's what we do, right?
Our best work after the fact?

121
00:08:22,775 --> 00:08:26,016
We're the Avengers? We're the Avengers?
Not the Prevengers?

122
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,736
Okay. You made your point.
Just sit down, okay?

123
00:08:28,838 --> 00:08:31,408
- No, no. Here's my... She's great, by the way.
- Tony, sit, sit down!

124
00:08:31,456 --> 00:08:33,862
We need you. You're new blood.
Bunch of tired old mills...

125
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,380
I got nothing for you, Cap.
I got no coordinates,

126
00:08:37,405 --> 00:08:40,314
no clues, no strategies,
no options...

127
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:44,295
Zero. Zip. Nada. No
trust, you liar...

128
00:08:48,655 --> 00:08:51,662
Here, take this. You find
him and you put that on.

129
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:53,804
You hide.

130
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:58,344
- Tony!
- I'm fine. I...

131
00:09:05,674 --> 00:09:09,455
Bruce gave him a sedative. He's gonna
probably be out for the rest of the day.

132
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:13,174
You guys take care of him. And I'll bring
an Bezurian elixir when I come back.

133
00:09:13,822 --> 00:09:16,298
- Where are you going?
- To kill Thanos.

134
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,282
Hey.

135
00:09:20,946 --> 00:09:23,025
You know we usually work
as a team here, and

136
00:09:23,074 --> 00:09:25,024
between you and I we're
also a little fragile.

137
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,649
We realize up there is more your
territory but this is our fight, too.

138
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:31,196
- You even know where he is?
- I know people who might.

139
00:09:31,242 --> 00:09:32,992
Don't bother.

140
00:09:33,578 --> 00:09:35,913
I can tell you where Thanos is.

141
00:09:38,086 --> 00:09:40,828
Thanos spent a long time
trying to perfect me.

142
00:09:41,561 --> 00:09:45,326
Then when he worked, he
talked about his great plan.

143
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:48,303
Even disassembled, I
wanted to please him.

144
00:09:48,858 --> 00:09:53,053
I'd ask, where would we go
once his plan was complete?

145
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,237
His answer was always the same.

146
00:10:00,406 --> 00:10:01,531
To The Garden.

147
00:10:01,789 --> 00:10:04,820
That's cute. Thanos has
a retirement plan.

148
00:10:04,845 --> 00:10:06,493
So where is he, then?

149
00:10:06,556 --> 00:10:08,304
When Thanos snapped his fingers,

150
00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:12,860
Earth became ground zero for a power surge
of ridiculously cosmic proportions.

151
00:10:12,907 --> 00:10:17,188
No one's ever seen anything like it...
until two days ago.

152
00:10:18,321 --> 00:10:20,617
On this planet.

153
00:10:20,946 --> 00:10:22,289
Thanos is there.

154
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,601
He used the stones again.

155
00:10:25,937 --> 00:10:27,004
Hey, hey, hey...

156
00:10:27,805 --> 00:10:30,057
We'd be going in
short-handed, you know?

157
00:10:30,082 --> 00:10:32,535
- Look, he still got the stones, so...
- So let's get him.

158
00:10:33,012 --> 00:10:35,706
- We use them to bring everyone back.
- Just like that?

159
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:37,696
Yeah. Just like that.

160
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:40,876
Even if there's a small chance
that we can undo this...

161
00:10:40,901 --> 00:10:43,657
I mean, we owe it to everyone
who's not in this room to try.

162
00:10:43,682 --> 00:10:47,924
If we do this, how do we know it's gonna
end any differently than it did before?

163
00:10:47,969 --> 00:10:50,109
Because before, you
didn't have me.

164
00:10:50,437 --> 00:10:54,655
Hey, new girl, everybody in this
room is about that superhero life.

165
00:10:54,911 --> 00:10:57,612
And if you don't mind my asking, where
the hell have you been all this time?

166
00:10:57,637 --> 00:11:00,183
There are a lot of other
planets in the universe.

167
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:03,028
And unfortunately, they
didn't have you guys.

168
00:11:22,483 --> 00:11:23,764
I like this one.

169
00:11:29,107 --> 00:11:31,724
Let's go get this
son of a bitch.

170
00:11:53,385 --> 00:11:57,173
Okay. Who here hasn't
been to space?

171
00:11:59,571 --> 00:12:01,797
You better not throw
up on my ship.

172
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,391
Approaching jump in 3.. 2.. 1.

173
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,231
I'll head down for recon.

174
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,976
- This is gonna work Steve.
- I know it will.

175
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,584
Because I don't know what
I'm gonna do if it doesn't.

176
00:12:48,826 --> 00:12:54,427
No satellites, no ships, no armies,
no ground defenses of any kind.

177
00:12:55,989 --> 00:12:57,301
It's just him.

178
00:12:58,309 --> 00:13:00,059
Then that's enough.

179
00:14:29,483 --> 00:14:30,756
Oh, no.

180
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:41,924
Where are they?

181
00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:44,604
Answer the question.

182
00:14:46,104 --> 00:14:48,908
The universe
required correction.

183
00:14:49,003 --> 00:14:54,272
After that, the stones served
no purpose, beyond temptation.

184
00:14:54,343 --> 00:14:56,116
You murdered trillions!

185
00:14:57,388 --> 00:14:59,075
You should be grateful.

186
00:15:02,974 --> 00:15:06,028
- Where are the stones?
- Gone.

187
00:15:06,611 --> 00:15:10,111
- Reduced to atoms.
- You used them two days ago.

188
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:13,314
I used the stones to
destroy the stones.

189
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,798
It nearly killed me.

190
00:15:16,994 --> 00:15:21,126
But the work is done.
It always will be.

191
00:15:23,668 --> 00:15:27,050
I am inevitable.

192
00:15:29,097 --> 00:15:31,636
We have to tear this place apart.
He has to be lying.

193
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,326
My father is many things.

194
00:15:33,761 --> 00:15:36,323
A liar is not one of them.

195
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,324
Thank you, Daughter.

196
00:15:43,885 --> 00:15:46,465
Perhaps I treated
you too harshly...

197
00:15:52,622 --> 00:15:55,809
What... what did you do?

198
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:59,621
I went for the head.

199
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:11,616
So I, uh...

200
00:17:13,304 --> 00:17:15,436
Went on a date the other day.

201
00:17:16,378 --> 00:17:20,379
It's the first time in five years,
you know? Sit there, dinner...

202
00:17:20,661 --> 00:17:23,262
I didn't know what
to talk about.

203
00:17:25,185 --> 00:17:26,785
What did you talk about?

204
00:17:26,826 --> 00:17:30,060
Same old crap, you know? How
things have changed, and...

205
00:17:30,856 --> 00:17:32,356
My job, his job....

206
00:17:32,841 --> 00:17:35,301
How much we miss the Mets.

207
00:17:37,739 --> 00:17:39,272
Then things get quiet..

208
00:17:41,216 --> 00:17:44,528
He cried as they were
serving the salads.

209
00:17:45,122 --> 00:17:46,481
What about you?

210
00:17:47,825 --> 00:17:50,817
I cried just before dessert.

211
00:17:54,403 --> 00:17:57,403
But I'm seeing him
again tomorrow, so...

212
00:17:57,403 --> 00:17:58,621
That's great.

213
00:17:58,653 --> 00:18:00,606
You did the hardest part.
You took the jump, you

214
00:18:00,631 --> 00:18:02,723
didn't know where you
were gonna come down.

215
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:07,674
And that's it. That's those little
brave baby steps you gotta take.

216
00:18:07,684 --> 00:18:11,269
To try and become whole again.
To try and find purpose.

217
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,871
I went in the ice in '45 right
after I met the love of my life.

218
00:18:18,308 --> 00:18:20,230
Woke up 70 years later.

219
00:18:22,965 --> 00:18:24,269
You got to move on.

220
00:18:27,785 --> 00:18:29,090
Got to move on.

221
00:18:34,388 --> 00:18:36,341
The world is in our hands.

222
00:18:36,661 --> 00:18:38,614
It's left to us guys.

223
00:18:38,778 --> 00:18:41,403
And we got to do
something with it.

224
00:18:42,052 --> 00:18:43,371
Otherwise...

225
00:18:44,642 --> 00:18:47,329
Thanos should've
killed all of us.

226
00:19:48,704 --> 00:19:50,680
What the hell?

227
00:20:02,487 --> 00:20:03,534
Hope?

228
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:39,426
Kid! Hey, kid!

229
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,882
What the hell happened here?

230
00:21:17,767 --> 00:21:18,845
My God...

231
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:26,571
No. Please. Please, please.
No, no, no...

232
00:21:32,617 --> 00:21:35,304
Excuse me. Sorry.
No, Cassie, no.

233
00:21:35,858 --> 00:21:36,858
No.

234
00:21:37,882 --> 00:21:38,882
No, no.

235
00:21:40,615 --> 00:21:42,529
Please, please,
please, please....

236
00:21:42,554 --> 00:21:43,554
No, Cassie...

237
00:21:50,796 --> 00:21:51,796
What?

238
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:23,198
Cassie?

239
00:22:24,495 --> 00:22:25,495
Dad?

240
00:22:51,911 --> 00:22:53,348
You're so big!

241
00:23:07,381 --> 00:23:11,912
Yeah, we boarded that highly
suspect warship Danvers pinged.

242
00:23:11,937 --> 00:23:13,991
It was an infectious
garbage scowl.

243
00:23:14,016 --> 00:23:15,522
So, thanks for the hot tip.

244
00:23:15,656 --> 00:23:18,381
- Well, you were closer.
- Yeah. And now we smell like garbage.

245
00:23:18,406 --> 00:23:20,278
You get a reading
on those tremors?

246
00:23:20,303 --> 00:23:22,795
It was a mild subduction
under the African plate.

247
00:23:22,914 --> 00:23:25,328
Do we have a visual? How
are we handling it?

248
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:28,593
Nat, it's an earthquake
under the ocean.

249
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:31,592
We handle it by not handling it.

250
00:23:32,374 --> 00:23:34,772
Carol, are we seeing
you here next month?

251
00:23:34,801 --> 00:23:37,850
- Not likely.
- What, you gonna get another haircut?

252
00:23:37,895 --> 00:23:41,511
Listen, fur-face. I'm
covering a lot of territory.

253
00:23:41,536 --> 00:23:43,411
The things that are
happening on Earth are

254
00:23:43,436 --> 00:23:46,302
happening everywhere, on
thousands of planets.

255
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,998
That's a good point.
That's a good point.

256
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:52,351
So you might not see
me for a long time.

257
00:23:52,572 --> 00:23:54,513
All right. Uh, well...

258
00:23:55,153 --> 00:23:59,457
This channel is always active.
So, anything goes sideways...

259
00:23:59,528 --> 00:24:01,949
Anyone's making trouble
where they shouldn't...

260
00:24:02,215 --> 00:24:05,097
- Comes through me.
- Okay.

261
00:24:05,113 --> 00:24:06,113
All right.

262
00:24:07,235 --> 00:24:08,535
Good luck.

263
00:24:16,874 --> 00:24:19,218
- Where are you?
- Mexico.

264
00:24:19,271 --> 00:24:22,226
The federales found a
room full of bodies.

265
00:24:22,468 --> 00:24:26,053
Looks like a bunch of cartel guys. Never
even had the chance to get their guns off.

266
00:24:26,124 --> 00:24:29,491
- It's probably a rival gang...
- Except it isn't.

267
00:24:29,516 --> 00:24:31,896
It's definitely Barton.

268
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:36,406
What he's done here, what he's
been doing for the last few years,

269
00:24:37,998 --> 00:24:40,060
I mean, the scene
that he left...

270
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:43,935
I gotta tell you, there's a part of
me that doesn't even wanna find him.

271
00:24:49,767 --> 00:24:52,102
Will you find out where
he's going next?

272
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,064
Nat...

273
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,829
Please.

274
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,460
Okay.

275
00:25:12,273 --> 00:25:16,343
You know I'd offer to clip your dinner
but you seem pretty miserable already.

276
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,499
You here to do your laundry?

277
00:25:21,524 --> 00:25:23,445
And to see a friend.

278
00:25:24,329 --> 00:25:26,266
Clearly, your friend is fine.

279
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:32,222
You know I saw a pod of whales
when I was coming up the bridge.

280
00:25:32,247 --> 00:25:35,364
- In the Hudson?
- There's fewer ships, cleaner water.

281
00:25:35,372 --> 00:25:39,426
You know, if you're about to tell
me to look on the bright side...

282
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:40,971
Um...

283
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,838
I'm about to hit you in the head
with a peanut butter sandwich.

284
00:25:47,737 --> 00:25:50,572
Sorry. Force of habit.

285
00:26:04,425 --> 00:26:08,635
You know I keep telling everybody
they should move on and... grow.

286
00:26:10,783 --> 00:26:11,915
Some do.

287
00:26:15,486 --> 00:26:16,657
But not us.

288
00:26:17,523 --> 00:26:21,843
- If I move on, who does this?
- Maybe it doesn't need to be done.

289
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:28,445
I used to have nothing.

290
00:26:29,594 --> 00:26:31,672
And then I got this.

291
00:26:33,969 --> 00:26:35,258
This job.

292
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:39,414
This family.

293
00:26:43,596 --> 00:26:47,275
And I was... I was
better because of it.

294
00:26:53,784 --> 00:26:55,096
And even though...

295
00:26:56,161 --> 00:26:57,629
they're gone...

296
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:03,559
Now, I'm still
trying to be better.

297
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,921
I think we both
need to get a life.

298
00:27:11,766 --> 00:27:13,007
You first.

299
00:27:18,195 --> 00:27:19,616
Oh... Hi. Hi!

300
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,582
Is anyone home?
This is Scott Lang.

301
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:27,255
We met a few years ago, at the airport?
In Germany?

302
00:27:27,287 --> 00:27:30,146
I got really big and
I had my mask on.

303
00:27:30,171 --> 00:27:32,091
- You wouldn't recognize me.
- Is this an old message?

304
00:27:32,116 --> 00:27:35,046
Ant-Man? Ant-Man, I
know you know that.

305
00:27:35,132 --> 00:27:36,155
It's the front gate.

306
00:27:36,186 --> 00:27:37,986
I need to talk to you guys.

307
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:44,850
Scott.

308
00:27:46,193 --> 00:27:48,200
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

309
00:27:49,864 --> 00:27:52,419
Have either of you guys ever
studied quantum physics?

310
00:27:52,748 --> 00:27:54,864
Only in mid-conversation.

311
00:27:55,052 --> 00:27:56,052
Alright. So...

312
00:27:57,155 --> 00:28:01,810
Five years ago, right before...
Thanos,

313
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:04,147
I was in a place called
the quantum realm.

314
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:07,186
The quantum realm is like its
own microscopic universe.

315
00:28:07,211 --> 00:28:10,750
To get in there, you have to be
incredibly small. Hope, she's my...

316
00:28:12,586 --> 00:28:14,102
She... she was my...

317
00:28:16,141 --> 00:28:19,843
She was supposed to pull me out.
And then Thanos happened, and

318
00:28:19,868 --> 00:28:23,539
- I got stuck in there.
- Sorry. That must've been a long 5 years.

319
00:28:23,564 --> 00:28:26,235
Yeah, but that's just it.
It wasn't.

320
00:28:26,243 --> 00:28:27,977
For me it was five hours.

321
00:28:28,002 --> 00:28:30,565
See, the rules of the quantum realm
aren't like they are up here.

322
00:28:30,611 --> 00:28:35,040
Everything is unpredictable. Is that
anybody's sandwich? I'm starving.

323
00:28:35,353 --> 00:28:36,353
Scott.

324
00:28:36,439 --> 00:28:38,329
What are you talking about?

325
00:28:38,921 --> 00:28:39,921
So...

326
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:42,819
What I'm saying is...

327
00:28:43,536 --> 00:28:45,887
Time works differently
in the quantum realm.

328
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:49,653
The only problem is right now, we
don't have a way to navigate it.

329
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:51,037
But what if we did?

330
00:28:51,085 --> 00:28:54,810
I can't stop thinking about it. What
if we could somehow control the chaos,

331
00:28:54,835 --> 00:28:58,317
and we could navigate it? What if
there was a way that we can enter

332
00:28:58,342 --> 00:29:00,787
the quantum realm at a certain
point in time but then

333
00:29:00,812 --> 00:29:03,912
exit the quantum realm at
another point in time? Like...

334
00:29:05,191 --> 00:29:06,792
Like before Thanos.

335
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,281
Wait, are you talking
about a time machine?

336
00:29:09,306 --> 00:29:12,426
No. No, of course not.
No, not a time machine.

337
00:29:12,575 --> 00:29:14,630
It's more like a...

338
00:29:15,862 --> 00:29:19,369
Yeah, a time machine. I know it's crazy.
It's crazy.

339
00:29:19,932 --> 00:29:23,299
But I can't stop thinking about it.
There's gotta be...

340
00:29:23,674 --> 00:29:26,513
Some wa... It's crazy.

341
00:29:26,538 --> 00:29:30,483
I get e-mails from a raccoon. So,
nothing sounds crazy anymore.

342
00:29:31,288 --> 00:29:33,366
So who do we talk to about this?

343
00:29:51,418 --> 00:29:52,418
Chow-time!

344
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,880
Morgoona.

345
00:30:00,372 --> 00:30:02,583
Morgan H. Stark.
Want some lunch?

346
00:30:02,763 --> 00:30:05,661
- Define lunch or be disintegrated.
- Okay.

347
00:30:06,669 --> 00:30:08,019
You should not be
wearing that, okay?

348
00:30:08,044 --> 00:30:10,925
That is part of a special anniversary
gift I'm making for Mom.

349
00:30:14,316 --> 00:30:16,518
There you go. Are you
thinking about lunch?

350
00:30:17,034 --> 00:30:19,190
Want a handful of crickets?

351
00:30:19,253 --> 00:30:21,095
- No.
- That's what you want.

352
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,534
- How did you find this?
- Garage.

353
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:25,343
Really?

354
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:27,726
- Were you looking for it?
- No.

355
00:30:28,249 --> 00:30:29,920
I found it, though.

356
00:30:30,209 --> 00:30:33,435
You like going to the garage, huh?
So does Daddy.

357
00:30:34,467 --> 00:30:37,415
It's fine actually. Mom never
wears anything I wear.

358
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,193
Now, we know what
it sounds like...

359
00:31:01,266 --> 00:31:03,218
Tony after everything you've seen,
is anything really impossible...

360
00:31:03,242 --> 00:31:05,631
Quantum fluctuation messes
with the Planck scale,

361
00:31:05,656 --> 00:31:08,664
which then triggers the Deutsch
proposition. Can we agree on that?

362
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,820
Thank you.

363
00:31:09,859 --> 00:31:12,515
In Layman's terms, it means
you're not coming home.

364
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,540
- I did.
- No.

365
00:31:13,578 --> 00:31:15,574
You accidentally survived. It's a---

366
00:31:15,621 --> 00:31:18,129
It's a billion-to-one
cosmic fluke.

367
00:31:18,197 --> 00:31:19,964
And now you wanna pull a...

368
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:21,587
What do you call it?

369
00:31:23,305 --> 00:31:26,015
- A time heist?
- Yeah. Time heist.

370
00:31:26,289 --> 00:31:28,456
Of course. Why didn't we
think of this before?

371
00:31:28,481 --> 00:31:30,972
Oh! Because it's laughable?
Because it's a pipedream?

372
00:31:30,997 --> 00:31:34,442
The stones are in the past. We
can go back and we can get them.

373
00:31:34,467 --> 00:31:36,973
We can snap our own fingers.
We can bring everybody back.

374
00:31:36,998 --> 00:31:39,139
Or screw it up worse than
he already has, right?

375
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:40,404
I don't believe we would.

376
00:31:40,529 --> 00:31:43,841
Gotta say this. Sometimes, I
miss that giddy optimism.

377
00:31:44,121 --> 00:31:47,136
However, high hopes won't
help if there's no logical,

378
00:31:47,161 --> 00:31:51,457
tangible, way for me to safely
execute said time heist.

379
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:54,577
I believe the most likely outcome
will be our collective demise.

380
00:31:54,602 --> 00:31:57,609
Not if we strictly follow
the rules of time travel.

381
00:31:57,836 --> 00:32:01,781
That means no talking to our past selves,
no betting on sporting events...

382
00:32:01,813 --> 00:32:04,343
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Scott.

383
00:32:04,899 --> 00:32:06,968
Are you seriously telling
me that your plan to

384
00:32:06,993 --> 00:32:10,093
save the universe is based
on Back to the Future?

385
00:32:12,036 --> 00:32:14,114
- No.
- Good. You had me worried there.

386
00:32:14,136 --> 00:32:17,409
'Cause that'd be horseshit. That's
not how quantum physics works.

387
00:32:17,662 --> 00:32:18,662
Tony...

388
00:32:20,662 --> 00:32:22,552
We have to take a stand.

389
00:32:22,951 --> 00:32:25,701
We did stand. And
yet, here we are.

390
00:32:27,138 --> 00:32:30,904
I know you got a lot on the line.
You got a wife, a daughter.

391
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:35,990
But I lost someone very important to me.
A lot of people did.

392
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:40,464
And now, now, we have a chance to bring
her back. To bring everyone back.

393
00:32:40,489 --> 00:32:42,090
And you're telling me
that you won't even...

394
00:32:42,115 --> 00:32:44,122
That's right, Scott.
I won't. Leave it.

395
00:32:45,739 --> 00:32:47,348
Got a kid.

396
00:32:49,192 --> 00:32:51,442
Mommy told me to
come and save you.

397
00:32:51,467 --> 00:32:54,113
Good job. I'm saved.

398
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:56,855
I wish you'd come here to
ask me something else.

399
00:32:56,871 --> 00:32:59,784
Anything else. Honestly, I
missed you guys, it was...

400
00:32:59,863 --> 00:33:02,972
- Oh, and table's set for six.
- Tony, I get it.

401
00:33:03,089 --> 00:33:05,479
And I'm happy for you.
I really am.

402
00:33:06,097 --> 00:33:08,057
But this is a second chance.

403
00:33:08,355 --> 00:33:10,792
I got my second chance
right here, Cap.

404
00:33:10,891 --> 00:33:13,008
I can't roll the dice again.

405
00:33:14,497 --> 00:33:17,200
If you don't talk shop,
you can stay for lunch.

406
00:33:19,951 --> 00:33:22,522
- He's scared.
- He's not wrong.

407
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,966
Yeah, but I mean,
what are we gonna do?

408
00:33:25,099 --> 00:33:27,231
We need him. What,
are we gonna stop?

409
00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:29,162
No. I wanna do it right.

410
00:33:32,433 --> 00:33:34,613
We're gonna need a
really big brain.

411
00:33:34,964 --> 00:33:36,690
Bigger than his?

412
00:33:37,041 --> 00:33:39,869
Come on. I feel like I'm the only
one eating. Try some of that.

413
00:33:39,894 --> 00:33:41,127
Have some eggs.

414
00:33:41,393 --> 00:33:42,674
I'm so confused.

415
00:33:42,702 --> 00:33:45,350
- These are confusing times.
- Right. No, no...

416
00:33:45,374 --> 00:33:48,256
- That's not what I meant. I...
- No, I get it.

417
00:33:48,281 --> 00:33:51,687
I'm kidding! I know. It's crazy.

418
00:33:51,812 --> 00:33:56,082
- I'm wearing shirts now.
- Yeah! How? Why?

419
00:33:56,222 --> 00:33:58,770
Five years ago we
got our asses beat.

420
00:33:59,239 --> 00:34:02,146
Except it was worse for me.
Because I lost twice.

421
00:34:02,389 --> 00:34:06,488
First, Hulk lost. Then Banner lost.
Then, we all lost.

422
00:34:06,513 --> 00:34:09,357
- No one blamed you, Bruce.
- I did.

423
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,791
For years I've been
treating the Hulk like he's

424
00:34:12,816 --> 00:34:15,252
some kind of disease,
something to get rid of.

425
00:34:16,026 --> 00:34:18,908
But then I started looking
at him as the cure.

426
00:34:18,975 --> 00:34:24,029
Eighteen months in a gamma lab. I put
the brains and the brawn together.

427
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:27,943
And now look at me.
Best of both worlds.

428
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,227
- Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
- Yes?

429
00:34:30,252 --> 00:34:33,861
- Can we get a photo?
- 100%, little person.

430
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:36,705
Come on, step on up. You mind?

431
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:37,730
Oh.

432
00:34:38,411 --> 00:34:41,036
- Say "green."
- Green.

433
00:34:41,061 --> 00:34:42,715
Greeeen.

434
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:45,443
- Did you get that?
- That's good.

435
00:34:45,771 --> 00:34:48,779
Don't you wanna grab one with me?
I'm Ant-Man.

436
00:34:51,552 --> 00:34:53,206
They're Hulk fans.
They don't know Ant-Man.

437
00:34:53,231 --> 00:34:55,417
- Nobody does.
- Wait, no, no, he wants to...

438
00:34:55,442 --> 00:34:57,964
You want to take a
picture with him, right?

439
00:34:57,989 --> 00:35:00,106
He's even saying no he doesn't.
I get it.

440
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:03,090
I don't want it either. I don't
want a picture with them.

441
00:35:03,092 --> 00:35:04,998
- He's gonna feel bad.
- Sorry.

442
00:35:05,029 --> 00:35:07,373
- They said they'd do it.
- I don't want it anymore.

443
00:35:07,398 --> 00:35:09,904
- You'd feel bad...
- Take the goddamn phone.

444
00:35:11,021 --> 00:35:11,954
Thank you, Mr. Hulk.

445
00:35:11,979 --> 00:35:14,256
No, it's great, kids.
Thank you very much.

446
00:35:14,569 --> 00:35:16,725
- Hulk out!
- Bruce.

447
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,951
- Dab.
- Bruce.

448
00:35:18,976 --> 00:35:21,679
Listen to your Mom.
She knows better.

449
00:35:21,704 --> 00:35:24,671
- About we were saying...
- Right.

450
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:29,285
The whole time travel do-over?

451
00:35:30,698 --> 00:35:33,878
Guys, it's outside of
my area of expertise.

452
00:35:34,957 --> 00:35:36,839
Well, you pulled this off.

453
00:35:37,191 --> 00:35:40,644
I remember a time when that
seemed pretty impossible, too.

454
00:36:14,149 --> 00:36:16,852
Look at a mod inspiration,
let me see what checks out.

455
00:36:17,138 --> 00:36:21,005
So, recommend one last sim before
we pack it in for the night.

456
00:36:21,029 --> 00:36:25,630
This time, in the shape of a
mobius strip, inverted. Please?

457
00:36:25,655 --> 00:36:27,287
Processing...

458
00:36:30,451 --> 00:36:34,784
Give me that eigenvalue. That, particle
factoring, and spectral decomp.

459
00:36:34,809 --> 00:36:37,505
- Gotta take a second.
- Just a moment.

460
00:36:37,926 --> 00:36:41,152
And don't worry if it doesn't pan out.
I'm just kinda...

461
00:36:42,315 --> 00:36:44,424
Model rendered.

462
00:36:55,669 --> 00:36:56,669
Shit!

463
00:36:57,019 --> 00:36:58,019
Shit!

464
00:37:02,234 --> 00:37:04,140
What are you doing
up, Little Miss?

465
00:37:04,195 --> 00:37:05,999
- Shit.
- No. We don't say that.

466
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:09,265
Only Mommy says that word. She
coined it, it belongs to her.

467
00:37:09,273 --> 00:37:10,314
Why you up?

468
00:37:10,339 --> 00:37:12,964
'Cause I got some important shit
going on here. What do you think?

469
00:37:12,989 --> 00:37:16,126
No, I got something on my mind.
I got something on my mind.

470
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:20,136
- Was it Juice Pops?
- Sure was.

471
00:37:21,873 --> 00:37:24,013
That's extortion.

472
00:37:25,029 --> 00:37:28,880
Great minds think alike. Juice
Pops, exactly was on...

473
00:37:30,404 --> 00:37:31,755
my mind.

474
00:37:32,576 --> 00:37:35,747
You done? Yeah? Now you are.

475
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:44,184
- That face, goes there.
- Tell me a story.

476
00:37:44,451 --> 00:37:46,052
A story.

477
00:37:46,326 --> 00:37:48,857
Once upon a time, a little
girl went to bed. The end.

478
00:37:48,896 --> 00:37:50,226
That ain't the whole story.

479
00:37:50,251 --> 00:37:52,501
Come on, that's your
favorite story.

480
00:37:52,585 --> 00:37:54,053
I love you tons.

481
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,295
I love you 3,000.

482
00:37:59,202 --> 00:38:00,202
Wow.

483
00:38:07,338 --> 00:38:10,361
3,000. That's crazy.

484
00:38:11,198 --> 00:38:13,731
Go to bed. Or I'll
sell all your toys.

485
00:38:14,065 --> 00:38:15,260
Night-night.

486
00:38:16,033 --> 00:38:19,705
Not that it's a competition,
but she loves me 3,000.

487
00:38:20,502 --> 00:38:24,400
You were somewhere in
the low 6 to 900 range.

488
00:38:30,037 --> 00:38:34,076
- What you reading?
- Just a book on composting.

489
00:38:34,101 --> 00:38:36,318
What's new with composting?

490
00:38:37,584 --> 00:38:39,217
- Just ....
- I figured it out...

491
00:38:40,225 --> 00:38:41,693
by the way.

492
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:45,473
You know, just so we're talking
about the same thing...

493
00:38:45,919 --> 00:38:47,301
Time travel.

494
00:38:48,434 --> 00:38:49,434
What?

495
00:38:52,896 --> 00:38:53,896
Wow.

496
00:38:56,193 --> 00:38:57,193
That's...

497
00:38:57,966 --> 00:39:01,693
Amazing, and.... terrifying.

498
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:02,935
That's right.

499
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,836
- I got really lucky.
- Yeah. I know.

500
00:39:14,906 --> 00:39:18,031
- A lot of people didn't.
- No, I can't help everybody.

501
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:22,269
- It sorta seems like you can.
- Not if I stop.

502
00:39:23,816 --> 00:39:27,011
I can put a pin in it
right now, and stop.

503
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:28,636
Tony...

504
00:39:29,121 --> 00:39:34,253
trying to get you to stop has been one
of the few failures of my entire life.

505
00:39:38,123 --> 00:39:43,740
I sometimes feel I should put it in a locked
box and drop it at the bottom of a lake...

506
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:46,333
...go to bed.

507
00:39:52,062 --> 00:39:54,570
But would you be able to rest?

508
00:39:59,069 --> 00:40:02,154
Okay, here we go. Time
travel test number one.

509
00:40:02,374 --> 00:40:07,069
Scott, fire up the, uhh...
The van thing.

510
00:40:08,977 --> 00:40:12,470
Breakers are set. Emergency
generators are on standby.

511
00:40:12,501 --> 00:40:17,345
Good. 'Cause if we blow the grid, I don't
wanna lose Tiny here in the 1950's.

512
00:40:17,439 --> 00:40:19,759
- Excuse me?
- He's kidding.

513
00:40:20,024 --> 00:40:21,843
You can't say things like that.

514
00:40:21,868 --> 00:40:24,969
Just... it was, just a bad joke.

515
00:40:26,321 --> 00:40:28,594
- You were kidding, right?
- I have no idea.

516
00:40:28,671 --> 00:40:32,811
We're talking about time travel here.
Either it's all a joke, or none of it is.

517
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:35,982
We're good! Get your helmet on.

518
00:40:36,693 --> 00:40:39,419
Scott, I'm gonna send you
back a week, but you'll walk

519
00:40:39,444 --> 00:40:42,443
around for an hour, then bring
you back in 10 seconds.

520
00:40:42,623 --> 00:40:45,069
- Makes sense?
- Perfectly not confusing.

521
00:40:45,094 --> 00:40:47,695
Good luck, Scott. You got this.

522
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:52,447
You're right. I do,
Captain America.

523
00:40:54,103 --> 00:40:59,946
On the count of three.
3.. 2.. 1..

524
00:41:03,701 --> 00:41:06,982
Guys? This doesn't feel right.

525
00:41:07,122 --> 00:41:08,990
- What's going on? Hold on.
- Who is that?

526
00:41:09,015 --> 00:41:11,022
- Is that Scott?
- Yes, it's Scott!

527
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:15,807
Ooh! My back!

528
00:41:18,373 --> 00:41:20,815
- Can you bring him back?
- I'm working on it!

529
00:41:27,752 --> 00:41:28,752
A baby.

530
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:30,362
- It's Scott.
- As a baby!

531
00:41:31,032 --> 00:41:32,088
Bring Scott back.

532
00:41:32,113 --> 00:41:34,408
When I say kill the
power, kill the power.

533
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:37,689
And... kill it!

534
00:41:41,138 --> 00:41:43,528
Somebody peed my pants.

535
00:41:44,786 --> 00:41:47,793
I don't know if it was
"baby" me or "old" me.

536
00:41:51,155 --> 00:41:53,163
Or, just "me" me.

537
00:41:53,218 --> 00:41:55,046
Time travel!

538
00:41:58,570 --> 00:41:59,570
What?

539
00:42:00,913 --> 00:42:03,709
I see this as an absolute win.

540
00:42:48,909 --> 00:42:50,112
Why the long face?

541
00:42:50,175 --> 00:42:52,104
Let me guess. He
turned into a baby.

542
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:55,317
Among other things, yeah.
What are you doing here?

543
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,340
That's the EPR paradox.

544
00:42:57,536 --> 00:43:01,185
Instead of pushing Lang through time, you
might've wound up pushing time through Lang.

545
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:04,161
It's tricky. Dangerous. Somebody
coulda cautioned you against it.

546
00:43:04,171 --> 00:43:06,592
- You did.
- Oh, did I?

547
00:43:07,315 --> 00:43:11,893
Thank God, I'm here.
Regardless, I fixed it.

548
00:43:11,918 --> 00:43:14,338
A fully functioning
time-space GPS.

549
00:43:16,359 --> 00:43:18,425
I just want peace.

550
00:43:18,968 --> 00:43:22,257
Turns out, resentment is
corrosive, and I hate it.

551
00:43:22,771 --> 00:43:24,091
Me, too.

552
00:43:25,356 --> 00:43:27,189
We got a shot at getting
these stones, but I

553
00:43:27,214 --> 00:43:28,965
gotta tell you my
priority is to bring back

554
00:43:28,995 --> 00:43:31,384
what we lost? I hope, yes.

555
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:34,276
Keep what I found? I
have to, at all costs.

556
00:43:35,503 --> 00:43:39,346
And, maybe not die
trying will be nice.

557
00:43:41,737 --> 00:43:43,635
Sounds like a deal.

558
00:44:06,683 --> 00:44:10,729
- Tony, I don't know...
- Why? He made it for you.

559
00:44:11,378 --> 00:44:15,784
Plus, honestly I have to get it out the
garage before Morgan takes it sledding.

560
00:44:20,516 --> 00:44:21,891
Thank you, Tony.

561
00:44:22,633 --> 00:44:26,781
Will you keep that a little quietly?
Didn't bring one for the whole team.

562
00:44:27,904 --> 00:44:33,380
- We are getting, the whole team, yeah?
- We're working on that right now.

563
00:44:51,478 --> 00:44:56,986
- Hey, humie! Where's big green?
- Kitchen. I think.

564
00:44:58,284 --> 00:45:02,549
- That's awesome.
- Rodent, careful on re-entry.

565
00:45:02,565 --> 00:45:05,166
There's an idiot on
the landing zone.

566
00:45:05,687 --> 00:45:06,687
Oh, God!

567
00:45:07,585 --> 00:45:10,069
What's up, regular-sized man?

568
00:46:00,411 --> 00:46:04,848
Kind of a step down from a golden palace
for an Avenger highness or whatnot.

569
00:46:04,873 --> 00:46:07,364
Hey, have a little compassion, pal.
First, they've lost Asgard,

570
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:10,280
then half the people. They're probably
just happy they have a home.

571
00:46:10,305 --> 00:46:12,422
You shouldn't have come!

572
00:46:13,914 --> 00:46:14,914
Valkyrie!

573
00:46:15,456 --> 00:46:17,791
Great to see you, Angry Girl.

574
00:46:18,088 --> 00:46:21,220
I think I liked you better
either of the other ways.

575
00:46:21,665 --> 00:46:23,844
- This is Rocket.
- How you doin'?

576
00:46:25,907 --> 00:46:28,032
- He won't see you.
- That bad, huh?

577
00:46:28,432 --> 00:46:30,721
We only see him once a month,
when he comes in for...

578
00:46:31,971 --> 00:46:33,361
...supplies.

579
00:46:33,915 --> 00:46:35,915
- It's that bad.
- Yeah.

580
00:46:48,612 --> 00:46:49,737
What the...

581
00:46:52,286 --> 00:46:55,348
Woo! Something died in here.

582
00:46:55,989 --> 00:46:58,207
Hello? Thor?

583
00:46:58,676 --> 00:47:00,808
Are you here about the cable?

584
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:06,637
The Cinemax ran out two weeks ago,
and, sports were all kind of fuzzy...

585
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:19,131
Boys! Oh, my God!

586
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,967
My God! How have you been?

587
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:25,170
Come here, you little rascal!

588
00:47:25,654 --> 00:47:27,193
No, I'm good! I'm good.

589
00:47:27,568 --> 00:47:29,326
That's not necessary!

590
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:32,182
Hulk, you know my friends,
Miek, Korg, right?

591
00:47:32,214 --> 00:47:34,577
- Hey, boys!
- Hey, guys. Long time no see.

592
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:37,471
Beer's on the bucket. Feel
free to log on to the wi-fi.

593
00:47:37,496 --> 00:47:39,205
No password, obviously.

594
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:44,210
Thor, he's back. That kid on the TV
who's called me a dickhead again.

595
00:47:45,046 --> 00:47:48,273
- Noobmaster.
- Yeah, Noobmaster69.

596
00:47:50,906 --> 00:47:53,906
Noobmaster. Hey, it's Thor again.
You know, the God of Thunder?

597
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:56,976
Listen, buddy. If you don't log off
this game immediately I'm gonna fly

598
00:47:57,001 --> 00:47:59,820
home to your house, come down to
that basement you're hiding in,

599
00:47:59,845 --> 00:48:02,281
rip off your arms then
shove them up your butt!

600
00:48:02,697 --> 00:48:05,791
Oh, that's right. Yes, go cry to
your father, you little weasel!

601
00:48:06,095 --> 00:48:07,244
Thank you, Thor.

602
00:48:07,269 --> 00:48:08,855
Let me know if he
bothers you again, okay?

603
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,376
Thank you very much. I will.

604
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:12,602
So you guys want a drink?
What are you drinking?

605
00:48:12,627 --> 00:48:15,095
We have beer, tequila,
all sorts of things.

606
00:48:18,134 --> 00:48:20,689
Buddy, you all right?

607
00:48:20,736 --> 00:48:23,548
Yes, I'm fine! Why,
don't I look all right?

608
00:48:23,673 --> 00:48:25,720
You look like melted ice cream.

609
00:48:27,143 --> 00:48:29,588
So, what's up?

610
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:34,064
We need your help. There might be
a chance we could fix everything.

611
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,869
What, like the cable? 'Cause that's
been driving me bananas for weeks.

612
00:48:37,916 --> 00:48:39,307
Like Thanos.

613
00:48:58,017 --> 00:49:01,073
Don't say that name.

614
00:49:01,618 --> 00:49:04,681
Um, yeah. We don't actually
say that name in here.

615
00:49:09,498 --> 00:49:11,521
Please take your hand off me.

616
00:49:14,467 --> 00:49:15,467
Now, I know that...

617
00:49:16,981 --> 00:49:19,824
guy might scare you.

618
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:24,364
Why would I be? Why would, why
would I be scared of that guy?

619
00:49:24,951 --> 00:49:27,279
I'm the one who killed
that guy, remember?

620
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:30,458
Anyone else here
killed that guy?

621
00:49:33,399 --> 00:49:36,492
Nope. Didn't think so.

622
00:49:37,102 --> 00:49:41,227
Korg, why don't you, tell everybody
who chopped Thanos' big head off.

623
00:49:41,252 --> 00:49:43,016
Umm... Stormbreaker?

624
00:49:43,041 --> 00:49:45,563
Now, who's swinging
Stormbreaker?

625
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:52,307
I get it. You're in a rough spot, okay?
I've been there myself.

626
00:49:52,315 --> 00:49:54,557
You wanna know who
helped me out of it?

627
00:49:54,581 --> 00:49:57,533
I don't know. Is it... Natasha?

628
00:49:57,557 --> 00:49:58,721
It was you.

629
00:49:59,635 --> 00:50:01,283
You helped me.

630
00:50:02,939 --> 00:50:07,603
Why don't you ask the,
Asgardians down there,

631
00:50:07,627 --> 00:50:10,158
how much my help was worth.

632
00:50:15,038 --> 00:50:17,003
The ones that are left, anyway.

633
00:50:17,252 --> 00:50:19,034
I think we can bring them back.

634
00:50:19,526 --> 00:50:22,752
Stop. Just, stop...

635
00:50:23,677 --> 00:50:28,700
I know you think I'm down here wallowing in
my own self-pity, waiting to be rescued and

636
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:31,539
and saved. But I'm fine, okay?
We're fine, aren't we?

637
00:50:31,564 --> 00:50:32,812
Nah, all good here, mate!

638
00:50:32,837 --> 00:50:34,695
So, whatever it is that
you're offering, we're

639
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,070
not into it, don't care,
couldn't care less.

640
00:50:37,102 --> 00:50:38,226
Goodbye.

641
00:50:41,608 --> 00:50:42,882
We need you, pal.

642
00:50:52,664 --> 00:50:54,649
There's beer on the ship.

643
00:50:58,877 --> 00:51:00,010
What kind?

644
00:51:12,685 --> 00:51:15,035
It's him! He's after Akihiko!

645
00:51:45,887 --> 00:51:47,668
We never did anything to you!

646
00:52:00,096 --> 00:52:02,543
You're done hurting people.

647
00:52:08,687 --> 00:52:09,866
You're crazy!

648
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:40,847
Wait! Help me!

649
00:52:46,527 --> 00:52:47,996
What I want...

650
00:52:48,717 --> 00:52:50,161
You can't give me.

651
00:53:13,673 --> 00:53:15,352
You shouldn't be here.

652
00:53:17,352 --> 00:53:18,907
Neither should you.

653
00:53:24,955 --> 00:53:26,603
I've got a job to do.

654
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:30,282
Is that what you're
calling this?

655
00:53:30,892 --> 00:53:34,094
Killing all these people isn't
gonna bring your family back.

656
00:53:39,209 --> 00:53:40,802
We found something.

657
00:53:42,029 --> 00:53:44,130
A chance, maybe...

658
00:53:47,538 --> 00:53:48,623
Don't.

659
00:53:49,788 --> 00:53:51,155
Don't what?

660
00:53:53,858 --> 00:53:55,655
Don't give me hope.

661
00:53:58,972 --> 00:54:01,636
I'm sorry I couldn't
give it to you sooner.

662
00:54:23,077 --> 00:54:26,702
Drifting left. On the
side there, Lebowski.

663
00:54:29,828 --> 00:54:32,017
- Ratchet, how's it going?
- It's Rocket.

664
00:54:32,042 --> 00:54:35,135
Take it easy. You're only
a genius on Earth, pal.

665
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:36,190
Yup.

666
00:54:39,691 --> 00:54:42,206
Time travel suit? Not bad.

667
00:54:42,634 --> 00:54:44,275
Hey, hey, hey. Easy, easy!

668
00:54:44,306 --> 00:54:47,063
- I'm being very careful.
- No, you're being very Hulky.

669
00:54:47,072 --> 00:54:49,647
- I'm being careful.
- These are Pym particles, all right?

670
00:54:49,672 --> 00:54:52,423
And ever since Hank Pym got snapped
out of existence, this is it.

671
00:54:52,448 --> 00:54:54,501
This is what we have. We're
not making any more.

672
00:54:54,526 --> 00:54:56,271
- Scott, calm down.
- Sorry.

673
00:54:56,310 --> 00:54:58,675
We've got enough for
one round trip, each.

674
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:02,653
That's it. No do-overs.
Plus, two test runs.

675
00:55:07,206 --> 00:55:08,487
One test run.

676
00:55:09,284 --> 00:55:11,081
All right. I'm not
ready for this.

677
00:55:11,106 --> 00:55:12,190
I'm game.

678
00:55:14,745 --> 00:55:15,831
I'll do it.

679
00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:19,151
Clint, now you're gonna feel
a little discombobulated

680
00:55:19,176 --> 00:55:20,909
from the chronoshift.
Don't worry about it.

681
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:22,243
Wait a second, let me
ask you something.

682
00:55:22,268 --> 00:55:25,088
If we can do this, you know, go
back in time, why don't we just

683
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:28,299
find baby Thanos, you know?
And...

684
00:55:31,605 --> 00:55:33,846
- First of all, that's horrible.
- It's Thanos.

685
00:55:33,871 --> 00:55:38,410
And secondly, time doesn't work that way.
Changing the past doesn't change the future.

686
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:41,302
Look, we go back, we get the
stones before Thanos gets them...

687
00:55:41,327 --> 00:55:44,225
Thanos doesn't have the stones.
Problem solved.

688
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:46,107
- Bingo.
- That's not how it works.

689
00:55:46,132 --> 00:55:48,544
- Well, that's what I heard.
- What? By who? Who told you that?

690
00:55:48,577 --> 00:55:51,389
Star Trek, Terminator,
TimeCop, Time After Time,

691
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:52,739
- Quantum Leap.
- A Wrinkle in Time,

692
00:55:52,764 --> 00:55:55,262
- Somewhere in Time,
- Hot Tub Time Machine.

693
00:55:55,287 --> 00:55:59,544
Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Basically,
any movie that deals with time travel.

694
00:55:59,569 --> 00:56:01,413
Die Hard? No, it's not...

695
00:56:01,437 --> 00:56:02,476
This is known.

696
00:56:02,501 --> 00:56:04,843
I don't know why everyone believes
that, but that isn't true.

697
00:56:04,897 --> 00:56:09,186
Think about it: If you travel to the
past, that past becomes your future.

698
00:56:09,335 --> 00:56:12,556
And your former present
becomes the past.

699
00:56:12,642 --> 00:56:15,462
Which can't now be changed
by your new future...

700
00:56:15,506 --> 00:56:16,587
Exactly.

701
00:56:16,906 --> 00:56:19,562
So Back to the Future's
a bunch of bullshit?

702
00:56:24,384 --> 00:56:30,477
All right, Clint. We're going in 3..
2.. 1...

703
00:57:42,895 --> 00:57:44,043
Cooper?

704
00:57:44,247 --> 00:57:47,083
- Where are my headphones?
- Lila?

705
00:57:52,387 --> 00:57:53,997
Lila! No!

706
00:57:59,232 --> 00:58:00,232
Dad?

707
00:58:04,138 --> 00:58:05,216
Dad?

708
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,243
Hey, hey. Look at me. You okay?

709
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:20,095
Yeah.

710
00:58:22,992 --> 00:58:24,290
It worked.

711
00:58:25,942 --> 00:58:27,106
It worked.

712
00:58:30,489 --> 00:58:32,410
Okay, so the "how" works.

713
00:58:32,919 --> 00:58:36,208
Now we gotta figure out the
"when," and the "where."

714
00:58:37,134 --> 00:58:38,868
Almost everyone in this
room has had an encounter

715
00:58:38,893 --> 00:58:40,719
with at least one of the
six Infinity Stones.

716
00:58:40,759 --> 00:58:42,523
Well, I'd subtitute the
word 'encounter' for 'damn

717
00:58:42,548 --> 00:58:45,009
near been killed by one of
the six Infinity Stones.'

718
00:58:45,204 --> 00:58:48,625
I haven't. I don't even know what
the hell you're all talking about.

719
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:53,742
Regardless, we only have enough Pym
Particles for one round trip each,

720
00:58:53,789 --> 00:58:57,148
and these stones have been in a lot of
different places throughout history.

721
00:58:57,173 --> 00:59:01,343
Our history. So, not a lot of
convenient spots to just drop in.

722
00:59:01,531 --> 00:59:05,093
- Which means we have to pick our targets.
- Correct.

723
00:59:05,187 --> 00:59:08,358
So. Let's start
 with the Aether.

724
00:59:08,522 --> 00:59:10,459
Thor, what do you know?

725
00:59:15,436 --> 00:59:16,654
Is he asleep?

726
00:59:22,171 --> 00:59:24,506
Where to start? Umm...

727
00:59:25,648 --> 00:59:28,483
The Aether, first,
is not a stone.

728
00:59:28,663 --> 00:59:32,054
Someone's called it a stone before.
Ahem...

729
00:59:32,116 --> 00:59:35,819
It's more of a... an angry
sludge, sort of thing. So...

730
00:59:35,844 --> 00:59:38,984
Someone's gonna need to amend
that, and stop saying that.

731
00:59:39,191 --> 00:59:41,124
Here's an interesting
story, though.

732
00:59:41,205 --> 00:59:43,653
About the Aether. My
grandafther, many years

733
00:59:43,678 --> 00:59:47,681
ago, had to hide the stone
from the Dark Elves.

734
00:59:49,707 --> 00:59:51,488
Scary beings. So Jane...

735
00:59:52,832 --> 00:59:58,628
Oh, there she is. That's Jane...
She's... an old flame of mine.

736
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:02,634
She... she stuck her hand
inside a rock this one time...

737
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:05,993
and then the Aether stuck
itself inside her.

738
01:00:06,014 --> 01:00:09,217
And, she became very, very sick.
So I had to take her to

739
01:00:09,242 --> 01:00:12,976
Asgard, which is where I'm from.
And we had to try and fix her.

740
01:00:13,031 --> 01:00:18,648
We were dating at the time, you see. I
got to introduce her to my Mother...

741
01:00:20,064 --> 01:00:22,299
who's dead, and umm....

742
01:00:23,311 --> 01:00:27,108
Oh, you know. Jane and I aren't
even dating anymore, so...

743
01:00:27,443 --> 01:00:29,982
These things happen though, you know.
Nothing lasts forever.

744
01:00:30,007 --> 01:00:31,239
- The only thing that...
- Why don't you come sit down.

745
01:00:31,264 --> 01:00:35,663
I'm not done yet. The only thing that
is permanent in life, is impermanence.

746
01:00:36,421 --> 01:00:37,529
Awesome.

747
01:00:37,554 --> 01:00:38,725
Eggs? Breakfast?

748
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:40,688
No. I'd like a Bloody Mary.

749
01:00:40,747 --> 01:00:43,600
Quill said he stole the
Power Stone from Morag.

750
01:00:43,843 --> 01:00:47,155
- Is that a person?
- Morag's a planet.

751
01:00:47,434 --> 01:00:49,129
Quill was a person.

752
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:52,300
Like a planet? Like
in outer space?

753
01:00:52,425 --> 01:00:56,230
Oh, look. It's like a little
puppy, all happy and everything.

754
01:00:56,362 --> 01:00:59,885
Do you wanna go to space? You
wanna go to space, puppy?

755
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:02,133
I'll take you to space.

756
01:01:02,423 --> 01:01:06,055
- Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir.
- What is Vormir?

757
01:01:06,626 --> 01:01:11,118
A dominion of death, at the very
center of Celestial existence.

758
01:01:12,511 --> 01:01:16,300
It's where... Thanos
murdered my sister.

759
01:01:22,712 --> 01:01:23,712
Noted.

760
01:01:25,571 --> 01:01:27,672
- That Time Stone guy...
- Doctor Strange.

761
01:01:27,712 --> 01:01:29,258
Yeah, what kind
of doctor was he?

762
01:01:29,266 --> 01:01:32,922
- Neurostuff meets rabbit from a hat.
- Nice place in the village, though.

763
01:01:32,954 --> 01:01:35,405
- Yeah. Sullivan Street.
- Hmm... Bleecker.

764
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:37,039
Wait, he lived in New York?

765
01:01:37,304 --> 01:01:40,280
- No. He lived in Toronto.
- Yeah, not Bleecker. It's Sullivan.

766
01:01:40,652 --> 01:01:45,534
Guys, if you pick the right year,
there are three stones in New York.

767
01:01:47,816 --> 01:01:49,253
Shut the front door!

768
01:01:52,199 --> 01:01:54,737
All right. We have a plan.

769
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:59,447
Six stones, three
teams, one shot.

770
01:02:08,773 --> 01:02:10,875
Five years ago, we lost.

771
01:02:11,883 --> 01:02:13,062
All of us.

772
01:02:15,149 --> 01:02:16,196
We lost friends...

773
01:02:17,593 --> 01:02:18,687
We lost family...

774
01:02:21,067 --> 01:02:22,879
We lost a part of ourselves.

775
01:02:24,106 --> 01:02:26,567
Today, we have a chance
to take it all back.

776
01:02:27,784 --> 01:02:30,963
You know your teams, you
know your missions.

777
01:02:31,377 --> 01:02:34,205
Get the stones, get them back.

778
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:38,620
One round trip each. No mistakes.
No do-overs.

779
01:02:39,042 --> 01:02:41,258
Most of us are going
somewhere we know.

780
01:02:41,312 --> 01:02:43,999
But it doesn't mean we
should know what to expect.

781
01:02:44,218 --> 01:02:47,421
Be careful. Look out
for each other.

782
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:52,648
This is the fight of our lives.
And we're gonna win.

783
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:56,375
Whatever it takes.

784
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:00,367
Good luck.

785
01:03:01,046 --> 01:03:02,836
- He's pretty good at that.
- Right?

786
01:03:02,914 --> 01:03:05,851
All right. You heard the man.
Stroke those keys, jelly green.

787
01:03:06,561 --> 01:03:08,670
Tractors engaged.

788
01:03:09,047 --> 01:03:11,084
You promise to bring that
back in one piece, right?

789
01:03:11,109 --> 01:03:13,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah. Okay.

790
01:03:13,125 --> 01:03:16,883
- I'll do my best.
- As promises go, that was pretty lame.

791
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,922
See you in a minute.

792
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:18,453
All right, we all have our assignments.
Two stones uptown, one stone, down.

793
01:04:18,875 --> 01:04:21,257
Stay low. Keep an
eye on the clock.

794
01:04:36,089 --> 01:04:38,424
Feel free to smash if
things don't go your way.

795
01:04:39,214 --> 01:04:41,393
I think it's gratuitous,
but whatever.

796
01:05:08,825 --> 01:05:12,278
I'd be careful going that way.
We just had the floors waxed.

797
01:05:16,793 --> 01:05:19,433
Ma'am, I'm looking
for Doctor Strange.

798
01:05:20,722 --> 01:05:23,644
You're about... five
years too early.

799
01:05:24,034 --> 01:05:28,370
Stephen Strange is currently performing
surgery about twenty blocks that way.

800
01:05:29,671 --> 01:05:31,440
What do you want from him?

801
01:05:31,811 --> 01:05:33,342
That, actually.

802
01:05:33,631 --> 01:05:34,631
Ah.

803
01:05:35,968 --> 01:05:39,139
- I'm afraid not.
- Sorry, but I wasn't asking.

804
01:05:39,663 --> 01:05:41,591
- You don't wanna do this.
- You're right. I don't.

805
01:05:41,616 --> 01:05:44,850
But I need that stone, and
I don't have time to...

806
01:05:52,872 --> 01:05:54,848
Let's start over, shall we?

807
01:06:14,148 --> 01:06:15,304
That's Jane.

808
01:06:16,945 --> 01:06:18,023
All right.

809
01:06:19,623 --> 01:06:21,201
Here's the deal, Tubby:

810
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:23,299
You're gonna charm her and I'm
gonna poke her with this thing

811
01:06:23,324 --> 01:06:26,553
and extract the Reality Stone
and get gone, lickety-split.

812
01:06:27,601 --> 01:06:30,905
I'll be right back, okay? There's a
wine cellar, that's just down there.

813
01:06:30,930 --> 01:06:33,726
My father used to fish
with a barrel of ale.

814
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:37,984
- I'll see if the cellar has a couple of...
- Hey! Aren't you drunk enough already?

815
01:06:56,787 --> 01:06:58,677
Who's the fancy broad?

816
01:06:59,538 --> 01:07:03,202
It's my Mother.
She dies today.

817
01:07:04,287 --> 01:07:06,154
Oh. That's today?

818
01:07:12,290 --> 01:07:15,352
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

819
01:07:15,377 --> 01:07:18,711
I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't have come.
This was a bad idea.

820
01:07:18,821 --> 01:07:21,055
- Come here.
- No, no, no. I think I'm having...

821
01:07:21,094 --> 01:07:24,539
- I'm having a panic attack.
- Come here. Right here.

822
01:07:25,071 --> 01:07:28,953
You think you're the only one who lost
people? What do you think we're doing here?

823
01:07:28,978 --> 01:07:31,148
I lost the only
family I ever had.

824
01:07:31,173 --> 01:07:35,352
Quill, Groot, Drax, the chick
with the antenna, all gone.

825
01:07:35,954 --> 01:07:40,399
Now, I get you miss your Mom.
But she's gone. Really gone.

826
01:07:40,712 --> 01:07:43,540
And there are plenty of people
who are only kinda gone.

827
01:07:43,579 --> 01:07:45,392
But you can help them.

828
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:49,199
So is it too much to ask that you
brush the crumbs outta your beard,

829
01:07:49,224 --> 01:07:53,177
make schmoopy talk to Pretty
Pants, and when she's not looking,

830
01:07:53,404 --> 01:07:57,310
suck out the Infinity Stone and
help me get my family back?

831
01:07:58,245 --> 01:07:59,245
Okay.

832
01:07:59,713 --> 01:08:02,432
- Are you crying?
- No...

833
01:08:04,577 --> 01:08:05,577
Yes!

834
01:08:06,967 --> 01:08:09,514
Get it together!
You can do this.

835
01:08:10,108 --> 01:08:11,764
You can do this.

836
01:08:14,835 --> 01:08:16,014
All right?

837
01:08:16,343 --> 01:08:18,530
- Yes, I can.
- Good.

838
01:08:20,335 --> 01:08:22,756
I can do this.

839
01:08:23,756 --> 01:08:24,998
I can't do this.

840
01:08:25,178 --> 01:08:28,763
Alright, Heartbreaker. She's alone.
This is our shot.

841
01:08:28,818 --> 01:08:29,818
Thor?

842
01:08:30,451 --> 01:08:31,451
Thor!

843
01:08:41,753 --> 01:08:43,409
Alright. Bring it down low.

844
01:08:43,434 --> 01:08:45,977
Right on that line. That's it.
Down, down.

845
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:51,823
Hey, can we hurry it up?

846
01:08:51,848 --> 01:08:54,054
Guys, chop-chop. Come on.
We're on the clock.

847
01:08:54,199 --> 01:08:57,061
All that, is really helpful.

848
01:08:58,325 --> 01:09:00,019
- Take care, okay?
- Yeah.

849
01:09:00,139 --> 01:09:02,637
Take that stone and come back.
No messing around.

850
01:09:02,886 --> 01:09:04,698
- Hey.
- You got this.

851
01:09:04,795 --> 01:09:06,044
- Let's get it done.
- Yes, sir.

852
01:09:06,104 --> 01:09:07,716
See you back.

853
01:09:08,231 --> 01:09:10,154
You guys watch each other's six.

854
01:09:10,162 --> 01:09:11,162
Yeah.

855
01:09:20,076 --> 01:09:22,490
The coordinates for
Vormir are laid in.

856
01:09:23,277 --> 01:09:25,784
All they have to do
is not fall out.

857
01:09:31,188 --> 01:09:33,820
We're a long way from Budapest.

858
01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:39,489
Okay, so, uhh...

859
01:09:41,175 --> 01:09:44,119
We just wait around for this
Quill guy to show up and

860
01:09:44,144 --> 01:09:46,816
then he leads us to the
Power Stone, is that it?

861
01:09:47,277 --> 01:09:48,902
Let's take cover.

862
01:09:49,855 --> 01:09:52,886
We're not the only ones in
2014 looking for the stones.

863
01:09:53,011 --> 01:09:54,425
Wait a minute, what are
you talking about right

864
01:09:54,450 --> 01:09:56,393
now? Who else is looking
for these stones?

865
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:01,992
My father, my sister...

866
01:10:02,972 --> 01:10:05,456
- and me.
- And you?

867
01:10:07,134 --> 01:10:09,094
Where are you right now?

868
01:10:37,654 --> 01:10:40,920
- You're welcome.
- I didn't ask for your help.

869
01:10:41,646 --> 01:10:44,255
And yet, you always need it.

870
01:10:47,358 --> 01:10:48,475
Get up.

871
01:10:48,561 --> 01:10:50,920
- Father wants us back on the ship.
- Why?

872
01:10:50,975 --> 01:10:53,459
He's found an Infinity Stone.

873
01:10:57,163 --> 01:11:00,897
- Where?
- On a planet called Morag.

874
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:04,549
Father's plan is
finally in motion.

875
01:11:04,574 --> 01:11:07,933
- One stone isn't six, Nebula.
- It's a start.

876
01:11:08,094 --> 01:11:10,601
If he gets all of them...

877
01:11:22,542 --> 01:11:26,261
Ronan's located the Power Stone.
I'm dispatching you to his ship.

878
01:11:26,286 --> 01:11:29,644
- He won't like that.
- His alternative is death, then.

879
01:11:31,349 --> 01:11:36,239
Ronan's obsession
clouds his judgement.

880
01:11:40,512 --> 01:11:42,583
We will not fail you, Father.

881
01:11:43,685 --> 01:11:45,513
No, you won't.

882
01:11:48,046 --> 01:11:49,374
I swear...

883
01:11:50,868 --> 01:11:53,046
I will make you proud.

884
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:04,345
We just, wait around for
this Quill guy to show up,

885
01:12:04,370 --> 01:12:06,964
and then he leads us to the
Power Stone, is that it?

886
01:12:07,348 --> 01:12:08,824
Let's take cover.

887
01:12:09,722 --> 01:12:13,261
We're not the only ones in
2014 looking for the stones.

888
01:12:15,136 --> 01:12:17,331
- Who was that?
- I don't know...

889
01:12:17,393 --> 01:12:20,471
My head is splitting...
I don't know...

890
01:12:21,658 --> 01:12:24,991
Her synaptic drive was
probably damaged in battle.

891
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:36,618
Bring her to my ship.

892
01:12:44,598 --> 01:12:47,153
Got to hustle, Cap. Things look like
they're just about wrapped up here.

893
01:12:47,178 --> 01:12:49,763
Got it. I'm approaching
the elevator now.

894
01:12:55,682 --> 01:12:57,682
If it's all the same to you...

895
01:12:59,822 --> 01:13:01,489
I'll have that drink now.

896
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:06,181
All right. Good one. No standing around,
I'm closing up this door for later.

897
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:08,165
By the way, feel
free to clean up.

898
01:13:08,212 --> 01:13:10,821
Ugh, Mr. Rogers. I almost
forgot that that suit

899
01:13:10,867 --> 01:13:14,305
- did nothing for your ass.
- No one asked you to look.

900
01:13:14,364 --> 01:13:16,371
I think you look great, Cap.

901
01:13:16,396 --> 01:13:20,087
As far as I'm concerned,
that's America's ass.

902
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:23,306
- Uhh, magic wand?
- STRIKE team's coming to secure it.

903
01:13:33,449 --> 01:13:35,362
We can take that
off your hands.

904
01:13:35,464 --> 01:13:36,690
By all means.

905
01:13:38,512 --> 01:13:42,105
- Careful with that thing!
- Unless you want your mind erased.

906
01:13:42,130 --> 01:13:44,301
- Not in a fun way.
- We promise to be careful.

907
01:13:44,336 --> 01:13:47,156
- Who are these guys?
- They are SHIELD...

908
01:13:47,195 --> 01:13:50,054
Well, actually Hydra. But,
we didn't know that yet.

909
01:13:50,104 --> 01:13:54,088
Seriously, you didn't? I mean...
they look like bad guys.

910
01:13:54,135 --> 01:13:55,988
You're small, but
you're talking loud.

911
01:13:56,013 --> 01:13:57,626
On my way down to
coordinate search and rescue.

912
01:13:57,651 --> 01:13:59,777
On my way down to
coordinate search and rescue!

913
01:13:59,802 --> 01:14:02,572
I mean, honestly! How do
you think you'll be...

914
01:14:02,597 --> 01:14:03,817
Shut up.

915
01:14:05,247 --> 01:14:08,153
All right, you're up, little buddy.
There's our stone.

916
01:14:08,325 --> 01:14:10,817
Alright. Flick me.

917
01:14:25,954 --> 01:14:27,552
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa.
- Hey! Buddy.

918
01:14:27,587 --> 01:14:29,984
What do you think? Maximum
occupancy has been reached.

919
01:14:30,009 --> 01:14:32,844
- Take the stairs!
- Yeah. Stop. Stop!

920
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:38,746
Take the stairs.
Take the stairs!

921
01:14:42,082 --> 01:14:46,847
All right, Cap. I got our scepter in the
elevator just passing the 80th floor.

922
01:14:47,449 --> 01:14:48,465
On it.

923
01:14:49,152 --> 01:14:51,636
- Head to the lobby.
- Alright. I'll see you there.

924
01:14:51,661 --> 01:14:54,636
Evidence secure. We're
en route to Dr. List.

925
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:58,566
No. No hitches at all, Mr.
Secretary.

926
01:15:03,730 --> 01:15:06,707
Captain. I thought you were
coordinating search and rescue?

927
01:15:06,793 --> 01:15:08,441
Change of plans.

928
01:15:11,955 --> 01:15:13,042
Hey, Cap.

929
01:15:14,390 --> 01:15:15,628
Rumlow.

930
01:15:22,163 --> 01:15:26,194
I just got a call from the Secretary. I'm
gonna be running point on the scepter.

931
01:15:28,365 --> 01:15:31,114
Sir? I don't understand.

932
01:15:33,061 --> 01:15:35,178
We got word there may be
an attempt to steal it.

933
01:15:35,203 --> 01:15:36,452
Sorry, Cap.

934
01:15:36,881 --> 01:15:38,769
I can't give you the scepter.

935
01:15:38,903 --> 01:15:43,238
- I'm gonna have to call the Director.
- That's okay. Trust me.

936
01:15:46,753 --> 01:15:48,299
Hail Hydra.

937
01:16:02,281 --> 01:16:04,375
So many stairs!

938
01:16:15,873 --> 01:16:18,654
Thumbelina, do you copy?
I've got eyes on the prize.

939
01:16:18,678 --> 01:16:21,170
- It is go-time.
- Bombs away.

940
01:16:28,496 --> 01:16:30,613
Is, is that Axe body spray?

941
01:16:30,638 --> 01:16:33,411
Yeah, I had a can just
for emergencies. Relax.

942
01:16:33,481 --> 01:16:37,551
- Can we focus, please?
- I'm going inside you. Now.

943
01:16:42,901 --> 01:16:44,646
May I ask you
where you're going?

944
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:47,176
To lunch and then Asgard.
I'm sorry, you are?

945
01:16:47,201 --> 01:16:50,834
Alexander Pierce. He's the man, one
of the folks behind Nick Fury.

946
01:16:50,859 --> 01:16:52,325
My friends call me Mr. Secretary.

947
01:16:52,359 --> 01:16:54,827
I'm gonna have to ask you to
turn that prisoner over to me.

948
01:16:54,898 --> 01:16:57,952
- Loki will be answering to Odin himself.
- Oh, he's gonna answer to us.

949
01:16:57,977 --> 01:17:00,702
Odin can have what's left. And
I'm gonna need that case.

950
01:17:00,859 --> 01:17:02,859
That's been SHIELD property
for over 70 years.

951
01:17:02,884 --> 01:17:04,101
Hand over the case, Stark.

952
01:17:04,126 --> 01:17:06,767
All right, move it, Stuart Little. Things
are getting dicey up here. Let's go.

953
01:17:06,792 --> 01:17:08,959
I'm not gonna argue who's got the
higher authority here, all right?

954
01:17:08,984 --> 01:17:10,375
You promise me you won't die?

955
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:13,381
You're only giving me a
mild cardiac dysrythmia.

956
01:17:13,436 --> 01:17:15,139
That doesn't sound mild.

957
01:17:15,164 --> 01:17:15,783
I need the case.

958
01:17:15,808 --> 01:17:17,641
I know you got a lotta pull.
I'm just saying...

959
01:17:17,666 --> 01:17:19,455
Okay. Then give me the case.

960
01:17:21,377 --> 01:17:22,377
Do it, Lang!

961
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:25,127
- Get your hands off!
- Window's closing. Pull my pin!

962
01:17:25,290 --> 01:17:26,408
Here goes!

963
01:17:29,666 --> 01:17:31,541
- Stark?
- Stark!

964
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:33,587
Look, he's convulsing.
Give him air!

965
01:17:33,612 --> 01:17:35,619
- Medic!
- Medic!

966
01:17:35,877 --> 01:17:37,861
You got some help!

967
01:17:39,104 --> 01:17:41,689
Stark, you--- your
chest machine?

968
01:17:43,470 --> 01:17:44,720
Breathe! Breathe!

969
01:17:50,004 --> 01:17:52,949
Good job. Meet me in the alley.
I'm gonna grab a quick slice.

970
01:17:58,386 --> 01:18:00,480
No stairs!

971
01:18:08,032 --> 01:18:09,541
You'll be fine, Stark.
Stay with us!

972
01:18:09,572 --> 01:18:12,603
I'll try something, okay? I have
no idea if it's gonna work.

973
01:18:14,165 --> 01:18:14,837
Yes!

974
01:18:14,862 --> 01:18:17,119
That worked a treat.
That was so crazy!

975
01:18:17,135 --> 01:18:19,150
I had no idea if
that was gonna work.

976
01:18:19,175 --> 01:18:21,016
- The case...
- The case. It's, uhh...

977
01:18:21,057 --> 01:18:23,525
Where's the case? Where's Loki?

978
01:18:23,798 --> 01:18:24,798
Loki!

979
01:18:24,830 --> 01:18:27,939
- That wasn't supposed to happen, was it?
- Oh, we blew it.

980
01:18:27,986 --> 01:18:29,392
Loki!?

981
01:18:31,470 --> 01:18:33,165
Tony, what's going on?

982
01:18:33,650 --> 01:18:35,798
Tell me you found that cube.

983
01:18:37,697 --> 01:18:39,759
Oh, you gotta be shitting me.

984
01:18:43,603 --> 01:18:46,002
I have eyes on Loki. 14th floor.

985
01:18:46,112 --> 01:18:47,424
I'm not Loki.

986
01:18:50,793 --> 01:18:52,777
And I don't wanna hurt you.

987
01:19:01,605 --> 01:19:02,886
I can do this all day.

988
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:05,293
Yeah, I know. I know.

989
01:19:37,798 --> 01:19:39,657
Where did you get this?

990
01:19:50,184 --> 01:19:53,750
Bucky... is... alive!

991
01:19:56,593 --> 01:19:57,593
What?

992
01:20:12,589 --> 01:20:14,682
That is America's ass.

993
01:20:18,706 --> 01:20:21,612
- Please, please!
- I'm sorry. I can't help you, Bruce.

994
01:20:22,511 --> 01:20:26,135
If I give up the Time Stone to help
your reality, I'm dooming my own.

995
01:20:26,183 --> 01:20:31,034
With all due respect, I'm not sure
the science really supports that.

996
01:20:36,655 --> 01:20:40,795
The Infinity Stones create what you
experience as the flow of time.

997
01:20:41,034 --> 01:20:44,753
Remove one of the stones,
and that flow splits.

998
01:20:45,011 --> 01:20:50,073
Now this may benefit your reality.
But my new one, not so much.

999
01:20:50,113 --> 01:20:55,355
In this new branched reality, without our
chief weapon against the forces of darkness,

1000
01:20:55,578 --> 01:20:59,453
our world will be overrun.
Millions will suffer.

1001
01:20:59,570 --> 01:21:03,663
So, tell me, doctor, can your
science prevent all that?

1002
01:21:03,765 --> 01:21:07,061
No. But we can erase it.

1003
01:21:07,085 --> 01:21:10,991
Because once we're done with the stones, we
can return each one into its own timeline

1004
01:21:11,016 --> 01:21:15,374
at the moment it was taken.
So, chronologically...

1005
01:21:16,390 --> 01:21:21,569
In that reality....
it never left.

1006
01:21:23,955 --> 01:21:27,119
Yes, but you're leaving out
the most important part.

1007
01:21:30,564 --> 01:21:33,399
In order to return the
stones, you have to survive.

1008
01:21:33,446 --> 01:21:36,259
We will. I will. I promise.

1009
01:21:36,916 --> 01:21:39,667
I can't risk this
reality on a promise.

1010
01:21:40,003 --> 01:21:44,784
It's the duty, of the Sorcerer
Supreme to protect the Time Stone.

1011
01:21:45,519 --> 01:21:48,378
Then why the hell did
Strange give it away?

1012
01:21:49,175 --> 01:21:51,393
- What did you say?
- Strange. He gave it away.

1013
01:21:51,432 --> 01:21:53,214
He gave it to Thanos.

1014
01:21:53,494 --> 01:21:55,385
- Willingly?
- Yes.

1015
01:21:59,138 --> 01:22:02,310
- Why?
- I have no idea. Maybe he made a mistake.

1016
01:22:12,763 --> 01:22:14,044
Or I did.

1017
01:22:34,171 --> 01:22:36,858
Strange was meant to
be the best of us.

1018
01:22:36,882 --> 01:22:39,749
So he must've done
it for a reason.

1019
01:22:40,146 --> 01:22:42,489
I fear you might be right.

1020
01:22:46,599 --> 01:22:47,833
Thank you.

1021
01:22:54,003 --> 01:22:55,917
I'm counting on you, Bruce.

1022
01:22:57,855 --> 01:22:59,213
We all are.

1023
01:23:19,352 --> 01:23:20,923
Run diagnostics.

1024
01:23:21,751 --> 01:23:23,587
Show me her memory file.

1025
01:23:25,321 --> 01:23:27,844
Sire, the file appears entangled.

1026
01:23:28,993 --> 01:23:31,274
It was a memory, but not hers.

1027
01:23:32,094 --> 01:23:35,203
There's another consciousness
sharing her network.

1028
01:23:35,539 --> 01:23:36,953
Another Nebula.

1029
01:23:39,094 --> 01:23:40,383
Impossible.

1030
01:23:40,836 --> 01:23:46,242
This duplicate carries a time stamp...
from nine years in the future.

1031
01:23:51,011 --> 01:23:53,065
Where is this other Nebula?

1032
01:23:53,964 --> 01:23:56,729
In our solar system.
On Morag.

1033
01:23:57,644 --> 01:24:01,183
- Can you access her?
- Yes. The two are linked.

1034
01:24:01,214 --> 01:24:05,628
Search the duplicate's
memories, for Infinity Stones.

1035
01:24:09,273 --> 01:24:12,422
And these stones have been in a lot of
different places throughout history.

1036
01:24:12,438 --> 01:24:16,445
Our history. So, not a lot of
convenient spots to just drop in.

1037
01:24:16,469 --> 01:24:19,281
- Which means we have to pick our targets.
- Correct.

1038
01:24:19,306 --> 01:24:20,641
Freeze image.

1039
01:24:22,329 --> 01:24:23,657
Terrans.

1040
01:24:24,414 --> 01:24:26,118
Avengers.

1041
01:24:27,204 --> 01:24:31,368
Unruly wretches. What's
that reflection?

1042
01:24:32,196 --> 01:24:34,751
Amplify this, Maw.

1043
01:24:36,743 --> 01:24:38,399
I don't understand.

1044
01:24:42,805 --> 01:24:47,289
- Two Nebulas.
- No. The same Nebula.

1045
01:24:47,733 --> 01:24:49,616
From two different times.

1046
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:54,771
Set course for Morag. Scan
the duplicate's memories.

1047
01:24:55,670 --> 01:24:58,209
I want to see everything.

1048
01:25:07,922 --> 01:25:09,908
My ladies, I'll see you after.
Go on.

1049
01:25:25,748 --> 01:25:28,263
- What are you doing?
- Ahh!

1050
01:25:29,677 --> 01:25:32,318
You're better off leaving the
sneaking to your brother.

1051
01:25:32,350 --> 01:25:34,584
Yeah, I was simply just
going for a walk, and uh...

1052
01:25:34,608 --> 01:25:36,007
What are you wearing?

1053
01:25:36,032 --> 01:25:38,373
I always wear this. This
is one of my favorites.

1054
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:43,900
What's wrong with your eye?

1055
01:25:43,925 --> 01:25:47,073
Oh, my eye. That's... you
remember the Battle of Haroquin?

1056
01:25:47,089 --> 01:25:50,276
When I got hit in the
face with a broadsword?

1057
01:25:53,876 --> 01:25:56,922
You're not the Thor I
know at all, are you?

1058
01:25:56,931 --> 01:25:58,649
Yes, I am.

1059
01:25:58,877 --> 01:26:01,681
The future hasn't been
kind to you, has it?

1060
01:26:01,845 --> 01:26:04,178
I didn't say I'm
from the future.

1061
01:26:04,257 --> 01:26:06,687
I was raised by witches, boy.

1062
01:26:07,593 --> 01:26:10,772
I see with more than
eyes, and you know that.

1063
01:26:12,232 --> 01:26:14,817
I am totally, totally
from the future!

1064
01:26:14,843 --> 01:26:15,883
Yes, you are.

1065
01:26:16,544 --> 01:26:19,349
- I really need to talk to you.
- We can talk.

1066
01:26:43,485 --> 01:26:45,266
His head was over there...

1067
01:26:45,978 --> 01:26:47,642
His body over there...

1068
01:26:49,494 --> 01:26:51,734
What was the point.
I was too late.

1069
01:26:52,789 --> 01:26:54,366
I was just standing there.

1070
01:26:55,687 --> 01:26:58,640
- Some idiot with an ax.
- You're no idiot.

1071
01:27:00,102 --> 01:27:04,609
You're here aren't you? Seeking counsel
from the wisest person in Asgard.

1072
01:27:04,906 --> 01:27:07,469
- I guess, yeah.
- Idiot? No.

1073
01:27:07,586 --> 01:27:11,765
- A failure? Absolutely.
- That's a little bit harsh.

1074
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:14,515
You do know what
that makes you?

1075
01:27:14,666 --> 01:27:16,977
Just like everyone else.

1076
01:27:17,118 --> 01:27:20,157
I'm not supposed to be
like everyone else, am I?

1077
01:27:20,516 --> 01:27:23,828
Everyone fails at who they
are supposed to be, Thor.

1078
01:27:24,504 --> 01:27:27,609
The measure of a
person, of a hero

1079
01:27:27,693 --> 01:27:31,052
is how well they succeed
at being who they are.

1080
01:27:36,230 --> 01:27:38,050
I really missed you, Mum.

1081
01:27:43,705 --> 01:27:45,665
Thor! I got it!

1082
01:27:46,219 --> 01:27:47,992
Get that rabbit!

1083
01:27:50,751 --> 01:27:54,149
- Ma, I have to tell you something.
- No, son. You don't.

1084
01:27:54,549 --> 01:27:57,376
You're here to repair
your future, not mine.

1085
01:27:57,408 --> 01:28:01,173
- But this is about your future.
- It's none of my business.

1086
01:28:04,494 --> 01:28:05,494
Hey.

1087
01:28:05,649 --> 01:28:07,180
You must be Mom.

1088
01:28:07,985 --> 01:28:09,929
I got the thing. Come
on, we got to move.

1089
01:28:09,954 --> 01:28:13,446
- I wish we had more time.
- This was a gift.

1090
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:16,226
And you're going to be the
man you're meant to be.

1091
01:28:17,273 --> 01:28:20,218
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you.

1092
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:24,991
And eat a salad.

1093
01:28:26,562 --> 01:28:28,405
- Come on. We gotta go.
- Goodbye.

1094
01:28:28,421 --> 01:28:31,202
- Three... two...
- No, wait!

1095
01:28:34,218 --> 01:28:35,350
Wh- what am I looking at?

1096
01:28:35,375 --> 01:28:37,694
Oh, sometimes it takes a second.

1097
01:28:46,695 --> 01:28:48,195
I'm still worthy.

1098
01:28:49,586 --> 01:28:50,859
Oh, boy.

1099
01:28:52,437 --> 01:28:54,421
Goodbye, Mom.

1100
01:29:33,564 --> 01:29:35,056
So he's an idiot?

1101
01:29:46,446 --> 01:29:47,633
What's that?

1102
01:29:47,673 --> 01:29:49,289
The tool of a thief.

1103
01:29:57,383 --> 01:29:58,916
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa...

1104
01:29:59,386 --> 01:30:03,090
This is the part where spikes come out,
with skeletons on the end and everything...

1105
01:30:03,115 --> 01:30:04,028
What are you talking about?

1106
01:30:04,053 --> 01:30:06,679
When you break into a place called
the temple of the Power Stone,

1107
01:30:06,704 --> 01:30:10,516
There's gonna be a bunch of booby
traps--- Okay. All right. Go ahead.

1108
01:30:43,663 --> 01:30:45,436
I wasn't always like this.

1109
01:30:46,339 --> 01:30:47,545
Me either.

1110
01:30:48,870 --> 01:30:51,077
But we work with
what we got, right?

1111
01:30:54,303 --> 01:30:55,405
Sync up.

1112
01:30:57,608 --> 01:31:00,022
Three.. two.. one...

1113
01:31:12,947 --> 01:31:14,423
You murdered trillions!

1114
01:31:14,448 --> 01:31:16,183
You should be grateful.

1115
01:31:17,847 --> 01:31:20,855
- Where are the stones?
- Gone.

1116
01:31:21,245 --> 01:31:24,925
- Reduced to atoms.
- You used them two days ago.

1117
01:31:25,015 --> 01:31:30,006
I used the stones to destroy the stones.
It nearly killed me.

1118
01:31:30,163 --> 01:31:34,225
But the work is done.
It always will be.

1119
01:31:35,405 --> 01:31:39,186
I am inevitable.

1120
01:31:40,163 --> 01:31:46,030
- What did you do to them?
- Nothing. Yet.

1121
01:31:47,278 --> 01:31:51,160
They're not trying to stop something
I'm going to do in our time.

1122
01:31:51,635 --> 01:31:55,174
They're trying to undo something
I've already done in theirs.

1123
01:31:55,424 --> 01:31:56,978
The stones...

1124
01:31:57,923 --> 01:31:59,720
I found them all.

1125
01:32:01,406 --> 01:32:02,656
I won.

1126
01:32:03,719 --> 01:32:06,691
Tipped the cosmic
scales to balance.

1127
01:32:10,847 --> 01:32:12,253
This is your future.

1128
01:32:12,816 --> 01:32:14,300
It's my destiny.

1129
01:32:16,042 --> 01:32:20,018
My father is many things. A
liar is not one of them.

1130
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:25,045
Thank you, Daughter.

1131
01:32:25,404 --> 01:32:28,498
Perhaps I treated
you too harshly...

1132
01:32:32,501 --> 01:32:35,267
And that, is destiny fulfilled.

1133
01:32:35,978 --> 01:32:39,267
Sire, your Daughter...

1134
01:32:40,875 --> 01:32:41,875
No...

1135
01:32:42,328 --> 01:32:43,616
...is a traitor.

1136
01:32:43,641 --> 01:32:48,297
That's not me. It's not. I could never...
I would never betray you. Never.

1137
01:32:55,350 --> 01:32:56,560
I know.

1138
01:32:57,387 --> 01:33:00,106
And you'll have the
chance to prove it.

1139
01:33:06,993 --> 01:33:07,993
No...

1140
01:33:08,555 --> 01:33:09,883
He knows!

1141
01:33:14,164 --> 01:33:16,921
Barton? Barton, come in.

1142
01:33:16,984 --> 01:33:21,210
Romanoff? Come in, we have a problem.
Come on!

1143
01:33:21,610 --> 01:33:22,992
Come in, we have a prob....

1144
01:33:23,219 --> 01:33:25,070
Thanos knows.

1145
01:33:25,180 --> 01:33:26,485
Thanos...

1146
01:33:40,527 --> 01:33:41,527
Cap...

1147
01:33:43,113 --> 01:33:45,179
Sorry, buddy.
We got a problem.

1148
01:33:45,222 --> 01:33:47,714
Huh. Yeah, we do.

1149
01:33:47,980 --> 01:33:50,261
- Well, what are we gonna do now?
- You know what, give me a break, Steve.

1150
01:33:50,286 --> 01:33:51,973
I just got hit in the
head with a Hulk.

1151
01:33:52,107 --> 01:33:55,051
You said that we had one shot.
This, this was our shot.

1152
01:33:55,076 --> 01:33:57,743
We shot it. It's shot. Six stones or nothing.
Six stones or nothing.

1153
01:33:57,768 --> 01:33:59,853
You're repeating yourself, you know that?
You're repeating yourself.

1154
01:33:59,878 --> 01:34:01,658
You're repeating yourself.
You're repeating yourself.

1155
01:34:01,683 --> 01:34:02,566
- No!
- Come on.

1156
01:34:02,591 --> 01:34:04,887
You never wanted a time heist, you
went on board with the time heist...

1157
01:34:04,912 --> 01:34:06,278
- I dropped the ball.
- You ruined the time heist.

1158
01:34:06,303 --> 01:34:07,519
- Is that what I did?
- Yeah!

1159
01:34:07,544 --> 01:34:09,456
Are there any other options
with the Tesseract?

1160
01:34:09,465 --> 01:34:11,199
No, no, no. There's
no other options.

1161
01:34:11,246 --> 01:34:13,371
There's no do-overs. We're
not going anywhere else.

1162
01:34:13,402 --> 01:34:15,846
We have one particle left. Each.

1163
01:34:15,871 --> 01:34:19,535
That's it, alright? We use that...
Bye, bye. You're not going home.

1164
01:34:19,578 --> 01:34:21,766
Yeah, well if we don't try...

1165
01:34:21,823 --> 01:34:23,610
then no one else is
going home, either.

1166
01:34:23,635 --> 01:34:24,790
I got it.

1167
01:34:25,188 --> 01:34:29,547
There's another way. To retake the
Tesseract and acquire new particles.

1168
01:34:30,321 --> 01:34:34,118
We'll stroll down memory lane.
Military installation, Garden State.

1169
01:34:37,789 --> 01:34:39,179
  Why were they both there?

1170
01:34:39,204 --> 01:34:42,414
They were there at a...I've
a vaguely exact idea.

1171
01:34:42,438 --> 01:34:43,234
How vague?

1172
01:34:43,290 --> 01:34:44,688
What are you talking about?
Where are we going?

1173
01:34:44,713 --> 01:34:45,916
- I know for a fact they were there...
- Who's they?

1174
01:34:45,939 --> 01:34:48,664
- What are we doing?
- And I know how I know.

1175
01:34:49,562 --> 01:34:51,624
Guys, what's up? What is it?

1176
01:34:51,789 --> 01:34:53,576
Well, it looks like
we're improvising.

1177
01:34:53,601 --> 01:34:55,099
- Right.
- What are we improvising?

1178
01:34:55,124 --> 01:34:57,218
Scott, get this back
to the compound.

1179
01:34:57,243 --> 01:34:57,953
Suit up.

1180
01:34:57,985 --> 01:34:59,132
What's in New Jersey?

1181
01:34:59,157 --> 01:35:01,031
- 0-4, 0-4...
- Uhh, 0-7.

1182
01:35:01,056 --> 01:35:02,125
- 0-7.
- Excuse me...

1183
01:35:02,150 --> 01:35:03,634
1-9-7-0.

1184
01:35:04,189 --> 01:35:08,540
- Are you sure?
- Cap. Captain. Steve, sorry.

1185
01:35:08,904 --> 01:35:11,802
America. Rogers. Look,
if you do this,

1186
01:35:11,837 --> 01:35:14,852
and this doesn't work,
you're not coming back.

1187
01:35:15,696 --> 01:35:17,896
Thanks for the pep
talk, pissant.

1188
01:35:18,509 --> 01:35:19,774
You trust me?

1189
01:35:20,289 --> 01:35:21,415
I do.

1190
01:35:22,892 --> 01:35:24,149
Your call.

1191
01:35:25,063 --> 01:35:26,438
Here we go.

1192
01:35:42,579 --> 01:35:44,025
Hey, man!

1193
01:35:44,325 --> 01:35:45,855
Make love, not war!

1194
01:35:52,534 --> 01:35:55,176
Clearly, you weren't
actually born here, right?

1195
01:35:55,201 --> 01:35:56,815
The idea of me was.

1196
01:35:57,565 --> 01:36:00,127
Right. Well, imagine
you're SHIELD, running a

1197
01:36:00,152 --> 01:36:03,041
quasi-fascistic
intelligence organization.

1198
01:36:04,089 --> 01:36:05,228
Where do you hide it?

1199
01:36:05,688 --> 01:36:06,901
In plain sight.

1200
01:36:35,873 --> 01:36:37,347
Good luck on your
mission, Captain.

1201
01:36:37,372 --> 01:36:39,615
Good luck on your
project, doctor.

1202
01:36:43,272 --> 01:36:44,615
You're new here?

1203
01:36:46,834 --> 01:36:48,037
Not exactly.

1204
01:37:03,508 --> 01:37:04,718
Gotcha.

1205
01:37:22,525 --> 01:37:23,908
Back in the game.

1206
01:37:26,916 --> 01:37:28,674
Arnim, you in there?

1207
01:37:28,986 --> 01:37:30,134
Arnim?

1208
01:37:35,361 --> 01:37:36,361
Hey!

1209
01:37:36,736 --> 01:37:38,657
The door's this way, pal.

1210
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:40,775
Oh, yeah.

1211
01:37:41,042 --> 01:37:42,814
I'm looking for Dr. Zola.
Have you seen him?

1212
01:37:42,839 --> 01:37:46,674
Yeah, no, Dr. Zol... No,
I haven't seen a soul.

1213
01:37:47,903 --> 01:37:49,090
Pardon me.

1214
01:37:50,004 --> 01:37:51,504
Do I know you?

1215
01:37:52,949 --> 01:37:54,995
No, sir. I'm, a...

1216
01:37:55,418 --> 01:37:56,910
visitor from MIT.

1217
01:37:57,050 --> 01:37:58,769
Huh. MIT.

1218
01:37:59,378 --> 01:38:00,683
Got a name?

1219
01:38:01,074 --> 01:38:02,137
Howard.

1220
01:38:02,162 --> 01:38:03,777
Well that'll be
easy to remember.

1221
01:38:03,793 --> 01:38:05,269
Howard...

1222
01:38:05,933 --> 01:38:07,144
...Potts.

1223
01:38:07,169 --> 01:38:09,128
Well, I'm Howard Stark.

1224
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:10,597
Hi.

1225
01:38:10,605 --> 01:38:11,940
Shit. Now, don't pull it.

1226
01:38:11,996 --> 01:38:12,996
Yeah...

1227
01:38:14,706 --> 01:38:16,855
You look a little green around
the gills there, Potts.

1228
01:38:16,910 --> 01:38:18,784
I'm fine. Just, long hours.

1229
01:38:19,316 --> 01:38:21,011
Wanna get some air?

1230
01:38:23,519 --> 01:38:26,261
- Hello, Potts.
- Yeah. That would be swell.

1231
01:38:26,331 --> 01:38:27,714
- That way.
- Okay.

1232
01:38:27,933 --> 01:38:29,511
Need your briefcase?

1233
01:38:34,261 --> 01:38:36,620
You're not one of
those, are ya, Potts?

1234
01:38:42,471 --> 01:38:44,213
- Hello.
- Dr. Pym?

1235
01:38:44,238 --> 01:38:46,879
That would be the number
that you called. Yes.

1236
01:38:46,904 --> 01:38:49,301
This is Capt. Stevens
from shipping.

1237
01:38:49,326 --> 01:38:51,878
- We have a package for you.
- Bring it up.

1238
01:38:51,903 --> 01:38:54,317
Well, that's the thing, sir.
We can't.

1239
01:38:55,183 --> 01:38:57,808
I'm confused. I thought
that was your job.

1240
01:38:57,956 --> 01:39:01,237
Well, it's just... Sir,
the box is glowing and,

1241
01:39:01,262 --> 01:39:03,949
to be honest, some of our mail
guys aren't feeling that great.

1242
01:39:03,974 --> 01:39:05,722
They didn't know
better, did they?

1243
01:39:05,747 --> 01:39:08,332
Yeah, they did. You
better get down here.

1244
01:39:08,927 --> 01:39:11,458
Excuse me. Out of the way!

1245
01:39:38,029 --> 01:39:41,474
So, flowers and sauerkraut. You
got a big date tonight?

1246
01:39:42,158 --> 01:39:43,822
My wife's expecting.

1247
01:39:44,096 --> 01:39:46,690
And, uh... Too much
time in the office.

1248
01:39:48,596 --> 01:39:50,930
- Congratulations.
- Thanks. Hold this, will you?

1249
01:39:50,955 --> 01:39:52,564
Yeah, sure.

1250
01:39:53,326 --> 01:39:55,623
- How far along is she?
- I don't know... uh...

1251
01:39:57,222 --> 01:40:00,261
She's at the point where she can't
stand the sound of my chewing.

1252
01:40:00,331 --> 01:40:03,323
I guess I'll be eating
dinner in the pantry again.

1253
01:40:04,337 --> 01:40:05,675
I have a little girl.

1254
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:09,520
A girl would be nice. Less of a chance
she'd turn out exactly like me.

1255
01:40:10,068 --> 01:40:11,643
What'd be so awful about that?

1256
01:40:11,668 --> 01:40:14,997
Let's just say that the greater
good has rarely outweighed

1257
01:40:15,753 --> 01:40:17,940
my own self-interests.

1258
01:40:20,839 --> 01:40:23,229
- And you've never seen these 2 men before?
- No, I've got an eye for this.

1259
01:40:23,254 --> 01:40:25,146
- The 2 of them looked fishy.
- Can you describe them?

1260
01:40:25,171 --> 01:40:28,522
- Well, one of them had a hippie beard.
- Hippie? Like Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?

1261
01:40:28,547 --> 01:40:29,611
Definitely Mungo Jerry.

1262
01:40:29,636 --> 01:40:31,815
Yeah, this is Chesler. I
need every available MPs

1263
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:34,089
on sub-level 6. We have
a potential breach.

1264
01:41:35,882 --> 01:41:37,584
So, where are you
at with names?

1265
01:41:37,609 --> 01:41:40,663
Well, if it's a boy,
my wife likes Almanzo.

1266
01:41:41,609 --> 01:41:43,889
Might wanna let that stew on.
You got time.

1267
01:41:45,719 --> 01:41:47,699
Let me ask you a question.

1268
01:41:48,153 --> 01:41:50,317
When your kid was born...

1269
01:41:50,603 --> 01:41:53,668
- were you nervous?
- Wildly. Yeah.

1270
01:41:53,692 --> 01:41:55,074
Did you feel qualified?

1271
01:41:55,099 --> 01:41:58,652
Like you had any idea how to
successfully operate that thing?

1272
01:41:58,845 --> 01:42:01,923
I literally pieced it
together as I went along,

1273
01:42:01,978 --> 01:42:04,579
I thought about what
my Dad did, and...

1274
01:42:04,782 --> 01:42:07,680
My old man, he never met a problem
he couldn't solve with a belt.

1275
01:42:07,805 --> 01:42:09,899
I thought my Dad
was tough on me.

1276
01:42:09,942 --> 01:42:12,929
And now, looking back, I just
remember the good stuff, you know.

1277
01:42:12,985 --> 01:42:16,116
- He did drop the odd pearl.
- Yeah? Like what?

1278
01:42:17,026 --> 01:42:19,776
"No amount of money ever
bought a second of time."

1279
01:42:20,839 --> 01:42:22,230
Smart guy.

1280
01:42:22,254 --> 01:42:23,674
He did his best.

1281
01:42:25,111 --> 01:42:26,877
Let me tell you. That
kid's not even here yet

1282
01:42:26,902 --> 01:42:29,229
and, there's nothing I
wouldn't do for him.

1283
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:38,957
Good to meet you, Potts.

1284
01:42:39,919 --> 01:42:42,145
Yeah, Howard...

1285
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:45,047
Everything's gonna be all right.

1286
01:42:47,252 --> 01:42:50,760
Thank you for everything...

1287
01:42:51,018 --> 01:42:53,603
...you've done for
this country.

1288
01:42:56,361 --> 01:42:57,525
Jarvis.

1289
01:43:01,221 --> 01:43:02,891
Have we ever met that guy?

1290
01:43:05,174 --> 01:43:06,619


1291
01:43:09,143 --> 01:43:10,970
Seems very familiar.

1292
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:13,306
Weird beard, though.

1293
01:43:21,436 --> 01:43:24,172
- You're weak.
- I'm you.

1294
01:43:41,612 --> 01:43:43,072
You can stop this.

1295
01:43:43,822 --> 01:43:45,627
You know you want to.

1296
01:43:46,697 --> 01:43:49,297
Did you see what
happens in the future?

1297
01:43:49,971 --> 01:43:52,455
Thanos finds the Soul Stone.

1298
01:43:53,869 --> 01:43:56,002
You wanna know
how he does that?

1299
01:43:57,096 --> 01:44:01,853
You wanna know, what
he does to you?

1300
01:44:02,001 --> 01:44:03,369
That's enough.

1301
01:44:15,498 --> 01:44:16,943
You disgust me.

1302
01:44:18,404 --> 01:44:23,052
But, that doesn't
mean you're useless.

1303
01:44:45,128 --> 01:44:46,667
How do I look?

1304
01:44:53,418 --> 01:44:54,418
Wow...

1305
01:44:55,222 --> 01:44:57,565
Under different circumstances,

1306
01:44:58,422 --> 01:45:00,659
this would be totally awesome.

1307
01:45:12,576 --> 01:45:15,701
I bet the raccoon didn't
have to climb a mountain.

1308
01:45:15,832 --> 01:45:17,816
Technically, he's not
a raccoon, you know.

1309
01:45:17,841 --> 01:45:19,459
Whatever. He eats garbage.

1310
01:45:19,753 --> 01:45:20,753
Welcome.

1311
01:45:24,105 --> 01:45:26,823
Natasha, daughter of Ivan.

1312
01:45:27,822 --> 01:45:30,752
Clint, son of Edith.

1313
01:45:36,935 --> 01:45:38,051
Who are you?

1314
01:45:39,067 --> 01:45:41,262
Consider me a guide.

1315
01:45:41,603 --> 01:45:45,208
To you, and to all who
seek the Soul Stone.

1316
01:45:45,314 --> 01:45:48,743
Okay. You tell us where it is.
Then we'll be on our way.

1317
01:45:52,509 --> 01:45:54,461
If only it were that easy.

1318
01:46:06,985 --> 01:46:09,907
What you seek lies
in front of you...

1319
01:46:11,915 --> 01:46:13,735
...as does what you fear.

1320
01:46:19,410 --> 01:46:21,010
The stone is down there.

1321
01:46:21,801 --> 01:46:22,957
For one of you.

1322
01:46:24,145 --> 01:46:25,340
For the other...

1323
01:46:28,348 --> 01:46:32,801
In order to take the stone, you
must lose that which you love.

1324
01:46:34,768 --> 01:46:36,948
An everlasting exchange.

1325
01:46:39,018 --> 01:46:42,041
A soul, for a soul.

1326
01:46:45,518 --> 01:46:46,924
How's it going?

1327
01:46:50,557 --> 01:46:51,557
Jesus...

1328
01:46:52,197 --> 01:46:54,338
Maybe he's making this shit up.

1329
01:46:54,565 --> 01:46:57,971
No. I don't think so.

1330
01:46:58,760 --> 01:47:00,807
Why, 'cause he knows
your Daddy's name?

1331
01:47:02,448 --> 01:47:03,564
I didn't.

1332
01:47:04,759 --> 01:47:06,885
Thanos left here with the stone

1333
01:47:07,979 --> 01:47:11,463
without his daughter.
It's not a coincidence.

1334
01:47:12,854 --> 01:47:13,854
Yeah.

1335
01:47:15,908 --> 01:47:17,979
Whatever it takes.

1336
01:47:22,518 --> 01:47:23,799
Whatever it takes.

1337
01:47:28,322 --> 01:47:32,268
If we don't get that stone,
billions of people stay dead.

1338
01:47:35,998 --> 01:47:38,544
Then I guess we both
know who it's gotta be.

1339
01:47:38,905 --> 01:47:40,357
I guess we do.

1340
01:47:48,635 --> 01:47:53,057
I'm starting to think, we've been
different people here, Natasha.

1341
01:47:53,471 --> 01:47:56,877
For the last five years I've been trying
to do one thing: Get to right here.

1342
01:47:56,955 --> 01:47:59,228
That's all it's been about.
Bringing everybody back.

1343
01:47:59,253 --> 01:48:03,799
- Oh, don't you get all decent on me now.
- What, you think I wanna do it?

1344
01:48:04,206 --> 01:48:06,210
I'm trying to save
your life, you idiot.

1345
01:48:06,235 --> 01:48:08,382
Yeah well, I don't want
you to, because I...

1346
01:48:09,373 --> 01:48:11,573
Natasha, you know
what I've done.

1347
01:48:13,045 --> 01:48:15,310
You know what I've become.

1348
01:48:17,115 --> 01:48:19,794
I don't judge people on
their worst mistakes.

1349
01:48:23,982 --> 01:48:25,318
Maybe you should.

1350
01:48:26,193 --> 01:48:27,287
You didn't.

1351
01:48:33,687 --> 01:48:36,108
You're a pain in my
ass, you know that?

1352
01:48:46,992 --> 01:48:48,132
Okay.

1353
01:48:50,117 --> 01:48:51,351
You win.

1354
01:48:58,010 --> 01:48:59,810
Tell my family I love them.

1355
01:49:02,773 --> 01:49:04,328
You tell them yourself.

1356
01:49:37,081 --> 01:49:38,206
Damn you!

1357
01:49:54,412 --> 01:49:55,655
Let me go.

1358
01:49:57,550 --> 01:49:58,550
No.

1359
01:50:00,611 --> 01:50:01,737
Please, no.

1360
01:50:04,633 --> 01:50:06,226
It's okay.

1361
01:50:08,913 --> 01:50:09,949
Please...

1362
01:51:53,846 --> 01:51:55,143
Did we get them all?

1363
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:58,158
You telling me this'll
actually work?

1364
01:52:02,875 --> 01:52:04,437
Clint, where's Nat?

1365
01:52:33,622 --> 01:52:35,555
Do we know if she had family?

1366
01:52:35,654 --> 01:52:37,818
Yeah. Us.

1367
01:52:39,388 --> 01:52:40,536
What?

1368
01:52:42,810 --> 01:52:44,091
I just asked him a question...

1369
01:52:44,116 --> 01:52:46,239
Yeah, you're acting like she's dead.
Why are we acting like she's dead?

1370
01:52:46,264 --> 01:52:48,171
We have the stones, right?
As long as we have

1371
01:52:48,196 --> 01:52:50,530
the stones, Cap, we can bring
her back, isn't that right?

1372
01:52:50,555 --> 01:52:52,898
So stop this shit. We're the
Avengers, get it together.

1373
01:52:52,923 --> 01:52:54,733
We can't get her back.

1374
01:52:57,460 --> 01:53:01,524
- Wha- what?
- It can't be undone. It can't.

1375
01:53:04,128 --> 01:53:07,990
I'm sorry. No offense, but you're
a very earthly being. Okay?

1376
01:53:08,015 --> 01:53:11,406
We're talking about space magic.
And "can't" seems very () don't you think?

1377
01:53:11,437 --> 01:53:14,437
Look, I know that I'm way
outside my paygrade here.

1378
01:53:14,445 --> 01:53:16,007
But she still isn't
here, is she?

1379
01:53:16,032 --> 01:53:19,960
- Now that's my point.
- It can't be undone.

1380
01:53:20,468 --> 01:53:23,819
Or that's at least what the,
great floating guy had to say.

1381
01:53:23,843 --> 01:53:25,490
Maybe you wanna go talk to him?
Okay?

1382
01:53:25,515 --> 01:53:28,952
Go grab your hammer, and you
go fly and you talk to him.

1383
01:53:36,963 --> 01:53:38,962
It was supposed to be me.

1384
01:53:41,619 --> 01:53:45,666
She sacrificed her life for that
goddamned stone. She bet her life on it.

1385
01:53:50,216 --> 01:53:52,122
She's not coming back.

1386
01:53:54,442 --> 01:53:57,270
We have to make it worth it.
We have to.

1387
01:53:59,299 --> 01:54:00,416
We will.

1388
01:54:25,678 --> 01:54:26,756
Boom!

1389
01:54:32,264 --> 01:54:34,201
All right. The glove's ready.

1390
01:54:34,638 --> 01:54:37,372
Question is, who's gonna
snap their freaking fingers?

1391
01:54:37,785 --> 01:54:38,785
I'll do it.

1392
01:54:39,372 --> 01:54:40,372
It's okay.

1393
01:54:40,396 --> 01:54:42,169
- No, no, no, no. Stop. Stop.
- Hey, hey...

1394
01:54:42,185 --> 01:54:43,161
Thor, just wait.

1395
01:54:43,186 --> 01:54:45,396
We haven't decided who's
gonna put that on yet.

1396
01:54:45,889 --> 01:54:48,795
I'm sorry. What, were you just sitting
around waiting for the right opportunity?

1397
01:54:48,842 --> 01:54:50,154
We should at least discuss it.

1398
01:54:50,163 --> 01:54:54,006
Look, us sitting here staring at that
thing is not gonna bring everybody back.

1399
01:54:55,034 --> 01:54:58,209
I'm the strongest Avenger, okay? So
this responsibility falls upon me.

1400
01:54:58,234 --> 01:55:03,398
It's my duty. It's not that... It's...
stop it! Just let me.

1401
01:55:05,896 --> 01:55:09,552
Just let me do it. Just
let me do something good.

1402
01:55:09,577 --> 01:55:10,396
- Something great.
- Look...

1403
01:55:10,412 --> 01:55:12,349
It's not just the fact that
that glove is channeling

1404
01:55:12,374 --> 01:55:15,076
enough energy to light up a
continent, I'm telling you

1405
01:55:15,100 --> 01:55:16,100
you're in no condition.

1406
01:55:16,139 --> 01:55:19,428
What do you think is coursing
through my veins right now?

1407
01:55:19,453 --> 01:55:20,670
Cheez Whiz?

1408
01:55:23,352 --> 01:55:25,021
- Lightning.
- Yeah.

1409
01:55:25,079 --> 01:55:26,992
Lightning won't help you, pal.

1410
01:55:27,056 --> 01:55:28,430
It's gotta be me.

1411
01:55:30,141 --> 01:55:33,625
You saw what those stones did to Thanos.
It almost killed him.

1412
01:55:35,602 --> 01:55:37,422
None of you could survive.

1413
01:55:37,873 --> 01:55:39,818
How do we know you will?

1414
01:55:39,834 --> 01:55:43,584
I don't. But the
radiation's mostly gamma.

1415
01:55:46,980 --> 01:55:48,332
It's like...

1416
01:55:50,636 --> 01:55:52,371
I was meant for this.

1417
01:56:11,401 --> 01:56:13,230
Good to go, yeah?

1418
01:56:14,996 --> 01:56:16,417
Let's do it.

1419
01:56:16,558 --> 01:56:18,635
You remember everyone
Thanos snapped away five

1420
01:56:18,660 --> 01:56:21,496
years ago and just bringing
them back to now, today.

1421
01:56:22,205 --> 01:56:24,595
Don't change anything
from the last five years.

1422
01:56:24,744 --> 01:56:25,744
Got it.

1423
01:56:42,587 --> 01:56:45,360
Friday, do me a favor and
activate protocol 8.

1424
01:56:45,400 --> 01:56:46,547
Yes, boss.

1425
01:56:55,212 --> 01:56:56,852
Everybody comes home.

1426
01:57:20,230 --> 01:57:23,597
- Take it off. Take it off!
- No, wait. Bruce, are you okay?

1427
01:57:24,222 --> 01:57:25,565
Talk to me, Banner.

1428
01:57:29,129 --> 01:57:31,629
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1429
01:58:03,068 --> 01:58:04,089
Bruce!

1430
01:58:05,565 --> 01:58:07,277
Don't move him.

1431
01:58:14,360 --> 01:58:17,133
- Did it work?
- Worth a shot. It's over. It's okay.

1432
01:59:02,676 --> 01:59:03,621
Honey.

1433
01:59:04,864 --> 01:59:05,864
Honey.

1434
01:59:07,169 --> 01:59:08,169
Guys...

1435
01:59:10,968 --> 01:59:12,686
I think it worked!

1436
01:59:54,082 --> 01:59:56,378
I can't breathe. I can't breathe!
I can't breathe.

1437
01:59:57,604 --> 01:59:59,955
Canopy. Canopy. Canopy.

1438
02:00:06,378 --> 02:00:08,652
Rhodey, Rocket, get outta here!

1439
02:00:09,227 --> 02:00:10,758
Hurry up! Hurry up!

1440
02:00:11,070 --> 02:00:12,165
Come on!

1441
02:00:22,250 --> 02:00:23,640
Rhodey!

1442
02:00:31,829 --> 02:00:35,633
Mayday, mayday! Does anybody copy? We're
in the lower level, it's flooding!

1443
02:00:35,665 --> 02:00:39,198
- What?
- We're drowning! Does anybody copy? Mayday!

1444
02:00:39,317 --> 02:00:43,278
Wait! I'm here! I'm
here, can you hear me?

1445
02:01:02,849 --> 02:01:03,849
Cap?

1446
02:01:48,450 --> 02:01:49,450
Daughter.

1447
02:01:49,513 --> 02:01:50,825
Yes, Father.

1448
02:01:52,755 --> 02:01:56,005
So, this is the future.
Well done.

1449
02:01:56,513 --> 02:02:00,059
Thank you, Father. They
suspected nothing.

1450
02:02:02,146 --> 02:02:04,364
The arrogant never do.

1451
02:02:06,443 --> 02:02:07,443
Go.

1452
02:02:08,403 --> 02:02:10,949
Find the stones.
Bring them to me.

1453
02:02:11,215 --> 02:02:12,606
What will you do?

1454
02:02:14,075 --> 02:02:15,200
Wait.

1455
02:03:11,434 --> 02:03:13,324
Tell me something.

1456
02:03:13,980 --> 02:03:18,362
In the future, what
happens to you and me?

1457
02:03:20,903 --> 02:03:22,379
I tried to kill you.

1458
02:03:24,262 --> 02:03:25,433
Several times.

1459
02:03:26,895 --> 02:03:30,152
But eventually,
we become friends.

1460
02:03:32,387 --> 02:03:34,097
We become sisters.

1461
02:03:41,617 --> 02:03:42,850
Come on.

1462
02:03:44,742 --> 02:03:46,211
We can stop him.

1463
02:03:54,808 --> 02:03:56,408
Come on, buddy. Wake up.

1464
02:03:56,605 --> 02:03:58,003
That's my man.

1465
02:03:59,097 --> 02:04:01,581
You lose this again,
I'm keeping it.

1466
02:04:04,519 --> 02:04:05,886
What happened?

1467
02:04:06,071 --> 02:04:08,219
We messed with time.
It tends to mess back.

1468
02:04:08,244 --> 02:04:09,244
You'll see.

1469
02:04:31,021 --> 02:04:32,872
What's he been doing?

1470
02:04:34,387 --> 02:04:35,973
Absolutely nothing.

1471
02:04:37,677 --> 02:04:39,192
Where are the stones?

1472
02:04:39,715 --> 02:04:41,676
Lost somewhere under all this.

1473
02:04:42,896 --> 02:04:45,200
All I know is he
doesn't have them.

1474
02:04:45,528 --> 02:04:47,121
So we keep it that way.

1475
02:04:47,146 --> 02:04:49,599
- You know it's a trap, right?
- Yeah...

1476
02:04:50,294 --> 02:04:51,770
I don't much care.

1477
02:04:52,333 --> 02:04:53,333
Good.

1478
02:04:54,489 --> 02:04:57,089
Just as long as we're
all in agreement.

1479
02:05:06,755 --> 02:05:09,022
Let's kill him
properly this time.

1480
02:05:18,045 --> 02:05:20,778
You could not live
with your own failure.

1481
02:05:22,498 --> 02:05:24,264
Where did that bring you?

1482
02:05:27,398 --> 02:05:28,719
Back to me.

1483
02:05:32,648 --> 02:05:35,250
I thought by eliminating
half of life,

1484
02:05:36,069 --> 02:05:38,334
the other half would thrive.

1485
02:05:38,702 --> 02:05:43,210
But you've shown me,
that's impossible.

1486
02:05:44,839 --> 02:05:48,222
And as long as there are those
that remember what was,

1487
02:05:48,247 --> 02:05:53,489
there will always be those that
are unable to accept what can be.

1488
02:05:54,184 --> 02:05:55,598
They will resist.

1489
02:05:55,895 --> 02:05:58,095
Yep. We're all
kinds of stubborn.

1490
02:05:58,825 --> 02:06:00,450
I'm thankful.

1491
02:06:02,614 --> 02:06:06,520
Because now, I know
what I must do.

1492
02:06:07,192 --> 02:06:12,449
I will shred this universe
down to its last atom.

1493
02:06:13,231 --> 02:06:14,645
And then...

1494
02:06:14,970 --> 02:06:19,860
With the stones you've collected
for me, create a new one.

1495
02:06:20,392 --> 02:06:22,189
Teeming with life,

1496
02:06:22,550 --> 02:06:27,206
but knows not what it has lost
but only what it has been given.

1497
02:06:29,970 --> 02:06:31,579
A grateful universe.

1498
02:06:32,101 --> 02:06:33,571
Born out of blood.

1499
02:06:33,728 --> 02:06:35,399
They'll never know it.

1500
02:06:36,430 --> 02:06:39,097
Because you won't be
alive to tell them.

1501
02:06:54,327 --> 02:06:55,936
See you on the other side, man.

1502
02:06:57,562 --> 02:06:59,795
Hang on! I'm coming!

1503
02:07:45,712 --> 02:07:47,197
Oh, hey...

1504
02:07:47,252 --> 02:07:48,955
I know you.

1505
02:07:52,189 --> 02:07:55,423
Father. I have the stones.

1506
02:07:55,502 --> 02:07:56,502
What?!

1507
02:07:57,728 --> 02:07:58,837
Stop.

1508
02:08:03,789 --> 02:08:05,609
You're betraying us?

1509
02:08:11,313 --> 02:08:13,180
You don't have to do this.

1510
02:08:15,446 --> 02:08:18,367
I am... this.

1511
02:08:18,399 --> 02:08:20,250
No, you're not.

1512
02:08:20,414 --> 02:08:22,461
You've seen what we become.

1513
02:08:28,504 --> 02:08:29,958
Nebula, listen to her.

1514
02:08:32,310 --> 02:08:33,583
You can change.

1515
02:08:39,761 --> 02:08:41,113
He won't let me.

1516
02:08:42,886 --> 02:08:43,886
No!

1517
02:09:03,132 --> 02:09:05,132
Okay, Thor. Hit me.

1518
02:09:21,093 --> 02:09:22,601
Boss, wake up.

1519
02:10:13,683 --> 02:10:14,917
I knew it!

1520
02:11:37,721 --> 02:11:40,057
In all my years of conquest...

1521
02:11:41,323 --> 02:11:42,565
violence...

1522
02:11:44,276 --> 02:11:45,463
slaughter...

1523
02:11:47,362 --> 02:11:48,995
It was never personal.

1524
02:11:52,433 --> 02:11:54,159
But I'll tell you now...

1525
02:11:56,600 --> 02:11:59,133
what I'm about to do
to your stubborn,

1526
02:11:59,944 --> 02:12:02,170
annoying little planet...

1527
02:12:04,412 --> 02:12:09,216
I'm gonna enjoy it.
Very, very much.

1528
02:13:13,633 --> 02:13:15,140
Cap, you hear me?

1529
02:13:20,629 --> 02:13:22,988
Cap, it's Sam.
Can you hear me?

1530
02:13:27,226 --> 02:13:28,477
On your left.

1531
02:14:54,038 --> 02:14:55,405
Is that everyone?

1532
02:14:55,702 --> 02:14:57,233
What, you wanted more?

1533
02:15:24,336 --> 02:15:25,781
Avengers...

1534
02:15:31,255 --> 02:15:32,512
... assemble.

1535
02:16:29,268 --> 02:16:30,783
No, no. Give me that.

1536
02:16:30,821 --> 02:16:32,393
You have the little one.

1537
02:16:45,921 --> 02:16:46,921
Hey!

1538
02:16:47,835 --> 02:16:48,866
Holy cow.

1539
02:16:48,914 --> 02:16:52,132
You will not believe what's been going on.
Do you remember when we were in space?

1540
02:16:52,157 --> 02:16:55,866
And I got all dusty? I must've passed
out, 'cause I woke up, and you were gone.

1541
02:16:55,891 --> 02:16:57,859
But Doctor Strange was there, right?
He was like,

1542
02:16:57,884 --> 02:16:59,761
"It's been five years.
Come on, they need us!"

1543
02:16:59,786 --> 02:17:02,292
And then he started doing the yellow
sparkly thing that he does all the time...

1544
02:17:02,317 --> 02:17:04,027
What are you doing?

1545
02:17:08,637 --> 02:17:09,793
This is nice.

1546
02:17:31,962 --> 02:17:33,220
Gamora?

1547
02:17:42,229 --> 02:17:43,823
I thought I lost you.

1548
02:17:48,612 --> 02:17:51,346
Don't... touch... me!

1549
02:17:54,501 --> 02:17:56,086
You missed the first time...

1550
02:17:56,657 --> 02:17:59,188
then you got them
both the second time.

1551
02:18:00,783 --> 02:18:03,055
This is the one? Seriously?

1552
02:18:03,124 --> 02:18:05,304
The choices were him, or a tree.

1553
02:18:15,954 --> 02:18:19,273
Cap, what do you want me to
do with this damn thing?

1554
02:18:21,243 --> 02:18:23,602
Get those stones as
far away as possible!

1555
02:18:23,618 --> 02:18:24,735
No!

1556
02:18:25,743 --> 02:18:28,041
We need to get them back
where they came from.

1557
02:18:28,066 --> 02:18:30,705
No way to get them back. Thanos
destroyed the quantum tunnel.

1558
02:18:30,768 --> 02:18:31,869
Hold on!

1559
02:18:33,150 --> 02:18:35,478
That wasn't our
only time machine.

1560
02:18:41,419 --> 02:18:43,662
Anyone see an ugly
brown van up there?

1561
02:18:43,912 --> 02:18:44,692
Yes!

1562
02:18:44,739 --> 02:18:47,004
But you're not gonna
like where it's parked.

1563
02:18:47,029 --> 02:18:50,278
Scott, how long you need
to get that thing working?

1564
02:18:50,653 --> 02:18:51,853
Maybe ten minutes.

1565
02:18:51,857 --> 02:18:53,661
Get it started. We'll
get the stones to you.

1566
02:18:53,686 --> 02:18:55,193
We're on it, Cap.

1567
02:19:04,913 --> 02:19:05,913
Hey.

1568
02:19:06,233 --> 02:19:09,209
You said one out of 14
million, we win, yeah?

1569
02:19:10,255 --> 02:19:11,255
Tell me this is it.

1570
02:19:11,639 --> 02:19:14,904
If I tell you what
happens, it won't happen.

1571
02:19:18,567 --> 02:19:20,129
You better be right.

1572
02:19:27,918 --> 02:19:29,385
It's a mess back here.

1573
02:19:29,794 --> 02:19:32,208
It's... it's dead.

1574
02:19:32,395 --> 02:19:33,855
- What?
- It's dead.

1575
02:19:34,137 --> 02:19:35,762
I have to hotwire it.

1576
02:19:38,434 --> 02:19:39,935
Where's Nebula?

1577
02:19:40,583 --> 02:19:42,455
She's not responding.

1578
02:19:42,531 --> 02:19:43,531
Sire!

1579
02:19:53,536 --> 02:19:54,660
Clint!

1580
02:19:56,897 --> 02:19:58,091
Give it to me.

1581
02:20:20,398 --> 02:20:23,922
You took everything from me.

1582
02:20:24,047 --> 02:20:26,195
I don't even know who you are.

1583
02:20:26,586 --> 02:20:27,812
You will.

1584
02:20:50,361 --> 02:20:51,361
I got it!

1585
02:20:53,994 --> 02:20:55,657
Activate Instant Kill!

1586
02:21:19,052 --> 02:21:20,341
Rain fire!

1587
02:21:20,638 --> 02:21:22,887
But Sire, our troops!

1588
02:21:22,935 --> 02:21:24,192
Just do it!

1589
02:21:45,331 --> 02:21:46,948
Is anyone else seeing this?

1590
02:22:00,791 --> 02:22:01,869
I got this.

1591
02:22:02,072 --> 02:22:03,072
I got this!

1592
02:22:03,127 --> 02:22:04,439
Okay, I don't got this.

1593
02:22:04,447 --> 02:22:07,814
- Help! Somebody, help!
- Hey, Queens. Heads up.

1594
02:22:17,573 --> 02:22:19,440
Hang on. I got you, kid.

1595
02:22:22,361 --> 02:22:23,479
Hey! Nice to meet---

1596
02:22:23,501 --> 02:22:24,580
Oh! My God!

1597
02:23:01,987 --> 02:23:03,409
What the hell is this?

1598
02:23:03,799 --> 02:23:05,188
Friday, what are they firing at?

1599
02:23:05,213 --> 02:23:07,674
Something just entered
the upper atmosphere.

1600
02:23:20,471 --> 02:23:22,034
Oh, yeah!

1601
02:23:42,485 --> 02:23:44,915
Danvers, we need an assist here.

1602
02:23:53,556 --> 02:23:55,923
Hi. I'm Peter Parker.

1603
02:23:56,738 --> 02:23:59,924
Hey, Peter Parker. Got
something for me?

1604
02:24:05,559 --> 02:24:08,871
I don't know how you're
gonna get through all that.

1605
02:24:09,520 --> 02:24:10,699
Don't worry.

1606
02:24:11,676 --> 02:24:13,168
She's got help.

1607
02:27:00,812 --> 02:27:04,139
I am... inevitable.

1608
02:27:24,540 --> 02:27:25,618
And I...

1609
02:27:27,783 --> 02:27:28,993
am...

1610
02:27:32,657 --> 02:27:33,954
... Iron Man.

1611
02:29:32,706 --> 02:29:34,049
Mr. Stark?

1612
02:29:34,924 --> 02:29:35,924
Hey...

1613
02:29:37,080 --> 02:29:40,065
Mr. Stark? Can you hear me?

1614
02:29:40,110 --> 02:29:41,453
It's Peter.

1615
02:29:45,603 --> 02:29:47,063
We won.

1616
02:29:47,439 --> 02:29:48,439
Mr. Stark....

1617
02:29:50,462 --> 02:29:52,446
We won, Mr. Stark.

1618
02:29:53,984 --> 02:29:56,672
We won and you did it, sir.
You did it.

1619
02:29:58,273 --> 02:30:00,609
I'm sorry... Tony...

1620
02:30:14,182 --> 02:30:16,791
- Hey.
- Hey, Pep...

1621
02:30:21,428 --> 02:30:24,974
- Friday?
- Life functions critical.

1622
02:30:34,060 --> 02:30:35,146
Tony.

1623
02:30:36,458 --> 02:30:37,575
Look at me.

1624
02:30:40,099 --> 02:30:41,661
We're gonna be okay.

1625
02:30:46,739 --> 02:30:48,529
You can rest now.

1626
02:32:33,844 --> 02:32:36,383
Everybody wants a
happy ending, right?

1627
02:32:37,039 --> 02:32:39,439
But it doesn't always
roll that way.

1628
02:32:41,211 --> 02:32:42,570
Maybe this time.

1629
02:32:44,492 --> 02:32:47,085
I'm hoping if you
play this back,

1630
02:32:48,679 --> 02:32:50,421
it's in celebration.

1631
02:32:51,296 --> 02:32:53,501
I hope families are reunited,

1632
02:32:53,572 --> 02:32:55,806
I hope we get it back,
and something like a

1633
02:32:55,831 --> 02:32:58,312
normal version of the
planet has been restored.

1634
02:32:59,142 --> 02:33:01,524
If there ever was such a thing.

1635
02:33:01,790 --> 02:33:03,267
God, what a world.

1636
02:33:03,533 --> 02:33:05,243
Universe, now.

1637
02:33:05,900 --> 02:33:08,017
If you told me ten years
ago that we weren't alone,

1638
02:33:08,042 --> 02:33:09,540
let alone, you know,
to this extent,

1639
02:33:09,564 --> 02:33:13,165
I mean, I wouldn't have been surprised.
But come on, you know?

1640
02:33:13,494 --> 02:33:17,994
That epic forces of darkness and
light that have come into play.

1641
02:33:18,525 --> 02:33:20,192
And, for better or worse,

1642
02:33:20,356 --> 02:33:24,106
that's the reality Morgan's gonna
have to find a way to grow up in.

1643
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,382
So I found the time and I
recorded a little greeting...

1644
02:33:30,470 --> 02:33:33,492
In the case of an untimely death.
On my part.

1645
02:33:33,813 --> 02:33:37,329
Not that, death in any
time isn't untimely.

1646
02:33:37,890 --> 02:33:40,278
This time travel thing that we're
gonna try and pull off tomorrow,

1647
02:33:40,303 --> 02:33:42,529
it's, it's got me scratching
my head about this.

1648
02:33:46,969 --> 02:33:50,352
But then again, that's the hero gig.
Part of the journey is the end.

1649
02:33:53,281 --> 02:33:57,437
Everything's gonna work out
exactly the way it's supposed to.

1650
02:34:00,730 --> 02:34:02,238
I love you 3,000.

1651
02:36:17,387 --> 02:36:19,504
You know, I wish
there was a way...

1652
02:36:19,598 --> 02:36:21,410
that I could let her know.

1653
02:36:23,394 --> 02:36:24,793
That we won.

1654
02:36:27,011 --> 02:36:28,253
We did it.

1655
02:36:32,269 --> 02:36:33,346
She knows.

1656
02:36:39,012 --> 02:36:40,291
They both do.

1657
02:36:49,958 --> 02:36:51,425
How you doing, Squirt?

1658
02:36:51,427 --> 02:36:53,513
- Good.
- You good?

1659
02:36:53,638 --> 02:36:56,372
- Okay. You hungry?
- Mm-hmm.

1660
02:36:56,919 --> 02:37:00,121
- What do you want?
- Cheeseburgers.

1661
02:37:04,813 --> 02:37:07,758
You know your Dad
liked cheeseburgers?

1662
02:37:11,313 --> 02:37:13,922
I'm gonna get you all the
cheeseburgers you want.

1663
02:37:13,938 --> 02:37:14,938
Okay.

1664
02:37:31,647 --> 02:37:35,382
So, when can we expect you back?

1665
02:37:37,695 --> 02:37:41,585
- About that...
- Thor. Your people need a king.

1666
02:37:41,700 --> 02:37:43,910
No, they already have one.

1667
02:37:45,731 --> 02:37:47,020
That's funny.

1668
02:37:52,091 --> 02:37:53,551
You're being serious?

1669
02:37:57,638 --> 02:37:59,920
It's time for me to be
who I am rather than

1670
02:38:00,505 --> 02:38:02,762
who I'm supposed to be.

1671
02:38:04,193 --> 02:38:08,098
But you, you're a leader.
That's who you are.

1672
02:38:10,751 --> 02:38:13,032
You know I'd make a lot
of changes around here.

1673
02:38:13,057 --> 02:38:16,236
I'm counting on it.
Your Majesty.

1674
02:38:26,295 --> 02:38:27,631
What will you do?

1675
02:38:28,014 --> 02:38:29,232
I'm not sure.

1676
02:38:29,873 --> 02:38:32,326
For the first time in a
thousand years, I...

1677
02:38:32,498 --> 02:38:35,146
I have no path. I do
have a ride, though.

1678
02:38:35,240 --> 02:38:37,466
Move it or lose it, hairbag.

1679
02:38:41,419 --> 02:38:42,950
Well, here we are.

1680
02:38:43,420 --> 02:38:45,607
Tree! Good to see you.

1681
02:38:47,841 --> 02:38:48,841
Well...

1682
02:38:49,699 --> 02:38:52,529
The As-Guardians of the
Galaxy back together again.

1683
02:38:53,571 --> 02:38:55,076
Where to first?

1684
02:38:58,114 --> 02:39:01,348
Just so you know, this is my ship still.
I'm in charge.

1685
02:39:01,691 --> 02:39:04,246
I know. I know. Of
course, you are.

1686
02:39:04,512 --> 02:39:05,723
Of course.

1687
02:39:08,294 --> 02:39:11,309
See, you say of course, but
then you touch the map.

1688
02:39:11,334 --> 02:39:14,216
It makes you think that maybe you
didn't realize I was in charge.

1689
02:39:14,318 --> 02:39:17,560
Quail, that's your own
insecurities in there. Okay?

1690
02:39:17,576 --> 02:39:19,770
I'm merely trying to be of service.
An assistant.

1691
02:39:19,795 --> 02:39:22,110
- Quill.
- That's what I said.

1692
02:39:22,135 --> 02:39:24,400
You should fight one another
for the honor of leadership.

1693
02:39:24,541 --> 02:39:25,970
Sounds fair.

1694
02:39:28,565 --> 02:39:30,252
- It's not necessary.
- It's not.

1695
02:39:30,268 --> 02:39:30,877
Okay?

1696
02:39:30,902 --> 02:39:33,542
I got some blasters unless
you guys wanna use knives.

1697
02:39:33,572 --> 02:39:36,064
Oh, yes. Please, use knives.

1698
02:39:36,947 --> 02:39:38,204
I am Groot.

1699
02:39:44,971 --> 02:39:45,971
Not necessary.

1700
02:39:46,018 --> 02:39:47,915
There shall be no
knifing one another.

1701
02:39:47,940 --> 02:39:50,549
Everybody knows who's in charge.

1702
02:39:54,213 --> 02:39:55,346
It's me.

1703
02:39:58,736 --> 02:40:01,635
Yes, you! Of course!

1704
02:40:02,002 --> 02:40:04,502
Of course. Of course.

1705
02:40:06,909 --> 02:40:07,994
Remember...

1706
02:40:09,375 --> 02:40:11,734
You have to return the stones at
the exact moment you got them.

1707
02:40:11,758 --> 02:40:15,422
Or you're gonna open up a bunch
of nasty alternative realities.

1708
02:40:15,484 --> 02:40:17,585
Don't worry, Bruce.
Clip all the branches.

1709
02:40:18,953 --> 02:40:20,437
You know, I tried.

1710
02:40:22,094 --> 02:40:25,812
When I had the gauntlet, the stones,
I really tried to bring her back.

1711
02:40:29,668 --> 02:40:32,910
- I miss them, man.
- Me, too.

1712
02:40:36,488 --> 02:40:39,457
You know, if you want,
I can come with you.

1713
02:40:41,740 --> 02:40:43,482
You're a good man, Sam.

1714
02:40:43,605 --> 02:40:45,651
This one's on me, though.

1715
02:40:49,566 --> 02:40:52,081
Don't do anything stupid
'till I get back.

1716
02:40:53,516 --> 02:40:56,711
How can I? You're taking
all the stupid with you.

1717
02:41:04,212 --> 02:41:05,742
Gonna miss you, Buddy.

1718
02:41:05,976 --> 02:41:07,836
It's gonna be okay, Buck.

1719
02:41:15,098 --> 02:41:17,191
How long is this gonna take?

1720
02:41:17,316 --> 02:41:20,112
For him? As long as he
needs, For us, five seconds.

1721
02:41:25,212 --> 02:41:26,462
Ready, Cap?

1722
02:41:26,759 --> 02:41:29,352
Alright. We'll meet
you back here, okay?

1723
02:41:29,517 --> 02:41:30,766
You bet.

1724
02:41:31,829 --> 02:41:36,712
Going quantum. Three..
two.. one...

1725
02:41:38,454 --> 02:41:45,430
And returning in, five,
four, three, two, one...

1726
02:41:52,786 --> 02:41:54,036
Where is he?

1727
02:41:54,083 --> 02:41:57,379
I don't know. He blew right by his
time stamp. He should be here.

1728
02:42:02,978 --> 02:42:04,342
- Well, get him back.
- I'm trying.

1729
02:42:04,367 --> 02:42:06,851
- Get him the hell back.
- I said, I'm trying!

1730
02:42:06,921 --> 02:42:08,007
Sam.

1731
02:42:31,197 --> 02:42:32,374
Go ahead.

1732
02:42:50,809 --> 02:42:51,809
Cap?

1733
02:42:53,731 --> 02:42:55,168
Hi, Sam.

1734
02:42:58,624 --> 02:43:01,569
So did something go wrong,
or did something go right?

1735
02:43:03,616 --> 02:43:07,241
Well, after I put the
stones back, I thought...

1736
02:43:08,741 --> 02:43:12,678
Maybe I'll try some
of that life Tony was...

1737
02:43:13,374 --> 02:43:15,233
telling me to get.

1738
02:43:17,351 --> 02:43:19,522
How did that work out for you?

1739
02:43:21,905 --> 02:43:23,295
It was beautiful.

1740
02:43:24,818 --> 02:43:27,333
I'm happy for you. Truly.

1741
02:43:28,296 --> 02:43:29,420
Thank you.

1742
02:43:30,960 --> 02:43:33,092
Only thing bumming me
out is the fact I have

1743
02:43:33,117 --> 02:43:35,600
to live in a world
without Captain America.

1744
02:43:36,538 --> 02:43:37,538
Oh...

1745
02:43:39,741 --> 02:43:41,053
That reminds me...

1746
02:43:50,922 --> 02:43:52,117
Try it on.

1747
02:44:17,613 --> 02:44:19,003
How's it feel?

1748
02:44:21,480 --> 02:44:23,479
Like it's someone else's.

1749
02:44:26,409 --> 02:44:27,574
It isn't.

1750
02:44:40,912 --> 02:44:42,122
Thank you.

1751
02:44:44,285 --> 02:44:45,730
I'll do my best.

1752
02:44:51,042 --> 02:44:52,637
That's why it's yours.

1753
02:44:54,684 --> 02:44:56,551
You wanna tell me about her?

1754
02:45:02,469 --> 02:45:03,469
No.

1755
02:45:04,468 --> 02:45:06,195
No, I don't think I will.
