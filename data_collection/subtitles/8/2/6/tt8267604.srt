1
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:05,375
Lift up your head.

2
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:13,541
He has no more baby teeth.

3
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:18,666
I'd estimate he's 12, even 13.

4
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:21,500
Michelle, Filipina?

5
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:22,791
Michelle ?

6
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:25,375
What is your surname?

7
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:27,083
Surname?


9
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,625
- Sedad.
- Sedad.

10
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:34,500
Do you have a passeport?
Entry visa?

11
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:36,625
At the house, with my employer.

12
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,041
Lama Bekoum.

13
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:42,625
Who is Lama ?

14
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,500
- Lama, you are pregnant?
- Oui.

15
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:46,875
How far along?

16
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:48,416
Seven months.

17
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:52,125
OK, <i>Caritas</i> will see you.

18
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:54,916
Who is Tigest Ailo ?

19
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:56,916
The Ethiopian, Tigest Ailo ?

20
00:01:57,958 --> 00:01:59,333
You're Tigest ?

21
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,958
Court is in session.

22
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:42,666
Zain Al Hajj.

23
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,416
Remove the handcuffs.
Approach the bench.

24
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,000
Souad and Selim Al Hajj.

25
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,208
Yes.

26
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,750
The plaintiff is in detention.

27
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:56,833
He is present without handcuffs.
Show me your hands.

28
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,625
Also in attendance...

29
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,750
His lawyer Nadine Al Aalam.

30
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,083
The accused are also present

31
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,458
Selim and Souad Al Hajj,

32
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:12,958
represented by their lawyer Saiid Tamer.

33
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,875
Do you know why you're here, Souad ?

34
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:21,250
Yes, I know, Your Honor.

35
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:22,666
Why?

36
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,166
I know my son is
serving time in prison,

37
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,541
but why he dragged us here again,
I don't know.

38
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,791
We're nobodies,
anybody pushes us around!

39
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,875
You were called as witnesses
in Zain's trial, correct?

40
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:34,875
Yes.

41
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,166
And you testified?

42
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,416
Yes.

43
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,583
And now you stand accused.

44
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:42,250
You know why Zain was found guilty?

45
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:47,541
Zain got into trouble
for some kidstuff.

46
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:51,750
Kidstuff? He was
sentenced to 5 years!

47
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,458
Kidstuff?

48
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,083
So...

49
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,750
How old are you Zain ?

50
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,083
I don't know, ask them.

51
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,166
Your Honor, Zain was
not registered at birth,

52
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:08,083
and never registered
with the State.

53
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,750
Since his parents clearly don't know

54
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,416
his exact date of birth...

55
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,291
Here is the doctor's report

56
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:20,875
attesting Zain was around 12

57
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,166
at the time of the incident.

58
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,583
So he's around 12 years old?

59
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,000
Precisely.

60
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,208
Where do you live Zain ?

61
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,375
Roumieh Prison for Minors.

62
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:35,125
You were arrested June 15th
and have been serving time since,

63
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,583
do you know why?

64
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:40,458
Because I stuck a knife
into the son of a dog.

65
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,666
You stabbed someone?

66
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:43,958
Yes and he's the son of a dog.

67
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,000
Really?

68
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:46,750
You insist?

69
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,750
No laughing in court!

70
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,250
What's all this trouble you caused?

71
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:55,541
On T.V., in the papers.
Your phone call from prison...

72
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,125
- Do you know why you're here?
- Yes.

73
00:07:58,916 --> 00:07:59,791
Why?

74
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,708
I want to accuse my parents.

75
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:06,166
Why do you want
to accuse your parents?

76
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:12,291
For bringing me into the world.

77
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,541
Good day.

78
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,875
I'd like 2 boxes of Tramadol.

79
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,750
You need a prescription.

80
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,750
- Who's it for?
- My mother.

81
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,291
Why can't she come?

82
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,375
She had a stomach operation.

83
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,333
She broke her back.

84
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,916
Her doctor prescribed this?

85
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:47,916
Yes.

86
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,125
Why can't your father come?

87
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:51,500
He's paralyzed.

88
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,625
- Who are you here to see, madam?
- My son.

89
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,791
- His name?
- Ibrahim Al Hajj.

90
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,875
- Ibrahim Al Hajj?
- Yes.

91
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,916
Aunt Souad?
Up here!

92
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:23,583
Massoud? Is that you?
How are you?

93
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,958
How are you, my dear?

94
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:29,041
Is my son Ibrahim with you?

95
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,875
No, they brought him
to another cell.

96
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,666
She's calling to you!

97
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,166
Tell him goodbye.

98
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,291
Say goodbye to your cousin.

99
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,500
Are all your brothers in your cell?

100
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:42,500
Yes, everyone.

101
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,208
May God protect you.

102
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,791
We raised prices to $15 a gulp.

103
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,625
Our hands are all messed up
from the soaking and wringing.

104
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:09,458
Our "sock juice" costs more
than 2 pounds of meat!

105
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,541
I'm proud of you!

106
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,833
Hurry up!

107
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:55,333
- Do we have a test tomorrow?
- Look at your schedule.

108
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,083
This is for your mother.

109
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,416
And this is for my lovely Sahar.

110
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,000
I miss her.

111
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,375
Licorice and ramen.

112
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:16,916
Thank you.

113
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,416
Later.

114
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,250
Assaad's father is a bonehead.

115
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:01,208
When he fills the water tank,

116
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:04,666
we get soaked because of
his crappy plumbing!

117
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:09,375
That fool thinks this is a gift?
This rathole?

118
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,541
Sahar!

119
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,208
This isn't a house!

120
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,833
It's a shelter for pigs!

121
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:21,708
Get out! You'll electrocute
yourself, damn it!

122
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:25,375
- The awful place!
- Go live in the street.

123
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,791
There's plenty of room!

124
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:35,208
Zain, why are these vegetables rotten?
Did you upset Assaad?

125
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:41,375
Zain, did he give you
licorice and ramen?

126
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:37,458
It's not daybreak yet!
Get off my case!

127
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,291
Get up, good-for-nothing!

128
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,625
This juice is best,
forget the rest!

129
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,708
Sahar, come here with me.

130
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,250
Why is there blood on your shorts?

131
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:44,958
Blood where?

132
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,791
Hurry before someone sees us.

133
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,625
Remember what happened
to your friend Alia?

134
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:05,375
When her mother found out
they locked her up at home,

135
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:09,000
then some fat pig
came and took her.

136
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,833
Mom won't want you.
She'll toss you in the street.

137
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,958
- She'll give you to Assaad.
- But Assaad is really nice.

138
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,208
He's an asshole!

139
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,500
He gives me licorice and ramen.

140
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,500
He'll feed you scraps!

141
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,916
They'll give you to Assaad,
they'll get rid of you.

142
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,791
We'll never see you again.

143
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:31,458
He'll put you with the rats,
lock you up, cover the windows...

144
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,541
Never let you outside.

145
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:37,750
He'll give you a drop of water 
every 3 days with expired ramen.

146
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:43,541
Didn't you see his ear?
A sewer rat bit him.

147
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,250
Here, put this on.

148
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,625
Are you finished?

149
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,000
Yes.

150
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:04,666
Here.

151
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,166
What do I do with it?

152
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,708
Put it like this
between your legs.

153
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:33,416
Your hair is so lovely!
Who styled it?

154
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:34,750
Show me.

155
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,041
So chief, are you finished?

156
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,666
I have to put more cans away,
but my mother needs Sahar.

157
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,000
Stay a bit longer.
I enjoy having your sister here.

158
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,541
I'll bring her back later.

159
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,750
I'll talk to your mother.

160
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,083
Goodbye.

161
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:52,750
Careful, don't leave
those rags just anywhere.

162
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,833
I'll show you where to hide them.

163
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,791
- You understand?
- Yes.

164
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:03,333
Don't toss them in the garbage.

165
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,958
Juice of beet, flavor so sweet!

166
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:20,916
Tomato so red, use your head!

167
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,416
It's 250.

168
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,833
Thank you, bye.

169
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,750
Here.

170
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,375
God bless you.

171
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,458
Take two of them.

172
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,458
What do you want?

173
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:51,166
- Just to show you something.
- Leave me alone.

174
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,166
Just a little while!

175
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,791
Screw yourself, you pig.

176
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,458
Leave him, Zain.

177
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,458
Don't piss me off!

178
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,666
Why sign up for school?

179
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:14,666
Out of the question. Forget it,
just keep working for Assaad.

180
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:18,208
Why complicate things?

181
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,500
Couldn't he go learn a few words?

182
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:24,500
Go beside your sister,
but don't wake her.

183
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,500
Let him go to school.

184
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:32,125
They give for food and clothing,
for the children...

185
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,166
What do we tell Assaad?

186
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,708
I'll talk to him.

187
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:40,583
I'll go to school 
in the morning,

188
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,458
and work for him
in the afternoon.

189
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:46,541
Look Farid,
the neighbor's son, Zahra.

190
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:49,833
Returns from school
with all kinds of things

191
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,583
They give us mattresses, clothing...


192
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,583
Be quiet!

193
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,625
At least he'll eat there,
and bring back food for his sisters.

194
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:01,458
They get hotel leftovers,
fancy wedding food.

195
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:05,375
Let's take advantage!
Why are you so stubborn?

196
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,541
<i>Inch'Allah</i> we'll see Monday.

197
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:08,625
<i>Inch'Allah</i> ?

198
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,541
You want me to swear on this bread?

199
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,250
I said yes.

200
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,666
And if Assaad gets angry
and kicks us us out?

201
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,000
Don't worry, he won't.

202
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:21,500
We'll send Zain after school,
and he'll take overtime.

203
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:41,958
Soap from my balls!

204
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,708
Why are you pouting?

205
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,083
Take it easy.

206
00:21:57,125 --> 00:22:01,375
Bring a gas canister
to Em Habib down the street.

207
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:39,791
Madam Bahia, I'm done.

208
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:41,958
- How much is it?
- 13000.

209
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:07,625
Don't touch me, asshole!

210
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:27,375
Where do these hens come from?

211
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:29,333
Who brought them?

212
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:31,000
Assaad. He's upstairs.

213
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:34,000
Assaad is here?

214
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:35,083
Yes.

215
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,375
Mom?

216
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:59,500
What are Assaad and
his father doing here?

217
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:02,433
- Don't make a scene.
- You'll see.

218
00:24:02,633 --> 00:24:04,291
- Why are they here?
- Calm down.

219
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,458
They're talking rent with your father.

220
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:08,333
I'd cut off my left hand

221
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,416
and they give a few hens for Sahar.

222
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:11,958
Wait, listen to me...

223
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:15,000
Tell that son of a bitch
he's not welcome here 

224
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:17,750
- You don't understand?
- Tell him or I will.

225
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:18,916
Lower your voice.

226
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,875
I swear by your sisters,
I swear to God.

227
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:24,375
There's none of that going on.

228
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:29,500
- So why is Sahar wearing makeup?
- She's imitating me for fun.

229
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:31,750
As soon as they finish their juice,
I'm kicking them out.

230
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:34,541
Listen, don't.

231
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:36,708
Go tell him it won't work.

232
00:24:36,916 --> 00:24:38,750
Tell him or I will.

233
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:41,083
I don't want to hear it.

234
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,208
You want him to
throw us in the street?

235
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:44,583
Not a word.

236
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:47,250
Welcome dear neighbors!

237
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:52,458
Abou Assaad, please help yourself.

238
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:54,083
Thank you.

239
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,833
Have some, Assaad.

240
00:24:56,875 --> 00:24:59,791
Dearie, take your sister 
into the other room.

241
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:12,208
Wipe off that ugly lipstick.

242
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:15,458
You look like a witch
in that dress.

243
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,875
Sahar...

244
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:45,375
Sahar!

245
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:48,416
Wake up,
I want to bring you somewhere.

246
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:51,583
- Where ?
- I'll tell you later. Wake up.

247
00:27:52,833 --> 00:27:55,083
Be ready when I get back.

248
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,458
Don't tell anyone.

249
00:28:43,833 --> 00:28:45,333
How much to Kola?

250
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,833
1000.

251
00:28:48,958 --> 00:28:53,458
Is 1000 enough with my sister,
sitting on my lap?

252
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,458
Where's your sister?

253
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:57,166
At home, I'll go get her.

254
00:28:57,333 --> 00:29:00,458
No problem,
go get her.

255
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:16,291
I don't want to leave, mercy...

256
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:18,875
Please! I don't want to go.

257
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:21,875
Mom, I don't want to go!

258
00:29:22,041 --> 00:29:24,750
Don't you dare come back here.

259
00:29:25,208 --> 00:29:27,708
Where are you taking her,
you bunch of cretins?

260
00:29:27,958 --> 00:29:30,708
To be a maid for
that son of a bitch?

261
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:33,125
I want to stay with my brother.

262
00:29:33,291 --> 00:29:34,625
It's none of your business.

263
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:37,750
- Mom, she's just a child.
- Mind your own business.

264
00:29:37,916 --> 00:29:39,541
Step away I said!

265
00:29:39,708 --> 00:29:41,041
Don't get mixed up in this.

266
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,333
You, go downstairs.

267
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,208
Zain, try anything and I'll kill you.

268
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:47,208
I see your game, you dirtball.

269
00:29:47,375 --> 00:29:50,041
You were going to screw us over,
you piece of garbage.

270
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:53,875
You're sending her to wipe up
that pig's filth!

271
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:55,750
Go screw yourself,
you, get downstairs.

272
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:57,708
Down, now.

273
00:29:58,416 --> 00:29:59,458
Let her go!

274
00:29:59,666 --> 00:30:01,583
She won't go to Assaad !

275
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:03,750
Little bastard!

276
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:05,333
Open the door, you idiot.

277
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,333
I don't want to go, mom!

278
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,916
I don't want to!

279
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:10,625
Let me go!

280
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,000
Please mom,
I don't want to go.

281
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:15,541
Come, Sahar !

282
00:30:16,666 --> 00:30:17,625
That's enough!

283
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:21,958
You stay here, I said!

284
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:28,291
- I want to stay. Please!
- Downstairs.

285
00:30:28,833 --> 00:30:30,958
Downstairs! Downstairs!

286
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,333
Mom have mercy, please!

287
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,333
Son of a bitch.

288
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:40,208
Enough!
I've had it with this hell!

289
00:30:40,375 --> 00:30:42,458
Mom, I don't want to go!

290
00:30:42,958 --> 00:30:45,500
Stop it!
I've had enough of your whining!

291
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:50,208
Make her climb on!

292
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:53,666
One more word and
I cut your tongue off!

293
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:04,125
No!

294
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:14,291
Sahar!

295
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:17,458
Sahar!

296
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:19,708
Let her go!

297
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,000
Are you happy now?

298
00:31:31,916 --> 00:31:35,166
You're playing the big man?

299
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:39,458
You'll be sorry, you good-for-nothing!


301
00:32:16,541 --> 00:32:19,666
It was to lift her out of misery.

302
00:32:19,833 --> 00:32:21,666
With me she was doomed.

303
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:24,833
She barely has a bed to sleep in,

304
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,916
barely any food or drink.
She doesn't wash herself.

305
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:29,833
Never watches TV.

306
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:33,916
I told myself, "Marry her,
at least she'll sleep in a bed."

307
00:32:34,125 --> 00:32:35,416
A real bed.

308
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:38,708
With a blanket.

309
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:40,500
She can eat as much as she likes.

310
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:43,875
- You didn't know it would come to this?
- Never!

311
00:32:44,666 --> 00:32:47,041
I didn't ask for this!

312
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:54,875
You think I'm proud
that my son stabbed someone?

313
00:32:55,166 --> 00:32:57,958
Have you considered
it might not be our fault?

314
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:01,291
I was born this way, raised this way,
how have I done wrong?

315
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:05,375
If I'd had choices,
I might be better than all of you!

316
00:33:05,791 --> 00:33:08,666
- You can't say such things.
- Please...

317
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:12,166
People spit on me in the street.

318
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:15,166
They treat me like an animal.

319
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:20,125
I never asked for any of this.

320
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:23,250
They told me, "You're not a man 
if you have no children."

321
00:33:23,416 --> 00:33:26,166
"Children will be your backbone."

322
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:29,666
But they broke my back,
then broke my heart.

323
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:32,750
I curse the day I got married.

324
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:36,083
How did I sink to this misery?

325
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:24,458
I'm not him, kiddo.

326
00:34:25,041 --> 00:34:26,250
We just look alike, that's all.

327
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:36,125
That should be a spider,
not a cockroach.

328
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:37,458
Isn't that right?

329
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:41,750
I don't need a spider,
I'm Cockroachman.

330
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:44,708
Why would I want a spider?

331
00:34:46,166 --> 00:34:48,666
That's right.
I'm Cockroachman.

332
00:34:49,625 --> 00:34:53,125
How are you connected to Spiderman?

333
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:55,083
What's the relation?

334
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,458
I'm his cousin.

335
00:34:58,916 --> 00:35:00,625
So you're cousins?

336
00:35:00,791 --> 00:35:03,625
That's right. His cousin.

337
00:35:08,666 --> 00:35:11,208
- What's your name?
- Zain.

338
00:35:11,416 --> 00:35:13,583
- Hussein?
- Zain!

339
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:14,583
Zain!

340
00:35:14,791 --> 00:35:16,166
Where are you headed, Zain ?

341
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:17,916
To my grandmother's.

342
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:20,333
- Speak louder.
- To my grandmother's!

343
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,500
Your grandmother's?

344
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,333
Well, she's lucky to have you.

345
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:27,708
Nobody takes care of me.

346
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:31,000
- My life is...
- Please, the cigarette.

347
00:35:31,708 --> 00:35:33,125
Please.

348
00:35:37,833 --> 00:35:39,750
Stop the bus, driver.

349
00:35:39,916 --> 00:35:42,541
I'll get off here, if you please.

350
00:36:03,416 --> 00:36:05,791
Driver, wait.

351
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:08,125
I'd like to get off too, please.

352
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:12,125
Try my corn,
you'll be glad you were born...

353
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:20,833
Mister Cockroachman?

354
00:39:22,208 --> 00:39:24,166
Is the owner here?

355
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:26,250
Excuse me?

356
00:39:26,708 --> 00:39:27,958
Is the owner here?

357
00:39:28,791 --> 00:39:30,833
What do you want with him?

358
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,625
I'm looking for work.

359
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,166
What kind of work?

360
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:43,208
Anything, working is what counts.

361
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:50,583
What's your name?

362
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:52,833
Zain.

363
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:54,708
Zain?

364
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:56,458
And yours?

365
00:39:56,958 --> 00:39:58,583
My name is Tigest.

366
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:05,166
I can wash floors
or clean dishes, for example.

367
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:07,166
I don't think so.

368
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:12,958
Do you need a worker?

369
00:40:14,208 --> 00:40:17,583
Need someone to carry
your fishing rod?

370
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,916
Where are your parents?

371
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:24,291
Where are they?

372
00:40:30,458 --> 00:40:34,708
Sir, do you have juice for 250?

373
00:40:35,416 --> 00:40:37,791
Or anything else for 250?

374
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:40,500
The juice is 1000.

375
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:44,000
- Anything less expensive?
- No.

376
00:40:56,083 --> 00:40:57,583
Go ahead.

377
00:40:58,333 --> 00:40:59,750
Take it, I said.

378
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,625
Don't worry, just take it.

379
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:40,375
It's occupied, Madam.

380
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:42,458
Here too?

381
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,666
Yes, and this one's out of service.

382
00:43:06,291 --> 00:43:07,625
Tigest?

383
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:12,916
Tigest?

384
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,291
Do you have anything to eat?

385
00:43:16,541 --> 00:43:17,666
Please.

386
00:44:06,041 --> 00:44:07,125
Zain.

387
00:45:30,166 --> 00:45:32,333
The milk is over here, OK ?

388
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:39,750
Give hime one at 11 o'clock,
and another at 2.

389
00:45:40,375 --> 00:45:42,375
I get back at 3 o'clock.

390
00:46:02,166 --> 00:46:04,625
Don't leave the house, alright?

391
00:46:05,375 --> 00:46:10,083
Don't let Yonas cry,
the neighbour gets upset.

392
00:46:11,083 --> 00:46:14,541
Stay with your friend.
I'll be back, Yoni.

393
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:17,583
He's your new friend, OK?

394
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:20,875
Zain is your new friend.

395
00:46:24,416 --> 00:46:25,750
Are you sleepy?

396
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:26,166
Tell him you have no money.

397
00:47:26,333 --> 00:47:31,875
I did, but he won't make
my papers for less than $1500.

398
00:47:32,666 --> 00:47:37,625
I must renew them,
they'll expire soon.

399
00:47:38,875 --> 00:47:42,291
Do what you can, but hurry.

400
00:47:45,666 --> 00:47:47,958
Plenty are getting arrested.

401
00:47:48,125 --> 00:47:50,291
Sometimes in the middle of the night.

402
00:47:56,666 --> 00:47:59,375
You smell like shit, little shitter!

403
00:48:08,875 --> 00:48:10,375
Hold still!

404
00:48:13,375 --> 00:48:14,875
Sit down.

405
00:48:16,041 --> 00:48:17,333
Sit down, damn it!

406
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,583
It fell over!

407
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,750
<i>Go to sleep, go to sleep...</i>

408
00:48:48,083 --> 00:48:49,375
Come on, go to sleep.

409
00:48:51,541 --> 00:48:54,041
What do you want from here?

410
00:48:58,416 --> 00:49:02,875
<i>Go to sleep, little brother Yonas...</i>

411
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:07,000
<i>Sleep, don't make a peep...</i>

412
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:40,083
Try some corn, my darling.

413
00:49:41,708 --> 00:49:43,083
Bye, Harout.

414
00:49:43,791 --> 00:49:47,125
Come in, come in!
Welcome!

415
00:49:49,416 --> 00:49:51,458
Hot, hot!

416
00:50:29,083 --> 00:50:30,791
Blow, blow it out.

417
00:50:34,083 --> 00:50:35,666
Blow, Zain.

418
00:50:51,875 --> 00:50:53,750
How old are you, Zain ?

419
00:50:54,791 --> 00:50:56,375
I don't know.
12, I think.

420
00:51:06,333 --> 00:51:08,375
You have brothers and sisters?

421
00:51:08,666 --> 00:51:09,958
Many.

422
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:13,791
- You don't miss them?
- Sure.

423
00:51:14,375 --> 00:51:17,375
The one I miss the most,
is my sister Sahar.

424
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:19,875
- Where is she?
- With her husband.

425
00:51:20,041 --> 00:51:20,875
She's married?

426
00:51:21,083 --> 00:51:23,416
Yes, there were drums and a darbouka.

427
00:51:23,583 --> 00:51:25,666
We paraded in the street.

428
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:27,750
People threw rice and flowers.

429
00:51:27,916 --> 00:51:29,458
Congratulations.

430
00:51:39,375 --> 00:51:40,625
Rahil Eresa.

431
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:43,000
- Family name?
- Shifara.

432
00:51:44,708 --> 00:51:46,916
Do you know why you're in prison?

433
00:51:47,166 --> 00:51:48,458
Why you're handcuffed?

434
00:51:49,208 --> 00:51:51,583
- I don't have residency permits.
- No papers.

435
00:51:51,791 --> 00:51:53,750
Where did you work?

436
00:51:53,916 --> 00:51:55,875
I worked for a lady for 6 years.

437
00:51:56,083 --> 00:51:58,125
Then you ran away?

438
00:51:58,875 --> 00:52:00,416
The lady wasn't nice to you?

439
00:52:00,583 --> 00:52:01,791
She beat you?

440
00:52:01,958 --> 00:52:05,583
No, she was very nice,
but I fell in love,

441
00:52:06,541 --> 00:52:08,125
then I got pregnant
and I left...

442
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:09,166
You got what?

443
00:52:09,791 --> 00:52:12,458
I got pregnant and left...

444
00:52:12,666 --> 00:52:14,125
You speak Arabic well.

445
00:52:14,291 --> 00:52:16,166
You understand what I'm saying?

446
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:18,458
- Yes, I understand.
- So no need for a translator?

447
00:52:18,625 --> 00:52:19,500
No.

448
00:52:20,541 --> 00:52:23,166
So you left so the lady
wouldn't find out?

449
00:52:23,333 --> 00:52:27,666
I was scared of police,
they'd take my son and expel me.

450
00:52:27,833 --> 00:52:30,250
I was scared
so I didn't tell anyone.

451
00:52:30,708 --> 00:52:33,791
So you'd leave Yonas with Zain?

452
00:52:33,958 --> 00:52:36,833
When you came home,
he had taken good care of him?

453
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,708
You never imagined
he could hurt him?

454
00:52:39,916 --> 00:52:44,916
Maybe the first 2 days,

455
00:52:45,083 --> 00:52:48,041
but afterwards,
I started to trust him.

456
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:50,666
Did you expect Zain
to do what he did?

457
00:52:50,875 --> 00:52:51,833
Never.

458
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,833
They were like brothers.

459
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:58,375
I never blamed Zain,

460
00:52:59,041 --> 00:53:01,291
because I know Aspro.

461
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,000
Who is Aspro?

462
00:53:03,166 --> 00:53:05,708
The guy who forged my permit.

463
00:53:06,666 --> 00:53:09,041
SOUK AL AHAD

464
00:53:18,291 --> 00:53:20,291
I gave you until today, no?

465
00:53:20,875 --> 00:53:22,833
But I spoke to my friend.

466
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,916
Her papers get made for $900.

467
00:53:27,125 --> 00:53:29,500
Get her to make your papers then!

468
00:53:29,708 --> 00:53:33,125
No, but why is the price different?

469
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:36,416
Stop this nonsense,
don't try to con me.

470
00:53:36,583 --> 00:53:38,333
Calm down and let me talk.

471
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,750
I'm trying to help you here.

472
00:53:39,958 --> 00:53:42,500
Who gave you the name Tigest?
I did.

473
00:53:42,708 --> 00:53:46,583
Go to your friend 
who gets papers for $900.

474
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:47,625
Don't antagonize me.

475
00:53:48,166 --> 00:53:51,000
Please, I couldn't get $1500.

476
00:53:51,208 --> 00:53:53,750
Look at this!
Does this look fake?

477
00:53:53,958 --> 00:53:55,708
Nobody will harass you
with these papers.

478
00:53:55,875 --> 00:53:57,791
The woman on these papers...
Boom!

479
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,208
She blew up into small pieces.

480
00:53:59,375 --> 00:54:02,500
She had no one, no family.
No one claimed her remains.

481
00:54:02,666 --> 00:54:05,000
You can take off your 
beauty mark, no need for it.

482
00:54:05,166 --> 00:54:06,583
OK, but I need more time.

483
00:54:07,041 --> 00:54:10,500
Darling, I said you can save $1500.

484
00:54:10,666 --> 00:54:12,833
Give me Yonas
and the permit will be free.

485
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,333
Don't speak the name Yonas again,

486
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,708
I'd never do that!

487
00:54:17,916 --> 00:54:20,791
Your kid lives like
a fugitive in this country.

488
00:54:21,041 --> 00:54:24,541
The day they discover him,
you'll both be expelled.

489
00:54:24,916 --> 00:54:27,500
He lives underground,
like a rat.

490
00:54:27,958 --> 00:54:31,375
He never sees the sun,
he'll never go to school.

491
00:54:31,541 --> 00:54:34,416
I'm offering him a family.

492
00:54:34,583 --> 00:54:35,666
You can see him from time to time.

493
00:54:35,875 --> 00:54:38,416
I know how to hide my son.

494
00:54:38,583 --> 00:54:41,875
To feed and take care of him.

495
00:54:42,041 --> 00:54:46,666
I keep telling you,
your son was born dead.

496
00:54:46,833 --> 00:54:47,666
He doesn't exist.

497
00:54:47,875 --> 00:54:51,208
Even a bottle of ketchup has a name.

498
00:54:51,958 --> 00:54:54,375
With date of manufacture and expiry.

499
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,958
I can't listen to this!

500
00:54:58,166 --> 00:55:00,166
How much are you short?

501
00:55:00,333 --> 00:55:03,625
- $500.
- You're short $500?

502
00:55:04,208 --> 00:55:06,166
I can buy a kid for $500.

503
00:55:06,958 --> 00:55:09,458
So you don't think
that Aspro is a crook,

504
00:55:09,625 --> 00:55:12,791
I'll go lower by $200,

505
00:55:13,166 --> 00:55:14,583
and give you 7 more days.

506
00:55:15,041 --> 00:55:17,875
Either return with the money,
or with your son,

507
00:55:18,083 --> 00:55:21,333
or don't show your
pretty face here again.

508
00:55:21,583 --> 00:55:22,416
You understand?

509
00:55:24,083 --> 00:55:28,000
So take your time,
all the time you need.

510
00:56:15,375 --> 00:56:16,666
Look.

511
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:22,375
<i>Hello, how are you, friend?</i>

512
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:24,208
<i>Doing well, my brother?</i>

513
00:56:24,375 --> 00:56:27,208
<i>I saw you rolling a joint.</i>

514
00:56:27,666 --> 00:56:28,500
<i>Me?</i>

515
00:56:28,833 --> 00:56:30,666
<i>Your mother is a fat whore...</i>

516
00:56:30,833 --> 00:56:32,125
<i>You pussy looking wimp.</i>

517
00:56:33,875 --> 00:56:35,666
<i>You cocksucker.</i>

518
00:56:36,041 --> 00:56:37,583
<i>Stop fooling around shithead.</i>

519
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:40,125
<i>Asshole!</i>

520
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:43,500
<i>Your mother wears army boots.</i>

521
00:56:45,333 --> 00:56:48,750
<i>Close your damn window
I'm sick of smelling your food!</i>

522
00:56:48,916 --> 00:56:52,083
I'll make her eat shit
if she keeps nagging me.

523
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:54,916
Do I lay into her, or what?

524
00:56:55,958 --> 00:56:59,166
What a fat whore...

525
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,000
Dirty bitch...

526
00:57:01,208 --> 00:57:02,500
Are you going to...?

527
00:57:07,666 --> 00:57:10,416
I've had enough,
you need to get my pay!

528
00:57:10,583 --> 00:57:13,916
You know the guy.
You found the job for me.

529
00:57:17,958 --> 00:57:20,750
I'm not the owner.
I can't give you money.

530
00:57:20,916 --> 00:57:23,625
If it was up to me,
I'd give it to you.

531
00:57:23,833 --> 00:57:26,458
I am Tigest, you know me?

532
00:57:26,916 --> 00:57:28,458
Recognize me?

533
00:57:29,333 --> 00:57:32,125
Come back after noon,
maybe the boss will be here.

534
00:57:45,791 --> 00:57:50,541
No. No advances.
It's early in the month.

535
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:55,083
You're illegal,
I'm already taking risks.

536
00:57:55,666 --> 00:57:58,666
Please,
I'll do what you want.

537
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:32,833
Here's the boss lady's I.D. card.

538
00:58:33,041 --> 00:58:36,958
I stole it for you.
You know how much she trusts me.

539
00:58:37,875 --> 00:58:40,166
It's not a bad thing,
it's for the kid

540
00:58:40,708 --> 00:58:42,791
You know what happens
if they find out?

541
00:58:42,958 --> 00:58:44,583
They'll expel you with the kid.

542
00:58:44,791 --> 00:58:47,416
God knows what they'll do to me.

543
00:58:47,916 --> 00:58:49,458
I'm just a watchman.

544
00:58:49,833 --> 00:58:51,541
They'll replace me
in the blink of an eye.

545
00:58:51,708 --> 00:58:54,333
- You don't want to see a photo?
- I don't.

546
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,208
Please, just go.

547
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:00,000
Before, I worked for a lady.

548
00:59:00,166 --> 00:59:02,833
Then, I ran away.

549
00:59:03,583 --> 00:59:07,166
So she has to pretend
she's my old boss.

550
00:59:07,916 --> 00:59:09,708
And say I'm no longer needed.

551
00:59:09,875 --> 00:59:11,541
She doesn't want you.

552
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:14,500
So she'll transfer me to you.

553
00:59:14,708 --> 00:59:17,416
You'll become my sponsor.

554
00:59:18,166 --> 00:59:19,333
My boss.

555
00:59:19,666 --> 00:59:21,625
This is Jacqueline.

556
00:59:21,791 --> 00:59:22,833
Who am I?

557
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,500
I'm not Jaqueline, I'm Daad.

558
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,250
I will pretend I'm Jacqueline.

559
00:59:27,416 --> 00:59:29,708
You have to work for me?

560
00:59:29,958 --> 00:59:31,916
But I don't need an employee.

561
00:59:32,083 --> 00:59:34,250
Oh God, I'm jumping out the window.

562
00:59:34,791 --> 00:59:38,416
I can't pay for a maid.

563
00:59:38,583 --> 00:59:42,333
I don't have $500 to hire her.

564
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,708
You see this cockroach?

565
00:59:44,875 --> 00:59:46,500
It already understood.

566
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:49,166
If I ask it,
it will explain the whole scam.

567
00:59:54,916 --> 00:59:56,958
As with all Lebanese...

568
00:59:57,166 --> 00:59:59,208
To relinquish and transfer.

569
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:01,666
Where do you live?

570
01:00:01,833 --> 01:00:03,041
Arax.

571
01:00:04,166 --> 01:00:05,416
Apartment?

572
01:00:05,583 --> 01:00:07,291
Khachik Papikian.

573
01:00:07,625 --> 01:00:10,583
Do you have a light, Mr. Harout ?

574
01:00:14,375 --> 01:00:15,500
Thank you.

575
01:00:16,083 --> 01:00:17,166
Sorry, do you smoke?

576
01:00:17,333 --> 01:00:18,708
No, thank you.

577
01:00:20,375 --> 01:00:22,416
Why don't you want this girl?

578
01:00:22,833 --> 01:00:25,250
I have children in Canada, God bless them.

579
01:00:25,416 --> 01:00:27,458
They want to send me a Filipina.

580
01:00:27,875 --> 01:00:29,250
Are they better?

581
01:00:29,708 --> 01:00:32,583
- More prestigious.
- They're different.

582
01:00:32,791 --> 01:00:36,041
And you? Do you accept
to work for this man?

583
01:00:38,083 --> 01:00:41,833
I want to sponsor this Filipina.

584
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,166
With everything.

585
01:00:43,375 --> 01:00:45,166
I want to help her.

586
01:00:45,333 --> 01:00:46,250
She's Ethiopian.

587
01:00:46,416 --> 01:00:48,583
I want to give her to my wife.

588
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:50,166
What is your occupation?

589
01:00:50,333 --> 01:00:52,666
I have an electronics store.

590
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:55,208
What is it called?

591
01:00:55,375 --> 01:00:56,916
Haroutchum...

592
01:00:57,083 --> 01:00:58,083
Electric.

593
01:00:58,791 --> 01:01:01,125
The address where the girl will reside?

594
01:01:01,541 --> 01:01:03,333
Dawra, Bourj Hamoud.

595
01:01:03,833 --> 01:01:04,791
Your telephone number?

596
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:07,166
09...

597
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:11,500
4, 5, 6...
Something like that.

598
01:01:11,708 --> 01:01:12,791
Something like that?

599
01:01:12,958 --> 01:01:14,666
This man is Armenian.

600
01:01:14,833 --> 01:01:17,375
You can't take him literally.

601
01:01:17,541 --> 01:01:20,166
Give me your right number, 09... ?

602
01:01:20,375 --> 01:01:22,333
- 3, 4...
- 3, 4...

603
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:24,291
- 5, 6...
- 5, 6...

604
01:01:24,458 --> 01:01:25,833
Then 7?

605
01:01:26,583 --> 01:01:30,750
He screws us over,
then offers us coffee?

606
01:01:31,208 --> 01:01:34,666
No thanks, we don't want your coffee.

607
01:01:34,916 --> 01:01:37,708
Thank God he didn't call the cops.

608
01:01:37,875 --> 01:01:40,666
Let him call police!

609
01:01:41,083 --> 01:01:43,875
<i>Yes, I'm the King of Hashish...</i>

610
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:42,666
What is it?

611
01:02:42,833 --> 01:02:43,916
Do I look different?

612
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:07,041
Where are you going?

613
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:08,541
To call my mother.

614
01:04:08,708 --> 01:04:10,875
Then <i>Souk El Ahad</i>
to pick up a few things.

615
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:15,375
You're not alone, Zain is here.

616
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:21,500
See you later.

617
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:39,250
Goodbye, Zain.

618
01:04:39,875 --> 01:04:40,958
Bye.

619
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:09,791
I can't send any money this month.

620
01:05:11,041 --> 01:05:15,375
I'm taking English classes.

621
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,791
I'm sorry, mother.

622
01:05:22,958 --> 01:05:26,041
My boss lady is good to me.

623
01:05:28,166 --> 01:05:31,291
I'm ashamed to ask her for money.

624
01:05:32,666 --> 01:05:34,833
I love you, mom.

625
01:05:58,291 --> 01:05:59,208
Rahil?

626
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:03,166
Rahil?

627
01:06:06,666 --> 01:06:07,791
Rahil?

628
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:01,750
Manara?

629
01:07:01,916 --> 01:07:03,250
Yes, hop in.

630
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,916
I haven't seen her since yesterday.

631
01:07:15,083 --> 01:07:17,291
I thought she was sick.

632
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:21,333
She was going to the souk
but never came home.

633
01:07:21,708 --> 01:07:23,875
Maybe she went to Aspro's.

634
01:07:24,041 --> 01:07:26,375
Aspro? Who is Aspro?

635
01:07:26,541 --> 01:07:30,125
He has a stand at <i>Souk Al Ahad.</i>

636
01:07:47,875 --> 01:07:52,000
Pullovers for only 2000!

637
01:07:52,333 --> 01:07:54,125
Sir, where is Aspro's stand?

638
01:07:54,291 --> 01:07:56,416
Aspro? Over that way.

639
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:59,750
The real Aspro?

640
01:08:04,583 --> 01:08:05,833
Rahil?

641
01:08:06,458 --> 01:08:08,666
How do you know Rahil?

642
01:08:08,833 --> 01:08:11,041
- We're related.
- Related?

643
01:08:11,208 --> 01:08:12,333
Show me.

644
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:13,333
It's obvious.

645
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,875
Paternally or maternally?

646
01:08:16,583 --> 01:08:18,541
This is her son Yonas?

647
01:08:18,916 --> 01:08:20,166
Isn't it?

648
01:08:20,375 --> 01:08:22,375
Why is Yonas with you?

649
01:08:22,541 --> 01:08:24,708
Rahil left last night.

650
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:27,166
She hasn't returned.

651
01:08:27,333 --> 01:08:29,583
Give me Yonas.

652
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:31,250
- No, no...
- Why, are you afraid?

653
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:35,083
He's my little Yonas!
I'm all for him.

654
01:08:36,041 --> 01:08:38,875
He's a little scammer,
just like his mother.

655
01:08:39,333 --> 01:08:43,500
Yasser, 2 falafels
for these two rabbits!

656
01:08:44,166 --> 01:08:45,708
You want to eat?

657
01:08:47,916 --> 01:08:49,958
You haven't phoned her?

658
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:51,875
I don't have a phone.

659
01:08:58,291 --> 01:09:00,000
Her cellphone is off.

660
01:09:03,791 --> 01:09:06,166
Thanks, Yasser.

661
01:09:06,458 --> 01:09:09,083
- Come eat inside.
- No, thank you.

662
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:10,875
What do I say if she comes?

663
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:13,500
Say we're waiting at home.

664
01:09:13,666 --> 01:09:15,541
- Stay here.
- No, no.

665
01:09:15,708 --> 01:09:18,208
Wait here in case
she passes by.

666
01:09:39,541 --> 01:09:40,583
Excuse me?

667
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:42,583
Where can I open this?

668
01:09:44,333 --> 01:09:45,791
Hold this for me.

669
01:09:56,541 --> 01:09:57,791
- There.
- Thanks.

670
01:09:57,958 --> 01:09:58,791
No problem.

671
01:10:04,666 --> 01:10:06,958
- Are you hungry?
- No.

672
01:10:07,458 --> 01:10:08,458
Bon apptit.

673
01:10:09,041 --> 01:10:10,416
What's your name?

674
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:11,916
Ibrahim.

675
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,333
- What about him ?
- He's called...

676
01:10:15,666 --> 01:10:17,041
Assaad.

677
01:10:17,583 --> 01:10:19,666
- And you?
- Maysoun.

678
01:10:20,625 --> 01:10:23,500
You stole him? Or are you 
using him to beg for money?

679
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,291
He's my brother.

680
01:10:25,458 --> 01:10:26,958
You don't look alike.

681
01:10:27,125 --> 01:10:29,458
We're all born black like him.

682
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:30,791
And then...

683
01:10:30,958 --> 01:10:33,416
with time, we get lighter.

684
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,291
How much are these boxes?

685
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:39,500
It depends on the car.

686
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:41,625
If a woman drives by...

687
01:10:41,833 --> 01:10:45,083
Look at her hand,
if she's wearing a ring...

688
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:48,083
You say, "God protect you..."

689
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:50,125
"and keep your husband."

690
01:10:50,375 --> 01:10:52,625
If she has no ring,

691
01:10:52,791 --> 01:10:56,333
you say, "God send you a husband!"

692
01:10:56,875 --> 01:11:00,958
Stop licking your hands,
they're much too dirty.

693
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,958
Line-up over there, Ethiopians...

694
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:11,166
Are you pregnant?

695
01:12:14,791 --> 01:12:17,750
<i>You can't tell them.</i>

696
01:12:17,916 --> 01:12:19,833
<i>They'll take him from you.</i>

697
01:12:41,625 --> 01:12:44,541
Yonas, my son, forgive me!

698
01:12:44,958 --> 01:12:47,458
For the love of God forgive me!

699
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,208
Do you have something for a baby?

700
01:14:03,541 --> 01:14:04,458
Yes.

701
01:14:05,333 --> 01:14:06,583
How much?

702
01:14:07,166 --> 01:14:09,833
For 250 or one at 1000.

703
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
I'll take the 250.

704
01:15:09,708 --> 01:15:10,833
Taste.

705
01:15:14,208 --> 01:15:16,041
Just this once.

706
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:46,500
No kidding...

707
01:16:46,666 --> 01:16:49,541
Isn't this better than shawarma?

708
01:16:56,166 --> 01:16:58,916
Don't swallow it whole,
you'll get sick!


710
01:17:02,458 --> 01:17:04,041
You swallowed it?

711
01:17:56,750 --> 01:17:57,875
Is it good?

712
01:17:58,041 --> 01:17:59,750
Enjoy it, big guy.

713
01:18:27,791 --> 01:18:29,416
No water?

714
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:32,958
Fuck this shitty country!

715
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:38,500
She doesn't ask about her son?

716
01:18:38,666 --> 01:18:41,416
Doesn't look in on him?

717
01:18:41,875 --> 01:18:44,791
Your mother is worse than mine.

718
01:19:13,375 --> 01:19:15,375
After you, Mister Yonas.

719
01:19:15,541 --> 01:19:16,791
Go ahead.

720
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:34,958
Ibrahim!

721
01:19:36,541 --> 01:19:37,625
Ibrahim!

722
01:19:41,083 --> 01:19:42,041
Ibrahim!

723
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,541
What are you doing there?

724
01:19:46,708 --> 01:19:48,250
I'm selling these pots.

725
01:19:49,083 --> 01:19:51,208
Those crappy pots?

726
01:19:51,416 --> 01:19:55,375
Better than that stupid
wreath you're carrying!

727
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:57,250
That's for the cemetary, idiot.

728
01:19:57,458 --> 01:20:00,625
I could sell it easily.

729
01:20:00,916 --> 01:20:02,208
They'll buy it all.

730
01:20:02,916 --> 01:20:04,666
You want to bet?

731
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:06,916
Let's bet a plate of food.

732
01:20:07,333 --> 01:20:11,166
I want meat rolls 
with Chich Barak. You?

733
01:20:11,333 --> 01:20:15,041
I'd die for some Chich Barak, hot...

734
01:20:15,208 --> 01:20:16,541
My God...

735
01:20:16,708 --> 01:20:22,166
Not just any plate,
an enormous one...

736
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:25,208
Where does your
food relief come from?

737
01:20:25,708 --> 01:20:28,458
You talked about it last time.

738
01:20:28,666 --> 01:20:32,083
Ah, you mean the dispensary?

739
01:20:32,666 --> 01:20:33,708
Can I go with you?

740
01:20:33,875 --> 01:20:36,041
No, you're Lebanese, I'm Syrian.

741
01:20:36,208 --> 01:20:38,125
Where did you find that rabbit?

742
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:40,375
Mind your own business.

743
01:20:42,291 --> 01:20:45,333
- You old goat.
- Let's go.

744
01:20:45,791 --> 01:20:47,458
Could you move away?

745
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:51,041
- Or you want to taste my fist?
- Come, Ibrahim. Let's go.

746
01:20:53,083 --> 01:20:55,833
Anyhow, I'm leaving this country,
I'm outta here.

747
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:56,916
Where to?

748
01:20:57,083 --> 01:21:00,125
I'll leave you the business
and everything.

749
01:21:00,333 --> 01:21:01,791
It's all yours.

750
01:21:01,958 --> 01:21:03,458
Where are you going?

751
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:05,125
To Sweden.

752
01:21:05,541 --> 01:21:07,750
There's a neighborhood 
full of Syrians there.

753
01:21:07,916 --> 01:21:10,041
Nobody asks where you're from.

754
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:12,916
No hassles, nothing.

755
01:21:13,166 --> 01:21:15,166
I'll have my own room.

756
01:21:15,333 --> 01:21:19,166
Nobody enters without knocking.
I decide who comes in.

757
01:21:20,083 --> 01:21:23,458
Kids there die from natural causes.

758
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:25,916
I want to go with you.

759
01:21:26,083 --> 01:21:28,416
Sure, but you need money.

760
01:21:28,583 --> 01:21:29,750
How much?

761
01:21:30,125 --> 01:21:32,583
Around $300. Not much.

762
01:21:33,416 --> 01:21:35,125
$300 is a lot

763
01:21:35,333 --> 01:21:36,666
You know Os...

764
01:21:36,833 --> 01:21:38,125
Ospar?

765
01:21:38,666 --> 01:21:39,541
Aspro?

766
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,250
Yes, in the souk.

767
01:21:41,416 --> 01:21:42,583
What about him?

768
01:21:43,333 --> 01:21:44,875
This is his number.

769
01:21:46,083 --> 01:21:49,625
He sets up the trip.
He gave me this paper.

770
01:21:50,666 --> 01:21:53,166
I drew a boat beside his number.

771
01:21:55,083 --> 01:21:57,791
A boat with pretty lights,

772
01:21:57,958 --> 01:21:59,083
and great food.

773
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:01,083
Could Assaad come too?

774
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:03,916
Does he know how to swim?

775
01:22:04,208 --> 01:22:05,625
I'll help him.

776
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,125
I don't know.
We have to ask Ospro.

777
01:22:09,333 --> 01:22:11,166
Aspro, not Ospro.

778
01:22:12,291 --> 01:22:13,708
Aspro.

779
01:22:16,416 --> 01:22:18,291
Where are you from?

780
01:22:18,625 --> 01:22:19,916
(Syrian accent)
Where are you from?

781
01:22:20,083 --> 01:22:22,541
(Syrian accent)
Me? Syria.

782
01:22:22,708 --> 01:22:24,333
Where in Syria?

783
01:22:24,625 --> 01:22:25,958
Alep.

784
01:22:26,750 --> 01:22:29,291
- <i>This is your brother?</i>
- Yes, my brother.

785
01:22:29,458 --> 01:22:31,708
(Syrian accent)
I mean, this is my brother.

786
01:22:33,541 --> 01:22:35,416
What's his name?

787
01:22:35,833 --> 01:22:37,291
Nawras.

788
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:41,833
We haven't eaten for 2 days.

789
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:44,166
Why is he so black?

790
01:22:45,041 --> 01:22:49,166
My mother drank a lot of coffee
when she was pregnant.

791
01:22:49,333 --> 01:22:52,291
A whole coffeepot each day.

792
01:22:53,416 --> 01:22:55,250
Where is your card?

793
01:22:55,458 --> 01:23:00,208
I lost it walking near a river.

794
01:23:01,083 --> 01:23:03,333
You walked beside a river?

795
01:23:03,541 --> 01:23:06,166
Yes, and my papers fell in the water.

796
01:23:06,333 --> 01:23:09,166
I couldn't catch them.

797
01:23:09,333 --> 01:23:10,875
How did you get here?

798
01:23:11,041 --> 01:23:14,791
We were at home in Syria,
and our neighbor...

799
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:17,625
He denounced us, I think.

800
01:23:17,833 --> 01:23:20,041
I'm not certain...

801
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:21,666
But I suspect him.

802
01:23:21,833 --> 01:23:23,916
A shell fell on our house.

803
01:23:24,125 --> 01:23:26,208
We started moving like Rambo.

804
01:23:26,375 --> 01:23:27,666
Rambo, who keeps moving.

805
01:23:27,833 --> 01:23:29,041
You started moving?

806
01:23:29,208 --> 01:23:31,625
Yes, like him, in the trenches.

807
01:23:32,208 --> 01:23:34,541
So what do you want?

808
01:23:34,708 --> 01:23:38,750
Whatever you can give.
Milk and diapers, mostly.

809
01:23:38,916 --> 01:23:40,416
Milk and diapers.

810
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,500
Maybe some ramen
and some vinegar chips.

811
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:55,916
Stand up.

812
01:23:58,375 --> 01:24:00,833
What are you looking at?
Stand up.

813
01:24:27,083 --> 01:24:29,625
What a Lamborghini!
Come here, let me see that.

814
01:24:30,583 --> 01:24:32,291
Rahil hasn't come back?

815
01:24:32,458 --> 01:24:33,333
No...

816
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,666
I mean, yes! Rahil?

817
01:24:35,833 --> 01:24:37,375
She came back a while ago!

818
01:24:37,541 --> 01:24:38,375
For sure...

819
01:24:38,583 --> 01:24:40,666
What are you dragging behind you?

820
01:24:40,833 --> 01:24:43,166
A nuclear bomb,
or a rocket?

821
01:24:43,333 --> 01:24:45,625
A brand new water tank.

822
01:24:45,833 --> 01:24:48,916
How much for that
"brand new" water tank?

823
01:24:49,125 --> 01:24:51,250
- 20000.
- 20000?

824
01:24:53,333 --> 01:24:54,541
Yasser!

825
01:24:55,458 --> 01:24:58,458
Give the kid 30000 instead of 20.

826
01:24:59,625 --> 01:25:00,875
Yonas...

827
01:25:01,041 --> 01:25:02,583
Why is Yonas so thin?

828
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:04,833
You're not eating?

829
01:25:05,208 --> 01:25:06,875
He looks sick.

830
01:25:07,541 --> 01:25:10,750
My God you smell like dogs!

831
01:25:12,375 --> 01:25:14,500
I already spoke to Rahil.

832
01:25:14,666 --> 01:25:17,708
I told her a family
would take care of Yonas.

833
01:25:17,875 --> 01:25:19,833
They'll care for him,
buy him clothing...

834
01:25:20,666 --> 01:25:24,416
And you can put $500
in your pockets.

835
01:25:24,958 --> 01:25:26,250
Sound good?

836
01:25:26,791 --> 01:25:27,625
So?

837
01:25:28,166 --> 01:25:31,958
They say you help people
travel to Turkey?

838
01:25:32,833 --> 01:25:34,333
You want to travel?

839
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:35,833
I'd like to.

840
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,500
Where do you want to go?

841
01:25:37,708 --> 01:25:38,875
Turkey.

842
01:25:39,083 --> 01:25:40,125
I mean Sweden.

843
01:25:40,833 --> 01:25:44,666
- Sweden, Turkey, wherever you like.
- Which is nicer?

844
01:25:45,541 --> 01:25:47,916
You choose,
I can get you to the moon.

845
01:25:48,083 --> 01:25:50,625
Just convince Rahil
about this boy.

846
01:25:51,833 --> 01:25:53,375
Alright, kid?

847
01:25:53,666 --> 01:25:55,041
Here, boss.

848
01:25:57,291 --> 01:26:01,166
Take this and tell Rahil
that Aspro says hello.

849
01:26:01,583 --> 01:26:02,416
Alright?

850
01:26:03,416 --> 01:26:04,708
I'll ask Rahil.

851
01:26:04,875 --> 01:26:06,041
You do that.

852
01:26:40,708 --> 01:26:42,958
Yonas, give me a clothespin.

853
01:26:50,750 --> 01:26:53,208
Do like this to warm your hands.

854
01:27:07,083 --> 01:27:11,375
My little sister washed her pants
because our mother was sick.

855
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,833
She washed the prescription
with the clothing?

856
01:27:18,083 --> 01:27:20,000
I'll give you one card...

857
01:27:20,833 --> 01:27:25,000
You get the rest when you
pay the missing 3000.

858
01:27:25,166 --> 01:27:27,750
One card?
Give me two.

859
01:27:53,250 --> 01:27:54,250
No.

860
01:28:04,458 --> 01:28:05,833
Stay back!

861
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:09,166
I see you moving forward.
I'm not blind.

862
01:28:27,833 --> 01:28:30,916
Guys, can you come help me?

863
01:28:34,833 --> 01:28:37,708
Gulps of Tramadol,
are you into that?

864
01:28:38,291 --> 01:28:39,916
One gulp for 1000.

865
01:28:40,208 --> 01:28:42,500
Help me carry all this.

866
01:28:44,041 --> 01:28:45,625
Come help me!

867
01:28:47,875 --> 01:28:50,416
I'll give you a good price, brother.

868
01:28:51,125 --> 01:28:53,625
Come on, hurry!

869
01:28:53,958 --> 01:28:55,083
Guys, he has Tramadol!

870
01:28:56,041 --> 01:28:59,791
- Tramadol by the gulp.
- Can you get Viagra or Simo?

871
01:29:00,166 --> 01:29:02,375
- Do you have Rivo?
- Farawla, Tradamol?

872
01:29:02,541 --> 01:29:04,208
- Freebase?
- I'm in the juice business.

873
01:29:04,416 --> 01:29:07,458
This is Rivo, but in juice form.

874
01:29:10,833 --> 01:29:12,625
You selling us sea water ,
little man?

875
01:29:12,833 --> 01:29:14,791
Nothing better than sea water!

876
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,541
I have Tramadol by the gulp.
Interested?

877
01:29:26,416 --> 01:29:27,708
1000 for a swig.

878
01:29:35,083 --> 01:29:38,208
Go on, choose your dream country.

879
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:42,875
Let's go to Sweden, it's nicer.

880
01:29:43,208 --> 01:29:45,541
We'll go with that fool Maysoun.

881
01:29:46,125 --> 01:29:47,875
In Sweden,

882
01:29:48,708 --> 01:29:51,166
nobody ever bothers you.

883
01:29:51,333 --> 01:29:55,875
You can even piss from the balcony,
and nobody says a thing!

884
01:30:04,875 --> 01:30:07,125
Pay what you owe him, bitch !

885
01:30:07,666 --> 01:30:09,750
Take your doll and get out!

886
01:30:09,916 --> 01:30:11,083
I'm going, asshole!

887
01:30:11,291 --> 01:30:14,416
Go heat up your ass,
when it's well-cooked, eat it!

888
01:30:15,416 --> 01:30:16,875
Don't touch the kid, shithead.

889
01:30:17,541 --> 01:30:19,125
Get out!

890
01:30:22,958 --> 01:30:25,083
Bugger off!

891
01:30:26,666 --> 01:30:28,625
Get out!

892
01:31:39,416 --> 01:31:42,125
You'll break the door!
What are you doing?

893
01:31:42,333 --> 01:31:46,458
Who's the son of a whore that changed
the lock and threw my things out?

894
01:31:46,666 --> 01:31:49,583
Your things are right there.
Who are you?

895
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:51,458
I have things inside.

896
01:31:51,625 --> 01:31:53,416
Your things are at the owners.

897
01:31:53,625 --> 01:31:55,291
Where is this stupid owner?

898
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:58,166
Go find your slutty friend.

899
01:31:58,333 --> 01:32:00,250
Or else I'll call the owner.

900
01:32:00,458 --> 01:32:04,125
Give him a big kiss for me!

901
01:32:04,291 --> 01:32:06,875
How do you know that slut?

902
01:32:07,041 --> 01:32:08,041
I'm her brother.

903
01:32:08,208 --> 01:32:10,208
What shithole did you come from?

904
01:32:10,416 --> 01:32:14,208
Bug off before I go crazy!

905
01:32:16,583 --> 01:32:18,375
I'm calling the cops!

906
01:32:18,833 --> 01:32:20,000
You'll see!

907
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:25,708
If I don't break the door,
where is that dumb owner?

908
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,958
Get away or I'll break you in two!

909
01:32:30,166 --> 01:32:32,958
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Go away!

910
01:32:35,041 --> 01:32:40,791
I. Want. My. Fucking. Money!

911
01:33:32,375 --> 01:33:34,625
Stay here.
Don't move.

912
01:33:51,625 --> 01:33:53,125
Go over there!

913
01:34:22,666 --> 01:34:23,791
Go.

914
01:34:24,708 --> 01:34:26,000
Go back!

915
01:34:26,166 --> 01:34:27,333
Go over there!

916
01:34:39,958 --> 01:34:41,166
Go over there!

917
01:36:32,750 --> 01:36:34,250
Yes, my friend.

918
01:36:34,708 --> 01:36:35,666
Listen...

919
01:36:35,833 --> 01:36:38,291
I'm sending you a small kid.

920
01:36:38,708 --> 01:36:42,291
He looks like a dog now,
make him look human.

921
01:36:42,458 --> 01:36:44,375
OK? I have to bring him?

922
01:36:45,250 --> 01:36:46,583
Alright.

923
01:36:47,541 --> 01:36:48,375
Why are you sad?

924
01:36:48,583 --> 01:36:49,750
It's nothing.

925
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,625
It's a good thing. We agreed.

926
01:36:51,791 --> 01:36:53,500
You have his papers?

927
01:36:54,083 --> 01:36:55,291
Identity card?

928
01:36:55,458 --> 01:36:56,916
Don't know.
At the house, maybe.

929
01:36:57,416 --> 01:36:59,416
I need proof you exist.

930
01:36:59,583 --> 01:37:01,750
An identity card, government papers,

931
01:37:01,916 --> 01:37:04,125
a newspaper photograph...

932
01:37:04,291 --> 01:37:07,708
So I can get you out by
the port in Beirut.

933
01:37:07,916 --> 01:37:09,041
Understand?

934
01:37:09,291 --> 01:37:10,916
Don't worry about Yonas.

935
01:37:11,083 --> 01:37:13,500
I love him, he'll go to a good family.

936
01:37:13,708 --> 01:37:17,458
The people you'll travel with
will take good care of you.

937
01:37:17,625 --> 01:37:21,083
Remember Yasser who works for me?
Go see him...

938
01:37:21,583 --> 01:37:23,416
He'll send you for a haircut.

939
01:37:23,583 --> 01:37:25,083
Then go home and bring...what?

940
01:37:25,291 --> 01:37:26,916
- Papers.
- Papers.

941
01:37:27,083 --> 01:37:28,166
Alright?

942
01:37:28,375 --> 01:37:31,416
Here's one, two, three, four...

943
01:37:31,875 --> 01:37:33,166
Here.

944
01:37:33,333 --> 01:37:34,958
You promised $500.

945
01:37:35,166 --> 01:37:37,833
You want to eat and drink for free?

946
01:37:38,041 --> 01:37:40,666
$100 for your food

947
01:37:41,625 --> 01:37:42,916
Kiss me.

948
01:37:43,333 --> 01:37:46,291
Take care now, go on.

949
01:38:01,083 --> 01:38:03,375
It's alright, you can go

950
01:38:03,625 --> 01:38:06,583
I said I'd take care of him.

951
01:39:58,291 --> 01:39:59,416
Zain!

952
01:40:01,291 --> 01:40:03,125
How long have you been here?

953
01:40:03,583 --> 01:40:05,166
None of your business.

954
01:40:05,791 --> 01:40:07,458
Where have you been?

955
01:40:07,916 --> 01:40:10,625
Where have you been?

956
01:40:10,958 --> 01:40:12,208
Where have you been?

957
01:40:12,375 --> 01:40:14,750
Where? Where? Where?

958
01:40:15,958 --> 01:40:17,416
I curse you!

959
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:21,500
Anyhow, I didn't come to see you,

960
01:40:21,666 --> 01:40:23,666
nor for that asshole over there.

961
01:40:23,833 --> 01:40:27,250
- I want my papers.
- Yes, of course my dear!

962
01:40:27,416 --> 01:40:31,541
Selim, want to hear a good one?
Your son wants his papers!

963
01:40:31,708 --> 01:40:33,333
Where are my papers?

964
01:40:33,750 --> 01:40:35,791
Where were you all this time?

965
01:40:35,958 --> 01:40:37,541
None of your business.

966
01:40:37,708 --> 01:40:39,208
Not my business?

967
01:40:39,791 --> 01:40:41,666
Why do you want your papers?

968
01:40:42,541 --> 01:40:44,083
Found work as a garbageman?

969
01:40:44,750 --> 01:40:47,791
My papers, my identity card,
whatever!

970
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:52,125
Nobody cares
about you or us.

971
01:40:52,333 --> 01:40:56,625
Don't play tough with me!

972
01:40:57,291 --> 01:40:59,708
You'll see, I'll 
give you your papers.

973
01:41:07,416 --> 01:41:10,916
I have all kinds of papers.
Just choose any.

974
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,625
I have papers that
would jail me for life.

975
01:41:17,416 --> 01:41:20,750
Expulsion notice.

976
01:41:21,916 --> 01:41:23,833
This one. The most important.

977
01:41:24,458 --> 01:41:27,916
Come.
Look at this paper!

978
01:41:29,250 --> 01:41:33,666
A hospital bill
that breaks my heart.

979
01:41:34,541 --> 01:41:37,500
We're less than nothing, my son.

980
01:41:37,666 --> 01:41:39,375
Parasites.

981
01:41:39,541 --> 01:41:43,333
Just live without papers...

982
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:47,083
Or I'll toss you from the window,
and end it all.

983
01:41:47,541 --> 01:41:48,916
You understand?

984
01:41:50,250 --> 01:41:53,375
Get out or I'll break your face.

985
01:41:54,125 --> 01:41:54,958
Let him go, Selim !

986
01:41:55,125 --> 01:42:00,666
Tell whoever sent you
I never got you papers!

987
01:42:01,666 --> 01:42:03,833
Go back where you came from!

988
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:07,166
I curse you and the day
you were born!

989
01:42:07,375 --> 01:42:09,375
Who's in the hospital?

990
01:42:12,416 --> 01:42:15,250
Not a word Selim,
don't say any more!

991
01:42:15,625 --> 01:42:17,750
Who went to the hospital?

992
01:42:19,250 --> 01:42:21,250
Who went to the hospital?

993
01:42:21,583 --> 01:42:23,333
Who's in the hospital?

994
01:42:24,166 --> 01:42:27,083
Make him leave or I'll kill him!

995
01:42:30,791 --> 01:42:33,208
- Piece of garbage!
- Who was in the hospital?

996
01:42:34,666 --> 01:42:37,791
- Troublemaker!
- Who went to the hospital?

997
01:42:38,708 --> 01:42:39,541
Talk to me.

998
01:42:39,708 --> 01:42:41,666
Who was in the hospital?

999
01:42:50,416 --> 01:42:53,666
What did he do,
that son of a whore?

1000
01:42:54,250 --> 01:42:56,000
What did he do to her?

1001
01:42:56,666 --> 01:42:58,708
What did he do?

1002
01:42:59,333 --> 01:43:01,666
Sahar is gone.
It's over.

1003
01:43:03,750 --> 01:43:05,583
She's gone?

1004
01:43:06,458 --> 01:43:09,375
She's gone?
You'll see what going means.

1005
01:43:11,958 --> 01:43:14,416
I'll show you what it means.

1006
01:43:14,625 --> 01:43:17,583
- Come back, little shit!
- He has a knife!

1007
01:43:17,750 --> 01:43:20,625
Come back, or I'll smash your face!

1008
01:43:20,833 --> 01:43:22,916
Come back you dog!

1009
01:43:23,916 --> 01:43:26,125
With my bare hands!

1010
01:44:11,250 --> 01:44:12,958
Take his handcuffs off.

1011
01:45:17,291 --> 01:45:18,791
You're the husband of...

1012
01:45:18,958 --> 01:45:20,625
- Sahar.
- Sahar.

1013
01:45:20,916 --> 01:45:22,625
How old was she when you married?

1014
01:45:22,791 --> 01:45:24,958
- 11.
- 11 years old?

1015
01:45:27,375 --> 01:45:30,083
Is an 11 year old of age to marry?

1016
01:45:30,250 --> 01:45:31,791
She knows what marriage means?

1017
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:35,583
From what I know...

1018
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:38,500
Yes, she can.

1019
01:45:38,791 --> 01:45:41,250
I mean she had ripened.

1020
01:45:41,416 --> 01:45:42,250
Really?

1021
01:45:42,416 --> 01:45:45,750
Didn't know she was a tomato
or potato to become ripe!

1022
01:45:45,916 --> 01:45:48,333
Zain, calm down!

1023
01:45:49,291 --> 01:45:54,208
I didn't know she could die from it.

1024
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:58,666
Many girls here marry at that age.

1025
01:45:58,833 --> 01:46:03,041
Even my step-mother
married at that age.

1026
01:46:03,208 --> 01:46:05,833
She's here, still alive.

1027
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:10,333
When did she get pregnant?

1028
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:12,250
2 or 3 months after.

1029
01:46:12,458 --> 01:46:14,291
Everything was normal?

1030
01:46:14,458 --> 01:46:16,875
At first, I didn't notice anything wrong.

1031
01:46:17,041 --> 01:46:18,291
Then she started to bleed.

1032
01:46:18,500 --> 01:46:20,375
She bled a lot.

1033
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:23,875
What happened next?

1034
01:46:24,375 --> 01:46:27,375
They brought her to hospital
with her parents.

1035
01:46:27,583 --> 01:46:30,250
She died at the entrance.

1036
01:46:30,416 --> 01:46:32,916
We couldn't get her admitted.

1037
01:46:37,375 --> 01:46:40,666
Why did they refuse to admit her?

1038
01:46:41,083 --> 01:46:43,500
Because she has no papers.

1039
01:46:43,958 --> 01:46:47,750
That's enough, you're
besieging her with questions.

1040
01:46:48,291 --> 01:46:51,958
I've been a slave all my life
and you dare question me?

1041
01:46:52,208 --> 01:46:55,541
How dare you judge me?
Have you walked in my shoes?

1042
01:46:55,708 --> 01:46:57,000
Have you lived what I've lived?

1043
01:46:57,166 --> 01:46:59,583
No, never,
you'll never have to go through it!

1044
01:46:59,750 --> 01:47:02,000
Not even in your worst nightmares.

1045
01:47:02,208 --> 01:47:04,250
In my place,
you would have hung yourself!

1046
01:47:05,458 --> 01:47:08,791
Imagine feeding your kids sugar water,

1047
01:47:08,958 --> 01:47:11,500
because you have nothing else.

1048
01:47:11,708 --> 01:47:14,666
I'd commit 100 crimes
to keep my children alive!

1049
01:47:14,833 --> 01:47:16,291
They're my children.

1050
01:47:16,458 --> 01:47:19,666
Nobody has a right to judge me.
I am my own judge.

1051
01:47:19,833 --> 01:47:21,791
The flesh of my flesh!

1052
01:47:22,541 --> 01:47:24,166
Do you hear me?

1053
01:47:35,583 --> 01:47:38,541
The Syrian, Hussein...

1054
01:47:39,458 --> 01:47:41,333
The Egyptian, Mohammad...

1055
01:47:56,250 --> 01:47:58,708
Could we have your attention?

1056
01:47:58,875 --> 01:48:02,166
We're here with the priest,
to get to know you.

1057
01:48:02,750 --> 01:48:08,083
To have some good times with you.

1058
01:48:08,416 --> 01:48:11,333
To help pick up your spirits.

1059
01:48:11,625 --> 01:48:14,125
Let's sing a song.

1060
01:49:54,500 --> 01:50:01,083
<i>Zain Al Hajj, get your things
and report to the office.</i>

1061
01:50:18,333 --> 01:50:19,166
Zain?

1062
01:50:19,333 --> 01:50:20,166
Zain?

1063
01:50:21,041 --> 01:50:22,083
Zain?

1064
01:50:22,250 --> 01:50:23,208
Zain!

1065
01:50:24,708 --> 01:50:25,625
Zain!

1066
01:50:25,791 --> 01:50:27,958
What are you doing here?

1067
01:50:28,708 --> 01:50:30,291
Zain, where is Yonas?

1068
01:50:31,208 --> 01:50:32,458
Zain!

1069
01:50:32,958 --> 01:50:35,333
Zain, where is Yonas ?

1070
01:50:36,458 --> 01:50:37,541
Zain!

1071
01:50:37,750 --> 01:50:39,000
Where is my son?

1072
01:50:39,166 --> 01:50:41,750
Where is Yonas? Where?

1073
01:50:43,125 --> 01:50:45,833
Who did you leave him with?

1074
01:50:49,291 --> 01:50:51,875
My son is alone!

1075
01:50:56,125 --> 01:50:57,625
His eye...

1076
01:50:57,791 --> 01:50:58,875
on this side,

1077
01:50:59,208 --> 01:51:01,000
is blue, blue, blue.

1078
01:51:02,583 --> 01:51:07,666
- Both his eyes are blue ?
- No. One eye is brown.

1079
01:51:07,833 --> 01:51:10,000
And one is blue.

1080
01:51:31,125 --> 01:51:33,416
<i>You are live on </i>Freedom Forever.

1081
01:51:33,583 --> 01:51:36,083
<i>Please lower the volume
on your television set.</i>

1082
01:51:37,416 --> 01:51:42,041
<i>I've watched your show
for a while now...</i>

1083
01:51:42,208 --> 01:51:47,458
<i>I know you always
tackle social problems...</i>

1084
01:52:21,541 --> 01:52:22,708
How are you?

1085
01:52:30,166 --> 01:52:31,791
Are you sick?
Did you catch cold?

1086
01:52:32,458 --> 01:52:35,125
Congratulations, your mourning is over?

1087
01:52:35,708 --> 01:52:37,875
No longer wearing black?

1088
01:52:42,625 --> 01:52:45,666
I brought you candy to munch on.

1089
01:52:46,833 --> 01:52:48,458
Eat them, Zain.

1090
01:52:50,958 --> 01:52:54,375
Why do you hate me so much?

1091
01:52:54,791 --> 01:52:57,333
I'm powerless.
I couldn't do anything.

1092
01:52:58,125 --> 01:53:00,750
She was my daughter,
it's my pain.

1093
01:53:00,958 --> 01:53:02,916
Why are you here?

1094
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:08,916
When God takes something,

1095
01:53:09,083 --> 01:53:11,791
He offers something in return.

1096
01:53:13,250 --> 01:53:15,416
What did he offer you?

1097
01:53:18,958 --> 01:53:20,541
I'm pregnant.

1098
01:53:22,083 --> 01:53:24,625
You'll have a brother or sister.

1099
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:28,291
I feel sick.

1100
01:53:28,458 --> 01:53:31,958
I hope it's a girl.
We'll name her Zahar.

1101
01:53:32,291 --> 01:53:35,125
Your words pierce my heart.

1102
01:53:35,333 --> 01:53:40,875
When you get out,
she'll be walking, and playing...

1103
01:53:41,250 --> 01:53:43,916
I no longer want to see you.

1104
01:53:44,791 --> 01:53:46,916
You're heartless.

1105
01:53:51,041 --> 01:53:54,083
Leave me alone, I want to leave.

1106
01:54:00,625 --> 01:54:05,000
<i>Since my father died
I haven't smiled...</i>

1107
01:54:07,250 --> 01:54:11,208
<i>This report on injustices
against children</i>

1108
01:54:11,375 --> 01:54:14,541
<i>has deeply touched
our audience.</i>

1109
01:54:17,250 --> 01:54:19,916
<i>If you'd like to comment
on what you've just watched...</i>

1110
01:54:20,083 --> 01:54:22,833
<i>09658856.</i>

1111
01:54:32,333 --> 01:54:35,458
<i>Is there an adult
next to you, Zain ?</i>

1112
01:54:36,791 --> 01:54:38,083
An officer.

1113
01:54:38,958 --> 01:54:40,291
<i>An officer?</i>

1114
01:54:40,791 --> 01:54:42,458
<i>Where are you calling from, Zain ?</i>

1115
01:54:43,541 --> 01:54:44,916
<i>From prison.</i>

1116
01:54:45,333 --> 01:54:46,500
I hear Zain's voice.

1117
01:54:46,708 --> 01:54:48,083
<i>From prison?</i>

1118
01:54:49,625 --> 01:54:50,791
<i>Which prison?</i>

1119
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:52,458
It's him!

1120
01:54:52,666 --> 01:54:54,958
<i>Roumieh Prison for Minors.</i>

1121
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:01,041
<i>Zain, why are you calling?
What can I do for you?</i>

1122
01:55:03,541 --> 01:55:06,208
<i>I want to make a complaint
against my parents.</i>

1123
01:55:08,375 --> 01:55:09,625
Hey boys!

1124
01:55:09,958 --> 01:55:12,500
Zain is on television!

1125
01:55:27,333 --> 01:55:30,458
Zain, you're on live.
What would you like to say?

1126
01:55:33,125 --> 01:55:36,083
<i>I'd want adults to listen to me.</i>

1127
01:55:36,250 --> 01:55:40,541
<i>I want adults who can't
raise kids not to have any.</i>

1128
01:55:41,291 --> 01:55:43,208
<i>What will I remember?</i>

1129
01:55:43,375 --> 01:55:47,125
<i>Violence, insults or beatings,</i>

1130
01:55:47,416 --> 01:55:50,250
<i>hit with chains, pipes, or a belt?</i>

1131
01:55:51,083 --> 01:55:54,458
<i>The kindest words I heard
were "get out son of a whore!"</i>

1132
01:55:54,625 --> 01:55:56,666
<i>"Bug off, piece of garbage!"</i>

1133
01:55:58,875 --> 01:56:01,125
<i>Life is a pile of shit.</i>

1134
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:03,791
<i>Not worth more than my shoe.</i>

1135
01:56:07,458 --> 01:56:09,708
<i>I live in hell here.</i>

1136
01:56:10,166 --> 01:56:13,041
<i>I burn like rotting meat.</i>

1137
01:56:13,375 --> 01:56:14,791
How are you?

1138
01:56:17,875 --> 01:56:19,833
<i>Life is a bitch.</i>

1139
01:56:21,416 --> 01:56:26,208
<i>I thought we'd become good people,</i>

1140
01:56:26,958 --> 01:56:29,375
<i>loved by all.</i>

1141
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:33,958
<i>But God doesn't
want that for us.</i>

1142
01:56:35,875 --> 01:56:39,500
<i>He'd rather we be washrags for others.</i>

1143
01:56:45,958 --> 01:56:48,500
The child you're carrying
will be like I am.

1144
01:56:54,208 --> 01:56:56,791
Zain, what do you want
from you parents?

1145
01:56:57,500 --> 01:57:00,166
I want them to stop having kids.

1146
01:57:00,583 --> 01:57:01,625
Louder.

1147
01:57:01,791 --> 01:57:04,250
I want them to stop having kids.

1148
01:57:04,458 --> 01:57:05,916
You want them to stop having kids.

1149
01:57:06,083 --> 01:57:07,000
Yes.

1150
01:57:08,541 --> 01:57:11,166
I don't think they'll have more kids.

1151
01:57:11,333 --> 01:57:13,291
And the one in her tummy?

1152
01:57:17,250 --> 01:57:19,166
It will be born, no?

1153
01:57:47,750 --> 01:57:53,500
<i>We've discovered a depot
where 15 people were sequestered...</i>

1154
01:59:26,666 --> 01:59:27,875
Toes on the line.

1155
01:59:31,125 --> 01:59:32,875
A little to the right.

1156
01:59:33,208 --> 01:59:34,791
No, the left.

1157
01:59:35,291 --> 01:59:36,958
I mean your right.

1158
01:59:39,666 --> 01:59:41,041
But this is my right.

1159
01:59:41,208 --> 01:59:42,875
And this is my left.

1160
01:59:45,916 --> 01:59:47,541
Lift your chin.

1161
01:59:49,291 --> 01:59:51,291
Look straight ahead.

1162
01:59:52,958 --> 01:59:54,041
Smile.

1163
01:59:54,916 --> 01:59:56,875
Smile, Zain.

1164
01:59:57,041 --> 02:00:00,291
It's a passeport photo,
not a death certificate!
