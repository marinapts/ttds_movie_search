Sir?

13
00:09:24,218 --> 00:09:25,218
Kilang.

14
00:09:28,644 --> 00:09:30,068
Kilang is a protector.

15
00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:37,186
Because there are professional shooters
The situation is even harder.

16
00:09:37,913 --> 00:09:39,288
We must be twice as careful.

17
00:09:39,374 --> 00:09:40,774
Sir!
Should we wait for backup team?

18
00:09:43,525 --> 00:09:44,525
Negative.

19
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,121
It will take morning
for them to reach here.

20
00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:49,059
We will lose the element of surprise.

21
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,371
And maybe
we wont get this chance again.

22
00:09:52,082 --> 00:09:54,590
When all the terrorists
from Nagaland and Manipur

23
00:09:54,941 --> 00:09:56,457

From the left and right
and I am in charge.

27
00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:06,509
And the other commandos
are moving straight.

28
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,746
If someone left our siege area
You are in the veil.

29
00:10:09,957 --> 00:10:11,746
Not even one terrorist should
escape.

00:10:12,983 --> 00:10:13,983

Thank you Sir.

According to intelligence the rest of

After the Special Forces mission

68
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,927
the enemy other than accepting settlement

69
00:16:50,099 --> 00:16:51,423
don't have any other way.

Vihan!

71
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:55,409
Arjun Ji was saying that
you applied for a premature retirement

72
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:57,805
on compassionate grounds?

73
00:16:58,054 --> 00:16:59,165
- Why?
- What has happened?

74
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,980

00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:11,151
She is forgetting everything slowly.

78
00:17:11,205 --> 00:17:13,415
And not feeling well these days.

79
00:17:13,728 --> 00:17:15,488
My posting is in eastern command.

80
00:17:15,814 --> 00:17:18,075
And she lives her in Delhi
with my sister

81
00:17:20,358 --> 00:17:22,454
before she forgets me as well

82
00:17:22,712 --> 00:17:24,581
I want to spend some time with her

83
00:17:24,987 --> 00:17:25,987
good job.

84
00:17:26,891 --> 00:17:29,211
You are a good son that you want to
Take care of your mom.

85
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:32,566
But protection of the
country is also necessary.

86
00:17:33,113 --> 00:17:34,113
She is mother too!

87
00:17:37,217 --> 00:17:38,929
Is there any other way

88
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,261
other than retirement?

89
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,058
There is a way.

90
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:45,621
If you are transferred to

91
00:17:45,777 --> 00:17:47,305
Delhi army office.

92
00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:51,191
You'll stay close to your mother

93
00:17:51,449 --> 00:17:52,449

Yes Sir.

100
00:18:05,905 --> 00:18:06,905
Let's go.

101
00:18:07,693 --> 00:18:09,251
You start your dinner

102
00:18:09,407 --> 00:18:10,961
I'm sure you're hungry.

103
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,064
No matter how many times
you read this report.

104
00:18:35,335 --> 00:18:37,112
Nothing is going to change.

105
00:18:40,711 --> 00:18:42,993
I have only one request.

106
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:48,457
When my sickness gets severe.

107
00:18:49,074 --> 00:18:51,376
Please don't leave me alone in hospital.

108
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,549
Mommy.

109
00:18:54,664 --> 00:18:56,923
No one is going to put you in hospital

110
00:18:59,468 --> 00:19:01,965
I'm afraid of being alone.

111
00:19:02,035 --> 00:19:03,117
Come on, take medicine

112
00:19:05,459 --> 00:19:06,459

00:19:21,524 --> 00:19:22,553
- Mommy.
- Mom!

117
00:19:27,496 --> 00:19:29,288

120
00:19:34,353 --> 00:19:35,954
I know you are trying your best.

121
00:19:35,993 --> 00:19:36,993
Mom!

122
00:19:37,457 --> 00:19:38,457
Eat the medicines.

124
00:19:49,996 --> 00:19:50,934
Hi uncle.

125
00:19:50,985 --> 00:19:53,796
Why did you take so
long to open the door.

126
00:19:54,199 --> 00:19:56,496
These are all the mom's clothes.

127
00:19:56,668 --> 00:19:59,121
Only books are left
I'll bring them later.

128

131
00:20:02,718 --> 00:20:03,746
Sitting in her room.

132
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:06,809
- Uncle.
- Yes?

133
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:08,748
At what age did you get black belt?

134
00:20:09,579 --> 00:20:10,789
Sixteen!

In some years

Then you need to be careful
around me!

139
00:20:18,557 --> 00:20:20,716
Don't try to make me angry.

So what are you going to do
after the black belt? Ms. Karate.

141
00:20:24,881 --> 00:20:27,651
First like uncle
I'll be an army officer.

142

Then I will be the first
female general of India.

Wanna be uncle!
Your father is joker right?

00:20:34,226 --> 00:20:36,106
You don't consider him a officer right?

146
00:20:36,284 --> 00:20:37,284
Suahana.

147
00:20:37,339 --> 00:20:38,692
Go get the scissors.

He's tiring himself in
order to throw you a party.

151
00:20:45,573 --> 00:20:48,159
My house looks like 8-10
grenades blew up

152
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:49,448

He came today.

161
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,244
He wanted to surprise you.

162
00:21:11,002 --> 00:21:12,746
Vacations for how many days?

I'm so hungry.

171
00:21:32,062 --> 00:21:33,062
Uncle!

172
00:21:33,556 --> 00:21:34,556
Let's go?

173
00:21:37,373 --> 00:21:39,103
Uncle-
Yes?-

174
00:21:39,128 --> 00:21:42,279
Daddy taught me the war
cry of your battalion.

175
00:21:42,358 --> 00:21:43,358
Really?

176
00:21:43,383 --> 00:21:44,383
Tell me.

177
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,115

179
00:21:52,193 --> 00:21:53,593
War cry this cold?

180
00:21:53,925 --> 00:21:55,413
When you scream the war cry.

181
00:21:55,929 --> 00:21:58,458
The energy of the troop must get high.

182
00:21:58,552 --> 00:22:00,794
Enemies must get fearful
pee in their pants.

183
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:02,254
That's the real war cry

184
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,130
and for breakfast

185
00:22:04,247 --> 00:22:06,065

186
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,926
Don't eat green leafs like your mom.

187
00:22:08,887 --> 00:22:09,887
Go change.

00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:15,709
Sartaj?

190
00:22:16,696 --> 00:22:17,953
Today was your date right?

191
00:22:17,977 --> 00:22:18,977
You didn't go?

192
00:22:22,877 --> 00:22:23,877
Wait, you don't know?

193
00:22:23,908 --> 00:22:24,908
What has happened?

194
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:27,404
He got completely ready

195
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:31,783
to leave using Armani perfume and suit then
he got a text from his girlfriend.

196
00:22:32,528 --> 00:22:35,912
That I'm tired from this relationship,
I'm breaking up with you. It's over

197
00:22:36,771 --> 00:22:38,681
I'm really sorry, I didn't know.

198
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:39,719
Listen first.

199
00:22:40,386 --> 00:22:42,226
In a few minutes,
my lady sent a message again.

200
00:22:42,996 --> 00:22:44,231
Sorry, baby

201
00:22:44,349 --> 00:22:46,673

How are you going to
do staff work in Delhi?

205
00:23:08,275 --> 00:23:11,114
Person like you will get crazy
doing staff work in south hall.

206
00:23:11,841 --> 00:23:14,711
Till today your planning in any mission
was never gone wrong Sir.

207
00:23:15,242 --> 00:23:17,896
Your real need is on border Sir
Not in Delhi.

208
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:28,172
Look Bro.

209
00:23:29,388 --> 00:23:31,400
Every soldier has to
do this job as well.

210
00:23:32,518 --> 00:23:34,805
An you both know this
I have to do this.

211
00:23:38,644 --> 00:23:41,295
Don't get sad now, come on

212
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:55,840
Mother's reports came in?

213
00:23:57,341 --> 00:23:58,341
Yeah.

214
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,083
It's spreading aggressively.

215
00:24:13,281 --> 00:24:14,552
Enjoy everyone.

216
00:24:16,472 --> 00:24:17,472

Here's your drink!

218
00:24:18,646 --> 00:24:19,779
Thank you, cheers.

219
00:24:20,712 --> 00:24:22,188
This is nothing captain.

220
00:24:22,593 --> 00:24:23,593
Vihan's father.

221
00:24:23,687 --> 00:24:25,688
In fact, used to brew the
best brandy in the world.

222
00:24:26,235 --> 00:24:29,275
Sometimes we escaped from school
And we went drinking.

223
00:24:30,292 --> 00:24:32,862
Very soon, his father got suspicious

224
00:24:32,908 --> 00:24:34,182
to escape from the beating

225
00:24:34,322 --> 00:24:35,322
we together

226
00:24:35,956 --> 00:24:37,973
we transferred half the bottle of brandy
in our school bottle

227
00:24:38,023 --> 00:24:39,745
and panicked

228
00:24:39,964 --> 00:24:42,255
to fill that half bottle.

229
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:43,771
We fill it with urine.

230
00:24:43,842 --> 00:24:45,333
Not us, it was him only.

231
00:24:45,364 --> 00:24:46,762
And Unfortunately that night.

232
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,263
His uncle from foreign arrived

233
00:24:48,295 --> 00:24:49,295
uncle came yeah.

234
00:24:50,154 --> 00:24:52,173
To try the latest badge of brandy

235
00:24:52,688 --> 00:24:53,880
he drank it and said, listen listen.

236
00:24:53,904 --> 00:24:54,904
He drank it and said.

237
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:56,093
Exquisite!

238
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,090
Hello, Sir.

239
00:25:32,673 --> 00:25:33,673

240
00:25:33,829 --> 00:25:34,829
A few minutes ago.

241
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:37,728
Got her medication?

242
00:25:38,052 --> 00:25:39,052
Yes Sir.

243
00:25:40,012 --> 00:25:41,993
She has a habit of sleep walking

244
00:25:43,496 --> 00:25:44,496

245
00:25:44,612 --> 00:25:46,644

Listen, Stop spreading lies.

257
00:26:09,424 --> 00:26:10,692
You are creating a narrative.

258
00:26:11,128 --> 00:26:13,448
The whole world knows,
how much peace we want.

259
00:26:13,986 --> 00:26:15,928
Wherever a small attack
occurs in your country.

260
00:26:15,953 --> 00:26:17,550
You blame that on us.

261
00:26:19,497 --> 00:26:21,262
I say prove it

262
00:26:21,356 --> 00:26:22,946

263
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:30,121

265
00:26:33,898 --> 00:26:35,902
Shot some Punjab roadway buses.

266
00:26:36,605 --> 00:26:38,198
Some people got injured but

267
00:26:38,293 --> 00:26:41,074
driver used his brain and
did not stop the bus

268
00:26:41,324 --> 00:26:43,952
went straight to the government hospital.

269
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:47,130
Where are the terrorists now?

270
00:26:47,186 --> 00:26:50,466
They are hiding near the Dinanagar police
station in a under-construction building.

271
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,919
But swat team has began to
retaliate.

272
00:26:53,536 --> 00:26:55,038
Keep NSG on standby.

273
00:26:55,063 --> 00:26:55,875
Yes Sir.

274
00:26:55,891 --> 00:26:57,222
Which group are the terrorists from?

275
00:26:57,253 --> 00:26:59,133
Sources say they are from
Lashkar.

276
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:02,538
How many people died?

277
00:27:03,698 --> 00:27:04,973
Four citizens to this moment.

278
00:27:05,364 --> 00:27:06,364

279
00:27:06,711 --> 00:27:08,476

280
00:27:08,578 --> 00:27:09,578

IED bombs found on Pathankot
Amrisar rail tracks.

282
00:27:12,219 --> 00:27:13,619

00:27:28,496 --> 00:27:29,496
Sir.

287
00:27:29,591 --> 00:27:31,416
Swat team has arrived in Punjab.

289
00:27:37,421 --> 00:27:38,421

00:27:39,087 --> 00:27:41,342
We are doing everything from our side.

291
00:27:42,381 --> 00:27:43,381
Yes Sir.

EDI building.

335
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:28,538
One of the part of building is on fire.

336
00:32:28,592 --> 00:32:30,938
We heard two soldiers are wounded.

337
00:32:31,719 --> 00:32:33,321
But no other information is available.

338
00:32:37,821 --> 00:32:39,099
- Sir!
- Sir!

339
00:33:23,437 --> 00:33:24,770
Sir!

340
00:33:27,647 --> 00:33:28,982
Why are you here.

341
00:33:31,326 --> 00:33:33,100
Sir My case is under investigation.

342
00:33:40,154 --> 00:33:43,496
First posting was on July 2014
in Srinagar

343
00:33:44,254 --> 00:33:45,998
was still trying to understand the job

344
00:33:46,404 --> 00:33:50,461
on September 1 it rain so heavily
that a dam broke in Jhelum.

345
00:33:51,594 --> 00:33:54,965
The lower areas of Srinagar started
getting flooded with 15-20 feet of water

346
00:33:55,176 --> 00:33:56,929
we all MI-17s

347
00:33:57,171 --> 00:33:59,731
and group pilots immediately
started working on rescue missions.

348
00:33:59,931 --> 00:34:01,722
Without sleeping
or eat something.

349
00:34:01,769 --> 00:34:04,309
We started saving people from low lying
areas

350
00:34:05,098 --> 00:34:07,103
7th night at 3 am.

351
00:34:07,455 --> 00:34:09,674
A distress call came in from
Rajbaug.

352
00:34:09,698 --> 00:34:13,266
A severely injured 7 years old
kid with her mother

353
00:34:13,446 --> 00:34:15,766
stuck on the roofs of their house
alone.

354
00:34:16,204 --> 00:34:19,016
Due to rain
The field of vision was completely zero.

355
00:34:19,372 --> 00:34:22,391
The commander stopped all the
rescue operations until morning

356
00:34:22,983 --> 00:34:23,983
but somehow.

357
00:34:25,258 --> 00:34:27,516
The thought of that kid
did not go out of my mind.

358
00:34:29,024 --> 00:34:30,266
I had to do something.

359
00:34:40,435 --> 00:34:41,891
This is the girl, Sony.

360
00:34:51,836 --> 00:34:54,102
Is there someone in
your family in defence?

361
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:55,930
Father?

362
00:34:55,992 --> 00:34:56,992
Mother? Brother?

363
00:34:57,966 --> 00:34:58,966
No Sir.

364
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:01,965
I had a husband.

365
00:35:03,829 --> 00:35:05,641
Captain Jaskidr Singh Ranghi.

366
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,516
Season Punjab regiment.

367
00:35:08,188 --> 00:35:10,516
He was martyred in Nowshera sector.

368
00:35:14,683 --> 00:35:16,599
He was a patriotic man.

369
00:35:18,258 --> 00:35:20,016
I sit here now and I'm afraid that

370
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:23,766
will ever get a chance
to show my patriotism

371
00:35:23,954 --> 00:35:25,766
to jaskidr Singh.

372
00:35:46,655 --> 00:35:47,655
Mom.

373
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,100
Mom.

374
00:35:58,375 --> 00:35:59,375
Mom.

375
00:36:02,438 --> 00:36:03,438
Mommy

376
00:36:05,072 --> 00:36:06,072
Jasmin?

377
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Where is Mom?

378
00:36:19,368 --> 00:36:20,430
Inside sleeping.

379
00:36:23,563 --> 00:36:24,563
Stay here.

380
00:36:46,618 --> 00:36:48,031
Peacefully.

381
00:36:49,727 --> 00:36:51,266
More peaceful.

382
00:36:51,329 --> 00:36:53,391
Neha!
Did mom come here?

383
00:36:53,664 --> 00:36:54,664
No.

384
00:37:37,544 --> 00:37:39,315
I am extremely sorry

385
00:37:39,503 --> 00:37:40,673
I am sorry.

386
00:37:40,728 --> 00:37:41,768
It was really an emergency

387
00:37:41,802 --> 00:37:44,111
if it was not necessary
you know me.

388
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:46,155
Otherwise, I did not answer my phone

389
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:48,282
whats your real name?

390
00:37:49,528 --> 00:37:51,994
- Jasmine Almeida.
- What is the name of the real Jassimin?

391
00:37:52,525 --> 00:37:53,837
- Sir I just told you.
- Where is my mom?

392
00:37:53,861 --> 00:37:54,525
Vihan!

393
00:37:54,635 --> 00:37:56,165
One second! Neha one second.

394
00:37:57,141 --> 00:37:58,756
Now you listen to me.

395
00:37:58,857 --> 00:38:01,128
Me or my family.

396
00:38:01,816 --> 00:38:03,630
We do not need any protection

397
00:38:04,137 --> 00:38:05,137
I'm enough for that

398
00:38:06,063 --> 00:38:07,885
especially someone like you
Incompetent.

399
00:38:08,135 --> 00:38:09,970
And a fake nurse
We do not need it at all

400
00:38:10,212 --> 00:38:12,310
tell the intelligence service

401
00:38:12,568 --> 00:38:14,391
that by hook or by crook.

402
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:16,518
Find my mother and bring her home.

403
00:38:17,581 --> 00:38:18,581
Call.

404
00:38:22,724 --> 00:38:23,724
Can I answer?

405
00:38:23,795 --> 00:38:24,795
Yes you can

406
00:38:27,801 --> 00:38:28,801
hello.

407
00:38:30,535 --> 00:38:31,535
Where?

408
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:35,021
OK

409
00:38:38,718 --> 00:38:41,669
They found your mother under Dwarka
flyover

410
00:38:43,182 --> 00:38:44,182
the day I came here

411
00:38:44,271 --> 00:38:48,300
I put GPS trackers on all her clothes
so we could track her every movement

412
00:38:48,652 --> 00:38:49,785
should be home soon.

413
00:38:51,115 --> 00:38:53,764
I might be an incompetent nurse.

414
00:38:54,334 --> 00:38:55,849
But I'm a damn good agent Sir

415
00:38:59,615 --> 00:39:01,647
I'm sorry, should be home soon.

416
00:40:34,968 --> 00:40:36,283
Long live India, Sir.

417
00:40:37,072 --> 00:40:37,919
Long live India.

418
00:40:37,959 --> 00:40:39,349
A few more minutes for breakfast.

419
00:40:42,956 --> 00:40:43,956
Can you get some tea?

420
00:40:47,764 --> 00:40:48,764
Shakil.

421
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:51,750
Shakil.

422
00:40:55,634 --> 00:40:56,634
Shakil.

423
00:42:49,438 --> 00:42:51,585
Sir heavily armed
4-5 terrorists expected.

424
00:43:30,651 --> 00:43:31,651
Sir-What's the update?

425
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,050
Two are hiding behind Westin.

426
00:43:33,074 --> 00:43:35,059
Major Awasti team is counter firing.

427
00:43:35,136 --> 00:43:37,923
One on top of Eden block and
one behind the T6 wall.

428
00:43:42,714 --> 00:43:43,924
- Sartaj!
- Sir?

429
00:43:44,713 --> 00:43:46,223
Bring my Draganov from target room

430
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,134
I'll kill these idiots from range easily

431
00:43:48,184 --> 00:43:49,184
hurry.

432
00:43:53,736 --> 00:43:54,613
Rohit.

433
00:43:54,692 --> 00:43:55,839
- Thapa.
- Sir?

434
00:43:56,024 --> 00:43:57,357
Cover me

435
00:43:57,584 --> 00:43:58,584
sartaj.

436
00:43:59,243 --> 00:44:00,243
From west wing

437
00:44:00,339 --> 00:44:01,379
go inside fuel depot

438
00:44:01,933 --> 00:44:03,597
you both reach near T6 bunker as well.

439
00:44:03,628 --> 00:44:04,866
- Sir!
- Best of luck guys.

440
00:44:27,996 --> 00:44:29,558
- Go go.
- Yes Sir!

441
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:49,549
- Guards!
- Be ready!

442
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:16,139
♪ Go ahead with courage! ♪

443
00:49:17,217 --> 00:49:18,816
♪ With power ♪

444
00:49:19,824 --> 00:49:21,100
♪ With audacity ♪

445
00:49:21,623 --> 00:49:27,480
♪ The country is like a religion ♪

446
00:50:46,444 --> 00:50:49,979
I don't care what UN and US say
right now.

447
00:50:51,232 --> 00:50:53,119
The language which Pakistan understands.

448
00:50:53,438 --> 00:50:56,683
We need to teach them a lesson
in their own language.

449
00:50:57,199 --> 00:51:01,766
If we won't retaliate against
this cowardly act.

450
00:51:02,664 --> 00:51:06,266
The trust of our army and
people will get destroyed.

451
00:51:06,562 --> 00:51:07,761
Their beliefs will be lost.

452
00:51:08,136 --> 00:51:09,896
People do not accept
the government anymore.

453
00:51:10,735 --> 00:51:13,016
Sir for war
We can get ready in three days

454
00:51:13,227 --> 00:51:16,719
I can send our tanks and
artillery on LOC in 6 hours

455
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:19,852
I think we should stop the water
from our Indus treaty

456
00:51:20,165 --> 00:51:22,873
when people put pressure
on Pakistani government.

457
00:51:22,975 --> 00:51:25,297
Maybe their attacks will stop

458
00:51:26,094 --> 00:51:27,891
Pakistan is below their army

459
00:51:28,633 --> 00:51:30,641
army is not below Pakistan

460
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:32,130
they will let their own people

461
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:33,974
die from hunger and thirst

462
00:51:34,693 --> 00:51:36,975
but won't stop funding terror.

463
00:51:37,655 --> 00:51:40,183
We need to find a better way to solve this.

464
00:51:40,652 --> 00:51:41,652
That is true.

465
00:51:42,128 --> 00:51:43,128
Govind.

466
00:51:45,511 --> 00:51:46,511
Govind.

467
00:51:49,461 --> 00:51:50,776
Surgical strike, Sir.

468
00:51:52,294 --> 00:51:53,558
Surgical strike!

469
00:51:54,579 --> 00:51:56,179
We enter POK.
(Pakistan occupied Kashmir)

470
00:51:56,369 --> 00:51:58,766
We destroy all their
terrorist launchpads

471
00:51:58,993 --> 00:52:00,508
all their leaders

472
00:52:00,533 --> 00:52:02,530
all their handlers, guides.

473
00:52:02,569 --> 00:52:03,753
We will finish everything.

474
00:52:04,152 --> 00:52:07,214
Given Pakistan's background
they will never accept that.

475
00:52:07,245 --> 00:52:09,516
There are such groups in their land

476
00:52:09,657 --> 00:52:10,547
as a result.

477
00:52:10,586 --> 00:52:12,579
According to them, there is no terrorist.

478
00:52:12,625 --> 00:52:13,657
There was no attack

479
00:52:13,969 --> 00:52:15,266
when there was no attack.

480
00:52:15,446 --> 00:52:17,454
No war and no international pressure

481
00:52:18,032 --> 00:52:19,152
more important than that

482
00:52:19,357 --> 00:52:21,102
to avenge Uri.

483
00:52:21,672 --> 00:52:23,041
Best opportunity.

484
00:52:24,439 --> 00:52:26,508
The risk of a tactical attack is not high?

485
00:52:26,649 --> 00:52:28,271
If we want we can use fighter jets

486
00:52:28,296 --> 00:52:31,235
to destroy their bunkers
nearby LOC border.

487
00:52:31,477 --> 00:52:33,032
At unique Olympics

488
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:34,669
Israeli athletes were

489
00:52:34,694 --> 00:52:36,523
killed by PLO terrorists

490
00:52:37,203 --> 00:52:39,750
Israel did not take revenge
by launching missiles

491
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:42,141
they performed an operation
called: "Wrath of God"

492
00:52:42,578 --> 00:52:43,789
each and every terrorist

493
00:52:43,891 --> 00:52:44,931
they searched and followed

494
00:52:45,005 --> 00:52:46,807
they killed them in their own house.

495
00:52:47,065 --> 00:52:51,641
In the history of India till now
We never attacked any country first

496
00:52:52,164 --> 00:52:55,766
Pakistan is taking advantage of this
from beginning

497
00:52:56,086 --> 00:53:00,058
1947, 1965, 1971,1999

498
00:53:00,808 --> 00:53:04,024
In fact Sir,
they are taking advantage of our tolerance.

499
00:53:04,813 --> 00:53:06,100
It's time now

500
00:53:06,288 --> 00:53:08,143
to put fear in their hearts.

501
00:53:08,206 --> 00:53:09,720
They should be taught

502
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:11,553
India will not stay silent now.

503
00:53:12,256 --> 00:53:13,703
This is a new India.

504
00:53:14,454 --> 00:53:16,766
We'll invade their homes.

505
00:53:16,796 --> 00:53:17,916
And hit them where it hurts.

506
00:53:21,985 --> 00:53:22,985
Ravindra Ji.

507
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,891
We do not have war with Pakistani people.

508
00:53:26,243 --> 00:53:27,766
Our war with terrorist groups.

509
00:53:29,157 --> 00:53:30,433
I think govind is right

510
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:32,042
Arjun.

511
00:53:32,535 --> 00:53:33,927
I think it's a good idea

512
00:53:43,736 --> 00:53:44,736
well then

513
00:53:45,111 --> 00:53:46,477
within ten days

514
00:53:46,743 --> 00:53:49,766
Pakistan for the first time
We will see our surgical strike.

515
00:53:50,243 --> 00:53:51,243
Dear Ravinder.

516
00:53:51,295 --> 00:53:53,095
Prepare a team with Arjun.

517
00:53:53,249 --> 00:53:54,766
You will take complete
responsibility for this.

518
00:53:54,791 --> 00:53:55,791
With you.

519
00:53:56,063 --> 00:53:57,422
All the planning will be yours.

520
00:53:57,704 --> 00:53:59,474
Daily Progress Report.

521
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:01,183
Direct to me Yes.

522
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:03,805
You all keep Pakistani authorities
busy.

523
00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:04,890
Remember.

524
00:54:04,925 --> 00:54:06,974
Ask them Uri proofs

525
00:54:07,958 --> 00:54:09,138
ask them answers

526
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,829
but no one
under no circumstances

527
00:54:12,697 --> 00:54:15,070
should not get get aware of our plan

528
00:54:18,196 --> 00:54:19,196
make sure.

529
00:54:21,579 --> 00:54:23,166
These meetings don’t get logged.

530
00:54:42,856 --> 00:54:43,856
Did you eat anything?

531
00:54:44,302 --> 00:54:45,558
NoSir I do not want to.

532
00:54:46,128 --> 00:54:47,719
Sit, ill get you something.

533
00:54:49,633 --> 00:54:50,633
I’m in hurry.

534
00:54:54,568 --> 00:54:56,423
I just received orders.

535
00:54:59,988 --> 00:55:01,766
There's going to be an
operation in Kashmir.

536
00:55:04,579 --> 00:55:06,141
I do not know the details

537
00:55:07,758 --> 00:55:08,758
maybe.

538
00:55:09,907 --> 00:55:11,516
They want to send answer for Uri.

539
00:56:08,126 --> 00:56:09,632
Karan Sir always said.

540
00:56:11,071 --> 00:56:13,423
No one will die when we have
Vihan with us

541
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:16,931
when we have him with us

542
00:56:17,501 --> 00:56:19,058
even death is scared of us.

543
00:56:24,879 --> 00:56:26,719
Really wish that
You were there to lead us Sir.

544
00:57:04,097 --> 00:57:05,386
Inside karan's stuff.

545
00:57:06,519 --> 00:57:08,024
I found 2 dirty shirts.

546
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:12,236
I don’t understand what to do.

547
00:57:15,667 --> 00:57:17,200
I don't want to wash them

548
00:57:18,523 --> 00:57:20,119
and don't want to give it to anyone

549
00:57:23,806 --> 00:57:24,806
they

550
00:57:26,683 --> 00:57:28,188
it has smell of his empathy.

551
00:58:20,471 --> 00:58:22,433
Sir! You said one time in your speech.

552
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:24,859
There exists a thin line between

553
00:58:26,031 --> 00:58:27,562
responsibility and irresponsibility.

554
00:58:29,195 --> 00:58:30,690
I don't want to be that line Sir.

555
00:58:31,901 --> 00:58:34,402
If I don't fight for my country
and my men now..

556
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:37,822
..then I'll be irresponsible
in my own opinion

557
00:58:39,431 --> 00:58:40,950
and, I cannot live like that.

558
00:58:43,255 --> 00:58:46,415
I promise you, you can send me to any
god forsaken corner of this world to fight

559
00:58:46,657 --> 00:58:49,667
I'll bring back each and every
soldier safe and sound

560
00:58:51,112 --> 00:58:54,130
sir please
let me be a part of the Kashmir mission.

561
00:58:55,396 --> 00:58:56,674
I request you Sir, Please!

562
00:58:59,955 --> 00:59:00,955
Vihan!

563
00:59:01,572 --> 00:59:04,975
In the next 8 days you are going to
carry out a surgical strike in POK.

564
00:59:10,144 --> 00:59:13,016
Tomorrow morning
Gen. Grayval at the commando base

565
00:59:13,868 --> 00:59:16,641
will give you all the details
of this operation

566
00:59:17,696 --> 00:59:19,224
all the on ground plannings

567
00:59:19,249 --> 00:59:20,900
you will plan alongside him

568
00:59:21,672 --> 00:59:23,516
prepare a great team

569
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:26,641
and revert back to me on 23rd night.

570
00:59:26,672 --> 00:59:28,558
With thorough details

571
00:59:29,709 --> 00:59:30,709
understood, Sir.

572
00:59:31,631 --> 00:59:32,891
I wish you all the best.

573
00:59:35,055 --> 00:59:36,255
Thank you very much!

574
00:59:53,409 --> 00:59:55,473
I've been looking at
this map for forty years

575
00:59:57,652 --> 00:59:59,904
when I close my eyes
I don’t see my kid's face.

576
01:00:01,738 --> 01:00:04,283
I see the divided Kashmir map

577
01:00:05,196 --> 01:00:06,452
and for the same I tell you.

578
01:00:08,201 --> 01:00:09,771
Going inside POK will be easy.

579
01:00:10,376 --> 01:00:12,929
But the problem is returning
after the attack.

580
01:00:14,546 --> 01:00:15,546
I understand, Sir.

581
01:00:17,566 --> 01:00:19,382
We will plan for anything

582
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:20,800
did you finalize the team?

583
01:00:23,574 --> 01:00:27,348
<i>Sir, in Uri we lost most of the soldiers
from Dovra and Bihar regiment.</i>

584
01:00:28,819 --> 01:00:29,819
<i>I suggest that.</i>

585
01:00:30,218 --> 01:00:33,479
<i>Other than special forces
we need few soldiers</i>

586
01:00:33,526 --> 01:00:35,086
<i>from this regiment as well.</i>

587
01:00:35,784 --> 01:00:37,002
<i>Because sometimes to win a war,</i>

588
01:00:37,052 --> 01:00:39,994
<i>except training we need some motivation
and fire inside soldiers as well.</i>

589
01:00:40,495 --> 01:00:41,800
<i>I want to use their anger and fire</i>

590
01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:43,864
<i>in the right way possible.</i>

591
01:00:53,171 --> 01:00:54,171
Stand At Ease.

592
01:01:00,172 --> 01:01:01,172
Commandos.

593
01:01:02,043 --> 01:01:03,801
My name is Major Vihan Shergil.

594
01:01:05,246 --> 01:01:06,762
And he is the captain Sartaj.

595
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:10,057
Everyone take your phones out.

596
01:01:12,541 --> 01:01:14,603
Now send your family a text message

597
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:17,500
that until the morning of September 29th

598
01:01:19,187 --> 01:01:21,836
you will live in Udempur for
a special tactical training

599
01:01:23,656 --> 01:01:24,670
during this training.

600
01:01:25,249 --> 01:01:28,784
You will not be allowed to speak
or send a message to anyone

601
01:01:29,597 --> 01:01:31,120
up to seven days later.

602
01:01:32,386 --> 01:01:33,914
Turn off your phone

603
01:01:35,117 --> 01:01:36,117
write.

604
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:53,640
Sent?

605
01:01:53,896 --> 01:01:55,278
Yes Sir that's good.

606
01:01:57,741 --> 01:01:59,774
Put your phone in this bag.

607
01:02:01,396 --> 01:02:03,770
Now you will get your phone on 29th morning

608
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:10,451
what I want to tell you.

609
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:15,790
You will not forget these words
until your death

610
01:02:18,492 --> 01:02:20,002
the night of September 28th

611
01:02:21,358 --> 01:02:22,661
I'm giving you a opportunity

612
01:02:22,712 --> 01:02:25,224
to get your brothers revenge
that were killed in Uri

613
01:02:27,571 --> 01:02:29,142
just like how they killed without mercy

614
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:34,017
like cowards they killed our brothers in
their sleep.

615
01:02:35,309 --> 01:02:37,186
The answer to that cruelty.

616
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:42,983
We their head off.

617
01:02:46,107 --> 01:02:47,655
Are you ready for this mission?

618
01:02:47,694 --> 01:02:48,694
Yes Sir!

619
01:02:49,022 --> 01:02:50,533
Is your blood boiling for revenge?

620
01:02:50,579 --> 01:02:51,579
Yes Sir!

621
01:02:51,906 --> 01:02:52,906
Commandos

622
01:02:53,371 --> 01:02:54,371
who are we?

623
01:02:54,425 --> 01:02:55,663
The Indian army.

624
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:57,457
The Indian Army did not start this war.

625
01:02:57,482 --> 01:02:59,029
But we will bloody hell
finish it!

626
01:02:59,053 --> 01:03:00,053
Yes Sir!

627
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:01,837
- How's the Spirit?!
- High Sir!

628
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:04,755
- How's the Spirit?!
- High Sir!

629
01:03:04,826 --> 01:03:05,826
Good!

630
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:25,060
Yes Sir!

631
01:03:25,590 --> 01:03:26,861
No it's our mistake ji.

632
01:03:27,017 --> 01:03:28,279
Yes, I'll search it.

633
01:03:28,786 --> 01:03:30,035
Yes, it's indeed necessary

634
01:03:30,372 --> 01:03:31,615
you do not worry.

635
01:03:32,217 --> 01:03:33,492
Yes, yes Good bye.

636
01:03:42,536 --> 01:03:44,795
You are a classy fool.

637
01:03:44,865 --> 01:03:47,756
Dumb, rubbish, bitch.

638
01:03:48,256 --> 01:03:49,500
Do you have children or not?

639
01:03:50,305 --> 01:03:51,575
Do not have children.

640
01:03:53,215 --> 01:03:55,945
From past 1 month I'm telling you.

641
01:03:55,975 --> 01:03:58,500
There is a person in our department.

642
01:03:58,547 --> 01:04:00,352
That is informing to India.

643
01:04:01,079 --> 01:04:03,606
And you have not found him yet?

644
01:04:05,395 --> 01:04:06,395
I swear to God.

645
01:04:09,135 --> 01:04:10,852
I feel that

646
01:04:11,274 --> 01:04:12,781
is the spy one of you?

647
01:04:14,797 --> 01:04:16,827
Do you know how much I'm under pressure?

648
01:04:17,975 --> 01:04:18,975
Within a week

649
01:04:20,335 --> 01:04:22,082
if before one week

650
01:04:22,128 --> 01:04:23,751
you do not find that informer

651
01:04:24,173 --> 01:04:28,964
then I'll cook <i>one</i> of
you for my breakfast.

652
01:04:28,989 --> 01:04:30,674
And I swear by God.

653
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:34,428
I will not even burp!

654
01:04:36,344 --> 01:04:38,891
You stood up to me, what?
Get out of here!

655
01:04:39,579 --> 01:04:41,393
Kareem Give me that file

656
01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:44,805
I'm miserable.

657
01:04:51,425 --> 01:04:52,696
Yeah, mum this is me.

658
01:04:53,204 --> 01:04:54,740
Hello. How are you?

659
01:04:54,951 --> 01:04:56,700
Yes you are right.

660
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:58,911
You asked for mobile number
of aunt of Belgias right?

661
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:00,955
Take pen and write.

662
01:05:01,349 --> 01:05:02,349
Three, four.

663
01:05:03,841 --> 01:05:04,841
Four, no.

664
01:05:05,703 --> 01:05:06,703
Five, eight

665
01:05:08,395 --> 01:05:09,395
eight

666
01:05:09,797 --> 01:05:10,797
seventy four.

667
01:05:11,427 --> 01:05:12,427
Twenty-one.

668
01:05:13,437 --> 01:05:14,437
Two.

669
01:05:15,194 --> 01:05:16,194
Yes.

670
01:05:17,688 --> 01:05:19,419
No no I do not feel good.

671
01:05:19,458 --> 01:05:21,222
Sounds like that.

672
01:05:21,277 --> 01:05:22,977
This is because of gastric gas

673
01:05:23,102 --> 01:05:24,892
I have STD in my stomach.

674
01:05:25,550 --> 01:05:27,273
You also note your Uncle Mono's number.

675
01:05:55,546 --> 01:05:56,546
Sir!

676
01:05:56,608 --> 01:05:57,808
We got the coordinates

677
01:05:57,868 --> 01:05:59,638
total 7 area locations

678
01:05:59,688 --> 01:06:00,669
all close to LOC.

679
01:06:00,694 --> 01:06:02,878
But the exact location
of the launchpads

680
01:06:02,933 --> 01:06:04,685
we have to find it physically

681
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:06,645
call Shrinivas from ISRO.

682
01:06:09,081 --> 01:06:12,693
Tripura, Assam pictures are not coming
due to heavy rains

683
01:06:17,291 --> 01:06:18,182
hello.

684
01:06:18,253 --> 01:06:19,253
Govind here.

685
01:06:19,325 --> 01:06:20,485
From the Ministry of Defense.

686
01:06:20,628 --> 01:06:21,628
Hi, govind!

687
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:22,501
Tell me

688
01:06:22,666 --> 01:06:23,666
listen!

689
01:06:23,727 --> 01:06:26,053
I'm sending you series of coordinates

690
01:06:26,208 --> 01:06:28,333
satellite 1 or satellite 2.

691
01:06:28,474 --> 01:06:31,475
One of these satellites
for six days

692
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:33,422
I want you to focus on
these coordinates

693
01:06:33,547 --> 01:06:34,665
and don't let it move

694
01:06:34,711 --> 01:06:35,741
no matter anything happens.

695
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:37,301
- OK.
- Another thing.

696
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:40,846
Relay all the images directly
to the ministry of defense

697
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:42,681
we have only two hours of time.

698
01:06:42,712 --> 01:06:43,712
OK

699
01:06:44,651 --> 01:06:47,148
You and the army intelligence office
together.

700
01:06:47,187 --> 01:06:49,453
Sit down and search each and
every location of these coordinates

701
01:06:49,503 --> 01:06:51,891
we can send our soldiers only
when

702
01:06:51,916 --> 01:06:55,062
we have all the details of
each and every location.

703
01:06:55,092 --> 01:06:56,092
- Correct?
- Yes Sir.

704
01:06:59,722 --> 01:07:00,722
Done Sir.

705
01:07:12,534 --> 01:07:15,631
Send this feed directly
to the defence ministry.

706
01:07:15,661 --> 01:07:16,566
Sir!

707
01:07:16,591 --> 01:07:17,714
We have the feed.

708
01:08:00,543 --> 01:08:01,543
Palavi.

709
01:08:02,233 --> 01:08:03,338
Palavi Sharma.

710
01:08:04,534 --> 01:08:06,306
That day you asked my real name

711
01:08:08,298 --> 01:08:09,852
I'm really sorry about that day

712
01:08:10,149 --> 01:08:11,149
it's okay.

713
01:08:11,801 --> 01:08:13,564
If I were in your place

714
01:08:13,814 --> 01:08:15,241
I showed the same reaction.

715
01:08:16,703 --> 01:08:17,703
How's mom

716
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:19,953
she is

717
01:08:20,384 --> 01:08:21,384
she's fine!

718
01:08:22,134 --> 01:08:23,699
Now Neha is living with her.

719
01:08:23,879 --> 01:08:26,144
Also we got a full time nurse
so..lets see

720
01:08:26,910 --> 01:08:28,150
I'm hope she is better than me.

721
01:08:32,442 --> 01:08:34,314
I think it's time.

722
01:08:34,377 --> 01:08:35,377
We should get going.

723
01:08:38,201 --> 01:08:39,201
I will look into this.

724
01:08:39,465 --> 01:08:40,465
Sir!

725
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:42,467
- Sir!
- Welcome Vihan.

726
01:08:42,678 --> 01:08:43,678
Have a sit.

727
01:08:45,591 --> 01:08:46,591
Team selected?

728
01:08:46,745 --> 01:08:47,745
Yes Sir.

729
01:08:47,823 --> 01:08:49,463
How about the training of the commandos?

730
01:08:49,506 --> 01:08:50,429
Already started Sir

731
01:08:50,468 --> 01:08:51,468
that's good.

732
01:08:52,031 --> 01:08:53,031
Ms. Palavi.

733
01:08:53,059 --> 01:08:54,059
You get started.

734
01:08:54,085 --> 01:08:55,085
Sir.

735
01:08:56,501 --> 01:09:00,278
Sir 5 launchpads of Hizbul,
Lashkar and Jaish are confirmed.

736
01:09:01,176 --> 01:09:02,176
Two in the Leepa valley.

737
01:09:02,235 --> 01:09:03,102
Two in Kel.

738
01:09:03,176 --> 01:09:04,176
And one in Bhimber.

739
01:09:04,414 --> 01:09:06,763
All these launchpads are
in isolated areas.

740
01:09:06,825 --> 01:09:08,225
That's why it was easy to find them

741
01:09:08,286 --> 01:09:09,709
and two other

742
01:09:09,755 --> 01:09:12,961
they might be in forests of
Muzaffarabad

743
01:09:13,438 --> 01:09:15,542
sir using satellite images
of crowded locations

744
01:09:15,588 --> 01:09:17,753
finding the exact location

745
01:09:17,778 --> 01:09:18,778
is difficult

746
01:09:20,321 --> 01:09:21,465
I'll tomorrow.

747
01:09:21,504 --> 01:09:25,010
Give DRDO a visit to see
if they can help us

748
01:09:25,049 --> 01:09:27,089
find these launchpads

749
01:09:27,201 --> 01:09:28,201
and Ms. Palawi.

750
01:09:28,269 --> 01:09:31,517
You keep updating Vihan about all
the details of these launchpads.

751
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:32,252
Right Sir.

752
01:09:32,299 --> 01:09:34,812
Vihan any suggestion?
Any question?

753
01:09:38,907 --> 01:09:40,192
Which of these launchpad

754
01:09:40,528 --> 01:09:42,278
was used for Uri attack?

755
01:09:43,362 --> 01:09:46,657
We have suspicion that muzaffarabad
launchpad was used by the attackers

756
01:09:47,001 --> 01:09:48,784
and who was the handler of that attack?

757
01:09:50,327 --> 01:09:51,662
Information about that

758
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:53,997
we don't have it yet, sorry.

759
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:03,067
These sigma-5 drones are

760
01:10:03,092 --> 01:10:04,591
our latest inventions

761
01:10:05,044 --> 01:10:06,802
developed along with the

762
01:10:07,810 --> 01:10:09,888
Israeli intelligence.

763
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:12,679
Sir.

764
01:10:13,769 --> 01:10:16,395
Their range is approx 50 kilometers

765
01:10:16,464 --> 01:10:19,398
and it can fly 2 kilometers
above the ground level

766
01:10:20,947 --> 01:10:22,693
that's all good Brian, but.

767
01:10:22,935 --> 01:10:25,195
How close can it fly to the ground?

768
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:26,738
Without anybody noticing it

769
01:10:26,910 --> 01:10:27,910
what do you mean?

770
01:10:28,734 --> 01:10:30,742
I mean I want a drone that can

771
01:10:30,767 --> 01:10:33,329
fly near an enemy's window

772
01:10:33,354 --> 01:10:34,663
still he won't understand.

773
01:10:34,688 --> 01:10:35,688
Sir!

774
01:10:36,104 --> 01:10:38,359
Such technology has not yet been made

775
01:10:38,384 --> 01:10:39,876
I thought as much.

776
01:10:52,374 --> 01:10:54,039
Sir he is our intern!

777
01:10:54,118 --> 01:10:55,118
What's your name son?

778
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:56,030
Ishaan

779
01:10:56,078 --> 01:10:57,603
Ishaan Vatal Sir

780
01:11:00,139 --> 01:11:01,139
what is this?

781
01:11:01,273 --> 01:11:03,525
Sir its an unmanned aerial vehicle

782
01:11:03,705 --> 01:11:04,705
shaped like an eagle

783
01:11:04,908 --> 01:11:05,908
uh huh.

784
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:08,309
What is it called?

785
01:11:08,364 --> 01:11:09,364
Garud.

786
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:11,742
What?
Garud, based on the legend of Vishnu-

787
01:11:12,345 --> 01:11:13,345
Legend of Vishnu, yes.

788
01:11:14,119 --> 01:11:16,519
Sorry Sir ...There are many
projects under construction here

789
01:11:16,622 --> 01:11:19,298
I use waste parts to pass
some time

790
01:11:19,346 --> 01:11:20,346
Ishaan.

791
01:11:20,564 --> 01:11:22,337
Show me how it fly’s, come on.

792
01:11:24,826 --> 01:11:26,340
Sorry Sir.

793
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Sir.

794
01:11:39,688 --> 01:11:40,755
Sir when I say.

795
01:11:41,016 --> 01:11:42,773
You need to run fast

796
01:11:43,421 --> 01:11:44,926
and with all power

797
01:11:45,278 --> 01:11:46,278
throw it in the air

798
01:11:46,370 --> 01:11:47,802
wait one minute Sir.

799
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:50,040
Sir Get your hands up.

800
01:11:51,244 --> 01:11:52,244
Higher, Sir.

801
01:11:53,933 --> 01:11:55,026
Sir A bit more.

802
01:11:56,746 --> 01:11:57,746
Sorry Sir.

803
01:11:58,711 --> 01:11:59,711
Sir Three.

804
01:12:00,729 --> 01:12:01,729
Two.

805
01:12:02,814 --> 01:12:03,814
One.

806
01:12:42,918 --> 01:12:43,918
What's the range?

807
01:12:44,022 --> 01:12:46,775
Sir it can fly up to the distance
of 12 kilometers

808
01:12:46,814 --> 01:12:49,353
and at least 4 hours of battery
backup on single charge.

809
01:12:49,802 --> 01:12:52,253
Has GPS, infrared, night vision
enabled.

810
01:12:52,359 --> 01:12:55,503
It has a 16 megapixel camera and 7.2x
digital zoom.

811
01:12:55,555 --> 01:12:58,413
For take off and landing it can hover
at one place also.

812
01:12:58,482 --> 01:12:59,482
Like.

813
01:13:05,581 --> 01:13:06,581
This

814
01:13:07,963 --> 01:13:10,705
for take off and landing it
can hover at one place

815
01:13:11,876 --> 01:13:13,552
then why did you make Brian run?

816
01:13:15,455 --> 01:13:16,709
- Brian.
- Yes Sir

817
01:13:16,905 --> 01:13:18,787
I want 4 of these until tomorrow

818
01:13:19,483 --> 01:13:20,590
- until tomorrow?
- Yeah.

819
01:13:20,739 --> 01:13:24,563
Sir, this is just a prototype that
this kid made just for time pass.

820
01:13:24,790 --> 01:13:26,217
This is not commissioned

821
01:13:26,241 --> 01:13:27,978
and might take a month for it.

822
01:13:28,003 --> 01:13:29,321
Can you make 4 by tomorrow?

823
01:13:30,658 --> 01:13:31,658
Huh?

824
01:13:34,164 --> 01:13:35,504
If the whole team is helping.

825
01:13:35,657 --> 01:13:36,657
Why not Sir?

826
01:13:36,728 --> 01:13:37,688
Good. Brian.

827
01:13:37,712 --> 01:13:39,622
Yes?-
Stop all other work..

828
01:13:39,684 --> 01:13:42,331
Start a new assembly line and
tell all technicians

829
01:13:42,433 --> 01:13:43,700
to work only on this.

830
01:13:44,168 --> 01:13:48,269
Until tomorrow afternoon I want Ishaan
along with 4 guards on Kashmir's flight.

831
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:50,010
OK?

832
01:13:50,408 --> 01:13:51,408
Uh huh.

833
01:13:54,356 --> 01:13:56,505
You might have just won us the war son.

834
01:13:57,494 --> 01:13:58,494
Good job!

835
01:14:07,672 --> 01:14:09,000
Sorry Sir.

836
01:14:16,089 --> 01:14:17,089
Sir!

837
01:14:18,042 --> 01:14:20,535
It's time to show Jaskidr
Ji some patriotism.

838
01:14:25,624 --> 01:14:27,292
You are going to be my pilot Sirat.

839
01:14:32,902 --> 01:14:33,902
Sir.

840
01:14:34,892 --> 01:14:35,892
Excuse me.

841
01:14:38,854 --> 01:14:39,642
Hello.

842
01:14:39,698 --> 01:14:41,974
Army intelligence has caught
two guides near Baramula.

843
01:14:41,998 --> 01:14:44,976
It's likely that they
have information on Uri attack.

844
01:14:45,132 --> 01:14:47,437
Govind Sir wants us to lead the
interrogation.

845
01:14:47,531 --> 01:14:48,531
When are you leaving?

846
01:14:48,563 --> 01:14:49,517
In two hours.

847
01:14:49,564 --> 01:14:50,564
Balaampor airspace.

848
01:15:30,731 --> 01:15:32,491
Who was the handler of
Uri attack?

849
01:15:32,763 --> 01:15:34,123
Where did the planning took place?

850
01:15:34,268 --> 01:15:35,819
Mam, we don't know anything.

851
01:15:36,358 --> 01:15:38,955
We work in walnut business.

852
01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:39,980
Don't you lie

853
01:15:40,293 --> 01:15:42,576
or I'll break your balls!

854
01:15:42,606 --> 01:15:44,892
Mam I swear to god, believe me.

855
01:15:45,455 --> 01:15:48,723
The pain! The pain!

856
01:15:48,748 --> 01:15:50,579
Who was responsible for the attack?

857
01:15:50,604 --> 01:15:52,837
I want the names!

858
01:15:52,954 --> 01:15:54,254
Who was responsible for it?

859
01:15:57,114 --> 01:15:59,134
Who was responsible for
the attack on Uri?

860
01:15:59,337 --> 01:16:00,699
The pain

861
01:16:00,737 --> 01:16:02,367
I want the names.

862
01:16:02,607 --> 01:16:04,371
The pain.

863
01:16:04,401 --> 01:16:06,038
Who was in the attack?

864
01:16:23,814 --> 01:16:25,014
What is his relation with you?

865
01:16:27,632 --> 01:16:28,914
My brother, Sir.

866
01:16:30,266 --> 01:16:31,266
What's his name?

867
01:16:32,942 --> 01:16:33,942
Faizal!

868
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:38,240
Listen, faizal.

869
01:16:40,187 --> 01:16:41,718
We have very little time

870
01:16:43,156 --> 01:16:44,931
your brother has only two ways.

871
01:16:46,721 --> 01:16:47,721
One.

872
01:16:48,809 --> 01:16:51,520
He tells us calmly who was
the handler for Uri attack.

873
01:16:52,824 --> 01:16:53,824
Two

874
01:16:55,358 --> 01:16:58,109
I'll pull your intestines and put
them on his lap.

875
01:17:03,683 --> 01:17:04,683
Want some tea?

876
01:17:46,764 --> 01:17:49,285
Man please stop him!

877
01:17:49,828 --> 01:17:52,289
He is just a kid.

878
01:17:52,858 --> 01:17:54,874
Mam please.

879
01:17:56,137 --> 01:17:57,400
Mam please, he will die please

880
01:17:58,157 --> 01:17:59,921
I'll tell you.

881
01:18:01,804 --> 01:18:02,804
Idriss.

882
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:04,037
Idriss.

883
01:18:04,061 --> 01:18:05,311
From Baghdad.

884
01:18:07,307 --> 01:18:08,847
He made the plan.

885
01:18:09,184 --> 01:18:10,890
Jabbar Firozi was the handler

886
01:18:53,298 --> 01:18:54,298
this is the doctrine.

887
01:18:54,943 --> 01:18:55,943
And that's the point.

888
01:18:56,371 --> 01:18:58,179
Before Uri attack, Pampur attack
was carried out by them.

889
01:18:58,217 --> 01:18:59,804
Planned by these two And led.

890
01:19:00,231 --> 01:19:01,434
Idriss from Yalcourt.

891
01:19:01,879 --> 01:19:03,168
And jabbar from Gilgit

892
01:19:03,245 --> 01:19:05,140
seven years ago in a training camp of
Jaish E Mohammad

893
01:19:05,165 --> 01:19:07,116
they meet each other at a training camp.

894
01:19:07,178 --> 01:19:09,477
And a few years later
under the supervision of the same group.

895
01:19:09,501 --> 01:19:12,828
These two made their own
special terrorist group.

896
01:19:12,853 --> 01:19:13,853
Sirat-ul-jannat.

897
01:19:14,845 --> 01:19:17,090
In the forest area of ​​Mozaffarabad

898
01:19:17,115 --> 01:19:18,414
near the village of Chacoty

899
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:20,806
their launchpad is located.

900
01:19:21,018 --> 01:19:23,088
From the nearby forest
around the launchpads

901
01:19:23,113 --> 01:19:24,460
using the natural caves around there.

902
01:19:24,484 --> 01:19:27,092
Their guide, help terrorists
to reach India.

903
01:19:27,311 --> 01:19:29,470
We have given the location of these
caves to the army

904
01:19:29,494 --> 01:19:31,054
there are under the supervision.

905
01:19:31,714 --> 01:19:34,002
And for additional surveillance

906
01:19:34,056 --> 01:19:36,768
4 drones from DRDO
will reach Kashmir tomorrow.

907
01:19:37,549 --> 01:19:38,549
Now from tomorrow.

908
01:19:38,916 --> 01:19:40,439
Enhance the defence on LOC border.

909
01:19:40,664 --> 01:19:43,191
And for 3 consecutive days, increase
it slowly

910
01:19:43,216 --> 01:19:44,466
so that by 28th of night.

911
01:19:44,491 --> 01:19:46,903
We will reach Shailin border

912
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:48,585
especially around

913
01:19:48,686 --> 01:19:50,880
the areas from where our commandos

914
01:19:50,943 --> 01:19:52,317
are going to enter PoK.

As of 0900 hours

952
01:22:03,114 --> 01:22:05,554
India has increased defence at
the border.

953
01:22:05,713 --> 01:22:10,746
It seems that India is still looking for an
answer To our PM's speech at UN.

954
01:22:10,887 --> 01:22:12,708
Sir, perhaps the defence
at border

955
01:22:12,786 --> 01:22:14,717
is to distract us?

956
01:22:15,669 --> 01:22:17,679
If there was a second attack plan

957
01:22:17,718 --> 01:22:21,308
then our intelligence agency could
have got some clues until now

958
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:24,727
India has no capability to think
of another attack.

959
01:22:24,797 --> 01:22:27,314
Already there's a bad situation
in Kashmir.

960
01:22:27,689 --> 01:22:29,843
There will be drama for few days on LOC.

961
01:22:29,867 --> 01:22:32,443
Our actors and singers will be banned.

962
01:22:32,581 --> 01:22:34,210
The stock market will
get slightly up and down.

963
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:36,031
Then everything will go back to normal.

964
01:22:37,468 --> 01:22:40,465
But we should not underestimate the enemy.

965
01:22:40,605 --> 01:22:42,205
We cannot not repeat this mistake again.

966
01:22:42,322 --> 01:22:43,493
- Zubair?
- Yes Sir?

967
01:22:43,519 --> 01:22:44,597
- Afzal?
- Yes Sir?

968
01:22:44,706 --> 01:22:46,458
I want the slightest news.

969
01:22:46,599 --> 01:22:49,377
Any number of weapons that you
can send to the Kashmir border.

970
01:22:49,494 --> 01:22:52,505
Our retaliation should not be
any lesser.

971
01:22:52,763 --> 01:22:53,889
Is that understood?

972
01:22:54,007 --> 01:22:55,128
- Yes Sir.
- That's good.

973
01:23:01,059 --> 01:23:02,872
What happened in your meeting today?

974
01:23:03,816 --> 01:23:05,176
Your shots look messed up today.

975
01:23:05,303 --> 01:23:07,913
The talks at the LOC are
getting pretty serious

976
01:23:08,257 --> 01:23:11,121
Indians are making us work hard.

977
01:23:12,465 --> 01:23:15,066
Today there were some important decisions
in the meeting.

978
01:23:15,668 --> 01:23:16,798
Anyways!

979
01:23:17,259 --> 01:23:18,259
Check my shot now.

980
01:23:21,028 --> 01:23:22,561
See this blow.

981
01:23:29,254 --> 01:23:30,254
No Zameer.

982
01:23:31,135 --> 01:23:32,879
Today, you are very distracted.

983
01:23:33,027 --> 01:23:34,027
Let's do this.

984
01:23:34,266 --> 01:23:35,266
Come to my house today

985
01:23:35,548 --> 01:23:37,937
I'll tell my wife to make you
some Biryani.

986
01:23:38,014 --> 01:23:39,419
And some sweets.

987
01:23:39,473 --> 01:23:40,554
No, not today.

988
01:23:41,304 --> 01:23:43,848
Today have to stay awake all night
to work alongside major

989
01:23:44,682 --> 01:23:45,682
and Tomorrow.

990
01:23:46,081 --> 01:23:48,144
Maybe will have to visit LOC.

991
01:23:48,895 --> 01:23:50,396
We will plan it some other day.

992
01:23:51,017 --> 01:23:52,583
Do you have any other plans on 28th?

993
01:23:52,607 --> 01:23:53,607
On the night of 28th?

994
01:23:53,711 --> 01:23:54,577
!Yes bro

995
01:23:54,646 --> 01:23:56,361
28th sounds good sure?

996
01:23:56,573 --> 01:23:57,658
- Yes bro.
- For sure.

997
01:23:57,863 --> 01:23:59,183
Let's go look for the ball.

998
01:24:37,191 --> 01:24:39,904
Can you get me a closer shot?
Yes, Sure-

999
01:24:51,787 --> 01:24:52,920
Go to the right.

1000
01:25:04,501 --> 01:25:06,595
Good job Ishaan. good job!

1001
01:25:27,593 --> 01:25:28,593
Hey

1002
01:25:29,038 --> 01:25:30,038
come and sit.

1003
01:25:39,854 --> 01:25:41,340
Get it out now, Ishaan!

1004
01:25:41,434 --> 01:25:42,501
I'm trying

1005
01:26:33,458 --> 01:26:35,728
Ishaan!
Come on!

1006
01:26:35,904 --> 01:26:36,904
Come on!

1007
01:27:00,270 --> 01:27:01,270
Toy!

1008
01:27:14,481 --> 01:27:15,692
Yes Yes

1009
01:27:15,911 --> 01:27:17,021
try! come on Ishaan!

1010
01:27:44,594 --> 01:27:46,730
Sir this is B2 launchpad and
training center

1011
01:27:46,754 --> 01:27:48,927
from where terrorists for Uri attack came

1012
01:27:48,952 --> 01:27:51,122
38 highly trained terrorists.

1013
01:27:51,147 --> 01:27:53,399
Two floor building
and 5 exit points.

1014
01:27:54,415 --> 01:27:57,454
This information is confirmed
by our intelligence office?

1015
01:27:57,479 --> 01:27:58,479
Yes Sir

1016
01:27:58,613 --> 01:28:01,163
I personally checked each and
every launchpad.

1017
01:28:03,934 --> 01:28:05,497
What is the plan of the attack?

1018
01:28:06,121 --> 01:28:08,121
Sir Our 80 commandos are ready

1019
01:28:08,332 --> 01:28:09,871
28th night, 12th hour.

1020
01:28:10,098 --> 01:28:11,830
When our defenses are
at their peak.

1021
01:28:12,025 --> 01:28:15,627
Then from our forward post by
4 MI-17 helicopters

1022
01:28:15,768 --> 01:28:17,568
we will enter POK
<i>(Pakistan occupied Kashmir)</i>

1023
01:28:17,647 --> 01:28:19,916
And exactly at 2am we
will start our attack!

1024
01:28:20,143 --> 01:28:22,775
Our 80 commandos are divided into 4 teams.

1025
01:28:22,944 --> 01:28:25,838
Each team includes twenty people
Each team must eliminate two targets

1026
01:28:26,010 --> 01:28:27,010
Alpha team.

1027
01:28:27,084 --> 01:28:28,702
Along with Major Wihan
they will get B1

1028
01:28:28,726 --> 01:28:29,819
and after that.

1029
01:28:30,007 --> 01:28:31,377
Jabbar and Idris's

1030
01:28:31,666 --> 01:28:33,431
they will destroy B2 launchpad

1031
01:28:33,650 --> 01:28:34,650
similarly

1032
01:28:34,704 --> 01:28:36,319
Tim Bravo, Charlie and Delta

1033
01:28:36,390 --> 01:28:38,856
in Leepa, Bhimber and Kiel.

1034
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:40,621
Destroy their targets.

1035
01:28:40,699 --> 01:28:43,954
The positive thing is that all the targets
are nearby LOC.

1036
01:28:44,509 --> 01:28:46,788
That means from landing to take off,

1037
01:28:46,819 --> 01:28:50,663
This all operation will be completed
in 45-50 minutes

1038
01:28:50,710 --> 01:28:51,710
which means

1039
01:28:51,746 --> 01:28:54,496
that by 3 am we should
be back in our choppers

1040
01:28:54,777 --> 01:28:55,777
and by 5am

1041
01:28:56,720 --> 01:28:58,636
our soldiers will reach our Srinagar base.

1042
01:29:01,890 --> 01:29:03,496
Tomorrow there will be no meeting here.

1043
01:29:04,610 --> 01:29:07,938
As you all are told
in front of press and public.

1044
01:29:08,497 --> 01:29:09,894
You should carry out a normal day.

1045
01:29:10,113 --> 01:29:12,241
On 28th night.

1046
01:29:12,335 --> 01:29:14,521
We don't want anyone from our ministry
here in the defence building.

1047
01:29:14,571 --> 01:29:16,621
Apart from military intelligence

1048
01:29:16,988 --> 01:29:19,254
Arjun and Govind has my permission
to stay here.

1049
01:29:19,697 --> 01:29:21,746
Vihan when are you leaving for Kashmir?

1050
01:29:22,082 --> 01:29:24,579
Sir, we will leave from northern command
tomorrow morning.

1051
01:29:25,134 --> 01:29:30,496
I heard that you promised that you will
bring all the troops alive and well?

1052
01:29:31,590 --> 01:29:32,590
-Sir.

1053
01:29:32,746 --> 01:29:33,746
-With your permission.

1054
01:29:34,457 --> 01:29:38,246
Me and my commandos on the 30th of night
would like to have dinner with you.

1055
01:29:42,311 --> 01:29:43,311
Long live India.

1056
01:29:43,918 --> 01:29:45,185
Long live India, Sir.

1057
01:29:57,910 --> 01:29:58,910
Captain Vaid!

1058
01:29:59,878 --> 01:30:00,878
Akram

1059
01:30:01,941 --> 01:30:02,941
Bali

1060
01:30:03,910 --> 01:30:05,297
you three will lead bravo

1061
01:30:05,321 --> 01:30:06,321
Charlie.

1062
01:30:06,527 --> 01:30:07,913
And Delta.

1063
01:30:08,882 --> 01:30:10,954
As soon as we para drop in PoK.

1064
01:30:11,243 --> 01:30:12,546
We all will be easy targets

1065
01:30:13,234 --> 01:30:14,281
that's why everyone.

1066
01:30:14,913 --> 01:30:16,246
Be careful,

1067
01:30:16,408 --> 01:30:17,408
stealthily.

1068
01:30:17,561 --> 01:30:19,871
Must reach their target
launchpads.

1069
01:30:20,324 --> 01:30:21,324
Once we reached.

1070
01:30:21,455 --> 01:30:22,455
Again.

1071
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,165
Outer parameters sniper.

1072
01:30:24,366 --> 01:30:26,208
Inner parameters assaulters.

1073
01:30:26,731 --> 01:30:28,586
Each team will have a signal jammer

1074
01:30:28,805 --> 01:30:30,588
so that during the attack.

1075
01:30:30,830 --> 01:30:32,751
Terrorist wont use radio signal

1076
01:30:33,228 --> 01:30:34,800
and mobile calls.

1077
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:37,852
Remember boys!

1078
01:30:38,246 --> 01:30:39,246
Our return

1079
01:30:39,443 --> 01:30:40,598
is the toughest part

1080
01:30:41,106 --> 01:30:43,371
our backs will face enemies.

1081
01:30:44,105 --> 01:30:45,621
And they shooting from behind.

1082
01:30:45,918 --> 01:30:47,030
So we have to be quick.

1083
01:30:47,843 --> 01:30:49,871
Is there a question?
NoSir.

1084
01:30:50,551 --> 01:30:53,121
I promised that you all
will return to India. Alive!

1085
01:30:53,559 --> 01:30:55,675
And bloody well intend to
keep my promise.

1086
01:30:56,724 --> 01:30:58,247
Long live India-
Long live India-

1087
01:31:06,204 --> 01:31:09,079
Muzaffarabad and Kkel's assets
have updated us.

1088
01:31:09,754 --> 01:31:11,754
Its reported that India will
enhance their defence.

1089
01:31:11,816 --> 01:31:13,746
Across the border.

1090
01:31:13,771 --> 01:31:14,771
Excuse me.

1091
01:31:16,069 --> 01:31:17,069
Sir!

1092
01:31:34,785 --> 01:31:35,785
Commandos!

1093
01:31:36,324 --> 01:31:37,324
It's time!

1094
01:31:38,559 --> 01:31:40,372
To make them bleed for their deeds.

1095
01:31:41,582 --> 01:31:43,871
They want Kashmir and
we want their head.

1096
01:31:46,496 --> 01:31:48,297
Are you ready for the boys? -
Yes Sir-

1097
01:31:48,415 --> 01:31:51,205
- How's the Spirit?!
- High Sir!

1098
01:31:51,517 --> 01:31:52,941
- Long live India.
- Long live India.

1099
01:31:52,991 --> 01:31:53,991
Go! Go! Go!
All the best!

1100
01:33:12,483 --> 01:33:13,858
It was very dark.

1101
01:33:14,483 --> 01:33:15,889
We were also very scared.

1102
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:19,746
How should we know baby's
belly can also get blown.

1103
01:33:31,272 --> 01:33:32,272

Come on! why are you
working so much in kitchen!

1108
01:33:43,301 --> 01:33:44,541
We are getting bored here.

01:33:44,834 --> 01:33:46,338
Come Sit with us.

1110
01:33:46,518 --> 01:33:50,579
Zameer ji while cooking biryani
we cannot do 2 works at a time.

1111
01:33:51,008 --> 01:33:52,255
Just few more minutes.

1112
01:33:56,060 --> 01:33:58,087
Today you are looking a lot better

1113
01:33:58,689 --> 01:34:00,714
you were looking distracted
from so many days.

1114
01:34:00,902 --> 01:34:02,175
What can I say

1115
01:34:02,619 --> 01:34:04,635
Indians are bothering us so much.

1116
01:34:05,166 --> 01:34:07,930
Don't know what other plans they
have with border defence.

1117
01:34:09,182 --> 01:34:11,183
Our informants are no less though.

1118
01:34:12,488 --> 01:34:14,520
We took all the caution as well.

1119
01:34:28,971 --> 01:34:30,495
Did you taste these Kaggers?

1120
01:34:54,437 --> 01:34:55,437
Thank God.

1121
01:34:56,335 --> 01:34:57,605
Biryani is ready!

1122
01:34:59,107 --> 01:35:02,485
Now make me peg as well

1123
01:35:02,540 --> 01:35:04,069

01:35:04,632 --> 01:35:05,725
And zameer ji.

1125
01:35:06,302 --> 01:35:07,302
How is your wife doing?

1126
01:35:07,622 --> 01:35:08,622
Yeah she.

1127
01:35:08,695 --> 01:35:09,812
She has gone Birmingham.

1128
01:35:10,022 --> 01:35:12,294
Graduation Celebration
of my little kid.

1129
01:35:12,319 --> 01:35:13,210
For that

1130
01:35:13,335 --> 01:35:14,410
I wanted to go as well.

1131
01:35:15,250 --> 01:35:17,333
But the problem at LOC

1132
01:35:17,358 --> 01:35:19,626
has messed up all my programs.

1133
01:35:20,085 --> 01:35:21,503
What can we do.

1134
01:35:27,663 --> 01:35:28,663
Cheers.

1135
01:35:38,377 --> 01:35:39,531
Wait.

1136
01:35:40,367 --> 01:35:42,127
Since when did you
started drinking whiskey?

1137
01:35:43,565 --> 01:35:44,565
What do you mean?

1138
01:35:45,278 --> 01:35:46,278
You.

1139
01:35:47,469 --> 01:35:48,669
You drink wine right?

1140
01:35:52,304 --> 01:35:54,995
Actually the wines caused me migraines.

1141
01:35:55,034 --> 01:35:56,034
So I thought.

1142
01:35:56,343 --> 01:35:57,343
Drink whiskey.

1143
01:36:01,143 --> 01:36:03,366
Oh well, woman who drink whiskey

Central government office.

1147
01:36:45,474 --> 01:36:46,474

01:36:55,205 --> 01:36:56,245

01:37:16,659 --> 01:37:19,038
Today in meeting what was
the decision against India?

01:37:19,366 --> 01:37:22,833
Today at the meeting

1154
01:37:23,138 --> 01:37:25,419

1155
01:37:25,607 --> 01:37:26,607

Wife! what are you doing to me? -

1157
01:37:35,725 --> 01:37:37,610
What was the decision today at meeting?

1158
01:37:38,173 --> 01:37:39,652
Nothing.

1159
01:37:39,706 --> 01:37:41,323
What did the minister say?

1160
01:37:41,435 --> 01:37:42,435
Zameer!!

1161
01:37:44,969 --> 01:37:46,857
The informants told us that

1162
01:37:47,076 --> 01:37:48,567
near the border.

1163
01:37:48,945 --> 01:37:52,530
Helicopters painted as Pakistani
helicopters were spotted.

1164
01:37:52,630 --> 01:37:54,412
Helicopters were painted Sir

1165
01:37:54,840 --> 01:37:57,047
maybe to escape the radar.

1166
01:37:57,072 --> 01:37:59,828
They fly at low altitude and
attack our forward post.

1167
01:37:59,900 --> 01:38:01,663
How should we stop them?

1168
01:38:01,688 --> 01:38:02,568
Excellency.

1169
01:38:02,686 --> 01:38:05,710
We need to launch A-Vac radar
from Uri sector.

1170
01:38:05,829 --> 01:38:08,364
After than even if by mistake
enemies helicopter

1171
01:38:08,388 --> 01:38:10,402
come close to border at least 20 feet

1172
01:38:10,813 --> 01:38:13,871
then our anti aircraft missiles
will shoot it down.

1173
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:25,759
Hello

1174
01:38:25,783 --> 01:38:27,454
Alpha team needs to abort the mission

1175
01:38:27,478 --> 01:38:30,496
I repeat
Alpha team operations should be stopped.

1176
01:38:30,543 --> 01:38:31,543
What.

1177
01:38:43,261 --> 01:38:44,261
Sir!

1178
01:38:50,596 --> 01:38:52,839
We detect air activity at LOC.

1179
01:38:53,011 --> 01:38:54,800
Prepare anti-aircraft missiles.

1180
01:39:03,034 --> 01:39:04,752
- Sir?
- Palavi!

1181
01:39:04,822 --> 01:39:06,228
Vihan's chopper already left?

1182
01:39:06,267 --> 01:39:07,173
Yes Sir.

1183
01:39:07,271 --> 01:39:08,981
They will cross LOC in 10 seconds.

1184
01:39:09,056 --> 01:39:10,321
Connect me to Vihan now!

1185
01:39:10,392 --> 01:39:12,401
Vihan!
I'll patch you to govind Sir.

1186
01:39:12,641 --> 01:39:13,902
Sir!
Vihan is online.

1187
01:39:13,995 --> 01:39:16,314
Vihan do not cross LOC!

1188
01:39:16,424 --> 01:39:18,665
I repeat! Do not cross the border.

1189
01:39:18,736 --> 01:39:20,033
Turn around the chopper!

1190
01:39:20,139 --> 01:39:21,159
Turn around Turn around.

1191
01:39:36,373 --> 01:39:39,637
Vihan they have launched Evac radar
in muzaffarabad sector.

1192
01:39:39,757 --> 01:39:42,514
So Alpha team cannot cross by air.

1193
01:39:42,639 --> 01:39:44,016
You have to abort the mission.

1194
01:40:02,298 --> 01:40:03,365
Palavi listen.

1195
01:40:03,804 --> 01:40:05,592
During the interrogation
Farook told us

1196
01:40:05,616 --> 01:40:08,915
they brought terrorists in India
via caves.

1197
01:40:08,979 --> 01:40:10,720
That our army is monitoring.

1198
01:40:10,751 --> 01:40:12,566
Send me its exact coordinates.

1199
01:40:12,754 --> 01:40:15,548
If we cannot go through the air
we will go through the land

1200
01:40:15,711 --> 01:40:18,467
but in any way we will
complete this mission today.

1201
01:40:18,675 --> 01:40:20,052
Bravo charlie delta.

1202
01:40:20,844 --> 01:40:22,580
Follow the plan.

1203
01:40:22,627 --> 01:40:25,267
From this moment there will be
radio silence between us 4 teams

1204
01:40:25,343 --> 01:40:27,991
we will only be in touch with army
intelligence directly

1205
01:40:28,015 --> 01:40:29,015
they will keep me posted.

1206
01:40:29,235 --> 01:40:30,235
You're right.

1207
01:40:30,315 --> 01:40:31,689
Bravo charlie delta.

1208
01:40:32,150 --> 01:40:34,816
According to the information your
areas are completely safe.

1209
01:40:34,949 --> 01:40:36,460
So move ahead as planned.

1210
01:40:36,856 --> 01:40:37,856
Whats the status?

1211
01:40:37,925 --> 01:40:39,485
Sir we have figured out the coordinates

1212
01:41:03,552 --> 01:41:04,888
thank you welcome Sir

1213
01:41:07,729 --> 01:41:08,729
!let's go.

1214
01:41:08,767 --> 01:41:12,084
Sir entering a cave blindly without
monitoring

1215
01:41:12,108 --> 01:41:13,397
this is way too risky.

1216
01:41:20,889 --> 01:41:24,199
Rangers, terrorists
anyone can be guarding these caves.

1217
01:41:44,162 --> 01:41:45,162
Vihan wait!

1218
01:41:46,757 --> 01:41:48,538
Ishaan online?
Can he hear our voice?

1219
01:41:48,562 --> 01:41:49,482
Yes, Sir he can.

1220
01:41:49,507 --> 01:41:51,096
- Ishaan.
- Yes Sir?

1221
01:41:51,112 --> 01:41:54,233
Can you see GPS of all the
4 teams?

1222
01:41:54,319 --> 01:41:55,319
Yes Sir I can see it

1223
01:41:55,564 --> 01:41:58,358
that's good
from now on you are going to be their eyes.

1224
01:41:58,559 --> 01:42:03,071
Tell all the operators, all the 4 guards
will stay few meters ahead of team leaders.

1225
01:42:03,102 --> 01:42:05,740
And you keep tracking
their position by GPS.

1226
01:42:05,779 --> 01:42:08,619
As soon as you see any danger
warn the team leader.

1227
01:42:08,736 --> 01:42:09,736
Sure, Sir.

1228
01:42:51,371 --> 01:42:52,371
Sir!

1229
01:43:19,268 --> 01:43:20,150
Sir.

1230
01:43:20,190 --> 01:43:21,691
We are in Pakistan occupied Kashmir.

1231
01:43:21,816 --> 01:43:22,843
Good job Vihan!

1232
01:43:22,859 --> 01:43:25,362
Other teams are reaching their
primary targets as well!

1233
01:45:16,750 --> 01:45:17,750
Kunal!

1234
01:45:24,986 --> 01:45:26,483
Get your gun fast.

1235
01:45:27,658 --> 01:45:29,486
Get a quick look.

1236
01:47:39,335 --> 01:47:41,409
Say hello to your 72 virgins..

1237
01:47:42,307 --> 01:47:44,078
..and ask them to hold
the celebrations on.

1238
01:47:45,258 --> 01:47:47,298
We plan to help them with
a lot more guests tonight.

1239
01:47:52,343 --> 01:47:53,863
Sir
The first operation was successful.

1240
01:47:54,043 --> 01:47:55,603
We have destroyed B1 launchpad.

1241
01:47:55,861 --> 01:47:57,194
What's the status of other teams?

1242
01:47:57,319 --> 01:48:00,136
Bravo and Charlie have attacked
their secondary location.

1243
01:48:00,215 --> 01:48:03,261
Delta's mission is complete
and is about to return.

1244
01:48:03,300 --> 01:48:04,641
Not a single casualty

1245
01:48:04,699 --> 01:48:05,433
that's good

1246
01:48:05,621 --> 01:48:06,621

1247
01:48:07,815 --> 01:48:08,947

Where is Idris.

1254
01:57:35,060 --> 01:57:36,060
Where is Idris

1255
01:57:41,332 --> 01:57:43,007
!Camera

1256
01:58:57,021 --> 01:58:58,208

Not yet Sir!

1258
01:58:59,579 --> 01:59:01,213
I think he is not here.

1259
01:59:02,964 --> 01:59:03,964
He is here.

1260
01:59:27,298 --> 01:59:28,848
Someone alerted the police.

1261
01:59:28,878 --> 01:59:29,878
They are just two minutes away.

1262
01:59:29,923 --> 01:59:30,923
Vihan!
Be quick.

1263
01:59:31,501 --> 01:59:32,501

The Indian Army.

Vihan.

1282
02:05:25,688 --> 02:05:27,730
We are sending jets for your covering fire.

1283
02:05:27,770 --> 02:05:29,710
It will take up to 10
minutes for them to reach!

1284
