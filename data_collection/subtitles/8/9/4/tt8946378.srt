2
00:01:43,357 --> 00:01:45,659
Morning, Mr. Thrombey.

3
00:01:59,028 --> 00:02:01,605
Mr. Thrombey, you up there?

4
00:02:01,992 --> 00:02:04,282
Mr. Thrombey, I'm coming in.

5
00:02:14,994 --> 00:02:16,356
Shit!

6
00:02:37,088 --> 00:02:40,428
<i>You killed him! You bastard!
You murdered him!</i>

7
00:02:40,428 --> 00:02:41,902
<i>I didn't murder nobody.</i>

8
00:02:41,902 --> 00:02:45,745
<i>You slashed his face open and you left him
bleeding in the street, like a stuffed pig.</i>

9
00:02:45,745 --> 00:02:50,423
<i>Then you crushed his skull with a forklift and
burnt his hands off to erase the fingerprints.</i>

10
00:02:50,423 --> 00:02:51,547
<i>You'll never prove it.</i>

11
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:53,730
<i>We have the nanny cam footage!</i>

12
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,843
Alice, turn that off now, please.

13
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:56,911
Why? It's almost over.

14
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:58,050
Now, please. Just turn that off.

15
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,042
They're finding out who did it,
and the WiFi sucks in my room...

16
00:03:00,042 --> 00:03:02,943
Turn it off now! Alice! Off!

17
00:03:02,943 --> 00:03:05,249
There isn't even anything bad on it,
it's just normal TV...

18
00:03:05,249 --> 00:03:07,564
They're talking murder on it!

19
00:03:07,564 --> 00:03:11,143
Your sister just had a friend
she loves slit his throat open,

20
00:03:11,143 --> 00:03:13,155
and she doesn't need
to be hearing that right now!

21
00:03:13,155 --> 00:03:15,119
Let's be sensitive!

22
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:21,262
Alice, you can keep watching
your show, it's fine.

23
00:03:21,262 --> 00:03:23,206
No, I guessed who did it anyway.

24
00:03:23,206 --> 00:03:25,901
- I'm sorry Marta.
- It's okay.

25
00:03:27,647 --> 00:03:29,411
It's Harlan's son.

26
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,622
Hi, Walt.

27
00:03:33,622 --> 00:03:35,480
Hi, Martha. It's Walt.

28
00:03:35,654 --> 00:03:37,460
Would you mind
coming to the house early?

29
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,749
The police have
a few more questions for everybody.

30
00:03:40,962 --> 00:03:42,656
What?

31
00:04:01,934 --> 00:04:05,174
Hey! Excuse me ma'am.
You with the help?

32
00:04:05,174 --> 00:04:07,865
Hey! Her name is Marta.
She was granddad's nurse.

33
00:04:07,865 --> 00:04:10,261
She's with us. "The help?"

34
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,681
It's okay. I'm sorry.

35
00:04:12,745 --> 00:04:15,359
No. It's not okay.
What the hell?

36
00:04:24,893 --> 00:04:26,420
How are you doing?

37
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,786
Not very good. Alone.

38
00:04:31,482 --> 00:04:35,687
Lots of days,
and not knowing what to do next.

39
00:04:36,036 --> 00:04:39,012
Martha, anything you need.

40
00:04:39,774 --> 00:04:41,807
You're part of this family.

41
00:04:43,304 --> 00:04:44,312
Thank you.

42
00:04:46,156 --> 00:04:48,502
- How are you doing kiddo?
- Linda.

43
00:04:49,272 --> 00:04:50,778
How are you?

44
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:56,127
You know, the funeral helped, I guess.
Just seeing him.

45
00:04:56,427 --> 00:04:59,222
I thought you should've been there.
I was out voted.

46
00:04:59,222 --> 00:05:01,321
Get arrested.
Die up your own ass for all I care!

47
00:05:01,321 --> 00:05:02,965
Richard.

48
00:05:03,285 --> 00:05:04,797
He's not coming.

49
00:05:05,567 --> 00:05:08,811
Ransom. Little shit.
Missed the funeral.

50
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:10,589
Excuse me.

51
00:05:11,024 --> 00:05:13,740
We're ready for you now.
We'd like to see you one at a time.

52
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,975
All right. I'll go first.

53
00:05:15,975 --> 00:05:20,163
I'm assuming this will all be wrapped up
before the memorial tonight.

54
00:05:20,443 --> 00:05:22,173
We'll do our best, ma'am.

55
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:27,411
So, how are you doing kiddo?

56
00:05:28,743 --> 00:05:31,315
We're just gonna reintroduce
ourselves as a formality.

57
00:05:31,315 --> 00:05:34,810
I am Detective Lieutenant Elliott,
and this is Trooper Wagner.

58
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:40,044
Now, I'm going to record,
this just to make things easier.

59
00:05:40,327 --> 00:05:42,578
All right, we're with Linda Drysdale,
nee Thrombey,

60
00:05:43,084 --> 00:05:44,954
Harlan Thrombey's eldest daughter,

61
00:05:45,923 --> 00:05:48,313
in discussing the events
that took place the night of his demise,

62
00:05:48,313 --> 00:05:50,702
one week ago, November 8th.

63
00:05:50,702 --> 00:05:52,928
We're very sorry for your loss.

64
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,673
Thank you. That means a lot.

65
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,000
So, we understand at that night
the family had gathered

66
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,130
to celebrate
your father's 85th birthday.

67
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,382
Yes.

68
00:06:03,382 --> 00:06:04,594
How was it?

69
00:06:04,985 --> 00:06:07,488
The party? Pre my dad's death?

70
00:06:08,304 --> 00:06:09,819
It was great.

71
00:06:10,276 --> 00:06:12,761
Did anyone besides the family
show face?

72
00:06:13,396 --> 00:06:15,135
Fran, the housekeeper.

73
00:06:15,135 --> 00:06:18,467
He was a nice guy,
but he was so hairy.

74
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:21,298
And I dated Italian guys,
you know what I mean.

75
00:06:22,217 --> 00:06:26,506
Marta, Harlan's caregiver,
good girl, hard worker.

76
00:06:26,796 --> 00:06:28,686
Family's from Ecuador.

77
00:06:29,146 --> 00:06:33,040
And Wanetta - Greatnana,
Harlan's mom.

78
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,075
Hi Nana.

79
00:06:34,075 --> 00:06:37,344
His mom? How old is she?

80
00:06:37,968 --> 00:06:39,419
We have no idea.

81
00:06:39,723 --> 00:06:43,188
Okay, and your son Ransom,
did he attend as well?

82
00:06:43,312 --> 00:06:45,074
Yes, but he left early.

83
00:06:45,748 --> 00:06:48,941
Ransom, are you leaving?

84
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,838
Right, would you say that all three of you
showed up around the same time?

85
00:06:59,911 --> 00:07:01,277
No.

86
00:07:02,931 --> 00:07:06,373
Richard came early
to help the caterers set up.

87
00:07:06,573 --> 00:07:10,494
Okay, and you and your husband Richard
work at a real estate firm in Boston?

88
00:07:10,494 --> 00:07:12,388
No, it's my company.

89
00:07:12,388 --> 00:07:13,942
Right, right. Sorry.

90
00:07:13,942 --> 00:07:15,924
I built my business
from the ground up.

91
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:19,158
Just like your father.
You two were very close?

92
00:07:20,656 --> 00:07:23,869
We had our own secret way
of communicating.

93
00:07:23,994 --> 00:07:26,847
You had to find that with dad.

94
00:07:27,018 --> 00:07:28,893
You had to find a game
to play with him.

95
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:32,903
And if you did that,
and you played by his rules...

96
00:07:38,322 --> 00:07:41,052
Everyone idolizes their dad, right?

97
00:07:41,174 --> 00:07:42,945
I don't know, do they?

98
00:07:43,989 --> 00:07:47,298
Very much not,
don't know why I said that.

99
00:07:48,071 --> 00:07:50,004
But my wife, Linda, does.

100
00:07:50,004 --> 00:07:52,412
Harlan started out
with a rusty Smith-Corona,

101
00:07:52,412 --> 00:07:56,814
and built himself into one of the
bestselling mystery writers of all time.

102
00:07:56,814 --> 00:08:01,203
Wow, seems like all his kids
are self-made overachievers.

103
00:08:03,012 --> 00:08:04,487
Sure.

104
00:08:04,636 --> 00:08:09,183
For the record, I'm speaking with Walt
Thrombey, Harlan Thrombey's youngest son.

105
00:08:09,183 --> 00:08:11,681
So, you run
your father's publishing company?

106
00:08:11,681 --> 00:08:12,531
Yeah.

107
00:08:12,531 --> 00:08:14,368
It's my - it's our...

108
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:17,764
It's the family's publishing company,
dad trusts me to run it.

109
00:08:18,761 --> 00:08:24,019
30 languages, over 80 million
copies sold. A real legacy.

110
00:08:24,854 --> 00:08:25,945
You guys fans?

111
00:08:25,945 --> 00:08:28,316
I mean, I don't do
much fiction reading myself.

112
00:08:28,316 --> 00:08:30,822
Big fan. I'm big fan.
I mean...

113
00:08:30,822 --> 00:08:33,401
His plots are just like...
I got one spoiler for you,

114
00:08:33,401 --> 00:08:36,873
But, okay, like "A Thousand Knives",
the cow and the shotgun,

115
00:08:36,873 --> 00:08:39,296
like, where do you
come up with that?

116
00:08:39,516 --> 00:08:42,785
Dad said the plots just popped into
his head fully formed.

117
00:08:42,785 --> 00:08:44,676
It was the easy part for him.

118
00:08:47,063 --> 00:08:48,689
So, you're in the area, right?

119
00:08:48,689 --> 00:08:51,234
You guys probably arrived
around the same time?

120
00:08:53,063 --> 00:08:54,923
We all got here around 8.

121
00:08:55,391 --> 00:08:57,569
My wife Donna, she's my rock.

122
00:08:59,501 --> 00:09:01,651
Jesus! Donna. Are you all right?

123
00:09:02,111 --> 00:09:07,650
My son Jacob, he's 16.
Very politically active.

124
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,350
The boy is literally a Nazi.

125
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,439
He's an alt-right troll dipshit.

126
00:09:11,756 --> 00:09:14,276
Kids today, with the internet.
It's amazing.

127
00:09:15,379 --> 00:09:16,849
So, the night went well?

128
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:22,968
I mean, we're all gutted, but I was happy
to have that night with him.

129
00:09:22,968 --> 00:09:27,664
To be by his side, to think about our books
and what we've accomplished with them.

130
00:09:28,156 --> 00:09:31,125
It's like I can still feel
his hand on my shoulder.

131
00:09:32,517 --> 00:09:34,147
Passing the torch.

132
00:09:34,147 --> 00:09:38,782
So, we're here with Joni Thrombey,
Harlan Thrombey's daughter in law?

133
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,331
Yeah, I married his son Neil.
We had one daughter, Meg.

134
00:09:43,609 --> 00:09:47,222
And then Neil passed on,
15 years ago.

135
00:09:47,482 --> 00:09:49,571
And you remained close
to the Thrombeys.

136
00:09:49,571 --> 00:09:51,697
Oh, they're my family.

137
00:09:55,121 --> 00:09:57,581
I feel simultaneously freed by

138
00:09:58,996 --> 00:10:01,440
and supported by them.

139
00:10:05,048 --> 00:10:08,200
It's that balance of opposites
that's the nugget of Flam.

140
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,417
Sorry, the Nugget of...?

141
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:11,723
Flam.

142
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,874
Yeah, Flam, your skin care
company. Sorry.

143
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,610
I forgive you.

144
00:10:17,087 --> 00:10:20,171
Yeah, it's skin care,
but it promotes a total lifestyle.

145
00:10:20,171 --> 00:10:24,079
Self sufficiency with an acknowledgment
of human need.

146
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,103
That's Flam, but it's also Harlan.

147
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:29,627
He got me and Meg
through some tough times.

148
00:10:29,887 --> 00:10:31,554
Granddad gives my mom
a yearly allowance,

149
00:10:31,554 --> 00:10:35,154
and he's never missed
wiring a tuition payment to my schools.

150
00:10:36,773 --> 00:10:39,439
He's a genuinely selfless man.

151
00:10:40,013 --> 00:10:41,991
But, you left his party early?

152
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:42,929
Have fun.

153
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:44,357
To see some friends at Smith.

154
00:10:44,357 --> 00:10:48,073
You know, Dad pays
for her crypto-Marxist

155
00:10:48,073 --> 00:10:52,669
postdeconstructual feminist
poetry theory whatever major.

156
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:55,449
She could've stuck around
for the cake.

157
00:10:55,545 --> 00:10:57,595
I think Linda was upset.

158
00:11:01,009 --> 00:11:02,867
But Harlan understood.

159
00:11:06,968 --> 00:11:08,130
Right.

160
00:11:08,648 --> 00:11:11,683
You two showed up to the party
around the same time?

161
00:11:11,683 --> 00:11:14,973
If I could pause.
Because I just...

162
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,902
Who is that guy?
And why are we doing all this? Again?

163
00:11:18,902 --> 00:11:20,585
This is just follow up questions,

164
00:11:20,785 --> 00:11:23,898
We're tending to be thorough,
so we can figure out the manner of death.

165
00:11:24,238 --> 00:11:26,845
So by "manner of death"
you mean if someone killed him?

166
00:11:26,845 --> 00:11:29,873
If one of us killed him.
One of his family.

167
00:11:29,873 --> 00:11:31,124
- No, Walt.
- killed him.

168
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:32,871
Is that what
you're suggesting, Lieutenant?

169
00:11:32,871 --> 00:11:35,577
No one is saying that, okay?
This is all pro forma.

170
00:11:35,992 --> 00:11:37,120
Okay.

171
00:11:37,942 --> 00:11:39,653
So, who the fuck is that?

172
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,319
This is Benoit Blanc.

173
00:11:43,887 --> 00:11:45,622
Benoit Blanc?

174
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:49,784
Yes. Mr. Blanc is a private investigator
of great renown.

175
00:11:49,784 --> 00:11:50,913
Wait a minute.

176
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:54,370
I read a tweet
about a New Yorker article about you.

177
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,492
The last of the gentlemen sleuths?

178
00:11:56,492 --> 00:11:59,201
You solved that case
with the tennis champ.

179
00:12:00,061 --> 00:12:01,910
You're famous!

180
00:12:02,405 --> 00:12:05,896
Mr. Blanc is not with the police department,
and not officially involved in the case,

181
00:12:05,896 --> 00:12:07,500
but he's offered to consult.

182
00:12:07,962 --> 00:12:10,020
I happily obliged
and I can vouch for him.

183
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,100
Mr. Blanc, I know who you are.

184
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,540
I read your profile in the New Yorker.
I found it delightful.

185
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:20,885
I just buried my 85 year old father,
who committed suicide.

186
00:12:21,205 --> 00:12:22,949
Why are you here?

187
00:12:24,646 --> 00:12:27,563
I'm here at the behest of a client.

188
00:12:28,238 --> 00:12:29,413
Who?

189
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,067
I cannot say,
but let me assure you this:

190
00:12:34,569 --> 00:12:37,675
my presence will be ornamental.

191
00:12:38,028 --> 00:12:43,591
You will find me a respectful,
quiet, passive observer

192
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,244
of the truth.

193
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,073
Fine. Are we getting there?

194
00:12:50,426 --> 00:12:52,790
Nearly. Harlan's nurse.

195
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,737
She was at the party
in a professional capacity?

196
00:12:55,737 --> 00:12:57,131
Marta?

197
00:12:57,862 --> 00:12:58,989
I guess.

198
00:12:59,298 --> 00:13:02,988
Harlan hired her to be around to take care
of whatever medical needs popped up.

199
00:13:03,655 --> 00:13:06,631
But really she's
like part of the family.

200
00:13:06,909 --> 00:13:09,727
Good kid.
Been a good friend to Harlan.

201
00:13:10,088 --> 00:13:14,203
Family's from Paraguay.
Linda really likes her work ethic.

202
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,421
"Immigrants - we get the job done."

203
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:24,036
- From Hamilton.
- Oh Hamilton!

204
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:25,453
It's so good.

205
00:13:25,453 --> 00:13:27,123
I saw it at the public.

206
00:13:29,324 --> 00:13:30,617
May I just...

207
00:13:31,505 --> 00:13:32,941
Then, I'll recede, but...

208
00:13:33,787 --> 00:13:36,074
As a self-made man myself,

209
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:42,102
I have to express my admiration for how
you've followed in your father's footsteps.

210
00:13:43,413 --> 00:13:44,185
Thank you.

211
00:13:44,185 --> 00:13:47,842
Just marvelous, you know.
The whole family too.

212
00:13:47,985 --> 00:13:52,335
Joni with her thing,
Walt with his publishing empire.

213
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:55,787
Well.

214
00:13:56,946 --> 00:14:02,181
Yes, I mean, Walt, he's done well
with what dad gave him.

215
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,679
Not that it matters, but
really, Dad hands him a book

216
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:08,456
twice a year, and Walt publishes it.

217
00:14:09,914 --> 00:14:10,836
It's just not the same.

218
00:14:10,836 --> 00:14:16,796
But, surely, Walt runs the merchandising,
adaptations, film and television rights...

219
00:14:17,296 --> 00:14:19,427
Are you baiting me, Detective?

220
00:14:20,414 --> 00:14:21,993
You know he doesn't.

221
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,543
And you think I am dumb enough

222
00:14:24,543 --> 00:14:27,861
to be baited into talking
family business,

223
00:14:27,861 --> 00:14:33,190
into shit talking my baby brother in front
of a police detective and a state trooper...

224
00:14:33,353 --> 00:14:35,415
Walt doesn't run shit!

225
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:38,093
Because there are no
TV and film rights.

226
00:14:38,484 --> 00:14:41,362
Harlan's never allowed
any adaptations of his books.

227
00:14:41,521 --> 00:14:43,552
- Hated the idea.
- No!

228
00:14:43,908 --> 00:14:46,450
Yeah! Drives Walt nuts.

229
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,658
'Cause that's where the real money is.

230
00:14:49,107 --> 00:14:53,013
Walt would get a little Irish courage
in him, he'd get into it with Harlan.

231
00:14:53,302 --> 00:14:55,856
Did he get "into it" at the party?

232
00:14:56,206 --> 00:14:57,532
Oh my God!

233
00:14:57,532 --> 00:14:58,516
Come one, Dad!

234
00:14:58,516 --> 00:15:02,516
He wouldn't leave him alone, the poor guy.
Harlan finally had to give him the hook.

235
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:07,430
I didn't hear what he said,
but he must've really handed him his lunch.

236
00:15:07,608 --> 00:15:11,100
'Cause Walt was like a wounded puppy
the rest of the night.

237
00:15:11,306 --> 00:15:14,812
What? Richard said what?
No, Jesus, we did not get "into it."

238
00:15:14,812 --> 00:15:17,689
I'm just trying to get
an accurate impression.

239
00:15:18,555 --> 00:15:23,232
Harlan took you aside at the party,
when you returned you were chastened.

240
00:15:26,577 --> 00:15:28,143
What did Harlan say to you?

241
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:33,097
The Netflix guys, their business
affairs guy, he sent something over,

242
00:15:33,097 --> 00:15:35,955
it's hard numbers this time,
and I just think this is a window,

243
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,763
that's not gonna stay open,
we need to take advantage of it,

244
00:15:38,763 --> 00:15:40,733
but then you just need
to look at the numbers.

245
00:15:41,227 --> 00:15:42,584
- Walt.
- Dad!

246
00:15:43,372 --> 00:15:48,388
You put me in charge of our books, let
me be in charge, let me do this! Please.

247
00:15:48,423 --> 00:15:52,266
They're not our books, son.
They're my books.

248
00:15:53,207 --> 00:15:56,233
And this is not how I wanted
to have this conversation.

249
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,524
But you're right,
you're right, it's...

250
00:15:58,822 --> 00:16:02,358
It's unfair of me to keep you tethered

251
00:16:02,714 --> 00:16:05,387
to something that isn't yours to control.

252
00:16:05,387 --> 00:16:06,728
What?

253
00:16:07,204 --> 00:16:10,337
I've done you a grave disservice.

254
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:14,513
All these years I have kept you from

255
00:16:14,513 --> 00:16:18,302
building something of your own,
that was yours.

256
00:16:20,148 --> 00:16:25,214
But you're not going to be running
the publishing house anymore.

257
00:16:25,894 --> 00:16:27,328
You're free of it.

258
00:16:30,651 --> 00:16:32,456
Dad, are you firing me?

259
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:36,565
We'll talk about details tomorrow.

260
00:16:37,265 --> 00:16:41,238
My mind's made up. Good boy.

261
00:16:49,387 --> 00:16:53,078
We talked, we had a business discussion
about e-books.

262
00:16:54,157 --> 00:16:56,281
Jesus, it was nothing.

263
00:16:57,304 --> 00:17:00,406
You wanna talk about an argument,
hell, Ransom had an argument with him.

264
00:17:00,406 --> 00:17:03,392
Ransom, that's Richard and Linda's son?

265
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:07,326
Look, we all love Ransom,
he's a good kid, we love him.

266
00:17:09,886 --> 00:17:11,162
But?

267
00:17:11,162 --> 00:17:13,463
But he's always been
the black sheep of the family.

268
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:17,908
I'm not trying to... I like to keep
stuff like this in the family,

269
00:17:17,908 --> 00:17:20,974
but with Ransom,
he's never had a job.

270
00:17:21,148 --> 00:17:25,243
And dad for some unknown reason
always supported him.

271
00:17:25,381 --> 00:17:28,815
They have this love hate bond.
They fight.

272
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,250
But that night, God,
they had a blow out.

273
00:17:32,813 --> 00:17:33,898
About what?

274
00:17:33,898 --> 00:17:35,898
Are you, goddamn, insane?

275
00:17:35,911 --> 00:17:38,502
We couldn't make it out really,
but it was huge.

276
00:17:39,081 --> 00:17:42,152
And it's strange they went
into another room to do it.

277
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:46,212
Usually, they like to stoke up drama
in front of the whole family.

278
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:48,448
Speaking of getting into it.

279
00:17:49,451 --> 00:17:52,943
You were at the house early
to help the caterer set up.

280
00:17:53,878 --> 00:17:57,036
Did you converse
with Harlan at that time?

281
00:17:58,064 --> 00:17:59,949
Well, he was there,
we must have spoke.

282
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,624
In his study?

283
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,929
I don't think so.

284
00:18:05,409 --> 00:18:08,117
You see, I spoke with the caterer
this morning.

285
00:18:08,209 --> 00:18:11,031
She didn't see you
helping her staff,

286
00:18:11,031 --> 00:18:16,479
She did hear Harlan in a screaming match
with someone that afternoon in his study.

287
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,882
I don't... A screaming match?

288
00:18:21,152 --> 00:18:22,176
No.

289
00:18:23,616 --> 00:18:26,619
But Joni was here too, she was early.

290
00:18:26,619 --> 00:18:28,982
So, it might have been her,
maybe ask her.

291
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:30,829
These were two male voices.

292
00:18:31,105 --> 00:18:32,975
Harlan shouted the phrase.

293
00:18:32,975 --> 00:18:35,315
You tell her or I will!

294
00:18:35,832 --> 00:18:39,805
"You tell her or I will."

295
00:18:41,545 --> 00:18:43,093
Bells ringing?

296
00:18:51,768 --> 00:18:54,379
That's none of your business.
You stay out of my marriage!

297
00:18:54,379 --> 00:18:57,615
I know my daughter.
And she would want to know.

298
00:18:57,615 --> 00:19:01,725
I've put it all of it in this
letter to her. Tomorrow she gets it.

299
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:05,447
Harlan, I'm warning you.
You stay out of my marriage!

300
00:19:05,447 --> 00:19:07,393
She deserves to know
and you gonna tell her.

301
00:19:07,393 --> 00:19:10,440
- The hell I am.
- You tell her or I will!

302
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,240
Yes. I know.

303
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,185
Yes.

304
00:19:20,676 --> 00:19:25,668
Harlan finally decided to put his mom
in a nursing home.

305
00:19:25,847 --> 00:19:27,642
Linda'd always opposed that.

306
00:19:27,724 --> 00:19:31,497
And I wanted to wait until we got
back from Boston to tell Linda.

307
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:33,923
To avoid the whole scene.

308
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:37,093
And Harlan wanted me
to tell her then.

309
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:39,222
That was it.

310
00:19:39,954 --> 00:19:41,915
Sorry. Forgot.

311
00:19:42,721 --> 00:19:44,079
The house?

312
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:47,362
Early. Richard said you were there.

313
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,931
I was. At the house early.

314
00:19:50,975 --> 00:19:52,442
To see Harlan?

315
00:19:53,597 --> 00:19:56,024
To see Harlan. Yes.

316
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,645
What were you seeing Harlan about?

317
00:20:00,426 --> 00:20:04,769
It was just a mix up
with the payment for Meg's tuition.

318
00:20:06,356 --> 00:20:10,885
I'm sorry to press,
what kind of mix up?

319
00:20:12,852 --> 00:20:16,218
The school hasn't got the check yet,
I don't know why Alan didn't mail it.

320
00:20:16,218 --> 00:20:20,272
Well, Alan didn't mail it
because he caught a discrepancy.

321
00:20:21,335 --> 00:20:26,724
Alan's office has been wiring tuition
directly to the school, as per your request.

322
00:20:26,883 --> 00:20:30,296
But Phyllis's office,
that handles your yearly allowance,

323
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:34,221
has been wiring the tuition money
directly to you as well.

324
00:20:35,287 --> 00:20:39,286
You have been double dipping Meg's tuition,
and stealing from me.

325
00:20:39,859 --> 00:20:44,064
100 thousand dollars a year.
For the past four years.

326
00:20:44,064 --> 00:20:46,457
Harlan, I don't know how this mix up
happened, but...

327
00:20:46,457 --> 00:20:49,537
So, now I am writing this tuition check,

328
00:20:49,694 --> 00:20:55,646
but you must know that this is
the last money you or Meg will get from me.

329
00:20:55,844 --> 00:20:57,197
Please, you don't understand.

330
00:20:57,197 --> 00:21:00,898
Joni, I know it'll hurt,
but it's all for the best.

331
00:21:02,424 --> 00:21:04,350
My mind's made up.

332
00:21:06,753 --> 00:21:10,699
It was a money wiring issue
with the office at the school.

333
00:21:10,829 --> 00:21:14,315
So, I had to ask Harlan
to cut a check for this semester.

334
00:21:14,484 --> 00:21:15,842
No big deal.

335
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,834
Why don't we just take
a little break and we'll resume...

336
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:24,049
She's gone.

337
00:21:30,946 --> 00:21:32,442
Richard.

338
00:21:33,598 --> 00:21:35,068
Joni. Have you seen Richard?

339
00:21:35,068 --> 00:21:36,573
No, I was just in with the...

340
00:21:36,573 --> 00:21:38,164
Okay, thanks.

341
00:21:39,536 --> 00:21:40,868
No.

342
00:21:41,327 --> 00:21:42,981
Goddammit! Richard!

343
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:46,540
Richard.

344
00:22:15,671 --> 00:22:17,653
Son of a bitch!

345
00:22:28,021 --> 00:22:30,782
I might be a victim
of my own expectations here.

346
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:33,866
But when the great Benoit Blanc
comes knocking at my door

347
00:22:34,623 --> 00:22:40,262
I expect it's going to be about something, if
not extraordinary, then at least interesting.

348
00:22:41,303 --> 00:22:44,530
I'm sorry, this is an
open and shut case of suicide and...

349
00:22:45,008 --> 00:22:48,114
Quite frankly, Benny, we're getting to the point
where I need to know what we're doing here.

350
00:22:48,114 --> 00:22:49,719
The method.

351
00:22:50,804 --> 00:22:52,321
Throat slit.

352
00:22:52,901 --> 00:22:54,920
Typical for a suicide?

353
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,577
I mean, that's dramatic. But look around.

354
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,362
I mean, the guy practically lives
in a clue board.

355
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:12,764
You told me
to invite all of these people back

356
00:23:13,113 --> 00:23:15,887
for questioning all over again.
I don't get it.

357
00:23:21,668 --> 00:23:26,136
This is a pleasant family with the usual
quarrels, but no possible motives for murder.

358
00:23:26,435 --> 00:23:28,114
Where are you going?

359
00:23:32,271 --> 00:23:34,878
Harlan Thrombey's nurse, Marta...

360
00:23:35,386 --> 00:23:37,151
- Cabrera.
- Marta Cabrera.

361
00:23:37,151 --> 00:23:39,025
Miss Cabrera, you can just wait inside
and we'll be...

362
00:23:39,025 --> 00:23:40,485
Miss Cabrera.

363
00:23:43,371 --> 00:23:45,313
I've been doing a little poking.

364
00:23:45,955 --> 00:23:49,605
You are hired on a part time basis
as a registered nurse, yes?

365
00:23:49,789 --> 00:23:53,866
Yes, I don't work for a VNA.
Harlan hired me directly.

366
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:55,341
Take a seat, please.

367
00:23:56,034 --> 00:24:01,244
And you're paid a flat rate
for how many hours a week?

368
00:24:02,769 --> 00:24:05,568
Well, I started at 15, and then he...

369
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,088
- He needed more help.
- Medical help?

370
00:24:11,989 --> 00:24:13,601
He needed a friend.

371
00:24:15,841 --> 00:24:19,980
Does having a kind heart
make you a good nurse?

372
00:24:20,393 --> 00:24:22,485
All right, Blanc, I mean.
This is...

373
00:24:22,485 --> 00:24:26,525
Marta, we were just discussing
possible motives in the family.

374
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:31,646
I suspect that Harlan has told you
much unfiltered truth about each of them.

375
00:24:31,646 --> 00:24:34,385
And a little bird has told me,

376
00:24:34,934 --> 00:24:37,238
how should I put this delicately?

377
00:24:38,305 --> 00:24:44,031
You have a regurgitive reaction
to mistruthin'.

378
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,642
Who told you that?

379
00:24:46,642 --> 00:24:48,334
Is it true?

380
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,073
Yes.

381
00:24:52,236 --> 00:24:54,504
It's something I had
since I was a kid.

382
00:24:54,504 --> 00:24:56,694
It's a physically thing that I...

383
00:24:57,032 --> 00:25:00,947
Just the thought of lying,
yeah, it makes me puke.

384
00:25:01,213 --> 00:25:02,627
Really?

385
00:25:06,566 --> 00:25:08,800
Is Richard having an affair?

386
00:25:13,131 --> 00:25:18,886
Why do men instinctively
pull at loose threads on their parachutes?

387
00:25:19,606 --> 00:25:20,932
What?

388
00:25:28,497 --> 00:25:29,910
Richard?

389
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:33,239
An affair?

390
00:25:34,097 --> 00:25:36,444
A <i>yes</i> or <i>no</i> will do.

391
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,925
No.

392
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:45,899
Oh shit!

393
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:49,771
Dear girl I'm sorry. I assumed you
were speaking figuratively.

394
00:25:50,975 --> 00:25:53,666
Here, here. Just take a sip of this.

395
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:55,907
Take that. Quite something.

396
00:25:57,072 --> 00:25:58,974
But I was obviously right.

397
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,205
Richard is having an affair, his
father-in-law found out and confronted him.

398
00:26:03,255 --> 00:26:04,632
"You tell her or I will."

399
00:26:04,632 --> 00:26:06,475
Okay, but even if that was a case...

400
00:26:06,771 --> 00:26:08,258
- You all right?
- Yeah.

401
00:26:08,258 --> 00:26:09,745
Even if that was a case, I mean,

402
00:26:09,745 --> 00:26:12,790
protecting a relationship as a motive,
that's weak sauce, you know that.

403
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:15,064
Well. And then there is Joni.

404
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:17,766
Joni? Lifestyle guru Joni?

405
00:26:17,766 --> 00:26:20,528
No. Harlan was supporting her and her daughter,
and that's the opposite of a motive.

406
00:26:20,528 --> 00:26:23,459
And if that support was threatened?
Miss Cabrera one moment please.

407
00:26:23,459 --> 00:26:24,952
Yes, I just wanna
get some Scope.

408
00:26:24,952 --> 00:26:26,285
Miss Cabrera.

409
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:31,192
Was Harlan planning on
cutting off Joni's allowance?

410
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,353
Oh, Joni.

411
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:38,038
What's up?

412
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,112
Oh my God.

413
00:26:42,288 --> 00:26:43,839
Don't answer that
if you're gonna puke again.

414
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:48,373
Meg said he paid the school directly,
Joni said he sends the money to her.

415
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:50,016
Both were true.

416
00:26:50,362 --> 00:26:55,669
She was pocketing the double payment. Harlan
found out and cut her off without a cent. Yes?

417
00:26:56,254 --> 00:26:59,286
So she bumps him off
for the inheritance?

418
00:26:59,338 --> 00:27:02,425
Come on! No. Have you seen
her insta? She's an influencer.

419
00:27:02,425 --> 00:27:05,655
No. Allowance as a motive?
Again, more weak sauce.

420
00:27:05,878 --> 00:27:07,632
You're just dumping that bag
of weak sauce on it.

421
00:27:07,632 --> 00:27:09,853
Granted. But she lied to me.

422
00:27:10,512 --> 00:27:12,085
All three of them did.

423
00:27:12,085 --> 00:27:13,164
Three?

424
00:27:14,686 --> 00:27:15,854
Walter.

425
00:27:16,838 --> 00:27:18,076
I see where you are going with this.

426
00:27:18,076 --> 00:27:20,814
Harlan had turned Walter down before
regarding film rights.

427
00:27:20,814 --> 00:27:23,725
But that night something Harlan said
shook him.

428
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:27,195
Now, we look at the pattern.
Harlan was cleaning house.

429
00:27:28,303 --> 00:27:29,621
I wonder...

430
00:27:30,031 --> 00:27:32,105
Did he plan to fire Walter?

431
00:27:32,105 --> 00:27:34,386
Can I wait inside?
I feel like I shouldn't be here.

432
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:36,885
Yeah, please just wait inside,
stay close, all right?

433
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:43,783
You have been very patient my friend.

434
00:27:44,793 --> 00:27:47,445
And yes. You are right.

435
00:27:47,445 --> 00:27:51,677
None of these weak alibis and domestic
squibbles answer your question:

436
00:27:51,677 --> 00:27:54,073
Why is Benoit Blanc here?

437
00:27:55,017 --> 00:27:57,139
Well, now I will tell you why.

438
00:27:58,046 --> 00:28:03,185
I'm here because this morning
someone dodged a very important question.

439
00:28:03,853 --> 00:28:05,042
Who?

440
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,939
Me. Linda asked who hired me.

441
00:28:10,307 --> 00:28:11,620
Who hired you?

442
00:28:11,814 --> 00:28:13,640
I do not know.

443
00:28:14,394 --> 00:28:17,152
An envelope of cash showed up
at my apartment yesterday,

444
00:28:17,152 --> 00:28:19,491
with the news,
clipping of Thrombey's death.

445
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:21,158
An envelope? That worked?

446
00:28:22,821 --> 00:28:24,613
An envelope of cash.

447
00:28:25,655 --> 00:28:28,276
So, somebody suspects foul play,

448
00:28:28,276 --> 00:28:32,870
and goes through this ha cha dance
of hiring me, of staying anonymous.

449
00:28:33,585 --> 00:28:36,336
It makes no damn sense.

450
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:39,587
Compels me though.

451
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,308
Walk me through everyone's
whereabouts at the time of death.

452
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:48,573
We know that the party
ended around 11:30.

453
00:28:49,016 --> 00:28:49,889
Goodnight, Joni.

454
00:28:49,889 --> 00:28:52,547
Marta took Harlan upstairs
to give him his meds.

455
00:28:54,512 --> 00:28:59,276
The stairs leading up to Harlan's bedroom
and his attic office creak horribly.

456
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,755
And Linda is a light sleeper.

457
00:29:01,755 --> 00:29:04,514
So we know every time someone
took the stairs that night.

458
00:29:07,628 --> 00:29:12,025
The first was when Joni heard a ka-thunk
from somewhere above her in the house.

459
00:29:21,282 --> 00:29:24,745
She's concerned about Harlan,
so she goes up to investigate,

460
00:29:26,065 --> 00:29:27,678
waking Linda.

461
00:29:28,228 --> 00:29:30,226
Harlan was in his attic office with Marta.

462
00:29:30,272 --> 00:29:32,162
- Hi, Joni.
- I just... Hi.

463
00:29:32,162 --> 00:29:34,108
He explained that they
had just knocked over the GO board.

464
00:29:34,108 --> 00:29:35,707
I just knocked over the GO board.

465
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:39,663
That game with the grid and stones,
they play it every night, and he was fine.

466
00:29:39,663 --> 00:29:41,871
- Go to bed.
- Go to bed, Joni.

467
00:29:41,976 --> 00:29:43,189
- Love you.
- Love you.

468
00:29:43,189 --> 00:29:44,565
So she did.

469
00:29:45,936 --> 00:29:49,340
Ten minutes later,
Linda is awoken a second time

470
00:29:51,312 --> 00:29:52,456
by Marta leaving.

471
00:29:52,456 --> 00:29:54,009
Walt, I'm leaving!

472
00:29:54,529 --> 00:29:56,963
Walt was smoking a cigar
on the porch with his son.

473
00:29:56,963 --> 00:29:59,210
He saw her leave and drive off.

474
00:30:00,277 --> 00:30:02,668
Noted the time - midnight.

475
00:30:09,363 --> 00:30:13,720
Fifteen minutes later, Linda is awoken
for the third and final time

476
00:30:15,993 --> 00:30:18,077
by someone coming down the stairs.

477
00:30:18,077 --> 00:30:20,455
Harlan, who came down
for a midnight snack.

478
00:30:20,604 --> 00:30:22,110
Dad, go to bed!

479
00:30:22,288 --> 00:30:24,385
Which Walt tried to discourage.

480
00:30:25,192 --> 00:30:31,197
Based on this, the medical examiner determined
the time of death to be between 12:15 and 2 AM.

481
00:30:31,197 --> 00:30:35,042
As Walt was finishing his cigar,
about 12:30, Meg came home.

482
00:30:35,189 --> 00:30:39,107
She went straight to bed. Walt and
Jacob turned in shortly after that.

483
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:46,226
Sometime later that night,
it's undetermined, but possibly near 3 AM,

484
00:30:46,647 --> 00:30:49,570
Meg woke up because the dogs
were barking outside.

485
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:52,354
She used the bathroom,
went back to bed.

486
00:30:52,808 --> 00:30:54,583
That's it, all right?

487
00:30:54,583 --> 00:30:58,285
Everyone's stories matched,
every moment accounted for.

488
00:30:59,367 --> 00:31:02,682
And there is no other staircase
up to Harlan's room?

489
00:31:02,696 --> 00:31:04,566
None. Just the creaky one.

490
00:31:04,566 --> 00:31:05,759
Interesting.

491
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:09,821
So, we know that Ransom didn't do it
because he wasn't there.

492
00:31:09,966 --> 00:31:13,533
Marta couldn't have.
Harlan was still alive when she left.

493
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:17,479
Meg? Meg came home during the window
of the time of death.

494
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:21,934
Except it was a suicide, all right?
Harlan slit right through his carotid.

495
00:31:21,934 --> 00:31:25,071
We saw from the blood splat patterns
that they were uninterrupted,

496
00:31:25,071 --> 00:31:28,769
meaning, It's almost impossible for anyone
to have been around him at the time.

497
00:31:30,051 --> 00:31:32,653
He's the one who cut his own throat, all right?
I don't know why we keep going over this.

498
00:31:32,653 --> 00:31:37,021
Physical evidence can tell
a clear story with a forked tongue.

499
00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:38,349
What?

500
00:31:38,349 --> 00:31:42,754
And as we can see from this morning.
Everyone can lie.

501
00:31:44,478 --> 00:31:47,420
Well. Almost everyone.

502
00:31:49,754 --> 00:31:51,268
Miss Cabrera.

503
00:31:52,311 --> 00:31:56,041
We kept you waiting all afternoon
because I wanted to hear from you last.

504
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:01,043
I needed an entire picture
of the evening in my head.

505
00:32:01,888 --> 00:32:05,533
Your piece of it
is at its very center.

506
00:32:06,776 --> 00:32:09,381
So please, take your time.

507
00:32:11,284 --> 00:32:17,702
You took Mr. Thrombey upstairs
at 11:30, and left at midnight.

508
00:32:18,337 --> 00:32:23,464
Think very carefully
and with as much detail as possible.

509
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:27,143
Tell us what happened
in that half hour.

510
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,504
- I got it.
- You got it?

511
00:32:34,944 --> 00:32:36,282
I got it.

512
00:32:36,934 --> 00:32:38,936
Okay, that's... Hey.

513
00:32:39,188 --> 00:32:41,440
Harlan. Let's...

514
00:32:42,674 --> 00:32:44,531
There are no second thoughts!

515
00:32:44,715 --> 00:32:46,236
No, no.

516
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,981
- Get up here!
- I had dose of champagne.

517
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:51,119
You only had one glass.

518
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:55,046
We are not breaking tradition
on my birthday!

519
00:32:55,046 --> 00:32:57,448
Can you just take your
goddamn medicine and go to bed?

520
00:32:57,448 --> 00:33:02,456
If you're gonna put that vile shit in me
you'll have to earn it. On my birthday.

521
00:33:02,456 --> 00:33:05,002
- 85th birthday.
- Fine, Jesus.

522
00:33:05,002 --> 00:33:06,702
I'm so old.

523
00:33:07,336 --> 00:33:09,016
You really love drama, huh?

524
00:33:10,306 --> 00:33:13,277
Okay, let's do this, 9 by 9.
You ready?

525
00:33:13,502 --> 00:33:15,067
- I'll whip your ass.
- Are you sure?

526
00:33:16,488 --> 00:33:18,044
How dare you?

527
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:22,138
I know how this is gonna end.

528
00:33:23,385 --> 00:33:24,768
What is that?

529
00:33:24,768 --> 00:33:26,589
Why can't I beat you at this game?

530
00:33:26,589 --> 00:33:29,662
Because I'm not playing to beat you,
I'm playing to built a beautiful pattern.

531
00:33:29,662 --> 00:33:32,843
That's elder abuse.
I'm gonna call the AARP.

532
00:33:32,843 --> 00:33:34,705
Don't make me get the belt,
I would, you know.

533
00:33:34,705 --> 00:33:36,486
It's basically over.

534
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:39,428
My only hope is
that an earthquake will strike.

535
00:33:40,407 --> 00:33:42,385
But what are the chances?

536
00:33:45,652 --> 00:33:47,378
Hello?

537
00:33:48,963 --> 00:33:50,636
Get under a door frame!

538
00:33:55,695 --> 00:33:58,935
Such a bad loser you are.
Meds, then bed.

539
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,665
I'm done with you.

540
00:34:01,288 --> 00:34:02,571
That's fair.

541
00:34:05,684 --> 00:34:10,539
Walt is smoking that filthy cigar
out there on the porch. Nasty things.

542
00:34:12,422 --> 00:34:13,756
How was tonight?

543
00:34:13,756 --> 00:34:16,039
Tonight was good.

544
00:34:16,761 --> 00:34:20,081
Oh, yeah? I know you weren't
looking forward to it.

545
00:34:20,081 --> 00:34:24,911
No. But I did it.
I cut the line on all four of them.

546
00:34:27,707 --> 00:34:32,415
It wasn't easy. This goddamn fortune.

547
00:34:34,443 --> 00:34:37,730
You know, sometimes I think that
everything I've given my family,

548
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:43,567
I've done maybe, without knowing,
or maybe, to keep them beneath me.

549
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:47,346
I certainly should have...
I don't know...

550
00:34:47,688 --> 00:34:51,258
encouraged Walt to write
his own stories,

551
00:34:51,258 --> 00:34:55,166
not just be a caretaker of mine.

552
00:34:55,377 --> 00:34:57,182
Like you said I should.

553
00:34:57,588 --> 00:35:02,639
And then be a father, not just a provider
for Joni, like you've also said.

554
00:35:02,962 --> 00:35:06,267
I could've been kinder
to Linda and Ransom.

555
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:09,307
Jesus, Ransom.

556
00:35:11,198 --> 00:35:14,671
There's so much of me in that kid.

557
00:35:15,732 --> 00:35:19,259
Confident, stupid, I dunno.

558
00:35:19,259 --> 00:35:25,271
Protected. Playing life like a game
without consequence,

559
00:35:27,399 --> 00:35:29,659
until you can't tell the difference

560
00:35:30,265 --> 00:35:34,554
between a stage prop
and a real knife.

561
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:38,053
I don't fear death.

562
00:35:38,575 --> 00:35:43,847
But, oh God, I'd like to fix
some of this before I go.

563
00:35:44,222 --> 00:35:46,386
Close the book with a flourish.

564
00:35:49,634 --> 00:35:51,258
I guess we'll see.

565
00:35:52,129 --> 00:35:53,660
I guess we will.

566
00:35:58,829 --> 00:35:59,882
Hey.

567
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:03,837
You had a long day.
You wanna do drugs.

568
00:36:04,465 --> 00:36:06,646
- You mean the good stuff?
- Yeah.

569
00:36:07,731 --> 00:36:11,347
Come on, send me to lala land.

570
00:36:11,347 --> 00:36:13,444
Just a tiny bit, okay?

571
00:36:13,896 --> 00:36:16,988
Why did I wait till my mid 80s
to become a morphine user.

572
00:36:16,988 --> 00:36:19,980
What a schmuck.
What a nud-nig.

573
00:36:21,449 --> 00:36:22,779
This stuff is the best.

574
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:30,097
Oh my god!

575
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:32,488
Is there a problem?

576
00:36:35,157 --> 00:36:37,840
This is what I just gave you
a 100 milligrams of.

577
00:36:39,219 --> 00:36:40,607
I messed up.

578
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:44,395
You gave me a 100 milligrams
of the good stuff?

579
00:36:46,681 --> 00:36:50,816
Excuse me, but what is the good stuff's
dosage supposed to be?

580
00:36:51,018 --> 00:36:54,039
Let's not call it that right now, okay?
Three milligrams.

581
00:36:54,196 --> 00:36:57,347
That's much less. So what happens?

582
00:36:58,024 --> 00:37:01,967
I'm gonna give you an emergency shot of
Naloxone, so that you don't die in ten minutes.

583
00:37:02,038 --> 00:37:03,377
Well, no pressure.

584
00:37:04,811 --> 00:37:07,578
You know, this is
an interesting and efficient

585
00:37:08,091 --> 00:37:10,653
method of murder.
I need to write this down.

586
00:37:11,026 --> 00:37:16,591
So, if someone switched the meds
on purpose, I'd be dead in ten minutes.

587
00:37:17,213 --> 00:37:18,873
Like stone cold dead?

588
00:37:18,873 --> 00:37:22,459
Yes, you'll feel symptoms in five.
Sweats, disorientation, and then...

589
00:37:23,571 --> 00:37:26,357
Yes, that big dose injected,
within ten your

590
00:37:27,052 --> 00:37:30,615
Your brain... Yes, ten minutes.

591
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:32,746
Yeah, from the moment of injection.

592
00:37:33,048 --> 00:37:34,447
It's eightish now.

593
00:37:34,447 --> 00:37:38,732
And even if the victim called for an
ambulance when he first felt symptoms,

594
00:37:38,732 --> 00:37:42,232
and if he lived in a great
big country house like we do.

595
00:37:42,232 --> 00:37:47,776
The ambulance would take at least
15 minutes to arrive, it'd be too late.

596
00:37:48,941 --> 00:37:52,570
If the victim didn't have
the emergency Naxostuff.

597
00:37:54,106 --> 00:37:57,555
Marta. Do you have the Naxostuff?

598
00:37:57,555 --> 00:37:59,489
Yes, I'm gonna find it.

599
00:37:59,794 --> 00:38:05,286
I have it because it comes with the kit, it
should be here, it has to be, it's like a...

600
00:38:15,118 --> 00:38:19,177
It's not here, Harlan.
I don't know, it's not here.

601
00:38:19,177 --> 00:38:21,106
So, I'm gonna use the phone, okay?

602
00:38:21,814 --> 00:38:23,566
To call an ambulance.

603
00:38:36,552 --> 00:38:37,986
What are you doing?

604
00:38:39,867 --> 00:38:41,478
What are you doing?

605
00:38:43,069 --> 00:38:45,036
Marta, listen to me.

606
00:38:45,172 --> 00:38:46,046
Harlan, I need to...

607
00:38:46,046 --> 00:38:49,484
Stop this! Stop this, Marta!
There is no time, you have to listen!

608
00:38:49,484 --> 00:38:50,982
I'm calling the family!

609
00:38:55,409 --> 00:38:57,687
What are you doing?
Are you nuts?

610
00:38:58,293 --> 00:39:00,540
Harlan, we have to call the ambulance,
we don't have time!

611
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,889
Listen to me!

612
00:39:03,015 --> 00:39:06,060
If what you said is true,
I'm gone, there's no saving me.

613
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,332
We have six minutes.

614
00:39:08,921 --> 00:39:12,576
We have got to get you out of this.
Think of your mom.

615
00:39:13,138 --> 00:39:14,416
My mom?

616
00:39:16,359 --> 00:39:18,733
Get behind, get behind.
Don't make a noise.

617
00:39:19,583 --> 00:39:20,582
Harlan?

618
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:23,786
Marta? Everything all right?

619
00:39:24,576 --> 00:39:26,651
- Hi, Joni.
- Hi.

620
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:28,908
I thought I heard something.
Is everything okay?

621
00:39:29,282 --> 00:39:30,655
We're fine.

622
00:39:31,567 --> 00:39:34,962
I just knocked over
the GO board, sorry about that.

623
00:39:35,154 --> 00:39:36,223
Everyone's all right?

624
00:39:36,223 --> 00:39:38,994
Yes, fine. Go to bed Joni.

625
00:39:38,994 --> 00:39:43,312
Okay. Maybe, we can talk tomorrow
about the thing with..

626
00:39:43,312 --> 00:39:44,844
Tomorrow is fine.

627
00:39:45,187 --> 00:39:46,382
- Love you.
- Love you.

628
00:39:46,382 --> 00:39:48,231
Night.

629
00:39:51,256 --> 00:39:52,728
Come on.

630
00:39:53,425 --> 00:39:55,074
Pay attention now.

631
00:39:55,575 --> 00:39:58,874
Your mom is still undocumented,

632
00:39:58,874 --> 00:40:00,542
and if this is your fault

633
00:40:00,694 --> 00:40:05,288
she'll be found out and, at best, deported,
and your family will be broken.

634
00:40:05,288 --> 00:40:07,667
But we're not gonna let
that happen, are we?

635
00:40:08,163 --> 00:40:10,732
But you have to do exactly
what I tell you.

636
00:40:11,232 --> 00:40:13,139
Will you do this Marta?

637
00:40:14,693 --> 00:40:19,244
This last thing.
For me. For your family.

638
00:40:22,748 --> 00:40:24,647
What do you want me to do?

639
00:40:25,884 --> 00:40:30,432
Go downstairs as noisily as you can,
and then say goodbye loudly.

640
00:40:30,432 --> 00:40:31,440
Walt! I'm leaving!

641
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,850
Call attention to the time.

642
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:34,089
God, it's midnight already.

643
00:40:34,089 --> 00:40:35,394
If you can.

644
00:40:36,852 --> 00:40:40,131
Drive out the gate, then to avoid
the security cameras,

645
00:40:40,131 --> 00:40:43,535
pull off the road
before the carved elephant.

646
00:40:44,783 --> 00:40:46,884
Wait, was it before or after?

647
00:40:46,884 --> 00:40:48,310
<i>After</i> the carved elephant.

648
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:50,397
No, he said before? Was it?

649
00:40:50,397 --> 00:40:52,055
<i>Beafterfore</i> the carved elephant.

650
00:40:52,055 --> 00:40:53,656
Oh, shit!

651
00:40:56,813 --> 00:41:00,212
Park and come back on foot
up to the house.

652
00:41:01,129 --> 00:41:04,050
Take the side yard path,
through that little gate.

653
00:41:04,945 --> 00:41:07,413
The dogs will know you,
they shouldn't bark.

654
00:41:08,698 --> 00:41:12,346
You've got to get up to the third floor
without being seen.

655
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:17,528
And the only way is to climb the side trellis
and come in through the trick hall window.

656
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:21,057
- You gotta be kidding me.
- I am not. Do it.

657
00:41:29,694 --> 00:41:32,486
And for God's sake
don't make any noise.

658
00:41:42,952 --> 00:41:45,628
Once you're inside.
Now, this is the tricky part.

659
00:41:45,922 --> 00:41:47,265
This is the tricky part?

660
00:41:47,535 --> 00:41:52,416
Get my robe and cap
from my bedroom, and put them on.

661
00:41:52,416 --> 00:41:55,397
Harlan, this is crazy.
I don't think I can do...

662
00:41:55,397 --> 00:41:57,005
We need to make this so airtight

663
00:41:57,005 --> 00:42:00,855
that the average cop
will entirely dismiss you as a suspect.

664
00:42:00,855 --> 00:42:03,086
It sounds crazy, but it will work.

665
00:42:07,666 --> 00:42:10,859
Walt is smoking outside,
and he'll see you

666
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:13,023
through the glazed window.

667
00:42:13,023 --> 00:42:15,440
Dad, go back to bed.

668
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:20,790
You were seen leaving,
the security cameras show you driving off.

669
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:25,350
And twenty minutes later
I am seen alive and well by my son.

670
00:42:25,738 --> 00:42:30,519
You see, you've gone from suspect
number one to an impossibility.

671
00:42:30,838 --> 00:42:36,096
Leave the way you came,
and don't be seen.

672
00:42:46,124 --> 00:42:47,843
Ransom?

673
00:42:48,865 --> 00:42:51,310
Are you back again already?

674
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,840
Drive home.

675
00:42:56,349 --> 00:43:00,530
And sometime, in the next few days
the police will question you.

676
00:43:00,534 --> 00:43:02,606
No, no, no.

677
00:43:03,201 --> 00:43:07,018
I can't lie, you know
I can't lie, I'll puke.

678
00:43:07,018 --> 00:43:08,260
Then don't lie.

679
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:11,624
Tell fragments of the truth.
In this exact order:

680
00:43:18,737 --> 00:43:23,892
I took him upstairs,
we played our nightly game of GO.

681
00:43:25,421 --> 00:43:31,105
At some point he knocked the board over
and Joni came up to check on us.

682
00:43:34,804 --> 00:43:39,502
I gave him pain medication,
he pulled his shoulder last week.

683
00:43:41,395 --> 00:43:45,557
And I left him
in his study at midnight.

684
00:43:45,812 --> 00:43:48,178
I said goodbye to Walt.

685
00:43:49,353 --> 00:43:50,358
Went home.

686
00:43:50,358 --> 00:43:52,513
What kind of medication
did you give him?

687
00:43:55,710 --> 00:44:00,600
Since his injury I've been giving him
a 100 milligram IV push of Toradol.

688
00:44:00,716 --> 00:44:02,738
It's a non narcotic analgesic.

689
00:44:03,148 --> 00:44:07,153
And to help him sleep,
3 milligrams of morphine.

690
00:44:07,541 --> 00:44:10,379
- And the family was aware of this?
- Yes, of course.

691
00:44:10,624 --> 00:44:14,651
Did you notice anything strange,
off about his demeanor?

692
00:44:18,504 --> 00:44:20,035
No.

693
00:44:24,136 --> 00:44:26,203
Sounds about right.

694
00:44:26,878 --> 00:44:28,830
Thank you, Miss Cabrera.

695
00:44:47,382 --> 00:44:50,796
Hey, sis, people are gonna start
getting here for the memorial pretty soon.

696
00:44:50,796 --> 00:44:52,589
Are you...?

697
00:44:54,812 --> 00:44:56,084
Are you all right?

698
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:59,155
I was just thinking
about Dad's games.

699
00:45:00,863 --> 00:45:05,907
This all feels like one,
like something he'd write, not do.

700
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,941
I keep waiting for the big reveal,

701
00:45:11,678 --> 00:45:16,422
where it all makes sense,
wouldn't that be nice?

702
00:45:17,117 --> 00:45:19,189
Walter.

703
00:45:21,341 --> 00:45:24,965
I don't think he killed himself.
I don't. I really don't.

704
00:45:25,563 --> 00:45:29,359
There's this Hallmark movie called
"Deadly By Surprise" with Danica McKellar.

705
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,351
And she plays the wife,
who's getting poisoned by her husband.

706
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,151
But he's doing it little by little,
so she doesn't know it.

707
00:45:36,306 --> 00:45:38,518
And she goes crazy
and she kills herself.

708
00:45:38,659 --> 00:45:41,999
And my cousin, who's a receptionist
at the medical examiners office.

709
00:45:42,127 --> 00:45:44,271
She says that stuff totally happens.

710
00:45:44,271 --> 00:45:47,883
Say, with 3% as crazy as this stuff
she's seen come through the...

711
00:45:50,232 --> 00:45:51,989
Oh, God. Yeah, I mean...

712
00:45:51,989 --> 00:45:53,969
You don't like him
because you love him.

713
00:45:54,104 --> 00:45:56,728
No, I don't like him,
he's an asshole.

714
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:59,616
But maybe, an asshole is what we needed.

715
00:46:00,107 --> 00:46:01,058
God, yeah...

716
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:04,733
An asshole is what Germany
needed in nineteen thirty... whatever.

717
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:06,808
Those 2 things don't even complete.

718
00:46:07,641 --> 00:46:12,116
Jesus, I'm gonna disappear
until the politics talk is done.

719
00:46:12,116 --> 00:46:13,863
You want some champers?

720
00:46:14,399 --> 00:46:16,292
I can't. I'm technically working.

721
00:46:16,804 --> 00:46:19,263
Take off your red cap, Richard
and look around you.

722
00:46:19,263 --> 00:46:21,413
The streets
are literally flooded with Nazis.

723
00:46:21,413 --> 00:46:22,596
No, no, no.

724
00:46:22,596 --> 00:46:26,066
We're losing our way of life
and our culture.

725
00:46:26,237 --> 00:46:28,531
There are millions of Mexicans coming.

726
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:31,507
And don't make this a race thing.
You always make this a race thing.

727
00:46:31,507 --> 00:46:35,171
I would say the same thing
if they were European immigrants.

728
00:46:35,171 --> 00:46:37,081
If the Swiss were like
clogging in the streets...

729
00:46:37,081 --> 00:46:39,963
We allow them in and
they think they own...

730
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:44,005
They're putting children in cages.
I mean, these are camps!

731
00:46:44,005 --> 00:46:46,911
Come on, Joni.
Nobody's saying that isn't bad,

732
00:46:46,911 --> 00:46:48,690
but the parents
have some blame here.

733
00:46:48,742 --> 00:46:51,103
For what? For wanting a better life
for their kids?

734
00:46:51,103 --> 00:46:52,221
Isn't that what America is...?

735
00:46:52,221 --> 00:46:54,531
For breaking the law.

736
00:46:54,961 --> 00:46:57,669
And you gonna hate hearing this,
but it's true.

737
00:46:57,669 --> 00:46:59,733
- America is for Americans.
- Don't point at me!

738
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:01,285
Where is Marta,
is she still here?

739
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:05,591
Marta. Come on over.
Marta, please. Come over.

740
00:47:06,368 --> 00:47:11,549
Marta, your family is from Uruguay,
but you did it right.

741
00:47:12,043 --> 00:47:15,895
What I'm saying is, they did it legally.
She did it the right way.

742
00:47:16,226 --> 00:47:20,189
You work hard, and you'll earn
your share from the ground up

743
00:47:20,189 --> 00:47:22,829
just like Dad
and like all the rest of us.

744
00:47:22,829 --> 00:47:24,405
And I bet
you agree with me, right?

745
00:47:24,405 --> 00:47:26,936
Just leave the poor girl
alone, Richard.

746
00:47:26,936 --> 00:47:29,590
It's okay, I just wanna
hear what she has to say.

747
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:30,543
It's okay, Marta, you can speak.

748
00:47:30,543 --> 00:47:32,553
Oh, sweetheart, don't feel
pressured to answer.

749
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:38,302
Look, if you wanna become an American,
there are legal ways to do it.

750
00:47:38,963 --> 00:47:42,615
But if you break the law,
it doesn't matter how good you heart is,

751
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:45,359
you gotta face the consequences.

752
00:47:45,703 --> 00:47:47,872
Are you, goddamn, insane?

753
00:47:47,872 --> 00:47:49,947
- Hey!
- I warn you!

754
00:47:55,773 --> 00:47:58,954
So I ask her, I'm like, Tonya,
what is wrong with people literally?

755
00:47:59,687 --> 00:48:01,591
Oh my God, Marta. What?

756
00:48:02,118 --> 00:48:04,293
Marta! What's the matter?

757
00:48:04,638 --> 00:48:08,275
Whoa, hey. Breathe.
Marta, are you okay?

758
00:48:09,896 --> 00:48:12,053
Hey, Fran, do you still have
your stash?

759
00:48:17,696 --> 00:48:19,176
Take 'em whenever you need 'em.

760
00:48:19,176 --> 00:48:21,324
They're just drying out
since you gave me that Juul.

761
00:48:21,643 --> 00:48:22,987
Thanks Fran.

762
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,092
Hey.

763
00:48:24,092 --> 00:48:27,021
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm very very sorry.

764
00:48:27,021 --> 00:48:29,613
Stop. Stop saying
you're sorry, Jesus.

765
00:48:29,974 --> 00:48:32,110
God, my heart won't stop, I can't...

766
00:48:33,795 --> 00:48:36,021
It's just everything.
No, thank you.

767
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,487
That's where Fran keeps her stash?

768
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:43,734
Who's gonna open a clock?

769
00:48:45,329 --> 00:48:50,246
Do you want dinner, Nana?
Dinner? To eat? To eat?

770
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:54,998
Walt, she's fine, she ate
the entire salmon spread already.

771
00:48:57,063 --> 00:48:59,707
Walt, did you tell Marta yet,
what we all talked about?

772
00:48:59,707 --> 00:49:01,479
No, not yet.
Is now a good time?

773
00:49:01,479 --> 00:49:03,662
Yes, yes a very good time.
Right now.

774
00:49:03,943 --> 00:49:07,803
Okay, all right.
Calm down. Calm down.

775
00:49:09,514 --> 00:49:13,555
Marta. We've been talking it over, and...

776
00:49:15,162 --> 00:49:17,188
Have you been smoking grass?

777
00:49:17,188 --> 00:49:19,506
No. Come on.

778
00:49:19,841 --> 00:49:22,171
Marta, we've been talking it over,

779
00:49:22,171 --> 00:49:26,189
the whole family,
we'd like to take care of you.

780
00:49:27,812 --> 00:49:29,059
What does that mean?

781
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:31,923
We all think
that you deserve something.

782
00:49:31,923 --> 00:49:34,480
Financially, we'd like to help you out.

783
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,692
You were never anything
but good to dad.

784
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:41,644
Because of that
you can count on us.

785
00:49:46,276 --> 00:49:50,763
I thought you should've been
at the funeral, by the way. I was outvoted.

786
00:50:01,786 --> 00:50:05,436
Detective, you're still here?

787
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,364
Did you know Harlan?

788
00:50:13,557 --> 00:50:16,971
He knew my father,
who was a police detective, years ago.

789
00:50:19,139 --> 00:50:23,309
My father respected Harlan.
That says quite a lot.

790
00:50:23,732 --> 00:50:25,204
Is that why you're here?

791
00:50:26,503 --> 00:50:29,036
Here, now here? No.

792
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:32,608
I stayed hoping to speak
to you a little more.

793
00:50:37,927 --> 00:50:41,039
Something is afoot
with this whole affair.

794
00:50:42,491 --> 00:50:45,858
I know it, and I believe
you know it too.

795
00:50:47,937 --> 00:50:49,716
So, you're gonna keep digging.

796
00:50:50,578 --> 00:50:57,069
Harlan's detectives, they dig,
they rifle and root, truffle pigs.

797
00:50:59,001 --> 00:51:02,888
I anticipate the terminus
of gravity's rainbow.

798
00:51:03,899 --> 00:51:05,650
Gravity's Rainbow?

799
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:08,319
- It's a novel.
- Yeah, I know.

800
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:11,193
- I haven't read it though.
- Neither have I.

801
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:13,753
Nobody has. But I like the title.

802
00:51:14,707 --> 00:51:18,970
It describes the path of a projectile,
determined by natural law.

803
00:51:19,297 --> 00:51:21,101
I Voilà, my method.

804
00:51:21,785 --> 00:51:25,304
I observe the facts,
without biases of the head or heart.

805
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:29,747
I determine the arc's path,
stroll leisurely to its terminus,

806
00:51:30,543 --> 00:51:32,889
and the truth falls at my feet.

807
00:51:35,898 --> 00:51:38,937
The medical examiner
was ready to rule this a suicide,

808
00:51:38,937 --> 00:51:42,278
but Elliott agreed
to keep it pending for 48 hours.

809
00:51:42,723 --> 00:51:46,774
Tomorrow morning I search the grounds
and the house, begin my investigation.

810
00:51:48,028 --> 00:51:50,261
I want you to be
by my side for it.

811
00:51:50,261 --> 00:51:50,848
What?

812
00:51:50,848 --> 00:51:52,730
My confidant, my eyes and ears.

813
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:54,665
Wait, detective. Why me?

814
00:51:54,665 --> 00:51:57,036
I trust your kind heart.

815
00:51:59,016 --> 00:52:02,265
Also, you're the only one who had
nothing to gain from Harlan's death.

816
00:52:03,375 --> 00:52:05,297
So, how about it, Watson?

817
00:52:05,893 --> 00:52:09,478
Detective, if you want my insight
into this family.

818
00:52:10,748 --> 00:52:14,056
None of them are murderers.
That's my insight.

819
00:52:14,327 --> 00:52:17,890
And yet. Be it cruel or comforting,

820
00:52:18,592 --> 00:52:22,028
this machine unerringly
arrives at the truth.

821
00:52:23,064 --> 00:52:24,608
That's what it does.

822
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:27,382
Always?

823
00:52:28,307 --> 00:52:30,070
Tomorrow at 8.

824
00:53:00,488 --> 00:53:03,580
I know I missed something,
there's gonna be something I missed.

825
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,616
- But I know you can beat it
- No, I can't...

826
00:53:05,616 --> 00:53:10,440
without losing your soul you have to do
what you have to do to beat this and win.

827
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,896
Harlan, I can't.

828
00:53:11,896 --> 00:53:14,026
You can and you have to.

829
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:17,863
For me. Right now!

830
00:53:37,644 --> 00:53:39,507
Harlan, I have to get you help.

831
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,779
You do as I say

832
00:53:43,416 --> 00:53:46,394
- and everything will be just fine.
- God, no.

833
00:53:47,986 --> 00:53:50,073
I promise.

834
00:53:50,073 --> 00:53:52,073
Please...

835
00:55:00,382 --> 00:55:03,026
Fifty years ago I worked at this estate.

836
00:55:03,396 --> 00:55:09,765
You know, security back then was such
that you had to make the rounds with a 94

837
00:55:10,087 --> 00:55:12,342
and keeping your ears open.

838
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:16,528
Now, you got all this
modern technology.

839
00:55:18,133 --> 00:55:22,282
That's the video there,
I saved the tape from that night.

840
00:55:22,455 --> 00:55:25,944
Normally, I erase 'em
with the magnetic de-gauser.

841
00:55:25,944 --> 00:55:28,995
But in this case I thought
I just save it, you know?

842
00:55:29,203 --> 00:55:33,452
For security. That's the live feed there.

843
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:39,730
To avoid the security cameras, pull
off the road <i>after</i> the carved elephant.

844
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:41,929
All right, well,
can we see the actual tape?

845
00:55:41,929 --> 00:55:43,694
Of course, you can.

846
00:55:43,902 --> 00:55:50,300
I recorded it SSLP.
There's 8 hours on that tape, 9 PM to 5 AM.

847
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:02,299
Looks like a Japanese horror movie.

848
00:56:02,299 --> 00:56:04,574
You think we can scan forward on that?

849
00:56:05,681 --> 00:56:07,111
How can we scan forward?

850
00:56:07,307 --> 00:56:13,001
Just hold the play button down
and press FF until you hear it grind.

851
00:56:19,189 --> 00:56:22,696
All right, should be coming up now
at the time when the party ended.

852
00:56:25,801 --> 00:56:26,782
What happened?

853
00:56:26,782 --> 00:56:29,856
You gotta keep holding it down
or else it'll eject.

854
00:56:29,925 --> 00:56:32,175
That thing eats tapes like popcorn.

855
00:56:32,175 --> 00:56:35,592
You think your guys can digitize it,
so we can scan it properly?

856
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:37,377
Yeah, I think we can do that.

857
00:56:37,945 --> 00:56:39,397
I got it.

858
00:56:41,658 --> 00:56:43,665
You know, all these statues
that you see around here,

859
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:48,121
they are all straight out of his series "The
Menagerie Tragedy" trilogy, pretty cool.

860
00:56:48,283 --> 00:56:50,118
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

861
00:56:50,671 --> 00:56:52,864
Benny. It's beautiful out here.

862
00:56:52,864 --> 00:56:55,589
But do you really think someone
broken into the house and murdered Harlan?

863
00:56:55,589 --> 00:56:56,897
Is that why we're out here?

864
00:56:56,897 --> 00:57:00,656
It is unlikely, but if they did,
there will be traces.

865
00:57:01,076 --> 00:57:02,990
- I can take on that.
- Yeah.

866
00:57:11,617 --> 00:57:14,289
Hey Wagner, you got any luck on...

867
00:57:15,919 --> 00:57:17,047
- What's his name?
- Ransom?

868
00:57:17,047 --> 00:57:17,926
Yeah.

869
00:57:18,089 --> 00:57:19,329
No.

870
00:57:20,401 --> 00:57:24,833
Did get an address though.
10 Kenoak street.

871
00:57:25,725 --> 00:57:29,045
Ten Kenoak. Kenoak.

872
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:32,482
It's a pleasant thing to say, isn't it?

873
00:57:32,854 --> 00:57:38,207
Kenoak. I awoke
amid Kenoak. That's funny.

874
00:57:38,207 --> 00:57:42,376
Always leaves and mud,
they really gonna do a number on my boots.

875
00:57:42,731 --> 00:57:45,307
Mud, has it rained the past week?

876
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:47,807
- No. Stay there!
- What?

877
00:57:48,739 --> 00:57:51,062
Okay. We got footprints here.

878
00:57:51,062 --> 00:57:53,273
So, I wanna...

879
00:57:53,819 --> 00:57:56,512
- Marta, stop.
- What?

880
00:57:57,244 --> 00:57:57,893
What?

881
00:57:57,893 --> 00:57:59,681
- Marta, stay there.
- What?

882
00:57:59,681 --> 00:58:02,276
No, Marta, stay there, Marta! No!

883
00:58:02,878 --> 00:58:04,100
Did you call me?

884
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:05,675
Excuse me.

885
00:58:05,675 --> 00:58:08,031
Wagner, we gonna need to call the boys,
so they come down here

886
00:58:08,031 --> 00:58:10,368
and take a look at
all these tracks, get it taped off.

887
00:58:10,368 --> 00:58:12,146
- Stay on that side.
- I'm sorry.

888
00:58:14,914 --> 00:58:16,314
Hey.

889
00:58:20,081 --> 00:58:24,532
Best judge of character is a dog.
I found that to be true.

890
00:58:33,739 --> 00:58:36,164
They've got plans
to read the will at around 10.

891
00:58:37,205 --> 00:58:39,047
The whole family will be here soon.

892
00:58:41,617 --> 00:58:43,406
I've never been to a will reading.

893
00:58:44,658 --> 00:58:46,654
You think it'll be like a game show.

894
00:58:47,276 --> 00:58:51,390
Think of a community theater
production of a tax return.

895
00:58:52,839 --> 00:58:54,701
So, what are we looking for?

896
00:58:54,701 --> 00:58:58,616
Oh, you know, anything suspicious
or out of the ordinary.

897
00:58:59,223 --> 00:59:00,898
You'll know it when you see it.

898
00:59:01,726 --> 00:59:03,189
Oh my God!

899
00:59:03,875 --> 00:59:05,704
Sweet beans!

900
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:13,207
Well, good morning, Mrs. Thrombey.

901
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:24,352
You think you could
handle the study?

902
00:59:34,029 --> 00:59:36,118
Where's your medical bag?

903
00:59:36,402 --> 00:59:40,353
I don't know. I left it here. I always
leave it here with Harlan at night.

904
00:59:40,353 --> 00:59:43,186
They must've taken it in
as evidence. I'll look into that.

905
00:59:49,022 --> 00:59:50,434
Shit.

906
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,295
How'd the GO board get knocked over?

907
00:59:55,482 --> 00:59:57,355
We were just goofing around.

908
00:59:58,962 --> 01:00:00,653
What are you thinking?

909
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:17,507
No, no, no.
Hey, hey, hey!

910
01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:19,628
Let me guess.

911
01:00:19,628 --> 01:00:21,622
Hey. Stop. Stop.

912
01:00:22,543 --> 01:00:23,721
Stop. Stop.

913
01:00:24,394 --> 01:00:25,929
Hugh Drysdale?

914
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:29,495
Ransom. Call me Ransom.
It's my middle name.

915
01:00:29,632 --> 01:00:31,235
Only the help call me Hugh.

916
01:00:32,151 --> 01:00:36,220
Okay, this is Trooper Wagner,
I'm Lieutenant Elliott.

917
01:00:36,899 --> 01:00:38,670
We just wanna ask
a few questions.

918
01:00:42,769 --> 01:00:45,288
Excuse me. Sir?

919
01:00:46,209 --> 01:00:47,848
We're officers of the law.

920
01:00:47,848 --> 01:00:50,934
You gonna run me in? I don't feel
like talking. I'm distraught.

921
01:00:51,487 --> 01:00:53,769
Hey Benny, you wanna ask
this guy some questions?

922
01:00:53,769 --> 01:00:55,320
All right, what is this?
What's this arrangement?

923
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,783
Mr. Drysdale.

924
01:00:57,093 --> 01:00:59,255
CSI KFC?

925
01:01:04,145 --> 01:01:06,704
Hey Frannie, how about a glass
of cold milk?

926
01:01:07,052 --> 01:01:10,229
Hey asshole.
Not her name, Not her job.

927
01:01:10,554 --> 01:01:13,162
Hey Meg. How's your
SJW degree coming?

928
01:01:13,631 --> 01:01:16,137
- Trust fund prick.
- All right. Guys.

929
01:01:18,352 --> 01:01:19,860
Hey, everyone.

930
01:01:20,192 --> 01:01:24,491
I'm just gonna be in the other room,
setting up, be ready in 10 minutes.

931
01:01:30,238 --> 01:01:34,183
Funny, Ransom, you skipped the funeral,
but you're early for the will reading.

932
01:01:35,889 --> 01:01:38,929
Okay, people grieve
in different ways, let's not...

933
01:01:38,929 --> 01:01:40,571
You know what?
It's funny you're here at all.

934
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:43,428
Why are you even bothering?
That's what I'm asking myself.

935
01:01:43,829 --> 01:01:45,196
What's that supposed to mean?

936
01:01:45,196 --> 01:01:48,231
- He knows what it supposed to mean.
- Wait. Walt. What?

937
01:01:50,810 --> 01:01:54,071
Jacob was in that bathroom
in the night of the party.

938
01:01:55,554 --> 01:01:57,511
Oh, that's where
you were all night?

939
01:01:57,511 --> 01:01:59,944
The hell were you doing in the
bathroom all night?

940
01:01:59,944 --> 01:02:01,985
- Nothing.
- Swatting Syrian refugees?

941
01:02:01,985 --> 01:02:03,918
- No. I was not.
- Alt right troll.

942
01:02:03,918 --> 01:02:05,206
Liberal snowflake.

943
01:02:05,206 --> 01:02:06,847
I don't know
what any of that means.

944
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:08,666
It means your son's
a little creep.

945
01:02:08,666 --> 01:02:11,314
Oh, my son's a creep?

946
01:02:11,314 --> 01:02:12,915
Guys! Just...

947
01:02:12,915 --> 01:02:14,588
Walt, he was in the bathroom.

948
01:02:14,588 --> 01:02:15,930
Yeah, he was in the bathroom,

949
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:18,930
joylessly masturbating
to pictures of dead deer.

950
01:02:20,014 --> 01:02:22,230
You know what, Richard?
You wanna go?

951
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:23,928
You bet, Skippy. Let's go!

952
01:02:24,078 --> 01:02:25,348
You wanna go? C'mon!

953
01:02:25,519 --> 01:02:26,815
You better watch out!

954
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:28,080
Stop!

955
01:02:29,617 --> 01:02:32,145
C'mon, you had me
waiting for it my whole life!

956
01:02:32,145 --> 01:02:33,848
Stop it right now!

957
01:02:33,848 --> 01:02:36,059
I can handle myself!
I can handle it.

958
01:02:36,059 --> 01:02:37,549
Oh my God!

959
01:02:37,742 --> 01:02:39,581
We gotta do this more often.

960
01:02:39,581 --> 01:02:41,141
Hey!

961
01:02:41,308 --> 01:02:43,940
Jacob, we know
where this is going.

962
01:02:44,233 --> 01:02:46,298
You were in the bathroom
next to Harlan's office,

963
01:02:46,298 --> 01:02:47,997
where he had the fight
with Ransom.

964
01:02:48,152 --> 01:02:50,525
Now, you heard something. Spill it.

965
01:02:52,795 --> 01:02:54,543
I just heard two things.

966
01:02:58,205 --> 01:02:59,489
...my will!

967
01:02:59,658 --> 01:03:01,246
My will.

968
01:03:01,433 --> 01:03:03,847
And then there was more yelling,

969
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:09,619
and then I heard
Ransom say "I'm warning you."

970
01:03:13,519 --> 01:03:16,271
Ransom? What's that mean?

971
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:19,129
I think that means our father
finally came to his senses

972
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:22,051
and cut this worthless little brat
out of his will.

973
01:03:22,842 --> 01:03:25,144
So, I guess you gonna have to
sell the Beamer,

974
01:03:25,144 --> 01:03:27,087
and give your notice
at the country club,

975
01:03:27,087 --> 01:03:29,531
and kick whatever fashion drugs
you're on.

976
01:03:29,697 --> 01:03:32,999
Because if you think that after
all the bridges you burned,

977
01:03:32,999 --> 01:03:35,788
After all the shit you said,
after everything that you put

978
01:03:35,788 --> 01:03:37,906
this family through
for the last 10 years,

979
01:03:37,906 --> 01:03:40,562
that any of us
are gonna support you,

980
01:03:40,562 --> 01:03:42,516
that any of us
are gonna give you,

981
01:03:42,516 --> 01:03:48,629
like dad liked to say,
a single red dime, you're nuts!

982
01:03:52,432 --> 01:03:53,662
Son.

983
01:03:54,673 --> 01:03:55,846
Father?

984
01:03:56,634 --> 01:03:59,980
Did Harlan tell you he was
gonna cut you out of the will?

985
01:04:01,869 --> 01:04:03,179
Yup.

986
01:04:06,107 --> 01:04:10,753
Well, then he's done what
none of us were strong enough to do.

987
01:04:12,149 --> 01:04:14,713
Maybe this might finally
make you grow up.

988
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:20,450
This might be the best thing
that could ever happen to you.

989
01:04:20,663 --> 01:04:22,988
Thank you. My mother,
ladies and gentlemen.

990
01:04:23,171 --> 01:04:26,926
Look, this is not gonna be easy
for you, but it'll be good.

991
01:04:27,505 --> 01:04:29,475
Nothing good is ever easy.

992
01:04:29,817 --> 01:04:30,935
Up your ass, Joni.

993
01:04:30,935 --> 01:04:33,321
You've got your teeth in this family's
tit for a long time.

994
01:04:33,321 --> 01:04:35,394
Up your ass? Very nice.

995
01:04:35,394 --> 01:04:38,287
Matter of fact -
eat shit, hows that?

996
01:04:39,099 --> 01:04:42,400
In fact, eat shit,
eat shit, eat shit.

997
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:45,238
- You entitled prick!
- I would snap that smug smile...

998
01:04:45,238 --> 01:04:47,762
Definitely eat shit. Eat shit.

999
01:04:52,321 --> 01:04:53,776
I own it, shit!

1000
01:04:55,362 --> 01:04:57,918
What was that about
will readings being boring?

1001
01:04:58,732 --> 01:05:00,921
Exception that proves the rule.

1002
01:05:03,444 --> 01:05:04,942
Asshole.

1003
01:05:05,709 --> 01:05:10,079
I'm warning you.
Ransom said "I'm warning you."

1004
01:05:10,425 --> 01:05:13,160
You heard Ransom in there,
that's the kind of thing he says.

1005
01:05:13,956 --> 01:05:15,762
You want this? You want this?

1006
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:22,549
What do we have here?

1007
01:05:27,982 --> 01:05:31,390
This looks like
a relatively fresh break.

1008
01:05:31,669 --> 01:05:33,544
Yup. Right there.

1009
01:05:34,185 --> 01:05:35,197
Wait a minute.

1010
01:05:35,503 --> 01:05:39,652
That doesn't make sense.
Where's that window?

1011
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:44,027
How about some more cookies, you?
You want some more cookies?

1012
01:05:45,555 --> 01:05:49,750
Hey, maybe Harlem left you
a cold glass of milk in his will, asshole!

1013
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:54,074
Show me, but stay off the carpet.

1014
01:06:09,027 --> 01:06:12,616
It's the trick window!
From "A Kill For All Seasons!"

1015
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:14,542
Trooper, here, will you take this?

1016
01:06:26,933 --> 01:06:29,350
Traces of dried mud.

1017
01:06:29,874 --> 01:06:32,705
I suspect they go
the length of the hallway.

1018
01:06:33,868 --> 01:06:35,062
Footprints?

1019
01:06:35,062 --> 01:06:36,908
No, just traces.

1020
01:06:37,087 --> 01:06:39,709
Depending on when this thing
was last cleaned,

1021
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:42,831
this could've happened
at anytime, right?

1022
01:06:42,874 --> 01:06:46,039
No, that would not explain this.

1023
01:06:46,779 --> 01:06:49,941
Analyze that mud.
It will match these traces.

1024
01:06:50,486 --> 01:06:54,674
And you will find similar samples, leading
up the trellis on the outside of the house.

1025
01:06:55,528 --> 01:06:59,584
On the night of the party, somebody who did
not want to be heard climbing those steps

1026
01:06:59,743 --> 01:07:03,700
went to a great deal of trouble
to break into Harlan Thrombey's rooms.

1027
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:07,271
The game is afoot, eh Watson?

1028
01:07:18,114 --> 01:07:21,006
Well. Thank you all for
getting together like this,

1029
01:07:21,006 --> 01:07:24,578
it isn't legally necessary,
but I thought because you're all in town

1030
01:07:24,578 --> 01:07:26,247
and some of you are leaving soon...

1031
01:07:26,247 --> 01:07:29,002
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

1032
01:07:29,969 --> 01:07:35,023
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to
gently request that you all stay in town

1033
01:07:35,182 --> 01:07:37,101
until the investigation is completed.

1034
01:07:37,101 --> 01:07:40,551
He's gently requesting,
but we gotta make that an order.

1035
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:42,466
No one move
until we figure this all out.

1036
01:07:42,897 --> 01:07:44,828
- What?
- Can we ask why?

1037
01:07:44,828 --> 01:07:46,266
- Has something changed?
- No.

1038
01:07:46,266 --> 01:07:48,369
No it hasn't changed
or no we can't ask?

1039
01:07:48,369 --> 01:07:51,400
Mr. Stevens, you may continue.

1040
01:07:51,827 --> 01:07:57,242
Right. Well the other reason I thought
this gathering would be beneficial

1041
01:07:57,414 --> 01:08:02,822
is because Harlan altered
his will a week before he died.

1042
01:08:02,822 --> 01:08:08,536
He sealed, he asked me not to submit it to the
courts for probate until after his death.

1043
01:08:09,084 --> 01:08:13,230
If anyone is confused about anything,
we're all together, we can talk.

1044
01:08:13,722 --> 01:08:17,363
Although, I don't imagine any of it
is going to be that complicated.

1045
01:08:17,968 --> 01:08:19,823
Harlan's assets included

1046
01:08:20,846 --> 01:08:22,299
- The house.
- The house,

1047
01:08:22,299 --> 01:08:23,843
which he owned outright.

1048
01:08:25,091 --> 01:08:26,660
- Sixty million.
- Yes.

1049
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:30,313
Sixty million in various
cash accounts and investments.

1050
01:08:30,477 --> 01:08:33,836
And, of course, the real asset -

1051
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,000
sole ownership of Blood Like Wine,
his publishing company.

1052
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:43,298
He also wrote up a statement when he was making
the changes and he wanted that read first.

1053
01:08:45,986 --> 01:08:48,577
"Dearest Linda, Walter, and Joni."

1054
01:08:48,769 --> 01:08:51,548
Some of you may be surprised
by the choice I've made here.

1055
01:08:51,548 --> 01:08:54,133
No pleasure was taken
in the exclusion,

1056
01:08:54,133 --> 01:08:58,860
and its purpose was not to sow greater
discord in the family, quite the opposite.

1057
01:08:59,319 --> 01:09:03,110
Please accept it with grace
and without bitterness. But do accept it.

1058
01:09:03,423 --> 01:09:05,703
"It's for the best, Dad."

1059
01:09:19,225 --> 01:09:21,811
Wow, well, yeah.
Not too complex at all.

1060
01:09:22,871 --> 01:09:24,079
This'll be quick.

1061
01:09:25,053 --> 01:09:30,234
I, Harlan Thrombey, being of sound mind
and body, yada yada...

1062
01:09:31,474 --> 01:09:35,535
I hereby direct that all my assets,
both liquid and otherwise,

1063
01:09:35,693 --> 01:09:39,461
I leave in their entirety
to Marta Cabrera.

1064
01:09:40,956 --> 01:09:43,691
My entire ownership
of Blood Like Wine publishing

1065
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:46,688
I leave in its entirety to Marta Cabrera.

1066
01:09:46,861 --> 01:09:51,881
"The copyright of its catalog likewise
I leave in its entirety to Marta Cabrera."

1067
01:09:55,971 --> 01:09:57,258
What?

1068
01:10:02,007 --> 01:10:04,755
No. That's not...

1069
01:10:04,936 --> 01:10:06,124
No.

1070
01:10:06,124 --> 01:10:08,371
That can't be.
Can I see that please, Alan?

1071
01:10:08,371 --> 01:10:09,670
- That's right.
- Please.

1072
01:10:09,670 --> 01:10:10,816
This can't be legal.

1073
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:12,699
It's right.

1074
01:10:12,768 --> 01:10:14,230
- You know, he's been...
- Oh my God!

1075
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:16,503
Alan, it's a mistake.

1076
01:10:16,503 --> 01:10:18,755
I don't know what to say,
we're his family, so...

1077
01:10:19,307 --> 01:10:20,802
It's not possible!

1078
01:10:20,862 --> 01:10:22,844
Are there safeguards against this?

1079
01:10:26,035 --> 01:10:26,990
Harlan was...

1080
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:29,819
In his final days
he was under weight of medication.

1081
01:10:29,969 --> 01:10:32,027
Obviously, he wasn't...
I mean... I don't know...

1082
01:10:33,015 --> 01:10:38,959
Alan, you can take this piece of paper
and shove it right up your ass and get out.

1083
01:10:39,132 --> 01:10:41,185
And you cops too.
Out! Out!

1084
01:10:41,476 --> 01:10:42,593
- Right now!
- Melinda.

1085
01:10:42,593 --> 01:10:46,296
No, Richard, we need to talk,
we need to fight this thing.

1086
01:10:46,296 --> 01:10:48,893
We're not going anywhere.
I said get out!

1087
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:54,258
We're the Thrombeys goddammit!
This is still our house!

1088
01:11:01,841 --> 01:11:02,769
Sorry.

1089
01:11:03,066 --> 01:11:05,714
"Likewise the house at 2 Deerborn Drive

1090
01:11:05,714 --> 01:11:08,866
and all belongings therein
I leave to Marta Cabrera."

1091
01:11:11,149 --> 01:11:13,394
You little bitch!

1092
01:11:13,562 --> 01:11:16,164
You little bitch!

1093
01:11:16,297 --> 01:11:19,326
Did you know about this?
Were you in this from the beginning?

1094
01:11:19,326 --> 01:11:20,730
No, no, no!
I just wanna know!

1095
01:11:21,147 --> 01:11:23,780
What were you doing?
Were you boinking my father?

1096
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:24,719
"Boinking?"

1097
01:11:25,610 --> 01:11:27,556
I think everybody just needs to cool...

1098
01:11:27,556 --> 01:11:30,537
You had sex with my grandpa.
You dirty anchor baby.

1099
01:11:31,183 --> 01:11:33,524
In the meantime I'd maybe run.

1100
01:11:34,354 --> 01:11:35,383
Marta.

1101
01:11:35,749 --> 01:11:37,267
- Ladies and gentlemen.
- Talk to us.

1102
01:11:37,872 --> 01:11:40,221
Marta, wait a minute.

1103
01:11:40,370 --> 01:11:42,324
I totally understand
how you must be feeling.

1104
01:11:42,324 --> 01:11:43,191
You can talk to me.

1105
01:11:43,191 --> 01:11:44,641
I don't know how this...

1106
01:11:45,404 --> 01:11:46,789
I don't know.

1107
01:11:50,429 --> 01:11:53,470
I don't know what's happening.
I don't know why he...

1108
01:11:53,579 --> 01:11:56,405
Guys, I'm also confused,
I need to think.

1109
01:11:56,405 --> 01:11:58,154
Marta! You listen...

1110
01:11:58,584 --> 01:11:59,838
I can't catch up!

1111
01:12:04,733 --> 01:12:06,538
I can't open the damn...

1112
01:12:08,568 --> 01:12:12,080
Marta, you have to understand.
He is our father.

1113
01:12:12,547 --> 01:12:15,129
Marta, don't listen to them. I'm here.

1114
01:12:15,308 --> 01:12:17,084
I'm not on Twitter anymore.

1115
01:12:18,010 --> 01:12:21,586
So, de-add me on Instagram, okay?
I wanna talk to you.

1116
01:12:28,547 --> 01:12:29,615
What's going on?

1117
01:12:29,615 --> 01:12:32,320
I think this could be the best thing
to happen to all of you!

1118
01:12:34,489 --> 01:12:36,149
What does he mean by that?

1119
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:39,387
Richard, why didn't you stop he?

1120
01:12:39,456 --> 01:12:42,317
What was I supposed to do?
Grab the bumper with my teeth?

1121
01:12:52,594 --> 01:12:54,561
Okay, seriously though, what the hell?

1122
01:12:59,688 --> 01:13:01,398
Hey, can we take an extra bowl?

1123
01:13:01,398 --> 01:13:02,786
Sure.

1124
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:12,405
You look like you're gonna pass out.
Have you eaten anything today?

1125
01:13:12,405 --> 01:13:13,706
Eat.

1126
01:13:17,711 --> 01:13:19,028
This is a nightmare.

1127
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:22,729
So why?

1128
01:13:24,068 --> 01:13:26,016
- Why?
- Why?

1129
01:13:27,281 --> 01:13:30,317
Hey, this is everything.

1130
01:13:31,439 --> 01:13:33,400
There gotta be a bigger reason why
and you know it.

1131
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:35,967
Well, how about it had to do more
with you guys than with me.

1132
01:13:38,065 --> 01:13:39,400
Yeah.

1133
01:13:40,151 --> 01:13:42,091
Yeah, it's the only thing
that makes sense.

1134
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:49,018
Did he tell you anything?

1135
01:13:49,018 --> 01:13:50,754
Only that I wasn't getting a cent.

1136
01:13:50,754 --> 01:13:52,852
That's because he wanted you to build
something from the ground...

1137
01:13:52,852 --> 01:13:54,527
"Build something
from the ground up", yeah.

1138
01:13:54,527 --> 01:13:56,161
My mother built her business
from the ground up

1139
01:13:56,161 --> 01:13:58,739
with a million dollar loan
from my grandfather.

1140
01:13:58,885 --> 01:14:01,823
My father owns none of it,
she made him sign a prenup.

1141
01:14:01,867 --> 01:14:03,115
He lives in fear.

1142
01:14:03,621 --> 01:14:06,776
And I know that's what grandfather was
trying to protect me from by doing this,

1143
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:10,423
And I know I shouldn't say this
out loud, but when he told me, I...

1144
01:14:12,172 --> 01:14:14,805
Jesus, I coulda killed him.

1145
01:14:17,398 --> 01:14:20,027
After I left the party, though,
I was driving

1146
01:14:20,572 --> 01:14:23,798
nowhere, just in the night,
and I had this...

1147
01:14:26,004 --> 01:14:27,461
clarity.

1148
01:14:27,945 --> 01:14:31,060
Like from here on out
I was gonna have to fend for myself.

1149
01:14:31,861 --> 01:14:33,481
And that felt...

1150
01:14:34,541 --> 01:14:35,838
Good.

1151
01:14:37,070 --> 01:14:38,708
The old bastard.

1152
01:14:41,708 --> 01:14:47,518
Marta I know three things.
One: I know he didn't commit suicide.

1153
01:14:49,648 --> 01:14:50,622
What makes you think that?

1154
01:14:50,622 --> 01:14:53,132
I don't think it. I know it.

1155
01:14:53,806 --> 01:14:55,433
Because I knew my granddad.

1156
01:14:55,433 --> 01:14:57,300
Maybe you and I
are the only two who knew him,

1157
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:59,969
so you're not gonna bullshit
me on this, because two:

1158
01:15:00,968 --> 01:15:02,918
I know lying makes you puke.

1159
01:15:03,403 --> 01:15:05,952
'Cause of that mafia game
last 4th of July.

1160
01:15:07,295 --> 01:15:08,753
And three:

1161
01:15:10,376 --> 01:15:13,533
I know that you just ate a full plate
of baked beans and sausage.

1162
01:15:16,184 --> 01:15:17,615
So.

1163
01:15:19,244 --> 01:15:21,255
Look me in the eye

1164
01:15:21,937 --> 01:15:24,576
and tell me what
happened to my grandfather.

1165
01:15:27,506 --> 01:15:29,412
- You asshole.
- Marta.

1166
01:15:30,418 --> 01:15:32,762
Tell me everything.

1167
01:15:35,910 --> 01:15:37,790
Alan, there have got
to be options here.

1168
01:15:37,790 --> 01:15:40,232
No. I don't know how many times

1169
01:15:40,232 --> 01:15:43,524
I can repeat the same
two pieces of information.

1170
01:15:43,524 --> 01:15:46,918
If Harlan was of sound mind
when he made the changes,

1171
01:15:46,918 --> 01:15:48,512
and we've all confirmed he was.

1172
01:15:48,512 --> 01:15:51,220
Would a sound mind
do this! How? Sound how?

1173
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:53,683
The very action
speaks to unsoundness!

1174
01:15:53,815 --> 01:15:55,244
Not legally, no.

1175
01:15:55,882 --> 01:15:59,715
You, not liking what he did
does not speak to testamentary capacity.

1176
01:15:59,715 --> 01:16:02,414
What about undue influence?

1177
01:16:02,414 --> 01:16:04,789
Yes! Undue influence!
How about that?

1178
01:16:05,308 --> 01:16:06,277
Did you just Google that?

1179
01:16:06,277 --> 01:16:09,311
Look, if Marta was manipulating
dad somehow, and if...

1180
01:16:09,311 --> 01:16:11,798
If somehow she had gotten
her hooks into him.

1181
01:16:11,798 --> 01:16:14,196
You need a strong case for that.

1182
01:16:14,639 --> 01:16:17,070
Your honor, "She endeared herself to him"

1183
01:16:17,070 --> 01:16:19,319
through hard work and good humor."

1184
01:16:19,485 --> 01:16:21,584
That won't cut the salami.

1185
01:16:21,724 --> 01:16:23,367
What about the slayer rule?

1186
01:16:24,153 --> 01:16:25,498
I did just Google that.

1187
01:16:25,869 --> 01:16:27,788
The slayer rule obviously
doesn't apply here.

1188
01:16:28,992 --> 01:16:30,563
What the hell is the slayer rule?

1189
01:16:30,563 --> 01:16:34,701
It's if someone is convicted of killing the
person, they don't get their inheritance.

1190
01:16:34,701 --> 01:16:38,616
Not even convicted, even if they're held
responsible for their death in civil court.

1191
01:16:39,118 --> 01:16:40,592
Like OJ.

1192
01:16:40,907 --> 01:16:46,520
Yes, Like OJ.
But Harlan committed suicide.

1193
01:16:55,103 --> 01:16:56,830
Detective Blank.

1194
01:16:56,830 --> 01:17:00,053
You said that the investigation is ongoing,
you made a point of that.

1195
01:17:00,351 --> 01:17:01,829
Do you suspect foul play?

1196
01:17:01,829 --> 01:17:04,956
Mister Blanc. If you please.

1197
01:17:06,329 --> 01:17:12,886
There is much that remains unclear.
But yes. I suspect foul play.

1198
01:17:14,571 --> 01:17:15,665
Marta?

1199
01:17:15,863 --> 01:17:18,339
I have eliminated no suspects.

1200
01:17:20,417 --> 01:17:23,705
You're full of shit, I don't trust
this guy in the tweed suit,

1201
01:17:24,008 --> 01:17:26,394
and Alan, God bless you,
you're useless.

1202
01:17:26,935 --> 01:17:28,064
Thank you.

1203
01:17:28,064 --> 01:17:31,195
There's only one answer to this:
she has to renounce the inheritance.

1204
01:17:31,195 --> 01:17:32,171
She knows that's what
she should do...

1205
01:17:32,171 --> 01:17:34,194
That's exactly what she'll do.

1206
01:17:36,424 --> 01:17:37,801
- Mom.
- She'll do it.

1207
01:17:38,173 --> 01:17:41,057
If Granddad wanted to give Marta
everything, then that's what he wanted.

1208
01:17:41,057 --> 01:17:44,510
No, this wasn't him.
He loved us.

1209
01:17:44,654 --> 01:17:48,269
He wanted us taken care of.
He wanted you to have an education.

1210
01:17:48,749 --> 01:17:52,385
Meg, you think I can pay
for your school?

1211
01:18:03,130 --> 01:18:06,647
I know, just saying it it
sounds insane, but it's all true.

1212
01:18:06,782 --> 01:18:09,287
And I think Blanc's been on to me
from the start.

1213
01:18:09,447 --> 01:18:11,853
I don't care if I go to jail,
but my mom...

1214
01:18:12,391 --> 01:18:14,949
My sister, we...

1215
01:18:17,513 --> 01:18:19,342
Are you gonna say something?

1216
01:18:20,587 --> 01:18:23,740
I always thought I was the only one
that could beat him at GO.

1217
01:18:24,630 --> 01:18:26,631
I always thought
that meant something.

1218
01:18:26,981 --> 01:18:28,943
Yeah, I know you did.

1219
01:18:28,943 --> 01:18:33,483
In the night of the party, my last
conversation with him, our last argument.

1220
01:18:33,483 --> 01:18:35,359
That's what he told me about you.

1221
01:18:36,405 --> 01:18:38,910
That you beat him in GO
more than I do, and I thought...

1222
01:18:41,404 --> 01:18:43,585
What a strange thing to tell me.

1223
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:47,337
I think I get it now.

1224
01:18:49,461 --> 01:18:51,505
It did mean something.

1225
01:18:56,946 --> 01:18:58,788
I'm not gonna tell my family shit.

1226
01:18:58,936 --> 01:19:01,967
You're not going to jail.
That detective is not gonna catch you.

1227
01:19:03,073 --> 01:19:05,194
And you're not gonna
give up the money.

1228
01:19:05,434 --> 01:19:08,593
This is was granddad wanted for you and me, think
about what he did to go through with this.

1229
01:19:08,593 --> 01:19:11,259
He wanted this for himself,
he wanted this for the family.

1230
01:19:12,266 --> 01:19:13,970
And he wanted it for you.

1231
01:19:13,970 --> 01:19:18,211
You've come this far.
Let me help you go all the way.

1232
01:19:18,379 --> 01:19:20,159
What's going on? This isn't you.

1233
01:19:20,713 --> 01:19:25,066
You could just turn me in right now and
still get your cut of the inheritance. Why?

1234
01:19:25,615 --> 01:19:27,555
Because fuck my family.

1235
01:19:28,915 --> 01:19:31,742
I can help you get away
with this, and then...

1236
01:19:32,722 --> 01:19:35,237
You're gonna give me
my cut of the inheritance.

1237
01:19:36,711 --> 01:19:40,737
Happy ending. Everybody wins:
you, me, Harlan.

1238
01:19:40,737 --> 01:19:42,393
Yeah.

1239
01:19:43,118 --> 01:19:45,314
Deal?

1240
01:19:56,730 --> 01:19:58,224
- Meg.
- Marta.

1241
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:01,923
- That was nuts.
- I know.

1242
01:20:02,311 --> 01:20:03,538
Are you okay?

1243
01:20:05,035 --> 01:20:07,141
Yeah. Are you?

1244
01:20:07,141 --> 01:20:08,545
Yeah, I'm fine.

1245
01:20:10,184 --> 01:20:12,227
Look, no one knows
I'm calling you, I just...

1246
01:20:12,424 --> 01:20:13,868
I wanted to...

1247
01:20:16,388 --> 01:20:19,134
I wanted to say sorry
for how everyone was.

1248
01:20:20,444 --> 01:20:25,944
And... I guess I wanted to ask...
What are you gonna do?

1249
01:20:28,846 --> 01:20:30,368
What do you mean?

1250
01:20:30,368 --> 01:20:33,934
Well, the... with the will.
What are you gonna to do?

1251
01:20:36,621 --> 01:20:38,526
What do you think I should do?

1252
01:20:39,095 --> 01:20:43,710
You should do
whatever you think is right.

1253
01:20:46,372 --> 01:20:48,127
Look, I...

1254
01:20:49,744 --> 01:20:52,114
I think you should
give it back to us.

1255
01:20:53,909 --> 01:20:57,150
Granddad always took
care of us, we're his family.

1256
01:20:57,935 --> 01:21:01,538
I know he was like family to you,
but we're his actual family.

1257
01:21:01,684 --> 01:21:02,769
Yeah.

1258
01:21:03,778 --> 01:21:08,581
Marta, you know this isn't fair,
we've always been good to you,

1259
01:21:08,581 --> 01:21:11,435
and you're like family
and we'll take care of you, but...

1260
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:15,934
You have to make things right.
You know what's right.

1261
01:21:16,787 --> 01:21:18,140
Marta.

1262
01:21:20,674 --> 01:21:24,668
Mom's broke, she says
I'm gonna have to drop out of school.

1263
01:21:24,668 --> 01:21:26,353
No, no, Meg.

1264
01:21:27,961 --> 01:21:29,750
Listen, I won't let that happen.

1265
01:21:29,922 --> 01:21:33,352
Whatever money you need,
I'll give it to you. I'm here for you.

1266
01:21:33,352 --> 01:21:35,177
And I want you to know
I'm gonna take care of you.

1267
01:21:35,177 --> 01:21:38,835
- I promise that, okay?
- Thanks.

1268
01:21:39,387 --> 01:21:40,948
And once I...

1269
01:21:59,965 --> 01:22:01,512
Okay then.

1270
01:22:02,005 --> 01:22:04,718
Did Blanc find anything
suspicious at the house?

1271
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:11,474
Yes, he found mud, upstairs,
where I broke in through the window.

1272
01:22:12,209 --> 01:22:13,800
Identifiable prints?

1273
01:22:14,187 --> 01:22:16,748
- No.
- Good, okay.

1274
01:22:17,519 --> 01:22:19,358
Good. Hey.

1275
01:22:19,358 --> 01:22:23,533
You lay low for a coupe of days. Wait for
this investigation to blow over, and it will.

1276
01:22:23,533 --> 01:22:27,406
'Cause no matter how good that Blanc guy
thinks he is, he's got nothing.

1277
01:22:27,578 --> 01:22:30,081
Hey, Relax.

1278
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,564
Marta get your ass up, what the hell is happening?
There's a guy here and a bunch of stuff.

1279
01:22:35,564 --> 01:22:37,691
Everything's going crazy.
Are we rich?

1280
01:22:39,079 --> 01:22:40,960
Maybe, Alice, I don't know.

1281
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:43,850
I don't even know what that means
but you better get your ass up.

1282
01:22:44,633 --> 01:22:48,170
We don't know much about Marta Cabrera
or her exact relationship...

1283
01:22:48,170 --> 01:22:51,682
Oh my God Marta.
What is all this. What did you do?

1284
01:22:52,444 --> 01:22:54,696
- Is that here?
- Oh, yeah it is.

1285
01:22:55,841 --> 01:22:58,792
Wait, so is that true?
Are we rich?

1286
01:23:02,009 --> 01:23:03,391
Oh my God.

1287
01:23:17,491 --> 01:23:19,811
Good Morning, Mrs. Thrombey.

1288
01:23:24,934 --> 01:23:28,051
Why is grief the providence of youth?

1289
01:23:29,404 --> 01:23:30,977
I don't know.

1290
01:23:32,707 --> 01:23:37,415
But I'd imagine that
age deepens all feelings.

1291
01:23:38,821 --> 01:23:40,949
Including grief.

1292
01:23:43,256 --> 01:23:50,334
This was a long walk to offering
condolences for the loss of your son.

1293
01:23:51,442 --> 01:23:57,353
And asking you if it isn't presumptuous of
me not to think too harshly of your family.

1294
01:23:58,464 --> 01:24:03,188
If I am, as I suspect,
the first to console you.

1295
01:24:04,445 --> 01:24:07,327
They're young, aren't they?

1296
01:24:12,279 --> 01:24:17,775
One thing I assume of age
is weariness.

1297
01:24:18,345 --> 01:24:21,155
Damned if I don't get
more tired every day.

1298
01:24:21,690 --> 01:24:26,655
Tired of what I do.
Following arcs, like lobbed rocks.

1299
01:24:26,832 --> 01:24:29,381
The inevitability of truth.

1300
01:24:32,263 --> 01:24:37,330
But the complexity
and the gray lie not in the truth

1301
01:24:38,576 --> 01:24:42,349
but what you do
with the truth once you have it.

1302
01:24:49,261 --> 01:24:52,940
I think you have something
you wanna tell me.

1303
01:24:54,015 --> 01:24:58,049
I think you're very perceptive
and very capable

1304
01:24:58,049 --> 01:25:02,460
of telling me what you saw
the night of your son's party.

1305
01:25:10,683 --> 01:25:14,844
But I'll happily wait.
I'm in no rush.

1306
01:25:15,995 --> 01:25:20,958
In fact, I find it quite pleasant,
sitting here with you.

1307
01:25:29,101 --> 01:25:31,553
Lawyers were here,
very big lawyers it looked like.

1308
01:25:31,553 --> 01:25:34,064
They left all this stuff
and business cards,

1309
01:25:34,064 --> 01:25:36,245
and there was a pile
of other stuff when I got home.

1310
01:25:37,392 --> 01:25:39,539
I don't like any of this, Marta.

1311
01:25:39,675 --> 01:25:41,347
I don't like it either.

1312
01:25:41,535 --> 01:25:44,265
I'm slipping out the back.
I'll be back later.

1313
01:25:44,265 --> 01:25:46,180
Please don't talk to anyone.

1314
01:25:52,673 --> 01:25:54,014
Walt?

1315
01:25:54,517 --> 01:25:58,654
Yeah, I came from...
Hey, how are you doing?

1316
01:26:01,429 --> 01:26:04,028
Walt, I want you to know
that I didn't know about any of this.

1317
01:26:04,028 --> 01:26:06,707
We know you didn't.
We know you didn't.

1318
01:26:07,005 --> 01:26:10,047
Yeah, we all kinda went
a little crazy yesterday.

1319
01:26:10,047 --> 01:26:12,032
- Understandable.
- Yeah.

1320
01:26:13,428 --> 01:26:15,197
I haven't even looked
at all this yet.

1321
01:26:15,197 --> 01:26:20,324
It must just be local lawyers and accountants
who saw the news and wanna get a jump on it.

1322
01:26:21,078 --> 01:26:23,380
I'd be careful of all of it.

1323
01:26:25,022 --> 01:26:29,294
Marta, is it your intention
to renounce the inheritance?

1324
01:26:32,410 --> 01:26:34,864
This is what Harlan wanted.

1325
01:26:36,739 --> 01:26:41,102
Yeah, but, Harlan put you
in a very hard position here.

1326
01:26:41,863 --> 01:26:43,855
It was unfair of him.

1327
01:26:44,803 --> 01:26:48,829
You see the kind of
press and the scrutiny that this kicks up?

1328
01:26:49,421 --> 01:26:52,050
We know... with your mother.

1329
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:55,164
- My mother?
- Yeah.

1330
01:27:00,625 --> 01:27:02,318
What did Meg tell you?

1331
01:27:03,384 --> 01:27:04,903
This isn't about Meg.

1332
01:27:06,598 --> 01:27:09,750
You're missing the point.
We don't wanna attack you with this.

1333
01:27:10,298 --> 01:27:15,003
Marta, if your mother came into
the country illegally, criminally,

1334
01:27:15,133 --> 01:27:19,089
and you come into this inheritance
with all the scrutiny that entails,

1335
01:27:19,089 --> 01:27:23,456
I'd be afraid that could come to light.
That's what we wanna avoid here.

1336
01:27:23,456 --> 01:27:28,431
We can protect you from
that happening, or if it happens.

1337
01:27:28,753 --> 01:27:32,616
So, you're saying that
even if it came to light.

1338
01:27:33,693 --> 01:27:36,039
With your family's resources
you could help me fix it.

1339
01:27:36,039 --> 01:27:40,946
Yeah, with the right lawyers,
you know, not these local guys,

1340
01:27:40,946 --> 01:27:43,618
but New York lawyers,
DC lawyers.

1341
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:45,881
With enough resources
put toward it, yes.

1342
01:27:45,881 --> 01:27:50,534
Not that that ever even needs
to come up. But yes.

1343
01:27:52,369 --> 01:27:53,923
Okay. Good.

1344
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:56,779
Okay?

1345
01:27:57,814 --> 01:28:01,097
'Cause Harlan gave
me all your resources.

1346
01:28:01,668 --> 01:28:04,517
So, that means with my resources
I'll be able to fix it.

1347
01:28:04,517 --> 01:28:06,872
So, I guess I will find
the right lawyers.

1348
01:28:07,401 --> 01:28:08,901
Marta, that's...

1349
01:28:10,791 --> 01:28:12,852
Better be sure if that's

1350
01:28:13,825 --> 01:28:15,673
what you want.

1351
01:28:53,380 --> 01:28:54,974
I don't know. What's this?

1352
01:28:54,974 --> 01:28:59,116
It's my medical bag tag.
They have my medical bag, for some reason.

1353
01:28:59,357 --> 01:29:04,279
Okay, but this is a photocopy of just the
header of a blood toxicology report on Harlan.

1354
01:29:04,459 --> 01:29:06,660
Marta, this is gonna show
the morphine overdose.

1355
01:29:10,337 --> 01:29:12,099
So I'm screwed!

1356
01:29:13,250 --> 01:29:14,895
How do you know all this stuff?

1357
01:29:14,895 --> 01:29:17,390
I was Harlan's
research assistant for a summer.

1358
01:29:18,443 --> 01:29:20,638
But what kind of blackmail
scheme is this?

1359
01:29:20,724 --> 01:29:23,951
I mean the actual evidence
is sitting up the street at the crime lab.

1360
01:29:23,951 --> 01:29:26,528
There are no demands,
there's no meeting place.

1361
01:29:28,711 --> 01:29:30,717
What's the point
of sending you this?

1362
01:29:40,857 --> 01:29:42,979
Could be a half hour.
Could be an hour.

1363
01:29:42,979 --> 01:29:44,631
We wanna make sure...

1364
01:29:53,468 --> 01:29:55,556
- What's the cheese?
- Hey.

1365
01:29:55,556 --> 01:29:57,020
- Thank you.
- No problem.

1366
01:29:57,694 --> 01:30:00,673
5 AM, security systems
here were all triggered.

1367
01:30:00,912 --> 01:30:02,325
This thing went up really quick.

1368
01:30:02,325 --> 01:30:06,595
So that means blood stores, records,
anything of that nature, it's all gone.

1369
01:30:06,775 --> 01:30:09,880
There were no employees here,
so thank God for that.

1370
01:30:10,919 --> 01:30:13,976
- What about security cameras?
- Oh yeah.

1371
01:30:16,653 --> 01:30:19,776
Speaking of security, the surveillance tape
at the Thrombey estate

1372
01:30:19,776 --> 01:30:22,143
was all scrambled for some reason.

1373
01:30:24,399 --> 01:30:26,562
What's still pending
from the autopsy?

1374
01:30:27,043 --> 01:30:28,867
Just the report on the blood work.

1375
01:30:30,213 --> 01:30:31,939
Blood work?

1376
01:30:36,268 --> 01:30:38,350
Holy shit!

1377
01:30:41,296 --> 01:30:43,254
This is insane!

1378
01:30:43,971 --> 01:30:48,071
I mean who would blow up the whole
real building just to blackmail me?

1379
01:30:48,071 --> 01:30:50,489
Marta this means that the blackmailer
has the only paper copy

1380
01:30:50,489 --> 01:30:52,165
of the thing
that can prove your guilt.

1381
01:30:52,165 --> 01:30:55,448
You didn't get any other instructions,
no phone call, no email, nothing?

1382
01:30:57,605 --> 01:30:59,373
I haven't checked my email.

1383
01:31:04,869 --> 01:31:06,383
There is one.

1384
01:31:06,383 --> 01:31:10,375
That's it. 1209 Columbus Road, 10 AM.

1385
01:31:15,871 --> 01:31:17,091
You know what this means, right?

1386
01:31:17,091 --> 01:31:21,090
If you destroy that copy
you are totally in the clear.

1387
01:31:21,095 --> 01:31:22,547
Oh no!

1388
01:31:23,761 --> 01:31:26,511
Marta, did you hear me?

1389
01:31:27,621 --> 01:31:29,134
Yeah.

1390
01:31:36,966 --> 01:31:39,471
Elliott!
We gotta go! We gotta go!

1391
01:31:42,568 --> 01:31:43,498
Okay, Baby Driver.

1392
01:31:43,506 --> 01:31:45,921
Oh God! You regret helping me yet?

1393
01:31:45,921 --> 01:31:48,170
I regret not taking the beamer.

1394
01:31:49,906 --> 01:31:51,722
Oh shit!

1395
01:32:04,842 --> 01:32:06,647
Vehicles in pursuit in
Washington Street.

1396
01:32:06,647 --> 01:32:08,280
- Make sure you say "No force."
- No force.

1397
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:11,171
- We got a possible murder suspect.
- I said that, I said that.

1398
01:32:12,734 --> 01:32:14,823
Go! Go!
Are you flooring it?

1399
01:32:14,823 --> 01:32:16,902
I am literally flooring it.

1400
01:32:27,569 --> 01:32:29,289
- This is going well.
- I'm pulling over.

1401
01:32:29,289 --> 01:32:32,575
If you miss your chance
to get this tox report it's all over.

1402
01:32:32,575 --> 01:32:34,081
Oh my God!

1403
01:32:38,888 --> 01:32:40,058
Why are we stopping?

1404
01:32:40,058 --> 01:32:42,576
Why are you stopping
in the middle of the road?

1405
01:32:55,696 --> 01:32:57,020
Hold on!

1406
01:33:20,721 --> 01:33:24,759
Oh my God. I'm just pure adrenaline
right now, I feel like I swallowed bees.

1407
01:33:25,078 --> 01:33:27,322
Okay, so, what is it?
What's the address?

1408
01:33:27,322 --> 01:33:29,256
- 1209 Columbus road.
- Okay.

1409
01:33:29,744 --> 01:33:31,899
I mean, whatever they want,
I'll say yes because...

1410
01:33:32,075 --> 01:33:33,564
You know, just to get
that report back.

1411
01:33:33,564 --> 01:33:35,604
- Get it back and destroy it.
- Destroy it.

1412
01:33:36,094 --> 01:33:37,898
Holy shit! Ransom.

1413
01:33:38,781 --> 01:33:42,338
Thank you. I couldn't
do this without you.

1414
01:33:46,153 --> 01:33:47,572
Oh my God!

1415
01:33:48,769 --> 01:33:50,309
Get out!

1416
01:33:51,552 --> 01:33:54,628
That was the dumbest
car chase of all time.

1417
01:33:54,628 --> 01:33:55,805
Put your hands down.

1418
01:33:56,070 --> 01:33:58,468
I spoke to Wanetta Thrombey,
Greatnana.

1419
01:33:58,976 --> 01:34:02,557
The night of the party she saw someone
climbing the trellis to the third floor.

1420
01:34:03,128 --> 01:34:05,340
Mr. Drysdale, come on.

1421
01:34:06,048 --> 01:34:07,648
Pat him down, check him out.

1422
01:34:07,648 --> 01:34:09,388
What's going on?

1423
01:34:09,580 --> 01:34:11,395
"Ransom came back" she said.

1424
01:34:12,335 --> 01:34:15,090
I don't know what he came back to do,
but we'll find out.

1425
01:34:15,183 --> 01:34:16,382
You have anything sharp?

1426
01:34:17,419 --> 01:34:20,086
- Watch your head. Thank you.
- You don't need to thank him.

1427
01:34:20,086 --> 01:34:23,769
Did he ask you to drive
when he saw me coming?

1428
01:34:25,083 --> 01:34:26,629
Yes.

1429
01:34:33,916 --> 01:34:35,327
Blanc, you're coming with us?

1430
01:34:35,327 --> 01:34:36,795
I'll drive with Marta.

1431
01:34:37,522 --> 01:34:39,362
Let's go to the police station.

1432
01:34:39,362 --> 01:34:42,474
I wanna full run down
on everything he said to you.

1433
01:34:42,662 --> 01:34:44,747
And I'll can catch you up
on where we're at.

1434
01:34:51,612 --> 01:34:54,263
Strange case from the start.

1435
01:34:55,501 --> 01:34:58,518
A case with a hole in the middle.

1436
01:35:00,451 --> 01:35:01,982
A donut?

1437
01:35:02,883 --> 01:35:06,849
I'm just talking through my process here,
let me know if this is boring.

1438
01:35:07,780 --> 01:35:12,380
I feel the noose tightening,
the family is truly desperate.

1439
01:35:13,090 --> 01:35:14,765
Desperate motives.

1440
01:35:15,339 --> 01:35:21,698
Then mystery of who hired me,
the impossibility of the crime, and yet...

1441
01:35:22,788 --> 01:35:30,391
A donut! One central piece, and if
it reveals itself the fog would lift,

1442
01:35:30,862 --> 01:35:34,375
the arc would resolve,
the slinky become unkinked.

1443
01:35:34,375 --> 01:35:36,468
Do you mind
if I stop for a second?

1444
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:39,725
I need to pick something up.
It will be very quick.

1445
01:35:41,057 --> 01:35:42,421
Sure.

1446
01:35:55,632 --> 01:35:56,905
It'll be just a few minutes.

1447
01:35:56,905 --> 01:35:59,670
I'll watch the door.

1448
01:36:22,697 --> 01:36:24,661
Hello?

1449
01:36:47,374 --> 01:36:49,171
Listen, I don't know what you want.

1450
01:36:52,190 --> 01:36:54,005
Whatever it is we can work it out.

1451
01:36:54,005 --> 01:36:56,492
But we have to figure it out
right here, right now.

1452
01:36:56,770 --> 01:36:58,508
And I'm leaving with that report.

1453
01:37:03,057 --> 01:37:04,722
Hello?

1454
01:37:29,643 --> 01:37:31,446
Fran?

1455
01:37:40,670 --> 01:37:42,778
No, no, no! Fran.

1456
01:37:45,675 --> 01:37:49,155
Can you hear me?
Fran, give me a sign if you can hear me.

1457
01:37:49,155 --> 01:37:50,114
You.

1458
01:37:50,114 --> 01:37:51,801
Yes, it's me, it's Marta.

1459
01:37:51,801 --> 01:37:54,409
You called me here, you sent
me an email, that's why I'm here.

1460
01:37:54,409 --> 01:37:55,602
Did you take something?

1461
01:37:55,602 --> 01:37:58,220
I'm gonna call an ambulance now
and you're going to be okay.

1462
01:37:58,220 --> 01:38:00,168
You gonna be fine, okay?
Stay with me.

1463
01:38:00,538 --> 01:38:01,491
What?

1464
01:38:01,491 --> 01:38:02,812
Help me.

1465
01:38:03,539 --> 01:38:04,793
- Stashed.
- What?

1466
01:38:04,793 --> 01:38:06,633
What are you saying?

1467
01:38:07,209 --> 01:38:09,401
You did this!

1468
01:38:09,401 --> 01:38:11,492
You won't get away with this!

1469
01:38:11,492 --> 01:38:13,588
Jesus! Stop!

1470
01:38:35,151 --> 01:38:37,443

Oh lord.

1475
01:39:00,543 --> 01:39:02,854
All right my friend,
thank you for the update.

1476
01:39:04,291 --> 01:39:08,767
No need for that, I'll bring her in once
we get word that the housekeeper is stable.

1477
01:39:08,767 --> 01:39:11,833
It's still touch and go. All right.

1478
01:39:13,377 --> 01:39:16,191
This is over.
People are getting hurt.

1479
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:19,642
So, I'm gonna tell you
the truth.

1480
01:39:19,642 --> 01:39:23,816
Young Ransom just told
Lieutenant Elliott everything.

1481
01:39:24,023 --> 01:39:27,166
Good. Wait, I hope
he didn't cover for me.

1482
01:39:27,166 --> 01:39:29,793
Did he tell the real truth
about me switching the...

1483
01:39:29,793 --> 01:39:30,625
Yeah.

1484
01:39:30,625 --> 01:39:32,723
- And the disguise...
- Yes.

1485
01:39:32,723 --> 01:39:34,433
And the whole blackmailing...

1486
01:39:35,242 --> 01:39:37,399
But why did Fran take my morphine?

1487
01:39:37,860 --> 01:39:39,826
Obviously, she had swiped
a bag from the house,

1488
01:39:39,826 --> 01:39:43,970
but she didn't seem like a user to me, unless
that's why she needed the blackmail money...

1489
01:39:44,249 --> 01:39:46,262
I don't know,
it doesn't matter anyway.

1490
01:39:46,627 --> 01:39:49,601
I have to tell the Thrombeys myself,
I feel like I owe that to them.

1491
01:39:49,601 --> 01:39:50,770
I don't think that's a good idea.

1492
01:39:50,770 --> 01:39:52,945
No, I have to do it!
I need to do it!

1493
01:39:55,212 --> 01:39:58,383
I gave the doctors my number, so they'll
call if anything changes with Fran.

1494
01:39:58,383 --> 01:39:59,508
All right.

1495
01:39:59,508 --> 01:40:02,778
We'll round up the Thrombeys
at the house, along with a police escort.

1496
01:40:03,347 --> 01:40:05,542
For the arrest after.

1497
01:40:05,736 --> 01:40:08,761
You can tell me your whole
story on the drive over.

1498
01:40:09,293 --> 01:40:11,610
I don't want any more surprises.

1499
01:40:27,026 --> 01:40:29,311
Fran said it was stashed, the copy,

1500
01:40:29,477 --> 01:40:33,443
and then she said,
"you did this, you won't get away with it."

1501
01:40:34,850 --> 01:40:37,961
I called the ambulance. That's it.

1502
01:40:39,112 --> 01:40:40,483
All right.

1503
01:40:42,239 --> 01:40:44,088
You ready?

1504
01:40:50,751 --> 01:40:54,005
Okay, has she come
to her senses?

1505
01:40:54,228 --> 01:40:56,463
She's standing right there Richard,
she can speak for herself.

1506
01:40:56,463 --> 01:40:58,041
Is the rest of the family here?

1507
01:40:58,041 --> 01:40:59,943
- In the living room.
- I think it would be better if we were

1508
01:40:59,943 --> 01:41:02,549
to gather together
and get this over with.

1509
01:41:08,056 --> 01:41:09,891
- Hey.
- Hey.

1510
01:41:11,830 --> 01:41:13,574
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry I told them
about your mom.

1511
01:41:13,574 --> 01:41:15,454
Meg, it's okay.

1512
01:41:16,170 --> 01:41:18,864
I'm sorry. No, I was scared, I just,
I didn't wanna tell them...

1513
01:41:18,864 --> 01:41:21,595
I get it. Trust me.

1514
01:41:22,689 --> 01:41:24,945
I understand. It's all right.

1515
01:41:25,943 --> 01:41:27,645
I'm sorry.

1516
01:41:30,049 --> 01:41:32,721
God, I'm so raiding Fran's
stash after this.

1517
01:41:32,913 --> 01:41:38,184
I still think this is a bad idea,
but the family is assembled.

1518
01:41:41,628 --> 01:41:43,925
I know where the tox report is.

1519
01:41:50,862 --> 01:41:52,751
She basically told me where it was.

1520
01:41:55,249 --> 01:41:57,418
Anyway this will tie everything up.

1521
01:41:59,293 --> 01:42:01,376
And I just handed it to you.

1522
01:42:02,378 --> 01:42:05,130
God, you're not much
of a detective, are you?

1523
01:42:05,912 --> 01:42:07,418
To be fair.

1524
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,889
You make a pretty lousy murderer.

1525
01:42:13,302 --> 01:42:15,731
Perhaps we deserve each other.

1526
01:42:27,168 --> 01:42:29,693
You've always been good to me.

1527
01:42:31,164 --> 01:42:34,853
What I'm about to say isn't gonna be easy
and you're gonna be upset.

1528
01:42:35,487 --> 01:42:38,898
But I thought after what
you've gone through the last few days,

1529
01:42:39,644 --> 01:42:42,666
that you deserved
to hear it from me.

1530
01:42:44,884 --> 01:42:45,344
I...

1531
01:42:45,344 --> 01:42:46,782
Excuse me!

1532
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:53,180
You have not been
good to her.

1533
01:42:53,726 --> 01:42:57,717
You have all treated her like shit
to steal back a fortune

1534
01:42:57,717 --> 01:42:59,931
that you lost and she deserves.

1535
01:43:00,091 --> 01:43:03,116
You're a pack of vultures
at the feast.

1536
01:43:03,116 --> 01:43:05,316
Nose all beak's bloody.

1537
01:43:05,316 --> 01:43:09,862
Well, you're not getting
bailed out, not this time.

1538
01:43:10,622 --> 01:43:15,243
Ms. Cabrera has decided definitively
not to renounce the inheritance.

1539
01:43:15,243 --> 01:43:16,140
What?

1540
01:43:16,496 --> 01:43:17,075
What?

1541
01:43:17,075 --> 01:43:21,318
Furthermore, it will be my professional
recommendation to the local authorities

1542
01:43:21,318 --> 01:43:23,923
that the manner of death
in the case of Harlan Thrombey

1543
01:43:23,923 --> 01:43:27,952
is ruled as suicide,
and the case is closed.

1544
01:43:27,952 --> 01:43:28,969
- Blanc.
- What?

1545
01:43:28,969 --> 01:43:30,707
Thank you all for coming.
Goodbye.

1546
01:43:30,707 --> 01:43:31,946
What's going on?

1547
01:43:31,946 --> 01:43:33,297
Just tell me what's...

1548
01:43:34,581 --> 01:43:37,265
That's certainly not
what I was expecting.

1549
01:43:38,201 --> 01:43:39,320
Is anybody else confused?

1550
01:43:39,320 --> 01:43:41,654
Not what I was
expecting to hear at all.

1551
01:43:44,494 --> 01:43:45,998
Are you gonna tell me
what the hell is going on?

1552
01:43:45,998 --> 01:43:46,881
Yes.

1553
01:43:46,881 --> 01:43:49,037
I just wanna come clean, okay?

1554
01:43:49,037 --> 01:43:50,307
- It's over.
- Almost.

1555
01:43:50,307 --> 01:43:51,641
Blanc, what are we doing?

1556
01:43:51,641 --> 01:43:53,955
I'm sorry. Officer Wagner.

1557
01:43:54,412 --> 01:43:57,362
Keep the family out of this room,
get them out of the house if you can.

1558
01:43:57,362 --> 01:43:59,619
But stand by
with your additional officer.

1559
01:43:59,619 --> 01:44:01,843
- Get the family out?
- Yes, but not all of them.

1560
01:44:03,433 --> 01:44:04,091
Blanc.

1561
01:44:04,091 --> 01:44:05,224
- Yes, sir.
- Come on. Come on.

1562
01:44:05,224 --> 01:44:06,273
What's with all this drama?

1563
01:44:06,273 --> 01:44:07,333
Indulge me.

1564
01:44:07,333 --> 01:44:11,111
Blanc. I told Ransom, Ransom told
you, I'm telling you now -

1565
01:44:11,730 --> 01:44:14,463
it is an immovable fact
that I killed Harlan.

1566
01:44:14,463 --> 01:44:17,728
Yes, you did. Yes, he did.
Yes, you are, but. But.

1567
01:44:18,292 --> 01:44:22,147
I spoke in the car about the hole
at the center of this donut.

1568
01:44:22,665 --> 01:44:26,509
And what you and Harlan did that fateful
night seems at first glance

1569
01:44:26,509 --> 01:44:28,377
to fill that hole perfectly.

1570
01:44:28,532 --> 01:44:31,098
A donut hole in a donut's hole.

1571
01:44:31,942 --> 01:44:33,980
But we must look a little closer.

1572
01:44:34,669 --> 01:44:39,736
And when we do, we see that
the donut hole has a hole in its center.

1573
01:44:39,909 --> 01:44:44,921
It is not a donut hole, but a smaller
donut with its own hole,

1574
01:44:45,074 --> 01:44:47,929
and our donut is not holed at all!

1575
01:44:47,929 --> 01:44:50,220
Blanc, look, I understand that
this is amusing for you.

1576
01:44:50,220 --> 01:44:54,843
Why was I hired?
Why would someone hire me?

1577
01:44:54,843 --> 01:44:57,416
Someone fishing for a crime
to reverse the will, Blanc.

1578
01:44:57,416 --> 01:44:59,887
I was hired before
the sealed will was read.

1579
01:45:00,273 --> 01:45:04,217
So yes, the person must have
known the contents of the will.

1580
01:45:04,832 --> 01:45:09,182
But one step further - that same person
must have known a crime was committed,

1581
01:45:09,182 --> 01:45:10,449
and further,

1582
01:45:10,987 --> 01:45:15,036
if the intent was to reverse
Marta's inheritance,

1583
01:45:15,944 --> 01:45:18,557
they must've known
that Marta was responsible.

1584
01:45:19,261 --> 01:45:23,277
An intriguing combination of factors.
Someone who knew what Marta did,

1585
01:45:23,277 --> 01:45:26,724
wanted to expose it,
but could not reveal how they knew.

1586
01:45:26,886 --> 01:45:30,943
Fran! She was blackmailing me,
she knew what I did.

1587
01:45:31,093 --> 01:45:35,055
But Fran wanted money,
ergo she did not want the crime exposed.

1588
01:45:35,055 --> 01:45:37,881
Did someone in the family observe Marta
doing something suspicious?

1589
01:45:37,881 --> 01:45:41,031
But they would've had no reason
not to speak up.

1590
01:45:43,108 --> 01:45:46,005
The answer is not so simple.

1591
01:45:46,874 --> 01:45:51,136
Now with the entire solution
in my field of view.

1592
01:45:51,136 --> 01:45:54,355
The arc of this case
is a tragedy of errors.

1593
01:45:56,744 --> 01:45:59,167
And Marta, it will not be easy
for you to hear.

1594
01:45:59,773 --> 01:46:05,494
But there is at least one
truly guilty party behind it all,

1595
01:46:05,494 --> 01:46:08,577
guilty in the true sense
of acting with malice,

1596
01:46:09,084 --> 01:46:12,007
committing a heinous crime
with selfish intent.

1597
01:46:14,979 --> 01:46:16,535
Trooper Wagner.

1598
01:46:16,535 --> 01:46:18,124
Trooper Wagner?

1599
01:46:19,335 --> 01:46:20,722
No.

1600
01:46:22,248 --> 01:46:26,070
Marta, I'm so sorry. I told them
everything, I figured it was up. I'm sorry.

1601
01:46:26,070 --> 01:46:28,360
It's all right, Ransom,
I'm glad you did.

1602
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:30,594
Not exactly everything though.

1603
01:46:30,995 --> 01:46:32,992
Is this about what
Greatnana told you?

1604
01:46:33,290 --> 01:46:36,415
She saw me that night,
she mistook me for Ransom.

1605
01:46:36,415 --> 01:46:38,907
We'll get to that.
In the meanwhile,

1606
01:46:39,386 --> 01:46:41,804
Mr. Hugh Ransom Drysdale,

1607
01:46:42,141 --> 01:46:46,207
you might tell us all
why you hired me?

1608
01:46:49,422 --> 01:46:51,034
Why I hired you?

1609
01:46:51,536 --> 01:46:55,149
You're right, let's back up.
To the night of the party.

1610
01:46:55,259 --> 01:46:57,358
Your argument with Harlan.

1611
01:46:57,808 --> 01:47:02,180
What were the overheard words by the
Nazi child, masturbating in the bathroom?

1612
01:47:02,406 --> 01:47:05,529
"My will" and
"I'm warning you."

1613
01:47:06,059 --> 01:47:11,727
You and Harlan were "drama mamas," you shared a
love of twisting the knife into one another.

1614
01:47:11,749 --> 01:47:15,667
You see, I don't believe he would've
slipped it in halfway - no, no, no.

1615
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:20,674
I submit Harlan told you everything.

1616
01:47:20,796 --> 01:47:22,156
You can't be serious!

1617
01:47:22,156 --> 01:47:28,199
Not a red dime or word of my work
to a single one of them, you included.

1618
01:47:28,708 --> 01:47:34,201
Marta, remind me what Ransom said
his conversation with Harlan ended with.

1619
01:47:34,747 --> 01:47:37,233
Harlan told him that I could beat
him at GO.

1620
01:47:37,233 --> 01:47:40,161
And I asked myself - Marta?

1621
01:47:40,528 --> 01:47:44,582
How would the topic of the will
have steered around to Marta?

1622
01:47:46,022 --> 01:47:49,248
There is one obvious explanation.

1623
01:47:49,359 --> 01:47:52,247
You can't be that crazy, you're not
just gonna throw away your fortune.

1624
01:47:52,247 --> 01:47:55,519
No. I'm giving it to Marta.
All of it.

1625
01:47:56,816 --> 01:47:59,518
Your Brazilian nurse?
Are you goddamn insane?

1626
01:47:59,518 --> 01:48:03,785
I am sane for the first time
in my life and I've done it.

1627
01:48:04,494 --> 01:48:07,437
I've made the change
to my will, it's done.

1628
01:48:07,735 --> 01:48:09,018
I'm warning you!

1629
01:48:09,956 --> 01:48:12,193
That's some heavy duty conjecture.

1630
01:48:12,243 --> 01:48:13,679
Granted.

1631
01:48:13,881 --> 01:48:17,349
But it is the only way of
what comes next makes sense.

1632
01:48:17,742 --> 01:48:21,303
So, you storm out,
you drive off into the night.

1633
01:48:22,062 --> 01:48:26,370
You tell Marta later of, what was it?
Feeling an overwhelming sense of...

1634
01:48:26,551 --> 01:48:31,056
Clarity. That he has to make do
for himself from here on out.

1635
01:48:31,381 --> 01:48:32,940
Exactly!

1636
01:48:35,579 --> 01:48:40,001
Marta. The will. Harlan.
Do for yourself.

1637
01:48:40,001 --> 01:48:42,260
"You won't get away with this."

1638
01:48:42,762 --> 01:48:44,793
And a plan forms.

1639
01:48:53,251 --> 01:48:57,691
You return, careful to avoid the
gate's security camera range.

1640
01:48:57,841 --> 01:49:00,106
Then on foot up towards the house.

1641
01:49:00,245 --> 01:49:04,554
You sneak in, up the trellis so as
not to be seen by the rest of the family,

1642
01:49:04,554 --> 01:49:07,231
who are still having their
party downstairs.

1643
01:49:09,156 --> 01:49:12,523
What you need to do
will take moments.

1644
01:49:13,098 --> 01:49:17,204
But it is essential that
you are alone and undetected.

1645
01:49:17,512 --> 01:49:19,968
You knew what medications Harlan took.

1646
01:49:19,968 --> 01:49:22,740
You knew what Marta would be
injecting him with that night.

1647
01:49:24,058 --> 01:49:31,403
And you knew if Marta was responsible
for his death, even unintentionally,

1648
01:49:32,228 --> 01:49:37,824
the slayer rule would nullify the changed
will, and you would get your share back.

1649
01:49:38,733 --> 01:49:43,101
You use the syringes in the kit to switch
the liquids in the two medication vials.

1650
01:49:43,101 --> 01:49:46,072
And, as a final precaution,

1651
01:49:47,994 --> 01:49:53,222
you took the Naloxone,
the life saving antidote.

1652
01:49:53,621 --> 01:49:55,847
No, no. That's impossible.

1653
01:49:56,073 --> 01:49:57,516
It is the truth.

1654
01:49:57,687 --> 01:50:00,242
Hand me that vial of morphine,
I'll show you.

1655
01:50:00,242 --> 01:50:05,229
If he did that, if the meds were switched,
then when I got them mixed up...

1656
01:50:07,334 --> 01:50:09,991
I accidentally switched them back.

1657
01:50:10,887 --> 01:50:12,061
I gave Harlan...

1658
01:50:12,061 --> 01:50:13,800
The correct doses.

1659
01:50:14,119 --> 01:50:15,715
Yes.

1660
01:50:17,785 --> 01:50:19,771
But not accidentally.

1661
01:50:20,774 --> 01:50:24,369
I taped over the labels
of these two vials.

1662
01:50:25,246 --> 01:50:28,283
The vials themselves are identical.

1663
01:50:30,605 --> 01:50:32,838
How'd you know
that this was the morphine?

1664
01:50:33,273 --> 01:50:34,723
I just knew.

1665
01:50:34,723 --> 01:50:37,891
You knew because there is the slightest,
almost imperceptible difference

1666
01:50:37,891 --> 01:50:40,481
of tincture and viscosity
between the two liquids.

1667
01:50:42,426 --> 01:50:45,963
You knew because you'd done it
a hundred times.

1668
01:50:46,917 --> 01:50:52,560
You gave him the correct medication
because you are a good nurse.

1669
01:50:53,485 --> 01:50:54,442
Then Harlan was...

1670
01:50:54,442 --> 01:50:57,089
I'm sorry Marta, but yes.

1671
01:50:58,169 --> 01:51:00,385
Harlan was perfectly fine.

1672
01:51:01,204 --> 01:51:03,076
His blood was normal.

1673
01:51:03,609 --> 01:51:09,536
The cause of death was truly, solely
suicide, and you are guilty of nothing

1674
01:51:09,536 --> 01:51:12,554
but some damage to the trellis
and a few amateur theatrics.

1675
01:51:13,437 --> 01:51:18,058
In fact, if Harlan had listened to you
and called the ambulance,

1676
01:51:19,568 --> 01:51:22,071
he would be alive today.

1677
01:51:24,489 --> 01:51:26,080
Hot damn.

1678
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:27,887
A twisted web.

1679
01:51:28,807 --> 01:51:32,293
And we are not finished
untangling it. Not yet.

1680
01:51:32,966 --> 01:51:37,206
Marta, when Greatnana spotted you
climbing down the trellis she said,

1681
01:51:38,460 --> 01:51:42,173
Ransom? Are you back again already?

1682
01:51:42,173 --> 01:51:46,573
"Are you back <i>again</i> already?"
'Cause earlier that night

1683
01:51:49,626 --> 01:51:52,190
Ransom, you're back!

1684
01:51:54,331 --> 01:51:55,718
Come on, Marta.

1685
01:51:55,718 --> 01:51:59,316
This is stoopid with two o's.
You don't have a shred of evidence,

1686
01:51:59,316 --> 01:52:00,618
You're just spinning a fairy tale.

1687
01:52:00,618 --> 01:52:02,499
Not a shred, no.

1688
01:52:02,674 --> 01:52:05,856
Just as we have no real proof
of Marta's mixing up the vials.

1689
01:52:05,856 --> 01:52:08,490
- So it's your word against.
- You have her confession!

1690
01:52:11,149 --> 01:52:14,596
All right, yeah.
Yeah, we do have that.

1691
01:52:14,596 --> 01:52:17,241
With your permission,
I'd like to spin a little further.

1692
01:52:17,910 --> 01:52:20,606
Much later that night you'd have
to come back to the house

1693
01:52:20,606 --> 01:52:23,108
to retrieve the incriminating
tampered vials.

1694
01:52:23,428 --> 01:52:26,853
However, this time
the dogs were outside.

1695
01:52:29,196 --> 01:52:31,326
They barked waking Meg.

1696
01:52:31,326 --> 01:52:34,151
No matter.
You'll get the vials tomorrow.

1697
01:52:34,605 --> 01:52:38,947
But tomorrow brings news,
not of a medical error and guilty nurse,

1698
01:52:38,947 --> 01:52:41,918
but of a slit throat and suicide.

1699
01:52:46,051 --> 01:52:51,009
Now the circumstances are perfect
for the anonymous hiring of a me:

1700
01:52:51,524 --> 01:52:53,674
you know a crime has been committed
by Ms. Cabrera,

1701
01:52:53,674 --> 01:52:58,226
you need her to be caught for it,
you cannot reveal how you know.

1702
01:52:59,993 --> 01:53:02,508
Enter Benoit Blanc.

1703
01:53:02,970 --> 01:53:05,793
Benny, look I hear
what you are saying, it's just...

1704
01:53:06,639 --> 01:53:08,679
The body is discovered
early the next morning.

1705
01:53:08,679 --> 01:53:13,426
The police, the medical examiners,
the family, everyone swarms in,

1706
01:53:13,426 --> 01:53:18,417
and there is no possible way you can get to
Marta's medical bag to retrieve the vials.

1707
01:53:18,598 --> 01:53:21,760
You must wait for your moment
when the investigation is over

1708
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:24,772
and you know
the house will be empty.

1709
01:53:25,376 --> 01:53:29,039
That is why you missed the funeral.

1710
01:53:30,205 --> 01:53:33,929
There is no one home to wonder
why you're going into Harlan's study.

1711
01:53:35,165 --> 01:53:36,819
Or so you think.

1712
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:45,403
Poor Fran. She witnessed you tampering with
Harlan's medication in the medical bag.

1713
01:53:45,453 --> 01:53:48,857
She did not know
what you were doing.

1714
01:53:49,187 --> 01:53:53,962
But she knew you were up to no good,
so her mind begins to turn.

1715
01:53:53,962 --> 01:53:58,648
Oh God, that Hallmark movie
she told me about, with Danica McKellar.

1716
01:53:58,822 --> 01:54:00,089
"Deadly By Surprise."

1717
01:54:00,089 --> 01:54:01,598
That's what she
was talking about.

1718
01:54:01,748 --> 01:54:04,867
She loved Harlan. She hates Ransom.

1719
01:54:05,313 --> 01:54:09,349
So the poor girl decides to test her theory
and make this asshole pay.

1720
01:54:09,349 --> 01:54:15,941
She gets a copy of the toxicology report,
I will be honest I have no idea how.

1721
01:54:15,941 --> 01:54:17,780
'Cause she has a cousin.

1722
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:21,624
She told me, she has a cousin who works
as a receptionist at the examiners office.

1723
01:54:21,624 --> 01:54:23,106
Well, Voilà!

1724
01:54:23,106 --> 01:54:25,876
The numbers, they mean
nothing to her,

1725
01:54:25,876 --> 01:54:29,556
but if Ransom is guilty,
its existence is a threat,

1726
01:54:29,556 --> 01:54:33,113
so she photocopies the header
and makes her blackmail note.

1727
01:54:33,819 --> 01:54:35,363
So, why did she send it to me?

1728
01:54:35,363 --> 01:54:38,703
She didn't. She sent it to Ransom.

1729
01:54:43,796 --> 01:54:47,944
And when Mr. Drysdale gets it,
what is his reaction?

1730
01:54:48,464 --> 01:54:53,345
Elation! He still thinks Marta has
given Harlan the tampered drugs!

1731
01:54:53,345 --> 01:54:56,026
A blood tox report
will prove her guilt.

1732
01:54:56,197 --> 01:55:01,197
He goes to the will reading in high spirits,
ready to see the family tear itself apart,

1733
01:55:01,197 --> 01:55:06,676
secure in the knowledge it will all be
undone when the tox report comes to light.

1734
01:55:07,609 --> 01:55:09,346
And then...

1735
01:55:10,198 --> 01:55:12,186
Marta's confession.

1736
01:55:12,581 --> 01:55:15,071
And everything turns on its head.

1737
01:55:15,071 --> 01:55:19,423
Now he realizes that Marta
has committed no crime,

1738
01:55:19,423 --> 01:55:23,202
and the tox report
will prove her innocence.

1739
01:55:23,515 --> 01:55:27,784
The changed will is gonna stand.
He has lost.

1740
01:55:29,572 --> 01:55:31,175
Unless...

1741
01:55:31,736 --> 01:55:33,505
Unless you decide.

1742
01:55:33,505 --> 01:55:34,783
You're not gonna
give up the money.

1743
01:55:34,783 --> 01:55:36,812
You're not gonna
give up the money.

1744
01:55:36,871 --> 01:55:39,509
- You've come this far!
- You've come this far!

1745
01:55:40,390 --> 01:55:42,757
Just one step further.

1746
01:55:42,946 --> 01:55:48,037
Just one last act,
in for a penny, in for a pound.

1747
01:55:50,653 --> 01:55:52,849
You decide. You are in.

1748
01:55:57,644 --> 01:56:02,969
Step one: destroy all evidence
of Marta's innocence.

1749
01:56:09,447 --> 01:56:15,463
Step two: send her the anonymous email
with a late morning rendezvous time,

1750
01:56:19,080 --> 01:56:22,153
and deliver her the blackmail note.

1751
01:56:24,498 --> 01:56:29,020
Step three: keep your appointment
with Fran.

1752
01:56:30,836 --> 01:56:35,166
I knew it! I knew you were
a no good son of a bitch!

1753
01:56:35,504 --> 01:56:37,379
I knew Harlan wouldn't
just kill himself.

1754
01:56:37,734 --> 01:56:39,386
Yes, Fran, you are right.

1755
01:56:39,550 --> 01:56:43,994
I knew you were guilty as shit.
And now you're gonna pay for it!

1756
01:56:44,334 --> 01:56:45,800
Don't you come near me!

1757
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:47,782
Don't come near me,
I'm warning you!

1758
01:56:58,550 --> 01:57:02,147
Now the board is set.
Marta will get the blackmail note.

1759
01:57:02,147 --> 01:57:04,116
You'll put the pieces together for her.

1760
01:57:04,283 --> 01:57:06,292
You'll guide her to the rendezvous.

1761
01:57:06,446 --> 01:57:08,404
You'll make an anonymous call
to the police.

1762
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:11,496
They will catch her there
with the body and the burned evidence.

1763
01:57:11,496 --> 01:57:15,487
Marta will get arrested
for killing Fran and Harlan.

1764
01:57:17,023 --> 01:57:17,871
She said:

1765
01:57:17,871 --> 01:57:19,578
You did this!

1766
01:57:20,524 --> 01:57:26,447
She didn't say "<i>you</i> did this,"
she wasn't talking about me, she said,

1767
01:57:26,447 --> 01:57:28,848
Hugh did this.

1768
01:57:28,848 --> 01:57:33,099
Hugh did this, 'cause you made
the help call you Hugh.

1769
01:57:34,489 --> 01:57:36,355
'Cause you're an asshole.

1770
01:57:37,171 --> 01:57:39,128
It would have worked.

1771
01:57:39,495 --> 01:57:44,099
If we hadn't have brought you in for questioning,
so you could not make your anonymous call.

1772
01:57:44,099 --> 01:57:48,154
And if Fran had not stashed
a safety copy of the tox report.

1773
01:57:48,664 --> 01:57:52,605
And if Marta had not outplayed you
once again,

1774
01:57:53,671 --> 01:57:55,658
by having a kind heart.

1775
01:57:57,584 --> 01:57:59,827
By saving Fran's life,

1776
01:58:00,164 --> 01:58:03,425
though it meant her losing the inheritance
and going to jail.

1777
01:58:03,425 --> 01:58:08,524
She didn't play your game,
she saved Fran's life.

1778
01:58:11,740 --> 01:58:13,230
Fran's alive?

1779
01:58:13,579 --> 01:58:14,988
Oh yes.

1780
01:58:14,988 --> 01:58:21,934
Fran, who will confirm this
fairy story or something close to it.

1781
01:58:22,855 --> 01:58:27,892
And send you, Hugh, to jail.

1782
01:58:32,583 --> 01:58:34,209
Yes.

1783
01:58:37,057 --> 01:58:41,785
Doctor, that's great news.
We'll be there soon. Thank you.

1784
01:58:46,432 --> 01:58:49,329
She's okay. She's ready to talk.

1785
01:58:49,782 --> 01:58:53,185
Trooper Wagner, if you could
keep Mr. Drysdale in custody

1786
01:58:53,185 --> 01:58:55,660
while Lieutenant Elliott,
Ms. Cabrera and myself

1787
01:58:55,772 --> 01:58:57,924
we go to the hospital
and take Fran's statement.

1788
01:58:57,924 --> 01:58:59,809
All right. Up. Come on.

1789
01:59:05,634 --> 01:59:07,376
I'm gonna say this just to you.

1790
01:59:07,733 --> 01:59:10,925
No cameras, no courtroom, just to you
because you know it's the truth.

1791
01:59:11,754 --> 01:59:13,637
We allowed you into our home.

1792
01:59:13,637 --> 01:59:16,949
We let you watch our granddad,
we welcomed you into our family.

1793
01:59:16,949 --> 01:59:19,177
And now you think
you can steal it from us?

1794
01:59:19,177 --> 01:59:23,508
You think I'm not gonna fight
to protect my home, our birthright,

1795
01:59:24,364 --> 01:59:27,058
our ancestral family home?

1796
01:59:29,219 --> 01:59:30,408
That is hooey!

1797
01:59:30,819 --> 01:59:34,526
Harlan, he bought this place in the 80s
from a Pakistani real estate billionaire.

1798
01:59:34,526 --> 01:59:36,445
Oh, shut up Blanc! Shut up!

1799
01:59:36,445 --> 01:59:41,296
Shut up with that Kentucky fried
fog horn rag-horn drawl.

1800
01:59:41,661 --> 01:59:45,264
Yeah, I killed Fran, but I guess I didn't.
So what do you have on me?

1801
01:59:45,428 --> 01:59:47,314
Nothing. What?
Attempted murder?

1802
01:59:47,314 --> 01:59:50,754
I get arson for the building, and a few
other charges, with a good lawyer,

1803
01:59:50,754 --> 01:59:53,597
which I have,
I'll be out in no time.

1804
01:59:53,597 --> 01:59:59,733
And then you'll see just how much hell I can
wreak on your life, you vicious little bitch.

1805
02:00:07,237 --> 02:00:08,742
What the shit!?

1806
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:12,818
- That means she's lying!
- Yeah, man, we know.

1807
02:00:12,818 --> 02:00:16,280
That's right, Fran's dead.

1808
02:00:20,263 --> 02:00:22,648
And you just confessed to her murder.

1809
02:00:35,130 --> 02:00:36,507
Well...

1810
02:00:37,362 --> 02:00:38,918
In for a penny...

1811
02:01:23,044 --> 02:01:24,614
Shit!

1812
02:02:51,809 --> 02:02:55,826
...He's cheating on you, I have proof I know you
don't need to see. Untether yourself - Dad.

1813
02:02:57,275 --> 02:02:59,534
Linda?

1814
02:02:59,861 --> 02:03:02,802
We gotta get the attorneys
on the phone. Right now!

1815
02:03:10,401 --> 02:03:15,017
Can I ask? When did you know I had
something to do with Harlan's death?

1816
02:03:15,994 --> 02:03:19,759
From the first moment you
set foot in front of me.

1817
02:03:23,854 --> 02:03:24,995
Oh shit!

1818
02:03:24,995 --> 02:03:28,962
I want you to remember
something that's very important:

1819
02:03:29,568 --> 02:03:35,625
you won not by playing the game
Harlan's way, but yours.

1820
02:03:37,829 --> 02:03:40,223
You're a good person.

1821
02:03:41,508 --> 02:03:43,174
This family.

1822
02:03:49,082 --> 02:03:51,487
I should help them, right?

1823
02:03:52,741 --> 02:03:55,071
I have my own opinion.

1824
02:03:56,200 --> 02:03:59,397
But I have a feeling
you'll follow your heart.

1825
02:05:05,622 --> 02:05:09,752
