1
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,125
It's a long story.

2
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,208
You aren't hurt, are you?

3
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:41,333
-Hey, Bandu.
-I'll get you a rickshaw.

4
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,291
It will cost you ten rupees.

5
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:46,916
Here.

6
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:52,166
If you do that again,
I'll tie that string to your undies.

7
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,958
-Now, get me an auto.
-Auto!

8
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,208
Welcome.

9
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,541
I've got you two new pupils.

10
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:33,333
-I cannot take it up.
-Why?

11
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,750
That kid at Viman Nagar drives me nuts.

12
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:39,500
And Mrs. Gokhale keeps groping me.

13
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:41,875
-Aabha Gokhale?
-Yes.

14
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:45,125
She runs her fingers over me
more than she runs them over the piano.

15
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:49,458
The competition is due in two months.
I need time to concentrate and practice.

16
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,500
There's a musical piece
I can't seem to crack.

17
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:54,291
With Aabha Gokhale's help
you can get to London.

18
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,291
Keep her happy.

19
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,583
I need inspiration, not perspiration.

20
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,541
When you're blind,
days and nights feel the same.

21
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:09,958
And if you listen closely,
there's music in every sound.

22
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:23,041
Everyone is aware of the problems
that come with blindness.

23
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,833
I'll tell you what the advantage is.
It's focus!

24
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,875
For artists, focus is everything.

25
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:33,166
Artists like me are constantly
searching for inspiration.

26
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,125
Day in and day out.

27
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,750
Art gives a lot of meaning
to an artist's life.

28
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,125
But he has to pay a price for that.

29
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:51,041
You're the rain that quenches my thirst

30
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:54,916
I've waited for you forever

31
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,875
You bring peace to me

32
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,625
My sweet love

33
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,041
A comment from Denmark.

34
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,541
Hamlet was from Denmark.

35
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,833
Yes, darling

36
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,208
Daani is on the line.

37
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I hear you're going to go scuba diving.

38
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,166
Yes. Classes start next week.

39
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,208
Is Dad exercising?

40
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,958
He jogs for one whole hour every day.

41
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:23,750
Why does she keep calling me "Aunty?"
She can call me "Simi" at least.

42
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,583
She's just a kid. Give her some time.

43
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,875
We've been married for
three years, Pramod.

44
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,000
How much time does she need, after all?

45
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,833
If I put the crab in boiling water
it will surely die.

46
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,916
But I don't want it to experience shock.

47
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:50,625
So, for two hours before cooking...

48
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,833
I put it in the deep freezer.

49
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:59,041
And when it is fast asleep...

50
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:04,000
I take it out.

51
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,708
That's when I lay it gently
into boiling water.

52
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,541
They say that crab meat is an aphrodisiac.

53
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,375
Don't ask me to spell it.

54
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,708
But I can show you what it means.

55
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,958
You've made my day.

56
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,208
You should have your own show.
Shall I have a word with the TV producers?

57
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,208
The Sizzling Hot Simi Show!

58
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,208
A bunch of lies!

59
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:48,666
How dare you come into my room
and talk to me like that?

60
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,166
What do you think of me?

61
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,583
Simi, hold on. Want some water?

62
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,208
Don't come near me!

63
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,916
I know why you're here.

64
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,916
You want to poison me.

65
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,791
It's not that easy to get rid of me.

66
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:05,500
What is it? Why aren't you recording?

67
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,333
I was auditioning

68
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,208
for the show Nurse Radha, Part Two.

69
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:15,791
Listen to the story idea.

70
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,458
In the very first scene Nurse Radha
escapes from the mental asylum.

71
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,416
The show can be produced on a low budget.

72
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,875
Talk to your friends who
work in the film industry.

73
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,333
You're unbelievable!

74
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:37,666
Are you blind?
Can't you see my yellow scooter?

75
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,666
I'm talking to you. Hello!

76
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,750
Don't roll the window up.
How dare you put on your glasses!

77
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,333
You idiot.

78
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,833
I'll click your photo and
show it to the police.

79
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,958
Such a moron!

80
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,166
Are you hurt?

81
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:03,916
You okay?

82
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:08,250
Do you need a lift?
Can I help you in any way?

83
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:15,916
Stay right there.

84
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,083
Here's your coffee and sandwich.

85
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,750
Madam, I've had my breakfast.
I'm good.

86
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,041
I'm not.
I'm still in shock after that accident.

87
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:28,708
Why were you crossing the road alone?
You should get a guide dog.

88
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,291
I can't look after a dog.
I have a cat and she's a handful.

89
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,625
Have your coffee.

90
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,083
What if you were hurt?

91
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:37,750
End of a great artist's career
before it could even start.

92
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:41,333
-Artist? What do you do?
-I play the piano.

93
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,583
Do you play well?

94
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,208
-Hey, Baadshah.
-Yes, Sir?

95
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:52,541
You leave the storeroom door open
every night.

96
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:53,625
Sorry, I forgot.

97
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,708
Where have you brought me, Sophie?

98
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,750
Wow. Are you free in the evenings?

99
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,708
What's the problem with your eyes?

100
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:50,083
I got hit by a cricket ball
when I was 14.

101
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,250
Sorry?

102
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,000
A cricket ball hit my head
when I was 14.

103
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,708
The optic nerve was damaged.

104
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:04,041
The tips at Franco's won't even
cover your rickshaw fare home.

105
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,500
Here we are.

106
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,666
Prabhat road, lane four.

107
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:16,458
-What's this place?
-It belongs to an NGO for the handicapped.

108
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,916
I'm here for three months.
Guess how much rent I pay.

109
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:21,791
500 rupees a month.

110
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,916
I sense trees everywhere.

111
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,666
I wake up to a symphony of bird songs.

112
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,583
Okay.

113
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:30,791
-The stairs are here.
-Yes.

114
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:38,875
Right now I have tons to do.

115
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:57,375
I'll finish it today.

116
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,791
-It didn't seem unfinished.
-But, it is.

117
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:04,125
Some things are better unfinished.

118
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,208
Don't think too much. You'll spoil it.

119
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,208
I'll be down in two minutes.

120
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,125
Yes, there are a lot of birds here.

121
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,791
Are you completely blind?

122
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:23,291
No. I can sense darkness and light.

123
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:24,875
Shall I tell you the time?

124
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,166
I think it's about...

125
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:29,666
5:30 p.m.

126
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:48,916
I've seen a beautiful face just now

127
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:57,875
I'm not quite sure how to read it though

128
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:03,333
I feel as if it's like an ocean
And my heart has drowned in it

129
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:06,458
I was struck down
From that moment to this

130
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:10,375
You can't really blame my innocent eyes

131
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:14,041
You can't really blame my innocent eyes

132
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:18,000
You can't really blame my innocent eyes

133
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:21,750
O heart of mine, tell me

134
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:25,291
You can't really blame my innocent eyes

135
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:29,208
You can't really blame my innocent eyes

136
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,958
You can't really blame my innocent eyes

137
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:36,625
O heart of mine, tell me

138
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,666
He's going to be a big star!

139
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,791
You are gifted!

140
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,208
Not everyone is gifted.

141
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,791
Sir, your voice resembles
the actor Pramod Sinha's.

142
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:08,750
What?

143
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,041
Do you know him?

144
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,916
I saw one of his movies on TV
when I was a kid.

145
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,000
The name of the movie is Annadaata.

146
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,541
-The songs are terrific too.
-Amazing.

147
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:21,083
Come and give me a hug!

148
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,625
You've earned 4000 rupees as tips today.

149
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:36,875
I'm hoping to earn 2,00,000 rupees
so that I can go to London.

150
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:06,916
Akash?

151
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:11,000
-You are early.
-I need to practice.

152
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,958
I don't fall for someone that easily

153
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:37,083
But this time, my heart outdid me

154
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:43,250
What has come over me?

155
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:48,375
Sometimes the heart races away
Sometimes its beating quickens

156
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:52,583
My eyes experience an awakening
When something like this happens

157
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:57,583
What had to happen, has happened

158
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:05,375
When two hearts meet,
They fit like hand in glove

159
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,041
What are you looking at?

160
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:10,708
No burning lamp, no shining light

161
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:14,458
You can't really blame my innocent eyes

162
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:18,458
You can't really blame my innocent eyes

163
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:22,000
O heart of mine, tell me

164
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:25,791
You can't really blame my innocent eyes

165
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:29,750
You can't really blame my innocent eyes

166
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:33,625
You can't really blame my innocent eyes

167
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:37,750
O heart of mine, tell me

168
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:38,041
My darling

169
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,708
What's your name?

170
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:42,958
I see you with eyes closed

171
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:46,000
Your lover is waving out to you

172
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:47,708
What's your name?

173
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:50,958
I see you with eyes closed

174
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:54,833
My heart is pacing away, unbridled

175
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:58,750
My heart is pacing away, unbridled

176
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:02,166
Since Monday night, maybe

177
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:08,666
In my heart of hearts,
It's you that I find

178
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:16,125
In my heart of hearts,
It's you that I find

179
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:24,000
In my heart of hearts,
It's you that I find

180
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:46,583
-Can you play my songs as well?
-Sure. I'll just play them.

181
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:48,125
No, not here.

182
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,041
Come to my house tomorrow
for a private concert.

183
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:52,875
I'll be there along with my wife.

184
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:57,416
She loves the actor Rajesh Khanna.
Play his numbers. She'll be happy.

185
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,500
Here.

186
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:01,708
Here's my address.

187
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,375
And an advance. You'll get more later.

188
00:25:09,583 --> 00:25:10,666
One o'clock.

189
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:14,916
One o'clock?

190
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:42,333
Simi, watch this scene. It's great fun.

191
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:43,875
Look.

192
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:46,375
Pammi, I've seen it ten times.

193
00:25:46,583 --> 00:25:48,708
Now this bimbo will get murdered.

194
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:51,416
How many times have you seen it?
A thousand?

195
00:25:52,958 --> 00:25:54,500
I'm going to Bengaluru tomorrow.

196
00:25:55,208 --> 00:25:56,083
What?

197
00:25:57,166 --> 00:25:58,208
Have I upset you?

198
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,541
Tomorrow is our wedding anniversary.
You're going away?

199
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:04,000
Shetty had called.

200
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:07,791
There's something urgent.
I'll be back by evening.

201
00:26:18,666 --> 00:26:20,791
-The switch board is on your right.
-Thank you.

202
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:27,250
-Shall I close the door?
-Yes.

203
00:26:30,666 --> 00:26:32,541
Can you open this for me?

204
00:27:50,291 --> 00:27:52,333
Do you have a bottle opener?

205
00:27:55,666 --> 00:27:59,083
Cheers to the Pune rain.

206
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:07,458
Now it's your turn to say
something awesome.

207
00:28:11,458 --> 00:28:13,416
Cheers to Kishore Kumar.

208
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,791
-You win.
-What's this?

209
00:28:19,541 --> 00:28:21,416
An eye mask? Is it yours?

210
00:28:23,666 --> 00:28:28,666
Whenever I can't fall asleep
I use the mask to force my eyes shut.

211
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:34,208
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

212
00:28:34,291 --> 00:28:35,916
Why are you dropping things?

213
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:40,000
-I'm looking for my wine glass.
-It must be where you left it.

214
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:48,583
I thought I'd left it there.

215
00:28:49,458 --> 00:28:51,625
Careful. You'll break the glass.

216
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:54,916
Broken glass is a sign of good luck.

217
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,333
I've found your glass.

218
00:28:58,208 --> 00:28:59,541
Where is it?

219
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:06,041
You wore the eye mask.

220
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:09,041
Let's have breakfast at
the Law College canteen.

221
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:18,958
-There's no Oscar for your performance.
-I'm not lying.

222
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:29,083
Can you see me to the door?

223
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:10,291
-Pramod Sinha asked me to be here.
-My husband is not at home.

224
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,500
Mrs. Sinha.

225
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,375
-Here for the private concert.
-Private concert?

226
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:21,666
But he's gone to Bengaluru.
He'll be back by tomorrow.

227
00:31:24,291 --> 00:31:26,291
At one o'clock. Sorry, I'm early.

228
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:31,041
It was today, for sure.
He paid me an advance.

229
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,500
It was a surprise.

230
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,958
I shouldn't have told you.
You can call him and check.

231
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:40,041
Is that him?

232
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:45,708
Come inside.

233
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:58,916
I'll call Pramod.

234
00:32:03,666 --> 00:32:04,833
Pammi.

235
00:32:05,416 --> 00:32:08,250
Did you ask a musician to come home?

236
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:13,666
My God. You should've told me.

237
00:32:13,916 --> 00:32:15,708
I'm not even properly dressed.

238
00:32:16,458 --> 00:32:18,833
Okay. Come home soon.

239
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:24,916
He'll be here in ten minutes.

240
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:30,958
Are you completely...

241
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:33,583
blind?

242
00:32:36,916 --> 00:32:41,083
When I was 14, a cricket ball damaged
the optic nerve of my eyes.

243
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:45,875
In spite of that, you play music.

244
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,791
My hearing is absolutely fine.

245
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,625
He's still very romantic.

246
00:33:40,291 --> 00:33:42,583
Ma'am, may I use your bathroom?

247
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:53,166
Looks like Pramod is here.

248
00:39:55,333 --> 00:39:56,208
Hey!

249
00:39:57,708 --> 00:39:58,833
Pammi!

250
00:40:30,958 --> 00:40:33,333
You've made my day.

251
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:36,708
You should have your own show.
Shall I have a word with the TV producers?

252
00:40:36,791 --> 00:40:38,291
Pammi, let's go inside.

253
00:40:49,416 --> 00:40:50,708
Pammi, this is too much.

254
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:52,750
I'm really angry now.

255
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:56,583
You just got here. How can you go?

256
00:40:56,708 --> 00:40:57,875
Mad at me?

257
00:40:58,208 --> 00:41:02,000
Pammi, you could've taken the day off.

258
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:05,041
You'd better come home soon.

259
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:07,666
He's waiting for you.

260
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,166
He had to sign off a deal with a builder.

261
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,291
He says it's his lucky day.

262
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:24,666
Can I get you some fruit juice?

263
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:47,750
Pramod will be home late. You'd better go.

264
00:42:48,125 --> 00:42:50,250
Do I owe you anything?

265
00:42:50,875 --> 00:42:53,166
It's okay, ma'am. Sir will pay me.

266
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,250
Lottery tickets for sale. Try your luck.

267
00:43:10,916 --> 00:43:14,208
Lottery tickets for sale.
Try your luck, Sir.

268
00:43:14,666 --> 00:43:16,041
Go on, buy one.

269
00:43:17,625 --> 00:43:19,958
Sir, do me a favour.

270
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:24,500
Place your hand on any ticket.
They say, God favors the blind.

271
00:43:25,416 --> 00:43:28,375
He touched the ticket.

272
00:43:28,708 --> 00:43:30,541
You'll hit the jackpot now.

273
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:32,208
Out with a 100 rupees.

274
00:43:34,083 --> 00:43:38,250
-Want me to get you some tea, Sir?
-No. Get me an auto.

275
00:43:38,375 --> 00:43:39,875
Hey, get your auto out.

276
00:43:39,958 --> 00:43:41,541
Give him a ride.

277
00:43:42,541 --> 00:43:43,875
-Hurry up.
-Coming.

278
00:43:43,958 --> 00:43:45,125
Thank you, Sir.

279
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,041
-Where to?
-The police station.

280
00:43:56,125 --> 00:43:57,166
Where to?

281
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:01,083
Come this way.

282
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:04,958
Careful.

283
00:44:05,958 --> 00:44:07,708
Sir, he wants to file a complaint.

284
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,041
What complaint?

285
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,458
I want to report a murder.

286
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:16,000
Who was murdered?

287
00:44:22,875 --> 00:44:24,500
Some water, please.

288
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:32,791
Please relax. The boss is here.

289
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:35,583
So, who was murdered?

290
00:44:36,916 --> 00:44:40,541
-Rani, Sir.
-Rani? Who is Rani?

291
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:42,000
My cat.

292
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:45,583
The neighbourhood kid was after her.
He must be the culprit.

293
00:44:46,875 --> 00:44:49,583
You think we're crazy
to look for a cat's killer?

294
00:44:49,833 --> 00:44:50,958
Shut it.

295
00:44:52,666 --> 00:44:55,375
-Did you witness the murder?
-I'm blind, Sir.

296
00:44:56,083 --> 00:44:58,291
I'll find your cat.

297
00:44:59,125 --> 00:45:00,583
Back again?

298
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:07,625
-Where do you live?
-Prabhat road.

299
00:45:17,166 --> 00:45:20,250
Your phone is switched off.
I've been waiting since so long!

300
00:45:20,333 --> 00:45:22,000
I've been trying to reach you.

301
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:25,958
Couldn't you tell me you were busy, Manu?

302
00:45:26,208 --> 00:45:27,083
I love you, Sweetheart.

303
00:45:27,166 --> 00:45:28,458
I had a meeting.

304
00:45:29,708 --> 00:45:31,208
Always the same story.

305
00:45:31,333 --> 00:45:33,458
An urgent case has come up.
Sorry.

306
00:45:33,958 --> 00:45:35,583
Let's talk tonight.

307
00:45:37,375 --> 00:45:38,541
See you.

308
00:45:44,666 --> 00:45:46,458
What's so urgent?

309
00:45:46,708 --> 00:45:50,375
-He's looking for a cat.
-A cat?

310
00:45:50,625 --> 00:45:51,750
What color is your cat?

311
00:45:56,083 --> 00:45:57,250
How do you know?

312
00:45:58,708 --> 00:45:59,708
I was told.

313
00:46:21,166 --> 00:46:22,416
Rani.

314
00:46:24,458 --> 00:46:25,541
You cook for yourself?

315
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:27,625
Forget about me, Sir.
Look for Rani, please.

316
00:46:27,708 --> 00:46:29,250
Rani might get run over.

317
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:31,416
-Water.
-Chilled?

318
00:46:42,791 --> 00:46:43,708
Water.

319
00:46:59,125 --> 00:47:00,958
Today's newspaper? What for?

320
00:47:01,708 --> 00:47:03,708
To collect cat poo, Sir.

321
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:31,541
You're here?

322
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:35,000
Please look for Rani.
I'm lost without her.

323
00:47:35,875 --> 00:47:38,041
Sir, Bandu's school bus.

324
00:47:38,166 --> 00:47:40,125
Slap him hard to make him confess.

325
00:47:40,208 --> 00:47:44,041
Last week he tied a firecracker
to Rani's tail. She ran amok.

326
00:47:44,166 --> 00:47:45,958
She hid indoors for two days.

327
00:47:46,041 --> 00:47:47,375
That's no good.

328
00:47:52,083 --> 00:47:53,875
What was that?

329
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:55,083
Rani?

330
00:47:56,875 --> 00:47:57,916
Rani.

331
00:47:58,958 --> 00:48:00,166
Where were you?

332
00:48:00,625 --> 00:48:02,958
Come, baby. Eat something.

333
00:48:04,125 --> 00:48:05,708
You haven't eaten for two days.

334
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:17,625
Good girl.

335
00:48:34,166 --> 00:48:35,583
I'll call him.

336
00:48:43,625 --> 00:48:44,750
Sophie.

337
00:48:55,875 --> 00:48:57,875
The piano player is quite gifted.

338
00:48:58,333 --> 00:48:59,333
That's right.

339
00:49:07,833 --> 00:49:10,041
Ma'am, we've ordered the red velvet cake.

340
00:49:10,916 --> 00:49:13,125
-The one for diabetic patients?
-Yes. Don't worry.

341
00:50:04,083 --> 00:50:06,666
-Seen Akash?
-He just left in an auto.

342
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:21,666
I'll never return to see you again

343
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:25,083
Never ever

344
00:50:25,166 --> 00:50:29,375
Breaking news from Pune.
It is regarding the 1970s film star.

345
00:50:29,583 --> 00:50:32,250
Pramod Sinha was shot dead last night.

346
00:50:32,375 --> 00:50:36,166
His car was found
near the Indrayani river in Pune.

347
00:50:36,291 --> 00:50:38,916
His dead body was inside the car.

348
00:50:39,166 --> 00:50:42,375
Spy of Shanghai, Nurse Radha,
The Boy Next Door.

349
00:50:42,458 --> 00:50:44,916
After having worked in
many such super-hit films,

350
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,458
Pramod Sinha had retired
from acting in films.

351
00:50:48,791 --> 00:50:50,875
He joined the real estate business,
thereafter.

352
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,083
According to his wife, Simi Sinha,

353
00:50:53,166 --> 00:50:56,250
he left home with a
deep-purple colored suitcase

354
00:50:56,333 --> 00:51:00,166
containing one crore rupees of cash
to close a property deal.

355
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:02,000
But he never returned.

356
00:51:02,083 --> 00:51:06,000
The police is investigating the case.
Until now there has been no clue.

357
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:11,083
Despite the government's new rules,

358
00:51:11,208 --> 00:51:15,666
large cash transactions
are still the order of the day.

359
00:51:31,458 --> 00:51:33,500
I swear, I know nothing.

360
00:51:33,583 --> 00:51:36,708
-Where did you find the watch?
-In the men's toilet, Sir.

361
00:51:37,375 --> 00:51:40,541
I swear. I'm innocent.

362
00:51:40,666 --> 00:51:44,875
I know nothing, Sir. I swear!

363
00:51:48,375 --> 00:51:51,041
Are you sure this is Mr. Sinha's watch?

364
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:56,208
I gave it to Dad on his last birthday.

365
00:51:57,666 --> 00:51:58,541
Any progress?

366
00:51:58,708 --> 00:52:00,750
He'll reveal details soon enough.

367
00:52:05,791 --> 00:52:07,250
Sir, he's the piano player.

368
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:13,708
Who are you?

369
00:52:14,416 --> 00:52:15,750
I'm Daani.

370
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:18,541
Dad had told me about you.

371
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,500
He even sent me a photo.

372
00:52:21,833 --> 00:52:24,083
You were there when he was home
for the last time.

373
00:52:26,041 --> 00:52:27,291
Was he well?

374
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:29,291
He was.

375
00:52:31,083 --> 00:52:32,291
He was very happy.

376
00:52:34,458 --> 00:52:35,500
Kamdar.

377
00:52:37,083 --> 00:52:39,083
Read the statement out loud to Akash.
He'll sign it.

378
00:52:40,083 --> 00:52:43,208
Pramod Sinha had asked me to come over
to his house on the 27th of June 2017

379
00:52:43,333 --> 00:52:45,583
for a private concert
to mark his wedding anniversary.

380
00:52:45,666 --> 00:52:47,500
I was there sharp at one.

381
00:52:47,583 --> 00:52:49,500
Mr. Pramod came home ten minutes later.

382
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:53,458
We spoke briefly but he had to
rush away to meet a builder.

383
00:52:53,875 --> 00:52:54,833
That's a lie!

384
00:52:54,916 --> 00:52:57,250
They killed him
and stuffed his body in a bag.

385
00:52:57,333 --> 00:52:59,375
They even snapped his finger
to remove a ring.

386
00:52:59,458 --> 00:53:02,291
-Look at my eyes. I can see!
-Catch him.

387
00:53:02,375 --> 00:53:05,208
Daani, they're having an affair.
Don't trust them.

388
00:53:05,333 --> 00:53:08,791
-He's talking utter rubbish!
-Really? Better stop lying!

389
00:53:10,541 --> 00:53:14,041
I waited for a while
but he did not come back.

390
00:53:14,541 --> 00:53:18,666
At 2 p.m. Mrs. Sinha asked me to leave.

391
00:53:27,333 --> 00:53:30,000
May the days pass

392
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:33,166
May the seconds tick by

393
00:53:33,291 --> 00:53:35,833
May the days pass

394
00:53:36,125 --> 00:53:39,000
May the seconds tick by

395
00:53:39,333 --> 00:53:42,041
Lost in fond memories

396
00:53:42,291 --> 00:53:45,208
Lost in their words

397
00:53:45,291 --> 00:53:48,000
Reminiscing the times spent with them

398
00:53:48,125 --> 00:53:51,958
Since the day we met

399
00:53:52,208 --> 00:53:57,000
My dreams have been painted
With vibrant colours

400
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:59,625
May the days pass

401
00:54:11,666 --> 00:54:14,250
Pramod always used to say.

402
00:54:15,458 --> 00:54:19,958
Bury the past, think of the future.

403
00:54:21,041 --> 00:54:26,000
But today when I look ahead,
I see no future.

404
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,625
He left me all alone
on our wedding anniversary.

405
00:54:32,375 --> 00:54:35,083
He had asked Akash to come over
as part of my anniversary surprise.

406
00:54:35,166 --> 00:54:36,625
He came home late that day.

407
00:54:37,083 --> 00:54:40,125
He spoke to us briefly before he left.

408
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:44,416
Just as he was leaving,
here's what he said.

409
00:54:44,666 --> 00:54:45,875
"Simi...

410
00:54:46,666 --> 00:54:49,666
I'll be right back."

411
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:51,583
-Simi's speech was all a lie.
-Lie?

412
00:55:51,791 --> 00:55:53,625
Pramod was not late.

413
00:55:53,708 --> 00:55:55,500
I saw everything.

414
00:55:55,833 --> 00:55:57,666
A man showed up first.

415
00:55:57,875 --> 00:56:00,791
Then, Pramod reached home.

416
00:56:00,875 --> 00:56:04,833
The man was inside the house
when the piano player got there.

417
00:56:05,125 --> 00:56:07,458
-Who are you?
-Mrs. D'Sa.

418
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:12,208
I'm the principal of St. Annes
and Mr. Pramod's neighbour.

419
00:56:12,458 --> 00:56:16,458
Pramod and my husband
were close friends.

420
00:56:16,625 --> 00:56:20,458
They must be enjoying a drink together
in heaven.

421
00:56:22,416 --> 00:56:23,375
Go on.

422
00:56:23,958 --> 00:56:28,625
When I returned home from the post office,
a man was with me in the elevator.

423
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:30,791
He entered Pramod's house.

424
00:56:30,916 --> 00:56:34,583
When Pramod reached home with his gifts,
that man was in there too.

425
00:56:34,666 --> 00:56:35,583
Pramod was on time.

426
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:39,458
The blind piano player
was the last man to arrive.

427
00:56:40,125 --> 00:56:41,291
You've got it all wrong.

428
00:56:41,375 --> 00:56:44,791
The blind man had arrived
before Mr. Sinha.

429
00:56:45,125 --> 00:56:50,541
No. I'm telling you, there was
already a third man in the house.

430
00:56:50,916 --> 00:56:52,291
-A third man?
-Yes.

431
00:56:52,416 --> 00:56:53,541
Who?

432
00:56:54,208 --> 00:56:56,125
He resembled a body builder.

433
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:02,375
If I see him again, I'll
surely recognize him.

434
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:06,458
-Body builder? A third man?
-Yes.

435
00:57:06,916 --> 00:57:08,875
Ask Simi.

436
00:57:10,666 --> 00:57:15,291
She's over there. Ask her.
Make it sound casual.

437
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:16,708
Go on.

438
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:32,791
That was Dad's favourite song.

439
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:37,125
Will you teach me how to play it?

440
00:57:39,666 --> 00:57:41,375
A third man?

441
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:46,041
Last week? You mean,
the pizza delivery boy?

442
00:57:46,458 --> 00:57:49,708
He delivered the pizza
before Pramod got home.

443
00:57:50,458 --> 00:57:54,166
Actually, Mrs. D'Sa is trying to help.
She's a huge fan of Pramod.

444
00:57:56,333 --> 00:57:58,375
We're receiving too many crank calls, Sir.

445
00:57:58,791 --> 00:58:00,375
The last caller was unbelievable.

446
00:58:00,625 --> 00:58:03,083
He blamed Sir.

447
00:58:03,333 --> 00:58:06,500
He said that Sir murdered Mr. Sinha
and threw the body off the bridge.

448
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:07,666
Oh, no.

449
00:58:08,291 --> 00:58:09,875
What's wrong?

450
00:58:09,958 --> 00:58:10,875
Easy.

451
00:58:10,958 --> 00:58:11,833
You okay?

452
00:58:13,916 --> 00:58:17,083
People are just jealous of him.
Manu has many enemies.

453
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:21,500
I read in the papers that you
arrested a chap called Surya.

454
00:58:21,583 --> 00:58:24,875
He's not telling us
where he hid the money.

455
00:58:25,083 --> 00:58:26,583
But Sir will make sure he confesses.

456
00:58:27,916 --> 00:58:29,250
Sorry, but may I say something?

457
00:58:29,625 --> 00:58:32,458
Don't cross Simi off the list of suspects.

458
00:58:32,708 --> 00:58:35,500
After all, why did she marry an old man?

459
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:38,916
A love marriage with
such a huge age gap between the couple?

460
00:58:41,541 --> 00:58:42,666
Sure, he was rich.

461
00:58:42,958 --> 00:58:47,125
But she definitely has a lover.

462
00:58:47,666 --> 00:58:51,041
Yes! Mrs. D'Sa was implying that.

463
00:58:51,625 --> 00:58:54,958
-Mrs. D'Sa?
-Pramod Sinha's neighbour.

464
00:58:55,375 --> 00:58:58,708
She insists that a third man was present.

465
00:58:59,416 --> 00:59:02,375
-She says she can identify him.
-Get a sketch done.

466
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:07,208
Sinha's murder is a high profile case.

467
00:59:07,333 --> 00:59:10,166
Solve it and you will all get promoted.

468
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,625
-Let's call her to the police station.
-Best idea.

469
00:59:14,708 --> 00:59:17,458
She's a senior citizen.
We better go to her place.

470
00:59:18,458 --> 00:59:20,375
I'm going to the washroom.

471
00:59:20,958 --> 00:59:22,583
You haven't eaten the eggs.

472
00:59:24,791 --> 00:59:27,500
He eats sixteen eggs a day
as his protein intake.

473
00:59:41,208 --> 00:59:42,958
Any reason to this odd behaviour?

474
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:44,916
You left the restaurant abruptly that day.

475
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,291
Daani wants me to notate her dad's song.
Can we talk later?

476
00:59:51,375 --> 00:59:55,000
That night was not out of sympathy.
Nor was it casual.

477
00:59:55,416 --> 00:59:57,750
Was it for you? If so, tell me.

478
00:59:57,875 --> 01:00:00,000
This invisible tension doesn't suit me.

479
01:00:00,458 --> 01:00:02,083
It causes pimples.

480
01:00:04,125 --> 01:00:05,625
To Magarpatta.

481
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:10,583
Daani.

482
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:15,125
Can you buy me some pain balm
from the medical store, please?

483
01:00:39,375 --> 01:00:41,458
Do you have any medicine for headache?

484
01:00:41,958 --> 01:00:43,041
Yes, of course.

485
01:01:52,541 --> 01:01:54,208
-How about the water supply?
-It's constant.

486
01:01:54,291 --> 01:01:55,916
-The amenities?
-All good.

487
01:01:56,833 --> 01:02:00,458
She fell from the 7th floor.
We found her glasses there.

488
01:02:00,875 --> 01:02:04,166
She must have lost her balance.
The balcony floor was wet.

489
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:05,958
She was 81.

490
01:02:07,083 --> 01:02:09,333
-Isn't she the one we wanted to question?
-Yes, Sir.

491
01:02:12,041 --> 01:02:14,041
I've known Mrs. D'Sa since childhood.

492
01:02:15,458 --> 01:02:17,791
Make way. Move aside.

493
01:02:27,125 --> 01:02:29,791
What are you doing here?
We'll be late for the prayer meet.

494
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,291
Sophie, I have something urgent
to tell you.

495
01:03:21,583 --> 01:03:22,791
Come home soon.

496
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:39,958
Rani.

497
01:03:51,125 --> 01:03:53,041
Here.

498
01:04:11,791 --> 01:04:13,500
Can I come in?

499
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:15,875
Who is it? Mrs. Sinha?

500
01:04:17,416 --> 01:04:20,166
Daani was looking for you at the temple.
Where were you?

501
01:04:21,333 --> 01:04:22,500
Why?

502
01:04:24,333 --> 01:04:26,958
There was a prayer meet for Pramod.

503
01:04:27,541 --> 01:04:29,333
Didn't she tell you?

504
01:04:30,208 --> 01:04:32,791
Here, have the offerings.

505
01:04:36,458 --> 01:04:37,708
Please sit.

506
01:04:43,375 --> 01:04:45,375
I wanted to thank you personally.

507
01:04:46,541 --> 01:04:51,291
You've really helped Daani.
She's still in a state of shock.

508
01:04:53,833 --> 01:04:55,625
What can I get you? Coffee?

509
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:22,208
Black's good.

510
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:57,708
The coffee's great.

511
01:07:00,208 --> 01:07:03,375
Daani can practice here.

512
01:07:03,458 --> 01:07:06,208
There's a piano here.
It'll be more convenient.

513
01:07:18,166 --> 01:07:20,041
Drink up. The coffee will get cold.

514
01:07:20,416 --> 01:07:23,625
Ma'am, let me get some biscuits.

515
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:27,041
That's it. I just knew it!

516
01:07:29,125 --> 01:07:30,333
Stop pretending.

517
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:32,958
Take off those glasses.

518
01:08:03,875 --> 01:08:06,041
I don't want to get involved in all this.

519
01:08:06,333 --> 01:08:08,500
You should've sent me away
that day.

520
01:08:08,583 --> 01:08:10,083
I thought you were blind!

521
01:08:10,416 --> 01:08:12,958
And Mrs. D'Sa was watching us.

522
01:08:13,041 --> 01:08:14,208
She's dead now. Poor thing!

523
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:18,083
Why are you pretending to be blind?

524
01:08:19,333 --> 01:08:22,333
As a musician, I believe that
I play better when I don't see.

525
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:26,041
I had this crazy idea.

526
01:08:31,666 --> 01:08:34,291
How many people know
about this experiment?

527
01:08:35,458 --> 01:08:37,500
I swear to God, nobody knows about this.

528
01:08:37,583 --> 01:08:38,458
Trust me.

529
01:08:38,541 --> 01:08:40,041
I won't cause you trouble.

530
01:08:40,125 --> 01:08:41,541
I've already signed the statement.

531
01:08:41,625 --> 01:08:43,083
I'm leaving Pune for London.

532
01:08:45,791 --> 01:08:47,375
-I'll be gone soon.
-Sit down.

533
01:08:47,625 --> 01:08:49,083
Sit down, I say.

534
01:08:54,833 --> 01:08:56,291
Have you told Daani anything?

535
01:08:58,541 --> 01:08:59,833
Actually,

536
01:08:59,916 --> 01:09:01,250
Daani's father Pramod

537
01:09:01,333 --> 01:09:02,750
and I...

538
01:09:03,458 --> 01:09:04,833
were happy together.

539
01:09:11,833 --> 01:09:14,000
Pammi wanted to surprise me.

540
01:09:15,458 --> 01:09:16,791
But who ended up surprised?

541
01:09:17,041 --> 01:09:22,250
Everyone believes I'm blind.
So, I saw nothing.

542
01:09:22,333 --> 01:09:24,125
I saw nothing at all.

543
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:30,875
It's quite dirty here.

544
01:09:42,833 --> 01:09:43,833
What happened?

545
01:09:46,041 --> 01:09:48,041
What did you put in that offering?

546
01:09:49,916 --> 01:09:51,000
What did you feed me?

547
01:09:55,625 --> 01:09:56,708
What was in it?

548
01:11:01,958 --> 01:11:02,875
Hi, Ma'am.

549
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:06,041
Watch this video.
It will cost you 50 rupees.

550
01:11:06,125 --> 01:11:07,125
Get lost.

551
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:10,125
It's breaking news. You can pay me later.

552
01:11:10,208 --> 01:11:11,416
Please watch the video.

553
01:11:21,708 --> 01:11:22,708
My money?

554
01:11:23,541 --> 01:11:24,458
Ma'am.

555
01:11:26,666 --> 01:11:28,083
Akash!

556
01:12:09,666 --> 01:12:12,083
Akash.

557
01:12:12,791 --> 01:12:14,208
Akash.

558
01:12:15,958 --> 01:12:17,291
Akash!

559
01:12:27,291 --> 01:12:29,208
It's not what you think.

560
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:34,416
After Pramod died, I was very lonely.

561
01:12:35,625 --> 01:12:38,333
I came to rely on Akash.

562
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:42,166
-I'm sure you know that Akash is very...
-Sensitive?

563
01:12:42,708 --> 01:12:43,625
Yes.

564
01:12:44,166 --> 01:12:45,791
He is emotional.

565
01:12:50,291 --> 01:12:54,083
Did he tell you that he turned blind
when a ball hit him at the age of 14?

566
01:12:54,458 --> 01:12:55,333
Yes.

567
01:12:58,583 --> 01:13:00,250
He is not blind.

568
01:13:00,583 --> 01:13:01,958
What?

569
01:13:02,833 --> 01:13:04,333
-He's not blind?
-No way.

570
01:13:04,416 --> 01:13:06,833
-I just found out.
-How?

571
01:13:07,625 --> 01:13:09,458
Ask that kid downstairs.

572
01:13:11,541 --> 01:13:13,750
Ask him! Why ask me?

573
01:13:20,916 --> 01:13:22,458
Anyway.

574
01:13:23,041 --> 01:13:24,000
I better go.

575
01:13:31,583 --> 01:13:33,750
Give him a message from me.

576
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,750
Franco's has sold the piano.

577
01:13:51,083 --> 01:13:52,750
Ma'am, my money?

578
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,083
-What is it?
-What have you done to me?

579
01:15:34,791 --> 01:15:37,166
I can't see a thing. Nothing at all.

580
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:42,083
But you've been blind for years.

581
01:15:42,208 --> 01:15:45,000
I read an article about you
in the papers.

582
01:15:48,625 --> 01:15:52,458
How could anyone do such a thing?
It's wrong, it's evil!

583
01:15:53,083 --> 01:15:56,000
What did you put in my eyes?
Make them alright.

584
01:15:56,125 --> 01:15:59,541
Take me to a doctor at once!

585
01:15:59,875 --> 01:16:01,250
Or else, I'll tell everyone.

586
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:03,750
Sure, tell them.

587
01:16:03,875 --> 01:16:06,916
Tell the Press.
Give the police another statement.

588
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,291
Tell them that Simi Sinha murdered
Pramod Sinha and she blinded me.

589
01:16:10,958 --> 01:16:13,083
We'll see who believes you.

590
01:16:18,625 --> 01:16:22,375
I suggest you focus on your music.
You're an artist, after all.

591
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:43,083
What's on your phone?

592
01:16:43,250 --> 01:16:44,875
A video. Want to see it?

593
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:53,250
-Where is it?
-Look, it's here.

594
01:16:53,416 --> 01:16:55,333
It's gone!

595
01:16:56,666 --> 01:16:57,916
My money!

596
01:17:01,833 --> 01:17:03,333
I know you are not blind.

597
01:17:03,416 --> 01:17:07,375
Who else are you sleeping with
besides Simi Sinha?

598
01:17:07,541 --> 01:17:10,125
-Sophie, let me explain.
-Don't you dare call me again.

599
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:12,375
-If you do, I'll report you to the police.
-Sophie!

600
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:15,375
Now write a song about that.

601
01:18:00,375 --> 01:18:03,791
You blinded him? What do you mean?
How?

602
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:07,500
On the internet you can find
a hundred ways to do that.

603
01:18:07,916 --> 01:18:09,750
Good. Now he's really blind.

604
01:18:09,875 --> 01:18:12,333
But the blind can talk.
He can talk to the Press.

605
01:18:12,458 --> 01:18:15,083
If there's an inquiry, I'll get the boot.
We'll get caught.

606
01:18:15,208 --> 01:18:16,458
You should've killed him.

607
01:18:16,791 --> 01:18:19,583
I'm not a serial killer to
kill them off, one by one.

608
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:23,666
Keep playing the perfect husband.
Hide behind your wife.

609
01:18:24,166 --> 01:18:25,791
Why didn't you take my call?

610
01:18:25,875 --> 01:18:28,166
My wife's aunt was in the ICU.

611
01:18:28,708 --> 01:18:30,583
You know how it is. You were married too.

612
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:34,291
I was.
And to a far better man than you.

613
01:18:35,416 --> 01:18:37,875
Why did you bring your gun that day?

614
01:18:38,416 --> 01:18:40,500
If you hadn't,
none of this would've happened.

615
01:18:40,875 --> 01:18:43,666
He might have forgiven me.

616
01:18:44,250 --> 01:18:48,583
You think you're Dirty Harry,
while I do the dirty work!

617
01:20:20,208 --> 01:20:21,500
Open the door.

618
01:21:43,166 --> 01:21:45,666
Who is it?

619
01:21:46,208 --> 01:21:48,083
Don't touch me!

620
01:21:50,666 --> 01:21:52,750
I'm Dr. Swami. You're in my clinic.

621
01:21:52,875 --> 01:21:54,458
You were lying on the street.

622
01:21:54,541 --> 01:21:57,750
-Who brought me here?
-Me. Murli, the auto driver.

623
01:21:58,416 --> 01:22:01,833
We found your passport
and 6,000 rupees cash.

624
01:22:01,916 --> 01:22:03,958
-We've kept it aside safely.
-Yes.

625
01:22:04,541 --> 01:22:06,125
-Are you a doctor?
-Yes.

626
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:08,291
Sir, my eyes have been damaged.

627
01:22:08,375 --> 01:22:09,958
Please check my eyes.

628
01:22:10,041 --> 01:22:10,875
He is blind.

629
01:22:10,958 --> 01:22:13,750
-I can't see a thing. Check my eyes.
-Relax.

630
01:22:14,958 --> 01:22:16,583
They've been damaged recently.

631
01:22:16,958 --> 01:22:18,458
The cornea is damaged.

632
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:21,291
-An eye specialist can help you.
-Take me to him.

633
01:22:21,416 --> 01:22:23,833
-Take me to him.
-Take you where?

634
01:22:23,916 --> 01:22:26,000
Relax. You are already in a hospital.

635
01:22:26,083 --> 01:22:28,750
-Dr. Ambike will examine you.
-When does he come?

636
01:22:29,083 --> 01:22:30,958
At 7 in the evening.

637
01:22:32,166 --> 01:22:34,625
Let me give you a tetanus shot.

638
01:22:34,791 --> 01:22:37,375
Stretch your hand out. Clench your wrist.
Thumb inside.

639
01:22:37,458 --> 01:22:38,541
Good.

640
01:22:57,916 --> 01:23:03,416
Murli, when you picked me up,
was anyone else there?

641
01:23:03,541 --> 01:23:04,833
No. Why?

642
01:23:06,625 --> 01:23:08,291
Someone wants to kill me.

643
01:23:08,833 --> 01:23:10,291
Is there a problem?

644
01:23:10,375 --> 01:23:13,583
I dropped you at the police station
the other day.

645
01:23:22,833 --> 01:23:24,000
Please eat.

646
01:23:25,625 --> 01:23:26,500
Sir.

647
01:23:27,458 --> 01:23:29,166
I've met you before.

648
01:23:29,250 --> 01:23:33,208
You had helped me sell a lottery ticket.

649
01:23:33,708 --> 01:23:35,791
-Near the tea stall on MG road?
-Yes, Sir.

650
01:23:36,666 --> 01:23:38,708
You bring good luck.

651
01:23:39,083 --> 01:23:41,625
The ticket buyer won 10,000 rupees
that day.

652
01:23:42,916 --> 01:23:44,958
-What's the number?
-Number?

653
01:23:45,416 --> 01:23:49,166
-Don't you want to call someone?
-No.

654
01:23:52,041 --> 01:23:54,000
Don't you have a family?

655
01:23:55,166 --> 01:23:57,541
A friend, girlfriend, boyfriend?
You must have someone.

656
01:23:57,625 --> 01:24:00,291
-Someone to help you.
-There's no one!

657
01:24:02,125 --> 01:24:03,625
Let me know when the doctor is here.

658
01:24:05,333 --> 01:24:06,166
Alright.

659
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:10,416
Here's what you need to do.
Take this pill.

660
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,791
Take it after you've eaten.

661
01:24:13,125 --> 01:24:14,333
And get some sleep.

662
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:31,541
-Fetch my things from the car.
-Okay.

663
01:24:33,250 --> 01:24:34,833
1,50,000. Done.

664
01:24:35,291 --> 01:24:36,666
50,000 advance.

665
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:41,916
2,00,000 or I'll call it off.

666
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,666
Oh, come on.

667
01:24:44,291 --> 01:24:46,000
That blind fellow is of no use to you.

668
01:24:46,083 --> 01:24:47,375
The price is fair.

669
01:24:48,125 --> 01:24:50,541
Okay. Let's settle on two.

670
01:24:50,625 --> 01:24:52,958
50,000 advance. But, for both his kidneys.

671
01:24:53,916 --> 01:24:55,083
Done.

672
01:24:56,625 --> 01:24:58,541
Both kidneys? He'll die.

673
01:24:58,708 --> 01:24:59,916
So what?

674
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:03,250
We can leave his body
on the railway tracks.

675
01:25:03,833 --> 01:25:07,000
A few trains will run over him,
he'll be completely mutilated.

676
01:25:08,750 --> 01:25:10,750
I'm going to see the patient now.

677
01:25:11,750 --> 01:25:13,541
Are you okay with this?

678
01:25:13,625 --> 01:25:16,666
Were you okay with me
begging in the train?

679
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:17,583
Come on, now.

680
01:25:17,666 --> 01:25:19,958
We are getting 2,00,000
because he is in good health.

681
01:25:20,041 --> 01:25:21,750
Be quick. Why are you so concerned?

682
01:25:21,833 --> 01:25:24,500
Leave the poor man one kidney. He'll live.
Don't be a grave sinner.

683
01:25:26,166 --> 01:25:27,125
Akash.

684
01:25:27,375 --> 01:25:29,458
Doctor, is the eye specialist here?

685
01:25:29,583 --> 01:25:33,041
He'll be here soon.
Meanwhile, we'll scan your body.

686
01:25:36,875 --> 01:25:38,666
Turn to your left.

687
01:25:40,333 --> 01:25:42,000
Sit down. Put the light on.

688
01:25:42,291 --> 01:25:44,333
Sir, why is there no one
in your hospital?

689
01:25:44,458 --> 01:25:47,291
Am I the only patient here?
The hospital is quite deserted.

690
01:25:47,416 --> 01:25:49,958
This place is history now.

691
01:25:50,041 --> 01:25:52,916
There's a new hospital near the highway.
Everyone goes there.

692
01:25:58,750 --> 01:26:00,125
Take your t-shirt off.

693
01:26:04,541 --> 01:26:06,000
And your watch.

694
01:26:07,125 --> 01:26:08,583
Loosen your trousers.

695
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:11,041
Lie down.

696
01:26:15,666 --> 01:26:18,541
Lie down on your stomach. Good.

697
01:26:18,666 --> 01:26:19,958
Loosen your trousers.

698
01:26:22,458 --> 01:26:23,333
That's it.

699
01:26:25,333 --> 01:26:26,666
Well done.

700
01:26:34,958 --> 01:26:37,291
You are disturbing me.
Yes, I cut the cable connection.

701
01:26:37,375 --> 01:26:40,333
No TV until our son's exams are over.
No more drama series for you either.

702
01:26:40,541 --> 01:26:42,125
Help him prepare for his exams.

703
01:26:42,250 --> 01:26:45,000
I've told you not to disturb me
during an operation.

704
01:26:45,083 --> 01:26:46,791
I'll call you after the operation.

705
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,250
What operation? What for?

706
01:26:49,333 --> 01:26:52,291
-Relax. Just lie down.
-Where is Dr. Ambike?

707
01:26:52,375 --> 01:26:54,833
-What operation?
-Just lie down. Relax!

708
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:58,166
Take only one kidney out.
That should suffice.

709
01:26:58,291 --> 01:26:59,625
One kidney is enough, Sir.

710
01:26:59,708 --> 01:27:01,708
Hold him down!

711
01:27:03,583 --> 01:27:06,833
-Come here, fast.
-He's kicking like a horse.

712
01:27:06,958 --> 01:27:09,875
-1,00,000 is enough.
-Get off me!

713
01:27:10,083 --> 01:27:14,291
-1,00,000 is enough.
-I'll give you one crore!

714
01:27:14,375 --> 01:27:16,916
I swear by the Lord Shiva tattoo
on your hand!

715
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:20,041
I swear by the Lord Shiva tattoo
on your hand.

716
01:27:20,208 --> 01:27:21,541
Lord Shiva.

717
01:27:22,333 --> 01:27:23,666
I'll give you one crore.

718
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:26,708
The Lord Shiva tattoo on your hand...

719
01:27:27,291 --> 01:27:29,291
The tattoo...

720
01:27:30,166 --> 01:27:31,750
One crore...

721
01:27:32,916 --> 01:27:34,541
Lord Shiva.

722
01:27:36,041 --> 01:27:37,666
One crore?

723
01:28:00,041 --> 01:28:01,541
One crore!

724
01:28:02,958 --> 01:28:04,041
Wait!

725
01:28:06,250 --> 01:28:10,541
Doctor, how does he know
I have a Lord Shiva tattoo?

726
01:28:11,208 --> 01:28:14,916
Hail, Lord Shiva

727
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:19,208
You are the mightiest of them all

728
01:28:19,333 --> 01:28:24,875
Hail, Lord Shiva
You are the mightiest of them all

729
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,750
Hello, Mr. Akash.

730
01:28:30,083 --> 01:28:30,958
Sir.

731
01:28:31,041 --> 01:28:32,625
Get up.

732
01:28:32,875 --> 01:28:34,875
-Sir.
-Relax.

733
01:28:35,875 --> 01:28:38,208
Everything is all right, Sir.

734
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:39,791
No! Sir!

735
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:45,041
-No harm has come to you.
-Relax. Everything is fine.

736
01:28:50,291 --> 01:28:52,125
Everything is alright, Sir.

737
01:28:52,750 --> 01:28:54,625
You're very lucky.

738
01:28:55,416 --> 01:28:58,125
The doctor was planning to
remove both your kidneys.

739
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:00,791
We were about to get
2,00,000 rupees as payment.

740
01:29:03,541 --> 01:29:07,500
Then you started blabbering
about one crore rupees.

741
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:14,625
How do you know I have a Lord Shiva tattoo
on my forearm?

742
01:29:15,666 --> 01:29:18,916
You wear sarees, right?
You have black hair.

743
01:29:19,125 --> 01:29:21,500
You look like the athlete PT Usha.

744
01:29:22,666 --> 01:29:25,250
Murli, you are younger than her.

745
01:29:26,708 --> 01:29:28,375
She is taller than you.

746
01:29:29,291 --> 01:29:31,666
You've got hair like Malinga,
the fast bowler.

747
01:29:32,458 --> 01:29:34,500
-You are a fan of Aishwarya Rai.
-Yes.

748
01:29:34,583 --> 01:29:35,916
There's a poster on your rickshaw.

749
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:36,958
Yes, indeed.

750
01:29:37,041 --> 01:29:39,708
Oh my God. He has a third eye.

751
01:29:39,958 --> 01:29:42,833
Murli, he's a reincarnation of Lord Shiva.

752
01:29:43,291 --> 01:29:45,625
Hold on.

753
01:29:46,458 --> 01:29:49,041
Are you pretending to be blind?

754
01:29:49,833 --> 01:29:51,625
-Ma'am.
-Yes, Sir?

755
01:29:53,125 --> 01:29:55,458
I'm the biggest jackpot you'll ever win.

756
01:29:56,875 --> 01:29:58,208
What do you mean?

757
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:25,083
Can I check Mr. Sinha's call data?

758
01:30:26,541 --> 01:30:27,791
-Take a seat.
-Thank you, Ma'am.

759
01:30:27,916 --> 01:30:29,250
-You may leave.
-Okay.

760
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:36,791
How did you get hurt?

761
01:30:37,458 --> 01:30:38,875
A terrorist encounter.

762
01:30:42,041 --> 01:30:43,750
It must hurt a lot.

763
01:30:44,208 --> 01:30:48,166
Not really. Akash escaped.
We're tracking him.

764
01:30:49,041 --> 01:30:52,083
We've tapped his girlfriend's phone.

765
01:30:57,041 --> 01:30:58,833
Everything belongs to you now.

766
01:30:59,166 --> 01:31:01,208
The blind can talk, you know.

767
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:04,625
Find him!

768
01:31:28,875 --> 01:31:30,041
Mrs. Sinha.

769
01:31:31,250 --> 01:31:32,541
I'm going to London tomorrow.

770
01:31:33,666 --> 01:31:36,000
I wanted to meet Daani before I left.

771
01:31:41,458 --> 01:31:44,916
-Alright. Goodbye.
-Can I drop you somewhere?

772
01:31:45,791 --> 01:31:46,833
Sure.

773
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:51,625
Would you like some Chinese take-away?

774
01:32:07,833 --> 01:32:10,541
Akash is in my car. What now?

775
01:32:10,666 --> 01:32:14,250
Bring him to Range Hills.
I'll kill him right there.

776
01:32:16,375 --> 01:32:19,791
My wife's aunt is in the ICU again.
Got to rush.

777
01:32:22,916 --> 01:32:24,083
Tell me.

778
01:32:25,250 --> 01:32:27,291
I told you I was about to leave Pune.

779
01:32:28,750 --> 01:32:30,583
You still chose to blind me.

780
01:32:31,541 --> 01:32:33,583
And that boyfriend of yours!

781
01:32:33,791 --> 01:32:35,291
He was trying to get me.

782
01:32:36,541 --> 01:32:39,125
I've been sleeping at the bus stand
for the past two nights.

783
01:32:39,583 --> 01:32:42,666
-Did Manohar attack you?
-So, you don't know.

784
01:32:44,833 --> 01:32:46,916
I want my eyesight back.

785
01:32:48,916 --> 01:32:53,291
The doctor said that I could regain
my sight with a cornea transplant.

786
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:56,208
It will cost me a million
on the black market.

787
01:32:57,708 --> 01:32:58,750
Give me the money.

788
01:32:58,875 --> 01:33:01,083
I'll get the operation done
and leave for London.

789
01:33:06,958 --> 01:33:08,541
Get what I'm saying?

790
01:33:16,458 --> 01:33:19,458
A million. Or you'll be behind bars.

791
01:33:21,041 --> 01:33:22,625
I'll tell everything to the Press.

792
01:33:29,291 --> 01:33:33,125
I don't have that kind of money.
Besides, why would I give it to you?

793
01:33:47,166 --> 01:33:49,375
Move. You're holding us up.

794
01:33:50,083 --> 01:33:51,208
What is it?

795
01:33:51,958 --> 01:33:53,708
An auto rickshaw is blocking the way.

796
01:33:54,291 --> 01:33:56,583
Does it have an image of Aishwarya Rai?

797
01:33:59,208 --> 01:34:00,625
You can see again?

798
01:34:37,250 --> 01:34:40,291
I made some rice flakes, Chinese style.
Tell me if they're good.

799
01:34:42,375 --> 01:34:44,666
Who gave this to you?

800
01:34:45,958 --> 01:34:47,041
What's the matter?

801
01:34:48,166 --> 01:34:49,333
Not feeling well?

802
01:34:49,666 --> 01:34:50,791
Does it hurt?

803
01:34:52,750 --> 01:34:54,125
Eat. I'll get it.

804
01:34:54,250 --> 01:34:55,875
How does it taste?

805
01:35:05,041 --> 01:35:06,666
Private detective Ismail speaking.

806
01:35:06,791 --> 01:35:09,083
-Can I talk to Mrs. Rasika?
-I'm Rasika.

807
01:35:09,333 --> 01:35:14,041
The actor Pramod Sinha had hired me.

808
01:35:14,166 --> 01:35:16,708
He had a doubt that his
wife was having an affair.

809
01:35:16,791 --> 01:35:17,666
Manu.

810
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:20,541
I tailed her for two weeks.
Filmed her, took photos.

811
01:35:20,875 --> 01:35:24,833
Pramod Sinha has died.
So, who pays my fees now?

812
01:35:24,916 --> 01:35:27,875
It's not my problem. How am I concerned?

813
01:35:27,958 --> 01:35:30,458
Your husband is having
an affair with his wife.

814
01:35:30,541 --> 01:35:31,916
That's why.

815
01:35:32,041 --> 01:35:33,125
Who is it?

816
01:35:34,791 --> 01:35:35,666
Mallika.

817
01:35:40,916 --> 01:35:42,750
Do you know who my husband is?

818
01:35:43,041 --> 01:35:45,625
-If he finds out--
-I know who he is.

819
01:35:46,166 --> 01:35:51,791
But you don't know that he killed
Pramod Sinha for one crore rupees.

820
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:55,458
I'll call you at at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow.

821
01:35:55,958 --> 01:35:57,791
I want one crore rupees.

822
01:35:58,250 --> 01:36:01,375
Otherwise, I'll approach the media.
They pay a hefty sum for such stories.

823
01:36:05,875 --> 01:36:07,000
Good night.

824
01:36:09,208 --> 01:36:13,333
Well done, my man! Time for a selfie.

825
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:20,625
You'll hurt me!

826
01:36:20,708 --> 01:36:22,666
Come out! You dog!

827
01:36:23,041 --> 01:36:26,000
Come out or I'll kill you!

828
01:36:26,083 --> 01:36:28,166
That's a real gun!

829
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:30,458
I'll kill you, I swear!

830
01:36:30,750 --> 01:36:33,208
16 eggs a day, to go please her?

831
01:36:33,625 --> 01:36:37,416
To enjoy your time with
that cheap actress Simi!

832
01:36:37,541 --> 01:36:39,333
I'm a fool. I'm not smart enough.

833
01:36:39,416 --> 01:36:40,958
She's shrewd. I hate her.

834
01:36:41,250 --> 01:36:42,333
She trapped me.

835
01:36:42,458 --> 01:36:45,500
Are you a kid?
Didn't you realize she was trapping you?

836
01:36:45,583 --> 01:36:47,208
Honey, let's not talk about her.

837
01:36:47,291 --> 01:36:49,541
I messed up, big time.

838
01:36:49,625 --> 01:36:51,916
There's only one person I love.

839
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,541
And that's you.

840
01:36:55,583 --> 01:36:59,083
Shut up! I'm dead to you!

841
01:36:59,208 --> 01:37:00,083
Don't say that.

842
01:37:01,458 --> 01:37:03,958
-I'm sorry.
-You lowlife! Come out!

843
01:37:04,291 --> 01:37:05,500
Come out!

844
01:37:07,416 --> 01:37:11,416
I'm coming out now. Okay, Russu?

845
01:37:12,541 --> 01:37:13,791
Don't shoot.

846
01:37:17,333 --> 01:37:19,750
That's her again!

847
01:37:19,833 --> 01:37:24,833
No, it's the sub-inspector.
Let me take the call.

848
01:37:24,958 --> 01:37:27,458
Don't shoot. I'll put it on speaker.

849
01:37:27,750 --> 01:37:28,791
Yes, Paresh?

850
01:37:28,916 --> 01:37:32,916
Sir, we've found Simi Sinha's car
at Suicide Point.

851
01:37:33,333 --> 01:37:35,416
We found her bag and a shoe, near the car.

852
01:37:36,416 --> 01:37:38,416
I think she jumped off
and killed herself, Sir.

853
01:37:38,666 --> 01:37:40,958
We haven't found a suicide note.

854
01:37:41,125 --> 01:37:45,583
We are searching the river.
But, it is full of crocodiles.

855
01:37:55,083 --> 01:37:58,000
Simi Sinha, the widow
of actor Pramod Sinha

856
01:37:58,083 --> 01:37:59,333
has committed suicide.

857
01:37:59,416 --> 01:38:03,666
I'm standing on Pune's Indrayani bridge
where a bag and a shoe

858
01:38:03,791 --> 01:38:06,833
were found near Mrs. Sinha's car.

859
01:38:06,958 --> 01:38:11,500
Pramod Sinha's body was also
discovered nearby, a few days ago.

860
01:38:11,625 --> 01:38:15,000
The police believes that Mrs. Simi Sinha

861
01:38:15,083 --> 01:38:17,625
jumped over this bridge
and killed herself.

862
01:38:17,708 --> 01:38:22,000
Simi's step-daughter, Daani, told media

863
01:38:22,125 --> 01:38:26,291
that she last saw Simi leave home
with her piano teacher Akash.

864
01:38:26,416 --> 01:38:29,791
At this point, Akash's whereabouts
are unknown.

865
01:38:29,875 --> 01:38:31,208
They've eloped.

866
01:38:40,791 --> 01:38:42,958
Simi Sinha wanted to make it big
in the field of acting.

867
01:38:43,041 --> 01:38:48,458
And to achieve this, she married
the much older actor Pramod Sinha.

868
01:38:48,541 --> 01:38:50,041
After Pramod Sinha died,

869
01:38:50,125 --> 01:38:54,125
Simi's dream of becoming
a successful movie star, failed.

870
01:38:54,208 --> 01:39:00,166
This failure was probably
the reason behind her suicide.

871
01:39:00,416 --> 01:39:04,958
Pramod Sinha's murder mystery
has not been solved yet. And now--

872
01:39:15,083 --> 01:39:17,541
Crying over your own death, Mrs. Sinha?

873
01:39:29,291 --> 01:39:30,333
He's a doctor.

874
01:39:30,500 --> 01:39:32,250
He needs your blood sample.

875
01:39:32,625 --> 01:39:36,250
If your blood sample matches mine,
he'll use your cornea for the transplant.

876
01:39:45,875 --> 01:39:48,041
Want to save your eyes?

877
01:39:48,833 --> 01:39:50,916
Tell me where you've kept
the cash worth one crore.

878
01:39:55,208 --> 01:39:56,416
What's your name?

879
01:39:57,791 --> 01:39:59,375
Swami.

880
01:39:59,750 --> 01:40:02,000
Okay, Dr. Swami.

881
01:40:02,458 --> 01:40:03,416
Doctor, please.

882
01:40:03,875 --> 01:40:07,041
Believe him and you'll be in trouble.
The police is looking for him.

883
01:40:07,250 --> 01:40:11,333
You want money. I'll give it to you.
Just untie me.

884
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:13,458
Madam, no one believes you.

885
01:40:13,708 --> 01:40:16,666
You're evil. You murdered your husband.

886
01:40:17,291 --> 01:40:21,791
-I didn't kill Pramod.
-I saw it!

887
01:40:22,083 --> 01:40:25,500
You helped Manohar stuff
Mr. Sinha's body in a suitcase.

888
01:40:25,625 --> 01:40:27,625
You got it all wrong.
You had arrived later.

889
01:40:27,958 --> 01:40:31,000
That stupid Pammi had lied to
me about going to Bengaluru.

890
01:40:31,083 --> 01:40:32,416
He came home to surprise me.

891
01:40:32,833 --> 01:40:34,916
Pramod picked up Manohar's gun.

892
01:40:35,041 --> 01:40:37,458
I was explaining things when
the gun went off by accident!

893
01:40:38,458 --> 01:40:39,833
And Mrs. D'Sa?

894
01:40:41,375 --> 01:40:43,708
Are you a bunch of saints?

895
01:40:43,958 --> 01:40:47,666
Yes, I pushed her off the building.
What if she identified Manohar?

896
01:40:49,416 --> 01:40:54,083
Yes, I pushed her off the building.
What if she identified Manohar?

897
01:41:01,916 --> 01:41:04,333
If we don't get paid,
your confession ends up

898
01:41:04,458 --> 01:41:07,166
with the Press, the police
and Pramod Sinha's daughter Daani.

899
01:41:09,791 --> 01:41:11,375
Manohar was right.

900
01:41:12,333 --> 01:41:16,583
I shouldn't have blinded you.
I should've killed you.

901
01:41:16,958 --> 01:41:18,083
Untie me!

902
01:41:19,291 --> 01:41:20,916
Are you mad?

903
01:41:21,791 --> 01:41:24,000
If we untie the blindfold,
you will see us.

904
01:41:24,291 --> 01:41:25,833
We'd have to kill you, then.

905
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,750
Stay calm and cooperate.

906
01:41:27,916 --> 01:41:29,958
I'll get you breakfast and
take you to the toilet.

907
01:41:37,666 --> 01:41:39,791
Stop. This is the top floor.

908
01:41:40,250 --> 01:41:42,916
Murli, you'll stay here.
What about you, Ma'am?

909
01:41:43,208 --> 01:41:47,625
I'll wait downstairs.
If anyone asks, I'll say I'm the cleaner.

910
01:41:47,708 --> 01:41:48,833
-Right?
-Yes.

911
01:41:49,250 --> 01:41:53,666
-We have to trap him in the elevator.
-That's when I'll switch the power off.

912
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,541
The tiger will be trapped in his cage.
The monkeys will be on a rampage.

913
01:41:57,625 --> 01:42:01,125
-Let's shake on it.
-There goes the building.

914
01:42:03,125 --> 01:42:05,208
I want to hear Manohar scream.

915
01:42:06,916 --> 01:42:08,416
Record him on your mobile.

916
01:42:10,541 --> 01:42:13,208
She drinks gallons of coconut water
and just keeps peeing.

917
01:42:14,125 --> 01:42:16,916
Does Dr. Ambike even exist?

918
01:42:18,041 --> 01:42:21,583
There must be a hundred
Dr. Ambikes in Pune.

919
01:42:23,291 --> 01:42:24,625
What's so funny?

920
01:42:28,291 --> 01:42:33,250
How many times must I tell you?
There is no missing money. Trust me.

921
01:42:33,916 --> 01:42:37,416
We saw you on the news stating that
there's missing money involved.

922
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:39,708
If it's on TV, doesn't mean it's true.

923
01:42:41,250 --> 01:42:44,666
Ma'am. I am a widow.

924
01:42:45,666 --> 01:42:50,083
My daughter is all alone at home.
Help me, please.

925
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,208
Once we get one crore rupees,

926
01:42:53,791 --> 01:42:56,041
we'll see.

927
01:42:58,166 --> 01:42:59,916
Help!

928
01:43:00,750 --> 01:43:03,583
Help!

929
01:43:03,958 --> 01:43:06,916
Help!

930
01:43:07,708 --> 01:43:09,708
Help!

931
01:43:10,791 --> 01:43:12,791
Help!

932
01:43:13,958 --> 01:43:16,625
Help! Someone, help me!

933
01:43:19,875 --> 01:43:23,500
The next train arrives in an hour.
Try again.

934
01:43:38,083 --> 01:43:41,208
What use is courage, or a heart?

935
01:43:41,291 --> 01:43:45,166
The kidneys are the dearest part

936
01:43:49,333 --> 01:43:52,750
What use is courage, or a heart?

937
01:43:52,833 --> 01:43:56,541
The kidneys are the dearest part

938
01:43:57,083 --> 01:44:00,333
Enmity comes free

939
01:44:00,416 --> 01:44:03,791
Friendship charges a fee

940
01:44:04,375 --> 01:44:09,000
Friendship charges a fee

941
01:44:10,166 --> 01:44:13,166
Oh, dear

942
01:44:13,250 --> 01:44:17,125
Why does the heart
Feel more like a black hole?

943
01:44:17,666 --> 01:44:20,583
Oh, dear

944
01:44:20,666 --> 01:44:24,958
Why does the heart
Feel more like a black hole?

945
01:44:25,083 --> 01:44:28,125
Oh, dear

946
01:44:28,208 --> 01:44:32,458
Why does the heart
Feel more like a black hole?

947
01:44:32,541 --> 01:44:35,541
Oh, dear

948
01:44:35,625 --> 01:44:40,208
Why does the heart
Feel more like a black hole?

949
01:44:40,291 --> 01:44:43,125
Oh, dear

950
01:44:43,208 --> 01:44:46,458
Why does the heart
Feel more like a black hole?

951
01:44:47,666 --> 01:44:50,583
Oh, dear

952
01:44:50,708 --> 01:44:55,166
Why does the heart
Feel more like a black hole?

953
01:45:03,958 --> 01:45:05,375
Mrs. Manohar?

954
01:45:05,458 --> 01:45:08,750
Mrs. Ismail here. Is the money ready?

955
01:45:09,083 --> 01:45:11,416
Yes. Where shall I bring it?

956
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:15,125
Not you. Send your husband.

957
01:45:15,583 --> 01:45:18,666
I'll text him the address. Bye.

958
01:45:25,208 --> 01:45:29,250
Go and clean up the mess you made.

959
01:45:40,750 --> 01:45:42,166
Come on.

960
01:45:44,041 --> 01:45:45,291
Careful.

961
01:45:48,625 --> 01:45:52,041
As a cop, he's quite smart.
Don't take a chance. Do as I told you.

962
01:45:52,333 --> 01:45:53,416
Alright.

963
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,791
Sit down.

964
01:46:03,875 --> 01:46:05,916
Why are you tying me up?

965
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:09,708
Easy! It's for your own good.

966
01:46:09,833 --> 01:46:11,666
Murli, why are you doing this?

967
01:46:12,166 --> 01:46:15,250
There's a lot of junk in here.
You might hurt yourself.

968
01:46:15,333 --> 01:46:19,416
I'm not crazy to escape. I trusted you!

969
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,666
I don't know what you're up to.

970
01:46:23,625 --> 01:46:24,958
Untie me.

971
01:46:30,333 --> 01:46:32,333
Let's go. Be quick.

972
01:46:34,125 --> 01:46:36,000
How can you do this?

973
01:46:36,333 --> 01:46:38,708
Murli! Ma'am!

974
01:46:46,125 --> 01:46:50,333
The monkeys have tied up their master
and scooted.

975
01:46:51,333 --> 01:46:56,791
So you really think they'll return
with Manohar's money?

976
01:46:59,208 --> 01:47:02,791
Manohar is going to whip your motley gang.

977
01:47:03,250 --> 01:47:05,125
He'll whip you too.

978
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:10,250
Cat got your tongue?

979
01:47:12,916 --> 01:47:14,458
Just wondering.

980
01:47:15,833 --> 01:47:18,125
What will Manohar do to you?

981
01:47:18,916 --> 01:47:20,916
Will he hug you? Or shoot you?

982
01:47:22,125 --> 01:47:24,458
You're a liability now.

983
01:47:31,125 --> 01:47:33,583
Why are you quiet?

984
01:47:42,500 --> 01:47:46,041
-Akash, come closer.
-Why?

985
01:47:48,541 --> 01:47:50,625
Because...

986
01:47:52,541 --> 01:47:54,375
we have to help each other.

987
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:57,416
I can untie your hands.

988
01:47:57,875 --> 01:47:59,250
And, in return?

989
01:47:59,791 --> 01:48:02,375
In return,
you can take the blindfold off my eyes.

990
01:48:02,500 --> 01:48:03,541
I don't want your help.

991
01:48:05,333 --> 01:48:07,333
You fool, what's your plan?

992
01:48:07,833 --> 01:48:09,791
Prefer waiting here for the end?

993
01:48:10,083 --> 01:48:11,625
When Manohar shows up,

994
01:48:12,125 --> 01:48:15,333
I'll find a way to save my skin.
But you are definitely doomed.

995
01:48:16,833 --> 01:48:17,958
Where are you?

996
01:48:25,541 --> 01:48:26,375
Akash.

997
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:30,583
Our meeting was a dream

998
01:48:32,208 --> 01:48:36,125
You got what you wanted

999
01:48:36,208 --> 01:48:38,458
Is that the only song you can think of?

1000
01:48:39,250 --> 01:48:43,208
I'll never return to see you again

1001
01:48:44,541 --> 01:48:46,541
Never ever

1002
01:48:49,583 --> 01:48:51,583
-Hey.
-Yes.

1003
01:48:57,916 --> 01:48:59,125
Listen.

1004
01:49:00,291 --> 01:49:02,666
Even if Manohar arranges the money

1005
01:49:02,916 --> 01:49:06,125
I don't think they'll let us go.
What do you think?

1006
01:49:06,750 --> 01:49:10,708
Murli is more trustworthy than the lady.
The doctor is the dangerous one.

1007
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:14,000
I cut the cable connection.
Next, I'm selling the TV.

1008
01:49:14,125 --> 01:49:16,166
Mummy and I will be
staying with grandma.

1009
01:49:16,291 --> 01:49:19,291
Give it here.
How much did you score in maths?

1010
01:49:19,416 --> 01:49:20,958
Get your mother.

1011
01:49:21,291 --> 01:49:24,458
-What is it?
-The blood sample reports.

1012
01:49:29,291 --> 01:49:30,541
Something wrong, Sir?

1013
01:49:44,875 --> 01:49:46,375
Go inside the building.

1014
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:48,041
Leave the bag in the elevator.

1015
01:49:48,125 --> 01:49:49,291
Once I get the money

1016
01:49:49,375 --> 01:49:50,458
you'll get the evidence.

1017
01:49:50,541 --> 01:49:53,708
No dirty tricks. Or else, you can
watch your story on TV tonight.

1018
01:50:50,291 --> 01:50:51,125
Ismail!

1019
01:50:54,083 --> 01:50:54,916
Stop.

1020
01:50:56,833 --> 01:50:57,916
Stop!

1021
01:51:10,083 --> 01:51:11,833
-Where's the evidence?
-I don't have it.

1022
01:51:12,041 --> 01:51:13,625
-Who has it?
-Sakku.

1023
01:51:13,708 --> 01:51:14,583
Where is she?

1024
01:51:14,916 --> 01:51:16,708
In the basement.

1025
01:51:17,041 --> 01:51:18,166
Murli!

1026
01:51:18,791 --> 01:51:19,833
Murli, are you okay?

1027
01:51:26,875 --> 01:51:29,083
Murli, what was that sound?

1028
01:51:29,458 --> 01:51:32,250
We've got the cash. He's in the elevator.

1029
01:51:43,250 --> 01:51:46,625
Help! Let me out!

1030
01:51:48,583 --> 01:51:49,625
Let me out!

1031
01:52:09,958 --> 01:52:11,583
What's your plan?

1032
01:52:11,958 --> 01:52:15,833
There's a bathroom with an open window.
The railway station is nearby.

1033
01:52:20,583 --> 01:52:21,583
Are you okay?

1034
01:52:23,125 --> 01:52:24,458
Come here.

1035
01:52:25,458 --> 01:52:27,791
-Take the blindfold off, Akash.
-No.

1036
01:52:28,125 --> 01:52:31,208
I can guide you to find the way out.
We're running out of time.

1037
01:52:36,916 --> 01:52:40,291
Take the blindfold off.
Don't untie my hands.

1038
01:52:40,625 --> 01:52:43,250
Time's running out. I'll guide you.

1039
01:52:43,916 --> 01:52:45,291
Why is this shut?

1040
01:52:47,041 --> 01:52:49,250
Take the blindfold off,
for goodness sake.

1041
01:52:49,333 --> 01:52:52,250
Time's running out. I'll guide you.

1042
01:53:06,666 --> 01:53:09,083
We are in some sort of a storeroom.

1043
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:13,166
-Are the windows closed?
-Yes. No sign of a door or bathroom.

1044
01:53:16,458 --> 01:53:20,875
There's a glass partition.
Can you break it?

1045
01:53:22,166 --> 01:53:23,666
-Where is it?
-A little ahead.

1046
01:53:24,791 --> 01:53:26,750
Walk a few steps. Found it?

1047
01:53:31,458 --> 01:53:33,375
-Where?
-Ahead.

1048
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:36,041
Where? Right? Left? Be clear.

1049
01:53:36,125 --> 01:53:37,500
Straight ahead.

1050
01:53:38,875 --> 01:53:40,000
Now, turn around.

1051
01:53:44,416 --> 01:53:46,625
Here? What's this?

1052
01:53:47,125 --> 01:53:48,791
The bed frame.

1053
01:53:58,333 --> 01:54:00,458
-What are you up to?
-Nothing. Turn right.

1054
01:54:06,833 --> 01:54:07,750
Murli!

1055
01:54:09,833 --> 01:54:12,666
We are reaching the hospital.

1056
01:54:13,250 --> 01:54:15,708
Murli, keep talking. Don't fall asleep.

1057
01:54:19,708 --> 01:54:20,833
Murli.

1058
01:54:21,708 --> 01:54:22,708
What's wrong?

1059
01:54:25,750 --> 01:54:28,375
-Murli!
-Step outside. Please.

1060
01:54:28,458 --> 01:54:29,416
Murli!

1061
01:54:33,291 --> 01:54:36,041
Bend down, lower. A little more.

1062
01:54:36,458 --> 01:54:39,291
It's a fire extinguisher. Pick it up.

1063
01:54:40,625 --> 01:54:43,333
Break the glass partition with it.

1064
01:54:44,333 --> 01:54:46,416
Throw it. Not towards me.

1065
01:54:46,666 --> 01:54:47,666
I'm right here.

1066
01:54:48,041 --> 01:54:49,250
Face the other way.

1067
01:54:51,791 --> 01:54:52,625
What?

1068
01:54:52,708 --> 01:54:56,708
Walk straight ahead.
Veer slightly to your left.

1069
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:00,583
Shall I throw it?

1070
01:55:05,791 --> 01:55:07,500
-It's smashed.
-Done.

1071
01:55:07,583 --> 01:55:10,916
Where are you going now? Careful.
There's broken glass everywhere.

1072
01:55:11,083 --> 01:55:13,083
-There are clothes on the bed.
-Where?

1073
01:55:13,166 --> 01:55:14,333
To your left.

1074
01:55:15,458 --> 01:55:17,208
Wrap it around your hands.

1075
01:55:38,916 --> 01:55:42,583
Mrs. Sinha, will you come with me
to the police station?

1076
01:56:21,208 --> 01:56:22,166
Akash.

1077
01:56:36,083 --> 01:56:37,791
You drew my blood out, you scum!

1078
01:56:38,291 --> 01:56:40,291
Help! Help me!

1079
01:56:40,916 --> 01:56:43,750
-The next train is in an hour.
-Murli!

1080
01:56:44,125 --> 01:56:45,333
Get off me!

1081
01:56:48,458 --> 01:56:51,291
Catch her!

1082
01:56:51,375 --> 01:56:52,791
Let go!

1083
01:56:53,291 --> 01:56:54,416
Let me go!

1084
01:56:59,250 --> 01:57:01,458
Stop it! Let me go!

1085
01:57:03,500 --> 01:57:04,708
Let me go.

1086
01:57:22,708 --> 01:57:24,000
You saved my life.

1087
01:57:27,083 --> 01:57:29,833
Where are my specs?

1088
01:57:30,500 --> 01:57:33,500
Help me carry her. She's our jackpot.

1089
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:37,791
Is Murli okay, Doctor?

1090
01:57:38,875 --> 01:57:39,958
He lost a lot of blood.

1091
01:57:40,125 --> 01:57:43,416
No! Murli can't die! He has to live!

1092
01:57:43,541 --> 01:57:46,916
Doctor, I have lots of money.

1093
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:48,416
Here, take it.

1094
01:57:48,958 --> 01:57:50,208
Doctor.

1095
01:57:50,958 --> 01:57:53,833
Please control yourself.

1096
01:57:54,041 --> 01:57:58,375
There's something you can do if you wish.
You can donate his organs.

1097
01:58:03,541 --> 01:58:04,708
Yes, Sakku?

1098
01:58:07,708 --> 01:58:11,083
It's a total mess. They've escaped.

1099
01:58:11,458 --> 01:58:14,500
I'm leaving town.
Lie low for a few months.

1100
01:58:17,166 --> 01:58:18,375
Murli is dead.

1101
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:28,250
Where are we going?

1102
01:58:28,833 --> 01:58:30,333
To cash in the jackpot.

1103
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:34,041
A private jet is waiting for us
at the Mumbai airport.

1104
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,625
Look. Sorry, listen to this.

1105
01:58:50,541 --> 01:58:54,083
Millions! I'll give you a share.

1106
01:58:57,625 --> 01:58:59,000
You'll have your sight back.

1107
01:58:59,291 --> 01:59:01,166
I don't get it.

1108
01:59:01,708 --> 01:59:04,791
The Sheikh's daughter
needs a liver transplant.

1109
01:59:05,375 --> 01:59:09,875
She has a rare blood type. B Rh Negative.

1110
01:59:10,958 --> 01:59:13,458
-Guess whose blood matches hers?
-Mine?

1111
01:59:14,958 --> 01:59:17,833
If that were the case,
I wouldn't have promised you a share.

1112
01:59:17,958 --> 01:59:20,083
It's your Lady Macbeth's blood.

1113
01:59:21,041 --> 01:59:25,541
Remember that blood test
we made her undergo?

1114
01:59:26,375 --> 01:59:31,291
The nurse did a routine check.
We've hit the jackpot!

1115
01:59:34,250 --> 01:59:38,083
If her cornea matches yours, that
would be like an icing on the cake.

1116
01:59:38,375 --> 01:59:40,208
Do you want to kill her?

1117
01:59:40,458 --> 01:59:41,583
She'll die anyway.

1118
02:00:57,333 --> 02:01:03,750
A dusky skinned girl,
Hazy and slightly crazy

1119
02:01:04,666 --> 02:01:10,500
She trembles like a wavering leaf
When angry

1120
02:01:11,708 --> 02:01:18,250
When she happens to hear my name

1121
02:01:19,458 --> 02:01:25,958
She tries hard to disguise her feelings

1122
02:01:26,833 --> 02:01:33,208
Tell me if you happen to bump into her

1123
02:01:34,166 --> 02:01:40,791
Tell me if you happen to bump into her

1124
02:01:41,583 --> 02:01:47,166
She wrinkles her eyes
In the bright sunlight

1125
02:01:48,875 --> 02:01:54,333
Takes deep drags of life
As she walks along

1126
02:01:56,250 --> 02:02:02,916
Tell me if you happen to bump into her

1127
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:10,750
Tell me if you happen to bump into her

1128
02:03:16,875 --> 02:03:17,833
Sophie?

1129
02:03:20,125 --> 02:03:22,458
You are fooling people here as well.

1130
02:03:24,833 --> 02:03:26,125
It's a long story.

1131
02:03:52,166 --> 02:03:53,166
And then?

1132
02:03:56,666 --> 02:03:57,916
She'll die anyway.

1133
02:04:01,708 --> 02:04:03,750
Doctor, she confessed in your presence.

1134
02:04:03,833 --> 02:04:07,166
The cops will arrest her soon enough.
So, let her go.

1135
02:04:07,625 --> 02:04:11,000
Let go of millions?
How can you feel sorry for her?

1136
02:04:11,791 --> 02:04:15,291
She murdered two people and blinded you.

1137
02:04:16,541 --> 02:04:19,791
Any court of law would give her
the death penalty.

1138
02:04:20,083 --> 02:04:21,666
It's not just about the money.

1139
02:04:23,125 --> 02:04:25,166
The Sheikh's daughter will get a new life.

1140
02:04:25,500 --> 02:04:27,333
And you'll get your eyesight back.

1141
02:04:27,458 --> 02:04:29,416
There are the kidneys too.

1142
02:04:29,875 --> 02:04:34,500
Her death will give new life
to many people. Just imagine!

1143
02:04:53,541 --> 02:04:54,958
Hold this.

1144
02:04:57,916 --> 02:04:58,750
This is wrong.

1145
02:05:00,500 --> 02:05:03,666
There's a bus stop up ahead.
I'll drop you there.

1146
02:05:06,250 --> 02:05:09,250
Only you!
Because you saved my life.

1147
02:05:48,291 --> 02:05:52,375
If we killed her and took her eyes,
I'd never be able to play the piano again.

1148
02:05:54,875 --> 02:05:57,708
I said all that stuff just to scare her.

1149
02:06:03,875 --> 02:06:06,666
Why do we need to take
her liver and kidneys?

1150
02:06:09,625 --> 02:06:11,291
I won't let you do that.

1151
02:06:11,791 --> 02:06:14,291
Can you pull over?

1152
02:06:14,375 --> 02:06:16,041
Let us go, please.

1153
02:06:20,125 --> 02:06:23,125
Trust me, Doctor.
I won't tell anyone about you.

1154
02:06:34,291 --> 02:06:35,500
Get down.

1155
02:07:53,541 --> 02:07:57,125
A little later, I got into a bus
that took me to Mumbai.

1156
02:07:59,625 --> 02:08:01,208
Why didn't you come back to me?

1157
02:08:03,916 --> 02:08:07,875
I didn't have the guts.
I wanted to get away from it all.

1158
02:08:09,458 --> 02:08:11,666
A friend helped me to get to London.

1159
02:08:23,916 --> 02:08:26,541
Tomorrow, I'm having a
concert at Main Square.

1160
02:08:27,166 --> 02:08:28,291
Will you come?

1161
02:08:32,291 --> 02:08:34,166
I'm flying back tomorrow.

1162
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,708
She ruined so many lives.

1163
02:08:46,291 --> 02:08:50,666
You should've listened to Dr. Swami
and taken Simi's eyes.
