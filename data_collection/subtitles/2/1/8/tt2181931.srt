1
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:09,959
Shashi... tea!

2
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:22,459
Sapna!

3
00:03:24,584 --> 00:03:25,751
Give me my phone.

4
00:03:25,834 --> 00:03:26,542
No...

5
00:03:26,626 --> 00:03:28,459
What no... have your breakfast first...

6
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,917
Why don't you stop this white bread...

7
00:03:32,001 --> 00:03:33,501
why can't you get brown!

8
00:03:33,584 --> 00:03:34,751
Give it to me...

9
00:03:34,834 --> 00:03:37,126
I like white blue red... anything.

10
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,626
No Maaji...

11
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:40,501
your porridge is ready.

12
00:03:40,584 --> 00:03:42,667
Can I eat one parantha at least?

13
00:03:42,751 --> 00:03:45,834
Mom... you've had enough
paranthas all your life...

14
00:03:45,917 --> 00:03:46,792
it's time you had porridge now.

15
00:03:46,876 --> 00:03:49,334
Shashi where's my parantha?
Hurry up please...

16
00:03:49,417 --> 00:03:51,459
Sagar... your bournvita.

17
00:03:52,334 --> 00:03:54,292
It's too white... make it brown!

18
00:03:54,542 --> 00:03:56,792
Everyone wants only brown brown...

19
00:04:01,042 --> 00:04:02,876
Mom look... thief!

20
00:04:03,917 --> 00:04:05,167
One sweet ladoo mom!

21
00:04:05,251 --> 00:04:06,792
OK my darling... have one.

22
00:04:06,876 --> 00:04:07,834
You're sick...

23
00:04:07,917 --> 00:04:10,251
you are going to
become a ladoo very soon.

24
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:14,792
Eat eat... eat more...

25
00:04:15,042 --> 00:04:16,584
you all are going to die very soon.

26
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:18,167
Sapna quiet

27
00:04:18,376 --> 00:04:20,042
you should eat what you like.

28
00:04:20,501 --> 00:04:21,501
Exactly.

29
00:04:21,584 --> 00:04:23,376
This new fad of brown bread...
egg whites...

30
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:26,001
all started since you
joined this new dance class...

31
00:04:26,209 --> 00:04:28,584
that... that jhaaaz dance!

32
00:04:39,876 --> 00:04:40,876
What's so funny?

33
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:47,751
I can't control it... it's too funny...

34
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:52,542
Mama... say... what dance? What class?

35
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,751
Which class?

36
00:04:56,084 --> 00:04:56,804
Eat your omelette.

37
00:04:56,834 --> 00:04:59,459
Where's the omelette?
There's only toast and parantha here.

38
00:05:03,084 --> 00:05:05,709
Come on Dad...
let's do the jhaaaz dance!

39
00:05:06,376 --> 00:05:08,501
Sapna... your omelette.

40
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:10,792
Mom it is not jhaaaz dance...

41
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:13,001
it is jazz dance.

42
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,792
Jaazz...

43
00:05:39,334 --> 00:05:40,709
Jaazz...

44
00:05:41,334 --> 00:05:42,959
J...Jhazz...

45
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,917
Jaazzz... Jazz...

46
00:05:46,334 --> 00:05:48,959
Aye careful... pack properly...

47
00:05:49,292 --> 00:05:51,459
Ma'am... It has to be gipt packed?

48
00:05:52,376 --> 00:05:54,626
Not 'gipt'... it's GIFT...

49
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:56,084
Gipt... gipt...

50
00:05:57,334 --> 00:05:58,459
Never mind...

51
00:06:00,876 --> 00:06:03,167
Satish... is the car free?

52
00:06:03,334 --> 00:06:06,126
I have a lot of
orders for sweets today...

53
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:08,751
Why do you need to go? Send Ramu...

54
00:06:08,834 --> 00:06:10,792
I need to go for a meeting...

55
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,209
Nice to see you Shashi...

56
00:06:18,376 --> 00:06:20,209
The ladoos were
excellent the last time!

57
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:21,542
Thank you.

58
00:06:21,626 --> 00:06:22,917
Come in...

59
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:28,417
Will need more ladoos
next week as well.

60
00:06:29,084 --> 00:06:31,084
Give me one ladoo before she sees.

61
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:39,167
Next, Modern Colony.

62
00:06:39,251 --> 00:06:40,126
Yes madam.

63
00:06:44,167 --> 00:06:45,917
Hello... come in.

64
00:06:46,001 --> 00:06:46,961
Sorry I'm a little late.

65
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:48,417
No problem at all.

66
00:06:51,417 --> 00:06:53,959
Come... let's all taste the ladoos.

67
00:07:00,251 --> 00:07:01,959
They are really excellent!

68
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:05,167
You've done a great job!

69
00:07:07,584 --> 00:07:08,834
Excuse me.

70
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:11,459
Satish...

71
00:07:11,751 --> 00:07:13,334
the ladoos were a super hit today!

72
00:07:13,584 --> 00:07:14,667
Everyone loved...

73
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:16,751
I'm busy right now...
can we talk later please?

74
00:07:24,876 --> 00:07:25,709
Sagar...

75
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:27,876
how many times have I told you...
not to do this.

76
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:32,334
What are you doing!

77
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:34,834
Where's Sapna?

78
00:07:35,126 --> 00:07:37,626
First do that Michael Jackson thing.

79
00:07:38,126 --> 00:07:39,084
Tell me.

80
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,084
First do!

81
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:43,709
First do! First do!

82
00:07:53,876 --> 00:07:55,126
OK?

83
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,334
Where's Sapna?

84
00:07:57,876 --> 00:08:00,876
She's gone to Rupal's house...
to study.

85
00:08:01,376 --> 00:08:02,834
What exam?

86
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:05,209
Must he some test vest...

87
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:09,042
No test vest mama...
Cafe Coffee Day!

88
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:12,209
You've let out the secret...

89
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:13,667
what will Sapna do to you now?

90
00:08:14,001 --> 00:08:16,626
She's gone to Cafe Coffee Day
with her friends...

91
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:19,042
she's having cold coffee.

92
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:21,584
Aren't you gotten angry?

93
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:24,792
Not 'gotten'...getting...

94
00:08:25,126 --> 00:08:26,917
I am not getting angry...

95
00:08:27,251 --> 00:08:28,584
what to do?

96
00:08:29,584 --> 00:08:31,876
She's worn a really short skirt...

97
00:08:32,084 --> 00:08:33,709
At least she has worn a skirt!

98
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:35,626
There are hoys with her too!

99
00:08:36,084 --> 00:08:37,459
Lucky hoys!

100
00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:39,459
You don't have a problem
with any of this?

101
00:08:39,542 --> 00:08:41,876
I can't hear anything.

102
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:47,459
What?

103
00:08:49,084 --> 00:08:51,917
There's some cold coffee
on your skirt.

104
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:54,959
Where have you been?

105
00:08:56,209 --> 00:08:57,126
Studying.

106
00:08:57,209 --> 00:08:58,084
With whom?

107
00:08:58,709 --> 00:08:59,959
With Rupal.

108
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:01,959
Can't you study at home?

109
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:05,167
You think you can teach me...

110
00:09:05,376 --> 00:09:06,709
English Literature?

111
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:30,167
Wow... great curry!

112
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:35,667
Thank god I didn't eat out...

113
00:09:38,001 --> 00:09:39,667
Give me that chilly pickle...

114
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:44,917
Shashi...

115
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:49,251
you should stop making
those ladoos vadoos

116
00:09:51,501 --> 00:09:53,001
I have just one passion...

117
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:54,667
you want me to give that up too?

118
00:09:57,459 --> 00:09:58,334
Then give me...

119
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,959
one Shashi Special Ladoo!

120
00:10:11,584 --> 00:10:13,542
Only I should eat your food...

121
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:15,417
why should others enjoy it?

122
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:17,751
If I didn't cook well...

123
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:20,547
you wouldn't even
bother to come home, right?

124
00:10:20,626 --> 00:10:23,209
I've important
meetings to attend to...

125
00:10:23,292 --> 00:10:24,917
these talks take time.

126
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:29,376
Talking to me is not important right?

127
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:34,167
Oh I forget...

128
00:10:34,792 --> 00:10:37,542
'important talks'
happen only in English.

129
00:10:48,376 --> 00:10:50,501
Why waste time talking?

130
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:00,084
No! No! No!

131
00:11:00,334 --> 00:11:02,834
Dad how could you do this? Please!

132
00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:05,376
Sapna...

133
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:08,251
What happened?

134
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,084
Hello.

135
00:11:11,626 --> 00:11:12,542
Hello.

136
00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:14,292
Satish... What happened?

137
00:11:14,376 --> 00:11:15,667
Why is Sapna yelling?

138
00:11:15,751 --> 00:11:18,292
Shashi... I won't he able to go
to the PTA meeting.

139
00:11:20,292 --> 00:11:21,709
How can you do this?

140
00:11:22,376 --> 00:11:23,709
No wonder she is angry...

141
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:26,459
Told her you will go with her...

142
00:11:26,542 --> 00:11:27,501
Me?

143
00:11:28,626 --> 00:11:29,709
How can I...

144
00:11:29,792 --> 00:11:31,959
What do you mean by how?
Aren't you a parent too?

145
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:35,376
What will I say there?

146
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:36,419
Don't be silly Shashi...

147
00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:37,709
you're not going into a jungle...
it's a school...

148
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:38,709
they're not going to eat you up.

149
00:11:38,792 --> 00:11:40,209
Now I have to go... bye

150
00:11:45,542 --> 00:11:46,709
I will come with you...

151
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:47,626
There is no need...

152
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:50,834
I will tell them you're
ill and Dad's not in town.

153
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:53,584
Why ill? Tell them I'm dead.

154
00:11:53,917 --> 00:11:55,334
Don't he dramatic mom.

155
00:11:56,084 --> 00:11:58,042
Do you even know what PTA means?

156
00:11:58,792 --> 00:11:59,751
No...

157
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:02,251
I may not know the meaning of PTA...

158
00:12:02,542 --> 00:12:04,834
hut I certainly know
the meaning of a parent.

159
00:12:05,584 --> 00:12:07,667
Now before I get really angry...

160
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:08,751
go get ready.

161
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:21,001
Which one is your classroom?
7A... this one?

162
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:24,334
Which one is your seat?

163
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:27,084
Not seat... desk... second last row.

164
00:12:27,376 --> 00:12:28,876
You sit so far back?

165
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,417
It doesn't make a difference...
come on...

166
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:31,626
That's really far back...

167
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:36,126
Hi Sapna...

168
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:37,042
Hi Rupal!

169
00:12:37,334 --> 00:12:39,251
Hello hello!

170
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:40,667
I'm Neelam...

171
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:43,126
commonly known as
Rupal's mother these days

172
00:12:43,501 --> 00:12:46,251
I'm... Sapna mother... Shashi.

173
00:12:46,334 --> 00:12:48,126
How nice to meet you Shashi.

174
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,084
But I have a hone to pick with you.

175
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:52,834
Every time that Rupal
comes to eat at your house

176
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:54,251
she comes back home and tells me

177
00:12:54,334 --> 00:12:56,042
I have to learn how to cook from you.

178
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,959
No aunty... even your food is...

179
00:12:59,501 --> 00:13:00,334
fantabulous!

180
00:13:00,417 --> 00:13:01,959
What a sweet little liar.

181
00:13:02,376 --> 00:13:04,584
But you must invite
me home soon Shashi...

182
00:13:04,876 --> 00:13:07,751
then you and I can sit and
gossip about these Siamese twins.

183
00:13:07,834 --> 00:13:09,001
Yes... yes aunty...

184
00:13:09,084 --> 00:13:10,459
please come... anytime!

185
00:13:11,376 --> 00:13:14,376
Mom, you wanted to use the loo right?

186
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:16,084
So nice to meet you Shashi.

187
00:13:16,167 --> 00:13:17,376
Bye... see you soon.

188
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:21,501
What loo?

189
00:13:21,584 --> 00:13:22,667
Come come come...

190
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:24,876
please sit inside...
I'll be just a minute...

191
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:28,292
Is this your English teacher?

192
00:13:28,376 --> 00:13:31,084
Yes... Father Vincent...
my class teacher...

193
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:34,001
Yes Sapna...

194
00:13:34,292 --> 00:13:35,459
How are you?

195
00:13:35,542 --> 00:13:36,876
Mrs Godbole right?

196
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,126
Pleasure to meet you.

197
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:39,751
How's Mr Godbole?

198
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:41,167
Fine... very fine.

199
00:13:43,417 --> 00:13:44,376
So... Sapna...

200
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:45,667
what should we start with?

201
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:50,209
As I had discussed with
Mr Godbole at the last PTA...

202
00:13:50,501 --> 00:13:52,251
Sapna's performance
continues to be excellent...

203
00:13:52,334 --> 00:13:54,251
Sir... sorry... father...

204
00:13:56,709 --> 00:13:58,542
my English not good.

205
00:13:59,251 --> 00:14:01,501
If you don't mind...

206
00:14:01,584 --> 00:14:04,251
can we talk in Hindi?

207
00:14:08,001 --> 00:14:09,292
Of course Mrs Godbole...

208
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:11,334
Hindi is our national Language...

209
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,251
we should all speak in it...

210
00:14:13,501 --> 00:14:15,542
hut... my Hindi not very good...

211
00:14:15,751 --> 00:14:16,876
is that okay?

212
00:14:17,084 --> 00:14:18,167
No problem!

213
00:14:18,751 --> 00:14:20,084
I am from Kottayam district you see...

214
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:22,542
Kottayam... that's in Kerala right?

215
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:25,042
It's famous for its
banana wafers right?

216
00:14:25,126 --> 00:14:27,042
Do you like them?

217
00:14:27,126 --> 00:14:28,292
Very much!

218
00:14:28,376 --> 00:14:29,626
Next time I go I...

219
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:32,042
I'll bring back a big
packet of chips for you.

220
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:38,167
Is she doing well in her studies?

221
00:14:38,251 --> 00:14:38,959
Of course...

222
00:14:39,042 --> 00:14:41,417
she is one of the top
5 students of our class.

223
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:43,001
She could rank first...

224
00:14:43,084 --> 00:14:45,792
if she showed more interest in Physics.

225
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:48,501
But is her English good?

226
00:14:48,584 --> 00:14:50,042
Her English is excellent.

227
00:14:51,251 --> 00:14:53,751
Mrs Godbole...
she is one of our brightest students.

228
00:14:55,584 --> 00:14:57,917
But is she respectful?

229
00:14:58,084 --> 00:15:00,001
Does everyone like her?

230
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:02,834
Sapna... you haven't told
your mum about your fan club?

231
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:07,959
Bu Mrs Godbole,
I wanted to talk to you about...

232
00:15:08,042 --> 00:15:09,917
this inter-school quiz competition.

233
00:15:10,584 --> 00:15:11,917
Sapna has been chosen...

234
00:15:12,334 --> 00:15:14,751
Sapna has 'choosen' for the school...

235
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:17,001
been 'choosed'...

236
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:18,917
Has been chosen!

237
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,126
I warned you about my Hindi.

238
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:26,459
She will need to stay back
an extra hour in school...

239
00:15:26,876 --> 00:15:27,836
for practice sessions...

240
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,417
Sir... I have already
spoken to my dad about this...

241
00:15:30,501 --> 00:15:31,501
and there is no problem.

242
00:15:31,584 --> 00:15:33,542
Yes hut you haven't
spoken to your mum...

243
00:15:33,626 --> 00:15:35,106
Ma'am, I need your permission please.

244
00:15:35,251 --> 00:15:36,751
Not a problem father...

245
00:15:36,834 --> 00:15:38,959
our school must win.

246
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:43,209
Although the Coffee Day
business will suffer a hit.

247
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:46,584
Thank you Mrs Godbole...

248
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:48,876
I'll see you at the next PTA meeting?

249
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,917
And don't forget the banana chips.

250
00:16:03,001 --> 00:16:04,751
Of course not...

251
00:16:04,834 --> 00:16:06,167
Thank you sir.

252
00:16:13,084 --> 00:16:14,417
Everything went well right?

253
00:16:15,084 --> 00:16:16,251
Banana chips!

254
00:16:16,626 --> 00:16:18,501
Is Father Vincent your uncle?

255
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:22,584
Father Vincent was so kind...

256
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:24,709
so polite...

257
00:16:26,126 --> 00:16:28,459
he said something in jest...

258
00:16:28,542 --> 00:16:31,167
and I went along with it.

259
00:16:31,584 --> 00:16:33,709
He didn't seem to mind at all...

260
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:38,167
he made me feel so comfortable...

261
00:16:38,501 --> 00:16:39,876
by talking in Hindi.

262
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:42,667
And you made him
feel so uncomfortable...

263
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,001
by talking in Hindi.

264
00:16:44,084 --> 00:16:45,584
"Is Sapna a good girl...

265
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:47,417
does everyone love her"...

266
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:52,042
And why joke about Cafe Coffee Day...

267
00:16:52,126 --> 00:16:53,542
Dad should have been there...

268
00:16:54,084 --> 00:16:55,417
and you were talking in Hindi...

269
00:16:55,501 --> 00:16:56,959
even to Rupal's mother.

270
00:16:57,042 --> 00:16:58,959
Each time I had to answer for you.

271
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:17,792
What happened?

272
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:20,084
Failed her exams?

273
00:17:20,167 --> 00:17:21,542
I'm the one who's failed.

274
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:23,417
Meaning?

275
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,501
I have embarrassed her today.

276
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:31,751
All teenagers feel their mom
and dad are an embarrassment.

277
00:17:32,126 --> 00:17:33,584
Not mom and dad...

278
00:17:35,626 --> 00:17:36,834
just mom.

279
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:40,876
Why are you so upset?

280
00:17:41,626 --> 00:17:43,042
Tell me...

281
00:17:43,501 --> 00:17:45,084
why did you marry me?

282
00:17:45,501 --> 00:17:48,126
What can I say...
one look at you and I was hooked!

283
00:17:48,376 --> 00:17:49,917
Isn't there any water?

284
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:52,709
Why didn't you marry a modern woman?

285
00:17:53,334 --> 00:17:56,334
If I gave it so much thought
why would I get married at all...

286
00:17:58,209 --> 00:18:01,542
It's a joke Shashi... come on...

287
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:06,001
What's come over you?

288
00:18:06,542 --> 00:18:08,292
No matter how hard I try...

289
00:18:08,834 --> 00:18:10,501
I just can't seem to please anyone.

290
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:13,834
Sapna's just a child.

291
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:16,084
And you?

292
00:18:19,126 --> 00:18:20,084
Hello...

293
00:18:20,251 --> 00:18:21,292
Manu!

294
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:23,459
Hi... how are you?

295
00:18:23,834 --> 00:18:27,251
Yes I know you
sisters chat regularly...

296
00:18:27,334 --> 00:18:28,834
but what about me.

297
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:30,751
So how is New York?

298
00:18:31,834 --> 00:18:33,084
When are you coming to India?

299
00:18:34,042 --> 00:18:35,917
Last time when you
came along with Radha...

300
00:18:36,001 --> 00:18:38,126
what a wonderful time we had.

301
00:18:39,126 --> 00:18:40,292
So how is...

302
00:18:41,917 --> 00:18:42,959
Meera...?

303
00:18:44,626 --> 00:18:45,876
What!

304
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:47,834
The date's been fixed?

305
00:18:48,876 --> 00:18:50,876
Wedding in New York!

306
00:18:52,126 --> 00:18:53,001
Speak to Shashi...

307
00:18:53,084 --> 00:18:54,584
I can't believe it...

308
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,751
We're going to New York!

309
00:18:56,959 --> 00:18:59,292
Can't sleep... so much noise...

310
00:18:59,376 --> 00:19:00,834
Aye dumbo... wake up...

311
00:19:00,917 --> 00:19:02,334
we're going to New York!

312
00:19:02,417 --> 00:19:04,709
Manu aunty is
sending tickets for us...

313
00:19:05,501 --> 00:19:06,917
so sweet of her... right mom?

314
00:19:09,667 --> 00:19:11,042
Sorry mom...

315
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,292
forget about it please...

316
00:19:14,584 --> 00:19:16,042
just forget it...

317
00:19:16,334 --> 00:19:17,709
we are going to New York!

318
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:18,917
Not going to school?

319
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:22,459
Cousin Meera is getting married.

320
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:25,417
To an American in New York...
how cool!

321
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:26,667
It must be very cold there.

322
00:19:26,751 --> 00:19:28,876
Mom... even it if was hot,
you couldn't come.

323
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:29,626
Why?

324
00:19:29,709 --> 00:19:31,501
You don't have a passport.

325
00:19:32,084 --> 00:19:33,251
You have to make a passport?

326
00:19:33,334 --> 00:19:35,251
Yes you have to...

327
00:19:35,459 --> 00:19:37,667
Tomorrow I'll start
the visa procedures...

328
00:19:37,751 --> 00:19:40,167
first is yours...
since you need to leave before us.

329
00:19:40,251 --> 00:19:41,209
And us?

330
00:19:41,376 --> 00:19:42,417
We will go later.

331
00:19:42,501 --> 00:19:43,542
Why?

332
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:45,626
I've told you...

333
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:47,626
I don't want to go alone

334
00:19:47,834 --> 00:19:50,042
I'll come with you...

335
00:19:50,126 --> 00:19:51,501
on the plane.

336
00:19:51,584 --> 00:19:53,251
What's this alone valone?

337
00:19:53,334 --> 00:19:56,251
You, Sagar and me
will travel together.

338
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:57,917
We will have great fun...

339
00:19:58,001 --> 00:19:59,209
let mummy go ahead.

340
00:19:59,292 --> 00:20:02,376
She needs to help
Manu aunty with the wedding...

341
00:20:02,459 --> 00:20:03,542
really boring work.

342
00:20:03,626 --> 00:20:05,751
We'll join them
later and just have fun.

343
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:07,751
What... no Dad!

344
00:20:07,834 --> 00:20:09,459
What about your quiz competition?

345
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,001
You want to let your team down?

346
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:12,917
I don't have any quiz competition

347
00:20:13,001 --> 00:20:14,584
I can go with mummy.

348
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:16,459
Fine... you'll he
thrown out of school...

349
00:20:16,542 --> 00:20:18,062
you can sit at home and make ladoos.

350
00:20:30,876 --> 00:20:31,501
What?

351
00:20:33,376 --> 00:20:35,001
I've never travelled alone...

352
00:20:35,126 --> 00:20:35,959
how will I manage?

353
00:20:36,042 --> 00:20:37,209
What alone!

354
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:39,667
A hundred people will he
with you on the flight.

355
00:20:43,126 --> 00:20:44,042
Let me take Sagar...

356
00:20:44,126 --> 00:20:45,417
No it's not a good idea...

357
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:47,417
you won't be able to manage.

358
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:48,917
Don't I do it here?

359
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:51,251
But that's America...
it's a foreign land...

360
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:53,251
you can't even speak English well.

361
00:20:59,042 --> 00:21:00,251
Will you he happy...

362
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:02,542
3 weeks without me?

363
00:21:24,459 --> 00:21:26,709
Shashi If I was you...

364
00:21:27,126 --> 00:21:29,959
I would he at the airport right now.

365
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:34,751
Maaji... how do I go?

366
00:21:35,209 --> 00:21:36,917
It's a matter of a few days...

367
00:21:37,084 --> 00:21:38,709
everyone will join you anyway.

368
00:21:39,459 --> 00:21:41,042
She is your only sister...

369
00:21:41,376 --> 00:21:42,834
she's all alone there...

370
00:21:43,084 --> 00:21:44,709
first wedding in the family...

371
00:21:45,334 --> 00:21:47,376
who else will she turn to for help?

372
00:21:50,834 --> 00:21:51,714
And I'm here anyway...

373
00:21:55,126 --> 00:21:56,542
Problem?

374
00:21:56,834 --> 00:21:59,501
Yes... a really big problem.

375
00:22:00,542 --> 00:22:03,126
Will you manage without me?

376
00:22:03,417 --> 00:22:05,167
Yes... few Beyblades...

377
00:22:05,292 --> 00:22:06,542
that Tron game...

378
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:07,667
Ben 10...

379
00:22:07,792 --> 00:22:09,167
and many Hot Wheels cars...

380
00:22:09,334 --> 00:22:11,334
if I get all this I will manage.

381
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,542
And how do you do that thing?

382
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:35,084
O my dear...
my heart doesn't heat without you.

383
00:22:35,167 --> 00:22:37,417
My heart... it feels a twitch.

384
00:22:37,792 --> 00:22:41,501
How do I go to a foreign land?

385
00:22:41,834 --> 00:22:44,251
My heart...

386
00:22:44,417 --> 00:22:46,876
My heart trembles... quivers

387
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:49,584
I am afraid.

388
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:56,417
O my dear...
my heart doesn't heat without you.

389
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,709
My heart... it feels a twitch.

390
00:22:59,042 --> 00:23:03,792
How do I go to a foreign land?

391
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:37,001
Do you embrace
all your colleagues so fondly?

392
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:38,876
It was a hug Shashi.

393
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,334
Are the two of you very close?

394
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:43,834
That's just a way of saying hello...

395
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:45,501
it doesn't mean we are close.

396
00:23:45,584 --> 00:23:47,501
Everybody hugs... it's normal!

397
00:23:47,584 --> 00:23:49,459
We are close right...

398
00:23:49,876 --> 00:23:52,334
maybe that's why we never hug!

399
00:23:54,001 --> 00:23:56,584
Sometimes my heart heats faster.

400
00:23:56,834 --> 00:23:59,042
My left eye flickers.

401
00:23:59,459 --> 00:24:03,167
Will you forget me... I wonder

402
00:24:04,001 --> 00:24:06,542
I know you through and through

403
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:09,126
I know you more than you.

404
00:24:09,376 --> 00:24:13,084
Will your eye wander... I wonder.

405
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:16,001
So ma'am... what do you do?

406
00:24:17,542 --> 00:24:19,501
Making... making snacks...

407
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:20,417
Snacks?

408
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,334
You know you are not
allowed to bring food articles

409
00:24:22,459 --> 00:24:24,126
into the United States of America?

410
00:24:25,376 --> 00:24:26,584
Food... food articles...

411
00:24:27,292 --> 00:24:29,959
My English... weak...

412
00:24:30,376 --> 00:24:31,959
So ma'am how will you
manage in our country...

413
00:24:32,042 --> 00:24:33,459
if you don't know English?

414
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:36,334
Like you are managing in our
country without knowing Hindi!

415
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:49,709
These nights these days.

416
00:24:50,209 --> 00:24:52,584
Your words and ways

417
00:24:52,709 --> 00:24:56,334
I will miss them so...

418
00:24:57,292 --> 00:24:59,751
Your slights and spite.

419
00:25:00,209 --> 00:25:02,459
The way you hold me tight.

420
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:06,376
Makes me pine for more...

421
00:25:09,001 --> 00:25:11,334
Why don't you stop me?

422
00:25:11,501 --> 00:25:13,584
O don't let me go!

423
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:16,584
One mention of you...

424
00:25:16,709 --> 00:25:19,459
I worry... I'm wary...
I think of you...

425
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:21,667
Mama come fast... it's late!

426
00:25:23,876 --> 00:25:26,251
My heart...

427
00:25:26,417 --> 00:25:28,834
My heart trembles... quivers

428
00:25:28,959 --> 00:25:31,626
I am afraid.

429
00:25:38,834 --> 00:25:39,501
Mom...

430
00:25:39,626 --> 00:25:42,417
not possible to say goodbye
without crying in India, right?

431
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,292
She's crying so much.

432
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:53,542
Shashi...

433
00:25:53,709 --> 00:25:55,917
when the immigration guys ask you...

434
00:25:56,542 --> 00:25:57,982
"What is the purpose of your visit?"

435
00:25:58,084 --> 00:25:59,459
what will you say?

436
00:26:00,209 --> 00:26:04,042
"I am going to sister's
place to attend wedding."

437
00:26:04,376 --> 00:26:05,376
Good!

438
00:26:05,542 --> 00:26:08,167
And "What's the duration of
your stay?"

439
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:10,709
I am going to...

440
00:26:10,792 --> 00:26:13,209
I am going to stay in
my sister's place...

441
00:26:14,834 --> 00:26:17,042
Looks like you'll be sent right back!

442
00:26:17,167 --> 00:26:17,667
Why?

443
00:26:17,751 --> 00:26:19,626
Didn't I tell you... DURATION!

444
00:26:19,751 --> 00:26:20,751
DURATION!

445
00:26:20,834 --> 00:26:22,626
Sorry sorry...

446
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:24,959
5 weeks...

447
00:26:27,334 --> 00:26:28,417
Let's go!

448
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:35,667
What are you doing?

449
00:26:36,001 --> 00:26:39,001
If I hug it's a problem,
if I don't it's a problem!

450
00:26:50,126 --> 00:26:51,501
New York...

451
00:26:53,334 --> 00:26:54,626
window seat?

452
00:26:56,542 --> 00:26:58,292
Don't they have this form in Hindi?

453
00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:00,292
I can fill it out for you

454
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:07,709
America?

455
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,334
Yes... my niece is getting married.

456
00:27:13,084 --> 00:27:14,209
All the best.

457
00:27:26,292 --> 00:27:27,001
Open your hag...

458
00:27:27,126 --> 00:27:28,251
no water allowed.

459
00:27:29,001 --> 00:27:30,626
But it's a long journey...

460
00:27:30,751 --> 00:27:32,001
You will get water inside.

461
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:34,042
Eatables are not allowed either.

462
00:27:35,626 --> 00:27:36,459
Just one box?

463
00:27:36,542 --> 00:27:38,001
Sorry ma'am...

464
00:27:39,292 --> 00:27:40,334
Alright?

465
00:27:43,709 --> 00:27:46,876
Satish... they took away
my water bottle...

466
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:50,167
I'm inside the plane...

467
00:27:51,126 --> 00:27:52,251
is Sapna asleep?

468
00:27:52,542 --> 00:27:53,334
Excuse me ma'am...

469
00:27:53,417 --> 00:27:55,084
can you please turn
off your cell phone.

470
00:27:55,167 --> 00:27:55,584
Sorry.

471
00:27:55,667 --> 00:27:57,209
No it's fine... you can keep it.

472
00:28:21,042 --> 00:28:21,792
Water...

473
00:28:22,209 --> 00:28:23,667
You can ring the bell.

474
00:28:28,626 --> 00:28:30,626
Can you get the lady
a glass of water please?

475
00:28:33,209 --> 00:28:36,126
The next 18 hours...
this button is at your service.

476
00:28:56,376 --> 00:28:57,459
You can...

477
00:28:57,876 --> 00:29:00,001
confidently, definitely, surely

478
00:29:00,292 --> 00:29:01,834
absolutely shamelessly

479
00:29:01,917 --> 00:29:03,501
press this button again and again.

480
00:29:08,542 --> 00:29:10,584
See... magic!

481
00:29:13,876 --> 00:29:15,709
Ma'am, veg or non-veg?

482
00:29:19,751 --> 00:29:21,042
Veg... veg...

483
00:29:23,126 --> 00:29:26,417
Would you like some
Chardonnay or Merlot with your meal?

484
00:29:30,584 --> 00:29:32,834
One glass of wine is good for health.

485
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:38,542
Cheers!

486
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,292
It's good stuff.

487
00:30:31,084 --> 00:30:32,084
What's the matter?

488
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:34,667
Just one Hindi movie here...

489
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:36,792
I've seen it on TV.

490
00:30:37,626 --> 00:30:39,542
And 50 English channels...

491
00:30:44,334 --> 00:30:45,209
Here... look...

492
00:30:47,542 --> 00:30:48,542
same picture...

493
00:30:48,626 --> 00:30:50,001
same film...

494
00:30:50,126 --> 00:30:51,542
there's no need for that

495
00:30:54,459 --> 00:30:58,417
I need to talk to my father.

496
00:30:59,376 --> 00:31:01,834
Captain, who bombed the train

497
00:31:02,667 --> 00:31:05,292
I don't know who bombed the train.

498
00:31:06,417 --> 00:31:08,042
Then go back and try again.

499
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:11,251
No! No! No!

500
00:31:14,459 --> 00:31:16,459
Stop this cow dung...

501
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,709
Let's start with the bomb...

502
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:21,209
Excuse me...

503
00:31:21,792 --> 00:31:23,126
are you a terrorist?

504
00:31:23,584 --> 00:31:25,251
We are trying to sleep here...

505
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:32,959
I will go hut...

506
00:31:58,626 --> 00:32:03,084
I am going to sister's
place to attend wedding...

507
00:32:04,917 --> 00:32:05,876
Passport please...

508
00:32:08,667 --> 00:32:10,209
Immigration form...

509
00:32:12,709 --> 00:32:14,167
Please look into the camera ma'am.

510
00:32:15,042 --> 00:32:16,376
Please look into the camera...

511
00:32:19,542 --> 00:32:22,042
What is the purpose of your
visit to the United States?

512
00:32:22,209 --> 00:32:22,959
What?

513
00:32:23,084 --> 00:32:26,084
What... is... the... purpose... of...
your... visit... to the United States?

514
00:32:26,126 --> 00:32:28,126
My sister is attending my wedding.

515
00:32:28,876 --> 00:32:29,792
What?

516
00:32:35,251 --> 00:32:36,876
Ah you're here to attend a wedding!

517
00:32:37,126 --> 00:32:37,917
Yes.

518
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:40,751
Thank you.

519
00:32:45,209 --> 00:32:47,751
- What is the purpose...
- To help the United States of America.

520
00:32:48,084 --> 00:32:49,167
Sorry?

521
00:32:49,417 --> 00:32:50,542
Yeah... you know...

522
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:51,501
to spend some dollars...

523
00:32:51,584 --> 00:32:53,084
help recover your economy.

524
00:32:53,751 --> 00:32:55,584
You don't want it? I can go back...

525
00:32:56,292 --> 00:32:59,542
I am going to sister's
place to attend wedding!

526
00:32:59,917 --> 00:33:02,417
- How dumb am I...
- Listen...

527
00:33:03,709 --> 00:33:05,626
Don't let these people scare you...

528
00:33:05,834 --> 00:33:07,584
it's time for them to get scared of us.

529
00:33:08,126 --> 00:33:09,792
This is your first trip to the US...

530
00:33:10,459 --> 00:33:12,834
and first times happen only once.

531
00:33:13,167 --> 00:33:15,751
Every first experience is special...

532
00:33:15,876 --> 00:33:17,584
so enjoy...

533
00:33:18,626 --> 00:33:21,459
surely, definitely, confidently!

534
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:23,709
All the best!

535
00:33:29,126 --> 00:33:30,709
Shashi aunty!

536
00:33:40,126 --> 00:33:41,501
Mom... you've reached?

537
00:33:41,751 --> 00:33:43,209
I'm in the car!

538
00:33:43,292 --> 00:33:44,167
How are you?

539
00:33:44,292 --> 00:33:45,876
The kids aren't
troubling you I hope...

540
00:33:46,001 --> 00:33:46,917
Hi mama!

541
00:33:47,084 --> 00:33:47,959
Sagar!

542
00:33:53,001 --> 00:33:53,501
Aunty...

543
00:33:53,542 --> 00:33:55,667
no more worrying about Sapna,
Sagar and uncle...

544
00:33:55,792 --> 00:33:58,209
you're in New York...
we're going to have a blast!

545
00:33:58,459 --> 00:34:01,209
New York has really
tall buildings, right?

546
00:34:01,334 --> 00:34:02,209
Saw them from the plane...

547
00:34:02,334 --> 00:34:03,917
Shashi... that's Manhattan...

548
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,792
Man... hat... tan?

549
00:34:06,876 --> 00:34:07,876
'Man' means...

550
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:09,042
aadmi...

551
00:34:09,709 --> 00:34:10,709
'Hat'...means

552
00:34:10,792 --> 00:34:11,542
topi.

553
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:14,209
Mom... what's 'tan' in Hindi?

554
00:34:15,209 --> 00:34:16,834
'Tan'...means...

555
00:34:16,959 --> 00:34:17,917
dhoop ki chaap!

556
00:34:18,001 --> 00:34:20,834

00:35:08,001 --> 00:35:09,959
Remember our Hindi medium school?

571
00:35:12,292 --> 00:35:14,417
We couldn't speak a
single word of English...

572
00:35:14,501 --> 00:35:16,709
not a word!

573
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:20,126
And look at you now...

00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,876
Anil... Anil...

577
00:35:30,251 --> 00:35:32,667
If he hadn't motivated me...

578
00:35:33,126 --> 00:35:34,626
I would have remained the same

579
00:35:35,209 --> 00:35:37,209
I miss him so terribly...

580
00:35:38,501 --> 00:35:40,001

What's that? What did she say?

620
00:37:55,917 --> 00:37:57,251
She just abused you.

621
00:37:59,126 --> 00:38:00,959
So tell me about the dowry,
what are you giving me?

622
00:38:01,126 --> 00:38:03,334

933
00:59:16,001 --> 00:59:18,084
Eva... Eva!

934
00:59:19,959 --> 00:59:21,251
What are these called?

935
00:59:21,709 --> 00:59:22,959
Vowels.

936
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:25,209
Just like bowels.

937
00:59:25,792 --> 00:59:26,876
No Rama...

938
00:59:27,209 --> 00:59:29,084
not like bowels!

939
00:59:29,167 --> 00:59:30,084
Sorry madam...

940
00:59:30,167 --> 00:59:31,751
sir... sorry sir...

941
00:59:31,834 --> 00:59:34,126
I only saying for
remembering purpose...

942
00:59:34,209 --> 00:59:35,417
towels...

943
00:59:35,709 --> 00:59:36,751
bowels...

944
00:59:36,834 --> 00:59:38,959
and... vowels!

945
00:59:39,292 --> 00:59:40,459
Correct?

946
00:59:40,542 --> 00:59:42,709
Now, when a word
begins with a vowel...

947
00:59:42,792 --> 00:59:44,292
like apple...

948
00:59:44,376 --> 00:59:45,959
begins with a vowel 'a'...

949
00:59:46,292 --> 00:59:49,209
we say 'an' apple.

950
00:59:49,292 --> 00:59:51,751
'An' orange...

951
00:59:52,001 --> 00:59:53,209
'An' idiot.

952
00:59:54,167 --> 00:59:55,376
So I...

953
00:59:55,459 --> 00:59:57,126
an Eva?

954
00:59:59,084 --> 01:00:02,084
No... if it's a name...
or a proper noun...

955
01:00:02,167 --> 01:00:04,376
we just say Eva...

956
01:00:04,626 --> 01:00:05,917
not an Eva...

957
01:00:06,001 --> 01:00:07,584
or the India.

958
01:00:07,834 --> 01:00:08,417
Okay?

959
01:00:08,626 --> 01:00:10,959
Just Eva... just Rama.

960
01:00:13,167 --> 01:00:14,334
Yes Shashi?

961
01:00:19,084 --> 01:00:22,917
Why India not 'the India'

962
01:00:23,334 --> 01:00:24,792
and why America

963
01:00:24,876 --> 01:00:26,959
"the United States of America"?

964
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:32,417
That is a very good question Shashi...

965
01:00:32,501 --> 01:00:33,542
and we will come to that once

966
01:00:33,626 --> 01:00:36,209
we do the class on
the various forms of nouns.

967
01:00:39,084 --> 01:00:40,709
What a question you asked madam!

968
01:00:41,126 --> 01:00:43,167
David sir had no answer...

969
01:00:43,376 --> 01:00:44,376
full confusion.

970
01:00:45,042 --> 01:00:46,542
Good question...

971
01:00:46,876 --> 01:00:48,292
Very smart...

972
01:00:49,667 --> 01:00:50,917
Sleeping again.

973
01:00:51,167 --> 01:00:53,334
We are smarter than these people...

974
01:00:53,584 --> 01:00:56,459
we struggle only because
of this bloody English...

975
01:00:56,542 --> 01:00:58,667
else we would have blown them away.

976
01:00:59,584 --> 01:01:00,917
What you say?

977
01:01:01,001 --> 01:01:02,751
I say I come to your parlour...

978
01:01:02,834 --> 01:01:04,042
you give me free hair cut...

979
01:01:04,126 --> 01:01:05,667
and I teach you free Urdu.

980
01:01:06,501 --> 01:01:07,876
You come to parlour...

981
01:01:07,959 --> 01:01:09,084
I shave your head!

982
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:13,042
Spicy noodle...

983
01:01:13,334 --> 01:01:15,084
just like dragon!

984
01:01:16,501 --> 01:01:17,834
Excuse me...

985
01:01:18,251 --> 01:01:19,292
hello...

986
01:01:19,501 --> 01:01:21,001
what is good name?

987
01:01:23,126 --> 01:01:23,876
What did he say?

988
01:01:25,876 --> 01:01:27,792
Strange fellow... weird fellow...

989
01:01:28,084 --> 01:01:30,167
Did you speak in English or in Tamil?

990
01:01:31,709 --> 01:01:34,001
You ask good question.

991
01:01:35,751 --> 01:01:36,376
Good?

992
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:37,542
Very good.

993
01:01:37,626 --> 01:01:38,917
Thank you.

994
01:01:42,042 --> 01:01:44,751
Ask question... me?

995
01:01:45,959 --> 01:01:47,792
You? Me?

996
01:01:48,251 --> 01:01:49,459
Yes!

997
01:01:49,792 --> 01:01:51,042
OK!

998
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:55,292
Cup of coffee...

999
01:01:55,834 --> 01:01:57,876

1000
01:01:59,126 --> 01:01:59,834

01:02:22,417 --> 01:02:25,376
I've changed my point of view.

1012
01:02:25,876 --> 01:02:28,917
Everything around is new

1013
01:02:29,542 --> 01:02:32,709
I'm happy-vappy why, oh why?

1014
01:02:33,167 --> 01:02:36,292
I'm busy-vusy that's why!

1015
01:02:37,834 --> 01:02:39,876
Slowly, slowly, steadily

1016
01:02:40,334 --> 01:02:44,417
I'm learning-vearning a new language.

1017
01:02:44,917 --> 01:02:47,001
Slowly, slowly, steadily

1018
01:02:47,417 --> 01:02:51,126
I'm learning-vearning a new language.

1019
01:02:52,459 --> 01:02:53,834
Extraordinary!

1020
01:02:54,167 --> 01:02:55,501
This passion!

1021
01:02:56,001 --> 01:02:57,251
Morning noon!

1022
01:02:59,292 --> 01:03:00,709
Extraordinary!

1023
01:03:01,292 --> 01:03:02,584
This passion!

1024
01:03:03,084 --> 01:03:04,376
Morning noon!

1025
01:03:06,917 --> 01:03:09,334
It's all about English Vinglish!

1026
01:03:14,167 --> 01:03:16,626
Morning noon English Vinglish!

1027
01:03:38,292 --> 01:03:40,251
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1028
01:03:40,334 --> 01:03:41,417
Breakfast is ready!

1029
01:03:41,501 --> 01:03:43,292
I've taken the day off.

1030
01:03:46,459 --> 01:03:48,084
How do I go to class today?

1031
01:03:48,792 --> 01:03:51,584
Why did you take the day off for me?

1032
01:03:51,917 --> 01:03:54,126
You'll need to take leave
for the wedding too...

1033
01:03:54,501 --> 01:03:56,084
What do you mean?

1034
01:03:56,417 --> 01:03:59,626
I haven't spent any time with you...

1035
01:04:00,126 --> 01:04:02,292
we have so much to catch up on.

1036
01:04:03,334 --> 01:04:05,667
Remember the necklace
Anil's mother had given me?

1037
01:04:05,959 --> 01:04:08,584
I've divided them equally,
one for Meera...

1038
01:04:08,667 --> 01:04:10,376
and one for Radha.

1039
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:13,417
What a beautiful bracelet I found...

1040
01:04:13,959 --> 01:04:15,376
what are you looking for?

1041
01:04:15,459 --> 01:04:17,709
Meera says it's too expensive...

1042
01:04:18,459 --> 01:04:20,626
Do you remember our aunt in Pune?

1043
01:04:20,709 --> 01:04:22,376
She told me to meet the Panditji...

1044
01:04:23,251 --> 01:04:24,626
Panditji...

1045
01:04:25,167 --> 01:04:27,042
I mean... catering...

1046
01:04:27,417 --> 01:04:29,001
you need to meet
the catering people...

1047
01:04:29,084 --> 01:04:31,209
they've called so many times.

1048
01:04:32,126 --> 01:04:33,917
Oh god I totally forgot.

1049
01:04:34,126 --> 01:04:35,209
Meet them today.

1050
01:04:35,292 --> 01:04:36,667
Let's go together.

1051
01:04:37,626 --> 01:04:39,501
Let's get dressed quickly...

1052
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:42,751
we'll meet Radha and
do lunch after that.

1053
01:04:51,459 --> 01:04:52,584
What's wrong?

1054
01:04:52,959 --> 01:04:56,626
Suddenly got a splitting headache...

1055
01:04:56,876 --> 01:04:57,542
Need some medicine?

1056
01:04:57,626 --> 01:05:01,001
No... I should he fine
if I sleep for a hit...

1057
01:05:01,376 --> 01:05:02,667
why don't you go ahead?

1058
01:05:02,917 --> 01:05:04,042
But Shashi...

1059
01:05:04,126 --> 01:05:05,626
Manu... it's important...

1060
01:05:06,001 --> 01:05:07,876
you may not get the time later.

1061
01:05:08,292 --> 01:05:09,751
Please... you must go...

1062
01:05:10,209 --> 01:05:12,584
Only if you promise to sleep.

1063
01:05:14,209 --> 01:05:15,167
Say it with me...

1064
01:05:15,251 --> 01:05:16,751
who is the star?

1065
01:05:17,001 --> 01:05:18,376
I am the star...

1066
01:05:18,459 --> 01:05:20,376
No... I'm the star...

1067
01:05:22,126 --> 01:05:23,542
Sorry...

1068
01:05:24,126 --> 01:05:25,876
sorry sir... late...

1069
01:05:25,959 --> 01:05:26,709
What have you been cooking?

1070
01:05:26,792 --> 01:05:29,251
No cooking... late...

1071
01:05:31,084 --> 01:05:32,209
Come in...?

1072
01:05:33,084 --> 01:05:35,084
You may not...

1073
01:05:36,167 --> 01:05:37,792
Ask again Shashi.

1074
01:05:38,876 --> 01:05:40,126
Come in?

1075
01:05:40,834 --> 01:05:43,584
I can't see you...
are you asking me to come in?

1076
01:05:45,292 --> 01:05:46,876
I can come in?

1077
01:05:47,376 --> 01:05:49,126
You can... the door is wide enough...

1078
01:05:49,459 --> 01:05:51,876
hut you may not!

1079
01:05:52,751 --> 01:05:53,751
Why?

1080
01:05:53,834 --> 01:05:56,542
Shashi... you need to ask...
'may I come in?'

1081
01:05:58,501 --> 01:05:59,667
Sorry...

1082
01:06:00,167 --> 01:06:01,251
May I come in?

1083
01:06:01,334 --> 01:06:03,001
You may!

1084
01:06:07,084 --> 01:06:08,542
May I sit down?

1085
01:06:09,459 --> 01:06:10,876
You may.

1086
01:06:12,167 --> 01:06:13,751
- What is May.
- May?

1087
01:06:13,834 --> 01:06:15,542
May I send this back to India?

1088
01:06:15,626 --> 01:06:16,834
May I go home now?

1089
01:06:16,917 --> 01:06:18,001
May I give lift to you?

1090
01:06:18,084 --> 01:06:19,501
May I give slap to you?

1091
01:06:19,959 --> 01:06:22,834
May I have a coffee with you?

1092
01:06:23,542 --> 01:06:24,417
Not today...

1093
01:06:24,501 --> 01:06:26,084
No? OK...

1094
01:06:26,917 --> 01:06:29,751
May I have a walk with you?

1095
01:06:38,667 --> 01:06:39,876
Your food...

1096
01:06:42,209 --> 01:06:43,709

food is art...

1105
01:07:06,042 --> 01:07:08,917
When a man cooks, it's art...

1106
01:07:09,501 --> 01:07:12,376
when a woman cooks, it's her duty.

1107
01:07:13,334 --> 01:07:14,501
What did you just say?

1108
01:07:16,084 --> 01:07:17,292
I'm sorry...

1109
01:07:19,251 --> 01:07:22,209
Man cooking... art.

1110
01:07:23,792 --> 01:07:25,167

You make people happy.

1117
01:07:42,209 --> 01:07:43,334
You artiste!

1118
01:07:44,501 --> 01:07:46,084

1119
01:07:47,834 --> 01:07:51,334
You must open restaurant here...

1120
01:07:51,417 --> 01:07:52,667
in New York!

1121
01:07:52,876 --> 01:07:56,001
No... you open.

1122
01:07:56,292 --> 01:07:58,167
Maybe... one day...

1123
01:07:59,084 --> 01:08:01,042

1124
01:08:02,751 --> 01:08:03,751

01:08:05,626 --> 01:08:08,001

1126
01:08:08,209 --> 01:08:09,376
No...

1127
01:08:09,751 --> 01:08:11,251
Pasta is Italian food.

1128
01:08:11,751 --> 01:08:14,667
Oh French, Italian not same?

1129
01:08:15,042 --> 01:08:17,834
No... no way!

1130
01:08:20,084 --> 01:08:21,042
For example...

1131
01:08:21,126 --> 01:08:22,251
this white thing?

1132
01:08:22,584 --> 01:08:23,376
That's lasoon...(Garlic)

1133
01:08:23,459 --> 01:08:26,209
Italian food lasoon everywhere

1134
01:08:27,209 --> 01:08:29,459
French food... not everywhere.

1135
01:08:30,709 --> 01:08:32,667
You put lasoon in ladoos?

1136
01:08:32,751 --> 01:08:33,792
No!

1137
01:08:37,751 --> 01:08:38,376
Sugar...

1138
01:08:38,542 --> 01:08:39,792
sweet sweet...

1139
01:08:40,126 --> 01:08:41,126
Dessert!

1140
01:08:42,042 --> 01:08:43,584
You bring me sweet ladoos?

1141
01:08:43,917 --> 01:08:44,834
OK!

1142
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:50,917
You want ticket?

1143
01:09:11,167 --> 01:09:12,917
L-A-S-O-O-N

1144
01:09:14,084 --> 01:09:15,792

01:09:23,959 --> 01:09:25,209
Big white ladoo.

1148
01:09:40,459 --> 01:09:41,876
You stay here?

1149
01:09:42,292 --> 01:09:43,542
No...

1150
01:09:43,917 --> 01:09:45,001
Near?

1151
01:09:45,417 --> 01:09:47,251
This not your station?

1152
01:09:47,334 --> 01:09:48,084
No...

1153
01:09:50,084 --> 01:09:51,251
opposite side...

1154
01:09:52,709 --> 01:09:55,751
train... back... other side...

1155
01:09:58,626 --> 01:09:59,751
Back?

1156
01:10:03,834 --> 01:10:05,001
I go...

1157
01:10:06,709 --> 01:10:07,792
Bye.

1158
01:10:19,917 --> 01:10:21,167
Shashi...

1159
01:10:24,334 --> 01:10:25,792
Hope she's ok...

1160
01:10:43,792 --> 01:10:44,959
You're back?

1161
01:10:45,126 --> 01:10:46,417
How are you feeling?

1162
01:10:46,792 --> 01:10:47,751
Much better.

1163
01:10:47,834 --> 01:10:49,251
Sorry we're late.

1164
01:10:49,667 --> 01:10:52,042
Come let's eat something...

1165
01:11:02,917 --> 01:11:04,334
Indian kitchen... good evening...

1166
01:11:06,876 --> 01:11:09,001
Was he Italian or French?

1167
01:11:23,334 --> 01:11:25,126
Promise me you won't tell anyone?

1168
01:11:27,959 --> 01:11:29,334
What can I order for dessert?

1169
01:11:32,376 --> 01:11:33,876
What happened?

1170
01:11:33,959 --> 01:11:35,334
Mom... I saw a rat...

1171
01:11:35,417 --> 01:11:36,292
a really big rat...

1172
01:11:36,376 --> 01:11:37,584
And it went that way!

1173
01:11:38,001 --> 01:11:39,376
I'll just get the stick

1174
01:11:41,084 --> 01:11:43,292
English classes!

1175
01:11:43,751 --> 01:11:45,042
That's awesome!

1176
01:11:49,459 --> 01:11:50,626
Very very happy to meet you!

1177
01:11:51,959 --> 01:11:53,001
Nice to meet you.

1178
01:11:53,626 --> 01:11:54,667
Shashi madam...

1179
01:11:54,751 --> 01:11:57,126
let us all bunk and go for movie.

1180
01:11:57,209 --> 01:11:58,292
'A' movie...

1181
01:11:58,876 --> 01:12:00,751
Yes David Sir is absent today.

1182
01:12:01,042 --> 01:12:02,959
Even that Africa is sick madam...

1183
01:12:03,042 --> 01:12:04,292
bunking fellow.

1184
01:12:04,626 --> 01:12:06,251
Let us all go for a fine film.

1185
01:12:06,459 --> 01:12:08,751
No fine film... English film!

1186
01:12:08,834 --> 01:12:11,209
Obviously we'll watch an English film...
not Chinese.

1187
01:12:11,292 --> 01:12:13,667
We will all go watch English movie.

1188
01:12:13,751 --> 01:12:14,834
You want to join us?

1189
01:12:14,917 --> 01:12:15,626
No... no...

1190
01:12:15,709 --> 01:12:17,667
Madam you come please...
I buy popcorn

1191
01:12:17,751 --> 01:12:18,584
I have class.

1192
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:20,667
Unfortunately my teacher
hasn't fallen sick...

1193
01:12:21,251 --> 01:12:22,376
I gotto go.

1194
01:12:22,834 --> 01:12:24,126
Aunty... you must go...

1195
01:12:24,542 --> 01:12:26,459
I'll see you after class... bye!

1196
01:12:27,876 --> 01:12:28,751
Bye Radha!

1197
01:12:54,542 --> 01:12:55,917
What he say?

1198
01:12:56,084 --> 01:12:59,251
He say... all you need is love...

1199
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:01,542
everyone should love...

1200
01:13:03,084 --> 01:13:05,501
and kiss people on
your right hand side.

1201
01:13:06,376 --> 01:13:07,459
Salman...

1202
01:13:07,667 --> 01:13:08,709
shut up!

1203
01:13:33,792 --> 01:13:35,126
Wonderful movie no madam?

1204
01:13:35,209 --> 01:13:36,251
Good? You like it?

1205
01:13:36,334 --> 01:13:38,167
So much love... beautiful.

1206
01:13:39,251 --> 01:13:41,542
Shashi... you like the movie?

1207
01:13:42,917 --> 01:13:44,292
Good English practice...

1208
01:13:44,751 --> 01:13:45,626
Yeah...

1209
01:13:45,709 --> 01:13:47,542
Yeah... good English practice...

1210
01:13:47,626 --> 01:13:49,084
- One second.
- No problem.

1211
01:13:51,167 --> 01:13:51,709
Hello?

1212
01:13:51,792 --> 01:13:54,709
Where the hell is my scrapbook?

1213
01:13:56,584 --> 01:13:57,584
I'm sure you've kept it somewhere...

1214
01:13:57,667 --> 01:13:58,917
tell me quick.

1215
01:13:59,959 --> 01:14:01,167
Sapna... why are you yelling?

1216
01:14:01,251 --> 01:14:03,001
Where is it?

1217
01:14:03,251 --> 01:14:05,167
Why don't you calm down.

1218
01:14:05,251 --> 01:14:06,834
How do I calm down mom?

1219
01:14:06,917 --> 01:14:08,876
Why do you touch my things?

1220
01:14:08,959 --> 01:14:11,542
How many times have I told
you not to touch my things!

1221
01:14:12,126 --> 01:14:15,501
Check the second
shelf in your cupboard...

1222
01:14:16,042 --> 01:14:18,584
it's safely tucked
away under your pyjamas

1223
01:14:18,959 --> 01:14:20,584
so that no one reads it...

1224
01:14:20,917 --> 01:14:21,917
I didn't read it either.

1225
01:14:22,001 --> 01:14:23,292
That's because you can't read...

1226
01:14:58,126 --> 01:14:59,417
All ok?

1227
01:15:03,459 --> 01:15:05,292
What right do children have...

1228
01:15:06,417 --> 01:15:08,876
to treat their parents like this?

1229
01:15:09,334 --> 01:15:11,751
They don't even know
the meaning of respect!

1230
01:15:12,459 --> 01:15:14,584
Am I a trash can...

1231
01:15:15,292 --> 01:15:17,167
to dump in whatever they feel like?

1232
01:15:23,959 --> 01:15:25,626
What kind of a relationship is this?

1233
01:15:26,084 --> 01:15:29,542
We do our best to make them happy...

1234
01:15:30,959 --> 01:15:34,917
and how easily they hurt you in return.

1235
01:15:35,834 --> 01:15:37,542
Kids are supposed to be innocent...

1236
01:15:38,542 --> 01:15:40,084
what kind of innocence is this...

1237
01:15:40,709 --> 01:15:43,376
taking advantage of our weakness...

1238
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:50,251
You can teach everything...

1239
01:15:51,376 --> 01:15:53,501
hut how do you teach someone...

1240
01:15:54,917 --> 01:15:56,334
to be sensitive to others?

1241
01:15:58,459 --> 01:15:59,792
I will have a cafe latte...

1242
01:15:59,876 --> 01:16:03,251
a double cheese vegetable sandwich
and a glass of iced water please.

1243
01:16:03,751 --> 01:16:04,959
And you sir?

1244
01:16:05,376 --> 01:16:06,876
Cappuccino please...

1245
01:16:07,042 --> 01:16:07,667
Small.

1246
01:16:13,459 --> 01:16:14,751
Shashi...

1247
01:16:15,501 --> 01:16:16,459
you see?

1248
01:16:16,542 --> 01:16:17,542
What?

1249
01:16:18,251 --> 01:16:19,376
You order...

1250
01:16:19,459 --> 01:16:20,542
perfect.

1251
01:16:21,251 --> 01:16:23,501
You order... correct English.

1252
01:16:23,917 --> 01:16:24,459
Now?

1253
01:16:25,751 --> 01:16:28,292
All... ice water...

1254
01:16:31,459 --> 01:16:32,459
Yes... you did it!

1255
01:16:32,542 --> 01:16:33,376
I did it!

1256
01:16:47,001 --> 01:16:49,917
Good to talk... without understanding!

1257
01:16:50,001 --> 01:16:50,917
Sometimes better.

1258
01:16:51,001 --> 01:16:54,001
What a feeling!

1259
01:16:54,792 --> 01:16:57,209
I walk carefree!

1260
01:16:57,417 --> 01:17:00,167
Don't ask me to stop.

1261
01:17:01,001 --> 01:17:04,459
Just let me go on

1262
01:17:05,001 --> 01:17:06,542
I have no fear

1263
01:17:06,792 --> 01:17:08,542
I have no worry

1264
01:17:09,001 --> 01:17:11,501
I hope I don't lose my way.

1265
01:17:11,709 --> 01:17:14,667
If I do... may the road find me!

1266
01:17:15,251 --> 01:17:17,251
Don't make me stop!

1267
01:17:25,751 --> 01:17:28,417
I've changed my point of view.

1268
01:17:29,084 --> 01:17:32,126
Everything around is new

1269
01:17:32,834 --> 01:17:35,917
I'm happy-vappy why oh why?

1270
01:17:36,376 --> 01:17:39,584
I'm busy-vusy that is why!

1271
01:17:42,417 --> 01:17:43,834
Extraordinary!

1272
01:17:44,126 --> 01:17:45,417
This passion!

1273
01:17:45,917 --> 01:17:47,292
Morning noon!

1274
01:17:49,292 --> 01:17:50,542
Extraordinary!

1275
01:17:51,251 --> 01:17:52,376
This passion!

1276
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:54,126
Morning noon!

1277
01:17:56,834 --> 01:17:59,209
It's all about English Vinglish!

1278
01:18:04,042 --> 01:18:05,792
Coffee-Voffee Sugar-Vugar.

1279
01:18:05,959 --> 01:18:07,584
Paper-Vaper News-Vews.

1280
01:18:20,709 --> 01:18:23,501
Manu, I was thinking...

1281
01:18:23,917 --> 01:18:25,792
this buffet system...

1282
01:18:26,292 --> 01:18:29,501
standing and
eating with plates in hand

1283
01:18:30,334 --> 01:18:32,001
is so uncomfortable.

1284
01:18:32,292 --> 01:18:34,417
If we're doing it
all in Indian style...

1285
01:18:34,667 --> 01:18:37,751
then we should serve
food while they're seated.

1286
01:18:39,334 --> 01:18:40,417
Excellent idea!

1287
01:18:40,917 --> 01:18:42,834
And something for shagun...

1288
01:18:42,917 --> 01:18:44,251
Shagun... what's that?

1289
01:18:44,584 --> 01:18:49,584
A small gift for
the guests at the wedding...

1290
01:18:49,667 --> 01:18:51,584
Gift? Shouldn't
we he receiving the gifts?

1291
01:18:53,001 --> 01:18:55,084
I mean 'return gift'...

1292
01:18:55,292 --> 01:18:57,584
in the form of sweets
to be given to guests

1293
01:18:57,667 --> 01:18:59,126
I'll need to order that.

1294
01:18:59,417 --> 01:19:01,584
No order vorder... I'll make it myself!

1295
01:19:01,667 --> 01:19:02,251
Really?

1296
01:19:03,126 --> 01:19:04,042
What was that?

1297
01:19:04,126 --> 01:19:05,709
Kevin... we were just discussing

1298
01:19:05,792 --> 01:19:07,376
how much gold you need to buy us...

1299
01:19:07,459 --> 01:19:09,917
lots and lots of kilograms of gold.

1300
01:19:13,001 --> 01:19:13,917
You hear?

1301
01:19:14,001 --> 01:19:15,792
Sir David and boyfriend break up!

1302
01:19:16,126 --> 01:19:17,626
Sir David very sad

1303
01:19:17,792 --> 01:19:18,667
I know.

1304
01:19:18,751 --> 01:19:21,334
Nothing sad about gay

I think beautiful...
I say beautiful...

1408
01:25:28,501 --> 01:25:29,792
It's been ages since someone...

1409
01:25:29,876 --> 01:25:31,376
said something nice about me

1410
01:25:32,626 --> 01:25:34,251
I was just taken aback... that's all.

1411
01:25:37,417 --> 01:25:38,834
See you tomorrow.

1412
01:25:39,126 --> 01:25:40,417

1413
01:25:54,292 --> 01:25:57,084
What is the matter with you?

1414
01:25:58,626 --> 01:26:02,292
Why are you being so judge...
judgemental...

1415
01:26:09,209 --> 01:26:12,417
You're so judgemental...

1416
01:26:13,834 --> 01:26:14,667
mental?

1417
01:26:23,209 --> 01:26:24,084

1419
01:26:29,959 --> 01:26:31,126
I had a doubt...

1420
01:26:32,834 --> 01:26:34,459
I was watching this film...

1421
01:26:34,542 --> 01:26:40,417
this man keeps calling
this woman 'judgemental'

1422
01:26:40,876 --> 01:26:42,834
She seemed fine to me...

1423
01:26:43,251 --> 01:26:44,501
why was he calling her that?

1424
01:26:44,584 --> 01:26:46,084
What does 'judgemental' mean?

1425
01:26:46,459 --> 01:26:47,376
Mental judge?

1426
01:26:48,167 --> 01:26:48,959
Aunty!

1427
01:26:50,001 --> 01:26:51,417
You're too funny.

1428
01:26:52,292 --> 01:26:55,251
'Judgemental' means...

1429
01:26:57,167 --> 01:26:59,876
You're wearing
a traditional outfit... a sari.

1430
01:27:00,417 --> 01:27:02,792
Just by looking at you...

1431
01:27:03,126 --> 01:27:04,417
without thinking...

1432
01:27:04,501 --> 01:27:06,501
without understanding...

1433
01:27:06,584 --> 01:27:08,251
without knowing you...

1434
01:27:08,334 --> 01:27:09,501
if I were to conclude...

1435
01:27:09,584 --> 01:27:15,834
that you are a typical
Indian conservative woman...

1436
01:27:16,376 --> 01:27:18,167
when in reality

1437
01:27:18,376 --> 01:27:21,292
actually...
you're a free thinking woman

1438
01:27:21,501 --> 01:27:24,042
then I would he called...
'judgemental'!

1439
01:27:26,292 --> 01:27:28,292
Judgemental...

1440
01:27:28,459 --> 01:27:29,626
Aunty...

1441
01:27:29,709 --> 01:27:32,542
you want to learn
so much English so fast?

1442
01:27:32,834 --> 01:27:34,459
I have very little time Radha...

1443
01:27:34,959 --> 01:27:36,417
Can I have more DVDs?

1444
01:27:39,667 --> 01:27:41,667

1445
01:27:42,626 --> 01:27:43,459

1446
01:27:43,542 --> 01:27:45,876

1449
01:27:48,292 --> 01:27:51,959
Oh that's idli... looks delicious.

1450
01:27:53,126 --> 01:27:56,667
Now... we have one week left to go.

1451
01:27:56,917 --> 01:28:00,459
And... on the last day

1452
01:28:00,917 --> 01:28:01,834

1453
01:28:04,334 --> 01:28:07,542
Each one of you will need
to prepare a 5 minute speech.

1454
01:28:09,042 --> 01:28:10,292
A full 5-minute speech?

You will all be wonderful

1461
01:28:29,584 --> 01:28:32,042
I'm sure you will all
pass with flying colours.

1462
01:28:32,251 --> 01:28:33,584
Good luck!

1463
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:34,959

01:30:35,084 --> 01:30:36,376
You alright?

1490
01:31:04,834 --> 01:31:05,792
Shashi!

1491
01:31:30,834 --> 01:31:33,376
Errant heart.

1492
01:31:33,792 --> 01:31:36,501
Heart's in trouble.

1493
01:31:36,792 --> 01:31:40,751
There is trouble in the heart.

1494
01:31:42,792 --> 01:31:45,292
Errant heart.

1495
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:48,084
A hit hard.

1496
01:31:48,792 --> 01:31:52,209
A hit of a coward.

1497
01:31:52,501 --> 01:31:58,709
Why do you stop at
the doorway of pain?

1498
01:31:59,501 --> 01:32:04,209
Why do you put
yourself on trial each time?

1499
01:32:04,542 --> 01:32:10,667
Why do you laugh when you want to cry?

1500
01:32:11,501 --> 01:32:15,751
You fail to decide
between right and wrong.

1501
01:32:15,834 --> 01:32:18,209
Errant heart.

1502
01:32:21,709 --> 01:32:25,001
Heart's in trouble.

1503
01:32:27,709 --> 01:32:30,292
There is trouble in the heart.

1504
01:32:33,751 --> 01:32:36,376
Errant heart.

1505
01:32:41,459 --> 01:32:44,292
Your breath is freezing cold.

1506
01:32:44,626 --> 01:32:48,959
Your eyes are full of smoke.

1507
01:32:53,501 --> 01:33:01,501
Your constant gamble of joy and pain.

1508
01:33:03,709 --> 01:33:09,126
Your eternal sense of hope.

1509
01:33:09,667 --> 01:33:14,584
Your fear of yourself.

1510
01:33:16,626 --> 01:33:22,709
Why do you complicate
an uncomplicated journey?

1511
01:33:23,417 --> 01:33:27,667
Why do you not
listen to your own advice?

1512
01:33:27,751 --> 01:33:29,417
Errant heart.

1513
01:33:32,001 --> 01:33:32,834
Mama!

1514
01:33:32,917 --> 01:33:34,209
Surprise!

1515
01:33:35,751 --> 01:33:37,834
Shocked right?

1516
01:33:40,959 --> 01:33:43,251
You were to come next week...

1517
01:33:43,417 --> 01:33:45,876
It was Manu's idea to surprise you.

1518
01:33:45,959 --> 01:33:47,459
We had to plan so carefully...

1519
01:33:47,542 --> 01:33:48,959
to keep it a secret from you.

1520
01:33:49,167 --> 01:33:51,917
Didn't even tell Radha...
that broadcast channel.

1521
01:33:52,334 --> 01:33:54,251
Everyone's been waiting for you...

1522
01:33:54,417 --> 01:33:56,167
where did you disappear?

1523
01:33:56,417 --> 01:33:59,417
Mama... I had 5 packets of chips...

1524
01:33:59,917 --> 01:34:01,251
7 cokes...

1525
01:34:01,334 --> 01:34:02,584
3 movies!

1526
01:34:03,167 --> 01:34:05,792
And what about your
15 visits to the loo!

1527
01:34:06,667 --> 01:34:08,126
Do you want coffee, Shashi?

1528
01:34:09,334 --> 01:34:12,126
Errant heart.

1529
01:34:12,209 --> 01:34:15,084
Heart's in trouble.

1530
01:34:15,251 --> 01:34:18,584
There is trouble in the heart.

1531
01:34:21,251 --> 01:34:24,084
Errant heart.

1532
01:34:24,292 --> 01:34:27,084
A hit hard.

1533
01:34:27,292 --> 01:34:29,334
A hit of a coward.

1534
01:34:29,417 --> 01:34:31,542
You go everywhere on your own?

1535
01:34:33,417 --> 01:34:34,959
Not had.

1536
01:34:35,626 --> 01:34:37,417
Even those who know English...

1537
01:34:37,501 --> 01:34:38,981
find it difficult here in New York...

1538
01:34:39,001 --> 01:34:41,584
hut you are managing on your own...
amazing!

1539
01:34:44,667 --> 01:34:47,376
You managed there on your own too...
didn't you?

1540
01:34:50,751 --> 01:34:52,167
Barely...

1541
01:34:57,209 --> 01:34:59,459
Mama... I can't sleep...

1542
01:34:59,751 --> 01:35:00,584
what do I do?

1543
01:35:00,667 --> 01:35:01,667
Come to mama.

1544
01:35:01,751 --> 01:35:04,751
You take care of him now...
I'm on holiday.

1545
01:35:06,959 --> 01:35:08,251
Sleep my darling...

1546
01:35:09,042 --> 01:35:10,292
my baby...

1547
01:35:12,376 --> 01:35:13,709
my ladoo...

1548
01:35:22,751 --> 01:35:24,292
Shashi... tea!

1549
01:35:44,167 --> 01:35:46,042
Please pose.

1550
01:35:46,959 --> 01:35:48,251
OK good.

1551
01:35:49,126 --> 01:35:50,917
See...

1552
01:35:51,001 --> 01:35:51,709
see over there...

1553
01:35:51,792 --> 01:35:55,376
Jhaaz! Jhaaz! Jhaaaz!

1554
01:35:56,042 --> 01:35:57,917
Not jazz... jhaaz!

1555
01:35:59,751 --> 01:36:01,876
And next we go to the Empire state.

1556
01:36:02,167 --> 01:36:04,001
Empire State! I want to see it!

1557
01:36:04,084 --> 01:36:05,501
I want to see Empire!

1558
01:36:05,751 --> 01:36:07,959
We'll all see Empire.

1559
01:36:09,417 --> 01:36:10,584
You people go ahead...

1560
01:36:10,876 --> 01:36:12,167
I'll stay here...

1561
01:36:12,251 --> 01:36:14,417
mama's legs are really aching.

1562
01:36:14,501 --> 01:36:16,626
No mama... you have to come.

1563
01:36:19,626 --> 01:36:21,501
It will be very crowded there.

1564
01:36:21,584 --> 01:36:23,126
And if your legs hurt...

1565
01:36:23,209 --> 01:36:24,126
not a good idea...

1566
01:36:24,209 --> 01:36:25,489
there will he really long lines.

1567
01:36:25,709 --> 01:36:26,751
We will go ahead...

1568
01:36:26,834 --> 01:36:27,876
you just chill.

1569
01:36:27,959 --> 01:36:28,834
No!

1570
01:36:28,917 --> 01:36:30,376
Sagar you know what...

1571
01:36:30,459 --> 01:36:32,792
there is this awesome ice cream place.

1572
01:36:32,876 --> 01:36:33,834
It's called Cold Stone.

1573
01:36:33,917 --> 01:36:35,084
Do you know what they do...

1574
01:36:35,167 --> 01:36:37,792
they take a stone and
heat up the ice cream...

1575
01:36:40,167 --> 01:36:42,084
then they add gummy hears and

1576
01:36:42,167 --> 01:36:44,834
chocolate chips and heat it up again.

1577
01:36:45,626 --> 01:36:47,667
Come let's go beat up the ice cream!

1578
01:36:47,751 --> 01:36:49,209
Come let's go!

1579
01:36:50,876 --> 01:36:52,917
Satish uncle let's go...

1580
01:37:33,042 --> 01:37:34,792
Shashi... wait

1581
01:37:37,251 --> 01:37:42,751
I cook French dessert...

1582
01:37:43,459 --> 01:37:44,667
crepe...

1583
01:37:46,792 --> 01:37:48,251
you try, you tell me...

1584
01:37:49,584 --> 01:37:51,459
Why don't you leave me alone!

1585
01:37:52,584 --> 01:37:53,917
Don't you know...

1586
01:37:54,751 --> 01:37:56,042
I'm a married woman.

1587
01:37:56,292 --> 01:37:57,042
Don't you know...

1588
01:37:57,126 --> 01:37:58,751
I'm a mother of two children.

1589
01:38:01,126 --> 01:38:02,376
Do you know...

1590
01:38:02,667 --> 01:38:05,876
they are all waiting for me
at the Empire State Building.

1591
01:38:06,251 --> 01:38:07,167
So tell me...

1592
01:38:07,251 --> 01:38:09,501
should I sit here
with you on the sidewalk

1593
01:38:09,584 --> 01:38:10,667
and eat French fries

1594
01:38:10,751 --> 01:38:12,167
or should I go to my family?

1595
01:38:18,001 --> 01:38:19,167
Shashi...

1596
01:38:21,084 --> 01:38:22,334
Shashi...

1597
01:38:24,001 --> 01:38:25,126
What?

1598
01:38:25,542 --> 01:38:28,959
The Empire state building...
is this way...

1599
01:38:44,876 --> 01:38:46,334
French fries is not French...

1600
01:38:46,417 --> 01:38:47,792
it's an American concept.

1601
01:38:51,834 --> 01:38:54,126
This is French ladoo...

1602
01:38:55,209 --> 01:38:58,376
with organic chocolate 70 %

1603
01:38:59,542 --> 01:39:01,584
you can make it warm if you want.

1604
01:39:25,209 --> 01:39:26,876
Mama!

1605
01:39:27,167 --> 01:39:28,209
Sagar...!

1606
01:39:29,251 --> 01:39:30,292
What happened?!

1607
01:39:30,376 --> 01:39:32,001
He got in the way of the hall...

1608
01:39:32,626 --> 01:39:34,001
I'll go get some water...

1609
01:39:34,459 --> 01:39:35,751
- Mama...!
- How did it happen?

1610
01:39:35,834 --> 01:39:37,376
Where's mom?

1611
01:39:37,542 --> 01:39:39,251
Are you hurt anywhere else?

1612
01:39:41,459 --> 01:39:43,084
Can you please call Shashi Radha?

1613
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:49,709
Mom's phone is with me!

1614
01:39:50,001 --> 01:39:50,917
Where is Shashi?

1615
01:39:51,001 --> 01:39:51,876
Where did she disappear?

1616
01:39:51,959 --> 01:39:53,292
OK come let's go...

1617
01:39:53,501 --> 01:39:54,917
let's take care of Sagar first...

1618
01:39:55,001 --> 01:39:56,334
and I will come back for aunty.

1619
01:39:56,417 --> 01:39:58,542
Brave boy... you'll be ok!

1620
01:41:03,876 --> 01:41:08,001
Mama... do you know what happened?

1621
01:41:08,084 --> 01:41:09,626
Big hall came...

1622
01:41:10,626 --> 01:41:11,292
and I fell

1623
01:41:11,376 --> 01:41:13,042
I didn't see the hall coming...

1624
01:41:13,126 --> 01:41:14,501
otherwise... one kick!

1625
01:41:15,417 --> 01:41:16,334
Liar...

1626
01:41:16,417 --> 01:41:18,334
Nothing happened...
just a little scratch...

1627
01:41:18,417 --> 01:41:21,209
and look at him now... fuss pot!

1628
01:41:22,667 --> 01:41:24,292
Sagar is a strong hoy

1629
01:41:24,376 --> 01:41:25,542
have a cookie...

1630
01:41:26,126 --> 01:41:27,501
drink your milk...

1631
01:41:30,084 --> 01:41:33,209
One magic kiss from
mama and all will be well.

1632
01:41:50,876 --> 01:41:53,042
How's the pain in your leg?

1633
01:42:00,959 --> 01:42:04,876
You must have been in a lot of
pain... to not come with us...

1634
01:42:06,292 --> 01:42:08,042
hut take off by yourself.

1635
01:42:08,626 --> 01:42:11,126
If you don't like
being with us anymore...

1636
01:42:11,209 --> 01:42:12,501
you should have told us...

1637
01:42:12,584 --> 01:42:13,834
we wouldn't have come here.

1638
01:42:13,917 --> 01:42:15,876
Satish... what are you saying...

1639
01:42:15,959 --> 01:42:17,501
What do you mean...'what'?

1640
01:42:19,376 --> 01:42:21,126
What's happened to you Shashi?

1641
01:42:22,667 --> 01:42:25,667
It looks like you were happier alone

1642
01:42:27,167 --> 01:42:28,542
I was just...

1643
01:42:28,626 --> 01:42:32,501
Thank god I didn't send
the kids earlier with you.

1644
01:43:03,792 --> 01:43:04,959
That's it!

1645
01:43:05,876 --> 01:43:08,126
Enough of this English!

1646
01:43:14,042 --> 01:43:15,876
What's happened to me?

1647
01:43:16,751 --> 01:43:19,876
English has become more
important than my children!

1648
01:43:20,834 --> 01:43:24,417
Aunty nothing happened...
Sagar is fine.

1649
01:43:26,292 --> 01:43:27,751
No Radha...

1650
01:43:28,584 --> 01:43:31,126
I should have come along with you all

1651
01:43:32,126 --> 01:43:34,917
I have become so selfish...

1652
01:43:35,917 --> 01:43:38,459
I have forgotten my responsibilities

1653
01:43:40,042 --> 01:43:42,417
I didn't come here to learn English.

1654
01:43:44,001 --> 01:43:46,501
Enough! I'm done with
this English Vinglish!

1655
01:43:46,584 --> 01:43:50,834
Aunty don't do that...
don't give up now.

1656
01:43:51,459 --> 01:43:53,834
Just 3-4 classes left to go...

1657
01:43:54,084 --> 01:43:56,834
What more will I learn in 3-4 days?

1658
01:43:57,626 --> 01:44:00,917
Please inform them...

1659
01:44:01,876 --> 01:44:03,376
I'm quitting.

1660
01:44:03,709 --> 01:44:05,292
Aunty... please...

1661
01:44:05,959 --> 01:44:08,917
just finish what you started...!

1662
01:44:09,626 --> 01:44:12,876
You should finish
what you started right?

1663
01:44:15,751 --> 01:44:17,209
I want to finish...

1664
01:44:18,751 --> 01:44:20,959
what I started long ago...

1665
01:44:24,126 --> 01:44:25,792
being a mother to my children

1666
01:44:56,251 --> 01:44:58,042
I am looking for Professor David.

1667
01:44:58,126 --> 01:44:58,751
Right here!

1668
01:44:58,834 --> 01:44:59,376
Hi, I'm David...

1669
01:44:59,459 --> 01:45:01,334
Hi... I'm Radha, Shashi's niece.

1670
01:45:01,626 --> 01:45:02,917

1672
01:45:04,501 --> 01:45:05,792
I have some had news for you.

1673
01:45:06,917 --> 01:45:09,626
Shashi's not gonna he able
to make it to class anymore.

1674
01:45:09,876 --> 01:45:11,834
No... she has to take her exam!

1675
01:45:11,917 --> 01:45:13,758
I know... her family has
come down from India...

1676
01:45:13,792 --> 01:45:15,709
and we're busy with
my sister's wedding...

1677
01:45:15,792 --> 01:45:16,959
I'll give you my card...

1678
01:45:17,042 --> 01:45:18,584
you have her call me.

1679
01:45:23,042 --> 01:45:24,042
Bonjour!

1680
01:45:24,126 --> 01:45:24,792
How are you?

1681
01:45:24,876 --> 01:45:26,084
Radha...?

1682
01:45:27,334 --> 01:45:28,251
Shashi here?

1683
01:45:28,334 --> 01:45:29,626
No she isn't here...

1684
01:45:29,709 --> 01:45:31,834
I came to talk to David about it...

1685
01:45:32,417 --> 01:45:34,018
she's not going to
take class any more...

1686
01:45:34,042 --> 01:45:36,417
Why? Exam very important for Shashi

1687
01:45:36,501 --> 01:45:38,261
I know... my sister is
getting married and...

1688
01:45:38,334 --> 01:45:41,167
her family has come down from India,
so unfortunately...

1689
01:45:42,459 --> 01:45:45,292
Can I ask for telephone number?

1690
01:45:49,251 --> 01:45:50,584
Ladoo sampling!

1691
01:45:51,209 --> 01:45:53,542
- Kevin... try one...
- Thank you...

1692
01:45:56,792 --> 01:45:58,501
This is incredible...

1693
01:45:59,376 --> 01:46:02,084
I could get married
again and again for this.

1694
01:46:03,251 --> 01:46:06,084
To you... to you... again and again.

1695
01:46:07,584 --> 01:46:09,334
Wow...! Shashi Aunty it's amazing!

1696
01:46:09,417 --> 01:46:12,167
You know Kevin... these are
the best ladoos you will ever eat

1697
01:46:12,251 --> 01:46:13,417
I totally agree.

1698
01:46:13,501 --> 01:46:16,709
And my wife,
she was horn to make ladoos...

1699
01:46:18,126 --> 01:46:19,542
I just gave you a compliment...

1700
01:46:19,626 --> 01:46:21,834
you were horn to make ladoos!

1701
01:46:54,959 --> 01:46:56,917
Manu... we can put marigolds here...

1702
01:46:57,001 --> 01:46:59,334
and jasmine there...

1703
01:46:59,417 --> 01:47:01,001
and the other flower arrangements...

1704
01:47:01,084 --> 01:47:02,959
Mama... Jose is calling you...

1705
01:47:05,126 --> 01:47:08,876
Aunty... you were not
horn only to make ladoos.

1706
01:47:15,542 --> 01:47:17,126
Sagar come here...

1707
01:47:17,876 --> 01:47:20,667
Salman why don't you tell me
the story of your favourite film.

1708
01:47:21,001 --> 01:47:22,751
My favourite movie is...

1709
01:47:22,834 --> 01:47:24,209
Sex and City.

1710
01:47:24,792 --> 01:47:26,834
It is story of 4 sexy girls...

1711
01:47:27,417 --> 01:47:30,709
talking of sex and
walking on the city.

1712
01:47:30,792 --> 01:47:31,959
Very pretty.

1713
01:47:33,792 --> 01:47:36,917
Sir... I like the Rajnikanth film
very very much.

1714
01:47:37,126 --> 01:47:38,709
Rajnikanth is not a actor...

1715
01:47:38,792 --> 01:47:39,667
he's a god!

1716
01:47:39,751 --> 01:47:41,751
He can remove
the underwear of the superman...

1717
01:47:41,834 --> 01:47:45,251
he can catch a bullet with his nose...

1718
01:47:54,042 --> 01:47:57,334
Granny... I will dance to
the 'dhinka chika' song.

1719
01:47:57,626 --> 01:48:00,334
Sagar... dance to this song instead...

1720
01:48:08,626 --> 01:48:10,209
What a boring song!

1721
01:48:10,417 --> 01:48:12,001
Sagar it's awesome!

1722
01:48:12,251 --> 01:48:13,501
Sapna, come with me!

1723
01:48:28,292 --> 01:48:32,126
My sweet pampered favourite bride.

1724
01:48:32,376 --> 01:48:36,042
She loves and desires the moon.

1725
01:48:36,334 --> 01:48:40,001
My sweet pampered favourite bride.

1726
01:48:40,417 --> 01:48:43,959
She loves and desires the moon.

1727
01:48:44,417 --> 01:48:48,001
My God given blessed child.

1728
01:48:48,376 --> 01:48:51,959
Angelic beauty of the Gods

1729
01:48:55,334 --> 01:48:58,584
I hope to see
my favourite student tomorrow...

1730
01:48:58,917 --> 01:49:00,709
Trying... David sir...

1731
01:49:00,959 --> 01:49:03,376
No trying vying Shashi.

1732
01:49:03,834 --> 01:49:06,334
Taking an exam is not
a matter of life and death...

1733
01:49:06,417 --> 01:49:10,917
it's about the joy of telling
yourself that you have done it.

1734
01:49:11,959 --> 01:49:13,292
Shashi madam...

1735
01:49:13,376 --> 01:49:15,292
last day of class...

1736
01:49:15,376 --> 01:49:17,126
we really miss you.

1737
01:49:18,917 --> 01:49:19,917
Speech ready no madam?

1738
01:49:20,001 --> 01:49:21,167
Coming tomorrow no madam?

1739
01:49:21,417 --> 01:49:23,876
The wedding is tomorrow...

1740
01:49:24,292 --> 01:49:25,834
No problem madam!

1741
01:49:26,167 --> 01:49:28,834
Tomorrow exam morning...

1742
01:49:28,917 --> 01:49:31,251
like that only you come...
like that only you go!

1743
01:49:31,792 --> 01:49:34,167
Shashi please come

1744
01:49:34,251 --> 01:49:36,334
I am failing tomorrow and I am here.

1745
01:49:37,876 --> 01:49:39,626
Shashi you must come...

1746
01:50:05,542 --> 01:50:07,917
One cup of coffee maybe?

1747
01:50:16,751 --> 01:50:20,667
Aunty... he really likes you!

1748
01:50:24,126 --> 01:50:27,917
Do you also...?

1749
01:50:28,667 --> 01:50:31,042
It's ok... it happens...

1750
01:50:31,751 --> 01:50:33,209
Radha...

1751
01:50:35,001 --> 01:50:37,001
I don't need love...

1752
01:50:38,584 --> 01:50:40,501
what I really need is...

1753
01:50:41,292 --> 01:50:43,501
some respect!

1754
01:50:46,126 --> 01:50:47,792
Will you help me...

1755
01:50:48,334 --> 01:50:49,709
one last time?

1756
01:50:51,834 --> 01:50:53,542
I want to take the exam tomorrow.

1757
01:50:56,709 --> 01:51:00,542
O listen... take care of her.

1758
01:51:00,959 --> 01:51:02,542
She is delicate blossom.

1759
01:51:02,626 --> 01:51:04,292
She is precious.

1760
01:51:04,376 --> 01:51:07,834
She is a rare one.

1761
01:51:08,292 --> 01:51:11,959
She is a rare one.

1762
01:51:12,876 --> 01:51:16,626
Come all dance along.

1763
01:51:16,959 --> 01:51:20,292
Let's drown in joy.

1764
01:51:20,376 --> 01:51:27,834
To this happy song.

1765
01:51:28,792 --> 01:51:32,542
Her eyes... they speak.

1766
01:51:32,959 --> 01:51:36,542
They tease... they sneak

1767
01:51:36,626 --> 01:51:40,542
into the world of dreams.

1768
01:51:40,917 --> 01:51:44,251
All bright and gold and green!

1769
01:51:44,334 --> 01:51:48,292
Here goes the shy blushing bride.

1770
01:51:48,376 --> 01:51:52,292
She sways to her beloved's charms.

1771
01:51:52,376 --> 01:51:55,501
Magic in her dark kohl eyes

1772
01:51:55,584 --> 01:51:57,167
I come to America...

1773
01:51:57,251 --> 01:51:58,917
I want to learn English...

1774
01:51:59,001 --> 01:52:01,126
To get a better job...

1775
01:52:01,542 --> 01:52:03,501
I want to learn better English...

1776
01:52:03,792 --> 01:52:04,876
to become the better person...

1777
01:52:04,959 --> 01:52:06,501
I can then go to college...

1778
01:52:06,584 --> 01:52:09,876
I didn't know why
I wanted to learn English...

1779
01:52:10,209 --> 01:52:11,459
Pakistani girl Chinese girl...

1780
01:52:11,542 --> 01:52:13,792

01:53:01,167 --> 01:53:02,792

1787
01:53:04,042 --> 01:53:07,167
- I wish mom had some of that talent.
- Yeah right!

1788
01:53:10,542 --> 01:53:11,501
Who do you fancy...

1789
01:53:11,584 --> 01:53:13,459
American guys or Indian?

1790
01:53:15,084 --> 01:53:16,709
Crap it's your mum...!

1791
01:53:17,334 --> 01:53:19,251
Chill... she won't understand.

1792
01:53:20,167 --> 01:53:21,459
So what's your boyfriend's name?

1793
01:53:21,542 --> 01:53:23,292
I don't have one... do you?

1794
01:53:23,376 --> 01:53:24,501
No...

1795
01:53:24,584 --> 01:53:26,417
Aunty its already 8.30.

1796
01:53:26,501 --> 01:53:28,834
Don't forget...

1797
01:53:29,959 --> 01:53:31,501
Let me help you with that.

1798
01:53:31,584 --> 01:53:33,792
Bring the other tray.

01:54:07,251 --> 01:54:09,084
Manu aunty... come quickly!

1800
01:54:09,376 --> 01:54:11,042
Where is Sagar?

1801
01:54:18,209 --> 01:54:21,667
Aunty... we can buy them
on the way back...

1802
01:54:22,751 --> 01:54:24,126
Yes Shashi...

1803
01:54:24,209 --> 01:54:26,417
there's an Indian
sweet shop near by...

1804
01:54:26,501 --> 01:54:28,167
don't worry...

1805
01:54:28,667 --> 01:54:31,501
Now no one will get to
taste Aunty's ladoos!

1806
01:54:31,751 --> 01:54:32,501
Come here.

1807
01:54:33,126 --> 01:54:34,876
How many times have
I told you to behave?

1808
01:54:34,959 --> 01:54:36,417
Didn't I warn you?

1809
01:54:36,751 --> 01:54:37,834
Will you do it again?

1810
01:54:37,917 --> 01:54:39,126
Will you?

1811
01:54:39,334 --> 01:54:41,417
Stop it

1812
01:54:46,334 --> 01:54:48,709
I will make fresh ladoos again...

1813
01:54:49,459 --> 01:54:50,959
All over again?

1814
01:54:51,542 --> 01:54:53,584
All that trouble again Shashi!

1815
01:54:54,834 --> 01:54:55,917

1816
01:54:56,667 --> 01:54:57,792

1817
01:55:03,959 --> 01:55:05,376
Excuse me...

1818
01:55:05,459 --> 01:55:07,126
Satish... I'll get it done.

1819
01:55:11,709 --> 01:55:14,001
It's ok... what to do!

1820
01:55:15,126 --> 01:55:16,501
Aunty...

1821
01:55:16,959 --> 01:55:18,459
we need to leave...

1822
01:55:20,334 --> 01:55:23,876
What's the point
if I fail in my favourite subject...

1823
01:55:23,959 --> 01:55:26,459
and pass in the other?

1824
01:57:34,042 --> 01:57:35,126
Satish look after them...

1825
01:57:36,292 --> 01:57:39,959
I've heard so much about
your wife's food... Iadoos?

1826
01:57:40,042 --> 01:57:42,001
She loves cooking...

1827
01:57:42,084 --> 01:57:43,834
And I love eating!

1828
01:57:44,626 --> 01:57:46,042
Thank you for coming.

1829
01:57:46,126 --> 01:57:47,542
Congratulations!

1830
01:57:49,001 --> 01:57:50,126
Hi Radha!

Thank you very very much

1837
01:58:03,667 --> 01:58:06,376
Can't understand

1838
01:58:06,751 --> 01:58:08,042
Where is Shashi?

1839

1845
01:58:21,626 --> 01:58:25,042

1846
01:58:25,334 --> 01:58:27,167
Shashi madam... we missed you today.

1847
01:58:27,376 --> 01:58:29,959
What a speech I gave...

1848
01:58:30,251 --> 01:58:31,459
What a speech!

1849
01:58:31,792 --> 01:58:33,751
I not understand one word.

1850
01:58:34,459 --> 01:58:37,417
Rama bhai also... superb English!

1851
01:58:37,501 --> 01:58:38,834
Don't call me Rama bhai...

1852
01:58:38,917 --> 01:58:41,251
that is my servant's name in India!

1853
01:58:42,667 --> 01:58:45,126
Oh Shashi you look so beautiful...

1854
01:58:45,209 --> 01:58:47,167
Thank you... you too!

1855
01:58:49,001 --> 01:58:50,334

1856
01:58:50,417 --> 01:58:52,709
Thank god Radha invited
all of us to the wedding

1857
01:58:52,792 --> 01:58:55,209
I couldn't let you
leave without meeting me.

1858
01:58:55,667 --> 01:58:57,584
Thank you so much for coming.

1859
01:58:57,792 --> 01:58:59,251
Shashi... what are you doing?

1860
01:58:59,334 --> 01:59:00,459
The wedding is about to begin...

1861
01:59:00,542 --> 01:59:01,917
Satish uncle...

1862
01:59:02,251 --> 01:59:04,959
Satish... this is David Sir...

1863
01:59:06,084 --> 01:59:07,542
Udumhke...

1864
01:59:08,042 --> 01:59:09,251
Eva...

1865
01:59:09,334 --> 01:59:11,084
Salman... Yu Son...

1866
01:59:11,584 --> 01:59:13,126
- Ramamurthy...
- Nice to meet you.

1867
01:59:13,834 --> 01:59:15,167
Laurent...

1868
01:59:15,376 --> 01:59:16,667
Nice to meet you.

1869
01:59:17,876 --> 01:59:19,501
They are my close friends.

1870
01:59:20,667 --> 01:59:22,709
Shashi, it's time for the ceremony.

1871
02:00:05,626 --> 02:00:09,501
To my darling daughter
Meera and my dear son Kevin...

1872
02:00:10,834 --> 02:00:12,667
How I wish Anil was here.

1873
02:00:14,792 --> 02:00:17,167
When Meera was going
through her troubled teens...

1874
02:00:17,376 --> 02:00:18,876
she was 14...

1875
02:00:19,917 --> 02:00:21,751
she was only 14 years old...

1876
02:00:22,626 --> 02:00:25,792
when she came in
fuming and asked us...

1877
02:00:26,459 --> 02:00:28,251
'Why did you give birth to me?'

1878
02:00:28,751 --> 02:00:31,126
She was so angry with life...

1879
02:00:31,626 --> 02:00:34,209
that she was furious
that we gave birth to her

1880
02:00:34,292 --> 02:00:36,709
without asking for her permission!

1881
02:00:41,334 --> 02:00:43,584
I will answer that today Meera.

1882
02:00:44,834 --> 02:00:46,626
You were horn...

1883
02:00:46,709 --> 02:00:49,792
so your dad and I could
share complete happiness.

1884
02:00:50,042 --> 02:00:53,126
"You were horn so you could
bring happiness into our lives..."

1885
02:00:53,209 --> 02:00:56,917
I am so sorry I didn't
take your permission.

1886
02:00:58,792 --> 02:01:00,751
Love you both sweethearts!

1887
02:01:00,834 --> 02:01:03,001
God bless both of you always.

1888
02:01:06,626 --> 02:01:09,459
Son... you just got lucky!

1889
02:01:10,876 --> 02:01:15,251
But fortune smiles on those
who embrace it's offerings...

1890
02:01:15,584 --> 02:01:17,501
so... love each other.

1891
02:01:18,417 --> 02:01:19,751
And son...

1892
02:01:19,834 --> 02:01:22,167
leave me and your mother alone!

1893
02:01:24,876 --> 02:01:27,501
It's time for us
to focus on each other.

1894
02:01:32,334 --> 02:01:35,042
Shashi Aunty... your turn.

1895
02:01:35,751 --> 02:01:37,751
Yes... come on.

1896
02:01:38,542 --> 02:01:39,751
Aunty.

1897
02:01:46,501 --> 02:01:50,584
Sorry... my wife's English is...

1898
02:01:50,792 --> 02:01:52,917
not very good so...

1899
02:01:56,459 --> 02:01:57,959
May I?

1900
02:02:15,834 --> 02:02:17,334
Meera...

1901
02:02:17,792 --> 02:02:19,292
Kevin...

1902
02:02:19,792 --> 02:02:21,584
this marriage is a...

1903
02:02:24,626 --> 02:02:26,751
Oops sorry... I started in Hindi.

1904
02:02:29,584 --> 02:02:33,501
This marriage is a

1905
02:02:35,709 --> 02:02:37,376
beautiful thing.

1906
02:02:38,834 --> 02:02:41,001
It is the most

1907
02:02:42,626 --> 02:02:45,251
special friendship...

1908
02:02:48,292 --> 02:02:51,542
friendship of two people

1909
02:02:51,792 --> 02:02:54,167
who are equal.

1910
02:02:56,042 --> 02:02:59,667
Life is a long journey.

1911
02:03:01,209 --> 02:03:04,626
Meera, sometimes you will feel

1912
02:03:05,042 --> 02:03:07,126
you are less

1913
02:03:07,876 --> 02:03:10,917
Kevin, sometimes you will also

1914
02:03:11,001 --> 02:03:14,084
feel you are less than Meera.

1915
02:03:16,459 --> 02:03:19,001
Try to help each other

1916
02:03:19,292 --> 02:03:22,042
to feel equal.

1917
02:03:22,417 --> 02:03:24,667
It will he nice.

1918
02:03:25,542 --> 02:03:27,334
Sometimes...

1919
02:03:27,917 --> 02:03:31,001
married couple don't even know

1920
02:03:31,251 --> 02:03:33,209
how the other is feeling.

1921
02:03:33,709 --> 02:03:38,209
So... how they will help the other?

1922
02:03:39,459 --> 02:03:42,792
It means marriage is finished?

1923
02:03:44,667 --> 02:03:46,001
No.

1924
02:03:46,292 --> 02:03:47,584
That is the time

1925
02:03:47,667 --> 02:03:49,417
you have to help yourself.

1926
02:03:51,876 --> 02:03:55,167
Nobody can help you better than you.

1927
02:03:56,126 --> 02:03:57,751
If you do that...

1928
02:03:58,417 --> 02:04:02,292
you will return back feeling equal

1929
02:04:03,126 --> 02:04:06,334
your friendship will return back...

1930
02:04:08,376 --> 02:04:10,501
your life will be beautiful.

1931
02:04:12,626 --> 02:04:14,792
Meera... Kevin...

1932
02:04:15,876 --> 02:04:19,917
maybe you'll very busy...

1933
02:04:20,792 --> 02:04:23,501
hut have family...

1934
02:04:23,751 --> 02:04:26,084
son... daughter...

1935
02:04:28,501 --> 02:04:30,959
in this big world...

1936
02:04:31,251 --> 02:04:34,042
your small little world.

1937
02:04:35,251 --> 02:04:38,209
It will make you feel so good.

1938
02:04:40,167 --> 02:04:41,834
Family...

1939
02:04:42,334 --> 02:04:47,167
family can never he...

1940
02:04:48,001 --> 02:04:49,709
never he judgemental!

1941
02:04:51,709 --> 02:04:54,084
Family will never...

1942
02:04:54,292 --> 02:04:55,792
put you down...

1943
02:04:55,876 --> 02:04:58,751
will never make you feel small.

1944
02:04:59,917 --> 02:05:02,001
Family is the only one

1945
02:05:02,084 --> 02:05:06,001
who will never laugh
at your weaknesses.

1946
02:05:08,542 --> 02:05:10,667
Family is the only place

1947
02:05:11,584 --> 02:05:13,834
where you will always get

1948
02:05:14,542 --> 02:05:16,792
love and respect.

1949
02:05:26,001 --> 02:05:28,042
That's all Meera and Kevin...

1950
02:05:28,667 --> 02:05:30,834
I wish you all the best.

1951
02:05:32,917 --> 02:05:34,376
Thank you.

1952
02:06:12,959 --> 02:06:14,501
Well Shashi...

1953
02:06:15,001 --> 02:06:17,834
you don't 'return back',
you just return...

1954
02:06:18,042 --> 02:06:22,042
and you missed a few
'a's and 'the's...

1955
02:06:23,167 --> 02:06:25,626
else you passed with distinction!

1956
02:06:32,042 --> 02:06:34,584
Shashi aunty you were amazing!

1957
02:06:35,042 --> 02:06:37,251
Yes... I'm so proud of you.

1958
02:06:37,876 --> 02:06:39,084
Do you want me to help?

1959
02:06:39,167 --> 02:06:40,459
Bring the other tray.

1960
02:06:45,501 --> 02:06:49,334
Next time you speak in
English in front of mama...

1961
02:06:49,417 --> 02:06:51,959
please think...
she can talk better than you!

1962
02:06:54,417 --> 02:06:56,584
David Sir... ladoo!

1963
02:06:58,584 --> 02:07:01,334
Thank you...
I have something for you!

1964
02:07:27,709 --> 02:07:32,042
When you don't like yourself...

1965
02:07:32,751 --> 02:07:36,751
you tend to dislike
everything connected to you.

1966
02:07:37,334 --> 02:07:40,209
New things seem to be more attractive.

1967
02:07:41,292 --> 02:07:45,667
When you learn to love yourself...

1968
02:07:46,209 --> 02:07:48,626
then the same old life...

1969
02:07:48,876 --> 02:07:50,876
starts looking new...

1970
02:07:51,876 --> 02:07:53,876
starts looking nice.

1971
02:07:54,709 --> 02:07:56,542
Thank you...

1972
02:07:56,959 --> 02:07:58,626
for teaching me...

1973
02:07:58,876 --> 02:08:01,042
how to love myself!

1974
02:08:06,459 --> 02:08:11,667
Thank you for making me...

1975
02:08:12,251 --> 02:08:14,542
feel good about myself.

1976
02:08:14,792 --> 02:08:16,459
Thank you so much!

1977
02:08:19,251 --> 02:08:21,001
Ladoo...

1978
02:08:34,584 --> 02:08:36,792
Broke the French heart, didn't you?

1979
02:08:42,626 --> 02:08:44,209
Shashi...

1980
02:08:44,667 --> 02:08:46,251
Do you...

1981
02:08:46,792 --> 02:08:49,001
still love me?

1982
02:08:52,417 --> 02:08:54,167
If I didn't...

1983
02:08:54,334 --> 02:08:56,459
why would I give you two ladoos?

1984
02:08:58,209 --> 02:08:59,834
And...

1985
02:09:00,167 --> 02:09:01,626
good choice!

1986
02:09:01,876 --> 02:09:05,417
Her eyes... they speak.

1987
02:09:06,126 --> 02:09:09,709
They tease... they sneak

1988
02:09:09,792 --> 02:09:13,667
into the world of dreams.

1989
02:09:14,126 --> 02:09:17,376
All bright and gold and green!

1990
02:09:17,459 --> 02:09:21,459
Here goes the shy blushing bride.

1991
02:09:21,542 --> 02:09:25,292
She sways to her beloved's charms.

1992
02:09:25,542 --> 02:09:29,376
Magic in her dark kohl eyes.

1993
02:10:14,751 --> 02:10:17,001
What newspaper would you like sir?

1994
02:10:17,292 --> 02:10:18,917
New York Times please.

1995
02:10:20,709 --> 02:10:22,042
And you ma'am?

1996
02:10:22,126 --> 02:10:23,584
The New York...

1997
02:10:23,917 --> 02:10:26,709
sorry... do you have
any Hindi newspaper?

1998
02:10:26,917 --> 02:10:28,251
No, sorry.

1999
02:10:28,542 --> 02:10:30,167
It's ok... thank you.
