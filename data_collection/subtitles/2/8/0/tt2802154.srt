1
00:01:17,328 --> 00:01:21,109
LEVIATHAN

2
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:26,544
I'll have a smoke outside,
or I'll fall asleep.

3
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,177
OK. I'll be quick.

4
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,440
There they are...

5
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,002
Not making your quota, Sergeant?

6
00:07:05,102 --> 00:07:06,602
Your license and registration.

7
00:07:06,735 --> 00:07:09,501
Polished your badge today?

8
00:07:12,968 --> 00:07:16,700
Stepanych will come see you today.
His carburettor broke again.

9
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,766
Again? I'm not a charity.

10
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:21,532
You know he'll make it up to you.

11
00:07:21,632 --> 00:07:24,032
I can buy my own damn vodka.

12
00:07:24,798 --> 00:07:25,898
Look,

13
00:07:26,631 --> 00:07:29,897
he said he'll cover everything
for our trip: petrol,

14
00:07:29,997 --> 00:07:31,130
food, guns.

15
00:07:31,264 --> 00:07:33,263
I'm so excited,
I could wet my pants!

16
00:07:33,396 --> 00:07:35,196
- Kolya...
- Pasha.

17
00:07:35,296 --> 00:07:37,729
- It'll only take a second.
- I'm serious.

18
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:40,062
I can't today.

19
00:07:40,162 --> 00:07:42,061
Tell him to come tomorrow.

20
00:07:43,627 --> 00:07:45,860
- I will.
- All right.

21
00:07:45,993 --> 00:07:47,360
Say hi to the wife.

22
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:59,390
I'm sick of that Stepanych
and his truck.

23
00:07:59,524 --> 00:08:00,790
Fucking cop...

24
00:08:02,723 --> 00:08:06,322
Cheap bastard is always after me
to fix his rust bucket.

25
00:08:06,822 --> 00:08:10,322
He can crawl around
underneath it himself.

26
00:08:11,155 --> 00:08:14,987
Any corrupt traffic cop can afford
a good car after 5 years on the job.

27
00:08:15,121 --> 00:08:16,720
Maybe he's an honest cop.

28
00:08:16,854 --> 00:08:18,986
Yeah, and generous!

29
00:08:33,183 --> 00:08:35,050
- Are they here yet?
- Nope.

30
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,247
And where's your "good morning"?

31
00:08:50,913 --> 00:08:52,412
I don't know.

32
00:08:54,012 --> 00:08:55,678
Look for it, then.

33
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:57,645
Where?

34
00:09:01,644 --> 00:09:04,810
Did you wash?
Go on, don't be an ape.

35
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,809
You're the ape.

36
00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:09,075
What?

37
00:09:09,975 --> 00:09:11,042
Nothing.

38
00:09:14,908 --> 00:09:17,207
- Stop right there.
- Get lost.

39
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,973
- What did you say?
- Just what you heard.

40
00:09:22,006 --> 00:09:23,306
Oh! They're here.

41
00:09:42,202 --> 00:09:45,901
Dima, tell them to take me along.

42
00:09:46,867 --> 00:09:50,534
What about school?
You have a test coming up. Go get ready.

43
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:51,700
Don't lie...

44
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,865
- Don't talk to your mum like that!
- She's not my mum!

45
00:10:07,796 --> 00:10:09,596
Difficult age...

46
00:10:10,396 --> 00:10:11,729
You shouldn't hit him.

47
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:13,995
Just an affectionate slap.

48
00:10:14,095 --> 00:10:16,361
I'm not driving him to school today.

49
00:10:16,494 --> 00:10:19,327
He's been rude to me all morning.

50
00:10:20,393 --> 00:10:22,859
I can't either. My friend's here.

51
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:27,226
He's your son. Up to you
whether he becomes a man or an ape.

52
00:10:28,658 --> 00:10:30,558
Does he really have a test today?

53
00:10:31,425 --> 00:10:32,557
Yes.

54
00:10:33,857 --> 00:10:36,990
Kolya, just take him.
I can come along too.

55
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,356
He'd like that.

56
00:10:48,287 --> 00:10:51,353
Hey, soldier of fortune,
you ready to go?

57
00:10:57,252 --> 00:10:58,752
How've you been?

58
00:10:58,852 --> 00:11:00,085
All right.

59
00:11:04,717 --> 00:11:06,650
We're looking for a new place.

60
00:11:08,183 --> 00:11:10,649
I've been saying
we should move out of town.

61
00:11:11,749 --> 00:11:14,248
Away from this place.
He says nothing.

62
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:17,315
- Could you talk to him?
- Sure.

63
00:11:17,415 --> 00:11:18,881
Can't I just wear it?

64
00:11:19,014 --> 00:11:21,047
Give it back, Dad.

65
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,580
All right, I'll give it back.
Stop whining.

66
00:11:23,713 --> 00:11:24,713
Thank you.

67
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:29,878
Go start the car.

68
00:11:29,978 --> 00:11:31,378
You're driving.

69
00:11:31,512 --> 00:11:32,644
Alone?

70
00:11:33,211 --> 00:11:35,577
You wish.

71
00:11:35,711 --> 00:11:38,010
Dima and I are coming too.

72
00:11:39,776 --> 00:11:42,209
- But I'm driving, right?
- Yes, you.

73
00:11:46,775 --> 00:11:48,174
Time out!

74
00:11:54,873 --> 00:11:56,873
My own fault for coaching him.

75
00:11:59,206 --> 00:12:01,805
A couple more years,
and he'll knock you out cold.

76
00:12:02,738 --> 00:12:04,205
It's all good.

77
00:12:09,903 --> 00:12:12,069
- I love you.
- I know.

78
00:12:17,368 --> 00:12:19,301
Don't let him drive too fast!

79
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:44,396
Hello.

80
00:12:44,496 --> 00:12:47,362
Hi. Kolya's taking Roma to school.

81
00:12:47,462 --> 00:12:48,861
Come in. He'll be back soon.

82
00:12:48,961 --> 00:12:54,194
That's OK, I'll wait out here
and have a smoke.

83
00:13:47,949 --> 00:13:49,348
Hello, Kolya.

84
00:13:49,482 --> 00:13:51,514
Hey there. Car troubles again?

85
00:13:52,681 --> 00:13:55,313
Didn't Pasha tell you
that I can't today?

86
00:13:55,413 --> 00:13:56,880
No. Why, what's up?

87
00:13:57,013 --> 00:13:59,680
My friend is visiting from Moscow.

88
00:13:59,812 --> 00:14:01,512
My court hearing is at noon,

89
00:14:01,612 --> 00:14:04,879
and we still have
a few things to go over.

90
00:14:08,544 --> 00:14:10,144
I'll do it tomorrow.

91
00:14:10,244 --> 00:14:11,577
Come by in the morning.

92
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:12,877
Tomorrow?

93
00:14:13,977 --> 00:14:15,809
- I'm Ivan Stepanych.
- Dima.

94
00:14:15,909 --> 00:14:18,508
I promise. I'll fix her up -
good as new.

95
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,908
OK, Kolya, fair enough.

96
00:14:22,008 --> 00:14:23,807
Tomorrow it is then.

97
00:14:27,574 --> 00:14:29,040
He wasn't happy about that.

98
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:33,572
- Funny character.
- You think?

99
00:14:34,172 --> 00:14:36,838
He's outlived two wives.

100
00:14:36,972 --> 00:14:38,304
Fucking tyrant.

101
00:14:41,237 --> 00:14:43,237
OK, my friends.

102
00:14:45,236 --> 00:14:47,736
Over the last two months,
I dug up some dirt

103
00:14:48,369 --> 00:14:49,869
on that bastard.

104
00:14:50,002 --> 00:14:51,435
Got him by the balls?

105
00:14:51,535 --> 00:14:53,501
Yep, it'll do some damage.

106
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:57,467
- Doesn't look like much.
- So what now, how does it help?

107
00:14:57,567 --> 00:14:58,900
Here's the deal:

108
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,999
I think today's ruling
won't be in our favour...

109
00:15:02,099 --> 00:15:04,998
- Don't write us off yet.
- But...

110
00:15:05,465 --> 00:15:09,297
We need him to think
what's best for him:

111
00:15:09,431 --> 00:15:11,231
settle with us, or we go public.

112
00:15:11,364 --> 00:15:13,364
- Meaning?
- Kolya, let him finish.

113
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:17,329
I want to know what he found.
A cannon can't bring that prick down!

114
00:15:17,429 --> 00:15:19,429
No need for cannons.

115
00:15:19,562 --> 00:15:21,895
We'll just gently tug him

116
00:15:21,995 --> 00:15:23,194
by the balls.

117
00:15:23,328 --> 00:15:26,594
I don't believe in that approach.
We've got to crush him.

118
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,027
- With a sledgehammer!
- No.

119
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,460
Only a subtle approach
works with his kind.

120
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,759
This here is our leverage. Facts.

121
00:15:34,859 --> 00:15:37,325
- Let me see.
- Not just yet.

122
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:38,991
After the hearing.

123
00:15:40,424 --> 00:15:41,790
- Why's that?
- Kolya...

124
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:44,590
Because you're a hothead.
No offense,

125
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:47,456
but you ca fly off the handle
just like that.

126
00:15:47,556 --> 00:15:50,356
And the last thing we need now
is a scandal.

127
00:15:51,088 --> 00:15:53,188
Come on. I'm not crazy.

128
00:15:53,288 --> 00:15:57,454
I have to know. You think
I'll just blurt out everything in court?

129
00:15:57,554 --> 00:16:00,320
- Do you trust me, bro?
- Of course.

130
00:16:00,454 --> 00:16:02,986
Then don't question me -
read it after.

131
00:16:04,485 --> 00:16:07,718
Lilya, how about some tea?

132
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:17,816
Well, all right. I'll read it after.

133
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:19,649
Good man.

134
00:16:20,316 --> 00:16:23,881
But you know,
you're bossing me around, junior.

135
00:16:24,015 --> 00:16:25,715
And I don't like it.

136
00:16:26,248 --> 00:16:29,780
Kolya, "junior" is what I was
in the army 20 years ago.

137
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,013
Why are you

138
00:16:31,147 --> 00:16:34,279
waving these papers in my face then?

139
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:37,678
See for yourself then, chief.

140
00:16:37,778 --> 00:16:41,845
Well, I've heard things about him.
Who hasn't, around here?

141
00:16:42,577 --> 00:16:44,844
He's got blood dripping...

142
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,410
from his hands.

143
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:51,309
So why isn't he in prison
if you've got all this documented?

144
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:54,075
Because somebody up top needs him.

145
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,374
They've got all of them by the balls.

146
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:59,341
Easier to manage that way.
It's all very simple.

147
00:17:00,073 --> 00:17:02,940
Vadim's position is safe

148
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,906
as long as he serves his purpose.

149
00:17:05,006 --> 00:17:06,139
Or until he dies.

150
00:17:06,272 --> 00:17:08,439
Or until someone lynches him.

151
00:17:08,539 --> 00:17:11,171
Give me a break.
Who's going to lynch him?

152
00:17:11,305 --> 00:17:13,104
You guys coming or what?

153
00:17:13,671 --> 00:17:15,904
So let him sleep. Come alone.

154
00:17:19,003 --> 00:17:20,469
I see.

155
00:17:22,002 --> 00:17:24,202
If there's no one
to watch him, fine.

156
00:17:25,768 --> 00:17:28,467
I know.
I've just got other things on my mind.

157
00:17:29,634 --> 00:17:31,000
I'll talk to you later.

158
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:33,034
So what? Not coming?

159
00:17:33,134 --> 00:17:36,833
Pasha is asleep after his shift.
There's no one to watch the kid.

160
00:17:36,966 --> 00:17:39,865
Last time they had an excuse too.
Some friends!

161
00:17:39,965 --> 00:17:42,232
- What about yours?
- Mine are right here.

162
00:17:42,998 --> 00:17:44,964
OK, Kolya, you win.

163
00:17:46,931 --> 00:17:48,697
My friends are shit.

164
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,596
- Sure are!
- Stop it, please.

165
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:53,662
Kolya, get a grip.
Watch your driving.

166
00:17:53,795 --> 00:17:55,429
My driving!

167
00:17:55,561 --> 00:17:56,761
Lilya...

168
00:17:57,528 --> 00:17:58,794
I'm not saying anything.

169
00:18:21,123 --> 00:18:25,722
Decree No. 1295 of the Pribrezhny
Town Administration

170
00:18:25,822 --> 00:18:31,354
ordered the seizure from Mr Sergeyev
of a land parcel of 0.66 acres

171
00:18:31,487 --> 00:18:34,553
cadastral number 28:136:254:2001,

172
00:18:34,653 --> 00:18:36,620
along with the residential building,

173
00:18:36,753 --> 00:18:39,552
automotive works shed,
repair garage and greenhouse.

174
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:44,018
Mr Sergeyev petitioned the Zagorye
District Court to repeal this Decree.

175
00:18:44,151 --> 00:18:47,118
The Court ruled to deny the petition.

176
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:52,383
Mr Sergeyev then petitioned
Pribrezhny Town Court to appeal.

177
00:18:52,516 --> 00:18:56,182
During proceedings, Mr Sergeyev
insisted the court ruling be revoked.

178
00:18:56,316 --> 00:18:59,315
The Town Administration
rejected the appeal

179
00:18:59,448 --> 00:19:02,481
and upheld the ruling
of the Zagorye District Court.

180
00:19:02,614 --> 00:19:05,646
Mr Sergeyev states the initial ruling
violated procedural regulations

181
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:10,213
and therefore disputes the conclusion
that the seizure of the land parcel

182
00:19:10,379 --> 00:19:12,145
is lawful.

183
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:17,744
He says the Administration did not
meet the deadline for notifying him

184
00:19:17,844 --> 00:19:21,610
and violated the procedure
for determining the purchase price.

185
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:24,342
He also contends
that, when determining the price,

186
00:19:24,476 --> 00:19:29,208
the court did not consider
an independent evaluation he submitted,

187
00:19:29,308 --> 00:19:31,608
which values the property higher
than determined by the Administration.

188
00:19:31,741 --> 00:19:33,940
Me also states
that the Administration

189
00:19:34,074 --> 00:19:36,973
violated civil law.

190
00:19:37,107 --> 00:19:42,872
Mr Sergeyev was not notified
of the upcoming seizure a year in advance

191
00:19:42,972 --> 00:19:45,705
due to which he incurred expenses
related to improving his property.

192
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:49,737
Also, the purchase price did not consider
his loss of business revenue

193
00:19:49,837 --> 00:19:55,203
as well as his liabilities
to third parties.

194
00:19:55,303 --> 00:19:58,402
The Court ruled: by Decree No. 1295
pf Pribrezhny Town Administration,

195
00:19:58,535 --> 00:20:04,267
the land parcel shall be seized
to build a town communications centre.

196
00:20:04,367 --> 00:20:08,633
The Decree determines the purchase
price of the land and structures

197
00:20:08,766 --> 00:20:11,399
as 639,540.27 roubles.

198
00:20:11,499 --> 00:20:14,099
The purchase price was determined
based on an evaluation.

199
00:20:14,199 --> 00:20:18,398
Per Mr Sergeyev's request,
Alliance Ltd estimated the value

200
00:20:18,498 --> 00:20:21,364
of liabilities
for the loss of agricultural production

201
00:20:21,464 --> 00:20:26,296
due to the seizure of the land parcel
of 0.66 acres for the town's needs.

202
00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:31,028
The market value of the liabilities
constitutes 3.5 million roubles.

203
00:20:31,195 --> 00:20:32,228
The court questions...

204
00:20:45,292 --> 00:20:47,324
...and deems it invalid.

205
00:20:47,424 --> 00:20:51,057
The Court upholds the purchase price
of 639,540.27 roubles

206
00:20:51,157 --> 00:20:54,390
as determined
by the Town Administration's evaluation.

207
00:20:54,523 --> 00:20:59,422
The Court rejects the statement that
the purchase procedure was violated.

208
00:20:59,522 --> 00:21:02,488
The case file contains letters

209
00:21:02,621 --> 00:21:07,320
about the purchase and testimony
of Town Administration officials

210
00:21:07,454 --> 00:21:09,587
stating that Mr Sergeyev

211
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:13,486
had been notified
of the seizure of the land parcel.

212
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:16,718
The Court casts doubt
on Mr Sergeyev's claims

213
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:18,585
that he didn't receive
these notifications.

214
00:21:18,718 --> 00:21:25,216
Having examined Mr Sergeyev's appeal,
Pribrezhny Town Court has concluded

215
00:21:25,316 --> 00:21:29,749
that Mr Sergeyev failed to establish
grounds to repeal the court ruling

216
00:21:29,882 --> 00:21:33,648
pursuant to article 330
of the Civil Procedural Code.

217
00:21:33,782 --> 00:21:39,747
As per articles 320-335 of the Civil
Procedural Code, the court denies

218
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:44,279
Mr Sergeyev's petition to revoke
the ruling of the Zagorye District Court.

219
00:21:44,412 --> 00:21:48,945
That ruling is upheld,
and Mr Sergeyev's appeal is denied.

220
00:21:49,078 --> 00:21:51,311
The ruling
shall come into effect forthwith.

221
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:05,807
Well, shall we go?

222
00:22:06,774 --> 00:22:08,041
In a minute.

223
00:23:08,927 --> 00:23:11,360
Vadim, every time you come,

224
00:23:11,493 --> 00:23:13,793
all you do
is worry about the election.

225
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:15,926
It's not for another year.

226
00:23:16,492 --> 00:23:18,692
In fair weather, prepare for foul.

227
00:23:20,425 --> 00:23:23,624
You do well to tend

228
00:23:23,724 --> 00:23:25,457
to worldly matters,

229
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:27,957
but remember the divine.

230
00:23:28,057 --> 00:23:29,389
But I...

231
00:23:30,923 --> 00:23:31,922
Don't I already?

232
00:23:32,056 --> 00:23:33,488
I know.

233
00:23:35,055 --> 00:23:36,888
You're a most...

234
00:23:37,921 --> 00:23:39,387
charitable patron.

235
00:23:40,054 --> 00:23:43,820
Even today, you come from afar,
bearing gifts.

236
00:23:46,153 --> 00:23:47,885
Have some fish.

237
00:23:49,952 --> 00:23:51,152
Right.

238
00:23:53,651 --> 00:23:55,551
I'm telling you,

239
00:23:56,751 --> 00:23:58,750
don't worry so much.

240
00:23:58,883 --> 00:24:01,216
All power comes from God.

241
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,682
As long as God wishes for it,
you need not worry.

242
00:24:04,915 --> 00:24:06,815
And does He?

243
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:13,213
Who can I ask if not you?
You're the priest!

244
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,479
He does.

245
00:24:20,046 --> 00:24:22,112
Chase it with some food.

246
00:24:39,074 --> 00:24:40,341
Hello.

247
00:24:41,707 --> 00:24:44,307
Yes. Thank God, finally.

248
00:24:45,073 --> 00:24:49,906
Get Tyagunov's guys on it.

249
00:24:51,871 --> 00:24:53,705
Why wait?

250
00:24:54,138 --> 00:24:57,570
Tear down that bastard's
fucking place already!

251
00:24:58,337 --> 00:25:01,269
We've lost so much time
because of him.

252
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:06,668
How's that your fault?
Drop the excuses!

253
00:25:09,068 --> 00:25:10,835
OK, later.

254
00:25:11,401 --> 00:25:13,734
Lyosha, get my thing...

255
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,533
from the glove compartment.

256
00:25:38,561 --> 00:25:40,695
Hey, Vasya.

257
00:25:41,161 --> 00:25:44,660
Let's pay that fucking arsehole...

258
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,060
a visit real quick.

259
00:25:47,693 --> 00:25:49,526
The one at the bottom of the hill.

260
00:25:49,659 --> 00:25:51,792
- Past the bridge?
- Yes.

261
00:25:51,892 --> 00:25:54,658
There are lots of arseholes
at the bottom of hills.

262
00:25:55,491 --> 00:25:56,757
What?

263
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:01,124
You trying to be smart now?

264
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:05,523
It's obvious that the prick
wants this place

265
00:26:05,656 --> 00:26:07,922
so he can build himself a palace!

266
00:26:08,055 --> 00:26:09,755
Calm down. That's enough.

267
00:26:09,855 --> 00:26:12,488
I built this place with my own hands!

268
00:26:20,186 --> 00:26:21,852
Here we go again.

269
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:24,385
Kolya...

270
00:26:42,515 --> 00:26:43,647
Here.

271
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,213
My whole life is here.

272
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:54,512
My grandfather lived here.
And my father...

273
00:26:55,012 --> 00:26:56,212
He's seen it before.

274
00:26:56,345 --> 00:26:58,144
Stay out of this!

275
00:26:58,244 --> 00:26:59,411
Stop yelling!

276
00:26:59,511 --> 00:27:01,111
Kolya, calm down.

277
00:27:16,274 --> 00:27:17,707
Come on, Dima.

278
00:27:19,073 --> 00:27:20,439
Let's have a drink.

279
00:27:32,537 --> 00:27:33,804
Here's to you.

280
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,536
All right.

281
00:27:44,401 --> 00:27:47,701
- To everything you've done for us.
- If you say so, bro.

282
00:27:50,067 --> 00:27:51,400
Thank you.

283
00:27:53,566 --> 00:27:55,066
Thank you.

284
00:27:55,199 --> 00:27:58,265
What are you talking about?
It'll be fine.

285
00:27:58,365 --> 00:27:59,931
But that dirt of yours...

286
00:28:00,098 --> 00:28:03,264
Kolya, that's not my fucking dirt.
It's his.

287
00:28:05,863 --> 00:28:07,396
All I'm saying is,

288
00:28:07,529 --> 00:28:09,662
I don't see a way

289
00:28:10,962 --> 00:28:13,861
to put your theory to work.

290
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:19,127
Either way,
they're knocking this place down.

291
00:28:20,826 --> 00:28:27,192
We'll buy that crappy apartment
near Angela's

292
00:28:27,325 --> 00:28:29,892
with that 639,000 roubles
and 27 kopecks

293
00:28:31,724 --> 00:28:33,857
and I'll become a cop, like Pasha.

294
00:28:34,691 --> 00:28:35,090
Oh no...

295
00:28:37,456 --> 00:28:38,856
Listen, bro,

296
00:28:39,722 --> 00:28:42,989
this is not like you.

297
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:45,488
You hear me?

298
00:28:47,821 --> 00:28:51,253
You've never let problems
get to you before.

299
00:28:51,387 --> 00:28:53,686
What's the matter with you?

300
00:28:55,552 --> 00:29:00,585
Things were different.
We're not 20 anymore.

301
00:29:01,085 --> 00:29:03,184
The years take their toll.

302
00:29:03,317 --> 00:29:05,084
Anyway, what are you on about?

303
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,716
Are you a shrink now?

304
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:11,949
I'm no fucking shrink.

305
00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:14,248
But fuck, man, it's like...

306
00:29:14,682 --> 00:29:18,981
You can look
at this situation differently.

307
00:29:19,114 --> 00:29:20,313
How is that?

308
00:29:20,447 --> 00:29:22,613
Fucking hell...

309
00:29:22,713 --> 00:29:24,013
You're my brother!

310
00:29:24,146 --> 00:29:27,312
Take on the challenge,
for fuck's sake!

311
00:29:27,412 --> 00:29:29,412
It's a fresh start!

312
00:29:30,578 --> 00:29:34,044
Easy for you to say.
You're off to Moscow tomorrow...

313
00:29:34,178 --> 00:29:38,643
What's Moscow got to do with it?
Come with me then. You hear me?

314
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,143
Why not?

315
00:29:40,276 --> 00:29:41,842
- To Moscow?
- Sure.

316
00:29:41,909 --> 00:29:44,242
Pack your bags.

317
00:29:45,475 --> 00:29:49,007
Rent a studio apartment
for starters, for about 30,000.

318
00:29:49,507 --> 00:29:50,574
Oh, wow!

319
00:29:50,674 --> 00:29:52,474
What? That's a fair price.

320
00:29:53,206 --> 00:29:57,573
A fucking genius handyman like you
won't have any problems finding work!

321
00:29:57,673 --> 00:30:00,438
With your hands, you'll be all right.

322
00:30:00,572 --> 00:30:03,204
We'll find something for Lilya, too.

323
00:30:03,338 --> 00:30:06,771
Maybe in some shop at first.

324
00:30:07,371 --> 00:30:11,370
Anything is better than cleaning fish
at that stinking fish farm.

325
00:30:12,036 --> 00:30:14,535
What's the matter with you, bro?

326
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,934
What about Roma?

327
00:30:22,034 --> 00:30:24,700
What about him? He'll go to school.

328
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,799
He's a kid. He goes to school!

329
00:30:26,899 --> 00:30:28,632
Sort of...

330
00:30:29,732 --> 00:30:32,265
He's barely a C-student.
Who will take him?

331
00:30:32,365 --> 00:30:35,597
They're required to.
They'll take him.

332
00:30:36,197 --> 00:30:37,264
Kolya!

333
00:30:37,364 --> 00:30:40,263
I'm not a C-student. I get Bs.

334
00:30:40,396 --> 00:30:41,696
Don't get worked up.

335
00:30:41,796 --> 00:30:44,263
What are you doing listening to us?

336
00:30:44,363 --> 00:30:47,128
Why would I do that?
I just went to the toilet.

337
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,662
Come over here then!

338
00:30:49,661 --> 00:30:51,294
Come on.

339
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:02,525
What's up guys? You need help?

340
00:31:03,191 --> 00:31:05,491
Kolya, don't you recognise authority

341
00:31:06,324 --> 00:31:08,390
when you see it?

342
00:31:10,257 --> 00:31:12,356
And what do you want, "Authority"?

343
00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:14,956
Just all of this.

344
00:31:16,922 --> 00:31:18,322
Come and get it.

345
00:31:18,821 --> 00:31:20,655
Will it all fit

346
00:31:20,787 --> 00:31:22,554
into your hearse?

347
00:31:23,887 --> 00:31:25,320
What else?

348
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,653
You're all insects.

349
00:31:31,552 --> 00:31:34,384
You always have to make things
difficult, don't you?

350
00:31:35,818 --> 00:31:39,383
That's way you're all drowning in shit.

351
00:31:39,517 --> 00:31:41,550
Kolya,

352
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,582
have you packed your suitcases?

353
00:31:44,716 --> 00:31:48,615
Look, sir, it's you
who's not supposed to be here now.

354
00:31:48,749 --> 00:31:51,714
The court ruling
hasn't taken effect yet.

355
00:31:52,814 --> 00:31:56,613
And your office doesn't entitle you
to come here. Do you have a warrant?

356
00:31:57,447 --> 00:31:58,946
Who are you?

357
00:31:59,046 --> 00:32:00,379
Dmitri Seleznev,

358
00:32:00,979 --> 00:32:04,112
Moscow Bar Association.

359
00:32:04,245 --> 00:32:07,211
Kolya's lawyer in litigation
with your gang.

360
00:32:08,611 --> 00:32:13,510
Oh, yeah, I heard someone
babbling about that.

361
00:32:13,643 --> 00:32:18,242
So what's up, Kolya?
Can't stand up for yourself anymore?

362
00:32:18,342 --> 00:32:20,608
Ignore him, man.
Take it easy, Kolya.

363
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:24,774
I'll stand up to you, bitch.

364
00:32:25,907 --> 00:32:29,506
Please, no more, I just shit myself.

365
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,572
Scary stuff.

366
00:32:32,905 --> 00:32:34,905
- Sir...
- OK.

367
00:32:36,071 --> 00:32:39,438
Maybe I just wanted to have
a friendly drink with you.

368
00:32:40,804 --> 00:32:43,203
By the way, where is it?
Give it here.

369
00:32:44,203 --> 00:32:45,503
Want some?

370
00:32:46,269 --> 00:32:47,302
No?

371
00:32:47,936 --> 00:32:49,036
Guess not.

372
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:53,135
I'm not gonna offer him any.
I don't like his kind.

373
00:32:54,367 --> 00:32:58,600
Anyway, I wanted to tell you
something to bear in mind.

374
00:32:58,733 --> 00:33:00,699
Lilya, call the police.

375
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,899
Go ahead, Lilya, call them!

376
00:33:03,999 --> 00:33:06,198
The police. Do it.

377
00:33:07,298 --> 00:33:09,598
What's your name, kid?

378
00:33:09,731 --> 00:33:12,930
Listen, Vadim,
why are you doing this?

379
00:33:13,063 --> 00:33:15,463
You're not so drunk
that you don't know...

380
00:33:15,596 --> 00:33:18,929
Shut your mouth, you courtroom rat.

381
00:33:19,062 --> 00:33:21,861
And you, listen up.

382
00:33:21,961 --> 00:33:24,228
- Fuck off.
- Remember my face!

383
00:33:24,361 --> 00:33:25,860
Ignore him, bro.

384
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,727
You piece of shit.

385
00:33:28,593 --> 00:33:32,693
You've never had any fucking rights

386
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:36,058
and never will!

387
00:33:37,058 --> 00:33:38,525
Where the fuck are you going?

388
00:33:39,025 --> 00:33:42,557
Listen, it would be best
if you go now.

389
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:47,323
You are trespassing.

390
00:33:47,456 --> 00:33:50,055
And the owners are not happy
to see you.

391
00:33:50,222 --> 00:33:52,855
Vadim, let's not escalate the situation.

392
00:33:52,955 --> 00:33:54,654
What did you just say?

393
00:33:55,588 --> 00:33:57,354
I'm the owner.

394
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:00,953
- Got it?
- Got it. I've got it.

395
00:34:01,086 --> 00:34:03,519
Let's talk about that tomorrow.

396
00:34:04,052 --> 00:34:05,252
Tomorrow.

397
00:34:05,352 --> 00:34:07,785
We have some business to discuss.

398
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,018
Ivan has told me a lot about you.

399
00:34:15,283 --> 00:34:18,549
Ivan who?

400
00:34:18,683 --> 00:34:20,349
Ivan Kostrov.

401
00:34:21,348 --> 00:34:23,682
From the Committee. Kostrov.

402
00:34:25,281 --> 00:34:28,880
Just because we can't see them,
doesn't mean they're not there.

403
00:34:31,146 --> 00:34:34,646
Anyway, I'm tired of you all...

404
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:37,345
So what about tomorrow?

405
00:34:38,345 --> 00:34:39,512
Tomorrow.

406
00:34:42,044 --> 00:34:44,677
Between 3 and 5pm.

407
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:48,942
Office hours for constituent issues.

408
00:34:51,042 --> 00:34:52,875
I'm all right. I'm all right.

409
00:35:09,105 --> 00:35:11,605
Kolya, are you going out hunting
or something?

410
00:35:13,604 --> 00:35:15,170
Give me that.

411
00:35:16,604 --> 00:35:18,203
Bro,

412
00:35:18,303 --> 00:35:23,402
tomorrow we'll write a statement
about his abuse of office.

413
00:35:23,502 --> 00:35:25,602
We'll tear him to bits, Kolya!

414
00:35:25,702 --> 00:35:26,834
Dima...

415
00:35:29,067 --> 00:35:31,067
I won't go to Moscow.

416
00:35:32,067 --> 00:35:33,733
I'm staying here.

417
00:35:36,332 --> 00:35:37,666
Let's drink.

418
00:35:43,764 --> 00:35:47,630
"The actions of Vadim Shelevyat
caused great harm to my family.

419
00:35:48,263 --> 00:35:52,029
"He was not authorised to implement

420
00:35:52,129 --> 00:35:55,195

"and, pending evidence,

426
00:36:12,924 --> 00:36:14,658
Take that, arsehole.

427
00:36:34,553 --> 00:36:36,186
Here's another one, Kolya.

428
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,553
What?

429
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:38,852
Look.

430
00:36:39,386 --> 00:36:43,818
"Darwin's term for directional
and irreversible historical

431
00:36:43,918 --> 00:36:46,351
"development of life."

9 letters.

433
00:36:50,283 --> 00:36:53,449
A prolonged leap
from the twat to the grave.

434
00:36:53,883 --> 00:36:56,815
What's with the swearing,
Sergeant Potty Mouth?

435
00:36:59,048 --> 00:37:01,914
- Takes one to know one.
- Sure does.

436
00:37:03,181 --> 00:37:05,680
"E-vo-lu-tion."

437
00:37:06,313 --> 00:37:07,546
It fits.

438
00:37:10,912 --> 00:37:11,979
Good morning.

439
00:37:14,011 --> 00:37:15,778
Are you almost done?

440
00:37:15,911 --> 00:37:17,178
Yeah, yeah.

441
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:19,444
Another half hour or so.

442
00:37:20,543 --> 00:37:23,443
I've written it.
Just sign it, and we'll be off.

443
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,176
Dima!

444
00:37:28,008 --> 00:37:31,774
I'm not sure if Kolya told you,
but I just had a birthday.

445
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:32,907
Happy birthday.

446
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:36,840
So I invite you to join us tomorrow.

447
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,406
Campfire, kebabs, vodka,
a bit of shooting...

448
00:37:39,539 --> 00:37:41,172
My treat.

449
00:37:41,272 --> 00:37:43,172
Shooting - as in, hunting?

450
00:37:43,305 --> 00:37:44,938
Of course not.

451
00:37:45,604 --> 00:37:47,371
We're going with women and kids.

452
00:37:48,037 --> 00:37:51,570
We'll just do
a little target practice, for fun.

453
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:53,470
Is it far?

454
00:37:53,603 --> 00:37:55,136
Hundred kilometers or so.

455
00:37:55,236 --> 00:37:57,702
We'll leave early, hit the booze,

456
00:37:57,802 --> 00:38:00,435
shoot a little and come back.

457
00:38:01,634 --> 00:38:03,500
- I'd love to.
- Excellent.

458
00:38:04,834 --> 00:38:06,167
Kolya, I'm ready when you are.

459
00:38:13,298 --> 00:38:14,532
Pardon me?

460
00:38:14,632 --> 00:38:15,698
Are you the victim?

461
00:38:16,198 --> 00:38:18,997
No, Mr Sergeyev is the victim.
I'm his lawyer.

462
00:38:32,461 --> 00:38:33,694
Off he goes.

463
00:38:34,361 --> 00:38:36,393
Reporting to his superiors.

464
00:38:45,425 --> 00:38:47,524
Lilya, got any water?

465
00:38:55,356 --> 00:38:57,689
I have a feeling he won't accept it.

466
00:38:58,522 --> 00:39:00,755
- Can he do that?
- Sure.

467
00:39:00,888 --> 00:39:03,055
Even though he has to by law.

468
00:39:03,155 --> 00:39:04,887
So what then?

469
00:39:05,021 --> 00:39:08,054
We go to the prosecutor's office,
And then court.

470
00:39:08,186 --> 00:39:10,619
If necessary, we'll file a complaint
about this guy too.

471
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:12,719
We'll need all the facts,
even the minor ones.

472
00:39:12,853 --> 00:39:15,185
Are you going to fight
the whole town?

473
00:39:16,185 --> 00:39:18,851
These animals are not
the whole town.

474
00:39:18,951 --> 00:39:21,517
Kolya, you know what I mean.

475
00:39:22,351 --> 00:39:24,417
Where did our lieutenant go?

476
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:25,850
Just wait.

477
00:39:30,715 --> 00:39:32,848
Hey there, lieutenant!
Where are you?

478
00:39:32,948 --> 00:39:34,781
Sir, calm down!

479
00:39:34,881 --> 00:39:36,380
What's this racket?

480
00:39:36,514 --> 00:39:37,847
Everything's OK.

481
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,447
- I'm not talking to you.
- Will it be long?

482
00:39:40,547 --> 00:39:42,613
What's this behaviour?

483
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,779
Why are you making trouble?

484
00:39:45,378 --> 00:39:47,045
Detain this one.

485
00:39:47,178 --> 00:39:49,111
Put him in custody!
Take him to a cell.

486
00:39:57,176 --> 00:40:00,942
The prosecutor is not here,
and I'm not authorised.

487
00:40:01,042 --> 00:40:02,475
I can't accept your statement.

488
00:40:02,575 --> 00:40:05,741
And there's not a soul
in the entire office besides you?

489
00:40:05,841 --> 00:40:07,807
No one who is authorised.

490
00:40:07,907 --> 00:40:10,373
Did they all get drafted?
You don't think it's strange?

491
00:40:10,507 --> 00:40:11,540
No.

492
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,140
We only have two of them.

493
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:17,005
The public prosecutor is off sick,
and the detective is out on a case.

494
00:40:17,105 --> 00:40:19,671
You can mail it in. Or go to court.

495
00:40:19,805 --> 00:40:21,638
OK, I get it.
Give me a refusal note in writing.

496
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:26,203
I told you: I'm not authorised.

497
00:40:28,036 --> 00:40:29,869
Hello. I need to see the judge.

498
00:40:30,002 --> 00:40:31,536
No one's here.

499
00:40:31,668 --> 00:40:33,435
- No one at all?
- No one.

500
00:40:34,501 --> 00:40:36,501
No assistants or secretaries?

501
00:40:38,101 --> 00:40:41,000
- When will they be in?
- I've not been informed.

502
00:40:41,134 --> 00:40:43,166
- I see.
- Goodbye.

503
00:40:43,266 --> 00:40:44,433
Thanks.

504
00:40:58,962 --> 00:41:01,795
- Up the stairs, third floor.
- Thanks.

505
00:42:05,248 --> 00:42:08,847
Why aren't you answering your phone?
I called and called.

506
00:42:08,981 --> 00:42:11,380
Seriously?
That little devil Vitya

507
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,414
must have been playing with it.

508
00:42:13,846 --> 00:42:15,246
Surrender!

509
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,645
- Why try to kill me?
- 'Cause you're pretty!

510
00:42:17,745 --> 00:42:20,512
- Say hello to Lilya!
- Howdy!

511
00:42:20,645 --> 00:42:24,977
Men are all the same.
First, you're pretty. Next, they'll kill you.

512
00:42:25,111 --> 00:42:27,211
Angela, where's Pasha?

513
00:42:47,473 --> 00:42:48,939
I've already heard

514
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:51,705
of your crusades earlier today.

515
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:54,238
- Take a seat.
- Thank you.

516
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:57,437
- What's your name, I forget?
- Dmitry.

517
00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:03,303
Right. So, you're really trying
to stick it to me, aren't you?

518
00:43:03,436 --> 00:43:05,302
You asked for it.

519
00:43:05,769 --> 00:43:08,368
But that's nothing, Vadim,

520
00:43:08,468 --> 00:43:10,968
in comparison
to what's in this folder.

521
00:43:11,101 --> 00:43:13,133
Here, take a look.

522
00:43:15,033 --> 00:43:16,566
There's nothing
you don't already know,

523
00:43:16,666 --> 00:43:20,932
but it's good to refresh
your memory sometimes.

524
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,898
This conversation is off
to a strange start.

525
00:43:24,065 --> 00:43:25,331
How so?

526
00:43:25,464 --> 00:43:28,297
I thought we were going to talk
about your friend.

527
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:31,263
As in, about our litigation
or something else?

528
00:43:31,363 --> 00:43:32,496
Something else.

529
00:43:32,629 --> 00:43:34,762
You must mean his unlawful detention?

530
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:38,462
Article 301
of the Russian Criminal Code.

531
00:43:39,761 --> 00:43:41,595
It's good you've been notified.

532
00:43:42,194 --> 00:43:46,094
Vadim, it would be great
if you saw to it that justice is served

533
00:43:46,226 --> 00:43:48,393
and those responsible
for this outrage are punished.

534
00:43:48,493 --> 00:43:49,893
I would be glad to help, but...

535
00:43:50,025 --> 00:43:54,125
But you don't see what's in it for you?
Just look in the folder.

536
00:43:54,258 --> 00:43:55,558
Take a look.

537
00:43:56,058 --> 00:43:59,791
You'll see that Kolya's release
is only the first step.

538
00:43:59,923 --> 00:44:01,523
Here's what I think we'll do,

539
00:44:02,856 --> 00:44:05,589
young man.

540
00:44:08,322 --> 00:44:12,521
I'll let your Kolya out,
and you'll gather your stuff

541
00:44:13,788 --> 00:44:15,787
and quietly go back

542
00:44:15,887 --> 00:44:18,019
to where you came from.

543
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:20,819
- To Moscow?
- Yeah, back to Moscow.

544
00:44:20,952 --> 00:44:24,518
Vadim, I'm afraid
Ivan would not have that.

545
00:44:27,017 --> 00:44:29,317
He'd say,
"Dima, why didn't you do

546
00:44:29,451 --> 00:44:32,250
"everything in your power
to restore justice?"

547
00:44:35,816 --> 00:44:39,082
You know Ivan personally?

548
00:44:39,215 --> 00:44:40,215
Ivan Kostrov?

549
00:44:40,748 --> 00:44:42,614
We're talking about him, right?

550
00:44:42,748 --> 00:44:44,647
Of course I do. You bet.

551
00:44:45,347 --> 00:44:46,780
We're pals.

552
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,513
He's a lawyer, I'm a lawyer.

553
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:51,212
Moscow is a huge,
but close-knit city.

554
00:44:52,212 --> 00:44:55,079
No one is out of reach.

555
00:44:55,179 --> 00:44:58,178
And if I don't read this, then what?

556
00:44:58,311 --> 00:44:59,810
Doesn't matter.

557
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:02,443
Take my word for it:
the facts in there are damning.

558
00:45:02,543 --> 00:45:06,176
You know what I'm talking about.
They are, after all, your handiwork.

559
00:45:06,276 --> 00:45:07,809
Horrible stuff.

560
00:45:08,442 --> 00:45:11,208
How do you sleep at night?

561
00:45:12,441 --> 00:45:13,641
So,

562
00:45:14,941 --> 00:45:16,240
let's make a deal, or else...

563
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,740
Or else what?

564
00:45:19,106 --> 00:45:21,773
Oh, it's hard to even imagine
what would happen.

565
00:45:21,906 --> 00:45:25,105
All within the provisions of the law,
of course.

566
00:45:25,205 --> 00:45:28,771
Firstly, your name would be all over
the newspapers and the Internet

567
00:45:28,871 --> 00:45:31,937
and on TV, all over the news.

568
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:43,401
You youngsters
like playing with fire.

569
00:45:43,501 --> 00:45:46,867
Vadim,
you're not exactly an old man either.

570
00:45:47,034 --> 00:45:49,167
Or is it time to retire? No?

571
00:45:49,233 --> 00:45:50,599
Have you thought of that?

572
00:45:52,399 --> 00:45:56,198
Come back with the tea later, Yulia.

573
00:46:00,931 --> 00:46:04,030
Right. Let's see it.

574
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:09,029
Let's see what you're trying
to stick us with here.

575
00:46:09,129 --> 00:46:12,228
A horror movie with you in the lead.

576
00:46:12,328 --> 00:46:16,727
How did it go? They cuffed him
and threw him in the cage.

577
00:46:17,461 --> 00:46:19,160
What did he do? Nothing!

578
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:23,292
Last night, the mayor barreled in,
drunk, told 'em to pack their things.

579
00:46:23,426 --> 00:46:25,159
They had
another court hearing yesterday.

580
00:46:25,292 --> 00:46:26,825
Yes, they're getting demolished.

581
00:46:27,591 --> 00:46:28,925
That's all.

582
00:46:29,058 --> 00:46:33,024
This morning, they went to the police
to drop off a statement

583
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:34,857
and they took Kolya in.

584
00:46:37,423 --> 00:46:39,556
Lilya is sitting right here with me.

585
00:46:40,222 --> 00:46:43,588
Don't be dumb,
I'm not calling just for a chat.

586
00:46:43,688 --> 00:46:47,054
Tell Stepanych to get his arse
to the police department.

587
00:46:47,187 --> 00:46:49,154
We have to get Kolya out of there.

588
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:51,786
Good.

589
00:46:52,253 --> 00:46:53,953
Yeah, you'd better go yourself.

590
00:46:55,585 --> 00:46:58,518
And call us right away.
We're stressing out here.

591
00:46:58,618 --> 00:47:02,851
And pick up when I call,
or I'll worry. OK then.

592
00:47:02,951 --> 00:47:03,951
What?

593
00:47:04,617 --> 00:47:05,717
Me too.

594
00:47:06,983 --> 00:47:09,182
OK, Pasha, go already. Bye.

595
00:47:10,849 --> 00:47:12,849
- Something like that.
- Thanks.

596
00:47:12,949 --> 00:47:15,148
Don't worry, they'll get him out.

597
00:47:15,281 --> 00:47:18,948
They got Vova out 5 times.
He was in for real stuff - fighting,

598
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,814
theft...

599
00:47:20,947 --> 00:47:22,780
Mum, I'm hungry.

600
00:47:22,913 --> 00:47:24,513
Go play outside.
Dinner's not ready yet.

601
00:47:24,613 --> 00:47:26,712
- Can I?
- What?

602
00:47:26,812 --> 00:47:28,778
- Go outside?
- I just told you, go!

603
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:32,377
But not too far. If you go
to building 9 again, I'll kill you!

604
00:47:32,477 --> 00:47:34,077
- OK, Mum!
- And put your hat on!

605
00:47:42,309 --> 00:47:43,542
Come on in.

606
00:47:53,473 --> 00:47:55,706
It's OK, honey. We'll pull through.

607
00:47:56,306 --> 00:48:00,005
We'll get all hands on deck
and do a great job.

608
00:48:01,538 --> 00:48:05,338
Won't be fancy, but it'll be homely.

609
00:48:05,437 --> 00:48:06,470
Won't it?

610
00:48:11,569 --> 00:48:13,369
Let's go look at the kitchen.

611
00:48:18,201 --> 00:48:20,167
There's even a radiator in here.

612
00:48:21,067 --> 00:48:22,134
You hear me?

613
00:48:28,133 --> 00:48:30,065
Let's say you got me. Now what?

614
00:48:30,498 --> 00:48:31,732
That depends on you.

615
00:48:31,865 --> 00:48:34,331
I got that much. What do you want?

616
00:48:37,163 --> 00:48:41,363
You're the second public official today
to use that tone with me.

617
00:48:41,463 --> 00:48:44,595
Don't beat around the bush.
Get to the point.

618
00:48:46,062 --> 00:48:48,561
I want Kolya to keep what's his.

619
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:54,660
That's not possible.

620
00:48:57,659 --> 00:48:59,859
I thought there was
nothing impossible for you.

621
00:49:00,925 --> 00:49:03,325
Well, now you know better.

622
00:49:03,425 --> 00:49:06,091
You can't get 3.5 million?
I don't believe that.

623
00:49:06,224 --> 00:49:08,257
Oh, that's what you mean.

624
00:49:09,424 --> 00:49:10,890
That I can do.

625
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:13,089
And, of course, release Kolya.

626
00:49:13,223 --> 00:49:14,623
It's a deal.

627
00:49:15,955 --> 00:49:17,688
Leave me your phone number.

628
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:21,554
I'll call you in a couple of days.
We'll meet and discuss the details.

629
00:49:22,221 --> 00:49:23,253
You'll still be here?

630
00:49:23,353 --> 00:49:24,587
Yes, I'll be in town.

631
00:49:25,053 --> 00:49:26,820
Except what's there to discuss?

632
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:31,285
We'll only need to meet
so you can hand me the money.

633
00:49:34,485 --> 00:49:37,984
Hey, are you baptised?

634
00:49:38,117 --> 00:49:39,117
What?

635
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:41,917
Why da you ask?

636
00:49:42,417 --> 00:49:44,049
I'm just curious.

637
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,915
I'm a lawyer, Vadim.
I believe in facts.

638
00:49:54,447 --> 00:49:54,747
OK. You got it.

639
00:49:54,747 --> 00:49:55,914
Goodbye.

640
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:01,279
Bye.

641
00:50:34,138 --> 00:50:37,005
Is everything OK, Vadim?

642
00:50:38,371 --> 00:50:38,604
Yes.

643
00:50:39,071 --> 00:50:41,237
You never brought me that aspirin.

644
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:45,969
Get me those three right away.

645
00:50:47,235 --> 00:50:48,302
Who?

646
00:50:48,435 --> 00:50:51,034
Tarasov, Goryunov and Tkachuk.

647
00:50:51,734 --> 00:50:54,001
Find them, I don't care how.

648
00:50:57,633 --> 00:50:59,133
And close the door.

649
00:50:59,266 --> 00:51:01,232
You think
he'll give us the 3 million?

650
00:51:01,366 --> 00:51:03,432
Not 3, but 3.5.

651
00:51:03,565 --> 00:51:04,865
We'll see.

652
00:51:05,399 --> 00:51:08,331
But he shit himself big time.
And that's a good sign.

653
00:51:09,898 --> 00:51:11,230
Right...

654
00:51:12,197 --> 00:51:15,529
What did I have here last time?

655
00:51:15,663 --> 00:51:17,596
Borscht, dumplings, beer.

656
00:51:17,729 --> 00:51:19,128
That's it.

657
00:51:19,262 --> 00:51:20,428
Have you decided?

658
00:51:20,495 --> 00:51:23,595
Yes, Tatyana.
Bring us two borschts, please,

659
00:51:24,061 --> 00:51:27,427
two servings of dumplings,
beer and fruit juice.

660
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,126
Or are you having beer too?

661
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:30,760
Fruit juice is fine.

662
00:51:30,893 --> 00:51:32,093
- Fruit juice then.
- Is that it?

663
00:51:32,226 --> 00:51:33,293
Yes, that's all.

664
00:51:33,393 --> 00:51:36,025
I have to go up to my room.

665
00:51:36,125 --> 00:51:38,591
Please wait 10 minutes
so the food doesn't get cold.

666
00:51:39,524 --> 00:51:41,391
- All right.
- Thanks.

667
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:46,023
Can you wait a bit?
I'll be right back.

668
00:52:58,674 --> 00:52:59,740
Kolya?

669
00:52:59,874 --> 00:53:01,206
<i>Hello, where are you?</i>

670
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:04,373
We're in the restaurant at the hotel.

671
00:53:04,473 --> 00:53:05,539
Well, of course.

672
00:53:05,673 --> 00:53:09,872
I'm behind bars - you're at a restaurant.
I should have known.

673
00:53:11,204 --> 00:53:12,904
Yes, they released me.

674
00:53:15,503 --> 00:53:20,136
Not on the phone.
Let's meet, and you'll tell me everything.

675
00:53:20,236 --> 00:53:21,935
Finish up.

676
00:53:22,069 --> 00:53:25,068
I'm headed there. See you.

677
00:53:58,361 --> 00:54:00,361
They've been keeping dirt on me!

678
00:54:00,494 --> 00:54:02,693
I've known it a long time.

679
00:54:02,827 --> 00:54:06,492
All I ever hear from you is
the same thing right, left and centre:

680
00:54:06,592 --> 00:54:10,359
"Everything's fine, Vadim".

681
00:54:11,158 --> 00:54:13,391
"Everything's fine, perfect weather -

682
00:54:13,891 --> 00:54:15,790
"nothing to worry about!"

683
00:54:15,924 --> 00:54:18,490
But I'm fucking worried!

684
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:23,756
Because I smell a rat.
Something bad is brewing!

685
00:54:23,922 --> 00:54:27,088
When did anything like this
ever happen? I crush some louse

686
00:54:27,221 --> 00:54:32,087
and he turns the tables on me!
Brings in a lawyer from Moscow!

687
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:34,853
And that bastard starts
blackmailing me.

688
00:54:34,986 --> 00:54:36,986
And drops big names!

689
00:54:37,086 --> 00:54:38,852
What if he's bluffing?

690
00:54:38,952 --> 00:54:40,119
Bluffing?

691
00:54:40,219 --> 00:54:44,218
How about you stop doodling
and figure out who's paying him?

692
00:54:44,351 --> 00:54:45,951
You think it's that loser Kolya?

693
00:54:46,051 --> 00:54:48,283
You should know better, woman.

694
00:54:48,383 --> 00:54:53,282
Or do you think
that Moscow lawyer came here

695
00:54:53,416 --> 00:54:55,115
to bust his arse for free?

696
00:54:55,215 --> 00:54:56,515
More importantly,

697
00:54:56,649 --> 00:54:59,881
where did he get that information?

698
00:55:01,348 --> 00:55:04,680
I almost fucking lost it
when I opened that folder.

699
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:07,313
So what was in that folder?

700
00:55:07,413 --> 00:55:10,346
You don't need to know that.

701
00:55:13,411 --> 00:55:17,744
So they have something on you
that we don't know about?

702
00:55:17,844 --> 00:55:20,176
We have an election in a year.

703
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:21,510
Did you forget?

704
00:55:22,876 --> 00:55:24,909
If I don't get elected...

705
00:55:25,942 --> 00:55:27,375
Need I say more?

706
00:55:30,241 --> 00:55:32,474
You'll all go down.

707
00:55:33,107 --> 00:55:35,407
No holidays abroad, no mansions,

708
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:37,173
no cash.

709
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:40,506
We'll all be marching

710
00:55:40,606 --> 00:55:42,671
off to the monastery

711
00:55:42,771 --> 00:55:44,771
to a jolly tune.

712
00:55:44,871 --> 00:55:46,738
You're paranoid.

713
00:55:46,871 --> 00:55:49,804
You see enemies everywhere.
Ease up on the booze.

714
00:55:50,637 --> 00:55:54,036
Your head will roll first!

715
00:55:54,169 --> 00:55:57,668
Cut the drama.
And don't yell at me!

716
00:55:57,768 --> 00:55:59,801
Save that for your wife.

717
00:56:00,368 --> 00:56:02,434
Let's be constructive.

718
00:56:02,534 --> 00:56:03,800
Let's.

719
00:56:05,334 --> 00:56:07,833
Maybe I could lean on him a bit?

720
00:56:08,466 --> 00:56:11,165
Within lawful limits, of course.

721
00:56:11,299 --> 00:56:12,865
Absolutely not.

722
00:56:15,332 --> 00:56:19,663
First off, get me the story
on this Moscow lawyer.

723
00:56:20,997 --> 00:56:26,596
Use your own channels or work together,
but find out who he is

724
00:56:27,295 --> 00:56:29,795
and who he's working for.

725
00:56:30,561 --> 00:56:33,660
He was rubbing it in
about Kostrov,

726
00:56:33,794 --> 00:56:35,527
and you say "lean on him"?

727
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:37,327
The Committee Chairman?

728
00:56:37,993 --> 00:56:42,726
That's right, sweetheart. Why do you
think I've been going on about it?

729
00:56:46,225 --> 00:56:47,657
So get to it.

730
00:56:48,657 --> 00:56:50,357
Tomorrow, I'll consult the bosses.

731
00:56:50,424 --> 00:56:55,156
They're going
to run their checks on him.

732
00:56:56,189 --> 00:56:59,388
Get to it, my good people,
and get cracking.

733
00:57:21,284 --> 00:57:22,284
Hello, Dad...

734
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:24,250
But it's still early.

735
00:57:25,083 --> 00:57:28,816
Oh, I forgot...
Yeah, I'll be right there... Sure, OK.

736
00:57:29,482 --> 00:57:31,182
Yeah, I'm not far.

737
00:57:32,181 --> 00:57:34,081
OK, guys, I'm off.

738
00:57:35,181 --> 00:57:38,746
- Mummy calling you?
- We're going out shooting tomorrow.

739
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,480
You're lucky!

740
00:57:41,346 --> 00:57:44,379
That's right,
go and watch your bedtime cartoons.

741
00:58:14,206 --> 00:58:15,738
Where is everyone?

742
00:58:16,272 --> 00:58:18,071
Mum is asleep.

743
00:58:18,171 --> 00:58:21,471
Dima's in the outhouse
with a magazine.

744
00:58:27,103 --> 00:58:28,369
So, mate,

745
00:58:30,335 --> 00:58:32,135
you like Dima?

746
00:58:32,568 --> 00:58:34,701
Sure. Seems like an all right guy.

747
00:58:37,501 --> 00:58:40,600
That "all right guy"
did a major deed today.

748
00:58:41,366 --> 00:58:42,500
What deed?

749
00:58:43,132 --> 00:58:44,566
He squeezed the mayor.

750
00:58:46,099 --> 00:58:47,165
What?

751
00:58:47,831 --> 00:58:49,698
Just like that, son.

752
00:58:49,798 --> 00:58:51,531
Took him by the balls

753
00:58:52,264 --> 00:58:54,864
and pulled ever so gently.

754
00:58:57,896 --> 00:58:59,263
I don't get it.

755
00:59:00,329 --> 00:59:02,362
You'll get it when you're older.

756
00:59:02,462 --> 00:59:03,628
Listen,

757
00:59:04,095 --> 00:59:06,028
you stink of fire.

758
00:59:06,161 --> 00:59:08,294
Hanging out
in the old church again?

759
00:59:08,427 --> 00:59:09,427
Well, yeah.

760
00:59:10,027 --> 00:59:11,693
Always looking for trouble.

761
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:16,225
- What kind of trouble?
- Some kind or other.

762
00:59:17,459 --> 00:59:20,192
Stuffing your face right before bed?

763
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:22,624
Well, yeah.

764
00:59:28,923 --> 00:59:30,289
Come over here.

765
00:59:31,022 --> 00:59:32,055
Sit down.

766
00:59:33,821 --> 00:59:35,121
What is it?

767
00:59:38,054 --> 00:59:39,454
Were you drinking beer?

768
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,553
No. The other guys had some.

769
00:59:43,653 --> 00:59:45,419
I can smell it on you.

770
00:59:45,519 --> 00:59:46,619
Hey, Roma.

771
00:59:50,018 --> 00:59:51,318
What took you so long?

772
00:59:51,451 --> 00:59:53,251
Lay a cable out there?

773
00:59:53,917 --> 00:59:56,317
Interesting book
you've got out there.

774
00:59:57,816 --> 00:59:59,749
Couldn't put it down?

775
01:00:01,749 --> 01:00:02,815
Yeah...

776
01:00:06,314 --> 01:00:07,914
A couple of comedians, eh?

777
01:00:09,014 --> 01:00:13,580
Yeah, that's our shitty
northern sense of humour.

778
01:00:19,545 --> 01:00:21,178
What's so funny?

779
01:00:21,311 --> 01:00:24,544
It's all good, bro.

780
01:00:25,877 --> 01:00:27,610
It's all good.

781
01:00:28,143 --> 01:00:29,909
No, seriously, what am I missing?

782
01:00:31,943 --> 01:00:33,576
Whatever, you idiots...

783
01:03:02,376 --> 01:03:04,643
Can you do this?

784
01:03:04,743 --> 01:03:07,009
I'll show you. Watch.

785
01:03:09,942 --> 01:03:12,008
Pasha, turn off that crap.

786
01:03:14,407 --> 01:03:15,774
Dima!

787
01:03:16,273 --> 01:03:17,807
Come here for a moment.

788
01:03:21,539 --> 01:03:23,139
Pasha, what the hell?

789
01:03:23,239 --> 01:03:26,005
Angela, let's enjoy the silence.

790
01:03:26,105 --> 01:03:28,238
Not enough silence at your place?

791
01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:31,037
Dima,

792
01:03:31,637 --> 01:03:34,337
- I'm trusting you with my rifle.
- Thanks.

793
01:03:34,503 --> 01:03:37,003
Every guy should have his own gun,

794
01:03:37,103 --> 01:03:39,036
so you don't have to share Kolya's.

795
01:03:39,168 --> 01:03:40,402
Agreed.

796
01:03:41,268 --> 01:03:42,935
What will you use then?

797
01:03:43,068 --> 01:03:44,601
I'll show you.

798
01:03:44,734 --> 01:03:45,901
You need help, Kolya?

799
01:03:46,034 --> 01:03:49,100
No, Dima, I've got this.
Relax, kick back.

800
01:03:49,233 --> 01:03:50,400
You're the guest.

801
01:03:52,666 --> 01:03:54,265
Wow, Stepanych!

802
01:03:54,399 --> 01:03:55,832
Someone's armed for war.

803
01:03:55,965 --> 01:03:58,964
Why not? I like shooting in style.
It's my birthday.

804
01:03:59,098 --> 01:04:03,097
- What, no grenade launcher?
- Show me the target, I'll get one.

805
01:04:05,896 --> 01:04:08,896
- Mum, I'm thirsty.
- It's in the car.

806
01:04:12,195 --> 01:04:14,961
Where are you going?
Out of the water, now!

807
01:04:15,028 --> 01:04:18,127
Vitya, are you deaf?
I said, get out of the water!

808
01:04:21,527 --> 01:04:22,759
So, Kolya,

809
01:04:23,959 --> 01:04:25,226
shall we?

810
01:04:29,258 --> 01:04:30,525
Sure.

811
01:04:31,257 --> 01:04:32,257
Dima,

812
01:04:32,857 --> 01:04:34,124
Pasha, come on!

813
01:05:15,915 --> 01:05:17,147
Dima,

814
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:21,280
one drink if you hit it,
three if you miss.

815
01:05:21,414 --> 01:05:22,880
Got it.

816
01:05:28,278 --> 01:05:29,645
One drink!

817
01:05:33,044 --> 01:05:34,311
Just one!

818
01:05:34,411 --> 01:05:36,810
To your health, Stepanych!
Cheers!

819
01:05:36,910 --> 01:05:38,243
Same to you.

820
01:05:39,610 --> 01:05:41,976
Go, Pasha. Nail it.

821
01:05:42,076 --> 01:05:43,709
Don't jinx me.

822
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,273
Three drinks for him.

823
01:05:53,373 --> 01:05:56,072
He missed on purpose,
to get shitfaced.

824
01:05:56,772 --> 01:05:58,606
- Just pour it.
- Have a pickle.

825
01:05:58,738 --> 01:06:00,238
To you, Comrade Colonel.

826
01:06:01,538 --> 01:06:03,537
Dima, you show them.

827
01:06:08,736 --> 01:06:10,869
Anyone can hit it with a sight.

828
01:06:11,969 --> 01:06:13,369
The sight was closed.

829
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:15,268
Are you for me or against me?

830
01:06:16,768 --> 01:06:18,068
Stepanych.

831
01:06:18,134 --> 01:06:20,867
Pleasure to meet you,
happy birthday!

832
01:06:20,967 --> 01:06:22,233
Pleasure's all mine.

833
01:06:27,699 --> 01:06:28,832
Stepanych, just don't...

834
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:34,231
Enjoying the silence?

835
01:06:34,364 --> 01:06:35,997
What did you do that for?

836
01:06:36,097 --> 01:06:38,330
What do we use for a target now?

837
01:06:38,430 --> 01:06:41,263
Your hat? Are you fucking crazy?

838
01:06:41,363 --> 01:06:42,662
Kolya,	 the kids...

839
01:06:42,762 --> 01:06:45,728
What about the kids?
They just went deaf.

840
01:06:45,862 --> 01:06:47,061
No, I heard everything.

841
01:06:47,195 --> 01:06:50,661
Can't I shoot to my heart's content
on my birthday?

842
01:06:50,761 --> 01:06:51,794
Well, now you have.

843
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:54,960
I've got better targets still.

844
01:06:56,693 --> 01:06:57,959
Pasha!

845
01:06:58,093 --> 01:06:59,225
Go get them.

846
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:01,858
Angela, shall we get started
on the kebabs?

847
01:07:04,024 --> 01:07:06,957
- Can I shoot the AK, please?
- Ask Stepanych.

848
01:07:07,057 --> 01:07:09,657
Stepanych, can I fire your AK?

849
01:07:09,757 --> 01:07:11,023
Sure.

850
01:07:11,490 --> 01:07:14,089
He's a grown boy. Let him.

851
01:07:14,222 --> 01:07:16,521
Stay with us, gals.
It's about to get interesting.

852
01:07:16,621 --> 01:07:18,755
Call us when it does.

853
01:07:20,354 --> 01:07:23,187
- I'll go and light the grill.
- Can you manage?

854
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:25,053
I think so...

855
01:07:33,418 --> 01:07:35,685
Nice one, Stepanych!

856
01:07:38,050 --> 01:07:40,150
Got anyone more current?

857
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:42,916
I've got all kinds of stuff.

858
01:07:43,049 --> 01:07:45,715
But it's too early
for the current ones.

859
01:07:45,782 --> 01:07:48,148
Not enough
of a historical perspective.

860
01:07:48,282 --> 01:07:50,648
Let them ripen up on the wall a bit.

861
01:07:51,847 --> 01:07:52,881
How do we stand them up?

862
01:07:53,014 --> 01:07:55,313
Nail them to the log.

863
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:57,246
Do we have nails?

864
01:07:57,780 --> 01:07:58,846
No.

865
01:07:59,412 --> 01:08:01,212
I've got some screws in the car.

866
01:08:08,144 --> 01:08:09,677
Let's go have a drink.

867
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:11,043
Let's.

868
01:08:16,876 --> 01:08:18,842
I've got Yeltsin, too.

869
01:08:20,641 --> 01:08:23,307
But he's more small-time.

870
01:08:24,407 --> 01:08:25,874
The drunken conductor...

871
01:08:27,206 --> 01:08:29,539
We forgot the nails...
Your fault.

872
01:08:29,673 --> 01:08:32,472
Look at you, girls!
There's a sight for sore eyes!

873
01:08:32,605 --> 01:08:35,005
Look at those honed,
precise movements!

874
01:08:35,138 --> 01:08:36,504
Yeah.

875
01:08:36,638 --> 01:08:38,404
We're quite the roadside attraction!

876
01:08:47,202 --> 01:08:49,669
- Any bread?
- In the bag.

877
01:08:49,769 --> 01:08:53,268
- What else is there?
- Pickles.

878
01:08:53,368 --> 01:08:55,134
- Help me.
- I'm busy.

879
01:08:55,234 --> 01:08:58,033
- I'm busy too.
- What are you busy with?

880
01:08:58,167 --> 01:08:59,366
With stuff...

881
01:09:01,932 --> 01:09:05,498
Kolya, come here! Let's drink.

882
01:09:14,996 --> 01:09:16,296
That's enough.

883
01:09:16,729 --> 01:09:20,095
My oh my, what a guy...

884
01:09:22,861 --> 01:09:24,427
Where are you off to, Lilya?

885
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:26,993
Wouldn't you like to know?

886
01:09:27,127 --> 01:09:29,193
Did we bring the charcoal?

887
01:09:29,326 --> 01:09:31,626
- What for?
- We'll run out of wood.

888
01:09:31,726 --> 01:09:35,325
Plenty of driftwood.
Go get some, but have a drink first.

889
01:09:35,459 --> 01:09:36,958
Chase it down.

890
01:09:38,458 --> 01:09:40,957
Where's my drink?

891
01:09:41,057 --> 01:09:42,224
Here you are.

892
01:09:43,623 --> 01:09:44,989
Thank you.

893
01:09:48,289 --> 01:09:50,388
Oh, this is nice!

894
01:09:52,121 --> 01:09:55,521
- Where is that wood, you say?
- Past the waterfall. You'll see it.

895
01:09:55,654 --> 01:09:56,820
Got it.

896
01:10:09,184 --> 01:10:11,551
Vitya, come down here.

897
01:10:11,651 --> 01:10:12,717
I'm scared.

898
01:10:12,851 --> 01:10:14,450
- Give me your hand.
- No, I'm scared.

899
01:10:16,183 --> 01:10:18,016
Suit yourself.

900
01:10:27,547 --> 01:10:29,047
Where's your kid?

901
01:10:29,147 --> 01:10:30,680
And where's yours?

902
01:10:35,412 --> 01:10:37,078
He'll break his neck.

903
01:10:37,178 --> 01:10:39,045
He'll be fine.

904
01:10:39,178 --> 01:10:43,044
Let him run around and enjoy nature.
There are no animals here.

905
01:10:43,210 --> 01:10:45,776
Man is the most dangerous animal.

906
01:10:45,876 --> 01:10:48,509
- None of those here either.
- Well, we're here.

907
01:10:48,643 --> 01:10:52,108
- You calling yourself a man?
- Get a handle on your woman, Pasha.

908
01:10:52,208 --> 01:10:53,942
Too late now.

909
01:10:56,374 --> 01:10:57,707
Mummy!

910
01:10:59,740 --> 01:11:01,273
What happened, Vitya?

911
01:11:01,373 --> 01:11:04,106
That man is choking Lilya.

912
01:11:04,206 --> 01:11:05,839
Roma saw it and started crying.

913
01:11:05,972 --> 01:11:08,071
What are you talking about? What man?

914
01:11:08,171 --> 01:11:10,071
The handsome one from Moscow.

915
01:11:17,003 --> 01:11:18,236
You coppers

916
01:11:18,336 --> 01:11:20,702
just gonna wait
for the mayhem to start?

917
01:11:21,269 --> 01:11:23,435
Mum, what's "mayhem"?

918
01:11:25,368 --> 01:11:27,967
- You'll know when you're older.
- I want to know now.

919
01:11:28,101 --> 01:11:30,600
Let's put that gun away

920
01:11:31,334 --> 01:11:32,700
from harm.

921
01:11:37,932 --> 01:11:39,565
Mum, what's "harm"?

922
01:11:39,665 --> 01:11:43,231
Stop annoying me.
Remember when you set the cat on fire?

923
01:11:43,831 --> 01:11:47,330
- Yeah. Who did it this time?
- Nobody.

924
01:11:47,463 --> 01:11:50,462
- Then where's the harm?
- Knock it off.

925
01:11:52,129 --> 01:11:53,495
Oh, God...

926
01:11:54,229 --> 01:11:56,495
You've got too anxious, Vadim.

927
01:11:56,628 --> 01:12:00,894
Worrying yourself and others
over nothing.

928
01:12:00,994 --> 01:12:03,060
As if you don't know

929
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:06,492
we're all in God's hands.
It's His will.

930
01:12:06,626 --> 01:12:09,592
Of course I know, Father.

931
01:12:09,725 --> 01:12:11,358
So what troubles you?

932
01:12:11,858 --> 01:12:14,091
Is your faith wavering?

933
01:12:14,957 --> 01:12:17,456
Do you take communion?
Go to confession?

934
01:12:19,056 --> 01:12:21,089
Every Sunday, without fail.

935
01:12:22,055 --> 01:12:23,322
I try to.

936
01:12:24,022 --> 01:12:27,354
Of course I can't always make it.
I get so busy...

937
01:12:27,454 --> 01:12:28,988
But I try.

938
01:12:30,121 --> 01:12:32,220
Who's your confessor?

939
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:39,919
Our local priest,
the one you referred me to.

940
01:12:40,019 --> 01:12:41,485
Father Alexei?

941
01:12:41,618 --> 01:12:42,985
That's the one.

942
01:12:44,118 --> 01:12:46,084
He's a good priest.

943
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:48,350
Seems OK.

944
01:12:49,817 --> 01:12:51,883
Get a hold of yourself, Vadim.

945
01:12:51,983 --> 01:12:55,116
And don't worry,
you are doing God's work.

946
01:12:55,782 --> 01:12:58,415
It is said
that good deeds are done

947
01:12:58,515 --> 01:13:00,747
happily and with ease,

948
01:13:01,714 --> 01:13:03,447
but don't forget

949
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:06,679
the enemy is ever ready
and does not sleep.

950
01:13:06,779 --> 01:13:08,545
That's the thing.

951
01:13:08,645 --> 01:13:10,712
You know...

952
01:13:11,245 --> 01:13:13,612
It's like everything is going wrong.

953
01:13:14,844 --> 01:13:15,577
I'm uneasy.

954
01:13:16,111 --> 01:13:17,077
I'm uneasy.

955
01:13:17,811 --> 01:13:18,910
What's happened is...

956
01:13:19,010 --> 01:13:22,410
Don't reveal anything to me.
You're not at confession.

957
01:13:24,242 --> 01:13:26,409
You and I may be working

958
01:13:26,941 --> 01:13:28,575
for the same cause.

959
01:13:29,141 --> 01:13:33,140
But you've got your territory,
and I've got mine.

960
01:13:33,274 --> 01:13:35,240
I understand that.

961
01:13:38,006 --> 01:13:40,072
I just feel ill at ease...

962
01:13:41,072 --> 01:13:44,938
I told you a couple of days ago,
and I'll tell you again:

963
01:13:45,071 --> 01:13:47,237
all power is from God.

964
01:13:47,804 --> 01:13:50,170
Where there's power, there's might.

965
01:13:50,304 --> 01:13:54,269
If you hold power in your territory,

966
01:13:54,935 --> 01:13:59,102
solve your issues yourself,
with your might.

967
01:13:59,234 --> 01:14:02,034
Don't go looking for help,

968
01:14:02,134 --> 01:14:04,733
or the enemy will think
you are weak.

969
01:14:07,633 --> 01:14:10,666
Honestly, I have to lecture you
like a child.

970
01:14:10,799 --> 01:14:11,799
Vadim...

971
01:14:13,231 --> 01:14:15,098
I don't recognise you like this.

972
01:14:17,598 --> 01:14:19,397
Everything OK with the wife?

973
01:14:20,264 --> 01:14:21,830
I think so.

974
01:14:21,963 --> 01:14:23,363
How are the kids?

975
01:14:24,096 --> 01:14:25,662
They're fine.

976
01:14:26,928 --> 01:14:28,395
You're not sick?

977
01:14:31,095 --> 01:14:32,527
No.

978
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,526
That's a blessing.

979
01:14:49,524 --> 01:14:51,290
God bless you.

980
01:15:50,011 --> 01:15:52,244
It's all my fault.

981
01:15:52,377 --> 01:15:54,277
No such thing.

982
01:15:55,277 --> 01:15:57,776
Each of us is guilty
of our own faults.

983
01:15:59,042 --> 01:16:01,242
Everything is everyone's fault.

984
01:16:03,075 --> 01:16:05,574
Even if we confess,

985
01:16:06,007 --> 01:16:08,974
the law doesn't hold it
to be a proof of guilt.

986
01:16:10,940 --> 01:16:13,939
We're innocent until proven guilty.

987
01:16:18,104 --> 01:16:21,271
But who's going to prove anything?
And to whom?

988
01:16:25,270 --> 01:16:27,036
Do you believe in God?

989
01:16:28,702 --> 01:16:31,169
Why do you all keep
asking me about God?

990
01:16:31,269 --> 01:16:32,801
I believe in facts.

991
01:16:32,935 --> 01:16:34,768
I'm a lawyer, Lilya.

992
01:16:43,866 --> 01:16:46,865
Don't. Please.

993
01:16:47,798 --> 01:16:49,565
No confessions.

994
01:16:55,396 --> 01:16:57,929
Because there's no proof?

995
01:17:00,362 --> 01:17:01,995
And there won't be any.

996
01:17:09,561 --> 01:17:11,693
Will you come with me?

997
01:17:19,625 --> 01:17:22,024
I don't understand you.

998
01:17:23,757 --> 01:17:25,923
I don't understand myself.

999
01:18:07,948 --> 01:18:11,180
I'd love to run away
with someone too.

1000
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:13,979
Women are dumb.

1001
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:17,079
Why?

1002
01:18:19,045 --> 01:18:21,345
Because you can't run away
from yourself.

1003
01:18:22,578 --> 01:18:23,844
Maybe not,

1004
01:18:23,977 --> 01:18:26,744
but I sure can run away from you.

1005
01:18:29,710 --> 01:18:31,276
Where to?

1006
01:18:32,643 --> 01:18:34,375
To whore around in Moscow?

1007
01:18:34,475 --> 01:18:36,508
- Why "whore around"?
- Because you're a whore.

1008
01:18:40,541 --> 01:18:41,873
See that?

1009
01:18:41,973 --> 01:18:43,173
Want me to smack you too?

1010
01:18:43,307 --> 01:18:44,373
What?

1011
01:18:45,140 --> 01:18:48,039
You guys can't take a joke?

1012
01:18:49,905 --> 01:18:54,071
I think I'd run
all the way to America.

1013
01:18:55,004 --> 01:18:57,737
Great. Why not the moon?

1014
01:18:57,870 --> 01:19:00,469
Are you asking for another slap?

1015
01:19:02,569 --> 01:19:04,336
Are the boys asleep?

1016
01:19:04,936 --> 01:19:06,335
Yeah.

1017
01:19:08,135 --> 01:19:09,867
Roma...

1018
01:19:11,301 --> 01:19:12,467
he's...

1019
01:19:13,634 --> 01:19:14,900
depressed.

1020
01:19:15,433 --> 01:19:17,133
That's understandable.

1021
01:19:18,565 --> 01:19:20,532
I'll talk to him tomorrow.

1022
01:19:21,598 --> 01:19:22,798
Kolya,

1023
01:19:23,998 --> 01:19:25,298
don't drink so much again.

1024
01:19:27,197 --> 01:19:30,496
Roma's traumatised enough as it is.

1025
01:19:30,996 --> 01:19:32,462
I won't.

1026
01:19:34,829 --> 01:19:35,862
Good.

1027
01:19:56,591 --> 01:19:58,224
She's back.

1028
01:19:59,890 --> 01:20:02,756
- Thank God.
- Maybe she's getting her things.

1029
01:20:03,523 --> 01:20:07,655
Shut up, Pasha. Go get Vitya.

1030
01:20:09,822 --> 01:20:11,588
Are you OK to drive?

1031
01:20:13,087 --> 01:20:14,820
I'm a traffic cop, aren't I?

1032
01:20:35,349 --> 01:20:36,682
Vitya...

1033
01:20:45,547 --> 01:20:48,413
Well, we'll be off.

1034
01:20:49,546 --> 01:20:51,379
So just, you know...

1035
01:21:23,272 --> 01:21:24,472
Kolya...

1036
01:21:36,869 --> 01:21:38,869
Do you want a child?

1037
01:22:11,795 --> 01:22:13,961
Hello? Yes, Vadim.

1038
01:22:15,094 --> 01:22:16,761
Yes, I recognised you.

1039
01:22:20,826 --> 01:22:22,759
Sure, let's meet.

1040
01:22:24,759 --> 01:22:26,258
I'm at the hotel.

1041
01:22:29,791 --> 01:22:31,557
Half an hour is good.

1042
01:22:45,288 --> 01:22:46,988
Can I see those?

1043
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:48,320
These?

1044
01:22:53,253 --> 01:22:54,752
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

1045
01:23:21,180 --> 01:23:23,080
Well, get in.

1046
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:26,312
I won't bite. Come on!

1047
01:23:27,112 --> 01:23:28,211
You're a tough guy.

1048
01:23:28,311 --> 01:23:29,778
If I'm not back here in two hours...

1049
01:23:29,878 --> 01:23:32,011
You will be, don't worry.

1050
01:23:43,342 --> 01:23:45,141
Rough night?

1051
01:23:45,275 --> 01:23:46,941
You're all puffy.

1052
01:23:47,041 --> 01:23:48,741
Where are we going?

1053
01:23:48,841 --> 01:23:50,774
You'll see.

1054
01:23:50,874 --> 01:23:52,640
You'll like it.

1055
01:23:52,740 --> 01:23:54,506
We'll sit and talk things over.

1056
01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:55,673
What things?

1057
01:23:55,806 --> 01:23:59,272
What do you mean?
You want money, right?

1058
01:24:00,305 --> 01:24:01,938
And I want guarantees.

1059
01:24:02,038 --> 01:24:03,537
Guarantees of what?

1060
01:24:03,671 --> 01:24:06,137
See, we're already talking.

1061
01:24:09,203 --> 01:24:12,302
Just a quick tete-a-tete, you know.

1062
01:25:34,984 --> 01:25:36,017
So,

1063
01:25:36,717 --> 01:25:38,317
how does it feel?

1064
01:25:40,416 --> 01:25:42,250
Why did you hit him in the face?

1065
01:25:42,816 --> 01:25:43,816
Although...

1066
01:25:43,949 --> 01:25:44,949
Ruslan!

1067
01:25:46,815 --> 01:25:48,081
Nothing to say?

1068
01:25:50,681 --> 01:25:53,647
No last words? No?

1069
01:25:55,913 --> 01:25:59,446
Not even a few
for your daughter maybe?

1070
01:26:00,546 --> 01:26:02,512
- What?
- That's enough.

1071
01:26:02,612 --> 01:26:05,745
Fine. We'll honour your last wish.

1072
01:26:45,236 --> 01:26:48,135
A public-private partnership.

1073
01:26:48,202 --> 01:26:50,068
A spot with great potential.

1074
01:26:50,168 --> 01:26:53,101
Close to the centre, by the sea.

1075
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:56,566
I'm very happy,

1076
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,733
because this is a brand of sorts.

1077
01:26:59,866 --> 01:27:01,765
I mean, your brand.

1078
01:27:01,865 --> 01:27:06,564
And people trust brands these days.
Officials hold high hopes for them.

1079
01:27:10,663 --> 01:27:14,363
The main thing now is
to keep the momentum.

1080
01:27:15,262 --> 01:27:19,395
The desire to make headway,
to work and move things forward.

1081
01:27:22,928 --> 01:27:25,360
I'll send my guy over today.

1082
01:27:25,460 --> 01:27:26,827
No, no, today.

1083
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:28,659
It's a deal then.

1084
01:27:37,158 --> 01:27:39,391
What do you mean, "crystal"?

1085
01:27:40,157 --> 01:27:42,257
That's your problem.

1086
01:27:42,357 --> 01:27:45,723
I told you loud and clear:
you get going, whatever it takes.

1087
01:27:45,823 --> 01:27:49,855
If you can't get going,
we'll find someone who can.

1088
01:27:51,022 --> 01:27:52,254
All right, back to work.

1089
01:32:25,962 --> 01:32:27,595
So, how’s Kolya?

1090
01:32:27,728 --> 01:32:29,962
He threatened to kill you both.

1091
01:32:30,062 --> 01:32:32,794
Then had a few drinks
and calmed down.

1092
01:32:34,927 --> 01:32:36,593
He loves you.

1093
01:32:40,859 --> 01:32:42,359
What about the other one?

1094
01:32:44,025 --> 01:32:45,925
Did he ask you to go to Moscow?

1095
01:35:55,650 --> 01:35:57,450
OK, fine.

1096
01:35:57,983 --> 01:36:00,882
Come pick it up.
But make it quick, OK?

1097
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:13,380
He's taking the boat tomorrow.

1098
01:36:19,145 --> 01:36:21,412
I'm selling it all off for nothing.

1099
01:36:27,343 --> 01:36:31,342
If that bastard builds himself
a palace here, I'll burn it down.

1100
01:36:33,342 --> 01:36:35,141
Hey, wandering spirit!

1101
01:36:36,741 --> 01:36:38,774
Why did you leave your phone?

1102
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:43,340
Roma!

1103
01:37:06,302 --> 01:37:07,302
Listen...

1104
01:37:07,468 --> 01:37:08,768
What do you want?

1105
01:37:09,468 --> 01:37:12,567
You ruined everything!
It's all because of you!

1106
01:37:12,633 --> 01:37:13,933
I hate you!

1107
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:15,600
What is it, Roma?

1108
01:37:16,133 --> 01:37:19,232
I don't want to live with you
anymore! I'm sick of you!

1109
01:37:19,299 --> 01:37:20,599
Son, calm down.

1110
01:37:20,765 --> 01:37:23,531
- Stay away from me!
- Stop it...

1111
01:37:24,231 --> 01:37:25,664
What's with you?

1112
01:37:28,430 --> 01:37:29,897
Get her out of here, Dad!

1113
01:37:29,997 --> 01:37:31,463
Get out!

1114
01:37:32,663 --> 01:37:33,929
Dad...

1115
01:37:35,562 --> 01:37:37,995
It's going to be OK.

1116
01:40:53,086 --> 01:40:54,585
What?

1117
01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:56,818
Forgive her. She's...

1118
01:40:59,751 --> 01:41:01,284
She's a good person.

1119
01:41:01,417 --> 01:41:03,583
Have you forgiven her?

1120
01:41:03,683 --> 01:41:05,083
I'm trying.

1121
01:41:08,282 --> 01:41:10,049
OK, better get going.

1122
01:41:36,410 --> 01:41:38,343
Put it down here.

1123
01:41:47,574 --> 01:41:48,607
Hey.

1124
01:41:48,774 --> 01:41:50,640
- Where's Lilya?
- She didn't come today.

1125
01:41:50,773 --> 01:41:53,006
- What?
- I'm serious.

1126
01:41:55,272 --> 01:41:57,972
I tried calling her too -
says "number unavailable".

1127
01:41:58,072 --> 01:41:59,938
Isn't she home?

1128
01:42:01,038 --> 01:42:02,671
Number unavailable.

1129
01:42:02,771 --> 01:42:04,670
OK, I’ll be off.

1130
01:42:05,770 --> 01:42:07,270
Can you give me a lift?

1131
01:42:07,769 --> 01:42:10,169
- What?
- Can I get a lift?

1132
01:42:10,269 --> 01:42:12,269
Oh, sure, get in.

1133
01:44:19,908 --> 01:44:22,640
She ran off to him. To Moscow.

1134
01:44:22,740 --> 01:44:24,940
I don't doubt it for a second.

1135
01:44:27,139 --> 01:44:29,339
What else could have happened?

1136
01:44:29,439 --> 01:44:32,572
Anything. Do you know
how many people go missing?

1137
01:44:32,705 --> 01:44:34,471
I don't believe in "anything".

1138
01:44:34,571 --> 01:44:36,405
What about the cops?

1139
01:44:37,104 --> 01:44:38,437
What about them?

1140
01:44:39,537 --> 01:44:41,336
Have to wait three days.

1141
01:44:41,436 --> 01:44:42,803
That's a bunch of shit.

1142
01:44:42,903 --> 01:44:44,436
You can report it right away.

1143
01:44:44,569 --> 01:44:48,702
Take it from the wife
of a law enforcement officer.

1144
01:44:49,035 --> 01:44:49,968
OK,

1145
01:44:50,468 --> 01:44:53,034
I go to the cops and tell them what?

1146
01:44:53,167 --> 01:44:56,200
"My wife ran off to Moscow
to her lover.

1147
01:44:56,333 --> 01:45:00,532
"Here's her name and number.
Get her back."

1148
01:45:01,399 --> 01:45:04,065
Hey, if you want,
I can call him right now.

1149
01:45:04,465 --> 01:45:06,131
I already tried over and over.

1150
01:45:06,231 --> 01:45:07,398
And?

1151
01:45:07,498 --> 01:45:09,564
Nothing. No answer.

1152
01:45:10,230 --> 01:45:12,263
We have to do something.

1153
01:45:19,395 --> 01:45:20,861
And I wouldn't be surprised

1154
01:45:20,995 --> 01:45:25,327
if he took my money
from that bastard and bailed.

1155
01:45:25,427 --> 01:45:27,693
And she joined him later.

1156
01:46:32,746 --> 01:46:34,245
Hi, Kolya.

1157
01:46:35,445 --> 01:46:36,579
Where's Roma?

1158
01:46:36,745 --> 01:46:38,511
He went home.

1159
01:46:39,411 --> 01:46:42,210
- When?
- About 20 minutes ago.

1160
01:47:44,130 --> 01:47:45,864
Get the door!

1161
01:48:12,458 --> 01:48:13,990
They found her.

1162
01:49:28,841 --> 01:49:30,541
Move away.

1163
01:49:31,574 --> 01:49:33,107
Come on.

1164
01:50:09,533 --> 01:50:10,799
Why?

1165
01:50:15,664 --> 01:50:17,564
Why, Lord?

1166
01:50:57,322 --> 01:50:58,488
What can I get you, Kolya?

1167
01:50:58,622 --> 01:51:00,854
Vodka, what else? 2 bottles.

1168
01:51:09,252 --> 01:51:10,719
Hello, Kolya.

1169
01:51:11,452 --> 01:51:13,352
Hey, Father Vasily.

1170
01:51:44,378 --> 01:51:45,812
Well?

1171
01:51:47,644 --> 01:51:49,144
Where's your...

1172
01:51:49,277 --> 01:51:52,310
merciful God Almighty?

1173
01:51:54,043 --> 01:51:55,810
Mine is with me.

1174
01:51:56,342 --> 01:51:58,375
As for yours, I wouldn't know.

1175
01:52:00,241 --> 01:52:02,175
Who do you pray to?

1176
01:52:03,674 --> 01:52:05,907
Haven't seen you in church.

1177
01:52:07,540 --> 01:52:10,239
You don't fast, take communion
or go to confession.

1178
01:52:10,339 --> 01:52:14,472
If I lit candles and all,
would things be different?

1179
01:52:14,638 --> 01:52:17,438
Maybe it's not too late to start?

1180
01:52:18,071 --> 01:52:20,304
Would I get my wife
back from the dead?

1181
01:52:20,437 --> 01:52:22,270
And my house?

1182
01:52:22,670 --> 01:52:24,403
Or is it too late?

1183
01:52:25,103 --> 01:52:26,336
I don't know.

1184
01:52:26,469 --> 01:52:28,869
Our Lord moves in mysterious ways.

1185
01:52:28,969 --> 01:52:30,735
You don't know?

1186
01:52:30,835 --> 01:52:34,501
Then why do you call me
to confession?

1187
01:52:36,201 --> 01:52:37,900
What do you know then?

1188
01:52:38,067 --> 01:52:40,133
- Want some?
- No.

1189
01:52:44,732 --> 01:52:47,565
"Can you pull in Leviathan
with a fishhook

1190
01:52:48,298 --> 01:52:50,998
"or tie down its tongue with a rope?

1191
01:52:51,630 --> 01:52:54,197
"Will it keep begging you for mercy?

1192
01:52:54,297 --> 01:52:57,629
"Will it speak to you
with gentle words?

1193
01:52:58,163 --> 01:53:00,596
"Nothing on earth is its equal.

1194
01:53:01,295 --> 01:53:03,428
"It is king over all that are proud."

1195
01:53:03,528 --> 01:53:05,027
Father Vasily...

1196
01:53:06,227 --> 01:53:08,760
I'm talking to you
as a regular person.

1197
01:53:08,894 --> 01:53:10,993
Why the fucking riddles?

1198
01:53:11,093 --> 01:53:12,626
What for?

1199
01:53:12,759 --> 01:53:15,659
Have you heard of a man called Job?

1200
01:53:16,092 --> 01:53:19,591
Like you, he was preoccupied
with the meaning of life.

1201
01:53:19,724 --> 01:53:22,424
"Why?" he asked.
"Why me of all people?"

1202
01:53:22,557 --> 01:53:25,690
He worried so much
he became covered with scabs.

1203
01:53:25,790 --> 01:53:29,589
His wife tried to talk some sense
into him; his friends told him

1204
01:53:30,056 --> 01:53:31,722
to not evoke God's anger.

1205
01:53:31,822 --> 01:53:35,688
But he kept kicking up dust
and sprinkling ash on his head.

1206
01:53:35,754 --> 01:53:38,654
Then the Lord relented

1207
01:53:38,787 --> 01:53:40,253
and appeared to him

1208
01:53:40,387 --> 01:53:42,387
in the form of a hurricane

1209
01:53:42,519 --> 01:53:45,652
and explained everything to him
in pictures.

1210
01:53:45,819 --> 01:53:46,952
And?

1211
01:53:47,452 --> 01:53:49,685
Job resigned himself to his fate

1212
01:53:49,785 --> 01:53:52,251
and lived to be 140.

1213
01:53:52,351 --> 01:53:56,384
Got to see 4 generations
of his family

1214
01:53:57,016 --> 01:53:59,116
and died old

1215
01:53:59,249 --> 01:54:00,415
and content.

1216
01:54:00,549 --> 01:54:02,082
Is that a fairy tale?

1217
01:54:05,648 --> 01:54:06,914
No,

1218
01:54:07,314 --> 01:54:09,347
it's in the Bible.

1219
01:54:09,481 --> 01:54:12,613
Let me help you carry that.
Come on.

1220
01:54:25,277 --> 01:54:26,510
Thanks.

1221
01:54:28,443 --> 01:54:32,176
The funeral service is tomorrow.
They just called.

1222
01:54:46,573 --> 01:54:48,672
Yulia, there's some bread for you.

1223
01:54:48,805 --> 01:54:50,072
God bless you.

1224
01:54:50,205 --> 01:54:52,504
Glory be to God. Eat up.

1225
01:55:08,834 --> 01:55:10,168
How terrible...

1226
01:55:14,733 --> 01:55:17,599
Do you think she did this herself?

1227
01:55:18,266 --> 01:55:20,065
The forensic tests will tell.

1228
01:55:26,864 --> 01:55:28,264
Remember

1229
01:55:29,130 --> 01:55:31,763
how Kolya threatened to kill her?

1230
01:55:31,896 --> 01:55:34,295
- Come on now.
- He did.

1231
01:55:34,462 --> 01:55:36,695
- So what?
- He could have done it.

1232
01:55:36,795 --> 01:55:39,128
He's capable, I swear.

1233
01:55:40,294 --> 01:55:41,927
- You hear me?
- What the hell?

1234
01:55:42,061 --> 01:55:44,393
- Did you hear me?
- I heard you.

1235
01:55:44,493 --> 01:55:47,360
- And?
- You're the cop. You tell me.

1236
01:55:49,092 --> 01:55:50,892
Use your brain.

1237
01:56:12,387 --> 01:56:13,520
Dad...

1238
01:56:15,653 --> 01:56:17,186
Will you ever stop drinking?

1239
01:56:17,286 --> 01:56:18,486
I will.

1240
01:56:19,553 --> 01:56:22,852
I'm quitting tomorrow.
You believe me?

1241
01:56:26,384 --> 01:56:27,684
Son...

1242
01:56:30,450 --> 01:56:33,082
Sit. Let's talk.

1243
01:56:33,216 --> 01:56:35,416
Forget it. I'm going out.

1244
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:45,480
All right.

1245
01:56:49,512 --> 01:56:50,712
Go.

1246
01:56:58,711 --> 01:57:01,876
- Hello.
- Hi. Is your dad home?

1247
01:57:02,010 --> 01:57:04,176
- He's asleep.
- I see.

1248
01:57:04,643 --> 01:57:06,342
- Hey, where are you going?
- Easy, easy.

1249
01:57:06,475 --> 01:57:09,108
- Dad! Some guys just barged in!
- Sit down and be quiet.

1250
01:57:09,208 --> 01:57:11,074
- What?
- Sit down, I said.

1251
01:57:11,208 --> 01:57:14,041
Get up. Homicide department.

1252
01:57:14,174 --> 01:57:16,373
You ignored the court order.

1253
01:57:16,507 --> 01:57:18,206
What court order?

1254
01:57:18,740 --> 01:57:20,039
This one.

1255
01:57:25,438 --> 01:57:27,038
Roma!

1256
01:57:27,138 --> 01:57:28,670
Sit down!

1257
01:57:45,534 --> 01:57:46,734
Dad!

1258
01:58:09,862 --> 01:58:13,328
We have every reason to believe
you killed your wife

1259
01:58:13,461 --> 01:58:15,528
and then faked her drowning.

1260
01:58:16,394 --> 01:58:17,427
What?

1261
01:58:19,193 --> 01:58:20,193
Are you crazy?

1262
01:58:22,092 --> 01:58:24,226
We discovered signs of violence
on the body.

1263
01:58:24,292 --> 01:58:26,691
She was murdered,
then pushed into the water.

1264
01:58:26,825 --> 01:58:29,524
She died from a blow
with a blunt object

1265
01:58:29,657 --> 01:58:31,757
to the back of her head.

1266
01:58:31,857 --> 01:58:35,323
Not long before that,
she had sexual intercourse.

1267
01:58:35,456 --> 01:58:38,589
The investigation is looking
into the possibility of rape.

1268
01:58:39,422 --> 01:58:42,355
We'll take your sperm for tests.
Something tells me

1269
01:58:42,522 --> 01:58:44,588
it will be a match.

1270
01:58:45,887 --> 01:58:47,221
Next,

1271
01:58:48,353 --> 01:58:52,386
we have testimony
from Angela Polivanova

1272
01:58:53,586 --> 01:58:56,919
and her husband, Pasha Polivanov

1273
01:58:57,718 --> 01:59:01,150
to the effect that a few days
prior to the murder,

1274
01:59:01,284 --> 01:59:03,050
while at a picnic,

1275
01:59:03,184 --> 01:59:05,649
you had a fight with your wife

1276
01:59:05,817 --> 01:59:08,183
and her lover in front of witnesses.

1277
01:59:08,316 --> 01:59:10,716
after you caught them having sex.

1278
01:59:10,882 --> 01:59:13,081
You beat up the lover,

1279
01:59:13,215 --> 01:59:14,581
a man called Dmitri,

1280
01:59:15,115 --> 01:59:16,981
whose identity
is currently being established,

1281
01:59:17,081 --> 01:59:21,113
then hit your wife, and afterwards
threatened to kill them both.

1282
01:59:21,746 --> 01:59:23,879
This testimony was confirmed

1283
01:59:25,179 --> 01:59:27,278
by Ivan Stepanych Degtyaryev,

1284
01:59:28,012 --> 01:59:30,678
Lieutenant Colonel
of the traffic police,

1285
01:59:30,844 --> 01:59:34,077
who was also present.

1286
01:59:35,110 --> 01:59:38,442
In addition,
the suspected murder weapon,

1287
01:59:38,542 --> 01:59:42,242
a hammer with the shape matching
that of the Victim's head wound,

1288
01:59:43,109 --> 01:59:47,708
was found in a building
on your property.

1289
01:59:47,840 --> 01:59:49,840
It has been taken for testing.

1290
01:59:50,307 --> 01:59:53,173
Would you like to comment
on any of this?

1291
01:59:54,206 --> 01:59:57,238
Personally, I would advise you

1292
01:59:57,938 --> 01:59:59,738
to write a full confession.

1293
01:59:59,838 --> 02:00:02,104
We have more than enough evidence.

1294
02:00:02,204 --> 02:00:04,970
A confession may reduce the sentence.

1295
02:00:05,470 --> 02:00:07,670
Pursuant to Article 105 Part 1,

1296
02:00:08,170 --> 02:00:11,302
you'll get up to 15 years

1297
02:00:11,402 --> 02:00:13,868
unless there are
aggravating circumstances,

1298
02:00:13,968 --> 02:00:17,068
in which case,
it'll be up to 20 years.

1299
02:00:20,101 --> 02:00:21,467
Right...

1300
02:00:22,400 --> 02:00:25,299
In any case,
we're detaining you for 48 hours

1301
02:00:25,399 --> 02:00:27,399
as a murder suspect.

1302
02:00:28,399 --> 02:00:31,565
I'll petition the court
for a warrant for your arrest

1303
02:00:31,698 --> 02:00:36,763
as a flight risk and as someone
who might impede the investigation.

1304
02:00:43,662 --> 02:00:44,862
Also...

1305
02:00:45,428 --> 02:00:48,327
you have the right to a lawyer.

1306
02:00:48,461 --> 02:00:50,827
If you don't have a lawyer,

1307
02:00:50,927 --> 02:00:52,993
the state will appoint one for you.

1308
02:00:53,893 --> 02:00:55,559
Do you understand?

1309
02:00:58,859 --> 02:01:01,025
I don't understand any of this.

1310
02:01:01,792 --> 02:01:04,024
You'll have plenty of time
to think it over.

1311
02:01:53,647 --> 02:01:55,613
- Hello.
- Just one?

1312
02:01:55,713 --> 02:01:57,146
Just one.

1313
02:02:02,045 --> 02:02:03,245
Listen...

1314
02:02:04,678 --> 02:02:08,110
My son's left all alone.

1315
02:02:09,377 --> 02:02:10,809
We've got no relatives.

1316
02:02:10,943 --> 02:02:12,343
Don't shit yourself.

1317
02:02:13,043 --> 02:02:15,208
The state will take care of him.

1318
02:03:11,596 --> 02:03:14,296
Roma, open up.
It's Angela and Pasha.

1319
02:03:14,429 --> 02:03:15,995
Are you alone?

1320
02:03:16,095 --> 02:03:17,262
Yes, it's just us.

1321
02:03:23,194 --> 02:03:24,661
How are you?

1322
02:03:25,161 --> 02:03:26,493
I'm all right.

1323
02:03:27,160 --> 02:03:30,259
Why didn't you call me
when they took your dad?

1324
02:03:31,192 --> 02:03:33,092
I don't have your number.

1325
02:03:35,825 --> 02:03:38,024
How long have you
been here alone?

1326
02:03:38,158 --> 02:03:39,358
I don't know.

1327
02:03:40,224 --> 02:03:42,290
5 days, I think.

1328
02:03:43,623 --> 02:03:44,823
Roma...

1329
02:03:46,256 --> 02:03:48,256
A lawyer called.

1330
02:03:49,355 --> 02:03:52,055
Your dad was accused
of murdering Lilya.

1331
02:03:52,955 --> 02:03:57,054
He'll be in jail till the trial.
Then, they'll take him to prison.

1332
02:03:58,286 --> 02:04:00,053
They have proof.

1333
02:04:00,153 --> 02:04:01,519
That's not true.

1334
02:04:01,619 --> 02:04:03,552
Why would I lie to you?

1335
02:04:05,818 --> 02:04:09,084
Why didn't he call me?
They must let him call me.

1336
02:04:09,184 --> 02:04:10,784
Look, Roma,

1337
02:04:11,583 --> 02:04:14,783
the lawyer said that
if there's no one to take care of you,

1338
02:04:14,883 --> 02:04:16,582
they'll put you in an orphanage.

1339
02:04:17,416 --> 02:04:19,515
I can take care of myself.

1340
02:04:19,615 --> 02:04:22,648
By law, until you turn 18,

1341
02:04:22,781 --> 02:04:26,114
you must live
in an orphanage or with a guardian.

1342
02:04:27,047 --> 02:04:29,247
Pasha and I talked it over...

1343
02:04:29,879 --> 02:04:32,179
We'd like to be your guardians.

1344
02:04:32,279 --> 02:04:34,178
You've got no one else, right?

1345
02:04:40,244 --> 02:04:41,644
Is it because of the money?

1346
02:04:42,244 --> 02:04:43,576
What money?

1347
02:04:43,676 --> 02:04:45,376
Won't you get paid for it?

1348
02:04:45,476 --> 02:04:47,276
How should I know?

1349
02:04:48,775 --> 02:04:52,242
But if you agree,
I'll definitely find out.

1350
02:04:52,375 --> 02:04:55,341
I guess the state
would probably help out,

1351
02:04:56,041 --> 02:04:58,073
but that's not why we're offering.

1352
02:04:58,640 --> 02:05:00,273
Why then?

1353
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:02,806
I don't know.

1354
02:05:04,139 --> 02:05:05,439
You're like...

1355
02:05:06,139 --> 02:05:07,671
family to us.

1356
02:05:08,371 --> 02:05:10,004
Your mum and I were friends.

1357
02:05:10,138 --> 02:05:13,170
You were little when she died.

1358
02:05:14,503 --> 02:05:18,602
I went to school with your parents.
And Lilya. She was a bit younger.

1359
02:05:30,566 --> 02:05:32,200
I'll step out for a smoke.

1360
02:07:32,040 --> 02:07:35,107
Pribrezhny Town Court
has ruled as follows:

1361
02:07:35,239 --> 02:07:38,839
The Panel of Judges,

1362
02:07:38,939 --> 02:07:44,505
presided over by Mrs Tarasova,
examined Mr Sergeyev's petition

1363
02:07:44,605 --> 02:07:47,537
to appeal the ruling
on case No. 06-18.

1364
02:07:47,670 --> 02:07:51,436
In the presence of Mr Sergeyev,
the court has determined that:

1365
02:07:51,569 --> 02:07:54,402
Mr Sergeyev,
who has no previous convictions,

1366
02:07:54,535 --> 02:07:57,902
is convicted in accordance
with Article 105 of the Criminal Code

1367
02:07:58,002 --> 02:08:01,567
and sentenced to 15 years
in a maximum-security penitentiary.

1368
02:08:01,701 --> 02:08:04,467
The ruling also addressed
evidence in the case:

1369
02:08:04,567 --> 02:08:09,199
Mr Sergeyev was convicted
of premeditated murder of his wife.

1370
02:08:09,299 --> 02:08:12,998
The circumstances of the crime
are outlined in the ruling.

1371
02:08:13,098 --> 02:08:15,631
Mr Sergeyev refused
to confess to the crime.

1372
02:08:15,764 --> 02:08:20,197
He filed an appeal requesting
that the ruling be repealed.

1373
02:08:20,297 --> 02:08:24,396
Mr Sergeyev claims that his guilt
in the case was not proven.

1374
02:08:24,529 --> 02:08:29,461
The court considers the ruling
not subject to repeal.

1375
02:08:29,895 --> 02:08:33,094
All circumstances
were thoroughly examined by the court

1376
02:08:33,227 --> 02:08:35,426
and all evidence
given due consideration.

1377
02:08:35,560 --> 02:08:39,093
The defendant's claim of innocence
was reviewed by the court

1378
02:08:39,225 --> 02:08:40,425
and soundly rejected.

1379
02:09:01,921 --> 02:09:03,220
Hello?

1380
02:09:07,687 --> 02:09:09,319
15 years?

1381
02:09:09,453 --> 02:09:11,219
Well, thank God.

1382
02:09:11,352 --> 02:09:13,985
That'll teach him to know his place.

1383
02:09:15,385 --> 02:09:17,184
Yeah, later.

1384
02:09:23,116 --> 02:09:24,549
One more.

1385
02:09:44,111 --> 02:09:49,278
We probably don't even realise yet
what is really happening.

1386
02:09:50,044 --> 02:09:52,410
We are reawakening

1387
02:09:53,210 --> 02:09:55,643
the soul of the Russian people.

1388
02:09:56,676 --> 02:10:01,541
As the Great Prince
St. Alexander Nevsky

1389
02:10:01,675 --> 02:10:03,974
wonderfully put it:

1390
02:10:04,074 --> 02:10:07,774
"God dwells not in strength,
but in truth."

1391
02:10:07,874 --> 02:10:11,639
And he was right:
not with strength, but with love;

1392
02:10:11,739 --> 02:10:13,472
not with cunning,

1393
02:10:13,572 --> 02:10:15,838
but with the Lord's wisdom;

1394
02:10:15,938 --> 02:10:19,104
not with anger and hatred,
but with bravery

1395
02:10:19,237 --> 02:10:23,637
have we overcome the many enemies
of our faith and our Motherland.

1396
02:10:24,736 --> 02:10:27,969
But the most important thing today

1397
02:10:28,802 --> 02:10:31,169
is that we must

1398
02:10:31,301 --> 02:10:33,368
uphold the Orthodox faith

1399
02:10:33,468 --> 02:10:35,668
and always speak truthfully.

1400
02:10:36,167 --> 02:10:37,700
Truth

1401
02:10:37,833 --> 02:10:40,299
is God's legacy.

1402
02:10:40,399 --> 02:10:45,098
Truth reflects the world
as it really is, without distortion.

1403
02:10:45,832 --> 02:10:50,964
But only he who knows God's truth
can find truth.

1404
02:10:51,064 --> 02:10:54,863
And God's truth
is Christ Himself.

1405
02:10:54,996 --> 02:10:57,496
This is why, when Apostle Paul said,

1406
02:10:57,596 --> 02:11:01,028
"I no longer live,
but Christ lives in me"

1407
02:11:02,228 --> 02:11:06,061
he meant that when a man
lets Christ into his soul -

1408
02:11:06,761 --> 02:11:09,193
in other words,
begins to think like Christ,

1409
02:11:09,293 --> 02:11:10,960
see like Christ

1410
02:11:11,060 --> 02:11:14,292
and act like the Lord commanded -

1411
02:11:14,392 --> 02:11:18,725
only then does this man
possess truth.

1412
02:11:19,424 --> 02:11:21,990
And that means he can regard events

1413
02:11:22,890 --> 02:11:25,190
and see their true meaning

1414
02:11:25,290 --> 02:11:28,589
and tell good from evil.

1415
02:11:28,722 --> 02:11:32,088
And that is the essence of truth.

1416
02:11:32,188 --> 02:11:36,254
When people destroy crosses,

1417
02:11:36,321 --> 02:11:40,186
break icons, defile the Crucifix

1418
02:11:41,120 --> 02:11:44,119
and blaspheme by calling
demonic rites a prayer,

1419
02:11:44,253 --> 02:11:47,085
when people try to convince others

1420
02:11:47,218 --> 02:11:50,184
that they do this
out of good intentions,

1421
02:11:50,284 --> 02:11:52,017
they are passing off lies

1422
02:11:52,151 --> 02:11:54,483
as the truth.

1423
02:11:54,583 --> 02:11:56,350
How can one

1424
02:11:56,483 --> 02:12:00,316
preach freedom
while destroying the foundations

1425
02:12:00,416 --> 02:12:02,482
of morality?

1426
02:12:02,582 --> 02:12:06,381
Freedom is finding God's truth.

1427
02:12:06,514 --> 02:12:09,180
The Bible teaches us this.

1428
02:12:09,314 --> 02:12:13,346
Know God's truth,
and it shall set you free.

1429
02:12:15,279 --> 02:12:19,312
Only man who knows God's truth,
who lives by it,

1430
02:12:19,412 --> 02:12:21,377
who defends it -

1431
02:12:21,477 --> 02:12:24,011
only that man is truly free.

1432
02:12:25,244 --> 02:12:29,709
My beloved brothers and sisters
in Christ!

1433
02:12:29,843 --> 02:12:35,308
The world today is constantly
changing its reference points.

1434
02:12:35,942 --> 02:12:38,441
True values

1435
02:12:38,974 --> 02:12:41,173
are being replaced with false ones.

1436
02:12:41,307 --> 02:12:44,540
But even in this world,

1437
02:12:45,472 --> 02:12:49,139
our path remains unchanged:
it leads to Christ.

1438
02:12:49,271 --> 02:12:53,338
We know that the Church
will protect and guide us

1439
02:12:53,471 --> 02:12:57,103
but the Church consists
of you and me.

1440
02:12:57,203 --> 02:12:58,737
God is with us.

1441
02:12:58,837 --> 02:13:01,636
Truth is with us.
The Lord's love is with us...

1442
02:13:03,236 --> 02:13:05,468
God sees everything, son.

1443
02:13:05,568 --> 02:13:10,400
And in defending our faith, we will
not liken ourselves to our enemies

1444
02:13:10,500 --> 02:13:12,034
but just as Christ

1445
02:13:12,167 --> 02:13:16,133
shed light on the truth
and unmasked the lies with one word,

1446
02:13:16,266 --> 02:13:19,798
so will we,
enlightened by the Church,

1447
02:13:20,332 --> 02:13:23,064
the World of God and saintly prayer

1448
02:13:23,164 --> 02:13:25,331
defend the Orthodox faith.

1449
02:13:26,631 --> 02:13:28,963
I'm so glad
that you're pleased, sir.

1450
02:13:29,063 --> 02:13:31,262
Thanks a lot. We try.

1451
02:13:35,029 --> 02:13:38,428
It's not quite finished yet,
but it will be soon.

1452
02:13:39,194 --> 02:13:43,260
We'll do some landscaping,
maybe build a refectory.

1453
02:13:43,360 --> 02:13:46,259
As soon as it's all finished,
I'll call you right away.

1454
02:13:47,259 --> 02:13:50,225
- I have every faith in you.
- Thank you so much.

1455
02:13:50,925 --> 02:13:52,291
Where's my family?

1456
02:13:52,425 --> 02:13:54,725
Come on, sweetie, get in the car.
