1
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:57,702
It is an extremely
common mistake,

2
00:01:57,911 --> 00:02:01,080
people think the writer's
imagination is always at work,

3
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:03,917
that he's constantly
inventing an endless supply

4
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:06,085
of incidents and episodes,

5
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:09,964
that he simply dreams up
his stories out of thin air.

6
00:02:10,173 --> 00:02:12,842
In point of fact,
the opposite is true.

7
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:15,011
Once the public
knows you're a writer,

8
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:17,889
they bring the characters
and events to you

9
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:20,767
and as long as you maintain
your ability to look

10
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:23,311
and to carefully listen,

11
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:26,105
these stories
will continue to...

12
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:28,900
Stop it. Stop it! Don't! Don't do it!

13
00:02:33,947 --> 00:02:38,576
Uh, will continue to seek
you out over your lifetime.

14
00:02:38,785 --> 00:02:42,121
To him who has often
told the tales of others,

15
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,957
many tales will be told.

16
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:45,917
Sorry.
It's all right.

17
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:49,170
The incidents that follow
were described to me

18
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,382
exactly as I present them here

19
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,968
and in a wholly unexpected way.

20
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:03,768
<i>A number of years ago,</i>

21
00:03:03,977 --> 00:03:06,854
<i>while suffering from a mild
case of "Scribe's Fever,"</i>

22
00:03:07,063 --> 00:03:08,856
a <i>form of neurasthenia
common among</i>

23
00:03:08,982 --> 00:03:10,775
<i>the intelligentsia of that time,</i>

24
00:03:10,984 --> 00:03:12,860
<i>I decided to spend
the month of August</i>

25
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:16,990
<i>in the spa town of Nebelsbad
below the Alpine Sudetenwaltz,</i>

26
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:20,535
<i>and had taken up rooms
in the Grand Budapest,</i>

27
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:25,581
<i>a picturesque, elaborate, and once
widely celebrated establishment.</i>

28
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,334
<i>I expect some of
you will know it.</i>

29
00:03:30,086 --> 00:03:33,339
<i>YOUNG</i> WRITER: <i>It was off season and, by
that time, decidedly out of fashion,</i>

30
00:03:33,423 --> 00:03:35,466
<i>and it had already
begun its descent</i>

31
00:03:35,675 --> 00:03:39,679
<i>into shabbiness and
eventual demolition.</i>

32
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,597
<i>What few guests we were</i>

33
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:44,142
<i>had quickly come to recognize
one another by sight</i>

34
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,395
<i>as the only living souls residing
in the vast establishment,</i>

35
00:03:48,646 --> 00:03:51,649
<i>although I do not believe any acquaintance
among our number had proceeded</i>

36
00:03:51,858 --> 00:03:54,736
<i>beyond the polite nods
we exchanged as we passed</i>

37
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:55,820
<i>in the Palm Court,</i>

38
00:03:56,029 --> 00:03:57,864
<i>in the Arabian baths,</i>

39
00:03:58,072 --> 00:04:00,241
<i>and on board
the Colonnade Funicular.</i>

40
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,327
We were a very reserved
group, <i>it</i> seemed,

41
00:04:03,536 --> 00:04:05,997
<i>and, without exception,
solitary.</i>

42
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:13,129
<i>Perhaps as a result of
this general silence,</i>

43
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:16,132
<i>I had established a casual
and bantering familiarity</i>

44
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,342
<i>with the hotel's concierge,
a West-continental</i>

45
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:20,553
<i>known only as Monsieur Jean,</i>

46
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:22,597
<i>who struck one
as being, at once,</i>

47
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,933
<i>both lazy and, really,
quite accommodating.</i>

48
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,311
<i>I expect he was not well paid.</i>

49
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,937
In any case, one evening,

50
00:04:30,146 --> 00:04:32,607
<i>as I stood conferring
elbow-to-elbow with Monsieur Jean,</i>

51
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:37,153
<i>as had become my habit, I noticed
a new presence in our company.</i>

52
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:39,739
<i>A small, elderly man,
smartly dressed,</i>

53
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:42,867
<i>with an exceptionally lively,
intelligent face</i>

54
00:04:43,076 --> 00:04:46,079
<i>and an immediately perceptible
air of sadness.</i>

55
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:49,665
<i>He was, like the rest of us,
alone, but also, I must say,</i>

56
00:04:49,874 --> 00:04:54,420
<i>he was the first that struck one
as being deeply and truly lonely.</i>

57
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:57,298
<i>A symptom of my own
medical condition as well.</i>

58
00:04:57,507 --> 00:04:59,383
Who's this interesting
old fellow?

59
00:04:59,592 --> 00:05:01,177
<i>I inquired of Monsieur Jean.</i>

60
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:04,013
<i>To my surprise,
he was distinctly taken aback.</i>

61
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:05,473
Don't you know?
He <i>asked.</i>

62
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:07,433
Don't you recognize him?

63
00:05:07,642 --> 00:05:09,018
<i>He did look familiar.</i>

64
00:05:09,227 --> 00:05:11,312
That's Mr. Moustafa himself.

65
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:12,939
He arrived earlier this morning.

66
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,358
<i>This name will no
doubt be familiar</i>

67
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:18,236
<i>to the more seasoned
persons among you.</i>

68
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:24,909
<i>Mr. Zero Moustafa was at one time
the richest man in Zubrowka,</i>

69
00:05:26,661 --> 00:05:30,248
<i>and was still indeed the owner
of the Grand Budapest.</i>

70
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,417
He often comes and
stays a week or more,

71
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:35,753
three times a year at least,
but never in the season.

72
00:05:35,962 --> 00:05:38,297
<i>Monsieur Jean signaled to me
and I leaned closer.</i>

73
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:39,549
I'll tell you a secret.

74
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:42,093
He takes only a single-bed
sleeping room without a bath

75
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:44,053
in the rear corner
of the top floor

76
00:05:44,262 --> 00:05:46,180
and it's smaller than
the service elevator!

77
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:47,723
<i>It was well known,</i>

78
00:05:47,974 --> 00:05:50,476
<i>Zero Moustafa had purchased
and famously inhabited</i>

79
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:53,604
<i>some of the most lavish castles
and palazzos on the continent.</i>

80
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:57,108
<i>Yet here, in his own
nearly empty hotel,</i>

81
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:59,819
<i>he occupied
a servant's quarters?</i>

82
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,696
<i>At that moment, the curtain rose</i>

83
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:03,281
<i>on a parenthetical,
domestic drama...</i>

84
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:04,657
Shit.

85
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:07,743
<i>Which required the immediate
and complete attention</i>

86
00:06:07,952 --> 00:06:09,912
of Monsieur Jean,

87
00:06:11,664 --> 00:06:14,125
<i>but, frankly,
did not hold mine for long.</i>

88
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:22,425
However,

89
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:25,261
<i>this premature intermission in the
story of the curious, old man</i>

90
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:27,889
<i>had left me,
as the expression goes,</i>

91
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:30,224
"gespannt wie ein Flitzebogen,"

92
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:32,727
<i>that is, on the edge of my seat,</i>

93
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:35,813
<i>where I remained throughout
the next morning, until,</i>

94
00:06:36,022 --> 00:06:39,775
<i>in what I have found to be its
mysterious and utterly reliable fashion,</i>

95
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:43,863
<i>fate, once again,
intervened on my behalf.</i>

96
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:49,785
MR. MOUSTAFA:
I admire your work.

97
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:54,415
I beg your pardon?

98
00:06:56,167 --> 00:07:00,296
I said, I know and admire
your wonderful work.

99
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:03,090
Thank you most kindly, sir.

100
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:05,551
Did Monsieur Jean have a word
or two to share with you

101
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:09,347
about the aged proprietor
of this establishment?

102
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:14,060
I must confess, I did
myself inquire about you.

103
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,854
He's perfectly capable,
of course, Monsieur Jean

104
00:07:17,063 --> 00:07:18,814
but we can't claim he's a first,

105
00:07:19,023 --> 00:07:21,692
or, in earnest,
even second-rate concierge.

106
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:23,027
But there it is.

107
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:25,738
Times have changed.

108
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:31,953
The thermal baths
are very beautiful.

109
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:33,704
They were in their
first condition.

110
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:35,456
It couldn't be maintained,
of course.

111
00:07:35,623 --> 00:07:37,375
Too decadent for current tastes.

112
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:42,255
But I love it all just the same,
this enchanting old ruin.

113
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:45,883
How did you come to
buy it, if I may ask?

114
00:07:46,092 --> 00:07:48,094
The Grand Budapest.

115
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:58,854
I didn't.

116
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:10,324
If you're not
merely being polite,

117
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:13,244
and you must tell me
if that's the case,

118
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:16,455
but if it genuinely
does interest you,

119
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:19,000
may I invite you to
dine with me tonight,

120
00:08:19,292 --> 00:08:23,004
and it will be my pleasure and,
indeed, my privilege to tell you

121
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:26,632
"my story."
Such as it is.

122
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,807
Two ducks roasted with olives.

123
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:37,393
Rabbit, salad?
Mmm.

124
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:40,313
Pouilly-Jouvet '52,
plus a split of the brut.

125
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:44,650
That should
provide us ample time

126
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:45,943
if I commence promptly.

127
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:47,153
By all means.

128
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:12,511
Well, it begins, as it must, with
our mutual friend's predecessor.

129
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,931
The beloved, original concierge
of The Grand Budapest.

130
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:19,393
It begins, of course, with...

131
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:43,876
Bring the table to the window.
Yes, Monsieur Gustave.

132
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:46,545
Bring the tray to the table.
Right away, Monsieur Gustave.

133
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:49,090
Right there. Have those
been brushed and blocked?

134
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:51,092
Of course, Monsieur Gustave.
Pack them in the hat boxes.

135
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:52,496
Is that from
Oberstdorf & Company?

136
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,469
I believe so, Monsieur Gustave.

137
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:55,346
Second trunk. Who has the tickets?
I do, Monsieur Gustave.

138
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,431
Give them to me.

139
00:09:58,474 --> 00:10:00,601
These are in order.
Wait in the corner.

140
00:10:08,818 --> 00:10:09,944
I'm not leaving.

141
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:11,195
I beg your pardon?

142
00:10:11,404 --> 00:10:13,406
I'm not leaving.
Why not?

143
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,533
I'm frightened.
Of what?

144
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:17,942
I fear this may be the last
time we ever see each other.

145
00:10:18,077 --> 00:10:19,620
Why on earth would
that be the case?

146
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:22,039
Well, I can't put it
into words, but I feel it.

147
00:10:22,248 --> 00:10:23,499
For goodness sake,
there's no reason

148
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:24,864
for you to leave us if you'd...

149
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,460
Come with me.

150
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:28,045
To fucking Lutz?

151
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:30,339
Please.
Give me your hand.

152
00:10:32,383 --> 00:10:35,469
You've nothing to fear. You're
always anxious before you travel.

153
00:10:35,553 --> 00:10:36,971
I admit, you appear
to be suffering

154
00:10:37,096 --> 00:10:38,536
a more acute attack
on this occasion.

155
00:10:38,556 --> 00:10:39,974
But, truly and honestly...
Oh, dear God.

156
00:10:40,099 --> 00:10:41,517
What have you done
to your fingernails?

157
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,436
I beg your pardon? This
diabolical varnish.

158
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:45,521
The color is completely wrong.
Don't you like it?

159
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:48,524
It's not that I don't like it.
I am physically repulsed.

160
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,068
Perhaps this will soothe you.

161
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:52,820
What? Don't recite.

162
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:54,228
Just listen to
the words. Hush.

163
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:55,322
Please. Not now.

164
00:10:55,865 --> 00:10:59,410
"While questing once in noble
wood of gray, medieval pine,

165
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:03,789
"I came upon a tomb, rain-slick'd,
rubbed-cool, ethereal,

"yet still within its
melancholy fissures..."

MADAME D.: Will you light
a candle for me, please?

169
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,049
In the sacristy of Santa Maria?

170
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:15,935
GUSTAVE H: I'll see to it
myself immediately.

171
00:11:16,594 --> 00:11:20,014
Remember, I'm always with you.

172
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:22,266
I love you.

173
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:23,726
I love you.

174
00:11:35,446 --> 00:11:37,823
It's quite a thing winning the
loyalty of a woman like that

175
00:11:38,032 --> 00:11:40,034
for 19 consecutive seasons.

176
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:42,203
Um... Yes, sir.

177
00:11:42,328 --> 00:11:44,163
She's very fond of me, you know.

178
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:45,331
Yes, sir.

179
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,458
But I've never seen
her like that before.

180
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:48,667
No, sir.

181
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:51,128
She was shaking
like a shitting dog.

182
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:53,547
Truly.

183
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:56,133
Run to the cathedral of Santa
Maria in Brucknerplatz.

184
00:11:56,342 --> 00:11:58,052
Buy one of the plain,
half-length candles

185
00:11:58,135 --> 00:11:59,615
and take back four
Klubecks in change.

186
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:01,597
Light it in the sacristy,
say a brief rosary

187
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,933
then go to Mendl's and get me
a courtesan au chocolat.

188
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:06,741
If there's any money left, give it
to the crippled shoe-shine boy.

189
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:09,480
Right away, sir.

190
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:10,606
Hold it.

191
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,652
Who are you?

192
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:16,529
I'm Zero, sir.
The new Lobby Boy.

193
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:17,947
Zero, you say?
Yes, sir.

194
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,406
I've never heard of you,
never laid eyes on you.

195
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,491
Who hired you?

196
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:21,825
Mr. Mosher, sir.

197
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:23,118
Mr. Mosher!

198
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,454
Yes, Monsieur Gustave?

199
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:28,290
Am I to understand you've
surreptitiously hired this young man

200
00:12:28,374 --> 00:12:29,667
in the position of a Lobby Boy?

201
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,627
He's been engaged
for a trial period,

202
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:33,462
pending your approval,
of course.

203
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:34,838
Uh...

204
00:12:34,964 --> 00:12:37,341
Perhaps, yes.
Thank you, Mr. Mosher.

205
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:39,802
You're most welcome,
Monsieur Gustave.

206
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:42,680
You're now going to be
officially interviewed.

207
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:45,057
Should I go and light
the candle first, sir?

208
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:46,517
What? No.

209
00:12:50,271 --> 00:12:51,313
Experience?

210
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:53,649
Hotel Kinski,
Kitchen Boy, six months.

211
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:56,026
Hotel Berlitz, Mop and
Broom Boy, three months.

212
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:57,570
Before that I was
a Skillet Scrubber...

213
00:12:57,695 --> 00:12:59,029
Experience, zero.

214
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:00,114
Thank you again,
Monsieur Gustave.

215
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:01,198
Straighten that cap, Anatole.

216
00:13:01,282 --> 00:13:03,158
The pleasure's mine, <i>Herr</i> Schneider.
The strap's busted.

217
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:05,119
These are not acceptable.
I fully agree.

218
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:06,537
Education?

219
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:07,913
I studied reading and spelling.

220
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:10,374
I started my primary school.
I almost...

221
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:11,584
Education, zero.

222
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:12,751
Now it's exploded.

223
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:15,004
Good morning, Cicero.
Call the goddamn plumber!

224
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:16,367
This afternoon,
Monsieur Gustave?

225
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,506
Without fail, Frau Liebling.

226
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,174
What in hell is this? Not now.

227
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:21,343
Family?

228
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:25,598
Zero.

229
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,808
Six, Igor.

230
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:37,067
Why do you want
to be a Lobby Boy?

231
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:43,532
Well, who wouldn't,
at the Grand Budapest, sir?

232
00:13:43,741 --> 00:13:45,743
It's an institution.

233
00:13:48,621 --> 00:13:50,205
Very good.

234
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:06,513
A thousand Klubecks.

235
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,681
My goodness.

236
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:11,727
Were you ever a Lobby Boy, sir?

237
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:12,936
What do you think?

238
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:15,064
Well, I suppose you'd have
to start somewhere...

239
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:16,940
Go and light the goddamn candle.
Yes, sir.

240
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:24,156
<i>MR. MOUSTAFA:
And so, my life began.</i>

241
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,285
<i>Junior Lobby Boy in-training,</i>

242
00:14:28,494 --> 00:14:29,912
<i>Grand Budapest Hotel,</i>

243
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,290
<i>under the strict command
of Monsieur Gustave H.</i>

244
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:36,627
<i>I became his pupil, and he was
to be my counselor and guardian.</i>

245
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:38,545
<i>GUSTAVE H:
What is</i> a <i>Lobby Boy?</i>

246
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:42,132
<i>A Lobby Boy's completely
invisible, yet always in sight.</i>

247
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:44,385
<i>A Lobby Boy remembers
what people hate.</i>

248
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:46,387
<i>A Lobby Boy anticipates
the client's needs</i>

249
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:48,680
<i>before the needs are needed.</i>

250
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,975
<i>A Lobby Boy is, above all,
discreet to a fault.</i>

251
00:14:52,184 --> 00:14:54,269
Our guests know
their deepest secrets,

252
00:14:54,353 --> 00:14:55,938
some of which are,
frankly, rather unseemly,

253
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:57,856
will go with us to our graves.

254
00:14:58,065 --> 00:14:59,316
So keep your mouth shut, Zero.

255
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:00,692
Yes, sir.

256
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,780
That's all for now.

257
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:06,907
<i>MR. MOUSTAFA: I began to realize
that many of the hotel's</i>

258
00:15:07,116 --> 00:15:10,828
<i>most valued and distinguished
guests came for him.</i>

259
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:12,663
<i>It seemed to be an essential
part of his duties...</i>

260
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,081
Ah!

261
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:16,417
<i>But I believe it
was also his pleasure.</i>

262
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:20,462
<i>The requirements
were always the same.</i>

263
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:23,132
<i>They had to be rich,</i>

264
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,425
<i>old,</i>

265
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:25,801
insecure,

266
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,052
<i>vain,</i>

267
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:28,512
<i>superficial,</i>

268
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,805
<i>blonde,</i>

269
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:31,515
needy.

270
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,726
Why blonde?

271
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:38,147
Because they all were.

272
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:39,731
<i>He was, by the way,</i>

273
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,527
<i>the most liberally perfumed
man I had ever encountered.</i>

274
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:46,572
<i>The scent announced his
approach from a great distance</i>

275
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:50,576
<i>and lingered for many minutes
after he was gone.</i>

276
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:55,456
<i>I worked six days each week
plus a half-day Sunday,</i>

277
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:57,916
<i>5:00 AM until
just after midnight.</i>

278
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:01,670
<i>Our meals were small but
frequent, for stamina.</i>

279
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:04,673
<i>Two breakfasts, two lunches
and a late supper.</i>

280
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:09,094
<i>Monsieur Gustave also
delivered</i> a <i>nightly sermon.</i>

281
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:12,389
Rudeness is merely
the expression of fear.

282
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:14,808
People fear they
won't get what they want.

283
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:18,520
The most dreadful and unattractive
person only needs to be loved,

284
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:21,148
and they will open
up like a flower.

285
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:22,941
I am reminded of a verse,

286
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,569
"The painter's brush
touched the inchoate face

287
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,738
"by ends of nimble bristles

288
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:29,823
"and with their
blush of first color,

289
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,825
"rendered her
lifeless cheek living."

290
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:35,078
<i>MR. MOUSTAFA: His own dinner,
he took alone in his room.</i>

291
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:44,463
<i>The identity of the owner of the
hotel was unknown to all of us.</i>

292
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:48,467
<i>Each month, his emissary, known
as Deputy Kovacs, arrived</i>

293
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,511
<i>to review the books
and convey messages</i>

294
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:53,222
<i>on behalf of
the mysterious proprietor.</i>

295
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,391
<i>On these occasions, Monsieur
Gustave and our business manager,</i>

296
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,103
<i>Herr Becker, met with him in private
consultation above Reception.</i>

297
00:17:12,908 --> 00:17:15,369
<i>This was also when I met Agatha,</i>

298
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:35,556
<i>but we won't discuss that.</i>

299
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:27,482
What do you want?
Look.

300
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:33,739
GUSTAVE H: Dear God.

301
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:35,198
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

302
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:36,408
We must go to her.

303
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:37,492
We must?

304
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:39,328
Tout de suite.
She needs me, and I need

305
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:41,163
you to help me with
my bags and so on.

306
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:44,833
How fast can you pack?
Five minutes.

307
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:47,042
Do it. And bring a bottle
of the Pouilly-Jouvet '26

308
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:48,365
in an ice bucket
with two glasses

309
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:51,340
so we don't have to drink the cat
piss they serve in the dining car.

310
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,517
I blame myself.

311
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:06,563
She tried to tell me she had a premonition.
I didn't listen.

312
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:08,357
All of Lutz will
be dressed in black,

313
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,484
except her own ghastly,
deceitful children

314
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,736
whom she loathed and
couldn't bear to kiss hello.

315
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:15,238
They'll be dancing like gypsies.

316
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:20,327
There's really no point
in doing anything in life,

317
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,287
because it's all over
in the blink of an eye...

318
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:25,374
And, the next thing you know,
rigor mortis sets in.

319
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:28,418
Oh, how the good die young.

320
00:19:28,627 --> 00:19:31,588
With any luck, she's left a few
Klubecks for your old friend,

321
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:33,340
but one never knows
until the ink

322
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:35,050
is dry on the death certificate.

323
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:38,387
She was dynamite in the sack,
by the way.

324
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,766
<i>She was 84, Monsieur Gustave.</i>

325
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:44,434
I've had older.

326
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:46,228
When you're young,
it's all fillet steak,

327
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:49,439
but as the years go by, you have
to move on to the cheaper cuts,

328
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:51,900
which is fine with me,
because I like those.

329
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:54,361
More flavorful, or so they say.

330
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:59,741
Why are we stopping
at a barley field?

331
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:16,675
Well, hello there, chaps.

332
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:18,301
Documents, please.

333
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,512
With pleasure.

334
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,479
It's not a very flattering
portrait, I'm afraid.

335
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:28,311
I was once considered
a great beauty.

336
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:31,982
What does the "F" stand for?
Fritz? Franz?

337
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,442
Franz.

338
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:34,776
I knew it!

339
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:38,029
He's making a funny face.

340
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,825
That's a Migratory Visa with Stage
Three Worker Status, Franz, darling.

341
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:44,119
He's with me.

342
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:45,996
Come outside, please.

343
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:50,459
Now, wait a minute. Sit down, Zero.
His papers are in order.

344
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,127
I cross-referenced
them myself with

345
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:53,670
the Bureau of
Labor and Servitude.

346
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:55,714
You can't arrest him simply
because he's a bloody immigrant.

347
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:58,008
He hasn't done anything wrong.

348
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:05,557
Stop it, damn you!

349
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:07,851
Never mind, Monsieur Gustave!
Let them proceed!

350
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:09,686
GUSTAVE H: Ow! That hurts!

351
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:15,317
You filthy, goddamn,
pock-marked, fascist assholes!

352
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:17,819
Take your hands
off my Lobby Boy!

353
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:31,041
What's the problem?

354
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,292
This is outrageous.

355
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:35,056
The young man works for me at the
Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad.

356
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:38,381
<i>Monsieur Gustave?</i>

357
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:43,220
My name is Henckels.

358
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:47,599
I'm the son of Dr. and Mrs. Wolfgang
Henckels-Bergersdörfer.

359
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:49,559
Do you remember me?

360
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,231
I know exactly who you are. It's uncanny.
You're little Albert.

361
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:56,233
I'm terribly embarrassed.
Release them.

362
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:59,236
Release them.

363
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:05,242
Hmm.

364
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:07,285
Your colleague is stateless.

365
00:22:07,536 --> 00:22:09,777
He'll need to apply for a
revised Special Transit Permit,

366
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:13,250
which at this point may be
very difficult to acquire.

367
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:14,417
Take this.

368
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:17,462
It's temporary

369
00:22:17,546 --> 00:22:18,964
but it's the best
I can offer, I'm afraid.

370
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:21,216
And how's your wonderful mother?

371
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:23,343
She's very well, thank you.
I adore her.

372
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:25,720
Send my love.
I will.

373
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:28,473
Your companion
was very kind to me

374
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:30,475
when I was a lonely little boy.

375
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,979
My men and I apologize
for disturbing you.

376
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:36,231
I beg your pardon, sir.

377
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:55,792
You see? There are still faint
glimmers of civilization

378
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:57,794
left in this barbaric
slaughterhouse

379
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,671
that was once known as humanity.

380
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:01,298
Indeed, that's what we provide

381
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:04,175
in our own modest,
humble, insignificant...

382
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:07,679
Oh, fuck it.

383
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:41,796
Where is she, Clotilde?
Take me to her.

384
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:19,376
You're looking so well, darling.
You really are.

385
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:20,919
They've done a marvelous job.

386
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:22,409
I don't know what sort of cream

387
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,546
they've put on you
down at the morgue,

388
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:25,048
but I want some.

389
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:27,509
Honestly, you look better
than you have in years.

390
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:29,719
You look like you're alive.

391
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:39,229
Oh, you changed it after all.
It's perfect.

392
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:41,231
Clotilde?
Oui, Monsieur Gustave?

393
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:43,441
A glass of chilled water
with no ice, please.

394
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:44,943
Yes. M. Gustave...

395
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:48,346
and. also. M. Serge would like to speak
with you privately in his office. please.

396
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:50,323
Oh.

397
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:52,409
All right, then.

398
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:54,619
I shan't be long, darling.

399
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:57,914
MR. MOUSTAFA: We were escorted
through a green baize door,

400
00:24:58,081 --> 00:25:01,459
<i>down a narrow service corridor
and into the butler's pantry.</i>

401
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:06,464
<i>A moment later,
the kitchen passage swung open</i>

402
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:09,926
<i>and a small servant dressed in
white jolted into the room.</i>

403
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,096
<i>I've never forgotten
the look on that man's face.</i>

404
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,932
What the devil is going on?

405
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:18,351
<i>I, myself,
had never set foot inside</i>

406
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:20,270
a <i>house of this kind in my life.</i>

407
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:24,232
<i>I understood very little about
the events that were to follow.</i>

408
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:27,402
<i>But, eventually,
I came to recognize,</i>

409
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:31,114
<i>when the destiny of a great
fortune is at stake,</i>

410
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:35,076
<i>men's greed spreads like a
poison in the bloodstream.</i>

411
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:40,582
<i>Uncles, nephews, cousins,</i>

412
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,418
<i>in-laws of increasingly
tenuous connection.</i>

413
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:45,128
<i>The old woman's
most distant relations</i>

414
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:47,464
<i>had come foraging
out of the woodwork.</i>

415
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,092
<i>At the head of
this congregation,</i>

416
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:53,261
<i>it was
a disorienting coincidence,</i>

417
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:56,181
<i>we discovered our
own Deputy Kovacs,</i>

418
00:25:56,431 --> 00:25:59,142
<i>himself an important attorney,
of course.</i>

419
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:02,687
<i>He was the executor
of the dead widow's estate.</i>

420
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:12,530
This is Madame D's
last will and testament.

421
00:26:13,823 --> 00:26:15,825
It consists of a general tontine

422
00:26:15,992 --> 00:26:19,871
drawn up before the event of her
husband's death 46 years ago,

423
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:23,291
in combination
with 635 amendments,

424
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,169
notations, corrections,
and letters of wishes

425
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:29,464
executed during
the subsequent decades.

426
00:26:31,716 --> 00:26:33,468
The ultimate legality
of this accumulation

427
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:34,844
requires further analysis,

428
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:38,056
but in the opinion of this office,
it was Madame D's intention

429
00:26:38,306 --> 00:26:40,183
that control of the
vast bulk of her estate

430
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:43,019
should be transferred,
forthwith, to her son, Dmitri,

431
00:26:43,228 --> 00:26:45,855
with special allowances
for his sisters,

432
00:26:46,064 --> 00:26:48,483
Marguerite, Laetizia,
and Carolina,

433
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:51,694
and minor gifts for various
members of the extended family

434
00:26:51,903 --> 00:26:53,613
as shown in
the List of Recipients,

435
00:26:53,738 --> 00:26:55,406
which I will elucidate
in due course.

436
00:26:57,742 --> 00:26:58,868
However.

437
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:03,706
An additional codicil,

438
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:07,210
delivered into my possession
by post only this morning,

439
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:09,754
and, by all indications,
sent by Madame D

440
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:11,325
during the last
hours of her life,

441
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:14,008
contains an amendment
to the original certificate,

442
00:27:14,217 --> 00:27:18,221
which, as prescribed by law,
I will read to you now.

443
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:19,668
The authenticity
of this document

444
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:21,883
has not yet been confirmed
by the presiding magistrate,

445
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:26,062
so I ask that all parties be
patient and refrain from comment

446
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:29,566
until such time as our
investigations can be completed.

447
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:41,744

00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:02,742
I can't believe it.
"...the younger..."

Can she do that?

00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,609
I'm afraid that's me, darling.

That fucking faggot!

463
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:19,949
He's a concierge.
What are you doing here?

464
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:23,119
I've come to pay my respects
to a great woman whom I loved.

465
00:28:23,286 --> 00:28:24,912
This man is an intruder
in my home!

466
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:26,581
It's not yours yet, Dmitri.

You're not getting Boy <i>with

469
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:35,298
How's that supposed
to make me feel?

470
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:37,508
Call the police.
We're pressing charges.

471
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:40,762
This criminal has plagued my
family for nearly 20 years.

472
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,930
He's a ruthless adventurer
and a con-artist

473
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:45,141
who preys on mentally feeble,
sick old ladies,

474
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,435
and he probably fucks them, too!

475
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:49,771
I go to bed with all my friends.

Where's Céline?

477
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:02,909
What?

00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:05,036
She's dead.
We're reading her will.

479
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:07,497
Oh, yes, yes, of course.

I'll out your throat!
You hear me?

483
00:29:14,337 --> 00:29:16,464
I thought I was supposed
to be a fucking faggot.

484
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:18,758
You are, but you're bisexual.

485
00:29:18,883 --> 00:29:20,134
Let's change the subject.

486
00:29:20,343 --> 00:29:21,386
I'm leaving.

487
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,269
Wait here quietly. please.

488
00:29:30,478 --> 00:29:33,690

Is it very beautiful?

492
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:39,862
Beyond description.

I don't see why not.

497
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:23,614
This is van Hoytl's
exquisite portrayal

498
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:26,075
of a beautiful boy
on the cusp of manhood.

499
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:28,911
Blond, smooth. Skin as
white as that milk.

500
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,455
Of impeccable provenance.

501
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:34,208
One of the last in private hands,
and unquestionably, the best.

502
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:35,710
It's a masterpiece.

503
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:37,962
The rest of this shit
is worthless junk.

00:31:32,016 --> 00:31:33,016
Yes. Serge.

Wrap up... "Boy With Apple"?

510
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:59,502
What did you want
to tell me, before?

511
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:02,838
I think I cannot say right now.

512
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:05,341
Write me tomorrow.
Lutzbahn Station!

513
00:32:17,311 --> 00:32:19,313
I'll never part with it.

514
00:32:19,522 --> 00:32:23,901
It reminded her of me. It will
remind me of her. Always.

515
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:26,821
I'll die with this
picture above my bed.

516
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:29,031
See the resemblance?

517
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:32,034
Oh, yes.

518
00:32:37,373 --> 00:32:39,083
Actually, we should sell it.

519
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:42,336
Sooner rather than later, in
case they try to steal it back.

520
00:32:42,545 --> 00:32:43,906
Plus, something about
those lunatic

521
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:45,256
foot-soldiers
on the express...

522
00:32:45,506 --> 00:32:48,884
This could be a tricky war and a
long dry spell in the hotel trade.

523
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:51,596
For all we know, they could
board us up tomorrow.

524
00:32:57,935 --> 00:32:59,895
Let's make
a solemn blood-pact.

525
00:33:00,104 --> 00:33:02,424
We'll contact the black market
and liquidate Boy <i>with</i> Apple

526
00:33:02,607 --> 00:33:03,608
by the end of the week,

527
00:33:03,691 --> 00:33:05,067
then leave the country
and lay low

528
00:33:05,234 --> 00:33:06,611
somewhere along
the Maltese Riviera

529
00:33:06,861 --> 00:33:09,363
until the troubles blow over
and we resume our posts.

530
00:33:09,572 --> 00:33:11,282
In exchange for
your help, your loyalty

531
00:33:11,532 --> 00:33:13,284
and your services
as my personal valet,

532
00:33:13,534 --> 00:33:18,039
I pledge to you 1.5%
of the net sale price.

533
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:20,249
1.5?
Plus room and board.

534
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:24,128
Could we make it 10?
10? Are you joking?

535
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:26,088
That's more than
I'd pay an actual dealer,

536
00:33:26,255 --> 00:33:28,591
and you wouldn't know Chiaroscuro
from chicken giblets.

537
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,479
No, 1.5 is correct.
But I'll tell you what,

538
00:33:30,718 --> 00:33:33,888
if I die first, and I most certainly
will, you will be my sole heir.

539
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:35,496
There's not much
in the kitty except

540
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:36,891
a set of ivory-backed
hairbrushes

541
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:38,434
and my library of
romantic poetry,

542
00:33:38,643 --> 00:33:41,270
but when the time comes,
these will be yours,

543
00:33:41,479 --> 00:33:44,774
along with whatever we haven't
already spent on whores and whiskey.

544
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,568
This is our sacred bond.

545
00:33:47,777 --> 00:33:49,779
I'll draw it up right now.

546
00:33:54,784 --> 00:33:58,829
I, Monsieur Gustave H, being of
relatively sound mind and body,

547
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,915
on this day,
the 19th of October,

548
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,917
in the year of our Lord 1932...

549
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:05,961
<i>MR. MOUSTAFA: He never told
me where he came from.</i>

550
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:11,676
<i>I never asked who
his family had been.</i>

551
00:34:32,613 --> 00:34:34,615
Excuse me.

552
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:36,283
Uh-huh?

553
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:40,830
The police are here.
They asked for you.

554
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:46,711
Tell them I'll be right down.

555
00:34:47,503 --> 00:34:49,505
Okay.

556
00:34:54,802 --> 00:34:56,722
Have you ever been questioned
by the authorities?

557
00:34:56,971 --> 00:34:58,332
Yes, on one occasion
I was arrested

558
00:34:58,347 --> 00:34:59,640
and tortured by
the rebel militia

559
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:00,891
after the Desert Uprising.

560
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:03,060
You know the drill, then.
Zip it. Of course.

561
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:06,689
You've never heard the word "van
Hoytl" in your life. Okay, let's go.

562
00:35:21,704 --> 00:35:23,706
How may we serve you, gentlemen?

563
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,167
Ah, Inspector Henckels.

564
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:28,919
"By order of the Commissioner
of Police, Zubrowka Province,

565
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:31,011
"I hereby place you under
arrest for the murder

566
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:33,549
"of Madame Céline Villeneuve
Desgoffe und Taxis."

567
00:35:33,716 --> 00:35:35,217
I knew there was
something fishy.

568
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:36,844
We never got the cause of death.

569
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:40,222
She's been murdered
and you think I did it.

570
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:43,893
HENCKELS: Hey!

571
00:35:45,728 --> 00:35:47,730
Stop!

572
00:36:36,904 --> 00:36:38,948
What happened?

573
00:36:39,156 --> 00:36:41,617
What happened, my dear Zero,
is I beat the living shit

574
00:36:41,784 --> 00:36:44,453
out of a sniveling little runt
called Pinky Bandinski

575
00:36:44,662 --> 00:36:46,455
who had the gall to
question my virility,

576
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:48,916
because if there's one thing we've
learned from penny dreadfuls,

577
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:51,285
it's that, when you find
yourself in a place like this,

578
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:52,795
you must never
be a candy-ass.

579
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:54,964
You've got to prove
yourself from Day One.

580
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,632
You've got to win their respect.

581
00:36:56,966 --> 00:37:00,094
You should take a long look
at his ugly mug this morning.

582
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,266
He's, actually,
become a dear friend.

583
00:37:05,474 --> 00:37:06,976
You'll meet him, I hope.

584
00:37:07,977 --> 00:37:10,020
So. You've talked to Kovacs?

585
00:37:10,271 --> 00:37:11,647
I saw him last night in secret.

586
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:14,136
He made me take an oath on a
Bible I wouldn't tell a soul.

587
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:15,359
You're supposed to also.

588
00:37:15,484 --> 00:37:16,652
I'll do that later.

589
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:17,987
He suspects you're innocent.

590
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:19,321
Of course he does.

591
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,282
What's the charge?

592
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,661
In the small hours of
the evening of 19 October,

593
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:28,914
an individual well-known to the house
and staff, a Monsieur Gustave H,

594
00:37:29,123 --> 00:37:32,251
did arrive at the Desgoffe
und Taxis residence in Lutz

595
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:34,962
and entered by
the rear service alley,

596
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,505
alerting no one to his presence,

597
00:37:36,714 --> 00:37:40,467
and did then proceed by way of
back stairs and servants' passage,

598
00:37:40,676 --> 00:37:43,012
to deliver himself into the
private chambers of Madame D.

599
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,764
There is no evidence
to indicate whether this visit

600
00:37:45,973 --> 00:37:48,434
had been pre-arranged
with her or not.

601
00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:53,522
The next morning Madame D was found
dead by strychnine poisoning.

602
00:37:53,731 --> 00:37:55,892
Monsieur Gustave was not
observed on the premises again

603
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:59,236
until, of course,
24 hours later.

604
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:01,697
The identity of
his accusers is made

605
00:38:01,864 --> 00:38:04,116
clear in this
notarized deposition.

606
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:07,745
They include, essentially, all
members of the extended family,

607
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:12,666
but the key witness who actually
ostensibly saw the alleged events

608
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:15,502
appears to have
fled the jurisdiction.

609
00:38:15,711 --> 00:38:17,379
His whereabouts are
currently unknown,

610
00:38:17,588 --> 00:38:20,215
but he's being sought and pursued
by the relevant authorities.

611
00:38:20,424 --> 00:38:22,509
Who is he?

612
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:27,640
Serge?

613
00:38:27,765 --> 00:38:28,766
I'm afraid so.

614
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:31,226
That little prick.

615
00:38:31,435 --> 00:38:33,562
No, I don't believe it.
They put him up to it.

616
00:38:33,771 --> 00:38:35,898
I've been dropped
into a nest of vipers.

617
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:37,107
You have an alibi?

618
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:39,485
Of course, but she's married
to the Duke of Westphalia.

619
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:42,334
I can't allow her name to get
mixed-up in all this monkey business.

620
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:44,365
Your life may be at stake.

621
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:46,325
I know, but the bitch legged it.

622
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:50,287
She's already on board the Queen
<i>Nasstasja</i> halfway to Dutch Tanganyika.

623
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,041
Don't give up.

624
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,600
<i>MR. MOUSTAFA:
The details of the conspiracy,</i>

625
00:39:02,758 --> 00:39:04,885
<i>now a matter of public record,</i>

626
00:39:05,094 --> 00:39:08,222
were, <i>at that time, impossible
for us to apprehend.</i>

627
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:27,116
I'm looking for Serge X,

628
00:39:27,324 --> 00:39:30,160
a young man in
the service of my employer,

629
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:33,872
the family Desgoffe und Taxis
of Schloss Lutz.

630
00:39:35,499 --> 00:39:37,084
Yes, sir?
You're his sister?

631
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,670
Yes, sir.
Seen him lately?

632
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:42,965
No, sir.
No, sir?

633
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:45,050
No, sir.

634
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:51,265
I need to find him right away,
for his own safety

635
00:39:51,473 --> 00:39:53,016
and everybody else's.

636
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:55,894
If he shows up...

637
00:39:56,103 --> 00:39:58,856
Yes, sir?
Tell him Jopling says,

638
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:01,316
"Come home."

639
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:06,071
<i>MR. MOUSTAFA:
But one thing was certain,</i>

640
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:11,702
<i>the Desgoffe und Taxis
were a very powerful family,</i>

641
00:40:15,831 --> 00:40:18,041
<i>and time was not on our side.</i>

642
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:28,844
A letter from
Monsieur Gustave. Zero.

643
00:40:29,762 --> 00:40:31,764
You want me to?
Read it.

644
00:40:37,603 --> 00:40:39,563
"My dear and
trusted colleagues..."

645
00:40:39,772 --> 00:40:41,815
I miss you deeply
as I write from the confines

646
00:40:42,024 --> 00:40:45,027
of my regrettable and
preposterous incarceration.

647
00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:47,321
Until I walk amongst
you again as a free man,

648
00:40:47,529 --> 00:40:49,907
the Grand Budapest
remains in your hands,

649
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:52,284
as does its
impeccable reputation.

650
00:40:52,493 --> 00:40:54,495
Keep it spotless and glorify it.

651
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:57,039
Take extra special care of
every little-bitty bit of it

652
00:40:57,247 --> 00:40:59,333
as if I were watching
over you like a hawk

653
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:03,003
with a horse whip in its
talons, because I am.

654
00:41:03,212 --> 00:41:06,256
Should I discover a lapse of
any variety during my absence,

655
00:41:06,465 --> 00:41:10,093
I promise, swift and merciless
justice will descend upon you.

656
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:14,264
A great and noble house has been
placed under your protection.

657
00:41:14,473 --> 00:41:17,100
Tell Zero if you see
any funny business.

658
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:19,436
"Your devoted
Monsieur Gustave."

659
00:41:19,645 --> 00:41:21,965
Then there's a poem, but we
might want to start on the soup

660
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:23,482
since it's 46 stanzas.

661
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:28,445
"A moist, black ash dampens the
filth of a dung-dark rat's nest

662
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:30,739
"and mingles with
the thick scent of wood rot

663
00:41:30,948 --> 00:41:32,741
"while the lark song
of a guttersnipe..."

664
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:35,202
JOPLING: I never
trusted that butler.

665
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,204
He's too honest.

666
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:39,081
DMITRI ON PHONE: Too honest, you <i>say?
</i> JOPLING: Mmm-hmm.

667
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:41,416
<i>Right, well, be that as it may,</i>

668
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,585
<i>find him quick
and make it snappy.</i>

669
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:02,479
May I offer any of you
inmates a plate of mush?

670
00:42:04,982 --> 00:42:06,400
No? Anyone?

671
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:08,861
You with the very
large scar on your face?

672
00:42:18,245 --> 00:42:21,123
Try it. It's actually quite warm
and nourishing this morning.

673
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:22,374
It needs a dash of salt.

674
00:42:31,258 --> 00:42:32,801
Good day.

675
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:39,641
Mush, gents?
Any takers?

676
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:45,314
Suit yourselves.

677
00:42:50,861 --> 00:42:52,529
Rise and shine.
Chop, chop.

678
00:42:54,114 --> 00:42:55,324
Good morning, Pinky.

679
00:43:01,121 --> 00:43:02,414
Mendl's again?

680
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:03,707
Precisely.

681
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:05,918
Who's got the throat slitter?

682
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:12,925
Out of this world.

683
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:14,426
GUSTAVE H:
Mendl's is the best.

684
00:43:14,635 --> 00:43:16,762
Well, back to work.
Monsieur Gustave?

685
00:43:20,349 --> 00:43:21,767
Yes?

686
00:43:25,562 --> 00:43:27,856
PINKY: Me and the boys
talked it over.

687
00:43:28,065 --> 00:43:30,525
We think you're
a really straight fellow.

688
00:43:30,734 --> 00:43:32,903
Well, I've never been
accused of that before,

689
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,072
but I appreciate the sentiment.

690
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,657
You're one of us now.

691
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:39,910
What a lovely thing to say.

692
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:41,995
Thank you, dear Pinky.
Thank you, Gunther.

693
00:43:42,204 --> 00:43:43,622
Thank you, Wolf.

694
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:45,832
Anything else?

695
00:43:47,668 --> 00:43:48,710
Tell him, Ludwig.

696
00:43:50,671 --> 00:43:53,966
Checkpoint 19 ain't
no two-bit hoosegow.

697
00:43:54,174 --> 00:43:57,427
You got broad-gauge iron bars
on every door, vent and window.

698
00:43:57,636 --> 00:44:01,223
You got 72 guards on the floor
and 16 more in the towers.

699
00:44:01,431 --> 00:44:05,727
You got a 325-foot drop into
a moat full of crocodiles.

700
00:44:05,936 --> 00:44:07,896
But, like the best of them,
it's got a soft spot,

701
00:44:08,105 --> 00:44:09,856
which in this case
happens to take the form

702
00:44:10,065 --> 00:44:12,192
of a storm-drain sewer system

703
00:44:12,401 --> 00:44:14,695
dating from the time of the
original rock fortification

704
00:44:14,903 --> 00:44:16,947
way back in the Middle Ages.

705
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:20,242
Now, nobody's saying it's a stroll
down a tree-lined promenade

706
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:22,202
with a fine lady
and a white poodle,

707
00:44:22,411 --> 00:44:26,039
but it's got what
you'd call "vulnerability,"

708
00:44:26,248 --> 00:44:28,917
and that's our bread and butter.

709
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:31,920
Take a look.

710
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:34,464
Who drew this?

711
00:44:34,673 --> 00:44:36,758
What do you mean,
"Who drew this?" I did.

712
00:44:36,967 --> 00:44:39,052
Very good. You've got
a wonderful line, Ludwig.

713
00:44:39,261 --> 00:44:40,929
This <i>shows</i> great
artistic promise.

714
00:44:41,138 --> 00:44:44,516
Question, how do you intend to
penetrate this lowest rudiment?

715
00:44:44,725 --> 00:44:47,269
It's 25 inches of reinforced
granite masonry, is it not?

716
00:44:47,477 --> 00:44:49,187
Digging with
the throat-slitter,

717
00:44:49,396 --> 00:44:52,024
I expect this would take three to
six months of continual effort,

718
00:44:52,232 --> 00:44:53,793
during which time
several of our members

719
00:44:53,942 --> 00:44:55,360
will have been
violently executed.

720
00:44:55,569 --> 00:44:57,904
You hit the nail on the head,
Mr. Gustave.

721
00:44:58,113 --> 00:45:00,699
We got fake documents,
second-hand street clothes,

722
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:03,285
a rope ladder made of
sticks and bunk-linens,

723
00:45:03,493 --> 00:45:05,370
but we need digging tools,

724
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:08,540
which are proving hard to
come by in this flop-house.

725
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:24,530
<i>YOUNG</i> WRITER:
<i>At this point in the story,</i>

726
00:45:24,681 --> 00:45:28,268
<i>the old man fell silent and
pushed away his saddle of lamb.</i>

727
00:45:28,477 --> 00:45:31,313
<i>His eyes went
blank as two stones.</i>

728
00:45:31,521 --> 00:45:33,523
<i>I could see he was in distress.</i>

729
00:45:33,732 --> 00:45:34,941
Are you ill,
Mr. Moustafa?

730
00:45:35,067 --> 00:45:36,276
<i>I finally asked.</i>

731
00:45:36,485 --> 00:45:37,569
Oh, dear me, no.

732
00:45:37,694 --> 00:45:38,779
<i>He said.</i>

733
00:45:38,987 --> 00:45:41,406
It's only that I don't
know how to proceed.

734
00:45:42,616 --> 00:45:44,785
<i>He was crying.</i>

735
00:45:44,993 --> 00:45:46,495
You see,
I never speak of Agatha,

736
00:45:46,703 --> 00:45:50,290
because even at
the thought of her name

737
00:45:50,499 --> 00:45:53,251
I'm unable to
control my emotions.

738
00:45:56,338 --> 00:45:58,590
Well, I suppose
there's no way around it.

739
00:45:59,883 --> 00:46:02,219
You see, she saved us.

740
00:46:02,511 --> 00:46:04,346
<i>On our third formal rendezvous,</i>

741
00:46:04,554 --> 00:46:07,474
<i>I had asked for her hand in
marriage and she had agreed.</i>

742
00:46:07,557 --> 00:46:09,559
Will you marry me?
Yes.

743
00:46:11,353 --> 00:46:14,231
<i>We did not have 50 Klubecks
between the two of us.</i>

744
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:17,692
<i>No one knew, of course, but,
then, who would have cared?</i>

745
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:20,654
<i>We were each completely
on our own in the world,</i>

746
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,782
<i>and we were deeply in love.</i>

747
00:46:32,582 --> 00:46:34,417
Here.
Thank you.

748
00:46:34,626 --> 00:46:36,461
It's a book.
I see.

749
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:38,171
<i>Romantic Poetry, Volume One.</i>

750
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:39,620
Monsieur Gustave recommended it.

751
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:40,911
I have a copy of my own as well.

752
00:46:40,924 --> 00:46:42,884
I ruined the surprise,
I suppose.

753
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:44,970
I'll go ahead
and open it, anyway.

754
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:50,433
Read the inscription.

755
00:47:08,952 --> 00:47:10,036
<i>MR. MOUSTAFA:
Monsieur Gustave insisted</i>

756
00:47:10,245 --> 00:47:12,497
<i>on an immediate and thorough
cross-examination...</i>

757
00:47:12,706 --> 00:47:14,374
She's charming.
She's so charming.

758
00:47:15,584 --> 00:47:18,003
<i>During which he presented
Agatha with a porcelain pendant</i>

759
00:47:18,211 --> 00:47:21,131
<i>and five dozen individually
tissue-wrapped white tulips</i>

760
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:23,466
<i>in a box the size
of a child's coffin.</i>

761
00:47:23,675 --> 00:47:24,968
It's not right.

762
00:47:25,093 --> 00:47:26,386
I beg your pardon?

763
00:47:26,595 --> 00:47:27,762
Why is he sulking?

764
00:47:27,971 --> 00:47:29,971
She's my girlfriend.
You can't just buy her things.

765
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:33,393
I'm only interviewing this vision
of loveliness on your behalf.

766
00:47:33,602 --> 00:47:36,188
Never be jealous in this life,
Zero, not even for an instant.

767
00:47:36,396 --> 00:47:37,939
Is he flirting with you?

768
00:47:39,232 --> 00:47:40,734
Yes.

769
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:42,360
I approve of this union.

770
00:47:42,569 --> 00:47:45,071
Agatha, my beauty,
return to your beloved.

771
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,573
MR. MOUSTAFA:
Soon we learned...

772
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:48,491
GUSTAVE H:
Blessings upon you both.

773
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,410
<i>Not only was Agatha
immensely skilled</i>

774
00:47:50,619 --> 00:47:53,121
<i>with a palette knife and
a butter-cream flourish...</i>

775
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:55,332
Mendl.
Go.

776
00:47:56,499 --> 00:47:58,501
<i>She was also very brave.</i>

777
00:48:02,964 --> 00:48:05,050
<i>I believe she was born that way.</i>

778
00:48:24,444 --> 00:48:26,488
Something's missing.

779
00:48:26,696 --> 00:48:31,159
A crucial document, either misplaced
or, conceivably, destroyed.

780
00:48:31,368 --> 00:48:33,870
I don't know what it contains, I
don't know what it represents,

781
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:35,455
I don't know what it is,

782
00:48:35,664 --> 00:48:38,750
but there are traces
and shadows of it everywhere.

783
00:48:38,959 --> 00:48:40,669
Now, I don't want to alarm you,

784
00:48:40,877 --> 00:48:42,757
and I don't expect to see
any significant change

785
00:48:42,796 --> 00:48:44,236
in the magistrate's
ultimate decision

786
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:45,799
vis-à-vis your
own inheritance,

787
00:48:46,007 --> 00:48:49,803
but, especially given the
circumstances of the death,

788
00:48:50,011 --> 00:48:52,180
as well as the disappearance
of the key witness

789
00:48:52,347 --> 00:48:54,474
in the murder case, Serge X,

790
00:48:54,683 --> 00:48:56,524
I suggest that we immediately
bring this matter

791
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,770
to the attention of
the municipal inspector

792
00:48:58,979 --> 00:49:00,730
so that there can be
absolutely no question

793
00:49:00,939 --> 00:49:03,316
of impropriety
at any future date.

794
00:49:03,525 --> 00:49:05,277
Agreed?
Not agreed.

795
00:49:07,112 --> 00:49:09,197
Not agreed?
Not agreed.

796
00:49:11,908 --> 00:49:13,493
Can I ask you a question,
Vilmos?

797
00:49:13,618 --> 00:49:15,161
Yes, Dmitri?

798
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:16,663
Who are you working for?

799
00:49:16,788 --> 00:49:18,039
I beg your pardon?

800
00:49:18,248 --> 00:49:20,041
Who are you working for?

801
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:22,002
I thought you're supposed
to be our lawyer.

802
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:23,670
Well, in point of fact,

803
00:49:23,753 --> 00:49:25,588
I'm the executor of the estate.

804
00:49:25,797 --> 00:49:29,926
In this particular situation,
I represent the deceased.

805
00:49:30,135 --> 00:49:31,136
Oh, yeah?

806
00:49:31,261 --> 00:49:34,014
Yeah. A provision for my fees
was included in the...

807
00:49:34,222 --> 00:49:39,019
Just wrap it up and
don't make waves. Agreed?

808
00:49:41,021 --> 00:49:42,981
I'm an attorney.
I'm obligated to

809
00:49:43,106 --> 00:49:45,066
proceed according
to the rule of law.

810
00:49:46,443 --> 00:49:47,569
Not agreed.

811
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:56,202
This stinks, sisters.

812
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:01,708
Did he just throw
my cat out the window?

813
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:04,794
I don't think so.

814
00:50:04,878 --> 00:50:05,879
No. Did he?
Jopling?

815
00:50:18,266 --> 00:50:19,768
Shh-shh.

816
00:50:32,864 --> 00:50:34,866
LUDWIG: Okay.

817
00:50:45,418 --> 00:50:48,171
There's something
I haven't told you, Agatha.

818
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:49,589
Okay.
We stole a painting.

819
00:50:49,798 --> 00:50:52,342
It's very valuable, maybe five
million Klubecks, in fact.

820
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,427
I don't know if anyone's
even noticed it's missing yet,

821
00:50:54,636 --> 00:50:56,221
but if something
should happen to me...

822
00:50:56,429 --> 00:50:57,931
You steal art?

823
00:50:59,015 --> 00:51:02,060
One picture. Anyway, we need to
make a plan for your survival.

824
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:05,148
Hide this. It's in code and you might
need a magnifying glass to read it,

825
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:07,711
but it tells you exactly where
and how to find Boy <i>with</i> Apple.

826
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:09,776
Don't take less than half the
retail asking price. Also...

827
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:11,277
Zero, I'm a baker.

828
00:51:11,403 --> 00:51:12,695
You're a pastry chef.

829
00:51:12,904 --> 00:51:14,781
I'm not a fence,
if that's the term.

830
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:16,866
I don't trade in
stolen property.

831
00:51:18,118 --> 00:51:19,953
I said it wrong.
She willed it to him.

832
00:51:29,337 --> 00:51:31,339
Go to sleep.

833
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:33,842
<i>Yes, Herr Mendl.</i>

834
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:38,346
Hide this.
No.

835
00:51:38,555 --> 00:51:40,557
Okay, but take it anyway.

836
00:55:06,554 --> 00:55:09,766
<i>MR. MOUSTAFA: The next morning,
Herr Becker received</i> a <i>peculiar,</i>

837
00:55:09,974 --> 00:55:12,685
<i>last-minute notice from the
office of Deputy Kovacs,</i>

838
00:55:12,894 --> 00:55:17,357
<i>postponing their scheduled
meeting, in perpetuity.</i>

839
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:49,472
LUDWIG: Let's blow.

840
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:00,501
How did you get out there?

841
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:01,878
Shut the fuck up.

842
00:57:02,086 --> 00:57:04,714
These guys are trying to escape.

843
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:06,632
What's wrong with you,
you goddamn snitch?

844
00:57:06,841 --> 00:57:08,843
Guard! Guard!

845
00:57:16,142 --> 00:57:17,393
It's you.
Thank you.

846
00:57:17,477 --> 00:57:19,604
Thank you, you sweet, kind man.

847
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:51,469
LUDWIG: Okay.

848
00:58:43,521 --> 00:58:44,855
ALL: Whoa!

849
00:59:05,501 --> 00:59:08,129
I suppose you'd
call that a draw.

850
00:59:17,263 --> 00:59:19,265
Good evening.

851
00:59:27,523 --> 00:59:31,152
Let me introduce you. Pinky, Wolf,
Ludwig, this is the divine Zero.

852
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:33,195
Gunther was slain
in the catacombs.

853
00:59:33,446 --> 00:59:36,198
Well, boys, who knows when we'll
all meet again, but if one clay...

854
00:59:36,449 --> 00:59:37,491
Hold it.

855
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:42,872
No time to gab.

856
00:59:43,122 --> 00:59:45,499
Take care of yourself,
Mr. Gustave.

857
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:47,668
Good luck, kid.

858
00:59:51,297 --> 00:59:52,798
Which way to the safe house?

859
00:59:52,923 --> 00:59:54,383
I couldn't find one.

860
00:59:54,508 --> 00:59:57,553
No safe house? Really? We're
completely on our own out here?

861
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:00,890
I'm afraid so. I asked around, but...

862
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:04,060
GUSTAVE H: I understand. Too risky.
We'll just have to wing it, I suppose.

863
01:00:04,143 --> 01:00:06,520
Let's put on our disguises.

864
01:00:06,687 --> 01:00:07,730
We're wearing them.

865
01:00:07,855 --> 01:00:08,856
No, we're not.

866
01:00:09,065 --> 01:00:11,525
We said false whiskers
and fake noses and so on.

867
01:00:11,692 --> 01:00:12,860
You didn't bring any?

868
01:00:13,027 --> 01:00:14,267
I thought you were growing one.

869
01:00:14,403 --> 01:00:17,323
And it wouldn't look
realistic, would it?

870
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:19,700
No, when done properly,
they're perfectly convincing.

871
01:00:19,909 --> 01:00:21,869
But I take your point.
So be it.

872
01:00:22,036 --> 01:00:24,497
Give me a few squirts of L'air
de Panache, please, will you?

873
01:00:26,207 --> 01:00:27,833
Can I not get a squirt, even?

874
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:29,543
I forgot the L'air de Panache.

875
01:00:29,752 --> 01:00:32,338
Honestly, you forgot
the L'air de Panache?

876
01:00:32,546 --> 01:00:35,508
I don't believe it.
How could you?

877
01:00:35,716 --> 01:00:38,678
I've been in jail, Zero! Do you
understand how humiliating this is?

878
01:00:38,886 --> 01:00:40,888
I smell.

879
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:44,767
That's just marvelous, isn't it?

880
01:00:45,017 --> 01:00:47,228
I suppose this is to
be expected back in...

881
01:00:47,311 --> 01:00:48,729
Where do you come from again?

882
01:00:48,938 --> 01:00:50,439
Aq Salim al-Jabat.
Precisely.

883
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:53,234
I suppose this is to be expected
back in Aq Salim al-Jabat

884
01:00:53,401 --> 01:00:54,694
where one's prized possessions

885
01:00:54,902 --> 01:00:56,862
are a stack of filthy carpets
and a starving goat,

886
01:00:56,946 --> 01:01:00,741
and one sleeps behind a tent flap and
survives on wild dates and scarabs.

887
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:03,452
But it's not how I trained you.

888
01:01:03,703 --> 01:01:05,343
What on God's earth
possessed you to leave

889
01:01:05,413 --> 01:01:06,747
the homeland where
you obviously belong

890
01:01:06,914 --> 01:01:08,290
and travel unspeakable distances

891
01:01:08,416 --> 01:01:11,961
to become a penniless immigrant in a
refined, highly-cultivated society

892
01:01:12,211 --> 01:01:15,214
that, quite frankly, could've gotten
along very well without you?

893
01:01:16,132 --> 01:01:17,133
The war.

894
01:01:18,259 --> 01:01:19,593
Say again?

895
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,804
Well, you see,
my father was murdered

896
01:01:22,054 --> 01:01:24,640
and the rest of my family
were executed by firing squad.

897
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:26,308
Our village was
burned to the ground

898
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:29,770
and those who managed to
survive were forced to flee.

899
01:01:29,937 --> 01:01:31,772
I left because of the war.

900
01:01:32,732 --> 01:01:36,444
I see. So you're, actually, really
more of a refugee, in that sense?

901
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:38,612
Truly.

902
01:01:38,779 --> 01:01:42,491
Well, I suppose I'd better take
back everything I just said.

903
01:01:43,743 --> 01:01:46,829
What a bloody idiot I am.
Pathetic fool.

904
01:01:47,079 --> 01:01:49,165
Goddamn, selfish bastard.

905
01:01:49,415 --> 01:01:52,460
This is disgraceful, and it's beneath
the standards of the Grand Budapest.

906
01:01:54,128 --> 01:01:56,172
I apologize on
behalf of the hotel.

907
01:01:56,422 --> 01:01:58,862
It's not your fault. You were
just upset I forgot the perfume.

908
01:01:58,966 --> 01:02:02,970
Don't make excuses for me.
I owe you my life.

909
01:02:03,179 --> 01:02:07,016
You are my dear friend and protégé
and I'm very proud of you.

910
01:02:07,266 --> 01:02:09,518
You must know that.

911
01:02:09,769 --> 01:02:11,771
I'm so sorry, Zero.

912
01:02:13,314 --> 01:02:15,316
We're brothers.

913
01:02:23,491 --> 01:02:25,493
How's our darling Agatha?

914
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:31,207
"'Twas first light when I saw
her face upon the heath,

915
01:02:31,457 --> 01:02:34,043
"and hence did I return,
day-by-day, entranced,

916
01:02:34,293 --> 01:02:37,171
"tho' vinegar did brine my
heart, never..."

917
01:02:37,338 --> 01:02:40,059
Very good. I'm going to stop you
there because the alarm has sounded,

918
01:02:40,216 --> 01:02:43,677
but remember where we left off
because I insist you finish later.

919
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:04,448
I want roadblocks
at every junction for 50km.

920
01:03:04,657 --> 01:03:07,368
I want rail blocks at every
train station for 100km.

921
01:03:07,618 --> 01:03:09,203
I want 50 men and 10 bloodhounds

922
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:10,454
ready in five minutes.

923
01:03:10,663 --> 01:03:12,206
We're going
to strip-search

924
01:03:12,331 --> 01:03:14,011
every pretzel-Ha us,
Waffel-hut, Biergarten

925
01:03:14,041 --> 01:03:16,126
and especially every grand hotel

926
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:17,837
from Äugenzburg to Zilchbrück.

927
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:20,047
These men are dangerous,
professional criminals.

928
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:22,341
At least three of
them are anyway.

929
01:03:22,550 --> 01:03:23,551
Who are you?

930
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:26,971
What are you doing here?

931
01:03:27,054 --> 01:03:28,722
Civilian personnel aren't
permitted in the cellblock.

932
01:03:28,806 --> 01:03:30,307
This is a military
investigation.

933
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:31,934
This is Mr. Jopling, sir.

934
01:03:32,017 --> 01:03:34,228
His employer's mother
was one of the victims...

935
01:03:34,395 --> 01:03:36,730
Shut up.

936
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:40,067
You work for the family
Desgoffe und Taxis?

937
01:03:40,234 --> 01:03:44,196
Are you aware of the murder of Deputy
Vilmos Kovacs on 23rd October?

938
01:03:44,405 --> 01:03:46,740
I'm aware of his disappearance.

939
01:03:46,991 --> 01:03:49,551
His body was found stuffed in a
sarcophagus behind a storage room

940
01:03:49,702 --> 01:03:51,245
at the Kunstmuseum
late last night.

941
01:03:51,495 --> 01:03:54,081
<i>He was short four fingers.</i>

942
01:03:54,248 --> 01:03:55,541
What do you know about that?

943
01:03:55,666 --> 01:03:56,917
Nothing.

944
01:03:58,586 --> 01:04:00,588
Escort Mr. Jopling
off the premises.

945
01:04:11,098 --> 01:04:13,100
Mendl's.

946
01:04:17,897 --> 01:04:20,107
Operator, get me the Excelsior
Palace in Baden-Jurgen

947
01:04:20,274 --> 01:04:21,775
and reverse the charges, please.

948
01:04:22,026 --> 01:04:23,861
We've no choice. There's
nowhere else to turn.

949
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:25,362
I'll hold.
Thank you.

950
01:04:25,571 --> 01:04:28,282
It's our only hope. Otherwise, I shouldn't
even mention its existence to you.

951
01:04:28,449 --> 01:04:31,329
It goes without saying, never breathe
a word about this to a living soul.

952
01:04:31,452 --> 01:04:33,212
Do you swear? Of course.
What is it, in fact?

953
01:04:33,412 --> 01:04:34,538
I can't say.

954
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:38,959
How does one come by
front-row aisle seats

955
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:42,463
for a first night at the Opera
Toscana with one day's notice?

956
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:44,131
How does one arrange
a private viewing

957
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:47,134
of the tapestry collection
at the Royal Saxon Gallery?

958
01:04:47,301 --> 01:04:51,472
How does one secure a corner table
at Chez Dominique on a Thursday?

959
01:04:51,639 --> 01:04:53,933
Ivan, darling,
it's Gustave. Hello.

960
01:04:54,141 --> 01:04:56,143
Well, I was until
about five minutes ago.

961
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:59,480
We've taken it upon ourselves to clear
out in a hurry if you see what I mean.

962
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:02,149
Well, through a sewer,
as it happens. Exactly.

963
01:05:02,316 --> 01:05:05,037
Listen, Ivan, I'm sorry to out you
off, but we're in a bit of a bind.

964
01:05:05,152 --> 01:05:06,820
This is an official request.

965
01:05:06,987 --> 01:05:10,157
I'm formally calling upon
the special services of...

966
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:16,830
IVAN: <i>I'll call you back,
Gustave.</i>

967
01:05:17,081 --> 01:05:18,999
Right. Stand by.

968
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:22,419
I beg your pardon.
Do you prefer to walk?

969
01:05:22,628 --> 01:05:24,505
We're right here.
It's very simple.

970
01:05:24,755 --> 01:05:26,757
Straight down the corniche,
then left.

971
01:05:26,966 --> 01:05:28,968
Jojo, see the gentleman out.

972
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:34,139
Get me Monsieur Georges
at the Château Luxe, please.

973
01:05:35,933 --> 01:05:38,310
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

974
01:05:39,603 --> 01:05:40,604
Take over.

975
01:05:40,688 --> 01:05:42,106
<i>Happy birthday, dear...</i>

976
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:43,524
GEORGES: Hello, Ivan?

977
01:05:45,693 --> 01:05:47,528
Got it.

978
01:05:47,778 --> 01:05:50,531
Get me Monsieur Dino at the
Palazzo Principessa, please.

979
01:05:52,282 --> 01:05:54,618
Higher, goddammit, higher!

980
01:05:56,537 --> 01:05:58,205
Take over.

981
01:05:58,372 --> 01:05:59,957
DINO: Monsieur Georges.
Higher.

982
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:02,334
I see. Straightaway.

983
01:06:03,877 --> 01:06:06,380
Get me Monsieur Robin at
I'Hôtel Côte du Cap, please.

984
01:06:08,132 --> 01:06:10,009
And two and three.

985
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:14,138
Monsieur Robin. There's a call
from Monsieur Dino for you.

986
01:06:14,346 --> 01:06:16,348
Take over.

987
01:06:17,725 --> 01:06:19,059
One, two, three.

988
01:06:19,184 --> 01:06:20,477
<i>ROBIN: Yes, Dino.</i>

989
01:06:20,686 --> 01:06:23,981
Yes, Dino. Okay, Dino.

990
01:06:25,733 --> 01:06:28,318
Get me Monsieur Martin
at the Ritz Imperial, please.

991
01:06:30,029 --> 01:06:31,905
Too much salt.

992
01:06:32,072 --> 01:06:33,615
Not enough pepper-

993
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,202
Take over.

994
01:06:39,246 --> 01:06:41,331
<i>Robin? Martin.
Too much salt.</i>

995
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:43,542
So I've heard.

996
01:06:44,877 --> 01:06:47,838
Maybe.
Let me make a few calls.

997
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:55,429
Serge X, missing.
Deputy Kovacs, also missing.

998
01:06:55,596 --> 01:06:58,432
Madame D, dead. Boy <i>with
</i> Apple, stolen, by us.

999
01:06:58,599 --> 01:07:01,060
Dmitri and Jopling, ruthless,
cold-blooded savages.

1000
01:07:01,268 --> 01:07:04,521
Gustave H, at large.
What else?

1001
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:06,023
Zero, confused.

1002
01:07:06,148 --> 01:07:07,441
Zero, confused, indeed.

1003
01:07:07,608 --> 01:07:09,777
The plot "thickens,"
as they say.

1004
01:07:10,027 --> 01:07:12,613
Why, by the way?
Is it a soup metaphor?

1005
01:07:12,863 --> 01:07:14,865
I don't know.

1006
01:07:19,703 --> 01:07:21,288
Get in.

1007
01:07:23,749 --> 01:07:25,042
IVAN: We found the butler.

1008
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:28,045
He's hiding out in the remote
foothills near Gabelmeister's Peak.

1009
01:07:28,253 --> 01:07:30,380
Our contact convinced him
to meet you midday tomorrow

1010
01:07:30,589 --> 01:07:31,965
at the observatory
on the summit.

1011
01:07:32,132 --> 01:07:34,468
Tell no one.
He'll explain everything.

1012
01:07:34,718 --> 01:07:36,762
Your train departs
in four and a half minutes.

1013
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:38,388
Here's your tickets.

1014
01:07:38,597 --> 01:07:39,640
Third class?

1015
01:07:39,807 --> 01:07:40,808
It was overbooked

1016
01:07:41,058 --> 01:07:44,645
but the conductor used to be a
sommelier at the old Versailles.

1017
01:07:44,812 --> 01:07:45,979
He pulled some strings.

1018
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:48,273
You'll need these
for the dining car.

1019
01:07:51,151 --> 01:07:53,153
One last thing.

1020
01:07:54,822 --> 01:07:56,824
L'air de Panache.

1021
01:07:59,326 --> 01:08:01,495
They only had
the half-ounce.

1022
01:08:05,791 --> 01:08:07,793
We should give him something
as a symbolic gesture.

1023
01:08:08,001 --> 01:08:10,254
How much money you got? 42
Klubecks and 3 postage stamps.

1024
01:08:10,462 --> 01:08:12,464
Give me 25. Yes.

1025
01:08:16,176 --> 01:08:17,553
Bless you.

1026
01:08:17,678 --> 01:08:19,096
Please.

1027
01:08:35,487 --> 01:08:36,572
JOPLING: I've got
to hand it to him.

1028
01:08:36,655 --> 01:08:37,815
DMITRI ON PHONE:
<i>Jesus</i> Christ.

1029
01:08:37,823 --> 01:08:41,577
JOPLING: I didn't see that coming.
Well, what do you want next?

1030
01:08:41,702 --> 01:08:47,040
DMITRI: <i>Talk to the club-footed sister
again, and, this time, be persuasive.</i>

1031
01:08:54,173 --> 01:08:56,967
DMITRI: Goddamn
son of a bitch.

1032
01:09:20,532 --> 01:09:22,534
Holy fuck!

1033
01:09:26,872 --> 01:09:29,750
What's the meaning of this shit?

1034
01:09:29,917 --> 01:09:31,557
Boy <i>with Apple?</i>
I thought you'd hidden it.

1035
01:09:31,627 --> 01:09:34,087
Why are you only noticing now? I
assumed it went to the tax appraiser.

1036
01:09:34,338 --> 01:09:36,006
Are you fucking kidding me?

1037
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:38,091
<i>CLOTILDE: Excusez-moi.</i>

1038
01:09:38,592 --> 01:09:41,386
I believe it was removed
by Monsieur Gustave.

1039
01:09:49,269 --> 01:09:50,395
I'm not angry with Serge.

1040
01:09:50,604 --> 01:09:53,065
You can't blame someone for their
basic lack of moral fiber.

1041
01:09:53,273 --> 01:09:55,234
He's a frightened, little,
yellow-bellied coward.

1042
01:09:55,442 --> 01:09:57,482
It's not his fault, is it?
I don't know. It depends.

1043
01:09:57,694 --> 01:09:59,238
Well, you can say that
about most anything.

1044
01:09:59,321 --> 01:10:00,739
"It depends."
Of course it depends.

1045
01:10:00,948 --> 01:10:02,628
Of course it depends.
Of course it depends.

1046
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,785
Yes, I suppose you're right.
Of course it depends.

1047
01:10:05,035 --> 01:10:08,455
That doesn't mean I'm not going
to throttle the little swamp rat.

1048
01:10:10,958 --> 01:10:15,254
May I officiate, by the way?
The ceremony?

1049
01:10:15,462 --> 01:10:16,463
With pleasure.

1050
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:19,258
I must say, I find that
girl utterly delightful.

1051
01:10:19,466 --> 01:10:20,968
Flat as a board,
enormous birthmark

1052
01:10:21,218 --> 01:10:22,970
the shape of Mexico
over half her face,

1053
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:25,305
sweating for hours on end
in that sweltering kitchen

1054
01:10:25,472 --> 01:10:26,890
while Mendl,
genius though he is,

1055
01:10:27,099 --> 01:10:28,642
looms over her like
a hulking gorilla.

1056
01:10:28,892 --> 01:10:31,061
Yet without question,
without fail,

1057
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:34,481
always and invariably,
she's exceedingly lovely.

1058
01:10:34,648 --> 01:10:35,983
Why?

1059
01:10:36,233 --> 01:10:38,819
Because of her purity.

1060
01:10:40,904 --> 01:10:43,156
She admires you as well,
Monsieur Gustave.

1061
01:10:43,323 --> 01:10:44,658
Does she?

1062
01:10:44,783 --> 01:10:46,076
Very much.

1063
01:10:46,285 --> 01:10:50,080
That's a good sign, you know.
It means she "gets it."

1064
01:10:50,289 --> 01:10:52,291
That's important.

1065
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:56,753
Don't flirt with her.

1066
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:46,053
LIEUTENANT: A radio telegram was delivered
and signed for by the girl at 4:00 AM.

1067
01:11:46,219 --> 01:11:48,900
The envelope was found near the body,
but its contents were missing.

1068
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:50,974
However, the telegraph
office always keeps

1069
01:11:51,058 --> 01:11:52,809
a carbon of the ticker tape
for 24 hours.

1070
01:11:53,018 --> 01:11:55,228
I copied it down.
It reads as follows,

1071
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:57,397
"Pack your things stop.

1072
01:11:57,647 --> 01:11:59,733
"Be ready to leave
at moment's notice stop.

1073
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:02,361
"Hide-out is vicinity
of Gabelmeister's Peak stop.

1074
01:12:02,569 --> 01:12:04,988
"Destroy this message
all my love full stop."

1075
01:12:06,073 --> 01:12:07,866
Where's the basket?

1076
01:12:33,183 --> 01:12:35,185
PUMP ATTENDANT:
Where you headed, mister?

1077
01:12:38,897 --> 01:12:41,233
Skiing? Sledding?
Mountain climbing?

1078
01:12:50,951 --> 01:12:52,911
Three Klubecks.

1079
01:13:03,046 --> 01:13:04,966
<i>MR. MOUSTAFA: By express
wireless, I wrote Agatha</i>

1080
01:13:05,048 --> 01:13:07,801
<i>with instructions to move
to our pre-arranged hideout,</i>

1081
01:13:07,968 --> 01:13:10,470
<i>a Gypsy caravan
on the outer Nebelsbad road,</i>

1082
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,472
<i>while Monsieur Gustave
and I continued east</i>

1083
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:14,099
<i>into the Zubrowkian Alps,</i>

1084
01:13:14,307 --> 01:13:18,061
<i>toward our high-altitude rendezvous

1085
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:22,274
<i>As a precaution,
we disembarked quietly</i>

1086
01:13:22,482 --> 01:13:24,901
<i>in the freight yard
just outside the station.</i>

1087
01:13:32,492 --> 01:13:34,327
L'air de Panache.

1088
01:13:44,963 --> 01:13:47,443
It's a hell of a view. I give
them that, for what's it's worth.

1089
01:13:47,465 --> 01:13:49,467
I agree.

1090
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:03,982
"'Tis oft'-remarked, no single,
falling-flake does any other

1091
01:14:04,232 --> 01:14:07,819
"in its pure and perfect
form..." Somebody's coming.

1092
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:13,533
Are you Monsieur Gustave of the
Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad?

1093
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:14,993
Uh-huh.

1094
01:14:15,118 --> 01:14:16,369
Get on the next cable car.

1095
01:14:55,909 --> 01:14:59,329
Are you Monsieur Gustave of the
Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad?

1096
01:14:59,537 --> 01:15:00,538
Uh-huh.

1097
01:15:00,664 --> 01:15:01,665
Switch with me.

1098
01:15:31,236 --> 01:15:33,947
Are you Monsieur Gustave of the
Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad?

1099
01:15:34,197 --> 01:15:35,532
Uh-huh.

1100
01:15:35,657 --> 01:15:36,950
Put these on and sing.

1101
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:03,935
MONK: Psst.

1102
01:16:05,103 --> 01:16:06,271
Are you Monsieur
Gustave of the...

1103
01:16:06,396 --> 01:16:07,564
Yes, dammit.

1104
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:08,773
Confess.

1105
01:16:08,982 --> 01:16:10,775
I'm innocent.

1106
01:16:10,984 --> 01:16:12,819
Hmm? No, no.

1107
01:16:22,328 --> 01:16:24,998
Forgive me, Monsieur Gustave.
I never meant to betray you.

1108
01:16:25,165 --> 01:16:26,583
They threatened my life and now

1109
01:16:26,708 --> 01:16:28,126
they've murdered my only family.

1110
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:29,919
No. Who did they
kill this time?

1111
01:16:30,128 --> 01:16:31,254
My dear sister.

1112
01:16:31,379 --> 01:16:32,505
The girl with the club foot?

1113
01:16:32,672 --> 01:16:34,090
Yes.
Those fuckers!

1114
01:16:34,299 --> 01:16:35,739
I tried to warn you
at the beginning.

1115
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:37,343
I know, darling.
Let's put that behind us.

1116
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:39,012
Listen, I hate to
put you on the spot,

1117
01:16:39,137 --> 01:16:40,597
but I really must ask
you to clear my name.

1118
01:16:40,805 --> 01:16:43,850
Obviously you're grieving...
There's more.

1119
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,435
To the story.
I get it. Go on.

1120
01:16:45,643 --> 01:16:47,645
I was the official witness
in Madame D's presence

1121
01:16:47,854 --> 01:16:49,439
to the creation of a second will

1122
01:16:49,647 --> 01:16:52,692
to be executed only in the
event of her death by murder.

1123
01:16:52,859 --> 01:16:54,360
A second will?
Right.

1124
01:16:54,611 --> 01:16:56,154
In case she got bumped off?
Right.

1125
01:16:56,362 --> 01:16:57,781
Uh-huh?
But they destroyed it.

1126
01:16:57,989 --> 01:16:59,449
Oh, dear.
However...

1127
01:16:59,657 --> 01:17:01,159
Uh-huh?
I pulled a copy.

1128
01:17:01,367 --> 01:17:03,495
A second copy of
the second will?

1129
01:17:03,703 --> 01:17:04,996
Right.
Uh-huh?

1130
01:17:07,707 --> 01:17:10,043
What does it say? Where is it?
What's it all about, dammit?

1131
01:17:10,210 --> 01:17:11,250
Don't keep us in suspense.

1132
01:17:11,294 --> 01:17:13,004
This has been a complete
fucking nightmare.

1133
01:17:13,213 --> 01:17:15,632
Just tell us what
the fuck is going on!

1134
01:17:17,467 --> 01:17:18,885
Serge?

1135
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:20,678
Serge? Serge!

1136
01:17:24,724 --> 01:17:27,060
Bloody hell. They've
strangled the poor slob.

1137
01:17:55,046 --> 01:17:56,047
Come on! Let's go!

1138
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:05,056
ZERO: What do we do
if we catch him?

1139
01:18:05,181 --> 01:18:06,224
GUSTAVE H: I don't know.

1140
01:18:06,432 --> 01:18:08,726
He's a homicidal psychopath.
Let's stop.

1141
01:18:08,935 --> 01:18:11,187
I can't. I can barely steer.

1142
01:19:19,005 --> 01:19:22,634
You sick, pathetic creep.
I hate you.

1143
01:19:35,355 --> 01:19:37,774
"'If this do be me end,
farewell!'

1144
01:19:37,857 --> 01:19:39,192
"cried the wounded piper-boy,

1145
01:19:40,777 --> 01:19:41,903
"whilst the muskets cracked

1146
01:19:41,986 --> 01:19:43,363
"and the yeomen

1147
01:19:43,529 --> 01:19:44,697
"And the ramparts fell.

01:19:46,366 --> 01:19:49,953
"'Methinks me breathes me
last, me fears!' said he..."

1149
01:19:50,161 --> 01:19:52,038
Holy shit! You got him!

1150
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:54,207
Well done, Zero!

1151
01:20:05,385 --> 01:20:07,720
<i>Gustave H! You are
a fugitive from justice!</i>

1152
01:20:07,971 --> 01:20:10,556
<i>Surrender lawfully and
I will personally vouchsafe</i>

1153
01:20:10,848 --> 01:20:11,849
<i>your fair treatment.</i>

1154
01:20:11,975 --> 01:20:13,518
<i>Do not attempt to flee!</i>

1155
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:15,228
ZERO: What do you think?
I don't know.

1156
01:20:15,395 --> 01:20:16,813
I'd rather jump off
this cliff right now

1157
01:20:16,938 --> 01:20:18,314
than go back to fucking prison.

1158
01:20:18,523 --> 01:20:20,963
I say we steal that sick maniac's
motorcycle, go fetch Agatha,

1159
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:22,193
<i>take back Boy with Apple</i>

1160
01:20:22,277 --> 01:20:23,903
and head for the Maltese
Riviera, once and for all.

1161
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:26,906
Very good! You're so extraordinary, Zero.
Thank you.

1162
01:20:27,073 --> 01:20:29,575
A moment of silence in
memoriam of a devoted servant

1163
01:20:29,826 --> 01:20:32,537
killed violently during
the conduct of his duties.

1164
01:20:35,498 --> 01:20:37,500
Goodbye, Serge.

1165
01:20:39,002 --> 01:20:41,004
Okay, let's go.

1166
01:20:53,808 --> 01:20:55,601
<i>MR. MOUSTAFA:
The war began at midnight.</i>

1167
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:58,271
<i>Pffeifelstad fell by lunch
under heavy shelling,</i>

1168
01:20:58,479 --> 01:21:01,816
<i>and 10 battalions surged across
the long western border.</i>

1169
01:21:02,025 --> 01:21:03,818
<i>High-command
advanced to Nebelsbad.</i>

1170
01:21:16,039 --> 01:21:19,667
Compliments of <i>Herr</i> Mendl,
for the executive staff.

1171
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:26,155
CHUCK: General Stieglitz requests a garden-view
sitting room with an extra roll-away.

1172
01:21:26,174 --> 01:21:28,134
Let's put him in
the Duke Leopold Suite.

1173
01:21:28,343 --> 01:21:30,011
Secretary Woroniecki's
office cabled.

1174
01:21:30,219 --> 01:21:33,806
He's checking in a day early.
Rooms 401 -2-3.

1175
01:21:33,973 --> 01:21:35,641
Tell Tactical Logistics
we're moving them

1176
01:21:35,808 --> 01:21:37,369
to a standard double
on the third floor.

1177
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:39,395
They'll need more
space than that.

1178
01:22:02,502 --> 01:22:07,173
GUSTAVE H: The beginning of the end of
the end of the beginning has begun.

1179
01:22:07,340 --> 01:22:10,385
A sad finale played off-key
on a broken-down saloon piano

1180
01:22:10,593 --> 01:22:13,179
in the outskirts of
a forgotten ghost town.

1181
01:22:13,346 --> 01:22:15,348
I'd rather not bear witness
to such blasphemy.

1182
01:22:15,556 --> 01:22:16,557
Me neither.

1183
01:22:16,766 --> 01:22:19,060
The Grand Budapest
has become a troops' barracks.

1184
01:22:19,268 --> 01:22:21,729
I shall never cross its
threshold again in my lifetime.

1185
01:22:21,938 --> 01:22:23,439
Me neither.
Never again shall I...

1186
01:22:23,689 --> 01:22:26,692
Actually, I think we might be going
in there right now after all.

1187
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:29,946
Dmitri.

1188
01:22:32,907 --> 01:22:34,617
Agatha.

1189
01:22:45,294 --> 01:22:47,535
Good evening, Mr. Desgoffe und Taxis.
I'm Monsieur Chuck.

1190
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:50,883
We've booked you and your sisters
into the King Ferdinand Suite.

1191
01:22:51,092 --> 01:22:53,052
Good evening. General von
Shrecker asked me...

1192
01:22:53,261 --> 01:22:54,554
Who's that?

1193
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:56,055
I beg your pardon?

1194
01:22:56,222 --> 01:22:58,975
I think that girl's
got my picture. Excuse me.

1195
01:23:15,575 --> 01:23:17,577
AGATHA: Six.
DMITRI: Hold it.

1196
01:23:20,746 --> 01:23:21,789
DMITRI: Six.

1197
01:23:24,959 --> 01:23:26,752
Compliments of <i>Herr</i> Mendl.

1198
01:23:42,935 --> 01:23:43,936
GUSTAVE H: Excuse me.

1199
01:23:44,103 --> 01:23:46,304
Have you seen a pastry girl
with a package under her arm

1200
01:23:46,439 --> 01:23:47,639
in the last minute and a half?

1201
01:23:47,773 --> 01:23:50,213
Yep. She just got on the elevator
with Mr. Desgoffe und Taxis.

1202
01:23:50,276 --> 01:23:52,487
Thank you.

1203
01:23:52,695 --> 01:23:54,113
I'm sorry.
Who are you?

1204
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:55,907
Otto, sir, the new Lobby Boy.

1205
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:57,617
You haven't been
trained properly.

1206
01:23:57,825 --> 01:23:59,952
A Lobby Boy never provides
information of that kind.

1207
01:24:00,119 --> 01:24:02,121
You're a stone wall.
Understood?

1208
01:24:18,971 --> 01:24:20,556
Pretty picture.

1209
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:22,391
Sixth floor.

1210
01:25:06,185 --> 01:25:07,895
<i>Where's Boy with Apple?</i>

1211
01:25:08,854 --> 01:25:11,107
None of your goddamn business!

1212
01:25:11,899 --> 01:25:15,570
I'm going to blast your candy-ass
once and for all right now.

1213
01:25:25,037 --> 01:25:26,581
Drop your weapon!

1214
01:25:48,811 --> 01:25:50,730
Cease fire! Cease fire! Whoa!

1215
01:25:50,938 --> 01:25:52,273
Stop it!

1216
01:25:52,481 --> 01:25:54,066
Who's shooting who?

1217
01:25:54,233 --> 01:25:56,736
That's Gustave H! The escaped
murderer and art thief.

1218
01:25:56,944 --> 01:25:58,112
I've got him cornered!

1219
01:25:58,321 --> 01:25:59,739
That's Dmitri
Desgoffe und Taxis!

1220
01:25:59,947 --> 01:26:01,949
He's responsible for the
killing of Deputy Kovacs,

1221
01:26:02,158 --> 01:26:04,994
Serge X and his club-footed
sister, plus his own mother!

1222
01:26:06,579 --> 01:26:08,748
Nobody move.
Everybody's under arrest.

1223
01:26:10,124 --> 01:26:12,418
Who's out the window?

1224
01:26:12,585 --> 01:26:14,587
Agatha!

1225
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:21,802
310-bis.

1226
01:26:22,011 --> 01:26:23,220
Hang on! Here I come!

1227
01:26:48,371 --> 01:26:49,972
AGATHA: Something's
on the back of the...

1228
01:26:56,128 --> 01:26:57,129
Agatha!

1229
01:26:57,296 --> 01:26:59,006
Agatha!

1230
01:26:59,215 --> 01:27:01,217
Are you all right?
I think so.

1231
01:27:02,885 --> 01:27:04,845
Something's on
the back of the picture.

1232
01:27:18,234 --> 01:27:19,235
<i>MR. MOUSTAFA:
She left everything</i>

1233
01:27:19,318 --> 01:27:21,028
<i>to Monsieur Gustave, of course.</i>

1234
01:27:22,988 --> 01:27:25,324
<i>The mansion,

<i>the factories, which produced
weapons, medicine and textiles,</i>

1236

01:27:35,668 --> 01:27:38,045
<i>and perhaps

01:27:38,379 --> 01:27:44,051
<i>this very institution,

1239
01:27:44,385 --> 01:27:45,886

<i>from the narrow desk still found

1242

<i>He was the same

1243
01:27:56,188 --> 01:27:59,525
<i>insecure, vain,
superficial, blond, needy.</i>

1244
01:28:00,359 --> 01:28:02,570
<i>In the end he was even rich.</i>

1245
01:28:03,946 --> 01:28:07,116
<i>He did not succeed, however,
in growing old.</i>

1246
01:28:11,871 --> 01:28:13,747
"Dearly beloved,
we are gathered together..."

1247
01:28:13,956 --> 01:28:15,791
<i>MR. MOUSTAFA:
Nor did my darling Agatha.</i>

1248
01:28:16,041 --> 01:28:18,294
<i>She and our infant son would
be killed two years later</i>

1249
01:28:18,544 --> 01:28:21,380
<i>by the Prussian grippe.
An absurd little disease.</i>

1251

1252
01:28:30,097 --> 01:28:31,932
<i>On the 21st day

1253
01:28:32,141 --> 01:28:34,894

<i>we traveled with
Monsieur Gustave to Lutz.</i>

1256
01:28:38,564 --> 01:28:40,816
In answer to your earlier
question, by the way,

1257
01:28:41,066 --> 01:28:42,902
of course.

1258
01:28:44,737 --> 01:28:47,573
Zero asked me about my humble
beginnings in the hotel trade.

1259
01:28:47,740 --> 01:28:50,075
I was, perhaps, for a time,
considered the best Lobby Boy

1260
01:28:50,284 --> 01:28:52,661
we'd ever had at
the Grand Budapest.

1261
01:28:52,912 --> 01:28:54,330
I think I can say that.

1262
01:28:54,580 --> 01:28:56,415
This one finally surpassed me.

1263
01:28:56,624 --> 01:28:59,585
Although, I must say,
he had an exceptional teacher.

1264
01:28:59,752 --> 01:29:00,920
Truly.

1265
01:29:06,175 --> 01:29:09,136
"Whence came these two
radiant, celestial brothers,

1266
01:29:09,345 --> 01:29:10,638

"One from the East

1269
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:20,022
Very good.

1270
01:29:20,272 --> 01:29:22,274
Don't flirt with her.

1271
01:29:24,610 --> 01:29:26,862
Why are we stopping
at a barley field again?

1272
01:29:35,204 --> 01:29:38,332
I find these black
uniforms very drab.

1273
01:29:42,836 --> 01:29:44,129
Well, hello there, chaps.

1274
01:29:44,213 --> 01:29:45,798
We were just talking about you.

1275
01:29:46,048 --> 01:29:47,841
Documents, please.

1276
01:29:47,967 --> 01:29:49,802
With pleasure, as always.

1277
01:29:54,223 --> 01:29:56,016

formally introduced.

1279

Uh, that's a migratory visa with
stage three worker status, darling.

1282
01:30:11,991 --> 01:30:12,992
Read this.

1283
01:30:22,334 --> 01:30:23,669

01:30:23,836 --> 01:30:25,170

I give you my word, if you
lay a finger on this man,

1286
01:30:29,883 --> 01:30:32,052
I'll see you
dishonorably discharged,

1287
01:30:32,261 --> 01:30:35,347
locked up in the stockade
and hanged by sundown.

1288
01:30:36,682 --> 01:30:38,517
<i>MR. MOUSTAFA: There are still

In the end they shot him.

1296
01:31:10,049 --> 01:31:12,051

For a little while.

1324
