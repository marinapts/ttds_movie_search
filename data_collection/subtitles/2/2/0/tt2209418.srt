1
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,283
So you got everything?
Mm-hm.

2
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,120
You gonna play
video games the whole flight

3
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,965
or do you think you might
actually crack a book?

4
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,531
Probably read some.

5
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,162
Well, if I write you an e-mail,
don't be scared to write back.

6
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,166
Let your old man know what you're
thinking about, what's going on.

7
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,681
Yeah.
If you want, we could try Skyping

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,968
once a week or something.
All right.

9
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,565
Yeah. Okay.

10
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,927
You got the drawings
for your science deal?

11
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,167
Yeah, think so.

12
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,164
Well, they turned out great,
by the way. Really great.

13
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,651
Thanks.

14
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,286
What...? Is your computer charged?
Yeah.

15
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,481
What do you think is the first thing
you're gonna do when you get home?

16
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,881
I don't know.
Hm? Oh.

17
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,642
I really cherish this communication we have.
You know, it's just...

18
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,882
Your answers are so...
What?

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,291
Just keep practicing the piano.
You're really good.

20
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,046
They spend so much time
at that school of yours...

21
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,368
Music is something you'll use in life.

22
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,291
And don't forget to...
You want those sesame things.

23
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,891
Yeah.
All right.

24
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,644
There you go.
Thank you.

25
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,444
Okay.

26
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,328
I'll probably make it over there in October.
I'll try to see you in that first recital.

27
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,126
And hopefully catch
a soccer game while I'm there.

28
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,484
I might not even play soccer
this year.

29
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,081
Oh, that'd be a big mistake.
Trust me.

30
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,011
I'm not that good.
Oh, no, you're pretty good.

31
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,407
You are. Huh?

32
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,400
I missed summer training camp. The
chances of me starting are miniscule.

33
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,768
Well, just tell the coach
the situation.

34
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,884
Your dad lives in Europe.
You really wanted to be there.

35
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,402
You know, blah, blah, blah. Blame me."My
parents stink, but I'm really serious."

36
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,648
But I'm not serious, Dad.

37
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,047
I don't care that much.

38
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,646
Well, you don't have to decide right now.
You know, just think about it.

39
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,850
All I'm saying is that team sports
are important, you know?

40
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,730
Here we are.

41
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,407
I love this airport.
It's awesome.

42
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,331
Heh. It's cool, right? You
excited about seeing your mom?

43
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,845
Yeah, and all my friends.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,446
Yeah. What about your
boarding pass, passport?

45
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,126
You feel confident
about making the connection?

46
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,847
I did this before.
But not with a tricky connection like this.

47
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,646
Remember, when you land,
you stay in your seat,

48
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,526
somebody from the airline is gonna
take you to the gate, all right?

49
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,486
It's not a problem.
Okay. All right. Heh-heh-heh.

50
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,889
Oh, boy.

51
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,721
Well, looks like maybe we should
just do this thing, huh? Hm?

52
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,644
Okay, come here. Oh, God.

53
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,366
I'm gonna do my best
to make that recital, okay?

54
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,490
You know, I wouldn't bother.

55
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,926
Heh. What makes you say that?
I'm not being mean, but it'd be easier

56
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,044
if you didn't come to the recital.
How come?

57
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,811
Be better if you visited
on a "nothing" weekend.

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,324
But I wanna see you play.
It's because Mom hates you so much.

59
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,650
She'd be really stressed if you were
there and then it'd be tense for me.

60
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,446
You know, go on.
Thank you.

61
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,649
We wouldn't have any time to hang out.
Don't worry. We'll figure that out.

62
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,684
I just don't want you to worry
about it, you know?

63
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,326
I mean, you know
how much I miss you, right?

64
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,041
Why do you think
she still hates me so much?

65
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,921
I don't know. I think she hates Daniel
more than she hates you.

66
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,767
Right. Hey, don't worry.
I'll figure something out.

67
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,207
We should just do this thing.
Yeah.

68
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,203
Is there anything
I can do to help?

69
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,880
I don't know.
But you know I love you, right?

70
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,684
Yeah, I know.
All right.

71
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,008
This has been the best summer
of my life.

72
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,089
Really?
Yeah.

73
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,527
Well, me too.

74
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,326
I told you this Greece thing
was gonna be great.

75
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,602
And it was.
Okay. All right.

76
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,125
I love you, pal.

77
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,810
Love you too, Dad.
Okay.

78
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,361
Okay, shake my hand.
All right.

79
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,528
Bye.
All right. See you.

80
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,365
Okay.

81
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,166
Okay.

82
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,241
So, what's going on?

83
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,171
They voted against it.
What? The wind turbines?

84
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,160
Six months dealing with those people,
everyone agreed it was great.

85
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,367
So, what happened?

86
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,966
They don't like the way
it looks on that hill.

87
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,481
No. I thought it was a done deal.
It was.

88
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,251
That's what's so infuriating.
Can they do that?

89
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,649
Of course, they've done it.
That's it. It's over, <i>finis.</i>

90
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,881
I'm sorry.
No, no. It's just so frustrating.

91
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,963
I can't take it anymore.

92
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,527
I'm gonna take that job
with Remy.

93
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,882
No, no. No, you don't
wanna work for him.

94
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,963
Why not?
For the government?

95
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,444
This is different. We need laws. That's
the only way anything is gonna happen.

96
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,444
Not the only way. You have
been getting good work done.

97
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,762
I've been thinking.
This is the way to go.

98
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,161
Let me remind you
you do not like that guy.

99
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,085
You worked for him before.
You complained about him.

100
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,561
He gets things done.
That's how I'm gonna be.

101
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,131
Okay.
A real bitch, okay?

102
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,127
Well, every time I look at that guy, all I
see is ambition. Sorry, I don't trust him.

103
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,887
He's going from nonprofit to government
to have people kiss his ass.

104
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,445
I don't care about him.

105
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,887
And I think
you're gonna be miserable.

106
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,560
Just with all the politicking
and compromise.

107
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,764
I've made my decision.
I'm tired of being the do-gooder

108
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,651
that rolls a boulder up
and watches it roll down.

109
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,088
Isn't Remy the guy who used to
throw his pens at his assistant?

110
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,402
I should have taken
this job a year ago.

111
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,770
I was scared of the amount of work, but
I think it's the best opportunity.

112
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,241
And it's more money,
and I'm doing it.

113
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,171
Okay. Are you sure?

114
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,603
No, I'm not sure of anything, okay?
All right. Heh.

115
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,041
What's gonna happen
to everyone if I leave?

116
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,766
Like Françoise and...
I mean, they count on me.

117
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,365
What do you think?

118
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,245
Should I take it or not?
I don't have an opinion.

119
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,445
I don't wanna see you rush into a
decision because of this wind turbine.

120
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,331
Not just that. It's been
stirring in me all summer.

121
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,891
I know.
I should do it.

122
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,242
All right... Then do it.
I'm doing it.

123
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,926
I'm doing it. All right?

124
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,208
Oh, God.
I wish things were simpler.

125
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,046
If I leave, I get fucked,
if I stay, I get fucked.

126
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,480
Heh, heh.
There's always a catch.

127
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,086
The world is fucked.
Yeah, maybe.

128
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,564
Oh, God. We finally have a vacation
and the girls are sick for two weeks.

129
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,481
I know. I have the perfect son.
He lives a million miles away.

130
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,166
Or the love of your life can't clean up
after himself or learn how to shave.

131
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,643
Who's that? I mean, you're not
talking about Captain Cleanup.

132
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,765
Captain Cleanup. The one that's been
missing in action all these years.

133
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,490
What'd you expect at this point

134
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,287
in your life, missy?
Ay, ay, ay! God.

135
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,448
Oh, look at them.
They're so cute.

136
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,041
They look like conjoined twins.
Heh.

137
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,447
Oh, my God,
I'm gonna take a picture.

138
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,247
Hey, did Ella finish that apple?

139
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,201
The...
Take food out of your child's mouth?

140
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,805
Yeah.
Okay.

141
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,361
Well, it's all brown.

142
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,046
No, no, no,
there's a spot here.

143
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,486
Mm.

144
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,931
Ella, this is evidence of your
father stealing food from you.

145
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,003
If you become bulimic
or anorexic,

146
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,685
Heh. Jesus.
It's not my fault.

147
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,287
Don't blame it all on your mother.
Ella, this is a family apple.

148
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,046
I'm teaching you the value of sharing.
I love you, honey.

149
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,248
Aw. So sweet.

150
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,290
You will remember this vacation
different than we will.

151
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,568
That's for sure.
I see that with my mom.

152
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,166
She remembers my childhood
different than I do.

153
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,840
Please, stop filming me.
Okay.

154
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,922
God. I love your mom.
You're always so hard on her.

155
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,528
You missed the fucked-up years.
You're just getting the good era.

156
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,048
The fucked-up years. Heh, heh. That
reminds me, talking about fucked up,

157
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,171
did I ever tell you the story
of my little Cleopatra kitty?

158
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,281
No.
No? I think you would remember if I did.

159
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,849
It's the story... You know, when I was a
little girl, I had this cat named Cleopatra.

160
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,731
Every spring, she'd jump
the fence, get pregnant

161
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,010
and always end up
with a litter of exactly two kittens.

162
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,770
Two kitties, huh?
Two kitties.

163
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,928
Every time, every year,
two cats.

164
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,724
I mean, it's just amazing.

165
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,766
Then one day, I was, like, around 30,
and was having lunch with my dad

166
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,969
and I was remembering...
Mentioning little Cleopatra,

167
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,281
and he was like:

168
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,202
"The hardest thing I ever had to do
was to kill those cute little kittens."

169
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,606
And I was like, "What?"

170
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,531
It turns out... Listen to this.

171
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,644
There were sometimes
up to seven kittens in that litter.

172
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,887
Oh, no.

173
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,042
He would take five of them,
Oh, no.

174
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,407
Put them into a bag
with a bunch of ether.

175
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,688
That's terrible.

176
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,127
That was like...

177
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,449
He had forgotten the lie he
and my mom had told me as a kid.

178
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,729
How did he decide which ones to kill?
I asked him that.

179
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,447
"Did you take the fluffiest? Cutest?"
Right.

180
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,126
You know?
He just started to cry.

181
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,448
Aw.
Poor Daddy.

182
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,684
Oh. We said we were gonna stop.
They wanted to see the ruins.

183
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,927
Should we?

184
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,650
Well, Ella really wanted to.

185
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,128
- But should we wake them up?
- I don't know.

186
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,290
On our way back to the airport,
we can catch them. Hm?

187
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,244
You know we won't.
Probably not.

188
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,561
Oh, God.

189
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,722
So long, ancient ruins.
Shh.

190
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,571
What's so great about you anyway?
Seen one, seen them all.

191
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,408
Oh, my God. We are shitty parents.
We should have stopped.

192
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,369
Ah, it's okay.
It's culture. Go back.

193
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,444
You gotta put character into these kids.
Yeah, yeah.

194
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,725
We're teaching them a valuable lesson.
If you snooze, you lose in this world.

195
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,366
And when the girls are in rehab
Ha-ha-ha.

196
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,285
Recovering from 10 years
of addiction to coke and speed,

197
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,484
they'll say, "We never felt
comfortable falling asleep."

198
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,844
"Daddy used to tell us, 'You snooze, you
lose."' And that'll be your fault again.

199
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,731
Yeah, well, we are shitty parents.
I know.

200
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,089
Oh... Saying goodbye
to Hank sucked.

201
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,961
Why, was he upset?

202
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,403
No, no. He said it was
the best summer of his life.

203
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,931
Well, that's great.

204
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,681
I mean, I wouldn't worry too much
about him. We spoke a bunch.

205
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,089
You know what his main concerns are?
What?

206
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,285
Pimples and how girls perceive him.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

207
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,000
What do you mean? I'm not like that.
Oh, please.

208
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,764
What?
That's all you think about.

209
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,127
What?
Women. I mean...

210
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:42,285
Heh. I'm not complaining,
I'm getting a lot of attention.

211
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,008
But you never stop ogling girls, like:
I don't ogle girls. I don't ogle girls.

212
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,404
I make love to them with my eyes.

213
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,881
I like the Spanish guy.
Or is it Greek?

214
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,806
I don't know where I'm from,
but I'm very hairy.

215
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,966
Well, I think... You know,
Henry might have, you know...

216
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,207
What?

217
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,085
With that little Melina girl.

218
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,284
I don't know.
He had a crush, but...

219
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,726
Oh, are you kidding?
What?

220
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,049
Why do you think he said
it was the best summer of his life?

221
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,720
Because he and I
had a good time together?

222
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,890
Jesse.
No, huh?

223
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,481
So, what, you think they...?
Of course.

224
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,001
They kissed?
Yeah, they kissed. Yeah, yeah.

225
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,323
I was sworn to secrecy, but he told me.
What did he say?

226
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,091
I'm not supposed to tell you.
I'm not gonna talk.

227
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,009
Hey, hey. Come on.
Okay.

228
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,649
He told me he was worried... You
know, concerned about the kissing.

229
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,370
You know, tongue. Her tongue.

230
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,443
What, he kissed her?
Yeah.

231
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:50,089
But he was so cute, all nervous,
all red, biting his cheek.

232
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,645
Like when he was little.

233
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,320
So he and Melina were a real thing?
Yeah.

234
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,483
What's gonna happen now?

235
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,126
I don't know. They must be
friends on Facebook.

236
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,005
Keep in touch for a while.
Hey, hey. What if they end up

237
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,448
spending their life together, you know?
You're so corny.

238
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,369
Ha-ha-ha. No.
Sometimes, I'm just like...

239
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,887
What are you, a 12-year-old girl?
I'm just...

240
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,686
First love, do you even
remember who it was?

241
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,805
Yeah, I do. It was you.
Oh, please, like you were a virgin at 23.

242
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,805
You said first love,
not first sexual experience.

243
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,964
Fine. I'm the first woman
you ever fell in love with?

244
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,446
Yeah.
I don't think so.

245
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,611
First one I felt truly connected to, sure.
What, I wasn't your first love?

246
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,604
No, of course not.
Oh.

247
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,569
No, I just... I thought I was.
Oh... Ha-ha-ha.

248
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,326
Jesse, stop this. It's dumb.
It's okay. Not a big deal.

249
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,961
No. Okay, how old are you?
Come on.

250
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,209
I'm 41 and I've loved only you.

251
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,482
You are so, so working
on our little night already.

252
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,642
Hell, yeah. I got a Trojan in my
billfold, and a rocket in my pocket.

253
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,043
I'm stuck with
an American teenager.

254
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,084
I can't believe it.

255
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,760
Do we have to do
all that stuff later?

256
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,088
What? Oh, yeah, come on.

257
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:16,251
It means a lot to Patrick. Ariadni and
Stefanos are already there prepping.

258
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,681
The kids wanted one more big time.
No, no.

259
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,569
No, no,
but I meant the hotel later.

260
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,571
I'm not sure I want to go...
Hi, sweetie.

261
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,091
Yeah.

262
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,529
Oh, okay, okay, okay.
Well, it's fine. It's fine.

263
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,485
Call me from London.
Have a good flight. Bye.

264
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,371
They were telling them
to turn everything off.

265
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,889
And I asked him to call me from
the plane. I don't like when he flies.

266
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,925
What?

267
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,001
What is it?
It's just...

268
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,806
I don't know.
I don't know. I don't...

269
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,887
I just don't think I can keep
doing this.

270
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,525
What?

271
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,651
It's just every summer, every Christmas.
You know, it's like...

272
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,841
I mean... It wouldn't be so bad,
It makes me ill every time.

273
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,489
You know, like if we were sending
him to boarding school or just...

274
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,843
I don't know, if his mom and I
got along a little bit better.

275
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,771
It's like we're sending him back
across enemy lines.

276
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,405
It really hit me this time.

277
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,809
It's, like, he's gonna be
a freshman in high school.

278
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,606
Four more years
and he's gonna be on his own.

279
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,168
Maybe that's good. Only four years.
This is the crucial time.

280
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,843
I just feel like I should be there for him.
Like it's now or never, you know?

281
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,403
No. What do you mean?

282
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:42,491
I just thought somehow he'd end up
living with us somewhere along the way.

283
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,489
You know,
time's going by so fast.

284
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,489
And here we are, it's high school.

285
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,526
There's girls. Next thing you know,
it's college applications.

286
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,484
You're right, maybe it's time.

287
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:57,049
I mean, it's time to tell his mom all this
and ask if he can come and live with us.

288
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,527
He'd love it.
We can put him in that bilin...

289
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,967
That's never gonna happen,
all right?

290
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,767
She's never gonna give me one thing
she's not legally obligated to.

291
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,447
You wanna call that lawyer again?
No. He's terrible.

292
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,085
Should I call his mother?

293
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,487
Uh, no. Please. Never again.

294
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,451
Look, he doesn't even know
how to throw a baseball.

295
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,125
Who cares?

296
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,245
It's just... He leads with his elbow.
He throws like a girl.

297
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,091
It's not your fault.
No, it is my fault.

298
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,046
A father is supposed to teach you that.
He just doesn't like baseball.

299
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,971
It's an example.
It's a metaphor for everything.

300
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,051
He's turning 14,
and he needs his father.

301
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,522
Jesse, I'm not moving to Chicago.

302
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,361
Did I ask you to? Where did that
come from? I'm thinking out loud.

303
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,450
This is the one thing I promised
myself I'd never do

304
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,449
and I look up and I'm doing it.

305
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,645
Well, listen, you're a wonderful father.
He loves the relationship you have.

306
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,605
He loves the letters.
He doesn't read the letters.

307
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,486
He reads them. He doesn't compliment.
I know if I miss these years,

308
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,762
they are never coming back.

309
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,763
Oh, my God.
What?

310
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,287
This is where it ends.

311
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,685
What are you talking about?

312
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,360
This is how people start breaking up.
Oh, my God.

313
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,291
You just jumped off a cliff.
No, I'm marking this.

314
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,809
This is the day you light the ticking
bomb that will destroy our lives.

315
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,527
Yeah.
Okay.

316
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,326
First, you don't light
a ticking bomb. You set it.

317
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,082
It has a timer. That's why it ticks.
Whatever. Well, it's ticking right now.

318
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,126
This is how it happens. You're unhappy,
you blame it on the other person.

319
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,001
Resentment grows, you break up.
You're just doing this to shut me up.

320
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,401
Not at all. No.
That's what you're doing.

321
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,410
I'm surprised we lasted this long.
The hyperbole.

322
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,644
We're on parallel tracks,
but now the tracks have crossed.

323
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,609
I'm going west. You're going east.

324
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,088
This is how it happens. I've seen it.
Katherine and Alexander...

325
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,926
You're kidding, right? You're kidding?
Well, no.

326
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,406
I'm kidding.

327
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,170
And I'm not.

328
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,567
All right?

329
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,330
I'm just...

330
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,364
This is it.
How much longer to the ruins?

331
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,767
Oh, they were closed.

332
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,126
Yeah.
We... Yeah.

333
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,041
We're gonna catch them on the way
back when we're going to the airport.

334
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,287
Okay?
Exactly.

335
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,086
We'll leave early, right? Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.

336
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,521
What happened to my apple?

337
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,967
Your apple.

338
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,649
Right?

339
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,168
Give me the list.
I don't have it.

340
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,964
It's in your wallet.

341
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,525
In your wallet.

342
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,529
Okay.
Yeah.

343
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,202
Okay, I'm the general.

344
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,090
Who made you general?
The general, okay?

345
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,441
Private Cleanup.
You don't touch anything.

346
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,963
Ugh.

347
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,249
Nina!

348
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,324
Ariadni. Ah!

349
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,240
You gotta do better than that.
No, no, no.

350
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,970
I got you. Oh. Oh! Oh!

351
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,646
Oh, where's my team?
Where's my team?

352
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,724
The red ones.

353
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,411
Okay. Pepper.

354
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,603
Uh, I read both. The first one is
<i>That Time</i>, second is <i>This Time.</i>

355
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,848
First is <i>This Time,</i>
second is <i>That Time</i>.

356
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,601
We've got a joke in our family
that <i>This</i> brought us back together

357
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,001
- and <i>That</i> paid for our apartment.
- Okay.

358
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:00,210
It must be a little weird for Celine,
the way she's in the book like that.

359
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,050
Why? She's gotten used to it.

360
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,165
Second one is sexy. He misses
the plane, they black out the windows

361
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,882
and they have sex for days and days
and days like there's no tomorrow, whoa.

362
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,447
Did you guys actually do that?

363
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,640
- You did that, huh?
- You read Jesse's third book?

364
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,723
It's better than the first two.

365
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,685
Took longer to write
than the first two put together.

366
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,726
Third one I didn't read. My wife gave
it to me, but it's too long for me.

367
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,843
The title is long. What's the title?

368
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,686
<i>Temporary Cast Members of a Long
Running But Lime Seen Production</i>

369
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,561
<i>of a Play Called Fleeting.</i>
Well, exactly, my point.

370
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,762
Everybody else thought
it was too long.

371
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,884
Well, it's a better book.
It's so much more ambitious.

372
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,131
What's that?

373
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,006
No, he says he likes all the books.

374
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,123
He does. Huh?

375
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,009
Well...
Ha, ha.

376
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,362
I love it here.
This place is amazing.

377
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,887
Those tomatoes are so amazing.
I can...

378
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,284
I can smell them.

379
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,164
It smells so good.

380
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,131
Yeah, Patrick
is very proud of them.

381
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,489
I know it's stupid, but when
we were about to leave Paris,

382
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,571
I was nervous to come here. Now we're
about to leave, I don't wanna go.

383
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,161
- Why were you nervous?
- Yeah, why was that?

384
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,251
This place, it's so full of thousands
of years of myth and tragedy.

385
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,209
Thought something
was gonna happen.

386
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,330
You thought the minotaur
was going to eat your children?

387
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,330
Yes. Exactly.

388
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,680
Well, I've been working
on this idea

389
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,168
about a group of people
with all these brain abnormalities.

390
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,321
So the book would be like a day in their
life from all their unique points of view.

391
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,364
This older lady has a condition
that makes you feel

392
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,488
like you're in a state of déjà vu.

393
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,928
Every single experience she has
feels like she's had it before.

394
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,050
She could be sitting here,
seemingly functional.

395
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,443
In her head, she's thinking,
"Didn't he already say that?"

396
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,201
"Weren't we were here yesterday
having this exact same conversation?"

397
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,243
Like déjà vu.
Except all the time.

398
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,410
That's the thing, right?
Everything she takes in.

399
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,764
Uh, breakfast, a newspaper, a movie. She's
convinced she's encountered it already.

400
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,363
That's a real condition?
Yeah, it's called, um, persistent déjà...

401
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,483
It's real, but I can't pronounce it.
Ha-ha-ha.

402
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:21,810
Then there's these two other characters
with facial recognition extremes.

403
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,369
There's this one guy and he can't
recognize his wife of 20 years.

404
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:30,042
He looks at himself in the mirror,
and he feels this disconnect

405
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,009
with that man he's looking at.

406
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,767
Then the other character is the opposite.
A middle-aged housewife

407
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,930
with exacting memory of every face
she's ever seen.

408
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,004
She lives in a big city,
but to her, it's a small town.

409
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,524
Like, a taxi drives past and she thinks:
"Oh, that's the driver who dropped me off

410
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,842
at Place des Vosges
three Christmases ago."

411
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,401
Like some old lady
walking on the street, she thinks:

412
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,206
"She sat two seats down from me
on the Metro last year."

413
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,331
So everyone she meets, you know,
to her, feels intimate and connected.

414
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,766
I'm like the first guy.

415
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,123
Like I feel connected to nothing
most of the time, man.

416
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,971
Oh, Achilleas, Anna.
Hey, you guys.

417
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,046
Hey, look at this kid.

418
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,447
He's having the best summer
of us all.

419
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,124
So you were saying
there's three characters, right?

420
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,641
Not just three.
It's a whole group of people.

421
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,447
I'm working on a chapter about a
young Greek man named Achilleas.

422
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,523
- Me?
- Well, he's named after you.

423
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,248
The guy is caught in a loop. All he sees
is the transient nature of everything.

424
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,490
He looks out at the sea, thinks it's gonna
be dry and littered with fossils.

425
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,330
Well, I don't know.

426
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,164
What?
Sounds pretentious.

427
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,931
It won't be pretentious.
It's gonna be funny.

428
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,282
Really funny.
Like, he picks up a book

429
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,882
and he wonders, "Who's gonna be
the last person to read this?"

430
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:56,687
And that's funny? Ha-ha-ha.
Sometimes I kind of think like that.

431
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,401
Okay. So he doesn't get excited
about tits, cars, booze? Nothing.

432
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,011
He just thinks about death.

433
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,483
Well, not so much death, right?
It's just like transformation.

434
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,729
Like he's seeing too far into the future.
Okay.

435
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,962
I like this idea for a novel.

436
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:15,802
Add a character of an old man who can't
remember what he had for breakfast,

437
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,050
but can still hear the song playing
when Sheila Campbell danced topless

438
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,851
on the bar at Jury's
when he was 14 years old.

439
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,610
- That'd work.
- Okay,

440
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,202
you have these people lost in time.
But what's the connection?

441
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,727
Are they gonna have sex?
Don't you need that?

442
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,282
It's not time they're lost in.
It's perception. That's the deal.

443
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,762
No, I'm thinking of setting
the whole novel at a movie.

444
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,965
Like every character comes in contact
with the film <i>On the Waterfront.</i>

445
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,200
Have you seen <i>On the Waterfront?
On the Waterfront?</i>

446
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,920
- Oh, with Brando? Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

447
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:51,483
Yeah, yeah. Okay, the first chapter is
opening weekend, Times Square, 1954.

448
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:56,607
That old lady with perpetual deja vu
walks into the matinée screening, right?

449
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:01,323
Except the whole time she's thinking,
"Haven't I already seen this?"

450
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,205
Yeah.
Another chapter is a 1979

451
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,925
Paris film studies class.

452
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:11,524
Then we have, uh, a Kazan retrospective
in Munich, 1993.

453
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:18,046
That is time. How is that not time?
Yeah, it's time. But it's more perception.

454
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,171
You don't like it?
I think it's gonna be too long. Ha-ha-ha.

455
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,249
Well, I like it.

456
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,967
Don't listen to him. He makes bicycles.
Send it to me in galleys.

457
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,687
Will do.

458
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,722
Watch out.

459
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:43,201
In France, we stuff tomatoes
with tomatoes and peppers with peppers.

460
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,287
We use the same for both because of the way
it reacts differently in terms of taste.

461
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,760
Okay.

462
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,645
Celine, make sure you
don't stuff them too much

463
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,411
because of the way
it overflows in the oven.

464
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,965
Okay.
Gets nasty.

465
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,406
You're doing fine, Celine.

466
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,325
And, especially,
don't listen to Stefanos.

467
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,040
Because he's never made this dish
before or any other dish for that matter.

468
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,441
You know? I mean...

469
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,086
Let go.

470
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,322
Let go of me! Let go.

471
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,690
You guys are fighting.
Ha-ha-ha.

472
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,967
With knives?

473
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,646
Okay, stop it.
Stop fighting with knives.

474
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,969
We're not fighting. We're negotiating.
Yeah.

475
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,043
Negotiating. That's how you call it?

476
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,321
Wow.

477
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,365
It's a system that we have.

478
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,608
Wow. You found a system
that works for you.

479
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,889
I thought it was a relationship.
I like system. That's good.

480
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,963
Not too many, right?
Not too many.

481
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,166
We used to have that system.
Ha-ha-ha.

482
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,688
Not too far, you guys!

483
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,721
I don't wanna let this meal go by
without saying thank you to everyone.

484
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,604
And especially you, Patrick.

485
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,043
We had no idea what we were getting
into these last six weeks.

486
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,288
A letter arrives from the university

487
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,444
inviting us to the southern
Peloponnese of Greece

488
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,768
to the guest house of a great writer?

489
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,201
- Sure, why not?
Ha-ha-ha.

490
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,809
And then at the airport
earlier today,

491
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,322
Hank says this has been
the greatest summer of his life.

492
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,841
That's nice.
And I have to say the same.

493
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,926
Thank you, Patrick. Not just for what
you've done for me and my family,

494
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,203
but for all the ways you're
giving back. To Patrick.

495
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,889
Thank you, thank you. When I first
saw you at the airport, I thought:

496
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,323
"No way a man dressed like that
could be a man of letters."

497
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,683
But now, now I think
I've learned your secret.

498
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,766
We've had many great writers here
over the past decade.

499
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:52,481
But never one who had a partner
more interesting than themselves.

500
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,687
Oh.

501
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,484
I keep telling you. Ha-ha-ha.

502
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,962
And Celine,
it's been so great to have you

503
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,004
and your daughters'
wonderful vitality around here.

504
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,410
And I'm so happy that you were able
to meet my dear friend, Natalia.

505
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,285
Whose husband Elias
was like a brother to me.

506
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,964
- Sorry about the curtains.
- Shouldn't have given cherries.

507
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,447
It was my fault.
So beautiful.

508
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,160
Thanks for including Anna
and me this summer.

509
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,930
He usually puts me to work.

510
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,681
But when I bring Anna, he lets me
sit at the table of the grown-ups.

511
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,326
Hey, welcome to
the grown-ups table.

512
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,244
How long have you two been together?
Since last summer.

513
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,489
We met one year ago in
my last few days here with Grandpa.

514
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,843
Before I had to go back to Athens.
We met at my cast party.

515
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,930
I was doing Shakespeare
at Epidavros. Yup.

516
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,124
So who did you play?
I was Perdita in Winter's Tale.

517
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,606
And she was fantastic.

518
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,923
Remember, Patrick, we went to that?
Ah, Perdita.

519
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,890
"When you do dance,
I wish you a wave o' the sea

520
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,923
that you might ever do nothing
but that."

521
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,731
The way he just performed that
was better than the guy at the play.

522
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,843
People are still talking about that.

523
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,805
The after-party was even better.
It's where we met.

524
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,322
Yeah. I had an old BSA motorcycle.

525
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,850
- Nice.
- We drove around all night.

526
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,522
And then I had to drive her back
to the theater to get her stuff.

527
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,882
And it was dawn.
I'll never forget it.

528
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,409
It's outdoors and seats 12,000 people,
but it was now completely empty.

529
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,811
And she was sitting
way up in the back row.

530
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,040
So I went up on stage
and whispered to her...

531
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,403
Acoustics there are incredible.
I could see his mouth move

532
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,122
and then three seconds later,
I could hear his voice in my ear.

533
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,850
What did he say?

534
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,361
Oh! Okay.
Private. Private.

535
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,928
And then she had to fly back to Paris
a couple of days later.

536
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,766
How did you keep in touch?
We Skyped every day since then.

537
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,329
When we're apart, we have a thing
of putting our laptop by the pillow

538
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,170
and fall asleep together.

539
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,368
- Oh, that's the new romance.
Heh-heh-heh.

540
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,325
And when I wake up,
the screen is usually frozen.

541
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,605
And Anna's face
is in some funny position, like:

542
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,049
Let me ask...
Can I ask a question?

543
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,287
- Please?
- Yeah.

544
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,131
When you guys Skype,
do you, you know...?

545
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,608
Do you go a little crazy?
Oh, God, you're being so vulgar.

546
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,087
I'm just being
an amateur anthropologist

547
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,124
interested in virtual worlds
on a theoretical level.

548
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,561
So now you're an anthropologist?
Yeah.

549
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,401
For instance, the sex of the near
future, I'm not making this up,

550
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,049
but is gonna be just like plugging in,
attaching something to your genitals,

551
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:42,171
and you'll be having virtual intercourse
with anyone of your choice.

552
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,170
You'll be able to program in
all your preferences.

553
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,127
You'll be able to type in what you want
Marilyn Monroe to whisper in your ear.

554
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,805
I might like that.

555
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,485
All right. Come on.
Yes.

556
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,082
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Here, here.

557
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,523
I mean, why not?
More and more of our experiences

558
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,963
are going to take place
in the virtual world, you know?

559
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,045
You're a writer. How are you gonna
feel when a computer can write a book

560
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,885
better than <i>War and Peace?</i>
It'll never happen.

561
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,010
It's only a question about
when it's going to happen.

562
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,250
I think I'm gonna feel about it the same
way Kasparov felt when they could

563
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,449
no longer compete with that computer.
Big Blue.

564
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,365
Right. Nobody thought a computer
could beat our best.

565
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,127
"A machine lacks
that ineffable human instinct."

566
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,244
And then... You know,
and now we can't even compete.

567
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,081
I saw a documentary where they were
doing an experiment on a lab rat.

568
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,770
And he was wired up

569
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,930
and he could push a switch
and have an orgasm.

570
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:43,569
And so the scientists were sort of
laughing at this pathetic little creature

571
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,810
while it ignored his food and water
and didn't do anything else.

572
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,684
And eventually it just died.

573
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,247
I mean,
I think that's the future of humanity.

574
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,051
You know, just: ALL: Ha-ha-ha.

575
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,123
And die.

576
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,408
Well, well, maybe so,

577
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:04,686
but every generation believes that
they're witnessing the end of the world,

578
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,526
but I feel
that I'm actually living it.

579
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:12,248
Okay, I have a question for you, Patrick. I
think a lot of people are feeling that way.

580
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,842
That we're this kind of
pleasure-obsessed, porn-addled,

581
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,328
materialists,
ceding our humanity to technology

582
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,649
at the same moment that
computers are becoming sentient.

583
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,322
So, what my question is,
is this notion of self to begin with.

584
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,360
Well, it's written over the portals
to the temple of Apollo at Delphi.

585
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,605
It says, <i>"gnothi seauton"</i>,
which means "Know thyself."

586
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,280
But we're kind of 99 percent
automated already.

587
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,563
No. Our personality
or this thing we think of as ourself

588
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,326
is a tiny fraction
of what the brain is doing.

589
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,802
Most of it is automated body functions.
What is it we're ceding?

590
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,886
No, if this notion of self is such a
small percentage of you, sweetie,

591
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,407
how come I always hear
so much about it?

592
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,571
Well, just like my penis. It's not that big.
It's a small part of myself,

593
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,724
but it needs a lot of attention.
His too.

594
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,281
Ha-ha-ha.
And how did you two meet?

595
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,005
- You don't know?
- What?

596
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,884
You have to read Jesse's books.

597
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,482
If you wanna know what it's like
to have sex with me, read away.

598
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,644
Read away.
Oh, excuse me, Stefanos.

599
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,968
- No, no. I mean it's well-written.
Ha-ha-ha.

600
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,527
Yeah.
Thank you. We met about 18 years ago.

601
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,122
We kind of, sort of fell in love
a little bit, and then we...

602
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,888
A bit. Then we lost track of each other.
A decade later, we ran into each other.

603
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,407
We didn't run into each other.
We didn't?

604
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,285
No. You wrote a book "inspired"
by our meeting.

605
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,529
Yeah.
I read about it and went to look for him.

606
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,210
- Pretty romantic.
- It was.

607
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,051
Not really. Not really.
He neglects to mention

608
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,402
he was married, had a kid...
Details.

609
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,170
That part was a disaster.

610
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,408
It wasn't. It was inevitable.
Yeah.

611
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,291
The first time we have sex
without a condom, twins.

612
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,842
I've been chained to the sink ever since.
One pitch, two-run homer. Boom.

613
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,526
It's not that bad.
The girls are so beautiful.

614
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,451
- They're cute.
Ha-ha-ha.

615
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,365
Okay. No, no.
It has some upsides, okay.

616
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,245
Let me tell you right now, Anna,
how to keep a man.

617
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,646
You gotta let them win

618
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,531
at all the silly little games they like.
Oh, okay.

619
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,724
When I met Jesse, we were playing
pinball. I was winning.

620
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,121
The foundational lie
to our relationship.

621
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,290
I let the ball go down the middle.
She can't beat me.

622
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,885
It builds their confidence.

623
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,011
If I didn't let him win at every game,
we would never have sex.

624
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,205
I mean, I'm sorry to say it,
but he's actually a closet macho.

625
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,448
He dreams of having a bimbo
for a wife.

626
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,480
It's my greatest aspiration, a bimbo.
Dreams.

627
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,161
Whoa.

628
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,047
So...
Uh-oh.

629
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,968
- Yes.
Ha-ha-ha.

630
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,282
So you're a writer?

631
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,684
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

632
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,770
So you write, like, books?

633
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,441
I've written a few, sure.
Sure, yeah.

634
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,207
Wow.
I've never met a writer before.

635
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,086
No?
You must be really smart.

636
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:07,131
You know, I can't even write my own
name sometimes when I'm tired.

637
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,124
Aw. What kind of books
do you like, huh?

638
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,604
Well, I like stories
with a meaning behind it.

639
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,724
Like a really beautiful love story.
Oh, sure, yeah.

640
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,891
You know, I read this book once,
uh, <i>Romeo and...</i>

641
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,371
<i>Juliet.</i>

642
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,684
Right?
Yeah.

643
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,126
Oh, yeah.
Wow. You know it.

644
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,961
It's very good. It's a play, actually.
It's not a book, a play.

645
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,407
I thought it was a book
based on the movie.

646
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,642
Ha-ha-ha.
No. No, a play. Yeah.

647
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,525
- Okay, it was a play. Wow.
Ha-ha-ha.

648
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,650
Well, I didn't read the whole thing
because sometimes

649
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,326
I have to keep up
and read those magazines

650
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,205
to know what's going on
in those people's lives.

651
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,768
Well, that is important.
Okay, well, you're very, very smart.

652
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,329
And I bet you have a gigantic penis.

653
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,929
Why am I finding myself
so attracted to this woman?

654
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,488
For real! And
that's the funny part of it.

655
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:06,321
The not-so-funny part
of the closet macho, okay,

656
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,844
is today, after we dropped Henry off,
he tells me even though I have an offer

657
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,844
for an amazing job,
he wants me to move to Chicago.

658
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,370
That's not what I said. I missed him.
So we can babysit for his ex-wife.

659
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,488
- I thought I was in a...
- Hey, stop it.

660
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,041
It must have been hard
saying goodbye to Hank.

661
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,607
- Yeah, of course.
- He's such an amazing kid.

662
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,889
Tell him I miss my chess partner.
I will.

663
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,283
When Stefanos and I split up,
I'm getting full custody.

664
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,647
Oh. That's okay for a while

665
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,969
because me and my 20-year-old girlfriend
will be a little bit preoccupied.

666
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,322
- I love men.
- And I love you.

667
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,561
Aw...

668
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,648
Okay, I have a story
that my husband here loves.

669
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:53,970
Gonna tell you everything you need
to know about masculine and feminine.

670
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,247
Okay.
Okay, ready?

671
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,125
Yeah.
My mom used to be a nurse,

672
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,767
so she was there when people
were coming out of their coma.

673
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,689
Oh, that story. I'm listening.
Listen.

674
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,287
It's an interesting story.
I'm listening.

675
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,450
So she was the one to tell them:

676
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:14,089
"Hi. My name's Katerina.
You're coming out of a coma."

677
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,882
"You've been in a really bad
automobile accident,

678
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,401
but you're gonna be okay."

679
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,606
"You're gonna be fine."
You know, stuff like that.

680
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,361
She said that every woman,
the very first thing,

681
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,531
the first reaction she would have,
would be to ask about everyone else.

682
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,411
"How are my kids?
How's my husband?"

683
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,525
"Is anyone else hurt?"

684
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:43,090
Every man, with no exception,
when they were told this,

685
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,045
what was the first thing they did?

686
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,480
Look down at their cock.

687
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,610
You know what? You gotta
make sure it's still there.

688
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,888
You gotta make sure
it's still working.

689
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,048
Alive and kicking.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

690
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:02,087
And only eventually they'd come
around to asking about their kids

691
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,409
or about someone else
they might've accidentally killed.

692
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,681
Stuff like that.

693
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,282
Doesn't that say it all? Penis
first, then the rest of the world.

694
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,041
<i>Penis, penis, penis...</i>

695
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,730
Okay, okay. Whoa, whoa.

696
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,924
But if you can explain it all
on strictly gender terms,

697
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:20,642
why do you, or why does any
woman, waste time getting mad at

698
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:25,050
or bother trying to change a man?
If it's all biology, what is the problem?

699
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,720
And you're so good
at turning things around.

700
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,681
No, I mean, like, he's a genius.
It's like getting pissed at a frog

701
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,042
for being green.
Yes. Exactly.

702
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,768
Hearing all this, I wonder if this idea
of love affair that lasts forever

703
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,405
is still relevant to us.

704
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,122
I mean, we know that we are going
to break up eventually.

705
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,926
Definitely.
Are your parents still together?

706
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,849
- No way.
- No? And what about you?

707
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,930
- They are. But they could be divorced.
- They could be.

708
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:55,607
I think if they had more money,
they wouldn't still be together.

709
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:00,328
God, you guys are so practical.
I was born into the wrong generation.

710
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,842
My grandmother's mother
wrote to our whole family

711
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,970
a 26-page letter from her deathbed.

712
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,642
And she spent three pages
on the costumes she did for a play

713
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,963
and one paragraph on her husband.
She an actress too?

714
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,527
No, she was a, um...
She was a...

715
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,170
- Seamstress. A seamstress.
- Seamstress.

716
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,647
And she had
all these wonderful friends.

717
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:27,811
And about my great-grandfather,
she mentioned three events.

718
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,447
He went to the war, we moved
because of his job, and he died.

719
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,680
Her big advice was to not to be
too consumed with romantic love.

720
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,930
Friendships and work, she said,
brought her the most happiness.

721
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,565
I couldn't agree more.

722
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,127
I mean,
that's the thing that fucks us up.

723
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:50,564
This idea of a soul mate, of someone
who will come to complete us

724
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,128
and save us from
having to take care of ourselves.

725
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,641
With Stefanos,
I set the bar extremely low.

726
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,008
I know he's not gonna meet
any of my needs.

727
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,531
Definitely not.

728
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,728
What about Grandma?
Was she soul mate?

729
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,209
Well, sounds appealing, but actually your
grandmother was more rational than that.

730
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,210
She took care of herself
and asked me to do the same.

731
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,727
We had plenty of room
to meet in the middle.

732
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,810
Yeah. That sounds ideal.
That is, actually. it is.

733
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,571
But it must be obvious
my wife is not here today.

734
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,560
We were never one person. Always two.
We preferred it that way.

735
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,088
That's so beautiful.

736
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:30,365
I think my husband is always trying
to almost colonize me, you know?

737
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,690
I colonize you?

738
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,005
Yes, but I colonize you too, darling.
Oh. Okay.

739
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,804
But at the end of the day,

740
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:44,609
it's not the love of one other person
that matters, it's the love of life.

741
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,531
That's good to know,
because life, I can handle.

742
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:51,520
Ariadni, on the other hand. we all
know the Greeks invented tragedy.

743
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,451
And on top of that,
she's from the region of Mani,

744
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,563
which is short for maniac.

745
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,921
Ask them about the hotel.

746
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,727
If we can't make that hotel room tonight,
could you get a refund or use it yourself?

747
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,527
No, we don't get a refund, man.
Are you trying to get out of it?

748
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,769
It's such a great gift,
but I'm so stressed

749
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,128
- getting all the packing ready...
- No.

750
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,563
We made a deal, guys. We watch the kids.
You're gonna love it.

751
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,808
We're gonna watch yours.
Really good.

752
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,607
It's a fantastic walk to the hotel.
And you want to grab it.

753
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,087
And we'll be very offended
if you don't go.

754
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,123
Okay. Thank you.

755
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,203
Mm.
You're going.

756
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,968
Well, when I think of Elias,

757
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,925
what I miss the most about him

758
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:42,408
is the way he used to lie down
next to me at night.

759
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:46,650
Sometimes his arm would stretch
along my chest.

760
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:52,131
And I couldn't move.
I even held my breath.

761
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,402
But I felt safe.

762
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,249
Complete.

763
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:02,768
And I miss the way he was whistling
walking down the street.

764
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,169
And every time I do something,
I think of what he would say:

765
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,682
"It's cold today. Wear a scarf." Heh.

766
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:16,087
But lately,
I've been forgetting little things.

767
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:21,207
He's sort of fading
and I'm starting to forget him,

768
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:26,446
and it's like losing him again.

769
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:32,522
So sometimes, I make myself
remember every detail of his face.

770
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:37,009
The exact color of his eyes,
his lips, his teeth,

771
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,602
the texture of his skin, his hair.

772
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:44,569
That was all gone by the time he went.

773
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,845
And sometimes... Not always.

774
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,650
But sometimes

775
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,968
I can actually see him.

776
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,970
It's as if a cloud moves away
and there he is.

777
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,650
I could almost touch him.

778
00:45:55,840 --> 00:46:02,041
But then the real world rushes in,
and he vanishes again.

779
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,480
For a while,
I did this every morning

780
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,967
when the sun
was not too bright outside.

781
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:11,886
The sun somehow makes him vanish.

782
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:19,011
Yes, he appears and he disappears,
like a sunrise or sunset.

783
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,443
Anything so ephemeral.

784
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,324
Eh, just like our life. Hm?

785
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:30,206
We appear and we disappear.

786
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,609
And we are so important to some,

787
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:38,448
but we are just passing through.

788
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,604
To passing through.
To passing through.

789
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,201
- To passing through.
- To passing through.

790
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,607
And eventually he catches his
face in the window's reflection.

791
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,280
He realizes he's no longer
a 9-year-old boy.

792
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,484
He's suddenly old. He's got
a beard, his eyes are watery.

793
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,321
This one seems sad. I thought you
were gonna tell me about the guy

794
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,887
that has an imaginary friend.
Which one?

795
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,241
When he's in his 50's,

796
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,920
imaginary friend shows up again.
Hummingbird?

797
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,805
That one. It's funny.
Yeah. You like that one? Oh.

798
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,731
Remember that letter
that you let me read

799
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,685
that you wrote when you were 20
to yourself at 40?

800
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,327
I remember."Dear 40-year-old
Jesse, I hope you're not divorced."

801
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:32,366
I didn't remember that part. I meant
all the other things in that letter.

802
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,641
You're the same guy.

803
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:37,401
We always think we're evolving,
but we can't change that much.

804
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:40,040
Know how I think I've changed the most?
How?

805
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,885
When I was younger,
I just wanted time to speed up.

806
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,849
Why?
So I could be on my own,

807
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,646
be freed from parents, school,
all that shit.

808
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:51,009
I just wanted to close my eyes
and wake up and be an adult.

809
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,204
Now I feel that happened, and I
just want everything to slow down.

810
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:58,285
Mm. I've always had this feeling
no matter where I am in my life

811
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:02,161
that it's either a memory or a dream.
You've always thought that.

812
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,564
Me too. Like, is this really my life?
Like, is it happening right now?

813
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,524
It is. Ha-ha-ha.
I know. Heh, heh.

814
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,281
Every year, I seem to get a bit
more humbled and more overwhelmed

815
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,165
about things I'm never gonna
know or understand.

816
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,807
I keep telling you, you know nothing.
I know. I'm coming around.

817
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,724
But not knowing is not so bad.

818
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:26,091
I mean, the point is to be looking,
searching, to stay hungry, right?

819
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,851
It's true.
I just wish it was a little easier.

820
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,326
How do you mean?

821
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,410
Just to maintain a certain level
of passion, you know?

822
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,887
I mean,
it used to come so naturally.

823
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,801
I remember when I was younger, me and
all my writer friends, we, like...

824
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,482
It felt like we were doing something
important. This was our time.

825
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,047
But you were all arrogant
little pricks.

826
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,089
Heh. No. Well... All right, maybe.
Ha-ha-ha.

827
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:51,802
I don't know. It grew out
of all this energy and this creativity

828
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,002
or whatever ambitions people had.

829
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:58,131
I think you gotta be a little deluded
to stay motivated.

830
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:01,369
Young men have this thing
about comparing themselves.

831
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:04,689
They have all these signposts
they judge themself by.

832
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,207
You used to do that all the time.
Do what?

833
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,880
It was like, uh,
"Rimbaud wrote this by 17."

834
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:14,329
Oh, yeah, definitely. Balzac wrote a book
before breakfast, so what am I doing?

835
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,524
Women don't think that way as much.
You don't think so?

836
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,491
No. We have much less
to compare ourselves to maybe.

837
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:25,089
Women who achieve anything, first time you
hear about them, they're in their 50s.

838
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,443
It was so hard for them
to get any recognitions before then.

839
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,849
They struggled for 30 years
or they raised kids

840
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:35,886
and were stranded at home before they
could finally do what they want.

841
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:40,125
Actually, you know, it's kind of freeing.
We don't have to spend our lives

842
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,248
comparing ourselves
to Martin Luther King,

843
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,890
Ha-ha-ha.
Gandhi, Tolstoy.

844
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,690
What about Joan of Arc, right?

845
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,889
I mean, she was a teenager,
and she saved France, so...

846
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,447
Who wants to be Joan of Arc?
Forget France.

847
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:54,007
She was burned at the stake
and a virgin, okay?

848
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,401
Ha-ha-ha. Okay.
Nothing I aspire to.

849
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,410
What a great achievement.
Ha-ha-ha.

850
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,410
Oh, God.
What?

851
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:03,841
No, nothing.

852
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:07,408
What?
This is so weird. Ha, ha.

853
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,882
What do you mean?
Just this.

854
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,970
Us, walking,
having a conversation

855
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,925
about something else
than scheduling, food, work.

856
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:19,920
Yeah, how long's it been since we
just wandered around bullshitting?

857
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,888
Do you hear what I hear?

858
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,403
The sea?
No.

859
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,763
What? Oh, no small feet.
Mm-hm.

860
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,043
No... Nothing being knocked over,
nothing we have to clean up,

861
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,049
no injustices being done.

862
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,562
Yeah. So when was the last time?
Mm.

863
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,810
When we had nowhere we had to be?
Yeah.

864
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,727
Remember Luxembourg Gardens?
Yeah.

865
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,764
Used to kick your ass at Ping-Pong?
Congratulations.

866
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,843
You beat a woman pregnant
with twins.

867
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,890
It's better than losing
to a pregnant woman with twins.

868
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,407
Okay? Heh, heh.
Oh, God.

869
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,925
You know what I think?

870
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:00,051
From the time we leave our
parents' house until we have kids.

871
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:03,124
That's the only time your life
is completely your own.

872
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,607
I had about a decade of that.
It was great.

873
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,007
It was just like one long flowing...

874
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,049
A day, a week, a year.

875
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,403
There wasn't much difference.
I used to keep track of time.

876
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:17,565
Through jobs, boyfriends, stuff like that.
Now I can tell you every detail

877
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,446
of the past seven years based on what
was happening in the girls' lives.

878
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:22,641
Yeah, right. Totally.

879
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,689
You do that too?

880
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,685
Yeah. I mean, time's demarcated now.
Really?

881
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,444
What?
No, no, no. No, I just...

882
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:33,281
I'm surprised. I'm surprised you do that.
No, but... Okay, quick test.

883
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,761
Oh, no.
You know, August, 2009.

884
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:39,083
No, August... Come on. It's a quick one.
Why?

885
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,243
What was happening?
August...

886
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,402
We were on vacation
with your parents.

887
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:46,643
Nina got the chicken pox first,
quickly followed by Ella.

888
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,764
I'm so impressed.
So do I get a gold star?

889
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,923
Maybe.
Mm-hm.

890
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:55,366
Hey, can I ask you a question?
Sure.

891
00:51:55,560 --> 00:52:00,043
If we were meeting for the first time today
on a train, would you find me attractive?

892
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,050
Of course.
No, but really, right now, as I am?

893
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,481
Would you start talking to me?

894
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:08,246
Would you ask me
to get off the train with you?

895
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,650
Well, I mean, you're asking
a theoretical question.

896
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:16,561
What would my life situation be?
Wouldn't I be cheating on you?

897
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,603
Why can't you just say yes?
I did.

898
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,770
I wanted you to say something
romantic and you blew it.

899
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:24,930
Okay, all right, wait,
if I saw you on a train,

900
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,686
I would lock eyes with you, walk up to you
Uh-huh.

901
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,126
And say, "Hey, baby."

902
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,204
"You are making me as horny
as a billy goat in a pepper patch."

903
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,886
Aah! Stop it! That's disgusting!

904
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:39,290
Billy goat? No. The truth is,
okay, you failed the test.

905
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:42,051
The fact is, you would not
pick me up on a train.

906
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,720
Would not notice
a fat-assed middle-aged mom

907
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,924
losing her hair.
Okay. Losing... Ha-ha-ha.

908
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,127
Yeah, that's me.

909
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:51,607
You set me up to fail on this one.

910
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,167
Okay, true, true, true.
You did. All right.

911
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,769
But in the real world, baldy, okay,
on game day when it mattered,

912
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,284
I did talk to you on a train, okay?
I did. It was the best thing I ever did.

913
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,209
Really? Look at the goats.
Hey.

914
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,243
- Hello.
- Yeah.

915
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:12,285
But, heh, you know,
that's not even a good question.

916
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,724
The real question would be,
if I did ask you to get off a train,

917
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,883
Yeah?
Would you get off with me?

918
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,367
Of course not.
I have people waiting for me.

919
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:26,282
You know, and, heh, heh,
a 41-year-old horny billy goat.

920
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:30,121
How creepy. I'm creeped out
right now. Help!

921
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,288
I can't believe I'm 41.

922
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,841
Yeah, me neither. You've gotten so old.
Heh.

923
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,441
I never thought I'd sleep
with anyone over 40.

924
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:40,405
Actually, you're the oldest guy
I've ever slept with.

925
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,922
That's something. I'm not the
oldest guy you've ever blown.

926
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,451
What?

927
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:48,166
That conference in Warsaw.

928
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,721
What conference?
Lech Walesa.

929
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,524
Lech Walesa?

930
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,762
Oh, what are you talking about?
It's okay.

931
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,930
It was before we were together.
It's... You can admit it.

932
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:02,409
I can remember the way you talked
about how he opened your heart.

933
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:06,286
You definitely blew him. Definitely.
Oh, okay. You're really crazy.

934
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,802
That was Gorbachev, okay,
you geographically-challenged,

935
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,527
football-obsessed, doughnut-loving
American. That was Gorbachev.

936
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,768
I got my Eastern bloc leaders
mixed up.

937
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,121
And I didn't blow him

938
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,971
at all. Okay? Take it back.
Okay, okay, okay.

939
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,730
God.

940
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,848
So was it Václav Havel?

941
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,281
All right, you know...
Heh, heh.

942
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,291
Listen to this. I was gonna wait
to tell you this

943
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,330
till later, but I'm so bad
with secrets.

944
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,682
You have a tumor
in your brain? Gonna die?

945
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,201
No, no, no.
Nothing like that. All right?

946
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,887
Well, actually,
it's kind of like that. Um...

947
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,166
My grandmother died.

948
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:47,569
What? When?
Yeah. My dad texted me before we ate.

949
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,802
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Why didn't you tell me?

950
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:53,681
Everybody's been expecting it. She
lived a long time, had a great life.

951
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:55,524
She was 96.

952
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,365
Hm. Didn't live much longer
after your grandfather died?

953
00:54:58,560 --> 00:54:59,721
Barely a year.

954
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:03,441
I mean, the funny thing is, this
woman was a freaking saint. Okay?

955
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,604
She was a nurse in the war.
She took care of all of us.

956
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,849
I mean, she never said an
unkind word about anybody.

957
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,849
I wish I'd met her.
It's okay.

958
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:16,011
It's okay. By the end, she just really
wasn't into meeting new people.

959
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,602
I mean, after a lifetime
of being sweet as pie,

960
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,610
once Grandpa died,
she got kind of ornery.

961
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:23,841
It happens.

962
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,047
She was in mourning, no?

963
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,966
Well, my dad said
she was just waiting to die.

964
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:32,130
How long were they married?
Seventy-four years.

965
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:35,767
Fuck. How is that even possible?
Ha-ha-ha.

966
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,246
I know.

967
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,284
How old will we be
if we are together 74 years?

968
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,404
Um, when would we start
counting from?

969
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:47,730
I guess from the first time we had sex.
Okay. Yeah, good.

970
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:51,003
Okay.
So, um, 1994.

971
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,810
Okay, '94.

972
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:59,165
Fifty-six years from now.
Yeah. We will be 98.

973
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,526
Oh!

974
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:05,169
Will you be able to put up with
me for another 56 more years?

975
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:08,125
I don't know if I'm gonna be able
to put up with you.

976
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,886
It's crazy if you think about
the change they saw.

977
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,486
When they met,
neither of them had electricity.

978
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,887
He used to take her to school
on his horse.

979
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,366
So romantic.
I know.

980
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,967
He was Valedictorian
and she was salutatorian.

981
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,207
What is that?

982
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,488
Um, he was top of the class.
She was second.

983
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:27,326
She got a couple answers wrong to
make sure he didn't feel threatened.

984
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:31,121
If she wanted to get laid, she better have.
Yeah, like you know who.

985
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:36,770
All right. Anyway, so I called my dad after I
got the text, just to tell him I was sorry,

986
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,485
but I think I screwed up.

987
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,251
At some point I told him,
"You're an orphan now."

988
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,761
You know, and he didn't think
that was funny.

989
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:46,440
No, it's not funny at all.
Yeah, I guess not. Heh, heh.

990
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,204
He's next, then you.
I know.

991
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,041
Well, he told me that my grandparents
wanna have a joint service.

992
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:56,046
Right? They wanna have their ashes
intermingled and be buried as one.

993
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,009
Grandfather didn't have a funeral?

994
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,731
They vowed never to attend
one another's funeral.

995
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,086
Oh, yeah.

996
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:05,050
I kind of like the idea
of you attending mine.

997
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:06,447
Heh. What?
No, I know.

998
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,246
What?
I... You know, imagining you in a suit,

999
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:12,927
clean-shaven for once,
holding hands with the girls. I like it.

1000
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,451
You're gonna outlive me.

1001
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,564
Well, we'll see.
Or I guess, one of us will see.

1002
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:21,327
Heh. Well, you think you wanna
go to the service with me?

1003
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,729
To Texas?
Uh, it's not gonna be in Paris.

1004
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,962
Okay. How bad
do you want me there?

1005
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,640
I'd come, but it's expensive
with the flights.

1006
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,280
Truth is, it'd be simpler to go alone.

1007
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,164
Oh, hello.
Yeah, hello, buddy.

1008
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:37,887
And if I'm not there, it'll be easier
for you to fuck your cousins.

1009
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,320
Yes, that's true. Ha, ha.
Yeah.

1010
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,847
Isn't that common
where you come from?

1011
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,566
You didn't answer the question.
What question?

1012
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:48,651
Well, will you be able to put up
with me for another 56 more years?

1013
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,365
I am looking forward to it.

1014
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,562
Shit, you're really working it.
Mm-hm.

1015
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:57,089
The nectar of
your sex ages like a fine wine.

1016
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,487
Uh-oh.
My hairy Spanish lover is back.

1017
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,126
Greek. I'm Greek now.
Oh, you're Greek now.

1018
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,129
Look at this.

1019
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:08,571
Wow. This place reminds me of a
movie I saw when I was a teenager.

1020
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,366
It was a black-and-white film
from the '50s.

1021
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,603
I remember a couple walking
through the ruins of Pompeii

1022
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,406
looking at bodies
lying there for centuries.

1023
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:20,080
I remember the bodies,
caught in their sleep,

1024
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,806
still lovingly holding each other.

1025
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,443
I don't know why. Sometimes
I have this image in my mind

1026
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,120
when, you know, we're asleep
and you hold me.

1027
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:33,120
Of being buried alive under molten ash?
That's what you're thinking about?

1028
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:35,084
Ha-ha-ha.
That's not very fun.

1029
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,886
Well, I don't know.
It's not horrible.

1030
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:41,123
They had bodies with little kids
sleeping between them.

1031
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,526
Oh, that's nice.
Yeah.

1032
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,370
I was young and a bit morbid.

1033
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:47,603
You romanticize the idea of dying
with the person you love.

1034
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,364
Right? You wanna die with me?

1035
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,881
Maybe. You know, if we were...

1036
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:55,607
You know, our first night
together then, a long time ago,

1037
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,529
but now, no, I'd like to live.

1038
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:00,405
I wanted you to say something romantic.
You blew it.

1039
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:01,641
Oh, no.

1040
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,970
I blew it. Okay, if we're both
98, you can ask me again.

1041
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,605
But anytime sooner...

1042
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,525
Sorry.
Hey.

1043
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:15,127
This is the chapel I was telling
you about from the Byzantine era.

1044
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:17,129
It's 1000 years old.
Can we go in?

1045
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,527
Yeah, I think so.
Okay.

1046
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:21,609
Check this out.

1047
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,246
Hello? Yeah.
Wow.

1048
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:29,524
It's a shrine to Saint Odilia,
the patron saint to eyesight.

1049
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,968
People come from all over,
leave dedications to the blind

1050
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:35,441
to help restore sight.
Hm.

1051
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,051
I'm sure it works.

1052
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,964
Hey, these paintings here,

1053
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:43,609
they make me think of those Japanese
monks, you know, impermanence.

1054
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:46,007
They paint with water
on rock on a hot day.

1055
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,606
By the time they're done,
it's evaporated.

1056
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:51,851
Eyes are scratched out.
Is that about the blindness?

1057
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:54,646
No, I thought that too,
but the caretaker guy,

1058
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:58,162
he told me that the Turks did that
during the occupation.

1059
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:01,970
That's it.
I'm never eating Turkish food again.

1060
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:06,370
Heh, heh. Okay, that'll send a shiver
through the international community.

1061
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,847
Okay, fine. Then I'll never suck
another Turkish cock.

1062
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:12,567
Heh. Okay, that's
gonna have a global impact.

1063
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:14,205
Oh, that's terrible.

1064
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:18,610
I forgot you're a closet Christian. Is it bad
to make blow-job jokes in church?

1065
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:22,361
Shh. It kind of is, okay?
We've done worse.

1066
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:32,371
The girls asked me again
what our wedding was like.

1067
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,965
Yeah? What did you say?

1068
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,970
I say it was, uh, very low key.
Yeah.

1069
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,561
Very low key.
So low key we don't remember it.

1070
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,125
Very Quaker.
Mm-hm.

1071
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:45,490
I don't know why they want us to be
married so badly. It's important to them.

1072
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:48,650
We're in a church. Wanna get married?
No.

1073
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:52,441
It's just all those fairy tales
they like so much, you know?

1074
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,921
Heh, heh.
Remember when they were little

1075
01:00:55,120 --> 01:01:00,126
and at the end of every cartoon,
they'd be like, "They're getting married,"

1076
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:04,120
even if it was Pinocchio and his dad,
Donald Duck and his nephews.

1077
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,167
If we're gonna spend
56 more years together,

1078
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,249
Yeah?
What about me would you change?

1079
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,968
What?
One of your can't-win questions.

1080
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:20,361
I'm not answering that.
What do you mean?

1081
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:23,251
There's not one thing
you'd like to change about me?

1082
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,607
I'm perfect? Okay.
Okay, actually...

1083
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:28,610
One thing. Uh-huh.
If I could change one thing about you,

1084
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:32,441
it would be for you
to stop trying to change me.

1085
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,449
You're a very skilled manipulator.
Mm-hm.

1086
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:37,962
Well, I am on to you.
I know how you work.

1087
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,083
You think?
I know everything about you.

1088
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:43,045
Let's go through here.
I don't think you do.

1089
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,645
Ha-ha-ha.
No? Okay.

1090
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:47,525
Well, I know you better than I
know anybody else on the planet.

1091
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:50,240
But maybe that's not saying much.
Right now,

1092
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:53,171
What?
This is great. I feel close to you.

1093
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:54,805
Yeah.
But sometimes

1094
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,368
I feel like, uh, you're breathing
helium and I'm breathing oxygen.

1095
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,160
What makes you say that? Huh?

1096
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:03,006
See? I'm trying to connect
Heh, I'm being myself.

1097
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:05,208
And you make a joke.
Ha-ha-ha.

1098
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:07,920
- That's exactly what I'm talking about.
- Come on.

1099
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:10,441
If we're ever gonna truly know
one another,

1100
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:13,928
we'd probably have to get
to know ourselves better first.

1101
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,165
Yeah.

1102
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:20,241
Do you remember this friend of
mine, George, from New York?

1103
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:21,566
No.

1104
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,882
Oh, no, that was before.
What was?

1105
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,401
No, no.
Anyway, he was this friend of mine

1106
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:30,321
that when he found out he had
leukemia and was probably gonna die,

1107
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:33,444
the first thing that came
to his mind was relief.

1108
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:35,051
Relief? At what?
Yeah.

1109
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:39,404
Before he found out he had nine months
to live, he was worried about money.

1110
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:44,401
And now his thought was, "I have enough
money to live nine months. I've made it."

1111
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,045
Oh, okay.
I mean...

1112
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:51,127
He was finally able to enjoy everything
about life, even being stuck in traffic.

1113
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:55,609
He would just enjoy looking at people,
staring at their faces, just little things.

1114
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,529
And then what happened?

1115
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:59,006
What do you mean?

1116
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,043
Well, like, is he still alive?

1117
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,891
No, he died a long time ago.

1118
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:09,168
Last night, I had this dream
where I was reading a book.

1119
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:11,806
Okay. It was a lost classic.
The Rovers.

1120
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,480
The Rovers?
Yeah. Like roving around, wandering.

1121
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:17,166
All these young people.
Is that a real book?

1122
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:21,490
No, but it was great. It was fresh,
funny, experimental, had all this energy.

1123
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:24,968
I love that you read in your dreams.
And they're really good.

1124
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:27,242
I have, like,
major action-hero dreams.

1125
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:32,241
Like I'm flying around like a
superhero, breaking through walls.

1126
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:35,041
And at the end, I have an orgasm.

1127
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:39,731
Well, I'm gonna try to make
your dreams come true, baby.

1128
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,126
Yee.

1129
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,609
Still there.

1130
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:01,529
Still there.

1131
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:14,969
Still there.

1132
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:21,163
Still there.

1133
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,045
Gone.

1134
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,850
I need your credit card.

1135
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:46,644
Oh, I think the room is paid for.

1136
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:49,411
Yeah.
Yes, it is, but the credit card is for...

1137
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:53,361
For all possible outcomes.
Incidentals.

1138
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:54,641
Right. Of course.

1139
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:55,966
Mr. Wallace?
Yeah.

1140
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,367
I am such a fan of these two books.

1141
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,761
My husband gave me your book
on our date

1142
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:04,481
and when your second book came out,
we read it out loud together.

1143
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:05,727
Oh, wow.

1144
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:08,810
Would you please sign them to us?
Of course. Of course.

1145
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,561
I love the artwork on these
Greek editions. It's really nice.

1146
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,881
What are your names?
Make it to Sophia and Pavlos.

1147
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,730
Okay.

1148
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:23,289
How's the Greek translation?

1149
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:32,170
But I'm not sure it's the correct word.
You never read them in English.

1150
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:33,765
Exactly.

1151
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:36,571
That's great.

1152
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:38,000
Could you sign them too?

1153
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:41,325
Me?
Yes, you're the real Madeleine, right?

1154
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,324
Madeleine? Not really.

1155
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:47,444
I mean, people assume it's me,
but it's not me at all.

1156
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,449
He's got a big imagination.

1157
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:53,249
Would you be so kind?
It would mean so much to my husband.

1158
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:58,646
I can't sign a book I didn't write. it...
She'd be happy to.

1159
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:00,604
Okay.
Great. Thank you.

1160
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,689
I'm happy to.

1161
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,250
Uh...

1162
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,641
Thank you.

1163
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:13,082
Okay.
Great. Thank you so much.

1164
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,401
Check it out.

1165
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,602
Wow. This is nice.
Yeah.

1166
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:23,406
Clean, air conditioning.

1167
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:26,206
I love it. Oh, my God.
Isn't it great?

1168
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:32,168
Wow. Oh, wow. A bathtub. My God.

1169
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:34,010
Hey, check this out.

1170
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:38,967
Stefanos and Ariadni got us
a bottle of wine and a couple's massage.

1171
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:41,686
We have to get them a present
before we leave.

1172
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:45,885
We should get something for the kids.
Yeah, I know, for sure.

1173
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:47,041
Wow.

1174
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,049
Oh, I miss the girls.

1175
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:55,531
Mm. I don't.

1176
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:58,087
This is such a nice view.

1177
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:02,166
The only view
that I am interested in...

1178
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:06,245
What? What?
Is right

1179
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:08,369
here.

1180
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:14,124
Yeah. It's this.

1181
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:30,930
What?

1182
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:37,881
It's funny, I never noticed until today,
but all the red in your beard is gone.

1183
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:42,006
It used to be one of the things
that made me fall for you. It's crazy.

1184
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:49,088
It's not gone. It's just white.

1185
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:53,126
You're not gonna tell me that your
love is dependent on pigment, are you?

1186
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:56,563
Huh? No?
No, no, but, you know...

1187
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,961
I see the red
in our girls' eye lashes.

1188
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:03,801
I look at them and it makes me
think of when we met.

1189
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:10,205
Mm.
Know what I'm looking forward to?

1190
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:12,567
Yeah? What?
After, uh...

1191
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:15,240
After? Ha-ha-ha.
You know... Ha-ha.

1192
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:19,123
What?
Is waking up next to you tomorrow.

1193
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:22,170
You mean, without Nina and Ella
jumping on our heads?

1194
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:24,049
Exactly.

1195
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:27,086
I haven't heard you think
in years now.

1196
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:28,884
Think?
Yeah.

1197
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:30,570
Oh.

1198
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:36,487
I used to wake up to that sound
of your eyes opening and closing.

1199
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:40,366
That brain of yours
going <i>2</i> million miles an hour.

1200
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:44,485
I miss it, hearing you think.

1201
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:48,403
When you said you could hear
me think, I thought you could.

1202
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:51,803
But it's just my eyelids.
How dumb and romantic of me.

1203
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,241
Mm. It was my favorite thing.

1204
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:59,121
Mm. I miss thinking too.

1205
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:02,964
No more thinking in the morning,
no more morning sex.

1206
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:05,248
Tomorrow.

1207
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:10,200
I'm looking forward to it so much,
I don't think I will sleep.

1208
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,724
I'm looking forward to right now.

1209
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,280
Okay.

1210
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:22,281
Okay, let's stop talking
so we can fuck,

1211
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:27,441
sleep, wake up, think,
and fuck again.

1212
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,480
Don't answer it.
Ha, ha. No.

1213
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:40,920
Oh, shit, who is it? No.

1214
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,088
Who cares?
Okay.

1215
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,767
I said to call in case of emergency only.
I hope the girls are okay.

1216
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:51,851
Okay.

1217
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:54,321
Oh, it's Henry. Okay.

1218
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:56,488
Hey, sweetie, are you okay?

1219
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:58,769
Are you in London?

1220
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:00,366
Oh.

1221
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,650
Oh, already? Okay.

1222
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:07,971
Oh, no, no, we found it.

1223
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:11,648
We'll mail it tomorrow.
Don't worry. Yeah, yeah.

1224
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:17,723
Yeah. Oh, they miss you too.
I'll kiss them for you.

1225
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,609
Yeah.

1226
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:22,763
Okay, I'll tell him.

1227
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,246
Good luck with your mom.

1228
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:26,920
Yeah. I love you too. Bye.

1229
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,764
Okay.

1230
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,886
Okay.

1231
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:34,488
He's fine. He says he'll call you
from Chicago when he lands.

1232
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:37,331
Why can't I talk to him?
Twice you've done that.

1233
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,602
You could have just
handed me the phone.

1234
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,962
He didn't have time.
They were boarding.

1235
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:43,446
What did he forget?

1236
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:47,201
His science project.
But we'll mail it tomorrow. It'll be fine.

1237
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,482
Shouldn't have said that
about his mom.

1238
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:52,803
What? What did I say?
"Good luck with your mom."

1239
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,207
Heh. Come on.
I didn't mean anything by it.

1240
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:59,530
I know, but it's not good. It reminds him.
And I wish you wouldn't do that.

1241
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:04,123
That's so American to just swipe it under
the carpet and act as if it didn't happen.

1242
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:05,805
Why put it into his head?

1243
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,049
What if he doesn't wanna be
thinking about that right now?

1244
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:12,250
It means nothing.
It means something. It does.

1245
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:14,090
I made a joke the other day

1246
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:18,046
that his mom and I should settle it
in one big mud wrestling contest.

1247
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:20,971
Mud wrestling? You said that?
And he laughed.

1248
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:24,562
He might have more of a sense
of humor than you do. Come on.

1249
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:29,124
You say bad things about his morn,
he hears bad things about himself.

1250
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:33,689
I didn't say anything bad about his mom. I made a joke.
It's on me as it is on her.

1251
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:38,169
I know, I know. It's just,
why conjure it up at all, you know?

1252
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:39,885
I think he's old enough now.

1253
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:43,448
I mean, he knows how bad it is
between his mother and I.

1254
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:47,008
His mom and me. And I didn't do anything.
It's all from her.

1255
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:50,722
Okay, she hates me. Yes,
I fucked her husband a long time ago.

1256
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:52,684
Or should I say he fucked me?

1257
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:54,928
Heh. Yeah, right.
Okay.

1258
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:58,960
Making a joke that his mom and I
don't love each other is not the issue.

1259
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,964
That's not gonna traumatize him.
That already happened.

1260
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:05,124
And now you're trying
to transfer your guilt and blame me.

1261
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:06,327
No, I'm not.

1262
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:11,082
On the contrary, if he can joke about it,
maybe he'll be able to live with it better.

1263
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:16,161
Okay, you're right, as always.
Let's just not talk about it, okay?

1264
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:21,368
Mm-hm. Right. It's nobody's fault if his mom
is a drunk and abusive psychologically.

1265
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,443
Don't say that.

1266
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,887
It makes me sick
that he has to be with her.

1267
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,924
But judges assume
that women have the mother instinct.

1268
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,851
She has the mother instinct of Medea.

1269
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,445
Medea, huh?

1270
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,768
Yeah. After all, it is a Greek myth.

1271
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:37,883
Actually a play by Euripides, but...

1272
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,771
A woman killing her kids
to punish her ex-husband.

1273
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,651
That's what she's doing.
Hurting him to get to you.

1274
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:47,521
No, she's making my life hell
through him, that's what she's doing.

1275
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:52,203
And sometimes you say things
that just go too far.

1276
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:55,165
Stop blaming me
for everything wrong with your wife.

1277
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:59,046
Ex-wife, ex-wife. For a long time.
Okay.

1278
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:02,130
Should have dealt with it.
She wouldn't have hated us.

1279
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,527
Okay, okay, I screwed up.

1280
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,560
I just love this little re-write
you do

1281
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:12,448
that everything that isn't perfect
in our life gets laid at my feet.

1282
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:15,765
And now you're putting this shit
on me about Henry.

1283
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:18,122
What shit?
What are you talking about?

1284
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:23,008
Let me tell you what I'm talking about.
The moving to Chicago, giving up my life.

1285
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:28,884
You mentioned that Henry needs you.
How do you think that makes me feel?

1286
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:31,003
I'm miserable. All right?

1287
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:33,248
How can I take that job now?
Okay.

1288
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:36,364
Tell me. I'll feel too guilty. No, no, no.
Come here.

1289
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:40,042
That's a choice you're making,
to look at it like that. All right?

1290
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:43,323
It is in the nature of women
to be the nurturer.

1291
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:45,449
The what?
The nurturer.

1292
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:48,723
The nurturer?
Okay, I can't even say that fucking word.

1293
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:53,642
I just naturally feel bad about everything.
And you give that look, like it's my fault.

1294
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,684
What look?
The I-forgot-the-science-project look.

1295
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,247
I know you blame me.
I didn't say anything.

1296
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:03,161
No, you didn't say anything.
You didn't have to. It's always my fault.

1297
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,249
Yeah, right.

1298
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:07,482
I read on the fridge at work...

1299
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:10,923
You know those magnet words
that people make sentences with?

1300
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:12,081
Mm-hm.

1301
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:16,564
Someone had put together,
"Women explore for eternity

1302
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,802
in the vast garden of sacrifice."

1303
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:23,804
Wow. That's a sure sign from God.
Yeah.

1304
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,164
That line is so damn true, and it's been
for 10,000 years, but that's enough.

1305
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,289
I don't wanna be one of these women.

1306
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:34,127
Like marriage is important to gays,
or contraception to women rights.

1307
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:38,763
It's the same with giving up my hopes,
with women that had to give up hopes.

1308
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:42,885
I'm not gonna do it. This is bigger
than me. This means more than me.

1309
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:49,731
Wow. Bravo.
The Nobel Committee is taking note.

1310
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:52,884
I'm just... Hold on a second.
I'm gonna alert Sweden.

1311
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:56,527
It must be a full-time job carrying
that much feminine oppression.

1312
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,683
It is.
You suffered so much

1313
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:00,763
growing up in middle-class Paris.

1314
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:04,606
The agony in the trenches of
the Sorbonne in the post-feminist era.

1315
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:06,842
I can't imagine.
You're an asshole.

1316
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:10,523
You know what, sweetie,
when are we moving to Chicago?

1317
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:13,610
I wanna make sure
we are able to find a nice house

1318
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:17,202
and I can sew the drapes
and pick matching bed covers.

1319
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:20,165
This is how you now want
to be spending this evening?

1320
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:22,647
This is what you wanna do?
You started it.

1321
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:26,561
No, you are the one
who will not shut up about it.

1322
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:29,923
But if you wanna talk about it,
really talk about it,

1323
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:34,205
I would prefer to have an
unemotional, rational conversation.

1324
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:36,010
Do you think we could do that?

1325
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:39,044
Here we go, unemotional, rational.

1326
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:42,244
You always play the part
of the one and only rational one.

1327
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:45,961
And I'm the irrational, hysterical,
hormone-crazy one

1328
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:47,605
because I have emotions.

1329
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:50,531
You sit back and speak
from your big perspective,

1330
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:53,166
which means
everything you say is true.

1331
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:54,890
I don't always do anything.

1332
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:58,801
The world is fucked by unemotional,
rational men deciding shit.

1333
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:03,449
Politicians going to war, corporate heads
deciding to wreck the environment.

1334
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:06,530
Cheney, Rumsfeld, very rational men.

1335
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:08,563
Cheney and Rumsfeld,
yeah, okay.

1336
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:11,843
The Final Solution,
very rational thinking behind that.

1337
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,411
Okay. So we're there now?

1338
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:17,047
Us versus the Final Solution?
Okay. Let's do it. All right.

1339
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:19,083
Let me ask you this, all right?

1340
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:22,084
Do you think Henry's life
would be helped

1341
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:24,760
by a more consistent presence
by you and me? Huh?

1342
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,046
Here we go.
No.

1343
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:31,131
You won't drop it, so let's talk.
Let me just ask you one question.

1344
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:33,887
Think Hank's life
would be better served

1345
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:36,202
by consistent presence
from you and me?

1346
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:39,250
Yes, it'd be better if he lived with us.
Okay.

1347
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:42,284
I think his mom
is a fucking alcoholic, hateful cunt

1348
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:46,007
that used the time we were in Paris
and I was giving birth

1349
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:49,722
to legally move Henry out of
New York. Fuck her.

1350
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:52,647
Okay. I agree with you.
Mm-hm.

1351
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:55,724
Okay. Unfortunately,
we cannot go get him out of America,

1352
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:58,566
but we could, if we wanted to,
go to him.

1353
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:01,246
Now, I know it would be
a big move.

1354
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:05,445
But what do you think? ls there any way
that you could be happy in the U.S.?

1355
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:10,288
Is that just out of the realm of possibility?
That you could find a comparable job?

1356
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:11,771
Comparable job?
Yeah.

1357
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,331
Are you kidding?
No.

1358
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,444
Why am I the one that have
to make the compromises?

1359
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:19,007
Don't be so dramatic. Okay?
It should be...

1360
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:21,931
Moving to Chicago
is pretty fucking dramatic for me.

1361
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:26,330
I'm not saying we should move.
I just wanna talk about it.

1362
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:29,251
Can you be my friend
for two seconds so we can talk?

1363
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:30,680
Two seconds.
All right.

1364
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:33,844
Remember that time you were late
to pick the girls up

1365
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:38,841
and you were so stressed out because
they were wondering what happened?

1366
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:41,884
Okay, that is the way
that I feel all the time.

1367
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:46,165
Like I fucked up. I mean, I left him
behind and I just wanna go get him.

1368
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:49,005
You always get like this
when you drop him off.

1369
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:51,168
You're sad, so you start a fight.

1370
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:53,370
He's fine.

1371
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:56,490
He's a great kid, okay?

1372
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:59,251
Truth is, he doesn't need you
the way he used to.

1373
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:03,843
You missed the opportunity to be with him
every day of his childhood. You did.

1374
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:07,681
And you can cry about it,
but he's growing up.

1375
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:12,085
You're a great father in other ways.
You got divorced

1376
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:16,165
like millions of other people.
Was it ideal? No. But...

1377
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:20,401
Listen, if in one month
you still want me to quit my job

1378
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:24,082
and give up everything I've
been working towards, just ask,

1379
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:27,847
but right now
I feel the same way I always have.

1380
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:32,250
I would move to the U.S. if that ex-wife
of yours would give us joint custody.

1381
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:35,125
But every other weekend
amounts to shit.

1382
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:36,964
That's less than
30 days a semester.

1383
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:41,842
I don't think it's worth it for us to change
our entire lives over that kind of time.

1384
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:44,122
I know. You're right. Mm-hm.
Right? Right?

1385
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:46,761
See, I'm being the rational one.

1386
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,880
Oh, it's just such a shitty position,
you know?

1387
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:54,806
Hank didn't do anything, but he's the
one getting kicked in the teeth.

1388
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,441
We all get dragged
through our parents' lives.

1389
01:18:57,640 --> 01:19:00,644
Your marriage would have ended
over something else.

1390
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:03,451
Absolutely.
Or worse, he would've been raised

1391
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,409
by two miserable parents.
Right.

1392
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:10,207
I just really fucked that up.

1393
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:15,962
You mean, you fucked up by moving
to Paris to be with me?

1394
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:20,250
No. That's not what I meant. Stop.
I knew that was gonna cost too much.

1395
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,767
I told you not to do it, okay?
Stop it.

1396
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:28,486
Okay, I moved to New York with you
for two years and gave up everything.

1397
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:31,365
I needed to be home
to give birth to the twins

1398
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:34,530
and I wanted to be with my mother.
You wanted it too.

1399
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:37,160
Yes.
That's the one thing I asked from you.

1400
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:40,330
The one thing, and now you're gonna
blame me forever?

1401
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:44,646
Stop it, will you? Stop it.

1402
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:50,205
If you don't wanna move back
to the States, we won't. End of story.

1403
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,368
I am just trying to find a way

1404
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:55,444
where I could be a more consistent
presence in his life.

1405
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:58,405
And ideally, I'd like to do that
as a family.

1406
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:01,481
"As a family"? Or what?

1407
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,483
What the fuck does that mean?

1408
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:08,885
I feel a passive-aggressive threat
in everything you say.

1409
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:13,802
Either do this or I will resent you
for the rest of our lives.

1410
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,570
You know?

1411
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:17,804
Am I right?

1412
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:22,642
You know what? You know what?
I'm sensing something.

1413
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:27,408
I think the problem is, is that you don't
want me to have a more substantial job.

1414
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:31,002
On some level, you feel threatened
by my achieving anything

1415
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:34,044
that could diminish your status
in our relationship.

1416
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:36,607
My status in our relationship?

1417
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:40,805
I teach two courses a semester
at the fucking American School.

1418
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,765
Okay. Wow, that's really some status.

1419
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:46,440
I don't think it's coincidence
you feel that

1420
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:49,769
at the same time
I have a truly exciting job opportunity.

1421
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:54,084
This whole train of thought
is complete horseshit and you know it.

1422
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:56,847
I have a question for you.

1423
01:20:57,080 --> 01:21:02,120
If we didn't have the girls and all our
crap, would we even still be together?

1424
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:04,049
What?

1425
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:07,369
You are the fucking mayor
of crazy town, do you know that?

1426
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:11,201
You know what I think? You need
to move to Chicago. Henry needs you.

1427
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,971
I stay in Paris with the girls
and take this job.

1428
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:15,525
Why are you doing this?
Huh?

1429
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,410
That is a ridiculous idea.

1430
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:21,884
I'm gonna lose you and the girls? No. Why
do you make everything so difficult?

1431
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:25,641
You're unhappy. You're blaming me
for taking you away from your son.

1432
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:28,491
That is a completely irrational
response

1433
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:31,809
to something I'm just trying
to feel my way through.

1434
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:37,007
Listen, Jesse, we've just
spent the last six weeks here,

1435
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,928
and it's been great.

1436
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:45,082
You've been able to write every day
and the weather's been nice.

1437
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,251
But I didn't wanna come to Greece.
I know.

1438
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:51,171
All right? There could be
a revolution any second.

1439
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:54,489
Oh, God.
People eat a lot of feta and olive oil

1440
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:58,765
and they act all happy, but they
actually talk about how angry they are

1441
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:01,725
and it confuses me. I don't
know what's gonna happen.

1442
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:04,042
Oh-oh-oh. Let me
tell you what's gonna happen.

1443
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:07,323
The same thing
that always happens.

1444
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:09,562
Nothing.

1445
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:13,282
All right. Know what? I have had
absolutely zero time for myself.

1446
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:16,649
I have 10,000 e-mails I have to
answer that I didn't answer.

1447
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:17,966
You think I don't?

1448
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:21,647
I spend all day making dinner
and wiping you and your son's pee

1449
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,842
while you talk to fellow novelists.

1450
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:29,689
Blah, blah, blah, you're a genius. Oh,
blah, blah, blah, no, you're a genius.

1451
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:31,803
Mm-hm.
The second we say goodbye to Henry,

1452
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:34,884
you suggest I give up
my dream job.

1453
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:36,889
Oh, okay, now it's your dream job?

1454
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:40,084
This afternoon
you weren't even sure you wanted it.

1455
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:42,089
Do you ever listen to yourself?

1456
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:46,643
It is my dream job. Just because I have
doubts doesn't mean I don't want it.

1457
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:48,251
Okay.
But why do you care?

1458
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:52,041
You go on your two-hour contemplative
walk under the olive trees.

1459
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:54,527
Socrates. You should get a robe.

1460
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:56,330
Uh-huh. It's an hour.

1461
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:00,047
By the time you leave and by the
time you're with us, two hours.

1462
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:01,441
I could never do that.

1463
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:05,929
You're good at taking care of yourself. I
take care of myself and everything else.

1464
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:08,925
We go, you pack your bag.
I pack everything else.

1465
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:12,482
You would never let me pack
the girls' shit. Never.

1466
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:15,047
There would be no shoes
and dirty underwear.

1467
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,565
Yeah, right, so says you.

1468
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:20,486
No, I'm happy you have time
to contemplate the universe

1469
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:23,246
because I don't.
I barely have time to think.

1470
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:25,522
I work, I babysit,
I work, I babysit.

1471
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:29,566
Could you hold on a second? I just
have to tune up the string section.

1472
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:34,408
You know what? Only time I get to think
now is when I take a shit at the office.

1473
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:37,285
I'm starting to associate thoughts
with the smell of shit.

1474
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:41,764
Ha, ha. Well, that is a good line.
I'm gonna use that in a book someday.

1475
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:44,930
Yeah, I'm sure and that'll be
the best line in the book.

1476
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,690
And by the way, you may never,

1477
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:49,320
ever use me
or anything I say or do

1478
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:53,127
in one of your fucking books again.
That goes for the girls too.

1479
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:56,005
A, you shouldn't have
hooked up with a writer.

1480
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:58,646
B, you weren't in the last book
or the one now.

1481
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:01,451
C, I'm gonna write about
whatever the fuck I want.

1482
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:03,444
As always,
our life works for you.

1483
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:07,048
No, no, no. Don't give me this
put-upon housewife bullshit. Okay?

1484
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:08,366
This is not the '50s.

1485
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:12,525
Sorry to ruin your perfect little
narrative of oppression with the truth,

1486
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:15,929
but I am the one who's at home
dealing with the bullshit.

1487
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,242
You're at work until 6:30.
Six o'clock.

1488
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:22,411
You take the girls to school, I pick them up.
That's fair. That's our deal.

1489
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:28,482
We live in Paris, France, for chrissakes.
And you remind me of it every day.

1490
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:32,401
I have orbited my entire life
around you and you know it. Okay?

1491
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:35,649
Sorry if this summer's vacation...
And it is a vacation.

1492
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:39,487
I've seen you frolic in the sea
and shove salad down your throat.

1493
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:43,850
But it is not indicative of you spending
your life in domestic servitude.

1494
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:47,442
You know what I love about men?
They still believe in magic.

1495
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:50,126
Little fairies around
who pick up their socks,

1496
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:54,484
little fairies unload the dishwasher,
little fairies sunscreen the kids.

1497
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:58,082
Little fairies who make the Greek
salad that you eat like a pig.

1498
01:24:58,320 --> 01:24:59,890
Okay, listen to me. All right?

1499
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:03,004
You are great at taking care of us.
You are.

1500
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:06,801
I mean, you take care of the kids,
you take care of your friends,

1501
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,925
you take care of the world. You were
like that before you were a mom

1502
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:12,810
and now it's only magnified.

1503
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:16,010
But, and I've been telling you this
for years now,

1504
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:19,409
you gotta do a little better job
taking care of yourself.

1505
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:22,046
Okay, stop patronizing me.
All right?

1506
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:26,006
I'm the one at home every day at 6,
not 6:30. I'm reliable.

1507
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:30,524
Have you ever booked a babysitter,
ever, in your entire life? No.

1508
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:34,884
What is the name of their pediatrician?
Stop quizzing me. It's fucking boring.

1509
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:39,011
Yeah, okay. You know what? I'm at
home every night and I make dinner,

1510
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:42,283
give baths and read stories.
Sometimes you're there,

1511
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:46,565
sometimes you're at a university event
or a publicity tour. Okay?

1512
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:49,923
When you get inspired,
you keep on writing.

1513
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:52,970
I get inspired too sometimes,
you know that?

1514
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:55,964
You wanna write? Write.
No, but you remember

1515
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:58,731
I used to sing and play guitar
and write songs?

1516
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:02,328
I'd still like to do it,
but I don't get to. There isn't time.

1517
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:06,445
Okay. Well, first off,
my writing isn't a hobby. All right?

1518
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:09,047
Secondly,
I wish you would find the time.

1519
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:12,369
You somehow find time to complain
about eight hours a day.

1520
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:16,889
I mean,
I love the way you sing. Okay?

1521
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:21,843
I fucked up my whole life
because of the way you sing. All right?

1522
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:25,931
If you took one-eighth
of the energy that you spend

1523
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:28,600
on bitching, whining and worrying...

1524
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:33,488
If you put that energy into playing scales,
you'd be like fucking Django Reinhardt.

1525
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:41,851
Okay. All right.

1526
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:44,247
You forgot your shoes.

1527
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:51,089
Oh, God.

1528
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:52,731
Hey.

1529
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:05,765
You think you're winning?

1530
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:07,846
Few people realize

1531
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:12,170
what it's like for an active or
passionate woman to have a child.

1532
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:15,369
Friends told me, "You'll wanna
throw them out the window."

1533
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:20,282
But I never wanted to hurt them once, but
I thought about ending it for myself.

1534
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,482
I was so confused and you were
always away on a stupid book tour

1535
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:28,326
or because of Henry's custody shit,
and I didn't wanna be a burden.

1536
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:31,086
I know why Sylvia Plath
put her head in a toaster.

1537
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:33,726
It was an oven.
Don't play with words.

1538
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:36,810
You know what I mean.
Toaster, oven, same thing.

1539
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,561
You know how many times I was alone
crying with no clue what to do?

1540
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:44,008
Know the guilt a mother feels
when she doesn't know what to do?

1541
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:47,369
Do you think you have
sole ownership of that feeling?

1542
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:49,966
I don't think you understand.
Okay?

1543
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:53,204
You know what my secret fear is?
With every man?

1544
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:57,405
Is that they all wanna turn me
into a submissive housewife.

1545
01:27:57,560 --> 01:28:00,769
Okay. No one could ever do that.
All right?

1546
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:05,609
I promise. It would be easier
to fit your head into a toaster

1547
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:08,525
than to turn you
into anything submissive.

1548
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:11,730
I don't think I've recovered
since giving birth.

1549
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:14,651
When they were born,
I had no idea what to do.

1550
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:18,731
People expect women
to have this instinct that kicks in

1551
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:20,649
like a female baboon.

1552
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:23,844
But I had no idea how to do anything.

1553
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:27,761
I loved them so much
and I was doing everything wrong.

1554
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:32,568
And you were away so often, calling
me and asking me how my day went,

1555
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:36,481
and I couldn't even say it to you
because I felt so ashamed

1556
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:37,806
to be so clueless.

1557
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:40,008
I think you did great.
No, I didn't.

1558
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:43,647
No, you did. Well, you did
a good job faking it, then.

1559
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:47,529
I just... I remember the only way
I could get them to sleep

1560
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:51,281
was to drag that stupid
double stroller down the stairs

1561
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:54,131
and walk them for hours
in the middle of the night,

1562
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:57,881
all the way to Pigalle and back.
I almost got mugged once.

1563
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:02,483
The only reason why the guy didn't
attack me is that I looked so pathetic.

1564
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:06,287
The only upside of being over 35 is
that you don't get raped as much.

1565
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:09,802
Ha-ha-ha.
I read it. It's true.

1566
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,401
Oh, Jesus.

1567
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:18,527
Once, I remember, I was watching the
twins on a trampoline, you know,

1568
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:20,643
and they looked so beautiful,

1569
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:23,207
and I was happy
because they were happy.

1570
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:26,563
You know,
one of them had this Hula-Hoop

1571
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:29,570
that she was using as a jump rope,
you know,

1572
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:34,010
but then the other one wanted it so they
started fighting over it, you know?

1573
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:36,248
And all of a sudden,
I just saw it all.

1574
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:40,729
You know, all this petty jealously
and selfishness, you know?

1575
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:47,485
And I remember thinking, "Okay, this,
heh, is the natural human state."

1576
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:53,210
You know, just always a little dissatisfied,
perpetually discontented, you know?

1577
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:56,244
I mean, heh, look at us.

1578
01:29:56,440 --> 01:30:00,570
Here we are, we are in, you know,
the Garden of Eden

1579
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:03,286
and we can't stop fighting.

1580
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:06,366
I don't think there's
one natural human state.

1581
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:08,085
The human state is multiple.

1582
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:11,568
If that's what you see when
you're watching the girls play,

1583
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:13,962
that means you're depressed.

1584
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,207
Okay. Maybe I am.

1585
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:21,530
No, but when I see them fight, I see
beautiful energy of going forward,

1586
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:25,002
not letting anyone step on them
or take away what they want.

1587
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:28,090
I like it when they fight.
It gives me hope for them.

1588
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:30,442
You see anger
as a positive emotion.

1589
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:35,328
You know, you only end up hurting
yourself, your work, the kids, me.

1590
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:38,805
And you never get angry?

1591
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,970
When I do,
I don't see it as a positive.

1592
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:45,969
You know something?

1593
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:50,891
The way you write, people
come up to me and think

1594
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:55,608
I make love to some wildcat
Henry Miller type. Ha!

1595
01:30:56,680 --> 01:31:01,049
You like to have sex
the exact same way every time.

1596
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:03,043
Mm. When you got it, you got it.

1597
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:06,130
Kissy, kissy. Tittie, tittie.
Pussy.

1598
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:09,841
I'm a man of simple pleasures.

1599
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:12,646
Yeah, very simple,

1600
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:15,411
and I've been meaning
to tell you that lately. Tsk.

1601
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:19,650
You're no Henry Miller,
on any level.

1602
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:24,330
And you know what? Heh.
This room gives me the creeps.

1603
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:27,729
I was expecting something quaint,
like the real Greece.

1604
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:30,042
Place is real.
What are we doing here?

1605
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:33,881
This is too planned, like we're
supposed to have this great evening.

1606
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:37,084
No room for spontaneity.
It is all gone from our lives.

1607
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:40,090
This is stupid and it's not working.
Obviously.

1608
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:43,648
And I curse Ariadni and that perv
Stefanos for doing this.

1609
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:45,330
Okay. A couple's massage?

1610
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:48,040
What the fuck is that?
That sounds sleazy to me.

1611
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:50,971
We don't have to do it!
Okay?

1612
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:53,401
Come on,
this place isn't so bad.

1613
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:55,329
I like hotel rooms.

1614
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:57,124
I think they're sexy.

1615
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:59,442
Yeah, I know you do...

1616
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,682
Mr. Book-Tour.

1617
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:07,011
Mr. Radisson-Hilton.

1618
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:12,205
And I know that time when you were
doing that reading in Washington,

1619
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:16,883
when your cell phone supposedly
broke that night. How convenient.

1620
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:21,526
Swear on our kids you didn't fuck
that lady from the bookstore. Emily.

1621
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:24,970
Swear to me
you didn't fuck that Emily girl.

1622
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:27,527
And I'm not jealous
because I'm not the type.

1623
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:30,883
But I just wanna know. Okay?
Be a man and admit the truth.

1624
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:35,883
I am giving you my whole life,
okay?

1625
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:38,651
I got nothing larger to give.

1626
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:40,763
I'm not giving it to anybody else.

1627
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:45,648
If you're looking for permission
to disqualify me,

1628
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:47,683
I'm not gonna give it to you.

1629
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:51,327
Okay? I love you,

1630
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:55,601
and I am not in conflict
about it. Okay?

1631
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:58,002
But if what you want
is a laundry list

1632
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:01,522
of things about you that
piss me off, I could give it to you.

1633
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:04,161
Yeah. I want to hear.
Okay. Well, uh,

1634
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:08,848
let's start at number one, okay?
Number one, you're fucking nuts.

1635
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:11,611
All right? You are.
Good luck finding somebody

1636
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:15,247
to put up with your shit for
more than, like, six months. Okay?

1637
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:19,849
But I accept the whole package,
the crazy and the brilliant, all right?

1638
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:24,250
You're not gonna change, I don't want you to.
It's accepting you for being you.

1639
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:29,480
I asked a question. If, while I was carrying
that double stroller down the stairs

1640
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:33,765
and getting ass-raped in Pigalle, you
fucked that little Emily Brontë girl?

1641
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,731
I don't know what Emily.
What are you talking about?

1642
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:39,486
The one that wrote the e-mails
about Dostoevsky?

1643
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:41,842
"Oh, Jesse, you're so right."

1644
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:46,364
"The Grand Commander is the deepest
passage of all of Russian literature."

1645
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:48,369
If you're asking me

1646
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:52,730
if I'm committed to you, the girls
and the life we built together,

1647
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:56,447
the answer is a resounding yes.

1648
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:59,883
So you did fuck her.
Thank you very much.

1649
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:04,961
Do I ask about the time you went to your
old boyfriend after his mother died? No.

1650
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:08,647
Why? Because I know the way that
your fucking French ass works

1651
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:13,164
and I guarantee that you at least blew
that guy, but I also know you love me.

1652
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:16,648
All right? I'm okay with you
being a complicated human being.

1653
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:20,805
I don't wanna live a boring life
where two people own each other,

1654
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,891
where two people are institutionalized
in a box that others created

1655
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:26,127
because that is a bunch

1656
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:29,090
of stifling bullshit!

1657
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:31,966
Oh, God. Well...

1658
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:50,722
You know what's
going on here? It's simple.

1659
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:54,402
I don't think
I love you anymore.

1660
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:10,561
Miss?
I don't wanna talk right now.

1661
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:12,922
Here by yourself
or waiting for somebody?

1662
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:14,730
I'm by myself and happy to be.

1663
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:18,481
I'm an angry person and I hurt my
kids, my work and everyone I love.

1664
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:20,808
Well, just my type-

1665
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,844
Okay. I'm not in the mood.
I came here to be alone.

1666
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:28,204
I've just been checking you out, and I
don't wanna make you uncomfortable,

1667
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:31,768
but you are, by far, the
best-looking woman in this place.

1668
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:34,327
Thank you.
I'd love to buy you a drink,

1669
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:37,000
maybe talk to you,
get to know you a bit.

1670
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:38,611
Are you here on business?

1671
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:42,804
Okay. I see.
You have a boyfriend?

1672
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,240
Not anymore.

1673
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:47,649
Jeez, sorry to hear that.
God, you wanna talk about it?

1674
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:49,605
I don't talk to strangers.

1675
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:51,603
That's the thing,
I'm not a stranger.

1676
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:53,649
No, no, no, we've met before.
Oh.

1677
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:56,682
Summer '94.

1678
01:36:58,640 --> 01:37:01,086
You're mistaking me for someone else.
No.

1679
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:04,001
We even fell in love.
Really?

1680
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:05,924
Mm-hm.

1681
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:09,846
Hm. I vaguely remember
someone sweet and romantic

1682
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:14,250
who made me feel like I wasn't alone.
Someone who had respect for who I was.

1683
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:17,210
That's me. I'm that guy.

1684
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:19,650
I don't think so.
Oh.

1685
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:23,003
See, I know something about
tonight that you don't know.

1686
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:25,000
Really? What is that?

1687
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:27,801
Something important.

1688
01:37:28,120 --> 01:37:33,206
You see, I know because I've actually
already lived through this night.

1689
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:35,846
How?
I'm a time traveler.

1690
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:38,726
Okay.

1691
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:43,642
No, I have a time machine in my room. I've
come to save you, like I said I would.

1692
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:47,686
Save me from what?
From being blinded by the bullshit of life.

1693
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:49,126
It's not bullshit.

1694
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:52,085
I assure you,
that guy you vaguely remember,

1695
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:55,204
the sweet romantic one
that you met on a train?

1696
01:37:56,440 --> 01:37:57,601
That is me.

1697
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:00,123
That's you?
Yeah.

1698
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:03,210
Guess I didn't recognize you.
Hm.

1699
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:05,205
You look like shit.

1700
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:10,122
What can I say? I mean,
it's tough out there in time and space.

1701
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:13,244
You, on the other hand,

1702
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:16,330
are even more beautiful
than I remember.

1703
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:18,446
Bullshit.

1704
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:20,608
Jesse, this is not a game.

1705
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:25,288
You get all cute, you get in my panties.
And next thing I know, I'm in Chicago.

1706
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:27,807
Not gonna make it better
by some pick-up line.

1707
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,924
I'm not trying to pick you up.
No, you misunderstand me.

1708
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:33,930
No, no, no.
I'm only here as a messenger.

1709
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:37,408
I've just traveled all the way
from the future.

1710
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:41,850
I was just with
your 82-year-old self

1711
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:45,567
who gave me a letter
to read to you.

1712
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:47,125
So here I am.

1713
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:49,483
I'm still alive in my 80's?

1714
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:52,490
Oh, yeah.
Mm-hm.

1715
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:54,881
How's my French ass?
Nice.

1716
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:57,048
Okay.
Really nice.

1717
01:38:57,280 --> 01:39:00,921
I don't care about the way I look.
There's more of you to love.

1718
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:03,162
Great.
You want me to read it to you?

1719
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:06,204
Do I have a choice?
Sure. If you're not interested...

1720
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:07,646
No, no, no.

1721
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:11,162
Read it.
Okay. All right. Well, here it is.

1722
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:16,446
"Dear Celine, I am writing to you
from the other side of the woods."

1723
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:20,122
"This letter is lighting a candle that will..."
Okay, stop it.

1724
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:23,847
I would never write this.
"Other side of the woods." What woods?

1725
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:26,202
May I please continue?
Okay.

1726
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:29,324
"I am sending you this young man."

1727
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:30,971
"Yes, young."

1728
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:34,369
"And he will be your escort."

1729
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:38,724
"God knows he has many problems
and has struggled his whole life

1730
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:44,290
connecting and being present,
even with those he loves the most."

1731
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:47,484
"And for that he is deeply sorry."

1732
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:50,443
"But you are his only hope."

1733
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:55,965
"Celine, my advice to you is this."

1734
01:39:56,600 --> 01:39:59,126
"You're entering the best years
of your life."

1735
01:39:59,320 --> 01:40:02,210
"Looking back from where I sit now,

1736
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:06,403
these middle years
are only a little bit more difficult

1737
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:08,324
than when you were 12

1738
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:12,451
and Mathieu and Vanessa
danced all night

1739
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:15,211
to the Bee Gees'
'How Deep Is Your Love."'

1740
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:17,568
"I don't know about that. Anyway."

1741
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:19,922
"Celine, you will be fine."

1742
01:40:20,120 --> 01:40:24,205
"Your girls will grow up to become
examples and icons of feminism."

1743
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:26,249
Nice one.
Yeah.

1744
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:30,126
I just noticed there's a postscript
at the bottom. Looks important.

1745
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:32,322
Maybe I should skip over
some of this.

1746
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:34,284
Yeah, skip away. Please.
Okay.

1747
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:36,164
You sure? Yeah, okay, yeah.

1748
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:37,964
All right.
Boring stuff.

1749
01:40:38,160 --> 01:40:42,802
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, it's like,
blah, blah, blah, financial tips,

1750
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,446
horoscope stuff. Okay, here it is.

1751
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:50,208
"P.S. By the way, the best..." Oh.

1752
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:56,366
"By the way, the best sex of my life
happened one night

1753
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:59,325
in the southern Peloponnese."

1754
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:01,443
"Don't miss it."

1755
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:07,249
"My whole sexual being went
to a new, ground-breaking level."

1756
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:10,364
Ground-breaking. Great.
I don't know what that means.

1757
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:13,291
Okay, Jesse, can you
stop this stupid game?

1758
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:17,327
We're not in one of
your stories. Okay?

1759
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:21,924
Did you hear what I said to you
back in the room? Did you hear me?

1760
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:25,609
Yes, I heard you.

1761
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:28,926
What, that
you don't love me anymore?

1762
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:33,326
I figured you didn't mean it,
but if you did, then, uh...

1763
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:38,169
Oh, fuck it. Know something? You're just
like the little girls and everybody else.

1764
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:40,402
You wanna live inside
some fairy tale.

1765
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:42,762
I'm just trying to
make things better.

1766
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:45,725
I tell you I love you,
I tell you you're beautiful,

1767
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:48,963
I tell you that your ass looks great
when you're 80.

1768
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:50,401
Huh?

1769
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:53,769
I'm trying to make you laugh.
Okay.

1770
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,209
All right, I put up
with plenty of your shit.

1771
01:41:57,560 --> 01:42:01,770
And if you think I'm just some dog who's
gonna keep coming back, you're wrong.

1772
01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:05,851
But if you want true love,
then this is it.

1773
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:08,884
This is real life.
It's not perfect, but it's real.

1774
01:42:09,080 --> 01:42:13,210
And if you can't see it, then you're
blind, all right, and I give up.

1775
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:24,047
Oh, God.

1776
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:53,806
So, what about
this time machine?

1777
01:42:57,040 --> 01:42:58,883
What do you mean?

1778
01:42:59,120 --> 01:43:01,088
How does it work?

1779
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:05,007
Well, it's complicated.

1780
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:11,963
Am I gonna have to
get naked to operate it?

1781
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:15,811
I mean...

1782
01:43:16,040 --> 01:43:19,647
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's actually...
It's been a real issue, you know?

1783
01:43:19,880 --> 01:43:24,408
I mean, I... Clothes, they don't travel well
through the whole space-time continuum.

1784
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:26,125
It's...

1785
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:29,922
Wow. You're so smart.

1786
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:32,128
Ha, ha. Oh, jeez.

1787
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:35,529
Space-time...?
Continuum.

1788
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:39,841
Continuum.
Yeah. Really.

1789
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:43,961
There's something that I've been
thinking about, about your letter.

1790
01:43:44,160 --> 01:43:46,242
Yeah?
You know, you, uh...

1791
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:49,205
You mentioned the southern
Peloponnese?

1792
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:52,643
Yeah, yeah, and we're
in the southern Peloponnese.

1793
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:53,926
Mm-hm.

1794
01:43:54,120 --> 01:43:56,566
Yeah, and do you think
it could be tonight

1795
01:43:56,760 --> 01:43:59,969
that you're still talking about
in your 80's?

1796
01:44:00,240 --> 01:44:01,810
Well...

1797
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:06,647
it must have been one hell
of a night we're about to have.
