1
00:00:43,871 --> 00:00:47,163
Estonian villages were formed in Abkhazia in the second half of the 19th century.

2
00:00:47,163 --> 00:00:50,913
Georgian - Abkhasian war, which started in 1992, altered the peaceful life of the estonian inhabitants.
Most of them decided to return to their historic homeland.

3
00:00:52,631 --> 00:00:58,797
Their villages turned empty, only a few people remained.

4
00:02:03,554 --> 00:02:05,560
Who are you?
- What?

5
00:02:06,998 --> 00:02:08,982
Come outside!

6
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:35,245
I'm asking, who are you?
- Me? Ivo, but who are you?

7
00:02:37,301 --> 00:02:39,978
Are you alone here?
- I am.

8
00:02:44,108 --> 00:02:47,019
Are you russian?
- No, an estonian.

9
00:02:49,148 --> 00:02:53,139
What is an estonian doing here?
 - This is my workshop.

10
00:02:55,614 --> 00:03:00,187
What are these boxes for?
For explosives?

11
00:03:01,008 --> 00:03:04,830
No, for tangerines (mandarynki).

12
00:03:06,255 --> 00:03:08,319
If for tangerines, then it's fine.

13
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:16,631
Okay. Do you have any food?
We are hungry.

14
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:23,095
The food is in the house. There.
- Come, let's go.

15
00:03:35,156 --> 00:03:36,640
Hop in the car.

16
00:03:40,101 --> 00:03:45,773
TANGERINES (mandarynki)

17
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:04,651
Who do you have at home?
- Nobody, I live alone.

18
00:04:35,218 --> 00:04:38,438
Step in, have a seat.

19
00:04:46,821 --> 00:04:52,654
We will sit, grandfather, but pack the food, we are moving on.
- Fine.

20
00:04:56,137 --> 00:04:58,304
And don't be greedy.

21
00:05:10,731 --> 00:05:14,730
Look, what a beautiful girl.
- Yes, a beauty.

22
00:05:19,663 --> 00:05:23,638
Where is your family?
You have nobody?

23
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:28,352
They all went home after the war started.

24
00:05:30,025 --> 00:05:33,531
Where to?
- To Estonia.

25
00:05:36,305 --> 00:05:38,455
And why did you stay?

26
00:05:40,277 --> 00:05:42,489
I didn't want to leave.

27
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,341
Is this your daughter?
- Granddaughter.

28
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:53,051
And don't say anything about her.
Don't even think about it.

29
00:05:54,929 --> 00:06:01,067
I didn't even plan to. Ibrahim.

30
00:06:06,202 --> 00:06:08,880
What's that?

31
00:06:11,145 --> 00:06:13,138
Food.

32
00:06:19,986 --> 00:06:23,857
You are a nice man, grandfather.
Sorry that you are so old.

33
00:06:23,857 --> 00:06:27,111
I'm sorry that brave men like you get old.

34
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:31,474
What is happening out there?
An intense war?

35
00:06:31,782 --> 00:06:34,142
Yes, old man.
You better leave to Estonia.

36
00:06:34,142 --> 00:06:36,654
Not everyone will be as nice as us.

37
00:06:44,713 --> 00:06:48,704
Does anyone live in these houses?
- No, they're all empty.

38
00:06:48,704 --> 00:06:51,893
There is only one guy living near the plantation.

39
00:06:51,893 --> 00:06:55,521
But he only has tangerines (mandarynki).
I'm helping him.

40
00:06:55,521 --> 00:06:57,956
We don't care about tangerines.

41
00:06:59,381 --> 00:07:04,707
But the box-making business you have here is fine.
Well done!

42
00:08:14,072 --> 00:08:15,724
Margus!

43
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,969
Margus!

44
00:08:54,814 --> 00:08:56,000
Yes, wait!

45
00:09:00,013 --> 00:09:04,969
Who were these guys?
Caucasians, they wanted food.

46
00:09:04,969 --> 00:09:07,884
They didn't visit me.
- I know.

47
00:09:07,884 --> 00:09:10,889
Did you get an agreement?
- Yes.

48
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:14,922
They agreed to send on the 7th,
20 soldiers, for one day.

49
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:17,532
In one day we will not make it.
Of course not.

50
00:09:18,061 --> 00:09:21,136
We will pick as much as we can.
I already started.

51
00:09:21,136 --> 00:09:26,194
Very well, if we will continue in the same tempo,
we will never get anything out of the fields.

52
00:09:26,194 --> 00:09:30,598
In a few days there will probably be 
an intensive battle over here.

53
00:09:30,598 --> 00:09:35,413
These caucasians said, that soon there will be war over here.
- My army leader told the same.

54
00:09:35,413 --> 00:09:39,226
I will make 10 boxes today, then there will be a total of 200,
Do you think it will be enough?

55
00:09:39,226 --> 00:09:44,040
Decide yourself. But I think we would need another 50.

56
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,380
Okay.

57
00:09:50,618 --> 00:09:54,587
Don't kill yourself with the work, 
there are still 5 days until the 7th.

58
00:09:55,835 --> 00:09:57,873
The faster, the better.

59
00:10:58,268 --> 00:11:01,213
(The war news from the radio.)

60
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,265
Margus!

61
00:12:35,415 --> 00:12:38,560
Margus!
- Yes.

62
00:12:40,492 --> 00:12:43,471
You didn't get hit?
- No, I didn't.

63
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:46,517
What happened here?
- I don't know.

64
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:51,447
This car was driving in the front, 
the other one was following.

65
00:12:51,447 --> 00:12:55,721
Shot the first car, which hit the fence.
Now my fence is ruined.

66
00:12:55,721 --> 00:12:59,800
I was climbing a tree.
Hiding.

67
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,979
And then I saw someone shooting 
with some kind of a weapon, i think it was a Minomet.

68
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:09,442
We can go nuts here, what was it?

69
00:13:10,534 --> 00:13:13,131
Okay, calm down.

70
00:13:25,693 --> 00:13:32,378
He is wounded, go check what is in the van.
And be careful!

71
00:13:39,168 --> 00:13:41,198
Be calm...

72
00:13:58,524 --> 00:14:01,950
What is there?
- All of them dead.

73
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,871
So georgian dzighits, where are you?
- Calm down.

74
00:14:16,504 --> 00:14:21,069
How are things in heaven, you swines.
- Enough!

75
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:24,400
You shouldn't yell, 
otherwise you might die.

76
00:14:27,671 --> 00:14:30,101
Finally we were able to stop the bleeding.

77
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:33,045
But Ibrahim was killed?
- Start the car.

78
00:14:33,045 --> 00:14:36,317
These bastards killed him, yes?
- Yes.

79
00:14:37,532 --> 00:14:41,525
We are going to bury him now,
but you try to calm down.

80
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:47,669
We are going to invite a doctor for you.
Try to move less.

81
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:52,254
Be careful out there, grandpa,
make sure there is nobody following you.

82
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,124
The georgian bastards might be after you.

83
00:14:56,124 --> 00:14:58,737
Don't you worry, just lay there quietly.

84
00:14:58,737 --> 00:15:04,038
Give me my machine gun.
- Why? There will be nobody coming here.

85
00:15:04,038 --> 00:15:08,131
Give me. Anything could happen.
- I said there will be nobody.

86
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:46,881
Check the pockets,
maybe you will find documents.

87
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:51,994
For what?
Maybe the relatives will start to search for them,

88
00:16:51,994 --> 00:16:54,637
then we can bring them to the grave.

89
00:16:56,532 --> 00:16:58,441
You are right.

90
00:17:08,623 --> 00:17:14,880
These georgians are still boys.
Only this one is older.

91
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,756
Yes, still boys.

92
00:17:20,651 --> 00:17:26,695
You know what?
Let's bury these georgians separately.

93
00:17:26,695 --> 00:17:29,895
And this one with the beard, separately farther here.

94
00:17:29,895 --> 00:17:34,427
Then we will know who is where.
- Okay.

95
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:50,635
This georgian is still alive.

96
00:18:09,537 --> 00:18:11,074
Don't be afraid, it's us.

97
00:18:13,265 --> 00:18:17,583
Who is this? Ibrahim? Still alive?
- No, it's not Ibrahim.

98
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,669
Who then?

99
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:37,001
Bring water in a bowl. 
And a clean towel from the kitchen cupboard.

100
00:19:00,211 --> 00:19:02,836
A piece of a bombshell is in his head.

101
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:07,364
Now we need Juhan,
otherwise he is not going to survive.

102
00:19:08,739 --> 00:19:11,157
The other one also needs a doctor.

103
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:24,979
Go fast and bring Juhan here.
And the van needs to be cleaned up.

104
00:19:24,979 --> 00:19:28,821
It's easier with three of us.
- I have a good rope.

105
00:19:31,314 --> 00:19:33,112
Wait!

106
00:19:37,973 --> 00:19:42,174
Make sure he will keep his mouth shut.
- To whom could he tell? Everyone is gone.

107
00:19:42,174 --> 00:19:45,768
To his wife.
- She is already in Estonia.

108
00:20:02,136 --> 00:20:03,774
How are you?

109
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,742
Hurts?
- It's fine.

110
00:20:11,033 --> 00:20:13,179
Thanks to Allah, already less.

111
00:20:17,779 --> 00:20:19,755
Who did you bring here?

112
00:20:22,796 --> 00:20:25,493
One georgian. He is heavily wounded.

113
00:20:25,493 --> 00:20:29,021
What? Are you crazy?

114
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:32,319
I'm going to kill him anyway.
Your effort was for nothing.

115
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:44,713
Okay, forgive me,
but they killed my friend.

116
00:20:44,713 --> 00:20:48,948
And you didn't kill two of his?
Or can't you count?

117
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:55,394
I should have killed three.
Anyway, I will fix this.

118
00:20:55,394 --> 00:20:59,371
You are nursing him for nothing. In vain.

119
00:21:22,928 --> 00:21:26,929
How is he?
- The chechen will be fine in a week.

120
00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:31,589
But the georgian - I don't know.
Everything depends on his organism.

121
00:21:35,397 --> 00:21:37,876
What will happen to the piece of the bomb?

122
00:21:41,537 --> 00:21:45,978
Make sure that the injections are done at right times.
- Don't worry.

123
00:21:47,065 --> 00:21:50,367
Why is he hallucinating all the time?
- It's good that the is hallucinating.

124
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:53,942
Maybe then he will survive.

125
00:21:53,942 --> 00:21:56,927
I will come back tomorrow, the same time.

126
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:04,739
How was it?
- He ate a bit. Now he fell asleep.

127
00:22:04,739 --> 00:22:11,449
Are we going?
- Wait, I will lock the door to the georgian.

128
00:22:13,836 --> 00:22:17,237
We can not be sure, what the other lunatic might do.

129
00:22:32,261 --> 00:22:34,435
Let's drive.
Sit behind the wheel.

130
00:23:02,538 --> 00:23:06,061
Turn the wheel to the right. To the right!

131
00:23:07,148 --> 00:23:09,219
Very well!

132
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:14,638
Okay - push, push.

133
00:23:31,052 --> 00:23:33,741
I thought it's going to explode.

134
00:23:33,741 --> 00:23:38,510
It explodes in the cinema.
- The cinema is one big cheating.

135
00:24:07,567 --> 00:24:11,494
How are you?
- Not bad.

136
00:24:12,731 --> 00:24:17,085
I finished 20 boxes.
You can take them.

137
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:24,917
These wounded are ruining our business.

138
00:24:26,896 --> 00:24:30,698
So what should I do now?
Kill them?

139
00:24:30,698 --> 00:24:36,029
Well I didn't mean that,
i was just saying.

140
00:24:36,029 --> 00:24:38,236
Don't complain.

141
00:24:47,467 --> 00:24:50,974
How many did you pick?
- All the boxes you brought yesterday are full.

142
00:24:52,465 --> 00:24:55,743
Very good.
Did you visit my place?

143
00:24:55,743 --> 00:24:59,861
Yes, I brought the key.
- Why didn't you leave it under the stairs?

144
00:24:59,861 --> 00:25:04,014
What if someone would find it?
- Who would start looking for the key?

145
00:25:04,014 --> 00:25:07,127
If they want, they will just kick in the door.

146
00:25:10,429 --> 00:25:13,097
How are they?
- Chechen is well.

147
00:25:13,207 --> 00:25:16,606
He ate all the food. Seems that he is healing.

148
00:25:17,735 --> 00:25:19,908
But the georgian?

149
00:25:23,652 --> 00:25:26,825
Did you measure his temperature?
- What's the point.

150
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:29,863
His head is really hot, hallucinating all the time.

151
00:25:31,424 --> 00:25:33,888
Leave the key here.

152
00:25:35,262 --> 00:25:37,319
Should I help you carry the boxes?

153
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:40,805
No need, I'm fine.
Do your work.

154
00:25:41,711 --> 00:25:46,498
I went to check the van.
There is nothing visible from the road.

155
00:27:00,454 --> 00:27:05,910
What were you thinking?
- I will kill him anyway, grandpa.

156
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:13,602
Put him behind a thousand locks, 
I will pay back for my friend.

157
00:27:13,602 --> 00:27:17,470
This is a holy thing for us, you will never understand.

158
00:27:20,684 --> 00:27:22,734
To kill a person who is sleeping,

159
00:27:24,104 --> 00:27:29,097
even if he is unconcious? 
This is holy for you as well?

160
00:27:31,746 --> 00:27:33,819
I didn't know.

161
00:27:34,777 --> 00:27:37,719
I will kill him, when he will start standing again.

162
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:14,168
Soon there will be rain.

163
00:28:16,412 --> 00:28:18,470
There will not.

164
00:28:20,928 --> 00:28:24,135
They will be here soon.
- Who?

165
00:28:26,924 --> 00:28:31,268
The georgians and russians.

166
00:28:34,285 --> 00:28:36,890
And the tangerines will stay in the trees.

167
00:28:37,906 --> 00:28:41,182
You know what this war is called?

168
00:28:41,182 --> 00:28:45,493
The war of citrus.
- What do you mean?

169
00:28:45,493 --> 00:28:48,954
It's a war over my tangerines.

170
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,609
Be normal.

171
00:28:52,881 --> 00:28:57,991
They are fighting for the land.
- For the land where my tangerines grow.

172
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,687
You have gone crazy with your tangerines.

173
00:29:05,341 --> 00:29:10,183
When the tangerines have been sold, 
I will go to Estonia - it is now a free land.

174
00:29:12,993 --> 00:29:15,056
The georgian gained consciousness.

175
00:29:43,663 --> 00:29:45,509
Thank you.

176
00:29:45,509 --> 00:29:47,791
Thank you for everything.

177
00:29:49,277 --> 00:29:50,833
Try to speak less.

178
00:29:52,952 --> 00:29:55,820
I have a horrible headache.
- Don't worry.

179
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:58,830
I'm going to make an injection and you will feel better.

180
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,386
So this pig woke up?

181
00:30:01,386 --> 00:30:07,114
Who is this?
- Don't mind. He is crazy.

182
00:30:15,297 --> 00:30:19,761
I will kill him anyway, grandpa.
- Listen to me!

183
00:30:19,761 --> 00:30:24,454
In my house, nobody will kill anyone,
if I don't want it.

184
00:30:25,605 --> 00:30:31,128
But if you are still planning to do it, 
then you will have to kill me first.

185
00:30:31,128 --> 00:30:37,070
Come on, grandpa. You saved my life.
- You heard, what I said.

186
00:30:38,578 --> 00:30:44,891
Okay. I will give my word, 
that I will not kill him in your house.

187
00:30:44,891 --> 00:30:48,796
But as soon as he will leave, I will do it.

188
00:31:02,421 --> 00:31:04,626
I'm hoping to see you in Estonia.

189
00:31:05,646 --> 00:31:09,315
When are you leaving?
- In the morning there will be a car picking me up.

190
00:31:10,548 --> 00:31:13,253
Be careful.
- Don't worry.

191
00:31:13,253 --> 00:31:16,697
Half an hour to the airport, and from there already home.

192
00:31:17,781 --> 00:31:19,881
God will guide me.

193
00:31:19,952 --> 00:31:22,269
What are you doing here?

194
00:31:22,269 --> 00:31:25,714
Sell the tangerines and come home.

195
00:31:25,714 --> 00:31:30,459
Our previous life has ended.
That's it, the end.

196
00:31:31,449 --> 00:31:34,572
You know very well why I will stay here.

197
00:31:34,572 --> 00:31:37,627
You better think about you granddaughter.

198
00:31:37,627 --> 00:31:42,462
Mari is fine, I'm not worried about her.

199
00:31:42,462 --> 00:31:46,357
Thank you, Juhan.

200
00:31:52,449 --> 00:31:57,127
The medicine is in the drawer. 
I left a note how to administer it.

201
00:32:01,097 --> 00:32:04,531
Be strong.

202
00:33:04,897 --> 00:33:10,545
Already walking?
- I'm feeling better. Got tired of laying.

203
00:33:12,754 --> 00:33:14,949
My clothes fit you.

204
00:33:17,864 --> 00:33:19,919
Take it slowly!

205
00:33:49,498 --> 00:33:51,713
You have to eat a lot.

206
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:57,681
To gain power.
- I don't have an appetite.

207
00:34:11,046 --> 00:34:13,356
I'm telling you, eat!

208
00:34:13,356 --> 00:34:15,617
Do you want tea?
- Yes.

209
00:34:18,081 --> 00:34:20,146
Thanks for saving me.

210
00:34:22,782 --> 00:34:26,326
You're welcome. Eat.

211
00:34:28,453 --> 00:34:32,025
I'm apologizing again for what I said.

212
00:34:32,025 --> 00:34:37,053
I'm angry. But normally we respect older people. A lot.

213
00:34:38,574 --> 00:34:40,366
Apology accepted.

214
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:51,256
Does the wound hurt you?
- Not much.

215
00:35:01,547 --> 00:35:06,294
Where did you bury my friend?
- In the forest.

216
00:35:13,817 --> 00:35:18,611
What's your name?
- Ahmed.

217
00:35:21,999 --> 00:35:25,563
But you don't care about my name?

218
00:35:28,861 --> 00:35:32,096
I care.
- I am Ivo.

219
00:35:33,982 --> 00:35:36,149
I'm a chechen, a fighter.

220
00:35:38,556 --> 00:35:40,885
A mercenary?
- Yes.

221
00:35:44,641 --> 00:35:46,821
It's clear.

222
00:35:50,539 --> 00:35:54,940
Do you have any family?
- I do.

223
00:35:56,744 --> 00:36:01,338
They are the reason why I joined the war.
I'm paid well.

224
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:09,011
You joined the war because of them?
- Don't start preaching me.

225
00:36:09,011 --> 00:36:11,767
I said that I respect old people,

226
00:36:11,767 --> 00:36:15,375
but this is not your business.
Not your business, Ivo.

227
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:19,273
You are right, I'm Ivo.

228
00:36:37,683 --> 00:36:41,802
Ivo...

229
00:36:41,802 --> 00:36:45,933
Where is my gun?
- In a safe place.

230
00:36:45,933 --> 00:36:50,796
When you will be better, I will return it to you.
Also the trophy weapons of the georgians.

231
00:36:50,796 --> 00:36:52,969
These belong to you as well?

232
00:37:03,532 --> 00:37:08,858
I would like to ask you something.
- Then ask.

233
00:37:08,858 --> 00:37:13,566
I have to tell you, that if I will give my word of honor,

234
00:37:13,566 --> 00:37:17,558
then I would rather die than break it.
- Exactly. Me too.

235
00:37:19,373 --> 00:37:22,290
That means I don't have to lock this door anymore?

236
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:24,544
Listen Ivo, you estonian,

237
00:37:24,544 --> 00:37:27,681
would rather die than break the word of honor.

238
00:37:27,681 --> 00:37:33,202
But you are asking me, a caucasian, if I will keep mine?

239
00:37:33,202 --> 00:37:35,469
This means everything for us.

240
00:37:35,469 --> 00:37:39,506
I promised not to kill in your house,
that means, I will not.

241
00:37:39,506 --> 00:37:42,120
Fine.

242
00:37:43,287 --> 00:37:47,499
But estonian or caucasian, there is no difference.

243
00:37:51,493 --> 00:37:57,107
Ivo, why didn't you leave to Estonia?

244
00:37:57,107 --> 00:38:01,338
This is none of your business, young man.

245
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:20,811
Our work will be pointless, 
if there will be no one to help us.

246
00:38:20,811 --> 00:38:26,780
In this time I managed to pick only two boxes.
I'm not able to pick any more.

247
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:30,687
If there will be no help tomorrow, 
then we will burn.

248
00:38:32,371 --> 00:38:34,794
What did the major excactly tell you?

249
00:38:34,794 --> 00:38:38,613
That they are coming, 
if nothing will happen in the meanwhile.

250
00:38:38,613 --> 00:38:40,887
If nothing will happen.

251
00:38:40,887 --> 00:38:44,938
Well if they are not sent elsewhere.
And they will not be sent

252
00:38:44,938 --> 00:38:51,142
They have been guarding the village road for two weeks already,
why should something happen exactly tomorrow.

253
00:38:53,899 --> 00:38:55,934
I don't know.

254
00:38:55,934 --> 00:38:58,244
It would be really weird if,

255
00:38:58,244 --> 00:39:02,322
soldiers would start to pick tangerines in the middle of the war.

256
00:39:02,322 --> 00:39:06,199
You are weird yourself, the major promised.

257
00:39:10,955 --> 00:39:15,087
May the god help us.
I'm hoping too.

258
00:39:16,294 --> 00:39:21,240
Don't you worry Ivo. They will come.

259
00:39:32,764 --> 00:39:35,707
(The war news from the radio.)

260
00:39:39,883 --> 00:39:41,978
Slowly, slowly.

261
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,853
There's no hurry.

262
00:39:54,381 --> 00:39:56,680
Good boy.

263
00:40:00,355 --> 00:40:02,335
Sit down.

264
00:40:08,241 --> 00:40:11,652
How are you feeling yourself?
- My head is spinning a bit.

265
00:40:11,652 --> 00:40:13,811
That's nothing.

266
00:40:16,715 --> 00:40:19,524
We found this from your head.

267
00:40:37,655 --> 00:40:40,512
And these from your pockets.

268
00:40:40,759 --> 00:40:42,425
Do you want tea?
- Yes.

269
00:41:03,154 --> 00:41:07,702
Ahmed, drink your tea,
or it will cool down.

270
00:41:37,387 --> 00:41:44,328
Okay, enemies.
He is Ahmed and he is Nika.

271
00:41:44,328 --> 00:41:47,253
It's a pleasure.

272
00:41:47,253 --> 00:41:52,672
You know georgian. Probably you know already
that there is no reason to be afrait.

273
00:41:54,984 --> 00:41:59,174
I promised to our life-saver that 
I will not kill you in his house.

274
00:42:00,273 --> 00:42:02,788
So if you want to live, don't go outside.

275
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:10,263
Don't even put your head out of the window,
I will chop it off.

276
00:42:19,402 --> 00:42:23,052
But can he piss outside from the window?

277
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,635
Enough!

278
00:42:33,763 --> 00:42:35,652
Enough.

279
00:42:53,451 --> 00:42:55,115
Forgive me, Ivo.

280
00:43:45,027 --> 00:43:47,011
They didn't come, did they?

281
00:43:49,785 --> 00:43:52,289
Do you want tea?

282
00:43:55,112 --> 00:43:58,002
Doesn't matter, these tangerines.

283
00:43:58,724 --> 00:44:04,506
It is stupid to start making business with tangerines
in the middle of the war.

284
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,985
Does he happen to be your relative, by chance?

285
00:44:27,786 --> 00:44:29,418
Margus!

286
00:44:50,314 --> 00:44:52,788
Step in, what are you standing there.

287
00:44:52,788 --> 00:44:57,768
I don't know, I thought that maybe you got offended.

288
00:45:00,053 --> 00:45:03,658
What are you talking about, come in.

289
00:45:05,212 --> 00:45:08,365
Let's sit outside.
It's a nice weather.

290
00:45:09,803 --> 00:45:13,942
I don't want to leave them on their own for too long.

291
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:52,314
Aren't you afraid that they are going to kill each other?

292
00:45:54,363 --> 00:45:56,959
The chechen gave his word of honor.

293
00:45:58,901 --> 00:46:01,949
And you trust him?
- I do.

294
00:46:03,701 --> 00:46:08,361
But the georgian?
- He too.

295
00:46:10,435 --> 00:46:14,741
Well, if it was the word of honor...

296
00:46:15,477 --> 00:46:20,260
Don't be surprised. There are still people who keep their word.

297
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:25,955
And both of them are in your house?

298
00:46:25,955 --> 00:46:29,295
Don't nag.

299
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:35,252
Maybe you want one of them to move to my place?

300
00:46:39,364 --> 00:46:44,461
The battle took place in front of your house,
they ran over your fence.

301
00:46:45,572 --> 00:46:50,443
From your house, from upstairs even the van is visible.

302
00:46:53,339 --> 00:46:58,656
It's safer at my place.
- You're right.

303
00:47:01,607 --> 00:47:04,115
Come to visit me in the evening.

304
00:47:07,025 --> 00:47:10,788
The boys are going to sleep ealry. Let's drink a bit.
- Okay.

305
00:47:12,808 --> 00:47:15,121
So in the evening then.

306
00:47:17,931 --> 00:47:23,375
Don't get angry now... but maybe you will 
come to Estonia together with me?

307
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:28,770
Ivo, maybe we will find another song?
This one is making me crazy.

308
00:48:30,237 --> 00:48:32,681
But I like it. I'm listening.

309
00:49:03,594 --> 00:49:06,839
But what kind of music do you like, georgian?

310
00:49:09,004 --> 00:49:12,867
This one not.
- Georgian music?

311
00:49:15,688 --> 00:49:23,001
I like georgian music.
- And also the land that belongs to Georgia?

312
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:27,238
Where is the Georgian land?
- Here.

313
00:49:27,238 --> 00:49:30,584
This, on what you are sitting,
is the land of Georgia.

314
00:49:30,584 --> 00:49:33,529
You are sitting on Georgian land.
- No.

315
00:49:33,529 --> 00:49:37,340
I'm sitting on an Estonian chair.
- Very funny.

316
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:41,699
Yes, on an estonian chair, which is in an estonian house,

317
00:49:41,699 --> 00:49:44,190
which is standing on the land of Abkhazia.

318
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:49,054
Listen, have you even been to school?
Do you even have schools?

319
00:49:50,044 --> 00:49:52,900
What?
- I'm asking if you even have schools?

320
00:49:54,336 --> 00:49:58,725
What are you smiling, foreigner?
What did you lose in Georgia?

321
00:49:58,725 --> 00:50:03,794
I'm protecting a small nation from foreigners like you.

322
00:50:03,794 --> 00:50:07,235
Seems, that you really don't have any schools.

323
00:50:07,235 --> 00:50:10,977
You don't understand anything.
You don't know anything.

324
00:50:10,977 --> 00:50:14,556
Have you studied history?
Read any books?

325
00:50:16,467 --> 00:50:20,645
I will not take your words to my heart.
I don't care what you are babbling.

326
00:50:20,645 --> 00:50:24,108
Here you are safe, babble as much as you want.

327
00:50:24,108 --> 00:50:28,085
Listen, let's go outside at once.
- You don't even have power to walk.

328
00:50:28,085 --> 00:50:31,923
I could even kill you with a rag,
that would not be very manly.

329
00:50:31,923 --> 00:50:35,644
If you will finally be healthy, then we will see, 
what will happen to you.

330
00:50:35,644 --> 00:50:38,446
You damn bastard!

331
00:50:42,286 --> 00:50:46,283
Don't jump, if your ass doesn't carry you!
You little worm.

332
00:50:49,057 --> 00:50:53,849
Go away from my land, you bastard!
- Im telling you, you idiot,

333
00:50:53,849 --> 00:50:56,154
this is not the land of Georgia!

334
00:50:56,154 --> 00:51:00,708
Go and sleep, you don't have much time left.
- Enough, Ahmed!

335
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:08,058
I'm sorry, Ivo, but tell him as well to keep his mouth shut.

336
00:51:08,058 --> 00:51:10,370
Your mouth will be shut really soon!

337
00:51:15,708 --> 00:51:17,559
Slowly...

338
00:52:03,117 --> 00:52:06,624
Good morning, Ivo!
- Good morning.

339
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:10,449
How are you?
- Getting better.

340
00:52:10,449 --> 00:52:13,181
It's good when you are getting better.

341
00:52:16,447 --> 00:52:18,985
And where is your enemy?
Still sleeping?

342
00:52:18,985 --> 00:52:22,066
No, the enemy is not sleeping.
Good morning.

343
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:25,468
How is your head?
- Almost doesn't hurt anymore.

344
00:52:25,468 --> 00:52:28,730
If I'm standing. It's difficult to lay down.

345
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:33,033
But take and example from horses. Sleep while standing.

346
00:52:33,033 --> 00:52:38,044
Was I talking to you?
- Do horses even talk?

347
00:52:38,044 --> 00:52:41,681
What a humour.
It suits with your intelligence level.

348
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:44,833
Okay, I will keep myself back.

349
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:04,244
Do you want tea?
- Yes.

350
00:53:05,552 --> 00:53:08,089
I will pour you, brother...?

351
00:53:09,332 --> 00:53:11,789
...on your head?
- You can try, you bastard.

352
00:53:14,162 --> 00:53:15,891
Again.

353
00:53:28,903 --> 00:53:30,564
Thank you.

354
00:54:02,228 --> 00:54:07,619
Ivo, is this your daughter?

355
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:10,370
No, granddaughter.

356
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:18,474
What's her name?

357
00:54:21,989 --> 00:54:25,505
It's not your business.
- Some kind of cars are coming here.

358
00:54:41,127 --> 00:54:43,408
Ahmed, these are abkhazians.

359
00:54:43,408 --> 00:54:46,178
When they will enter, you will turn him in?

360
00:54:46,178 --> 00:54:50,088
Of course not, I have to kill him myself.
- Good.

361
00:54:50,088 --> 00:54:54,552
Then we will tell them, that he is Ibrahim and that you killed all the georgians.

362
00:54:54,552 --> 00:54:57,985
And nobody is asking anything from me?
Ivo, give me my machine gun!

363
00:55:01,518 --> 00:55:03,821
Don't be stupid.

364
00:55:03,821 --> 00:55:08,663
You can't talk, because you have a wound in your head. 
That's it. You will sit silently.

365
00:55:10,648 --> 00:55:12,937
Do you know why you have to be silent?

366
00:55:12,937 --> 00:55:15,805
Because first of all they would shoot me.

367
00:55:15,805 --> 00:55:20,493
Even if they are talking bad about georgians, you will be silent.

368
00:55:23,322 --> 00:55:26,445
So, he can't talk because of his wound.

369
00:55:32,602 --> 00:55:35,363
Hello, Ivo.
- Hello, Aslan.

370
00:55:35,363 --> 00:55:38,136
Hey, we saw a georgian van.

371
00:55:38,136 --> 00:55:41,837
In the gorge, next to Margus's plantation.

372
00:55:44,036 --> 00:55:46,195
And you have a car at your place.

373
00:55:46,195 --> 00:55:48,509
Aha, Margus. You are here.

374
00:55:48,509 --> 00:55:53,305
What happened here? Where are the georgians?

375
00:55:54,202 --> 00:55:59,366
All dead. The chechens killed them. But we rescued two chechens.

376
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:03,811
They are here, wounded.
- In your house?

377
00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:09,649
Step in, I will introduce you.
- Yes, I would shake their hands.

378
00:56:09,649 --> 00:56:11,757
Come in.

379
00:56:19,127 --> 00:56:23,039
Sit, brother, you are wounded.
- It's nothing.

380
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:25,402
Aslan.
- Ahmed.

381
00:56:29,721 --> 00:56:31,510
Aslan.

382
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:43,266
He is Ibrahim, but he can't talk. He got wounded from his head.

383
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:47,583
What... damn bastards.

384
00:56:49,886 --> 00:56:53,390
How is this possible?
He got wounded from his head and tongue doesn't work?

385
00:56:55,853 --> 00:56:59,362
You fool. My neighbour got hit to the head with a brick,

386
00:56:59,362 --> 00:57:01,894
and his legs stopped working.

387
00:57:01,894 --> 00:57:06,700
There are spots in the head, that control all the body parts.

388
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:12,075
For example, here can be the spot for the leg, here for the hand.
Do you understand?

389
00:57:12,075 --> 00:57:15,477
He didn't understand a shit.

390
00:57:17,155 --> 00:57:23,462
I've got good vodka. Sit.
- No, Ivo, we are going straight to the battle front.

391
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,810
We heard that the things are fucked up over there.

392
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:30,863
And what will happen next?
- We will chase them out.

393
00:57:30,863 --> 00:57:35,798
Do you doubt in it?
- No, Aslan, of course not.

394
00:57:35,798 --> 00:57:39,000
These boys will help.

395
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,548
How many georgians were there?
- Three.

396
00:57:42,548 --> 00:57:47,214
They bumped into us on the road and started shooting at once.

397
00:57:48,565 --> 00:57:50,907
We turned around, they were following us.

398
00:57:50,907 --> 00:57:55,019
Ibrahim got a bullet to his head, and we hit the fence.

399
00:57:55,019 --> 00:57:57,321
And drove into the plantation.

400
00:57:57,321 --> 00:58:03,654
I had enough time to hit them with an anti-tank rocket.
- Well done, Ahmed.

401
00:58:03,654 --> 00:58:09,280
The bodies are in the van?
- No. We buried them in the forest.

402
00:58:10,491 --> 00:58:15,955
It would have been better to throw them on the road, like dogs.

403
00:58:15,955 --> 00:58:19,369
Aslan, they are people too, and young people.

404
00:58:19,369 --> 00:58:21,767
Fine, so be it.

405
00:58:21,767 --> 00:58:27,077
Get well.
Most important is, that you would start talking again.

406
00:58:27,077 --> 00:58:30,476
As soon as we will get on our feet, we will join you.

407
00:58:30,476 --> 00:58:32,913
Thank you Ahmed, we are brothers.

408
00:58:42,739 --> 00:58:50,206
Aslan...

409
00:58:50,206 --> 00:58:52,331
Do something good.

410
00:58:52,331 --> 00:58:54,758
I know, it's a bad time at the moment,

411
00:58:54,758 --> 00:58:58,655
but Margus is losing a big tangerine crop.

412
00:58:58,655 --> 00:59:02,180
One major promised to send men, but he didn't.

413
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:07,002
Maybe you can help us.
We will divide the money later.

414
00:59:07,002 --> 00:59:11,664
How many men do you need?
- 30 maybe, 40 would be better.

415
00:59:11,664 --> 00:59:15,728
No problem. In the morning the day after tomorrow, the men will be here.

416
00:59:15,728 --> 00:59:19,290
We are camping next to the river for three days.

417
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:24,935
And don't give any money. Just give the boys a few boxes of tangerines.

418
00:59:27,518 --> 00:59:30,068
Thank you Aslan.
We will be waiting.

419
00:59:30,068 --> 00:59:32,752
The day after tomorrow.
You have my word.

420
00:59:51,854 --> 00:59:56,355
See, Ahmed, the georgian is outside, do you want to kill him?

421
00:59:57,601 --> 01:00:00,379
I'm too lazy to kill him today.

422
01:00:02,082 --> 01:00:07,517
Margus! Aslan promised to send 40 men for the day after tomorrow.

423
01:00:07,517 --> 01:00:09,799
Very well then!

424
01:00:19,548 --> 01:00:23,481
Only with ashes, Margus. Not with the flame.
- I know.

425
01:00:28,528 --> 01:00:33,797
Aren't you cold? I will bring a jacket?
- No, thank you, Ivo, I'm not.

426
01:00:36,231 --> 01:00:40,875
What are you planning to do, when you will get better?
Back to the war?

427
01:00:44,437 --> 01:00:46,503
You don't know yet?
- I know.

428
01:00:46,503 --> 01:00:50,176
And everything is ready.

429
01:00:51,682 --> 01:00:56,286
Now taste and tell me if you 
have eaten anything like that before.

430
01:00:57,754 --> 01:00:59,897
We will try.

431
01:00:59,897 --> 01:01:03,218
Like we would have never eaten before.
- Try it, then talk.

432
01:01:05,198 --> 01:01:07,284
Delicious.

433
01:01:08,312 --> 01:01:10,509
You georgians don't know how to make shashlik.

434
01:01:11,756 --> 01:01:15,360
But you think you can, just like with everything else.

435
01:01:16,651 --> 01:01:20,505
Everything else?
What else can't we do then?

436
01:01:21,965 --> 01:01:24,786
Many things.
- Like what?

437
01:01:29,883 --> 01:01:32,637
For example you don't know how to fight.
You absolutely don't know.

438
01:01:36,324 --> 01:01:39,989
Laugh, as much as you want.
You don't know how, but still you are fighting.

439
01:01:39,989 --> 01:01:43,199
And you are losing every time.
And this is already funny.

440
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:48,403
You are talking nonsense.
I'm telling, you are uneducated.

441
01:01:48,403 --> 01:01:52,634
You don't know history at all.
- That doesn't change anything.

442
01:01:52,634 --> 01:01:56,249
You don't know how to make shashlik, 
you don't know how to fight. That's a fact.

443
01:01:56,249 --> 01:01:58,883
I will show you what I can do.

444
01:01:58,883 --> 01:02:01,247
Do it, kill me as you promised.

445
01:02:01,247 --> 01:02:04,560
We are not in the house. So try.

446
01:02:05,493 --> 01:02:09,650
Then you will see what a georgian is capable of. Make a try!

447
01:02:12,124 --> 01:02:14,200
Okay. Let's see.

448
01:02:18,127 --> 01:02:19,918
Calm down!

449
01:02:21,379 --> 01:02:23,936
Sit down.

450
01:02:26,063 --> 01:02:28,747
Sit!

451
01:02:31,267 --> 01:02:33,250
It's enough of this.

452
01:02:34,317 --> 01:02:37,658
Otherwise I will honestly kill you the same way I saved you.

453
01:02:44,506 --> 01:02:49,534
What is wrong with you, young men?
All the time, I will kill, I will kill...

454
01:02:53,542 --> 01:02:55,941
Who gave you the right for that?

455
01:02:58,198 --> 01:03:01,124
Who?
- The war.

456
01:03:03,685 --> 01:03:05,774
Stupid!

457
01:03:08,415 --> 01:03:11,823
I will pour you?
- Pour if you want.

458
01:03:13,815 --> 01:03:18,725
I can't pour to you yet. You are sick.
But let's say, symbolically.

459
01:03:19,836 --> 01:03:22,837
I don't drink, don't pour to me.

460
01:03:31,389 --> 01:03:33,892
What will we drink for?
- For the death!

461
01:03:37,061 --> 01:03:39,164
Take, Margus.

462
01:03:41,907 --> 01:03:43,860
I can't drink for the death.

463
01:03:45,211 --> 01:03:50,706
Why? It's their own mother.

464
01:03:54,025 --> 01:03:56,464
They are the children of death.

465
01:03:57,828 --> 01:04:03,583
Forgive me, Ivo.
In the name of Allah, it will not happen again.

466
01:04:05,411 --> 01:04:10,173
What does it matter where you will kill each other,
here or somewhere else.

467
01:04:10,173 --> 01:04:13,758
You will get well, go to the battle front, and kill there.

468
01:04:17,717 --> 01:04:20,985
It's foolish to force you to sit behind the same table.

469
01:04:24,935 --> 01:04:30,828
I will drink for life.
- No. For the death.

470
01:04:33,343 --> 01:04:36,508
I raised the toast for the death.

471
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,575
Margus?
- Yes.

472
01:05:04,575 --> 01:05:07,606
Did you solve your tangerine problem?

473
01:05:08,888 --> 01:05:15,678
Yes. I guess I'm bothering you all with my tangerines.
- Not at all.

474
01:05:15,678 --> 01:05:22,063
Look, it's not about money, even though the amounts are big.

475
01:05:22,063 --> 01:05:26,745
It's just that a crop like this is going to waste... It's a pity.

476
01:05:26,745 --> 01:05:33,738
We could help you.
- Yes.

477
01:05:33,738 --> 01:05:36,869
Don't bother, I have alreadymany helpers.

478
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:42,273
Let's see what Ivo will do. I think he got offended.

479
01:05:42,273 --> 01:05:45,881
Ivo didn't get offended, Ivo is pissing.

480
01:06:30,392 --> 01:06:35,893
They were probably trying to bombard Aslan, by the river.

481
01:07:17,716 --> 01:07:20,999
Maybe you will eat something?

482
01:07:53,028 --> 01:07:55,039
Good morning.
- Good morning.

483
01:08:13,446 --> 01:08:15,668
Hello, Ivo.
- Hello.

484
01:08:44,796 --> 01:08:49,068
I want to give you some money, so that you could go home to Estonia.

485
01:08:51,606 --> 01:08:57,046
What are you talking about? I can't accept such money.

486
01:08:57,046 --> 01:09:01,820
What kind of money?
- That kind.

487
01:09:03,547 --> 01:09:05,764
I'm a mercenary, this is my pay.

488
01:09:40,492 --> 01:09:45,805
We respect christianity.
- We also respect other beliefs.

489
01:09:45,805 --> 01:09:49,915
But why did you start talking about religion, all of a sudden.

490
01:09:49,915 --> 01:09:52,191
For no reason.

491
01:10:06,084 --> 01:10:09,344
Who were these other georgians to you?

492
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:13,759
Why are you asking?
- I'm interested.

493
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:21,123
Not very close friends. We met here. But they were good men.

494
01:10:24,355 --> 01:10:30,643
Ibrahim was like a brother to me. We grew up together.
- I'm sorry.

495
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:38,630
We need firewood. I will bring.
- Sit down, let me do it.

496
01:10:38,630 --> 01:10:42,157
No, I will go, I can walk around outside as well.

497
01:10:52,156 --> 01:10:56,971
I'm also sorry that your companions were killed. Good men.

498
01:11:17,422 --> 01:11:20,483
You should have taken it, he was offering with his heart.

499
01:11:30,084 --> 01:11:32,507
I will go and help him.

500
01:11:44,259 --> 01:11:47,013
Let me help you.
- No, I need to move.

501
01:12:08,451 --> 01:12:13,062
You are looking really often at the photo of my granddaughter.

502
01:12:13,062 --> 01:12:16,455
Why?
- I'm not, you're wrong.

503
01:12:22,014 --> 01:12:27,208
No, you are looking.
- To be honest, she is really beautiful.

504
01:12:27,208 --> 01:12:30,665
It seems I can't get my eyes off of her.

505
01:12:30,665 --> 01:12:32,968
Forgive me, Ivo.

506
01:12:32,968 --> 01:12:39,095
In reality she is even prettier.
Her name is Mari.

507
01:12:43,054 --> 01:12:44,912
She is everything to me.

508
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:50,660
Mari lives in Estonia?
- She used to live in this house.

509
01:12:52,374 --> 01:12:56,434
She left together with the others, when the war started.

510
01:12:56,434 --> 01:13:01,545
Why didn't you leave?
Was it difficult to leave from here?

511
01:13:01,545 --> 01:13:03,854
You love this place here?

512
01:13:05,409 --> 01:13:10,229
I love. And I hate.

513
01:13:14,522 --> 01:13:18,325
Do you have any family?
- Only my mother.

514
01:13:18,325 --> 01:13:20,808
My father died ten years ago.

515
01:13:20,808 --> 01:13:23,310
Do you have any sisters or brothers?
- No, I'm the only one.

516
01:13:25,053 --> 01:13:27,636
And what were you doing during the peace time?

517
01:13:27,636 --> 01:13:31,482
I'm an actor. Playing in a theatre.
- Really?

518
01:13:34,078 --> 01:13:36,670
In the movies too?
- Rarely.

519
01:13:36,670 --> 01:13:40,988
There are no movies produced here anymore. There is no money.

520
01:13:40,988 --> 01:13:47,909
And then you decided to join the war.
- Yes, I felt the obligation, and went.

521
01:13:47,909 --> 01:13:50,110
I didn't even tell my mother.

522
01:13:53,591 --> 01:13:58,748
When the war is over, I will come to Thibilisi

523
01:13:58,748 --> 01:14:05,773
and I will watch you acting.
Later we will bring back the memory of these days.

524
01:14:07,268 --> 01:14:12,985
And Ahmed.
- No. Ahmed will be sitting in the theatre with me.

525
01:14:15,043 --> 01:14:16,961
And he will applaude for you.

526
01:14:41,403 --> 01:14:44,196
Come here! You!

527
01:14:46,203 --> 01:14:48,174
Don't show yourself! Sit quietly!

528
01:14:48,174 --> 01:14:51,873
Where are the machine guns?
- There, under the bed.

529
01:14:51,873 --> 01:14:54,351
But don't touch them.

530
01:14:56,404 --> 01:15:00,401
What are you smiling, you georian?
- I'm not georgian.

531
01:15:00,401 --> 01:15:02,976
Are you sure?
- He is one of you, men.

532
01:15:04,820 --> 01:15:09,294
Stay put, old man.
- I'm a chechen.

533
01:15:09,294 --> 01:15:14,068
Then say something in chechenian language.
- I'm a chechen.

534
01:15:14,942 --> 01:15:20,257
I came to fight on your side, 
got wounded and he helped me to heal.

535
01:15:20,257 --> 01:15:24,971
Comrade officer, I know your major.
- Be silent!

536
01:15:26,418 --> 01:15:30,328
Are you stupid or what?
Say something in chechenian.

537
01:15:31,962 --> 01:15:33,608
Say something, you dickhead!

538
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:39,536
And what does it mean?

539
01:15:39,536 --> 01:15:41,815
No, I think he is a georgian.

540
01:15:41,815 --> 01:15:45,946
Are you deaf?
- That was "dickhead" in chechenian.

541
01:15:47,607 --> 01:15:50,769
Shit, shoot him!
- No, he is one of us!

542
01:15:50,769 --> 01:15:53,106
I told you to shut up! Fill my order!

543
01:15:53,106 --> 01:15:55,546
Captain, maybe he is one of us?
- No!

544
01:16:27,969 --> 01:16:29,637
Nika, throw me the machine gun!

545
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:38,919
Cover me!

546
01:16:57,668 --> 01:17:00,270
That's it Nika, that's it!
They are dead.

547
01:17:12,709 --> 01:17:14,590
Margus!

548
01:17:41,856 --> 01:17:44,042
Dickhead...

549
01:19:53,047 --> 01:19:55,906
Ready?
- Yes.

550
01:19:58,178 --> 01:20:00,411
Only your cross is left.

551
01:20:03,406 --> 01:20:05,776
Like that?
- Yes.

552
01:20:09,894 --> 01:20:14,539
And Nika?
- We will bury him to another place.

553
01:20:15,793 --> 01:20:19,900
Where?
- Next to my son.

554
01:20:33,392 --> 01:20:36,641
How did he die?
- He fell when the war started.

555
01:20:38,039 --> 01:20:40,597
Who killed him?
- God knows.

556
01:20:40,597 --> 01:20:45,906
He went to the war right in the beginning. 
To protect our land, he said.

557
01:20:47,707 --> 01:20:49,782
I tried to convince him not to go,

558
01:20:49,782 --> 01:20:54,496
I told him that this is nobody's war, but he wouldn't listen.

559
01:20:55,838 --> 01:21:00,372
So the georgians killed him?
- Yes.

560
01:21:02,118 --> 01:21:05,226
But what difference does it make?
- How so?

561
01:21:06,875 --> 01:21:09,843
You buried a georgian next to your son.

562
01:21:11,496 --> 01:21:13,438
Ahmed, does it matter?

563
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:22,660
Answer me!
- No, it doesn't.

564
01:21:32,065 --> 01:21:36,402
Are you going straight home?
- I miss my family.

565
01:21:39,922 --> 01:21:42,302
Ivo, tell me...

566
01:21:42,302 --> 01:21:45,426
If I would have been killed instead of Nika,

567
01:21:45,426 --> 01:21:53,199
would you have buried me next to your son?
- Yes.

568
01:21:55,192 --> 01:21:57,356
Maybe a little farther.

569
01:22:04,051 --> 01:22:06,609
I really don't know, how to thank you.

570
01:22:09,067 --> 01:22:11,542
Go!
I don't like goodbyes.

571
