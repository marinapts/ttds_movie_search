the chap who did this.

I-I don't believe

75
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:17,183
that you could find the chap
that did this

76
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,519

and spat in your face.

you file your reports
and leave me alone.

00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:24,694
Really?

186
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:27,094
Well, I believe
you've just set the record

187
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:28,257
for the shortest job interview

188
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:29,869
in British military history.

189
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,435
Oh, uh... [chuckles]

190
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,538
Mother says I can be off-putting
sometimes on account

191
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,606
of being one of the best
mathematicians in the world.

192
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,436
In the world?

193
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,203
Oh, yes.

194
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,711
Do you know how many people
I've rejected for this program?

195
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:44,009
- No.
- Well, that's right,

196
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:45,618
because we're
a top-secret program.

197
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,879
But I'll tell you,
just because we're friends,

198
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,453
that only last week,

199
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:52,455
I rejected one of our
great nation's top linguists.

200
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,821
Knows German better
than Bertolt Brecht.

201
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:55,984
I don't speak German.

202
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:57,755
What?

203
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,524
I don't...

204
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,064
speak German.

205
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:02,895
Well, how the hell
were you supposed to decrypt

206
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,559
German communications
if you don't...

207
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,603
[chuckles]
I don't know, speak German?

208
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,174
Well, I'm really quite excellent
at crossword puzzles.

209
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,936
- Margaret!
- The German codes are a puzzle.

210
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,773
A game, just like
any other game.

211
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,574
- Margaret, where are you?
- I'm really very good at games.

212
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,216
Uh, puzzles.

213
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,784
And this is the most difficult
puzzle in the world.

214
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,580
Margaret!

215
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,085
For the love of God.

216
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:24,485
This is a joke, obviously.

217
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:27,217
I'm afraid I don't know
what those are,

218
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,259
Commander Denniston.

219
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:31,864
Have a pleasant trip
back to Cambridge, Professor.

220
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,123
Enigma.

221
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,233
You called for me?

222
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:39,403
[door closes]

223
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,675
That's what you're doing here.

224
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:47,506
The top-secret program
at Bletchley.

225
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,843
You're trying to break
the German Enigma machine.

226
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,349
What makes you think that?

227
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,852
It's the greatest
encryption device in history,

228
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:59,117
and the Germans use it
for all major communications.

229
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:01,818
If the Allies broke Enigma,

230
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,929
well, [chuckles]

231
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:05,826
This would turn
into a very short war, indeed.

232
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,832
Of course that's what
you're working on.

233
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,596
But you also haven't got
anywhere with it.

234
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,136
If you had, you wouldn't
be hiring cryptographers

235
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:15,138
out of university.

236
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:17,299
Y- You need me a lot
more than I need you.

237
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,377
L-I like solving problems,

238
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,139
Commander.

239
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:25,046
And Enigma is the most
difficult problem in the world.

240
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:27,516
No, Enigma isn't difficult;
it's impossible.

241
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,985
The Americans, the Russians,
the French,

242
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,181
the Germans,
everyone thinks Enigma

243
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,416
is unbreakable.

244
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:34,855
Good.

245
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,894
Let me try,
and we'll know for sure,

246
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:38,326
<i>We n.</i> t <i>M?</i>

247
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,124
[Denniston]
Welcome to Enigma.

248
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,969
The details of every
surprise attack,

249
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,667
every secret convoy

250
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:53,005
and every U-boat in
the bloody Atlantic

251
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,908
go into that thing.

252
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:58,312
And out comes gibberish.

253
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:01,044
It's beautiful.

254
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,054
[Denniston] It's the crooked
hand of death itself.

255
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:08,354
Our Wrens intercept thousands
of radio messages a day,

256
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:10,519
and to the lovely young ladies

257
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:12,597
of the Women's Royal Navy,
they're nonsense.

258
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,700
It's only when you feed
them back into Enigma

259
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,064
that they make any sense.

260
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,228
But we have an Enigma machine.

261
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,600
Yes, Polish Intelligence

262
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:21,865
smuggled it out of Berlin.

263
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,031
[man] So what's the problem?

264
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:24,438
Just put
the intercepted messages

265
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:25,601
back into the Enigma
and you'll...

266
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:28,440
Look, it's not
that simple, is it?

267
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:30,777
Just having an Enigma machine

268
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,509
doesn't help you to decode
the messages.

269
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:35,518
[Denniston]
Very good, Mr. Turing.

270
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,350
To decode a message, you need to
know the machine's settings.

271
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:41,016
Now, the Germans
switch settings

272
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,322
every day promptly at midnight.

273
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:44,724
We usually intercept

274
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,695
our first message
around 6:00 a.m.,

275
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,459
which gives you exactly

276
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:52,572
18 hours every day
to crack the code

277
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:54,935
before it changes,
and you start again.

278
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,473
Five rotors.

279
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:58,634
Ten plugboard cables.

280
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,210
- One million...
- A thousand million...

281
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,973
No, no, it's,
uh, I've got it.

282
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,446
[man] It's million, million. It's
in the millions, obviously.

283
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,484
It's over 150 million million
million possible settings.

284
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:08,780
Very good.

285
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,481
159.

286
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:13,820
If you want to be
exact about it. 1-5-9

287
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,223
with 18 zeroes behind it.

288
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:17,886
Possibilities.

289
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:19,793
Every single day.

290
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,458
[Denniston]
Gentlemen, meet Hugh Alexander.

291
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,330
I personally selected him

292
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,768
- to run this unit.
- Didn't you...

293
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,907
Mr. Alexander won Britain's
national chess championship.

294
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:30,474
Twice.

295
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,974
[Denniston]
You're not the only one

296
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,340
who's good at games
around here, Turing.

297
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:36,005
Are-are we
to work together, then?

298
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:38,344
I prefer to have my own office.

299
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:40,350
You're a team,
and you will work as one.

300
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,852
I-I-I don't have time
to explain myself as I go along,

301
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:44,615
and I'm afraid these men

302
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,021
- would only slow me down.
- [chuckles] If you can't

303
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:50,163
play together, then I'm afraid
we can't let you play at all.

304
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,025
This is Stewart Menzies, MI6.

305
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,189
There are only five divisions
of military intelligence.

306
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:56,267
There is no MI6.

307
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:57,801
Exactly.

308
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,337
That's the spirit.

309
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,304
Mr. Turing, do you know
how many British servicemen

310
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:03,465
have died because of Enigma?

311
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:05,543
Uh, no, I don't.

312
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:07,476
Three...

313
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:08,637
while we've been having

314
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:10,783
this conversation.

315
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,548
Oh, look, there's another.

316
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,849
I rather hope he
didn't have a family.

317
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:20,323
This war Commander Denniston's
been going on about,

318
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:22,222
we're not winning it.

319
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,022
Break the code,

320
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:27,132
at least we have a chance.

321
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,860
Shall we leave
the children alone

322
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,561
with their new toy?

323
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:32,830
<i>Hm.</i>

324
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:40,040
All right, gentlemen...

325
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,875
- [door closes]
- let's play.

326
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,185
[Turing]
The game was quite a simple one.

327
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,694
Every single German message,
every surprise attack,

328
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:56,488
every bombing run,

329
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:59,188
every imminent U-boat assault...

330
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:01,333
[Morse code transmissions]

331
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,669
They were all floating
through the air.

332
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,409
[Morse code transmissions]

333
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,115
Radio signals that...

334
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:22,220
well, any schoolboy
with an AM kit

335
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:23,947
could intercept.

336
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,921
[Morse code continues]

337
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:29,426
The trick was
that they were encrypted.

338
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,375
There were 159 million
million million possible

339
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:45,307
Enigma settings.

340
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:47,742
All we had to do
was try each one.

341
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:54,978
But if we had ten men checking
one setting a minute

342
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:58,613
for 24 hours every day
and seven days every week,

343
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:03,319
how many days do you think
it would take to, uh, to check

344
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:05,897
each of the settings?

345
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,831
Well, it's not days, it's years.

346
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,562
Good morning.

347
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:16,572
[Turing] It's 2O million years.

348
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,471
- To stop a coming attack,
- Thank you.

349
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,773
We would have to check
2O million years' worth

350
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:23,677
of settings

351
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,012
in 2O minutes.

352
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,268
[sonar pinging]

353
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,204
[loud whirring]

354
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:53,502
I'm famished.

355
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,647
Lunch?

356
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:57,146
[Alexander]
Good Lord. What is it

357
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:59,182
about women with little hats?

358
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,652
The boys, we're going
to get some lunch.

359
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:14,566
Alan?

360
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:16,168
Yes'?

361
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:17,894
I said we're going
to get some lunch.

362
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,074
Alan?

363
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,231
Yes'?

364
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:24,843
- Can you hear me?
- Yes.

365
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:28,174
[chuckles] I said we're
off to get some Iu...

366
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,475
This is starting to get
a little bit repetitive.

367
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,015
- What is?
- I had asked

368
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:33,515
if you wanted to come
to lunch with us.

369
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:35,085
Um, no, you didn't.

370
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,348
You said you were going
to get some lunch.

371
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,514
Have I offended you in some way?

372
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:40,853
Why would you think that?

373
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:43,519
Would you like to come to lunch
with us?

374
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:45,425
- What time's lunchtime?
- Christ, Alan,

375
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:46,690
it's a bleeding sandwich.

376
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:48,595
- What is?
- Lunch.

377
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:50,532
Oh, I don't like sandwiches.

378
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:51,898
Never mind.

379
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,732
You know,

380
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,068
to pull off
this irascible genius routine,

381
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,835
one actually has to be
a genius, Alan.

382
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,341
And yet we're the ones

383
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:00,570
making progress here,
aren't we?

384
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:01,907
Oh, you are?

385
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,106
Yes, we are.

386
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:07,617
We have decrypted a number
of German messages

387
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:11,018
by analyzing the frequency
of letter distribution.

388
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,625
Oh, even a broken clock
is right twice a day.

389
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:15,591
That-That's not progress;
that's just blind luck.

390
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,627
I'm designing a machine

391
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:20,027
that will allow us
to break every message

392
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:24,033
every day instantly.

393
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:26,567
Who's hungry?

394
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:28,733
Let's go.

395
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:30,069
I'm hungry-

396
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,778
What?

397
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,913
[Turing]
Peter asked who was hungry.

398
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:36,446
Can I have some soup, please?

399
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,607

405
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:05,903
What do you mean, "classified"?

406
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:08,905
No, I'm aware of the literal
meaning of the word classified.

407
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:11,066
What I'm asking is why would
a maths professor

408
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,678
have his military records
classified?

409
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,315
Yeah, well, I will come down.

410
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,724
[bell dings]

411
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,172
Pardon me, I'd like to see
some documents, if I may.

412
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:43,570
Service records
of a Mr. Turing.

413
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:44,767
Alan.

414
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:47,276
Foreign Office sent me.

415
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,209
[bicycle bell clinging]

416
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,918
This is unacceptable.

417
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,954
If you wish to discuss
the complaint,

418
00:20:58,124 --> 00:20:59,250
I suggest you make
a proper appointment.

419
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,415
Alexan...

420
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:01,719
Complaint?

421
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:03,293
No, no, Hugh Alexander

422
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,897
has denied my requisition
for parts

423
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:08,090
and-and equipment that I need to
build the machine I've designed.

424
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,133
Your fellow code-breakers
are refusing to work with you,

425
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:11,701
and they filed
a formal complaint.

426
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,396
It's is inspired
by an old Polish code machine.

427
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:16,303
Only this one
is infinitely more advanced.

428
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:17,772
If you don't respond
to the complaint,

429
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,570
I shall have to take it up
with the Home Office.

430
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:21,110
Put those files by my desk.

431
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,748
Fine, my response is
they're all idiots.

432
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:24,815
Fire them and use the savings
to fund my machine.

433
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:27,749
I only need
about 100,000 pounds.

434
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:30,149
100,000...

435
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,452
Why are you building a machine?

436
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,755
[sighs] It's highly technical.
You wouldn't understand.

437
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:39,626
I suggest you make
the effort to try.

438
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,734
Enigma is...

439
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:44,631
an extremely
well-designed machine.

440
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,603
Our problem is that we're only
using men to try to beat it.

441
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:49,673
No, what if only a machine

442
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:52,174
can defeat another machine?

443
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:53,812
Well, that's not very technical.

444
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,344
Hugh Alexander is in charge

445
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,846
of your unit; he said no,
and that is that.

446
00:21:58,017 --> 00:21:59,451
I simply don't have time
for this.

447
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:02,451
Have you ever won a war, Turing?

448
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:04,487
I have.

449
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,318
Do you know how it's done?

450
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:07,653
Order, discipline,

451
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,295
chain of command.

452
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:11,088
You're not at university
any longer.

453
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:14,665
You are a very small cog
in a very large system.

454
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,360
And you will do as your
commanding officer instructs.

455
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:19,334
Yes.

456
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,200
[clears throat]

457
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:24,536
Who-who is
your commanding officer?

458
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,542
Winston Churchill,

459
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:27,975
Number 1O Downing Street,

460
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:29,706
London, SW1 .

461
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:31,509
You have a problem
with my decision,

462
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,846
you can take it up with him.

463
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:40,614
[Turing]
Mr. Menzies!

464
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,990
Mr. Menzies!

465
00:22:44,163 --> 00:22:47,463
A-A-Are you going to London?

466
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:49,397
Possibly.

467
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:53,004
Would you deliver
a letter for me?

468
00:22:58,677 --> 00:22:59,803
[Alexander]
Look, I'm sorry,

469
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:01,276
but are you joking?

470
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,505
Churchill's put Alan in charge?

471
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:06,208
- This is a terrible idea.
- No, no, no, no, no.

472
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,752
So I can give these
men orders now?

473
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:10,855
I hate to say it, but yes.

474
00:23:11,023 --> 00:23:12,855
Excellent. Keith and Charles,
you're both fired.

475
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,354
- Excuse me?
- What?

476
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:16,824
You're mediocre linguists,

477
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:19,328
and positively
poor code-breakers.

478
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:20,897
Alan, you can't just
fire Keith and Charles.

479
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,431
Well, he just said I could.

480
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:23,830
No, I did no such thing.

481
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:25,528
But Churchill did.

482
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:35,008
[sighs]

483
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:37,115
Go to hell.

484
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:43,712
Well,

485
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:45,584
this is inhuman.

486
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,283
Even for you.

487
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:54,194
Popular at school, were you?

488
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:01,529
[Turing]
The problem began, of course,

489
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:03,698
with the carrots.

490
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:05,708
Carrots are orange.

491
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:07,243
And peas

492
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:08,608
are green.

493
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,613
They mustn't touch.

I got it.

498
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,838
[Turing]
Do you know why people

499
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:37,134
like violence?

500
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:40,176
It is because it feels...

501
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:41,336
good.

502
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:43,641
Humans find violence

503
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,841
deeply satisfying.

504
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:49,648
But remove the-the satisfaction,

505
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:52,655
and the act becomes...

506
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,351
- [panting]
- hollow.

I didn't learn this on my own,

514
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:19,716
of course.

515
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:21,011
I had help.

516
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,645
Christopher helped.

517
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:27,322
Alan, are you all right?

It's not my fault.

521
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:38,498
The carrots got in
with the peas and...

522
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:39,796
I'm sorry.

523
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:41,167
I won't let them do it again.

524
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,899
They're getting worse.

525
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:45,510
They only beat me up because
I'm smarter than they are.

526
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:47,907
No, they beat you up
because you're different.

527
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,139
Mother says
I'm just an odd duck.

528
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:52,340
And she's right.

529
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:54,350
But you know, Alan,

530
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,421
sometimes it's the very people
who no one imagines anything of

531
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,853
who do the things
no one can imagine.

532
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:09,229
So, what do we do now?

533
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,392
We're short on staff.

534
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,935
[Turing]
Well, we, uh, we get

535
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:14,368
more staff then.

536
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,406
And how do you propose
to do that?

00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:48,485
to see Stewart Menzies.

550
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,025
Very good, sir.

00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:52,163

So who are they?

552
00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:53,594
Oh, all sorts, really.

553
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:55,392
Teacher, an engineer,

554
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,160
a handful of students.

555
00:28:57,336 --> 00:28:58,826
And you think they're
qualified for Bletchley

556
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:00,563
'cause they're good
at crossword puzzles?

557
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,730

In order to aid your efforts,

there is, to the right of you,
a green scratch card book.

561
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,245
You are to make notes in that.

562
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,940
Gentlemen, you
have six minutes

563
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:14,085
in which to complete the
puzzle, at which point,

564
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:15,243
I will...

565
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:19,215
Pardon, ma'am,
this room's restricted.

566
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:20,722
Oh, apologies
for my tardiness.

00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,552
Uh, may I continue, please?

569
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,528
- Thank you.
- You're not allowed in here, ma'am.

570
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,325
Oh, but I'm only
a few minutes late.

571
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,058
The secretaries are
to head upstairs.

572
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:31,760
This room's for the candidates.

573
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:33,905
May I get on with
this now, please?

574
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:36,404
L-I am a candidate.

- For what position?
- [groans]

576
00:29:37,743 --> 00:29:38,904
The letter didn't say precisely.

577
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:40,374
Yeah, so secretaries
are to head upstairs.

578
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:42,138
It did say
that it was top secret.

579
00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:43,873
What is going on?

580
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:45,244
L-I solved

581
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:46,816
a-a crossword puzzle
in the newspaper,

582
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:48,544
and I-l got this letter saying

583
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,814
that I was a candidate for
some sort of mysterious job.

584
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:52,582
My name's Joan Clarke.

585
00:29:52,758 --> 00:29:56,422
Miss, did you really solve
this puzzle yourself?

586
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,264
What makes you think I couldn't
solve the puzzle myself?

587
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:01,922
- L-I'm really very good at...
- Ma'am,

588
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,261
- I'll have to ask you to...
- Miss Clarke,

589
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:04,903
I-I find tardiness

590
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:09,632
under any circumstance,
um, unacceptable.

591
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:15,008
Take a seat so that
we may continue.

592
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:19,182
[softly]
Thank you.

593
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:21,277
[Turing]
Now, um,

594
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:23,478
as I was saying,
you-you have six minutes

595
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,625
to, uh, complete the task
in front of you.

596
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:29,489
Uh, gentlemen and lady,

597
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,255

599
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:01,717
Six minutes.

00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:03,156
Is that even possible?

601
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:05,387
No, it takes me eight.

602
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:07,328
This isn't about
crossword puzzles.

603
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:08,864
It's about how one, uh,

604
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,695
approaches solving an
impossible problem.

605
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,702
Do you tackle the whole thing
at once or divide it

606
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,364
into small...

607
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,906
You've finished?

608
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:20,067
Yes.

609
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,754
Five minutes and 34 seconds.

610
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:39,192
You said to do it in under six.

611
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:41,162
[Menzies]
Congratulations.

612
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:44,268
My warmest welcome to
His Majesty's service.

613
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:46,666
If you speak a word
of what I'm about to show you,

614
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:48,670
you will be executed
for high treason.

615
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,175
You will lie to your friends,

616
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:53,107
your family
and everyone you meet

617
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:55,610
about what it is you really do.

618
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:59,777
And what is it
that we're really doing?

619
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:01,851
We're going to break
an unbreakable Nazi code

620
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,613
and win the war.

621
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:06,019
Oh.

00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:17,761
What's that you're reading?

625
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,200
It's about cryptography.

626
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:21,840
Like secret messages?

627
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,099
Not secret.

628
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:26,142
That's the brilliant part.

629
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:29,406
Messages that anyone can see,
but no one knows what they mean

630
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:31,572
unless you have the key.

631
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:39,914
How's that different
from talking?

632
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:41,957
- Talking?
- When people talk to each other,

633
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,288
they never say what they mean.

634
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:44,930
They say something else,

635
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:47,394
and you're expected to
just know what they mean.

636
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:50,001
Only I never do.

637
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:53,763
So, how's that different?

638
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:56,405
Alan, I have a funny feeling

639
00:32:56,575 --> 00:32:58,475
you're going to be
very good at this.

00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:25,834

and then route back through...

00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,495
- [thumps loudly]
- Back to those ones...

646
00:33:50,662 --> 00:33:52,460
Uh, careful, will you?

647
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:54,190
Um, it-it's not a toy.

648
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:55,697

Funny.

649
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:56,857
Looks like a toy.

Bloody great
100,000-pound one.

Lovely, isn't he?

655
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:14,484
[Turing] It's not just a-a usual
humdrum production mill factory.

656
00:34:14,653 --> 00:34:15,814
I mean, well,
as-as I was saying,

657
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:19,252
it's a very important,
uh, radio factory.

658
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:21,654
I-It's not, actually.
Uh, well, um,

Why are you not
at Bletchley?

664
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:42,878
Thank you... so much for
your visit, Mr. Turing.

665
00:34:43,048 --> 00:34:45,244
- Was your trip pleasant?
- Gather your things and let's go.

666
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:48,250
I'm sorry, but I'm unable
to accept your offer.

667
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,388
We feel that
such a position

668
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:52,080
would hardly
be appropriate.

669
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:54,385
You earned a double first
in mathematics.

670
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:57,358
But sadly wasn't granted the
opportunity to become a Fellow.

671
00:34:57,529 --> 00:34:59,395
You belong at Bletchley.

672
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:01,999
[Joan] I'm sorry,
but for someone in my position

673
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,430

Now, you won't have proper
security clearance,

of course, so, uh, we'll have
to improvise things a bit.

Why are you helping me?

696
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:08,698
Because there is only
one thing that matters

in this entire world right
now... do you understand?...

698
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:12,467
and that is
breaking Enigma.

why are you helping me?

701

Oh. Um...

702
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:24,611
sometimes it's the very people
who no one imagines anything of

703

Alan Turing's
classified military file.

- It's bloody empty.
- Exactly.

- It's an empty manila envelope.
- Yeah.

Well, you've cracked the case
wide open, then, haven't you?

Alan Turing's war records
aren't just classified,

712
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:06,350
they're nonexistent.

713
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:08,424
That means someone's
got rid of them.

714
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:10,186
Erased them.
Burned them.

715
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:13,558
And that same person broke into
his house and stole nothing?

716

What, the spies
from the papers?

00:46:53,678 --> 00:46:55,339
- Y-Yes.
- Shall we say hello?

902
00:46:55,513 --> 00:46:56,912
- No.
- Hello.

903
00:46:58,182 --> 00:46:59,911
L-I told you not to do that.

904
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:03,679
- Alan.
- Uh, Hugh, h-hello.

905
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:05,618
- Didn't know you drank.
- He doesn't, really.

906
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:07,349
He just sort of sips
at the foam.

907
00:47:07,525 --> 00:47:09,254
Well, I'll let you into a
little secret, Miss...?

908
00:47:09,427 --> 00:47:10,417
Clarke.

909
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:11,823
- Miss Clarke.
- Please.

910
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:13,760
Foam's my favorite part, too.

911
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:15,023
Is it really?

912
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,633
Come and join us
for a drink?

913
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:18,098
We'll be there
in a moment.

914
00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:20,328
Miss Clarke.

915
00:47:22,473 --> 00:47:25,033
<i>II</i>

916
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:27,041
Well, he likes you.

917
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:28,975
- Yes.
-You...

918
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:32,776
g-got him to like you.

919
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:34,281
Yes.

920
00:47:34,452 --> 00:47:35,715
Why?

921
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:37,786
Because I'm a woman
in a man's job,

922
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:40,356
and I don't have the luxury
of being an ass.

923
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,458
Alan...

924
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:44,788
it doesn't matter
how smart you are,

925
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:46,896
Enigma is always smarter.

926
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:48,554
If you really

927
00:47:48,733 --> 00:47:50,030
want to solve your puzzle,

928
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:52,169
then you're going to need
all the help

929
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:54,361
you can get,
and they are not going

930
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:57,974
to help you
if they do not like you.

931
00:47:58,142 --> 00:48:00,133
[door closes]

932
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:07,845
- What are those?
- Apples.

933
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:10,214
- No.
- Oh, they really are.

934
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:14,325
Um, l... well, Miss Clarke,
Joan actually, um...

935
00:48:14,492 --> 00:48:16,324
said that it would be...
[clears throat]

936
00:48:16,494 --> 00:48:18,986
Nice if I was to, uh,
bring you all something.

937
00:48:19,163 --> 00:48:20,597
So here we are. I...

938
00:48:20,765 --> 00:48:21,857
Thank you.

939
00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:23,693
I like apples.

940
00:48:23,868 --> 00:48:25,700
My best to Miss Clarke.

941
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:27,838
Uh, there are two people
in a wood,

942
00:48:27,972 --> 00:48:30,031
and, um, they run into a bear.

943
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,574
The first person
gets down on his knees to pray.

944
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,541
The second person
starts lacing up his boots.

945
00:48:34,712 --> 00:48:36,339
The first person
asks the second person,

946
00:48:36,514 --> 00:48:38,039
"My dear friend,
what are you doing?

947
00:48:38,215 --> 00:48:39,740
You-you-you
can't outrun a bear."

948
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,715
Uh, to which
the second person responds,

949
00:48:41,886 --> 00:48:43,047
"I don't have to.

950
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:46,246
I only have to outrun you."

951
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,736
I'll be w-with Christopher,
if anyone needs me.

952
00:48:58,903 --> 00:49:01,838
[man] If we assume
that the square root of two

953
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:05,236
is a rational number,
then we can say

954
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:07,537
that the square
root of two

955
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:10,043
is A over B...

956
00:49:10,214 --> 00:49:12,376
where A and B

957
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:15,986
are whole numbers
and B is not zero.

958
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:18,144
Mr. Turing,
passing notes, are we?

959
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:19,881
No, sir.

960
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:29,332
Only Turing would pass notes
written in gibberish.

961
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,968
[quiet laughter]

962
00:49:34,672 --> 00:49:35,901
- [bell ringing]
- All right, gentlemen,

963
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:38,565
do not forget your algebra
over the break.

964
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:42,303
Have a pleasant holiday,
and we'll resume

965
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,643
your irrationals
when you return.

966

00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:18,615

[birds chirping]

971
00:50:20,618 --> 00:50:23,144
But Euler's Theorem
gives you that immediately.

972
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,516
Um...

973
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:26,986
[laughs softly]

974
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:29,387

00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,289
[chuckles]

976
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:36,197
Here. Look at this.

977
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:41,437
If you run the wires across
the plugboard matrix diagonally,

978
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:44,540
it will eliminate rotor
positions 500 times faster.

979
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,870
That's, uh...

980
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,536
actually not an entirely
terrible idea.

981
00:50:51,682 --> 00:50:53,844
I think that was Alan
for "thank you."

982
00:50:57,755 --> 00:50:59,189
Uh, th-that's my sandwich.

983
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:01,586
You don't like sandwiches.

984
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:02,851
[laughs softly]

985
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:16,932
You nervous?

00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:42,199
What happens now?

990
00:51:42,366 --> 00:51:46,064
It-it should work out the
day's Enigma settings.

Lithuania to Denmark,

00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:33,911
Their campaign mounts in fury

1002
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:35,813

No.

Open the door or
we'll break it down.

I can't let you in! I-l...
I cannot let you interfere.

Turn that thing off.

So you've broken
Enigma, then?

1038
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,440
It was just...

00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:47,812
s-still working.

00:54:47,985 --> 00:54:50,215
This is my associate
from the Home Office.

1041
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:52,014
You see, a hundred
thousand pounds

1042
00:54:52,222 --> 00:54:53,917
is rather a
lot of money,

1043
00:54:54,091 --> 00:54:57,083
and he's here to see what
you have to show for it.

1044
00:54:57,261 --> 00:55:00,492
You... will never
understand

1045

the importance of what
I-l am creating here!

1046
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:08,332
Have you decrypted
any German messages?

00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:14,938
Can you point to anything
at all that you've achieved?

1049
00:55:15,112 --> 00:55:18,343
Hmm. Your funding is up,

1050
00:55:18,515 --> 00:55:20,813
and our patience
is expired.

1051
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,577
It's with such
great pleasure

1052
00:55:22,753 --> 00:55:25,017
that I am finally
able to say this.

1053
00:55:25,189 --> 00:55:28,591
Alan Turing,
you're fired.

1054
00:55:28,759 --> 00:55:32,662
Please escort Mr. Turing
from the premises.

If you fire Alan...

1058
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:48,203
well, then you'll
have to fire me, too.

What on earth are you saying?

1060
00:55:51,215 --> 00:55:52,649
[Alexander] Trust me when
I tell you there is no one

1061
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:56,116
who would rather say this
less than I do, but...

1062
00:55:56,787 --> 00:55:57,777
he's right.

1063
00:55:57,955 --> 00:56:00,014
Alan is right.

1064
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,318
His machine can work,
and it's probably

1065
00:56:02,492 --> 00:56:04,392
the best chance
that we've got.

1066
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:06,825
God, it's beyond belief.

1067
00:56:06,997 --> 00:56:09,056
[Cairncross]
If you fire them...

1068
00:56:09,233 --> 00:56:11,634
you'll have to
fire me, too.

1069
00:56:11,802 --> 00:56:13,531
[Peter]
And me.

1070
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:16,867
[Alexander] We're the best
cryptographic minds in Britain.

1071
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,008
Are you going to fire us all?

1072
00:56:19,176 --> 00:56:21,577
Commander, at least
give us some more time.

1073
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:24,237
Six months, and if the
machine doesn't produce

1074
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:26,143
any results that we need,
then we'll go back

1075
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:28,546
to doing things the old way...
how about that?

1076
00:56:35,259 --> 00:56:37,387
One month.

1077
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:38,995
And then,

1093
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,305
Denniston gave me
the Beale cipher,

1094
00:57:24,474 --> 00:57:25,635
and guess what?

1095
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:26,970

"Ask, and it shall

1098
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,413
That was the key.

Itailed him

1105
00:57:59,576 --> 00:58:01,874

where he met a bloke.

1106
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:03,069
They exchanged an envelope.

1107
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:04,839

He confessed.

Arnold Murray.

Hangs around that pub;
men pay him for a go.

1113
00:58:17,594 --> 00:58:19,289
Turing's one of
the men that paid.

1114
00:58:19,463 --> 00:58:20,624
Only Mr. Murray here

1115
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:22,492

bright idea

1116
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:25,465

1117
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:27,125
That's what Turing's hiding.

1118
00:58:27,304 --> 00:58:29,466

1119
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:30,868
- No.
- What's the matter?

- No, this is...

Turing's up
to something important...

1124
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:39,278
He's committed a crime
and he's broken the law.

1125
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:41,178
And with a bloke.
Jesus Christ,

1126
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:42,944

What makes you
say that?

1265
01:06:30,286 --> 01:06:32,812
Well, because I'm sitting
in a police station,

a young man to touch my penis

1267

if machines can think.

01:07:22,071 --> 01:07:24,836

it's not thinking?

And if we can say that
about one another,

01:30:44,205 --> 01:30:47,607
He's really not
the brightest bulb.

1774
01:30:47,776 --> 01:30:49,210
Which is why I need your help.

1775
01:30:49,377 --> 01:30:51,402
I want to know
what to leak to John,

1776
01:30:51,579 --> 01:30:52,740
what to feed to the Soviets,

1777
01:30:52,914 --> 01:30:54,780
as well as
the British.

1778
01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:58,250
[softly]
I... I'm not a spy.

1779
01:30:58,420 --> 01:31:01,583
I'm... I'm just a mathematician.

1780
01:31:02,724 --> 01:31:05,557
I know a lot of spies, Alan.

1781
01:31:05,727 --> 01:31:08,958
You've got more secrets
than the best of them.

1782
01:31:13,335 --> 01:31:16,930
You... you have to promise me
that you will release Joan.

1783
01:31:17,105 --> 01:31:18,937
Yes, Joan's at the market.

1784
01:31:19,107 --> 01:31:21,633
She's gonna be back
in an hour. I lied.

1785
01:31:22,711 --> 01:31:25,578
I better hold on
to these.

1786
01:31:25,747 --> 01:31:27,181
If anybody finds out about them,

1787
01:31:27,349 --> 01:31:30,114
prison will be
the least of her worries.

1788
01:31:32,153 --> 01:31:34,178
Oh,Alan...

1789
01:31:34,356 --> 01:31:37,587
we're gonna have such a
wonderful war together.

1793
01:31:55,977 --> 01:31:58,639
[Turing]
I need you to leave Bletchley.

1794
01:31:58,813 --> 01:32:01,441
- What?
- It's Menzies. I don't trust him.

1795
01:32:01,616 --> 01:32:04,950
- [Turing] It's not safe here.
- Do you think it's any safer

1796
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:06,451
- anywhere else?
- You need to get away.

1797
01:32:06,621 --> 01:32:08,146
You need to get
very far away from me.

1798
01:32:08,323 --> 01:32:10,485
Alan, what's happened?

1799
01:32:13,495 --> 01:32:15,395
We can't be
engaged anymore.

1800
01:32:15,563 --> 01:32:17,622
You... your parents
need to take you back

1801
01:32:17,799 --> 01:32:20,063
and find you
a husband elsewhere.

1802
01:32:21,169 --> 01:32:23,160
What's wrong with you?

1803
01:32:24,973 --> 01:32:27,840
I have something,
uh, uh, to tell you.

1804
01:32:28,009 --> 01:32:29,977
<i>I'm...</i>

1805
01:32:32,514 --> 01:32:34,608
I'm a homosexual.

1806
01:32:36,985 --> 01:32:38,646
All right.

1807
01:32:38,820 --> 01:32:41,312
No, no. M-Men, Joan...

1808
01:32:41,489 --> 01:32:43,423
uh, not women.

1809
01:32:43,591 --> 01:32:45,650
- So what?
- Well,

1810
01:32:45,827 --> 01:32:46,851
I-I just told you.

1811
01:32:47,028 --> 01:32:48,962
So what?

1812
01:32:50,065 --> 01:32:51,191
[exhales]

1813
01:32:51,366 --> 01:32:53,892
I had my suspicions;
I always did.

1814
01:32:54,069 --> 01:32:56,060
But we're not like
other people.

1815
01:32:56,237 --> 01:32:58,205
We love each other
in our own way,

1816
01:32:58,373 --> 01:33:00,774
and we can have the life
together that we want.

1817
01:33:00,942 --> 01:33:03,502
You-you... you won't be
the perfect husband.

1818
01:33:03,678 --> 01:33:05,043
[exhales] Well,
I can promise you,

1819
01:33:05,213 --> 01:33:07,477
I have no intention of
being the perfect wife.

1820
01:33:07,682 --> 01:33:10,117
I'll not be... fixing
your lamb all day

1821
01:33:10,285 --> 01:33:12,276
while you come home
from the office.

1822
01:33:12,454 --> 01:33:14,115
I'll work.

1823
01:33:14,289 --> 01:33:16,223
You'll work.

1824
01:33:17,859 --> 01:33:20,624
And we'll have
each other's company.

1825
01:33:20,795 --> 01:33:22,627
We'll have each other's minds.

1826
01:33:22,797 --> 01:33:25,732
[exhales] That sounds like
a better marriage than most.

1827
01:33:28,303 --> 01:33:31,295
Because I care for you.

1828
01:33:31,473 --> 01:33:35,239
And you care for me.

1829
01:33:35,410 --> 01:33:36,935
And we understand one another
more than...

1830
01:33:37,112 --> 01:33:39,706
more than anyone else ever has.

1831
01:33:41,349 --> 01:33:43,078
I don't.

1832
01:33:45,587 --> 01:33:48,921
- What?
- Care for you.

1833
01:33:49,090 --> 01:33:50,580
I never did.

1834
01:33:50,758 --> 01:33:53,420
L-I just needed you
to break Enigma.

1835
01:33:53,595 --> 01:33:56,690
I've done that now,
so... so you can go.

1836
01:34:02,270 --> 01:34:04,500
I'm not going anywhere.

1837
01:34:04,672 --> 01:34:06,936
I've spent entirely
too much of my life

1838
01:34:07,108 --> 01:34:09,008
worried about what
you think of me,

1839
01:34:09,177 --> 01:34:10,645
or what my parents
think of me,

1840
01:34:10,812 --> 01:34:13,247
or the boys in Hut 8
or the girls in Hut 3.

1841
01:34:13,414 --> 01:34:14,939
And do you know
what? I'm done.

1842
01:34:15,116 --> 01:34:19,178
This is the most important
work I will ever do,

1843
01:34:19,354 --> 01:34:21,652
and no one is
going to stop me.

1844
01:34:21,823 --> 01:34:23,313
Least of all, you.

1845
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:28,852
You know what,
they were right.

1846
01:34:29,030 --> 01:34:31,965
Peter, Hugh, John.

1847
01:34:34,936 --> 01:34:37,132

solitary years...

1852
01:35:01,362 --> 01:35:03,490
and every day we performed

1853
01:35:03,665 --> 01:35:07,295
our blood-soaked calculus.

1854
01:35:07,468 --> 01:35:11,837
Every day we decided
who lived and who died.

1855
01:35:12,006 --> 01:35:13,303
Every day we...

1856
01:35:13,474 --> 01:35:17,502
helped the Allies to victories,
and nobody knew.

The invasion of Normandy.

1861
01:35:26,721 --> 01:35:29,349
All victories that
would not have been possible

1862
01:35:29,524 --> 01:35:32,152
without the intelligence
that we supplied.

01:35:35,296 --> 01:35:39,324
talk about the war as
this epic battle between, um...

1865
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:41,867
civilizations...

1866
01:35:42,036 --> 01:35:43,868
freedom versus tyranny,

The war wasn't like that for us.

1875

For us, it was just...

1876
01:36:09,397 --> 01:36:11,388
...half a dozen

1877

Burn everything.

1900
01:37:17,598 --> 01:37:19,623
- Burn? Why?
- You were told when you started

1901
01:37:19,801 --> 01:37:24,534
this was a top-secret program...
did you think we were joking?

- But the war is over.
- [Turing] This war is.

is unbreakable.

You and Christopher Morcom

1948
01:40:08,102 --> 01:40:11,299
Christopher is dead.

1951
01:40:19,881 --> 01:40:21,872
His mother sent word
this morning.

1952
01:40:22,049 --> 01:40:24,541
The family were
on holiday, you see.

1953
01:40:28,523 --> 01:40:30,355
I don't understand.

1954
01:40:30,525 --> 01:40:33,051
Well, he had
bovine tuberculosis,

1955
01:40:33,227 --> 01:40:35,457
as I'm sure he told you.

1956
01:40:35,630 --> 01:40:37,962
So this won't come
as a shock, but...

1957
01:40:38,132 --> 01:40:40,226
still, all the same,

1958
01:40:40,401 --> 01:40:42,995
I'm sorry.

1959
01:40:43,170 --> 01:40:46,071
You're mistaken.

1960
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:48,709
Did he not tell you?

1961
01:40:48,876 --> 01:40:51,504
Well, he's been sick
for a long time.

1962
01:40:51,679 --> 01:40:54,205
He knew this
was coming soon.

1963
01:40:54,382 --> 01:40:56,908
But he had a stiff
upper lip about it.

1964
01:40:57,084 --> 01:40:59,576
Good lad.

1965
01:40:59,754 --> 01:41:02,382
- Are you all right, Turing?
- Yes. Of course.

1966
01:41:02,557 --> 01:41:05,254
Like I said,
I didn't know him very well.

1967
01:41:05,426 --> 01:41:07,952
Ah. I see.

1968
01:41:08,162 --> 01:41:10,096
Very well.

1969
01:41:13,067 --> 01:41:15,593

I would have come.

01:42:06,721 --> 01:42:08,485
I would have testified.

And what would you have said,
that I, uh...

1979
01:42:11,325 --> 01:42:13,384
I wasn't a homosexual.

1988

Uh, well, the judge
gave me, um, a choice...

1989

1990
01:42:39,453 --> 01:42:42,150
