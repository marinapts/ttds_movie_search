1
00:00:32,404 --> 00:00:35,305
The movie is about to start...

2
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:38,940
The movie is about to start...

3
00:00:39,878 --> 00:00:42,472
The movie is about to start...

4
00:00:43,315 --> 00:00:46,079
The movie is about to start...

5
00:00:47,653 --> 00:00:51,316
Spread love and joy
with people all around you.

6
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:54,982
But don't spread your
legs too far in front

7
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,689
Switch on your clockwork hearts
and tear glands

8
00:00:58,797 --> 00:01:02,426
But switch off mobile phones
and wailing children.

9
00:01:10,275 --> 00:01:11,799
Love in today's world..

10
00:01:11,944 --> 00:01:13,741
is like instant noodles.

11
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:16,609
When it reaches your stomach,
it's mostly over

12
00:01:17,649 --> 00:01:19,446
Love in today's world
is born through Facebook

13
00:01:19,585 --> 00:01:21,314
Comes of age in backseats of cars

14
00:01:21,453 --> 00:01:24,422
And dies in cold legal courts

15
00:01:25,057 --> 00:01:28,686
Our story is about
a very different kind of love

16
00:01:28,861 --> 00:01:32,456
A love filled with rainbows and dreams

17
00:01:32,631 --> 00:01:34,462
lt's not a selfish kind of love

18
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,329
lt's not a messy kind of love

19
00:01:36,435 --> 00:01:39,563
lt's a love that will tickle and linger

20
00:01:39,938 --> 00:01:42,839
The movie is about to start...

21
00:01:43,308 --> 00:01:45,970
The movie is about to start...

22
00:01:47,513 --> 00:01:49,879
The movie is about to start...

23
00:03:44,363 --> 00:03:46,831
l'd often complain to Barfi.

24
00:03:48,367 --> 00:03:51,359
That l didn't have a single
good photograph of him.

25
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,702
But his answer was
always the same.

26
00:03:58,277 --> 00:04:00,268
l'll send you one before l die.

27
00:04:01,246 --> 00:04:02,406
You can have that framed.

28
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,585
And true to his word...

29
00:04:11,657 --> 00:04:13,921
Barfi fulfilled his last promise.

30
00:04:26,772 --> 00:04:28,967
Since l was a child,
my idea of love was...

31
00:04:30,576 --> 00:04:32,305
to live together...

32
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:34,843
and die together.

33
00:04:37,549 --> 00:04:39,517
Just like my grandparents.

34
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:43,720
l was ten,
when my grandpa passed away.

35
00:04:44,957 --> 00:04:48,620
And, a day later,
my grandma also left us.

36
00:04:51,363 --> 00:04:53,354
l yearned for that kind of love.

37
00:04:55,934 --> 00:04:59,734
But Barfi was miles away in Darjeeling
breathing his last.

38
00:05:02,274 --> 00:05:05,266
l wasn't sure if l'd make it in time.

39
00:05:12,985 --> 00:05:14,452
l had learned from Barfi...

40
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:18,889
that happiness is found in the little things.

41
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:23,655
Even a bowl of water is enough
for ships to sail in.

42
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,887
And if you truly believe...

43
00:05:26,765 --> 00:05:29,290
even paper birds can take flight.

44
00:05:32,638 --> 00:05:34,765
Barfi always stayed happy.

45
00:05:35,741 --> 00:05:37,606
And for some strange reason, unknowingly...

46
00:05:37,809 --> 00:05:41,905
l always brought difficulties
into his life.

47
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,481
But he never complained...

48
00:05:48,487 --> 00:05:49,511
neither about me...

49
00:05:50,722 --> 00:05:52,280
nor about the difficulties.

50
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:51,973
Barfi!

51
00:06:52,584 --> 00:06:54,415
- ln the name of the law...

52
00:06:54,486 --> 00:06:55,510
- l order you to stop!

53
00:06:57,489 --> 00:06:59,753
You fools!
What are you doing down there?

54
00:06:59,825 --> 00:07:01,452
He's on the roof!
Get up here now!

55
00:07:25,283 --> 00:07:25,977
- Barfi!

56
00:07:46,671 --> 00:07:48,298
Move out of the way!

57
00:09:36,948 --> 00:09:38,609
lnspector, there seems to be a mistake.

58
00:09:38,683 --> 00:09:42,016
This isn't a mistake.
And thank you very much, Mrs. Sengupta.

59
00:09:42,254 --> 00:09:44,415
l wouldn't have caught him,
if you hadn't filed a complaint.

60
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,321
Where are you taking him?

61
00:09:46,391 --> 00:09:47,619
London!

62
00:09:48,393 --> 00:09:50,361
Just joking, Mrs. Sengupta.
We're taking him to Darjeeling.

63
00:09:50,428 --> 00:09:51,395
Let's go.

64
00:10:12,484 --> 00:10:14,418
Ma'am, sir is on the line.

65
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,282
He's called twice before.

66
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,892
- Why did the cops come home?

67
00:10:27,732 --> 00:10:29,563
- You didn't even bother informing me.

68
00:10:30,435 --> 00:10:31,299
- Hello!

69
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,496
- Who is Barfi?

70
00:10:33,805 --> 00:10:34,965
- Who the hell is he to you?

71
00:10:35,807 --> 00:10:37,832
- We've never had cops in our house before...

72
00:10:38,643 --> 00:10:40,042
Who is Barfi to me?

73
00:10:42,347 --> 00:10:45,043
l had no answer to Ranjeet's question.

74
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,312
- Shruti?

75
00:10:47,452 --> 00:10:50,649
After six years of being married to Ranjeet,
why was Barfi still important to me?

76
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,716
Please give this to Ranjeet.

77
00:10:55,093 --> 00:10:58,893
That day, l broke all ties
to help Barfi.

78
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,861
l guess, l could take such a
drastic step only because...

79
00:11:08,873 --> 00:11:11,467
l was still as deeply in love with Barfi...

80
00:11:11,543 --> 00:11:13,875
as l was the first time l met him.

81
00:11:16,014 --> 00:11:18,505
That was when my dad
had to relocate to Darjeeling.

82
00:11:37,335 --> 00:11:39,303
- Roll-up the window.
You'll catch a cold.

83
00:11:40,305 --> 00:11:42,830
- Who will believe she's
getting married in three months?

84
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,680
108...

85
00:11:57,322 --> 00:11:57,788
What is it?

86
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,955
- Wait, let me check.

87
00:12:19,611 --> 00:12:23,570
101-4, Government Bungalows, Hill Road?

88
00:12:23,648 --> 00:12:26,412
- Hillcart Road...
- Hillcart Road.

89
00:12:38,897 --> 00:12:39,488
ldiot!

90
00:14:16,027 --> 00:14:18,928
l don't want to talk about Barfi.

91
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:26,737
l've spent half my life running after him.

92
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:31,837
lf it weren't for Barfi...

93
00:14:32,844 --> 00:14:35,472
l'd have retired as
the Superintendent of Police.

94
00:14:37,048 --> 00:14:39,414
But now, l sell Homeopathy pills.

95
00:14:40,885 --> 00:14:42,045
Homeopathy!

96
00:14:47,725 --> 00:14:50,319
That rascal Barfi!

97
00:15:29,601 --> 00:15:32,968
Barfi spread love everywhere he went.

98
00:15:34,505 --> 00:15:38,339
But never wanted anything in return.

99
00:15:40,278 --> 00:15:42,872
No wonder he had so many well-wishers.

100
00:15:43,781 --> 00:15:45,646
Barfi and l were childhood friends.

101
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,714
We had a lot of fun.

102
00:15:49,554 --> 00:15:50,919
He was hearing and speech impaired.

103
00:15:51,489 --> 00:15:53,684
But that didn't stop him
from being stubborn.

104
00:15:55,293 --> 00:15:56,851
He had a problem, though.

105
00:15:57,795 --> 00:15:58,989
He thought...

106
00:15:59,397 --> 00:16:01,729
people would abandon him.

107
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,928
That's why he always
put his close ones through a test.

108
00:17:02,627 --> 00:17:03,855
His father lovingly named him...

109
00:17:03,928 --> 00:17:05,589
Murphy, after the Murphy Radio Baby.

110
00:17:07,365 --> 00:17:09,560
lf anyone asked him his name, he'd say...

111
00:17:10,001 --> 00:17:10,865
Barfi!

112
00:20:30,601 --> 00:20:31,590
Barfi.

113
00:21:00,398 --> 00:21:01,888
You're wasting your time.

114
00:21:02,934 --> 00:21:04,265
l am engaged.

115
00:22:03,961 --> 00:22:05,360
Who sent this?

116
00:22:17,475 --> 00:22:20,569
- Look l've put the clock back
by 15 minutes

117
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,971
- Assume that you and l never met.

118
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:27,744
- And assume l never proposed to you.

119
00:22:28,753 --> 00:22:32,382
- Assume you have
made a new friend called Barfi.

120
00:22:32,757 --> 00:22:36,625
- And assume this friend is helping you
plan your wedding.

121
00:22:37,361 --> 00:22:38,293
How sweet!

122
00:22:39,363 --> 00:22:40,990
- And now that
you've assumed all of this,

123
00:22:41,065 --> 00:22:43,898
- why don't you give in with a smile
and wave.

124
00:22:44,802 --> 00:22:46,292
- So cute!

125
00:22:50,975 --> 00:22:54,001
l thought you told him you're engaged
so that he wouldn't bother you.

126
00:22:57,581 --> 00:22:58,343
He's very handsome.

127
00:22:58,649 --> 00:22:59,513
l know.

128
00:22:59,717 --> 00:23:01,412
All the girls at the university
had a crush on him.

129
00:23:02,253 --> 00:23:03,311
Love marriage?

130
00:23:06,891 --> 00:23:07,516
What?

131
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:10,317
One fine day he walked into the library...

132
00:23:10,528 --> 00:23:11,654
held my hand and asked me...

133
00:23:11,796 --> 00:23:12,660
''Will you marry me?''

134
00:23:12,863 --> 00:23:13,352
Then?

135
00:23:14,331 --> 00:23:14,763
Then...

136
00:23:17,001 --> 00:23:19,265
l never hid anything from my mother.

137
00:23:20,037 --> 00:23:23,029
When l told her about Ranjeet...

138
00:23:23,274 --> 00:23:25,299
she only had one question.

139
00:23:25,609 --> 00:23:27,509
''What does his father do?''

140
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,475
After coming to Darjeeling,
l don't know why...

141
00:23:31,682 --> 00:23:35,049
l was happy to be away from Ranjeet.

142
00:24:02,613 --> 00:24:05,241
Barfi came along like a gust of wind...

143
00:24:05,449 --> 00:24:07,883
and in a blink, l was swept
away from my ordinary life...

144
00:24:07,952 --> 00:24:09,613
l didn't realise it.

145
00:24:10,988 --> 00:24:13,923
Barfi showed me how to live.

146
00:24:16,327 --> 00:24:18,921
How to be adventurous.

147
00:24:20,431 --> 00:24:22,956
And the most important lesson
l learned...

148
00:24:23,701 --> 00:24:25,828
is that the biggest risk in life...

149
00:24:26,771 --> 00:24:28,671
is never taking any risk at all.

150
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:57,396
Excuse me... lnspector Dutta?

151
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:00,969
You scoundrel!

152
00:25:01,405 --> 00:25:03,236
- Barfi the Great!

153
00:25:03,974 --> 00:25:05,908
- You think you can
run from lnspector Dutta?!

154
00:25:07,778 --> 00:25:08,608
lnspector...

155
00:25:08,813 --> 00:25:09,837
Sir, please wait...

156
00:25:11,582 --> 00:25:12,571
Mrs. Sengupta...

157
00:25:13,284 --> 00:25:13,773
from Calcutta!

158
00:25:14,685 --> 00:25:15,777
Didn't take you long to get here!

159
00:25:16,887 --> 00:25:18,286
Go on... beat him up.

160
00:25:18,489 --> 00:25:19,649
lnspector, he can't talk.

161
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,248
Of course!

162
00:25:21,358 --> 00:25:22,290
l know that.

163
00:25:22,426 --> 00:25:24,326
We go back a long way.

164
00:25:25,529 --> 00:25:26,791
l think there's been a mistake.

165
00:25:26,931 --> 00:25:28,421
Don't you try to teach me.

166
00:25:28,732 --> 00:25:29,756
There's been no mistake.

167
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,595
And if you want to help him...

168
00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:36,433
find someone who can
communicate with him!

169
00:25:36,507 --> 00:25:40,307
Because if l file a case against him
it will be all over for him.

170
00:25:40,611 --> 00:25:42,476
But what has he done?

171
00:25:43,047 --> 00:25:43,945
What has he done?

172
00:25:44,882 --> 00:25:46,042
What has he done?!

173
00:25:46,283 --> 00:25:47,443
Look at this...

174
00:25:47,518 --> 00:25:49,486
my waist used to be 52 inches...

175
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,552
and now it's 42 inches!

176
00:25:50,621 --> 00:25:51,849
And you ask me?

177
00:25:52,389 --> 00:25:52,650
Come!

178
00:25:54,325 --> 00:25:54,814
Come in.

179
00:25:58,295 --> 00:25:58,693
- Take a look...

180
00:25:59,463 --> 00:26:00,327
- Here's your Barfi!

181
00:26:00,631 --> 00:26:01,359
What has he done?

182
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:04,733
He has robbed a bank,
Mrs. Sengupta.

183
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:06,736
No, no, don't be surprised.

184
00:26:06,904 --> 00:26:08,337
The story does not end here.

185
00:26:08,806 --> 00:26:10,967
He kidnapped the granddaughter...

186
00:26:11,242 --> 00:26:13,369
of the most respected man in Darjeeling!

187
00:26:15,546 --> 00:26:16,308
Here...

188
00:26:17,481 --> 00:26:18,243
This is...

189
00:26:18,983 --> 00:26:20,348
Ms. Jhilmil Chatterjee.

190
00:26:21,685 --> 00:26:22,447
Happy?

191
00:26:34,565 --> 00:26:36,692
She was only six...

192
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:41,304
when Jhilmil's family
left her at Muskaan.

193
00:26:43,707 --> 00:26:45,470
Pure as can be...

194
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,571
and soft as a cloud.

195
00:26:48,646 --> 00:26:52,412
Even back then
Autism was considered a disease.

196
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:56,576
Her parents considered her
an embarrassment.

197
00:26:58,222 --> 00:26:59,587
l also heard that...

198
00:26:59,757 --> 00:27:04,387
her mom tried to strangle her
under the influence of alcohol.

199
00:27:05,696 --> 00:27:10,395
And that's when her granddad
brought her to Muskaan.

200
00:27:11,268 --> 00:27:11,734
Since then...

201
00:27:11,869 --> 00:27:13,996
Muskaan was Jhilmil's home.

202
00:27:17,775 --> 00:27:19,333
You think you'll be able to
take care of her?

203
00:27:20,244 --> 00:27:22,269
How will you look after her?

204
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,508
We have many servants.

205
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,614
Servants!

206
00:27:27,985 --> 00:27:30,749
You see, her grandpa's health
has worsened.

207
00:27:31,322 --> 00:27:32,755
Perhaps his last few days.

208
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,717
And he insists on seeing Jhilmil.

209
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,523
You know very well,
that no one can disobey his order.

210
00:27:39,797 --> 00:27:42,595
Daju, you'll need to come.

211
00:27:53,377 --> 00:27:54,401
Jhilmil...

212
00:28:33,951 --> 00:28:39,014
Of all the kids at Muskaan,
Jhilmil was closest to Daju's heart.

213
00:28:40,491 --> 00:28:41,583
And why not?

214
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:43,917
She was such an angel.

215
00:28:44,461 --> 00:28:48,522
lf Daju had his way,
he'd never let go of Jhilmil.

216
00:28:49,867 --> 00:28:51,698
An alcoholic mother...

217
00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:54,496
a gambling good-for-nothing dad.

218
00:28:55,672 --> 00:29:00,871
Moreover, Jhilmil needed
special care and attention.

219
00:30:30,901 --> 00:30:31,595
Jung Bahadur!

220
00:30:59,329 --> 00:31:00,421
Barfi.

221
00:33:03,253 --> 00:33:04,686
Please, grandpa!

222
00:33:08,659 --> 00:33:09,023
Here.

223
00:33:56,707 --> 00:33:57,674
Shruti!

224
00:36:33,296 --> 00:36:34,627
- You haven't been keeping well...

225
00:36:34,764 --> 00:36:35,856
- but if you could sign these papers--

226
00:36:35,932 --> 00:36:37,763
l'm not going to die...

227
00:36:39,035 --> 00:36:40,297
anytime soon.

228
00:37:47,504 --> 00:37:51,770
Don't laugh at me!

229
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:41,734
What's his name?

230
00:41:43,339 --> 00:41:44,033
Whose name?

231
00:41:45,708 --> 00:41:46,640
Whose?

232
00:41:51,347 --> 00:41:52,336
Barfi.

233
00:42:01,324 --> 00:42:07,024
When l was your age,
l went to school here in Darjeeling.

234
00:42:08,264 --> 00:42:08,753
l know.

235
00:42:09,933 --> 00:42:12,458
Well, there's something you don't know.

236
00:42:13,303 --> 00:42:13,667
What?

237
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:21,607
See that man...

238
00:42:22,946 --> 00:42:24,038
in the blue sweater?

239
00:42:24,347 --> 00:42:24,836
Yes.

240
00:42:26,816 --> 00:42:28,283
He's my friend's brother.

241
00:42:28,985 --> 00:42:30,953
He was very handsome back then.

242
00:42:31,821 --> 00:42:33,379
l was crazy about him.

243
00:42:34,691 --> 00:42:36,989
And l wanted to elope with him.

244
00:42:38,695 --> 00:42:39,320
And then?

245
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:42,698
l was at the railway station...

246
00:42:42,932 --> 00:42:44,331
with a ticket in my hand.

247
00:42:45,301 --> 00:42:46,768
And the train left the station.

248
00:42:47,837 --> 00:42:48,963
l didn't go with him.

249
00:42:52,041 --> 00:42:54,339
Since your father got transferred here...

250
00:42:55,645 --> 00:42:57,510
whenever it's possible...

251
00:42:58,748 --> 00:43:00,306
l come here.

252
00:43:01,517 --> 00:43:02,984
And look at him from a distance.

253
00:43:04,554 --> 00:43:06,852
l am scared to imagine...

254
00:43:08,024 --> 00:43:10,288
what if l had eloped with him?

255
00:43:11,461 --> 00:43:13,725
What would my life be like now?.

256
00:43:15,498 --> 00:43:17,489
What life would l
be able to offer you?

257
00:43:19,569 --> 00:43:21,503
The crossroads you are at right now...

258
00:43:22,272 --> 00:43:23,671
l had turned away from.

259
00:43:28,678 --> 00:43:29,576
But...

260
00:43:33,683 --> 00:43:34,581
l don't love Ranjeet--

261
00:43:34,651 --> 00:43:36,551
Ranjeet is perfect for you.

262
00:43:37,587 --> 00:43:38,918
So is it only about money?

263
00:43:39,822 --> 00:43:40,720
No.

264
00:43:41,391 --> 00:43:42,824
lt's not about money.

265
00:43:45,828 --> 00:43:49,457
He can't say the words
you wish to hear...

266
00:43:50,767 --> 00:43:53,736
and he can't hear the words
you wish to say.

267
00:43:56,506 --> 00:43:58,701
Sometimes silence is
the language of love.

268
00:43:59,242 --> 00:44:03,679
And some day that silence will
drown out your love.

269
00:44:05,348 --> 00:44:07,782
You will use your fingers to talk to him...

270
00:44:08,618 --> 00:44:10,984
but the world will point fingers at you.

271
00:44:17,827 --> 00:44:19,692
Do you really love dad?

272
00:44:22,999 --> 00:44:25,365
Who said you can only love once?

273
00:44:27,804 --> 00:44:30,364
He probably doesn't even
recognise me now.

274
00:44:55,798 --> 00:44:56,230
Here.

275
00:45:01,804 --> 00:45:04,500
Come to me the next time you need money...
and l'll teach you a lesson.

276
00:45:47,417 --> 00:45:49,647
Respected Shruti's father,

277
00:45:49,786 --> 00:45:52,448
Life is a beautiful journey...

278
00:45:52,588 --> 00:45:55,284
who knows what it has
in store for us.

279
00:45:55,425 --> 00:45:56,824
But l do know this.

280
00:45:56,893 --> 00:46:00,294
You love your daughter a lot.

281
00:46:00,563 --> 00:46:02,360
Your daughter loves me a lot.

282
00:46:02,432 --> 00:46:05,367
And l love your daughter a lot.

283
00:46:05,635 --> 00:46:09,435
When there's so much
love amongst us...

284
00:46:09,572 --> 00:46:12,302
why don't we become a family?

285
00:46:12,375 --> 00:46:12,932
Yes?

286
00:46:18,381 --> 00:46:20,713
Please get your daughter married to me.

287
00:46:20,983 --> 00:46:25,249
Our life would then be
the perfect fairy tale.

288
00:46:25,388 --> 00:46:27,652
And, we'd all live happily ever after!

289
00:46:27,824 --> 00:46:30,258
Please say yes.

290
00:46:30,426 --> 00:46:32,553
Yours sincerely, Barfi.

291
00:46:41,671 --> 00:46:42,501
What is it?

292
00:46:45,575 --> 00:46:46,507
Let me check.

293
00:47:05,928 --> 00:47:06,860
- What is it?

294
00:47:08,431 --> 00:47:09,693
He's here for a donation.

295
00:47:10,399 --> 00:47:11,559
You see,
he's hearing and speech impaired.

296
00:47:56,913 --> 00:47:57,641
Barfi.

297
00:53:06,655 --> 00:53:07,519
Move it!

298
00:53:10,526 --> 00:53:11,254
Move it!

299
00:53:23,906 --> 00:53:24,702
Sit!

300
00:53:31,447 --> 00:53:31,845
Right...

301
00:53:33,482 --> 00:53:34,312
tell me.

302
00:53:43,826 --> 00:53:44,554
Jhilmil?

303
00:53:46,295 --> 00:53:48,354
He is asking about Jhilmil.

304
00:54:15,824 --> 00:54:20,420
DROP RS. 7,000 AT
THE POST OFFlCE AT 11 PM.

305
00:54:30,539 --> 00:54:31,733
Who has written this?

306
00:54:34,276 --> 00:54:38,303
BRlNG RS. 100,000 TO
LONA KUKUR BRlDGE AT 11 PM.

307
00:54:55,798 --> 00:54:58,926
You think l'm foolish?

308
00:55:19,855 --> 00:55:21,345
ldiot!

309
00:55:22,524 --> 00:55:24,492
Tell him to start at the beginning.

310
00:55:31,433 --> 00:55:34,561
My mother passed away
giving birth to me.

311
00:55:35,371 --> 00:55:38,272
- My father is a driver--
- Stop it!

312
00:55:40,376 --> 00:55:41,707
Not from that beginning.

313
00:55:44,913 --> 00:55:46,608
Start from this point on.

314
00:56:44,873 --> 00:56:49,708
After Shruti left,
Barfi became a completely different person.

315
00:56:50,479 --> 00:56:53,277
His father lost his job.

316
00:56:55,417 --> 00:56:59,478
This happened after
Jhilmil's grandpa passed away.

317
00:56:59,621 --> 00:57:00,952
Grandpa, wake up!

318
00:57:01,623 --> 00:57:08,222
Jhilmil's grandpa left
his entire wealth to her Trust Fund.

319
00:57:09,231 --> 00:57:15,636
Jhilmil's father was left to live off
a meagre monthly allowance, like the servants.

320
00:57:16,672 --> 00:57:18,503
The arguments got worse...

321
00:57:19,508 --> 00:57:26,710
and one day he got rid of all the servants,
including the old timers.

322
00:57:27,549 --> 00:57:31,713
lncluding Barfi's father and Jhilmil's nanny.

323
00:57:32,454 --> 00:57:38,393
He didn't consider how Jhilmil
would survive without her nanny.

324
00:58:56,538 --> 00:58:57,903
Kidney failure...

325
00:58:58,974 --> 00:59:01,670
He needs surgery.

326
00:59:02,845 --> 00:59:04,745
Seven thousand rupees...

327
00:59:13,655 --> 00:59:15,520
Within two days...

328
00:59:15,924 --> 00:59:16,822
two days.

329
01:00:54,923 --> 01:00:55,719
Hello...

330
01:00:56,425 --> 01:00:57,289
Yes!

331
01:00:58,427 --> 01:00:59,758
Mr. Chatterjee...

332
01:01:00,362 --> 01:01:01,659
Good evening, sir.

333
01:01:02,698 --> 01:01:03,630
Kidnapped?

334
01:01:04,967 --> 01:01:06,264
Your daughter?

335
01:01:07,269 --> 01:01:08,497
Are you sure?

336
01:01:35,697 --> 01:01:38,291
Who was the last to see her?

337
01:01:38,533 --> 01:01:41,297
l was reading her a bedtime story...

338
01:01:41,336 --> 01:01:44,863
lf she was asleep,
how could she be kidnapped?

339
01:01:45,307 --> 01:01:46,934
For God's sake!
l received a call.

340
01:01:47,476 --> 01:01:49,467
For a ransom of 50,000 rupees!

341
01:01:49,544 --> 01:01:49,942
50,000?

342
01:01:50,078 --> 01:01:51,340
This way, please...

343
01:01:53,315 --> 01:01:54,043
Do you suspect anyone?

344
01:01:54,316 --> 01:01:56,284
l mean, do you have any enemies?

345
01:01:56,518 --> 01:01:58,247
He has several debts...

346
01:01:58,387 --> 01:01:59,979
so, yes, there are enemies.

347
01:02:00,288 --> 01:02:01,277
l'm sorry.

348
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:03,517
- Sorry, she's been drinking.
- l'm sure its one of them.

349
01:02:03,558 --> 01:02:06,527
- Please, can you stop drinking?
- l was not drinking.

350
01:02:09,297 --> 01:02:11,356
Go call the other servants.

351
01:02:11,433 --> 01:02:12,365
Take him with you.

352
01:02:14,336 --> 01:02:15,268
You tried to strangle her
when she was a child.

353
01:02:15,303 --> 01:02:16,702
Why do you have to bring that up?

354
01:02:16,905 --> 01:02:17,667
How can l forget it?

355
01:02:17,806 --> 01:02:18,431
Shut up!

356
01:02:18,573 --> 01:02:19,335
You shut up!

357
01:02:52,841 --> 01:02:54,968
MR. CHATTERJEE'S DAUGHTER KlDNAPPED

358
01:05:24,259 --> 01:05:24,816
Barfi!

359
01:05:39,674 --> 01:05:42,541
- Where were you?

360
01:05:43,378 --> 01:05:44,367
Where are you going?

361
01:05:44,946 --> 01:05:45,970
Mr. Dutta!

362
01:05:46,881 --> 01:05:47,939
We are late.

363
01:06:56,484 --> 01:06:57,542
- lnspector Dutta, do something!

364
01:11:35,029 --> 01:11:35,859
Barfi.

365
01:11:46,407 --> 01:11:47,601
Got to pee...

366
01:12:29,350 --> 01:12:30,510
No, don't shut the door...

367
01:14:55,003 --> 01:14:57,130
DROP RS. 7,000 AT
THE POST OFFlCE AT 11 PM.

368
01:15:08,383 --> 01:15:09,543
- Who goes there?

369
01:15:10,485 --> 01:15:11,679
- Who goes there?

370
01:16:27,061 --> 01:16:28,289
Open the door.

371
01:16:42,277 --> 01:16:44,245
Open the door.

372
01:17:43,238 --> 01:17:46,503
l looked after her for 15 years,
but you...

373
01:17:46,708 --> 01:17:48,608
couldn't take care of her for 15 days!

374
01:17:48,910 --> 01:17:50,468
When did you get this letter?

375
01:17:50,945 --> 01:17:52,071
l got it this morning
in the letterbox.

376
01:17:52,213 --> 01:17:54,204
- l told you
not to take her away!

377
01:17:55,116 --> 01:17:56,913
Money is all that matters to you!

378
01:17:57,418 --> 01:17:59,511
l know what's happening here.

379
01:17:59,587 --> 01:18:00,451
What are you trying to say?

380
01:18:00,588 --> 01:18:02,146
How can you talk like that?

381
01:18:02,457 --> 01:18:04,322
You don't know the facts!

382
01:18:04,692 --> 01:18:05,920
There's a cop here.

383
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:07,288
Yet you're saying such things.

384
01:18:09,063 --> 01:18:09,927
lnspector...

385
01:18:11,332 --> 01:18:13,300
please investigate this thoroughly.

386
01:18:13,668 --> 01:18:15,659
- l think Jhilmil's family is involved.

387
01:24:28,676 --> 01:24:29,370
209...

388
01:24:29,510 --> 01:24:31,171
- 210?
- 210.

389
01:24:31,245 --> 01:24:32,678
- 211?
- 211.

390
01:24:33,681 --> 01:24:35,239
What is the patient's name?

391
01:24:36,183 --> 01:24:37,241
Jung Bahadur.

392
01:25:00,408 --> 01:25:04,640
Eeny Meeny Miny Moe

393
01:26:29,964 --> 01:26:31,488
Sir, the Senior lnspector wants to see you.

394
01:26:38,506 --> 01:26:38,995
Sir...

395
01:26:40,407 --> 01:26:41,465
Sir, my wife is...

396
01:26:42,209 --> 01:26:42,573
pregnant.

397
01:26:42,710 --> 01:26:44,007
But you aren't!

398
01:26:44,211 --> 01:26:45,303
Stay here.

399
01:26:52,953 --> 01:26:53,681
Did he tell you?

400
01:26:55,222 --> 01:26:56,154
He didn't tell me.

401
01:26:57,691 --> 01:26:59,124
Did you tell him?

402
01:27:00,561 --> 01:27:01,550
l didn't tell him.

403
01:27:04,265 --> 01:27:05,254
What do we do?

404
01:27:06,534 --> 01:27:08,229
- Tell me.
- You tell me, sir.

405
01:27:10,037 --> 01:27:10,696
What do we do?

406
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:13,607
He's already here.

407
01:27:17,411 --> 01:27:18,969
Yes, sir, he is here.

408
01:27:20,014 --> 01:27:21,003
Will you go?

409
01:27:21,615 --> 01:27:22,604
Or should l?

410
01:27:26,253 --> 01:27:27,242
There's an hour to go.

411
01:27:30,224 --> 01:27:32,988
l will continue the interrogation.

412
01:27:33,727 --> 01:27:36,992
We got two ransom notes.

413
01:27:38,265 --> 01:27:42,429
The first, for 7,000 rupees,
was written by Barfi.

414
01:27:44,505 --> 01:27:47,668
But we don't know who wrote
the second note for 100,000 rupees.

415
01:27:49,944 --> 01:27:52,435
'lf your daughter's life is dear to you...

416
01:27:53,948 --> 01:27:56,007
come with 100,000 rupees to...

417
01:27:57,017 --> 01:28:00,316
Lona Kukur bridge at 11 pm.

418
01:28:00,988 --> 01:28:02,615
Otherwise the girl is dead.'

419
01:28:03,357 --> 01:28:06,121
So the Senior lnspector and Mr. Chatterjee...

420
01:28:06,260 --> 01:28:09,559
went to the bridge at 11 pm sharp.

421
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:17,454
All night long, many officers...

422
01:29:18,933 --> 01:29:20,696
tried to look for Jhilmil
in the lake.

423
01:29:24,038 --> 01:29:26,268
The strange thing about this case was...

424
01:29:29,576 --> 01:29:31,407
no one could identify the villain.

425
01:29:33,447 --> 01:29:36,143
lf Jhilmil were to be killed...

426
01:29:36,684 --> 01:29:38,413
who would stand to gain?

427
01:29:41,121 --> 01:29:44,557
l continued with my interrogation.

428
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:49,657
l was sure of getting a lead somewhere.

429
01:29:51,665 --> 01:29:53,064
l didn't get any leads.

430
01:29:54,568 --> 01:29:56,092
But what l did get...

431
01:29:57,338 --> 01:29:59,203
was emotionally shocking.

432
01:30:59,299 --> 01:31:01,096
- You can't get away!

433
01:31:01,368 --> 01:31:03,233
- Hey... wait!

434
01:32:28,956 --> 01:32:30,981
- Do you want to go or not?

435
01:36:40,340 --> 01:36:41,307
- Barfi...

436
01:36:44,244 --> 01:36:45,609
- Barfi...

437
01:37:05,198 --> 01:37:07,223
Barfi!

438
01:41:52,986 --> 01:41:55,978
CHATTERJEE GlRL MlSSlNG
KlDNAPPER ON THE RUN.

439
01:43:34,954 --> 01:43:36,922
Sorry, sir.

440
01:43:39,125 --> 01:43:41,252
The Senior lnspector wants to see you.

441
01:44:01,014 --> 01:44:01,673
Excuse me!

442
01:44:10,990 --> 01:44:12,184
Mr. Sengupta.

443
01:44:13,326 --> 01:44:14,054
Waiting.

444
01:44:43,389 --> 01:44:45,516
Once again l lost my resolve
when l saw Ranjeet.

445
01:44:47,594 --> 01:44:50,154
Once again l'd left Barfi behind.

446
01:44:55,001 --> 01:44:57,333
But destiny kept bringing me
back to him.

447
01:44:58,104 --> 01:44:59,503
Yet, l don't know why...

448
01:45:01,341 --> 01:45:04,242
l never had the courage to follow my heart.

449
01:45:05,945 --> 01:45:09,642
Perhaps that's why destiny didn't favour me.

450
01:45:11,451 --> 01:45:14,045
Barfi could've taken Jhilmil anywhere.

451
01:45:15,655 --> 01:45:17,623
But destiny brought him to Kolkata.

452
01:45:20,159 --> 01:45:23,424
Or he came there intentionally.

453
01:45:25,632 --> 01:45:30,228
Because he knew l had moved to
Kolkata after my wedding.

454
01:47:57,917 --> 01:47:58,975
A...

455
01:48:00,219 --> 01:48:01,379
A...

456
01:48:09,162 --> 01:48:10,026
B...

457
01:48:10,963 --> 01:48:11,361
B...

458
01:48:11,431 --> 01:48:12,625
B...

459
01:48:13,032 --> 01:48:16,559
B for Barfi...

460
01:48:16,969 --> 01:48:18,698
Barfi...

461
01:48:18,971 --> 01:48:19,938
Barfi!

462
01:52:49,375 --> 01:52:54,074
l never imagined
Barfi would enter my life again.

463
01:52:55,948 --> 01:52:58,416
And when l met him
after all this time...

464
01:52:59,919 --> 01:53:02,911
l wasn't just meeting Barfi.

465
01:53:03,923 --> 01:53:05,288
But also the girl...

466
01:53:06,459 --> 01:53:09,155
who lost herself after
becoming Mrs. Sengupta.

467
01:54:51,163 --> 01:54:51,993
Mom once said...

468
01:54:52,064 --> 01:54:54,362
that a silence would envelope
Barfi and me.

469
01:54:54,667 --> 01:54:57,261
And that some day that
silence would drown out our love.

470
01:54:58,270 --> 01:55:02,297
But silence was all Ranjeet and l had.

471
01:55:03,275 --> 01:55:07,405
We could hear each other clearly...
but we didn't feel a thing.

472
01:55:08,247 --> 01:55:10,613
ln every way we were complete...

473
01:55:10,983 --> 01:55:13,042
but our love remained incomplete.

474
01:55:14,987 --> 01:55:17,114
You could say, in some ways
Barfi was incomplete...

475
01:55:17,623 --> 01:55:20,023
but his love was complete.

476
01:59:36,648 --> 01:59:38,445
All l know is that she is from Darjeeling.

477
01:59:39,218 --> 01:59:41,413
But what about her parents?
Don't you have any other details?

478
01:59:54,133 --> 01:59:55,327
Mrs. Sengupta?

479
01:59:55,501 --> 01:59:56,991
Yes.

480
01:59:57,603 --> 01:59:59,969
Jhilmil Chatterjee's missing report?

481
02:00:00,172 --> 02:00:01,196
Yes?

482
02:00:01,340 --> 02:00:02,136
Did you report it?

483
02:00:02,207 --> 02:00:03,003
Yes.

484
02:00:24,963 --> 02:00:28,558
Jhilmil went missing three times.

485
02:00:31,003 --> 02:00:32,561
First, she was kidnapped from her home.

486
02:00:33,272 --> 02:00:37,436
The second time
Barfi took her from under our nose!

487
02:00:39,244 --> 02:00:43,374
The next six months
l didn't hear a thing.

488
02:00:44,550 --> 02:00:47,610
l assumed it was the end of the case.

489
02:00:49,388 --> 02:00:53,415
- But, six months later,
Mr. Chatterjee called me...

490
02:00:54,259 --> 02:00:55,157
- to his house.

491
02:00:56,061 --> 02:00:57,460
- And, why did he call me?

492
02:00:58,964 --> 02:01:02,092
To give me the
100,000 rupee ransom note.

493
02:01:03,302 --> 02:01:04,360
Case reopened.

494
02:01:06,238 --> 02:01:10,231
- But, even before l could get started,
l got a call from Calcutta.

495
02:01:11,243 --> 02:01:14,508
- That a certain Mrs. Sengupta in Calcutta...

496
02:01:14,580 --> 02:01:17,913
- had reported Jhilmil missing.

497
02:01:18,650 --> 02:01:21,448
Jhilmil missing in Calcutta...

498
02:01:23,355 --> 02:01:24,652
and ransom note in Darjeeling.

499
02:01:24,957 --> 02:01:27,323
lt made no sense.

500
02:01:27,993 --> 02:01:32,089
Just like a bad detective novel.

501
02:01:36,034 --> 02:01:36,466
Now?.

502
02:01:38,103 --> 02:01:38,501
What now, sir?

503
02:01:39,938 --> 02:01:41,428
We have to tell the girl's father...

504
02:01:42,307 --> 02:01:44,036
who killed her.

505
02:01:45,010 --> 02:01:45,669
Who?

506
02:01:48,914 --> 02:01:50,142
Who is in our custody?

507
02:01:50,449 --> 02:01:51,245
Barfi.

508
02:01:52,084 --> 02:01:52,914
He killed Jhilmil.

509
02:01:54,086 --> 02:01:55,280
How could he have killed her...

510
02:01:56,121 --> 02:01:57,179
while he has been in our custody?

511
02:01:57,422 --> 02:02:01,358
You and l know that,
but Mr. Chatterjee doesn't.

512
02:02:02,394 --> 02:02:03,554
No.

513
02:02:04,162 --> 02:02:05,595
Fundamentally, this is wrong, sir.

514
02:02:06,298 --> 02:02:09,529
Fundamentally, he can
dismiss us from ourjobs.

515
02:02:10,302 --> 02:02:11,394
He's very powerful.

516
02:02:11,904 --> 02:02:13,371
He can take names off school rolls.

517
02:02:13,505 --> 02:02:15,973
l don't go to school, sir.

518
02:02:16,174 --> 02:02:17,607
But your kids do.

519
02:02:18,277 --> 02:02:21,337
lf you lose yourjob,
how will you pay the fees?

520
02:02:22,214 --> 02:02:25,240
We'll tell Chatterjee that we arrested him
after the girl died.

521
02:02:26,151 --> 02:02:28,676
He is hearing and speech impaired.
He can't argue, simple!

522
02:02:41,133 --> 02:02:42,623
Hello... Mr. Chatterjee...

523
02:03:05,424 --> 02:03:07,153
What are you looking for?

524
02:03:08,427 --> 02:03:09,621
The lawyer's number.

525
02:03:22,507 --> 02:03:25,305
Why don't you eat something...

526
02:03:29,514 --> 02:03:30,242
- Shruti...

527
02:03:34,252 --> 02:03:36,413
You lied to me, mom.

528
02:03:38,523 --> 02:03:43,654
Why do you sneak out
to see that man?

529
02:03:45,530 --> 02:03:47,998
lt's because you still love him.

530
02:03:50,235 --> 02:03:51,133
Don't you?

531
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:57,099
Do you really love dad?

532
02:04:23,168 --> 02:04:25,329
- Mr. Chatterjee... don't do this.

533
02:04:27,606 --> 02:04:29,699
- Mr. Chatterjee, listen...

534
02:04:30,075 --> 02:04:31,975
- Control yourself... please!

535
02:04:40,085 --> 02:04:41,052
- l request you.

536
02:04:41,186 --> 02:04:43,086
- Get a hold of yourself!

537
02:04:43,555 --> 02:04:46,581
- Barfi! Don't do that.

538
02:05:29,634 --> 02:05:30,259
Hello...

539
02:05:32,370 --> 02:05:33,029
Yes.

540
02:05:43,115 --> 02:05:44,275
Okay lnspector, l'll be there.

541
02:05:51,256 --> 02:05:52,518
Do you really have to go?

542
02:05:58,964 --> 02:05:59,521
Shruti...

543
02:06:02,300 --> 02:06:03,358
Then don't come back.

544
02:06:26,625 --> 02:06:27,990
Thank you, Mrs. Sengupta.

545
02:06:29,394 --> 02:06:31,487
l wasn't sure who to call.

546
02:06:33,331 --> 02:06:35,265
And l didn't think
anybody else would turn up.

547
02:06:37,302 --> 02:06:39,327
- We don't know who murdered Jhilmil.

548
02:06:40,172 --> 02:06:43,232
- But when asked,
the cops will say he did it.

549
02:06:44,976 --> 02:06:45,965
l'll find out...

550
02:06:47,212 --> 02:06:48,509
who the real culprit is.

551
02:06:50,081 --> 02:06:51,241
- But that could take some time.

552
02:06:53,618 --> 02:06:55,552
l don't have a soft corner for him.

553
02:06:57,189 --> 02:06:59,123
But l guess you do...

554
02:07:01,293 --> 02:07:03,921
- He'll get trapped, Mrs. Sengupta.

555
02:07:05,197 --> 02:07:06,494
- They are a powerful family.

556
02:07:07,666 --> 02:07:09,156
- Take him away.

557
02:07:10,535 --> 02:07:11,399
But...

558
02:07:13,205 --> 02:07:15,002
everybody deserves a second chance.

559
02:07:24,950 --> 02:07:26,474
- Here... a ticket for Calcutta.

560
02:07:26,618 --> 02:07:27,676
Thank you!

561
02:07:31,690 --> 02:07:33,248
One more ticket, please.

562
02:11:35,366 --> 02:11:36,993
l don't know why but...

563
02:11:38,169 --> 02:11:41,002
l wasn't really concerned
about Jhilmil's disappearance.

564
02:11:41,506 --> 02:11:42,700
ln fact, l was happy.

565
02:11:44,576 --> 02:11:46,271
Because, finally Barfi was mine.

566
02:11:47,979 --> 02:11:49,879
But someone who loses their love...

567
02:11:50,081 --> 02:11:53,608
and goes on with life,
who knew that better than me.

568
02:11:55,487 --> 02:11:57,978
Living with Barfi l realised that...

569
02:11:58,556 --> 02:12:00,217
l finally got my opportunity.

570
02:12:00,959 --> 02:12:02,483
But a little too late.

571
02:12:03,995 --> 02:12:06,225
There l was with Barfi...

572
02:12:06,898 --> 02:12:11,301
but Barfi was still devoted to Jhilmil.

573
02:13:40,959 --> 02:13:42,153
- So, you're Barfi.

574
02:13:43,394 --> 02:13:46,022
- You're here looking for Jhilmil.

575
02:13:47,465 --> 02:13:48,454
But why here?

576
02:13:50,134 --> 02:13:52,432
Jhilmil had the number of this place.

577
02:13:57,575 --> 02:14:01,375
So he thought... his last hope...

578
02:14:01,713 --> 02:14:03,578
Why would Jhilmil be here?

579
02:14:05,583 --> 02:14:06,675
lt's been so long since--

580
02:14:08,720 --> 02:14:10,517
- Jhilmil didn't come here.

581
02:14:12,323 --> 02:14:13,984
- Please leave!

582
02:14:14,359 --> 02:14:15,383
- Please go away.

583
02:14:16,594 --> 02:14:17,686
- Please go!

584
02:14:19,597 --> 02:14:20,996
- Jhilmil is not here.

585
02:14:23,334 --> 02:14:24,562
- Jhilmil is not here!

586
02:14:26,471 --> 02:14:32,637
- Get him... catch him...

587
02:15:30,568 --> 02:15:31,728
Daju...

588
02:15:33,538 --> 02:15:34,562
Jhilmil...

589
02:15:39,711 --> 02:15:41,269
l hope you haven't told anyone.

590
02:15:42,346 --> 02:15:43,370
- Please don't.

591
02:15:45,750 --> 02:15:48,617
- What could l do...
l was in a mess.

592
02:15:50,021 --> 02:15:52,990
- l thought she'd go missing
for a few hours.

593
02:15:53,124 --> 02:15:56,116
-This was the best way to get money
from my own family!

594
02:15:56,994 --> 02:15:58,359
- The debts were killing me.

595
02:15:59,163 --> 02:16:01,495
- Jhilmil's grandpa made sure
l only got a measly amount every month.

596
02:16:01,632 --> 02:16:04,658
- He left the rest of his wealth
in Jhilmil's Trust Fund.

597
02:16:07,004 --> 02:16:10,371
- This was the only way to
get funds out of the Trust.

598
02:16:12,543 --> 02:16:13,601
- l made a mistake.

599
02:16:15,313 --> 02:16:16,644
A grave mistake.

600
02:16:17,982 --> 02:16:20,143
- l really care about Jhilmil, Daju.

601
02:16:20,485 --> 02:16:23,613
Will you take Jhilmil
away from here again?

602
02:16:24,622 --> 02:16:25,611
- Yes.

603
02:16:26,224 --> 02:16:29,250
- Her mother wouldn't want her
to be here.

604
02:16:30,628 --> 02:16:34,064
Do you still need the money?

605
02:16:38,970 --> 02:16:40,028
Jhilmil is...

606
02:16:41,572 --> 02:16:42,698
very happy here.

607
02:17:58,182 --> 02:18:00,980
Daju looked at
Barfi's attempts in silence.

608
02:18:01,452 --> 02:18:03,443
Here was Barfi...

609
02:18:04,255 --> 02:18:06,951
who cared for Jhilmil even
more than he did.

610
02:18:07,959 --> 02:18:11,656
Whether Jhilmil would stay back at Muskaan
or go away with Barfi....

611
02:18:12,196 --> 02:18:15,131
was a decision
he left to Jhilmil.

612
02:18:30,581 --> 02:18:31,946
- Barfi...

613
02:18:32,650 --> 02:18:35,050
- Barfi...

614
02:18:36,187 --> 02:18:37,279
- Barfi!

615
02:24:25,069 --> 02:24:27,264
That was the love
l always yearned for.

616
02:24:28,539 --> 02:24:30,166
Just like my grandparents.

617
02:24:31,642 --> 02:24:33,109
True love.

618
02:24:34,211 --> 02:24:36,509
To live together and die together...

619
02:24:38,182 --> 02:24:39,979
in each other's arms.

620
02:24:41,118 --> 02:24:43,177
So no ones left behind in tears.

621
02:24:46,323 --> 02:24:47,551
They left...

622
02:24:48,626 --> 02:24:49,593
together.

623
02:24:50,694 --> 02:24:53,458
Leaving me all alone.

624
02:24:56,133 --> 02:24:58,260
lt could have been me
instead of Jhilmil.

625
02:24:59,169 --> 02:25:00,932
But it was Jhilmil who got Barfi.

626
02:25:02,473 --> 02:25:05,601
Because she didn't
plan to fall in love.

627
02:25:06,243 --> 02:25:09,235
She didn't think
about the consequences.

628
02:25:10,948 --> 02:25:14,179
She didn't think
how life would turn out.

629
02:25:15,419 --> 02:25:18,013
She just loved him unconditionally.

630
02:25:18,522 --> 02:25:23,289
And it all turned out well
in the end.
