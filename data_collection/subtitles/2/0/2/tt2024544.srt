1
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,911
Alright now! You all fresh niggers,
you'all gonna be in the cutting game.

2
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,868
Very simple!
I want you to take your knife...

3
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,900
lift 'em cane;
make 'em sing.

4
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,900
Take the cane off.

5
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,950
Cut my tops..
Clean the stalks off.

6
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:29,500
Throw it on the pile...
for replanting again.

7
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,400
Now... them cane ain't gonna jump up
and bite you, don't shy 'bout it.

8
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,994
Rushy boys, rushy!

9
00:07:06,362 --> 00:07:09,706
Alright, alright... alright.

10
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,100
Come on.

11
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,000
Get in there, boy.

12
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,550
Come on.

13
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,650
Give me a kiss.

14
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,550
I love you.
- I love you too, Dad.

15
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,650
Sleep well.

16
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,800
I'll take this.

17
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,950
I don't wanna hear anymore noise.

18
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,850
Good night.

19
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,250
Three weeks and two days.

20
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,550
It is the custom.

21
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:55,700
I wonder what you'll do without me?

22
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,250
I won't stay idle.

23
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:02,350
Darling, it's good money.

24
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,100
If only I didn't have to share your cooking
with other people.

25
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,100
You don't.

26
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,500
Come on.

27
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,000
Be good for your mother.

28
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,900
Ok, Alonzo?

29
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,700
Can I get a kiss, please?
Thank you.

30
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,300
Travel safely, love.
- Stay safely.

31
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,750
Ready.

32
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:43,350
Good afternoon, Mr. Nortap.
- Good day.

33
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,150
Call the Devil's name...
There he is now.

34
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:51,500
Mr. Northup...! I have two gentlemen
acquaintance you should make.

35
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,800
Messrs. Brown and Hamilton.

36
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,950
Sir.

37
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,650
Mr. Northup, these two gentlemen were
inquiring about distinguished individuals,

38
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,850
and I was just this very moment saying
Solomon Northup;

39
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,450
is an expert player on the violin.
- He was indeed.

40
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,350
Mr. Moon is being overly gracious.

41
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:10,450
Taking into consideration
his graciousness and your modesty,

42
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,600
may we trouble you for a moment
of your time to converse, sir?

43
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,250
Of course.

44
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,750
Sir.

45
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,150
A circus?
- That is our usual employee.

46
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,950
The company currently in
the city of Washington.

47
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,200
Circus too constricting
a word to describe the...

48
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,450
talented and merry band
with which we travel.

49
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:28,550
It is a spectacle unlike most
have ever witnessed.

50
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:32,636
Creatures from the darkest Africa
as yet unseen by civilized man.

51
00:09:32,836 --> 00:09:37,200
Acrobats from the Orient contorting
themselves in the most confounding manners.

52
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:41,100
And I myself in aide of Mr. Brown;
an internationally renowned practitioner

53
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,700
...in the art of prestidigitation.

54
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,600
We are on our way thither
to rejoin the company...

55
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,195
having left for a short time to make
a small profit from our own exhibitions.

56
00:09:48,395 --> 00:09:50,184
The reason for our
inquiry with Mr. Moon...

57
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:53,542
Yes. We had just a devil of a time in
procuring music for our entertainments.

58
00:09:53,717 --> 00:09:55,687
Men of true talent seemingly
in short supply.

59
00:09:55,713 --> 00:09:56,525
- Thank you sir...

60
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,900
If we could persuade you to accompany us
as far as Washington...

61
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,500
We would give you one dollar
for each day's service'

62
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,950
and three dollars for every night
played at our performances.

63
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,899
In addition, we would
provide sufficient pay,

64
00:10:06,925 --> 00:10:08,975
for the expenses of your
return here to Saratoga.

65
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:12,250
Two weeks from today.

66
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,550
Welcome to Washington, Solomon.

67
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,850
Thank you.

68
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:23,150
Good Day.

69
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,151
I'm telling you it's too much.
- Some would say that's enough.

70
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,950
Solomon ...

71
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,300
Forty-three dollars.
All to you.

72
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,400
That... it's far more
than my wages amount to.

73
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,350
To our most profitable week.
- Cheers!

74
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:41,950
Cheers!
- Cheers!

75
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,050
Another round.

76
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,750
Umm...

77
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,100
Your generosity ...

78
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,500
is ...extraordinary.
- And your talents are undeniable.

79
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,950
To Solomon!
- Cheers.

80
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,550
Cheers.

81
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,050
What the ...?

82
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,500
That's all right Solomon.

83
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,100
No shame in it.
No shame at all.

84
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,750
Hamilton, we have to hurry.

85
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,700
Bought too many libation.

86
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,100
I'm so sorry.
- Shh... shh

87
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,050
We won't hear it.
We won't.

88
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:39,000
Let him sleep, Hamilton.
- Hm ...

89
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,150
A good night's rest.

90
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,850
And tomorrow...

91
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:46,750
Tomorrow, tomorrow you will feel
as well and refreshed..

92
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,750
As though the earth were new again.

93
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:52,650
Hamilton! There's nothing more
we can do for him.

94
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,200
Such is the pity.

95
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:08,450
Well, my boy,
how yah feel now?

96
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,050
My name...

97
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,400
My name is Solomon Northup.

98
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,550
I am a free man.

99
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,950
A resident of Saratoga, New York.

100
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,550
The residence also of my wife and children
who are equally free.

101
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,700
And you have no right
whatsoever to detain me--

102
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,700
Yah not any free man.
- And I promise you

103
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,700
- I promise you upon my liberation
I will have satisfaction for this wrong.

104
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:35,650
Resolve this.
Produce your papers.

105
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,500
Yah no free man.

106
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,000
And yah ain't from Saratoga.

107
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,100
Yah from Georgia.

108
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,600
Yah ain't a free man.

109
00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:01,250
Yah nuthin' but a Georgia runaway.

110
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,100
Yah a just a..

111
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:09,144
Runaway nigger from Georgia.

112
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:42,500
You're a slave!

113
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,100
Yah a Georgia slave!

114
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,850
Are yah slave?

115
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:07,450
No.

116
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,400
Help me!

117
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,450
Help me!

118
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:16,050
Somebody help me!

119
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,700
That old thing of yours is just
rags and tatters.

120
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,800
Need something proper to wear.

121
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,200
Go'on. Put it on.

122
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,100
There ...

123
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,300
Tha's fine.

124
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,750
Tha's fine.

125
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,050
Got no gratitude?

126
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:23,650
No! It was from my wife.
- Rags and tatters.

127
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:27,150
Rags and tatters.

128
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:39,350
Go on. Warsh up.

129
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:44,250
The boy, too.
Get him clean.

130
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,650
Scrub now.

131
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,500
Do you know when my Mama will come?

132
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,500
Hush him up!
- Mama! Mama!

133
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,900
Quiet! Quiet.
- Mama!

134
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,800
Quiet! - Hush him up!
- Mama!

135
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:59,650
Your mother will come, I swear she will,
but you must be silent.

136
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,150
Be silent!

137
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,800
We need a sympathetic ear.

138
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,700
An opportunity to explain our situation--

139
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,230
Who in your estimation
is that sympathetic ear?

140
00:18:15,256 --> 00:18:16,875
- The two men I journeyed with.

141
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,950
I'm certain they're making inquires
at this very moment.

142
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,496
I would be just as certain
they are counting the money,

143
00:18:20,522 --> 00:18:21,625
paid for delivering
you to this place.

144
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,150
They were not kidnappers.
They were artists.

145
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,500
Fellow performers.
- You know that?

146
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,150
You know for certain who they were?

147
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,600
The reality to come is us
being transported southward.

148
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,300
New Orleans if I were to venture.

149
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,900
After we arrive, we'll be put to market.

150
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,500
And beyond that...

151
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,300
Well, once in a slave state
I suppose there's only one outcome.

152
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:45,900
No.

153
00:18:45,926 --> 00:18:47,925
- I don't say that to give
you empty agitation, John...

154
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,270
For y'all. For y'all they
ain't nothin' but that!

155
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:51,475
But John was'n kidnapped.

156
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:54,050
John bein' hold as debt, tha's all.

157
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,050
Massa pay his debt,
and John be redeemed--

158
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:59,100
Boy, our masters will not come for us.
- Now John's... John's sorry for y'all,

159
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:03,800
but tha's how it be.
Where y'all goin', yah goin' witout John.

160
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,550
Mama!
- Randall.

161
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,550
Mama!

162
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,050
Are you alright?

163
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,750
Come on, get up!

164
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,550
I said get up!
- No, no ...

165
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,750
Now, I don't want to hear yer talk.
Get in the yard.

166
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:27,200
No, I'm not sure...
- Ain't no need for all that.

167
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,750
Just go on a short trip,
That's all.

168
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:33,300
Don't want to frighten the children
none over a li'l boat ride, do yah?

169
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,200
John's massa gunna pay his debt.
John's massa gunna come for him.

170
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,900
I do not want to hear a word,
out of none a yah.

171
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,500
Not a word.

172
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,400
No!

173
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,000
Okay, let's go!

174
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,900
Come on!

175
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,450
Come on child, come on.

176
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,050
Come on, move it!

177
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,300
Come on, come on!
Up, up the stairs.

178
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,150
Hit it!

179
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,750
Come on, let's go.

180
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:28,300
Get up!

181
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,950
Come on, move it!

182
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,250
Okay, let's go!
- Move it boy!

183
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,500
Take him down!

184
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:36,055
Hey, you! Come on, get up!

185
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:39,150
Get down, right there.

186
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,300
Come on.

187
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Right there.
Sit down.

188
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:24,250
Cheer up and don't be so cast down.

189
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:38,650
If you want to survive,
do and say as little as possible.

190
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:41,334
Tell no one who you really are,

191
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,125
and tell no one that you
can read and write.

192
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,000
Unless you want to be a dead nigger.

193
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:07,750
Now, keep your mouth shut.

194
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:15,700
I say we fight.

195
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,050
The crew is fairly small.

196
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,500
If it were well planned,
I believe they could be strong armed.

197
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,450
Three cant stand against a whole crew.

198
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,850
The rest here are niggers,

199
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:29,700
born and bred slaves.
Niggers aint got the stomach for a fight.

200
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,100
Not a damn one.
- All I know,

201
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,950
where we keep travelling
well wish wed died trying.

202
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:43,850
- Survival is not about certain death,
it is about keeping your head down.

203
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:49,100
Days ago I was with my family,

204
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,950
In my home.

205
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:56,050
Now you tell me all is lost.

206
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:02,350
Tell no one who I really am
if I want to survive.

207
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,950
Well, I dont want to survive,

208
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,100
I want to live.

209
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:45,050
Better off.
Better than us.

210
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,750
I do not see it.
Clemens!

211
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:04,850
Clemens Ray!

212
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:07,150
Master Ray, sir!

213
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,450
Who 's in charge here?
- I'm the captain!

214
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,000
I am Mr. Jonas Ray.

215
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,300
My solicitor has documentation verifying..

216
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,450
That the Negro named
Clemens Ray is my property.

217
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:18,000
I know nothing of this arrangement.

218
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,736
You are ordered by court
to return that property,

219
00:25:20,762 --> 00:25:22,975
immediately or be
charged with thievery.

220
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:25,850
Free him!

221
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,950
Master!

222
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,852
Clemens?
Clemens!

223
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,250
Get back!
- Clemens!

224
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,100
Clemens!

225
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,600
Clemens!

226
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,300
Mr. Parker?

227
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,550
Oh, Mr. Northup.

228
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:52,300
Mrs. Northup. Mr. Solomon,
can i interest you with a new cravat?

229
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,250
Pure silk by way of the French.
- We are in need of a fresh carry all..

230
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,600
For the Mrs's travels. Nothing more.

231
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,750
A year's passed?
Off to Sandy Hill?

232
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:03,200
Yes, I am.
- I have just the thing for you.

233
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,877
Something to suit your style,

234
00:27:04,903 --> 00:27:07,675
but sturdy enough for the
forty miles round trip.

235
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,800
It's beautiful.
- But at what price?

236
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,750
We will take it.

237
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:14,300
Children, come see what your father
has just purchased for me.

238
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,700
One moment, sir
and you will be assisted.

239
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,800
Mr. Parker?
- Sir?

240
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,254
If we can talk about
the price ...

241
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,000
- If we could discuss the price;
Forgive me, Mrs. Northup.

242
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:23,100
A customer waits.
Welcome, sir.

243
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,000
Shop well, but mind your wallet.

244
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:29,700
Ignore the gentleman's nonsense.
- Jasper!

245
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,800
My regrets for the intrusion, sir.

246
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,700
- No intrusion.

247
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:40,500
Good day, sir.
- Good day.

248
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,100
Jasper, out!

249
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,100
Very good.

250
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,850
Let's see here ...
Eliza!

251
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,150
Stand up when you hear your name.
Eliza?

252
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:03,050
Lethe!

253
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,850
John!

254
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:09,150
Oren.

255
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,700
Platt!

256
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:16,350
Platt?

257
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,850
Stand up.

258
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:24,050
You fit the description given.
Why didn't you answer when called?

259
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:28,150
- My name is not Platt.
My name is--

260
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,600
Your name is Platt.

261
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,950
Captain, get these niggers
to my carts.

262
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,200
I believe I have something that will
you just like the room behind.

263
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,200
Follow me, please.

264
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,900
Yes.
Now...

265
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,300
Inspect them at your leisure, but ...

266
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,050
I ask you to pay particular regard
to young Ezra right here.

267
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:18,800
Incredibly solid limbs!
I've never seen anything quite like him.

268
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,850
And this marvelous creature ...
Can you believe it? Hm?

269
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,600
So, inspect at your leisure,
Take your time.

270
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,400
Help yourself to refreshments.

271
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:32,200
Gentlemen, what catches your fancy here?

272
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,950
Hm ...? This boy?

273
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:36,400
Open your mouth.
Open, wide up!

274
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,000
Look in there.
Never been sick, a day in his life.

275
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,400
Ah, Mr. Ford?

276
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,800
Splendid, seeing you, sir.
What catches your fancy?

277
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,650
How much for the ones Platt and Eliza?

278
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,650
- Ah, I see ...

279
00:29:55,750 --> 00:30:00,100
A thousand for Platt;
he is a nigger of considerable talent.

280
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,850
I assure you.
Seven hundred for Eliza.

281
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,487
My fairest price.

282
00:30:06,413 --> 00:30:08,331
..You would accept a note?
- Please, sir...

283
00:30:08,357 --> 00:30:11,424
- As always, from you, Mr. Ford.
- Please sir, don't divide my family.

284
00:30:11,424 --> 00:30:13,329
- Don't take me unless you take my children as well.
- Eliza, quiet!

285
00:30:13,355 --> 00:30:15,375
- You will have the most
faithful slave in me,

286
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,600
The most faithful slave
that has ever lived,

287
00:30:17,626 --> 00:30:19,584
but I beg that you do
not separate us..

288
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,650
Please!
- Stop it!

289
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:26,550
Come forward. Come, come..come.
You see how fit the boy is.

290
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,350
Like ripe fruit.

291
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,750
May i take your stick,
for a moment?

292
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:33,450
Observe this, Randall?
Jump, jump, jump...!

293
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:35,950
Very good!
Higher!

294
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,700
He will grow into a fine beast.

295
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,800
How much?
- Six hundred for the boy,

296
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,950
fair and final.

297
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:48,300
Done.

298
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,900
A moment, please.

299
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Mr. Ford?
- Please.

300
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:55,900
Eliza!
- How much for the little girl?

301
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:59,450
You have no need for her.
One so young will bring you no profit.

302
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,250
No, no and no.
I cannot sell the girl.

303
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:05,000
There's heaps 'n piles of
money to be made off her.

304
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,400
She is a beauty.
One of the regular bloods.

305
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,450
None of your thick-lipped, bullet headed,
cotton picking niggers.

306
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,000
Her child, man.

307
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,500
For God's sake,
are you not sentimental in the least?

308
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:21,450
My sentimentality extends
the length of a coin.

309
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:24,950
Do you want the lot, Mr. Ford,
or do you pass on them all?

310
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:28,550
Please, please ...

311
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,450
I will take the ones Platt and Eliza.

312
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:36,374
I will not go without my children.
You will not take them from me.

313
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,600
No, no, no ...!

314
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:18,900
Did you bring all those niggers?

315
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,350
Two of them?

316
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:23,450
You got two?
- Mr. Chapin--

317
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:26,100
This one's cryin'.
Why is this one cryin'?

318
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,500
Separated from her children.
- Oh, dear ...

319
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,950
It couldn't be helped.
- Poor, poor woman.

320
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,300
Mr. Chapin,
- Yes, sir.

321
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,550
Tomorrow you will take these two up
to the mill and start them workin'.

322
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:36,805
For now make them adequate;

323
00:32:36,831 --> 00:32:38,900
fix them a meal, and have
them rest themselves.

324
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:41,000
Yes, sir.

325
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:45,150
C'mon, now. C'mon.
Don't dawdle.

326
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,988
Something to eat and some rest;

327
00:32:48,014 --> 00:32:52,075
your children will soon
enough be forgotten.

328
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,800
For all of you rotten niggers that
do not know, My name is John Tibeats,

329
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,600
William Ford's chief carpenter.

330
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:27,100
You will refer to me as Master.

331
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,000
Now, Mister Chapin is the overseer on
this plantation.

332
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:34,100
...and You too will refer to him...

333
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,750
as Master.

334
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:39,450
So, clap your hands.

335
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:44,200
Like this.

336
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,400
Come on.
Come on now.

337
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,300
Clap your hands.

338
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,350
<i>Nigger run nigger flew</i>

339
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,950
<i>Nigger tore his shirt in two.</i>

340
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:59,350
<i>Run run the pattyroller will get you.</i>

341
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:03,450
<i>Run nigger run well you better get away</i>

342
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:09,000
That's right.

343
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,350
<i>Nigger run, run so fast</i>

344
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,750
<i>Stoved his head in a hornets nest</i>

345
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:16,200
<i>Run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you</i>

346
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,500
<i>Run nigger run well you better get away</i>

347
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,000
<i>Run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you</i>

348
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:25,600
<i>Run nigger run well you better get away</i>

349
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,450
<i>Some folks say a nigger won't steal</i>

350
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,800
<i>I caught three in my corn field</i>

351
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,100
<i>One has a bushel? And one has a peck</i>

352
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,550
<i>One had a rope and it was hung around his neck</i>

353
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:38,000
<i>Run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you</i>

354
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,500
<i>Run nigger run well you better get away</i>

355
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,900
<i>Run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you</i>

356
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,800
<i>Run nigger run well you better get away</i>

357
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,300
<i>Hey Mr. Pattyroller don't catch me</i>

358
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,700
<i>Catch that nigger behind that tree</i>

359
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,200
<i>Run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you?</i>

360
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,500
<i>Run nigger run well you better get away</i>

361
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,850
<i>Run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you?</i>

362
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:00,100
<i>Run nigger run well you better get away</i>

363
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:11,300
I am the God of Abraham,
and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

364
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:16,850
And when the multitude heard this,
they were astonished at his doctrine.

365
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:19,950
Then one of them, which was a lawyer,

366
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:23,500
asked him a question,
tempting him,

367
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:22,000
The creek is plenty deep enough to sail,

368
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,300
even with a boat full of load.

369
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,750
The distance from the WORK AREA
to the point on the latter bayou

370
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,750
...is several miles by water fewer than land.

371
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,000
It occurs to me that the expense
of the transportation would be materially diminished--

372
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:35,300
"Materially diminished?"
- If we use the waterway.

373
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,200
Are you an engineer or a nigger?

374
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,700
Are you an engineer or nigger?

375
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,700
Let the man say his piece.
- It's a scheme.

376
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,100
Plenty of engineers have schemed similarly.
The passes are too tight.

377
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,450
I reckon them at more than
twelve feet at their most narrow.

378
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:58,700
Wide enough for a tub to traverse.
A team of niggers can clear it out.

379
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,500
And you know what of transport and terra formin'?

380
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,900
I labored repairing the Champlain canal,

381
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:06,900
on the section over which
William Van Nortwick was superintendent.

382
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,950
With my earnings I hired several
efficient hands to assist me,

383
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:12,900
...and I entered into contracts for the transportation
of large rafts of timber from..

384
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,200
Lake Champlain to Troy.

385
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:22,150
I'll admit to being impressed even if you won't.

386
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:26,750
Collect a team, see what good you can do.

387
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,700
Well, I'm happy.
You are a model.

388
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,900
What took you so long?

389
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,750
Thank you, Master Ford.
- No, thank you.

390
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:25,250
Yeah!

391
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Hello, Mr. Platt.

392
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,300
My great thanks, Master Ford.

393
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,600
My thanks to you,

394
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,950
and it is the least of it.

395
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:12,050
My hope is that it brings us both
much joy over the years.

396
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:49,750
Eliza.

397
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,150
Eliza.

398
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,650
Stop!

399
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:00,200
Stop your wailing!

400
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,350
You let yourself be overcome by sorrow.
You will drown in it.

401
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:07,800
Have you stopped crying for your children?

402
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:13,300
You make no sounds,
but will you ever let them go in your heart?

403
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:20,250
...They are as my flesh...
- Then who is distressed?

404
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:22,700
Do I upset the Master and the Mistress?

405
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,300
Do you care less for my loss
than their well being?

406
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,050
Master Ford is a decent man.
- He is a slaver!

407
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:31,200
Under the circumstances--
- Under the circumstances he is a slaver!

408
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,000
But you truckle at his boot--
- No.

409
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,950
You luxuriate in his favor.
- I survive!

410
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:39,000
I will not fall into despair!

411
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,200
I will offer up my talents to Master Ford.

412
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,950
I will keep myself hearty until freedom is opportune!

413
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,900
- Ford is your opportunity.

414
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Do you think he does not know that
you are more than you suggest?

415
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:53,600
But he does nothing for you.
Nothing.

416
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,500
You are no better than prized livestock.

417
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,700
Call for him. Call, tell him of your previous
circumstances;

418
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:04,550
and see what it earns you... Solomon.

419
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,500
So, youve settled into your role
as Platt, then?

420
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,000
My back is thick with scars from..

421
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,650
Protesting my freedom.

422
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:19,500
Do not accuse me..
- I accuse you of nothing.

423
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,650
I cannot accuse.

424
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:24,650
I have done so many,
many dishonorable things to survive.

425
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:28,200
And for all of them I have ended up here...

426
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:31,900
No better than if I had stood up for myself.

427
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,350
God forgive me.

428
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:39,450
Solomon, let me weep for my children.

429
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:52,400
<i>Who so ever yherefore, shall humbles himself,
as this little child,</i>

430
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:56,300
<i>the same is greatest in the Kingdom of heaven.</i>

431
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,800
<i>And whoso shall receive...</i>

432
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,500
<i>one such little child in my name
receiveth me.</i>

433
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,250
I cannot have that kind of depression about.

434
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:07,400
<i>But whoso shall offend one of these little ones
which believe in me, it were better for him</i>

435
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:14,550
<i>that a millstone were hanged about his neck,
and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.</i>

436
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:19,050
<i>Amen.
- AMEN!</i>

437
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:32,650
Make them boards flush.

438
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:36,550
They are, sir.
- No, They is no such thing.

439
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:42,200
As smooth to the touch as a yearling's coat.

440
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:46,600
Callin' me a liar, boy?

441
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:50,850
Only a matter of perspective, sir.

442
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:54,600
From where you stand you may see differently.
But the hands are not mistaken.

443
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:59,700
I simply ask that you use all your senses
before rendering judgement.

444
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:05,100
Oh ... my ...You are a brute.

445
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:11,200
You are a dog,
and no better for followin' instruction.

446
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:13,850
I'll do as ordered, sir.
- Then you'll be up at daybreak.

447
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:16,850
You will procure
a keg of nails from Chapin;

448
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:20,950
...and commence puttin' on clapboards.
- Yes, sir.

449
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:29,200
Make them boards flush.

450
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,700
Where am i going, sir?

451
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,700
Solomon!
Solomon!

452
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:50,100
Solomon!

453
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,400
Solomon!

454
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:05,000
When I say I had my master's favor,
you understand.

455
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:11,050
And for nine years
he blessed me with every comfort and luxury in life.

456
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:13,600
Silks and jewels and even...

457
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:17,200
servants to wait upon us.

458
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:20,750
Such was our life,

459
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:25,050
and the life of this beautiful girl I bore for him.

460
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,800
But Master Berry's daughter...

461
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:33,400
she always looked at me with an unkind nature.

462
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:38,700
She hated Emily no matter she and Emily
were flesh of flesh.

463
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:44,350
As Master Berry's health failed,
she gained power in the household and;

464
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:47,000
Eventually, I was brought to the city
on the false pretense...

465
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:51,100
of our free papers being executed.

466
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,500
My poor children.

467
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:38,850
I thought I told you to commence
puttin' on clapboards.

468
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:42,900
Yes, master.
I am about it. These have all been replaced.

469
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,250
Didn't I tell yah last night to get a keg of nails?

470
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:47,700
And so I did;

471
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:52,950
Goddamn you!
I thought you knowed somethin'!

472
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:54,600
I did as instructed.

473
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:58,300
If there's something wrong,
then its wrong with your instructions.

474
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,850
You, black bastard!

475
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:02,600
You ...

476
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:04,300
Goddamn ...

477
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,900
black bastard!
Strip yer clothes!

478
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,350
Strip!

479
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:14,950
I will not!

480
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,800
You ...

481
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,100
Yew will not live..

482
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,200
To see another day, nigger!

483
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:31,900
God, help!

484
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,100
Monster!

485
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,100
Help! Somebody help me!
Help!

486
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,600
Help! Somebody

487
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,700
Help!

488
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,900
Help me!

489
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,901
What is the matter?

490
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,150
What is the matter?
- Master..

491
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:56,850
Master Tibeats wants to whip me
for using the nails you gave me.

492
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:59,500
This ain't done by half.

493
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,800
I will have flesh,

494
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:05,700
and I will have all of it.

495
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,300
Do not stir.

496
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:13,500
Do not attempt to leave the plantation.
But if you run there is no protecting you.

497
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,200
Stay here.

498
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:24,950
Gentlemen? Whoever moves that
nigger is adead man.

499
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:27,900
I am overseer of this plantation,

500
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,050
William Ford holds a mortgage on Platt.

501
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:34,050
If you hang him, he loses his debt.

502
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:36,950
You have no claim to his life.

503
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:38,850
As for you two ...

504
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:41,950
if you have any regard for your own safety...

505
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:46,050
I say, begone!

506
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:48,300
You got no cause.

507
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,050
Platt is mine, and mine to do
with as I please.

508
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:55,650
If you touch him..

509
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,850
Sam! Get the mule.

510
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:25,950
Get Master Ford.

511
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,850
I believe Tibeats is skulkin' about the premises somewhere.
He wants you dead,

512
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:56,750
and he will attempt to have you so.

513
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:59,250
It's no longer safe for you here.

514
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:03,200
And I don't believe you will remain
passive if Tibeats attacks.

515
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:06,400
I have transferred my debt to Edwin Epps.

516
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:10,500
He will take charge of you.

517
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:31,750
Master Ford?

518
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,200
You must know that I am not a slave.

519
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:39,400
I cannot hear that.
- Before, I came to you I was a freeman.

520
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,700
I am trying to save your life!

521
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:48,200
And... I have a debt to be mindful of.

522
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,400
That, now, is to Edwin Epps.

523
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:53,400
He is a hard man.
Prides himself on being a "nigger breaker."

524
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:57,050
But truthfully, I could find no others
who would have you.

525
00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:00,150
You've made a reputation of yourself.

526
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:06,350
Whatever your circumstances,
you are an exceptional nigger, Platt.

527
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:11,050
I fear no good will come of it.

528
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:35,800
<i>"And that servant..</i>

529
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:39,700
<i>Which knew his Lord's will...</i>

530
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:43,800
WHICH KNEW HIS LORD'S WILL;

531
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:51,450
<i>and prepared not himself...</i>

532
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:55,650
PREPARED NOT HIMSELF,

533
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:02,050
<i>neither did according to his will,</i>

534
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:07,300
<i>shall be beaten with many stripes...</i>

535
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,500
D'ye hear that?

536
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,000
"Stripes."

537
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:14,200
That nigger that don't obey his lord -

538
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:17,050
that's his master - d'ye see?

539
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:22,950
- That 'ere nigger shall be beaten
with many stripes.

540
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:27,550
Now, "many" signifies a great many.

541
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:29,550
Forty, a hundred,

542
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:33,650
a hundred and fifty lashes...

543
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,600
That's Scripter!

544
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:55,900
Pick that cotton.

545
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,200
Move along now!

546
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:02,000
Come on now!

547
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:04,700
Drive dem niggers.
- Pick that cotton.

548
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,750
Move along now,

549
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,400

550
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:10,650
Come on!

551
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,400
Two hundred forty pounds for Bob.

552
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:16,600
What yah got for James?

553
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:18,950
Two hundred ninety five pounds.

554
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:22,650
Tha's real good, boy.
Tha's real good.

555
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:26,250
One hundred eighty two pounds for Platt.

556
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:29,350
How much can even
an average nigger pick a day?

557
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:34,400
Two hundred pounds.
- This nigger ain't even average.

558
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,850
Five hundred twelve pounds for Patsey.

559
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:40,150
Five hundred twelve.

560
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:46,000
Yah men folk got no shame
lettin' Patsey out pick yah?

561
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:51,400
The day ain't yet come
she swung lower than five hundred pounds.

562
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:55,600
Queen of the fields, she is.

563
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:59,250
138 pounds ...
- I ain't done, Treach.

564
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:03,350
Ain't I owed a minute to luxuriate
on the work Patsey done?

565
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:05,850
Yes, sir.

566
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:11,700
Damned Queen.

567
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:16,350
Born and bred to the field.

568
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:19,650
A nigger among niggers,

569
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:23,700
and God give 'er to me.

570
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,000
A lesson in the rewards of righteous livin'.

571
00:57:31,850 --> 00:57:35,050
All be observant ta that.

572
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:37,650
All!

573
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:41,150

Now speak.

574
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:44,750
One hundred thirty eight pounds for Phebe.

575
00:57:44,850 --> 00:57:48,700
Hit one forty five yesterday.
Pull her out.

576
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,150
Two hundred six pounds for George.

577
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:53,850
How much he pick yesterday?

578
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,850
Two twenty nine.
- Not enought.

579
00:57:56,950 --> 00:58:00,350
Come on, kid.

580
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:05,050
Come on.
- Come on, boy, move!

581
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:54,800
Get up! Tonight we dance!
Get up!

582
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:56,350
Bring your fiddle, Platt!
Go!

583
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,550
Come on!

584
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:01,650
Come on, Platt!
Come on!

585
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:15,650
Come on! Where's yah merriment?
Move yer feet.

586
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,450
Sell her!
- What's all this?

587
01:00:31,550 --> 01:00:34,200
You will sell the negress!

588
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:36,200
Sell little Pats?

589
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:39,300
She pick with more vigor
than any other nigger!

590
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,950
Choose another ta go.
- No other.

591
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:43,800
Sell her!

592
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:46,300
I will not!

593
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:53,400
You will remove that black bitch from this property,
'er I'll take myself back to Cheneyville.

594
01:00:56,300 --> 01:01:00,500
Back to that hog's trough
where I found you?

595
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:07,550
Do not set yourself up against Patsey, my dear.

596
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:16,150
'Cause I will rid myself of yah well
before I do away with her!

597
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,800
Whatcha looking at?

598
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:26,300
That damned woman!

599
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,800
I won't have my mood spoiled.

600
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:32,000
I will not.

601
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:33,700
Dance!

602
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:36,400
Dance, i said!

603
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,000
Come on!

604
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:45,900
Pick it up, Platt.
Play that thing, boy!

605
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:23,700
Platt?

606
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:26,400
Yes, Mistress.

607
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:30,400
Can you find your way
to Bartholomew's?

608
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:32,150
I can, ma'am.

609
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:38,100
This is a list of goods and sundries.
You will take it to be filled and return immediately.

610
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:40,000
Take your tag.

611
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:44,900
Tell Bartholomew to add it to our debt.
- Yes, Mistress.

612
01:02:45,250 --> 01:02:48,250
Where yah from, Platt?

613
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:53,100
I have told you.
- Tell me again.

614
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,200
Washington.
- Who were yah Master?

615
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:59,100
Master's name was Freeman.
- Was he a learned man?

616
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:04,250
I suppose so.
- He learn yah ta read?

617
01:03:04,350 --> 01:03:06,950
A word here or there,

618
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:11,100
but I have no understanding of the written text.
- Don't trouble yer self with it.

619
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:15,800
Same as the rest, Master bought yah to work.
Tha's all.

620
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:20,100
And any more'll earn yah a hun'red lashes.

621
01:04:24,550 --> 01:04:27,550
Come here, boy.

622
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,900
Come on.

623
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,050
Where are you going, boy?
- On my way to...

624
01:04:49,150 --> 01:04:53,650
Bartholomew...
Sent by Mistress Epps.

625
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:59,550
You best get to then.

626
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:02,850
Get that quick.

627
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:53,000
Any trouble?
- No, ma'am.

628
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:55,600
No trouble.

629
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:55,950
Platt Epps, good Sunday morning.
- Good morning, Master Shaw.

630
01:06:56,050 --> 01:06:58,650
I've been sent by Master to retrieve Patsey.
May I approach?

631
01:06:58,750 --> 01:07:01,250
You may.

632
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:12,400
Excuse me, Mistress Shaw.

633
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:15,750
Nigger Platt.
- Patsey, Master wishes you to return.

634
01:07:15,850 --> 01:07:17,800
Sabbath day.
I's free ta roam.

635
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:20,800
But the Master sent me running to fetch you,
and said no time should be wasted.

636
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:24,700
Do you drink tea?
- Thank you, Mistress, but I don't dare.

637
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:30,700
Would you knowed Massa Epps's consternation
to be any lessened wit your timely return?

638
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:33,050
Is not it his constant condition?

639
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:38,150
Sit. Sit and drink the tea that offered.

640
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:45,900
What'n was Epps's concern?

641
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,050
...I'd rather not say...

642
01:07:48,150 --> 01:07:50,600
L'il gossip on the Sabbath be fine.

643
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:53,950
All things in moderation.

644
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:57,900
As you are aware, Master Epps...

645
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,500
can be a man of a hard countenance.

646
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:04,800
You know he has ill feelings toward your husband.

647
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:06,950
He do.

648
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:09,100
Master Epps has somehow come to believe,

649
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,800
that Master Shaw is...

650
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:14,700
is something of a lothario.

651
01:08:14,950 --> 01:08:17,400
A misguided belief, no doubt.

652
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:23,000
No doubt...
if not born outta truth itself.

653
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,200
I meant no disrespect.

654
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:27,250
He ain't heard you.

655
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:31,850
I meant no disrespect to you, Mistress.

656
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:36,850
Ha! Got no cause to worry for my sensibilities.

657
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:41,600
I ain't felt the end of a lash in
'mo years than I cain recall.

658
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:44,350
Ain't worked a field, neither.

659
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:49,850
Where one time I served,
now I got others servin' me.

660
01:08:49,950 --> 01:08:55,900
The cost to my current
existence be Massa Shaw..

661
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,950
Broadcasting his affections,
'n me enjoyin' his pantomime of fidelity.

662
01:09:00,050 --> 01:09:04,900
If that what keep me from
the cotton pickin' niggers, that what it be.

663
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:10,000
A small and reasonable price to be paid 'fo sure.

664
01:09:12,850 --> 01:09:19,150
I knowed what it like to be the object
of Massa's predilections and peculiarities.

665
01:09:19,350 --> 01:09:22,000
A lusty visit in the night,

666
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:24,900
or a visitation from the whip.

667
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,750
And you take comfort, Patsey;

668
01:09:27,850 --> 01:09:30,150
the Good Lord will manage Epps.

669
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:35,150
In His own time the Good Lord will manage dem all.

670
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:43,250
...the curse on the Pharos is a poor example
of all that wait 'fo the plantation class.

671
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:50,100
This is nice.

672
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:02,100
Patsy?

673
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,900
Patsey!
- Do not look in his direction. Continue on.

674
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,150
Patsey...!
- Found her, Master,

675
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:11,050
and brought her back just as instructed.

676
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:14,400
What'd you jus now tell her?

677
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:17,150
What'd you say to Pats?

678
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:20,650
No words were spoken.
None of consequence.

679
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:25,300
Lie! Damned liar!

680
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:28,450
Saw you talkin' with 'er.

681
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:31,050
Tell me!

682
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:33,800
I cannot speak of what did not occur.

683
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:37,300
I'll cut your black throat.
- Master...

684
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,500
You come here!
- Master, i brought her back...

685
01:10:39,550 --> 01:10:43,050
I said come here!
- I brought her back, just like you ...

686
01:10:43,150 --> 01:10:46,700
Come here!
- Come on, let's go!

687
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:53,400
I got her, just as instructed.

688
01:10:55,450 --> 01:10:58,450
Stay away from Patsy, boy!

689
01:11:31,150 --> 01:11:34,500
It's the Lord's day.

690
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:38,800
Ain't nothin' Christian in us carryin' on like this.

691
01:11:44,450 --> 01:11:47,450
I concede to yah,

692
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:51,350
but in the name of valor,

693
01:11:51,450 --> 01:11:54,950
help yer master to his feet.

694
01:11:58,950 --> 01:12:00,450
Wha's the fuss?

695
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:04,150
Master Epps believed Patsey and me
to be in conversation when we were not.

696
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:05,700
I tried to explain, but it lead to all this.

697
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:07,251
What is it? Ya cain't remain the Sabbath
without her under your eye?

698
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:11,650
Hold on...
- Ya are a no-account bastard.

699
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:13,850
A filthy, godless heathen.

700
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:16,650
My bed is too holy for yah ta share.

701
01:12:16,750 --> 01:12:19,050
Wha's he been tellin' yah?
- Of yer misbegotten ways.

702
01:12:19,150 --> 01:12:22,500
And he would know what of anythin'?

703
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:25,250
I ain't even spoken with him today.

704
01:12:25,350 --> 01:12:27,650
Yah lyin' nigger, Platt.

705
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:30,750
Have I?

706
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:33,700
Have I?

707
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:38,350
There; there's all the truth he got.

708
01:12:38,450 --> 01:12:41,450
Damned nigger.

709
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:34,500
Patsy?

710
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:33,900
A moment from the dancing.

711
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,100
Come sample what I baked for y'all.

712
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:37,850
Thank you, mistress.
- Thank you, mistress.

713
01:16:37,950 --> 01:16:39,550
Thank you, Mistress!
- Thank you, Mistress!

714
01:16:39,650 --> 01:16:43,150
Thank you, mistress.
- There'll be none for you, Patsey.

715
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:45,700
Yah see that?

716
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:49,300
Did yah see the
look of insolence she give me?

717
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:53,250
Seen nothin' but her turn away.
- Are you blind or ignorant?

718
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:55,650
It was hot, hateful scorn.

719
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:58,400
It filled that black face.

720
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:01,850
Yah tell me yah did'n see it, then yah choose not to look,

721
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:03,950
or yah sayin' I lie.

722
01:17:04,050 --> 01:17:06,850
Whatever it was, it passed.

723
01:17:06,950 --> 01:17:10,300
Is that how yah are with the niggers?

724
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:14,150
Let every ill thought fester inside 'em.

725
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:15,800
Look at them.

726
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:18,100
They foul with it;

727
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:20,750
They foul with their hate.

728
01:17:20,850 --> 01:17:25,150
You let it be,
it'll come back to us in the dark a night.

729
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:27,300
Yah want that?

730
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:33,300
Yah want them black animals to leave us
gut like pigs in our own sleep?

731
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,050
No...

732
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:38,500
You are manless.

733
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:41,800
A damned eunuch if ever there was.

734
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:45,650
And if yah won't stand for me,
I'd pray you'd at least be a credit to yer own kind..

735
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:50,300
And beat every foul thought from 'em.

736
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:01,800
Beat it from 'em!

737
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,550
Eat!

738
01:18:18,650 --> 01:18:20,900
Fill yourselves.

739
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,000
...And
then we dance.

740
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:30,700
I said, eat!

741
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:47,850
Platt...

742
01:18:47,950 --> 01:18:51,750
Platt, you awake?

743
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:54,900
I am.

744
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:57,900
I have a request.

745
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,800
An act of kindness.

746
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:06,450
I secreted it from the Mistress.

747
01:19:07,750 --> 01:19:10,950
Return it!
- It yours, Platt.

748
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:13,300
For what cause?

749
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:16,000
All I ask:

750
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:18,750
end my life.

751
01:19:18,850 --> 01:19:22,200
Take my body to the margin of the swamp--

752
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:25,300
Take me by the throat.
Hold me low in the water...

753
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:28,500
until I's still 'n without life.

754
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:33,500
Bury me in a lonely place of dyin'.
- I will do no such thing.

755
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:39,200
The... the gory detail with which you speak--
- I thought on it long and hard.

756
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:41,900
It is melancholia,

757
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,550
...nothing more.

758
01:19:44,650 --> 01:19:47,550
How can you fall into such despair?

759
01:19:47,650 --> 01:19:51,150
How can you not know?

760
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:57,900
I got no comfort in this life.

761
01:19:58,950 --> 01:20:05,350
If I cain't buy mercy from yah,
I'll beg it.

762
01:20:05,450 --> 01:20:08,150
There are others.

763
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:11,300
<i>Beg them.
- I'm begging you! - <font color=#1191CE>Why?</font></i>

764
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:15,400
Why would you consign me to damnation
with such an un-Godly request?

765
01:20:15,450 --> 01:20:18,150
- There is God here!

766
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:21,750
God is merciful...

767
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:24,850
...and He forgive merciful acts.

768
01:20:24,950 --> 01:20:28,150
Won't be no hell for you.

769
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:31,450
Do it.

770
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:40,300
Do what I ain't got the strength ta do myself.

771
01:21:18,250 --> 01:21:20,900
It is a plague.

772
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:26,200
Cotton worm.
- A plague! It's damn Biblical.

773
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:30,800
Two season God done sent a plague to smite me.

774
01:21:31,550 --> 01:21:35,750
What I done that God hate me so?

775
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:44,100
It's that Godless lot.

776
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:46,050
They brought this on me.

777
01:21:47,150 --> 01:21:53,150
I bring 'em God's word,
and heathens they are, they brung me God's scorn.

778
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:57,350
Damn you!

779
01:21:57,450 --> 01:21:59,700
Damn you!

780
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:02,600
Damn all, you'all!

781
01:22:29,050 --> 01:22:32,550
Judge?
- Mr. Epps.

782
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:38,050
I am deeply sadden to hear
about your misfortune.

783
01:22:42,250 --> 01:22:43,700
Listen up.

784
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:46,050
Yer Judge Turner's for the season.
More if need be,

785
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:48,250
...until my crop return.

786
01:22:48,350 --> 01:22:50,800
Yah'll bring no disrespect to me,

787
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:53,900
and yah'll bring no biblical plagues to him.
You hear?

788
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,850
Or I'll take all your skin.

789
01:22:56,950 --> 01:23:00,150
Get out.

790
01:23:50,350 --> 01:23:54,350
Get off the porch!?
Get off the porch!

791
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:02,200
Platt is it?

792
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:06,800
Yes, sir.
- Have you cultivated cane previously?

793
01:24:06,950 --> 01:24:10,550
No, sir. I am not.
- You take to it quite naturally.

794
01:24:10,650 --> 01:24:12,550
Are you educated?
- No, sir.

795
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:16,400
Niggers are hired to work,
not to read and write.

796
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:20,400
You play the fiddle?
- Yes, sir.

797
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:22,550
Yes, I do.

798
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:28,650
Willard Yarney, a planter up the bayou,
celebrates his anniversary in a three week's time.

799
01:24:28,750 --> 01:24:31,100
I will hold out your name to him.

800
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:34,200
What you earn is yours to keep.

801
01:24:34,350 --> 01:24:36,000
Yes, sir.

802
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:39,300
Mind yourself, Platt.

803
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:56,750
Woooo!

804
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:03,800
Joyous day it is?

805
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:06,400
Joyous day?

806
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:08,900
Dark times is behind us.

807
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:13,500
Clean livin' 'n prayer
done lifted the plague.

808
01:27:14,150 --> 01:27:18,950
As thick 'n white as New England snow.

809
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:22,900
'N now my niggers is returned to me.

810
01:27:26,150 --> 01:27:29,350
Heard Judge Turner gave you favor.

811
01:27:33,050 --> 01:27:35,100
Oh, did you beguile him, Platt,

812
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:38,200
with your slick nigger ways?

813
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:43,250
Well, yah won't stand idle, boy.

814
01:27:43,350 --> 01:27:46,150
Not on my land.

815
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:51,100
Much work to do.

816
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,050
Days of old long since, eh?

817
01:27:54,150 --> 01:27:56,800
Huh?

818
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:06,065
Joyous! Joyous indeed!

819
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:11,350
Let's go find something sweet for you. Hmm?

820
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:16,500
Candy.
- Candy?

821
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:46,600
George?
- 180 pounds.

822
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:50,600
Patsey?
- Five hundred twenty pounds for Patsey.

823
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:53,800
Tha's my girl.
Don't never let me down.

824
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:58,400
Platt?
- One hundred sixty pounds.

825
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:01,250
Armsby?

826
01:29:01,350 --> 01:29:04,350
Sixty four pounds.

827
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:10,350
A good days labor would average two hundred pounds.

828
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:13,400
Yes, sir.

829
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:19,400
I'm sure in time y'll develope as a picker,

830
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:22,500
but it takes effort, boy.

831
01:29:22,950 --> 01:29:25,900
Put some damn effort into it.
- Yes, sir.

832
01:29:25,950 --> 01:29:29,750
Take 'em out.
Get to whippin'.

833
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:37,750
It's a tragedy.

834
01:29:37,850 --> 01:29:40,500
How does such come to pass?

835
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:44,300
Working a field and picking cotton like a lowly hand.

836
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:47,650
I'm of a damn sight better station.

837
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:49,800
I've worked as an overseer, you know.

838
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:53,600
I did not know, sir.
- Not "sir."

839
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:56,450
Just Armsby.

840
01:29:56,550 --> 01:29:58,750
Not owed more than any other in the field.

841
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:02,050
How did you get in that position,
if I may ask?

842
01:30:02,150 --> 01:30:06,150
Ask. It's just conversation.

843
01:30:06,850 --> 01:30:10,050
I became a little too dependant on the whisky,

844
01:30:10,150 --> 01:30:13,350
a little too undependable on the job.

845
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:16,550
Before you say I'm just a sorry drunkard,

846
01:30:16,650 --> 01:30:19,150
...let me state my case:

847
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:21,900
As reliable employment as overseeing is,

848
01:30:21,950 --> 01:30:24,850
...it's no easy chore on the spirit.

849
01:30:24,950 --> 01:30:27,850
I say no man of conscious;

850
01:30:27,950 --> 01:30:33,719
can take the lash to another human day in,
and day out without shredding at his own self.

851
01:30:33,919 --> 01:30:36,200
Takes him to a place...

852
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:41,150
where he either makes excuses
within his mind to be unaffected...

853
01:30:41,250 --> 01:30:45,400
Or finds some way to trample his guilty sensations.

854
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:47,200
Well, I trampled.

855
01:30:47,300 --> 01:30:50,300
And with frequency.

856
01:30:50,650 --> 01:30:56,950
I gave in to tales of wealth and prosperity;

857
01:30:57,050 --> 01:31:01,950
But such profitable outcomes are reserved
for the plantation masters.

858
01:31:02,050 --> 01:31:06,250
It's the lot of the rest of us to serve.

859
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,055
Now, I want nothing more
than to earn a decent wage..

860
01:31:10,150 --> 01:31:13,350
And get myself home.

861
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:47,350
The proceeds of my fiddling performances.

862
01:31:47,450 --> 01:31:49,700
A few picayunes,

863
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:52,000
but all I have in the world.

864
01:31:52,100 --> 01:31:55,700
I promise them to you
if you will do me the favor I require.

865
01:31:55,800 --> 01:32:00,800
But I beg you not to expose me
if you cannot grant the request.

866
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:02,750
What..

867
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:06,750
What is it that you ask?
- First, your word, sir.

868
01:32:06,850 --> 01:32:09,350
On my honor.

869
01:32:09,850 --> 01:32:12,850
It is a simple enough request.

870
01:32:13,350 --> 01:32:17,150
I only that you deposit a letter
in the post office in Marksville.

871
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:22,200
And that you keep the action
an inviolable secret forever.

872
01:32:23,950 --> 01:32:28,150
A patron is what I require, sir.

873
01:32:32,900 --> 01:32:34,600
I'll do it.

874
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:38,300
And will accept whatever payment is offered.

875
01:32:39,950 --> 01:32:43,150
To assist you, I put my own self at risk.

876
01:32:43,250 --> 01:32:45,200
I will do so,

877
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:49,400
but fair compensation is all I ask.

878
01:32:57,950 --> 01:32:59,950
Draw up your letter.

879
01:33:00,050 --> 01:33:04,100
We will meet again.
In two days?

880
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:06,700
In two days.

881
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:11,800
...Thank you.

882
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:29,700
Well, boy.

883
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:32,750
I understand I've got a learned nigger

884
01:34:32,850 --> 01:34:35,600
that writes letters..

885
01:34:35,700 --> 01:34:39,300
And tries to get white fellows to mail 'em.

886
01:34:45,050 --> 01:34:47,800
Well, Armsby tol' me today...

887
01:34:47,900 --> 01:34:51,400
the devil was among my niggers.

888
01:34:52,050 --> 01:34:55,150
That I had one that needed close watchin'

889
01:34:55,250 --> 01:34:58,050
or he would run away.

890
01:34:59,450 --> 01:35:02,200
When I asked him, "Why?" ...

891
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:05,700
He said you come over to him...

892
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:08,750
and waked him up in the middle of the night,

893
01:35:08,850 --> 01:35:12,600
and wanted him to carry a letter...

894
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:16,600
...to Marksville.

895
01:35:20,700 --> 01:35:24,200
What have yah got to say to that?

896
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:28,500
There is no truth in it.

897
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:31,100
You say.

898
01:35:31,650 --> 01:35:35,150
How could I write a letter without ink or paper?

899
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:39,750
Who am i going to write a letter.
There is no friends living as I know of.

900
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:43,250
That Armsby...

901
01:35:43,350 --> 01:35:48,150
That Armsby is a lying drunken fellow.

902
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:52,800
Didn't he want you to hire him for an overseer?

903
01:35:53,550 --> 01:35:56,400
That's it.

904
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:58,550
He wants to make you believe
we're all going to run away..

905
01:35:58,650 --> 01:36:02,550
And so, you'll hire an overseer to watch us.

906
01:36:02,650 --> 01:36:05,800
He believes you are soft soap.

907
01:36:05,900 --> 01:36:09,200
He's given to such talk.

908
01:36:09,300 --> 01:36:13,500
Made this story a lie, out of whole cloth,

909
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:17,100
'cause he wants to get a situation.

910
01:36:21,300 --> 01:36:24,800
It's all a lie, master,

911
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:32,200
It's all a lie.

912
01:36:39,350 --> 01:36:42,350
I'll be damned.

913
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:52,250
Were he not free and white, Platt.

914
01:36:52,350 --> 01:36:56,150
Were he not free and white.

915
01:38:25,750 --> 01:38:28,600
Edward?
Give him water!

916
01:39:12,700 --> 01:39:14,800
I just want to say something ...

917
01:39:14,900 --> 01:39:17,900
'bout Uncle Abram.

918
01:39:20,550 --> 01:39:23,100
He was a good man..

919
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:26,700
...and always looked out for us,
ever since we were little.

920
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,200
God loved him.

921
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:32,800
God has blessed
God keep him.

922
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,500
Amen.

923
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:02,900
Wait till the end.

924
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:12,850
Hey, Bass?

925
01:42:12,950 --> 01:42:14,400
No, no, no ...

926
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:17,150
No shame in taking respite from the heat;

927
01:42:17,250 --> 01:42:18,950
drink, shade.

928
01:42:19,050 --> 01:42:23,150
It's ungodly for travelers.
Hearty, or otherwise.

929
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:30,100
What's funny?
- Epps, I'm here to complete the work at hand.

930
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:33,500
As requested
and as paid for.

931
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:35,700
Something rubs you wrongly.

932
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:37,500
I offer you the opportunity to speak off.

933
01:42:42,300 --> 01:42:44,869
Well you ask plainly,
so I well tell you plainly.

934
01:42:45,546 --> 01:42:47,575
What amused me just then, was..

935
01:42:47,701 --> 01:42:49,970
..Your concern for my
well being in this heat.

936
01:42:50,196 --> 01:42:51,538
When quite frankly..

937
01:42:51,664 --> 01:42:53,047
..The conditions of your labours..

938
01:42:53,073 --> 01:42:54,899
- The condition of my labour?
- It is hard!

939
01:42:54,925 --> 01:42:58,125
- What the hell?
- It's all wrong..all wrong, mr Epps.

940
01:42:58,126 --> 01:42:59,942
They ain't hired help.

941
01:43:00,568 --> 01:43:01,609
There my property.

942
01:43:02,335 --> 01:43:05,170
- You say that with pride.
- I say it as fact.

943
01:43:07,496 --> 01:43:10,505
This conversation concerns
what is fact and what's not.

944
01:43:10,931 --> 01:43:12,866
Then it must be said.

945
01:43:12,892 --> 01:43:16,101
That there is no justice,
or righteous in this slavery.

946
01:43:17,027 --> 01:43:19,209
But you do open up a interesting question..

947
01:43:20,035 --> 01:43:21,943
What right have you too your niggers?..

948
01:43:22,069 --> 01:43:24,521
..When you come down to the point?
- What right?

949
01:43:25,647 --> 01:43:28,272
I bought them, I paid for them.

950
01:43:28,998 --> 01:43:32,249
Of course you did, and the.. Law say's
you have the right to hold a nigger.

951
01:43:32,375 --> 01:43:34,713
But begging the laws pardon, It lies.

952
01:43:35,139 --> 01:43:37,750
Suppose they patch the law,
take away your liberty.

953
01:43:37,976 --> 01:43:39,401
Making you a slave.

954
01:43:39,550 --> 01:43:42,450
Suppose.
- That ain't a supposable case.

955
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:46,200
Laws change, Epps.
Universal truths are constant.

956
01:43:46,300 --> 01:43:47,750
It is a fact,

957
01:43:47,850 --> 01:43:50,700
a plain and simle fact that what is true and right..

958
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:55,800
Is true and right for all.
White and black alike.

959
01:43:56,550 --> 01:43:58,600
Yah compare me to a nigger, Bass?

960
01:43:58,700 --> 01:44:02,700
I only ask, in the eye's of God..
What's the difference?

961
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:08,000
Yah might as well ask what the difference
is between a white man and a baboon.

962
01:44:08,900 --> 01:44:11,600
Now, I seen one of them critters in Orleans..

963
01:44:11,700 --> 01:44:14,350
That knowed just as much as any nigger I got.

964
01:44:14,450 --> 01:44:17,900
Listen, Eps ...
These niggers are human beings.

965
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,400
If they are allowed to scale no higher than brute animals,

966
01:44:20,500 --> 01:44:24,000
you and men like you will have to answer for it.

967
01:44:24,100 --> 01:44:26,300
There's an ill, Mr. Epps.

968
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:29,550
A fearful ill, resting on this nation--

969
01:44:29,650 --> 01:44:33,150
There will be a day of reckoning yet.

970
01:44:35,150 --> 01:44:38,000
You like to hear yourself talk, Bass,

971
01:44:38,100 --> 01:44:41,050
better than any man I know of.

972
01:44:41,150 --> 01:44:44,950
Yah'd argue that black was white, or white black

973
01:44:45,050 --> 01:44:48,250
if anybody would contradict you.

974
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:52,650
A fine supposition if yah lived
among Yankees in New England.

975
01:44:52,750 --> 01:44:55,550
But yah don't.

976
01:44:57,900 --> 01:45:01,100
You most assuredly do not.

977
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:28,600
I know it's somewhere in there!

978
01:45:30,450 --> 01:45:33,450
Patsey!

979
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:35,850
Pats!

980
01:45:35,950 --> 01:45:37,950
Where is she?

981
01:45:38,050 --> 01:45:39,500
Where the Pats?

982
01:45:45,100 --> 01:45:48,250
Where is she? Where the Pats'?
Whatcha just standing there?

983
01:45:48,350 --> 01:45:50,250
We know nothin' of her, Massa.
- The hell you don't!

984
01:45:50,300 --> 01:45:52,100
We do not know anything about ...
- About what?

985
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:53,650
Where did she go?
- I do not know.

986
01:45:53,700 --> 01:45:55,000
She run off, ain't she?
- I do not know anything.

987
01:45:55,050 --> 01:45:56,700
She ran off!
Where is it?

988
01:45:59,100 --> 01:46:01,650
You know it! You know it! You know it!
- No, no, no ...

989
01:46:01,750 --> 01:46:04,750
No i don't.

990
01:46:05,650 --> 01:46:11,150
You miserable black dogs stand like
the deef and dumb.

991
01:46:12,250 --> 01:46:14,750
Speak!

992
01:46:28,750 --> 01:46:30,950
She gone...

993
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:35,600
My Pats gone.

994
01:46:51,650 --> 01:46:53,700
Run off. Run off, did you?

995
01:46:53,750 --> 01:46:55,700
Massa Epps--
- You miserable wench! Where you been?

996
01:46:55,750 --> 01:46:58,350
I been nowhere.
- Lies to your misdeeds!

997
01:46:58,450 --> 01:47:01,300
The Sabbath day, Massa.
I took me a walk to commune wit da Lord.

998
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:04,800
Bring the Lord into yer deceptions?
Comin' from Shaw's plantation weren't yah?

999
01:47:04,850 --> 01:47:07,100
...No...
- Now yah speak?

1000
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:09,350
Now that yah want to add to
'er lies yah find yer tongue!

1001
01:47:09,400 --> 01:47:12,200
I went to Massa Shaw's plantation!

1002
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:13,950
You admit it?
- Yes.

1003
01:47:14,050 --> 01:47:16,950
Freely. And you know why.

1004
01:47:17,050 --> 01:47:20,200
I got this from Mistress Shaw.

1005
01:47:20,300 --> 01:47:24,700
Mistress Epps won't even grant me
no soap ta clean with.

1006
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:29,300
Stink so much I make myself gag.

1007
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:37,000
Five hundred pounds 'a cotton
day in, day out!

1008
01:47:37,150 --> 01:47:39,100
More than any man here.

1009
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:41,300
And 'fo that I will be clean;

1010
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:43,050
that all I ask.

1011
01:47:43,150 --> 01:47:47,600
Dis here what I went to Shaw's 'fo.

1012
01:47:47,700 --> 01:47:52,800
Liar! Liar!
- Lord knows it all!

1013
01:47:52,900 --> 01:47:58,050
You lie!
- And you blind wit yer own covetousness.

1014
01:47:58,150 --> 01:48:00,650
I don't lie, Massa.

1015
01:48:00,750 --> 01:48:04,500
If you kill me, I'll stick ta that.

1016
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:07,000
Yeah, I'll set you down.

1017
01:48:07,100 --> 01:48:09,400
I'll learn you to go to Shaw's.

1018
01:48:09,500 --> 01:48:11,700
Treach!

1019
01:48:12,750 --> 01:48:14,300
Go fetch some line.

1020
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:16,600
Edward?

1021
01:48:17,150 --> 01:48:21,150
Strip her.
Strike her bare 'n lash her to the post.

1022
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:25,600
No!

1023
01:48:38,650 --> 01:48:41,650
Yah done this to yerself, Pats!

1024
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:54,600
Do it!

1025
01:48:58,700 --> 01:49:01,700
Strike the life from her.

1026
01:49:07,100 --> 01:49:09,300
Beat her.

1027
01:49:10,050 --> 01:49:12,850
Give her the whip.
Give it all to her!

1028
01:49:13,650 --> 01:49:17,150
Plat, come here
and play it immediately!

1029
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,200
Platt!

1030
01:49:22,900 --> 01:49:25,400
Come here!

1031
01:49:25,950 --> 01:49:28,950
PATSEY: I'd rather it you, Platt.

1032
01:49:29,050 --> 01:49:31,250
Strike her.

1033
01:49:31,700 --> 01:49:34,700
Strike her.

1034
01:49:55,400 --> 01:49:57,900
He pantomimes.

1035
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,500
There ain't barely a welt on her.

1036
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:03,050
That's what your niggers make of yah;

1037
01:50:03,150 --> 01:50:05,950
a fool fer the takin'.

1038
01:50:09,750 --> 01:50:12,250
Strike her, Platt!
Strike her.

1039
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:32,700
Yah will strike her.
Yah will strike her until her flesh is rent..

1040
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:36,900
And meat and blood flow equal,
or I will kill every nigger in my sight!

1041
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,750
Do you understand me?
Strike her!

1042
01:50:39,850 --> 01:50:42,850
Strike her!

1043
01:51:24,750 --> 01:51:28,550
Until I say no more!
I ain't said nothing!

1044
01:51:33,600 --> 01:51:35,750
Give me the whip!

1045
01:51:35,850 --> 01:51:37,450
Give it!

1046
01:51:37,550 --> 01:51:39,650
Give me the whip!

1047
01:51:39,750 --> 01:51:41,750
Get up!

1048
01:52:00,350 --> 01:52:03,150
You're the devil!

1049
01:52:04,700 --> 01:52:06,700
Sooner or later...

1050
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:14,300
somewhere in the course of eternal justice
thou shalt answer for this sin!

1051
01:52:17,450 --> 01:52:21,450
Sin? There is no sin.

1052
01:52:22,100 --> 01:52:25,900
A man does how he pleases with his property.

1053
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:34,350
At the moment, Platt, I am of great pleasure.

1054
01:52:34,450 --> 01:52:39,450
You be goddamn careful
I don't come to wantin' to lightenin' my mood no further.

1055
01:54:56,350 --> 01:54:58,500
Master Bass,

1056
01:54:58,600 --> 01:55:02,400
I want to ask you
what part of the country you came from?

1057
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:05,200
No part of this land.

1058
01:55:05,700 --> 01:55:08,600
I was born in Canada.

1059
01:55:08,700 --> 01:55:10,550
Now guess where that is.

1060
01:55:10,650 --> 01:55:13,400
Oh, I know where Canada is.

1061
01:55:13,500 --> 01:55:16,700
I have been there myself.

1062
01:55:20,100 --> 01:55:22,050
Montreal and

1063
01:55:22,150 --> 01:55:24,900
Kingston and Queenston
and a great many places.

1064
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,200
Well traveled for a slave.

1065
01:55:27,300 --> 01:55:29,800
How came you here?

1066
01:55:30,450 --> 01:55:33,450
Master Bass,

1067
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:38,300
if justice had been done
I never would have been here.

1068
01:55:42,700 --> 01:55:44,950
How's this?

1069
01:55:45,050 --> 01:55:47,550
Tell me all.

1070
01:55:51,500 --> 01:55:54,300
I am afraid to tell you.

1071
01:55:55,200 --> 01:55:58,700
Every word you speak is a profound secret.

1072
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,300
Your story ...

1073
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:12,600
...it is amazing, and in no good way.

1074
01:56:16,700 --> 01:56:18,450
Do you believe, sir ...

1075
01:56:18,550 --> 01:56:21,400
..in justice as you have said?

1076
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:22,838
Yes, I do.

1077
01:56:23,038 --> 01:56:26,790
- That slavery is an evil that should befall none?

1078
01:56:29,750 --> 01:56:34,750
I believe so.
- If you truly do,

1079
01:56:35,350 --> 01:56:37,500
Then, I would ask...

1080
01:56:37,600 --> 01:56:40,100
I would beg...

1081
01:56:41,250 --> 01:56:44,350
that you write my friends in the north,

1082
01:56:44,450 --> 01:56:48,450
acquainting them with my situation..

1083
01:56:48,550 --> 01:56:51,200
And beseeching them to forward;

1084
01:56:51,300 --> 01:56:55,100
free papers.

1085
01:56:57,700 --> 01:57:01,500
It would be...

1086
01:57:02,550 --> 01:57:06,650
an unspeakable happiness;

1087
01:57:06,850 --> 01:57:10,050
To see my wife

1088
01:57:11,450 --> 01:57:15,450
and my family again.

1089
01:57:19,650 --> 01:57:23,800
I've been traveling this country for
the best part of twenty years.

1090
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,800
My freedom is everything.

1091
01:57:26,900 --> 01:57:32,400
The fact that I can walk out of here tomorrow
gives me most pleasure.

1092
01:57:33,600 --> 01:57:36,800
My life doesn't mean much to anyone,

1093
01:57:37,350 --> 01:57:41,750
but it seems your life means a lot to a lot of people.

1094
01:57:42,750 --> 01:57:44,650
About what you're asking me..

1095
01:57:44,750 --> 01:57:48,250
Sir, scares me.

1096
01:57:49,450 --> 01:57:53,250
I must say, I am afraid.

1097
01:57:53,350 --> 01:57:57,150
Not just for you, but for me.

1098
01:58:04,850 --> 01:58:07,500
I will write your letter sir,

1099
01:58:07,600 --> 01:58:09,950
for if I could bring freedom,
it will be more than a pleasure.

1100
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,150
...it will be my duty.

1101
01:58:12,250 --> 01:58:17,250
Now, would you be so kindly
hand me those sickles?

1102
02:00:50,150 --> 02:00:54,950
Platt...? Where is the boy called Platt?

1103
02:00:57,150 --> 02:00:59,950
Come here, boy.

1104
02:01:20,600 --> 02:01:23,800
Your name is Platt, is it?

1105
02:01:24,150 --> 02:01:26,050
Yes, sir.

1106
02:01:26,150 --> 02:01:29,350
Do you know that man?

1107
02:01:45,400 --> 02:01:47,600
Mr. Parker...?

1108
02:01:47,700 --> 02:01:49,900
Say again?

1109
02:01:51,250 --> 02:01:53,500
Mr. Parker?

1110
02:01:53,600 --> 02:01:56,250
That man received a letter
compiling many accusations.

1111
02:01:56,350 --> 02:01:58,700
You look me in the eye...

1112
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:00,450
and on your life answer me truthfully:

1113
02:02:00,500 --> 02:02:02,300
have you any other name than Platt?

1114
02:02:02,350 --> 02:02:05,800
Solomon Northup is my name.
- Sheriff... What's all this?

1115
02:02:05,900 --> 02:02:08,650
It's official business.
- My nigga 's my job.

1116
02:02:08,750 --> 02:02:10,600
Your business waits.

1117
02:02:10,700 --> 02:02:12,850
Tell me of your family.
- I have a wife and two children.

1118
02:02:12,900 --> 02:02:15,100
...two. - What the hell?
- What were your children's names?

1119
02:02:15,150 --> 02:02:17,450
Margaret and Alonzo.
- And your wife's name before her marriage?

1120
02:02:17,500 --> 02:02:19,550
Anne Hampton.
I am who I say.

1121
02:02:19,650 --> 02:02:21,200
Where are you going, Platt?

1122
02:02:21,250 --> 02:02:23,250
Who authorized you to roam
on my property? - My mistake.

1123
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,800
Platt, come back here!
Platt!

1124
02:02:26,900 --> 02:02:29,400
Come back here, boy!

1125
02:02:32,550 --> 02:02:34,850
Nah... You will unhand 'em.
Platt is my nigger!

1126
02:02:34,900 --> 02:02:37,600
He is Mr. Solomon Nortap!
- You say...

1127
02:02:37,700 --> 02:02:40,250
You come here, humiliate me
and make claims.

1128
02:02:40,300 --> 02:02:41,950
I have no doubts.
This is Solomon Northup,

1129
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,350
To hell with that! My nigger,
and I'll fight you for 'em!

1130
02:02:44,450 --> 02:02:45,750
As is your right.

1131
02:02:45,800 --> 02:02:48,200
As it will be my pleasure
to bankrupt you in the courts.

1132
02:02:48,250 --> 02:02:51,050
Your decision.
Unhand him!

1133
02:02:51,550 --> 02:02:53,500
You think this is the last you'll see of me, boy?

1134
02:02:53,550 --> 02:02:55,700
It ain't.

1135
02:02:55,750 --> 02:02:58,850
I paid fairly for this nigga!
The court has the documents to prove it!

1136
02:02:58,950 --> 02:03:00,800
And we have the documents also
proving that it is free!

1137
02:03:00,850 --> 02:03:02,750
I own you!
You belong to me! Can you hear me?

1138
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:06,400
Keep your hands off him!
- The court will take you back before sundown!

1139
02:03:06,500 --> 02:03:10,500
Platt!
- Get my horse, please.

1140
02:03:18,950 --> 02:03:21,700
Get away from him, Pats'!

1141
02:03:21,750 --> 02:03:25,950
I'll be seeing you real soon.

1142
02:03:28,550 --> 02:03:31,000
Solomon?

1143
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:09,800
I apologize...

1144
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:14,000
for my appearance.

1145
02:05:15,550 --> 02:05:18,350
But I have had..

1146
02:05:18,450 --> 02:05:21,200
A difficult time....

1147
02:05:21,400 --> 02:05:24,900
...these past many years

1148
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:32,200
Margaret?

1149
02:05:35,950 --> 02:05:39,350
Alonzo?

1150
02:06:08,850 --> 02:06:11,400
Who is this?

1151
02:06:11,500 --> 02:06:14,500
This is my husband.

1152
02:06:15,100 --> 02:06:16,950
Husband ...

1153
02:06:17,050 --> 02:06:21,450
It is very good to meet you, sir.

1154
02:06:22,100 --> 02:06:24,300
We have much acquainting to do.

1155
02:06:24,400 --> 02:06:27,050
Yes, sir.

1156
02:06:27,150 --> 02:06:29,000
And this ...

1157
02:06:29,100 --> 02:06:31,850
...is your grandson.

1158
02:06:31,950 --> 02:06:36,350
Solomon Northup Staunton.

1159
02:06:45,350 --> 02:06:48,150
Solomon.

1160
02:06:56,900 --> 02:06:59,900
Forgive me.

1161
02:07:02,200 --> 02:07:07,000
There is nothing to forgive.

1162
02:07:27,800 --> 02:07:34,000
Solomon Northup was one of the few victims
of kidnapping to regain freedom from salvery.

1163
02:07:35,200 --> 02:08:38,800
Solomon brought the men responisble
for his abducation to trail

1164
02:07:40,200 --> 02:07:44,800
Unable to testify against whites in
the nation's capital,


1165
02:07:49,200 --> 02:07:53,800
he lost the case against the slave
pen owner, James Burch

1166
02:07:54,200 --> 02:07:58,200
After lengthy legal proceedings in New York, his kidnappers
Hamilton and Brown also avoided prosecution.

1167
02:08:00,200 --> 02:08:04,200
In 1853 Solomon published the book "Twelve Years a Slave"

1168
02:08:06,200 --> 02:08:10,800
He became active in te abolitionist movement,
lectured on slavery

1169
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:17,400
troughout the Northeastern United States and
aided fuitive slaves on the Underground Railroad.

1170
02:08:18,400 --> 02:08:23,800
The date, location and circumstanses of
Solomon's death are unknown

1171
02:08:24,201 --> 02:08:27,801
THE END
