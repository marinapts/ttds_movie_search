00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:10,509
Studio Ghibli, Nippon Television Network,
Dentsu, Hakuhodo DYMP, Walt Disney Japan,
Mitsubishi, Toho and KDDI present

2
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:22,730
THE WIND RISES

3
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:30,738
The wind is rising!
We must try to live.

4
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,632
Here it is.

5
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,848
May I borrow it?

6
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,684
- It's in English.
- I have a dictionary.

7
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,353
- Very good. Give it a go.
- Thank you.

8
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,041
- Knock it off.
- Butt out!

9
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,709
Better get going.

10
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,544
Jiro...

11
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,172
No more bullying, okay?

12
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,358
You look quite the hero.

13
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,736
I slipped and fell.

14
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:06,239
- Fighting is never justified.
- I know.

15
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,493
Go have your snack.

16
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,244
Thank you.

17
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,415
Big brother, you're back!

18
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:20,879
I was waiting for you.
Let's pick bamboo grass.

19
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:23,882
Big brother!

20
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:29,429
I want to pick bamboo grass.

21
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,603
You promised to go with me.

22
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:37,979
I've got homework.

23
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,196
That's not homework.

24
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,739
It's an English magazine.

25
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,744
What a stupid moustache.

26
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,789
He's a famous Italian aircraft designer.

27
00:06:56,082 --> 00:07:00,627
His name is Caproni.
It says he's a count.

28
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,922
- Your face is scratched.
- Leave it alone.

29
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,758
I better put some iodine on it.

30
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,802
Would you be quiet?

31
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,982
Big brother, what are you doing?

32
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,817
You're not allowed up here.

33
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,485
You're not wearing glasses.

34
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:29,990
Focusing on the stars
should improve my eyesight.

35
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,661
- Mother will scold you.
- A shooting star!

36
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,747
There's another one.

37
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,335
They're pretty.
See? Like that.

38
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,839
There's so many of them.

39
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,045
I'm a Japanese boy.

40
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:33,345
I think this is my dream.

41
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,405
This is my dream, you know.

42
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,324
It's mine too.

43
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:55,909
Your dream?

44
00:08:56,077 --> 00:09:00,580
Listen, Japanese boy.
You think we are sharing this dream?

45
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:01,915
It's strange.

46
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:06,419
You're Count Caproni, aren't you?
I'm very glad to meet you.

47
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:12,092
Interesting. Yes, this is a dream.
This world is a dream.

48
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,094
Welcome to my kingdom.

49
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,762
I'm honored.

50
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,765
Look at them.

51
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:28,024
They will bomb the enemy city.
Most of them won't return.

52
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,284
But the war will soon be over.

53
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,128
Climb up, Japanese boy.

54
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:54,843
This is my dream.
When the war is over, I will build this.

55
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,763
Magnificent, isn't she?

56
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:00,807
Let's fly.

57
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,564
Instead of bombs,
she'll carry passengers.

58
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,492
Of course we can't climb up here...

59
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,662
but dreams are convenient.
One can go anywhere.

60
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:33,882
Come, join me.
You can walk along the spar.

61
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,180
Take a look.

62
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:19,219
- She's beautiful, no?
- Yes, incredible.

63
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:27,477
She'll carry a hundred people
across the Atlantic.

64
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,731
Mr. Caproni?
I have a question.

65
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:36,236
Do you think I could
design airplanes?

66
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,741
I'll never be a pilot.
I'm too nearsighted.

67
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,412
Listen, Japanese boy.

68
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:48,915
I'm not a pilot.
I don't even know how to fly.

69
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,919
To fly airplanes is simple.

70
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:57,674
But I am a creator of airplanes.
An aeronautical engineer!

71
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,217
Yes!

72
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,594
Listen to me, Japanese boy.

73
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:06,099
Airplanes are not tools for war.
They are not for making money.

74
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,768
Airplanes are beautiful dreams.

75
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:12,063
Engineers turn dreams into reality.

76
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:13,565
Yes!

77
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,693
Arrivederci. We'll meet again.

78
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:33,960
Jiro, you should go to bed.

79
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:39,799
You startled me.
I heard you talking to someone.

80
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:43,303
Mother, I'm going to be
an aeronautical engineer.

81
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:46,306
Really? That's a wonderful dream.

82
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:50,059
Airplanes are beautiful dreams.
That's what he told me.

83
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,604
I want to design beautiful airplanes.

84
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,968
You, there.
Come, take my seat.

85
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,178
Pardon me.

86
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,429
Please.

87
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,717
The wind feels wonderful.

88
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,637
Miss, you'll lose your hat.

89
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:08,888
Don't worry, Kinu.

90
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:18,898
Watch out!

91
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,236
Are you all right?

92
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,029
Safe!

93
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,864
Nice play.

94
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:28,950
Thank you.

95
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,244
"Le vent se lve."

96
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,081
"Il faut tenter de vivre."

97
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:03,234
"Le vent se lve.
Il faut tenter de vivre."

98
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:07,614
"The wind is rising.
We must try to live."

99
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,126
Earthquake.

100
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,389
The boiler's going to blow!

101
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,359
- What's wrong?
- Her leg.

102
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,694
Show me.

103
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,030
It hurts.

104
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,490
Kinu, be brave.

105
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:17,285
It's broken.
She can't walk like this.

106
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,538
Miss, the boiler.
Please save yourself.

107
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,206
That's nonsense.

108
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,877
Nothing's going to explode.

109
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,380
My suitcase.

110
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,097
Now, try to relax.

111
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,897
She can't walk.
Where do you live?

112
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,566
- In Ueno.
- I'll get you there.

113
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,247
- Fire.
- Let's go.

114
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,349
- What about your luggage?
- It's not important.

115
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,290
I'm so sorry.

116
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,792
Hang on!

117
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,345
We'd better hurry.

118
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,517
One of my shirts.
It's brand new.

119
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,185
You must be thirsty.

120
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,151
The well's almost dry.
What about you?

121
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,402
Thank you.

122
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,535
The fire hasn't reached Ueno.

123
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:07,246
I'm heading for the university.
What about you?

124
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,415
I'll bring someone from home.

125
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,751
I'll go with you.

126
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,712
- Look after this, Kinu.
- I will.

127
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,131
We'll be back soon.
Don't worry.

128
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,508
Watch my suitcase.

129
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,676
- Thank you.
- I'll leave her to you.

130
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,678
But what's your name?

131
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:53,019
That was some guy.
Don't you think, Kinu?

132
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,664
Jiro! You picked a great day
to come back.

133
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,374
How bad is it, Honjo?

134
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,044
The whole east side is burning.

135
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,465
That's everything we could carry.

136
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,008
Got a smoke?

137
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:33,517
A flying door? That's just great.
They'll never stop the fire now.

138
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,352
Tokyo's finished.

139
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:53,871
He really built it.
Caproni has giant dreams.

140
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,475
Stop the camera!

141
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:07,278
The wind's shifting.
It's coming this way.

142
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:14,243
Is the wind still rising,
Japanese boy?

143
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,288
Yes, it's a gale.

144
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:21,417
Then you must live.
"Le vent se lve."

145
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,961
"II faut tenter de vivre."

146
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,356
Hey Jiro. Ready?

147
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:31,111
All the new buildings
are old-fashioned.

148
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,364
The streets are wider.

149
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,741
Even the airplanes haven't changed.

150
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,370
Welcome!

151
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,918
Mackerel again?

152
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,544
It's great.

153
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:50,547
Every day's the same.
Same lunch, same lectures.

154
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,716
Can I get an egg?

155
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:56,053
The Western powers
are building all-metal aircraft.

156
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,681
Try the pork sometime.

157
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:01,684
We're more than ten years behind.

158
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,061
What?

159
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,604
Beautiful, isn't it?

160
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,565
Look at that wonderful curve.

161
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:11,610
You eat mackerel
to look at the bones?

162
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:15,239
Come on, finish up.
We're going for coffee.

163
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,420
Jiro sure is working hard.

164
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,255
Fish bones.

165
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,966
Is Mr. Horikoshi back from lunch?

166
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,134
Jiro!

167
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:37,553
Honjo, listen to this.

168
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:41,932
The NACA has a standard
curve just like this bone.

169
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,767
Do Americans eat mackerel too?

170
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:46,061
Jiro, package for you.

171
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:50,899
A lady brought this for you, sir.

172
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,319
You were out,
so she left it with me.

173
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:55,946
I see. Thank you.

174
00:26:57,574 --> 00:27:00,117
Present from your sweetheart?

175
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:03,120
Got a smoke? Gimme one.

176
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,555
- Jiro!
- Let him go.

177
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:48,374
- Hello, Mr. Horikoshi.
- Back from school.

178
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:52,669
Your guest is waiting.
A young lady.

179
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,505
Oh, right.

180
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:05,557
Honestly, where were you?

181
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:08,060
Kayo, I'm sorry.

182
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,312
I completely forgot.

183
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,688
Really!

184
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,400
- Where's Mother?
- At Uncle's.

185
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:17,069
- Is she staying there?
- Just for one night.

186
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:21,824
You've grown, Kayo.
And gotten very pretty, too.

187
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:26,328
You're so mean.
You never ever come home.

188
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,668
Oh, it's almost sunset already.

189
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:37,214
I'll tell them I kept you.
Let's take the penny steamer.

190
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,927
She must really like you.

191
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,721
Come on, it's been two years.

192
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,558
Didn't you try to see her again?

193
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,269
Of course.
I went back once.

194
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:05,075
The fire stopped at her street.

195
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:06,660
See? There's the dock.

196
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,091
Are you cold?

197
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:25,304
I'm fine. I never dreamed
Tokyo would recover so quickly.

198
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:32,269
Can I stay with you, Jiro?

199
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:35,647
Father won't let me
live here by myself.

200
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:39,651
I'll probably be in Nagoya
by the time you come.

201
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,820
- With an airplane company?
- Yes.

202
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,822
Men have it so good.

203
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:47,576
I want to study medicine in Tokyo.

204
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:51,079
A doctor? I think
you might be a good one.

205
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:53,081
I think so too.

206
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:55,959
I'll talk to Father
next time I'm home.

207
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,462
Thanks. I'm counting on you.

208
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:05,862
Jiro!

209
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:09,533
There you are.

210
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,076
- You made it.
- Finally.

211
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,745
- We're on our way.
- Yes, we are.

212
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:35,392
They must've been
heading for the city.

213
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:37,060
There were hundreds of them.

214
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:39,187
There's no work in the countryside.

215
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:46,945
Another bank failure.
Which one is it this time?

216
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,578
- Are those the customers?
- Looks like it.

217
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:57,080
There were rumors.

218
00:31:57,832 --> 00:32:02,085
The economy's in the tank.
So is our new employer.

219
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:18,894
MITSUBISHI INTERNAL
COMBUSTION ENGINE CO.

220
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,566
We've been waiting for you.
What took you so long?

221
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,402
I was told to come
anytime in April.

222
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,280
Then you should've come in March!

223
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,241
I've got an assignment for you.

224
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,287
It's the design for the wing strut fitting.

225
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:40,791
I need it right away.
We're behind schedule already.

226
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:46,963
In here.

227
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:51,635
The data's ready.
This way.

228
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,311
This is your desk.

229
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:04,815
It's imported,
but no one likes it.

230
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,192
Data here, hat goes there.

231
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:10,779
Listen up! The Falcon Project
has a new engineer.

232
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:14,783
He's the genius we've all
been hearing about.

233
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,118
Introduce yourself.

234
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,161
Jiro Horikoshi.

235
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,330
Now get to work.

236
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,387
Jiro, come on.

237
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,265
It's lunchtime. Let's go.

238
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:08,021
- The assembly plant?
- Yes, I'd like to take a look.

239
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:13,777
Asking a green engineer to design
that fitting is practically hazing.

240
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,153
Two.

241
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:18,949
Excuse me.
Could we ask a favor?

242
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,618
Look, it's really coming along.

243
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:24,830
Sorry to bother you on your break.

244
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:28,959
Not at all. You young engineers
should visit us more often.

245
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:32,587
Honjo, the strut's already installed.

246
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,089
I knew it.

247
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:38,134
Kurokawa's just hazing you.
Is his fitting better than yours?

248
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,846
Mr. Kurokawa's always hard
on new employees.

249
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:44,182
Honjo, get up here
and take a look.

250
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,309
I need your opinion.

251
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,609
- What do you think?
- Looks strong enough.

252
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:57,988
This is no good.
It's just like my design.

253
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,865
Then it must be bad.

254
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,200
Foreman, lunch break's over.

255
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,827
Quiet.

256
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:07,163
Fascinating! Aircraft are fascinating!

257
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:09,374
Maybe they are, but we're late.

258
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:19,885
I'm Hattori.

259
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,057
Mr. Hattori is our chief engineer.

260
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,893
Is this his first assignment?

261
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,395
The strut fitting for the Falcon.

262
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:33,565
That's no fitting.
Explain yourself, young man.

263
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:37,819
Yes sir. This leaf spring
will absorb stress from the wing.

264
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,906
The wire expands
and contracts automatically.

265
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:45,243
It runs through the strut
to an anchor on the fuselage.

266
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:49,080
But we'd have to
redesign the wing!

267
00:36:49,206 --> 00:36:52,083
You're right.
I haven't done the calculations yet.

268
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:56,254
You're wasting your time.
Where's the assignment I gave you?

269
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,589
It's finished.

270
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:06,097
That looks like
a very clean design to me.

271
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:08,683
It's perfect.

272
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:12,062
Submit your work
as soon as you finish!

273
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:18,109
- I'm heading out.
- Me too.

274
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:20,946
What about Kurokawa's homework?

275
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,280
Just finishing up.

276
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,453
Oxen!

277
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,872
They haul prototypes
to the airfield.

278
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:35,460
The latest aircraft, hauled by oxen.
That's how backward we are.

279
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,295
But they're wonderful creatures.

280
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:43,903
Here she comes.

281
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,031
Get ready!

282
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,702
Approaching the mark.

283
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,211
Damn it!

284
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:13,558
- Did you get it?
- 13.3 seconds. 145 knots.

285
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:16,227
Too slow.
We need ten more knots.

286
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:19,564
She's too low.
The engine's not performing.

287
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,567
Kurokawa!

288
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,403
Representatives from the Army.

289
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,113
An audacious design.

290
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:31,076
- Another coup for Mitsubishi.
- Your Falcon is quite impressive.

291
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:51,930
Power dive.
She's trying to break 200.

292
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,956
- Parachute's open.
- Go get him!

293
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:38,143
Mr. Kurokawa, we'll investigate
the cause when the weather clears.

294
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,311
- What about the pilot?
- He's okay.

295
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:41,646
That's good.

296
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:46,234
Mr. Kurokawa, let's go.
We'll build Falcon Two.

297
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:50,363
Do you think the strut fitting failed?

298
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:55,660
No. I think the problem
is deeper and more complicated.

299
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,663
I'll never forget what I saw today.

300
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:02,167
It's like an endless road is
opening up before my eyes.

301
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,670
There won't be a Falcon Two.

302
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:09,382
The Army has decided
to go with a competing design.

303
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:14,387
Today was our last chance
to change their minds.

304
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:19,017
We're going to build a bomber
with help from Junkers.

305
00:41:19,476 --> 00:41:21,352
No more fighters for now.

306
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:27,358
This is your chance to see Germany.
I've already approved it.

307
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,438
- Still open?
- Ah, welcome back.

308
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:07,899
You're later than usual.

309
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,902
- Two slices of the usual.
- Coming up.

310
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,744
There you are.

311
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,913
Isn't anyone looking after them?

312
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:26,918
Their parents work late.
They wait there every night.

313
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,754
I feel bad closing the place up.

314
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,589
I see. Well, thanks.

315
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,091
Come again.

316
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:43,601
You must be hungry.
Here's something to eat.

317
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,604
It's sponge cake.
I just bought it.

318
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:00,618
Go ahead, take it.

319
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,453
Come on!

320
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:19,971
You here, Jiro?

321
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:25,977
Too bad about the Falcon.
I heard they axed it.

322
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:30,982
Sponge cake? You have
some strange eating habits.

323
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:43,328
What did you expect?

324
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:47,749
Did you think she was going to
smile and say thank you?

325
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,334
Of course not.

326
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:53,004
Well, maybe I did.

327
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:58,676
There are dozens of hungry kids
right here in this neighborhood.

328
00:43:59,636 --> 00:44:04,891
The cost of one fitting would feed
that kid's family for a month.

329
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:08,019
Why is Japan so poor?

330
00:44:08,645 --> 00:44:13,691
Jiro, do you know what we're paying
the Germans for their technology?

331
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:18,738
Enough to feed every kid in Japan,
with sponge cake for dessert.

332
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:22,867
Still, I plan to make the most
of this opportunity.

333
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:24,702
They're sending you too?

334
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,037
They told me today.

335
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,039
Really? That's great news.

336
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,167
Poor countries want airplanes.

337
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:34,712
So they pay us a lot
to design them. It's ironic.

338
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:39,217
I'm leaving for Tokyo tomorrow.
Getting married.

339
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,676
Married?

340
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:45,223
To work hard at the office,
you need a family at home.

341
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:47,058
More irony.

342
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:27,598
Tight-fisted Germans.
They're hardly showing us anything.

343
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,600
I don't see any oxen.

344
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:31,936
The airstrip's
next to the plant.

345
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:33,938
Everything's so big.

346
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:59,380
It's the G-38.
Is this what we're buying?

347
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:02,800
For conversion to a bomber.
It's top secret.

348
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:06,137
Who's the Army planning
to bomb with this thing?

349
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:08,806
America, probably.
Not that they could.

350
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:13,478
Still, it's quite something.

351
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:14,854
Amazing.

352
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:19,358
Passengers can sit in the wings.
This would be wasted as a bomber.

353
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:24,489
Who cares? We need
their all-metal airframe technology.

354
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:31,162
You're kidding.
We can't go inside?

355
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:01,192
Beautiful.

356
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:10,243
Stop it.
Take your hands off him.

357
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:12,870
Is this how Germans
treat their guests?

358
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:17,208
You Japanese copy everything.
This technology belongs to Germany.

359
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:21,045
Oh, come on. Japan has
lots of planes like this.

360
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:22,672
Honjo, let it go.

361
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:27,051
We have a license
to your technology.

362
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:32,431
We signed an agreement.
We have the right to be here.

363
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:37,395
Your bosses never said
we couldn't inspect this airplane.

364
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:41,232
I'm sure you're only
trying to do your job...

365
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:46,571
but we won't tolerate this treatment.
The agreement is between equals.

366
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:50,908
Our orders were not to let
you Japanese wander around.

367
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,928
That's Dr. Junkers.

368
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:12,930
What an engineer.

369
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:18,269
You can go inside.
Dr. Junkers has agreed.

370
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,451
I'm surprised we got a demonstration.

371
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,620
There's more vibration
than I expected.

372
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:38,873
Our bosses are getting giddy.

373
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:42,293
Let the Army officers sit here.

374
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,299
Just a moment.

375
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:51,302
This is truly a stupendous aircraft.

376
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:55,640
Look, a corridor through the wing.

377
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,143
This is amazing.

378
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:03,147
It's like being inside a power plant.

379
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:11,322
Guten tag.
Dr. Junkers gave us permission.

380
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,616
Please show us your work station.

381
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,618
This is the flight engineer's station.

382
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:17,662
This aircraft is marvelous.

383
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:22,500
Japanese, do not go further.

384
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,337
Of course, my friend.

385
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,507
- This is incredible.
- Yes, it's fantastic.

386
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:32,843
A triumph of
German industrial technology.

387
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:08,379
Dr. Junkers is my hero,
but his company is sneaky.

388
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,216
Got a cigarette, Jiro?

389
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:14,719
Jiro!

390
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,055
A cigarette.

391
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,391
No. We're out.

392
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:40,411
It looks cold outside,
but this room is cozy.

393
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:44,081
I thought Germans used fireplaces.

394
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:49,253
Junkers makes radiators too.
This almost looks like that plane.

395
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:50,421
It's beautiful.

396
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:54,759
And our technology is primitive.
That's what you mean, right?

397
00:50:55,427 --> 00:51:00,264
You think we'll never figure out
all-metal construction on our own?

398
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:04,602
We can't learn anything from this.

399
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,938
These are just pretty equations.

400
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:11,609
"This technology belongs to Germany."

401
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:15,613
Maybe we don't even
need their technology.

402
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:18,449
Wood and canvas
could be as good as metal.

403
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:22,953
Then we'll never make it.
We're already 20 years behind.

404
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:29,293
Let's take a walk.

405
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:32,463
My brain is boiling.

406
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:44,934
We're Achilles, chasing a tortoise
with a twenty-year lead.

407
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:50,272
If we close the gap
in five years...

408
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:52,942
he'll be five more years
down the road.

409
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:56,278
We'll always be chasing him.

410
00:51:56,404 --> 00:52:01,242
Someday we'll overtake him
and move ahead.

411
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:05,120
I wonder if we
can be the tortoise.

412
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:12,962
What?

413
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,217
Listen to that.

414
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:27,142
Schubert's "Winter Journey".
It's perfect for us.

415
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:53,836
- What was that about?
- We saw him in the hangar.

416
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:54,396
Jiro?

417
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:58,400
I'm done. Go have a bath.

418
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:04,573
Dead to the world...

419
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:09,078
with a face like he's carrying
the future of Japanese aviation.

420
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:14,583
There's a telegram from headquarters.

421
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:16,460
- Come in.
- Not necessary.

422
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:20,756
Some of us are returning immediately.
You're staying behind.

423
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:24,259
Jiro will continue west
and return to Japan.

424
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:27,262
- West?
- They want him to see the world.

425
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:28,931
All by himself?

426
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:56,792
Mr. Caproni.

427
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:59,086
Is the wind still rising?

428
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:01,672
Yes, it is.

429
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:06,468
Then I invite you to join me
on my final flight. Come.

430
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:08,470
You're retiring?

431
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:11,807
It's a big jump.

432
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:17,312
Jump!

433
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:29,408
Hurry. We're taking off.

434
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:33,412
There's a hatch under the fuselage.

435
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:35,330
Hurry!

436
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:36,707
Let me through.

437
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,000
Up here!

438
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:49,011
- Full power!
- Fly! Fly!

439
00:55:56,311 --> 00:56:01,065
My workmen's families and relatives.
Practically the whole village.

440
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:03,692
We're taking a private jaunt...

441
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:07,529
before we deliver this bomber
to the Air Force.

442
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:16,038
- What do you think?
- It's incredible.

443
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:19,541
It's like a building
out of ancient Rome.

444
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:23,212
This plane is too large
to be used for war...

445
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:25,756
but the Air Force
likes everything big.

446
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:28,717
Japan is poor and backward.

447
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:32,721
We could never build
something like this.

448
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:35,849
The important thing
for an engineer is inspiration.

449
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:40,604
Inspiration unlocks the future.
Technology will catch up.

450
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,067
My wife and family.

451
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:50,072
We Italians are also poor.
Too many mouths to feed.

452
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:59,414
Hey, settle down.
The bottom will fall out.

453
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:01,416
Come.

454
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:10,259
Be careful. This may be a dream,
but you can still lose your head.

455
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:24,606
Which would you choose, a world with
pyramids or one without them?

456
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:26,150
Pyramids?

457
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:31,113
Humanity dreams of flight,
but the dream is cursed.

458
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:35,951
Aircraft are destined to become
tools for slaughter and destruction.

459
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:37,119
I know.

460
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:41,623
But still, I chose a world
with pyramids in it.

461
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,626
Which world will you choose?

462
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:48,130
I want to create beautiful airplanes.

463
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:49,631
Like that?

464
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:07,316
Very graceful.

465
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:11,778
I have a long way to go.
I don't even have the engine yet.

466
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:25,167
Bravo! A beautiful dream.

467
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:36,011
I'm retiring.
This is my last design.

468
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:39,514
Artists are only creative
for ten years.

469
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:42,684
We engineers are no different.

470
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:48,023
Live your ten years to the full.

471
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:06,708
Jiro, we need to talk.

472
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:08,877
- I've got a meeting.
- Cancel it.

473
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,730
- This is a tall order.
- They're always tall.

474
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:31,400
How long have you
been with us, Jiro?

475
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:33,902
Jiro?

476
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:36,405
- How long?
- Five years.

477
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:40,242
You should be ready, then.
We want you to lead the project.

478
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:43,912
It's the Navy's design competition
for 1932. A carrier-based fighter.

479
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:45,414
A plum assignment.

480
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:49,960
Well, Jiro?

481
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:02,764
What do you think?

482
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:04,474
Leave it to me.

483
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:05,934
Good.

484
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:08,103
I'd like Honjo on the team.

485
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:09,479
Bad idea.

486
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:13,275
You'd end up competing.
Friendship's more important.

487
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,777
Relax and finish your coffee.

488
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:18,280
Check, please.

489
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:21,450
We've got other plans for Honjo.

490
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:09,998
Damn these Japanese engines!

491
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:22,844
And damn this short flight deck.

492
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:29,184
Fresh uniforms!

493
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:31,228
Oh, thanks.

494
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:44,866
Thanks for your help.

495
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:46,201
Those jerseys suit you.

496
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:15,063
Close the flight deck!

497
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:09,284
Stop!

498
01:04:11,472 --> 01:04:12,847
We did it!

499
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:14,683
She's airborne!

500
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:21,916
Father!

501
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:11,341
Bravo! Nice catch.

502
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:18,139
That was kind of you.
Are you all right?

503
01:06:18,265 --> 01:06:19,808
I'm fine. Here you are.

504
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:22,977
Thank you.
It belongs to the hotel.

505
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:24,479
Well, goodbye.

506
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:40,995
Father, I'm afraid
I was rude to that man.

507
01:06:41,288 --> 01:06:43,331
Don't worry.
He's staying at our hotel.

508
01:06:43,624 --> 01:06:46,543
You'll have a chance
to say thank you.

509
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:32,834
What is it?

510
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:36,838
Nothing. Just that man
who caught the parasol.

511
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:40,008
He seems to be here by himself.

512
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,289
I'm sorry. I'd better go.

513
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:59,087
No, please stay.
I was giving thanks to the spring.

514
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:03,424
I asked it
to bring you here, to me.

515
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:11,474
You haven't changed at all.
You're just like you were then.

516
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:15,979
We were so grateful
for your help after the earthquake.

517
01:11:16,271 --> 01:11:19,315
I wanted to see you
again and thank you.

518
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:21,484
Oh, now I remember.

519
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,487
My name is Nahoko Satomi.

520
01:11:25,614 --> 01:11:27,323
Jiro Horikoshi.

521
01:11:49,304 --> 01:11:50,847
Are you all right?

522
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,348
I'm fine.

523
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:58,688
Kinu got married two days after
she dropped off your shirt.

524
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:02,442
She cried for joy
when we found you.

525
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:06,029
You were our knight
in shining armor.

526
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:07,196
Your knight?

527
01:12:07,322 --> 01:12:10,700
You were like a knight on a
white horse that day.

528
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:13,536
This umbrella sure does leak.

529
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:15,204
It's all right.

530
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:17,206
I've got to tell Kinu.

531
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:20,710
She just had her second child.

532
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:22,837
It's such a cute baby.

533
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:28,551
Your painting is all wet.

534
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:31,721
Yes. I'll keep it this way
in honor of today.

535
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:34,057
Look, it's clearing up.

536
01:12:41,356 --> 01:12:42,732
The rain stopped here.

537
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:46,569
Oh, look at that.

538
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:57,080
I'd almost forgotten
what rainbows look like.

539
01:12:57,372 --> 01:12:59,582
Life is wonderful, isn't it?

540
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:04,253
We'd better go.
Father's probably worried sick.

541
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:10,093
There's my father.

542
01:13:10,385 --> 01:13:12,595
Father!

543
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:16,099
Come, I'll introduce you.

544
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:20,269
You're soaking wet.

545
01:13:20,395 --> 01:13:25,441
Don't worry, Father. I'm fine.
Mr. Horikoshi saved me again.

546
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:26,943
Jiro Horikoshi.

547
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:31,572
Satomi. I'm afraid my daughter has
caused you trouble again.

548
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:18,828
May I sit here?

549
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:21,831
Certainly.

550
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:42,935
German tobacco. Last one. Too bad.

551
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:48,191
I know how you feel.
The same thing happened to me.

552
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:52,945
You visit Germany, yes? To Dessau.

553
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:56,449
You must be Sherlock Holmes.

554
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:58,868
You are an engineer.

555
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:03,206
You read German magazines.
Magazines about airplanes.

556
01:15:03,498 --> 01:15:07,210
All Japanese engineers visit Dessau.

557
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:11,214
You're exactly right.

558
01:15:12,507 --> 01:15:16,510
- Dr. Junkers is in trouble.
- What kind of trouble?

559
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:22,225
He fights the government.
He will blow up.

560
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:24,727
Mr. Hitler's government?

561
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:28,231
The Nazis are a gang of hoodlums.

562
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:31,067
This is a good place.

563
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:35,738
No mosquitoes.
Not hot. Good watercress.

564
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:38,699
A good place to forget bad things.

565
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:41,244
Cigarette? I'm afraid they're Japanese.

566
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:42,578
Thank you.

567
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:52,255
It is a nice night.
Hier ist der Zauberberg.

568
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:54,465
"The Magic Mountain"
by Thomas Mann?

569
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:57,260
A good place for forgetting.

570
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:00,596
Make a war in China. Forget it.

571
01:16:01,056 --> 01:16:03,849
Make a puppet state
in Manchuria. Forget it.

572
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:07,270
Quit the League of Nations. Forget it.

573
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:10,106
Make the world your enemy. Forget it.

574
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:12,775
Japan will blow up.

575
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:15,778
Germany will blow up too.

576
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:20,449
- Will Germany go to war again?
- Yes. They must be stopped.

577
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:24,662
I'm sorry to keep you
waiting so long.

578
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:27,290
Nahoko has a fever.

579
01:16:27,582 --> 01:16:30,459
I'm afraid we'll have to
cancel our dinner plans.

580
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:34,463
I'm sorry. Please tell her
I hope she feels better.

581
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:37,800
I must go.
The doctor will be here soon.

582
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:36,419
"Who has seen the wind?"

583
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:39,588
"Neither I nor you."

584
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:44,760
"But when the leaves hang trembling,
the wind is passing through."

585
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:52,601
Let the wind carry...

586
01:18:53,728 --> 01:18:55,813
these wings to you.

587
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:33,350
Jiro?

588
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:34,810
Nahoko!

589
01:19:55,123 --> 01:19:56,665
Be careful!

590
01:21:56,453 --> 01:21:57,703
Nice catch.

591
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:14,530
Bravo!

592
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:17,366
Is the young lady feeling better?

593
01:23:17,992 --> 01:23:19,868
Yes, she's much better.

594
01:23:19,994 --> 01:23:21,370
Congratulations.

595
01:23:22,163 --> 01:23:25,207
This is the magic mountain.
It cures everyone.

596
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:27,376
I think you're right.

597
01:23:28,002 --> 01:23:32,214
At first, this young man
was very gloomy.

598
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:34,383
Now he is very happy.

599
01:23:35,009 --> 01:23:36,593
He has fallen in love.

600
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:38,554
That's true.

601
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:42,558
Summer love is soon forgotten.

602
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:46,395
You will go down the mountain.
You will forget what happened here.

603
01:23:47,021 --> 01:23:48,564
Not me.

604
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:53,402
This person you're talking about
wouldn't be my daughter, would it?

605
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:55,738
Yes, it's Nahoko.

606
01:23:57,532 --> 01:24:00,117
Please give us your permission.

607
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:02,745
But...

608
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:04,079
Father!

609
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:08,167
I would like to accept.

610
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:10,419
What a beauty.

611
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:16,759
But first, there's something
I have to tell you.

612
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:17,885
Yes?

613
01:24:18,386 --> 01:24:22,097
Two years ago,
my mother died of tuberculosis.

614
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:25,100
I contracted it too.

615
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:29,855
I've loved you since
that day you rescued my hat.

616
01:24:30,565 --> 01:24:34,276
I've loved you since the wind
brought you to me.

617
01:24:35,069 --> 01:24:36,779
Please marry me.

618
01:24:36,905 --> 01:24:37,905
I will.

619
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:42,117
But I want to get well first.
Can you wait for me?

620
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:45,120
Even if it takes
a hundred years.

621
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:47,289
Congratulations.

622
01:24:47,415 --> 01:24:52,044
He is a nice young man.
Your daughter is wonderful.

623
01:24:53,087 --> 01:24:56,006
This is a good summer.

624
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:21,323
- Jiro, over here!
- Honjo!

625
01:25:21,449 --> 01:25:23,659
- When did you get back?
- Two days ago.

626
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:25,327
Hot, isn't it?

627
01:25:28,122 --> 01:25:29,998
Come take a look.

628
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:36,171
She's beautiful.

629
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:38,340
Good clean lines.

630
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:45,848
It's a radical design.
They gave me free rein.

631
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:49,184
But we won't know
until she flies.

632
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:53,188
She'll fly.
I feel the wind rising.

633
01:26:14,168 --> 01:26:18,213
You're the Japanese Achilles.
You've closed the gap.

634
01:26:19,173 --> 01:26:21,049
My plane was just a tin duckling.

635
01:26:21,175 --> 01:26:22,885
I have an idea for you.

636
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:25,554
I haven't tried it yet.

637
01:26:28,182 --> 01:26:30,893
Use flathead screws
on the access hatches.

638
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:32,728
They'll reduce drag.

639
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:37,399
Maintenance will be easy
with a hinge on one side.

640
01:26:42,363 --> 01:26:45,407
A spring about this stiff
should be fine.

641
01:26:45,533 --> 01:26:49,328
That's a great idea,
like Columbus and his egg.

642
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:50,579
You should use it.

643
01:26:51,372 --> 01:26:53,248
Thanks, but not this time.

644
01:26:55,209 --> 01:26:56,710
I'll keep the plans.

645
01:26:56,878 --> 01:27:00,088
After you use it,
I'll use it too.

646
01:27:01,215 --> 01:27:02,257
Okay.

647
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:04,885
Hurry up, I'll be waiting.

648
01:27:05,553 --> 01:27:07,763
Jiro! Are you here?

649
01:27:08,389 --> 01:27:10,766
Jiro, it's Mr. Kurokawa.

650
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:12,100
It's an emergency.

651
01:27:12,393 --> 01:27:13,435
See you.

652
01:27:13,728 --> 01:27:15,437
Visit the house next time.

653
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:17,272
Jiro, you pedal.

654
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:24,947
The Special Police
are looking for you.

655
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:28,283
The thought crime boys.

656
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:30,118
Why me?

657
01:27:30,244 --> 01:27:32,454
I told them you were
away on business.

658
01:27:43,758 --> 01:27:46,635
Pretending to leave?
We won't fall for that.

659
01:27:46,928 --> 01:27:49,471
You'd better work here.
We'll bring your things.

660
01:27:49,597 --> 01:27:52,474
What's going on?
Why are they after me?

661
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:57,980
They arrested some of my friends.
None of them understood why.

662
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:00,482
Come in.

663
01:28:00,608 --> 01:28:01,984
Here's your stuff.

664
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:05,821
Sorry for the bother.

665
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:07,489
Need anything else?

666
01:28:07,782 --> 01:28:10,492
- Just leave it and go.
- Jiro, it's here!

667
01:28:10,618 --> 01:28:12,494
The prototype flange.

668
01:28:22,797 --> 01:28:24,339
It looks great.

669
01:28:24,465 --> 01:28:26,341
Wish we'd had it last year.

670
01:28:26,634 --> 01:28:28,135
Jiro, what do you think?

671
01:28:28,803 --> 01:28:32,514
Our next plane will be
a full-grown duck, not a duckling.

672
01:28:33,808 --> 01:28:35,851
A full metal duck.

673
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:37,602
How about it, Mr. Kurokawa?

674
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:42,190
Extruded aluminum alloy.
Very light. What a luxury.

675
01:28:42,316 --> 01:28:43,942
All right, back to work.

676
01:28:55,872 --> 01:28:58,540
- The coast looks clear.
- Okay, Jiro.

677
01:29:00,376 --> 01:29:03,045
Better lie low for a few days.

678
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:05,213
We'll smooth things over.

679
01:29:05,381 --> 01:29:07,049
I'll put you up.

680
01:29:07,216 --> 01:29:10,177
Let me stop by my apartment.
I'm expecting a letter.

681
01:29:11,054 --> 01:29:12,554
Is it something sensitive?

682
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:14,222
Yes, very sensitive.

683
01:29:14,557 --> 01:29:16,558
The police will be opening your mail.

684
01:29:16,726 --> 01:29:18,143
It's from my fiance.

685
01:29:18,394 --> 01:29:21,897
Such things shouldn't happen
in a modern country.

686
01:29:23,733 --> 01:29:25,400
You're engaged?

687
01:29:26,235 --> 01:29:28,403
- Jiro's human after all.
- Splendid.

688
01:29:28,571 --> 01:29:30,739
You think Japan's a modern country?

689
01:29:30,907 --> 01:29:32,282
It's not funny.

690
01:29:32,575 --> 01:29:35,911
Of course it's not funny.
The police are waiting for you.

691
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:38,288
Let them read your love letters.

692
01:29:38,748 --> 01:29:41,917
The Navy's next design
competition is in your hands.

693
01:29:42,251 --> 01:29:46,922
The company will protect you.
That is, as long as you're useful.

694
01:29:47,590 --> 01:29:49,424
Just keep your mind on work.

695
01:29:50,593 --> 01:29:54,096
I miss you terribly.
And "Mr. Castorp" left so suddenly.

696
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:57,599
Why are they looking for him?

697
01:30:09,946 --> 01:30:15,033
I pray that he managed to
leave Japan safely.

698
01:30:32,468 --> 01:30:34,136
Jiro, telephone for you.

699
01:30:34,804 --> 01:30:35,804
Coming.

700
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:38,640
- The telephone is there.
- Thank you.

701
01:30:41,060 --> 01:30:44,479
- Hello?
- Jiro? You have a telegram.

702
01:30:44,647 --> 01:30:45,605
What?

703
01:30:45,731 --> 01:30:50,152
Your landlord brought it.
It came two days ago.

704
01:30:50,653 --> 01:30:51,820
Please read it.

705
01:30:52,155 --> 01:30:53,155
Are you sure?

706
01:30:55,324 --> 01:30:59,911
"Nahoko... has had
a lung... hemorrhage."

707
01:31:00,037 --> 01:31:02,497
"Please come at once.
Satomi"

708
01:31:09,672 --> 01:31:11,339
Hello? Are you there?

709
01:31:12,175 --> 01:31:14,176
I understand. Thank you.

710
01:31:14,343 --> 01:31:15,844
Wait, hold on!

711
01:31:18,681 --> 01:31:19,681
What is it?

712
01:31:21,184 --> 01:31:23,935
What's the fastest way
to get to Tokyo?

713
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:25,520
To Tokyo?

714
01:31:25,688 --> 01:31:28,190
I have to be there
as soon as possible.

715
01:31:28,357 --> 01:31:30,025
Let me see.

716
01:31:30,359 --> 01:31:34,362
If you take the noon bus,
you can catch the express.

717
01:31:34,530 --> 01:31:37,532
I'll send someone
to hold the bus for you.

718
01:31:38,201 --> 01:31:39,201
Jiya!

719
01:33:26,809 --> 01:33:27,809
Darling!

720
01:33:37,987 --> 01:33:39,988
I wish I could've
come sooner.

721
01:33:45,661 --> 01:33:47,162
You'll catch it.

722
01:33:47,496 --> 01:33:48,830
You're beautiful.

723
01:33:49,665 --> 01:33:50,999
I love you.

724
01:33:53,336 --> 01:33:55,170
Jiro? Through the garden?

725
01:34:04,847 --> 01:34:06,181
Come in.

726
01:34:08,017 --> 01:34:10,852
Father, Jiro came to see me.

727
01:34:11,187 --> 01:34:13,521
But he has to leave right away.

728
01:34:14,023 --> 01:34:18,193
- Next time I'll use the front door.
- Use the garden, it's more fun.

729
01:34:18,694 --> 01:34:20,195
All right, I will.

730
01:34:20,529 --> 01:34:22,530
Take care, darling.

731
01:34:23,032 --> 01:34:24,199
You too.

732
01:34:25,701 --> 01:34:27,202
Goodbye.

733
01:34:27,370 --> 01:34:28,536
I'll see you out.

734
01:34:33,876 --> 01:34:36,878
The last train?
You'd better hurry.

735
01:34:38,756 --> 01:34:42,550
Is it that serious?
I wish I could look after her.

736
01:34:42,885 --> 01:34:46,054
The way to do that is
to focus on your work.

737
01:34:46,389 --> 01:34:47,889
Now you'd better go.

738
01:34:55,398 --> 01:34:56,898
He's gone.

739
01:34:57,900 --> 01:34:59,901
Are you crying, dear?

740
01:35:02,405 --> 01:35:07,242
I'm going to the sanatorium
the doctor recommended.

741
01:35:07,576 --> 01:35:10,912
But it's so lonely.
You'll be all by yourself.

742
01:35:11,747 --> 01:35:13,415
I want to get better.

743
01:35:13,707 --> 01:35:15,750
I want a life with Jiro.

744
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:24,426
You're just in time.
The board is waiting.

745
01:35:31,434 --> 01:35:33,184
So, are you ready?

746
01:35:34,103 --> 01:35:35,687
I'll do my best.

747
01:35:35,938 --> 01:35:38,606
Now the Navy.
They're the client.

748
01:35:49,618 --> 01:35:51,202
I'll do my best.

749
01:35:51,328 --> 01:35:53,955
- You weren't even listening.
- Right.

750
01:35:56,459 --> 01:35:58,626
So I gave up on that idea.

751
01:36:00,629 --> 01:36:04,799
- Everyone's here rather late.
- Jiro's holding a design seminar.

752
01:36:07,094 --> 01:36:10,305
The next design uses
all the latest technology.

753
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:13,475
- Take a look.
- Retractable undercarriage!

754
01:36:13,601 --> 01:36:16,144
We'll need it for 270 knots.

755
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:19,606
270 knots?
That's 500 kilometers an hour!

756
01:36:19,982 --> 01:36:22,358
I thought the Navy
requested 220 knots.

757
01:36:22,985 --> 01:36:25,320
We're designing for the future.

758
01:36:25,988 --> 01:36:28,490
Wing loading is 120 kilos
per square meter.

759
01:36:28,991 --> 01:36:33,161
We'll minimize drag
and push the limits of technology.

760
01:36:33,829 --> 01:36:36,664
She'll have split flaps
and leading edge slats.

761
01:36:53,349 --> 01:36:55,016
We can do it!

762
01:36:55,434 --> 01:36:57,393
When do we start?

763
01:36:58,187 --> 01:37:00,396
But then weight becomes a problem.

764
01:37:03,526 --> 01:37:06,528
If we leave out the guns,
we should be okay.

765
01:37:12,868 --> 01:37:16,037
I decided to set
this idea aside for now.

766
01:37:17,206 --> 01:37:19,207
This is delightful.
Lucid and logical.

767
01:37:19,542 --> 01:37:20,792
Almost had it.

768
01:37:21,377 --> 01:37:23,336
Our engines are underpowered.

769
01:37:23,462 --> 01:37:26,548
To compensate, we need
a light, strong structure.

770
01:37:26,715 --> 01:37:30,885
We'll cut excess weight
and minimize drag with a smooth skin.

771
01:37:31,053 --> 01:37:33,721
We're going to build
an all-metal fighter...

772
01:37:33,889 --> 01:37:36,057
like nothing the world's ever seen.

773
01:37:36,559 --> 01:37:38,226
I have a question!

774
01:37:38,561 --> 01:37:40,061
Mr. Hirayama, please.

775
01:37:41,230 --> 01:37:44,232
Mr. Hirayama is our production engineer.

776
01:37:44,733 --> 01:37:45,525
Thank you.

777
01:37:47,861 --> 01:37:50,738
He's going to tell us
about the new rivets.

778
01:37:51,532 --> 01:37:57,036
It's technically possible to build
strong structures with flush rivets.

779
01:37:57,246 --> 01:37:58,580
What's he talking about?

780
01:37:59,081 --> 01:38:00,540
A way to cut drag.

781
01:38:00,833 --> 01:38:06,129
We're going to skin
the whole aircraft with flush rivets.

782
01:38:06,255 --> 01:38:08,590
- Question!
- I have a question!

783
01:38:11,093 --> 01:38:13,428
I must say, that was interesting.

784
01:38:13,596 --> 01:38:15,096
It was inspiring.

785
01:38:35,451 --> 01:38:37,452
Today's letter, Miss Satomi.

786
01:38:37,786 --> 01:38:39,454
Thank you.

787
01:39:59,034 --> 01:40:00,535
Phone call, Chief.

788
01:40:00,869 --> 01:40:03,830
- I'll call back.
- I think it's an emergency.

789
01:40:04,039 --> 01:40:07,208
Hello? Mr. Satomi?

790
01:40:07,876 --> 01:40:09,377
What?!

791
01:41:22,284 --> 01:41:24,285
Jiro! Jiro!

792
01:41:24,620 --> 01:41:28,122
Thank goodness.
I worried I wouldn't find you.

793
01:41:29,917 --> 01:41:32,627
I'm here now. Can you walk?

794
01:41:33,796 --> 01:41:34,962
Let's go.

795
01:41:42,179 --> 01:41:45,306
I just had to see you.
I should go right back.

796
01:41:45,474 --> 01:41:46,307
Don't go.

797
01:41:50,145 --> 01:41:51,813
We should be together.

798
01:42:04,493 --> 01:42:07,161
- What a charming companion.
- My name is Nahoko.

799
01:42:07,329 --> 01:42:09,997
- So you're Nahoko.
- Jiro, is that you?

800
01:42:10,165 --> 01:42:12,333
We've come to you
with a request.

801
01:42:13,335 --> 01:42:15,336
Why not, dear? It'll be fine.

802
01:42:15,504 --> 01:42:17,171
We've got plenty of room...

803
01:42:17,339 --> 01:42:22,510
but I can hardly approve of
an unmarried couple living together.

804
01:42:23,178 --> 01:42:24,679
We'll get married right away.

805
01:42:24,805 --> 01:42:27,765
Mr. Kurokawa, Mrs. Kurokawa,
please be our witnesses.

806
01:42:28,016 --> 01:42:29,350
Here? Tonight?

807
01:42:29,518 --> 01:42:31,519
It sounds lovely, dear.

808
01:42:31,687 --> 01:42:35,022
Nahoko was very brave
to leave the sanatorium.

809
01:42:35,524 --> 01:42:39,527
My father's given his permission.
I've already told the doctor.

810
01:42:39,862 --> 01:42:41,028
Please help us.

811
01:42:43,824 --> 01:42:46,701
The bride and I have
preparations to make.

812
01:42:47,202 --> 01:42:48,703
Come with me, Nahoko.

813
01:42:54,710 --> 01:42:57,378
Don't worry, he's always like that.

814
01:43:01,383 --> 01:43:06,220
If you care about her,
you'll send her back immediately.

815
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:11,559
I can't do that.
I'd have to give up my work.

816
01:43:11,894 --> 01:43:15,062
Is that your heart
or your ego talking?

817
01:43:16,064 --> 01:43:19,317
We don't have much time.
We've made our decision.

818
01:43:20,569 --> 01:43:21,736
I see.

819
01:43:22,571 --> 01:43:25,072
All right.
We'll have a real ceremony!

820
01:43:49,848 --> 01:43:51,098
Here they come.

821
01:43:52,559 --> 01:43:53,601
She's coming!

822
01:44:12,955 --> 01:44:18,125
Hear me! This lovely maiden
has traveled far to join her beloved.

823
01:44:18,460 --> 01:44:23,798
She's given up everything
in the world for him. What say you?

824
01:44:24,299 --> 01:44:27,301
Hear me! This man is
an insensitive simpleton...

825
01:44:27,469 --> 01:44:29,637
without a home
of his own.

826
01:44:29,805 --> 01:44:33,140
If that's... uh, okay with you,
please come in.

827
01:44:33,308 --> 01:44:36,811
Then they shall exchange
the marriage vows.

828
01:44:59,501 --> 01:45:00,835
You look beautiful.

829
01:45:37,539 --> 01:45:39,540
Mr. and Mrs. Kurokawa.

830
01:45:40,042 --> 01:45:44,879
No words can express
our gratitude for your kindness.

831
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:47,548
We will never forget our debt to you.

832
01:45:50,385 --> 01:45:55,389
Come now, we're delighted that
Jiro's found such a wonderful partner.

833
01:45:55,724 --> 01:45:56,557
Aren't we, dear?

834
01:45:56,725 --> 01:46:00,895
Of course. This is wonderful.
You're both very courageous.

835
01:46:16,912 --> 01:46:18,079
You must be tired.

836
01:46:18,580 --> 01:46:22,583
I feel like I'm dreaming.
The room is spinning.

837
01:46:22,918 --> 01:46:25,044
Better get some rest.

838
01:46:26,254 --> 01:46:27,171
Come here.

839
01:46:27,589 --> 01:46:28,923
But your condition...

840
01:46:31,093 --> 01:46:32,259
Come.

841
01:47:14,052 --> 01:47:16,637
Do you always
get home this late?

842
01:47:16,763 --> 01:47:18,347
Kayo, I completely forgot.

843
01:47:18,723 --> 01:47:20,599
You're so insensitive.

844
01:47:22,394 --> 01:47:24,937
Congratulations on becoming a doctor.

845
01:47:25,063 --> 01:47:27,940
Congratulations on your marriage.

846
01:47:28,233 --> 01:47:31,777
I came on behalf of the family
to thank the Kurokawas.

847
01:47:32,070 --> 01:47:33,279
Are they still up?

848
01:47:33,488 --> 01:47:34,947
They've gone to bed.

849
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:37,283
- Did you meet Nahoko?
- Yes.

850
01:47:41,246 --> 01:47:46,125
What are you going to do?
She's alone in that room all day.

851
01:47:46,585 --> 01:47:50,087
Her condition is
much worse than you think.

852
01:47:50,255 --> 01:47:53,132
I'm an intern.
I know something about this.

853
01:47:53,758 --> 01:47:58,971
Did you notice she uses rouge
every morning so you won't worry?

854
01:48:00,432 --> 01:48:03,976
I really like Nahoko.
She's such a good person.

855
01:48:04,102 --> 01:48:06,270
How can you do this to her?

856
01:48:10,817 --> 01:48:13,152
Does she really have to stay here?

857
01:48:13,278 --> 01:48:14,320
Yes.

858
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:19,658
Each day is very precious to us now.

859
01:48:22,120 --> 01:48:25,164
Get some rest.
I'm glad you came to visit.

860
01:48:40,472 --> 01:48:41,680
I'm home.

861
01:48:41,806 --> 01:48:44,016
- I was waiting.
- You should sleep.

862
01:48:50,315 --> 01:48:53,525
- Should you be up?
- Kayo came today.

863
01:48:54,319 --> 01:48:56,528
We're already best friends.

864
01:48:57,656 --> 01:49:01,533
She's like the sun,
with such a bright future.

865
01:49:01,993 --> 01:49:06,038
She said next time,
she'll come as my doctor.

866
01:49:07,499 --> 01:49:12,211
And your mother made me
a chemise and a nightgown.

867
01:49:12,671 --> 01:49:14,588
Look, they're so warm.

868
01:49:15,674 --> 01:49:16,799
Too bright?

869
01:49:17,676 --> 01:49:18,801
It's all right.

870
01:49:21,012 --> 01:49:23,389
I have to finish
the design by tomorrow.

871
01:49:23,682 --> 01:49:24,890
For your mackerel bones?

872
01:49:25,517 --> 01:49:26,725
You remembered.

873
01:49:27,644 --> 01:49:30,396
I think it could
be a little lighter.

874
01:49:32,691 --> 01:49:34,441
Come a little closer.

875
01:49:43,868 --> 01:49:45,411
Give me your hand.

876
01:49:48,707 --> 01:49:52,918
I like to look at you
while you work.

877
01:49:53,545 --> 01:49:58,257
In a one-handed slide rule contest,
I'd win first prize for sure.

878
01:49:59,384 --> 01:50:02,428
I think I can make each rib
half an ounce lighter.

879
01:50:02,721 --> 01:50:04,430
Really? That's good.

880
01:50:04,723 --> 01:50:06,765
Thirty ribs makes about a pound.

881
01:50:07,058 --> 01:50:08,392
That's too much.

882
01:50:08,893 --> 01:50:11,395
Half a pound is enough for two.

883
01:50:11,896 --> 01:50:16,108
I could eat a pound
of mackerel by myself.

884
01:50:21,906 --> 01:50:24,283
I'll keep holding your hand.
You should sleep.

885
01:50:24,409 --> 01:50:27,619
- You won't let go?
- No, I won't.

886
01:50:30,081 --> 01:50:33,459
I need a cigarette.
Can I let go for a minute?

887
01:50:33,752 --> 01:50:36,128
No. Smoke it here.

888
01:50:36,421 --> 01:50:38,630
- It's not good for you.
- I don't care.

889
01:50:58,109 --> 01:50:59,651
Hey, Honjo.

890
01:50:59,944 --> 01:51:01,320
Can I take a look?

891
01:51:01,613 --> 01:51:04,531
- Sure. How's your bomber?
- Coming along fine.

892
01:51:04,783 --> 01:51:08,827
This is avant garde.
You went all the way.

893
01:51:12,123 --> 01:51:14,333
So this is flush riveting.

894
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:17,169
Feels pretty rough.

895
01:51:18,296 --> 01:51:20,005
We're still learning the technique.

896
01:51:20,298 --> 01:51:25,177
You've left the Germans behind.
I'm still stuck with them.

897
01:51:27,722 --> 01:51:31,975
This design is you,
right down to the mackerel bones.

898
01:51:34,312 --> 01:51:39,525
Jiro, let me use flush rivets too.
And your spring-loaded hatches.

899
01:51:39,651 --> 01:51:41,360
Sure. Why not?

900
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:42,694
A redesign?

901
01:51:42,821 --> 01:51:47,032
Yeah, but they're only letting me
modify the fuselage.

902
01:51:47,492 --> 01:51:48,867
And leave the wings alone?

903
01:51:49,160 --> 01:51:52,246
That's where the fuel tanks are.
One hit, and boom.

904
01:51:52,831 --> 01:51:56,542
To save weight, we're not even
shielding the fuel tanks.

905
01:51:56,668 --> 01:52:00,671
It's Japan's first advanced bomber.
The Navy's over the moon.

906
01:52:02,674 --> 01:52:06,552
She's got to fly 3,000 kilometers
with a big payload.

907
01:52:07,011 --> 01:52:09,555
More horsepower alone won't be enough.

908
01:52:22,777 --> 01:52:24,570
Who are they going to fight?

909
01:52:24,696 --> 01:52:28,740
China. Russia. Britain.
The Netherlands. America.

910
01:52:28,867 --> 01:52:30,242
Japan will blow up.

911
01:52:31,202 --> 01:52:35,080
We're not arms merchants.
We just want to build good aircraft.

912
01:52:35,206 --> 01:52:36,081
You're right.

913
01:52:36,207 --> 01:52:38,083
See you. Get some sleep.

914
01:52:38,209 --> 01:52:40,127
Sure. You too.

915
01:52:41,379 --> 01:52:42,754
I'm leaving now.

916
01:52:43,047 --> 01:52:44,256
Good night.

917
01:52:44,883 --> 01:52:45,799
Night.

918
01:53:11,075 --> 01:53:12,618
Welcome home.

919
01:53:13,077 --> 01:53:16,121
It's finished.
Now we'll see how she flies.

920
01:53:16,414 --> 01:53:19,458
Congratulations.
You worked so hard.

921
01:53:20,335 --> 01:53:23,003
She's on her way to the field.

922
01:53:23,254 --> 01:53:25,797
I'll probably spend
a few nights there.

923
01:53:26,758 --> 01:53:28,467
You must be tired.

924
01:53:30,762 --> 01:53:32,262
A little.

925
01:53:32,430 --> 01:53:34,473
I'm sure it will fly beautifully.

926
01:53:34,933 --> 01:53:37,267
Yes, she'll fly.

927
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:40,854
I couldn't have done it without you.

928
01:53:41,272 --> 01:53:43,315
I love you, Jiro.

929
01:53:44,108 --> 01:53:45,484
Nahoko...

930
01:54:38,663 --> 01:54:39,871
I'm off.

931
01:54:39,998 --> 01:54:41,373
Good luck.

932
01:55:07,859 --> 01:55:09,610
Why, Nahoko. You're up.

933
01:55:10,153 --> 01:55:14,906
I'm feeling much better today.
I'm going for a walk.

934
01:55:15,033 --> 01:55:17,909
Just be careful
not to tire yourself.

935
01:55:19,037 --> 01:55:23,248
The room's still a mess.
I'll straighten up when I get back.

936
01:55:23,750 --> 01:55:25,917
All right. Enjoy yourself.

937
01:55:26,044 --> 01:55:28,754
Kayo's coming today.
That will be nice.

938
01:55:29,047 --> 01:55:30,922
Yes. I'll be back soon.

939
01:56:12,423 --> 01:56:14,466
Please come in.

940
01:56:20,598 --> 01:56:22,474
Oh, no.

941
01:56:31,109 --> 01:56:34,403
Look, she left letters!
One of them's for me.

942
01:56:40,284 --> 01:56:44,496
She's going to the sanatorium!
I'll bring her back.

943
01:56:44,789 --> 01:56:46,164
No! Let her go.

944
01:56:49,127 --> 01:56:52,671
We shouldn't do anything
until her train leaves.

945
01:56:54,298 --> 01:56:58,009
She wants him
to remember her as she was.

946
01:57:44,932 --> 01:57:48,685
This is wonderful.
Just think, that's one of ours.

947
01:57:48,895 --> 01:57:50,896
How's her speed?

948
01:57:51,189 --> 01:57:54,483
Sorry, the numbers are too high.
We're checking them again.

949
01:57:54,692 --> 01:57:55,901
How fast?

950
01:57:56,027 --> 01:57:59,237
- 240 knots.
- Two forty!

951
01:58:34,440 --> 01:58:37,442
- Fantastic!
- What a fighter.

952
01:58:38,736 --> 01:58:40,111
Hey, Jiro.

953
01:58:40,571 --> 01:58:41,780
Jiro!

954
01:58:49,747 --> 01:58:52,624
She flies like a dream.
Thank you.

955
02:00:05,364 --> 02:00:08,742
We meet again, Japanese boy.

956
02:00:09,994 --> 02:00:11,202
Mr. Caproni...

957
02:00:14,916 --> 02:00:18,043
This is where we first met.

958
02:00:18,169 --> 02:00:20,545
Our kingdom of dreams.

959
02:00:21,088 --> 02:00:22,714
Or the land of the dead.

960
02:00:22,840 --> 02:00:25,717
Not quite. In some ways, yes.

961
02:00:26,177 --> 02:00:30,138
Those ten years in the sun,
did you live them to the full?

962
02:00:30,264 --> 02:00:33,058
Yes. Things fell apart
toward the end, though.

963
02:00:33,351 --> 02:00:35,852
That's what it means to lose a war.

964
02:00:36,020 --> 02:00:38,563
There's your Zero fighter.

965
02:01:16,018 --> 02:01:18,770
Beautiful. A masterful design.

966
02:01:19,230 --> 02:01:21,439
Not a single plane returned.

967
02:01:21,691 --> 02:01:24,109
There was nothing
to come back to.

968
02:01:24,402 --> 02:01:27,404
Airplanes are beautiful dreams.
Cursed dreams...

969
02:01:27,655 --> 02:01:29,990
waiting for the sky
to swallow them up.

970
02:01:31,659 --> 02:01:33,451
Someone is waiting for you.

971
02:01:48,634 --> 02:01:49,634
Nahoko...

972
02:01:49,927 --> 02:01:53,096
She's been waiting here
for a long time.

973
02:01:53,597 --> 02:01:55,974
Darling, you must live.

974
02:02:00,312 --> 02:02:01,479
You must live...

975
02:02:23,794 --> 02:02:25,670
She is gone.

976
02:02:27,131 --> 02:02:29,507
She was beautiful, like the wind.

977
02:02:30,968 --> 02:02:34,679
Thank you.

978
02:02:36,223 --> 02:02:38,349
You must live.

979
02:02:38,642 --> 02:02:43,229
First, shall we drop by my house?
I have some excellent wine.

Voices
Hideaki Anno Miori Takimoto

982
02:03:14,011 --> 02:03:18,890
A white sloping path

983
02:03:20,017 --> 02:03:25,396
Runs up into the sky

984
02:03:25,689 --> 02:03:30,068
A gently swaying, misy haze

985
02:03:30,903 --> 02:03:35,406
Surrounding and holding

986
02:03:35,699 --> 02:03:41,412
Unnoticed by anyone, all alone

987
02:03:42,206 --> 02:03:47,418
Soaring upwards

988
02:03:47,878 --> 02:03:52,590
Not afraid of anything

989
02:03:52,883 --> 02:03:58,221
Dancing up

990
02:03:58,556 --> 02:04:03,768
Longing to be in the sky

991
02:04:04,061 --> 02:04:09,607
Speeding through the sky

992
02:04:10,067 --> 02:04:20,118
A whole life, a vapor trail

993
02:04:21,078 --> 02:04:25,790
Even before dying

994
02:04:26,959 --> 02:04:32,297
From that window, up high

995
02:04:32,590 --> 02:04:37,135
Watching the sky

996
02:04:37,928 --> 02:04:42,307
Now no one understands

997
02:04:42,933 --> 02:04:48,313
No one would understand

998
02:04:49,607 --> 02:04:59,824
All they could think was...
"Too young"

999
02:05:00,451 --> 02:05:05,371
Yet... happy

1000
02:05:05,789 --> 02:05:11,169
Longing to be in the sky

1001
02:05:11,295 --> 02:05:17,175
Speeding through the sky

1002
02:05:17,468 --> 02:05:27,352
A whole life, a vapor trail

1003
02:05:28,145 --> 02:05:33,358
Longing to be in the sky

1004
02:05:33,651 --> 02:05:39,030
Speeding through the sky

1005
02:05:39,657 --> 02:05:51,376
A whole life, a vapor trail
