26
00:00:11,859 --> 00:00:15,226
Since some time, some raids conducted by fake CBI...

27
00:00:15,296 --> 00:00:17,491
...has come up before CBI enquiry.

28
00:00:17,565 --> 00:00:21,524
Call us on this phone number for any doubtful situation.

29
00:02:53,287 --> 00:02:54,083
Hello, sir.

30
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:56,452
Why do you want to join the bureau?

31
00:02:56,824 --> 00:02:57,620
What, sir?

32
00:02:57,691 --> 00:02:58,776
Intelligence. CBI.

33
00:02:58,777 --> 00:03:00,524
Why do you want to join it?

34
00:03:01,128 --> 00:03:03,062
There's a lot of corruption in our country.

35
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,820
The entire system's in a mess.

36
00:03:04,898 --> 00:03:07,332
Our enemies are weakening our system.

37
00:03:07,434 --> 00:03:10,369
We need to uproot the enemies, sir.

38
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:11,765
Will you uproot them?

39
00:03:13,273 --> 00:03:14,672
We'll do it together, sir.

40
00:03:14,975 --> 00:03:16,772
You... and me.

41
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,403
Republic Day.

42
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:33,708
'Republic' is a word, which, if you look up its meaning...

43
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:38,240
...you see a the picture of a group of people...

44
00:05:38,352 --> 00:05:42,686
...which guides them to follow rules.

45
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:46,350
The same republic is called democracy as well.

46
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:55,496
The journey of India's Republic...

47
00:05:55,569 --> 00:06:00,404
...began 37 years ago, with 21 cannon salute...

48
00:06:00,507 --> 00:06:05,843
...and with Dr. Rajendra Prasad hoisting...

49
00:06:05,946 --> 00:06:09,040
...the Indian flag on 26th January, 1950...

50
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:13,449
...and announced the historical
birth of the Republic of India.

51
00:06:13,787 --> 00:06:15,254
Fourjunior constables and one lady constable...

52
00:06:15,355 --> 00:06:17,414
...along with you will be adequate.
- Yes.

53
00:06:17,491 --> 00:06:18,617
Where are we conducting the raid?

54
00:06:18,692 --> 00:06:20,489
Even I don't know that yet.

55
00:06:20,594 --> 00:06:22,118
Only Mr. Sharma knows for now.

56
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:25,027
Meet us at Safdurjung in 15 minutes.

57
00:06:27,968 --> 00:06:28,957
Ajay.

58
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:37,208
Sir, we're getting late.

59
00:06:40,847 --> 00:06:42,144
Sir, don't be tense.

60
00:06:42,216 --> 00:06:43,945
Do you want me to lead?

61
00:06:47,454 --> 00:06:50,446
Are you nervous because he's a minister...

62
00:06:53,493 --> 00:06:55,654
Ministers are not more important than the country.

63
00:06:56,663 --> 00:06:57,687
Did you call the police?

64
00:06:57,764 --> 00:06:58,731
Yes, I did.

65
00:06:58,832 --> 00:07:00,299
They will be at Safdurjung in 15 minutes.

66
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:02,062
Who is the SI?
- Ranveer Singh.

67
00:07:10,043 --> 00:07:11,408
Where is my staff?

68
00:07:12,179 --> 00:07:13,669
Sir.

69
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:41,261
Sir...

70
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,534
Your shoelace is untied.

71
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,749
The minister's home?

72
00:09:01,188 --> 00:09:02,416
Let's go.

73
00:09:56,143 --> 00:09:57,804
8% is not too much.

74
00:09:57,911 --> 00:10:00,243
Yourjob's not too easy.

75
00:10:00,347 --> 00:10:02,907
The minister's said yes, otherwise...

76
00:10:04,284 --> 00:10:05,842
Sir, we're from the CBI.

77
00:10:06,153 --> 00:10:07,677
We need to search your house.

78
00:10:07,788 --> 00:10:10,256
So what if you're the CBI, you cannot barge in like this...

79
00:10:13,727 --> 00:10:16,753
Sir. They're the CBI.

80
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,664
I think they're here to raid your house.

81
00:10:19,766 --> 00:10:20,630
Ajay.
- Sir.

82
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,962
Start.
- Yes, sir.

83
00:10:22,068 --> 00:10:23,092
You look that way.
- Ranveer.

84
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:23,795
And you look that way.

85
00:10:23,904 --> 00:10:24,871
Sir.

86
00:10:24,938 --> 00:10:26,963
If anyone tries to act smart, don't hesitate to slap them.

87
00:10:27,073 --> 00:10:28,005
Sir.

88
00:10:30,744 --> 00:10:32,109
Come on, hurry up.

89
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:34,511
Come on.
Everyone, get inside.

90
00:10:34,581 --> 00:10:35,741
Hurry up.

91
00:10:35,816 --> 00:10:37,044
Keep the phone down.
- I...

92
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,378
Keep it down.
Come on.

93
00:10:38,452 --> 00:10:40,079
No one will come out.

94
00:10:51,031 --> 00:10:55,229
Guddu's going to eat this hot sweetmeat.

95
00:10:55,302 --> 00:10:56,394
Eat it.

96
00:10:56,503 --> 00:10:58,095
Bravo.

97
00:10:58,171 --> 00:10:59,468
One more.

98
00:10:59,539 --> 00:11:01,370
Like this...

99
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:02,971
Who are you?

100
00:11:03,043 --> 00:11:04,510
You can't barge in here.

101
00:11:04,578 --> 00:11:06,603
The CBI has raided your house.

102
00:11:12,619 --> 00:11:14,143
Sir.

103
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:19,261
Listen.
Believe me,

104
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:20,924
there's nothing in here.

105
00:11:21,027 --> 00:11:22,551
Handover the cupboard keys.

106
00:11:22,662 --> 00:11:23,754
The key's lost, I don't have it.

107
00:11:23,864 --> 00:11:25,764
Stop joking, handover the keys.

108
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:27,764
Guddu's father, why don't you say something?

109
00:11:27,868 --> 00:11:29,301
Why is he asking for the keys?
- Sir.

110
00:11:29,369 --> 00:11:30,529
No point in calling him.

111
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,001
Handover the keys.
- What happened?

112
00:11:32,105 --> 00:11:33,333
Sir, she's not handing over the cupboard keys.

113
00:11:33,473 --> 00:11:34,565
I don't have it, so how can I...

114
00:11:34,674 --> 00:11:35,606
Break the lock.
- Yes.

115
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:37,540
Move aside, let him do his job.

116
00:11:37,644 --> 00:11:38,804
What are you doing?

117
00:11:38,912 --> 00:11:39,776
Stop.

118
00:11:39,846 --> 00:11:41,541
He's broken the lock.

119
00:11:41,615 --> 00:11:43,640
Oh God.

120
00:11:46,853 --> 00:11:49,481
Oh God.

121
00:11:51,024 --> 00:11:53,515
Sir.
The minister's salary.

122
00:11:57,564 --> 00:12:00,795
Look... at that they found from the cupboard.

123
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:02,664
Guddu's father.

124
00:12:02,969 --> 00:12:05,767
You never told me about these.

125
00:12:14,447 --> 00:12:15,607
Shanti.

126
00:12:15,682 --> 00:12:16,774
Sir.

127
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:18,611
There's nothing here.

128
00:12:18,685 --> 00:12:20,482
The Lord's resting here.

129
00:12:20,587 --> 00:12:22,282
Don't trouble Him.

130
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:23,481
There's nothing.

131
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:27,117
At least think about the Lord.
- Sir.

132
00:12:27,227 --> 00:12:27,944
What are you doing?

133
00:12:27,945 --> 00:12:28,660
You'll be cursed.

134
00:12:28,728 --> 00:12:29,864
Come on.
The Lord's omniscient One.

135
00:12:29,865 --> 00:12:30,559
He won't say a thing.

136
00:12:30,664 --> 00:12:31,517
He'll curse you.

137
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:33,064
- Madam, please step aside.

138
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:34,361
Sir.

139
00:12:34,768 --> 00:12:36,736
You're so mean.

140
00:12:39,205 --> 00:12:40,399
Quiet.

141
00:12:54,287 --> 00:12:55,254
Sir. This too.

142
00:13:27,053 --> 00:13:28,577
Stop.
- Take all this out.

143
00:13:28,655 --> 00:13:29,883
Stop.
- Just a minute.

144
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,116
Leave me.
Leave me.

145
00:13:31,224 --> 00:13:34,557
It's his hard earned money, don't take it away.

146
00:13:34,628 --> 00:13:37,153
Look, you're ruining my clothes.

147
00:13:37,263 --> 00:13:38,958
Let go.
- Guddu's father. Stop them.

148
00:13:39,065 --> 00:13:40,896
Let go.
- Come on, let go of his sweater.

149
00:13:40,967 --> 00:13:43,299
You should be thankful that you
still have the jewellery you're wearing.

150
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,304
You'll be cursed.

151
00:13:45,372 --> 00:13:48,068
We're ruined.

152
00:14:56,943 --> 00:14:58,171
Ajay.

153
00:15:54,134 --> 00:15:55,396
Sir, these are the documents.

154
00:15:55,502 --> 00:15:56,366
Look here, sir.

155
00:15:56,469 --> 00:15:58,232
These are land investments.

156
00:16:16,156 --> 00:16:17,316
Sir.

157
00:16:24,664 --> 00:16:25,688
Sign here.
- Here.

158
00:16:25,765 --> 00:16:27,164
I've one.

159
00:16:32,338 --> 00:16:35,967
Can we step aside for a minute, sir?

160
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:46,414
Sir, my PA's really ill-mannered.

161
00:16:46,486 --> 00:16:48,420
He doesn't have the etiquettes...

162
00:16:48,521 --> 00:16:52,218
...of how to talk to an officer of your calibre.

163
00:16:53,026 --> 00:16:54,459
He's completely insane.

164
00:16:55,161 --> 00:16:57,857
I was saying, sir...
- What's your offer?

165
00:17:03,336 --> 00:17:04,769
How much do you want?

166
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,669
Two?

167
00:17:06,739 --> 00:17:08,673
I think that will be fine.

168
00:17:09,242 --> 00:17:10,766
Two?
- Yes.

169
00:17:17,283 --> 00:17:18,545
P. K Sharma.

170
00:17:19,419 --> 00:17:20,977
Don't forget the name.

171
00:17:21,487 --> 00:17:23,648
And tell your other corrupt friends...

172
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,954
...to pray that the CBI don't raid their homes.

173
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:31,562
And if they do, then PK Sharma isn't conducting it.

174
00:17:50,183 --> 00:17:51,411
Sir.

175
00:17:52,018 --> 00:17:55,852
Thankfully, you offered him only two.

176
00:17:58,391 --> 00:17:59,449
Joginder.
- Sir.

177
00:17:59,525 --> 00:18:00,924
Lodge an FIR, make an inventory...

178
00:18:01,027 --> 00:18:02,551
...and report back here.
- Yes.

179
00:18:02,662 --> 00:18:04,220
Take Ranveer Singh's signature on the GMD...

180
00:18:04,297 --> 00:18:05,730
...you have only 30 minutes left.
- Yes, sir.

181
00:18:05,832 --> 00:18:07,163
Ranveer Singh.
- Sir.

182
00:18:07,267 --> 00:18:09,064
Inform your police station over the wireless...

183
00:18:09,135 --> 00:18:11,028
...that Joginder's arriving with all these valuables.

184
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:11,501
- Sir.

185
00:18:11,571 --> 00:18:12,731
You will wait here.

186
00:18:12,805 --> 00:18:14,500
Joginder will lodge an FIR and come back to you...

187
00:18:14,574 --> 00:18:16,276
...and take your signature on the GMD and...

188
00:18:16,277 --> 00:18:16,701
- GMD?

189
00:18:17,043 --> 00:18:18,169
What's wrong?

190
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:20,979
Sir, I...
- Sir?

191
00:18:21,447 --> 00:18:23,176
What's GMD?

192
00:18:23,683 --> 00:18:25,150
Is this your first raid?

193
00:18:25,218 --> 00:18:26,344
Yes, sir.

194
00:18:26,953 --> 00:18:28,079
How do you feel?

195
00:18:28,187 --> 00:18:29,184
Very good, sir.

196
00:18:29,185 --> 00:18:30,712
I've become your fan.

197
00:18:31,491 --> 00:18:34,289
First time I'm seeing the power of honesty.

198
00:18:34,594 --> 00:18:35,720
Such people should be...

199
00:18:35,828 --> 00:18:37,921
Always remember one thing Ranveer Singh.

200
00:18:38,631 --> 00:18:41,191
True power comes from the heart.

201
00:18:41,634 --> 00:18:43,659
Always remember this in life.

202
00:18:43,736 --> 00:18:44,634
Okay, sir.

203
00:18:45,104 --> 00:18:46,503
Sir, now we...
- Yes.

204
00:18:46,873 --> 00:18:48,540
Go and start the car.
Okay.

205
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:49,034
- Yes.

206
00:18:49,142 --> 00:18:49,588
Sir.

207
00:18:49,589 --> 00:18:50,515
- Good luck.

208
00:18:50,516 --> 00:18:51,472
Well done.

209
00:18:52,178 --> 00:18:54,078
Jai Hind.
- Jai Hind.

210
00:19:15,335 --> 00:19:16,893
You know what, sir.

211
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:18,860
Yes, Shanti.

212
00:19:19,339 --> 00:19:21,273
They're doing the real duty.

213
00:19:22,342 --> 00:19:24,173
We're just...

214
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:49,657
True power comes from the heart.

215
00:19:49,736 --> 00:19:50,703
What else could I do?

216
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:51,964
I didn't know what to do.

217
00:19:52,071 --> 00:19:54,096
That minister was still tailing me even after I slapped him twice.

218
00:19:54,173 --> 00:19:55,333
I was so scared.

219
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:56,965
The PA was fine, but then...

220
00:19:57,043 --> 00:19:58,203
And what was everyone up to?

221
00:19:58,311 --> 00:20:00,472
Iqbal was taking my pictures, without a reason.

222
00:20:00,546 --> 00:20:02,480
You wanted to lead.

223
00:20:02,582 --> 00:20:04,174
Go ahead and lead.

224
00:20:41,654 --> 00:20:43,246
Hurry up.

225
00:20:47,727 --> 00:20:49,354
Come on, come on.

226
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,499
Here you go.
- Yes, brother.

227
00:20:55,568 --> 00:20:57,934
Now leave.

228
00:21:36,075 --> 00:21:37,133
Airport.

229
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,051
Old Delhi Station.
- Sit.

230
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,795
Hey mister, will I get a bus to Jaipur from here?

231
00:22:02,869 --> 00:22:04,427
Yes.

232
00:22:20,853 --> 00:22:22,150
Here you go.

233
00:22:28,828 --> 00:22:30,728
One for Chandigarh.

234
00:23:39,832 --> 00:23:40,764
Say that again.

235
00:23:43,603 --> 00:23:44,934
Shanti, they...

236
00:23:45,004 --> 00:23:46,369
You know, sir.

237
00:23:46,439 --> 00:23:47,963
I knew something was wrong.

238
00:23:49,442 --> 00:23:51,205
Wait here.
- Yes.

239
00:24:00,086 --> 00:24:01,280
Mr. Minister.

240
00:24:06,192 --> 00:24:07,159
What's wrong?

241
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,557
I've been ruined.

242
00:24:08,628 --> 00:24:10,220
Why do you look so sad?

243
00:24:12,665 --> 00:24:16,157
We made a small mistake.

244
00:24:48,768 --> 00:24:51,066
Good morning, brother Joginder.
- Morning.

245
00:25:19,298 --> 00:25:20,322
Anything in the papers?

246
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:21,229
Nothing.

247
00:25:21,334 --> 00:25:24,235
Hindi, English, Punjabi, nothing in either of them.

248
00:25:25,004 --> 00:25:26,130
Sell everything.

249
00:25:26,205 --> 00:25:27,172
We'll meet at the marriage.

250
00:25:27,239 --> 00:25:28,297
Of course.

251
00:25:35,348 --> 00:25:37,043
Raise that higher.

252
00:25:37,116 --> 00:25:39,016
Just a minute.

253
00:25:41,921 --> 00:25:43,855
Anything in the news?
- No.

254
00:25:45,057 --> 00:25:46,581
How are the marriage preparations?

255
00:25:46,692 --> 00:25:48,023
I'm going crazy?

256
00:25:48,461 --> 00:25:50,361
My own marriage preparations were lot smoother...

257
00:25:50,496 --> 00:25:52,361
...then my daughter's.

258
00:25:52,598 --> 00:25:53,565
That's normal.

259
00:25:53,632 --> 00:25:55,793
The father's normally at his tethers on his daughter's marriage.

260
00:25:55,868 --> 00:25:57,267
That's fine.

261
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:58,359
When are you arriving?

262
00:25:58,437 --> 00:25:59,631
Friday.

263
00:25:59,972 --> 00:26:01,028
Come soon.

264
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:02,067
I feel alone.

265
00:26:02,575 --> 00:26:03,837
Do you need anything?

266
00:26:04,343 --> 00:26:05,776
No, just come here.

267
00:26:06,645 --> 00:26:08,943
Get me 7-8 cartons of imported cigarette.

268
00:26:09,048 --> 00:26:10,811
For the wedding guests.

269
00:26:11,117 --> 00:26:12,311
And wait a minute.

270
00:26:12,418 --> 00:26:13,578
What's written here?

271
00:26:13,819 --> 00:26:16,287
A nice watch for the groom.

272
00:26:16,355 --> 00:26:17,253
And?

273
00:26:17,323 --> 00:26:19,655
And a Philips VCR.

274
00:26:19,725 --> 00:26:21,784
And... what's a Chuser-grinder?

275
00:26:21,894 --> 00:26:23,486
I don't get it.

276
00:26:23,562 --> 00:26:27,362
A nice black pair of Bata shoes, without laces.

277
00:26:27,433 --> 00:26:28,923
Don't forget.

278
00:26:29,001 --> 00:26:31,265
Perfumes and scents.

279
00:26:31,871 --> 00:26:33,862
And you get anything else that you like.

280
00:26:34,507 --> 00:26:35,385
How about a car?

281
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:36,975
- No, I've booked one here.

282
00:26:37,276 --> 00:26:38,971
Inform me about your flight.

283
00:26:39,044 --> 00:26:40,511
I'll send someone to pick you up.

284
00:26:40,613 --> 00:26:42,274
You'll be carrying a lot of luggage.

285
00:26:42,815 --> 00:26:43,941
Fine.

286
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:45,774
See you.

287
00:26:46,252 --> 00:26:47,241
Come soon.

288
00:26:48,654 --> 00:26:49,552
Where are you going?

289
00:26:49,622 --> 00:26:51,647
Who will finish the work downstairs, lazy bums?

290
00:26:57,596 --> 00:26:59,291
Hello.
- It's your uncle.

291
00:26:59,365 --> 00:27:00,127
How are you, Rahul?

292
00:27:00,199 --> 00:27:00,909
I'm good.

293
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:01,762
How are you?

294
00:27:02,034 --> 00:27:02,500
I am fine.

295
00:27:02,501 --> 00:27:03,433
Where's your papa?

296
00:27:03,536 --> 00:27:04,750
He's washing the clothes.

297
00:27:04,751 --> 00:27:05,527
I'll call him.

298
00:27:09,442 --> 00:27:11,740
Papa.
Uncle Ajay's called.

299
00:27:12,278 --> 00:27:13,108
What did you say?

300
00:27:13,212 --> 00:27:14,804
I said you're washing clothes, what else?

301
00:27:23,088 --> 00:27:24,077
Hello.

302
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:26,588
Anything in the papers?
- No.

303
00:27:26,692 --> 00:27:27,852
Why were you washing clothes?

304
00:27:27,927 --> 00:27:29,121
Clothes?
No.

305
00:27:29,195 --> 00:27:31,026
My handkerchief was too dirty.

306
00:27:31,096 --> 00:27:32,620
Malti's gone to see the doctor.

307
00:27:32,731 --> 00:27:33,925
Look at that!

308
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:35,398
Wasting time on the phone.

309
00:27:35,468 --> 00:27:37,197
I asked you to make tea.

310
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,497
And, did you finish washing the clothes?

311
00:27:40,573 --> 00:27:41,870
It's a call from the head-office.

312
00:27:41,974 --> 00:27:44,169
Ask them to give you an increment.

313
00:27:44,243 --> 00:27:45,835
You can't even afford a servant now.

314
00:27:45,911 --> 00:27:48,311
I've to do all the chores at home.

315
00:27:51,116 --> 00:27:52,447
We'll meet at the marriage.

316
00:27:52,852 --> 00:27:54,319
Hello. Hello.
- Yes.

317
00:27:54,386 --> 00:27:57,685
Ajay.
Don't tell them about this.

318
00:27:57,756 --> 00:27:58,814
Why?

319
00:27:59,258 --> 00:28:00,691
They'll tease me to death.

320
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:01,987
I won't.

321
00:28:02,595 --> 00:28:03,721
See you.

322
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:26,976
Who are you?

323
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:31,278
How are we related?

324
00:28:32,758 --> 00:28:39,527
What's this bond that binds us?

325
00:28:41,033 --> 00:28:48,906
I can't control myself before you.

326
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:51,843
Who are you?

327
00:28:52,244 --> 00:28:56,772
How are we related?

328
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:24,865
Stupid girl.

329
00:29:24,866 --> 00:29:26,139
Can't you see?

330
00:29:30,316 --> 00:29:32,181
Grandma, I'm leaving.

331
00:29:33,018 --> 00:29:33,646
Say See you.

332
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:34,847
You're not running away, are you?

333
00:29:34,853 --> 00:29:42,487
Don't ever leave me and go away.

334
00:29:42,595 --> 00:29:46,895
For my sake.

335
00:29:47,132 --> 00:29:54,868
Always stay with, whether it's true of false.

336
00:29:55,574 --> 00:29:59,066
Orjust an illusion.

337
00:29:59,178 --> 00:30:07,608
I've tried my best to make you mine.

338
00:30:07,686 --> 00:30:15,889
Hold my hands so I can let everyone know.

339
00:30:16,362 --> 00:30:19,229
Who are you?

340
00:30:19,331 --> 00:30:23,427
How are we related?

341
00:30:29,408 --> 00:30:30,500
What is it?

342
00:30:32,244 --> 00:30:33,711
Wedding invitation.

343
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,974
She's getting married.

344
00:30:36,081 --> 00:30:37,173
To whom?

345
00:30:37,383 --> 00:30:38,543
Tukaram.

346
00:30:39,084 --> 00:30:40,517
Now?

347
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:41,774
What now?

348
00:30:41,775 --> 00:30:43,452
The groom will be ruined.

349
00:30:44,723 --> 00:30:46,452
Come on, clean the scooter.

350
00:30:46,525 --> 00:30:47,924
Come on, go.

351
00:30:52,598 --> 00:30:53,360
Sir, please.

352
00:30:53,432 --> 00:30:54,763
If you give me some more time...

353
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:57,028
...I will find out who they were.

354
00:30:57,603 --> 00:30:59,387
You don't want to file a complaint?

355
00:30:59,388 --> 00:30:59,833
- No.

356
00:31:00,305 --> 00:31:01,465
What about the investigation?

357
00:31:01,573 --> 00:31:02,067
Look, ACP.

358
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:03,598
I've already lost everything.

359
00:31:03,676 --> 00:31:05,143
Now this news shouldn't be leaked out to the press.

360
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,072
That's it.

361
00:31:06,178 --> 00:31:08,738
If you can still do anything, then go ahead.

362
00:31:08,847 --> 00:31:10,781
We cannot do anything without an FIR.

363
00:31:11,116 --> 00:31:13,482
You can suspend these officers.

364
00:31:13,552 --> 00:31:17,044
These two were helping those thieves the other day.

365
00:31:17,556 --> 00:31:19,888
Sir, let's stop arguing over those thieves.

366
00:31:20,259 --> 00:31:23,558
Let me tell you, we cannot do anything without an FIR.

367
00:31:27,132 --> 00:31:29,430
Why don't you understand?

368
00:31:30,002 --> 00:31:31,970
I've a public image.

369
00:31:32,071 --> 00:31:35,632
If they find out four people made a fool out of me...

370
00:31:36,075 --> 00:31:38,635
...it will be the end of my political career.

371
00:31:39,545 --> 00:31:42,070
No.
Let it go.

372
00:31:47,586 --> 00:31:49,383
Ranvir Singh.
- Sir.

373
00:31:51,056 --> 00:31:52,148
Shame on you.

374
00:31:52,624 --> 00:31:54,387
Will we help thieves and robbers now?

375
00:31:55,027 --> 00:31:55,959
You're absolutely right, sir.

376
00:31:56,061 --> 00:31:59,121
The Minister isn't filing a report, otherwise...

377
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,527
But, there will be a departmental inquiry.

378
00:32:04,803 --> 00:32:06,668
And, until the inquiry isn't over...

379
00:32:07,372 --> 00:32:10,273
...you and Shanti are suspended.

380
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,805
Got it.
- Sir.

381
00:32:17,516 --> 00:32:19,143
See you, sir.

382
00:32:21,353 --> 00:32:23,048
That was the right thing to do, sir.

383
00:32:23,155 --> 00:32:25,020
Suspending those two.

384
00:32:25,124 --> 00:32:26,591
Here, sir.

385
00:33:21,046 --> 00:33:22,479
Welcome, welcome.

386
00:33:22,815 --> 00:33:26,342
Lift this up.

387
00:33:26,451 --> 00:33:28,214
Come, brother.

388
00:33:31,156 --> 00:33:32,248
Brother, you're still here.

389
00:33:32,324 --> 00:33:33,757
Let's go.
Come on.

390
00:33:34,026 --> 00:33:35,118
That way.

391
00:33:39,231 --> 00:33:40,789
Come on.

392
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,231
Hail the Lord!

393
00:33:44,236 --> 00:33:45,863
Move aside.

394
00:33:45,971 --> 00:33:47,404
Let me sit.

395
00:33:48,273 --> 00:33:50,070
Come on.

396
00:34:06,959 --> 00:34:08,620
You're here.

397
00:34:08,694 --> 00:34:10,161
How are you, Sharma?

398
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:12,194
Bless you.

399
00:34:12,297 --> 00:34:13,389
Congratulations.

400
00:34:13,498 --> 00:34:14,123
Did you get the things?

401
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:14,790
Hello, son.

402
00:34:14,867 --> 00:34:15,856
Get the things.

403
00:34:15,968 --> 00:34:16,732
Yes, the luggage's right there.

404
00:34:16,733 --> 00:34:17,162
Take all of them.

405
00:34:17,236 --> 00:34:17,827
Come.

406
00:34:17,936 --> 00:34:18,738
Are the others here?

407
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:19,460
- Yes, they are.

408
00:34:19,571 --> 00:34:20,445
They arrived in the morning.

409
00:34:20,446 --> 00:34:21,038
- Where are they?

410
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:21,901
They're inside.

411
00:34:22,007 --> 00:34:23,565
They must be eating.

412
00:34:23,675 --> 00:34:24,332
Let them eat.

413
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:26,200
- This is the time for them to eat.

414
00:34:26,311 --> 00:34:28,142
Don't taunt them.

415
00:34:28,213 --> 00:34:30,909
He's here.

416
00:34:31,016 --> 00:34:32,262
Go ahead, eat.

417
00:34:32,263 --> 00:34:34,042
- Congratulations.

418
00:34:34,953 --> 00:34:36,045
Come on.

419
00:34:36,154 --> 00:34:37,849
You didn't eat anything.

420
00:34:38,357 --> 00:34:39,217
You're looking really smart.

421
00:34:39,218 --> 00:34:39,984
- Where are the others?

422
00:34:40,058 --> 00:34:41,821
I'll introduce you to my kids.

423
00:34:42,361 --> 00:34:44,056
This is Sukhwinder.
- Hello.

424
00:34:44,129 --> 00:34:45,027
This is Parminder.
- Hello.

425
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:46,119
This is Maninder.
- Hello.

426
00:34:46,198 --> 00:34:47,028
This is Jitender.
- Hello.

427
00:34:47,132 --> 00:34:48,429
This is Harminder.
- Hello.

428
00:34:48,533 --> 00:34:49,557
This is Dharmender.
- Hello.

429
00:34:49,635 --> 00:34:50,863
She's getting married, Tinky.
- Hello.

430
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:52,561
And she's Mrs. Sharma.
- Hello.

431
00:34:52,638 --> 00:34:54,663
And this is Ajay, lqbal, Joginder.

432
00:34:54,773 --> 00:34:55,899
And she's newly born.

433
00:34:56,008 --> 00:34:57,407
We haven't given her a name yet.

434
00:34:57,476 --> 00:34:58,408
That's it.

435
00:34:59,845 --> 00:35:01,938
We didn't have television.

436
00:35:02,047 --> 00:35:03,014
Surprising.

437
00:35:03,081 --> 00:35:04,605
Take a picture.

438
00:35:10,656 --> 00:35:13,682
Hurry up, or else...

439
00:35:15,661 --> 00:35:18,653
The moon will rise up.

440
00:35:20,666 --> 00:35:23,658
The tent will be...

441
00:35:25,704 --> 00:35:28,673
Filled with fog.

442
00:35:31,076 --> 00:35:36,013
I want to bathe in your colour.

443
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:02,329
You are so beautiful.

444
00:36:02,441 --> 00:36:04,705
You look priceless.

445
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:07,276
Every time I look at you.

446
00:36:07,379 --> 00:36:09,813
My heart skips a beat.

447
00:36:10,215 --> 00:36:11,477
Your face...

448
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,744
Your face...

449
00:36:12,851 --> 00:36:15,342
Your face covered with tresses.

450
00:36:15,454 --> 00:36:18,252
It's so awesome, girl.

451
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:27,798
Your face covered with tresses.

452
00:36:27,899 --> 00:36:30,732
It's so awesome, girl.

453
00:36:42,381 --> 00:36:45,214
My friends say.

454
00:36:47,386 --> 00:36:50,321
Boys are such a flirt.

455
00:36:52,491 --> 00:36:54,925
My friends say.

456
00:36:54,993 --> 00:36:57,325
Boys are such a flirt.

457
00:36:57,396 --> 00:36:59,990
They always sweet-talk girls.

458
00:37:00,098 --> 00:37:02,157
Beloved.

459
00:37:02,234 --> 00:37:04,930
If you're one of them.

460
00:37:05,037 --> 00:37:07,505
If you break my heart.

461
00:37:07,606 --> 00:37:10,074
Then what about me?

462
00:37:10,175 --> 00:37:12,643
Beloved.

463
00:37:13,211 --> 00:37:15,475
I'm no betrayer, test me all you want.

464
00:37:15,547 --> 00:37:17,777
Just spend a night with me.

465
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:20,243
I will never leave you, I swear.

466
00:37:20,352 --> 00:37:22,377
I will love you all my life.

467
00:37:22,454 --> 00:37:24,615
I am the shadow, you are the sun, beloved.

468
00:37:24,956 --> 00:37:27,015
You are priceless, beloved.

469
00:37:27,392 --> 00:37:29,758
Every time I look at you.

470
00:37:29,828 --> 00:37:32,296
My heart skips a beat.

471
00:37:32,731 --> 00:37:33,993
Your face...

472
00:37:34,099 --> 00:37:35,259
Your face...

473
00:37:35,367 --> 00:37:37,858
Your face covered with tresses.

474
00:37:37,936 --> 00:37:40,803
It's so awesome, girl.

475
00:37:49,915 --> 00:37:52,884
The game of love.

476
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,889
Is a deceitful one.

477
00:37:59,925 --> 00:38:02,325
The game of love.

478
00:38:02,394 --> 00:38:04,885
Is a deceitful one.

479
00:38:04,963 --> 00:38:07,557
Your freedoms always at stake.

480
00:38:07,632 --> 00:38:09,793
Beloved.

481
00:38:09,868 --> 00:38:12,336
Once you fall in love.

482
00:38:12,437 --> 00:38:14,871
You can't get out of it.

483
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,602
I don't want fall in love ever.

484
00:38:17,676 --> 00:38:20,509
Beloved.

485
00:38:20,612 --> 00:38:23,080
Love me, trust me just once.

486
00:38:23,181 --> 00:38:25,274
I will always be with you.

487
00:38:25,684 --> 00:38:26,810
If you give me your heart...

488
00:38:26,885 --> 00:38:29,786
...I will give you everything, that's my promise.

489
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:32,118
We're made for each other.

490
00:38:32,424 --> 00:38:34,654
You are precious, beloved.

491
00:38:34,826 --> 00:38:37,226
Every time I look at you.

492
00:38:37,329 --> 00:38:39,797
My heart skips a beat.

493
00:38:40,365 --> 00:38:41,457
Your face...

494
00:38:41,566 --> 00:38:42,760
Your face...

495
00:38:42,834 --> 00:38:45,359
Your face covered with tresses.

496
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:48,701
It's so awesome, girl.

497
00:39:18,136 --> 00:39:19,694
You did the right thing by attending the marriage.

498
00:39:19,871 --> 00:39:21,133
We had such fun.

499
00:39:21,273 --> 00:39:22,740
How can I not come if you call?

500
00:39:24,609 --> 00:39:25,735
Jai Hind, sir.

501
00:39:26,411 --> 00:39:27,571
Jai Hind.

502
00:39:27,712 --> 00:39:28,804
Anything else, Mr. Khurana?

503
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,972
You can leave, I'll talk to you later.

504
00:39:29,973 --> 00:39:30,245
- Yes.

505
00:39:31,917 --> 00:39:33,009
Mr. Khurana?

506
00:39:33,118 --> 00:39:33,523
Yes.

507
00:39:33,524 --> 00:39:35,143
They think I'm the IG of police.

508
00:39:37,055 --> 00:39:37,986
Think big.

509
00:39:37,987 --> 00:39:39,717
The children have grown up.

510
00:39:40,358 --> 00:39:41,183
It's not like before.

511
00:39:41,184 --> 00:39:42,087
It's getting scarier.

512
00:39:42,761 --> 00:39:44,160
Last night I had a dream, that...

513
00:39:44,229 --> 00:39:46,060
...my son-in-law's come to see me in jail.

514
00:39:46,264 --> 00:39:47,731
And you were nowhere to be seen.

515
00:39:47,832 --> 00:39:48,924
You didn't look properly.

516
00:39:49,034 --> 00:39:50,729
I must be standing right behind you.

517
00:39:52,204 --> 00:39:53,364
Where's the next one?

518
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:55,233
Kolkata.

519
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,966
Where in Kolkata?

520
00:39:57,175 --> 00:39:58,233
Bada Bazaar.

521
00:39:58,510 --> 00:39:59,602
Is it good?

522
00:40:00,712 --> 00:40:01,804
When?

523
00:40:02,113 --> 00:40:03,205
A week later.

524
00:40:03,281 --> 00:40:04,942
Big or small.
- Small.

525
00:40:06,318 --> 00:40:07,546
Think something big.

526
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:08,745
We'll need more people do something big...

527
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,481
...and that means more money.

528
00:40:10,589 --> 00:40:12,955
Had I been doing ajob, then I would've retired at this age.

529
00:40:13,091 --> 00:40:14,991
You've been saying that for the last 5 years.

530
00:40:15,093 --> 00:40:16,424
No, I'm serious now.

531
00:40:16,494 --> 00:40:18,189
You've been saying that for the past 3 years.

532
00:40:19,864 --> 00:40:20,956
Here you go.

533
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:22,496
The tickets and money are in this.

534
00:40:22,567 --> 00:40:24,501
You Joginder and lqbal will meet me directly.

535
00:40:24,569 --> 00:40:25,866
Okay?
- Okay.

536
00:40:25,971 --> 00:40:27,029
See you.

537
00:40:27,706 --> 00:40:29,037
Take care.
- Yes.

538
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:47,883
Run, run, run, run, run.

539
00:41:04,976 --> 00:41:06,671
Stop, stop, stop.

540
00:41:06,745 --> 00:41:08,110
Stop.

541
00:41:08,446 --> 00:41:10,175
Sorry.
- Come on.

542
00:41:10,248 --> 00:41:12,409
Hi, Aman.
- Hi.

543
00:41:12,684 --> 00:41:13,946
Come on.

544
00:41:14,052 --> 00:41:15,280
Let's go.
- Bye.

545
00:41:15,387 --> 00:41:16,718
Bye, dad.
- Bye.

546
00:41:16,821 --> 00:41:18,236
Father.
Call me father.

547
00:41:18,237 --> 00:41:19,221
- Bye, father.

548
00:41:29,501 --> 00:41:30,552
We were about to miss the bus.

549
00:41:30,553 --> 00:41:31,162
- Rahul's called.

550
00:41:37,242 --> 00:41:38,504
Where's your veil?

551
00:41:41,846 --> 00:41:43,006
Yes, Rahul.

552
00:41:44,049 --> 00:41:45,175
Where?

553
00:41:46,217 --> 00:41:47,343
I'll be right there.

554
00:41:49,154 --> 00:41:50,036
Something urgent has come up.

555
00:41:50,037 --> 00:41:50,644
I'll be back soon.

556
00:41:51,323 --> 00:41:52,551
Will you go like this?

557
00:41:53,291 --> 00:41:54,622
Yes, it's okay.

558
00:42:53,752 --> 00:42:54,912
Morning, sir.

559
00:42:55,387 --> 00:42:56,251
Are you sure it's him?

560
00:42:56,252 --> 00:42:56,698
- Yes, sir.

561
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:57,548
He'll be here soon.

562
00:42:57,655 --> 00:42:58,683
Who will identify him?

563
00:42:58,684 --> 00:42:59,384
- Munna, sir.

564
00:43:06,598 --> 00:43:07,602
Don't beat me.

565
00:43:07,603 --> 00:43:09,109
Don't beat me, sir.

566
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:10,329
- No.
Let me go.

567
00:43:10,402 --> 00:43:11,153
I've children.

568
00:43:11,154 --> 00:43:13,030
- Shut up or we'll beat you more.

569
00:43:13,138 --> 00:43:13,937
Leave me.

570
00:43:13,938 --> 00:43:15,003
Let me go.

571
00:43:17,809 --> 00:43:19,037
Why did you beat him so much?

572
00:43:19,177 --> 00:43:21,170
They were gentle compared to you, Waseem sir.

573
00:43:21,171 --> 00:43:21,668
- Move.

574
00:43:24,482 --> 00:43:25,744
Sir. Gupta.

575
00:43:33,958 --> 00:43:34,872
Is that him?

576
00:43:34,873 --> 00:43:35,482
- Yes.

577
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:36,049
Rascal.

578
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:36,715
Come here.

579
00:43:36,716 --> 00:43:37,594
Identify him.

580
00:43:39,631 --> 00:43:41,292
Yes, that's him.

581
00:43:42,267 --> 00:43:42,499
Go.

582
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,427
- Sir.
- Come on.

583
00:44:00,785 --> 00:44:01,183
Hey.

584
00:44:01,184 --> 00:44:02,776
Hey, Gupta.
Stop.

585
00:44:02,921 --> 00:44:04,047
Come here.

586
00:44:06,658 --> 00:44:08,216
Stop.

587
00:44:08,293 --> 00:44:09,131
Where are you going?

588
00:44:09,132 --> 00:44:09,760
Stop the car.

589
00:44:12,397 --> 00:44:13,523
Stop.

590
00:44:19,737 --> 00:44:20,863
Stop.

591
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:35,711
Stop.

592
00:45:16,361 --> 00:45:17,521
Stop.

593
00:45:25,637 --> 00:45:26,763
Hey, move.

594
00:45:29,974 --> 00:45:31,100
You...

595
00:45:34,112 --> 00:45:35,272
Stop. Stop.

596
00:45:42,153 --> 00:45:43,279
Stop.

597
00:45:46,991 --> 00:45:48,288
Hey, what is it?

598
00:45:48,359 --> 00:45:50,384
CBI.
Follow that rickshaw.

599
00:45:57,402 --> 00:45:58,528
Closer.

600
00:45:59,504 --> 00:46:01,369
Run. You...

601
00:46:06,377 --> 00:46:07,605
Do you want to die?

602
00:46:52,724 --> 00:46:54,282
Don't come any closer.

603
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:00,158
I will jump down.

604
00:47:02,567 --> 00:47:03,795
Don't come any closer.

605
00:47:03,868 --> 00:47:04,381
Stay there.

606
00:47:04,382 --> 00:47:05,267
I will jump down.

607
00:47:07,505 --> 00:47:08,631
Stay there.

608
00:47:10,808 --> 00:47:12,105
I say stop.

609
00:47:27,592 --> 00:47:29,856
Sir.
He's doing the real job.

610
00:47:30,928 --> 00:47:32,657
We're just.

611
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,033
Step aside.
Move.

612
00:47:37,135 --> 00:47:38,329
Come, sir.

613
00:47:51,783 --> 00:47:52,880
Good morning, teacher.

614
00:47:52,881 --> 00:47:53,478
- Morning.

615
00:48:00,758 --> 00:48:01,918
How are you?

616
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:03,518
Don't you dare talk to me.

617
00:48:03,628 --> 00:48:04,822
Where were you?

618
00:48:05,363 --> 00:48:06,591
Chandigarh.

619
00:48:07,432 --> 00:48:09,059
My friend's daughter was getting married.

620
00:48:10,201 --> 00:48:12,726
I tried to meet you the other day, but the old man...

621
00:48:12,837 --> 00:48:14,498
Father.
- Yes, him.

622
00:48:15,473 --> 00:48:17,498
I tried calling you all evening...

623
00:48:17,575 --> 00:48:19,042
...but he answered the call every time.

624
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:20,338
Did you see the card?

625
00:48:21,245 --> 00:48:22,439
How was it?

626
00:48:24,482 --> 00:48:26,950
Why are you wasting your father's provident fund?

627
00:48:27,585 --> 00:48:29,109
Grandma really likes the boy.

628
00:48:30,188 --> 00:48:31,587
You look happy.

629
00:48:32,657 --> 00:48:34,818
Do you like that Tukaram as well?

630
00:48:35,626 --> 00:48:37,287
I'm happy because I know...

631
00:48:37,361 --> 00:48:39,454
...you won't let me marry that Tukaram.

632
00:48:40,031 --> 00:48:41,498
By the way, what are you waiting for?

633
00:48:42,033 --> 00:48:43,466
For a big tender.

634
00:48:44,235 --> 00:48:46,100
You call your scams and thefts tender.

635
00:48:46,738 --> 00:48:48,205
I still have some shame left in me.

636
00:48:48,706 --> 00:48:50,401
Then why do such things in the first place?

637
00:48:51,042 --> 00:48:52,441
Because that's the only thing I know.

638
00:48:53,745 --> 00:48:55,007
People are restless...

639
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:56,478
...and my mind is restless.

640
00:48:57,548 --> 00:49:00,676
Whenever I look at you...

641
00:49:01,953 --> 00:49:03,716
I feel like being good.

642
00:49:10,528 --> 00:49:12,155
Is that why you keep running away from me?

643
00:49:13,931 --> 00:49:17,025
I try, but I can't.

644
00:49:19,704 --> 00:49:21,194
The marriage is next week, Ajay.

645
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:23,334
I know.

646
00:49:24,542 --> 00:49:25,873
What if you're caught?

647
00:49:30,715 --> 00:49:33,309
There's no one in this world who can catch me.

648
00:49:38,089 --> 00:49:39,522
Jai Hind, sir.
- Jai Hind.

649
00:49:41,459 --> 00:49:42,171
And look, sir.

650
00:49:42,172 --> 00:49:43,290
- Good morning, sir.

651
00:49:43,561 --> 00:49:44,755
A similar case took place in Kanpur.

652
00:49:44,829 --> 00:49:45,382
A year ago.

653
00:49:45,383 --> 00:49:46,387
- I see.
This one.

654
00:49:47,498 --> 00:49:49,022
Good morning, sir.

655
00:49:53,337 --> 00:49:54,395
Sir.

656
00:49:54,505 --> 00:49:55,699
Jai Hind.
- Jai Hind.

657
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,478
Did you hear about the 26th January case?

658
00:49:57,479 --> 00:49:57,837
- Yes.

659
00:49:57,975 --> 00:50:00,170
Four people conducted a raid posing
as officers of our department.

660
00:50:00,478 --> 00:50:02,673
The minister isn't filing a case for obvious reasons.

661
00:50:02,747 --> 00:50:05,113
For reasons best known to him.
- Yes.

662
00:50:05,216 --> 00:50:06,547
The minister isn't filing a case...

663
00:50:06,651 --> 00:50:08,175
...for reasons best known to him.

664
00:50:08,786 --> 00:50:10,151
It's a simple police case, sir.

665
00:50:10,254 --> 00:50:11,499
You do know that they...

666
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,484
- But still, sir.

667
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:14,385
Why indulge in such petty...

668
00:50:14,725 --> 00:50:15,953
Do you see that man?

669
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,760
He's the SI who helped them conduct the rain.

670
00:50:18,863 --> 00:50:20,228
Poor guy, he was humiliated.

671
00:50:21,165 --> 00:50:22,996
He conducted an investigation...

672
00:50:23,901 --> 00:50:25,698
...and gathered this information.

673
00:50:26,671 --> 00:50:28,935
There have been 13 such cases in the last 2 years.

674
00:50:29,407 --> 00:50:30,738
These are the ones that were detected.

675
00:50:30,842 --> 00:50:32,537
No one knows the real number of cases.

676
00:50:33,277 --> 00:50:36,508
Fake CBI, Income Tax or ACB teams conduct a raid...

677
00:50:36,581 --> 00:50:38,913
...and the victims never report.

678
00:50:39,283 --> 00:50:40,750
Rumours are spreading.

679
00:50:41,786 --> 00:50:44,880
There's a theory that they're ex-CBI.

680
00:50:45,323 --> 00:50:46,483
Strange.

681
00:50:47,458 --> 00:50:49,426
Anyway, we've to stop this nonsense.

682
00:50:50,328 --> 00:50:51,693
They're slandering our name.

683
00:50:51,896 --> 00:50:56,697
Madras(Chennai), Nagpur, Trivandrum. Lucknow.

684
00:50:56,801 --> 00:50:58,132
Sir, it's all over the country.

685
00:50:58,202 --> 00:51:01,330
They mostly target businessmen and politicians.

686
00:51:01,439 --> 00:51:02,838
Because there's black money involved...

687
00:51:02,907 --> 00:51:04,499
...no one wants to report it.

688
00:51:04,942 --> 00:51:06,933
Which party do these politicians belong to, sir?

689
00:51:07,111 --> 00:51:09,170
They're from every party we know.

690
00:51:09,714 --> 00:51:11,978
I expect you to end this nuisance immediately.

691
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:13,476
Yes, sir.

692
00:51:13,684 --> 00:51:16,380
Sir, I haven't received a promotion and increment yet.

693
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,748
It's getting difficult to run the household.

694
00:51:17,822 --> 00:51:19,057
Shall I start accepting bribes?

695
00:51:19,058 --> 00:51:19,983
- Threatening me again.

696
00:51:20,358 --> 00:51:21,484
I'm discussing this matter.

697
00:51:21,592 --> 00:51:22,786
Consider it done from my side.

698
00:51:24,161 --> 00:51:24,886
Jai Hind, sir.

699
00:51:24,887 --> 00:51:25,560
- Jai Hind.

700
00:51:28,966 --> 00:51:30,524
And in that case all the four officers...

701
00:51:30,635 --> 00:51:32,432
...they posed as income tax officers.

702
00:51:32,433 --> 00:51:33,331
- Here, take this.

703
00:51:33,404 --> 00:51:34,223
Good morning, sir.

704
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:34,996
- Good morning.

705
00:51:36,641 --> 00:51:37,801
He's Waseem sir.

706
00:51:37,909 --> 00:51:39,342
He will be handling the case.

707
00:51:39,844 --> 00:51:41,505
SI Ranveer Singh.
Jai Hind.

708
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,444
Why is he standing?

709
00:51:43,445 --> 00:51:44,154
Let him sit.

710
00:51:44,155 --> 00:51:44,573
- Sit.

711
00:51:44,682 --> 00:51:45,232
No, I'm fine.

712
00:51:45,233 --> 00:51:45,740
- No, sit.

713
00:51:45,816 --> 00:51:46,328
No, I...

714
00:51:46,329 --> 00:51:47,545
- Please. Please.

715
00:51:47,618 --> 00:51:48,778
Sit.
- Sit.

716
00:51:48,886 --> 00:51:50,012
Sit.

717
00:52:04,302 --> 00:52:06,497
They made a fool of you, Mr. Ranveer.

718
00:52:09,206 --> 00:52:10,332
Yes.

719
00:52:11,776 --> 00:52:13,573
Will you tell me what exactly happened?

720
00:52:16,614 --> 00:52:18,047
It was the 26th of January.

721
00:52:18,683 --> 00:52:19,843
I was on duty.

722
00:52:20,484 --> 00:52:21,610
I received a call.

723
00:52:28,426 --> 00:52:29,791
'Tughlak Road police station, hello.'

724
00:52:30,161 --> 00:52:31,287
'Jai Hind.'

725
00:52:31,963 --> 00:52:32,591
'Jai Hind.

726
00:52:32,592 --> 00:52:33,658
- Who's this? '

727
00:52:34,498 --> 00:52:35,590
'SI Ranveer Singh.'

728
00:52:35,666 --> 00:52:37,395
'This is Ajay Singh from CBI ward 16.'

729
00:52:37,501 --> 00:52:39,469
'From additional director PK Sharma's office.'

730
00:52:39,603 --> 00:52:41,073
'Who is the officer on duty?

731
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:42,071
- That's me, sir.

732
00:52:42,273 --> 00:52:44,241
We need some men, to conduct a raid.'

733
00:52:44,675 --> 00:52:45,835
'How many, sir? '

734
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:48,576
'Four junior constables, and one lady constable along with
you.'

735
00:52:48,679 --> 00:52:49,841
'That will be enough.

736
00:52:49,842 --> 00:52:51,113
- Where's the raid? '

737
00:52:51,315 --> 00:52:53,215
'Even we don't know that.'

738
00:52:53,284 --> 00:52:54,546
'Only Mr. Sharma knows.'

739
00:52:54,618 --> 00:52:56,085
'Meet us at Safdurjung in 15 minutes.'

740
00:52:56,153 --> 00:52:57,586
'Jai Hind.
- Jai Hind.'

741
00:53:00,391 --> 00:53:02,256
Four of them.
- Yes, sir.

742
00:53:03,194 --> 00:53:04,354
Then?

743
00:53:05,196 --> 00:53:06,356
Then...

744
00:53:12,169 --> 00:53:14,000
'You just can't barge in here... '

745
00:53:15,306 --> 00:53:16,568
'Keep the phone down.'

746
00:53:25,983 --> 00:53:27,416
'Believe me, there's nothing in here.'

747
00:53:27,485 --> 00:53:28,713
'Madam, please step aside.'

748
00:53:28,786 --> 00:53:29,917
'Guddu's papa, stop them.

749
00:53:29,918 --> 00:53:30,777
- Let go of him.'

750
00:53:39,663 --> 00:53:43,963
Ranveer Singh, did someone tell you or did you...

751
00:53:45,236 --> 00:53:46,464
If you had been in my place then...

752
00:53:46,537 --> 00:53:49,563
If I had been in your place this
situation would've never come up.

753
00:53:50,608 --> 00:53:53,270
I didn't join the CBI to screw up!

754
00:53:57,915 --> 00:54:00,213
I admit my mistake, Waseem sir.

755
00:54:01,285 --> 00:54:02,946
I don't have to listen to your taunts.

756
00:54:03,654 --> 00:54:05,554
I came here because I needed your help.

757
00:54:05,956 --> 00:54:08,220
If you help me we can solve this case quickly.

758
00:54:08,926 --> 00:54:11,394
Otherwise, don't be mistaken that I've admitted defeat.

759
00:54:12,129 --> 00:54:13,960
It will take me longer alone...

760
00:54:14,999 --> 00:54:18,230
...but, I won't rest until I don't put an end to this.

761
00:54:25,509 --> 00:54:26,840
That's what I wanted to hear.

762
00:54:28,212 --> 00:54:29,557
Co-ordinate with all the police stations.

763
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:29,941
- Yes, sir.

764
00:54:30,047 --> 00:54:31,844
And Ranveer, you will check all the police records yourself...

765
00:54:31,916 --> 00:54:34,237
...because you're the only one who have seen them.

766
00:54:34,238 --> 00:54:34,817
- Sir.

767
00:54:35,086 --> 00:54:37,418
Let's hope we find their police records.

768
00:54:37,688 --> 00:54:39,121
When can we meet the minister?

769
00:54:42,526 --> 00:54:43,993
Yes.
What is it?

770
00:54:44,428 --> 00:54:45,520
Sir, this is Waseem Khan.

771
00:54:45,629 --> 00:54:46,721
From CBI.

772
00:54:46,931 --> 00:54:48,023
Again?

773
00:54:48,532 --> 00:54:49,658
He's the real one.

774
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:52,261
Hello.

775
00:55:26,904 --> 00:55:28,030
Taxi.

776
00:55:28,672 --> 00:55:29,832
Bada Bazaar.

777
00:56:49,853 --> 00:56:51,252
Joginder.
- Sir.

778
00:57:30,494 --> 00:57:31,620
Ajay.

779
00:57:39,203 --> 00:57:40,864
Don't waste my time.

780
00:57:41,171 --> 00:57:42,502
Otherwise I'll note this down.

781
00:57:42,573 --> 00:57:43,972
Note this down.
- Yes, sir.

782
00:58:08,299 --> 00:58:08,597
You?

783
00:58:08,598 --> 00:58:09,789
- CBI.
And you?

784
00:58:09,867 --> 00:58:10,376
What...

785
00:58:10,377 --> 00:58:12,267
- Income Tax Department.

786
00:58:12,703 --> 00:58:14,295
Mr. Sharma, give me the papers.

787
00:58:14,672 --> 00:58:16,731
Mr. Sharma, the order papers. Quick.

788
00:58:20,744 --> 00:58:21,700
Aggarwal Traders?

789
00:58:21,701 --> 00:58:22,769
- Poddar Traders.

790
00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:29,475
124?
- 214!

791
00:58:31,455 --> 00:58:32,547
What's this?

792
00:58:32,756 --> 00:58:34,018
Why do you mess up?

793
00:58:34,224 --> 00:58:36,124
Can't you see the numbers properly?

794
00:58:36,193 --> 00:58:38,161
You'll make me lose my job.

795
00:58:38,462 --> 00:58:39,690
You've grown old.

796
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:41,256
We were supposed to go to 124...

797
00:58:41,332 --> 00:58:42,424
...instead you brought us to 214.

798
00:58:42,533 --> 00:58:44,057
See?
- Sorry, sir.

799
00:58:44,601 --> 00:58:45,727
Sorry!

800
00:58:46,103 --> 00:58:48,264
It's time for you to retire.
- Yes.

801
00:58:49,206 --> 00:58:50,946
It happens sometimes.

802
00:58:50,947 --> 00:58:52,355
Things mess up.

803
00:58:52,356 --> 00:58:53,142
It's ok.

804
00:58:53,243 --> 00:58:54,972
Sorry, it was a slight blunder.

805
00:58:55,412 --> 00:58:56,640
You can continue.

806
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,643
You can get on with your job, and we'll get back to ours.

807
00:58:59,083 --> 00:59:00,345
Let's go.
- Yes.

808
00:59:14,365 --> 00:59:15,525
Aggarwal Traders.

809
00:59:15,632 --> 00:59:17,463
We're from the Income Tax.

810
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:21,637
No calls allowed. None.

811
00:59:21,705 --> 00:59:22,831
Sir...
- Quiet.

812
00:59:22,906 --> 00:59:23,535
Sir, there's nothing.

813
00:59:23,536 --> 00:59:24,134
- Where's the key?

814
00:59:24,208 --> 00:59:24,708
Where's the key?

815
00:59:24,709 --> 00:59:25,334
- Sir...
- Get it.

816
00:59:25,409 --> 00:59:26,842
Sir, the accounts...

817
00:59:38,555 --> 00:59:39,715
Sir, what have you done?

818
00:59:40,057 --> 00:59:41,615
I told you won't find anything.

819
00:59:41,616 --> 00:59:42,150
- Shut up.

820
00:59:44,361 --> 00:59:45,160
Come on.

821
00:59:45,161 --> 00:59:46,659
- Sir, sir...

822
00:59:54,104 --> 00:59:56,265
You're tearing the mattress.

- Sir...

844
01:00:17,394 --> 01:00:18,952
Where is it?
- Sir, please.

845
01:00:19,029 --> 01:00:20,963
Where's the money?
- Lqbal.

846
01:00:21,031 --> 01:00:22,191
Where's the cash...

847
01:00:25,502 --> 01:00:26,785
Move this mattress.

848
01:00:26,786 --> 01:00:27,527
Hurry up.

849
01:00:27,638 --> 01:00:29,538
Move back.
Hold me.

850
01:00:43,954 --> 01:00:45,751
What's going on?

851
01:00:45,823 --> 01:00:46,875
Clear them out.

852
01:00:46,876 --> 01:00:48,348
Clear all them out.

853
01:00:48,459 --> 01:00:49,824
What's going on here?

854
01:01:59,997 --> 01:02:01,259
Sign here.
- Sir, sir please.

855
01:02:01,331 --> 01:02:02,889
Sir, can't we reach some compromise.

856
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:03,511
Sir, please.

857
01:02:03,512 --> 01:02:04,490
- Shall I arrest you?

858
01:02:17,347 --> 01:02:18,814
How will get out of here?

859
01:02:19,483 --> 01:02:21,542
Why don't you understand?

860
01:02:22,352 --> 01:02:22,981
Not these.

861
01:02:22,982 --> 01:02:25,498
I'm talking about the ones in the vault.

862
01:02:25,499 --> 01:02:26,345
- Right, sir.

863
01:02:28,125 --> 01:02:30,423
I know.
I've seen these.

864
01:02:30,494 --> 01:02:31,791
Brother.
- Yes.

865
01:02:32,062 --> 01:02:33,290
I need a little help.

866
01:02:34,731 --> 01:02:35,229
Brother.

867
01:02:35,230 --> 01:02:36,368
- No, no.
It's okay.

868
01:02:36,369 --> 01:02:37,222
It's my duty.

869
01:02:37,334 --> 01:02:38,210
Thank you very much.

870
01:02:38,211 --> 01:02:38,824
- Thank you.

871
01:04:14,131 --> 01:04:15,257
Hello.

872
01:04:15,966 --> 01:04:17,126
Yes.

873
01:04:18,068 --> 01:04:19,041
Yes, Mr. Banerjee.

874
01:04:19,042 --> 01:04:19,797
How are you?

875
01:04:22,072 --> 01:04:23,266
When?

876
01:04:24,441 --> 01:04:25,601
Where?

877
01:04:28,845 --> 01:04:30,005
How many people?

878
01:04:31,381 --> 01:04:32,541
FIR?

879
01:04:33,617 --> 01:04:34,163
No, Mr. Banerjee.

880
01:04:34,164 --> 01:04:35,414
Whether anyone reports this or not...

881
01:04:35,485 --> 01:04:37,146
...I want this news to be reported.

882
01:04:38,288 --> 01:04:40,586
This has to get printed in tomorrow's newspapers.

883
01:04:40,891 --> 01:04:42,085
I don't care.

884
01:04:42,526 --> 01:04:44,187
It has to be printed big and bold.

885
01:04:44,294 --> 01:04:45,352
Alright?
Thank you.

886
01:04:45,462 --> 01:04:46,554
Goodnight.

887
01:04:58,375 --> 01:05:00,138
Find anything?
- Nothing, sir.

888
01:05:01,378 --> 01:05:02,743
Kolkata, Bada Bazaar.

889
01:05:03,046 --> 01:05:05,844
A fake income tax team of four conducted a raid.

890
01:05:06,683 --> 01:05:08,548
No business man wants to report this.

891
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:11,915
But it will still be in tomorrow's newspapers.

892
01:05:13,757 --> 01:05:15,782
Let's make these rascals nervous.

893
01:05:38,014 --> 01:05:39,140
Congratulations.

894
01:05:46,757 --> 01:05:49,021
Bogus Income Tax...

895
01:05:51,461 --> 01:05:53,725
Four people came dressed...

896
01:05:53,797 --> 01:05:54,991
Ajay.

897
01:06:05,375 --> 01:06:06,569
Sir.
- Sir.

898
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:08,370
Sir.

899
01:06:08,745 --> 01:06:09,871
Sir.

900
01:06:11,214 --> 01:06:12,374
Found him.

901
01:06:22,025 --> 01:06:23,754
Are you sure?
- 100%.

902
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:25,825
He said his name was P.K. Sharma...

903
01:06:26,163 --> 01:06:28,063
...and I can never forget one thing.

904
01:06:28,298 --> 01:06:30,323
'AIways remember, Ranveer Singh.'

905
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,027
'Real power comes from the heart.'

906
01:06:33,069 --> 01:06:36,266
'Always listen to your heart.'

907
01:06:36,373 --> 01:06:38,068
It's definitely him, sir.

908
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:41,502
They've published about us.

909
01:06:41,578 --> 01:06:43,705
It's clearly written here Four people posed as...

910
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:45,042
Ajay, what now?

911
01:06:45,882 --> 01:06:47,372
Mr. Sharma, you always said...

912
01:06:47,450 --> 01:06:49,714
...Let's do something big, and then retire.

913
01:06:50,987 --> 01:06:52,511
Do you have something in mind?

914
01:06:52,823 --> 01:06:54,791
Where?
- Mumbai.

915
01:06:55,325 --> 01:06:56,485
Is it worth it?

916
01:06:56,593 --> 01:06:58,458
You'll have to work harder.

917
01:06:58,595 --> 01:07:01,462
It might be painful, but the amount is huge.

918
01:07:01,998 --> 01:07:03,329
Is this the right time?

919
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:04,628
Because, now everyone knows...

920
01:07:04,701 --> 01:07:06,293
...there's something called a fake CBI.

921
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:08,638
This is the best time.

922
01:07:09,806 --> 01:07:11,000
I'll call you later.

923
01:07:11,074 --> 01:07:12,268
Look after yourself.

924
01:07:17,714 --> 01:07:19,477
What's the address?
- Chandigarh.

925
01:07:19,616 --> 01:07:20,878
Shall I get him?

926
01:07:22,953 --> 01:07:24,386
And what will you do after that?

927
01:07:25,622 --> 01:07:27,817
Lock him up, interrogate him.

928
01:07:27,924 --> 01:07:29,892
He'll be released the next day.

929
01:07:30,393 --> 01:07:31,985
No one will testify against him.

930
01:07:32,762 --> 01:07:34,354
Say hello to him.
- Yes, sir.

931
01:07:35,365 --> 01:07:36,525
What?

932
01:07:37,234 --> 01:07:38,565
Tape his calls.

933
01:08:38,662 --> 01:08:44,430
Even if Lord or this world forsakes me.

934
01:08:44,834 --> 01:08:51,171
Even if my body or my soul deceives me.

935
01:08:51,675 --> 01:08:57,011
But my beloved, the love between us...

936
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:01,483
Let the love between us stay forever.

937
01:09:01,551 --> 01:09:06,579
The love between us...

938
01:09:07,924 --> 01:09:09,824
When did you arrive?
- Yesterday.

939
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:12,012
We're leaving now?

940
01:09:12,013 --> 01:09:13,194
But my luggage.

941
01:09:13,263 --> 01:09:14,548
No, not today.

942
01:09:14,549 --> 01:09:15,925
- Why a taxi?

943
01:09:16,566 --> 01:09:17,999
Where's your car?

944
01:09:18,535 --> 01:09:19,661
I sold it.

945
01:09:28,078 --> 01:09:29,545
Make him quiet.

946
01:09:34,751 --> 01:09:36,981
Hello.
- Hello.

947
01:09:37,187 --> 01:09:38,620
I'm from the telephone exchange.

948
01:09:38,722 --> 01:09:40,747
225463?
- Yes.

949
01:09:40,824 --> 01:09:42,291
Is there a disturbance in the line?

950
01:09:43,293 --> 01:09:44,385
No.

951
01:09:44,828 --> 01:09:46,090
Then why lodge a complaint.

952
01:09:46,396 --> 01:09:48,023
But we didn't.

953
01:09:48,631 --> 01:09:50,326
225463?

954
01:09:51,001 --> 01:09:52,468
That's my number.

955
01:09:52,702 --> 01:09:54,670
Then someone else from your family must have.

956
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:56,231
Show me your phone.

957
01:09:57,540 --> 01:09:58,632
Come.

958
01:10:10,153 --> 01:10:11,347
Here's the phone.

959
01:10:13,923 --> 01:10:15,515
There's a slight disturbance.

960
01:10:17,494 --> 01:10:18,672
I don't hear a thing.

961
01:10:18,673 --> 01:10:20,019
- What are you saying?

962
01:10:21,131 --> 01:10:22,962
Don't you hear a 'Whoosh' sound?

963
01:10:25,201 --> 01:10:27,601
I don't hear anything.

964
01:10:28,104 --> 01:10:30,971
It's worse for the caller on the other side.

965
01:10:31,174 --> 01:10:32,266
I'll show you.

966
01:10:32,509 --> 01:10:36,001
These two wires shouldn't touch each other.

967
01:10:36,346 --> 01:10:40,009
If they do, then you hear that 'Whoosh' sound.

968
01:10:40,316 --> 01:10:42,284
Don't you clean it?

969
01:10:43,486 --> 01:10:44,578
That's the problem.

970
01:10:44,687 --> 01:10:46,348
People don't clean their telephone sets...

971
01:10:46,423 --> 01:10:48,721
...and we're burdened with all the work.

972
01:10:49,793 --> 01:10:51,693
You see, the circumference can be cleaned...

973
01:10:51,761 --> 01:10:53,786
...from inside as well as outside.

974
01:10:56,399 --> 01:10:57,559
Let's check.

975
01:11:01,471 --> 01:11:02,768
Hello, sir.

976
01:11:04,541 --> 01:11:07,635
Hello.
- 225463.

977
01:11:08,044 --> 01:11:09,272
All okay, sir?

978
01:11:09,379 --> 01:11:10,505
Yes, all okay.

979
01:11:10,613 --> 01:11:12,638
Any disturbance?

980
01:11:12,715 --> 01:11:14,615
Gurmeet, disconnect the call and get out.

981
01:11:16,252 --> 01:11:17,514
Fine, sir.

982
01:11:20,356 --> 01:11:21,755
That's done.

983
01:11:26,162 --> 01:11:27,629
When are you leaving again?

984
01:11:28,465 --> 01:11:29,659
Today evening.

985
01:11:29,933 --> 01:11:31,127
And when will you return?

986
01:11:32,969 --> 01:11:34,061
Never.

987
01:11:35,605 --> 01:11:36,731
Why?

988
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:40,505
Because soon the local police will be looking for me.

989
01:11:41,511 --> 01:11:42,773
Is it important?

990
01:11:45,615 --> 01:11:47,014
Last time.

991
01:11:47,317 --> 01:11:48,648
And what if something happens this time?

992
01:11:48,718 --> 01:11:50,015
Don't scare me.

993
01:11:52,222 --> 01:11:54,816
We'll meet directly on Thursday now.

994
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:57,018
4 o'clock, in the airport.

995
01:11:59,562 --> 01:12:02,224
Ajay, I'm willing to leave with you right now.

996
01:12:03,066 --> 01:12:04,795
Do you have to take this risk?
- Priya...

997
01:12:05,168 --> 01:12:06,533
Why don't you understand?

998
01:12:06,636 --> 01:12:07,864
What if something goes wrong?

999
01:12:07,937 --> 01:12:10,132
Nothing will happen?
- What if something does?

1000
01:12:10,206 --> 01:12:11,901
Nothing will happen, Priya?
- Ajay.

1001
01:12:13,443 --> 01:12:15,070
If anything happens to you, I...

1002
01:12:19,182 --> 01:12:20,513
Shall I leave you home?

1003
01:12:21,518 --> 01:12:22,883
How much more will you leave me?

1004
01:12:23,286 --> 01:12:30,715
Just you... you dwell in my heart.

1005
01:12:30,827 --> 01:12:37,790
Just like dreams... in my eyes.

1006
01:12:37,967 --> 01:12:41,630
Without you... my eyes brim with tears.

1007
01:12:41,738 --> 01:12:45,367
Without you... I don't exist either.

1008
01:12:45,441 --> 01:12:52,540
You mean everything to me.

1009
01:12:52,849 --> 01:13:00,415
Just you... you dwell in my heart.

1010
01:13:00,490 --> 01:13:08,454
Just like dreams... in my eyes.

1011
01:13:49,239 --> 01:13:56,577
Love... picks only a handful few.

1012
01:13:56,746 --> 01:14:03,845
Gives them dreams, and sorrows.

1013
01:14:04,821 --> 01:14:11,488
Shatters all their dreams in a minute.

1014
01:14:12,128 --> 01:14:15,655
It can ruin one.

1015
01:14:15,965 --> 01:14:19,457
Without you... my eyes brim with tears.

1016
01:14:19,569 --> 01:14:23,198
Without you... I don't exist either.

1017
01:14:23,273 --> 01:14:26,936
You mean everything to me.

1018
01:14:27,143 --> 01:14:34,549
Just you... you dwell in my heart.

1019
01:14:34,617 --> 01:14:43,218
Just like dreams... in my eyes.

1020
01:14:48,831 --> 01:14:52,028
Sister... Sister...

1021
01:15:14,123 --> 01:15:21,529
The journey that's love...
is a short one.

1022
01:15:21,597 --> 01:15:28,560
But lovers... are always treading on this path.

1023
01:15:29,706 --> 01:15:36,373
The path of love is a never-ending one.

1024
01:15:37,013 --> 01:15:40,642
It's undying.

1025
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:44,379
Without you... my eyes brim with tears.

1026
01:15:44,454 --> 01:15:48,083
Without you... I don't exist either.

1027
01:15:48,191 --> 01:15:51,888
You mean everything to me.

1028
01:15:51,961 --> 01:15:59,390
Just you... you dwell in my heart.

1029
01:15:59,502 --> 01:16:06,772
Just like dreams... in my eyes.

1030
01:16:57,059 --> 01:17:00,119
Operator, 0172225463.

1031
01:17:09,005 --> 01:17:10,734
Hello.
- Hello.

1032
01:17:11,174 --> 01:17:12,300
Yes, Ajju.

1033
01:17:12,875 --> 01:17:13,967
Did you get the tickets?

1034
01:17:14,177 --> 01:17:15,235
Yes, I did.

1035
01:17:15,511 --> 01:17:17,035
Did you talk to Joginder and lqbal?

1036
01:17:17,213 --> 01:17:18,544
Yes, I did.

1037
01:17:18,714 --> 01:17:20,375
They will meet you at Delhi Airport.

1038
01:17:20,983 --> 01:17:22,075
I see.

1039
01:17:22,785 --> 01:17:24,616
What's wrong? You sound worried.

1040
01:17:26,155 --> 01:17:27,486
Nothing, just tired.

1041
01:17:28,691 --> 01:17:30,352
You're not allowed to tire right now.

1042
01:17:30,660 --> 01:17:33,458
Once we do this last job, you can retire for good.

1043
01:17:35,898 --> 01:17:38,196
See you tomorrow at the airport.
Goodnight.

1044
01:17:38,668 --> 01:17:39,930
Goodnight, son.

1045
01:17:51,914 --> 01:17:53,404
Did you talk to Joginder and lqbal?

1046
01:17:55,785 --> 01:17:58,549
Once we do this last job,you can retire for good.

1047
01:18:04,093 --> 01:18:05,185
Yes, Deepak.

1048
01:18:05,361 --> 01:18:07,488
Where did Sharma get the last call from?

1049
01:18:09,398 --> 01:18:12,731
Bombay, Sea Castle.

1050
01:18:13,603 --> 01:18:17,061
435276.

1051
01:18:17,473 --> 01:18:18,531
Room no?

1052
01:18:19,342 --> 01:18:20,570
1453.

1053
01:18:21,477 --> 01:18:23,638
Sir, Sharma received a call from some Ajju from Bombay.

1054
01:18:23,713 --> 01:18:26,580
Ajju's staying in Sea Castle,room no. 1453.

1055
01:18:26,949 --> 01:18:28,314
Sir, Sharma will be meeting...

1056
01:18:28,384 --> 01:18:30,852
...some Joginder and lqbal at Delhi airport tomorrow.

1057
01:18:31,087 --> 01:18:33,146
And they will leave for Bombay in the evening.

1058
01:18:33,656 --> 01:18:35,886
Ajju will pick them up from Bombay airport.

1059
01:18:36,459 --> 01:18:39,053
Sir, they were mentioning something about a last job.

1060
01:18:40,229 --> 01:18:41,890
Send someone after Sharma.

1061
01:18:42,231 --> 01:18:44,927
I want details of his every movement from Chandigarh to here.

1062
01:18:45,535 --> 01:18:46,934
Call Solanki at Bombay office...

1063
01:18:47,036 --> 01:18:48,196
Sir, Solanki's been transferred.

1064
01:18:48,271 --> 01:18:49,499
Who's been appointed in his place?

1065
01:18:51,173 --> 01:18:52,265
Solanki, sir.

1066
01:18:54,677 --> 01:18:56,269
Tell him to get all the information on Ajju's.

1067
01:18:56,746 --> 01:18:59,271
And book three tickets for tomorrow for Bombay.

1068
01:18:59,348 --> 01:19:00,440
Yes, sir.

1069
01:19:02,018 --> 01:19:03,144
Show me this one again.

1070
01:19:03,419 --> 01:19:05,284
I'll be back soon.

1071
01:19:05,354 --> 01:19:05,613
Yes.

1072
01:19:05,614 --> 01:19:06,651
- Don't worry.

1073
01:19:06,856 --> 01:19:09,381
Fix the bedroom latch.
- Yes.

1074
01:19:09,792 --> 01:19:10,661
And look after him.

1075
01:19:10,662 --> 01:19:11,128
Okay.

1076
01:19:11,129 --> 01:19:11,555
- Yes.

1077
01:19:11,661 --> 01:19:13,458
See you.
Okay.

1078
01:21:03,472 --> 01:21:04,564
That's the three.

1079
01:21:06,709 --> 01:21:08,370
Excuse me.
Phone please.

1080
01:21:21,457 --> 01:21:24,426
They say Gyaani Dayal Singh isn't President...

1081
01:21:24,527 --> 01:21:25,960
...it's Rajiv Gandhi.

1082
01:22:04,767 --> 01:22:05,859
Yes.

1083
01:22:09,305 --> 01:22:10,465
Here.

1084
01:22:12,742 --> 01:22:14,209
20 rupees.

1085
01:22:16,112 --> 01:22:17,340
Thank you.

1086
01:22:26,922 --> 01:22:29,823
That man who just left, what ad did he give you to publish?

1087
01:22:30,192 --> 01:22:31,318
This one.

1088
01:23:15,304 --> 01:23:16,896
Follow that taxi.
Come on.

1089
01:23:47,970 --> 01:23:49,096
Hello.
- Thank you.

1090
01:23:50,439 --> 01:23:51,531
Sir.
- Jai Hind.

1091
01:23:51,707 --> 01:23:53,402
You've to keep an eye on the people that just went inside.

1092
01:24:20,803 --> 01:24:21,895
Sir, this is our team and...

1093
01:24:21,971 --> 01:24:23,404
...they will be working with us on this team.

1094
01:24:23,939 --> 01:24:25,930
Okay, let's start from Ajju.

1095

01:24:29,778 --> 01:24:32,645
He's given a address of Trivandrum in the register.

1098
01:24:32,882 --> 01:24:33,974
I checked it out, sir.

1099
01:24:34,116 --> 01:24:35,208
That address was a fake.

1100
01:24:35,351 --> 01:24:37,683
Sir, today morning he left the hotel and went to 'Jhari Mandi'.

1101
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:40,184
It's a notoriously famous place known for forgery.

1102
01:24:40,322 --> 01:24:43,155
Sir, from there he went to a local ad booking agency in Bandra.

1103
01:24:43,325 --> 01:24:45,418
He's booked this ad for tomorrow.

01:25:06,682 --> 01:25:08,582
...at Hotel Sea Castle.

1111
01:25:08,851 --> 01:25:12,343

1112
01:25:12,855 --> 01:25:13,440
What's this...

1113
01:25:13,441 --> 01:25:14,652
- This is really big, Ajju.

1114
01:25:14,757 --> 01:25:15,849
Because it's the last one.

1115
01:25:16,759 --> 01:25:18,784
But why do you need so many people?

1116
01:25:19,495 --> 01:25:20,621
Because it's a big job.

1117
01:25:21,463 --> 01:25:23,693
Consider that we'll need public support.

1118
01:25:24,667 --> 01:25:26,294
They're planning something big.

1119
01:25:27,102 --> 01:25:28,228
Where else did Ajju go?

1120
01:25:28,337 --> 01:25:29,463
From Bandra he went to the airport.

1121
01:25:29,571 --> 01:25:31,596

1123
01:25:33,642 --> 01:25:34,422
We need a new base.

1124
01:25:34,423 --> 01:25:36,063
The closer to their hotel, the better.

1125
01:25:36,064 --> 01:25:36,668
- Yes.

1126
01:25:36,745 --> 01:25:38,838
I need 10-12 people for their interview.

1127
01:25:39,048 --> 01:25:40,640
Give me some really smart men...

1128
01:25:40,716 --> 01:25:42,581
...who can crack their interview.

1129
01:25:43,819 --> 01:25:47,755
Let's find out what they exactly want.

1130
01:25:48,090 --> 01:25:49,216
Sir.

1131
01:25:49,291 --> 01:25:50,383
Sir.

1132
01:25:50,559 --> 01:25:52,288
Why not go ask Sharma directly?

1133
01:25:55,164 --> 01:25:58,190
Ranveer, I know why you're in a hurry to meet Sharma?

1134
01:25:59,501 --> 01:26:02,402
But, use my mind as well.

1135
01:26:03,072 --> 01:26:04,232
Do you get that?

1136
01:26:06,041 --> 01:26:07,133

Mother!

1145
01:27:56,485 --> 01:27:58,453
All you do is eat and sleep the entire day.

1146
01:27:58,620 --> 01:27:59,985
You don't move a muscle.

1147
01:28:00,055 --> 01:28:01,682
Look at this ad.

But our selection process isn't over yet.

1248
01:35:26,968 --> 01:35:28,026
Tomorrow...

1249
01:35:28,503 --> 01:35:30,767
Stand straight.
Straight!

1250
01:35:32,974 --> 01:35:36,000

...that will conduct a raid.

1258
01:35:56,598 --> 01:35:58,589
The whole idea of putting you guys in this situation...

1259
01:35:58,700 --> 01:36:01,396
...is to verify if you can handle pressure or not.

1260
01:36:01,570 --> 01:36:04,130
Or let me correct myself, whether you can handle...

1261
01:36:04,205 --> 01:36:05,900
...extreme pressure or not.

1262
01:36:23,825 --> 01:36:25,884
Hey.
Don't be scared, get it.

Whoever it maybe, Whoosh.

1267
01:36:34,202 --> 01:36:34,772
That's all.

1268
01:36:34,773 --> 01:36:35,965
We will sweep him up!

Boss.

1270
01:36:36,711 --> 01:36:39,268

1271
01:36:39,608 --> 01:36:40,666
Good.

1272
01:36:44,746 --> 01:36:46,008
Patel.
- Yes, sir.

1273
01:36:46,214 --> 01:36:48,114
Do yourjob with hard work...

1274
01:36:48,183 --> 01:36:51,050
...that law-breakers start sweating thinking about us.

1275
01:36:51,186 --> 01:36:52,278
Yes, sir.

1276
01:36:55,624 --> 01:36:58,092
There's 4 of you and 22 of them.

1277
01:36:58,760 --> 01:37:00,250
This isn't discrimination.

1278
01:37:00,929 --> 01:37:04,831
4 of you can do what these 22 can.

1279
01:37:05,333 --> 01:37:08,734
I believe and trust you.
- Thank you, sir.

1280
01:37:08,970 --> 01:37:10,597
Remember one thing.

1281
01:37:11,172 --> 01:37:13,265
Real power comes from the heart.

1282
01:37:14,209 --> 01:37:16,302
Don't ever be scared of anyone in life.

1283
01:37:16,711 --> 01:37:18,474
Understood?
- Yes, sir.

1284
01:37:19,147 --> 01:37:20,546
After the completion of the raid...

1285
01:37:20,615 --> 01:37:23,175
...you will all report back here, and if nothing goes wrong...

1286
01:37:23,251 --> 01:37:25,549
...everyone will get their appointment letter.

1287
01:37:25,854 --> 01:37:29,620
And then, you can all throw a small party for all.

1288
01:37:30,125 --> 01:37:31,285
Sure, sir.

1289
01:37:35,897 --> 01:37:39,560
Ladies and Gentlemen, you're just one step away from...

1290
01:37:39,668 --> 01:37:43,968
...becoming a part of India's best and intellectual agency.

1291
01:37:44,172 --> 01:37:47,733
CBI means, that you love your country above everything else.

1292
01:37:48,143 --> 01:37:50,304
CBI means, that you will live for your country...

1293
01:37:50,378 --> 01:37:52,141
...and that you will die for your country.

1294
01:37:52,380 --> 01:37:54,541
CBI means, that you're the best.

1295
01:37:55,016 --> 01:37:55,996
Are you the best?

1296
01:37:55,997 --> 01:37:56,745
- Yes, sir.

1297
01:37:56,851 --> 01:37:58,546
Are you the best?
- Yes, sir.

1298
01:37:58,620 --> 01:37:59,825
I can't hear you.

1299
01:37:59,826 --> 01:38:00,747
- Yes, sir!

1300
01:38:00,822 --> 01:38:03,290
I still can't hear you.
- Yes, sir!

1301
01:38:03,358 --> 01:38:05,417
These discussions shouldn't leave this room.

1302
01:38:05,794 --> 01:38:07,320
Do you understand?

1303
01:38:07,321 --> 01:38:08,422
- Yes, sir!

1304
01:38:08,663 --> 01:38:09,857
Dismiss.

1305
01:38:20,341 --> 01:38:21,501
Thank you, sir.

1306
01:38:22,277 --> 01:38:23,471
Good luck.

1307
01:38:26,848 --> 01:38:28,008
Great.

1308
01:38:28,750 --> 01:38:31,878
For a minute I forgot that we're thieves.

1309
01:38:35,356 --> 01:38:37,153
They asked us the full form of CBI.

1310
01:38:37,258 --> 01:38:38,623
They even asked me my favourite song.

1311
01:38:38,727 --> 01:38:40,319
They've asked us to report at the conference room...

1312
01:38:40,428 --> 01:38:42,225
...tomorrow at 11 am, for some lecture.

1313
01:38:42,297 --> 01:38:44,356
They said we'll go out for a raid post-lunch.

1314
01:38:44,532 --> 01:38:44,912
Where?

1315
01:38:44,913 --> 01:38:46,432
- They haven't said that yet.

1316
01:38:47,102 --> 01:38:47,720
Anything else?

1317
01:38:47,721 --> 01:38:49,662
- They said Congratulations, I'm the best.

1318
01:38:50,338 --> 01:38:51,737
He said I am the best, sir.

1319
01:38:55,610 --> 01:38:56,736
Fine.

1320
01:38:56,911 --> 01:38:58,538
You can go and report their tomorrow.

1321
01:38:59,180 --> 01:39:01,114
Be sharp and alert.
- Sir!

1322
01:40:36,177 --> 01:40:36,667
See you.

1323
01:40:36,668 --> 01:40:37,769
- Bye.
Goodnight

1324
01:40:38,012 --> 01:40:40,037
Goodnight.
- Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight.

1325
01:40:40,114 --> 01:40:41,604
Sleep well.
s- Goodnight.

1326
01:40:57,065 --> 01:40:58,327
Who is it?

1327
01:41:01,169 --> 01:41:01,720
Who is it?

1328
01:41:01,721 --> 01:41:02,932
- Room service, sir.

1329
01:41:08,476 --> 01:41:11,502
The queen of my dreams, when will you come.

1330
01:41:11,579 --> 01:41:13,479
Life is passing by, when will you come?

1331
01:41:13,548 --> 01:41:14,742
Come in.

1332
01:41:43,711 --> 01:41:45,269
How are you, Mr. Sharma?

1333
01:41:47,815 --> 01:41:49,407
We're from the CBI.

1334
01:41:51,519 --> 01:41:52,747
The real one.

1335
01:41:57,358 --> 01:41:58,484
So, Mr. Sharma.

1336
01:41:58,993 --> 01:42:01,291
You like playing cops-and-robbers, don't you?

1337
01:42:01,663 --> 01:42:04,826
No, I was just...

1338
01:42:05,733 --> 01:42:09,066
I will ask you some questions,and you will have two
options.

1339
01:42:09,337 --> 01:42:10,929
Firstly, you will deny everything...

1340
01:42:11,039 --> 01:42:12,904
...and say you don't know anything.

1341
01:42:12,974 --> 01:42:14,999
In that condition, we'll be compelled to do it and...

1342
01:42:15,109 --> 01:42:20,376
...in places, which was never done to you before by anyone.

1343
01:42:21,516 --> 01:42:24,542
It will cause you a lot of pain but, believe me...

1344
01:42:24,619 --> 01:42:28,453
...you will suddenly remember everything in detail.

1345
01:42:29,090 --> 01:42:30,057
I... I...

1346
01:42:30,158 --> 01:42:33,491
Your second option is that you cooperate with us...

1347
01:42:33,594 --> 01:42:35,858
...and save our time and effort.

1348
01:42:35,997 --> 01:42:37,430
This option won't cause you any pain...

1349
01:42:37,498 --> 01:42:40,296
...and you can expect us to be slightly lenient with us.

1350
01:42:43,838 --> 01:42:45,237
So, let's begin.

1351
01:42:45,473 --> 01:42:47,668
First question, where's your fake CBI team...

1352
01:42:47,742 --> 01:42:49,073
...going to conduct a raid tomorrow?

1353
01:42:49,143 --> 01:42:51,077
Bhuvandas Singhania Jewels.

1354
01:42:51,179 --> 01:42:53,409
What time?
- 3 pm.

1355
01:42:53,715 --> 01:42:55,307
What's Special 26?

1356
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:03,149
It... was a big place, so we thought...

1357
01:43:03,224 --> 01:43:05,385
...if we have more men with us...

1358
01:43:06,260 --> 01:43:07,488
So you put an ad in the paper...

1359
01:43:07,595 --> 01:43:09,752
...stating Come one, come all, it's a big heist.

1360
01:43:09,753 --> 01:43:10,291
Help us.

1361
01:43:10,398 --> 01:43:11,558
What's the plan?

1362
01:43:13,968 --> 01:43:15,629
Tomorrow morning we'll give them training.

1363
01:43:15,703 --> 01:43:16,863
Training?

1364
01:43:19,974 --> 01:43:22,772
I mean we'd explain them their role...

1365
01:43:22,877 --> 01:43:25,437
...like what to do, how to do it.

1366
01:43:26,214 --> 01:43:31,174
We would explain them all that and prepare them.

1367
01:43:31,452 --> 01:43:36,617
And then at 2:30, our bus would reach the hotel.

1368
01:44:08,156 --> 01:44:09,316
Then?

1369
01:44:10,858 --> 01:44:13,850
We were supposed to go to Opera House in it...

1370
01:44:13,928 --> 01:44:17,489
...and conduct a big raid.

1371
01:45:02,210 --> 01:45:04,405
We're from the CBI! No one moves!

1372
01:45:04,512 --> 01:45:06,139
Come on, start.

1373
01:45:09,350 --> 01:45:10,510
Come on, get it.

1374
01:45:10,585 --> 01:45:11,916
Get in, quickly.

1375
01:45:11,986 --> 01:45:13,613
Come on, come on, quickly.

1376
01:45:13,721 --> 01:45:14,847
Hurry up.

1377
01:45:19,393 --> 01:45:22,055
Sir... please sir... sorry sir...

1378
01:45:42,650 --> 01:45:44,345
Pick up everything.

1379
01:45:58,132 --> 01:46:02,296
We would flee before anyone knew what happened?

1380
01:46:02,537 --> 01:46:06,974
We planned to loot 2 crores in 30 minutes.

1381
01:46:09,710 --> 01:46:12,304
What's your Ajju's background?

1382
01:46:16,250 --> 01:46:18,241
He wanted to join the CBI.

1383
01:46:27,628 --> 01:46:29,687
He had cleared the written exam.

1384
01:46:30,231 --> 01:46:31,789
But failed in the interview.

1385
01:46:39,774 --> 01:46:42,766
He failed in the exam and he was hurt.

1386
01:46:43,477 --> 01:46:45,502
So he started a fake CBI team.

1387
01:46:48,516 --> 01:46:50,484
How many raids have you conducted so far?

1388
01:46:55,456 --> 01:46:58,289
We were supposed to complete half century tomorrow.

1389
01:46:58,359 --> 01:46:59,553
What the...

1390
01:47:00,328 --> 01:47:02,387
I've to admit one thing.

1391
01:47:03,130 --> 01:47:04,358
There's just four of you...

1392
01:47:04,432 --> 01:47:06,662
...but you've spread a chaos.

1393
01:47:08,002 --> 01:47:09,469
Not four.

1394
01:47:11,439 --> 01:47:14,203
People like him help us as well.

1395
01:47:15,309 --> 01:47:17,777
Sir, can I talk to him in private for a minute?

1396
01:47:18,279 --> 01:47:21,112
Why a minute, you can talk to him all you want tomorrow.

1397
01:47:21,249 --> 01:47:22,477
Yes.

1398
01:47:22,817 --> 01:47:24,409
So, tell us, Mr. Sharma.

1399
01:47:25,152 --> 01:47:27,882
Do you want to be safe or go down with them?

1400
01:47:28,256 --> 01:47:29,382
Let me tell you...

1401
01:47:29,490 --> 01:47:31,481
...jail isn't a great place for people of your age.

1402
01:47:33,794 --> 01:47:36,820
Sir... sir, another option.

1403
01:47:36,931 --> 01:47:39,661
I've children.

1404
01:47:39,767 --> 01:47:41,997
You should've thought that before.

1405
01:47:42,837 --> 01:47:45,067
I did...

1406
01:47:45,306 --> 01:47:48,104
Tell us. We don't have time.

1407
01:47:53,080 --> 01:47:54,911
Mr. Sharma.

1408
01:48:06,360 --> 01:48:08,123
What will I have to do?

1409
01:48:08,696 --> 01:48:11,187
Just do as you were supposed to.

1410
01:48:11,632 --> 01:48:13,657
Forget that we ever met.

1411
01:48:13,768 --> 01:48:16,669
Everything should go as it was supposed to.

1412
01:48:16,771 --> 01:48:19,569
Let me tell you, that a few of our officers...

1413
01:48:19,640 --> 01:48:21,437
...are in your Special 26 team.

1414
01:48:21,909 --> 01:48:23,968
So don't try to act smart.

1415
01:48:24,312 --> 01:48:28,271
I want to arrest them, not kill them.

1416
01:48:38,292 --> 01:48:39,486
What's wrong?

1417
01:48:42,029 --> 01:48:44,361
I just remembered something.

1418
01:48:44,999 --> 01:48:49,436
Ajju always said There's no one who can catch him.

1419
01:48:52,106 --> 01:48:55,098
Over-confidence has led to the downfall of many, Mr. Sharma.

1420
01:48:55,643 --> 01:48:57,838
Ajju's no different.

1421
01:49:02,149 --> 01:49:04,049
Will you treat him too harsh...

1422
01:49:04,118 --> 01:49:06,848
Stop worrying about him and think about yourself.

1423
01:49:07,355 --> 01:49:08,686
Get some sleep.

1424
01:49:08,756 --> 01:49:10,781
You've a busy day tomorrow.

1425
01:49:11,759 --> 01:49:12,953
Goodnight.

1426
01:49:35,015 --> 01:49:36,880
Brief More and Gupte again.

1427
01:49:36,951 --> 01:49:37,975
We'll meet tomorrow morning.

1428
01:49:38,052 --> 01:49:39,883
Goodnight.
- Goodnight, sir.

1429
01:49:47,995 --> 01:49:49,553
Sorry.
- It's okay.

1430
01:50:42,883 --> 01:50:44,111
Sir.

1431
01:50:50,458 --> 01:50:52,255
All that money for one drink?

1432
01:50:52,593 --> 01:50:54,788
How much?
- 30 ml.

1433
01:50:55,396 --> 01:50:57,523
Anything smaller?
- No, sir.

1434
01:50:58,332 --> 01:50:59,924
Fine. Get me this one.

1435
01:51:00,601 --> 01:51:01,863
Okay, sir.

1436
01:51:11,212 --> 01:51:12,372
Hello.

1437
01:51:12,813 --> 01:51:14,041
Hello.

1438
01:51:14,748 --> 01:51:16,613
Waseem.
- Wardhan.

1439
01:51:18,752 --> 01:51:20,481
What do you do, Mr. Wardhan?

1440
01:51:21,155 --> 01:51:22,452
Import-export.

1441
01:51:22,523 --> 01:51:23,854
Excuse me, sir.

1442
01:51:23,924 --> 01:51:25,323
Sir, your drink.

1443
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:27,208
Sir, soda?

1444
01:51:27,209 --> 01:51:28,892
- I didn't ask for soda.

1445
01:51:28,996 --> 01:51:30,224
Sir, it's complimentary.

1446
01:51:30,364 --> 01:51:33,197
Go ahead, pour it. That's it.

1447
01:51:33,300 --> 01:51:34,892
Sir, water.
- Yes.

1448
01:51:37,271 --> 01:51:38,761
What do you do?

1449
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:41,330
Government job.

1450
01:51:43,777 --> 01:51:44,869
What are you saying?

1451
01:51:44,945 --> 01:51:46,606
The government works?

1452
01:51:46,680 --> 01:51:48,739
Cheers.
- Oh... Cheers.

1453
01:51:50,751 --> 01:51:53,049
You've a lot of complaints with the government.

1454
01:51:53,120 --> 01:51:55,748
Only the weak complain, Mr. Waseem.

1455
01:51:56,557 --> 01:51:58,320
And people like you.

1456
01:51:58,526 --> 01:52:01,689
People like me just have their drink and live their life.

1457
01:52:01,762 --> 01:52:03,024
What else?

1458
01:52:03,130 --> 01:52:04,654
What a thought.

1459
01:52:07,434 --> 01:52:08,765
Waiter.
- Sir.

1460
01:52:09,203 --> 01:52:11,103
Put the tab on my room.
- Sure, sir.

1461
01:52:11,272 --> 01:52:13,206
Goodnight, Mr. Waseem.
- Goodnight.

1462
01:52:15,509 --> 01:52:17,306
Wardhan sir.
- Yes.

1463
01:52:17,545 --> 01:52:20,013
I think you dropped your money.

1464
01:52:23,751 --> 01:52:25,150
Is this yours?

1465
01:52:25,486 --> 01:52:26,851
Yes, it's mine.

1466
01:52:26,987 --> 01:52:28,284
Thank you.

1467
01:52:31,926 --> 01:52:33,553
What an attitude?

1468
01:52:34,528 --> 01:52:36,928
I will hunt him down personally.

1469
01:52:56,116 --> 01:52:57,481
Nitin Srivastav.

1470
01:52:58,719 --> 01:52:59,743
Kapil Gorekar.

1471
01:52:59,853 --> 01:53:00,842
Archana Mansekar.

1472
01:53:00,955 --> 01:53:01,979
Thank you.

1473
01:53:02,089 --> 01:53:03,078
Minal Jain.

1474
01:53:03,157 --> 01:53:04,488
Harish Pendekar.

1475
01:53:27,915 --> 01:53:28,939
Good morning.

1476
01:53:29,016 --> 01:53:29,492
Good morning, sir.

1477
01:53:29,493 --> 01:53:30,074
- Good morning, sir.

1478
01:53:33,654 --> 01:53:35,417
Hail Krishna!

1479
01:53:35,522 --> 01:53:36,546
Hail Krishna!

1480
01:53:36,657 --> 01:53:37,715
Sir.

1481
01:53:37,825 --> 01:53:39,087
Look there.

1482
01:53:53,374 --> 01:53:55,171
Yes, Solanki sir.

1483
01:53:55,409 --> 01:53:57,172
Magandas, this is Mr. Waseem Khan...

1484
01:53:57,244 --> 01:53:58,438
I see...
- From CBI.

1485
01:53:58,512 --> 01:54:00,503
CBI?

1486
01:54:00,881 --> 01:54:04,317
Why CBI...

1487
01:54:04,385 --> 01:54:05,750
That.

1488
01:54:07,187 --> 01:54:08,654
Did you see that?

1489
01:54:10,357 --> 01:54:12,552
That's exactly what they bank on.

1490
01:54:14,428 --> 01:54:17,022
Did you steal anything?
- No.

1491
01:54:17,131 --> 01:54:19,065
Plunder?
- No.

1492
01:54:19,166 --> 01:54:21,157
Then why are you so scared of the CBI?

1493
01:54:23,170 --> 01:54:25,661
Something terrible going to happen with you instead.

1494
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:29,273
Your shop's going to be looted.
- What?

1495
01:54:29,510 --> 01:54:31,000
When?

1496
01:54:31,478 --> 01:54:32,877
Around 3 pm.

1497
01:54:33,447 --> 01:54:35,108
Around 30 people will come here...

1498
01:54:35,215 --> 01:54:37,149
...posing as CBI officers and loot your shop.

1499
01:54:38,752 --> 01:54:40,413
Do you want to avert it?

1500
01:54:41,755 --> 01:54:43,916
Are you telling me or giving me a choice?

1501
01:54:44,491 --> 01:54:47,517
Do you have a safer place?
- Yes.

1502
01:54:47,995 --> 01:54:49,360
My workshop.

1503
01:54:49,430 --> 01:54:50,488
How far?

1504
01:54:50,564 --> 01:54:52,657
20 minutes from here.

1505
01:54:52,966 --> 01:54:54,160
Good.

1506
01:54:54,368 --> 01:54:55,630
We'll replace your store's jewellery...

1507
01:54:55,736 --> 01:54:57,520
...with your fake jewellery that's marked.

1508
01:54:57,521 --> 01:54:57,966
- Yes.

1509
01:54:58,038 --> 01:54:59,767
Shift the entire stock in your shop...

1510
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:02,468
...to your workshop in half an hour.

1511
01:55:02,576 --> 01:55:04,066
Half an hour!
How is it possible, sir?

1512
01:55:04,178 --> 01:55:05,236
It's possible, sir.

1513
01:55:05,312 --> 01:55:07,360
They were going to loot your shop in 30 minutes.

1514
01:55:07,361 --> 01:55:07,872
- I see.

1515
01:55:07,948 --> 01:55:09,472
Only your staff will stay in your shop.

1516
01:55:09,583 --> 01:55:09,888
Okay.

1517
01:55:09,889 --> 01:55:11,107
- Your shop will be closed for the public.

1518
01:55:11,185 --> 01:55:14,211
Some of officers will wait for them posing as customers.

1519
01:55:14,288 --> 01:55:16,654
Sir, when you know all this...

1520
01:55:16,724 --> 01:55:18,783
...why don't you arrest them?

1521
01:55:18,892 --> 01:55:20,382
Sir.
- Yes.

1522
01:55:20,627 --> 01:55:23,687
One cannot be punished for thinking of such crimes.

1523
01:55:23,764 --> 01:55:25,322
Only for committing it.

1524
01:55:25,399 --> 01:55:27,765
And only if we've evidence.

1525
01:55:30,003 --> 01:55:32,995
Remember that, there's no authority over you.

1526
01:55:33,307 --> 01:55:35,571
No one has the power to stop you.

1527
01:55:35,642 --> 01:55:37,507
No one can stop you.

1528
01:55:37,745 --> 01:55:40,236
And no one has the power to come between you...

1529
01:55:40,314 --> 01:55:41,713
...and your duty.

1530
01:55:41,815 --> 01:55:43,806
Understand?
- Yes, sir.

1531
01:56:04,004 --> 01:56:08,304
Grandma.

1532
01:56:12,980 --> 01:56:14,345
I am leaving.

1533
01:57:09,469 --> 01:57:10,561
Keep this in there.

1534
01:57:10,637 --> 01:57:11,899
Keep this over there.

1535
01:57:12,606 --> 01:57:14,301
I'll make a call.
- Yes, sir.

1536
01:57:14,608 --> 01:57:15,905
This one.

1537
01:57:27,654 --> 01:57:29,246
Sir.
- Rahul, what's going on there?

1538
01:57:29,323 --> 01:57:30,688
Training, sir.

1539
01:57:30,757 --> 01:57:32,588
Anything to worry?
- Nothing, sir.

1540
01:57:39,199 --> 01:57:40,598
Solanki.
- Sir.

1541
01:57:44,371 --> 01:57:47,033
No madam, today the shop is closed for customers.

1542
01:57:47,107 --> 01:57:48,335
You please come tomorrow.

1543
01:57:49,443 --> 01:57:50,671
Sir.

1544
01:58:00,087 --> 01:58:01,850
I want a sniper there.
- Yes.

1545
01:58:01,922 --> 01:58:04,186
Send few of your men to both the lanes.

1546
01:58:04,291 --> 01:58:06,585
Two on that corner and two on that one, dressed in civil.

1547
01:58:06,586 --> 01:58:07,158
- Okay.

1548
01:58:07,227 --> 01:58:08,489
Our vehicle should be stationed...

1549
01:58:08,562 --> 01:58:10,203
...exactly where they park their bus, to block it.

1550
01:58:10,204 --> 01:58:10,621
- Okay, sir.

1551
01:58:46,266 --> 01:58:47,255
Open it.

1552
01:58:47,367 --> 01:58:48,391
Quickly.

1553
01:58:48,468 --> 01:58:49,799
Quickly.
- Load it.

1554
01:58:49,870 --> 01:58:50,962
Quickly. Quickly.

1555
01:58:51,038 --> 01:58:52,369
How much longer?
- Sir.

1556
01:58:52,472 --> 01:58:53,962
Just a few more minutes.

1557
01:58:54,041 --> 01:58:56,236
Load the jewels and check the CCTV.
- Sir.

1558
01:58:59,813 --> 01:59:01,007
Come.

1559
01:59:03,150 --> 01:59:04,412
Go.

1560
01:59:13,994 --> 01:59:15,188
Okay, guys.

1561
01:59:15,295 --> 01:59:16,922
You can have your lunch now.

1562
01:59:16,997 --> 01:59:18,259
See you in 30 minutes.

1563
01:59:18,365 --> 01:59:19,764
Thank you, sir.

1564
01:59:39,786 --> 01:59:41,014
What's wrong?

1565
01:59:44,057 --> 01:59:45,251
Nothing.

1566
01:59:46,793 --> 01:59:48,021
Nervous?

1567
01:59:48,929 --> 01:59:50,556
Can't handle it anymore.

1568
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:55,131
I've grown old.

1569
01:59:57,971 --> 01:59:59,233
This is the last one.

1570
01:59:59,473 --> 02:00:00,667
Enjoy it.

1571
02:00:01,775 --> 02:00:05,074
Don't worry. I'm leading today.

1572
02:00:07,114 --> 02:00:09,344
You can leave them in the bus.

1573
02:00:09,683 --> 02:00:12,379
I will come along with Joginder and lqbal in the car.

1574
02:00:13,987 --> 02:00:15,181
Okay.

1595
02:00:30,404 --> 02:00:33,430
Yes, Rahul. - Sir, its lunch-break.
They're on schedule.

1596
02:00:33,573 --> 02:00:35,507
Fine, inform me as soon as the bus leaves from there.

1597
02:00:35,642 --> 02:00:36,700
Right, sir.

1598
02:00:37,878 --> 02:00:38,597
Is everyone ready?

1599
02:00:38,598 --> 02:00:39,675
- We're fully ready, sir.

1600
02:00:39,746 --> 02:00:40,770
Okay.

1601
02:00:40,881 --> 02:00:42,781
CCTV's working perfectly, sir.

1602
02:00:43,050 --> 02:00:45,348
Find out where has the van reached?
- Sir.

1603
02:01:06,773 --> 02:01:08,001
Keep it there.

1604
02:01:16,850 --> 02:01:18,613
Take position.
- Yes, sir.

1605
02:01:37,137 --> 02:01:38,229
You understand that.

1606
02:01:38,338 --> 02:01:39,828
Mr. Roy.
- Yes, sir.

1607
02:01:39,940 --> 02:01:41,202
Sir.

1608
02:02:17,244 --> 02:02:20,645
The bus's no is MRT
- 2431.

1609
02:02:20,847 --> 02:02:22,178
Okay, out.

1610
02:02:26,086 --> 02:02:27,110
Listen, everyone.

1611
02:02:27,220 --> 02:02:28,448
Listen.

1612
02:02:28,522 --> 02:02:30,251
The bus has just left the hotel.

1613
02:02:30,323 --> 02:02:32,382
It will be here in 30 minutes.

1614
02:02:32,526 --> 02:02:35,017
If anyone wants to use the bathroom, do it now.

1615
02:02:35,195 --> 02:02:36,492
Wait for my signal.

1616
02:02:36,563 --> 02:02:41,796
Do not... I repeat, nobody will move until I signal.

1617
02:02:42,869 --> 02:02:44,734
Right?
- Yes, sir.

1618
02:02:46,006 --> 02:02:47,446
Ranveer.
Check the status outside.

1619
02:02:47,447 --> 02:02:47,940
- Yes, sir.

1620
02:02:48,041 --> 02:02:49,565
Sir.
- Yes.

1621
02:02:58,552 --> 02:02:59,917
Hey.

1622
02:03:00,020 --> 02:03:01,640
What are you doing here?
Get to your positions.

1623
02:03:01,641 --> 02:03:02,045
- Sir.

1624
02:03:32,352 --> 02:03:34,650
Sir, we're doing the real job.

1625
02:03:34,721 --> 02:03:36,416
They're just...

1626
02:04:11,491 --> 02:04:14,722
'You'll have to work hard, might pain you as well.'

1627
02:04:14,794 --> 02:04:16,694
'But the money involved is huge.'

1628
02:04:16,763 --> 02:04:18,196
'Is the timing right? '

1629
02:04:18,298 --> 02:04:20,129
'There can't be a better time.'

1630
02:04:48,695 --> 02:04:50,526
Stop at the left.

1631
02:05:01,174 --> 02:05:03,039
Kishen.
- Sir.

1632
02:05:07,080 --> 02:05:08,479
What's this?

1633
02:05:09,416 --> 02:05:11,247
Police Headquarters, sir.

1634
02:05:11,885 --> 02:05:15,184
Kishen, I'll go verify the order papers.

1635
02:05:15,288 --> 02:05:17,153
The rest of you get to Bhuvandas Singhania Jewellers...

1636
02:05:17,257 --> 02:05:18,747
...and wait for me and Wardhan sir.

1637
02:05:18,858 --> 02:05:20,086
No one will get down from the bus...

1638
02:05:20,193 --> 02:05:21,251
...as long we get there.

1639
02:05:21,361 --> 02:05:22,521
That's an order!

1640
02:05:23,096 --> 02:05:24,495
Yes, sir.
- Good.

1641
02:05:28,401 --> 02:05:29,663
Let's go.

1642
02:05:37,777 --> 02:05:39,176
Just a minute, sir.
- Yes.

1643
02:05:39,245 --> 02:05:41,611
Sir, which way to Metro Cinema?

1644
02:05:41,681 --> 02:05:43,046
Go straight and take a left.

1645
02:05:43,116 --> 02:05:44,708
Thank you.

1646
02:06:00,400 --> 02:06:03,233
Yes. 
- So, you wanted to talk to me in private?

1647
02:06:03,336 --> 02:06:05,272
You were acting too smart.

1648
02:06:05,273 --> 02:06:06,464
I'll slap you.

1649
02:06:06,906 --> 02:06:09,063
Come on, change your clothes in the jeep.

1650
02:06:09,064 --> 02:06:09,602
- Yes.

1651
02:06:09,843 --> 02:06:11,811
Shanti.
- Sir.

1652
02:06:11,878 --> 02:06:13,971
How are you?
- Fine.

1653
02:06:39,205 --> 02:06:40,695
Stop at the side.

1654
02:06:50,183 --> 02:06:51,411
Shinde.
- Sir.

1655
02:06:51,484 --> 02:06:54,180
Don't let anyone in.
- Yes, sir.

1656
02:06:58,124 --> 02:06:59,386
Who are you?

1657
02:07:07,333 --> 02:07:08,994
Come on.
This is a CBI raid.

1658
02:07:09,068 --> 02:07:10,228
Everyone stop working.

1659
02:07:10,336 --> 02:07:12,065
Come on.
Stop working.

1660
02:07:12,172 --> 02:07:13,025
It's a CBI raid.

1661
02:07:13,026 --> 02:07:14,037
- Stop your work.

1662
02:07:14,107 --> 02:07:14,886
Stop your work.

1663
02:07:14,887 --> 02:07:15,768
- Stop working.

1664
02:07:15,842 --> 02:07:17,077
Close that file. I said...
Come on.

1665
02:07:17,078 --> 02:07:17,901
- I said stop the work.

1666
02:07:18,011 --> 02:07:19,308
Get up.
-Get up.

1667
02:07:19,412 --> 02:07:20,743
Stop your work.

1668
02:07:22,549 --> 02:07:24,278
Madam, come on.
Hurry up.

1669
02:07:24,350 --> 02:07:24,947
This way.

1670
02:07:24,948 --> 02:07:26,341
- Come on.
Get out.

1671
02:07:26,419 --> 02:07:27,521
Leave him.
Hurry up.

1672
02:07:27,522 --> 02:07:28,182
- Come on.

1673
02:07:28,254 --> 02:07:29,380
Check their account books.

1674
02:07:29,489 --> 02:07:30,434
Check their account books.

1675
02:07:30,435 --> 02:07:31,889
- No one will touch the account books.

1676
02:07:31,958 --> 02:07:34,001
Keep the account books down.

1677
02:07:34,002 --> 02:07:34,950
No changes.

1678
02:07:35,028 --> 02:07:37,053
I said no changes...
What's written in this?

1679
02:07:37,697 --> 02:07:39,961
Hey.
 Keep the phone down?

1680
02:07:44,604 --> 02:07:46,071
Sir.
- What's written here?

1681
02:07:46,172 --> 02:07:47,190
What are these entries?

1682
02:07:47,191 --> 02:07:48,163
- I don't know, sir.

1683
02:07:48,241 --> 02:07:49,299
It's not my mistake.

1684
02:07:49,409 --> 02:07:50,501
Give me that account book.

1685
02:07:50,610 --> 02:07:51,163
What is this?

1686
02:07:51,164 --> 02:07:52,100
- Sir, I don't know.

1687
02:07:52,212 --> 02:07:53,509
What's this?

1688
02:07:53,613 --> 02:07:55,308
All your goods can be seized?

1689
02:07:55,415 --> 02:07:55,949
Do you know that?

1690
02:07:55,950 --> 02:07:56,609
- Sir, please, sir.

1691
02:07:56,716 --> 02:07:58,911
You don't have one proper paper.
- Sir.

1692
02:07:59,786 --> 02:08:01,185
Roy.
Seize everything.

1693
02:08:01,254 --> 02:08:02,278
But, sir...
- Shut up!

1694
02:08:02,355 --> 02:08:03,319
Sir asked me to do this.

1695
02:08:03,320 --> 02:08:05,085
- Bring your sir to Crime Branch.
Come on.

1696
02:08:05,158 --> 02:08:06,090
Open the vault door.
Come on.

1697
02:08:06,091 --> 02:08:06,989
- Sir, I will lose my job.

1698
02:08:07,060 --> 02:08:08,584
Good that you do.
- Sir.

1699
02:08:08,695 --> 02:08:10,060
Open it, quickly.

1700
02:08:11,097 --> 02:08:14,396
Come on.
You two, out. Out.

1701
02:08:18,805 --> 02:08:20,616
You haven't got a single proper entry in this register.

1702
02:08:20,617 --> 02:08:21,069
- Sir.

1703
02:08:21,174 --> 02:08:22,300
Come with me...
- Listen to me...

1704
02:08:22,408 --> 02:08:23,773
What's written here?

1705
02:08:23,843 --> 02:08:25,276
What's this?

1706
02:08:57,644 --> 02:08:59,077
Keep this inside.

1707
02:08:59,212 --> 02:09:00,474
This one too.

1708
02:09:01,147 --> 02:09:02,978
Greed is not good.

1709
02:09:03,917 --> 02:09:05,214
Keep that out.

1710
02:09:05,418 --> 02:09:06,851
That one too.

1711
02:09:07,387 --> 02:09:08,684
Keep that one.

1712
02:09:08,888 --> 02:09:10,549
Yes, that one too.

1713
02:09:33,146 --> 02:09:35,307
Sign here.
Write your name here. Name.

1714
02:09:35,415 --> 02:09:36,780
Come on, hurry up.

1715
02:09:37,317 --> 02:09:38,716
Yes, thank you.

1716
02:09:53,633 --> 02:09:55,658
Careful.
Hurry up.

1717
02:09:55,768 --> 02:09:57,463
Quickly, quickly.
- Yes, there.

1718
02:09:58,738 --> 02:10:00,000
Quickly.

1719
02:10:00,073 --> 02:10:02,007
Hurry up.
- Fast.

1720
02:10:49,856 --> 02:10:50,704
Here's your share.

1721
02:10:50,705 --> 02:10:51,881
- Madam, a little more.

1722
02:10:51,958 --> 02:10:53,482
Get lost.
- I worked so hard.

1723
02:10:53,559 --> 02:10:54,492
I will break your face.

1724
02:10:54,493 --> 02:10:55,424
You were over-acting.

1725
02:10:55,528 --> 02:10:56,825
I was paid less for the ACP's role as well.

1726
02:10:56,929 --> 02:10:58,692
I'm being paid less here too.
- Get lost.

1727
02:11:05,171 --> 02:11:06,399
Take care.

1728
02:11:15,815 --> 02:11:16,975
We'll meet again soon.

1729
02:11:17,083 --> 02:11:18,414
See you.
- Soon.

1730
02:11:40,773 --> 02:11:42,365
Come here.

1731
02:11:46,179 --> 02:11:47,373
You...

1732
02:11:48,081 --> 02:11:49,309
CBI!

1733
02:11:49,615 --> 02:11:51,082
Oh God!

1734
02:11:52,251 --> 02:11:53,684
Here to conduct a raid?

1735
02:11:55,288 --> 02:11:56,414
Quiet!

1736
02:11:56,956 --> 02:11:58,947
If you're here to conduct a raid, then go ahead.

1737
02:11:59,292 --> 02:12:00,691
What are you doing inside?

1738
02:12:02,361 --> 02:12:04,226
Waiting for the boss.

1739
02:12:04,831 --> 02:12:06,162
Where's the boss?

1740
02:12:06,766 --> 02:12:09,200
He's on the way.

1741
02:12:09,402 --> 02:12:10,801
Get lost.

1742
02:12:19,278 --> 02:12:20,540
Hurry up.

1743
02:12:20,947 --> 02:12:22,414
How much longer.

1744
02:12:24,584 --> 02:12:25,846
Got it.

1745
02:12:33,359 --> 02:12:34,519
Hello.

1746
02:12:34,594 --> 02:12:35,822
Yes.

1747
02:12:36,262 --> 02:12:37,422
What?

1748
02:12:38,564 --> 02:12:39,929
What are you saying?

1749
02:12:41,768 --> 02:12:43,030
Sir.

1750
02:12:43,136 --> 02:12:44,433
Sir.

1751
02:12:44,537 --> 02:12:47,938
Sir, the CBI raided Magandas's workshop.

1752
02:12:48,474 --> 02:12:50,305
What?
- Yes, sir.

1753
02:12:50,543 --> 02:12:52,033
We just received a call.

1754
02:12:55,515 --> 02:12:57,642
CBI?
- Yes, sir.

1755
02:12:59,418 --> 02:13:01,682
The workshop?
- Yes, sir.

1756
02:13:21,407 --> 02:13:23,272
'He was humiliated.'

1757
02:13:23,776 --> 02:13:26,267
'He conducted an investigation... '

1758
02:13:26,479 --> 02:13:28,208
'... and gathered this information.'

1759
02:13:28,281 --> 02:13:30,408
'Why is he standing? Let him sit.'

1760
02:13:30,483 --> 02:13:32,348
'No, sir. I am fine.
- Come on.'

1761
02:13:33,653 --> 02:13:35,917
'They made a fool of you, Ranveer.'

1762
02:13:35,988 --> 02:13:38,616
'I came here because I needed your help.'

1763
02:13:38,791 --> 02:13:41,589
'Lf you help me, this case will be solved faster.'

1764
02:13:42,361 --> 02:13:44,591
'I'll have to admit one thing.'

1765
02:13:44,831 --> 02:13:48,358
'There are just four of you, but you've spread chaos.'

1766
02:13:48,668 --> 02:13:50,465
'Not four.'

1767
02:13:52,038 --> 02:13:55,405
'People like them help us as well.'

1768
02:14:04,317 --> 02:14:06,285
How wonderful.

1769
02:14:08,721 --> 02:14:10,586
Just remembered.

1770
02:14:11,557 --> 02:14:15,550
'Ajju always used to say,
there's no one who can catch him.'

1771
02:14:17,496 --> 02:14:19,521
Solanki, come here.

1772
02:14:20,132 --> 02:14:22,828
Yes, sir.
- How many people in our team?

1773
02:14:23,269 --> 02:14:27,171
Sir, counting you, me, Rahul and Ranveer around 27.

1774
02:14:27,640 --> 02:14:30,370
Ranveer isn't a police officer, Solanki.

1775
02:14:30,843 --> 02:14:33,209
Ranveer was Ajju's aide...

1776
02:14:33,279 --> 02:14:35,543
...who came to our office posing as a police officer.

1777
02:14:35,648 --> 02:14:38,048
And we believed him.

1778
02:14:40,720 --> 02:14:41,778
'Jai Hind.
- Who's this? '

1779
02:14:41,888 --> 02:14:45,346
Ranveer, Shanti, they are all fake.

1780
02:14:46,092 --> 02:14:47,559
You, along with four junior constables...

1781
02:14:47,627 --> 02:14:49,492
...and one female constable will be enough.

1782
02:14:49,562 --> 02:14:50,955
We'll meet at Safdurjung in 15 minutes.

1783
02:14:50,956 --> 02:14:51,826
- They were all in this.

1784
02:14:56,636 --> 02:15:00,231
They... they are all fake!

1785
02:15:13,152 --> 02:15:15,017
'Are you sure?
- 100%.'

1786
02:15:17,390 --> 02:15:21,793
We didn't know, but we were playing for their team.

1787
02:15:26,899 --> 02:15:30,266
We're Special 26, Solanki.

1788
02:15:32,672 --> 02:15:35,368
The rascals didn't just rob the shop...

1789
02:15:36,842 --> 02:15:38,867
...but also the workshop.

1790
02:15:43,049 --> 02:15:44,539
Solanki.

1791
02:15:45,217 --> 02:15:46,514
Yes, sir.

1792
02:15:48,521 --> 02:15:51,115
Where can I find a handful of water?

1793
02:15:52,358 --> 02:15:53,655
What, sir?

1794
02:15:54,560 --> 02:15:55,891
Water.

1795
02:15:57,730 --> 02:15:58,958
Handful of water.

1796
02:16:25,791 --> 02:16:37,259
You'll find me everywhere I go, I know that.

1797
02:16:38,337 --> 02:16:49,509
I now belong to you, since I know, that's your influence.

1798
02:16:50,182 --> 02:16:54,243
I close to you, in your feelings.

1799
02:16:54,320 --> 02:16:58,120
In your memories.

1800
02:16:58,491 --> 02:17:06,796
Now you dwell in me.

1801
02:17:07,400 --> 02:17:09,834
Who are you?

1802
02:17:10,336 --> 02:17:14,238
How are we related?

1803
02:17:15,708 --> 02:17:23,012
What's this bond that binds us?

1804
02:17:24,016 --> 02:17:31,616
I can't control myself before you.

1805
02:17:32,358 --> 02:17:35,020
Who are you?

1806
02:17:35,261 --> 02:17:39,493
How are we related?

1807
02:17:55,815 --> 02:17:57,471
We're here.
Stop, stop, stop.

1808
02:17:57,472 --> 02:17:58,613
- The bus is here.

1809
02:17:59,685 --> 02:18:00,982
Thank you.
- Come, son.

1810
02:18:01,087 --> 02:18:02,782
Thank you. Very good.

1811
02:18:03,422 --> 02:18:04,787
Bye.
- Let's go.

1812
02:18:04,890 --> 02:18:06,721
Bye, dad.
- Go.

1813
02:18:12,932 --> 02:18:14,627
Waseem sir.

1814
02:18:14,900 --> 02:18:16,595
There's a money-order for you.

1815
02:18:16,669 --> 02:18:18,569
Money-order?
From where?

1816
02:18:20,039 --> 02:18:23,440
Laxmipur, Bhojpur, District Bihar.

1817
02:18:23,509 --> 02:18:24,755
What?
How much?

1818
02:18:24,756 --> 02:18:26,000
- 100 rupees.

1819
02:18:26,112 --> 02:18:28,046
And yes, there's a message as well.

1820
02:18:28,114 --> 02:18:29,308
See.

1821
02:18:29,415 --> 02:18:32,248
Waseem sir, I wanted to return it personally...

1822
02:18:32,318 --> 02:18:33,979
...but I am helpless.

1823
02:18:34,553 --> 02:18:37,852
Your hard-earned money is no use to me.

1824
02:18:37,923 --> 02:18:39,788
Yours, Ajju.

1825
02:18:40,059 --> 02:18:41,356
'It's yours, isn't it? '

1826
02:18:41,727 --> 02:18:42,955
'Yes, it is.'

1827
02:18:43,295 --> 02:18:44,489
'Thank you.'

1828
02:18:45,764 --> 02:18:46,958
Here you go.

1829
02:19:02,348 --> 02:19:03,901
We were about to miss the bus...

1830
02:19:03,902 --> 02:19:04,748
- Rahul's called.

1831
02:19:14,126 --> 02:19:14,746
Yes, Rahul.

1832
02:19:14,747 --> 02:19:16,890
- Sir, we've information about them.

1833
02:19:34,480 --> 02:19:37,074
Couple of years ago, maybe three years ago.

1834
02:19:37,149 --> 02:19:39,515
One would have never associated him with a shot like this.

1835
02:19:39,618 --> 02:19:42,485
But I think he has come to learn and life...

1836
02:19:42,588 --> 02:19:48,083
...in one day cricket and has played some really good shots.

1837
02:19:50,029 --> 02:19:51,291
Shot!

1838
02:19:52,598 --> 02:19:53,895
Six!

1839
02:19:59,004 --> 02:20:01,097
Once more, he has to do it.

1840
02:20:20,526 --> 02:20:22,535
In the youth, was on the streets.

1841
02:20:22,536 --> 02:20:24,189
Half the world are sinners.

1842
02:20:24,263 --> 02:20:26,831
Who is original, all is a copy.

1843
02:20:26,832 --> 02:20:28,597
Whole life is hectic.

1844
02:20:31,637 --> 02:20:33,150
His neck, his legs.

1845
02:20:33,151 --> 02:20:35,300
His loin cloth, her veil.

1846
02:20:35,407 --> 02:20:38,968
His finger, his hair, hold it and get your work done.

1847
02:20:39,078 --> 02:20:42,514
Don't be over confident, life is catch and hold.

1848
02:20:42,581 --> 02:20:46,176
Catch and hold.

1849
02:20:46,252 --> 02:20:50,018
Catch and hold.

1850
02:20:50,089 --> 02:20:51,735
Catch the thief by his tail.

1851
02:20:51,736 --> 02:20:53,616
Everything is related to food.

1852
02:20:53,726 --> 02:20:58,186
Police and thieves, cat and mouse,
whether it is Mumbai, Patna or Delhi.

1853
02:21:01,133 --> 02:21:02,897
Everyone is playing catch.

1854
02:21:02,898 --> 02:21:04,796
But money has a good hold.

1855
02:21:04,870 --> 02:21:09,068
The world is an animal, money leads this animal.

1856
02:21:12,044 --> 02:21:14,167
The money should come any how.

1857
02:21:14,168 --> 02:21:15,810
Whether white or black.

1858
02:21:15,881 --> 02:21:19,510
Everyone is running after this money.

1859
02:21:23,255 --> 02:21:25,246
There is a lot of attitude with this.

1860
02:21:25,247 --> 02:21:26,713
If its black then catch it.

1861
02:21:26,792 --> 02:21:29,693
Catch and hold.

1862
02:21:29,762 --> 02:21:33,163
Catch and hold.

1863
02:21:33,265 --> 02:21:37,099
Catch and hold.

1864
02:21:37,169 --> 02:21:40,696
Youth is stuck in the yes or no of love.

1865
02:21:40,773 --> 02:21:43,503
If she says yes, then movie and coffee.

1866
02:21:43,575 --> 02:21:45,509
If she says no, then sister, forgive me.

1867
02:21:48,147 --> 02:21:51,810
The world comes in between, but love continues.

1868
02:21:51,917 --> 02:21:56,650
Whether you have sense or no, still it continues.

1869
02:21:59,325 --> 02:22:02,886
Catch the one on the way.

1870
02:22:02,961 --> 02:22:06,658
Catch and hold.

1871
02:22:06,732 --> 02:22:10,133
Catch and hold.

1872
02:22:10,202 --> 02:22:14,036
Catch and hold.

1873
02:22:14,106 --> 02:22:17,701
Catch and hold.

1874
02:22:17,776 --> 02:22:22,145
Catch and hold.

1875
02:22:23,315 --> 02:22:24,577
Catch and hold.
