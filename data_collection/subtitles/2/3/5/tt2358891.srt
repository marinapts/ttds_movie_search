1
00:00:47,661 --> 00:00:49,219
Travel is useful,
it exercises the imagination.

2
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:51,297
All the rest
is disappointment and fatigue.

3
00:00:51,421 --> 00:00:54,060
Our journey is entirely imaginary.
That is its strength.

4
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:55,933
lt goes from life to death.

5
00:00:56,061 --> 00:00:58,336
People, animals, cities, things,
all are imagined.

6
00:00:58,461 --> 00:00:59,780
lt's a novel,
just a fictitious narrative.

7
00:00:59,901 --> 00:01:02,620
Littre says so, and he's never wrong.
And besides, anyone can do as much.

8
00:01:02,741 --> 00:01:05,574
You just have to close your eyes.
lt's on the other side of life.

9
00:01:05,701 --> 00:01:07,851
Louis-Ferdinand Celine
Journey to the End of the Night

10
00:01:12,021 --> 00:01:13,454
Fire!

11
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:37,173
You're a real pain in the ass!

12
00:04:37,981 --> 00:04:39,334
Enough!

13
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:42,294
They even have cocktails
with cherries. Remember?

14
00:04:42,421 --> 00:04:44,776
Hey, jerks!

15
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:46,454
l'll screw you!

16
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:48,890
l'll screw you!

17
00:05:06,621 --> 00:05:08,418
Have you seen Ermanno?

18
00:06:02,181 --> 00:06:05,491
- l'll screw you! Now!
- Get lost!

19
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:42,490
What the hell are you doing?

20
00:07:15,421 --> 00:07:17,173
My phone's been stolen!

21
00:08:01,221 --> 00:08:03,291
l'm starring in two TV dramas...

22
00:08:03,501 --> 00:08:05,457
l'm playing a Pope in one,

23
00:08:05,621 --> 00:08:08,693
and a junkie on the road to recovery
in the other.

24
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:12,530
lmpressive!
No theatre work?

25
00:08:12,661 --> 00:08:15,733
l'm supposed to do
Shakespeare with Pietro, but...

26
00:08:15,941 --> 00:08:17,897
it has to be at least
three hours long,

27
00:08:18,061 --> 00:08:22,691
be an ambitious project,
and no more small cities!

28
00:08:23,021 --> 00:08:26,855
l'm trying to write a piece
for theatre, and the concept is...

29
00:08:26,981 --> 00:08:30,940
- What about you?
- l might give up acting.

30
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:34,332
ln this shitty country there are
never any good female roles.

31
00:08:34,501 --> 00:08:37,459
l'll write my first novel,
a Proust-style piece.

32
00:08:37,581 --> 00:08:40,254
Really?
Proust is my favourite writer!

33
00:08:40,381 --> 00:08:42,497
Along with Ammaniti...

34
00:08:43,421 --> 00:08:44,900
What a coincidence.

35
00:08:52,581 --> 00:08:54,014
Who is that woman?

36
00:08:54,181 --> 00:08:56,217
Don't you recognise her?
lt's Lorena.

37
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:57,735
Who?

38
00:08:57,861 --> 00:09:01,934
An ex TV showgirl, now in
full physical and mental decline.

39
00:09:02,061 --> 00:09:06,100
Never seen her! But then
l've never had a television.

40
00:09:06,221 --> 00:09:10,692
Viola, l know you don't have one.
You tell me all the time.

41
00:09:10,861 --> 00:09:13,500
- What does she do now?
- Nothing, of course.

42
00:09:15,461 --> 00:09:16,974
Happy birthday, Jep!

43
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:19,291
Happy birthday, Rome!

44
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:06,020
La Colita!

45
00:11:25,181 --> 00:11:28,378
To this question, as kids,

46
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:31,857
my friends always gave
the same answer...

47
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:34,093
''pussy''.

48
00:11:34,621 --> 00:11:36,339
Whereas l answered...

49
00:11:36,941 --> 00:11:39,250
''the smell of old
people's houses''.

50
00:11:39,981 --> 00:11:41,653
The question was:

51
00:11:41,781 --> 00:11:46,332
''What do you like most, really,
in life?''

52
00:11:47,341 --> 00:11:50,492
l was destined for sensibility.

53
00:11:51,141 --> 00:11:54,656
l was destined to become a writer.

54
00:11:55,101 --> 00:12:00,016
l was destined to become
Jep Gambardella.

55
00:12:09,621 --> 00:12:11,737
You paid no attention
to me tonight!

56
00:12:11,941 --> 00:12:15,490
Romano, don't start moaning,
we're not an item.

57
00:12:16,061 --> 00:12:18,655
- You liked that guy?
- l like everyone and no one.

58
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:21,659
But l wonder why you're always
with me when it's no one's turn.

59
00:12:21,781 --> 00:12:25,456
- Will you take me to the airport?
- Sure. What time are you leaving?

60
00:12:26,941 --> 00:12:28,738
- ln three hours.
- Three hours?

61
00:12:30,341 --> 00:12:33,014
Then l should crash on your sofa...

62
00:12:33,141 --> 00:12:37,373
Go home, l need to pack
and l don't want anyone around.

63
00:12:37,501 --> 00:12:40,413
- But l live miles away.
- See you at 8:00.

64
00:12:47,581 --> 00:12:49,412
Goodnight.

65
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,418
Guys?

66
00:13:20,981 --> 00:13:22,858
Guys?

67
00:13:38,941 --> 00:13:40,454
Children!

68
00:14:08,141 --> 00:14:09,654
Run along!

69
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:09,133
Catellani?

70
00:15:11,181 --> 00:15:12,660
The best, of course.

71
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:18,337
Did Catellani the tailor
make your suit?

72
00:16:08,181 --> 00:16:11,059
There was no doubt
about Malagna's shady intentions.

73
00:16:11,181 --> 00:16:15,652
The girl should be rescued
at any cost, without loss of time.

74
00:16:16,381 --> 00:16:17,814
Sir, you drank!

75
00:16:17,941 --> 00:16:20,057
Just enough to forget
my birthday.

76
00:16:20,701 --> 00:16:22,976
- You want infusion?
- Heavens, no!

77
00:16:25,501 --> 00:16:27,093
- l got you a present.
- How sweet!

78
00:16:27,221 --> 00:16:29,940
This is a lucky charm
from my country.

79
00:16:32,421 --> 00:16:35,618
Good thing it's lucky,
because it's pretty ugly.

80
00:16:35,741 --> 00:16:38,460
Keep it on your bedside
and stop complaining!

81
00:16:38,661 --> 00:16:42,336
l will! And thanks.
Wake me up at 15:00, you rascal.

82
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:45,212
You're funny when you call me that!

83
00:20:01,421 --> 00:20:03,616
l don't love you!

84
00:20:07,301 --> 00:20:09,019
Brilliant!

85
00:20:17,941 --> 00:20:19,135
Did you enjoy the performance?

86
00:20:22,061 --> 00:20:23,779
Parts of it.

87
00:20:23,901 --> 00:20:26,415
That violent head-butt
made me understand many things.

88
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,497
- Let's start from the beginning.
- Or the end?

89
00:20:29,181 --> 00:20:31,376
You know, Talia Concept
loves to provoke.

90
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:35,011
Don't bother, there are more
important things than provoking me.

91
00:20:35,181 --> 00:20:38,856
And this habit of speaking
in the third person is unbearable.

92
00:20:39,021 --> 00:20:40,374
What are you reading?

93
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:43,897
l don't need to read, l live
on vibrations, extra-sensory ones.

94
00:20:44,021 --> 00:20:49,971
Extra-sensoriality aside,
what do you mean by vibrations?

95
00:20:50,141 --> 00:20:52,496
The poetry of vibrations cannot
be described

96
00:20:52,621 --> 00:20:55,260
with the vulgarity of words.

97
00:20:55,941 --> 00:20:58,057
Well, try at least.

98
00:20:58,221 --> 00:21:00,177
l'm an artist,
l don't need to explain jack shit.

99
00:21:00,381 --> 00:21:04,897
So l'll write: ''Lives on vibrations,
but she doesn't know what they are.''

100
00:21:05,141 --> 00:21:07,177
l'm starting to dislike
this interview,

101
00:21:07,301 --> 00:21:09,212
l sense conflictuality in you.

102
00:21:09,381 --> 00:21:12,657
- Conflictuality as a vibration?
- As a pain in the ass.

103
00:21:12,821 --> 00:21:15,494
Let's talk about my mom's
abusive boyfriend.

104
00:21:15,701 --> 00:21:19,171
No! l want to know
what a vibration is.

105
00:21:22,341 --> 00:21:24,650
lt's my radar to intercept
the world.

106
00:21:24,821 --> 00:21:26,812
Your radar... meaning?

107
00:21:27,861 --> 00:21:29,852
You're a pain in the ass.

108
00:21:29,981 --> 00:21:31,937
We got off to a bad start...

109
00:21:32,061 --> 00:21:34,814
Talia Concept wants to be
interviewed by your paper,

110
00:21:34,941 --> 00:21:37,774
it has many readers.
But you're biased.

111
00:21:37,901 --> 00:21:41,610
Write about how she has sex
with her fiance 11 times a day,

112
00:21:41,741 --> 00:21:43,538
he's a talented conceptual artist,

113
00:21:43,661 --> 00:21:46,698
he covers basketballs with confetti!
He's sensational!

114
00:21:46,821 --> 00:21:50,018
Talia Concept is talking about
things that are meaningless to me.

115
00:21:50,141 --> 00:21:52,496
All l've heard
is unpublishable fluff.

116
00:21:52,661 --> 00:21:55,016
You can't charm me
with things like:

117
00:21:55,141 --> 00:21:57,894
''l'm an artist,
l don't need to explain''.

118
00:21:58,021 --> 00:22:00,489
Our paper has a core
of cultured readers

119
00:22:00,661 --> 00:22:03,129
that don't want to be taken
for fools. l work for that core.

120
00:22:03,261 --> 00:22:05,821
So let me talk about my eventful,

121
00:22:05,981 --> 00:22:08,654
difficult but necessary
journey as an artist!

122
00:22:08,781 --> 00:22:10,419
Necessary for who?

123
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:13,692
For heaven's sake, madam,
what is a vibration?

124
00:22:15,621 --> 00:22:18,419
- l don't know.
- You don't know.

125
00:22:18,581 --> 00:22:20,936
You are an obsessive jerk!

126
00:22:21,061 --> 00:22:24,770
l'll tell your editor to send me
a journalist of a higher stature.

127
00:22:24,901 --> 00:22:28,018
A piece of advice:
when you speak to my editor,

128
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:31,810
go easy on the stature business.
She's a dwarf, you know.

129
00:22:33,461 --> 00:22:36,180
Jep, this interview is a hoot!

130
00:22:36,341 --> 00:22:38,377
Maybe, but don't send me

131
00:22:38,501 --> 00:22:40,253
to interview someone
who head-butts walls again.

132
00:22:41,381 --> 00:22:44,293
- You know what the trick is?
- Foam rubber.

133
00:22:44,461 --> 00:22:46,019
Amateur dramatics isn't dead.

134
00:22:46,181 --> 00:22:50,254
Did you get offended
about the stature comment?

135
00:22:50,421 --> 00:22:53,891
Don't be silly!
That's the funniest bit!

136
00:22:54,061 --> 00:22:56,211
l'm a dwarf, it's no secret.

137
00:22:56,381 --> 00:22:59,259
lt's the first and last thing
everyone says about me.

138
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:02,777
You're a spectacular woman, Dadina.
You've had the career you deserve.

139
00:23:02,941 --> 00:23:06,297
But you haven't had the career
you deserve.

140
00:23:06,901 --> 00:23:08,892
Maybe l don't have much to say...

141
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:12,616
Bullshit, you're lazy.
You never leave Rome.

142
00:23:12,781 --> 00:23:15,341
Go to Giglio to do that report
on the Concordia

143
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:17,179
l've asked you to do 50 times.

144
00:23:21,581 --> 00:23:24,891
Re-heated rice is always tastier
than freshly cooked rice.

145
00:23:25,061 --> 00:23:27,370
The old is better than the new.

146
00:23:28,181 --> 00:23:29,933
Plans tonight, cherie?

147
00:23:30,101 --> 00:23:33,650
As the great De Blasi,
my predecessor, said:

148
00:23:33,821 --> 00:23:37,496
''Tonight l'll do two things,
eat soup and have a shag.''

149
00:23:37,661 --> 00:23:39,970
Two things that contradict
each other.

150
00:23:40,141 --> 00:23:43,099
That's what l'd say too,
and she'd reply, in a serious tone:

151
00:23:43,261 --> 00:23:47,379
''No, Dadina, they don't,
because they're both hot.''

152
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:52,892
There's a publishing house
in Ancona, it's not that small,

153
00:23:53,101 --> 00:23:55,057
they want an interview book
about you.

154
00:23:55,181 --> 00:23:59,060
Another interview book?
We're obsessed with interviews!

155
00:23:59,181 --> 00:24:02,298
Can't you hear them?
''As l always say''... to who?

156
00:24:02,461 --> 00:24:03,860
Forget it!

157
00:24:03,981 --> 00:24:06,575
And honestly,
who'll buy a book called:

158
00:24:06,701 --> 00:24:09,773
''Visions and revisions.
Jep Gambardella's Galaxy''?

159
00:24:09,941 --> 00:24:11,693
lt's a serious title!

160
00:24:11,861 --> 00:24:14,580
Unfortunately in this country,
in order to be taken seriously,

161
00:24:14,741 --> 00:24:16,811
you have to take yourself seriously.

162
00:24:16,981 --> 00:24:21,293
l only wrote one novel, 40 years ago.
lmpossible to find too...

163
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:24,294
Bullshit, ''The Human Apparatus''
was a masterpiece!

164
00:24:24,461 --> 00:24:26,372
lt even won the... what was it?

165
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:29,101
- The Bancarella prize.
- Shit, the Bancarella prize!

166
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:32,571
You're very kind, but forget it...
it'd be too pompous.

167
00:24:32,701 --> 00:24:36,091
l can't, you'll put me
in an awkward position.

168
00:24:36,301 --> 00:24:39,373
l've agreed and l've even accepted
an advance...

169
00:24:39,501 --> 00:24:40,934
- How much?
- 1,500 euros.

170
00:24:41,141 --> 00:24:43,575
Give it back,
l'll give you 1,500 euros.

171
00:24:43,741 --> 00:24:46,892
By the way,
l spoke to the theatre people.

172
00:24:47,021 --> 00:24:50,093
They'll give you three nights
but you pay for the lights.

173
00:24:50,261 --> 00:24:52,013
Who cares about that!

174
00:24:52,181 --> 00:24:54,137
Jep, this is great news.

175
00:24:54,541 --> 00:24:57,214
lt's really great news.
Thank you!

176
00:25:03,141 --> 00:25:06,770
Are you still up?
lt's time to go to bed.

177
00:25:06,941 --> 00:25:08,932
That's Viola Bartoli,
Bartoli's widow.

178
00:25:09,061 --> 00:25:11,621
The guy who was killed,
the actual Bartoli.

179
00:25:11,821 --> 00:25:15,894
Viola has a 50 metre yacht
that belonged to Himmler, the Nazi.

180
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,137
You know what l call Viola?

181
00:25:18,301 --> 00:25:20,815
- No, what?
- ''To-good-to-poo''.

182
00:25:20,981 --> 00:25:24,451
- l don't understand.
- Because she's pernickety.

183
00:25:24,581 --> 00:25:26,890
Usually pernickety people don't poo.

184
00:25:27,061 --> 00:25:30,098
When l introduced Trumeau
to my family, my father said:

185
00:25:30,221 --> 00:25:33,691
''Miss, before marrying my son,
have you ever seen him poo?''

186
00:25:33,901 --> 00:25:36,176
- How gross!
- lt's not as bad as you think.

187
00:25:36,341 --> 00:25:40,812
Actually, my wife and l are the only
couple in ltaly who are in love.

188
00:25:40,941 --> 00:25:42,897
Orietta, watch out for Lello.

189
00:25:43,061 --> 00:25:44,619
Yes, l know.

190
00:25:44,741 --> 00:25:47,539
He's the world's greatest salesman,
he cons everyone.

191
00:25:47,661 --> 00:25:49,538
ln no time he'll get you to spend
every penny

192
00:25:49,661 --> 00:25:50,776
on whatever he's selling.

193
00:25:50,941 --> 00:25:52,215
You always flatter me.

194
00:25:52,381 --> 00:25:56,010
Just because l express myself well
doesn't mean l'm always working!

195
00:25:56,141 --> 00:25:58,132
- What do you do?
- l sell toys.

196
00:25:58,301 --> 00:26:00,132
Not just in a shop,

197
00:26:00,301 --> 00:26:03,657
he's a wholesaler on a global scale,
he even sells to the Chinese!

198
00:26:03,781 --> 00:26:05,009
What about him?

199
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:09,299
Don't you know him? Sebastiano Paf,
perhaps ltaly's greatest poet.

200
00:26:09,461 --> 00:26:14,774
He wrote: ''Up with life,
down with reminiscence.''

201
00:26:15,701 --> 00:26:18,454
He's on the Dukan Diet,
so Dadina won't leave him.

202
00:26:18,781 --> 00:26:19,611
ls he with her?

203
00:26:19,741 --> 00:26:22,460
- He is, but she...
- Like at high school.

204
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:25,338
Why doesn't he ever talk?

205
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:27,457
Because he listens.

206
00:26:29,461 --> 00:26:32,578
- Stop sniffing up with your nose?
- Bugger off.

207
00:26:32,701 --> 00:26:37,092
Jep's found a theatre for me.
Do you want the lead role?

208
00:26:37,261 --> 00:26:40,139
l'm no longer an actress,
l'm a writer now.

209
00:26:40,381 --> 00:26:42,133
Maybe...

210
00:26:42,941 --> 00:26:44,852
Maybe l'll direct a film.

211
00:26:45,021 --> 00:26:48,934
- Viola, darling!
- Help me, l'm worried about my son.

212
00:26:49,101 --> 00:26:52,013
- What can l do?
- Why don't you talk to him?

213
00:26:52,141 --> 00:26:54,530
You always say you're good
with strangers...

214
00:26:54,661 --> 00:26:56,617
That's the problem, l'm too good.

215
00:26:56,781 --> 00:27:01,013
- ls he seeing a therapist?
- Yes, but he wants to stop going.

216
00:27:01,181 --> 00:27:05,618
Take him to a psychiatrist, they're
pragmatic: Ativan, Prozac and so on.

217
00:27:05,781 --> 00:27:07,533
That stuff makes him feel worse.

218
00:27:07,701 --> 00:27:11,250
Relax, he's always been odd,
he is what he is.

219
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:14,453
By the way, have you tried
this rascal's endive quiche?

220
00:27:14,621 --> 00:27:18,091
lt's the first time she's made it
and it's better than my mom's,

221
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:21,571
please, you must try some!

222
00:27:26,981 --> 00:27:28,778
You changed your hair colour.

223
00:27:30,101 --> 00:27:32,774
l feel Pirandello-esque lately...

224
00:27:34,301 --> 00:27:37,134
- Great jazz, no?
- Not really.

225
00:27:37,261 --> 00:27:41,732
The Ethiopian jazz scene is the only
interesting one today.

226
00:27:41,901 --> 00:27:45,098
l'm from Milan, to be honest...
l find Romans...

227
00:27:45,621 --> 00:27:46,770
unbearable!

228
00:27:46,941 --> 00:27:49,580
The best people in Rome
are the tourists.

229
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:51,100
Take ltaly...

230
00:27:51,261 --> 00:27:54,537
What are we famous for overseas?
Fashion and pizza.

231
00:27:54,701 --> 00:27:57,090
A country of weavers and grocers.

232
00:27:57,261 --> 00:28:01,140
How can someone who sells toys,
bringing joy to the world,

233
00:28:01,261 --> 00:28:04,378
be such a pessimist
and a defeatist? You're dark.

234
00:28:04,541 --> 00:28:06,099
- Dark?
- Yes.

235
00:28:06,261 --> 00:28:08,980
l heard Gisella Montanelli
went to loans sharks

236
00:28:09,141 --> 00:28:10,813
to pay her hairdressing debts.

237
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:12,573
Jep says l'm dark!

238
00:28:12,741 --> 00:28:14,254
Gisella's really sunk that low?

239
00:28:14,381 --> 00:28:19,409
Rome is the only city in the world
where Marxism has truly existed.

240
00:28:19,581 --> 00:28:22,459
You can't excel over others
for more than a week,

241
00:28:22,621 --> 00:28:25,738
you're immediately brought back
to mediocrity.

242
00:28:25,861 --> 00:28:28,978
Rome is pure collectivism.

243
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:32,372
Pure collectivism.
Stefania, what utter nonsense!

244
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:35,817
Do you know that Flaubert wanted
to write a book about nothing?

245
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:39,212
lf he'd met you, we'd have had
a great book, what a shame!

246
00:28:40,421 --> 00:28:41,979
You're a misogynist.

247
00:28:42,141 --> 00:28:46,054
lt's not all about you, l'm not
a misogynist, l'm a misanthropist.

248
00:28:46,221 --> 00:28:48,337
When hate's involved,
one must aim high.

249
00:28:48,501 --> 00:28:51,334
You're a dark man.

250
00:28:51,501 --> 00:28:53,776
l'm a transparent person,
without a doubt!

251
00:29:40,981 --> 00:29:42,619
Lello!

252
00:29:42,901 --> 00:29:44,619
Aren't you stopping tonight?

253
00:29:57,581 --> 00:30:00,015
Mom!
When l see you l blush!

254
00:30:01,101 --> 00:30:02,693
Andrea...

255
00:30:03,861 --> 00:30:06,455
- You're crazy.
- No, mom, l'm not crazy!

256
00:30:07,821 --> 00:30:09,539
l've got problems.

257
00:30:10,901 --> 00:30:13,973
''As the light flashed,
love sat down in the corner.

258
00:30:14,141 --> 00:30:16,860
Shy and distracted as it was.

259
00:30:17,021 --> 00:30:19,979
This is why
we could tolerate life no longer.''

260
00:30:20,101 --> 00:30:22,854
Gosh,
no one's quoted me for years!

261
00:30:22,981 --> 00:30:25,779
l read your book as a teenager,
l've never forgotten the end.

262
00:30:25,941 --> 00:30:30,014
Stop right there, you're stroking
my ego in a dangerous way.

263
00:30:30,141 --> 00:30:34,771
You must've been deeply in love
when you wrote it.

264
00:30:37,421 --> 00:30:40,140
Moravia made the same comment,
more or less.

265
00:30:40,261 --> 00:30:43,537
Even though he worded it
a bit better.

266
00:30:44,981 --> 00:30:47,654
l once saw Piazza Navona
covered in snow.

267
00:30:47,861 --> 00:30:50,136
Really? What was it like?

268
00:30:50,941 --> 00:30:52,659
White!

269
00:30:54,941 --> 00:30:57,011
When l come to Rome l live there.

270
00:30:57,581 --> 00:30:59,492
Deep in the outskirts...

271
00:31:01,181 --> 00:31:02,853
What job you do?

272
00:31:03,021 --> 00:31:05,137
Me? l'm rich.

273
00:31:05,261 --> 00:31:07,217
Great job.

274
00:31:33,261 --> 00:31:35,013
You didn't enjoy it.

275
00:31:35,301 --> 00:31:37,496
l know l'm not very good.

276
00:31:37,661 --> 00:31:39,413
Why do you say that?

277
00:31:39,901 --> 00:31:44,850
Plus it's so sad being good,
you risk becoming deft.

278
00:31:45,861 --> 00:31:47,977
lt didn't seem like you cared much.

279
00:31:50,261 --> 00:31:53,571
You're very beautiful, Orietta,
very, very, very beautiful.

280
00:31:53,701 --> 00:31:56,454
l take photos, you know.
Of myself.

281
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,493
At all times of the day,
to get to know myself.

282
00:31:59,661 --> 00:32:03,176
- With the self-timer,
with my phone... - lnteresting.

283
00:32:03,341 --> 00:32:06,572
My Facebook friends say
l take great photos.

284
00:32:06,741 --> 00:32:09,209
l bet there are some of you naked...

285
00:32:10,741 --> 00:32:13,130
- A few.
- l knew it!

286
00:32:13,301 --> 00:32:15,735
Do you want to see them?

287
00:32:15,861 --> 00:32:18,659
- Of course.
- l'll get my computer.

288
00:32:30,861 --> 00:32:36,777
The most important thing l discovered
a few days after turning 65

289
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:41,659
is that l can't waste any more time
doing things l don't want to do.

290
00:33:09,581 --> 00:33:14,052
When l came to Rome,
at the age of 26,

291
00:33:14,181 --> 00:33:20,177
l fell pretty swiftly,
almost without realising it,

292
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:25,171
into what might be defined
as the whirlpool of the high life.

293
00:33:25,821 --> 00:33:31,339
But l didn't just want to live
the high life.

294
00:33:31,861 --> 00:33:33,613
Sacconi should be in charge.

295
00:33:33,781 --> 00:33:36,534
Antonini's a fucking pain
in the ass!

296
00:33:39,341 --> 00:33:43,220
l wanted to be
the king of the high life.

297
00:33:43,581 --> 00:33:45,890
And l succeeded.

298
00:33:50,581 --> 00:33:54,938
l didn't just want
to go to parties.

299
00:33:57,021 --> 00:34:01,094
l wanted to have
the power to make them a failure.

300
00:34:29,061 --> 00:34:30,335
Gambardella?

301
00:34:31,581 --> 00:34:35,051
Sorry for showing up like this,
without warning...

302
00:34:35,621 --> 00:34:37,532
l'm Alfredo Marti.

303
00:34:37,741 --> 00:34:40,778
Nice to meet you, l'm Jep,
but my house is this one.

304
00:34:40,981 --> 00:34:42,937
l don't want to bother you.

305
00:34:44,421 --> 00:34:46,139
How can l help you?

306
00:34:46,741 --> 00:34:48,857
l'm Elisa De Santis' husband.

307
00:34:55,021 --> 00:34:56,932
Did you have children?

308
00:34:57,101 --> 00:34:58,693
No.

309
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:01,251
l couldn't.

310
00:35:02,261 --> 00:35:03,979
But l could.

311
00:35:06,261 --> 00:35:07,660
l could.

312
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:11,054
l'm sorry.

313
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:13,453
Forgive me.

314
00:35:14,421 --> 00:35:16,855
She could too.

315
00:35:17,981 --> 00:35:19,937
Elisa died.

316
00:35:21,261 --> 00:35:22,899
Yesterday.

317
00:35:50,301 --> 00:35:53,338
Alfredo, if you need anything,
you know where l live.

318
00:36:01,101 --> 00:36:04,093
Don't leave me alone, please.
Don't leave me.

319
00:36:14,661 --> 00:36:17,380
We were married for 35 years...

320
00:36:17,541 --> 00:36:20,101
but Elisa always loved you.

321
00:36:25,021 --> 00:36:27,012
What are you saying?

322
00:36:27,741 --> 00:36:30,653
Elisa and l went out together
when we were kids.

323
00:36:31,741 --> 00:36:35,097
She left me, l think,
it was so long ago l don't remember.

324
00:36:35,261 --> 00:36:39,334
Yes, she left you.
On September 8th, 1970.

325
00:36:39,501 --> 00:36:40,980
Exactly...

326
00:36:43,101 --> 00:36:45,934
You're distraught now,
that's normal.

327
00:36:46,101 --> 00:36:48,012
l'm not distraught.

328
00:36:48,141 --> 00:36:52,339
Elisa only ever loved one man.

329
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:55,259
- You.
- How can you say that?

330
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:58,254
l never saw Elisa again,
you were together for a lifetime!

331
00:36:58,421 --> 00:37:01,697
l found a diary of hers,
with a lock.

332
00:37:04,461 --> 00:37:05,814
And l broke the lock off.

333
00:37:08,701 --> 00:37:11,454
l write for a living, believe me...

334
00:37:12,501 --> 00:37:16,779
when you write, you give life
to fantasies, imagination, lies...

335
00:37:16,941 --> 00:37:20,297
l was only a good companion.

336
00:37:21,421 --> 00:37:24,413
That's all she wrote about me.

337
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:29,091
35 years together...

338
00:37:29,221 --> 00:37:33,533
and l'm mentioned in two lines
as a good companion.

339
00:37:39,381 --> 00:37:40,973
Here, Alfredo.

340
00:37:48,981 --> 00:37:51,051
What'll you do now?

341
00:37:52,421 --> 00:37:53,649
What l've always done.

342
00:37:55,701 --> 00:37:57,976
l'll live in adoration of her.

343
00:38:33,861 --> 00:38:35,533
What's he doing?

344
00:38:35,701 --> 00:38:37,214
Stop!

345
00:38:38,541 --> 00:38:40,020
Jep!

346
00:39:03,421 --> 00:39:04,900
Well done!

347
00:39:07,421 --> 00:39:09,013
He made it!

348
00:39:24,461 --> 00:39:27,817
- Have you seen my daughter?
- Your daughter? No.

349
00:39:32,741 --> 00:39:34,379
Francesca!

350
00:39:54,781 --> 00:39:56,134
Who are you?

351
00:39:58,181 --> 00:39:59,853
Who am l?

352
00:40:01,181 --> 00:40:04,093
- l am...
- No, you're nobody.

353
00:40:06,581 --> 00:40:08,333
Nobody?

354
00:40:09,221 --> 00:40:10,734
But l...

355
00:40:35,341 --> 00:40:36,933
Francesca, where on earth are you?

356
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,092
l've been looking for you
for over an hour!

357
00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:50,454
- Are you sad, sir?
- No.

358
00:40:50,821 --> 00:40:53,096
Sir is strange.

359
00:40:53,301 --> 00:40:56,099
l don't like that,
l prefer you to be sad.

360
00:40:56,421 --> 00:41:00,494
- Are you going to bed?
- Last night l went to bed at 22:30.

361
00:41:00,981 --> 00:41:03,131
Now l don't know what to do.

362
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:06,219
Morning is an unknown object to me.

363
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:07,296
Unknown.

364
00:41:07,421 --> 00:41:10,697
Sir can help me clean
the house then.

365
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:14,889
- Sir can't, sir feels strange.
- Sir is a rascal.

366
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:18,571
''ls there a new nation struggling
within the walls of the city?

367
00:41:19,261 --> 00:41:23,015
From the crevices of that soil
a feverish vapour ascends like smoke

368
00:41:23,221 --> 00:41:27,214
and works like a magic philtre
in the blood of some men

369
00:41:27,541 --> 00:41:33,059
producing a form of heroic madness
unlike any other.''

370
00:41:36,461 --> 00:41:39,498
What do you think? Shit,
it's powerful, don't you think?

371
00:41:40,101 --> 00:41:43,332
Why the hell do an adaptation
of D'Annunzio for the stage?

372
00:41:43,541 --> 00:41:46,260
D'Annunzio has always been
paradigmatic...

373
00:41:46,381 --> 00:41:50,659
You think that certain
intellectual feats give you dignity,

374
00:41:50,821 --> 00:41:53,619
and that others are better than you,
but you're wrong!

375
00:41:53,901 --> 00:41:57,735
Try and write something of your own,
like...

376
00:41:58,421 --> 00:42:00,377
a feeling, or sorrow...

377
00:42:00,501 --> 00:42:03,095
l've known you ages
but you've never been here.

378
00:42:03,301 --> 00:42:06,452
Don't get big-headed, you've got
a room in a student flat...

379
00:42:06,701 --> 00:42:09,818
Are you going out with that
gloomy girl you're always with?

380
00:42:09,981 --> 00:42:12,370
l wish!
l've tried it on 7,000 times.

381
00:42:12,501 --> 00:42:14,776
l've never even had a kiss,
not one!

382
00:42:14,941 --> 00:42:17,535
- She's a bitch.
- No, she's not.

383
00:42:19,461 --> 00:42:20,860
- She's complicated.
- She's a bitch.

384
00:42:20,981 --> 00:42:22,812
Trust me, you're too kind.

385
00:42:22,941 --> 00:42:26,820
l can tell her type from a mile off,
l don't even need to meet them.

386
00:42:27,021 --> 00:42:30,093
- What are you doing with that hat?
- My morning exercise.

387
00:42:30,221 --> 00:42:32,451
- That's exercise?
- Yes!

388
00:42:33,021 --> 00:42:35,296
Do you know how many women
you've been with?

389
00:42:35,541 --> 00:42:37,338
No, l'm rubbish at maths.

390
00:42:37,541 --> 00:42:39,611
l've always been good at maths.

391
00:42:39,741 --> 00:42:43,290
lt's six, l introduced you to them.

392
00:42:44,141 --> 00:42:45,972
Seven.

393
00:42:46,141 --> 00:42:47,699
- Seven?
- Seven.

394
00:42:48,181 --> 00:42:50,900
- When did number seven happen?
- Last summer.

395
00:42:51,021 --> 00:42:54,172
A friend of my sister's back home
when l went to see my folks.

396
00:42:54,741 --> 00:42:56,220
She runs a shop...

397
00:42:58,381 --> 00:43:00,975
- She's nice.
- That means she's a dog.

398
00:43:01,261 --> 00:43:03,695
What about you and Orietta?

399
00:43:03,941 --> 00:43:06,057
- Who's Orietta?
- Don't you know?

400
00:43:06,141 --> 00:43:09,292
She was at your house...
A real beauty.

401
00:43:09,421 --> 00:43:13,096
At my age, a beauty isn't enough.

402
00:43:26,261 --> 00:43:28,013
l might take up writing again.

403
00:43:29,061 --> 00:43:31,529
That's great news!

404
00:43:32,381 --> 00:43:33,780
Has something happened?

405
00:43:38,461 --> 00:43:39,814
Why?

406
00:43:39,981 --> 00:43:44,691
You want to write again after all
these years, something's happened.

407
00:43:47,061 --> 00:43:49,973
Something always happens in Rome.
Nothing's happened.

408
00:43:55,141 --> 00:43:56,972
What are you looking at?

409
00:43:58,101 --> 00:44:00,296
Come here.

410
00:44:07,261 --> 00:44:10,890
They met at university
10 days ago.

411
00:44:11,141 --> 00:44:15,453
They haven't stopped kissing
for 10 days.

412
00:44:24,461 --> 00:44:26,929
This generation of youths
horrifies me.

413
00:44:27,261 --> 00:44:31,174
Supported by this state for years,
when they realise they're smart,

414
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:33,212
they go study or work in America
or London,

415
00:44:33,341 --> 00:44:34,820
forgetting about the support.

416
00:44:34,981 --> 00:44:36,937
They have no civil vocation.

417
00:44:37,101 --> 00:44:39,012
As a young girl,
in the occupied arts department,

418
00:44:39,141 --> 00:44:40,460
l oozed civil vocation.

419
00:44:40,661 --> 00:44:43,255
- ls that so?
- Yes, why?

420
00:44:43,461 --> 00:44:45,531
- Come off it...
- What do you know?

421
00:44:45,701 --> 00:44:49,091
ln those years you were in Naples
being a loafer with posh girls

422
00:44:49,261 --> 00:44:51,138
and writing your only novelette.

423
00:44:51,341 --> 00:44:53,093
l didn't notice that history
was being made.

424
00:44:53,261 --> 00:44:57,937
Novelette? lt was a masterpiece
of ltalian literature!

425
00:44:58,101 --> 00:45:01,013
l confirm that Jep and civil
vocation never got along,

426
00:45:01,221 --> 00:45:03,257
he was lazy and the other
hyperactive.

427
00:45:03,381 --> 00:45:06,976
Romano, stop sucking up to your
idol, you're pathetic!

428
00:45:07,421 --> 00:45:10,493
''The Human Apparatus''
was a narrow-minded, frivolous book

429
00:45:10,661 --> 00:45:13,619
and pretentious too, like its title.
Jep knows that.

430
00:45:13,741 --> 00:45:17,700
- That's why he stopped there.
- Sorry, what about you then?

431
00:45:17,821 --> 00:45:19,812
l tried changing things
with literature.

432
00:45:19,941 --> 00:45:24,014
l wrote 11 novels, and a book about
the Party's official history.

433
00:45:24,261 --> 00:45:27,333
You're forgetting your contribution
to that reality show...

434
00:45:27,461 --> 00:45:29,850
''Girl Farm''.

435
00:45:29,981 --> 00:45:32,734
Television can be
a very formative experience!

436
00:45:32,901 --> 00:45:34,812
l always go when l'm invited.

437
00:45:35,021 --> 00:45:37,535
l get my hands dirty,
l try things...

438
00:45:37,661 --> 00:45:39,697
l don't spend my life being a snob.

439
00:45:39,821 --> 00:45:44,258
Are you saying that a socially
committed writer is advantaged,

440
00:45:44,501 --> 00:45:47,220
and safeguarded,
compared to a novelist

441
00:45:47,381 --> 00:45:49,770
who deals with, how can l say...
with feelings?

442
00:45:49,901 --> 00:45:51,573
Of course she is!

443
00:45:51,781 --> 00:45:54,693
The cause someone commits
their life to isn't secondary.

444
00:45:54,861 --> 00:45:56,852
Like creating a family,

445
00:45:56,981 --> 00:45:58,812
dedicating oneself with sacrifice

446
00:45:58,941 --> 00:46:01,614
to raising one's children day
after day.

447
00:46:01,821 --> 00:46:05,530
Eusebio and l have four children,
we plan the future together.

448
00:46:05,661 --> 00:46:08,129
l work hard
to be both a mother and a woman,

449
00:46:08,381 --> 00:46:12,659
but at the end of the day l feel
l've done something important.

450
00:46:12,861 --> 00:46:14,010
So if we don't have children

451
00:46:14,141 --> 00:46:17,497
we should contemplate
the idea of suicide?

452
00:46:17,661 --> 00:46:20,414
- l don't mean you, of course.
- She means me.

453
00:46:21,101 --> 00:46:24,616
Dadina, l admire you greatly.
You're a badass.

454
00:46:24,741 --> 00:46:27,414
Do you use ''badass''
in any of your 11 novels?

455
00:46:27,541 --> 00:46:30,772
Yes, l do, l try to be modern.

456
00:46:30,941 --> 00:46:32,977
- Modernity is badass.
- De gustibus.

457
00:46:33,141 --> 00:46:38,090
What great conviction!
Should l envy you or be repelled?

458
00:46:38,221 --> 00:46:41,497
Yes, l have convictions.
l'm 53...

459
00:46:41,621 --> 00:46:43,532
- You'd never know.
- Never.

460
00:46:43,741 --> 00:46:46,335
l'm 53, l've suffered,
l bounced back,

461
00:46:46,461 --> 00:46:48,452
and learned lots about life.

462
00:46:50,461 --> 00:46:53,021
Well, l can see you have nothing
to say, at last.

463
00:46:53,141 --> 00:46:54,369
l was drinking...

464
00:46:54,501 --> 00:46:58,414
As we care about you,
we don't want to embarrass you.

465
00:46:58,541 --> 00:47:01,294
You know, all this boastful talk,

466
00:47:01,501 --> 00:47:05,460
all this serious ostentatiousness,
all this ego...

467
00:47:06,301 --> 00:47:08,292
These harsh damning judgements
of yours

468
00:47:08,461 --> 00:47:10,850
hide a certain fragility,
a feeling of inadequacy

469
00:47:11,021 --> 00:47:15,333
and above all a series of untruths.
We care about you, we know you.

470
00:47:15,461 --> 00:47:19,340
We also know our untruths
and for this, unlike you,

471
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:22,294
we end up talking about nonsense,
about trivial matters,

472
00:47:22,461 --> 00:47:25,453
because we don't want
to revel in our pettiness.

473
00:47:25,581 --> 00:47:27,617
What untruths
are you talking about?

474
00:47:27,821 --> 00:47:30,415
Everything l said is true,
it's what l am, what l believe in.

475
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:34,540
Please, l'm a gentleman.
Don't destroy my only certainty.

476
00:47:34,621 --> 00:47:39,649
Tell me exactly what my lies are
and what my fragility is!

477
00:47:39,901 --> 00:47:42,654
l'm a woman with balls, tell me!

478
00:47:43,941 --> 00:47:47,456
''Woman with balls'' would be too much
for any gentleman.

479
00:47:47,581 --> 00:47:50,891
All right, Stefania,
you asked for it. ln random order:

480
00:47:51,581 --> 00:47:54,971
Your civil vocation during
your student days went unnoticed.

481
00:47:55,101 --> 00:47:58,980
But another vocation of yours
is remembered by many,

482
00:47:59,181 --> 00:48:02,890
the one practiced by you then,
in the university toilets.

483
00:48:03,621 --> 00:48:07,660
You wrote about the Party because
you were its leader's mistress.

484
00:48:07,781 --> 00:48:09,737
And your 11 novels,

485
00:48:09,861 --> 00:48:13,297
published by a small publishing
house subsidised by the Party,

486
00:48:13,421 --> 00:48:16,618
reviewed by minor Party-affiliated
newspapers,

487
00:48:17,221 --> 00:48:19,655
are insignificant,
everyone says so.

488
00:48:19,781 --> 00:48:22,932
l'm not saying my novelette
was any better,

489
00:48:23,061 --> 00:48:25,370
l agree with you there.

490
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:28,180
Your relationship with Eusebio...

491
00:48:28,901 --> 00:48:31,938
What relationship? Eusebio
loves Giordano, everyone knows.

492
00:48:33,861 --> 00:48:34,930
He has for years.

493
00:48:35,301 --> 00:48:38,179
They lunch every day
at Arnaldo's, under the coat rack,

494
00:48:38,301 --> 00:48:42,010
like sweethearts under an oak tree.
You all know but turn a blind eye.

495
00:48:42,501 --> 00:48:46,892
Your dedication to your children,
with all the sacrifices entailed...

496
00:48:47,221 --> 00:48:49,655
You work all week in TV,
you go out every night,

497
00:48:49,821 --> 00:48:54,019
even on Mondays, when popper
dealers don't even venture out.

498
00:48:54,141 --> 00:48:55,699
You're never with your children,

499
00:48:55,821 --> 00:48:58,415
not even on the
long holidays you take.

500
00:48:58,541 --> 00:49:02,250
And plus you have a butler,
a waiter,

501
00:49:03,421 --> 00:49:07,380
a cook, a chauffeur
who drives the kids to school,

502
00:49:07,541 --> 00:49:09,213
three babysitters, so...

503
00:49:09,341 --> 00:49:13,619
how and when exactly
do you make any sacrifices?

504
00:49:14,221 --> 00:49:17,179
These are the untruths and fragility
l'm talking about.

505
00:49:19,461 --> 00:49:22,100
Stefania, mother and woman.

506
00:49:22,301 --> 00:49:26,977
You're 53, with a life in tatters,
like the rest of us.

507
00:49:28,021 --> 00:49:31,775
lnstead of acting superior
and treating us with contempt,

508
00:49:31,941 --> 00:49:34,933
you should look at us
with affection.

509
00:49:35,701 --> 00:49:37,578
We're all on the brink of despair,

510
00:49:37,701 --> 00:49:40,261
all we can do
is look each other in the face,

511
00:49:40,421 --> 00:49:44,300
keep each other company,
joke a little...

512
00:49:44,421 --> 00:49:45,570
Don't you agree?

513
00:52:25,101 --> 00:52:27,137
Son of a bitch!

514
00:52:28,101 --> 00:52:29,500
Egidio, old chap!

515
00:52:29,741 --> 00:52:32,892
Bastard!
l haven't seen you in 30 years!

516
00:52:44,981 --> 00:52:47,973
- l need to talk to you.
- Later! l'm busy, can't you see?

517
00:52:48,101 --> 00:52:51,059
- ls this still your place?
- Luckily not, l sold it.

518
00:52:51,221 --> 00:52:52,734
l'm still the manager though.

519
00:52:52,861 --> 00:52:56,979
You're famous! You're always
in the gossip rags.

520
00:52:57,181 --> 00:52:59,695
You're at all the VlP parties,
always with a girl!

521
00:52:59,861 --> 00:53:01,658
You never come here...

522
00:53:01,821 --> 00:53:05,177
Get lost, will you?
We're having a serious talk!

523
00:53:05,381 --> 00:53:07,690
- Are you married?
- Married, divorced.

524
00:53:07,821 --> 00:53:11,450
- l've got a daughter, Ramona.
- Did you have to call her Ramona?

525
00:53:11,581 --> 00:53:13,731
You artists are all the same!

526
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:16,853
l tell you l have a daughter
and you complain about her name!

527
00:53:17,021 --> 00:53:18,852
What's wrong with ''Ramona''?

528
00:53:19,061 --> 00:53:21,780
Nothing, it's a name that implies
ambitions...

529
00:53:21,941 --> 00:53:23,897
There's my daughter, you see?

530
00:53:35,781 --> 00:53:38,500
She makes me so mad,
l've told her a million times!

531
00:53:38,661 --> 00:53:40,538
You're too old for this!

532
00:53:40,661 --> 00:53:44,017
Now these hot young Polish girls
rule the scene.

533
00:53:44,261 --> 00:53:46,616
They're experts at turning tricks.

534
00:53:46,741 --> 00:53:49,778
She's 42 and she wants to be
a sophisticated stripper.

535
00:53:49,941 --> 00:53:52,409
But the world's no longer
sophisticated. Right, Jep?

536
00:53:52,581 --> 00:53:55,015
l know, only you and l are.

537
00:53:55,181 --> 00:53:56,819
That's right, goddammit!

538
00:53:57,021 --> 00:54:00,491
But she wants to keep doing
this job, for the money.

539
00:54:00,781 --> 00:54:02,339
l don't know why
she always needs money

540
00:54:02,461 --> 00:54:03,814
and what she fucking
does with it.

541
00:54:03,941 --> 00:54:07,695
- For drugs? - l wish,
we'd have a common interest.

542
00:54:07,821 --> 00:54:09,493
She doesn't even drink beer.

543
00:54:09,741 --> 00:54:12,653
l don't know what she spends
her money on, she's always broke.

544
00:54:12,861 --> 00:54:15,375
- Do l seem like a loser?
- No, why?

545
00:54:15,541 --> 00:54:19,580
Because l can hear myself talk,
l sound like a loser.

546
00:54:19,701 --> 00:54:23,376
l'm nearly 70 and l have to work
till 6 in the morning every day.

547
00:54:23,501 --> 00:54:26,891
l swapped cocaine for heroin
15 years ago.

548
00:54:27,021 --> 00:54:30,696
What an asshole!
A heroin junkie at 50!

549
00:54:30,941 --> 00:54:32,533
Could l be more of a loser?

550
00:54:32,661 --> 00:54:37,212
But l'm not important,
it's her l worry about, l love her.

551
00:54:37,421 --> 00:54:39,889
And l'm no loser there,
l'm a father.

552
00:54:40,021 --> 00:54:42,057
And like all fathers, l'm worried.

553
00:54:42,181 --> 00:54:43,933
What'll she do in a few years?

554
00:54:44,101 --> 00:54:46,137
She can't be a stripper at 50!

555
00:54:48,861 --> 00:54:50,897
- Why don't you fix her up?
- Me?

556
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:55,458
Don't you know any rich guys
who want a beautiful wife?

557
00:54:55,661 --> 00:54:58,221
We could change her name,
that's no problem.

558
00:54:58,341 --> 00:55:00,013
You'd do me a big favour.

559
00:55:00,261 --> 00:55:04,891
- l'm a writer, not a pimp.
- Sorry, l was a bit vulgar.

560
00:55:05,021 --> 00:55:08,730
Daddy's little girl, this is
my good friend, Jep Gambardella.

561
00:55:08,901 --> 00:55:11,779
l'll leave you to it,
l need the toilet.

562
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:13,420
Be right back!

563
00:55:14,621 --> 00:55:16,851
- Hi, l'm Jep.
- Ramona.

564
00:55:30,501 --> 00:55:34,813
- lf you want a girl, get a Pole.
- Are you kidding?

565
00:55:35,581 --> 00:55:38,778
Who wants a girl?
Not me.

566
00:55:38,901 --> 00:55:41,369
l really am an old friend
of your father's.

567
00:55:41,901 --> 00:55:43,732
- Dad has no friends.
- He used to.

568
00:55:43,901 --> 00:55:47,211
When l came to Rome, l'd wait for
my friends to leave to come here.

569
00:55:47,541 --> 00:55:49,133
Your father was a nice guy.

570
00:55:49,301 --> 00:55:52,373
He taught me loads of things,
such as: vodka is uncouth.

571
00:55:53,301 --> 00:55:54,734
How useful!

572
00:55:56,821 --> 00:55:58,539
He asked me to find you a husband.

573
00:55:58,661 --> 00:56:02,176
He's obsessed.
l'm not looking for a husband.

574
00:56:02,421 --> 00:56:04,457
Well, you should be.

575
00:56:05,021 --> 00:56:07,740
- A family's a beautiful thing.
- l know.

576
00:56:07,861 --> 00:56:10,250
But l'm not cut out
for beautiful things.

577
00:56:25,301 --> 00:56:27,257
What's wrong?

578
00:56:28,181 --> 00:56:31,378
- l feel old.
- You're no spring chicken.

579
00:58:14,861 --> 00:58:16,260
One.

580
00:58:20,061 --> 00:58:22,052
- How are you?
- Very well.

581
00:58:22,221 --> 00:58:25,054
Just got back from lndia,
l had amazing dysentery.

582
00:58:25,661 --> 00:58:28,778
Come to my divorce party,
l'll have burlesque dancers there.

583
00:58:28,941 --> 00:58:31,899
Of course.
What present would you like?

584
00:58:32,021 --> 00:58:35,093
One big wish: for the wars
in the Middle East to end.

585
00:58:35,301 --> 00:58:36,814
- l'll do my best.
- Two.

586
00:58:37,101 --> 00:58:38,454
700 euros.

587
00:58:38,581 --> 00:58:39,900
Thank you.

588
00:58:40,221 --> 00:58:41,370
Tell me, darling.

589
00:58:41,661 --> 00:58:46,177
Perhaps...
l was thinking, my mouth...

590
00:58:47,101 --> 00:58:49,456
l'm scared, l've never
done it before, professor.

591
00:58:50,021 --> 00:58:54,572
Don't call me professor.
Call me ''my friend'' or ''my love''.

592
00:58:54,701 --> 00:58:56,498
We all need love.

593
00:58:57,301 --> 00:59:00,259
What star sign are you,
deeply intense lady?

594
00:59:00,381 --> 00:59:02,099
- Aquarius.
- l knew it!

595
00:59:02,221 --> 00:59:05,657
Want to go back 30 years, to when
it rained at the end of August?

596
00:59:06,221 --> 00:59:08,371
- Done.
- That's 700 euros.

597
00:59:08,901 --> 00:59:09,777
Three.

598
00:59:14,581 --> 00:59:19,211
- You've been to see Casagrande!
- No, l don't even know him.

599
00:59:19,341 --> 00:59:20,296
You betrayed me, darling!

600
00:59:20,501 --> 00:59:24,335
We're undergoing a journey,
and you've interrupted it.

601
00:59:25,741 --> 00:59:27,857
This is the last time.

602
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:33,334
Go, go.

603
00:59:33,501 --> 00:59:35,059
Bye then.

604
00:59:35,261 --> 00:59:37,456
- Full price.
- Five.

605
00:59:37,621 --> 00:59:38,895
1,200 euros.

606
00:59:39,901 --> 00:59:41,334
- How's your mom?
- She's fine, thank you.

607
00:59:42,501 --> 00:59:44,457
- Seven.
- 700 euros.

608
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:45,855
Have you filled out, darling?

609
00:59:46,021 --> 00:59:47,500
You're always in my heart.

610
00:59:47,621 --> 00:59:48,849
700 euros.

611
00:59:49,021 --> 00:59:51,581
- As handsome as ever.
- Ten.

612
00:59:51,781 --> 00:59:53,453
- You're my pride.
- Thanks.

613
00:59:54,621 --> 00:59:56,179
Eleven.

614
01:00:00,701 --> 01:00:04,376
Professor, l'm here about
my hyperhidrosis.

615
01:00:04,581 --> 01:00:06,776
Where does this undesired
perspiration happen?

616
01:00:07,261 --> 01:00:09,092
On my hands.

617
01:00:13,061 --> 01:00:16,212
- Pray for me, sister.
- You don't need my prayers.

618
01:00:16,341 --> 01:00:21,290
You don't know how much of my income
l must surrender to the tax man.

619
01:00:21,461 --> 01:00:23,258
Go, sister, go.

620
01:00:32,061 --> 01:00:33,380
That's 700, sister.

621
01:00:34,941 --> 01:00:37,057
Fourteen.

622
01:00:54,701 --> 01:00:57,374
- Spying on me?
- No, l was going to knock.

623
01:00:57,701 --> 01:00:59,896
- When?
- When you were more relaxed.

624
01:01:13,421 --> 01:01:17,050
- What brings you here?
- Nothing, l'm just curious.

625
01:01:18,301 --> 01:01:21,691
- l told you what l think.
- l've no hidden agenda.

626
01:01:21,821 --> 01:01:26,292
Do you think every guy
who comes near you wants sex?

627
01:01:26,461 --> 01:01:28,691
Perhaps they just want to talk,

628
01:01:28,861 --> 01:01:32,137
driven by simple
and harmless curiosity.

629
01:01:32,261 --> 01:01:34,456
- That's never happened to me.
- lt has now.

630
01:01:36,541 --> 01:01:38,418
Wouldn't armbands be more
comfortable?

631
01:01:38,541 --> 01:01:41,260
Yes, but they irritate my armpits.

632
01:01:43,301 --> 01:01:45,292
Any plans for lunch?

633
01:01:45,421 --> 01:01:47,377
l'm going to my mum's with my dad.

634
01:01:47,501 --> 01:01:49,617
So where's the dog?

635
01:01:50,381 --> 01:01:51,894
What dog?

636
01:01:52,021 --> 01:01:55,058
People buy houses like this
so they can have dogs.

637
01:01:55,181 --> 01:01:59,697
l had a Labrador, but 9 years ago
he got fed up and left me.

638
01:02:00,461 --> 01:02:02,292
Labradors are dumb.

639
01:02:02,701 --> 01:02:05,215
And Cocker Spaniels are dumb too.

640
01:02:12,541 --> 01:02:14,054
Hi, Jep.

641
01:02:14,741 --> 01:02:16,413
Hi, Antonello.

642
01:02:17,661 --> 01:02:20,539
- You know Venditti?
- l know everyone.

643
01:02:21,301 --> 01:02:24,259
lt must be very satisfying
knowing so many people!

644
01:02:24,381 --> 01:02:27,976
- You're guaranteed to be unhappy.
- Have people let you down?

645
01:02:29,621 --> 01:02:31,930
l've let them down.

646
01:02:33,181 --> 01:02:34,614
Andrea! Are you with your mom?

647
01:02:34,741 --> 01:02:36,493
- She's parking.
- How are you?

648
01:02:36,621 --> 01:02:38,213
Not well.

649
01:02:38,341 --> 01:02:41,333
Proust says that death
may come to us this afternoon.

650
01:02:41,461 --> 01:02:42,860
Proust is scary.

651
01:02:42,981 --> 01:02:46,018
Not tomorrow, not in a year,
but this afternoon.

652
01:02:46,141 --> 01:02:49,019
But it's evening already
so it'd be tomorrow afternoon.

653
01:02:49,141 --> 01:02:52,895
Turgenev said: ''Death looked at me,
noticing me.''

654
01:02:53,101 --> 01:02:55,569
Don't take these writers
so seriously!

655
01:02:55,701 --> 01:02:57,771
Who should l take seriously then?

656
01:02:57,901 --> 01:03:01,211
Nothing, apart from the menu,
of course.

657
01:03:03,661 --> 01:03:07,734
Things are too complicated to be
understood by one individual.

658
01:03:08,461 --> 01:03:11,976
Just because you don't understand
doesn't mean nobody can.

659
01:03:15,421 --> 01:03:18,140
- Your reply?
- My reply?

660
01:03:18,941 --> 01:03:21,216
- Jep!
- Hello, Viola.

661
01:03:21,901 --> 01:03:24,335
- Good evening.
- Viola.

662
01:03:24,461 --> 01:03:27,612
Darling, why don't you
get a table for us?

663
01:03:30,741 --> 01:03:32,140
How did you find him?

664
01:03:33,581 --> 01:03:35,492
- He's better.
- Good, very good.

665
01:03:35,741 --> 01:03:38,130
He's much better, l'm so happy!

666
01:03:38,261 --> 01:03:40,491
- Dinner on Thursday?
- Of course!

667
01:03:40,621 --> 01:03:42,100
On Thursday l'm inexplicably free.

668
01:03:42,461 --> 01:03:47,535
Did you hear about Valentina Lemme?
She's dating her personal trainer.

669
01:03:47,661 --> 01:03:49,731
Really? lt doesn't show.

670
01:03:50,341 --> 01:03:53,060
- l invited her anyway.
- Are you sure?

671
01:03:53,181 --> 01:03:56,696
She's nasty, you know.
She's like the devil!

672
01:03:56,981 --> 01:03:58,699
Really? You think so?

673
01:03:58,821 --> 01:04:02,131
l see her at yoga twice a week.

674
01:04:02,261 --> 01:04:04,138
- You'll come?
- Of course.

675
01:04:04,261 --> 01:04:06,729
- See you Thursday.
- Okay.

676
01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:08,774
Goodbye.

677
01:04:11,301 --> 01:04:16,056
Watch that table carefully, but
don't let them notice you looking.

678
01:04:18,061 --> 01:04:21,371
Waiter? Champagne, please.
Cristal.

679
01:04:21,501 --> 01:04:24,140
You can't imagine
how much one learns

680
01:04:24,381 --> 01:04:27,851
by living alongside
a cluster of religious institutes.

681
01:04:41,901 --> 01:04:44,495
So that was your first time?

682
01:04:44,621 --> 01:04:49,456
Yes, he didn't think he'd been good,
too quick, he said.

683
01:04:49,581 --> 01:04:52,732
So, out of anger or to let off
steam, l'm not sure which,

684
01:04:52,861 --> 01:04:56,410
he got a football
and played with it furiously!

685
01:04:56,661 --> 01:04:58,140
And you?

686
01:04:58,221 --> 01:05:01,179
l didn't enjoy making love with him,

687
01:05:01,261 --> 01:05:05,812
but seeing him with a football
was an unforgettable thing!

688
01:05:06,781 --> 01:05:10,774
He became really good,
he played on the national team.

689
01:05:14,621 --> 01:05:17,181
Your dad said you spend everything
you earn.

690
01:05:17,261 --> 01:05:19,092
What on? You can tell me.

691
01:05:21,021 --> 01:05:24,775
Maybe one day. But why didn't you
write another book?

692
01:05:24,901 --> 01:05:27,096
Because l went out too much
at night.

693
01:05:29,941 --> 01:05:31,738
Rome makes you waste a lot of time.

694
01:05:32,021 --> 01:05:36,776
lt's distracting.
Writing requires focus and peace.

695
01:05:37,221 --> 01:05:39,371
That's not much of an answer.

696
01:05:39,621 --> 01:05:42,852
You have plenty of peace here,
it's like being in the country.

697
01:05:43,021 --> 01:05:48,049
l wrote in short spurts.
l was a sprint-style writer.

698
01:05:52,581 --> 01:05:55,175
l told you about my first time...

699
01:05:55,381 --> 01:05:58,293
but you've told me nothing.
lt's your turn now.

700
01:06:07,061 --> 01:06:10,292
On an island... one summer.

701
01:06:10,421 --> 01:06:12,059
l was...

702
01:06:13,101 --> 01:06:14,420
18, she was 20.

703
01:06:16,461 --> 01:06:18,179
At the lighthouse, at night.

704
01:06:20,941 --> 01:06:23,978
l went to kiss her,
she turned away.

705
01:06:25,501 --> 01:06:27,378
l was disappointed.

706
01:06:29,581 --> 01:06:32,220
But then she turned to look at me.

707
01:06:32,901 --> 01:06:35,017
She brushed me with her lips...

708
01:06:35,901 --> 01:06:37,175
she smelled of flowers.

709
01:06:38,981 --> 01:06:42,974
l didn't move,
l wasn't able to move.

710
01:06:46,701 --> 01:06:50,694
Then she took a step back...
and said...

711
01:06:57,541 --> 01:06:58,735
She took a step back.

712
01:07:03,461 --> 01:07:05,213
And said...

713
01:07:20,141 --> 01:07:22,291
l'm going home, it's late.

714
01:07:22,461 --> 01:07:25,339
Want to come to a party
tomorrow night?

715
01:08:12,061 --> 01:08:13,176
Outstanding!

716
01:08:14,901 --> 01:08:17,290
Did you want us to die tonight?

717
01:08:17,581 --> 01:08:20,732
You won't believe it,
but l love knife throwers.

718
01:08:20,861 --> 01:08:23,500
A true likeness,
especially the hips.

719
01:08:23,901 --> 01:08:27,974
A masterpiece, Geronimo.
lt'll look great on the mantelpiece.

720
01:09:24,301 --> 01:09:26,292
God bless you, Jep!

721
01:09:26,661 --> 01:09:28,060
This is Ramona.

722
01:09:28,181 --> 01:09:29,978
What a unique and marvellous
creature.

723
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:32,850
- ls he taking the piss?
- lt's hard to know.

724
01:09:33,021 --> 01:09:34,579
l was being honest.

725
01:09:34,741 --> 01:09:36,891
l'm just sorry you missed
Geronimo D.

726
01:09:37,261 --> 01:09:41,140
- What a tragedy!
- Come in, make yourselves at home.

727
01:09:41,901 --> 01:09:43,971
- Who is that asshole?
- Lillo De Gregorio.

728
01:09:44,101 --> 01:09:47,252
The greatest modern art collector
in this debauched country.

729
01:09:47,541 --> 01:09:51,819
- What's Jep's floozy friend wearing?
- l don't know.

730
01:09:51,981 --> 01:09:55,132
Jep's proving to be
a disappointment.

731
01:09:55,301 --> 01:09:58,338
- Good evening, countess.
- Hello, you're looking well.

732
01:09:58,541 --> 01:10:02,739
l wish l could say that same
about the count. Hello, ladies!

733
01:10:03,141 --> 01:10:06,019
Are you stupid?
You're distracting my artist.

734
01:10:06,141 --> 01:10:07,540
Dad, we're having fun.

735
01:10:07,741 --> 01:10:10,175
Carmelina, come and do some work.

736
01:10:10,301 --> 01:10:12,098
Mom, l want to play here.

737
01:10:12,221 --> 01:10:15,293
- Has this human being gone mad?
- We'll sort it out.

738
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:18,658
- l'm not coming, l'm staying here.
- You don't mean that.

739
01:10:18,781 --> 01:10:20,976
Europe's greatest gallery owners
are outside.

740
01:10:21,101 --> 01:10:24,889
lf you show them what you can do
then ours will be a happy family.

741
01:10:25,021 --> 01:10:27,774
But l'm already happy,
l want to be a vet one day.

742
01:10:27,941 --> 01:10:32,810
Get to bed, you two!
My kids are going to bed.

743
01:10:32,981 --> 01:10:33,891
Come.

744
01:10:34,021 --> 01:10:36,455
l'll go to bed too.
l'm a kid too.

745
01:10:41,461 --> 01:10:43,736
She blushes and says:

746
01:10:43,941 --> 01:10:48,093
''Forgive me, l didn't know
you loved me so much.

747
01:10:48,501 --> 01:10:51,459
My ignorance is obscene.''

748
01:10:51,941 --> 01:10:54,171
He looks at her, reassuringly,
and says:

749
01:10:54,381 --> 01:10:57,578
''Let me defend our love''.

750
01:10:57,741 --> 01:11:00,460
How's that for the start
of the second act?

751
01:11:00,581 --> 01:11:02,572
You've written a pile of shit.

752
01:13:53,221 --> 01:13:55,132
That girl was crying.

753
01:13:55,221 --> 01:13:57,894
Nonsense!
That girl earns millions!

754
01:13:59,021 --> 01:14:00,852
Excuse me a moment.

755
01:14:03,781 --> 01:14:06,659
- Hi, Stefano.
- Hi.

756
01:14:07,301 --> 01:14:10,976
- The catering's gone downhill.
- Rome's gone downhill.

757
01:14:11,061 --> 01:14:12,460
Steeply downhill!

758
01:14:15,941 --> 01:14:18,091
Do you have the case with you?

759
01:14:20,821 --> 01:14:23,335
- l always do.
- You up for it?

760
01:15:27,621 --> 01:15:28,656
See that?

761
01:15:33,781 --> 01:15:38,013
Stefano has the keys to Rome's
most beautiful buildings.

762
01:15:39,621 --> 01:15:41,134
ls he a doorman?

763
01:15:42,901 --> 01:15:45,176
No, he's not a doorman.

764
01:15:45,501 --> 01:15:47,935
He's friends with princesses.

765
01:15:50,981 --> 01:15:52,334
Are you ready?

766
01:15:53,301 --> 01:15:54,700
Come with me.

767
01:17:54,541 --> 01:17:56,736
Good evening, Princesses.

768
01:17:56,861 --> 01:17:59,011
Good evening.

769
01:18:11,741 --> 01:18:13,493
How come you have all these keys?

770
01:18:15,421 --> 01:18:17,059
Because...

771
01:18:18,581 --> 01:18:20,412
l'm a trustworthy person.

772
01:18:35,381 --> 01:18:39,579
Did you see? lt looked huge,
but it's tiny.

773
01:18:41,261 --> 01:18:44,458
Stay still, l'll take a photo of you.
Don't move.

774
01:18:48,021 --> 01:18:50,296
That's no good.
Laugh.

775
01:18:52,621 --> 01:18:54,100
Got it?

776
01:18:54,501 --> 01:18:56,651
Yes, that's good.

777
01:19:47,981 --> 01:19:50,939
Many think that a funeral,

778
01:19:51,061 --> 01:19:54,212
is a fortuitous event,
without any rules.

779
01:19:54,901 --> 01:19:56,380
That's not true.

780
01:19:56,901 --> 01:20:00,576
A funeral is a high-society event
par excellence.

781
01:20:02,061 --> 01:20:05,337
You must never forget
that at a funeral

782
01:20:06,181 --> 01:20:08,297
you are appearing on stage.

783
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:14,020
Nice.

784
01:20:14,941 --> 01:20:16,579
Nice, but try the other one.

785
01:20:18,461 --> 01:20:23,330
You must patiently wait
for the relatives to disperse.

786
01:20:23,821 --> 01:20:28,690
Once you are sure
that all the guests are seated...

787
01:20:28,901 --> 01:20:32,530
only at that point, may you offer
your condolences to the family.

788
01:20:33,061 --> 01:20:36,974
ln this way, everyone will see you.

789
01:20:37,221 --> 01:20:39,610
You take the mourner's hands,

790
01:20:39,781 --> 01:20:43,410
and rest yours on their arms.

791
01:20:43,821 --> 01:20:47,450
You whisper something to them,
a comforting phrase,

792
01:20:47,661 --> 01:20:49,652
said with authority.

793
01:20:49,781 --> 01:20:52,136
For example:

794
01:20:52,261 --> 01:20:56,857
''ln the days to come,
when you feel the void,

795
01:20:57,541 --> 01:21:01,978
l want you to know
that you can always count on me.''

796
01:21:03,461 --> 01:21:05,338
The public will ask...

797
01:21:06,981 --> 01:21:09,859
''What's Jep Gambardella saying?''

798
01:21:22,541 --> 01:21:24,532
This is definitely the right dress.

799
01:21:29,621 --> 01:21:34,058
You're allowed to retire
to a corner by yourself,

800
01:21:34,541 --> 01:21:37,738
as if contemplating your sorrow.

801
01:21:39,141 --> 01:21:43,612
However, another matter
must be approached with shrewdness.

802
01:21:44,301 --> 01:21:48,692
The chosen place needs
to be isolated

803
01:21:48,821 --> 01:21:50,857
but clearly visible
to the public.

804
01:21:51,581 --> 01:21:57,690
Besides, a performance is good when
it is devoid of any superfluity.

805
01:22:00,061 --> 01:22:01,813
So, the fundamental rule:

806
01:22:03,421 --> 01:22:05,810
one must never cry at a funeral.

807
01:22:06,941 --> 01:22:09,933
You must never steal the show
from the family's sorrow.

808
01:22:10,061 --> 01:22:13,133
That is forbidden.

809
01:22:16,061 --> 01:22:17,813
Because it is immoral.

810
01:22:54,421 --> 01:22:56,093
Viola.

811
01:23:04,421 --> 01:23:08,937
ln the days to come,
when you feel the void,

812
01:23:10,181 --> 01:23:12,456
you can always count on me.

813
01:24:00,581 --> 01:24:06,099
Now l ask Andrea's friends
to come forward,

814
01:24:07,981 --> 01:24:10,814
so that the coffin
may be carried outside.

815
01:24:32,341 --> 01:24:33,410
Your back!

816
01:25:42,301 --> 01:25:44,576
lt was nice not making love.

817
01:25:46,341 --> 01:25:48,218
lt was nice loving each other.

818
01:25:49,021 --> 01:25:52,650
l'd forgotten what loving someone
was about, l'd forgotten that.

819
01:25:59,381 --> 01:26:01,941
l spend all my money to cure myself.

820
01:26:10,701 --> 01:26:12,692
Your breakfast.

821
01:26:13,781 --> 01:26:16,818
Come on, l'm taking you to see
a sea monster today.

822
01:26:37,661 --> 01:26:39,174
Your breakfast.

823
01:26:41,341 --> 01:26:43,332
Five more minutes.

824
01:26:50,181 --> 01:26:52,217
Can you see the sea?

825
01:26:58,981 --> 01:27:00,699
Where?

826
01:27:00,861 --> 01:27:02,533
On the ceiling.

827
01:27:08,621 --> 01:27:10,657
Yes, l can see it.

828
01:28:41,301 --> 01:28:44,054
Who's going to look after you now?

829
01:28:58,421 --> 01:29:02,334
l'm sorry about your daughter.
My condolences.

830
01:29:27,701 --> 01:29:33,458
l spent all my summers
making plans for September.

831
01:29:33,581 --> 01:29:35,173
Not any longer.

832
01:29:36,621 --> 01:29:40,739
Now l spend the summer
remembering the good intentions

833
01:29:41,261 --> 01:29:43,172
which vanished.

834
01:29:43,741 --> 01:29:47,620
ln part because of laziness,
in part because of carelessness.

835
01:29:50,821 --> 01:29:53,654
What's wrong
with feeling nostalgic?

836
01:29:55,181 --> 01:29:57,251
lt's the only distraction left
for those

837
01:29:57,381 --> 01:29:59,895
who've no faith
in the future!

838
01:30:03,541 --> 01:30:05,338
Without rain...

839
01:30:05,781 --> 01:30:10,172
August is coming to an end
and September isn't arriving.

840
01:30:11,541 --> 01:30:13,850
And l'm so ordinary!

841
01:30:14,541 --> 01:30:16,850
But there's no need to worry.

842
01:30:17,261 --> 01:30:20,219
lt's all right, it's okay.

843
01:30:27,741 --> 01:30:29,140
Bravo!

844
01:30:44,341 --> 01:30:45,694
Thank you.

845
01:31:31,301 --> 01:31:33,656
What are you doing here?

846
01:31:34,541 --> 01:31:37,931
Arturo!
Why are you here?

847
01:31:38,101 --> 01:31:41,411
Don't you see?
l'm rehearsing my magic show.

848
01:31:41,541 --> 01:31:45,500
This is tomorrow's special number:
the vanishing giraffe.

849
01:31:46,261 --> 01:31:47,979
You can make this giraffe vanish?

850
01:31:48,101 --> 01:31:51,059
Of course l can make
the giraffe vanish!

851
01:31:52,581 --> 01:31:54,970
Then make me vanish too.

852
01:31:56,421 --> 01:32:02,132
Jep, do you think that if l could
really make people vanish

853
01:32:02,541 --> 01:32:06,375
l'd still be here at my age
playing these circus games?

854
01:32:07,621 --> 01:32:09,179
lt's just a trick.

855
01:32:13,501 --> 01:32:15,139
lt's just a trick!

856
01:32:24,541 --> 01:32:26,497
Romano, how did it go?

857
01:32:26,741 --> 01:32:28,652
Well, they clapped.

858
01:32:28,981 --> 01:32:30,733
l'm glad.

859
01:32:31,061 --> 01:32:33,734
- So why are you so sad?
- l'm not sad.

860
01:32:34,021 --> 01:32:35,534
What's with the giraffe?

861
01:32:35,701 --> 01:32:38,454
For a magic show.
l'll come and see you tomorrow.

862
01:32:38,621 --> 01:32:40,452
l'm not doing the show tomorrow.

863
01:32:41,341 --> 01:32:43,013
Why not? You said it went well.

864
01:32:43,141 --> 01:32:47,896
l'm leaving, l'm going back
to my home town, for good.

865
01:32:48,141 --> 01:32:51,611
l won't even pack up my things,
l'll leave it all.

866
01:32:53,981 --> 01:32:57,257
l've lived in this city
for 40 years.

867
01:32:58,061 --> 01:33:00,256
And in the end l thought...

868
01:33:01,781 --> 01:33:04,454
the only person
who deserved a goodbye

869
01:33:04,861 --> 01:33:06,692
was you.

870
01:33:08,701 --> 01:33:10,771
So you're leaving?

871
01:33:13,021 --> 01:33:15,933
Romano... why are you leaving?

872
01:33:16,421 --> 01:33:18,855
Rome has really disappointed me.

873
01:33:24,461 --> 01:33:26,099
Bye, Jep.

874
01:33:45,341 --> 01:33:46,899
See?

875
01:34:15,301 --> 01:34:18,338
- Want some coffee?
- No, thanks. l know you're busy.

876
01:34:18,501 --> 01:34:20,173
l need to ask you something.

877
01:34:20,701 --> 01:34:22,180
Go ahead.

878
01:34:26,301 --> 01:34:28,576
Why did Elisa leave me?

879
01:34:31,661 --> 01:34:33,333
l don't know.

880
01:34:33,461 --> 01:34:37,340
Didn't she say anything about it
in her diary?

881
01:34:37,941 --> 01:34:40,011
No, l don't think so.

882
01:34:43,021 --> 01:34:46,730
Would you be offended
if l asked to read it?

883
01:34:46,901 --> 01:34:49,574
No, l wouldn't.

884
01:34:50,181 --> 01:34:52,456
ln fact, l'd understand.

885
01:34:54,221 --> 01:34:56,496
But l'm afraid l can't
let you read it.

886
01:34:56,661 --> 01:34:57,650
Why not?

887
01:34:58,621 --> 01:35:01,340
Because a few days after the
funeral, l threw it away.

888
01:35:06,941 --> 01:35:09,011
May l introduce you
to my girlfriend?

889
01:35:10,501 --> 01:35:12,810
Hello, my name's Polina.

890
01:35:15,821 --> 01:35:18,460
Like Polina in ''The Gambler''
by Dostoyevsky.

891
01:35:24,541 --> 01:35:26,372
What are you doing tonight?

892
01:35:28,101 --> 01:35:29,978
Nothing.

893
01:35:30,541 --> 01:35:32,418
Polina's going to finish ironing...

894
01:35:33,301 --> 01:35:35,531
then we'll drink a glass
of red wine.

895
01:35:36,261 --> 01:35:39,856
We'll watch some television
and go to bed.

896
01:35:41,021 --> 01:35:41,976
What about you?

897
01:35:43,621 --> 01:35:48,092
l'll have a lot of drinks, but not
so many as to become unruly.

898
01:35:48,901 --> 01:35:51,017
And then...

899
01:35:52,021 --> 01:35:56,412
when you'll be getting up
l'll be going to bed.

900
01:36:03,061 --> 01:36:06,212
What lovely people you are!

901
01:36:16,221 --> 01:36:18,291
l love doing the train!

902
01:36:22,661 --> 01:36:24,140
l'll screw you.

903
01:36:26,501 --> 01:36:28,492
''Who am l?''

904
01:36:30,141 --> 01:36:33,178
That's how
one of Breton's novels began.

905
01:36:34,061 --> 01:36:37,133
And of course in the book
there's no reply.

906
01:36:38,141 --> 01:36:40,450
- Did you hear about Viola?
- What?

907
01:36:40,661 --> 01:36:42,174
She's donating everything
to the church.

908
01:36:43,061 --> 01:36:47,532
She works in the parish
and is going to volunteer in Africa.

909
01:36:47,821 --> 01:36:52,497
The trains at our parties
are the best ones in Rome!

910
01:36:53,341 --> 01:36:55,332
- You think so?
- l do.

911
01:36:56,861 --> 01:37:00,376
They're the best because
they go nowhere.

912
01:37:11,141 --> 01:37:13,496
- Well?
- lt's wonderful, thank you.

913
01:37:13,621 --> 01:37:16,181
Come on, it's all gone.

914
01:37:16,301 --> 01:37:19,737
Tell me why you left me, please.

915
01:37:19,861 --> 01:37:22,170
l want an explanation, please!

916
01:37:23,021 --> 01:37:26,058
Go away!
Get out! Get out!

917
01:37:50,901 --> 01:37:52,732
You see all these people?

918
01:37:53,781 --> 01:37:55,772
They can't do anything.

919
01:37:56,341 --> 01:37:58,980
But l know how to do something.

920
01:37:59,741 --> 01:38:02,414
We know how to do something.

921
01:38:03,701 --> 01:38:05,453
How sweet!

922
01:38:47,821 --> 01:38:52,053
They've been asking me for years
why l don't write another novel.

923
01:38:53,221 --> 01:38:55,212
But look at these people.

924
01:38:56,221 --> 01:38:58,337
This wildlife!

925
01:38:59,301 --> 01:39:02,373
This is my life
and it's nothing.

926
01:39:05,661 --> 01:39:08,380
Flaubert wanted to write a book
about nothing but he failed,

927
01:39:08,501 --> 01:39:10,651
so could l do it?

928
01:39:17,341 --> 01:39:19,980
lt's nice.
Thanks, rascal.

929
01:39:33,421 --> 01:39:35,651
What inspired this exhibition?

930
01:39:36,621 --> 01:39:39,738
lt wasn't my idea
to do this photo exhibition.

931
01:39:39,861 --> 01:39:42,011
lt was my father's idea.

932
01:39:42,861 --> 01:39:46,092
When l was born, he starting taking
photos of me, every day.

933
01:39:46,301 --> 01:39:48,178
One photo per day.

934
01:39:48,741 --> 01:39:51,050
He never forgot, not even once.

935
01:39:51,781 --> 01:39:55,456
From the age of 14 upwards,
l continued.

936
01:39:56,141 --> 01:39:59,258
l photographed myself every day.

937
01:40:03,541 --> 01:40:05,133
Go ahead.

938
01:41:44,541 --> 01:41:47,214
- Cardinal!
- Your Eminence!

939
01:41:50,221 --> 01:41:52,689
Cardinal,
when will The Saint arrive in Rome?

940
01:41:52,821 --> 01:41:56,097
On Thursday,
but please don't call her The Saint.

941
01:41:56,221 --> 01:42:00,214
She is a Saint but not technically.

942
01:42:01,141 --> 01:42:03,939
Tell me something,
who is that cardinal?

943
01:42:04,061 --> 01:42:06,370
- That's Bellucci.
- Bellucci?

944
01:42:06,501 --> 01:42:08,253
- The one in line to be...
- Exactly.

945
01:42:08,381 --> 01:42:10,372
The papal throne awaits him.

946
01:42:10,581 --> 01:42:13,175
l met him at Giada Ricci's
carnival party.

947
01:42:13,301 --> 01:42:16,418
Rumour has it that he used to be
Europe's best exorcist.

948
01:42:16,541 --> 01:42:18,259
- Are you pulling my leg?
- No.

949
01:42:19,101 --> 01:42:20,853
l never joke about the devil.

950
01:42:21,381 --> 01:42:24,578
Do you know l'm very, very bored.

951
01:42:25,861 --> 01:42:28,580
We're having a great, great time.

952
01:42:29,261 --> 01:42:30,979
You cut up the duck.

953
01:42:31,101 --> 01:42:36,255
Cook it on a high flame
for 15 minutes.

954
01:42:36,381 --> 01:42:38,053
At that point...

955
01:42:38,221 --> 01:42:41,019
Cardinal, do you remember me?
Lello Cava.

956
01:42:41,141 --> 01:42:45,054
We met at Giada Ricci's party.
l was dressed as an escort.

957
01:42:45,501 --> 01:42:48,015
Come, they're starting
to serve lunch.

958
01:42:48,301 --> 01:42:51,737
l'd like you meet my writer friend,
Jep Gambardella.

959
01:42:52,421 --> 01:42:56,858
A writer!
This country needs writers.

960
01:42:56,981 --> 01:42:59,097
Actually l thought it was more
in need of priests.

961
01:42:59,261 --> 01:43:00,057
Help.

962
01:43:00,181 --> 01:43:03,332
- May l ask you a question?
- Of course, my dear man.

963
01:43:03,461 --> 01:43:06,373
Well, for some time now...

964
01:43:12,061 --> 01:43:14,859
from a spiritual point of view...

965
01:43:15,861 --> 01:43:20,173
- Skunk hunt?
- Of course, l'll lead the way!

966
01:43:20,301 --> 01:43:23,532
l know the Tebaldi grounds well.

967
01:43:29,301 --> 01:43:33,419
Jep Gambardella, the king
of socialites! You're losing it.

968
01:43:33,541 --> 01:43:38,740
l've been losing it for 40 years.
lt's a steady decline.

969
01:43:42,821 --> 01:43:48,373
Tell me something, Stefania.
Have we ever slept with each other?

970
01:43:49,101 --> 01:43:51,410
Of course not!

971
01:43:55,821 --> 01:43:59,973
That's an awfully big mistake!
We must make amends, immediately.

972
01:44:00,941 --> 01:44:02,932
ldiot.

973
01:44:05,501 --> 01:44:07,332
Thank goodness.

974
01:44:08,581 --> 01:44:11,653
We still have something nice
to do together.

975
01:44:14,581 --> 01:44:17,653
The future is marvellous, Stefania.

976
01:44:51,781 --> 01:44:54,693
To be honest, Catellani
hasn't had many brushed fabrics

977
01:44:54,821 --> 01:44:56,971
in recent years.

978
01:44:57,101 --> 01:45:00,377
ln my opinion, Rebecchi's still
the best tailor in Rome.

979
01:45:03,861 --> 01:45:06,739
- Who are you?
- A hard-working man.

980
01:45:06,861 --> 01:45:11,651
One who, while you play the artist
and have fun with your friends,

981
01:45:11,781 --> 01:45:14,056
keeps this country going.

982
01:45:14,181 --> 01:45:16,775
l keep this country going,

983
01:45:16,901 --> 01:45:19,574
but many people
haven't understood that yet.

984
01:45:22,261 --> 01:45:26,777
lmagine that, Dadina,
Giulio Moneta was my neighbour.

985
01:45:26,901 --> 01:45:32,259
One of the world's 10 most wanted
men and l never noticed.

986
01:45:32,381 --> 01:45:35,134
You've changed,
you're always thinking.

987
01:45:37,581 --> 01:45:39,856
Maybe l should do what Romano did.

988
01:45:40,741 --> 01:45:42,936
l'm not fit for this life
or this city.

989
01:45:43,061 --> 01:45:47,532
Nobody's fit for shit, dammit.
Take it from the queen of misfits.

990
01:45:48,861 --> 01:45:51,329
Everything around me is dying.

991
01:45:52,301 --> 01:45:55,418
People who are younger than me,
things...

992
01:45:56,261 --> 01:45:57,455
All before my eyes and l...

993
01:45:57,581 --> 01:46:01,017
And you're suffering.
And you don't understand.

994
01:46:08,741 --> 01:46:11,175
How's the soup, Little Jep?

995
01:46:13,741 --> 01:46:15,459
The soup's good.

996
01:46:17,661 --> 01:46:21,495
Why did you call me Little Jep? No
one's called me that for centuries.

997
01:46:21,621 --> 01:46:23,896
Because a friend,
every now and again,

998
01:46:24,061 --> 01:46:27,497
needs to make their friend
feel like they did as a child.

999
01:46:29,461 --> 01:46:31,975
How can l make you feel
like a little girl?

1000
01:46:32,101 --> 01:46:34,934
You don't need to, l feel
like a little girl every day!

1001
01:46:35,061 --> 01:46:38,610
l've seen the world from
their viewpoint for 60 years.

1002
01:46:39,901 --> 01:46:42,051
You know Sister Maria,
the missionary,

1003
01:46:42,701 --> 01:46:44,180
the one they call the Saint?

1004
01:46:44,301 --> 01:46:48,135
Yes, she's coming to Rome
to receive some honour.

1005
01:46:48,261 --> 01:46:51,537
Exactly. ln all her life,
she's only given three interviews.

1006
01:46:51,661 --> 01:46:55,176
-Yours will be memorable.
-Yeah sure, think of Giulio Moneta!

1007
01:46:55,301 --> 01:46:59,089
This is different.
She studied in ltaly

1008
01:46:59,221 --> 01:47:02,133
and speaks ltalian.
She read your book and loved it.

1009
01:47:02,741 --> 01:47:04,060
She wants to meet you

1010
01:47:04,181 --> 01:47:06,376
so l organised a dinner party
at your house tomorrow.

1011
01:47:06,501 --> 01:47:09,971
- Did l do well?
- You did very well.

1012
01:49:07,981 --> 01:49:11,656
Tomorrow l'll have the honour
of dining with her.

1013
01:49:11,781 --> 01:49:14,215
- At the Holy Father's?
- No.

1014
01:49:14,381 --> 01:49:15,894
No, at Jep Gambardella's.

1015
01:49:16,661 --> 01:49:22,418
You see, the Pope even invited
the enclosed nuns.

1016
01:49:56,181 --> 01:49:58,695
Sisters, sisters, sisters!

1017
01:49:59,621 --> 01:50:01,452
Sisters, sisters...
Yes, perfect!

1018
01:50:03,861 --> 01:50:06,170
Ah, the Red Cross nurses!
Well-toned!

1019
01:50:06,341 --> 01:50:09,139
Okay, great...
What handsome young men!

1020
01:50:09,661 --> 01:50:10,935
Great!

1021
01:50:11,501 --> 01:50:12,900
Let's go!

1022
01:50:16,581 --> 01:50:18,537
The Saint's assistant called me.

1023
01:50:18,661 --> 01:50:22,415
The Saint would like Count and
Countess Odescalchi to come too,

1024
01:50:22,541 --> 01:50:24,611
as they treated her like a sister
when she lived in ltaly.

1025
01:50:24,741 --> 01:50:28,017
- Do you know them? - Of course,
but they are not in Rome.

1026
01:50:28,141 --> 01:50:31,417
All the nobles are in London,
at Philip's great-niece's wedding.

1027
01:50:31,541 --> 01:50:34,533
Let's call the Colonnas of Reggio.

1028
01:50:34,661 --> 01:50:36,458
The nobles for hire?
They're dead.

1029
01:50:37,341 --> 01:50:39,059
Nonsense, they're immortal.

1030
01:50:39,181 --> 01:50:42,696
The Saint won't even notice,
70 years have gone by!

1031
01:50:43,421 --> 01:50:45,491
This piece of furniture
looks great...

1032
01:50:45,661 --> 01:50:50,257
-Who would've thought!
-lt looks great, like a new bathroom!

1033
01:50:54,701 --> 01:50:56,771
Count Colonna speaking.

1034
01:50:57,381 --> 01:50:59,690
Yes, we are available.

1035
01:51:00,701 --> 01:51:02,259
For tonight.

1036
01:51:02,461 --> 01:51:05,976
Our rate is 250 euros per person
for the evening.

1037
01:51:06,701 --> 01:51:09,818
Plus the cost of the car hire.

1038
01:51:10,901 --> 01:51:15,338
This would be somewhat
humiliating for us...

1039
01:51:16,061 --> 01:51:20,418
We are willing to be hired
as the Colonnas of Reggio.

1040
01:51:21,141 --> 01:51:25,214
But as for pretending to be
the Odescalchis...

1041
01:51:25,581 --> 01:51:26,775
l don't know...

1042
01:51:28,061 --> 01:51:30,734
We were at war for two centuries.

1043
01:51:31,501 --> 01:51:33,298
l feel it's immoral.

1044
01:51:33,741 --> 01:51:37,939
Cut at least twelve pieces
of rabbit!

1045
01:51:38,301 --> 01:51:41,737
Set aside the kidneys, liver,
head...

1046
01:51:41,941 --> 01:51:43,818
Gently brown.

1047
01:51:44,661 --> 01:51:47,255
Don't forget thyme,
laurel leaves, rosemary...

1048
01:51:47,381 --> 01:51:51,579
Then red wine, Ligurian olives...
pine nuts.

1049
01:51:52,461 --> 01:51:55,419
And after an hour,
you have Ligurian-style rabbit!

1050
01:51:56,101 --> 01:51:58,410
Sister Maria, what convent
are you staying at?

1051
01:51:58,541 --> 01:52:02,329
Actually, we're at the Hassler Hotel
at the Spanish Steps.

1052
01:52:03,301 --> 01:52:05,895
To be honest, Sister Maria
finds it uncomfortable.

1053
01:52:06,021 --> 01:52:08,489
Never heard the Hassler
described as uncomfortable!

1054
01:52:09,101 --> 01:52:10,534
lt's very comfortable

1055
01:52:10,661 --> 01:52:13,812
but Sister Maria isn't used
to sleeping in a bed.

1056
01:52:14,381 --> 01:52:17,498
She sleeps on the floor,
in a cardboard bed.

1057
01:52:17,621 --> 01:52:19,612
Do you have any visits planned?

1058
01:52:19,741 --> 01:52:21,572
Sister Maria will climb

1059
01:52:21,701 --> 01:52:23,851
St John's Basilica's Scala Sancta
on her knees.

1060
01:52:24,141 --> 01:52:26,655
- Have you?
- l'd have liked to, but...

1061
01:52:26,781 --> 01:52:29,614
l have a bad knee...

1062
01:52:29,741 --> 01:52:32,209
Orthopedic problems
are unimportant,

1063
01:52:32,421 --> 01:52:37,017
compared to the partial indulgence
granted by the Scala Sancta.

1064
01:52:37,141 --> 01:52:41,657
That's true! Another speciality
of mine is lamb with...

1065
01:52:41,781 --> 01:52:44,739
Does Sister Maria still help
the sick?

1066
01:52:45,021 --> 01:52:47,979
22 hours a day, every day.

1067
01:52:48,141 --> 01:52:51,497
She washes them, feeds them...
You ought to see her.

1068
01:52:51,661 --> 01:52:54,129
Despite her age,
she doesn't walk, she runs.

1069
01:52:54,261 --> 01:53:00,257
Now she's tired, but that's because
she's not with her patients.

1070
01:53:00,421 --> 01:53:01,934
How old is she?

1071
01:53:02,061 --> 01:53:03,972
She'll be 104 in October.

1072
01:53:04,141 --> 01:53:06,291
- That's impressive.
- l thought she was older!

1073
01:53:06,461 --> 01:53:11,216
Longevity too, like all things,
is not accidental.

1074
01:53:11,381 --> 01:53:13,895
About Sister Maria's interview
with Jep...

1075
01:53:14,021 --> 01:53:18,970
Her interview?
There must be a mix-up...

1076
01:53:19,101 --> 01:53:21,899
Sister Maria hasn't given
any interviews since 197 1,

1077
01:53:22,021 --> 01:53:24,660
after the reason
for her mission in Chad,

1078
01:53:24,781 --> 01:53:27,420
was misunderstood by some.

1079
01:53:27,901 --> 01:53:30,893
Of course, but considering
her admiration for Jep's work...

1080
01:53:31,061 --> 01:53:33,336
You told me she enjoyed
''The Human Apparatus''.

1081
01:53:33,501 --> 01:53:36,618
She found it beautiful and fierce.

1082
01:53:36,741 --> 01:53:38,652
Like the world of men.

1083
01:53:38,781 --> 01:53:41,375
Great! There would be no risk
of any misunderstanding,

1084
01:53:41,541 --> 01:53:43,372
Sister Maria can review the text...

1085
01:53:43,581 --> 01:53:46,573
- No, l'm sorry.
- Don't insist.

1086
01:53:46,741 --> 01:53:50,017
l don't wish to raise
any false hopes,

1087
01:53:50,141 --> 01:53:53,577
there's absolutely
no question of any interview.

1088
01:53:53,701 --> 01:53:56,534
Sorry, but why do
you always answer?

1089
01:53:56,661 --> 01:53:58,697
Why not let Sister Maria talk?

1090
01:54:17,141 --> 01:54:19,450
Madam...

1091
01:54:22,141 --> 01:54:26,134
l took a vow of poverty.

1092
01:54:27,901 --> 01:54:32,213
And you can't talk about poverty...

1093
01:54:33,861 --> 01:54:35,533
you have to live it.

1094
01:54:46,421 --> 01:54:50,255
Such true and real words!
Powerful words!

1095
01:54:54,221 --> 01:54:56,212
Do you need anything, madam?

1096
01:54:56,861 --> 01:54:59,136
- She needs the bathroom.
- lt's on the left.

1097
01:54:59,301 --> 01:55:01,974
The change of diet
isn't good for her.

1098
01:55:02,101 --> 01:55:08,290
Sister Maria, in Mali, only eats
40 grams of plant roots a day.

1099
01:55:08,581 --> 01:55:11,857
Me too sometimes, in the evening,
as a light meal,

1100
01:55:11,981 --> 01:55:15,417
l have some splendid
roots with lemon.

1101
01:55:15,541 --> 01:55:18,658
You clean the roots
by scraping them with a knife

1102
01:55:18,861 --> 01:55:22,171
and you cut them into small
chunks...

1103
01:55:22,381 --> 01:55:25,578
Cardinal, remember when we met
at that wedding?

1104
01:55:25,781 --> 01:55:27,453
You were there too...

1105
01:55:28,941 --> 01:55:33,969
l felt the need to ask you
about matters close to my heart.

1106
01:55:34,221 --> 01:55:36,689
Matters regarding faith...

1107
01:55:37,021 --> 01:55:40,696
regarding the strength
of spirituality...

1108
01:55:41,021 --> 01:55:43,012
But then you got distracted.

1109
01:55:43,181 --> 01:55:44,580
You can ask me now.

1110
01:55:46,461 --> 01:55:50,010
- No, l don't see the point.
- Why?

1111
01:55:50,141 --> 01:55:55,738
l'd be very disappointed to discover
that you have no answers.

1112
01:55:56,221 --> 01:55:58,815
l'm only saying
it's a possibility...

1113
01:55:58,941 --> 01:56:00,818
l think that...

1114
01:56:06,981 --> 01:56:08,096
Never mind...

1115
01:56:13,381 --> 01:56:15,019
l apologize for earlier.

1116
01:56:15,221 --> 01:56:18,736
There is one question
l really want to ask you.

1117
01:56:19,821 --> 01:56:22,381
Are the rumours about you true?

1118
01:56:23,421 --> 01:56:25,298
That you were a truly great...

1119
01:56:27,341 --> 01:56:29,013
exorcist?

1120
01:56:56,861 --> 01:56:58,692
Sister Maria...

1121
01:56:59,221 --> 01:57:00,700
Sister Maria!

1122
01:57:02,661 --> 01:57:04,219
- Sister Maria!
- Saint...

1123
01:57:04,341 --> 01:57:06,172
- Have you seen her?
- No, she's not there.

1124
01:57:08,541 --> 01:57:10,259
- Sister Maria!
- Saint...

1125
01:57:10,381 --> 01:57:11,609
Sister Maria!

1126
01:57:11,741 --> 01:57:12,776
Saint!

1127
01:57:12,901 --> 01:57:15,574
She's called Sister Maria.

1128
01:57:15,701 --> 01:57:17,339
Sister Maria...

1129
01:57:17,461 --> 01:57:20,259
Where has that bitch got to?

1130
01:57:44,301 --> 01:57:46,132
Sister Maria!

1131
01:57:48,941 --> 01:57:50,897
Sister Maria!

1132
01:57:53,341 --> 01:57:54,694
My goodness!

1133
01:57:56,061 --> 01:57:57,813
My goodness!

1134
01:58:28,861 --> 01:58:31,694
Come, Elisabetta, let's go to bed.

1135
01:58:31,861 --> 01:58:34,739
You go ahead, l'm going upstairs
for a moment.

1136
01:58:35,981 --> 01:58:38,051
Don't be late.

1137
01:59:49,621 --> 01:59:52,419
ln this room, in 1930,

1138
01:59:52,541 --> 01:59:55,931
Princess Antonietta gave birth
to her only daughter,

1139
01:59:56,061 --> 01:59:58,256
Elisabetta Colonna of Reggio.

1140
01:59:58,621 --> 02:00:01,658
The princess died
after giving birth.

1141
02:00:01,781 --> 02:00:04,659
Young Elisabetta,
in these opulent rooms,

1142
02:00:04,781 --> 02:00:07,534
had a happy and carefree
childhood.

1143
02:00:07,661 --> 02:00:12,371
But shortly after, the financial
hardship endured by Prince Erminio,

1144
02:00:12,981 --> 02:00:15,734
forced him to sell the property.

1145
02:00:51,181 --> 02:00:53,217
They're migrating west...

1146
02:00:53,381 --> 02:00:57,294
but now they are resting.

1147
02:01:10,581 --> 02:01:12,219
Did you know

1148
02:01:13,141 --> 02:01:17,419
that l know the Christian names...

1149
02:01:18,021 --> 02:01:21,980
of all of these birds?

1150
02:01:29,381 --> 02:01:30,496
Why...

1151
02:01:32,261 --> 02:01:35,697
did you never write another book?

1152
02:01:41,861 --> 02:01:43,613
l was looking for the great beauty,

1153
02:01:45,701 --> 02:01:47,339
but...

1154
02:01:50,461 --> 02:01:51,655
l didn't find it.

1155
02:01:53,501 --> 02:01:55,219
Do you know...

1156
02:01:56,021 --> 02:01:57,534
why...

1157
02:01:58,221 --> 02:02:01,133
l only eat roots?

1158
02:02:06,461 --> 02:02:08,053
No, why?

1159
02:02:14,981 --> 02:02:19,372
Because roots are important.

1160
02:04:48,541 --> 02:04:52,295
Now there's something
l want to show you.

1161
02:05:51,141 --> 02:05:54,611
This is how it always ends.
With death.

1162
02:05:55,821 --> 02:05:59,052
But first there was life.

1163
02:05:59,541 --> 02:06:03,420
Hidden beneath the blah, blah, blah.

1164
02:06:05,781 --> 02:06:10,536
lt is all settled beneath
the chitter chatter and the noise.

1165
02:06:11,341 --> 02:06:14,697
Silence and sentiment.

1166
02:06:15,181 --> 02:06:18,173
Emotion and fear.

1167
02:06:19,381 --> 02:06:24,694
The haggard, inconstant
flashes of beauty.

1168
02:06:25,421 --> 02:06:30,495
And then the wretched squalor
and miserable humanity.

1169
02:06:31,621 --> 02:06:36,012
All buried under the cover of the
embarrassment of being in the world.

1170
02:06:41,221 --> 02:06:44,736
Beyond there is what lies beyond.

1171
02:06:45,741 --> 02:06:49,131
l don't deal
with what lies beyond.

1172
02:06:50,221 --> 02:06:55,011
Therefore...
let this novel begin.

1173
02:06:55,861 --> 02:06:59,695
After all... it's just a trick.

1174
02:07:00,661 --> 02:07:04,336
Yes, it's just a trick.
