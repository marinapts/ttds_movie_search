1
00:03:33,793 --> 00:03:34,953
And, here they come.

2
00:03:52,445 --> 00:03:54,470
Stepping out onto the field.

3
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:59,518
ln Europe and the world over,
this runner...

4
00:03:59,619 --> 00:04:02,713
... is known as the lndian saint.

5
00:04:03,056 --> 00:04:04,921
He is lndia's Milkha Singh.

6
00:04:05,058 --> 00:04:07,390
Milkha Singh

7
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:07,242
lndia's Milkha Singh
still holds the world record.

8
00:05:07,387 --> 00:05:15,317
Can he win gold for
lndia in the 400m race?

9
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:23,701
On your mark.

10
00:05:27,607 --> 00:05:28,699
Set.

11
00:05:30,644 --> 00:05:33,078
The historic race has begun.

12
00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:38,276
Milkha Singh leads...

13
00:05:38,385 --> 00:05:39,374
lt's time.

14
00:05:42,722 --> 00:05:46,886
... will this be
lndia's first gold?

15
00:05:51,297 --> 00:05:57,361
At 200mts the gold
is virtually in his pocket.

16
00:05:57,737 --> 00:05:59,034
Run Milkha!

17
00:06:00,306 --> 00:06:01,637
Run!

18
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:11,139
Run!

19
00:06:51,224 --> 00:06:56,355
Why did he look back?

20
00:08:26,653 --> 00:08:27,642
Hello?

21
00:08:29,556 --> 00:08:30,750
Hello, Milkha?

22
00:08:34,394 --> 00:08:35,383
Hello, Milkha?

23
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:38,253
Hello, Milkha?

24
00:08:43,369 --> 00:08:44,563
What happened?

25
00:08:51,377 --> 00:08:55,143
Ranvir, after the
Rome Olympics loss...

26
00:08:55,582 --> 00:08:59,109
l understand Milkha's mental state.

27
00:08:59,752 --> 00:09:02,482
But you see...

28
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:06,081
... our Prime Minister and Pakistan's
President General Ayub Khan...

29
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:08,923
... have great interest in
this contest. What do we tell them?

30
00:09:09,128 --> 00:09:12,529
The announcements are made.

31
00:09:12,732 --> 00:09:17,294
Milkha is our star. lf he refuses,
it'll send the wrong signal.

32
00:09:17,437 --> 00:09:18,870
Wrong signal?

33
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:22,631
lt's about the upcoming
lndia-Pakistan Games

34
00:09:22,842 --> 00:09:25,333
Oh yes, yes. Please sit.

35
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:30,172
These games aren't
just games but a means...

36
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:33,314
... to bring our countries closer.

37
00:09:33,553 --> 00:09:36,886
All the arrangements have been made,
sir. Everything is on it track?

38
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:40,781
But?

39
00:09:41,794 --> 00:09:45,025
Our star Milkha refuses
to go to Pakistan.

40
00:09:46,532 --> 00:09:47,999
Convince him.

41
00:09:49,168 --> 00:09:54,470
We're trying. But since
he lost the Rome Olympics...

42
00:09:54,574 --> 00:09:56,565
You win some, you lose some.

43
00:09:56,643 --> 00:09:57,735
Mr. Prime Minister,

44
00:09:58,111 --> 00:10:01,547
Pardon me. My name is Ranvir Singh.

45
00:10:02,081 --> 00:10:03,708
Milkha Singh's coach.

46
00:10:04,317 --> 00:10:05,807
This isn't about losing in Rome.

47
00:10:07,887 --> 00:10:09,855
He refuses to go to Pakistan...

48
00:10:11,024 --> 00:10:13,857
... for personal reasons.

49
00:10:16,496 --> 00:10:17,690
Mr. Wadhwa...

50
00:10:18,298 --> 00:10:19,890
... take Ranvir Singh...

51
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,831
... and go and talk to Milkha.

52
00:10:23,303 --> 00:10:24,292
Good morning, sir.

53
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,201
Oh good morning come.

54
00:10:27,874 --> 00:10:31,071
Sir, this is Gurudev Singh.
l've told you about him.

55
00:10:31,311 --> 00:10:32,300
Hello...

56
00:10:32,578 --> 00:10:34,443
How are you, sir? - Very well.

57
00:10:34,981 --> 00:10:35,970
Come in.

58
00:10:39,085 --> 00:10:46,218
The Delhi to Chandigarh Amrapali Express
is about to leave from platform no. 1.

59
00:10:46,326 --> 00:10:48,556
Milkha Singh listens to him...

60
00:10:49,262 --> 00:10:52,595
... so l requested him to come too.

61
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:54,423
Thanks for coming, Mr.
Gurudev Singh.

62
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:57,927
l hope you can
help persuade Milkha.

63
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:05,534
Read this?

64
00:11:08,047 --> 00:11:09,571
l will not go to Pakistan.

65
00:11:12,952 --> 00:11:16,479
What is the reason?

66
00:11:19,325 --> 00:11:20,815
lt's a long story, sir.

67
00:11:21,094 --> 00:11:23,289
Ourjourney to
Chandigarh is long too.

68
00:11:28,401 --> 00:11:32,497
l first met Milkha 6 years ago.
ln 1954...

69
00:11:34,007 --> 00:11:36,874
... at the Secunderabad
Army Regiment Centre.

70
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,772

71
00:11:38,845 --> 00:11:39,834
Sir!

72
00:11:40,346 --> 00:11:41,973

Cadet Sujit Chawla. - Sir.

75
00:11:48,087 --> 00:11:51,853
Every year young
men enlist in the Army.

76
00:11:53,059 --> 00:11:54,583
Milkha Singh was one of them.

77
00:11:55,795 --> 00:11:57,558
Recruit Sahil. - Sir.

78
00:11:58,131 --> 00:11:59,530
Recruit Suresh Kumar

79
00:12:03,202 --> 00:12:04,191
Suresh Kumar?

80
00:12:07,774 --> 00:12:08,832

81
00:12:09,008 --> 00:12:09,838

82
00:12:09,942 --> 00:12:10,931
Yes, sir.

83
00:12:13,613 --> 00:12:14,739
Two Milkha Singhs?

84
00:12:16,682 --> 00:12:18,149
l'm Suresh Kumar, sir!

85
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,785
What took you so long?

86
00:12:22,088 --> 00:12:23,077
Sorry, sir!

87
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:29,160
You have a shrill voice.
Why did you join the army?

88
00:12:29,695 --> 00:12:30,753
To fight, sir!

89
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:34,493
To fight? Or sing lullabies?
Can you roar at the enemy?

90
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:36,927
l can, sir! - Let's hear you.

91
00:12:37,537 --> 00:12:40,028
Attack!

Silence!

00:12:43,576 --> 00:12:44,565
No laughing!

94
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,741
He can roar. He has balls.

95
00:12:49,482 --> 00:12:51,541
Enemy, l'm coming!

96
00:12:54,587 --> 00:12:56,487
From now you're no
longer Suresh Kumar...

97
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,216
... but Miss Suresh

98
00:12:58,825 --> 00:12:59,985
Damned if you do...

99
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:02,084
... damned if you don't.

100
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:05,719
Who spoke?

101
00:13:08,734 --> 00:13:09,792
Who spoke?

102
00:13:17,276 --> 00:13:18,265
You?

103
00:13:21,013 --> 00:13:22,037

104
00:13:28,588 --> 00:13:29,680
So, you did!

105

Yes, sir.

106
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:34,282
You think l'm a clown?

107
00:13:34,694 --> 00:13:35,683
No, sir.

108
00:13:35,862 --> 00:13:37,853
That you are a hero?
- No, sir.

109
00:13:39,132 --> 00:13:40,224
No butting in.

110
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,558
Got it?

111
00:13:42,301 --> 00:13:43,427

No wives in sight.

115
00:13:56,582 --> 00:13:57,606
He forgot mug.

116
00:13:58,918 --> 00:13:59,646
You said something?

117
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:00,651
Sir, this mug.

00:14:02,822 --> 00:14:09,057
This is to drink, bathe and wash.

Remember. Your field of action,

00:15:01,948 --> 00:15:04,143
And your duty is your penance.

135
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,082
He's always yelling.

Do this! Do that!

137
00:15:11,657 --> 00:15:15,115

There will be a race tomorrow.

00:19:07,026 --> 00:19:10,223
The centre Coach Gurudev
Singh will explain.

At ease!

190
00:19:15,134 --> 00:19:17,261
My name is Gurudev Singh.

00:19:18,771 --> 00:19:22,571
The lndian Army is
ready at all times ...

192
00:19:23,175 --> 00:19:26,235
... to serve and
protect the country.

193
00:19:27,379 --> 00:19:28,607
Besides that...

194
00:19:29,348 --> 00:19:32,374
... the lndian army
has also given lndia...

195
00:19:32,852 --> 00:19:35,047
... its' finest sportsmen.

196
00:19:36,288 --> 00:19:37,312

198
00:19:42,061 --> 00:19:43,426
... six miles long.

The ten fastest...

00:19:48,634 --> 00:19:51,797
... will be personally
trained by me.

201
00:19:53,005 --> 00:19:54,939
To compete in the
coming brigade games...

202
00:19:56,408 --> 00:19:58,308
... representing our unit.

203
00:19:59,078 --> 00:20:02,946
Have any of you run before?

204
00:20:06,185 --> 00:20:07,174
When?

205
00:20:07,419 --> 00:20:10,877
A mad dog once chased me.
l ran all the way home.

206
00:20:11,824 --> 00:20:12,813
Quiet!

207
00:20:14,193 --> 00:20:15,160
And you?

208
00:20:15,227 --> 00:20:17,559
Much the same story, sir.

209
00:20:17,863 --> 00:20:21,492
You morons. That's not
the kind of running l mean.

210
00:20:22,668 --> 00:20:24,465
This is a contest.

211
00:20:25,304 --> 00:20:27,829
To get ahead of the others.

212
00:20:28,774 --> 00:20:29,706
Any questions?

213
00:20:29,808 --> 00:20:31,105
No, sir!

214
00:20:31,944 --> 00:20:33,070
One more thing...

215
00:20:33,646 --> 00:20:38,083
... no more fatigue duty
for the ten best runners.

216
00:20:39,518 --> 00:20:40,985
A special diet too...

00:20:41,687 --> 00:20:44,679
... a glass of milk
and two raw eggs.

218
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:46,780
Attention!

219
00:20:48,127 --> 00:20:49,116
Disperse!

220
00:20:49,328 --> 00:20:51,592
One-two-three-one..

221
00:20:51,664 --> 00:20:52,756
Hail lndia!

222
00:20:55,834 --> 00:20:59,031

223
00:21:00,773 --> 00:21:02,604
We have to win.

224
00:21:02,675 --> 00:21:04,973
Hear that?
No fatigue duty for the top ten.

225
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:09,146
No cutting grass.
l'll run like life depends on it!

226
00:21:09,582 --> 00:21:13,712
All l can think about is the milk.

227
00:22:02,568 --> 00:22:04,559
Taran, put in all your strength...

228
00:22:05,404 --> 00:22:07,167
... you have to get
your fatigue excused.

229
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:08,428
Come on!

230
00:22:59,925 --> 00:23:02,325
Why are you sitting here?

231
00:23:02,828 --> 00:23:05,956
Stomach cramps. Can't move.

232
00:23:06,565 --> 00:23:08,192
Think of the milk.

233
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:09,656
Come on.

234
00:23:12,004 --> 00:23:16,964
Milk! Milk!

235
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:23,378
Milk! Milk!

236
00:23:25,084 --> 00:23:28,679
Milk! Milk!

237
00:23:36,562 --> 00:23:38,530
Run to beat everyone.

238
00:23:39,631 --> 00:23:41,462
Run to come first.

239
00:23:44,069 --> 00:23:45,400
Young man!

240
00:23:46,238 --> 00:23:48,035
You ran well.

241
00:23:48,674 --> 00:23:49,800
What happened?

242
00:23:51,176 --> 00:23:52,575
Stomach cramps, sir.

243
00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:56,575
We'll work on that.

244
00:23:57,382 --> 00:23:58,371
Yes, sir!

245
00:23:59,485 --> 00:24:00,315
Come on.

246
00:24:00,352 --> 00:24:03,913
Eggs and milk!

247
00:24:17,102 --> 00:24:19,161
lt's back to fatigue duty for me...

248
00:24:23,275 --> 00:24:24,799
lt's ok, Taran.

249
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:28,542

Drink it.

00:24:35,287 --> 00:24:36,276
you drink it.

253
00:24:36,622 --> 00:24:38,647
You drinking or me,
it's the same thing.

254
00:24:58,911 --> 00:25:01,846
What about you?
- You love milk.

255
00:25:02,247 --> 00:25:04,238
You drinking or me, same thing.

256
00:25:04,483 --> 00:25:05,711
Then l'll finish all of it.

257
00:25:05,784 --> 00:25:07,945
Shameless boy!

258
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,384
Little devil!

Here you go.

00:26:04,042 --> 00:26:05,509
No holding back when you eat.

273
00:26:05,978 --> 00:26:07,536
lshri, don't you feed your husband?

274
00:26:07,746 --> 00:26:09,373
He's become so thin.

275
00:26:11,116 --> 00:26:12,105
Milkha.

276
00:26:13,018 --> 00:26:15,953

English at school.

00:26:16,788 --> 00:26:18,881
Yes, brother-in-law.

00:27:03,001 --> 00:27:04,866
King cat mouse in the house.

291
00:27:07,139 --> 00:27:09,437
My Milkhu speaks such good English.

292
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,403
A proper Englishman.

293
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,248
That's why l send him to school.

294
00:27:18,116 --> 00:27:19,708
So he can be a somebody.

295
00:27:20,719 --> 00:27:24,052
What will you be when you grow up?

296
00:27:24,623 --> 00:27:26,557
A soldier, father.

297
00:27:26,625 --> 00:27:32,757
My little soldier!
Milkha Singh, Salute!

298
00:27:48,213 --> 00:27:49,805
You make us late everyday.

We'll be on time.

300
00:27:55,988 --> 00:28:01,790
The teacher will cane our backside.

301
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,086
And then?

302
00:28:03,328 --> 00:28:04,317
Red Bums!

303
00:28:04,463 --> 00:28:12,598
Red are tomatoes, red is the maiden's
veil, red like Sampreet's bum.

Red are tomatoes, red is the maiden's

Milkha's red bum.

317
00:28:55,814 --> 00:28:57,338
No, yours!

318
00:28:57,416 --> 00:28:59,543
Sampreet's red bum.

319
00:28:59,618 --> 00:29:01,916
Your bum will turn red too,

00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,954
Sampreet's red bum!

321
00:29:04,089 --> 00:29:05,249
Your red bum.

322
00:29:16,234 --> 00:29:17,428
Stop.

323
00:29:21,006 --> 00:29:23,167
My feet are on fire.

324
00:29:24,676 --> 00:29:26,109
Come in the shade.

325
00:29:26,511 --> 00:29:29,139
l have to reach home.

326
00:29:29,314 --> 00:29:33,250
Let's wait till it's cooler.

327
00:29:33,351 --> 00:29:35,182
We'll run across the dunes.

328
00:29:35,253 --> 00:29:38,017
You nuts? Your feet will roast.

329
00:29:38,123 --> 00:29:39,750
l'm off!

330
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:45,326
Hey... hey...
Listen to me, Sardar.

... you will now have to run 400...

333
00:30:45,257 --> 00:30:48,158
... 400 means 400 meters.

334
00:30:49,628 --> 00:30:54,122
Moron! Run one
lap around the track.

335
00:30:54,766 --> 00:30:55,755
Just one?

336
00:30:56,601 --> 00:30:59,729
Guruji, l can easily do 20 laps.

337
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:02,106
Not 20!

338
00:31:03,008 --> 00:31:06,910
Put the effort of 20 laps in one.

339
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:09,068
Yes sir.

340
00:31:10,382 --> 00:31:11,781
Remember one thing.

These races are very important.

342
00:31:16,388 --> 00:31:21,849
The first three will
compete in the Brigade games.

343
00:31:22,827 --> 00:31:28,424
They'll represent the Army.

344
00:31:29,467 --> 00:31:31,059
Guru sir where are you going?

345
00:31:31,403 --> 00:31:35,396
How are you?

346
00:31:37,242 --> 00:31:39,210
How about some tea, butter milk?

347
00:31:39,311 --> 00:31:40,903
Sure.

348
00:31:41,346 --> 00:31:43,644
Milkha, l'll see you in a bit.

349
00:31:43,815 --> 00:31:46,841
Yes. - Come on.

350
00:32:18,183 --> 00:32:21,152
How are you, Taimoor? - Rana, sir.

00:32:22,954 --> 00:32:24,148
You will lose this time.

352
00:32:24,222 --> 00:32:26,952
How are your preparations? - Good.

353
00:32:30,829 --> 00:32:33,389
Taimoor, how are your preparations?

354
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:35,359
Very good.

00:32:45,877 --> 00:32:47,640
Where did you get that blazer?

356
00:32:49,047 --> 00:32:50,036
Why?

357
00:32:50,348 --> 00:32:52,873
l can see people who
wear one are more respected.

358
00:32:53,618 --> 00:32:54,983

359
00:32:56,054 --> 00:32:57,351

375
00:35:15,727 --> 00:35:17,388
Champion Milkha Singh.

376
00:35:22,534 --> 00:35:23,899

Stealing my blazer?

Don't call me a thief.

382
00:35:35,346 --> 00:35:36,472
What else are you?

383
00:35:36,581 --> 00:35:38,344
He's been eyeing it all day.

384
00:35:38,483 --> 00:35:39,745
He's a thief.

385
00:35:40,485 --> 00:35:41,713
Report him.

386
00:35:43,054 --> 00:35:44,521
Think it's your pop's?

387

Get him suspended.

388
00:35:46,357 --> 00:35:47,449
He's a thief.

389
00:35:49,461 --> 00:35:50,689
Acting smart eh?

390
00:35:50,995 --> 00:35:51,984
Strip the bugger.

391
00:35:53,364 --> 00:35:55,195

393
00:36:00,071 --> 00:36:01,766

We caught him stealing.

Why did you wear his blazer?

You want one?

404
00:36:57,295 --> 00:36:58,489
An lndia team blazer?

00:37:00,031 --> 00:37:01,396
Just like that, eh?

406
00:37:03,034 --> 00:37:04,626
Hey, it's not that easy.

407
00:37:04,736 --> 00:37:05,930
You must earn it.

408
00:37:06,237 --> 00:37:09,968
Work bloody hard for it.
Be worthy of it.

409
00:37:17,148 --> 00:37:20,777
You really want the blazer?

410

00:37:41,406 --> 00:37:43,169
Have you seen him run?

416
00:37:43,274 --> 00:37:46,903
He's like a bullet.

417
00:37:47,111 --> 00:37:48,305
Have you the guts?

418
00:37:48,947 --> 00:37:53,441
Have you the guts?

419
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:55,308
Yes, l do.

420
00:38:01,492 --> 00:38:06,953
You could try tomorrow.

421
00:38:13,972 --> 00:38:17,100
You will beat a thousand
Sher Singh Ranas.

422
00:38:55,813 --> 00:38:57,144
On your mark.

423
00:39:03,121 --> 00:39:04,110
Set.

424
00:39:35,319 --> 00:39:38,846
Come on, gallop!

425
00:39:59,477 --> 00:40:03,914
Well done! Go! Go!

426
00:41:30,568 --> 00:41:31,865
You ran well.

427
00:41:32,203 --> 00:41:34,296
You'd be first if
it wasn't for the stone.

428
00:41:35,807 --> 00:41:38,071
Gurudev, l choose him too.

429
00:41:38,576 --> 00:41:40,601
Train him well.
- Yes sir

430
00:41:40,912 --> 00:41:42,038
Well done!

431
00:41:44,682 --> 00:41:50,143
Every time the stone won't
be so big that it comes in notice.

432
00:41:51,489 --> 00:41:53,013
You must work hard...

433
00:41:53,858 --> 00:41:57,191
... so nothing comes in your way.

434
00:41:58,796 --> 00:41:59,785
Yes, sir.

435
00:42:00,198 --> 00:42:02,758
Come on.

436
00:42:05,736 --> 00:42:07,601
Milkha Singh was a natural.

437
00:42:08,272 --> 00:42:11,867
A gifted athlete.

438
00:42:12,276 --> 00:42:14,369
We merely honed the diamond.

439
00:42:15,613 --> 00:42:20,277
All that is very
interesting, but...

440
00:42:20,551 --> 00:42:23,952
... l still don't see
why he won't go to Pakistan.

441
00:42:24,355 --> 00:42:27,381
Mr. Secretary, in 1947...

442
00:42:28,893 --> 00:42:32,590
... millions were
celebrating lndia's freedom.

443
00:42:33,898 --> 00:42:38,198
While others were mourning
lndia's bloody partition.

444
00:42:39,036 --> 00:42:42,597
Millions became refugees.

445
00:42:47,578 --> 00:42:49,068
Milkha was among them.

446
00:42:49,847 --> 00:42:53,783
His new village fell on the other
side of the border, in Pakistan.

447
00:42:55,253 --> 00:42:59,212
He was just a kid.
10-12 years or so...

448
00:43:00,825 --> 00:43:05,626
He came to Delhi,
narrowly escaping with his life.

Who knows about tomorrow

00:59:20,737 --> 00:59:22,602
Your wounds shall hum

565
00:59:22,739 --> 00:59:27,073
And your pain shall
become a melody

683
01:09:45,027 --> 01:09:49,964

Do you remember me.

709
01:12:09,305 --> 01:12:10,704
Who is this idiot?

710
01:12:14,443 --> 01:12:17,810
Don't throw it so hard.
Father's ears turned red.

711
01:12:19,448 --> 01:12:21,575
Didn't he go to work?

712
01:12:22,752 --> 01:12:23,741
Holiday.

713
01:12:23,853 --> 01:12:25,548
Gandhiji's birth anniversary.

714
01:12:27,123 --> 01:12:28,556
What is Gandhiji's holiday?

715
01:12:29,392 --> 01:12:31,724
Gandhiji got us freedom
from the British.

716
01:12:31,894 --> 01:12:34,727
So it's a national
holiday on his birthday.

717

We have national
holidays for important people.

719
01:12:46,208 --> 01:12:51,771
One day there'll be a
holiday in Milkha's name.

Stand straight!

725
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:25,672
Whose is it?

726
01:13:26,582 --> 01:13:27,571
lt's mine.

727
01:13:28,117 --> 01:13:29,414
Not the cycle.

728
01:13:29,885 --> 01:13:31,409
l'm talking about the butter tins.

729
01:13:32,288 --> 01:13:33,482
Did you steal them?

730
01:13:33,989 --> 01:13:35,422
What are you saying? No!

A bill for what? They're mine.

734
01:13:42,298 --> 01:13:44,095
This is the Shahdara
police station.

735
01:13:44,834 --> 01:13:47,166
Without a receipt you
can't take them past here.

736
01:13:47,703 --> 01:13:50,797
Collect them when
you have the bill.

737
01:13:52,208 --> 01:13:55,541
They go with me.

738
01:13:56,512 --> 01:13:59,481
Do l have 'dumb ass'
printed on my forehead?

739
01:14:01,917 --> 01:14:03,782
Sorry sir, l can't read.

740
01:14:13,028 --> 01:14:14,325

Ok. Leave one and take one.

742
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,827
No, l will take them both.

743
01:14:20,102 --> 01:14:21,091
You sure?

744
01:14:21,437 --> 01:14:22,529
Oh yes...very sure.

745
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:29,734
What do you think you are doing?

746
01:14:37,319 --> 01:14:41,380
What are you doing?
You will fall sick.

747
01:14:41,657 --> 01:14:42,646
Move back.

748
01:14:44,894 --> 01:14:48,227
Have you lost it?
- Move back.

749
01:14:48,397 --> 01:14:49,796
Move back.

750
01:14:56,071 --> 01:14:57,060
Move.

751
01:15:06,315 --> 01:15:07,304
Move back.

752

755
01:15:33,008 --> 01:15:36,466
..27, 28, 29, 30..

756
01:15:36,579 --> 01:15:39,980
..31, 32, 33, 34..

757
01:15:40,049 --> 01:15:45,180
Shut up..
- ..35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40..

758
01:15:45,287 --> 01:15:49,314

759
01:15:49,425 --> 01:15:52,519
..47, 48, 49, 50.

760
01:15:56,899 --> 01:15:57,888
Shut up!

761
01:16:00,803 --> 01:16:04,136
What are you doing, Milkha?

762
01:16:14,984 --> 01:16:20,581
51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56..

763
01:16:20,789 --> 01:16:21,983
..57..

764
01:16:22,558 --> 01:16:27,791
..91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96..

765
01:16:27,863 --> 01:16:33,460
Have you lost it?
- ..97, 98, 99, 100!

766
01:16:48,817 --> 01:16:51,445
Why one?
You can have them both now!

767
01:17:17,613 --> 01:17:19,103
There is something about that boy.

768
01:17:27,690 --> 01:17:30,056
These are the heroes of today...

769
01:17:30,392 --> 01:17:32,587
... those who rob and steal...

770
01:17:32,828 --> 01:17:34,523
... thieves and goons.

771
01:17:45,007 --> 01:17:45,996
Biro!

772
01:17:53,115 --> 01:17:54,104
Biro!

773
01:17:56,485 --> 01:17:58,385
l want to marry you.

774
01:18:00,356 --> 01:18:01,584
Don't be shy.

775
01:18:02,224 --> 01:18:07,662
We'll have dozens of Kids.
Mahinder, Parminder, Jaswinder

776
01:18:08,063 --> 01:18:11,396
Dharmender, Rajinder.
- To be thieves like you?

777
01:18:20,576 --> 01:18:22,100
l'll give up all that.

778
01:18:28,951 --> 01:18:30,543
You trust me, don't you?

779
01:18:39,661 --> 01:18:41,891
l'll make something of my
life and come back for you.

780
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:45,728
Will you wait for me?

781
01:18:49,505 --> 01:18:50,597
Yes.

782
01:18:57,780 --> 01:18:59,407
Love can conquer anything.

783
01:19:01,517 --> 01:19:06,511
He didn't ask for much.

784
01:19:07,122 --> 01:19:12,355
Just a small business...
to help live an honest life.

785
01:19:13,028 --> 01:19:18,933
But to earn money,
you need money don't you?

786
01:19:20,636 --> 01:19:23,230
A thousand? Too much...

787
01:19:24,073 --> 01:19:25,233
Do something!

788
01:19:26,341 --> 01:19:28,138
We will need a year.

789
01:19:29,611 --> 01:19:31,306
l don't have a year!

790
01:19:32,481 --> 01:19:34,506
One big last job then.

791
01:19:39,121 --> 01:19:42,955
No, no more stealing...

792
01:19:44,426 --> 01:19:45,893
l don't want to be a thief.

793
01:19:48,497 --> 01:19:49,794
Ticket please...

794
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:53,791
Ticket.

795
01:19:54,837 --> 01:19:56,429
Milkha, you've got them?

796
01:19:57,773 --> 01:19:58,865
No.

797
01:19:59,374 --> 01:20:00,636
Look again.

798
01:20:04,179 --> 01:20:05,168
Hurry up!

799
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:06,645
There are other passengers too.

800
01:20:08,217 --> 01:20:10,117
Stop.

801
01:20:10,686 --> 01:20:11,914
Milkha, run!

802
01:20:12,921 --> 01:20:14,445
Run!

803
01:20:14,857 --> 01:20:19,021
Run! Milkha Run!

804
01:22:28,790 --> 01:22:32,191
Why did you come here?
- Let's go.

805
01:22:41,003 --> 01:22:42,800
Where are your gold earrings?

806
01:22:54,650 --> 01:22:57,346
You sold them to post my bail,
didn't you?

807
01:23:03,692 --> 01:23:05,922
l've always taken from you.

808
01:23:07,262 --> 01:23:08,559
Don't talk nonsense!

809
01:23:10,799 --> 01:23:11,993
Let's go home.

810
01:23:13,769 --> 01:23:15,600
He struggled hard...

811
01:23:16,638 --> 01:23:18,299
... knocked at many a doors.

812
01:23:19,408 --> 01:23:23,071
Ultimately,
the Army gave him respectability.

813
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:27,479
Maybe fate was now on his side.

814
01:23:29,718 --> 01:23:33,119
You moron! Loosen up. Grip hard!

815
01:23:33,288 --> 01:23:35,916
Fool! Lift your legs.

816
01:23:37,326 --> 01:23:39,590
These shoes are full of nails.

817
01:23:40,295 --> 01:23:41,319
l can't run in them.

818
01:23:41,463 --> 01:23:43,522
Give it a try.

819
01:23:45,767 --> 01:23:47,758
No sir... l can't...

820
01:23:49,204 --> 01:23:50,364
Gurudev Singh..

821
01:23:51,139 --> 01:23:52,333
Ranvir Singh.

822
01:23:52,441 --> 01:23:53,908
How are you?

823
01:23:54,042 --> 01:23:55,066
How are you?

824
01:23:55,143 --> 01:23:57,509
ls this the stone boy?
- Yes.

825
01:23:58,347 --> 01:24:02,283
Milkha, Ranvir Singh,
the lndian team coach.

826
01:24:04,753 --> 01:24:05,947
Your blessings, sir.

827
01:24:06,688 --> 01:24:07,677
God bless you.

828
01:24:08,290 --> 01:24:09,382
How are you?

829
01:24:11,126 --> 01:24:12,684
Fighting with these nails sir.

830
01:24:14,429 --> 01:24:18,160
Now you are, but soon these spikes
will be your best friends.

831
01:24:20,502 --> 01:24:24,199
Sir, can't we run
barefoot in the Olympics?

832
01:24:24,272 --> 01:24:25,603
Don't be..

833
01:24:25,674 --> 01:24:26,732
Come with me.

834
01:24:37,052 --> 01:24:38,485
Run and show me.

835
01:24:43,592 --> 01:24:45,583
Come back.

836
01:26:33,702 --> 01:26:35,397
Easy... easy...

837
01:26:37,439 --> 01:26:39,304
Why are you hiding their names?

838
01:26:40,208 --> 01:26:42,039
Who were they?

839
01:26:42,477 --> 01:26:46,072
Tell me their names
once and l will...

840
01:26:47,315 --> 01:26:49,613
Looks like we'll need to admit him
in the hospital tomorrow.

841
01:26:51,052 --> 01:26:52,986
All his efforts gone to waste.

842
01:26:59,094 --> 01:27:00,994
Male no.1 Makhan Singh.

843
01:27:02,264 --> 01:27:04,255

844
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:07,693

Male no.5 Milkha Singh.

847
01:27:16,578 --> 01:27:18,136
Male no.5 Milkha Singh.

848
01:27:18,647 --> 01:27:19,875
Yes, sir.
- Oh, God.

849
01:27:27,188 --> 01:27:30,680
Have you gone mad?

850
01:27:31,459 --> 01:27:32,483
Let it be.

851
01:27:33,795 --> 01:27:35,126
Milkha.

852
01:27:37,165 --> 01:27:38,154
Sit down.

853
01:27:41,202 --> 01:27:42,191
Sit down.

854
01:27:47,676 --> 01:27:48,734
Listen carefully...

855
01:27:49,477 --> 01:27:50,842
... you'll get more chances.

856
01:27:51,112 --> 01:27:54,775
lf you run now,
you could damage your legs forever.

857
01:27:55,483 --> 01:27:56,609
Understood.

858
01:28:04,025 --> 01:28:05,686
Gurudev, make him see sense.

859
01:28:06,861 --> 01:28:10,297
Don't be stubborn...

860
01:28:10,432 --> 01:28:11,592
... forget it.

861
01:28:14,169 --> 01:28:15,261
What are you doing?

862
01:28:16,271 --> 01:28:17,863
Your feet are swollen!

863
01:28:20,709 --> 01:28:23,269
Give it a rest now.

864
01:28:23,445 --> 01:28:24,776
Let me run.

865
01:28:29,284 --> 01:28:31,081
You know what this means to me...

866
01:29:16,931 --> 01:29:19,923
O Lord, keep my honour.

867
01:29:21,469 --> 01:29:22,868
On your marks.

868
01:29:24,839 --> 01:29:25,828
Set.

869
01:30:44,753 --> 01:30:50,589
The name of Nanak
is like a ship...

870
01:30:54,395 --> 01:30:58,855
...which will save you
in troubled waters

871
01:31:03,371 --> 01:31:09,003
The ones who have
Nanak's name in their hearts,

872
01:31:13,882 --> 01:31:20,845
Nanak makes them
cross the ocean of life

873
01:31:24,826 --> 01:31:32,995
Nanak makes them
cross the ocean of life

874
01:31:55,089 --> 01:31:57,114
Well done!

875
01:31:58,026 --> 01:32:00,187
Are you all right?

876
01:32:01,196 --> 01:32:02,561
Are you all right?

877
01:32:05,633 --> 01:32:06,725
Well done.

878
01:32:07,669 --> 01:32:09,796
Are you all right?

879
01:32:12,473 --> 01:32:16,102
Milkha, you broke
the national record.

880
01:32:22,217 --> 01:32:26,916
You crazy fellow...

881
01:32:27,522 --> 01:32:33,222
... you've broken
the national record.

882
01:32:38,099 --> 01:32:39,293
Guruji.

883
01:32:44,539 --> 01:32:47,770
Milkha has become lndia!

884
01:32:53,681 --> 01:32:57,515
Milk and turmeric
powder heals wounds fast.

885
01:32:57,952 --> 01:33:00,079
Who is Milkha Singh?

886
01:33:00,688 --> 01:33:01,677
l am.

887
01:33:03,057 --> 01:33:04,922
l need your measurements
for the blazer.

888
01:33:11,266 --> 01:33:12,893
Come in.

889
01:33:21,342 --> 01:33:23,276
Length, 28 inches.

890
01:33:30,985 --> 01:33:33,385
Chest, 38 inches.

891
01:33:36,858 --> 01:33:39,725
During the measurement
Milkha looked as shy...

892
01:33:41,596 --> 01:33:43,757
... as a new bride getting
her wedding gown stitched.

893
01:33:44,198 --> 01:33:45,688
Shoulder, 18 inches.

894
01:33:48,569 --> 01:33:50,298

01:33:57,178 --> 01:34:00,306
Wrist, 10 inches.

897
01:34:07,655 --> 01:34:08,883
Jassi.

898
01:34:27,675 --> 01:34:28,664
Yes?

899
01:34:39,921 --> 01:34:40,910
Milkha.

900
01:34:59,874 --> 01:35:01,842
Milkha!

901
01:35:10,718 --> 01:35:12,549
l am your Milkhu.

902
01:35:13,354 --> 01:35:14,685
l am not a ghost.

903
01:35:14,756 --> 01:35:15,745
No!

904
01:35:26,634 --> 01:35:28,101
Why wear a coat in this heat?

905
01:35:28,870 --> 01:35:31,304
This isn't any coat, it's a blazer.

906
01:35:31,839 --> 01:35:33,602
The lndian team blazer. Look!

907
01:35:35,710 --> 01:35:37,803
Your brother has
worked very hard for it.

908
01:35:38,379 --> 01:35:41,212
Here, you wear it.

909
01:35:42,083 --> 01:35:43,448
l'll look silly in a coat.

910
01:35:44,152 --> 01:35:45,050
Not me.

911
01:35:45,153 --> 01:35:46,211
Try it!

912
01:35:46,521 --> 01:35:49,217
Put it on.

913
01:35:54,095 --> 01:35:55,357
All this fuss for a coat.

914
01:35:56,931 --> 01:35:58,296
lt looks so good on you.

915
01:35:59,834 --> 01:36:02,132
Now put your hands in the pockets.

916
01:36:03,638 --> 01:36:04,627
Like this.

917
01:36:32,166 --> 01:36:33,292
Sister, stop crying.

918
01:36:36,571 --> 01:36:38,562
Do you want to flood
the Chenab river?

919
01:37:07,902 --> 01:37:14,569
O dyer of my soul

920
01:37:15,476 --> 01:37:23,349
O dyer of my soul in
the river of your colour

921
01:37:23,451 --> 01:37:30,857
O dyer of my soul in the
river of your colour

922
01:37:31,292 --> 01:37:35,888
l want to be immersed

923
01:37:38,699 --> 01:37:44,296
l don't want a
separate identity from yours

924
01:37:46,040 --> 01:37:53,572
A single breath l will
not take separate from you

925
01:37:53,781 --> 01:38:01,313
A single breath l will not
take separate from you

926
01:38:01,656 --> 01:38:06,593
Let my soul be torn from my body

927
01:38:08,863 --> 01:38:15,098
l don't want a
separate identity from yours

928
01:38:15,770 --> 01:38:19,467
Dye me in your colour

929
01:38:19,540 --> 01:38:23,306
Gently let the colour seep in

930
01:38:23,377 --> 01:38:27,143
Let rain soaked colour drench me

931
01:38:27,415 --> 01:38:33,354
Make me your own,
make me your own

932
01:39:05,219 --> 01:39:08,518
Crafted like an ornament

933
01:39:08,623 --> 01:39:10,853
l want to wear you my love

934
01:39:12,860 --> 01:39:16,227
Come to my lips let me sing you

935
01:39:16,297 --> 01:39:18,231
Be my only song

936
01:39:18,266 --> 01:39:23,067
Grind away my anguish

937
01:39:23,237 --> 01:39:28,106
Dissolve into me

938
01:39:28,175 --> 01:39:31,941
Melt into me

939
01:39:32,013 --> 01:39:34,277
Make me your own

940
01:39:35,783 --> 01:39:39,446
Dye me in your colour

941
01:39:39,587 --> 01:39:43,318
Gently let the colour seep in

942
01:39:43,424 --> 01:39:47,190
Let rain soaked colour drench me

943
01:39:47,461 --> 01:39:52,694
Make me your own,
make me your own

944
01:39:54,869 --> 01:39:58,600
Dye me in your colour

945
01:39:58,673 --> 01:40:02,302
Gently let the colour seep in

946
01:40:02,410 --> 01:40:06,210
Let rain soaked colour drench me

947
01:40:06,547 --> 01:40:11,575
Make me your own,
make me your own

948
01:40:37,211 --> 01:40:39,236
Who has come to take me away?

949
01:40:40,414 --> 01:40:41,745
Who is my Romeo?

950
01:40:46,087 --> 01:40:47,179
Who are you?

951
01:40:47,788 --> 01:40:48,880
Who are you?

952
01:41:04,872 --> 01:41:06,396
l knew l'd find you here.

953
01:41:06,574 --> 01:41:07,734
Give me a hug!

954
01:41:09,143 --> 01:41:10,269
How are you?

955
01:41:10,544 --> 01:41:11,875
See for yourself.

956
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:16,613
Meeru, someone else live here now.

957
01:41:17,585 --> 01:41:18,882
Where is she?

958
01:41:19,954 --> 01:41:22,047
You look Smart.

959
01:41:22,289 --> 01:41:23,620
The others will be thrilled.

960
01:41:24,191 --> 01:41:26,284
l am asking about Biro
and you are rambling on.

961
01:41:27,561 --> 01:41:29,825
Come let's meet the gang.

962
01:41:31,665 --> 01:41:32,654
Hey, stop it.

963
01:41:33,434 --> 01:41:34,731
What has happened to her?

964
01:41:35,035 --> 01:41:37,526
They don't live here anymore.

965
01:41:37,838 --> 01:41:38,930
Where do they?

966
01:41:39,740 --> 01:41:40,798
Don't know.

967
01:41:43,544 --> 01:41:44,977
Come out with it now.

968
01:41:45,746 --> 01:41:46,838
What happened?

969
01:41:48,716 --> 01:41:50,115
She was married off.

970
01:42:05,132 --> 01:42:06,690
All this was happening
and you didn't tell me?

971
01:42:06,801 --> 01:42:07,893
What could l tell you?

972
01:42:08,135 --> 01:42:09,466
And what if l had told you?

973
01:42:09,670 --> 01:42:14,630
Would you have dropped everything
and come? lt was too late.

974
01:42:15,342 --> 01:42:17,071
She said she'd wait for me.

975
01:42:18,446 --> 01:42:19,936
Didn't Biro protest?

976
01:42:20,714 --> 01:42:23,683
She did and was thrashed for it.

977
01:42:25,085 --> 01:42:26,916
Who cares what women want?

978
01:42:27,922 --> 01:42:30,982
l have to meet her.
Who did she marry?

979
01:42:31,592 --> 01:42:33,184
What difference does it make?

980
01:42:34,295 --> 01:42:35,523
lt does damn it!

981
01:43:33,020 --> 01:43:44,522
A single breath l will not
take separate from you

982
01:43:45,366 --> 01:43:51,930
Let my soul be torn from my body

983
01:43:55,543 --> 01:44:03,006
l don't want a
separate identity from yours

984
01:44:07,388 --> 01:44:09,253
l can't do it without you.

985
01:44:09,657 --> 01:44:12,717
Crazy fellow! Of course you can!

986
01:44:13,694 --> 01:44:15,321
Everything will be fine.

987
01:44:16,297 --> 01:44:18,959
Ranvir Singh is a great coach.

988
01:44:27,875 --> 01:44:29,604
l'm losing everyone.

989
01:44:32,146 --> 01:44:33,272
Foolish boy!

990
01:44:34,415 --> 01:44:38,146
Birds that fly high up
don't get attached to small trees.

991
01:44:40,087 --> 01:44:42,487
The sky is the limit.

992
01:44:45,326 --> 01:44:50,161
You're off to Australia,
a foreign country.

993
01:44:50,931 --> 01:44:52,956
Come on! Give me a hug.

994
01:45:08,983 --> 01:45:10,007
Hey Milkha.

995
01:45:12,319 --> 01:45:14,514
Our seats are together.

996
01:45:15,522 --> 01:45:18,320
Mahinder,
how does one tie this belt?

997
01:45:19,526 --> 01:45:23,826
Tie it the way you tie pajamas.

998
01:45:24,732 --> 01:45:26,131
Like this. - Hello.

999
01:45:28,135 --> 01:45:29,124
Hello.

1000
01:45:29,637 --> 01:45:31,366
Let me help you.

1001
01:45:40,514 --> 01:45:41,708
There you are.

1002
01:45:42,483 --> 01:45:43,950
When do we undo it?

1003
01:45:44,151 --> 01:45:46,016
When the plane is in the air.

1004
01:45:55,863 --> 01:45:56,921
Who is she?

1005
01:45:58,198 --> 01:46:01,292
What sort of a champion are you?
You don't know Perizad?

1006
01:46:02,269 --> 01:46:04,669
She's a swimming champion.
A mermaid.

1007
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:07,834
lsn't she sweet?

1008
01:46:09,176 --> 01:46:11,371
l've heard she's tough with guys.
Doesn't stand fools.

1009
01:46:11,912 --> 01:46:13,174
We aren't fools...

1010
01:46:13,447 --> 01:46:14,471
... dumb either.

1011
01:46:14,848 --> 01:46:16,110
Then become so.

1012
01:46:20,587 --> 01:46:23,078
Hey, it's going to take off!

1013
01:46:24,291 --> 01:46:27,021
The way you speed up
before a long jump, same thing.

1014
01:46:27,828 --> 01:46:29,557
We're about to fly! Look!

1015
01:46:30,631 --> 01:46:31,757
Shut up!

1016
01:46:33,901 --> 01:46:36,301
O Lord, have mercy.

1017
01:46:40,908 --> 01:46:42,170
Something is wrong...

1018
01:46:43,777 --> 01:46:45,176
... l can't see anything.

1019
01:46:46,146 --> 01:46:47,704
This isn't right...

1020
01:46:48,348 --> 01:46:49,679
... he's come too high up.

1021
01:46:49,950 --> 01:46:51,884
Milkha, what's wrong?

1022
01:46:52,753 --> 01:46:55,278
Look clouds below us...

1023
01:46:56,457 --> 01:46:58,357
... we're above the clouds.
- Yes.

1024
01:46:58,759 --> 01:47:00,158
l can't see a thing!

1025
01:47:01,662 --> 01:47:07,259
We'll crash!
Let's get out, come on!

1026
01:47:07,468 --> 01:47:08,366
Sit down.

1027
01:47:08,435 --> 01:47:09,424
Milkha, sit down.

1028
01:47:09,603 --> 01:47:10,570
Milkha, sit down.

1029
01:47:10,671 --> 01:47:11,899
Sir, he's too high!

1030
01:47:12,372 --> 01:47:13,361
We'll crash, sir!

1031
01:47:13,874 --> 01:47:15,102
Sir, l can't see anything.

1032
01:47:15,642 --> 01:47:17,041
Excuse me. All fine?

1033
01:47:17,144 --> 01:47:19,169
What happened?
Please take the seat.

1034
01:47:19,313 --> 01:47:20,280
What happened?

1035
01:47:20,314 --> 01:47:23,977
Look. We're too high up!
He'll crash the plane.

1036
01:47:24,818 --> 01:47:28,845
Don't worry. The plane flies
over the clouds. Please calm down.

1037
01:47:28,956 --> 01:47:30,150
Please take care of the boys.

1038
01:47:30,390 --> 01:47:31,448
Who are you?

1039
01:47:31,859 --> 01:47:35,955
The captain. l fly the plane.

1040
01:47:36,964 --> 01:47:38,295
And you left the controls?

1041
01:47:38,365 --> 01:47:41,266
Don't worry, two of us fly a plane.

1042
01:47:41,401 --> 01:47:43,301
Please take care of them.
- Yes.

1043
01:47:43,504 --> 01:47:44,596
Everything okay?

1044
01:47:48,642 --> 01:47:51,509
Remember, Mahinder

1045
01:47:52,379 --> 01:47:55,280
Nothing can harm
those whom God protects.

1046
01:48:58,812 --> 01:49:00,211
Look at those guys.

1047
01:49:06,587 --> 01:49:07,645
They're walking to us.

1048
01:49:07,754 --> 01:49:08,743
Talk to them.

1049
01:49:08,889 --> 01:49:09,878
Hi.

1050

Boys, come here. - Yes, sir.

1055
01:49:30,277 --> 01:49:32,302
Mr. Peter Hamilton.

1056
01:49:32,846 --> 01:49:34,871
Our technical advisor.

1057
01:49:35,249 --> 01:49:39,117
A champion in his day.

1058
01:49:39,686 --> 01:49:40,675
All yours.

1059
01:49:42,990 --> 01:49:44,480
Ranvir, what's this about?

1060
01:49:44,958 --> 01:49:47,984
That's the lndian way
of respecting coaches.

1061
01:49:48,562 --> 01:49:50,757
Why don't you get them
rounded up to my place.

1062
01:49:52,966 --> 01:49:55,457
Don't take that trouble, Mr.
Hamilton.

1063
01:49:55,602 --> 01:49:57,001
lt's no problem at all.

1064
01:49:57,437 --> 01:50:00,304
lt'll give the boys a chance to loosen
up a bit. Get to know each other.

1065
01:50:02,776 --> 01:50:03,765
Okay then.

Walk straight into my arms,
why dither so?

1106
01:53:36,356 --> 01:53:40,053
You, my whiskey, my hooch

1107
01:53:40,327 --> 01:53:44,127
You've intoxicated me so

1108
01:53:44,297 --> 01:53:48,825
Don't stop me, restrain me
not, let me drink like a king

1109
01:53:48,935 --> 01:53:52,029
Blend-in boy, blend-in

1110
01:53:52,873 --> 01:53:55,933
Blend-in boy, blend-in

1111
01:54:28,875 --> 01:54:32,436
ln the darkness of the
night the hands go astray

1112
01:54:32,913 --> 01:54:39,182
The lips start to lie
and morals start to loosen

1113
01:54:40,921 --> 01:54:46,223
When you descend into the ocean,
the water beams crimson

1114
01:54:48,628 --> 01:54:52,428
When you descend into the
ocean, the water beams crimson

1115
01:54:52,899 --> 01:54:56,357
The waves become tipsy,
and the fish too are drunk

1116
01:54:56,436 --> 01:55:00,099
You, my whiskey, my hooch

1117
01:55:00,307 --> 01:55:04,107
You've intoxicated me so

1118
01:55:04,277 --> 01:55:08,805
Don't stop me, restrain me not,
let me drink like a king

1119
01:55:08,915 --> 01:55:12,146
Blend-in boy, blend-in

1120
01:55:12,852 --> 01:55:15,878
Blend-in boy, blend-in

1121
01:55:16,890 --> 01:55:19,950
Blend-in boy, blend-in

1122
01:55:20,860 --> 01:55:23,886
Blend-in boy, blend-in

1123
01:55:24,898 --> 01:55:27,890
Blend-in boy, blend-in

1124
01:55:28,902 --> 01:55:31,996
Blend-in boy, blend-in

1125
01:55:52,892 --> 01:55:57,022
Blend-in boy, blend-in

1126
01:56:15,382 --> 01:56:16,474
Who's there?

1127
01:56:27,560 --> 01:56:29,790
Oh! The wrong key.

1128
01:58:29,916 --> 01:58:31,474
Wakey-wakey!

1129
01:58:36,523 --> 01:58:37,512
No beer.

1130
01:59:18,264 --> 01:59:19,253
Sorry, sir.

1131
01:59:29,042 --> 01:59:32,409
You're never late. What's going on?

1132
01:59:35,315 --> 01:59:36,304
Answer me.

1133
01:59:36,950 --> 01:59:38,611
l had some beer last night, sir.

1134
01:59:40,119 --> 01:59:42,246
You came here to drink beer?
- No, sir.

1135
01:59:42,655 --> 01:59:43,917
Why did you come here?

1136
01:59:45,758 --> 01:59:46,850
To run, sir.

1137
01:59:47,527 --> 01:59:50,018
You have a qualifying
race in 4 days.

1138
01:59:51,364 --> 01:59:53,025
lf you don't qualify...

1139
01:59:53,933 --> 01:59:55,161
... you're out.

1140
01:59:56,302 --> 01:59:57,326
Look at me!

1141
01:59:59,506 --> 02:00:00,495
Milkha Singh.

1142
02:00:01,374 --> 02:00:03,774
To be a sportsman,
you have to be determined...

1143
02:00:05,612 --> 02:00:08,410
... disciplined and dedicated.

1144
02:00:09,549 --> 02:00:10,573
Sorry, sir.

1145
02:00:11,584 --> 02:00:12,642
Go warm up.

1146
02:00:14,120 --> 02:00:15,109
Yes, sir.

1147
02:00:18,625 --> 02:00:20,991
Did you score?

1148
02:00:22,095 --> 02:00:23,084
No.

1149
02:00:23,196 --> 02:00:24,527
Tell me.
- Hey, Singh!

1150
02:00:30,069 --> 02:00:31,229
l'll see you later.

1151
02:01:03,136 --> 02:01:06,299
You're as delicate as glass

1152
02:01:13,346 --> 02:01:14,904
Breathe lightly

1153
02:01:15,381 --> 02:01:19,317
God forbid you shatter
when you strain to turn

1154
02:01:23,356 --> 02:01:26,792
You need me so let
me carry you away

1155
02:01:27,360 --> 02:01:30,796
Walking gently,
l'll turn into a habit

1156
02:01:30,897 --> 02:01:34,628
You, my whiskey, my hooch

1157
02:01:34,867 --> 02:01:38,633
You've intoxicated me so

1158
02:01:38,771 --> 02:01:43,367
Don't stop me, restrain me
not, let me drink like a king

1159
02:04:14,594 --> 02:04:16,960
Hey, Singh.

1160
02:04:17,730 --> 02:04:18,890
l am so sorry.

1161
02:04:19,632 --> 02:04:22,157
You need to go easy on
yourself, it's so tough out there.

1162
02:04:24,270 --> 02:04:25,259
Hey.

1163
02:04:27,774 --> 02:04:29,366
You're not blaming me,
are you?

1164
02:04:31,511 --> 02:04:32,535
Are you?

1165
02:06:04,937 --> 02:06:06,097
Sorry, Stella.

1166
02:06:09,442 --> 02:06:12,138
You're not the problem.

1167
02:06:14,347 --> 02:06:15,336
l'm the problem.

1168
02:06:39,772 --> 02:06:41,763
l'm really going to miss you.

1169
02:06:43,976 --> 02:06:44,965
Sorry.

1170
02:07:12,571 --> 02:07:13,560
Sir.

1171
02:07:20,913 --> 02:07:23,108
What is the 400m world record, sir?

1172
02:08:42,261 --> 02:08:44,195
The world is lashing out at you

1173
02:08:44,296 --> 02:08:46,093
Welcome the battle cry

1174
02:08:46,198 --> 02:08:47,927
Your arms are like oars

1175
02:08:48,034 --> 02:08:50,696
Feet that raise an uproar

1176
02:08:51,504 --> 02:08:53,096
Your every vein is iron ore

1177
02:08:53,205 --> 02:08:55,765
You are fire Milkha

1178
02:08:56,609 --> 02:08:58,804
Now you run Milkha

1179
02:09:00,446 --> 02:09:07,113
Now you run Milkha, run Milkha,
run run run run run Milkha

1180
02:09:08,087 --> 02:09:10,112
Let go the baggage of yesterday

1181
02:09:10,222 --> 02:09:11,951
Cut the ropes and
leashes that bind you

1182
02:09:12,024 --> 02:09:13,992
This earth shall question you

1183
02:09:15,227 --> 02:09:16,990
Each breath like
fire from the kiln

1184
02:09:17,063 --> 02:09:19,588
Now awaken Milkha

1185
02:09:19,799 --> 02:09:22,700
Now you run Milkha

1186
02:09:25,905 --> 02:09:29,739
O rod of steel

1187
02:09:31,444 --> 02:09:35,778
O boat

1188
02:09:36,749 --> 02:09:38,512
O rod of steel

1189
02:09:38,617 --> 02:09:40,551
Turn around the tides of fire

1190
02:09:40,619 --> 02:09:42,246
O boat

1191
02:09:42,321 --> 02:09:45,119
Your glory lies in sinking

1192
02:09:45,991 --> 02:09:47,925
O jungle, O jungle

1193
02:09:48,294 --> 02:09:51,286
Today you will take on the cities

1194
02:09:51,363 --> 02:09:54,059
Now you run Milkha

1195
02:10:30,369 --> 02:10:31,597
Milkha, get up!

1196
02:10:33,772 --> 02:10:35,205
Did you hear what l said?

1197
02:10:36,575 --> 02:10:37,564
Get up.

1198
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:48,885
The world record is broken.

1199
02:10:50,156 --> 02:10:52,215
Milkha Singh has
broken the world record!

1200
02:10:52,925 --> 02:10:55,257
Everyone is cheering... hear them?

1201
02:10:59,798 --> 02:11:01,288
l want that paper back!

1202
02:11:01,834 --> 02:11:03,495
l want that paper back!

1203
02:11:13,679 --> 02:11:17,979
Throw off all your
cares and troubles

1204
02:11:19,118 --> 02:11:23,145
The skeletons of the past

1205
02:11:24,723 --> 02:11:28,921
The soles of your feet
are like horse shoes

1206
02:11:30,296 --> 02:11:34,460
You've got to do it come what may

1207
02:11:34,900 --> 02:11:38,666
Yes. Come on, move.

1208
02:11:41,407 --> 02:11:43,102
Move, Milkha.

1209
02:11:47,479 --> 02:11:51,142
Tear open the wheels of that chariot
Turn it into the divine disc

1210
02:11:51,250 --> 02:11:52,979
Bind well the laces of war

1211
02:11:53,152 --> 02:11:57,589
The lion has emerged
from his lair

1212
02:11:58,057 --> 02:12:01,515
Fire the bullet Milkha

1213
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:04,058
Now you must run Milkha

1214
02:13:01,687 --> 02:13:02,676
lt killed me.

1215
02:13:03,822 --> 02:13:05,119
But l enjoyed it!

1216
02:13:21,740 --> 02:13:23,002
Sir, what is this?

1217
02:13:24,843 --> 02:13:25,935
Put them on.

1218
02:13:32,651 --> 02:13:34,619
They're heavy.
- Tie them up.

1219
02:13:54,206 --> 02:13:55,332
l can't lift my feet, sir.

1220
02:13:55,541 --> 02:13:58,601
Never mind...
you'll enjoy this even more.

1221
02:14:31,276 --> 02:14:37,840
Now you must rise Milkha

1222
02:14:38,584 --> 02:14:45,080
You are fire Milkha

1223
02:14:46,191 --> 02:14:52,687
Now you must rise Milkha

1224
02:14:53,365 --> 02:14:59,998
You are fire Milkha

1225
02:15:04,843 --> 02:15:08,040
O rod of steel

1226
02:15:10,582 --> 02:15:16,680
O boat

1227
02:15:20,859 --> 02:15:22,724
The field is your cradle

1228
02:15:22,795 --> 02:15:24,456
Cover it with your splendour

1229
02:15:24,630 --> 02:15:26,359
The mountains are at your head

1230
02:15:26,465 --> 02:15:30,094
Drape the entire sky

1231
02:15:30,169 --> 02:15:34,503
Tie the turban of resolve Milkha

1232
02:15:36,008 --> 02:15:40,274
Now you must run Milkha

1233
02:15:41,613 --> 02:15:47,984
Now you must rise Milkha

1234
02:15:48,720 --> 02:15:53,953
You are fire Milkha

1235
02:17:41,333 --> 02:17:45,326
Sorry, please forgive me.

1236
02:17:46,705 --> 02:17:47,967
l am not insulting you...

1237
02:17:49,641 --> 02:17:51,131
... this is a fight with myself.

1238
02:18:28,246 --> 02:18:33,445
O Lord! May l die on my feet,
not on my knees.

1239
02:19:25,771 --> 02:19:30,572
Abdul Khaliq was Pakistan's pride.

1240
02:19:31,443 --> 02:19:33,104
The fastest runner in Asia.

1241
02:19:35,647 --> 02:19:38,411
Milkha couldn't
wait to see him run.

1242
02:19:38,850 --> 02:19:42,616
The next day he was
to run against him.

1243
02:20:27,933 --> 02:20:32,700
l'm grateful to
my countrymen and to Coach Javed.

1244
02:20:33,605 --> 02:20:35,402
Salaam!
- Thanks.

1245
02:20:37,342 --> 02:20:38,331
Javed sir.

1246
02:20:39,578 --> 02:20:41,136
Your boy ran well.

1247
02:20:41,747 --> 02:20:43,476
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1248
02:20:43,982 --> 02:20:45,540
Bravo! You ruled the field.

1249
02:20:46,017 --> 02:20:47,041
Thank you, sir.

1250
02:20:47,385 --> 02:20:48,511
This is Milkha Singh.

1251
02:20:48,887 --> 02:20:51,355
lndia's 400m champion athlete.

1252
02:20:52,424 --> 02:20:53,482
Hello, sir.

1253
02:20:53,959 --> 02:20:57,087
You're competing in the 200m race.

1254
02:20:58,930 --> 02:20:59,988
All the best.

1255
02:21:00,332 --> 02:21:01,299
To you too.

1256
02:21:01,833 --> 02:21:03,164
Watch out.

1257
02:21:04,002 --> 02:21:05,799
Watch out, Khaliq.

1258
02:21:07,172 --> 02:21:09,470
l hear you ran
away from Pakistan...

1259
02:21:12,444 --> 02:21:14,378
... have been running
ever since, huh?

1260
02:21:16,782 --> 02:21:19,512
Now you need to show
your magic in 200m as well.

1261
02:21:20,919 --> 02:21:21,908
Come.

1262
02:21:22,154 --> 02:21:24,145
We've seen dozens like Milkha.

1263
02:21:26,091 --> 02:21:28,457
We have two choices...

1264
02:21:29,327 --> 02:21:32,763
... leave our village
and go to the new lndia.

1265
02:21:34,299 --> 02:21:37,598
Or change our religion as they ask.

1266
02:21:37,669 --> 02:21:39,068
We shall not eat cow's meat!

1267
02:21:39,371 --> 02:21:42,829
They can behead us, but we
will never change our religion!

1268
02:21:45,143 --> 02:21:48,544
Prepare to fight then.

1269
02:21:49,781 --> 02:21:54,741
When Guru Govind Singh
left Anantpur Sahib...

1270
02:21:55,453 --> 02:21:57,478
... and reached Garhwal fort...

1271
02:21:57,956 --> 02:22:00,322
... he had only 40 Sikhs with him.

1272
02:22:00,759 --> 02:22:03,728
While the enemy were a million!

1273
02:22:05,297 --> 02:22:09,028
Guruji dressed
his sons in armour...

1274
02:22:09,134 --> 02:22:10,897
...and sent them to battle.

1275
02:22:11,870 --> 02:22:13,929
His forty men fought hard.

1276
02:22:15,507 --> 02:22:18,442
They fought a mighty army.

1277
02:22:18,877 --> 02:22:21,311
How will we fight?

1278
02:22:22,914 --> 02:22:26,111
They have weapons, horses...

1279
02:22:27,519 --> 02:22:28,508
And us?

1280
02:22:29,888 --> 02:22:31,219
What do we have?

1281
02:22:34,125 --> 02:22:35,615
Enough of bravado!

1282
02:22:36,528 --> 02:22:38,120
Thousands are leaving for lndia...

1283
02:22:38,463 --> 02:22:40,454
... we should go too.

1284
02:22:47,973 --> 02:22:50,066
A sparrow will challenge an eagle,

1285
02:22:53,678 --> 02:22:55,873
A sparrow will challenge an eagle,

1286
02:22:57,182 --> 02:22:59,173
A lamb will fight a lion,

1287
02:23:00,318 --> 02:23:03,287
One man will fight a million.

1288
02:23:04,122 --> 02:23:07,580
Guru Govind Singh, bless us!

1289
02:23:09,995 --> 02:23:12,429
A sparrow will challenge an eagle,

1290
02:23:12,597 --> 02:23:14,792
A lamb will fight a lion,

1291
02:23:15,033 --> 02:23:17,160
One man will fight a million.

1292
02:23:17,302 --> 02:23:19,429
Guru Govind Singh, bless us!

1293
02:24:13,892 --> 02:24:15,154
Come on.

1294
02:24:31,076 --> 02:24:33,271
Milkha. Are you alright, son?

1295
02:27:34,259 --> 02:27:35,248
Jai Hind sir.

1296
02:27:35,560 --> 02:27:37,790
Today, you won't
salute us, we salute you.

1297
02:27:38,763 --> 02:27:40,253
The whole unit salutes you.

1298
02:27:41,199 --> 02:27:42,291
lndia salutes you.

1299
02:27:43,668 --> 02:27:44,657
Proud.

1300
02:27:49,908 --> 02:27:55,175
Milkha, you are an officer now.

1301
02:28:01,653 --> 02:28:02,642
No.

1302
02:28:14,899 --> 02:28:18,995
All because of the pat on my back
and a kick on my butt from you sir.

1303
02:28:24,375 --> 02:28:25,501
Stay well, my son.

1304
02:28:26,578 --> 02:28:28,546
l wish you a thousand joys.

1305
02:28:35,486 --> 02:28:36,714
You have made me happy.

1306
02:28:38,990 --> 02:28:42,323
Congratulations to his friends!

1307
02:28:46,864 --> 02:28:50,925
Many many congratulation
for Milkhas winning.

1308
02:28:51,202 --> 02:28:54,296
Let's celebrate!

1309
02:30:01,406 --> 02:30:06,867
Bite through the electric fire

1310
02:30:07,645 --> 02:30:13,311
Chew the metal's
vibrating current

1311
02:30:13,518 --> 02:30:17,978
Set aflame your every pore

1312
02:30:18,289 --> 02:30:23,386
Without burning yourself
there's no glow

1313
02:30:56,427 --> 02:31:00,124
The flames are burning Milkha

1314
02:31:00,331 --> 02:31:03,698
Run Milkha

1315
02:31:03,935 --> 02:31:08,031
Run Milkha

1316
02:31:39,237 --> 02:31:41,228
Excuse me.
Can l have a photograph please?

1317
02:31:41,372 --> 02:31:42,361
Of course.

1318
02:31:44,108 --> 02:31:45,097
Thank you.

1319
02:31:47,245 --> 02:31:51,511
Son, you have made us proud.

1320
02:31:52,450 --> 02:31:54,884
Now make lndia's flag
flutter high at the Rome Olympics.

1321
02:31:55,119 --> 02:31:58,418
The hopes of all lndia ride on you.

1322
02:31:59,424 --> 02:32:02,689
l will run like
my life depends on it.

1323
02:32:03,761 --> 02:32:05,388
Wonderful.

1324
02:32:05,797 --> 02:32:09,494
Son, what can we do for you?

1325
02:32:12,637 --> 02:32:17,836
Panditji, if l win, can you
declare a national holiday?

1326
02:32:19,310 --> 02:32:20,538
Of course.

1327
02:32:23,981 --> 02:32:25,846
A call from Pakistan.

1328
02:32:26,818 --> 02:32:28,945
Gentlemen. Excuse me, please.
- Yes.

1329
02:32:35,026 --> 02:32:36,391
Ladies and Gentlemen.

1330
02:32:36,928 --> 02:32:39,192
An important announcement...

1331
02:32:39,764 --> 02:32:43,666
... what a coincidence that
while you are all here and...

1332
02:32:44,669 --> 02:32:50,039
... Pakistan's President,
Field Marshal Ayub Khan has called.

1333
02:32:51,309 --> 02:32:58,772
He has accepted my proposal
of the lndo-Pak friendship games.

1334
02:33:00,318 --> 02:33:03,549
lt's an important step
toward friendship...

1335
02:33:04,689 --> 02:33:06,486
... between our two nations.

1336
02:33:07,692 --> 02:33:08,681
l would like...

1337
02:33:09,494 --> 02:33:13,794
... Milkha Singh to
lead our contingent...

1338
02:33:14,198 --> 02:33:15,495
... to Pakistan.

1339
02:33:34,485 --> 02:33:35,952
All eyes were on Milkha.

1340
02:33:38,322 --> 02:33:40,916
But there was a storm
brewing in Milkha's head.

1341
02:35:19,523 --> 02:35:27,453
Milkha, run!

1342
02:35:28,899 --> 02:35:30,332
Run!

1343
02:35:31,636 --> 02:35:33,536
Why are you standing here?

1344
02:35:39,443 --> 02:35:41,308
Son. Son.

1345
02:35:41,846 --> 02:35:44,212
Listen to me...

1346
02:35:48,753 --> 02:35:50,721
... don't be scared.

1347
02:35:52,323 --> 02:35:53,756
No harm will come to you.

1348
02:35:54,592 --> 02:35:57,561
... don't be scared.

1349
02:35:58,129 --> 02:35:59,926
Son, be brave.

1350
02:36:00,898 --> 02:36:02,331
You'll be fine.

1351
02:36:04,602 --> 02:36:07,400
Run, Milkha! Run!

1352
02:36:07,605 --> 02:36:08,902
Get out of here.

1353
02:36:11,642 --> 02:36:21,017
Run, Milkha! Run!

1354
02:36:22,720 --> 02:36:24,915
Don't turn back to look!

1355
02:37:02,326 --> 02:37:07,923
So, Pakistan is a
terrible memory for Milkha...

1356
02:37:08,766 --> 02:37:12,725
... and we have come to
revive those memories.

1357
02:37:21,579 --> 02:37:27,142
We have reached Chandigarh.

1358
02:37:29,453 --> 02:37:30,920
We've reached.

1359
02:37:31,522 --> 02:37:33,387
But what shall we say to Milkha?

1360
02:37:37,762 --> 02:37:39,593
You have a nice garden.

1361
02:37:40,431 --> 02:37:43,923
lt seems gardening interests you.

1362
02:37:44,935 --> 02:37:45,924
Seems so.

1363
02:37:52,843 --> 02:37:59,612
lt has suddenly turned cold
in Chandigarh hasn't it?

1364
02:38:00,184 --> 02:38:01,276
You're right.

1365
02:38:09,727 --> 02:38:10,716
Thank you.

1366
02:38:23,974 --> 02:38:26,101
Sir, sugar?
- One spoon.

1367
02:38:30,781 --> 02:38:31,770
Thank you.

1368
02:38:40,257 --> 02:38:44,591
So much sugar, Milkha?

1369
02:38:46,297 --> 02:38:47,355
lt's not good for you.

1370
02:38:48,599 --> 02:38:50,624
Oh! That's mine...

1371
02:38:53,404 --> 02:38:57,067
You aren't here to discuss
the weather and sugar.

1372
02:39:00,644 --> 02:39:05,445
Milkha, Nehruji wants to meet you.

1373
02:39:13,557 --> 02:39:14,717
l can't do it sir.

1374
02:39:16,927 --> 02:39:18,622
My feet won't move.

1375
02:39:21,165 --> 02:39:23,998
My family's blood is in that air,
l won't be able to breathe.

1376
02:39:28,339 --> 02:39:29,328
Son...

1377
02:39:32,409 --> 02:39:36,971
You're a soldier.
Your country needs you now.

1378
02:39:38,282 --> 02:39:40,546
lf you must wage war
with your own self for it...

1379
02:39:42,753 --> 02:39:44,015
... then you should.

1380
02:41:47,311 --> 02:41:49,472
Right now, it's important..

1381
02:41:50,114 --> 02:41:53,174
Peace and harmony must
prevail between our countries.

1382
02:41:53,550 --> 02:41:58,078
Sports are an important
means to that goal.

1383
02:41:58,155 --> 02:41:59,588
That's all very well, sir...

1384
02:41:59,823 --> 02:42:02,383
... but why won't Milkha
Singh meet the press?

1385
02:42:04,361 --> 02:42:06,625
What's the problem?

1386
02:42:06,730 --> 02:42:09,255
Did he rebuff Khaliq's challenge?

1387
02:42:11,335 --> 02:42:12,996
Why the empty chair?

1388
02:42:13,637 --> 02:42:18,472
He knows coming to Pakistan...

1389
02:42:19,810 --> 02:42:21,300
... is a mistake.

1390
02:42:22,546 --> 02:42:26,346
Mr. Khaliq, can you defeat him?

1391
02:42:26,750 --> 02:42:27,739
God willing

1392
02:42:31,288 --> 02:42:34,553
But where is Milkha Singh?

1393
02:42:36,126 --> 02:42:40,620
Everyone, please sit down!

1394
02:44:26,537 --> 02:44:27,526
Mother!

1395
02:44:36,446 --> 02:44:37,435
Mother!

1396
02:44:46,023 --> 02:44:47,012
Mother!

1397
02:44:57,834 --> 02:44:58,823
Mother!

1398
02:45:13,383 --> 02:45:14,372
Mother!

1399
02:45:16,186 --> 02:45:17,175
Mother!

1400
02:45:20,057 --> 02:45:21,046
Mother!

1401
02:45:25,128 --> 02:45:26,117
Mother!

1402
02:45:59,596 --> 02:46:02,360
Mother!

1403
02:46:34,264 --> 02:46:35,288
Mother!

1404
02:47:10,367 --> 02:47:11,356
Mother!

1405
02:47:50,374 --> 02:47:51,773
Why are you crying?

1406
02:47:52,843 --> 02:47:54,936
Crying is no good.

1407
02:47:55,178 --> 02:47:56,338
Don't cry.

1408
02:48:01,284 --> 02:48:03,718
Your photo...

1409
02:48:20,070 --> 02:48:21,162
ls this you?

1410
02:48:23,507 --> 02:48:25,532
Red is the maiden's veil...

1411
02:48:32,816 --> 02:48:34,784
Red are tomatoes...

1412
02:48:41,725 --> 02:48:43,625
Red like Sampreet's butt!

1413
02:48:46,096 --> 02:48:47,529
... Milkha's butt.

1414
02:48:49,132 --> 02:48:50,121
Sampreet!

1415
02:48:51,802 --> 02:48:53,167
Milkha.

1416
02:48:59,109 --> 02:49:00,804
l thought you were...

1417
02:49:01,111 --> 02:49:02,305
l Survived...

1418
02:49:03,413 --> 02:49:04,573
l Survived...

1419
02:49:10,387 --> 02:49:13,288
People aren't bad, Milkha. But
circumstances can make them bad.

1420
02:49:14,157 --> 02:49:17,524
Partition was a bad time.
Remember our Muslim teacher...

1421
02:49:17,861 --> 02:49:21,126
... he raised me
and got me married.

1422
02:49:22,899 --> 02:49:23,888
Some milk?

1423
02:49:25,569 --> 02:49:28,561
You love it l'm told.
- Yes, sister-in-law.

1424
02:49:33,043 --> 02:49:36,638
Aren't you the Milkha
Singh who runs?

1425
02:49:42,652 --> 02:49:46,816
l am...

1426
02:49:50,694 --> 02:49:51,854
... the one who runs.

1427
02:50:01,538 --> 02:50:03,631
The connections are done,
start the radio.

1428
02:50:08,612 --> 02:50:09,806
Hey, change the station.

1429
02:50:10,514 --> 02:50:11,572
Just a minute.

1430
02:50:14,084 --> 02:50:19,351
Just by looking at
the Gaddafi stadium in Lahore...

1431
02:50:19,656 --> 02:50:24,855
... it seems as though
entire Pakistan has turned up...

1432
02:50:25,362 --> 02:50:30,959
... in lndia everyone's
heart is beating faster.

1433
02:50:34,704 --> 02:50:38,697
We can see the planes
throwing colour in the skies...

1434
02:50:38,808 --> 02:50:42,676
... and General Ayub
Khan of Pakistan...

1435
02:50:42,779 --> 02:50:46,681
... is entering the stadium
in his magnificent cavalcade.

1436
02:51:01,731 --> 02:51:04,632
Your Excellency, good morning.
- Welcome to Pakistan.

1437
02:51:04,801 --> 02:51:06,098
Thank you, sir.
- All the best.

1438
02:51:06,636 --> 02:51:08,627
Same to you, sir.
- Sir.

1439
02:51:12,108 --> 02:51:13,939
All the best.
- Thank you, sir.

1440
02:51:15,078 --> 02:51:16,568
Best of luck.
- Thank you, sir.

1441
02:51:17,781 --> 02:51:19,305
All the best.
- Thank you, sir.

1442
02:51:25,922 --> 02:51:29,187
All the best, Milkha Singh.
- Thank you, sir.

1443
02:51:30,827 --> 02:51:36,356
Khaliq.

1444
02:51:36,700 --> 02:51:39,328
Pakistan's hopes are riding on you.

1445
02:51:39,669 --> 02:51:42,137
l will do my best.

1446
02:51:43,106 --> 02:51:44,573
All the best.
- Thank you, sir.

1447
02:51:51,247 --> 02:51:53,306
And the tension is building.

1448
02:51:54,150 --> 02:51:58,348
lt's as if everyone
is breathing together,

1449
02:51:59,055 --> 02:52:01,717
... or rather everyone
has stopped breathing.

1450
02:52:10,333 --> 02:52:12,324
Leave them far behind you.

1451
02:52:13,770 --> 02:52:15,169
No one can defeat you.

1452
02:52:16,039 --> 02:52:17,666
No, Milkha.

1453
02:52:18,408 --> 02:52:21,741
You're the best. You're the champ.

1454
02:52:21,945 --> 02:52:23,742
Squad..

1455
02:52:23,980 --> 02:52:25,641
Go, my lion! Run!

1456
02:52:33,657 --> 02:52:34,646
Go, son.

1457
02:52:35,191 --> 02:52:36,180
Do it.

1458
02:52:37,293 --> 02:52:38,282
Yes.

1459
02:52:41,431 --> 02:52:42,557
Milkha Singh.

1460
02:52:44,401 --> 02:52:47,234
This could be the last
race of your life.

1461
02:52:48,605 --> 02:52:49,867
That's how l'll run it.

1462
02:52:53,610 --> 02:52:56,101
On your mark.

1463
02:53:19,936 --> 02:53:21,460
There is absolute silence...

1464
02:53:22,038 --> 02:53:24,529
... everyone's eyes
are on the race track.

1465
02:53:25,175 --> 02:53:26,335
Who will win?

1466
02:53:27,177 --> 02:53:29,839
lndia's hope Milkha Singh...

1467
02:53:31,281 --> 02:53:38,653
... or Pakistan's star athlete,
Asia's tornado, Abdul Khaliq.

1468
02:54:01,478 --> 02:54:03,036
Squad...

1469
02:54:07,984 --> 02:54:10,111
The gun is fired
and the race has begun.

1470
02:54:10,253 --> 02:54:13,586
Pakistan's Abdul Khaliq
is leading the pack...

1471
02:54:13,823 --> 02:54:16,053
... looks as though he has decided
to come and win today.

1472
02:54:16,259 --> 02:54:19,820
He seems to be reaching
his goal effortlessly.

1473
02:54:20,029 --> 02:54:25,831
Without a care, without a worry,
he is running towards the finish line.

1474
02:54:26,136 --> 02:54:29,572
Looks like his feet
are about to kiss victory.

1475
02:54:29,706 --> 02:54:32,072
Come on.
- Come on, son.

1476
02:54:38,681 --> 02:54:41,411
But wait a minute!
Something else is happening here...

1477
02:54:41,484 --> 02:54:44,783
... Milkha Singh is
suddenly catching up...

1478
02:54:44,854 --> 02:54:47,482
... and one by one
he is leaving everyone behind!

1479
02:54:47,690 --> 02:54:52,855
And with such ease he has now
overtaken Pakistan's Abdul Khaliq!

1480
02:54:53,029 --> 02:54:58,228
This can only be called a miracle which
we may not ever get to witness again.

1481
02:55:09,312 --> 02:55:12,247
lt seems as though
Milkha Singh has grown wings...

1482
02:55:12,282 --> 02:55:14,773
... the wind is
carrying him forward...

1483
02:55:14,884 --> 02:55:16,875
... or he is running
above the clouds.

1484
02:55:18,054 --> 02:55:19,078
Come on, Milkha.

1485
02:55:35,438 --> 02:55:41,570
Throw off all your
cares and troubles

1486
02:55:41,778 --> 02:55:48,013
The skeletons of the past

1487
02:55:48,351 --> 02:55:54,119
The soles of your
feet are like horse shoes

1488
02:55:54,424 --> 02:56:00,727
You've got to do it come what may

1489
02:56:10,240 --> 02:56:15,507
You are fire Milkha

1490
02:56:42,805 --> 02:56:45,433
Hail Mother lndia!

1491
02:56:54,717 --> 02:56:58,881
To celebrate Milkha Singh's
glorious victory in Pakistan...

1492
02:56:59,656 --> 02:57:03,649
... l propose a public
holiday in this honour.

1493
02:57:04,327 --> 02:57:07,421
Milkha has planted the lndian flag!

1494
02:57:08,631 --> 02:57:12,123
He's done it!

1495
02:59:47,256 --> 02:59:53,092
No one has ever run
like you did today.

1496
02:59:54,163 --> 02:59:57,394
You didn't run my son, you flew.

1497
02:59:59,435 --> 03:00:01,869
From now on the world
will know you as...

1498
03:00:02,772 --> 03:00:05,434
... 'The Flying Sikh.'

1499
03:00:06,509 --> 03:00:09,273
Pakistan bestows
this title upon you...

1500
03:00:09,846 --> 03:00:11,279
... with pride and honour.

1501
03:00:13,149 --> 03:00:15,743
Well done, my boy. Well done.

1502
03:00:51,354 --> 03:00:55,222
The world is lashing out at you.
Welcome the battle cry.

1503
03:00:55,358 --> 03:00:59,522
Your arms are like oars.
Feet that raise an uproar

1504
03:01:00,563 --> 03:01:04,090
Your every vein is iron ore.
You are fire Milkha.

1505
03:01:05,868 --> 03:01:09,804
Now you run Milkha

1506

O boat

1509
03:01:35,665 --> 03:01:39,328
O rod of steel.
Turn around the tides of fire

1510
03:01:39,368 --> 03:01:44,965

Your glory lies in sinking

1511
03:01:52,081 --> 03:01:58,179

Tear open the wheels of that chariot.
Turn it into the divine disc.
