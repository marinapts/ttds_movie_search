1
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,370
I had heard of demons...

2
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,540
For the first time I saw one!

3
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,290
No one should write or read about him!

4
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,199
There should be no trace of him

5
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,410
in the annals of history!

6
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,700
I am enforcing the Army

7
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,830
and signing a Death Warrant

8
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,240
of the biggest criminal in India!

9
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,330
This is ridiculous...

10
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,790
How can somebody write
something so careless...??

11
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,739
That too a Senior Journalist,

12
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,789
if he writes like this,

13
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,950
I am unable to believe it!

14
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,080
They wanted to publish this book too!

15
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,619
But the Government...

16
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,790
has banned this book then after seizing it,

17
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,410
they burnt all the copies...

18
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,239
From the Police Source

19
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,240
Now I have received
this one copy!

20
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,540
Deepa...

21
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,716
Call him for an interview...

22
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,620
Sir, I know that he is a Senior Journalist!

23
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,579
But, in this book...

24
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,450
I am unable to see a single truth!

25
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,699
I have an interview to take in Delhi...

26
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,180
And I am getting late for the flight!

27
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,910
If the Government itself, in
banning and seizing this book

28
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,409
has shown interest means

29
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,090
there must be some truth in it, is it not?

30
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,199
I may be the owner of this TV Channel,

31
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,660
But you are the face of it...

32
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,390
And you have to take your own decision!

33
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,660
But since 50 years

34
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,330
I have been observing Anand...

35
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,490
To even write a single word,

36
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,290
he thinks a hundred times...

37
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,740
He has written a whole book!

38
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,730
I will give you half an hour's time!

39
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,490
After that, you can find
someone else to do the job!

40
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,910
Shyam...
- Sir...

41
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:44,830
Arrange the Interview in the Archives room!

42
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,039
Send everybody outside...
- Hello everybody

43
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,539
Nobody should know about this...
- Please clear the room!

44
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:47,950
Leave... Leave...

45
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,320
I don't want a live recording...

46
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,450
All right sir!

47
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,740
We are journalists,

48
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,409
the smallest of things...

49
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,990
We hook, find and pull out!

50
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,829
In this book that you have written,

51
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,040
such a big thing...

52
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,580
It will give rise to a
deluge of questions...

53
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:24,990
These things directly
implicate big people...

54
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,846
Thinking, I will become a big officer,
I came to Bangalore...

55
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,119
Thought of staying here,
doing some odd jobs...

56
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,040
these scoundrels trouble me in office...

57
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,346
On one hand, without money I
cannot go to back to my village...

58
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,699
can't repay the loan, my father has taken!

59
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,910
Come to eat sir, come to eat!

60
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,990
Hey! Get lost!

61
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,136
Goddess Yellamma of Soudathi!

62
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,490
Give this poor man a little
courage and protect him!

63
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,490
Madam, for rape,

64
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,949
only men are to blame...

65
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:47,950
Shut up Mr. Nagaraj...

66
00:04:47,951 --> 00:04:49,579
I have had enough nonsense for today!

67
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,579
Oh God! What's this! This woman is behaving like
Goddess Durga! - We are going to take a short break!

68
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,579
To Deepa madam, in the Archives room,

69
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,580
who will serve tea man?

70
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,700
It's based on a true story...
You have written!

71
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,910
For this imagination of
yours, what records do have?

72
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,579
Will people read all this?

73
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,950
Will they believe all this?

74
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:10,870
Give me that book!

75
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,330
Now, will they read it?

76
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,870
Do you know what El Dorado means?

77
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,080
You Mean - The Lost City of Gold?

78
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,540
Since thousands of years,

79
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,489
knowing that there is a
Golden Kingdom, many kings...

80
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,909
In a mad bid to seek that,

81
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,789
have lost many armies!

82
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,430
Not a single soul was able to salvage it!

83
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,909
If anyone had got it,

84
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,950
he would have become the
greatest king of them all!

85
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,290
Isn't that so?

86
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:50,290
Possibly...

87
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,750
I have written this book
about someone like that!

88
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:54,790
But...

89
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:55,871
This is not an imagination,

90
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,240
to show that it is real,

91
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,290
in this world there is only one record!

92
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,160
What is buried in the sands...

93
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,780
The Symbolic Heroic Stone!

94
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:05,950
Symbolic Heroic Stone??

95
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,489
To wash clothes, the stone
that is next to the pond,

96
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:09,490
Not that stone!

97
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,990
In the stone,

98
00:06:10,991 --> 00:06:12,700
if his picture has been etched,

99
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,200
then he must have achieved something big!

100
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,950
That Symbolic Heroic Stone of yours

101
00:06:20,951 --> 00:06:22,151
however deep it may be buried,

102
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,200
I want to see it!

103
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,290
I want to see it...

104
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,120
The stone...

105
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
If it exists!

106
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,989
Get an excavation team ready!

107
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:31,990
Let it cost any amount!

108
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,120
Let's dig it out...

109
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,030
Where shall we send them sir?

110
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,100
Where is your Symbolic Heroic Stone??

111
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:40,950
Where is it?

112
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,200
Your...

113
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,790
El Dorado!

114
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,159
18km away from KGF town
you will get Baagnur...

115
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,160
From there, on the Baindoor road,

116
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,120
after 12 Km if you take left,

117
00:07:13,121 --> 00:07:14,409
after 4 Km you will get
a hill on the left...

118
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,539
Near that hill, there
is a Desert Palm tree...

119
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,579
surrounding the tree,
within 35 feet if you did,

120
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,266
you will find the Symbolic Heroic Stone...
Is what he has said sir!

121
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,659
Arrange a team,

122
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,620
leave today itself

123
00:07:22,621 --> 00:07:23,659
dig that and take it out...

124
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,660
Sir, are you serious?

125
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,240
In 3 days, it's my wedding sir!

126
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,386
Just because the old man
inside told, can we set off?

127
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,160
The man inside is Anand Ingaligi...

128
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,200
So I am damn serious!

129
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,040
Sir...

130
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,539
From 1950 to 1980,

131
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,740
All the papers are here...

132
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,080
A good many more papers, I have asked for,

133
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,329
but in all these papers, about KGF,

134
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,540
there is not a single article!

135
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,850
That's fine, leave these papers...

136
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:48,950
Leave this book!

137
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,410
Let's hear it from you!

138
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,400
From your mouth, let's hear it...

139
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,620
Who is that person?

140
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,289
Was he a hero...

141
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,290
Or was he a villain??

142
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,990
What happened in that place?

143
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,700
The gold found in KGF has enormous value!

144
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,990
But behind the hands that took it out,

145
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,620
There lies a huge history!

146
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,290
In the world, wherever gold is found,

147
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,700
it's found by chance!

148
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,159
In 1951

149
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,160
at a distance of 18 Km from KGF,

150
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,869
while farmers were digging a well,

151
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,540
they found a strange stone...

152
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,990
To investigate that,
government officers came,

153
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,120
with them Suryavardhan was present!

154
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,330
Mother!

155
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,910
It was destiny's act...

156
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,120
That night

157
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,910
two incidents occurred!

158
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,040
That place was discovered...

159
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,870
And he too was born!

160
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,119
Like how stones and boulders are found,

161
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,400
it's not that easy to find gold!

162
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,329
But Suryavardhan...

163
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,990
found all boulders to
be infested with gold!

164
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,120
He did not let even an atom of
dust to fly away from there...

165
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:48,080
You have given birth to
a son like an emperor...

166
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,330
My dear...

167
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,659
He doesn't have a father man...

168
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,539
The mother is suffering a lot!

169
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,740
Do you want a father??

170
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,159
Suryavardhan took that land

171
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,989
for Limestone Mining

172
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:36,200
for 99 years on lease!

173
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,829
To safeguard the secret...

174
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,489
He brought people by force

175
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:46,790
And started Mining.

176
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,739
Child...

177
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,329
To save your mother's life...

178
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,010
This much money is not sufficient my dear!

179
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,120
Marriage at 14...

180
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,160
A baby at 15...

181
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,870
A life full of sorrows...

182
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,239
At 25 years,

183
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,040
death had came searching for her!

184
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,449
But, to leave behind for her son...

185
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,200
She had only one asset!

186
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,160
Her last words...

187
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,619
Everyone thinks that if they money,

188
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,370
They can live a very peaceful life...

189
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,660
But,

190
00:11:28,661 --> 00:11:32,240
without money, one can't
even die peacefully...

191
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,330
This no one thinks about!

192
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,540
Give me your word...

193
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:47,080
I don't know how you will survive,

194
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,330
but when you die...

195
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,660
You must be dominant

196
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,040
As a immensely wealthy man...
You should die!

197
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,830
I will become a very wealthy man, mama...

198
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,330
She only showed him the goal,

199
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,699
But the path to reach it,

200
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,370
he had to choose it himself!

201
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,660
Give me money! Money! Money!

202
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,080
I don't have...

203
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,160
You don't have money?

204
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,120
Here take money...

205
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,330
Hey...

206
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,579
This is not enough for me...

207
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,620
I need more!

208
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,040
Not enough?

209
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,160
For trifles, you must beg...

210
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,370
For more, you have to thrash!

211
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,790
Power...

212
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,490
It's only if you have power,
will you have money...

213
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:58,870
Power...

214
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,160
Where will I find it??

215
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,290
For that dream,

216
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,410
he reached the city of friction, Bombay!

217
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,120
Scoundrel, get up...

218
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,120
This is my place!

219
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,200
Bombay, for the gold black market...

220
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,330
was the main place!

221
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,080
For this region,

222
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,290
two 2 gold smugglers...

223
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,160
Dubai's Inayat Khaleel

224
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,789
and Bombay's Shetty...

225
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,870
Between them endless war was on!

226
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:31,290
In this war another person entered!

227
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,160
Even though his slipper size was small,

228
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,660
That path where he laid
his footsteps was big!

229
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,450
Go...

230
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,290
Tell me your name!

231
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,910
Raja Krishnappa Beria.

232
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,329
In Bombay, if you do big tasks,
you will earn a big name!

233
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,080
Then even small names will be remembered...

234
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:49,580
Go!

235
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:55,080
Polish... Polish...

236
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,240
Shetty...

237
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,370
Everyone salutes him!

238
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,700
He is the king of Bombay!

239
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:03,120
That bloody Shinde,

240
00:14:03,121 --> 00:14:04,369
is troubling Shetty brother a lot!

241
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:05,450
We have to crack his head!

242
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,870
Are you crazy?

243
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,660
Who will dare hit an Inspector?

244
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:09,580
Will you hit him?

245
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,040
Will anyone in Bombay hit him?

246
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,910
Or will these kids hit him?

247
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,990
Will any of you hit the inspector, kids?

248
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,280
Is anybody like that here?

249
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,080
I found a man! Bugger!

250
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,239
Hey! Aslam Boss said it in jest

251
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,989
and you have seriously come to hit him!

252
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,370
Hey! Come man!

253
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:41,490
Let anyone call me a savage...

254
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,950
Let them repeatedly call me thus...
- Hey... Child!

255
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,540
What happened?

256
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,740
Let's go... Come man!

257
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:03,620
He...

258
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,159
He doesn't know my name!

259
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,160
What??

260
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,700
He...

261
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,540
He doesn't know who I am!

262
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,830
Who is that boy?

263
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,830
I want him!

264
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,409
Not a boy...

265
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:28,370
My name is Rocky,

266
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,870
you will remember it, right?

267
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:34,790
Rocky!

268
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:39,910
Sir, he is my boy sir...

269
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,700
I had made him sit in Andheri!

270
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,659
In jest I asked him to hit the police...
But he!

271
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,870
Don't worry about it man...

272
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,040
From the police, I have set him free!

273
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,200
Hey!

274
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:53,330
Where had you gone man?

275
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,660
Had gone to earn my name!

276
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,080
Why did you hit the policemen?

277
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,990
If you hit someone,

278
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,820
the police will search for you!

279
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,830
If you hit the police itself,

280
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,080
A Don like you will search!

281
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,580
Hey...

282
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,660
What do you want??

283
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,160
The world...

284
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,079
In 1978,

285
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,239
due to the crisis between
Iran and Afghanistan,

286
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,539
The enmity between United States

287
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,450
and Soviet Union had amplified!

288
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,830
The outcome impacted the whole world!

289
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,619
Along with oil, coffee,
steel and cotton prices...

290
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,540
Gold prices touched the skies!

291
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,159
By then, Suryavadhan

292
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,739
had reached a stature
that one one could touch!

293
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,289
To firmly establish this empire,

294
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:03,450
he had selected 5
partners as his 5 pillars!

295
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,869
After Barghav departed, his son Kamal

296
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,949
was taking the raw material
that came from KGF,

297
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,040
from that in the factory
he was extracting gold!

298
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,079
The gold that was extracted there

299
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,540
would be brought to Bangalore and the
responsibility of distributing it everywhere

300
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,440
was overseen by Rajendra Desai.

301
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,330
Andrews...

302
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,490
The western region was in his control!

303
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,290
Gurupandyan...

304
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,159
The political strength that he had

305
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,829
was supported by Suryavardhan

306
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,700
and entering national politics

307
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,240
He kept the government in his hands!

308
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,239
Suryavardhan's biggest strength was

309
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,990
his brother Adheera!

310
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,989
With his shrewdness, for
this fort that was built

311
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,699
Suryavardhan's son
Garuda too became a part!

312
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,539
Because of both of them, now KGF

313
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,740
was so well protected that no
one could point a finger at it!

314
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:50,040
But one day he got a stroke
and fell bedridden...

315
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:54,869
Everyone working under Suryavardhan,
who was in the jaws of death,

316
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,450
started desiring KGF!

317
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,369
For the first time in KGF,

318
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,160
shouts of mutiny were heard!

319
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,489
Due to the rise in gold prices,

320
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,869
greed had increased in Inayat Khaleel

321
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,950
He thought it to be the
right time to enter Bombay!

322
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,159
With Shetty's competitor, Dilawar

323
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,910
Inayath Khaleel joined hands with him

324
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,289
and to Bombay's Nagpade port,

325
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:18,700
He sent his gold.

326
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,329
But before that came,

327
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,910
Dilawar tried to take control of Bombay!

328
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,159
It is Dilwar's order...

329
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,840
We have to wipe off Shetty gang totally...

330
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,580
We must not leave anyone!

331
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,119
Did you put our boys in the prison?

332
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,370
Whose boys they are? Do you know that?

333
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,909
1st time after Independence

334
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,620
Bombay was on high alert

335
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:45,159
Dilwar was just about to
take control of Bombay,

336
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,240
But he had a huge problem...

337
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,119
Don... But Rocky?

338
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,239
Stop Salim brother!

339
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,040
We have not found him yet,

340
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,369
Once we find him, we will let you know...

341
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:55,370
You wait for now!

342
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,410
Did you find him??

343
00:18:56,411 --> 00:18:57,540
We have not yet found him...

344
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,310
Tell me... Tell me where is Rocky!

345
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:01,119
But we have put all the rest in prison!

346
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,120
What's the use...??

347
00:19:02,121 --> 00:19:03,369
First, catch him! Go...

348
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:04,699
Search for him man!

349
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,950
Search everywhere...

350
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,440
What??

351
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,390
They have caught Rocky Boss...

352
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:16,980
We found him, come!

353
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:27,650
Kill him!

354
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,229
My father told me about him!

355
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:44,940
My son...

356
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,060
Don't challenge the typhoon!

357
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,650
Hey! Go man!

358
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,350
Tell my father!

359
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,689
Your son...

360
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,440
Has hung the typhoon itself!

361
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:55,440
What is it Aslam?

362
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:56,939
Your faces are so glum?

363
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,980
Is anyone dead or what?

364
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,060
Hey kiddo,

365
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,456
go and get a Biryani Rice...

366
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,920
Why are you looking at me like that?

367
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,020
Go my boy!

368
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,770
They have caught Rocky!

369
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:08,350
They have found Rocky...

370
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,350
Get the stuff and come!

371
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,649
Hey...

372
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,650
Come on...

373
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:14,850
Inayath Khaleel's boats
will reach our port...

374
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,520
Bombay will be lost to us!

375
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,810
Today's my birthday...

376
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,060
As a present,

377
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,480
his heart...

378
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,940
And his eyes, I want both!

379
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,189
What all do all of you want, tell me!

380
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:40,099
Kill him!

381
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,100
Kiddo...

382
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,310
Cancel the Kushka,

383
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:44,690
bring a proper Biriyani,

384
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,650
With that get more onions...

385
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,940
Now go...

386
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:49,900
Kill him! Kill him!

387
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,019
The smell of blood has made

388
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,480
all the Piranha fish to come together!

389
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,849
Since the past 15 years,
the work that you were not able to do,

390
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:58,650
your son has accomplished
it in a single day!

391
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,600
But those fish did not know,

392
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,900
that blood

393
00:21:01,901 --> 00:21:04,440
was that of the shark that would hunt them!

394
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:09,560
Happy Birthday To You...
- Kill him!

395
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:15,020
Happy Birthday To You...

396
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,350
Where is he??

397
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,480
They have hung him...

398
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:21,980
Happy Birthday To You...
- Not him... Where is my son??

399
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,230
Your son...

400
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,480
He is in front of him!

401
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:28,730
Happy Birthday To You...

402
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,599
Happy Birthday...

403
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,190
Hey! You don't hang the typhoon!

404
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,440
What are you watching??

405
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,440
Kill him!

406
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:43,190
Happy Birthday To You...
- We run from the typhoon!

407
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:52,099
'Bombay is mine' those who used
to roam the roads saying so...

408
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,770
He has brought them all together!

409
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,980
All of them, in the very same roads...

410
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,980
He will chase and kill them!

411
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,650
My blood also seems to be red guys!

412
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,980
When I was a kid itself, I came to Bombay!

413
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,480
It was like falling into a furnace!

414
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,810
On these very roads...

415
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,099
When I asked for two meals a day,
they hit me up...

416
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,810
To sleep, when I asked for three
feet of space... They beat me!

417
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,350
But Bombay did not know then...

418
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,440
What was fallen in the furnace, was iron!

419
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,649
Banging it several times

420
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,019
and hitting it over and again

421
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,190
it has now become a knife!

422
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,310
A knife knows only one thing...

423
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:50,400
Does Bombay belong to your father??

424
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,559
No man...

425
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,690
It's your father's!

426
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,310
And your father...

427
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,230
I am he!

428
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,900
Kill...
Kill him!

429
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:37,770
Kill him!

430
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,060
Why man?

431
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,229
You are scared seeing how I hit them?

432
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,979
To them, I just said cheers and sipped!

433
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,349
For you, I will have Bottoms-Up...

434
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,810
and lick the pickle!

435
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,600
Run!

436
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,940
Come on, come on man!

437
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:05,650
Come! Come!

438
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:18,520
Come on...

439
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,520
Stop him man!

440
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,020
He is coming... Stop him man!

441
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:49,730
He is coming...

442
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,900
He is coming!

443
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,230
He is coming...

444
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,520
Brother!

445
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,980
Brother!

446
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:53,900
Hey...

447
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,310
Where is the butcher's knife?

448
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:05,520
If Bombay faces the ocean on one side!
- Hey... Stop! Stop! Stop!

449
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,150
On the other side is Rocky!

450
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,650
Even the waves, to come
and touch the shore here...

451
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:12,809
Go back... Go back...

452
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:15,400
Go! Go! Go! Go back!
- They have to seek his permission!

453
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,770
Turn it! Turn it! Turn it!

454
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,020
Go! Go! Go!

455
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,100
Tell me...

456
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:43,901
The right guy to dig a pit for the
elephant... In Bombay we have found!

457
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,100
Rocky!

458
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,850
Inayath Khaleel's ship
is going back Boss...

459
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:58,690
What Boss?

460
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,270
Was Bombay saved??

461
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,600
An order to stop!

462
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,600
Ruling over life!

463
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,850
Ruling over death!

464
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:32,729
He is the life of Mumbai...

465
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:33,650
The very life man!

466
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:35,559
Don't dare stare at his eyes!

467
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,520
Lightning will strike...
Run away!

468
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,519
Fire and storm,
Whenever they unite!

469
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,350
A dynamite like him is born!

470
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,149
Oh! God!

471
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,400
Look here!

472
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,019
If he comes to rule,
He is the emperor!

473
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,229
If you oppose him...
He is the very devil!

474
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,849
Oh God!

475
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,060
Please stop him!

476
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:55,099
The hidden one is acquired!

477
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,769
The one who revolts is captured!

478
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:58,730
In the streets of Mumbai,

479
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,810
With fright they will say 'Salute'!

480
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,439
Salute Rocky Don!

481
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,100
Ra... Ra... Rocky!

482
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,350
Salute Rocky Don!

483
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,810
Salute Rocky Don!

484
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,940
Salute Rocky Don!

485
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:16,020
This locality is yours Don!!

486
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:18,310
You are everyone's boss!

487
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,860
From Africa, the gold
that was coming directly

488
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,349
through the coast guards

489
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,020
was getting unloaded at the Bombay port!

490
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,810
From there under police security,

491
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,310
in grey coloured marked truck,

492
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:29,400
Rocky used to get the material...

493
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:32,440
The sealed boxes, in his absence,
were never opened!

494
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,900
He used to check it and
to all other places...

495
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,810
he himself distributed it,
through the Goods Train!

496
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:41,099
Without Rocky's orders,

497
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,480
in Bombay, no decisions were being taken!

498
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,559
The one who held your
finger and made you walk...

499
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,519
The one who taught you your first words...

500
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,520
Her words are sacred!

501
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,059
One who has grown with fire!

502
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,059
Persistently moving ahead!

503
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,100
A warrior who has taken an oath!

504
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,350
Where can you find an army to stop him?

505
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:43,149
Is it possible to control a surging wave?

506
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,059
He is filled with character!
His hand is like iron!

507
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,149
He sells fear,
cares nothing for life!

508
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,809
Move away...

509
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:50,060
There's danger!

510
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:53,070
The hidden one is acquired!
- It can't be done!

511
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,850
The one who revolts is captured!

512
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,019
In the streets of Mumbai,

513
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,770
With fright they will say 'Salute'!

514
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:00,810
What is it man??

515
00:30:00,811 --> 00:30:02,456
The clothes for wash, we
had come to give brother...

516
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,849
I too came for washing only!

517
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:04,850
Pour it!

518
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,229
Salute Rocky Don!

519
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,900
Ra... Ra... Rocky!

520
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,150
Salute Rocky Don!

521
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,600
Salute Rocky Don!

522
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,730
Salute Rocky Don!

523
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:19,810
This locality is yours Don!!

524
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,100
You are everyone's boss!

525
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,770
Henceforth Inayath Khaleel's
men won't ever bother us...

526
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,480
Everything is fine... Let it be!

527
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,560
Because of Rocky!

528
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:33,229
That shooter of yours...

529
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,810
Is accomplishing so much...

530
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,350
Is it for Shetty
or is it for Bombay??

531
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,940
We are all with you Shetty Don...

532
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,189
But... It is beacuse Rocky is with us

533
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,440
that we all are so bold!

534
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,519
Rocky's name, not only in Bombay

535
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,399
but in the entire South Coast...
It is being heard!

536
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,150
Rocky brother,

537
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:01,690
What Rocky brother??

538
00:31:01,691 --> 00:31:03,189
Today, how many people did you kill??

539
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:03,850
After the day ends,

540
00:31:03,851 --> 00:31:05,810
I will count and tell you! You go!

541
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,520
Greetings Don!
Greetings Don!

542
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:12,810
Greetings Don!

543
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,150
In Bombay, everybody salutes you...

544
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,270
Other than Rocky...

545
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,399
Rocky likes your chair a lot!

546
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,650
If he feels he has the same right to it...

547
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,380
Then it will become very difficult!

548
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,810
It's only till the nest is built...

549
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,910
That the silk worm's life span extends!

550
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,020
After that...

551
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,190
They are just put in hot water!

552
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:50,810
Hey Pathan!

553
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:51,480
Yes Boss!

554
00:31:51,481 --> 00:31:52,850
In this Bombay city...

555
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,599
Even if our address
does not have a pincode,

556
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,770
we get the post!

557
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,099
Do you know why??

558
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,439
That's because our name is so famous!

559
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,440
Yes Boss!

560
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,850
Can everybody become like you Boss?

561
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,689
Some people hit ten people

562
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,350
and think that they have become a 'Don'!

563
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,480
Rocky!

564
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:12,350
In Bangalore, you have to
finish a task for me...

565
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,560
If you do that...

566
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:16,060
The whole of Bombay...

567
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,310
Will be yours!

568
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,649
The post arrives,

569
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,520
not by looking at the
address on the letter!

570
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:50,650
It is due to the landmark
that is on the address!

571
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,190
For this landmark, forget the pincode...

572
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,560
You won't even need a stamp!

573
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,690
A golden bank...

574
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:04,100
They are using to cash trifling coins!

575
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,559
Hey Pathan!

576
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,560
Yes Boss!

577
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:23,150
I am not someone who hit ten
people and became a 'Don',

578
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:27,270
All the ten people I hit were Dons!

579
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,020
Yes Boss!

580
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,689
Shetty saluting someone else...

581
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:41,809
I saw it for the first time!

582
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:44,190
Looks like he decides
what happens in Bombay!

583
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,599
That Shetty won't leave us,

584
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,729
he will do something or the other to us...

585
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:47,979
So what are we?
Are we wearing bangles or what??

586
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,150
You shut up man!

587
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:51,150
Don't you worry about Shetty!

588
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,600
All the boys are with you...

589
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,349
You used to ask always...

590
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,400
'I want Bombay'!

591
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,480
Now the time has come!

592
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:58,349
Now you...

593
00:34:58,350 --> 00:34:59,900
You will be the King of Bombay!

594
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,980
How deep is the ocean?

595
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,100
What??

596
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,980
Without knowing the depth,
you can't rule over it...

597
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,400
Let's dive and find that out!

598
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,809
To further my dreams of nearing El Dorado

599
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:16,810
I got a twist...

600
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,760
Bangalore!

601
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,050
Stop the car near a bar!

602
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,640
It's election time today sir...
The bar will not even be open!

603
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,070
Why are you running like this...

604
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:38,780
What happened??

605
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:40,370
Rajendra Desai's daughter sir!

606
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:41,619
In some hotel...
Just because they didn't serve drinks,

607
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,909
she has blocked the road...
And is partying right here sir!

608
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,949
Everyone who is looking
at her is being hit!

609
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,279
Don't go there sir... Come away sir...

610
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,069
Help me... Help me!

611
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,070
Sir...

612
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,370
Sir help me!

613
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:54,820
The one who is coming...

614
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,030
Is he a sharp shooter?

615
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:56,780
No...

616
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,160
I don't even know how his marksmanship is!

617
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,490
Then how did you trust him?

618
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,070
When a hit is ordered

619
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,030
A lot of procedures are followed...

620
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,619
Sir, sir... Come sir!

621
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,780
Don't try to save him sir!

622
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,750
They are not good people... Come away sir!

623
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,069
Eyes should not falter...

624
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,270
The hand should not tremble...

625
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:14,200
The breathe should be held...

626
00:36:14,201 --> 00:36:16,121
We should check the
position we are standing in!

627
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:17,739
In which direction the air flows...

628
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,030
We should keep in mind!

629
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:21,780
He...

630
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,570
Will directly point on the forehead...

631
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,940
And will pull the trigger...

632
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,069
Sharp shooters are meant...

633
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,160
Only for the Olympics!

634
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,780
It's a lot of risk that
we are working in...

635
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,449
Even if we don't,

636
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:34,660
it's a huge risk, is it not?

637
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,910
Smoke... Have a smoke!

638
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,780
Let your sorrows be gone!

639
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:03,569
Say throughout the day...

640
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:10,409
Praise be to Lord Krishna!
Praise be to Lord Ram!

641
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:11,410
Congratulations!

642
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:12,660
Smoke... Have a smoke!
- Why??

643
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,450
Smoke... Have a smoke!
- I love you!

644
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,319
How dare you!

645
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,570
How fair are you!

646
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:22,910
What are you looking at?

647
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:23,910
Come hit him guys...

648
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,320
Where was I...

649
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:47,450
I am already dead, my dear!

650
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:01,160
Hey guys!
Go!! Go hit him...

651
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:29,279
What happened guys?
You won't attack me?

652
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,280
Guys! Go!

653
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:50,660
Hey guys! Go hit him!

654
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:56,450
Now come on man...

655
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:05,610
What are you looking at?? Go!!

656
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,529
You damn rogue...

657
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:34,490
You are wasting liquor!
You are wasting liquor!

658
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:43,950
Do you know the value of liquor?!

659
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:46,870
Only drunkards know the value of liquor!

660
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:00,740
Looks like you have come
for the first time to Bangalore!

661
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,870
You still don't know about me...

662
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,120
After getting to know, don't run and hide!

663
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:07,069
My father will find you wherever you are

664
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:09,530
and drag you to this
very road and hit you up!

665
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,779
We don't have a habit of running away

666
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,570
but we do have a habit of chasing!

667
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,909
In my journey

668
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:18,990
I have seen a good lot of smart guys...

669
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,450
But...

670
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,700
A lady who kills...

671
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,620
I am seeing for first time!

672
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:28,490
I have deeply falling in love with you...

673
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:29,990
Shut up! Rocky!

674
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,370
Shut up!

675
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:33,270
Who did you say your father was?

676
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:34,660
Rajendra Desai!

677
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:37,820
He has taken care of
you in a very rich way!

678
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,120
I will take care of you in much better way!

679
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:40,950
Don't worry!

680
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,530
Leaving you, I will not go anywhere!

681
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,620
I will come soon!

682
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,819
Henceforth her father is my father-in-law

683
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,319
and I am your brother-in-law!

684
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,820
Your sister...

685
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:54,370
Take good care of her!

686
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,200
Do take good care of her!

687
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,819
This is the address you told sir...

688
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:09,069
Finish your work and go away sir!

689
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,830
Once again don't come
back to Bangalore sir!

690
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,240
Kamal...

691
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:31,870
What happened??

692
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,570
Bangalore is very big... It seems!

693
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,830
Searching for him is difficult...
I believe!

694
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,530
It must be someone new...

695
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:45,710
Single-handedly he has hit up all our boys!

696
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:47,870
Being drunk...

697
00:41:47,871 --> 00:41:49,120
With my Reena itself!

698
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:53,119
Airport, railway station,
bus-stand, highways...

699
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,239
Everything should be shut down!

700
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,160
That son of a gun!

701
00:41:55,161 --> 00:41:56,721
For no reason should be able to escape!

702
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:02,409
He would have taunted Reena...

703
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:03,410
I know this!

704
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:05,660
Don't bring him here again Daya...

705
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,740
Kamal! If your stars are not right...

706
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:10,620
He will get caught by them somewhere!

707
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,950
Do you know whose people
you have hit and come?

708
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,700
Do you know who that girl is??

709
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:27,740
Who?

710
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,570
Rajendra Desai's daughter

711
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:31,450
Reena!

712
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:35,670
I had returned without
asking about her name!

713
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:37,950
Reena...!

714
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,989
What a sweet name!

715
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,990
Why do you think we have called you here?!

716
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:43,529
Right from when I came

717
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:45,820
we are dilly-dallying outside the garden!

718
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:48,820
Shall we come into the story?

719
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:51,870
What is the task, tell me sir!

720
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,320
You have to kill a mammoth!

721
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,530
What is our plan

722
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:04,120
that will be explained to you by Daya!

723
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:06,279
In a few days...

724
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,400
A huge function is to occur!

725
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:09,490
Before he reaches the function...

726
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:13,190
On the road! He should be killed!

727
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,096
To reach the place where
that function is happening...

728
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,120
There are only two roads!

729
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:20,370
The way I see it,

730
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:23,010
He will enter from the main road only!

731
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,320
It's a big road...

732
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:25,690
Even people will be less there...

733
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:27,260
There won't be any traffic congestion!

734
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,160
Which is the other road?

735
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,370
Those are small roads!

736
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:34,989
Buildings all over,

737
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:36,570
bus stop, market...

738
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:38,070
No place to even move around!

739
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:39,410
What I feel is...

740
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,420
There is no chance of him taking that road!

741
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:44,210
This function...
Where does it take place!

742
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,530
In the DYSS new party office!

743
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:50,660
MLA's,

744
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:51,200
MP's,

745
00:43:51,201 --> 00:43:52,319
High Court Judges

746
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,160
and Central Ministers

747
00:43:53,161 --> 00:43:54,199
everyone will be there!

748
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,846
The security is now in
the hands of the centre!

749
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:57,069
The Chief Minister's name...
Will be announced!

750
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:57,490
Hey...

751
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:59,070
Bring the lime man!

752
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:01,750
The Chief Minister's name...
Will be announced!

753
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:03,670
There... Touching him is also impossible!

754
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,660
The one who is coming...
Do you have his photo!

755
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:12,570
His photo is not needed!

756
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:15,570
If he comes the whole of
Bangalore will come to know!

757
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:23,740
Reena!

758
00:44:23,741 --> 00:44:25,160
He will surely be caught!

759
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,450
After we catch him!

760
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,159
Henceforth you are my responsibility

761
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,409
I will take good care of you...

762
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:33,050
You have told this to my father... Right!

763
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:34,739
Your are taking very good care of me!

764
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:35,740
Kamal!

765
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,200
Who are you??

766
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,240
He has taken this very lightly sir!
Andrews Sir..

767
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:57,410
What is happening here??

768
00:44:57,411 --> 00:44:59,029
Who is going to come here??
He still has not realised...

769
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,410
What is happening here??

770
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,240
Who is coming here...
If he was aware!

771
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,910
In this universe...
No one would have come!

772
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:09,619
Let him do his work...

773
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:11,780
Just keep him far away
from Kamal, that's all!

774
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:16,320
Two days ago,

775
00:45:16,321 --> 00:45:18,449
forty five boys have come to write an exam

776
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:19,529
and are staying in Bell Hotel!

777
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:22,006
Matching his personality
A lot of people are there, it seems...

778
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:23,780
Since all the boys are in the hospital,

779
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:25,450
there is no one to identify him!

780
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:28,870
There is one person!

781
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:36,409
Don't leave anybody out of the hotel,

782
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:37,570
Every room should be checked!

783
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:39,990
Get that door opened!

784
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:40,820
What do you want??

785
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:41,820
What's the matter??
- No

786
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:44,410
Get that opened...

787
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:45,660
No!

788
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:46,910
No!

789
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:47,530
Madam...

790
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:48,200
Is it him?

791
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:48,990
No!

792
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:49,990
What about him??

793
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:52,490
No!

794
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,240
Hey! Who are you??

795
00:45:57,450 --> 00:45:57,910
Hey! Who are you??

796
00:45:58,030 --> 00:45:58,910
Who have you come from??

797
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:00,530
What work do you have??
Tell me!

798
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,070
You...

799
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:07,870
Came...

800
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:08,990
To see me...

801
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:11,176
Even you weren't able to
be away from me darling!

802
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,840
There is no chance you will believe this!

803
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:15,069
Just now I was thinking of you...
In the bathroom...

804
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:16,070
I was having a bath!

805
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,660
I'm going to kill you!

806
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,370
I am already dead, my dearest!

807
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,529
Now I like you all the more!

808
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,870
You block the road to have a drink...

809
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:26,699
To hit me up you come with boys...

810
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,320
To the place where I am!

811
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:30,819
You even threaten my life!

812
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:32,449
Hey! Open the door!

813
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:34,070
Now you are right next to me darling!

814
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:34,910
My darling!

815
00:46:34,911 --> 00:46:36,370
I am like an express train...

816
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,409
You are like the track!

817
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:39,869
Both of us together...

818
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:42,029
Can Chug along... Chug along!
Chug along!

819
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:43,239
And keep going!

820
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:44,030
Hey! Open the door!

821
00:46:44,031 --> 00:46:45,369
Hey! Who are you??

822
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:46,410
Just a minute, my dear!

823
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:52,029
When your sister and
brother-in-law are in a room...

824
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:53,030
They should not been disturbed!

825
00:46:53,031 --> 00:46:54,296
That much... Don't you guys know!

826
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,320
What is it guys?!

827
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:56,200
Hey!

828
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,160
Hit him!

829
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,160
Kill him! Hit him!

830
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,240
Driver!

831
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,740
Oh! God!

832
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:09,610
Did you hit the driver too??

833
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,960
Why do you get so upset
about that, my dear!?

834
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,030
I am here!

835
00:47:13,031 --> 00:47:14,070
Come, I will drop you!

836
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:15,489
How is the Driver's
attire looking on me dear?

837
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:16,490
Are you impressed?

838
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:18,296
I will also put on the
Watchman's attire if you want!

839
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,570
Even then, your driver has
a lot of guts, my dear!

840
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:21,530
Even after I hit so many people...

841
00:47:21,531 --> 00:47:22,771
Bravely he came in front of me!

842
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:24,739
Henceforth like this...
Don't come out my dear!

843
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:26,449
I understand the urgency...

844
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:27,450
Let's get married soon!

845
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:28,699
And after you get married!

846
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:31,216
On the threshold I will not
make you kick the auspicious rice...

847
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,520
I will keep a beer bottle there!

848
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:34,200
You come and kick the bottle!

849
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,370
Stop the car!

850
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:37,910
What happened my dear??

851
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:38,740
What happened??

852
00:47:38,741 --> 00:47:40,370
How dare you to talk to me like that...

853
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:41,070
You idiot!

854
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,006
You are not even worthy of
standing in front of me!

855
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:44,370
You have come and sat next to me!

856
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,490
You are not aware of what my status is...

857
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:49,220
A man like you... I will like??
How did you even imagine that?!

858
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:02,410
After hitting four people you
feel that you are a hero??

859
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:32,870
You illiterate brute!

860
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:33,870
One minute, my dear!

861
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,030
What the hell man!

862
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:42,070
Take out the car...

863
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,280
Take out the Damn Car!

864
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:46,030
Take it out... Man!

865
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,620
If I polish eight boots
then I would get a bun!

866
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:38,989
The rice in a plate is spilt
and eaten by such people...

867
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:40,159
In their midst,

868
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,739
the bun that has fallen in the mud...

869
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:43,279
If you are struggling so much for it...

870
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,530
Your situation I can understand!

871
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:48,370
Selfishness is making the world go around!

872
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,530
It won't stop for anyone!

873
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:52,950
We have to hold and stop it...

874
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,870
Don't worry about them!

875
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,740
None of them are as strong as you are,

876
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:05,780
in this entire universe there is
no soldier... Better than a mother!

877
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:39,910
Darling you were telling
me something, my dear!

878
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:47,990
Take me to your home!

879
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,320
OK!

880
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:14,950
Someone came in between...
See that!

881
00:51:14,951 --> 00:51:15,990
Clear that vehicle...

882
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:18,070
Hey! Take the vehicle out!

883
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:53,120
Sir...

884
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:54,530
Greetings...

885
00:51:54,531 --> 00:51:55,611
My name is Anand Ingalgi...

886
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:56,949
I had called you earlier...

887
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:57,950
I am a journalist...

888
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,279
Whatever I ask about him...
No one even dares to speak about sir...

889
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,800
At least if you could...
- Come inside!

890
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:04,029
You don't worry sir

891
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:05,830
Your name will not be
published in the paper!

892
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:07,699
Put my name prominently

893
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:08,530
Nagaraju...

894
00:52:08,531 --> 00:52:09,990
Son of Kaalegowda...

895
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,120
Write it down!

896
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:12,700
Now ask me...

897
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:13,200
Sir...

898
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:14,700
Before he became a Rowdy

899
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:17,369
When he was in Bombay
He had a different name, I heard...

900
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:19,030
Raja Krishnappa Beria...

901
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:20,780
How did it become Rocky sir...

902
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,700
Day... mond!

903
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:25,200
Since 1925

904
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:26,530
What does that mean?

905
00:52:26,531 --> 00:52:28,369
It means... The year
the Company was formed!

906
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:29,409
Why do they put it thus?

907
00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:30,950
For Brands... That is what they do!

908
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:32,620
A Brand means?

909
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:34,410
The name has a value...

910
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:36,200
That all will know about!

911
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:39,320
At a very young age, he
decided to become a Brand...

912
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:40,530
A Brand?

913
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,380
I will tell you about
an incident, listen...

914
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,780
Sir, he has driven the vehicle
rashly at 100 Km speed,

915
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:48,280
he has even smashed the Check-post!

916
00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:49,240
Neither are the vehicle documents there,

917
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:49,950
nor is the license...

918
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:50,870
He has called someone...

919
00:52:50,871 --> 00:52:52,240
To bring the documents, I think!

920
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:54,370
When you ask his name,
he is not saying that too!

921
00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:56,490
Do you have matches?

922
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:59,529
In my Station, you are
smoking in front of me?

923
00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:00,699
He screamed at thunder itself...

924
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:01,950
Who cares for your riches!

925
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,699
Whoever you might be,
yoou are first a slave of law!

926
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:04,320
A slave!

927
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:06,096
To even say your name,
you are acting smart!

928
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:07,569
Speak up!

929
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:08,530
He thundered once...

930
00:53:08,531 --> 00:53:10,030
I will set you right!
You rogue!

931
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:12,910
The whole Station shook!

932
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,370
The Driving License...

933
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:41,070
Hey... Give a chair!

934
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:44,320
Where is it?!

935
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:47,120
Found it!

936
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:50,029
Even though many had not seen him,

937
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:51,280
his name was known to all...

938
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:56,070
Rocky!

939
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:07,950
Since...

940
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,910
1951

941
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:13,319
Sir...
He is such a big criminal brand...

942
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,869
How do you accept that?

943
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:16,820
I have put a golden ring
to that hand of law...

944
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,910
It will shake hands with me,

945
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,870
and will salute me too!

946
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:23,160
Police whistled and caught a Rowdy,

947
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:26,370
but people whistled and cheered for him
and he became a king!

948
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:28,370
After they accepted...

949
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:30,279
Not a slave...

950
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,699
Who are we to deny it?

951
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:33,200
The Chief!

952
00:54:36,370 --> 00:54:44,370
The King! The King!

953
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:55,990
Sir...

954
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:57,980
You have gone ahead in the story!

955
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:01,030
How far ahead have I gone?

956
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,530
Too far ahead...

957
00:55:16,570 --> 00:55:17,910
When did I ask for a coffee...

958
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:18,990
Kindly excuse me madam!

959
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:26,850
Rocky's curiosity was piqued!

960
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,309
The marked trucks that were
supposed to be in the Bombay Port,

961
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:33,310
what were they doing in Bangalore
under police protection??

962
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:35,559
This inexplicable secret
that he did not fathom!

963
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:36,560
He went behind it!

964
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:04,640
In Bombay,

965
00:56:04,641 --> 00:56:08,180
the boxes of gold could
never have gone past Rocky.

966
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:11,010
Rocky, who was only concerned
with opening the seal,

967
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:14,020
never bothered to think about the
hands that sealed the boxes.

968
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:17,469
Seeing those boxes in this godown,

969
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:18,969
one thing was confirmed to him!

970
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:21,770
The gold was not coming from Africa!

971
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:24,519
More than worrying about why this secrecy,

972
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,320
the only thing that
remained in his head was,

973
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:28,680
where was this Gold coming from

974
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:31,390
and whose hands were behind this!!

975
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:36,969
Breaking news! DYSS Party has...

976
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:37,970
In the State elections

977
00:56:37,971 --> 00:56:39,929
In Goa, Maharashtra and Karnataka

978
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:41,929
For the fifth consecutive
time, has recorded a win!

979
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:45,139
Under the leadership of Gurupandiyan,
this party's flag that flew high

980
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:47,180
shows no signs of coming down again!

981
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:51,679
The Election Results have come in,

982
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:52,600
the time is too short...

983
00:56:52,601 --> 00:56:54,929
But only the CM's name is being
announced in this small function,

984
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:57,389
will he take the risk and surely come to
Bangalore for this, what is the guarantee?

985
00:56:57,390 --> 00:57:00,429
To call him from there,
there is just one idea,

986
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:02,180
first we have to cater to his ego!

987
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:03,680
How?

988
00:57:03,681 --> 00:57:05,679
Make a statue of his father!

989
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:06,470
A statue?

990
00:57:06,471 --> 00:57:08,469
Placing it in front of the party office

991
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:10,559
and announce that we are inaugurating it...

992
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,809
He will come without fail!

993
00:57:11,810 --> 00:57:13,349
Till he is inside that fort,

994
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:15,060
No one can touch him!

995
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:19,430
Even then if he does venture out,

996
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,470
It will not mean that has no army!

997
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:26,720
Hey... Lay off!

998
00:57:26,721 --> 00:57:29,361
If Brother is not there,
you will keep fighting amongst yourselves!

999
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:31,600
Vaanaram sir!

1000
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:32,270
John,

1001
00:57:32,271 --> 00:57:34,519
the young master will
surely go to Bangalore!

1002
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,930
You too should leave for there!

1003
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:38,560
Don't forget...

1004
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,349
This will be our last chance!

1005
00:57:40,350 --> 00:57:41,850
Your Bombay shooter....

1006
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:43,220
Is he ready?

1007
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:50,520
Where is she?

1008
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:53,350
Where is she?

1009
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:13,769
Be cautious!

1010
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:17,219
I'm a lightning like vine...

1011
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:21,099
Eyes like the edge of a sword!

1012
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:24,849
In the trap, it's when you fall...

1013
00:58:24,850 --> 00:58:27,970
Will you realize this plot!

1014
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:30,269
Be cautious!

1015
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:33,969
I'm a lightning like vine...

1016
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:37,849
Eyes like the edge of a sword!

1017
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:41,599
In the trap, it's when you fall...

1018
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:44,720
Will you realize this plot!

1019
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,179
When the slender waist gyrates,

1020
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:04,969
When it swings!

1021
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:07,719
You be ecstatic then!

1022
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:10,349
The arrows of mischievous smile...

1023
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:12,349
When they hit you, you clever one!

1024
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:15,389
You will be my prisoner then!

1025
00:59:15,390 --> 00:59:17,929
When the slender waist gyrates,

1026
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:19,719
When it swings!

1027
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:22,469
You be ecstatic then!

1028
00:59:22,470 --> 00:59:25,099
The arrows of mischievous smile...

1029
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:27,099
When they hit you, you clever one!

1030
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:30,139
You will be my prisoner then!

1031
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:31,969
A beautiful wife,

1032
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:34,059
Is like a honey bee sucking nectar!

1033
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:34,600
But...

1034
00:59:34,601 --> 00:59:35,679
Later...

1035
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:36,600
When you feel the intoxication...

1036
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:37,600
It slows down, it slows down!

1037
00:59:37,601 --> 00:59:39,389
Be cautious!

1038
00:59:39,390 --> 00:59:43,099
I'm a lightning like vine...

1039
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:46,969
Eyes like the edge of a sword!

1040
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:50,639
In the trap, it's when you fall...

1041
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:53,770
Will you realize this plot!

1042
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,309
Rocky has come to the pub!

1043
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:05,520
What is Rocky doing there?

1044
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,270
The situation has gone beyond control!

1045
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:13,850
You have to come now!

1046
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:20,679
What is it that you are searching for?

1047
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:22,559
Look at my beauty...

1048
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:25,349
A woman more beautiful
than me, do you need?

1049
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:28,099
Before taking a step,

1050
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:29,889
Look at me once again...

1051
01:00:29,890 --> 01:00:32,769
Understand my signals, my darling!

1052
01:00:32,770 --> 01:00:35,269
What is it that you are searching for?

1053
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:37,139
Look at my beauty...

1054
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:39,929
A woman more beautiful
than me, do you need?

1055
01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:42,679
Before taking a step,

1056
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,469
Look at me once again...

1057
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:47,350
Understand my signals, my darling!

1058
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:48,390
Alert...

1059
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:49,520
Alert...

1060
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,349
The lamp is extinguished...
There is darkness!

1061
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:53,019
In the trap of the vine...

1062
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:55,099
Lets escape and run...
Slowly... Slowly!

1063
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:57,099
Be cautious!

1064
01:00:57,100 --> 01:01:00,809
I'm a lightning like vine...

1065
01:01:00,810 --> 01:01:04,679
Eyes like the edge of a sword!

1066
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:08,429
In the trap, it's when you fall...

1067
01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:11,560
Will you realize this plot!

1068
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:23,680
This guy...

1069
01:01:23,770 --> 01:01:25,219
You gave such a build-up for this guy?

1070
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:27,270
By him...
You guys even got beaten up!

1071
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:30,019
I don't know where you came from!

1072
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:31,059
After coming to Bangalore,

1073
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:32,519
where is Vidhana Soudha...

1074
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,850
How is the weather here,
before finding out about these...

1075
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:37,810
How bad I am, that you
should have found out!

1076
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:39,270
You made a mistake!

1077
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:42,560
And now it's too late!

1078
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:52,640
Don't waste a bullet!

1079
01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:55,060
He is not worth it!

1080
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:59,179
Do you know why I called all of them?

1081
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:00,600
Not to get you hit up!

1082
01:02:00,970 --> 01:02:03,220
To merely show you your worth!

1083
01:02:03,930 --> 01:02:05,099
To even aspire,

1084
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:06,720
you need to be worthy!

1085
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:08,310
That too a girl like me...

1086
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:11,520
Still I will give you an opportunity!

1087
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:13,930
To your manhood!

1088
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:17,850
In front of all of them,
if you come and touch me,

1089
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:20,100
I will be yours!

1090
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:39,560
Hey!

1091
01:02:39,561 --> 01:02:40,889
Go, go away man...

1092
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:42,219
Get the hell out!

1093
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:43,719
You need guts dude!

1094
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:44,970
Get going! Get going!

1095
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:46,769
Hey kid!

1096
01:02:46,770 --> 01:02:48,390
Go to Balepet and tell my name!

1097
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:51,000
Two dozen bangles will be given to you,
in my uncle's shop!

1098
01:03:02,350 --> 01:03:03,640
Do you have a match box!

1099
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:18,430
Petrol...

1100
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:04,060
Those who love are high on jealousy...
It is said so...

1101
01:04:05,810 --> 01:04:08,559
Everyone who puts his
finger on the trigger is not a shooter!

1102
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:11,019
Everyone who lays his hand
on a girl is not a man!

1103
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:13,309
What is my worth...

1104
01:04:13,310 --> 01:04:14,769
Other than those who love me,

1105
01:04:14,770 --> 01:04:16,290
it won't be understood by anyone else!

1106
01:04:22,770 --> 01:04:25,099
Hey... Where is that
Balepete Bangle seller?

1107
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:26,679
In my uncle's shops

1108
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:28,639
Without customers, the
business had become dull,

1109
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,270
That's why I was promoting it...

1110
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:31,520
Sorry brother!

1111
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:33,519
And then...

1112
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,180
Who is that who said I need guts?

1113
01:04:36,810 --> 01:04:38,019
I love you darling!

1114
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:39,520
You gave me a great idea!

1115
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,769
He who plans to visit a city,

1116
01:04:45,770 --> 01:04:47,720
finds out about it!

1117
01:04:48,270 --> 01:04:50,310
He who comes to rule the city!

1118
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:53,470
Informs the city about who he is!

1119
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:56,969
If you think you are bad...

1120
01:04:56,970 --> 01:04:58,929
I am your Dad!

1121
01:04:58,930 --> 01:05:00,100
You...
- Kamal!

1122
01:05:08,770 --> 01:05:10,720
My father-in-law come!

1123
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:14,770
Everybody out...

1124
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:22,849
You got saved man!

1125
01:05:22,850 --> 01:05:25,059
They came, not to save me, you dumbo...

1126
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:27,310
But to save you from me!

1127
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:31,970
Who is he??

1128
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,970
He is the one who has come to kill Garuda!

1129
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:38,350
This chap?

1130
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:39,809
Why were you called??

1131
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:40,969
And what are you doing??

1132
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:43,219
I don't want people who
put my words in their ears!

1133
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:44,929
I wanted those who will
put it in their minds!

1134
01:05:44,930 --> 01:05:47,429
That why I came to Rajendra Desai's Pub

1135
01:05:47,430 --> 01:05:50,390
and made Rajendra Desai to come!

1136
01:05:51,470 --> 01:05:52,969
What have you planned?

1137
01:05:52,970 --> 01:05:55,140
Garuda will come only in the second road!

1138
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:57,640
On the road where there are more people...

1139
01:05:58,470 --> 01:06:00,140
The newly opened shops,

1140
01:06:00,970 --> 01:06:02,770
The customers who move around there...

1141
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:05,719
In the houses nearby the people

1142
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:07,179
who have just taken places for rent...

1143
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:09,389
Since many days, the damaged vehicles
which have been parked there!

1144
01:06:09,390 --> 01:06:10,559
The empty taxis...

1145
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:12,639
Every single person out
there are his own men!

1146
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,219
We can't kill him there!

1147
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:14,930
Then??

1148
01:06:14,931 --> 01:06:17,720
I will kill him inside the
DYSS Party Office itself!

1149
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:19,390
What are you saying??

1150
01:06:19,391 --> 01:06:20,889
In that road there will be police...

1151
01:06:20,890 --> 01:06:22,410
Even in the gate there will be cops...

1152
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:24,600
Even Ministers will be checked there!

1153
01:06:26,270 --> 01:06:27,599
The young master is coming,

1154
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:28,970
Everybody has to be checked!

1155
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:32,599
You are planning to kill him inside??

1156
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:34,139
We too will be checked!

1157
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:35,640
He will also be checked...

1158
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:38,810
Inside... If in my hands, I get a gun!

1159
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:43,220
The gun...

1160
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:44,680
You will surely get!

1161
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:54,849
Having erected the
statue and laid the bait!

1162
01:06:54,850 --> 01:06:56,770
They were waiting for Garuda!

1163
01:09:43,270 --> 01:09:46,680
My father has believed all of you a lot!

1164
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:49,519
To maintain that, on his behalf...

1165
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:50,890
I have come all the way here!

1166
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:03,060
My father has built a huge kingdom itself!

1167
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:15,810
I will build a kingdom
much bigger than that!

1168
01:10:19,890 --> 01:10:22,639
The statue they had build
was Suryavardhan's...

1169
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,349
But what was installed there...

1170
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:25,640
Was Garuda's!

1171
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:01,680
Let's go... Let's go...

1172
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:05,270
He didn't kill him?

1173
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:08,140
Does that mean that your hero failed?

1174
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:09,770
He lost!

1175
01:11:10,930 --> 01:11:12,349
Now what will your hero do??

1176
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:13,470
Will he give up??

1177
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:16,520
The wounded lion's breath...

1178
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:19,390
Is far more terrifying than his roar!

1179
01:11:22,180 --> 01:11:23,270
What do you mean??

1180
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:24,770
Page 128...

1181
01:11:25,310 --> 01:11:28,140
Taking a lot of trouble,
I have written a poem...

1182
01:11:28,970 --> 01:11:30,100
Have you locked the gate,

1183
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:31,969
Have you called some security?

1184
01:11:31,970 --> 01:11:33,519
Don't allow anybody inside!

1185
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,929
He won't kill that easily!

1186
01:11:35,930 --> 01:11:38,640
He will shoot and hang him
in front of Vidhana Soudha!

1187
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:42,179
After a lot of thought,
to get one gun inside,

1188
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:43,100
If we struggled so much...

1189
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:43,930
To protect,

1190
01:11:43,931 --> 01:11:45,309
A whole army was inundated out there!

1191
01:11:45,310 --> 01:11:47,809
In those, half the people
who lifted their guns...

1192
01:11:47,810 --> 01:11:49,429
All these days, I thought
they were our men!

1193
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:50,639
Where is that guy from Bombay?

1194
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,020
He is inside!

1195
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:55,470
We thought if we kill him,

1196
01:11:57,140 --> 01:11:59,810
If we kill him when we thought that,
that place would become ours!

1197
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,929
The heaven that we live in,
We have converted it into a graveyard!

1198
01:12:02,930 --> 01:12:04,969
Under the impression that
we can rule some world!

1199
01:12:04,970 --> 01:12:06,390
The entire world!

1200
01:12:10,350 --> 01:12:11,350
But...

1201
01:12:12,270 --> 01:12:13,810
Why did he spare us?

1202
01:12:14,850 --> 01:12:16,060
Power...

1203
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:22,139
He can kill us whenever he pleases!

1204
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:25,969
But he had come to show the
world what his power was!

1205
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:29,059
Now he is waiting for his father to die!

1206
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:31,019
There is very little time!

1207
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:32,770
If Garuda does not die now,

1208
01:12:33,310 --> 01:12:35,270
we will all die for sure!

1209
01:12:36,850 --> 01:12:37,850
If so,

1210
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:40,560
will you go there?

1211
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:43,220
To that place?

1212
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:47,310
In their midst?

1213
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:51,770
Can someone dare to go to that hell?

1214
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:56,019
Can you even think of that??

1215
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:57,560
The blow that he has given us here,

1216
01:12:58,270 --> 01:13:00,810
No one will even think of going there!

1217
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:12,809
The burning igneous chest...

1218
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:14,220
Sweating in rampant fear!

1219
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:18,100
Boiling meteors scattered in the sky!

1220
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:22,639
The rest seems to have been burnt!

1221
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,269
In a fight,

1222
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:26,850
who hits first is not what is counted...

1223
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:34,430
Who falls down first is
what clinches the fight!

1224
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:41,139
The one you have called me to kill...

1225
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:43,720
Without killing him, I will not go back!

1226
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,719
Wherever the place is,

1227
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:48,769
However it is,

1228
01:13:48,770 --> 01:13:50,810
I will go right there and kill him!

1229
01:13:54,770 --> 01:13:57,970
The waves are waiting for
the earth to embrace...

1230
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:05,430
The sun waits with
patience to set in the sky!

1231
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:12,970
Thunder and lightning are
overriding the hillock!

1232
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:15,519
To it's own writing...

1233
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:16,520
Go man!

1234
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,680
Fate too shivers!

1235
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:37,359
Why all this for me, Mother?

1236
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:38,660
I don't believe in God.

1237
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:40,660
You believe me, don't you?

1238
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:51,490
Don't ever lose this.

1239
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:10,240
Hello...

1240
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:11,910
Get a map ready.

1241
01:15:21,070 --> 01:15:22,160
The map you asked for.

1242
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:24,819
Once you go there, our contact will be cut.

1243
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:27,659
The map in your hand contains
only half the information.

1244
01:15:27,660 --> 01:15:29,780
You will have to fill in
the rest once you get there.

1245
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:32,490
Once you get set there, give us a signal,

1246
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:34,660
a big one...

1247
01:15:34,910 --> 01:15:36,780
There is only one way to get there.

1248
01:15:38,610 --> 01:15:40,610
John has sent trucks to a town...

1249
01:15:40,990 --> 01:15:43,280
to catch people like fish in a net.

1250
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:45,740
You have to go and get
inside one of those trucks.

1251
01:15:45,820 --> 01:15:49,820
But before that there are trained killers
surrounding the entire town with barricades...

1252
01:15:49,950 --> 01:15:51,860
You have to cross them.

1253
01:15:58,950 --> 01:15:59,490
Sir...

1254
01:15:59,950 --> 01:16:01,739
Did you find out anything about Rocky?

1255
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:02,360
Hey!

1256
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:04,820
Hey... Kiddo!
Bring hot tea for Shetty Boss.

1257
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:06,280
Father,

1258
01:16:06,450 --> 01:16:09,070
where has Rocky gone?

1259
01:16:12,990 --> 01:16:14,989
Since 25 years...

1260
01:16:14,990 --> 01:16:17,109
I have been working for him!

1261
01:16:17,110 --> 01:16:19,779
I don't know about him all that well...

1262
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:22,529
Uncle... Will you say it or should I?

1263
01:16:22,530 --> 01:16:24,910
But theirs is a huge forest.

1264
01:16:27,490 --> 01:16:28,490
That guy,

1265
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:30,319
her lover.

1266
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,660
He will not return from
the place he has gone to...

1267
01:16:33,110 --> 01:16:34,110
Will you tell her that?

1268
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:36,360
Or should I?

1269
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:43,360
Here, among the sheep...
Rocky was like a Ram...

1270
01:16:45,990 --> 01:16:47,659
But in that forest,

1271
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:49,450
he is just an insect!

1272
01:16:55,450 --> 01:16:57,699
Don't worry about him, Uncle...

1273
01:16:57,700 --> 01:16:58,660
He's gone!

1274
01:16:58,661 --> 01:17:00,159
He will never return!

1275
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:01,449
Hey! No man...

1276
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:03,110
I'm not worried about Rocky...

1277
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:06,069
Day before yesterday, when he visited me,
he brought sweetmeats for the kids.

1278
01:17:06,070 --> 01:17:07,319
The kids loved it...

1279
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:09,200
Just wanted to know where
he bought that from!

1280
01:17:09,570 --> 01:17:11,200
Don't worry about him, man...

1281
01:17:11,490 --> 01:17:12,660
You know about him...

1282
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:14,490
Don't you sir?

1283
01:17:17,490 --> 01:17:19,010
Hey... Sit down,
sit down all of you...

1284
01:17:19,910 --> 01:17:21,350
Hey... Fill them up in the trucks...

1285
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:28,199
Someone is walking towards you...

1286
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:29,200
Towards us?

1287
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:31,240
Let him come...

1288
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:32,699
He will not be allowed to leave...

1289
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:33,859
He is not going out...

1290
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:35,109
He is barging his way in...

1291
01:17:35,110 --> 01:17:36,110
What??

1292
01:17:36,410 --> 01:17:39,030
Once he catches the track, it's fixed!

1293
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:43,530
Neither does he stop,
nor does he bow down...

1294
01:17:57,030 --> 01:17:58,490
He is blessed...

1295
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,700
Wonder who's son this adamant lad is...

1296
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:23,949
Rocky is like fire...

1297
01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:25,319
Enemy...

1298
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:26,320
Petrol...

1299
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:29,320
As the number of enemies increase...

1300
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:32,160
He burns brighter...

1301
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:57,199
You mentioned that he had
gone to some forest...

1302
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:59,030
Please do not go there...

1303
01:20:04,780 --> 01:20:06,320
I promise on God...

1304
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:11,160
The forest will catch fire...

1305
01:20:17,910 --> 01:20:19,279
Boss, the tea is cold...

1306
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:22,199
Hey kiddo...
Bring a hot cup of tea for sir...

1307
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:25,950
Today I have to give my kids Rasgulla...

1308
01:20:30,070 --> 01:20:31,070
Go inside...

1309
01:21:26,570 --> 01:21:27,570
Hey... What happened...

1310
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:28,700
Who's it??

1311
01:21:30,570 --> 01:21:31,570
One guy...

1312
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:41,420
They must have died fighting each other...

1313
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:58,990
First send the trucks...

1314
01:21:59,570 --> 01:22:01,030
They are waiting...

1315
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:04,780
He has left...

1316
01:22:09,860 --> 01:22:12,160
He did not know about
the road he had taken...

1317
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:19,530
He had no knowledge of his destination...

1318
01:22:25,450 --> 01:22:28,280
Nor did he know about
the monstrous history...

1319
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:32,910
Suryavardhan had grown to heights
where none could touch him

1320
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:35,200
but a day after his fall...

1321
01:22:37,110 --> 01:22:39,700
The shouts of his heirs echoed.

1322
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:41,820
You have built this kingdom
with a lot of effort...

1323
01:22:41,910 --> 01:22:43,239
He had to select someone...

1324
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:45,030
Tell... Who should rule after you...??

1325
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:46,240
Your son Garuda...

1326
01:22:46,570 --> 01:22:47,450
Or brother Adheera...

1327
01:22:47,451 --> 01:22:48,950
Adheera...

1328
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:56,950
Brother!

1329
01:22:57,320 --> 01:23:02,610
Here politics and deceit was
stronger than a million swords...

1330
01:23:03,530 --> 01:23:06,110
You do not know either...

1331
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:09,659
Like how,
without a desire for KGF,

1332
01:23:09,660 --> 01:23:11,490
you were standing behind me...

1333
01:23:11,950 --> 01:23:14,200
Like that you should
stand next to Garuda...

1334
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:16,280
Hey...

1335
01:23:17,990 --> 01:23:20,199
Once brother commands...
No more discussions!

1336
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:23,530
Till Garuda is around...
I will not desire this position...

1337
01:23:25,660 --> 01:23:26,860
That single decision,

1338
01:23:27,570 --> 01:23:30,320
shook the very foundation of
the fortress built by him...

1339
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:35,360
Adheera attacked Garuda...

1340
01:23:37,070 --> 01:23:38,070
He missed his target...

1341
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:42,200
Garuda attacked Adheera...

1342
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:46,240
He did not miss his mark...

1343
01:23:52,030 --> 01:23:54,200
Garuda took over the reign

1344
01:23:54,610 --> 01:23:56,990
and began to rule the entire KGF...

1345
01:24:00,990 --> 01:24:05,450
but he was well aware that
there were many people who desired KGF...

1346
01:24:05,660 --> 01:24:07,819
Although he knew he had
enemies next to him...

1347
01:24:07,820 --> 01:24:13,280
He took an oath to wait till his father
was alive and then destroy his enemies...

1348
01:25:27,610 --> 01:25:30,070
To protect his empire,
Suryavardhan

1349
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:33,609
had selected three forms of security.

1350
01:25:33,610 --> 01:25:35,320
One was a huge wall...

1351
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:41,110
A huge door...

1352
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:52,160
And to protect these two,
a ruthless Commander-in-Chief!

1353
01:25:54,410 --> 01:25:55,410
Vaanaram...

1354
01:26:04,110 --> 01:26:05,159
201 men,

1355
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,199
15 women...

1356
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:07,819
total 216 people...

1357
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:08,820
Yes...

1358
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:10,280
This years...

1359
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:13,160
It is the 41st batch!

1360
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:16,030
Put them to work...

1361
01:26:19,990 --> 01:26:22,660
After spilling a lot of blood
Suryavardhan had built this fort,

1362
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:24,320
he had only one worry!

1363
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:30,410
That no one should enter this place
and spill a drop of his blood...

1364
01:26:33,990 --> 01:26:37,160
Suryavardhan called this place Naraachi...

1365
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:38,909
Naraachi means

1366
01:26:38,910 --> 01:26:40,510
the Goldsmith's weighing scale on which,

1367
01:26:40,990 --> 01:26:43,280
he placed intelligence on one side

1368
01:26:43,570 --> 01:26:47,410
and fear on the other and equalized it!

1369
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:17,279
The new dogs have arrived.

1370
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:18,530
Take them...

1371
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:32,779
Brother... When will
they send us from here?

1372
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:35,780
Since 20 years...
I have been asking the same question!

1373
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:47,660
He has come...

1374
01:27:47,661 --> 01:27:49,359
He has come...
I told you... I told you...

1375
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:51,319
He would rescue us all. - You say the same
thing about everyone who comes here...

1376
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:53,280
He... He... Will save us.
- Get going... Get going

1377
01:27:58,570 --> 01:28:00,069
Who hit him??

1378
01:28:00,070 --> 01:28:01,110
I did brother...

1379
01:28:05,700 --> 01:28:08,280
Apply tincher on his wounds
and give him some food...

1380
01:28:10,490 --> 01:28:12,569
He murders on the one hand

1381
01:28:12,570 --> 01:28:14,159
and on the other shows compassion...

1382
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:15,739
I'm unable to understand my brother.

1383
01:28:15,740 --> 01:28:16,700
Compassion??

1384
01:28:16,701 --> 01:28:18,859
You have just returned from London.

1385
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:20,860
You will understand more as time goes by...

1386
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:23,176
He said that these three people
have to be well taken care of,

1387
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:24,600
they who had come to kill Garuda...

1388
01:28:24,860 --> 01:28:26,490
Do you know why he has kept them alive?

1389
01:28:27,030 --> 01:28:28,699
This time for the
procession of the Goddess,

1390
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:30,160
Rams have not been brought...

1391
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:31,360
So?

1392
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:46,110
You have all recently come here

1393
01:29:46,660 --> 01:29:49,450
but there is no time for
anyone to wipe their tears...

1394
01:29:49,700 --> 01:29:51,660
You've learnt how to bow your heads down...

1395
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:53,529
There is still a lot to learn...

1396
01:29:53,530 --> 01:29:55,200
You arrived yesterday?

1397
01:29:55,450 --> 01:29:57,110
You arrived yesterday?

1398
01:29:57,240 --> 01:29:58,860
Which movie was released?

1399
01:29:59,030 --> 01:30:00,910
Which movie was released?

1400
01:30:01,070 --> 01:30:02,360
Don't you know?

1401
01:30:02,610 --> 01:30:03,739
Don't you know?

1402
01:30:03,740 --> 01:30:04,780
Go away!

1403
01:30:05,030 --> 01:30:06,160
Go away!

1404
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:16,200
We have been brought here

1405
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:21,360
for mining...

1406
01:30:47,780 --> 01:30:50,660
Everyday we have to work
in a 12 hour shift...

1407
01:30:51,700 --> 01:30:54,110
No one should raise their
heads and look at the guards...

1408
01:30:57,110 --> 01:30:58,670
They do not tolerate being looked at...

1409
01:31:00,610 --> 01:31:01,740
They will shoot you...

1410
01:31:27,860 --> 01:31:30,450
You will work 900 feet below ground...

1411
01:31:37,610 --> 01:31:39,910
You will be a little
scared on the first day...

1412
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:53,990
Forget the outside world...

1413
01:32:08,070 --> 01:32:09,070
Come outside...

1414
01:32:09,740 --> 01:32:10,740
Come...

1415
01:32:13,990 --> 01:32:15,110
Blasting....

1416
01:32:27,660 --> 01:32:30,070
It's done, come for work!

1417
01:32:37,700 --> 01:32:40,199
Instead of working...

1418
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:41,950
Hey... Hey... He's a newcomer...

1419
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:42,820
A newcomer...

1420
01:32:43,030 --> 01:32:43,740
I will tell him...

1421
01:32:43,910 --> 01:32:44,990
Work, work!

1422
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:52,820
Do you want to die on the
first day of your job?

1423
01:32:53,410 --> 01:32:54,610
What were you doing?

1424
01:32:55,030 --> 01:32:56,660
What were you doing outside?

1425
01:32:58,860 --> 01:32:59,860
Construction work!

1426
01:33:00,660 --> 01:33:02,910
The wounds on the upper part
of your palms tell me...

1427
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:04,880
About the work you were doing outside...

1428
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:12,070
The sooner you learn the ways
and methods of this place,

1429
01:33:13,070 --> 01:33:14,350
the better it will be for you...

1430
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:23,610
Sorry...

1431
01:33:37,190 --> 01:33:39,076
In the trucks that reached
here day before yesterday,

1432
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:40,979
Before Batch number 49 reaches here...

1433
01:33:40,980 --> 01:33:42,420
An incident happened in John's gang!

1434
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,040
Ramana told me about it...

1435
01:33:44,170 --> 01:33:44,840
What happened?

1436
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,760
Our boys always squabbled
with each other...

1437
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,560
But don't know what happened this time,

1438
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:50,460
they have fought and killed each other!

1439
01:33:50,670 --> 01:33:52,249
Is no one alive amongst them?

1440
01:33:52,250 --> 01:33:53,960
Only one was alive when I came...

1441
01:33:54,290 --> 01:33:55,709
Did he say anything?

1442
01:33:55,710 --> 01:33:57,316
While breathing his last,
he said, 'One man...'

1443
01:33:57,340 --> 01:33:58,540
I did not understand anything!

1444
01:33:58,840 --> 01:33:59,880
One man?

1445
01:34:01,460 --> 01:34:02,460
Vanaram sir...

1446
01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:03,750
Sir!

1447
01:34:04,630 --> 01:34:05,750
One man!

1448
01:34:29,170 --> 01:34:31,040
We are playing a game of chess

1449
01:34:32,630 --> 01:34:34,670
But we seem to be playing with just a pawn!

1450
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:37,630
We have guards at the gate...

1451
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:42,290
We have guards at the Mining...

1452
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:47,000
We have guards at the watch tower...

1453
01:34:50,130 --> 01:34:51,420
We have guards on the walls too!

1454
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:55,290
Garuda's guards!

1455
01:34:59,540 --> 01:35:00,919
You don't worry!

1456
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:03,000
We all have ample security!

1457
01:35:03,290 --> 01:35:06,249
Even if the security was very tight,
Rocky has to cross Biligiri

1458
01:35:06,250 --> 01:35:09,129
and enter the house through
a tunnel near one of the watch towers

1459
01:35:09,130 --> 01:35:10,340
And kill Garuda...

1460
01:35:10,710 --> 01:35:12,920
We have only given Rocky
the blueprints of the house

1461
01:35:13,090 --> 01:35:16,750
But he has to find out under
which Watch tower the tunnel is!

1462
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:19,000
How will he find it?

1463
01:35:19,540 --> 01:35:20,590
Maintenance room...

1464
01:35:23,710 --> 01:35:26,290
All the information in Narachi
will be got right there!

1465
01:35:27,210 --> 01:35:29,459
No one is permitted without scrutiny!

1466
01:35:29,460 --> 01:35:29,920
Hey...

1467
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:30,920
Stand right there!

1468
01:35:32,790 --> 01:35:34,710
But the highest security is at that place!

1469
01:35:36,540 --> 01:35:37,540
Then how?

1470
01:35:40,630 --> 01:35:42,999
In a sea of blood there
will be more bloodshed...

1471
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,339
The blood of Ram's will flow...

1472
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:47,039
People are saying that this time they will
sacrifice three men instead of Rams!

1473
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:48,879
When electricity goes off here!

1474
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:52,090
The guards coming rushing in...
From everywhere!

1475
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:54,169
I don't know how...

1476
01:35:54,170 --> 01:35:55,839
Even though all the guards
have Walkies with them,

1477
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:58,090
at times they will be suffering
due to lack of signal!

1478
01:35:59,590 --> 01:36:02,250
Crossing many Mines
Rocky had reached Narachi

1479
01:36:02,790 --> 01:36:05,210
and was trying to learn about it!

1480
01:36:08,750 --> 01:36:11,040
If 20,000 workers

1481
01:36:11,290 --> 01:36:14,130
were to be monitered by 400 guards,

1482
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:18,880
the rules governing them had to be extreme!

1483
01:36:23,460 --> 01:36:25,880
Due to what happened that day,
Rocky...

1484
01:36:26,590 --> 01:36:28,790
became one among the people there!

1485
01:36:47,210 --> 01:36:48,630
Shankra...

1486
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,919
Leave my place...

1487
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:51,129
I will hold it...
Leave that to me...

1488
01:37:51,130 --> 01:37:53,750
Leave it!
This is my place...

1489
01:38:04,790 --> 01:38:08,130
The day after they find
out that he is blind,

1490
01:38:08,590 --> 01:38:10,670
he will have to be buried!

1491
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,749
Hey... Put the mud...

1492
01:38:15,750 --> 01:38:17,589
Put it... Put it,

1493
01:38:17,590 --> 01:38:20,340
Put it guys... Put it!

1494
01:38:21,460 --> 01:38:24,630
If they realise that you are
unfit to work, that's it!

1495
01:38:30,750 --> 01:38:32,130
Rugga will enter!

1496
01:38:56,210 --> 01:38:58,170
He could not even shoot
the guy next to him!

1497
01:39:21,790 --> 01:39:24,670
People put animals in cages,

1498
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:28,879
but here animals have
put people in cages...

1499
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:31,380
Here there is neither heaven nor hell...

1500
01:39:31,590 --> 01:39:33,590
Nor is there good or bad...

1501
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:35,500
No beliefs at all!

1502
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:40,790
But Rugga was just a
small replica of Garuda!

1503
01:39:41,710 --> 01:39:43,839
Don't get sucked in by emotions!

1504
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:45,380
There is no value for them here!

1505
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,380
That will not affect the stone-hearted!

1506
01:39:51,750 --> 01:39:53,870
I am just understanding the
ways of the world here...

1507
01:39:54,210 --> 01:39:57,000
Only two people were
standing firm in Narachi...

1508
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,539
Those scoundrels will never be sensible,

1509
01:40:02,540 --> 01:40:04,959
They have klilled the mother and son,
just because they crossed Biligere!

1510
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:07,340
Don't give any of them food today!

1511
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:09,500
The rest of the people lives

1512
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:11,240
seemed to be have been uprooted!

1513
01:40:11,590 --> 01:40:12,130
Hey...

1514
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:13,500
Call Kencha....

1515
01:40:14,130 --> 01:40:15,130
let him tell a story,

1516
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,840
the children will stop
crying out of hunger!

1517
01:40:18,340 --> 01:40:20,500
But in a place where beliefs were dead,

1518
01:40:21,420 --> 01:40:22,460
a mad man...

1519
01:40:23,540 --> 01:40:25,590
was narrating stories
that he had created...

1520
01:40:25,880 --> 01:40:28,459
Hey... You always repeat the same thing!

1521
01:40:28,460 --> 01:40:30,089
Tell us some story!

1522
01:40:30,090 --> 01:40:31,879
You have seen so many movies,

1523
01:40:31,880 --> 01:40:33,460
daily you tell us a different story...

1524
01:40:34,290 --> 01:40:36,590
Tell us a story!

1525
01:40:39,540 --> 01:40:41,260
I will tell you the story of that forest...

1526
01:40:42,170 --> 01:40:44,249
I will tell you the story of that hero!

1527
01:40:44,250 --> 01:40:45,880
The story of the hero!

1528
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:49,539
In the direction of Modana under the hill

1529
01:40:49,540 --> 01:40:51,420
was a beautiful forest...

1530
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:54,039
Soft hearted tribals lived

1531
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:56,379
in the midst of lush Sandlewood!!

1532
01:40:56,380 --> 01:40:58,340
Hope you have a beautiful bonny boy baby!

1533
01:40:58,630 --> 01:40:59,250
Hey granny...

1534
01:40:59,250 --> 01:41:00,210
Why a baby boy?

1535
01:41:00,210 --> 01:41:01,210
I want a baby girl only!

1536
01:41:01,210 --> 01:41:02,170
Bless me again!

1537
01:41:02,171 --> 01:41:03,771
Fine... Fine...
May you have a girl baby!

1538
01:41:04,130 --> 01:41:06,590
A rain of fire fell in the forest!

1539
01:41:09,750 --> 01:41:12,000
The blaze of thunder...
Wherever you see!

1540
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,039
Which shift have they given you?

1541
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:16,040
Night shift!

1542
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:18,089
They have given me the morning shift!

1543
01:41:18,090 --> 01:41:19,169
Wait, I will ask them and come!

1544
01:41:19,170 --> 01:41:20,130
No, don't go!

1545
01:41:20,131 --> 01:41:21,499
Don't know what they will do...

1546
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:22,840
You please don't go!

1547
01:41:24,540 --> 01:41:26,090
Who will look after you now?

1548
01:41:27,460 --> 01:41:29,959
Lush forests have become wastelands!

1549
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:31,250
May you have a boy baby, dear...

1550
01:41:31,540 --> 01:41:32,250
Why?

1551
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:33,790
Has no one told you?

1552
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,290
How it is in this place?

1553
01:41:35,540 --> 01:41:37,209
If a girl baby is born here...

1554
01:41:37,210 --> 01:41:38,960
We ourselves kill it!

1555
01:41:42,380 --> 01:41:43,380
Oh! God!

1556
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:45,040
Let me have a baby boy please!

1557
01:41:46,380 --> 01:41:47,920
Let me have a baby boy please!

1558
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:51,630
It became a graveyard of innocent lives!

1559
01:41:54,750 --> 01:41:56,920
Why have you kept all the ration there?

1560
01:41:58,670 --> 01:41:59,880
See what will happen now!

1561
01:42:00,710 --> 01:42:01,340
Hey...

1562
01:42:01,710 --> 01:42:02,840
Take away the rations!

1563
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:09,460
The wretched demons who suck
the hot blood of poor people...

1564
01:42:10,460 --> 01:42:13,960
Cruel devils who cut the body
and devour the flesh!

1565
01:42:19,290 --> 01:42:20,879
The breath too has sucked

1566
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:22,790
the lives of the poor souls...

1567
01:42:23,670 --> 01:42:25,999
With self-respect I carried the body

1568
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,880
and reached the graveyard!

1569
01:42:28,090 --> 01:42:30,630
The sagging gait and the bent head!

1570
01:42:30,920 --> 01:42:32,720
A fistfull of curses in
destiny's writings...

1571
01:42:33,290 --> 01:42:37,710
Made them lose faith in the creator!

1572
01:42:38,710 --> 01:42:41,590
Made them lose their very faith!

1573
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,250
But...

1574
01:42:59,590 --> 01:43:01,670
Cutting the creator's chains...

1575
01:43:02,130 --> 01:43:03,999
Broadening the chest with pride

1576
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,589
As the Lord who nips the
lives of the raging demons!

1577
01:43:06,590 --> 01:43:08,686
The belief of those who were
oppressed and deppressed!

1578
01:43:08,710 --> 01:43:11,250
Was borne by a great mother!

1579
01:43:12,790 --> 01:43:15,879
In the womb, as you contain me...

1580
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:18,590
In the town, as you walk...

1581
01:43:18,630 --> 01:43:23,750
Seems like you are majestically
sitting in a chariot... Oh! Mother!

1582
01:43:24,710 --> 01:43:27,629
When I felt a ghost nearing me,

1583
01:43:27,630 --> 01:43:30,090
and was transfixed with fright

1584
01:43:30,590 --> 01:43:35,340
It was your saree veil that guards me...
Oh! Mother!

1585
01:43:36,710 --> 01:43:39,709
To the unseen God...

1586
01:43:39,710 --> 01:43:42,629
I refuse to pay obeisance
with folded hands...

1587
01:43:42,630 --> 01:43:47,500
To you, my life's breath itself
is the ritual of worship!

1588
01:43:54,840 --> 01:43:56,380
I can't take it anymore!

1589
01:44:02,460 --> 01:44:04,250
After you are born

1590
01:44:05,250 --> 01:44:06,880
you should become a strong man...

1591
01:44:07,380 --> 01:44:09,170
You should look after me...

1592
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:12,960
For those who are in trouble like me...

1593
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:17,750
You should look after those people...

1594
01:44:22,210 --> 01:44:23,840
Come fast my dear...

1595
01:44:25,090 --> 01:44:26,090
Come fast!

1596
01:44:26,540 --> 01:44:27,629
Scattered... Scared and sweating,

1597
01:44:27,630 --> 01:44:30,919
when the very moons were hiding
under the shield of the saree...

1598
01:44:30,920 --> 01:44:34,170
A fiery woman gave birth to a volcano then!

1599
01:44:46,630 --> 01:44:49,499
Like the rains that pour
incessently in the blazing rains!

1600
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:52,290
Like he who conquered death
in the house of death!

1601
01:44:52,670 --> 01:44:55,340
Like a rebellion in the face of riches!

1602
01:44:55,420 --> 01:44:57,840
Like a fatal bow facing a ten headed demon!

1603
01:44:57,920 --> 01:45:00,290
Beyond the inherent anger in him

1604
01:45:00,380 --> 01:45:03,090
Saying 'I am everything'
And questioning the very creator!

1605
01:45:03,250 --> 01:45:04,210
He who thundered

1606
01:45:04,211 --> 01:45:05,611
This is the story of one such hero!

1607
01:45:06,130 --> 01:45:08,670
The story of a brave-heart
who went beyond destiny!

1608
01:45:09,960 --> 01:45:10,960
Then...

1609
01:45:12,590 --> 01:45:13,590
What happened to him?

1610
01:45:19,960 --> 01:45:22,560
I will be alive till I have
to hold your hand and make you walk...

1611
01:45:28,250 --> 01:45:31,960
Then I will teach you to even leave my hand
and stand strong against others!

1612
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:40,960
Like the time that stood
still in front of death!

1613
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:45,670
Just kill him even if
he takes a small step!

1614
01:45:47,340 --> 01:45:50,290
Like the king who defeated death itself!

1615
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:54,289
Stamping the burning embers

1616
01:45:54,290 --> 01:45:56,170
and walking on swords that slit!

1617
01:45:56,960 --> 01:45:59,250
Killing the fear that raged in his heart!

1618
01:46:03,250 --> 01:46:05,670
Like a brave heart who punishes,
he walked on!

1619
01:46:13,630 --> 01:46:15,840
Hunting the hunters...

1620
01:46:17,380 --> 01:46:21,040
Came the warrior among hunters!

1621
01:46:22,380 --> 01:46:25,750
Arrest the impact of the thunderbolt...
Come... Oh! King!

1622
01:46:26,250 --> 01:46:29,630
The hapless life's breath you guard...
Oh! King!

1623
01:46:30,090 --> 01:46:32,999
Like an engulfed flame...
Spreading wild!

1624
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:34,170
You arrive!

1625
01:46:34,380 --> 01:46:37,339
Hey...

1626
01:46:37,340 --> 01:46:40,710
Arrest the impact of the thunderbolt...
Come... Oh! King!

1627
01:46:41,210 --> 01:46:44,590
The hapless life's breath you guard...
Oh! King!

1628
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:47,959
Like an engulfed flame...
Spreading wild!

1629
01:46:47,960 --> 01:46:50,040
You arrive!

1630
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,789
Are you a gutsy warrior?

1631
01:47:01,790 --> 01:47:03,709
Are you a brave-heart?

1632
01:47:03,710 --> 01:47:07,090
Or are you a demon?

1633
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:09,289
Are you a gutsy warrior?

1634
01:47:09,290 --> 01:47:11,209
Are you a brave-heart?

1635
01:47:11,210 --> 01:47:14,590
Or are you a demon?

1636
01:47:15,710 --> 01:47:18,290
What a class act!
I was sure that he will definitely come!

1637
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:28,459
The Brave-heart that I have desired!

1638
01:47:28,460 --> 01:47:32,289
In adulation I wait...

1639
01:47:32,290 --> 01:47:35,789
The silence is haunting me...

1640
01:47:35,790 --> 01:47:37,790
This very moment!

1641
01:47:38,340 --> 01:47:42,880
This king who I am smitten by!

1642
01:47:43,540 --> 01:47:46,999
I sit deep in his thoughts...

1643
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:50,629
Wherever I am,

1644
01:47:50,630 --> 01:47:53,040
I will remember you!

1645
01:48:22,630 --> 01:48:26,130
The perspiration of fear, you wipe it...
Come... Oh! King!

1646
01:48:26,420 --> 01:48:29,790
The deafening thunder you
caution and stand! Oh! King!

1647
01:48:30,170 --> 01:48:33,089
Like an engulfed flame...
Spreading wild!

1648
01:48:33,090 --> 01:48:35,170
You arrive!

1649
01:48:37,340 --> 01:48:40,840
The perspiration of fear, you wipe it...
Come... Oh! King!

1650
01:48:41,130 --> 01:48:44,500
The deafening thunder you
caution and stand! Oh! King!

1651
01:48:45,340 --> 01:48:48,249
Like an engulfed flame...
Spreading wild!

1652
01:48:48,250 --> 01:48:50,340
You arrive!

1653
01:48:52,290 --> 01:48:54,089
Are you a gutsy warrior?

1654
01:48:54,090 --> 01:48:55,999
Are you a brave-heart?

1655
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,380
Or are you a demon?

1656
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:01,629
Are you a gutsy warrior?

1657
01:49:01,630 --> 01:49:03,539
Are you a brave-heart?

1658
01:49:03,540 --> 01:49:06,920
Or are you a demon?

1659
01:49:07,340 --> 01:49:09,670
A respectful welcome!

1660
01:49:11,090 --> 01:49:13,420
A respectful welcome!

1661
01:49:14,840 --> 01:49:16,710
A respectful welcome!

1662
01:49:21,140 --> 01:49:22,680
You are really gutsy sir,

1663
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:24,656
without even anybody telling you,
you have come forward!

1664
01:49:24,680 --> 01:49:26,140
For this, why do you need guts man!

1665
01:49:26,510 --> 01:49:28,310
Your article itself will
not get published...

1666
01:49:28,510 --> 01:49:29,260
Why?

1667
01:49:29,261 --> 01:49:30,300
Will he allow that!

1668
01:49:32,640 --> 01:49:33,929
Without even being seen by anyone,

1669
01:49:33,930 --> 01:49:35,640
sitting somewhere and making deals

1670
01:49:36,350 --> 01:49:37,950
does that mean that he is such a coward?

1671
01:49:38,850 --> 01:49:40,009
Even if I get three kings,

1672
01:49:40,010 --> 01:49:43,100
the opponent must be having three aces
is how the world thinks,

1673
01:49:43,390 --> 01:49:46,010
but he never bothered about
the people in front of him!

1674
01:49:46,220 --> 01:49:48,050
He was the winner with a blind man's bluff!

1675
01:49:48,970 --> 01:49:51,009
I will tell you another incident, listen...

1676
01:49:51,010 --> 01:49:52,759
Once there was an attack in a pub,

1677
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:54,470
about twenty people with guns

1678
01:49:57,760 --> 01:49:58,799
Started firing...

1679
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:00,390
The entire pub got destroyed!

1680
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:04,850
Hey... Supplier...

1681
01:50:05,050 --> 01:50:06,429
What did you say it's name was?

1682
01:50:06,430 --> 01:50:08,100
M16 Automatic, sir...

1683
01:50:10,010 --> 01:50:12,139
So many people...
Why did they attack him sir?

1684
01:50:12,140 --> 01:50:12,720
Hey...

1685
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:13,760
That is wrong,

1686
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:14,800
don't write it like that!

1687
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:20,680
Sir... They will come sir!

1688
01:50:21,100 --> 01:50:23,719
The twenty people hadn't
come to attack him,

1689
01:50:23,720 --> 01:50:26,550
he had come to attack those twenty people!

1690
01:50:27,010 --> 01:50:29,929
To make sure that no one
escapes, he sat at the main door,

1691
01:50:29,930 --> 01:50:33,600
to check the guns the supplier brought,
directly he had come to the field,

1692
01:50:34,050 --> 01:50:35,050
Alone...

1693
01:50:35,510 --> 01:50:36,050
Hey...

1694
01:50:36,260 --> 01:50:38,350
We are so many here, each of us have a gun,

1695
01:50:38,390 --> 01:50:39,050
he has come alone,

1696
01:50:39,050 --> 01:50:40,050
why are you afraid?

1697
01:50:41,720 --> 01:50:43,000
Although so many of us are here,

1698
01:50:43,050 --> 01:50:44,680
Even if we have a gun...

1699
01:50:44,890 --> 01:50:45,970
he has come alone,

1700
01:50:46,220 --> 01:50:47,390
won't I get scared?

1701
01:50:49,720 --> 01:50:51,969
You must fear a little
at least in life sir...

1702
01:50:51,970 --> 01:50:53,140
Correct man...

1703
01:50:53,640 --> 01:50:55,759
In life there should be fear,

1704
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:57,680
the fear should be there in the heart

1705
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:01,299
But the heart that fears should not be ours

1706
01:51:01,300 --> 01:51:03,350
it must be that of our opponents!

1707
01:51:05,300 --> 01:51:06,800
May I come in?

1708
01:51:07,510 --> 01:51:09,300
Is he such a big gangster?

1709
01:51:10,050 --> 01:51:12,350
The one who comes with
a gang is a gangster!

1710
01:51:12,550 --> 01:51:13,850
He comes alone...

1711
01:51:18,550 --> 01:51:20,010
Monster!

1712
01:51:24,680 --> 01:51:25,680
Anand...

1713
01:51:30,180 --> 01:51:31,430
Again did I jump ahead...

1714
01:51:38,050 --> 01:51:39,100
In KGF,

1715
01:51:39,260 --> 01:51:41,890
about the internal scheming and brawls

1716
01:51:43,010 --> 01:51:44,680
Suryavardhan knew,

1717
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:48,140
In the coming days

1718
01:51:48,470 --> 01:51:50,009
bigger battles will come

1719
01:51:50,010 --> 01:51:52,760
to the doors of KGF
was also known by him!

1720
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:04,099
What Mr. Desai?

1721
01:52:04,100 --> 01:52:05,760
You have come this far?
To Delhi...

1722
01:52:06,350 --> 01:52:08,009
The sword which was getting
ready in the furnace

1723
01:52:08,010 --> 01:52:09,299
has now come on my neck!

1724
01:52:09,300 --> 01:52:10,300
That's why!

1725
01:52:15,260 --> 01:52:16,599
Was it all for this...

1726
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:17,760
Uncle went,

1727
01:52:18,640 --> 01:52:19,970
now even dad is going

1728
01:52:20,300 --> 01:52:22,760
Till you see our blood
spill, wont you stop??

1729
01:52:23,390 --> 01:52:25,639
I don't know for how many
days Boss will survive...

1730
01:52:25,640 --> 01:52:28,440
After he leaves, have you thought
about what will happen to all of us??

1731
01:52:28,550 --> 01:52:30,930
On my behalf, you all are busy thinking,

1732
01:52:31,850 --> 01:52:33,049
With a fish in your hand

1733
01:52:33,050 --> 01:52:34,970
you are trying to hunt a crocodile,

1734
01:52:35,350 --> 01:52:38,640
but for the crocodile your hand
looks tastier than the fish.

1735
01:52:39,140 --> 01:52:42,800
Just looking at hands full of blood
if you are getting so scared,

1736
01:52:42,850 --> 01:52:45,389
before a river of blood flows

1737
01:52:45,390 --> 01:52:47,050
you get out of here!

1738
01:52:49,100 --> 01:52:52,220
The vultures are hovering around Narachi!

1739
01:52:52,760 --> 01:52:55,599
Don't bother about the smaller waves...

1740
01:52:55,600 --> 01:52:57,889
We have more headaches to worry about!

1741
01:52:57,890 --> 01:52:59,890
After I depart,

1742
01:53:00,220 --> 01:53:02,510
bigger Tsunamis will approach!

1743
01:53:03,220 --> 01:53:05,010
Inayath Khaleel!

1744
01:53:07,470 --> 01:53:09,890
He is waiting since many years!

1745
01:53:10,010 --> 01:53:11,929
Once if he enters...

1746
01:53:11,930 --> 01:53:13,600
He will never leave!

1747
01:53:16,010 --> 01:53:18,550
This time's election,
do you know who is going to contest?

1748
01:53:19,930 --> 01:53:21,719
Ramika Sen

1749
01:53:21,720 --> 01:53:24,010
We all pay money to get a salute...

1750
01:53:24,180 --> 01:53:25,549
On hearing her name itself

1751
01:53:25,550 --> 01:53:27,719
people stand and salute her!

1752
01:53:27,720 --> 01:53:29,850
If she comes to power...

1753
01:53:32,640 --> 01:53:33,720
These two are enough...

1754
01:53:34,180 --> 01:53:35,760
To spoil this kingdom!

1755
01:53:36,930 --> 01:53:38,430
Think about them!

1756
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:47,010
How are you now?

1757
01:53:48,220 --> 01:53:50,850
Is he the guy who killed the girl child?

1758
01:54:18,680 --> 01:54:20,360
What happened to the matchbox I kept here?

1759
01:54:34,510 --> 01:54:35,760
Felt like someone pushed me...

1760
01:54:37,470 --> 01:54:39,470
Fire! Fire...

1761
01:54:41,050 --> 01:54:42,220
Hey...
Stop man!

1762
01:54:42,390 --> 01:54:43,510
There must be 105 people...

1763
01:54:43,640 --> 01:54:44,640
First take their count!

1764
01:54:46,680 --> 01:54:47,050
1,

1765
01:54:47,390 --> 01:54:47,760
2,

1766
01:54:48,180 --> 01:54:48,800
3,

1767
01:54:48,890 --> 01:54:49,470
4,

1768
01:54:49,600 --> 01:54:49,970
5,

1769
01:54:50,300 --> 01:54:50,680
6,

1770
01:54:51,010 --> 01:54:51,430
7,

1771
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:52,220
8,

1772
01:54:52,470 --> 01:54:52,850
9,

1773
01:54:53,180 --> 01:54:53,600
10,

1774
01:54:53,970 --> 01:54:54,350
11,

1775
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:55,050
12,

1776
01:54:55,350 --> 01:54:55,720
13,

1777
01:54:56,010 --> 01:54:56,510
14,

1778
01:54:56,890 --> 01:54:57,260
19,

1779
01:54:57,470 --> 01:54:58,050
16,

1780
01:54:58,180 --> 01:54:58,760
17,

1781
01:54:58,930 --> 01:54:59,510
18,

1782
01:54:59,680 --> 01:55:00,050
15,

1783
01:55:00,390 --> 01:55:00,760
20,

1784
01:55:01,100 --> 01:55:01,470
21,

1785
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:02,180
22,

1786
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:03,220
23,

1787
01:55:03,300 --> 01:55:03,890
24,

1788
01:55:04,010 --> 01:55:04,390
25,

1789
01:55:05,010 --> 01:55:05,550
26,

1790
01:55:05,680 --> 01:55:06,220
27,

1791
01:55:06,350 --> 01:55:06,970
28,

1792
01:55:06,970 --> 01:55:07,430
29,

1793
01:55:07,430 --> 01:55:08,430
30,

1794
01:55:08,510 --> 01:55:08,890
31,

1795
01:55:09,220 --> 01:55:09,600
32,

1796
01:55:10,010 --> 01:55:10,640
33,

1797
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:11,300
34,

1798
01:55:11,430 --> 01:55:11,800
35,

1799
01:55:12,100 --> 01:55:12,470
36,

1800
01:55:12,890 --> 01:55:13,890
37,

1801
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:52,260
91,

1802
01:55:52,260 --> 01:55:53,010
92,

1803
01:55:53,010 --> 01:55:53,720
93,

1804
01:55:53,720 --> 01:55:54,430
94,

1805
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:55,260
95,

1806
01:55:55,260 --> 01:55:55,970
96,
- Lorry,

1807
01:55:55,971 --> 01:55:57,549
97, 98
- Lorry!

1808
01:55:57,550 --> 01:55:58,390
99,

1809
01:55:58,390 --> 01:55:59,100
100,

1810
01:55:59,100 --> 01:55:59,800
101,

1811
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:00,600
102,

1812
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:01,260
103,

1813
01:56:01,260 --> 01:56:01,970
104,

1814
01:56:01,970 --> 01:56:02,640
105,

1815
01:56:02,970 --> 01:56:03,970
It is correct!

1816
01:56:20,300 --> 01:56:21,470
Today's food...

1817
01:56:23,010 --> 01:56:24,680
You have prepared it very well!

1818
01:56:38,180 --> 01:56:39,180
Take us too!

1819
01:56:39,800 --> 01:56:40,800
Where?

1820
01:56:40,970 --> 01:56:41,970
Outside...

1821
01:56:42,510 --> 01:56:43,510
I know!

1822
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:48,200
If you open your mouth, I will kill you!

1823
01:56:50,640 --> 01:56:51,640
I will fall at your feet!

1824
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:13,299
Someone's hand is behind the incident
that happened near the maintenance room!

1825
01:57:13,300 --> 01:57:14,260
It felt like someone...

1826
01:57:14,261 --> 01:57:15,821
Felt like someone hit me with a hammer!

1827
01:57:16,220 --> 01:57:17,929
Even though there is so much security,

1828
01:57:17,930 --> 01:57:19,049
someone has barged inside

1829
01:57:19,050 --> 01:57:20,300
and has seen the map,

1830
01:57:20,600 --> 01:57:22,429
the batch that came two day's earlier,

1831
01:57:22,430 --> 01:57:25,550
one of them has come to kill you, I feel!

1832
01:57:26,680 --> 01:57:28,139
To hit me??

1833
01:57:28,140 --> 01:57:29,140
Here??

1834
01:57:29,141 --> 01:57:32,509
Drinking the gruel you give over and again,

1835
01:57:32,510 --> 01:57:34,009
he would have gone to eat a bun

1836
01:57:34,010 --> 01:57:35,300
in the maintenance room!

1837
01:57:35,430 --> 01:57:37,260
We can't take the risk!

1838
01:57:38,100 --> 01:57:39,219
Then...

1839
01:57:39,220 --> 01:57:42,930
Call every single one
who worked In that zone!

1840
01:58:00,680 --> 01:58:01,760
Hello! Hello!

1841
01:58:02,050 --> 01:58:03,929
Junior Boss is coming near the hutments..

1842
01:58:03,930 --> 01:58:04,930
Over!

1843
01:58:20,720 --> 01:58:23,050
Who was it who entered
the maintenance room?

1844
01:58:23,550 --> 01:58:25,219
If you come by yourself...

1845
01:58:25,220 --> 01:58:26,850
Then only you will die...

1846
01:58:27,140 --> 01:58:28,469
Otherwise...

1847
01:58:28,470 --> 01:58:30,050
Everyone will die!

1848
01:58:31,510 --> 01:58:32,510
Gun...

1849
01:58:57,300 --> 01:58:59,260
If you know who he is, tell us...

1850
01:58:59,430 --> 01:59:00,680
Your life will be spared!

1851
01:59:44,140 --> 01:59:46,510
The one who doesn't even
know how to hold a sword,

1852
01:59:46,800 --> 01:59:48,470
will they call him to kill me?

1853
01:59:52,640 --> 01:59:55,299
The one who crossed the
maintenance room has been killed...

1854
01:59:55,300 --> 01:59:57,500
Now the Junior Boss is going
towards the Palace... Over!

1855
02:00:00,720 --> 02:00:02,099
Hello...
Your man has been caught,

1856
02:00:02,100 --> 02:00:03,179
They shot him!

1857
02:00:03,180 --> 02:00:04,180
What??

1858
02:00:05,850 --> 02:00:06,430
What happened?

1859
02:00:06,680 --> 02:00:07,800
They killed Rocky, it seems!

1860
02:00:09,970 --> 02:00:11,100
I told you that day itself,

1861
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:13,509
Calling that person from Bombay,
all of you...

1862
02:00:13,510 --> 02:00:15,830
Now who you will call and what will you do,
is left to you!

1863
02:00:45,930 --> 02:00:46,930
It's a baby girl!

1864
02:01:29,640 --> 02:01:31,100
For the sake of this child,

1865
02:01:31,350 --> 02:01:33,550
yesterday her father gave up his life!

1866
02:01:34,260 --> 02:01:35,350
Take us too with you!

1867
02:01:35,550 --> 02:01:38,179
Yesterday if he had not come forward,

1868
02:01:38,180 --> 02:01:41,100
With me, they would have
killed his pregnant wife!

1869
02:01:48,430 --> 02:01:50,509
But, now they will target him!

1870
02:01:50,510 --> 02:01:52,850
He... He...
He will protect us!

1871
02:01:53,550 --> 02:01:58,350
For the palace of a million dreams,

1872
02:01:59,010 --> 02:02:04,970
I will stand guard, as a soldier...
Oh! Mother!

1873
02:02:05,300 --> 02:02:10,260
To the plough that plows
the land carefully,

1874
02:02:10,850 --> 02:02:16,970
To provide a strong shoulder of support
for it, I will stand... Oh! Mother!

1875
02:02:17,510 --> 02:02:20,299
When a burning flame flows...

1876
02:02:20,300 --> 02:02:23,180
Burning the world,

1877
02:02:23,600 --> 02:02:28,140
The soothing rain I will become,
Listen... Oh! Mother!

1878
02:02:28,890 --> 02:02:30,600
At least once,

1879
02:02:30,970 --> 02:02:34,050
I am hoping that the story
he tells should become true!

1880
02:03:05,100 --> 02:03:06,180
Mama...

1881
02:03:19,970 --> 02:03:25,640
Mama...

1882
02:03:55,390 --> 02:03:56,390
Hey...

1883
02:03:57,220 --> 02:03:58,970
Let us finish the work and leave!

1884
02:04:04,110 --> 02:04:05,819
Walk on...
Keep walking...

1885
02:04:05,820 --> 02:04:07,399
Walk with your heads down!

1886
02:04:07,400 --> 02:04:09,530
Go faster guys!

1887
02:04:09,700 --> 02:04:11,530
Go faster! Go faster!

1888
02:04:25,200 --> 02:04:26,570
Guys... Run... Run... Run!

1889
02:04:43,990 --> 02:04:44,860
Boss!

1890
02:04:44,860 --> 02:04:45,820
What happened boss...

1891
02:04:45,821 --> 02:04:47,150
Remove your turban...

1892
02:04:48,990 --> 02:04:49,990
Brother...

1893
02:04:53,360 --> 02:04:54,610
Take off your turban, I say!!

1894
02:04:59,490 --> 02:05:02,069
If you bring the turban
and toss it in this basket

1895
02:05:02,070 --> 02:05:03,150
I will let you go!

1896
02:05:15,400 --> 02:05:16,400
Please don't...

1897
02:05:58,110 --> 02:06:00,109
Go... Go! Go away....
What are you standing and looking at?

1898
02:06:00,110 --> 02:06:01,199
Go... Go!

1899
02:06:01,200 --> 02:06:02,449
They knew he was blind,

1900
02:06:02,450 --> 02:06:04,070
but your hero didn't do anything...

1901
02:06:04,280 --> 02:06:05,569
Too much risk to take!

1902
02:06:05,570 --> 02:06:06,360
Sir!!

1903
02:06:06,361 --> 02:06:07,699
Why is he so quiet?

1904
02:06:07,700 --> 02:06:08,819
Why is he so silent?
Tell me sir?

1905
02:06:08,820 --> 02:06:09,989
Listen...
Now you are getting on my nerves!

1906
02:06:09,990 --> 02:06:11,069
One minute Madam...
One minute...

1907
02:06:11,070 --> 02:06:12,700
Sir, will he go back??

1908
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:15,610
Won't he do anything??

1909
02:06:19,490 --> 02:06:20,820
We can't do anything...

1910
02:06:22,200 --> 02:06:24,530
We can't rush and create history!

1911
02:06:25,200 --> 02:06:26,200
Go guys!

1912
02:06:26,280 --> 02:06:27,650
Go to hell!

1913
02:06:28,280 --> 02:06:29,030
Leave it...

1914
02:06:29,280 --> 02:06:30,399
What can be done??

1915
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:31,320
Hey... Leave...

1916
02:06:31,321 --> 02:06:33,489
Today I will kill him...

1917
02:06:33,490 --> 02:06:35,240
Be quite... Today I will kill him!

1918
02:06:35,650 --> 02:06:36,699
He has become old...

1919
02:06:36,700 --> 02:06:37,899
Wait man, wait!

1920
02:06:37,900 --> 02:06:39,699
How long will he live?

1921
02:06:39,700 --> 02:06:41,029
Let him die & live peacefully in heaven...

1922
02:06:41,030 --> 02:06:42,030
Hey...

1923
02:06:42,530 --> 02:06:44,780
Let him decide...
Leave him guy!

1924
02:06:45,030 --> 02:06:47,859
Whose plate he stamps

1925
02:06:47,860 --> 02:06:49,489
he must kill him!

1926
02:06:49,490 --> 02:06:51,400
Write your names on the plate...

1927
02:06:51,650 --> 02:06:52,819
Hey, write my name...

1928
02:06:52,820 --> 02:06:55,199
What's the point in standing and watching?

1929
02:06:55,200 --> 02:06:55,950
Let's move...

1930
02:06:56,110 --> 02:06:57,449
You don't bother listening to them...

1931
02:06:57,450 --> 02:06:58,110
Just leave!

1932
02:06:58,111 --> 02:07:00,740
Till now no one has touched them!

1933
02:07:01,240 --> 02:07:02,610
No one can even touch them...

1934
02:07:04,030 --> 02:07:06,470
Go, go... Alongwith the old man,
dig a grave for the baby too!

1935
02:07:08,530 --> 02:07:09,610
Don't cry baby...

1936
02:07:09,950 --> 02:07:10,950
Don't cry...

1937
02:07:12,820 --> 02:07:15,030
You can't rush and create history,

1938
02:07:16,450 --> 02:07:17,989
that does not mean

1939
02:07:17,990 --> 02:07:18,990
that you can plan history

1940
02:07:18,991 --> 02:07:20,360
and create a blueprint for it!

1941
02:07:30,490 --> 02:07:32,070
It just needs a spark!

1942
02:07:32,280 --> 02:07:33,780
Why did you stand up?

1943
02:07:34,110 --> 02:07:35,400
Keep that and leave...

1944
02:07:35,860 --> 02:07:36,860
That day,

1945
02:07:38,200 --> 02:07:39,900
The forest blazed furiously

1946
02:07:40,400 --> 02:07:44,400
Hidden in the depths of his being, The burning
embers he unleashed, the lion-hearted brave-heart!

1947
02:07:47,860 --> 02:07:51,740
Taunting every atom and every footprint, Unleashing
unbridled wrath, the magnificent warrior!

1948
02:07:52,400 --> 02:07:55,070
No More 'Shut up Rocky!'

1949
02:07:55,740 --> 02:08:01,450
Provoking the Warrior Dynasty, disturbing the very depths
of the ocean... Such a brave-heart, is this Emperor!

1950
02:08:03,200 --> 02:08:09,200
Provoking the Warrior Dynasty, disturbing the very depths
of the ocean... Such a brave-heart, is this Emperor!

1951
02:08:22,070 --> 02:08:23,700
Have you seen anyone jump so high?

1952
02:08:58,610 --> 02:09:01,989
He came...

1953
02:09:01,990 --> 02:09:03,649
A gutsy warrior, gutsy warrior...

1954
02:09:03,650 --> 02:09:05,489
This emperor is a gutsy warrior!!

1955
02:09:05,490 --> 02:09:07,609
A gutsy warrior, gutsy warrior...

1956
02:09:07,610 --> 02:09:09,449
This emperor is a gutsy warrior!!

1957
02:09:09,450 --> 02:09:11,569
A gutsy warrior, gutsy warrior...

1958
02:09:11,570 --> 02:09:13,399
This emperor is a gutsy warrior!!

1959
02:09:13,400 --> 02:09:15,529
A gutsy warrior, gutsy warrior...

1960
02:09:15,530 --> 02:09:17,070
This emperor is a gutsy warrior!!

1961
02:09:24,570 --> 02:09:25,570
Walk on...

1962
02:09:26,360 --> 02:09:27,700
No! He missed my plate!

1963
02:09:28,700 --> 02:09:29,700
Mine too he missed!

1964
02:09:30,990 --> 02:09:32,030
He missed it!

1965
02:09:37,860 --> 02:09:41,700
Everytime he gets the chance!

1966
02:09:42,570 --> 02:09:44,989
Hide & seek...

1967
02:09:44,990 --> 02:09:46,949
Forest & nest,

1968
02:09:46,950 --> 02:09:48,860
The bag of grains

1969
02:09:49,200 --> 02:09:51,359
It rolled & fell,

1970
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:53,449
My bird flew away,

1971
02:09:53,450 --> 02:09:55,569
I left it to fly!

1972
02:09:55,570 --> 02:09:57,859
Your bird...

1973
02:09:57,860 --> 02:09:59,360
Catch it guys!

1974
02:10:01,610 --> 02:10:03,370
Hey... What happened
to the electricity man?

1975
02:10:04,950 --> 02:10:06,570
Go and see what happened guys...

1976
02:10:10,860 --> 02:10:12,490
Who removed the fuse?

1977
02:10:15,950 --> 02:10:18,570
It's Kencha... Run, run!

1978
02:10:23,200 --> 02:10:24,860
Hey... Who hit him?

1979
02:10:26,900 --> 02:10:28,110
Where is Naga?

1980
02:10:31,610 --> 02:10:32,820
Who killed Muththa?

1981
02:10:35,740 --> 02:10:37,100
They both are not to be seen guys!

1982
02:11:00,400 --> 02:11:01,700
Kill him guys!

1983
02:12:46,820 --> 02:12:47,820
Is he here?

1984
02:12:48,570 --> 02:12:49,150
18,

1985
02:12:49,150 --> 02:12:49,950
19,

1986
02:12:49,950 --> 02:12:50,650
20,

1987
02:12:50,650 --> 02:12:51,610
21,

1988
02:12:51,610 --> 02:12:52,320
22,

1989
02:12:52,321 --> 02:12:53,740
including you it's 23!

1990
02:12:54,280 --> 02:12:55,990
Is the calculation correct man?

1991
02:13:25,320 --> 02:13:26,780
Have you beaten everybody?

1992
02:13:29,110 --> 02:13:30,780
I left one man...

1993
02:13:32,610 --> 02:13:34,450
For the procession!

1994
02:13:49,450 --> 02:13:53,109
Even in your final breath...
Do remember your promise!

1995
02:13:53,110 --> 02:13:57,109
Thorny paths are what you
will find in this world!

1996
02:13:57,110 --> 02:13:59,989
Even if the earth burns as a barrier,

1997
02:13:59,990 --> 02:14:02,700
Cross it and come...

1998
02:14:04,780 --> 02:14:06,859
Without giving up your persistence,

1999
02:14:06,860 --> 02:14:10,610
Stand firmly in front...

2000
02:14:18,070 --> 02:14:19,739
A gutsy warrior, gutsy warrior...

2001
02:14:19,740 --> 02:14:21,779
This emperor is a gutsy warrior!!

2002
02:14:21,780 --> 02:14:23,899
A gutsy warrior, gutsy warrior...

2003
02:14:23,900 --> 02:14:25,739
This emperor is a gutsy warrior!!

2004
02:14:25,740 --> 02:14:27,859
A gutsy warrior, gutsy warrior...

2005
02:14:27,860 --> 02:14:29,699
This emperor is a gutsy warrior!!

2006
02:14:29,700 --> 02:14:31,649
A gutsy warrior, gutsy warrior...

2007
02:14:31,650 --> 02:14:33,320
This emperor is a gutsy warrior!!

2008
02:14:36,280 --> 02:14:37,949
A gutsy warrior, gutsy warrior...

2009
02:14:37,950 --> 02:14:39,779
This emperor is a gutsy warrior!!

2010
02:14:39,780 --> 02:14:41,899
A gutsy warrior, gutsy warrior...

2011
02:14:41,900 --> 02:14:43,740
This emperor is a gutsy warrior!!

2012
02:15:08,570 --> 02:15:11,700
They are hitting so hard today!

2013
02:15:12,240 --> 02:15:14,610
Someone's luck must have run out!

2014
02:16:14,820 --> 02:16:15,150
He...

2015
02:16:15,151 --> 02:16:16,319
For the sake of the old man...

2016
02:16:16,320 --> 02:16:17,489
For the sake of the baby...

2017
02:16:17,490 --> 02:16:18,900
For their pain,

2018
02:16:19,400 --> 02:16:20,649
or for his own self...

2019
02:16:20,650 --> 02:16:22,110
Did he beat all of them...

2020
02:16:22,360 --> 02:16:23,360
But,

2021
02:16:23,450 --> 02:16:24,950
to all there,

2022
02:16:25,150 --> 02:16:27,490
at least for sometime they felt relief...

2023
02:16:29,990 --> 02:16:32,030
In all the cinemas,
there is one person right?

2024
02:16:32,280 --> 02:16:34,359
If I keep seeing you, I feel the same way!

2025
02:16:34,360 --> 02:16:35,030
Are you the hero?

2026
02:16:35,030 --> 02:16:35,780
No...

2027
02:16:35,990 --> 02:16:37,320
Villan!

2028
02:16:40,200 --> 02:16:41,400
Don't worry!!

2029
02:16:41,650 --> 02:16:42,740
We will bury him...

2030
02:16:43,110 --> 02:16:44,150
Burn it...

2031
02:16:44,450 --> 02:16:45,450
Why??

2032
02:16:47,610 --> 02:16:48,950
I am ready now!

2033
02:16:53,170 --> 02:16:55,000
Where is everyone?

2034
02:16:55,080 --> 02:16:57,250
Inform the office that no one can be seen!

2035
02:16:57,620 --> 02:16:59,539
By the time the village fair is over,

2036
02:16:59,540 --> 02:17:02,040
we want to run away somewhere...

2037
02:17:02,580 --> 02:17:05,169
You go to some other country...

2038
02:17:05,170 --> 02:17:06,749
By believing just one man!

2039
02:17:06,750 --> 02:17:08,210
We made a big mistake!

2040
02:17:18,040 --> 02:17:19,040
Rocky...

2041
02:17:19,330 --> 02:17:20,620
He is still alive...

2042
02:17:24,580 --> 02:17:26,210
He has sent a signal...

2043
02:17:26,370 --> 02:17:28,789
Once you are ready, send a big signal...

2044
02:17:28,790 --> 02:17:29,960
In a big way!

2045
02:17:30,250 --> 02:17:31,250
A big signal!

2046
02:17:42,370 --> 02:17:44,169
Near the huts, a big fire is burning,

2047
02:17:44,170 --> 02:17:46,170
The 23 guards in the Mine are missing...

2048
02:17:46,250 --> 02:17:48,079
Everyone go near the huts, right away!

2049
02:17:48,080 --> 02:17:51,539
The missing 23 guards must
have be killed by Rocky

2050
02:17:51,540 --> 02:17:54,289
and to make sure their bodies are
not found, he must have burned them!

2051
02:17:54,290 --> 02:17:55,959
That means, we must do something...

2052
02:17:55,960 --> 02:17:57,209
We must stop those jeeps...

2053
02:17:57,210 --> 02:17:59,669
or else to get to know
that Rocky is behind this,

2054
02:17:59,670 --> 02:18:01,619
they will not hesitate to
burn those 20,000 people!

2055
02:18:01,620 --> 02:18:03,169
We must stop those jeeps!

2056
02:18:03,170 --> 02:18:04,420
Something must be done!

2057
02:18:04,790 --> 02:18:05,790
Something must be done!

2058
02:18:08,620 --> 02:18:09,670
Father died...

2059
02:18:36,540 --> 02:18:37,749
The guards are coming here...

2060
02:18:37,750 --> 02:18:39,919
If they see us burning these 23 guards?

2061
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:40,830
What should we do then?

2062
02:18:40,831 --> 02:18:42,170
Hey...

2063
02:18:42,790 --> 02:18:45,370
The Big Boss has died!

2064
02:18:54,750 --> 02:18:56,210
The Big Boss has died!

2065
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:23,210
Father...

2066
02:19:23,710 --> 02:19:25,330
Boss...

2067
02:19:27,460 --> 02:19:29,040
The boss has died!

2068
02:19:31,870 --> 02:19:33,080
Lord Muruga...

2069
02:19:37,250 --> 02:19:38,999
Something is not falling
in the right place...

2070
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:40,670
You have a lot of enemies,

2071
02:19:40,750 --> 02:19:41,919
leave the rest for now,

2072
02:19:41,920 --> 02:19:44,360
it will be better if that fair
does not take place next week!

2073
02:19:44,460 --> 02:19:45,749
Priest...

2074
02:19:45,750 --> 02:19:46,370
Boss...

2075
02:19:46,371 --> 02:19:48,790
Tonight itself arrange for
the Goddesses blessings,

2076
02:19:49,040 --> 02:19:51,370
by dawn tomorrow

2077
02:19:52,580 --> 02:19:54,830
I should not have any enemies!

2078
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:59,500
On one side, Vaanaram has suspected
something and has tightened the security...

2079
02:20:05,330 --> 02:20:08,210
On the other side, Garuda's
brother Virat is waiting...

2080
02:20:08,670 --> 02:20:10,790
No one should be allowed
near the Junior Boss's room!

2081
02:20:11,170 --> 02:20:13,919
By dawn, crossing so much security,

2082
02:20:13,920 --> 02:20:15,459
even if he manages to kill Garuda...

2083
02:20:15,460 --> 02:20:17,000
How willl he escape from there?

2084
02:20:18,330 --> 02:20:19,960
I am setting the frequency of the Walky,

2085
02:20:20,330 --> 02:20:21,920
We have to inform something...

2086
02:20:22,540 --> 02:20:23,540
Something!

2087
02:20:23,830 --> 02:20:24,830
Let's go...

2088
02:20:26,500 --> 02:20:28,380
If he does not kill him,
what will his fate be,

2089
02:20:28,710 --> 02:20:30,170
what will the fate of the people be?

2090
02:20:32,670 --> 02:20:33,910
You had called for me urgently,

2091
02:20:34,170 --> 02:20:34,750
What's that??

2092
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:36,396
Which you can't say over the phone?

2093
02:20:36,420 --> 02:20:37,420
Father...

2094
02:20:37,920 --> 02:20:38,920
Will you tell him?

2095
02:20:40,870 --> 02:20:41,870
Or should I tell him??

2096
02:20:44,250 --> 02:20:46,370
Whatever be the place,

2097
02:20:46,620 --> 02:20:48,500
whoever be the people there...

2098
02:20:49,120 --> 02:20:51,540
The guy who went, he is my lover...

2099
02:20:53,290 --> 02:20:54,620
Will you say

2100
02:20:56,170 --> 02:20:57,500
or should I say it!

2101
02:21:01,080 --> 02:21:02,420
I am getting scared!

2102
02:21:02,830 --> 02:21:05,670
Other than getting
scared, what have we done?

2103
02:21:07,580 --> 02:21:09,579
From the time these walls have been built,

2104
02:21:09,580 --> 02:21:10,750
I am right here!

2105
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:12,789
We are living like slaves!

2106
02:21:12,790 --> 02:21:14,960
We will die like slaves, is what I thought!

2107
02:21:16,290 --> 02:21:18,670
But now I have got courage,

2108
02:21:19,460 --> 02:21:20,790
I have got belief!

2109
02:21:21,370 --> 02:21:23,539
Hey.. Hang it on the nail...
- Make way...

2110
02:21:23,540 --> 02:21:25,180
Hang it...
- Fine... Come... Come... Come!

2111
02:21:29,170 --> 02:21:30,210
Who is he,

2112
02:21:30,460 --> 02:21:33,170
why has he come here, I was wondering!

2113
02:21:36,870 --> 02:21:38,170
Now I understood...

2114
02:21:38,870 --> 02:21:42,330
He has come to change fiction into fact!

2115
02:22:02,920 --> 02:22:03,870
There has been a short circuit!

2116
02:22:03,871 --> 02:22:05,991
In the whole town of Narachi,
the power has been cut!

2117
02:22:07,870 --> 02:22:09,630
Near Biligere too, the
guards are stationed!

2118
02:22:09,920 --> 02:22:11,250
Run towards the Boss's room!

2119
02:22:17,620 --> 02:22:19,860
In front of Junior Boss's room,
the guards are stationed!

2120
02:22:20,870 --> 02:22:23,039
We are escorting him from
here to the Goddesses Fair!

2121
02:22:23,040 --> 02:22:24,040
Over!

2122
02:22:25,580 --> 02:22:26,580
Where has he gone?

2123
02:22:26,750 --> 02:22:27,750
Has he run away?

2124
02:22:27,870 --> 02:22:28,370
Has he run away?

2125
02:22:28,371 --> 02:22:30,999
There, in the village fair,
the walky signal will get cut!

2126
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:32,000
Lots of people there,

2127
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:32,870
be alert...

2128
02:22:32,871 --> 02:22:35,119
No one should even go
near the Junior Boss...

2129
02:22:35,120 --> 02:22:36,120
Leave...

2130
02:22:36,580 --> 02:22:37,120
Tell me sir...

2131
02:22:37,500 --> 02:22:38,870
If Rocky does not kill Garuda...

2132
02:22:39,540 --> 02:22:41,080
What will the fate of the people be?

2133
02:22:42,870 --> 02:22:43,870
She is there, right?

2134
02:22:44,960 --> 02:22:45,960
Our mother...

2135
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:49,000
Goddess Mariamma!

2136
02:22:59,120 --> 02:23:00,459
In the Goddesses fair!

2137
02:23:00,460 --> 02:23:01,499
In the fair...

2138
02:23:01,500 --> 02:23:03,420
In the fair he will kill him!

2139
02:23:13,870 --> 02:23:15,390
The short circuit is near Billigere...

2140
02:23:21,580 --> 02:23:23,169
Because someone rolled
the copper wire to a stone

2141
02:23:23,170 --> 02:23:24,869
and threw it on the electrical cable,

2142
02:23:24,870 --> 02:23:27,470
the short circuit has cut the
power in the whole town of Narachi!

2143
02:23:33,790 --> 02:23:36,829
Within 10 seconds of the power getting shut,
the jeep lights & torch lights were on!

2144
02:23:36,830 --> 02:23:37,869
In that 10 seconds time,

2145
02:23:37,870 --> 02:23:41,000
it is impossible for anyone
to pass unnoticed by us sir...

2146
02:23:43,290 --> 02:23:44,920
Where does this tunnel go?

2147
02:23:46,460 --> 02:23:48,289
In the whole of Naraachi,
only this tunnel...

2148
02:23:48,290 --> 02:23:50,080
Goes directly to the Boss's house!

2149
02:24:36,750 --> 02:24:38,419
Even if someone has short circuited it,

2150
02:24:38,420 --> 02:24:40,959
to cross Biligire and then
come here through the tunnel,

2151
02:24:40,960 --> 02:24:42,119
they need a lot of time...

2152
02:24:42,120 --> 02:24:43,539
By then, because you alerted them,

2153
02:24:43,540 --> 02:24:45,829
all the guards in the palace,

2154
02:24:45,830 --> 02:24:46,750
came to the Junior Boss's room

2155
02:24:46,751 --> 02:24:47,911
and escorted him to the fair!

2156
02:24:48,170 --> 02:24:49,790
Where else could he have gone...

2157
02:24:57,080 --> 02:24:58,170
Trumpets!

2158
02:25:22,080 --> 02:25:22,920
When the electricity was shut,

2159
02:25:22,921 --> 02:25:25,521
the guards who were here
too had come to the Junior Boss's room...

2160
02:25:26,540 --> 02:25:27,830
You don't worry sir,

2161
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,119
by the time boss finishes
the fair and returns,

2162
02:25:30,120 --> 02:25:31,960
the whole palace will be secured...

2163
02:25:37,250 --> 02:25:39,620
Bring the 3 prisioners in front guys...

2164
02:25:44,120 --> 02:25:45,120
Panju...

2165
02:26:02,580 --> 02:26:04,419
He short circuited and cut the electricity

2166
02:26:04,420 --> 02:26:06,540
not to enter the palace but to come here!

2167
02:26:06,790 --> 02:26:08,369
Ramana, he is still there...

2168
02:26:08,370 --> 02:26:10,079
Ramana, I am unable to catch the signal!

2169
02:26:10,080 --> 02:26:11,249
Everyone go to the fair

2170
02:26:11,250 --> 02:26:13,531
and also inform the Barracks
and ask everybody to come...

2171
02:26:23,540 --> 02:26:24,540
Ramana...

2172
02:26:24,580 --> 02:26:25,580
Ramana...

2173
02:26:25,790 --> 02:26:27,670
He is still there!

2174
02:26:44,830 --> 02:26:46,370
He is still there Ramana...

2175
02:26:46,960 --> 02:26:47,960
Ramana...

2176
02:27:04,790 --> 02:27:06,750
The cell where the 3 prisioners were,

2177
02:27:07,120 --> 02:27:07,920
One...

2178
02:27:07,921 --> 02:27:09,250
One prisioner is still there...

2179
02:27:31,250 --> 02:27:32,250
Hey...

2180
02:27:49,920 --> 02:27:51,289
Shantamma!

2181
02:27:51,290 --> 02:27:52,936
Hey! Stand right there!
- Mamma... Leave me!

2182
02:27:52,960 --> 02:27:54,039
Your son is going out of control!

2183
02:27:54,040 --> 02:27:55,619
He has formed a gang and
has gone to hit them up!

2184
02:27:55,620 --> 02:27:56,580
Not only did he go,

2185
02:27:56,581 --> 02:27:57,959
but he took our children too!

2186
02:27:57,960 --> 02:27:59,119
High time you you advised your son!

2187
02:27:59,120 --> 02:28:01,079
He tortured me in school daily mama!

2188
02:28:01,080 --> 02:28:02,790
That's why mama,
I went to hit him!

2189
02:28:04,870 --> 02:28:07,040
Hey... You took a gang and went!

2190
02:28:09,620 --> 02:28:10,500
Go alone!

2191
02:28:10,500 --> 02:28:11,500
Aiyo! Lord Shiva!

2192
02:28:19,790 --> 02:28:21,330
Hello...

2193
02:28:21,420 --> 02:28:22,250
Sir...

2194
02:28:22,370 --> 02:28:23,080
Tell Kulkarni...

2195
02:28:23,081 --> 02:28:24,169
He killed him sir...

2196
02:28:24,170 --> 02:28:25,210
What did you say,

2197
02:28:25,250 --> 02:28:26,170
Tell me again...

2198
02:28:26,250 --> 02:28:29,000
He has killed Garuda sir...

2199
02:28:35,460 --> 02:28:38,210
Everyone came know about Garuda's death!

2200
02:28:42,250 --> 02:28:45,370
Like Suryavardhan said...
The trumpets were waiting!

2201
02:28:47,420 --> 02:28:49,080
There is news from India...

2202
02:28:50,080 --> 02:28:52,370
The were waiting to destroy KGF...

2203
02:28:52,540 --> 02:28:54,580
Madam in KGF...

2204
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:57,710
Brother,

2205
02:28:57,710 --> 02:28:58,710
Garuda died...

2206
02:29:00,370 --> 02:29:01,870
They were also waiting to reclaim it!

2207
02:29:02,080 --> 02:29:03,040
Adeera!

2208
02:29:03,080 --> 02:29:03,790
Brother...

2209
02:29:03,870 --> 02:29:07,170
Till Garuda was alive, I will
not wish to desire this place...

2210
02:29:09,120 --> 02:29:14,120
My brother said that I
did not know politics...

2211
02:29:17,620 --> 02:29:20,370
But the fact that another person's
footsteps had fallen there...

2212
02:29:22,290 --> 02:29:23,710
This nobody knew!

2213
02:29:29,710 --> 02:29:32,540
Powerful people come
from powerful places...

2214
02:29:33,710 --> 02:29:37,670
When Andrews said he will give
Bombay like giving a candy,

2215
02:29:37,790 --> 02:29:40,750
for Rocky the ocean also
became just a well...

2216
02:29:45,500 --> 02:29:47,869
Thinking the ocean was elsewere,
he went searching for it...

2217
02:29:47,870 --> 02:29:50,170
when he saw Garuda, It was
confirmed to Rocky that

2218
02:29:50,370 --> 02:29:53,460
here is man who comes
from that powerful place.

2219
02:29:53,960 --> 02:29:55,289
So, even though he got a chance,

2220
02:29:55,290 --> 02:29:56,710
he did not finish him.

2221
02:29:57,290 --> 02:29:58,290
He left him...

2222
02:30:00,870 --> 02:30:03,750
To obtain KGF, he needed an army,

2223
02:30:06,040 --> 02:30:07,250
That's why Rocky,

2224
02:30:07,370 --> 02:30:09,250
in front of everyone he killed Garuda

2225
02:30:09,670 --> 02:30:11,710
And injected courage to
all those who witnessed it

2226
02:30:11,870 --> 02:30:13,870
and made them all his soldiers!

2227
02:30:17,500 --> 02:30:18,500
Hey...

2228
02:30:18,620 --> 02:30:20,119
What are you looking at?
Kill him!

2229
02:30:20,120 --> 02:30:24,500
If 400 people with guns were ready
to kill as ordered by Vanaram,

2230
02:30:24,870 --> 02:30:27,709
20,000 people had mustered
coyrage in their hearts

2231
02:30:27,710 --> 02:30:30,120
and were ready to die for Rocky!

2232
02:30:33,250 --> 02:30:37,000
If you draw courage from the thousand
people standing behind you...

2233
02:30:38,620 --> 02:30:40,540
Then you can win only one battle!

2234
02:30:42,250 --> 02:30:44,369
But if the fact that
you are leading them...

2235
02:30:44,370 --> 02:30:46,580
Makes those 1000 people behind you brave,

2236
02:30:48,870 --> 02:30:50,500
you can win the whole world!

2237
02:30:53,960 --> 02:30:55,250
Go...

2238
02:30:56,920 --> 02:30:57,920
Go alone!

2239
02:30:58,040 --> 02:31:02,830
He came...

2240
02:31:05,370 --> 02:31:07,710
This is still the first chapter...

2241
02:31:08,580 --> 02:31:09,600
The story...

2242
02:31:10,070 --> 02:31:11,070
I am enforcing the Army

2243
02:31:11,180 --> 02:31:12,260
And signing a Death Warrant

2244
02:31:13,130 --> 02:31:14,540
of the biggest criminal in India.

2245
02:31:17,170 --> 02:31:18,670
Now it is just the beginning...
