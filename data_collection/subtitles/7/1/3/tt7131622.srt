<i>This man is worth $500,</i>

3
00:00:32,148 --> 00:00:34,420
<i>and this man's
going to collect.</i>

4
00:00:34,547 --> 00:00:35,891
<i>He's Jake Cahill,</i>

5
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,332
<i>and he lives by...</i>

6
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:39,091
Bounty Law.

7
00:00:39,218 --> 00:00:41,780
You don't ever bring them in
alive, do you, Jake?

8
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:44,180
Not when there's three of them
and one of me.

9
00:00:49,204 --> 00:00:50,612
What are you looking at,
bounty killer?

10
00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:52,051
I'm looking
at an ugly owl-hoot

11
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,452
about to get his jaw busted.

12
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,563
Amateurs try
and take men in alive.

13
00:00:59,186 --> 00:01:00,627
Amateurs usually
don't make it.

14
00:01:00,756 --> 00:01:02,548
<i>Whether you're dead or alive,</i>

15
00:01:02,674 --> 00:01:06,099
<i>you're just a dollar sign</i>
<i>to Jake Cahill on</i> Bounty Law.

16
00:01:06,228 --> 00:01:08,691
<i>Thursdays at 8:30,
only on NBC.</i>

17
00:01:13,012 --> 00:01:13,843
Hello, everybody.

18
00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:15,092
This is Allen Kincade

19
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:17,043
on the set
of the exciting hit NBC

20
00:01:17,171 --> 00:01:19,444
and Screen Gems television
series <i>Bounty Law.</i>

21
00:01:19,572 --> 00:01:21,300
Now, if you think
you're seeing double,

22
00:01:21,427 --> 00:01:22,868
don't adjust
your television sets

23
00:01:22,996 --> 00:01:24,980
because, well,
in a way, you are.

24
00:01:25,108 --> 00:01:26,867
To my right
is <i>Bounty Law</i> series lead

25
00:01:26,996 --> 00:01:29,107
and Jake Cahill himself,
Rick Dalton.

26
00:01:29,236 --> 00:01:31,891
And to my left is Rick's
stunt double, Cliff Booth.

27
00:01:32,019 --> 00:01:33,683
Welcome and thanks for
taking the time

28
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:36,051
- to visit with us.
- It's our pleasure, Allen.

29
00:01:36,178 --> 00:01:37,876
So, Rick,
explain to the audience

30
00:01:38,004 --> 00:01:40,245
exactly what it is
a stunt double does.

31
00:01:41,139 --> 00:01:42,611
Well...

32
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:45,620
actors are required to do
a lot of dangerous stuff.

33
00:01:45,748 --> 00:01:48,562
Say Jake Cahill
gets shot off his horse.

34
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,803
Now, can I fall off
a horse?

35
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:53,491
Yes, I can,
and, yes, I have.

36
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:59,508
But say I fall off wrong
and I sprain my wrist

37
00:01:59,635 --> 00:02:01,012
or I... or I
twist my ankle.

38
00:02:01,139 --> 00:02:04,018
Now, that can put
an undue burden on production

39
00:02:04,148 --> 00:02:06,131
because now maybe
I can't work for a week.

40
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,852
So Cliff here is meant to help
carry the load.

41
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,251
Is that how you'd describe
your job, Cliff?

42
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,355
What, carrying his load?
Yeah, that's about right.

43
00:02:18,483 --> 00:02:20,979
Join me next week on the set
of <i>The Dick Van Dyke Show,</i>

44
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:22,868
where I'll be talking
to comical cutups,

45
00:02:22,996 --> 00:02:24,531
Morey Amsterdam
and Rose Marie.

46
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:27,763
Till then, this is Allen Kincade
signing off from Hollywood.

47
00:03:41,043 --> 00:03:43,251
Hi. I missed you.

48
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,075
The black one.
And the flowers.

49
00:03:49,203 --> 00:03:50,482
Flowers, Ava, flowers.

50
00:03:50,612 --> 00:03:51,924
And there's the small one.

51
00:03:52,051 --> 00:03:53,298
Can I see your tickets?

52
00:03:53,428 --> 00:03:55,764
Oh, good boy.

53
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:55,251
Gina, Gina, Gina.

54
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,979
The face
in the misty light.

55
00:04:57,107 --> 00:04:59,923
- Hello, Mr. Schwarz.
- Hello, Gina.

56
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:03,892
I, uh... I have a meeting
with a very handsome cowboy man.

57
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:05,939
He's waiting
for you in the bar.

58
00:05:06,643 --> 00:05:07,474
Ah.

59
00:05:07,604 --> 00:05:09,044
Well...

60
00:05:09,171 --> 00:05:10,836
since I just finished
watching

61
00:05:10,962 --> 00:05:13,042
a Rick Dalton
fucking film festival,

62
00:05:13,171 --> 00:05:15,730
I think I know who you are.
Put it there.

63
00:05:15,859 --> 00:05:18,194
Well, it's my pleasure,
Mr. Schwartz.

64
00:05:18,324 --> 00:05:20,050
And thank you
for taking an interest.

65
00:05:20,179 --> 00:05:21,652
<i>Schwarz,</i> not Schwartz.

66
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:24,500
Ah. G-goddamn it to hell.
I'm-I'm sorry about that.

67
00:05:24,627 --> 00:05:27,571
- It's my pleasure, Mr. Schwarz.
- Call me Marvin.

68
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:29,202
Marvin, call me Rick.

69
00:05:29,332 --> 00:05:30,580
- Rick?
- Yeah.

70
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,628
- Oh, is that your son?
- My son?

71
00:05:32,755 --> 00:05:35,060
No, that's my stunt double,
Cliff Booth. Yeah.

72
00:05:35,187 --> 00:05:36,882
- Good to meet you.
- We've worked together

73
00:05:37,011 --> 00:05:38,802
since the last two seasons
of <i>Bounty Law.</i>

74
00:05:38,932 --> 00:05:40,083
- Yeah?
- My car's in the shop,

75
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:41,460
so he gave me a ride.

76
00:05:41,587 --> 00:05:43,092
<i>That's a big fucking lie.</i>

77
00:05:43,219 --> 00:05:44,978
<i>Rick got his driver's license
taken away</i>

78
00:05:45,108 --> 00:05:46,613
<i>for too many
drunk-driving tickets.</i>

79
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,116
<i>Cliff drives him
everywhere now.</i>

80
00:05:48,243 --> 00:05:49,330
Oh, fuck.

81
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,868
Well, sounds
like a good friend.

82
00:05:50,995 --> 00:05:52,851
- I try.
- Mm.

83
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,507
I wanna send you greetings
from my wife,

84
00:05:55,634 --> 00:05:57,459
Mary Alice <i>Schwarz.</i>

85
00:05:57,587 --> 00:05:59,891
Oh, well, that's nice.

86
00:06:01,556 --> 00:06:03,220
Thanks a lot.

87
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:08,115
We had a Rick Dalton
double feature

88
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:09,843
in our screening room
last night.

89
00:06:09,971 --> 00:06:13,971
Oh, well, that's both
flattering and-and embarrassing.

90
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,604
What'd you see?

91
00:06:15,732 --> 00:06:18,483
Thirty-five mm prints
of <i>Tanner</i>

92
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:20,820
and <i>The Fourteen Fists</i>
<i>of McCluskey.</i>

93
00:06:26,675 --> 00:06:29,907
I hope the, uh,
Rick Dalton double feature

94
00:06:30,035 --> 00:06:33,011
wasn't too painful for you
and the... And the missus.

95
00:06:33,138 --> 00:06:36,979
Oh, no. "Painful." Stop.
What are you saying?

96
00:06:38,546 --> 00:06:40,020
<i>Mary Alice loves Westerns.</i>

97
00:06:40,146 --> 00:06:41,940
<i>Our whole courtship,
we watched Westerns.</i>

98
00:06:42,066 --> 00:06:43,603
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

99
00:06:43,731 --> 00:06:45,780
<i>And we thoroughly
enjoyed</i> Tanner.

100
00:06:45,907 --> 00:06:47,156
Oh, that's nice.

101
00:06:47,283 --> 00:06:49,332
It's really good.
And anyway, she goes to bed.

102
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:52,371
<i>I open up a box of Havanas.</i>

103
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:58,579
<i>I light up, I pour myself
a cognac and I watch...</i>

104
00:06:58,706 --> 00:07:01,043
<i>The Fourteen Fists
of McCluskey.</i>

105
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,739
What a picture.

106
00:07:02,868 --> 00:07:04,532
- What a picture.
- Good picture, yeah.

107
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:06,356
That is so much fun.

108
00:07:06,483 --> 00:07:07,442
All the shooting.

109
00:07:10,962 --> 00:07:12,915
I love that stuff.
You know, the killing.

110
00:07:13,042 --> 00:07:14,931
A lot of killing.
Lot of killing, yeah.

111
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:18,611
Now, gentlemen,
the plan is, we reverse our forces

112
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:21,588
<i>und</i> drive the Allies
back into the sea!

113
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:25,490
Genius.

114
00:07:25,618 --> 00:07:27,187
Panzer divisions come in,

115
00:07:27,315 --> 00:07:29,747
and we drive them here
to the ocean.

116
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,187
They'll be up against
the wall.

117
00:07:31,314 --> 00:07:33,299
- They will have nowhere to go.
- Yes.

118
00:07:33,428 --> 00:07:35,540
This is the spot...

119
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:37,810
Hermann!

120
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,724
Open the curtains.

121
00:07:59,698 --> 00:08:02,610
Anybody order
fried sauerkraut?

122
00:08:18,738 --> 00:08:22,099
Burn, you Nazi bastards!
Ha-ha-ha!

123
00:08:22,227 --> 00:08:25,940
That's you operating
the flamethrower, isn't it?

124
00:08:26,066 --> 00:08:27,890
Oh, you bet your sweet ass
it was. Yeah.

125
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,715
- It was you?
- Yeah. And let me tell you,

126
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:31,796
that-that's one shit-fuck
crazy weapon

127
00:08:31,923 --> 00:08:34,003
y-y-you do not wanna be
on the wrong side of.

128
00:08:34,132 --> 00:08:35,444
Boy, oh, boy.

129
00:08:35,571 --> 00:08:38,227
You know, I practiced
with that dragon, uh,

130
00:08:38,355 --> 00:08:40,051
three hours a day
for two weeks.

131
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:41,843
Not just because
I wanted to look good

132
00:08:41,971 --> 00:08:43,507
in the picture,
but because I was...

133
00:08:43,635 --> 00:08:45,651
I was shit-scared
of the thing, to be honest.

134
00:08:46,547 --> 00:08:48,082
Mike fucking Lewis!

135
00:08:48,211 --> 00:08:49,682
Crisping them Nazis
to hell!

136
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,282
Oh, shit, that's...

137
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,850
All right,
that's too hot.

138
00:08:52,979 --> 00:08:54,898
Anything we can do
about that heat?

139
00:08:55,026 --> 00:08:57,523
- Rick, it's a flamethrower.
- Yeah.

140
00:08:57,652 --> 00:09:00,723
So I came to the office
early today,

141
00:09:00,852 --> 00:09:06,164
and I watched two episodes
of <i>Bounty Law</i> on 16 mm.

142
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,922
Jody Janice,

143
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,323
wanted for cattle rustling
in the state of Wyoming,

144
00:09:10,452 --> 00:09:13,523
$425 dead or alive.

145
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,979
And you brought him here
to collect.

146
00:09:17,106 --> 00:09:19,603
I don't even know
where here is.

147
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,715
It was just
the closest place.

148
00:09:21,842 --> 00:09:24,530
Caught up with him about
five miles outside of town.

149
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:26,515
So, bounty killer,

150
00:09:26,642 --> 00:09:29,875
the name of this town
is Janicetown.

151
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,778
And that boy you killed...

152
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:37,010
was Jody Janice.

153
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:41,011
He was the baby boy
of Major Nathin Maxwell Janice.

154
00:09:41,138 --> 00:09:42,866
Hmm.

155
00:09:42,996 --> 00:09:46,707
Who's
Major Nathin Maxwell Janice?

156
00:09:46,835 --> 00:09:52,018
Well, I'll be sure
and introduce you

157
00:09:52,147 --> 00:09:54,163
when he gets here.

158
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,163

00:11:06,739 --> 00:11:08,532
I did that show, uh...

175
00:11:08,659 --> 00:11:11,794
<i>Bingo Martin</i> with that kid
Scott Brown. Yeah.

176
00:11:11,924 --> 00:11:15,059
And I got a <i>F.B.I.</i>
that-that airs this Sunday.

177
00:11:15,187 --> 00:11:18,611
You, um... You always play
the bad guy on these shows?

178
00:11:18,738 --> 00:11:21,330
- Y-yeah. Mm-hm.
- Yeah.

179
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,114
So, and they have a fight scene
at the end of them?

180
00:11:24,243 --> 00:11:25,811
Well, not... Not...

181
00:11:25,939 --> 00:11:28,115
Not <i>Land of the Giants</i>
or <i>F.B.I.,</i>

182
00:11:28,242 --> 00:11:31,058
- but the rest, yeah. Yeah.
- And you lose in the fight?

183
00:11:31,187 --> 00:11:34,708
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
I'm... I'm the heavy.

184
00:11:34,834 --> 00:11:38,804
Oh, that's an old trick
pulled by the networks.

185
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,723
Now, you take <i>Bingo Martin,</i>
for example.

186
00:11:40,851 --> 00:11:42,290
- Mm-hm.
- Right?

187
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:45,172
So you got a new guy
like Scott Brown.

188
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:48,210
You wanna build up
his bona fides, right?

189
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:50,451
So you hire a guy
from a canceled show

190
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,051
- to play the heavy.
- Hmm.

191
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:55,186
Then at the end of the show,
when they fight,

192
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:57,044
it's hero besting heavy.

193
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,571
But what the audience sees

194
00:11:59,699 --> 00:12:04,371
is Bingo Martin
whipping Jake Cahill's ass.

195
00:12:04,499 --> 00:12:05,970
- Uh-huh.
- You see?

196
00:12:06,099 --> 00:12:09,235
Then next week,
it's Ron Ely.

197
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:12,563
And next week,
it's Bob Conrad,

198
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,474
wearing his tight pants,
kicking your ass.

199
00:12:15,603 --> 00:12:17,779
Yeah.

200
00:12:17,907 --> 00:12:20,338
Now, in another couple of years,
playing punching bag

201
00:12:20,467 --> 00:12:23,411
to every swinging dick
new to the network,

202
00:12:23,538 --> 00:12:25,458
that's gonna have
a psychological effect

203
00:12:25,586 --> 00:12:28,850
on how the audience
perceives you.

204
00:12:28,979 --> 00:12:30,354
Right.

205
00:12:30,482 --> 00:12:32,243
So, Rick,

206
00:12:32,371 --> 00:12:35,060
who's gonna kick the shit
out of you next week?

207
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:38,003
Mannix?
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.?

208
00:12:38,131 --> 00:12:39,986
The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.?

209
00:12:40,114 --> 00:12:42,227
How about
Batman and Robin?

210
00:12:42,354 --> 00:12:43,890
Ping. Pow.

211
00:12:44,018 --> 00:12:45,812
Choom. Zoom.

212
00:12:47,828 --> 00:12:49,044
Down goes you.

213
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:52,531
Down goes your career
as a leading man.

214
00:12:54,099 --> 00:12:59,986
Or do you go to Rome
and star in Westerns

215
00:13:00,115 --> 00:13:02,867
and win fucking fights?

216
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:10,611
Ticket, señor?

217
00:13:17,971 --> 00:13:19,956
All right,
what's the matter, partner?

218
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,323
Well...

219
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:25,842
it's official, old buddy.
I'm a has-been.

220
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,434
What are you talking about?
What did that guy tell you?

221
00:13:28,563 --> 00:13:30,803
He told me the goddamn truth,
is what he told me.

222
00:13:33,042 --> 00:13:34,931
- Oh. Whoa.
- Oh, shit.

223
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:36,659
- Hey.
- I'm sorry about that.

224
00:13:36,788 --> 00:13:37,619
Sorry about that.

225
00:13:37,748 --> 00:13:39,347
Here. Put these on.

226
00:13:39,474 --> 00:13:40,979
Don't cry
in front of the Mexicans.

227
00:13:41,106 --> 00:13:43,763
- Son of a bitch.
- What's got you so upset, man?

228
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,066
Well, if coming face-to-face
with the failure

229
00:13:46,195 --> 00:13:48,178
that is your career
ain't worth crying about,

230
00:13:48,307 --> 00:13:49,842
then I don't know
what the fuck is.

231
00:13:49,972 --> 00:13:51,826
Right. That guy in there
turn you down?

232
00:13:51,954 --> 00:13:54,803
No. He wants to help me
get into Italian movies.

233
00:13:54,931 --> 00:13:56,563
Then what's the problem?

234
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,290
I gotta do
Italian goddamn movies!

235
00:13:58,419 --> 00:14:00,050
- That's the fucking problem!
- Come on.

236
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,028
Fucking bullshit! It doesn't
matter whether I cry in public.

237
00:14:03,155 --> 00:14:05,235
Nobody remembers
who the fuck I am anyway, huh?

238
00:14:05,362 --> 00:14:07,155
<i>...at the Hall of Justice here.</i>

239
00:14:07,283 --> 00:14:09,651
<i>The defense will try
to prove the killing of Kennedy</i>

240
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,443
- <i>was the product of a sick mind.</i>
- Fuck!

241
00:14:11,571 --> 00:14:14,002
- Thank you. Hey, let's go.
- Take me home, Cliff.

242
00:14:14,131 --> 00:14:15,700

Ten years of-of-of
treading water.

270
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:34,290
And now a race
to the bottom. Heh.

271
00:15:34,419 --> 00:15:36,530
Look, I never had much
of a career to speak of,

272
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:39,667
so I can't say I really know
how you feel.

273
00:15:39,794 --> 00:15:42,067
What are you talking about?
You're my stunt double.

274
00:15:42,194 --> 00:15:43,603
Come on, now. Shit.

275
00:15:43,731 --> 00:15:46,963
Rick, I'm your driver, man.
I'm-I'm your gofer.

276
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:49,524
I'm not complaining, man.
I like driving you around.

277
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,218
I like doing shit
around the house

278
00:15:51,346 --> 00:15:53,107
and house-sitting
in the Hollywood Hills

279
00:15:53,235 --> 00:15:55,443
when you're gone.

280
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,298
But I haven't been
a full-time stuntman

281
00:15:57,427 --> 00:15:58,930
for a while now,

282
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:00,626
and from where I'm standing,

283
00:16:00,755 --> 00:16:02,771
going to Rome to star
in movies does not sound

284
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:05,619
like the fate worse than death
that you seem to think it is.

285
00:16:05,746 --> 00:16:09,778
Come on, now. You ever seen
an-an Italian Western, huh?

286
00:16:09,907 --> 00:16:11,890
They're awful.
It's a fucking farce.

287
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:14,417
Yeah, how many you seen?
One? Two?

288
00:16:14,547 --> 00:16:17,491
I've seen enough, all right?
Nobody likes Spaghetti Westerns.

289
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,812
Oh, hell, man,
stay in L.A.

290
00:17:13,938 --> 00:17:15,442
Give it what fer
next pilot season.

291
00:17:15,571 --> 00:17:17,618
Nah, nah. I'm... I'm...

292
00:17:17,747 --> 00:17:20,723
I'm too insecure now
to score come pilot season.

293
00:17:20,851 --> 00:17:23,572
Screen Gems ain't gonna have
nothing good to say about me.

294
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:25,523
- You know that.
- Shit. You made <i>Bounty Law.</i>

295
00:17:25,649 --> 00:17:27,762
Nobody's gonna forgive me
for that last season.

296
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,235
- No matter what I do...
- Ah...

297
00:17:29,363 --> 00:17:31,090
...I'm always gonna be
the horse's ass

298
00:17:31,219 --> 00:17:32,755
that got <i>Bounty Law</i> canceled

299
00:17:32,882 --> 00:17:36,498
because I wanted some fucking
rinky-dink movie career.

300
00:17:38,034 --> 00:17:40,786
- Tom. My friend.
- I met him?

301
00:17:40,914 --> 00:17:42,130
No, you haven't met him.

302
00:17:42,258 --> 00:17:44,019
You won't meet him
because I don't think

303
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,011
- you'd like him.
- Why?

304
00:17:45,138 --> 00:17:46,578
Well...

305
00:17:48,657 --> 00:17:52,051
- Don't even joke.
- A joke? But they're scared.

306
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:06,611
Holy shit. Heh.

307
00:18:06,738 --> 00:18:09,043
That was Polanski.

308
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,611
That was Roman Polanski.

309
00:18:10,737 --> 00:18:12,882
He's lived there
for a month now.

310
00:18:13,011 --> 00:18:15,282
First time I seen him.
Ha-ha-ha.

311
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,299
Holy shit. Goddamn it.

312
00:18:20,306 --> 00:18:21,363
What do I always say?

313
00:18:21,491 --> 00:18:23,123
Most important thing
in this town is,

314
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,490
when you're making money,
you buy a house in town.

315
00:18:25,618 --> 00:18:28,082
You don't rent.
Eddie O'Brien taught me that.

316
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,194
Hollywood real estate
means you live here.

317
00:18:30,322 --> 00:18:33,586
You're not just visiting,
not just passing through.

318
00:18:33,714 --> 00:18:35,667
You fucking live here.

319
00:18:35,794 --> 00:18:37,299
Here I am flat
on my ass,

320
00:18:37,427 --> 00:18:39,379
and who I got living
next door to me?

321
00:18:39,506 --> 00:18:42,257
The director of <i>Rosemary's</i>
fucking <i>Baby,</i> that's who.

322
00:18:42,386 --> 00:18:44,562
Polanski, the hottest director
in town right now,

323
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,905
probably the world.

324
00:18:46,034 --> 00:18:47,923
He's my next-door neighbor.

325
00:18:48,051 --> 00:18:50,866
I mean, shit. I mean,
who knows what could happen?

326
00:18:50,995 --> 00:18:53,427
I could... I could be
one pool party away

327
00:18:53,556 --> 00:18:55,379
f-from starring
in a new Polanski movie.

328
00:18:55,505 --> 00:18:56,786
So you're feeling better
now?

329
00:18:56,915 --> 00:18:58,611
Aw, yeah, yeah.
Sorry about all that.

330
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:00,338
Give me my glasses back.

331
00:19:00,467 --> 00:19:02,321
Oh, come get them, fucker.
Come...

332
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,562
All right, all right,
Audie Murphy, relax.

333
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,962
- There you go.
- You need me for anything else?

334
00:19:07,092 --> 00:19:09,810
Nah, nah, nah. I got a lot
of lines to learn for tomorrow.

335
00:19:09,937 --> 00:19:11,090
- Shit. All right.
- All right.

336
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:12,658
I'm gonna get my carcass
on home.

337
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:14,641
- All right.
- All right, 7:15 a.m.

338
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,371
- Seven-fifteen.
- Out the door.

339
00:19:16,499 --> 00:19:17,779
- Out the door.
- In the car.

340
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:18,898
All right,
see you then.

341
00:22:04,177 --> 00:22:06,929
Hello, coming in. Hello.

342
00:22:07,057 --> 00:22:08,850
Hello, darling. Hello.

343
00:22:08,979 --> 00:22:11,059
Mm. Mm.

344
00:22:11,186 --> 00:22:12,754
Come here.

345
00:22:12,882 --> 00:22:14,802
Hello, sweetheart.

346
00:22:14,929 --> 00:22:18,099
Mm. How was your day?
Hmm?

347
00:22:18,227 --> 00:22:19,923
Wait till you see
what I got for you.

348
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:23,217
Wait until you see
what I got for you.

349
00:22:23,347 --> 00:22:25,234
Look what I got for you.

350
00:22:25,362 --> 00:22:26,769
Gonna blow your mind, man.

351
00:22:30,771 --> 00:22:32,659
Come here. Come here.

352
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:37,586
Ta, ta, ta. Oh!

353
00:23:35,026 --> 00:23:36,498
Was that a whine?

354
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,346
What did I tell you
about whining?

355
00:23:39,473 --> 00:23:40,786
You whine, you don't eat.

356
00:23:40,914 --> 00:23:42,545
I will throw this shit
in the trash.

357
00:23:42,674 --> 00:23:44,018
I don't wanna, but I will.

358
00:23:45,393 --> 00:23:46,225
You understand?

359
00:23:46,353 --> 00:23:48,817
All right.

360
00:24:22,803 --> 00:24:25,171
<i>I waited at
the bar till closing time,</i>

361
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:27,730
<i>but he never came back.</i>

362
00:24:27,858 --> 00:24:30,034
<i>Okay, Peggy, what happened?</i>

363
00:24:30,162 --> 00:24:32,689
<i>I don't know.
Everything was fine.</i>

364
00:24:32,819 --> 00:24:34,386
<i>We had dinner at my house.</i>

365
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:35,890
<i>And afterwards, you know,</i>

366
00:24:36,018 --> 00:24:37,746
- <i>while I was doing the dishes,</i>
- Tsk, tsk.

367
00:24:37,874 --> 00:24:40,081
<i>he and Tobey played.</i>

368
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:42,163
<i>And then, at the club,
Gabe was doing great.</i>

369
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:44,306
<i>Then, wham, a sudden change.</i>

370
00:24:44,435 --> 00:24:47,698
<i>You know how musicians are.
They're temperamental cats.</i>

371
00:24:47,826 --> 00:24:49,650
- <i>Who knows what got into him?</i>
- Yeah.

372
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:59,602
<i>Rick Dalton rehearsal
tape starting in five, four,</i>

373
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:02,193
<i>three, two, one.</i>

374
00:25:02,322 --> 00:25:06,450
Pepe, get your behind
behind that bar! I got a guest.

375
00:25:06,578 --> 00:25:07,953
<i>Johnny says...</i>

376
00:25:08,082 --> 00:25:10,994
<i>Spanish, Spanish, Spanish.</i>

377
00:25:11,123 --> 00:25:12,370
<i>How's the beans?</i>

378
00:25:12,498 --> 00:25:13,491
I've had worse.

379
00:25:15,121 --> 00:25:17,489
<i>Johnny says... Spanish.</i>

380
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:19,057
<i>A toast.</i>

381
00:25:19,186 --> 00:25:21,457
To my wife
and all my sweethearts.

382
00:25:21,585 --> 00:25:24,049
May they never meet.

383
00:25:24,178 --> 00:25:26,578
Señor Madrid,
care to join me at my table

384
00:25:26,706 --> 00:25:29,457
where I entertain my guests?

385
00:25:29,586 --> 00:25:32,530
<i>I would be
delighted, Monsieur Dakota.</i>

386
00:25:34,098 --> 00:25:36,723
Take the bottle with you.

387
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,802
<i>And Pepe comes over.</i>

388
00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:41,170
Hey, where's that chili pepper
daughter of yours

389
00:25:41,297 --> 00:25:42,610
with the fiddle?

390
00:25:42,738 --> 00:25:44,498
<i>She's asleep.</i>

391
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,609
Well, wake her the heck up,
get her down here

392
00:25:46,738 --> 00:25:49,651
with her fiddle and her bow,
and entertain my guests.

393
00:25:49,778 --> 00:25:52,210
<i>Sí, señor,
but please don't hurt her this time,</i>

394
00:25:52,338 --> 00:25:53,266
<i>I beg you.</i>

395
00:25:53,395 --> 00:25:54,802
I ain't gonna hurt her.

396
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:56,626
Just want her
to play the fiddle.

397
00:25:56,753 --> 00:25:58,290
Fetch her and tell her
I'll give her

398
00:25:58,418 --> 00:25:59,602
a fat $5 gold piece,

399
00:25:59,731 --> 00:26:02,514
she play her little chili pepper
heart out.

400
00:26:02,642 --> 00:26:05,458
So, Johnny, what else
you heard about me?

401
00:26:05,587 --> 00:26:08,241
<i>I heard you're
pushing Lancer pretty hard,</i>

402
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:10,035
<i>but Lancer has money.</i>

403
00:26:10,161 --> 00:26:14,483
<i>At some point, he's gonna hire
some guns and push back.</i>

404
00:26:16,498 --> 00:26:17,842
- Oops, sorry.
- It's okay.

405
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:20,050
I'll open the door for you.

406
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:21,714
You look good.

407
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:35,347
I think Steve's
gonna be there too.

408
00:26:35,474 --> 00:26:36,403
Oh, yeah.

409
00:27:47,505 --> 00:27:49,490
Oh, look. They're here.

410
00:28:03,666 --> 00:28:06,291
Welcome to the Playboy
Mansion, Mr. Polanski.

411
00:28:06,417 --> 00:28:09,297
Hey, how are you doing,
baby?

412
00:28:09,425 --> 00:28:12,081
Hey! Heh. How are you?

413
00:28:24,498 --> 00:28:26,642
Oh, Cass!

414
00:28:37,937 --> 00:28:39,603
Yeah!

415
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,131
Yeah, baby!

416
00:28:48,785 --> 00:28:51,666
Yeah! Whoo! Whoo!

417
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,649
Oh, yeah.

418
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:35,986
I'm gonna tell you a story.

419
00:29:36,114 --> 00:29:38,738
She was engaged to him.

420
00:29:41,778 --> 00:29:47,603
Then she flew
to the UK...

421
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:49,809
to make a film
with him,

422
00:29:49,938 --> 00:29:55,250
and broke off her engagement
with him and married him.

423
00:29:56,625 --> 00:30:00,178
Then they moved
to Los Angeles,

424
00:30:00,305 --> 00:30:02,288
and the three of them

425
00:30:02,417 --> 00:30:04,177
have been inseparable.

426
00:30:04,305 --> 00:30:06,451
Really?

427
00:30:07,921 --> 00:30:09,523
What's up?

428
00:30:11,121 --> 00:30:14,353
Jay loves Sharon,
that's what's up.

429
00:30:14,482 --> 00:30:17,394
- Mm.
- And he knows...

430
00:30:17,521 --> 00:30:20,658
as sure as God made
little green apples...

431
00:30:22,162 --> 00:30:24,082
that one of these days,
that Polish prick's

432
00:30:24,209 --> 00:30:25,458
gonna fuck things up,

433
00:30:25,586 --> 00:30:28,690
and when he does,
Jay's gonna be there.

434
00:30:28,817 --> 00:30:30,962
Well, one thing's
for sure.

435
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,689
Yeah?

436
00:30:32,819 --> 00:30:33,969
What's that?

437
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:37,457
Sharon absolutely has a type.

438
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,690
Cute, short, talented guys

439
00:30:40,817 --> 00:30:43,506
who look
like 12-year-old boys.

440
00:30:43,635 --> 00:30:45,362
Yeah.

441
00:30:48,851 --> 00:30:51,059
I never stood a chance.

442
00:31:27,697 --> 00:31:29,715
Argh. Fuck you,
Dr. Sapirstein.

443
00:32:12,496 --> 00:32:13,969
Oh, here we are.

444
00:32:16,402 --> 00:32:20,594
Tell transpo!
Gonna need to move all that out!

445
00:32:20,721 --> 00:32:23,122
Just a sec. Hold on, guys.

446
00:32:23,249 --> 00:32:24,082
Go ahead.

447
00:32:27,442 --> 00:32:29,234
You can talk to him.
Just talk to him.

448
00:32:29,361 --> 00:32:31,281
- Get that set in place.
- Hey.

449
00:32:31,409 --> 00:32:34,930
Ahem. I think the wind blew
down my TV antenna last night,

450
00:32:35,058 --> 00:32:37,650
so while I piss-fart
around with wardrobe,

451
00:32:37,778 --> 00:32:39,251
you mind going home
and fixing it?

452
00:32:39,377 --> 00:32:42,097
I can. You talk to
the stunt gaffer about me today?

453
00:32:42,225 --> 00:32:44,498
That way I'll know
if I'm working this week or not.

454
00:32:44,624 --> 00:32:46,704
Yeah. Ahem.
I've been meaning to tell you.

455
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:50,769
The guy who gaffs this,
he's best friends with Randy,

456
00:32:50,898 --> 00:32:52,369
the gaffer
from <i>The Green Hornet...</i>

457
00:32:52,498 --> 00:32:54,642
...so there ain't no point.

458
00:32:54,769 --> 00:32:57,042
If you don't need me,
I'll pick you up at wrap.

459
00:32:57,168 --> 00:32:59,281
I don't need you. Not today.

460
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:03,090
Go home, fix my antenna,
do whatever. See you at wrap.

461
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,634
Hey!

462
00:33:07,761 --> 00:33:10,801
You're Rick fucking Dalton.
Don't you forget it.

463
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:21,618
Hey, hey.

464
00:33:21,746 --> 00:33:22,993
Hey, buddy,
I'm Rick Dalton.

465
00:33:23,122 --> 00:33:24,593
You know
where I'm supposed to go?

466
00:33:24,722 --> 00:33:26,770
They're waiting for you
in the makeup trailer.

467
00:33:26,897 --> 00:33:28,530
Where's the makeup trailer?

468
00:33:28,657 --> 00:33:30,643
Straight back the way you came,
hard right.

469
00:33:35,474 --> 00:33:37,363
Oh, my God.

470
00:33:42,898 --> 00:33:44,241
Rick Dalton.

471
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:45,585
Sam Wanamaker.

472
00:33:45,713 --> 00:33:47,121
Hey, Sam.

473
00:33:47,249 --> 00:33:48,338
Sorry about the wet hand.

474
00:33:48,467 --> 00:33:50,258
Oh, don't worry.
I'm used to it with Yul.

475
00:33:50,385 --> 00:33:52,688
I want you to know,
I'm the one who cast you.

476
00:33:52,817 --> 00:33:55,378
And I couldn't be more
delighted you're doing this.

477
00:33:55,505 --> 00:33:56,624
Oh, well, thank you, Sam.

478
00:33:56,754 --> 00:33:59,090
I... I appreciate it.
It's a good part.

479
00:33:59,217 --> 00:34:02,002
Yeah, it is. Have you met
Jim Stacy, the series lead?

480
00:34:02,129 --> 00:34:03,379
Uh, not yet, no. No.

481
00:34:03,505 --> 00:34:06,129
Well, you guys are going
to be dynamite together.

482
00:34:06,258 --> 00:34:07,154
Mm. Mm.

483
00:34:07,281 --> 00:34:09,489
Well, it sounds exciting.

484
00:34:09,617 --> 00:34:11,569
- Yeah, lightning in a bottle.
- Mm.

485
00:34:11,697 --> 00:34:13,714
Now, you met Sonya,
makeup and hair?

486
00:34:13,841 --> 00:34:14,960
Hi.

487
00:34:15,089 --> 00:34:16,977
And this is Rebekka,
who does costumes.

488
00:34:17,105 --> 00:34:18,449
Hello.

489
00:34:18,578 --> 00:34:19,858
- Hi.
- Howdy.

490
00:34:19,984 --> 00:34:21,649
I want a whole
new look for Caleb.

491
00:34:21,778 --> 00:34:23,249
I don't want this
Western costumed

492
00:34:23,378 --> 00:34:24,914
the way they costumed
<i>The Big Valley</i>

493
00:34:25,041 --> 00:34:26,674
and <i>Bonanza</i>
for the last decade.

494
00:34:26,802 --> 00:34:29,299
I want a zeitgeist flair
to the costumes.

495
00:34:30,866 --> 00:34:32,241
I mean,
nothing anachronistic,

496
00:34:32,369 --> 00:34:36,401
but where does 1869
and 1969 meet?

497
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:38,960
Especially when it comes
to you, Caleb.

498
00:34:39,089 --> 00:34:40,370
Mm. Mm.

499
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:42,289
First off,
I want to give him a mustache.

500
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:46,801
A big, droopy,
Zapata-like mustache.

501
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:48,850
Now, about his jacket.

502
00:34:48,978 --> 00:34:50,642
I want to give him
a hippie jacket.

503
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:53,042
Something he could wear
into the London Fog tonight

504
00:34:53,169 --> 00:34:55,058
and look like the hippest guy
in the room.

505
00:34:55,186 --> 00:34:57,265
Far out.
We got a Custer jacket.

506
00:34:57,393 --> 00:34:58,897
Fringes all down the arm.

507
00:34:59,026 --> 00:35:01,681
It's tan now,
but I dye it dark brown,

508
00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:03,698
he could hit the Strip in it
tonight.

509
00:35:03,826 --> 00:35:05,712
That's my girl. Heh.

510
00:35:05,841 --> 00:35:08,562
- Now, Rick, about your hair.
- What about my hair?

511
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,449
I want to go
with a different hairstyle.

512
00:35:10,578 --> 00:35:11,569
Huh. What?

513
00:35:11,698 --> 00:35:14,194
Something
more hippie-ish.

514
00:35:14,322 --> 00:35:17,457
You want me
to look like a hippie?

515
00:35:17,586 --> 00:35:20,434
Well, think less hippie,
more...

516
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,553
Hells Angel!

517
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:25,938
- Right. Say, Sam...
- Get me the...

518
00:35:26,064 --> 00:35:28,721
Sam. Sam, uh...

519
00:35:28,849 --> 00:35:30,641
if you got me covered up
in all this...

520
00:35:30,769 --> 00:35:32,976
this junk, uh,

521
00:35:33,105 --> 00:35:34,801
how's the audience
gonna know it's me?

522
00:35:35,856 --> 00:35:36,881
I hope they don't.

523
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,162
Mm.

524
00:35:38,289 --> 00:35:42,481
I don't want them to see
Jake Cahill.

525
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:45,328
I want them to see Caleb.

526
00:35:45,457 --> 00:35:48,145
I hired you
to be an actor, Rick.

527
00:35:48,274 --> 00:35:51,282
Not a TV cowboy.
You're better than that.

528
00:38:55,057 --> 00:38:58,641
<i>I've been meaning to tell
you, the guy who gaffs this,</i>

529
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,082
<i>he's best friends
with Randy,</i>

530
00:39:00,208 --> 00:39:01,680
<i>the gaffer</i>
<i>from</i> The Green Hornet,

531
00:39:01,809 --> 00:39:04,049
<i>so there really
ain't no point.</i>

532
00:39:18,769 --> 00:39:19,954
Hey, Randy.

533
00:39:22,258 --> 00:39:24,082
Cliff.

534
00:39:24,209 --> 00:39:26,417
So you're still with Rick,
huh?

535
00:39:26,545 --> 00:39:27,410
Still here.

536
00:39:28,849 --> 00:39:29,681
He in there?

537
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:31,762
Yeah. Just knock.

538
00:39:35,954 --> 00:39:38,641
Look, just put him
in the wardrobe, all right?

539
00:39:38,768 --> 00:39:39,824
What's it gonna hurt?

540
00:39:39,953 --> 00:39:41,489
Then if you need him,
you got him.

541
00:39:41,618 --> 00:39:43,186
But then I gotta have
a conversation

542
00:39:43,313 --> 00:39:44,817
with that
wardrobe assistant,

543
00:39:44,945 --> 00:39:47,600
- and, man, she's a fucking bitch.
- I just don't... Please, I...

544
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:50,384
Look, Randy, I'm asking you
to help me out, man.

545
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,146
If the answer's no,
the answer's no,

546
00:39:52,273 --> 00:39:54,641
not no with excuses.

547
00:39:54,768 --> 00:39:56,944
Hey, man.

548
00:39:57,072 --> 00:40:00,017
This ain't a fucking
Andy McLaglen picture, you know?

549
00:40:00,146 --> 00:40:02,769
I can't afford to hire a bunch
of guys to smoke cigarettes

550
00:40:02,897 --> 00:40:04,849
and sit around talking
to each other all day

551
00:40:04,977 --> 00:40:06,512
on the chance
that I might use them.

552
00:40:06,641 --> 00:40:08,081
I got a four-man team here,
Rick.

553
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:10,448
If I need more than that,
I gotta get it approved.

554
00:40:10,578 --> 00:40:12,913
And, you know,
I gotta look after my dudes.

555
00:40:13,042 --> 00:40:15,793
Hey, and if your dudes
were a better match for me,

556
00:40:15,921 --> 00:40:17,297
I'd say, "Okay, you got me,"

557
00:40:17,425 --> 00:40:19,889
but-but that's not the case,
and you know it.

558
00:40:20,018 --> 00:40:22,001
- He's a great match for me.
- Yeah, no...

559
00:40:22,129 --> 00:40:24,049
Hey, you could do
anything you want to him.

560
00:40:24,177 --> 00:40:27,121
Throw him off a building, right?
Light him on fire.

561
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,978
Hit him with
a fucking Lincoln, right?

562
00:40:29,106 --> 00:40:30,609
Get creative.
Do whatever you want.

563
00:40:30,737 --> 00:40:32,337
He's just happy
for the opportunity.

564
00:40:32,464 --> 00:40:34,417
- Rick.
- Yeah?

565
00:40:36,497 --> 00:40:38,321
I don't dig him.

566
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:43,088
And I don't dig the vibe
he brings on a set.

567
00:40:43,217 --> 00:40:45,746
What, is there some old beef
between the two of you?

568
00:40:45,873 --> 00:40:48,048
- Oh, come on, man.
- What? What?

569
00:40:48,177 --> 00:40:50,290
The dude killed
his fucking wife.

570
00:40:52,176 --> 00:40:55,346
Come on, man. You don't believe
that old shit, do you?

571
00:40:55,472 --> 00:40:57,009
Yes, Rick, I do.

572
00:40:57,136 --> 00:41:00,049
And I work with my wife,
and she believes it.

573
00:41:00,177 --> 00:41:02,257
She doesn't want
his creepy ass around.

574
00:41:04,498 --> 00:41:05,969
You know, this is probably

575
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:08,209
the shittiest weather ever.

576
00:41:08,338 --> 00:41:11,312
The shittiest weather
on the shittiest boat

577
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,881
with the shittiest person.

578
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:17,969
Natalie, my sister, said,
"He's a loser. He's a loser."

579
00:41:18,098 --> 00:41:19,953
They all said it,
"He's a fucking loser,"

580
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,296
and I didn't believe them.

581
00:41:21,425 --> 00:41:24,242
So I guess
I'm the fucking idiot.

582
00:41:24,368 --> 00:41:25,937
And now you're not
gonna talk to me?

583
00:41:26,064 --> 00:41:28,240
What, you don't feel
like fighting?

584
00:41:28,369 --> 00:41:29,937
Well, I feel like
fucking fighting

585
00:41:30,064 --> 00:41:32,048
because I've been up here
by myself

586
00:41:32,178 --> 00:41:35,602
for four hours on this
fucking shithole of a boat.

587
00:41:35,729 --> 00:41:37,298
Yeah.

588
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:42,416
H-he's a goddamn
war hero. Fuck.

589
00:41:44,656 --> 00:41:45,810
Yeah, appreciate it.

590
00:41:49,744 --> 00:41:54,738
Okay, you fucking horse's ass.
Let's get you over to wardrobe.

591
00:41:57,297 --> 00:41:59,154
Now, I'll put you
in wardrobe,

592
00:41:59,281 --> 00:42:01,778
but you don't stunt,
I don't pay you.

593
00:42:01,905 --> 00:42:04,690
Appreciate the opportunity,
Randy. I won't let you down.

594
00:42:04,817 --> 00:42:07,376
You know my wife Janet,
don't you?

595
00:42:07,504 --> 00:42:08,816
Yeah.

596
00:42:08,944 --> 00:42:11,057
Steer clear of her.

597
00:42:11,186 --> 00:42:14,258
Now, I admire
Cassius Clay, I do.

598
00:42:14,386 --> 00:42:16,530
What I admire is,
in his sport,

599
00:42:16,657 --> 00:42:18,801
there's an element
of true combat.

600
00:42:18,928 --> 00:42:21,361
When Cassius Clay meets
Sonny Liston in the ring,

601
00:42:21,489 --> 00:42:23,601
that's not two athletes
posturing.

602
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:25,521
That's combat.

603
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:28,688
Two men trying to kill
each other right now.

604
00:42:28,817 --> 00:42:30,768
If you don't beat him...

605
00:42:30,897 --> 00:42:32,881
he kills you.

606
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:34,545
That's beyond athletics.

607
00:42:34,674 --> 00:42:38,097
That's beyond
<i>Wide World of Sports,</i> you know?

608
00:42:38,225 --> 00:42:40,016
That's two warriors
engaged in combat.

609
00:42:40,145 --> 00:42:42,481
That's what I admire.

610
00:42:42,609 --> 00:42:43,889
In martial arts tournaments,

611
00:42:44,018 --> 00:42:45,521
they won't let you fight
like that.

612
00:42:45,649 --> 00:42:47,569
It's very frustrating.

613
00:42:47,697 --> 00:42:48,945
You stand in front of a guy,

614
00:42:49,074 --> 00:42:51,761
and you just wanna let him
have it. Ha!

615
00:42:51,889 --> 00:42:53,361
But you can't.

616
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:57,264
So you gotta do this
playacting, patty-cake version.

617
00:42:57,392 --> 00:43:00,368
Cassius Clay. Sonny Liston.
Joe Louis.

618
00:43:00,497 --> 00:43:01,522
The colored boxer,

619
00:43:01,649 --> 00:43:03,249
not that white
kickboxing asshole.

620
00:43:04,529 --> 00:43:07,122
They do what
they need to do to win.

621
00:43:07,248 --> 00:43:09,072
They unleash
as much punishment

622
00:43:09,201 --> 00:43:11,441
as they have to
to defeat the other guy.

623
00:43:12,561 --> 00:43:14,129
But in martial arts
tournaments,

624
00:43:14,257 --> 00:43:16,529
I do to win what
they do to win.

625
00:43:16,657 --> 00:43:19,442
I unleash all my power.

626
00:43:20,176 --> 00:43:21,776
I kill people.

627
00:43:21,904 --> 00:43:23,922
If you fought Cassius
Clay, who would win?

628
00:43:24,049 --> 00:43:26,608
Well,
that would never happen.

629
00:43:26,736 --> 00:43:29,137
But if you did,
what do you think would happen?

630
00:43:30,289 --> 00:43:31,570
I'd make him a cripple.

631
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,456
Hey, you. What's your name?

632
00:43:37,585 --> 00:43:39,889
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

633
00:43:41,136 --> 00:43:42,608
My name's Cliff.

634
00:43:42,738 --> 00:43:44,658
I'm Rick Dalton's
stunt double.

635
00:43:44,784 --> 00:43:47,282
- Stuntman?
- Yeah.

636
00:43:47,408 --> 00:43:49,808
You know,
you're kind of pretty for a stuntman.

637
00:43:49,936 --> 00:43:51,601
That's what they tell me.

638
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:55,440
So did I say something
funny, stuntman?

639
00:43:55,569 --> 00:43:58,480
- Yeah, you kind of did.
- What's so funny?

640
00:43:58,609 --> 00:44:00,529
Look, man,
I don't want any trouble.

641
00:44:00,657 --> 00:44:02,000
I'm just here
to do a job.

642
00:44:02,128 --> 00:44:03,858
But you're laughing at
what I'm saying.

643
00:44:03,984 --> 00:44:05,456
But I'm not saying
anything funny.

644
00:44:05,585 --> 00:44:07,793
So, what do you think
is so funny?

645
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,089
What I think is...

646
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,632
you're a little man
with a big mouth and a big chip,

647
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,393
and I think you
should be embarrassed

648
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,569
to suggest you'd be
anything more than a stain

649
00:44:19,697 --> 00:44:22,353
on the seat
of Cassius Clay's trunks.

650
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,200
Brother, you're the one
with the big mouth.

651
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,928
And I would really
enjoy closing it,

652
00:44:27,057 --> 00:44:29,936
especially in front
of all my friends.

653
00:44:30,064 --> 00:44:33,265
But my hands are registered
as lethal weapons.

654
00:44:33,393 --> 00:44:35,568
That means,
we get into a fight,

655
00:44:35,697 --> 00:44:39,440
I accidentally kill you,
I go to jail.

656
00:44:39,569 --> 00:44:41,105
Anybody accidentally
kills anybody

657
00:44:41,232 --> 00:44:42,448
in a fight,
they go to jail.

658
00:44:42,577 --> 00:44:43,922
It's called
manslaughter.

659
00:44:44,049 --> 00:44:46,097
And I think all that
"lethal weapon" horseshit

660
00:44:46,224 --> 00:44:47,665
is just an excuse
so you dancers

661
00:44:47,793 --> 00:44:49,841
never have to get
in a real fight.

662
00:44:51,024 --> 00:44:51,889
Okay.

663
00:44:53,073 --> 00:44:54,802
How about
a friendly contest?

664
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:57,808
No punching in the face.

665
00:44:57,937 --> 00:44:59,409
Two out of three.

666
00:44:59,538 --> 00:45:01,457
Who puts who
on the ground first?

667
00:45:01,584 --> 00:45:06,257
Nobody tries to hurt nobody,
just who ends up on their butt?

668
00:45:09,905 --> 00:45:12,273
That's a great idea, Kato.

669
00:45:23,441 --> 00:45:25,361
You know, Bruce,
that guy's kind of famous.

670
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:26,930
That guy?

671
00:45:27,056 --> 00:45:28,368
For what?

672
00:45:28,498 --> 00:45:30,770
Killed his wife
and got away with it.

673
00:45:30,897 --> 00:45:31,986
That guy?

674
00:45:32,113 --> 00:45:33,585
That guy.

675
00:45:57,168 --> 00:45:58,449
Not bad, Kato.

676
00:45:59,728 --> 00:46:01,457
Try that again.

677
00:46:40,849 --> 00:46:43,088
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

678
00:46:43,216 --> 00:46:44,880
What the fuck
is going on here?

679
00:46:45,009 --> 00:46:47,986
Hey, jackass,
this is our series lead.

680
00:46:48,112 --> 00:46:49,617
What the fuck
are you thinking?

681
00:46:49,744 --> 00:46:51,856
You're right, Janet.
I'm sorry about that.

682
00:46:51,985 --> 00:46:54,449
Don't fucking "Janet" me,
you prick.

683
00:46:54,577 --> 00:46:56,689
Hey.
What's up, babe?

684
00:46:56,817 --> 00:47:00,017
What's up, Randy,
is that your loser asshole,

685
00:47:00,144 --> 00:47:03,217
wife-killing buddy boy here was
beating the shit out of Bruce.

686
00:47:03,344 --> 00:47:04,687
What?

687
00:47:04,817 --> 00:47:06,738
- Hey, Randy.
- Cliff.

688
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:08,529
What the fuck, man?

689
00:47:08,657 --> 00:47:11,953
Let me just say, nobody beat
the shit out of Bruce.

690
00:47:12,082 --> 00:47:14,257
It was a friendly contest.
He barely touched me.

691
00:47:14,385 --> 00:47:16,850
I think that dent in the car
says something different.

692
00:47:18,449 --> 00:47:20,562
Oh, my God!

693
00:47:20,688 --> 00:47:22,992
What the fuck
did you do to my car?!

694
00:47:23,121 --> 00:47:25,169
What the fuck
did you do to her car?

695
00:47:25,296 --> 00:47:27,185
I threw this
little prick into it,

696
00:47:27,313 --> 00:47:29,169
but I did not know
it was her car.

697
00:47:29,295 --> 00:47:33,583
Get the wardrobe off,
get your shit, and get fucked!

698
00:47:33,712 --> 00:47:34,609
- Janet!
- What?

699
00:47:34,737 --> 00:47:35,761
I will handle this.

700
00:47:35,889 --> 00:47:37,424
Then fucking handle it,
Randy.

701
00:47:38,865 --> 00:47:39,730
Cliff...

702
00:47:40,945 --> 00:47:43,921
get the wardrobe off,
get your shit,

703
00:47:44,049 --> 00:47:45,682
and get off the lot.

704
00:47:48,592 --> 00:47:49,937
Fair enough.

705
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,136
Aw. What's the matter?

706
00:48:25,264 --> 00:48:28,944
Are you afraid I'll tell
Jim Morrison you were dancing

707
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:31,280
to Paul Revere
and the Raiders?

708
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:33,201
Are they not
cool enough for you?

709
00:48:42,416 --> 00:48:44,816
Who's this
shaggy asshole?

710
00:48:46,447 --> 00:48:47,729
Hello? Can I help you?

711
00:48:47,855 --> 00:48:50,448
Oh, yeah. Hey, man.
I'm looking for Terry.

712
00:48:50,576 --> 00:48:53,488
I'm a friend of Terry's
and Dennis Wilson's.

713
00:48:53,616 --> 00:48:55,666
Well, Terry and Candy
don't live here anymore.

714
00:48:55,793 --> 00:48:57,329
This is the Polanski
residence now.

715
00:48:57,456 --> 00:48:59,697
Really? He moved?

716
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:01,169
Dang.

717
00:49:02,449 --> 00:49:04,208
Uh, you know...?
You know where?

718
00:49:04,337 --> 00:49:06,512
I'm not sure,
but the owner of the property,

719
00:49:06,642 --> 00:49:09,393
Paul, might.
He's in the guest house.

720
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,928
Who is it, Jay?

721
00:49:11,056 --> 00:49:14,353
It's okay, honey.
It's a friend of Terry's.

722
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,496
Yeah, just take
the back path.

723
00:49:16,625 --> 00:49:17,713
Thank you kindly.

724
00:49:19,761 --> 00:49:21,041
Ma'am.

725
00:49:36,272 --> 00:49:38,448
- All right, that's an hour!
- Hey, Rick.

726
00:49:38,576 --> 00:49:40,081
I know they just
broke for lunch,

727
00:49:40,209 --> 00:49:42,801
but you need to wait at least
an hour before you can eat.

728
00:49:42,928 --> 00:49:45,488
- Give that glue a chance to dry.
- Oh, no worries, honey.

729
00:49:45,616 --> 00:49:49,744
I got my book. Say, say,
where's the bad-guy saloon?

730
00:49:49,872 --> 00:49:51,888
You just go straight
through the Western town,

731
00:49:52,017 --> 00:49:54,385
take a right and a left,
and you see it right there.

732
00:49:54,513 --> 00:49:57,009
Thanks, honey.

733
00:49:58,322 --> 00:50:00,242
Can we move to number two?

734
00:50:00,368 --> 00:50:01,776
How is his bounce?

735
00:50:01,905 --> 00:50:03,439
Can I get a bounce there?

736
00:50:03,569 --> 00:50:05,968
Just grab the crescent
wrench, come right back.

737
00:50:06,097 --> 00:50:07,249
Just make it a quick one.

738
00:50:08,529 --> 00:50:10,962
- Tim!
- Looks great. Right there.

739
00:50:54,768 --> 00:50:56,048
Hello.

740
00:50:58,288 --> 00:50:59,154
Hello.

741
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:03,089
Hello.

742
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:06,320
Would...

743
00:51:06,448 --> 00:51:08,080
Would it bother you
if I sat

744
00:51:08,209 --> 00:51:10,130
next to you
and read my book too?

745
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:13,841
I don't know.

746
00:51:14,736 --> 00:51:16,720
Would you bother me?

747
00:51:16,849 --> 00:51:18,258
I'll try not to.

748
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,610
Sit.

749
00:52:05,777 --> 00:52:06,737
Ah.

750
00:52:07,921 --> 00:52:11,600
Sorry. Sorry about that.
Ahem.

751
00:52:16,721 --> 00:52:17,937
You don't eat lunch?

752
00:52:19,249 --> 00:52:21,328
I've got a scene
after lunch.

753
00:52:21,456 --> 00:52:22,417
Yeah?

754
00:52:23,984 --> 00:52:27,121
Eating lunch before I do
a scene makes me sluggish.

755
00:52:27,249 --> 00:52:28,976
I believe it's the job
of an actor...

756
00:52:29,105 --> 00:52:31,120
And I say "actor,"
not "actress,"

757
00:52:31,249 --> 00:52:33,936
because the word "actress"
is nonsensical.

758
00:52:34,065 --> 00:52:36,209
It's the actor's job
to avoid

759
00:52:36,336 --> 00:52:38,288
impediments
to their performance.

760
00:52:38,415 --> 00:52:42,801
It's the actor's job to strive
for 100 percent effectiveness.

761
00:52:42,927 --> 00:52:46,864
Naturally, we never succeed,
but it's the pursuit...

762
00:52:47,633 --> 00:52:49,009
that's meaningful.

763
00:52:50,353 --> 00:52:52,945
- Who are you?
- You can call me Marabella.

764
00:52:53,072 --> 00:52:55,855
Mar... Marabella what?

765
00:52:55,984 --> 00:52:57,392
Marabella Lancer.

766
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:00,656
No, no, come on, come on.
What's your real name?

767
00:53:02,704 --> 00:53:04,593
When we're on set,
I'd prefer to only

768
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,575
be referred to
by my character's name.

769
00:53:06,704 --> 00:53:09,680
It helps me invest
in the reality of the story.

770
00:53:09,808 --> 00:53:11,889
I've tried it both ways,
and I'm always just

771
00:53:12,017 --> 00:53:14,129
a tiny bit better
when I don't break character.

772
00:53:14,256 --> 00:53:17,650
And if I can be
a tiny bit better, I want to be.

773
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:23,569
You're the bad guy.
Caleb DeCoteau.

774
00:53:27,088 --> 00:53:30,257
I thought it was
pronounced Caleb "Dakota."

775
00:53:30,385 --> 00:53:33,360
I'm pretty sure
it's "DeCoteau."

776
00:53:35,569 --> 00:53:37,297
- DeCoteau.
- Mm.

777
00:53:38,705 --> 00:53:41,424
DeCoteau. DeCoteau.

778
00:53:42,609 --> 00:53:43,889
Hmm.

779
00:53:58,608 --> 00:53:59,888
What are you reading?

780
00:54:01,168 --> 00:54:03,536
It's a biography
on Walt Disney.

781
00:54:03,664 --> 00:54:05,167
It's fascinating.

782
00:54:05,296 --> 00:54:07,056
He's a genius, you know.

783
00:54:07,184 --> 00:54:10,416
I mean, a once-in-every-50
-or-100-years kind of genius.

784
00:54:10,544 --> 00:54:12,530
What are you, 12?

785
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:14,481
I'm 8.

786
00:54:15,344 --> 00:54:17,040
What are you reading?

787
00:54:18,545 --> 00:54:19,729
Just a Western.

788
00:54:19,857 --> 00:54:22,672
What does that mean?
Is it good?

789
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,649
- Pretty good.
- What's the story?

790
00:54:27,024 --> 00:54:28,657
I haven't finished
it yet.

791
00:54:28,783 --> 00:54:31,759
I didn't ask
for the whole story.

792
00:54:31,888 --> 00:54:33,521
What's the idea
of the story?

793
00:54:34,897 --> 00:54:36,304
Well... ahem,

794
00:54:36,433 --> 00:54:39,377
it's about this guy
who's a bronco buster.

795
00:54:40,528 --> 00:54:42,416
It's the story
of his life.

796
00:54:43,696 --> 00:54:45,424
Guy's name
is Tom Breezy,

797
00:54:45,552 --> 00:54:48,465
but everyone always
calls him Easy Breezy.

798
00:54:48,591 --> 00:54:51,057
Now, when Easy Breezy
was in his 20s

799
00:54:51,184 --> 00:54:54,064
and-and-and young and
good-looking, he could...

800
00:54:54,191 --> 00:54:57,296
He could break any horse
that you could throw at him.

801
00:54:57,424 --> 00:55:00,207
Back then,
he just had a way.

802
00:55:00,336 --> 00:55:03,472
Now he's into
his, uh, late 30s

803
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,097
and he takes a bad fall,
and it messes up his hip.

804
00:55:06,224 --> 00:55:08,528
He's not... He's not...
He's not crippled

805
00:55:08,656 --> 00:55:10,896
or anything like that, but...

806
00:55:11,024 --> 00:55:12,913
But he's got
spine problems

807
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,600
he never had before,
and he spends, uh...

808
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:20,559
more of his days in pain
than he ever did before.

809
00:55:20,688 --> 00:55:23,472
Jeepers, this sounds
like a good novel.

810
00:55:24,367 --> 00:55:26,128
Yeah, it's not bad.

811
00:55:27,088 --> 00:55:28,721
Where are you in it?

812
00:55:28,848 --> 00:55:30,961
Mm. About midway.

813
00:55:32,273 --> 00:55:35,345
What's happening
to Easy Breezy now?

814
00:55:35,473 --> 00:55:37,841
Uh, he's, um...
He...

815
00:55:39,185 --> 00:55:40,880
He's not the best
anymore.

816
00:55:42,096 --> 00:55:43,888
In fact,
far from it. And...

817
00:55:45,712 --> 00:55:49,489
he's coming to terms with what
it's like to be slightly more...

818
00:55:52,177 --> 00:55:53,648
use...

819
00:56:01,104 --> 00:56:05,201
Slightly more useless
each day.

820
00:56:20,047 --> 00:56:21,841
I-it's okay, Caleb.

821
00:56:21,967 --> 00:56:23,440
It's okay.

822
00:56:23,569 --> 00:56:25,904
It sounds like
a really sad book.

823
00:56:26,031 --> 00:56:27,856
Poor Easy Breezy.

824
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:30,321
I'm practically crying,
and I haven't even read it.

825
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:34,129
About 15 years,
you'll be living it.

826
00:56:34,256 --> 00:56:35,505
What?

827
00:56:38,735 --> 00:56:41,360
Nothing, pumpkin puss.
I'm just...

828
00:56:42,383 --> 00:56:43,760
I'm just teasing you.

829
00:56:45,073 --> 00:56:46,801
You know something? You...

830
00:56:48,144 --> 00:56:50,799
You might be right
about this book.

831
00:56:50,928 --> 00:56:54,001
I think it hits harder
than I gave it credit for.

832
00:56:55,761 --> 00:56:58,929
I don't like names
like "pumpkin puss,"

833
00:56:59,888 --> 00:57:01,775
but since you're upset,

834
00:57:01,905 --> 00:57:03,761
we'll talk about that
some other time.

835
00:57:56,144 --> 00:57:58,448
I'm only going as far
as Westwood Village.

836
00:57:58,575 --> 00:58:00,175
Hey, beggars
can't be choosers.

837
00:58:00,304 --> 00:58:01,168
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

838
00:58:20,944 --> 00:58:22,513
- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.

839
00:58:23,856 --> 00:58:25,585
- Good luck on your adventure.
- Thank you.

840
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:27,984
- Have a good time in Big Sur.
- Thank you so much.

841
00:58:28,111 --> 00:58:29,265
- Take care.
- You too.

842
00:59:32,945 --> 00:59:35,377
- Oh, hey.
- Hello.

843
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:37,967
How can I help you,
young lady?

844
00:59:38,095 --> 00:59:40,239
Oh.

845
00:59:40,367 --> 00:59:42,000
I'm here to pick up
a first edition

846
00:59:42,129 --> 00:59:44,561
of Thomas Hardy's <i>Tess</i>
<i>of the d'Urbervilles</i> I ordered.

847
00:59:44,688 --> 00:59:45,807
It's under Polanski.

848
00:59:45,935 --> 00:59:47,600
Yeah, you're talking books
there, kid.

849
00:59:47,728 --> 00:59:49,040
Oh, I know.
Isn't it wonderful?

850
00:59:49,167 --> 00:59:50,959
- Yeah. Oh, man.
- I just read it.

851
00:59:51,089 --> 00:59:53,328
- I'm getting it as a gift for my husband.
- Mm.

852
00:59:56,016 --> 00:59:58,415
- Rick Dalton?
- You bet.

853
00:59:58,544 --> 01:00:00,976
Jim Stacy. This is my show.
Welcome aboard.

854
01:00:01,104 --> 01:00:02,767
We're real glad
to have a pro like you

855
01:00:02,896 --> 01:00:04,239
playing the heavy
on the pilot.

856
01:00:04,368 --> 01:00:06,640
And I gotta tell you,
I came damn close

857
01:00:06,768 --> 01:00:09,328
to being in <i>The Fourteen</i>
<i>Fists of McCluskey.</i>

858
01:00:09,456 --> 01:00:10,577
- No kidding.
- Yeah.

859
01:00:10,703 --> 01:00:12,208
Let me tell you, I...

860
01:00:12,336 --> 01:00:14,448
I just got my part-part
by sheer luck.

861
01:00:14,575 --> 01:00:16,175
Up until two weeks
before shooting,

862
01:00:16,303 --> 01:00:17,872
Fabian was in the part.

863
01:00:18,001 --> 01:00:20,497
Then-then he breaks his shoulder
doing a <i>Virginian.</i>

864
01:00:20,625 --> 01:00:21,776
That's how I got it, so...

865
01:00:21,903 --> 01:00:22,768
Ah.

866
01:00:24,433 --> 01:00:27,888
Hey, Rick, I gotta ask you
something I heard about.

867
01:00:28,015 --> 01:00:29,169
Was it true
you almost got

868
01:00:29,295 --> 01:00:30,928
the McQueen part
in <i>The Great Escape?</i>

869
01:00:32,529 --> 01:00:35,408
- Hilts, isn't it?
- Captain Hilts, actually.

870
01:00:35,535 --> 01:00:37,263
- Seventeen escape attempts.
- Eighteen.

871
01:00:37,391 --> 01:00:39,887
Never had an audition.
Never had a meeting.

872
01:00:40,015 --> 01:00:41,264
Never met John Sturges.

873
01:00:41,392 --> 01:00:43,823
So, no, I don't think
you could say I...

874
01:00:43,952 --> 01:00:45,841
I almost got the part, but...

875
01:00:45,967 --> 01:00:48,176
- Tunnel man, engineer.
- Flier.

876
01:00:48,304 --> 01:00:50,479
I suppose what's called in
the American Army,

877
01:00:50,608 --> 01:00:52,400
a hotshot pilot.

878
01:00:52,528 --> 01:00:56,432
But the story goes,
for a brief moment,

879
01:00:56,561 --> 01:00:59,248
McQueen almost passed
on the movie,

880
01:00:59,376 --> 01:01:00,816
and during that
brief moment,

881
01:01:00,944 --> 01:01:03,056
I, apparently,
was on a list of four.

882
01:01:03,183 --> 01:01:04,240
You have other plans?

883
01:01:04,368 --> 01:01:05,520
I haven't seen Berlin yet

884
01:01:05,649 --> 01:01:07,056
from the ground
or from the air,

885
01:01:07,183 --> 01:01:09,296
and I plan on doing both
before the war's over.

886
01:01:09,424 --> 01:01:10,767
You and who?

887
01:01:10,895 --> 01:01:13,936
- Me and... Me and three Georges.
- Which three Georges?

888
01:01:14,063 --> 01:01:15,472
Peppard, Maharis and Chakiris.

889
01:01:15,601 --> 01:01:17,040
- Oh, man.
- Yeah.

890
01:01:17,168 --> 01:01:18,352
That's gotta hurt.

891
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,431
Yeah, well,
I didn't get it,

892
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:21,808
McQueen did it,

893
01:01:21,937 --> 01:01:24,209
and, frankly,
I never had a chance.

894
01:01:25,712 --> 01:01:28,304
Ten days isolation,
Hilts.

895
01:01:28,432 --> 01:01:29,457
Captain Hilts.

896
01:01:29,583 --> 01:01:31,280
Twenty days.

897
01:01:31,407 --> 01:01:32,304
Right.

898
01:01:33,584 --> 01:01:36,303
Oh, you'll still be here
when I get out?

899
01:01:37,615 --> 01:01:39,184
Cooler.

900
01:02:32,112 --> 01:02:34,736
- One, please.
- Seventy-five cents.

901
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:39,855
What if I'm in the movie?

902
01:02:39,984 --> 01:02:41,488
What do you mean?

903
01:02:41,615 --> 01:02:44,081
I mean, I'm in the movie.

904
01:02:44,207 --> 01:02:45,615
I'm Sharon Tate.

905
01:02:45,744 --> 01:02:48,080
- You're in this?
- Mm-hm.

906
01:02:48,208 --> 01:02:50,257
I play Miss Carlson, the klutz.

907
01:02:51,631 --> 01:02:52,624
That's me.

908
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:56,880
But that's the girl
from <i>Valley of the Dolls.</i>

909
01:02:58,449 --> 01:03:02,320
Well, that's me, the girl
from <i>Valley of the Dolls.</i>

910
01:03:02,448 --> 01:03:04,016
Really?

911
01:03:04,144 --> 01:03:05,360
Really.

912
01:03:07,695 --> 01:03:10,000
Hey, Rubin!
Come out here.

913
01:03:13,008 --> 01:03:15,729
This is the girl
from <i>Valley of the Dolls.</i>

914
01:03:15,855 --> 01:03:17,807
- Patty Duke?
- No, the other one.

915
01:03:17,936 --> 01:03:20,017
- The girl from <i>Peyton Place?</i>
- No, the other one.

916
01:03:20,143 --> 01:03:22,352
The one who ends up
doing dirty movies.

917
01:03:22,479 --> 01:03:25,263
- Oh.
- She's in this movie.

918
01:03:25,392 --> 01:03:26,896
- Oh.
- Sharon Tate.

919
01:03:27,024 --> 01:03:30,255
Well, welcome
to the Bruin, Miss Tate.

920
01:03:30,384 --> 01:03:31,918
Thank you for coming
to our theater.

921
01:03:32,048 --> 01:03:33,968
Would you like to come in
and see the show?

922
01:03:34,096 --> 01:03:34,928
Could I?

923
01:03:35,055 --> 01:03:36,207
By all means.

924
01:03:37,168 --> 01:03:38,065
Thank you.

925
01:03:39,951 --> 01:03:41,775
Hey, can I get
a picture?

926
01:03:41,903 --> 01:03:42,767
Oh, sure.

927
01:03:42,897 --> 01:03:43,760
Okay.

928
01:03:47,855 --> 01:03:50,095
You know, why don't you
stand over by the poster

929
01:03:50,225 --> 01:03:52,080
so people will know
who you are.

930
01:03:52,207 --> 01:03:54,351
Okay. Could you?

931
01:04:06,544 --> 01:04:07,952
Would you like
some refreshments?

932
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:10,609
- Oh, I'm fine. Thank you.
- Enjoy the show.

933
01:04:45,328 --> 01:04:47,568
<i>Can I ask
you a personal question?</i>

934
01:04:47,696 --> 01:04:49,839
- <i>I wish you would.</i>
- <i>How did a nice boy</i>

935
01:04:49,967 --> 01:04:52,687
<i>like you get involved
with a group like the Heads?</i>

936
01:04:52,816 --> 01:04:54,607
<i>I turned to them
after I was rejected</i>

937
01:04:54,734 --> 01:04:56,720
<i>by the Daughters
of the American Revolution.</i>

938
01:05:18,255 --> 01:05:19,951
<i>Very pleasant hotel here.</i>

939
01:05:21,136 --> 01:05:22,608
- <i>Mr. Helm?</i>
- <i>Yes?</i>

940
01:05:22,736 --> 01:05:23,760
<i>Oh!</i>

941
01:05:27,505 --> 01:05:28,880
<i>I'm Freya.</i>

942
01:05:29,009 --> 01:05:31,248
<i>Welcome to Denmark,
Mr. Helm.</i>

943
01:05:31,376 --> 01:05:34,928
<i>These are for you. Street maps,
places of interest.</i>

944
01:05:35,055 --> 01:05:36,335
<i>This is for you too.</i>

945
01:05:38,031 --> 01:05:39,695
- <i>What year was that?</i>
- <i>1949.</i>

946
01:05:39,824 --> 01:05:41,423
<i>That's a very good year.</i>

947
01:05:41,552 --> 01:05:43,184
<i>I'm here to
help any way I can.</i>

948
01:05:43,312 --> 01:05:44,144
<i>Very nice of you.</i>

949
01:05:44,272 --> 01:05:45,103
<i>Is there anything</i>

950
01:05:45,231 --> 01:05:46,448
<i>you'd like me to do?</i>

951
01:05:46,575 --> 01:05:48,463
- <i>Yes, a couple things.</i>
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

952
01:05:48,591 --> 01:05:51,760
<i>Would you mind getting off
my camera case, please?</i>

953
01:05:51,888 --> 01:05:53,456
- <i>Oh, I'm sorry.</i>
- <i>Oh, that's all right.</i>

954
01:05:53,584 --> 01:05:55,536
- <i>I'm so sorry.</i>
- <i>That's okay.</i>

955
01:05:55,662 --> 01:05:56,593
<i>I'm sorry about...</i>

956
01:05:57,999 --> 01:05:59,535
<i>Welcome to Denmark.</i>

957
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,639
<i>This is some kind of hotel
you've got here.</i>

958
01:06:12,847 --> 01:06:14,832
<i>Half a bottle
is better than none.</i>

959
01:06:24,047 --> 01:06:25,839
Morning, partner.

960
01:06:25,968 --> 01:06:28,241
Probably come
by to see you later.

961
01:07:00,655 --> 01:07:02,640
That's far enough,
jughead.

962
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:04,880
Name's not jughead.

963
01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:08,272
What you doing
around here, boy?

964
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:11,214
I'm thirsty. That's a saloon,
ain't it?

965
01:07:11,343 --> 01:07:14,286
Oh, yeah,
that's a saloon.

966
01:07:14,415 --> 01:07:16,849
- Only you can't come in.
- Mr. Gilbert.

967
01:07:18,704 --> 01:07:21,968
Don't let me stop you
from earning your money.

968
01:07:24,047 --> 01:07:25,999
I know how bored
and restless you get

969
01:07:26,128 --> 01:07:28,016
when you run out of tamales.

970
01:07:29,744 --> 01:07:31,856
But, Mr. Gilbert,
if I was you,

971
01:07:33,264 --> 01:07:35,663
I'd find out that
jughead's name.

972
01:07:37,071 --> 01:07:39,600
Allow me to introduce
the two of you.

973
01:07:41,263 --> 01:07:43,087
This here is Bob Gilbert.

974
01:07:44,207 --> 01:07:45,841
The Businessman?

975
01:07:45,967 --> 01:07:47,663
That's right.

976
01:07:47,791 --> 01:07:51,952
Business Bob Gilbert.
And who might he be, Caleb?

977
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:55,152
Well,
that's a fella by the name of Madrid.

978
01:07:55,984 --> 01:07:57,327
Johnny Madrid.

979
01:07:58,288 --> 01:08:00,112
Who's Johnny Madrid?

980
01:08:06,095 --> 01:08:07,695
He ain't from round here.

981
01:08:07,824 --> 01:08:09,775
No, really.

982
01:08:09,902 --> 01:08:10,928
Who is he, Caleb?

983
01:08:15,535 --> 01:08:17,200
Oh, you're about
to find out...

984
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:19,919
Businessman.

985
01:08:36,976 --> 01:08:39,761
Ready when you are,
Gilbert.

986
01:09:20,176 --> 01:09:22,160
Johnny Madrid.

987
01:09:26,863 --> 01:09:28,560
How long has it been?

988
01:09:28,687 --> 01:09:32,015
Since that time in
Juárez, about three years ago.

989
01:09:32,143 --> 01:09:35,344
Well, come on in
and have a drink.

990
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:37,743
Hell, in that case...

991
01:09:39,792 --> 01:09:41,968
buy you a drink, Caleb?

992
01:09:42,096 --> 01:09:43,121
Sure, Johnny.

993
01:09:44,495 --> 01:09:46,960
How about some mezcal?

994
01:09:47,088 --> 01:09:48,848
Like that time in Juárez.

995
01:09:50,447 --> 01:09:52,719
A lot of people
died that day.

996
01:09:52,847 --> 01:09:54,255
Yes, they did.

997
01:09:55,536 --> 01:09:58,032
But we had a good time.

998
01:09:58,159 --> 01:09:59,215
Didn't we?

999
01:09:59,343 --> 01:10:01,231
Yeah, we did.

1000
01:10:02,319 --> 01:10:03,855
After you, DeCoteau.

1001
01:10:05,264 --> 01:10:08,112
Pepe! Get your behind
behind that bar.

1002
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:09,871
I have a guest.

1003
01:10:25,327 --> 01:10:26,607
How's the beans?

1004
01:10:28,144 --> 01:10:29,456
I've had worse.

1005
01:10:31,632 --> 01:10:33,616
One dollar.

1006
01:10:36,462 --> 01:10:40,303
To my wife
and all my sweethearts.

1007
01:10:40,431 --> 01:10:42,415
May they never meet.

1008
01:10:48,623 --> 01:10:52,047
Señor Madrid, you care
to join me at my table

1009
01:10:52,175 --> 01:10:53,552
where I entertain
my guests?

1010
01:10:53,678 --> 01:10:56,111
I'd be
delighted, Monsieur DeCoteau.

1011
01:10:57,775 --> 01:10:59,632
Take the bottle
with you.

1012
01:11:01,263 --> 01:11:03,119
So, Johnny, ahem...

1013
01:11:04,942 --> 01:11:06,606
what brings you
to Arroyo del Oro?

1014
01:11:06,736 --> 01:11:09,520
Oh, you know me,
Caleb.

1015
01:11:09,647 --> 01:11:11,088
Money.

1016
01:11:12,335 --> 01:11:14,350
And who's paying
around here?

1017
01:11:14,479 --> 01:11:15,887
I hope you.

1018
01:11:16,015 --> 01:11:17,711
Huh.

1019
01:11:17,838 --> 01:11:20,110
And what have you
heard about me?

1020
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:22,000
I heard about
the Lancer Ranch.

1021
01:11:22,127 --> 01:11:24,207
All the cattle
you've appropriated.

1022
01:11:24,336 --> 01:11:25,648
A lot of land,
a lot of cows,

1023
01:11:25,775 --> 01:11:27,536
a lot of money,
no law to speak of,

1024
01:11:27,664 --> 01:11:29,008
and nothing
but an old man

1025
01:11:29,136 --> 01:11:31,920
and some Mexican ranch hands
to shoo you off.

1026
01:11:34,063 --> 01:11:36,176
Say, where's that
chili pepper

1027
01:11:36,304 --> 01:11:38,480
daughter of yours
with the fiddle?

1028
01:11:38,607 --> 01:11:40,303
She's asleep.

1029
01:11:40,431 --> 01:11:42,416
Wake her the heck up,
get her down here

1030
01:11:42,542 --> 01:11:45,903
with her fiddle and her bow,
and entertain my guest.

1031
01:11:48,624 --> 01:11:50,736
But, please, don't hurt her
this time.

1032
01:11:52,303 --> 01:11:53,711
I ain't gonna hurt her.

1033
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:57,391
I just want her
to play the fiddle.

1034
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:03,440
Line? "Go... Go fetch her
and tell her" what?

1035
01:12:03,568 --> 01:12:05,008
"Go fetch her and tell her

1036
01:12:05,135 --> 01:12:06,928
I'll give her a fat
$5 gold piece..."

1037
01:12:07,056 --> 01:12:08,432
Right. Go fetch her
and tell her

1038
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,320
I'll give her
a fat-fat $5 gold piece,

1039
01:12:10,447 --> 01:12:12,688
she play her little
chili pepper heart out, right?

1040
01:12:12,816 --> 01:12:14,096
- Right.
- Got it.

1041
01:12:20,047 --> 01:12:21,807
I ain't gonna hurt her.

1042
01:12:21,936 --> 01:12:24,079
I just want her
to play the fiddle.

1043
01:12:24,206 --> 01:12:25,488
Now, go fetch her
and tell her

1044
01:12:25,615 --> 01:12:27,087
I'll give her
a fat $5 gold piece,

1045
01:12:27,214 --> 01:12:30,127
she play her little
chili pepper heart out.

1046
01:12:30,254 --> 01:12:31,887
Go on.

1047
01:12:36,047 --> 01:12:37,647
So, Johnny,

1048
01:12:38,864 --> 01:12:40,398
what else you heard?

1049
01:12:40,527 --> 01:12:41,935
Hmm.

1050
01:12:42,063 --> 01:12:44,494
I heard you're pushing
Lancer pretty hard,

1051
01:12:44,623 --> 01:12:47,216
but Lancer's got money.

1052
01:12:48,334 --> 01:12:50,287
At some point,

1053
01:12:50,415 --> 01:12:52,591
he's gonna hire some guns

1054
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:54,671
and push back.

1055
01:13:01,456 --> 01:13:04,335
- Line. Line. Line, line, line.
- "Maybe he already has."

1056
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:08,496
Maybe... Goddamn it!

1057
01:13:08,624 --> 01:13:10,096
I fucked this
whole thing up, Sam.

1058
01:13:10,224 --> 01:13:11,376
Keep going!

1059
01:13:11,503 --> 01:13:12,719
- I fucked this up.
- Fight through it.

1060
01:13:12,846 --> 01:13:14,832
Can we just go back?
Please, can we just cut?

1061
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:16,239
Just say the fucking line!

1062
01:13:16,368 --> 01:13:17,743
No, really, Sam, please.

1063
01:13:17,872 --> 01:13:19,280
- "Maybe he already has."
- All right!

1064
01:13:19,406 --> 01:13:21,678
- "Maybe he already has!"
- All right, goddamn it!

1065
01:13:21,807 --> 01:13:22,735
All right, all right!

1066
01:13:22,864 --> 01:13:24,080
Woo!

1067
01:13:24,207 --> 01:13:26,160
You're a goddamn outlaw,
Rick. Come on, now.

1068
01:13:26,286 --> 01:13:27,728
Woo!

1069
01:13:27,855 --> 01:13:29,519
I got it. I got it.

1070
01:13:30,831 --> 01:13:32,143
Go back a bit, would you?

1071
01:13:32,271 --> 01:13:34,447
No, he's right. Back to one.

1072
01:13:34,574 --> 01:13:36,846
- Okay, now, use all that, baby.
- I'm gonna use it.

1073
01:13:36,975 --> 01:13:39,215
- Oh, I'm gonna use it.
- Put it all inside.

1074
01:13:39,343 --> 01:13:40,239
I'm gonna use it.

1075
01:13:42,255 --> 01:13:43,120
And...

1076
01:13:44,174 --> 01:13:45,487
action.

1077
01:13:48,270 --> 01:13:50,478
I heard you're pushing
Lancer pretty hard,

1078
01:13:50,608 --> 01:13:53,007
but Lancer's got money.

1079
01:13:54,127 --> 01:13:55,951
At some point,

1080
01:13:56,080 --> 01:14:00,176
he's gonna hire
some guns and push back.

1081
01:14:03,535 --> 01:14:06,158
Maybe he already has.

1082
01:14:06,287 --> 01:14:08,687
Maybe.

1083
01:14:11,407 --> 01:14:12,879
Maybe
I don't like Lancer.

1084
01:14:14,319 --> 01:14:16,047
Maybe I don't like
his boots.

1085
01:14:17,647 --> 01:14:19,246
Maybe I don't like the way

1086
01:14:19,375 --> 01:14:22,319
he uses those boots
to step on people.

1087
01:14:25,806 --> 01:14:27,310
What the fuck was that?!

1088
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:29,775
Jesus Christ!

1089
01:14:29,903 --> 01:14:31,055
Fuck!

1090
01:14:31,183 --> 01:14:33,294
Piece of shit.

1091
01:14:33,423 --> 01:14:35,310
Fucking damn it, Rick,
I swear to God.

1092
01:14:35,439 --> 01:14:37,552
Forgot your fucking lines,
embarrassed yourself

1093
01:14:37,678 --> 01:14:39,790
like that in front of all
those goddamn people!

1094
01:14:39,918 --> 01:14:42,766
You were drinking all night,
fucking drinking again,

1095
01:14:42,894 --> 01:14:45,647
eight goddamn fucking
whiskey sours.

1096
01:14:45,774 --> 01:14:48,719
Fucking bullshit.

1097
01:14:50,671 --> 01:14:52,848
You're a fucking
miserable drunk.

1098
01:14:52,976 --> 01:14:55,184
Not fucking remembering
your fucking lines.

1099
01:14:55,312 --> 01:14:57,167
I practiced them,
and now I don't look

1100
01:14:57,295 --> 01:14:58,863
like I goddamn practiced them!

1101
01:14:58,991 --> 01:15:01,040
You're sitting there
like a fucking baboon!

1102
01:15:03,054 --> 01:15:04,687
Fuck! Eight fucking
whiskey sours.

1103
01:15:04,815 --> 01:15:07,664
I couldn't stop at fucking
three or four. I have eight!

1104
01:15:07,792 --> 01:15:09,455
Why?! You're
a fucking alcoholic.

1105
01:15:09,584 --> 01:15:11,216
You fucking drink
too much, huh?

1106
01:15:11,342 --> 01:15:13,614
Every fucking night.
Every fucking night.

1107
01:15:13,744 --> 01:15:15,278
That's it,
that's fucking it!

1108
01:15:15,406 --> 01:15:16,622
That's fucking it.

1109
01:15:16,751 --> 01:15:18,895
You stop drinking right now,
all right?

1110
01:15:19,023 --> 01:15:20,240
Make a promise to yourself.

1111
01:15:20,367 --> 01:15:22,384
You're gonna stop
fucking drinking.

1112
01:15:22,511 --> 01:15:23,503
Oh, fuck it.

1113
01:15:27,055 --> 01:15:28,783
Damn it!

1114
01:15:28,910 --> 01:15:30,542
You show that
little fucking girl.

1115
01:15:30,672 --> 01:15:32,528
You're gonna show
that goddamn Jim Stacy.

1116
01:15:32,655 --> 01:15:34,959
You're gonna show them
on that goddamn fucking set

1117
01:15:35,087 --> 01:15:36,815
who the fuck
Rick Dalton is, all right?

1118
01:15:36,942 --> 01:15:38,958
Let me tell you something.

1119
01:15:39,087 --> 01:15:41,583
You don't get
these lines right,

1120
01:15:41,711 --> 01:15:44,496
I'm gonna blow
your fucking brains out tonight.

1121
01:15:44,623 --> 01:15:46,416
All right?
Your brains are gonna

1122
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:48,783
be splattered
all over your goddamn pool.

1123
01:15:48,912 --> 01:15:50,767
I mean it, motherfucker.

1124
01:15:50,895 --> 01:15:52,111
Get your shit together.

1125
01:16:55,630 --> 01:16:57,294
- Better? Okay.
- It's great.

1126
01:18:19,759 --> 01:18:20,719
Hey!

1127
01:18:21,743 --> 01:18:22,608
Hi.

1128
01:18:26,255 --> 01:18:27,599
Huh.

1129
01:18:27,727 --> 01:18:29,647
Woo!

1130
01:18:29,775 --> 01:18:30,927
Shit.

1131
01:18:37,422 --> 01:18:39,727
Fuck you, you fucking pig!

1132
01:18:39,854 --> 01:18:41,616
Oh, no.

1133
01:18:56,366 --> 01:18:57,486
Hello, hot stuff.

1134
01:18:57,616 --> 01:18:59,855
Looks like third time's
the charm.

1135
01:18:59,982 --> 01:19:01,775
Mm. How were those pickles?

1136
01:19:04,943 --> 01:19:06,702
Real good.

1137
01:19:06,831 --> 01:19:08,080
They were
the fancy kind.

1138
01:19:08,207 --> 01:19:09,648
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

1139
01:19:10,991 --> 01:19:12,175
Give me a lift?

1140
01:19:12,302 --> 01:19:13,487
Where are you going?

1141
01:19:14,895 --> 01:19:16,976
I'm going to Chatsworth.

1142
01:19:17,102 --> 01:19:18,959
Chatsworth?

1143
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:21,679
You hitch up and down
Burbank Boulevard all day

1144
01:19:21,806 --> 01:19:24,238
till someone says they'll
drive you to Chatsworth?

1145
01:19:24,367 --> 01:19:25,936
Tourists love to drive me.

1146
01:19:26,063 --> 01:19:28,174
I'm their favorite part
of their L.A. vacation.

1147
01:19:28,303 --> 01:19:31,599
They'll be telling stories
about the Hollywood hippie girl

1148
01:19:31,727 --> 01:19:33,583
that they gave a ride
to the movie ranch

1149
01:19:33,712 --> 01:19:35,246
for the rest of their lives.

1150
01:19:35,375 --> 01:19:36,719
Wait, Spahn Movie Ranch?

1151
01:19:38,030 --> 01:19:39,438
- Yeah.
- That's where you're going?

1152
01:19:39,566 --> 01:19:40,462
Spahn Movie Ranch?

1153
01:19:40,590 --> 01:19:41,583
Uh-huh.

1154
01:19:41,711 --> 01:19:42,864
Why you going there?

1155
01:19:43,630 --> 01:19:44,494
I live there.

1156
01:19:45,326 --> 01:19:47,726
- Alone?
- No.

1157
01:19:47,855 --> 01:19:49,103
Me and my friends.

1158
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:52,687
So you and a bunch
of friends like you

1159
01:19:52,814 --> 01:19:54,576
all live
at Spahn Movie Ranch?

1160
01:19:55,982 --> 01:19:56,847
Yeah.

1161
01:19:59,086 --> 01:20:00,592
Well, hop in.
I'll take you there.

1162
01:20:01,487 --> 01:20:02,639
Great!

1163
01:20:11,727 --> 01:20:13,805
Go down here and get on
the Hollywood Freeway.

1164
01:20:13,934 --> 01:20:15,311
I know where it is.

1165
01:20:17,263 --> 01:20:20,399
Are you some old cowboy guy
that used to make movies there?

1166
01:20:20,526 --> 01:20:21,966
Whoa!

1167
01:20:22,094 --> 01:20:23,535
What?

1168
01:20:23,662 --> 01:20:24,974
I'm just surprised
how accurate

1169
01:20:25,103 --> 01:20:26,766
that description
of me really is.

1170
01:20:26,894 --> 01:20:30,095
Some old cowboy guy that used
to shoot movies at Spahn Ranch.

1171
01:20:30,223 --> 01:20:33,551
So you used to make Westerns
at the ranch

1172
01:20:33,679 --> 01:20:35,952
back in the old-timey days?

1173
01:20:37,647 --> 01:20:40,111
Well, if by
"the old-timey days,"

1174
01:20:40,238 --> 01:20:43,406
you mean television
eight years ago, yeah.

1175
01:20:43,535 --> 01:20:44,815
Are you an actor?

1176
01:20:44,944 --> 01:20:46,480
No, I'm a stuntman.

1177
01:20:47,695 --> 01:20:49,295
You're a stuntman.

1178
01:20:50,415 --> 01:20:52,463
That's way better.

1179
01:20:52,591 --> 01:20:53,840
Why is that way better?

1180
01:20:54,991 --> 01:20:57,136
- Actors are phony.
- Oh.

1181
01:20:57,262 --> 01:20:59,247
They just say lines
that other people write

1182
01:20:59,375 --> 01:21:02,895
and pretend to murder people
on their stupid TV shows.

1183
01:21:03,022 --> 01:21:05,966
Meanwhile, real people are being
murdered every day in Vietnam.

1184
01:21:27,726 --> 01:21:29,519
Want me to suck your cock
while driving?

1185
01:21:38,063 --> 01:21:39,024
How old are you?

1186
01:21:40,271 --> 01:21:41,198
What?

1187
01:21:41,326 --> 01:21:42,926
How old are you?

1188
01:21:45,167 --> 01:21:46,062
Wow, man.

1189
01:21:47,503 --> 01:21:49,230
That's the first time
anybody asked that

1190
01:21:49,358 --> 01:21:50,574
in a long time.

1191
01:21:50,702 --> 01:21:52,111
What's the answer?

1192
01:21:54,574 --> 01:21:57,839
Okay. We gonna play
kiddie games?

1193
01:21:59,086 --> 01:22:01,551
Eighteen. Feel better?

1194
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:03,406
You got some ID,
you know,

1195
01:22:03,534 --> 01:22:05,613
like a driver's license
or something?

1196
01:22:05,743 --> 01:22:08,271
- Are you joking?
- No, I'm not.

1197
01:22:08,397 --> 01:22:11,726
I need to see something official
that verifies that you're 18,

1198
01:22:11,856 --> 01:22:14,511
which you don't have
because you're not.

1199
01:22:17,646 --> 01:22:20,047
Talk about a bring-down bummer,
dude.

1200
01:22:20,174 --> 01:22:21,200
That's you.

1201
01:22:21,327 --> 01:22:22,480
Yeah.

1202
01:22:26,863 --> 01:22:30,607
Obviously,
I'm not too young to fuck you.

1203
01:22:30,734 --> 01:22:32,814
But obviously,
you are too old to fuck me.

1204
01:22:34,287 --> 01:22:37,519
What I'm too old to do
is go to jail for poontang.

1205
01:22:39,407 --> 01:22:41,327
Prison's been trying to get me
all my life.

1206
01:22:41,454 --> 01:22:43,726
It ain't got me yet.
The day it does,

1207
01:22:43,855 --> 01:22:46,159
it won't be because of you.

1208
01:22:46,287 --> 01:22:47,376
No offense.

1209
01:22:50,222 --> 01:22:51,982
<i>You all right?</i>

1210
01:22:52,110 --> 01:22:54,382
She's just
fine, ain't you, shorty?

1211
01:22:54,511 --> 01:22:56,143
<i>I'm fine, Scott.</i>

1212
01:22:56,272 --> 01:22:57,678
<i>They haven't hurt you?</i>

1213
01:22:57,806 --> 01:22:59,534
Camera's ready, Mr. Dalton.

1214
01:23:01,166 --> 01:23:02,383
I'll be right out.

1215
01:23:03,726 --> 01:23:05,838
<i>The war.</i>

1216
01:23:05,967 --> 01:23:08,687
<i>I rode with
the British cavalry in Indi...</i>

1217
01:23:58,798 --> 01:24:01,327
Stand by, guys.
We're going in five.

1218
01:24:15,598 --> 01:24:17,998
Lancer's boys are here!

1219
01:24:18,126 --> 01:24:20,079
The old man here?

1220
01:24:20,206 --> 01:24:21,711
Nada.

1221
01:24:21,837 --> 01:24:23,246
But the son is.

1222
01:24:25,262 --> 01:24:27,149
Ah. Heh, heh.

1223
01:24:27,278 --> 01:24:28,687
The one from Boston.

1224
01:24:29,838 --> 01:24:30,734
I don't know.

1225
01:24:31,726 --> 01:24:33,038
You from Boston?

1226
01:24:33,166 --> 01:24:34,158
Yes.

1227
01:24:34,287 --> 01:24:35,695
It's the Boston one!

1228
01:24:37,424 --> 01:24:39,151
Keep the others outside.

1229
01:24:40,335 --> 01:24:41,615
Let the brother come in.

1230
01:24:43,184 --> 01:24:44,847
You heard him, Boston.

1231
01:24:53,455 --> 01:24:55,183
Come on in, Boston.

1232
01:24:56,430 --> 01:24:57,806
See, honey?

1233
01:24:57,935 --> 01:25:00,047
I told you they'd come
to parlay.

1234
01:25:01,614 --> 01:25:02,798
You all right,
honey?

1235
01:25:02,926 --> 01:25:05,806
Oh, she's just fine.

1236
01:25:05,935 --> 01:25:07,535
Ain't you, shorty?

1237
01:25:08,686 --> 01:25:10,542
I'm fine, Scott.

1238
01:25:10,671 --> 01:25:12,367
They haven't hurt you?

1239
01:25:12,494 --> 01:25:14,478
Not yet, I ain't.

1240
01:25:14,606 --> 01:25:16,335
But that can all change...

1241
01:25:17,455 --> 01:25:18,286
like that.

1242
01:25:21,965 --> 01:25:23,374
Say...

1243
01:25:23,502 --> 01:25:25,102
where'd you get that limp?

1244
01:25:26,511 --> 01:25:27,759
- From the war.
- Mm.

1245
01:25:29,006 --> 01:25:30,542
Which side?

1246
01:25:30,671 --> 01:25:33,742
I rode with the British cavalry
in India.

1247
01:25:33,871 --> 01:25:35,374
Mm.

1248
01:25:35,502 --> 01:25:37,902
What'd they call that outfit?

1249
01:25:38,029 --> 01:25:39,374
Bengal Lancers.

1250
01:25:43,149 --> 01:25:45,101
Now, now, now,
that is funny.

1251
01:25:45,230 --> 01:25:47,566
- That is funny.
- That's not so funny.

1252
01:25:47,694 --> 01:25:48,878
Don't you get it?

1253
01:25:49,006 --> 01:25:50,799
"Bengal Lancer"?

1254
01:25:50,925 --> 01:25:52,208
Hm?

1255
01:25:52,334 --> 01:25:53,614
Oh, yeah.

1256
01:25:53,742 --> 01:25:55,277
I get it now.

1257
01:25:55,407 --> 01:25:58,350
- That is kind of funny.
- It is.

1258
01:25:58,478 --> 01:26:01,710
You do know kidnapping
is a hanging offense.

1259
01:26:01,838 --> 01:26:04,206
So is blowing the heads
off little girls.

1260
01:26:05,678 --> 01:26:08,558
But they can only hang me
once, right?

1261
01:26:09,677 --> 01:26:10,575
So...

1262
01:26:12,142 --> 01:26:13,647
you come down here for a...

1263
01:26:13,774 --> 01:26:15,919
For a Boston social?

1264
01:26:16,046 --> 01:26:18,574
- Or we gonna talk price?
- How much?

1265
01:26:18,702 --> 01:26:22,509
I'd say $50,000 would buy me

1266
01:26:22,638 --> 01:26:25,967
a whole lot of chicken mole
in Mexico.

1267
01:26:26,093 --> 01:26:27,439
That's a lot of money.

1268
01:26:27,565 --> 01:26:29,807
Well, she's a lot
of little girl.

1269
01:26:29,933 --> 01:26:31,629
Or don't you agree?

1270
01:26:31,757 --> 01:26:33,006
I agree.

1271
01:26:34,894 --> 01:26:36,494
So, what's next?

1272
01:26:36,623 --> 01:26:38,894
Well, I'll send one of my boys
out to your ranch

1273
01:26:39,022 --> 01:26:41,199
to fill you in
on all the details, but, uh...

1274
01:26:42,926 --> 01:26:46,671
the one detail I'm gonna fill
you in on right now is this:

1275
01:26:47,982 --> 01:26:50,797
I don't want
no beaner bronco buster

1276
01:26:50,926 --> 01:26:52,462
handing me that $50,000.

1277
01:26:52,591 --> 01:26:55,599
I want the old man himself.

1278
01:26:55,727 --> 01:27:01,038
Murdoch Lancer
puts $50,000 in my lap...

1279
01:27:01,165 --> 01:27:04,206
or I heave this little pitcher
down a well!

1280
01:27:04,333 --> 01:27:06,734
You got that, Boston?

1281
01:27:06,863 --> 01:27:08,526
Huh?

1282
01:27:08,654 --> 01:27:09,997
Yeah.

1283
01:27:10,127 --> 01:27:12,303
All right, messenger boy.

1284
01:27:13,774 --> 01:27:15,246
Deliver my message.

1285
01:27:21,742 --> 01:27:25,038
Give me evil, sexy Hamlet.

1286
01:27:25,166 --> 01:27:26,894
Settle into it.

1287
01:27:27,021 --> 01:27:28,942
Enjoy it.

1288
01:27:29,071 --> 01:27:30,126
And cut!

1289
01:27:32,686 --> 01:27:33,806
Oh, boy.

1290
01:27:33,935 --> 01:27:35,439
I didn't hurt you there,
Marabella,

1291
01:27:35,566 --> 01:27:37,806
- with that throw, did I?
- No, no, no. I'm good.

1292
01:27:37,934 --> 01:27:39,374
I got pads on.

1293
01:27:39,502 --> 01:27:41,423
And I throw myself on the floor

1294
01:27:41,551 --> 01:27:44,399
just for fun,
even when I'm not getting paid.

1295
01:27:44,526 --> 01:27:45,743
The gate's clean.

1296
01:27:45,869 --> 01:27:48,175
Rick, Rick, Rick.

1297
01:27:48,302 --> 01:27:49,807
Put her there.

1298
01:27:49,935 --> 01:27:50,989
- That was it.
- Really?

1299
01:27:51,118 --> 01:27:52,494
That was absolutely fantastic.

1300
01:27:52,623 --> 01:27:53,839
- Oh, thank you.
- I loved it.

1301
01:27:53,967 --> 01:27:55,759
Your idea about
throwing the little girl

1302
01:27:55,886 --> 01:27:57,614
on the ground
just worked like a charm.

1303
01:27:57,743 --> 01:27:59,629
I figured you said Shakespeare,
so... Yeah.

1304
01:27:59,758 --> 01:28:00,814
That's right. That was...

1305
01:28:00,942 --> 01:28:02,928
That's what I mean
by "scare me."

1306
01:28:03,054 --> 01:28:05,326
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Evil Hamlet scares people.

1307
01:28:05,455 --> 01:28:07,758
- All right.
- Oh, and by the way...

1308
01:28:07,886 --> 01:28:09,870
- "Beaner bronco buster"?
- Yeah.

1309
01:28:09,998 --> 01:28:11,470
Where the hell
did that come from?

1310
01:28:11,599 --> 01:28:13,647
- I don't know. Improv.
- That was wonderful.

1311
01:28:13,774 --> 01:28:17,039
It was just... That was
a triple alliterative improv.

1312
01:28:17,165 --> 01:28:18,607
You don't hear those
too often.

1313
01:28:18,734 --> 01:28:20,494
- Okay? We're good.
- All right. We don't...?

1314
01:28:20,623 --> 01:28:22,127
- Don't need to go again?
- We're done.

1315
01:28:22,254 --> 01:28:23,534
- That was fantastic.
- All right.

1316
01:28:23,661 --> 01:28:25,454
Okay, moving on.
We're in the bordello.

1317
01:28:25,582 --> 01:28:26,927
Next setup!

1318
01:28:30,574 --> 01:28:34,159
That was the best acting
I've ever seen in my whole life.

1319
01:28:35,567 --> 01:28:36,398
Thank you.

1320
01:28:36,526 --> 01:28:37,646
Heh.

1321
01:28:54,127 --> 01:28:55,535
Rick fucking Dalton.

1322
01:29:08,431 --> 01:29:09,487
That's a car.

1323
01:29:10,735 --> 01:29:12,143
That's a strange car.

1324
01:29:13,453 --> 01:29:15,695
Snake, go see
who's outside.

1325
01:29:27,663 --> 01:29:29,007
So who is it?

1326
01:29:29,135 --> 01:29:30,895
I ain't for sure yet.

1327
01:29:31,023 --> 01:29:33,134
It's a bitchen yellow
Coupe de Ville.

1328
01:29:33,262 --> 01:29:35,279
Keep an eye on him.

1329
01:30:22,126 --> 01:30:23,599
Come on.

1330
01:30:39,534 --> 01:30:41,198
Where the hell
is everybody?

1331
01:30:50,127 --> 01:30:51,502
Hey, where's Gypsy?

1332
01:30:51,630 --> 01:30:53,263
She's down
by the chop shop.

1333
01:30:59,822 --> 01:31:01,837
- Hey!
- Hello!

1334
01:31:01,966 --> 01:31:04,878
Gypsy! I want you
to come meet my new friend.

1335
01:31:05,005 --> 01:31:07,213
Some old-looking
dude in a Hawaiian shirt

1336
01:31:07,342 --> 01:31:08,943
who just gave Pussycat
a ride home.

1337
01:31:09,070 --> 01:31:10,606
He just gave her a lift?

1338
01:31:10,734 --> 01:31:12,654
Nope. She's bringing him

1339
01:31:12,782 --> 01:31:14,574
down the ranch
to meet everybody.

1340
01:31:14,703 --> 01:31:17,166
Stay by the door.
Tell me if he starts coming this way.

1341
01:31:19,246 --> 01:31:21,455
- Welcome to our community.
- Thanks for having me.

1342
01:31:21,582 --> 01:31:23,917
Thank you for giving
our precious Pussy a ride home.

1343
01:31:24,045 --> 01:31:25,198
Think nothing of it.

1344
01:31:25,325 --> 01:31:26,638
We love Pussy.

1345
01:31:26,767 --> 01:31:28,207
Yes, we do.

1346
01:31:28,335 --> 01:31:30,382
Hey, where is everybody?
Where's the children?

1347
01:31:30,510 --> 01:31:32,941
Everybody left
for Santa Barbara.

1348
01:31:33,071 --> 01:31:34,478
Really?

1349
01:31:34,607 --> 01:31:36,526
Charlie's gone?
Everybody left?

1350
01:31:36,653 --> 01:31:39,533
Well, not "everybody" everybody,
but mostly everybody.

1351
01:31:42,382 --> 01:31:43,247
Drag.

1352
01:31:44,590 --> 01:31:47,087
I really wanted Cliff
to meet Charlie.

1353
01:31:47,214 --> 01:31:49,390
I think Charlie's
really gonna dig you.

1354
01:31:49,519 --> 01:31:51,726
- Angel, hold up.
- Well, maybe next time.

1355
01:31:51,854 --> 01:31:54,190
Yeah, you got to come back.

1356
01:31:54,319 --> 01:31:56,207
- Yeah?
- Yeah, sure.

1357
01:31:57,966 --> 01:32:00,845
So how's it all
comparing to your glory days?

1358
01:32:00,973 --> 01:32:02,479
Well, things have changed.

1359
01:32:05,742 --> 01:32:07,566
Not a bad mount, Connie.

1360
01:32:07,694 --> 01:32:09,933
I used to ride horses
every day back in Tennessee.

1361
01:32:10,062 --> 01:32:12,014
- Is that right?
- Every day?

1362
01:32:12,142 --> 01:32:13,967
Well, every week.

1363
01:32:14,094 --> 01:32:15,598
All right.

1364
01:32:15,726 --> 01:32:17,357
Ain't she just darling?

1365
01:32:20,847 --> 01:32:23,886
So, uh, my name is Lulu.

1366
01:32:24,014 --> 01:32:25,710
This is Tex.

1367
01:32:25,839 --> 01:32:28,014
We're gonna be leading you
on a great trail ride

1368
01:32:28,142 --> 01:32:30,414
through the beautiful
Santa Susana canyons.

1369
01:32:30,543 --> 01:32:33,615
Now, Curt, I hear you're already
an experienced rider.

1370
01:32:33,742 --> 01:32:35,917
- Yes.
- Yeah, so are you, Connie?

1371
01:32:36,046 --> 01:32:37,967
- Yes, I am.
- Hey, Tex? Come here.

1372
01:32:38,093 --> 01:32:40,494
So, uh, if you're both
experienced riders,

1373
01:32:40,622 --> 01:32:43,631
I guess we'll just make
this ride about having fun.

1374
01:32:43,758 --> 01:32:44,973
You ready to have some fun?

1375
01:32:45,101 --> 01:32:47,725
So Pussycat brought back
some guy with her.

1376
01:32:47,854 --> 01:32:49,741
Gypsy wants you
to go give him a look-see.

1377
01:32:49,869 --> 01:32:51,374
Yeah. Sure thing.

1378
01:33:09,454 --> 01:33:12,302
Oh, and here's someone
you absolutely have to meet.

1379
01:33:12,430 --> 01:33:14,638
One of our most favorite sons.

1380
01:33:14,766 --> 01:33:17,294
Tex, come on over here
and say hi to Cliff.

1381
01:33:17,422 --> 01:33:19,438
- Howdy, Cliff.
- Tex.

1382
01:33:19,566 --> 01:33:22,927
- What part of Texas you from?
- Oh, a place you never heard of.

1383
01:33:23,053 --> 01:33:23,886
Copeville.

1384
01:33:24,014 --> 01:33:26,127
Ah. Ever been to Houston?

1385
01:33:26,254 --> 01:33:27,662
Course I have.

1386
01:33:27,790 --> 01:33:30,158
Yeah, I spent two weeks once
on a Houston chain gang.

1387
01:33:30,286 --> 01:33:31,854
In August, no less.

1388
01:33:31,982 --> 01:33:34,286
That doesn't sound like
a whole lot of fun.

1389
01:33:34,414 --> 01:33:37,198
It's the last cop's jaw I ever
broke, I can tell you that.

1390
01:33:41,453 --> 01:33:42,317
Man...

1391
01:33:43,567 --> 01:33:45,935
Charlie's gonna dig you.

1392
01:33:46,062 --> 01:33:48,239
The Hawaiian guy
seems to be okay.

1393
01:33:48,366 --> 01:33:50,670
Everybody's talking
all friendly.

1394
01:33:50,798 --> 01:33:53,228
- Enjoy your day!
- Thank you.

1395
01:33:53,357 --> 01:33:56,398
Tex checked him out,
and now he's riding away.

1396
01:33:56,527 --> 01:33:58,733
If he comes this
way, let me know.

1397
01:34:01,294 --> 01:34:03,758
Hey, does George Spahn
still own this ranch?

1398
01:34:03,886 --> 01:34:06,318
Yeah, George
still owns it.

1399
01:34:06,445 --> 01:34:08,751
- Does he still live here?
- Yeah.

1400
01:34:08,877 --> 01:34:11,629
Does he still live
right there?

1401
01:34:11,757 --> 01:34:12,685
Yeah.

1402
01:34:12,814 --> 01:34:14,030
Is he here now?

1403
01:34:14,159 --> 01:34:15,695
I guess so.

1404
01:34:17,614 --> 01:34:20,109
So George gave you all
permission to be here?

1405
01:34:21,293 --> 01:34:22,414
Course he did.

1406
01:34:22,542 --> 01:34:24,047
And y'all take care of him?

1407
01:34:25,197 --> 01:34:27,214
Oh, we take care
of George.

1408
01:34:27,341 --> 01:34:28,397
We love George.

1409
01:34:30,702 --> 01:34:32,046
Well,
is there anything wrong

1410
01:34:32,174 --> 01:34:34,253
with me saying hello
to an old friend?

1411
01:34:34,381 --> 01:34:36,078
You can't see him
right now.

1412
01:34:36,205 --> 01:34:38,349
Why can't I see him
right now?

1413
01:34:39,886 --> 01:34:41,485
Because
he's napping.

1414
01:34:43,213 --> 01:34:45,134
This is his nap time.

1415
01:34:54,254 --> 01:34:56,718
Well, I think I'll just
go see for myself.

1416
01:34:58,030 --> 01:34:59,757
You never know.

1417
01:34:59,885 --> 01:35:01,485
He might have just woke up.

1418
01:35:10,670 --> 01:35:12,718
The old Hawaiian
guy's coming this way.

1419
01:35:13,902 --> 01:35:15,438
Okay, y'all, beat it.

1420
01:35:15,566 --> 01:35:16,847
I'll handle this guy.

1421
01:35:20,782 --> 01:35:21,742
Fine.

1422
01:36:05,518 --> 01:36:06,959
You the mama bear?

1423
01:36:08,686 --> 01:36:10,670
- Can I help you?
- I hope so.

1424
01:36:10,798 --> 01:36:13,644
I'm an old friend of George's.
Thought I'd stop and say hello.

1425
01:36:13,774 --> 01:36:15,086
That's very nice of you,

1426
01:36:15,212 --> 01:36:16,973
but you picked
the wrong time.

1427
01:36:17,102 --> 01:36:18,989
George is taking a nap
right now.

1428
01:36:19,118 --> 01:36:20,910
Oh, that is unfortunate.

1429
01:36:21,038 --> 01:36:22,255
Yes, it is.

1430
01:36:23,566 --> 01:36:25,870
- What's your name?
- Cliff Booth.

1431
01:36:25,998 --> 01:36:27,309
How do you know George?

1432
01:36:27,438 --> 01:36:29,709
I used to shoot Westerns
here at the ranch.

1433
01:36:29,838 --> 01:36:32,014
When was the last time
you saw George?

1434
01:36:32,141 --> 01:36:35,214
Oh, I'd say about...

1435
01:36:36,078 --> 01:36:37,359
eight years ago.

1436
01:36:38,862 --> 01:36:40,334
Oh. I'm sorry.

1437
01:36:40,463 --> 01:36:42,510
I didn't realize the two of you
were so close.

1438
01:36:42,638 --> 01:36:44,270
When he wakes up,

1439
01:36:44,399 --> 01:36:46,415
I'll let him know you came by.

1440
01:36:46,542 --> 01:36:48,942
I'd really like to say
a quick hello now

1441
01:36:49,069 --> 01:36:50,253
while I'm here.

1442
01:36:50,380 --> 01:36:51,822
Came a long ways.

1443
01:36:51,949 --> 01:36:54,574
Don't know when I'll get back
this way again.

1444
01:36:54,701 --> 01:36:57,997
Oh, I understand, but I'm
afraid that's impossible.

1445
01:36:58,125 --> 01:36:59,693
Impossible?

1446
01:36:59,821 --> 01:37:01,485
Why is that impossible?

1447
01:37:01,615 --> 01:37:03,758
Me and George like
to watch TV on Sunday night...

1448
01:37:03,887 --> 01:37:05,934
<i>F.B.I.</i> and <i>Bonanza.</i>
...but George finds it hard

1449
01:37:06,063 --> 01:37:07,438
to keep awake,
so I make him nap

1450
01:37:07,565 --> 01:37:09,614
so I don't get gypped out
of my TV time.

1451
01:37:09,741 --> 01:37:10,926
Ah.

1452
01:37:12,206 --> 01:37:16,078
Well, look, Red,
I'm coming in there.

1453
01:37:16,205 --> 01:37:20,045
With my own two eyes, I'm gonna
get a good look at George.

1454
01:37:20,782 --> 01:37:21,935
And this...

1455
01:37:23,853 --> 01:37:25,423
ain't stopping me.

1456
01:37:28,750 --> 01:37:29,614
Okay.

1457
01:37:30,767 --> 01:37:32,239
Suit yourself.

1458
01:38:54,765 --> 01:38:56,366
He back there?

1459
01:38:57,646 --> 01:38:59,533
Door at the end
of the hallway.

1460
01:39:00,782 --> 01:39:02,253
You might have to
shake him awake.

1461
01:39:02,382 --> 01:39:04,046
I fucked his brains out
this morning.

1462
01:39:09,102 --> 01:39:11,022
He may be tired.

1463
01:39:22,126 --> 01:39:23,726
Oh, Mr. Eight Years Ago?

1464
01:39:25,486 --> 01:39:26,893
George is blind,

1465
01:39:27,020 --> 01:39:29,453
so you'll probably
have to tell him who you are.

1466
01:39:53,900 --> 01:39:55,278
George, you awake?

1467
01:40:13,267 --> 01:40:14,164
George?

1468
01:40:16,466 --> 01:40:17,362
George?

1469
01:40:21,266 --> 01:40:22,131
George?

1470
01:40:24,882 --> 01:40:27,282
- George!
- Jesus.

1471
01:40:27,410 --> 01:40:29,811
- Hi, George.
- Wait a minute.

1472
01:40:29,939 --> 01:40:31,892
- What's going on?
- Everything's all right.

1473
01:40:32,019 --> 01:40:34,963
- I'm sorry to disturb you.
- Uh... Who are you?

1474
01:40:35,090 --> 01:40:36,883
It's Cliff Booth.

1475
01:40:37,011 --> 01:40:39,954
Just stopped in to say hello
and see how you're doing.

1476
01:40:40,082 --> 01:40:41,490
John Wilkes Booth?

1477
01:40:41,618 --> 01:40:42,900
No, Cliff Booth.

1478
01:40:45,139 --> 01:40:46,322
Who's that?

1479
01:40:46,450 --> 01:40:48,882
I used to shoot
<i>Bounty Law</i> here, George.

1480
01:40:49,010 --> 01:40:50,898
I was Rick Dalton's
stunt double.

1481
01:40:51,026 --> 01:40:53,683
- Who?
- Rick Dalton.

1482
01:40:53,810 --> 01:40:55,282
The Dalton Brothers?

1483
01:40:55,410 --> 01:40:56,947
No, Rick Dalton.

1484
01:40:58,419 --> 01:40:59,538
Who's that?

1485
01:40:59,666 --> 01:41:02,323
He was the star
of <i>Bounty Law.</i>

1486
01:41:02,450 --> 01:41:04,050
And who are you?

1487
01:41:04,178 --> 01:41:05,747
I was Rick's stunt double.

1488
01:41:06,898 --> 01:41:08,690
Rick who?

1489
01:41:08,819 --> 01:41:10,451
It don't matter, George.

1490
01:41:10,578 --> 01:41:13,491
We were colleagues
from the past, and I just wanted

1491
01:41:13,619 --> 01:41:15,378
to make sure
you're doing okay.

1492
01:41:15,507 --> 01:41:17,683
- I'm not doing okay.
- What's the matter?

1493
01:41:17,811 --> 01:41:19,411
Can't see shit.

1494
01:41:19,539 --> 01:41:21,203
Would you call that
"the matter"?

1495
01:41:21,330 --> 01:41:22,962
The man can't see shit,
okay?

1496
01:41:23,090 --> 01:41:25,426
I know. I'm sorry about that.
I was told.

1497
01:41:25,555 --> 01:41:28,019
Squeaky
sent me to bed.

1498
01:41:28,146 --> 01:41:30,290
Would that be
the little redhead out front?

1499
01:41:33,171 --> 01:41:35,507
What the fuck
is the matter with you?

1500
01:41:35,634 --> 01:41:37,010
First you wake me up,

1501
01:41:37,138 --> 01:41:39,410
and now you're pretending
that I didn't tell you

1502
01:41:39,539 --> 01:41:41,491
I was fucking blind!

1503
01:41:41,619 --> 01:41:44,530
How am I gonna know
what the hell color the head

1504
01:41:44,659 --> 01:41:47,250
of the girl is that's with me
all the time?

1505
01:41:47,378 --> 01:41:49,074
Oh, fair enough, George.

1506
01:41:52,465 --> 01:41:55,602
- No. Jesus Christ.
- Come on, George. All right.

1507
01:41:55,731 --> 01:41:58,131
Everyone
don't need a stuntman.

1508
01:42:05,458 --> 01:42:07,763
I don't know who you are...

1509
01:42:09,330 --> 01:42:11,284
but you touched me today.

1510
01:42:13,203 --> 01:42:15,602
You came to visit me.

1511
01:42:15,730 --> 01:42:17,681
Now I got to go back to sleep.

1512
01:42:20,147 --> 01:42:22,674
I got to watch
<i>F.B.I.</i> tonight.

1513
01:42:22,803 --> 01:42:24,243
I watch it with Squeaky.

1514
01:42:25,650 --> 01:42:28,979
She gets all pissed off
if I fall asleep.

1515
01:42:29,106 --> 01:42:31,795
What happens when she
gets pissed off, George?

1516
01:42:33,107 --> 01:42:34,098
Nothing.

1517
01:42:35,698 --> 01:42:37,938
I just don't like
to disappoint her.

1518
01:42:42,610 --> 01:42:46,162
So you gave all these hippies
permission to be here?

1519
01:42:51,506 --> 01:42:53,809
Just who the fuck are you?

1520
01:42:53,937 --> 01:42:55,729
I'm Cliff Booth.

1521
01:42:55,858 --> 01:42:57,011
I'm a stuntman.

1522
01:42:57,138 --> 01:42:59,217
We used to work together,
George.

1523
01:42:59,347 --> 01:43:01,938
And I just want
to make sure you're okay.

1524
01:43:02,067 --> 01:43:05,586
And that all these hippies
aren't taking advantage of you.

1525
01:43:05,714 --> 01:43:08,339
- Squeaky?
- Yeah.

1526
01:43:08,466 --> 01:43:10,643
She loves me.

1527
01:43:12,753 --> 01:43:14,770
So suck on that.

1528
01:43:22,897 --> 01:43:24,498
You take care, George.

1529
01:43:31,058 --> 01:43:32,627
Goddamn it.

1530
01:43:53,202 --> 01:43:54,612
You embarrassed me.

1531
01:43:55,571 --> 01:43:57,811
Yeah, sorry about that.

1532
01:44:00,179 --> 01:44:01,842
How'd your little talk
with George go?

1533
01:44:01,969 --> 01:44:02,929
Are we kidnapping him?

1534
01:44:03,057 --> 01:44:04,722
Not the word I'd use.

1535
01:44:04,850 --> 01:44:06,963
Now you've talked to him, you
believe everything's all right?

1536
01:44:07,090 --> 01:44:08,850
Not exactly.

1537
01:44:08,978 --> 01:44:10,801
This was a mistake.
You should leave.

1538
01:44:10,930 --> 01:44:12,595
Way ahead of you.

1539
01:44:16,563 --> 01:44:18,611
George isn't blind!

1540
01:44:18,738 --> 01:44:20,243
You're the blind one!

1541
01:45:03,250 --> 01:45:04,850
You do that?

1542
01:45:09,747 --> 01:45:11,699
You know, that's not my car.

1543
01:45:11,826 --> 01:45:13,811
That's my boss's car.

1544
01:45:13,939 --> 01:45:16,147
And if something were to happen
to my boss's car,

1545
01:45:16,274 --> 01:45:17,651
well, I'd get in trouble.

1546
01:45:35,219 --> 01:45:36,562
Fix it.

1547
01:45:36,690 --> 01:45:38,771
Fuck you.

1548
01:46:03,921 --> 01:46:06,035
- Leave him alone!
- He's a flower!

1549
01:46:06,163 --> 01:46:07,634
He's a flower, man.

1550
01:46:07,762 --> 01:46:10,001
He's just a flower.
He doesn't know better.

1551
01:46:10,130 --> 01:46:11,858
Ladies.

1552
01:46:17,651 --> 01:46:20,563
Come one step closer
and I will knock his teeth out.

1553
01:46:31,506 --> 01:46:33,074
Fix it.

1554
01:46:33,201 --> 01:46:35,377
Can I at least get a rag
to wipe my face first?

1555
01:46:35,505 --> 01:46:36,914
Nope.

1556
01:46:37,042 --> 01:46:38,642
Tire first.

1557
01:46:48,211 --> 01:46:50,161
- Sundance.
- Yeah.

1558
01:46:50,290 --> 01:46:53,650
Get on a horse, go get Tex
and get his ass down here.

1559
01:46:53,779 --> 01:46:54,643
Okay.

1560
01:47:03,570 --> 01:47:05,203
<i>I love you.</i>

1561
01:47:28,595 --> 01:47:30,930
Tex! Tex!

1562
01:47:31,059 --> 01:47:32,691
That Hawaiian guy's
back at the ranch

1563
01:47:32,819 --> 01:47:33,938
kicking Clem's face in.

1564
01:47:34,067 --> 01:47:35,762
Ah, son of a...

1565
01:47:35,890 --> 01:47:37,298
I'll take over for Tex.

1566
01:47:37,426 --> 01:47:39,027
Right this way.

1567
01:48:04,562 --> 01:48:06,323
Hyah! Hyah!

1568
01:48:27,219 --> 01:48:28,817
Clem, you all right?

1569
01:48:49,170 --> 01:48:50,738
How do?

1570
01:48:50,867 --> 01:48:54,003
What a day.
Shit, I almost lost my shit.

1571
01:49:40,146 --> 01:49:41,299
You, uh...

1572
01:49:41,426 --> 01:49:43,411
You want to come in
and watch my <i>F.B.I.?</i>

1573
01:49:43,538 --> 01:49:46,195
Why, I just figured we would.
I got a six-pack in the back.

1574
01:49:46,321 --> 01:49:47,538
Thought we'd order a pizza.

1575
01:49:47,665 --> 01:49:48,849
All right.

1576
01:49:48,978 --> 01:49:50,194
All right.

1577
01:50:10,481 --> 01:50:12,882
<i>Eighteen miles to Pendleton,
Willard.</i>

1578
01:50:13,010 --> 01:50:15,091
<i>Any kind of luck,
we'll be unloaded</i>

1579
01:50:15,219 --> 01:50:17,619
<i>and back at El Toro
before my kids go to bed.</i>

1580
01:50:22,258 --> 01:50:25,842
Hey, bought me
an acid-dipped cigarette today.

1581
01:50:25,970 --> 01:50:27,219
Oh, yeah?

1582
01:50:27,345 --> 01:50:29,298
You want to buy
a cigarette dipped in acid?

1583
01:50:29,425 --> 01:50:30,898
Yeah.

1584
01:50:31,026 --> 01:50:32,978
If I'm gonna trip,
I want to trip here, man.

1585
01:50:33,106 --> 01:50:35,090
Walk in the woods.
Not in my home.

1586
01:50:36,978 --> 01:50:38,098
Just gonna stash it here.

1587
01:50:38,226 --> 01:50:40,241
- Don't smoke it by mistake.
- Yeah.

1588
01:50:40,370 --> 01:50:43,089
You want to smoke some,
smoke some. Just save me some.

1589
01:50:43,217 --> 01:50:46,321
Nah, I don't need
to trip out on no acid.

1590
01:50:46,449 --> 01:50:48,211
My booze don't need no buddy.

1591
01:50:48,338 --> 01:50:49,489
Whoa! Oh!

1592
01:50:49,617 --> 01:50:51,379
Here I come. Here I come.

1593
01:50:53,329 --> 01:50:54,481
Mm.

1594
01:50:54,609 --> 01:50:56,561
<i>What's the trouble, corporal?</i>

1595
01:50:56,689 --> 01:50:58,162
<i>There's a truck tailing us,
sir.</i>

1596
01:51:01,297 --> 01:51:03,667
<i>It might be a farmer
in a hurry to get someplace.</i>

1597
01:51:05,457 --> 01:51:07,057
<i>Oh, fine.</i>

1598
01:51:07,187 --> 01:51:09,267
<i>Well,
take it as fast as you can.</i>

1599
01:51:09,393 --> 01:51:10,419
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1600
01:51:13,585 --> 01:51:14,866
That PCH?

1601
01:51:14,993 --> 01:51:17,843
Yeah, yeah. Malibu.

1602
01:51:17,969 --> 01:51:20,178
Puerco Canyon or some shit.
I don't know.

1603
01:51:25,778 --> 01:51:28,337
Uh-oh. Here comes trouble.

1604
01:51:31,377 --> 01:51:32,658
Boom! Ha, ha!

1605
01:51:32,786 --> 01:51:34,643
Oh, man. Right in the face.

1606
01:51:46,066 --> 01:51:47,570
That was a smooth leap.

1607
01:51:47,698 --> 01:51:48,562
Thank you.

1608
01:51:51,762 --> 01:51:54,483
Dead number two.

1609
01:52:00,945 --> 01:52:02,609
I like that shot.

1610
01:52:02,738 --> 01:52:05,138
That guy's a fucking prick.

1611
01:52:11,186 --> 01:52:13,043
Um, that's Bobby Hogan.
Good guy.

1612
01:52:22,130 --> 01:52:24,338
All right, get ready
for my big <i>F.B.I.</i> moment.

1613
01:52:24,466 --> 01:52:26,610

- <i>Good.</i>

"Michael Murtaugh."

1615
01:52:36,370 --> 01:52:38,130
- <i>The F.B.I.</i>
- Michael Murtaugh.

1616
01:52:38,258 --> 01:52:39,473
<i>Buongiorno,</i> Sergio.

1617
01:52:39,602 --> 01:52:41,298
Turn on Channel 7.

1618
01:52:41,426 --> 01:52:42,609
ABC.

1619
01:52:42,737 --> 01:52:44,307
<i>F.B.I.</i>

1620
01:52:44,434 --> 01:52:47,218
I'm watching your Nebraska Jim

- <i>Norman Fell.</i>
- Strong.

<i>Tonight's episode:</i>

"All the Streets Are Silent."

1628
01:53:04,978 --> 01:53:07,121
Except when Rick Dalton's
got a fucking shotgun,

1629
01:53:07,251 --> 01:53:09,042
- I'll tell you that.
- You're goddamn right.

1630
01:53:09,170 --> 01:53:10,130
<i>...new Ford Cortina.</i>

1631

Well, that looks delicious.

- Thank you.
- Enjoy, sir.

1633
01:53:33,778 --> 01:53:36,403
Mm-mm-mm-mm... Mmm.

1634

<i>After that Musso

1635
01:53:41,457 --> 01:53:43,601
<i>Marvin did provide Rick
job opportunities</i>

1636
01:53:43,730 --> 01:53:45,170
<i>in the Italian film industry.</i>

1637
01:53:45,297 --> 01:53:48,529
Rick Dalton,
Marvin Schwarz here. Hold on.

1638
01:53:48,657 --> 01:53:50,353
Hennessy X.O on the rocks.

1639
01:53:50,481 --> 01:53:51,889
Yes, Mr. Schwarz.

1640
01:53:52,018 --> 01:53:53,137
Two words.

1641
01:53:53,265 --> 01:53:55,602
Nebraska Jim, Sergio Corbucci.

1642
01:53:55,729 --> 01:53:57,554
N-Nebraska what?

1643
01:53:57,682 --> 01:53:58,643
Sergio who?

1644
01:53:58,770 --> 01:54:00,243
<i>Sergio Corbucci.</i>

1645
01:54:00,370 --> 01:54:01,777
A-and who's that?

1646
01:54:01,905 --> 01:54:03,249
The second-best director

1647
01:54:03,377 --> 01:54:05,393
of Spaghetti Westerns
in the whole wide world.

1648
01:54:05,522 --> 01:54:08,691
He's doing a new Western.
It's called <i>Nebraska Jim.</i>

1649
01:54:08,818 --> 01:54:11,154
And because of me,
he's considering you.

1650
01:54:11,281 --> 01:54:14,033
<i>Well, Rick got</i> Nebraska Jim.

1651
01:54:14,162 --> 01:54:16,434
<i>And Rick made a rather
compelling Nebraska Jim,</i>

1652
01:54:16,562 --> 01:54:18,833
<i>existing quite nicely
within Sergio Corbucci's</i>

1653
01:54:18,961 --> 01:54:21,201
<i>rogues gallery of antiheroes.</i>

1654
01:54:22,579 --> 01:54:24,082
<i>In Rome,
Rick loved the paparazzi</i>

1655
01:54:24,210 --> 01:54:25,681
<i>and the fuss
they made over him</i>

1656
01:54:25,809 --> 01:54:29,202
<i>and his</i> Nebraska Jim
<i>costar Daphna Ben-Cobo.</i>

1657
01:54:29,329 --> 01:54:32,691
All right there, paparazzos.
All right. Take it easy.

1658
01:54:32,817 --> 01:54:35,313
<i>He loved the food
so much that during his stay,</i>

1659
01:54:35,441 --> 01:54:37,201
<i>Rick gained
almost 15 pounds.</i>

1660
01:54:37,330 --> 01:54:40,081
<i>But he didn't love the
Italians' way of making movies.</i>

1661
01:54:40,210 --> 01:54:41,809
<i>In fact,
he thought the post-synced,</i>

1662
01:54:41,937 --> 01:54:43,729
<i>"every actor
speaks their own language,"</i>

1663
01:54:43,858 --> 01:54:45,426
<i>Tower of Babel shooting style</i>

1664
01:54:45,553 --> 01:54:48,082
<i>of European movies
was ridiculous.</i>

1665
01:54:48,211 --> 01:54:50,322
<i>While in Rome,
Marvin plugged Rick</i>

1666
01:54:50,450 --> 01:54:52,147
<i>into three other
Italian productions.</i>

1667
01:54:52,274 --> 01:54:53,744
<i>His second Western was</i>

1668
01:54:53,873 --> 01:54:55,890
Kill Me Quick, Ringo,

01:54:56,017 --> 01:54:57,425

<i>pseudonym for Giorgio Ferroni.</i>

1672
01:55:01,905 --> 01:55:04,241
<i>His third was
an Italian/Spanish coproduction</i>

1673
01:55:04,370 --> 01:55:06,002
<i>that paired him
with Telly Savalas,</i>

1674

01:56:04,401 --> 01:56:06,322
<i>Ultimately

<i>Italian sojourn

<i>although his swank
Roman apartment</i>

1684
01:56:10,257 --> 01:56:12,113
<i>ate up a big chunk
of his earnings.</i>

1685
01:56:13,905 --> 01:56:16,849
<i>So as Rick returns to Hollywood
via Pan Am,</i>

1686
01:56:16,978 --> 01:56:18,769
<i>he has four new movies
under his belt,</i>

1687
01:56:18,898 --> 01:56:20,274
<i>some money in his pocket,</i>

1688
01:56:20,402 --> 01:56:23,154
<i>and his brand-spanking-new
Italian wife,</i>

1689
01:56:23,281 --> 01:56:25,170
<i>starlet Francesca Cappucci.</i>

1690
01:56:27,665 --> 01:56:29,042
<i>Hurtling through the air</i>

1691
01:56:29,169 --> 01:56:31,634
<i>towards a new life
and uncertain future,</i>

1692
01:56:31,762 --> 01:56:34,771
<i>Rick was really not sure
about what lay ahead for him.</i>

1693
01:56:37,106 --> 01:56:39,249
<i>Way back in coach,</i>

1694
01:56:39,378 --> 01:56:41,554
<i>working on his
bottomless Bloody Mary,</i>

1695
01:56:41,682 --> 01:56:45,042
<i>Cliff Booth returned
to Los Angeles as well.</i>

1696
01:56:45,171 --> 01:56:46,546
<i>He kept Rick company</i>

1697
01:56:46,674 --> 01:56:49,522
<i>during his entire
six-month stay in Italy.</i>

1698
01:56:49,650 --> 01:56:52,786
<i>However,
as the two men return home,</i>

1699
01:56:52,913 --> 01:56:54,449
<i>they've come
to an understanding.</i>

1700
01:56:54,579 --> 01:56:55,826
Well, here it goes now.

1701
01:56:57,330 --> 01:56:58,258
With the, uh...

1702
01:56:59,698 --> 01:57:01,170
With the new wife, I, uh...

1703
01:57:02,577 --> 01:57:05,457
I just I can't afford you
anymore, Cliff.

1704
01:57:05,586 --> 01:57:08,818
You know? I can barely afford
my own house anymore.

1705
01:57:08,946 --> 01:57:11,506
So I think the plan
is to sell the house

1706
01:57:11,632 --> 01:57:15,249
and buy-buy a condo in-in-in
Toluca Lake, bank the money.

1707
01:57:15,377 --> 01:57:17,905
You know, live off it.
That type of thing.

1708
01:57:18,033 --> 01:57:20,784
Hopefully,
I score come next pilot season.

1709
01:57:20,913 --> 01:57:22,002
That's a good plan.

1710
01:57:22,129 --> 01:57:24,081
Yeah. You know,

1711
01:57:24,210 --> 01:57:26,482
by then, I'll know
if I have a career or not,

1712
01:57:26,611 --> 01:57:30,449
if I'm a solid Los Angeles
citizen like Eddie O'Brien says,

1713
01:57:30,576 --> 01:57:34,641
or if I'm one step closer
to going back to Missouri.

1714
01:57:34,769 --> 01:57:37,906
So when this whole
European journey is over,

1715
01:57:38,034 --> 01:57:39,058
I think we've, uh...

1716
01:57:40,659 --> 01:57:42,962
We've reached
the end of the trail, Cliff.

1717
01:57:53,649 --> 01:57:55,570
<i>So these last
four Italian flicks,</i>

1718
01:57:55,698 --> 01:57:57,075
<i>after nine years together,</i>

1719
01:57:57,202 --> 01:58:00,178
<i>would be Rick and Cliff's
final rodeo.</i>

1720
01:58:00,307 --> 01:58:02,898
<i>Cliff doesn't have a clue
what he's gonna do.</i>

1721
01:58:03,025 --> 01:58:05,042
<i>The only thing the two men
know of for sure:</i>

1722
01:58:05,170 --> 01:58:06,802
<i>Tonight,
Rick and Cliff will have</i>

1723
01:58:06,930 --> 01:58:08,689
<i>a good old-fashioned drunk.</i>

1724
01:58:08,818 --> 01:58:11,730
<i>Both men know, once the plane
touches down in El Segundo,</i>

1725
01:58:11,857 --> 01:58:14,033
<i>it'll be the end of an era
for both of them.</i>

Here it is, honey.

1731
01:59:20,177 --> 01:59:21,777
- You like it?
- I love it.

1732
01:59:32,849 --> 01:59:34,002
Where do you want it?

1733
01:59:38,386 --> 01:59:39,537
<i>Hello?</i>

1734

Oh, honey. How are you?

1738
01:59:52,720 --> 01:59:54,832
- Oh, my gosh, you're about to pop!
- I know!

1739
01:59:54,961 --> 01:59:56,497
- I know.
- Oh!

1740
01:59:56,625 --> 01:59:59,377
- And this is the nursery.
- Oh, my God, Sharon.

1741
01:59:59,506 --> 02:00:00,722
- It's perfect.
- Do you love it?

1742
02:00:00,850 --> 02:00:02,001
Little shoes!

1743
02:00:02,130 --> 02:00:03,282
I know.

1744
02:00:05,009 --> 02:00:06,578
I'm about to burst.

1745
02:00:06,706 --> 02:00:09,074
- I think you're gonna be a wonderful mother.
- Thank you.

1746
02:00:12,145 --> 02:00:12,978
Mm!

1747
02:00:25,010 --> 02:00:26,642
- Thanks, Gillian.
- Bye!

Yeah. They're fun.

1764
02:01:47,569 --> 02:01:49,202
- This place is always so busy.
- I know.

1765

- How's the wife?

- No, no, no.

<i>Sharon was experiencing</i>

1795
02:03:22,385 --> 02:03:24,817
No, it's not... It's not
because he just got it done.

1796
02:03:24,945 --> 02:03:26,129
He had just as much time

1797

as all the rest
of the goddamn directors.

1798
02:03:28,209 --> 02:03:30,225

02:09:12,850 --> 02:09:15,441
Next time you want to try that,
fix your fucking muffler.

1875
02:09:15,569 --> 02:09:17,458
Look, we're really sorry

1876

Look, chief,

All right. Just give me a moment
to turn it around.

1882
02:09:42,865 --> 02:09:44,529
Drive it backwards, numbnuts,

1883
02:09:44,657 --> 02:09:46,480

1884
02:09:46,609 --> 02:09:48,114
Okay. Okay. Stop yelling.

1885
02:09:48,241 --> 02:09:49,713
Hold your horses. We're leaving.

1886
02:09:53,456 --> 02:09:56,976

1887
02:09:57,105 --> 02:10:00,817
Hey, you come around here again,
I'm gonna call the fucking cops!

1888
02:10:06,288 --> 02:10:07,696
Dirty fucking hippies.

But he's seen us.
He's awake. He's alert.

Look!

1895
02:10:32,144 --> 02:10:34,512
- What did Charlie say?
- He said:

1896
02:10:34,640 --> 02:10:38,513
"Go to Terry's old house
and kill everybody in there."

1897
02:10:38,642 --> 02:10:42,160
And you heard him yourself.
He said, "Make it witchy."

1898
02:10:42,289 --> 02:10:45,168
Now, he either said that,

1899
02:10:45,296 --> 02:10:46,960
or I'm a liar.

1900
02:10:48,369 --> 02:10:51,345
Now, are any one of you
calling me a liar?

1901
02:10:52,369 --> 02:10:53,840
Hm?

1902
02:10:53,969 --> 02:10:55,728
How about you?

1903
02:10:55,856 --> 02:10:57,297
Are you calling me a liar?

1904
02:10:58,706 --> 02:11:00,657
No, of course not.

1905
02:11:00,785 --> 02:11:01,616
Good.

1906
02:11:01,745 --> 02:11:03,057
Hold it.

1907
02:11:03,184 --> 02:11:05,521
- Was that Rick Dalton?
- Who?

1908
02:11:05,649 --> 02:11:06,800
The guy from <i>Bounty Law.</i>

1909
02:11:06,927 --> 02:11:08,560
- Who, Jake Cahill?
- Yeah.

1910
02:11:08,689 --> 02:11:11,505
That guy in the robe
was Jake Cahill.

1911
02:11:11,633 --> 02:11:13,777
Wait a minute.
That was fucking Jake Cahill

1912
02:11:13,905 --> 02:11:15,282
that just yelled at me?

1913
02:11:15,409 --> 02:11:17,105
He was older,
but, yeah, I think so.

1914
02:11:17,233 --> 02:11:18,289
So who's this Rick guy?

1915
02:11:18,418 --> 02:11:20,146
Jesus Christ, Sadie,
get it together.

1916
02:11:20,273 --> 02:11:22,383
Rick Dalton played Jake Cahill
on a cowboy show

1917
02:11:22,512 --> 02:11:23,824
in the '50s called
<i>Bounty Law.</i>

1918
02:11:23,951 --> 02:11:25,200
Fuck you, Katie.

1919
02:11:25,329 --> 02:11:26,641
Sorry I don't know
the name

1920
02:11:26,768 --> 02:11:28,464
of every fascist on TV
in the '50s.

1921
02:11:28,592 --> 02:11:32,847
I can't believe that asshole
in the robe was Jake Cahill.

1922
02:11:32,976 --> 02:11:35,601
When I was a kid,
I had a <i>Bounty Law</i> lunch box.

1923
02:11:35,727 --> 02:11:37,905
That was my favorite
of all my lunch boxes.

1924
02:11:39,217 --> 02:11:41,810
Dig this!

1925
02:11:41,937 --> 02:11:43,729
When we've been having
our trip sessions,

1926
02:11:43,856 --> 02:11:46,289
I've been expanding
on this one idea in my head.

1927
02:11:46,417 --> 02:11:47,856
All right, dig it.

1928
02:11:47,985 --> 02:11:51,312
We all grew up watching TV,
you know what I mean?

1929
02:11:51,439 --> 02:11:52,911
And if you grew up watching TV,

1930
02:11:53,040 --> 02:11:54,833
that means you grew up
watching murder.

1931
02:11:54,960 --> 02:11:55,793
Mm-hm.

1932
02:11:55,921 --> 02:11:57,489
Every show on TV

1933
02:11:57,617 --> 02:12:00,240
that wasn't <i>I Love Lucy</i>
was about murder.

1934
02:12:00,368 --> 02:12:03,281
So my idea is...

1935
02:12:03,408 --> 02:12:05,680
we kill the people
who taught us to kill.

1936
02:12:07,664 --> 02:12:09,168
I mean,
where the fuck are we, man?

1937
02:12:09,298 --> 02:12:11,601
We are in fucking Hollywood,
man.

1938
02:12:11,730 --> 02:12:13,457
The people
an entire generation grew up

1939
02:12:13,584 --> 02:12:15,154
watching kill people
live here.

1940
02:12:15,281 --> 02:12:17,168
And they live
in pig-shit fucking luxury.

1941
02:12:17,297 --> 02:12:18,737
I say fuck them.

1942
02:12:18,864 --> 02:12:21,200
I say we cut their cocks off
and make them eat it.

1943
02:12:21,330 --> 02:12:23,410
That's a great idea, Sadie.

1944
02:12:25,745 --> 02:12:27,409
You two ready
to kill some piggies?

1945
02:12:36,496 --> 02:12:38,608
Wait a minute. Oh, shit.

1946
02:12:38,737 --> 02:12:41,008
Sorry, I forgot my knife
in the car.

1947
02:12:41,136 --> 02:12:42,864
Can I go...?
Can I go back and get it?

1948
02:12:43,953 --> 02:12:45,170
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

1949
02:12:45,297 --> 02:12:47,185
- Go on. Wait a minute.
- What?

1950
02:12:47,312 --> 02:12:49,329
I locked the car.
You'll need keys to get in.

1951
02:12:52,273 --> 02:12:53,361
Oh.

1952
02:12:53,488 --> 02:12:55,248
Right. Thank you.

1953
02:12:55,377 --> 02:12:57,904
- Okay. I'll be right back.
- Okay.

1954
02:12:58,032 --> 02:13:00,881
- Just hurry up.
- Yeah, just a little minute.

1955
02:13:10,769 --> 02:13:12,337
Oh, that fucking bitch!

1956
02:13:12,465 --> 02:13:13,521
Shh! Calm down.

1957
02:13:13,649 --> 02:13:15,250
There's a fucking house
right there.

1958
02:13:16,497 --> 02:13:17,457
What do we do now?

1959
02:13:17,585 --> 02:13:18,960
We do what we came to do.

1960
02:13:19,088 --> 02:13:21,744
And when we're done,
we split up and hitch home.

1961
02:13:21,872 --> 02:13:23,024
Any more questions?

1962
02:13:23,153 --> 02:13:24,338
Hm?

1963
02:13:26,193 --> 02:13:28,849
Okay, pig killers,
let's kill some piggies.

1964
02:13:28,977 --> 02:13:30,129
All right.

1965
02:13:42,320 --> 02:13:44,049
Oh, someone's hungry.

1966
02:13:52,464 --> 02:13:53,521
All right.

1967
02:13:55,376 --> 02:13:57,170
It's feeding time.

1968
02:14:00,049 --> 02:14:01,170
Brandy, couch.

1969
02:14:07,536 --> 02:14:08,849
And don't you mo...

1970
02:14:16,977 --> 02:14:18,832
Oh, man.

1971
02:14:21,456 --> 02:14:22,321
Uh...

1972
02:14:27,569 --> 02:14:29,522
The train
has left the station.

1973
02:14:36,177 --> 02:14:37,361
Bad idea.

1974
02:15:35,504 --> 02:15:36,945
Whoa.

1975
02:16:22,384 --> 02:16:25,391
You go around there,
see if there's a back entrance.

1976
02:16:25,520 --> 02:16:27,280
All right? Go.

1977
02:17:12,368 --> 02:17:13,616
Hey.

1978
02:17:16,528 --> 02:17:20,400
I am doing the best I can
under the circumstances.

1979
02:17:20,528 --> 02:17:22,608
Now, I do not want
to get into it tonight.

1980
02:17:31,665 --> 02:17:34,288
Uh... can I help you?

1981
02:17:40,400 --> 02:17:41,392
Shit.

1982
02:17:42,737 --> 02:17:44,496
How many other people
are here?

1983
02:17:44,624 --> 02:17:47,281
Oh, just the one sleeping
in the back there.

1984
02:17:48,816 --> 02:17:51,440
Go get him and bring him
into the living room.

1985
02:17:51,568 --> 02:17:52,656
What if he says no?

1986
02:17:52,785 --> 02:17:54,192
Don't take no for an answer.

1987
02:17:54,320 --> 02:17:56,753
You're the one with the knife.
Get him in here!

1988
02:17:58,961 --> 02:18:00,401
Hey.

1989
02:18:05,584 --> 02:18:07,312
You are real, right?

1990
02:18:07,441 --> 02:18:09,970
I'm as real as a doughnut,
motherfucker.

1991
02:18:19,440 --> 02:18:20,815
What the fuck?

1992
02:18:27,440 --> 02:18:28,687
Go to the living room.

1993
02:18:28,816 --> 02:18:30,416
What is going on, huh?

1994
02:18:35,280 --> 02:18:36,912
- Go!
- Okay. <i>Si, si.</i>

1995
02:18:39,184 --> 02:18:40,496
Who the fuck's that?

1996
02:18:40,624 --> 02:18:41,488
I don't know.

1997
02:18:42,831 --> 02:18:43,728
Francesca.

1998
02:18:50,256 --> 02:18:52,816
Oh. Uh...

1999
02:18:52,944 --> 02:18:54,608
What...?

2000
02:18:54,736 --> 02:18:56,367
Oh, I know you.

2001
02:18:56,496 --> 02:18:58,161
I know all three of you.

2002
02:18:59,408 --> 02:19:01,840
Yeah. Spahn Ranch.

2003
02:19:01,969 --> 02:19:04,529
Spahn Ranch. Yeah. Hoo!

2004
02:19:06,096 --> 02:19:09,776
I don't know your name,
but I remember that hair.

2005
02:19:09,905 --> 02:19:13,264
And you, I remember
your white little face.

2006
02:19:13,392 --> 02:19:15,216
And you were on a horsie.

2007
02:19:15,344 --> 02:19:17,008
Yeah.

2008
02:19:17,135 --> 02:19:20,079
Uh... You are...?

2009
02:19:20,208 --> 02:19:21,968
I'm the devil,

2010
02:19:22,095 --> 02:19:25,296
and I'm here to do
the devil's business.

2011
02:19:27,889 --> 02:19:31,377
Nah, it was dumber than that.
Something like... Rex.

2012
02:19:31,503 --> 02:19:33,425
- God, shoot him, Tex!
- Tex.

2013
02:19:36,785 --> 02:19:37,841
Fuck!

2014
02:19:52,336 --> 02:19:53,680
Son of a bitch!

2015
02:20:30,576 --> 02:20:31,441
Hey, you.

2016
02:20:34,383 --> 02:20:36,433
How dare you come into my house,
motherfucker!

2017
02:21:01,456 --> 02:21:03,055
Wow, man.

2018
02:21:54,065 --> 02:21:55,121
What the fuck?

2019
02:21:56,559 --> 02:21:58,032
Jesus Christ.

2020
02:23:11,663 --> 02:23:13,008
Holy shit.

2021
02:23:15,952 --> 02:23:18,639
Francesca! Francesca, honey!

2022
02:23:37,103 --> 02:23:38,991
<i>10,000 block, Cielo Drive.</i>

2023
02:23:39,120 --> 02:23:42,192
Around what time was it
when you confronted the intruder?

2024
02:23:42,319 --> 02:23:44,079
It was about midnight.

2025
02:23:44,208 --> 02:23:45,296
- Around midnight?
- Yeah.

2026
02:23:45,424 --> 02:23:46,927
How do you know
it was midnight?

2027
02:23:47,057 --> 02:23:50,160
Well, I was, uh...
I was in the kitchen.

2028
02:23:50,288 --> 02:23:53,361
You know, I was
making margaritas, and, uh...

2029
02:23:53,489 --> 02:23:55,119
I heard the sound
of a noisy muffler.

2030
02:23:55,247 --> 02:23:56,848
I looked up at the clock.

2031
02:23:56,976 --> 02:23:58,896
It said... The kitchen clock
said midnight.

2032
02:23:59,023 --> 02:24:00,495
Twelve o'clock exactly?

2033
02:24:00,624 --> 02:24:02,640
I mean,
it could have been 12:05.

2034
02:24:02,767 --> 02:24:05,007
- Something like that.
- And you didn't see them again

2035
02:24:05,137 --> 02:24:07,152
until the woman attacked you
in the pool.

2036
02:24:07,279 --> 02:24:09,136
No, no.

2037
02:24:09,264 --> 02:24:11,249
So,
what did these perpetrators do?

2038
02:24:11,377 --> 02:24:13,808
Perpetrators?
They were hippie assholes.

2039
02:24:13,936 --> 02:24:17,233
Two of them burst through
the front door there,

2040
02:24:17,360 --> 02:24:21,488
and the guy hippie
said he was the devil.

2041
02:24:21,617 --> 02:24:24,208
And he said, "I'm here to...

2042
02:24:24,336 --> 02:24:26,352
do some devil shit."

2043
02:24:26,479 --> 02:24:28,975
Or...
That's not verbatim, but...

2044
02:24:29,104 --> 02:24:31,761
- "Some devil shit"?
- Yeah, "devil shit."

2045
02:24:45,328 --> 02:24:47,281
And away we go.

2046
02:24:50,352 --> 02:24:52,367
Hey. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

2047
02:24:52,496 --> 02:24:54,064
What hospital you going to,
Cliff?

2048
02:24:54,192 --> 02:24:55,376
I'll meet you there, huh?

2049
02:24:55,503 --> 02:24:57,775
You don't want to meet me
in no hospital.

2050
02:24:57,903 --> 02:24:59,664
Why don't you go take care
of your lady.

2051
02:24:59,792 --> 02:25:02,544
Hey, she just took
five fucking sleeping pills.

2052
02:25:02,671 --> 02:25:04,368
She'll be asleep
till Columbus Day.

2053
02:25:04,495 --> 02:25:06,863
These guys will probably
have to come out here again

2054
02:25:06,992 --> 02:25:09,136
- just to wake her ass up.
- Hey, I'm not gonna die.

2055
02:25:09,264 --> 02:25:11,025
I may get a limp,
but I ain't gonna die.

2056
02:25:11,153 --> 02:25:13,008
- It's not my time yet, man.
- All right.

2057
02:25:13,135 --> 02:25:15,376
So no use waiting
in some waiting room.

2058
02:25:15,504 --> 02:25:18,447
Why don't you go lie naked
with that fine creature.

2059
02:25:18,575 --> 02:25:20,016
Come visit me tomorrow.

2060
02:25:20,144 --> 02:25:22,288
Bring bagels.

2061
02:25:22,416 --> 02:25:24,688
You want to do something for me,
check on Brandy.

2062
02:25:24,816 --> 02:25:26,575
She may be a little shook up
after that.

2063
02:25:26,704 --> 02:25:28,977
- She may want to sleep with you.
- Are you kidding me?

2064
02:25:29,104 --> 02:25:30,863
She's sleeping
with Francesca right now.

2065
02:25:30,993 --> 02:25:32,815
You might never get her back.
Ha, ha.

2066
02:25:32,943 --> 02:25:34,575
- We got to go.
- All right, then, Cliff.

2067
02:25:34,704 --> 02:25:36,976
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

2068
02:25:40,304 --> 02:25:41,712
Hey. Hey.

2069
02:25:45,519 --> 02:25:47,216
You're a good friend, Cliff.

2070
02:25:48,655 --> 02:25:49,776
I try.

2071
02:26:20,847 --> 02:26:21,713
Hello?

2072
02:26:23,599 --> 02:26:24,431
Hey.

2073
02:26:24,559 --> 02:26:25,551
I'm Jay Sebring.

2074
02:26:25,679 --> 02:26:27,631
I'm a friend of the Polanskis.

2075
02:26:27,759 --> 02:26:30,192
You're Rick Dalton,
right?

2076
02:26:30,320 --> 02:26:33,712
Yeah. Yeah. I'm Rick Dalton.

2077
02:26:33,840 --> 02:26:35,567
- Live next door.
- Oh, I know.

2078
02:26:35,696 --> 02:26:38,224
I tease Sharon that she lives
next door to Jake Cahill.

2079
02:26:38,352 --> 02:26:40,239
If she ever wants to put
a bounty on Roman,

2080
02:26:40,367 --> 02:26:41,935
she just has to go next door,
right?

2081
02:26:43,696 --> 02:26:45,327
No shit.

2082
02:26:45,456 --> 02:26:47,695
What the fuck happened?

2083
02:26:47,823 --> 02:26:50,255
Oh, th-these fucking
hippie weirdos,

2084
02:26:50,383 --> 02:26:52,528
they-they-they
broke into my house.

2085
02:26:52,655 --> 02:26:55,184
What do you mean, like,
trying to rob you?

2086
02:26:55,312 --> 02:26:57,040
We don't know what the fuck
they wanted.

2087
02:26:57,167 --> 02:26:58,799
Were they robbing me?
I don't know.

2088
02:26:58,928 --> 02:27:00,944
Were they freaking out
on some bummer trip?

2089
02:27:01,071 --> 02:27:04,209
Who knows? But they tried
to kill my wife and my buddy.

2090
02:27:04,335 --> 02:27:07,568
- Jesus Christ. Are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm fucking serious.

2091
02:27:07,697 --> 02:27:11,216
Now, my buddy and his dog
killed two of them, and then...

2092
02:27:11,345 --> 02:27:14,224
Well, shit.
I-I torched the last one.

2093
02:27:14,351 --> 02:27:16,016
- "Torched"?
- Yeah.

2094
02:27:16,143 --> 02:27:18,448
I burnt her ass to a crisp.

2095
02:27:18,575 --> 02:27:21,328
- How'd you do that?
- Well, believe it or not, I...

2096
02:27:21,457 --> 02:27:23,567
I got a flamethrower
in my toolshed.

2097
02:27:23,695 --> 02:27:26,097
Oh, from <i>The Fourteen Fists</i>
<i>of McCluskey.</i>

2098
02:27:26,224 --> 02:27:27,888
Yeah!

2099
02:27:28,017 --> 02:27:29,424
Yeah. Yeah.

2100
02:27:29,551 --> 02:27:31,023
That's... That's the one.

2101
02:27:31,151 --> 02:27:34,223
Yeah, it still works too.
Thank God.

2102
02:27:34,351 --> 02:27:35,600
Is everybody okay?

2103
02:27:35,728 --> 02:27:38,095
Well, the fucking hippies
aren't,

2104
02:27:38,224 --> 02:27:39,889
that's for goddamn sure.

2105
02:27:40,015 --> 02:27:41,486
Yeah. But I'm fine.

2106
02:27:41,615 --> 02:27:43,246
You know, my wife's fine.

2107
02:27:43,376 --> 02:27:45,967
We're just a little shook up,
is all.

2108
02:27:46,096 --> 02:27:49,391
- Oh, my God, that's terrifying.
- Yeah.

2109
02:27:49,519 --> 02:27:52,111
<i>Jay,
honey, is everything all right?</i>

2110
02:27:52,240 --> 02:27:54,128
Everything's okay now, honey.

2111
02:27:54,255 --> 02:27:56,880
But some hippies
broke into the house next door.

2112
02:27:57,008 --> 02:27:58,737
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

2113
02:27:58,863 --> 02:28:00,657
<i>Oh, that's terrifying.</i>

2114
02:28:00,784 --> 02:28:02,287
<i>Is everybody okay?</i>

2115
02:28:02,416 --> 02:28:06,128
I'm talking to your next-door
neighbor about it right now.

2116
02:28:06,256 --> 02:28:07,600
<i>Rick Dalton?</i>

2117
02:28:09,296 --> 02:28:11,568
Yeah, that's me. Heh.

2118
02:28:11,695 --> 02:28:13,967
<i>Oh. Well, hello, neighbor.</i>

2119
02:28:15,024 --> 02:28:16,688
<i>Is everybody okay?</i>

2120
02:28:16,816 --> 02:28:19,632
Yes, Sharon,
everybody's fine.

2121
02:28:19,761 --> 02:28:21,808
<i>Are you okay?</i>

2122
02:28:23,280 --> 02:28:25,712
Well, yes, I am.
Thank you for asking that.

2123
02:28:25,840 --> 02:28:28,112
<i>Rick,
would you like to come up to the house</i>

2124
02:28:28,239 --> 02:28:30,608
<i>for a drink
and meet my other friends?</i>

2125
02:28:36,495 --> 02:28:39,534
Yeah, sure.
Thank you.

2126
02:28:39,663 --> 02:28:42,159
<i>Oh, hooray! Great.
I'll buzz you up.</i>

2127
02:28:53,391 --> 02:28:54,256
Come on.

2128
02:28:57,872 --> 02:28:59,920
- Hey, nice to meet you, huh?
- Yeah.

2129
02:29:00,047 --> 02:29:01,423
- Jay Sebring.
- Hey, pleasure.

2130
02:29:01,551 --> 02:29:02,544
- Yeah.
- Pleasure, Jay.

2131
02:29:02,671 --> 02:29:03,759
Pleasure's all mine.

2132
02:29:03,887 --> 02:29:05,614
Sounds like you had
a hell of a night.

2133
02:32:16,464 --> 02:32:18,128
Hi. This is Rick Dalton,

2134
02:32:18,255 --> 02:32:20,654
better known as bounty hunter
Jake Cahill,

2135
02:32:20,783 --> 02:32:24,046
speaking on behalf
of Red Apple cigarettes.

2136
02:32:24,174 --> 02:32:27,151
Now, I smoke Red Apples.
Been smoking them for years.

2137
02:32:27,279 --> 02:32:29,519
But since the Red Apple
tobacco company's

2138
02:32:29,648 --> 02:32:32,015
been around since 1862,

2139
02:32:32,144 --> 02:32:35,216
<i>you'll see Jake Cahill
smoke Red Apple too.</i>

2140
02:32:35,344 --> 02:32:38,319
<i>Now, back in Jake's day,
Red Apple came in a pouch,</i>

2141
02:32:38,446 --> 02:32:40,206
<i>and he had to roll his own.</i>

2142
02:32:40,336 --> 02:32:43,120
But today, Red Apple
comes factory-rolled.

2143
02:32:43,247 --> 02:32:46,703
For the best drag
with the best tobacco flavor,

2144
02:32:46,831 --> 02:32:48,654
with less burn on your throat

2145
02:32:48,783 --> 02:32:51,119
than any other
non-filtered cigarette.

2146
02:32:57,232 --> 02:32:58,480
Mm!

2147
02:33:00,175 --> 02:33:02,608
Now, that's the way
a cigarette should taste.

2148
02:33:02,736 --> 02:33:03,568
Hm.

2149
02:33:03,696 --> 02:33:06,415
Better drag, more flavor,

2150
02:33:06,542 --> 02:33:07,887
less throat burn.

2151
02:33:10,191 --> 02:33:12,687
That's the Red Apple way.

2152
02:33:12,817 --> 02:33:16,336
So look for this life-size
standee of me, Jake Cahill,

2153
02:33:16,464 --> 02:33:19,888
wherever fine Red Apple tobacco
products are sold.

2154
02:33:20,016 --> 02:33:23,087
Take a bite
and feel all right.

2155
02:33:23,214 --> 02:33:26,382
Take a bite of
a Red Apple.

2156
02:33:26,511 --> 02:33:27,855
Tell them Jake sent you.

2157
02:33:30,863 --> 02:33:32,015
And cut.

2158
02:33:32,143 --> 02:33:33,871
This cigarette tastes like
fucking shit.

2159
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:35,695
And, by the way,
who chose this photo?

2160
02:33:35,824 --> 02:33:37,198
I have a double chin.
All right?

2161
02:33:37,327 --> 02:33:38,575
Nobody notices that crap?

2162
02:33:44,191 --> 02:33:49,191
