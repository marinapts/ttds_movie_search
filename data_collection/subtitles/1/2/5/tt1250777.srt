1
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,825
Guardian of the Universe. Protector against the forces of evil

2
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:31,275
He can catch a bullet,
faster than a speeding train.

3
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,674
He leaps tall buildings in a single bound.

4
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,009
Up in the sky.
Is it a bird, is it a plane?

5
00:00:36,105 --> 00:00:39,342
...Mailman by day,
superhero by night.

6
00:00:39,436 --> 00:00:41,982
He protects New York
from the forces of evil.

7
00:00:42,077 --> 00:00:49,041
... The World has been protected by
extraordinary men and women who have
dedicated themselves to fighting crime.

8
00:00:49,137 --> 00:00:53,503
He has powers far beyond the capabilities of mere earthlings.

9
00:01:03,974 --> 00:01:06,117
I always wondered why nobody did it
before me

10
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:12,282
I mean, all those comic
books. Movies. TV shows...

11
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,161
You'd think that one eccentric loner
would have made himself a costume.

12
00:01:17,936 --> 00:01:21,239
Is everyday life really so
exciting,

13
00:01:21,227 --> 00:01:25,299
are schools and offices so thrilling, that Im the only one who ever fantasized about this?

14
00:01:25,974 --> 00:01:29,274
C'mon. Be honest with yourself.

15
00:01:29,343 --> 00:01:31,052
At some point in our lives,

16
00:01:31,106 --> 00:01:34,243
we all wanted to be a super hero.

17
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,117
That's not me, by the way.

18
00:01:50,223 --> 00:01:53,256
That's some Armenian guy with a history of
mental health problems.

19
00:01:54,445 --> 00:01:55,468
Who am I?

20
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,986
I'm "Kick-Ass"

21
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:10,911
That's me. Back before any of this
crazy shit happened.

22
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:14,984
Guess I was the last person you'd expect to become a superhero

23
00:02:16,155 --> 00:02:18,352
Not saying there was anything wrong
with me.

24
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:21,148
But there's not nothing special either

25
00:02:21,181 --> 00:02:23,927
I wasn't into sports

26
00:02:24,926 --> 00:02:26,984
I wasn't a mathlete...
or a hard-core gamer...

27
00:02:28,726 --> 00:02:31,525
I didn't have a piercing,
or an eating disorder,

28
00:02:32,044 --> 00:02:33,796
or three thousand
friends on MySpace.

29
00:02:34,394 --> 00:02:37,443
My only superpower was being invisible to girls

30
00:02:38,715 --> 00:02:41,459
But out of my friends, man, I wasn't even the funny one.

31
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:45,342
Like most people my age, I just
existed.

32
00:02:55,452 --> 00:02:56,663
Good morning, class

33
00:02:56,953 --> 00:03:00,456
Please open your books to act II, scene II

34
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:04,496
Kick in my bedroom door, you'ld
probably find me watching TV.

35
00:03:05,461 --> 00:03:07,199
Or talking to my friend Todd on Skype.

36
00:03:07,334 --> 00:03:09,199
You watching Family Guy?
Nope.

37
00:03:09,695 --> 00:03:10,805
Me neither.

38
00:03:10,805 --> 00:03:13,594
try "hardnipplesweat.com......It's good

39
00:03:16,886 --> 00:03:19,370
Or "jerking off".
Mostly to my English teacher

40
00:03:21,022 --> 00:03:25,953
David Lizewski, don't think I
haven't noticed you looking at my tits?

41
00:03:27,897 --> 00:03:31,483
Oh!...I want your
hand all over me...Dave...please

42
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:38,047
Sure a lot of what got me through the average school day
was making deposits in the wack-off warehouse for later

43
00:03:39,754 --> 00:03:42,374
Though, to be honest I didn't take much to set me off.

44
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:48,927
I swear, when hormones balance out
shares in Kleenex are gonna take a dive, man.

45
00:03:52,555 --> 00:03:53,670
Dave Lizewski

46
00:03:54,143 --> 00:03:55,868
Shouldn't you be looking at Hamlet right now?

47
00:03:56,368 --> 00:03:57,310
Yes, Mrs. Zane

48
00:03:59,932 --> 00:04:00,646
Sorry

49
00:04:02,483 --> 00:04:03,481
But don't make me wrong

50
00:04:03,482 --> 00:04:05,350
I like girls in my own age, too.

51
00:04:06,545 --> 00:04:08,378
Especially Katie Deauxma.

52
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:09,306
Hey gorgeous!

53
00:04:10,162 --> 00:04:10,984
Hey!

54
00:04:15,104 --> 00:04:16,164
Oh, No

55
00:04:16,534 --> 00:04:18,453
you meant - Erika

56
00:04:18,985 --> 00:04:20,766
I know. I
knew that.

57
00:04:21,043 --> 00:04:22,126
I was just kidding.

58
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,558
O.K., cool.

59
00:04:25,422 --> 00:04:26,210
oh, my God

60
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,046
Hey , look I'm Todd's mom.

61
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,103
Oh, that's funny, this is your dad

62
00:04:37,184 --> 00:04:38,671
No That's still my mom, actually

63
00:04:41,612 --> 00:04:42,600
what the fuck?

64
00:04:42,931 --> 00:04:44,665
I was just a regular guy.

65
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:49,400
No radioactive spiders.
No refugee status from a doomed alien world.

66
00:04:49,401 --> 00:04:54,621
You know what? Todd said they do still
make Count Chocula. They just dont
sell it in the store anymore.

67
00:04:57,019 --> 00:04:59,437
My mother was killed by an aneurism
in the kitchen,

68
00:04:59,438 --> 00:05:01,725
as opposed to a
gunman in an alley.

69
00:05:01,726 --> 00:05:06,270
So if you were hoping for any...
I will avenge you, mother!

70
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,170
...You're outta luck.

71
00:05:07,581 --> 00:05:09,661
In fact, in the eighteen months
since my mother died,

72
00:05:09,661 --> 00:05:13,510
the only epiphany I had was realizing that,
life just goes on.

73
00:05:13,511 --> 00:05:15,061
Did they change the bee's face?

74
00:05:16,675 --> 00:05:17,677
No

75
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:27,517
How come nobody's ever tried to be
a superhero?

76
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:31,047
well, I dunno. Probably
'cause it's fucking impossible, dip-shit.

77
00:05:31,048 --> 00:05:33,947
What, putting on a mask and helping
people? How is that impossible?

78
00:05:33,948 --> 00:05:36,148
That's not a superhero, though. It has to have Super

79
00:05:36,148 --> 00:05:39,805
Super is like, being stronger than everybody and flying and shit. That's just hero.

80
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,452
No, It's not even hero, its just fuckin'
psycho.

81
00:05:43,335 --> 00:05:44,775
Hello? Bruce Wayne?

82
00:05:44,776 --> 00:05:45,986
He didn't have any powers.

83
00:05:45,987 --> 00:05:48,481
Yeah, but he had all expensive shit
that doesn't exist.

84
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,664
I thought you meant, like how come
no one does it in real life.

85
00:05:50,698 --> 00:05:52,160
Yeah, Todd, that's what I meant.

86
00:05:52,161 --> 00:05:55,963
Dude if anybody did it in real life
they'd get their ass kicked.

87
00:05:55,963 --> 00:05:56,689
They'd be dead in like, a day.
...A day.

88
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,497
O.K., I'm not saying they should do it.

89
00:05:58,498 --> 00:06:00,267
I just cant figure out why nobody
does.

90
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:04,230
Seriously, out of all the millions of people who love superheroes

91
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:05,913
you'd think
one would give it a try.

92
00:06:07,268 --> 00:06:09,303
Jesus, guys. Doesn't it bug you?

93
00:06:09,304 --> 00:06:12,445
Why do thousands of people wanna be Paris
Hilton, and nobody wants to be Spider-Man?

94
00:06:12,446 --> 00:06:14,910
Yeah, what's with that? She has,
like, no tits at all.

95
00:06:15,361 --> 00:06:17,541
Maybe it's the porn tape.
He doesn't have a porn tape.

96
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:19,266
You never saw One Night in
Spider-Man?

97
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,464
Guess who?

98
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:30,064
Is it just me, or do you feel kinda
sorry for Chris D'Amico?

99
00:06:30,065 --> 00:06:33,061
Yeah, must be terrible to have a
rich dad and everything you want.

100
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:36,205
I wish you hadn't said anything. 'Cause I feel like I'm gonna start crying.

101
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,082
No, the fact that it

102
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,853
Yeh, but he's always on his own.

103
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,477
We should, like, talk to him.

104
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:45,146
See if he wants to hang with us.

105
00:06:45,147 --> 00:06:46,893
.... I'm not saying that we should talk to him, but

106
00:06:46,894 --> 00:06:50,959
Think about it. C'mon itd be awesome! If
he was our friend, no one would
ever fuck with us again!

107
00:06:51,172 --> 00:06:52,621
Go on then, Todd.

108
00:06:52,623 --> 00:06:54,256
No, no -
What you mean? Want me to talk to him? -

109
00:06:54,641 --> 00:06:57,108
Nuh-uh. Dave should go.
Dave should go.

110
00:06:57,494 --> 00:06:59,416
Why?
Dave you should totally go.
Go.

111
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,423
Do not be afraid Dave -

112
00:07:01,424 --> 00:07:02,424
You are a pussy

113
00:07:09,815 --> 00:07:10,987
Fuck off.

114
00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:18,293
Wanna go over there? -
Yeah -.............

115
00:07:18,293 --> 00:07:20,428
You think I just shat my pants or what?....

116
00:07:21,716 --> 00:07:22,649
Yeah.

117
00:07:23,137 --> 00:07:26,003
Yeah I would just klick his ass

118
00:07:26,005 --> 00:07:27,987
When did you ever kick anyone's ass?

119
00:07:27,988 --> 00:07:30,294
Whatever, man I would've just gone for his knees....

120
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:31,776
You are not making sense.

121
00:07:31,865 --> 00:07:38,857
What I'm saying is that in the Joker portion when he got in "Evaran" when he vowed to penetrate
the Joker's force field leaving him totally vulnerable

122
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:40,314
Pussy Patrol!

123
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:41,874
Phones. Money.

124
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,227
Hey guys, not again
Come on

125
00:07:45,688 --> 00:07:48,137
Phone.
I don't have one! Somebody else
jacked it last week!

126
00:07:48,576 --> 00:07:49,750
Pussy

127
00:07:49,751 --> 00:07:51,896
Gimme the bag
Its just comics.

128
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:53,680
Yo! You wanna get cut?

129
00:08:03,987 --> 00:08:06,148
Look at this asshole, just watching

130
00:08:10,522 --> 00:08:13,325
Come on, be honest with yourself

131
00:08:13,325 --> 00:08:15,915
would you do anything differently

132
00:08:18,054 --> 00:08:20,595
We see someone in trouble
and we wish we can help

133
00:08:21,105 --> 00:08:22,176
But we don't

134
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:30,340
The world I lived in,
heroes only exist in comic books

135
00:08:31,863 --> 00:08:35,608
But I guess that would have been OK if bad guys were make believe too.

136
00:08:36,852 --> 00:08:38,174
But they are not

137
00:08:39,413 --> 00:08:42,331
Frankie. I swear I'm not making this up.

138
00:08:42,427 --> 00:08:49,025
This fucking guy... Comes outta nowhere
kicks our asses, steals all the coke

139
00:08:49,025 --> 00:08:50,925
This would be the guy that looks
like Batman.

140
00:08:50,926 --> 00:08:52,595
I didn't say look like Batman.

141
00:08:52,596 --> 00:08:55,353
You did Tre. You said the the guy looked like Batman

142
00:08:55,354 --> 00:08:57,786
And you said like a mask and stuff
And a cape?
Yeah like Batman.

143
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,881
I didn't say like Batman -
I never said Batman-

144
00:09:01,338 --> 00:09:02,453
OK

145
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:05,317
Let me tell you the problem I
got with that, Tre.

146
00:09:05,681 --> 00:09:09,876
Our mole with the
Russians tells things a little different.

147
00:09:10,902 --> 00:09:15,039
according to him, you've sold him my coke
and you took the money

148
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,633
That's a fucking lie!

149
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:20,785
I can't believe that you would believe this shit from
a fucking Russian, man.

150
00:09:21,044 --> 00:09:23,512
Let's see, Tre. What's more likely?

151
00:09:24,593 --> 00:09:26,413
That you're a greedy little cocksucker,

152
00:09:26,414 --> 00:09:29,123
Or that all my coke was stolen by Superman?
Batman.

153
00:09:29,562 --> 00:09:31,208
I never said Batman!

154
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:32,285
Enough

155
00:09:35,497 --> 00:09:38,197
My son is waitin' out there in the car
to go to the movies.

156
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:40,025
And I aint gonna to disappoint him

157
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,561
Joe, you're in charge

158
00:09:43,647 --> 00:09:46,362
Thanks -
That's gotta be the worst fuckin' excuse I ever heard, Tre.
(Screaming)

159
00:09:54,377 --> 00:09:55,538
Sorry you had to wait, buddy.

160
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:57,191
The movie is starting in 10 minutes

161
00:09:57,192 --> 00:09:58,674
It's O.K. We're cool.

162
00:09:59,211 --> 00:10:00,388
We're only gonna miss the trailers.

163
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:01,935
Yeah, but I wanted to,
get some popcorn.

164
00:10:02,231 --> 00:10:04,072
When we get in there, get Chris some
popcorn.

165
00:10:04,073 --> 00:10:05,161
Okay?

166
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:07,707
What do you wanna drink, wanna Pepsi?

167
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:08,652
That's fine

168
00:10:08,749 --> 00:10:10,439
get him pepsi
And I'll have an Icee.

169
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,161
Mixed

170
00:10:12,873 --> 00:10:14,606
Like, when they mix the red one and the blue one?
(gun shot in background)

171
00:10:16,982 --> 00:10:18,064
And a pack of Twizzlers.

172
00:10:39,378 --> 00:10:40,725
The comic-books had it wrong.

173
00:10:41,219 --> 00:10:46,190
It didn't take a trauma, or cosmic
rays or a power ring to make a superhero.

174
00:10:47,532 --> 00:10:51,370
...Just the perfect combination of
optimism and naivety.

175
00:11:24,102 --> 00:11:26,495
You are fucking awesome.

176
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,822
C'mon

177
00:11:57,108 --> 00:12:02,741
Daddy? I'm scared.
C'mon Mindy, honey. Be a big girl now. There's nothin' to be afraid of.

178
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:07,468
Is it gonna hurt bad?
oh, child. Only for a second, sugar.

179
00:12:07,908 --> 00:12:13,252
Handgun bullet travels at....more than?
700 miles an hour.
700 miles an hour.

180
00:12:13,253 --> 00:12:20,535
So at close range like this, the force is gonna take
you off your feet, for sure. But it's really no more painful than a punch in the chest.

181
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,200
I hate getting punched in the
chest.

182
00:12:23,678 --> 00:12:24,876
You're gonna be fine, baby doll.

183
00:12:32,894 --> 00:12:33,655
How was that?

184
00:12:33,656 --> 00:12:34,746
Not so bad.

185
00:12:35,164 --> 00:12:36,375
Kinda fun, huh?

186
00:12:37,054 --> 00:12:38,148
Now you know how it feels,

187
00:12:38,535 --> 00:12:41,761
you won't be scared when some junkie
asshole pulls a Glock.

188
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,089
Wouldn't have been scared anyways.

189
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:44,601
That's my girl! 'kay.

190
00:12:44,602 --> 00:12:46,337
Up you get.

191
00:12:46,338 --> 00:12:48,861
Two more rounds, and then home.

192
00:12:48,862 --> 00:12:49,707
Again?

193
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:50,622
Uh-huh.

194
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:53,379
Only if we can go by the bowling alley
on the way back.

195
00:12:53,917 --> 00:12:55,811
Bowling alley?

196
00:12:55,812 --> 00:12:56,726
Yep

197
00:12:56,727 --> 00:12:58,031
And then icecream after

198
00:13:00,369 --> 00:13:01,163
Hmm. Okay.

199
00:13:01,164 --> 00:13:02,679
Two more rounds,

200
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:08,039
no wincing, no whining and you got yourself a
deal, young lady.

201
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:10,707
I'm gonna get Hot fudge sundae.

202
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,583
Good call, baby doll!

203
00:13:15,933 --> 00:13:18,272
So you gonna tell a little more about what you might
want

204
00:13:18,273 --> 00:13:19,257
for your birthday?

205
00:13:19,762 --> 00:13:20,816
Can I get a puppy?

206
00:13:22,585 --> 00:13:23,787
Do you want to get a dog?

207
00:13:24,075 --> 00:13:25,754
Yeah. A cuddly fluffy one.

208
00:13:25,897 --> 00:13:28,269
And a Bratz Moviestar Makeover Sasha.

209
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:35,126
Just fucking with you daddy!

210
00:13:35,126 --> 00:13:38,078
I'd love a Benchmade model-42 butterfly
knife.

211
00:13:38,113 --> 00:13:42,598
Oh child. You always knock me for a loop.

212
00:13:42,859 --> 00:13:44,599
Know what?
I'm gonna get you two

213
00:13:44,633 --> 00:13:46,982
Two? -
Yes -

214
00:13:47,797 --> 00:13:48,878
That's what you get.

215
00:14:21,793 --> 00:14:23,203
I'll be honest,

216
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:25,998
there wasn't a whole lotta crime
fighting in those first few weeks.

217
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:30,092
But even so, my new vocation kept
me plenty busy.

218
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:39,533
I called it preparation.

219
00:14:41,717 --> 00:14:43,392
But if you called it fantasizing,

220
00:14:43,427 --> 00:14:45,594
it woulda been hard to argue.

221
00:14:45,629 --> 00:14:49,949
All I knew was I never felt so good about myself.

222
00:15:05,647 --> 00:15:06,372
Fuck!

223
00:15:08,218 --> 00:15:11,498
Okay, maybe I was still in the beta testing
phase.

224
00:15:11,498 --> 00:15:13,723
But it was a start.

225
00:15:29,758 --> 00:15:31,626
what the fuck are you looking at?

226
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:32,893
Nothing

227
00:15:32,926 --> 00:15:34,598
Get the fuck out of here

228
00:15:39,303 --> 00:15:45,302
Like every serial killer already knew, eventually
fantasizing just doesnt do it for you anymore.

229
00:15:45,302 --> 00:15:47,122
It was time to engage

230
00:15:53,788 --> 00:15:55,273
what the fuck?

231
00:16:03,346 --> 00:16:04,841
what the fuck are you looking at?

232
00:16:06,054 --> 00:16:08,282
I said what the fuck are you looking at?

233
00:16:13,011 --> 00:16:18,765
Two cheapshit losers screwing with a car that
somebody probably worked their ass off to pay for.

234
00:16:19,182 --> 00:16:20,242
Say what?

235
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,013
Leave it be man.

236
00:16:22,046 --> 00:16:25,066
This Motherfucker is obviously high.

237
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:27,377
I'm not high.

238
00:16:27,378 --> 00:16:30,881
I just think it sucks you guys think you can do
what you want.

239
00:16:31,956 --> 00:16:34,694
Just walk away from the car,
and we can just forget about it.

240
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,053
You crazy, man!

241
00:16:39,218 --> 00:16:40,509
Fuck this shit!

242
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,088
shit!

243
00:17:36,402 --> 00:17:40,112
I came out just long enough to beg the medics not to tell
anybody about the costume

244
00:17:41,345 --> 00:17:42,798
He promised he wouldn't

245
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:47,153
All I knew was that my dad was gonna kill me.

246
00:18:01,262 --> 00:18:03,748
Why can not I get a gun?
I am the security guard

247
00:18:03,748 --> 00:18:06,267
You're a doorman, now. You don't get a gun no more.

248
00:18:06,267 --> 00:18:09,237
Look at me. I look like a putz.
You look sharp. Look at all them buttons

249
00:18:09,907 --> 00:18:11,938
Do your job. Open the fucking door

250
00:18:14,631 --> 00:18:16,158
Have a nice day

251
00:18:42,972 --> 00:18:43,989
Good Morning Frank

252
00:18:44,396 --> 00:18:45,629
Hey Joe. How ya doin'?

253
00:18:45,629 --> 00:18:47,579
Great -
want some coffee? -

254
00:18:47,773 --> 00:18:48,985
Maybe later

255
00:18:49,178 --> 00:18:49,778
Good morning Angie

256
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,167
Chris -
Good Morning Joe -

257
00:18:53,024 --> 00:18:54,664
Frank we got a thing

258
00:18:56,551 --> 00:18:58,298
It's a big thing Frank

259
00:19:01,328 --> 00:19:02,729
OK

260
00:19:03,066 --> 00:19:04,579
Sorry for the very

261
00:19:05,417 --> 00:19:06,905
do what you gotta do

262
00:19:11,113 --> 00:19:12,608
Chris, where you think you're going?

263
00:19:12,608 --> 00:19:13,708
I gotta talk to dad.

264
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:14,458
Christopher

265
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:15,749
Frank Honey

266
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,583
Where do you think you're going?

267
00:19:20,024 --> 00:19:22,287
I don't mind you talking business. Dad

268
00:19:22,769 --> 00:19:26,391
I was just gonna sit in there quietly. I mean I should probably
start learning and stuff, anyway, right?.

269
00:19:26,391 --> 00:19:28,138
Go finish your oatmeal

270
00:19:28,138 --> 00:19:31,462
Goddamit! I'm gonna be 18 in eight months for
chrissakes.

271
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:35,789
Just sit

272
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:39,992
So, what's the problem?

273
00:19:39,965 --> 00:19:44,443
Our Russian says Tre just sold them
another 5 K's, at half price.

274
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:46,918
Which Tre? Tre Tre?

275
00:19:46,918 --> 00:19:48,858
Right. Dead Tre.

276
00:19:48,858 --> 00:19:50,981
So now I'm getting fucked in the
ass by a ghost.

277
00:19:51,014 --> 00:19:52,652
Or Tre was telling the truth.

278
00:19:52,935 --> 00:19:58,103
What so this is my choice? I have to
believe in ghosts or superheroes?

279
00:19:58,137 --> 00:20:03,030
Not the part about the superhero, Franky.
Just that he mighta really been
gaffled by somebody.

280
00:20:06,462 --> 00:20:10,379
I think we better invited our
Russian friend over for a friendly chat.

281
00:20:12,124 --> 00:20:15,094
See what's really going on.

282
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,685
Hey, early birdy

283
00:20:30,685 --> 00:20:34,117
You beat me to it.
I wanted to get you breakfast this morning

284
00:20:34,911 --> 00:20:36,956
Happy birthday, sweetheart

285
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:39,431
check this out

286
00:20:47,429 --> 00:20:50,146
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

287
00:20:50,146 --> 00:20:51,311
Oh my God

288
00:20:51,977 --> 00:20:52,449
dad

289
00:20:56,204 --> 00:20:56,797
Wow

290
00:20:57,044 --> 00:20:58,116
Wow, dad

291
00:20:58,934 --> 00:21:00,417
Ok, pop quiz

292
00:21:00,695 --> 00:21:02,299
What is the proper name for one of those?

293
00:21:02,299 --> 00:21:04,229
Isabelle It's...uh...Filippino. Ask me another one.

294
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:05,961
Excellent, good.

295
00:21:05,961 --> 00:21:11,583
The AR 15 was a lighter, smaller caliber version
of what design?

296
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:14,415
Eugene 7 AR-10
Give me a hard one.

297
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:21,155
Name John Woo's first full length feature.

298
00:21:21,189 --> 00:21:22,866
Chi bi xia: Jue zhan tian xia

299
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,578
Daddy look

300
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,370
Hey, come on, you're not looking

301
00:21:29,741 --> 00:21:33,506
the point is some fucker's killing our guys

302
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:38,447
If you find out who that is I don't  wanna see
any of you bitches sitting on your asses all right!!

303
00:21:38,482 --> 00:21:39,951
What the fuck you....?

304
00:21:39,985 --> 00:21:41,268
Hello

305
00:21:41,632 --> 00:21:43,172
Hey Joe, yeah

306
00:21:43,523 --> 00:21:45,965
No, I was just training right now

307
00:21:45,998 --> 00:21:46,708
one second

308
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,816
Dad.....phone.

309
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:52,236
Dad, the phone's for you

310
00:21:52,775 --> 00:21:55,435
Who is it?
it's Joe

311
00:21:58,816 --> 00:22:01,896
what's the problem? -
Yeah, Frank turns out, man's got the vice here no more.

312
00:22:02,088 --> 00:22:03,354
Really -
aha -

313
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,135
But we do got a brand new industrial microwave they use her for treating the lumber.

314
00:22:08,169 --> 00:22:09,355
So where is it?

315
00:22:09,807 --> 00:22:14,179
I think you must be confusing me with someone who gives a shit about the fucking lumber

316
00:22:14,214 --> 00:22:18,745
Well, you're right, I'm sorry, -
Just grabbed the information -

317
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:21,036
Alright come on, go ahead

318
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:24,388
Hey look the guy told me he killed Fernandez

319
00:22:24,422 --> 00:22:25,826
What I know ? -
Shut up -

320
00:22:25,861 --> 00:22:27,385
Jesus Fernandez is dead.

321
00:22:27,418 --> 00:22:28,921
Now, shut up

322
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,454
He lied, so...

323
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,453
Works like a regular microwave, or what?

324
00:22:35,485 --> 00:22:39,085
Fuck do I know? We're not making a fucking Hungry Man dinner here, just turn it on!

325
00:22:42,186 --> 00:22:42,950
Here we go

326
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:46,181
O.K. I want to know who sold you our coke?

327
00:22:46,218 --> 00:22:49,095
And don't tell me somebody
who's dead, this time

328
00:22:57,802 --> 00:23:00,692
I said......

329
00:23:04,005 --> 00:23:05,024
Who

330
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,961
Sold

331
00:23:06,961 --> 00:23:08,049
You

332
00:23:08,484 --> 00:23:10,745
Our....coke?

333
00:23:13,345 --> 00:23:14,617
Shit

334
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:20,797
This is awesome

335
00:23:21,334 --> 00:23:22,835
I look like freakin' Wolverine.

336
00:23:24,008 --> 00:23:26,734
They still have that metal detector
at your school?

337
00:23:26,769 --> 00:23:30,102
Yeah, It's gonna have a meltdown!

338
00:23:31,257 --> 00:23:33,405
Dave, I need to ask you something.

339
00:23:35,397 --> 00:23:36,075
OK

340
00:23:36,452 --> 00:23:38,010
The police report...

341
00:23:38,343 --> 00:23:41,918
They found you naked. You said you didn't remember why.

342
00:23:42,482 --> 00:23:44,346
The muggers... they didn't...?

343
00:23:45,462 --> 00:23:46,560
What?

344
00:23:49,174 --> 00:23:49,956
No

345
00:23:49,957 --> 00:23:52,188
Jesus! No!

346
00:23:52,189 --> 00:23:53,852
I wasn't even...

347
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:56,590
In the ambulance, they threw
my clothes away!

348
00:23:56,591 --> 00:23:57,834
Cause of the blood.
Right

349
00:24:05,917 --> 00:24:08,214
I know I not at all as far as back on my feet

350
00:24:08,215 --> 00:24:10,563
Dave, What?  -
Shhhs.

351
00:24:11,786 --> 00:24:13,449
Apart from the messed up nerve ending.

352
00:24:13,547 --> 00:24:15,326
The doctors had managed to fix me up pretty good.

353
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:17,752
Did you feel that?

354
00:24:17,922 --> 00:24:18,419
No

355
00:24:18,873 --> 00:24:21,446
You're like fucking Jason Bourne or
something! That owns!

356
00:24:21,479 --> 00:24:23,698
How about that?
No. Marty,

357
00:24:23,699 --> 00:24:25,884
give it a fuckin' rest,
man.

358
00:24:25,621 --> 00:24:28,914
I've only been back, like,
half a day and already youre
making fun of me at the hospital.

359
00:24:28,914 --> 00:24:30,439
He's right
I'm sorry

360
00:24:30,439 --> 00:24:32,881
truly childish

361
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,911
Hey

362
00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:49,201
Dave Hey

363
00:24:51,202 --> 00:24:51,957
Oh, hey

364
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,894
How are you?

365
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,304
You look better

366
00:24:55,338 --> 00:24:56,503
I'm OK

367
00:24:57,273 --> 00:24:58,968
Yeah, much better

368
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,895
Hey, youre into comic books, arent
you?

369
00:25:00,929 --> 00:25:03,909
Well... me and Erika sometimes hang out
after school at this really great store,

370
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:08,578
Atomic Comics. They make the best like Crack-a-back-a-latte.

371
00:25:08,611 --> 00:25:09,573
Yeah...?

372
00:25:12,479 --> 00:25:17,416
Well... I could buy you one
... sometime if you want? If you,
like, need someone to talk to?

373
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:21,188
sure, thank you

374
00:25:21,223 --> 00:25:23,855
Ok. Sweet. Well I'll
see you later

375
00:25:28,187 --> 00:25:29,432
Man, did you just see that?!
Yeah -

376
00:25:29,464 --> 00:25:31,177
Katie Deauxma just offered to buy me coffee

377
00:25:31,211 --> 00:25:34,146
Yeah..I really don't think that's the way it looks like

378
00:25:34,181 --> 00:25:35,263
What are you talking about?

379
00:25:35,297 --> 00:25:38,524
The point is, Katie Deauxma is all
about the lame ducks.

380
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:40,809
What's that got to do with me?

381
00:25:40,841 --> 00:25:43,003
I've been trying to figure out how to tell you this

382
00:25:43,036 --> 00:25:46,187
There's a rumor going around, right...

383
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,316
that you...
what?
are gay

384
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,588
Gay!!!

385
00:25:49,622 --> 00:25:51,214
What kind of rumor is that?

386
00:25:51,247 --> 00:25:52,787
Well you know, getting mugged...

387
00:25:52,821 --> 00:25:54,044
You guys have been mugged!

388
00:25:54,078 --> 00:25:57,844
Yeah, I know...but...you know..
we didn't get beat up and have all our clothes taken off.

389
00:25:57,878 --> 00:26:00,196
That's not even true! The medics
threw my clothes away!

390
00:26:01,505 --> 00:26:04,445
Don't worry about it. Rumors don't mean shit.
We know the truth

391
00:26:04,478 --> 00:26:05,400
Right? -
Yes -

392
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:07,683
Yeah. And who knows, it might even
get you laid.

393
00:26:07,718 --> 00:26:09,485
Not if she thinks he's gay, Todd,

394
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:10,902
you fuckin' retard!

395
00:26:10,935 --> 00:26:13,308
Thanks a lot, Marty.
You aint fucking helping me-

396
00:26:13,341 --> 00:26:14,157
I'm just being honest

397
00:26:17,891 --> 00:26:20,151
I was getting back to my old self

398
00:26:20,186 --> 00:26:21,493
I should have quit, of course.

399
00:26:22,699 --> 00:26:24,479
But you can't just re-program
yourself

400
00:26:25,228 --> 00:26:27,837
what you want, who you
are... your purpose in life.

401
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:30,374
oh no...I'm just stand around here

402
00:26:30,407 --> 00:26:34,481
It is what it is.

403
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,038
You didn't see that did ya?

404
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,778
I think it's best that you just walk away

405
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:43,055
Well maybe you shouldn't do that.

406
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:44,225
What?
Huh?

407
00:26:44,654 --> 00:26:45,188
You looking at me?

408
00:26:45,545 --> 00:26:46,650
Well this is my baby.

409
00:26:57,973 --> 00:26:58,970
Me?

410
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,337
My hardware was fixed now.

411
00:27:00,975 --> 00:27:04,606
I was back and running Kick-ass
version 2.0

412
00:27:13,935 --> 00:27:15,438
Excuse me, did you see this cat?

413
00:27:15,804 --> 00:27:16,300
No

414
00:27:18,332 --> 00:27:20,148
Excuse me, Madam, Have you seen this cat?

415
00:27:23,173 --> 00:27:25,002
I'm sorry, did you see this cat?

416
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:49,095
Great

417
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,119
Come, Kitty

418
00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:53,807
Mr. Bitey

419
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:00,344
Come on, no, no

420
00:28:00,882 --> 00:28:02,256
No, no, Mr. Bitey Come on

421
00:28:02,642 --> 00:28:04,284
Here, I get you home

422
00:28:04,352 --> 00:28:05,485
Come on

423
00:28:14,216 --> 00:28:18,983
Fuck you Mr. Bitey!!

424
00:28:23,516 --> 00:28:24,787
Oh God...I'm so sorry, man

425
00:28:25,229 --> 00:28:27,888
You fucking Green......!!!!

426
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:32,387
Hey freak...

427
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:35,265
Hey, leave it alone

428
00:28:35,724 --> 00:28:38,008
Fuck off man.

429
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:41,699
Guess it is.

430
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,341
Hey, Call 911

431
00:29:16,308 --> 00:29:19,681
There's a dude dressed like a superhero out there fighting a bunch of guys.

432
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:25,580
It's Fucking awesome!!!

433
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:53,620
Leave him alone

434
00:29:59,884 --> 00:30:00,928
Give it up man.

435
00:30:01,054 --> 00:30:01,771
Just walk away

436
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,329
No, never

437
00:30:05,641 --> 00:30:07,216
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?

438
00:30:07,245 --> 00:30:08,900
You'd rather die for some piece of shit?

439
00:30:09,881 --> 00:30:11,445
That you don't even fucking know?

440
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:15,695
You're just three asholes laying into one guy while everyone else watches.

441
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:18,794
And you wanna know what's wrong with me?

442
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:23,536
Yeah, I'd rather die.

443
00:30:23,979 --> 00:30:25,427
You bring it on!!
(Police sirens in background)

444
00:30:29,843 --> 00:30:31,124
You're fucking crazy kid

445
00:30:38,929 --> 00:30:40,085
What?

446
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:42,400
Thank you!

447
00:30:45,223 --> 00:30:46,635
That fucking rocks!

448
00:30:47,086 --> 00:30:47,446
Who are you?

449
00:30:50,255 --> 00:30:51,460
I'm Kick Ass

450
00:30:55,758 --> 00:30:57,483
Dude you gotta check this shit out.

451
00:30:57,783 --> 00:30:59,308
what is it?

452
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:10,067
And coming up after the hour: a costumed vigilante has become the
latest Internet phenomenon after a Hamilton Park resident filmed the
man's remarkable intervention in a gang-related attack last week...

453
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:11,272
Pretty awesome

454
00:31:11,361 --> 00:31:12,019
Fuck Yeah.

455
00:31:12,132 --> 00:31:14,465
Welcome to this special edition
of Eye on New York

456
00:31:15,101 --> 00:31:17,632
How far would you go to help your fellow man?

457
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:20,431
This cowel covered individual has been all over the news this week

458
00:31:20,508 --> 00:31:22,406
After this video of his intervention of street gang violence

459
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,941
became the most watched web on the Internet

460
00:31:30,108 --> 00:31:31,831
On My Space, 38 press

461
00:31:32,218 --> 00:31:35,741
Kick-Ass is my favorite. 16,000 and counting.

462
00:31:36,037 --> 00:31:37,651
This thing was going crazy

463
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:39,589
And I was loving it

464
00:31:39,729 --> 00:31:42,739
Finally, we want to know who is this man

465
00:31:43,032 --> 00:31:46,361
Does anyone have any
idea who this wet suit Crusader is?

466
00:31:46,758 --> 00:31:50,836
He must be someone's son...
Someone's brother....
Someone's next door neighbor...

467
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:52,374
Holy shit. What happened?

468
00:31:52,614 --> 00:31:54,185
what happened?

469
00:31:54,219 --> 00:31:56,469
This guy happened.

470
00:31:57,092 --> 00:31:58,439
This right there from her everybody

471
00:32:00,342 --> 00:32:02,529
Everbody's favorite superhero right now is Kick-Ass, right?

472
00:32:02,898 --> 00:32:03,683
Kick-Ass!! Yeah!!!

473
00:32:06,719 --> 00:32:08,315
I like Kick-Ass

474
00:32:12,981 --> 00:32:14,690
You know what? Everyone likes Kick-Ass

475
00:32:15,922 --> 00:32:17,803
He sure does give plenty of action for the guests

476
00:32:17,804 --> 00:32:20,159
Good at gettting his Ass-Kicked.

477
00:32:20,592 --> 00:32:23,108
He should call himself Ass-Kick, instead

478
00:32:23,912 --> 00:32:25,473
That doesn't even make any sense.

479
00:32:28,387 --> 00:32:29,931
That guy's gonna end up dead that's what I think.

480
00:32:29,932 --> 00:32:31,036
Are you serious? The guy owns.

481
00:32:31,037 --> 00:32:34,745
I'd probably notify him about it if a problem needed fixing.

482
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:38,668
What you kidding me? I have 100 guys can fix a problem.
You gotta some guy in some panty-hose?

483
00:32:39,263 --> 00:32:41,353
Well, I wouldn't wanna get in the way of your business...

484
00:32:41,354 --> 00:32:42,959
where I'm not wanted.

485
00:32:44,633 --> 00:32:46,818
Please, I know you are mistaking me for Kick-Ass, but I am not Kick-Ass.

486
00:32:51,048 --> 00:32:53,060
I'm backed up right now

487
00:32:53,061 --> 00:32:54,210
your message has been sent

488
00:32:58,914 --> 00:33:01,219
Hey Dave
How about that coffee? Katie X

489
00:33:05,209 --> 00:33:06,851
You don't actually read comics?

490
00:33:06,852 --> 00:33:08,063
Yeah, I just started. It got right to my system.

491
00:33:08,063 --> 00:33:12,108
It's got full graphs and shows you leads, that kind of thing.

492
00:33:12,252 --> 00:33:14,267
I'm not really into Polk superheroes or not.

493
00:33:16,313 --> 00:33:19,551
So...guess you're not gonna be lining up for
that new Kick-Ass comic, then.

494
00:33:19,552 --> 00:33:20,505
I guess not.

495
00:33:21,513 --> 00:33:26,106
You know what, I was seriously thinking of
e-mailing his site? I mean I could really use some help
from a guy like that right now.

496
00:33:26,616 --> 00:33:28,689
Help? Really? What with?

497
00:33:29,891 --> 00:33:31,573
You know I volunteer at the
needle exchange?

498
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:33,545
No, I didnt.

499
00:33:33,546 --> 00:33:37,132
there was this one guy,
Rasul? And I just felt so sorry for him and...

500
00:33:37,133 --> 00:33:40,188
more I found out about his up bringing and stuff I just...

501
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:44,475
Wow, that's weird

502
00:33:44,764 --> 00:33:46,662
I'm usually the one playing therapist.

503
00:33:49,548 --> 00:33:50,989
Can I make a confession?

504
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:53,783
Ever since
I was little

505
00:33:53,784 --> 00:33:56,325
I always wanted a
friend...

506
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:57,660
....like....you.

507
00:33:58,751 --> 00:33:59,792
Is it okay to say that?

508
00:34:00,328 --> 00:34:01,711
I mean its not homophobic, is it?

509
00:34:03,829 --> 00:34:05,633
I mean I don't think you're all the
same or anything.

510
00:34:14,851 --> 00:34:16,952
Of course not. No.

511
00:34:18,035 --> 00:34:18,931
Thank you

512
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:26,624
I don't know if I was everything Katie had
always dreamed her gay b.f.f. would be.

513
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,628
But I tried my best.

514
00:34:29,244 --> 00:34:32,335
But, more importantly, I
talked her into e-mailing Kick-Ass.

515
00:34:33,684 --> 00:34:34,901
Long story short,

516
00:34:35,561 --> 00:34:39,729
this particular lame duck of hers
turned out to be more of a lame cobra.

517
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:45,683
She didnt want the money back that
she'd given him, or an apology for
the black eye he'd given her.

518
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:47,887
She just wanted him to get that they
were through,

519
00:34:47,887 --> 00:34:49,187
and leave her alone.

520
00:34:49,676 --> 00:34:50,910
lets be real

521
00:34:51,504 --> 00:34:53,806
no other request could've given
me more pleasure.

522
00:35:10,133 --> 00:35:12,972
Who the fuck you're supposed to be?
The Greeen Condom?

523
00:35:14,736 --> 00:35:16,675
You know it ain't Halloween for another few
months, kid.

524
00:35:17,306 --> 00:35:18,640
I'm here to see Rasul

525
00:35:20,774 --> 00:35:21,743
Who the fuck are you?

526
00:35:22,298 --> 00:35:25,025
I am a friend of Katie's

527
00:35:31,185 --> 00:35:32,657
Boys Do not pay attention to their appearance these days.........

528
00:35:46,891 --> 00:35:49,475
So Uhh....which one of you guys is Rasul?

529
00:35:56,273 --> 00:35:59,885
I am Rasul. Can't you tell by my big titty's?

530
00:36:03,344 --> 00:36:04,525
What is this? Trick or treat or somethin'?

531
00:36:07,036 --> 00:36:07,615
fuck

532
00:36:08,103 --> 00:36:08,892
And now I am dead

533
00:36:09,995 --> 00:36:11,726
I have a message for Rasul.

534
00:36:12,543 --> 00:36:13,706
About Katie Deauxma.

535
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:17,246
Katie?

536
00:36:17,683 --> 00:36:18,604
Oh you're Rasul?

537
00:36:19,155 --> 00:36:20,302
Ok.

538
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,016
You've gotta stay
away from Katie now.

539
00:36:22,518 --> 00:36:23,234
It's over.
So if you just...

540
00:36:23,703 --> 00:36:25,596
leave her alone.

541
00:36:25,597 --> 00:36:26,851
everything will be fine

542
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,408
What?

543
00:36:29,953 --> 00:36:30,732
Yo Kid...

544
00:36:31,094 --> 00:36:31,846
Who the hell are you?

545
00:36:32,842 --> 00:36:33,721
What is this?

546
00:36:34,256 --> 00:36:36,716
I'm Kick-Ass.
Look me up.

547
00:36:37,422 --> 00:36:39,175
And this is me giving you a message:

548
00:36:39,693 --> 00:36:41,382
leave Katie alone

549
00:36:53,708 --> 00:36:54,437
Or what?

550
00:36:59,135 --> 00:37:00,164
Or

551
00:37:00,638 --> 00:37:04,464
I'll come back and break your
fucking legs.

552
00:37:09,288 --> 00:37:10,241
I'm right here now, baby

553
00:37:10,241 --> 00:37:11,343
Malcolm...

554
00:37:21,188 --> 00:37:21,725
hold him

555
00:37:28,189 --> 00:37:29,119
Heck

556
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,560
You're so fuckin' dead

557
00:37:45,182 --> 00:37:47,172
Ok, you cunt

558
00:37:47,173 --> 00:37:48,941
Let see what you can do now.
Eany...Meany...Miney...Mo

559
00:38:13,886 --> 00:38:14,892
what's that?

560
00:38:41,441 --> 00:38:42,875
Hey, I have one of those

561
00:39:00,235 --> 00:39:00,851
Come on

562
00:39:02,163 --> 00:39:03,179
So you wanna play

563
00:39:19,403 --> 00:39:20,741
what the fuck

564
00:39:24,032 --> 00:39:26,838
Aww dude, that is one fuckin' gay fuckin'
taser.

565
00:39:29,924 --> 00:39:31,168
Relax . We're on the same team.

566
00:39:33,312 --> 00:39:33,872
Hey get Up

567
00:39:40,346 --> 00:39:43,837
Now, Hit Girl, we always keep our backs where?

568
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,723
To the wall, Daddy I know.

569
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,348
Um...it won't happen again

570
00:39:49,564 --> 00:39:50,524
Nice shot by the way

571
00:39:50,525 --> 00:39:51,378
Thank you

572
00:40:08,951 --> 00:40:09,529
Be careful.

573
00:40:11,596 --> 00:40:14,528
Hey, Green asshole. Can't use the front
door.

574
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:29,789
Wait, wait, wait.
What?

575
00:40:33,353 --> 00:40:34,275
Who are you?

576
00:40:34,902 --> 00:40:35,712
Me?

577
00:40:36,799 --> 00:40:37,849
I'm
"Hit Girl"

578
00:40:39,931 --> 00:40:41,691
and that's " Big Daddy"

579
00:40:48,203 --> 00:40:48,975
Come on

580
00:40:54,175 --> 00:40:54,876
Come on!

581
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,973
"Hit Girl" and
"Big Daddy"

582
00:41:32,348 --> 00:41:33,706
They were real deal.

583
00:41:36,444 --> 00:41:37,089
Me

584
00:41:38,097 --> 00:41:40,462
I was just a
stupid dick in a wetsuit.

585
00:41:55,686 --> 00:41:57,167
What is this, What am I lookin' at here?

586
00:41:57,534 --> 00:42:00,432
It was Sal's phone. They found it in his hand.

587
00:42:00,883 --> 00:42:02,927
They must have taken that right before he died

588
00:42:03,336 --> 00:42:10,607
I know this sounds fucked up, Franky...but
that guy in the picture...I think it's that
superhero nut job from the TV.

589
00:42:10,999 --> 00:42:12,140
Who?

590
00:42:12,756 --> 00:42:13,905
Kick-Ass?

591
00:42:15,041 --> 00:42:15,838
One guy?

592
00:42:17,103 --> 00:42:19,470
Hold on. You telling me one guy killed 8 of my men tonight?

593
00:42:24,501 --> 00:42:28,017
Eight at Sal's place...4 at that kid, Rasul's.

594
00:42:29,727 --> 00:42:31,435
We have no mercenaries on the streets at all.
Right.

595
00:42:31,436 --> 00:42:32,433
Made to understand?

596
00:42:35,455 --> 00:42:36,356
One Guy

597
00:42:36,889 --> 00:42:37,609
You think?

598
00:42:37,998 --> 00:42:41,216
Nah if you're right, we're gonna look like the biggest bunch of pussies in New York

599
00:42:42,422 --> 00:42:43,301
What do you want me to do?

600
00:42:44,752 --> 00:42:49,226
I want Kick-Ass' fuckin' head on a stick. And I want it now.

601
00:42:58,569 --> 00:43:00,506
I didn't say anything, to anyone, I
swear!

602
00:43:00,507 --> 00:43:02,861
Good move. Ass, Kick.

603
00:43:02,862 --> 00:43:04,383
Let's keep it that way.

604
00:43:05,576 --> 00:43:06,866
You know what this is?

605
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:11,295
All the cartridge crap that comes outta
your gay little taser when you fire it.

606
00:43:11,766 --> 00:43:14,704
Do you know the police could've traced it
right back to you if they'd found it?

607
00:43:15,282 --> 00:43:17,693
Lucky for you, I
picked it up.

608
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:20,164
Thank you.

609
00:43:21,603 --> 00:43:22,402
Let's call it insurance.

610
00:43:22,403 --> 00:43:25,189
Makes it easier for me to take your word.

611
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:28,192
See, we like you. But we don't trust you.

612
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:32,084
Don't take it personal though. We
don't trust anybody.

613
00:43:32,085 --> 00:43:38,587
I re-routed your IP address. Finding you was way too easy.

614
00:43:39,169 --> 00:43:40,022
Aw Shit. Shit

615
00:43:40,404 --> 00:43:43,548
I hadn't thought - My God, I...

616
00:43:43,935 --> 00:43:44,886
I owe you

617
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:47,940
You know what? I'm thinking of
shutting my site down anyway,

618
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:52,268
quitting. This is... fucking insane.

619
00:43:52,635 --> 00:43:54,799
I'm in way over my head.

620
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,163
It's a shame. You have potential.

621
00:43:57,164 --> 00:44:00,118
Your call, son. But, y'know, were
around if you need us.

622
00:44:01,675 --> 00:44:02,674
How do I get hold of you?

623
00:44:03,242 --> 00:44:07,114
Just contact the mayor's office.
He has a special signal he
shines in the sky?

624
00:44:07,684 --> 00:44:08,927
It's in the shape of a giant cock.

625
00:44:10,257 --> 00:44:12,428
You need us, put on your web site that
you're on vacation.

626
00:44:12,429 --> 00:44:13,447
We'll find you.

627
00:44:13,641 --> 00:44:14,706
Hit Girl, back to headquarters

628
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:18,557
Sweet dreams.

629
00:44:24,597 --> 00:44:25,784
I need you to get rid of Kick-Ass.

630
00:44:25,784 --> 00:44:27,279
What's up?

631
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,365
What's up?

632
00:44:28,936 --> 00:44:31,598
Kick-Ass is killing my men,  Gigante, that's
what's up

633
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,727
My condolences.

634
00:44:34,336 --> 00:44:37,472
But I'm afraid I can't help you out on this one.

635
00:44:37,473 --> 00:44:39,370
He's movin' outside my jurisdiction.

636
00:44:39,772 --> 00:44:41,187
Outside your jurisdiction?

637
00:44:41,853 --> 00:44:46,390
You're a fucking cop and he's breaking the
law! That's so inside your jurisdiction it's ball-deep in
your jurisdiction's ass!

638
00:44:46,942 --> 00:44:50,830
The boss pays me to nail the
bad guys. You pay me not to.

639
00:44:51,404 --> 00:44:52,931
Everything else is in the grey area.

640
00:44:52,932 --> 00:44:55,169
Yeah, Fuck you very much, Vic. Just do
it, okay?

641
00:44:57,255 --> 00:44:58,313
Un-fuckin'believable

642
00:45:00,168 --> 00:45:00,924
where is Cody?

643
00:45:01,736 --> 00:45:02,568
He's late

644
00:45:02,569 --> 00:45:06,637
Thank you, Cody. We appreciate
your cooperation.

645
00:45:06,638 --> 00:45:07,788
Let me out now?

646
00:45:08,533 --> 00:45:09,827
I gave you all them names and
address.

647
00:45:11,678 --> 00:45:15,278
Hey, I won't say nothing to nobody. You and you're crazy bitch friend can go back to where ever you once

648
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:17,682
... Hey c'mon now...that's a very bad thing you're doing now..

649
00:45:17,961 --> 00:45:19,627
Really nasty individuals...

650
00:45:20,015 --> 00:45:22,591
Let me go, Hey...
Do not do this

651
00:45:23,434 --> 00:45:24,325
Come on!!

652
00:45:24,358 --> 00:45:25,530
please..hey..stop!!!

653
00:45:33,456 --> 00:45:34,641
stop, please!!
(Screaming)

654
00:45:48,594 --> 00:45:50,044
What a douche.

655
00:46:03,045 --> 00:46:04,612
You've done a self tan before, right?

656
00:46:06,021 --> 00:46:08,295
Yeah, I do it all the time.

657
00:46:08,994 --> 00:46:15,150
Murder. Superheroes breaking into my bedroom.
My life was turning into some fucked up dream I couldn't wake up from

658
00:46:17,058 --> 00:46:19,852
Even with the good parts, were totally surreal

659
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:23,792
Oh hey, I read those old Ditko
Spider-Mans you gave me? They're
actually pretty good.

660
00:46:25,105 --> 00:46:26,481
Yeah, they are.

661
00:46:28,001 --> 00:46:30,207
And it's been a whole week since I've heard from Rasul.

662
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:35,254
That's great.

663
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:32,761
Once upon a time, there were two super cops called
Daddy and Marcus...

664
00:47:33,224 --> 00:47:35,364
who were very good at getting bad guys

665
00:47:36,984 --> 00:47:42,420
Frank Damico was the baddest guy of them all
and he came up with a plan to get rid of Daddy.

666
00:47:46,347 --> 00:47:50,887
Being framed as drug dealer was the worst possible thing
that could have happened to Daddy.

667
00:47:53,483 --> 00:47:56,541
Prison was not his natural habitat

668
00:47:56,966 --> 00:47:58,770
He was very upset.

669
00:48:02,193 --> 00:48:05,899
With Daddy in prison
His pregnant wife was all alone.

670
00:48:07,269 --> 00:48:10,423
And could not cope.

671
00:48:11,068 --> 00:48:13,308
But all clouds have a silver lining.

672
00:48:13,735 --> 00:48:15,119
And out of her death..

673
00:48:19,118 --> 00:48:20,526
Mindy was born

674
00:48:20,967 --> 00:48:23,097
Marcus became the child's guardian

675
00:48:23,706 --> 00:48:26,665
And Daddy started a plan of his very own.

676
00:48:28,766 --> 00:48:30,757
Five years later he left prison

677
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:32,995
And he was ready

678
00:48:36,601 --> 00:48:39,389
Now it's time for Mindy to get ready too.

679
00:48:47,375 --> 00:48:48,609
How'd you find me Marcus?

680
00:48:49,827 --> 00:48:51,728
One of us is still a cop, remember?

681
00:49:00,762 --> 00:49:01,994
Now you brain-washed Mindy?

682
00:49:01,995 --> 00:49:04,759
You say brain-washed
I say made it into a game.

683
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:09,868
What you call this? Playing, Damon?
Vigilante justice. Mass murder. C'mon, partner.

684
00:49:12,237 --> 00:49:13,221
So where is she?

685
00:49:13,877 --> 00:49:15,646
She's safe -
Can I see her? -

686
00:49:17,644 --> 00:49:18,554
I miss her,

687
00:49:20,558 --> 00:49:21,487
I miss you both.

688
00:49:22,938 --> 00:49:24,279
I appreciate your concern.

689
00:49:25,272 --> 00:49:26,271
But you need to go now.

690
00:49:32,243 --> 00:49:35,490
I should warn you that asshole,
Gigante, is looking for Kick-Ass.

691
00:49:35,491 --> 00:49:36,987
He got something to do with you Damon?

692
00:49:37,546 --> 00:49:40,671
You started some kinda fucked-up
superhero club?

693
00:49:40,672 --> 00:49:41,813
Never heard of him

694
00:49:42,304 --> 00:49:44,113
Ok, well heads up, alright?

695
00:49:44,503 --> 00:49:48,417
You keep carrying on like you've been carrying on and it's
only a matter of time before Gigante's
looking for you.

696
00:49:49,352 --> 00:49:52,570
He's been on D'Amicos payroll ever since you
passed up the opportunity,

697
00:49:53,859 --> 00:49:55,219
You know I'm not gonna stop.

698
00:49:57,024 --> 00:50:02,581
Not 'til D'Amico and his whole damn
operation are burnt to ashes.

699
00:50:03,164 --> 00:50:04,375
And buried.

700
00:50:05,858 --> 00:50:07,246
It ain't gonna bring her back, Damon.

701
00:50:08,943 --> 00:50:10,986
This is not the life for Mindy,

702
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,326
You owe that kid a childhood.

703
00:50:17,192 --> 00:50:18,718
I'll tell you who owes her a
childhood:

704
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:21,722
Frank D'Amico

705
00:50:39,922 --> 00:50:41,252
Holy shit

706
00:50:43,823 --> 00:50:45,918
I don't fuckin' believe it.

707
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:50,478
Follow him. Around the corner.

708
00:50:51,828 --> 00:50:52,623
Not too fast

709
00:50:56,357 --> 00:50:57,447
He's doing the high fives.

710
00:50:58,384 --> 00:51:00,213
I'll give 'em a motherfuckin' high five.

711
00:51:00,214 --> 00:51:01,214
High five and bullshit

712
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:03,666
Keep going, keep going.

713
00:51:05,507 --> 00:51:06,596
Not too close

714
00:51:11,554 --> 00:51:12,718
He's going into the alley

715
00:51:13,589 --> 00:51:15,157
He's going to the alley

716
00:51:15,629 --> 00:51:18,164
Okay, when I tell you stop the car.

717
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,618
Ready?

718
00:51:23,219 --> 00:51:24,998
Hey Kick-Ass

719
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:26,570
Hi ya doin'?

720
00:51:29,047 --> 00:51:30,133
Kill my men, huh?!

721
00:51:30,134 --> 00:51:32,022
Take my fucking coke?!

722
00:51:33,897 --> 00:51:34,576
What are you doing?

723
00:51:34,577 --> 00:51:36,030
Let us go, come on

724
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,078
Come on, Frank, he had enough,
Come on.

725
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:42,360
What the fuck are you looking at? Huh?

726
00:51:56,759 --> 00:51:58,688
Come on, let's go
Come on

727
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:09,633
He was so young

728
00:52:09,633 --> 00:52:14,367
Who would get to die that way?
I just can't believe he's dead that's all

729
00:52:16,617 --> 00:52:17,599
Oh, I know.

730
00:52:18,003 --> 00:52:19,291
Listen Katie,

731
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:23,851
guys like Rasul... They get mixed up in
stuff, and...

732
00:52:23,852 --> 00:52:26,656
I know, but what if it was my
fault?

733
00:52:27,137 --> 00:52:30,102
What if Kick-Ass did it?
I mean I feel like should call cops or something

734
00:52:30,102 --> 00:52:32,012
you're talking crazy!

735
00:52:32,013 --> 00:52:34,778
there's no way! He probably
didn't even read your e-mail yet.

736
00:52:35,222 --> 00:52:37,039
Yeah? -
There's nothing to  worry about -

737
00:52:39,247 --> 00:52:40,647
I'm so glad you're here

738
00:52:41,001 --> 00:52:42,452
I look like such a mess

739
00:52:43,036 --> 00:52:44,070
You look Okay.

740
00:52:44,397 --> 00:52:45,453
I'm here

741
00:52:46,423 --> 00:52:47,367
Yeah I'm Okay.

742
00:52:48,905 --> 00:52:50,977
I hope it's Okay to say this, but

743
00:52:51,586 --> 00:52:53,580
It so sucks
that you're gay.

744
00:52:56,075 --> 00:52:59,230
I don't fuckin' believe this

745
00:53:01,758 --> 00:53:04,748
What kind of children's fuckin' entertainer is that? Huh?

746
00:53:06,615 --> 00:53:11,690
What kind of kid has a Spider-Man party sure.  But a fuckin' Kick-Ass Party?

747
00:53:12,162 --> 00:53:14,305
What are they're selling paper plates and napkins down at the store, now?

748
00:53:14,306 --> 00:53:15,736
Frank, You're scarin' me

749
00:53:15,737 --> 00:53:20,643
You're losin' it.
Since when did you start getting your hands dirty again, huh? And in public.

750
00:53:20,684 --> 00:53:23,774
Since when I asked you Fucks to deliver me Kick-Ass and you don't deliver that's when.

751
00:53:23,774 --> 00:53:25,448
Hey give me a break it's been a week.

752
00:53:25,449 --> 00:53:28,908
We  e-mailed him. We got half the crew doing petty crimes as bait

753
00:53:28,909 --> 00:53:30,406
We're bustin' our asses here.

754
00:53:31,777 --> 00:53:32,704
What hell are you doing?

755
00:53:33,871 --> 00:53:35,387
You back on the Powder now, as well?

756
00:53:35,388 --> 00:53:39,560
(In child-like voice)
Mommy,  I want Kick-Ass party.
Dumb little fuck.

757
00:53:40,207 --> 00:53:41,913
I know a way you could get him.

758
00:53:42,188 --> 00:53:43,603
Aww shit. Chris

759
00:53:43,605 --> 00:53:44,682
How long you been there?

760
00:53:44,683 --> 00:53:45,877
What the hell you doin'?
Get the hell out!

761
00:53:45,877 --> 00:53:47,307
You wanna hear it or not?

762
00:53:48,326 --> 00:53:49,126
Hear what?

763
00:53:49,127 --> 00:53:55,179
Okay, look: you're a superhero and
you're lonely but you can't trust anyone because either they'll expose
your secret identity....

764
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:57,677
Comic books, this kids reads, all
fucking day long.

765
00:53:57,678 --> 00:54:00,830
Point is, there's only one way a
superhero would trust a stranger and...

766
00:54:01,336 --> 00:54:03,888
I could be that stranger.
You just gotta give me a chance.

767
00:54:04,379 --> 00:54:06,419
I know I can do
it. I just need a few things.

768
00:54:08,664 --> 00:54:09,399
Like what?

769
00:54:11,579 --> 00:54:12,975
I need these things.

770
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:18,170
What, you fucking kidding me?

771
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:19,224
What the hell is this?

772
00:54:19,033 --> 00:54:20,458
It's everything I need.

773
00:54:20,459 --> 00:54:23,089
And you might have to screw somebody over
Like, Louie, or somebody.

774
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:24,542
Louie?! Oh whoa, hey, Chris

775
00:54:24,543 --> 00:54:26,102
Or somebody, it doesn't have to be Louie.

776
00:54:26,839 --> 00:54:28,221
-Tony
-Tony

777
00:54:28,757 --> 00:54:29,568
Tony?

778
00:54:29,569 --> 00:54:31,691
I hate Tony -
Hey, fuck Tony he's a scum bag -

779
00:54:32,151 --> 00:54:34,820
I swear, dad. If
you let me do this, it's gonna work.

780
00:54:40,012 --> 00:54:40,774
Tony

781
00:54:41,185 --> 00:54:45,814
Tony Romita, one of America's most wanted crime king-pins
was arrested in Queens today.

782
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:49,263
after a 911 cal from someone claiming to be a superhero

783
00:54:49,263 --> 00:54:51,092
So how are things going with Katie?

784
00:54:52,442 --> 00:54:57,850
Oh, just peachy. Had a sleep over and spent the whole night
watching the entire Ugly Betty box set

785
00:54:57,851 --> 00:54:59,314
and did pedicures.

786
00:54:59,536 --> 00:55:02,663
I'm telling you, though the longer you
wait, the worse it's gonna get.

787
00:55:02,664 --> 00:55:03,765
I know.

788
00:55:04,149 --> 00:55:06,862
I was gonna tell her.
She just seems so... happy.

789
00:55:06,862 --> 00:55:08,888
I don't know whens the right time.
Well, now's your chance.

790
00:55:10,334 --> 00:55:11,207
She seems happy -
Hey guys -

791
00:55:13,116 --> 00:55:14,921
Hi

792
00:55:14,922 --> 00:55:18,309
Oh, did you watch the TV? The new superhero guy? How cool was that?

793
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:19,536
What?

794
00:55:19,537 --> 00:55:21,820
Oooh look. Can you turm it up please?

795
00:55:21,821 --> 00:55:22,995
Check this out.

796
00:55:23,413 --> 00:55:27,751
But it seems that far from being put-off,
this individual, who calls himself Red Mist,

797
00:55:27,752 --> 00:55:31,653
has decided to take crime fighting to a new level,
as his actions last night proved.

798
00:55:32,121 --> 00:55:33,118
Red Mist, how do you see it?

799
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:39,184
Well, I guess folks have just had enough of living in
fear, you know, and uh... Kick-Ass really proved that one individual can make a difference.

800
00:55:39,185 --> 00:55:42,431
So, If anyone out there needs help, I'm gonna be fighting
crime twentyfive/eight.

801
00:55:42,432 --> 00:55:45,039
And I'm just one click away.
RedMist.org.

802
00:55:46,085 --> 00:55:47,934
Can you turn that off now?

803
00:55:48,931 --> 00:55:50,496
What's so special about that guy?

804
00:55:51,035 --> 00:55:53,401
He caught, like, a drug dealer
Some most-wanted guy

805
00:55:53,402 --> 00:55:56,307
He saw 'em bringing out, like, a ton of stuff,
-That's Pretty cool.

806
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,602
Yeah. way better costume than Kickass, too.

807
00:55:59,603 --> 00:56:01,055
He's gotta cape-
Yeah -

808
00:56:01,056 --> 00:56:02,133
Capes rock-
Yeah -

809
00:56:02,134 --> 00:56:04,290
I'm kinda feelin' the cape. Looks good.

810
00:56:05,269 --> 00:56:07,324
What, better than Kick-Ass?

811
00:56:07,972 --> 00:56:10,961
I mean they're both kinda hot I just think that
Red Mist has a better body.

812
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:12,314
Don't you think, Dave?

813
00:56:14,184 --> 00:56:19,169
Yeah Dave what do you think?
Is that the kind of guy you'd go for?
With all that leather?

814
00:56:20,656 --> 00:56:21,667
No, not me.

815
00:56:22,357 --> 00:56:23,426
No, he's not really my type

816
00:57:15,622 --> 00:57:16,426
Kick Ass

817
00:57:17,781 --> 00:57:18,521
Red Mist

818
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:20,635
Oh shit

819
00:57:20,636 --> 00:57:21,966
Fuck me, that kinda hurt.

820
00:57:23,479 --> 00:57:24,285
You OK?

821
00:57:24,286 --> 00:57:25,486

I can't believe you're here, man.

823
00:57:29,411 --> 00:57:32,390
You... inspired me. No Kick-Ass, no
Red Mist.

824
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:34,420
Seriously.

825
00:57:34,421 --> 00:57:35,421
Wow.

826
00:57:34,627 --> 00:57:35,684
Really?

827
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:40,944
Straight up. And listen if you.. I dunno know... if you wanted me to be your sidekick or something like that.....

828
00:57:41,288 --> 00:57:43,007
You wanna be... my sidekick?

829
00:57:43,008 --> 00:57:44,141

835
00:57:59,283 --> 00:58:00,775

Rear view cameras , no big deal.

00:58:52,698 --> 00:58:55,118
Yeah, well "Weed" takes the edge off things when I'm patrol..ya know.

850
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:57,454
Runnin' up against a crowd can
get kinda scary, dont you thimk?

851
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,351
Something wrong?

852
00:59:03,027 --> 00:59:06,282
You're so not how I expected

853
00:59:12,409 --> 00:59:16,804
Oh, I got e-mail from this chick,
she said this guy's been following her
home from work.

854
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,675
I've got her address
and stuff. You wanna check it out?

855
00:59:20,316 --> 00:59:21,321
Sure, why not?

856
00:59:21,605 --> 00:59:22,681
Cool

857
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:31,608
So this chick was totally naked, right?

858
00:59:31,955 --> 00:59:34,343
So I tell her to sit in my lap and talk about the first thing that comes up.

859
00:59:34,344 --> 00:59:35,344
(Chuckling)

860
00:59:45,131 --> 00:59:46,702
Yep.
Let's get the front he's on his way.

861
00:59:47,527 --> 00:59:48,515
Very good.

862
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,399
Don't kill him 'til I get there.

863
00:59:50,661 --> 00:59:51,524
Right

864
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:59,592
Looks like reading all them comics
paid off, huh?

865
00:59:59,984 --> 01:00:01,764
Your boy did good, Frankie.

866
01:00:04,295 --> 01:00:05,863
He's his father's son.

867
01:00:05,864 --> 01:00:15,664
(C'mon now...who do you..who do you..who do you..who do you think you are?.... ha, ha, ha.. bless your soul)

868
01:00:17,235 --> 01:00:18,080

869
01:00:25,281 --> 01:00:43,281
(I think your crazy...I think your crazy...I think your crazy...just like you)

870
01:00:48,769 --> 01:00:50,138
What... the... fuck????

871
01:00:54,097 --> 01:00:55,224
shit

872
01:00:56,917 --> 01:00:58,025
Hey! What are you doing?

873
01:00:58,026 --> 01:00:59,384
There are people in there!

874
01:00:59,386 --> 01:01:02,095
Shouldn't we just call the Fire...

875
01:01:03,884 --> 01:01:07,139
Shit!

876
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:13,610
Mike!

877
01:01:22,070 --> 01:01:22,914
Oh shit.

878
01:01:27,398 --> 01:01:28,314
Red Mist!

879
01:01:40,502 --> 01:01:42,144
Red Mist...can you hear me?!!

880
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:56,085
Red Mist!

881
01:02:33,577 --> 01:02:35,041
We've gotta get the hell out of here!!

882
01:02:35,829 --> 01:02:40,478
Just move your fucking ass!!

883
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:57,526
Shit!!

884
01:02:57,928 --> 01:02:58,798
Did you see those bodies?

885
01:02:58,804 --> 01:02:59,062
Yeah, man.

886
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:03,982
Why'd you save the teddy...?

887
01:03:04,058 --> 01:03:05,773
What?

888
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:07,427
I don't know, man. Come on.

889
01:03:20,982 --> 01:03:21,502
come

890
01:03:22,779 --> 01:03:26,201
What the hell are you doin' Frank? You know I can't be here. What if somebody saw...

891
01:03:26,202 --> 01:03:30,030
That little motherfucker, Kick-Ass, burned down my warehouse and killed my men, Gigante.

892
01:03:30,031 --> 01:03:32,100
Whoa...wait,wait, slow down. Kick-Ass?

893
01:03:32,101 --> 01:03:34,172
You sure? -
You gotta help me, Vic -

894
01:03:34,173 --> 01:03:36,269
My son was there and he's still missing

895
01:03:37,433 --> 01:03:41,297
They're all dead!! Everbody in the warehouse is dead!!

896
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:44,650
Put the gun down, Vic, it's
Chris!

897
01:03:44,962 --> 01:03:46,642
Chris is Red Mist?!

898
01:03:46,643 --> 01:03:49,358
It's not Red Mist you gotta worry
about, it's Kickass!

899
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:51,684
No it's not. Kick-Ass is just some geek!

900
01:03:52,061 --> 01:03:53,186
You don't have to worry about him

901
01:03:53,473 --> 01:03:54,579
You need to watch this!

902
01:03:57,178 --> 01:03:57,950
Why? What does it do?

903
01:03:57,950 --> 01:03:59,136
You're fucking kidding me

904
01:03:59,136 --> 01:04:01,524
What? -
Goddamit, just sit down -

905
01:04:07,144 --> 01:04:08,440
What are you doing?
What the hell is that thing?

906
01:04:08,715 --> 01:04:11,795
You bought this to spy on the nanny
when I was a kid, don't you remember?

907
01:04:12,613 --> 01:04:13,831
Why? You put it in the warehouse?

908
01:04:13,974 --> 01:04:17,087
Yeah. I thought it'd be cool to put the
unmasking of Kick-Ass on the Internet, okay?

909
01:04:18,332 --> 01:04:18,985
Watch.

910
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:32,711
"Let's get the front he's on his way"

911
01:05:49,115 --> 01:05:50,130
Who the hell is this guy?

912
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:52,175
I don't know, Dad

913
01:05:53,169 --> 01:05:57,622
But, Kick-Ass told me we're not the only super heroes in town. Maybe he knows who this guy is.

914
01:05:59,797 --> 01:06:01,390
I want this place locked down.

915
01:06:02,519 --> 01:06:04,915
Nobody comes in, nobody goes out

916
01:06:05,004 --> 01:06:10,635
Not until somebody finds this cocksucker and blows his fuckin' lungs out through his chest.

917
01:06:14,792 --> 01:06:19,538
They're on to you.
did you hear me? They're on to you

918
01:06:19,539 --> 01:06:21,258
I thought they were looking for
Kick-Ass?

919
01:06:21,573 --> 01:06:26,230
Not anymore. Gigante just put on a little movie
show for us. Different Superhero.

920
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:30,660
In a warehouse killing a whole
bunch of D'Amico's guys.

921
01:06:30,297 --> 01:06:31,949
I'm gonna take a wild guess that was you?

922
01:06:33,215 --> 01:06:35,132
-I killed all the cameras.
-Apparently not.

923
01:06:35,685 --> 01:06:38,516
Look bro, you need to get ghost. Hide yourself
quick.

924
01:06:39,011 --> 01:06:40,182
Appreciate it.

925
01:06:44,556 --> 01:06:45,345
Mindy

926
01:06:46,587 --> 01:06:47,993
No more homework, baby doll

927
01:06:49,012 --> 01:06:51,424
It's time
for Frank D'Amico to go bye-bye.

928
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:01,773
X-Men, Fantastic 4

929
01:07:02,237 --> 01:07:04,344
Right now I can't beat the crap out of them.

930
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:06,695
Everything was out of control

931
01:07:06,937 --> 01:07:08,766
I didn't know what the hell to do

932
01:07:09,046 --> 01:07:10,334
You OK, Dave?

933
01:07:10,552 --> 01:07:11,771
You look tired

934
01:07:12,264 --> 01:07:13,455
Gonna have an early night tonight, maybe?

935
01:07:13,456 --> 01:07:15,388
And there was no one I could talk to about it

936
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:16,781
Hello

937
01:07:17,010 --> 01:07:18,981
Yeah...alright, bro.

938
01:07:21,596 --> 01:07:23,008
I never felt more alone

939
01:07:26,953 --> 01:07:29,035
I've always dreamed of being a super hero

940
01:07:29,401 --> 01:07:32,022
But this...was a nightmare

941
01:07:36,508 --> 01:07:39,149
It was time to stop wearing this stupid costume

942
01:07:42,872 --> 01:07:45,217
But there was one last thing I needed it for

943
01:07:47,852 --> 01:07:50,867
What's the difference between Spider-Man and  Peter Parker ?

944
01:07:52,185 --> 01:07:54,366
Spider-Man gets the girl

945
01:08:01,629 --> 01:08:03,174
(Faintly from noise of blowdryer)
Hey-I'm Kick-Ass!

946
01:08:08,483 --> 01:08:09,261
I'm Kick Ass

947
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:10,759
You e-mailed me.
(Screams)

948
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:11,760
Please...
(Screams in pain)

949
01:08:13,570 --> 01:08:14,457
Oh...Fuck!!!!

950
01:08:15,006 --> 01:08:15,683
Oh Fuck!!!!

951
01:08:15,684 --> 01:08:17,474
Fuckin' freak in a mask-fuck!!

952
01:08:17,734 --> 01:08:18,750
Get out of my house

953
01:08:18,930 --> 01:08:19,988
I'm not gonna
hurt you, alright!

954
01:08:20,822 --> 01:08:22,518
No, no, it's me

955
01:08:22,519 --> 01:08:25,440
I was only trying to surprise you
- Dave??!!

956
01:08:25,441 --> 01:08:27,138
Sorry -
What the fuck are you doing?!!

957
01:08:27,661 --> 01:08:28,742
Why are you dressed as Kick-Ass?

958
01:08:28,743 --> 01:08:30,429
Because I am Kick-Ass.

959
01:08:30,430 --> 01:08:31,866
What are you talking about?

960
01:08:31,886 --> 01:08:34,155
And I'm also not gay.

961
01:08:35,258 --> 01:08:35,979
Fuck!!!

962
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:38,871
And I know I've been an idiot,
and a shit friend, I lied to you , I know

963
01:08:38,871 --> 01:08:40,366
Oh my God! -

964
01:08:40,367 --> 01:08:43,433
I know and if it makes you feel any better,
I don't think you could hate me any more
right now

965
01:08:44,059 --> 01:08:45,142
I hate myself.

966
01:08:46,692 --> 01:08:48,172
Please I'm ...

967
01:08:49,108 --> 01:08:51,298
Look, I'm really really sorry

968
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:57,163
I've never met anybody who was as
beautiful and as kind,

969
01:08:57,608 --> 01:08:59,257
and... lovely as you.

970
01:09:02,758 --> 01:09:03,618
You deserve better.

971
01:09:22,270 --> 01:09:23,069
Dave

972
01:09:23,382 --> 01:09:24,249
Yes

973
01:09:25,633 --> 01:09:29,188
My mom has the burglar alarm set
downstairs. You should probably use
the window.

974
01:09:35,455 --> 01:09:36,189
Or

975
01:09:40,729 --> 01:09:42,464
You could just stay.

976
01:09:43,852 --> 01:09:44,862
stay?

977
01:09:46,245 --> 01:09:47,810
Like when we have a sleepover?

978
01:09:54,645 --> 01:09:56,491
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you

979
01:10:28,085 --> 01:10:33,666
We gotta get over the top of it and then into it right in the middle of her.

980
01:10:33,667 --> 01:10:35,130
Daddy, I think I found one.

981
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:38,165
It's perfect. And they can deliver it in
three days...

982
01:10:41,224 --> 01:10:42,410
And it's three
hundred thousand dollars.

983
01:10:42,411 --> 01:10:46,783
Can you think of anything else
you'd rather spend it on?
Oh my Gosh

984
01:10:47,265 --> 01:10:49,234
that is cool!

985
01:10:49,598 --> 01:10:50,525
Yeah.

986
01:10:51,406 --> 01:10:52,354
Add to shopping cart

987
01:10:53,492 --> 01:10:54,079
OK

988
01:10:57,068 --> 01:10:59,813
Out of Kickass and Red Mist, who do
you think would win in a fight?

989
01:11:00,189 --> 01:11:02,286
Why are they fighting?
That seems stupid

990
01:11:03,481 --> 01:11:04,254
What do you think?

991
01:11:04,255 --> 01:11:06,317
I don't know. But I think Kick-Ass is
cuter.

992
01:11:06,818 --> 01:11:07,802
Really?

993
01:11:09,242 --> 01:11:12,257
I, for one, would definitely fuck his
brains out if I got the chance.

994
01:11:14,779 --> 01:11:15,586
You would?

995
01:11:15,587 --> 01:11:16,945
Definitely.

996
01:11:18,917 --> 01:11:20,581
Do you... uh, feel like checking out
that new Kate Hudson movie where...

997
01:11:20,581 --> 01:11:22,313
she's like a shoe designer kind of guy?

998
01:11:22,313 --> 01:11:24,176
I think we can make the next
showing if we leave...

999
01:11:24,176 --> 01:11:24,517
Hell yeah.

1000
01:11:27,993 --> 01:11:29,048
I guess we're not invited

1001
01:11:30,418 --> 01:11:31,928
Alright..you know what, come here

1002
01:11:32,301 --> 01:11:34,436
I'm going to request a great meal for you right now

1003
01:11:35,639 --> 01:11:38,852
Suddenly, I understood why super heroes only exist in the comics

1004
01:11:39,689 --> 01:11:42,216
I doubt why people didn't risk their life for strangers

1005
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:45,063
because, for the first time in my life

1006
01:11:45,064 --> 01:11:46,640
I had something to worth living for

1007
01:11:47,614 --> 01:11:48,889
Something to lose

1008
01:11:51,099 --> 01:11:52,689
Katie was worried about me getting
hurt,

1009
01:11:53,226 --> 01:11:55,397
so I promised her my Kick-Ass
days were over.

1010
01:11:55,398 --> 01:11:57,105
And the truth was,

1011
01:11:57,608 --> 01:11:58,729
I hardly missed it at all.

1012
01:11:59,082 --> 01:12:01,999
I hadn't even checked
the web site for, like, a week.

1013
01:12:05,345 --> 01:12:06,672
Ok ...I'm off then.

1014
01:12:08,213 --> 01:12:08,879
No Katie tonight?

1015
01:12:09,809 --> 01:12:12,629
Tomorrow. Wednesdays she does one
of her volunteer things.

1016
01:12:14,042 --> 01:12:15,626
You seem like a different guy, you
know that?

1017
01:12:16,776 --> 01:12:19,105
Your mom would've been so happy to
see you out of your shell like this.

1018
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:21,491
Have a good night

1019
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:34,374
Hey, baby -
Hi, what's going on? -

1020
01:12:35,570 --> 01:12:37,157
I gotta do that Kick-Ass thing

1021
01:12:37,158 --> 01:12:38,025
What?

1022
01:12:38,264 --> 01:12:39,442
I thought you were done with that?

1023
01:12:39,692 --> 01:12:41,788
This is the last time. I totally
swear...

1024
01:12:43,209 --> 01:12:44,345
I worry about you

1025
01:12:46,103 --> 01:12:47,213
I wish you wouldnt worry.

1026
01:12:47,478 --> 01:12:49,781
I can't help it. I do. Because I...

1027
01:12:51,432 --> 01:12:53,046
I...care about you a lot.

1028
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:58,163
I... care about you a lot, too.

1029
01:13:28,007 --> 01:13:31,766
This better be serious, Dude, because
I promised my girlfriend that I'm done with all this shit.

1030
01:13:31,767 --> 01:13:34,381
How about both of us being dead?
Is that serious enough for you?

1031
01:13:34,878 --> 01:13:35,684
Dead?

1032
01:13:36,704 --> 01:13:37,430
How?

1033
01:13:37,431 --> 01:13:42,499
Well it turns out those dead guys from the warehouse had some bad motherfuckers for friends
and they think we did that shit.

1034
01:13:42,499 --> 01:13:44,290
There's a price on our heads, man.

1035
01:13:44,777 --> 01:13:47,150
A price on our heads? What is this,
the wild west?

1036
01:13:47,150 --> 01:13:52,683
I'm not messing with you, dude!!
They found out where I lived!! They trashed my placed!!!
I'm fucking screwed!!! And you're gonna be next, Okay?!!!!

1037
01:13:52,683 --> 01:13:53,726
Alright.

1038
01:13:56,767 --> 01:13:58,015
Shit

1039
01:13:59,527 --> 01:14:00,394
What do we do?

1040
01:14:03,787 --> 01:14:06,403
Remember you mentioned that there were other super heroes

1041
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:07,739
Yeah.

1042
01:14:08,717 --> 01:14:09,842
Well, do you think they can help us?

1043
01:14:19,366 --> 01:14:21,326
Hot chocolate, extra Marsh-mellows.

1044
01:14:24,106 --> 01:14:26,929
Wow it's even cooler than in the picture

1046
01:14:29,492 --> 01:14:32,561
you know because in the picture
it didn't have Gatling guns

1047
01:14:32,562 --> 01:14:33,232
Nice job.

1048
01:14:34,425 --> 01:14:35,398
I'm gonna get ready for bed, Okay?

1049
01:14:35,399 --> 01:14:36,252
Okay baby doll.

(Beeper)

1051
01:14:39,484 --> 01:14:40,283
Kick-Ass?

1052
01:14:41,472 --> 01:14:43,960
You go get dressed I'l tell him to meet us at safehouse B

1053
01:14:44,219 --> 01:14:45,682
We'll have our hot-chocolate when we get back.-
Okay daddy.

1054
01:14:46,518 --> 01:14:47,152
C'mon.

1055
01:14:57,043 --> 01:14:58,362
No..no

1056
01:14:59,135 --> 01:14:59,896
I got it.

1057
01:14:59,897 --> 01:15:01,055
I'll just put it in the GPS

1058
01:15:02,078 --> 01:15:03,103
Alright, let's go

1059
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:05,631
Shit

1060
01:16:46,246 --> 01:16:47,652
Well

1061
01:16:47,653 --> 01:16:50,741
here you are, and Red Mist, too.

1062
01:16:56,607 --> 01:16:58,113
Pleasure to meet you.

1063
01:16:58,114 --> 01:16:59,282
Good to meet you sir.

1064
01:16:59,398 --> 01:17:00,722
Please, come in

1065
01:17:01,749 --> 01:17:02,397
After you

1066
01:17:06,055 --> 01:17:07,809
Hit Girl , manners..honey.

1067
01:17:10,596 --> 01:17:11,577
Hi, I'm Hit Girl

1068
01:17:13,445 --> 01:17:14,928
No!!!!!

1069
01:17:22,624 --> 01:17:24,390
Hey he's with me, he's O.K.!
Shut the fuck up, kid!!!

1070
01:17:24,391 --> 01:17:27,007
Your daddy's the boss!! You don't order shit!!

1071
01:17:27,008 --> 01:17:27,770
Shit! No!..........

1072
01:17:28,355 --> 01:17:29,573
He's with me!!!!..........

1073
01:17:29,848 --> 01:17:31,145
Let him go!!!.........

1074
01:17:31,378 --> 01:17:33,005
Get outta here, get the fuck outta here

1075
01:17:33,489 --> 01:17:35,120
Hotdamn, I always wanted one of these..........

1076
01:17:35,121 --> 01:17:35,972
Seriously you're gonna take that? -
Yes -

1077
01:17:42,552 --> 01:17:44,103
You know what being a super hero actually costs?
You happen to be in a lot of trouble here.

1078
01:17:45,094 --> 01:17:51,070
Kick-Ass!!-
Get em outta here!!-

1079
01:17:51,293 --> 01:17:52,533
Kick Ass  I'm sorry

1080
01:17:54,565 --> 01:17:55,259
Get in there

1081
01:18:08,012 --> 01:18:09,266
You better fire this asshole!!

1082
01:18:10,258 --> 01:18:11,021
Ignore him.

1083
01:18:12,176 --> 01:18:13,662
A Bazooka?

1084
01:18:16,282 --> 01:18:17,126
OK

1085
01:18:17,543 --> 01:18:20,989
We had a deal, dad. We had a fucking deal
that would get you the guy who did it.

1086
01:18:20,991 --> 01:18:24,265
All I'm asking is you let Kick-Ass go! He didn't do
anything wrong!

1087
01:18:24,553 --> 01:18:26,827
Chris, you gotta look at this from my point of view, Okay?

1088
01:18:28,242 --> 01:18:30,959
I gotta send a public service
message to the people out there

1089
01:18:31,226 --> 01:18:33,714
that being a superhero is
bad for your health.

1090
01:18:33,715 --> 01:18:36,343
And the big motherfucker? Nobody knows who he is.

1091
01:18:36,344 --> 01:18:37,434
Yeah, but that's not fair!

1092
01:18:37,434 --> 01:18:39,061
Life's not fair, kid. Get over it.

1093
01:18:39,559 --> 01:18:40,744
What are you gonna do with them?

1094
01:18:42,063 --> 01:18:44,194
You really want to be a part of my business?

1095
01:18:47,122 --> 01:18:47,838
Yeah.

1096
01:18:47,839 --> 01:18:49,886
Then sit down, shut up

1097
01:18:50,318 --> 01:18:51,218
and watch.

1098
01:18:59,717 --> 01:19:00,880
Frank , we're ready

1099
01:19:02,059 --> 01:19:02,836
Enjoy the show

1100
01:19:02,837 --> 01:19:04,017
You patched-up with this thing?

1101
01:19:04,017 --> 01:19:05,702
I sure am big brother.

1102
01:19:06,026 --> 01:19:07,140
Watch and learn

1103
01:19:07,392 --> 01:19:13,082
Welcome back to breaking news a world wide web broadcast of the
New York superhero who calls himself Kick-Ass.

1104
01:19:13,083 --> 01:19:20,366
is about to be shown live. Rumors have it that this will be
Kick-Ass' farewell appearance that he will announce his retirement from
crime fighting

1105
01:19:20,662 --> 01:19:27,503
but as word-of-mouth continues to spread, internet
providers are predicting that it could be one of the
most widely viewed live events in web history.

1106
01:19:28,684 --> 01:19:30,041
Hey, where's Dave ?

1107
01:19:31,410 --> 01:19:33,523
Hey have you guys noticed -
He's with Katie...

1108
01:19:34,165 --> 01:19:35,148
obviously.

1109
01:19:35,656 --> 01:19:37,304
Why else would I be here?

1110
01:19:38,046 --> 01:19:40,784
With no idea as to who is behind the broadcast of this show

1111
01:19:41,105 --> 01:19:44,587
But we could see wide spread server crashes

1112
01:19:44,588 --> 01:19:47,538
Dave, why didn't you tell this is what you were doing.
You're on the news.

1113
01:19:47,984 --> 01:19:48,687
Call me

1114
01:19:48,688 --> 01:19:51,615
We go now over live to the countdown clock as we are moments away.

1115
01:20:03,735 --> 01:20:04,403
Showtime

1116
01:20:07,015 --> 01:20:13,010
Hello boys and girls, now this...uh...
well you know who this guy is.

1117
01:20:13,763 --> 01:20:15,992
And...uh...this guy here is Big Daddy

1118
01:20:16,802 --> 01:20:18,782
And these are my friends.

1119
01:20:18,783 --> 01:20:20,073
Come on in guys say hello

1120
01:20:20,931 --> 01:20:21,631
Yeah.

1121
01:20:21,806 --> 01:20:23,733
Yeah there they are
Hello, Hello

1122
01:20:24,263 --> 01:20:26,532
Now Big Daddy and Kick-Ass

1123
01:20:26,533 --> 01:20:31,826
are gonna help us show you why
being a hero is a bad idea.

1124
01:20:32,138 --> 01:20:33,877
You know what a silent "K" is?

1125
01:20:34,458 --> 01:20:37,458
That's when "K" is at the beginning of the but you don't pronounce it

1126
01:20:37,459 --> 01:20:39,153
like in the word knuckle duster

1127
01:20:39,154 --> 01:20:40,929
Show them what knuckle duster can do, Guy.

1128
01:20:40,930 --> 01:20:43,030
Oh that must've hurt.

1129
01:20:43,153 --> 01:20:44,592
Let's see that again on the other side, go.

1130
01:20:45,269 --> 01:20:46,780
Oh Yeah, look at this

1131
01:20:47,101 --> 01:20:50,071
Now in France they say the word stick like this...

1132
01:20:50,072 --> 01:20:51,459
Ba-ton

1133
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:54,278
We have some of Kick-Ass' batons.
We're gonna show you what they can do.

1134
01:20:54,279 --> 01:20:55,391
Go ahead boys.

1135
01:20:59,207 --> 01:21:00,766
In America we say stick like this...

1136
01:21:01,145 --> 01:21:02,547
Baseball Bat

1137
01:21:03,792 --> 01:21:04,885
For hittin' knees..

1138
01:21:05,271 --> 01:21:06,632
hands...

1139
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:09,886
It's also good for hittin' balls.

1140
01:21:11,273 --> 01:21:14,896
We don't do 'em individually, we do 'em all together.

1141
01:21:15,409 --> 01:21:16,581
Gentlemen please. Yeah.

1142
01:21:17,624 --> 01:21:18,902
Oh this looks very painful..........

1143
01:21:22,914 --> 01:21:28,536
Due to the distressing nature of the images we are unable to
broadcast the events currently streaming live on the Internet

1144
01:21:29,956 --> 01:21:30,913
No No

1145
01:21:33,235 --> 01:21:39,889
Misguided miscalculations suggest that this may be some kind of hoax or publicity
stunt. It is now clear that the hostages are in genuine danger

1146
01:21:39,889 --> 01:21:44,720
That all signs point to the intentions to stage
a live execution in the next few minutes

1147
01:21:57,911 --> 01:22:01,134
Even with my metal plates and my
fucked up nerve endings,

1148
01:22:01,475 --> 01:22:02,796
I've gotta tell ya,

1149
01:22:02,796 --> 01:22:04,281
that hurt.

1150
01:22:07,095 --> 01:22:09,655
the silent killer

1151
01:22:09,655 --> 01:22:12,734
But not half as much as the idea of
leaving everything behind.

1152
01:22:13,777 --> 01:22:14,616
Katie

1153
01:22:15,401 --> 01:22:16,099
My dad.

1154
01:22:16,903 --> 01:22:17,704
Todd and Marty

1155
01:22:18,299 --> 01:22:20,010
And all the
things I'd never do.

1156
01:22:20,871 --> 01:22:22,820
Like learn to drive.

1157
01:22:23,028 --> 01:22:25,233
Or see what me and Katie's
kids would look like.

1158
01:22:25,624 --> 01:22:27,540
Or find out
what happened on Lost.

1159
01:22:28,929 --> 01:22:32,833
And if you're reassuring yourself that I'm gonna make it through this since I'm talking to you now,

1160
01:22:34,446 --> 01:22:36,123
quit being such a smart ass.

1161
01:22:36,537 --> 01:22:39,128
Hell dude. You've never seen Sin City?

1162
01:22:39,129 --> 01:22:41,974
Sunset Boulevard? American Beauty?

1163
01:22:42,887 --> 01:22:48,718
And this,...for all you brave men out there...
is fire.

1164
01:22:57,833 --> 01:22:59,288
Fire, Fire's good

1165
01:23:00,759 --> 01:23:02,698
Fire is our friend

1166
01:23:11,063 --> 01:23:11,953
Gentlemen

1167
01:23:14,148 --> 01:23:15,416
Time to die.

1168
01:23:21,623 --> 01:23:22,205
What the...

1169
01:24:19,005 --> 01:24:20,027
Find me a lighter

1170
01:24:29,473 --> 01:24:30,059
I've got it

1171
01:24:44,218 --> 01:24:44,799
No!!!!!!!

1172
01:24:44,799 --> 01:24:46,635
Take cover, child!!!!!!!!!!

1173
01:24:52,281 --> 01:24:55,842
Now switch to Kryptonite!!!!!!!

1174
01:25:25,575 --> 01:25:27,677
Eject, 2 rounds and relay!!!!!!

1175
01:26:14,190 --> 01:26:16,004
Show's over mother-fuckers.

1176
01:26:21,129 --> 01:26:21,934
Yeah!!!

1177
01:26:21,935 --> 01:26:23,376
I think I'm in love with her, dude.

1178
01:26:24,573 --> 01:26:26,229
She looks like she's about 11 years old, but...

1179
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:29,270
I can wait. I solemnly vow to save myself for her.

1180
01:26:30,878 --> 01:26:32,409
I can see that this can be really difficult for you.

1181
01:26:32,853 --> 01:26:33,662
Are you OK?

1182
01:26:34,330 --> 01:26:34,950
Yeah.-
Whoa-

1183
01:26:53,797 --> 01:26:54,871
Good job.

1184
01:27:03,329 --> 01:27:05,446
I'm so proud of you, baby doll

1185
01:27:08,081 --> 01:27:09,117
Are you OK?

1186
01:27:12,599 --> 01:27:13,447
Yes

1187
01:27:15,235 --> 01:27:18,198
Getting shot, daddy, hurt a lot more than when you did it.

1188
01:27:19,947 --> 01:27:23,370
That's because I used low-velocity rounds, child.

1189
01:27:28,224 --> 01:27:29,875
You're the kindest daddy in the whole world

1190
01:27:30,748 --> 01:27:31,618
I just....

1191
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:36,017
I love you

1192
01:27:41,353 --> 01:27:42,428
I love you too daddy

1193
01:27:50,911 --> 01:27:51,718
I love you, dad

1194
01:27:53,693 --> 01:27:54,460
good night

1195
01:28:13,506 --> 01:28:14,337
What's your name?

1196
01:28:15,778 --> 01:28:16,737
I mean, your real name

1197
01:28:17,255 --> 01:28:20,118
A super hero never reveals her true
identity.

1198
01:28:20,119 --> 01:28:23,419
What look, you can't go on...

1199
01:28:24,309 --> 01:28:26,088
However you
lived before.............

1200
01:28:29,990 --> 01:28:30,862
It's over.

1201
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:34,605
Is there anybody else?

1202
01:28:34,893 --> 01:28:36,141
Any other family, or?

1203
01:28:36,142 --> 01:28:37,451
I can take care of myself.

1204
01:28:39,140 --> 01:28:40,624
I saved your sorry ass!

1205
01:28:41,577 --> 01:28:42,684
what about money?

1206
01:28:43,566 --> 01:28:45,487
Alright, cause you've got to think long-term

1207
01:28:45,488 --> 01:28:47,852
I've got three million dollars in a
suitcase!

1208
01:28:49,092 --> 01:28:50,817
That long-term
enough for ya?

1209
01:28:54,058 --> 01:28:55,478
It's not all about the money,

1210
01:28:57,239 --> 01:28:58,335
I owe you

1211
01:29:00,067 --> 01:29:01,556
If not for you, I'd be dead.

1212
01:29:03,347 --> 01:29:04,823
if it wasn't for you

1213
01:29:06,691 --> 01:29:07,948
my dad wouldnt be.

1214
01:29:24,699 --> 01:29:25,918
Look

1215
01:29:26,501 --> 01:29:29,842
pack up whatever you
need and we'll go back to my place.

1216
01:29:32,430 --> 01:29:33,297
I just need to clean up, I think?

1217
01:30:28,322 --> 01:30:30,933
Woah. I meant, like pajamas

1218
01:30:31,059 --> 01:30:32,477
and clothes and stuff. You can't take that stuff to my house.

1219
01:30:32,713 --> 01:30:34,219
You know what my dad would have really
wanted?

1220
01:30:39,980 --> 01:30:41,984
He would have wanted me to
finish what we started.

1221
01:30:43,847 --> 01:30:45,239
And that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

1222
01:31:02,157 --> 01:31:03,906
Is this Frank D'Amico's place?

1223
01:31:04,463 --> 01:31:05,946
All that security

1224
01:31:06,983 --> 01:31:08,184
Are you crazy?

1225
01:31:08,417 --> 01:31:10,434
My mom already died for nothing.

1226
01:31:11,571 --> 01:31:14,087
So, I'm sure as hell not gonna let my dad die for
nothing too.

1227
01:31:16,811 --> 01:31:18,165
You can't do this on your own.

1228
01:31:20,623 --> 01:31:21,401
Exactly

1229
01:31:24,315 --> 01:31:25,725
You wanna deal with owing
my dad?

1230
01:31:28,029 --> 01:31:30,187
Then shut the hell up and
pick your weapon.

1231
01:31:38,990 --> 01:31:40,371
Is that what I think it is?

1232
01:31:41,781 --> 01:31:42,881
Damn straight.

1233
01:31:44,228 --> 01:31:48,386
Oh you better start reading the instructions,
'cause you're gonna be using it in about five minutes.

1234
01:31:55,974 --> 01:31:59,108
Yo listen up, you've got 5 minutes and
I want you back on your post

1235
01:31:59,108 --> 01:32:00,935
and don't leave a mess

1236
01:32:14,985 --> 01:32:15,798
Everything okay?

1237
01:32:15,799 --> 01:32:16,782
Things alright, boss

1238
01:32:19,516 --> 01:32:20,644
Can't believe I got my gun back

1239
01:32:20,645 --> 01:32:21,678
Look at that

1240
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:22,930
You know it's not that..
(Knocking)

1241
01:32:27,487 --> 01:32:28,093
Let her in

1242
01:32:31,877 --> 01:32:32,650
That's a little kid

1243
01:32:32,854 --> 01:32:33,872
What's the matter with you?

1244
01:32:38,886 --> 01:32:39,695
You okay, sweetheart?

1245
01:32:40,569 --> 01:32:44,373
No, I lost my mommy and daddy.

1246
01:32:44,630 --> 01:32:46,153
she lost her mommy and daddy

1247
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:48,856
You wanna use my cell phone?

1248
01:32:50,851 --> 01:32:51,852
Now can you remember the number?

1249
01:33:35,112 --> 01:33:36,888
Had I ever been a real superhero?

1250
01:33:38,148 --> 01:33:43,888
The most I'd ever had to offer the world was good
intentions and a slightly elevated capacity to
take a kicking.

1251
01:33:45,688 --> 01:33:49,059
With no power comes no
responsibility.

1252
01:33:50,189 --> 01:33:51,245
Except

1253
01:33:52,343 --> 01:33:53,259
that wasn't true.

1254
01:34:40,700 --> 01:34:41,522
shit

1255
01:36:19,143 --> 01:36:21,125
Hey I'm in here come help me out!!!!!!!!!

1256
01:36:25,929 --> 01:36:27,990
Wait, fuck this!! And, everybody's dead!!!

1257
01:36:30,498 --> 01:36:32,612
She's behind the counter, she's out of ammo.

1258
01:36:47,449 --> 01:36:48,632
Do you think they got her?

1259
01:36:49,601 --> 01:36:50,764
If they didn't he will.

1260
01:36:52,494 --> 01:36:53,526
Get out there

1261
01:36:54,421 --> 01:36:54,953
Now?

1262
01:36:54,988 --> 01:36:56,099
Yeah, now

1263
01:37:06,797 --> 01:37:07,818
What the fuck is going on?

1264
01:37:07,818 --> 01:37:09,597
We got her trapped she's still alive

1265
01:37:09,598 --> 01:37:11,308
So what the hell you guys waiting for?

1266
01:37:12,484 --> 01:37:13,110
Go get her-
Go ahead-.

1267
01:37:13,353 --> 01:37:16,397
I only got one fucking gun. I'm not going in there.

1268
01:37:18,394 --> 01:37:20,015
Do it now

1269
01:37:21,564 --> 01:37:22,263
Come on

1270
01:37:41,772 --> 01:37:42,694
Fuck this shit.

1271
01:37:42,861 --> 01:37:44,223
I'm getting the Bazooka

1272
01:37:47,378 --> 01:37:48,169
Bazooka?

1273
01:37:48,586 --> 01:37:49,681
Bazooka

1274
01:37:50,522 --> 01:37:53,070
Whoa hold it. It's only me boss. Everything is under control.

1275
01:38:05,571 --> 01:38:08,831
Under control?
You're grabbing a fucking Bazooka you dumb ass.

1276
01:38:10,945 --> 01:38:14,490
Sir? -
Do it -

1277
01:38:35,035 --> 01:38:37,088
I always wanted to say this...

1278
01:38:39,618 --> 01:38:41,848
say Hello to my little friend

1279
01:39:12,540 --> 01:39:14,058
(Glory, Glory Halleluah song in background)

1280
01:39:38,644 --> 01:39:39,827
Holy shit

1281
01:39:47,892 --> 01:39:49,644
That is one weird sounding Bazooka

1282
01:39:49,644 --> 01:39:50,608
Stu!

1283
01:39:56,814 --> 01:39:57,231
Fuck!

1284
01:40:06,497 --> 01:40:08,030
Get out

1285
01:40:17,529 --> 01:40:18,611
Play time's over, kid.

1286
01:40:19,003 --> 01:40:21,904
I never play

1287
01:40:23,101 --> 01:40:23,933
Oh really?

1288
01:41:38,623 --> 01:41:40,458
Ruin my business, Huh?

1289
01:41:42,168 --> 01:41:44,834
I'll kill every single fucking guy or gal in my way

1290
01:42:13,287 --> 01:42:15,782
I wish my son was just like you.

1291
01:42:22,182 --> 01:42:23,915
It is time for family reunion

1292
01:42:25,835 --> 01:42:26,377
Hey

1293
01:42:27,563 --> 01:42:29,040
Why don't you pick on someone
your own size.

1294
01:42:48,630 --> 01:42:49,418
You Ok?

1295
01:42:50,106 --> 01:42:50,914
Yeah

1296
01:42:52,254 --> 01:42:53,234
Time to go home

1297
01:44:26,534 --> 01:44:27,551
Thanks, Kick-Ass.

1298
01:44:27,875 --> 01:44:29,101
My daddy....

1299
01:44:32,193 --> 01:44:33,518
He would have
been proud of both of us.

1300
01:44:43,981 --> 01:44:45,177
Dave

1301
01:44:46,254 --> 01:44:47,134
Dave Lizewski.

1302
01:44:48,108 --> 01:44:49,247
I know that, dumbass

1303
01:45:00,258 --> 01:45:01,124
Mindy

1304
01:45:02,831 --> 01:45:03,772
Mindy MacReady

1305
01:45:21,233 --> 01:45:22,153
Bye

1306
01:45:24,355 --> 01:45:27,446
Mindy moved in with Marcus
and he enrolled her at my school

1307
01:45:27,447 --> 01:45:28,700
Bye -
Good luck -

1308
01:45:30,214 --> 01:45:31,371
first school she'd ever been to

1309
01:45:31,539 --> 01:45:33,188
on the promise that I'd look out for her.

1310
01:45:35,168 --> 01:45:35,989
Hey

1311
01:45:36,215 --> 01:45:37,268
"Not that she needed me too".

1312
01:45:37,570 --> 01:45:38,509
Hey. New kid.

1313
01:45:38,918 --> 01:45:39,798
Hi

1314
01:45:40,868 --> 01:45:41,525
Lunch money.

1315
01:45:42,798 --> 01:45:43,335
Now.

1316
01:45:43,336 --> 01:45:44,336
(The screams of the two bully's getting their ass kicked)

1317
01:45:51,507 --> 01:45:53,752
Kick-Ass was gone,
but not forgotten.

1318
01:45:55,140 --> 01:45:57,799
And my world is much safer
with all the new superheroes.

1319
01:45:59,245 --> 01:46:00,987
They said I was their inspiration

1320
01:46:01,798 --> 01:46:05,726
But all I did was make a door into a world
I dreamed about, since I was little kid.

1321
01:46:07,051 --> 01:46:09,203
A world full of super heroes, huh?

1322
01:46:11,677 --> 01:46:13,191
like a great man once said...

1323
01:46:16,065 --> 01:46:18,160
Wait'll they get a load of me.
