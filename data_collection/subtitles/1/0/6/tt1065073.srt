1
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,071
Are you ready, honey?
#Yes.

2
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:38,961
- Guess what, Mom.
- What?
#I found out where the wasps.

3
00:01:38,986 --> 00:01:40,074
Where?

4
00:01:40,529 --> 00:01:44,127
Well, it has to be ...
If you throw a moth to the air,

5
00:01:44,152 --> 00:01:46,878
turn it into a wasp.

6
00:01:47,303 --> 00:01:49,960
- Good!
- Yes.

7
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,323
- How was school?
- All right.

8
00:01:54,595 --> 00:01:58,671
I had a meeting with Miss. Butler.
I liked him.
#Say what?

9
00:01:58,796 --> 00:02:02,160
He said no entregabas your tasks.

10
00:02:02,185 --> 00:02:05,459
I said, "I know that makes
the control it every night. "

11
00:02:05,484 --> 00:02:09,231
He said he found several
jobs at the bottom of your backpack.

12
00:02:09,256 --> 00:02:11,117
He asked me not!

13
00:02:11,142 --> 00:02:14,369
Do not have to.
You just have to deliver.

14
00:02:14,494 --> 00:02:17,626
And told me that you keep looking
the window throughout the day.

15
00:02:18,424 --> 00:02:23,074
Not all day!
#And you destroyed your sharpener.

16
00:02:24,088 --> 00:02:27,755
It was not on purpose!
#And several stones You stuck inside.

17
00:02:28,212 --> 00:02:31,765
I thought if sharpened pencils
I could also sharpening stones.

18
00:02:33,085 --> 00:02:36,074
What would you do
with sharp stones?

19
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:39,319
I wanted to make heads
arrow for my collection.

20
00:03:02,314 --> 00:03:04,820
- Touch Me!
- Wait.

21
00:03:17,327 --> 00:03:19,424
<I> Mason </ i>

22
00:03:20,914 --> 00:03:22,040
Samantha!

23
00:03:22,865 --> 00:03:27,057
Tommy! Mason is there?
#Yes.

24
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:30,879
- Tell him he has to come to dinner.
- OK.

25
00:03:44,647 --> 00:03:48,100
- Hi.
- Hello, gorgeous.
#Why are not you ready?

26
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,853
Hello, Mason!
#Hi, Tim.

27
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:55,782
- Hurry up, come on.
- What time is it?
#The nine! Come on!

28
00:03:55,807 --> 00:03:59,147
I wanted to tell you that Janice
I failed. I have no babysitter.

29
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:03,158
Why do not you call another?
#I can not get  one now. It is nine.

30
00:04:03,183 --> 00:04:05,334
But you can stay with us.

31
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:08,190
No! We had plans.
Your friends are waiting for me.

32
00:04:09,145 --> 00:04:13,731
- Well, you see.
- Okay.
#Back in a couple of hours.

33
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:18,905
Is it okay?
#. Yeah, it's all good.

34
00:04:23,753 --> 00:04:27,179
"Back! Back!
I do not want to talk to Margo Money! "

35
00:04:27,204 --> 00:04:29,590
"Who? Harry said as
hurried retreat. "

36
00:04:29,615 --> 00:04:34,172
"Haunts one of the toilets
in the girls' bathroom, Hermione said. "

37
00:04:34,197 --> 00:04:35,950
"Haunts a toilet?"

38
00:04:36,211 --> 00:04:40,011
"Yes, it has been out of service
all year because she gets mad ...

39
00:04:40,036 --> 00:04:43,919
"And inundates everything"
"Just never go there  if I can help it. "

40
00:04:43,944 --> 00:04:46,728
"It's horrible trying to do
pee while she yells at you! "

41
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:51,068
<I> Why did you say that? </ I>
<I> - I'm sorry.  -'re Sorry. Lying. </ I>

42
00:04:51,093 --> 00:04:52,640
<I> I wanted to stay here with my children ... </ i>

43
00:04:52,665 --> 00:04:55,718
<I> Stop using children as an excuse </ i>

44
00:04:55,743 --> 00:04:58,238
<I> I know you like to stay here.
It is not necessary that ... </ i>

45
00:04:58,263 --> 00:04:59,454
<I> do not know anything! </ I>

46
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:02,235
<I> have no responsibilities! </ I>

47
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,130
<I> I the I have. Do not know
what it means to be a father. </ i>

48
00:05:06,155 --> 00:05:09,342
<I> do not know! And why I am
responsible for your mistakes in life </ i>

49
00:05:09,367 --> 00:05:13,198
Errors not call my kids!
#I did not say them ...!

50
00:05:13,223 --> 00:05:17,410
- You said "your mistakes" ...
- I know what I said.
#You use them again.

51
00:05:17,435 --> 00:05:19,474
<I> is the reality! I'm a mother! </ I>

52
00:05:19,499 --> 00:05:24,483
<I> Y means responsibility. I
love to have time to myself </ i>

53
00:05:24,508 --> 00:05:27,629
I would love to go see
a fucking movie! Do not you think?

54
00:05:27,654 --> 00:05:31,335
Dining out. Go to a bar.
#He did not even know how!

55
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,383
She was the daughter of someone,
and now I'm somebody's mother!

56
00:05:34,408 --> 00:05:36,099
Do you understand? I do not know how that is!

57
00:05:38,761 --> 00:05:40,824
"I think I did it again,

58
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:43,969
"I played with your heart I
I lost the game. "

59
00:05:43,994 --> 00:05:47,582
"Oh baby, baby
Oops! ... You thought I was in love,

60
00:05:47,607 --> 00:05:52,568
"That had been sent from above,
- Enough!  - "I'm not that innocent."

61
00:05:53,295 --> 00:05:56,496
Enough!
#"You see my problem is this.  I'm dreaming. "

62
00:05:56,521 --> 00:05:59,321
- "Wishing that heroes exist."
- Enough!

63
00:05:59,346 --> 00:06:03,866
I cry, watching the days.
Am I a fool in so many ways "

64
00:06:06,127 --> 00:06:09,660
What's going on?
#You know what time it is?

65
00:06:09,685 --> 00:06:12,459
He is ... throwing things!

66
00:06:13,518 --> 00:06:18,470
Mason! Do not throw things at your sister.
#Lie. She hit me first.

67
00:06:18,495 --> 00:06:19,656
Listen to them both!

68
00:06:19,781 --> 00:06:23,693
I'm going back to bed. I do not want to hear
no sound here for over an hour.

69
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:24,748
A sleep!

70
00:06:28,648 --> 00:06:30,096
- False!
- Hey!

71
00:06:46,592 --> 00:06:48,742
Look what I found on the street.

72
00:06:53,467 --> 00:06:56,615
It's good, right?
#Look at these!

73
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,208
Oops! Look at these!

74
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:22,389
Well, listen ...
#I want to talk about something, and ...

75
00:07:22,414 --> 00:07:25,854
might not like it
the idea at first, but ...
#moved to Houston.

76
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,451
When?

77
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:32,181
Soon. We should do before
first to avoid paying two rents.

78
00:07:32,206 --> 00:07:36,055
No, Mom, not moved.
No, no. I'm sorry, Mom. No, no.

79
00:07:37,306 --> 00:07:41,332
Samantha, I need to return to the
university to improve our lives.

80
00:07:41,357 --> 00:07:46,195
With my job I can not
support the family as I want.
#I can not go on.

81
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:50,326
And grandma will help us.
#It will be good to be around her.

82
00:07:50,351 --> 00:07:54,975
Well, Mom. You can do what
anytime. But we are not moved.

83
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,127
What about our friends?

84
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:02,956
We will e-mail or letter.
We can go back to visit.

85
00:08:04,003 --> 00:08:08,487
And guess? The place we found
Grandma will own rooms.

86
00:08:09,145 --> 00:08:12,537
What's up?
#And there's a pool.

87
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:17,091
Mom, do you still love daddy?

88
00:08:18,723 --> 00:08:20,615
I still love your father.

89
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:25,108
But that does not mean
had been healthy to stay together.

90
00:08:25,933 --> 00:08:30,587
What if, after the move,
he can not find us?

91
00:08:31,112 --> 00:08:35,809
It will not be a problem.
#You can call grandma.

92
00:08:35,834 --> 00:08:40,023
Or call number information.
#We will be easy to find.

93
00:08:40,048 --> 00:08:44,656
Are you still in Alaska?
#Thus says your uncle.

94
00:08:45,369 --> 00:08:47,353
Taming polar bears or something.

95
00:08:48,632 --> 00:08:51,024
I hope the bears tamed him.

96
00:08:52,672 --> 00:08:54,456
FURNITURE MOVING AND STORAGE

97
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:06,022
- Here. Want to help?
- Clear.

98
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:09,504
Take up painting ...
carefully ...

99
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:13,422
paints and stains, marks or points ...

100
00:09:13,447 --> 00:09:18,031
in the socket, behind the door ...
#and the entire inner portion of the inlet.

101
00:09:19,863 --> 00:09:23,925
He says he will come to visit.
#I will write and call you.

102
00:09:25,521 --> 00:09:28,609
Wait a second.
There is a call on the other line.

103
00:09:29,393 --> 00:09:30,602
Hello?

104
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:35,114
Sorry, Tommy. Mason not
You can go today. We're moving.

105
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:37,795
I'm on the other line. Bye Bye.

106
00:09:39,193 --> 00:09:40,234
Sofia?

107
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,728
I'll send you instructions
for scouts.

108
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:48,408
Respond and tell me how
are the other scouts.

109
00:09:49,814 --> 00:09:51,894
Because now you're the principal.

110
00:09:54,054 --> 00:09:56,822
Come on. I want to get
before dark.

111
00:09:57,413 --> 00:10:01,032
Goodbye garden!
Goodbye bushes! Goodbye mailbox!

112
00:10:01,057 --> 00:10:05,273
Goodbye box of stuff mom
not let us go and do not want to shoot.

113
00:10:05,298 --> 00:10:09,486
Goodbye house. I will never love you Mom
as before for making us move!

114
00:10:09,511 --> 00:10:13,814
Samantha! Why do not you say goodbye
Also that shitty attitude?

115
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,701
Do not take a car ride.

116
00:10:15,726 --> 00:10:19,736
Goodbye old lady listening
rock music motorbike and walk.

117
00:10:46,822 --> 00:10:50,039
What about the back?
Enough! Put separation.

118
00:10:52,592 --> 00:10:56,095
Put a pillow between them.
Make a barrier. And that's enough.

119
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,376
We'll play something called
"The game of silence."

120
00:10:59,501 --> 00:11:03,122
Which is
more quiet time wins.

121
00:11:03,447 --> 00:11:05,223
You think you can do?

122
00:11:06,861 --> 00:11:07,814
<I> Come on! </ I>

123
00:11:34,218 --> 00:11:35,962
The bus will arrive in ten minutes.

124
00:11:37,289 --> 00:11:39,302
Put those duties in the backpack.

125
00:11:41,223 --> 00:11:42,852
Eat!

126
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:50,174
Honey, go eat!
#I am going!

127
00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:08,522
Speak English!
#Shut up!

128
00:12:08,547 --> 00:12:12,431
Mom! He's talking
language that stupid again.
#Samantha!

129
00:12:12,456 --> 00:12:17,392
He spoke very clear English, mother.
#You know it's a little slow head.

130
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:21,597
Officially flunked first grade.
- Support your butt.  - Aye, sir mother!

131
00:12:21,622 --> 00:12:26,433
Well, I want you to listen.
#Grandma's going to find a school.

132
00:12:26,502 --> 00:12:29,741
His father came for the day.
They will spend the afternoon with him.

133
00:12:29,766 --> 00:12:32,914
Will you come to live here?
#I do not know.

134
00:12:32,939 --> 00:12:35,284
Eight years ago have not seen him.

135
00:12:36,331 --> 00:12:37,765
Moreover guy ... year and a half.

136
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:42,681
Please.
#Can you eat?  The bus is coming.

137
00:12:42,906 --> 00:12:46,472
Anyone want syrup?
#That! Good italics.

138
00:12:48,575 --> 00:12:51,775
Well, Mason. When controlling
modules, will I find yours?

139
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,303
- No.
- Why not?
#For I have not finished.

140
00:12:55,726 --> 00:12:58,551
It's time to end it.
#Minute!

141
00:13:13,072 --> 00:13:16,336
Time to finish your work, Mason!
#Apple, quit!

142
00:13:22,773 --> 00:13:24,702
<I> This is my history test. </ I>

143
00:13:26,426 --> 00:13:27,856
<I> Ten congratulated, great! </ I>

144
00:13:29,464 --> 00:13:32,363
<I> And this is another history test </ i>
<I> And another "ten." </ I>

145
00:13:32,388 --> 00:13:34,781
There is congratulated. Tough.

146
00:13:34,806 --> 00:13:39,659
And that's my report ... lizards.
#Let me see your drawings.

147
00:13:39,684 --> 00:13:43,320
Right. These are my drawings.
- What's that?  - His name is Gill.

148
00:13:43,345 --> 00:13:47,173
- Gill?
- Yes.
#And this is the math test.

149
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:50,910
Ten again?
#Mason! That was  the last candy, right?

150
00:13:50,935 --> 00:13:54,227
It's okay.
#When you show things ...

151
00:13:56,251 --> 00:13:57,310
It is he.

152
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:09,171
OMG!
#They're so big!

153
00:14:09,357 --> 00:14:12,676
All right, buddy?
Do they want to have fun?

154
00:14:15,033 --> 00:14:19,990
- Catherine, how are you?
- All right.
#I'm glad. What time should I bring?

155
00:14:20,015 --> 00:14:24,992
I'd say at 7:30.
I must take them home.
#Why not take  I to him from his mother?

156
00:14:25,936 --> 00:14:30,633
She expects me.
#No problem.  You know get, right?

157
00:14:30,658 --> 00:14:34,035
I will. No problem.
- Not a good idea.  - No problem. OK?

158
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:38,564
Are you ready?
#Just a moment!  They have to carry your things.

159
00:14:39,489 --> 00:14:43,013
Your backpack, your purse.
The task. Go to the bathroom.

160
00:14:43,338 --> 00:14:47,351
Amazing how they have grown!
#Time passes.

161
00:14:50,577 --> 00:14:53,241
We should like to have them here in Houston.

162
00:14:53,358 --> 00:14:58,285
I love, yes.
I volunteer at the school.
#Really? What do you do there?

163
00:14:58,671 --> 00:15:02,268
I'm in the library.
I read to the little ones.
#What good!

164
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:09,041
So Alaska, eh?
#Yes.

165
00:15:11,104 --> 00:15:14,131
Are you staying?
#We will see.

166
00:15:14,156 --> 00:15:17,610
How is Liv?
#Busy.

167
00:15:18,881 --> 00:15:20,112
He returned to college.

168
00:15:21,223 --> 00:15:24,733
Also working and raising two kids.

169
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,977
Do you have everything?
#Say goodbye to grandma.

170
00:15:29,002 --> 00:15:32,229
- Goodbye!
- On my way!
#Just a moment ...

171
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:37,372
To you do not like
gifts, right?
- Yes!  - No, you ...

172
00:15:37,597 --> 00:15:39,623
Gifts? Really? Come on!

173
00:15:41,504 --> 00:15:43,651
- I'm going!
- I want to go!

174
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:48,554
Mason on the outward journey
and Samantha in the back.
#Top.

175
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:52,733
- Seat belts!
- Belts. Sure!
#Do not forget the belts.

176
00:15:53,432 --> 00:15:55,506
Neither has this car seat.

177
00:16:00,471 --> 00:16:03,188
All right. All right. All right!

178
00:16:04,465 --> 00:16:07,739
Very well!
#Come over! Yes!

179
00:16:08,464 --> 00:16:12,971
It was awesome!
#Now you, Mason, touches you!  It was very good!

180
00:16:12,996 --> 00:16:14,080
Come on!

181
00:16:14,935 --> 00:16:17,999
Show them who
are you, friend. I show him.

182
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,888
Yes! Yes!
#Yes!

183
00:16:27,031 --> 00:16:30,993
It's okay. Do not worry.
#I wish I'd packed.

184
00:16:31,018 --> 00:16:34,545
The stops are for children.
Do you have two years?

185
00:16:34,751 --> 00:16:38,038
They serve the stops.
Life does not give you caps.

186
00:16:42,421 --> 00:16:46,367
There he goes! Now!
#Anything goes!

187
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:55,302
The last time I had packed.
It was much more fun.
#They serve the stops.

188
00:16:55,327 --> 00:17:00,077
Yes all playing with low
stops, it means nothing.
#Believe me.

189
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:03,853
Lane only deposit it well.

190
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:06,775
<I> One ... two ... three, ... </ i>

191
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:12,490
Viva el father!

192
00:17:22,524 --> 00:17:26,818
<I> Four Blackwater employees were
savagely attacked in Fallujah. </ i>

193
00:17:26,843 --> 00:17:30,162
<I> The rebels set fire
the bodies and cars, and ... </ i>

194
00:17:30,187 --> 00:17:34,132
See? It is a disaster.
#I will tell you what is happening in Iraq.

195
00:17:34,157 --> 00:17:39,172
Exactly what every person
thinking I knew it would happen.

196
00:17:39,197 --> 00:17:44,164
A Bush and fans who
around them a damn.

197
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:46,784
25 cents!
#What?

198
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:49,714
You said "fuck".
#Forgiveness.

199
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:56,532
My teacher says it is a just war
because prevention is better than cure.

200
00:17:56,557 --> 00:17:59,851
Is that what they teach you?
Listen to your father.

201
00:17:59,876 --> 00:18:02,038
It's a lie. It is the big lie.

202
00:18:02,063 --> 00:18:06,055
Iraq had nothing to do with what the
twin towers. I know, right?

203
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:10,253
I suppose.
#By whom will vote, MJ?

204
00:18:10,417 --> 00:18:13,689
- I dunno.
- You can not vote. There is 18 years old.

205
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:15,964
Who did you vote for?

206
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,691
- Perry?
- Anyone but Bush! OK?

207
00:18:20,716 --> 00:18:22,539
Will you come back to live here?

208
00:18:23,451 --> 00:18:28,293
It's what I want.
I need to find work.
#Will you ever hang out with mom?

209
00:18:29,302 --> 00:18:32,862
I do not know. No ... just depends on me.

210
00:18:36,261 --> 00:18:40,309
I remember when I was six.
You and Mom fought like crazy.

211
00:18:40,334 --> 00:18:43,773
You scream so loud and mother cried.

212
00:18:44,232 --> 00:18:46,914
Is that what you remember?
#Yes.

213
00:18:46,939 --> 00:18:49,262
Do not you remember Galveston travel?

214
00:18:49,387 --> 00:18:53,196
And when we camped in
Big Bend and had fun?
#No.

215
00:18:54,379 --> 00:18:58,491
- Do you ever get mad at your mother?
- Yes.
- What about your brother?  - Yes!

216
00:18:58,716 --> 00:19:00,512
- Do they have you cried?
- Yes, of course.

217
00:19:00,537 --> 00:19:03,085
But that does not mean
not want, right?

218
00:19:04,513 --> 00:19:07,065
The same happens when you're an adult.

219
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,886
You get angry with people.
It's nothing important.

220
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,786
What did you do in Alaska?

221
00:19:14,393 --> 00:19:16,946
I worked on a boat ... for a while ...

222
00:19:17,744 --> 00:19:21,700
I tried to compose music.
#Did you see a polar bear?

223
00:19:21,725 --> 00:19:25,398
No, but I saw a Kodiak bear.
The fucking was huge!

224
00:19:25,422 --> 00:19:28,451
Dad! They are 50 cents
for using that word!

225
00:19:30,098 --> 00:19:31,217
Forgiveness.

226
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:35,048
Take a dollar. Keep the change.

227
00:19:36,026 --> 00:19:38,579
I will be seeing more often now.

228
00:19:38,604 --> 00:19:42,428
I missed a lot. I want them to know.

229
00:19:42,453 --> 00:19:44,436
I needed time for myself.

230
00:19:48,531 --> 00:19:51,119
Your mom and I ...

231
00:19:53,285 --> 00:19:58,125
His mother ... is ... difficult.
#I think they know.

232
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:02,857
And I'm ... I'm happy
be with you two.

233
00:20:03,196 --> 00:20:07,759
And sorry about the issue of the stops.
#I think I'm better than that. Is it okay?

234
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:14,139
This I found in Dripping Springs
Roddy and ... my friend gave me this.

235
00:20:14,164 --> 00:20:16,582
- And I bought it.
- Did you buy it?

236
00:20:16,607 --> 00:20:18,913
- Did you find her in Dripping Springs?
- Yep.

237
00:20:19,738 --> 00:20:24,450
Hottie! What else you got?
#These are vertebrae of snakes.

238
00:20:24,475 --> 00:20:26,311
Vertebrae of snakes? Yuck!

239
00:20:26,336 --> 00:20:29,727
Mason, I do not want you to gather
more vertebrae of snakes.

240
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:33,533
- This is the pen that I sent you?
- Yes.

241
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:37,734
Dad! I forgot to show you
these photos ... basketball.

242
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:41,375
- Are you on a basketball team?
- Yes.
#What good!

243
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,962
- Look at the claws of beavers.
- Claws of beavers?
#Quests beavers?

244
00:20:48,574 --> 00:20:51,466
What position do you play?
#Base.

245
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:56,032
This is dissected Canadian grass.
- You score?  - 8 to 10 per game.

246
00:20:56,057 --> 00:21:00,124
8 to 10? Incredible!
#Once he scored no points and wept.

247
00:21:00,149 --> 00:21:02,111
- Did you cry?
- A little.

248
00:21:04,865 --> 00:21:07,857
Hi!
#Mason! Came mom!

249
00:21:07,882 --> 00:21:09,564
- Came mom!
- Reached mom.

250
00:21:11,254 --> 00:21:15,943
Mom! Hi!
#See the owl I  He gave Dad. Is not it good?

251
00:21:15,968 --> 00:21:20,092
The head spins. Look at the bracelet.
Made by Indians in Alaska.

252
00:21:20,117 --> 00:21:24,439
Dad gave me this bear
carved by hand and this tiki.
#It is a totem.

253
00:21:24,464 --> 00:21:28,206
And guess! We played bowling
and had four perfect shots!

254
00:21:28,631 --> 00:21:33,294
And we could ride in Dad's car.
- Hey, Liv.  - Hi.

255
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:35,606
I know you wanted
let them hear about your mother.

256
00:21:35,631 --> 00:21:39,035
I thought it would be easier here.
#You ruined my plans.

257
00:21:41,184 --> 00:21:45,069
- We wanted to show the rooms.
- Yes.
#Did you eat anything?

258
00:21:45,094 --> 00:21:47,742
Ate fries
at the bowling alley.

259
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:50,638
- Did you do your homework?
- No. - Not yet.

260
00:21:50,663 --> 00:21:54,884
Can I talk to you outside for a second?
#Yes, of course.

261
00:21:57,808 --> 00:21:59,612
They ate more fries.

262
00:22:15,238 --> 00:22:17,632
Do you think he will stay for the night?

263
00:22:50,742 --> 00:22:54,232
An unconditioned stimulus,
something that produces ...

264
00:22:54,257 --> 00:22:59,696
unlearned response,
involuntary and not conditioned.

265
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:03,875
What was the stimulus used
by Pavlov in his experiment?

266
00:23:05,777 --> 00:23:09,069
Come on! Was it hard to
week? What? Meat!

267
00:23:09,094 --> 00:23:13,769
Meat. Or rather, meat powder.
#Whatever it was dust  meat, it worked with your dog.

268
00:23:13,794 --> 00:23:18,008
He placed the meat powder and produced
unconditioned response ...

269
00:23:18,033 --> 00:23:21,242
the dog was salivating ...!
#OK?

270
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:25,388
Who can give me another example of a
unconditioned response to the stimulus ...

271
00:23:25,413 --> 00:23:30,162
happens every day.
#Perhaps it is occurring  any of you now.

272
00:23:31,593 --> 00:23:32,715
What about sex?

273
00:23:33,144 --> 00:23:36,810
Come to an attractive member
the opposite sex and have a ...

274
00:23:36,835 --> 00:23:41,093
automatic response.
Not even have to think about it.
#Mick Jagger wrote a song:

275
00:23:41,118 --> 00:23:44,485
"Oh, when you named salivate
like a Pavlov dog. "

276
00:23:45,876 --> 00:23:47,897
Thank you very much. End of class.

277
00:24:01,221 --> 00:24:02,261
Dr. Welbrock.

278
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,879
This is my son, Mason.

279
00:24:06,142 --> 00:24:07,703
Mason, this is Dr. Welbrock.

280
00:24:07,728 --> 00:24:12,629
Your son! I thought it was a genius
Children who attended my class.

281
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:16,805
He was not feeling well, so I brought.

282
00:24:17,734 --> 00:24:22,422
No fever. It is a hoax.
#I know because my son  nine years he always does.

283
00:24:22,447 --> 00:24:25,913
The same matter.
- Do you play football?  - No.

284
00:24:25,948 --> 00:24:28,633
My son either. He hates football.
He likes computers.

285
00:24:28,658 --> 00:24:31,581
My daughter loves it 11
football. Who understands it?

286
00:24:31,606 --> 00:24:35,122
Maybe we could join us sometime.
#Maybe, yes.

287
00:24:35,927 --> 00:24:40,491
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
- Nice, Mason.  - Nice.

288
00:24:40,526 --> 00:24:42,139
And thanks for coming to my class.

289
00:24:43,651 --> 00:24:44,738
Olivia.

290
00:24:45,768 --> 00:24:47,760
- Cute kid.
- Thank you!

291
00:24:48,614 --> 00:24:52,976
Do you think Grandma will
available to care for the kids?

292
00:24:54,012 --> 00:24:58,332
Perhaps.
- Really?  - Yes.

293
00:25:02,758 --> 00:25:04,154
To awaken the dead!

294
00:25:04,722 --> 00:25:07,763
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, you're alive!

295
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:26,339
Touch Me!
#Guys! They arrived!

296
00:25:27,899 --> 00:25:29,643
Quick, quick!

297
00:25:31,068 --> 00:25:32,728
WELCOME NEWLYWEDS

298
00:25:39,868 --> 00:25:44,107
We're back!
- I missed you!  - Hey, Dad!

299
00:25:44,932 --> 00:25:47,371
Samantha, Mason, thank you!

300
00:25:54,546 --> 00:25:58,881
Samantha and I did it alone.
#I know that men do not go that high.

301
00:26:01,306 --> 00:26:03,602
A distribute gifts!

302
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:12,450
We take a huge lift. Top
all throw a paper airplane.

303
00:26:12,475 --> 00:26:14,862
What happened?
#It flew!

304
00:26:14,887 --> 00:26:17,615
He flew several kilometers.

305
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,247
Will they kissed under
Bridge of Sighs?

306
00:26:21,272 --> 00:26:23,672
- Yes.
- We did.

307
00:26:25,786 --> 00:26:28,649
- Mom, can we see your ring?
- Clear.

308
00:26:31,361 --> 00:26:36,485
It is a stepped ring,
surrounded by bright miniature.

309
00:26:36,741 --> 00:26:40,948
- I wish we could go to Europe.
- Yes.
#We go as a family next time.

310
00:26:40,973 --> 00:26:44,880
Not much is lost.
We were at the hotel ...
#playing video games.

311
00:26:45,305 --> 00:26:49,432
Really?
#And the hotels are  very young and very old.

312
00:26:49,757 --> 00:26:53,312
Did I get you anything else?
You want the dessert menu?

313
00:26:53,337 --> 00:26:57,461
I said lay it up.
Keep it in your wallet, please.
#Little games on the table.

314
00:26:57,486 --> 00:26:59,566
Another bottle of wine, please.

315
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:01,746
A coke.

316
00:27:01,771 --> 00:27:06,240
Mason, you're okay with water.
Just coca. Thank you.

317
00:27:06,265 --> 00:27:10,042
And what about you?
Did you finish your science project?
#Not yet.

318
00:27:11,161 --> 00:27:14,265
Did you work? You built
something or something you planned?

319
00:27:14,748 --> 00:27:18,298
- A little.
- Did you do anything, Mindy?
#No.

320
00:27:18,323 --> 00:27:22,314
Have you sat with Mason
and little games all the time?
#Yes.

321
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:28,829
You had to finish
that before my return.
#Do you remember?

322
00:27:32,405 --> 00:27:36,605
- Grevious is the best.
- Yoda! Yoda!

323
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,623
- Has four arms!
- Yoda!

324
00:27:39,907 --> 00:27:43,397
Miss Odio. Burnsley.
Everyone thinks it's a lesbian.

325
00:27:46,492 --> 00:27:50,802
- Yuck!
- Is it true?
#Always walk around the locker room.

326
00:27:51,578 --> 00:27:53,272
I think I saw a couple of ...

327
00:27:56,708 --> 00:28:01,509
Paul! Tell us a joke.
#Fuck! Fuck!  Fuck you! Ass!

328
00:28:18,415 --> 00:28:21,030
- I gave you!
- That was not fair.

329
00:28:22,091 --> 00:28:24,972
Yes it was. It was more just world.

330
00:28:28,563 --> 00:28:30,611
Yes! Again I got.

331
00:28:33,185 --> 00:28:36,067
Does the mask?
#Do the three musketeers?

332
00:28:36,361 --> 00:28:39,699
First word.
- Chicken?  - Chicken.

333
00:28:42,423 --> 00:28:43,505
Second word.

334
00:28:44,786 --> 00:28:47,250
- Hoodie.
- Big Hair ... Robin Hood!

335
00:28:52,024 --> 00:28:53,056
Second word.

336
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:58,726
Manta?
#Props, no!

337
00:29:00,018 --> 00:29:04,563
Talk a judge. No on props.
You can not use props.

338
00:29:04,588 --> 00:29:06,860
You can do without that. Think!

339
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,788
Moving ... Witnesses?

340
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,965
Folding ...
#Something with a blanket.

341
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:18,358
- Crack ...
- A crack in time!

342
00:29:19,702 --> 00:29:22,332
Harry Potter
and the Deathly Sale

343
00:29:44,356 --> 00:29:46,255
Are you ready?

344
00:29:50,202 --> 00:29:56,003
Count together, ladies
and gentlemen:10 ... 9 ... 8 ... 7 ...

345
00:29:56,238 --> 00:30:02,184
6 ... 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ...

346
00:30:02,963 --> 00:30:04,858
Come on!

347
00:30:30,102 --> 00:30:33,451
No, no, no. Back
and practice the first blow.

348
00:30:33,476 --> 00:30:37,479
Gently.
Sweep the floor, sweep the floor.
#As well.

349
00:30:38,726 --> 00:30:41,676
Do not hit hard.
Always hits it too hard.

350
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:49,780
Your feet farther back.
#As well. Now you can hit straighter.

351
00:30:50,923 --> 00:30:54,726
Hit. A soft knock
and slow will be the best for you.

352
00:30:56,158 --> 00:30:57,743
Very well!

353
00:30:59,633 --> 00:31:04,465
You have ... Your feet
are too open, Randy!
#Naturally.

354
00:31:05,492 --> 00:31:08,236
Yes! Very well!

355
00:31:08,669 --> 00:31:11,452
High five.
Good putt, son, good putt.

356
00:31:11,811 --> 00:31:14,036
Did you see that, Randy? This is done.

357
00:31:15,762 --> 00:31:16,863
Putt for birdie!

358
00:31:22,865 --> 00:31:25,697
Fuck!
#Son of a bitch!

359
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:29,314
Will you bring me sticks? Go get the ball.

360
00:31:37,456 --> 00:31:39,784
For if we have visitors this weekend.

361
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:45,175
He always says that,
but never have visitors.

362
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:20,075
Samantha, I think you got your dad.
#All right.

363
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,784
Did they finish the housework?
#Not all.

364
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:24,201
Almost.

365
00:32:25,888 --> 00:32:28,732
You took the powder, Sam?
#Not yet.

366
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:31,135
I saw you with your art project.

367
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,751
Did you have time to finish
but not for your chores?

368
00:32:34,776 --> 00:32:37,934
I thought we had talked.
#I can remove dust.

369
00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:41,348
No. You have your own
tasks and Sam has his.

370
00:32:41,725 --> 00:32:43,188
It's simple!

371
00:32:44,515 --> 00:32:46,187
Bad decision, Sam.

372
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:00,210
Mason!
#He arrived your dad.

373
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:08,092
No blinding for speed, right?
#How did? Does half? Eh!

374
00:33:09,788 --> 00:33:14,396
- They finished?
- No.
#Task completed?

375
00:33:14,921 --> 00:33:19,906
What will you do tomorrow?
- The same, right?  - Yes.

376
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:21,298
Come in.

377
00:33:25,245 --> 00:33:27,964
Goodbye, Mom.
#Goodbye dear. I love you.

378
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:31,085
- Goodbye, Mom.
- Goodbye, little girl.

379
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:34,024
- Have fun with your father.
- Wait, Mason.

380
00:33:35,912 --> 00:33:40,088
The boys did not end with the leaves.
Samantha did not end with the dust ...

381
00:33:40,572 --> 00:33:42,037
So tomorrow, when they return,

382
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:44,630
instead of swimming or other
things they like to do,

383
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:46,747
- They will finish their homework, okay?
- Yes.

384
00:33:46,772 --> 00:33:49,615
Well, I have spoken. Do you understand?

385
00:33:56,828 --> 00:33:58,884
I support. Get it?

386
00:33:58,909 --> 00:34:01,839
Does everyone agree? Tomorrow, tasks ...

387
00:34:01,864 --> 00:34:04,366
I do not hear. Les enters
by one ear and out the other.

388
00:34:04,391 --> 00:34:06,775
Dad does not make sense to remove dust.

389
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:11,413
Yes it does.
It's just that you do not like it.
#Who spends the duster today?

390
00:34:11,438 --> 00:34:13,382
You when we tell you!

391
00:34:13,407 --> 00:34:17,638
Olivia, do not let me answer
and in front of the other. Thank you.

392
00:34:17,663 --> 00:34:19,294
Samantha, please ...

393
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:24,227
What ever.
#Bye Bye. The pass very well.

394
00:34:24,452 --> 00:34:26,459
Bye, guys. I love you.

395
00:34:29,293 --> 00:34:33,589
Sorry but what we talked about. There are
to draw a line and get tough.

396
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:35,814
Yes, it is ...
have many lines, Bill.

397
00:34:36,948 --> 00:34:40,007
Everything is online.
#Hi, Randy! Hi, guys.

398
00:34:40,232 --> 00:34:44,060
And how are you two?
#I'm going forward.

399
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:48,009
- I post this. Are you okay, honey?
- Yes.

400
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,359
- And you, champ?
- I'm fine.

401
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:55,739
What good!
#On my way!

402
00:35:05,718 --> 00:35:07,502
Are you ready for the big game?

403
00:35:08,503 --> 00:35:12,511
- Yes.
- Against whom the Astros playing today?
#I do not know.

404
00:35:12,536 --> 00:35:15,082
Brewers Milwaukee.
Know them, hate them.

405
00:35:15,107 --> 00:35:18,467
Mason, what about you?
How was your week?
#Pretty good.

406
00:35:18,492 --> 00:35:23,394
What did you do?
- Nothing.  - You keep hanging out with Joe?

407
00:35:23,419 --> 00:35:26,459
- Yep.
- Is your best friend yet?
#I think so.

408
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:31,924
- And you? How was your week?
- All right.
#What did you do?

409
00:35:32,689 --> 00:35:36,723
Nothing important.
#Still ... working with sculpture?

410
00:35:36,748 --> 00:35:39,613
Yes. Almost finished.
#What is it?

411
00:35:40,218 --> 00:35:41,272
You're welcome.

412
00:35:44,135 --> 00:35:48,991
No, no, no, no.
So we will not talk with us.

413
00:35:49,816 --> 00:35:54,080
I will not be that guy.
#They can not put me in that category.

414
00:35:57,154 --> 00:35:58,944
"I chat with who kindly ...

415
00:35:58,969 --> 00:36:01,633
"As he takes me aside
to another and buys me things. "No!

416
00:36:02,058 --> 00:36:04,921
Talk to me!
"Samantha, how was your week?"

417
00:36:04,946 --> 00:36:07,764
"It was hard. Separated Billy and Ellen ...

418
00:36:07,789 --> 00:36:10,227
"Ellen is angry because
he saw me talking to Billy ...

419
00:36:10,252 --> 00:36:13,095
"In the dining room. Remember the
sculpture he was doing?

420
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,351
"It was a unicorn horn
broke. Now it's a zebra. "

421
00:36:16,376 --> 00:36:18,343
"But I think it'll take me like 10"

422
00:36:19,202 --> 00:36:23,994
"Mason, how was your week?
"You know, it was pretty hard.
#"Joey is dumb medium.

423
00:36:24,019 --> 00:36:26,968
"He stole cigarettes
mother and wanted me to smoke.

424
00:36:26,993 --> 00:36:30,416
"I said no because I knew what
that will cost you leave, Dad. "

425
00:36:30,441 --> 00:36:34,310
What's up? Is it so difficult?
#These questions are  difficult to answer.

426
00:36:34,335 --> 00:36:38,662
What is so difficult
describe a sculpture?
#It's Abstract!

427
00:36:39,348 --> 00:36:40,663
OK. OK, fine.

428
00:36:40,688 --> 00:36:44,886
Ni did not even know ...
you were interested in abstract art.

429
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:49,465
But, dad, why
always us? What about you?

430
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:53,439
How was your week?
Who do you walk? You have a girlfriend?

431
00:36:53,464 --> 00:36:56,714
What have you done?
#You're right.

432
00:36:58,975 --> 00:37:03,287
So we have to leave
everything comes naturally, right?
#That's what you say.

433
00:37:03,312 --> 00:37:06,739
OK! It's what we do.
#From now.

434
00:37:20,162 --> 00:37:21,427
Look at this!

435
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:29,500
It is a ...
#It is an owl butterfly.

436
00:37:29,525 --> 00:37:32,550
<I> Caligo Atreus. </ I>
Look at this!

437
00:37:32,575 --> 00:37:37,037
What kind is it?
#Looks like a zebra long-winged.

438
00:37:37,062 --> 00:37:40,825
- Very well!
- Good.
#This is amazing.

439
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:44,977
- That is the Owl, right?
- Yes
Owl butterfly.

440
00:37:45,478 --> 00:37:47,095
I peed, friend.

441
00:37:49,837 --> 00:37:53,621
1 ... 2 ... 3 ... 4 ...

442
00:37:54,046 --> 00:37:55,314
five.

443
00:38:16,835 --> 00:38:17,956
Get away from me!

444
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:26,602
Mason! Look at me.
#Form a diamond with your hands.

445
00:38:26,627 --> 00:38:31,241
Fingers and thumbs. Soft hands.
#Sam.

446
00:38:31,566 --> 00:38:34,379
Very well.
#This is done.

447
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:39,040
Still running, you still
thinking of the diamond.
#Diamond, and soft hands.

448
00:38:39,568 --> 00:38:40,455
Right.

449
00:38:56,692 --> 00:38:57,916
Come on, Roger!

450
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:11,428
They can not stick when he throws balls.
#So they know what they are watching.

451
00:39:11,453 --> 00:39:13,708
It is history. You see this guy?

452
00:39:13,733 --> 00:39:17,656
Its 43 years
and leaves rates hit 20.

453
00:39:17,881 --> 00:39:22,155
He has a batting average of 1.47.
#What can you believe?

454
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:25,331
If the Astros could make some
bases, we would win a game.

455
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:28,362
Dad, do you have a job?

456
00:39:31,908 --> 00:39:35,057
Why do you ask that?
#Mom wanted to know ...

457
00:39:35,482 --> 00:39:38,780
Mom wanted to know.
#Tell Mom ...

458
00:39:38,805 --> 00:39:43,395
they just happen ... I just
my second actuarial exam.

459
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:50,620
How is she?
- Finishing college?  - Yes All 10..

460
00:39:50,645 --> 00:39:53,568
Do all 10 eh?
#The mother went to the daughter, right?

461
00:40:49,618 --> 00:40:51,321
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Hi, Samantha.

462
00:40:51,346 --> 00:40:54,837
- What about Jimmy?
- What about Mason?

463
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:58,263
Astros won.
#Were the party?

464
00:40:58,288 --> 00:41:02,741
Am I the only one with arms?
No one else can bring anything?
#And help your man?

465
00:41:02,766 --> 00:41:07,515
What are you looking at?
#Jimmy, you know who came  guys this weekend.

466
00:41:07,787 --> 00:41:10,078
For once,
Could not you help me a little?

467
00:41:10,103 --> 00:41:12,340
- Sorry, Muffin.
- Do not give me Muffin.

468
00:41:12,365 --> 00:41:15,534
I'm not the fucking dog Tony Randall.

469
00:41:16,264 --> 00:41:19,513
- Dad is always messy.
- It was not the morning.

470
00:41:21,002 --> 00:41:23,532
- I cut the grass.
- Good.

471
00:41:24,974 --> 00:41:27,796
Come on, get that shit.
#Give me that.

472
00:41:31,293 --> 00:41:35,035
- Did you see the match?
- No.
#Lane won a  career three-pointers.

473
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:39,170
It was beautiful, right?
#Sam went crazy.

474
00:41:39,195 --> 00:41:42,202
He is a fan of the Astros.
#You sure.

475
00:41:42,227 --> 00:41:47,090
<I> Lunar eclipse on Saturday night </ i>

476
00:41:47,115 --> 00:41:50,420
<I> sang a song, something like:</ i>

477
00:41:51,823 --> 00:41:56,352
<I> my tired children sleep </ i>

478
00:41:57,646 --> 00:42:02,271
<I> sirens pass </ i>

479
00:42:03,472 --> 00:42:07,898
<I> Tonight we
safe here in Houston </ i>

480
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:13,096
<I> with this lullaby Dad </ i>

481
00:42:14,816 --> 00:42:18,120
<I> Her mother has a new husband now </ i>

482
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,968
<I> seems all well </ i>

483
00:42:22,202 --> 00:42:25,098
<I> I wonder if they storytelling </ i>

484
00:42:26,234 --> 00:42:28,641
<I> and if you give them a kiss good night </ i>

485
00:42:30,232 --> 00:42:32,699
<I> They say they miss me </ i>

486
00:42:33,834 --> 00:42:36,323
<I> should not wish that were true </ i>

487
00:42:37,676 --> 00:42:41,181
<I> The teacher says my child
draws pictures of a family </ i>

488
00:42:41,705 --> 00:42:43,740
<I> all blue. </ I>

489
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:48,012
<I> He says he was surprised
whispering to the window:</ i>

490
00:42:49,103 --> 00:42:51,800
<I> "Daddy, please come home" </ i>

491
00:42:53,479 --> 00:42:56,025
<I> I know I could call </ i>

492
00:42:56,695 --> 00:42:59,888
<I> but what if the mother takes the call </ i>

493
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:07,203
- Did you brush your teeth?
- What?
#Did you brush your teeth?

494
00:43:07,628 --> 00:43:11,771
Yes.
#Are not you stay asleep  with these bullrings posts?

495
00:43:11,796 --> 00:43:13,881
Perhaps.
#Try not.

496
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:16,329
- I turn off the light?
- Yes.

497
00:43:17,054 --> 00:43:19,474
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night, Dad.

498
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,744
- Good night, Sam.
- Goodnight, Jimmy.

499
00:43:26,106 --> 00:43:29,432
- Today was fun, right?
- Yes, it was. I'm sorry.

500
00:43:30,591 --> 00:43:33,225
- What?
- That has to be Mason.

501
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:36,537
- Good night.
- Good night.

502
00:43:41,853 --> 00:43:42,921
Dad?

503
00:43:44,984 --> 00:43:49,441
In reality there is ...
#magic in the world, right?

504
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:52,999
What do you mean?

505
00:43:53,034 --> 00:43:57,854
You know, like ... elves and stuff.
#People invents.

506
00:43:59,543 --> 00:44:00,616
I dunno.

507
00:44:01,743 --> 00:44:05,920
What makes you think that
magical elves are something like ...

508
00:44:06,222 --> 00:44:09,400
like a whale.
#Do you understand me?

509
00:44:09,425 --> 00:44:13,963
What if I tell you how ...
#under the ocean there is this ...

510
00:44:14,682 --> 00:44:20,103
giant mammal using
sonar and sing songs?

511
00:44:20,128 --> 00:44:24,580
And what's so great that his heart
is the size of a car, and could ...

512
00:44:24,605 --> 00:44:29,331
crawl through your arteries?
#You seem quite magical, right?

513
00:44:29,456 --> 00:44:30,387
Yes.

514
00:44:32,459 --> 00:44:35,483
But ... say ...
at this very moment,

515
00:44:35,508 --> 00:44:39,524
no elves in the world, right?

516
00:44:42,654 --> 00:44:44,810
No. In short, no elves.

517
00:44:57,222 --> 00:44:59,359
Be well, guys.

518
00:45:00,684 --> 00:45:05,417
Have a great week.
- Sam, see you this weekend.  - Yes. Right, I forgot.

519
00:45:05,442 --> 00:45:08,707
Cindy's birthday on Saturday.
- You're sleeping?  - Yes.

520
00:45:08,732 --> 00:45:12,598
I'll talk to your mom.
#Do not worry. Have a good time.

521
00:45:18,854 --> 00:45:21,872
How do you not know how to do this?

522
00:45:23,293 --> 00:45:25,585
I will soon markers.

523
00:45:34,954 --> 00:45:39,388
Randy Mason, Dad wants down.
- For what?  - Haircuts.

524
00:46:02,414 --> 00:46:06,996
It will look much better.
#You look like a man and not a little girl.

525
00:46:11,343 --> 00:46:13,614
And eyebrows too, right Byron?

526
00:46:28,502 --> 00:46:29,840
Mason, we're leaving.

527
00:46:31,804 --> 00:46:33,532
You're not sick!

528
00:46:42,766 --> 00:46:45,918
- Bye, guys.
- Goodbye, Mom.
#And Mason?

529
00:46:46,071 --> 00:46:50,978
It does not feel good.
I will not go to school.
#The patient does.

530
00:46:51,618 --> 00:46:52,925
Ya.

531
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:58,646
Mason, what happens?

532
00:47:03,163 --> 00:47:07,092
I do not feel well.
#Your head is fine,  so out of bed.

533
00:47:07,117 --> 00:47:10,537
I'm taking.
You have five minutes. Do not be late.

534
00:47:27,974 --> 00:47:31,600
Neither asked me!
#He cut and ready.

535
00:47:31,925 --> 00:47:36,160
Is my hair!
#No wonder you're angry.  I would be too.

536
00:47:37,288 --> 00:47:39,088
I am a Martian now.

537
00:47:42,569 --> 00:47:45,729
Honey, I'll talk to him
later, okay?

538
00:47:45,754 --> 00:47:50,602
You should have called
but he had the phone.
#I'm sorry.

539
00:47:50,627 --> 00:47:52,986
I've been so
busy with college ...

540
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:58,772
If it helps, it's just hair
and will grow again.

541
00:48:00,563 --> 00:48:03,667
Now I can see your
nice eyes and your face fox.

542
00:48:03,692 --> 00:48:06,595
And why did you marry
with him? It is a total moron.

543
00:48:09,427 --> 00:48:13,459
Bill has its good things.
Nobody is perfect.

544
00:48:14,471 --> 00:48:15,799
And now we have a family.

545
00:48:17,024 --> 00:48:18,600
We already had a family.

546
00:48:28,638 --> 00:48:34,209
"I pledge allegiance to the flag of
United States of America,

547
00:48:34,234 --> 00:48:38,106
"And to the republic
by which it is held,

548
00:48:38,131 --> 00:48:42,420
"One nation under God, indivisible,

549
00:48:42,445 --> 00:48:47,396
"With liberty and justice for all."
Recite the oath of Texas.

550
00:48:47,421 --> 00:48:50,182
"Honor the Texas flag;

551
00:48:50,207 --> 00:48:53,603
"I pledge allegiance, Texas,

552
00:48:53,628 --> 00:48:57,453
"One state under God,
one and indivisible. "
Thank you. Have a seat.

553
00:48:58,979 --> 00:49:00,291
Ya!

554
00:49:03,313 --> 00:49:06,857
As you know, we are
working with mythology,

555
00:49:06,882 --> 00:49:09,787
and will write about gods and goddesses.

556
00:49:09,812 --> 00:49:12,410
We have listed
Gods on the board.

557
00:49:12,435 --> 00:49:16,009
There are a couple
monsters for those interested.

558
00:49:16,034 --> 00:49:20,819
They will write an essay
about gods and goddesses.
#To address all issues,

559
00:49:20,844 --> 00:49:23,279
make sure you do all these things.

560
00:49:23,304 --> 00:49:26,623
First, we must
name the god or goddess.

561
00:49:26,648 --> 00:49:30,577
And you have to add the "who", "what" ...
#MASON, YOUR HAIR I LOVE IT!

562
00:49:30,602 --> 00:49:32,602
"When", "where", "why" and "how".

563
00:49:33,296 --> 00:49:36,932
Verify that it is
all to write the essay.

564
00:49:42,017 --> 00:49:43,522
Donkey.

565
00:49:55,683 --> 00:49:57,490
- See you.
- Yes.

566
00:50:10,044 --> 00:50:11,991
- Mom, are you okay?
- What happened?

567
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:16,840
No, no. Go to the house.
A house. Go to the house!

568
00:50:16,865 --> 00:50:21,148
Your mother had an accident.
#And now it's melodramatic

569
00:50:22,913 --> 00:50:25,873
Get off the fucking
floor, Olivia. God.

570
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:17,995
I'll take a drink with my dinner.

571
00:51:20,021 --> 00:51:22,145
Anyone else have a problem with that?

572
00:51:24,652 --> 00:51:26,126
- Samantha?
- No.

573
00:51:29,902 --> 00:51:32,198
- Mindy?
- No.

574
00:51:35,644 --> 00:51:36,972
I thought not.

575
00:51:48,555 --> 00:51:50,699
I do not like me very much, do you, Mason?

576
00:51:53,884 --> 00:51:55,807
I did not like me very much.

577
00:51:58,083 --> 00:51:59,370
Do you think that's funny?

578
00:52:02,072 --> 00:52:03,641
You think that's funny?

579
00:52:09,622 --> 00:52:11,894
What's wrong? Do you feel left out?

580
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:15,106
Clean it, shit! Clean it up!

581
00:52:15,631 --> 00:52:19,329
Clean it motherfuckers! I hate pumpkin!

582
00:52:28,731 --> 00:52:32,753
<I> Girl, I'll pay. I have three
jobs right now ... </ i>

583
00:52:32,806 --> 00:52:36,549
How many times you'll see it, Mason?
#It is funny.

584
00:52:36,574 --> 00:52:40,413
<I> I'm with my friend now.
Reviewing my C.V. </ I>

585
00:52:40,738 --> 00:52:43,759
<I> I'll stick </ i>

586
00:52:43,784 --> 00:52:47,927
<I> You know what? You need to calm down. </ I>
<I> I want my money! </ I>

587
00:52:47,952 --> 00:52:50,095
<I> Why do you need fast </ i>

588
00:52:51,490 --> 00:52:55,643
Had already been so wrong?
#No, but I cried a lot.

589
00:52:55,668 --> 00:52:58,475
But throwing and breaking things.

590
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:02,716
<I> Yes. You are drunk. I knew it.
You're drunk. </ I>

591
00:53:05,145 --> 00:53:06,505
Their cell.

592
00:53:15,429 --> 00:53:17,281
So nobody talked to her.

593
00:53:26,691 --> 00:53:29,465
- Mason?
- No.

594
00:53:33,629 --> 00:53:35,174
- Mindy?
- No.

595
00:53:36,207 --> 00:53:37,369
I believe you.

596
00:53:43,399 --> 00:53:45,503
- Samantha?
- No.

597
00:53:53,203 --> 00:53:55,471
I did not talk to her. He left a message.

598
00:53:57,910 --> 00:54:01,079
What did it say?
#Not much.

599
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:04,895
What did it say?

600
00:54:06,052 --> 00:54:07,757
Would return later.

601
00:54:09,288 --> 00:54:11,399
Is that all?
"Do I'll be back later," click?

602
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:15,518
He said, "Stay in
Quarter back later. "

603
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:20,226
Answer it be
in their rooms. Nothing more.
#Yes.

604
00:54:20,651 --> 00:54:23,400
Where is?
- I do not know.  - Where is he?

605
00:54:23,525 --> 00:54:24,747
Said No!

606
00:54:30,051 --> 00:54:32,048
All the car.

607
00:54:33,194 --> 00:54:34,662
Fast! The car!

608
00:54:36,004 --> 00:54:40,116
REMOVE YOUR RECEIPT
INSUFFICIENT FUNDS

609
00:54:44,207 --> 00:54:46,993
- Still not working.
- Shit.

610
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:51,647
It took everything.

611
00:54:53,905 --> 00:54:56,404
Randy, go to collect it.

612
00:54:57,710 --> 00:55:00,594
Tell him I'm not feeling well or something.

613
00:55:03,041 --> 00:55:04,400
Mason, accompany it!

614
00:55:05,639 --> 00:55:07,256
Take my identification.

615
00:55:19,448 --> 00:55:24,283
Good evening, folks.
How I can help?
#What's this?

616
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:31,046
This is not you!
#Who is?

617
00:55:31,843 --> 00:55:35,953
It is our ... father.
#It does not feel good.

618
00:55:36,478 --> 00:55:41,073
Yes! I know.
#Let's see.

619
00:55:43,422 --> 00:55:44,589
Five hundred dollars.

620
00:55:48,665 --> 00:55:53,606
Five hundred dollars.
#Do not forget to identification.

621
00:55:55,254 --> 00:55:57,840
Take care of your father, son. You only have one.

622
00:56:05,417 --> 00:56:06,373
Fuck!

623
00:56:07,398 --> 00:56:10,435
Out of the way! God!

624
00:56:23,571 --> 00:56:25,924
Samantha!
#Mason!

625
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:30,222
Samantha!

626
00:56:32,924 --> 00:56:36,685
Where the fuck have you been?
#I leave you, Bill. We're out of here.

627
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:39,978
I doubt it.
#Samantha, Mason! Lower!

628
00:56:40,203 --> 00:56:44,077
I do not think.
- And this one?  - I'm not here for you!

629
00:56:44,402 --> 00:56:49,351
I know. You are here to protect
my wife. Thank you.
#Back!

630
00:56:51,001 --> 00:56:55,944
Sign. What the devil are you doing?
#Get back up. They will not go anywhere.

631
00:56:55,969 --> 00:57:00,408
Enough! Come on!
#Where do they think they are?

632
00:57:00,433 --> 00:57:02,737
- No one's going anywhere, dammit.
- Enough!

633
00:57:02,762 --> 00:57:07,457
- No, fucking ...
- Do not touch my children!
- Okay. Take them.  - Do not touch!

634
00:57:07,782 --> 00:57:12,475
- Get in the car!
- Take them! Take them!
#Adelante!

635
00:57:13,922 --> 00:57:16,742
Get in!
#Olivia!

636
00:57:17,367 --> 00:57:18,860
Place yourselves belts.

637
00:57:30,785 --> 00:57:34,615
Where are we going?
#We'll stay in Carol a while.

638
00:57:37,951 --> 00:57:41,408
Do not look back!
#Everything will be fine.

639
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:02,541
Lee and Mason. Take
a break. Here's sandwiches.

640
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:22,705
Hey, Abby.
#Can I get help?

641
00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:26,081
Why not come Randy and Mindy?

642
00:58:27,434 --> 00:58:31,530
I'm not his legal guardian, my love.
It would be a kidnapping. I can not ...

643
00:58:31,897 --> 00:58:36,739
What will happen?
#What happens when the tutor  is dangerous and abusive legal?

644
00:58:36,764 --> 00:58:41,629
I do not know, honey.
#I called his mom. I called  the protection agencies.

645
00:58:41,913 --> 00:58:43,595
Here I have you and your brother.

646
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:46,827
We are in a situation
dangerous. It is my responsibility.

647
00:58:47,504 --> 00:58:51,648
Will be back to see?
#I do not know.

648
00:58:52,825 --> 00:58:56,194
I hope so.
#How long we will be here?

649
00:58:58,380 --> 00:58:59,842
Not much. We are ...

650
00:59:05,242 --> 00:59:07,450
I have no answers for everything!

651
00:59:08,647 --> 00:59:12,575
Hey. We are happy to
long as they want them.

652
00:59:13,278 --> 00:59:16,916
The time needed.
#It's fun, right?

653
00:59:17,647 --> 00:59:20,694
Like having an older sister.
Like having a brother.

654
00:59:21,166 --> 00:59:24,524
We will help at all.
Neither will notice our presence.

655
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,421
Mom, is horrible!

656
00:59:39,446 --> 00:59:44,148
You leave me in the parking lot
school. Do not know anyone.

657
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:49,112
I left all my friends
and I could not even say goodbye.
#Do not know where to go!

658
00:59:49,137 --> 00:59:52,661
Samantha, simply
to pass that door.
#The office is there.

659
00:59:52,686 --> 00:59:56,242
Await you. They will give you your schedule.
Here you go for lunch.

660
00:59:56,267 --> 00:59:58,451
I'll find you here at 3 and 30.

661
00:59:58,691 --> 01:00:03,531
I'm with dirty clothes, because ...
#Not let us go  find our stuff!

662
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:06,516
Neither have a place to live!

663
01:00:07,948 --> 01:00:10,922
It stinks!
#Samantha!

664
01:00:11,547 --> 01:00:15,394
I do the best I can!
#And you're right, it sucks!

665
01:00:15,419 --> 01:00:18,702
But not stink half as
what an idiot drunk sucks ...

666
01:00:18,727 --> 01:00:21,190
banging your head against the wall!

667
01:00:21,215 --> 01:00:24,500
So enough with the attitude
shit! Strap yourself.

668
01:00:32,147 --> 01:00:35,091
If you need anything I'll be in the classroom 112.

669
01:00:36,495 --> 01:00:38,020
This is the classroom of Mrs.. Darby.

670
01:00:39,514 --> 01:00:42,523
Everything will be fine, honey.
#Mom!

671
01:00:43,969 --> 01:00:46,627
YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR
YOUR OWN ACTIONS!

672
01:00:55,504 --> 01:00:59,840
Are you Mason?
#I am Mrs. Darby.  Nice to meet you.

673
01:01:00,265 --> 01:01:01,595
Sit here.

674
01:01:03,172 --> 01:01:05,413
- Kenny.
- Yes, ma'am.

675
01:01:05,638 --> 01:01:09,710
Kenny, this is Mason
and I want you to show the place today.

676
01:01:12,228 --> 01:01:17,191
Hello. Welcome to the mess.
#The class! Listen!

677
01:01:17,416 --> 01:01:22,260
We have a new student with us.
#His name is Mason.  It is sitting in the back row.

678
01:01:22,914 --> 01:01:24,896
Kenny will be your buddy, but ...

679
01:01:24,921 --> 01:01:28,470
want everyone to take
time to show up today

680
01:01:28,495 --> 01:01:30,208
and welcome to the school.

681
01:01:30,633 --> 01:01:33,935
Is it okay? Begin.

682
01:02:03,044 --> 01:02:03,974
What do you want?

683
01:02:05,924 --> 01:02:08,389
Can we put a
Obama poster in your garden?

684
01:02:08,414 --> 01:02:11,460
Do I look to support
Barack Hussein Obama?

685
01:02:12,598 --> 01:02:13,678
No.

686
01:02:15,461 --> 01:02:19,100
It is private property, leave.
#You could shoot!

687
01:02:24,173 --> 01:02:27,717
- What an idiot.
- Had a southern flag at home.

688
01:02:28,542 --> 01:02:32,500
I love it. Young people
work supporting Obama. What good!

689
01:02:32,781 --> 01:02:36,412
Did you make it through school?
#Our dad is a big fan.

690
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:40,925
What good. We have to
together to win.

691
01:02:41,350 --> 01:02:44,933
Yes.
#I want both!

692
01:02:44,958 --> 01:02:48,432
I had a dream in which she kissed.
He is so handsome, right?

693
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:54,175
I made some shirts for
my children, "My Mama supports Obama."

694
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:58,852
- Do you like it? - Yes.
- It's good, right?
#Thanks for the poster!

695
01:03:00,349 --> 01:03:01,829
Very well! Looking good!

696
01:03:04,086 --> 01:03:07,833
How many were you? Two?
Let's go. Come on, Sam.

697
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:11,103
- Go for the poster McCain.
- What?
#McCain poster.

698
01:03:11,128 --> 01:03:14,816
Crank it! Come on.
#Bring it! Yes, yes, yes!

699
01:03:18,629 --> 01:03:21,691
Good job.
#I'm proud of you.

700
01:03:25,729 --> 01:03:27,644
They are going to arrest you for you.

701
01:03:27,669 --> 01:03:31,270
I am a patriot.
Sometimes you have to fight in life.

702
01:03:33,296 --> 01:03:36,497
And what do you do at these parties?

703
01:03:37,953 --> 01:03:41,904
I do not know ... I talk, dance, listen to music.

704
01:03:42,329 --> 01:03:46,800
And what's more fun than going
I camp with your brother and your father?

705
01:03:47,082 --> 01:03:49,775
Yes.
#Sorry!

706
01:03:49,886 --> 01:03:51,552
Will there be alcohol?

707
01:03:52,355 --> 01:03:55,560
I think not. Perhaps some
of the bigger guys.

708
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:57,950
I know what the party is about.

709
01:03:57,975 --> 01:04:02,166
The parents are out
someone got a keg of beer,

710
01:04:02,191 --> 01:04:04,905
will be great fun;
They will destroy the entire house.

711
01:04:05,622 --> 01:04:08,750
- No?
- No, Dad. Amy is very responsible.

712
01:04:10,987 --> 01:04:15,432
Who will be there?
#Maureen, Christine, Amy ... everyone!

713
01:04:16,723 --> 01:04:20,883
Will the guy
on your Facebook page?
#Who?

714
01:04:20,908 --> 01:04:25,599
That is hugging you
and has hair over his eyes.

715
01:04:25,624 --> 01:04:30,313
- Garrett?
- Garrett? So it called?
#Will Garrett there?

716
01:04:31,133 --> 01:04:32,965
- It is probable.
- Probable...

717
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:37,728
I learn more from her
on his Facebook page ...

718
01:04:37,753 --> 01:04:42,151
that his sparkling conversation.
#Is he your boyfriend?

719
01:04:43,336 --> 01:04:46,806
Something like that.
#Do you know him? Have you been in the house?

720
01:04:47,279 --> 01:04:50,427
Sometimes.
#Vece "s"?

721
01:04:52,717 --> 01:04:53,915
Do you have a boyfriend!

722
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:59,416
- Ever heard of Sarah Palin?
- Yes.

723
01:04:59,441 --> 01:05:03,293
What that insurance
you know your 17 year old daughter?

724
01:05:03,676 --> 01:05:08,186
- What are pregnant?
- That's right.
#And what is it that you will not be sure ...

725
01:05:08,211 --> 01:05:10,330
within two years, turned 17?

726
01:05:11,447 --> 01:05:13,079
- Pregnant?
- Exactly.

727
01:05:13,404 --> 01:05:16,447
What are the two
ways to achieve that goal?

728
01:05:16,472 --> 01:05:22,153
The first ... not having
relationships, OK? That's the first.

729
01:05:22,178 --> 01:05:26,157
Do not be ... That did not work
well for your mother and me.

730
01:05:26,382 --> 01:05:29,110
And what is the second?
- Where you going?  - To the bathroom.

731
01:05:29,135 --> 01:05:32,197
No need to go to the bathroom.
Sit, Mason.

732
01:05:33,955 --> 01:05:35,455
What is the second form?

733
01:05:37,838 --> 01:05:40,013
Her mother has not spoken to them about this?

734
01:05:40,038 --> 01:05:44,586
- Dad. - No, seriously.
Do you have talked about ...
#contraceptives?

735
01:05:47,277 --> 01:05:50,134
What? Do you have ...?
Condoms, have you spoken to them about it?

736
01:05:50,159 --> 01:05:53,684
- Dad, please.
- What?
- Stop it, please.  - Garrett has ...?

737
01:05:53,709 --> 01:05:58,299
- God!
- What?
#Sam, we need to talk about this.

738
01:05:58,324 --> 01:05:59,955
Come on, we can.

739
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:03,535
Just hear me out, okay?
It's so hard for me and for you.

740
01:06:03,561 --> 01:06:06,770
Seriously, I read an article
in a newspaper the other day,

741
01:06:06,795 --> 01:06:11,846
saying that although adolescents
USA were not sexually active

742
01:06:11,871 --> 01:06:16,364
have equal rate
highest pregnancy.
#Hello.

743
01:06:16,637 --> 01:06:20,577
- Tammy, how are you?
- Good to see you.
#Yeah, me too.

744
01:06:21,161 --> 01:06:25,209
Tammy, this is my daughter Samantha.
And this son is Mason.

745
01:06:25,435 --> 01:06:28,986
- Saluda.
- Hi.
#Hello, Mason. Encantada.

746
01:06:29,011 --> 01:06:33,396
I've heard of you.
- What are you doing here?  - I'm with friends.

747
01:06:34,721 --> 01:06:37,382
And what are you doing?
#We will camp.

748
01:06:37,517 --> 01:06:41,110
Although she will not go
camp. You go to a party.

749
01:06:42,406 --> 01:06:44,805
- Funny.
- We men, camp.

750
01:06:44,830 --> 01:06:47,805
Males camp. Very well.

751
01:06:48,581 --> 01:06:50,388
Is on for tomorrow?

752
01:06:50,713 --> 01:06:53,780
Yeah. Leave at 7 and I'll call you.

753
01:06:54,505 --> 01:06:57,619
All right. It was a pleasure
meet you both. Bye Bye.

754
01:06:58,043 --> 01:07:00,146
- Bye Bye.
- See you.

755
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:07,085
Do not look like that.
#Well, to end it.

756
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:12,007
I was 23 when you were born.
Y Tu Mama Tambien.

757
01:07:12,032 --> 01:07:16,183
We did not put in the best
situation to be great parents.

758
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:21,127
And I would be a better parent ...
for you two, you know?

759
01:07:22,451 --> 01:07:25,296
And I hope you can
learn from my mistakes.

760
01:07:26,289 --> 01:07:31,137
That is, use a condom.
#Or ... Garrett ... whatever.

761
01:07:39,274 --> 01:07:40,401
Listen to this song.

762
01:07:43,290 --> 01:07:45,181
<I> I wanted to be busy </ i>

763
01:07:45,206 --> 01:07:48,592
Traditional song lyrics and "country"
Traditional old school.

764
01:07:48,617 --> 01:07:51,492
<I> I wash the dishes, short grass </ i>

765
01:07:51,517 --> 01:07:55,565
Listen to the quality of production.
It's like ... "Abbey Road"

766
01:07:55,590 --> 01:07:57,377
<I> tried to keep busy </ i>

767
01:07:59,225 --> 01:08:02,784
<I> Although I know you'll never </ i>

768
01:08:02,809 --> 01:08:06,555
You know, the woman left. Traditional.
#Uncool.

769
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:09,170
<I> I try to keep the house tidy </ i>

770
01:08:12,613 --> 01:08:15,260
<I> I make my bed, change the sheets </ i>

771
01:08:18,711 --> 01:08:22,114
<I> Until I learned to use the washing machine </ i>

772
01:08:23,366 --> 01:08:28,296
<I> Having everything clean does not change anything </ i>

773
01:08:28,321 --> 01:08:32,823
I think I have your expertise.
#Will you seek teaching jobs?

774
01:08:32,848 --> 01:08:35,560
I think what he has done.
#Yeah? Where?

775
01:08:36,226 --> 01:08:38,234
- Everywhere.
- Why all of Texas?

776
01:08:38,259 --> 01:08:42,919
- Yes -. If you have to move
you have to move. It's no big deal.
#We'll handle it.

777
01:08:42,944 --> 01:08:45,242
I'll keep going every two weeks.

778
01:08:45,267 --> 01:08:49,745
If you move at 800 km or so
drive must be longer.

779
01:08:50,152 --> 01:08:53,905
It is not a problem.
- I'm sick of moving.  - Sure.

780
01:08:54,182 --> 01:08:58,767
But you never know.
Maybe I have to move.
#I am working to  an insurance company.

781
01:08:58,792 --> 01:09:02,746
These companies are
bought and sold all the time.
#We will have to accept it.

782
01:09:03,675 --> 01:09:05,402
I thought you were a musician.

783
01:09:05,427 --> 01:09:09,571
I am, but ... Life is expensive, you know.

784
01:09:09,596 --> 01:09:13,495
You have to be responsible.
#What do you think?

785
01:09:16,855 --> 01:09:19,647
Hey, you! What a lack of respect!

786
01:09:25,827 --> 01:09:28,973
And the redhead in the bowling alley?
#Yeah, what's up?

787
01:09:30,198 --> 01:09:33,671
- You know her well?
- We've seen a few times.

788
01:09:35,392 --> 01:09:36,685
Is your girlfriend?

789
01:09:38,310 --> 01:09:39,565
What do you mean?

790
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:42,429
Well ... you've kissed?

791
01:09:46,695 --> 01:09:50,928
Yes. Yeah, I've kissed.
#And you? You have a girlfriend?

792
01:09:51,697 --> 01:09:52,677
Something like that.

793
01:09:54,105 --> 01:09:57,466
Really?
#Did you ... kissed?

794
01:09:58,663 --> 01:09:59,681
No.

795
01:10:01,107 --> 01:10:04,525
What have they done?
- Talk on the phone.  - Clear.

796
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:07,317
- How about that?
- Pretty bad.

797
01:10:08,433 --> 01:10:12,447
Why?
#At school we can  talk about many things, but ...

798
01:10:12,472 --> 01:10:17,463
the phone seems to
we have nothing in common.
#Nothing?

799
01:10:18,432 --> 01:10:21,180
Not interested in music
and electronic games ...

800
01:10:21,265 --> 01:10:23,002
The three best films of the summer.

801
01:10:23,158 --> 01:10:25,751
<I> The Dark Knight, A War
Film and Pineapple Express </ i>

802
01:10:25,776 --> 01:10:29,187
- So?
- It says that all stink!
#What interests you?

803
01:10:29,212 --> 01:10:32,645
I dunno. Go downtown
shopping with their girlfriends silly.

804
01:10:33,376 --> 01:10:35,505
- Is she pretty? Careful there.
- Yes.

805
01:10:37,712 --> 01:10:38,840
Do the following.

806
01:10:41,206 --> 01:10:43,825
First, you're doing a lot of questions.

807
01:10:44,104 --> 01:10:48,225
And then you have to listen to
responses. Demonstrate interest in her.

808
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:52,280
If you can do that you will
light years ahead of the others.

809
01:10:53,023 --> 01:10:57,998
It is the best merengue
soft roast my life.
#It is awesome. I look at it.

810
01:10:58,022 --> 01:11:00,289
Light brown, without burns ...

811
01:11:00,314 --> 01:11:03,151
What could be sold in a store.

812
01:11:04,079 --> 01:11:08,298
Worth a commercial.
- Worthy of an ad.  - Yes.

813
01:11:10,547 --> 01:11:13,110
Do you think it will take another
Star Wars?

814
01:11:13,135 --> 01:11:16,072
I dunno. If they made another ...

815
01:11:16,097 --> 01:11:19,711
should be in the game period.

816
01:11:19,736 --> 01:11:21,996
- Then there is nothing.
- Yes.

817
01:11:22,354 --> 01:11:25,626
- Return of the Jedi was finished.
- There's nothing else to do.

818
01:11:25,651 --> 01:11:28,133
You can transform
Hans Only a Sith lord.

819
01:11:30,717 --> 01:11:34,877
<I> If I could leave this motorway </ i>

820
01:11:34,902 --> 01:11:38,121
<I> Without me killed or caught </ i>

821
01:11:38,456 --> 01:11:43,202
<I> I will walk on that road
in a cloud of smoke </ i>

822
01:11:43,227 --> 01:11:47,823
<I> to a land
ever, I have never bought </ i>

823
01:12:01,056 --> 01:12:05,599
- Good day.
- Good.
- Do you have to pee?  - Yes.

824
01:12:06,119 --> 01:12:10,118
Aim the fire.
#Custom ... old native.

825
01:12:10,143 --> 01:12:14,318
Give the earth what it took.
#And while not the forest fire risk.

826
01:12:27,335 --> 01:12:30,095
Good. Have a good time.

827
01:12:30,229 --> 01:12:33,900
Mason, do not forget. I have a class
later today. Sam will you find.

828
01:12:33,925 --> 01:12:37,241
- Yes, Sam?
- Yes.
- Bye Bye!  - See you.

829
01:12:44,841 --> 01:12:47,437
Hello.
#Is that all you got?

830
01:12:47,462 --> 01:12:49,715
Good luck with that.

831
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:13,187
- Do not push me! Putita.
- I did not.
#Are you saying I'm lying?

832
01:13:13,512 --> 01:13:17,156
No.
#Do not be evil, motherfucker.

833
01:13:18,178 --> 01:13:20,608
It seems that the baby
Cute is not very good.

834
01:13:21,522 --> 01:13:23,242
Do not touch me, fagot!

835
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:29,210
You're an asshole.

836
01:13:47,754 --> 01:13:50,211
Hello, Mason!
#Hi, Jill.

837
01:13:51,667 --> 01:13:55,122
Where are you going?
#To university.

838
01:13:55,147 --> 01:13:59,416
What happens there?
- My mom taught.  - Good.

839
01:13:59,441 --> 01:14:02,844
- What does it teach?
- Psychology, I think.

840
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:09,044
What do you do?
#My mom owns Neilworks.  Are the artists and artisans.

841
01:14:09,069 --> 01:14:13,108
So I'm walking around.
#I have to go to the hospital soon.

842
01:14:13,133 --> 01:14:15,782
Why?
#Do you know Courtney?

843
01:14:16,043 --> 01:14:20,567
The girl with dyed hair
black and a nose ring?
#Use halter neck ever ...

844
01:14:20,592 --> 01:14:21,762
I think so.

845
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:26,287
We were best friends,
but we have drifted apart.

846
01:14:26,312 --> 01:14:28,776
He became very emo,
I believe very snobbish, but ...

847
01:14:28,801 --> 01:14:32,048
still consider you my friend.
#Well, she cut one of his wrists.

848
01:14:32,073 --> 01:14:36,338
I do not know the seriousness,
but I think I should visit.
#What are you reading?

849
01:14:37,077 --> 01:14:39,866
"Breakfast of Champions"
Kurt Vonnegut.

850
01:14:40,714 --> 01:14:42,623
I think he likes my big brother.

851
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:47,744
I'm reading
"To Kill a Mockingbird" for the third time.
#My friends tease me.

852
01:14:47,769 --> 01:14:51,684
I must be the only girl in school
did not read the Twilight books.

853
01:14:51,852 --> 01:14:53,757
- Do you read?
- Of course not.

854
01:14:54,248 --> 01:14:57,552
I tried ... but it was so cheesy!

855
01:14:58,844 --> 01:15:02,013
How about San Marcos?
#It's okay.

856
01:15:02,138 --> 01:15:05,419
It is much smaller
Houston, but not bad.

857
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:09,032
- Have you always lived here?
- Yes.

858
01:15:09,057 --> 01:15:13,138
If you want a big city here,
you have to go to San Antonio or Austin.

859
01:15:13,163 --> 01:15:14,201
Do you know?

860
01:15:14,845 --> 01:15:18,852
I went to San Antonio
for the day, but not Austin.

861
01:15:20,284 --> 01:15:24,332
It's where the big kids go.
#Weekends, for concerts and stuff.

862
01:15:24,357 --> 01:15:28,231
So I've been told.
#Are you going to the party  Shawna next weekend?

863
01:15:29,105 --> 01:15:33,540
Something I heard, but I'm not sure.
- You should.  - Why?

864
01:15:33,977 --> 01:15:37,839
Nana's crazy about you
and I know he wants you.

865
01:15:38,544 --> 01:15:41,747
Do not have a girlfriend, right?
#Not at the time.

866
01:15:41,972 --> 01:15:46,273
Well, you must come.
- I'll call first for  sure you are. - OK.

867
01:15:46,444 --> 01:15:49,751
Do not tell Nana
I said that. It would kill me.
#I will not.

868
01:15:50,851 --> 01:15:53,292
- I have to go. See you.
- Bye Bye.

869
01:15:57,064 --> 01:16:01,398
Their cognitive series.
His interviews with orphans.

870
01:16:02,103 --> 01:16:04,022
His work ethology.

871
01:16:04,047 --> 01:16:07,367
And then he, in turn,
was supported by ...

872
01:16:07,392 --> 01:16:09,473
study
Rhesus macaques Harry Harlow.

873
01:16:09,498 --> 01:16:13,603
Think it was the decade
1950 It was something radical!

874
01:16:13,723 --> 01:16:16,669
This contradicted
to the classical theory of learning ...

875
01:16:16,694 --> 01:16:19,952
conditioning
B.F. classic Skinner.

876
01:16:21,046 --> 01:16:23,429
Bowlby argued that ...

877
01:16:23,654 --> 01:16:28,049
human survival
depends on us fall in love.

878
01:16:28,074 --> 01:16:32,360
Depends on who I love with my mom.

879
01:16:32,385 --> 01:16:37,019
And my mother was in love with me.
#And if it does not,

880
01:16:37,852 --> 01:16:39,271
we are doomed.

881
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:44,487
Think about it. A tiger runs
our tribe through the cave.

882
01:16:44,978 --> 01:16:49,682
An ideal mother
"My baby! I love you!'ll Protect you!"

883
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:54,460
Or "You? For what I'll
to help? I entorpecers you. "

884
01:16:54,485 --> 01:16:56,769
"You ... tiger food."

885
01:16:58,570 --> 01:17:02,445
Next week we'll talk
of the four stages of Bowlby's attachment.

886
01:17:03,901 --> 01:17:06,395
Some of you
have class with Elena.

887
01:17:06,420 --> 01:17:10,068
She and I will host
a meeting at my house.

888
01:17:10,093 --> 01:17:12,507
Whoever wants to come, welcome.

889
01:17:13,609 --> 01:17:15,150
I'm not a great cook.

890
01:17:26,556 --> 01:17:27,584
Samantha!

891
01:17:29,972 --> 01:17:33,720
Why the hell
You were not your brother?
#I know what you're gonna say ...

892
01:17:34,471 --> 01:17:37,088
She was late
and we could not turn around.

893
01:17:37,113 --> 01:17:41,079
No excuses! Specifically no
did what you said you would do.

894
01:17:41,104 --> 01:17:42,658
You left your brother!

895
01:17:42,846 --> 01:17:46,149
I am ashamed
ask my friend to turn around and ...

896
01:17:46,174 --> 01:17:50,837
go find a child of eight.
#How does a child? He's your brother!

897
01:17:50,862 --> 01:17:53,167
You know, we would ask before Janie.

898
01:17:53,192 --> 01:17:56,986
The school is
around the corner, it's no problem.
#Forgiveness.

899
01:17:58,066 --> 01:18:01,977
You have to start
thinking about who you want to be.

900
01:18:02,002 --> 01:18:06,897
Want to be a person
cooperating and has compassion,

901
01:18:06,922 --> 01:18:10,252
that helps people?
Or do you want to be a callous egomaniac?

902
01:18:10,677 --> 01:18:16,063
You're right. I am a person
horrible, but he's not a baby anymore.

903
01:18:16,088 --> 01:18:18,111
And you should treat it as such.

904
01:18:18,136 --> 01:18:21,855
It is in the eighth grade and ...
You can only get home if you like.

905
01:18:22,352 --> 01:18:26,008
You know what? When Gabby
you can go and have a talk.

906
01:18:30,732 --> 01:18:34,305
- Cornered!
- That sucks.

907
01:18:42,306 --> 01:18:47,122
- What about?
- Camp tonight.
- Are you coming?  - Who is going?

908
01:18:47,247 --> 01:18:50,354
My brother, one of
Tony and his friends ... maybe.

909
01:18:51,674 --> 01:18:53,187
I ask my mother.

910
01:18:55,551 --> 01:18:59,448
Mom, I can go camping with Chase today?
#Where?

911
01:18:59,574 --> 01:19:02,886
The home being built
his family. It is almost finished.

912
01:19:03,148 --> 01:19:07,068
Will there be ... adult?
#Your brother is older.

913
01:19:07,809 --> 01:19:11,122
- Do you have your phone?
- Yes.
#Burdened?

914
01:19:11,147 --> 01:19:14,998
Get the telephone number
and direction of their parents on the counter.

915
01:19:18,403 --> 01:19:20,745
That! Way to go!

916
01:19:23,195 --> 01:19:25,726
Not bad. But this will be supreme.

917
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:29,573
Let's see what
I can do. This is your face.

918
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:31,387
Break his face here.

919
01:19:36,712 --> 01:19:39,764
Okay, now look at this.
Better get moving.

920
01:19:52,395 --> 01:19:53,578
Look at this.

921
01:19:59,198 --> 01:20:01,764
This stuff is lethal.
#It would be very painful.

922
01:20:01,889 --> 01:20:06,491
A beer. It was very good.
#Brewing time.

923
01:20:09,075 --> 01:20:11,585
No thanks.
#Bring it on.

924
01:20:12,435 --> 01:20:16,499
Are you a fag?
#I do not like drinking beer.

925
01:20:16,788 --> 01:20:21,779
If you cringe a beer,
sure you ever fucked a girl.

926
01:20:22,447 --> 01:20:25,603
- You okay?
- Clear.
#When?

927
01:20:26,203 --> 01:20:28,021
- In the summer.
- Who?

928
01:20:28,387 --> 01:20:31,986
Chase and made easy
grabbed Nancy Hooker.

929
01:20:32,011 --> 01:20:36,309
- Thus says.
- It was. Would I lie?
#Do not make up. Quick, where were you?

930
01:20:36,334 --> 01:20:39,438
At Tober.
She was with a couple of other types.

931
01:20:39,763 --> 01:20:42,900
His debut was with a used!

932
01:20:44,316 --> 01:20:48,962
And you, Mason? Have you already taken?
#Already hit him cry that night?

933
01:20:50,153 --> 01:20:54,194
- Sometimes.
- Really?
#You sure. How was it?

934
01:20:54,319 --> 01:20:55,370
Manuela ?

935
01:20:57,203 --> 01:21:01,528
No ... Jennifer.
#Not here. It was in Houston.

936
01:21:01,553 --> 01:21:04,860
Lie!
#I do not care if you do not believe me.

937
01:21:04,885 --> 01:21:07,464
In other words, in Houston you were the big male ...

938
01:21:07,489 --> 01:21:09,389
but to get here ... left foot!

939
01:21:09,963 --> 01:21:12,981
Fuck you! I would,
but the girls here do not want.

940
01:21:13,006 --> 01:21:16,935
It's not what they want!
It's what you want.
#Truth.

941
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:21,154
You know what?
Join a band and go.

942
01:21:21,179 --> 01:21:24,926
- Yes?
- Of course!
#You do not even have to play well.

943
01:21:24,951 --> 01:21:28,543
You start to play your instrument
and the girls line up to suck your dick.

944
01:21:28,785 --> 01:21:33,240
But not you.
The ladies do not care so much ...
#who plays the flute in the band.

945
01:21:33,265 --> 01:21:37,173
I'm not in the marching band!
#Are you sure?  I heard you played the flute of meat!

946
01:21:38,773 --> 01:21:40,101
I ask a question.

947
01:21:40,126 --> 01:21:44,070
If they are so great, why are
three idiots on a Friday night?

948
01:21:44,095 --> 01:21:48,785
Shut up, Forrito.
You're lucky to be here.
#It is our camp.

949
01:21:48,810 --> 01:21:50,840
The only reason
why you are here ...

950
01:21:50,865 --> 01:21:54,279
is the mother of Charlie
forced to bring the setting of his brother,

951
01:21:54,304 --> 01:21:58,475
and he brought you
two fucking assholes.
#Fucking assholes!

952
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:02,855
All right.
#These children will  his chance soon.

953
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:06,912
Later whores come.
- Yes?  - That's it!

954
01:22:06,937 --> 01:22:11,330
I know Chase is caught anything.
#I've seen clutching the walls.

955
01:22:11,455 --> 01:22:15,383
What about you two? Can score?
#What ever.

956
01:22:16,696 --> 01:22:20,719
And you, great blower?
#I dunno. Perhaps.

957
01:22:20,744 --> 01:22:25,113
All good if you're gay.
Understand. But sleeping there.

958
01:22:27,107 --> 01:22:30,451
I'm not gay.
#Give it time. Now you will notice.

959
01:22:30,476 --> 01:22:34,052
Fuck you!
#That's what I said!

960
01:22:34,077 --> 01:22:38,717
There are whores. The we were
fucking to see what they said.

961
01:22:38,742 --> 01:22:41,998
Achieve a badge.
#Put it next to your card bitch.

962
01:22:42,023 --> 01:22:47,014
Because you're a whore. Take this.
- As little whore.  - Putita!

963
01:22:48,281 --> 01:22:51,011
This is called the stroke of death.

964
01:23:04,416 --> 01:23:05,983
Came! What good.

965
01:23:10,844 --> 01:23:15,501
Here, hostess.
#Thank you. Something to eat?

966
01:23:15,526 --> 01:23:19,998
- Good.
- Thank you.
- You did?  - Yes.

967
01:23:21,627 --> 01:23:24,087
- How long do you work?
- Not much.

968
01:23:25,296 --> 01:23:29,029
After the summer camp.
#Is there a camp for graffiti?

969
01:23:29,425 --> 01:23:33,707
They call it street art.
#To look less illegal, but ...

970
01:23:34,444 --> 01:23:38,719
actually serves to
get free spray paint.
#Great.

971
01:23:38,944 --> 01:23:42,167
This is your label?
So ... just call it ...?

972
01:23:42,192 --> 01:23:45,342
Yes, but they are only letters,
what I can do.

973
01:23:52,299 --> 01:23:54,949
"Kecjo".
#Great.

974
01:23:54,974 --> 01:23:57,053
It means nothing.

975
01:24:00,102 --> 01:24:04,926
- Is your dad?
- Yes.
- Where do you live?  - In Houston.

976
01:24:05,515 --> 01:24:10,016
Do you see him often?
#Some weekends and in the summer.

977
01:24:11,151 --> 01:24:13,275
You are a student of my mom, right?

978
01:24:14,322 --> 01:24:18,634
Yes, it's me ... I have a class with her.
#It is good.

979
01:24:18,759 --> 01:24:21,762
How do you do? Are you a good teacher?

980
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:26,275
Very good! Very clever
and ... he cares about things.

981
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:30,433
Makes class interesting.
#Probably my favorite teacher.

982
01:24:32,562 --> 01:24:37,190
We found a way to amplify
our iPods in the car.

983
01:24:37,215 --> 01:24:40,456
When we reached a village,
knew that the 456 was there ...

984
01:24:40,481 --> 01:24:43,851
because we were jumping,
jump here, jump there.

985
01:24:44,412 --> 01:24:47,383
Out the entire family.
Were the kids and ...

986
01:24:47,408 --> 01:24:52,158
mother and father and jumped all.
#We threw candy to the kids,

987
01:24:52,183 --> 01:24:55,335
soccer balls, dolls and frisbees.

988
01:24:56,231 --> 01:25:00,855
Cigarettes for adults and ...
really loved the Gatorade.

989
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:05,398
But for some reason,
hated the lemon-lime flavor.
#I do not know what happened.

990
01:25:06,536 --> 01:25:09,532
Or given away.
#How long were you there?

991
01:25:09,957 --> 01:25:13,081
Two periods of service
in Iraq and one in Bosnia.

992
01:25:14,527 --> 01:25:15,685
You enlist?

993
01:25:17,407 --> 01:25:22,021
Yes, I was in the Guard
National barely finished high school.

994
01:25:22,046 --> 01:25:26,539
Needed money to
college and paid well.
#I did my tour of duty.

995
01:25:26,564 --> 01:25:30,558
At the end, I said, 'I will return if
something happens to change the world. "

996
01:25:31,477 --> 01:25:34,965
Three months later
what happened to the twin towers and back.

997
01:25:36,391 --> 01:25:39,734
And I'm proud that throughout the
time I was there with the 456,

998
01:25:39,759 --> 01:25:44,063
never lost anyone, not one.
#That's weird, unusual?

999
01:25:44,588 --> 01:25:47,866
Yes.
#Almost impossible.

1000
01:25:48,348 --> 01:25:51,340
Those who came to replace us ...

1001
01:25:51,365 --> 01:25:56,324
They did not hear our
advice. They did everything backwards.

1002
01:25:56,349 --> 01:25:58,708
And they lost
seven soldiers in the first month.

1003
01:26:00,641 --> 01:26:02,496
What that
you did differently?

1004
01:26:03,834 --> 01:26:06,771
I like to think is
a matter of mutual respect.

1005
01:26:07,484 --> 01:26:10,066
All the time
dedicated to establishing trust,

1006
01:26:10,715 --> 01:26:15,713
they destroyed it in three days.
#According to the natives,  Why are we there?

1007
01:26:17,466 --> 01:26:19,489
Oil. Plain and simple.

1008
01:27:09,970 --> 01:27:13,250
Mason!
#Arrived.

1009
01:27:21,741 --> 01:27:24,813
Hey! Kids Club!
Already out of the car.

1010
01:27:24,838 --> 01:27:27,717
Crawl out the window
back or whatever.

1011
01:27:35,062 --> 01:27:38,356
I'll miss you.
#See you Sunday night.

1012
01:27:38,881 --> 01:27:40,608
Send me text messages.

1013
01:27:44,850 --> 01:27:46,196
Do you have any gum?

1014
01:27:48,176 --> 01:27:51,865
Yes. Here.
#Thank you. See you.

1015
01:27:53,479 --> 01:27:55,449
Accept the account
Party to be ...

1016
01:27:55,474 --> 01:27:58,169
guilt and redemption
their own retirement, as if ...

1017
01:27:58,194 --> 01:27:59,984
whatever that corrupts this country.

1018
01:28:10,386 --> 01:28:15,143
Hello, Mason. What time is it?
#Type ... 12 and 15.

1019
01:28:16,762 --> 01:28:17,778
Happy Birthday.

1020
01:28:19,042 --> 01:28:23,846
Happy Birthday!
#Mason! Is it your birthday?

1021
01:28:24,392 --> 01:28:28,022
Right now, it seems.
- How old are you?  - 15.

1022
01:28:29,781 --> 01:28:34,038
A hug!
#Happy Birthday. Wow!

1023
01:28:37,583 --> 01:28:41,162
Have you drunk?
#And you?

1024
01:28:41,576 --> 01:28:43,674
A little. And you?

1025
01:28:44,829 --> 01:28:45,763
A little bit.

1026
01:28:46,902 --> 01:28:47,986
Do you also have ...?

1027
01:28:49,123 --> 01:28:50,467
A little bit.

1028
01:28:54,196 --> 01:28:55,484
I'm going to sleep.

1029
01:28:58,526 --> 01:28:59,973
We talk in the morning, okay?

1030
01:29:01,553 --> 01:29:02,640
Dad!

1031
01:29:03,831 --> 01:29:07,861
How are you?
- Who owns the car?  - It's ours.

1032
01:29:07,886 --> 01:29:10,720
Hop.
- Hello!  - Hey, baby.

1033
01:29:14,241 --> 01:29:17,398
Hello, Cooper!
#How's it going?

1034
01:29:17,923 --> 01:29:20,951
Hello, brother. It's so cute.

1035
01:29:20,976 --> 01:29:23,379
Can not we replace
that part of the pipe?

1036
01:29:23,404 --> 01:29:26,055
No, not work. Everything is in disrepair.

1037
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:28,650
- Everything all?
- Yes, everything. Mira.

1038
01:29:33,182 --> 01:29:37,046
This is ...
- Stronger?  - It's better. Yeah yeah.

1039
01:29:38,125 --> 01:29:40,439
Thanks for the camera
that you gave to Mason.

1040
01:29:40,860 --> 01:29:43,592
- A Mason likes photography.
- Yes.

1041
01:29:43,617 --> 01:29:48,175
He says he wants to transform
her closet in a dark room.

1042
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:50,433
Red light and revealed. Everything.

1043
01:29:50,458 --> 01:29:55,142
- Do not you have problem?
- I will not see him for a week.
#He's having fun.

1044
01:29:55,260 --> 01:29:58,308
At least he is focused on something.
#I like that.

1045
01:29:58,433 --> 01:30:01,814
This on its own.
#OK, on ??to the "large".

1046
01:30:01,839 --> 01:30:04,214
It's good. It is better, yes.

1047
01:30:10,268 --> 01:30:12,027
You're smart, you should be studying.

1048
01:30:13,733 --> 01:30:18,344
I like the study,
I need it, but ...
#It's hard. I work all day ...

1049
01:30:19,159 --> 01:30:23,191
Go to night school! Education
Community tertiary. It is not expensive.

1050
01:30:23,216 --> 01:30:27,379
Good job with the house. Looks great.
- Thank you.  - Very well.

1051
01:30:27,404 --> 01:30:32,252
We fix here and there.
We got it cheap at auction.
#Now I know why.

1052
01:30:34,562 --> 01:30:38,018
- Happy Birthday!
- What about that?
#It's our new car!

1053
01:30:38,343 --> 01:30:41,594
Come up.
#Have a good weekend.

1054
01:30:42,836 --> 01:30:46,307
- Hello!
- How you doing?
- Good to see you.  - Me too.

1055
01:30:48,684 --> 01:30:49,626
How are you?

1056
01:30:52,050 --> 01:30:56,680
You look great. Look!
#Mason's nose!

1057
01:30:59,704 --> 01:31:02,745
Ready! We have long journey ahead.

1058
01:31:02,770 --> 01:31:05,009
- Goodbye, Sam!
- Drive carefully!

1059
01:31:06,634 --> 01:31:10,775
We'll be back tomorrow night.
#Bye, honey.  I'm glad you were born!

1060
01:31:26,974 --> 01:31:30,239
This is the car ... Annie
And do you drive a Pontiac GTO?

1061
01:31:31,264 --> 01:31:33,476
Baby seats do not go with the other.

1062
01:31:34,753 --> 01:31:38,543
No. Just what I had to sell.
#What?

1063
01:31:39,272 --> 01:31:40,975
Yes, I had to sell.

1064
01:31:42,035 --> 01:31:43,460
And ... you no longer have?

1065
01:31:44,044 --> 01:31:47,527
A collector
California paid me $ 22,000.

1066
01:31:47,552 --> 01:31:50,404
Me fine because
I paid it in cash.

1067
01:31:50,429 --> 01:31:53,114
He had paid $ 8500 ages ago.

1068
01:31:53,593 --> 01:31:55,782
In general, cars
They are terrible investments.

1069
01:31:55,807 --> 01:31:58,899
You take it out of the agency
and you get a used car,

1070
01:31:58,928 --> 01:32:03,105
and then on the value decreases.
#But, if cared for,

1071
01:32:04,140 --> 01:32:07,760
and you're lucky and it's a classic,
the price goes up.

1072
01:32:07,785 --> 01:32:11,858
Some people pay hundreds of thousands
dollars for a Ford Shelby Cobra.

1073
01:32:17,482 --> 01:32:20,570
What?
#Do not you remember?

1074
01:32:22,756 --> 01:32:24,825
What do I remember?
#Really?

1075
01:32:28,323 --> 01:32:30,902
You told me
It would be mine when I turned 16.

1076
01:32:31,815 --> 01:32:36,330
What? No, never said that.
#I remember. I was in third grade,

1077
01:32:36,355 --> 01:32:39,849
and you were carrying me to the house of
Anthony Nagar because it was his birthday.

1078
01:32:40,118 --> 01:32:42,858
We took a few laps because
We had arrived early.

1079
01:32:45,008 --> 01:32:47,607
"It will be of Mason when he turns 16."

1080
01:32:50,452 --> 01:32:54,618
First, I do not remember saying that.
Second, never say something. Never.

1081
01:32:55,235 --> 01:32:56,379
But you did.

1082
01:32:58,136 --> 01:32:59,472
Mason ...

1083
01:33:00,484 --> 01:33:04,664
And your sister?
Was I going to forget it?
#Come on. Is that fair?

1084
01:33:10,256 --> 01:33:11,754
Come on!

1085
01:33:13,450 --> 01:33:14,575
You can not ...

1086
01:33:19,181 --> 01:33:23,841
You can put a face
burial if you want.
#But the issue is simple:it was my car.

1087
01:33:23,866 --> 01:33:27,834
I bought it, I took care of him,
I did what I wanted with it.

1088
01:33:29,045 --> 01:33:30,763
I'm sorry if you had other hopes.

1089
01:33:30,788 --> 01:33:33,789
But when you're older you'll
save up and buy your own car.

1090
01:33:33,814 --> 01:33:35,459
And being "cool" as I was.

1091
01:33:37,467 --> 01:33:39,619
Or ... you can buy a van.

1092
01:33:54,053 --> 01:33:56,366
Your mom lets you look at this?

1093
01:34:10,328 --> 01:34:14,547
Did you have seen live?
#No, but comes to Houston in April.

1094
01:34:14,572 --> 01:34:15,851
Are you coming to Houston?

1095
01:34:16,416 --> 01:34:21,260
We can get you tickets
and you can stay with us.
- It would be great!  - Yes.

1096
01:34:25,625 --> 01:34:29,345
Annie, will you pass me
holds for the gift from Mason?

1097
01:34:29,370 --> 01:34:33,324
- Here, honey.
- Need a little explanation.

1098
01:34:34,746 --> 01:34:35,662
Open it.

1099
01:34:37,102 --> 01:34:41,722
I call it "The disk
black Beatles ".
#As it is ...

1100
01:34:41,747 --> 01:34:45,886
Best of John, George,
Paul and Ringo after separation.

1101
01:34:46,459 --> 01:34:49,945
Thank you.
#In short,  gather the band for you.

1102
01:34:49,970 --> 01:34:53,473
When you hear a lot of what
they did solo, bored.

1103
01:34:53,798 --> 01:34:58,442
But you put next to each other,
and mutually rise.

1104
01:34:58,467 --> 01:35:01,321
And then you realize.
#Are The Beatles!

1105
01:35:02,104 --> 01:35:04,960
I dunno. I think Paul always preferred.

1106
01:35:05,104 --> 01:35:07,250
It does not matter. You do not understand the idea.

1107
01:35:07,275 --> 01:35:11,330
No favorite Beatle! That is
what I say. The issue is balance.

1108
01:35:11,355 --> 01:35:14,701
That was what made hooker
rock band the world's largest!

1109
01:35:15,626 --> 01:35:18,991
There are a decade
music that was dispersed.

1110
01:35:19,316 --> 01:35:23,294
It has been carefully located,
organized and neat for you ...

1111
01:35:23,319 --> 01:35:24,967
by your loving dad.

1112
01:35:25,292 --> 01:35:29,487
Very organized and neat
several times by your loving dad.

1113
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:32,183
Sure! Yes! Look at this. Look at this.

1114
01:35:32,919 --> 01:35:34,932
The first four issues of volume 2.

1115
01:35:34,957 --> 01:35:39,121
From "Band on the Run" to "My Sweet Lord"
a "jealous type" to "Photography".

1116
01:35:39,146 --> 01:35:42,138
Hello!
#It's the perfect transition!

1117
01:35:42,163 --> 01:35:46,147
Paul takes you to a party.
George talks to you about God.

1118
01:35:46,172 --> 01:35:49,494
John says
"It is not, about love and pain."

1119
01:35:49,529 --> 01:35:53,870
And Ringo says "Can not we enjoy
what we have in the moment "?

1120
01:35:54,891 --> 01:35:58,474
- It's a good album. Really.
- Great.

1121
01:36:25,121 --> 01:36:27,976
- Hi, Cliff!
- Hello! How are you?

1122
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:31,488
- Good to see you!
- Good to see you.

1123
01:36:38,359 --> 01:36:39,992
- Put the icing.
- Wait!

1124
01:36:41,721 --> 01:36:42,717
Sam!

1125
01:36:44,142 --> 01:36:47,541
Come on.
#Are they still asleep?

1126
01:37:13,059 --> 01:37:14,483
A wish, a wish!

1127
01:37:18,851 --> 01:37:21,397
Gifts! Wait!
Here, honey.

1128
01:37:21,618 --> 01:37:24,182
Sam, could you bring
a knife to cut this?

1129
01:37:26,043 --> 01:37:28,999
Hope you like it.
I heard you did not have one, so ...

1130
01:37:29,124 --> 01:37:33,876
A Bible! Is this your first Bible!
#With your name.

1131
01:37:35,336 --> 01:37:36,577
Wait, wait.

1132
01:37:38,308 --> 01:37:42,403
It's a red letter edition. So it
Jesus says everything is red.

1133
01:37:42,917 --> 01:37:46,990
- Thank you.
- Do you like it? Very well.
#Honey, happy birthday.

1134
01:37:47,041 --> 01:37:48,352
And this is ours.

1135
01:37:50,180 --> 01:37:54,726
It is no dream. Lower your expectations.

1136
01:37:54,951 --> 01:37:59,825
No, but you need it. It is a ...
#You have to have! You need it.

1137
01:38:00,841 --> 01:38:03,419
- A lifetime ahead.
- And the shirt is blue.

1138
01:38:03,444 --> 01:38:07,052
Dance ... job interviews ...
I'm going to wrinkle.

1139
01:38:08,238 --> 01:38:11,117
Mason.
#Come here, son.

1140
01:38:18,753 --> 01:38:19,962
Desenfndala.

1141
01:38:22,325 --> 01:38:24,179
It is a 20 gauge shotgun.

1142
01:38:25,672 --> 01:38:28,915
My dad gave me when
I was a little younger than you.

1143
01:38:29,140 --> 01:38:33,903
His father had given it.
#You're 15 and I want to be yours.

1144
01:38:34,328 --> 01:38:37,595
What good.
#Hold.

1145
01:38:40,010 --> 01:38:41,043
Thank you.

1146
01:38:41,068 --> 01:38:45,022
Congratulations, son.
I'll teach you to clean it and shoot it.

1147
01:38:47,046 --> 01:38:50,285
I'll show you a little security.
#Amartllala.

1148
01:38:51,284 --> 01:38:55,622
What you want is to align
the front with the rear.
#Do you see the little "v"?

1149
01:38:55,647 --> 01:38:59,596
- Which would you sign?
- A can of medium.
#Is the middle? All right.

1150
01:39:00,021 --> 01:39:01,324
Shoot discretion.

1151
01:39:05,997 --> 01:39:08,356
Care. Be careful. Very well.

1152
01:39:09,881 --> 01:39:10,836
Ready?

1153
01:39:15,856 --> 01:39:17,679
You shot a little low.

1154
01:39:17,704 --> 01:39:21,728
Expected to rise and then shoot.
It is best when down.

1155
01:39:24,902 --> 01:39:26,968
Remember, the second trigger.

1156
01:39:40,542 --> 01:39:42,550
- How do you feel?
- All right.

1157
01:39:44,381 --> 01:39:47,228
<I> offer to be together forever </ i>

1158
01:39:47,253 --> 01:39:49,786
<I> A great, wherever you are </ i>

1159
01:39:49,811 --> 01:39:53,519
<I> want to be easy and informal </ i>

1160
01:39:53,944 --> 01:39:56,142
<I> But still the man who is </ i>

1161
01:39:56,667 --> 01:40:02,110
<I> Well, you know we
remain as mysterious </ i>

1162
01:40:02,635 --> 01:40:07,225
<I> believe all deeply
but always without fear </ i>

1163
01:40:07,950 --> 01:40:11,276
<I> Scroll to the top, look down from the ledge </ i>

1164
01:40:11,601 --> 01:40:14,244
<I> And dance barefoot
on the razor's edge </ i>

1165
01:40:14,568 --> 01:40:17,388
<I> Dreaming big,
get into something dangerous </ i>

1166
01:40:17,713 --> 01:40:20,340
<I> If I try never will fail </ i>

1167
01:40:20,665 --> 01:40:23,456
<I> If you ever strip house dice </ i>

1168
01:40:23,781 --> 01:40:26,409
<I> should not get wet twice in the river </ i>

1169
01:40:26,734 --> 01:40:29,505
<I> If you love becomes hate too </ i>

1170
01:40:29,729 --> 01:40:32,336
<I> If you never go home you
Later you'll never </ i>

1171
01:40:32,761 --> 01:40:35,520
<I> If you eat too much you get fat </ i>

1172
01:40:35,746 --> 01:40:38,601
<I> If you buy a dog cat angry </ i>

1173
01:40:38,926 --> 01:40:41,641
<I> Take a deep breath and enjoy the ride </ i>

1174
01:40:41,766 --> 01:40:47,715
<I> For arrivals and
headings are parallel </ i>

1175
01:40:49,540 --> 01:40:51,567
They are our first audience.

1176
01:40:53,348 --> 01:40:58,217
Mason demanded
rehearse it on the road.
- Admirable  - Lacks work.

1177
01:40:58,342 --> 01:41:01,959
A week later - do not know
why Thomas was not at first -

1178
01:41:02,484 --> 01:41:05,915
but a week
later, Tom returns ...

1179
01:41:05,940 --> 01:41:07,706
and goes with the other disciples.

1180
01:41:07,731 --> 01:41:11,285
They say:"The Lord is alive,
! So we have seen! "" I do not believe,

1181
01:41:11,310 --> 01:41:16,049
"Until they put my hand into his side,
"And feel the wounds in his hand."

1182
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:20,128
Just then arrives
Jesus stands beside him.

1183
01:41:21,293 --> 01:41:24,654
And look at Thomas.
Do you see the shame he felt Thomas?

1184
01:41:25,079 --> 01:41:29,307
Thomas looks at him and says:
"Thomas, put your hand in my side."

1185
01:41:29,889 --> 01:41:32,049
"Look at my wounds.'s Me"!

1186
01:41:32,674 --> 01:41:36,706
And Thomas says:
"My Lord and my God. Thing I think."

1187
01:41:36,893 --> 01:41:39,175
And Jesus said, "That's good."

1188
01:41:39,935 --> 01:41:43,513
"But blessed
those who believe without seeing. "

1189
01:41:49,536 --> 01:41:52,825
In our case,
we have not seen in person.

1190
01:41:52,926 --> 01:41:54,810
We have not felt in person.

1191
01:41:54,835 --> 01:41:59,729
But we have felt
in our spirit; less so.
#And I hope you do too.

1192
01:42:01,386 --> 01:42:02,870
The lagoon is here.

1193
01:42:06,870 --> 01:42:09,292
- What floor!
- Yes.

1194
01:42:10,371 --> 01:42:13,147
My dad can take them
to fish next time.

1195
01:42:21,618 --> 01:42:24,483
- I'll wait here.
- You want me to stay?

1196
01:42:24,608 --> 01:42:27,246
- No, it's fine. - You sure?
- Yes, thank you.

1197
01:42:33,133 --> 01:42:35,719
Mason, why are so outdated?

1198
01:42:36,756 --> 01:42:38,444
Neither know what you're talking about.

1199
01:42:38,469 --> 01:42:42,368
Do not they care back
day 20 for the baptism of Cooper?

1200
01:42:42,393 --> 01:42:47,269
- No problem.
- Sam?
#Thank you.  It means a lot to Annie and her family.

1201
01:42:50,770 --> 01:42:52,410
Were we baptized us?

1202
01:42:55,139 --> 01:42:58,334
It was not for nothing
interested in the condition of your soul.

1203
01:42:59,170 --> 01:43:03,002
What can we do now,
if you want. You and Cooper together?

1204
01:43:03,527 --> 01:43:04,918
Heads submerged?

1205
01:43:05,998 --> 01:43:10,334
Are not you'll become
a man of God, right Dad?
#What does that mean?

1206
01:43:10,759 --> 01:43:11,990
I hear!

1207
01:43:14,295 --> 01:43:18,483
I think the shotgun
will be better at home.
#Your mother will not like it.

1208
01:43:21,657 --> 01:43:24,040
Watch out, Sam. I'll show you how.

1209
01:43:28,165 --> 01:43:29,232
Well, Dad!

1210
01:43:30,324 --> 01:43:31,590
Even I can!

1211
01:43:45,355 --> 01:43:49,230
- How long have you been here, Mason?
- I'm not sure.

1212
01:43:49,835 --> 01:43:52,725
I have. Whole class.

1213
01:43:53,354 --> 01:43:56,574
- Did you finish your picture diary?
- Not yet.

1214
01:43:57,165 --> 01:43:59,428
And your digital contact sheet?

1215
01:43:59,453 --> 01:44:02,258
I lack.
But it did not take long.

1216
01:44:03,051 --> 01:44:05,301
"Not yet." "I lack."

1217
01:44:06,366 --> 01:44:08,973
The time at
darkroom is extracurricular.

1218
01:44:08,998 --> 01:44:12,322
Indeed, nowadays
not even need to be here.

1219
01:44:12,347 --> 01:44:15,010
And certainly not if it
you have not completed your tasks.

1220
01:44:16,575 --> 01:44:19,683
I'm sorry.
#I worry, Mason.

1221
01:44:20,282 --> 01:44:24,744
- Why?
- I'll tell you.
#The images deliveries ...

1222
01:44:25,728 --> 01:44:29,554
Cool. You are viewing
things uniquely.

1223
01:44:29,579 --> 01:44:33,219
You have so much natural talent.
#Thank you.

1224
01:44:33,244 --> 01:44:38,035
Yes, but that does not even get
a latte in this world.

1225
01:44:39,176 --> 01:44:41,885
I have met many
talented people over the years.

1226
01:44:44,166 --> 01:44:47,064
How many have succeeded
as professionals ...

1227
01:44:47,089 --> 01:44:51,832
without discipline, commitment,
and a lot of work?

1228
01:44:52,911 --> 01:44:55,631
I tell you!
The I can count on two fingers.

1229
01:44:57,255 --> 01:45:02,162
Zero!
#It will not happen, Mason.  The world is too competitive.

1230
01:45:02,187 --> 01:45:05,695
Too many talented people
who are willing to work hard,

1231
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:07,845
and there are many fools who do not have ...

1232
01:45:07,870 --> 01:45:10,571
talent, but
they are ready to improve yourself.

1233
01:45:10,596 --> 01:45:15,318
Many
are sitting in class now.
#You know what they do?

1234
01:45:15,343 --> 01:45:18,450
Tasks, which is what
you should be doing,

1235
01:45:18,475 --> 01:45:23,273
but you're not.
You are here. Why?
#Are you special, Mason?

1236
01:45:24,048 --> 01:45:29,385
No. But in regards to the ethics
work, I think I work hard.

1237
01:45:30,956 --> 01:45:33,912
Many times I spend
entire weekend taking photos.

1238
01:45:36,279 --> 01:45:38,327
Like football, Mason?

1239
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:42,036
- Not much.
- I knew that.

1240
01:45:42,061 --> 01:45:45,794
So I just ordered that
you cover the college game today.

1241
01:45:47,254 --> 01:45:50,572
It starts at 7 and 30 Arrive early.
I want a full card of photos,

1242
01:45:50,597 --> 01:45:52,399
300 images. I want them lowered,

1243
01:45:52,424 --> 01:45:55,367
I want them organized
and I want to see early Monday.

1244
01:45:57,255 --> 01:45:58,797
Want to know why?

1245
01:46:01,096 --> 01:46:04,631
What do you want to be, Mason?
#What do you do?

1246
01:46:04,856 --> 01:46:06,202
I want to take pictures.

1247
01:46:07,291 --> 01:46:11,074
Making art.
#Any moron  You can take pictures, Mason.

1248
01:46:11,299 --> 01:46:13,969
Art is something else.

1249
01:46:13,994 --> 01:46:16,643
What can you contribute
no one else can?

1250
01:46:19,195 --> 01:46:22,295
It's what I'm trying to figure out.
#Try harder.

1251
01:46:22,974 --> 01:46:26,374
Maybe in 20 years
Mr. Turlington call the old ...

1252
01:46:26,399 --> 01:46:28,743
and you tell him "thank you, sir" ...

1253
01:46:28,768 --> 01:46:31,828
for that big talk in the dark room.

1254
01:46:34,053 --> 01:46:36,066
Go back to class and get to work.

1255
01:46:48,999 --> 01:46:51,281
You walk a little weird.

1256
01:46:52,432 --> 01:46:56,721
Fuck you.
#I say. They were in a long time.

1257
01:46:58,839 --> 01:47:00,679
Hope you have paid dinner.

1258
01:47:16,219 --> 01:47:18,527
Mason! To eat, honey!

1259
01:47:20,616 --> 01:47:24,391
Samantha! Still not uploaded
photos with descriptions?

1260
01:47:24,416 --> 01:47:28,712
Come on. The auction ends on Sunday.
#You have to publish.

1261
01:47:29,299 --> 01:47:32,813
What do we do?
#It looks like a junk shop.

1262
01:47:33,012 --> 01:47:37,014
- I thought you had a good job.
- What I have.
#But the house has many expenses.

1263
01:47:37,039 --> 01:47:40,449
Everyone has to contribute.
Your brother took the pictures ...

1264
01:47:40,474 --> 01:47:43,428
You have to collaborate.
#Who buys this shit?

1265
01:47:43,453 --> 01:47:47,492
Sam, careful what you say.
Do not disrespect your mother.

1266
01:47:47,517 --> 01:47:49,604
Want to
roof over your head, right?

1267
01:47:49,629 --> 01:47:52,813
And electricity to charge your cell phone?

1268
01:47:53,847 --> 01:47:58,532
Next year I will not be.
I should have fun in the last year.

1269
01:48:18,785 --> 01:48:19,993
That beautiful nails.

1270
01:48:21,385 --> 01:48:23,346
The painted girl in school.

1271
01:48:24,858 --> 01:48:28,823
- Will you let it?
- Thru the enamel, I think.

1272
01:48:31,947 --> 01:48:35,408
Last summer
the earings now nails ...

1273
01:48:35,433 --> 01:48:38,165
Do not have a portfolio combining?

1274
01:48:38,891 --> 01:48:41,595
Many do it to look "cool".

1275
01:48:45,241 --> 01:48:48,449
When I was in
high ... and working,

1276
01:48:49,353 --> 01:48:53,266
be responsible,
to buy a car,
was "cool".

1277
01:48:54,060 --> 01:48:57,196
Mason, please go get the water.

1278
01:49:30,446 --> 01:49:34,266
Hey. Enough said Turlington
Art and take pictures of the game.

1279
01:49:34,391 --> 01:49:37,175
So point your lens there.

1280
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:39,585
- God.
- And we're off.

1281
01:49:39,610 --> 01:49:44,283
They sent us tickets to the party.
We're coming after the game.

1282
01:50:19,590 --> 01:50:22,227
First! What's up? What's up?

1283
01:50:40,803 --> 01:50:43,067
- Hello, Mason.
- How you doing?

1284
01:50:43,092 --> 01:50:46,044
All right. How long have you been here long?

1285
01:50:47,045 --> 01:50:49,598
- I dunno. A while.
- A while?

1286
01:50:53,514 --> 01:50:55,750
I feel like there's so much ...

1287
01:50:55,775 --> 01:50:59,359
I could be doing and
I want to be doing but do not.

1288
01:50:59,384 --> 01:51:00,903
Why not?

1289
01:51:02,055 --> 01:51:05,878
I think it is fear ...
what people will think.

1290
01:51:05,903 --> 01:51:08,135
- You know, trials.
- Yes.

1291
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:11,680
It's easy to say, "No I
care what other people think "

1292
01:51:11,705 --> 01:51:14,984
- But everyone cares.
- That's right.
#In the background.

1293
01:51:15,800 --> 01:51:19,362
I get angry with many people
with whom I am in touch ...

1294
01:51:19,387 --> 01:51:22,286
because I control
or whatever, but ...

1295
01:51:22,520 --> 01:51:24,755
they do not even realize they do.

1296
01:51:28,584 --> 01:51:32,416
And in this world
where no one plays perfect ...

1297
01:51:32,441 --> 01:51:35,124
What is different? What changes?

1298
01:51:36,115 --> 01:51:39,819
Everything. I just want
do whatever you want.

1299
01:51:39,844 --> 01:51:41,948
That makes me feel alive.

1300
01:51:41,973 --> 01:51:45,341
Instead of giving me
the appearance of normality.

1301
01:51:46,466 --> 01:51:47,853
Whatever it is.

1302
01:51:49,008 --> 01:51:50,572
I do not think much.

1303
01:51:53,370 --> 01:51:55,419
You're a little weird, you know?

1304
01:51:58,983 --> 01:52:03,349
Is it a compliment?
#I dunno. Want to be weird?

1305
01:52:04,458 --> 01:52:07,972
I do not want to scare ...
children in the park or something.

1306
01:52:10,357 --> 01:52:12,076
I like talking to you.

1307
01:52:12,101 --> 01:52:16,820
I do not usually try to vocalize
my thoughts, feelings, or anything.

1308
01:52:18,019 --> 01:52:21,186
Never sounds good.
Words are ... stupid.

1309
01:52:22,812 --> 01:52:24,436
And why you try me?

1310
01:52:25,473 --> 01:52:27,752
I dunno. I think because I feel comfortable.

1311
01:52:29,167 --> 01:52:30,239
I'm glad.

1312
01:52:35,013 --> 01:52:37,855
Hi, Jim. Sorry I'm late.

1313
01:52:38,677 --> 01:52:40,504
What time you had to get there?

1314
01:52:41,877 --> 01:52:43,686
I dunno. A while ago.

1315
01:52:45,048 --> 01:52:49,189
A guy while ...
Thirty minutes? An hour?

1316
01:52:50,201 --> 01:52:55,198
No one knew where you were
until your sister said.
#She arrived earlier.

1317
01:52:56,722 --> 01:53:00,718
I'm sorry.
#I hear that a lot lately.

1318
01:53:03,092 --> 01:53:05,710
But ... you do not really care.

1319
01:53:05,735 --> 01:53:09,327
You come and go at your leisure.

1320
01:53:09,752 --> 01:53:12,359
You do not care if your
mother is concerned,

1321
01:53:13,233 --> 01:53:15,713
or what time you should arrive.
Is that the story?

1322
01:53:17,324 --> 01:53:21,996
- I do not know what to say.
- Stop babbling!
#Speak up!

1323
01:53:22,521 --> 01:53:26,679
Do not understand a
word. Sounds like "mhmmm" ...

1324
01:53:26,886 --> 01:53:28,786
And I'm asking questions and you just ...

1325
01:53:28,811 --> 01:53:31,774
Can it be a day without
everyone is fucking with me?

1326
01:53:34,595 --> 01:53:35,900
Would I fuck?

1327
01:53:38,041 --> 01:53:39,587
It's my home.

1328
01:53:39,612 --> 01:53:44,075
If you want to live in my house, comes
when you said you'd be.

1329
01:53:46,060 --> 01:53:50,565
I know I'm not your dad.
You know how I know?
#Because I'm here.

1330
01:53:50,590 --> 01:53:55,691
I'm the one who has a job, pays
bills, take care of you, your mom ...

1331
01:53:55,716 --> 01:53:59,577
your sister ... Huh? Eh?
#That's me!

1332
01:54:11,122 --> 01:54:12,436
CORRECTIONS

1333
01:54:22,894 --> 01:54:24,624
- Good day.
- Good day.

1334
01:54:25,874 --> 01:54:29,326
Who of you
used the downstairs bathroom last night?

1335
01:54:30,637 --> 01:54:34,382
I dunno. It was not me.
#The high, what's his name?

1336
01:54:39,696 --> 01:54:43,728
Phillip read?
#Sign that says:  "Do not use this bathroom is broken."

1337
01:54:43,753 --> 01:54:48,267
Is it so difficult?
#I dunno. I'm sorry.

1338
01:54:56,953 --> 01:54:59,718
Why?
#It's very big for us.

1339
01:54:59,743 --> 01:55:03,248
Soon you're going to college.
It is very expensive. Basta.

1340
01:55:04,036 --> 01:55:06,168
What you bought?

1341
01:55:07,263 --> 01:55:10,410
Because I love taking
bad decisions in my life.

1342
01:55:10,435 --> 01:55:12,429
And have you on the edge of poverty.

1343
01:55:14,257 --> 01:55:17,516
I spent half
of my life buying crap ...

1344
01:55:17,541 --> 01:55:20,636
and now I will go the other
quitndomelas half off.

1345
01:55:20,961 --> 01:55:23,193
Yeah? Like what?

1346
01:55:23,991 --> 01:55:28,560
I shook off two spouses.
#Now it's up to the  mortgage, maintenance,

1347
01:55:28,585 --> 01:55:33,847
Trinkets, insurance ...
owners, property taxes,

1348
01:55:33,872 --> 01:55:34,931
pipes ..

1349
01:55:37,587 --> 01:55:40,595
Do you know? Now
Mommy will be more monk.

1350
01:55:41,690 --> 01:55:45,589
Simple. Celibate.
#That sucks, Mom.

1351
01:55:48,019 --> 01:55:51,869
Good. Then I will be a
poor bitch with a big house.

1352
01:55:53,245 --> 01:55:54,253
Does it sound better?

1353
01:56:01,232 --> 01:56:04,927
Mason, please
do not leave me the dirty plate.

1354
01:56:06,620 --> 01:56:07,984
I wash dishes all day.

1355
01:56:08,009 --> 01:56:13,311
All right! You're a professional. You can
wash one or two others for your poor mother.

1356
01:56:13,837 --> 01:56:16,317
- OK.
- Thank you.

1357
01:56:39,664 --> 01:56:40,649
Want one?

1358
01:56:42,618 --> 01:56:45,614
Nor touched. I watched all the time.

1359
01:56:45,639 --> 01:56:47,975
To who do you observe degenerate.

1360
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:52,232
It's like dating.

1361
01:56:53,676 --> 01:56:54,790
Health!

1362
01:56:56,005 --> 01:56:57,387
A romantic evening.

1363
01:56:58,493 --> 01:57:00,271
But I will not kiss.

1364
01:57:02,353 --> 01:57:03,712
Although I suck you.

1365
01:57:12,516 --> 01:57:16,707
Mason! There is emergency in the lounge.
#I do it as quickly as possible.

1366
01:57:16,732 --> 01:57:20,359
I must have confused then.
Because recently I saw chatting with April.

1367
01:57:20,384 --> 01:57:25,010
We must renew salads.
#6 A table, two tables  4 I can not use,

1368
01:57:25,035 --> 01:57:28,648
because they are dirty.
#Enrique did not come. I do what I can.

1369
01:57:29,290 --> 01:57:33,492
Well, we're in trouble.
#What do you tell clients?

1370
01:57:33,517 --> 01:57:38,016
"Sorry about the dirty dishes,
but Mason does what he can. "

1371
01:57:38,340 --> 01:57:40,126
"That's what he told me."

1372
01:57:40,151 --> 01:57:43,292
"After flirting with April
and eat shrimp that had been ".

1373
01:57:43,974 --> 01:57:48,645
I know that today is difficult.
But I want to tell you something.

1374
01:57:49,481 --> 01:57:53,654
I have scheduled you
Waiters this summer.
#It's a lot more responsibility.

1375
01:57:53,679 --> 01:57:55,166
And more money.

1376
01:57:56,170 --> 01:57:58,916
What do you think?
#All right.

1377
01:57:59,995 --> 01:58:03,380
I know you can with the money, but
you can handle the responsibility?

1378
01:58:04,466 --> 01:58:08,548
I think so. Because I believe in you.
#I need you in the lounge.

1379
01:58:08,573 --> 01:58:10,173
Leave the dishes and hurry.

1380
01:58:11,341 --> 01:58:12,903
Come on. Do not disappoint me!

1381
01:58:17,701 --> 01:58:21,100
Does it work well?
Is the alternator does not give more trouble?

1382
01:58:21,468 --> 01:58:23,813
All right. Ready for the trip.

1383
01:58:26,031 --> 01:58:28,579
Are you going to see your sister in Austin?

1384
01:58:28,604 --> 01:58:31,237
Yeah, he said I could stay
in his uni dorm.

1385
01:58:31,262 --> 01:58:34,323
I think your partner is
travel, so no problem.

1386
01:58:34,585 --> 01:58:37,825
Already you applied for UT?
Would you have sent the form?

1387
01:58:37,850 --> 01:58:42,505
Not yet, but Sheena
is practically accepted.
#If that's where you want to go ...

1388
01:58:42,530 --> 01:58:44,841
You should postularte
for early acceptance.

1389
01:58:44,866 --> 01:58:48,110
Let them know you're
a man who knows what he wants.

1390
01:58:48,535 --> 01:58:53,176
Some firmness
achieved much in this life.
- No?  - Yes.

1391
01:58:53,701 --> 01:58:55,972
And work? How's it going?

1392
01:58:57,076 --> 01:59:00,482
All right. Today was
a bad day. He missed a guy.

1393
01:59:00,807 --> 01:59:04,278
But no doubt it gives
another perspective on life.

1394
01:59:04,803 --> 01:59:06,391
People are pig!

1395
01:59:07,871 --> 01:59:11,842
When they ask you,
say "A Mason is doing very well."

1396
01:59:11,867 --> 01:59:14,834
"You have a job. Cleans everything."

1397
01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:18,513
Say hello to Annie and Cooper.

1398
01:59:18,538 --> 01:59:21,802
Say hello to your big brother.
"Hello, brother."

1399
01:59:21,827 --> 01:59:24,672
Hi Annie. Hello, friend.
#Say goodbye.

1400
01:59:27,166 --> 01:59:28,238
See you.

1401
01:59:29,542 --> 01:59:34,263
Be careful when driving.
#Do not send text messages or anything.

1402
01:59:35,592 --> 01:59:40,025
You Obi Wan.
Focused and patient ... is not it?

1403
01:59:40,050 --> 01:59:44,652
Three cars Watch
in front and two behind.
#It takes two bad  leads to an accident.

1404
01:59:45,957 --> 01:59:49,765
Tell your sister that
grab your phone and call me.

1405
01:59:50,406 --> 01:59:53,319
- Well, my friend. Have a good time.
- Goodbye, Dad.

1406
01:59:56,096 --> 01:59:59,120
Take this to your sister.
Put it on the truck.

1407
02:00:01,971 --> 02:00:04,863
- And where Sheena sleep?
- With her friend Emily.

1408
02:00:05,565 --> 02:00:07,786
- Does Emily?
- Yes!

1409
02:00:08,169 --> 02:00:10,661
It is in the third year.
He has his own apartment.

1410
02:00:13,826 --> 02:00:17,425
This is for emergencies.
Do not spend it, I want it back.

1411
02:00:18,150 --> 02:00:19,154
Thank you.

1412
02:00:20,581 --> 02:00:24,594
Did you do your homework?
#Almost everything, but I'll finish tomorrow.

1413
02:00:24,919 --> 02:00:28,231
The junior year is very
important for uni. Do not blow it.

1414
02:00:28,256 --> 02:00:31,214
I know, I know.
That's what we're going to UT.

1415
02:00:31,474 --> 02:00:35,787
Do not you want to go? "Sheena, what
a trip with Mom "? Promissory gasoline.

1416
02:00:38,060 --> 02:00:39,820
I'm kidding. I have work.

1417
02:00:42,283 --> 02:00:44,412
- Call me when you get there.
- I will do it.

1418
02:00:46,881 --> 02:00:47,932
Have fun!

1419
02:00:57,621 --> 02:01:01,169
Sounds to me like a vision
all very simplistic.

1420
02:01:01,508 --> 02:01:04,074
Not at all. Finally I got it.

1421
02:01:04,099 --> 02:01:06,922
When they realized
it would be too expensive ...

1422
02:01:06,947 --> 02:01:10,575
build cyborgs and robots,

1423
02:01:11,384 --> 02:01:14,754
or whether the costs were
soaring, they decided that humans ...

1424
02:01:14,779 --> 02:01:19,588
self transformed into robots.
- That's what's happening.  - Right now?

1425
02:01:20,091 --> 02:01:25,156
Why not? There are billions of
ours out there, doing nothing.

1426
02:01:26,564 --> 02:01:30,365
We have cost.
And until we self-maintenance,

1427
02:01:30,889 --> 02:01:32,747
and we reproduce constantly.

1428
02:01:33,747 --> 02:01:35,895
And as we can see, we're ...

1429
02:01:36,219 --> 02:01:41,138
biologically programmed
to become cyborgs.
- As?  - Seriously.

1430
02:01:41,163 --> 02:01:44,056
I read an article the other day saying ...

1431
02:01:44,381 --> 02:01:46,951
when we heard the sound
the inbox

1432
02:01:46,976 --> 02:01:49,831
received an injection
dopamine in our brains.

1433
02:01:50,056 --> 02:01:54,258
As if we rewarded chemically
for letting it get brainwashed.

1434
02:01:54,971 --> 02:01:57,974
Is it not evil? We're screwed!

1435
02:01:58,139 --> 02:02:01,004
You think to delete your
Facebook page will change anything?

1436
02:02:01,039 --> 02:02:06,900
I remember when it did Traver
last year. And everyone laughed at him.

1437
02:02:07,216 --> 02:02:10,977
You laughed more than anyone.
#I keep laughing at Traver.

1438
02:02:12,962 --> 02:02:17,705
Your need for attention was pathetic.
#Or to be different, or something.

1439
02:02:17,730 --> 02:02:21,337
And it ended with that silly story
about it in the school newspaper.

1440
02:02:21,354 --> 02:02:24,603
And I had to make a great
ad when he returned the following month.

1441
02:02:24,753 --> 02:02:27,078
But I do not care.

1442
02:02:27,103 --> 02:02:30,462
I want to try to live
my life without a screen.

1443
02:02:30,786 --> 02:02:33,555
I want a real interaction.

1444
02:02:34,210 --> 02:02:38,065
A real person.
No profile posted online.

1445
02:02:38,278 --> 02:02:42,640
Apology. What were you saying?
#It's okay.  I know you're joking, but ...

1446
02:02:42,665 --> 02:02:47,159
there is some truth. You
state with your phone the entire trip.

1447
02:02:47,184 --> 02:02:48,644
What do you do actually?

1448
02:02:48,669 --> 02:02:51,718
If you do not care what they do
friends on Saturday afternoon,

1449
02:02:51,743 --> 02:02:57,534
you're not immersed
my deep grievances,

1450
02:02:57,559 --> 02:03:01,577
and it seems that all
They are in a place in between.

1451
02:03:01,955 --> 02:03:04,099
Without experiencing anything seriously.

1452
02:03:04,124 --> 02:03:06,451
It is not an experience.
It's just information.

1453
02:03:07,639 --> 02:03:12,173
Mira. For example:
I got the address  club where we meet.

1454
02:03:12,198 --> 02:03:15,463
Therefore we do not lose
the streets of Austin later.

1455
02:03:15,488 --> 02:03:19,642
Thank you very much, Facebook.
#And I sent a text to my mom.

1456
02:03:20,167 --> 02:03:24,577
Revolutionary!
#You have not seen you for 55 minutes.

1457
02:03:27,686 --> 02:03:32,206
God! The most important ...
#I was told that  we have a miniature pig.

1458
02:03:36,716 --> 02:03:40,509
You're right. This is ...
It is a very cute pig.

1459
02:03:41,272 --> 02:03:44,823
Our lives can continue.
#I want one.

1460
02:03:50,277 --> 02:03:51,326
Nice shot.

1461
02:03:52,543 --> 02:03:56,580
Show him one
identification and will pass.

1462
02:03:57,661 --> 02:03:58,996
Room 206, right?

1463
02:04:00,526 --> 02:04:05,144
- But do not spend the night there.
- All right. Have fun.
#Thank you.

1464
02:04:05,902 --> 02:04:09,709
How long you go out together?
#About three months.

1465
02:04:10,713 --> 02:04:14,354
We met at a party and all good.

1466
02:04:14,679 --> 02:04:19,643
- It seems quiet.
- Yes, it is.
- It also goes to the University of Texas?  - Yes.

1467
02:04:19,668 --> 02:04:20,802
What are you studying?

1468
02:04:20,827 --> 02:04:25,843
History and Italian ...
as a secondary subject.

1469
02:04:25,868 --> 02:04:28,111
Want to teach?

1470
02:04:28,136 --> 02:04:31,109
I dunno. I think he is still thinking.

1471
02:04:31,734 --> 02:04:34,231
He already decided. He's smart.

1472
02:04:34,256 --> 02:04:37,046
And where you live when you come here?

1473
02:04:37,071 --> 02:04:41,905
I'm not sure.
We will look at some apartments ...
#morning.

1474
02:04:43,097 --> 02:04:46,233
My parents assume that
I live in a college dorm.

1475
02:04:46,529 --> 02:04:51,291
But I will pay the uni, so ...
#not so important.

1476
02:04:51,316 --> 02:04:54,013
You do not have to listen to what
tell your parents after 18.

1477
02:04:54,038 --> 02:04:58,963
Especially if you do not help financially.
#That's what I thought.

1478
02:04:59,561 --> 02:05:03,833
The bedrooms are not bad.
Especially if they are mixed.

1479
02:05:04,508 --> 02:05:08,708
I had never been
surrounded by so many handsome guys.

1480
02:05:09,893 --> 02:05:11,252
The uni is fun!

1481
02:05:13,203 --> 02:05:15,224
- I'm excited.
- It's good, yes.

1482
02:05:36,708 --> 02:05:40,712
<I> The day I was born I started to age </ i>

1483
02:05:40,737 --> 02:05:44,770
<I> nobody told me that life
I could be so lonely and cruel </ i>

1484
02:05:44,795 --> 02:05:48,201
<I> He had gray hair at 23 </ i>

1485
02:05:48,226 --> 02:05:52,024
<I> this life
bad luck will end with me </ i>

1486
02:05:52,049 --> 02:05:57,616
<I> The old black crow
grooves has left me in the face </ i>

1487
02:05:59,919 --> 02:06:05,320
<I> and on the go
I'm in the same place </ i>

1488
02:06:05,345 --> 02:06:08,337
<I> The hard life will end with me </ i>

1489
02:06:28,024 --> 02:06:33,230
The latest death during construction
Hoover dam was his son,

1490
02:06:33,455 --> 02:06:39,437
Patrick Tierney,
who died on December 20, 1935.

1491
02:06:39,462 --> 02:06:42,208
Just thirteen years later.

1492
02:06:42,733 --> 02:06:44,894
Do you see the girls in the sisterhood?

1493
02:06:48,382 --> 02:06:52,246
I already decided. If you delete your
Facebook page, I will launch me.

1494
02:06:53,702 --> 02:06:58,083
Yes, in a few years
that will be you ... and that will be me.

1495
02:07:01,310 --> 02:07:06,861
A star map. A map
of heavenly bodies as accurate ...

1496
02:07:06,886 --> 02:07:12,357
that could plot the position of the
North Star 14,000 years later ...

1497
02:07:12,382 --> 02:07:14,082
and future generations ...

1498
02:07:14,178 --> 02:07:17,409
I wonder what it does.
Do not come to eat.

1499
02:07:18,119 --> 02:07:21,911
It is. He is a professor at UT.
And with the post insured.

1500
02:07:23,894 --> 02:07:28,254
Look at all these people.
Why are you here at three in the morning?

1501
02:07:28,279 --> 02:07:32,703
What we do
at three in the morning?
#You know why we're here?

1502
02:07:32,728 --> 02:07:34,882
The cheese! We have a purpose.

1503
02:07:36,107 --> 02:07:37,529
Right.

1504
02:07:39,851 --> 02:07:43,059
In the next summer,
so will our lives.

1505
02:07:45,349 --> 02:07:47,981
Staying up all night. View shows.

1506
02:07:49,284 --> 02:07:50,284
What we want.

1507
02:07:54,112 --> 02:07:56,491
- Every so.
- Sounds good.

1508
02:07:57,507 --> 02:08:00,124
- Until inspiration strikes.
- Only at the time.

1509
02:08:02,237 --> 02:08:04,558
- Anything else?
- More cheese?

1510
02:08:12,374 --> 02:08:16,003
- God ...
- What?

1511
02:08:16,028 --> 02:08:19,447
Is not it a bit overwhelming?

1512
02:08:19,986 --> 02:08:21,122
The university ...

1513
02:08:22,202 --> 02:08:24,923
I like the idea
living away from home, and ...

1514
02:08:24,948 --> 02:08:28,072
acquire knowledge
and improve my photos, but it is ...

1515
02:08:28,920 --> 02:08:33,288
I do not think it is
transformative.

1516
02:08:33,313 --> 02:08:37,167
Do not think it's as transformative.
It's just the next step.

1517
02:08:37,192 --> 02:08:41,974
It's like a preset space
you already have your name and number.

1518
02:08:42,916 --> 02:08:47,042
Not think that's the key to my future.
#Look at my mom.

1519
02:08:47,067 --> 02:08:49,723
He graduated and got a job.

1520
02:08:50,348 --> 02:08:53,324
- Pays the bills ...
- I like your mom.

1521
02:08:54,229 --> 02:08:56,455
Me too, but I mean ...

1522
02:08:57,127 --> 02:09:00,256
In the background,
she is as confused as me.

1523
02:09:01,390 --> 02:09:02,447
Thank you.

1524
02:10:14,776 --> 02:10:18,039
Hello?
#Hi! Oh ...

1525
02:10:18,064 --> 02:10:21,359
Not Sam told you
we ... we'd be here?

1526
02:10:22,784 --> 02:10:26,095
No.
#Sorry, uh ...

1527
02:10:27,051 --> 02:10:30,171
We said you'd be ...
out the weekend.

1528
02:10:30,196 --> 02:10:32,582
I was. And I just got back.

1529
02:10:33,348 --> 02:10:38,166
Are you her ... brother?
#Yes, I am ... I'm a Mason.

1530
02:10:39,018 --> 02:10:40,107
She is Sheena.

1531
02:10:43,643 --> 02:10:44,493
What good.

1532
02:10:45,597 --> 02:10:50,004
All right. I will leave my
things and I'm going to eat something ...

1533
02:10:50,029 --> 02:10:55,405
- And I'll be back in a while.
- We have to go soon ...

1534
02:10:55,430 --> 02:10:56,630
so ...

1535
02:10:57,629 --> 02:11:01,536
- All right. Nice to meet you.
- Same here.
#Sorry!

1536
02:11:08,870 --> 02:11:10,648
It was so uncomfortable!

1537
02:11:34,054 --> 02:11:36,797
Mason! Winner of the silver medal.

1538
02:11:37,758 --> 02:11:40,142
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

1539
02:11:40,167 --> 02:11:43,874
- I found out about the scholarship.
- Yes all helps..

1540
02:11:43,899 --> 02:11:47,360
When you go to there?
#In the summer, I think.

1541
02:11:47,385 --> 02:11:51,706
And I will work a little earlier.
I want to save some money.

1542
02:11:51,731 --> 02:11:55,872
Before you have to make do.
#That's the idea.

1543
02:11:56,430 --> 02:11:57,893
How do you feel?

1544
02:11:58,218 --> 02:12:01,956
Excited.
Half excited, half terrified.

1545
02:12:01,981 --> 02:12:05,107
- This voluptuous panic.
- That's right.

1546
02:12:05,429 --> 02:12:08,125
It will be good. It will be great for you.

1547
02:12:10,573 --> 02:12:14,209
Find your own
people in the uni, you know?
#That's right.

1548
02:12:14,690 --> 02:12:17,993
You'll be fine. Have a good
heart. Listen to your heart.

1549
02:12:18,418 --> 02:12:21,412
- Thank you.
- Good luck. Do not forget to floss.

1550
02:12:32,137 --> 02:12:34,655
- YOU SEE THE THREE. WHAT?
- I CAN NOT, SEE YOU TOMORROW.

1551
02:12:34,680 --> 02:12:36,915
I do not understand why
you act like a child.

1552
02:12:36,940 --> 02:12:41,131
Not so. Thou became a
something big to tell everyone.

1553
02:12:41,156 --> 02:12:42,417
I did not tell anyone.

1554
02:12:42,442 --> 02:12:45,498
And how do you know Cynthy
you go to the party with a loser,

1555
02:12:45,523 --> 02:12:47,410
despite not seeing him?

1556
02:12:47,435 --> 02:12:51,381
- He's my best friend.
- Your best friend has a big mouth.

1557
02:12:51,406 --> 02:12:55,271
Talk it over with her, then.
#Why did not you tell  it was Robert Tosh?

1558
02:12:55,296 --> 02:12:58,592
You can keep talking,
while including truth

1559
02:12:58,617 --> 02:13:00,903
which is not
would have this conversation ...

1560
02:13:00,938 --> 02:13:03,831
if your boyfriend was not uni
outside this weekend.

1561
02:13:05,114 --> 02:13:06,797
You had already bought the tickets.

1562
02:13:07,324 --> 02:13:10,659
Does not matter.
I just wanted to be friendly.

1563
02:13:10,684 --> 02:13:14,067
It is a humiliation. I can not do it.

1564
02:13:14,752 --> 02:13:17,310
Mr. "I do not care
what anyone thinks of me. "

1565
02:13:17,335 --> 02:13:21,839
Fuck that. I care what
I think for me, it's no big deal.

1566
02:13:23,337 --> 02:13:25,168
The King of the Pity Party.

1567
02:13:26,680 --> 02:13:29,493
Okay, we will not.
#Fantastic.

1568
02:13:40,505 --> 02:13:41,718
What we are ...

1569
02:13:45,380 --> 02:13:48,878
We knew this was coming.
I'm the one who did something about it.

1570
02:13:48,903 --> 02:13:51,589
- Yes, you fucked a guy from uni.
- Fuck you!

1571
02:13:53,493 --> 02:13:55,821
- I do not regret anything.
- Of course not.

1572
02:13:56,360 --> 02:14:01,129
It's a relief to be with someone
who is not depressed all the time.

1573
02:14:02,185 --> 02:14:05,865
The world is not so horrible.
Not everything is a big conspiracy.

1574
02:14:05,989 --> 02:14:07,836
I'm glad you could think so.

1575
02:14:08,161 --> 02:14:12,857
Sure dating an athlete
helps you ... clear your mind.

1576
02:14:13,658 --> 02:14:16,865
It's not an athlete.
It is only on the lacrosse team.

1577
02:14:17,347 --> 02:14:19,750
We will be in universities
different next year.

1578
02:14:19,775 --> 02:14:24,339
It is not such a serious relationship.
#Great! Now I feel much better.

1579
02:14:25,523 --> 02:14:30,144
- I want to have fun.
- A well he passes.
#Madura, Mason.

1580
02:14:32,494 --> 02:14:34,691
I have not been alone.

1581
02:14:36,066 --> 02:14:39,140
Who?
#What do you care?

1582
02:14:40,153 --> 02:14:42,826
- Who?
- Who cares?

1583
02:14:44,081 --> 02:14:45,680
You brought it up.

1584
02:14:51,979 --> 02:14:56,588
It makes no sense.
#Now you're playing the fool.

1585
02:15:01,477 --> 02:15:04,369
Fuck! I would rather
to cut my balls ...

1586
02:15:04,394 --> 02:15:06,706
rather than having to
endure something like that again.

1587
02:15:07,846 --> 02:15:12,022
- Well, not never touch us.
- Thank God.

1588
02:15:12,747 --> 02:15:15,580
- Give me.
- All for you. Drink it all.

1589
02:15:18,828 --> 02:15:22,021
Do you go out with me tonight?
There are very interesting things there.

1590
02:15:22,046 --> 02:15:27,008
I'm going to see a show
with my father in Austin.
#Some friends playing.

1591
02:15:27,933 --> 02:15:29,593
Well, have fun.

1592
02:15:32,172 --> 02:15:35,460
Fuck! There are both cars.
#I do not want to enter.

1593
02:15:36,527 --> 02:15:40,384
Man, you both have fun.
Your family loves you.

1594
02:15:40,409 --> 02:15:42,226
That passes very well.

1595
02:15:43,674 --> 02:15:47,043
- You're coming with me.
- No, no, hell, no. - Yes!

1596
02:15:47,068 --> 02:15:49,435
My mom loves you. You have to say hello.

1597
02:15:51,133 --> 02:15:52,805
Want offend?

1598
02:15:54,065 --> 02:15:58,660
Well come on!
#One second. Just a second, really.

1599
02:15:59,785 --> 02:16:04,011
- You're in enemy territory.
- We already know.

1600
02:16:14,832 --> 02:16:16,039
Look who's here!

1601
02:16:35,828 --> 02:16:37,849
Wait, wait. We will take photos.

1602
02:16:39,266 --> 02:16:43,835
Got a camera?
#Congratulations, baby.  I do not know you, but I congratulate you.

1603
02:16:44,421 --> 02:16:49,139
Very well. Look here.
- Smile!  - Ready!

1604
02:16:49,464 --> 02:16:50,500
That was good.

1605
02:16:54,489 --> 02:16:56,889
Sam, where are you? Samantha!

1606
02:16:57,613 --> 02:17:00,692
And Mason father?
I am generous, come here.

1607
02:17:05,207 --> 02:17:08,585
Beautiful!
#They'll send the email.

1608
02:17:09,889 --> 02:17:12,033
Do not start. Do not start.

1609
02:17:21,481 --> 02:17:24,487
It seems incredible that have been
so far. I was grateful.

1610
02:17:25,202 --> 02:17:29,778
We would not have missed for anything
world. I'm proud of you.

1611
02:17:30,547 --> 02:17:32,833
Congratulations!

1612
02:17:32,858 --> 02:17:36,097
I regret that Lee could not come.
It's graduation trip.

1613
02:17:36,228 --> 02:17:40,388
- Send greetings.
- I will do it.
#Abby, I did not recognize.  How old are you now?

1614
02:17:40,414 --> 02:17:42,577
- Thirteen.
- Unbelievable.

1615
02:17:46,354 --> 02:17:48,313
A fill!

1616
02:17:49,657 --> 02:17:53,103
- Will you?
- Yes, of course.

1617
02:17:53,728 --> 02:17:54,911
I brought you something.

1618
02:17:56,723 --> 02:18:00,429
What is it?
#It is a savings bond. It has its value.

1619
02:18:00,454 --> 02:18:02,744
It is better than money,
did you spend it.

1620
02:18:04,192 --> 02:18:07,972
- Go, is that your mom?
- Yes, she is.

1621
02:18:09,196 --> 02:18:11,364
Rule three seconds.
Put it on the plate.

1622
02:18:15,099 --> 02:18:17,019
I want to make a toast to Mason!

1623
02:18:19,746 --> 02:18:24,182
Mason, I know not
wanted a party tonight, but ...
#we do.

1624
02:18:25,387 --> 02:18:27,997
Just finish
secondary once in life!

1625
02:18:28,630 --> 02:18:31,735
And I want festejarte,
and celebrate the next stage ...

1626
02:18:31,972 --> 02:18:35,379
You will learn both the
university. You'll laugh so much.

1627
02:18:35,404 --> 02:18:39,599
Have teachers who inspire you.
#You will learn more of your art.

1628
02:18:40,124 --> 02:18:42,458
I love you. I'm proud of you.

1629
02:18:42,483 --> 02:18:45,297
- By Mason.
- By Mason!

1630
02:18:49,532 --> 02:18:51,093
Touches you, brother.

1631
02:18:56,553 --> 02:19:00,365
Mason, a toast
by ... future. For your future.

1632
02:19:01,006 --> 02:19:04,537
It has been difficult
this ... end of school year.

1633
02:19:04,562 --> 02:19:06,736
Wondering what college you choose.

1634
02:19:06,761 --> 02:19:09,732
Mason said he wanted ...

1635
02:19:09,757 --> 02:19:12,158
be as far from home as possible,

1636
02:19:12,183 --> 02:19:16,734
while maintaining the agreement
to stay in the state.
#What I appreciate that.

1637
02:19:16,759 --> 02:19:21,341
It is a wise man
and will have a great future.
#To your health, friend.

1638
02:19:26,267 --> 02:19:27,803
Son Mason!

1639
02:19:27,828 --> 02:19:31,396
Just graduated, 18 and hetero!

1640
02:19:32,455 --> 02:19:35,474
I ignore it.
#My brother needs  learn to control.

1641
02:19:35,499 --> 02:19:37,970
I do not know you both
as the others here.

1642
02:19:40,290 --> 02:19:42,938
But since you
I met've grown a lot.

1643
02:19:43,663 --> 02:19:48,361
And I'm proud of you.
#If photography is not working,

1644
02:19:48,565 --> 02:19:50,948
always have a job - without the hoop.

1645
02:19:52,187 --> 02:19:55,779
Maybe you can locate
in the receiving part. To your health!

1646
02:19:58,762 --> 02:20:01,996
Sam, a word!
#Come on, Sam.

1647
02:20:02,321 --> 02:20:05,869
Come on, baby!
#Good luck!

1648
02:20:15,297 --> 02:20:19,237
- So you broke up with your girlfriend?
- Yes, recently.

1649
02:20:19,462 --> 02:20:21,429
- What was his name?
- Sheena.

1650
02:20:21,654 --> 02:20:25,467
Sheena. Did you go to college?

1651
02:20:25,492 --> 02:20:29,256
No. No ... stay ...
on this side of Texas.

1652
02:20:29,897 --> 02:20:31,688
Do you need a ride to uni?

1653
02:20:34,339 --> 02:20:39,163
I wanted to say hello
before they left.
#Are known, do not you, Annie?

1654
02:20:39,188 --> 02:20:41,959
- Yes, Sam ... graduation.
- Right.

1655
02:20:41,984 --> 02:20:45,500
And where is the little one?
#He stayed at home.

1656
02:20:46,292 --> 02:20:49,944
He was very upset at Sam.
#I'd love to see it!

1657
02:20:50,655 --> 02:20:54,936
We expect a
special weekend, and ...
#I'm so glad that you met.

1658
02:20:54,961 --> 02:20:58,706
You met him at a good time, I think.
#I think so.

1659
02:20:58,731 --> 02:21:01,475
- Good to see you.
- Me too.

1660
02:21:01,500 --> 02:21:04,423
- I'm proud of your son.
- We all are.

1661
02:21:07,691 --> 02:21:09,404
She's a witch!

1662
02:21:11,798 --> 02:21:14,453
You remember going to the uni, you know?

1663
02:21:14,478 --> 02:21:16,669
And if you look
something to me or your father,

1664
02:21:17,379 --> 02:21:22,063
you go down a few women.
#You will pistoning followed.

1665
02:21:22,088 --> 02:21:23,677
You will exercise followed.

1666
02:21:23,702 --> 02:21:27,508
Think about it. There are many flowers in this bouquet.
#But do me a favor.

1667
02:21:27,533 --> 02:21:29,883
This summer you will
in a vulnerable position.

1668
02:21:29,908 --> 02:21:33,130
Protect yourself during sex separation.

1669
02:21:34,719 --> 02:21:37,062
And he knows what I'm talking about.

1670
02:21:37,638 --> 02:21:41,450
Look what happened to him. Voila!
#Steven ...

1671
02:21:43,131 --> 02:21:44,187
Health.

1672
02:21:46,134 --> 02:21:48,643
- It's not that simple.
- Four more years!

1673
02:21:55,537 --> 02:21:58,641
- Recycle?
- There's a bag there.

1674
02:22:04,491 --> 02:22:08,174
Am I your only ex husband at the party?
#Yes.

1675
02:22:08,399 --> 02:22:10,250
But I am not your only wife here.

1676
02:22:15,930 --> 02:22:18,045
Can you believe that both
finished school?

1677
02:22:19,732 --> 02:22:22,737
No.
#I can not.

1678
02:22:24,842 --> 02:22:28,834
You've done a great job with both.

1679
02:22:28,869 --> 02:22:33,040
Thanks for saying that.
#I never thought I'd hear you say that.

1680
02:22:33,065 --> 02:22:35,315
It's the truth. Thank you.

1681
02:22:37,377 --> 02:22:40,617
- And you do it again.
- I know, I know.

1682
02:22:41,855 --> 02:22:45,880
Missing 15 years
that has the ... empty nest.

1683
02:22:47,284 --> 02:22:52,168
I like to help.
#To help with this.  It is very good that you have done.

1684
02:22:52,193 --> 02:22:54,297
I just wanted to give you a little ... ...

1685
02:22:58,016 --> 02:22:59,494
I have no cash.

1686
02:23:00,498 --> 02:23:02,413
It's in the portfolio of Annie. Be right back.

1687
02:23:10,601 --> 02:23:14,394
Tough. The guy is a player
lacrosse uni. What can you do?

1688
02:23:14,689 --> 02:23:19,564
She neither likes sports.
- A beer?  - No thanks.

1689
02:23:19,589 --> 02:23:21,681
- You can drink a.
- No thanks.

1690
02:23:22,993 --> 02:23:26,617
All has happened to us
the same in one way or another.

1691
02:23:28,544 --> 02:23:31,546
It's not the same.
You never knew well.

1692
02:23:31,571 --> 02:23:36,456
I know it's not the same.
#I do not know what I did wrong.

1693
02:23:36,945 --> 02:23:39,926
Hi, Jimmy! Hello.

1694
02:23:41,103 --> 02:23:44,985
Hello, Mason.
#We are hunting in the  green room, is there problem?

1695
02:23:45,010 --> 02:23:46,330
All ten points.

1696
02:23:54,644 --> 02:23:55,957
Incredible.

1697
02:23:57,180 --> 02:24:01,982
We decided to come early to see you.
#Term and will be with you for a while.

1698
02:24:02,987 --> 02:24:05,270
I guarantee that you did nothing wrong.

1699
02:24:05,572 --> 02:24:08,548
Those Loves
Secondary never work.

1700
02:24:09,428 --> 02:24:12,220
All are
are changing so fast, you know?

1701
02:24:12,245 --> 02:24:15,840
The odds that two young
remain on the same wavelength are ...

1702
02:24:16,151 --> 02:24:18,543
- Yes, but ...
- I also guarantee ...

1703
02:24:18,568 --> 02:24:22,362
every day of your life
you spend crying over a silly girl ...

1704
02:24:22,387 --> 02:24:24,179
It is a waste of time.

1705
02:24:25,289 --> 02:24:26,851
But it was not a silly girl.

1706
02:24:26,876 --> 02:24:31,731
It is a serious person.
I really thought ...
#What?

1707
02:24:32,255 --> 02:24:33,314
I dunno.

1708
02:24:34,391 --> 02:24:37,300
The truth is that
Women are never satisfied.

1709
02:24:37,832 --> 02:24:40,102
They are always
redeem looking model.

1710
02:24:40,127 --> 02:24:43,934
Sorry, but that
is what happened to you, great friend.

1711
02:24:43,959 --> 02:24:45,363
What does that mean?

1712
02:24:45,512 --> 02:24:50,344
It means that you give not
control of your self-esteem Sheila.
#Sheena.

1713
02:24:50,369 --> 02:24:54,833
It means that you are responsible for
yourself. Not your girlfriend, your mom, or me.

1714
02:24:58,092 --> 02:25:02,658
you be surprised how many girls
Sheena as knocking at your door.

1715
02:25:04,202 --> 02:25:08,286
Great.
#You have to find a way  to separate you from the pack.

1716
02:25:08,311 --> 02:25:10,044
You excel at something, you know?

1717
02:25:10,069 --> 02:25:14,545
And there you can choose what you want
herd when you advanced ...
#start to sniff.

1718
02:25:14,570 --> 02:25:18,755
So I should devote myself to lacrosse.
#Right.

1719
02:25:18,980 --> 02:25:22,813
O ... form a rock band.
#It worked for me long ago

1720
02:25:23,138 --> 02:25:27,669
And it still functions Jimmy.
#O still taking pictures.

1721
02:25:28,189 --> 02:25:32,211
She hated the pictures I took him.
#I'm sick of it.

1722
02:25:32,236 --> 02:25:34,641
I only saw a couple
times and, yes, it was cute.

1723
02:25:34,966 --> 02:25:38,023
But in truth,
I always thought that was a bit ...

1724
02:25:38,680 --> 02:25:42,721
a bit boring for you.
#They were not on the same wavelength.

1725
02:25:43,092 --> 02:25:46,333
You know what occurred to me?
#He was at a lower level.

1726
02:25:48,508 --> 02:25:53,072
I was not surprised that
are interested in lacrosse baby.

1727
02:25:55,408 --> 02:25:58,497
Basically, it all depends
of time on these things.

1728
02:26:00,990 --> 02:26:04,357
Look at your mom and me.
#I think I've become ...

1729
02:26:04,382 --> 02:26:08,197
type boring and neutered
she wanted 15-20 years ago.

1730
02:26:08,787 --> 02:26:11,104
I'm not saying he was wrong to be angry.

1731
02:26:11,129 --> 02:26:13,805
I'm just saying it could
have been a little more patient.

1732
02:26:14,154 --> 02:26:18,270
A little more forgiving.
#I would have saved  the parade of drunken morons.

1733
02:26:27,181 --> 02:26:28,397
What's the point?

1734
02:26:30,008 --> 02:26:31,040
What?

1735
02:26:32,102 --> 02:26:34,424
I dunno. This. Everything.

1736
02:26:35,709 --> 02:26:36,813
Everything?

1737
02:26:37,824 --> 02:26:40,672
What's the point?
What the fuck do I know?

1738
02:26:41,937 --> 02:26:44,503
Neither one knows why. All ...

1739
02:26:44,528 --> 02:26:48,552
improvise, you know?
The good thing is that you feel things.

1740
02:26:49,514 --> 02:26:51,259
And you have to hold on to that.

1741
02:26:52,384 --> 02:26:56,015
You grow up and do not feel much.
The skin becomes hard.

1742
02:26:56,415 --> 02:27:01,241
The sense you get is the photos.
#They sent photos  statewide and you won.

1743
02:27:02,593 --> 02:27:03,849
I won silver.

1744
02:27:04,853 --> 02:27:09,306
Along with others.
#What I'm saying is that I believe in you, Mason.

1745
02:27:09,331 --> 02:27:13,226
I think you're special. And if you
girl can not see, fuck.

1746
02:27:15,086 --> 02:27:17,974
This issue is dedicated
a young present.

1747
02:27:18,799 --> 02:27:21,063
I met him when I was a kid.

1748
02:27:21,488 --> 02:27:26,080
Now finished school
secondary and makes me feel old.

1749
02:27:27,805 --> 02:27:29,739
You graduate, Mason.

1750
02:27:57,380 --> 02:27:58,284
Thank you.

1751
02:27:59,590 --> 02:28:03,366
The record straight.
There will be four categories.

1752
02:28:03,391 --> 02:28:06,789
A:Anything
childhood who want to carry.

1753
02:28:07,198 --> 02:28:11,186
Two:Things to shoot.
#Three:Things to donate.

1754
02:28:11,211 --> 02:28:14,697
Four:What we want to try to
sell at the show this weekend.

1755
02:28:14,722 --> 02:28:17,425
What is not sold will be donated.

1756
02:28:17,450 --> 02:28:21,726
Does the apartment does not have
an attic, storage or something?

1757
02:28:22,153 --> 02:28:24,487
No. You do not understand.

1758
02:28:24,512 --> 02:28:27,846
We will not take crap
old my little apartment.

1759
02:28:28,469 --> 02:28:30,385
Another move, can not believe it.

1760
02:28:30,410 --> 02:28:34,571
I move. You moved in like two years ago.
Have an apartment in Austin.

1761
02:28:34,797 --> 02:28:38,114
Mason moves in the fall.
#I finished!

1762
02:28:38,455 --> 02:28:42,663
It will be great. I will have many options.
Me I can take a sabbatical.

1763
02:28:42,688 --> 02:28:45,416
I can devote myself to writing.
Get to publish me.

1764
02:28:45,441 --> 02:28:49,263
What about Christmas?
What will we do?
#I will not share a room with him.

1765
02:28:49,288 --> 02:28:52,797
One of you will sleep on the couch.
We will use the inflatable mattress.

1766
02:28:53,798 --> 02:28:55,777
And how to wash my clothes?

1767
02:28:56,685 --> 02:28:59,734
I'm giving a
nudge to leave the nest.

1768
02:29:00,059 --> 02:29:04,340
And perhaps falling magically
find some coins ...

1769
02:29:04,365 --> 02:29:06,820
to wash clothes
in your own apartment.

1770
02:29:07,680 --> 02:29:10,888
But please! You are ... adults.

1771
02:29:10,913 --> 02:29:15,241
They have to take responsibility.
#What do they want?

1772
02:29:16,232 --> 02:29:21,002
I the veggie burger.
#Nothing for me. I'm not hungry.

1773
02:29:21,529 --> 02:29:25,181
What's wrong?
#I feel bad.

1774
02:29:25,606 --> 02:29:30,132
What do you have? Does the head? Do you have a fever?
#You are pregnant.

1775
02:29:32,028 --> 02:29:35,283
In fact, I drank too much last night.

1776
02:29:35,308 --> 02:29:37,653
- There were driving, right?
- No, no.

1777
02:29:37,978 --> 02:29:40,910
Carrie is back too.
The spent together.

1778
02:29:41,847 --> 02:29:46,007
- A drink with Jack Daniel's that down ...
- No, no.

1779
02:29:46,232 --> 02:29:47,686
No excuse.

1780
02:29:47,711 --> 02:29:51,798
Like you can fill boxes. People
you want to move as fast as possible.

1781
02:29:52,614 --> 02:29:54,531
Hello.
#Ernesto'm Larrio.

1782
02:29:55,731 --> 02:30:00,059
She did not remember me, but ...
#I am the pipe a few years ago.

1783
02:30:00,284 --> 02:30:03,779
Right.
#Believe it or not, it changed my life.

1784
02:30:04,230 --> 02:30:07,713
I said I was
intelligent and had to go to uni.

1785
02:30:08,588 --> 02:30:11,489
And I took his advice.
#First with English classes.

1786
02:30:11,514 --> 02:30:14,796
A year later I went to college
communal and managed a tertiary degree.

1787
02:30:14,821 --> 02:30:18,807
Now I'm in uni
state after licensure.
#And I am one of the managers here.

1788
02:30:18,832 --> 02:30:19,785
Hottie!

1789
02:30:20,845 --> 02:30:24,759
Glad to see it and to have
the opportunity to thank them.

1790
02:30:26,465 --> 02:30:30,885
It was a big deal for me.
#Lunch is on me.

1791
02:30:30,910 --> 02:30:35,657
- It's the least I can do.
- Thank you.
#Let her case. It's a smart woman.

1792
02:30:36,825 --> 02:30:37,829
Thank you.

1793
02:30:55,461 --> 02:30:57,789
twenty questions on a form.

1794
02:30:57,814 --> 02:31:00,997
There seems to be only
Eight types of people worldwide.

1795
02:31:01,022 --> 02:31:03,963
There are subsets
as males and females, but ...

1796
02:31:03,988 --> 02:31:06,977
apparently we are not
as unique as we think.

1797
02:31:07,002 --> 02:31:11,768
Have you talked to him?
#No, but we exchanged messages.

1798
02:31:12,359 --> 02:31:14,774
It looks nice. Literature Study ...

1799
02:31:14,799 --> 02:31:19,270
and anthropology, and loves
Bright Eyes, which is a good thing.

1800
02:31:19,295 --> 02:31:21,761
And he told me that ...

1801
02:31:21,786 --> 02:31:25,077
the system to assign peers
bedroom gives a little scary.

1802
02:31:25,715 --> 02:31:29,725
The satisfaction rate of the Nerds
with peers used to be 60%.

1803
02:31:29,750 --> 02:31:33,183
And now it is 100%.
#Only by the computer.

1804
02:31:34,520 --> 02:31:36,337
It will be a good companion, then.

1805
02:31:37,220 --> 02:31:42,013
But we conclude that ...
#soon will not need a questionnaire.

1806
02:31:42,038 --> 02:31:45,140
The NSA will scan
your digital ghost and ...

1807
02:31:45,165 --> 02:31:47,271
they will tell you who your partner,

1808
02:31:47,296 --> 02:31:50,472
based on everything
ever said, wrote or you clicked.

1809
02:31:51,397 --> 02:31:56,163
You put it in again?
#I do not want.

1810
02:31:56,188 --> 02:31:58,875
Come on! It's the first picture you get.

1811
02:32:00,405 --> 02:32:02,966
Precisely why I leave, right?

1812
02:32:19,423 --> 02:32:22,886
- What's up?
- Nothing!
#Mom, what's wrong?

1813
02:32:23,111 --> 02:32:24,261
Nothing!

1814
02:32:25,447 --> 02:32:26,474
Mom ...

1815
02:32:29,556 --> 02:32:33,893
It's the worst day of my life!
#What are you talking about?

1816
02:32:33,918 --> 02:32:38,386
I knew this day would come.
#I could not imagine  you'd be so happy to go!

1817
02:32:39,896 --> 02:32:43,120
Not that I'm so happy.
What did you expect?

1818
02:32:43,145 --> 02:32:46,976
You know what I'm thinking?
That my life is just like that!

1819
02:32:47,001 --> 02:32:48,958
These milestones of life.

1820
02:32:49,308 --> 02:32:52,413
Getting married, having children, divorce.

1821
02:32:52,438 --> 02:32:57,224
That time when
thought you were dyslexic.
#When I taught you to ride a bike!

1822
02:32:57,967 --> 02:33:01,296
Getting divorced ... again!
Getting my masters.

1823
02:33:01,321 --> 02:33:03,227
Finally getting the job you wanted.

1824
02:33:03,336 --> 02:33:06,839
Send to Samantha to uni.
Sending you to college!

1825
02:33:06,864 --> 02:33:10,463
You know what follows, eh?
My fucking funeral!

1826
02:33:13,235 --> 02:33:15,219
Go away and leave my photo!

1827
02:33:17,346 --> 02:33:20,564
Have not you're getting ahead forty years?

1828
02:33:23,938 --> 02:33:26,899
I just thought that ... would be more.

1829
02:33:42,620 --> 02:33:44,345
<I> Let go </ i>

1830
02:33:45,714 --> 02:33:49,888
<I> not wanna be your hero </ i>

1831
02:33:51,320 --> 02:33:54,737
<I> do not want to be a great man </ i>

1832
02:33:55,484 --> 02:33:58,316
<I> just want to fight with all </ i>

1833
02:33:59,706 --> 02:34:02,387
<I> Your farce </ i>

1834
02:34:03,627 --> 02:34:07,691
<I> do not want to be part of your parade </ i>

1835
02:34:09,161 --> 02:34:12,361
<I> Everyone deserves a chance to </ i>

1836
02:34:13,606 --> 02:34:15,990
<I> Walking with everyone else </ i>

1837
02:34:17,594 --> 02:34:20,229
<I> While I keep </ i>

1838
02:34:21,474 --> 02:34:25,715
<I> A work to be with my girl </ i>

1839
02:34:27,118 --> 02:34:30,078
<I> And maybe buy new strings </ i>

1840
02:34:31,080 --> 02:34:33,936
<I> out with her on weekends </ i>

1841
02:34:37,839 --> 02:34:40,714
<I> And we can whisper things </ i>

1842
02:34:42,013 --> 02:34:46,166
<I> Secrets of our American dreams </ i>

1843
02:34:49,049 --> 02:34:51,985
<I> The baby needs protection </ i>

1844
02:34:53,003 --> 02:34:55,706
<I> But I'm a child like everyone else </ i>

1845
02:35:00,016 --> 02:35:02,701
<I> Well let me go </ i>

1846
02:35:03,927 --> 02:35:07,761
<I> not wanna be your hero </ i>

1847
02:35:09,481 --> 02:35:12,699
<I> do not want to be a great man </ i>

1848
02:35:13,429 --> 02:35:15,924
<I> just want to fight like everyone else </ i>

1849
02:35:43,104 --> 02:35:45,466
You must be Mason.
#Dalton, right?

1850
02:35:45,491 --> 02:35:49,439
How nice to finally meet you.
#Does this side is good for you?

1851
02:35:49,972 --> 02:35:53,413
- Yes.
- I arrived in the morning and threw everything there.

1852
02:35:54,342 --> 02:35:56,510
All right. Do not worry.

1853
02:35:56,723 --> 02:35:59,356
Need help with something? Suitcases ?

1854
02:35:59,381 --> 02:36:02,490
I can only box
and is quite light, but ...

1855
02:36:02,515 --> 02:36:04,787
- I thank you.
- You're welcome.

1856
02:36:08,490 --> 02:36:11,034
Will you go to the orientation?

1857
02:36:11,877 --> 02:36:14,015
Orientation Meeting?

1858
02:36:14,334 --> 02:36:17,806
Fuck that! I will not go.
And neither, for that matter.

1859
02:36:17,831 --> 02:36:22,290
We have better things to do.
- Ready?  - Yeah Hey ... Barb.

1860
02:36:22,315 --> 02:36:24,460
my mate
fourth Mason. Mason, Barb.

1861
02:36:25,245 --> 02:36:27,512
- Are you coming with us?
- Where are they going?

1862
02:36:28,280 --> 02:36:30,369
- A day trip.
- Yes, come with us.

1863
02:36:30,394 --> 02:36:35,204
If we leave now we will see
sunset in Big Bend. Do you know?
#Child.

1864
02:36:35,229 --> 02:36:38,772
More reason to come now.
That's why we're here.

1865
02:36:40,546 --> 02:36:43,383
Mason, she is Nicole,
Barb companion.

1866
02:36:43,508 --> 02:36:45,559
- What about?
- Hi.

1867
02:36:45,584 --> 02:36:50,448
- Mason, Nicole.
- So? Are you coming?
#Sure.

1868
02:36:51,390 --> 02:36:53,301
Here, this ends.

1869
02:36:53,305 --> 02:36:56,662
The perfect time. He pasted
when we get to the mountains.

1870
02:36:56,987 --> 02:36:58,371
Hottie! Underway.

1871
02:37:05,718 --> 02:37:09,679
Would you allow the main subject?
#Well, it's not so important here ...

1872
02:37:09,704 --> 02:37:12,071
so I train
out of college, but ...

1873
02:37:12,096 --> 02:37:15,160
course all the basics here
as dance history and stuff.

1874
02:37:17,414 --> 02:37:20,091
What do you teach?
#Oops! Good ...

1875
02:37:20,423 --> 02:37:23,571
Ballet, tap dancing
American, jazz, hip hop ...

1876
02:37:24,426 --> 02:37:26,499
- Which do you prefer?
- The stomping.

1877
02:37:28,158 --> 02:37:30,926
You can invent ...
your own sounds and ...

1878
02:37:30,951 --> 02:37:34,980
no rules. There is freedom to create.
- That's good.  - Yes.

1879
02:37:35,113 --> 02:37:36,905
So I like to teach it, then ...

1880
02:37:36,930 --> 02:37:40,684
It is so beautiful to me and is
turning in this generation.

1881
02:37:40,709 --> 02:37:44,938
Help give back to the kids.
#It is very rewarding.

1882
02:37:45,583 --> 02:37:47,369
- How old are they?
- Sixteen

1883
02:37:48,851 --> 02:37:51,807
Not afraid
and they are not shy at all.

1884
02:37:51,832 --> 02:37:55,984
Not yet arrived
at age a sense of embarrassment.
#No. I will come to you.

1885
02:38:24,650 --> 02:38:27,348
Dalton do crazy things sometimes.

1886
02:38:28,292 --> 02:38:32,269
Looks good people.
#Yes. Yes, both are.

1887
02:38:36,155 --> 02:38:37,312
How do you feel?

1888
02:38:40,026 --> 02:38:43,538
All right.
#Very well, in fact.

1889
02:38:44,840 --> 02:38:45,773
All right.

1890
02:38:48,609 --> 02:38:51,318
Glad you have joined the group.

1891
02:38:51,543 --> 02:38:54,151
Me too.

1892
02:38:55,653 --> 02:38:58,805
The moment is having
a wonderful orgasm!

1893
02:38:58,830 --> 02:39:03,345
It is as if all time had
deployed so that we are here ...

1894
02:39:03,370 --> 02:39:05,928
and look and shout:Fuck, yeah!

1895
02:39:11,827 --> 02:39:16,211
Did you see how people
always says "seize the moment"?

1896
02:39:19,573 --> 02:39:22,352
I tend to think that is backwards.

1897
02:39:24,450 --> 02:39:27,268
The moment captures us.
#Yes.

1898
02:39:27,838 --> 02:39:30,999
Yes, of course, is ... is constant.

1899
02:39:31,024 --> 02:39:33,077
The time is ...

1900
02:39:34,278 --> 02:39:36,725
It's like always
out now, you know?

1901
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:41,094
Yes.
