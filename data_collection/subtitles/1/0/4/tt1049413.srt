<i>Muntz conceived the craft

Gentlemen, I give you the
Monster of Paradise Falls!

25
00:01:56,901 --> 00:02:00,700
<i>And gully, what a
swell monster this is!</i>

26
00:02:00,735 --> 00:02:04,464
<i>But what's this?

I'll take that as a no, then.

I believe I made my position
to your boss quite clear.

You poured prune
juice in his gas tank.

00:17:12,363 --> 00:17:15,241
- If only someone could help me...
- Me, me, I'll do it!

178
00:17:15,276 --> 00:17:17,576
I don't know, it's
awfully crafty.

179
00:17:17,618 --> 00:17:19,829
You'd have to clap
your hands three times

180
00:17:19,864 --> 00:17:20,920
to lure it in.

181
00:17:20,955 --> 00:17:22,421
I'll find her,
mr. Fredricksen!

182
00:17:22,456 --> 00:17:24,542
I think its burrow
is two blocks down...

183
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:26,085
Two blocks down. Got it!

184
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,013
Snipe! Here, snipie, snipie...

185
00:17:31,048 --> 00:17:32,967
Bring it back here
when you find it!

186
00:17:33,002 --> 00:17:34,510
Snipe!

187
00:17:37,805 --> 00:17:40,224
And stop. Stop. Stop!

188
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,560
Hey, hey!

189
00:17:42,601 --> 00:17:46,814
Hey, you! What do you
think you're doing?

190
00:17:46,849 --> 00:17:48,374
I am so sorry, sir.

191
00:17:48,409 --> 00:17:49,865
Don't touch that!

192
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,235
No, no, no, let me take
care of that for you.

193
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,409
Get away from our mailbox!

194
00:17:52,444 --> 00:17:54,488
- Sir...
- I don't want you to touch that!

195
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:11,422
It looks bad.

196
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:34,695
<i>COURT SUMMONS</i>

197
00:18:43,245 --> 00:18:44,538
Sorry, mr. Fredricksen.

198
00:18:45,414 --> 00:18:47,750
You don't seem like
a public menace to me.

199
00:18:47,785 --> 00:18:49,466
Take this.

200
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:52,421
The guys from "Shady Oaks" will be
by to pick you up in the morning, ok?

201
00:19:07,478 --> 00:19:09,480
What do I do now, Ellie?

202
00:20:39,611 --> 00:20:40,911
Good morning, gentlemen.

203
00:20:40,946 --> 00:20:42,656
Good morning, mr. Fredricksen.

204
00:20:42,698 --> 00:20:43,949
You're ready to go?

205
00:20:45,451 --> 00:20:47,459
Ready as I'll ever be.

206
00:20:47,494 --> 00:20:49,517
Would you do me the
favour and take this?

207
00:20:49,552 --> 00:20:51,505
I'll meet you in the
van in just a minute.

208
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:56,295
I... wanna say one last
goodbye to the old place.

209
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,922
Sure. Take all the
time you need, sir.

210
00:21:02,009 --> 00:21:05,804
That's typical. He's probably going
to the bathroom for the 80th time.

211
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:10,809
You'd think he'd take
better care of his house.

212
00:21:51,266 --> 00:21:52,983
So long, boys!

213
00:21:53,018 --> 00:21:58,148
I'll send you a postcard
from Paradise Falls!

214
00:22:51,368 --> 00:22:56,707
<i>SOUTH AMERICA</i>

215
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,612
We are on our way, Ellie.

216
00:24:36,431 --> 00:24:37,995
Hi, mr. Fredricksen.

217
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,559
It's me, Russell.

218
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:42,051
What are you doing
out here, kid?

219
00:24:42,086 --> 00:24:45,715
I found the snipe and I
followed it under your porch.

220
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,266
But this snipe had a long tail

221
00:24:48,301 --> 00:24:51,179
and looked more
like a large mouse.

222
00:24:56,851 --> 00:24:58,853
Please, let me in.

223
00:24:58,895 --> 00:25:02,065
No.

224
00:25:04,442 --> 00:25:06,944
Aw, all right. You can...

225
00:25:07,945 --> 00:25:09,072
come... in.

226
00:25:18,873 --> 00:25:21,167
I've never been in a
floating house before.

227
00:25:22,627 --> 00:25:25,088
Goggles...
Look at this stuff!

228
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:26,971
Are you going on a trip?

229
00:25:27,006 --> 00:25:30,475
"Paradise Falls, a
land lost in time".

230
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,637
Are you going to South
America, mr. Fredricksen?

231
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,823
Don't touch that!
You'll soil it.

232
00:25:34,858 --> 00:25:36,974
You know, most
people take a plane.

233
00:25:37,009 --> 00:25:38,191
But you're smart,

234
00:25:38,226 --> 00:25:40,269
because you have your
TV, clocks and stuff.

235
00:25:40,311 --> 00:25:42,563
Ooo, is this how
you steer your house?

236
00:25:43,356 --> 00:25:47,026
Does it really work?

237
00:25:47,318 --> 00:25:51,823
This makes it turn right
and that way is left.

238
00:25:51,906 --> 00:25:54,624
Hey, look! Buildings!

239
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:58,538
That building's so close,
I can almost touch it!

240
00:25:59,956 --> 00:26:03,132
Wow, this is great!

241
00:26:03,167 --> 00:26:05,218
You should try this,
mr. Fredricksen.

242
00:26:05,253 --> 00:26:08,381
Look, there's a bus that could
take me home two blocks away!

243
00:26:08,416 --> 00:26:11,300
Hey, I can see your
house from here!

244
00:26:12,343 --> 00:26:14,178
Don't jerk around
so much, kid!

245
00:26:14,428 --> 00:26:17,897
Well, that's not gonna work.

246
00:26:17,932 --> 00:26:21,310
I know that cloud,
it's a "cumulonimbus".

247
00:26:21,345 --> 00:26:24,564
Did you know that
a cumulonimbus...

248
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:29,902
Aaa, I stayed up all night
blowing up ballons... for what?

249
00:26:29,937 --> 00:26:31,863
That's nice, kid.

250
00:26:38,494 --> 00:26:41,747
What are you doing over there?

251
00:26:41,782 --> 00:26:44,917
Look!

252
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:56,846
See? Cumulonimbus.

253
00:27:32,256 --> 00:27:33,633
My bag!

254
00:27:39,055 --> 00:27:40,097
Got you!

255
00:28:16,342 --> 00:28:19,095
Uuu, I thought you were dead.

256
00:28:22,014 --> 00:28:23,064
What happened?

257
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:26,352
I steered us. I did
it! I steered the house.

258
00:28:26,394 --> 00:28:27,818
You steered us?

259
00:28:27,853 --> 00:28:30,523
After you tied your stuff
down, you took a nap.

260
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:33,818
So I went ahead and
steered us down here.

261
00:28:33,853 --> 00:28:37,530
Yeah, sure.

262
00:28:46,872 --> 00:28:49,548
I can't tell where we are.

263
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:51,342
O, we're in South
America all right.

264
00:28:51,377 --> 00:28:55,214
It was a singe. I used my
wilderness explorer GPS.

265
00:28:55,249 --> 00:28:56,389
GP... what?

266
00:28:56,424 --> 00:28:57,890
My dad gave it to me.

267
00:28:57,925 --> 00:29:02,471
It shows exactly where
we are on the planet.

268
00:29:02,506 --> 00:29:07,226
With this baby
we'll never be lost!

269
00:29:07,268 --> 00:29:11,105
Ups.

270
00:29:12,773 --> 00:29:16,867
We'll get you down,
find a bus stop,

271
00:29:16,902 --> 00:29:20,197
and you'll just tell the man you
want to get back to your mother.

272
00:29:20,239 --> 00:29:23,826
Sure, but I don't think they
have buses in Paradise Falls.

273
00:29:24,285 --> 00:29:26,961
There, that ought to do it.

274
00:29:26,996 --> 00:29:30,374
There, I'll give you some
change for the bus fare.

275
00:29:30,409 --> 00:29:33,043
No, I'll just use
my city bus pass.

276
00:29:33,085 --> 00:29:39,300
It's just gonna be like a billion
passes to get back to my house.

277
00:29:44,054 --> 00:29:45,598
Mr. Fredricksen,
how much longer?

278
00:29:45,633 --> 00:29:48,138
Well, we're up pretty high.

279
00:29:48,173 --> 00:29:50,644
It'll take hours to get down.

280
00:29:52,938 --> 00:29:55,149
I think that was a
building or something.

281
00:29:57,109 --> 00:29:58,826
What was that,
mr. Fredricksen?

282
00:29:58,861 --> 00:30:02,656
We can't be close
to the ground yet.

283
00:30:10,623 --> 00:30:12,499
Wait, no, no!

284
00:30:14,084 --> 00:30:15,544
Wait, wait!

285
00:30:19,215 --> 00:30:22,676
Hang on!

286
00:30:34,855 --> 00:30:36,982
Pull back!

287
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:53,213
Where... where are we?

288
00:30:53,248 --> 00:30:57,461
This doesn't look like the city
or the jungle, mr. Fredricksen.

289
00:30:58,212 --> 00:31:03,509
Don't worry,
Ellie. I've got it.

290
00:31:26,865 --> 00:31:32,037
There it is!

291
00:31:57,646 --> 00:32:00,983
Ellie, it's so beautiful!

292
00:32:01,018 --> 00:32:03,283
We made it!

293
00:32:03,318 --> 00:32:07,030
We made it! Russell, we
can float right over there.

294
00:32:07,065 --> 00:32:08,997
Climb up, climb up!

295
00:32:09,032 --> 00:32:10,165
Do you mean... assist you?

296
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,286
- Yeah, whatever.
- Ok, I'll climb up!

297
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:19,751
- Watch it!
- Sorry.

298
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:31,430
When you get up there,
go ahead and hoist me up.

299
00:32:32,806 --> 00:32:34,349
Got it?

300
00:32:38,103 --> 00:32:39,813
Are you on the porch yet?

301
00:32:46,695 --> 00:32:48,162
What? That's it?

302
00:32:48,197 --> 00:32:53,869
I came all this way here to get stuck
on the wrong end of this rock pile?

303
00:32:55,829 --> 00:32:58,207
Ah... great.

304
00:33:00,334 --> 00:33:03,462
Hey, if I could assist
you over there...

305
00:33:03,497 --> 00:33:06,506
would you sign
up for my badge?

306
00:33:06,541 --> 00:33:07,973
What are you talking about?

307
00:33:08,008 --> 00:33:10,177
We could walk your
house to the fall.

308
00:33:10,477 --> 00:33:12,179
- Walk it?
- Yeah.

309
00:33:12,221 --> 00:33:15,974
After all we weigh it down, we
could walk it right over there.

310
00:33:16,009 --> 00:33:18,185
Like a parade balloon.

311
00:33:22,231 --> 00:33:25,525
Now, we'll walk to the
falls quickly and quietly,

312
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,784
with no rap music
or flash dancing.

313
00:33:27,819 --> 00:33:32,491
We have three days at best till the
helium leaks out of those balloons.

314
00:33:32,526 --> 00:33:35,661
And if we are not at the
falls when that happens...

315
00:33:35,696 --> 00:33:37,955
we're not getting
to the falls.

316
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:40,245
There... I found sand!

317
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,466
Don't you worry, Ellie.

318
00:33:42,501 --> 00:33:44,753
We'll get our
house over there.

319
00:33:49,341 --> 00:33:51,218
It is fun already, isn't it?

320
00:33:51,253 --> 00:33:53,095
By the time we get there,

321
00:33:53,136 --> 00:33:56,723
You're gonna feel so
assisted... Oh, mr. Fredricksen,

322
00:33:56,758 --> 00:33:59,013
if we happen to get separated,

323
00:33:59,048 --> 00:34:01,269
use the wilderness
explorer call.

324
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,526
Wait, why are we going
to Paradise Falls, again?

325
00:34:07,567 --> 00:34:09,159
Hey, let's play a game.

326
00:34:09,194 --> 00:34:12,864
It's called: "See who
can be quiet the longest".

327
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:15,200
Cool! My mom loves that game!

328
00:35:18,096 --> 00:35:21,516
Darn thing...

329
00:35:21,558 --> 00:35:23,727
Come on, Russell, hurry it up.

330
00:35:23,762 --> 00:35:25,684
Ah, I'm tired.

331
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:27,851
My knee hurts.

332
00:35:27,886 --> 00:35:29,983
Which knee?

333
00:35:30,025 --> 00:35:34,321
My elbow hurts and I have
to go to the bathroom.

334
00:35:34,356 --> 00:35:36,907
I asked you about
that five minutes ago.

335
00:35:36,942 --> 00:35:40,553
I didn't have to go then!

336
00:35:40,588 --> 00:35:44,164
I don't wanna walk anymore...

337
00:35:44,206 --> 00:35:47,215
Please, stop...

338
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,878
Russell, if you don't hurry
up, the tigers will eat you.

339
00:35:49,913 --> 00:35:52,631
There are no tigers
in South America.

340
00:35:52,666 --> 00:35:56,801
Zoology.

341
00:35:56,843 --> 00:36:00,013
Ah, for the love of Pete... Go on
into the bushes and do your business.

342
00:36:00,048 --> 00:36:03,683
Ok. Here! Hold my stuff!

343
00:36:03,808 --> 00:36:06,520
I've always
wanted to try this.

344
00:36:09,814 --> 00:36:15,237
Mr. Fredricksen, am I suppose
to dig the hole before or after?

345
00:36:15,272 --> 00:36:18,532
That's none of my concern.

346
00:36:18,573 --> 00:36:21,618
Oh, it's "before"!

347
00:36:29,459 --> 00:36:30,752
Tracks?

348
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:33,678
Snipe.

349
00:36:33,713 --> 00:36:36,556
Here, snipe.

350
00:36:36,591 --> 00:36:38,718
Come on out, snipe.

351
00:36:38,753 --> 00:36:41,137
Snipe!

352
00:37:01,449 --> 00:37:03,994
Got you. Don't be
afraid, little snipe.

353
00:37:04,029 --> 00:37:05,794
I am a wilderness explorer,

354
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:08,790
so I'm a friend
to all of nature.

355
00:37:08,825 --> 00:37:13,545
Want some more?

356
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,922
Hi, boy. Don't eat it all.

357
00:37:15,957 --> 00:37:17,799
Come on out.

358
00:37:19,759 --> 00:37:22,268
Come on. Come on...

359
00:37:22,303 --> 00:37:24,847
Don't be afraid, little snipe.

360
00:37:24,882 --> 00:37:27,392
Nice snipe. Good little snipe.

361
00:37:27,427 --> 00:37:31,855
Nice giant... snipe!

362
00:37:35,608 --> 00:37:38,194
I found the snipe.

363
00:37:38,229 --> 00:37:40,829
Oh, did you?

364
00:37:40,864 --> 00:37:42,657
- Are they tall?
- Oh, yes. They're very tall.

365
00:37:42,692 --> 00:37:44,242
Do they have a lot of colors?

366
00:37:44,277 --> 00:37:45,750
They do, indeed.

367
00:37:45,785 --> 00:37:48,288
- Do they like chocolate?
- Oh, yeah...

368
00:37:48,323 --> 00:37:51,583
Chocolate?

369
00:37:51,624 --> 00:37:53,835
What is that thing?

370
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,927
It's a snipe.

371
00:37:55,962 --> 00:37:58,548
There no such
thing as a snipe!

372
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:01,509
But you said...

373
00:38:01,551 --> 00:38:04,262
Go on, get out of here! Go!

374
00:38:13,229 --> 00:38:16,281
Careful, Russell.

375
00:38:16,316 --> 00:38:19,861
Look, mr. Fredricksen,
he likes me.

376
00:38:19,903 --> 00:38:23,406
- Russell!
- No, stop! That tickles!

377
00:38:23,441 --> 00:38:26,117
Get out of here!
Go on! Get!

378
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:36,815
No, no, no. Kevin, it's ok.

379
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:40,054
Mr. Fredricksen is nice.

380
00:38:40,089 --> 00:38:42,634
- Kevin?
- Yes, that's the name I just gave him.

381
00:38:42,801 --> 00:38:44,990
Bit it, boo, scram!

382
00:38:45,025 --> 00:38:47,180
Hey, that's mine!

383
00:38:51,476 --> 00:38:54,145
Shoo, shoo! Get out of here!

384
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,397
Go on, bit it!

385
00:39:02,153 --> 00:39:04,537
Can we keep him? Please?

386
00:39:04,572 --> 00:39:07,200
I'll get the food for him, I'll walk
him, I'll change his newspapers...

387
00:39:07,235 --> 00:39:09,202
No.

388
00:39:09,285 --> 00:39:11,961
An explorer is
a friend to all,

389
00:39:11,996 --> 00:39:14,040
be it a plant, a
fish or a tiny mole.

390
00:39:14,082 --> 00:39:16,459
That doesn't even rhyme.

391
00:39:16,494 --> 00:39:18,419
Yeah, it does.

392
00:39:18,461 --> 00:39:20,303
- Hey, look, Kevin.
- What?

393
00:39:20,338 --> 00:39:23,299
Hey, get down from there!
You're not allowed up there!

394
00:39:25,468 --> 00:39:30,223
You come down here right now!

395
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,561
Can you believe this, Ellie?

396
00:39:34,596 --> 00:39:37,570
Ellie?

397
00:39:37,605 --> 00:39:40,024
Hey, Ellie, can
I keep the bird?

398
00:39:40,059 --> 00:39:42,610
Aha.

399
00:39:42,652 --> 00:39:45,370
She said for you to let me.

400
00:39:45,405 --> 00:39:47,782
But I told him
no. I told you no.

401
00:39:47,817 --> 00:39:50,159
N
- o!

402
00:40:00,461 --> 00:40:03,131
I see you, back there.

403
00:40:05,091 --> 00:40:08,469
Go on, get out of here! Shoo! Go
annoy someone else for a while.

404
00:40:08,504 --> 00:40:11,306
Hey, are you ok over there?

405
00:40:13,474 --> 00:40:16,853
Hello?

406
00:40:21,532 --> 00:40:24,709
Oh, hello, sir.
Thank Goodness.

407
00:40:24,744 --> 00:40:27,663
It's nice to know
someone else is up here.

408
00:40:27,698 --> 00:40:29,415
I can smell you.

409
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:31,674
What?

410
00:40:31,709 --> 00:40:34,524
You can... smell us?

411
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:37,340
I can smell you.

412
00:40:44,472 --> 00:40:47,683
- Hey!
- You were talking to a rock.

413
00:40:47,718 --> 00:40:50,895
Hey, that one
looks like a turtle.

414
00:40:50,936 --> 00:40:53,272
Look at that one! That
one looks like a dog!

415
00:40:54,148 --> 00:40:57,033
- Ah, it is a dog.
- What?

416
00:40:57,068 --> 00:41:00,988
We're not allowed to have
dogs in my appartment.

417
00:41:01,155 --> 00:41:04,679
Hey, I like dogs!

418
00:41:04,714 --> 00:41:08,169
We have your dog!

419
00:41:08,204 --> 00:41:09,872
- I wonder whom he belongs to.
- Sit, boy.

420
00:41:09,907 --> 00:41:11,665
Hey, look, he's trained!

421
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,715
Shake.

422
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,606
Aha. Speak.

423
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:16,462
Hi, there.

424
00:41:16,962 --> 00:41:19,340
Did that dog just
say "Hi, there"?

425
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:21,258
Oh, yes!

426
00:41:21,384 --> 00:41:24,678
My name is Dug. I just
met you and I love you.

427
00:41:24,887 --> 00:41:27,563
My master made me this collar.

428
00:41:27,598 --> 00:41:31,018
He is a good and smart master
and he made me this collar

429
00:41:31,053 --> 00:41:33,580
so that I may talk. Squirrel!

430
00:41:33,615 --> 00:41:36,107
My master is good and smart.

431
00:41:36,142 --> 00:41:37,406
It's not possible.

432
00:41:37,441 --> 00:41:39,422
It is because my
master is smart.

433
00:41:39,457 --> 00:41:41,403
Hey, cool! What
do these do, boy?

434
00:41:41,438 --> 00:41:44,163
<i>Would you cut...</i>

435
00:41:44,198 --> 00:41:47,535
<i>I'd use that collar... I
would be happy if you stopped.</i>

436
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,752
Russell, don't touch that.

437
00:41:49,787 --> 00:41:51,712
It could be...
radioactive or something.

438
00:41:51,747 --> 00:41:54,083
I am a great tracker. My master
sent me on a special mission.

439
00:41:54,118 --> 00:41:56,592
All by myself. Have
you seen a bird?

440
00:41:56,627 --> 00:41:58,983
I want to find one and
I've been on a scent.

441
00:41:59,018 --> 00:42:01,340
I'm a great tracker.
Did I mention that?

442
00:42:03,175 --> 00:42:07,054
Hey, that is a bird. I have
never seen one up close,

443
00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:08,562
but this is the bird.

444
00:42:08,597 --> 00:42:10,891
May I take your bird up
to camp as my prisoner?

445
00:42:10,926 --> 00:42:12,441
Yes, yes, take it.

446
00:42:12,476 --> 00:42:14,728
And on the way, learn how
to bark like a real dog.

447
00:42:14,763 --> 00:42:16,487
I can bark.

448
00:42:16,522 --> 00:42:18,649
And here's howling.

449
00:42:20,734 --> 00:42:24,113
Can we keep him, please?
Please, please, please?

450
00:42:24,148 --> 00:42:27,491
- No.
- But it's a talking dog!

451
00:42:27,658 --> 00:42:29,618
It's just a weird
trick or something.

452
00:42:29,653 --> 00:42:31,787
Let's get to the fall.

453
00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:36,917
Please, be my prisoner! Oh,
please oh, please, be my prisoner!

454
00:42:38,836 --> 00:42:40,921
Oh, here it is! I picked
up the bird's scent!

455
00:42:40,956 --> 00:42:43,007
Wait a minute, wait a
minute. What is this?

456
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:45,516
Chocolate. I smell chocolate.

457
00:42:45,551 --> 00:42:48,596
I'm getting prunes
and ginger cream.

458
00:42:48,631 --> 00:42:49,895
Who are they?

459
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:52,565
Oh, man, the master
will not be pleased.

460
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,437
We'd better tell him someone
took the bird, right, Alfa?

461
00:42:56,604 --> 00:42:58,404
No.

462
00:42:58,439 --> 00:43:01,358
Soon enough the bird
will be ours again.

463
00:43:01,393 --> 00:43:02,408
Find the scent, my compadres,

464
00:43:02,443 --> 00:43:05,946
and you, too, shall have
much rewarding from the master

465
00:43:05,981 --> 00:43:07,871
for the toil that you did.

466
00:43:07,906 --> 00:43:12,369
Hey, Alfa, I think there's
something wrong with your collar.

467
00:43:12,404 --> 00:43:15,337
You must have broken it.

468
00:43:15,372 --> 00:43:19,501
Yeah. Your voice sounds funny.

469
00:43:19,543 --> 00:43:20,669
Beta, Delta!

470
00:43:20,711 --> 00:43:25,014
Perhaps you
desire... Squirrel!

471
00:43:25,049 --> 00:43:27,551
Perhaps you desire to
challenge the right that

472
00:43:27,586 --> 00:43:30,054
I have been assigned by
my strength and cunning.

473
00:43:30,089 --> 00:43:32,354
No, no. No.

474
00:43:32,389 --> 00:43:35,288
But maybe Dug would.

475
00:43:35,323 --> 00:43:38,187
You might wanna ask him.

476
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:41,106
I wonder if he's found the bird
on his "very special mission".

477
00:43:41,141 --> 00:43:43,240
Do not mention Dug
to me at this time.

478
00:43:43,275 --> 00:43:46,737
His fool's errand will
keep him most occupied...

479
00:43:46,772 --> 00:43:49,163
Most occupied, indeed.

480
00:43:49,198 --> 00:43:51,790
Do you not agree with that
which I'm saying to you now?

481
00:43:51,825 --> 00:43:56,747
Sure. But the second the master finds
out that you sent Dug out by himself,

482
00:43:56,782 --> 00:43:59,958
none of us will get a treat.

483
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,211
You're unwise, my
trusted lieutenant.

484
00:44:03,246 --> 00:44:05,752
This is Alfa. Calling
Dug. Come in, Dug.

485
00:44:05,787 --> 00:44:08,258
<i>Hi, Alfa. Your
voice sounds funny.</i>

486
00:44:08,293 --> 00:44:10,601
I know, I know!

487
00:44:10,636 --> 00:44:13,270
Have you seen the bird?

488
00:44:13,305 --> 00:44:15,432
<i>Oh, yes. The bird
is my prisoner now.</i>

489
00:44:15,467 --> 00:44:17,684
Yeah, right.

490
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:20,569
Impossible. Where are you?

491
00:44:20,604 --> 00:44:23,732
<i>I am here with the bird
and I will bring it back</i>

492
00:44:23,767 --> 00:44:25,442
<i>and then you like
me. Oh, gotta go.</i>

493
00:44:25,477 --> 00:44:27,284
<i>Dug, who are you talking to?</i>

494
00:44:27,319 --> 00:44:29,342
- Wait, wait!
- What is Dug doing?

495
00:44:29,377 --> 00:44:31,365
Why is he with
the small mailman?

496
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,488
Where are they?

497
00:44:33,523 --> 00:44:35,593
There he is.

498
00:44:35,628 --> 00:44:37,663
Come on!

499
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:45,003
Please, oh, please,
be my prisoner.

500
00:44:45,038 --> 00:44:47,554
Dug, stop bothering Kevin!

501
00:44:47,589 --> 00:44:49,466
That man over there
says I can take the bird.

502
00:44:49,501 --> 00:44:51,343
And I love that man there
like he is my master.

503
00:44:51,385 --> 00:44:53,519
I am not your master!

504
00:44:53,554 --> 00:44:55,270
I am warning you
once again, bird!

505
00:44:55,305 --> 00:44:57,266
- Hey, quit it!
- I am jumping on you now, bird!

506
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,518
At this rate we will
never get to the falls!

507
00:45:06,775 --> 00:45:09,493
I am nobody's master, got it?

508
00:45:09,528 --> 00:45:11,822
I don't want you here
and I don't want you here!

509
00:45:11,857 --> 00:45:14,456
I'm stuck with you!

510
00:45:14,491 --> 00:45:16,535
If you two don't clear out of here
by the time I count to three...

511
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:19,705
A ball! Oh, boy,
oh, boy, a ball!

512
00:45:19,746 --> 00:45:22,749
Ball? You want a ball?

513
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:26,545
Yes, I do! I ever
so want the ball!

514
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:27,302
Go get it!

515
00:45:27,337 --> 00:45:29,590
Oh, boy, I will get it
and then bring it back!

516
00:45:29,625 --> 00:45:32,467
Quick, Russell, give
me some chocolate.

517
00:45:32,502 --> 00:45:34,011
- Why?
- Just give to me!

518
00:45:34,046 --> 00:45:35,888
Bird! Bird!

519
00:45:36,013 --> 00:45:39,141
Come on, Russell.

520
00:45:39,474 --> 00:45:42,644
Wait! Wait, mr. Fredricksen!

521
00:45:47,024 --> 00:45:49,318
What are you doing?

522
00:45:53,405 --> 00:45:56,658
Hey, we're pretty far now.

523
00:45:56,693 --> 00:45:58,660
Kevin's gonna miss.

524
00:46:03,415 --> 00:46:07,044
I think that did the trick.

525
00:46:07,252 --> 00:46:09,713
Hi, master.

526
00:46:09,755 --> 00:46:12,174
Afternoon.

527
00:46:36,114 --> 00:46:40,410
Well, thanks for keeping
us dry, anyway, Ellie.

528
00:46:40,445 --> 00:46:42,996
Which one is the front?

529
00:46:43,038 --> 00:46:45,672
Well, boy...

530
00:46:45,707 --> 00:46:50,253
Is this step
three or step five?

531
00:46:50,337 --> 00:46:52,506
There.

532
00:46:55,676 --> 00:47:00,055
All done. That's for you.

533
00:47:05,268 --> 00:47:08,111
Well, tents are hard.

534
00:47:08,146 --> 00:47:11,024
Wait, aren't you
super wilderness guy

535
00:47:11,059 --> 00:47:13,610
with the GPS and the badges?

536
00:47:13,645 --> 00:47:15,404
Yeah, but...

537
00:47:15,654 --> 00:47:18,663
Can I tell you a secret?

538
00:47:18,698 --> 00:47:21,708
- No.
- All right. Here it goes.

539
00:47:21,743 --> 00:47:25,288
I never actually built a
tent before. There! I said it.

540
00:47:25,455 --> 00:47:28,375
You've been camping
before, haven't you?

541
00:47:28,625 --> 00:47:31,468
Well, never outside...

542
00:47:31,503 --> 00:47:34,965
Well, why didn't you ask
your dad how to build a tent?

543
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,135
I don't think he wants
to talk about this stuff.

544
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:41,096
Try him sometime, maybe
he'll surprise you.

545
00:47:41,131 --> 00:47:43,557
He's away alot, I
don't see him much.

546
00:47:43,592 --> 00:47:45,232
He's gotta be home sometime.

547
00:47:45,267 --> 00:47:49,569
I call, but Phyllis told
me I bug him too much.

548
00:47:49,604 --> 00:47:52,732
Phyllis? You call your own
mother by her first name?

549
00:47:52,816 --> 00:47:56,486
- Phyllis isn't my mom.
- Oh!

550
00:48:05,787 --> 00:48:09,583
But he promised he'd come
to my Explorers Ceremony

551
00:48:09,618 --> 00:48:12,377
to pin on my "Assisting
the elderly badge".

552
00:48:12,836 --> 00:48:16,840
So he can show me how
about the tent then, right?

553
00:48:22,637 --> 00:48:26,148
Hey, why don't
you get some sleep?

554
00:48:26,183 --> 00:48:30,103
We don't want to wake the
travelling flea circus.

555
00:48:32,105 --> 00:48:35,233
Dle Fredricksen, Dug says he
wants to take Kevin prisoner.

556
00:48:35,275 --> 00:48:39,112
We have to protect him.

557
00:48:42,115 --> 00:48:44,763
Can Kevin go with us?

558
00:48:44,798 --> 00:48:47,377
All right, he can come.

559
00:48:47,412 --> 00:48:49,748
Promise you won't leave him?

560
00:48:49,783 --> 00:48:50,922
Yeah.

561
00:48:50,957 --> 00:48:55,003
Cross your heart?

562
00:48:59,215 --> 00:49:03,595
Cross my heart.

563
00:49:08,475 --> 00:49:11,645
What have I got
myself into, Ellie?

564
00:49:32,958 --> 00:49:35,669
Good morning, sweetheart.

565
00:49:37,087 --> 00:49:39,881
We'd better get moving.

566
00:49:42,175 --> 00:49:46,972
The bird's gone. Maybe
Russell won't notice.

567
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,098
All right, everybody up!

568
00:49:48,723 --> 00:49:50,850
Where's Kevin?
He's wondered off!

569
00:49:51,184 --> 00:49:53,186
- Dug, find Kevin! Kevin!
- Find the bird, find the bird!

570
00:49:53,353 --> 00:49:56,237
Point!

571
00:49:56,272 --> 00:49:58,233
Oh, look! There he is...

572
00:49:59,609 --> 00:50:01,743
Point!

573
00:50:01,778 --> 00:50:04,864
Hey, that's my roof!
Get off my roof!

574
00:50:04,899 --> 00:50:07,617
Yeah, get off of his WROOF!

575
00:50:11,996 --> 00:50:14,214
What is he doing?

576
00:50:14,249 --> 00:50:16,459
The bird is calling
to her babies.

577
00:50:16,494 --> 00:50:19,886
Her babies!

578
00:50:19,921 --> 00:50:23,133
Kevin is a... girl?

579
00:50:24,259 --> 00:50:26,970
Her house is over there,
on those twisty rocks.

580
00:50:27,262 --> 00:50:31,433
She's been gathering food for her
babies and must get back to them.

581
00:50:31,468 --> 00:50:34,519
Wait, Kevin is just leaving.

582
00:50:36,229 --> 00:50:39,614
But you promised
to protect her.

583
00:50:39,649 --> 00:50:42,819
Her babies need her. We gotta
make sure they're together.

584
00:50:42,854 --> 00:50:45,864
Sorry, Russell. We've
lost enough time already.

585
00:50:46,906 --> 00:50:48,992
Yeah...

586
00:50:55,498 --> 00:50:58,967
It was her favorite chocolate.

587
00:50:59,002 --> 00:51:04,007
Because you sent her
away, there's more for you.

588
00:51:05,884 --> 00:51:08,803
Kevin?

589
00:51:26,863 --> 00:51:29,324
Where's the bird? You
said you had the bird!

590
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:31,510
Oh, yes, oh, yes.
If I had said that,

591
00:51:31,545 --> 00:51:33,661
I can see how you
would think that.

592
00:51:33,696 --> 00:51:34,787
Where is it?

593
00:51:34,829 --> 00:51:42,045
Oh, tomorrow. Come back tomorrow and
then I will again have the bird. Yes.

594
00:51:42,378 --> 00:51:46,173
You lost it. why do I not
have a surprised feeling?

595
00:51:46,208 --> 00:51:50,028
Well, at least you now
have led us to the small

596
00:51:50,063 --> 00:51:53,848
mailman and to the one
that smells as prunes.

597
00:51:53,932 --> 00:51:56,726
The master will be most
pleased we have found them.

598
00:51:56,761 --> 00:51:58,394
He will ask them
many questions. Come.

599
00:51:58,429 --> 00:52:01,231
Wait! We're not
going with you.

600
00:52:01,266 --> 00:52:02,857
We're going to the fall.

601
00:52:04,859 --> 00:52:07,111
Get away from me!

602
00:53:05,962 --> 00:53:07,213
Down!

603
00:53:15,638 --> 00:53:18,349
You came here... in that?

604
00:53:18,384 --> 00:53:19,767
Yeah.

605
00:53:20,643 --> 00:53:24,605
In a house? A floating house?

606
00:53:32,071 --> 00:53:35,950
That is the darnest
thing I've ever seen!

607
00:53:35,985 --> 00:53:38,960
You're not after
my bird, are you?

608
00:53:38,995 --> 00:53:43,374
But if you need to borrow a cup
of sugar, I'd be happy to oblige!

609
00:53:47,545 --> 00:53:50,047
Well, this is all
a misunderstanding.

610
00:53:50,082 --> 00:53:52,098
My dogs made a mistake.

611
00:53:52,133 --> 00:53:55,136
Wait. Are you Charles Muntz?

612
00:53:55,171 --> 00:53:58,062
Well... yes.

613
00:53:58,097 --> 00:54:00,203
The Charles Muntz?

614
00:54:00,238 --> 00:54:02,310
Adventure's out there!

615
00:54:02,345 --> 00:54:04,068
It's really him!

616
00:54:04,103 --> 00:54:06,314
That's Charles Muntz!

617
00:54:06,349 --> 00:54:07,447
It is?

618
00:54:07,482 --> 00:54:09,275
Who's Charles Muntz?

619
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:10,324
Him!

620
00:54:10,359 --> 00:54:14,447
Carl Fredricksen. My wife and
I, we were your biggest fans.

621
00:54:14,482 --> 00:54:18,743
Oh, well, you're a
man of good taste.

622
00:54:18,993 --> 00:54:21,996
Now you must be tired. Hungry?

623
00:54:22,246 --> 00:54:25,958
Atention, everyone! These
people are no longer intruders.

624
00:54:25,993 --> 00:54:27,752
They are our guests.

625
00:54:27,787 --> 00:54:29,635
Yeah!

626
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:34,133
All right! I like
you temporarily.

627
00:54:34,926 --> 00:54:38,227
I will not bite you.

628
00:54:38,262 --> 00:54:41,182
The small mailman
smells like chocolate!

629
00:54:41,217 --> 00:54:43,524
I'm sorry about the dogs,

630
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:46,068
I hope they weren't
too... rough on you.

631
00:54:46,103 --> 00:54:51,359
Go ahead and pull your
airship right next to mine.

632
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:59,242
We are not actually going inside
the "Spirit of Adventure" itself?

633
00:54:59,277 --> 00:55:02,370
Oh, would you like to?

634
00:55:02,405 --> 00:55:04,956
Would I?

635
00:55:05,331 --> 00:55:07,937
Wait up, mr. Muntz!

636
00:55:07,972 --> 00:55:10,509
Jiminy Cricket!

637
00:55:10,544 --> 00:55:12,678
- Not you!
- What do we do with Dug?

638
00:55:12,713 --> 00:55:16,259
He lost the bird. Put him
in "the cone of shame".

639
00:55:19,595 --> 00:55:23,975
I do not like "the
cone of shame".

640
00:55:25,434 --> 00:55:28,312
Most of the collection is housed
in the world's top museums:

641
00:55:28,347 --> 00:55:30,696
New York, Mnich, London.

642
00:55:30,731 --> 00:55:33,359
Of course, I kept
the best for myself.

643
00:55:33,394 --> 00:55:36,150
Did you ever. Look at that!

644
00:55:36,185 --> 00:55:38,871
Oh, yes. The Arseloterium.

645
00:55:38,906 --> 00:55:41,742
The beast charged while
I was brushing my teeth.

646
00:55:41,777 --> 00:55:42,952
I used my shaving
kit to bring it down.

647
00:55:43,077 --> 00:55:46,587
Oh, yeah, now, surprise me.

648
00:55:46,622 --> 00:55:48,958
The only way to get it out
of Ethiopia at the time was

649
00:55:48,993 --> 00:55:51,252
to have it declared
technical weapon.

650
00:55:53,254 --> 00:55:55,923
Oh, my Gosh! The giant
Somalian Labradodis!

651
00:55:55,958 --> 00:55:58,380
Oh, you recognize
it? I'm impressed!

652
00:55:58,415 --> 00:56:00,803
There's an interesting
story there.

653
00:56:00,838 --> 00:56:03,135
Excellent choice.

654
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:05,433
I found it on safari,

655
00:56:05,468 --> 00:56:07,066
with Roosevelt.

656
00:56:07,101 --> 00:56:10,980
He and I fell into a habit of
playing Gin Rummy in the evenings

657
00:56:11,015 --> 00:56:13,249
and did he cheat!

658
00:56:13,284 --> 00:56:15,484
He was horrible.

659
00:56:17,862 --> 00:56:19,363
Master, dinner is ready.

660
00:56:19,398 --> 00:56:20,830
Oh, dear, broken translator.

661
00:56:20,865 --> 00:56:24,702
I think it's that
loose wire again.

662
00:56:24,827 --> 00:56:26,871
- There you go, big fellow.
- Thank you, master.

663
00:56:26,906 --> 00:56:30,249
I liked his other voice.

664
00:56:30,332 --> 00:56:32,418
Well, dinner is served.

665
00:56:32,453 --> 00:56:33,961
Right this way.

666
00:56:34,128 --> 00:56:37,972
So, how are
things States side?

667
00:56:38,007 --> 00:56:41,093
Almost tempted to
go back a few times.

668
00:56:41,886 --> 00:56:44,617
But I have
unfinished work here.

669
00:56:44,652 --> 00:56:47,314
Please! I hope you're hungry.

670
00:56:47,349 --> 00:56:51,854
Because Epsilon is the
finest chef I've ever had.

671
00:56:57,443 --> 00:56:59,653
Epsilon, you've done it again!

672
00:56:59,688 --> 00:57:00,696
Yeah!

673
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:04,331
Hey! Hey!

674
00:57:04,366 --> 00:57:07,953
My Ellie would have
loved all these.

675
00:57:07,995 --> 00:57:10,435
You know, because of
you she had this dream

676
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:13,069
to come down here
and live by the fall.

677
00:57:13,104 --> 00:57:15,634
I'm honored. And
now you've made it.

678
00:57:15,669 --> 00:57:18,422
You sure we're not a
bother? I'd hate to impose.

679
00:57:18,457 --> 00:57:20,758
No, no, it's a
pleasure to have guests.

680
00:57:20,793 --> 00:57:22,426
A real treat.

681
00:57:22,461 --> 00:57:23,684
Treat?

682
00:57:23,719 --> 00:57:25,930
Where's my treat?
I want my treat!

683
00:57:26,013 --> 00:57:28,606
Hey!

684
00:57:28,641 --> 00:57:30,100
I shouldn't have
used that word.

685
00:57:30,135 --> 00:57:32,443
Having guests is a delight!

686
00:57:32,478 --> 00:57:37,274
More often I get thieves trying
to steal what is rightfully mine.

687
00:57:37,309 --> 00:57:38,484
No...

688
00:57:40,819 --> 00:57:43,697
They called me
a fraud, those...

689
00:57:44,782 --> 00:57:49,161
But once I bring back this
creature, my name will be cleared.

690
00:57:49,203 --> 00:57:52,581
Beautiful, isn't it?

691
00:57:55,292 --> 00:57:57,628
Oh, I've spent a
lifetime tracking it.

692
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:02,299
Sometimes, years go by

693
00:58:02,334 --> 00:58:04,183
between seeings.

694
00:58:04,218 --> 00:58:09,265
I've tried to smoke it out of
that death land where it lives.

695
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:11,607
Can't go in after it.

696
00:58:11,642 --> 00:58:14,562
Once in, there's no way out.

697
00:58:14,597 --> 00:58:17,863
I lost so many dogs.

698
00:58:17,898 --> 00:58:23,779
Here they come tnose bandits who
think the bird is theirs to take!

699
00:58:27,658 --> 00:58:31,578
is a very dangerous place.

700
00:58:31,787 --> 00:58:36,548
Hey, that looks like Kevin!

701
00:58:36,583 --> 00:58:39,586
- Kevin?
- Yeah, that's my new giant pet bird!

702
00:58:39,621 --> 00:58:41,505
I trained it to follow us.

703
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:43,847
Follow you?

704
00:58:43,882 --> 00:58:45,905
Impossible. How?

705
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:47,956
She likes chocolate.

706
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:49,937
- Chocolate?
- Yeah.

707
00:58:49,972 --> 00:58:51,348
I gave her some of my chocolate.
She goes wild about it.

708
00:58:51,383 --> 00:58:54,160
But it ran off.

709
00:58:54,195 --> 00:58:56,937
Let's go now.

710
00:58:59,857 --> 00:59:03,409
You know, Carl...

711
00:59:03,444 --> 00:59:07,031
these people who
pass through here

712
00:59:11,869 --> 00:59:14,538
A surveyor making a map...

713
00:59:14,955 --> 00:59:18,917
a botanist
cataloguing plants...

714
00:59:20,502 --> 00:59:26,717
an old man taking his
house to Paradise Falls.

715
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:37,853
That's the best one yet, I
can't wait to hear how it ends.

716
00:59:46,361 --> 00:59:50,407
Well, it's been a wonderful
evening, but we'd better be going.

717
00:59:50,442 --> 00:59:52,416
You're not leaving.

718
00:59:52,451 --> 00:59:55,913
We don't want to take
advantage of your hospitality.

719
00:59:55,948 --> 00:59:57,171
Come on, Russell.

720
00:59:57,206 --> 00:59:59,208
But we haven't even
had dessert yet.

721
00:59:59,243 --> 01:00:01,877
Oh, the boy is right.

722
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:03,510
You haven't had dessert.

723
01:00:03,545 --> 01:00:07,090
Epsilon here makes a
delicious cherries jubilee.

724
01:00:08,467 --> 01:00:11,365
You really must
stay! I insist!

725
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:14,264
We have so much
more to talk about!

726
01:00:18,644 --> 01:00:19,895
Kevin?

727
01:00:26,777 --> 01:00:29,530
It's near.

728
01:00:30,322 --> 01:00:32,491
Get them!

729
01:00:34,159 --> 01:00:36,599
- Hurry!
- Kevin!

730
01:00:36,634 --> 01:00:39,039
Hurry! Dogs! Hurry!

731
01:00:39,873 --> 01:00:43,126
Master! Over here!

732
01:00:43,161 --> 01:00:46,713
Here!

733
01:00:58,976 --> 01:01:01,895
Go on, master!

734
01:01:22,583 --> 01:01:25,711
Left!

735
01:01:30,841 --> 01:01:31,967
Russell!

736
01:01:37,347 --> 01:01:38,390
Get back!

737
01:01:41,727 --> 01:01:45,022
Go on, master! I
will stop the dogs!

738
01:01:45,981 --> 01:01:47,941
Stop, you, dogs!

739
01:02:15,552 --> 01:02:18,764
Help!

740
01:02:25,812 --> 01:02:28,148
Give me your hand!

741
01:02:38,825 --> 01:02:43,497
Hang on to Kevin!

742
01:03:12,067 --> 01:03:15,779
Kevin!

743
01:03:37,342 --> 01:03:39,636
No, no, no. Kevin...

744
01:03:39,761 --> 01:03:41,478
Stay down.

745
01:03:41,513 --> 01:03:44,140
She's hurt real bad.

746
01:03:44,182 --> 01:03:46,643
Can't we help her get home?

747
01:03:57,112 --> 01:04:00,824
All right. But we gotta hurry.

748
01:04:06,329 --> 01:04:08,964
- You lost them?
- No, it was Dug.

749
01:04:08,999 --> 01:04:14,588
Yeah, he's with them.
he helped them escape!

750
01:04:14,623 --> 01:04:17,507
Wait. Wait a minute.

751
01:04:17,549 --> 01:04:18,675
Dug.

752
01:04:24,639 --> 01:04:27,892
- See anything?
- No, my pack is not following us.

753
01:04:27,927 --> 01:04:29,603
Boy, they are dumb!

754
01:04:29,638 --> 01:04:32,529
This is crazy.

755
01:04:32,564 --> 01:04:35,233
I finally meet my chidlhood
hero and he's trying to kill us.

756
01:04:35,268 --> 01:04:36,693
- What a joke.
- Hey, I know a joke!

757
01:04:36,901 --> 01:04:38,577
A squirrel walks up
up to a tree and says:

758
01:04:38,612 --> 01:04:42,240
"I forgot to store acorns
for winter and now I am dead".

759
01:04:42,616 --> 01:04:45,076
It is funny because
the squirrel gets dead.

760
01:04:46,119 --> 01:04:48,726
Careful, Russell.

761
01:04:48,761 --> 01:04:51,333
You ok, Kevin?

762
01:04:55,670 --> 01:04:58,597
You know what,
mr. Fredricksen?

763
01:04:58,632 --> 01:05:01,801
The wilderness isn't
quite what I expected.

764
01:05:01,836 --> 01:05:03,762
Yeah? How so?

765
01:05:03,928 --> 01:05:06,313
It's kind of... wild.

766
01:05:06,348 --> 01:05:09,559
I mean, it's not how they
made it sound in my book.

767
01:05:09,594 --> 01:05:11,860
Get used to that, kid.

768
01:05:11,895 --> 01:05:14,126
My dad made it sound so easy.

769
01:05:14,161 --> 01:05:16,323
He is really good at camping,

770
01:05:16,358 --> 01:05:19,486
and how to make fire
from rocks and stuff...

771
01:05:19,521 --> 01:05:22,944
He used to come to all
my squad lodge meetings.

772
01:05:22,979 --> 01:05:26,195
And afterwards, we go
get icecream that fattens.

773
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:29,412
I always get chocolate
and he gets butter brickle.

774
01:05:29,447 --> 01:05:32,422
Then we sit on this
one curve, right outside

775
01:05:32,457 --> 01:05:36,169
and I'll count all the blue cars
and he counts all the red ones

776
01:05:36,204 --> 01:05:42,092
and whoever gets
the most wins.

777
01:05:43,176 --> 01:05:46,700
I like that curve.

778
01:05:46,735 --> 01:05:50,190
It might sound boring,

779
01:05:50,225 --> 01:05:54,229
but I think the boring stuff is
the stuff I remember the most.

780
01:06:01,945 --> 01:06:05,573
Look, there it is!

781
01:06:06,032 --> 01:06:09,119
Hold on, Russell, stand still.

782
01:06:18,628 --> 01:06:22,298
Look at that bird go! Wait
up, you overgrown chicken!

783
01:06:23,758 --> 01:06:26,719
That's it! Go, Kevin!
Go find your babies!

784
01:06:31,558 --> 01:06:34,686
Run, Kevin, run!

785
01:06:35,353 --> 01:06:37,605
Oh, no!

786
01:06:41,734 --> 01:06:45,488
Russell, d-mi cuitul tu!

787
01:06:45,947 --> 01:06:48,908
Get away from my bird!

788
01:07:14,183 --> 01:07:16,269
No!

789
01:07:22,275 --> 01:07:24,611
No!

790
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:33,870
Careful, I want it in good
shape for my retirement.

791
01:07:35,163 --> 01:07:37,332
Let it go!

792
01:07:37,373 --> 01:07:39,250
Stop!

793
01:07:42,587 --> 01:07:45,131
Kevin!

794
01:07:57,644 --> 01:08:01,105
You gave away Kevin.

795
01:08:01,147 --> 01:08:05,443
You just... gave her away.

796
01:08:05,485 --> 01:08:09,072
This is none of my concern.

797
01:08:09,107 --> 01:08:12,659
I didn't ask for any of these!

798
01:08:15,286 --> 01:08:18,059
Master, it's all right.

799
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:20,798
I am not your master!

800
01:08:20,833 --> 01:08:24,128
If you hadn't shown up, none
of these would have happened.

801
01:08:24,163 --> 01:08:26,881
Bad dog, bad dog!

802
01:08:35,139 --> 01:08:37,565
Whether you assist me or not,

803
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:41,187
I am going to Paradise
Falls, if it kills me!

804
01:09:53,718 --> 01:09:55,678
Here.

805
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:57,972
I don't want this anymore.

806
01:13:37,775 --> 01:13:40,986
Russell?

807
01:13:42,029 --> 01:13:46,450
- Russell!
- I'm gonna help Kevin

808
01:13:46,485 --> 01:13:49,345
even if you won't!

809
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:52,206
No, Russell, no!

810
01:15:04,528 --> 01:15:05,779
Russell?

811
01:15:09,283 --> 01:15:12,244
I was hiding under your
porch because I love you.

812
01:15:12,279 --> 01:15:13,877
Can I stay?

813
01:15:13,912 --> 01:15:16,165
Can you stay? Well,
you're my dog, aren't you?

814
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:17,767
And I'm your master.

815
01:15:17,802 --> 01:15:19,299
You're my master?

816
01:15:19,334 --> 01:15:22,087
- Oh, boy!
- Good boy, Dug!

817
01:15:22,122 --> 01:15:24,089
You're a good boy!

818
01:15:49,781 --> 01:15:50,824
Yes!

819
01:15:52,701 --> 01:15:54,870
Don't worry, Kevin,
I'll save you.

820
01:16:03,712 --> 01:16:05,762
And they wouldn't believe me.

821
01:16:05,797 --> 01:16:08,717
Just wait till they
get a look at you!

822
01:16:08,752 --> 01:16:09,600
Master.

823
01:16:09,635 --> 01:16:12,721
The small mailman
has returned.

824
01:16:12,756 --> 01:16:14,598
What?

825
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:16,350
Let me go!

826
01:16:16,391 --> 01:16:19,186
Where is your elderly friend?

827
01:16:19,269 --> 01:16:23,280
He's not my friend anymore.

828
01:16:23,315 --> 01:16:27,069
If you're here, Fredricksen
can't be far behind.

829
01:16:27,110 --> 01:16:30,447
Where are you keeping Kevin?

830
01:16:30,572 --> 01:16:33,040
Let me go!

831
01:16:33,075 --> 01:16:35,292
Scream all you
want, small mailman.

832
01:16:35,327 --> 01:16:37,628
None of your mailmen
friends can hear you.

833
01:16:37,663 --> 01:16:43,669
I will unleash all my
wilderness explorer training!

834
01:16:44,586 --> 01:16:47,339
Alfa, Fredricksen
is coming back!

835
01:16:47,374 --> 01:16:49,681
Guard that bird.

836
01:16:49,716 --> 01:16:51,927
If you see the old man,
you know what to do.

837
01:16:51,969 --> 01:16:54,137
Where are you going? I'm
not finished with you!

838
01:16:54,172 --> 01:16:55,764
Nice talking with you.

839
01:17:01,395 --> 01:17:04,564
Where are you, Fredricksen?

840
01:17:18,704 --> 01:17:21,102
Help!

841
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:23,500
Russell!

842
01:17:36,054 --> 01:17:39,766
- Dle Fredricksen!
- Dug, bring her over!

843
01:17:39,850 --> 01:17:43,019
You came back for
Kevin! Let's go get her!

844
01:17:43,054 --> 01:17:45,237
I'm getting Kevin.
You stay here.

845
01:17:45,272 --> 01:17:48,775
- But I wanna help!
- I don't want your help.

846
01:17:48,810 --> 01:17:51,695
I want you safe.

847
01:17:57,033 --> 01:17:58,827
How do we get pass these dogs?

848
01:17:58,862 --> 01:18:01,204
Point!

849
01:18:11,423 --> 01:18:12,466
Kevin!

850
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:15,892
Don't worry, Kevin.
We are on our way.

851
01:18:15,927 --> 01:18:19,473
No one should be enterring
through these doors.

852
01:18:19,508 --> 01:18:22,893
Guard well that
bird, my minions.

853
01:18:22,928 --> 01:18:26,313
What do we do now, Dug?

854
01:18:36,823 --> 01:18:40,327
Who wants the ball?

855
01:18:40,362 --> 01:18:42,496
Me, me, me!

856
01:18:45,707 --> 01:18:47,459
Go get it!

857
01:18:49,628 --> 01:18:54,049
I got it!

858
01:18:57,260 --> 01:19:00,680
I'm sorry, Kevin. Let's
get you out of here.

859
01:19:01,431 --> 01:19:03,141
- Master, he's gone.
- What's going on?

860
01:19:03,892 --> 01:19:05,644
- He's got the bird!
- He ran off!

861
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:07,604
Calm down! One at the time!

862
01:19:11,566 --> 01:19:14,694
I want to... help!

863
01:19:28,166 --> 01:19:34,798
Does anybody know
where they are?

864
01:19:44,724 --> 01:19:49,813
Rais leaders! Bring
down that house!

865
01:19:53,566 --> 01:19:56,993
Raid leader! Checking in!

866
01:19:57,028 --> 01:20:01,741
- Raid two, checking in.
- Raid three, checking in.

867
01:20:01,783 --> 01:20:05,161
Target sighted.

868
01:20:11,710 --> 01:20:14,796
Come on, Kevin.

869
01:20:27,434 --> 01:20:31,521
Hi.

870
01:20:55,754 --> 01:20:59,424
Any last words, Fredricksen?

871
01:20:59,459 --> 01:21:02,010
Come on, spit it out!

872
01:21:02,045 --> 01:21:04,571
Come on!

873
01:21:04,606 --> 01:21:07,063
Enough!

874
01:21:07,098 --> 01:21:10,643
You cannot leave
this place alive!

875
01:21:10,678 --> 01:21:14,230
You're dead!

876
01:21:37,462 --> 01:21:40,965
Come on, Kevin.

877
01:21:58,983 --> 01:22:02,278
I'll have plenty of enjoyment
for what I'm about to do to you.

878
01:22:08,493 --> 01:22:11,955
He wears the cone of shame!

879
01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:16,167
Not just continue
sitting! Atack!

880
01:22:19,128 --> 01:22:22,173
No! No! Stop your laughing!

881
01:22:22,208 --> 01:22:25,385
Listen, you, dog, sit!

882
01:22:25,426 --> 01:22:28,186
Yes, Alfa.

883
01:22:28,221 --> 01:22:32,433
Alfa? I am not
Alfa, he is... Oh!

884
01:22:32,475 --> 01:22:35,395
I can't do it.

885
01:22:37,313 --> 01:22:41,526
Russell...

886
01:22:42,735 --> 01:22:45,154
You leave mr.
Fredricksen alone!

01:23:02,171 --> 01:23:05,133
- Hey! Squirrel!
- Squrrel? Where?

888
01:23:11,180 --> 01:23:16,102
I hate squirrels!

01:23:33,870 --> 01:23:36,164
- Dug!
- Master!

890
01:23:36,372 --> 01:23:39,542

891
01:23:39,577 --> 01:23:42,920
Let's go!

01:23:45,590 --> 01:23:48,989
Mr. Fredricksen!

893
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:52,388
Come on, Kevin.

894
01:24:03,775 --> 01:24:08,029
No!

895
01:24:19,791 --> 01:24:22,710
Russell, get out of there!

896
01:24:25,755 --> 01:24:28,466
Leave them alone!

897
01:24:42,271 --> 01:24:46,192

Don't jerk around
so much, kid.

901
01:25:20,017 --> 01:25:22,478
Easy, Russell.

902
01:25:23,437 --> 01:25:25,815
Oh, I am ready
to not be up high.

903
01:25:49,171 --> 01:25:52,049
Sorry about your
house, mr. Fredricksen.

904
01:25:53,759 --> 01:25:57,513
You know... It's just a house.

905
01:26:04,562 --> 01:26:07,690
Look at you! You're so soft!

906
01:26:10,943 --> 01:26:14,113
I wish I could keep one.

907
01:26:16,824 --> 01:26:19,869
Where is my cane?
I just had it here.

908
01:26:28,127 --> 01:26:31,339
You know what? Keep them. A
little gift from me to you.

909
01:26:31,374 --> 01:26:34,300
Bye, Kevin!
