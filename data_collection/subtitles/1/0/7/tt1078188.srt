1
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:54,680
How do you feel?

2
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,320
Oh, I don't know.
Just like I'm having a dream.

3
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,155
Well, you're not, kiddo.

4
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,331
They... They said I could
choose me own name.

5
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,597
That's right.

6
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:13,366
- Any name.
- You got one?

7
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,169
I can't...

8
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,833
I can't make up me mind.

9
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,378
Why don't you ask me
what's in the bag?

10
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:22,341
What's in the bag?

11
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,349
It's funny you should ask.

12
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:39,695
Terry.

13
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:47,805
- Have a look at what they're called.
- Terry.

14
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:54,412
Kind of appropriate, don't you think?

15
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:13,029
I don't...

16
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:14,464
You don't know what to say?

17
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,001
Say thank you.

18
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,003
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

19
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:23,365
Thank you.

20
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,151
- All right.
- All right.

21
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,759
Now...

22
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:44,662
As you know,

23
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,323
There are certain conditions
that have gotten your release.

24
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:48,094
I do.

25
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,567
There's quite a few, in fact, so we've...

26
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:50,796
Jack.

27
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,401
What?

28
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:54,667
That's the name...
That's the name I want.

29
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,732
Okay.

30
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,439
Jack.

31
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,117
Well, that's the first
thing taken care of.

32
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,123
So what are you thinking?

33
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:52,188
Don't worry.

34
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:53,698
The longer you spend here,

35
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:56,530
the smaller it's going
to seem, I promise.

36
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:03,165
Yeah, lots of students,
plenty of new faces,

37
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,336
which will work out pretty well
in your favor.

38
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,742
Mmm.

39
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:08,571
McDonald's.

40
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,106
Mm?

41
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:13,516
Oh, well,

42
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,384
at least we know what
we're having for dinner.

43
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:17,684
Hi.

44
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,281
Hi, Miss Woolly.

45
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,986
This is my nephew Jack.
Jack, Miss Woolly.

46
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,153
Come in, come in.

47
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,122
Sorry about the mess.

48
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:29,100
- And it's Kelly, by the way.
- Kelly.

49
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:32,763
It's just that I'm on nights this week,
so I'm actually not long out of bed.

50
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,199
- Tea?
- No, thank you.

51
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,605
Coffee?

52
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:38,508
Tomorrow morning,
I'll show you where everything is...

53
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:41,138
the washing machine,
the dryer, whatever.

54
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,442
You like your room, right?

55
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:44,608
- Absolutely, yeah.
- Good, I'm glad.

56
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,413
It's small, but it's clean.

57
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:47,953
- Am I wrong?
- Uh-uh.

58
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,147
Functional,

59
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,122
and you've got
the portable telly in there,

60
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,021
although don't try getting ITV.

61
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:55,151
It just won't pick up
for some reason or other.

62
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,696
Anyway...

63
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,426
Sorry. Did you say
you wanted a coffee or not?

64
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:04,094
- Uh.
- Mmm.

65
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:07,264
So, tomorrow we go to the bank

66
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,035
and we open up
an account for you, okay?

67
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:10,302
Because the more forms you fill in,

68
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:11,741
the more real your name
is going to become.

69
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:13,740
Okay.

70
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:16,641
What else do you want to do?

71
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:19,014
Uh,

72
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,484
well, what else can we do?

73
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:22,180
Whatever we want.

74
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,314
In two weeks time,
you start work proper,

75
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:28,156
so you need to experience
as much as you can before then.

76
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:30,695
Of course, your history
has to become second nature,

77
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:33,027
so I'm going to be going
over it and over it

78
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:34,293
- and getting it.
- Yeah.

79
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,130
I was wondering
if m-maybe at some stage

80
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:37,396
we could take a trip.

81
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,630
To where?

82
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:39,933
See Philip's grave.

83
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:49,780
Think we could do that?

84
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:53,478
Let me...

85
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:59,114
Terry, no, if we can't, it's fine.
Seriously, it's fine.

86
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,457
Just let me think about it, okay?

87
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,326
I'm not saying we can't go.

88
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,323
Right. Yeah, right.

89
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,534
Newton.

90
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,442
What's that?

91
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:23,880
It's where I'm from.

92
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,850
What's your name?

93
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,317
My name's Jack Burridge.

94
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,821
And why are you here, Jack?

95
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:43,495
Now, you got two numbers
in your address book...

96
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,059
mine and P.S.

97
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,537
That's for Protection Squad.

98
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,164
Okay? That's a special number.

99
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,708
You call them,
and they'll come running.

100
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,368
- Oh.
- All right?

101
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:54,208
Now, just for tonight,
there's two policemen.

102
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,147
Just go there. Can you see them?

103
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:58,478
Yeah?

104
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,246
- Yeah.
- Okay.

105
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,981
How do you feel?

106
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:06,218
This is as bad as it's going to get.

107
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:08,157
All right?

108
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:10,218
Okay. Come here.

109
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:13,164
You're going to be fine.

110
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:14,529
Yeah?

111
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:42,054
"Putting it into his pocket,
he turned back the way he'd come

112
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:43,383
"and went searching for home.

113
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,754
But It was evening now,
and growing dark."

114
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,918
Then what did he
find when he got to the...

115
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,188
A butterfly.

116
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,696
I don't see any hands.

117
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,391
A butterfly.

118
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:54,899
Butterfly pendant, good.

119
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:57,265
Okay, so who's going to continue?

120
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:00,068
Mr. Wilson?

121
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,732
Where's your book?

122
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:05,106
How difficult can it be to remember...

123
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:06,405
I'm sorry.

124
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:07,639
I take it your homework's done?

125
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:10,679
I forgot my copy.

126
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:14,152
Sara, you continue.

127
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,154
"He wanted to prove
to his newfound friend

128
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,951
"that by obtaining the pendant,

129
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:21,016
he could be trusted
with whatever task was put before him."

130
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:22,526
Hey, spastic!

131
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,891
Hey, spastic, why is
your face always dirty?

132
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,058
And his clothes.

133
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:29,260
Yeah, and your clothes, mate.

134
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,030
It's because you're a spastic.

135
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:33,730
I'm joking.

136
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:35,569
Hey, stop, now.
Come here for a minute.

137
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:36,630
Why?

138
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,609
I said we're joking.
Come on, I'm teasing.

139
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:41,010
Secret, we want to tell you a secret.

140
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,454
Who's that?

141
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:00,897
Is that you, Eric?

142
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,059
Yeah.

143
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:03,897
Come down here.

144
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,267
Just a minute.

145
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:06,362
Now.

146
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,273
Your mother's sick,
so don't go near her.

147
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,337
- Sick?
- That's right.

148
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:16,506
Where is she?

149
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,982
Didn't you hear what I said?

150
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,921
Mum.

151
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:31,656
Mum, are you okay?

152
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,363
Would you like a cup of tea?

153
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:38,403
Leave me alone.

154
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,838
I had a fight, Mum.

155
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:44,398
Leave me alone. Get out.

156
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,671
Some boys, they...

157
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,645
What did I say to you?

158
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:49,237
Eric!

159
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:16,931
Hey.

160
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,746
How do you get 500 cars in a shed?

161
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,048
Put up a bingo sign.

162
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:29,450
What's your name?

163
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,285
Eric.

164
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,220
Want to see something cool?

165
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,637
Bloody hell.

166
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,502
What are you doing?
You came straight at me!

167
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:50,508
Something hit me!

168
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:54,840
What's yours?

169
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:57,542
Huh?

170
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:58,981
What's your name?

171
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:09,984
Was it guilt, do you think?

172
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:12,959
Who knows?

173
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:14,966
Or...

174
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,831
a way of saying sorry?

175
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,572
Was he sick of the world?

176
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:31,877
We should go.

177
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,816
This was a bad idea.

178
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:34,875
Why?

179
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,046
Because Philip...

180
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:40,448
How many times have we
talked about this?

181
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:43,361
Sorry.

182
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,364
Don't be sorry.

183
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,663
I made a decision to take you.

184
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:54,399
But we have to keep looking forward,
not back. Okay?

185
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:57,374
The you from then is dead as well.

186
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,478
Or am I wrong?

187
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:01,604
Jack.

188
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,648
No, no. I'm all right.

189
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:06,681
Okay.

190
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:11,345
Right, come on.

191
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:12,981
I want to go home before dark.

192
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:14,582
All right.

193
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:30,636
Drop that off.

194
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:32,643
Come back, pick up something else.

195
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:34,611
Take that thing wherever it needs to go,

196
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,908
and so on.

197
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,744
- Simple, yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

198
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,512
Absolutely.

199
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,109
Now, you'll be partnered up

200
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,519
with Chris Kelly,
who should be here but...

201
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,281
Ah, Mr. Kelly. Glad you could join us.

202
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,656
Sorry.

203
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,024
This is Jack.

204
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,728
By the way, I'm told you been
to prison a couple of times.

205
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,197
Yeah, but, I mean...

206
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,760
Listen.

207
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,605
I only bring it up to reassure you
that your secret's safe.

208
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,576
All right?

209
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,908
I believe a man
deserves a second chance.

210
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,541
I also believe in his right to privacy.

211
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,016
So, uh,

212
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:14,814
mum's the word.

213
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,252
Idiot, eh?

214
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,818
You can say it.

215
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:23,156
"Mum's the word."

216
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:24,787
He's like David Brent or someone.

217
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:25,956
Who?

218
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,931
Yeah, very funny.

219
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,695
So what were you in for?

220
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:30,996
Unless you don't want to...

221
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,504
No, no.

222
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,938
Uh, stealing cars, you know, joyriding.

223
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:38,340
Right.

224
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,775
How many stints you do?

225
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:40,903
Three.

226
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,813
Jesus.

227
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,111
Yeah, after me last,

228
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,948
me Uncle Terry suggested I make
a new start somewhere else.

229
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,453
Get away from bad influences?

230
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:51,045
Yeah.

231
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:53,182
Well, I can't guarantee
that that's what you've done.

232
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,920
- Sophie McGee.
- Present.

233
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,684
Angela Milton.

234
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:57,854
Present.

235
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,056
Stuart Thompson.

236
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:00,223
Present.

237
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:01,596
Emily Upton.

238
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:02,759
Present.

239
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,666
Eric Wilson.

240
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,671
Eric Wilson?

241
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:07,797
Swing.

242
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:09,272
Swing and shoot webs.

243
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,182
Turn green is what I'd like.

244
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,376
Green?

245
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:20,713
Yeah.

246
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:23,152
Rip some bastard who was
making me angry to bits.

247
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,690
Hello, mate.

248
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:29,923
What's up?

249
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:33,022
You both get off school?

250
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,895
Answer me, man.

251
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:36,195
Yeah.

252
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:38,863
What's your name?

253
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:42,836
Are you dumb?

254
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:44,273
You a spastic?

255
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:45,901
Your mate is spastic, mate.

256
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,380
Oh.

257
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,917
All right, now. Fuck off.

258
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,078
We're gonna have
a little word with Eric here.

259
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,348
What, are you deaf as well as dumb?

260
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,919
Ah! Fuck, my nose!

261
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:07,560
- Oh, fuck!
- Come on, lads!

262
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,554
So...

263
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:37,686
So, yeah, now, it's... it's, um...

264
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,094
it's really good.

265
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,188
And this guy I work with, he's...

266
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:41,630
Are you ready to order?

267
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,191
Yep, sure.

268
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:50,766
I'll have your tuna
and cheese, thank you.

269
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,174
Jack.

270
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:54,269
Um...

271
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,804
I can come back.

272
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:59,817
No, no, hang on. It's all right.

273
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:01,876
Take your time.

274
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:07,291
Actually, could you come back?

275
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,826
Thank you.

276
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,020
Shit.

277
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:11,824
It's okay, it is.

278
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:15,632
What is that? What's a panini?

279
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,761
It's a bread roll, toasted, flattened.

280
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:20,304
It's nice.

281
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,839
What's Mexican chicken?

282
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:23,738
Spicy.

283
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:27,842
So you were saying?

284
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:29,778
So, now, yeah, it's been
going really good.

285
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:31,372
And the guy that you're working with...

286
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,815
He's really nice.

287
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,250
I feel like I'm getting
the hang of things.

288
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,116
- Cool.
- Yeah.

289
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:39,646
Um, we do a lot of loading,
we do a lot of unloading.

290
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,987
We do a lot of driving,

291
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,086
so you know, it's not all hard work
all the time, so...

292
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:46,154
- Yeah, that's a bonus.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

293
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:50,930
By the way, um, I want to pay for this.

294
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,334
- No. No way.
- Come on.

295
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,065
I don't know what
to do with me wages.

296
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:55,299
Trust me, that'll change.

297
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:56,705
- Terry.
- Believe me.

298
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:58,208
Terry.

299
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,108
Please, now, let me. Please.

300
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,806
Well, okay.

301
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,370
- Have you decided?
- Yes.

302
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:07,176
I will have...

303
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,947
What was it? What was it again?

304
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,989
Don't fucking laugh at me.

305
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,903
Hello, Michelle?

306
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:27,404
Chris.

307
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:37,705
How you settling in, Jack?

308
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,651
Strong and silent, yeah?

309
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:44,950
Is that right?

310
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:46,820
Does that mean
you're never gonna offer

311
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,359
to take me out for a drink?

312
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:51,993
A drink?

313
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,362
My God, it speaks, yeah?

314
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,094
A drink.

315
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,670
Uh...

316
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,207
If you don't want to, that's fine.

317
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,937
I just thought...

318
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:07,569
Hey, why don't we all go out?

319
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,706
Tomorrow night, pay day.
Get the whole crew.

320
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:12,374
You could do the inviting, Michelle.

321
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,846
Give you something to do
besides sitting around on your ass.

322
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,854
Fuck you.

323
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,664
Saved you there, mate.

324
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,670
She loves you best, that girl.

325
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,763
Here.

326
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,205
But what do I know?

327
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:40,769
Maybe you're a Don Juan
underneath that mild-mannered exterior.

328
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,547
What you looking?

329
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:49,052
Jack.

330
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,385
Kick it on, bloke.

331
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,459
Jack.

332
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:02,533
Andalu.

333
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:03,932
The White Whale, mate, Michelle?

334
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:06,402
What?

335
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:17,107
Hey.

336
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:19,412
Hi, Dad.

337
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:24,115
So how's things?

338
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:25,713
Okay.

339
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:26,917
Your mother?

340
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,983
I haven't seen her.

341
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:40,866
Long time, huh?

342
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:43,100
Listen, Dad.

343
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,109
I'm kind of homeless at the moment.

344
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:46,804
- Yeah?
- And I was...

345
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:47,867
Yeah, stay here.

346
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:49,675
Is that what you were going to ask?

347
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,739
- Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah?

348
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:53,114
Stay with me.

349
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,777
There's plenty of room.

350
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:00,950
Hello.

351
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,756
Hang on. Sorry, mate.

352
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,060
There's more beers
in the fridge. Help yourself.

353
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:22,638
Just, uh, try not to get too drunk, okay?

354
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:24,807
<i>Right, and listen.</i>
<i>You keep your wits about you.</i>

355
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:26,145
<i>Don't try and keep
up with those guys.</i>

356
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:27,378
You sound worried.

357
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,181
- <i>Well, listen.</i>
- Oh, yeah?

358
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:30,949
No. No, I'm not.

359
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:32,888
I mean, you've got to start living, yeah?

360
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,823
You know, the past
doesn't equal the future.

361
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:36,224
<i>What does that mean?</i>

362
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,264
It means that you're entitled
to some happiness, Jack.

363
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:42,095
<i>So you go out.
You have a good time.</i>

364
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,930
<i>Anything you're not sure about,</i>

365
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:46,402
<i>any problems,</i>
<i>you just call me, okay?</i>

366
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:49,201
And don't pay any attention
to all that Forefront nonsense

367
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:50,434
because that's all it is.

368
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,443
Okay.

369
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:54,502
All right. Thanks, Terry.

370
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,543
All right, man.
I'll see you Wednesday, son.

371
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:57,907
<i>All right.</i>

372
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,974
All right. Bye.

373
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:08,219
So where was this?

374
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:09,920
In Birmingham.

375
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,929
Only lasted six or seven months.

376
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,430
What finished it?

377
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,056
She went bananas.

378
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:20,765
Did she? Or did it take you that long
to work out she always was?

379
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,534
So why you up here anyway?

380
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:24,768
Work. And whales.

381
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,277
Calica's going
to release them, counselor.

382
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,837
Looking after a whale.

383
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:31,507
I cannot get over how old you look.

384
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:33,516
Give me a break.

385
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:34,882
No, no. I don't mean old.

386
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:36,443
I mean...

387
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,954
grown up.

388
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,547
I'm not trying to embarrass you.

389
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:42,650
I mean, I'm the one
that looks old, right?

390
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:47,529
I will take that smirk for acquiescence.

391
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:55,901
I really despised you.

392
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:01,042
No, no.

393
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,808
No, no, no. Let me explain, me.

394
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,041
Let me...

395
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:05,879
All the shit that happened,

396
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,179
I know it wasn't your fault.

397
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:09,379
It was just shit that happens, right?

398
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:12,855
But as a kid,
the point of view you take

399
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:15,017
- is the one that's given to you...
- Your mum?

400
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:16,754
Yeah, my mum.

401
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:19,228
And I just want to tell you
that I'd like to...

402
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:21,424
now that I'm here and you're here

403
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,527
and too many fucking years
have gone by to...

404
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:27,037
Fuck, it's so corny, to...

405
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:28,504
To what? Make up for lost time?

406
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:31,605
I suppose, yeah.

407
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:34,672
What do you think?

408
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:42,316
I think it does sound fucking corny.

409
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:45,015
It does, don't it? Fucking hell.

410
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,151
No, but seriously,
nothing would make me happier, son.

411
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:51,852
I really mean that.

412
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,163
Daddy, no!

413
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,209
No! Daddy, don't let him take me!

414
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,690
Very nice.

415
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:32,431
Let me see.

416
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:36,636
Oh, very nice.

417
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:38,300
Whoever needs knocking dead, Jack,

418
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:40,241
that's what you're going to do to him.

419
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,405
- See you later.
- See ya.

420
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,608
Look at that.

421
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:46,048
Yeah.

422
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:48,244
What you think, Jack?

423
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,254
What?

424
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,846
He's got his mind on someone else.

425
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:53,215
Who's that?

426
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:54,758
The White Whale, mate.

427
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,794
You are kidding.

428
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:59,763
She's got her mind on him,
if I'm not mistaken.

429
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,391
You sure about that?

430
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:06,401
Okay.

431
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,036
Probably for the best, eh?

432
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:31,918
She's looking for you.

433
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:35,091
Fucking hell..."Where's Jack?"

434
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:37,100
- Don't bother, mate. She's gone.
- What, home?

435
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:38,362
Out to the club.

436
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:39,562
With who?

437
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:42,198
I don't know. Claire, Lucy.

438
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:44,572
Don't worry, mate.
Night's not over yet.

439
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:52,344
<i># Maybe we can make it all right #

440
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,456

00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,461

Where's Chris?

453
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:53,677
Getting the drinks in.

454
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:55,736
You all right?

455
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:57,179
Yeah.

456
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,174
You're a little bit drunk.

457
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:02,276
And?

458
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:19,331
Girls who dance like they're
good in bed never are.

459
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,567
Hey, listen, mate.

460
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,167
She a good girl is the White Whale.

461
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:28,269
Why do you call her that?

462
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:30,576
'Cause she's white
and she's big, why else?

463
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,516
No offense to her, mate,
I'd give her a tumble or three.

464
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:36,748
Seriously, she's funny,
and she's brainy, too.

465
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:42,350
I say, you want to go for it, mate,
you go for it, yeah?

466
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:44,554
Right, open your mouths.

467
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,128
What was that?

468
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:55,502
- An Elephant.
- What?

469
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:57,438
An "E."

470
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,238
An "E"?

471
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:03,646
Ah, fuck.

472
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:05,376
Oh, relax.

473
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,647
Oh, mate, I'm sorry.
I should've... Oh, shit.

474
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,517
What's his problem?

475
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:12,647
I don't know. His parole.

476
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:15,921
He's a sensitive guy, mate.
What the fuck can I say?

477
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,870
Fucking heaven tonight, isn't it? Huh?

478
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,578
Be lucky, mate.

479
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:51,488
Who's she?

480
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,360
Some bird he's been
coddling for hours.

481
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:54,693
Oh, yeah? What's her name?

482
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:00,193
Hi.

483
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:01,465
Hi.

484
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,309
You avoiding me?

485
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:08,402
No.

486
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,107
You sure?

487
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:12,843
I mean, I thought this was
our night, first of all.

488
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,010
Yeah, it is. It is, but I'm...

489
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,213
I'm kidding.

490
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:19,188
I'm kidding, relax.

491
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,132
You see Newton
playing home tomorrow?

492
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:32,794
You like the football, Jack?

493
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,635
No, not really.

494
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:37,538
Well, I'm glad you don't.

495
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:42,046
In fact, I'd go so far as to say
that I find it a turn-on.

496
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:48,811
- You okay, Jack?
- Yeah.

497
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:50,479
- You sure?
- I love you.

498
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:52,113
What?

499
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,055
Jesus. Jack, you're drunk.

500
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:57,561
No, no, I'm not, I'm not. I'm never...

501
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,223
Never felt like this before.

502
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,595
You're off your fucking head.

503
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,133
- Aren't you?
- What? No.

504
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:05,635
Um, do you want to go for a dance?

505
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:08,672
No, I don't want to dance.

506
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,038
Look, Jack, I like you. I do.

507
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:15,239
And I'd love to spend
some time with you, but not like this.

508
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,971
Jesus.

509
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:20,609
I'll see you on Monday, yeah?

510
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:26,983
What happened?

511
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:29,151
Uh, I don't know.

512
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:30,524
What the fuck?

513
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:32,062
You decide not to trundle it?

514
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,758
What? No, I thought I did...

515
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,925
Oh, yeah. Shit, shit.

516
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,695
Hey, relax.

517
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:39,703
You can talk to her later.

518
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:40,931
How you feeling?

00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:44,516
Come on, you old pervert.

551
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:47,080
Come on. Get out of here.

552
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:48,853
Hey!

553
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,524
Aah!

554
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:00,103
Hey, hey, hey!

555
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:01,570
Leave it.

556
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:03,903
Leave it, hey? Leave it.

557
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,010
Come on, Bruiser.

558
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:18,453
You looked Steven fucking Seagal, mate.

559
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:20,548
Yeah.

560
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:22,058
It's just the come-down you're feeling.

561
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:23,753
We'll drop you off first.

562
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:25,455
Get some kip.
You'll be all right in the morning.

563
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:28,556
Van Damage, hey? Ungh!

564
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:29,725
What a night.

565
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:32,133
What a fucking night!

566
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:42,645
Excuse me.

567
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:43,805
What are you doing?

568
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:45,109
Give me that.

569
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:46,946
There's nothing in there for you.

570
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:48,849
Does your father know
you're hanging 'round shops

571
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,251
- looking at...
- Fuck you.

572
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:51,686
Excuse me?

573
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,121
Fuck you.

574
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:55,056
My father's dead.

575
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:57,117
Oh. I'm sorry.

576
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:01,189
Oh.

577
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,698
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

578
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:05,833
Oh, dear.

579
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:07,165
You poor love.

580
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,301
It's all right.

581
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:12,907
Dear.

582
00:35:26,824 --> 00:35:28,655
My mum's dying.

583
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:31,256
Yeah?

584
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:33,854
Of cancer.

585
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:35,057
Well, not now.

586
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,395
She will be.

587
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,458
Right.

588
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,937
She has it.

589
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:42,165
In her tit?

590
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,231
How did you know?

591
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:47,243
Well, that's where they get it, women.

592
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:55,879
Should've got Coke.

593
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:58,444
Mmm, shit. I forgot.

594
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:00,548
My mouth's all dry.

595
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:08,922
Wanker.

596
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:13,297
Pass me that ketchup,
Jack, do you mind?

597
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:16,135
<i>And the situation is still under review.</i>

598
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:17,868
Oh, nothing like a bit of ketchup.

599
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:20,410

615
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:10,693
- No, I'll wait.
- No, you won't.

616
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:12,023
You're going in there,

617
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:13,358
you're going to talk to her, Bruiser.

618
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:14,921
- No, maybe next time.
- Maybe never.

619
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:16,830
You're going in, and that's that.

620
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,096
You're going to invite her out,
and she's going to accept.

621
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,263
I'm getting tired
of this ridiculousness.

622
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:33,916
Hi.

623
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:36,249
Hi.

624
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:47,964
Thanks.

625
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:50,023
See you.

626
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:59,966
So, uh...

627
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:06,912
So...

628
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:14,720
do you want to do something
tomorrow night?

629
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:27,764
Just like that, eh?

630
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:30,238
Yeah, that simple.

631
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,434
Who'd have thought?

632
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:32,840
I know.

633
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,377
Thought what?

634
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:36,936
That'd she'd ever
want to see you again.

635
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:38,345
Did you think that?

636
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:40,350
Give me a break, Bruiser, will you?

637
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:06,469
Would you like a lager?

638
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:11,072
Well, all the shows start at 8:30, so...

639
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:12,877
Oh.

640
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,247
God, no, I, um...

641
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:16,912
When I said a movie, I meant a DVD.

642
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:18,079
A what?

643
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:19,349
I've rented a couple.

644
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:21,357
I meant for us to watch them here.

645
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:23,325
Oh. Okay.

646
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:24,986
Is that okay? I mean...

647
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:26,222
Oh, yeah. That's fine.

648
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,325
So you'll have fun, yeah?

649
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:51,080
So...

650
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:54,147
why you been avoiding me?

651
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:57,251
I don't know.

652
00:39:57,328 --> 00:40:01,230
The "I love you" thing, was it?

653
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:04,233
- Oh, l...
- It was sweet, Jack,

654
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:06,132
but I know you didn't mean it.

655
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:10,696
No, l-l...

656
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:16,210
It's just the way you came after me...

657
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,611
Aren't I allowed?

658
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:20,445
No, hey, you are.

659
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:24,113
Of course you are. Just, uh...

660
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:28,381
Ah...

661
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:29,517
Why you?

662
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,322
Yeah.

663
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,991
Yeah, as opposed to...

664
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:37,499
Because I like you.
Isn't that reason enough?

665
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:40,264
No, it is.

666
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:41,497
But...

667
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:43,267
What?

668
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:46,104
But...

669
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:47,576
but nothing.

670
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,112
Nothing.

671
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,841
Just a bit surprised, that's just all.

672
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:52,405
But in a nice way.

673
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:54,075
Yeah.

674
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:57,416
I should hope so.

675
00:40:57,488 --> 00:40:58,853
Would you like another?

676
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:00,322
Another what?

677
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:07,730
Surprise.

678
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:05,621
What do you think I think?

679
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:08,783
That you're less than a man
or some shit like that?

680
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:11,225
Give me some credit, Jack.

681
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:18,424
I just... I just wanted...

682
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,702
What?

683
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,338
I just wanted it to be right.

684
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:30,812
And it will be.

685
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,645
Let's go watch the other film.

686
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:36,481
We'll have a drink. We'll cuddle.

687
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,317
We'll treat this as a date

688
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:41,051
where the woman
didn't put out, all right?

689
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,921
All right, Jack.

690
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:18,188
What's this?

691
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:36,140
Oh, fuck.

692
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:18,721
Oh, Jesus.

693
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,639
Hey.

694
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:44,873
What are you looking at?

695
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:49,409
You.

696
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:52,719
Why?

697
00:44:55,559 --> 00:45:00,223
Do you love me?

698
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:02,128
Hey.

699
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,359
Hey, come here.

700
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:05,334
Come here.

701
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:06,767
No, no.

702
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:08,168
It's okay.

703
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:10,763
It's okay, come here.

704
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:14,208
Jack, it's okay.

705
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:16,303
Oh, God.

706
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,540
Hey.

707
00:45:17,614 --> 00:45:20,105
It's okay.

708
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:21,617
Oh, God.

709
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:23,619
Hey.

710
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:28,286
So... how'd it go?

711
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:29,825
Good.

712
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,656
Any action?

713
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:34,095
I don't want to talk about it.

714
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:35,991
Jesus.

715
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,260
That's a yes.

716
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:39,359
Shut the fuck up.

717
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:40,630
Why not?

718
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:42,831
Transcendent, was it?

719
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:46,467
Fuck you. Eh? Sacrosanct?

720
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:49,103
Yeah. I understand.

721
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:51,847
Just tell me one thing.

722
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,075
What?

723
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:54,981
Did you get a go on her tits?

724
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:05,686
- What the hell was that?
- What?

725
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,424
Jesus, Chris, stop the van.

726
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:18,632
Aw, fuck.

727
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:20,643
Hello?

728
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:26,673
Ah, fuck!

729
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,659
Oh, God.

730
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:47,562
Let's, uh, let's see if there's
something in the boot.

731
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,505
Yeah. With this. Help me with this?

732
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:56,011
If I can.

733
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,651
Come on.

734
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,518
Come on!

735
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:35,351
Oh, sh...

736
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:39,889
She's alive!

737
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:44,621
Come on. Don't stop looking at me.

738
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,356
All right?

739
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:47,988
You okay?

740
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:49,396
You're fine.

741
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:50,524
Okay.

742
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:52,796
Give us your knife, Chris.
Give us your knife.

743
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,098
You're all right, darling.

744
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:56,799
- Here you are.
- You're okay.

745
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:03,436
Yeah, an ambulance, please.

746
00:48:03,513 --> 00:48:04,741
There's been a car accident.

747
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:07,841
Okay, now hold on to me.
Hold really tight.

748
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:11,410
Yeah, there's the driver and a little girl.

749
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:15,592
The driver.

750
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:17,149
- Hold on tight.
- Thank God.

751
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:19,058
Hold really tight.

752
00:48:19,129 --> 00:48:21,120
I'm going to set you down on here.

753
00:48:21,198 --> 00:48:23,098
I can't see in.

754
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:24,793
Just don't go, one minute.

755
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:27,029
Okay. You're all right.

756
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:28,298
Oh. shit.

757
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:30,772
Aw, shit.

758
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:34,571
Yeah, Chris. He has it, the knife.

759
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:35,771
The leather man.

760
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:37,040
For work?

761
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:38,706
Yeah, yeah.
Cut... Cutting, you know.

762
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:40,181
Box-ties, wires, whatever.

763
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,150
And that's what you used to cut it.

764
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:43,743
Yeah.

765
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:46,846
<i>The driver didn't make it.</i>

766
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,050
Right.

767
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:49,285
Radio Carol.

768
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,054
Get her over to the mother's.

769
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:55,955
I knew he wouldn't.

770
00:49:43,947 --> 00:49:46,677
Bruiser!

771
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:53,017
Weird.

772
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:56,322
Huh?

773
00:49:56,393 --> 00:49:58,554
This morning, he was alive.

774
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:01,895
That guy?

775
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:03,296
Now he's dead.

776
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:10,571
Just hard to make sense of it.

777
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,938
We should be part of it.

778
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:15,767
Jacko.

779
00:50:19,216 --> 00:50:21,184
Mmm.

780
00:50:25,288 --> 00:50:27,279
We're so fucking delicate people.

781
00:50:31,294 --> 00:50:33,592
Die so easy.

782
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:49,543
She didn't.

783
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:50,773
No. The girl?

784
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:52,747
- Yeah.
- No.

785
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:55,580
We did some serious saving today.

786
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:03,993
You're a good guy, you, Jack.

787
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:06,996
A good mate.

788
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,089
That thing that you did
for me at the party...

789
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:11,862
What? Oh. Right.

790
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:13,197
Jumping in there...

791
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:16,068
shit.

792
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:20,041
I just wanted to say if there's... if...

793
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:23,671
if there's ever anything
that you need or...

794
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:26,113
or you want to talk about, mate...

795
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:28,174
I mean it, yeah.

796
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:33,920
Cool.

797
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,158
Yeah, just wanted to, uh,

798
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:42,960
just wanted to say that.

799
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:19,795
Mate?

800
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:21,235
Yeah?

801
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:26,401
I think you're the best friend
I ever fucking had.

802
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:28,034
Me, too.

803
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:29,373
The only friend, you mean.

804
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,422
You ever get fucked by a guy?

805
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,219
What?

806
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:44,419
No.

807
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:46,086
I did.

808
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,256
Oh.

809
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:50,356
Yeah?

810
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:52,264
You remember my brother?

811
00:52:54,938 --> 00:52:57,805
Did... Did he put it right in?

812
00:52:57,874 --> 00:53:02,834
Mm-hmm, a lot of times.

813
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:07,042
Did it hurt?

814
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:09,847
What do you think?

815
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,824
Just closed my eyes.

816
00:53:14,891 --> 00:53:16,051
Hmm?

817
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:18,219
When he does it.

818
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:21,389
Just close 'em.

819
00:53:21,464 --> 00:53:24,228
And I think of a room
with hundreds of doors.

820
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:28,465
Hundreds of doors, and they're closing.

821
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:33,938
The one's furthest away first,

822
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:37,810
and then getting closer,

823
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:40,349
just closing, just banging shut.

824
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:45,817
And I think,

825
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:51,293
if I can keep from crying
until the last one shuts...

826
00:53:53,296 --> 00:53:56,322
then I won't cry at all.

827
00:54:00,337 --> 00:54:02,430
And I don't.

828
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,289
You want some beers?

829
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:27,796
Yeah.

830
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:30,059
I took a 20 from your pocket, you mind?

831
00:54:30,133 --> 00:54:31,998
Blew it on the show.

832
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:34,036
Save a couple for me, will you?

833
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,230
Where you going?

834
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:36,772
See one of my kids.

835
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,137
Who is it?

836
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:39,937
None of your business.

837
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:42,478
Somebody trying to get back
into the swing of things.

838
00:54:42,545 --> 00:54:44,012
What did he do?

839
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,445
It's none of your business, either.

840
00:54:45,515 --> 00:54:47,176
It's what he's doing now
that's important, yeah?

841
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:48,444
His present.

842
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:50,213
His past is moot.

843
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,551
Mm-hmm.

844
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:55,022
He just doesn't go out.

845
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:57,992
He doesn't seem to have any friends.

846
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:00,621
He's making no attempt to get a job.

847
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:04,224
And...

848
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:07,862
I'm just a bit worried
he's depressed, you know?

849
00:55:07,937 --> 00:55:11,065
But then I look at you,
who's doing so well.

850
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:13,200
Come on, Terry.

851
00:55:13,276 --> 00:55:15,210
No, come on, you.

852
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:20,147
You're out there saving lives,
working, got yourself a girlfriend.

853
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:21,513
How's that going?

854
00:55:21,584 --> 00:55:23,074
It's going good.

855
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,745
Had sex yet?

856
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:28,953
No, I'm sorry. I apologize.

857
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:30,287
Yes, we have.

858
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:37,022
Good.

859
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:53,613
C-Can l... Can I say something
about that, though?

860
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:56,151
Of course.

861
00:55:56,219 --> 00:56:00,053
It's just... It's just starting
to feel a little bit, um...

862
00:56:04,227 --> 00:56:06,661
dishonest, you know?

863
00:56:08,264 --> 00:56:10,357
Jesus, you really do like her, don't you?

864
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:14,401
Listen, Jack.

865
00:56:14,471 --> 00:56:17,201
The distance that you have
traveled since I first met you

866
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:20,003
is nothing short of astonishing.

867
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:21,236
It's an achievement.

868
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:22,972
I mean, you've overcome obstacles

869
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:25,674
that many if not most people
would have fallen...

870
00:56:25,915 --> 00:56:27,041
Why Philip?

871
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:34,788
Why don't you say what you want to say?

872
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:37,292
Say it.

873
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,260
He didn't kill himself.

874
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:43,291
Who killed him?

875
00:56:43,366 --> 00:56:45,596
Hmm?

876
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:48,501
I tell you, this suspicion of yours is...

877
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:49,629
Promise me.

878
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:51,105
- What, that it was suicide?
- Yeah.

879
00:56:51,174 --> 00:56:54,974
I promise. I promise you.

880
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:59,208
Philip had to come to terms
with what he did.

881
00:56:59,282 --> 00:57:03,275
Now, he took his own life
because he was never able to do that.

882
00:57:03,353 --> 00:57:04,377
You did.

883
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:09,119
You grew. You changed.

884
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:10,318
You earned the right...

885
00:57:10,393 --> 00:57:12,657
You earned the right to be Jack Burridge.

886
00:57:12,729 --> 00:57:16,665
Because that's what this is,
it's a fucking right.

887
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:20,066
And Jack Burridge has
not lied to that girl

888
00:57:20,136 --> 00:57:24,402
because Jack Burridge has
done nothing to lie about.

889
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:28,604
Do you understand me, Jack?

890
00:57:32,348 --> 00:57:34,282
Do you understand me, son?

891
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,250
There's somebody here
wants to see you, mate.

892
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,013
- Who?
- Don't know.

893
00:58:10,086 --> 00:58:12,714
Uh, by the loading bay
with Dave and Chris.

894
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:14,479
All right.

895
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:47,285
Hey, Jack. Get over here, will ya?

896
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,348
- This is Felix.
- Hi.

897
00:58:49,425 --> 00:58:50,687
From the evening news.

898
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,160
Wants to do a little piece, am I right?

899
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:55,663
- On us?
- Our daring rescue.

900
00:58:55,732 --> 00:58:58,098
Actually I'm only here
to take the photo.

901
00:58:58,167 --> 00:59:00,260
Listen, I'm not really sure...

902
00:59:00,336 --> 00:59:01,598
What?

903
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:03,536
Well, that I want my
photo taken, all right?

904
00:59:03,606 --> 00:59:04,868
Why?

905
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:06,465
Jesus, Jack, it's just a photo.

906
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,238
Where do you want him, Felix?

907
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:09,869
Beside the van will be good, yeah?

908
00:59:09,946 --> 00:59:11,106
Get the old logo in. Whatnot.

909
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:12,579
If you like.

910
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:14,378
What about the hats, Dave?

911
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:15,974
What?

912
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:17,246
Get them in, too.

913
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,651
That's a good idea.

914
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:21,212
Carol, have we got any hats in there?

915
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:22,451
What kind?

916
00:59:22,525 --> 00:59:24,686
- What do you mean "what kind"?
- Our hats.

917
00:59:24,761 --> 00:59:25,750
DV?

918
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:28,156
Well, that's the name
of the company, isn't it?

919
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:30,062
I'll have a look.

920
00:59:45,214 --> 00:59:48,012
Uh, a little to the left.

921
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:50,644
- To the left!
- They're fine.

922
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,153
Fine. They're fine where they are.

923
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:53,984
Okay, then.

924
00:59:59,629 --> 01:00:00,823
Got it.

925
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,429
That's all right, isn't it? Yeah.

926
01:00:07,503 --> 01:00:08,970
Can you cut that down a bit?

927
01:00:09,038 --> 01:00:10,767
Just the sides.

928
01:00:15,878 --> 01:00:18,278
Just don't want my old mates
to know where I am.

929
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:19,610
Your mates from back home?

930
01:00:19,682 --> 01:00:21,650
- Yeah.
- Jack, it's the evening news.

931
01:00:21,718 --> 01:00:23,777
- So?
- The Manchester evening news.

932
01:00:23,853 --> 01:00:26,048
All right.

933
01:00:26,322 --> 01:00:28,688
God, you're paranoid. You know that?

934
01:00:28,758 --> 01:00:31,386
So listen, Steve's asked if you want
to go for a game of pool tonight.

935
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:32,894
- You up for it?
- Oh, sorry, mate.

936
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:34,554
- I'm seeing Michelle.
- All right.

937
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,394
How's it going with
the White Whale anyway?

938
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:37,831
- Ah, good.
- And?

939
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,697
Prefer if you didn't call her
that anymore though.

940
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:41,760
Ah, Jackie Boy, you've got it bad.

941
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:43,863
I just don't see why
everyone has to have a name.

942
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,703
- Like Bruiser?
- Yeah.

943
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:47,333
Just the way the world works, mate.

944
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:48,672
- We've all got to have one.
- Yeah, well...

945
01:00:48,745 --> 01:00:50,576
But if Michelle's
your preference, then...

946
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,615
Michelle it shall be.

947
01:00:52,682 --> 01:00:54,547
Just don't forget
my invite to the wedding.

948
01:01:06,529 --> 01:01:09,327
Hey, hero.

949
01:01:09,399 --> 01:01:10,627
Look what I got.

950
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:15,399
Yeah. It's horrible. It's horrible.

951
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:16,904
What are you doing?

952
01:01:16,973 --> 01:01:18,668
Why'd you lower your cap like that?

953
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:19,799
Didn't <i>realize</i> I had.

954
01:01:19,876 --> 01:01:21,309
I love it.

955
01:01:21,377 --> 01:01:23,038
"Disregard for..." No wait.

956
01:01:23,112 --> 01:01:28,379
"Quick thinking and selfless disregard
for their own safety." La, la, la.

957
01:01:28,451 --> 01:01:30,919
"Heroic actions."

958
01:01:30,987 --> 01:01:33,012
You know how proud of you I am?

959
01:01:34,323 --> 01:01:35,585
No.

960
01:01:35,658 --> 01:01:38,456
Very proud.

961
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:41,463
Oh. I've got something for you.

962
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,556
Oh, yeah?

963
01:01:43,633 --> 01:01:46,466
Happy Birthday.

964
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:47,594
It ain't me...

965
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:49,831
Yeah, I know.

966
01:01:49,906 --> 01:01:52,602
It's for the ones we missed.

967
01:02:12,428 --> 01:02:14,521
Oh, my...

968
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:16,827
Could we have the bill, please?

969
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:38,978
Michelle...

970
01:02:39,055 --> 01:02:41,023
I don't know what to say.

971
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:42,682
You like it, then?

972
01:02:45,661 --> 01:02:47,219
Yeah, I love it.

973
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:49,389
And that's only the first half.

974
01:02:49,465 --> 01:02:51,660
Well, what's the second?

975
01:02:54,504 --> 01:02:56,131
All right, all right.

976
01:02:56,405 --> 01:02:57,497
- How about that?
- Very good.

977
01:02:57,573 --> 01:03:00,667
It's very good.

978
01:03:00,743 --> 01:03:02,005
Nah, let's get serious about this.

979
01:03:02,078 --> 01:03:03,568
Give me a pout.

980
01:03:03,646 --> 01:03:04,704
A pout? All right.

981
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:08,080
A fucking Page 3 pout.

982
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,648
What?

983
01:03:12,722 --> 01:03:15,623
You're fucking nuts.

984
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:19,320
Carry on, keep going,
keep going, keep going.

985
01:03:19,395 --> 01:03:21,363
Yeah.

986
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:22,488
Oh, sultry.

987
01:03:22,565 --> 01:03:23,759
Very nice.

988
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:25,323
I don't even know
what that word means.

989
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:26,561
But I know I like it.

990
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:29,366
- That's it?
- Yeah, I think so.

991
01:03:29,438 --> 01:03:31,804
Show me.

992
01:03:31,874 --> 01:03:35,241
Oh, shit.

993
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:36,437
Yeah.

994
01:03:36,512 --> 01:03:40,710
Yeah, that's it.

995
01:03:40,783 --> 01:03:43,775
And just when I was about
to start my porn routine.

996
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,127
Where are we going?

997
01:03:55,198 --> 01:03:57,462
What?

998
01:03:57,533 --> 01:03:58,659
Is this the way?

999
01:03:58,734 --> 01:04:02,693
This is our way, right?

1000
01:04:02,772 --> 01:04:04,501
We've done it loads of times, Jack.

1001
01:04:04,574 --> 01:04:06,405
And this way we're going to
save, like, an hour.

1002
01:04:06,475 --> 01:04:07,601
That's right.

1003
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:10,168
We're just taking a short cut.

1004
01:04:10,446 --> 01:04:13,438
We're not doing anyone any harm.

1005
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,746
Done this before?

1006
01:04:15,818 --> 01:04:16,876
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1007
01:04:16,953 --> 01:04:18,147
Like loads of times.

1008
01:04:25,628 --> 01:04:28,028
Fuck it. Come on, then.

1009
01:04:46,849 --> 01:04:48,578
- Oh, shit.
- What?

1010
01:04:48,651 --> 01:04:50,846
That wasn't there the last time.

1011
01:04:53,756 --> 01:04:55,724
Come on, Jack.

1012
01:04:57,193 --> 01:04:58,922
Jack, come on.

1013
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:15,601
Don't like it!

1014
01:05:15,678 --> 01:05:17,168
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

1015
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:21,914
What's next?

1016
01:05:21,984 --> 01:05:23,815
Do you want to grab some food?
I'm starving.

1017
01:05:23,886 --> 01:05:25,751
Jesus Christ, look at Bruiser.

1018
01:05:25,821 --> 01:05:28,551
Man, you are fucking green!

1019
01:05:29,992 --> 01:05:31,084
Man, you are.

1020
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,457
You're fucking green!

1021
01:05:32,528 --> 01:05:33,790
Don't fucking touch me.

1022
01:05:33,863 --> 01:05:36,058
The Bruiser!

1023
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:01,749
Jack, Kelly must know by now.

1024
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:02,916
Nah, she don't, she don't.

1025
01:06:02,992 --> 01:06:04,482
She gets in ready for work,

1026
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:05,720
- so she wouldn't know.
- Right.

1027
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:07,092
Although maybe she does,
I don't know.

1028
01:06:07,163 --> 01:06:08,994
That's three times
this week. You know that?

1029
01:06:09,065 --> 01:06:10,089
What?

1030
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:11,929
You've stayed over.

1031
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:13,400
Oh.

1032
01:06:15,571 --> 01:06:17,562
You got a problem with that?

1033
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:18,732
Not at all.

1034
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:21,402
I'm just, you know...

1035
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:23,138
Right. You're informing me.

1036
01:06:23,412 --> 01:06:25,107
Bringing the... yeah.

1037
01:06:25,181 --> 01:06:27,411
What?

1038
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:29,508
The fact to your attention.

1039
01:06:29,585 --> 01:06:32,179
Enlighten you to it.

1040
01:06:32,455 --> 01:06:34,480
Well, I appreciate it.

1041
01:06:51,073 --> 01:06:52,404
What is it?

1042
01:06:52,475 --> 01:06:54,067
A rubber johnnie.

1043
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:56,474
What's it for?

1044
01:06:56,545 --> 01:06:57,637
Are you stupid?

1045
01:06:57,713 --> 01:06:59,613
Shagging women.

1046
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:02,344
If you don't wear one,
you get a sore on your dick.

1047
01:07:02,418 --> 01:07:03,885
Want to see it?

1048
01:07:03,953 --> 01:07:06,114
- Eww.
- Exactly.

1049
01:07:07,757 --> 01:07:10,624
Try and find something to dig with.

1050
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:24,799
What about this one?

1051
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:27,308
Perfect.

1052
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:29,708
Cut the little bits off with this.

1053
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:55,836
They like the darkness
under the bridge, you see.

1054
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:57,896
Like trolls?

1055
01:07:57,973 --> 01:08:01,238
No. Where are the trolls, mate?

1056
01:08:02,845 --> 01:08:05,040
Fuck.

1057
01:08:14,056 --> 01:08:17,150
- You see it?
- Yeah.

1058
01:08:17,226 --> 01:08:20,024
You see the <i>size</i> of it?

1059
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:21,620
Shit. Grab it.

1060
01:08:21,697 --> 01:08:23,187
- What?
- Grab it!

1061
01:08:28,037 --> 01:08:30,198
Jesus.

1062
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:39,275
Bollocks.

1063
01:09:07,676 --> 01:09:09,303
Wow.

1064
01:09:09,378 --> 01:09:12,040
Yeah.

1065
01:09:12,114 --> 01:09:14,776
Why isn't it dead?

1066
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:17,011
It's not far from it now.

1067
01:09:47,249 --> 01:09:50,047
Look at that one.

1068
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:53,880
Oh, wow.

1069
01:09:53,956 --> 01:09:56,015
You want it?

1070
01:09:56,091 --> 01:09:59,151
Take it.

1071
01:09:59,228 --> 01:10:01,128
You might be alone
sometime and need it.

1072
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:03,859
You know what I mean?

1073
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,196
So I take it you're staying over tonight?

1074
01:10:12,441 --> 01:10:14,739
Huh?

1075
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:16,141
Yeah.

1076
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:18,305
I would have thought... what's this?

1077
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:20,314
No, that's cool.

1078
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:23,977
There's you.

1079
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:26,715
So cute.

1080
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:35,363
What's up, Jack?

1081
01:10:49,178 --> 01:10:53,171
Have you... Have you
slept with many blokes?

1082
01:10:55,484 --> 01:10:56,746
I don't know.

1083
01:10:56,819 --> 01:10:59,219
A few.

1084
01:10:59,288 --> 01:11:02,746
I mean, I've never slept around.

1085
01:11:02,825 --> 01:11:03,917
All right.

1086
01:11:03,993 --> 01:11:05,984
What about you?

1087
01:11:06,061 --> 01:11:08,029
Nah, I ain't slept with many girls.

1088
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:09,621
And your past?

1089
01:11:09,698 --> 01:11:11,632
- That is my past.
- No.

1090
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:15,067
I mean your past... the cars,

1091
01:11:15,137 --> 01:11:17,071
your time in prison.

1092
01:11:17,139 --> 01:11:18,333
What about it?

1093
01:11:18,407 --> 01:11:20,466
It's really over, right?

1094
01:11:20,542 --> 01:11:25,172
Of course it is.

1095
01:11:25,247 --> 01:11:26,339
Why? Why do you...

1096
01:11:26,415 --> 01:11:28,542
No, I just...

1097
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:32,386
Because I want you to say.

1098
01:11:43,098 --> 01:11:45,794
- Say what?
- Forget it.

1099
01:11:45,868 --> 01:11:49,269
I think I'm in love with you, Michelle.

1100
01:11:49,338 --> 01:11:52,171
Yeah?

1101
01:11:52,241 --> 01:11:55,802
Yeah.

1102
01:11:55,878 --> 01:11:59,336
I think I'm in love with you.

1103
01:12:10,292 --> 01:12:12,726
What was, what was
you going to say, then?

1104
01:12:12,795 --> 01:12:14,786
That's it.

1105
01:12:16,298 --> 01:12:19,961
- Wha...
- It's all right.

1106
01:12:22,237 --> 01:12:24,330
You beat me to it, you asshole.

1107
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:47,261
Oh, shit! I can't.

1108
01:12:47,329 --> 01:12:50,230
I can't fucking stay.

1109
01:12:50,299 --> 01:12:51,630
Oh, fuck.

1110
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:55,659
Kelly lost her house key. I've got to...
I've got to let her in in the morning.

1111
01:12:55,738 --> 01:12:57,672
- Oh, no.
- Shit.

1112
01:12:57,740 --> 01:13:00,368
I'll call you a taxi.

1113
01:13:00,442 --> 01:13:02,171
No, no, no. Don't worry about it.

1114
01:13:02,244 --> 01:13:04,337
There's always plenty
up on the main street.

1115
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:24,824
I tell you what.

1116
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,231
What?

1117
01:13:36,111 --> 01:13:39,478
I never thought...

1118
01:13:39,548 --> 01:13:44,383
in my life...

1119
01:13:44,453 --> 01:13:46,353
Shit.

1120
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:52,627
That I would ever say those words.

1121
01:13:52,694 --> 01:13:56,528
Or have 'em said to me.

1122
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:01,297
- Yeah.
- Do you know, do you know?

1123
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:06,537
Now I have someone.

1124
01:14:07,075 --> 01:14:10,704
A girl who makes me...

1125
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:19,380
Sometime...

1126
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:22,618
when I ain't seen ya
and then I see ya...

1127
01:14:27,396 --> 01:14:29,660
I find it hard to breathe.

1128
01:14:35,571 --> 01:14:37,971
This is getting serious, isn't it?

1129
01:14:57,493 --> 01:15:00,087
Are you fucking mad?

1130
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:02,426
No, no, no.
You can never do this.

1131
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:03,692
You understand what I'm saying?

1132
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:05,957
You can never ever do this. Never!

1133
01:15:06,034 --> 01:15:08,525
- Never?
- <i>Never, never.</i>

1134
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:11,571
<i>She would understand. I know it.</i>

1135
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:12,834
Listen, listen.

1136
01:15:12,908 --> 01:15:14,341
Her understanding's
not the issue, okay?

1137
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:15,967
Knowledge is the issue.

1138
01:15:16,044 --> 01:15:17,602
Your safety is the issue.

1139
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:20,443
Okay? Do you, do you know...

1140
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:22,245
Fuck it.

1141
01:15:22,317 --> 01:15:24,308
There's been a bounty posted
for you on the internet.

1142
01:15:24,386 --> 01:15:25,580
A what?

1143
01:15:25,654 --> 01:15:27,178
For information regarding
your whereabouts.

1144
01:15:27,256 --> 01:15:28,621
Now listen, I wasn't going to tell you.

1145
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:30,658
Am I in danger?

1146
01:15:30,726 --> 01:15:32,956
<i>No, no, no, no.
But do you now realize</i>

1147
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:36,122
there are people out there
who want you? They hate you.

1148
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:39,258
They will never let go
of what happened. Ever, ever!

1149
01:15:39,334 --> 01:15:40,528
How much is it for?

1150
01:15:40,602 --> 01:15:41,694
<i>That doesn't matter.</i>

1151
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:43,237
Terry, how much is it for?

1152
01:15:46,108 --> 01:15:47,473
20 grand.

1153
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:50,137
Oh, fuck.

1154
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:52,146
<i>But listen, you're safe.</i>

1155
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:54,307
You're safe as long as nobody knows.

1156
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:55,816
So you have to be strong.

1157
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:57,852
You have to stick by the game plan.

1158
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,717
However strongly you may feel this urge,

1159
01:15:59,788 --> 01:16:03,622
however right you may feel
it is to follow it, you can't.

1160
01:16:03,692 --> 01:16:07,651
And I want you to promise me,
Jack, that you won't.

1161
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:08,855
Now, you promise me.

1162
01:16:09,131 --> 01:16:10,598
Will you do that for me, son?

1163
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:13,726
<i>Will you promise
me that you won't?</i>

1164
01:16:16,872 --> 01:16:21,639
It's so fucking hard.

1165
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:23,678
<i>I know.</i>

1166
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:26,771
And as we heard from the recordings

1167
01:16:26,848 --> 01:16:27,974
from each boys' willingness

1168
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:31,981
to extricate himself from blame
at the expense of the other,

1169
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:34,586
both of them are to blame.

1170
01:16:34,656 --> 01:16:36,556
Both committed the act,

1171
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:38,889
though neither will
accept responsibility,

1172
01:16:38,961 --> 01:16:42,055
let alone provide a reason
for their actions.

1173
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:44,257
Though why should they?

1174
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:45,891
And if they did,

1175
01:16:45,968 --> 01:16:49,398
would it be sufficient
to explain the loss

1176
01:16:49,399 --> 01:16:52,430
of this beautiful,
this innocent child?

1177
01:16:52,507 --> 01:16:58,571
Who once, so brim-full of potential,
will now never have it realized.

1178
01:16:58,647 --> 01:17:03,209
Who has been,
in the most violent manner imaginable,

1179
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:06,652
wiped off the face of the earth.

1180
01:17:06,722 --> 01:17:09,520
What reason could be good enough?

1181
01:17:09,591 --> 01:17:10,785
None.

1182
01:17:10,859 --> 01:17:12,349
None but this.

1183
01:17:12,427 --> 01:17:13,951
That they are bad.

1184
01:17:14,229 --> 01:17:15,719
No, no other description will do.

1185
01:17:15,797 --> 01:17:17,822
That they are evil.

1186
01:17:17,899 --> 01:17:19,560
But more crucially,

1187
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:21,660
that they are dangerous.

1188
01:17:21,737 --> 01:17:24,535
And that they must...
not as punishment,

1189
01:17:24,606 --> 01:17:25,800
no, that's irrelevant

1190
01:17:25,874 --> 01:17:28,536
as is the hope of rehabilitation...

1191
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:32,239
But that they must,
for the sakes of our children,

1192
01:17:32,314 --> 01:17:34,214
all of them,

1193
01:17:34,282 --> 01:17:36,375
for their safety and well-being,

1194
01:17:36,451 --> 01:17:42,788
be sent away for as long
as is lawfully possible.

1195
01:17:42,858 --> 01:17:45,827
That's right!

1196
01:17:45,894 --> 01:17:48,624
Lock them up!

1197
01:17:48,697 --> 01:17:52,463
Amen.

1198
01:17:54,803 --> 01:17:56,327
Daddy, no!

1199
01:17:56,405 --> 01:17:58,396
No, Daddy, don't let them take me!

1200
01:17:58,473 --> 01:18:01,499
No, don't let them take me away!

1201
01:18:01,576 --> 01:18:02,838
Mommy, please!

1202
01:18:02,911 --> 01:18:05,846
No! No, Daddy!

1203
01:18:05,914 --> 01:18:07,745
Daddy, no! No!

1204
01:18:07,816 --> 01:18:10,444
This bloke should die?

1205
01:18:12,487 --> 01:18:13,647
Hmm?

1206
01:18:13,722 --> 01:18:16,589
Look at his hair.

1207
01:18:22,431 --> 01:18:25,264
Why don't you ever go out, Zeb?

1208
01:18:25,333 --> 01:18:26,891
I don't know.

1209
01:18:26,968 --> 01:18:30,631
Meet any friends since you got here?

1210
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:34,107
I'm fine, Da.

1211
01:18:34,176 --> 01:18:37,441
I don't think so.

1212
01:18:37,512 --> 01:18:40,743
You're always drinking.

1213
01:18:40,816 --> 01:18:42,408
I mean, don't get me wrong,

1214
01:18:42,484 --> 01:18:44,475
I enjoy a bit, son, but is it healthy?

1215
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:46,646
That's rhetorical, by the way.

1216
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:48,087
I know.

1217
01:18:48,156 --> 01:18:53,685
Now, I know that it's not healthy.

1218
01:18:53,762 --> 01:18:59,200
And what I'm trying
to tell you is that...

1219
01:18:59,468 --> 01:19:01,129
Fuck, I'm pissed.

1220
01:19:02,604 --> 01:19:03,571
What, that you're pissed?

1221
01:19:03,638 --> 01:19:06,368
No, no, l...

1222
01:19:06,441 --> 01:19:08,568
Thank you.

1223
01:19:08,643 --> 01:19:12,739
You should be out there getting a life.

1224
01:19:12,814 --> 01:19:15,374
Doing something.

1225
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:17,509
I'm not trying to tell you what to do,

1226
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:23,821
but I don't like seeing you
lying around night after night.

1227
01:19:23,892 --> 01:19:27,988
So do something useful
and pour me something, would ya?

1228
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:45,671
Cheers.

1229
01:19:51,086 --> 01:19:53,680
Fuck it, you're right.

1230
01:19:53,755 --> 01:19:57,088
What's that?

1231
01:19:57,359 --> 01:19:59,054
His hair is ridiculous.

1232
01:20:02,764 --> 01:20:04,493
Hmm.

1233
01:20:04,566 --> 01:20:06,966
Forget it all, son.

1234
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:10,801
You're young.

1235
01:20:10,872 --> 01:20:14,899
Plenty of time to sort yourself out
and get your act together.

1236
01:20:18,547 --> 01:20:20,071
I love you, Jack.

1237
01:20:23,752 --> 01:20:26,880
You're my greatest fucking achievement.

1238
01:20:46,541 --> 01:20:47,473
Where's Michelle?

1239
01:20:47,542 --> 01:20:49,635
She rang in sick this morning.

1240
01:20:49,711 --> 01:20:51,975
Oh.

1241
01:20:55,150 --> 01:20:57,516
All right, Michelle,

1242
01:20:57,586 --> 01:21:01,078
um, uh...

1243
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:02,653
I just heard you were sick.

1244
01:21:02,724 --> 01:21:06,057
Uh, I hope you're not feeling too bad.

1245
01:21:06,127 --> 01:21:09,494
Uh...

1246
01:21:09,564 --> 01:21:11,498
just wondering.

1247
01:21:11,566 --> 01:21:16,594
I c... I can... I can drop over
after work if you want.

1248
01:21:19,407 --> 01:21:21,102
It... It's a cold, yeah?

1249
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:26,379
Love you.

1250
01:21:50,672 --> 01:21:52,936
Michelle?

1251
01:22:05,287 --> 01:22:06,652
I don't know.

1252
01:22:06,721 --> 01:22:08,188
I think she might be at her mum's.

1253
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:09,553
<i>Well, have you rung her?</i>

1254
01:22:09,624 --> 01:22:11,854
Yeah, her phone's switched off.

1255
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:13,360
<i>Well then, how do you know</i>
<i>she's not alone?</i>

1256
01:22:13,628 --> 01:22:15,152
Because I've been out there twice.

1257
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:17,289
<i>So ring her mum.</i>

1258
01:22:17,365 --> 01:22:18,992
No. I ain't got her number, have I?

1259
01:22:19,067 --> 01:22:20,193
<i>All right, look, you know what?</i>

1260
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:21,963
<i>Claire will probably know.</i>

1261
01:22:22,037 --> 01:22:23,629
<i>Let me give her a call,</i>
<i>and I'll call you back.</i>

1262
01:22:23,705 --> 01:22:27,004
She says she ain't heard
from her in a couple of days.

1263
01:22:27,075 --> 01:22:28,906
Okay. What about boyfriends?

1264
01:22:28,977 --> 01:22:30,774
I'm her boyfriend.

1265
01:22:30,845 --> 01:22:32,244
No, ex-boyfriends.

1266
01:22:32,314 --> 01:22:33,303
Did she ever mention any...

1267
01:22:33,381 --> 01:22:35,008
No, no, no one.

1268
01:22:36,751 --> 01:22:38,309
Shit.

1269
01:22:38,386 --> 01:22:41,981
You think she's hurt.

1270
01:22:42,057 --> 01:22:43,684
- No.
- Yeah, you do.

1271
01:22:43,758 --> 01:22:46,750
Just let me think a minute.

1272
01:22:54,836 --> 01:22:57,031
Do you think I hurt her, Terry?

1273
01:22:57,105 --> 01:22:59,005
What?

1274
01:22:59,074 --> 01:23:01,872
Do you think I hurt her?

1275
01:23:01,943 --> 01:23:04,673
No. Never.

1276
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:08,609
Never, Jack.

1277
01:23:13,321 --> 01:23:15,721
I'll make some calls when I get back.

1278
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:18,623
Make sure her car hasn't been
in an accident or something.

1279
01:23:18,693 --> 01:23:20,957
In the meantime, you just...

1280
01:23:21,029 --> 01:23:22,963
Thank you.

1281
01:23:23,031 --> 01:23:25,625
- Wait and see.
- Thank you, Terry.

1282
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:26,894
Yeah.

1283
01:24:13,748 --> 01:24:14,874
Oh, fuck, fuck!

1284
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:44,908
- <i>Jack, Dave.</i>
- Hello.

1285
01:24:46,881 --> 01:24:49,008
<i>Listen, we're not going to</i>
<i>need you at work today.</i>

1286
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:50,210
Oh, why not?

1287
01:24:50,285 --> 01:24:52,082
<i>Or for the foreseeable future.</i>

1288
01:24:58,293 --> 01:24:59,954
What've I done?

1289
01:25:00,028 --> 01:25:01,154
<i>Don't come to the depot again.</i>

1290
01:25:01,229 --> 01:25:03,026
<i>Do you understand?</i>

1291
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:04,588
<i>We'll send you</i>
<i>what you're owed in wages.</i>

1292
01:25:04,666 --> 01:25:07,066
Wait. Dave, Dave? Um, uh, just...

1293
01:25:07,135 --> 01:25:08,966
<i>Goodbye, Jack.</i>

1294
01:25:12,974 --> 01:25:14,635
Oi, mate, it's Jack here.

1295
01:25:14,709 --> 01:25:18,236
Hey, um, Dave just called me.

1296
01:25:18,313 --> 01:25:20,247
Told me not to come in.

1297
01:25:20,315 --> 01:25:22,783
He obviously knows you're
not who you say you are.

1298
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:31,285
Is he wrong?

1299
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:33,827
<i>Chr- Chris?</i>

1300
01:25:33,895 --> 01:25:35,829
No, of course he's not.

1301
01:25:35,897 --> 01:25:37,194
<i>You've got to just listen to me.</i>

1302
01:25:37,265 --> 01:25:38,755
- Where's Michelle?
- <i>What?</i>

1303
01:25:38,833 --> 01:25:40,596
Is she hurt?
Have you hurt her, you fuck?

1304
01:25:40,668 --> 01:25:42,932
How could you ask me that question?

1305
01:25:43,004 --> 01:25:44,096
<i>You're a murderer, aren't you?</i>

1306
01:25:44,172 --> 01:25:45,764
- Who says?
- Everyone.

1307
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:48,604
How could we have been
so blind to allow you to...

1308
01:25:48,676 --> 01:25:50,974
- You've got to please, Chris...
- <i>No, Jack.</i>

1309
01:25:51,045 --> 01:25:52,069
<i>I'm done with you.</i>

1310
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:53,808
Chris? Chris, mate. Chris?

1311
01:26:04,225 --> 01:26:05,817
<i>Sorry I can't take your call...</i>

1312
01:26:05,894 --> 01:26:08,590
Oh, for fuck's sake, Terry!

1313
01:26:38,293 --> 01:26:39,954
Anything you want to say?

1314
01:26:42,664 --> 01:26:44,859
Do you think you're rehabilitated?

1315
01:26:44,933 --> 01:26:47,026
Do your neighbors not
have the right to know?

1316
01:27:00,715 --> 01:27:02,046
<i>Sorry I can't take
your call right now.</i>

1317
01:27:02,116 --> 01:27:03,583
Oh, fuck, Terry.

1318
01:27:03,651 --> 01:27:04,811
<i>Just leave your name and number...</i>

1319
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:06,751
Terry, Terry, Terry.
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

1320
01:27:07,755 --> 01:27:08,915
Shit.

1321
01:27:11,826 --> 01:27:14,021
No, I ain't that boy.

1322
01:27:17,599 --> 01:27:20,295
No, I ain't that boy.

1323
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:26,572
No, I ain't that boy.

1324
01:27:26,641 --> 01:27:29,667
No, I ain't that boy. I ain't that boy.

1325
01:27:29,744 --> 01:27:32,042
Fuck! Fuck!

1326
01:27:33,848 --> 01:27:35,406
I ain't that boy.

1327
01:27:36,918 --> 01:27:38,886
Please.

1328
01:27:42,323 --> 01:27:44,188
No!

1329
01:28:06,414 --> 01:28:08,006
<i>Sorry I can't take
your call right now.</i>

1330
01:28:08,082 --> 01:28:09,140
<i>Just leave your name and number,</i>

1331
01:28:09,217 --> 01:28:12,983
<i>and I'll get back to you as</i>
<i>soon as possible. Thank you. Bye.</i>

1332
01:29:10,445 --> 01:29:11,878
Aah!

1333
01:31:08,996 --> 01:31:11,988
- What you doing?
- Huh?

1334
01:31:12,066 --> 01:31:13,192
That's vandalism.

1335
01:31:13,267 --> 01:31:15,633
Have you nothing better to do?

1336
01:31:15,903 --> 01:31:18,371
What?

1337
01:31:18,439 --> 01:31:20,532
How about what you were doing earlier?

1338
01:31:20,608 --> 01:31:21,870
Excuse me?

1339
01:31:21,943 --> 01:31:24,605
Kissing and stuff. You know.
You did with...

1340
01:31:24,679 --> 01:31:26,943
You saw that?

1341
01:31:27,014 --> 01:31:29,380
You spying little shitbags.

1342
01:31:29,450 --> 01:31:30,747
Hey, watch it.

1343
01:31:30,818 --> 01:31:32,149
Don't threaten me.

1344
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:33,619
- I will if I want.
- You won't.

1345
01:31:33,688 --> 01:31:35,553
I will if I want.

1346
01:31:35,623 --> 01:31:38,183
Who the hell do you think you are?

1347
01:31:38,259 --> 01:31:39,487
Look at you.

1348
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:41,653
When's the last time you had a bath?

1349
01:31:41,729 --> 01:31:42,753
- Ah...
- Scum.

1350
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:44,229
- What?
- Scum is what you are.

1351
01:31:44,298 --> 01:31:45,663
And you.

1352
01:31:45,733 --> 01:31:47,325
Why on earth would any girl...

1353
01:31:48,569 --> 01:31:50,696
Would any girl what?

1354
01:31:50,771 --> 01:31:52,671
Would any girl want to...

1355
01:31:52,740 --> 01:31:54,571
- Aah!
- Would any girl what?

1356
01:31:54,642 --> 01:31:56,906
Would any girl what?

1357
01:31:58,246 --> 01:31:59,770
I'm gonna tell my dad.

1358
01:31:59,847 --> 01:32:01,178
Aah!

1359
01:32:01,249 --> 01:32:03,410
Get off me! You... aah!

1360
01:32:03,484 --> 01:32:06,783
Get off!

1361
01:32:09,757 --> 01:32:11,657
Come on!

1362
01:32:12,693 --> 01:32:14,285
Aah!

1363
01:32:17,932 --> 01:32:20,196
Get off!

1364
01:32:20,268 --> 01:32:22,862
Get off me! Get off me!

1365
01:32:22,937 --> 01:32:25,735
Aah! Aah!

1366
01:32:25,806 --> 01:32:28,775
Help! Help me!

1367
01:32:28,843 --> 01:32:30,435
- Aah!
- Come on!

1368
01:32:30,511 --> 01:32:32,638
Aah! No!

1369
01:32:34,248 --> 01:32:35,545
- Aah!
- Come on!

1370
01:32:35,616 --> 01:32:38,642
Help me! Aah!

1371
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:54,325
Aah! Oh, fuck!

1372
01:35:09,470 --> 01:35:11,438
Tickets, please.

1373
01:35:11,505 --> 01:35:13,530
Ticket, sir.

1374
01:35:13,607 --> 01:35:15,905
Oh, can I get one now?

1375
01:35:16,177 --> 01:35:17,906
- Sure.
- I had to run for the train.

1376
01:35:18,179 --> 01:35:19,646
Where to?

1377
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:22,774
Where are you going to?

1378
01:35:22,850 --> 01:35:24,181
All the way.

1379
01:35:24,251 --> 01:35:26,651
- Return?
- Sorry, no. Single.

1380
01:35:26,721 --> 01:35:27,949
Single.

1381
01:35:28,222 --> 01:35:31,658
All the way.

1382
01:35:31,726 --> 01:35:33,591
That's 10.30, please.

1383
01:35:49,210 --> 01:35:50,575
- Get up.
- Hey!

1384
01:35:50,644 --> 01:35:52,509
You fucking little cunt.

1385
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:54,411
You fucking little cunt.

1386
01:35:54,482 --> 01:35:55,506
Why?

1387
01:35:55,583 --> 01:35:57,608
- Why'd you do it?
- Do what?

1388
01:35:57,685 --> 01:35:59,619
How'd you do it? Was it my laptop?

1389
01:35:59,687 --> 01:36:01,780
You shouldn't leave shit lying about.

1390
01:36:01,856 --> 01:36:03,448
How'd you get the password?

1391
01:36:03,524 --> 01:36:06,550
You had it taped
underneath the fucking thing.

1392
01:36:06,627 --> 01:36:08,458
Where's my phone?

1393
01:36:08,529 --> 01:36:09,894
Where's my fucking phone?

1394
01:36:09,964 --> 01:36:11,795
Trainer.

1395
01:36:13,501 --> 01:36:15,662
Have you any idea
what this has cost me?

1396
01:36:15,736 --> 01:36:17,636
Have you any idea what
it's cost that kid?

1397
01:36:17,705 --> 01:36:19,570
And what did he cost me?

1398
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:20,868
What?

1399
01:36:20,941 --> 01:36:22,738
Him and the others,
what did he cost my mum?

1400
01:36:22,810 --> 01:36:24,710
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- She left me.

1401
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:26,337
Ah, she didn't! She took you!

1402
01:36:26,413 --> 01:36:29,940
In all that time, you couldn't have
come even once to see me?

1403
01:36:30,017 --> 01:36:32,713
What... not once, not even once!

1404
01:36:32,787 --> 01:36:35,620
It took me to come to you,
and you don't even want me here!

1405
01:36:35,689 --> 01:36:37,452
- What?
- Don't say ya do.

1406
01:36:37,525 --> 01:36:38,685
- It's Haddon!
- Who?

1407
01:36:38,759 --> 01:36:41,421
Eric, Jack...
whatever his fucking name is!

1408
01:36:41,495 --> 01:36:44,396
Jack... your greatest
fucking achievement!

1409
01:36:51,272 --> 01:36:53,900
- Zeb...
- Get away from me!

1410
01:37:02,750 --> 01:37:07,244
A monster, Da. A monster over me!

1411
01:37:07,321 --> 01:37:09,585
Well, I hope he suffers.

1412
01:37:09,657 --> 01:37:12,524
I hope they crucify him!
Do you hear me?

1413
01:37:12,593 --> 01:37:14,493
I hope he fucking rots!

1414
01:37:14,562 --> 01:37:16,393
I hope he rots.

1415
01:37:25,940 --> 01:37:27,703
Love?

1416
01:37:27,775 --> 01:37:30,300
Excuse me, love.

1417
01:37:33,013 --> 01:37:34,981
Oh, thank God.

1418
01:37:35,049 --> 01:37:38,883
I thought you were dead
there for a second.

1419
01:37:38,953 --> 01:37:40,580
This is the end of the line, love.

1420
01:37:40,654 --> 01:37:41,951
I'm sorry?

1421
01:37:42,022 --> 01:37:44,957
This train doesn't go any further.

1422
01:37:45,025 --> 01:37:46,549
Thank you.

1423
01:39:23,390 --> 01:39:24,948
Hi.

1424
01:39:25,225 --> 01:39:27,785
What are you doing here?

1425
01:39:27,861 --> 01:39:30,386
- Thinking.
- What about?

1426
01:39:30,464 --> 01:39:32,591
About you.

1427
01:39:34,868 --> 01:39:36,529
I see you're in the papers again.

1428
01:39:39,073 --> 01:39:40,700
Yeah.

1429
01:39:40,774 --> 01:39:44,403
It wasn't me that told them.

1430
01:39:44,478 --> 01:39:46,309
I never thought it was.

1431
01:39:48,248 --> 01:39:50,307
So how come you're here?

1432
01:39:53,854 --> 01:39:54,980
I'm escaping.

1433
01:39:56,323 --> 01:39:59,383
A good a place as any.

1434
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:00,722
You see the tower?

1435
01:40:00,794 --> 01:40:01,954
Yeah, how could I miss it?

1436
01:40:02,029 --> 01:40:03,894
You like it?

1437
01:40:03,964 --> 01:40:06,296
Oh, I love it.

1438
01:40:08,469 --> 01:40:09,902
I would have forgiven you.

1439
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:13,898
Would you?

1440
01:40:16,276 --> 01:40:17,573
Given time.

1441
01:40:25,085 --> 01:40:27,986
It's not about you
anymore, though, is it?

1442
01:40:28,055 --> 01:40:29,613
No.

1443
01:40:33,494 --> 01:40:36,952
Anyway, I've got to go.

1444
01:40:38,966 --> 01:40:40,797
You coming this way?

1445
01:40:43,137 --> 01:40:45,196
No.

1446
01:40:45,272 --> 01:40:46,762
Okay.

1447
01:40:48,509 --> 01:40:50,204
I'll see you around, Jack.

1448
01:40:51,812 --> 01:40:52,710
I love you.

1449
01:40:54,748 --> 01:40:57,216
Damn.

1450
01:40:57,284 --> 01:40:59,479
You beat me to it again.

1451
01:41:53,073 --> 01:41:55,405
<i>Oi, Terry.</i>

1452
01:41:57,878 --> 01:42:00,540
<i>Yeah, they know.</i>

1453
01:42:00,614 --> 01:42:02,241
<i>Everyone knows now.</i>

1454
01:42:03,717 --> 01:42:05,912
<i>I'm on me own now.</i>
