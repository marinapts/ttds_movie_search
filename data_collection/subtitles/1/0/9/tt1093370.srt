There is not any passion in
my life bigger then music.

587
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,193
Is your life ends?

588
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:23,559
You talking like this

589
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:31,435

00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:28,962
I don't have to do this are you mad?

612
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:33,034
You have tried my innocence

613
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:35,029
Listen to me.

614
00:44:46,483 --> 00:44:48,974
Isn't it funny?

615
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:57,587
Don't look here.

616
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:02,125

620
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:08,630
I am his son.

621
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,230
You are Adyta Kashab!

622
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:24,946
Yes.

623
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:28,980
Yes you know me.

624
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:32,519
You Addi Kashab.

625
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,567

runs with somebody else?

626
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,603
Sorry.

627
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:45,666
Yes that was my mother.

628
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,169
who runs with someone else.

629
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:52,715
I have listen in News in this
language which kind I m saying.

630
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:55,046
I am really sorry really.

631
00:45:55,986 --> 00:45:58,181

632
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:01,455
why are you telling sorry?

633
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:08,292
If someone's Mother can do
like this cheap then.

634
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:11,360
you don't have to talk like
this about Mr. Kashab.

635
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:13,297
why can't?

636
00:46:14,538 --> 00:46:15,971
She destroyed my whole family.

637
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:18,968
And make me ashamed
to all of you.

638
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:21,501
Then why I cant
talk like this?

639
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:23,738
Because she was in love.

640
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:25,274
Love!

641
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:27,081
Are you serious?

642
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:32,021
Look its very difficult to know like this
about her because she is your mother.

643
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:35,716
But if someone falls in love
then nothing any right or wrong.

644
00:46:37,094 --> 00:46:38,254
who told you all of this who?

645
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:40,185
in which cheaper Novel
you read this?

646
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:43,156
Everyone says
All is fair in love.

647
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,192
They are telling lie.
Its  all bull shit.

648
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:46,497
Do you understand?

649
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:49,538

You come in with me.

665
00:47:48,732 --> 00:47:50,199

674
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,316
How are you?

675
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:13,587
Come here.

676
00:48:19,463 --> 00:48:20,930
Grand father.
Hi grand father.

677
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:24,724
who's this guy?

678
00:48:26,136 --> 00:48:27,160
He is my friend Grand Pa'.

679
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:29,138
which kind of friend?

680
00:48:29,806 --> 00:48:31,171
Not anything like that
Grand father.

681
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:32,666
Not of which kind?

682
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:35,134
Means only friend.

683
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:37,337
Then why you get
him at home?

684
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,808
Because I lost my train at
an station at night.

685
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:42,352
and he brings me here.

686
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:44,583
If he was not there
then you know

687
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:49,384
Lonely girl is like an open treasure.

688
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,252
I don't knows him we
met in the train.

689
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:57,197
But he comes over 1000 kilo
meters with me at Bhatinda.

690
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:58,629
To bring me home safely.

691
00:48:59,303 --> 00:48:59,701
Good Son.

692
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:01,135
Nor any more friend there?

693
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:04,874

773
00:53:22,899 --> 00:53:24,833
it is a twist in
story suddenly.

774
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:25,764
Lets begin.

775
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:28,671
they are our old family friend.

776
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:31,098
Me and Manjeet was
live together in childhood.

777
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:35,472
All says when they becomes
young then marry them.

778
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:39,615
I feels very nice to hear
that I am marry with Manjeet.

779
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:42,983
when we play home I don't
let Roop to be Manjeet's wife.

780
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:45,584
In the age of 8 years.

781
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,686
Me and Manjeet was standing
together on this tractor.

782
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:51,024
And think that we make
our home behind the farm.

783
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:55,092
And then I becomes young
and takes Manjeet like a joke.

784
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:58,832
But yesterday I feels that my
parents are never comes bigger.

785
00:53:59,236 --> 00:53:59,998
They are serious.

786
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:02,664
All of them are serious
and its not good for me.

787
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,631
Then now?

788
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:07,167
I have to run.

789
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:12,172
You always speak about run.
Its  a cheap thing.

790
00:54:13,216 --> 00:54:14,945
It has many types of
risk and problems.

791
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:16,984
There is nothing any option.

792
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,578
There are thousands of
options. Like?

793
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:21,487
Like you have to inform your
parents about Anjuman

794
00:54:22,726 --> 00:54:23,215
They never accept.

795
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,952
And make me emotional
black mail reversely.

796
00:54:26,696 --> 00:54:27,628
Bad option.

797
00:54:28,198 --> 00:54:30,758
Look if you cant guide your
parents about Anshu

798
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:31,963
then leave him.

799
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:35,198

Mehra Sir please don't beat me

1031

I know I have done something like that

1032
01:19:18,198 --> 01:19:18,926
I have gone away without telling!

1033
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:22,792
while Company was already in loss

1034
01:19:24,672 --> 01:19:26,936
I know that there are rumors
in market about me!

1035
01:19:27,908 --> 01:19:29,603
that I couldn't take my father's place

1036
01:19:30,277 --> 01:19:31,574
company is going to split,

1037
01:19:31,879 --> 01:19:33,039
my girlfriend married to other man!

1038
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:34,569
that's why he run away from the city

1039
01:19:34,848 --> 01:19:35,280
etc.

1040
01:19:36,550 --> 01:19:36,982
false rumors

1041
01:19:39,086 --> 01:19:40,280
by the way

1042
01:19:40,854 --> 01:19:41,218
that all is truth!

1043
01:19:45,225 --> 01:19:46,886
our share prices are at all time low

1044
01:19:47,261 --> 01:19:48,751
all new plans turned out flop!

1045
01:19:49,063 --> 01:19:50,530
besides 572 claims too

1046
01:19:50,798 --> 01:19:53,096
in others word, we are in much trouble!

1047
01:19:53,567 --> 01:19:56,058
we are doomed!

1048
01:19:56,637 --> 01:19:58,127
no worse could happen than that!

1049
01:19:59,873 --> 01:20:04,139
what a man really wants, he gets it!

1050
01:20:05,913 --> 01:20:06,743
and this time I want it really!

1051
01:20:09,083 --> 01:20:10,607
that I will face all problems myself

1052
01:20:11,118 --> 01:20:12,813
that I want to complete
all incomplete plans

1053
01:20:13,253 --> 01:20:15,813
to raise this company as
much as Dad can't think!

1054
01:20:18,359 --> 01:20:19,849
I know you all love him much!

1055
01:20:22,730 --> 01:20:23,287
he is somewhere

1056
01:20:24,631 --> 01:20:25,256
watching us

1057
01:20:26,767 --> 01:20:27,927
so come let show him

1058
01:20:28,235 --> 01:20:30,032
that Boss! don't' need to worry much

1059
01:20:30,637 --> 01:20:31,797
this company can run without you

1060
01:20:32,139 --> 01:20:33,800
and can run better than your expectation!

1061
01:20:34,274 --> 01:20:34,968
so what you say?

1062
01:20:35,776 --> 01:20:36,606
what do you say?

1063
01:20:51,692 --> 01:20:55,219
Mrs. Khanna does not want to entertain,
any settlement of the stage!

1064
01:20:56,663 --> 01:20:59,291
she is here only to honor the
request for this meeting

1065
01:21:00,667 --> 01:21:05,297
she thinks that Mr. Aditya behaved to her
in very inappropriate manner

1066
01:21:05,906 --> 01:21:07,237
so there's no further company negotiation

1067
01:21:07,841 --> 01:21:09,900
you talk too much!

1068
01:21:10,978 --> 01:21:13,640

1069
01:21:14,982 --> 01:21:16,882

like you for two three days

1070
01:21:17,251 --> 01:21:17,774

1072
01:21:21,155 --> 01:21:21,985
I'm ready to sign it.

1073
01:21:23,257 --> 01:21:24,189

01:21:31,765 --> 01:21:32,732
and ask him, how
much is his mobile bill!

1077
01:21:35,803 --> 01:21:37,202
Mrs. Khanna whatever you
do, in your personal life,

1078
01:21:38,939 --> 01:21:40,668
with your husband and family,

1079
01:21:42,075 --> 01:21:43,042
that's your personal matter!

1080
01:21:45,112 --> 01:21:46,943
that's none of company's concern

1081
01:21:49,950 --> 01:21:52,646
I can not snatch your whole life effort,
because of this,

1082
01:21:54,755 --> 01:21:57,349
you and Mr. Kashaf started
this company in a room,

1083
01:21:59,193 --> 01:22:02,060
because of your efforts, this
company is at this stage,

1084
01:22:05,699 --> 01:22:09,260
these five things,
you can't ask to anyone,

1085
01:22:10,704 --> 01:22:11,762
and no one can give it to you,

1086
01:22:16,243 --> 01:22:18,006
this company is as much your as mine,

1087
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:24,246
I want to give you the same place,
same responsibilities,

01:22:25,786 --> 01:22:27,048

1089
01:22:28,889 --> 01:22:29,355

1090
01:22:33,994 --> 01:22:35,427

1094
01:22:55,749 --> 01:22:56,443
Ria,

1095
01:22:57,117 --> 01:22:58,982
call our telecom team, I have
a new product idea,

1096
01:22:59,219 --> 01:22:59,776
ASAP

1097
01:23:00,754 --> 01:23:01,482
and what else am I afraid of?

1098
01:23:02,256 --> 01:23:02,813
Steak owners,

1099
01:23:03,223 --> 01:23:05,123
Arrange the meeting with Steak Owners,
tomorrow morning,

1100
01:23:05,359 --> 01:23:08,123
when they come to know that Mom is back,
I want to see the expression on their faces,

1101
01:23:08,462 --> 01:23:09,724
than I'll put my terms in front of them,

1102
01:23:10,264 --> 01:23:10,855
Addy!

1103
01:23:12,199 --> 01:23:12,756
you tell what happened?

1104
01:23:14,801 --> 01:23:15,426
you went to Manali?

1105
01:23:16,136 --> 01:23:18,070
there you went to some Church or etc?

1106
01:23:19,039 --> 01:23:19,334
Correct, that's right

1107
01:23:19,907 --> 01:23:20,771
no there is something you are hiding!

1108
01:23:21,141 --> 01:23:21,436
the matter is serious,

1109
01:23:22,075 --> 01:23:25,169
I'm afraid, you'll solve all your problem,
if you'll work like that?

1110
01:23:26,213 --> 01:23:28,010
you are doing this much work,
that Bill haven't done in 6 months

1111
01:23:29,783 --> 01:23:30,977
do you have any care of your reputation!

1112
01:23:31,885 --> 01:23:32,817
what is wrong with you,

1113
01:23:34,821 --> 01:23:36,516
what's wrong with me,
How can I forget?

1114
01:23:37,457 --> 01:23:37,821
what?

1115
01:23:38,258 --> 01:23:39,020
the most important thing,

1116
01:23:39,326 --> 01:23:39,917
Annual Report,

1117
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:40,758
no, no!

1118
01:23:41,528 --> 01:23:41,960
I'll see you,

1119
01:28:26,746 --> 01:28:28,771
India's first long distance calling cards,

1120
01:28:29,382 --> 01:28:30,246
Geet!

1121
01:28:31,518 --> 01:28:34,351
for them who wants to talk much!

1122
01:28:35,121 --> 01:28:35,382
Excuse me Sir!

1123
01:28:35,789 --> 01:28:37,347
how you come up with the
idea of calling card in India

1124
01:28:38,091 --> 01:28:39,820
the world is getting shorter,
and India is getting bigger,

1125
01:28:40,527 --> 01:28:41,619
today we talk to worldwide,

1126
01:28:42,262 --> 01:28:44,389
Idea is that, people talk looking to heart,
not looking to bill,

1127
01:28:46,132 --> 01:28:46,655
we'll call, it doesn't really matter,

1128
01:28:47,167 --> 01:28:48,532
Matters is as our terms are meant

1129
01:28:52,606 --> 01:28:53,402
what you thought you'll get rid of me?

1130
01:28:54,641 --> 01:28:55,130
excuse me,
who are you?

1131
01:28:55,642 --> 01:28:56,074
one minute!

1132
01:28:58,778 --> 01:28:59,335
move, hold on a second!

1133
01:29:03,283 --> 01:29:03,578
Sorry!

1134
01:29:05,118 --> 01:29:05,345

1135
01:29:09,656 --> 01:29:10,179

1136
01:29:13,426 --> 01:29:14,393
tell me, what are you looking at?

1137
01:29:16,162 --> 01:29:17,220
where is she? tell me!

1138
01:29:20,233 --> 01:29:20,665
Call her here!

1139
01:29:21,201 --> 01:29:21,826
I want to talk to her!

1140
01:29:24,337 --> 01:29:26,635
but Geet is not with me!

1141
01:29:27,140 --> 01:29:27,538
shut up!

1142
01:29:28,275 --> 01:29:29,572
don't lie to me

1143
01:29:30,810 --> 01:29:32,573
we just met in train,

1144
01:29:32,913 --> 01:29:34,847
we didn't know each other 2 days before!

1145
01:29:35,882 --> 01:29:37,349
Geet has told us everything!

1146
01:29:37,651 --> 01:29:40,449
she saw you from her own eyes,

1147
01:29:42,822 --> 01:29:44,790
Roop saw you, make her run

1148
01:29:45,759 --> 01:29:48,751
and you think that we are..
are we retarded or what?

1149
01:29:51,331 --> 01:29:53,799

01:30:01,408 --> 01:30:02,705
it was explained on the same day,

1154
01:30:03,276 --> 01:30:06,302

1155

because it can't be happen,

1166
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:35,307
that she didn't speak for nine months,

1167
01:30:35,809 --> 01:30:38,300
9 months, I know something
must have happened

1168
01:30:38,845 --> 01:30:39,607
she can't resist herself for 9 hours,

1169
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:43,410

01:31:24,958 --> 01:31:25,947
we aren't going anywhere else

1191
01:31:26,559 --> 01:31:26,888

1192
01:31:28,294 --> 01:31:31,593

1193
01:31:32,365 --> 01:31:33,730
alright than, I'll wait.

1194
01:31:34,567 --> 01:31:37,263
Brother, he's fooling us,

01:31:37,971 --> 01:31:38,733
10 days?

1196
01:31:40,273 --> 01:31:41,797
yes,

1197
01:31:53,319 --> 01:31:54,286
should I ask?

1198
01:31:54,687 --> 01:31:55,619
or you can read my mind?

1199
01:31:58,525 --> 01:31:58,991
I'm going to Manali,

1200
01:32:30,090 --> 01:32:30,522
Sir!

1201
01:32:35,628 --> 01:32:36,628

1202
01:32:38,832 --> 01:32:39,298
hi,
Aditya!

1203
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:43,066
we have never met but maybe
you have heard my name

1204
01:32:43,803 --> 01:32:44,428
Aditya Kashaf

1205
01:32:45,772 --> 01:32:47,069
Aditya Kashaf

1206
01:32:49,542 --> 01:32:49,974
Aditya Kashaf!

1207
01:32:51,878 --> 01:32:53,345
By the way I've heard a lot about you,

1208
01:32:53,746 --> 01:32:54,610
from the same source of course,

1209
01:32:55,048 --> 01:32:57,346
this a present for you,
and your family

1210
01:32:57,984 --> 01:32:58,473
Please!

1211
01:32:59,018 --> 01:32:59,643
Thank you!

1212
01:33:03,823 --> 01:33:04,573
So!

1213
01:33:06,860 --> 01:33:10,887
Actually, Geet's family is
a quite worried,

1214
01:33:11,631 --> 01:33:14,566
she said that after marriage,
you both will go to Bhatinda,

1215
01:33:15,001 --> 01:33:17,561
but I guess, not such happened!

1216
01:33:19,038 --> 01:33:19,663
who?

1217
01:33:21,875 --> 01:33:22,364
what?

1218
01:33:22,775 --> 01:33:24,402
who said that after marriage..

1219
01:33:25,979 --> 01:33:26,445
Geet said!

1220
01:33:27,447 --> 01:33:27,970
which Geet are you talking about?

1221
01:33:33,419 --> 01:33:34,408
how many Geets you know?

1222
01:33:35,922 --> 01:33:36,911
I don't know any Geet!

1223
01:33:42,595 --> 01:33:43,845
Geet!

1224
01:33:50,403 --> 01:33:51,597
take care!

1225
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:01,003
you...

1226
01:34:03,716 --> 01:34:04,410
how Anjuman!

1227
01:34:07,020 --> 01:34:07,987
how can you do this?

1228
01:34:09,055 --> 01:34:09,953
please don't make me feel guilty!

1229
01:34:10,990 --> 01:34:12,685
I didn't tell her to run from home!

1230
01:34:13,459 --> 01:34:13,857
you get it?

1231
01:34:14,661 --> 01:34:15,593
but still she came to meet you!

1232
01:34:16,930 --> 01:34:18,864
leaving all the things behind,

1233
01:34:19,699 --> 01:34:20,131
why?

1234
01:34:20,667 --> 01:34:21,497
because she is mad!

1235
01:34:22,135 --> 01:34:23,432
you know her!

1236
01:34:23,836 --> 01:34:26,430
than you must know that,
how childish she is!

1237
01:34:27,006 --> 01:34:27,995
she lives in a world of dreams

1238
01:34:28,675 --> 01:34:30,666
she thinks that everything happens
as she want that to be!

1239
01:34:33,780 --> 01:34:35,941
and you proved her that she has
no world of dream

1240
01:34:37,083 --> 01:34:38,414
because there lives guys like you!

1241
01:34:39,686 --> 01:34:41,586
look! I know you are a billionaire!

1242
01:34:42,488 --> 01:34:43,750
but this is my personal matter!

1243
01:34:44,457 --> 01:34:45,822
and I don't have to give any
explanations to you!

1244
01:34:47,126 --> 01:34:47,615
right!

1245
01:34:49,462 --> 01:34:51,623
what you have done with her,
there's no explanation left!

1246
01:34:52,832 --> 01:34:53,127
everything is clear!

1247
01:34:55,134 --> 01:34:56,999
but it's not clear that
what are you doing here?

1248
01:34:58,771 --> 01:35:00,466
she never said, that she knows you!

1249
01:35:01,207 --> 01:35:02,697
but you came this far for her sake,

1250
01:35:03,176 --> 01:35:04,666
what's the scene boss?

1251
01:35:12,518 --> 01:35:14,850
I definitely would have told
you what's scene between us!

1252
01:35:16,589 --> 01:35:18,784
but cheaper man like you
is not able to understand!

1253
01:35:21,094 --> 01:35:21,492
Cheap!

1254
01:35:23,029 --> 01:35:23,495
Cheap!

1255
01:35:24,063 --> 01:35:24,529
loser!

1256
01:35:25,598 --> 01:35:26,848
what?

1257
01:35:28,568 --> 01:35:28,966
what's cheap about me?

1258
01:35:30,703 --> 01:35:33,570
you talking like that,
I have promised her to marry?

1259
01:35:34,607 --> 01:35:35,767
I never talked her about marriage!

1260
01:35:37,010 --> 01:35:37,806
she was crazy about that

1261
01:35:38,745 --> 01:35:40,474
we'll do this after marriage,
we'll do that!

1262
01:35:40,913 --> 01:35:42,210
such home, such balcony

1263
01:35:42,682 --> 01:35:43,046
such curtains,

1264
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:48,648
I told her,

1265
01:35:49,088 --> 01:35:49,884
Go back to Bhatinda,

1266
01:35:50,757 --> 01:35:52,691
when she used to call from Simla,
I said the same!

1267
01:35:53,559 --> 01:35:54,491
but, she don't listen to me!

1268
01:35:55,762 --> 01:35:57,252
than take it that way!
don't matters to me at all!

1269
01:35:57,997 --> 01:35:59,225
she isn't back to her

and I'll live in it!

1301
01:42:21,113 --> 01:42:21,579

and today what really
I'm, is just because of you!

1330
01:43:45,197 --> 01:43:48,291

think what Geet would do if she was here!

1331
01:43:49,001 --> 01:43:49,660
and I do the same!

1332
01:43:54,640 --> 01:43:55,197

Oh!

1362
01:45:49,722 --> 01:45:50,279
Oh God!

1363
01:45:52,124 --> 01:45:52,852

1364
01:45:55,127 --> 01:45:56,424

1365
01:45:58,464 --> 01:45:59,658

I'm stuck here in middle!

1369
01:46:20,386 --> 01:46:21,546
All the time I use to think,

1370
01:46:23,722 --> 01:46:24,484
what should I do?

1371
01:46:26,258 --> 01:46:28,249
what should I say
him that he agree,

1372
01:46:32,564 --> 01:46:33,622
I can't understand anything!

1373
01:46:37,569 --> 01:46:39,196
don't know what I was thinking!

1374
01:46:56,355 --> 01:46:57,447
I tell you what you should do!

1375
01:46:58,223 --> 01:46:59,622
just throw out Anjuman from your life!

1376
01:46:59,959 --> 01:47:00,357
do whatever you can,

1377
01:47:02,361 --> 01:47:04,761
he's not coming back!

1378
01:47:05,597 --> 01:47:07,861
he would have come
much early, If he wanted to!

1379
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:09,890
he's not even thinking about you,

1380
01:47:10,369 --> 01:47:11,393
he's happy with his life!

1381
01:47:15,908 --> 01:47:16,806

1382
01:47:17,977 --> 01:47:18,409

01:47:18,877 --> 01:47:19,502
what was he saying?

1384
01:47:27,286 --> 01:47:31,746
Anjuman chapter is closed!

1385
01:47:33,625 --> 01:47:34,284

1386
01:47:35,861 --> 01:47:37,192

1387
01:47:37,863 --> 01:47:38,420

Ok!

1397

You will be restless, rascal.

1422
01:49:19,431 --> 01:49:20,693
You'll be eaten by worms.

1423
01:49:20,693 --> 01:49:22,700
You'll die like a dog.

01:50:39,411 --> 01:50:40,742
It won't happen again.

1431
01:50:41,480 --> 01:50:42,811
There's nothing to worry about.

Very much.

1450
01:52:34,893 --> 01:52:36,155
I live you very much.

1451
01:52:37,963 --> 01:52:39,225
But that's my problem.

1452
01:52:40,732 --> 01:52:43,792
I can feel whatever I like.
Correct?

1453
01:52:47,539 --> 01:52:49,530
You don't have to worry
about that.

1454
01:52:50,175 --> 01:52:50,869
Ok?

1455
01:52:53,278 --> 01:52:54,540
Ok?

1456
01:53:15,834 --> 01:53:18,564
we will leave for Bhatinda in a while.

1457
01:53:20,305 --> 01:53:22,034
No.
- Yes.

1458
01:53:23,675 --> 01:53:25,165
How I'm going to face them?

1459
01:53:25,165 --> 01:53:27,837
what's to face?
You are going home.

1460
01:53:27,837 --> 01:53:28,607
Come on.

1461
01:53:45,297 --> 01:53:46,855
Can I talk to you?

1462
01:53:47,666 --> 01:53:48,758
what is it?

1463
01:53:48,758 --> 01:53:49,391
Just two minutes.

1464
01:53:55,173 --> 01:53:56,765
Now there's no use of talking.

1465
01:53:56,765 --> 01:53:57,976
Please Geet.

1466
01:53:57,976 --> 01:53:58,965
Lets go somewhere.

1467
01:54:00,112 --> 01:54:01,340
I don't want to talk to you.

1468
01:54:01,613 --> 01:54:03,808
I made a mistake.
Ok.

1469
01:54:03,808 --> 01:54:06,248
I wan too coward to take
you home with me.

1470
01:54:07,052 --> 01:54:09,111
I've been acting for nine months
that I'm too strong.

1471
01:54:09,111 --> 01:54:11,883
I'm practical. I'm right
whatever I did.

1472
01:54:11,883 --> 01:54:16,018
But the truth is I couldn't handle
when you came out of nowhere.

1473
01:54:16,018 --> 01:54:17,322
I was scared.

1474
01:54:17,322 --> 01:54:19,796
Of mommy papa, society, religion and all.

1475
01:54:19,796 --> 01:54:22,629
But now, I don't care about anything.

1476
01:54:22,629 --> 01:54:24,635
It's not so important for me.

1477
01:54:26,671 --> 01:54:31,608
You left me alone and helpless.
And after nine months you're saying..

1478
01:54:31,608 --> 01:54:33,109
that you made a mistake.

1479
01:54:34,646 --> 01:54:35,772
How easy it's for you.

1480
01:54:35,772 --> 01:54:38,042
No, it's difficult.

1481
01:54:38,042 --> 01:54:40,710
And I'll ease this difficulty.

1482
01:54:41,787 --> 01:54:42,988
You've had enough.

1483
01:54:42,988 --> 01:54:44,717
Now all problems are mine.

1484
01:54:45,390 --> 01:54:49,127
Lets go to Bhatinda.
we'll talk to mommy papa.

1485
01:54:49,127 --> 01:54:50,389
I'll explain them.

1486
01:54:50,662 --> 01:54:52,254
I'll fix everything.

1487
01:54:52,254 --> 01:54:53,763
Everything will be fine.

1488
01:55:03,942 --> 01:55:05,341
why he had to come now?

1489
01:55:05,341 --> 01:55:06,877
It's was all going to be fine.

1490
01:55:08,013 --> 01:55:09,139
It's too late now.

1491
01:55:10,148 --> 01:55:12,844
Now nothing can be done.
It's too late for that.

1492
01:55:16,688 --> 01:55:17,916
You know Geet.

1493
01:55:19,224 --> 01:55:21,385
My mom and dad didn't
use to love each other.

1494
01:55:23,695 --> 01:55:25,219
They were in love with
some other individuals.

1495
01:55:28,133 --> 01:55:30,226
That's why I had always
been in pain.

1496
01:55:32,304 --> 01:55:34,067
They were very nice
to each other at work.

1497
01:55:35,707 --> 01:55:37,174
But at home...

1498
01:55:39,711 --> 01:55:41,076
I always used to ask myself that

1499
01:55:43,081 --> 01:55:44,446
why did they married each other.

1500
01:55:49,387 --> 01:55:51,412
They should've listened
to their hearts.

1501
01:55:54,226 --> 01:55:56,057
Then eventually everything
would have been all right.

1502
01:56:01,466 --> 01:56:03,400
You should also listen to your heart.

1503
01:56:05,237 --> 01:56:06,295
Then everything will get all right.

1504
01:56:08,006 --> 01:56:08,802
Meaning?

1505
01:56:12,377 --> 01:56:14,311
when many year will be passed..

1506
01:56:14,311 --> 01:56:16,313
these 9 months,

1507
01:56:17,315 --> 01:56:19,442
No one will remember them.

1508
01:56:22,053 --> 01:56:23,281
Really Aditya

1509
01:56:24,523 --> 01:56:26,150
I couldn't have ever thought

1510
01:56:27,425 --> 01:56:29,450
that you would take his side.

1511
01:56:33,965 --> 01:56:36,024
I'm taking your side too.

1512
01:56:37,869 --> 01:56:39,894
You and Anjuman

1513
01:56:40,472 --> 01:56:42,030
are at the same side.

1514
01:56:44,776 --> 01:56:46,038
It's simple.

1515
01:56:47,445 --> 01:56:51,779
Those who love each other,
should live with each other.

1516
01:56:53,485 --> 01:56:54,816
Only then everyone
can stay happy.

1517
01:56:57,289 --> 01:56:58,085
And what about you?

1518
01:57:02,427 --> 01:57:05,225
Do your first affair after
marriage with me.

1519
01:57:05,225 --> 01:57:06,787
I too will be happy by that.

1520
01:57:11,369 --> 01:57:12,165
Done.
- Done.

1521
01:57:20,812 --> 01:57:22,006
No Aditya.

1522
01:57:24,316 --> 01:57:26,216
It doesn't seem right.

1523
01:57:27,586 --> 01:57:28,416
I wish...

1524
01:57:32,490 --> 01:57:34,014
I wish it wasn't right.

1525
01:57:37,028 --> 01:57:37,824
But..

1526
01:58:29,381 --> 01:58:30,405
Evening, when?
Today?

1527
01:58:31,182 --> 01:58:32,513
Are you bringing her?

1528
01:58:32,513 --> 01:58:34,552
Bringing Geet?

1529
01:58:35,420 --> 01:58:36,444
At what time?

1530
01:58:37,288 --> 01:58:38,084
In the evening?

1531
01:58:39,057 --> 01:58:39,955
All right son.

1532
01:58:40,291 --> 01:58:41,883
we'll wait.

1533
01:58:43,161 --> 01:58:43,627
Ok

1534
01:59:12,190 --> 01:59:13,122
what's going on here?

1535
01:59:15,160 --> 01:59:16,889
The girl is returning
home after 9 months.

1536
01:59:39,317 --> 01:59:40,477
Daughter!

1537
01:59:41,486 --> 01:59:42,214
Are you all right?

1538
01:59:42,214 --> 01:59:43,652
Come

1539
01:59:48,426 --> 01:59:50,121
I didn't believe you

1540
01:59:50,121 --> 01:59:51,594
that you'll bring Geet here.

1541
01:59:51,594 --> 01:59:55,599
But you've won our heart
by proving me wrong.

1542
01:59:55,599 --> 01:59:57,191
Great job.

1543
02:00:00,138 --> 02:00:03,039
Thank God my daughter is back home.

1544
02:00:11,216 --> 02:00:13,150
So, brother-in-law!

1545
02:00:14,986 --> 02:00:17,113
You secret couldn't be hidden.

1546
02:00:20,725 --> 02:00:23,250
So, now you can't even
take off your eyes from her.

1547
02:00:23,695 --> 02:00:24,286
wait here.

1548
02:00:31,236 --> 02:00:32,601
Here...
Are you happy now?

1549
02:00:35,473 --> 02:00:36,667
They look beautiful.

1550
02:00:36,667 --> 02:00:39,266
They are made-for-each-other.

1551
02:00:43,114 --> 02:00:43,671
Listen mom.

1552
02:00:48,119 --> 02:00:49,279
Look here guys.

1553
02:00:49,279 --> 02:00:50,514
He's sitting here alone.

1554
02:00:52,557 --> 02:00:54,081
Come, welcome.

1555
02:00:54,081 --> 02:00:55,990
Don't be shy.
You're at Punjabi's place.

1556
02:00:57,128 --> 02:00:58,095
Is your friend?

1557
02:01:01,232 --> 02:01:02,199
Have sweet.

1558
02:01:03,168 --> 02:01:05,500
Don't eat all, leave some.

1559
02:01:06,437 --> 02:01:07,267
Mom.
- Eat it.

1560
02:01:07,772 --> 02:01:10,036
It increases love between
the couple.

1561
02:01:12,410 --> 02:01:13,240
we should tell them.

1562
02:01:13,240 --> 02:01:14,608
what's going on?

1563
02:01:14,608 --> 02:01:16,408
Control yourself brother-in-law.

1564
02:01:17,615 --> 02:01:18,741
So sweet.

1565
02:01:18,741 --> 02:01:20,409
what a smile!

1566
02:01:21,653 --> 02:01:23,018
Shut up, naughty.

1567
02:01:23,018 --> 02:01:24,281
Don't tease them.

1568
02:01:25,390 --> 02:01:26,721
Come, inside.

1569
02:01:27,525 --> 02:01:28,423
Mom, one minute.

1570
02:01:35,266 --> 02:01:38,531
Not like this. You went holding hand.
Now you have come holding hands.

1571
02:01:40,772 --> 02:01:43,070
why are you being shy today?

1572
02:01:47,412 --> 02:01:48,640
That's the right way.

1573
02:01:53,418 --> 02:01:55,079
Mom, I need to talk to you.

1574
02:01:55,079 --> 02:01:56,678
Go inside and meet grandfather.

1575
02:01:56,678 --> 02:01:57,743
I want to talk now.

1576
02:01:57,743 --> 02:01:59,346
Go, he's waiting for you.

1577
02:01:59,346 --> 02:02:01,449
You've to meet a lot of people.
It's a long queue.

1578
02:02:01,449 --> 02:02:03,153
Go.
Take them.

1579
02:02:04,229 --> 02:02:05,253
Come, brother-in-law.

1580
02:02:11,436 --> 02:02:12,494
Greetings grandpa.

1581
02:02:12,494 --> 02:02:13,366
One minute.

1582
02:02:14,672 --> 02:02:15,639
One minute.

1583
02:02:17,709 --> 02:02:20,701
when I saw him for the first time.
I knew it.

1584
02:02:20,701 --> 02:02:24,612
In my age, one can judge
in the first glimpse.

1585
02:02:24,612 --> 02:02:27,207
that what's going on
in between the girl and boy.

1586
02:02:28,620 --> 02:02:31,487
I asked you.
But lied.

1587
02:02:31,487 --> 02:02:34,525
It must have been your idea
to run away.

1588
02:02:34,525 --> 02:02:36,150
Isn't it?

1589
02:02:37,262 --> 02:02:38,354
Isn't it?

1590
02:02:39,697 --> 02:02:41,722
See...
I knew it.

1591
02:02:41,722 --> 02:02:43,664
She's the naughty one
among them two.

1592
02:02:46,237 --> 02:02:47,295
Anyway...

1593
02:02:47,295 --> 02:02:49,704
Mistake can be forgiven once.

1594
02:02:49,704 --> 02:02:53,403
You made your mistake.
You're forgiven too.

1595
02:02:53,403 --> 02:02:57,107
And now, there should
not be any mistakes.

1596
02:02:57,107 --> 02:02:58,148
Got it?

1597
02:03:06,157 --> 02:03:08,182
Son, be careful.

1598
02:03:08,182 --> 02:03:10,523
She's the naughtiest in the family.

1599
02:03:10,523 --> 02:03:13,189
She has teased us a lot.

1600
02:03:13,189 --> 02:03:15,164
She won't spare you.

1601
02:03:21,372 --> 02:03:23,237
You talk to your mom
immediately, it will fine.

1602
02:03:23,237 --> 02:03:23,774
where's mom?

1603
02:03:26,878 --> 02:03:28,246
what's going on here?

1604
02:03:28,246 --> 02:03:30,782
Everything will be settled.
You go and talk to your mom.

1605
02:03:30,782 --> 02:03:32,181
You come too.

1606
02:03:32,181 --> 02:03:33,182
One minute.

1607
02:03:33,182 --> 02:03:35,742
You two ran away...
when?

1608
02:03:35,742 --> 02:03:37,549
when did you run
holding hands?

1609
02:03:37,549 --> 02:03:39,783
There's a misunderstanding.
Actually...

1610
02:03:39,783 --> 02:03:41,484
Brother-in-law, photo..

1611
02:03:41,484 --> 02:03:43,461
Sister, photo.

1612
02:03:43,461 --> 02:03:45,793
will you take our photo,
friend of the brother-in-law?

1613
02:04:10,822 --> 02:04:12,756
Son, why don't you go
and get fresh.

1614
02:04:12,756 --> 02:04:14,325
I'm very fresh.

1615
02:04:14,325 --> 02:04:16,190
You've had a long travel.

1616
02:04:16,190 --> 02:04:16,919
No.

1617
02:04:20,999 --> 02:04:22,489
Take him upstairs to the guest room.

1618
02:04:28,439 --> 02:04:29,599
Look mom.

1619
02:04:29,599 --> 02:04:33,201
Ok daughter,
tell me how have you been.

1620
02:04:33,201 --> 02:04:35,438
It's been nine months.

1621
02:04:35,438 --> 02:04:37,743
Are you all right?

1622
02:04:38,549 --> 02:04:40,449
Don't worry about me.
I'm fine.

1623
02:04:40,449 --> 02:04:42,748
Does Aditya keep you well?

1624
02:04:46,924 --> 02:04:47,948
Yes.

1625
02:04:49,560 --> 02:04:50,993
Isn't he good with you?

1626
02:04:54,332 --> 02:04:59,497
He cares about even more then you.

1627
02:05:06,310 --> 02:05:08,005
Now tell, why did you
cheat me?

1628
02:05:08,279 --> 02:05:11,009
You were going to run with me,
instead you ran with my sister.

1629
02:05:11,282 --> 02:05:14,740
It's wrong, why did you do
this to her?

1630
02:05:14,740 --> 02:05:17,549
what was that I didn't have?

1631
02:05:17,549 --> 02:05:19,886
Tell us.
Do you have an answer?

1632
02:05:19,886 --> 02:05:22,653
Actually...

1633
02:05:22,653 --> 02:05:24,695
what happened?

1634
02:05:24,695 --> 02:05:28,755
Actually there was mistake
due to the darkness.

1635
02:05:28,755 --> 02:05:29,629
Really?

1636
02:05:30,868 --> 02:05:34,429
I thought it was you, but
found your sister in the morning.

1637
02:05:37,742 --> 02:05:40,734
Tell me, who's this guy
that you brought.

1638
02:05:40,734 --> 02:05:41,746
who?

1639
02:05:41,746 --> 02:05:43,771
Your friend.

1640
02:05:44,849 --> 02:05:46,510
Is he my consolation prize?

1641
02:05:46,510 --> 02:05:47,482
in lieu of yourself

1642
02:05:48,920 --> 02:05:50,046
Can I have some space?

1643
02:05:50,321 --> 02:05:52,448
Come on girls leave,
we have to talk.

1644
02:05:53,858 --> 02:05:54,882
Let's go inside.

1645
02:05:57,428 --> 02:06:00,591
You've already married legally,
but we want a function here.

1646
02:06:02,834 --> 02:06:04,825
Don't look at Geet.

1647
02:06:04,825 --> 02:06:06,995
If you have any objection,
we won't do it.

1648
02:06:06,995 --> 02:06:10,563
I want you to talk
to Geet once.

1649
02:06:10,563 --> 02:06:12,802
You don't have any objection.
Don't you?

1650
02:06:14,612 --> 02:06:16,671
Just talk to Geet once.

1651
02:06:16,671 --> 02:06:18,078
That's fine.
It's done.

1652
02:06:19,383 --> 02:06:20,509
You'll have to invite
everyone from your side.

1653
02:06:20,509 --> 02:06:23,349
Of course people from
his side will all come.

1654
02:06:24,455 --> 02:06:25,979
It's good now.

1655
02:06:34,632 --> 02:06:37,658
It's too much.
way out of limits.

1656
02:06:38,369 --> 02:06:39,495
It's a solid confusion.

1657
02:06:39,495 --> 02:06:41,868
Nobody thought it would
have been like that.

1658
02:06:41,868 --> 02:06:44,931
But you don't worry.
Geet's trying to talk to her mom.

1659
02:06:44,931 --> 02:06:47,375
She should've told
her a long ago.

1660
02:06:49,380 --> 02:06:51,082
All the treatment is
being given to you

1661
02:06:51,082 --> 02:06:53,050
And they're trying me
to take bath.

1662
02:06:54,018 --> 02:06:55,679
Enough.
where's Geet?

1663
02:06:55,679 --> 02:06:56,879
I'll talk to her right away.

1664
02:06:56,879 --> 02:06:59,514
wait a second.
She's surrounded by many people.

1665
02:06:59,514 --> 02:07:02,423
I'll talk to her in private.

1666
02:07:02,423 --> 02:07:05,663
Everyone thinks here that
you're my friend.

1667
02:07:05,663 --> 02:07:08,632
If you take her in private
everyone will see it as odd.

1668
02:07:11,969 --> 02:07:14,494
They'll see it odd.

1669
02:07:14,494 --> 02:07:15,903
Then be it odd.

1670
02:07:15,903 --> 02:07:17,708
It's truth.

1671
02:07:17,708 --> 02:07:19,437
That I and her are the couple.

1672
02:07:19,437 --> 02:07:21,078
That exactly what we have to tell them.

1673
02:07:21,078 --> 02:07:24,148
Yes, but let her handle this.

1674
02:07:24,148 --> 02:07:26,776
It's necessary to explain them
in a good way or it will be like

1675
02:07:26,776 --> 02:07:28,910
an insult to family.

1676
02:07:28,910 --> 02:07:30,385
There are many people
present here.

1677
02:07:32,523 --> 02:07:34,047
All these boys...

1678
02:07:34,458 --> 02:07:37,018
They want me to go to
see the sugarcane fields.

1679
02:07:37,018 --> 02:07:38,857
why should I see the
sugarcane fields?

1680
02:07:38,857 --> 02:07:40,693
what's so special about
the sugarcane fields?

1681
02:07:40,693 --> 02:07:42,130
I don't want to see
the sugarcane fields.

1682
02:07:42,130 --> 02:07:44,794
Don't go to see.
Refuse them.

1683
02:07:44,794 --> 02:07:46,166
Don't take tension.

1684
02:07:46,437 --> 02:07:47,961
Everything will be fine.

1685
02:08:02,486 --> 02:08:03,851
Should I tell you something?

1686
02:08:03,851 --> 02:08:06,549
Yours is better then mine.

1687
02:08:07,858 --> 02:08:08,586
Lucky.

1688
02:08:09,727 --> 02:08:11,627
Now tell me,
what's the matter?

1689
02:08:14,532 --> 02:08:16,591
Look mom,

1690
02:08:17,101 --> 02:08:18,932
The things you're doing...

1691
02:08:21,138 --> 02:08:22,469
I mean...

1692
02:08:23,708 --> 02:08:25,198
The thing I want to say...

1693
02:08:27,745 --> 02:08:29,576
There's no problem...

1694
02:08:31,215 --> 02:08:32,682
Everything is fine.

1695
02:08:37,555 --> 02:08:38,954
But here...

1696
02:08:39,690 --> 02:08:40,520
everyone's doing...

1697
02:08:45,730 --> 02:08:47,459
I should lie down for while.

1698
02:08:47,732 --> 02:08:49,199
All right daughter.

1699
02:08:50,568 --> 02:08:51,899
You must be tired.

1700
02:08:52,737 --> 02:08:54,227
Take some rest.

1701
02:08:55,539 --> 02:08:56,631
Sleep.

1702
02:09:12,590 --> 02:09:14,751
Attention everyone.

1703
02:09:15,293 --> 02:09:18,524
On 1 7th...
meaning after two days.

1704
02:09:18,524 --> 02:09:23,260
The temple has approved
the function of marriage.

1705
02:10:19,924 --> 02:10:20,788
Have you told mom?

1706
02:10:20,788 --> 02:10:21,847
No.

1707
02:10:21,847 --> 02:10:23,689
I don't know why.

1708
02:10:24,795 --> 02:10:27,025
I could've told mom very easily,

1709
02:10:27,025 --> 02:10:29,589
even to papa.
I had the chance.

1710
02:10:30,801 --> 02:10:33,167
But I was having
a strange feeling.

1711
02:10:33,167 --> 02:10:35,034
It was like restlessness.

1712
02:10:35,034 --> 02:10:36,835
Like something wrong is
going on.

1713
02:10:37,608 --> 02:10:38,870
Like I'm going to miss the train.

1714
02:10:40,678 --> 02:10:41,235
Come here.

1715
02:10:43,381 --> 02:10:44,609
Let me see.
- what?

1716
02:10:45,983 --> 02:10:46,915
what's this?

1717
02:10:49,987 --> 02:10:50,817
what?

1718
02:10:50,817 --> 02:10:52,287
There

1719
02:10:54,225 --> 02:10:55,658
Your face with so much tension..

1720
02:10:56,394 --> 02:10:57,895
it doesn't suit you.

1721
02:10:57,895 --> 02:10:59,764
You look horrible.

1722
02:10:59,764 --> 02:11:02,927
That face of yours...
Like this.

1723
02:11:06,771 --> 02:11:07,635
Correct.

1724
02:11:07,635 --> 02:11:09,172
You look great this way.

1725
02:11:10,241 --> 02:11:12,943
Keep smiling. If you'll look good,
everything will be good around you.

1726
02:11:12,943 --> 02:11:13,602
Got it?

1727
02:11:16,180 --> 02:11:18,148
You've become just like me.

1728
02:11:23,354 --> 02:11:24,150
Listen.

1729
02:11:25,256 --> 02:11:27,622
Talk to Anjuman, he's a bit troubled.

1730
02:11:27,622 --> 02:11:28,953
I'm coming inside.

1731
02:11:30,394 --> 02:11:31,827
what's going on here?

1732
02:11:33,230 --> 02:11:34,720
One minute,
we want to talk.

1733
02:11:36,667 --> 02:11:41,272
Grandma said, you shouldn't
be together at night till the function.

1734
02:11:41,272 --> 02:11:43,740
Someone has put the right names on you.

1735
02:11:43,740 --> 02:11:45,241
Saali... naughty.

1736
02:11:45,241 --> 02:11:47,678
You've broken my heart,
brother-in-law.

1737
02:11:47,678 --> 02:11:49,771
It's a fight of the lifetime.

1738
02:11:49,771 --> 02:11:51,007
Let's go Geet.

1739
02:11:52,683 --> 02:11:54,014
He's here too.

1740
02:11:54,014 --> 02:11:56,712
Geet, do you... in front of him?

1741
02:11:56,712 --> 02:11:57,855
Shut up.

1742
02:11:57,855 --> 02:11:59,152
we'll talk in the morning.

1743
02:11:59,152 --> 02:12:01,088
It's a cheating.

1744
02:12:01,088 --> 02:12:02,726
Bye brother-in-law.

1745
02:12:02,726 --> 02:12:05,024
Have a good night...
with your friend.

1746
02:12:07,164 --> 02:12:08,096
what happened?

1747
02:12:09,366 --> 02:12:12,130
Geet came to meet you.
She said she'll meet you in morning.

1748
02:12:12,130 --> 02:12:13,670
what?

1749
02:13:16,233 --> 02:13:17,222
Are you ready this early?

1750
02:13:17,222 --> 02:13:19,132
Yes, I'm going in some time.

1751
02:13:20,938 --> 02:13:21,996
Are you leaving?

1752
02:13:23,274 --> 02:13:23,968
I have to

1753
02:13:25,943 --> 02:13:27,308
They won't let you go.

1754
02:13:30,014 --> 02:13:31,481
I won't stay this time, Geet.

1755
02:14:00,411 --> 02:14:02,845
You didn't them yet,
no problem.

1756
02:14:02,845 --> 02:14:04,312
Now we'll tell them.

1757
02:14:04,312 --> 02:14:05,871
I tell you how.

1758
02:14:05,871 --> 02:14:07,941
Look, pick someone.

1759
02:14:07,941 --> 02:14:09,178
whoever comes first.

1760
02:14:09,178 --> 02:14:11,221
Mom, papa or uncle.

1761
02:14:11,221 --> 02:14:14,325
And tell them.
That you will marry.

1762
02:14:14,325 --> 02:14:16,816
Not with Aditya
but Anjuman.

1763
02:14:16,816 --> 02:14:19,829
All programs will be same.

1764
02:14:19,829 --> 02:14:21,296
All arrangements will be same.

1765
02:14:21,296 --> 02:14:24,027
Everyone should be happy
as they already are.

1766
02:14:24,027 --> 02:14:28,037
Just replace Aditya with Anjuman.

1767
02:14:28,037 --> 02:14:31,336
As soon as you'll say this,
they'll ask you thousand questions.

1768
02:14:31,336 --> 02:14:33,210
This, that, how, when, etc...

1769
02:14:33,210 --> 02:14:36,847
Then tell them...
How we met.

1770
02:14:36,847 --> 02:14:41,409
How I used to come to your
hostel with my friend to meet you.

1771
02:14:41,409 --> 02:14:44,454
Then how we...

1772
02:15:46,417 --> 02:15:48,408
There was a strange fear in my heart.

1773
02:15:48,408 --> 02:15:50,112
A restlessness.

1774
02:15:51,321 --> 02:15:52,583
Like something wrong is
being happened.

1775
02:15:54,258 --> 02:15:55,919
Like I'm going to miss the train.

1776
02:16:15,446 --> 02:16:17,505
Geet, wait.

1777
02:16:17,505 --> 02:16:19,139
Are you going to tell them now?

1778
02:16:20,017 --> 02:16:21,382
I'll too.
we'll tell them together.

1779
02:16:50,080 --> 02:16:50,569
what happened?

1780
02:16:51,982 --> 02:16:52,573
what happened, Geet?

1781
02:16:52,573 --> 02:16:53,615
Is he coming?

1782
02:16:55,052 --> 02:16:56,485
who?
- Anjuman.

1783
02:16:57,521 --> 02:16:59,022
Is he coming?

1784
02:16:59,022 --> 02:17:00,182
Yes

1785
02:17:00,724 --> 02:17:01,713
Is he looking here?

1786
02:17:03,594 --> 02:17:04,356
Yes he's looking here.

1787
02:17:22,412 --> 02:17:24,312
I'll always take this
as your favor.

1788
02:17:25,549 --> 02:17:26,345
Just one.

1789
02:17:27,417 --> 02:17:29,078
That you brought Anjuman back.

1790
02:17:29,620 --> 02:17:31,485
Or I could never have realized

1791
02:17:32,356 --> 02:17:33,550
what exactly I want.

1792
02:17:35,092 --> 02:17:37,720
I'm going to listen
to my heart from now on.

1793
02:17:40,397 --> 02:17:42,228
Then everything will be fine.

1794
02:20:48,385 --> 02:20:49,784
Children!

1795
02:20:49,784 --> 02:20:52,287
Your parents had been
very naughty.

1796
02:20:52,287 --> 02:20:54,916
They lied again and again.

1797
02:20:54,916 --> 02:20:59,396
But I caught them at
the first sight.

1798
02:20:59,396 --> 02:21:01,261
Didn't I?

1799
02:21:01,261 --> 02:21:02,628
Yes grandpa.

1800
02:21:02,628 --> 02:21:05,497
See?
It was true, right?

1801
02:21:05,497 --> 02:21:06,831
Yes grandpa.

1802
02:21:06,831 --> 02:21:07,911
Children!

1803
02:21:11,308 --> 02:21:13,776
In our age, a glimpse is enough

1804
02:21:13,776 --> 02:21:15,812
to tell what's going on

1805
02:21:15,812 --> 02:21:19,440
