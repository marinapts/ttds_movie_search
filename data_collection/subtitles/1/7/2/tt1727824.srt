7
00:02:27,354 --> 00:02:28,556
David, look at me.

8
00:04:02,183 --> 00:04:03,951
Oi! You missed one, Pakkie!

9
00:04:04,684 --> 00:04:06,019
I'm not from Pakistan.

10
00:04:28,574 --> 00:04:30,274
Dinner is ready.

11
00:04:30,276 --> 00:04:31,543
I'm not hungry, Mum.

12
00:04:31,545 --> 00:04:32,980
Hmm, where are you going?

13
00:04:33,679 --> 00:04:36,682
- Out with friends.
- A girl?

14
00:04:36,684 --> 00:04:39,384
- Oh, Mum.
- Look at you.

15
00:04:39,386 --> 00:04:40,855
Give your mother
a kiss.

16
00:04:44,557 --> 00:04:46,057
I'm going to be late.

17
00:04:46,059 --> 00:04:47,459
You're always late.

18
00:04:47,461 --> 00:04:49,864
Hi, Papa.
How was work?

19
00:04:52,932 --> 00:04:54,331
Out again, Farrokh?

20
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,100
It's Freddie now, Papa.

21
00:04:56,102 --> 00:04:57,903
Freddie or Farrokh...

22
00:04:57,905 --> 00:04:59,971
what difference does it make
when you're out every night...

23
00:04:59,973 --> 00:05:01,908
no thought of the future
in your head?

24
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,910
Good thoughts,
good words, good deeds.

25
00:05:05,912 --> 00:05:08,012
That's what
you should aspire to.

26
00:05:08,014 --> 00:05:08,947
Yes.

27
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:11,218
And how's that
worked out for you?

28
00:05:35,475 --> 00:05:37,242
Yeah, they're better
than last week.

29
00:05:37,244 --> 00:05:39,278
- They're a cool band.
- Yeah, not bad.

30
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,280
Yeah.

31
00:05:47,954 --> 00:05:49,221
What can I get for you?

32
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,223
Pint of lager.

33
00:05:53,427 --> 00:05:54,896
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

34
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,836
See you, mate.

35
00:06:36,603 --> 00:06:38,002
Humpy Bong?

36
00:06:38,004 --> 00:06:39,071
Humpy Bong.

37
00:06:39,073 --> 00:06:40,939
They're going places.
They're gonna be big.

38
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:43,143
Humpy Bong?
Are you joking?

39
00:06:44,174 --> 00:06:44,309
Don't do it, Tim.

40
00:06:44,311 --> 00:06:45,444
No, I'm sorry, guys,
but...

41
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,112
we're not going anywhere
with this.

42
00:06:47,114 --> 00:06:49,784
What? College gigs, pubs?

43
00:06:51,751 --> 00:06:52,953
Gotta give it a go.

44
00:06:56,223 --> 00:06:58,824
So I just said to him,
"No, you can't do that."

45
00:06:58,826 --> 00:07:00,828
You literally
can't hear anything.

46
00:07:02,228 --> 00:07:04,028
It's a bit silly.

47
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,934
But then everyone else was
in, like, long dresses?

48
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,035
How bizarre.

49
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,641
You all right?

50
00:07:16,143 --> 00:07:19,877
Sorry. Oh, I was just
looking for the band.

51
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:21,781
They're usually out back.

52
00:07:29,723 --> 00:07:31,191
I like your coat.

53
00:07:34,227 --> 00:07:36,263
It's from Biba.

54
00:07:38,564 --> 00:07:39,966
She works there.

55
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,802
Thank you.

56
00:07:46,338 --> 00:07:47,605
I think he's right.

57
00:07:47,607 --> 00:07:48,874
That show
was a load of bollocks.

58
00:07:48,876 --> 00:07:51,410
Well, there was room
for improvement, yeah.

59
00:07:51,412 --> 00:07:54,745
I've got better things to do
with my Saturday nights.

60
00:07:54,747 --> 00:07:56,216
I could give you
their names.

61
00:07:59,752 --> 00:08:01,752
I enjoyed the show.

62
00:08:01,754 --> 00:08:03,290
- Thanks, man.
- Thank you.

63
00:08:05,658 --> 00:08:07,661
I've been following you
for a while, actually.

64
00:08:08,227 --> 00:08:09,860
Smile.

65
00:08:09,862 --> 00:08:12,531
Makes sense
for a dental student.

66
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,932
And you're astrophysics,
aren't you?

67
00:08:14,934 --> 00:08:17,901
- Yeah.
- Makes you the clever one.

68
00:08:17,903 --> 00:08:19,538
Yeah, I suppose
it does, yeah.

69
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,937
I study design here.

70
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:22,339
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

71
00:08:22,341 --> 00:08:25,644
Also, um, I write songs.

72
00:08:25,646 --> 00:08:28,079
Might be
of interest to you.

73
00:08:28,081 --> 00:08:30,382
It's just a bit of fun,
really.

74
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,350
Well, you're
five minutes too late.

75
00:08:32,352 --> 00:08:34,121
Our lead singer
just quit.

76
00:08:37,891 --> 00:08:40,124
Well, then you'll need
someone new.

77
00:08:40,126 --> 00:08:41,161
Any ideas?

78
00:08:44,464 --> 00:08:45,998
What about me?

79
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,700
Uh, not with those teeth,
mate.

84
00:09:19,265 --> 00:09:21,700
I was born with
four additional incisors.

85
00:09:21,702 --> 00:09:24,601
More space in my mouth
means more range.

86
00:09:24,603 --> 00:09:26,806
I'll consider your offer.

87
00:09:32,311 --> 00:09:33,346
Uh, do you play bass?

88
00:09:34,714 --> 00:09:35,982
Nope.

89
00:09:50,197 --> 00:09:52,032
Excuse me. Thanks.

90
00:09:54,968 --> 00:09:56,600
So, you found me, then.

91
00:09:56,602 --> 00:09:58,436
- How can I help you?
- Oh.

92
00:09:58,438 --> 00:10:00,238
Um, I rather liked these.

93
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,441
Do you think
you have them in my size?

94
00:10:02,443 --> 00:10:05,478
This is the ladies' section,
so I'm not exactly sure.

95
00:10:07,014 --> 00:10:09,083
There wasn't a sign
or anything.

96
00:10:10,349 --> 00:10:12,952
I don't think it should
really matter, do you?

97
00:10:19,992 --> 00:10:22,095
I thought
you might like this.

98
00:10:22,996 --> 00:10:24,929
Are you even allowed
to be in here?

99
00:10:24,931 --> 00:10:26,132
No, not really.

100
00:10:32,238 --> 00:10:33,540
One more thing.

101
00:10:34,741 --> 00:10:36,010
May I?

102
00:10:46,886 --> 00:10:49,223
You have such
an exotic look.

103
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:52,193
I love your style.

104
00:10:53,593 --> 00:10:55,595
I think we should all
take more risks.

105
00:11:10,243 --> 00:11:11,911
What do you think?

106
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,618
Oh, cheers.
Thank you.

That's right.

<i>And Roger, of course.</i> The

115
00:11:38,104 --> 00:11:39,571

118
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,947
Who's the Pakkie?

119
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:50,383
Ready, Freddie?

120
00:11:51,284 --> 00:11:52,285

137
00:13:43,863 --> 00:13:45,098
You're late.

138
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,602
This is bollocks!

139
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:58,909
It's counterclockwise,
I think you'll find, John.

140
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,512
Oh, is it?
Thank you, Brian.

141
00:14:00,514 --> 00:14:02,312
Would you like to do it?
Please, feel free.

142
00:14:02,314 --> 00:14:03,615
No, no, no.
Doing a good job.

143
00:14:03,617 --> 00:14:06,583
We sold out every pub and uni
south of Glasgow...

144
00:14:06,585 --> 00:14:08,653
and I'm stuck
in the middle of nowhere,

145
00:14:08,655 --> 00:14:09,754
eating a ham sandwich!

146
00:14:09,756 --> 00:14:12,256
Trouble is, we're just not
thinking big enough.

147
00:14:12,258 --> 00:14:13,825
What have you
got in mind, Fred?

148
00:14:13,827 --> 00:14:14,892
An album.

149
00:14:14,894 --> 00:14:16,860
We can't afford an album.

150
00:14:16,862 --> 00:14:18,564
Oh, we'll find a way.

151
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,369
How much do you think
we can get for this van?

152
00:14:24,003 --> 00:14:26,039
I hope you're joking.

153
00:14:28,174 --> 00:14:29,707
That's three months' wages.

154
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:30,975
And a perfectly good van.

155
00:14:30,977 --> 00:14:32,610
Don't be so dramatic,
darling.

156
00:14:32,612 --> 00:14:35,716
You're recording
an album tonight. Let's go!

157
00:14:42,823 --> 00:14:43,955
Don't you think
I sound like shit?

158
00:14:43,957 --> 00:14:45,188
No, it's good.

159
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,360
- Can we try it again?
- Sure, yeah.

160
00:14:48,027 --> 00:14:49,328
Sure, it's your money.

161
00:14:49,762 --> 00:14:50,927
Literally.

162
00:15:00,973 --> 00:15:02,038
Sounds a lot better.

163
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,609
We need to
get experimental.

164
00:15:05,344 --> 00:15:08,181
Try bouncing us left and right
for the ah-ah-ahs.

165
00:15:15,121 --> 00:15:16,921
Now dead center for the last.

166
00:15:16,923 --> 00:15:18,456
And then blast it!

167
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:19,523
Yes!

168
00:15:26,132 --> 00:15:27,333
That's good, right?

169
00:15:30,602 --> 00:15:32,269
Do we have time
to stack a few more?

170
00:15:32,271 --> 00:15:35,208
The studio opens at 8:00,
so we got 30 more minutes.

171
00:15:40,613 --> 00:15:41,614
Hmm.

172
00:15:45,418 --> 00:15:46,753
- That sounds good, right?
- Yeah.

173
00:15:55,527 --> 00:15:57,495
Oi, RT, who are these kids
in the box?

174
00:15:57,497 --> 00:16:01,465
A student band
doing some weird stuff.

175
00:16:01,467 --> 00:16:02,966
How about demos?
You got some?

176
00:16:02,968 --> 00:16:04,604
Been up all night,
mate.

177
00:16:15,381 --> 00:16:17,448
So the new name is Queen?

178
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,115
As in "Her Royal Highness."

179
00:16:19,117 --> 00:16:20,818
And because
it's outrageous...

180
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,856
and I can't think of anyone
more outrageous than me.

181
00:16:30,362 --> 00:16:34,333
This is the most
impractical bed.

182
00:16:45,344 --> 00:16:47,213
That's beautiful.

183
00:16:59,892 --> 00:17:01,894
Think it has potential.

184
00:17:11,704 --> 00:17:14,204
- I have to go to work.
- I simply won't allow it.

185
00:17:14,206 --> 00:17:16,209
You're going to support me
if I get fired?

186
00:17:17,277 --> 00:17:19,477
I'll always
look after you.

187
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:21,011
I'm going to...

188
00:17:21,013 --> 00:17:22,616
I'm going to be late.

189
00:17:34,761 --> 00:17:36,329
How beautiful you are.

190
00:17:46,306 --> 00:17:47,471
When I was a little girl...

191
00:17:47,473 --> 00:17:51,276
I used to run around the house
and hide and...

192
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,479
he couldn't find me.

193
00:17:54,113 --> 00:17:55,315
Clever girl.

194
00:17:56,749 --> 00:17:58,082
Please tell your father
it's nice to meet him.

195
00:17:58,084 --> 00:17:59,284
I have.

196
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,986
Then thank him
for the lovely birthday cake.

197
00:18:01,988 --> 00:18:03,788
I have.

198
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:06,993
Then tell him his daughter's
an epic shag.

199
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:10,396
Freddie,
he can read lips.

200
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:12,730
Mary...

201
00:18:12,732 --> 00:18:15,432
I can't tell you how long
I have waited for Farrokh...

202
00:18:15,434 --> 00:18:17,201
to bring home
a nice girl like you.

203
00:18:17,203 --> 00:18:18,403
Farrokh?

204
00:18:18,405 --> 00:18:20,938
Did Farrokh not tell you
he was born in Zanzibar?

205
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,207
- No, he did not.
- I used to know a girl

206
00:18:23,209 --> 00:18:24,575
- who was Zanzibari.
- One minute.

207
00:18:24,577 --> 00:18:26,509
I thought Freddie
was born in London.

208
00:18:26,511 --> 00:18:29,047
- Oh, he was. At the age of 18.
- Shut up.

209
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:30,882
Our family is
Indian Parsee.

210
00:18:30,884 --> 00:18:32,650
- Mum. Mum, Mum.
- Mary...

211
00:18:32,652 --> 00:18:33,984
- Mum.
- Mum, please...

212
00:18:33,986 --> 00:18:35,251
Here. Have a look at these.

213
00:18:35,253 --> 00:18:36,621
- Yes. Yeah.
- Please! Please.

214
00:18:36,623 --> 00:18:38,292
- No stopping.
- We need to see those.

215
00:18:38,825 --> 00:18:40,223
A thousand years ago,

216
00:18:40,225 --> 00:18:42,692
the Parsees fled to India
from Persia...

217
00:18:42,694 --> 00:18:44,327
to escape Muslim persecution.

218
00:18:44,329 --> 00:18:46,529
Really?
That's terrible.

219
00:18:46,531 --> 00:18:48,065
So why did you
leave Zanzibar?

220
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:49,267
We didn't leave.

221
00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:50,634
He's so small.

222
00:18:50,636 --> 00:18:52,536
We were chased out with just
the clothes on our backs.

223
00:18:52,538 --> 00:18:54,571
He was quite a good boxer,
actually.

224
00:18:55,841 --> 00:18:57,142
He had to be.

225
00:18:57,144 --> 00:18:58,241
His opponents
went for his teeth

226
00:18:58,243 --> 00:18:59,542
always trying to
punch them in.

227
00:18:59,544 --> 00:19:01,645
Certainly a target.

228
00:19:01,647 --> 00:19:04,348
So how old is he
in this photo?

229
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,516
I think three
or four years old.

230
00:19:05,518 --> 00:19:06,517
Really?
Boxing already at that age?

231
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:07,785
So good.

232
00:19:10,322 --> 00:19:11,524
Mercury?

233
00:19:12,157 --> 00:19:13,359
No looking back.

234
00:19:13,926 --> 00:19:14,992
Only forward.

235
00:19:14,994 --> 00:19:17,126
So now the family name's
not good enough for you?

236
00:19:17,128 --> 00:19:18,896
It's just a stage name.

237
00:19:18,898 --> 00:19:20,867
No, it's not.

238
00:19:22,034 --> 00:19:23,401
I changed it legally.

239
00:19:23,403 --> 00:19:25,605
Got a new passport
and everything.

240
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,105
Kash, how old are you here?

241
00:19:29,107 --> 00:19:30,340
I don't know.

242
00:19:30,342 --> 00:19:31,709
It was before Freddie went off
to boarding school.

243
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:34,479
I sent Farrokh away to make
a good Parsee boy of him.

244
00:19:34,481 --> 00:19:35,980
He was too wild and unruly.

245
00:19:35,982 --> 00:19:37,280
But what good did it do?

246
00:19:37,282 --> 00:19:40,284
Good thoughts,
good words, good deeds.

247
00:19:42,888 --> 00:19:43,753
You can't get anywhere

248
00:19:43,755 --> 00:19:45,088
pretending to be
someone you're not.

249
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,726
Who'd like some cake?

250
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:49,326
Cake is always good.

251
00:19:49,328 --> 00:19:50,394
Hello?

252
00:19:50,396 --> 00:19:51,895
Just a moment.

253
00:19:51,897 --> 00:19:52,898
Freddie Mercury.

254
00:19:53,866 --> 00:19:54,865
Phone call.

255
00:19:54,867 --> 00:19:56,567
Quite like
the sound of that.

256
00:19:56,569 --> 00:19:59,636
Freddie tells me that you're
some sort of a scientist.

257
00:19:59,638 --> 00:20:01,439
- Astrophysics, actually.
- Oh.

258
00:20:01,441 --> 00:20:02,707
Yeah, my father would've
preferred it if I continued.

259
00:20:02,709 --> 00:20:03,973
- When?
- That's very clever.

260
00:20:03,975 --> 00:20:06,109
- He's a dentist.
- I was never a dentist.

261
00:20:06,111 --> 00:20:07,178
That's a picture
I want to see.

262
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,382
He's a dentist.

263
00:20:09,616 --> 00:20:10,814
I see.

264
00:20:10,816 --> 00:20:12,282
That's also quite clever,
actually.

265
00:20:12,284 --> 00:20:13,651
Kash...

266
00:20:13,653 --> 00:20:15,185
what are you doing later?

267
00:20:15,187 --> 00:20:16,420
Homework.

268
00:20:20,126 --> 00:20:21,259
Just making conversation.

269
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,393
What kind of music

270
00:20:22,395 --> 00:20:23,760
was he listening to
back in those days?

271
00:20:23,762 --> 00:20:26,500
Uh, he was listening to
Little Richard.

272
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:30,233
- Very good.
- Richard, yeah.

273
00:20:30,235 --> 00:20:32,201
And his first band...

274
00:20:32,203 --> 00:20:33,507
I have an announcement.

275
00:20:36,608 --> 00:20:39,175
One of the A&R men...

276
00:20:39,177 --> 00:20:41,545
from EMI saw us recording.

277
00:20:41,547 --> 00:20:43,517
Gave our demo
to John Reid.

278
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,349
He looks after Elton John.

279
00:20:46,351 --> 00:20:47,550
Oh, my God.

280
00:20:47,552 --> 00:20:48,754
Mr. Reid wants to meet us...

281
00:20:49,521 --> 00:20:51,521
and possibly, even manage us.

282
00:20:51,523 --> 00:20:53,089
- Shut up.
- You're joking!

283
00:20:53,091 --> 00:20:55,094
Oh, my God!

284
00:21:03,336 --> 00:21:04,602
You're sure
he said 12 o'clock?

285
00:21:04,604 --> 00:21:06,436
Yes. "Midday at
the pub, don't be drunk."

286
00:21:06,438 --> 00:21:07,503
That's what he said.

287
00:21:07,505 --> 00:21:08,571
You look
a bit nervous, Brian.

288
00:21:08,573 --> 00:21:09,640
John, I'm fine.

289
00:21:09,642 --> 00:21:10,774
You're usually
so particular.

290
00:21:10,776 --> 00:21:11,843
You just gotta be cool.

291
00:21:11,845 --> 00:21:13,877
- Wow!
- Wanker.

292
00:21:13,879 --> 00:21:15,746
I didn't know
it was fancy dress, Fred.

293
00:21:15,748 --> 00:21:17,548
I've gotta make
an impression, darling.

294
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,150
You look like
an angry lizard.

295
00:21:20,118 --> 00:21:22,519
- It's your best work.
- Very subtle.

296
00:21:22,521 --> 00:21:23,790
You gonna fly away?

297
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,461
Can I borrow it
for Sunday church?

298
00:21:36,636 --> 00:21:38,803
So, this is Queen.

299
00:21:38,805 --> 00:21:42,172
And you must be
Freddie Mercury.

300
00:21:42,174 --> 00:21:43,473
You've got a gift.

301
00:21:43,475 --> 00:21:45,210
You all have.

302
00:21:45,212 --> 00:21:46,309
So tell me...

303
00:21:46,311 --> 00:21:47,511
what makes Queen
any different

304
00:21:47,513 --> 00:21:50,617
from all the other
wannabe rock stars I meet?

305
00:21:51,684 --> 00:21:54,184
I'll tell you what it is.

306
00:21:54,186 --> 00:21:56,653
We're four misfits
who don't belong together,

307
00:21:56,655 --> 00:21:58,489
playing to the other misfits.

308
00:21:58,491 --> 00:22:00,790
The outcasts right at the back
of the room...

309
00:22:00,792 --> 00:22:03,096
who are pretty sure
they don't belong either.

310
00:22:04,262 --> 00:22:06,131
We belong to them.

311
00:22:07,133 --> 00:22:08,532
We're a family.

312
00:22:08,534 --> 00:22:10,102
But no two of us
are the same.

313
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,170
Paul.

314
00:22:13,172 --> 00:22:14,571
Paul Prenter...

315
00:22:14,573 --> 00:22:16,941
meet Queen...

316
00:22:16,943 --> 00:22:18,142
our new signing.

317
00:22:18,144 --> 00:22:20,411
Paul will be looking after
your day-to-day.

318
00:22:20,413 --> 00:22:21,479
Pleasure.

319
00:22:21,481 --> 00:22:22,712
If I can get you
on the radio...

320
00:22:22,714 --> 00:22:24,615
maybe I can get you
on television.

321
00:22:24,617 --> 00:22:26,817
- <i>Top of the Pops?</i>
- Hopefully.

322
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:27,884
And then?

323
00:22:27,886 --> 00:22:28,752
And then...

324
00:22:28,754 --> 00:22:29,819
it's only the biggest

325
00:22:29,821 --> 00:22:30,922
television program
in the country.

326
00:22:30,924 --> 00:22:32,556
No one's ever even
heard of you.

327
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:34,525
Look, I admire
your enthusiasm.

328
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:36,227
If it goes well,
if it happens...

329
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:39,699
I've got a promotional tour
of Japan in mind.

330
00:22:40,934 --> 00:22:42,365
We'll want more.

331
00:22:42,367 --> 00:22:43,634
Every band wants more.

332
00:22:43,636 --> 00:22:45,739
Every band's not Queen.

333
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:51,608
- Listen, I understand.
- Hurry up.

334
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,076
I understand that
it's the policy of the BBC.

335
00:22:53,078 --> 00:22:54,778
- We have procedures.
- This is shit!

336
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,646
I need you to explain it
to the band, please.

337
00:22:56,648 --> 00:22:58,082
- Okay, let's make it quick.
- Freddie, boys.

338
00:22:58,084 --> 00:23:00,617
Look, chaps,
it is going to be playback.

339
00:23:00,619 --> 00:23:01,751
Lip synch's
all that's required.

340
00:23:01,753 --> 00:23:03,453
We do know how to
play our instruments.

341
00:23:03,455 --> 00:23:05,022
You want me to lip synch?

342
00:23:05,024 --> 00:23:07,424
I don't understand why
we can't simply perform live.

343
00:23:07,426 --> 00:23:08,992
The audience will never know
the difference.

344
00:23:08,994 --> 00:23:10,493
We'll know
the bloody difference.

345
00:23:10,495 --> 00:23:11,796
This is the BBC.

346
00:23:11,798 --> 00:23:13,297
That's how things are done
around here. All right?

347
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:14,800
Don't be a nuisance.

348
00:23:15,667 --> 00:23:17,570
Freddie, it'll be great.

349
00:23:19,137 --> 00:23:22,440
You'll just have to make sure
no one's looking at your lips.

350
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,673
Well,
the way things are done

351
00:23:23,675 --> 00:23:25,343
are a load of bollocks,
old chap.

352
00:23:25,345 --> 00:23:26,576
This is the BBC.

353
00:23:26,578 --> 00:23:28,278
I'm relieved.

354
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,613
You would be.

355
00:23:29,615 --> 00:23:30,815
Perfect performance.

356
00:23:32,018 --> 00:23:34,585
<i>♪ She's a Killer Queen</i>

357
00:23:34,587 --> 00:23:36,586

Number two,

362
00:23:52,972 --> 00:23:54,872
Camera up!

363
00:23:54,874 --> 00:23:56,906
Camera two!
No one wants to see this

364
00:23:56,908 --> 00:23:59,209
while they're eating
their meal.

365
00:23:59,211 --> 00:24:02,346

<i>♪ To absolutely drive you

370
00:24:18,998 --> 00:24:22,102
What was it like singing
for all those people?

371
00:24:23,403 --> 00:24:25,405
When I know
they're listening...

372
00:24:26,505 --> 00:24:28,841
when I know
I really have them...

373
00:24:29,742 --> 00:24:32,678
I couldn't sing off-key
if I tried.

374
00:24:34,313 --> 00:24:38,751
I'm exactly the person
I was always meant to be.

375
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:43,056
I'm not afraid of anything.

376
00:24:49,194 --> 00:24:51,327
The only other time
I ever feel that way

377
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:52,732
is when I'm with you.

378
00:25:03,442 --> 00:25:04,944
Don't move.

379
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,683
Don't move.

380
00:25:22,461 --> 00:25:24,698
You're the love of my life.

381
00:25:36,975 --> 00:25:38,143
Freddie.

382
00:25:44,783 --> 00:25:46,851
Which finger
do I put this on?

383
00:25:49,254 --> 00:25:51,188
Wedding finger.

384
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,859
Will you marry me?

385
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,001
Yes!

386
00:26:05,905 --> 00:26:07,538
Are you gonna leave it
in the box?

387
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,511
Freddie, it's beautiful.

388
00:26:14,513 --> 00:26:15,846
I love it.

389
00:26:15,848 --> 00:26:18,215
Promise me
you'll never take it off.

390
00:26:18,217 --> 00:26:20,151
Oh, I promise.

391
00:26:20,153 --> 00:26:21,719
No matter what.

392
00:26:21,721 --> 00:26:24,020
I love you, Freddie.

393
00:26:24,022 --> 00:26:27,090
You're going to do
such great things.

394
00:26:27,092 --> 00:26:29,128
We're going to do
great things.

395
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,033
Your phone's
off the hook.

396
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,565
This is Crystal.

397
00:26:35,567 --> 00:26:36,633
Cheryl!

398
00:26:36,635 --> 00:26:37,768
Oh, that's right.
My mistake.

399
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,002
Where's your loo?

400
00:26:39,004 --> 00:26:41,571
Uh, just down the hall.

401
00:26:41,573 --> 00:26:43,641
Oh, come on in.
Make yourselves at home.

402
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:44,808
Don't mind us.

403
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,942
Hello, Mary.
How's your dad?

404
00:26:46,944 --> 00:26:48,278
Yeah, pretty well.
Thanks.

405
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,579
- Good.
- What's going on, Brian?

406
00:26:49,581 --> 00:26:52,082
Well, if you'd answered your
phone, you'd know already.

407
00:26:52,084 --> 00:26:54,320
This really isn't
a good time, guys.

408
00:26:56,021 --> 00:26:57,989
John Reid called today.

409
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:00,557
He has a little tour
in mind for us.

410
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,162
It's not little,
Brian.

411
00:27:03,628 --> 00:27:05,865
He's booked us a tour
of America.

412
00:27:08,734 --> 00:27:11,036
The album's hit the charts
in the U.S.!

413
00:27:12,471 --> 00:27:13,573
Oh, yes!

414
00:27:16,475 --> 00:27:18,143
Yes!

415
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,544
Yes!

416
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,081
It's happening!

417
00:27:28,154 --> 00:27:30,887
<i>Now, who wants to take a ride?</i>

418
00:28:00,353 --> 00:28:01,955
<i>We love you, Cleveland!</i>

419
00:28:02,821 --> 00:28:04,857
<i>We love you, Houston!</i>

420
00:28:05,823 --> 00:28:07,893
<i>We love you, Denver!
Very happy to be here!</i>

421
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,996
<i>And are the crowds big?</i>

422
00:28:12,998 --> 00:28:14,330
Well, we're selling out
every night.

423
00:28:14,332 --> 00:28:15,932
I just wish you were here
to see it.

424
00:28:15,934 --> 00:28:17,537
<i>They really love us.</i>

425
00:28:19,371 --> 00:28:21,273
<i>We love you, Portland!</i>

426
00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:26,977
<i>He's got a big ass, too!</i>

427
00:28:26,979 --> 00:28:28,915
<i>We love you, New Orleans!</i>

428
00:28:32,784 --> 00:28:34,953
<i>We love you, Atlanta!</i>

429
00:28:39,325 --> 00:28:40,924
<i>Rog, come down here
and say hello.</i>

430
00:28:40,926 --> 00:28:42,792
<i>We love you, Pittsburgh!</i>

431
00:28:42,794 --> 00:28:45,061
- Roger!
- <i>Now, hit it!</i>

432
00:28:45,063 --> 00:28:46,730
<i>I'm good.
I just miss you.</i>

433
00:28:46,732 --> 00:28:47,964
What are you doing?

434
00:28:47,966 --> 00:28:49,932
You can't possibly be having
any fun without me.

435
00:28:49,934 --> 00:28:51,971
<i>Nothing as exciting
as America.</i>

436
00:29:04,183 --> 00:29:05,684
Say hi to the boys for me.

437
00:29:06,819 --> 00:29:08,952
I will. Love you.

438
00:29:08,954 --> 00:29:10,455
Bye, Freddie. I love you.

439
00:30:08,646 --> 00:30:10,082
Hello.

440
00:30:11,149 --> 00:30:12,916
- You're late.
- Am I?

441
00:30:12,918 --> 00:30:14,551
We saved you a seat.

442
00:30:14,553 --> 00:30:15,719
- Lovely.
- Okay.

443
00:30:15,721 --> 00:30:17,086
So, now that
we're all here...

444
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:19,056
Jim, this is Ray Foster.

445
00:30:19,058 --> 00:30:20,958
Ray, this is the
band's lawyer, Jim Beach.

446
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,026
Hello.

447
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,426
You must stop
calling him that.

448
00:30:23,428 --> 00:30:24,327
That's his name.

449
00:30:24,329 --> 00:30:27,163
No, we cannot keep
calling him "Jim Beach."

450
00:30:27,165 --> 00:30:30,703
No, that's absurd, not to
mention, unspeakably boring.

451
00:30:33,105 --> 00:30:34,872
Miami.

452
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:38,144
From now on,
I dub thee "Miami Beach."

453
00:30:39,377 --> 00:30:41,612
The sun always sets
behind you, doesn't it?

454
00:30:41,614 --> 00:30:43,016
On Miami Beach.

455
00:30:44,883 --> 00:30:46,115
Hmm, right.

456
00:30:46,117 --> 00:30:48,317
Now that everybody's
got an acceptable name...

457
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:50,221
let's get to it.
Look...

458
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,392
we just really need
something special.

459
00:30:53,326 --> 00:30:54,624
More hits...

460
00:30:54,626 --> 00:30:55,761
like <i>Killer Queen...</i>

461
00:30:56,328 --> 00:30:57,326
only bigger.

462
00:30:57,328 --> 00:30:59,028
It's not bloody widgets
we're making.

463
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:01,267
We can't just
reproduce <i>Killer Queen.</i>

464
00:31:01,867 --> 00:31:03,435
No.

465
00:31:04,869 --> 00:31:06,405
We can do better.

466
00:31:16,615 --> 00:31:17,948
It's opera.

467
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,982
- Opera!
- Opera!

468
00:31:19,984 --> 00:31:21,319
There seems to be
an echo in here.

469
00:31:51,149 --> 00:31:53,549
See, we don't want to
repeat ourselves.

470
00:31:53,551 --> 00:31:55,618
The same formula
over and over.

471
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:59,055
Formulas are a complete
and utter waste of time.

472
00:31:59,057 --> 00:32:00,390
Formulas work.

473
00:32:00,392 --> 00:32:01,991
Let's stick
with the formulas.

474
00:32:01,993 --> 00:32:03,125
I like formulas.

475
00:32:03,127 --> 00:32:04,830
We'll call the album...

476
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:08,298
<i>A Night at the Opera.</i>

477
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:12,068
Are you aware that no one
actually likes opera?

478
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,305
I like opera.

479
00:32:14,072 --> 00:32:16,138
- Do you?
- I do.

480
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,906
No, don't
misunderstand, darling.

481
00:32:17,908 --> 00:32:19,843
It's a rock and roll record...

482
00:32:19,845 --> 00:32:21,144
with the scale of opera...

483
00:32:21,146 --> 00:32:23,180
the pathos of Greek tragedy...

484
00:32:23,182 --> 00:32:25,449
the wit of Shakespeare...

485
00:32:25,451 --> 00:32:29,486
the unbridled joy
of musical theater.

486
00:32:29,488 --> 00:32:31,888
- It's a musical experience.
- Yeah.

487
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,990
Rather than just
another record.

488
00:32:33,992 --> 00:32:36,092
Something for everyone...

489
00:32:36,094 --> 00:32:37,330
something...

490
00:32:38,496 --> 00:32:39,563
Hmm.

491
00:32:39,565 --> 00:32:42,231
Something that will make
people feel belongs to them.

492
00:32:42,233 --> 00:32:44,736
We'll mix genres,
we'll cross boundaries...

493
00:32:46,638 --> 00:32:49,538
we'll speak in bloody tongues
if we want to.

494
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,607
There's no musical ghetto
that can contain us.

495
00:32:51,609 --> 00:32:53,410
- That's it.
- No one knows what Queen means

496
00:32:53,412 --> 00:32:55,681
because it doesn't mean
one thing.

497
00:32:58,916 --> 00:33:00,218
What do you think, John?

498
00:33:00,586 --> 00:33:01,687
I...

499
00:33:02,288 --> 00:33:03,586
agree with the band.

500
00:33:03,588 --> 00:33:04,690
Of course you do.

501
00:33:06,258 --> 00:33:07,924
How about you, uh...

502
00:33:07,926 --> 00:33:10,393
- Miami.
- Hmm.

503
00:33:10,395 --> 00:33:11,931
Fortune favors the bold.

504
00:33:13,732 --> 00:33:15,334
Surely, a man of your...

505
00:33:16,801 --> 00:33:18,335
unique taste...

506
00:33:18,337 --> 00:33:20,640
isn't afraid
of a little risk?

507
00:33:23,108 --> 00:33:24,876
Please don't make me
regret this.

508
00:33:26,044 --> 00:33:27,612
You're fun.

509
00:33:38,956 --> 00:33:40,926
Recording studio?

510
00:33:42,627 --> 00:33:45,665
Well, the idea was to get away
from all distractions.

511
00:33:46,933 --> 00:33:49,734
Right, I know it's not
the Ritz. Not even close.

512
00:33:50,669 --> 00:33:53,068
- Roger, you're in here.
- Right.

513
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:55,374
Freddie, this is you.
Biggest room.

514
00:33:55,906 --> 00:33:57,907
Brian, that's you.

515
00:33:57,909 --> 00:34:00,278
John, you're downstairs.

516
00:34:06,652 --> 00:34:07,819
And...

517
00:34:08,953 --> 00:34:11,287
this is all yours, John.

518
00:34:11,289 --> 00:34:13,725
Smaller rooms
don't get nearly as cold.

519
00:34:15,861 --> 00:34:17,296
Okay.

520
00:34:36,749 --> 00:34:37,750
Hmm.

521
00:34:47,057 --> 00:34:49,394
Oh, that's really good.

Hmm.

532
00:36:00,098 --> 00:36:01,499
It's beautiful.

533
00:36:08,006 --> 00:36:09,008
What's it called?

534
00:36:10,575 --> 00:36:13,479
<i>Love of My Life.</i>
I wrote it for Mary.

535
00:36:14,113 --> 00:36:15,448
If you say so.

536
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,590
Don't misunderstand, Paul.

537
00:37:00,191 --> 00:37:03,461
Mary knows me in a way
that no one else ever will.

538
00:37:06,731 --> 00:37:08,598
I know you, Freddie Mercury.

539
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,533
Is that what you think?

540
00:37:10,535 --> 00:37:13,303
Oh, no, you don't know me.

541
00:37:13,305 --> 00:37:15,839
You just see
what you want to see.

542
00:37:15,841 --> 00:37:18,444
We work together.
That's all.

543
00:37:26,017 --> 00:37:28,151
I put my heart and soul
into this song.

544
00:37:28,153 --> 00:37:29,419
No one is disputing that.

545
00:37:29,421 --> 00:37:30,486
And you don't like it

546
00:37:30,488 --> 00:37:31,854
because you want
your songs on the album!

547
00:37:31,856 --> 00:37:34,390
- It's not that, Roger.
- Then what is it?

548
00:37:34,392 --> 00:37:36,828
<i>I'm in Love with My Car.</i>

549
00:37:38,129 --> 00:37:39,696
Maybe it's not
strong enough?

550
00:37:39,698 --> 00:37:41,298
What does that even
mean, "not strong enough"?

551
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,200
I know I'm late.
What did I miss?

552
00:37:43,202 --> 00:37:44,500
Discussing Roger's
car song.

553
00:37:44,502 --> 00:37:46,435
Is it strong enough?
That's all I'm asking.

554
00:37:46,437 --> 00:37:48,705
If I'm on my own here,
then I apologize.

555
00:37:48,707 --> 00:37:51,010
How does your new song go,
then, hmm?

556
00:37:53,345 --> 00:37:54,776
"You call me sweet...

557
00:37:54,778 --> 00:37:56,915
"like I'm some
kind of cheese."

558
00:37:57,615 --> 00:37:59,616
- It's good.
- Wow.

559
00:37:59,618 --> 00:38:01,618
"When my hand's
on your grease gun..."

560
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,986
That's very subtle,
isn't it?

561
00:38:02,988 --> 00:38:04,120
It's a metaphor, Brian.

562
00:38:04,122 --> 00:38:05,055
It's just a bit weird,
Roger.

563
00:38:05,057 --> 00:38:07,756
What exactly are you doing
with that car?

564
00:38:07,758 --> 00:38:09,258
Children, please.

565
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,526
We could all
murder each other...

566
00:38:10,528 --> 00:38:12,162
but then who would be left
to record this album?

567
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:14,163
Statistically speaking,
most bands don't fail,

568
00:38:14,165 --> 00:38:15,865
they break up.

569
00:38:15,867 --> 00:38:17,970
Why the hell would
you say something like that?

570
00:38:18,937 --> 00:38:20,504
Roger, there's only room
in this band

571
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:21,803
for one hysterical queen.

572
00:38:21,805 --> 00:38:23,874
You know why
you're angry, Roger?

573
00:38:23,876 --> 00:38:24,841
Why?

574
00:38:24,843 --> 00:38:27,111
'Cause you know your song
isn't strong enough.

575
00:38:30,249 --> 00:38:32,184
- Not...
- Is that strong enough?

576
00:38:33,252 --> 00:38:34,584
What about that?

577
00:38:34,586 --> 00:38:36,722
Not the coffee machine!

578
00:39:12,223 --> 00:39:15,091
<i>♪ Goodbye, everybody</i>

579
00:39:15,093 --> 00:39:18,495
<i>♪ I've got to go</i>

580
00:39:18,497 --> 00:39:25,602
<i>♪ Gotta leave you all behind
and face the truth</i>

581
00:39:25,604 --> 00:39:31,644
<i>♪ Mama
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

582
00:39:32,343 --> 00:39:35,645
<i>♪ I don't wanna die</i>

583
00:39:35,647 --> 00:39:41,319
<i>♪ I sometimes wish
I'd never been born at all ♪</i>

584
00:40:14,586 --> 00:40:16,319
<i>What next?</i>

585
00:40:16,321 --> 00:40:17,553
That was pretty damn good.

586
00:40:17,555 --> 00:40:19,888
Brilliant.
I love that.

587
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:21,258
<i>Press the button, Freddie.</i>

588
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,825
I know,
I know where it is.

589
00:40:22,827 --> 00:40:24,459
I know where...
Knock, knock.

590
00:40:24,461 --> 00:40:25,595
Good.

591
00:40:25,597 --> 00:40:26,928
<i>It's good. Um...</i>

592
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:29,499
You know,
play it like you wrote it.

593
00:40:29,501 --> 00:40:30,903
<i>Well, I did.
I wrote that part.</i>

594
00:40:31,435 --> 00:40:32,569
Taking the piss.

595
00:40:32,571 --> 00:40:33,872
<i>Okay. Are you happy?</i>

596
00:40:34,606 --> 00:40:36,238
I think it's beautiful.

597
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,707
<i>It's almost perfect.</i>

598
00:40:37,709 --> 00:40:38,910
<i>Almost?</i>

599
00:40:39,644 --> 00:40:41,477
Yes, give it
more rock and roll.

600
00:40:41,479 --> 00:40:42,912
<i>I'm always up for that, Fred.</i>

601
00:40:42,914 --> 00:40:44,480
<i>Put your body into it.</i>

602
00:40:44,482 --> 00:40:45,548
<i>Right. Okay.</i>

603
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,683
<i>Put my body into it.
I got it.</i>

604
00:40:46,685 --> 00:40:47,883
Not like that.

605
00:40:47,885 --> 00:40:49,384
<i>No, I got it. I got it.
Bit more soul, yeah?</i>

606
00:40:49,386 --> 00:40:50,687
All right.
Give it more heart.

607
00:40:50,689 --> 00:40:52,154
<i>I'll do that. We good to go?</i>

608
00:40:52,156 --> 00:40:53,122
<i>Roy, you good?</i>

609
00:40:53,124 --> 00:40:55,761
Oh, and then there's
the operatic section.

610
00:40:58,129 --> 00:40:59,495
You're gonna love it.

611
00:40:59,497 --> 00:41:01,464
The operatic section?

612
00:41:01,466 --> 00:41:03,767
- I know, it sounds crazy.
- I love it, Fred. I love it.

613
00:41:03,769 --> 00:41:05,100
<i>I don't know.
It could be a flop.</i>

614
00:41:05,102 --> 00:41:06,368
- <i>It could work.</i>
- I love it!

615
00:41:07,571 --> 00:41:09,104
<i>What have we got to lose?</i>

616
00:41:09,106 --> 00:41:10,640
Nothing.

617
00:41:10,642 --> 00:41:12,075
If you say so.

618
00:41:12,077 --> 00:41:13,243
Okay, let's go.

619
00:41:13,245 --> 00:41:14,310
Deacy.

620
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:30,558
<i>How was that?</i>

621
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,798
- Freddie?
- Higher.

622
00:41:34,466 --> 00:41:35,832
Can you go a bit higher?

623
00:41:35,834 --> 00:41:38,100
If I go any higher,
only dogs will hear me.

624
00:41:38,102 --> 00:41:39,201
Try.

625
00:41:39,203 --> 00:41:40,669
Freddie's note. Sorry.

626
00:41:40,671 --> 00:41:42,437
<i>Go on, roll the tape.</i>

627
00:41:42,439 --> 00:41:45,109
Overdub 24 of "Fred's Thing."

628
00:41:53,584 --> 00:41:54,716
How was that?

629
00:41:54,718 --> 00:41:56,218
- <i>Better?</i>
- Higher.

630
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,888
Jesus! How many more
"Galileos" do you want?

631
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:00,555
Freddie wants to do
a few more overdubs.

632
00:42:00,557 --> 00:42:01,790
Do we even have
any tape left?

633
00:42:01,792 --> 00:42:03,660
I do have to say
the tape is wearing out.

634
00:42:03,662 --> 00:42:04,895
<i>It can't take much more.</i>

635
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,595
Yeah, we can't afford
much more.

636
00:42:06,597 --> 00:42:08,531
We're already
three weeks over schedule.

637
00:42:08,533 --> 00:42:12,271
Dub 26 of "Fred's Thing."

638
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:14,406
One more, one more.

639
00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:16,908
One more.

640
00:42:18,343 --> 00:42:20,042
Again.

641
00:42:20,044 --> 00:42:21,246
Go on, roll the track.

642
00:42:22,914 --> 00:42:24,215
Who even is Galileo?

643
00:42:27,852 --> 00:42:29,819
<i>My nuts feel like
they're in my chest right now.</i>

644
00:42:29,821 --> 00:42:31,220
- Are we done?
- <i>That's it.</i>

645
00:42:31,222 --> 00:42:32,287
<i>He loves you.</i>

646
00:42:37,127 --> 00:42:38,196
That's it.

647
00:42:41,466 --> 00:42:43,168
It's beautiful! Love it!

648
00:43:27,511 --> 00:43:29,515
Christ.

649
00:43:33,818 --> 00:43:35,017
Well...

650
00:43:35,019 --> 00:43:37,020
I'm not entirely sure...

651
00:43:37,022 --> 00:43:39,020
that's the album
you promised us.

652
00:43:39,022 --> 00:43:41,457
No, it's better than the album
we promised you.

653
00:43:41,459 --> 00:43:42,357
It's better than any album

654
00:43:42,359 --> 00:43:44,461
anyone's ever promised you,
darling.

655
00:43:44,463 --> 00:43:45,562
It's a bloody masterpiece.

656
00:43:45,564 --> 00:43:47,562
- Christ.
- It is a good album, Ray.

657
00:43:47,564 --> 00:43:48,897
We prefer "masterpiece."

658
00:43:48,899 --> 00:43:50,468
It's expensive,
and as for...

659
00:43:51,202 --> 00:43:52,502
<i>"Bohemian..."</i>

660
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:53,703
<i>Rhapsody.</i>

661
00:43:53,705 --> 00:43:55,303
Rhapsody.
What is that?

662
00:43:55,305 --> 00:43:57,506
- It's an epic poem.
- It goes on forever.

663
00:43:57,508 --> 00:43:58,941
Six bloody minutes.

664
00:43:58,943 --> 00:44:01,276
I pity your wife if you think
six minutes is forever.

665
00:44:02,946 --> 00:44:04,212
And do you know what?

666
00:44:04,214 --> 00:44:05,682
We're going to release it
as our single.

667
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:08,218
Not possible.
Anything over three minutes...

668
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:11,787
and the radio stations
won't program it, period.

669
00:44:11,789 --> 00:44:14,823
And what on earth
is it about, anyway?

670
00:44:14,825 --> 00:44:16,359
Scaramouche?

671
00:44:16,361 --> 00:44:17,227
Galileo?

672
00:44:17,229 --> 00:44:19,294
And all that
"Ismillah" business!

673
00:44:19,296 --> 00:44:21,399
"Ishmillah"?

674
00:44:22,801 --> 00:44:24,566
Bismillah.

675
00:44:24,568 --> 00:44:25,801
Oh, aye.

676
00:44:25,803 --> 00:44:26,935
Bismillah.

677
00:44:26,937 --> 00:44:29,941
What's it about, anyway?
Bloody Bismillah?

678
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:33,575
True poetry
is for the listener.

679
00:44:33,577 --> 00:44:35,979
It ruins the mystery
if everything's explained.

680
00:44:35,981 --> 00:44:37,479
Seldom ruins sales.

681
00:44:37,481 --> 00:44:39,582
Three minutes
is the standard.

682
00:44:39,584 --> 00:44:40,917
John.

683
00:44:40,919 --> 00:44:42,185
Yeah, we need radio.

684
00:44:42,187 --> 00:44:44,886
Format is three minutes,
I have to agree with Ray.

685
00:44:44,888 --> 00:44:47,189
I actually think
the single's <i>Love of My Life.</i>

686
00:44:47,191 --> 00:44:48,057
No.

687
00:44:48,059 --> 00:44:49,158
Okay, how about John's song...

688
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,828
<i>You're My Best Friend?</i>
You know?

689
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:53,495
"Ooh, you make me live."

690
00:44:53,497 --> 00:44:55,066
Catchy, stronger.

691
00:44:56,767 --> 00:44:59,067
What about
<i>I'm in Love with My Car?</i>

692
00:44:59,069 --> 00:45:00,870
You're joking!
Oh, Jesus.

693
00:45:00,872 --> 00:45:02,705
I love it.

694
00:45:02,707 --> 00:45:04,107
Well,
that's the kind of song...

695
00:45:04,109 --> 00:45:06,642
teenagers can crank up
the volume in their car...

696
00:45:06,644 --> 00:45:08,343
and bang their heads to.

697
00:45:08,345 --> 00:45:12,113
<i>Bohemian Rhapsody</i>
will never be that song.

698
00:45:12,115 --> 00:45:14,816
It's a band decision,
<i>Bohemian Rhapsody.</i>

699
00:45:14,818 --> 00:45:16,584
- That's it.
- <i>You're My Best Friend...</i>

700
00:45:16,586 --> 00:45:17,752
and it's my money.

701
00:45:17,754 --> 00:45:19,323
<i>Bo-Rap,</i> period.

702
00:45:21,426 --> 00:45:22,427
Or we walk.

703
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:26,565
<i>MacArthur Park</i>
was seven minutes long.

704
00:45:27,698 --> 00:45:28,930
It was a hit.

705
00:45:28,932 --> 00:45:31,734
Look, I'm not arguing
<i>Bohemian</i> whatever's...

706
00:45:31,736 --> 00:45:33,035
- musicianship.
- <i>...Rhapsody.</i>

707
00:45:33,037 --> 00:45:34,970
But there's no way in hell
the station will play...

708
00:45:34,972 --> 00:45:37,240
a 6-minute
quasi-operatic dirge...

709
00:45:37,242 --> 00:45:39,542
comprised of nonsense words!

710
00:45:39,544 --> 00:45:41,211
Bismillah? Bullshit!

711
00:45:41,213 --> 00:45:44,513
I paid for this record,
so I say what goes!

712
00:45:44,515 --> 00:45:46,582
Have we no legal
recourse on this?

713
00:45:46,584 --> 00:45:47,584
Ray...

714
00:45:47,586 --> 00:45:49,388
you did <i>Dark Side of the Moon,</i>
didn't you?

715
00:45:51,222 --> 00:45:52,087
I did.

716
00:45:52,089 --> 00:45:54,559
Yeah, I absolutely
love that record.

717
00:45:55,693 --> 00:45:57,861
Legally, no.

718
00:45:57,863 --> 00:46:00,995
No, he's got all your balls
in a vice.

719
00:46:00,997 --> 00:46:02,098
It's a different matter
in the court

720
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,366
of public opinion,
of course.

721
00:46:04,368 --> 00:46:07,972
Ray Foster's a giant name
in the music industry, but...

722
00:46:09,073 --> 00:46:10,943
to the average person...

723
00:46:11,943 --> 00:46:14,178
Say the name Queen,
on the other hand...

724
00:46:16,548 --> 00:46:18,550
ears prick up.

725
00:46:28,794 --> 00:46:31,894
We're going with
<i>You're My Best Friend.</i>

726
00:46:31,896 --> 00:46:32,962
- Done.
- No.

727
00:46:32,964 --> 00:46:36,064
We know what we have,
even if you don't.

728
00:46:36,066 --> 00:46:39,236
It's called <i>Bohemian Rhapsody.</i>

729
00:46:40,638 --> 00:46:44,643
You will forever be known
as the man who lost Queen.

730
00:46:56,821 --> 00:46:58,354
Temperamental artists, eh?

731
00:46:58,356 --> 00:47:00,221
They're well aware
they're tied to a contract...

732
00:47:00,223 --> 00:47:01,557
but who knows
what goes on...

733
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:03,859
inside the inscrutable mind
of the recording artist?

734
00:47:03,861 --> 00:47:04,928
Mark these words.

735
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:06,662
If they're not careful...

736
00:47:06,664 --> 00:47:07,830
by the end of the year...

737
00:47:07,832 --> 00:47:10,568
no one will know
the name Queen.

738
00:47:11,736 --> 00:47:13,305
Christ!

739
00:47:17,975 --> 00:47:20,343
You can take that
out of our royalties!

740
00:47:20,345 --> 00:47:21,944
- Twat!
- Wanker!

741
00:47:21,946 --> 00:47:23,645
You can shove
your gold disks!

742
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,946
You made a mistake, Foster!

743
00:47:24,948 --> 00:47:26,015
Arsehole!

744
00:47:26,017 --> 00:47:27,515
You'll never have
a gold disk...

745
00:47:27,517 --> 00:47:28,753
you medium talent!

746
00:47:29,953 --> 00:47:32,120
And to think
I worked with Hendrix.

747
00:47:32,122 --> 00:47:34,591
<i>In the studio today...</i>

748
00:47:34,593 --> 00:47:38,595
<i>...singer Frederick Mercury!</i>

749
00:47:38,597 --> 00:47:40,029
<i>So what have you
got today for us?</i>

750
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:42,131
Have you got a little taste
of the new record?

751
00:47:42,133 --> 00:47:44,033
I'm really not supposed to.

752
00:47:44,035 --> 00:47:46,605
Oh, forbidden fruit?
Don't tempt me!

753
00:47:47,872 --> 00:47:50,242
- <i>"I'm in Love with My Car!"</i>
- Other side.

754
00:47:52,109 --> 00:47:54,209
<i>"Bohemian Rhapsody."</i>

755
00:47:54,211 --> 00:47:55,879
I didn't know Freddie
knew Kenny so well.

756
00:47:55,881 --> 00:47:57,113
<i>The BBC won't play it.</i>

757
00:47:57,115 --> 00:47:58,247
Nor did I.

758
00:47:58,249 --> 00:48:00,281
In fact, no one will play it
on the radio...

759
00:48:00,283 --> 00:48:02,116
so EMI won't release it.

760
00:48:02,118 --> 00:48:03,919
<i>What's wrong
with this song?</i>

761
00:48:03,921 --> 00:48:06,122
Nothing's wrong
with it at all.

762
00:48:06,124 --> 00:48:08,890
Except that
it's six minutes long.

763
00:48:08,892 --> 00:48:09,991
Six minutes?

764
00:48:09,993 --> 00:48:12,093
You'd have to be mad
to play it.

765
00:48:12,095 --> 00:48:13,261
Oh, you'd have to be bonkers.

766
00:48:13,263 --> 00:48:16,100
- I positively forbid it.
- Let's hear it.

767
00:48:16,868 --> 00:48:18,935
Ladies and ladies...

768
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:21,370
a Capital Radio exclusive...

769
00:48:21,372 --> 00:48:23,573

00:48:23,575 --> 00:48:26,243

Freddie,
when do I get to see you?

789
00:51:06,136 --> 00:51:08,537
I'll be home soon, darling.

790
00:51:08,539 --> 00:51:10,238
<i>Will you put Romeo

00:51:12,977 --> 00:51:14,713
Do you miss me?

793
00:51:16,414 --> 00:51:17,979
What a stupid question.

794
00:51:17,981 --> 00:51:19,617
<i>Of course I do.</i>

795
00:51:25,289 --> 00:51:27,122
I love you.

<i>Good night.</i>

797
00:51:49,146 --> 00:51:50,481
Morning, boss.

798
00:52:03,361 --> 00:52:05,763
Clean this mess up
and get rid of your friend.

799
00:52:08,265 --> 00:52:09,467
Get dressed.

800
00:52:23,647 --> 00:52:24,812
According to Brian...

801
00:52:24,814 --> 00:52:27,918
it was the largest paying
audience in history.

802
00:52:38,896 --> 00:52:40,397
The whole night...

803
00:52:41,499 --> 00:52:43,433
I didn't know
if they understood a thing

804
00:52:43,435 --> 00:52:44,769
I was saying.

805
00:52:46,303 --> 00:52:48,037

00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:15,229
They're all singing.

813
00:53:15,231 --> 00:53:17,568
Thousands of them.

814
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:22,006
All singing to you.

815
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:27,879
Because it's true.

816
00:53:36,053 --> 00:53:38,553
Freddie, what's wrong?

817
00:53:38,555 --> 00:53:40,758
<i>♪ Love of my life,

820
00:53:48,932 --> 00:53:52,436
Something's been wrong
for a while now.

821
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:02,713
Say it.

822
00:54:06,149 --> 00:54:08,086
Say it.

823
00:54:14,357 --> 00:54:17,595
I've been thinking
about it a lot.

824
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:24,769
I think I'm bisexual.

825
00:54:28,539 --> 00:54:29,841
Freddie, you're gay.

826
00:54:48,091 --> 00:54:49,225
I've known for a while now.

827
00:54:49,227 --> 00:54:50,627
I just didn't want to
admit it.

828
00:54:54,097 --> 00:54:56,733
It's funny, really. This is
what I always settle for.

829
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:59,700
"I love you, but..."

830
00:54:59,702 --> 00:55:02,870
"I love you, Mary,
but I need space."

831
00:55:02,872 --> 00:55:06,841
"I love you, Mary,
but I've met someone else."

832
00:55:06,843 --> 00:55:09,813
And now,
"I love you, but I'm..."

833
00:55:15,685 --> 00:55:17,285
And this is the hardest,

834
00:55:17,287 --> 00:55:20,057
because it's not
even your fault.

835
00:55:34,104 --> 00:55:36,240
No, don't take it off.

836
00:55:37,073 --> 00:55:37,939
Don't take it off.

837
00:55:37,941 --> 00:55:39,877
You promised me
you'd never take it off.

838
00:55:43,113 --> 00:55:45,216
What do you want from me?

839
00:55:51,455 --> 00:55:52,991
Almost everything.

840
00:55:56,493 --> 00:55:58,930
I want you in my life.

841
00:56:00,763 --> 00:56:01,765
Why?

842
00:56:05,202 --> 00:56:07,939
We believe in each other.

843
00:56:09,439 --> 00:56:11,275
And that's everything.

844
00:56:13,577 --> 00:56:15,013
For us.

845
00:56:25,589 --> 00:56:29,661
Your life is going to be
very difficult.

846
00:57:02,258 --> 00:57:04,127
What do you think?

847
00:57:06,229 --> 00:57:07,361
Gay-er?

848
00:57:07,363 --> 00:57:09,999
Not this, darling, the house.

849
00:57:10,001 --> 00:57:11,832
Isn't it amazing?

850
00:57:11,834 --> 00:57:13,736
Mary's already
moved in next door,

851
00:57:13,738 --> 00:57:15,671
so she can visit
the cats and me.

852
00:57:15,673 --> 00:57:16,738
Uh-huh.

853
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:18,607
Each cat will have
his own room.

854
00:57:18,609 --> 00:57:20,542
Delilah's by the kitchen...

855
00:57:20,544 --> 00:57:22,009
Miko's next door.

856
00:57:22,011 --> 00:57:24,279
Tiffany, Oscar, Romeo,
all upstairs.

857
00:57:24,281 --> 00:57:28,816
Lilly's room is even larger
than this one! Spoilt thing.

858
00:57:28,818 --> 00:57:29,884
Well, I'm not sure

859
00:57:29,886 --> 00:57:31,720
the echo is quite
pronounced enough.

860
00:57:31,722 --> 00:57:33,988
Eh-oh!

861
00:57:35,993 --> 00:57:38,328
Oh, I knew
you'd appreciate it.

862
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:41,096
Stay for dinner.

863
00:57:41,098 --> 00:57:42,564
Anything you fancy.

864
00:57:42,566 --> 00:57:45,870
I can't.
Wife, kids, you know.

865
00:57:47,171 --> 00:57:48,640
Of course.

866
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:52,441
Well, come on.
We'll eat off the floor.

867
00:57:52,443 --> 00:57:54,209
It's clean enough.

868
00:57:54,211 --> 00:57:55,812
Another time, Fred.

869
00:58:12,763 --> 00:58:14,662
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Mary.

870
00:58:14,664 --> 00:58:16,964
- Hi.
- <i>Hello, my love.</i>

871
00:58:16,966 --> 00:58:18,066
<i>Hi.</i>

872
00:58:18,068 --> 00:58:20,736
I need you to do
something for me.

873
00:58:20,738 --> 00:58:22,837
But you can't
ask any questions.

874
00:58:22,839 --> 00:58:24,238
Freddie, what are you
doing this time?

875
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,711
No, I just told you...
you can't ask any questions.

876
00:58:28,678 --> 00:58:30,912
<i>Right.</i>

877
00:58:30,914 --> 00:58:33,784
I want you to go
to your bedroom window.

878
00:58:34,752 --> 00:58:36,387
<i>Look out of it.</i>

879
00:58:45,662 --> 00:58:48,696
- Do you see me?
- <i>Yes, I do see you.</i>

880
00:58:48,698 --> 00:58:50,801
Now, you do the same.

881
00:58:53,604 --> 00:58:54,806
Oh...

882
00:59:02,546 --> 00:59:04,147
Keep yours on.

883
00:59:06,249 --> 00:59:07,716
Come have a drink.

884
00:59:07,718 --> 00:59:09,287
- <i>Now?</i>
- Right now.

885
00:59:10,254 --> 00:59:11,289
It's late, Freddie.

886
00:59:12,289 --> 00:59:13,721
Come on.

887
00:59:13,723 --> 00:59:14,890
<i>Please.</i>

888
00:59:14,892 --> 00:59:17,028
<i>Do you have something
to drink?</i>

889
00:59:17,627 --> 00:59:18,861
I suppose.

890
00:59:18,863 --> 00:59:20,895
<i>Go get it.
Pour yourself something.</i>

891
00:59:20,897 --> 00:59:22,966
<i>Pour yourself a drink,
darling.</i>

892
00:59:24,834 --> 00:59:26,037
Do you have it?

893
00:59:29,305 --> 00:59:30,907
Yes.

894
00:59:31,542 --> 00:59:33,111
Cheers.

895
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:35,113
<i>Cheers.</i>

896
00:59:36,113 --> 00:59:37,881
To you, my love.

897
00:59:38,883 --> 00:59:40,785
To you, Freddie.

898
00:59:42,718 --> 00:59:43,954
Good night.

899
00:59:44,488 --> 00:59:45,990
Good night.

900
00:59:57,734 --> 00:59:58,901
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Paul.

901
00:59:58,903 --> 00:59:59,968
<i>Freddie?</i>

902
00:59:59,970 --> 01:00:01,336
Sweetheart,
I want to throw a party.

903
01:00:01,338 --> 01:00:03,604
<i>Okay.
Who do you want to invite?</i>

904
01:00:03,606 --> 01:00:04,738
People.

905
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:06,441
I want you to shake
the freak tree

906
01:00:06,443 --> 01:00:08,743
and invite anyone
who plops to the ground.

907
01:00:08,745 --> 01:00:11,912
Dwarfs and giants...

908
01:00:11,914 --> 01:00:16,417
magicians, Zulu tribesmen,
contortionists...

909
01:00:16,419 --> 01:00:18,720
fire eaters...

910
01:00:18,722 --> 01:00:21,055
and priests.

911
01:00:21,057 --> 01:00:23,158
We're going to
need to confess.

912
01:00:33,002 --> 01:00:34,703
Fill me up, will you, Trixie?

913
01:00:34,705 --> 01:00:36,904
Marvelous, Fred!
You've outdone yourself!

914
01:00:36,906 --> 01:00:39,341
Thank you, John.
I'm so glad you love it!

915
01:00:39,343 --> 01:00:42,343
Mmm. They say money can't
buy happiness, darlings!

916
01:00:42,345 --> 01:00:45,381
But it does allow you
to give it away!

917
01:00:45,383 --> 01:00:47,582
I see you and Paul
are getting along quite well.

918
01:00:47,584 --> 01:00:48,883
He's Trixie now...

919
01:00:48,885 --> 01:00:50,419
'cause he's always
up to something.

920
01:00:50,421 --> 01:00:52,287
So, tell me, Rog...

921
01:00:52,289 --> 01:00:55,091
what's the sexiest part
of a car?

922
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:03,832
Ah!

923
01:01:03,834 --> 01:01:05,500
Well, well, well!

924
01:01:05,502 --> 01:01:06,701
Ah, your majesty!

925
01:01:06,703 --> 01:01:08,604
No, I'm not her majesty!

926
01:01:08,606 --> 01:01:10,872
We're her majesty, darlings!

927
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:15,042
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

928
01:01:15,044 --> 01:01:16,345
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

929
01:01:16,347 --> 01:01:18,180
- Thank you, my loves!
- Rog.

930
01:01:18,182 --> 01:01:19,480
Where's Mary?

931
01:01:19,482 --> 01:01:24,021
It's not exactly
her scene, is it, Freddie?

932
01:01:24,754 --> 01:01:25,957
Hmm.

933
01:01:27,091 --> 01:01:28,756
Fabulous, isn't it?

934
01:01:28,758 --> 01:01:30,060
If you say so.

935
01:01:33,696 --> 01:01:34,899
Hmm.

936
01:01:36,033 --> 01:01:38,066
You're starting to look
like each other.

937
01:01:38,068 --> 01:01:39,334
What's wrong with that,
Brian?

938
01:01:39,336 --> 01:01:41,069
You're supposed to be
in a rock band, Freddie.

939
01:01:41,071 --> 01:01:42,337
Not the Village People.

940
01:01:43,539 --> 01:01:45,741
You might want to think about
cutting your hair one day.

941
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:47,609
Never.
I was born like this.

942
01:01:49,113 --> 01:01:51,315
Come on!

943
01:01:52,448 --> 01:01:53,948
- Let's dance!
- Yes!

944
01:01:53,950 --> 01:01:55,783
I don't dance, Freddie.

945
01:01:55,785 --> 01:01:57,486
I need a few more
of these for that.

946
01:01:57,488 --> 01:01:59,955
It's my party,
and I demand you dance!

947
01:01:59,957 --> 01:02:01,122
We should go.

948
01:02:01,124 --> 01:02:02,658
By royal decree!

949
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:03,928
We're gonna go, actually.

950
01:02:04,495 --> 01:02:05,560
Oh, God! You're dull.

951
01:02:05,562 --> 01:02:08,162
If you were any more dull,
you'd be Deacy.

952
01:02:08,164 --> 01:02:09,763
What are you
complaining about?

953
01:02:09,765 --> 01:02:11,034
You've got your little pet.

954
01:02:13,336 --> 01:02:14,669
I have...

955
01:02:14,671 --> 01:02:16,738
and he's loyal.

956
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:19,908
Loyalty's so important.
Don't you think, Dominique?

957
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:21,343
Careful, Fred.

958
01:02:22,879 --> 01:02:24,845
- Let's go.
- Where you going?

959
01:02:24,847 --> 01:02:25,980
Home.

960
01:02:25,982 --> 01:02:27,314
Just a joke.

961
01:02:27,316 --> 01:02:31,252
Freddie, sometimes
you're a total prick.

962
01:02:31,254 --> 01:02:33,423
- Good night.
- Brian.

963
01:02:37,595 --> 01:02:38,727
Forget them.

964
01:02:38,729 --> 01:02:40,796
Come on!
Your guests are waiting.

965
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:42,966
They all want a little
Mercury in their cup.

966
01:02:43,332 --> 01:02:44,334
Come on.

967
01:02:45,236 --> 01:02:46,468
All right!

968
01:02:47,705 --> 01:02:49,270
My darlings...

969
01:02:49,272 --> 01:02:51,107
the time has finally come...

970
01:02:51,742 --> 01:02:53,908
to get absolutely...

971
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:55,613
shit-faced!

972
01:03:00,751 --> 01:03:04,453
Whoo!

973
01:03:04,455 --> 01:03:07,258
<i>Senor,</i> where's
my marching powder?

974
01:03:31,247 --> 01:03:32,848
You've got a set of balls.

975
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:35,883
Go fetch me
a drink and find out.

976
01:03:35,885 --> 01:03:37,185
I may work
for you tonight...

977
01:03:37,187 --> 01:03:39,720
but put your hands on me
again, and I'll thump you.

978
01:03:39,722 --> 01:03:41,055
Got it?

979
01:03:41,057 --> 01:03:42,924
I'm terribly sorry.

980
01:03:42,926 --> 01:03:45,426
I didn't mean to offend you.
I'm sorry.

981
01:03:45,428 --> 01:03:47,828
I won't do that again,
all right?

982
01:03:50,934 --> 01:03:53,004
Let me get you a beer.

983
01:03:55,571 --> 01:03:56,573
I wouldn't mind a beer.

984
01:03:58,675 --> 01:04:01,578
Can you just tell me where
we keep them?

985
01:04:02,946 --> 01:04:05,279
You're very handsome.

986
01:04:05,281 --> 01:04:07,684
I love a man in uniform.

987
01:04:09,653 --> 01:04:11,488
So do I.

988
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:16,924
<i>So, all your friends
have left you alone.</i>

989
01:04:16,926 --> 01:04:18,526
They're not my friends.

990
01:04:18,528 --> 01:04:19,530
Not really.

991
01:04:20,497 --> 01:04:22,497
Just distraction.

992
01:04:22,499 --> 01:04:23,832
From what?

993
01:04:23,834 --> 01:04:26,404
The in-between moments,
I suppose.

994
01:04:28,004 --> 01:04:30,605
I find them intolerable.

995
01:04:30,607 --> 01:04:32,240
All of the...

996
01:04:32,242 --> 01:04:37,048
darkness you thought you left
behind comes creeping back in.

997
01:04:38,848 --> 01:04:40,251
I know what you mean.

998
01:04:41,885 --> 01:04:43,220
Really?

999
01:04:45,287 --> 01:04:46,790
What is it that
you do with them?

1000
01:04:48,459 --> 01:04:50,828
Spend them
with real friends.

1001
01:04:51,961 --> 01:04:54,597
You look like
you could use a friend.

1002
01:05:14,984 --> 01:05:16,519
I like you.

1003
01:05:17,955 --> 01:05:19,356
I like you, too, Freddie.

1004
01:05:22,691 --> 01:05:26,429
Come and find me when
you decide you like yourself.

1005
01:05:32,803 --> 01:05:34,638
Can I have
your name at least?

1006
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,573
It's Jim Hutton.

1007
01:05:38,575 --> 01:05:40,808
- Good night, Jim.
- Good night, Freddie.

1008
01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:42,580
Or should I say good morning?

1009
01:05:46,417 --> 01:05:48,116
I want a new boat.

1010
01:05:48,118 --> 01:05:49,517
This one is for me.
This one.

1011
01:05:49,519 --> 01:05:50,852
Didn't you say
we were going to see him?

1012
01:05:50,854 --> 01:05:52,486
- I've got an hour left.
- Wait. What about this one?

1013
01:05:52,488 --> 01:05:53,754
No, I think
we'll still make that.

1014
01:05:53,756 --> 01:05:54,823
It's a good size.

1015
01:05:54,825 --> 01:05:56,327
Screw him.

1016
01:05:57,794 --> 01:05:59,463
Everyone up
on the drum risers!

1017
01:06:00,363 --> 01:06:02,430
- Up on the drum risers.
- Come on!

1018
01:06:02,432 --> 01:06:04,066
Thank you, Chrissie.
Showing some enthusiasm.

1019
01:06:04,068 --> 01:06:05,500
- Wives and everyone, Brian?
- Me?

1020
01:06:05,502 --> 01:06:06,566
Yes! Come on, John. Everyone.

1021
01:06:06,568 --> 01:06:07,904
- I'm not waiting any longer.
- Let's go.

1022
01:06:08,805 --> 01:06:09,870
Get up.

1023
01:06:09,872 --> 01:06:11,071
- Bass?
- No, you don't need it.

1024
01:06:11,073 --> 01:06:12,374
Get up.

1025
01:06:12,376 --> 01:06:13,611
- Come on, Rog, take your time.
- All right.

1026
01:06:14,577 --> 01:06:15,810
What's this about?

1027
01:06:15,812 --> 01:06:16,778
You remember our last concert?

1028
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:19,548
The crowd were singing
our songs back to us.

1029
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:22,350
I mean, it was deafening,
but it was wonderful.

1030
01:06:22,352 --> 01:06:24,218
They're becoming
a part of our show.

1031
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:26,321
I want to encourage that,
so...

1032
01:06:26,323 --> 01:06:28,991
I've got an idea to involve
them a little bit more.

1033
01:06:28,993 --> 01:06:30,258
Let's start with this.

1034
01:06:32,629 --> 01:06:33,731
Stamp to this beat.

1035
01:06:35,765 --> 01:06:36,767
Genius.

1036
01:06:37,234 --> 01:06:38,636
Thank you, John.

1037
01:06:39,702 --> 01:06:40,703
Come on.

1038
01:06:41,571 --> 01:06:43,607
Good.

1039
01:06:46,309 --> 01:06:48,912
Now, I want you to clap
on the third beat.

1040
01:06:53,082 --> 01:06:54,616
Don't speed up.

1041
01:06:54,618 --> 01:06:56,484
Rog, keep that time.

1042
01:06:56,486 --> 01:06:59,154
No Prenter?

1043
01:06:59,156 --> 01:07:01,055
It's unusual to see you
without your clone.

1044
01:07:01,057 --> 01:07:02,890
It's unusual seeing you
be so bitchy.

1045
01:07:02,892 --> 01:07:04,524
It's usually me.

1046
01:07:04,526 --> 01:07:06,829
Ah, you kept time, Rog.
Good.

1047
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:10,568
What's going on?

1048
01:07:11,267 --> 01:07:12,968
You'd know
if you were on time.

1049
01:07:12,970 --> 01:07:16,740
I'm a performer, darling,
not a Swiss train conductor.

1050
01:07:19,843 --> 01:07:21,575
Sorry I'm late.

1051
01:07:21,577 --> 01:07:22,579
Again.

1052
01:07:23,078 --> 01:07:24,145
All right.

1053
01:07:24,147 --> 01:07:25,513
Now, will you
please tell me

1054
01:07:25,515 --> 01:07:27,115
why you're not playing
any instruments?

1055
01:07:27,117 --> 01:07:31,118
I wanna give the audience
a song that they can perform.

1056
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:32,953
All right?
Let them be part of the band.

1057
01:07:32,955 --> 01:07:34,089
So, what can they do?

1058
01:07:43,133 --> 01:07:44,499
Imagine...

1059
01:07:44,501 --> 01:07:46,334
thousands of people...

1060
01:07:46,336 --> 01:07:47,937
doing this in unison.

1061
01:07:48,571 --> 01:07:49,636
Huh?

1062
01:07:49,638 --> 01:07:50,807
Well?

1063
01:07:51,374 --> 01:07:52,642
What's the lyric?

1064
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:06,354
<i>♪ Buddy, you're a boy
Make a big noise</i>

1065
01:08:06,356 --> 01:08:09,323
<i>♪ Playing in the street
Gonna be a big man some day</i>

1066
01:08:09,325 --> 01:08:11,359
<i>♪ You got mud on your face</i>

1067
01:08:11,361 --> 01:08:12,692
<i>♪ You big disgrace</i>

1068
01:08:12,694 --> 01:08:14,696
<i>♪ Kickin' your can
all over the place</i>

1069
01:08:14,698 --> 01:08:16,096

Eh-oh!

1095
01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:01,102
- Eh-oh!
- Eh-oh!

1096
01:10:03,006 --> 01:10:05,907
Never seen anyone interact
with a crowd like that.

1097
01:10:05,909 --> 01:10:08,112
Bigger than any band,
don't you think?

1098
01:10:10,413 --> 01:10:12,078
I mean, Queen...

1099
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:14,515
how long can that last?

1100
01:10:14,517 --> 01:10:16,151
Did he say
something to you?

1101
01:10:16,153 --> 01:10:17,919
Not explicitly.

1102
01:10:17,921 --> 01:10:20,522
But we've had some interest
from CBS Records...

1103
01:10:20,524 --> 01:10:22,159
about a solo deal.

1104
01:10:32,735 --> 01:10:34,135
Well, that's a big number.

1105
01:10:34,137 --> 01:10:36,237
That's a Freddie-size number.

1106
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:38,441
You should be the one
to propose it.

1107
01:10:39,141 --> 01:10:40,575
Hi, guys. How's it going?

1108
01:10:40,577 --> 01:10:42,176
- Good.
- Everything's great.

1109
01:10:42,178 --> 01:10:43,844
John, another drink?

1110
01:10:43,846 --> 01:10:44,911
Er, no, I'm fine.

1111
01:10:44,913 --> 01:10:46,479
Here's the Coke.
Coming right up.

1112
01:10:46,481 --> 01:10:48,685
- Freddie.
- Oh, there you are.

1113
01:10:50,753 --> 01:10:52,623
Oh, God! Freddie!
Put me down!

1114
01:10:53,990 --> 01:10:55,022
You were brilliant.

1115
01:10:55,024 --> 01:10:57,224
Ah, that's only because
I knew you were watching.

1116
01:10:57,226 --> 01:10:58,358
I've missed you.

1117
01:10:58,360 --> 01:10:59,930
We have
so much to catch up on.

1118
01:11:01,097 --> 01:11:02,729
Oh, thank you.

1119
01:11:02,731 --> 01:11:04,868
This is my boyfriend, David.

1120
01:11:05,467 --> 01:11:07,003
David, this is Freddie.

1121
01:11:08,538 --> 01:11:09,973
Magnificent show.

1122
01:11:10,973 --> 01:11:12,407
Thank you.

1123
01:11:12,409 --> 01:11:15,012
It's so kind of you,
I appreciate it.

1124
01:11:16,046 --> 01:11:17,146
Thank you so much.

1125
01:11:21,583 --> 01:11:22,785
Where's your ring?

1126
01:11:24,119 --> 01:11:26,890
I just didn't want to travel
with something so valuable.

1127
01:11:29,559 --> 01:11:32,193
Freddie, there are some people
here for you to see.

1128
01:11:32,195 --> 01:11:33,497
You promised you'd say hello.

1129
01:11:35,766 --> 01:11:37,201
- Oh, did I?
- Mmm-hmm.

1130
01:11:39,602 --> 01:11:41,035
We should go.

1131
01:11:41,037 --> 01:11:42,039
Will I see you soon?

1132
01:11:43,373 --> 01:11:46,577
Yes, of course.
Of course.

1133
01:11:47,811 --> 01:11:49,309
Mwah!

1134
01:11:49,311 --> 01:11:51,011
It's a pleasure to meet you,
David.

1135
01:11:51,013 --> 01:11:52,246
And you.

1136
01:11:52,248 --> 01:11:53,516
And well done again.

1137
01:11:54,417 --> 01:11:56,019
And you.

1138
01:11:56,319 --> 01:11:57,521
Bye.

1139
01:11:58,955 --> 01:12:01,421
Thank you for coming
such a long way.

1140
01:12:01,423 --> 01:12:02,658
Bye.

1141
01:12:15,805 --> 01:12:17,904
Then you've got
the MTV interview...

1142
01:12:17,906 --> 01:12:22,009
and the plane to Houston
for the special.

1143
01:12:22,011 --> 01:12:23,780
Back here on Friday.

1144
01:12:24,913 --> 01:12:27,184
Listen to me now.

1145
01:12:27,984 --> 01:12:29,916
Do you know who sold

1146
01:12:29,918 --> 01:12:32,021
4% of all the records
purchased last year?

1147
01:12:32,556 --> 01:12:33,991
Worldwide?

1148
01:12:34,992 --> 01:12:36,657
Michael Jackson.

1149
01:12:36,659 --> 01:12:38,926
Not the Jackson 5.

1150
01:12:38,928 --> 01:12:40,094
Michael Jackson.

1151
01:12:40,096 --> 01:12:43,566
And I think
you could do even better.

1152
01:12:44,534 --> 01:12:47,768
In fact, I've had an offer
from CBS Records.

1153
01:12:47,770 --> 01:12:49,036
It's a lot of money
for you, Fred,

1154
01:12:49,038 --> 01:12:51,909
and I think
you should consider it.

1155
01:12:55,544 --> 01:12:59,080
Are you asking me
to break up the band?

1156
01:12:59,082 --> 01:13:03,785
I'm just pointing out what
awaits you if you go solo.

1157
01:13:03,787 --> 01:13:06,222
An end to your
frustrations.

1158
01:13:08,057 --> 01:13:09,792
My frustrations?

1159
01:13:11,226 --> 01:13:12,229
Paul?

1160
01:13:15,163 --> 01:13:17,967
I don't know what
you're talking about, John.

1161
01:13:22,337 --> 01:13:23,737
Perhaps I misunderstood.

1162
01:13:23,739 --> 01:13:25,439
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1163
01:13:25,441 --> 01:13:26,573
Pull over.

1164
01:13:26,575 --> 01:13:27,944
Stop the car, pull over.

1165
01:13:30,379 --> 01:13:32,013
- Get out. Out now!
- What the hell?

1166
01:13:32,015 --> 01:13:33,415
Get out of this car.
You're fired.

1167
01:13:33,417 --> 01:13:34,482
What're you talking about,
fired?

1168
01:13:34,484 --> 01:13:35,616
I said get out.

1169
01:13:35,618 --> 01:13:37,352
- Freddie, you are high!
- I said get out!

1170
01:13:37,354 --> 01:13:38,551
What are you
talking about?

1171
01:13:38,553 --> 01:13:40,623
Out! Out or I'll kill you!

1172
01:13:42,458 --> 01:13:44,858
Get out,
you treacherous piss flap.

1173
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:45,925
You're not
thinking clearly.

1174
01:13:45,927 --> 01:13:47,194
Get your ass
out of my car now.

1175
01:13:47,196 --> 01:13:48,198
Get out!

1176
01:13:48,998 --> 01:13:49,930
Out!

1177
01:13:49,932 --> 01:13:52,633
Get your ass out of my car!
Get out!

1178
01:13:52,635 --> 01:13:55,102
You're firing the
wrong snake, Freddie.

1179
01:13:55,104 --> 01:13:56,571
You'll regret it.

1180
01:13:56,573 --> 01:13:57,837
Get your ass out of here!

1181
01:13:59,943 --> 01:14:00,944
Drive!

1182
01:14:01,945 --> 01:14:04,112
Hey! What the hell? Move!

1183
01:14:04,114 --> 01:14:06,781
Hey, watch it!
I'll run your ass over!

1184
01:14:06,783 --> 01:14:08,919
Move!

1185
01:14:22,865 --> 01:14:25,267
Did you know
anything about this?

1186
01:14:26,668 --> 01:14:28,372
I warned him against it.

1187
01:14:29,138 --> 01:14:30,470
Pure greed.

1188
01:14:30,472 --> 01:14:32,372
Tried to break up
my family.

1189
01:14:32,374 --> 01:14:34,207
We can manage the band.

1190
01:14:34,209 --> 01:14:35,645
We don't need him.

1191
01:14:36,678 --> 01:14:38,815
What do you know
about what I need?

1192
01:14:40,182 --> 01:14:41,749
I know what it's like...

1193
01:14:41,751 --> 01:14:43,550
not to belong.

1194
01:14:43,552 --> 01:14:46,955
A queer Catholic boy
from Belfast.

1195
01:14:46,957 --> 01:14:48,755
You know...

1196
01:14:48,757 --> 01:14:52,762
I think my father
would rather see me dead...

1197
01:14:53,695 --> 01:14:55,731
than let me be who I am.

1198
01:15:00,203 --> 01:15:02,673
I'm gonna take care
of you now, Freddie.

1199
01:15:04,272 --> 01:15:05,842
If you'll let me.

1200
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:19,120
What are you reading?

1201
01:15:19,122 --> 01:15:20,757
Just the cricket.

1202
01:15:26,029 --> 01:15:28,161
We're a rock and roll band.

1203
01:15:28,163 --> 01:15:29,496
We don't do disco.

1204
01:15:29,498 --> 01:15:31,799
- It's not disco.
- Then what is it?

1205
01:15:31,801 --> 01:15:32,899
It's Queen.

1206
01:15:32,901 --> 01:15:34,535
<i>So sorry, my darlings!</i>

1207
01:15:34,537 --> 01:15:35,870
<i>Lost all track!</i>

1208
01:15:35,872 --> 01:15:37,839
You fired Reid
without consulting us!

1209
01:15:37,841 --> 01:15:39,974
You don't make decisions
for the band.

1210
01:15:39,976 --> 01:15:40,977
Hey.

1211
01:15:42,212 --> 01:15:45,179
Well, I'm terribly sorry,
dear.

1212
01:15:45,181 --> 01:15:46,249
It's done.

1213
01:15:47,516 --> 01:15:48,749
Besides...

1214
01:15:48,751 --> 01:15:50,684
Miami will manage us.

1215
01:15:50,686 --> 01:15:52,620
Won't you, darling?

1216
01:15:52,622 --> 01:15:54,555
Erm... I'll think about it.

1217
01:15:54,557 --> 01:15:56,456
- No.
- Are you high again?

1218
01:15:56,458 --> 01:15:57,892
Well done, Columbo.

1219
01:15:57,894 --> 01:15:59,126
You need to slow down, Fred.

1220
01:15:59,128 --> 01:16:01,461
Oh, don't be such a bore.
I'm here, aren't I?

1221
01:16:01,463 --> 01:16:02,529
Are you?

1222
01:16:02,531 --> 01:16:03,734
I don't care
if you're shit-faced.

1223
01:16:05,301 --> 01:16:06,303
As long as you can sing.

1224
01:16:07,870 --> 01:16:10,237
No, John,
I don't wanna play it.

1225
01:16:10,239 --> 01:16:11,371
Then I'm all for it.

1226
01:16:11,373 --> 01:16:12,807
What's that supposed to mean?

1227
01:16:12,809 --> 01:16:14,541
I'm tired of
the bloody anthems.

1228
01:16:14,543 --> 01:16:16,345
I want the energy
in the clubs.

1229
01:16:17,245 --> 01:16:18,313
The bodies,

1230
01:16:18,315 --> 01:16:20,113
- I want to make people move.
- You mean disco?

1231
01:16:20,115 --> 01:16:22,082
Why not?

1232
01:16:22,084 --> 01:16:24,718
Do you mind pissing off?
This is a band discussion.

1233
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:26,754
Drum loops?
Synthesizers?

1234
01:16:26,756 --> 01:16:28,656
- If you say so.
- It's not us!

1235
01:16:28,658 --> 01:16:29,889
- Us?
- It's not Queen!

1236
01:16:29,891 --> 01:16:31,526
Queen is whatever
I say it is!

1237
01:16:32,762 --> 01:16:34,998
Well, you can play
your own bloody drums, then.

1238
01:16:36,565 --> 01:16:37,865
Fred.

1239
01:16:37,867 --> 01:16:39,834
Okay, let's see how good
a boxer you really are!

1240
01:16:39,836 --> 01:16:41,736
Roger, take it easy!
Take it easy!

1241
01:16:41,738 --> 01:16:43,403
Take it easy.

1242
01:16:43,405 --> 01:16:44,406
All right, Muhammad Ali.

That's...

1244
01:16:51,882 --> 01:16:53,915
That's quite a cool riff,
actually.

1245
01:16:53,917 --> 01:16:55,986
Hmm. You wrote that?

1246
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:58,455
That's really good.

1247
01:16:59,555 --> 01:17:00,557
Yes, it will be...

1248
01:17:01,923 --> 01:17:05,227
if you all can
just shut up and play.

1249
01:17:06,061 --> 01:17:08,362
- He started it.

Freddie! Freddie,
as the leader of Queen...

1290
01:19:08,016 --> 01:19:09,349
as the leader of Queen...

1291
01:19:09,351 --> 01:19:11,419
do you feel responsible
for the success of the band?

1292
01:19:11,421 --> 01:19:14,656
I'm not the leader of Queen,
I'm only the lead singer.

1293
01:19:14,658 --> 01:19:16,689
Freddie!
A question for Freddie.

1294
01:19:16,691 --> 01:19:18,024
Do you ever
doubt your talent?

1295
01:19:18,026 --> 01:19:20,193
No, that's a stupid question.

1296
01:19:20,195 --> 01:19:22,028
- Take it easy, Fred.
- What's next?

1297
01:19:22,030 --> 01:19:24,098
Freddie, uh, your teeth!

1298
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:26,166
Why don't you
get your teeth fixed?

1299
01:19:26,168 --> 01:19:28,669
I live in Britain.
I don't want to stand out.

1300
01:19:28,671 --> 01:19:29,804
Next...

1301
01:19:29,806 --> 01:19:31,572
Why don't you have
your manners fixed?

1302
01:19:31,574 --> 01:19:33,807
That's an asshole question
to ask anybody.

1303
01:19:33,809 --> 01:19:35,542
That's an asshole question.

1304
01:19:35,544 --> 01:19:37,411
In your song <i>Life Is Real,</i>

1305
01:19:37,413 --> 01:19:38,746
what do you mean
by the line...

1306
01:19:38,748 --> 01:19:40,247
"Love is a roulette wheel"?

1307
01:19:40,249 --> 01:19:42,182
Are you implying that
the more partners you have...

1308
01:19:42,184 --> 01:19:44,718
the more chances
you have of...

1309
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:46,319
contracting something?

1310
01:19:46,321 --> 01:19:47,324
What?

1311
01:19:48,623 --> 01:19:51,058
I don't know, I haven't
figured out love yet.

1312
01:19:51,060 --> 01:19:53,160
But it implies something else,
Freddie.

1313
01:19:53,162 --> 01:19:55,763
That might be
a better question for Rog.

1314
01:19:55,765 --> 01:19:57,465
Watch it.

1315
01:19:57,467 --> 01:19:59,233
Freddie, concerning
your private life...

1316
01:19:59,235 --> 01:20:00,968
there's lots of pictures
of you in the tabloids...

1317
01:20:00,970 --> 01:20:02,301
looking drunk or ill.

1318
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:04,037
Which one is it, ill or drunk?

1319
01:20:04,039 --> 01:20:06,741
I had a cold last week,
if anyone cares.

1320
01:20:06,743 --> 01:20:09,410
As much as we'd love to answer
questions about colds...

1321
01:20:09,412 --> 01:20:10,710
I'd like to speak
about the album.

1322
01:20:10,712 --> 01:20:12,779
If anyone's got any questions
about the music?

1323
01:20:12,781 --> 01:20:14,148
Freddie! Freddie!
Freddie!

1324
01:20:14,150 --> 01:20:16,216
Freddie! Freddie,
your parents...

1325
01:20:16,218 --> 01:20:18,152
they're conservative
Zoroastrians.

1326
01:20:18,154 --> 01:20:20,787
I wonder, what do they make
of your public persona?

1327
01:20:20,789 --> 01:20:21,855
Is that music...

1328
01:20:21,857 --> 01:20:23,389
My parents died
in a fiery wreck.

1329
01:20:23,391 --> 01:20:26,027
I happen to know
that's not true, is it?

1330
01:20:26,029 --> 01:20:29,129
I just wanted to know whether
they were proud of you.

1331
01:20:29,131 --> 01:20:31,131
Are your parents
proud of you?

1332
01:20:31,133 --> 01:20:32,832
Is this what they hoped for?

1333
01:20:32,834 --> 01:20:34,001
I hope that they are.

1334
01:20:34,003 --> 01:20:35,335
I surely don't think so.

1335
01:20:35,337 --> 01:20:37,136
Anyone wanna talk
about the album?

1336
01:20:37,138 --> 01:20:38,205
Freddie! Freddie!
Freddie!

1337
01:20:38,207 --> 01:20:39,706
Could you answer
my questions please?

1338
01:20:39,708 --> 01:20:41,608
This better be good.

1339
01:20:41,610 --> 01:20:42,710
Shut up!

1340
01:20:42,712 --> 01:20:44,944
Freddie, could you
tell us about the rumors

1341
01:20:44,946 --> 01:20:46,746
concerning your sexuality?

1342
01:20:46,748 --> 01:20:47,814
What about the rumors

1343
01:20:47,816 --> 01:20:49,483
concerning your lack
of sexuality?

1344
01:20:49,485 --> 01:20:52,022
I'm just a musical prostitute,
my dear.

1345
01:20:52,989 --> 01:20:55,191
Can you answer
the question?

1346
01:20:55,824 --> 01:20:57,124
What's your name, dear?

1347
01:20:57,126 --> 01:20:58,492
Shelley Stern.

1348
01:20:58,494 --> 01:20:59,727
- Shelley.
- Yes.

1349
01:20:59,729 --> 01:21:01,761
That thing between your legs,
does it bite?

1350
01:21:01,763 --> 01:21:02,962
Hah!

1351
01:21:02,964 --> 01:21:04,799
Could you answer the question,
please?

1352
01:21:04,801 --> 01:21:05,899
We're here as a courtesy.

1353
01:21:05,901 --> 01:21:07,068
You know, there's
four of us up here.

1354
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:08,202
What are you afraid of,
Freddie?

1355
01:21:08,204 --> 01:21:09,569
What do you want?

1356
01:21:09,571 --> 01:21:10,705
What is the truth?

1357
01:21:10,707 --> 01:21:12,305
Can you be honest for once?

1358
01:21:12,307 --> 01:21:14,008
Why are you lying
about your parents, Freddie?

1359
01:21:14,010 --> 01:21:16,410
I'm not lying about anything.
I just, I'm...

1360
01:21:16,412 --> 01:21:17,978
Your fans deserve
to know the truth, Freddie.

1361
01:21:17,980 --> 01:21:19,078

please?

1362
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:20,447
This is my business.

1363
01:21:20,449 --> 01:21:21,849
No, you're a public figure.

1364
01:21:21,851 --> 01:21:23,149
What are you afraid of,
Freddie?

1365
01:21:23,151 --> 01:21:24,151
- Your parents?
- Can you tell us

1366
01:21:24,153 --> 01:21:25,486
- about...
- Your sexuality?

1367
01:21:25,488 --> 01:21:26,652
What? Why, why...

1368
01:21:26,654 --> 01:21:27,955
Can you just be honest?

1369
01:21:27,957 --> 01:21:29,022

They're Puritans in public,
perverts in private.

I'm never touring
in the U.S. again.

01:23:28,878 --> 01:23:31,881
And I'm
the one being blamed for it.

1398
01:23:32,582 --> 01:23:33,781
Not you, dear...

1399
01:23:33,783 --> 01:23:36,319
whose idea, I believe, it was
to dress up in drag.

1400
01:23:36,852 --> 01:23:38,184
And not you.

1401
01:23:38,186 --> 01:23:40,688

01:24:27,269 --> 01:24:29,102

- Without telling us?

1415
01:24:29,104 --> 01:24:30,437
What kind of deal?

1416
01:24:30,439 --> 01:24:33,243
Look, I'm not saying we won't
record or ever tour again.

1417
01:24:33,809 --> 01:24:35,076
Queen will go on.

1418
01:24:35,078 --> 01:24:36,710
But I need to do
something different.

1419
01:24:36,712 --> 01:24:40,346
Do you know what I mean?
I need to grow.

1420
01:24:40,348 --> 01:24:43,483
What's the song?
"Fly away"?

1421
01:24:43,485 --> 01:24:45,018
"Spread my wings
and fly away."

1422
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:46,356
"Spread my wings
and fly away."

1423
01:24:47,056 --> 01:24:48,421
A solo album?

1424
01:24:48,423 --> 01:24:49,622
Two, actually.

1425
01:24:49,624 --> 01:24:51,125
- Back to back.
- Another word out of you...

1426
01:24:51,127 --> 01:24:52,591
and I'll throw you out
the bloody window.

1427
01:24:52,593 --> 01:24:54,627
But that's years, Freddie.
I mean...

1428
01:24:54,629 --> 01:24:56,831
- that'll take years.
- Ye of little faith.

1429
01:24:56,833 --> 01:24:58,666
I don't believe this.

1430
01:24:58,668 --> 01:24:59,669
How much?

1431
01:25:04,172 --> 01:25:05,874
What did they pay you?

1432
01:25:08,276 --> 01:25:09,943
I wanna know how much
they paid you...

1433
01:25:09,945 --> 01:25:11,281
$4 million!

1434
01:25:15,351 --> 01:25:17,084
That's more than
any Queen deal.

1435
01:25:17,086 --> 01:25:18,785
Look, the routine
is killing us.

1436
01:25:18,787 --> 01:25:21,822
I mean, you must all want a
break from all the arguments.

1437
01:25:21,824 --> 01:25:23,858
I mean, whose song
gets on the album...

1438
01:25:23,860 --> 01:25:25,192
whose song's the single...

1439
01:25:25,194 --> 01:25:26,393
who wrote what...

1440
01:25:26,395 --> 01:25:28,094
who gets a bigger slice
of the royalties...

1441
01:25:28,096 --> 01:25:29,496
what's on the B-side,
all of it.

1442
01:25:29,498 --> 01:25:31,098
You must need a break.

1443
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:32,700
Freddie, we're a family.

1444
01:25:32,702 --> 01:25:34,167
No, we're not!

1445
01:25:34,169 --> 01:25:35,469
We're not a family!

1446
01:25:35,471 --> 01:25:37,938
You've got families,
children, wives.

1447
01:25:37,940 --> 01:25:39,171
What have I got?

1448
01:25:39,173 --> 01:25:41,711
You've got $4 million. Perhaps
you can buy yourself a family.

1449
01:25:44,946 --> 01:25:47,514
I won't compromise
my vision any longer.

1450
01:25:47,516 --> 01:25:49,716
Compromise?

1451
01:25:49,718 --> 01:25:50,850
Are you joking?

1452
01:25:50,852 --> 01:25:53,890
You were working at Heathrow
before we gave you a chance.

1453
01:25:55,857 --> 01:25:58,224
And without me...

1454
01:25:58,226 --> 01:26:00,426
you'd be a dentist...

1455
01:26:00,428 --> 01:26:03,162
drumming 12/8-time blues
at the weekend

1456
01:26:03,164 --> 01:26:04,598
at the Crown and Anchor.

1457
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:05,732
And you.

1458
01:26:05,734 --> 01:26:08,602
Well, you would be
Dr. Brian May...

1459
01:26:08,604 --> 01:26:12,238
author of a fascinating
dissertation on the cosmos...

1460
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:13,676
that no one ever reads.

1461
01:26:14,644 --> 01:26:16,242
And Deacy...

1462
01:26:16,244 --> 01:26:18,046
for the life of me...

1463
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:20,917
nothing comes to mind.

1464
01:26:22,318 --> 01:26:24,216
I studied
electrical engineering.

1465
01:26:24,218 --> 01:26:25,721
Does that meet
your standard?

1466
01:26:26,654 --> 01:26:27,956
Perfect.

1467
01:26:35,964 --> 01:26:37,663
You just killed Queen.

1468
01:26:37,665 --> 01:26:40,901
Oh, give it a kiss one day.
She might wake up.

1469
01:26:40,903 --> 01:26:42,105
You need us, Freddie.

1470
01:26:43,239 --> 01:26:44,371
More than you know.

1471
01:26:44,373 --> 01:26:45,775
I don't need anyone.

1472
01:27:09,931 --> 01:27:11,066
<i>Hello?</i>

1473
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:13,767
Paul.
Can I speak to Freddie?

1474
01:27:13,769 --> 01:27:16,402
Oh, Mary.
No, he can't talk right now.

1475
01:27:16,404 --> 01:27:18,471
He's working day and night,
constantly.

1476
01:27:18,473 --> 01:27:20,174
Will you make sure
to tell him that I called?

1477
01:27:20,176 --> 01:27:22,675
Don't worry,
he's in safe hands.

1478
01:27:22,677 --> 01:27:24,646
I will certainly
tell him you called.

1479
01:27:25,913 --> 01:27:27,015
Cheers.

1480
01:27:42,530 --> 01:27:44,865
Freddie, it's really great.

1481
01:27:44,867 --> 01:27:45,935
It's shit!

1482
01:27:48,236 --> 01:27:49,301
Just leave it.

1483
01:27:49,303 --> 01:27:50,370
<i>Yeah,
hang on one second.</i>

1484
01:27:51,641 --> 01:27:53,706
Give it more treble.

1485
01:27:57,079 --> 01:27:59,345
<i>Where is he? Is he
there? I wanna speak to him.</i>

1486
01:27:59,347 --> 01:28:01,247
He is working himself
to the bone.

1487
01:28:01,249 --> 01:28:03,683
I'm blue in the face trying
to get him to take a break.

1488
01:28:03,685 --> 01:28:04,850
<i>Paul, listen to me.</i>

1489
01:28:04,852 --> 01:28:06,819
<i>It's one performance
for a good cause.</i>

1490
01:28:06,821 --> 01:28:09,490
It's a televised concert
for the famine in Ethiopia.

1491
01:28:09,492 --> 01:28:11,224
<i>They're gonna have
simultaneous performances</i>

1492
01:28:11,226 --> 01:28:12,559
in Philadelphia and London.

1493
01:28:12,561 --> 01:28:14,560
There's gonna be
a billion people watching.

1494
01:28:14,562 --> 01:28:15,828
<i>Queen should be part of it.</i>

1495
01:28:15,830 --> 01:28:16,996
<i>He's just been
really focused.</i>

1496
01:28:16,998 --> 01:28:18,533
<i>But I'll be sure
to pass it on.</i>

1497
01:28:19,836 --> 01:28:21,503
Sure you will.

1498
01:29:25,434 --> 01:29:26,499
Hi.

1499
01:29:26,501 --> 01:29:28,937
Hi.
Come in, come in.

1500
01:29:30,672 --> 01:29:32,773
Why did you
come all this way?

1501
01:29:32,775 --> 01:29:34,541
I just haven't heard
from you in so long,

1502
01:29:34,543 --> 01:29:36,576
and I phoned and phoned,
and then...

1503
01:29:36,578 --> 01:29:38,045
last night I just had
this terrible dream

1504
01:29:38,047 --> 01:29:40,514
that something bad
had happened.

1505
01:29:40,516 --> 01:29:43,015
No, no.
I've been working, that's all.

1506
01:29:43,017 --> 01:29:46,385
Freddie, you're burning
the candle at both ends.

1507
01:29:46,387 --> 01:29:48,089
Yes, but the glow
is so divine.

1508
01:29:52,494 --> 01:29:53,926
Being human
is a condition

1509
01:29:53,928 --> 01:29:56,798
that requires
a little anesthesia.

1510
01:29:57,932 --> 01:30:00,134
- I miss you.
- I miss you.

1511
01:30:00,136 --> 01:30:02,035
I miss you so much.

1512
01:30:02,037 --> 01:30:04,640
Listen, but I have to finish
the second album.

1513
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:06,642
I need you.

1514
01:30:07,275 --> 01:30:09,542
Stay. Stay here with me.

1515
01:30:09,544 --> 01:30:11,247
Just you and me.

1516
01:30:12,446 --> 01:30:13,949
I need the love of my life.

1517
01:30:18,354 --> 01:30:19,355
Freddie...

1518
01:30:20,087 --> 01:30:21,587
What about Queen?

1519
01:30:21,589 --> 01:30:22,855
Jim told me he's been trying

1520
01:30:22,857 --> 01:30:24,424
to contact you
about Live Aid...

1521
01:30:24,426 --> 01:30:26,294
and you won't
take his calls.

1522
01:30:27,596 --> 01:30:28,931
What is Live Aid?

1523
01:30:30,431 --> 01:30:31,666
You haven't heard?

1524
01:30:32,501 --> 01:30:33,767
Freddie,
it's the biggest concert

1525
01:30:33,769 --> 01:30:36,001
there's ever been
or ever will be.

1526
01:30:36,003 --> 01:30:37,871
It's for the famine
in Africa.

1527
01:30:37,873 --> 01:30:40,307
Well, perhaps Paul thought
it wasn't a good idea.

1528
01:30:40,309 --> 01:30:41,675
A distraction from my work.

1529
01:30:41,677 --> 01:30:44,044
That's what's important,
that I finish this album.

1530
01:30:44,046 --> 01:30:46,545
Stay with me, darling,
and I'll be all right.

1531
01:30:46,547 --> 01:30:47,813
Freddie,
I can't stay with you.

1532
01:30:47,815 --> 01:30:50,282
Of course you can.
I need you, Mary.

1533
01:30:50,284 --> 01:30:52,120
Freddie, I'm pregnant.

1534
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:06,935
How could you?

1535
01:31:08,235 --> 01:31:10,006
How could I?

1536
01:31:11,140 --> 01:31:13,406
Freddie, this has nothing
to do with you.

1537
01:31:13,408 --> 01:31:14,541
Come on. Let's get in.

1538
01:31:14,543 --> 01:31:16,209
I bought some nibbles.

1539
01:31:16,211 --> 01:31:17,410
Freddie.

1540
01:31:17,412 --> 01:31:19,115
Sorry we're late.

1541
01:31:19,914 --> 01:31:20,915
Mary.

1542
01:31:21,949 --> 01:31:24,086
What a pleasant surprise.

1543
01:31:25,686 --> 01:31:28,420
Hans. Everyone, come in.

1544
01:31:28,422 --> 01:31:30,025
Milan,
make our guests comfortable.

1545
01:31:33,128 --> 01:31:36,263
I wish I knew
you were coming to stay.

1546
01:31:36,265 --> 01:31:37,863
I'd have scrubbed the place.

1547
01:31:37,865 --> 01:31:39,765
Actually, I'm not staying.

1548
01:31:39,767 --> 01:31:42,238
Wait. Mary, wait. Don't go.

1549
01:31:44,573 --> 01:31:46,742
You told me
you had a dream.

1550
01:31:47,743 --> 01:31:49,211
What was it?

1551
01:31:50,412 --> 01:31:53,249
I was trying
to talk to you, but...

1552
01:31:54,015 --> 01:31:56,515
it was like
talking to my father.

1553
01:31:56,517 --> 01:31:58,953
You needed
to tell me something...

1554
01:31:59,922 --> 01:32:01,824
but you couldn't say it.

1555
01:32:03,357 --> 01:32:05,994
Because you had no voice.

1556
01:32:09,464 --> 01:32:12,832
Freddie, come and
say hello to our new guests.

1557
01:32:12,834 --> 01:32:15,068
They're dying to meet you.

1558
01:32:15,070 --> 01:32:17,406
He'll be one second.

1559
01:32:19,074 --> 01:32:20,075
Mary!

1560
01:32:30,918 --> 01:32:33,288
I'm happy for you, Mary.

1561
01:32:34,756 --> 01:32:36,392
Truly, I am.

1562
01:32:41,262 --> 01:32:42,464
It's just...

1563
01:32:44,732 --> 01:32:46,465
I'm frightened.

1564
01:32:46,467 --> 01:32:49,135
Freddie,
you don't need to be.

1565
01:32:49,137 --> 01:32:52,538
Because no matter what,
you are loved.

1566
01:32:52,540 --> 01:32:55,341
By me, by Brian,
Deacy, Roger...

1567
01:32:55,343 --> 01:32:56,912
your family.

1568
01:32:58,579 --> 01:33:00,415
It's enough.

1569
01:33:01,516 --> 01:33:03,883
And these people...

1570
01:33:03,885 --> 01:33:06,920
they don't care about you.

1571
01:33:06,922 --> 01:33:09,391
Paul doesn't care about you.

1572
01:33:10,691 --> 01:33:13,294
You don't belong here,
Freddie.

1573
01:33:15,230 --> 01:33:16,799
Come home.

1574
01:33:21,203 --> 01:33:22,838
Home.

1575
01:33:46,194 --> 01:33:47,495
Freddie!

1576
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:53,803
What are you doing?
You'll catch your death.

1577
01:33:54,703 --> 01:33:57,506
Why didn't you tell me
about Live Aid?

1578
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:01,577
The Africa charity gig?

1579
01:34:02,578 --> 01:34:04,544
It'll be an embarrassment.

1580
01:34:04,546 --> 01:34:06,115
I didn't wanna
waste your time.

1581
01:34:10,017 --> 01:34:11,850
You should have told me.

1582
01:34:11,852 --> 01:34:13,321
Of course I did.

1583
01:34:14,155 --> 01:34:15,221
You forgot.

1584
01:34:15,223 --> 01:34:17,857
You're always
forgetting things.

1585
01:34:17,859 --> 01:34:19,595
Come in now
and have a drink.

1586
01:34:23,931 --> 01:34:25,266
You're out.

1587
01:34:25,967 --> 01:34:27,169
What do you mean?

1588
01:34:28,869 --> 01:34:31,406
I want you out of my life.

1589
01:34:34,742 --> 01:34:35,975
'Cause I'm the only one left,

1590
01:34:35,977 --> 01:34:37,245
you're blaming me
for everything?

1591
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:40,348
I blame myself.

1592
01:34:41,749 --> 01:34:43,185
So I'm out?

1593
01:34:43,784 --> 01:34:45,253
Just like that?

1594
01:34:46,287 --> 01:34:48,857
After everything
we've been through?

1595
01:34:50,626 --> 01:34:52,994
Just think of
the photos I have.

1596
01:34:53,927 --> 01:34:56,865
I know who you are,
Freddie Mercury.

1597
01:34:59,935 --> 01:35:03,038
You know when
you know you've gone rotten?

1598
01:35:05,373 --> 01:35:06,876
Really rotten?

1599
01:35:08,944 --> 01:35:10,412
Fruit flies.

1600
01:35:11,546 --> 01:35:15,247
Dirty little fruit flies.

1601
01:35:15,249 --> 01:35:18,117
Coming to feast
on what's left.

1602
01:35:18,119 --> 01:35:21,557
Well, there isn't much left
for you to feast on anymore.

1603
01:35:23,891 --> 01:35:25,258
So, fly off.

1604
01:35:25,260 --> 01:35:29,562
Do what you like with your
photographs and your stories.

1605
01:35:29,564 --> 01:35:32,301
But promise me one thing.

1606
01:35:33,334 --> 01:35:35,604
That I never see
your face again.

1607
01:35:36,838 --> 01:35:38,207
Ever.

1608
01:35:39,473 --> 01:35:40,476
I didn't mean it.

1609
01:35:42,944 --> 01:35:45,147
I'm sorry!
Freddie, come back!

1610
01:35:46,047 --> 01:35:47,950
I'll make it better.

1611
01:36:03,198 --> 01:36:04,697
<i>But, Peter,
you might be right.</i>

1612
01:36:04,699 --> 01:36:05,965
<i>I'm not even hurt</i>

1613
01:36:05,967 --> 01:36:07,267
<i>by the fact that
he's let me go as a friend.</i>

1614
01:36:07,269 --> 01:36:09,969
<i>But you can only be there
so much for a person.</i>

1615
01:36:09,971 --> 01:36:11,638
<i>And so, Mr. Prenter...</i>

1616
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:12,505
<i>all these stories</i>

1617
01:36:12,507 --> 01:36:15,541
<i>about Freddie Mercury
and his lovers...</i>

1618
01:36:15,543 --> 01:36:17,178
<i>that there were so many.</i>

1619
01:36:17,712 --> 01:36:19,011
<i>Yeah?</i>

1620
01:36:19,013 --> 01:36:21,013
- <i>Is it really true?</i>
- <i>Yes, it is.</i>

1621
01:36:21,015 --> 01:36:22,682
<i>His lovers were countless.</i>

1622
01:36:22,684 --> 01:36:24,386
<i>Genuinely countless. Uh...</i>

1623
01:36:25,287 --> 01:36:28,987
<i>All these wild,
drug-fueled parties...</i>

1624
01:36:28,989 --> 01:36:32,425
<i>where he'd find
another lover every night...</i>

1625
01:36:32,427 --> 01:36:34,661
<i>and a routine
he couldn't get out of.</i>

1626
01:36:34,663 --> 01:36:36,563
<i>So, you really
did see behind the mask?</i>

1627
01:36:36,565 --> 01:36:39,299
<i>I knew Freddie when
he did</i> Bohemian Rhapsody.

1628
01:36:39,301 --> 01:36:41,901
<i>And the Freddie we have now...</i>

1629
01:36:41,903 --> 01:36:43,969
<i>he doesn't have
the same passion about music.</i>

1630
01:36:45,906 --> 01:36:47,208
Hello?

1631
01:36:49,311 --> 01:36:50,312
Hello?

1632
01:36:50,779 --> 01:36:51,981
Miami?

1633
01:36:52,946 --> 01:36:54,014
Freddie?

1634
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:55,081
<i>How are you?</i>

1635
01:36:55,083 --> 01:36:57,817
There was
this Africa concert...

1636
01:36:57,819 --> 01:36:59,751
that wants Queen to play.

1637
01:36:59,753 --> 01:37:01,420
<i>Is that still...</i>

1638
01:37:01,422 --> 01:37:02,554
You mean Live Aid?

1639
01:37:02,556 --> 01:37:04,791
<i>They've announced
all the bands, Freddie.</i>

1640
01:37:04,793 --> 01:37:06,495
<i>It's too late.</i>

1641
01:37:07,695 --> 01:37:09,161
I need...

1642
01:37:09,163 --> 01:37:11,697
I need to reconnect
with the mothership.

1643
01:37:11,699 --> 01:37:14,000
Freddie, they don't want
anything to do with you.

1644
01:37:14,002 --> 01:37:16,271
<i>They're still very upset.</i>

1645
01:37:17,004 --> 01:37:19,005
Maybe if you ask them...

1646
01:37:19,007 --> 01:37:20,372
<i>they would meet me.</i>

1647
01:37:20,374 --> 01:37:22,477
<i>Tell them I want to talk.</i>

1648
01:37:23,311 --> 01:37:24,577
Just talk.

1649
01:37:28,717 --> 01:37:30,419
We're family.

1650
01:37:33,555 --> 01:37:35,057
You know, family...

1651
01:37:36,024 --> 01:37:37,693
have fights...

1652
01:37:39,660 --> 01:37:41,296
all the time.

1653
01:37:41,796 --> 01:37:43,332
I can call.

1654
01:37:43,864 --> 01:37:45,300
Thank you...

1655
01:37:47,267 --> 01:37:48,233
Jim.

1656
01:37:48,235 --> 01:37:50,136
<i>As this friend,
somebody who...</i>

1657
01:37:50,138 --> 01:37:53,005
<i>probably knows Freddie Mercury
better than anybody else...</i>

1658
01:37:53,007 --> 01:37:56,512
<i>how would you describe him
inside as a person?</i>

1659
01:37:57,512 --> 01:37:59,478
<i>For me,
Freddie will always be...</i>

1660
01:37:59,480 --> 01:38:02,113
<i>this frightened
little Pakkie boy...</i>

1661
01:38:02,115 --> 01:38:04,149
<i>who's afraid to be alone.</i>

1662
01:38:04,151 --> 01:38:05,484
<i>I hope he sees this</i>

1663
01:38:05,486 --> 01:38:07,653
<i>and realizes
what he has lost in you.</i>

1664
01:38:07,655 --> 01:38:09,121
<i>I hope he does, too.</i>

1665
01:38:09,123 --> 01:38:11,526
<i>A close and important friend.</i>

1666
01:38:27,542 --> 01:38:29,078
Where are they?

1667
01:38:29,677 --> 01:38:31,145
They're late.

1668
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:39,852
Hi, guys.

1669
01:38:39,854 --> 01:38:41,155
Jim.

1670
01:38:43,057 --> 01:38:44,957
If anybody wants
any tea, coffee...

1671
01:38:44,959 --> 01:38:46,360
bladed weapons...

1672
01:38:47,695 --> 01:38:49,131
just ask.

1673
01:38:50,832 --> 01:38:51,834
So...

1674
01:38:53,267 --> 01:38:54,599
who wants to go first?

1675
01:38:54,601 --> 01:38:55,770
I'll start.

1676
01:38:57,672 --> 01:38:59,205
I've been hideous.

1677
01:38:59,207 --> 01:39:01,340
I know that, and...

1678
01:39:01,342 --> 01:39:02,778
I deserve your fury.

1679
01:39:03,878 --> 01:39:05,247
I've been conceited...

1680
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:08,350
selfish.

1681
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:13,786
Well, an asshole, basically.

1682
01:39:13,788 --> 01:39:15,156
Strong beginning.

1683
01:39:16,490 --> 01:39:18,491
Look, I'm happy to
strip off my shirt...

1684
01:39:18,493 --> 01:39:20,796
and flagellate myself
before you.

1685
01:39:23,597 --> 01:39:26,031
Or rather, I could ask you
a simple question.

1686
01:39:26,033 --> 01:39:27,369
I'm good
with the flagellation.

1687
01:39:32,172 --> 01:39:34,941
What's it gonna take
for you all to forgive me?

1688
01:39:34,943 --> 01:39:36,845
Is that what you want,
Freddie?

1689
01:39:38,180 --> 01:39:39,312
I forgive you.

1690
01:39:39,314 --> 01:39:41,182
- Is that it? Can we go now?
- No.

1691
01:39:47,154 --> 01:39:48,853
I went to Munich.

1692
01:39:48,855 --> 01:39:50,557
I hired a bunch of guys.

1693
01:39:50,559 --> 01:39:52,825
I told them exactly
what I wanted them to do...

1694
01:39:52,827 --> 01:39:54,262
and the problem was...

1695
01:39:57,097 --> 01:39:58,332
they did it.

1696
01:40:00,101 --> 01:40:02,471
No pushback from Roger.

1697
01:40:03,971 --> 01:40:05,640
None of your rewrites.

1698
01:40:06,341 --> 01:40:08,209
None of his funny looks.

1699
01:40:12,747 --> 01:40:14,249
I need you.

1700
01:40:17,852 --> 01:40:19,453
And you need me.

1701
01:40:23,824 --> 01:40:25,057
Let's face it.

1702
01:40:25,059 --> 01:40:26,794
We're not bad
for four aging queens.

1703
01:40:29,230 --> 01:40:31,264
So, um, go ahead.

1704
01:40:31,266 --> 01:40:33,235
Name your terms.

1705
01:40:34,668 --> 01:40:36,939
Could you give us a moment,
please, Fred?

1706
01:40:53,354 --> 01:40:54,920
Why'd you do that?

1707
01:40:54,922 --> 01:40:56,925
I just felt like it.

1708
01:41:08,903 --> 01:41:11,673
They'll be all right.
They just need a bit of time.

1709
01:41:13,473 --> 01:41:15,510
What if I don't have time?

1710
01:41:17,945 --> 01:41:19,748
What do you mean, Fred?

1711
01:41:25,552 --> 01:41:27,722
You can come back in now,
if you'd like.

1712
01:41:33,860 --> 01:41:34,863
We decided...

1713
01:41:36,263 --> 01:41:37,466
What did we decide?

1714
01:41:37,999 --> 01:41:39,331
From now on...

1715
01:41:39,333 --> 01:41:42,902
every song, no matter
who wrote it, music, lyrics...

1716
01:41:42,904 --> 01:41:44,403
it's by Queen.

1717
01:41:44,405 --> 01:41:46,906
Not one of us, just Queen.

1718
01:41:46,908 --> 01:41:48,808
All the money,
all the credits,

1719
01:41:48,810 --> 01:41:50,710
split four ways evenly.

1720
01:41:50,712 --> 01:41:51,943
Done.

1721
01:41:51,945 --> 01:41:54,145
We have a problem
with the people around you.

1722
01:41:54,147 --> 01:41:55,548
Paul is out.
I fired him.

1723
01:41:55,550 --> 01:41:57,883
- On what pretext?
- Villainy.

1724
01:41:57,885 --> 01:41:59,184
What else?

1725
01:41:59,186 --> 01:42:00,353
Bob Geldof.

1726
01:42:00,355 --> 01:42:02,421
I called to convince him
to squeeze you guys

1727
01:42:02,423 --> 01:42:04,357
into the lineup
for the Live Aid concert...

1728
01:42:04,359 --> 01:42:06,326
but he wants an answer now.

1729
01:42:06,328 --> 01:42:08,430
You have to make a decision.

1730
01:42:09,864 --> 01:42:11,430
Every ticket's already sold.

1731
01:42:11,432 --> 01:42:13,332
100,000 people at Wembley...

1732
01:42:13,334 --> 01:42:16,568
100,000 people at
JFK Stadium in Philadelphia...

1733
01:42:16,570 --> 01:42:20,206
a global TV audience around
the world of 150 countries...

1734
01:42:20,208 --> 01:42:22,041
13 satellites.

1735
01:42:22,043 --> 01:42:25,178
The Olympics only had three.

1736
01:42:25,180 --> 01:42:27,212
We haven't
played together in years.

1737
01:42:27,214 --> 01:42:28,714
It's kinda suicide
to play again...

1738
01:42:28,716 --> 01:42:30,582
for the first time
in front of millions.

1739
01:42:30,584 --> 01:42:33,587
Try over 1.5 billion.

1740
01:42:34,489 --> 01:42:37,255
"Who are
these four dinosaurs?"

1741
01:42:37,257 --> 01:42:38,758
"Where's Madonna?"

1742
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:41,363
It's a 20-minute set.
Everyone gets the same.

1743
01:42:41,863 --> 01:42:43,865
Jagger, Bowie...

1744
01:42:44,731 --> 01:42:46,198
Elton...

1745
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:49,035
McCartney, The Who...

1746
01:42:49,037 --> 01:42:50,569
Led Zeppelin...

1747
01:42:50,571 --> 01:42:53,475
Phil Collins,
REO Speedwagon...

1748
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:55,841
Bob Dylan.

1749
01:42:55,843 --> 01:42:56,910
Certainly good company.

1750
01:42:56,912 --> 01:42:59,077
Anybody who is anybody
is doing this concert.

1751
01:42:59,079 --> 01:43:00,345
Look.

1752
01:43:00,347 --> 01:43:01,848
All I know...

1753
01:43:01,850 --> 01:43:05,787
is that if we wake up
the day after this concert...

1754
01:43:06,387 --> 01:43:08,723
and we didn't do our part...

1755
01:43:09,958 --> 01:43:12,928
we're going to regret it
till the day we die.

1756
01:43:20,001 --> 01:43:21,436
Please.

1757
01:43:28,476 --> 01:43:30,242
<i>Every day, in San Francisco,</i>

1758
01:43:30,244 --> 01:43:32,277
<i>two more men
hear the grim news...</i>

1759
01:43:32,279 --> 01:43:33,946
<i>"You have AIDS,
there's no cure."</i>

1760
01:43:33,948 --> 01:43:35,814
<i>Since doctors
in France and America</i>

1761
01:43:35,816 --> 01:43:37,883
<i>isolated the virus in 1983...</i>

1762
01:43:37,885 --> 01:43:40,585
<i>research has proceeded
at a frantic pace.</i>

1763
01:43:40,587 --> 01:43:42,287
<i>The method used by the virus</i>

1764
01:43:42,289 --> 01:43:44,223
<i>to destroy
the body's immune system...</i>

1765

Do you understand?

1780
01:45:00,935 --> 01:45:06,404
The way we go from here is
that treatments are available.

1781
01:45:06,406 --> 01:45:09,144
They're not particularly
effective, Freddie.

1782
01:45:35,235 --> 01:45:36,904
Eh-oh!

1783
01:45:45,913 --> 01:45:47,947
Eh-oh.

1784
01:46:21,882 --> 01:46:22,883
Yep.

1785
01:46:23,383 --> 01:46:24,683
Mmm-hmm.

1786
01:46:24,685 --> 01:46:26,087
- Let's call it. Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

1787
01:46:27,154 --> 01:46:28,188
Sorry.

1788
01:46:29,089 --> 01:46:30,091
I sound like shit.

1789
01:46:31,592 --> 01:46:34,095
You all are lovely,
you sound good.

1790
01:46:34,930 --> 01:46:36,495
Been a while.

1791
01:46:36,497 --> 01:46:38,598
My throat feels like
a vulture's crotch.

1792
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:40,633
We still got a week.

1793
01:46:40,635 --> 01:46:41,800
We'll get there.

1794
01:46:41,802 --> 01:46:43,702
Yeah, we're in
a good place, Fred.

1795
01:46:43,704 --> 01:46:45,774
You just need a bit of rest,
that's all.

1796
01:46:46,940 --> 01:46:47,943
Yeah.

1797
01:46:48,476 --> 01:46:49,642
Get a drink, Rog?

1798
01:46:49,644 --> 01:46:50,809
Yeah,
there's a nice little pub

1799
01:46:50,811 --> 01:46:52,711
- down the road, actually.
- Can I come?

1800
01:46:52,713 --> 01:46:53,778
We're just an exclusive...

1801
01:46:53,780 --> 01:46:55,648
No, of course not.
Invite-only.

1802
01:46:55,650 --> 01:46:56,715
Yeah,
that's kind of you.

1803
01:46:56,717 --> 01:46:58,286
Before you leave...

1804
01:47:00,520 --> 01:47:02,587
Could I have a second?

1805
01:47:02,589 --> 01:47:04,626
Yeah. What's up?

1806
01:47:07,461 --> 01:47:08,997
I've got it.

1807
01:47:10,899 --> 01:47:12,133
Got what?

1808
01:47:13,066 --> 01:47:14,234
AIDS.

1809
01:47:16,303 --> 01:47:18,672
I wanted you to
hear it from me.

1810
01:47:19,908 --> 01:47:21,773
Fred, I'm so sorry.

1811
01:47:21,775 --> 01:47:23,341
Brian, stop.

1812
01:47:23,343 --> 01:47:24,712
Don't.

1813
01:47:27,248 --> 01:47:29,415
For right now...

1814
01:47:29,417 --> 01:47:30,550
it's between us.

1815
01:47:30,552 --> 01:47:32,687
All right? Just us.

1816
01:47:33,320 --> 01:47:34,955
So, please...

1817
01:47:35,722 --> 01:47:37,822
if any of you...

1818
01:47:37,824 --> 01:47:41,693
fuss about it or frown
about it, or, worst of all...

1819
01:47:41,695 --> 01:47:43,962
if you bore me
with your sympathy...

1820
01:47:43,964 --> 01:47:46,031
that's just seconds wasted.

1821
01:47:46,033 --> 01:47:48,867
Seconds that could be used
making music...

1822
01:47:48,869 --> 01:47:51,737
which is all I want to do
with the time I have left.

1823
01:47:51,739 --> 01:47:54,807
I don't have time
to be their victim...

1824
01:47:54,809 --> 01:47:58,277
their AIDS poster boy,
their cautionary tale.

1825
01:47:58,279 --> 01:48:01,082
No, I decide who I am.

1826
01:48:02,182 --> 01:48:05,252
I'm going to be
what I was born to be.

1827
01:48:06,553 --> 01:48:08,754
A performer...

1828
01:48:08,756 --> 01:48:11,392
who gives the people
what they want.

1829
01:48:15,762 --> 01:48:18,232
Touch of the heavens.

1830
01:48:21,334 --> 01:48:23,672
Freddie fucking Mercury.

1831
01:48:25,739 --> 01:48:27,876
You're a legend, Fred.

1832
01:48:30,610 --> 01:48:33,245
You're bloody right I am.

1833
01:48:33,247 --> 01:48:35,648
We're all legends.

1834
01:48:35,650 --> 01:48:37,383
But you're right,
I am a legend.

1835
01:48:37,385 --> 01:48:39,218
Now, you give me a chance

1836
01:48:39,220 --> 01:48:41,923
to get my bitchy little
vocal cords in order...

1837
01:48:43,489 --> 01:48:44,857
and we'll go and punch a hole

1838
01:48:44,859 --> 01:48:46,928
through the roof
of that stadium.

1839
01:48:48,529 --> 01:48:50,496
Actually,
Wembley doesn't have a roof.

1840
01:48:51,932 --> 01:48:54,700
- All right.
- No, he's right. It doesn't.

1841
01:48:54,702 --> 01:48:57,204
Then we'll punch a hole
in the sky.

1842
01:49:02,443 --> 01:49:04,809
Now, even though you're crying
like three little girls...

1843
01:49:04,811 --> 01:49:06,045
I still love you.

1844
01:49:06,047 --> 01:49:07,179
- All right, enough of this.
- All right.

1845
01:49:07,181 --> 01:49:08,581
- Drink?
- Yes!

1846
01:49:08,583 --> 01:49:09,784
Or ten?

1847
01:49:26,234 --> 01:49:27,736
What are you looking at?

1848
01:49:28,901 --> 01:49:30,504
You think
you could do better?

1849
01:49:32,506 --> 01:49:33,639
Everyone's a critic.

1850
01:49:33,641 --> 01:49:35,307
<i>It's 12:00 noon in London.</i>

1851
01:49:35,309 --> 01:49:37,076
<i>7:00 a.m. in Philadelphia.</i>

1852
01:49:37,078 --> 01:49:39,944
<i>And around the world,
it's time for Live Aid.</i>

1853
01:49:39,946 --> 01:49:41,313
<i>If you have
credit cards...</i>

1854
01:49:41,315 --> 01:49:42,947
<i>you can phone up with
the number you want to give.</i>

1855
01:49:42,949 --> 01:49:45,151
<i>But you can also pledge cash,
and it's very important.</i>

1856
01:49:45,153 --> 01:49:46,885
There is not enough money
coming in...

1857
01:49:46,887 --> 01:49:48,519
and all these people
are not playing

1858
01:49:48,521 --> 01:49:49,889
for the good of their health.

1859
01:49:49,891 --> 01:49:51,756
They're playing for the good
of other people's health.

1860
01:49:51,758 --> 01:49:53,559
So get your money out now!

1861
01:49:53,561 --> 01:49:55,359
And phone up
and give us the money.

1862
01:49:55,361 --> 01:49:57,763
You've got plenty of it,
or if you got none of it...

1863
01:49:57,765 --> 01:49:59,965
get it to people
who are dying of starvation.

1864
01:49:59,967 --> 01:50:02,835
We want to get a million
pounds out of this country.

1865
01:50:02,837 --> 01:50:05,504
<i>On the telephone,
before 10:00 tonight.</i>

1866
01:50:24,024 --> 01:50:26,090
Do you have any idea...

1867
01:50:26,092 --> 01:50:29,228
how many Jim Huttons
there are in London?

1868
01:50:29,230 --> 01:50:31,596
Well, I didn't want to make it
too easy for you.

1869
01:50:33,534 --> 01:50:36,100
How have you been, Freddie?

1870
01:50:36,102 --> 01:50:38,338
I've been a bit lost,
to be honest.

1871
01:50:38,940 --> 01:50:40,639
You were right.

1872
01:50:40,641 --> 01:50:42,310
I could do with a friend.

1873
01:50:43,276 --> 01:50:45,344
Would you like
to have tea with me?

1874
01:50:45,346 --> 01:50:46,347
Tea?

1875
01:51:00,026 --> 01:51:02,361
So, Jim,
how do you know Freddie?

1876
01:51:02,363 --> 01:51:04,966
Do you work together?

1877
01:51:15,877 --> 01:51:17,445
Jim's my friend.

1878
01:51:23,150 --> 01:51:24,983
Wonderful to have friends.

1879
01:51:24,985 --> 01:51:27,588
Mithai. Jer made it herself.

1880
01:51:30,490 --> 01:51:31,557
Thank you.

1881
01:51:31,559 --> 01:51:33,559
- Freddie?
- Your favorite, Freddie.

1882
01:51:33,561 --> 01:51:34,792
We have to go, Mum.

1883
01:51:34,794 --> 01:51:35,993
But you just got here, <i>beta.</i>

1884
01:51:35,995 --> 01:51:37,196
What do you mean, "go"?

1885
01:51:37,198 --> 01:51:39,365
We've gotta get to Wembley.

1886
01:51:39,367 --> 01:51:40,866
Would you believe it?

1887
01:51:40,868 --> 01:51:43,301
Jim's never been
to a rock concert.

1888
01:51:43,303 --> 01:51:44,169
That's true.

1889
01:51:44,171 --> 01:51:45,770
Queen are
playing at Live Aid.

1890
01:51:45,772 --> 01:51:46,839
We're all doing our bit

1891
01:51:46,841 --> 01:51:48,674
for the starving children
in Africa...

1892
01:51:48,676 --> 01:51:51,012
and nobody's
taking any money.

1893
01:51:56,117 --> 01:52:00,021
Good thoughts, good words,
good deeds.

1894
01:52:02,155 --> 01:52:04,258
Just like you taught me, Papa.

1895
01:52:19,605 --> 01:52:20,607
Love you, <i>beta.</i>

1896
01:52:21,975 --> 01:52:24,012
Bye, Kash.
Love you, too, Mama.

1897
01:52:27,247 --> 01:52:28,482
In fact...

1898
01:52:29,516 --> 01:52:30,750
I'll blow you a kiss

1899
01:52:30,752 --> 01:52:32,387
when I'm on stage.

1900
01:52:39,659 --> 01:52:41,061
Kashi...

1901
01:52:42,096 --> 01:52:43,932
put on the telly.

1902
01:53:04,818 --> 01:53:06,452
- Hello, Mary!
- Hi, Brian!

1903
01:53:06,454 --> 01:53:08,120
We just came
to wish you good luck.

1904
01:53:08,122 --> 01:53:09,524
Hello, my love.

1905
01:53:11,825 --> 01:53:13,326
Hi.

1906
01:53:13,328 --> 01:53:14,492
Mary, David...

1907
01:53:14,494 --> 01:53:15,928
this is Jim.

1908
01:53:15,930 --> 01:53:17,362
Jim...

1909
01:53:17,364 --> 01:53:18,498
Mary and David.

1910
01:53:19,766 --> 01:53:21,336
It's nice to meet you.

1911
01:53:21,836 --> 01:53:23,503
- Hi.
- Hi.

1912
01:53:24,538 --> 01:53:25,539
I'll see you after.

1913
01:53:28,374 --> 01:53:29,974
I don't think
you're gonna be able to see

1914
01:53:29,976 --> 01:53:31,511
anything from here.
Join them.

1915
01:53:44,391 --> 01:53:47,462
What do we think of David?

1916
01:53:50,964 --> 01:53:52,232
Nice chap.

1917
01:53:54,467 --> 01:53:55,768
I think he's gay.

1918
01:53:57,305 --> 01:53:59,774
<i>We'll be on
in about one minute.</i>

1919
01:54:00,774 --> 01:54:03,077
<i>One, two. One, two.</i>

1920
01:54:03,610 --> 01:54:05,443
That's almost us.

1921
01:54:05,445 --> 01:54:06,778
We ready?

1922
01:54:06,780 --> 01:54:08,679
Feel good?

1923
01:54:08,681 --> 01:54:09,615
<i>So we have had</i>

1924
01:54:09,617 --> 01:54:11,319
<i>a bit of a complaint
about the noise.</i>

1925
01:54:15,355 --> 01:54:17,557
<i>From a woman in Belgium.</i>

1926
01:54:31,038 --> 01:54:32,437
<i>Anyway...</i>

1927
01:54:32,439 --> 01:54:36,474
<i>it gives us enormous pleasure
to introduce the next combo...</i>

1928
01:54:36,476 --> 01:54:37,777

01:54:37,779 --> 01:54:39,080

<i>Her Majesty...</i>

- <i>Queen!</i>
- <i>Check, two, check.</i>

1932
01:54:55,494 --> 01:54:56,497
