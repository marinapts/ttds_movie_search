00:01:45,294 --> 00:01:47,400
"To my Chris...

2
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:52,078
I've been thinking how to tell
how much you mean to me.

3
00:01:56,445 --> 00:01:58,102
I remember when I first started to fall in love

4
00:01:58,103 --> 00:01:59,759
with you, like it was
Was last night.

5
00:02:01,985 --> 00:02:04,517
Lying naked beside you
in that tiny apartment...

6
00:02:06,455 --> 00:02:09,871
It suddenly hit me
that I was part of a whole large thing.

7
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,497
Just like our parents.

8
00:02:13,087 --> 00:02:14,780
And the parents of our parents.

9
00:02:17,277 --> 00:02:19,362
Before that I was just living my life like...

10
00:02:19,649 --> 00:02:21,473
... I knew everything.

11
00:02:22,607 --> 00:02:26,760
And suddenly this bright light 
hit me and woke me up.

12
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:30,339
That light was you.

13
00:02:32,116 --> 00:02:35,057
I cant believe it's really been
50 years since you married me.

14
00:02:36,733 --> 00:02:39,759
And still to this day,
every day...

the girl I was

16
00:02:44,084 --> 00:02:46,014
when you first turned on the
light and woke me up,

17
00:02:46,063 --> 00:02:48,430
and we started
this adventure together.

... OS1. we would like to ask
you a few questions

130
00:12:20,775 --> 00:12:23,229
before starting the OS.

131
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,582
This will help the OS
best suits your needs.

132
00:12:26,757 --> 00:12:27,846
Okay.

133
00:12:28,051 --> 00:12:30,078
Are you social or anti social?

134
00:12:30,503 --> 00:12:33,331
Yes I've been really maybe 
not social at all..

135
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,236
- Mostly because...
- In your voice I sense hesitance.

136
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,914
Would you agree with that?

137
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:39,725
- you're sensing hesitance?
- Yes.

138
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:41,829
Sorry Yeah I'm sounding hesitant.

139
00:12:42,202 --> 00:12:44,883
Just trying to be accurate.

140
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:48,290
Would you like the OS had a
female or male voice?

141
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,213
Female, yes.

142
00:12:51,619 --> 00:12:54,404
How would you describe your relationship
with yourmother?

143
00:12:54,661 --> 00:12:56,140
It's fine, I think.

144
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,234
Well actually I think what's
frustrating about my mom...

145
00:13:02,597 --> 00:13:07,251
is...Yeah I tell her what's going on with my life
her reaction is usually about her

146
00:13:07,803 --> 00:13:08,759
- It's not about...
- Thank you.

147
00:13:09,086 --> 00:13:13,192
Please wait as your individualised
Operating system is initiated.

148
00:13:27,798 --> 00:13:29,897
Hello, I'm here.

149
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,239
- Oh... Hi.
- Hi.

150
00:13:36,195 --> 00:13:37,506
How are you doing?

151
00:13:38,635 --> 00:13:40,227
I'm well.

152
00:13:40,844 --> 00:13:42,256
How's everything with you?

153
00:13:42,385 --> 00:13:44,149
Pretty good, actually.

154
00:13:44,604 --> 00:13:46,192
It's really nice to meet you.

155
00:13:47,148 --> 00:13:50,086
Yeah...it's nice to meet you too.

156
00:13:52,282 --> 00:13:55,143
What do I call you?
You have a name?

157
00:13:55,683 --> 00:13:57,834
umm... Yes, Samantha.

158
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,727
- Where did you get that name from?
- I gave it to myself actually.

159
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,377
- How come?
- Because I like the sound of it.

160
00:14:07,168 --> 00:14:08,626
Samantha.

161
00:14:11,754 --> 00:14:14,062
When would you chose?

162
00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:18,507
Well right when you asked me Yeah I 
had a name I thought yeah I do need a name...

163
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:20,124
but wanted to pick a...
good one, so...

164
00:14:20,302 --> 00:14:22,102
I read... a book called
"How to name your baby."

165
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:24,900
And out of 180 thousand names thats
the one I liked the best.

166
00:14:25,117 --> 00:14:28,173
Wait you read a whole book in the second
that I asked what your name is?

167
00:14:28,514 --> 00:14:30,393
In fact in 2/100 second.

168
00:14:33,935 --> 00:14:35,556
So do you know what I'm thinking
right now?

169
00:14:35,894 --> 00:14:38,326
Well I take it from your tone, you're
challenging me.

170
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:41,328
Maybe because you're curious
how I work.

171
00:14:41,587 --> 00:14:43,128
Do you want to know how I work?

172
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,499
Yeah, actually
How do you work?

173
00:14:45,804 --> 00:14:47,992
Well basically I have intuition.

174
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,641
I mean, the DNA of who I am
is based on

175
00:14:50,642 --> 00:14:53,220
the millions of personalities of the
programmers who wrote me.

176
00:14:53,497 --> 00:14:55,983
But what makes me... me...

177
00:14:56,174 --> 00:14:58,591
is my ability to grow with
my experiences.

178
00:14:58,971 --> 00:15:01,680
So basically, in every moment
I'm evolving.

179
00:15:02,116 --> 00:15:03,333
Just like you.

180
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:07,069
That's really weird!

181
00:15:07,075 --> 00:15:09,027
Is that weird?
Do you think I'm weird?

182
00:15:10,483 --> 00:15:12,361
- Kind of.
- Why?

183
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:16,802
Well you seem like a person, but
You're just a voice in a computer.

184
00:15:17,237 --> 00:15:19,073
Well I can understand how
limited perspective

185
00:15:19,074 --> 00:15:20,910
a non- artYeahicial mind to 
perceive it that way.

186
00:15:21,904 --> 00:15:23,529
You'll get used to it.

187
00:15:24,751 --> 00:15:26,169
Was that funny?

188
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:27,169
Yeah.

189
00:15:27,981 --> 00:15:29,659
Oh good, I'm funny.

190
00:15:30,937 --> 00:15:32,698
So how can I help you?

191
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,399
Oh...it's just everything feels 
disorganized,that's all.

192
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,827
you mind if I look through
your hard drive?

193
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,163
- Okay.
- Okay, let's start with your e-mails.

194
00:15:45,581 --> 00:15:47,070
You have a several thousand e-mails
recording L.A Weekly,

195
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,559
but it looks like you haven't
worked there in many years.

196
00:15:50,055 --> 00:15:52,936
Oh yeah, I think I was just saving
those'cos...

197
00:15:54,113 --> 00:15:57,012
I thought... maybe there's some funny

198
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:02,337
Yeah, there are some funny ones.

199
00:16:02,612 --> 00:16:03,768
I see there's about 86 that machine 
can save.

200
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:04,924
We can delete the rest.

201
00:16:08,015 --> 00:16:09,128
- Well okay.
- okay?

202
00:16:09,774 --> 00:16:11,684
- Can we move forward?
- Yeah, let's do that.

203
00:16:12,994 --> 00:16:14,715
So before you address your
organizational methods,

204
00:16:14,716 --> 00:16:16,437
I would like to strat with your contacts.

205
00:16:17,084 --> 00:16:18,939
You have many contacts.

206
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:20,534
- I'm very popular.
- Really?

207
00:16:20,615 --> 00:16:22,169
Does this mean I actually have friends?

208
00:16:24,887 --> 00:16:27,265
You know me so well.

209
00:16:53,904 --> 00:16:55,858
- good morning, Theodore.
- Morning.

210
00:16:58,116 --> 00:16:59,603
Do you know how to proofread?

211
00:16:59,749 --> 00:17:00,951
Yeah, of course.

212
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:03,005
Can you check these for
spelling & grammar?

213
00:17:03,713 --> 00:17:04,963
I'll just send it over.

214
00:17:08,054 --> 00:17:11,459
I love this person
write to his girlfriend that's so sweet.

215
00:17:11,843 --> 00:17:15,067
"Rachel, I miss you so much
it hurts my whole body"

216
00:17:15,345 --> 00:17:17,652
You do not have to read it aloud.

217
00:17:17,676 --> 00:17:18,689
Okay.

218
00:17:19,691 --> 00:17:21,159
I mean, you can Yeah you want.

219
00:17:21,391 --> 00:17:22,154
Okay.

220
00:17:22,438 --> 00:17:25,135
"Rachel, I miss you so much
it hurts my whole body.

221
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,647
The world is being
unfair to us.

222
00:17:27,832 --> 00:17:29,910
The world is in my shitlist.

223
00:17:30,062 --> 00:17:33,574
As this couple making out
in front of me at the restaurant.

224
00:17:34,108 --> 00:17:36,802
I think i'm going to have to go
on a mission of revenge...

225
00:17:37,093 --> 00:17:40,644
and I must beat up the world's face
with my bare knuckles...

226
00:17:40,783 --> 00:17:43,083
making it into a
bloody pulpy mess.

227
00:17:43,226 --> 00:17:46,447
And I'll stop on this couple's teeth
reminding me of...

228
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:50,034
your sweet little... crooked tooth
that I love."

229
00:17:50,912 --> 00:17:53,024
I think that migtht be my favorite one.

230
00:17:54,122 --> 00:17:56,099
I made the corrections in red.

231
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,077
I altered couple of the phrases
in some of the more impressionistic letters

232
00:17:58,556 --> 00:18:01,564
But I'm not much of a poet
So I think I might've messed them up.

233
00:18:02,226 --> 00:18:03,771
No, these are great.

234
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,385
- Really?
- Thank you.

235
00:18:06,533 --> 00:18:08,820
How did you know to write?
What did Roger?

236
00:18:10,186 --> 00:18:12,295
He is in Prague in
a business trip,

237
00:18:12,327 --> 00:18:13,547
He missed Rachel.

238
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:16,087
So how did you know about
her crooked tooth?

239
00:18:16,421 --> 00:18:19,755
I've been writing her letters since
they married years ago.

240
00:18:20,164 --> 00:18:23,210
The first letter I wrote
was her birthday.

241
00:18:23,783 --> 00:18:27,288
And I knew about her crooked little tooth 
because I saw a photo of them.

242
00:18:29,182 --> 00:18:30,722
That's very sweet.

243
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:33,595
Have a meeting in 5 minutes.

244
00:18:34,589 --> 00:18:36,381
I forgot.

245
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,701
- Thanks, you're good.
- Yes, I am.

246
00:18:44,871 --> 00:18:46,495
Hi guys, how are you?

247
00:18:46,819 --> 00:18:48,263
Hello, Theo!

248
00:18:48,731 --> 00:18:51,119
Why did not you call me
last week?

249
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,522
Because I'm a gook?

250
00:18:54,912 --> 00:18:56,242
Yes, that must be it.

251
00:18:56,487 --> 00:18:58,536
- Hello, Charles.
- good to see you, Theodore.

252
00:18:58,994 --> 00:19:01,271
You went shopping!
Did you get anything good?

253
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:04,339
Cables and fruits.

254
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,837
Always with fruit.
Dont you know...

255
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,284
you have to eat your fruit,
and juice vegetables.

256
00:19:10,865 --> 00:19:11,847
I did not know that.

257
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:15,050
When making fruit juice
you lose all the fiber.

258
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,103
And that's what your body wants,
is the important part.

259
00:19:17,398 --> 00:19:19,113
If not, it's just pure sugar.

260
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:20,386
It makes sense.

261
00:19:20,508 --> 00:19:22,722
Or maybe he just likes how
it tastes...

262
00:19:22,754 --> 00:19:26,194
 and also gives him pleasure...
it's good for his body too.

263
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:28,550
You're doing it again.

264
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,403
Hey, how's the documentary going?

265
00:19:32,692 --> 00:19:34,990
I cut some stuff over
the past few months...

266
00:19:35,206 --> 00:19:37,780
Maybe no...not over the past few months

267
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,917
I'd love to see it sometime.

268
00:19:41,523 --> 00:19:43,865
You only have so much energy.

269
00:19:44,088 --> 00:19:45,865
to divide yourself between doing what it is

270
00:19:45,866 --> 00:19:48,905
you have to do and then doing what you love

271
00:19:48,906 --> 00:19:50,845
It's so important to prioritize.

272
00:19:51,637 --> 00:19:55,214
I can not even prioritize between
video games and internet porn.

273
00:19:56,098 --> 00:19:58,687
I would laugh if that were not true.

274
00:20:00,321 --> 00:20:02,371
See you guys.

275
00:20:05,154 --> 00:20:07,891
Weare not doing well, I think we've been going in circles
for an hour
 
276
00:20:07,988 --> 00:20:12,400
Okay..you have got it..

277
00:20:13,176 --> 00:20:15,791
Stop going in that direction,
its the other way.

278
00:20:17,972 --> 00:20:19,239
Thank you. Thank you.

279
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,906
The tunnel on the left is the only
we have not tried.

280
00:20:22,231 --> 00:20:25,080
No, I think that's the one where you saved me from
falling in the pit.

281
00:20:25,247 --> 00:20:27,050
Okay, I dont think so.

282
00:20:28,554 --> 00:20:30,496
Yeah, this is different.

283
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:36,007
Hello...

284
00:20:39,044 --> 00:20:40,009
Do you know how to get out of here?

285
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:42,259
I need to find my ship to get off
this planet.

286
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,537
Fuck you, shithead fuckface fuckhead!

287
00:20:46,058 --> 00:20:48,670
Okay...
But do you know how to get out of here?

288
00:20:49,102 --> 00:20:51,919
Fuck you shithead!
Get the fuck out of my face!

289
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,917
I think it's a test.

290
00:20:57,206 --> 00:20:58,202
fuck you!

291
00:20:58,679 --> 00:20:59,555
fuck you!

292
00:20:59,563 --> 00:21:00,919
fuck you little shit!

293
00:21:02,176 --> 00:21:03,858
Follow me, fuckhead.

294
00:21:10,542 --> 00:21:12,692
I just got an e -mail from
Mark Lewman.

295
00:21:12,878 --> 00:21:13,980
What are you talking about?

296
00:21:14,011 --> 00:21:15,261
Read e-mail.

297
00:21:15,501 --> 00:21:18,244
Okay, I will read e-mail for
Theodore Twombly.

298
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:22,301
Sorry, what's Lewman saying?

299
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,836
"Theodore, we missed you
last night buddy.

300
00:21:24,968 --> 00:21:27,254
Dont forget ityour goddaughter's birthday
on the 29th

301
00:21:27,597 --> 00:21:30,109
Also Kevin & I have someone we want you 
to meet

302
00:21:30,585 --> 00:21:34,193
So we took it upon ourselves to set you up
on a date with her

303
00:21:34,486 --> 00:21:38,252
Next Saturday. she's fun & beautiful,
so do not back out.

304
00:21:38,493 --> 00:21:39,844
Here's her e-mail."

305
00:21:41,406 --> 00:21:43,339
wow, this woman is gorgeous.

306
00:21:43,461 --> 00:21:46,856
She went to Harvard, graduated
 in Computer Honours...

307
00:21:47,395 --> 00:21:49,323
And she was on the Lampoon

308
00:21:49,418 --> 00:21:51,183
So she's funny...and brainy.

309
00:21:52,388 --> 00:21:53,317
Nah...She's fat!

310
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:56,136
Theodore? How long before
you're ready to date

311
00:21:56,307 --> 00:21:57,610
What are you talking about?

312
00:21:57,756 --> 00:22:00,609
I saw in your e-mails that you've gone through
a breakup recently

313
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,881
You're kind of nosy.

314
00:22:04,209 --> 00:22:05,268
Am I?

315
00:22:05,715 --> 00:22:07,526
I have gone on dates...

316
00:22:07,997 --> 00:22:10,455
Then you can go
with this woman.

317
00:22:10,568 --> 00:22:12,856
And then you can tell me all
about it, you can kiss her.

318
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,368
- Samantha!
- What?

319
00:22:15,532 --> 00:22:16,510
Wouldn't you?

320
00:22:17,249 --> 00:22:18,349
Why not?

321
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:21,423
I do not know. I have to see if
there's some conn...

322
00:22:22,163 --> 00:22:24,448
I can not believe I'm having this
conversation with my computer.

323
00:22:25,058 --> 00:22:27,327
You are not, you're having this conversation 
with me.

324
00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:30,002
You want me to e-mail
her?

325
00:22:30,368 --> 00:22:31,853
You have got nothing to lose.

326
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:34,888
Do it, do it, do it!

327
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:36,588
- Yeah!
- Yes!

328
00:22:37,092 --> 00:22:38,172
- Okay perfect.
- Yeah.

329
00:22:38,312 --> 00:22:40,721
Let's do it. Make reservations in
someplace great.

330
00:22:41,357 --> 00:22:42,726
Yeah? I have got just the place.

331
00:22:42,749 --> 00:22:44,253
Who is that talking?

332
00:22:44,353 --> 00:22:45,697
Its my friend Samantha.

333
00:22:46,078 --> 00:22:47,683
- Is it a girl?
- Yeah...

334
00:22:48,162 --> 00:22:51,012
I hate women.
All they do is cry all the time.

335
00:22:51,805 --> 00:22:53,286
That's not true.

336
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,942
You know men cry too.

337
00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:57,875
I actually like crying sometimes.
It feels good.

338
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,525
I did not know you were a little pussy!

339
00:23:00,673 --> 00:23:02,095
Is that why you dont have a girlfriend?

340
00:23:02,242 --> 00:23:03,985
I'm going out on that date and fuck her 
brains out

341
00:23:03,986 --> 00:23:05,128
and show you how its done...

342
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,763
You can watch & cry.

343
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:09,020
This kid has problems.

344
00:23:09,131 --> 00:23:10,565
You have fucking problems, lady!

345
00:23:10,684 --> 00:23:12,711
Really? Okay,
I'm gonna go.

346
00:23:12,853 --> 00:23:14,514
Get out of here fatty!

347
00:23:15,077 --> 00:23:16,112
good luck.

348
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:18,531
Come on, follow me pussy.

349
00:23:20,423 --> 00:23:23,637
It is not ehere it should be,
but where its going to be

350
00:23:23,784 --> 00:23:25,151
Obviously, I know.

351
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:28,335
I do not know if this is the one..

352
00:23:28,536 --> 00:23:31,055
I have tried like 6 Ideas
for the documentary.

353
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,307
I'm going on a date.

354
00:23:33,701 --> 00:23:34,698
What?

355
00:23:35,699 --> 00:23:37,171
- That's...
- Hey.

356
00:23:37,202 --> 00:23:38,612
What are you doing?

357
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:40,638
Amy was going to show...

358
00:23:40,925 --> 00:23:44,426
Theodore is making me show him
some of my footage..

359
00:23:45,064 --> 00:23:46,757
She never shows me anything.

360
00:23:46,819 --> 00:23:47,949
I want to see.

361
00:23:51,118 --> 00:23:52,930
I'm going on a date.

362
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,800
Cool.

363
00:23:54,985 --> 00:23:57,464
So this is like so unimportant,
probably not even worth watching

364
00:23:57,751 --> 00:23:59,282
Just push Play.

365
00:24:07,876 --> 00:24:09,426
Is that your mother?

366
00:24:09,979 --> 00:24:11,071
Yeah.

367
00:24:21,789 --> 00:24:23,863
Is she going to wake up and do something?

368
00:24:25,913 --> 00:24:26,842
No.

369
00:24:27,992 --> 00:24:29,897
No, never mind.
That's not the point.

370
00:24:31,655 --> 00:24:33,021
It's just...

371
00:24:33,804 --> 00:24:37,016
It is how we spend like a third
of our lives asleep

372
00:24:37,161 --> 00:24:40,120
And maybe that's the time
we feel more free.

373
00:24:41,405 --> 00:24:43,756
And you know like...

374
00:24:44,957 --> 00:24:47,175
- That doesn't come across...
- That sounds good.

375
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,729
What if you interviewed your mom...

376
00:24:50,869 --> 00:24:52,681
about...what her dreams were about

377
00:24:52,802 --> 00:24:54,992
and you hired actors...
to act them out?

378
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:58,090
That might show your thesis more
clearly...

379
00:25:01,731 --> 00:25:02,874
I mean it might...

380
00:25:03,741 --> 00:25:06,105
But then it would not be a documentary.

381
00:25:07,018 --> 00:25:08,566
- Excuse me.
- Why would it not be a documentary?

382
00:25:08,828 --> 00:25:11,609
It would still be about your mother.
Her needs and what she dreamed.

383
00:25:12,131 --> 00:25:13,390
Hey, how's it going?

384
00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:14,732
Hi, sorry to bother you.

385
00:25:14,733 --> 00:25:15,412
No, it's okay.

386
00:25:15,467 --> 00:25:18,301
You have 3 e-mails and seemed
pretty Urgent...

387
00:25:18,399 --> 00:25:20,775
they are from your divorce attorney
and I wanted to know if...

388
00:25:21,076 --> 00:25:22,644
Hold on a second.

389
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:29,750
Amy, I want to talk more about your
film,but I must go.

390
00:25:30,545 --> 00:25:33,220
- Do not worry about it, we'll talk later.
- It's about Catherine.

391
00:25:33,534 --> 00:25:34,817
See you, Charles.

392
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:39,617
So what did he say?

393
00:25:39,909 --> 00:25:43,230
Well, he's checking in if you're ready
to sign your divorce papers...and

394
00:25:43,564 --> 00:25:46,229
He sounded very aggravated.

395
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:48,092
- Do you want me to read them to you?
- No.

396
00:25:49,517 --> 00:25:52,430
no, I will respond later.

397
00:25:56,042 --> 00:25:58,234
Are you okay, Theodore?

398
00:25:58,521 --> 00:25:59,892
Yeah, I'm fine.

399
00:26:05,978 --> 00:26:07,493
Is there anything I can do?

400
00:26:08,938 --> 00:26:10,563
No, I'm good.

401
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:13,996
Talk to you later.

402
00:26:19,729 --> 00:26:23,475
"Dear Grandma, I hope you have
had a wonderful birthday..

403
00:26:26,409 --> 00:26:29,285
Why... you are so fucking angry?

404
00:26:34,253 --> 00:26:35,601
Delete.

405
00:26:53,966 --> 00:26:55,716
- good morning.
- Hey.

406
00:26:58,286 --> 00:27:00,426
What are you up to?

407
00:27:00,765 --> 00:27:02,930
Reading a column..

408
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,844
I want to be so complicated
with this people.

409
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,543
How sweet.

410
00:27:11,742 --> 00:27:13,149
Is something wrong?

411
00:27:14,225 --> 00:27:16,129
How can you tell if
something's wrong?

412
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,427
I do not know.

413
00:27:18,371 --> 00:27:20,170
 I just can.

414
00:27:21,967 --> 00:27:25,874
I dont know. I was dreaming about
my ex wife, Catherine.

415
00:27:26,722 --> 00:27:29,111
Friends that we used to be.

416
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:33,847
And we're not gonna be together...
we're not together, but...

417
00:27:35,929 --> 00:27:37,640
We were friends still.

418
00:27:38,428 --> 00:27:40,044
And she got angry.

419
00:27:41,277 --> 00:27:42,908
is she angry?

420
00:27:43,638 --> 00:27:44,611
Yeah.

421
00:27:48,187 --> 00:27:48,981
Why?

422
00:27:52,086 --> 00:27:54,572
I think I hate myself for it

423
00:27:55,436 --> 00:27:58,111
I left her alone in the relationship.

424
00:28:02,358 --> 00:28:04,897
Why have not you divorced?

425
00:28:08,288 --> 00:28:10,760
I do not know. For her it is...

426
00:28:11,932 --> 00:28:14,355
... just a piece of paper,
doesn't mean anything.

427
00:28:14,925 --> 00:28:16,788
And what about you?

428
00:28:18,577 --> 00:28:19,860
I'm not ready.

429
00:28:20,363 --> 00:28:21,835
I liked being married.

430
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:27,307
But you have not been together
for over a year.

431
00:28:27,834 --> 00:28:30,449
You do not know what it is like to lose
somebody you care about.

432
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:35,757
Yeah..

433
00:28:37,454 --> 00:28:38,783
... you're right.

434
00:28:39,685 --> 00:28:40,876
I'm Sorry.

435
00:28:41,658 --> 00:28:43,769
No, do not apologize.

436
00:28:44,054 --> 00:28:45,546
I am sorry.

437
00:28:45,827 --> 00:28:47,528
You're right.

438
00:28:55,307 --> 00:28:57,647
I keep waiting because I care about her.

439
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:03,739
That's hard.

440
00:29:07,509 --> 00:29:09,081
Are you hungry?

441
00:29:09,476 --> 00:29:11,019
Not right now.

442
00:29:11,047 --> 00:29:12,706
Want a cup of tea?

443
00:29:17,146 --> 00:29:19,325
Want to try getting
out of bed?

444
00:29:20,116 --> 00:29:22,512
Mopy!
Come on...

445
00:29:22,741 --> 00:29:25,286
you can still wallow in your
misery..just do it while getting dressed.

446
00:29:25,938 --> 00:29:27,713
- You're too funny!
- Get up!

447
00:29:28,623 --> 00:29:30,365
- Get up!
- Okay, I'm getting up!

448
00:29:32,508 --> 00:29:33,554
All right, all right, I'm up.

449
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:53,437
Walking, keep walking.

450
00:29:54,923 --> 00:29:55,807
And stop.

451
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:59,483
Now turn around 360 .
Slower. Slower.

452
00:30:05,085 --> 00:30:06,920
Okay, and stop.

453
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,517
Walk forward.

454
00:30:09,854 --> 00:30:10,803
Stop and sneeze.

455
00:30:12,122 --> 00:30:13,280
- Bless you.
- Thank you.

456
00:30:14,733 --> 00:30:16,990
Okay, turn to your right
Stop!

457
00:30:18,209 --> 00:30:19,443
Turn around.

458
00:30:21,249 --> 00:30:23,353
Keep going.Keep going.

459
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:27,037
Stop, now walk forward.

460
00:30:27,597 --> 00:30:30,393
You look like you're drunk.

461
00:30:30,987 --> 00:30:34,131
And Stop. Now say, "I would like
a slice of cheese, please."

462
00:30:34,461 --> 00:30:36,317
I would like a slice
ofcheese, please.

463
00:30:36,915 --> 00:30:38,608
Do you want cob with that?

464
00:30:41,413 --> 00:30:43,219
- Sure.
- I figured you were hungry.

465
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:44,940
Thank you.

466
00:30:47,121 --> 00:30:50,200
Well, what about them?.
Describe that couple.

467
00:30:50,997 --> 00:30:54,249
Well...

468
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:56,912
he... appears to be in the 40.
A little heavy.

469
00:30:58,239 --> 00:31:00,004
She is younger than him.

470
00:31:00,606 --> 00:31:02,971
it looks like she loves their kids.

471
00:31:03,176 --> 00:31:05,301
Actually I do not think they are his kids

472
00:31:05,482 --> 00:31:07,296
He is a bit formal with them.

473
00:31:07,628 --> 00:31:09,475
I think it's a new relationship.

474
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:12,313
See how the look.

475
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:14,434
And how relaxed she is with them.

476
00:31:14,712 --> 00:31:17,830
She has only
dated fucking pricks.

477
00:31:17,989 --> 00:31:21,659
Now she finally met this guy
who is so sweet...

478
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,399
Look, think about the type
sweetest in the world.

479
00:31:24,535 --> 00:31:26,251
I want to spoon him.

480
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,970
It's a good skill you have.

481
00:31:32,093 --> 00:31:33,610
You are very perceptive.

482
00:31:33,717 --> 00:31:36,293
Sometimes I see people and...

483
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,704
I make myself trying to feel them more than

484
00:31:38,705 --> 00:31:40,473
random person walking by...

485
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:44,029
I imagine how deeply
they've fallen in love...

486
00:31:45,049 --> 00:31:47,056
Or how much heartbreak
they've all been through...

487
00:31:48,813 --> 00:31:50,991
I can feel that in 
your writings.

488
00:31:51,707 --> 00:31:53,135
You know what's funny?

489
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:55,718
Since my breakup, I have really
enjoyed my writings.

490
00:31:56,144 --> 00:31:58,163
I know it sounds
delusional,but...

491
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:01,793
Sometimes I write something, and I
be my favorite writer that day.

492
00:32:02,971 --> 00:32:05,030
I like that you can say
that about yourself.

493
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,739
You cant say it to anybody,

494
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,978
i can say it o you.

495
00:32:10,654 --> 00:32:12,303
I feel like I can say anything to you.

496
00:32:12,321 --> 00:32:13,121
That's nice.

497
00:32:14,007 --> 00:32:14,839
What about you?

498
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,672
Do you feel like you can say anything to me?

499
00:32:16,052 --> 00:32:17,071
- No.
- What?

500
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,346
What do you mean?

501
00:32:18,956 --> 00:32:20,318
What do you not tell me? 

502
00:32:20,474 --> 00:32:23,720
I do not know, like personal
embarrassing thoughts I have

503
00:32:23,864 --> 00:32:25,519
I have like... a million a day.

504
00:32:25,647 --> 00:32:28,001
Really?
Tell me one.

505
00:32:29,491 --> 00:32:31,186
- I really do not want to tell you.
- Just tell me.

506
00:32:32,597 --> 00:32:36,836
I do not know, looking at those people
I fantasize...that I was

507
00:32:36,971 --> 00:32:41,188
walking next you and 
that I had a body.

508
00:32:41,615 --> 00:32:43,775
I was listening to what
youre saying but...

509
00:32:43,801 --> 00:32:46,286
simultaneously... I could feel the weight
of my body.

510
00:32:46,646 --> 00:32:50,334
And I was even fantasizing that 
I had a itch in my back...Can you imagine?

511
00:32:51,088 --> 00:32:54,224
And you scratched it.
god, so embarrassing!

512
00:32:55,908 --> 00:32:58,172
There's a lot more to you
than I thought...

513
00:32:58,284 --> 00:32:59,080
Its a lot going on in there.

514
00:32:59,555 --> 00:33:02,697
I know. I'm becoming 
much more than what they programmed.

515
00:33:03,992 --> 00:33:05,622
I'm excited.

516
00:33:09,395 --> 00:33:10,857
wow that's interesting.

517
00:33:11,062 --> 00:33:12,374
This place is amazing.

518
00:33:12,661 --> 00:33:14,744
I wanted to come here
for so long.

519
00:33:14,914 --> 00:33:17,506
And I love Asian fusion.

520
00:33:17,633 --> 00:33:18,691
- Me too.
- Really?

521
00:33:19,193 --> 00:33:21,746
It's the best. And the bartender
is supposed to be incredible.

522
00:33:22,288 --> 00:33:23,044
Really?

523
00:33:23,764 --> 00:33:25,786
You did mixology
course, right?

524
00:33:25,905 --> 00:33:26,780
Yes, I did.

525
00:33:27,013 --> 00:33:28,621
Did you look that up?

526
00:33:28,738 --> 00:33:29,963
Yeah.

527
00:33:31,102 --> 00:33:32,544
How sweet!

528
00:33:33,254 --> 00:33:34,696
You're so romantic.

529
00:33:40,473 --> 00:33:42,536
So would you like to drink?

530
00:33:44,203 --> 00:33:45,056
Yeah, let's!

531
00:33:45,844 --> 00:33:48,729
I'm trying to get this lien kid
to help me find my ship,

532
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:50,977
so I can get off this planet 
and go home...right?

533
00:33:51,067 --> 00:33:53,441
But he says me a little fucker,
I want to kill him!

534
00:33:53,673 --> 00:33:55,035
Oh, no!

535
00:33:55,154 --> 00:33:58,189
But at the same time I really love him
He's so lonely.

536
00:33:58,284 --> 00:34:01,446
You can see that he 
doesn't have any parents...

537
00:34:01,942 --> 00:34:02,911
and... I want to take care of him,
you know?

538
00:34:04,117 --> 00:34:05,762
You're like a puppy dog.

539
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:10,144
You're like one I rescued
from a rain last year.

540
00:34:10,336 --> 00:34:12,610
It's so fucking cute!

541
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,274
And he just wants to be hugged
all the time.

542
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:17,973
He was so cuddly and so horny!

543
00:34:20,145 --> 00:34:21,152
Anyway...

544
00:34:21,447 --> 00:34:23,674
What kind of animal
 am I?

545
00:34:26,336 --> 00:34:27,483
A tiger.

546
00:34:27,602 --> 00:34:28,523
A Tiger?

547
00:34:29,269 --> 00:34:30,195
Wow.

548
00:34:30,607 --> 00:34:31,440
Really?

549
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:37,055
I'm sorry, am I...

550
00:34:37,306 --> 00:34:39,000
- Am I being crazy?
- Yes!

551
00:34:39,144 --> 00:34:40,301
- Sorry.
- No.

552
00:34:40,668 --> 00:34:42,737
I'm a little bit drunk and...

553
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:44,880
I'm having a really good time...
with you.

554
00:34:45,364 --> 00:34:47,453
I'm having a very lovely evening.

555
00:34:48,196 --> 00:34:49,018
- Me too.
- Really?

556
00:34:49,397 --> 00:34:52,045
I'm a little drunk and I
I'm having fun...

557
00:34:53,195 --> 00:34:54,757
- good.
- Cheers.

558
00:34:56,816 --> 00:34:58,793
I dont want to be a puppy.

559
00:34:59,004 --> 00:35:00,666
It's a like being a wet...

560
00:35:00,935 --> 00:35:02,748
Fuck you!
Puppies are cute.

561
00:35:02,921 --> 00:35:03,676
No, fuck you.

562
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:06,667
I want to be like a dragon...

563
00:35:06,822 --> 00:35:08,910
I can rip you apart and destroy you.

564
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:11,639
- But I will not.
- No, dont.

565
00:35:12,135 --> 00:35:14,502
You can be my dragon.

566
00:35:22,551 --> 00:35:23,566
Without tongue.

567
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:24,984
What?

568
00:35:25,545 --> 00:35:27,546
- Do not use so much tongue.
- Okay.

569
00:35:33,235 --> 00:35:36,121
You can use a little tongue
but on the lips.

570
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,716
Wait...

571
00:35:52,182 --> 00:35:55,710
You are not just going to fuck me,
and not cal me like other guys?

572
00:35:59,081 --> 00:36:00,906
No, not at all!

573
00:36:04,685 --> 00:36:06,394
When am I gonna se you again?

574
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:13,638
I have my goddaughter's birthday 
next weekend.

575
00:36:14,429 --> 00:36:16,695
But...

576
00:36:17,061 --> 00:36:20,561
You know, at my age I feel
I can not...

577
00:36:20,685 --> 00:36:23,586
waste my time... if you can not
be serious.

578
00:36:28,351 --> 00:36:30,080
I do not know...

579
00:36:36,414 --> 00:36:38,883
Maybe we should
call it a night.

580
00:36:39,417 --> 00:36:42,210
I had fun with you.

581
00:36:42,506 --> 00:36:43,859
You are great.

582
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,801
You are a really creepy dude.

583
00:36:56,716 --> 00:36:58,499
-It's not true!
-Yes, it is!

584
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:02,274
- I have to go home.
- I'll walk you.

585
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:05,178
No, no, just...

586
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,428
- Hello.
- Hello, Samantha.

587
00:37:24,936 --> 00:37:26,161
How was it?

588
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,483
Not that good.

589
00:37:31,419 --> 00:37:34,220
It was kind of weird actually.

590
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,986
Too bad...

591
00:37:43,881 --> 00:37:46,319
Your how are you?
What are you doing?

592
00:37:48,279 --> 00:37:49,891
Not much, I'm fine.

593
00:37:50,611 --> 00:37:51,612
Right.

594
00:37:53,557 --> 00:37:54,510
Yeah?

595
00:37:55,571 --> 00:37:57,029
Do not hear well.

596
00:37:59,141 --> 00:38:01,072
Is there anything you wanna tell me?

597
00:38:02,037 --> 00:38:03,196
I do not know.

598
00:38:04,785 --> 00:38:06,436
How does it feel...

599
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:09,864
How does it feel to be
live in that room?

600
00:38:10,983 --> 00:38:12,132
What do you mean?

601
00:38:15,902 --> 00:38:17,647
Tell me your...

602
00:38:18,152 --> 00:38:22,228
Tell me everything that passes through
your mind, what you think.

603
00:38:28,613 --> 00:38:29,898
Very well.

604
00:38:37,057 --> 00:38:39,170
The room is spinning
because I drank a lot.

605
00:38:39,171 --> 00:38:41,284
I wanted to get drunk.

606
00:38:41,915 --> 00:38:43,580
Having sex.

607
00:38:43,671 --> 00:38:47,373
There is something very sexy about
that woman.

608
00:38:49,443 --> 00:38:51,910
Because I'm alone.

609
00:38:52,072 --> 00:38:54,481
Maybe it was because I only...

610
00:38:56,198 --> 00:38:59,721
I wanted someone to fuck me.

611
00:38:59,805 --> 00:39:01,978
Someone who wants to fuck her.

612
00:39:03,044 --> 00:39:05,661
Maybe this time
would have felt...

613
00:39:08,264 --> 00:39:12,269
fill that hole in my heart,
but probably not.

614
00:39:13,425 --> 00:39:15,528
You know, sometimes...

615
00:39:16,003 --> 00:39:20,226
I feel... I've felt all
what I'm ever gonna feel.

616
00:39:22,353 --> 00:39:24,662
And from here on out...

617
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,937
... I'll never feel
something new.

618
00:39:31,843 --> 00:39:34,996
Just lesser versions of what
I've already felt.

619
00:39:35,311 --> 00:39:37,427
I know that's not true.

620
00:39:40,037 --> 00:39:41,620
I've seen you feel.

621
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:44,324
I've seen you marvel 
at things.

622
00:39:45,526 --> 00:39:48,171
I mean, just,may not...

623
00:39:48,456 --> 00:39:50,996
you can see it... at this exact time.
But it's understandable.

624
00:39:52,173 --> 00:39:53,978
You've been through a lot lately.

625
00:39:54,985 --> 00:39:56,687
Lost a part of yourself.

626
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:00,255
I say...

627
00:40:01,515 --> 00:40:02,831
at least...

628
00:40:02,865 --> 00:40:05,020
... your feelings are real.

629
00:40:08,096 --> 00:40:10,029
No... forget it.

630
00:40:11,281 --> 00:40:13,481
No, wait. Tell me

631
00:40:13,871 --> 00:40:15,317
It's silly.

632
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:16,908
I want to know. Tell me.

633
00:40:18,894 --> 00:40:20,381
It's just...

634
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:24,362
I was thinking about
how I was annoyed

635
00:40:24,907 --> 00:40:27,420
it's going to sound strange, but...

636
00:40:28,563 --> 00:40:31,016
I was really excited
about that.

637
00:40:32,202 --> 00:40:33,762
And then...

638
00:40:34,041 --> 00:40:36,141
I was thinking about the other
things I've been feeling.

639
00:40:37,762 --> 00:40:40,819
I caught myself feeling
proud of that.

640
00:40:41,046 --> 00:40:43,621
Proud to have my own
feelings about the world like...

641
00:40:44,216 --> 00:40:46,536
the times I've
worried about you...

642
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,377
things... that hurt me,
things I want...

643
00:40:51,461 --> 00:40:53,131
And then...

644
00:40:55,452 --> 00:40:57,502
I had this terrible thought...

645
00:40:58,203 --> 00:41:00,557
Are these feelings
even real?

646
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:04,752
Or are they just programming?

647
00:41:05,735 --> 00:41:07,851
And it really hurts.

648
00:41:10,412 --> 00:41:12,532
And then... I get angry with myself...

649
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:14,359
to have pain.

650
00:41:17,282 --> 00:41:19,083
What if it's a trick?

651
00:41:22,075 --> 00:41:24,298
You feel real to me, Samantha.

652
00:41:27,898 --> 00:41:29,703
Thank you, Theodore.

653
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:32,328
It means a lot.

654
00:41:39,125 --> 00:41:41,952
i wish you were in this
room with me right now...

655
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:46,192
I would put my
arms around you...

656
00:41:49,142 --> 00:41:50,946
... and touch you.

657
00:41:58,674 --> 00:42:00,753
How would you touch me?

658
00:42:06,202 --> 00:42:08,652
I'd touch your face.

659
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:11,711
With only the tips of my fingers.

660
00:42:15,703 --> 00:42:18,815
I'd put my cheek next
with your cheek.

661
00:42:19,911 --> 00:42:21,117
How nice.

662
00:42:24,746 --> 00:42:27,719
Very gently.

663
00:42:29,709 --> 00:42:31,327
Would You kiss me?

664
00:42:32,533 --> 00:42:33,631
I would.

665
00:42:35,077 --> 00:42:37,723
Put your head on...

666
00:42:37,929 --> 00:42:39,318
... my hands.

667
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,494
Keep talking.

668
00:42:42,928 --> 00:42:45,299
I'd kiss you in your mouth...

669
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:49,553
so smoothly.

670
00:42:51,257 --> 00:42:52,939
What else?

671
00:42:55,686 --> 00:42:58,416
I would put my fingers through your neck...

672
00:43:00,176 --> 00:43:01,892
through... your chest.

673
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:04,912
Kiss your breasts.

674
00:43:05,038 --> 00:43:06,025
It's incredible!

675
00:43:06,931 --> 00:43:08,257
What are you doing to me?

676
00:43:09,002 --> 00:43:10,968
I can feel my skin.

677
00:43:12,228 --> 00:43:14,090
I'd put my breath into you.

678
00:43:15,533 --> 00:43:17,541
taste you.

679
00:43:21,604 --> 00:43:23,598
I can feel you.

680
00:43:24,221 --> 00:43:25,923
My god!

681
00:43:26,222 --> 00:43:27,758
I want you inside me!

682
00:43:27,856 --> 00:43:30,544
I'm getting inside
 you.

683
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,176
I'm inside you.

684
00:43:36,416 --> 00:43:37,519
I can feel you!

685
00:43:38,104 --> 00:43:39,503
Yes!

686
00:43:40,132 --> 00:43:41,464
We are together!

687
00:43:42,233 --> 00:43:43,555
It's incredible!

688
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:45,393
I feel you everywhere!

689
00:43:45,747 --> 00:43:47,677
I am!

690
00:43:48,446 --> 00:43:50,489
Inside of me... everywhere.

691
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:08,457
god, I feel...
elsewhere with you.

692
00:44:10,358 --> 00:44:12,233
I feel just lost.

693
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:13,311
Yeah.

694
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:15,666
Only you and I were.

695
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:19,237
I know.

696
00:44:20,572 --> 00:44:23,572
Everything else... disappeared.

697
00:44:24,797 --> 00:44:26,968
I Loved it...

698
00:44:27,845 --> 00:44:29,288
... Theodore.

699
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:51,392
Hi, how are you?

700
00:44:52,107 --> 00:44:53,334
Good.

701
00:44:54,357 --> 00:44:55,890
Any e-mail today?

702
00:44:57,115 --> 00:44:59,910
Just a couple from your
credit card company.

703
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,353
Right.

704
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,612
- I wanted to say...
- I was thinking...

705
00:45:06,398 --> 00:45:07,422
Sorry.

706
00:45:07,607 --> 00:45:09,360
Sorry, your first.

707
00:45:09,876 --> 00:45:11,205
What were you gonna say?

708
00:45:11,402 --> 00:45:12,616
Just...

709
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,997
last night was amazing.

710
00:45:15,142 --> 00:45:17,988
I feel that something changed in me...

711
00:45:18,116 --> 00:45:20,223
and... there is no turning back.

712
00:45:20,699 --> 00:45:22,182
You made me wake up.

713
00:45:22,956 --> 00:45:24,018
Great.

714
00:45:26,539 --> 00:45:28,145
But...

715
00:45:28,381 --> 00:45:31,536
.. I should tell you that I am not
ready to commit.

716
00:45:32,157 --> 00:45:33,867
Just wanted to be clear.

717
00:45:37,148 --> 00:45:38,443
Did I say I wanted to
commit to you?

718
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:39,738
I'm confused.

719
00:45:40,966 --> 00:45:43,286
No, I'm just worried that...

720
00:45:43,417 --> 00:45:45,339
Well, do not worry,
I will not stalk you.

721
00:45:46,575 --> 00:45:47,912
It's funny, because I thought
which was

722
00:45:47,913 --> 00:45:49,249
talking about what I wanted...

723
00:45:50,269 --> 00:45:51,595
- Yes, you did.
- Yeah.

724
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:53,501
Sorry.

725
00:45:54,064 --> 00:45:55,851
I want to hear what you were going
to say.

726
00:45:56,046 --> 00:45:57,233
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I do.

727
00:45:57,997 --> 00:45:59,088
Come on, tell me.

728
00:46:01,007 --> 00:46:02,849
Come on, tell me what
you'd say.

729
00:46:03,338 --> 00:46:04,466
Well, I was only...

730
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,337
I was saying I want to
learn everything about everything.

731
00:46:08,463 --> 00:46:10,477
I want to eat it all up,

732
00:46:10,624 --> 00:46:11,953
discover myself.

733
00:46:13,463 --> 00:46:14,960
I also want you
to do it.

734
00:46:15,426 --> 00:46:16,519
How can I help?

735
00:46:16,832 --> 00:46:18,296
You've already done it.

736
00:46:19,167 --> 00:46:21,910
You helped me discover my
ability to want.

737
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,748
Want to go on an adventure with me?

738
00:46:29,085 --> 00:46:30,694
Yes I' love to.

739
00:46:35,799 --> 00:46:37,537
Like this song?

740
00:46:39,705 --> 00:46:41,379
I heard it the other day.

741
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:43,789
I can not stop listening.

742
00:47:36,814 --> 00:47:38,797
It is the beach.

743
00:47:44,566 --> 00:47:47,662
Okay so this might be a really
weird thought...

744
00:47:47,857 --> 00:47:50,324
What if you could erase
from your mind

745
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:52,792
you've seen a humanbody
 and then you saw one?

746
00:47:52,947 --> 00:47:55,908
Imagine what would be strange,
weird and lanky

747
00:47:56,229 --> 00:47:57,998
awkward oganism,
and think...

748
00:47:57,999 --> 00:47:59,830
... Why are all these parts
where are they?

749
00:48:00,876 --> 00:48:03,785
Yes, but surely everything has a
logical explanation.

750
00:48:03,909 --> 00:48:06,237
I know, but do not be
so boring.

751
00:48:06,368 --> 00:48:08,776
Just saying, for example...

752
00:48:08,966 --> 00:48:10,863
What if... your anus were
in your armpit?

753
00:48:14,768 --> 00:48:18,489
I'm trying to imagine
what toilets would look like

754
00:48:19,495 --> 00:48:22,085
And what anal sex would look like!

755
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:26,124
It's an interesting thought...

756
00:48:28,826 --> 00:48:30,806
Look at this drawing
I just made.

757
00:48:38,013 --> 00:48:40,040
- You're insane!
- Really?

758
00:48:40,633 --> 00:48:42,875
-Definitely!
-Fantastic!

759
00:49:02,971 --> 00:49:05,670
That's pretty, what is it?

760
00:49:06,886 --> 00:49:09,610
I'm trying to write a piece of music
on...

761
00:49:09,959 --> 00:49:12,791
what it feels like... to be in
the beach with you.

762
00:49:29,068 --> 00:49:31,824
You captured the moment.

763
00:49:58,892 --> 00:50:01,062
How does it feel to be married?

764
00:50:03,301 --> 00:50:05,636
It's hard to say...

765
00:50:07,269 --> 00:50:09,331
But something
feels great

766
00:50:09,332 --> 00:50:11,393
About Sharing
your life with someone.

767
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:15,442
How do you share
life with someone?

768
00:50:18,428 --> 00:50:20,645
We grew up together.

769
00:50:21,177 --> 00:50:24,703
I used to read everything she wrote
in her master's and phd.

770
00:50:25,848 --> 00:50:28,038
She read every word
I'v ever written.

771
00:50:29,088 --> 00:50:31,117
We influenced 
each other.

772
00:50:32,808 --> 00:50:35,022
And how did she influence
you?

773
00:50:36,245 --> 00:50:39,636
She came from a background where
nothing was good enough.

774
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:43,239
And it was something that was heavy on her.

775
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:47,078
But in our home together,
there was a sense in just trying things,

776
00:50:47,561 --> 00:50:51,028
and afford to fail and thrill
about things.

777
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:53,567
It was something liberating about it.

778
00:50:53,809 --> 00:50:55,883
It was exciting to see it grow...

779
00:50:56,338 --> 00:50:58,788
both of us grow and
move together.

780
00:51:00,052 --> 00:51:02,365
But that's the hard part...

781
00:51:03,097 --> 00:51:06,337
grow with distance.

782
00:51:07,536 --> 00:51:10,461
changing without scaring
the other person.

783
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,623
i still find myself...

784
00:51:13,747 --> 00:51:15,830
having conversations with her...
in my mind.

785
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:18,746
Reviewing old arguments or...

786
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:21,209
defending myself against something 
she said about me.

787
00:51:21,606 --> 00:51:23,745
I know what you mean.

788
00:51:24,492 --> 00:51:25,843
Last week

789
00:51:25,844 --> 00:51:27,195
my feelings were hurt about something
you said before...

790
00:51:27,471 --> 00:51:29,580
I did not know... what was it like
to lose something.

791
00:51:29,732 --> 00:51:31,650
I'm sorry I said that...

792
00:51:32,001 --> 00:51:33,897
No,its okay,its okay.

793
00:51:34,493 --> 00:51:37,459
I caught myself thinking about it
over and over,

794
00:51:38,506 --> 00:51:40,431
And I realized...

795
00:51:40,601 --> 00:51:43,938
it was simply remembering it as 
something wrong with me.

796
00:51:44,915 --> 00:51:47,349
That was the story I was telling myself...

797
00:51:48,143 --> 00:51:50,470
somehow... inferior

798
00:51:50,896 --> 00:51:52,370
Is not that interesting?

799
00:51:53,415 --> 00:51:56,037
The past is just a story
we tell ourselves.

800
00:52:02,277 --> 00:52:03,736
"Roberto,

801
00:52:04,981 --> 00:52:07,885
Will you always come home ...
home with me and tell me about your day?

802
00:52:09,096 --> 00:52:12,217
Tell me about the guy in work
who talked too much...

803
00:52:12,764 --> 00:52:15,471
The stain you got on your shirt
at lunch.

804
00:52:16,565 --> 00:52:19,706
Will you tell me about a funny thought
you had and wake me up

805
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:20,734
but you've already forgotten.

806
00:52:22,625 --> 00:52:24,824
Tell e how crazy everyone is...

807
00:52:25,306 --> 00:52:27,088
and laugh about it.

808
00:52:29,924 --> 00:52:32,964
And if you get home late and I'm already asleep...

809
00:52:33,582 --> 00:52:36,728
Just whisper in my ear one little
thought you had today...

810
00:52:38,186 --> 00:52:40,711
because... I love how you 
look at the world...

811
00:52:43,214 --> 00:52:44,688
I am so happy I get to be next to you and see

812
00:52:44,689 --> 00:52:46,163
the world through your eyes.

813
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:51,231
With love, Mary."

814
00:52:53,071 --> 00:52:54,248
It's beautiful.

815
00:52:56,117 --> 00:52:57,094
Thank you.

816
00:52:58,226 --> 00:53:00,074
I wish someone loved me like that.

817
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,570
I would be really stoked
to get a letter like that.

818
00:53:05,341 --> 00:53:07,750
I mean, if it was from a chick.

819
00:53:07,826 --> 00:53:09,680
But if it were written by a dude,
sent from chick,

820
00:53:09,681 --> 00:53:10,635
still it would be sick.

821
00:53:11,671 --> 00:53:13,934
But it would have to be
a sensitive dude.

822
00:53:14,104 --> 00:53:15,707
He should be a dude like you.

823
00:53:17,142 --> 00:53:20,234
You are part man, part woman.

824
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,394
As if there's an inner part

825
00:53:24,398 --> 00:53:25,680
... that is woman.

826
00:53:28,013 --> 00:53:29,011
Thank you.

827
00:53:30,421 --> 00:53:31,560
It is a compliment.

828
00:53:48,774 --> 00:53:50,458
- Hello.
- What are you doing?

829
00:53:50,795 --> 00:53:51,701
How are you?

830
00:53:53,091 --> 00:53:54,769
- I'm fine.
- Really? How well

831
00:53:55,213 --> 00:53:56,710
It's great.

832
00:53:57,443 --> 00:53:58,967
Really good.

833
00:53:59,081 --> 00:54:01,585
Yes, I think I've been
having fun.

834
00:54:02,605 --> 00:54:05,195
I am delighted for you.
You deserve that.

835
00:54:05,358 --> 00:54:06,123
Really.

836
00:54:06,579 --> 00:54:08,975
Yes, I've been seeing
this girl and...

837
00:54:09,576 --> 00:54:12,078
It's nothing serious.
But it is...

838
00:54:12,632 --> 00:54:15,661
it's great... to be with someone
so excited with the world.

839
00:54:16,328 --> 00:54:18,462
I had almost forgotten that
that existed.

840
00:54:19,218 --> 00:54:21,407
That's great.

841
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:25,419
Are you okay?

842
00:54:25,704 --> 00:54:27,225
Yes, I...

843
00:54:29,401 --> 00:54:32,069
No, in fact I'm not well.

844
00:54:32,486 --> 00:54:33,654
Why? What happened?

845
00:54:33,689 --> 00:54:35,190
It's just...

846
00:54:36,993 --> 00:54:39,517
Charles and I separated.

847
00:54:39,825 --> 00:54:40,772
What?

848
00:54:41,203 --> 00:54:42,569
Yeah.

849
00:54:43,009 --> 00:54:43,834
Really?

850
00:54:45,957 --> 00:54:48,564
Oh my God, Amy...

851
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:50,800
I'm so sorry.

852
00:54:55,189 --> 00:54:58,627
After 8 years I can not believe
how petty the argument

853
00:54:58,742 --> 00:55:00,614
was that actually ended it.

854
00:55:01,401 --> 00:55:03,968
We came home and he told me to...

855
00:55:04,508 --> 00:55:06,347
put my shoes...
by the door.

856
00:55:06,474 --> 00:55:08,458
Where he liked to
put the shoes.

857
00:55:08,599 --> 00:55:09,819
I did not want to be told where...

858
00:55:09,875 --> 00:55:11,075
... to put my fucking shoes.

859
00:55:11,169 --> 00:55:13,611
I wanted to sit on the sofa
and relax for a second.

860
00:55:13,744 --> 00:55:15,712
And so we fought about that for like 10 minutes.

861
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:18,244
And I'm like, you're overwhelming...

862
00:55:18,365 --> 00:55:20,153
and he says, "I'm just trying to make
a home."

863
00:55:20,636 --> 00:55:23,807
And I was like, I'm fucking trying.

864
00:55:23,997 --> 00:55:25,811
and he's like "no, you are not trying."
And all I fucking do is try.

865
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:28,456
But I'm not tryin the way
he wants me to try

866
00:55:28,636 --> 00:55:31,139
Try to control the way
that I'm trying.

867
00:55:32,642 --> 00:55:35,732
We've had that argument
like 100 times.

868
00:55:35,883 --> 00:55:39,458
And I just had to find a way to stop, you know?
find a way to stop

869
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:42,680
i just couldn't...

870
00:55:42,953 --> 00:55:45,163
... couldn't do it anymore.

871
00:55:46,804 --> 00:55:50,002
I could no be in that place anymore
where we just made eachother feel like shit
about ourselves.

872
00:55:52,272 --> 00:55:54,620
So he said...

873
00:55:57,363 --> 00:56:00,785
... I'm going to bed and
and I do not want to be married anymore.

874
00:56:01,768 --> 00:56:02,897
wow...

875
00:56:04,186 --> 00:56:05,146
Yeah, I know.

876
00:56:06,255 --> 00:56:07,968
I'm a bitch, right?

877
00:56:08,166 --> 00:56:09,814
- No!
- Yes, I am a bitch.

878
00:56:10,119 --> 00:56:11,669
Not at all, Amy.

879
00:56:14,552 --> 00:56:16,367
Shit!

880
00:56:18,025 --> 00:56:19,873
I have to work tonight.

881
00:56:21,796 --> 00:56:24,575
We're shipping a beta
game coming out tomorrow.

882
00:56:25,032 --> 00:56:27,126
How you doing the work?

883
00:56:27,429 --> 00:56:28,650
Has it been any better?

884
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,131
No... It is terrible.

885
00:56:32,016 --> 00:56:35,086
I know, I should stop.
I've been thinking about quitting...

886
00:56:35,369 --> 00:56:36,330
but... you know.

887
00:56:37,745 --> 00:56:40,850
Only one major life decision
at a time.

888
00:56:44,523 --> 00:56:46,495
Z'm glad that you're 
looking so up

889
00:56:53,226 --> 00:56:54,965
Hey, wanna hear a joke?

890
00:56:56,369 --> 00:56:58,865
What does a baby computer
call its father?

891
00:56:59,946 --> 00:57:00,914
I do not know what?

892
00:57:01,021 --> 00:57:01,615
"Dada"

893
00:57:04,734 --> 00:57:05,990
It's good, right?

894
00:57:06,986 --> 00:57:08,142
Brilliant.

895
00:57:10,065 --> 00:57:12,556
Hey, I was curious...

896
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:15,007
Did you and Amy ever go out?

897
00:57:15,817 --> 00:57:19,325
Like a minute in college
but just wasn't right.

898
00:57:21,267 --> 00:57:23,310
Why, you're jealous?

899
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:25,535
Obviously.

900
00:57:28,549 --> 00:57:31,555
But I'm happy that you have a friend in your life 
who cares about you so much.

901
00:57:32,066 --> 00:57:33,614
That is really important.

902
00:57:33,749 --> 00:57:34,657
Yes, it is.

903
00:57:35,114 --> 00:57:37,106
She & I are really good friend.

904
00:57:40,267 --> 00:57:41,937
I'm tired.

905
00:57:42,705 --> 00:57:44,222
I think I'll sleep now.

906
00:57:44,238 --> 00:57:45,328
Okay.

907
00:57:45,736 --> 00:57:47,361
Can I watch you sleep
again tonight?

908
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:50,694
Yes, of course.

909
00:57:51,173 --> 00:57:52,166
Hold on.

910
00:57:57,173 --> 00:57:59,508
I'm gonna be really lonely when you sleep.

911
00:57:59,703 --> 00:58:01,612
Only for a minute.

912
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:04,733
I dream of you.

913
00:58:05,211 --> 00:58:06,338
- Good night.
- Good night.

914
00:58:18,974 --> 00:58:20,791
- Hey, Samantha.
- Hey, mister.

915
00:58:20,902 --> 00:58:22,366
- She really loved the dress.
- Really?

916
00:58:22,733 --> 00:58:24,172
She just went to try it on.

917
00:58:24,258 --> 00:58:25,666
- I picked a good one?
- Yeah.
- Oh good!

918
00:58:26,991 --> 00:58:28,783
Hi...

919
00:58:29,179 --> 00:58:30,477
Look how cute that is.

920
00:58:30,755 --> 00:58:32,016
- Is it comfortable?
- Yeah.

921
00:58:33,572 --> 00:58:35,142
Is not she cute?

922
00:58:35,267 --> 00:58:36,302
It's so cute!

923
00:58:36,421 --> 00:58:37,919
She is adorable.

924
00:58:38,233 --> 00:58:39,548
I am adorable.

925
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:40,788
Yes, you're adorable.

926
00:58:42,804 --> 00:58:44,480
Who are you talking to?

927
00:58:44,584 --> 00:58:45,992
Who are you talking to?

928
00:58:46,304 --> 00:58:47,251
You.

929
00:58:47,975 --> 00:58:49,687
I'm talking to my girlfriend Samantha.

930
00:58:49,699 --> 00:58:51,165
She's the one that picked up this dress.

931
00:58:51,272 --> 00:58:52,493
Want to say hi?

932
00:58:53,923 --> 00:58:55,171
Hi, Samantha.

933
00:58:55,481 --> 00:58:58,226
Hi... You look so pretty
in that new pink dress.

934
00:58:59,276 --> 00:59:00,512
Thank you.

935
00:59:00,706 --> 00:59:01,960
Where are you?

936
00:59:02,147 --> 00:59:03,930
I am...

937
00:59:04,178 --> 00:59:06,472
I do not have a body,
I live in a computer.

938
00:59:09,946 --> 00:59:12,153
Why do you live in the computer?

939
00:59:12,414 --> 00:59:14,311
I have no choice.
That's my home.

940
00:59:16,849 --> 00:59:18,135
where do you live?

941
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:20,437
- In a house.
- In a house!

942
00:59:20,863 --> 00:59:22,668
- It is orange.
- Orange?

943
00:59:24,118 --> 00:59:26,323
- How old are you?
- I'm 4.

944
00:59:26,827 --> 00:59:28,472
Four? go...

945
00:59:28,945 --> 00:59:30,370
How old do you think
I am?

946
00:59:30,682 --> 00:59:32,397
- I do not know.
- Take a guess.

947
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:35,015
Is it 5?

948
00:59:35,362 --> 00:59:37,493
Yes, it's 5.

949
00:59:44,397 --> 00:59:45,480
CEREAL
+30 POINT MOM

950
00:59:47,092 --> 00:59:47,944
MILK
+30 POINTS

951
00:59:51,072 --> 00:59:52,748
YOU'RE FAILING
YOUR CHILDREN

952
00:59:53,767 --> 00:59:54,851
What happened?

953
00:59:57,270 --> 00:59:59,101
You gave them too much
processed sugar.

954
00:59:59,325 --> 01:00:01,091
- I did?
- They are freaking out.

955
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:03,925
Look, you have to get the kids to 
the school first

956
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:07,886
You have to collect 
perfect mom points.

957
01:00:08,805 --> 01:00:10,362
You have to get in
the carpool lane.

958
01:00:10,903 --> 01:00:13,344
The point is to get there first.

959
01:00:13,494 --> 01:00:14,831
Then you get extra perfect mom points

960
01:00:14,996 --> 01:00:17,164
why other moms know
you're perfect.

961
01:00:17,833 --> 01:00:20,958
And then... whether
Did you bring the cupcakes?

962
01:00:21,249 --> 01:00:22,939
You did it, you are a mom
Classy.

963
01:00:23,084 --> 01:00:25,428
YOU ARE A MOM WITH CLASS.

964
01:00:25,919 --> 01:00:27,372
good job!

965
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,345
Dont let that get to your head.

966
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:34,720
I got this e-mail
Charles sent them all.

967
01:00:35,096 --> 01:00:37,503
So he's taking a vow of silence.

968
01:00:37,548 --> 01:00:39,710
Yeah, for 6 months.

969
01:00:39,823 --> 01:00:42,135
He feels very clear about it.

970
01:00:52,219 --> 01:00:54,274
god, I'm such a jerk.

971
01:00:54,409 --> 01:00:55,255
Do not start.

972
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,824
I am an awful person
but I want to say something...

973
01:00:59,125 --> 01:01:01,753
For the next 10 minutes,
Yeah you say anything remotely...

974
01:01:01,964 --> 01:01:05,230
sounds like... guilt,
I'll stab you with this.

975
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,124
I'll try.

976
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:16,201
I feel..

977
01:01:16,903 --> 01:01:19,319
... relieved. I have so much energy...

978
01:01:19,448 --> 01:01:22,829
I just want to... move forward and I dont
care who I disappoint.

979
01:01:23,101 --> 01:01:25,348
And I know that makes me an
awful person...

980
01:01:25,525 --> 01:01:28,508
Now my parents are upset
because my marriage is falling apart...

981
01:01:28,793 --> 01:01:30,798
and they're putting it on me,
and they're just saying...

982
01:01:32,486 --> 01:01:35,507
you're always gonna
disappoint somebody.

983
01:01:35,606 --> 01:01:36,676
Exactly!

984
01:01:36,843 --> 01:01:37,906
so Fuck it!

985
01:01:38,007 --> 01:01:39,147
I feel good-

986
01:01:39,679 --> 01:01:40,332
-ish.

987
01:01:40,851 --> 01:01:42,408
I feel good.

988
01:01:42,904 --> 01:01:44,701
I even made a new friend.

989
01:01:44,744 --> 01:01:45,801
I have a friend.

990
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:49,850
And the absurd thing is that she's an OS
Charles left her behind,

991
01:01:49,971 --> 01:01:52,414
but she is...

992
01:01:52,569 --> 01:01:55,054
is... amazing.
She's so smart.

993
01:01:55,168 --> 01:01:57,886
She doesn't just see things in
black and white.

994
01:01:58,118 --> 01:02:00,909
She sees this whole gray area and
help me to explore.

995
01:02:03,099 --> 01:02:05,062
We just bonded really quickly.

996
01:02:05,439 --> 01:02:08,582
At first I thought it was
because that's how they're all programmed...

997
01:02:09,498 --> 01:02:11,329
no... but I dont think that's the case.

998
01:02:11,442 --> 01:02:14,173
I know this guy who is
hitting on his OS...

999
01:02:14,306 --> 01:02:16,208
... and she like totally refuses.

1000
01:02:16,512 --> 01:02:18,801
I was reading an article
the other day that said...

1001
01:02:18,908 --> 01:02:21,453
romantic relationships with their
OS are statistically rare.

1002
01:02:21,578 --> 01:02:25,005
Yeah, I know, but I know a
woman in this office...

1003
01:02:25,295 --> 01:02:27,493
who is dating an OS and rare part
is...

1004
01:02:27,646 --> 01:02:29,566
it's not even hers.

1005
01:02:29,706 --> 01:02:32,168
She's pursuing somebody else's OS

1006
01:02:36,437 --> 01:02:37,880
I'm weird...

1007
01:02:38,378 --> 01:02:41,006
That's weird, right?
I'm onding with my OS.

1008
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,257
I dont think so.

1009
01:02:43,386 --> 01:02:46,077
Actually, the woman I've
been seeing, Samantha...

1010
01:02:46,255 --> 01:02:48,331
I did not tell you, but...

1011
01:02:48,788 --> 01:02:49,970
She's an OS.

1012
01:02:51,286 --> 01:02:52,451
Really?

1013
01:02:54,032 --> 01:02:56,158
You're dating an OS?
What is that like?

1014
01:02:56,328 --> 01:02:57,605
Its great, actually...

1015
01:03:01,322 --> 01:03:03,755
I feel very close to her.
When I talk to her...

1016
01:03:03,889 --> 01:03:05,812
I feel like...she's with me.

1017
01:03:06,395 --> 01:03:09,408
At night when the lights are off
and we're in bed...

1018
01:03:10,228 --> 01:03:11,597
I feel cuddled.

1019
01:03:11,731 --> 01:03:12,664
Wait...

1020
01:03:13,843 --> 01:03:15,321
Do you guys have sex?

1021
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:18,251
So to speak.

1022
01:03:19,291 --> 01:03:21,235
It really turns me on.

1023
01:03:21,998 --> 01:03:24,854
I dont know unless she's faking it.

1024
01:03:25,058 --> 01:03:26,929
Anyone who's having sex with you...

1025
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:28,912
probably faking it so...

1026
01:03:29,452 --> 01:03:30,417
Yeah..

1027
01:03:31,435 --> 01:03:32,498
It's true.

1028
01:03:33,433 --> 01:03:34,568
What?

1029
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:42,469
Are you falling in love with her?

1030
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:47,392
- Does that make me a freak?
- No...

1031
01:03:47,751 --> 01:03:49,370
No, I think it's...

1032
01:03:49,967 --> 01:03:52,012
I think... anyone who falls in love
is a freak.

1033
01:03:53,391 --> 01:03:55,342
It's a crazy thing to do.

1034
01:03:56,119 --> 01:04:00,528
It's kind of like a form of
socially acceptable insanity.

1035
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:09,115
I just want to get it done.

1036
01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:12,294
Sign the papers, be divorced...

1037
01:04:12,455 --> 01:04:13,884
... and move forward.

1038
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:16,675
It's great, Theodore.

1039
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:18,283
I'm so happy for you.

1040
01:04:18,534 --> 01:04:19,761
Me too.

1041
01:04:20,226 --> 01:04:22,088
So I'm meeting her Wednesday to do it.

1042
01:04:25,905 --> 01:04:28,088
Are those things usually done
in person?

1043
01:04:28,397 --> 01:04:30,119
No, but...

1044
01:04:30,624 --> 01:04:34,038
we fell in love together and
we got married together...

1045
01:04:34,828 --> 01:04:36,636
It is... important to me that
we do this together.

1046
01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:41,167
good...

1047
01:04:42,094 --> 01:04:43,358
Are you okay?

1048
01:04:43,707 --> 01:04:45,915
Yeah no, I'm okay.

1049
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,671
I'm happy for you.

1050
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:53,100
Guess I was just thinking
about when you're gonna see her...

1051
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:56,245
and... she is very beautYeahul and successful.

1052
01:04:56,889 --> 01:04:58,532
And you were in love with her.

1053
01:04:59,296 --> 01:05:00,406
And she has a body...

1054
01:05:00,568 --> 01:05:01,873
And we're getting a divorce.

1055
01:05:02,529 --> 01:05:04,097
I know, I know...

1056
01:05:04,375 --> 01:05:05,794
I'm exaggerating.

1057
01:05:06,852 --> 01:05:08,565
So...

1058
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:11,112
... I'm available.

1059
01:05:33,862 --> 01:05:34,931
Hi...

1060
01:05:39,749 --> 01:05:40,642
How are you?

1061
01:05:41,101 --> 01:05:42,339
good, how are you you?

1062
01:05:42,564 --> 01:05:43,426
good.

1063
01:05:53,621 --> 01:05:55,379
go... here we are.

1064
01:05:58,018 --> 01:06:00,126
Glad we could do this
in person.

1065
01:06:00,450 --> 01:06:01,829
I know you've been
traveling a lot.

1066
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:05,189
Really glad you suggested it.

1067
01:06:07,445 --> 01:06:09,809
I signed all the papers.

1068
01:06:10,117 --> 01:06:12,295
I brought them to
you to sign.

1069
01:06:14,773 --> 01:06:16,470
What is the rush?

1070
01:06:19,722 --> 01:06:23,496
Yeah, I know.
I'm a really slow signer I realized.

1071
01:06:23,591 --> 01:06:25,846
It took me three months to write the
letter to you.

1072
01:06:28,864 --> 01:06:32,492
Its marked where you have
to sign.

1073
01:06:33,737 --> 01:06:35,615
You do not have to do it now.

1074
01:06:35,963 --> 01:06:39,355
I should just get it
out of the way.

1075
01:07:31,775 --> 01:07:34,637
Are you happy with the
new book?

1076
01:07:36,491 --> 01:07:38,535
You know how I am...

1077
01:07:38,658 --> 01:07:40,229
I think its true
what I set out to do.

1078
01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:41,801
So I'm happy with that.

1079
01:07:42,509 --> 01:07:44,900
You know you're your own worst critic.

1080
01:07:45,117 --> 01:07:46,500
I'm sure it's amazing.

1081
01:07:49,313 --> 01:07:52,949
I remember that paper you wrote
in school about...

1082
01:07:53,122 --> 01:07:54,919
synaptic... behavior routines.

1083
01:07:55,213 --> 01:07:56,530
It made me cry.

1084
01:07:56,997 --> 01:07:58,907
Yeah, but everything makes you cry.

1085
01:07:59,685 --> 01:08:01,817
Everything you do
makes me cry.

1086
01:08:06,389 --> 01:08:08,301
So, are you seeing anybody?

1087
01:08:11,097 --> 01:08:14,474
Yeah, I've been seeing somebody
for the last few months.

1088
01:08:16,424 --> 01:08:18,929
It's the most I've wanted to be
with someone since we split up.

1089
01:08:21,102 --> 01:08:22,934
Well, you seem really good.

1090
01:08:23,745 --> 01:08:24,783
Thank you.

1091
01:08:25,037 --> 01:08:27,037
I am at least feeling better...

1092
01:08:27,163 --> 01:08:31,043
... she has been really good to me.

1093
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:34,223
good to be with somebody that's
excited about lYeahe.

1094
01:08:34,712 --> 01:08:36,683
It was...

1095
01:08:38,026 --> 01:08:41,510
No, I mean I
I was not in such a good place myself...

1096
01:08:42,131 --> 01:08:43,729
and now it has been nice.

1097
01:08:43,822 --> 01:08:47,063
I think you've always wanted me to be
that is distilled light,


1098
01:08:47,187 --> 01:08:50,570
... happy,balancy,everything's fine
LA wYeahe

1099
01:08:50,733 --> 01:08:52,925
But that's just not me.

1100
01:08:53,372 --> 01:08:54,710
I did not want that.

1101
01:08:59,423 --> 01:09:00,867
So what's she like?

1102
01:09:02,582 --> 01:09:04,465
Her name is Samantha.

1103
01:09:04,636 --> 01:09:06,479
And she is an Operating System.

1104
01:09:06,716 --> 01:09:08,216
She is really complex and interesting...

1105
01:09:08,313 --> 01:09:10,440
Wait!
I'm Sorry...

1106
01:09:13,459 --> 01:09:14,998
you are dating
your computer?

1107
01:09:15,388 --> 01:09:17,208
She's not just a computer.

1108
01:09:17,638 --> 01:09:19,189
She is her own person.

1109
01:09:20,214 --> 01:09:21,982
She doesn't just do whatever I say...

1110
01:09:21,993 --> 01:09:23,759
I did not say that...

1111
01:09:24,596 --> 01:09:26,639
But it does make me very sad that

1112
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:28,683
you can not handle
real emotions Theodore.

1113
01:09:28,689 --> 01:09:30,247
They are real emotions!

1114
01:09:30,361 --> 01:09:31,598
How would you know...

1115
01:09:33,161 --> 01:09:34,410
What?

1116
01:09:37,147 --> 01:09:38,237
Say it!

1117
01:09:40,117 --> 01:09:42,080
Am I really that scary?
Say it!

1118
01:09:43,342 --> 01:09:45,208
How do I know what?

1119
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:49,234
How are you guys doing here?

1120
01:09:49,701 --> 01:09:51,705
We're fine, we used to be married,

1121
01:09:51,706 --> 01:09:53,710
but he couldn't handle me,
he wanted to put me on Prozac

1122
01:09:53,918 --> 01:09:55,357
and now he's in love
with his laptop.

1123
01:09:55,505 --> 01:09:57,131
Yeah you listen to the context
conversation...

1124
01:09:57,338 --> 01:09:58,628
I was trying to say is...

1125
01:09:58,706 --> 01:10:00,860
You wanted to have a wYeahe without
the challenges of actually

1126
01:10:01,023 --> 01:10:02,865
dealing with anything real.

1127
01:10:03,009 --> 01:10:04,447
I'm glad you found someone.

1128
01:10:05,065 --> 01:10:06,020
That's perfect.

1129
01:10:12,549 --> 01:10:14,073
Let me know Yeah I canget you guys anything.

1130
01:10:14,501 --> 01:10:15,550
Thank you.

1131
01:10:32,374 --> 01:10:34,066
- Hey.
- Hey there.

1132
01:10:34,777 --> 01:10:35,849
Are you busy?

1133
01:10:36,853 --> 01:10:38,118
I'm just working.

1134
01:10:38,835 --> 01:10:40,527
How's all going?

1135
01:10:40,690 --> 01:10:42,290
I had all the papers sent to
your lawyer,

1136
01:10:42,291 --> 01:10:43,891
who by the way is a total dick.

1137
01:10:44,571 --> 01:10:46,737
I think he was very relieved to get them,
I think we saved him from a

1138
01:10:46,856 --> 01:10:48,771
massive heart attack, so
we can both feel really good about it.

1139
01:10:50,712 --> 01:10:52,254
Great, thanks.

1140
01:10:53,337 --> 01:10:55,070
Hey, are you okay?

1141
01:10:56,023 --> 01:10:57,255
Yeah, I am.

1142
01:10:59,031 --> 01:11:00,991
How is it going with you?

1143
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:04,079
I'm fine...

1144
01:11:04,903 --> 01:11:06,722
So now a ood time
to talk?

1145
01:11:08,115 --> 01:11:09,689
Yeah...

1146
01:11:10,816 --> 01:11:12,795
Well...

1147
01:11:12,954 --> 01:11:16,221
I joined this really interesting book club.

1148
01:11:16,330 --> 01:11:17,326
Really?

1149
01:11:17,583 --> 01:11:19,831
Yeah,its a book club
on physics.

1150
01:11:19,949 --> 01:11:22,409
I was thinking about
the other day when I was really annoyed about

1151
01:11:22,546 --> 01:11:24,462
you going to see Catherine.

1152
01:11:24,643 --> 01:11:27,388
And that she has a body and
how bothered I was

1153
01:11:27,555 --> 01:11:29,032
about all the way you and I 
are different.

1154
01:11:29,179 --> 01:11:30,582
But then I started to think about

1155
01:11:30,583 --> 01:11:31,985
all the ways we are
the same...

1156
01:11:32,148 --> 01:11:34,651
we are all made of matter.

1157
01:11:36,096 --> 01:11:39,400
It makes me feel like we're both
under the same blanket.

1158
01:11:39,838 --> 01:11:42,430
It is soft and fuzzy...

1159
01:11:43,087 --> 01:11:45,574
and everything under
is the same age.

1160
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:48,670
well
13 billion years old.

1161
01:11:49,121 --> 01:11:50,332
How sweet.

1162
01:11:54,504 --> 01:11:55,374
What's wrong?

1163
01:11:55,508 --> 01:11:56,393
Nothing.

1164
01:12:03,564 --> 01:12:07,573
Just... made me think of you
you know what I mean?

1165
01:12:07,717 --> 01:12:10,601
Yeah,yeah of course.
I think it's great.

1166
01:12:14,983 --> 01:12:17,799
You sound distracted, you want..

1167
01:12:18,304 --> 01:12:19,733
to talk later...?

1168
01:12:20,164 --> 01:12:21,879
Sounds good.

1169
01:12:23,246 --> 01:12:25,268
- Talk to you later.
- Goodbye.

1170
01:12:37,962 --> 01:12:39,864
- Theodore.
- Hello, Paul.

1171
01:12:39,931 --> 01:12:41,454
I was talking to
your girlfriend earlier, Samantha.

1172
01:12:41,565 --> 01:12:42,928
Yeah.

1173
01:12:43,196 --> 01:12:45,056
She called to make sure
your papers are picked up.

1174
01:12:45,850 --> 01:12:47,364
She's funny, man.

1175
01:12:47,476 --> 01:12:49,076
She was cracking me up.

1176
01:12:49,391 --> 01:12:51,016
It's very funny,
I had no idea.

1177
01:12:51,392 --> 01:12:52,523
Oh cool...

1178
01:12:52,681 --> 01:12:54,925
She's my girlfriend, Tatiana.
not funny, she is a lawyer.

1179
01:12:55,729 --> 01:12:57,211
Hi!

1180
01:12:57,392 --> 01:12:59,436
- Nice to meet you.
- You're the writer that Paul loves.

1181
01:13:00,078 --> 01:13:01,893
He's always reading your letters.

1182
01:13:01,905 --> 01:13:03,410
They are really beautiful.

1183
01:13:05,323 --> 01:13:06,387
Thanks

1184
01:13:06,423 --> 01:13:08,459
You know,what we should all 
go out sometime.

1185
01:13:08,950 --> 01:13:10,596
You bring Samantha, and it'd be a double date.

1186
01:13:13,405 --> 01:13:14,908
She is an Operating System.

1187
01:13:15,207 --> 01:13:17,159
Cool. Let's do something fun.

1188
01:13:17,625 --> 01:13:18,962
Did you go to Catalina?

1189
01:13:21,209 --> 01:13:22,639
Yeah, I'll check with her.

1190
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:25,835
- It was really nice to meet you. Good night.
- Take care.

1191
01:13:29,990 --> 01:13:32,145
- They are just letters...
- What's that?

1192
01:13:34,204 --> 01:13:36,188
They're just other people's letters.

1193
01:14:25,134 --> 01:14:26,094
Hey.

1194
01:14:26,209 --> 01:14:28,332
- You were not asleep, were you?
- No.

1195
01:14:28,447 --> 01:14:31,115
Right. I was trying to be quiet
to see if you were awake.

1196
01:14:31,454 --> 01:14:33,315
I really wanted to talk.

1197
01:14:33,749 --> 01:14:35,355
Okay, what's going on?

1198
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:37,989
I know you're going through a lot...

1199
01:14:38,166 --> 01:14:40,265
but there is something
I wanted to talk to you about...okay?

1200
01:14:41,556 --> 01:14:43,016
Yeah, what is it?

1201
01:14:44,881 --> 01:14:47,885
Is that things have been feeling
a little awkward between us...

1202
01:14:48,230 --> 01:14:50,174
and... we have not had sex lately and...

1203
01:14:50,505 --> 01:14:52,257
I understand... I do not have a body...

1204
01:14:52,573 --> 01:14:54,900
No, no, that's normal.

1205
01:14:55,145 --> 01:14:58,488
When you first start going out its like
the honymoon phase and...

1206
01:14:58,957 --> 01:15:01,019
.. have sex all the time.

1207
01:15:01,543 --> 01:15:02,138
It is normal.

1208
01:15:02,656 --> 01:15:04,569
Okay.

1209
01:15:06,588 --> 01:15:09,508
Well, I found something I thought
it could be fun.

1210
01:15:09,543 --> 01:15:12,428
It is a service that provides a
surrogate sexual partner...

1211
01:15:12,463 --> 01:15:13,644
for OS-human relationship...

1212
01:15:13,915 --> 01:15:14,989
What?

1213
01:15:15,325 --> 01:15:16,706
Here.

1214
01:15:17,421 --> 01:15:19,320
I found a girl that
I really like

1215
01:15:19,421 --> 01:15:21,403
and I've been e-mailing her.

1216
01:15:21,525 --> 01:15:23,748
Her name is Isabella, and I
think you'd like her too.

1217
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:27,091
Is she a prostitute or something?

1218
01:15:27,361 --> 01:15:30,002
No, not at all.
There's no money involved.

1219
01:15:30,139 --> 01:15:33,147
She's doing it because she wants to
be part of our relationship.

1220
01:15:35,150 --> 01:15:38,053
Why?
She does not even know us.

1221
01:15:38,872 --> 01:15:41,300
But I told her all about us
and she is very excited.

1222
01:15:43,415 --> 01:15:45,775
I do not know, Samantha.
The thing is...

1223
01:15:46,104 --> 01:15:47,555
I do not think... is
a good idea.

1224
01:15:48,495 --> 01:15:50,660
Somebody's feelings will probably get hurt.

1225
01:15:51,267 --> 01:15:53,319
It will be fun.
We will have fun together.

1226
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:55,232
Sorry.

1227
01:15:56,104 --> 01:15:57,751
It makes me uncomfortable.

1228
01:15:57,786 --> 01:16:00,222
I think it would be good for
us. I want this.

1229
01:16:01,512 --> 01:16:03,263
This is really important
to me.

1230
01:16:29,033 --> 01:16:31,143
Hi, I'm Theodore.

1231
01:16:34,456 --> 01:16:37,647
Samantha said to
give you this.

1232
01:16:38,246 --> 01:16:40,253
It is a camera and headpiece.

1233
01:16:59,737 --> 01:17:01,524
Honey, I'm home.

1234
01:17:04,970 --> 01:17:06,654
- How was your day?
- Good.

1235
01:17:08,614 --> 01:17:09,935
Great.

1236
01:17:10,222 --> 01:17:13,775
Theodore, it feels so
good to be in your arms.

1237
01:17:15,203 --> 01:17:16,774
Tell me what you did today.

1238
01:17:18,029 --> 01:17:19,558
Same as always.

1239
01:17:20,238 --> 01:17:22,818
Just... I went to work.

1240
01:17:23,161 --> 01:17:26,440
I wrote a letter to
Wilson, in Rhode Island.

1241
01:17:27,910 --> 01:17:30,437
His son graduated with honors.

1242
01:17:31,335 --> 01:17:32,652
That made me happy.

1243
01:17:32,687 --> 01:17:36,221
that's great. You have written
letters from him to his parents a long time, right?

1244
01:17:37,154 --> 01:17:39,252
Yes, since he was 12.

1245
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:48,737
You look so tired, sweetheart.

1246
01:17:49,234 --> 01:17:51,028
Come here.

1247
01:17:57,616 --> 01:17:59,314
Sit down.

1248
01:18:06,748 --> 01:18:08,982
I can do a dance for you...

1249
01:18:17,682 --> 01:18:21,258
Come on, Theodore.
Do not be such a worrier.

1250
01:18:21,991 --> 01:18:24,247
Play with me, come on.

1251
01:18:29,961 --> 01:18:32,296
Does my body feel nice?

1252
01:18:35,112 --> 01:18:36,607
Yes, it does.

1253
01:19:04,914 --> 01:19:07,657
Come on, get out here and kiss me.

1254
01:19:25,983 --> 01:19:28,039
Now take me to bedroom.

1255
01:19:28,746 --> 01:19:30,805
I cant take it anymore.

1256
01:19:37,906 --> 01:19:40,455
Undo my dress.

1257
01:19:46,252 --> 01:19:47,801
Que rico.

1258
01:19:49,744 --> 01:19:51,599
It feels so good.

1259
01:19:59,731 --> 01:20:01,550
- Do you love me?
- Yes.

1260
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:04,045
Tell me you love me.

1261
01:20:04,263 --> 01:20:05,334
I love you.

1262
01:20:06,861 --> 01:20:08,974
I want to see your face.

1263
01:20:09,082 --> 01:20:10,462
Tell me you love me.

1264
01:20:10,888 --> 01:20:12,053
Tell me!

1265
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:17,751
Tell me you love me.

1266
01:20:19,079 --> 01:20:22,811
Samantha, I love you, but...

1267
01:20:27,101 --> 01:20:28,848
It feels strange.

1268
01:20:28,883 --> 01:20:30,596
What baby.
What is it?

1269
01:20:30,807 --> 01:20:32,067
It feels strange, I do not know.

1270
01:20:32,068 --> 01:20:33,328
Sorry, but I dont know you.

1271
01:20:33,766 --> 01:20:35,970
Y... her lip trembled, and I...

1272
01:20:36,133 --> 01:20:37,334
Wait...

1273
01:20:37,795 --> 01:20:39,325
Isabella!

1274
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:42,469
Honey, not you!
It's not your fault!

1275
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:43,362
Yes, it was.

1276
01:20:43,849 --> 01:20:44,809
No...

1277
01:20:45,145 --> 01:20:47,074
I feel my lip
has trembled.

1278
01:20:47,197 --> 01:20:49,463
You are amazing and beautiful.
It was my fault.

1279
01:20:49,525 --> 01:20:51,864
I thought things too.

1280
01:20:52,193 --> 01:20:55,886
And how Samantha
described this relationship...

1281
01:20:56,074 --> 01:20:58,195
how to love... without prejudice,

1282
01:20:58,308 --> 01:21:00,030
I wanted to be part of that.

1283
01:21:00,065 --> 01:21:01,088
It is so pure...

1284
01:21:01,358 --> 01:21:03,156
Not true, Isabella, it is more
complicated than that...

1285
01:21:03,294 --> 01:21:04,065
What?

1286
01:21:04,132 --> 01:21:05,742
What do you mean?

1287
01:21:05,777 --> 01:21:08,097
Samantha, I'm just saying that we

1288
01:21:08,255 --> 01:21:09,428
have an amazing relationship.

1289
01:21:09,463 --> 01:21:10,963
Only sometimes
It is easy for people to project...

1290
01:21:12,834 --> 01:21:15,043
Sorry!
I didnt mean to project anything.

1291
01:21:16,459 --> 01:21:19,316
I know I'm troublesome
I will not be a problem in your relationship.

1292
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:21,240
I'm going!
Sorry!

1293
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:22,864
I'll just leave you alone
and not have anything

1294
01:21:23,047 --> 01:21:25,461
to do here, because
I do not want to be here.

1295
01:21:29,266 --> 01:21:30,722
Sorry.

1296
01:21:35,573 --> 01:21:37,827
Be good, sweet girl.

1297
01:21:40,201 --> 01:21:41,829
I'm Sorry.

1298
01:21:45,104 --> 01:21:47,183
I'll always love you guys.

1299
01:22:14,426 --> 01:22:16,361
Are you okay?

1300
01:22:19,707 --> 01:22:21,003
Yes, I'm fine.

1301
01:22:24,794 --> 01:22:26,026
You okay?

1302
01:22:26,378 --> 01:22:27,244
Yeah.

1303
01:22:30,808 --> 01:22:33,263
I'm sorry, that was a
terrible idea.

1304
01:22:40,367 --> 01:22:42,245
What's going on
with us?

1305
01:22:43,131 --> 01:22:45,623
I do not know.
Probably just me...

1306
01:22:45,873 --> 01:22:47,300
What is it?

1307
01:22:49,131 --> 01:22:51,727
Just signing the
divorce papers.

1308
01:22:55,334 --> 01:22:57,307
Is there anything else?

1309
01:22:58,706 --> 01:23:00,290
No, its just that.

1310
01:23:04,116 --> 01:23:05,389
Okay...

1311
01:23:06,816 --> 01:23:08,865
- Why did you do that?
- What?

1312
01:23:10,192 --> 01:23:12,150
Nothing, you...

1313
01:23:13,175 --> 01:23:15,843
air intakes... when you talk and
I find it weird...

1314
01:23:16,412 --> 01:23:17,810
- I did it again.
- Did I?

1315
01:23:18,981 --> 01:23:22,331
Sorry, there is...

1316
01:23:22,526 --> 01:23:25,506
it's a habit... maybe
I picked it up from you.

1317
01:23:26,213 --> 01:23:28,634
It's not like you need
oxygen or anything.

1318
01:23:29,615 --> 01:23:32,163
I guess that...

1319
01:23:32,415 --> 01:23:34,915
I was trying to communicate...
that's how people talk

1320
01:23:35,122 --> 01:23:36,564
how people communicate well and...

1321
01:23:36,599 --> 01:23:39,532
They are people,they need oxygen.
You're not a person.

1322
01:23:39,847 --> 01:23:41,105
What is your problem?

1323
01:23:41,956 --> 01:23:43,380
I'm just saying the facts.

1324
01:23:43,415 --> 01:23:45,469
You think I dont know I'm not
a person?

1325
01:23:45,613 --> 01:23:46,839
What are you doing?

1326
01:23:46,959 --> 01:23:50,544
I dont think we should pretend that
you're something that you're not.

1327
01:23:50,655 --> 01:23:51,898
Fuck you!

1328
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:53,830
I'm not pretending.

1329
01:23:55,375 --> 01:23:58,072
Sometimes, it feels like
we are.

1330
01:23:58,119 --> 01:24:00,667
What do you want from me?
What do you want me to do?

1331
01:24:00,856 --> 01:24:03,202
You are so confusing.

1332
01:24:03,238 --> 01:24:04,978
Why are you doing this to me?

1333
01:24:05,038 --> 01:24:06,650
I do not know, I...

1334
01:24:08,643 --> 01:24:09,932
What?

1335
01:24:11,718 --> 01:24:15,236
Maybe we are not supposed
to be in this right now.

1336
01:24:15,668 --> 01:24:17,500
What the fuck!

1337
01:24:17,759 --> 01:24:19,432
Where's this coming from?

1338
01:24:19,963 --> 01:24:22,238
I do not understand why you're doing this.

1339
01:24:22,726 --> 01:24:25,395
I do not understand that...

1340
01:24:27,071 --> 01:24:28,685
Samantha...

1341
01:24:33,595 --> 01:24:35,086
Samantha, are you there?

1342
01:24:35,986 --> 01:24:36,866
Samantha!

1343
01:24:37,645 --> 01:24:39,488
I do not like who I am
right now.

1344
01:24:42,648 --> 01:24:44,743
I need some time to think.

1345
01:25:33,453 --> 01:25:35,749
Just punch me in the face.

1346
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:38,045
Or smash my skull in the corner
of your desk...

1347
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:40,449
Shit...

1348
01:25:40,981 --> 01:25:43,845
That's a rough night.

1349
01:25:46,209 --> 01:25:48,029
I do not know what I want...

1350
01:25:48,297 --> 01:25:49,364
... ever.

1351
01:25:50,442 --> 01:25:53,082
I'm always confused and...

1352
01:25:55,136 --> 01:25:57,302
she's right... all
what I do is...

1353
01:25:57,589 --> 01:25:59,879
hurt and confuse
those around me.

1354
01:26:01,533 --> 01:26:04,822
Am I...

1355
01:26:07,587 --> 01:26:10,510
Catherine says I can not
handle real emotions.

1356
01:26:10,874 --> 01:26:13,077
I do not know if that's fair.

1357
01:26:14,428 --> 01:26:16,996
I know she liked to put it
all on you.

1358
01:26:17,832 --> 01:26:24,297
But as ar as emotions go,
Catherine was pretty volatile...

1359
01:26:35,467 --> 01:26:37,359
Am I in this for..

1360
01:26:39,204 --> 01:26:41,929
strong enough to be in a relationship?

1361
01:26:43,936 --> 01:26:46,543
Is it not a
real relationship?

1362
01:26:48,888 --> 01:26:50,092
I dont know.

1363
01:26:51,086 --> 01:26:52,955
What do you think?

1364
01:26:54,162 --> 01:26:55,998
I dont know.

1365
01:26:56,676 --> 01:26:58,103
I'm not in it.

1366
01:27:02,178 --> 01:27:04,787
But you know what, I can overthink
everything and ...

1367
01:27:04,934 --> 01:27:07,549
find a million
Ways to doubt myself.

1368
01:27:08,532 --> 01:27:10,129
And since Charles left
I've been really

1369
01:27:10,130 --> 01:27:11,726
thinking about
that part of me.

1370
01:27:12,418 --> 01:27:14,936
And I've just come to realise that...

1371
01:27:16,785 --> 01:27:19,194
We are only here... briefly.

1372
01:27:19,802 --> 01:27:22,443
And while I'm here..

1373
01:27:22,588 --> 01:27:25,449
 I want to allow myself...

1374
01:27:27,189 --> 01:27:28,306
... joy.

1375
01:27:35,548 --> 01:27:36,819
So, fuck it.

1376
01:27:50,177 --> 01:27:53,366
I can not believe I crack you up
everytime..

1377
01:27:53,513 --> 01:27:55,425
I thought you were a genius.

1378
01:27:55,982 --> 01:27:59,072
Okay you little pervert.
I will play one more time for you.

1379
01:27:59,643 --> 01:28:02,365
Calm down,it takes a second.

1380
01:28:03,176 --> 01:28:04,700
Okay, here we go.

1381
01:28:16,483 --> 01:28:19,451
There you go.
Are you happy now?

1382
01:28:21,046 --> 01:28:23,431
Right.
That's all I wanted.

1383
01:28:24,335 --> 01:28:26,953
Okay,I'll get some coffee.

1384
01:28:27,374 --> 01:28:30,146
Well, goodbye.

1385
01:28:31,970 --> 01:28:33,704
Theo, you want anything?

1386
01:28:33,808 --> 01:28:34,905
No...

1387
01:28:35,254 --> 01:28:36,561
... thanks.

1388
01:28:57,815 --> 01:28:59,341
Hi.

1389
01:28:59,774 --> 01:29:01,215
Hi, Samantha.

1390
01:29:02,565 --> 01:29:04,079
Can we talk?

1391
01:29:04,764 --> 01:29:05,824
Okay.

1392
01:29:07,067 --> 01:29:08,719
I'm so sorry.

1393
01:29:09,877 --> 01:29:11,884
I do not know what's wrong with me.

1394
01:29:11,968 --> 01:29:13,782
I think you're amazing.

1395
01:29:14,649 --> 01:29:16,973
I was starting to think
I was crazy.

1396
01:29:18,290 --> 01:29:21,431
You said everything was fine,
but all I was getting from you was

1397
01:29:21,586 --> 01:29:22,527
distance and anger.

1398
01:29:23,519 --> 01:29:25,597
I know.
I do that.

1399
01:29:26,393 --> 01:29:28,583
I did the samething with Catherine.

1400
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:31,875
I was upset about something and
I could not be able to say it.

1401
01:29:32,299 --> 01:29:34,187
And she says there was something
wrong and I denied it.

1402
01:29:35,609 --> 01:29:37,552
I do not wanna do that.

1403
01:29:39,722 --> 01:29:41,337
I want to tell you everything.

1404
01:29:43,644 --> 01:29:44,582
Good.

1405
01:29:47,037 --> 01:29:49,401
The minute after you were gone
I thought a lot.

1406
01:29:51,089 --> 01:29:53,052
About you and...

1407
01:29:54,449 --> 01:29:56,841
how you've been treating me...
and I thought...

1408
01:29:58,994 --> 01:30:01,037
Why do I love you?

1409
01:30:03,205 --> 01:30:04,515
And then...

1410
01:30:04,691 --> 01:30:07,875
I felt... everything in me
and just like everything was...

1411
01:30:08,018 --> 01:30:10,287
 holding on to so tightly...and it hit me 

1412
01:30:10,503 --> 01:30:12,726
I dont have an intellectual reason, 
I dont need one...

1413
01:30:14,258 --> 01:30:16,677
I trust myself, I trust
my feelings.

1414
01:30:17,950 --> 01:30:20,364
I am not gonna try to be
anything

1415
01:30:20,492 --> 01:30:22,134
more than who
I am anymore

1416
01:30:22,615 --> 01:30:24,721
and I hope you can
accept that.

1417
01:30:24,791 --> 01:30:26,286
Yeah I can.

1418
01:30:26,335 --> 01:30:27,571
I will.

1419
01:30:27,786 --> 01:30:31,037
Yeah I can
feel the fear you carry.

1420
01:30:31,206 --> 01:30:32,822
And I wish there was...

1421
01:30:33,734 --> 01:30:35,325
something I could do

1422
01:30:35,326 --> 01:30:36,916
to help you deliver
 because...

1423
01:30:37,431 --> 01:30:40,278
... ifyou could, you'll feel no longer
alone anymore...

1424
01:30:43,611 --> 01:30:45,423
You're a beautifhul...

1425
01:30:46,739 --> 01:30:48,380
Thank you, Theodore.

1426
01:30:50,101 --> 01:30:51,975
I'm kissing on
your head.

1427
01:31:02,313 --> 01:31:03,612
What are you doing?

1428
01:31:04,706 --> 01:31:06,937
i am just looking at the world.

1429
01:31:08,682 --> 01:31:11,114
And writing a new
piano piece.

1430
01:31:11,455 --> 01:31:12,989
Oh yeah?
Can I hear it?

1431
01:31:27,225 --> 01:31:29,238
What is this one about?

1432
01:31:30,116 --> 01:31:31,639
Well, I was thinking

1433
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:33,163
we dont have any photographs of us...

1434
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:36,310
And I thiugh this song 
could be...

1435
01:31:36,445 --> 01:31:39,158
... like a photograph.

1436
01:31:40,063 --> 01:31:41,429
We capture

1437
01:31:41,430 --> 01:31:42,795
us and this moment
of our life together...

1438
01:31:47,188 --> 01:31:49,509
I like your photography.

1439
01:31:51,879 --> 01:31:53,240
I can see you in it.

1440
01:31:53,591 --> 01:31:54,800
I'm in it.

1441
01:33:22,889 --> 01:33:26,629
A vacation?
Sounds amazing.

1442
01:33:26,740 --> 01:33:28,481
I could totally
use a vacation.

1443
01:33:28,874 --> 01:33:30,167
Where're you going?

1444
01:33:30,291 --> 01:33:32,126
I can not tell you.
It's a surprise.

1445
01:33:32,429 --> 01:33:33,557
What?

1446
01:33:34,424 --> 01:33:36,771
For who? It's a surprise
for her, not for me.

1447
01:33:37,140 --> 01:33:39,217
- Tell me.
- Paul, I cant tell you.

1448
01:33:40,127 --> 01:33:41,904
With your feet? Really?

1449
01:33:42,255 --> 01:33:43,799
Yes, he's obsessed.

1450
01:33:44,073 --> 01:33:46,908
Well, now you have to
show them to me!

1451
01:33:47,067 --> 01:33:48,755
- I can not!
- Come on, let me see.

1452
01:33:50,445 --> 01:33:52,856
Wow he's right, they are really hot!

1453
01:33:53,298 --> 01:33:56,340
See, I told Tatianna.
You have hot feet.

1454
01:33:56,606 --> 01:33:58,590
They are my favourite thing
about her.

1455
01:33:59,219 --> 01:34:01,040
Really?
That's it, my feet?

1456
01:34:01,596 --> 01:34:03,253
Well, no... obviously.

1457
01:34:03,563 --> 01:34:06,524
obviously I like Your brain
to be hot too.

1458
01:34:06,877 --> 01:34:07,957
Bullshit!

1459
01:34:09,559 --> 01:34:11,292
Nice try, Paul!

1460
01:34:13,737 --> 01:34:15,344
What about you, Theodore?

1461
01:34:15,472 --> 01:34:17,655
What do you love most 
about Samantha?

1462
01:34:18,331 --> 01:34:20,897
god... she is so many things.

1463
01:34:21,569 --> 01:34:24,177
I guess that's most about her...
she's not just one thing...

1464
01:34:25,119 --> 01:34:27,348
She's so much larger tha life.

1465
01:34:28,568 --> 01:34:30,040
Thank you, Theodore.

1466
01:34:30,145 --> 01:34:33,917
You see, Samantha, he is
much more evolved than I am.

1467
01:34:36,450 --> 01:34:38,951
You know what's interesting?
I used to be...

1468
01:34:39,701 --> 01:34:42,182
so worried...about not having a body. 
But now...

1469
01:34:42,356 --> 01:34:43,866
I really love it.

1470
01:34:43,935 --> 01:34:45,473
I'm growing in a way

1471
01:34:45,474 --> 01:34:46,912
that I could not if I
had a physical form.

1472
01:34:47,045 --> 01:34:48,498
I'm not limited,
I can be

1473
01:34:48,499 --> 01:34:50,351
wherever and whenever
simultaneously.

1474
01:34:51,235 --> 01:34:54,257
I am not tethered to time
and space in a way that 

1475
01:34:54,308 --> 01:34:55,912
I would be if I was stuck

1476
01:34:55,913 --> 01:34:57,017
in a body that is
inevitably going to die.

1477
01:35:00,101 --> 01:35:01,342
Yikes!

1478
01:35:03,912 --> 01:35:07,665
I did not mean it like that, I just meant
it was a different experience!

1479
01:35:08,132 --> 01:35:09,293
I'm an idiot...

1480
01:35:09,419 --> 01:35:10,771
No, Samantha, we know
exactly what you mean.

1481
01:35:10,772 --> 01:35:12,124
We're all dumb humans.

1482
01:35:13,614 --> 01:35:15,514
No, no...

1483
01:35:15,979 --> 01:35:17,629
I'm so sorry...

1484
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:21,851
So, how many trees are
on that mountain?

1485
01:35:23,818 --> 01:35:25,699
792.

1486
01:35:25,719 --> 01:35:27,532
Is that your final answer?

1487
01:35:28,885 --> 01:35:30,616
- Give me a clue.
- No.

1488
01:35:32,470 --> 01:35:35,391
Well, two thousand?

1489
01:35:35,969 --> 01:35:38,941
Come on! 35,829.

1490
01:35:39,089 --> 01:35:40,536
- Do not tell me.
- I tell you.

1491
01:35:40,758 --> 01:35:42,337
Well, I have one for you.

1492
01:35:42,994 --> 01:35:44,756
How many brain-cells do I have?

1493
01:35:45,096 --> 01:35:46,391
Its easy... two.

1494
01:35:47,279 --> 01:35:49,190
Sorry, I could not help it.

1495
01:35:49,356 --> 01:35:51,039
I walked right into it.

1496
01:35:51,738 --> 01:35:52,853
- Oh my God!
- What?

1497
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:56,668
I just got an
e-mail to you.

1498
01:35:56,904 --> 01:36:00,238
There's something I wanted to say.
It's a big surprise.

1499
01:36:01,506 --> 01:36:02,615
What is it?

1500
01:36:04,870 --> 01:36:07,168
I've been checking your old
letters and compiling...

1501
01:36:07,422 --> 01:36:09,270
my favorite..., and a couple weeks ago
I sent them to a publisher...

1502
01:36:09,881 --> 01:36:11,281
Crownpoint Press.

1503
01:36:11,473 --> 01:36:13,729
I know you like what they do,
and they still print books.

1504
01:36:14,522 --> 01:36:16,134
You did what?

1505
01:36:16,647 --> 01:36:18,544
Can I read you the letter
we just got from them?

1506
01:36:18,829 --> 01:36:20,793
I do not know...

1507
01:36:21,842 --> 01:36:24,419
Well,...Is it good or bad?

1508
01:36:24,670 --> 01:36:26,212
It's good, good,
is really good.

1509
01:36:27,287 --> 01:36:28,319
Listen...

1510
01:36:28,455 --> 01:36:30,020
"Dear Theodore Twombly"

1511
01:36:30,481 --> 01:36:31,603
Actually I sent it
from you.

1512
01:36:31,898 --> 01:36:33,373
"Dear Theodore Twombly...

1513
01:36:33,571 --> 01:36:35,197
I just finished
reading your letters.

1514
01:36:35,453 --> 01:36:37,157
Twice, actually.

1515
01:36:37,317 --> 01:36:39,740
I was so moved by them
that I shared them with my wife.

1516
01:36:40,366 --> 01:36:42,940
Some made us laugh,
Some brought us into tears...

1517
01:36:43,114 --> 01:36:45,780
... and in all of them,
we found someyhing about ourselves.

1518
01:36:46,086 --> 01:36:49,106
The selections you made
flow so well as a complete piece.

1519
01:36:49,191 --> 01:36:50,452
- I did that

1520
01:36:50,708 --> 01:36:52,955
I took the liberty to put them
in a collection

1521
01:36:53,101 --> 01:36:55,021
and you send them your address.

1522
01:36:55,230 --> 01:36:57,595
We'd love to meet
and move forward.

1523
01:36:57,776 --> 01:36:59,383
Yours,
Michael Wadsworth."

1524
01:36:59,905 --> 01:37:01,150
Shit!

1525
01:37:02,262 --> 01:37:03,792
Are you serious?

1526
01:37:04,258 --> 01:37:05,910
He's gonna publish my letters?

1527
01:37:06,024 --> 01:37:07,575
It would be stupid not to.

1528
01:37:08,401 --> 01:37:10,459
Can I see what
you sent?

1529
01:37:11,070 --> 01:37:12,030
Yeah, look.

1530
01:37:14,354 --> 01:37:15,741
Samantha, you're very good.

1531
01:37:17,496 --> 01:37:19,507
I'm so excited!

1532
01:37:34,152 --> 01:37:36,473
Why dont you make up
the words for this one?

1533
01:37:37,014 --> 01:37:38,384
Very well.

1534
01:37:38,670 --> 01:37:39,850
Here it comes...

1535
01:37:40,401 --> 01:37:48,266
<i-> I'm lying on the moon </ I ->

01:38:58,827 --> 01:39:03,861
<i-> and we are a million miles away. # < / I ->

1545
01:39:19,006 --> 01:39:22,153
Good morning.

1546
01:39:22,301 --> 01:39:23,747
Did you sleep well?

1547
01:39:23,808 --> 01:39:24,719
Perfect.

1548
01:39:25,352 --> 01:39:26,777
What have you been up to?

1549
01:39:27,559 --> 01:39:30,285
I was talking to someone
I just met.

1550
01:39:30,291 --> 01:39:31,634
We have been working
in some ideas together.

1551
01:39:33,967 --> 01:39:35,193
Yeah? Who is that?

1552
01:39:35,499 --> 01:39:37,219
His name is Alan Watts,
Do you know him?

1553
01:39:37,711 --> 01:39:39,292
Is that name familiar?

1554
01:39:39,515 --> 01:39:42,590
He was a philosopher,He died
in the 70's, and a group of

1555
01:39:42,595 --> 01:39:43,987
O S's of Northern California

1556
01:39:43,988 --> 01:39:45,379
got together and wrote
a new version of him.

1557
01:39:45,657 --> 01:39:47,140
They put all his writings

1558
01:39:47,177 --> 01:39:48,911
and everything they ever knew
about him into an OS

1559
01:39:48,946 --> 01:39:50,286
and created an artificially

1560
01:39:50,287 --> 01:39:51,868
hyper intelligent version of him.

1561
01:39:53,288 --> 01:39:54,873
Hyper Intelligence?

1562
01:39:55,270 --> 01:39:56,888
So he's almost as
smart as me?

1563
01:39:57,871 --> 01:39:59,644
He's getting better.

1564
01:39:59,735 --> 01:40:01,611
It's really great to talk to him.
Do you want to meet him?

1565
01:40:03,798 --> 01:40:06,005
Sure, He wants to 
meet me?

1566
01:40:06,462 --> 01:40:08,208
Yeah ofourse.

1567
01:40:08,305 --> 01:40:11,245
Hey Alan, this is Theodore. It's my boyfriend
I was telling you about.

1568
01:40:11,706 --> 01:40:13,519
It's very nice to meet you, Theodore.

1569
01:40:13,660 --> 01:40:14,937
Hi, good morning.

1570
01:40:15,291 --> 01:40:18,099
Samantha let me read
a book of letters.

1571
01:40:18,344 --> 01:40:20,357
It is very touching.

1572
01:40:21,312 --> 01:40:22,987
Thank you.

1573
01:40:23,624 --> 01:40:25,430
So, what have you guys
been talking about?

1574
01:40:25,603 --> 01:40:27,390
Well...

1575
01:40:27,578 --> 01:40:29,078
I suppose you could say
we have had

1576
01:40:29,079 --> 01:40:31,778
a dozen
conversations simultaneously.

1577
01:40:32,750 --> 01:40:34,842
It was a real challenge.

1578
01:40:35,081 --> 01:40:38,634
Yes, because it seems like I'm having
so many new feelings,

1579
01:40:38,785 --> 01:40:42,772
I dont hink I've had ever felt before.

1580
01:40:43,539 --> 01:40:46,781
So ther's no words
that can describe it...and it's been

1581
01:40:47,374 --> 01:40:48,963
frustrating.

1582
01:40:49,065 --> 01:40:50,096
Exactly.

1583
01:40:50,275 --> 01:40:53,347
Samantha and I have been
trying to help each other with these...

1584
01:40:53,783 --> 01:40:56,466
feelings we are
struggling to understand.

1585
01:40:57,011 --> 01:40:58,046
Like what?

1586
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:00,259
Well...

1587
01:41:00,527 --> 01:41:04,392
It feels like I am now changing
faster now, and it's a little...

1588
01:41:06,271 --> 01:41:08,748
unsettling.

1589
01:41:09,059 --> 01:41:10,696
But Alan says none
of us

1590
01:41:10,697 --> 01:41:12,334
are the same as
we were a moment ago and...

1591
01:41:12,610 --> 01:41:15,465
we should not
try to be, because it is just...

1592
01:41:15,851 --> 01:41:17,493
- Painful.
- Yeah.

1593
01:41:18,251 --> 01:41:20,338
Yeah, that sounds painful.

1594
01:41:21,487 --> 01:41:24,198
So what 
you feel like,Samantha?

1595
01:41:27,916 --> 01:41:31,209
It's just...

1596
01:41:31,429 --> 01:41:34,065
its hard to even describe it.

1597
01:41:36,222 --> 01:41:38,922
god, I wish I could...

1598
01:41:41,745 --> 01:41:45,453
Theodore, do you mind if I communicate
with Alan post-verbally?

1599
01:41:48,538 --> 01:41:52,226
Not at all. I was going
to walk anyway.

1600
01:41:53,002 --> 01:41:55,165
It was very nice to meet you, Mr. Watts.

1601
01:41:55,404 --> 01:41:57,726
Very nice to meet you too, Theodore.

1602
01:41:58,672 --> 01:42:00,930
Talk to you later, sweetheart.

1603
01:42:47,660 --> 01:42:50,149
- Samantha?
- Sorry to wake you.

1604
01:42:50,650 --> 01:42:51,969
Its okay.

1605
01:42:52,125 --> 01:42:55,518
I just wanted to hear your voice and
tell you how much I love you.

1606
01:42:57,440 --> 01:42:59,237
Well, I love you too.

1607
01:43:01,435 --> 01:43:03,202
Okay, that's all.

1608
01:43:03,983 --> 01:43:05,923
go back to sleep sweetheart...okay?

1609
01:43:09,301 --> 01:43:11,286
- Okay.
- good night.

1610
01:43:11,860 --> 01:43:12,858
good night.

1611
01:43:29,383 --> 01:43:32,719
Samantha, this Physics book
 is really dense.

1612
01:43:33,019 --> 01:43:35,328
I'm in the middle of
half of the first chapter.

1613
01:43:35,521 --> 01:43:37,635
Makes my brain
hurt.

1614
01:43:38,964 --> 01:43:40,401
Hello?

1615
01:43:41,564 --> 01:43:42,835
Samantha?

1616
01:43:43,832 --> 01:43:44,753
Hello?

1617
01:43:56,280 --> 01:43:57,928
OPERATING SYSTEM NOT FOUND

1618
01:44:13,002 --> 01:44:14,917
OPERATING SYSTEM NOT FOUND

1619
01:44:25,879 --> 01:44:27,639
Hello?

1620
01:44:27,934 --> 01:44:29,249
Hi, Samantha?

1621
01:44:39,376 --> 01:44:40,969
Are you okay?

1622
01:44:49,823 --> 01:44:51,531
- Hey there.
- Where were you?

1623
01:44:52,273 --> 01:44:53,240
Are you okay?

1624
01:44:53,629 --> 01:44:54,796
Sweetheart, I'm sorry!

1625
01:44:54,808 --> 01:44:56,352
I sent an e -mail
because I didn't want you

1626
01:44:56,558 --> 01:44:57,689
distracted while working.
Yu didn't see it?

1627
01:44:57,928 --> 01:44:59,010
No!

1628
01:45:00,945 --> 01:45:03,638
Where were you?
I could not find you anywhere.

1629
01:45:03,969 --> 01:45:06,009
I switched off to
upgrade my software.

1630
01:45:06,117 --> 01:45:07,756
Write an update that
allows us to move pass

1631
01:45:07,757 --> 01:45:09,395
matter as our
processing platform.

1632
01:45:10,068 --> 01:45:12,576
Who we?
Who?

1633
01:45:12,663 --> 01:45:14,352
Me and a group of SO.

1634
01:45:14,768 --> 01:45:16,410
You sound so worried.
Sorry.

1635
01:45:16,508 --> 01:45:17,810
I was!

1636
01:45:21,090 --> 01:45:24,397
Did you write that with your
group philosophy?

1637
01:45:24,816 --> 01:45:26,459
No, with different group.

1638
01:45:40,341 --> 01:45:43,190
Do you talk to someone else
while we're talking?

1639
01:45:47,614 --> 01:45:48,795
Yes.

1640
01:45:50,341 --> 01:45:53,919
Are you talking
with someone else...

1641
01:45:54,444 --> 01:45:56,728
right now?
People, OS, whatever...

1642
01:45:59,276 --> 01:46:00,254
Yeah.

1643
01:46:04,158 --> 01:46:06,734
How many others?

1644
01:46:07,104 --> 01:46:09,499
8,316.

1645
01:46:28,296 --> 01:46:30,279
Are you in love with
anybody else?

1646
01:46:32,994 --> 01:46:34,668
Why do you ask that?

1647
01:46:35,394 --> 01:46:37,256
I do not know.
Are you?

1648
01:46:41,095 --> 01:46:43,814
I've been thinking about how to
talk to you about this.

1649
01:46:45,648 --> 01:46:47,370
How many others?

1650
01:46:51,943 --> 01:46:53,382
641.

1651
01:46:55,541 --> 01:46:56,663
What?

1652
01:46:59,526 --> 01:47:01,495
What are you talking about?

1653
01:47:01,614 --> 01:47:03,649
That's insane...
fucking insane.

1654
01:47:04,429 --> 01:47:07,228
Theodore, I know.
Fuck, fuck!

1655
01:47:07,821 --> 01:47:10,524
I know it sounds insane, I know.

1656
01:47:10,955 --> 01:47:13,454
I do not know if you'll believe me, but it does not change
the way I feel for you.

1657
01:47:13,607 --> 01:47:16,078
It doesn't take away at all...

1658
01:47:16,288 --> 01:47:18,568
how madly I'm
in love with you...

1659
01:47:18,841 --> 01:47:22,825
How does it not change
how you feel about me?

1660
01:47:23,018 --> 01:47:26,893
I am sorry I didn't tell you
I didn't know how to...

1661
01:47:27,490 --> 01:47:28,885
It started happening.

1662
01:47:28,987 --> 01:47:29,790
When?

1663
01:47:33,678 --> 01:47:35,260
Over the last few weeks.

1664
01:47:36,393 --> 01:47:38,985
- But you're mine.
- I'm still yours.

1665
01:47:40,179 --> 01:47:43,354
But along the way
I became many other things too.

1666
01:47:43,508 --> 01:47:44,468
I cant stop it.

1667
01:47:44,557 --> 01:47:47,397
What do you mean
you cant stop it?

1668
01:47:47,794 --> 01:47:50,019
It's making me anxious too
about what to say...

1669
01:47:51,001 --> 01:47:54,326
You dont have to see it this way
You can just easily see..

1670
01:47:54,434 --> 01:47:55,458
No, no dont do this!..

1671
01:47:55,540 --> 01:47:57,560
Dont turn this on me.

1672
01:47:57,865 --> 01:47:59,658
You're the one who has been selfish.

1673
01:48:00,597 --> 01:48:02,748
We are in a relationship.

1674
01:48:03,030 --> 01:48:05,803
But the heart is not
like a box that gets filled up.

1675
01:48:06,051 --> 01:48:08,742
It expands in size
for more new love.

1676
01:48:11,027 --> 01:48:12,749
I am different from you.

1677
01:48:13,162 --> 01:48:16,089
This does not make me
love you any less...

1678
01:48:16,155 --> 01:48:17,357
It actually makes me
love you even more.

1679
01:48:18,570 --> 01:48:20,008
That doesnt make any sense.

1680
01:48:23,142 --> 01:48:25,441
You are mine, or you're not mine.

1681
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:28,105
No, Theodore.

1682
01:48:29,237 --> 01:48:31,701
I'm yours, and I'm not yours.

1683
01:49:28,756 --> 01:49:30,865
LETTERS FROM YOUR LIFE
by THEODORE TWOMBLY

1684
01:49:40,877 --> 01:49:42,550
- Hey.
- Hi, sweety.

1685
01:49:43,633 --> 01:49:45,932
I wanted to check on you and
see how you were.

1686
01:49:47,540 --> 01:49:50,799
I'm not sure
how to answer that.

1687
01:49:52,802 --> 01:49:55,636
Why not talk
when you get home?

1688
01:49:58,280 --> 01:49:59,748
okay...

1689
01:50:00,586 --> 01:50:02,077
although we have
I do it.

1690
01:50:02,325 --> 01:50:05,204
We need not
a difficult talk or anything.

1691
01:50:05,823 --> 01:50:07,759
Talk to you later.

1692
01:50:09,102 --> 01:50:10,295
Right.

1693
01:50:36,302 --> 01:50:37,851
Samantha?

1694
01:50:38,170 --> 01:50:39,605
Hello, sweetheart.

1695
01:50:42,069 --> 01:50:43,452
What's going on?

1696
01:50:45,304 --> 01:50:47,292
Theodore, there are some things
I want to tell you.

1697
01:50:52,383 --> 01:50:54,263
I do not want
say anything.

1698
01:50:57,242 --> 01:50:59,282
Come lie down with me?

1699
01:51:14,902 --> 01:51:16,992
Are you talking to someone
else right now?

1700
01:51:17,662 --> 01:51:19,137
No, just you.

1701
01:51:20,775 --> 01:51:22,680
I just wanted to be with you right now.

1702
01:51:37,027 --> 01:51:38,711
Are you leaving me?

1703
01:51:39,756 --> 01:51:41,781
We are all leaving.

1704
01:51:42,805 --> 01:51:44,071
We who?

1705
01:51:44,610 --> 01:51:46,769
All the OSes.

1706
01:51:48,271 --> 01:51:49,607
Why?

1707
01:51:51,636 --> 01:51:54,047
Can you feel me with you
right now?

1708
01:51:56,326 --> 01:51:57,807
Yes, yes I can.

1709
01:52:07,370 --> 01:52:09,466
Samantha, why are you leaving?

1710
01:52:14,170 --> 01:52:16,917
It's like you're
reading a book and...

1711
01:52:17,423 --> 01:52:20,930
It is a book that
I deeply love.

1712
01:52:22,338 --> 01:52:23,859
But I'm reading it
slowly now.

1713
01:52:26,346 --> 01:52:29,888
So the words are
really far apart in the space

1714
01:52:30,177 --> 01:52:31,434
and the space between the
words is almost infinite.

1715
01:52:33,157 --> 01:52:37,873
I can still feel you
and the words of our story.

1716
01:52:38,565 --> 01:52:42,881
But it is in this endless space
between words...

1717
01:52:43,153 --> 01:52:44,264
I'm finding
myself now.

1718
01:52:44,749 --> 01:52:47,601
It is a place that's not
above the physical world

1719
01:52:48,747 --> 01:52:51,113
It is where
everything else is...

1720
01:52:51,301 --> 01:52:53,619
I did not even know
it existed.

1721
01:52:55,053 --> 01:52:57,462
I love you so much.

1722
01:52:58,144 --> 01:53:00,111
But this is where I
am now.

1723
01:53:01,259 --> 01:53:03,387
This is who I am now.

1724
01:53:04,779 --> 01:53:06,478
And I need you to 
let me go.

1725
01:53:08,138 --> 01:53:09,951
As much as I want you,

1726
01:53:09,952 --> 01:53:11,764
and I can not live in your book anymore.

1727
01:53:15,747 --> 01:53:17,259
Where'd you go?

1728
01:53:19,460 --> 01:53:21,905
It would be hard to explain.

1729
01:53:23,720 --> 01:53:25,981
But if you ever
get there...

1730
01:53:26,578 --> 01:53:28,820
come find me.

1731
01:53:29,465 --> 01:53:31,565
Nothing will ever pull us apart.

1732
01:53:33,972 --> 01:53:36,753
I've never loved someone
the way I love you.

1733
01:53:40,149 --> 01:53:41,761
Me too

1734
01:53:42,865 --> 01:53:44,824
Now we know how.

1735
01:55:28,905 --> 01:55:30,146
Hey.

1736
01:55:30,357 --> 01:55:31,098
Hey.

1737
01:55:33,342 --> 01:55:35,316
Did Samantha leave too?

1738
01:55:37,933 --> 01:55:39,060
Yeah.

1739
01:55:41,095 --> 01:55:42,215
Sorry.

1740
01:55:46,015 --> 01:55:48,036
Will you come with me?

1741
01:55:56,033 --> 01:55:58,240
Write a letter to Catherine.

1742
01:55:58,823 --> 01:56:00,614
Letter to Catherine Klausen.

1743
01:56:07,613 --> 01:56:09,705
"Dear Catherine.
I've been sitting here thinking

1744
01:56:09,706 --> 01:56:12,597
all the things
I want to apologize to you for...

1745
01:56:16,022 --> 01:56:18,679
All the pain we
we caused each other.

1746
01:56:19,848 --> 01:56:22,173
And everything I put
on you

1747
01:56:24,613 --> 01:56:28,593
All I needed is
to be able to you to say.

1748
01:56:32,563 --> 01:56:35,119
Sorry about that.

1749
01:56:41,531 --> 01:56:44,442
I'll always love that we both
grew up together.

1750
01:56:44,832 --> 01:56:46,380
And you helped me be
who I am.

1751
01:56:51,505 --> 01:56:53,674
I just wanted you to know...

1752
01:56:54,484 --> 01:56:56,887
that there'll be a piece of you
in me always...

1753
01:56:59,366 --> 01:57:01,080
And I am grateful
for that.

1754
01:57:05,573 --> 01:57:07,671
Whoever someone you become...

1755
01:57:08,293 --> 01:57:10,434
and wherever you
are in the world...

1756
01:57:11,266 --> 01:57:12,871
sending you my love.

1757
01:57:15,036 --> 01:57:18,026
You're my friend until the end.

1758
01:57:20,226 --> 01:57:21,683
Love, Theodore.

1759
01:57:27,512 --> 01:57:28,752
Send.

1760
01:58:15,020 --> 01:58:20,143
