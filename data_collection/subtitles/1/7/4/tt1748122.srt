1
00:01:30,376 --> 00:01:31,626
<i>In order to show you how</i>

2
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:34,209
<i>a big symphony
orchestra is put together,</i>

3
00:01:34,292 --> 00:01:37,376
<i>Benjamin Britten
has written a big piece of music,</i>

4
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:39,209
<i>which is made up
of smaller pieces</i>

5
00:01:39,292 --> 00:01:42,292
<i>that show you all
the separate parts of the orchestra.</i>

6
00:01:42,376 --> 00:01:45,167
<i>These smaller pieces
are called variations,</i>

7
00:01:45,251 --> 00:01:48,751
<i>which means different ways
of playing the same tune.</i>

8
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:52,084
<i>First of all,
he lets us hear the tune or the theme,</i>

9
00:01:52,167 --> 00:01:53,292
<i>which is a beautiful melody</i>

10
00:01:53,376 --> 00:01:56,751
<i>by the much older
British composer Henry Purcell.</i>

11
00:01:56,834 --> 00:02:01,292
<i>Here is Purcell's theme
played by the whole orchestra together.</i>

12
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:34,501
<i>Now, Mr. Britten lets you hear
the four different families of the orchestra</i>

13
00:02:34,584 --> 00:02:37,542
<i>playing the same Purcell theme
in different ways.</i>

14
00:02:37,626 --> 00:02:39,417
<i>First, we hear
the woodwind family.</i>

15
00:02:39,501 --> 00:02:43,167
<i>The flutes, the oboes,
the clarinets and the bassoons.</i>

16
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:07,376
<i>Here comes the brass family.</i>

17
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:10,751
<i>The trumpets, the horns,
the trombones and the tubas.</i>

18
00:03:16,876 --> 00:03:18,251
One to four.

19
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,667
<i>Now, Mr. Britten arranges the Purcell theme
for the string family.</i>

20
00:03:33,751 --> 00:03:34,792
I'm sick of this rain.

21
00:03:34,876 --> 00:03:39,292
<i>The violins,
the violas, the cellos and the double basses.</i>

22
00:03:39,376 --> 00:03:41,751
<i>And of course, the harp.</i>

23
00:04:02,751 --> 00:04:05,126
<i>And finally
the percussion family,</i>

24
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:08,501
<i>all those drums and gongs
and things you hit.</i>

25
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:14,667
<i>After this, you will
hear the theme by Purcell</i>

26
00:04:14,751 --> 00:04:18,667
<i>played once more in its original
form by all four families together.</i>

27
00:04:18,751 --> 00:04:21,042
<i>That is, the whole orchestra.</i>

28
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:47,042
<i>This is
the island of New Penzance.</i>

29
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:50,292
16 miles long.

30
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:54,459
Forested with
old-growth pine and maple.

31
00:04:55,626 --> 00:04:58,209
Criss-crossed by
shallow tidal creeks.

32
00:04:59,334 --> 00:05:01,709
Chickchaw territory.

33
00:05:02,251 --> 00:05:03,292
There are no
paved roads, but...

34
00:05:04,626 --> 00:05:06,584
Here comes Jed
with the mail.

35
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:10,709
But instead many
miles of intersecting footpaths and dirt trails,

36
00:05:10,792 --> 00:05:13,834
and a ferry that
runs twice daily from Stone Cove.

37
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:18,167
The year is 1965.

38
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:22,209
We are on the far edge
of Black Beacon Sound,

39
00:05:22,292 --> 00:05:24,959
famous for the ferocious
and well-documented storm,

40
00:05:25,042 --> 00:05:28,292
which will
strike from the east on the 5th of September.

41
00:05:29,042 --> 00:05:31,542
In three days' time.

42
00:05:47,751 --> 00:05:48,959
Morning, Gadge.

43
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:50,334
Morning, sir.

44
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:01,334
Deluca,
latrine inspection.

45
00:06:10,042 --> 00:06:11,376
Good.

46
00:06:13,501 --> 00:06:15,709
Roosevelt,
how's that lanyard coming?

47
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,876
Horrible.

48
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,709
Skotak,
what's all this lumber for?

49
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:25,126
We're building a tree house.

50
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:26,542
- Where?
- Right here.

51
00:06:29,251 --> 00:06:32,501
That's not a safe altitude.
Why is it up so high?

52
00:06:32,584 --> 00:06:34,667
If someone falls from there,
that's a guaranteed death.

53
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,876
Well, where would
you have built it?

54
00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:38,126
Lower.

55
00:06:44,126 --> 00:06:45,792
Nickleby?
What are you doing?

56
00:06:45,876 --> 00:06:47,501
Pest control.
Burning some ants.

57
00:06:47,584 --> 00:06:49,251
Spot check.

58
00:06:51,292 --> 00:06:53,001
Your socks are down,
your shirt tails are untucked,

59
00:06:53,084 --> 00:06:54,501
your trousers are
not properly pressed.

60
00:06:54,584 --> 00:06:57,042
You are reported for
a uniform violation.

61
00:07:00,084 --> 00:07:01,292
How many rockets
you up to, Panagle?

62
00:07:01,376 --> 00:07:02,417
Sixteen and a half, sir.

63
00:07:02,501 --> 00:07:03,792
Is that enough
for the Hullabaloo?

64
00:07:03,876 --> 00:07:06,459
Izod, go fetch another pint of
gunpowder from the armory shed.

65
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:07,917
Redford! Halt!
I saw that!

66
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:11,042
- How fast were you just going?
- Safety test, sir.

67
00:07:11,126 --> 00:07:12,167
Come again?

68
00:07:12,251 --> 00:07:13,501
The vehicle
appears to be in good working order,

69
00:07:13,584 --> 00:07:14,667
I'm just checking if...

70
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:16,167
Reckless cycling.
Second warning.

71
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:18,042
Next time,
I take away the keys.

72
00:07:20,084 --> 00:07:21,751
Morning, Chef.

73
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:32,959
Clear!

74
00:07:44,917 --> 00:07:47,042
Who's missing?

75
00:07:47,126 --> 00:07:49,084
- Who's missing?
- Shakusky.

76
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:52,292
- Shakusky.
- Shakusky.

77
00:07:52,376 --> 00:07:53,959
Shakusky! Breakfast!

78
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:02,584
Shakusky, you in there?

79
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,417
Sam?

80
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:10,084
It's zipped from the inside.

81
00:08:35,876 --> 00:08:38,209
Jiminy Cricket,
he flew the coop.

82
00:08:57,751 --> 00:08:59,626
Hello, this is
Captain Sharp, over.

83
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:03,209
Captain Sharp, this is Randall
Ward over at Camp Ivanhoe. Over.

84
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,334
Morning, Randy.
What can I do for you? Over.

85
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:10,001
I'm not sure exactly.
I've got an escaped Khaki Scout. Over.

86
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:13,126
What does that mean? Over.

87
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:14,834
One of my boys
seems to have stolen

88
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:16,834
a miniature canoe and
some fishing tackle,

89
00:09:16,917 --> 00:09:19,876
10 pounds of sundries,
two bedrolls, plus an air rifle.

90
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,001
And disappeared. Over.

91
00:09:22,084 --> 00:09:23,459
Any idea why? Over.

92
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:26,709
No. He left me
a letter of resignation. Over.

93
00:09:26,792 --> 00:09:28,001
Dear Scout Master Ward,

94
00:09:28,084 --> 00:09:30,792
I am very sad to inform you
I can no longer be involved

95
00:09:30,876 --> 00:09:32,709
with the Khaki
Scouts of North America.

96
00:09:32,792 --> 00:09:35,001
The rest of the troop
will probably be glad to hear this.

97
00:09:35,084 --> 00:09:36,126
It is not your fault.

98
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:37,792
Best wishes, Sam Shakusky.

99
00:09:39,584 --> 00:09:42,959
Well, I guess we better
notify his folks. Over.

100
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:45,292
Okay. Over and out.

101
00:10:00,584 --> 00:10:01,626
Hello, Diane.

102
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:04,376
Becky, I have your
person-to-person from Chesterfield

103
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:05,626
Hold the line, please.

104
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:08,501
Hello?

105
00:10:08,584 --> 00:10:10,334
Hello, sir.
This is Captain Sharp.

106
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:13,751
Yes, sir. I received your
message. Thank you very much.

107
00:10:13,834 --> 00:10:17,292
In fact, we've come to
a decision, as a family,

108
00:10:17,376 --> 00:10:21,542
because this is only the most recent
incident involving Sam's troubles,

109
00:10:21,626 --> 00:10:24,751
and it's just not
fair to the others, so, unfortunately,

110
00:10:24,834 --> 00:10:28,209
we can't invite him
back at this time.

111
00:10:30,626 --> 00:10:34,376
There's no cause
for alarm, sir. We'll find him.

112
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:37,167
We're simply notifying you
as a matter of protocol and so on.

113
00:10:37,501 --> 00:10:40,542
I understand that.
I'm notifying you of the situation on my end.

114
00:10:41,584 --> 00:10:44,584
I'm confused by
that statement. You can't invite him back?

115
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:48,542
I'm afraid not.
He's a good boy. He's got a good heart.

116
00:10:48,626 --> 00:10:51,334
But it's just not fair
to the others, you see?

117
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:54,292
He's emotionally disturbed.

118
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:59,667
Am I speaking
with Sam's father?

119
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:03,417
No, sir.

120
00:11:03,501 --> 00:11:05,709
Sam's parents passed away
a number of years ago.

121
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:08,834
We're Mr. and
Mrs. Billingsley. We're foster parents.

122
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:12,042
Sam's been with
us since last June.

123
00:11:12,126 --> 00:11:14,959
Excuse me, sir.
This is Scout Master Ward speaking.

124
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:16,792
Are you implying
that Sam is an orphan?

125
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:19,459
Well, it's a known fact.
Of course he is.

126
00:11:19,917 --> 00:11:21,667
Well, why the hell
doesn't it say so in the register?

127
00:11:21,751 --> 00:11:22,834
Excuse my language.

128
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:25,167
I don't know.
What register?

129
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:29,876
We sent him a letter.
It should reach you presently.

130
00:11:31,292 --> 00:11:34,042
Mr. Billingsley,
I've got an escaped Khaki Scout.

131
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:36,417
We are notifying you
as a matter of protocol.

132
00:11:36,501 --> 00:11:39,709
You say you can't
invite him back? You say that he's an orphan?

133
00:11:40,376 --> 00:11:42,042
I don't understand
how that works.

134
00:11:42,792 --> 00:11:44,667
What am I supposed
to do with him?

135
00:11:45,626 --> 00:11:48,376
That's up to social services.
They'll be in touch with you.

136
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:51,251
They'll look after Sam.
Good luck to you.

137
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:00,792
You have your orders.

138
00:12:00,876 --> 00:12:02,834
Use the orienteering
and path-finding skills

139
00:12:02,917 --> 00:12:04,501
that you've been
practicing all summer.

140
00:12:04,584 --> 00:12:07,459
Let's find our man,
bring him safely back to camp.

141
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:09,751
Remember, this isn't
just a search party,

142
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:11,959
it's a chance to do
some first class Scouting.

143
00:12:12,042 --> 00:12:14,209
Any questions?

144
00:12:14,292 --> 00:12:15,417
Lazy-Eye?

145
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,084
What's your real job, sir?

146
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:18,959
- I'm a math teacher. Why?
- What grade?

147
00:12:19,042 --> 00:12:20,751
- Eighth.
- You need a PhD for that?

148
00:12:20,834 --> 00:12:22,167
Lazy-Eye, no,
but you know what,

149
00:12:22,251 --> 00:12:24,792
we're actually in the middle of something
here, in case you didn't notice.

150
00:12:24,876 --> 00:12:27,001
One of our Scouts is missing
and that's a crisis.

151
00:12:27,084 --> 00:12:28,126
Anybody else?
Redford?

152
00:12:28,251 --> 00:12:29,292
What if he resists?

153
00:12:29,376 --> 00:12:30,459
- Who?
- Shakusky.

154
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:31,584
Are we allowed to
use force on him?

155
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:35,834
No, you're not.
This is a non-violent, rescue operation.

156
00:12:35,917 --> 00:12:39,292
Your mission is to find him,
not to hurt him under any circumstances.

157
00:12:39,376 --> 00:12:41,251
Am I making
myself understood?

158
00:12:41,334 --> 00:12:43,126
- Yes.
- Good.

159
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:47,292
I'm going to change my answer,
in fact, this is my real job.

160
00:12:47,376 --> 00:12:50,959
Scout Master Troop 55.
I'm a math teacher on the side.

161
00:12:52,042 --> 00:12:53,792
Be leery out there. Okay?

162
00:12:53,876 --> 00:12:55,292
Now let's get started.
Who's got Snoopy?

163
00:12:55,376 --> 00:12:56,709
Right here.

164
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,126
Give him the scent.

165
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:04,959
I heard he ran away
because his family died.

166
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:07,334
I heard he
never had any family in the first place.

167
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:08,751
That's probably
why he's crazy.

168
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:09,959
I'll tell you one thing,

169
00:13:10,042 --> 00:13:12,792
if we find him, I'm not going to be the
one who forgot to bring a weapon.

170
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,834
Me, neither.

171
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:05,959
Camp Ivanhoe, that's all the way
across the other side of the island.

172
00:14:06,042 --> 00:14:07,292
You really think
a 12-year-old boy

173
00:14:07,376 --> 00:14:09,334
could row this far
in a miniature canoe?

174
00:14:09,417 --> 00:14:10,459
Most likely not.

175
00:14:10,542 --> 00:14:12,001
It is possible, Counselor.

176
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:14,292
I disagree, Counselor.
It would take him three days, at least.

177
00:14:14,376 --> 00:14:15,834
I don't think so.
Two days, maximum.

178
00:14:15,917 --> 00:14:18,167
- Well, I'm not going to argue about it.
- Be that as it may,

179
00:14:18,251 --> 00:14:20,209
-will you let me know if you see anything unusual?
- Yup.

180
00:15:29,251 --> 00:15:32,126
Scout Master's log,
September 2nd.

181
00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:34,626
First day of search
party for Sam Shakusky

182
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:36,292
Morale is extremely low,

183
00:15:36,376 --> 00:15:37,417
in part, I suppose,

184
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:39,792
because Sam is
the least popular Scout in the troop.

185
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:42,251
By a significant margin.

186
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:46,626
I'm confused
and I'm worried.

187
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:50,626
Please let us
find him tomorrow.

188
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:54,042
Please don't let
him fall off a cliff,

189
00:15:54,126 --> 00:15:56,334
or drown in the goddamn
lake or something.

190
00:15:56,417 --> 00:15:58,001
A terrible day
at Camp Ivanhoe.

191
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:02,876
Let's hope
tomorrow's better.

192
00:17:29,876 --> 00:17:32,126
One Year earlier

193
00:19:01,251 --> 00:19:02,459
What kind of bird are you?

194
00:19:03,459 --> 00:19:05,709
I'm a sparrow,
she's a dove...

195
00:19:05,792 --> 00:19:09,959
No. I said,
what kind of bird are you?

196
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:14,417
I'm a raven.

197
00:19:15,792 --> 00:19:16,959
Boys aren't
allowed in here.

198
00:19:18,542 --> 00:19:19,709
I'll be leaving soon.

199
00:19:22,792 --> 00:19:24,042
What happened to your hand?

200
00:19:26,126 --> 00:19:27,834
I got hit in the mirror.

201
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,667
Really, how did that happen?

202
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:32,876
I lost my temper at myself.

203
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:37,459
What's your name?

204
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:38,792
Sam. What's yours?

205
00:19:39,251 --> 00:19:40,626
I'm Suzy.

206
00:19:43,292 --> 00:19:44,709
It's not polite to stare.

207
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:47,417
Birds, ready?
Who are you?

208
00:19:47,501 --> 00:19:49,042
Where did you come from?
Go back to your seat.

209
00:19:55,209 --> 00:19:56,917
He likes you.

210
00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:31,542
Were you followed?

211
00:20:34,042 --> 00:20:35,542
- I doubt it.
- Good.

212
00:20:38,084 --> 00:20:39,334
Is that a cat in there?

213
00:20:47,626 --> 00:20:49,834
- Can you read a map?
- Uh-huh.

214
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:52,417
I do cartography.

215
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,626
I feel we should
go halfway today, and halfway tomorrow

216
00:20:54,709 --> 00:20:56,126
since you're a less
experienced hiker,

217
00:20:56,209 --> 00:20:58,251
and you're wearing
Sunday school shoes.

218
00:20:58,334 --> 00:20:59,376
They're not really
Sunday school shoes.

219
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:00,501
Here.

220
00:21:00,584 --> 00:21:01,626
Oh, thank you.

221
00:21:04,209 --> 00:21:05,667
Here's where
we are right now.

222
00:21:05,751 --> 00:21:07,876
I'd like to pitch
camp here by 1600,

223
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:09,792
which means 4:00.
How does that sound?

224
00:21:09,876 --> 00:21:11,792
- Fine.
- You want some beef jerky?

225
00:21:11,876 --> 00:21:13,292
- Okay.
- Let's go.

226
00:21:26,126 --> 00:21:27,501
Are you thirsty?

227
00:21:27,584 --> 00:21:28,959
No, thank you.

228
00:21:29,042 --> 00:21:31,126
Well, if your throat
gets parched,

229
00:21:31,209 --> 00:21:33,001
stick a pebble in your
mouth and suck on it.

230
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:34,959
You can quench your thirst
with the spit, supposedly.

231
00:21:35,501 --> 00:21:36,542
Mmm-hmm.

232
00:21:37,209 --> 00:21:40,417
Sometimes I stick leaves on my
hair. It helps cool your head down.

233
00:21:40,501 --> 00:21:41,542
Hmm. That's a good idea.

234
00:21:41,626 --> 00:21:43,959
It might also help if
you didn't wear a fur hat.

235
00:21:44,042 --> 00:21:46,001
Yeah. True.

236
00:21:47,292 --> 00:21:50,584
You can go ahead.
Be careful.

237
00:22:01,709 --> 00:22:03,459
Here's a trick,
throw pine needles in the air

238
00:22:03,542 --> 00:22:05,459
and you can see
which direction the wind is blowing.

239
00:22:09,751 --> 00:22:11,084
Which Way?

240
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:15,001
I guess it
doesn't really matter,

241
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,376
just as long as we
cover our tracks.

242
00:22:27,876 --> 00:22:29,876
You smell like perfume.

243
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:31,376
Oh, it's my mother's.

244
00:22:32,042 --> 00:22:33,792
Hmm. Hmm.

245
00:22:44,292 --> 00:22:46,167
I brought water, too.

246
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,167
- You wait here.
- Okay.

247
00:22:52,417 --> 00:22:53,792
Be right back.

248
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,167
Watch your head!

249
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:09,626
Where the hell is it?

250
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:18,001
Found it!

251
00:23:28,792 --> 00:23:29,917
It's ready.

252
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:33,376
He knows someone's
watching him.

253
00:23:33,459 --> 00:23:37,042
I agree. Wait.
Why do you say that?

254
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,251
Mmm... I don't know,
I just think he can feel us.

255
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:48,209
Follow me.

256
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:17,292
How strong of
a swimmer are you?

257
00:24:17,376 --> 00:24:20,126
Pretty good.
I broke our school record for the backstroke.

258
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:23,792
Okay. Well, I'm not that strong of a
swimmer, so I wear a life preserver.

259
00:24:29,709 --> 00:24:30,834
Watch out for turtles.

260
00:24:30,917 --> 00:24:33,417
They'll bite you
if you put your fingers down their mouths.

261
00:24:33,501 --> 00:24:35,084
Okay.

262
00:24:35,167 --> 00:24:36,876
Let me see if I
can catch this one.

263
00:24:39,709 --> 00:24:41,209
Feel something.

264
00:24:46,001 --> 00:24:47,126
Hmm...

265
00:24:47,209 --> 00:24:48,501
Somebody wrote on him.

266
00:24:49,626 --> 00:24:51,542
The stick's moving.

267
00:24:51,626 --> 00:24:52,792
You got one!

268
00:24:54,042 --> 00:24:56,792
Fish on hook!
Reel him in, slowly.

269
00:25:06,584 --> 00:25:07,667
Mmm.

270
00:25:10,501 --> 00:25:13,501
Very good.
You know a lot about camping, don't you?

271
00:25:14,334 --> 00:25:18,459
I'm a Khaki Scout. It's what I'm trained
for. Well, anyway, I used to be.

272
00:25:19,501 --> 00:25:22,959
Maybe we can feed your cat
the guts and eyeballs.

273
00:25:23,042 --> 00:25:24,709
Oh, that's okay.
He only eats kitten food.

274
00:25:26,084 --> 00:25:27,126
Oh.

275
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:30,542
What else did you bring?
Maybe we can make an inventory.

276
00:25:31,376 --> 00:25:32,501
Okay.

277
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,084
Go ahead.

278
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:47,126
This is my record player.
It works with batteries.

279
00:25:47,209 --> 00:25:49,584
Well, actually,
it belongs to my little brother, Lionel.

280
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:51,126
- I left him a note.
- Okay.

281
00:25:51,209 --> 00:25:53,084
- Do you like music?
- Yeah.

282
00:25:54,167 --> 00:25:56,167
This is my
favorite record album.

283
00:25:56,251 --> 00:25:58,251
My godmother gave it
to me for my birthday.

284
00:25:58,334 --> 00:26:00,084
She lives in France.

285
00:26:02,126 --> 00:26:05,501
These are my books.
I like stories with magic powers in them.

286
00:26:05,584 --> 00:26:08,042
Either in kingdoms on Earth
or on foreign planets.

287
00:26:08,126 --> 00:26:11,251
Usually, I prefer
a girl hero, but not always.

288
00:26:11,334 --> 00:26:13,459
I couldn't bring them all
because it got too heavy.

289
00:26:13,542 --> 00:26:14,667
You can borrow any you want.

290
00:26:14,751 --> 00:26:15,792
Thank you.

291
00:26:15,876 --> 00:26:20,751
I also brought
my lefty scissors because I'm left-handed,

292
00:26:20,834 --> 00:26:25,376
some rubber bands,
extra batteries, my toothbrush,

293
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:26,542
and my binoculars,
as you know.

294
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:27,667
Yeah.

295
00:26:27,751 --> 00:26:29,959
I forgot my comb.
But I'll use my fingers.

296
00:26:35,292 --> 00:26:36,376
Huh.

297
00:26:38,792 --> 00:26:42,667
Wait, these are all
library books.

298
00:26:42,751 --> 00:26:46,667
In my school, you're only
allowed to check out one at a time.

299
00:26:47,084 --> 00:26:49,959
Some of these are
going to be overdue.

300
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:53,084
Do you steal?

301
00:26:55,667 --> 00:26:57,376
Why? You're not poor.

302
00:26:58,542 --> 00:27:02,251
I might turn some of
them back in one day. I haven't decided yet.

303
00:27:02,334 --> 00:27:05,917
I know it's bad. I think I just took
them to have a secret to keep.

304
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:07,667
Anyway,
for some reason,

305
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,417
it makes me feel in
a better mood sometimes.

306
00:27:10,917 --> 00:27:12,626
Are you depressed?

307
00:27:14,376 --> 00:27:15,626
How come?

308
00:27:15,709 --> 00:27:18,001
Well, I can show you
an example, if you'd like,

309
00:27:19,501 --> 00:27:21,751
but it doesn't make
me feel very good.

310
00:27:21,834 --> 00:27:26,167
Anyway, I found this
on top of our refrigerator.

311
00:27:27,542 --> 00:27:28,584
Does that mean you?

312
00:27:29,751 --> 00:27:31,126
I think so.

313
00:27:35,667 --> 00:27:36,709
Are you laughing?

314
00:27:40,084 --> 00:27:41,126
It's not funny.

315
00:27:44,876 --> 00:27:47,417
You really know
how to make friends.

316
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:07,626
I'm sorry.

317
00:28:08,917 --> 00:28:10,792
Oh. It's okay.

318
00:28:11,126 --> 00:28:12,792
I'm on your side.

319
00:28:14,251 --> 00:28:15,584
I know.

320
00:28:20,667 --> 00:28:22,042
Thank you.

321
00:28:26,167 --> 00:28:28,584
Which one's the best?

322
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:32,834
"His eyes downcast, his kingdom in
ruins, Mynar pressed his heavy paw

323
00:28:32,917 --> 00:28:34,876
"through the rippling surface
of the cool shallows

324
00:28:34,959 --> 00:28:36,584
"and down to its stone floor.

325
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:39,751
"My people once were led
by a great and noble beast

326
00:28:39,834 --> 00:28:43,042
"and I no longer
see his face in this reflection.'

327
00:28:57,751 --> 00:29:01,001
"Meanwhile,
on the Plains of Tabitha, Francine rested.

328
00:29:01,084 --> 00:29:03,042
"There would be
another time for war."

329
00:29:05,834 --> 00:29:08,542
Suzy! Dinner! I'm not
going to say it again.

330
00:29:10,876 --> 00:29:12,334
Where's your sister?

331
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:16,751
I don't know, but she borrowed
my record player for 10 days without asking.

332
00:29:16,834 --> 00:29:19,501
What does that mean?

333
00:29:19,584 --> 00:29:22,001
Dear Lionel, I need
to use your record player.

334
00:29:22,084 --> 00:29:25,626
I will give it back
in 10 days or less. Do not tell Mom. Or Dad.

335
00:29:25,709 --> 00:29:28,917
I will replace the batteries when I
return. Signed, Suzy Bishop.

336
00:29:31,876 --> 00:29:33,459
Walt! Where the hell are you?

337
00:29:33,542 --> 00:29:34,667
Right here!

338
00:29:34,751 --> 00:29:36,667
Why are you cursing at me?

339
00:29:36,751 --> 00:29:39,417
Does it concern you that
your daughter's just run away from home?

340
00:29:42,584 --> 00:29:43,876
That's a loaded question.

341
00:29:44,376 --> 00:29:45,709
Come down and read this.

342
00:29:46,376 --> 00:29:49,001
Scout Master Ward
confirms they've had no luck.

343
00:29:49,084 --> 00:29:50,126
They're going home for...

344
00:29:53,251 --> 00:29:54,292
Who's there?

345
00:29:59,334 --> 00:30:02,084
Good evening.
Sorry to startle you.

346
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:04,709
What are you doing here?
Nobody called the police.

347
00:30:04,792 --> 00:30:07,084
I know. Uh...
I know.

348
00:30:07,167 --> 00:30:09,584
The search party's
not over yet. In other words...

349
00:30:09,667 --> 00:30:11,834
Suzy's missing, too!
Go find her.

350
00:30:14,834 --> 00:30:17,084
The tropical cyclone,
which originated last week

351
00:30:17,167 --> 00:30:20,001
off the coast of
British Honduras, has intensified rapidly

352
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:22,667
and is now designated
Hurricane Mabeline.

353
00:30:22,751 --> 00:30:24,459
Stay tuned for
further information

354
00:30:29,834 --> 00:30:34,376
How can we help her?
She's got so many problems.

355
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:36,876
It's getting worse.

356
00:30:38,542 --> 00:30:40,167
Whose fault is it?

357
00:30:40,251 --> 00:30:41,376
I don't know.

358
00:30:42,126 --> 00:30:44,876
But just for the record
95% of all runaways

359
00:30:44,959 --> 00:30:46,834
return home within
the first six hours.

360
00:30:47,417 --> 00:30:50,417
That doesn't do you
any good right now. It's just a statistic.

361
00:30:50,834 --> 00:30:53,292
But in all likelihood,
Suzy's probably hiding in the closet

362
00:30:53,376 --> 00:30:55,667
at her best friend's house
playing Chinese checkers

363
00:30:55,751 --> 00:30:58,084
at this very moment,
as we speak.

364
00:30:58,167 --> 00:31:00,376
She doesn't have any friends.

365
00:31:01,876 --> 00:31:03,251
How's Laura?

366
00:31:06,459 --> 00:31:07,834
"How's Laura?"

367
00:31:07,917 --> 00:31:09,459
Mrs. Bishop, I mean.

368
00:31:09,542 --> 00:31:12,126
I don't understand.

369
00:31:12,209 --> 00:31:13,584
Is she upset?

370
00:31:28,001 --> 00:31:29,376
There's a porcupine.

371
00:31:38,876 --> 00:31:43,459
She has a pen pal!
It's very intimate. They planned this together.

372
00:31:44,501 --> 00:31:47,751
Sam Shakusky.
That's my escaped Khaki Scout.

373
00:31:47,834 --> 00:31:48,917
His family died.

374
00:31:49,001 --> 00:31:51,001
Holy Christ,
what am I looking at?

375
00:31:51,084 --> 00:31:54,417
He does watercolors.
Mostly landscapes, but a few nudes.

376
00:31:54,501 --> 00:31:55,542
She sit for this?

377
00:31:55,626 --> 00:31:56,667
What's he say?

378
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:01,459
Dear Suzy,
you have a superb voice.

379
00:32:01,542 --> 00:32:03,834
You were my favorite animal
in the program, by far.

380
00:32:03,917 --> 00:32:05,251
Please find enclosed...

381
00:32:05,334 --> 00:32:07,001
Dear Sam,
thank you very much.

382
00:32:07,084 --> 00:32:09,834
I got replaced as the raven
because I yelled at Mrs. Lynn.

383
00:32:09,917 --> 00:32:11,667
After that,
I was only a blue jay, but...

384
00:32:11,751 --> 00:32:14,584
Dear Suzy, I'm sorry
that your brothers are so selfish.

385
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:16,042
Maybe they will
grow out of it.

386
00:32:16,126 --> 00:32:18,626
Sometimes people do things
without knowing the reasons for...

387
00:32:18,709 --> 00:32:20,459
Dear Sam, you are
an excellent painter,

388
00:32:20,542 --> 00:32:22,251
especially trees
and telephone poles.

389
00:32:22,334 --> 00:32:25,417
Is the girl in the water supposed to be
me? My favorite color is...

390
00:32:25,501 --> 00:32:29,209
Dear Suzy, I accidentally built a
fire while I was sleepwalking.

391
00:32:29,292 --> 00:32:32,417
I have no memory of this,
but my foster parents think I am lying.

392
00:32:32,501 --> 00:32:33,542
Unfortunately, it is...

393
00:32:33,626 --> 00:32:35,626
Dear Sam,
I am in trouble again

394
00:32:35,709 --> 00:32:37,209
because I threw a rock
through the window.

395
00:32:37,292 --> 00:32:39,709
My mother still has
glass in her hair. Also...

396
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:42,292
Dear Suzy, I have been
trying very hard to make friends,

397
00:32:42,376 --> 00:32:44,834
but I feel people do
not like my personality.

398
00:32:44,917 --> 00:32:46,751
In fact, I can understand
why they might not...

399
00:32:46,834 --> 00:32:48,751
Dear Sam,
now I am getting suspended

400
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:50,334
because I got in
a fight with Molly.

401
00:32:50,417 --> 00:32:53,417
She says I go berserk.
Our principal is against me. Why do some...

402
00:32:53,501 --> 00:32:55,834
Dear Suzy, I know your parents
hurt' your feelings,

403
00:32:55,917 --> 00:32:58,917
but they still love you.
That is more important. If they...

404
00:32:59,001 --> 00:33:00,667
Dear Sam,
I do think you should

405
00:33:00,751 --> 00:33:01,917
think of their
faces every day,

406
00:33:02,001 --> 00:33:03,459
even if it makes you sad.

407
00:33:03,542 --> 00:33:05,001
It is too bad they
did not leave you

408
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:07,001
more pictures of themselves.
Can you...

409
00:33:07,084 --> 00:33:09,001
Dear Suzy, here is my plan.

410
00:33:09,084 --> 00:33:11,084
Dear Sam, my answer is yes.

411
00:33:11,167 --> 00:33:12,584
Dear Suzy, when?

412
00:33:12,667 --> 00:33:14,251
Dear Sam, where?

413
00:33:14,334 --> 00:33:17,834
Dear Suzy,
walk 400 yards due north from your house

414
00:33:17,917 --> 00:33:20,459
to the dirt path
which has not got any name on it.

415
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:24,417
Turn right and follow to the
end. I will meet you in the meadow.

416
00:33:32,209 --> 00:33:34,501
Gee whiz, what do you
suppose happened to him?

417
00:33:34,584 --> 00:33:38,001
I'm not sure.
I think he went searching in the dark.

418
00:33:38,084 --> 00:33:41,042
She stole the batteries
out of my flashlight.

419
00:33:41,126 --> 00:33:43,667
Stole the batteries
out of the flashlight...

420
00:33:45,834 --> 00:33:47,084
I think he's onto us.

421
00:33:47,167 --> 00:33:48,376
Of course he is.

422
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:48,959
Of course he is?

423
00:33:49,709 --> 00:33:50,792
Of course he is.

424
00:33:52,584 --> 00:33:54,834
Then why aren't we
worried about that?

425
00:33:54,917 --> 00:33:56,542
I am.

426
00:33:56,626 --> 00:33:58,251
Well, I didn't know.

427
00:33:58,334 --> 00:34:01,709
Or, anyway,
I thought maybe I was wrong.

428
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:02,834
Did you hit him?

429
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:04,042
No. He fell in a ditch.

430
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:08,751
Hey! Cat food!
I think it's a clue.

431
00:34:13,209 --> 00:34:14,584
That's her.

432
00:34:16,251 --> 00:34:17,917
Where's he going?

433
00:34:18,709 --> 00:34:20,167
I don't know.

434
00:34:21,709 --> 00:34:23,376
All right,
we know they're together.

435
00:34:23,459 --> 00:34:25,667
We know they're within
a certain radius of this spot.

436
00:34:25,751 --> 00:34:28,001
I'm declaring a case
with the county right now.

437
00:34:28,084 --> 00:34:31,584
Until help arrives,
I'm deputizing the little guy, the skinny one,

438
00:34:31,667 --> 00:34:33,084
and the boy with
the patch on his eye

439
00:34:33,167 --> 00:34:34,501
to come with me in
the station wagon.

440
00:34:34,584 --> 00:34:37,667
Randy, you drop in and head up
river with the rest of your troops,

441
00:34:37,751 --> 00:34:39,001
split up on foot.

442
00:34:39,084 --> 00:34:41,167
Becky, call Jed,
tell him to circle over

443
00:34:41,251 --> 00:34:43,709
this end of the island
and fly low.

444
00:34:56,167 --> 00:34:57,251
Is it them?

445
00:34:57,334 --> 00:34:58,376
Yeah, yeah.

446
00:34:59,542 --> 00:35:00,834
They found the campfire.

447
00:35:00,917 --> 00:35:05,751
Rats! I should have put
more pine needles on it. Let's go.

448
00:35:12,084 --> 00:35:13,334
Be careful.

449
00:35:44,459 --> 00:35:46,084
What do you creeps want?

450
00:35:46,876 --> 00:35:48,292
We're looking for you.

451
00:35:49,251 --> 00:35:50,376
Why?

452
00:35:50,959 --> 00:35:52,334
Well, because
you're a fugitive.

453
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:54,667
No, I'm not.
I quit the Khaki Scouts.

454
00:35:54,751 --> 00:35:57,167
Well, it doesn't matter
anyway. You don't have that authority.

455
00:35:57,251 --> 00:35:58,542
We've been deputized.

456
00:35:58,626 --> 00:36:01,876
Now, you're going to come
along peacefully or not?

457
00:36:05,042 --> 00:36:06,334
Listen to some reason.

458
00:36:06,417 --> 00:36:08,501
I don't like you.
You don't like me.

459
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:11,292
So, why don't you
just let us disappear?

460
00:36:12,251 --> 00:36:15,167
Well, it's tempting,
but we can't allow it.

461
00:36:16,292 --> 00:36:17,584
You know,
you shouldn't be friends with him.

462
00:36:18,417 --> 00:36:19,459
Why not?

463
00:36:20,167 --> 00:36:21,334
Because he's crazy.

464
00:36:22,584 --> 00:36:24,251
Maybe you just
don't know him.

465
00:36:25,626 --> 00:36:27,501
Actually, we know him
a lot better than you.

466
00:36:27,584 --> 00:36:29,501
He's emotionally disturbed
because his family died.

467
00:36:29,584 --> 00:36:31,292
Nickleby, tie him up.

468
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:40,209
Do not cross this stick.

469
00:36:48,042 --> 00:36:49,542
You're doomed, Shakusky.

470
00:37:26,334 --> 00:37:28,667
Molly's right,
I do go berserk.

471
00:37:31,001 --> 00:37:32,626
It was him or us.

472
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:38,334
Oh, no.

473
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:45,334
She stabbed
Redford in the back with lefty scissors.

474
00:37:45,417 --> 00:37:47,084
Repeat that, please? Over.

475
00:37:47,167 --> 00:37:50,334
Puncture wound, lower lumbar.
Make room for a stretcher in the cockpit.

476
00:37:50,751 --> 00:37:51,959
You're going to be okay.

477
00:37:52,042 --> 00:37:55,001
Thank goodness she
missed the artery. Here, bite on this.

478
00:37:55,084 --> 00:37:56,917
I tried to chop him,
but he dodged my tomahawk.

479
00:37:57,001 --> 00:37:58,501
He's got
excellent marksmanship.

480
00:37:58,584 --> 00:37:59,792
Shot Deluca in both arms.

481
00:37:59,876 --> 00:38:02,167
I guess we're going to miss
the Hullabaloo after all.

482
00:38:02,251 --> 00:38:03,584
Where's Snoopy?

483
00:38:04,876 --> 00:38:06,876
Those sons of bitches.

484
00:38:06,959 --> 00:38:09,542
They got him right
through the neck.

485
00:38:11,542 --> 00:38:13,209
Was he a good dog?

486
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:18,917
Who's to say.
But he didn't deserve to die.

487
00:38:35,042 --> 00:38:36,167
What happened?
Who is that?

488
00:38:36,251 --> 00:38:37,334
Clear the dock, Edgar!

489
00:38:37,417 --> 00:38:39,001
- Why is he bleeding?
-Is Suzy with you?

490
00:38:39,084 --> 00:38:40,792
No, she's in
the woods with Shakusky.

491
00:38:40,876 --> 00:38:41,917
Where am I going?

492
00:38:42,001 --> 00:38:44,917
The infirmary at Fort Lebanon.
We'll be right behind you. You got it?

493
00:38:45,001 --> 00:38:46,126
Yup.

494
00:38:46,209 --> 00:38:47,501
Warm up the motor,
I'll be right back.

495
00:38:47,584 --> 00:38:48,876
Hold it right there!

496
00:38:49,876 --> 00:38:51,042
You're not
leaving this island.

497
00:38:51,126 --> 00:38:54,001
Our daughter has been
abducted by one of these beige lunatics.

498
00:38:54,084 --> 00:38:56,459
Walt, it's very clear.

499
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,501
The two of them
conspired in this together.

500
00:38:58,584 --> 00:38:59,917
Don't worry,
Mr. Bishop. She'll be safe.

501
00:39:00,001 --> 00:39:01,292
Sam's got excellent
wilderness skills.

502
00:39:02,417 --> 00:39:04,417
Why can't you
control your Scouts?

503
00:39:06,292 --> 00:39:07,542
Well, I'm trying.

504
00:39:10,542 --> 00:39:11,667
Whoa, whoa. Hey.

505
00:39:11,751 --> 00:39:12,834
Stop it! Stop it!

506
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:14,501
- Stop it!
- Stop it.

507
00:39:14,584 --> 00:39:19,251
I do blame him.
But I also blame myself and both of you.

508
00:39:19,334 --> 00:39:23,834
With all due respect,
you can't let your children stab people.

509
00:39:23,917 --> 00:39:25,459
What are you talking about?

510
00:39:25,542 --> 00:39:27,167
She's violent,
Mrs. Bishop, it's assault.

511
00:39:30,834 --> 00:39:32,376
- Are you a lawyer?
- No, I'm not a lawyer.

512
00:39:32,459 --> 00:39:33,584
Well, we are!

513
00:39:33,667 --> 00:39:34,751
Take your hands
off my wife!

514
00:39:34,834 --> 00:39:35,584
Take them off!

515
00:39:36,626 --> 00:39:40,417
Excuse me.
Excuse me, Captain Sharp!

516
00:39:44,501 --> 00:39:46,376
As some of you know,
I taught Sam

517
00:39:46,459 --> 00:39:48,751
for the cartography
accomplishment button.

518
00:39:48,834 --> 00:39:51,167
He's a smart boy
and he expressed a keen interest

519
00:39:51,251 --> 00:39:53,792
in the history of the island's
indigenous peoples.

520
00:39:54,334 --> 00:39:57,334
In particular,
I recall his fascination with the idea

521
00:39:57,417 --> 00:40:01,709
of retracing the original
path of the old Chickchaw harvest migration.

522
00:40:05,917 --> 00:40:09,917
What I'm getting at is this.
I think I know where they're going.

523
00:40:16,251 --> 00:40:17,876
Onto the birdhouse,

524
00:40:17,959 --> 00:40:20,042
where every kind
of bird imaginable

525
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,209
is whirling
and wheeling around.

526
00:40:28,209 --> 00:40:30,709
This is our land!

527
00:40:30,792 --> 00:40:32,417
Yes, it is!

528
00:40:33,542 --> 00:40:34,626
Whoo!

529
00:40:35,417 --> 00:40:36,709
Whoo!

530
00:40:36,792 --> 00:40:37,834
Run!

531
00:40:55,709 --> 00:40:56,792
Let's jump!

532
00:41:20,792 --> 00:41:21,876
On three!

533
00:41:21,959 --> 00:41:23,001
One, two, three!

534
00:41:35,251 --> 00:41:38,542
Any of you who have ever
had to sweat through piano exercises

535
00:41:38,626 --> 00:41:40,792
will sympathize with these...

536
00:41:50,126 --> 00:41:52,001
I like it here,
but I don't like the name.

537
00:41:53,292 --> 00:41:54,501
Me, neither.

538
00:41:54,584 --> 00:41:58,417
"Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet"
It's got no ring to it.

539
00:41:59,126 --> 00:42:01,417
Let's change it.
What should it be?

540
00:42:02,459 --> 00:42:03,376
Let me think
for a minute.

541
00:42:14,584 --> 00:42:16,542
I made you some jewelry.

542
00:42:21,042 --> 00:42:22,626
Are your ears pierced?

543
00:42:32,709 --> 00:42:33,917
It's pretty.

544
00:42:35,626 --> 00:42:37,209
Do the other one.

545
00:42:45,334 --> 00:42:47,751
Why do you
always use binoculars?

546
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:54,084
It helps me see things
closer, even if they're not very far away.

547
00:42:54,834 --> 00:42:57,001
I pretend it's
my magic power.

548
00:42:57,334 --> 00:42:58,376
Hmm.

549
00:42:58,459 --> 00:43:00,376
That sounds like poetry.

550
00:43:00,459 --> 00:43:02,417
Poems don't always
have to rhyme, you know.

551
00:43:02,501 --> 00:43:05,126
They're just
supposed to be creative.

552
00:43:08,292 --> 00:43:11,959
So, what do you want to be
when you grow up?

553
00:43:12,376 --> 00:43:15,917
I don't know.
I want to go on adventures, I think.

554
00:43:16,001 --> 00:43:18,834
Not get stuck in one place.
How about you?

555
00:43:21,126 --> 00:43:24,584
Go on adventures, too.
Not get stuck, too.

556
00:43:24,667 --> 00:43:27,459
Anyway, we can't
predict the exact future.

557
00:43:28,376 --> 00:43:29,417
That's true.

558
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:35,001
It's possible I may
wet the bed, by the way. Later, I mean.

559
00:43:36,292 --> 00:43:37,334
Okay.

560
00:43:38,042 --> 00:43:40,167
I wish I didn't
have to mention it, but just in case.

561
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:41,751
I don't want to
make you be offended.

562
00:43:43,292 --> 00:43:44,876
Of course I won't.

563
00:43:46,459 --> 00:43:48,167
What's that one for?

564
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:49,626
- This?
- Yeah.

565
00:43:51,126 --> 00:43:52,501
It's not
an accomplishment button.

566
00:43:52,584 --> 00:43:54,459
I inherited it
from my mother.

567
00:43:55,084 --> 00:43:58,334
It's not actually meant for a male to
wear, but I don't give a damn.

568
00:44:00,626 --> 00:44:02,501
Are your foster parents
still mad at you,

569
00:44:02,584 --> 00:44:04,459
for getting in
trouble so much?

570
00:44:04,834 --> 00:44:06,876
I don't think so.

571
00:44:06,959 --> 00:44:08,959
We're starting to get to
know each other better.

572
00:44:09,042 --> 00:44:11,042
I feel I'm in
a real family now.

573
00:44:11,126 --> 00:44:13,042
Not like yours,
but similar to one.

574
00:44:14,334 --> 00:44:16,667
I always wished
I was an orphan.

575
00:44:16,751 --> 00:44:18,917
Most of my
favorite characters are.

576
00:44:19,001 --> 00:44:20,959
I think your lives
are more special.

577
00:44:24,542 --> 00:44:26,959
I love you, but you don't know
what you're talking about.

578
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:31,084
I love you, too.

579
00:45:32,959 --> 00:45:35,001
- I've got sand in my mouth.
- Oh.

580
00:45:36,584 --> 00:45:38,209
Uh... Can you French kiss?

581
00:45:38,917 --> 00:45:41,376
I think so.
Is there any secret to it?

582
00:45:41,459 --> 00:45:43,542
The tongues touch each other.

583
00:45:43,626 --> 00:45:45,334
Okay, let's try it.

584
00:45:57,876 --> 00:45:59,251
It feels hard.

585
00:46:00,126 --> 00:46:01,167
Do you mind?

586
00:46:01,251 --> 00:46:02,292
I like it.

587
00:46:05,126 --> 00:46:06,417
Tilt your head sideways.

588
00:46:14,584 --> 00:46:16,292
You can touch my chest.

589
00:46:18,626 --> 00:46:21,209
I... I think they're
going to grow more.

590
00:46:30,167 --> 00:46:32,376
"The flashlight's
beam drew a moon through the black

00:46:32,459 --> 00:46:35,084
"across the attic
and settled on a gap in the baseboard.

592
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:37,792

00:46:43,334 --> 00:46:45,667
"'Like someone in there's

"'Little brothers

600
00:46:57,626 --> 00:46:59,126
I'm listening. Read on.

601
00:47:01,292 --> 00:47:02,584
Part two.

602
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:34,459
No!

603
00:48:14,917 --> 00:48:17,084
Dear Sam, it saddens
me to write this letter,

604
00:48:17,167 --> 00:48:19,167
but Mrs. Billingsley
and I have decided

605
00:48:19,251 --> 00:48:21,251
we cannot permit you
to return to our home.

606
00:48:21,334 --> 00:48:25,042
I know you mean well.
Do trust me, this is for the best.

607
00:48:25,126 --> 00:48:27,376
Godspeed,
Herbert Billingsley.

608
00:48:39,126 --> 00:48:43,626
Be advised, the two of you will
never see each other again.

609
00:48:43,709 --> 00:48:47,584
Those were your last words.
Do you understand?

610
00:48:48,084 --> 00:48:49,626
I'd be careful
if I were you.

611
00:48:49,709 --> 00:48:52,042
One of these days,
somebody's going to get pushed too far,

612
00:48:52,126 --> 00:48:53,876
and who knows what
they're capable of.

613
00:48:54,459 --> 00:48:55,792
Is that a threat?

614
00:48:56,292 --> 00:48:57,334
It's a warning.

615
00:48:57,417 --> 00:48:59,334
You're a traitor
to our family.

616
00:48:59,417 --> 00:49:01,126
Good. I want to be.

617
00:49:18,709 --> 00:49:23,376
I'm sorry about this.
I didn't know your situation.

618
00:49:23,459 --> 00:49:25,501
It wasn't in the register.

619
00:49:26,584 --> 00:49:28,751
How'd you lose your parents?

620
00:49:29,959 --> 00:49:32,876
Never mind, I don't
need to ask about that.

621
00:49:36,542 --> 00:49:41,459
I wish we had time
to do an inspection back there. On the beach.

622
00:49:42,501 --> 00:49:45,667
I would have given
you a commendable.

623
00:49:45,751 --> 00:49:47,876
That was one of the
best pitched campsites I've ever seen.

624
00:49:47,959 --> 00:49:49,084
Honestly.

625
00:49:49,167 --> 00:49:50,501
Thank you.

626
00:49:53,667 --> 00:49:56,126
You don't want to be
a Khaki Scout anymore?

627
00:50:08,959 --> 00:50:10,001
Hello, Becky?

628
00:50:10,084 --> 00:50:13,334
Judy, I have your
person-to-person from New Penzance.

629
00:50:13,417 --> 00:50:14,459
Go ahead, New Penzance.

630
00:50:15,084 --> 00:50:16,584
Hello, this is
Captain Sharp.

631
00:50:16,667 --> 00:50:19,042
Hello, Captain Sharp.
This is Social Services.

632
00:50:19,126 --> 00:50:21,709
I'm calling in
reference to Sam Shakusky, ward of the state.

633
00:50:21,792 --> 00:50:22,959
I understand he's
in your custody.

634
00:50:23,042 --> 00:50:24,167
That's correct.

635
00:50:24,251 --> 00:50:26,084
What's his condition?
Has he suffered

636
00:50:26,167 --> 00:50:28,417
any injury or
trauma of any kind?

637
00:50:28,501 --> 00:50:30,251
- He's fine.
- Very good.

638
00:50:30,334 --> 00:50:31,667
How do I get to you?

639
00:50:31,751 --> 00:50:33,292
The fastest way
would be sea plane.

640
00:50:33,417 --> 00:50:34,959
Jed can bring you
in with the mail.

641
00:50:35,042 --> 00:50:36,959
I'll come tomorrow morning,
if that's acceptable to you.

642
00:50:37,042 --> 00:50:38,834
Is someone able to
provide reasonable care

643
00:50:38,917 --> 00:50:40,542
and nourishment for
the boy until that time?

644
00:50:41,167 --> 00:50:42,251
Uh-huh.

645
00:50:42,751 --> 00:50:43,792
Is that a yes?

646
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:45,251
Uh-huh.

647
00:50:47,001 --> 00:50:49,834
Very good, I'll contact you
again before the end of the day.

648
00:50:49,917 --> 00:50:51,001
Wait a second.

649
00:50:51,084 --> 00:50:52,292
Yes?

650
00:50:52,376 --> 00:50:53,542
Social Services?

651
00:50:53,626 --> 00:50:54,834
Captain Sharp?

652
00:50:55,959 --> 00:50:57,792
What's going to
happen to him?

653
00:51:00,251 --> 00:51:03,584
Well, normally,
we try to place him in another foster home,

654
00:51:03,667 --> 00:51:05,792
but that option's no
longer available to us,

655
00:51:05,876 --> 00:51:08,084
in my opinion,
due to his case history.

656
00:51:08,167 --> 00:51:10,417
Which means he'll go
to Juvenile Refuge.

657
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:13,334
Wait. What does that mean?
Is that an orphanage?

658
00:51:14,001 --> 00:51:15,042
Who's speaking?

659
00:51:15,459 --> 00:51:17,209
This is Scout Master
Randy Ward.

660
00:51:19,667 --> 00:51:21,251
Right, an orphanage.

661
00:51:25,292 --> 00:51:28,167
But the first step is
the admissions panel

662
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,917
requires
a psychological evaluation

663
00:51:30,001 --> 00:51:32,417
to determine
whether or not the boy

664
00:51:32,501 --> 00:51:34,459
is a candidate for
institutional treatment

665
00:51:34,542 --> 00:51:37,084
or electroshock therapy.

666
00:51:37,167 --> 00:51:39,167
Excuse me.
Shock therapy?

667
00:51:39,251 --> 00:51:41,417
Why would that
be called for? He's not violent.

668
00:51:41,917 --> 00:51:44,417
The report describes
an assault with scissors.

669
00:51:44,501 --> 00:51:45,667
That was the girl.

670
00:51:45,751 --> 00:51:46,917
That was the girl
that did that.

671
00:51:47,459 --> 00:51:52,501
Well, maybe she needs help,
too, but that's not our job. Okay?

672
00:51:56,292 --> 00:51:57,334
Okay.

673
00:52:33,792 --> 00:52:35,376
I'll be out back.

674
00:52:36,751 --> 00:52:39,417
I'm going to find
a tree to chop down.

675
00:52:44,334 --> 00:52:47,459
I do know what
you're feeling, Suzy-bean.

676
00:52:47,542 --> 00:52:51,501
I've had moments
myself where I say, "What am I doing here?

677
00:52:51,584 --> 00:52:53,042
"Who made this decision?

678
00:52:53,876 --> 00:52:57,042
"How could I allow myself
to do something so stupid?

679
00:52:57,126 --> 00:52:59,459
"And why is it
still happening?"

680
00:53:01,292 --> 00:53:03,126
We women are
more emotional...

681
00:53:03,209 --> 00:53:04,626
I hate you.

682
00:53:05,667 --> 00:53:06,959
Don't say "hate."

683
00:53:07,042 --> 00:53:08,501
Why not? I mean it.

684
00:53:09,376 --> 00:53:12,542
You think you mean it,
in this moment. You're trying to hurt me.

685
00:53:12,626 --> 00:53:13,834
Exactly.

686
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:18,542
I know what you do
with that sad, dumb policeman.

687
00:53:25,376 --> 00:53:26,917
He's not dumb.

688
00:53:27,917 --> 00:53:30,167
But I guess
he is kind of sad.

689
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:33,542
Anyway,
we shouldn't discuss that.

690
00:53:33,626 --> 00:53:35,542
It's not appropriate
for me to even acknowledge

691
00:53:35,626 --> 00:53:38,126
what I already just said.

692
00:53:47,959 --> 00:53:49,292
Poor Suzy.

693
00:53:51,376 --> 00:53:53,834
Why is everything
so hard for you?

694
00:53:55,501 --> 00:54:00,501
We're in love. We just want to be
together. What's wrong with that?

695
00:54:05,584 --> 00:54:10,542
Oh, my God! How are we going to
get these fish hooks out?

696
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:17,042
I admit we knew
we'd get in trouble. That part's true.

697
00:54:17,501 --> 00:54:21,084
We knew people would be
worried, and we still ran away, anyway.

698
00:54:21,167 --> 00:54:24,459
But something also happened,
which we didn't do on purpose.

699
00:54:24,542 --> 00:54:28,709
When we first met each other,
something happened to us.

700
00:54:30,292 --> 00:54:31,667
That's very eloquent.

701
00:54:32,292 --> 00:54:34,584
I can't argue against
anything you're saying.

702
00:54:35,251 --> 00:54:38,417
But then again,
I don't have to, 'cause you're 12 years old.

703
00:54:40,709 --> 00:54:43,626
Look, let's face it.

704
00:54:45,251 --> 00:54:48,834
You're probably a much more
intelligent person than I am.

705
00:54:49,709 --> 00:54:51,876
In fact,
I guarantee it.

706
00:54:51,959 --> 00:54:53,792
But even smart kids
stick their finger

707
00:54:53,876 --> 00:54:55,459
in electrical
sockets sometimes.

708
00:54:57,417 --> 00:54:59,834
It takes time to
figure things out.

709
00:55:00,542 --> 00:55:04,084
It's been proven by history.
All mankind makes mistakes.

710
00:55:06,084 --> 00:55:07,417
It's our job to
try to protect you

711
00:55:07,501 --> 00:55:10,709
from making the
dangerous ones, if we can.

712
00:55:10,792 --> 00:55:12,459
You want a slug?

713
00:55:22,792 --> 00:55:24,542
What's your rush?

714
00:55:24,626 --> 00:55:28,209
You've got your whole life
in front of yourself.

715
00:55:28,292 --> 00:55:29,667
Ahead of you, I mean.

716
00:55:30,001 --> 00:55:32,542
Maybe so.
Anyway, you're a bachelor.

717
00:55:34,001 --> 00:55:35,042
So are you.

718
00:55:35,126 --> 00:55:36,167
That's true.

719
00:55:38,959 --> 00:55:40,917
Did you love someone ever?

720
00:55:43,084 --> 00:55:44,292
Yes, I did.

721
00:55:44,376 --> 00:55:45,542
What happened?

722
00:55:47,459 --> 00:55:49,126
She didn't love me back.

723
00:55:49,626 --> 00:55:50,667
Ah.

724
00:55:53,667 --> 00:55:56,667
I'm sorry for your loss.

725
00:55:56,751 --> 00:55:58,542
Anyway, that's what
you're supposed to say.

726
00:56:23,626 --> 00:56:25,376
Scout Master's log.
September 4th.

727
00:56:44,626 --> 00:56:46,209
I heard he's going
to reform school.

728
00:56:46,292 --> 00:56:48,167
I heard that they're
going to take out a piece of his brain,

729
00:56:48,251 --> 00:56:49,751
send him to
an insane asylum.

730
00:56:49,834 --> 00:56:50,959
I like his girl.

731
00:56:51,042 --> 00:56:52,126
She's too scruffy for me.

732
00:56:52,209 --> 00:56:53,417
Supposedly,
they got to third base.

733
00:56:53,501 --> 00:56:55,001
That's not true.
He just felt her up.

734
00:56:55,084 --> 00:56:56,126
Over shirt or under shirt?

735
00:56:58,042 --> 00:56:59,292
Damn us.

736
00:57:03,126 --> 00:57:05,126
It's none of our business.

737
00:57:10,334 --> 00:57:14,334
This troop has been
very shabby to Field Mate Sam Shakusky.

738
00:57:14,417 --> 00:57:17,292
In fact, we've been
a bunch of mean jerks.

739
00:57:20,876 --> 00:57:22,667
Why's he so unpopular?

740
00:57:23,501 --> 00:57:26,042
I admit, supposedly,
he's emotionally disturbed,

741
00:57:26,126 --> 00:57:30,626
but he's also
a disadvantaged orphan. How would you feel?

742
00:57:30,709 --> 00:57:31,792
Nickleby?

743
00:57:32,626 --> 00:57:33,667
Deluca?

744
00:57:34,376 --> 00:57:35,417
Lazy-Eye?

745
00:57:35,917 --> 00:57:36,959
Gadge?

746
00:57:37,626 --> 00:57:40,709
He's a fellow Khaki Scout,
and he needs our help.

747
00:57:40,792 --> 00:57:42,542
Are we man enough
to give that

748
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:45,709
so part of his brain
doesn't get removed out of him?

749
00:57:46,542 --> 00:57:49,251
They were prepared
to die for each other out there.

750
00:57:52,876 --> 00:57:56,542
Okay. Okay.
What do you need?

751
00:57:56,626 --> 00:57:58,542
For starters?
Three yards of chicken wire,

752
00:57:58,626 --> 00:58:00,876
some ripped up newspapers,
and a bucket of wheat paste.

753
00:58:28,459 --> 00:58:30,876
In other words, it's over.

754
00:58:30,959 --> 00:58:34,751
I guess so.
For the moment.

755
00:58:34,834 --> 00:58:37,126
Until further notice.

756
00:58:37,209 --> 00:58:38,334
That's right.

757
00:58:38,417 --> 00:58:39,459
I understand.

758
00:58:41,001 --> 00:58:44,251
I have to do better,
for everybody.

759
00:58:44,334 --> 00:58:45,792
Except me.

760
00:58:45,876 --> 00:58:47,292
Except you.

761
00:58:48,417 --> 00:58:52,167
Well, I hope you can.
I think you will.

762
00:58:53,167 --> 00:58:55,459
You're doing
the right thing.

763
00:59:10,001 --> 00:59:12,626
Who knows what's
going to happen, Duffy?

764
00:59:12,709 --> 00:59:14,459
I'll probably
see you tomorrow.

765
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:58,209
Get out of my chimney.

766
00:59:58,292 --> 00:59:59,459
Listen to me.

767
00:59:59,542 --> 01:00:02,626
We're here for friendship.
We're going to get you off this island.

768
01:00:02,709 --> 01:00:03,792
No, thanks.

769
01:00:03,876 --> 01:00:06,209
Yes, thanks.
This is an emergency rescue.

770
01:00:06,792 --> 01:00:10,251
It's worthless to me.
There's no point, not without Suzy.

771
01:00:15,959 --> 01:00:17,209
How'd you get here?

772
01:00:17,292 --> 01:00:18,959
They snuck me down
the laundry chute

773
01:00:19,042 --> 01:00:20,917
and left a papier-mache
dummy in my bed.

774
01:00:21,292 --> 01:00:24,292
Hmm... Diversion tactics.
Good thinking.

775
01:00:41,709 --> 01:00:42,751
Where we going?

776
01:00:42,834 --> 01:00:43,876
Fort Lebanon.

777
01:00:43,959 --> 01:00:47,042
My cousin Ben runs the Supply and
Resources outpost for the Hullabaloo.

778
01:00:47,126 --> 01:00:50,376
He's a Falcon Scout,
Legionnaire. Cousin Ben'll know what to do.

779
01:00:50,459 --> 01:00:52,001
Can we trust him?

780
01:00:52,084 --> 01:00:53,917
Normally, I'd say no.

781
01:00:55,709 --> 01:00:57,542
Did you leave
another note for Lionel?

782
01:00:57,626 --> 01:00:59,709
Not this time.
He can't keep his trap shut.

783
01:00:59,792 --> 01:01:01,459
Besides, I'll probably
never see him again.

784
01:01:01,542 --> 01:01:02,584
True.

785
01:01:19,751 --> 01:01:22,251
This is the island
of St. Jack Wood,

786
01:01:22,334 --> 01:01:24,042
extending far north
from Land's End

787
01:01:24,126 --> 01:01:27,459
along the deep water channel
that leads to Broken Rock.

788
01:01:31,292 --> 01:01:35,209
A low flood plain
separates the beach from the township above.

789
01:01:35,292 --> 01:01:38,792
A small but
prosperous community.

790
01:01:38,876 --> 01:01:41,459
The barometer reads
28 inches and dropping.

791
01:01:41,542 --> 01:01:46,084
Strong winds, as you can see,
already at 22 knots.

792
01:01:49,126 --> 01:01:52,334
The time is now 4:35 a.m.

793
01:02:12,376 --> 01:02:16,876
Did you file the motion
of continuance? Peabody v. Henderson?

794
01:02:16,959 --> 01:02:18,209
It was sustained.

795
01:02:18,292 --> 01:02:19,542
Good.

796
01:02:21,126 --> 01:02:23,584
Did the judge consider
your application for leniency?

797
01:02:23,667 --> 01:02:25,001
Rogers v. Yentob?

798
01:02:25,084 --> 01:02:26,959
- He granted it.
- Great.

799
01:02:30,584 --> 01:02:32,126
I'm sorry, Walt.

800
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:37,459
It's not your fault.

801
01:02:39,376 --> 01:02:43,209
Which injuries
are you apologizing for, specifically?

802
01:02:43,292 --> 01:02:45,626
Specifically?

803
01:02:45,709 --> 01:02:48,042
Whichever ones still hurt.

804
01:02:48,959 --> 01:02:51,417
Half of those
were self-inflicted.

805
01:02:57,876 --> 01:03:01,709
I hope the roof flies off,
and I get sucked up into space.

806
01:03:02,417 --> 01:03:04,209
You'll be better
off without me.

807
01:03:06,126 --> 01:03:08,667
Stop feeling
sorry for yourself.

808
01:03:11,959 --> 01:03:13,501
Why?

809
01:03:17,792 --> 01:03:19,959
We're all
they've got, Walt.

810
01:03:27,792 --> 01:03:29,751
That's not enough.

811
01:03:38,292 --> 01:03:40,209
"'But I'm not going,
said Barnaby Jack.

812
01:03:40,292 --> 01:03:41,542
"'I'm running away
tonight for good.

813
01:03:41,626 --> 01:03:43,751
"'And this time I
won't get caught.'

814
01:03:43,834 --> 01:03:46,167
"Annabelle whispered,
'I'm coming with you.'

815
01:03:46,251 --> 01:03:48,042
"Her yellow hair,
now brown at the roots,

816
01:03:48,126 --> 01:03:49,917
"caught up in
the wind and danced.

817
01:03:50,001 --> 01:03:51,584
"Barnaby Jack
took Annabelle's hand

818
01:03:51,667 --> 01:03:54,334
"and pressed something into it
the size of a jellybean.

819
01:03:54,417 --> 01:03:57,417
"'Hide this in your socks,
and be ready at midnight."'

820
01:04:00,251 --> 01:04:01,917
Continue.

821
01:04:02,001 --> 01:04:03,042
Keep going.

822
01:04:03,126 --> 01:04:04,584
- Keep going.
- Go on.

823
01:04:04,667 --> 01:04:05,792
- We're listening.
- That's good.

824
01:04:07,626 --> 01:04:11,459
"He leapt out the window
and landed in the fresh fallen snow."

825
01:04:17,001 --> 01:04:19,626
Where's my record player?

826
01:05:30,001 --> 01:05:31,542
You're not going to
believe this one, sir.

827
01:05:31,626 --> 01:05:35,626
That Scout Master on
New Penzance has now lost his entire troop.

828
01:05:40,292 --> 01:05:42,292
Well, I'll be damned!

829
01:05:42,417 --> 01:05:43,542
Who is this bimbo?

830
01:05:43,626 --> 01:05:44,792
Couldn't say, sir.

831
01:06:01,292 --> 01:06:02,792
Be right back.

832
01:06:07,042 --> 01:06:10,834
There's a broken
gumball machine right behind the snack tent.

833
01:06:12,459 --> 01:06:14,042
I don't care how they do it
where you come from.

834
01:06:14,126 --> 01:06:17,042
You want pop? You want candy?
You want a snake bite kit?

835
01:06:17,126 --> 01:06:18,251
Get some money.

836
01:06:18,334 --> 01:06:19,917
Cousin Ben?

837
01:06:20,001 --> 01:06:22,042
Come back in five minutes.

838
01:06:25,542 --> 01:06:26,584
Is this him?

839
01:06:26,667 --> 01:06:28,667
Field Mate Sam Shakusky,
Troop 55, resigned.

840
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:30,542
He's hot. Almost too hot.
What's in the can?

841
01:06:30,626 --> 01:06:32,042
$76, but it's mostly
in nickels.

842
01:06:32,126 --> 01:06:33,209
Give it to me.

843
01:06:33,292 --> 01:06:34,917
- Your badge in seamanship?
- Yes, sir.

844
01:06:35,001 --> 01:06:37,417
Good. There's a cold water
crabber moored off Broken Rock.

845
01:06:37,501 --> 01:06:38,667
The skipper owes me an IOU.

846
01:06:38,751 --> 01:06:40,917
We'll see if he
can take you on as a claw cracker.

847
01:06:41,001 --> 01:06:42,917
It won't be an easy life,
but it's better than shock therapy.

848
01:06:43,001 --> 01:06:44,209
Thank you, sir.

849
01:06:44,292 --> 01:06:46,001
By the way,
where's the chapel tent?

850
01:06:46,084 --> 01:06:47,292
Back there,
but the padre's home with the mumps.

851
01:06:47,376 --> 01:06:48,542
Why do you ask?

852
01:06:48,626 --> 01:06:50,626
I want to bring my wife.

853
01:06:53,084 --> 01:06:54,501
But we're not married yet.

854
01:06:54,584 --> 01:06:55,709
You his girl?

855
01:06:55,792 --> 01:06:56,834
Yeah.

856
01:06:57,667 --> 01:06:59,709
Technically,
I'm a civil law scrivener.

857
01:06:59,792 --> 01:07:02,417
I'm authorized
to declare births, deaths, and marriages.

858
01:07:02,501 --> 01:07:04,084
You're kind of young.
You got a license?

859
01:07:04,167 --> 01:07:05,459
- No.
- No.

860
01:07:08,126 --> 01:07:10,001
I can't offer you
a legally binding union.

861
01:07:10,084 --> 01:07:11,584
It won't hold up in
the state, the county,

862
01:07:11,667 --> 01:07:13,042
or, frankly,
any courtroom in the world

863
01:07:13,126 --> 01:07:14,542
due to your age,
lack of a license,

864
01:07:14,626 --> 01:07:16,251
and failure to get
parental consent.

865
01:07:16,334 --> 01:07:18,917
But the ritual does
carry a very important

866
01:07:19,001 --> 01:07:20,709
moral weight
within yourselves.

867
01:07:20,792 --> 01:07:23,751
You can't enter
into this lightly. Look into my eyes.

868
01:07:23,834 --> 01:07:25,542
- Do you love each other?
- Yes, we do.

869
01:07:25,626 --> 01:07:26,709
But think about
what I'm saying.

870
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:27,834
Are you sure
you're ready for this?

871
01:07:27,917 --> 01:07:29,542
- Yes, we are.
- They're not listening to me.

872
01:07:29,626 --> 01:07:31,417
- Let me rephrase it.
- We're in a hurry.

873
01:07:31,501 --> 01:07:32,626
Are you chewing...

874
01:07:32,709 --> 01:07:34,126
Spit out the gum, sister.
In fact, everybody.

875
01:07:37,417 --> 01:07:38,667
I don't like
the snappy attitude.

876
01:07:38,751 --> 01:07:41,042
This is the most
important decision you've made in your lives.

877
01:07:41,126 --> 01:07:42,542
Go over by that trampoline
and talk it through

878
01:07:42,626 --> 01:07:45,417
before you give me
another quick answer.

879
01:08:03,292 --> 01:08:04,376
We're sure.

880
01:08:04,459 --> 01:08:06,459
Okay. Let's do a blood test.

881
01:08:06,542 --> 01:08:08,042
Under the eye of God,

882
01:08:08,126 --> 01:08:10,334
and within the boundaries of
this local jurisdiction,

883
01:08:10,417 --> 01:08:15,209
which we hereby consecrate on this
day, the 5th of September, 1965.

884
01:08:15,292 --> 01:08:16,376
That's the end
of the short form.

885
01:08:16,459 --> 01:08:18,417
Do any of the witnesses
have objections or remarks?

886
01:08:18,501 --> 01:08:20,876
Usually they don't. Skotak?

887
01:08:20,959 --> 01:08:23,167
Can we loan them the nickels?
I'm worried about their future.

888
01:08:23,251 --> 01:08:25,167
That's my fee.

889
01:08:25,251 --> 01:08:26,417
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

890
01:08:26,501 --> 01:08:29,917
What'd I just say?
That's my fee. I'm keeping the nickels.

891
01:08:38,501 --> 01:08:40,126
Okay, they can have
the tennis ball can.

892
01:08:40,876 --> 01:08:43,542
Sign here,
initial here and here.

893
01:08:44,417 --> 01:08:47,251
Take the carbon,
leave the Bible. Let's go.

894
01:10:16,667 --> 01:10:18,042
Where are they going, again?

895
01:10:18,126 --> 01:10:20,709
He's going to
work on a shrimper, if I understand correctly.

896
01:10:20,792 --> 01:10:22,709
- I wish them well.
- Me, too.

897
01:10:22,792 --> 01:10:24,584
Me, too.

898
01:10:24,667 --> 01:10:26,292
I think they're coming back.

899
01:10:29,292 --> 01:10:31,126
- Be quick, sailor!
- What happened?

900
01:10:31,459 --> 01:10:33,417
She left her
binoculars on a hook in the chapel tent.

901
01:10:34,459 --> 01:10:35,501
Just leave them.

902
01:10:35,584 --> 01:10:37,417
We can't.
It's her magic power!

903
01:10:50,459 --> 01:10:53,251
You killed your dog,
by the way.

904
01:10:53,334 --> 01:10:54,792
- Snoopy?
- Mmm-hmm.

905
01:10:56,209 --> 01:10:57,626
Well, it couldn't be helped.

906
01:11:00,459 --> 01:11:02,126
Why do you
consider me your enemy?

907
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:04,959
Because your
girlfriend stabbed me

908
01:11:05,042 --> 01:11:06,584
in the back with
lefty scissors.

909
01:11:07,459 --> 01:11:08,667
She's my wife now.

910
01:11:10,459 --> 01:11:11,751
Congratulations.

911
01:11:12,126 --> 01:11:15,959
Thank you, but I'm saying before
that, six weeks ago, from day one.

912
01:11:17,126 --> 01:11:18,959
Why don't you like me?

913
01:11:19,792 --> 01:11:22,959
Why should I?
Nobody else does.

914
01:11:34,417 --> 01:11:37,042
My God! He's here!
The fugitive! Stop him!

915
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:38,709
Stop him!

916
01:12:35,459 --> 01:12:37,792
On this spot,
I'll fight no more, forever.

917
01:12:37,876 --> 01:12:40,001
Come and get me,
you bastards!

918
01:12:54,292 --> 01:12:55,792
I'm okay.

919
01:12:59,167 --> 01:13:00,209
Follow me.

920
01:13:07,334 --> 01:13:09,084
Company, let's go!

921
01:13:18,209 --> 01:13:19,876
Captain Sharp,
we've located the missing troop.

922
01:13:19,959 --> 01:13:22,042
They just fled camp.
We're in pursuit.

923
01:13:22,126 --> 01:13:23,751
They're accompanied
by a 12-year-old girl

924
01:13:23,834 --> 01:13:25,376
in knee socks
and Sunday school shoes.

925
01:13:25,459 --> 01:13:27,542
Stand by,
Commander Pierce.

926
01:13:28,167 --> 01:13:29,876
Jed, re-route to
St. Jack Wood.

927
01:13:29,959 --> 01:13:31,917
Tell Social Services
the boy's at Fort Lebanon.

928
01:13:32,001 --> 01:13:33,042
Roger that.
Will comply.

929
01:13:33,126 --> 01:13:34,709
Notify the Bishops,
Suzy's there.

930
01:13:34,792 --> 01:13:35,876
Randy, you monitoring?

931
01:13:35,959 --> 01:13:38,084
Affirmative.
I'm on my way.

932
01:13:39,292 --> 01:13:40,334
Hello?

933
01:13:40,417 --> 01:13:41,459
Hello, Mr. Bishop?

934
01:13:41,792 --> 01:13:43,459
Oh, dear God.
Get the boys!

935
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:46,626
Let's go! Right now!

936
01:13:47,126 --> 01:13:48,667
Tower control,
this is Jed.

937
01:13:48,751 --> 01:13:52,751
Confirm coordinates for new
destination, Alpha two-two-seven-one-fiver.

938
01:13:52,834 --> 01:13:54,167
Looking pretty soupy up here.

939
01:13:54,251 --> 01:13:57,126
Wouldn't mind setting down
before the pot boils over.

940
01:13:57,209 --> 01:13:58,501
Hang on, Social Services.

941
01:14:18,417 --> 01:14:20,459
Once again, storm
waters have just breached

942
01:14:20,542 --> 01:14:22,209
the dam at
Black Beacon Reservoir.

943
01:14:22,292 --> 01:14:25,459
A flash flood
alert is in effect. Take immediate precautions

944
01:14:26,251 --> 01:14:28,042
That's coming our way.

945
01:14:28,126 --> 01:14:29,792
Did you find them?

946
01:14:29,876 --> 01:14:32,501
Prepare to mobilize
to higher ground.

947
01:14:34,834 --> 01:14:37,876
St. Jack's Church
is the designated storm shelter.

948
01:14:37,959 --> 01:14:40,959
Notify all Scouts to
muster outside my tent, on the double.

949
01:15:19,042 --> 01:15:21,042
Attention, company!

950
01:15:21,126 --> 01:15:22,751
Prepare for...

951
01:15:23,626 --> 01:15:24,959
Who's that?

952
01:15:35,251 --> 01:15:37,292
You call yourself
a Khaki Scout?

953
01:15:37,792 --> 01:15:38,834
Sorry, sir?

954
01:15:38,917 --> 01:15:41,459
Where's your goddamn troop,
you son of a bitch?

955
01:15:41,542 --> 01:15:42,876
You don't have them?

956
01:15:42,959 --> 01:15:45,334
They could get
killed out there!

957
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:48,542
I'm field stripping
you of your command.

958
01:15:57,417 --> 01:15:58,876
Attention, company!

959
01:15:58,959 --> 01:16:01,209
Prepare for
emergency evacuation!

960
01:16:01,292 --> 01:16:03,626
Sir, do you have
your medicine?

961
01:16:05,042 --> 01:16:06,834
I'll be right back.

962
01:16:41,292 --> 01:16:43,209
Hold your positions!

963
01:17:14,042 --> 01:17:15,542
Company secretary,
status report.

964
01:17:15,626 --> 01:17:17,251
All accounted for,
Scout Master!

965
01:17:17,334 --> 01:17:20,751
Okay, boys,
we're going to make a run for it! Fall in!

966
01:17:20,834 --> 01:17:23,084
Let's move!

967
01:17:23,167 --> 01:17:25,376
Come on, follow me!

968
01:17:48,792 --> 01:17:50,126
Who's in charge here?

969
01:17:50,626 --> 01:17:51,709
Randy, what happened?

970
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:52,876
Take the commander off me!

971
01:17:54,542 --> 01:17:56,542
Suzy?

972
01:17:56,626 --> 01:17:58,876
Suzy? Sam?

973
01:17:58,959 --> 01:18:00,042
They ran away again.

974
01:18:02,834 --> 01:18:04,792
We got to go back out there.
I need volunteers.

975
01:18:04,876 --> 01:18:07,042
You, and you and you.

976
01:18:07,126 --> 01:18:08,959
- You?
- Are you all right?

977
01:18:09,042 --> 01:18:10,292
Of course I am.

978
01:18:23,001 --> 01:18:24,126
Where's the boy?

979
01:18:25,042 --> 01:18:26,251
We don't know yet.

980
01:18:26,626 --> 01:18:27,667
That's not acceptable.

981
01:18:28,417 --> 01:18:30,376
What do you
want me to say, lady?

982
01:18:30,459 --> 01:18:31,792
Somebody get
Jed a cup of coffee.

983
01:18:34,001 --> 01:18:35,626
- You're Captain Sharp.
- That's correct.

984
01:18:35,709 --> 01:18:38,751
I'm Social Services. I remanded the
boy into your personal custody.

985
01:18:38,834 --> 01:18:40,167
You're responsible
for his safety.

986
01:18:40,251 --> 01:18:42,667
I'm told that
he's just been struck by lightning.

987
01:18:42,751 --> 01:18:44,084
That's the first
I've heard of it.

988
01:18:44,167 --> 01:18:45,209
It's true.

989
01:18:45,292 --> 01:18:46,584
Scout Master Ward,
I presume.

990
01:18:46,667 --> 01:18:47,709
Yes, ma'am.

991
01:18:47,792 --> 01:18:49,167
Your reputation
precedes you.

992
01:18:49,709 --> 01:18:51,667
You two are
the most appallingly

993
01:18:51,751 --> 01:18:53,251
incompetent
custodial guardians

994
01:18:53,334 --> 01:18:55,334
Social Services has
ever had the misfortune

995
01:18:55,417 --> 01:18:57,792
to encounter in
a 27-year career!

996
01:18:58,584 --> 01:19:00,167
What do you have to
say for yourselves?

997
01:19:00,251 --> 01:19:02,751
You can't do this.
They'll eat him alive in there.

998
01:19:02,834 --> 01:19:03,876
Where?

999
01:19:03,959 --> 01:19:05,376
What's the name
of the place again?

1000
01:19:05,459 --> 01:19:08,376
Juvenile Refuge.

1001
01:19:08,459 --> 01:19:10,084
Sounds like jail.

1002
01:19:10,167 --> 01:19:14,959
Just find the boy,
and deliver him to Social Services.

1003
01:19:15,042 --> 01:19:16,834
Nothing else
is in your power.

1004
01:19:16,917 --> 01:19:18,792
I'm sorry.
Can we get back to the rescue now?

1005
01:19:18,917 --> 01:19:20,542
- Suzy is still out there.
- Who are you?

1006
01:19:20,626 --> 01:19:22,751
Walt and Laura Bishop,
their daughter's the missing girl.

1007
01:19:22,834 --> 01:19:23,876
The parents of the stabber?

1008
01:19:23,959 --> 01:19:26,042
I object to that description.
She was attacked.

1009
01:19:26,126 --> 01:19:27,167
Excuse me?

1010
01:19:27,251 --> 01:19:29,542
I want the details about that.
Where's the Scout she knifed?

1011
01:19:29,626 --> 01:19:31,001
Right here.

1012
01:19:31,084 --> 01:19:33,042
- Field Mate Redford, sir.
- What's his condition?

1013
01:19:33,126 --> 01:19:34,667
He may suffer some limited
chronic kidney insufficiency.

1014
01:19:34,751 --> 01:19:35,792
Here's the report.

1015
01:19:35,876 --> 01:19:37,334
- We don't have time for that!
- She's right.

1016
01:19:37,417 --> 01:19:39,001
- Let's go.
- Stop!

1017
01:19:40,792 --> 01:19:42,459
Nobody's going anywhere.

1018
01:19:44,626 --> 01:19:46,792
He's not getting
shock therapy.

1019
01:19:47,292 --> 01:19:51,042
That's it!
I am citing you for gross misconduct.

1020
01:19:51,126 --> 01:19:52,376
You are hereby
summoned to appear...

1021
01:19:52,459 --> 01:19:53,626
I'm writing you up back!

1022
01:19:53,709 --> 01:19:56,167
Be notified that
you stand accused of mistreatment...

1023
01:19:56,251 --> 01:19:57,292
What are you talking about?

1024
01:19:57,376 --> 01:19:58,417
I won't let you do it!

1025
01:19:58,501 --> 01:19:59,542
Look!

1026
01:20:08,126 --> 01:20:09,792
- They're gone.
- Who?

1027
01:20:09,876 --> 01:20:11,667
- Suzy?
- Sam!

1028
01:20:11,751 --> 01:20:12,792
- They're here?
- Yeah.

1029
01:20:12,876 --> 01:20:15,251
Where'd they go?
Answer me!

1030
01:20:35,376 --> 01:20:37,667
Halt! Stop!

1031
01:20:43,292 --> 01:20:44,584
Stay there.

1032
01:20:44,667 --> 01:20:47,167
Wait, take these!

1033
01:21:01,917 --> 01:21:04,209
Where are you going?
What are you doing?

1034
01:21:04,292 --> 01:21:06,001
Come down!

1035
01:21:19,834 --> 01:21:22,084
Social Services,
do you read me? Over.

1036
01:21:42,209 --> 01:21:43,417
We might have to
swim for it.

1037
01:21:45,376 --> 01:21:47,751
How deep is it?
I didn't bring my life jacket.

1038
01:21:48,209 --> 01:21:50,667
I don't know, but if it's too
shallow, we'll break our necks anyway.

1039
01:21:52,834 --> 01:21:54,209
Hang on to me.

1040
01:21:55,584 --> 01:21:56,834
Okay.

1041
01:21:58,292 --> 01:22:00,501
No, I'm not married, but I'm a police officer.

1042
01:22:00,584 --> 01:22:02,376
Application denied.
I'm sorry.

1043
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:05,001
I cannot
authorize that. Over.

1044
01:22:05,084 --> 01:22:07,501
Counselors, what's
the legal perspective? Over.

1045
01:22:08,167 --> 01:22:10,709
In this state,
I would litigate with extreme confidence.

1046
01:22:10,792 --> 01:22:12,542
- I concur.
- Open with Article 15

1047
01:22:12,626 --> 01:22:14,042
of the Codes of
Civic Jurisdiction.

1048
01:22:14,126 --> 01:22:15,917
No party,
under any circumstances,

1049
01:22:16,001 --> 01:22:17,501
shall be denied due
and proper consideration

1050
01:22:17,584 --> 01:22:19,042
without prejudice
in perpetuity.

1051
01:22:19,959 --> 01:22:21,126
On three again.

1052
01:22:21,209 --> 01:22:22,376
Wait.

1053
01:22:23,209 --> 01:22:25,584
Just in case
this is a suicide

1054
01:22:25,667 --> 01:22:28,209
or they capture us
and we never see each other again anymore,

1055
01:22:28,292 --> 01:22:31,626
I just want to say
thank you for marrying me.

1056
01:22:32,959 --> 01:22:35,334
I'm glad I got
to know you, Suzy.

1057
01:22:47,917 --> 01:22:49,501
I think you've still
got lightning in you.

1058
01:22:49,917 --> 01:22:50,959
Let's jump.

1059
01:22:51,042 --> 01:22:52,667
No! God damn it!

1060
01:22:55,126 --> 01:22:56,376
Tell him. Over.

1061
01:22:56,459 --> 01:22:58,209
Captain Sharp is
offering to assume

1062
01:22:58,292 --> 01:22:59,959
the responsibility
of foster parenthood.

1063
01:23:00,959 --> 01:23:03,042
He wants you
to live with him.

1064
01:23:03,459 --> 01:23:05,792
Is this acceptable to you, Mr. Shakusky?

1065
01:23:09,376 --> 01:23:10,626
What do you think, pal?

1066
01:23:21,459 --> 01:23:23,001
We're coming down.
Over and out.

1067
01:23:23,542 --> 01:23:24,959
They're coming down.
Over and...

1068
01:23:43,042 --> 01:23:45,001
Don't let go.

1069
01:23:52,417 --> 01:23:54,042
The Black Beacon
storm was considered

1070
01:23:54,126 --> 01:23:55,876
by the US Department
of Inclement Weather

1071
01:23:55,959 --> 01:23:58,834
to be the region's
most destructive meteorological event

1072
01:23:58,917 --> 01:24:01,792
of the second half
of the 20th century.

1073
01:24:02,501 --> 01:24:06,084
It lingered through six high
tides and inundated the islands

1074
01:24:06,167 --> 01:24:09,917
with punishing winds
and extreme high waters.

1075
01:24:10,834 --> 01:24:14,792
On St. Jack Wood,
powerful surges broke the arcade boardwalk

1076
01:24:14,876 --> 01:24:18,167
and demolished
the village bandstand and casino.

1077
01:24:19,209 --> 01:24:21,834
Scout Master's log.
October 10th.

1078
01:24:21,917 --> 01:24:24,626
Reconstruction continues
increasingly ahead of schedule,

1079
01:24:25,167 --> 01:24:27,209
which I attribute to
a particularly robust

1080
01:24:27,292 --> 01:24:29,126
esprit de corps
among the troop.

1081
01:24:29,209 --> 01:24:30,417
The latrine, however,
does continue to present...

1082
01:24:30,501 --> 01:24:31,626
Excuse me, sir?

1083
01:24:31,709 --> 01:24:33,667
- You've got the new recruit?
- Yes, sir.

1084
01:24:33,751 --> 01:24:35,292
- What's his rank?
- He doesn't have one.

1085
01:24:35,376 --> 01:24:37,042
Pigeon Scout.
Let's get him a patch.

1086
01:24:37,126 --> 01:24:39,042
The coastal
areas of New Penzance

1087
01:24:39,126 --> 01:24:41,084
were battered
and changed forever.

1088
01:24:41,167 --> 01:24:42,751
Height.

1089
01:24:43,626 --> 01:24:44,834
63 inches.

1090
01:24:45,417 --> 01:24:48,251
Mile 3.25
Tidal Inlet was erased from the map.

1091
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:52,167
But harvest yields
the following autumn

1092
01:24:52,251 --> 01:24:54,959
far exceeded any
previously recorded,

1093
01:24:55,876 --> 01:24:59,667
and the quality of the crops
was said to be extraordinary.

1094
01:25:05,959 --> 01:25:08,542
<i>So you see,
the composer Benjamin Britten</i>

1095
01:25:08,626 --> 01:25:11,126
<i>has taken the whole
orchestra apart.</i>

1096
01:25:11,209 --> 01:25:14,126
<i>Now he puts it
back together again in a fugue.</i>

1097
01:25:14,209 --> 01:25:16,042
<i>The instruments come
in one after another</i>

1098
01:25:16,126 --> 01:25:19,376
<i>in the same order as before,
beginning with the piccolo.</i>

1099
01:25:19,459 --> 01:25:22,626
<i>And at the end, when all the
instruments have finally come in...</i>

1100
01:25:22,709 --> 01:25:25,167
<i>Suzy, Lionel,
Murray, Rudy, dinner!</i>

1101
01:25:25,251 --> 01:25:26,667
<i>...melody, while
the other instruments...</i>

1102
01:25:27,292 --> 01:25:29,251
<i>Don't make us
ask twice!</i>

1103
01:25:53,084 --> 01:25:54,292
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

1104
01:27:00,376 --> 01:27:02,683
For Juman

1105
01:29:46,001 --> 01:29:48,417
<i>Now we will
demonstrate the orchestration</i>

1106
01:29:48,501 --> 01:29:51,209
<i>of Monsieur Desplat's
musical suite.</i>

1107
01:29:51,292 --> 01:29:54,042
<i>A little electronic
metronome sets the time.</i>

1108
01:29:55,459 --> 01:29:57,376
<i>First, a harp.</i>

1109
01:30:02,792 --> 01:30:05,376
<i>Next, pizzicato cellos.</i>

1110
01:30:08,792 --> 01:30:11,792
<i>Flute and piccolo.</i>

1111
01:30:22,042 --> 01:30:24,001
<i>Electric guitar.</i>

1112
01:30:28,626 --> 01:30:29,917
<i>Ukulele.</i>

1113
01:30:34,167 --> 01:30:35,792
<i>Classical guitar.</i>

1114
01:30:41,334 --> 01:30:42,876
<i>Banjo.</i>

1115
01:30:49,167 --> 01:30:50,917
<i>Thin wood blocks.</i>

1116
01:30:57,417 --> 01:30:59,376
<i>And two more harps.</i>

1117
01:31:03,792 --> 01:31:05,459
<i>B-3 organ.</i>

1118
01:31:06,959 --> 01:31:08,251
<i>Celesta.</i>

1119
01:31:14,959 --> 01:31:16,959
<i>Bowed vibraphone.</i>

1120
01:31:22,001 --> 01:31:23,626
<i>And piano.</i>

1121
01:31:32,167 --> 01:31:34,376
<i>Pizzicato violins.</i>

1122
01:31:38,042 --> 01:31:39,876
<i>And double bass.</i>

1123
01:31:44,959 --> 01:31:46,542
<i>Tubular bells.</i>

1124
01:31:48,542 --> 01:31:50,209
<i>And the glockenspiel.</i>

1125
01:31:51,626 --> 01:31:53,459
<i>The ride cymbal.</i>

1126
01:31:55,084 --> 01:31:56,251
<i>Piatti.</i>

1127
01:31:59,417 --> 01:32:00,459
<i>Snare drums.</i>

1128
01:32:01,792 --> 01:32:03,251
<i>Gran casa.</i>

1129
01:32:06,626 --> 01:32:08,001
<i>Timpani!</i>

1130
01:32:11,292 --> 01:32:13,542
<i>Sixteen baritone bass singers.</i>

1131
01:32:17,292 --> 01:32:18,751
<i>Xylophone.</i>

1132
01:32:22,626 --> 01:32:24,001
<i>Bassoons.</i>

1133
01:32:26,667 --> 01:32:28,417
<i>Clarinet.</i>

1134
01:32:30,542 --> 01:32:32,084
<i>French horns.</i>

1135
01:32:34,834 --> 01:32:36,167
<i>Tenor sax.</i>

1136
01:32:41,459 --> 01:32:43,042
<i>Trombone.</i>

1137
01:32:46,917 --> 01:32:48,001
<i>Tuba!</i>

1138
01:32:52,209 --> 01:32:53,876
<i>Trumpets.</i>

1139
01:33:13,626 --> 01:33:14,876
<i>Triangle.</i>

1140
01:33:22,167 --> 01:33:24,626
<i>Thank you very
much for listening.</i>
