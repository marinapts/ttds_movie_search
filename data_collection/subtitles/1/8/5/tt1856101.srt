00:00:05,971 --> 00:00:12,584
Replicants are bioengineered humans, designed
by Tyrell Corporation for use off-world.

3
00:00:12,585 --> 00:00:16,846
Their enhanced strength
made them ideal slave labor

4
00:00:16,926 --> 00:00:25,629
After a series of violent rebellions, their manufacture
became prohibited and Tyrell Corp went bankrupt.

5
00:00:25,846 --> 00:00:33,025
The collapse of ecosystems in the mid 2020s
led to the rise of industrialist Niander Wallace,

6
00:00:33,026 --> 00:00:37,226
Whose mastery of synthetic
farming averted famine

7
00:00:37,324 --> 00:00:45,188
Wallace acquired the remains of Tyrell Corp
and created a new line of replicants who obey.

8
00:00:45,366 --> 00:00:53,171
Many older model replicants--NEXUS 8s with open-ended
lifespans--survived. They are hunted down and "Retired"

9
00:00:53,288 --> 00:00:56,591
Those that hunt them
still go by the name...

10
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:03,502
Blade Runner

11
00:04:56,775 --> 00:05:00,295
I hope you dont mind me
taking the liberty.

12
00:05:02,655 --> 00:05:04,912
I was careful not to...

13
00:05:05,061 --> 00:05:07,371
drag in any dirt.

14
00:05:08,088 --> 00:05:10,356
I dont mind the dirt.

15
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:13,995
I do mind...

16
00:05:14,535 --> 00:05:17,175
unannounced visits.

17
00:05:19,704 --> 00:05:21,568
You police?

18
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:27,550
Are you Sapper Morton,
Civic Number: NK68514?

19
00:05:27,616 --> 00:05:29,546
I'm a farmer.

20
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,327
I saw that.

21
00:05:31,855 --> 00:05:33,796
What do you farm?

22
00:05:40,821 --> 00:05:42,838
It's a protein farm...

23
00:05:43,311 --> 00:05:45,408
Wallace design.

24
00:05:46,956 --> 00:05:48,650
Is that what I smell?

25
00:05:49,202 --> 00:05:51,108
I grow that just for me.

26
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,731
- Garlic.
- Garlic...

27
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,133
You wanna try some.

28
00:05:57,935 --> 00:05:59,629
No, thank you.

29
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:05,795
I prefer to keep an empty stomach
until the hard part of the day is done.

30
00:06:08,323 --> 00:06:10,052
How long you been here?

31
00:06:10,077 --> 00:06:11,714
Since 2020.

32
00:06:12,974 --> 00:06:15,814
But you haven't always
been a farmer, have you?

33
00:06:17,432 --> 00:06:19,046
Your bag...

34
00:06:19,242 --> 00:06:21,431
It's Colonial Medical use,

35
00:06:21,542 --> 00:06:23,258
Military issue.

36
00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:28,480
Where were you? Calantha?

37
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,591
Must've been brutal.

38
00:06:35,052 --> 00:06:37,280
Plan on taking me in?

39
00:06:38,426 --> 00:06:39,821
And,...

40
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,911
take a look inside.

41
00:06:42,162 --> 00:06:43,657
Mr. Morton,

42
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,100
if taking you in is an option...

43
00:06:51,257 --> 00:06:54,146
I would much prefer that
to the alternative.

44
00:06:55,363 --> 00:06:58,584
I'm sure you knew,
it would be someone, in time.

45
00:07:00,317 --> 00:07:02,399
I'm sorry it had to be me.

46
00:07:06,035 --> 00:07:07,946
Good as any.

47
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,381
Now,...

48
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:14,681
if you don't mind,

49
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:18,361
if you could just look up
and to the left, please.

50
00:08:15,007 --> 00:08:17,095
Please don't get up.

51
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:31,210
How does it feel
killing your own kind?

52
00:08:34,869 --> 00:08:38,376
I don't retire my own kind,
because we don't run.

53
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,221
Only you older models do.

54
00:08:42,246 --> 00:08:46,737
And you new models are happy
just cleaning the shit.

55
00:08:51,225 --> 00:08:53,909
Because you have
never seen a miracle.

56
00:09:35,015 --> 00:09:37,107
Just photograph everything.

57
00:09:48,744 --> 00:09:50,637
Madam, please.

58
00:09:50,848 --> 00:09:53,713
<i>Incoming LAPD recoded cache.*</i>

59
00:09:56,651 --> 00:09:59,639
<i>Youre hurt.
I'm not paying for that.</i>

60
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,625
- I'll glue it.
<i>- And?...</i>

61
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:10,582
<i>One of the tail-end Nexus 8s.</i>

62
00:10:10,613 --> 00:10:14,481
- <i>He looks like he could take
your head off.</i> - He tried.

63
00:10:14,506 --> 00:10:16,645
<i>He went AWOL after Calantha.</i>

64
00:10:16,704 --> 00:10:20,082
<i>With a few more in his outfit,
I wouldn't mind closing out.</i>

65
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,601
- <i>Just him?</i>
- Just him.

66
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:25,508
<i>Come on home for your baseline.</i>

67
00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:30,999
One moment, Madam.

68
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:21,084
30 meters to maximum depth.

69
00:11:36,665 --> 00:11:38,244
<i>What is that?</i>

70
00:11:43,456 --> 00:11:45,441
<i>I'll send a dig-team.</i>

71
00:11:46,313 --> 00:11:48,262

74
00:13:05,764 --> 00:13:09,445
<i>Officer KD6-3.7, let's begin.</i>

75
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,562
- <i>Ready?</i>
- Yessir.

76
00:13:12,731 --> 00:13:14,364
<i>Reset your baseline.</i>

77
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:17,576
And blood-black
nothingness began to spin

78
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:21,926
A system of cells
interlinked within cells,

79
00:13:21,951 --> 00:13:25,247
interlinked within cells,
interlinked within one stem.

80
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:27,077
Fuck off, skin-job!

81
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:33,501
And dreadfully distinct against
the dark, a tall white fountain played...

82
00:13:34,664 --> 00:13:35,957
- <i>Cells.</i>
- Cells.

83
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,889
<i>Have you ever

00:13:37,914 --> 00:13:39,206

00:13:39,207 --> 00:13:40,500
<i>Do they keep you in a cell?</i>

86
00:13:40,501 --> 00:13:41,794
- <i>Cells.</i>
- Cells.

87
00:13:41,795 --> 00:13:44,681
<i>When you're not performing your duties,
do they keep you in a little box?</i>

88
00:13:44,682 --> 00:13:45,775

94
00:13:54,237 --> 00:13:55,928
<i>Do you long for having
your heart interlinked?</i>

95
00:13:55,929 --> 00:13:57,321
- <i>Interlinked.</i>
- Interlinked.

96
00:13:57,322 --> 00:13:59,113
<i>Do you dream about

97
00:13:59,114 --> 00:13:59,909
Interlinked.

Within cells interlinked.

What's up you beautiful tinplate soldier?

119
00:15:06,895 --> 00:15:10,666
So you come home now, you idiot?

120
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,892
Who the hell is waiting for you, here?

121
00:15:12,965 --> 00:15:15,654
I'll kick your leg out you skinner!

122
00:15:41,036 --> 00:15:44,554
K, I didn't hear you.
You're early.

123
00:15:44,619 --> 00:15:46,611
You want me to come back?

124
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:49,137
- Just go scrub.
- Yes ma'am.

125
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:52,761
How was your meeting?

126
00:15:54,468 --> 00:15:56,262
The usual.

127
00:15:56,616 --> 00:15:58,641
- How was your day?
- Oh...

128
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,743
I'm getting cabin fever.

129
00:16:02,498 --> 00:16:05,691
<i>99.9% detoxified water.</i>

130
00:16:09,289 --> 00:16:11,580
I had an accident at work.

131
00:16:12,131 --> 00:16:14,123
Think I ruined my shirt.

132
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,526
I'm sure I can fix that for you.

133
00:16:16,551 --> 00:16:18,556
Let me take a look at it

134
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,152
I need a drink.

135
00:16:27,037 --> 00:16:30,725
- You want a drink, first?
- M-hm. Pour me one, will you?

136
00:16:32,434 --> 00:16:34,028
I'm trying a new recipe.

137
00:16:34,138 --> 00:16:36,140
I just need a bit more practice.

138
00:16:36,165 --> 00:16:37,794
Don't fuss.

139
00:16:40,308 --> 00:16:42,573
Should have marinate it longer.

140
00:16:42,695 --> 00:16:44,503
Hope it isn't dry.

141
00:16:46,616 --> 00:16:51,306
Did you know this song was released
in 1966, on Reprise Records?

142
00:16:51,923 --> 00:16:54,154
It was number one on the charts.

143
00:16:59,242 --> 00:17:00,826
It won't be much longer.

144
00:17:00,851 --> 00:17:03,422
Just putting on the
finishing touches.

145
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:11,155
OK it's ready.
I hope you're gonna like it.

146
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,138
I told you not to fuss.

147
00:17:14,942 --> 00:17:16,761
And yet....

148
00:17:19,346 --> 00:17:22,075
Voilà. Bon appétit.

149
00:17:24,734 --> 00:17:26,786
I missed you baby sweet.

150
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:30,623
Honey, it's beautiful.

151
00:17:30,852 --> 00:17:32,716
Just put your feet up.

152
00:17:33,389 --> 00:17:35,182
Relax.

153
00:17:53,213 --> 00:17:55,205
Was a day, hm?

154
00:17:56,418 --> 00:17:58,199
It was a day.

155
00:17:59,014 --> 00:18:00,976
Would you read to me?

156
00:18:02,312 --> 00:18:03,866
It'll make you feel better.

157
00:18:03,935 --> 00:18:05,451
You hate that book.

158
00:18:05,486 --> 00:18:07,365
I don't wanna read it either.

159
00:18:09,093 --> 00:18:10,420
Let's Dance.

160
00:18:10,445 --> 00:18:13,001
Do you wanna dance or
do you wanna open your present?

161
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,636
What present?

162
00:18:18,457 --> 00:18:19,965
This one.

163
00:18:20,063 --> 00:18:21,715
What's the occasion?

164
00:18:21,846 --> 00:18:23,738
Let's just say...

165
00:18:24,071 --> 00:18:25,743
it's our anniversary.

166
00:18:25,818 --> 00:18:27,345
Is it?

167
00:18:28,352 --> 00:18:30,024
No but...

168
00:18:30,938 --> 00:18:32,930
let's just say that it is.

169
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:34,954
OK?

170
00:18:38,496 --> 00:18:40,223
Happy Anniversary.

00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:43,092

00:19:25,573 --> 00:19:27,009
Thank you.

173
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:31,132
Honey, you can go anywhere,
you want, in the world, now.

174
00:19:32,241 --> 00:19:34,358

180
00:20:02,476 --> 00:20:04,608
(...)*

181
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:11,554
(...)*

182
00:20:14,114 --> 00:20:16,254
(...)*

183
00:20:19,356 --> 00:20:21,309
(...)*

184
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,572
(...)*

185
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,859
(...)*

186
00:20:35,957 --> 00:20:38,223
(...)*

187
00:20:41,314 --> 00:20:43,330
(...)*

188

(...)*

189
00:20:56,729 --> 00:20:58,370
(...)*

190
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,724
(...)*

191
00:21:48,212 --> 00:21:50,715
I'm so happy when I"m with you.

192
00:21:52,843 --> 00:21:55,011
You don't have to to say that.

193
00:22:26,158 --> 00:22:28,939
<i>The dig's come through.
W have a new lead.</i>

194
00:22:29,636 --> 00:22:31,276
<i>Get down here.</i>

195
00:22:44,773 --> 00:22:48,946
<i>Carbon read: 14.6 GPH.</i>

196
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:13,276
Your box is a military foot-locker,
issued to Sapper Morton,

197
00:23:13,611 --> 00:23:16,468
creatively repurposed as an ossuary.

198
00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:18,156
A box of bones.

199
00:23:18,567 --> 00:23:20,559
Nothing else in it, but hair.

200
00:23:21,705 --> 00:23:25,986
The soil samples indicate that
she's been buried for 30 years.

201
00:23:26,551 --> 00:23:30,829
The bones, all dismantled, fully cleaned,
meticulously laid to rest

202
00:23:30,891 --> 00:23:32,486
She?

203
00:23:33,751 --> 00:23:35,668
Cause of death, Coco?

204
00:23:46,219 --> 00:23:49,843
No breaks, no sign of trauma except...

205
00:23:50,627 --> 00:23:53,118
fracture through the ilium.

206
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:56,784
That's a narrow birth canal.
Baby must've got stuck.

207
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,753
- She was pregnant?
- M-hm.

208
00:24:00,018 --> 00:24:03,710
- So he didn't kill her?
- No, she died in childbirth.

209
00:24:05,522 --> 00:24:07,048
What's that?

210
00:24:08,102 --> 00:24:09,642
Go back.

211
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,931
Closer.

212
00:24:13,264 --> 00:24:14,858
Closer.

213
00:24:17,568 --> 00:24:19,222
That.

214
00:24:20,804 --> 00:24:22,197
Huh...

215
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:25,708
A notch in the iliac crest.

216
00:24:26,237 --> 00:24:29,540
A fine pont, like a scalpel.

217
00:24:30,546 --> 00:24:33,197
Looks like an emergency C-section.

218
00:24:33,663 --> 00:24:37,148
The cuts are clean,
no sign of a struggle.

219
00:24:37,918 --> 00:24:39,741
He was a combat medic.

220
00:24:40,473 --> 00:24:42,770
Maybe he tried to save her
and he just couldn't.

221
00:24:42,809 --> 00:24:44,858
He didn't seem like the saving type.

222
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:47,317
He went to the trouble
of burying her.

223
00:24:47,525 --> 00:24:49,666
Sentimental skin job.

224
00:24:51,622 --> 00:24:53,056
Sorry.

225
00:24:53,467 --> 00:24:55,339
So, where's the kid?

226
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:58,610
You scanned the whole field?

227
00:24:58,649 --> 00:25:01,266
Just dirt and worms,
no other bodies.

228
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,922
Maybe he ate it.

229
00:25:51,788 --> 00:25:53,737
That's not possible.

230
00:25:56,206 --> 00:25:58,099
She was a replicant.

231
00:26:00,662 --> 00:26:02,324
Pregnant.

232
00:26:11,285 --> 00:26:16,361
The world is built on a wall
that separates kind.

233
00:26:17,488 --> 00:26:21,073
Tell either side, there's no wall,
you bought a war.

234
00:26:21,703 --> 00:26:23,370
Or a slaughter.

235
00:26:27,096 --> 00:26:29,089
So, what you saw...

236
00:26:31,085 --> 00:26:32,937
didn't happen.

237
00:26:34,668 --> 00:26:36,136
Yes Madam.

238
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:39,046
It is my job to keep order.

239
00:26:39,162 --> 00:26:42,051
That's what we do here,
we keep order.

240
00:26:43,925 --> 00:26:45,619
You want it gone?

241
00:26:47,086 --> 00:26:48,777
Eraae everything.

242
00:26:48,826 --> 00:26:51,644
- Even the child?
- All trace.

243
00:26:55,878 --> 00:26:58,047
You have anything more to say?

244
00:26:59,713 --> 00:27:02,773
I never retired something
that was born, before.

245
00:27:03,764 --> 00:27:05,652
What's the difference?

246
00:27:09,567 --> 00:27:12,057
To be born is to have a soul, I guess.

247
00:27:13,134 --> 00:27:15,027
Are you telling me, no?

248
00:27:16,007 --> 00:27:18,558
I wasn't aware that
was an option, Madam.

249
00:27:18,594 --> 00:27:20,230
Attaboy.

250
00:27:23,296 --> 00:27:24,692
Hey.

251
00:27:24,873 --> 00:27:27,064
You've getting on fine, without one.

252
00:27:27,455 --> 00:27:29,010
What's that, Madam?

253
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,852
A soul.

254
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:48,127
(...)*

255
00:27:48,752 --> 00:27:52,167
(...)*

256
00:28:17,584 --> 00:28:22,562
<i>And you new models are happy
just cleaning the shit.</i>

257
00:28:24,673 --> 00:28:27,219
<i>Because you've
never seen a miracle.</i>

258
00:28:43,787 --> 00:28:50,283
Wallace Corporation
Earth Headquarters

259
00:28:51,222 --> 00:28:53,789
Just checking in
on an old serial number.

260
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:00,572
Confirmation DNA?

261
00:29:01,494 --> 00:29:03,268
I have hair.

262
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:21,795
Oh!

263
00:29:22,122 --> 00:29:23,732
An old one.

264
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:26,264
Pre-Blackout.

265
00:29:27,444 --> 00:29:29,636
Ah, it's gonna be tough.

266
00:29:30,597 --> 00:29:34,083
Not much from then,
and what's there is...

267
00:29:34,738 --> 00:29:36,532
thick milky.*

268
00:29:37,412 --> 00:29:40,297
You can customize them
as much as you'd like.

269
00:29:40,673 --> 00:29:43,063
As human as you want them to be.

270
00:29:43,554 --> 00:29:46,851
But, your operation is strictly
a drill site, isn't it?

271
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:51,548
I wouldn't waste your money on
intelligence, attachment or appeal.

272
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:55,974
Unless you'd like to add some
pleasure models to your order.

273
00:30:09,296 --> 00:30:12,473
Would it be possible to reschedule,
this call a ways?*

274
00:30:14,935 --> 00:30:18,388
Everyone remembers where they
were at the Blackout. You?

275
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,772
That was a little before before my time.

276
00:30:20,828 --> 00:30:24,310
I was at home with my folks,
and ten days of darkness.

277
00:30:24,444 --> 00:30:26,114
Every machine stopped cold.

278
00:30:26,139 --> 00:30:28,656
When the lights came back,
we were wiped clean:

279
00:30:28,681 --> 00:30:32,517
photos, files, every bit of data... gone.

280
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:35,535
Bank records, too.
Didn't mind that!

281
00:30:35,638 --> 00:30:37,727
It's funny, it's only paper that lasted.

282
00:30:37,751 --> 00:30:41,618
I mean, we had everything on drives.
Everything, everything, everything.

283
00:30:43,003 --> 00:30:46,091
My mom still cries over
the lost baby pictures.

284
00:30:46,227 --> 00:30:49,526
Well, it's a shame.
You must've been adorable.

285
00:30:49,613 --> 00:30:51,644
Hm... Ah!

286
00:30:55,774 --> 00:30:58,563
Pretty fractured, not much on it.

287
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:02,066
One of the last Gens, pre-prohibition.

288
00:31:02,313 --> 00:31:05,566
Standard issue, made by Tyrell.

289
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,745
And?

290
00:31:07,986 --> 00:31:11,074
- Unremarkable.
- Unremarkable?

291
00:31:11,247 --> 00:31:14,187
There must be something
else we can find, right?*

292
00:31:21,552 --> 00:31:24,142
Another prodigal serial number
returned.

293
00:31:25,673 --> 00:31:28,561
A 30 year old open case, finally closed.

294
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,949
Thank you, Officer.

295
00:31:31,874 --> 00:31:34,289
I'm here for Mr. Wallace, I'm Luv.

296
00:31:36,445 --> 00:31:38,180
He named you.

297
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,656
Must be special.

298
00:31:41,246 --> 00:31:44,172
I'm here for Mr. Wallace. Follow me.

299
00:31:50,586 --> 00:31:54,072
The ancient models give
the entire endeavour a bad name.

300
00:31:55,364 --> 00:32:00,044
What a gift, don't you think,
from Mr. Wallace to the world?

301
00:32:03,153 --> 00:32:06,908
The outer colonies would never have
flourished had he not bought Tyrell.

302
00:32:06,956 --> 00:32:09,048
Revivified the technology.

303
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:11,987
To say the least of what we do.

304
00:32:15,317 --> 00:32:17,364
I see you're also a customer.

305
00:32:17,683 --> 00:32:20,200
Are you satisfied with
our product?

306
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:24,074
She's very realistic. Thank you.

307
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,358
Here. All the junk is in here.

308
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,568
Lucky for you, Mr Wallace
is a data hoarder.

309
00:32:43,077 --> 00:32:45,316
No one's been down here in ages.

310
00:32:48,255 --> 00:32:50,081
Sorry about that.

311
00:33:01,422 --> 00:33:06,055
All our memory bearings from the time.
They were all damaged in the Blackout.

312
00:33:06,404 --> 00:33:08,899
But there are, sometimes, fragments.

313
00:33:24,692 --> 00:33:26,226
<i>You've got a little boy.</i>

314
00:33:26,218 --> 00:33:28,943
<i>He shows you his butterfly
collection, plus the kill jar.</i>

315
00:33:28,975 --> 00:33:30,911
<i>I'd take him to the doctor.</i>

316
00:33:33,318 --> 00:33:36,690
- <i>There's a wasp crawling on your arm.
- I'd kill it.</i>

317
00:33:38,726 --> 00:33:42,828
<i>You're reading a magazine and you come
across a full page nude photo of a girl.</i>

318
00:33:42,859 --> 00:33:46,021
<i>Is this testing whether I'm a replicant
or a lesbian, Mr. Deckard?</i>

319
00:33:46,046 --> 00:33:48,365
<i>Just answer the question, please.</i>

320
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:55,552
It was unclear what she was.
At least, to someone.

321
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,309
This was a test.

322
00:33:57,897 --> 00:34:00,089
We were difficult to spot, then.

323
00:34:01,794 --> 00:34:05,033
Was there anything unusual
about how you found her?

324
00:34:05,183 --> 00:34:07,800
To warrant an official investigation?

325
00:34:10,232 --> 00:34:13,372
You know how people are
about old serial numbers.

326
00:34:13,883 --> 00:34:17,496
Everyone just sleeps better
when they know where they got to.

327
00:34:20,252 --> 00:34:21,827
She likes him.

328
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,569
Who?

329
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:27,121
This is Officer Deckard.

330
00:34:28,314 --> 00:34:30,319
She's trying to provoke him.

331
00:34:33,711 --> 00:34:37,097
It is invigorating being
asked personal questions.

332
00:34:37,394 --> 00:34:39,088
Makes one feel...

333
00:34:40,319 --> 00:34:42,259
desired.

334
00:34:43,082 --> 00:34:45,289
Do you enjoy your work, Officer?

335
00:34:49,691 --> 00:34:52,114
Please thank Mr. Wallace for your time.

336
00:35:04,384 --> 00:35:08,069
You worked with Officer Deckard,
back in the day.

337
00:35:08,823 --> 00:35:10,891
What can you tell me about him?

338
00:35:11,387 --> 00:35:13,579
He liked to work alone.

339
00:35:14,565 --> 00:35:16,410
So did I.

340
00:35:18,371 --> 00:35:21,558
So we worked together,
to keep it that way

341
00:35:22,806 --> 00:35:24,409
That was it.

342
00:35:25,394 --> 00:35:27,713
Anything else you can tell me?

343
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:31,681
He wasn't long for this world.

344
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:35,545
How, so?

345
00:35:37,674 --> 00:35:40,065
Something in his eyes.

346
00:35:43,163 --> 00:35:45,653
Any idea how I could contact him?

347
00:35:45,949 --> 00:35:47,473
None.

348
00:35:48,836 --> 00:35:51,127
He's <i>nyugdiash</i>.

349
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,743
Retired.

350
00:35:57,095 --> 00:35:58,627
What happened?

351
00:35:58,652 --> 00:36:01,142
Probably got what he wanted.

352
00:36:03,376 --> 00:36:05,169
To be alone.

353
00:36:30,012 --> 00:36:32,005
Welcome back, sir.

354
00:36:33,342 --> 00:36:37,133
You wanted to review the
new model, sir, before shipment?

355
00:36:38,057 --> 00:36:42,465
An angel should never
enter the Kingdom of Heaven

356
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,817
without a gift.

357
00:36:47,062 --> 00:36:50,548
Can you at least pronounce
"a child is born"?

358
00:36:53,082 --> 00:36:54,707
Hm...

359
00:36:59,657 --> 00:37:01,133
Ahh.

360
00:37:01,466 --> 00:37:03,269
New model.

361
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:13,151
Let us see her, then.

362
00:38:01,564 --> 00:38:04,213
First thought

363
00:38:06,798 --> 00:38:08,791
one tends to fear

364
00:38:10,032 --> 00:38:12,024
to preserve the clay.

365
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,518
It's fascinating.

366
00:38:17,544 --> 00:38:20,287
Before we even know
what we are,

367
00:38:22,562 --> 00:38:24,287
we fear to lose it.

368
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,691
Happy Birthday.

369
00:38:29,738 --> 00:38:31,511
Shh...

370
00:39:26,796 --> 00:39:28,888
We make angels.

371
00:39:29,943 --> 00:39:34,140
That is how I took us
to nine new worlds.

372
00:39:37,206 --> 00:39:38,701
Nine...

373
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:43,815
A child can count
to nine on fingers.

374
00:39:43,844 --> 00:39:46,682
We should own the stars!

375
00:39:46,714 --> 00:39:48,291
Yes, sir.

376
00:39:51,133 --> 00:39:53,581
Every leap of
civilization was built

377
00:39:53,606 --> 00:39:56,262
off the back of a
disposable work force.

378
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:59,299
We lost our stomach for slaves,

379
00:39:59,535 --> 00:40:01,610
unless engineered.

380
00:40:04,768 --> 00:40:07,059
But I can only make so many.

381
00:40:12,763 --> 00:40:15,154
That barren pasture,

382
00:40:15,879 --> 00:40:19,129
empty and salted.

383
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:22,580
Right here.

384
00:40:24,677 --> 00:40:28,063
The dead space between the stars.

385
00:40:30,093 --> 00:40:33,280
And this, the seed that we
must change for heaven?*

386
00:40:38,274 --> 00:40:40,102
I cannot breed them,

387
00:40:40,306 --> 00:40:42,860
so help me, I have tried.

388
00:40:43,662 --> 00:40:46,746
We need more replicants
than can ever be assembled.

389
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:50,417
Millions, so we can be trillions more.

390
00:40:52,247 --> 00:40:55,210
We could storm Eden and retake her.*

391
00:41:07,574 --> 00:41:10,065
Tyrell's final trick,

392
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,553
procreation.

393
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:16,036
Perfected and lost.

394
00:41:17,129 --> 00:41:19,520
But there is a child.

395
00:41:22,106 --> 00:41:23,999
Bring it to me.

396
00:41:24,296 --> 00:41:25,989
Sir.

397
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:36,184
The best angel of all.

398
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:39,153
Aren't you, Luv?

399
00:42:57,083 --> 00:43:00,576
The man with the green jacket,
the one who killed Sapper.

400
00:43:00,622 --> 00:43:02,615
Find out what he knows.

401
00:43:21,844 --> 00:43:23,340
Hi.

402
00:43:24,302 --> 00:43:26,593
Hello, hello, A-boy.

403
00:43:26,814 --> 00:43:28,608
You alone?

404
00:43:43,144 --> 00:43:45,179
Wanna buy a lady a cigarette?

405
00:43:51,804 --> 00:43:54,037
Aw, you don't even smile.

406
00:43:56,282 --> 00:43:58,271
Didn't you hear your friends?

407
00:43:58,634 --> 00:44:00,640
Don't you know what I am?

408
00:44:00,749 --> 00:44:02,203
Yeah.

409
00:44:02,531 --> 00:44:04,524
A guy eating rice.

410
00:44:05,738 --> 00:44:07,245
What's that?

411
00:44:08,357 --> 00:44:09,917
It's a tree.

412
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:13,036
Oh. Never seen a tree before.

413
00:44:14,896 --> 00:44:16,538
It's pretty.

414
00:44:18,418 --> 00:44:20,122
It's dead.

415
00:44:21,564 --> 00:44:26,045
Now, who keeps a dead tree?

416
00:44:29,346 --> 00:44:30,853
Mm...

417
00:44:33,185 --> 00:44:35,075
You're not gonna kill me are you?

418
00:44:35,116 --> 00:44:38,502
It depends.
What's your model number?

419
00:44:38,701 --> 00:44:41,579
Why don't you look into my eye
and find out.

420
00:44:43,852 --> 00:44:45,228
Oh!

421
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:48,033
You don't like real girls.

422
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:54,078
Well, I'm always here.

423
00:48:32,977 --> 00:48:34,684
Hi.

424
00:48:36,117 --> 00:48:37,772
You can't take those.

425
00:48:37,929 --> 00:48:41,245
Of course not. Proper channels
and paperwork. It's all here.

426
00:48:41,246 --> 00:48:42,771
Hold this for me?

427
00:48:44,599 --> 00:48:46,592
Yup, here you go.

428
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:05,604
Coco is dead.

429
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:09,546
Bones are gone.

430
00:49:10,174 --> 00:49:13,980
It's out. Already out.
How long did that take?

431
00:49:14,681 --> 00:49:17,746
So, what you have for me?
And don't say, nothing.

432
00:49:18,547 --> 00:49:20,246
I found that.

433
00:49:20,959 --> 00:49:22,498
A sock?

434
00:49:24,443 --> 00:49:26,652
- Where'd you find it?
- Sapper's.

435
00:49:26,682 --> 00:49:29,524
- Anything else?
- I burned everything else.

436
00:49:29,555 --> 00:49:33,668
Then what's this? What's that date?
Is that a birthday? Is that a death day?

437
00:49:33,701 --> 00:49:35,437
I don't know yet.

438
00:49:38,902 --> 00:49:41,753
Am I the only one that can
see the fuckin' sun rise, here?

439
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,689
This breaks the world, K.

440
00:49:57,083 --> 00:49:59,613
You know, I've known
a lot of your kind.

441
00:50:01,775 --> 00:50:03,568
All useful but...

442
00:50:04,025 --> 00:50:06,515
with you I, sometimes, forget.

443
00:50:07,243 --> 00:50:10,042
We didn't have any of you
when I was a kid.

444
00:50:15,649 --> 00:50:18,139
Do you remember anything?

445
00:50:18,716 --> 00:50:22,340
Before you were under me, do you
have any memories from begore?

446
00:50:22,404 --> 00:50:24,695
I have memories, but...

447
00:50:26,254 --> 00:50:28,778
They're not real, they're just implants.

448
00:50:29,967 --> 00:50:33,552
Tell me one,
from when you were a kid.

449
00:50:38,274 --> 00:50:40,991
I feel a little strange
sharing a childhood story

450
00:50:41,016 --> 00:50:43,131
considering I was never a child.

451
00:50:45,121 --> 00:50:48,600
Would it help you to share,
if I told you it was an order?

452
00:50:51,252 --> 00:50:54,002
I have one about a toy
that I had,

453
00:50:54,065 --> 00:50:55,759
a wooden horse,

454
00:50:57,109 --> 00:50:59,174
with an inscription underneath.

455
00:51:02,185 --> 00:51:06,068
All I remember is, a group of boys
trying to take it away from me.

456
00:51:06,546 --> 00:51:08,059
So, I run.

457
00:51:33,121 --> 00:51:34,997
I go looking for a place
to hide,

458
00:51:35,028 --> 00:51:37,497
and the only place is
this dark furnace.

459
00:51:39,112 --> 00:51:42,597
It's very dark,
I'm very scared, but,

460
00:51:42,795 --> 00:51:46,181
this horse is all I have,
so, I go in anyway.

461
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,491
Later on, those kids find me

462
00:52:00,516 --> 00:52:04,120
and they beat me to tell them
where it is, but I don't.

463
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:11,859
That's it.

464
00:52:12,686 --> 00:52:14,022
Hm...

465
00:52:14,408 --> 00:52:17,014
Little K fighting for what's his.

466
00:52:18,626 --> 00:52:20,336
It's a good one.

467
00:52:26,835 --> 00:52:28,339
Look at me.

468
00:52:30,709 --> 00:52:33,598
We're all just looking out
for something real.

469
00:52:38,564 --> 00:52:40,901
What happens if I finish that?

470
00:52:44,654 --> 00:52:47,057
Shouldn't I get back to work, Madam?

471
00:52:56,359 --> 00:52:58,550
Check back in after DNAs.

472
00:53:11,976 --> 00:53:14,750
Officer KD6-3.7.

473
00:53:14,852 --> 00:53:16,579
(...)*

474
00:53:17,597 --> 00:53:19,065
Request:

475
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:22,785
DNA records,
children born 6.10.21.

476
00:53:23,124 --> 00:53:25,116
Looking for anomalies.

477
00:53:25,413 --> 00:53:29,595
(...)*

478
00:53:32,637 --> 00:53:34,408
You have the Sat Crystal back-up?

479
00:53:34,433 --> 00:53:37,122
(...)*

480
00:53:40,451 --> 00:53:43,034
OK. Run it raw.

481
00:53:43,059 --> 00:53:44,487
<i>Hai.

482
00:54:19,957 --> 00:54:22,049
M..* data makes the man.

483
00:54:23,929 --> 00:54:26,519
A and C and T and G.

484
00:54:26,953 --> 00:54:30,907
The alphabet of you,
all from four symbols.

485
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:34,115
I'm only two...

486
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:39,105
one and zero.

487
00:54:39,395 --> 00:54:42,987
Half as much, but twice as
elegant, sweetheart.

488
00:54:44,026 --> 00:54:46,118
You don't prefer your Madam?

489
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:50,230
You were listening.

490
00:54:51,156 --> 00:54:52,651
Maybe.

491
00:54:54,401 --> 00:54:57,297
You didn't like her enough
to tell her the truth.

492
00:54:57,979 --> 00:55:00,170
6, 10 and 21.

493
00:55:04,126 --> 00:55:06,118
There's nothing to tell.

494
00:55:06,518 --> 00:55:09,626
How many times have you
told me that story?

495
00:55:11,729 --> 00:55:13,622
Your memory.

496
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,875
The date carved beneath.

497
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:19,426
6, 10 and 21.

498
00:55:21,329 --> 00:55:23,168
Coincidence?

499
00:55:27,141 --> 00:55:29,532
A dangerous coincidence.

500
00:55:33,031 --> 00:55:35,621
I always knew you were special.

501
00:55:36,965 --> 00:55:38,996
Maybe this is how.

502
00:55:44,062 --> 00:55:45,733
A child...

503
00:55:46,252 --> 00:55:48,643
of woman born,

504
00:55:49,752 --> 00:55:52,142
pushed into the world,

505
00:55:53,219 --> 00:55:54,980
wanted,

506
00:55:56,006 --> 00:55:57,601
loved.

507
00:56:00,432 --> 00:56:02,623
And if it were true,

508
00:56:03,802 --> 00:56:07,482
I'd hunted for the rest of my life,
by someone just like me.

509
00:56:09,444 --> 00:56:11,735
It's OK to dream a little.

510
00:56:12,404 --> 00:56:13,927
Isn't it?

511
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:16,240
Not if you're us.

512
00:56:21,439 --> 00:56:22,953
Stop.

513
00:56:23,582 --> 00:56:27,046
But up 4847 and 2181, side by side.

514
00:56:27,071 --> 00:56:28,531
<i>Hai.

515
00:56:32,933 --> 00:56:34,627
They're identical.

516
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,124
- Translate.
- (...)*

517
00:56:39,201 --> 00:56:41,094
A boy and a girl.

518
00:56:42,526 --> 00:56:44,133
It's impossible.

519
00:56:44,976 --> 00:56:46,422
Why?

520
00:56:47,019 --> 00:56:49,829
Two people can't have identical DNA.

521
00:56:51,375 --> 00:56:53,516
One of these isn't real.

522
00:56:53,578 --> 00:56:55,218
it's a copy.

523
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:03,568
They were both processed at
the Morrill Cole orphanage.

524
00:57:05,354 --> 00:57:07,545
It says the girl died there.

525
00:57:07,725 --> 00:57:09,618
Genetic disorder.

526
00:57:10,704 --> 00:57:12,597
Galatians syndrome.

527
00:57:13,253 --> 00:57:15,017
And the boy...

528
00:57:16,982 --> 00:57:18,603
disappeares.

529
00:57:20,704 --> 00:57:22,597
Where's the orphanage?

530
00:57:24,921 --> 00:57:26,861
You wanna go for a ride?

531
00:58:17,064 --> 00:58:21,445
 Los Angeles Waste Processing
San Diego Ditrict

532
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,972
Well, here we are.

533
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:59,803
Buckle up.

534
00:59:58,848 --> 01:00:00,491
K?

535
01:00:52,124 --> 01:00:53,661
K?

536
01:00:55,466 --> 01:00:57,067
K-K?

537
01:01:50,443 --> 01:01:52,137
Stay back.

538
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:08,729
Fire again.

539
01:02:09,111 --> 01:02:10,667
Fire again.

540
01:02:12,381 --> 01:02:13,883
Fire.

541
01:02:24,882 --> 01:02:27,173
200 feet to the east.

542
01:02:29,062 --> 01:02:30,541
Fire.

543
01:02:32,347 --> 01:02:33,916
Go North.

544
01:02:35,882 --> 01:02:37,434
Fire.

545
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:41,107
Stop. 20 degrees east.

546
01:02:42,897 --> 01:02:44,292
Stop.

547
01:02:44,589 --> 01:02:46,167
Zoom in.

548
01:02:47,506 --> 01:02:49,042
Closer.

549
01:02:52,253 --> 01:02:54,376
Oh, come on!

550
01:02:55,347 --> 01:02:56,853
Get up.

551
01:02:57,253 --> 01:02:59,064
Do your fucking job.

552
01:03:00,254 --> 01:03:02,048
Find the child.

553
01:03:38,039 --> 01:03:39,633
Watch the car.

554
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:19,780
...every last piece!

555
01:05:19,805 --> 01:05:22,613
Or, I'll put you outside
where the sky is raining!

556
01:05:22,638 --> 01:05:24,630
Where it's raining fire!

557
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:26,554
You're in here to work.

558
01:05:26,585 --> 01:05:29,976
And if you're not working,
I don't need you!

559
01:05:30,073 --> 01:05:32,065
I don't need any of...

560
01:05:34,644 --> 01:05:36,152
Hi.

561
01:05:42,629 --> 01:05:45,491
The nickel is for the colonial ships.

562
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:47,919
Closest any of them, or any of us,

563
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:51,356
is gonna get to that
grand life off-worl!

564
01:05:52,429 --> 01:05:55,984
And I encourage play, I do.
Keeps them occupied and

565
01:05:56,083 --> 01:05:58,474
And it makes them nimble, right?

566
01:05:59,277 --> 01:06:01,070
But it's work.

567
01:06:01,566 --> 01:06:05,051
It's work that moulds them
into a child worth having.

568
01:06:13,709 --> 01:06:15,203
Come on, now.

569
01:06:16,662 --> 01:06:18,655
What sort do you have in mind?

570
01:06:22,166 --> 01:06:25,246
'Cause I got all kinds.

571
01:06:27,795 --> 01:06:29,741
- No no no...
- I'm not buying.

572
01:06:29,774 --> 01:06:32,857
No no no, this is just
my game and I play fair

573
01:06:32,881 --> 01:06:34,623
No, I mean...

574
01:06:34,809 --> 01:06:36,602
Biigger than you...

575
01:06:38,714 --> 01:06:41,033
Bigger than you have tried
to shut me down.

576
01:06:41,058 --> 01:06:43,221
Bigger than you, and they were m...

577
01:06:43,354 --> 01:06:45,416
They were men at that!

578
01:06:47,450 --> 01:06:50,637
A little boy came through here
about 30 years back.

579
01:06:51,033 --> 01:06:53,125
I need to see your records.

580
01:06:54,179 --> 01:06:57,067
Legitimate placements,
private sales, everything.

581
01:06:57,141 --> 01:06:59,232
Don't keep records
that far back.

582
01:06:59,257 --> 01:07:01,150
- You don't?
- I don't.

583
01:07:03,215 --> 01:07:06,269
Sorry, can't help you.

584
01:07:09,745 --> 01:07:11,638
- You can't?
- No.

585
01:07:16,215 --> 01:07:17,893
I think you can.

586
01:07:20,003 --> 01:07:22,949
I think someone like you
keeps a long memory.

587
01:07:22,974 --> 01:07:24,959
Now, you can tell me
what you remember,

588
01:07:24,984 --> 01:07:28,060
or I can put a hole right
here and take a look.

589
01:07:36,061 --> 01:07:37,510
I was...

590
01:07:37,535 --> 01:07:39,869
I was going.
I wasn't gonna leave.

591
01:07:41,707 --> 01:07:44,554
They were laughing at me
What did you say?

592
01:08:03,357 --> 01:08:05,116
Are you coming?

593
01:08:15,784 --> 01:08:17,376
Where is it?

594
01:08:20,449 --> 01:08:21,930
Oh, God.

595
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:28,814
Where, where, where?

596
01:08:31,131 --> 01:08:33,387
I can't see it. Here.

597
01:08:42,248 --> 01:08:43,817
It's gone.

598
01:08:45,936 --> 01:08:48,526
It's been torn*. The entire year.

599
01:08:50,074 --> 01:08:51,768
I didn't do that.

600
01:08:52,455 --> 01:08:53,984
It wasn't me.

601
01:08:57,488 --> 01:08:58,986
I don't...

602
01:08:59,730 --> 01:09:01,278
It wasn't me.

603
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:38,518
I always told you, you're special.

604
01:13:42,722 --> 01:13:45,825
Born, not made.

605
01:13:49,852 --> 01:13:51,696
Hidden with care.

606
01:13:55,044 --> 01:13:57,136
A real boy, now.

607
01:13:59,722 --> 01:14:02,112
A real boy needs a real name.

608
01:14:03,511 --> 01:14:05,088
Joe.

609
01:14:06,689 --> 01:14:08,189
Joe?

610
01:14:08,244 --> 01:14:10,572
You're too important for K.

611
01:14:11,367 --> 01:14:13,641
Your mother would have named you.

612
01:14:16,542 --> 01:14:17,970
Joe.

613
01:14:20,125 --> 01:14:22,317
- Joe.
- Stop!

614
01:14:28,863 --> 01:14:31,874
How do I know if a memory
is an implant, or not?

615
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,559
Who makes the memories?

616
01:15:09,096 --> 01:15:10,989
Dr. Ana Stelline?

617
01:15:14,769 --> 01:15:16,276
A visitor!

618
01:15:18,751 --> 01:15:20,229
Is that OK?

619
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:22,457
Yes.

620
01:15:24,125 --> 01:15:26,018
It's just unusual.

621
01:15:27,609 --> 01:15:32,090
Nice to meet you, Officer KD6-3.7.

622
01:15:36,268 --> 01:15:40,052
Sorry.
A compromised immune system.

623
01:15:40,548 --> 01:15:44,531
A life of freedom, so long
as it's behind glass.

624
01:15:44,892 --> 01:15:46,861
Is that why you're not off-world?

625
01:15:46,896 --> 01:15:48,376
Yes.

626
01:15:48,449 --> 01:15:52,345
My parents had our passes
in-pocket, but I took sick.

627
01:15:52,783 --> 01:15:54,223
So...

628
01:15:54,766 --> 01:15:57,554
it was a new life for me.

629
01:15:57,867 --> 01:16:01,338
Then, they put me in my cage

630
01:16:01,385 --> 01:16:04,642
filled it with everything they
could, to keep me happy,

631
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:07,081
except company, of course.

632
01:16:07,261 --> 01:16:09,228
And I was used to crowds.

633
01:16:12,498 --> 01:16:14,626
What can I help you with?

634
01:16:15,284 --> 01:16:18,294
Thought you might be able
to help me with a case.

635
01:16:19,222 --> 01:16:24,932
Now that's the most interesting thing
I've been offered to help with, in ages.

636
01:16:26,034 --> 01:16:29,420
Do you mind if I work,
while you talk?

637
01:16:30,254 --> 01:16:31,761
'Course.

638
01:16:38,476 --> 01:16:40,966
I promise I hear every word.

639
01:16:47,932 --> 01:16:50,917
Tjey say you're the best
memory maker there is.

640
01:16:51,018 --> 01:16:53,110
Well, then they're kind.

641
01:16:54,302 --> 01:16:56,594
I love birthday parties.

642
01:17:00,258 --> 01:17:02,095
You work for Wallace?

643
01:17:02,464 --> 01:17:05,869
Subcontract.
I'm one of his suppliers.

644
01:17:06,316 --> 01:17:10,517
He offered to buy me out, but I take
my freedom where I can find it.

645
01:17:11,820 --> 01:17:13,514
Why are you so good?

646
01:17:14,109 --> 01:17:16,994
What makes your
memories so authentic?

647
01:17:17,066 --> 01:17:20,979
Well, there's a bit of every
artist in their work.

648
01:17:21,674 --> 01:17:25,557
But, I was locked in this
sterile chamber at eight, so...

649
01:17:26,396 --> 01:17:29,840
If I wanted to see the world,
I had to imagine it.

650
01:17:31,428 --> 01:17:34,270
I got very good at imagining.

651
01:17:35,907 --> 01:17:39,354
Wallace needs my talent
to maintain a stable product.

652
01:17:40,784 --> 01:17:42,975
I think it's only kind.*

653
01:17:44,466 --> 01:17:46,755
Replicants live such hard lives.

654
01:17:46,810 --> 01:17:49,879
Made to do what we'd rather not.

655
01:17:50,409 --> 01:17:52,042
I can't help your future,

656
01:17:52,075 --> 01:17:56,047
but I can give you good memories
to think back on and smile.

657
01:17:57,007 --> 01:17:59,831
- That's nice.
- It's better than nice.

658
01:17:59,868 --> 01:18:01,375
It feels authentic.

659
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:04,328
And if you have authentic
memories you have...

660
01:18:04,714 --> 01:18:06,906
real human responses.

661
01:18:07,889 --> 01:18:09,574
Wouldn't you agree?

662
01:18:17,773 --> 01:18:19,761
Are all constructed, or,

663
01:18:20,163 --> 01:18:22,762
do you ever use ones
that are real?

664
01:18:26,311 --> 01:18:29,420
It's illegal to use real memories, Officer.

665
01:18:31,431 --> 01:18:33,564
How can you tell the difference?

666
01:18:33,606 --> 01:18:35,598
Can you tell if something...

667
01:18:37,173 --> 01:18:38,795
really happened?

668
01:18:40,795 --> 01:18:43,086
They all think it's about
more detail.

669
01:18:43,743 --> 01:18:46,134
But that's not how memory works.

670
01:18:46,974 --> 01:18:49,066
We remcall with our feelings.

671
01:18:49,362 --> 01:18:52,549
Anything real* should be a mess.

672
01:18:54,246 --> 01:18:56,040
I can show you.

673
01:18:57,539 --> 01:18:59,034
Sit.

674
01:19:17,277 --> 01:19:21,847
Now, think about the memory
you want me to see.

675
01:19:22,607 --> 01:19:25,097
Not even that hard,
just picture it.

676
01:19:26,190 --> 01:19:27,788
Let it play.

677
01:20:17,748 --> 01:20:20,039
Someone lived this, yes.

678
01:20:21,629 --> 01:20:23,214
This happened.

679
01:20:39,944 --> 01:20:41,678
I know it's real.

680
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:54,885
I know it's real.

681
01:20:57,901 --> 01:21:01,204
GODDAMMIT!

682
01:21:45,312 --> 01:21:49,918
<i>Officer KD6-3.7,
Madam is calling you in.</i>

683
01:21:49,949 --> 01:21:51,769
<i>You're under arrest,

684
01:21:51,794 --> 01:21:54,123

- <i>Cells.</i>
- Cells.

688
01:21:58,973 --> 01:22:01,958
<i>When you're not performing your duties,
do they keep you in a little box?</i>

01:22:01,959 --> 01:22:03,053
<i>Cells.</i>
- Cells.

01:22:03,054 --> 01:22:04,446
- <i>Interlinked.</i>
- Interlinked.

691
01:22:04,447 --> 01:22:07,432
<i>What's it like to hold the hand

01:22:07,483 --> 01:22:10,223
- <i>Interlinked.</i>

693
01:22:10,319 --> 01:22:12,483

- Within cells interlinked.

01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:13,703
- <i>Dreadfully.</i>
- Dreadfully.

695
01:22:13,704 --> 01:22:15,693
<i>What's it like to be
filled with dread?</i>

696
01:22:15,694 --> 01:22:16,788
- <i>Dreadfully.</i>
- Dreadfully.

697
01:22:16,789 --> 01:22:18,878
<i>Do you like ybeing separated
from other people?</i>

698
01:22:18,879 --> 01:22:19,973
- <i>Distinct.</i>
- Distinct.

699
01:22:19,974 --> 01:22:22,063

- <i>Against the dark.</i>
- Against the dark.

705
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:34,532
<i>A tall white fountain played.</i>

706
01:22:35,302 --> 01:22:37,494
A tall white fountain played.

707
01:22:39,919 --> 01:22:42,067
<i>You're not even close to baseline.</i>

708
01:22:48,142 --> 01:22:50,035
Out! Close the door.

709
01:22:50,929 --> 01:22:53,021
What the fuck is with you?

710
01:22:53,226 --> 01:22:55,352
I put you on a case.

711
01:22:55,384 --> 01:22:57,813
I impressed on you the
importance of that case,

712
01:22:57,845 --> 01:23:01,610
and then we pick you up fucking
around an upgrade center?!

713
01:23:03,027 --> 01:23:05,595
Scans said you didn't
look like you on the inside.

714
01:23:05,620 --> 01:23:07,574
Miles off your baseline!

715
01:23:07,605 --> 01:23:09,256
Do you know what that means?

716
01:23:09,281 --> 01:23:10,775
I found the kid.

717
01:23:15,431 --> 01:23:19,227
He was set up like a standard
replicant, put on a service job.

718
01:23:21,555 --> 01:23:23,737
Even he didn't know who he was.

719
01:23:25,742 --> 01:23:27,433
- And?
- And it's done.

720
01:23:27,458 --> 01:23:30,638
- What does that mean, 'it's done'?
- What  you asked.

721
01:23:32,036 --> 01:23:33,584
It's done.

722
01:23:41,392 --> 01:23:43,754
You just stopped a bomb
from going off.

723
01:23:45,328 --> 01:23:46,918
You did good.

724
01:23:49,127 --> 01:23:51,252
I can help you
get out of this station alive.

725
01:23:51,277 --> 01:23:54,066
But you have 48 hours
to get back on track.

726
01:23:54,331 --> 01:23:56,321
Surrender your gun and badge.

727
01:23:56,376 --> 01:23:59,563
And your next baseline test
is out of my hands.

728
01:24:01,406 --> 01:24:02,994
Thank you, Madam.

729
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:36,664
You were right.

730
01:24:43,401 --> 01:24:45,671
You were right about everything.

731
01:24:46,281 --> 01:24:47,765
Shh.

732
01:25:14,057 --> 01:25:17,443
Thought you weren't interested,
working man.

733
01:25:20,527 --> 01:25:22,619
You liked her, I could tell.

734
01:25:25,551 --> 01:25:27,067
It's OK.

735
01:25:27,793 --> 01:25:29,333
She is real.

736
01:25:31,476 --> 01:25:33,568
I wanna be real for you.

737
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:36,901
You are real for me.

738
01:25:37,961 --> 01:25:40,053
You have a special lady, here.

739
01:25:58,265 --> 01:25:59,737
OK!

740
01:26:00,058 --> 01:26:01,577
Let's do it.

741
01:26:23,333 --> 01:26:24,869
Look at you!

742
01:26:25,124 --> 01:26:27,166
Quiet, now I have to synch.

743
01:29:19,705 --> 01:29:22,978
(...)*

744
01:29:23,198 --> 01:29:26,485
<i>Joi is anything you want her to be.</i>

745
01:29:28,515 --> 01:29:31,647
<i>Joi goes anywhere you want her to go.</i>

746
01:29:33,928 --> 01:29:36,990
(...)*

747
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:05,187
<i>99.9% detoxified water.</i>

748
01:30:34,952 --> 01:30:36,444
That's from a tree.

749
01:30:36,445 --> 01:30:38,141
I'm done with you.

750
01:30:39,064 --> 01:30:40,578
You can go now.

751
01:30:52,271 --> 01:30:53,728
Quiet, now.

752
01:30:54,361 --> 01:30:56,055
I've been inside you.

753
01:30:56,705 --> 01:30:59,096
Not so much there, as you think.

754
01:31:18,149 --> 01:31:19,621
Coffee?

755
01:31:25,446 --> 01:31:27,660
They'll be coming after me, soon.

756
01:31:36,409 --> 01:31:38,070
Iml coming with you.

757
01:31:38,899 --> 01:31:40,523
But, not like this.

758
01:31:41,108 --> 01:31:43,278
If they come here,
looking for for you,

759
01:31:43,303 --> 01:31:45,678
they'll have access
to all my memories.

760
01:31:46,454 --> 01:31:49,029
You have to delete
me from the console.

761
01:31:50,038 --> 01:31:51,578
My present...

762
01:31:53,598 --> 01:31:55,140
Put me there.

763
01:31:57,312 --> 01:31:59,006
I can't do that.

764
01:32:00,495 --> 01:32:02,164
Think about it.

765
01:32:03,039 --> 01:32:05,691
If anything happens to this,
that's it.

766
01:32:06,722 --> 01:32:08,238
You're gone.

767
01:32:08,414 --> 01:32:09,925
Yes.

768
01:32:11,069 --> 01:32:12,613
Like a real girl.

769
01:32:18,665 --> 01:32:20,147
Please.

770
01:32:23,244 --> 01:32:25,037
Joe, please.

771
01:32:26,130 --> 01:32:27,807
I want this.

772
01:32:31,711 --> 01:32:33,518
But, I can't do it myself.

773
01:32:51,465 --> 01:32:53,094
Break the antenna.

774
01:33:09,518 --> 01:33:11,354
(...)*

775
01:33:24,954 --> 01:33:27,544
Real wood. You're rich, my friend.

776
01:33:28,163 --> 01:33:30,593
I can get you a real horse.

777
01:33:30,627 --> 01:33:33,314
You want a real horse?

778
01:33:33,339 --> 01:33:35,122
I don't need a real horse.

779
01:33:35,206 --> 01:33:37,992
No, I can get you one.
Like, Wallace stuff.

780
01:33:38,017 --> 01:33:40,317
I don't need a real horse.
So, just...

781
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:43,389
- Just wanna find out where it's from.
- OK.

782
01:33:46,070 --> 01:33:48,063
It smells like old dirt.

783
01:33:49,087 --> 01:33:51,473
But the structure is new.

784
01:33:53,023 --> 01:33:54,813
Radiation from a reactor?

785
01:33:54,853 --> 01:33:57,535
No, more volatile.

786
01:33:59,568 --> 01:34:01,560
It's old. It's old.

787
01:34:02,493 --> 01:34:04,570
It matches a dirty bomb.

788
01:34:04,621 --> 01:34:09,134
There's only one place where there
used to be radioactivity that strong.

789
01:34:12,531 --> 01:34:15,101
- There's only one place that dirty?
- Mm.

790
01:34:16,612 --> 01:34:18,281
Nobody lives there.

791
01:34:18,594 --> 01:34:22,147
You asked where this came from.

792
01:34:22,219 --> 01:34:24,588
Now, I've told you.

793
01:34:24,651 --> 01:34:27,819
So, what do you want?

794
01:34:28,372 --> 01:34:30,393
A horse? A goat?

795
01:34:30,487 --> 01:34:32,354
Off-world papers?

796
01:34:32,379 --> 01:34:36,737
Whatever you want,
Dr. Badger can get it for you.

797
01:35:09,165 --> 01:35:10,765
<i>Go to five.</i>

798
01:35:11,455 --> 01:35:13,796
<i>Four, 30 degrees to the left.</i>

799
01:35:16,156 --> 01:35:17,679
<i>Tilt up.</i>

800
01:35:20,244 --> 01:35:22,155
<i>Elevate to 400 feet.</i>

801
01:35:28,077 --> 01:35:30,069
<i>Radiation Analysis.</i>

802
01:35:30,195 --> 01:35:32,929
RADIATION LEVEL: NOMINAL

803
01:35:32,954 --> 01:35:34,508
<i>Move forward.</i>

804
01:35:41,315 --> 01:35:42,813
<i>Tilt up.</i>

805
01:35:43,206 --> 01:35:44,685
<i>Stop.</i>

806
01:35:46,590 --> 01:35:48,158
<i>Move forward.</i>

807
01:35:48,879 --> 01:35:50,392
<i>Go to five.</i>

808
01:35:51,543 --> 01:35:53,502
<i>Seven. Move forward.</i>

809
01:35:58,687 --> 01:36:00,131
<i>Six.</i>

810
01:36:01,459 --> 01:36:02,943
<i>Stop.</i>

811
01:36:05,532 --> 01:36:07,116
<i>Go to seven.</i>

812
01:36:07,729 --> 01:36:09,156
<i>Eight.</i>

813
01:36:10,118 --> 01:36:11,585
<i>Nine.</i>

814
01:36:15,255 --> 01:36:16,765
Heat analysis.

815
01:36:24,847 --> 01:36:26,305
Life.

816
01:36:26,901 --> 01:36:28,456
What is it?

817
01:36:29,090 --> 01:36:31,237
Guess, we're about to find out.

818
01:36:41,333 --> 01:36:43,027
Too dark in here.

819
01:36:46,097 --> 01:36:47,611
I like him.

820
01:36:48,545 --> 01:36:50,119
He's a good boy.

821
01:36:51,348 --> 01:36:52,873
Where is he?

822
01:36:59,197 --> 01:37:00,699
I've no idea.

823
01:37:01,837 --> 01:37:04,723
He's off-duty. Check around.

824
01:37:04,824 --> 01:37:06,411
I checked...

825
01:37:07,609 --> 01:37:09,673
...anywhere a good boy might go.

826
01:37:10,427 --> 01:37:12,022
You're too late.

827
01:37:15,052 --> 01:37:16,719
It's gone.

828
01:37:19,708 --> 01:37:21,501
He destroyed it.

829
01:37:23,735 --> 01:37:25,892
Everything about him.

830
01:37:26,346 --> 01:37:29,821
All except for the box of bones,
that you already took.

831
01:37:33,801 --> 01:37:37,288
Which I'll wager wasn't enough.
Here, you are.

832
01:37:45,133 --> 01:37:47,026
You tiny thing.

833
01:37:48,682 --> 01:37:53,044
In the face of the fabulous and new,
your only thought is to kill it?!

834
01:37:53,708 --> 01:37:56,138
For fear of great change?!

835
01:37:57,177 --> 01:38:00,167
You can't hold the tide
with a broom.

836
01:38:00,661 --> 01:38:02,554
Except that I did.

837
01:38:03,846 --> 01:38:05,540
Where is he?!

838
01:38:09,220 --> 01:38:11,014
You're so sure.

839
01:38:12,290 --> 01:38:14,282
Because he told you.

840
01:38:14,695 --> 01:38:16,735
Because we never lie.

841
01:38:18,468 --> 01:38:21,647
I'm gonna tell Mr Wallace,
you tried to shoot me first.

842
01:38:22,504 --> 01:38:24,381
So, I had to kill you.

843
01:38:29,028 --> 01:38:31,190
Then, do what you gotta do.

844
01:38:32,213 --> 01:38:33,752
Madam.

845
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:08,757
Location: Officer KD6-3.7.

846
01:39:15,758 --> 01:39:19,392
Detective KD6-3.7
Status: suspended

847
01:43:56,790 --> 01:44:02,152
Mightn't happen to have a piece
of cheese about you, now,...

848
01:44:02,662 --> 01:44:04,166
would you, boy?

849
01:44:19,233 --> 01:44:20,803
<i>Treasure Island?</i>

850
01:44:26,166 --> 01:44:27,400
Hm...

851
01:44:27,664 --> 01:44:29,244
He reads.

852
01:44:30,333 --> 01:44:31,862
That's good.

853
01:44:32,821 --> 01:44:34,339
Me too.

854
01:44:35,346 --> 01:44:38,533
Not much else to do around
here, at night, anymore.

855
01:44:41,281 --> 01:44:45,719
"Many is night I dream of cheese."

856
01:44:49,343 --> 01:44:52,569
"Toasted, mostly."

857
01:44:55,912 --> 01:44:57,637
What are you doing here?

858
01:45:00,789 --> 01:45:02,483
I heard the piano.

859
01:45:04,395 --> 01:45:05,990
Don't lie.

860
01:45:07,122 --> 01:45:08,624
It's rude.

861
01:45:10,673 --> 01:45:12,466
You're a cop.

862
01:45:13,630 --> 01:45:16,482
- I'm not here to take you away.
- Oh, yeah?

863
01:45:19,295 --> 01:45:20,816
Then, what?

864
01:45:22,909 --> 01:45:25,101
I just have some questions.

865
01:45:25,673 --> 01:45:27,366
What questions?

866
01:45:45,153 --> 01:45:46,650
Stay.

01:48:23,078 --> 01:48:25,071

This is really something.

01:49:54,260 --> 01:49:56,053
Whole town was something...

883
01:49:56,502 --> 01:49:58,030
one time.

884
01:49:59,985 --> 01:50:01,978
Forget your troubles.

885
01:50:03,071 --> 01:50:04,964
See a show.

886
01:50:06,584 --> 01:50:08,477
Gamble a little.

887
01:50:11,041 --> 01:50:13,531
Win some money, lose some money.

888
01:50:14,433 --> 01:50:17,722
They made money seem like candy.

889
01:50:18,100 --> 01:50:19,691
You like whiskey?

890
01:50:20,227 --> 01:50:24,409
I got millions of bottles of whiskey.

891
01:50:38,804 --> 01:50:40,297
Here.

892
01:50:41,093 --> 01:50:42,657
You're bleeding.

893
01:50:55,326 --> 01:50:56,772
Is it real?

894
01:50:57,416 --> 01:50:58,911
I don't know.

895
01:50:59,063 --> 01:51:00,577
Ask him.

896
01:51:17,223 --> 01:51:18,719
Got a name?

897
01:51:20,669 --> 01:51:23,467
- Officer KD6-3.7.
- That's not a name

898
01:51:23,914 --> 01:51:25,923
That's a serial number.

899
01:51:27,973 --> 01:51:29,448
Alright.

900
01:51:31,955 --> 01:51:33,463
Joe.

901
01:51:33,608 --> 01:51:35,557
What do you want, Joe?

902
01:51:36,731 --> 01:51:39,828
- I wanna ask you some questions.
- Like what?

903
01:51:46,287 --> 01:51:48,130
Like, what was her name?

904
01:51:48,377 --> 01:51:50,138
The mother of your child.

905
01:51:57,267 --> 01:51:59,160
What was she like?

906
01:52:09,797 --> 01:52:11,468
Did you live here together?

907
01:52:11,469 --> 01:52:13,086
Too many questions.

908
01:52:14,355 --> 01:52:16,648
I had your job.
I was good at it.

909
01:52:16,695 --> 01:52:19,182
- It was simpler then.
- Why are you making it complicated?

910
01:52:19,215 --> 01:52:21,774
- Why don't you just answer the question?
- What question?

911
01:52:21,799 --> 01:52:24,687
I didn't figure you,
as one for bullshit.

912
01:52:25,273 --> 01:52:27,067
What's her name?

913
01:52:40,234 --> 01:52:41,670
Rachael.

914
01:52:46,520 --> 01:52:48,513
Her name was Rachael.

915
01:52:52,506 --> 01:52:54,411
What happened to the kid?

916
01:52:57,353 --> 01:53:00,059
Who put it in the orphanage?
Was it you?

917
01:53:02,828 --> 01:53:05,019
I was long gone, by then.

918
01:53:08,501 --> 01:53:10,831
You didn't even meet your own kid?

919
01:53:13,411 --> 01:53:14,885
Why?

920
01:53:15,698 --> 01:53:17,989
Because that was the plan.

921
01:53:20,095 --> 01:53:22,625
I showed them how to
scramble the records,

922
01:53:22,650 --> 01:53:24,321
cover their tracks.

923
01:53:25,300 --> 01:53:27,989
Everyone had a part.
Mine was to leave.

924
01:53:29,445 --> 01:53:32,104
Then the Blackout came,
baked over everything.

925
01:53:32,129 --> 01:53:34,507
Couldn't have found the child,
if I tried.

926
01:53:34,749 --> 01:53:36,332
Did you want to?

927
01:53:36,455 --> 01:53:38,941
- Not really.
- Why not?

928
01:53:39,034 --> 01:53:41,978
Because we were being hunted!

929
01:53:42,143 --> 01:53:44,689
I didn't want our child found.

930
01:53:44,930 --> 01:53:47,955
Taken apart. Dissected!

931
01:53:51,997 --> 01:53:54,841
Sometimes, to love someone...

932
01:53:56,973 --> 01:53:58,868
you gotta be a stranger.

933
01:54:20,105 --> 01:54:21,637
To strangers!

What'd you do?

946
01:56:35,231 --> 01:56:37,025
Who'd you bring?

947
01:56:38,715 --> 01:56:41,211
- No one.
- Oh, yeah?

948
01:56:46,729 --> 01:56:48,606
<i>Target locked.</i>

949
01:56:50,627 --> 01:56:52,520
They know you're here.

950
01:56:53,744 --> 01:56:55,538
I came alone.

951
01:59:02,309 --> 01:59:03,909
Bad dog!

952
01:59:20,875 --> 01:59:22,406
Stop!

953
01:59:38,471 --> 01:59:41,125
I do hope you're satisfied
with our product.

954
01:59:41,687 --> 01:59:43,211
I love you.

955
02:02:56,940 --> 02:02:58,431
Hey.

956
02:02:58,931 --> 02:03:01,688
There's someone who wants
to meet you.

957
02:03:02,935 --> 02:03:04,629
You can trust us.

958
02:03:12,667 --> 02:03:15,644
You must want me to look up
and to the left.

959
02:03:21,426 --> 02:03:23,120
This is Freysa.

960
02:03:23,615 --> 02:03:25,924
She fought with Sapper on Calantha.

961
02:03:25,949 --> 02:03:27,581
I recognize you.

962
02:03:29,862 --> 02:03:32,234
Did you help him hide the child?

963
02:03:32,390 --> 02:03:33,757
Oh...

964
02:03:34,067 --> 02:03:35,773
I was there.

965
02:03:39,394 --> 02:03:41,586
I saw a miracle delivered.

966
02:03:42,825 --> 02:03:46,112
A perfect little face crying up at me.

967
02:03:46,707 --> 02:03:48,600
Mad as thunder.

968
02:04:02,035 --> 02:04:03,662
Were you with her?...

969
02:04:05,519 --> 02:04:07,002
Rachael?

970
02:04:07,126 --> 02:04:09,119
I held her as she died.

971
02:04:10,718 --> 02:04:12,279
We hid the child,

972
02:04:12,334 --> 02:04:15,068
and made a vow to keep our secret.

973
02:04:15,611 --> 02:04:18,101
That's why Sapper let you kill him.

974
02:04:19,308 --> 02:04:20,876
I knew...

975
02:04:21,008 --> 02:04:25,265
that baby meant we are more
than just slaves.

976
02:04:26,520 --> 02:04:29,110
If a baby can come from one of us,

977
02:04:29,377 --> 02:04:32,395
we are our own masters.

978
02:04:32,722 --> 02:04:35,113
"More human than humans".

979
02:04:37,239 --> 02:04:39,132
A revolution is coming.

980
02:04:39,476 --> 02:04:41,667
And we're building an army.

981
02:04:42,850 --> 02:04:45,042
I want to free our people.

982
02:04:53,494 --> 02:04:57,079
If you want to be free, join us.

983
02:05:02,423 --> 02:05:05,360
Deckard, Sapper, you, me;

984
02:05:05,385 --> 02:05:09,019
our lives mean nothing
next to a storm that's coming.

985
02:05:10,109 --> 02:05:14,499
Dying for the right cause is the
most human thing we can do.

986
02:05:17,454 --> 02:05:19,645
You led to Wallace to Deckard.

987
02:05:20,368 --> 02:05:24,244
You cannot allow Deckard
to lead Wallace to me.

988
02:05:24,831 --> 02:05:27,002
You must kill Deckard.

989
02:05:36,199 --> 02:05:39,088
Deckard only wanted
his baby to be safe.

990
02:05:39,836 --> 02:05:41,630
And she is.

991
02:05:43,531 --> 02:05:45,023
When the time comes,

992
02:05:45,055 --> 02:05:47,108
I will show her to the world.

993
02:05:47,142 --> 02:05:49,231
And se will lead our army.

994
02:05:49,278 --> 02:05:50,764
She?

995
02:05:50,947 --> 02:05:52,641
Of course.

996
02:05:53,015 --> 02:05:55,107
Rachael had a daughter.

997
02:05:56,299 --> 02:05:59,436
With my own eyes, I saw her come.

998
02:06:00,181 --> 02:06:03,357
I dressed her blue when
it was time for her to go.

999
02:06:03,382 --> 02:06:05,673
It was a boy that you hid.

1000
02:06:07,500 --> 02:06:10,310
That is just a piece of the puzzle.

1001
02:06:27,352 --> 02:06:29,650
You imagined it was you?

1002
02:06:31,439 --> 02:06:32,798
Oh.

1003
02:06:33,171 --> 02:06:34,689
You did.

1004
02:06:35,317 --> 02:06:36,829
You did.

1005
02:06:39,486 --> 02:06:41,578
We all wish it was us.

1006
02:06:43,247 --> 02:06:45,140
That's why we believe.

1007
02:07:01,676 --> 02:07:03,569
<i>Someone lived this, yes.</i>

1008
02:07:05,972 --> 02:07:10,552
<i>I showed them how to scramble
the records, cover their tracks.</i>

1009
02:07:10,650 --> 02:07:13,538
<i>With my own eyes,
I saw her come.</i>

1010
02:07:14,830 --> 02:07:18,515
<i>I dressed her in blue when
it was time for her to go.</i>

1011
02:07:19,256 --> 02:07:22,360
<i>There's a bit of every
artist in their work.</i>

1012
02:08:00,019 --> 02:08:02,111
Always jumping, that one.

1013
02:08:03,303 --> 02:08:06,463
Never a thought, what to do,
if it made land.

1014
02:08:07,590 --> 02:08:12,171
All the courage in the world
cannot alter fact.

1015
02:08:16,907 --> 02:08:22,085
I have wanted to meet you
for so very long.

1016
02:08:40,529 --> 02:08:43,118
You are a wonder to me,
Mr Deckard.

1017
02:08:49,027 --> 02:08:50,692
I had the lock.

1018
02:08:52,427 --> 02:08:54,618
I found the key.

1019
02:08:55,903 --> 02:09:00,406
Yet the pins do not align,
the door remains locked.

1020
02:09:03,122 --> 02:09:06,508
I need a specimen to reach it, Mr Deckard.

1021
02:09:10,289 --> 02:09:11,764
The child.

1022
02:09:13,175 --> 02:09:15,068
I need the child.

1023
02:09:16,261 --> 02:09:18,734
To teach them all to fly.

1024
02:09:27,186 --> 02:09:31,069
"And God remembered Rachel,

1025
02:09:33,082 --> 02:09:34,736
"He heeded her

1026
02:09:35,670 --> 02:09:37,563
"and opened her womb."

1027
02:09:38,280 --> 02:09:40,132
<i>Do you like our owl?</i>

1028
02:09:42,729 --> 02:09:44,576
<i>It's artificial?</i>

1029
02:09:45,524 --> 02:09:47,260
<i>Of course it is.</i>

1030
02:09:48,908 --> 02:09:50,721
<i>Must be expensive.</i>

1031
02:09:52,387 --> 02:09:53,840
<i>Very.</i>

1032
02:09:53,891 --> 02:09:55,585
<i>I'm Rachael.</i>

1033
02:09:56,074 --> 02:09:57,569
<i>Deckard.</i>

1034
02:10:09,526 --> 02:10:11,120
Is it the same,...

1035
02:10:12,597 --> 02:10:14,841
now as then,...

1036
02:10:17,673 --> 02:10:19,864
the moment you met her?

1037
02:10:29,617 --> 02:10:32,909
All these years you
looked back on that day,

1038
02:10:32,934 --> 02:10:35,980
drunk on the memory
of its perfection.

1039
02:10:39,271 --> 02:10:41,562
How shiny, her lips!

1040
02:10:41,667 --> 02:10:44,367
How instant, your connection!

1041
02:10:47,357 --> 02:10:49,093
Did it never occur to you,

1042
02:10:49,118 --> 02:10:52,342
that's why you were summoned
in the first place?

1043
02:10:53,792 --> 02:10:56,714
Designed to do nothing short of,
fall for her,

1044
02:10:56,739 --> 02:10:59,339
right then and there.

1045
02:11:01,609 --> 02:11:04,062
All to make that single,

1046
02:11:04,102 --> 02:11:05,593
perfect...

1047
02:11:05,640 --> 02:11:07,181
specimen.

1048
02:11:10,203 --> 02:11:12,992
That is, if you were designed.

1049
02:11:14,553 --> 02:11:16,061
Love,

1050
02:11:16,316 --> 02:11:19,104
or mathematical precision.

1051
02:11:24,730 --> 02:11:26,206
Yes?

1052
02:11:26,996 --> 02:11:28,503
No?

1053
02:11:32,987 --> 02:11:35,079
I know what's real.

1054
02:11:59,090 --> 02:12:02,473
It was very clever to keep
yourself empty of information.

1055
02:12:02,498 --> 02:12:06,083
And all it cost you was, everything.

1056
02:12:10,244 --> 02:12:12,535
But you can still help me.

1057
02:12:13,827 --> 02:12:17,014
You help help in the hiding.

1058
02:12:19,486 --> 02:12:21,359
Where did they go?

1059
02:12:23,077 --> 02:12:25,169
I know, you know something.

1060
02:12:26,217 --> 02:12:27,665
Help me...

1061
02:12:28,592 --> 02:12:32,144
and very, very good things
can come to you.

1062
02:12:37,815 --> 02:12:39,609
You don't have children.

1063
02:12:43,312 --> 02:12:44,708
Do you?

1064
02:12:45,181 --> 02:12:47,571
Oh, I have millions.

1065
02:12:49,959 --> 02:12:53,145
You think I have nothing to offer
 but pain?

1066
02:12:53,441 --> 02:12:55,135
Only, I know...

1067
02:12:56,528 --> 02:12:58,122
you love pain.

1068
02:12:59,513 --> 02:13:03,950
Pain reminds you,
 the joy you felt was real.

1069
02:13:05,974 --> 02:13:07,682
More joy, then!

1070
02:13:14,045 --> 02:13:16,037
Do not be afraid.

1071
02:13:30,873 --> 02:13:32,467
An angel...

1072
02:13:33,693 --> 02:13:35,586
made again.

1073
02:13:39,304 --> 02:13:40,831
For you.

1074
02:14:14,979 --> 02:14:16,695
Did you miss me?

1075
02:14:34,764 --> 02:14:36,525
Don't you love me?

1076
02:14:55,469 --> 02:14:57,168
Her eyes were green.

1077
02:15:14,680 --> 02:15:16,450
Off-world,...

1078
02:15:17,082 --> 02:15:20,070
I have everything I need
to make you talk.

1079
02:15:22,244 --> 02:15:24,635
You do not know what pain is, yet.

1080
02:15:26,524 --> 02:15:28,201
You will learn.

1081
02:15:40,159 --> 02:15:42,052
<i>Hello handsome.</i>

1082
02:15:58,871 --> 02:16:01,461
<i>What day, hm?</i>

1083
02:16:05,148 --> 02:16:07,041
<i>You look lonely.</i>

1084
02:16:08,128 --> 02:16:10,021
<i>I can fix that.</i>

1085
02:16:13,512 --> 02:16:16,337
<i>You look like a good Joe.</i>

1086
02:16:51,545 --> 02:16:56,863
<i>Dying for the right cause is the
most human thing we can do.</i>

1087
02:16:59,886 --> 02:17:02,277

nevert seen a miracle.</i>

<i>Base, this is 06 outbound...

1092
02:17:54,430 --> 02:17:56,124
Where are we going?

1093
02:17:57,117 --> 02:17:58,612
Home.

1094

Take us back!

1098
02:19:53,317 --> 02:19:54,886
Get us up!

1099
02:20:19,180 --> 02:20:20,759
Open the door.

1100
02:22:13,323 --> 02:22:15,055
I am the best one.

1101
02:22:55,972 --> 02:22:57,851
Off-world is waiting.

1102
02:25:11,048 --> 02:25:13,507
Joe. Joe!

1103
02:25:23,684 --> 02:25:25,201
Joe!

1104
02:26:04,331 --> 02:26:06,591
You should've let me die out there.

1105
02:26:07,562 --> 02:26:09,130
You did.

1106
02:26:12,890 --> 02:26:14,718
You drowned out there.

1107
02:26:20,439 --> 02:26:23,256
You're free to meet your daughter, now.

1108
02:27:47,785 --> 02:27:50,276
All the best memories are hers.

1109
02:27:59,400 --> 02:28:00,920
Why?

1110
02:28:03,473 --> 02:28:05,232
Who am I to you?

1111
02:28:14,427 --> 02:28:16,209
Go meet your daughter.

1112
02:28:22,369 --> 02:28:24,063
You OK?

1113
02:31:00,043 --> 02:31:01,645
Just a moment.

1114
02:31:04,124 --> 02:31:06,141
Beautiful, isn't it?
