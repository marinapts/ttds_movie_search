Diving the deep

1080
01:31:50,255 --> 01:31:53,399
Stars are shining bright

1081
01:31:53,925 --> 01:31:57,528
The wind is on the rise

1082
01:31:57,804 --> 01:32:00,864
Whispering words

1083
01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:04,284
Of long-lost lullabies

1084
01:32:04,436 --> 01:32:08,163
Oh, won't you come with me?

1085
01:32:08,815 --> 01:32:11,875
Where the moon is made of gold

1086
01:32:11,985 --> 01:32:16,046
And in the morning sun

1087
01:32:16,448 --> 01:32:19,091
We'll be sailing

1088
01:32:19,451 --> 01:32:23,220
Oh, won't you come with me?

1089
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:26,900
Where the ocean meets the sky

1090
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:31,196
And as the clouds roll by

1091
01:32:31,296 --> 01:32:34,898
We'll sing the song of the sea

1092
01:32:35,258 --> 01:32:38,235
I had a dream last night

1093
01:32:38,929 --> 01:32:42,239
And heard the sweetest sound

1094
01:32:42,641 --> 01:32:45,826
I saw a great white light

1095
01:32:46,436 --> 01:32:49,705
And dancers in the round

1096
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:53,500
Castles in the sand

1097
01:32:54,194 --> 01:32:57,087
Cradles in the trees

1098
01:32:57,989 --> 01:33:02,760
Don't cry
I'll see you by and by

1099
01:33:04,496 --> 01:33:08,098
Oh, won't you come with me?

1100
01:33:08,875 --> 01:33:11,945
Where the moon is made of gold

1101
01:33:12,045 --> 01:33:15,773
And in the morning sun

1102
01:33:16,675 --> 01:33:19,234
We'll be sailing

1103
01:33:19,386 --> 01:33:23,280
Oh, won't you come with me?

1104
01:33:23,848 --> 01:33:26,825
Where the ocean meets the sky

1105
01:33:26,977 --> 01:33:31,080
And as the clouds roll by

1106
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:36,085
We'll sing the song of the sea
