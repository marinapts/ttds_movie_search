00:01:57,834 --> 00:01:59,456
<i>Dear Friend...</i>

4
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:04,371
<i>I am writing to you because
she said you listen and understand...</i>

5
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:07,424
<i>...and didn't try to sleep with
that person at that party...</i>

6
00:02:07,425 --> 00:02:08,956
<i>...even though you could have.</i>

7
00:02:09,488 --> 00:02:12,012
<i>Please don't try to
figure out who I am...</i>

8
00:02:12,013 --> 00:02:13,890
<i>...I don't want you to do that.</i>

9
00:02:14,686 --> 00:02:16,974
<i>I just need to know that
people like you exist.</i>

10
00:02:17,451 --> 00:02:20,798
<i>Like if you met me,
you wouldn't think I was...</i>

11
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:24,144
<i>...the weird kid who spent
time in the hospital.</i>

12
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:28,701
<i>And I wouldn't make you nervous.</i>

13
00:02:30,096 --> 00:02:32,579
<i>I hope it's okay for me to think that.</i>

14
00:02:33,499 --> 00:02:38,244
<i>You see, I haven't really talked to
anyone outside of my family all summer.</i>

15
00:02:38,273 --> 00:02:41,430
<i>But tomorrow is my first
day of high school ever...</i>

16
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:43,577
<i>...and I need to turn things around.</i>

17
00:02:44,249 --> 00:02:46,508
<i>So, I have a plan.</i>

18
00:02:47,143 --> 00:02:48,858
<i>As I enter the school for the first time...</i>

19
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:53,758
<i>...I will visualize what it will be like on
the last day of my senior year.</i>

20
00:02:54,121 --> 00:02:56,611
<i>Unfortunately, I counted, and that's...</i>

21
00:02:57,191 --> 00:02:59,744
Hop, freshman toads.
Hop! Let's move it, boys!

22
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:03,042
<i>...1385 days from now.</i>

23
00:03:03,077 --> 00:03:05,524
Worked out all summer.
Rock hard.

24
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:07,374
You know,
Why don't you guys get a room?

25
00:03:07,653 --> 00:03:11,698
<i>Just 1385 days.</i>

26
00:03:12,494 --> 00:03:16,225
<i>In the meantime, I'd hoped that my
sister Candace and her boyfriend Derek...</i>

27
00:03:16,226 --> 00:03:18,489
<i>...would have let me eat
lunch with their Earth Club.</i>

28
00:03:18,524 --> 00:03:19,632
Seniors only.

29
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:23,355
What are you doing
with that plastic spork?

30
00:03:23,356 --> 00:03:25,158
I don't want to bring back silverware.

31
00:03:25,544 --> 00:03:29,447
Derek, you're Earth Club Treasurer.
Come on.

32
00:03:29,917 --> 00:03:31,778
<i>When my sister said no...</i>

33
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:35,676
<i>...I thought maybe my old friend Susan
would want to have lunch with me.</i>

34
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,944
<i>In middle school, Susan
was very fun to be around, but...</i>

35
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:43,251
<i>...now she doesn't like
to say hi to me anymore.</i>

36
00:03:43,914 --> 00:03:45,266
<i>And then there's Brad Hays.</i>

37
00:03:45,301 --> 00:03:48,412
<i>Before my brother went to
play football for Penn State...</i>

38
00:03:48,447 --> 00:03:49,962
<i>...he and Brad played together.</i>

39
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:52,759
<i>So, I thought maybe he'd say hi to me.</i>

40
00:03:52,794 --> 00:03:57,110
<i>But Brad's a senior and I'm me,
so, who am I kidding?</i>

41
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,756
<i>On the bright side,
one senior decided to...</i>

42
00:03:59,757 --> 00:04:02,598
<i>...make fun of the teacher
instead of the freshmen.</i>

43
00:04:03,026 --> 00:04:07,387
<i>He even drew on Mr. Callahan's
legendary goatee with a grease pencil.</i>

44
00:04:10,455 --> 00:04:13,208
The prick punch is not a toy.

45
00:04:13,243 --> 00:04:16,137
I learned that back in 'Nam in '68.

46
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,888
"Callahan," the sergeant said...

47
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:21,106
..."you put down that prick
punch, you go kill some gooks."

48
00:04:21,141 --> 00:04:22,276
And you know what happened?

49
00:04:22,311 --> 00:04:26,255
That prick punch killed my best friend
in a Saigon whorehouse.

50
00:04:26,903 --> 00:04:28,971
I heard you were gonna be in my class.

51
00:04:30,048 --> 00:04:33,979
Are you proud to be a senior having to
take freshman shop, Patty-Cakes?

52
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:36,300
Look. My name is Patrick.

53
00:04:36,335 --> 00:04:38,618
Either you call me Patrick
or you call me nothing.

54
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,803
Okay, Nothing.

55
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:44,521
<i>I felt really bad for Patrick.</i>

56
00:04:44,556 --> 00:04:47,887
<i>He wasn't saying the impersonation
to be mean or anything.</i>

57
00:04:48,528 --> 00:04:51,128
<i>He was just trying to make us
freshmen feel better.</i>

58
00:04:51,531 --> 00:04:54,457
Nothing, why don't you read first?

59
00:04:54,648 --> 00:04:56,638
Alright. Chapter 1.

60
00:04:57,087 --> 00:05:01,034
Surviving your fascist shop teacher,
who needs to put kids down to feel big.

61
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:03,096
Oh, wow. This is useful guys.
We should read on.

62
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,277
<i>My last class of the
day is advanced English...</i>

63
00:05:07,622 --> 00:05:11,407
<i>...and I'm really excited to finally learn
with the smartest kids in the school.</i>

64
00:05:12,435 --> 00:05:15,312
Nice Trapper Keeper, faggot.

65
00:05:15,313 --> 00:05:18,432
<i>Believe it or not she's gotten
straight A since kindergarten.</i>

66
00:05:22,163 --> 00:05:23,371
I'm Mr. Anderson.

67
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,800
I'm going to be your
teacher for freshman English.

68
00:05:25,835 --> 00:05:28,975
This semester, we're going to be learning
Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird.

69
00:05:29,185 --> 00:05:30,261
Genius book.

70
00:05:30,637 --> 00:05:33,690
Now, who'd like to get out
of the first pop quiz?

71
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:35,671
I'm shocked.

72
00:05:35,706 --> 00:05:37,710
Alright.
Well, you can skip the quiz...

73
00:05:37,745 --> 00:05:40,803
...if you tell me which author
invented the paperback book.

74
00:05:41,016 --> 00:05:42,030
Anyone?

75
00:05:42,662 --> 00:05:43,678
He was British.

76
00:05:44,248 --> 00:05:45,959
He also invented the serial.

77
00:05:46,272 --> 00:05:50,651
In fact, at the end of
the third chapter of his first novel...

78
00:05:50,806 --> 00:05:54,880
...he had a man hanging
from a cliff by his fingernails.

79
00:05:54,915 --> 00:05:56,907
Hence, the term cliffhanger.

80
00:05:58,167 --> 00:05:59,413
Anybody?

81
00:05:59,448 --> 00:06:01,420
- Yeah.
- Shakespeare.

82
00:06:01,691 --> 00:06:04,565
That's a great guess, but no,
Shakespeare didn't write novels.

83
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:07,011
Anybody else?

84
00:06:09,532 --> 00:06:10,899
The author...

85
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,016
...is Charles Dickens.

86
00:06:17,728 --> 00:06:19,912
However, if you and I
had gone to a Shakespeare play...

87
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:21,772
...it would have cost us 4 pennies.

88
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:23,252
Can you imagine that?

89
00:06:23,253 --> 00:06:25,518
We would have put those
pennies in a metal box...

90
00:06:25,692 --> 00:06:27,596
...the ushers would lock in the office.

91
00:06:27,631 --> 00:06:29,500
And that's where we get the term...

92
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:30,726
Cash register.

93
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:36,297
I'll give you a free "A" on anything till
the final term paper if you get it right.

94
00:06:41,593 --> 00:06:43,033
Box office.

95
00:06:45,016 --> 00:06:46,661
You should learn to participate.

96
00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:51,995
Why didn't you raise your hand?

97
00:06:54,943 --> 00:06:56,560
They call you teacher's pet?

98
00:06:57,163 --> 00:06:58,864
Freak? That kind of things?

99
00:06:59,398 --> 00:07:02,501
I used to get spaz.
I mean, come on, spaz?

100
00:07:06,864 --> 00:07:09,040
You know, I heard
you had a tough time last year.

101
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,204
But they say if you make...

102
00:07:11,744 --> 00:07:14,166
...one friend on your first day,
you're doing okay.

103
00:07:14,698 --> 00:07:15,398
Thank you, sir.

104
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:18,197
But if my English teacher is
the only friend I make today...

105
00:07:18,198 --> 00:07:20,583
...that would be sort of depressing.

106
00:07:20,618 --> 00:07:22,917
Yeah. I could see that.

107
00:07:22,931 --> 00:07:25,117
Don't worry, Mr. Anderson.
I'm okay.

108
00:07:26,068 --> 00:07:26,832
Thanks.

109
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:35,499
I would happily not take shop...

110
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,287
Hey, Freshman Toad.

111
00:07:38,882 --> 00:07:43,821
<i>Well, I have 1384 days to go.</i>

112
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,103
<i>Just so I say it to someone...</i>

113
00:07:47,104 --> 00:07:50,867
<i>...high school is even
worse than middle school.</i>

114
00:07:52,418 --> 00:07:56,122
<i>If my parents ask me about it,
I probably won't tell them the truth...</i>

115
00:07:56,157 --> 00:08:00,355
<i>...because I don't want them to
worry that I might get bad again.</i>

116
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,499
<i>If my Aunt Helen were still here,
I could talk to her.</i>

117
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:07,574
<i>And I know she would understand
how I am both happy and sad...</i>

118
00:08:07,575 --> 00:08:10,747
<i>...and I'm still trying to
figure out how that could be.</i>

119
00:08:11,262 --> 00:08:13,338
<i>I just hope I make a friend soon.</i>

120
00:08:14,212 --> 00:08:16,510
<i>Love always, Charlie.</i>

121
00:08:17,793 --> 00:08:19,260
Charlie, come on.

122
00:08:21,498 --> 00:08:23,824
This chicken paprikash is delicious.

123
00:08:23,859 --> 00:08:25,917
Thank you, Derek.
It's Charlie's favorite.

124
00:08:25,952 --> 00:08:28,061
He was a little nervous about
starting high school today...

125
00:08:28,096 --> 00:08:29,397
...so I made it for him.

126
00:08:29,725 --> 00:08:32,144
You feel a little silly about
being nervous now, huh, champ?

127
00:08:32,676 --> 00:08:34,550
Yes, sir. I do

128
00:08:34,891 --> 00:08:35,602
I told you.

129
00:08:36,118 --> 00:08:38,189
Just give 'em a smile and be yourself.

130
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:41,017
- That's how you...
- "...make friends in the real world."

131
00:08:41,052 --> 00:08:42,606
You're cruisin' for a bruisin'

132
00:08:42,641 --> 00:08:44,792
Freshman year is tough, but...

133
00:08:45,551 --> 00:08:46,943
...you really find yourself.

134
00:08:52,202 --> 00:08:53,586
Thanks, Derek.

135
00:08:53,993 --> 00:08:56,497
You know, you could be
a little nicer to Derek.

136
00:08:56,532 --> 00:08:59,002
I'm sorry. The kid's a pussy.
I can't stand him.

137
00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:02,594
- I really hope you love the mix tape I made.
- I do.

138
00:09:03,003 --> 00:09:05,306
- The cover is hand-painted.
- Oh. Wow.

139
00:09:10,387 --> 00:09:12,149
Hey, Charlie, you want this?

140
00:09:12,907 --> 00:09:14,459
Are you sure?

141
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,259
He gives me one every week.

142
00:09:20,302 --> 00:09:23,276
<i>Hey, Babe.
This next one might be a little sad...</i>

143
00:09:23,311 --> 00:09:25,351
<i>...but it reminded me of your eyes.</i>

144
00:09:44,754 --> 00:09:47,763
Did you already do the term paper
on To Kill a Mockingbird?

145
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,985
Let's go, Devils!

146
00:11:06,546 --> 00:11:07,546
Come on.

147
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,528
- Hey, Nothing.
- Hey, Nothing.

148
00:11:09,563 --> 00:11:11,298
Oh, suck it, virginity pledges!

149
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,362
Suck it!

150
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,795
Hey, Patrick.

151
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,366
Hey! You're in my shop class, right?

152
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:36,017
How's your clock coming?

153
00:11:36,052 --> 00:11:37,836
My dad's building it for me.

154
00:11:37,837 --> 00:11:40,423
Yeah. Mine looks like a boat.

155
00:11:40,847 --> 00:11:43,096
You wanna sit over here,
or are you waiting for your friends?

156
00:11:43,131 --> 00:11:44,334
Oh, no, no, I'll sit.

157
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:49,836
Thanks for not calling
me "Nothing" by the way.

158
00:11:49,871 --> 00:11:51,125
It's an endless nightmare.

159
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,456
And these assholes,
they actually think they're being original.

160
00:11:55,857 --> 00:11:59,136
- So, uh... do you like football?
- Love it. Love football.

161
00:11:59,171 --> 00:12:00,453
Maybe you know my brother, then.

162
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:01,691
Hey, Sam.

163
00:12:02,207 --> 00:12:05,282
Question. Could the bathrooms here
be more disgusting?

164
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:08,284
Yes, they call it the men's room.

165
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,259
So, I finally got hold of Bob.

166
00:12:11,294 --> 00:12:12,717
Party tonight?

167
00:12:13,421 --> 00:12:16,528
He's still trying to shag that
waitress from the Olive Garden.

168
00:12:16,563 --> 00:12:18,690
Oh, he's never tossing that salad.

169
00:12:21,618 --> 00:12:22,868
Come on!

170
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:26,609
Patrick!

171
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,850
- Yeah.
- Who's this?

172
00:12:28,851 --> 00:12:30,736
This is...

173
00:12:30,737 --> 00:12:34,823
- Charlie... Kelmeckis.
- Kelmeckis! No shit!

174
00:12:34,858 --> 00:12:37,139
- Your sister's dating Pony Tail Derek, isn't she?
- God!

175
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:38,555
Is that what they call him?

176
00:12:38,556 --> 00:12:40,551
Would you leave Pony Tail Derek alone?

177
00:12:40,704 --> 00:12:42,727
You put the "ass" in "class," Patrick.

178
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,404
I try, Sam. I try.

179
00:12:44,947 --> 00:12:46,837
It's nice to meet you, Charlie.
I'm Sam.

180
00:12:47,859 --> 00:12:50,471
So, Sam, what's the plan?
Are we going to Mary Elizabeth's tonight?

181
00:12:50,472 --> 00:12:54,265
Nope. She got caught watering down
her parent's brandy with iced tea.

182
00:12:54,266 --> 00:12:55,547
Let's just go to Kings.

183
00:12:55,548 --> 00:12:58,406
Alright. We're going to Kings
after the game if you wanna come.

184
00:13:17,944 --> 00:13:19,499
Do you have a favorite band?

185
00:13:19,534 --> 00:13:22,354
Well, I think The Smiths are my favorite.

186
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:24,787
Are you kidding?
I love The Smiths!

187
00:13:24,822 --> 00:13:27,429
The best breakup band ever.
What's your favorite song?

188
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,878
Asleep.
It's from Louder Than Bombs.

189
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:32,612
I heard it on Pony
Tail Derek's mix tape.

190
00:13:32,647 --> 00:13:34,326
Oh, that works on so many levels.

191
00:13:34,361 --> 00:13:36,166
I can make you guys a copy if you want.

192
00:13:36,201 --> 00:13:37,971
What about Eide's?
You love Eide's, right?

193
00:13:38,006 --> 00:13:39,802
Yeah, of course.
They're great.

194
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,417
Not a band, Charlie.

195
00:13:41,452 --> 00:13:43,258
It's a record store downtown.

196
00:13:43,293 --> 00:13:44,957
I think it sounds
so much better on the Vinyl.

197
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,785
You know, I used to be popular
before Sam got me some good music.

198
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,767
So, you should be careful.
She'll ruin your life forever.

199
00:13:50,895 --> 00:13:51,950
That's okay.

200
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:54,203
- Hey, Nothing.
- Hey, Nothing.

201
00:13:54,216 --> 00:13:58,287
Let it go! Jesus!
It's an antique joke!

202
00:13:58,541 --> 00:13:59,576
It's over!

203
00:13:59,818 --> 00:14:01,779
So, what are you gonna do
when you get out of this place?

204
00:14:01,814 --> 00:14:04,258
Well, My Aunt Helen said
I should be a writer, but..

205
00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:07,211
I don't know what I'd write about.

206
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:09,103
- You could write about us.
- Yeah.

207
00:14:09,553 --> 00:14:11,779
Call it Slut and The Falcon.

208
00:14:12,012 --> 00:14:13,441
Make us solve crimes.

209
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,794
You guys seem really happy together.

210
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:17,757
How long have you been
boyfriend and girlfriend?

211
00:14:20,332 --> 00:14:23,538
He's not my boyfriend.
He's my step-brother.

212
00:14:23,539 --> 00:14:28,235
My mom finally left my worthless dad and
married his nice dad when we moved here.

213
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,629
But She's not bitter or anything.
Make no mistake.

214
00:14:30,664 --> 00:14:31,856
Absolutely not.

215
00:14:31,891 --> 00:14:35,713
Charlie, I'm not a bulimic.
I'm a bulim-ist.

216
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,912
I'm... I'm sorry.
I don't know what that is.

217
00:14:37,947 --> 00:14:39,849
She just really believes in bulimia.

218
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,634
I love bulimia.

219
00:14:46,982 --> 00:14:48,606
Hey, thanks for paying, Charlie.

220
00:14:48,641 --> 00:14:50,701
Oh, no problem.
Thank you guys for the ride.

221
00:14:50,702 --> 00:14:52,715
Maybe I'll see you around in school?

222
00:14:53,223 --> 00:14:55,427
God, would you turn that down?
You're gonna make us deaf.

223
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:57,359
So be it!
It's Rock and roll.

224
00:14:58,444 --> 00:15:00,632
- Bye, Charlie.
- Bye, Charlie.

225
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:02,055
Okay. Bye.

226
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:15,733
<i>Your mom says Don't go
to Columbia with Candace.</i>

227
00:15:15,734 --> 00:15:17,158
- Don't go to Columbia...
- Shut...

228
00:15:17,582 --> 00:15:19,413
<i>Do you always want to
be a mama's boy, Derek?</i>

229
00:15:19,582 --> 00:15:21,117
- I am not a mama's boy.
- Yes, you are!

230
00:15:21,152 --> 00:15:24,125
Because Every single time I go to
your house, every single time...

231
00:15:24,126 --> 00:15:25,388
Shut up, Candace!

232
00:15:25,423 --> 00:15:28,333
...and you stand there
like a little beach...

233
00:15:29,573 --> 00:15:32,333
Charlie, Charlie, just go.
I can handle it.

234
00:15:32,368 --> 00:15:34,471
Just don't wake up mom and dad.

235
00:16:03,152 --> 00:16:05,576
<i>Hey, look who's here.</i>

236
00:16:06,611 --> 00:16:08,119
Welcome home, Aunt Helen!

237
00:16:08,154 --> 00:16:12,891
Oh. Look at you guys,
dressed so nice.

238
00:16:21,611 --> 00:16:22,555
Candace...

239
00:16:24,552 --> 00:16:26,204
...what are you doing?

240
00:16:28,122 --> 00:16:29,705
Look, I egged him on.

241
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:33,122
You saw it.
He's never hit me before.

242
00:16:33,157 --> 00:16:36,314
And I promise you he'll
never hit me again.

243
00:16:36,349 --> 00:16:38,969
Like Aunt Helen's boyfriends?

244
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:44,892
Charlie, this is Pony Tail Derek.

245
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,553
I can handle him.

246
00:16:49,658 --> 00:16:51,205
Do you trust me?

247
00:16:54,365 --> 00:16:56,144
Please, don't tell mom and dad.

248
00:17:36,999 --> 00:17:39,505
Oh, my God.
They're playing good music.

249
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,234
Holy shit. Holy shit.
They are! They're playing good music.

250
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,329
Living room routine?

251
00:17:43,552 --> 00:17:45,538
Living room routine!

252
00:17:46,057 --> 00:17:46,997
- Yes!
- I'm sorry.

253
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,608
- Excuse us! Excuse me!
- I'm sorry!

254
00:17:48,643 --> 00:17:49,528
- Pardon me.
- Sorry.

255
00:17:50,092 --> 00:17:52,631
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

256
00:19:25,024 --> 00:19:26,077
God, it's freezing.

257
00:19:26,112 --> 00:19:27,877
Ho, but you wore that toasty costume.

258
00:19:27,912 --> 00:19:30,399
It's not like it's cute or original
you'd hope it'd be warm.

259
00:19:30,632 --> 00:19:32,901
Yeah, piss off, Tennessee Tuxedo.

260
00:19:32,902 --> 00:19:34,450
Are you sure it's okay that I come?

261
00:19:34,485 --> 00:19:36,773
Yeah, of course.
Just remember, Charlie...

262
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:39,061
- Bob's not paranoid.
- "He's sensitive."

263
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:40,479
Sam...

264
00:19:40,794 --> 00:19:44,642
...that waitress from the Olive Garden,
she was such a tease.

265
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:46,566
Will you marry me?

266
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:49,440
- Only with Patrick's blessing.
- Patrick?

267
00:19:49,475 --> 00:19:52,709
You're a hopeless stoner who
attends the culinary institute.

268
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,593
So, I'm gonna have to say
"no" on that, but nice try.

269
00:19:54,628 --> 00:19:57,160
- Charlie?
- Oh, touch.

270
00:20:05,392 --> 00:20:09,976
So, Charlie... this is a party.

271
00:20:18,631 --> 00:20:20,333
This is what fun looks like.

272
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:24,205
Are you ready to meet
some desperate women?

273
00:20:24,553 --> 00:20:25,643
Here, have a seat.

274
00:20:26,095 --> 00:20:29,113
Hey, ladies, meet Charlie.

275
00:20:30,811 --> 00:20:32,709
- Hi.
- Meet ladies.

276
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:33,446
Hey.

277
00:20:33,481 --> 00:20:34,741
- Mary Elizabeth.
- Alice.

278
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:35,839
Nice to meet you.

279
00:20:35,874 --> 00:20:37,314
This is Charlie's first party ever.

280
00:20:37,349 --> 00:20:42,325
So, I expect nice, meaningful, heartfelt
blow jobs from both of you.

281
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,542
- Patrick, you're such a dick.
- Where the hell did you go?

282
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,768
The dance was a little boring,
don't you think?

283
00:20:46,803 --> 00:20:48,959
You're so selfish.
We looked everywhere for you.

284
00:20:48,994 --> 00:20:50,148
You could have told someone.

285
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:51,805
Cry me a river.

286
00:20:51,806 --> 00:20:54,759
How is it that you've got meaner
since becoming a Buddhist.

287
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,056
Just lucky I guess.

288
00:20:56,091 --> 00:20:58,043
No, you're doing
something wrong, I think.

289
00:20:58,078 --> 00:20:59,995
- Or something very right.
- Yeah, well...

290
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,017
Hey!

291
00:21:01,586 --> 00:21:03,071
Look who's here!

292
00:21:05,155 --> 00:21:06,484
Is that Brad Hays?

293
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:08,212
Yeah. He comes here sometimes.

294
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:10,315
But he's a popular kid.

295
00:21:10,793 --> 00:21:11,782
Then, what are we?

296
00:21:13,153 --> 00:21:16,643
Oh, Charlie, you look like
you could use a brownie.

297
00:21:17,219 --> 00:21:18,676
Thank you.

298
00:21:18,818 --> 00:21:22,433
I was so hungry at the dance.
I was gonna go to King's...

299
00:21:22,468 --> 00:21:24,004
...but I didn't really have any time.

300
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,522
Thanks.

301
00:21:39,177 --> 00:21:41,354
Have you guys felt this carpet?

302
00:21:41,355 --> 00:21:43,671
This carpet feels so darn good.

303
00:21:49,801 --> 00:21:52,483
Charlie. Charlie, what do you
think about high school?

304
00:21:52,518 --> 00:21:53,541
High school?

305
00:21:54,277 --> 00:21:55,303
Bullshit.

306
00:21:56,592 --> 00:21:58,549
Cafeteria is called the Nutrition Center.

307
00:21:58,584 --> 00:22:02,020
People wear their letter jackets
even when it's 98 degrees out.

308
00:22:02,055 --> 00:22:05,214
And why do they give out
letter jackets for marching band?

309
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:08,961
It's not a sport, we all know it.

310
00:22:09,171 --> 00:22:10,733
This kid is crazy.

311
00:22:11,703 --> 00:22:14,462
Mary Elizabeth, I think you're really
gonna regret that, you know...

312
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:18,090
...haircut when you
look back at old photographs.

313
00:22:20,325 --> 00:22:22,690
I'm really sorry.
It sounded like a compliment in my head.

314
00:22:22,725 --> 00:22:24,419
- God!
- Well, it's kind of true.

315
00:22:24,454 --> 00:22:25,826
Shut up!

316
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,831
Bob, did you get him stoned?

317
00:22:29,866 --> 00:22:32,462
Come on, Sam.
He likes it. Just look at him.

318
00:22:33,007 --> 00:22:34,841
How do you feel, Charlie?

319
00:22:36,326 --> 00:22:37,826
I just really want a milkshake.

320
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,076
Sam...

321
00:22:50,754 --> 00:22:53,704
...you have such pretty brown eyes.

322
00:22:53,794 --> 00:22:56,546
The kind of pretty that deserves
to make a big deal about itself.

323
00:22:56,581 --> 00:22:57,541
You know what I mean?

324
00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:03,255
Okay, Charlie.
Let me make the milkshake.

325
00:23:04,035 --> 00:23:06,907
What a great word. Milkshake.

326
00:23:06,942 --> 00:23:10,996
It's like when you say your name
over and over again in the mirror...

327
00:23:11,031 --> 00:23:12,846
...and after awhile, it sounds crazy.

328
00:23:13,288 --> 00:23:15,608
So, I'm guessing
you've never been high before?

329
00:23:15,643 --> 00:23:17,375
No. No, no, no.

330
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:20,894
My best friend Michael.
His dad was a big drinker.

331
00:23:20,929 --> 00:23:23,481
So, he hated all that stuff.

332
00:23:23,796 --> 00:23:24,692
Parties, too.

333
00:23:24,957 --> 00:23:26,775
Well, where is Michael tonight?

334
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:28,593
Oh, he shot himself last May.

335
00:23:33,735 --> 00:23:36,372
Kinda wished he'd left a note.
You know what I mean?

336
00:23:43,861 --> 00:23:45,370
Where's the bathroom?

337
00:23:47,086 --> 00:23:49,503
- It's up the stairs.
- Thanks, Sam.

338
00:23:49,783 --> 00:23:50,896
You're so nice.

339
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,602
Charlie.

340
00:24:09,085 --> 00:24:09,993
Weird.

341
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,060
Oh!

342
00:24:17,344 --> 00:24:18,700
Charlie?

343
00:24:21,323 --> 00:24:23,012
- Who is that kid?
- Relax.

344
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,890
Relax. He's a friend of mine.

345
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,600
Stay here.

346
00:24:26,601 --> 00:24:27,997
I didn't see anything.

347
00:24:28,032 --> 00:24:31,140
Yeah, I know you saw
something, but it's okay.

348
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,128
Okay, listen...

349
00:24:34,734 --> 00:24:36,428
Brad doesn't want anyone to know.

350
00:24:38,165 --> 00:24:39,914
Wait...

351
00:24:40,152 --> 00:24:42,616
- Are you baked?
- "Like a cake."

352
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:44,911
That's what Bob said.

353
00:24:45,148 --> 00:24:47,764
And how you can't have 3 on a
match because then they'd find us.

354
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:50,922
And everyone laughed,
but I don't understand what's funny.

355
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:54,607
Okay, Charlie, listen.

356
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,565
I need you to promise...

357
00:24:58,672 --> 00:25:01,890
...that you're not gonna say
anything to anyone about me and Brad.

358
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:05,574
Okay?
This has to be our little secret.

359
00:25:06,118 --> 00:25:07,771
Our little secret.

360
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:09,388
Agreed.

361
00:25:10,203 --> 00:25:12,309
Okay. Thank you.

362
00:25:12,882 --> 00:25:14,004
We'll talk later.

363
00:25:16,872 --> 00:25:18,396
I look forward to that big talk.

364
00:25:24,626 --> 00:25:26,667
Isn't this the best milkshake ever, Alice?

365
00:25:27,894 --> 00:25:29,538
It's even better than the first one.

366
00:25:31,837 --> 00:25:33,197
I need to talk to you.

367
00:25:35,271 --> 00:25:37,983
Charlie just told me that
his best friend shot himself.

368
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,364
I don't think he has any friends.

369
00:25:50,704 --> 00:25:53,699
Hey. Everyone. Everybody.

370
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,004
Everyone.

371
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,423
Raise your glasses to Charlie.

372
00:26:02,563 --> 00:26:04,636
- What did I do?
- You didn't do anything.

373
00:26:05,675 --> 00:26:07,870
We just wanna toast to our new friend.

374
00:26:07,905 --> 00:26:09,060
You see things.

375
00:26:09,662 --> 00:26:11,001
And you understand.

376
00:26:12,874 --> 00:26:14,235
You're a wallflower.

377
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,219
What is it? What's wrong?

378
00:26:20,536 --> 00:26:22,470
I didn't think anyone noticed me.

379
00:26:25,962 --> 00:26:28,912
Well, we didn't think there was
anyone cool left to meet.

380
00:26:28,952 --> 00:26:31,577
So, Come on, everyone.

381
00:26:33,511 --> 00:26:36,305
- To Charlie.
- To Charlie.

382
00:26:40,726 --> 00:26:43,167
Welcome to the island of misfit toys.

383
00:26:53,522 --> 00:26:56,800
- Oh, my God. What is this song!?
- Right? I have no idea.

384
00:26:57,226 --> 00:26:58,608
Have you ever heard this before?

385
00:26:59,428 --> 00:27:00,398
Never.

386
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,207
Patrick, We've gotta
go through the tunnel!

387
00:27:04,518 --> 00:27:07,089
- Sam, it's freezing.
- Patrick, it's the perfect song!

388
00:27:07,124 --> 00:27:08,691
No. Mama Patrick says no.

389
00:27:08,726 --> 00:27:12,548
Patrick. Patrick, it's Sam.
It's Sam speaking to you...

390
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:14,816
- ...I'm begging you to...
- I concede!

391
00:27:18,268 --> 00:27:19,334
What is she doing?

392
00:27:19,616 --> 00:27:21,674
Don't worry.
She does it all the time.

393
00:27:25,762 --> 00:27:27,054
Turn it up!

394
00:27:27,531 --> 00:27:28,765
You got it, your highness.

395
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:09,942
What?

396
00:28:11,624 --> 00:28:13,583
I feel infinite.

397
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,049
<i>Dear Friend...</i>

398
00:28:32,988 --> 00:28:37,019
<i>I'm sorry I haven't written for awhile, but
I've been trying hard not to be a loser.</i>

399
00:28:39,026 --> 00:28:41,224
<i>For example, I am trying to participate...</i>

400
00:28:41,225 --> 00:28:45,676
<i>...by listening to Sam's collection of big
rock ballads and thinking about love.</i>

401
00:28:47,179 --> 00:28:49,410
<i>Sam says they are kitschy and brilliant.</i>

402
00:28:49,754 --> 00:28:51,013
<i>I completely agree.</i>

403
00:28:55,221 --> 00:28:59,220
<i>I am also writing essays and
studying extra books outside of class.</i>

404
00:28:59,524 --> 00:29:01,734
<i>As it turns out,
Mr. Anderson is a writer.</i>

405
00:29:02,256 --> 00:29:06,002
<i>He even had a play put up in New York once,
which I think is very impressive.</i>

406
00:29:07,905 --> 00:29:10,459
<i>He and his wife might
go back there after this year.</i>

407
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,517
<i>I know this is selfish,
but I really hope he doesn't.</i>

408
00:29:16,084 --> 00:29:19,544
<i>My favorite time, though, is lunch
because I get to see Sam and Patrick.</i>

409
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:23,296
<i>We spend the time working
on Mary Elizabeth's fanzine...</i>

410
00:29:23,331 --> 00:29:25,702
<i>...about music and
The Rocky Horror Picture Show.</i>

411
00:29:25,788 --> 00:29:28,019
<i>It's called Punk Rocky.</i>

412
00:29:28,197 --> 00:29:32,596
<i>Mary Elizabeth is really interesting
because she is a Buddhist and a punk...</i>

413
00:29:32,597 --> 00:29:36,929
<i>...but somehow she always acts like
my father at the end of a "long day."</i>

414
00:29:37,487 --> 00:29:41,375
<i>Her best friend Alice loves vampires
and wants to go to film school.</i>

415
00:29:41,376 --> 00:29:43,459
<i>She also steals jeans from the mall.</i>

416
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:46,104
<i>I don't know why because
her family is rich...</i>

417
00:29:46,105 --> 00:29:48,197
<i>...but I'm trying not to be judgemental.</i>

418
00:29:48,401 --> 00:29:51,912
<i>Especially since I know that they
were all there for Patrick last year.</i>

419
00:29:52,717 --> 00:29:56,701
<i>Patrick never likes to be serious,
so it took me awhile to get what happened.</i>

420
00:29:57,652 --> 00:30:02,516
<i>When he was a junior, Patrick started
seeing Brad on the weekends in secret.</i>

421
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:03,844
<i>I guess it was hard, too...</i>

422
00:30:03,845 --> 00:30:06,956
<i>...because Brad had to get drunk
every time they fooled around.</i>

423
00:30:07,774 --> 00:30:09,965
<i>Then, Monday in school,
Brad would say:</i>

424
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,690
<i>"Man, I was so wasted.
I don't remember a thing."</i>

425
00:30:13,691 --> 00:30:15,504
<i>This went on for 7 months.</i>

426
00:30:16,527 --> 00:30:19,970
<i>When they finally did it,
Brad said he loved Patrick.</i>

427
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,857
<i>Then, he started to cry.</i>

428
00:30:22,565 --> 00:30:26,454
<i>No matter what Patrick did,
Brad kept saying his dad would kill him.</i>

429
00:30:26,715 --> 00:30:28,713
<i>And saying that he was going to hell.</i>

430
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:32,760
<i>Patrick was eventually
able to help Brad get sober.</i>

431
00:30:33,503 --> 00:30:37,985
<i>I asked Patrick if he felt sad
that he still had to keep it a secret...</i>

432
00:30:38,284 --> 00:30:39,688
<i>...and he said no...</i>

433
00:30:40,211 --> 00:30:43,656
<i>...because at least now, Brad
doesn't have to get drunk to love him.</i>

434
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:48,546
<i>I think that I understand
because I really like Sam.</i>

435
00:30:49,671 --> 00:30:51,078
<i>I asked my sister about her...</i>

436
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:53,375
<i>...and she said that
when Sam was a freshman...</i>

437
00:30:53,376 --> 00:30:56,883
<i>...the upper classmen used to
get her drunk at parties.</i>

438
00:30:56,884 --> 00:30:58,422
<i>I guess she had a reputation.</i>

439
00:30:58,821 --> 00:30:59,970
<i>But I don't care.</i>

440
00:31:00,649 --> 00:31:04,227
<i>I'd hate for her to judge me
based on what I used to be like.</i>

441
00:31:05,045 --> 00:31:08,335
<i>So, I've been making her a mix tape
so she will know how I feel.</i>

442
00:31:10,129 --> 00:31:11,406
Ah, shit!

443
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:12,897
<i>- C!
- C!</i>

444
00:31:13,032 --> 00:31:14,574
- Give a K!
- K!

445
00:31:14,575 --> 00:31:16,417
- Gimme a Y!
- Y!

446
00:31:16,452 --> 00:31:18,795
- What's that spell!?
- R-O-C-K-Y!

447
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:21,149
- I can't hear you!
- Rocky!

448
00:31:21,184 --> 00:31:23,504
- One more time!
- Rocky!

449
00:31:44,635 --> 00:31:48,680
# Whatever happened to Fae Wray? #

450
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:55,225
# That delicate, satin draped frame? #

451
00:31:57,553 --> 00:32:00,832
# As it clung to her thigh

452
00:32:02,145 --> 00:32:07,115
how I started to cry #

453
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,296
# 'cause I wanted to be dressed

454
00:32:12,034 --> 00:32:15,854
just the same. #

455
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:20,252
# Give yourself over

456
00:32:20,253 --> 00:32:23,850
to absolute pleasure #

457
00:32:24,427 --> 00:32:27,525
# Swim the warm waters

458
00:32:27,526 --> 00:32:31,088
of sins of the flesh #

459
00:32:31,611 --> 00:32:34,346
# Erotic nightmares

460
00:32:34,347 --> 00:32:37,725
beyond any measure #

461
00:32:38,364 --> 00:32:42,256
# And sensual daydreams

462
00:32:42,257 --> 00:32:46,333
to treasure forever #

463
00:32:47,311 --> 00:32:51,392
# Can't you just see it? #

464
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:54,302
# Woah oh oh! #

465
00:33:01,939 --> 00:33:04,345
# Don't Dream It

466
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:08,282
Be It #

467
00:33:12,662 --> 00:33:15,414
<i>That picture is gorgeous, Craig.
What did you use?</i>

468
00:33:15,613 --> 00:33:16,976
Oh, I know, thank you.

469
00:33:17,491 --> 00:33:20,007
Color film, but black and
white paper for the printing.

470
00:33:20,561 --> 00:33:24,354
Yeah. My professor gave me an "A,"
but for all the wrong reasons.

471
00:33:24,389 --> 00:33:25,762
Most of them are idiots.

472
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,112
You'll see what I mean
when you get to college.

473
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,563
How did your SAT's go by the way?

474
00:33:30,564 --> 00:33:31,929
1150.

475
00:33:32,223 --> 00:33:34,490
- I think I'll get into NYU.
- Yeah, I hope so.

476
00:33:34,749 --> 00:33:37,436
1490. Harvard. Face!

477
00:33:40,453 --> 00:33:42,716
So, Are you okay?

478
00:33:43,539 --> 00:33:45,389
Yeah. Yeah.

479
00:33:46,298 --> 00:33:48,801
But I got my SAT results back.

480
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:50,651
Oops.

481
00:33:51,072 --> 00:33:53,271
You can take them again, you know.

482
00:33:53,968 --> 00:33:56,514
Yeah, it's just if I'm going
to Penn State main campus...

483
00:33:56,549 --> 00:33:57,961
...I have to do much better.

484
00:33:58,862 --> 00:34:00,745
I wish I would have
studied freshman year.

485
00:34:02,014 --> 00:34:03,739
I was a bit of a mess.

486
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:07,864
I'll help you study for the next one.

487
00:34:08,287 --> 00:34:10,846
- Will you?
- Yeah, of course.

488
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,091
Thanks, Charlie.

489
00:34:26,328 --> 00:34:27,695
What's this?

490
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:30,604
Just a mix tape.
No big deal.

491
00:34:31,515 --> 00:34:33,626
My parents have a pretty good stereo, so...

492
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,208
It's all about that night in the tunnel.

493
00:34:37,652 --> 00:34:40,018
I couldn't find that song
we were listening to...

494
00:34:40,053 --> 00:34:42,384
...but, you know, I'm still
searching for it, so...

495
00:34:42,797 --> 00:34:43,794
It's okay.

496
00:34:45,128 --> 00:34:46,360
These are great.

497
00:34:47,525 --> 00:34:51,018
Nick Drake. The Shack's.

498
00:34:51,568 --> 00:34:54,491
You have really good taste, Charlie.

499
00:34:54,997 --> 00:34:56,026
Really?

500
00:34:56,424 --> 00:34:59,386
Yeah.
Way better than me as a freshman.

501
00:34:59,387 --> 00:35:01,953
- I used to listen to the worst top 40.
- No.

502
00:35:01,954 --> 00:35:02,956
Yeah, I did.

503
00:35:05,111 --> 00:35:06,373
Then I heard this old song.

504
00:35:08,242 --> 00:35:10,005
Pearly Dew Drops Drop.

505
00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:14,288
And I thought someday I would be
at a party in college or something.

506
00:35:14,323 --> 00:35:18,866
And I'd look up and see
this person across the room.

507
00:35:19,245 --> 00:35:24,329
And from that moment, I'd know
everything was going to be okay.

508
00:35:25,804 --> 00:35:27,117
You know what I mean?

509
00:35:29,474 --> 00:35:30,332
Yeah.

510
00:35:46,808 --> 00:35:49,269
- I hope it works out.
- I don't know.

511
00:35:50,035 --> 00:35:53,038
Craig would be a big
step up from her last boyfriend.

512
00:35:53,073 --> 00:35:53,934
No, shit.

513
00:35:53,969 --> 00:35:56,553
Who could forget Mr. Car Wash Loser?

514
00:35:56,588 --> 00:35:59,348
I just hope she could stop
playing dumb with these guys.

515
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:03,018
I keep telling her...
don't make yourself small.

516
00:36:04,672 --> 00:36:06,315
You can't save anybody.

517
00:36:08,838 --> 00:36:11,173
Man, your mix is morbidly sad, kid.

518
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:14,288
How about something
a little bit more upbeat, huh?

519
00:36:15,852 --> 00:36:18,578
So, Sam tells me
you want to be a writer.

520
00:36:20,138 --> 00:36:20,987
Yeah.

521
00:36:21,094 --> 00:36:23,059
Don't you write poetry, Craig?

522
00:36:25,553 --> 00:36:29,435
Poetry writes me.
You know?

523
00:36:30,594 --> 00:36:32,374
Let's get this party started.

524
00:36:56,324 --> 00:36:57,868
That was fast.

525
00:36:58,437 --> 00:37:00,244
- You want another one?
- Yeah.

526
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,943
Alright.

527
00:37:10,909 --> 00:37:12,160
Mr. Anderson.

528
00:37:14,321 --> 00:37:16,485
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

529
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:23,336
Why do nice people choose
the wrong people to date?

530
00:37:24,808 --> 00:37:27,212
Are we talking about anyone specific?

531
00:37:33,272 --> 00:37:35,799
We accept the love we think we deserve.

532
00:37:36,628 --> 00:37:38,777
Can we make them know
that they deserve more?

533
00:37:39,352 --> 00:37:40,704
We can try.

534
00:37:59,219 --> 00:38:00,905
- Hey.
- Hey! Hey, Sam.

535
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,592
I didn't see you come in.
How's it going?

536
00:38:03,211 --> 00:38:05,886
You want to work on
probabilities and statistics?

537
00:38:06,102 --> 00:38:06,990
Yeah, sure.

538
00:38:07,025 --> 00:38:10,329
Page 391 on your book.

539
00:38:12,445 --> 00:38:14,280
Hey, I ordered you some breakfast...

540
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:36,381
Dad, Can I have 30 dollars?

541
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,716
20 dollars?
What do you need 10 dollars for?

542
00:38:38,751 --> 00:38:40,306
Sam is doing secret santa.

543
00:38:40,341 --> 00:38:41,574
It's her favorite thing in the world.

544
00:38:41,609 --> 00:38:42,436
Please.

545
00:38:45,301 --> 00:38:46,956
Have fun.

546
00:38:48,967 --> 00:38:49,969
Thanks.

547
00:39:02,278 --> 00:39:03,090
Charlie!

548
00:39:03,691 --> 00:39:05,955
This was my favorite book growing up.

549
00:39:06,557 --> 00:39:09,768
This is my copy,
but I want you to have it.

550
00:39:11,343 --> 00:39:12,301
Thanks.

551
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,918
Have a great Christmas break.

552
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:15,626
You too, Mr. Anderson.

553
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,302
Terrible stain.

554
00:39:23,298 --> 00:39:27,017
That's pretty good, Charlie.

555
00:39:33,453 --> 00:39:34,966
You've gotta be kidding me.

556
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:37,928
If you fail me,
you get me next semester.

557
00:39:45,232 --> 00:39:46,460
C Minus!

558
00:39:46,495 --> 00:39:48,978
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am below average!

559
00:39:48,979 --> 00:39:51,312
- Below average!
- Below average!

560
00:39:51,313 --> 00:39:53,630
- Guys.1210.
- What?

561
00:39:55,485 --> 00:39:57,374
No more applications!

562
00:39:57,375 --> 00:39:59,202
No more SAT's!

563
00:39:59,237 --> 00:40:00,611
Thank you, Charlie!

564
00:40:01,518 --> 00:40:03,347
Alright. Alright, guys. I got...

565
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:06,986
...multiple pairs of blue jeans.

566
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:09,197
Wow. This is a really tough one, but...

567
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:11,170
...I'm gonna have to guess... Alice.

568
00:40:11,171 --> 00:40:15,888
Wait, guys... a receipt!
She actually paid!

569
00:40:15,923 --> 00:40:17,453
- Impossible!
- I'm so touched.

570
00:40:17,488 --> 00:40:20,162
- Where's Craig?
- Oh, he went home to Connecticut.

571
00:40:20,163 --> 00:40:21,820
But he'll be back for New Year's Eve.

572
00:40:22,552 --> 00:40:24,810
I'm sorry we won't be seeing him tonight.

573
00:40:25,535 --> 00:40:28,016
Alright, big brother by 3 weeks.

574
00:40:28,307 --> 00:40:30,895
- Who's your secret santa?
- I'll tell you, Sam.

575
00:40:31,464 --> 00:40:32,726
This one's tough.

576
00:40:32,946 --> 00:40:37,099
I have received a harmonica,
a magnetic poetry set...

577
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:39,311
...a book about Harvey Milk...

578
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:42,544
...and a mix tape
with the song "Asleep" on it...

579
00:40:42,579 --> 00:40:44,240
...twice.

580
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:45,837
I mean, I have no idea.

581
00:40:45,872 --> 00:40:48,070
This collection of presents is so gay...

582
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:50,872
...that I think I must
have given them to myself.

583
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:53,204
But despite that distinct possibility...

584
00:40:53,205 --> 00:40:55,272
...I'm gonna have to go with...

585
00:40:55,654 --> 00:40:57,729
...drum roll...

586
00:40:58,607 --> 00:40:59,806
Charlie.

587
00:41:00,247 --> 00:41:02,428
- Obviously.
- Beautifully done.

588
00:41:03,071 --> 00:41:05,532
Alright, Charlie. It's your turn.

589
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:09,309
Okey dokey.

590
00:41:09,739 --> 00:41:12,958
Uh, I have received...

591
00:41:13,756 --> 00:41:17,739
...socks, pants, a shirt, and a belt.

592
00:41:17,941 --> 00:41:19,704
I was ordered to wear them all tonight.

593
00:41:19,739 --> 00:41:23,760
So, I'm guessing my secret
santa is Mary Elizabeth.

594
00:41:24,712 --> 00:41:26,524
- Huh. Now, why do you say that?
- I don't know.

595
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:29,719
You know,
She bosses people around sometimes.

596
00:41:30,077 --> 00:41:32,223
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Sorry.

597
00:41:32,224 --> 00:41:36,011
You'll be surprised to know that
your secret santa is actually... me.

598
00:41:36,873 --> 00:41:37,892
Why all the clothes?

599
00:41:38,036 --> 00:41:40,876
Well, all the great writers
used to wear great suits.

600
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:44,988
So, your last present is on
a towel rack in the bathroom.

601
00:41:45,023 --> 00:41:46,830
Delve into our facilities.

602
00:41:47,583 --> 00:41:48,684
Emerge a star.

603
00:41:49,135 --> 00:41:50,537
<i>Oh, Perfect!</i>

604
00:41:50,897 --> 00:41:52,595
Will you hand these out while I'm gone?

605
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:54,514
Wait a second.
There's only secret santa presents.

606
00:41:54,549 --> 00:41:55,822
There's rules, Charlie.

607
00:41:55,823 --> 00:41:58,548
Mary Elizabeth, why are
you trying to eat Christmas?

608
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:00,058
Hand them out, Sam.

609
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:02,762
Alright.
Mary Elizabeth, for you.

610
00:42:04,177 --> 00:42:06,445
- Alice.
- Thanks.

611
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:08,712
Bob.

612
00:42:10,026 --> 00:42:11,809
And this one's for me.

613
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:14,466
"Alice, I know you'll get into NYU."

614
00:42:14,738 --> 00:42:16,082
40 dollars.

615
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:19,261
"To print Punk Rocky in color next time."

616
00:42:20,301 --> 00:42:21,705
He knows me.

617
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,139
He really knows me.

618
00:42:39,725 --> 00:42:41,398
Alright, Charlie.

619
00:42:42,368 --> 00:42:44,521
- Come on out.
- Get out here, buddy.

620
00:42:44,556 --> 00:42:46,674
- Come on! Charlie! Charlie!
- Charlie!

621
00:42:46,709 --> 00:42:48,846
- Charlie! Charlie!
- Don't be shy.

622
00:42:49,788 --> 00:42:50,821
Come out when...

623
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:01,105
Yeah!

624
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:06,128
What a display of man
I have ever seen!

625
00:43:06,689 --> 00:43:09,693
- Where are we going?
- It's a surprise.

626
00:43:12,168 --> 00:43:13,482
Is this your room?

627
00:43:18,288 --> 00:43:19,791
It's so cool.

628
00:43:20,398 --> 00:43:21,468
Thanks.

629
00:43:26,281 --> 00:43:27,954
You got me a present?

630
00:43:28,585 --> 00:43:30,829
After all your help on my
Penn State application?

631
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,102
Of course I did.

632
00:43:35,186 --> 00:43:36,090
Open it.

633
00:43:41,757 --> 00:43:44,161
- I don't know what to say.
- You don't have to say anything.

634
00:44:05,716 --> 00:44:08,642
I'm really sorry we
can't be here for your birthday.

635
00:44:08,677 --> 00:44:09,673
No, that's okay.

636
00:44:09,708 --> 00:44:11,821
I'm just sorry you have to
go back and visit your dad.

637
00:44:11,856 --> 00:44:14,584
I'm in such a great mood,
I don't think even he could ruin it.

638
00:44:14,619 --> 00:44:16,464
I feel like I'm finally doing good.

639
00:44:17,195 --> 00:44:19,969
- You are.
- Well, what about you?

640
00:44:21,136 --> 00:44:24,557
When I met you,
you were this scared freshman.

641
00:44:26,195 --> 00:44:27,681
Now look at you in that suit.

642
00:44:27,716 --> 00:44:30,594
You're like a sexy English school boy.

643
00:44:31,088 --> 00:44:33,600
- I saw Mary Elizabeth checking you out.
- No.

644
00:44:34,303 --> 00:44:35,465
Innocent.

645
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:37,588
Worst kind of guys.

646
00:44:37,813 --> 00:44:40,507
Never see you coming.
And parents love you.

647
00:44:41,164 --> 00:44:42,286
That's like...

648
00:44:43,688 --> 00:44:45,101
...extra danger.

649
00:44:45,136 --> 00:44:47,190
Yeah, well, it hasn't worked so far.

650
00:44:47,225 --> 00:44:49,243
You've never had a girlfriend?

651
00:44:49,244 --> 00:44:52,504
- Not even a 2nd grade valentine?
- No.

652
00:44:52,728 --> 00:44:54,244
Have you ever kissed a girl?

653
00:44:54,576 --> 00:44:55,538
No.

654
00:44:56,897 --> 00:44:58,410
What about you?

655
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:06,326
- Have I ever kissed a girl?
- No, no! Your first kiss...

656
00:45:07,858 --> 00:45:09,330
I was 11.

657
00:45:10,048 --> 00:45:11,684
His name was Robert.

658
00:45:11,719 --> 00:45:14,268
He used to come over to
the house all the time.

659
00:45:14,416 --> 00:45:15,811
Was he your first boyfriend?

660
00:45:17,223 --> 00:45:18,656
He was my...

661
00:45:19,267 --> 00:45:21,070
He was my dad's boss.

662
00:45:24,467 --> 00:45:26,790
You know Charlie, I used
to sleep with guys who...

663
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:28,626
...treated me like shit.

664
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,472
And get wasted all the time.

665
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:34,157
But now I feel like...

666
00:45:35,044 --> 00:45:36,652
...I have a chance. Like I...

667
00:45:37,216 --> 00:45:38,969
I could even get into a real college.

668
00:45:39,202 --> 00:45:41,156
Well, it's true. You can do it.

669
00:45:46,221 --> 00:45:47,853
You really think so?

670
00:45:52,191 --> 00:45:53,383
My Aunt...

671
00:45:54,665 --> 00:45:58,421
...had that same thing done to her, too.

672
00:45:59,074 --> 00:46:01,804
And she turned her life around.

673
00:46:03,112 --> 00:46:04,498
She must have been great.

674
00:46:05,814 --> 00:46:08,140
She was my favorite person in the world...

675
00:46:08,848 --> 00:46:10,236
...until now.

676
00:46:18,253 --> 00:46:19,586
Charlie...

677
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:25,295
I know that you know I like Craig.

678
00:46:26,487 --> 00:46:29,600
But I want to forget
that for a minute. Okay?

679
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:31,270
Okay.

680
00:46:32,043 --> 00:46:36,264
I just wanna make sure that
the first person who kisses you...

681
00:46:37,024 --> 00:46:38,276
...loves you.

682
00:46:38,747 --> 00:46:40,024
Okay?

683
00:46:43,659 --> 00:46:45,018
Okay.

684
00:47:03,688 --> 00:47:05,168
I love you, Charlie.

685
00:47:08,676 --> 00:47:10,334
I love you, too.

686
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:26,811
Have a good time at your mom's.

687
00:47:26,812 --> 00:47:29,408
Thanks. And listen, Charlie...

688
00:47:29,971 --> 00:47:32,247
...because your birthday
is on Christmas Eve...

689
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:34,416
...I figure you don't get
that many birthday presents.

690
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:38,788
I thought you should have my clock.
From the heart.

691
00:47:38,824 --> 00:47:40,278
Thank you, Patrick.

692
00:47:42,514 --> 00:47:43,676
- Bye.
- Bye.

693
00:47:44,902 --> 00:47:46,112
Have a good one, guys!

694
00:47:47,222 --> 00:47:48,962
I love you guys!

695
00:47:56,184 --> 00:47:57,264
Hey!

696
00:47:57,607 --> 00:47:59,710
Look who's here!

697
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:03,663
- Come here, little sister.
- Hey, Chris.

698
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,904
Hey, honey.

699
00:48:07,249 --> 00:48:09,224
Ma, you look so thin!

700
00:48:09,225 --> 00:48:10,001
Thank you.

701
00:48:11,223 --> 00:48:12,190
Charlie...

702
00:48:15,251 --> 00:48:17,093
- Come I got dinner ready.
- Oh, good.

703
00:48:17,128 --> 00:48:18,935
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

704
00:48:20,155 --> 00:48:21,958
Make a wish, honey.

705
00:48:33,476 --> 00:48:35,445
<i>Can you see it, Charlie?</i>

706
00:48:35,962 --> 00:48:39,493
The luminaria is a landing
strip for Santa Claus.

707
00:48:40,075 --> 00:48:41,644
Why don't you keep an eye out for him...

708
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:43,590
...and I'll be right back, okay?

709
00:48:45,625 --> 00:48:47,265
I'm going to get your birthday present.

710
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:00,787
Hey.

711
00:49:01,751 --> 00:49:03,052
Hey.

712
00:49:05,037 --> 00:49:06,695
God, I missed mom's cooking.

713
00:49:07,292 --> 00:49:08,823
You have no idea how good you have it.

714
00:49:11,097 --> 00:49:12,961
I'm actually beginning to hate pizza.

715
00:49:14,873 --> 00:49:16,671
So how are you liking school?

716
00:49:16,672 --> 00:49:19,771
Well, I'm no brainiac like you or Candace.

717
00:49:20,753 --> 00:49:21,964
But I'm doing okay.

718
00:49:21,965 --> 00:49:24,926
Okay?
You're playing in a Bowl Game.

719
00:49:32,827 --> 00:49:34,403
How are you feeling, Charlie?

720
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,391
Good.

721
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:39,523
You know what I mean.

722
00:49:40,424 --> 00:49:42,358
Is it bad tonight?

723
00:49:42,869 --> 00:49:44,887
No. No.

724
00:49:47,316 --> 00:49:49,321
I'm not picturing things anymore.

725
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,360
And even if I do, I can just shut it off.

726
00:49:55,169 --> 00:49:58,005
Well, you know, mom did say that
you have good friends now.

727
00:49:58,773 --> 00:50:01,836
And maybe if it does get bad again...

728
00:50:02,525 --> 00:50:04,635
- ...you can just talk to them, yeah?
- Yeah.

729
00:50:06,438 --> 00:50:07,820
Especially Sam.

730
00:50:08,521 --> 00:50:09,887
She's great.

731
00:50:10,369 --> 00:50:12,542
I'm gonna ask her out at New Years.

732
00:50:12,668 --> 00:50:14,942
Yeah, I think the time is right now.

733
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:50,618
How long does this take to work?

734
00:51:06,186 --> 00:51:07,418
Shoveling snow, huh?

735
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:11,274
I have to get this driveway clean.

736
00:51:11,645 --> 00:51:14,817
And then, I'm going
to congratulate you...

737
00:51:14,818 --> 00:51:17,915
...on being happy
because you deserve it.

738
00:51:19,433 --> 00:51:23,033
- You said that an hour ago.
- Was that tonight?

739
00:51:25,698 --> 00:51:29,925
Oh, I just saw this tree,
but it was a dragon...

740
00:51:30,769 --> 00:51:33,053
...and then it was a tree again
and it just lied to me.

741
00:51:33,079 --> 00:51:35,313
Okay, Charlie. Don't freak out.
Give me the...

742
00:51:36,255 --> 00:51:37,339
Calm down.

743
00:51:41,303 --> 00:51:42,235
Look up.

744
00:51:45,367 --> 00:51:46,469
Isn't it quiet?

745
00:51:49,517 --> 00:51:52,204
Sam, do you think that if people knew...

746
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:56,027
...how crazy you really were,
no one would ever talk to you?

747
00:51:58,181 --> 00:51:59,473
All the time.

748
00:52:03,669 --> 00:52:05,753
So, you wanna wear these glasses?

749
00:52:08,197 --> 00:52:09,680
They'll protect you.

750
00:53:32,134 --> 00:53:35,878
10-9-8-7-6...

751
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:39,623
...5-4-3-2-1...

752
00:53:39,626 --> 00:53:41,452
It's gonna be our little secret.

753
00:53:44,185 --> 00:53:46,456
...Happy New Year!

754
00:54:41,814 --> 00:54:43,695
Did your older friends pressure you?

755
00:54:43,696 --> 00:54:46,196
No one pressured me, officer.

756
00:54:46,787 --> 00:54:50,021
I would never do drugs. Never.

757
00:54:50,056 --> 00:54:53,637
Then, how did you happen to be passed out
on the ground at 6 in the morning?

758
00:54:54,999 --> 00:54:58,997
Well, I... you know, I was really tired...

759
00:54:59,478 --> 00:55:02,153
...and I was feeling feverish.

760
00:55:02,296 --> 00:55:07,210
So, I went outside for a walk,
just to get some cold air.

761
00:55:07,211 --> 00:55:09,515
I started seeing things.
So, I passed out.

762
00:55:09,891 --> 00:55:11,657
You're seeing things again, Charlie?

763
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:14,098
Not... Not really.

764
00:55:20,954 --> 00:55:22,305
Nice suit.

765
00:55:24,037 --> 00:55:25,812
It was a Christmas present.

766
00:55:30,629 --> 00:55:32,098
Did you have fun on your break?

767
00:55:32,733 --> 00:55:35,508
More fun than you're
gonna have today, Sinatra.

768
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,415
Nice look, jag off.

769
00:55:43,329 --> 00:55:44,851
I called him 30 times.

770
00:55:44,886 --> 00:55:47,336
Well what are we supposed to do?
We're going on in 10 minutes!

771
00:55:47,848 --> 00:55:49,739
- They said in health class...
- Hello?

772
00:55:49,774 --> 00:55:52,499
I know. They say that
about LSD just to scare you.

773
00:55:52,534 --> 00:55:53,407
Are you sure?

774
00:55:54,065 --> 00:55:55,468
Charlie, you're fine, man.

775
00:55:56,021 --> 00:55:58,084
Guys, we have an emergency.

776
00:55:58,119 --> 00:56:00,939
Craig has flaked out on us again.
So, I need a Rocky.

777
00:56:01,931 --> 00:56:03,690
- Brad?
- No, No way.

778
00:56:03,691 --> 00:56:06,658
No, I'm not...
There are people out here. No.

779
00:56:09,573 --> 00:56:11,019
Charlie...

780
00:56:11,394 --> 00:56:12,577
...take off your clothes.

781
00:56:19,206 --> 00:56:25,019
# Then if anything grows
while you pose #

782
00:56:25,054 --> 00:56:30,605
# I'll oil you up and drop you down #
# Down, Down Down #

783
00:56:30,827 --> 00:56:36,115
# And that's just one small
fraction of the main attraction #

784
00:56:36,772 --> 00:56:39,121
# You need a friendly hand #

785
00:56:39,615 --> 00:56:41,838
# And I need action #

786
00:56:42,225 --> 00:56:44,514
# Touch a touch a touch me #

787
00:56:44,808 --> 00:56:47,082
# I wanna be dirty #

788
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:49,741
# Thrill me. Chill me. Fulfill me #

789
00:56:50,282 --> 00:56:52,801
# Creature of the night #

790
00:56:53,059 --> 00:56:54,451
# Creature of our night #

791
00:56:55,547 --> 00:56:57,024
# Creature of our night? #

792
00:56:58,092 --> 00:56:59,938
# Creature of our night #

793
00:57:00,849 --> 00:57:02,779
# Creature of our night #

794
00:57:03,513 --> 00:57:05,138
# Creature of our night #

795
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:08,610
# Creature of our night #

796
00:57:08,897 --> 00:57:10,344
# Creature of our night #

797
00:57:11,956 --> 00:57:13,412
# Creature of our night #

798
00:57:21,802 --> 00:57:24,327
Maybe I could join the cast as an
alternate or something?

799
00:57:24,987 --> 00:57:27,490
Well, we're filled up now, but...

800
00:57:27,491 --> 00:57:30,195
...they're gonna need people
when we go to college.

801
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:32,960
I could put in a good word for you.

802
00:57:33,246 --> 00:57:35,311
- That'd be great. Thanks.
- Yeah.

803
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:40,392
Charlie...

804
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:43,907
Have you heard of the Sadie Hawkins dance?

805
00:57:44,329 --> 00:57:46,130
The one where the girl asks the guy.

806
00:57:46,412 --> 00:57:50,336
Obviously, it is completely
stupid and sexist.

807
00:57:50,337 --> 00:57:52,694
I mean it's like,
"Hey, thanks for the crumb."

808
00:57:52,695 --> 00:57:56,976
And normally, I'd just blow it off
because school dances suck torture.

809
00:57:57,011 --> 00:57:59,624
But, you know, it's my last year, and...

810
00:58:04,007 --> 00:58:07,737
- Would you maybe wanna go with me?
- You wanna go with me?

811
00:58:07,772 --> 00:58:09,947
I'm sick of macho guys.

812
00:58:10,434 --> 00:58:12,764
Plus, you looked
really cute in your costume.

813
00:58:13,265 --> 00:58:14,688
So, what do you say?

814
00:58:19,566 --> 00:58:22,182
- You must be Mary Elizabeth.
- Yes.

815
00:58:22,217 --> 00:58:25,519
- It's so nice to meet you.
- You, too, Mrs. Kelmeckis.

816
00:58:25,554 --> 00:58:27,608
Charlie tells me you're a Buddhist.

817
00:58:28,133 --> 00:58:30,101
- Please come in.
- Okay.

818
00:58:30,838 --> 00:58:33,410
A little closer together.
That looks nice.

819
00:58:33,889 --> 00:58:37,186
Buddhist, I need you to smile
a little bit more. There you go. Nice.

820
00:59:11,709 --> 00:59:13,300
Are you having a good time?

821
00:59:15,753 --> 00:59:18,167
Not really. How about you?

822
00:59:19,762 --> 00:59:21,439
I mean, I don't know.

823
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:23,965
It's my first date,
I don't know what to compare it to.

824
00:59:25,099 --> 00:59:26,558
You're doing fine.

825
00:59:30,243 --> 00:59:31,775
I'm sorry Craig couldn't come.

826
00:59:33,484 --> 00:59:37,847
Yeah. He said he didn't want to
go to some stupid high school dance.

827
00:59:37,848 --> 00:59:39,301
Can't say I blame him, really.

828
00:59:40,575 --> 00:59:43,805
I don't know.
If you like it, he should come.

829
00:59:49,322 --> 00:59:51,048
Thanks, Charlie.

830
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:56,769
Have a beautiful first date.
You deserve it.

831
00:59:57,781 --> 00:59:59,513
I'll try not to make you too jealous.

832
01:00:13,537 --> 01:00:14,705
Now, just let it breathe.

833
01:00:26,995 --> 01:00:28,491
This is sure a nice house.

834
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:30,221
Thanks.

835
01:00:35,439 --> 01:00:36,871
Don't you just love old music?

836
01:00:38,077 --> 01:00:39,267
Yeah.

837
01:00:39,726 --> 01:00:42,080
Good. Because I made you a mix of it.

838
01:00:44,264 --> 01:00:47,424
I'd love to expose you to great things.

839
01:00:47,459 --> 01:00:50,357
Like Billie Holiday and foreign films.

840
01:00:50,392 --> 01:00:52,998
This merlot is really fancy.

841
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:55,852
Yeah. My dad collects wine,
but he doesn't drink.

842
01:00:56,293 --> 01:00:57,876
It's kinda weird, isn't it?

843
01:00:58,086 --> 01:00:59,088
I guess.

844
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:01,281
Where are your parents?

845
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:04,371
Their club is hosting
a cotillion or something racist.

846
01:01:06,307 --> 01:01:08,329
They'll be gone all night.

847
01:01:14,445 --> 01:01:16,252
That's sure a nice fire.

848
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:18,550
Yeah.

849
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:20,743
When I'm done being a lobbyist...

850
01:01:20,744 --> 01:01:23,276
...I wanna move to a house
like this in Cape Cod.

851
01:01:23,923 --> 01:01:25,977
- Sounds nice, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

852
01:01:32,062 --> 01:01:33,845
Your heart is beating really fast.

853
01:01:34,216 --> 01:01:35,478
Is it?

854
01:01:35,838 --> 01:01:37,651
Here, feel.

855
01:01:43,421 --> 01:01:44,960
- Charlie?
- Uh-huh.

856
01:01:46,896 --> 01:01:49,034
- Do you like me?
- Uh-huh.

857
01:01:49,069 --> 01:01:50,052
You know what I mean.

858
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:51,744
I think so.

859
01:01:52,699 --> 01:01:53,818
Don't be nervous.

860
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:33,192
Charlie...

861
01:02:35,967 --> 01:02:38,351
...I didn't know how tonight
was gonna go tonight, but...

862
01:02:39,224 --> 01:02:41,927
- ...it was really nice, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

863
01:02:44,417 --> 01:02:46,094
I just can't believe it.

864
01:02:47,436 --> 01:02:48,988
You of all people.

865
01:02:49,258 --> 01:02:51,272
I just can't believe you're my boyfriend.

866
01:02:57,047 --> 01:02:59,392
Shit!
My parents! Shit!

867
01:02:59,427 --> 01:03:02,314
- Here, zip this up!
- Okay. No, no, I got this. Yeah.

868
01:03:02,596 --> 01:03:05,072
- Just zip it up, like a normal zipper!
- Stuck. It's just...

869
01:03:05,244 --> 01:03:06,006
Thank you.

870
01:03:07,022 --> 01:03:08,124
See you Monday.

871
01:03:09,502 --> 01:03:10,924
<i>Dear Friend...</i>

872
01:03:11,749 --> 01:03:14,520
<i>I'm sorry I haven't
written for awhile, but...</i>

873
01:03:15,073 --> 01:03:17,708
<i>...things are a total disaster.</i>

874
01:03:19,271 --> 01:03:21,389
We're literally making out,
and I'm in my bra.

875
01:03:21,424 --> 01:03:23,507
Hello! And the front door
opens. It's my parents!

876
01:03:23,542 --> 01:03:26,226
<i>I probably should have been
honest about how I didn't...</i>

877
01:03:26,261 --> 01:03:28,911
<i>...want to go out with Mary
Elizabeth after Sadie's, but...</i>

878
01:03:29,218 --> 01:03:31,495
<i>...I really didn't want
to hurt her feelings.</i>

879
01:03:32,723 --> 01:03:35,167
<i>You see, Mary Elizabeth
is a really nice person...</i>

880
01:03:35,202 --> 01:03:37,612
<i>...underneath the part of
her that hates everyone.</i>

881
01:03:37,893 --> 01:03:38,613
Hey!

882
01:03:38,711 --> 01:03:41,337
<i>And since I heard that having
a girlfriend makes you happy...</i>

883
01:03:41,372 --> 01:03:43,999
<i>...I tried hard to love her
like I love Sam.</i>

884
01:03:44,034 --> 01:03:46,310
Can you believe it's almost
our two week anniversary?

885
01:03:46,345 --> 01:03:47,497
Yeah, I know.

886
01:03:48,138 --> 01:03:49,772
<i>So, I took her on double dates.</i>

887
01:03:50,062 --> 01:03:51,895
Your first foreign film.

888
01:03:52,705 --> 01:03:56,924
- Do you want butter in your popcorn?
- Vegans don't eat butter.

889
01:03:56,971 --> 01:03:59,619
<i>And I tried not to mind that
she loves to hold hands...</i>

890
01:03:59,654 --> 01:04:01,483
<i>...even when her hands are sweaty.</i>

891
01:04:05,261 --> 01:04:09,066
<i>And I had to admit something
really upsetting. But...</i>

892
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:12,530
<i>I'm tired of touching her boobs.</i>

893
01:04:13,365 --> 01:04:16,473
<i>I thought maybe if she
would just let me pick...</i>

894
01:04:16,474 --> 01:04:19,552
<i>...the make-out music once in awhile,
we might have a chance.</i>

895
01:04:20,233 --> 01:04:24,421
<i>And maybe if she didn't put down the
books that Mr. Anderson gives me.</i>

896
01:04:25,662 --> 01:04:28,503
Walden?
I read this in 7th grade.

897
01:04:29,478 --> 01:04:32,007
I would have called it
"On Boring Pond."

898
01:04:32,253 --> 01:04:35,970
<i>Or if she would stop calling me
the minute I get home from school...</i>

899
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:41,011
<i>...when I have absolutely nothing to talk
about other than the bus ride home.</i>

900
01:04:42,535 --> 01:04:45,030
<i>Somehow she finds me things to say.</i>

901
01:04:45,230 --> 01:04:48,220
<i>That dairy just sits with you.
You know, it walks with you.</i>

902
01:04:48,255 --> 01:04:49,627
She's on the phone right now?

903
01:04:49,628 --> 01:04:51,665
Charlie, you've gotta break up with her.

904
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:52,872
I can do that?

905
01:04:52,907 --> 01:04:55,099
For Christ's sake...
I need to use the phone!

906
01:04:55,134 --> 01:04:57,694
<i>I'll give you this book.
It's really how I became a vegan...</i>

907
01:04:57,729 --> 01:04:59,277
<i>I know I should have been honest...</i>

908
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:02,781
<i>...but I was getting so mad,
it was starting to scare me.</i>

909
01:05:04,379 --> 01:05:07,720
<i>I just wish I could have found
another way to break up.</i>

910
01:05:07,721 --> 01:05:11,216
- Um... Mary Elizabeth. Can I talk to you...
- Charlie. Please, don't interrupt.

911
01:05:11,217 --> 01:05:12,000
<i>You know I hate that.</i>

912
01:05:12,001 --> 01:05:14,690
<i>In hindsight, I probably
could not have picked...</i>

913
01:05:14,725 --> 01:05:16,840
<i>...a worse way to be honest
with Mary Elizabeth.</i>

914
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:19,470
- Truth or dare?
- Who are you talking to?

915
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:23,975
I dare you... to kiss Alice.

916
01:05:26,161 --> 01:05:28,755
Courage your lions, procreator.

917
01:05:31,486 --> 01:05:32,293
Mary Elizabeth?

918
01:05:32,294 --> 01:05:34,331
Samantha told me that
you got into Harvard.

919
01:05:34,366 --> 01:05:36,853
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

920
01:05:36,888 --> 01:05:39,134
This one still hasn't gotten me flowers.

921
01:05:39,447 --> 01:05:40,778
But I forgive you.

922
01:05:42,423 --> 01:05:44,682
Hey, don't worry about Penn State.

923
01:05:44,683 --> 01:05:46,923
- You're just wait-listed.
- Yeah.

924
01:05:47,261 --> 01:05:52,109
You guys are about to miss
some severely hot "fag on goth" action.

925
01:05:59,158 --> 01:06:01,252
- Get a room!
- You're a monster!

926
01:06:01,706 --> 01:06:04,410
My turn. Um... let's see...

927
01:06:05,188 --> 01:06:07,344
Let's think... Charlie?

928
01:06:07,925 --> 01:06:10,489
- Truth.
- How's your first relationship going?

929
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,863
It's so bad...

930
01:06:12,898 --> 01:06:16,932
...that I keep fantasizing that
one of us is dying of cancer...

931
01:06:16,933 --> 01:06:20,108
...so that I don't have to
break up with her.

932
01:06:21,988 --> 01:06:23,059
Charlie?

933
01:06:23,263 --> 01:06:25,943
Truth or dare?
Hello?

934
01:06:28,436 --> 01:06:29,912
- Dare.
- Okay.

935
01:06:30,232 --> 01:06:35,370
I dare you to kiss the prettiest girl
in the room on the lips.

936
01:06:35,405 --> 01:06:38,056
And notice I charitably
said girl and not person...

937
01:06:38,091 --> 01:06:40,707
...because let's face it,
I'd smoke all you bitches.

938
01:06:50,875 --> 01:06:52,307
Now that's fucked up.

939
01:06:56,825 --> 01:06:59,328
Mary Elizabeth...

940
01:06:59,329 --> 01:07:00,669
I'm so sorry.

941
01:07:01,833 --> 01:07:03,856
It was a mistake. I'm sorry.

942
01:07:04,777 --> 01:07:06,549
Sam! Sam!

943
01:07:06,584 --> 01:07:08,794
I really didn't mean
anything by it. I'm sorry.

944
01:07:10,247 --> 01:07:11,899
What the hell is wrong with you?

945
01:07:14,023 --> 01:07:15,999
I should go back and apologize.

946
01:07:16,034 --> 01:07:19,030
No, Charlie, Trust me.
You don't want to go back there.

947
01:07:19,031 --> 01:07:20,308
But, I'm really sorry.

948
01:07:20,825 --> 01:07:22,224
I didn't mean to do anything...

949
01:07:22,259 --> 01:07:23,713
I know you didn't...

950
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:25,522
...but look.

951
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,573
I hate to be the one to break this...

952
01:07:30,861 --> 01:07:34,595
...but there's history with
Mary Elizabeth and Sam.

953
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:36,308
Other guys.

954
01:07:36,343 --> 01:07:38,146
Things that have nothing
to do with you.

955
01:07:38,181 --> 01:07:42,078
But it's best if you stay away for awhile.

956
01:07:43,992 --> 01:07:45,370
Oh, Okay.

957
01:07:50,198 --> 01:07:52,135
How long do you think?

958
01:07:59,905 --> 01:08:04,952
<i>Dear friend, I have not seen
my friends for 2 weeks now.</i>

959
01:08:10,584 --> 01:08:14,676
<i>I am starting to get bad again.</i>

960
01:08:21,606 --> 01:08:23,150
Charlie. Come on, get dressed.

961
01:08:23,151 --> 01:08:24,964
We're going to be late for Easter Mass.

962
01:08:24,999 --> 01:08:27,763
I'll... I'll be there in a minute.

963
01:08:30,498 --> 01:08:32,752
Our Father who art in Heaven.

964
01:08:32,753 --> 01:08:35,938
Hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come.

965
01:08:36,148 --> 01:08:39,105
Thy will be done on
earth as it is in Heaven.

966
01:08:39,106 --> 01:08:41,290
Give us this day our daily bread.

967
01:08:41,488 --> 01:08:46,595
And forgive us our trespasses as we
forgive those who trespass against us.

968
01:08:50,350 --> 01:08:53,262
And lead us not into temptation.
But deliver us...

969
01:08:53,297 --> 01:08:54,372
Mary Elizabeth...

970
01:08:54,373 --> 01:08:57,492
I've been listening to the
Billie Holiday CD like every night...

971
01:08:57,527 --> 01:08:59,227
It's too late, Charlie.

972
01:08:59,262 --> 01:09:02,712
Look, I know. I just feel really
bad about what I did.

973
01:09:03,288 --> 01:09:06,720
I just get so messed up inside
like I'm not there or something.

974
01:09:06,755 --> 01:09:08,063
Tell it to someone who cares.

975
01:09:08,098 --> 01:09:11,220
I know. I'm sorry. I just...
We've all become such good friends...

976
01:09:11,255 --> 01:09:12,538
Good friends?

977
01:09:12,539 --> 01:09:15,366
Do you mean the people that
I've known since kindergarten...

978
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:18,716
...and you've known for 6 months?
Those good friends?

979
01:09:18,717 --> 01:09:20,880
Yeah. I mean I just don't want to
do anything to ruin our relat...

980
01:09:20,881 --> 01:09:24,088
It's ruined. Okay?
So, stop calling everyone.

981
01:09:24,123 --> 01:09:26,074
Stop embarrassing yourself.

982
01:09:26,109 --> 01:09:28,664
Okay. I will. Goodb...

983
01:09:34,015 --> 01:09:35,545
Something's wrong with me.

984
01:09:35,546 --> 01:09:37,067
Don't worry about it.

985
01:09:39,177 --> 01:09:42,237
Hey, you heard from Patrick?

986
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:44,397
No. He told me to stay away.

987
01:09:44,690 --> 01:09:47,028
Oh. You don't know?

988
01:09:47,386 --> 01:09:49,777
Why? Why? What happened?

989
01:09:49,778 --> 01:09:52,208
Brad's father caught them together.

990
01:09:56,341 --> 01:10:00,490
<i>- Some kids jumped him outside the O.
- It was some kids from North Hills.</i>

991
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:01,933
<i>Did you see his face?</i>

992
01:10:03,104 --> 01:10:04,796
<i>- What happened?
- It's not what I heard.</i>

993
01:10:07,722 --> 01:10:11,195
- Are you okay?
- Not now, Charlie. I'm sorry.

994
01:10:20,110 --> 01:10:21,000
Hey, nothing.

995
01:10:30,509 --> 01:10:32,064
Sorry, Nothing.

996
01:10:43,464 --> 01:10:46,130
- You gonna do anything?
- What are you talking about?

997
01:10:46,165 --> 01:10:48,768
I'm talking about your
pet ape just tripped me.

998
01:10:48,769 --> 01:10:50,503
Are you gonna say something?

999
01:10:51,733 --> 01:10:54,214
- Why would I?
- You know why.

1000
01:10:54,633 --> 01:10:57,300
This is pathetic, man.
Your fixation on me.

1001
01:10:57,301 --> 01:10:59,886
Do you want your friends to know
how you got those bruises? Really?

1002
01:10:59,921 --> 01:11:03,116
- I got jumped in a parking lot.
- Where? Schenley Park?

1003
01:11:03,151 --> 01:11:05,222
Do you guys know about Schenley Park?

1004
01:11:06,054 --> 01:11:08,301
I don't know what kind of
sick shit you're trying to pull.

1005
01:11:08,302 --> 01:11:10,331
But you better walk away now...

1006
01:11:12,407 --> 01:11:13,741
...Nothing.

1007
01:11:14,484 --> 01:11:15,737
Fine.

1008
01:11:17,078 --> 01:11:18,920
Say hi to your dad for me.

1009
01:11:22,029 --> 01:11:23,581
Whatever, faggot.

1010
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,388
- What did you just call me?
- I called you a faggo...

1011
01:11:44,282 --> 01:11:46,934
Say that shit again!
Say that shit again!

1012
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:48,122
It's Patrick!

1013
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:51,427
No! No!

1014
01:11:59,887 --> 01:12:02,701
Stop! Please, they don't stop!

1015
01:12:37,781 --> 01:12:40,394
Touch my friends again
and I'll blind you.

1016
01:12:50,361 --> 01:12:52,457
- Charlie?
- Yeah?

1017
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:55,470
Thanks for stopping them.

1018
01:12:58,104 --> 01:12:59,121
Sure, Brad.

1019
01:13:21,143 --> 01:13:22,715
How you doing, Charlie?

1020
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:24,620
I don't know.

1021
01:13:25,105 --> 01:13:27,958
I keep trying, but I can't
really remember what I did.

1022
01:13:29,328 --> 01:13:30,664
Do you want me to tell you?

1023
01:13:32,610 --> 01:13:33,907
Yeah.

1024
01:13:33,942 --> 01:13:35,989
You saved my brother.

1025
01:13:37,139 --> 01:13:38,704
That's what you did.

1026
01:13:39,305 --> 01:13:41,607
- So, you're not gonna scare of me?
- No.

1027
01:13:44,722 --> 01:13:45,981
Can we be friends again?

1028
01:13:46,016 --> 01:13:47,633
Of course.

1029
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:56,933
Come on.

1030
01:13:59,616 --> 01:14:00,938
Let's go be psychos together.

1031
01:14:07,411 --> 01:14:09,379
I'm dating Peter now.

1032
01:14:10,501 --> 01:14:12,116
He's in college with Craig.

1033
01:14:12,151 --> 01:14:15,548
He's opinionated, and we
have intellectual debates.

1034
01:14:15,857 --> 01:14:19,487
You were very sweet, but our
relationship was too one-sided.

1035
01:14:20,005 --> 01:14:21,821
I know this is hard for you.

1036
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:25,127
I'm just glad you're happy.

1037
01:14:25,162 --> 01:14:26,098
Okay.

1038
01:14:31,474 --> 01:14:34,437
Hey, Craig, Sam will be down soon.

1039
01:14:35,682 --> 01:14:36,870
We're gonna miss the movie.

1040
01:14:36,905 --> 01:14:39,558
Yeah, I'll go put
some pep in her step.

1041
01:14:42,843 --> 01:14:45,646
Hey, do you wanna get out of here?

1042
01:14:45,968 --> 01:14:47,725
Sure, Patrick

1043
01:14:50,443 --> 01:14:52,512
I'll tell you something, Charlie.
I feel good.

1044
01:14:52,513 --> 01:14:53,480
You know what I mean?

1045
01:14:53,515 --> 01:14:56,519
And maybe tomorrow I'll take you
to this karaoke place downtown.

1046
01:14:56,929 --> 01:14:59,285
And this club off the strip.
They don't card.

1047
01:14:59,286 --> 01:15:00,770
And the Schenley Park scene.

1048
01:15:01,246 --> 01:15:03,603
You have to see the
"fruit loop" at least one time.

1049
01:15:16,177 --> 01:15:17,338
Oh, my God.

1050
01:15:17,373 --> 01:15:20,220
My life is officially
an after school special.

1051
01:15:20,652 --> 01:15:21,830
Son of a bitch!

1052
01:15:22,814 --> 01:15:23,774
It really is.

1053
01:15:24,673 --> 01:15:25,985
It so is.

1054
01:15:29,834 --> 01:15:33,056
So, you ever hear the
one about Lily Miller?

1055
01:15:33,091 --> 01:15:34,942
- I don't know.
- Really?

1056
01:15:35,667 --> 01:15:38,004
I thought your brother would
have told you. It's a classic.

1057
01:15:38,376 --> 01:15:39,934
- Maybe.
- Okay.

1058
01:15:40,163 --> 01:15:43,319
Lily comes here one night
with this guy Parker.

1059
01:15:43,354 --> 01:15:46,893
And this was to be the night that
they were gonna lose their virginity.

1060
01:15:46,928 --> 01:15:49,787
So, she did it really proper.
She packed a picnic.

1061
01:15:49,822 --> 01:15:51,391
Stole a bottle of wine.

1062
01:15:51,848 --> 01:15:56,049
Everything was perfect,
and they're just about to 'do it'...

1063
01:15:56,582 --> 01:15:59,109
...when they realize they
forgot the condoms.

1064
01:15:59,144 --> 01:16:01,666
- So, what do you think happened?
- I don't know.

1065
01:16:02,539 --> 01:16:04,488
They did it with one of the sandwich bags.

1066
01:16:05,234 --> 01:16:06,462
Ew!

1067
01:16:08,036 --> 01:16:11,122
- Oh, that's disgusting!
- Yes! It is!

1068
01:16:11,434 --> 01:16:13,860
Come on.
Let's keep the train rolling.

1069
01:16:14,204 --> 01:16:16,286
Suburban legend. Charlie!

1070
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:18,153
Well...

1071
01:16:18,188 --> 01:16:20,943
There was this girl named
Second Base Stace.

1072
01:16:21,433 --> 01:16:24,911
And... well, She had boobs
in the like 4th grade...

1073
01:16:24,946 --> 01:16:27,177
Mosquito bites. Promising. Go.

1074
01:16:27,212 --> 01:16:30,582
And she let some
of the guys feel them.

1075
01:16:32,239 --> 01:16:34,283
That's your suburban legend?

1076
01:16:34,501 --> 01:16:37,004
- Did you at least cop a feel?
- Yeah.

1077
01:16:37,005 --> 01:16:38,606
- No.
- No, of course not.

1078
01:16:38,641 --> 01:16:42,539
You went home,
listened to "Asleep", wrote a poem...

1079
01:16:42,574 --> 01:16:44,978
Fine! Okay. Your turn.

1080
01:16:50,123 --> 01:16:51,375
Yeah, I've got one.

1081
01:16:53,776 --> 01:16:54,958
Well...

1082
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:59,622
There was this one guy.
Queer as a 3 dollar bill.

1083
01:17:00,353 --> 01:17:02,683
The guy's father
doesn't know about his son.

1084
01:17:03,859 --> 01:17:06,987
So, he comes
into the basement one night...

1085
01:17:06,988 --> 01:17:08,727
...when he's supposed to be out of town.

1086
01:17:09,508 --> 01:17:12,070
Catches his son with another boy.

1087
01:17:13,093 --> 01:17:14,892
So, he starts beating him.

1088
01:17:14,893 --> 01:17:18,283
But not like the slap kind.
Like the real kind.

1089
01:17:22,079 --> 01:17:26,015
And the boyfriend says,
"Stop. You're killing him."

1090
01:17:27,778 --> 01:17:30,342
But the son just yells "Get out."

1091
01:17:32,047 --> 01:17:33,058
And...

1092
01:17:33,543 --> 01:17:35,166
...eventually...

1093
01:17:36,282 --> 01:17:39,527
...the boyfriend just did.

1094
01:17:46,329 --> 01:17:48,027
Why can't you save anybody?

1095
01:17:50,525 --> 01:17:52,033
I don't know.

1096
01:17:54,565 --> 01:17:56,005
Forget it.

1097
01:17:56,999 --> 01:17:58,018
I'm free now, right?

1098
01:17:59,270 --> 01:18:01,799
I could meet the
love of my life any second.

1099
01:18:02,985 --> 01:18:06,025
Things will be different now,
and that's good.

1100
01:18:06,026 --> 01:18:08,094
I just need to meet a good guy...

1101
01:18:09,748 --> 01:18:10,980
Yeah.

1102
01:18:24,319 --> 01:18:25,630
I'm sorry.

1103
01:18:25,665 --> 01:18:26,941
It's alright.

1104
01:18:27,993 --> 01:18:29,289
It's alright.

1105
01:18:33,842 --> 01:18:36,551
<i>I've been spending
a lot of time with Patrick.</i>

1106
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:39,358
<i>He begins every night really excited.</i>

1107
01:18:40,724 --> 01:18:44,267
<i>He always says he feels free,
and tonight is his destiny.</i>

1108
01:18:45,105 --> 01:18:48,053
<i>But after awhile, he runs out
of things to keep himself numb.</i>

1109
01:18:50,911 --> 01:18:53,465
<i>Then, Sam got her letter from Penn State.</i>

1110
01:19:00,234 --> 01:19:03,267
"We will require you to take our
summer session at the main campus...

1111
01:19:03,302 --> 01:19:05,700
...immediately following your
high school graduation."

1112
01:19:09,361 --> 01:19:10,921
She got in, Charlie.

1113
01:19:22,414 --> 01:19:26,567
<i>After that all Patrick could talk about
was college and all their futures.</i>

1114
01:19:27,325 --> 01:19:30,055
<i>Alice did get into NYU Film School.</i>

1115
01:19:30,090 --> 01:19:32,440
<i>Patrick is going to the
University of Washington...</i>

1116
01:19:32,475 --> 01:19:34,790
<i>...because he wants to be
near the music in Seattle.</i>

1117
01:19:36,173 --> 01:19:40,610
<i>But he wasn't going to leave without
organizing the best senior prank ever.</i>

1118
01:19:47,375 --> 01:19:50,168
<i>Sam is going to leave
right after graduation.</i>

1119
01:19:50,169 --> 01:19:52,349
<i>It all feels very exciting.</i>

1120
01:19:52,384 --> 01:19:54,296
<i>I just wish it were happening to me.</i>

1121
01:19:55,176 --> 01:19:59,150
<i>Especially because ever since
I blacked out in the cafeteria...</i>

1122
01:19:59,151 --> 01:20:00,868
<i>...it's been getting worse.</i>

1123
01:20:00,903 --> 01:20:02,997
<i>And I can't turn it off this time.</i>

1124
01:20:04,422 --> 01:20:07,835
Guys, you want to pass your copies
of Gatsby up to the front please?

1125
01:20:08,356 --> 01:20:09,629
And I know it's the last day...

1126
01:20:09,664 --> 01:20:12,357
...but if we could just
keep it to a dull roar...

1127
01:20:12,358 --> 01:20:13,446
...I'd appreciate it.

1128
01:20:14,527 --> 01:20:15,420
Thank you.

1129
01:20:15,421 --> 01:20:18,713
Guys, guys,
Thank you for such a great year.

1130
01:20:18,748 --> 01:20:20,758
I had a blast.
I hope you did, too.

1131
01:20:20,793 --> 01:20:23,488
And I hope you have a great time
this summer on your vacations.

1132
01:20:23,523 --> 01:20:26,183
Now, who here is gonna read
for pleasure this summer?

1133
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:33,813
Charlie, Very good.

1134
01:20:43,780 --> 01:20:45,512
Last day.

1135
01:20:45,547 --> 01:20:47,245
Yeah.

1136
01:20:47,996 --> 01:20:51,532
So, I know it's none of my business,
but have you decided?

1137
01:20:52,324 --> 01:20:53,956
I mean, are you going to New York?

1138
01:20:55,409 --> 01:20:59,055
Well, my wife and I like it here.

1139
01:21:00,695 --> 01:21:03,282
And I think I might be better
at teaching than writing.

1140
01:21:04,473 --> 01:21:06,427
You know, Charlie.
I was thinking that...

1141
01:21:08,255 --> 01:21:10,528
...Maybe I could still give
you books next year.

1142
01:21:10,764 --> 01:21:12,304
Yeah. Yeah.

1143
01:21:12,807 --> 01:21:14,960
I think you could write
one of them one day.

1144
01:21:16,333 --> 01:21:17,305
Really?

1145
01:21:17,690 --> 01:21:18,691
I do.

1146
01:21:21,768 --> 01:21:23,715
You're the best teacher I've ever had.

1147
01:21:24,496 --> 01:21:25,538
Thank you.

1148
01:21:35,659 --> 01:21:39,583
10, 9, 8, 7, 6...

1149
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:42,065
...5, 4, 3, 2...

1150
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:44,169
- Let's get the hell out of here!
- One!

1151
01:21:50,846 --> 01:21:52,104
<i>Dear Friend...</i>

1152
01:21:52,516 --> 01:21:54,663
<i>I wanted to tell you about us running.</i>

1153
01:21:55,104 --> 01:21:56,982
<i>There was this beautiful sunset.</i>

1154
01:21:57,017 --> 01:21:59,479
<i>And just a few hours
before, everyone I love...</i>

1155
01:21:59,514 --> 01:22:01,821
<i>...had their last day
of high school ever.</i>

1156
01:22:02,389 --> 01:22:04,034
<i>And I was happy
because they were happy...</i>

1157
01:22:04,069 --> 01:22:06,237
<i>...even though I counted,
and I have...</i>

1158
01:22:06,963 --> 01:22:09,685
<i>...1,095 days to go.</i>

1159
01:22:11,128 --> 01:22:13,454
<i>I kept imagining what school
would be like without them...</i>

1160
01:22:13,455 --> 01:22:15,644
<i>...as they they were all
getting ready for their prom.</i>

1161
01:22:16,619 --> 01:22:19,582
<i>My sister finally decided
to break up with Derek...</i>

1162
01:22:19,583 --> 01:22:21,902
<i>...and go stag with her
girlfriends instead.</i>

1163
01:22:24,299 --> 01:22:26,574
<i>And then there was Sam.</i>

1164
01:22:26,781 --> 01:22:28,974
<i>I've looked at her
pictures since that night.</i>

1165
01:22:30,108 --> 01:22:32,733
<i>I like to see how happy
she was before she knew.</i>

1166
01:22:33,795 --> 01:22:36,861
<i>They were in a hotel suite after prom
when the truth came out...</i>

1167
01:22:37,607 --> 01:22:41,087
<i>Basically, Craig has been
cheating on Sam the whole time.</i>

1168
01:22:41,306 --> 01:22:45,744
<i>When I heard that, I kept thinking
about the happy girl in these pictures.</i>

1169
01:22:46,114 --> 01:22:49,907
<i>Because she doesn't
have 1,095 days to go.</i>

1170
01:22:50,338 --> 01:22:51,348
<i>She made it.</i>

1171
01:22:51,787 --> 01:22:53,159
<i>This is her time.</i>

1172
01:22:54,298 --> 01:22:56,836
<i>And no one should be
able to take that away.</i>

1173
01:22:59,737 --> 01:23:01,573
- Congratulations.
- Oh, Charlie! Charlie's here!

1174
01:23:01,574 --> 01:23:02,801
Guys, group photo!

1175
01:23:02,836 --> 01:23:04,145
We should all take a group photo.

1176
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:06,269
Oh, get against the railing
and try to look suave!

1177
01:23:06,404 --> 01:23:08,908
Yeah, this is the one.
That's gonna be a great angle.

1178
01:23:17,094 --> 01:23:18,514
<i>At her going away party...</i>

1179
01:23:18,549 --> 01:23:21,994
<i>...I wanted her to know about that night
we went through the tunnel.</i>

1180
01:23:22,269 --> 01:23:26,156
<i>And how for the first time,
I felt like I belonged somewhere.</i>

1181
01:23:28,163 --> 01:23:30,133
<i>And tomorrow, she's leaving.</i>

1182
01:23:31,064 --> 01:23:33,027
<i>So, I wanted to give her a part of me.</i>

1183
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:37,747
Are these all your books, Charlie?

1184
01:23:47,902 --> 01:23:50,807
- Thanks for staying up with me.
- Sure.

1185
01:23:52,107 --> 01:23:56,436
My brother said Penn State has this
restaurant called Ye Olde College Diner.

1186
01:23:57,137 --> 01:23:59,509
You have to get a grilled
stickie on your first night.

1187
01:23:59,544 --> 01:24:01,294
It's a tradition.

1188
01:24:02,469 --> 01:24:04,471
- That sounds like fun.
- Yeah.

1189
01:24:07,654 --> 01:24:10,285
Pretty soon, you'll have a whole
new group of friends, you know.

1190
01:24:11,931 --> 01:24:13,784
You won't even think
about this place anymore.

1191
01:24:16,438 --> 01:24:17,692
Yes, I will.

1192
01:24:31,724 --> 01:24:33,115
I had lunch with Craig today.

1193
01:24:35,102 --> 01:24:35,945
Yeah?

1194
01:24:36,382 --> 01:24:37,858
He said he was sorry and that...

1195
01:24:38,072 --> 01:24:39,707
...I was right to break up with him.

1196
01:24:42,369 --> 01:24:46,777
I'm driving away,
and I'm just feeling so small.

1197
01:24:47,158 --> 01:24:51,595
Just asking myself
why do I and everyone I love...

1198
01:24:53,289 --> 01:24:55,918
...pick people who
treat us like we're nothing?

1199
01:25:01,152 --> 01:25:03,442
We accept the love we think we deserve.

1200
01:25:10,347 --> 01:25:12,861
Then, why didn't you ever ask me out?

1201
01:25:19,758 --> 01:25:20,704
I, uh...

1202
01:25:21,876 --> 01:25:23,589
I just didn't think that you wanted that.

1203
01:25:24,527 --> 01:25:25,842
Well, what did you want?

1204
01:25:28,136 --> 01:25:30,184
I just want you to be happy.

1205
01:25:31,148 --> 01:25:32,721
Don't you get it, Charlie?

1206
01:25:34,056 --> 01:25:35,751
I can't feel that.

1207
01:25:36,816 --> 01:25:38,736
It's really sweet and everything, but...

1208
01:25:39,769 --> 01:25:42,886
...you can't just sit there and
put everybody's lives ahead of yours...

1209
01:25:42,921 --> 01:25:44,410
...and think that counts as love.

1210
01:25:44,772 --> 01:25:47,030
I don't wanna be somebody's crush.

1211
01:25:48,502 --> 01:25:50,968
I want people to like the real me.

1212
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:56,494
I know who you are, Sam.

1213
01:26:02,713 --> 01:26:04,265
I know I'm quiet...

1214
01:26:05,708 --> 01:26:08,132
...and I know I should speak more...

1215
01:26:08,734 --> 01:26:10,746
...but if you knew the things that...

1216
01:26:10,747 --> 01:26:13,753
...that were in my head
most of the time, you'd know...

1217
01:26:14,024 --> 01:26:15,625
...what it really meant.

1218
01:26:18,058 --> 01:26:19,604
How much we are alike.

1219
01:26:21,006 --> 01:26:23,102
And how we've been
through the same things.

1220
01:26:24,689 --> 01:26:26,342
And you're not small.

1221
01:26:27,230 --> 01:26:28,325
You're beautiful.

1222
01:26:55,096 --> 01:26:57,633
- What's wrong, Charlie?
- Oh, nothing.

1223
01:27:24,604 --> 01:27:26,068
Promise you're gonna call.

1224
01:27:26,610 --> 01:27:28,512
You know I'm gonna call you all the time.

1225
01:27:28,547 --> 01:27:30,801
- We'll all see each other in New York.
- All the time.

1226
01:27:33,764 --> 01:27:35,094
Come on, Sam.

1227
01:28:17,452 --> 01:28:18,835
What's wrong, Charlie?

1228
01:28:22,396 --> 01:28:25,098
- Put your seat belt on.
- We'll meet you there.

1229
01:28:48,957 --> 01:28:50,347
Don't wake your sister.

1230
01:29:03,273 --> 01:29:05,524
It'll be our little secret, okay?

1231
01:29:07,608 --> 01:29:09,934
<i>Look, Charlie.
She's fast asleep.</i>

1232
01:29:12,987 --> 01:29:14,723
<i>Don't wake your sister.</i>

1233
01:29:20,974 --> 01:29:23,848
My fault.
My fault.

1234
01:29:24,447 --> 01:29:27,115
<i>My fault.
It was all my fault.</i>

1235
01:29:28,173 --> 01:29:29,625
<i>It'll be our little secret, okay?</i>

1236
01:29:29,660 --> 01:29:31,078
<i>Stop it.</i>

1237
01:29:32,557 --> 01:29:33,564
<i>Stop.</i>

1238
01:29:37,623 --> 01:29:39,084
Stop crying.

1239
01:29:39,781 --> 01:29:41,414
Stop crying.

1240
01:29:48,632 --> 01:29:50,218
<i>It'll be our little secret.</i>

1241
01:29:56,806 --> 01:29:58,702
Candace, your brother's on the phone.

1242
01:30:01,530 --> 01:30:02,403
Hello.

1243
01:30:02,846 --> 01:30:04,892
- Hey, Candace.
- Charlie?

1244
01:30:04,927 --> 01:30:06,858
<i>Sam and Patrick left, and...</i>

1245
01:30:06,859 --> 01:30:09,855
<i>...I just can't stop
thinking about something.</i>

1246
01:30:09,890 --> 01:30:11,204
What?

1247
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:12,317
<i>Candace...</i>

1248
01:30:13,358 --> 01:30:15,428
<i>...I killed Aunt Helen, didn't I?</i>

1249
01:30:16,124 --> 01:30:19,815
<i>She died getting my birthday present,
so I guess I killed her, right?</i>

1250
01:30:21,004 --> 01:30:23,207
<i>I've tried to stop
thinking that, but I can't.</i>

1251
01:30:23,242 --> 01:30:24,398
<i>She keeps driving away...</i>

1252
01:30:24,433 --> 01:30:26,728
- ...and dying over and over.
- Call the police and send them to my house.

1253
01:30:26,763 --> 01:30:30,099
- And I can't stop her. I'm crazy again.
- No, Charlie, listen to me.

1254
01:30:30,134 --> 01:30:31,996
Mom and dad are going to be
home with Chris any second.

1255
01:30:32,031 --> 01:30:36,918
<i>I was just thinking...
what if I wanted her to die, Candace?</i>

1256
01:30:36,953 --> 01:30:40,635
What? Charlie? Charlie!

1257
01:31:15,611 --> 01:31:16,803
Charlie?

1258
01:31:18,009 --> 01:31:19,341
I'm Dr. Burton.

1259
01:31:24,271 --> 01:31:25,603
Where am I?

1260
01:31:25,834 --> 01:31:27,436
Mayview hospital.

1261
01:31:31,612 --> 01:31:34,820
You have to let me go.
My dad can't afford it.

1262
01:31:34,855 --> 01:31:37,336
- Don't worry about that.
- No.

1263
01:31:38,754 --> 01:31:40,752
I saw them when I was little.

1264
01:31:40,753 --> 01:31:43,339
And I don't want to be a Mayview kid.

1265
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:45,435
Just tell me how to stop it.

1266
01:31:45,916 --> 01:31:47,208
Stop what?

1267
01:31:48,580 --> 01:31:50,133
Seeing it.

1268
01:31:52,487 --> 01:31:55,827
All their lives. All the time.

1269
01:31:55,862 --> 01:31:59,167
Just... how do you stop seeing it?

1270
01:31:59,202 --> 01:32:00,911
Seeing what, Charlie?

1271
01:32:01,542 --> 01:32:06,600
There is so much pain.

1272
01:32:07,201 --> 01:32:10,957
And I don't know
how to not notice it.

1273
01:32:12,039 --> 01:32:13,560
What's hurting you?

1274
01:32:13,595 --> 01:32:17,348
No! Not me.
It's them. It's everyone.

1275
01:32:17,896 --> 01:32:19,511
It never stops.

1276
01:32:20,971 --> 01:32:22,516
Do you understand?

1277
01:32:28,780 --> 01:32:30,189
What about your Aunt Helen?

1278
01:32:35,247 --> 01:32:36,559
What about her?

1279
01:32:37,482 --> 01:32:38,813
You see her?

1280
01:32:42,251 --> 01:32:43,347
Yes.

1281
01:32:44,432 --> 01:32:46,336
She had a terrible life.

1282
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:50,754
But... I mean, what am I...

1283
01:32:50,755 --> 01:32:52,975
You said some things
about her in your sleep.

1284
01:32:53,422 --> 01:32:55,070
I... I don't care.

1285
01:32:55,751 --> 01:32:57,323
If you want to get better...

1286
01:32:58,475 --> 01:32:59,957
...you have to.

1287
01:33:06,879 --> 01:33:07,800
She...

1288
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:11,056
She was insane.

1289
01:33:14,872 --> 01:33:15,914
She...

1290
01:33:17,616 --> 01:33:21,503
Charlie, are you gonna
let me help you here?

1291
01:33:24,402 --> 01:33:25,479
Okay.

1292
01:33:26,972 --> 01:33:29,776
Do you remember anything
before you blacked out?

1293
01:33:32,724 --> 01:33:35,234
I remember leaving Sam's house...

1294
01:33:36,082 --> 01:33:38,608
...and walking home and...

1295
01:33:40,484 --> 01:33:42,787
<i>I was in the hospital for awhile.</i>

1296
01:33:44,595 --> 01:33:46,975
<i>I won't go into detail about all of it.</i>

1297
01:33:48,029 --> 01:33:51,011
<i>But I will say there were
some very bad days.</i>

1298
01:33:52,153 --> 01:33:55,054
<i>And some unexpected beautiful days.</i>

1299
01:33:58,123 --> 01:33:59,993
<i>The worst day was the time...</i>

1300
01:33:59,994 --> 01:34:03,926
<i>...my doctor told my mom and
dad what Aunt Helen did to me.</i>

1301
01:34:10,283 --> 01:34:11,759
Honey?

1302
01:34:14,180 --> 01:34:15,773
I'm so sorry.

1303
01:34:30,267 --> 01:34:32,704
<i>The best days were those
when I could have visitors.</i>

1304
01:34:33,149 --> 01:34:35,749
<i>My brother and sister
always came for those...</i>

1305
01:34:35,750 --> 01:34:38,128
<i>...until Chris had to
go to training camp.</i>

1306
01:34:38,768 --> 01:34:40,774
<i>He's going to be first string this year.</i>

1307
01:34:43,322 --> 01:34:46,730
<i>And my sister told me
she met a nice guy at her summer job.</i>

1308
01:34:51,448 --> 01:34:52,553
There he is.

1309
01:34:54,111 --> 01:34:58,578
So, I'll see you Thursday at 6, right?

1310
01:34:59,308 --> 01:35:02,348
<i>My doctor said we can't
choose where we can come from...</i>

1311
01:35:02,383 --> 01:35:04,792
<i>...but we can choose
where we go from there.</i>

1312
01:35:06,358 --> 01:35:07,855
<i>I know it's not all the answers...</i>

1313
01:35:07,856 --> 01:35:11,163
<i>...but it was enough to start
putting these pieces together.</i>

1314
01:35:12,737 --> 01:35:14,868
God bless food
we are about to receive.

1315
01:35:14,869 --> 01:35:17,848
We thank You for this bounty in the
name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

1316
01:35:17,849 --> 01:35:19,917
- Amen.
- Amen.

1317
01:35:28,791 --> 01:35:31,446
So, how do you think the Penguins
are gonna do this year, dad?

1318
01:35:33,662 --> 01:35:35,076
God damn Penguins.

1319
01:35:35,248 --> 01:35:37,574
I think they're allergic
to God damn defense.

1320
01:35:41,301 --> 01:35:43,956
What do the players call a puck again?

1321
01:35:44,146 --> 01:35:45,497
A biscuit.

1322
01:35:45,498 --> 01:35:47,746
Are you sure it's not
a "God damn biscuit?"

1323
01:35:47,747 --> 01:35:49,408
You're cruisin' for a bruisin'.

1324
01:35:49,409 --> 01:35:52,155
Honey, I think we're gonna have
to do a little shopping for you...

1325
01:35:52,156 --> 01:35:53,343
...before you take off, huh?

1326
01:35:53,588 --> 01:35:55,141
I need some books...

1327
01:36:02,790 --> 01:36:04,546
Can Charlie come out and play?

1328
01:36:10,471 --> 01:36:12,772
That first night, we had grilled stickies.

1329
01:36:12,807 --> 01:36:14,152
It was so good.

1330
01:36:14,187 --> 01:36:16,239
You have to visit in the Fall.
We'll have some. Okay?

1331
01:36:16,274 --> 01:36:17,222
Definitely.

1332
01:36:17,223 --> 01:36:21,733
Oh, sorry. Charlie has
a breakdown scheduled for October.

1333
01:36:22,958 --> 01:36:25,042
Well, can I tell you something?

1334
01:36:25,043 --> 01:36:27,194
I've been away for two months.

1335
01:36:27,975 --> 01:36:30,950
It's another world.
And it gets better.

1336
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:34,835
And my roommate Katie
has the best taste in music.

1337
01:36:41,356 --> 01:36:43,124
I found the tunnel song.

1338
01:36:46,168 --> 01:36:47,400
Let's drive.

1339
01:36:51,940 --> 01:36:54,700
<i>I don't know if I will have the
time to write any more letters...</i>

1340
01:36:54,735 --> 01:36:57,617
<i>...because I might be too
busy trying to participate.</i>

1341
01:37:01,086 --> 01:37:03,790
<i>So, if this does end up
being the last letter...</i>

1342
01:37:03,825 --> 01:37:07,752
<i>...I just want you to know that I was in a
bad place before I started high school.</i>

1343
01:37:07,787 --> 01:37:09,513
<i>And you helped me.</i>

1344
01:37:10,528 --> 01:37:12,792
<i>Even if you didn't know
what I was talking about.</i>

1345
01:37:12,827 --> 01:37:14,718
<i>Or know someone who's gone through it.</i>

1346
01:37:15,096 --> 01:37:17,079
<i>It made me not feel alone.</i>

1347
01:37:19,768 --> 01:37:23,421
<i>Because I know there are people who
say all of these things don't happen.</i>

1348
01:37:24,144 --> 01:37:29,073
<i>And there are people who forget what
it's like to be 16 when they turn 17.</i>

1349
01:37:29,768 --> 01:37:32,272
<i>I know these will all
be stories someday.</i>

1350
01:37:32,273 --> 01:37:35,047
<i>And our pictures will
become old photographs.</i>

1351
01:37:35,526 --> 01:37:38,349
<i>And we'll all become
somebody's mom or dad.</i>

1352
01:37:39,620 --> 01:37:43,331
<i>But right now,
these moments are not stories.</i>

1353
01:37:43,715 --> 01:37:47,294
<i>This is happening.
I am here.</i>

1354
01:37:47,662 --> 01:37:48,966
<i>And I am looking at her.</i>

1355
01:37:50,032 --> 01:37:51,888
<i>And she is so beautiful.</i>

1356
01:38:02,208 --> 01:38:03,352
<i>I can see it.</i>

1357
01:38:04,410 --> 01:38:08,189
<i>This one moment when you
know you're not a sad story.</i>

1358
01:38:08,534 --> 01:38:10,389
<i>You are alive.</i>

1359
01:38:11,315 --> 01:38:14,072
<i>And you stand up and see
the lights on buildings...</i>

1360
01:38:14,073 --> 01:38:16,149
<i>...and everything that makes you wonder.</i>

1361
01:38:17,268 --> 01:38:19,618
<i>And you are listening to
that song on that drive...</i>

1362
01:38:19,619 --> 01:38:23,000
<i>...with the people
you love most in this world.</i>

1363
01:38:25,516 --> 01:38:27,946
<i>And in this moment, I swear...</i>

1364
01:38:30,078 --> 01:38:32,054
<i>...we are infinite.</i>
