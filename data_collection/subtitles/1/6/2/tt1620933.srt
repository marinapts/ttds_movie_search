1
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:49,967
Pan Singh has killed 9 people

2
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:53,844
He took his brother's vengeance and
police can't do anything

3
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:55,336
What police will do?

4
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:08,325
Give the cigarette

5
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:17,558
Hold it!

6
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,635
How did you get this attitude?

7
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,006
You looks so angry

8
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,037
You haven't seen my attitude

9
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:28,870
Read tomorrow's newspaper
If I my photo didn't pubish

10
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:30,947
then feed me with a dog

11
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:33,883
You have joined Pan Singh Group

12
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:34,815
How do you know that?

13
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:36,748
Don't tell anyone

14
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,144
He is journalist
Yes!

15
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:02,440
You didn't tell anyone?
No!

16
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,778
He is a solider

17
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:06,618
He is very panctual

18
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,620
Till the job done your kid will
stay with us

19
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,462
You stay here with your uncle

20
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,030
I will be back in few minutes,
I will get you some sweets

21
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:28,598
You show them a picture

22
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:31,475
Take care of her

23
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:35,473
Keep it

24
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:42,850
My kid will be fine
It depends on your intentions

25
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,752
Journalist is here

26
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,694
I am taking out my copy

27
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,630
You were putting your hand in the
pocket like you will take out the bomb

28
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:11,532
I am sitting downstairs

29
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,655
Sit here!

30
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,255
You have any problem to sit
on the floor

31
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:31,790
You are younger than me

32
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:42,934
You are Major Chauhan's nephew

33
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,572
He is my uncle
Why you didn'tjoin the army

34
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:52,308
I like to writing

35
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:54,777
If I will have your blessing then
one day

36
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:57,051
I will become a famous journalist

37
00:05:57,223 --> 00:06:00,056
It's not a hard working job that's
why you are so fat

38
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,222
From tomorrow take a run of 4 k.m.

39
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:11,897
Say properly from tomorrow
From tomorrow

40
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,169
Shall we start?

41
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:25,683
How did you become dacoit?

42
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,795
You have become complete journalist
or you are on training

43
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,359
You are from this area and
you didn't know

44
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:45,737
Only Rebels are in Bihar
Dacoits are in Parliment

45
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:49,636
It's over

46
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,003
I am sorry

47
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,657
When did you pick up the gun for
the first time

48
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,099
English people leave this country

49
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,762
After that

50
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,631
Pandit Jee became a Prime Minsiter

51
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:28,814
And along with Free India I have
started my carrier

52
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,747
He is my son

53
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,815
He joined the army

54
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,263
That's why I am telling you I didn't
forgot anyone

55
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:22,057
You should have think about
your wife

56
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,133
Shall I get something to eat or
you will just asking questions to me

57
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:44,382
Let me help you
Leave it

58
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:47,921
I am addicted to live alone

59
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,454
Don't spoil my habit
If you're addicted so I'll go back

60
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:55,095
Go! Here you will go and I will
jump into the wall

61
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:12,873
You are sitting here

62
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,078
You run so fast

63
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:17,517
like a cock

64
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,005
Show me your face

65
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:00,022
You also thought that I am dead

66
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,900
Why you are saying like that?

67
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:06,800
I have showed your fortune

68
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:11,274
Priest said that you are not gonna
stay a single place longer

69
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:13,202
I knew that...

70
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:18,113
Whatever it takes but you will
must come back to me

71
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:27,017
It's Army not a government office that
you will join anytime

72
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:28,925
How did you came late 2 days?

73
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,028
My mom was sick

74
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,863
I had to get marry

75
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,498
Army first then family

76
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:35,431
And what about you?

77
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,867
My fields were prepared
How could I leave that

78
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:39,865
So I won't let you stand

79
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:42,404
Get your bags and take 10 rounds

80
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,454
10 Rounds are over

81
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,052
You think I am a fool

82
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:05,523
I ran little fast and I have no
problem to run

83
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:07,997
I will see,
Take another 10 Rounds

84
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,135
With or without luggage

85
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,208
Your name Rakesh!

86
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:28,049
Who is he?

87
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:30,044
He is new recruit Pan Singh Tomar

88
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,993
I can see for the first time that
someone is enjoying his punishment

89
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:45,901
It's 37 rupees

90
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,901
How would you spend a month
in 2 rupees

91
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,042
Military is looking after me

92
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,438
My wife got a daughter
Congratulations!

93
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,343
Now I will have to look after her

94
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,185
You live for eating or you eat
for living

95
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,224
We have food for living

96
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,125
and poison for eating

97
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:16,525
Want some?

98
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,709
It's Betallion not a wedding

99
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:27,411
Meal is fixed you will
kill everyone with hunger

100
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,139
What should I do if I my diet is
like that

101
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,250
Join Sports they have no problem
for food

102
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,429
British left two good things for us

103
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:49,399
Discipline

104
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,531
and Second Ice cream

105
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:53,171
I have ordered for you

106
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,970
Ice cream will be melt down when
I will reach home

107
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,550
Take me in sports
I've heard they have food problem

108
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:09,278
What do you play?

109
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:11,556
I can play anything in fact
I run so fast

110
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:15,056
What is that?

111
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,264
Take this icecream to his house
without melting down

112
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:22,125
and you will be in sports,
Give me the address

113
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,703
Major has send it

114
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,235
You can check it's not
melted down

115
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:09,476
what's the time?
It's 9

116
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,048
Tell him that you have got
it in 4 minutes

117
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:44,073
Not to read mantras but I shoot
to run

118
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,085
He was the man who brought
icecream in 4 minutes

119
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,660
Congratulation!
You are on second position

120
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,828
But he says he wants to join sports
for food

121
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:43,202
He is not such interested in sports

122
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:10,266
My dad fought with british and he
sent me here to join Military

123
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,292
to serve my country

124
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,536
I can't use the gun

125
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:23,445
Why you can't fire a bullet

126
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:25,407
Hold it on your shoulder close
your one eye

127
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:27,481
Take aim pull the trigger and
bullet is fired

128
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:28,776
What's going on here?

129
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,516
He is new in army and I am
teaching him firing

130
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:35,416
He is new and you were
born here

131
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,625
I have old relationship
with the gun

132
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,392
Then show me your aim

133
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:54,340
Get up!

134
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,407
Where you from?

135
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:02,852
Chambal!

136
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:05,455
Dacoit's Area
Not dacoit but rebel

137
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,350
My uncle is a rebel

138
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:09,288
He have respect

139
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:11,361
Police couldn't arrest him till yet

140
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,735
You have told that your uncle
is a dacoit

141
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,403
Not dacoit he is a rebel

142
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:22,269
He is a nice person

143
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,309
Only Answer the question

144
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:29,337
It's not in records

145
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:32,440
But have you ever been imprisoned
for some crime

146
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:34,351
Nor me nor my uncle

147
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,014
Police couldn't arrest him

148
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:40,290
What did I said?

149
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,353
Only answer the question

150
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,319
Do you believe in Government

151
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:47,424
Government is a theif

152
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,526
that's why I joined the army

153
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:54,668
In this country except army everyone
is a thief

154
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,304
Can you sacrify your life
for the country?

155
00:17:58,911 --> 00:17:59,935
Yes and I can take life

156
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,841
Country is like our mom

157
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,813
and if somebody will try to hert my
mom so I won't sit quite

158
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:08,816
Army means discipline

159
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:13,488
You will have to obey your
senior's orders

160
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:15,693
Will you obey any order?

161
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:19,464
I am fourth standard failed

162
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,431
I have read man more than books

163
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,569
Now an officer like you will
give the order

164
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:26,768
then I will put my life

165
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,612
Few officers are bettallion are useless

166
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,977
Now if they will give me the orders
then I will have to think about it

167
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,081
Sir!
I will talk to him

168
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,620
I still have doubt

169
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,395
Did I say something wrong

170
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:00,568
You wait outside

171
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,341
Have you seen his attitude

172
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,414
His uncle is a Rebel

173
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:15,076
Army officers are useless

174
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:20,588
I have an idea

175
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:24,421
We will send him to Army Physical
Training Centre

176
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:26,462
He will run over there

177
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:28,557
And his entire anger will come
out to the land

178
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,563
We should use his hot temper

179
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,537
You haven't seen him running

180
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:51,882
Did you take bath?

181
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:01,396
Did you finish your Warm-up?

182
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,994
I will do it

183
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,940
Let's start the race

184
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:05,391
You will always be illetrate
You didn't learn anything in city

185
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,324
Breaking records mean...

186
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:11,065
First position in race

187
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:15,463
How do I know?

188
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,117
Leave me!
What are you doing?

189
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:43,262
Now they are sending me to foriegn

190
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:45,432
Tokyo Japan

191
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:49,273
And Asia's famous Athletes are
coming there

192
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,473
What should I bring you
from tokyo

193
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,575
You are going abroad

194
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,260
When you run in shorts

195
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:15,627
I really don't like that

196
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:17,496
All women looks at you

197
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,594
But they won't allow me to run
in pents

198
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,529
And what if I will bring a lady

199
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:27,275
then where will you jump down
because there is no well here

200
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:30,405
I will lay down on railway track

201
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:32,780
What if I will kill you

202
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:37,510
Is it necessary to wear?
Yes it is...

203
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:41,240
Long iron rods are under these shoes
how would I run?

204
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:42,443
These are called spikes

205
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:47,247
India's Athletes will run
without spikes

206
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:50,892
Then why you didn't gave on
practice time

207
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,759
Now you are telling me wear them and
run in competition

208
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:57,301
So what World will say that India
doesn't have shoes for it's Athletes

209
00:33:57,902 --> 00:33:59,426
Look at other countries athletes

210
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:01,265
What should I see?
They got lot of food to eat

211
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:02,903
They got all the facilities

212
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:04,798
You gave me two eggs and said
bring the medal

213
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:07,369
What are you trying to say?
I have said less but assume it more

214
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:10,713
Don't try to be a leader
Wear these shoes

215
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:12,315
take God's name and get ready

216
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:14,442
You will must win

217
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:45,871
And that day I lost that race

218
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:48,575
I still have regret for that

219
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:49,776
It always will be

220
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,642
My shoes took my respect

221
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:13,529
I don't understand anything
You deal with her

222
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:16,430
What's your name?

223
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:35,581
She loves you

224
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,905
He brought lot of dirty clothes

225
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:56,071
He didn't bring the medal

226
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,050
Once I felt I should stay there

227
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:02,780
then what stopped you?
Your breads...

228
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:05,722
I don't know what she will feed me

229
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,583
You just missed my breads...

230
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:14,894
They are not going anywhere

231
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:16,562
Both of you sit here

232
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:22,736
I am telling you they are
not going anywhere

233
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,059
Don't be hurry to give your
measurements take your time

234
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:32,633
I have put my kids on job

235
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:37,239
You really decide to bring that
Japanese girl here

236
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:41,584
You don't like my races but she
loved me racing

237
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:50,620
What are you doing?

238
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:01,933
Time has come

239
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:05,602
to show your courage

240
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:10,772
and to sacrify on your country what
any soldier waiting for

241
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:16,919
Which body we have made steel

242
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:19,882
time has come to use it

243
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:25,220
They have started the war but
we will win this war

244
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,666
And we took swear of this land

245
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:32,133
Before giving our lives

246
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,831
We will take ten enemies lives and
we will become a martyr

247
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:09,199
What happen?

248
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:12,341
Why are you shouting this morning?
What's this?

249
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:13,570
Soils are ours and how did
you get it

250
00:50:16,913 --> 00:50:17,607
It's stealing

251
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:19,609
Since when you have become
a police officer

252
00:50:23,553 --> 00:50:25,384
Nor soils are your nor fields

253
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:26,486
It's mine

254
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:30,918
Take any legal action

255
00:50:32,262 --> 00:50:34,423
Look! Don't talk about legal actions

256
00:50:34,598 --> 00:50:35,997
that's not good for anyone

257
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:39,633
That's my field give it
back to me

258
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:42,567
I am the owner of that land

259
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:45,331
I gave money to Matha Deen

260
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:46,942
He sold his own fields

261
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:55,380
So he sold his own fields
that's my fields

262
00:50:55,852 --> 00:50:57,547
We had a partition in fields

263
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:04,894
Go to the Munciple office and find out
who is the owner

264
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:07,554
Call any court

265
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:12,596
If I will get angry then I will kill
you here and decide it

266
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:14,763
What will you decide?

267
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:21,537
Tell me what will you decide?

268
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:30,318
Don't show me your guns I have
seen many guns

269
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:54,901
I am Pan Singh speaking

270
00:51:57,714 --> 00:51:59,011
Nothing is good

271
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:00,705
I am in trouble

272
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,783
Me relatives snatched my soils

273
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:06,318
It's been two years

274
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:10,890
Your brother is a collector tell
him to make a call

275
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:12,016
He is lying

276
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:14,363
Land is on my name

277
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:15,954
He was a labour on that land

278
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:18,465
It's written on papers that
who is lying

279
00:52:19,402 --> 00:52:21,870
Matha Deen must sold his land
but I didn't

280
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:24,972
He gave money to munciple officer

281
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,507
and he transferred the entire
land on his name

282
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:28,344
Entire land is mine

283
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:30,543
But you and Bhanwar Singh
are relatives

284
00:52:31,948 --> 00:52:32,812
We are cousins

285
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,007
that's why he is still breathing

286
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:37,749
You are also still breathing for
that reason

287
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:56,505
Bhanwar Singh's problem
didn't solved yet

288
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,607
That's why he came here
He will solve this case right now

289
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:02,909
You are a soldier
Country needs you

290
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:05,103
You shouldn't die for nothing

291
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,876
Collector is sitting here
Show some respect to him

292
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:17,859
After checking Pan Singh's papers
it seems that land is his property

293
00:53:19,563 --> 00:53:21,087
And you have so many lands

294
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,662
Why are you fighting for small land?

295
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:26,458
Finish this matter...

296
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:34,932
They have seven licensed guns and
my family is in danger

297
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:38,843
Until the judgement didn't come take
the custody of his guns

298
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:41,443
I came here for Masam's call

299
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:44,952
You solve this issue by your self

300
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:47,821
You can do it

301
00:53:48,124 --> 00:53:49,716
They are becoming brave with guns

302
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:52,862
You're a soldier and afraid from guns
Fight with me hand to hand

303
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:55,795
It's Chmaba's blood

304
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:02,599
Your dad never went to war

305
00:54:02,706 --> 00:54:04,469
If you like to fight a war

306
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:09,067
We have a huge family and if we
all pee together

307
00:54:10,046 --> 00:54:10,910
then you will sink down

308
00:55:52,215 --> 00:55:54,843
Why are you breaking your own hands
to beat him

309
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:56,618
Shoot him and the matter is over

310
00:55:57,053 --> 00:55:58,020
Leave him!

311
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:01,817
If his father will do something
What will he do?

312
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:06,288
He will go to police station

313
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:10,265
His father knows only one thing

314
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:11,698
Running!

315
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:15,066
If he would have courage

316
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:18,037
then he wouldn't carry a gun
in these years

317
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:22,744
Tomorrow we will kill Pan Singh
in his own house

318
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:25,605
Entire village should know...

319
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:45,633
Stay here!

320
00:56:46,936 --> 00:56:49,700
Your blood has become water
How long it will run

321
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:52,741
If you don't want then I will
teach him lesson today

322
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:55,670
Drop your gun here
Nothing will happen with this gun

323
00:56:57,147 --> 00:56:59,342
My son's blood won't come back

324
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:02,317
What about our respect

325
00:57:04,854 --> 00:57:05,912
We won't kill anyone

326
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:12,318
Army assume us country's saviour

327
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:14,795
Police will listen to us

328
00:57:26,743 --> 00:57:28,677
What's the proof that you are
the same person

329
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:38,853
Who is chasing who?

330
00:57:39,722 --> 00:57:41,713
Nobody is chasing anyone

331
00:57:42,158 --> 00:57:44,649
It's a race of 3000 metres

332
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:48,920
It's the toughest race

333
00:57:54,437 --> 00:57:56,928
What's the proof?
Here is the proof

334
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:58,068
It's me

335
00:58:13,857 --> 00:58:17,156
Why people wear short clothes
in foriegn country?

336
00:58:19,796 --> 00:58:21,855
You must have enjoyed that view

337
00:58:22,265 --> 00:58:26,395
Tell me how did you go there?
From train or plane?

338
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:29,895
How do I tell you?
My son is in danger

339
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:33,742
I have won many medals...
I have served this country

340
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:34,902
I was a National Champion

341
00:58:39,749 --> 00:58:42,445
Now nobody is listening to me

342
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:48,288
We don't deal in land case

343
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:50,990
until few people won't die

344
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:52,325
What we will do there

345
00:59:04,007 --> 00:59:06,373
I am telling you that they have
beaten my son alot

346
00:59:06,976 --> 00:59:08,409
He is bleeding

347
00:59:08,912 --> 00:59:11,847
and he can't move
But he is still breathing

348
00:59:14,183 --> 00:59:15,275
He didn't die yet

349
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:17,043
When he will die then I
should come

350
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:22,316
I have run useless races for country
So you got the medals

351
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:56,381
Yourjob is to protect the citizens

352
00:59:58,127 --> 00:59:59,560
Not to make breads on dead bodies

353
01:06:30,377 --> 01:06:32,402
Mom is calling you
She is not feeling well

354
01:06:57,971 --> 01:06:59,632
I told you to escape
Now police will kill you

355
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,101
We all will be trap
Everybody listen to me

356
01:07:03,410 --> 01:07:05,708
It's Pan Singh Tomar's Gang

357
01:07:06,013 --> 01:07:07,878
My vengeance is not completed yet

358
01:07:08,515 --> 01:07:10,540
I have not got peace yet

359
01:07:10,651 --> 01:07:12,380
I will be back

360
01:07:14,955 --> 01:07:17,014
Game has just begin

361
01:07:20,093 --> 01:07:21,492
Why you talk like illetrate people

362
01:07:22,696 --> 01:07:24,789
Surrender yourself, finish your
punishment and join coaching here

363
01:07:27,868 --> 01:07:28,994
I should come tomorrow

364
01:07:29,970 --> 01:07:31,130
But after me...

365
01:07:31,939 --> 01:07:34,806
They won't spare my family

366
01:07:37,177 --> 01:07:39,839
Only we both know what's my
relationship with sports

367
01:07:40,514 --> 01:07:41,446
or God knows...

368
01:07:42,115 --> 01:07:44,481
How police will understand it

369
01:07:45,185 --> 01:07:47,517
They have got another Rebel
to discuss in beer bar

370
01:07:52,893 --> 01:07:54,485
He is my nephew

371
01:07:55,162 --> 01:07:56,561
He is innocent

372
01:07:57,497 --> 01:07:59,556
If he will join the army

373
01:08:00,033 --> 01:08:01,466
Why don't you take him to
your gang?

374
01:08:01,835 --> 01:08:03,598
Nobody wants to be a Rebel

375
01:08:04,171 --> 01:08:05,536
We will never meet again

376
01:08:12,212 --> 01:08:13,770
You will get our news

377
01:08:17,117 --> 01:08:19,950
He is a noble man he can't kill a fly

378
01:08:20,487 --> 01:08:21,078
How could he kill a man

379
01:08:24,891 --> 01:08:26,586
Listen to me

380
01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:33,891
We will spare you

381
01:08:36,837 --> 01:08:39,704
Just tell us that where is Pan Singh

382
01:08:41,842 --> 01:08:43,173
He is lying

383
01:08:44,211 --> 01:08:45,644
Make him sit on stick

384
01:08:50,617 --> 01:08:54,815
I am asking you for the last time
tell me where is Pan Singh

385
01:09:02,296 --> 01:09:04,560
What should I tell you?
What happened with us?

386
01:09:09,202 --> 01:09:11,136
Police can arrest us anytime

387
01:09:11,605 --> 01:09:12,629
to ask your whereabouts

388
01:09:13,974 --> 01:09:15,532
Where do we go?

389
01:09:17,277 --> 01:09:19,575
We have arranged few
police uniforms

390
01:09:21,281 --> 01:09:24,114
When uncle was looking for you so
you were having fun

391
01:09:24,618 --> 01:09:27,018
And now police caught you so
you came here

392
01:09:27,654 --> 01:09:29,519
Now Uncle should get you in army

393
01:09:29,890 --> 01:09:31,653
Take us in your gang

394
01:09:33,593 --> 01:09:34,924
If you will become a rebel so
you will die

395
01:09:35,696 --> 01:09:36,993
We won't live there

396
01:09:45,706 --> 01:09:48,675
Have you ever eat hot Ghulab Jamun
in ice cream

397
01:09:50,744 --> 01:09:51,711
I never taste it before

398
01:10:12,666 --> 01:10:13,633
Pick up the bowl

399
01:10:17,204 --> 01:10:19,638
I also have that ice cream what
British made

400
01:10:20,841 --> 01:10:24,004
but the best icecream is made
by Germany

401
01:10:43,330 --> 01:10:44,797
You came to city after so long

402
01:10:45,165 --> 01:10:46,154
that's why you didn't know

403
01:10:49,669 --> 01:10:51,762
So all relatives made a gang

404
01:10:59,813 --> 01:11:00,711
How much is that?

405
01:11:16,997 --> 01:11:19,158
Where did you get the weapons?
We buy them

406
01:11:52,799 --> 01:11:55,962
She will only sing,
Extra charge for other things

407
01:12:05,712 --> 01:12:06,838
You go there

408
01:12:11,751 --> 01:12:13,981
Make an atmosphere I will
just bring the money

409
01:12:42,883 --> 01:12:44,043
Give it back to her

410
01:12:44,951 --> 01:12:46,248
Don't do cheap things

411
01:12:46,753 --> 01:12:48,744
What will you do with this money?

412
01:12:53,994 --> 01:12:55,427
Inform his family members

413
01:12:58,064 --> 01:13:01,363
that we need 125000 cash and if they
will informm the police

414
01:13:03,470 --> 01:13:05,028
then your son won't be alive

415
01:13:13,914 --> 01:13:17,350
Tell Gowardhan to inform his family

416
01:13:20,353 --> 01:13:21,377
You sit here

417
01:13:24,190 --> 01:13:27,057
What are you doing?
If he will try to escape

418
01:13:28,828 --> 01:13:30,455
He can't run faster than me

419
01:13:32,999 --> 01:13:34,091
Put him on some work

420
01:13:34,501 --> 01:13:37,197
He won't get meal for free
Make him cook for entire gang

421
01:13:42,576 --> 01:13:44,237
You have made it wrong

422
01:14:05,599 --> 01:14:08,261
Did you arrange the money?
I have put my all efforts

423
01:14:10,103 --> 01:14:12,162
You will get your son for 125000

424
01:14:13,106 --> 01:14:16,098
I can't arrange more than that

425
01:14:17,143 --> 01:14:19,907
Put your tears of 50000

426
01:14:20,513 --> 01:14:23,914
If Pan Singh will be emotional so
he will spare your son

427
01:14:24,618 --> 01:14:27,519
Now everything is in your hand

428
01:14:33,093 --> 01:14:34,822
That won't work

429
01:14:35,261 --> 01:14:37,252
You will have to make river
of your tears

430
01:14:51,578 --> 01:14:54,069
Remember that Pan Singh
shouldn't be angry

431
01:14:55,382 --> 01:14:57,475
Otherwise I am not responsible of you
and your son

432
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:08,923
I couldn't arrange 125000

433
01:15:09,596 --> 01:15:12,326
I have sold my house and I could
arrange only 75000

434
01:15:13,033 --> 01:15:14,466
You can search my house

435
01:15:17,237 --> 01:15:19,899
We know he is very clever

436
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:21,871
Look I am a Rebel not a
businessman

437
01:15:22,142 --> 01:15:24,975
Give me what you have and you son
will come home after one week

438
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:28,504
If you will inform the police

439
01:15:29,516 --> 01:15:32,883
How could I dare to inform the police

440
01:15:43,697 --> 01:15:45,221
May I tell him where I get
you from?

441
01:15:50,270 --> 01:15:51,931
He was watching dance and I got
him from there

442
01:26:59,638 --> 01:27:01,629
You didn't pay your duty

443
01:27:01,941 --> 01:27:04,341
I am a Rebel and I didn't forgot
my duty

444
01:27:05,177 --> 01:27:07,270
You are a statue ofjustice

445
01:27:09,081 --> 01:27:10,878
I have small kids

446
01:27:16,756 --> 01:27:17,814
Here is your uniform

447
01:27:20,626 --> 01:27:23,652
Now if you will ever wear this uniform

448
01:27:24,063 --> 01:27:26,258
then I will kill you

449
01:27:27,366 --> 01:27:28,628
You are not good for this uniform

450
01:27:50,222 --> 01:27:53,316
Uniform! Please forgive me
You are not good to appologize it

451
01:27:58,697 --> 01:27:59,857
Now go from here

452
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:22,414
Where are you running?

453
01:29:08,234 --> 01:29:09,929
You can't run faster than me

454
01:29:13,839 --> 01:29:14,703
Now tell me

455
01:29:17,776 --> 01:29:20,074
Where are your protectors?

456
01:29:21,113 --> 01:29:22,910
And where is your licensed gun?

457
01:29:30,489 --> 01:29:32,218
I have such a small land

458
01:29:34,426 --> 01:29:37,884
Please forgive me

459
01:29:38,130 --> 01:29:40,724
Take your land back and take mine too

460
01:29:41,834 --> 01:29:44,064
Please forgive me

461
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:55,869
What my mom has done with you?

462
01:29:56,916 --> 01:29:58,508
You have beaten her with
your gun

463
01:30:01,253 --> 01:30:03,915
You have beaten my old mom
with your gun

464
01:30:13,499 --> 01:30:14,830
I won't die with a single bullet

465
01:30:16,502 --> 01:30:19,869
Let me go!
I don't have shortage of bullets

466
01:30:20,806 --> 01:30:21,795
or my aim is bad

467
01:30:30,249 --> 01:30:32,376
I am an International Athlete

468
01:30:33,452 --> 01:30:36,080
Please forgive me
What mistake I have done

469
01:30:38,857 --> 01:30:41,018
that you have snatched my playground

470
01:30:43,195 --> 01:30:46,164
And you people have made me
carry this gun

471
01:30:46,999 --> 01:30:48,796
Now I am running in Chambal

472
01:30:56,442 --> 01:30:59,002
Who will answer that question?

473
01:31:24,336 --> 01:31:25,496
I know to run

474
01:31:27,006 --> 01:31:29,304
I will run my entire life

475
01:31:52,931 --> 01:31:55,923
Why you are always in hurry?

476
01:31:58,303 --> 01:32:00,897
We are discussing our problems here

477
01:32:02,541 --> 01:32:03,200
And you have killed him

478
01:32:04,977 --> 01:32:05,966
Drop your guns

479
01:32:15,587 --> 01:32:17,487
I will come up and ask the question

480
01:32:23,929 --> 01:32:25,897
My vengeance has completed

481
01:32:27,533 --> 01:32:30,502
But your enemies are over in Bihar
but not enmity

482
01:32:32,638 --> 01:32:34,128
And one day we got an incident

483
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:37,540
that's why I am telling you
my story

484
01:32:54,026 --> 01:32:57,052
You gave me respect for believing in me

485
01:32:57,196 --> 01:33:00,654
Your arrangements are great and this
village is also good

486
01:33:01,066 --> 01:33:03,057
Whenever I pass from here I came here

487
01:33:06,138 --> 01:33:08,936
Gang is so big and police is everywhere
I don't wanna be a burden on you

488
01:33:09,641 --> 01:33:11,404
If you will stop respecting us then...

489
01:33:16,115 --> 01:33:19,607
I have heard that police is
on petrolling

490
01:33:21,754 --> 01:33:25,190
Until petrolling is not over we
will stay here

491
01:34:08,333 --> 01:34:10,198
Have it!
It's very sweet

492
01:34:14,773 --> 01:34:17,571
Don't call Raam's name either he
shouldn't come to get you

493
01:35:36,255 --> 01:35:38,485
You go from here
I won't let you die

494
01:35:38,824 --> 01:35:42,260
I am finished,
I will take you out from here

495
01:45:58,910 --> 01:46:00,275
Did you ever run in race?

496
01:46:03,081 --> 01:46:04,912
Race has a rule

497
01:46:06,351 --> 01:46:07,818
Once race has started

498
01:46:09,387 --> 01:46:10,877
then whatever your position is

499
01:46:12,090 --> 01:46:13,887
You will have to finish the race

500
01:46:15,026 --> 01:46:18,257
Finish line is so far away

501
01:46:21,332 --> 01:46:22,822
you will have to touch it

502
01:46:26,771 --> 01:46:29,763
So I will finish my race whether I
win or lose

503
01:46:31,075 --> 01:46:32,133
You know your race

504
01:46:43,021 --> 01:46:44,818
What's the important thing that
you have to go

505
01:46:45,790 --> 01:46:48,088
I am missing him so I thought
I should go and meet him

506
01:46:49,894 --> 01:46:52,829
You are going alone I am not
feeling good

507
01:46:52,931 --> 01:46:55,024
Police is searching me in Bihar so
I am going to the city

508
01:46:58,436 --> 01:46:59,869
And police is searching for
entire gang

509
01:47:01,205 --> 01:47:03,264
that's why it's not good for us
to stay together

510
01:47:05,009 --> 01:47:06,533
Everyone make a group of 3-4 persons

511
01:47:07,111 --> 01:47:07,839
and get seperated

512
01:47:10,915 --> 01:47:12,940
We will meet after one month

513
01:47:17,188 --> 01:47:18,155
Except your gang member

514
01:47:19,891 --> 01:47:20,915
don't trust anyone

515
01:47:37,008 --> 01:47:37,906
It's height is so high

516
01:47:40,011 --> 01:47:41,979
Pan Singh practiced on this height

517
01:48:03,034 --> 01:48:04,399
I am notjust your papa

518
01:48:12,310 --> 01:48:14,904
You are looking like a soldier
You looks week

519
01:48:16,614 --> 01:48:17,478
I am getting old

520
01:48:20,118 --> 01:48:21,585
I have heard that you are
getting married

521
01:48:29,661 --> 01:48:30,559
I have seen the girl

522
01:48:31,462 --> 01:48:34,295
She have four brothers...
You have any problem with my name

523
01:48:35,099 --> 01:48:36,066
They are agreed with this marriage
because of you

524
01:48:38,102 --> 01:48:40,400
In their family nobody's photo has
published in newspapers

525
01:48:42,206 --> 01:48:43,867
My defammed worked for you

526
01:48:48,079 --> 01:48:49,979
How is your mom?
She is worried about you

527
01:48:51,983 --> 01:48:54,543
I thought I have come to meet you so
I should send a message to her

528
01:49:26,050 --> 01:49:28,075
You will have a problem to
meet me

529
01:49:29,053 --> 01:49:30,145
If you are scared then I will leave

530
01:49:36,294 --> 01:49:38,228
You surrender yourself

531
01:49:40,331 --> 01:49:43,027
You have no other choice

532
01:49:43,568 --> 01:49:46,036
You mean I should admit that
I made a mistake

533
01:49:47,205 --> 01:49:48,399
and now you will forgive me

534
01:49:50,341 --> 01:49:53,037
and I should renounce a surrender
rebel all my life

535
01:49:55,513 --> 01:49:58,573
Why don't you ask them a question
who made us rebel

536
01:50:00,051 --> 01:50:02,485
First they should surrender then
I will surrender

537
01:50:11,062 --> 01:50:11,619
I am leaving now

538
01:50:16,100 --> 01:50:16,998
I am taking this photo

539
01:50:42,226 --> 01:50:44,023
Why did you came here?

540
01:50:45,196 --> 01:50:47,027
I just came here to see your anger

541
01:50:48,599 --> 01:50:50,999
Who knows I will get a chance
again or not

542
01:50:53,337 --> 01:50:55,134
I was missing everything...

543
01:51:21,132 --> 01:51:24,067
So what's your priest said to
see my horoscope

544
01:51:24,702 --> 01:51:26,192
He said you will surrender

545
01:51:27,638 --> 01:51:28,798
Your priest is a fake

546
01:51:31,676 --> 01:51:32,802
Do you know the meaning
of surrender

547
01:51:34,111 --> 01:51:36,238
Your priest is fake he just said
it to make you happy

548
01:51:39,383 --> 01:51:42,186
You don't worry it's just for a while

549
01:51:42,186 --> 01:51:43,175
everything will be fine

550
01:51:45,256 --> 01:51:46,245
When you will come again?

551
01:51:50,695 --> 01:51:51,753
Will you surrender?

552
01:51:52,096 --> 01:51:54,121
Your priest meant to surrender
something else

553
01:51:54,765 --> 01:51:56,596
And sooner or later everyone
will have to surrender

554
01:52:18,155 --> 01:52:18,814
Fetch me some water

555
01:52:22,159 --> 01:52:23,786
Caste is nothing

556
01:52:25,263 --> 01:52:26,855
Human should help another human

557
01:52:36,274 --> 01:52:38,105
You never says wrong

558
01:52:44,415 --> 01:52:47,248
Gopi is in Pan Singh gang his
in laws are here

559
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:50,350
Did he came here?

560
01:52:51,355 --> 01:52:54,449
Yes he used to come here
He is coming in wedding here

561
01:52:57,795 --> 01:52:59,160
Let me meet him if he will come again

562
01:53:02,199 --> 01:53:03,632
That will be better for both of us

563
01:53:04,168 --> 01:53:06,261
Get a police job for my son

564
01:53:06,404 --> 01:53:07,632
then it will be better for me

565
01:53:10,241 --> 01:53:11,435
You have said it and it's done

566
01:53:18,783 --> 01:53:20,444
Job is important
It should be done soon

567
01:53:22,253 --> 01:53:23,345
It will be done

568
01:53:33,798 --> 01:53:35,823
You really worried about me

569
01:54:07,565 --> 01:54:09,294
I am telling you let's go
to Rajhistan

570
01:54:09,467 --> 01:54:11,230
Why do you love Rajhistan?

571
01:54:11,602 --> 01:54:12,569
Do you have any keep there

572
01:54:14,338 --> 01:54:15,805
We will cross the border and
go to U. P

573
01:54:16,507 --> 01:54:17,940
What's wrong to stay for a while

574
01:54:18,309 --> 01:54:19,333
Are you tired?

575
01:54:19,844 --> 01:54:22,335
I have got some sweets
Let's have it and leave

576
01:54:27,785 --> 01:54:28,581
You eat first

577
01:54:29,754 --> 01:54:31,312
Not this one
Eat this one

578
01:54:44,468 --> 01:54:46,493
I have got it from the wedding

579
01:54:50,474 --> 01:54:52,408
A strong party came from the village

580
01:54:54,045 --> 01:54:55,876
No! We will have to wait
for few days

581
01:55:10,361 --> 01:55:13,956
People should not be worried because
Pan Singh gang has scared from police

582
01:55:14,665 --> 01:55:16,030
It's published in newspapers

583
01:55:18,569 --> 01:55:19,331
Party is strong?

584
01:55:20,037 --> 01:55:22,028
Wedding will be on next saturday

585
01:55:28,546 --> 01:55:30,377
Listen to me we should
go to Rajhistan

586
01:55:33,384 --> 01:55:35,284
But we won't be scared from
the police

587
01:55:44,829 --> 01:55:46,353
Can we trust your in laws...
