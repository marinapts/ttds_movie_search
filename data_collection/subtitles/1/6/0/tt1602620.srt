1
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,547
This is the fire brigade.
Is anybody here?

2
00:01:14,638 --> 00:01:16,549
Please wait outside.

3
00:01:17,238 --> 00:01:19,194
What's the date of the last letter?

4
00:01:19,478 --> 00:01:21,230
The 9th, as far as I can see.

5
00:01:48,598 --> 00:01:50,156
The door is open!

6
00:01:52,758 --> 00:01:55,034
...no as far as I know.
During the whole time, they had a nurse,

7
00:01:55,035 --> 00:01:57,309
but it's been a while since I last
saw her. My wife has been...

8
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:05,948
- Did you open the window?
- No.

9
00:02:15,078 --> 00:02:18,832
LOVE

10
00:03:02,838 --> 00:03:05,796
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to
the Thtre des Champs Elyses.

11
00:03:05,918 --> 00:03:09,035
We ask you to turn off
your mobile phones.

12
00:03:09,158 --> 00:03:13,151
and remind you that all forms of video
and audio recordings are prohibited.

13
00:03:13,398 --> 00:03:15,707
We hope you enjoy the concert.

14
00:05:07,078 --> 00:05:11,868
They used a screwdriver or something
similar. Doesn't look very professional.

15
00:05:11,998 --> 00:05:14,512
- But who would do something like that?
- No idea.

16
00:05:14,678 --> 00:05:18,193
Why someone would try to break in?
Because he wants to steal something.

17
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,149
- From us?
- Why not?

18
00:05:20,358 --> 00:05:24,397
If I come to think about it
three or four people we know

19
00:05:24,518 --> 00:05:25,712
have already been burgled.

20
00:05:25,838 --> 00:05:27,715
What time is it?
Can't we call the caretaker?

21
00:05:27,838 --> 00:05:29,453
I'll do that tomorrow morning.

22
00:05:29,692 --> 00:05:32,192
Don't let this put a damper
on your good mood.

23
00:05:34,638 --> 00:05:38,108
- Or call the police?
- Come, give me your coat.

24
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:49,754
Imagine if we were lying in bed
and somebody broke in.

25
00:05:49,878 --> 00:05:52,267
Why should I imagine such a thing?

26
00:05:52,398 --> 00:05:55,390
It's terrible.
I think I would die of fright.

27
00:05:55,518 --> 00:05:56,951
I would too.

28
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:01,470
- Shall we have a drink?
- I'm tired.

29
00:06:02,998 --> 00:06:05,034
I fancy another drink.

30
00:06:05,518 --> 00:06:06,951
Do as you please.

31
00:06:08,878 --> 00:06:11,233
Matilda told me
that in her building

32
00:06:11,358 --> 00:06:14,191
burglars entered the top floor
through the attic.

33
00:06:14,798 --> 00:06:16,714
They simply knocked
a hole into the wall,

34
00:06:16,814 --> 00:06:19,621
cut the most valuable paintings
out of their frames

35
00:06:20,022 --> 00:06:22,527
and disappeared
without leaving a trace.

36
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:24,828
That's how professionals do it.

37
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:33,630
Did I tell you that I thought
you looked very pretty tonight.

38
00:06:33,758 --> 00:06:35,191
What's gotten into you?

39
00:06:43,358 --> 00:06:47,397
The semiquavers in the presto
were incredible. What subtlety!

40
00:06:48,398 --> 00:06:49,877
Don't you think?

41
00:06:50,678 --> 00:06:52,236
You're proud of him, huh?

42
00:07:16,758 --> 00:07:17,907
What's the matter.

43
00:07:20,998 --> 00:07:22,317
Nothing.

44
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:27,630
Next week?

45
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:29,593
No. Yes.

46
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,911
No, but it would be better to fix this
as soon as possible.

47
00:07:33,318 --> 00:07:36,833
It might give people silly ideas.

48
00:07:37,198 --> 00:07:39,314
And anyway, it's ugly to look at.

49
00:07:40,678 --> 00:07:41,872
At what time?

50
00:07:43,398 --> 00:07:45,832
Yes, okay.
All right.

51
00:07:46,798 --> 00:07:48,948
Will you also bring
the varnish with you?

52
00:07:51,678 --> 00:07:54,033
But at least some primer.

53
00:07:54,358 --> 00:07:56,792
Yes, okay.
Excellent.

54
00:07:57,838 --> 00:07:58,873
Yes.

55
00:07:59,678 --> 00:08:02,351
Well, thank you.
Goodbye. Thank you.

56
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:07,078
- He's reliable.
- I hope so.

57
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:10,914
The last time he kept us
waiting for ages, if you remember.

58
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:12,551
Yes, that's true.
Thank you.

59
00:08:14,838 --> 00:08:18,672
But if I call a regular company, they
let us wait for at least two months.

60
00:08:19,078 --> 00:08:20,113
Oh yeah?

61
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,557
The Frodons had to wait for three days
when their toilet was clogged.

62
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:35,830
Not exactly pleasant.

63
00:08:39,078 --> 00:08:40,750
The salt cellar is empty.

64
00:08:54,758 --> 00:08:58,273
I don't know if he's going
to bring us the CD today.

65
00:08:58,798 --> 00:09:00,789
Maybe he won't come at all.

66
00:09:02,318 --> 00:09:06,072
We could go to Virgin
this afternoon and buy it.

67
00:09:06,998 --> 00:09:08,113
What do you say?

68
00:09:12,798 --> 00:09:14,117
What's going on?

69
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,509
What's the matter?
Anne?

70
00:09:20,438 --> 00:09:21,473
Cuckoo.

71
00:09:22,918 --> 00:09:23,907
I'm here

72
00:09:25,838 --> 00:09:26,629
Anne.

73
00:09:28,118 --> 00:09:29,551
What's going on?

74
00:09:33,718 --> 00:09:36,357
Anne, what's going on?

75
00:09:41,638 --> 00:09:42,787
What's the matter?

76
00:10:22,758 --> 00:10:23,907
Anne...

77
00:10:30,398 --> 00:10:32,229
Anne, darling, please.

78
00:10:32,358 --> 00:10:35,873
Anne, look at me.
What's the matter?

79
00:10:38,558 --> 00:10:39,877
What's the matter?

80
00:11:30,238 --> 00:11:31,193
Anne?

81
00:11:55,438 --> 00:11:56,473
What are you doing?

82
00:11:57,038 --> 00:11:58,869
You left the water running.

83
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:02,153
Hey, what's wrong with you?
Are you completely crazy?

84
00:12:03,678 --> 00:12:06,067
- Is this a joke?
- What?

85
00:12:06,198 --> 00:12:09,873
Is this a joke?
Is this supposed to be a joke?

86
00:12:09,998 --> 00:12:12,387
What joke?
I don't get it.

87
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:15,792
Why do you talk to me in that tone?
What has gotten into you?

88
00:12:16,878 --> 00:12:19,312
Please, Anne, stop this game,
it's not funny.

89
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:22,157
What game, for Christ's sake?
What's the matter?

90
00:12:30,398 --> 00:12:32,070
Why did you not react?

91
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:34,632
- To what?
- To what? Uh, to everything, to me.

92
00:12:34,758 --> 00:12:36,953
- When?
- Just now. A moment ago.

93
00:12:38,398 --> 00:12:40,787
Please, tell me, what's wrong.

94
00:12:42,118 --> 00:12:43,676
I don't know what to say.

95
00:12:43,838 --> 00:12:47,387
You really don't remember
what just happened?

96
00:12:47,998 --> 00:12:49,875
But what did happen?

97
00:12:53,078 --> 00:12:56,627
You were sitting there,
staring into space

98
00:12:56,758 --> 00:12:59,750
and you didn't answer
when I asked you what the matter was.

99
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:06,111
I took this towel and put it
on your face but you didn't react.

100
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:09,429
Look, there's still dampness
on your collar.

101
00:13:15,238 --> 00:13:17,194
And when... when was it?

102
00:13:17,318 --> 00:13:19,878
Just now, a couple of minutes ago.

103
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,397
- So?
- So? There's no "so".

104
00:13:23,518 --> 00:13:27,636
I went into the bedroom to get dressed.
I wanted to get help.

105
00:13:27,758 --> 00:13:29,111
- Help?
- Yes.

106
00:13:29,478 --> 00:13:31,389
But then you turned off the tap.

107
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,392
Yes, because you left it on.

108
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:40,352
I don't understand.

109
00:13:41,718 --> 00:13:42,594
Me neither.

110
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:46,916
I should call Dr. Bertier.

111
00:13:47,038 --> 00:13:49,916
- Why? What can he do?
- I don't know. Examine you.

112
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,869
I am fine, I am fine.

113
00:13:53,598 --> 00:13:55,156
Please, Anne.

114
00:13:55,518 --> 00:13:58,874
It's absurd, we cannot go on
as if nothing had happened.

115
00:13:58,998 --> 00:14:01,307
But what did happen?

116
00:14:01,878 --> 00:14:04,153
I'm sitting here, having breakfast

117
00:14:04,478 --> 00:14:07,038
and you're telling me things
I don't understand.

118
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:11,670
Can you explain to me
how the tea towel got here?

119
00:14:11,798 --> 00:14:12,674
No.

120
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:15,638
- Who turned the tap on?
- You did.

121
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:19,792
- Oh, you remember that?
- No.

122
00:14:21,358 --> 00:14:23,110
Do you want to torture me?

123
00:14:23,518 --> 00:14:25,110
Leave me in peace.

124
00:14:27,718 --> 00:14:30,073
Don't you think
I'd better call Dr. Bertier?

125
00:14:30,198 --> 00:14:31,153
No!

126
00:15:18,478 --> 00:15:19,359
You know how he is.

127
00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:21,968
Once he's got something into his head,
he has to go through with it.

128
00:15:22,478 --> 00:15:24,867
In the end
everyone was delighted.

129
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:27,075
Besides, it didn't hurt
our financial situation.

130
00:15:28,038 --> 00:15:31,633
So, we're playing until the 28th,
then we have a ten-day break

131
00:15:31,918 --> 00:15:36,309
then we go to Stockholm for four days
and then to Kuhmo in Finland.

132
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:38,992
I don't know where that is.
At the North Pole.

133
00:15:39,878 --> 00:15:42,392
Geoff has already been there a few times,
he loves it.

134
00:15:42,678 --> 00:15:45,146
We're playing the "Dowland
Transcriptions" there.

135
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,188
Then we return to London.

136
00:15:49,478 --> 00:15:50,957
What about the children?

137
00:15:52,758 --> 00:15:58,594
Liz is at her boarding school
and John lives his own life. He's 26.

138
00:16:01,038 --> 00:16:02,471
What does he do?

139
00:16:04,918 --> 00:16:07,990
He works.
He is very independent.

140
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,471
We rarely see him.

141
00:16:12,758 --> 00:16:14,430
A bit like Geoff.

142
00:16:15,358 --> 00:16:17,235
They don't really get along.

143
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:22,596
Geoff wants to advise him on everything.
John doesn't like that at all.

144
00:16:24,038 --> 00:16:26,677
- Is he good?
- Yes, I think so.

145
00:16:28,638 --> 00:16:31,835
He is less impulsive,
but very industrious.

146
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,630
This sounds rather depreciatory.

147
00:16:34,758 --> 00:16:36,953
No. He's just not like Geoff.

148
00:16:37,518 --> 00:16:38,837
He is...

149
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:43,713
calm, but stubborn.
I think he'll do all right.

150
00:16:44,798 --> 00:16:48,552
The other day he played the solo part
of the Haydn concerto

151
00:16:48,678 --> 00:16:51,511
at the conservatoire's last concert.

152
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:52,872
It was very good.

153
00:16:54,038 --> 00:16:57,155
Geoff was there
and he congratulated him at the end.

154
00:16:59,558 --> 00:17:00,547
And you?

155
00:17:02,638 --> 00:17:03,627
What do you mean?

156
00:17:06,758 --> 00:17:08,316
Did you both make up?

157
00:17:08,918 --> 00:17:11,716
Oh, you know him.

158
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:18,633
In September, he discovered his love
for a violinist,

159
00:17:18,758 --> 00:17:21,033
who had been in our ensemble
for many years.

160
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:23,627
What can I tell you?

161
00:17:23,758 --> 00:17:26,795
It was a huge drama.
She tried to commit suicide.

162
00:17:26,918 --> 00:17:30,991
That scared him.
He returned to me, devoured by remorse.

163
00:17:33,798 --> 00:17:36,266
I've got used to it by now, but...

164
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:39,470
I feel embarrassed because
the whole ensemble knows about it.

165
00:17:41,918 --> 00:17:43,033
Do you love him?

166
00:17:44,478 --> 00:17:45,706
Yes, I think so.

167
00:17:53,798 --> 00:17:55,629
What about the surgery?

168
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:01,348
What do you want me to explain?

169
00:18:01,518 --> 00:18:03,156
They made a test,

170
00:18:03,278 --> 00:18:07,032
said the carotid artery was blocked
and that surgery would be necessary.

171
00:18:08,318 --> 00:18:10,036
She was scared.

172
00:18:10,638 --> 00:18:13,550
Totally confused, frightened.

173
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:17,511
You know
she's always been afraid of doctors.

174
00:18:18,838 --> 00:18:23,247
They said the risk was very low
and that if they didn't operate,

175
00:18:23,547 --> 00:18:28,177
she'd be certain
to have another, more serious stroke.

176
00:18:28,918 --> 00:18:30,909
And what do they say now?

177
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:33,589
That it didn't go well.

178
00:18:36,518 --> 00:18:39,316
It's one of the 5% that go wrong.

179
00:18:48,078 --> 00:18:50,308
It's pretty upsetting.

180
00:18:52,438 --> 00:18:55,191
Usually at this time, I take a nap.

181
00:18:56,638 --> 00:18:59,755
My blood sugar
is somewhere down in my socks.

182
00:19:02,078 --> 00:19:04,911
- I'm so sorry.
- Yes.

183
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,918
- What can I do for you?
- Nothing.

184
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:17,396
It was very nice of you to come
despite all of your stress.

185
00:19:19,118 --> 00:19:21,757
No, honestly,
there's nothing you can do.

186
00:19:22,038 --> 00:19:25,713
We'll see how things go
when she's back here in the apartment.

187
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,630
We'll manage all right.

188
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:32,232
Maybe I'll hire a home health aide,

189
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:35,711
maybe I'll manage on my own.
We'll see.

190
00:19:38,118 --> 00:19:41,394
We've been through a lot together,
your mother and I.

191
00:19:43,398 --> 00:19:45,832
All this is still a bit new.

192
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:51,933
It's funny. I don't know if I should
tell you as it might embarrass you

193
00:19:52,113 --> 00:19:53,484
but when I came in earlier

194
00:19:53,624 --> 00:19:56,882
I remembered how I always used to listen
to the two of you making love as a child.

195
00:19:58,878 --> 00:20:00,311
This always reassured me.

196
00:20:00,918 --> 00:20:03,034
It gave me a feeling
that you loved each other

197
00:20:03,158 --> 00:20:05,194
and that we'd always be together.

198
00:20:10,638 --> 00:20:12,629
- Watch your fingers!
- Yeah.

199
00:20:48,158 --> 00:20:50,388
Put this next to the window.
Thank you.

200
00:20:50,518 --> 00:20:51,553
Certainly, sir.

201
00:20:53,478 --> 00:20:54,706
Sorry.

202
00:21:00,998 --> 00:21:03,228
- This is for both of you.
- Thank you.

203
00:21:03,358 --> 00:21:05,588
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

204
00:21:08,358 --> 00:21:09,552
Thank you, Mr. Mry.

205
00:21:09,678 --> 00:21:12,715
If you need anything,
just call downstairs.

206
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:15,716
- If we can help you in one way or another...
- Right now everything's fine.

207
00:21:15,838 --> 00:21:19,274
I'll let your wife know
as soon as we need anything.

208
00:21:19,798 --> 00:21:22,107
Good to have you back,
Mrs. Laurent.

209
00:21:22,398 --> 00:21:24,673
Yes, thank you, Mr. Mry.
Thank you.

210
00:21:25,078 --> 00:21:27,956
If... If you need anything...

211
00:21:28,118 --> 00:21:29,551
Yes, thank you.

212
00:21:30,118 --> 00:21:34,111
Goodbye then, ma'am.
Welcome home again.

213
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:38,314
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye, Mr. Mry, thank you.

214
00:21:50,198 --> 00:21:51,790
Where do you want...

215
00:21:52,158 --> 00:21:53,432
In the living room.

216
00:22:30,158 --> 00:22:31,830
Shall I make some tea?

217
00:22:31,998 --> 00:22:34,193
First come sit with me.

218
00:22:55,158 --> 00:22:58,673
- Can you help me into the arm chair?
- Yes, of course.

219
00:22:59,598 --> 00:23:00,997
Come closer.

220
00:23:01,478 --> 00:23:04,356
Put your knees against mine
so I don't slip.

221
00:23:05,438 --> 00:23:07,906
Put your right arm around me.

222
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:10,515
And lift me up.

223
00:23:11,438 --> 00:23:12,871
And up!

224
00:23:32,758 --> 00:23:33,747
Here.

225
00:23:59,238 --> 00:24:01,468
I'm so glad you're back.

226
00:24:03,078 --> 00:24:04,397
So am I.

227
00:24:13,238 --> 00:24:15,547
- Promise me one thing.
- What?

228
00:24:17,158 --> 00:24:20,230
Please never take me back
to the hospital.

229
00:24:21,798 --> 00:24:22,594
What?

230
00:24:24,478 --> 00:24:25,911
You promise?

231
00:24:27,558 --> 00:24:29,708
- Anne...
- You promise?

232
00:24:31,918 --> 00:24:33,670
- Anne, I'm...
- Don't talk right now.

233
00:24:35,118 --> 00:24:38,667
Don't give me any lectures.
Please.

234
00:24:41,318 --> 00:24:43,957
- What can I say?
- Nothing.

235
00:24:45,478 --> 00:24:46,831
Just don't say anything.

236
00:24:48,998 --> 00:24:50,033
Okay?

237
00:25:10,278 --> 00:25:11,552
Thank you.

238
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:16,471
Thank you, dear.

239
00:25:20,878 --> 00:25:23,438
- Everything fine?
- Everything is fine.

240
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:28,677
You don't have to hold my hand
all the time.

241
00:25:28,878 --> 00:25:31,346
I can look after myself,
you know.

242
00:25:32,318 --> 00:25:34,957
And don't feel guilty.
That would be pointless.

243
00:25:35,078 --> 00:25:37,797
And a drag for me too.

244
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:41,598
- I don't feel guilty.
- That's good.

245
00:25:44,158 --> 00:25:45,671
Go over there now.

246
00:25:46,438 --> 00:25:48,156
I'm not a cripple.

247
00:25:49,558 --> 00:25:53,392
You can easily leave me alone
for two minutes. I won't collapse.

248
00:25:54,398 --> 00:25:55,353
Okay.

249
00:25:57,678 --> 00:26:00,317
Did you buy the new book
on Harnoncourt?

250
00:26:00,758 --> 00:26:02,908
- I've already read it.
- And?

251
00:26:03,358 --> 00:26:05,474
Do you want it?
Shall I get it for you?

252
00:26:05,758 --> 00:26:07,032
Please do.

253
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:18,994
I don't know where I put it.

254
00:26:19,518 --> 00:26:22,635
- Don't worry. It's not that important.
- Yes it is.

255
00:26:23,478 --> 00:26:27,073
I think I left it...

256
00:26:32,358 --> 00:26:33,871
Ah, here it is!

257
00:26:34,878 --> 00:26:37,312
Nothing like an infallible memory!

258
00:26:42,398 --> 00:26:45,117
I thought I had left it
in the small bedroom

259
00:26:45,958 --> 00:26:50,793
but I had already put it away.
Tidy people just can't help being tidy.

260
00:26:52,038 --> 00:26:53,187
Thank you.

261
00:26:56,798 --> 00:26:59,676
Good, now do something for yourself.

262
00:27:00,358 --> 00:27:04,556
Don't stay here to see
how I hold the book, okay?

263
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:05,674
Okay.

264
00:27:10,038 --> 00:27:12,029
I'll leave the door open.

265
00:28:17,438 --> 00:28:19,998
Unfortunately the strawberries
were already moldy.

266
00:28:20,678 --> 00:28:24,114
I'll go and get you some fresh ones
tomorrow morning from the market.

267
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:30,111
My husband will bring you
the Evian water this afternoon.

268
00:28:30,318 --> 00:28:32,593
I'm not supposed to carry anything
heavy. My back, you know.

269
00:28:32,718 --> 00:28:33,992
No problem.

270
00:28:36,678 --> 00:28:40,990
It came to 76.40.
Here's the receipt.

271
00:28:42,518 --> 00:28:45,874
- Your change, 23.60.
- Keep the small change.

272
00:28:46,118 --> 00:28:47,597
Thank you, sir.

273
00:28:49,718 --> 00:28:53,677
Well, I'll be going then.
Call me if you need anything.

274
00:28:53,838 --> 00:28:55,112
I will.

275
00:29:01,358 --> 00:29:04,987
- Is your wife doing well?
- Yes. She's recovering.

276
00:29:05,318 --> 00:29:07,957
That's good.
Give her my regards.

277
00:29:08,598 --> 00:29:11,192
My husband and I are very glad
she's back.

278
00:29:11,318 --> 00:29:13,229
Yes, we are too.

279
00:29:13,758 --> 00:29:15,589
Goodbye, Mrs. Mry, thank you.

280
00:29:15,718 --> 00:29:17,709
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

281
00:29:23,398 --> 00:29:27,630
I'll bring you the strawberries
tomorrow around noon, if that suits you.

282
00:29:27,758 --> 00:29:29,510
Yes, fine.
Thank you.

283
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:42,028
- Can you come here, please.
- Yes.

284
00:31:23,718 --> 00:31:29,350
Some banal love story about a nobleman
and a lower middle class girl

285
00:31:29,478 --> 00:31:30,578
who can't marry

286
00:31:30,741 --> 00:31:33,987
and who then, out of sheer magnanimity,
renounce their love for each other.

287
00:31:35,958 --> 00:31:38,916
In fact, I don't remember the story.

288
00:31:39,678 --> 00:31:44,194
In any case, I remember that I was
completely shaken up when I went out

289
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:46,753
and that I needed some time
to calm down.

290
00:31:46,878 --> 00:31:47,833
Thank you.

291
00:31:50,518 --> 00:31:53,021
In the courtyard of the house
where grandma lived,

292
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:57,074
there was a young guy at the window
who asked me where I'd been.

293
00:31:57,678 --> 00:31:59,603
He was a few years older than me.

294
00:32:00,078 --> 00:32:04,310
He was a show-off
who of course really impressed me.

295
00:32:05,158 --> 00:32:07,069
"To the cinema", I said to him.

296
00:32:07,398 --> 00:32:11,789
Because I was very proud grandma had given
me money to go all alone to the cinema.

297
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:14,551
"What did you watch?"

298
00:32:14,998 --> 00:32:17,193
I started to tell him the story

299
00:32:17,678 --> 00:32:21,751
and as I did,
all the emotion came back.

300
00:32:22,518 --> 00:32:27,387
I didn't want to cry in front of this
guy, but it was impossible.

301
00:32:27,638 --> 00:32:33,235
There I was, in tears in the courtyard,
and I told him the drama till the end.

302
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:41,432
So? How did he react?

303
00:32:42,918 --> 00:32:46,194
No idea.
He probably laughed at me.

304
00:32:46,878 --> 00:32:48,391
I don't remember.

305
00:32:48,838 --> 00:32:54,071
I don't remember the film either.
But I remember the feelings.

306
00:32:55,238 --> 00:32:57,115
I was ashamed to cry.

307
00:32:58,638 --> 00:33:02,472
But telling him the story made
all my feelings and tears come back,

308
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:05,915
maybe even stronger than
when I was actually watching the film.

309
00:33:06,518 --> 00:33:08,315
I just couldn't stop.

310
00:33:08,838 --> 00:33:11,796
That's sweet.
Why have you never told me this?

311
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:16,075
There are still many stories
I've never told you.

312
00:33:19,118 --> 00:33:23,396
Don't tell me you're going to ruin
your image in your old age?

313
00:33:23,838 --> 00:33:25,430
You bet I won't.

314
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:27,831
But what is my image?

315
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:34,229
Sometimes you're a monster.

316
00:33:36,278 --> 00:33:37,313
But you're nice.

317
00:33:39,478 --> 00:33:41,275
Can I get you another drink?

318
00:33:44,478 --> 00:33:45,513
Five.

319
00:33:48,718 --> 00:33:50,117
Six.

320
00:33:52,998 --> 00:33:54,226
Seven.

321
00:33:56,598 --> 00:33:57,747
Eight.

322
00:34:00,118 --> 00:34:01,437
Nine.

323
00:34:04,158 --> 00:34:05,307
Ten.

324
00:34:06,478 --> 00:34:09,117
Up to fifteen.
Eleven.

325
00:34:12,358 --> 00:34:13,586
Twelve.

326
00:34:15,958 --> 00:34:17,357
Thirteen.

327
00:34:18,638 --> 00:34:20,117
Fourteen.

328
00:34:21,798 --> 00:34:22,833
And fifteen.

329
00:34:26,838 --> 00:34:28,954
- You're okay?
- I'm okay.

330
00:34:36,758 --> 00:34:39,556
Listen to this.
My horoscope.

331
00:34:40,758 --> 00:34:43,875
Motto: You have lots of verve,
but need to be more serious!

332
00:34:44,598 --> 00:34:49,069
Love: High-class conversation
is what you need.

333
00:34:49,518 --> 00:34:54,546
Work: You're motivated again.
But proceed with care.

334
00:34:55,038 --> 00:35:01,034
Health: Loosen up by doing exercises.
It'll give you renewed pizzazz.

335
00:35:02,718 --> 00:35:06,233
You've got only yourself to blame
if you read this nonsense.

336
00:35:10,398 --> 00:35:12,958
Tomorrow afternoon
is Pierre's funeral.

337
00:35:13,918 --> 00:35:15,556
You've got to go.

338
00:35:16,238 --> 00:35:19,947
I fear I must.
Though I don't want to go at all.

339
00:35:20,638 --> 00:35:23,198
Few people like to go to funerals.

340
00:35:23,318 --> 00:35:25,149
Oh, I know a few people who do.

341
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:29,832
Annette, for instance,
cannot wait to get all dressed up.

342
00:35:30,318 --> 00:35:32,957
- And Franois, this idiot...
- You're mean.

343
00:35:33,198 --> 00:35:35,792
What would you say
if no one came to your funeral?

344
00:35:37,398 --> 00:35:39,389
Nothing, presumably.

345
00:35:43,678 --> 00:35:48,708
Have you talked to Jeanne
since I went to the hospital?

346
00:35:51,198 --> 00:35:52,790
Does she knows I can't come?

347
00:35:52,958 --> 00:35:54,869
Yes.
Of course.

348
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,552
What did she say?

349
00:35:57,798 --> 00:36:00,232
- She was in shock.
- In what way?

350
00:36:00,718 --> 00:36:04,427
I don't know. What are people like
when they're shocked?

351
00:36:04,798 --> 00:36:07,995
She was speechless,
she couldn't believe it.

352
00:36:08,798 --> 00:36:11,790
I don't know, well, not precisely.

353
00:36:12,118 --> 00:36:14,586
You know I've spoken
to a lot of people since.

354
00:36:16,878 --> 00:36:17,833
I'm sorry.

355
00:36:19,598 --> 00:36:20,747
No.

356
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:24,750
Please forgive me.
I didn't mean to be unkind.

357
00:36:25,798 --> 00:36:29,427
But what's the point
of talking about it all the time.

358
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:31,914
Do I talk about it all the time?

359
00:36:32,318 --> 00:36:33,273
No.

360
00:36:35,118 --> 00:36:36,233
I'm sorry.

361
00:36:46,718 --> 00:36:47,673
What...

362
00:37:30,758 --> 00:37:34,637
Why are you back already?
What time is it?

363
00:37:56,918 --> 00:37:59,478
Forgive me, I was too slow.

364
00:38:00,598 --> 00:38:03,237
- Anne...
- Can you wheel me into the living room?

365
00:38:06,678 --> 00:38:07,554
Yes.

366
00:38:52,638 --> 00:38:55,516
You're always good at surprises.

367
00:38:56,038 --> 00:38:56,993
Yes.

368
00:38:58,918 --> 00:39:00,829
Why did you come home earlier?

369
00:39:00,958 --> 00:39:03,791
I didn't come home earlier.
I took a taxi.

370
00:39:04,198 --> 00:39:06,428
On Saturdays
there's not a lot of traffic.

371
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:08,113
That's true.

372
00:39:11,038 --> 00:39:12,630
How was the funeral?

373
00:39:12,758 --> 00:39:14,032
Anne...

374
00:39:18,478 --> 00:39:21,072
How was it?
Come on, tell me!

375
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:48,910
It was rather bizarre.

376
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:53,509
The priest was an idiot.

377
00:39:55,678 --> 00:40:00,274
A former colleague of Pierre's
came to make a speech

378
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,276
that was embarrassingly emotional.

379
00:40:04,758 --> 00:40:09,593
His former secretary
came with a mini cassette player

380
00:40:09,878 --> 00:40:12,108
and put on "Yesterday" by the Beatles.

381
00:40:12,798 --> 00:40:14,197
You can't imagine.

382
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:17,108
Everybody turned round
to look at her.

383
00:40:17,598 --> 00:40:19,953
Obviously, it was not planned.

384
00:40:20,678 --> 00:40:22,714
Pierre's grandchildren were there.

385
00:40:22,958 --> 00:40:27,236
Of course, they giggled
as soon as the music began.

386
00:40:27,638 --> 00:40:28,753
Then

387
00:40:28,878 --> 00:40:32,791
the urn was put on a huge stretcher

388
00:40:33,078 --> 00:40:36,548
that was obviously
designed for a coffin,

389
00:40:37,038 --> 00:40:38,994
and we went out into the rain.

390
00:40:39,798 --> 00:40:43,154
They placed the urn
on a small electric cart

391
00:40:43,438 --> 00:40:45,713
that crawled along
for what seemed like an eternity

392
00:40:45,958 --> 00:40:48,426
to the small hole
that they had dug.

393
00:40:49,518 --> 00:40:51,474
Many people got the giggles.

394
00:40:52,798 --> 00:40:54,629
It must have been terrible for Jeanne.

395
00:40:54,758 --> 00:40:57,875
There's no point in going on living.
That's how it is.

396
00:41:00,078 --> 00:41:02,638
I know it can only get worse.

397
00:41:03,478 --> 00:41:07,710
Why should I inflict this on us,
on you and me?

398
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:12,070
You're not inflicting anything on me.

399
00:41:13,238 --> 00:41:15,627
You don't have to lie, Georges.

400
00:41:24,158 --> 00:41:26,228
Put yourself in my place.

401
00:41:27,278 --> 00:41:30,793
Didn't you ever think
that it could happen to me too?

402
00:41:30,918 --> 00:41:32,317
Of course, I did.

403
00:41:33,238 --> 00:41:36,674
But imagination and reality
have little in common.

404
00:41:37,598 --> 00:41:40,988
- But things are getting better every day.
- I don't want to carry on.

405
00:41:42,198 --> 00:41:45,668
You're making such sweet efforts
to make everything easier for me.

406
00:41:45,798 --> 00:41:47,231
But I don't want to go on.

407
00:41:47,758 --> 00:41:49,589
For my own sake.
Not yours.

408
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:53,035
I don't believe you.
I know you.

409
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:56,267
You think you are a burden to me.

410
00:41:56,878 --> 00:41:59,756
But what would you do
in my place?

411
00:41:59,918 --> 00:42:03,547
I don't want to rack my brain
over this.

412
00:42:03,878 --> 00:42:07,427
I'm tired, I want to go to bed.

413
00:43:24,358 --> 00:43:26,918
Hello.
Nice to see you.

414
00:43:27,398 --> 00:43:29,116
I'm sorry to descend upon you like this.

415
00:43:29,238 --> 00:43:31,468
I tried many times to call you
but to no avail.

416
00:43:31,598 --> 00:43:35,113
I'm sorry. I only pick up the phone
when I've stored the caller's number

417
00:43:35,238 --> 00:43:36,671
and I know who's calling.

418
00:43:36,878 --> 00:43:38,231
But come on in.

419
00:43:39,438 --> 00:43:42,396
I was so sorry that I couldn't manage
to come by after the concert.

420
00:43:43,158 --> 00:43:45,547
I was so pleased that you came.

421
00:43:46,158 --> 00:43:47,432
Come with me.

422
00:43:48,078 --> 00:43:50,069
Yesterday my agent called me.

423
00:43:50,238 --> 00:43:52,354
Actually I'm goning to record
an album in June

424
00:43:52,478 --> 00:43:55,754
and I had to pick a location,
a piano.

425
00:43:55,958 --> 00:43:59,348
So I flew into Paris this morning,

426
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:02,567
and once I was at my hotel, I thought,
I'll just give it a try and drop in.

427
00:44:02,826 --> 00:44:03,746
It's just around the corner.

428
00:44:03,938 --> 00:44:05,371
Very nice.

429
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:09,557
- This is for your spouse.
- Thank you.

430
00:44:10,078 --> 00:44:13,354
- Isn't she home?
- Yes she is. I'll get her in a minute.

431
00:44:13,478 --> 00:44:16,151
- Have a seat, please.
- I hope I'm not disturbing you.

432
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:19,714
No, not at all. I'm very happy
to see you. Have a seat.

433
00:44:21,518 --> 00:44:25,557
We were so thrilled by your concert,
my wife and I.

434
00:44:26,198 --> 00:44:28,473
We hoped we'd see you again soon.

435
00:44:28,838 --> 00:44:31,750
Can I can get you something?

436
00:44:31,998 --> 00:44:33,829
- A cup of tea?
- No, thank you.

437
00:44:35,918 --> 00:44:39,593
I'll just put the flowers in a vase
and tell her that you are here.

438
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:40,987
I'll be right back.

439
00:45:39,198 --> 00:45:43,032
Alexandre, I'm delighted.
How lovely to see you!

440
00:45:43,918 --> 00:45:47,149
Mrs. Laurent!
Lovely to see you too.

441
00:45:47,278 --> 00:45:48,677
Don't get up.

442
00:45:49,438 --> 00:45:50,507
Come on, sit down.

443
00:45:51,398 --> 00:45:53,229
And don't look so serious.

444
00:46:07,518 --> 00:46:09,270
I'm really proud of you.

445
00:46:10,718 --> 00:46:13,073
We were both in raptures
after your concert.

446
00:46:13,198 --> 00:46:17,157
Georges wanted to buy your new CD
the very next morning.

447
00:46:17,278 --> 00:46:21,271
Oh my God! I wanted to bring you one
but then I completely forgot about it.

448
00:46:21,398 --> 00:46:23,787
I left in such a hurry.

449
00:46:25,118 --> 00:46:28,588
- I'll get one today and drop it by.
- No, no, don't worry.

450
00:46:28,998 --> 00:46:33,514
We want to contribute to your success,
even it's only 20 euro.

451
00:46:33,798 --> 00:46:37,586
You have already contributed a lot.
I owe you so much, ma'am.

452
00:46:39,238 --> 00:46:41,798
You owe it to your hard work
and your talent.

453
00:46:43,438 --> 00:46:46,874
Do you remember, when you first gave me
the "Bagatelles" to play?

454
00:46:47,758 --> 00:46:48,793
I was 12 years old.

455
00:46:50,478 --> 00:46:54,517
And in my youthful arrogance
I asked you: "But why the 'Bagatelles'?"

456
00:46:54,758 --> 00:46:58,512
Don't you remember? That day, you really
gave me a piece of your mind.

457
00:47:01,798 --> 00:47:03,470
What has happened to you?

458
00:47:05,678 --> 00:47:07,748
My right side is paralyzed, that's all.

459
00:47:07,878 --> 00:47:09,630
This can happen when you get older.

460
00:47:10,918 --> 00:47:11,987
And how...

461
00:47:12,358 --> 00:47:14,667
Let's talk about something else,
if you don't mind.

462
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:15,908
Yes.

463
00:47:16,758 --> 00:47:18,191
Don't be offended.

464
00:47:18,438 --> 00:47:22,226
But I want to enjoy the lovely interlude
you've given us with your visit.

465
00:47:24,038 --> 00:47:25,232
Yes, of course.

466
00:47:26,158 --> 00:47:27,671
You haven't told us yet

467
00:47:27,798 --> 00:47:31,313
what's been going on
since the Paris concert.

468
00:47:31,838 --> 00:47:34,750
Well, I was in London
most of the time.

469
00:47:35,518 --> 00:47:36,997
I performed two concerts in Copenhagen,

470
00:47:37,118 --> 00:47:40,508
that was Schubert too.
The "Impromptu", the "Musical Moments".

471
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:43,677
My whole life revolves
around Schubert at the moment.

472
00:47:43,958 --> 00:47:48,429
Ideally, I would like to record
the complete collection of sonatas.

473
00:47:49,598 --> 00:47:52,351
Though I think I still need
a couple more years for the late ones.

474
00:47:52,478 --> 00:47:55,436
- Could you do me a favor?
- What?

475
00:47:57,278 --> 00:48:00,031
Would play the
"Bagatelle in G Minor" for me?

476
00:48:03,038 --> 00:48:04,949
I haven't played it in a while.

477
00:48:07,598 --> 00:48:09,509
I don't remember it very well.

478
00:48:09,918 --> 00:48:13,035
- If you want, I can give it a try.
- Give it a try.

479
00:48:14,638 --> 00:48:15,707
Okay.

480
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:09,467
What's the matter?

481
00:51:46,398 --> 00:51:47,797
What are you doing?

482
00:51:51,158 --> 00:51:53,228
Have you completely lost your mind?

483
00:51:53,838 --> 00:51:55,430
I can't believe it.

484
00:52:16,078 --> 00:52:17,750
See what you have done.

485
00:52:18,478 --> 00:52:21,834
Can't you call me
if you need something?

486
00:52:22,118 --> 00:52:23,312
I'm sorry.

487
00:52:23,478 --> 00:52:25,673
Yeah, I am too.

488
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:27,587
Sorry.

489
00:52:28,958 --> 00:52:31,267
The lamp is broken, too.

490
00:53:02,318 --> 00:53:03,228
Yes?

491
00:53:06,198 --> 00:53:07,313
Who's there?

492
00:53:44,198 --> 00:53:45,551
Anybody here?

493
00:53:50,558 --> 00:53:51,786
Is there anybody here?

494
00:54:28,358 --> 00:54:31,077
Georges, what's the matter?
What's going on?

495
00:54:32,238 --> 00:54:34,547
Calm down, will you.

496
00:54:40,038 --> 00:54:41,471
What was it?

497
00:54:49,478 --> 00:54:52,390
Eva. They're coming on the 12th.

498
00:54:54,478 --> 00:54:55,593
Why?

499
00:54:56,238 --> 00:55:00,026
No idea.
Apparently, she's coming with Geoff.

500
00:55:01,358 --> 00:55:02,552
When is it?

501
00:55:03,078 --> 00:55:05,797
I don't know exactly.
What day is it today?

502
00:55:07,718 --> 00:55:08,992
I'll go and look.

503
00:55:14,438 --> 00:55:15,666
I don't want that.

504
00:55:17,158 --> 00:55:17,954
What?

505
00:55:18,118 --> 00:55:20,951
Geoff doesn't need to come.
It's not necessary.

506
00:55:24,598 --> 00:55:27,351
I don't need any comments
on my predicament.

507
00:55:28,438 --> 00:55:31,714
I can only take his British humor
in small doses.

508
00:56:55,278 --> 00:56:57,997
Dear Mrs. Laurent
and Mr. Laurent.

509
00:56:58,798 --> 00:57:01,676
It was beautiful
and yet sad to see you.

510
00:57:01,958 --> 00:57:05,075
My heartfelt wishes
that things will get better.

511
00:57:05,198 --> 00:57:09,350
With deepest sympathy,
your former pupil, Alexandre.

512
00:57:28,478 --> 00:57:29,911
Stop the CD.

513
00:58:17,038 --> 00:58:18,790
Where are the photo albums?

514
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:22,472
The photo albums?
I don't know.

515
00:58:23,238 --> 00:58:26,355
In the small bedroom, I think.
Why?

516
00:58:26,838 --> 00:58:28,590
Can you get them for me?

517
00:58:29,318 --> 00:58:30,353
Now?

518
00:58:31,598 --> 00:58:32,951
But why now?

519
00:58:33,278 --> 00:58:34,916
I'd like to look at them.

520
00:58:37,798 --> 00:58:39,072
Please.

521
00:59:10,118 --> 00:59:11,153
Thank you.

522
00:59:12,198 --> 00:59:13,267
You're welcome.

523
01:00:18,838 --> 01:00:19,987
It's beautiful.

524
01:00:20,798 --> 01:00:21,753
What?

525
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:23,512
Life.

526
01:00:26,518 --> 01:00:27,871
So long.

527
01:00:34,358 --> 01:00:35,837
Long life.

528
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,515
Stop watching me.

529
01:00:44,758 --> 01:00:46,510
I wasn't watching you.

530
01:00:48,598 --> 01:00:52,637
Of course you were.
I'm not that dumb yet.

531
01:00:54,118 --> 01:00:57,633
...the focus will be as much
on the how as on the what.

532
01:00:58,118 --> 01:00:59,995
Benjamin Netanyahu,

533
01:01:00,238 --> 01:01:04,629
is finally granted an official visit
with all the honours:

534
01:01:04,878 --> 01:01:09,349
handshake photo,
joint press conference,

535
01:01:09,598 --> 01:01:15,195
conspicuously demonstrating
the renewal of ties between Israel...

536
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:17,390
Israel and the United States.

537
01:02:07,078 --> 01:02:08,397
You're soaked through.

538
01:02:09,998 --> 01:02:12,558
- What do you mean?
- Hang on.

539
01:02:29,478 --> 01:02:30,831
It's no big deal.

540
01:02:51,478 --> 01:02:52,467
Come on.

541
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:11,307
Wait.

542
01:04:04,478 --> 01:04:05,627
Don't get all worked up.

543
01:04:08,518 --> 01:04:10,315
Calm down, calm down.

544
01:04:12,438 --> 01:04:14,043
...thinking about
whether it wouldn't be better

545
01:04:14,294 --> 01:04:15,947
to invest the money
in an apartment block.

546
01:04:17,438 --> 01:04:21,511
If inflation gets going again,
property is the only sure thing.

547
01:04:22,278 --> 01:04:27,113
Right now,
savings accounts pay 1.75% at best.

548
01:04:27,358 --> 01:04:28,996
That's a good rate already.

549
01:04:30,078 --> 01:04:33,275
Four years ago, Geoff bought

550
01:04:33,558 --> 01:04:37,153
shares for a small amount of money,
and the whole thing collapsed.

551
01:04:37,318 --> 01:04:40,788
So now we're obviously worried.

552
01:04:43,078 --> 01:04:44,557
In the meantime,

553
01:04:46,198 --> 01:04:50,191
other people have had the same idea
and property prices are soaring.

554
01:04:54,958 --> 01:04:56,473
Since I came back from Scandinavia,

555
01:04:56,673 --> 01:04:58,907
I spend my spare time
going through the classifieds.

556
01:05:09,078 --> 01:05:10,352
We'll see.

557
01:05:11,438 --> 01:05:14,271
It takes time.
We'll find something in the end.

558
01:05:25,518 --> 01:05:27,634
I have...

559
01:05:29,558 --> 01:05:31,435
the grandmother...

560
01:05:33,798 --> 01:05:37,507
woman with house...

561
01:05:39,398 --> 01:05:40,672
not...

562
01:05:43,398 --> 01:05:44,717
house then...

563
01:05:48,478 --> 01:05:49,831
money...

564
01:05:57,518 --> 01:06:01,033
I'm... Sorry, Mum,
I don't understand you.

565
01:06:01,838 --> 01:06:03,988
I don't understand
what you say.

566
01:06:08,238 --> 01:06:09,353
yes...

567
01:06:09,758 --> 01:06:10,986
straight away...

568
01:06:13,838 --> 01:06:15,271
it's all...

569
01:06:17,358 --> 01:06:19,667
house sel...

570
01:06:21,798 --> 01:06:23,072
sel...

571
01:06:26,758 --> 01:06:30,228
not...
in two strokes...

572
01:06:34,438 --> 01:06:36,269
so quickly...

573
01:06:41,278 --> 01:06:42,427
God...

574
01:06:44,438 --> 01:06:46,156
it's hard...

575
01:06:47,998 --> 01:06:49,431
say...

576
01:06:50,398 --> 01:06:52,628
house sol...

577
01:06:54,198 --> 01:06:56,996
money gone...

578
01:06:59,238 --> 01:07:00,512
gone...

579
01:07:03,718 --> 01:07:09,634
al... so the... the... the... hou... se

580
01:07:10,038 --> 01:07:11,027
Yes.

581
01:07:14,718 --> 01:07:15,992
Whose house?

582
01:07:21,358 --> 01:07:22,313
The house of...

583
01:07:22,438 --> 01:07:25,635
also... grandmother...

584
01:07:26,438 --> 01:07:28,269
grandmother...

585
01:07:51,998 --> 01:07:53,750
Three times a week.

586
01:07:54,118 --> 01:07:57,554
I'm not experienced enough.
We'll see if that's enough.

587
01:07:57,758 --> 01:07:59,396
How much is she asking?

588
01:08:00,038 --> 01:08:03,269
It's paid by the hour.
We'll see.

589
01:08:05,078 --> 01:08:05,849
And her?

590
01:08:06,878 --> 01:08:07,788
Anne?

591
01:08:09,518 --> 01:08:10,917
It's hard to say.

592
01:08:11,038 --> 01:08:15,350
Sometimes I get the feeling she's
totally unaware of the state she's in.

593
01:08:15,478 --> 01:08:17,708
But in the next moment
I feel the opposite.

594
01:08:18,518 --> 01:08:20,031
And what does the doctor say?

595
01:08:20,838 --> 01:08:21,714
He...

596
01:08:26,278 --> 01:08:27,996
She only talks gibberish.

597
01:08:38,638 --> 01:08:40,196
What's going on?

598
01:08:41,358 --> 01:08:43,747
We can't just leave her lying
on her bed like that!

599
01:08:43,878 --> 01:08:46,187
She's unrecognizable!
It's ridiculous!

600
01:08:46,358 --> 01:08:47,880
There's nothing we can do
at the moment.

601
01:08:48,098 --> 01:08:50,492
She's undergoing treatment,
gets medication.

602
01:08:52,278 --> 01:08:54,348
There are no other options
right now.

603
01:08:54,478 --> 01:08:57,515
What does that mean, "no other options"?
Why not put her in the hospital?

604
01:08:58,878 --> 01:09:00,596
She had a second stroke.

605
01:09:01,398 --> 01:09:02,911
Bertier examined her

606
01:09:03,038 --> 01:09:06,792
and felt we could spare her
all the hospital inpatient procedures.

607
01:09:06,958 --> 01:09:09,267
Anyway, they wouldn't keep her.

608
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:12,515
They'd send her to a care home
with nursing.

609
01:09:13,038 --> 01:09:16,110
What they do in those places,
we can do here.

610
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:19,833
And she won't be put in a care home.

611
01:09:21,078 --> 01:09:22,670
I promised her that.

612
01:09:23,878 --> 01:09:26,676
Don't you think
you're taking on too much?

613
01:09:27,078 --> 01:09:28,909
Have you got a better idea?

614
01:09:33,358 --> 01:09:37,988
I can't believe that these days
there is not a more effective treatment.

615
01:09:38,278 --> 01:09:40,633
No one's stopping you
from finding out.

616
01:09:42,638 --> 01:09:46,267
I take it you believe me when I say
I love your mother as much as you do.

617
01:09:46,398 --> 01:09:48,992
So please, don't treat me
as if I was a total idiot

618
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:51,996
incapable of doing the obvious.

619
01:09:52,278 --> 01:09:53,870
I didn't say that.

620
01:09:54,838 --> 01:09:58,194
I'm simply questioning whether what I
see going on here is the best solution.

621
01:09:58,998 --> 01:10:00,670
Don't you want to get
a second opinion?

622
01:10:01,318 --> 01:10:03,149
Stop it, both of you.

623
01:10:03,758 --> 01:10:06,875
Another doctor did come.
He agrees with Bertier.

624
01:10:07,158 --> 01:10:10,099
From Monday, a nurse will come
three times a week.

625
01:10:10,433 --> 01:10:11,581
Is that good enough?

626
01:10:11,849 --> 01:10:14,529
Now can we talk
about something else?

627
01:10:18,238 --> 01:10:19,273
Like what?

628
01:10:20,238 --> 01:10:22,798
a republican awakening by a president

629
01:10:22,918 --> 01:10:25,478
who has secluded himself
in the lyse Palace for the weekend.

630
01:10:25,598 --> 01:10:28,795
He's cancelled everything,
doors are closed, his schedule is empty.

631
01:10:28,918 --> 01:10:32,194
All that's on his mind right now is to
prepare his appearance on France 2.

632
01:10:32,318 --> 01:10:36,106
This appearance will be in the form of
an interview conducted by David Pujadas

633
01:10:36,238 --> 01:10:41,313
because his previous interview in January
was conducted by TF1's Laurence Ferrari.

634
01:10:42,518 --> 01:10:47,973
France Inter will broadcast a special
programme tomorrow between 9 and 10 pm.

635
01:10:49,129 --> 01:10:51,533
where we'll analyse
and comment the interview

636
01:10:51,758 --> 01:10:55,194
...and behind the shoulder. You turn.
And behind the buttocks.

637
01:10:55,358 --> 01:10:58,873
Hold like this, with the elbow.
And we put the nappy on.

638
01:11:01,598 --> 01:11:03,316
Straighten your back.

639
01:11:03,838 --> 01:11:05,317
Straighten it.

640
01:11:05,918 --> 01:11:11,072
Then gently roll back,
straighten your leg.

641
01:11:15,918 --> 01:11:18,512
Could you grap the sheet down there?
I'll help you.

642
01:11:18,718 --> 01:11:20,549
Pull, pull, pull, pull.

643
01:11:20,718 --> 01:11:25,587
Now you pull the diaper.
Like this.

644
01:11:26,638 --> 01:11:27,912
That's it.

645
01:11:29,078 --> 01:11:31,034
And we lie down on the back.

646
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:37,673
And you put the nappy on
and fasten the tapes.

647
01:12:44,078 --> 01:12:46,467
There, my love,
I hope you like it.

648
01:12:46,598 --> 01:12:47,792
Yes, yes.

649
01:13:08,718 --> 01:13:11,437
I added some peach juice.

650
01:13:12,238 --> 01:13:14,149
I find it tastes quite good.

651
01:14:35,118 --> 01:14:38,235
Come on, Anne, my love,
you've only swallowed three mouthfuls.

652
01:15:04,158 --> 01:15:05,068
I'm sorry.

653
01:15:36,118 --> 01:15:39,554
Mum to the concert...

654
01:15:43,598 --> 01:15:44,553
Yes?

655
01:15:47,038 --> 01:15:49,916
Mum to the concert...

656
01:15:53,758 --> 01:15:55,271
No... no dress...

657
01:15:57,518 --> 01:15:59,748
No dress, mum to the concert.

658
01:15:59,878 --> 01:16:02,267
Mum to the concert...

659
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:08,627
No!

660
01:16:12,638 --> 01:16:14,993
I'll also wash the other one.

661
01:16:25,718 --> 01:16:27,788
That's it.
Now we only wash off the soap.

662
01:16:31,038 --> 01:16:33,506
Does the temperature suit you?

663
01:16:34,038 --> 01:16:38,077
No? I'm bending you forward.
Don't be afraid, I'm here.

664
01:16:41,398 --> 01:16:42,717
Very well.

665
01:16:53,398 --> 01:16:58,074
...come from 8 till 12
and I'd do 2 until 6, or 3 to 7.

666
01:16:58,278 --> 01:16:59,757
I'll think about it.

667
01:16:59,878 --> 01:17:01,755
She just has to know in time
so she can plan ahead.

668
01:17:01,878 --> 01:17:04,187
Of course. I'll let you know
in the next few days.

669
01:17:04,438 --> 01:17:06,793
Very well.
I have to go now.

670
01:17:09,078 --> 01:17:11,672
- Thanks for the coffee.
- My pleasure.

671
01:17:13,118 --> 01:17:14,346
I'll see you out.

672
01:17:26,118 --> 01:17:29,906
You mustn't take it too seriously.
Usually they always say something.

673
01:17:30,118 --> 01:17:32,712
She might just as well say
"Mum, Mum, Mum".

674
01:17:32,838 --> 01:17:35,477
- It's just mechanical.
- I know.

675
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:45,108
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

676
01:18:38,158 --> 01:18:40,877
I'd like to hire a second nurse.

677
01:18:42,198 --> 01:18:44,348
The two could take turns.

678
01:18:45,398 --> 01:18:47,195
That would make everything
a bit simpler, wouldn't it?

679
01:18:49,158 --> 01:18:50,511
What do you think?

680
01:18:56,521 --> 01:18:57,641
Hurts.

681
01:19:00,779 --> 01:19:01,899
Hurts.

682
01:19:04,978 --> 01:19:06,098
Hurts.

683
01:19:07,645 --> 01:19:08,765
Hurts.

684
01:19:11,718 --> 01:19:14,391
- Please leave them in the kitchen.
- Yes.

685
01:19:16,278 --> 01:19:17,506
I'm back!

686
01:19:28,078 --> 01:19:29,193
Thank you.

687
01:19:35,598 --> 01:19:37,236
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

688
01:19:37,358 --> 01:19:39,428
No, thank you.
You've been a big help, Mr. Mry.

689
01:19:39,558 --> 01:19:41,628
It's nothing, sir.
Thanks a lot, sir.

690
01:19:41,998 --> 01:19:43,875
I'll let you know
if I need you again.

691
01:19:43,998 --> 01:19:45,590
With pleasure, sir.

692
01:19:46,438 --> 01:19:47,393
Goodbye.

693
01:19:50,678 --> 01:19:53,590
- May I say something, sir?
- Yes?

694
01:19:53,918 --> 01:19:59,072
My wife and I, we are very impressed
by your handling of the situation.

695
01:19:59,838 --> 01:20:01,032
I take my hat off to you.

696
01:20:01,478 --> 01:20:02,991
That's very kind of you.
Thank you.

697
01:20:05,998 --> 01:20:07,431
Until next time.

698
01:20:07,558 --> 01:20:10,391
- Give my regards to your wife.
- I certainly will.

699
01:20:15,958 --> 01:20:18,153
Hello Eva.
How are you?

700
01:20:24,478 --> 01:20:25,831
Things are fine.

701
01:20:28,998 --> 01:20:30,226
On...

702
01:20:35,079 --> 01:20:36,199
the...

703
01:20:37,846 --> 01:20:38,966
b...

704
01:20:39,358 --> 01:20:40,837
On the bridge...

705
01:20:40,998 --> 01:20:43,432
bridge of A...

706
01:20:43,678 --> 01:20:45,350
of Avignon...

707
01:20:47,278 --> 01:20:50,315
On the bridge of Avignon...

708
01:20:50,638 --> 01:20:52,196
the... the...

709
01:20:52,318 --> 01:20:54,434
- Come on, Anne.
- The bridge!

710
01:20:57,958 --> 01:20:58,993
of Avignon...

711
01:20:59,118 --> 01:21:03,077
vi... vi... vignon... gnon

712
01:21:03,198 --> 01:21:05,758
On the bridge of Avignon

713
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:08,234
we all dance there,
we all dance there

714
01:21:08,358 --> 01:21:11,077
- Dance!
- On the bridge of Avignon...

715
01:21:11,198 --> 01:21:13,871
- Dance!
- We all dance...

716
01:21:14,798 --> 01:21:17,471
- all... all...
- On the bridge of Avignon

717
01:21:17,638 --> 01:21:20,152
we all dance there,
we all dance there

718
01:21:20,318 --> 01:21:23,355
On the bridge of Avignon

719
01:21:23,718 --> 01:21:25,436
we all dance there in a ring

720
01:21:25,598 --> 01:21:27,589
On the bridge...

721
01:21:28,318 --> 01:21:30,593
dance... dance...

722
01:21:31,318 --> 01:21:33,309
all... all...

723
01:21:38,118 --> 01:21:39,346
There we are.

724
01:21:44,878 --> 01:21:47,551
Now you're all beautiful again.

725
01:21:48,358 --> 01:21:50,428
So everyone will admire you.

726
01:21:51,238 --> 01:21:52,273
That's it.

727
01:21:54,198 --> 01:21:56,428
You want to see?
Wait.

728
01:21:59,678 --> 01:22:00,952
Well?

729
01:22:02,118 --> 01:22:03,631
Aren't we a pretty sight?

730
01:22:46,918 --> 01:22:47,828
Shoo!

731
01:22:58,478 --> 01:22:59,513
Shoo!

732
01:23:06,838 --> 01:23:08,317
Shoo!

733
01:23:14,238 --> 01:23:15,910
As you wish, sir.

734
01:23:18,198 --> 01:23:20,758
I don't know
what you were expecting, but..

735
01:23:21,078 --> 01:23:23,911
I gave up another job
to come and work here.

736
01:23:24,398 --> 01:23:27,993
You should've thought it over before
if you'll need a second nurse or not.

737
01:23:28,238 --> 01:23:31,753
I didn't know then
how incompetent you are.

738
01:23:32,518 --> 01:23:33,667
What's that supposed to mean?

739
01:23:33,798 --> 01:23:37,313
I don't want to discuss it with you.
Anyway, you wouldn't understand.

740
01:23:37,838 --> 01:23:39,715
No one has ever reprimanded me.

741
01:23:39,838 --> 01:23:42,557
Good for you.
How much do I owe you?

742
01:23:45,878 --> 01:23:46,947
780 euro.

743
01:23:49,638 --> 01:23:52,106
I've never had anything like this
happen to me before.

744
01:23:53,358 --> 01:23:56,873
Who do you think you are?
I've been doing this job for years.

745
01:23:56,998 --> 01:23:59,148
I don't need you
to teach me how to do it.

746
01:23:59,278 --> 01:24:00,108
Do you have 20 euro?

747
01:24:08,518 --> 01:24:11,316
- No.
- Then take the 800 and go.

748
01:24:16,998 --> 01:24:19,114
You're a wicked old man.

749
01:24:20,478 --> 01:24:21,706
I feel sorry for you.

750
01:24:23,398 --> 01:24:24,606
I hope from the bottom of my heart

751
01:24:24,820 --> 01:24:27,658
that one day someone treats you
the same way you treat your patients,

752
01:24:28,638 --> 01:24:31,277
and that you too will have no way
of defending yourself.

753
01:24:31,438 --> 01:24:32,951
Now get out.

754
01:24:33,718 --> 01:24:35,151
Get out of here.

755
01:24:38,278 --> 01:24:40,667
Go fuck yourself, you old fart!

756
01:25:21,998 --> 01:25:24,114
Open your mouth, Anne.

757
01:25:25,398 --> 01:25:28,151
Come on, open your mouth.

758
01:25:31,398 --> 01:25:34,708
Anne! Please.

759
01:25:39,558 --> 01:25:40,593
Come on.

760
01:25:43,158 --> 01:25:44,307
Please.

761
01:25:48,558 --> 01:25:49,911
Stop it.

762
01:25:50,518 --> 01:25:52,395
If you don't drink, you'll die.

763
01:25:53,958 --> 01:25:54,754
Is that what you want?

764
01:26:00,398 --> 01:26:02,707
Come on.
Please.

765
01:26:12,038 --> 01:26:13,756
Christ almighty.

766
01:26:18,078 --> 01:26:20,831
You can't force me
to let you die of thirst.

767
01:26:21,638 --> 01:26:25,153
If you persist, I'll call Bertier
and he'll put you in hospital.

768
01:26:26,718 --> 01:26:30,552
They can force-feed you there.
Is that what you want?

769
01:26:33,798 --> 01:26:36,790
I promised to spare you that
but you must help me.

770
01:26:38,838 --> 01:26:40,430
I'm out of my depth.

771
01:26:43,598 --> 01:26:44,826
Come on, Anne.

772
01:26:53,078 --> 01:26:54,716
Drink this, now!

773
01:27:00,158 --> 01:27:02,718
That's it.
Good.

774
01:27:05,758 --> 01:27:06,986
Well, swallow it!

775
01:27:37,238 --> 01:27:38,512
Please, forgive me.

776
01:27:40,518 --> 01:27:41,553
I'm sorry.

777
01:28:52,838 --> 01:28:54,271
- Who's there?
- It's me.

778
01:28:54,598 --> 01:28:56,190
- Eva?
- Yes.

779
01:28:58,438 --> 01:28:59,871
Just a minute.

780
01:29:49,878 --> 01:29:51,470
- Hello.
- Hello.

781
01:29:53,078 --> 01:29:54,193
What was going on?

782
01:29:54,678 --> 01:29:56,509
Nothing.
I was in the toilet.

783
01:29:58,158 --> 01:29:59,432
No, come in.

784
01:30:10,358 --> 01:30:13,714
- Why this unannounced visit?
- What's going on with mum?

785
01:30:14,158 --> 01:30:17,195
Nothing.
What should be going on?

786
01:30:20,598 --> 01:30:22,350
Don't you want to sit down first?

787
01:30:29,278 --> 01:30:30,677
Why are you in Paris?

788
01:30:30,838 --> 01:30:34,513
What's going on with mum?
Why don't you answer the phone?

789
01:30:35,358 --> 01:30:37,955
Since our last conversation, I left
four messages on your answering machine.

790
01:30:38,155 --> 01:30:39,975
Why don't you call back?

791
01:30:40,678 --> 01:30:43,476
Sorry. I didn't listen to it.
Forgive me.

792
01:30:43,598 --> 01:30:45,793
Don't you realize we're worried?

793
01:30:47,878 --> 01:30:50,187
Your worries are no use to me.

794
01:30:50,718 --> 01:30:54,677
No, don't get me wrong.
I'm not criticizing you.

795
01:30:55,798 --> 01:30:58,676
I just don't have the time
to deal with your worries, that's all.

796
01:30:58,798 --> 01:31:02,154
- Dad...
- No, let's stop this conversation.

797
01:31:03,278 --> 01:31:07,237
Your mother is just as could have been
expected: bad the whole time.

798
01:31:08,598 --> 01:31:12,193
She is turning more and more
into a helpless child.

799
01:31:12,638 --> 01:31:15,550
It's sad and humiliating
for her and for me.

800
01:31:15,678 --> 01:31:18,317
And she doesn't want
to be seen in that state.

801
01:31:18,438 --> 01:31:22,226
Even the last time
she did not want you to come.

802
01:31:22,878 --> 01:31:24,410
You two have your own life.
Nothing wrong with that.

803
01:31:24,610 --> 01:31:26,526
But let us have our life too.
Okay?

804
01:31:26,838 --> 01:31:28,988
Dad, what's the matter?

805
01:31:29,798 --> 01:31:32,949
Nothing.
Your visit caught me by surprise.

806
01:31:33,118 --> 01:31:37,748
And I'm annoyed that you show up here
to check that everything's okay.

807
01:31:38,318 --> 01:31:40,468
Who do you think you are?

808
01:31:45,958 --> 01:31:48,028
Stay here, please.

809
01:31:50,718 --> 01:31:51,867
Please!

810
01:32:03,038 --> 01:32:03,993
Mum?

811
01:32:07,958 --> 01:32:08,868
Mum!

812
01:32:17,438 --> 01:32:19,156
Tell me, what's going on?
Have you gone crazy?

813
01:32:19,278 --> 01:32:20,049
Sit down.

814
01:32:20,078 --> 01:32:22,751
I don't want to sit down.
What's going on here?

815
01:32:22,878 --> 01:32:26,473
Nothing's going on. I want to spare
us all a pointless drama.

816
01:32:27,078 --> 01:32:29,911
I presume your mother is asleep.
She sleeps all day.

817
01:32:30,358 --> 01:32:32,633
And then she wakes up at night.

818
01:32:33,918 --> 01:32:36,352
If you really want to,
we'll go and see her in a little while.

819
01:32:37,678 --> 01:32:39,111
Now, sit down.

820
01:32:52,638 --> 01:32:58,259
We do our speech exercises every day,
or we sing together.

821
01:33:00,038 --> 01:33:05,112
Usually I wake up around 5.
At that time, she's still awake.

822
01:33:05,598 --> 01:33:10,274
We change the nappy,
I rub cream on her to avoid bed sores.

823
01:33:11,318 --> 01:33:16,187
Then, around 7, I try to persuade her
to eat and drink.

824
01:33:17,518 --> 01:33:19,748
Sometimes it works, sometimes not.

825
01:33:20,238 --> 01:33:23,310
Sometimes she tells me things
from her childhood.

826
01:33:23,478 --> 01:33:25,912
Or calls for help for hours.

827
01:33:27,318 --> 01:33:30,515
Then, suddenly, she starts giggling.

828
01:33:31,678 --> 01:33:33,111
Or crying.

829
01:33:36,998 --> 01:33:39,751
Nothing of any of that
is worth showing.

830
01:33:44,198 --> 01:33:46,587
You can't forbid me
from seeing her.

831
01:33:49,758 --> 01:33:50,588
No.

832
01:34:51,118 --> 01:34:52,437
It's me, Mum.

833
01:35:07,278 --> 01:35:09,508
Can I do something for you?

834
01:35:19,758 --> 01:35:20,827
Mum.

835
01:35:22,438 --> 01:35:23,712
Mum.

836
01:35:24,238 --> 01:35:25,591
Mum.

837
01:35:28,478 --> 01:35:29,593
Mum.

838
01:36:35,238 --> 01:36:36,307
The tea isn't very hot any more.

839
01:36:40,598 --> 01:36:42,031
But it does make you feel better.

840
01:36:53,438 --> 01:36:54,427
Thanks.

841
01:37:09,278 --> 01:37:11,838
It was silly of me
to lock the door.

842
01:37:12,278 --> 01:37:13,472
I'm sorry.

843
01:37:14,118 --> 01:37:15,756
You took me by surprise.

844
01:37:17,838 --> 01:37:19,271
I'm sorry.

845
01:37:20,958 --> 01:37:22,357
What's going to happen now?

846
01:37:24,558 --> 01:37:25,991
What's going to happen now?

847
01:37:27,598 --> 01:37:31,193
The nurse comes
three times a week.

848
01:37:31,318 --> 01:37:34,754
Every two weeks Dr. Bertier
and the hairdresser come.

849
01:37:35,518 --> 01:37:37,748
That's what you wanted to know?
No?

850
01:37:39,958 --> 01:37:42,677
Things will go on
as they have done up until now.

851
01:37:44,198 --> 01:37:45,480
They'll go from bad to worse.

852
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:47,778
Things will go on,
and then one day it will all be over.

853
01:37:49,798 --> 01:37:51,675
You can't go on like this, Dad.

854
01:37:51,798 --> 01:37:52,947
- No?
- No.

855
01:37:53,878 --> 01:37:55,391
What do you suggest?

856
01:37:56,078 --> 01:37:58,148
Can't we have a serious talk,
you and me?

857
01:37:59,078 --> 01:38:01,638
What do you call "a serious talk"?

858
01:38:02,638 --> 01:38:04,788
Do you want to have Mom live with you?

859
01:38:05,518 --> 01:38:07,603
Do you want to pack her off
to a care home?

860
01:38:07,803 --> 01:38:09,559
Is this what you want?

861
01:38:10,958 --> 01:38:14,314
Go on, talk to me seriously!

862
01:38:18,438 --> 01:38:20,110
All long...

863
01:38:21,278 --> 01:38:22,836
Ding dong...

864
01:38:26,438 --> 01:38:28,952
Yes, it swung to and fro.

865
01:38:29,078 --> 01:38:32,150
Yes, yes, to, fro.

866
01:38:32,438 --> 01:38:33,473
You...

867
01:38:35,118 --> 01:38:36,631
Very serious...

868
01:38:36,838 --> 01:38:38,066
Like that.

869
01:38:38,358 --> 01:38:39,347
Yes.

870
01:38:40,358 --> 01:38:41,393
Like that.

871
01:38:42,958 --> 01:38:44,027
Serious.

872
01:38:44,998 --> 01:38:47,068
Yes, I was very uptight.

873
01:38:47,518 --> 01:38:48,746
Yes.

874
01:38:49,798 --> 01:38:51,231
Up... tight.

875
01:38:55,518 --> 01:39:00,069
It... was... nice.

876
01:39:16,358 --> 01:39:17,871
Hurts.

877
01:39:21,678 --> 01:39:23,430
Hurts.

878
01:39:26,986 --> 01:39:27,806
Hurts.

879
01:39:39,598 --> 01:39:42,670
What's the matter.
Where do you hurt?

880
01:39:47,678 --> 01:39:49,031
What's going on?

881
01:39:49,998 --> 01:39:51,272
Is it the nappy?

882
01:39:52,038 --> 01:39:53,266
Is it full?

883
01:39:56,318 --> 01:39:57,671
Where do you hurt?

884
01:40:03,718 --> 01:40:07,472
It's all right, it's all right.
I'm here.

885
01:40:11,798 --> 01:40:13,026
Everything's fine.

886
01:40:17,558 --> 01:40:18,752
We will...

887
01:40:19,958 --> 01:40:22,188
Do you want me
to tell you a story?

888
01:40:24,358 --> 01:40:27,316
But you must be quiet,
I can't talk too loud.

889
01:40:28,758 --> 01:40:30,316
It wears me out.

890
01:40:34,438 --> 01:40:36,508
When I was little,

891
01:40:36,918 --> 01:40:39,796
well, I wasn't as little as all that,

892
01:40:40,238 --> 01:40:44,914
I think it was
toward the end of primary school,

893
01:40:45,238 --> 01:40:47,468
so I was about 10.

894
01:40:49,358 --> 01:40:53,192
Dad and mum had sent me
to a holiday camp.

895
01:40:53,598 --> 01:40:58,274
They thought it would do me good to
spend the summer with kids my own age.

896
01:40:59,598 --> 01:41:02,396
We were lodged in an old castle

897
01:41:04,998 --> 01:41:08,070
in the midst of the forest.
I think it was in the Auvergne.

898
01:41:09,118 --> 01:41:10,517
I don't remember.

899
01:41:11,398 --> 01:41:15,471
In any case it was the opposite
of what I'd expected.

900
01:41:18,598 --> 01:41:22,955
We had to get up at 6 in the morning
and plunge into a lake.

901
01:41:23,278 --> 01:41:26,270
It was a small lake
not far from the castle.

902
01:41:26,518 --> 01:41:30,431
It was fed by an icy mountain stream.

903
01:41:31,318 --> 01:41:34,993
We had to enter it running,
in a double file.

904
01:41:37,038 --> 01:41:39,950
You know,
I was never very sporty.

905
01:41:41,398 --> 01:41:46,415
They had worked out a programme
to keep us on the go all day,

906
01:41:50,638 --> 01:41:56,486
Probably to nip in... in the bud

907
01:41:57,638 --> 01:42:00,550
any potential pubescent impulses.

908
01:42:01,478 --> 01:42:03,548
But the worst thing was the food.

909
01:42:05,358 --> 01:42:11,194
The third day after our arrival,
there was rice pudding for lunch.

910
01:42:11,478 --> 01:42:13,309
I hate rice pudding.

911
01:42:13,878 --> 01:42:19,828
We sat at long tables in a huge hall.

912
01:42:20,318 --> 01:42:22,468
I didn't want to eat the stuff.

913
01:42:25,278 --> 01:42:28,313
One of the monitors said to me:

914
01:42:28,988 --> 01:42:33,073
"If you don't clear your plate,
you won't get out of here."

915
01:42:34,878 --> 01:42:38,075
So after the meal everybody left,

916
01:42:38,558 --> 01:42:41,595
and I remained alone, in tears.

917
01:42:44,278 --> 01:42:48,157
I had made a secret pact with mum.

918
01:42:48,598 --> 01:42:53,797
I was to write to her every week.
I was to send her a postcard.

919
01:42:54,038 --> 01:42:59,670
If I liked the stay,
I was to draw flowers,

920
01:43:00,198 --> 01:43:02,553
if not, stars.

921
01:43:03,518 --> 01:43:08,638
She kept the card.
It was covered all over in stars.

922
01:43:10,918 --> 01:43:14,513
After three hours,
I was finally allowed to get out.

923
01:43:16,078 --> 01:43:19,593
I went up to my room,
got into bed

924
01:43:20,398 --> 01:43:22,628
I had a fever of over 40 degrees.

925
01:43:23,358 --> 01:43:24,791
It was diphtheria.

926
01:43:25,958 --> 01:43:30,588
I was taken
to the nearest hospital

927
01:43:31,078 --> 01:43:33,194
and sent to quarantine.

928
01:43:33,998 --> 01:43:37,115
Which meant that mum,
when she came to visit me,

929
01:43:37,758 --> 01:43:40,875
could only wave at me
through a window.

930
01:43:45,918 --> 01:43:48,227
At some point I lost that postcard.

931
01:43:50,198 --> 01:43:51,472
It's a pity.

932
01:54:20,478 --> 01:54:23,550
...you won't believe it.
A pigeon came in,

933
01:54:23,678 --> 01:54:26,954
for the second time already,
through the light well.

934
01:54:27,078 --> 01:54:31,310
This time I caught it.
In fact it wasn't difficult at all.

935
01:54:31,438 --> 01:54:33,668
But I set it free again.

936
01:56:24,398 --> 01:56:26,036
I'm almost done.

937
01:56:30,158 --> 01:56:32,069
You can put your shoes on if you want.

938
01:57:38,918 --> 01:57:40,067
Thank you.

939
01:57:47,678 --> 01:57:49,430
Aren't you taking a coat?
