1
00:01:07,466 --> 00:01:10,744
Hey. Aron here, leave a message.

2
00:01:11,512 --> 00:01:14,399
Hi Aron, Sonja here...again.

3
00:01:14,593 --> 00:01:17,622
I know youre gonna be away
this weekend, but ...

4
00:01:17,623 --> 00:01:19,634
think about what we are going to play.

5
00:01:19,635 --> 00:01:23,688
Please, we really have to decide
we need to practice.

6
00:01:23,723 --> 00:01:25,886
It will be fun, I promise.

7
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:29,499
And call mom, please.
Because she worries ...

8
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,957
which you already knew.
later A, bye.

9
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:22,608
It's Friday night.

10
00:03:23,285 --> 00:03:26,404
April 25, 2003.

11
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:29,679
Im just entering Canyonlands.

12
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,468
Just me, the music and the night.

13
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:37,106
Love it.

14
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,874
SATURDAY

15
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,819
Blue John Canyon.

16
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:08,120
The guidebook says:
4.5 hours until the Big Dropper.

17
00:05:08,488 --> 00:05:11,361
I want to take 45 minutes off of that.

18
00:07:24,448 --> 00:07:26,489
I think we opmoeten side.

19
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:30,797
And if we proceed this way ...

20
00:07:31,808 --> 00:07:37,248
Youre doing Blue John too?
- No, were headed for the Dome.

21
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:39,407
But I think we are lost.
- She's lost.

22
00:07:39,408 --> 00:07:41,046
Hang on.

23
00:07:46,644 --> 00:07:48,353
Lets see this.

24
00:07:49,578 --> 00:07:53,190
You are ... here.
- We are?

25
00:07:53,655 --> 00:07:56,460
I knew that.

26
00:07:56,461 --> 00:08:00,862
And the Dome is there.

27
00:08:03,034 --> 00:08:05,662
I can take you that way
 if you like.

28
00:08:07,766 --> 00:08:12,205
Sorry, Friday the 13th there.

29
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:17,671
I'm only a psychopath
on weekdays. It's Saturday.

30
00:08:19,572 --> 00:08:22,527
I cant take this off.

31
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,747
Aron.
- Kristi.

32
00:08:28,748 --> 00:08:31,536
Let me introduce you to
my friend Megan.

33
00:08:32,156 --> 00:08:34,851
Nice to meet you.
- An honor.

34
00:08:35,371 --> 00:08:38,827
What do you say?
You're lost, I am the guide.

35
00:08:42,831 --> 00:08:45,669
Why not.
- Sure.

36
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:48,336
This way.

37
00:08:48,337 --> 00:08:52,733
So you biked from Horseshoe?
Is that like 32 km?

38
00:08:52,734 --> 00:08:54,795
27 on the odometer.

39
00:08:55,607 --> 00:08:58,341
I thought it was 27.6.

40
00:08:58,342 --> 00:09:00,714
27.8. Actually.

41
00:09:00,715 --> 00:09:03,100
Ah, You're one of those.

42
00:09:03,101 --> 00:09:06,001
Not one of those.
- Do you spend a lot of time out here?

43
00:09:06,684 --> 00:09:08,774
Its my second home.

44
00:09:11,194 --> 00:09:14,127
See? Theres the fork right there.

45
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:17,470
We totally missed that.
- Glad we bumped into you.

46
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,116
What are the odds considering we're out here.
- Exactly.

47
00:09:21,117 --> 00:09:25,531
You're in the one place in America
where you're guaranteed 
not to run into a weirdo...

48
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:27,685
And what happend?

49
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,668
Allright. So the guidebook says...

50
00:09:32,669 --> 00:09:36,847
that the route is through here
-but I know a better way.

51
00:09:37,364 --> 00:09:39,745
The cool way.

52
00:09:40,155 --> 00:09:44,486
Guaranteed, the best time you can have
with your clothes on.

53
00:09:44,487 --> 00:09:47,712
Although, 
it's better with your clothes off.

54
00:09:49,364 --> 00:09:52,152
It is a bit of a climb.
- We climb.

55
00:09:52,763 --> 00:09:55,882
And a bit of a squeeze.
- We squeeze.

56
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:05,455
So you get us all the way here
and then you tell us you're not a guide ...

57
00:10:05,456 --> 00:10:07,858
Well no, I'm an engineer.

58
00:10:07,859 --> 00:10:09,856
But this is what 
I really want to do.

59
00:10:10,397 --> 00:10:13,817
Wonderful. I always wanted
to be a supermodel, but ...

60
00:10:13,818 --> 00:10:16,685
I don't think thats really gonna work.

61
00:10:17,145 --> 00:10:22,051
Jesus. What if these things move?
- They've been here for millions of years.
They're not gonna move.

62
00:10:22,144 --> 00:10:24,772
Oh sure they will.
- What?

63
00:10:25,468 --> 00:10:28,914
Everything's moving all the time.
Just hope not today.

64
00:10:29,374 --> 00:10:31,217
Great.

65
00:10:36,186 --> 00:10:40,320
All you've got to remember,
is that everything will be okay.

66
00:10:40,914 --> 00:10:43,036
My God!

67
00:10:46,064 --> 00:10:49,208
Aron, are you okay?

68
00:11:06,812 --> 00:11:10,922
Listen to the guy, he's fine.

69
00:11:11,682 --> 00:11:15,036
He is bad shit.
You're bad shit!

70
00:11:16,316 --> 00:11:19,270
Come on.
You've gotta come down here.

71
00:11:19,689 --> 00:11:23,024
Trust me.
- Trust you? I'll kill you Aron Ralston.

72
00:11:23,025 --> 00:11:25,955
Oh, please, you love this.

73
00:11:42,714 --> 00:11:44,426
Nice job!

74
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,697
Megan, you're missing it.
- It's amazing.

75
00:11:48,698 --> 00:11:52,398
Fuck.
- Just jump, Megan.

76
00:12:00,662 --> 00:12:03,634
Are you okay?
- Nice job.

77
00:12:06,632 --> 00:12:09,115
We've got to do it again.
- Again?

78
00:12:09,602 --> 00:12:12,098
Camera.

79
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:31,039
So, Blue John ...

80
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,738
is actually named after
Butch Cassidy's cook.

81
00:12:37,197 --> 00:12:40,205
From Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

82
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:44,183
And they would hide out
in these canyons, I guess,

83
00:12:44,184 --> 00:12:50,695
but would also run wild horses into here
and trap them at the end of the canyon ...

84
00:12:50,696 --> 00:12:53,036
and that's how they caught the horses.

85
00:12:53,037 --> 00:12:55,814
Another picture before I go?
- Yes.

86
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,911
Ready?

87
00:12:58,976 --> 00:13:03,438
One, two, three ...

88
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:07,397
Will I ever see you again?
- That depends, do you party?

89
00:13:08,672 --> 00:13:11,314
Do I party? Yes, sometimes.

90
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,778
Tomorrow we're throwing a party,
if you want to come.

91
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:17,863
Yeah, you shoud come by for a beer.
- OK, where am I going?

92
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:22,517
It is 32 km away, near Green River.
Behind the old motel.

93
00:13:22,617 --> 00:13:26,887
There will be a huge inflatable
Scooby-Doo. Can't miss it.

94
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,261
Good to meet you.
- Bye.

95
00:13:32,262 --> 00:13:35,264
Scooby-Doo.

96
00:13:35,265 --> 00:13:37,695
Rock on.

97
00:13:40,494 --> 00:13:43,126
You think he's actually gonna show up?

98
00:13:43,127 --> 00:13:46,746
I don't think we figured in his day at all.

99
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:50,559
You liked him.

100
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:54,213
127 HOURS

101
00:17:34,905 --> 00:17:37,716
This is insane.

102
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,877
Move this fucking rock.

103
00:18:16,865 --> 00:18:18,678
Please.

104
00:19:18,937 --> 00:19:23,899
Kristi! Megan!

105
00:20:00,104 --> 00:20:03,049
Just think.

106
00:22:16,922 --> 00:22:19,396
Shit.

107
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,843
Sweet.

108
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,307
Knife's dull.

109
00:25:48,025 --> 00:25:53,373
SUNDAY

110
00:26:30,192 --> 00:26:33,811
Look at the size of this.
How the fuck did this get here?

111
00:30:40,813 --> 00:30:42,233
Hi, buddy.

112
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:45,101
Here we go.

113
00:31:32,146 --> 00:31:35,051
It's 03:05.

114
00:31:35,052 --> 00:31:40,087
Sunday, April 27, 2003.

115
00:31:40,757 --> 00:31:45,963
This marks 24 hours...

116
00:31:45,964 --> 00:31:54,131
of being stuck in Blue John Canyon.
Just before the junction for the Big Drop.

117
00:31:55,883 --> 00:31:59,247
My name is Aron Ralston.
My parents are ...

118
00:31:59,248 --> 00:32:02,423
Donna and Larry Ralston.
From Englewood Colorado.

119
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:10,449
Whoever finds this, can keep the recorder ...

120
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:15,171
but please get in touch with my parents
and give them this tape.

121
00:32:15,172 --> 00:32:17,299
I would appreciate it.

122
00:32:19,002 --> 00:32:23,735
I was descending Blue John yesterday ...

123
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:30,506
when this chalkstone came loose ...

124
00:32:30,507 --> 00:32:33,000
and rolled onto my arm.

125
00:32:33,001 --> 00:32:35,497
Now it's stuck.

126
00:32:36,842 --> 00:32:41,594
The arm has a blue-gray color.

127
00:32:42,442 --> 00:32:46,967
It's been without circulation for 24 hours.

128
00:32:49,238 --> 00:32:52,090
I think it's pretty well gone.

129
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:55,960
I'm low on food.

130
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:02,163
That's about 300-400 ml.

131
00:33:02,796 --> 00:33:05,078
And that's it for water.

132
00:33:08,707 --> 00:33:13,111
I'm in pretty deep doo here.

133
00:33:16,959 --> 00:33:18,774
Hello?

134
00:33:19,115 --> 00:33:22,827
Please, there's somebody down here.

135
00:33:23,229 --> 00:33:26,993
Help! I am in the Canyon.

136
00:34:05,868 --> 00:34:09,620
Please, help!

137
00:34:10,578 --> 00:34:12,808
Help!

138
00:34:12,809 --> 00:34:16,751
Down here. Help!

139
00:34:30,154 --> 00:34:32,788
Don't lose it.

140
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:40,410
Aron ...

141
00:34:42,112 --> 00:34:45,654
do not lose it.

142
00:35:36,733 --> 00:35:39,062
Not bad.

143
00:35:48,816 --> 00:35:51,022
Dinner.

144
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:03,404
Tomorrow we're throwing a party,
if you want to come.

145
00:36:03,405 --> 00:36:08,263
Have a beer.There will be a huge inflatable
Scooby-Doo.

146
00:36:08,913 --> 00:36:11,036
Scooby-Doo.

147
00:36:33,405 --> 00:36:35,796
Cold cans.

148
00:36:37,742 --> 00:36:39,917
Plastic cup.

149
00:36:41,837 --> 00:36:43,317
Thank you.

150
00:36:46,365 --> 00:36:48,999
Can I take a beer?

151
00:36:50,224 --> 00:36:52,307
Won't mind if I do.

152
00:37:52,911 --> 00:37:56,478
Aron here, leave a message.

153
00:37:59,283 --> 00:38:02,359
Aron, it's mom.

154
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,491
I was hoping to catch you.

155
00:38:05,051 --> 00:38:08,188
Are you there? Hello?

156
00:38:10,623 --> 00:38:12,832
Okay. Nothing urgent.

157
00:38:13,552 --> 00:38:16,467
Doug is in New York.
So it will be a quiet weekend.

158
00:38:17,314 --> 00:38:19,544
Call me.

159
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:42,373
Where are you going?
- Don't know yet.

160
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:46,898
Right there, Brian.
- Maybe Utah, maybe somewhere else.

161
00:38:47,802 --> 00:38:51,334
Have a good one.
- Always do.

162
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,503
Let's go.

163
00:39:20,504 --> 00:39:25,110
MONDAY

164
00:41:49,975 --> 00:41:53,211
It's freaking me out 
looking at myself.

165
00:41:53,737 --> 00:41:56,552
Sorry, hope thats okay.

166
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:03,050
It's Monday.

167
00:42:04,834 --> 00:42:09,667
Bummer, all day.
I tried to set up this pulley.

168
00:42:09,668 --> 00:42:12,260
All morning.
But it did not work.

169
00:42:12,661 --> 00:42:18,083
It was worth a try,
but there is too much friction,

170
00:42:18,666 --> 00:42:21,568
It's climbing rope, so theres too much stretch.

171
00:42:22,025 --> 00:42:27,279
What I could use is 
20 meters of static rope ...

172
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,174
9.8 millimeters.

173
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:36,263
Three or four pulleys, rack of carabiners,
a sling, powerdrill ...

174
00:42:36,264 --> 00:42:38,970
and a Pull Kit.

175
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:44,689
and eight burley men to do the hawling.

176
00:42:46,722 --> 00:42:49,769
That should just about do it.

177
00:42:55,768 --> 00:42:59,341
another 150 ml of water left.

178
00:43:00,615 --> 00:43:05,483
That should keep me alive til tomorrow night.

179
00:43:06,154 --> 00:43:10,015
If I'm lucky.
I peeded twice.

180
00:43:10,662 --> 00:43:15,044
almost pissed my pants.

181
00:43:16,391 --> 00:43:19,337
My body's acting really wierd.

182
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:24,394
The second time I did it in the CamelBak.

183
00:43:27,952 --> 00:43:30,031
It smells really bad.

184
00:43:32,029 --> 00:43:34,178
But I'm sure it'll settle.

185
00:43:35,941 --> 00:43:39,990
It's gotta be chilled,
like Sauvignon Blanc.

186
00:43:43,226 --> 00:43:45,379
No number twos.

187
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:48,601
Which should disappoint my insect friends.

188
00:43:49,137 --> 00:43:50,882
They'll just have to wait.

189
00:43:51,536 --> 00:43:54,666
Let's see, what else can I tell you?

190
00:43:56,462 --> 00:44:01,139
There is this raven that comes every morning.

191
00:44:05,217 --> 00:44:08,894
I clocked it at 08:17.

192
00:44:11,062 --> 00:44:15,519
I'll film it for you tomorrow.

193
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:21,093
Every morning at 09:30 
I get fifteen minutes sunlight.

194
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:23,717
Really nice.

195
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:32,020
I've been chipping away.

196
00:44:32,021 --> 00:44:34,692
More to keep warm than anything.

197
00:44:36,066 --> 00:44:40,861
I'm beginning to think that my hand
is supporting the rock.

198
00:44:40,862 --> 00:44:45,536
So what if I chip away a bit,
it actually settles more.

199
00:44:52,349 --> 00:44:55,911
I've found this great tourniquette.

200
00:46:18,065 --> 00:46:21,289
It hasn't been very useful.

201
00:46:24,456 --> 00:46:30,448
Listen! Don't buy the cheap 
made-in-China multitool.

202
00:46:30,691 --> 00:46:34,239
I tried to find my Swiss Army knife.

203
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:39,103
This thing came free with a flashlight.
The flashlight was a piece of shit too.

204
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:42,768
I kept it in my truck for emergencies.

205
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:47,200
I don't blame you, Mom.

206
00:46:47,201 --> 00:46:53,205
It was a perfectly great stocking stuffer.

207
00:46:55,363 --> 00:46:59,721
No way you could have ever known
I'd get in this kind of trouble.

208
00:47:00,476 --> 00:47:03,931
If you look back to it later
the camera turned on?

209
00:47:03,932 --> 00:47:08,048
You have to leave the camera with us 
when we wanna see something
that you've made.

210
00:47:08,049 --> 00:47:10,823
Good job, Hon.

211
00:47:14,057 --> 00:47:19,175
That is really beautiful.
- He's filming her now..

212
00:47:19,176 --> 00:47:23,821
We can show this?

213
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:27,685
Go away.

214
00:47:28,713 --> 00:47:32,114
We can't just watch it there.

215
00:47:36,296 --> 00:47:39,993
Well done.

216
00:47:42,929 --> 00:47:45,338
Way to go Sis.

217
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:48,184
Keep playing?
- Yes honey, keep going.

218
00:49:35,521 --> 00:49:39,406
I love you.

219
00:50:16,631 --> 00:50:19,323
So ...

220
00:50:20,111 --> 00:50:23,679
how do I get in?

221
00:50:24,528 --> 00:50:28,755
What is the ...

222
00:50:31,813 --> 00:50:35,166
combination?

223
00:50:37,472 --> 00:50:41,055
If I told you ...

224
00:50:41,056 --> 00:50:44,018
I'd have to kill you.

225
00:50:44,019 --> 00:50:47,554
You've already killed me.

226
00:50:59,137 --> 00:51:05,002
Combination? 
I think I have it.

227
00:54:03,842 --> 00:54:06,637
Who's there?

228
00:54:49,501 --> 00:54:53,112
Please.

229
00:55:05,273 --> 00:55:09,052
Please.

230
00:55:15,196 --> 00:55:17,794
TUESDAY

231
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:35,671
Good morning, everyone. It is seven o'clock
here in Canyon Country USA.

232
00:55:36,311 --> 00:55:41,211
This morning, on the boulder,
we have a very special guest:

233
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:45,703
Self-proclaimed american superhero ...

234
00:55:45,704 --> 00:55:50,798
Aron Ralston.
Lets hear it for Aron.

235
00:55:53,185 --> 00:55:59,174
It is a real pleasure to be here.
Thank you. Thanks.

236
00:56:00,104 --> 00:56:03,792
Can I say hi to my mom and dad?

237
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:08,397
Mom and Dad. 
Mustn't forget Mom and Dad. Right, Aron?

238
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:11,021
Yeah, that's right.

239
00:56:11,022 --> 00:56:16,207
Hi mom, I'm really sorry 
I didn't answer the phone the other night.

240
00:56:16,451 --> 00:56:20,351
If I had, I would have
told you where I was going and then ...

241
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:25,051
I probably wouldn't be here.
 That's for sure.

242
00:56:25,441 --> 00:56:27,836
But like I always say ...

243
00:56:27,837 --> 00:56:32,988
Your supreme selfishness
is our gain.

244
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:36,025
Thank you, Aron.
Anyone else you'd like to say hi to?

245
00:56:36,787 --> 00:56:40,169
Brian, at work.

246
00:56:40,922 --> 00:56:44,234
I probably won't be making it in to work today.

247
00:56:45,454 --> 00:56:48,087
Get a load of this guy.
Wait.

248
00:56:48,088 --> 00:56:53,145
We got a question coming in from another aron ...

249
00:56:53,146 --> 00:56:57,173
...in Loser Canyon, Utah.

250
00:56:57,822 --> 00:57:01,077
Aron asks: 
Am I right in thinking ...

251
00:57:01,078 --> 00:57:06,047
that even if Brian from work
notifies the police ...

252
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:11,480
they'll put a 24-hour hold on it
before they file a missing persons report?

253
00:57:11,481 --> 00:57:15,891
Which means you won't become
 officially missing ...

254
00:57:15,892 --> 00:57:20,412
until miday Wednesday at the earliest.

255
00:57:20,413 --> 00:57:23,480
You're right on the money there, Aron.

256
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:28,183
Which means,
 I'll probably be dead by then.

257
00:57:28,184 --> 00:57:30,672
Aron from Loser Canyon, Utah.

258
00:57:30,673 --> 00:57:34,493
How do you know so much?
- I will tell you.

259
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,475
I volunteer for the rescue service.

260
00:57:39,338 --> 00:57:45,408
I'm something of a,
big fucking hard hero.

261
00:57:46,021 --> 00:57:50,692
I can do everything on my own.

262
00:57:50,693 --> 00:57:53,854
I do see.

263
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:58,404
Is it true that despite ...

264
00:57:59,056 --> 00:58:04,113
or maybe because
 you're a fucking hard hero ...

265
00:58:04,114 --> 00:58:07,569
You didn't tell anyone 
where you were going?

266
00:58:10,078 --> 00:58:12,577
Yeah, that's absolutely correct.

267
00:58:15,587 --> 00:58:18,617
Anyone?
- Anyone.

268
00:58:48,955 --> 00:58:52,032
Mom, Dad ...

269
00:58:53,973 --> 00:58:58,630
I wanna take this time to tell you,
the times we've spent together 
were awesome...

270
00:59:01,756 --> 00:59:05,595
and I haven't appreciated you in my heart
as I know that I could.

271
00:59:07,857 --> 00:59:11,259
Mom, I love you ...

272
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:14,308
and I wish I
had returned all your calls...

273
00:59:14,309 --> 00:59:16,452
Ever.

274
00:59:19,015 --> 00:59:23,031
I love you guys.

275
00:59:23,770 --> 00:59:27,065
And I'll always be with you.

276
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:10,463
Pwnd!

277
01:01:38,727 --> 01:01:46,358
WEDNESDAY

278
01:02:20,493 --> 01:02:22,843
This is no Slurpy.

279
01:02:25,778 --> 01:02:28,372
It's like a bag of piss.

280
01:03:03,722 --> 01:03:05,684
I'm going again.

281
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:11,106
With clothes on.

282
01:03:11,472 --> 01:03:15,848
Tell him.
- We are very worried about you.

283
01:03:16,855 --> 01:03:20,060
An advice for your choice of music.

284
01:03:20,061 --> 01:03:23,873
If you "Fish are really rock and keeps on singing ...
- Then you never get a girlfriend.

285
01:03:23,874 --> 01:03:27,422
Maybe but I doubt it.
- You are more or less clever.

286
01:03:27,423 --> 01:03:29,180
From time to time.

287
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:32,616
This cannon ball is for you.

288
01:03:42,205 --> 01:03:48,904
I'm going to test your theory
whether it's better ...

289
01:03:49,213 --> 01:03:51,720
with or without clothes.

290
01:04:18,534 --> 01:04:22,088
Don't.

291
01:04:22,089 --> 01:04:26,456
Please, don't.

292
01:04:28,552 --> 01:04:32,146
Don't.
- Ralston, rock on.

293
01:06:26,536 --> 01:06:29,969
You don't even want me here, do you?

294
01:06:31,909 --> 01:06:34,551
I'm gonna go, Aron.

295
01:06:36,803 --> 01:06:39,208
Is that what you want?

296
01:06:42,232 --> 01:06:44,681
It is, isn't it?

297
01:06:51,761 --> 01:06:54,068
Come back.

298
01:06:57,676 --> 01:06:59,913
You're gonna be so lonely, Aron.

299
01:07:16,644 --> 01:07:20,753
46, 47, 48, 49 ...

300
01:07:20,754 --> 01:07:24,744
50! Who remains is seen.

301
01:07:28,353 --> 01:07:30,060
I'm holding on.

302
01:07:31,543 --> 01:07:34,382
Time's moving really slowly.

303
01:07:35,165 --> 01:07:41,731
My heart's beating really fast.
It feels like it ...

304
01:07:41,732 --> 01:07:44,514
it's beating three times as fast as it shold be.

305
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:54,530
So cold.

306
01:08:00,301 --> 01:08:01,502
Blue John.

307
01:08:06,471 --> 01:08:11,411
I love you.

308
01:08:13,709 --> 01:08:19,008
Rana, I've been thinking about you, girl.

309
01:08:24,939 --> 01:08:28,852
I know how I am.
I've tried to do everything.
 Whatever it was ...

310
01:08:28,853 --> 01:08:33,011
I tried.
- where are you.

311
01:08:45,883 --> 01:08:49,822
What are you guys doing here? Andy.

312
01:08:50,468 --> 01:08:53,759
Tom. Hi, guys.
Whats going on?

313
01:08:59,907 --> 01:09:02,995
You look like the Hole in the Wall Gang.

314
01:09:05,366 --> 01:09:07,365
Dorks.

315
01:09:09,832 --> 01:09:12,048
Found you Aron.

316
01:09:18,767 --> 01:09:23,087
Sis, sorry I won't be at your wedding.

317
01:09:23,088 --> 01:09:25,512
I know that I promised to play.

318
01:09:25,513 --> 01:09:27,902
That we play.

319
01:09:27,903 --> 01:09:31,566
I'm sorry.
I know it'll be a good one.

320
01:09:33,645 --> 01:09:38,023
8:15, there's no raven.
8:20 ...

321
01:09:38,486 --> 01:09:41,790
My raven didn't come.

322
01:09:45,829 --> 01:09:48,135
I've been thinking.

323
01:09:48,136 --> 01:09:51,463
Everything ...

324
01:09:51,464 --> 01:09:54,860
... just comes together.
- You're gonna be so lonely, Aron.

325
01:09:54,867 --> 01:09:56,948
Have a good one.
- Always do.

326
01:09:56,949 --> 01:09:59,390
Later!
- It' me.

327
01:09:59,391 --> 01:10:01,089
Aron, it's mom.

328
01:10:01,090 --> 01:10:03,503
I was hoping to catch you.
- I chose this.

329
01:10:03,504 --> 01:10:05,663
Doug is in New York.
So it'll be a quiet weekend.

330
01:10:05,664 --> 01:10:08,768
I chose all of this.
- Call me.

331
01:10:12,587 --> 01:10:15,031
This rock ...

332
01:10:15,676 --> 01:10:18,963
This rock has been waiting for me 
my entire life.

333
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:22,413
I hate this rock!

334
01:10:23,521 --> 01:10:27,867
It's entire life. Ever since it was
a bit of meteorite.

335
01:10:27,868 --> 01:10:30,950
A million billion years ago.
- How the fuck did this get here?

336
01:10:30,951 --> 01:10:34,266
There in space.
It's been waiting ...

337
01:10:35,881 --> 01:10:38,123
to come here.

338
01:10:38,124 --> 01:10:41,127
Right, right here.

339
01:10:43,689 --> 01:10:47,541
I've been moving towards it my whole life.
 The minute I was born.

340
01:10:47,977 --> 01:10:51,347
Every breath I've taken,
 every action ...

341
01:10:51,348 --> 01:10:56,555
has been leading me to this.
A crack in the surface.

342
01:15:11,639 --> 01:15:13,839
Come on.

343
01:15:48,059 --> 01:15:50,627
Don't pass out.

344
01:18:51,003 --> 01:18:53,229
Thank you.

345
01:21:00,767 --> 01:21:02,661
Easy.

346
01:21:08,124 --> 01:21:11,813
Easy. Come on.

347
01:24:43,436 --> 01:24:45,554
Help me.

348
01:24:50,772 --> 01:24:53,596
I need help.

349
01:25:04,781 --> 01:25:11,949
I need some water.
I was stuck in a crack.

350
01:25:12,495 --> 01:25:17,505
Some water, please.
I cut my arm off.

351
01:25:19,953 --> 01:25:22,969
Please, some water.

352
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:26,483
Thank you.

353
01:25:35,415 --> 01:25:38,415
Do you have a phone?
- Yes, but no signal.

354
01:25:38,953 --> 01:25:42,354
You should stop and rest.
- No.

355
01:25:42,355 --> 01:25:43,935
I better keep going.

356
01:25:44,762 --> 01:25:48,210
Walk on. Run ahead.

357
01:27:59,780 --> 01:28:03,382
Aron's premonition came true.

358
01:28:04,186 --> 01:28:07,836
He met his wife Jessica three years later.

359
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:13,840
Their son, Leo, was born in February 2010.

360
01:28:17,730 --> 01:28:22,011
Aron continued to climb
and canyoneering do.

361
01:28:28,276 --> 01:28:34,288
He always leaves a note
where he goes.
