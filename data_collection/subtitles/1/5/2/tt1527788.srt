1
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,810
-Yes, sir.
- Where are you?

2
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:01,150
We're making a U-turn
and we're on our way.

3
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,220
Let's get ready.

4
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,160
Yes, sir.

5
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,160
Two in the front,
the rest block the stairs.

6
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,500
Jump him as a group.
He's one strong bastard.

7
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,740
I told you we should call for backup.

8
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,700
- You scared?
- Of course not.

9
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,080
Let's hurry and finally end
this two-month stakeout.

10
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,620
He's in.

11
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,930
Hurry!.

12
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,700
Grab the big guy, but let the kid go.

13
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,000
Make sure you see him deliver it.

14
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,210
Hello?

15
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,350
It's been delivered.

16
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,290
- You can't go in, sir.
- Let go of me! Stay still!

17
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,160
Stay still, asshole.

18
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,440
I got the goods.

19
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,580
I'll leave right now.

20
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,080
Bear is on the move.

21
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,480
What do I do?

22
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,510
- You sure about the delivery?
- I saw it!

23
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,280
- Why isn't he coming out?
- I told you, I saw it myself!

24
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,980
Do I jump him or not?

25
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,220
Once he's out the door,
it's all over!

26
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,730
Sir!

27
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,320
Sir!

28
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,200
Get him.

29
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,770
Mother fucker!

30
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,070
Stay still!

31
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,770
Goddamn it!

32
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,300
Fucking bastard!

33
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,410
Grab him!

34
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,450
Teddy bear!

35
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,600
Let's go.

36
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,690
We got snacks for you
at the station.

37
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,360
Mother fucker.

38
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,340
He got away.

39
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,790
- Ran with the goods.
- Fuck!

40
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,780
Don't get so worked up.

41
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,190
Those little pricks.

42
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,400
Crazy bitch.

43
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:35,560
You squeeze it, you buy it.

44
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,090
What do you need?

45
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,690
Come out.

46
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,430
Or I'll kill you.

47
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,210
I didn't steal your milk.

48
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:27,740
I'm not lying.

49
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,480
I don't steal anymore.

50
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,080
Hey, flowers!

51
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,650
You know Yong-chul, right?

52
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,120
I saw him in the bathroom
and I was so embarrassed.

53
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:45,320
The kids asked if I liked him,
but why would l?

54
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:49,640
And look, my tooth is shaky.

55
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,930
Does it hurt when
you pull your tooth out?

56
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:54,880
Huh?

57
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,600
Mister?

58
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,870
Why do I bother?

59
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,940
I'm too old to pull my tooth out.

60
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,150
I don't want to.

61
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,620
Why only a dollar?

62
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,370
You owed me fifty cents.

63
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,670
But I put in a lot of new songs.

64
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:28,100
- You have bad taste in music.
- How mean.

65
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:33,570
Give that back for a second.

66
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,450
Sausage!

67
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,450
I like sausage too.

68
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,860
What are you saving up for?

69
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,070
Ta-da!

70
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,670
Nail art.

71
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:02,130
I'm the best in my class.
Should I do yours?

72
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,840
A lot of men do it these days.

73
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,140
Are you really a gangster?

74
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:16,050
They say you're hiding
because you did something bad.

75
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:20,790
And Mom warned me
that you're a child molester.

76
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:24,950
What?

77
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:32,070
Do you think I'm a bad guy, too?

78
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,200
Well...

79
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,910
You do look like the prison type.

80
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:46,350
- JUNG So-mi! Are you in there?
- It's Mom! I'm not here.

81
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:49,750
Hey, mister!

82
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,220
Open the door!

83
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,260
Mister, is So-mi here?

84
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,490
- She's not here.
- I heard voices inside.

85
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,900
Why won't you open the door then?

86
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,070
JUNG So-mi,
I know you're in there!

87
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,340
Get out here, now!

88
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,110
Open the door.

89
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,410
I said, open it.

90
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,680
What are you doing?

91
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,720
JUNG So-mi.

92
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,730
You better come out
right now!

93
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:38,970
What...

94
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,330
She's really not here?

95
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,380
I'm warning you.

96
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,250
Stop luring my kid in here.

97
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,990
If you touch her, I'll kill you.

98
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:00,160
You can go screw married women,

99
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,190
but don't mess with kids.

100
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,230
I'll rip your balls off.

101
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,170
If you're that desperate,
then ask me out.

102
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:16,740
You're easy on the eyes.
I'd date you.

103
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:18,700
Well?

104
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,410
Pussy.

105
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,160
Isn't it pretty?

106
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,030
Don't touch other people's things.

107
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,130
You had fun?

108
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:20,900
Tell your boss
that I'll get his ass.

109
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:25,110
Good luck with that shit.

110
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,730
You lost all the goods I gave you.

111
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,300
Did you think
I'd go hire you a private eye?

112
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,700
I sent my boys after it.

113
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,310
I'll find those bitches...

114
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:56,280
This is why you scumbags
can't be trusted.

115
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:03,310
Goddamn useless
developing country idiots.

116
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,580
Who brought this fucker?

117
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,290
Fucking Vietcong.

118
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:19,190
160 million Chinese do weed,
26 on meth, and 11 on heroin.

119
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:22,300
It's a gold mine.
The UN says so.

120
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,640
Three days,

121
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:28,040
I'll hold those Chinese here.

122
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,970
You better find that sample heroin.

123
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,370
Or I'll donate you two to
the Bodies exhibition.

124
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,910
That's your specialty,
so you get my drift.

125
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:47,420
A military in power is
what this damn country needs.

126
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,800
You fucking little whore!

127
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,170
Are you crazy?

128
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,210
Where are the goods?

129
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,880
Answer me.

130
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,820
I did all the work.

131
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,190
I deserve half.

132
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,690
- Don't l?
- Fucking bitch!

133
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:26,090
Listen up, Hyo-jung.

134
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:31,170
20 percent is enough.
You have one day.

135
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,470
Don't bullshit me.

136
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:38,030
I can just sell it all and run!

137
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,440
You're asking for it,
aren't you?

138
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,070
Do you know who they are?

139
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,450
Don't fuck it up.

140
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,420
Fucking tramp.

141
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,090
Like mother, like daughter.

142
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,600
Go outside and play.

143
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,850
I promise.

144
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,010
I'll go when Mom's friends leave.

145
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,080
You know what your nickname is?

146
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,320
The "pawnshop ghost".

147
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,790
Guess my nickname.

148
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,330
What is it?

149
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,700
I'm not telling.

150
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,200
It's "garbage".

151
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,220
My aunt told me,

152
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:06,320
Mom kicked a garbage can
when she got pregnant with me.

153
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,060
It's been garbage ever since.
Funny, right?

154
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,700
Go to sleep.

155
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:20,470
Pawnshop ghost and garbage.
Sounds like a rock band.

156
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,410
Doesn't it?

157
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:26,040
I feel like playing
video games...

158
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:57,710
I DIDN'T HAVE MY SUPPLIES,
BUT ISN'T IT STILL CUTE?

159
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,650
KIM YEON-SU

160
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,650
What's wrong with you?

161
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,290
What's your mom's phone number?

162
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:30,130
- Answer me!
- Stop hitting her so much!

163
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,930
Look at my son's scars!

164
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,540
You can't even keep
these bums away,

165
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,870
with all the taxes
I'm paying?

166
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,680
Did your mom tell you
to glare at adults?

167
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,440
Did you steal his bag?

168
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,730
I didn't steal it.

169
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,460
I just wanted to compare it with mine.

170
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,830
You don't have a bag, you bum!

171
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,860
Don't touch!
You'll get germs!

172
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,770
You need an adult here
to settle this.

173
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,030
Isn't your mom home?

174
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,600
That's your dad?

175
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,380
Excuse me, sir!

176
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,020
- Sir!
- Over here!

177
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,720
Hey!

178
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:26,920
He's not your dad?

179
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,430
Hello?

180
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,770
- Where are you?
- Woah.

181
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:16,100
Sounds like he really beat you hard.

182
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:19,240
You're smoking it up
while I'm out working.

183
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:22,940
- Mom and Dad would be proud
- Not so hard...

184
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:25,880
That's just life.

185
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:29,010
Do-chi called.
He found the bitch.

186
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,120
Who?

187
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,190
The fucking dancer?

188
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,940
Are you mad?

189
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,790
That's why you shouldn't steal.

190
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,740
How much is what she just took?

191
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,170
Leave her be.

192
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,940
Kids will learn
from their mistakes.

193
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,040
Parenting isn't just giving birth.

194
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:35,360
She's always by herself.

195
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:40,020
Bring her around more often,
like the other dads.

196
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,090
It's on me.

197
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,320
Give me back my MP3.

198
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,620
I don't have money,
so take this.

199
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,170
My lucky card.
It beats everything.

200
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,460
Bye.

201
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,250
DARK KNIGHT

202
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,620
Mister?

203
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,990
I embarrass you too, right?

204
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,850
That's why you ignored me?

205
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,460
It's okay.

206
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,020
My teacher and
all the kids do that, too.

207
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:59,440
Mom said that if I get lost,

208
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,530
I should forget our address
and phone number.

209
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,910
She gets drunk and
says we should die.

210
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:12,010
Even though that pig called me a bum...

211
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,550
You're meaner.

212
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,250
But I don't hate you.

213
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:24,190
Because if I do,
I won't have anyone I like.

214
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:28,600
Thinking about it hurts me here.

215
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,170
So I won't hate you.

216
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,530
Mom?

217
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:09,340
We're looking for something.

218
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,060
You're going to help us.

219
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:24,280
Do I look like a
fucking school bully?

220
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,260
Get out.

221
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,830
Did you find it?

222
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,140
The thing is...

223
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:54,310
Things got a bit interesting up here.

224
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,610
- Who are you?
- You came to the wrong place.

225
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,840
I didn't call the cops,
so just go.

226
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,280
How thoughtful of you.

227
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,580
We'll go once we get our goods.

228
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:43,630
PARK Hyo-jung gave you
a camera bag yesterday.

229
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:44,690
Hand it over.

230
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,030
A day is worth half-month interest.

231
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:50,170
80 dollars capital
and 4 percent interest.

232
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:51,800
Deals must be made in person.

233
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,740
Is that so?

234
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:57,880
I had no idea.

235
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,210
But what will we do?

236
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,180
Get over here.
Say something!

237
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,080
- Mom!
- Talk!

238
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,020
- Don't! Stop it!
- Go ahead, talk!

239
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,850
- You little bitch!
- Mommy!

240
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,020
Are you okay?
Mommy!

241
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,860
Wake up, Mom!

242
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,960
Mommy!

243
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,960
She can't go right now.

244
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,000
How much?

245
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,270
You want these two to die for that?

246
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,500
Fucking...

247
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,990
Mister! Mister!

248
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,840
Save me!

249
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,200
Mister!

250
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,010
Mister...

251
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,050
You couldn't handle one fucking guy?

252
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,560
Boxing? Karate?

253
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,050
Was he that good?

254
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:31,630
I'm telling you,
you should've seen him.

255
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,930
He was so fucking fast.

256
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,400
Don't you think...

257
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:40,200
- Forget it.
- No big deal.

258
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:42,000
This is good.

259
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,640
We needed a fall guy anyway.

260
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,760
You're saying...

261
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,460
Your neighbor and her kid got
kidnapped by drug dealers?

262
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:07,690
Is that right?

263
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:10,090
- Yes.
- Is she really your neighbor?

264
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:13,600
Just give me your address.
I'll send a squad car.

265
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,330
Hello?

266
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,880
You can't give me
your address, can you?

267
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,520
Look, sir.

268
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,750
If you're that lonely,
call information instead.

269
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,810
They have prettier voices,
all right?

270
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:49,910
I'll do as you say.

271
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:52,910
Don't hurt them.

272
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,720
You made the
right choice, mister.

273
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,650
You just have to
do one delivery for us.

274
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,970
- What do you think?
- Impressive.

275
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,300
Open the glove box.

276
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,480
OUT OF ORDER

277
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:29,040
Go to the driving range and
ask for OH Myung-kyu.

278
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,380
Deliver it at 6 P.M.
Be on time.

279
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,380
Toss the phone once I hang up.

280
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,580
When will you let them go?

281
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:42,720
There's a soup place
around the corner.

282
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,790
I got a table at 9 P.M.,
so look there.

283
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,190
Look at these petty thieves.

284
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:31,100
- Where's the murder, the meat?
- You wish.

285
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,500
Fuck my life.

286
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:37,500
This is NOH, DEA department.

287
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,170
That's right.

288
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:20,280
Welcome. Come this way.

289
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:23,150
Over here.

290
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,730
Nice to meet you.

291
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:33,090
- Was that right?
- Yes.

292
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:35,200
- Good.
- Have a seat.

293
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,640
- He came alone?
- Yes, sir.

294
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:47,340
These Chinese got spunk, don't they?

295
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,580
Hurry up, then.

296
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:58,290
Tell him it's imported
and I hope he likes it.

297
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:00,690
Be polite. Dandy, you hear?

298
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:01,460
Yes, sir.

299
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,260
Go on!

300
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:17,500
Saw some gangster films, eh?
May as well be at a funeral.

301
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,350
- Should I translate?
- If you want to die.

302
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,320
Does he think it's poisoned?

303
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,980
Try the goddamn tea.

304
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:30,180
Are you OH Myung-kyu?

305
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,830
I delivered it as promised.

306
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,860
Hand them over.

307
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:42,430
What is this?

308
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:46,870
- Who the hell sent you?
- I made the delivery.

309
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,570
- Keep your word.
- What is he saying?

310
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,380
Did you get the goods?

311
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,740
Man-seok?

312
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:16,140
You trying to dump this shit on me?

313
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,230
Why not?

314
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,660
You thought I'd just let you
take my business?

315
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:23,070
You think you'll get away with this?

316
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,210
Mr. OH.

317
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,180
Mister fucking OH Myung-kyu.

318
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,510
One word of advice.

319
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:35,050
Kiss all the ass you can,
but you're fucked.

320
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:36,850
You got that, bitch?

321
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,160
If you want to live, then run!

322
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,260
You fucking gold mother fucker!

323
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,960
Mother fucker!

324
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,000
Hey, Chinese major.

325
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,700
There goes your paycheck!

326
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:58,310
You fucker!

327
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,510
Get over here!

328
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,500
Grab him!

329
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,290
What the fuck?

330
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:10,120
Get my jacket!

331
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:19,200
Goddamn bastards.

332
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:21,970
Hey!

333
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:24,240
Throw him to the cops.

334
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:29,170
You three go this way.

335
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:31,840
Block the exits!

336
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,130
What the hell?

337
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,840
LEE Kwang-su.

338
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,140
JU Jae-young.

339
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,850
KIM Bu-seong.

340
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,790
- PARK Man-kyu.
- Drip on the floor, you die!

341
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:30,760
LEE Won-hyung.

342
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:34,120
You better not water it down!

343
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:39,230
- Fucking bitches won't answer me.
- We got you.

344
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,100
No small talk!

345
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,870
- No exchanging of urine!
- Yes, sir.

346
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:45,700
Do as you're told!

347
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,870
- No organs?
- That's right.

348
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:51,010
Cornea, liver, kidneys,
skin tissue.

349
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:53,710
Took everything worth any money.

350
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,440
But harvesting isn't OH's style.

351
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,020
- Who's that?
- Came out of nowhere.

352
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,820
We're looking him up,

353
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:05,350
but we can't link him to
OH Myung-kyu.

354
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:15,730
It was crammed inside the furnace.

355
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,940
It's too little.
They already took it.

356
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,570
Yeah.

357
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,070
Name is CHA Tae-shik.

358
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,100
Lives in Yongsan, Seoul.

359
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,880
No drug offense and tested clean.

360
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:33,020
But from 1998 to 2006,

361
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,820
- there's no record for him.
- No record?

362
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:38,260
These pricks never register,
so dig into his connections.

363
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,620
Just find his link to OH Myung-kyu.

364
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,690
This is a murder case.

365
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,510
21 Dongja district in Yongsan...

366
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:03,070
A pawnshop?

367
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,550
A vein burst in her nostrils.

368
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,490
You know what that means?

369
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,420
Her heart was beating when
they got her eyes.

370
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:17,000
Ripped out of her head while
she was alive!

371
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,360
The drugs aren't half your problems.

372
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:24,290
You keep playing quiet
and you're fucked!

373
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,530
Understand?

374
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:28,770
Excuse me, Detective.

375
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:33,210
- Don't we get any snacks?
- Snacks?

376
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,280
You fucking want snacks?

377
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:38,920
Which one's CHA Tae-shik?

378
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,910
- Why?
- There's a lock on his record.

379
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:43,880
A lock?

380
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,650
Here's the stuff on OH Myung-kyu.

381
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:48,190
Tell Chi-gon I need to see him.

382
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,700
But he won't be back
any time soon...

383
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,530
DARK KNIGHT

384
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,970
Escaped from Baron's castle.
Disappears into shadows at sunrise.

385
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:08,210
All right, let's just eat first.

386
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,270
Excuse me.

387
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,650
I'm left-handed.

388
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:17,120
Nothing beats hunger, eh?

389
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,850
He finally speaks!

390
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,020
We're making progress.

391
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,090
Let's eat and get this over with.

392
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:48,620
Holy shit!

393
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,200
- Hello?
- What the...

394
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:10,840
- Who is this?
- I'm just the Chinese major.

395
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:14,070
All I did was ask for some food.

396
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:15,550
Where's Detective PARK?

397
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:16,950
Put him on the phone!

398
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,740
Please don't kill me...

399
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:30,090
Young man!

400
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,660
Can you see that plate number?

401
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:38,870
What?

402
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:42,140
See if it's my son's van,
would you?

403
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,380
What's the number?

404
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:45,870
It's 5124.

405
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,550
It's right, 5124!

406
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:57,610
Let go of me!

407
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:35,690
Let's go meet Mommy.

408
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:16,900
- Come up.
- What about my mom?

409
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:19,060
You don't come up,
you won't see her.

410
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:35,750
Open the door!

411
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:37,520
Please! Let me out!

412
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:41,420
Open the door!

413
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,240
6:41 P.M.

414
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:37,280
43

415
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:43,750
45 and 18 seconds.

416
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,490
Six cops hospitalized

417
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:49,830
and OH's files stolen in
4 minutes 30 seconds.

418
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:51,560
Jung-ho's teeth are out.

419
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,600
KWON's knee is busted.

420
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:56,170
This is one complicated mother fucker.

421
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:00,360
The lock code on him is 011.
Guess who?

422
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:02,440
Military intelligence.

423
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:07,070
A lock on a civilian file,
that's a first.

424
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:08,610
I'm tingling with curiosity.

425
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:14,050
There is one option.
What do you want to do?

426
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:17,320
Remember the short track
incident with Ono?

427
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:21,820
A third-grade kid from Korea
sent Bush an E-mail.

428
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,790
It read, "I'll kill you".

429
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,450
So the FBI asked us to look into it.

430
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:30,440
The dirty ones are
always more suspicious.

431
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:34,100
- So you're saying...
- We'll send one as CHA Tae-shik.

432
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:37,070
They send us a request,
and it's a one deal.

433
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:40,640
Even the NIS will have to
release the information.

434
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:42,640
Obama...To Obama?

435
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,550
You know Obama's E-mail, you idiot?

436
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:48,280
To the White House.

437
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:56,360
So, is that a go?

438
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,760
Or stop?

439
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:03,670
Go, no matter what.

440
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:11,140
Please don't kill me.

441
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,310
I'm telling you the truth!

442
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,580
That bitch started it all...

443
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:20,540
That's the only reason...

444
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:23,020
Koreans never get shit done in time.

445
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:26,490
Olympics come and they finally
start building bridges.

446
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:30,360
But they're bound to collapse.

447
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:35,960
You were only trying to
earn some weed money?

448
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:38,330
And no one is behind it?

449
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,000
Fucking prick.

450
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:43,200
Then who's that pawnshop bastard?

451
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:46,670
- He's with you, isn't he?
- What pawnshop?

452
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:53,650
Counting to three.

453
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:56,520
Then I'll torch your prick.
One.

454
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,220
Please forgive me!

455
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:00,630
- Two.
- Don't kill me!

456
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:03,000
Please don't kill me!

457
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,260
- Three.
- Please don't!

458
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:17,500
You fucking startled me!

459
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,010
You're wasting your time.

460
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:21,740
The food is here.
Let's eat.

461
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,980
Can't you signal before you cut in?

462
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:32,880
I don't believe
that pawnshop bastard.

463
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:35,960
Only an idiot would not
call the cops.

464
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,600
Who cares?
This is our town.

465
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,720
- What about OH?
- I sent Ramrowan.

466
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:41,690
Alone?

467
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:44,070
This is Dolce and Gabbana!

468
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:47,200
Goddamn it.
I just bought it yesterday!

469
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:49,400
- Alone, again?
- Yes!

470
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:51,140
I told you not to send him alone.

471
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,880
That sick bastard
likes going rogue anyway.

472
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:04,290
Let me go, just this once!

473
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:07,760
I'll double what they pay you!

474
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:09,260
Please let me go!

475
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:16,690
Once we refine the meth in here,

476
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,970
we'll both be set for life!

477
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:38,090
Hey, I got it!

478
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:39,890
I got it.

479
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:42,020
The dead woman's daughter.

480
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:45,890
She ran errands for CHA
and came here sometimes.

481
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:49,100
PARK Hyo-jung and
CHA were lovers.

482
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:51,400
Kid runs the deliveries.
It's a perfect fit!

483
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:52,970
Game set!

484
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:56,800
So his lover was cut open
and her eyes ripped out?

485
00:51:57,510 --> 00:51:58,600
By CHA Tae-shik?

486
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:00,670
No?

487
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:04,840
Still no trace of the daughter?

488
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:06,940
Who's got time for her?

489
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:08,620
With OH Myung-kyu on the loose.

490
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:14,580
- Hello?
- I got it.

491
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:16,820
CHA Tae-shik.

492
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:24,370
Just get on with it!

493
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:25,270
Yes, sir.

494
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:30,980
This is the information
we received from the U.S.

495
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:34,010
CHA Tae-shik.

496
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:38,820
A Special Forces agent in
the Army Intelligence Command.

497
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:41,720
Completed classified
missions from '98 to 2006.

498
00:52:41,850 --> 00:52:45,620
A drill instructor
for specialized forces.

499
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:48,130
Received a gold star
and a military merit order.

500
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:51,820
Say hello to your guarantor,
gentlemen.

501
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,500
He's got bad credit...

502
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:57,400
Mainly enemy raids, munitions,
assassination and kidnap.

503
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,840
Specializes in secret
foreign operations.

504
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,000
How much do you need?

505
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,460
You sold this here?

506
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:07,680
There's been some kind of mix-up.

507
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:11,210
We do loans, not telephones.

508
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:14,180
Tell me who bought it
and you won't get hurt.

509
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:22,330
What are you, a cop?

510
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:26,290
The brutal training program is
said to have made

511
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:29,370
some congressman
faint from shock.

512
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:30,800
That's all we know.

513
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:36,400
Fuck!

514
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:59,460
He bought dozens at a time.
A harvester.

515
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:03,260
He deals hearts, livers,
things like that.

516
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,090
After a car accident in 2006,

517
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:09,500
CHA Tae-shik's official records
have stopped.

518
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:11,030
Gunshot wounds?

519
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:15,780
Unlike the other passenger,
CHA was taken to a military hospital.

520
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:18,280
According to his surgeon,

521
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,320
he was shot,
not in a car accident.

522
00:54:20,450 --> 00:54:23,250
Who the hell is this kid?

523
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,920
Who was the other passenger?

524
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:27,820
His wife.
She died at the scene.

525
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,130
We got a lead on CHA.

526
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,040
Where are you?

527
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:43,170
Yes.

528
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:47,140
This isn't online shopping.
We need to talk in person.

529
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:48,540
Yes.

530
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,450
The dream of a longer life,

531
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:57,450
it's not about eating health food.

532
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:01,320
We'll go over the medical records.

533
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:02,720
All right.

534
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:18,400
Come on, baby!

535
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,810
You'll ruin the taste.

536
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:24,480
Ever hear this before?

537
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,580
Dupont!

538
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:38,750
Bottoms up.

539
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:43,200
Cheers.

540
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:46,990
You're serious?

541
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:50,170
If I find him,
you'll rip up my loan contract?

542
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:55,240
- Just tell me where he is.
- Okay.

543
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:59,170
Yeah.

544
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,210
He stole their car.

545
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:03,010
We got him crossing the bridge.

546
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:05,710
And we tracked
Dochi's phone there too.

547
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:07,520
Be careful.

548
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:30,300
- Welcome back, sir.
- Thanks.

549
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:48,560
First time here?

550
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,260
They've got great girls.

551
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,230
Hot and steamy.

552
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,240
But it's looking bleak tonight.

553
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,350
It's usually a sure thing here.

554
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:09,480
Hey.

555
00:57:10,490 --> 00:57:12,220
I think tonight's a bust.

556
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:14,290
No fish in the sea.

557
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:17,220
Let's go somewhere else.

558
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:24,260
Where's Dochi?

559
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:28,770
Come out.

560
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,370
All right! Fuck!

561
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:43,180
It's chronic constipation.

562
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:44,990
Come this way.

563
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:55,620
Dialysis.

564
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:58,860
Once it hits,
you can hardly move.

565
00:57:58,970 --> 00:58:01,530
Since it's for your wife,
I'll give you a discount.

566
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:03,710
- What's your religion?
- Religion?

567
00:58:03,710 --> 00:58:06,280
You need membership at
a temple or cathedral.

568
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:08,770
Shows as voluntary donation
and what not.

569
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:11,140
Takes two months.
Are you hot?

570
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:13,110
- You're sweating like a dog.
- I'm okay.

571
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:19,980
Hello?

572
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:21,290
Yes.

573
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:24,720
I'm in the bathroom.

574
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,400
Yes.

575
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:28,630
Okay.

576
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:30,430
Who's that?

577
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:33,860
- A friend.
- A friend who?

578
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,230
Who are you? Get out!

579
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:39,740
Were we expecting another one?

580
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:41,910
Get the fuck out!

581
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:48,310
Mister! Over here!

582
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:00,590
Fucking son of a bitch.

583
00:59:06,670 --> 00:59:07,830
I won't ask twice.

584
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:10,310
Where is So-mi?

585
00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:12,740
Fuck you, bitch!

586
00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:24,520
So, you sold her...

587
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:29,390
- To the ants nest?
- I don't know!

588
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:32,290
Man-seok and Jong-seok know!

589
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:34,620
Where are they?

590
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:39,730
All right!

591
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,500
All right!

592
01:02:41,890 --> 01:02:42,910
Out of the way!

593
01:04:06,770 --> 01:04:09,070
You scared the shit out of me.

594
01:04:09,670 --> 01:04:10,640
Pawnshop.

595
01:04:11,410 --> 01:04:15,440
- Weren't you at the station?
- Why did you kill So-mi's mother?

596
01:04:15,550 --> 01:04:17,780
Hey, don't blame us.

597
01:04:17,950 --> 01:04:20,650
She actually saved three lives.

598
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:23,950
And you did the delivery,
so you killed her.

599
01:04:25,890 --> 01:04:26,690
Hello?

600
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:29,460
Hello?

601
01:04:32,830 --> 01:04:34,890
- Hello?
- Is that what you did to So-mi?

602
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:36,820
What do you think?

603
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:40,300
Her insides are shit
since they're not ripe,

604
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,300
but I can sell her corneas.

605
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:44,780
It pays surprisingly well.

606
01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:48,240
Five years in prison.
That's all I ask.

607
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:50,780
She might be waiting
when you get out.

608
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:54,950
- You only live for tomorrow.
- What?

609
01:04:56,650 --> 01:04:58,180
The ones that live for tomorrow

610
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:02,550
get fucked by the ones living
for today.

611
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:04,990
What are you babbling about?

612
01:05:05,230 --> 01:05:06,750
I only live for today.

613
01:05:08,930 --> 01:05:16,240
I'll show you just how
fucked up that can be.

614
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:21,670
He hung up on me.

615
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:26,480
Report to the NIS, is that it?

616
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:30,180
We gave you information,
but you lost the suspect and drugs.

617
01:05:30,290 --> 01:05:31,480
This can't continue.

618
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:34,750
Report all files on OH and
other connected suspects.

619
01:05:35,030 --> 01:05:37,820
Your D.A. and
I went to college together.

620
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:40,150
Let's keep things quiet.

621
01:05:41,330 --> 01:05:42,890
You're fucking kidding me.

622
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:46,630
Are you after OH Myung-kyu
or CHA Tae-shik?

623
01:05:46,970 --> 01:05:50,300
It was us that staked out
for two goddamn months.

624
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,940
And it's our boys
lying in the hospital.

625
01:05:53,810 --> 01:05:56,840
I'll catch them, write them up,
throw them in.

626
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:01,750
I'll fuck anyone in my way,
and give up my badge for it.

627
01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:04,820
You just don't get it.

628
01:06:08,990 --> 01:06:11,330
A National Defense employee
tried to sell

629
01:06:11,330 --> 01:06:13,300
information overseas in 2006.

630
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:16,990
200 million dollar's worth
of national security information.

631
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:21,730
Special forces were sent to assassinate
and recover the goods.

632
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:26,930
MOON Dal-seo, infiltration unit agent.

633
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:37,380
And CHA Tae-shik,
from extermination units.

634
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:40,880
Mission was successful,
but not without sacrifices.

635
01:07:34,410 --> 01:07:35,540
Isn't it beautiful?

636
01:07:39,950 --> 01:07:41,440
I'm so proud of it...

637
01:07:46,290 --> 01:07:48,490
So proud,
it makes me cry.

638
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:59,800
Let me hug you.
Both of you.

639
01:08:22,830 --> 01:08:24,120
- Have a nice day.
- Thanks.

640
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:26,150
- Agent CHA!
- Tae-shik!

641
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:29,680
Look at me, Tae-shik!

642
01:09:30,490 --> 01:09:32,120
Call an ambulance!
Hurry!

643
01:09:32,730 --> 01:09:33,720
Tae-shik!

644
01:09:34,030 --> 01:09:35,430
Call an ambulance!

645
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,360
Stay still!

646
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:48,710
Look at me, you bastard!

647
01:09:49,910 --> 01:09:52,040
Don't move!
You're losing blood!

648
01:10:19,410 --> 01:10:21,070
Should I ask what happened?

649
01:10:22,450 --> 01:10:23,810
Get me a gun.

650
01:10:26,950 --> 01:10:27,850
Wow.

651
01:10:30,690 --> 01:10:32,820
First words in three years,
and that's it?

652
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,150
Not a Colt or a Tokarev.

653
01:10:36,590 --> 01:10:38,590
Semi-automatic, at least 10 chambers.

654
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:42,260
Get some rest.

655
01:10:43,130 --> 01:10:44,730
Your temperature is over 104.

656
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:28,640
One by one,
I brought the abandoned mutts home.

657
01:11:30,110 --> 01:11:35,250
Now I can't tell if this is
a scrap yard or a dog pound.

658
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,620
An inch higher and
that bullet would've killed you.

659
01:11:51,870 --> 01:11:53,060
Don't do it.

660
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:57,500
I don't know what it is,
but don't do it.

661
01:12:02,150 --> 01:12:03,700
There's someone
I need to find.

662
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:10,340
It's only been a few days,

663
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:14,780
but I can't remember her face.

664
01:12:24,170 --> 01:12:26,430
I should've taken a picture.

665
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:50,460
She took out 8000 dollars.
A second-grade kid!

666
01:12:50,690 --> 01:12:52,530
Does that make sense?

667
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:56,600
Account belongs to
NAM Sung-shik, PARK's pimp.

668
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:59,290
And it matches his statement.

669
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:18,080
Mister?

670
01:14:19,350 --> 01:14:21,720
Sir, tell them I'm innocent!

671
01:14:23,950 --> 01:14:25,850
CHA Tae-shik.

672
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:30,530
I'm KIM Chi-gon of the DEA.

673
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:33,560
Remember me?

674
01:14:35,030 --> 01:14:36,500
I'll cut to the chase.

675
01:14:37,870 --> 01:14:39,230
I'm going to catch you.

676
01:14:40,370 --> 01:14:41,860
But let me ask you one thing.

677
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:46,510
You know PARK Hyo-jung's daughter,
JUNG So-mi?

678
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:49,600
Are you looking for her?

679
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:52,710
So-mi is alive.

680
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:58,020
She took out money
at an ATM near Gasan Station.

681
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,520
Tell me everything you know.

682
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:06,120
Or you'll never find her.

683
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:10,200
- Man-seok and Jong-seok.
- What?

684
01:15:10,830 --> 01:15:12,700
They sent me to OH Myung-kyu,

685
01:15:13,570 --> 01:15:15,600
and they killed So-mi's mother.

686
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:19,000
That's everything I know.

687
01:15:26,750 --> 01:15:29,050
The broker that worked for Man-Jong?

688
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:31,880
JANG Du-shik.

689
01:15:32,390 --> 01:15:34,820
Find him and start
searching Chinatown.

690
01:15:35,090 --> 01:15:36,060
Chinatown?

691
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:19,930
Is it good?

692
01:16:20,870 --> 01:16:23,240
Tell the brothers
I'm leaving with the kid.

693
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:26,000
Say good-bye.

694
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:28,270
Bye.

695
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:30,770
You're leaving?

696
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:34,050
Be good and you'll go home like her.

697
01:16:34,150 --> 01:16:35,120
Understand?

698
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:37,190
- Let's go.
- Mi-jin...

699
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:39,310
Bye.

700
01:16:43,830 --> 01:16:44,920
Thanks!

701
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:03,170
If I'm good,
I can see my mom again?

702
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:10,010
OUT OF ORDER

703
01:17:46,990 --> 01:17:48,510
Hey! JANG Du-shik!

704
01:17:49,660 --> 01:17:50,850
What?

705
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:54,730
- Who are you?
- Who do you think, moron?

706
01:17:55,030 --> 01:17:56,020
I'm Jesus.

707
01:17:57,830 --> 01:17:59,560
I'm going to make you walk.

708
01:18:03,070 --> 01:18:04,770
Help! Over here!

709
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:06,880
- This man...
- Shut your trap!

710
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,070
He's hitting a crippled man!

711
01:18:09,850 --> 01:18:10,870
It's empty.

712
01:18:27,730 --> 01:18:29,460
- Atten-hut.
- Atten-hut!

713
01:18:35,810 --> 01:18:38,500
- Run to the paddy wagon.
- Yes, sir!

714
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:41,500
- Left.
- Left!

715
01:18:41,610 --> 01:18:43,100
- Left.
- Left!

716
01:18:43,610 --> 01:18:44,380
Left!

717
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:48,550
I really don't know.

718
01:18:49,190 --> 01:18:50,680
Half are in prison.

719
01:18:51,090 --> 01:18:53,220
The rest are hiding,
so they don't contact us.

720
01:18:54,220 --> 01:18:55,560
This kid is missing.

721
01:18:56,130 --> 01:18:58,530
Are they even
selling kids these days?

722
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:04,760
Come on.

723
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,300
This isn't the eighties anymore, man.

724
01:19:10,610 --> 01:19:12,130
Of course, they've done worse.

725
01:19:12,810 --> 01:19:15,840
But this isn't it.
She's just an ant.

726
01:19:16,110 --> 01:19:17,080
An ant?

727
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:20,210
Yeah, an ant.

728
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:21,770
OUT OF ORDER

729
01:19:31,730 --> 01:19:33,630
It's the Chinese mafia system.

730
01:19:33,860 --> 01:19:35,020
That's right, the Chinese mafia.

731
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:39,200
All those social outcasts, you know?

732
01:19:40,270 --> 01:19:42,000
People in debt!

733
01:19:42,510 --> 01:19:46,140
They take their kids and
send them on deliveries.

734
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:48,900
Who suspects a kid, right?
They're just kids!

735
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:52,110
Cheap to maintain,
safe from the cops.

736
01:19:52,450 --> 01:19:53,940
It's the perfect solution!

737
01:19:56,090 --> 01:19:58,050
And it's impossible to track.

738
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:54,630
Excuse me, sir.

739
01:21:54,770 --> 01:21:55,500
Hey!

740
01:21:57,510 --> 01:21:58,500
Code 402!

741
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:00,270
Freeze!

742
01:22:17,790 --> 01:22:18,620
Put your hands up!

743
01:22:25,970 --> 01:22:27,300
Stop right there!

744
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:43,040
Kids are so dramatic.

745
01:24:45,410 --> 01:24:47,670
Hey, kid!

746
01:24:49,410 --> 01:24:50,740
Just take her away.

747
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:56,780
Get back to work!

748
01:27:55,430 --> 01:27:57,630
What is it? I'm busy.

749
01:28:04,470 --> 01:28:05,300
Hello?

750
01:28:08,210 --> 01:28:09,200
So-mi.

751
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:12,810
Bring her to me.

752
01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:16,810
Pawnshop?

753
01:28:18,090 --> 01:28:19,650
How'd you get over there?

754
01:28:23,130 --> 01:28:25,120
Man-seok!

755
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:29,990
- Who was that?
- This is your last chance.

756
01:28:31,570 --> 01:28:33,560
Bring her to me within the hour.

757
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:37,070
I asked you who that was,
mother fucker!

758
01:28:44,610 --> 01:28:46,240
You have no idea
who you're up against.

759
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:50,410
Touch one hair on my brother's body,

760
01:28:51,150 --> 01:28:53,590
and I'll rip her eyes and guts out!

761
01:28:56,490 --> 01:28:58,960
You fucking bastard!

762
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:08,430
Tell Ramrowan to rip her eyes out.

763
01:29:25,090 --> 01:29:26,110
What are you doing?

764
01:29:32,630 --> 01:29:34,190
When the kids died,

765
01:29:36,770 --> 01:29:38,230
you took out their organs.

766
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:44,270
Sent the liver to one district,
the eyes to another...

767
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,970
And the heart to Seoul.

768
01:29:52,180 --> 01:29:53,310
Isn't that right?

769
01:29:54,150 --> 01:29:55,380
I didn't do it.

770
01:29:56,420 --> 01:29:57,820
Those young children,

771
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:04,990
wandering the country
even after death...

772
01:30:08,970 --> 01:30:11,200
Did that ever cross your mind?

773
01:30:12,070 --> 01:30:13,190
What about you?

774
01:30:14,470 --> 01:30:17,410
You ever wonder
how much they're worth?

775
01:30:18,370 --> 01:30:21,000
Even their parents
don't want them anymore.

776
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:24,270
It's a win-win situation.

777
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:26,650
Am I right?

778
01:30:29,220 --> 01:30:30,240
Wrong.

779
01:30:33,220 --> 01:30:34,520
Just now,

780
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:40,030
you should've apologized to those kids.

781
01:30:43,330 --> 01:30:44,990
Mother fucker.

782
01:30:47,470 --> 01:30:49,400
If anything happens to me,

783
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:51,870
you'll never see that bitch again.

784
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:53,440
You get me?

785
01:30:54,810 --> 01:30:56,040
Even if I find So-mi,

786
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:00,410
you two are still dead.

787
01:31:10,690 --> 01:31:11,520
Hey.

788
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:15,660
Wait!

789
01:31:26,410 --> 01:31:27,380
Fuck!

790
01:31:28,780 --> 01:31:30,840
Goddamn it!

791
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:34,720
Yeah.

792
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:38,390
Hello?

793
01:31:45,730 --> 01:31:47,250
Say something, you asshole!

794
01:31:47,430 --> 01:31:48,800
Mother fucker!

795
01:32:15,690 --> 01:32:16,750
Hold onto it.

796
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:22,290
Time to get back home.

797
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:25,760
Where's my mom?

798
01:32:45,150 --> 01:32:46,020
Mom?

799
01:32:50,130 --> 01:32:52,920
Mommy's right here.

800
01:32:56,400 --> 01:33:00,390
I took her heart out.

801
01:33:01,470 --> 01:33:05,910
So Mommy is right here.

802
01:33:08,310 --> 01:33:09,970
Let's shake hands.

803
01:33:11,350 --> 01:33:12,250
Why?

804
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:15,020
Don't you want to?

805
01:33:23,730 --> 01:33:27,030
You said I could see my mom again.

806
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:30,620
He's lying, right?

807
01:33:30,870 --> 01:33:32,630
She's not dead.

808
01:33:32,770 --> 01:33:35,540
She's not dead, right?

809
01:33:35,540 --> 01:33:37,170
She's alive.

810
01:33:37,540 --> 01:33:41,810
Mister, you're lying, right?

811
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:48,450
My mom is alive!

812
01:33:48,450 --> 01:33:51,720
Where is she? Let me see her.

813
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:53,190
Please, mister!

814
01:34:00,230 --> 01:34:01,460
Shit.

815
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:03,090
Coming through!

816
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:05,560
Identifications.

817
01:34:06,570 --> 01:34:07,560
Inspect these people.

818
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:12,770
Granny.

819
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:15,380
We know everything.

820
01:34:16,980 --> 01:34:18,280
Where are the kids?

821
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:21,850
Goddamn it.

822
01:34:21,850 --> 01:34:23,280
Where the hell are they?

823
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:25,910
Detective NOH!

824
01:34:38,930 --> 01:34:39,940
Yeah.

825
01:34:39,940 --> 01:34:41,770
- What did you find?
- I got a name.

826
01:34:41,870 --> 01:34:45,710
OH Sang-man, a surgeon.
Served 3 and a half for drug use.

827
01:34:45,810 --> 01:34:47,210
Known as "500".

828
01:34:47,580 --> 01:34:50,840
His goal is to cut open 500 bodies.

829
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:52,680
Track him down.

830
01:35:36,530 --> 01:35:39,020
This is it? Just one guy?

831
01:35:39,460 --> 01:35:40,520
There you are.

832
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,260
Who the fuck are you?

833
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:48,430
Why did you come
all the way here for her?

834
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:51,460
I'm her next-door neighbor.

835
01:35:54,410 --> 01:35:55,430
Fucking idiot.

836
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:57,340
Her next-door neighbor?

837
01:35:59,780 --> 01:36:01,680
You're fucking insane.

838
01:36:02,490 --> 01:36:05,110
- Where's Jong-seok?
- So-mi first.

839
01:36:11,690 --> 01:36:12,680
Hey.

840
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:14,330
Grab it.

841
01:36:22,770 --> 01:36:24,300
Out of the way, moron!

842
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:31,900
I'll just stay over here.

843
01:36:34,950 --> 01:36:35,920
Catch.

844
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,020
Strike!

845
01:37:14,190 --> 01:37:16,750
She went to heaven to find her mommy.

846
01:37:18,530 --> 01:37:21,660
But she can't find her
without her eyes.

847
01:37:22,300 --> 01:37:24,390
You messed with the wrong person.

848
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:27,590
Next-door neighbor?

849
01:37:29,470 --> 01:37:31,840
You think this is some fucking joke?

850
01:37:35,210 --> 01:37:36,580
Where's my brother?

851
01:37:38,510 --> 01:37:40,210
Where the fuck is my brother?

852
01:37:51,090 --> 01:37:53,650
- How many cavities do you have?
- What?

853
01:37:55,900 --> 01:37:57,760
I run a pawnshop.

854
01:38:00,100 --> 01:38:01,760
I take gold teeth.

855
01:38:10,110 --> 01:38:12,100
I'll keep the gold teeth.

856
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:17,180
And I'll chew up everything else.

857
01:39:44,870 --> 01:39:45,970
Fuck!

858
01:41:33,780 --> 01:41:35,680
Where the fuck did he get a gun?

859
01:41:36,620 --> 01:41:37,880
Is he a cop?

860
01:41:38,350 --> 01:41:40,460
Move your fucking ass, moron!

861
01:41:40,460 --> 01:41:42,650
Sorry, sir.
I got shot earlier...

862
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:44,520
You won't die, bitch.

863
01:41:44,690 --> 01:41:45,990
- Hurry up!
- Yes, sir.

864
01:43:45,580 --> 01:43:47,140
Get in the fucking car!

865
01:44:13,980 --> 01:44:15,070
Fuck!

866
01:44:22,850 --> 01:44:24,110
Son of a bitch.

867
01:44:38,130 --> 01:44:39,260
Police?

868
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:42,540
Someone's getting killed!
Get over here!

869
01:44:43,210 --> 01:44:45,710
Just trace the call
and get over here!

870
01:44:45,710 --> 01:44:47,680
Fuck, he's here!

871
01:44:47,980 --> 01:44:50,340
Hurry up, assholes!

872
01:44:52,680 --> 01:44:53,650
He's fucking here!

873
01:45:09,200 --> 01:45:11,220
You moron!

874
01:45:11,700 --> 01:45:15,000
It's bulletproof, mother fucker!

875
01:45:23,550 --> 01:45:24,570
Shoot!

876
01:45:25,380 --> 01:45:27,210
Shoot me, bitch!

877
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:33,150
Once the cops are here,
you're finished.

878
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:36,520
I'm not going anywhere!

879
01:45:43,330 --> 01:45:46,560
I said it's fucking bulletproof!

880
01:46:13,030 --> 01:46:14,960
One more bullet left.

881
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:29,600
Mister...

882
01:49:06,030 --> 01:49:08,630
Did you come to save me?

883
01:49:12,710 --> 01:49:16,170
You came to save me, right?

884
01:49:22,550 --> 01:49:23,710
Stay there.

885
01:49:25,990 --> 01:49:27,420
You'll get blood on you.

886
01:49:38,270 --> 01:49:39,390
Mister!

887
01:49:40,170 --> 01:49:43,000
You came to save me!

888
01:49:43,470 --> 01:49:44,600
Right?

889
01:49:45,410 --> 01:49:47,470
Right, mister?

890
01:50:31,220 --> 01:50:33,190
He got his eyes ripped out.

891
01:50:50,010 --> 01:50:50,940
Put her in with him.

892
01:51:26,240 --> 01:51:27,870
Could I ask you a favor?

893
01:51:40,290 --> 01:51:41,590
Little girl.

894
01:51:43,590 --> 01:51:46,060
You really got into trouble this time.

895
01:52:11,950 --> 01:52:13,280
I'm sorry.

896
01:52:15,060 --> 01:52:19,790
I'm sorry for
pretending to not know you.

897
01:52:23,130 --> 01:52:25,330
If I want to know you too much,

898
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:28,670
I can't help not wanting to.

899
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:30,960
What's that supposed to mean?

900
01:52:34,910 --> 01:52:36,340
I don't know either.

901
01:52:36,910 --> 01:52:39,310
I've never seen you smile before.

902
01:52:45,820 --> 01:52:47,450
You're on your own now.

903
01:52:50,460 --> 01:52:51,890
You can do it, right?

904
01:53:03,510 --> 01:53:04,700
Just once...

905
01:53:11,110 --> 01:53:12,880
Let me hug you once.

906
01:53:19,090 --> 01:53:20,990
Let me hug you, just once.

907
01:54:01,360 --> 01:54:02,990
Mister...

908
01:54:03,670 --> 01:54:05,030
Are you crying?

909
01:55:00,290 --> 01:55:08,560
THE MAN FROM NOWHERE

910
01:55:14,900 --> 01:55:19,270
CHA Tae-shik - WON Bin
So-mi - KIM Sae-ron

911
