1
00:00:39,468 --> 00:00:40,552
Get to it.

2
00:02:25,444 --> 00:02:26,580
Jackson! No!

3
00:02:51,687 --> 00:02:53,710
Ahh.

4
00:03:04,627 --> 00:03:06,525
Roger.

5
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:11,591
You're a wonderful man, yes,
and you're a great lawyer.

6
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,594
We're just not meant to be together.

7
00:03:17,618 --> 00:03:20,558
No, I don't wanna marry you!
Are you crazy?

8
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,560
The hell's the matter with you?

9
00:03:23,582 --> 00:03:24,708
Roger, we're done.

10
00:03:25,668 --> 00:03:27,597
Oh, my God.

11
00:03:29,703 --> 00:03:32,611
Fuck! God!

12
00:03:33,664 --> 00:03:35,645
Hurgh!

13
00:03:35,677 --> 00:03:37,595
Fucking men!

14
00:03:45,635 --> 00:03:48,553
- Did he cry?
- Yeah, he cried. He laughed.

15
00:03:48,585 --> 00:03:50,586
He yelled at me.
You know, whatever.

16
00:03:50,618 --> 00:03:52,693
- You broke his heart, Mama.
- I did the right thing.

17
00:03:52,724 --> 00:03:55,633
- Ally, garbage!
- It just wasn't right... Oh, hey, Bryan.

18
00:03:55,664 --> 00:03:57,646
- Can somebody else do it?
- Let her shine!

19
00:03:57,677 --> 00:03:59,637
It's your fucking turn!

20
00:03:59,668 --> 00:04:01,681
- Oh, my God!
- Who's he talking to?

21
00:04:01,712 --> 00:04:03,599
OK, I'll see you upstairs.

22
00:04:03,631 --> 00:04:05,747
Come on, Bryan!
She's performing tonight!

23
00:04:06,665 --> 00:04:08,729
Here we go. Taking out the trash.
Wipe your mouth.

24
00:04:08,761 --> 00:04:10,742
You can go early if you finish your job.

25
00:04:10,773 --> 00:04:13,640
Well, you gotta keep your mouth clean.
OK?

26
00:05:02,718 --> 00:05:05,679
Ohh. Where the fuck are we?

27
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,840
We are uh...east of the city.

28
00:05:10,621 --> 00:05:12,654
- Is there any more?
- No.

29
00:05:12,685 --> 00:05:13,843
No, sorry, Jack.

30
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:18,608
And it's... It's about an hour, 40,
with traffic till we get there.

31
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,641
- Really?
- Yeah.

32
00:05:20,672 --> 00:05:22,779
Think we can find something around here?

33
00:05:23,686 --> 00:05:25,719
No, I'll find something.
I'll find something.

34
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,660
How's your kid?
How old is he now?

35
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:31,714
- He is 17.
- Fuck me.

36
00:05:31,745 --> 00:05:35,801
And he got a scholarship
to play baseball in college already, man.

37
00:05:35,832 --> 00:05:38,804
- Wow, that's great.
- I'm proud of him.

38
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:42,735
My little guy is not so little any more.

39
00:05:42,766 --> 00:05:44,841
I don't wanna go home.

40
00:05:46,718 --> 00:05:48,814
Wish I could find you a spot.

41
00:05:48,845 --> 00:05:51,869
- Sorry, Jack, I don't know this area.
- Would you make a right here?

42
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:53,808
- You sure?
- Yeah.

43
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:55,872
All right.

44
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,803
Here we go.
That looks like a fucking bar.

45
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:01,805
- Here?
- What's that say? "Bleu Bleu."

46
00:06:01,836 --> 00:06:03,797
Here, let me just try this.

47
00:06:08,843 --> 00:06:11,710
Oh, shit.

48
00:06:11,857 --> 00:06:13,785
Wait, wait.

49
00:06:13,816 --> 00:06:16,892
- My man, my man, I... Aren't you like...
- This is a bar, right?

50
00:06:17,674 --> 00:06:19,895
- Yeah, but not your kind of place.
- They got alcohol?

51
00:06:20,677 --> 00:06:22,721
- Well, yeah, but...
- Oh, it's my kind of place.

52
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:24,869
Oh, shit! This is crazy!

53
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,736
How are you doin', papo?

54
00:06:27,768 --> 00:06:29,770
How am I doin'?
All right, if I can get a drink.

55
00:06:29,801 --> 00:06:31,687
- You good?
- Yeah.

56
00:06:31,865 --> 00:06:34,763
- Oh, yeah. There's the bar.
- This is my home girl Giselle.

57
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:36,776
- How you doin'?
- Oh, yeah. That's Jack.

58
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:42,719
Can we get this man
anything he wants, please?

59
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,918
Can I get a gin on the rocks...

60
00:06:50,695 --> 00:06:51,853
Papo, wow.

61
00:06:52,718 --> 00:06:54,709
Oh, my gosh.
I'm freaking out right now.

62
00:06:54,741 --> 00:06:56,857
- Hey, is this a drag bar?
- Yeah, papo. Yeah, yeah.

63
00:06:56,888 --> 00:07:00,778
But, look, we do this every Friday night.
Yo, it's crazy. It's so lit, though.

64
00:07:00,809 --> 00:07:03,854
I thought maybe I was in
some sort of hallucinogenic state.

65
00:07:03,885 --> 00:07:05,845
- Or something.
- No, no. All are welcome.

66
00:07:05,877 --> 00:07:07,733
A dress or something.

67
00:07:07,764 --> 00:07:09,766
Gonna have something?
Let me get you a drink.

68
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:11,736
OK. Yeah, um, wow.

69
00:07:11,945 --> 00:07:15,792
You better kill 'em tonight.
All you ladies, kill it tonight, OK?

70
00:07:15,823 --> 00:07:16,887
- I'm ready.
- I always do!

71
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:19,744
Make sure you've turned in
your music already.

72
00:07:19,775 --> 00:07:21,840
Don't make me
have to come get you tonight.

73
00:07:21,871 --> 00:07:23,873
This is a professional show.

74
00:07:26,824 --> 00:07:28,961
Oh, yes! Oh, you stayed!

75
00:07:29,743 --> 00:07:31,829
- That's good. I like it.
- Everything good? You good?

76
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,861
Yeah, I was just talking to Nicki.
You know Nicki?

77
00:07:33,893 --> 00:07:36,926
- Hello, Nicki. How you doin', baby?
- She's telling me her life story.

78
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,763
- Fascinating.
- My home girl's about to perform.

79
00:07:39,794 --> 00:07:41,984
Y'all know her well
because she used to work here as a server.

80
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:47,937
But, tonight, the only thing she's serving
are some fabulous, French live vocals.

81
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:56,810
Is she really singing,
or is it one of those karaoke things?

82
00:07:56,841 --> 00:07:59,823
No, she's really singing, papo.
I promise you. Watch this. Watch.

83
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:46,905
Would anybody like
some French tips tonight?

84
00:10:54,135 --> 00:10:56,929
Yes, baby! Yes, baby!

85
00:10:58,097 --> 00:10:59,160
Oh, fuck.

86
00:10:59,942 --> 00:11:01,955
- Oh, papo, you crying?
- A little bit.

87
00:11:03,175 --> 00:11:05,104
You have...
You have to meet her.

88
00:11:05,135 --> 00:11:07,033
- What's that?
- You have to meet her!

89
00:11:07,064 --> 00:11:09,076
- Oh, no, I can't meet her.
- Yes! Come on.

90
00:11:09,108 --> 00:11:13,018
Donte, you got a rag, honey? Thank you.

91
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:16,177
Miss Ally, now you sang in French,
you gonna pick something else next week?

92
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,981
- I don't know.
- Look at her, doing languages.

93
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,952
- Do Moroccan.
- No!

94
00:11:20,983 --> 00:11:22,985
- This is my friend, Jackson Maine.
- Hey.

95
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,987
- This is Jackson Maine.
- Hey. How are you?

96
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:28,157
- Hey! Oh, my God!
- Right? This is my friend, Ally.

97
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,200
- Hi.
- Hey.

98
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:32,057
- I thought that might be you.
- What'd you say?

99
00:11:32,088 --> 00:11:34,132
- I thought that might be you.
- That's me.

100
00:11:34,163 --> 00:11:36,039
Thank you! Do you wanna sit down?

101
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,115
- No! You've been on your feet all night.
- No! You're our guest.

102
00:11:39,146 --> 00:11:41,169
- You sure you don't mind?
- A little drink?

103
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,026
- I'm here watching the show - you guys.
- Word.

104
00:11:44,057 --> 00:11:45,152
- Yeah, yeah.
- Sign my boob?

105
00:11:45,183 --> 00:11:47,133
- Sure. Yeah, I can do that.
- Oh, my God!

106
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:50,053
- Give me a sharpie!
- You know, it's BYOB around here.

107
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,982
- Yeah?
- "Bring your own boobs."

108
00:11:52,013 --> 00:11:55,027
Oh, God!
Oh, those aren't really her boobs?

109
00:11:56,226 --> 00:11:58,039
Wow!

110
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:00,010
So, why are you in here, hon?

111
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,157
- Sorry?
- What brings you here?

112
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:05,025
I was playing right around here tonight.
I'm a musician.

113
00:12:05,056 --> 00:12:08,122
- How'd your show go?
- I think it went all right.

114
00:12:09,165 --> 00:12:11,125
- OK, here we go. All right.
- Thank you!

115
00:12:11,156 --> 00:12:13,148
- That's all right?
- Oh, my.

116
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:15,139
- Aahh.
- Which one should I do?

117
00:12:15,171 --> 00:12:17,130
- Do 'em both! I don't care!
- Slut!

118
00:12:17,162 --> 00:12:19,194
- Why don't I do it across?
- Bitch, Jackson Maine!

119
00:12:19,226 --> 00:12:21,134
- I'll just...
- Oh, my!

120
00:12:21,165 --> 00:12:25,034
Ohh, she will stop at nothing.

121
00:12:25,065 --> 00:12:27,182
- You gotta blow on it!
- I did it pretty big. Oh.

122
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,194
- Oh, you got it. OK.
- Thank you so much!

123
00:12:29,225 --> 00:12:31,248
You all gotta go home
but you know the phrase.

124
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,177
You gotta get the hell up outta here!

125
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:36,107
Cos I'm not losing my virginity
or my liquor licence

126
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:38,035
over you bitches, so pack up!

127
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:40,089
- That's right!
- That's enough cocktails!

128
00:12:40,121 --> 00:12:42,123
Clear it out!
Hello, goodbye, Roger.

129
00:12:42,154 --> 00:12:44,062
Have fun!

130
00:12:44,093 --> 00:12:46,241
- Bring the drinks on out!
- Do you do that often?

131
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,088
- Do what?
- The show.

132
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:51,267
Yeah, yeah.
The girls are so nice to me here.

133
00:12:52,049 --> 00:12:55,219
I mean, they would never normally
let a girl sing at one of these shows

134
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,211
but they've always loved my voice.

135
00:12:57,242 --> 00:12:59,253
They used to beg me to sing.

136
00:12:59,286 --> 00:13:02,267
It's an honour, really.
I get to be one of the gay girls.

137
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:04,217
Is that your real eyebrow?

138
00:13:06,135 --> 00:13:08,169
Um... No. No.

139
00:13:09,117 --> 00:13:11,203
I... I make it out of tape.

140
00:13:12,173 --> 00:13:14,206
- Oh, so it's, like, stuck on?
- Mm-hm.

141
00:13:17,114 --> 00:13:18,283
Can I try to take it off?

142
00:13:19,251 --> 00:13:22,088
Uh... Yeah, sure.

143
00:13:23,141 --> 00:13:25,143
It's incredible what they do.

144
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,224
- Look at that.
- Yep. There it is.

145
00:13:33,255 --> 00:13:35,309
- I should put her down somewhere.
- OK.

146
00:13:38,239 --> 00:13:39,324
There we go.

147
00:13:40,313 --> 00:13:42,242
Why are you covering your eye?

148
00:13:42,273 --> 00:13:44,265
Just cos I don't have
my eyebrow on any more.

149
00:13:44,296 --> 00:13:47,237
Oh, no, no.
The whole point is I can see your face.

150
00:13:48,196 --> 00:13:50,156
Yeah, there we go.

151
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:58,111
Why did you come back here?

152
00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:01,260
Your friend brought me back here.
I'm glad he did.

153
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,304
Can I buy you a drink?

154
00:14:04,222 --> 00:14:08,163
Oh... I... I gotta change,
and I've got paint in my hair.

155
00:14:08,194 --> 00:14:10,269
- And my eyebrows are...
- That's not your real hair?

156
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,282
No, my hair's like your colour.

157
00:14:12,313 --> 00:14:15,180
- Oh, OK.
- But I paint it with this...

158
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,224
- ..makeup.
- I'd love to see what that looks like.

159
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,206
I'll wait for you.

160
00:14:23,146 --> 00:14:25,242
Um... Yeah, OK. Sure.

161
00:14:25,273 --> 00:14:28,234
Yeah, if you wanna wait,
I'll come have a drink with you.

162
00:14:28,265 --> 00:14:30,184
Sure.

163
00:14:30,215 --> 00:14:33,375
Bitch, can you get down off that stage
and come help me close this bar, please?

164
00:14:34,157 --> 00:14:36,263
Don't talk to me like that
in that bus driver wig, girl.

165
00:14:36,294 --> 00:14:40,162
Oh, I know you did not. What, you have
a street appointment tonight, sister?

166
00:14:40,193 --> 00:14:42,341
Excuse me! Mr Maine, would you mind?

167
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:45,240
Uh... What do you want me to do?

168
00:14:45,271 --> 00:14:47,242
Just come play a little song for me.

169
00:14:47,273 --> 00:14:49,337
- I don't know.
- Can you leave the man alone, please?

170
00:14:49,369 --> 00:14:52,215
I showed you mine, you show me yours.
Come on.

171
00:14:52,247 --> 00:14:56,209
He already signed your tits, honey.
Say, "No, sir."

172
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,327
- Show off for me a little bit.
- Only because you already performed.

173
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:01,213
You're so nice. Thank you.

174
00:15:01,244 --> 00:15:04,289
Lord, the man is here for Ally.
Not for you, sister.

175
00:15:05,373 --> 00:15:08,355
- Oh... She's nice. Yeah.
- Isn't it cute? Little arts and crafts.

176
00:15:08,387 --> 00:15:10,378
- Yeah, and light.
- Mm-hm.

177
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,173
- Did you do this yourself?
- Yeah, all me.

178
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,361
Looks great.

179
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:18,261
Does this mic work?
Oh, yeah. Fuck, all right.

180
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:19,419
What do you want me to play?

181
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,191
I don't care,
just look at me while you do it.

182
00:15:22,223 --> 00:15:26,216
- Oh, Lord! Somebody kill me now.
- Let me see what I can... All right.

183
00:16:48,336 --> 00:16:49,462
You're ready?

184
00:16:49,493 --> 00:16:52,309
- You know I would!
- OK.

185
00:16:52,944 --> 00:16:54,049
- It's a cop bar.
- Cops?

186
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:56,062
Yeah, that's why they serve
all night long.

187
00:17:02,902 --> 00:17:04,998
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- Oh. Sure.

188
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:07,083
Do you write songs or anything?

189
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:11,108
- I don't sing my own songs.
- Thank you.

190
00:17:12,973 --> 00:17:14,080
Why?

191
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:20,012
I just... I just don't feel comfortable.

192
00:17:20,043 --> 00:17:22,055
Why wouldn't you feel comfortable?

193
00:17:22,983 --> 00:17:23,984
Um...

194
00:17:24,016 --> 00:17:26,987
Well, cos, like,
almost every single person

195
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:29,125
that I've come in contact with
in the music industry

196
00:17:29,156 --> 00:17:32,149
has told me that my nose is too big
and that I won't make it.

197
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,932
- Your nose is too big?
- Yeah.

198
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:37,090
Your nose is beautiful.

199
00:17:37,997 --> 00:17:39,968
- Are you showing me your nose?
- Yeah.

200
00:17:39,999 --> 00:17:42,043
- I've been looking at it all night.
- Oh, come on.

201
00:17:42,074 --> 00:17:44,045
I'll be thinking about it
for a long time.

202
00:17:44,076 --> 00:17:46,120
- You're full of shit.
- I'm telling you the truth.

203
00:17:46,151 --> 00:17:48,143
- You're full of shit.
- Can I touch your nose?

204
00:17:48,174 --> 00:17:51,104
- Oh, my gosh!
- Let me just touch it for a second.

205
00:18:01,155 --> 00:18:03,167
- You're very lucky.
- Oh, really?

206
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:05,169
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah, not really.

207
00:18:05,201 --> 00:18:07,130
My nose has not made me lucky.

208
00:18:08,058 --> 00:18:11,082
I could've had maybe a hit song
if it wasn't for my nose.

209
00:18:11,113 --> 00:18:13,030
- That's fucking bullshit.
- Yeah.

210
00:18:13,063 --> 00:18:15,158
No, it's not bullshit
because you go into these rooms

211
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:17,159
and there's all these fucking men
in there

212
00:18:17,191 --> 00:18:20,204
and they're just staring at you,
listening to your record, going,

213
00:18:20,986 --> 00:18:24,041
"Oh, you sound great,
but you don't look so great."

214
00:18:24,073 --> 00:18:26,200
You know, I had a thing
when I was little...

215
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:29,161
I was born with this thing in my ear.
Couldn't hear.

216
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:32,997
What do I wind up being?
A singer. So, you never know.

217
00:18:33,175 --> 00:18:37,095
Look, talent comes everywhere.
Everybody's talented.

218
00:18:37,126 --> 00:18:39,180
Bet you fucking everybody
in this bar is talented

219
00:18:39,212 --> 00:18:43,018
in one thing or another,
but having something to say...

220
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:46,115
and the way to say it so people
listen to it, that's a whole other bag.

221
00:18:46,146 --> 00:18:49,201
And unless you get out there
and you try to do it, you'll never know.

222
00:18:49,232 --> 00:18:51,088
That's just the truth.

223
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,027
If there's one reason we're here,

224
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:55,228
it's to say something
so people wanna hear it.

225
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:59,022
- Understand what I'm trying to tell you?
- Yeah, I do.

226
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:02,036
I don't like it, but I understand it.

227
00:19:02,067 --> 00:19:04,017
Oh, I think you like it a little bit.

228
00:19:04,225 --> 00:19:07,135
I think I'm getting through a little bit.
I can see it.

229
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:09,209
No, you can't.

230
00:19:11,055 --> 00:19:12,265
It's a good thing we met.

231
00:19:14,057 --> 00:19:15,142
- Yeah.
- For both of us.

232
00:19:15,174 --> 00:19:17,164
- Trust me.
- I don't know what is going on.

233
00:19:17,196 --> 00:19:19,135
- Honestly, what...
- Who does?

234
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:22,211
I'm in a cop bar, with Jackson Maine.
It's, like...

235
00:19:22,242 --> 00:19:25,079
- Jackson Maine!
- I'm gonna wake up in a minute.

236
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:28,155
When you get famous,
people start saying your full name.

237
00:19:29,114 --> 00:19:31,116
- Well, what do you want...
- Just "Jack".

238
00:19:31,147 --> 00:19:33,076
Speaking of...

239
00:19:33,107 --> 00:19:34,119
Come on.

240
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,141
- What?
- Did you put that on?

241
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:41,052
You put that on.
When did you even go to the jukebox?

242
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,168
Oh, God!

243
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:45,098
I hear that song,
and I just wanna turn it the fuck off.

244
00:19:45,129 --> 00:19:47,068
- Jack Maine!
- I fucked that song up.

245
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,195
- No! What? Come on.
- Oh, my God!

246
00:19:49,227 --> 00:19:52,073
Hey, I know that
we're not supposed to do this.

247
00:19:52,209 --> 00:19:54,284
I know that we're not supposed
to bother you.

248
00:19:55,065 --> 00:19:56,087
That's all right.

249
00:19:56,118 --> 00:19:59,100
You got your camera?
I don't have mine. Excuse me, one sec.

250
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,175
- My ex-girlfriend was fucking this guy.
- OK.

251
00:20:01,206 --> 00:20:03,156
- Who looks like you, she said.
- Shut up.

252
00:20:03,188 --> 00:20:05,252
But I gotta take a picture of you
to send to her

253
00:20:05,283 --> 00:20:08,245
to show her that you look
nothing like that fucking guy.

254
00:20:08,276 --> 00:20:10,184
- Jack, I'm sorry.
- Take a picture.

255
00:20:10,215 --> 00:20:12,228
Will that help you?
Will that make you happy?

256
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:14,324
- OK. Take a picture?
- Want someone to take the picture?

257
00:20:15,105 --> 00:20:16,168
- No. It's OK.
- Excuse me.

258
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,306
- Get the fuck off, you little whore.
- What? What?

259
00:20:19,223 --> 00:20:21,236
- Hey, come on. Stand up, yeah.
- What?

260
00:20:23,154 --> 00:20:24,270
- I got you.
- I'm sorry, Jack!

261
00:20:24,301 --> 00:20:27,148
- It's all right.
- Oh, my God! Why did I...

262
00:20:30,245 --> 00:20:33,331
I'm fine, honestly. I'm OK.
This is so stupid.

263
00:20:34,112 --> 00:20:36,261
No, you gotta get ahead
of the swelling.

264
00:20:36,292 --> 00:20:38,200
Just trying to find some...

265
00:20:38,231 --> 00:20:40,254
- This is so embarrassing.
- ..peas.

266
00:20:41,317 --> 00:20:45,165
Here we go.
Yeah, put that on there.

267
00:20:45,196 --> 00:20:47,125
Gotta wrap something up with it.

268
00:20:47,157 --> 00:20:48,335
Find it.

269
00:20:49,304 --> 00:20:51,317
- You like Cheetos?
- No, like gauze.

270
00:20:51,348 --> 00:20:53,236
- Some gauze or something.
- Gauze?

271
00:20:53,267 --> 00:20:56,123
Try to do that. With that hand.

272
00:20:57,134 --> 00:20:58,323
And do that hand.

273
00:20:59,241 --> 00:21:00,367
You play piano?

274
00:21:02,202 --> 00:21:06,164
- Yeah, we gotta take care of this, then.
- Oh, OK. Thanks.

275
00:21:12,347 --> 00:21:15,172
And that's it, yeah.
Keep that on there. Hold on.

276
00:21:15,204 --> 00:21:17,311
Can you do that? Yeah.
Did you get it?

277
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:19,301
It's already gotten warm, hasn't it?

278
00:21:19,332 --> 00:21:21,334
- Should we have gotten two?
- No, it's OK.

279
00:21:22,367 --> 00:21:24,254
Thanks.

280
00:21:24,285 --> 00:21:27,195
I'm sorry. I... I had to.

281
00:21:27,226 --> 00:21:28,352
That's all right.

282
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,305
- It's not really all right, though.
- Have a good one.

283
00:21:33,336 --> 00:21:35,234
Be careful, she'll hit you.

284
00:21:37,361 --> 00:21:41,322
These rings are gonna get stuck
if you don't take them off.

285
00:21:42,396 --> 00:21:45,357
- Does that hurt?
- Yeah. That's OK.

286
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:47,234
- May I?
- Yeah.

287
00:21:54,398 --> 00:21:56,316
Safekeeping.

288
00:21:58,255 --> 00:22:00,226
- Put this on there.
- You're a sweetheart.

289
00:22:00,257 --> 00:22:01,425
And we'll just wrap it up.

290
00:22:02,207 --> 00:22:03,406
You'll be good to go.

291
00:22:04,188 --> 00:22:06,305
How the hell
do you deal with that all the time?

292
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:09,349
- What's that?
- People just...talking to you

293
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:12,269
like you're not a real person,
or taking your picture.

294
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,323
- Is that too tight?
- Ah, it's OK, thanks.

295
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,388
- Whoo... That hurt you?
- That's fine, it's OK.

296
00:22:18,347 --> 00:22:19,443
There we go.

297
00:22:20,224 --> 00:22:22,288
Now you're mobile.
Swing it around.

298
00:22:22,445 --> 00:22:26,365
- I look like a pirate.
- Right?

299
00:22:26,396 --> 00:22:28,398
I told you it was worth coming here.

300
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,338
How do you do that?

301
00:22:30,369 --> 00:22:32,423
- Do what?
- Don't change the subject.

302
00:22:32,455 --> 00:22:36,354
- Is that what I'm doing?
- Nobody ever asks you about you, huh?

303
00:22:36,386 --> 00:22:39,408
- Not sure.
- Where are you from?

304
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,265
Arizona.

305
00:22:43,308 --> 00:22:45,258
- Arizona boy.
- Mm-hm.

306
00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:48,240
Dad had, like, a midlife crisis, I think.

307
00:22:48,272 --> 00:22:50,284
So I've been told.

308
00:22:50,315 --> 00:22:55,362
Made his way to Arizona, started working
for this family on a pecan ranch.

309
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,416
- A pecan ranch?
- Yeah.

310
00:22:59,449 --> 00:23:03,484
Knocked up the family's daughter.
She was just shy of 18.

311
00:23:04,266 --> 00:23:06,330
Uh-oh.

312
00:23:06,362 --> 00:23:08,301
That's when I came into the picture.

313
00:23:08,332 --> 00:23:10,334
- OK. The son of an 18-year-old.
- Yeah.

314
00:23:10,366 --> 00:23:13,337
Well, she died at childbirth.

315
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,382
- Then, my dad...
- I'm sorry.

316
00:23:16,413 --> 00:23:18,320
He...

317
00:23:18,488 --> 00:23:21,355
He died when I was 13, so I guess...

318
00:23:21,386 --> 00:23:24,389
my brother would tell you
that he raised me, but...

319
00:23:25,452 --> 00:23:28,299
..I don't know.
I don't know who was raising who.

320
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:33,377
Just 127 acres of nuts, Navajo,
and nowhere to go.

321
00:24:09,453 --> 00:24:10,537
Is that me?

322
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:12,456
That's you.

323
00:24:13,509 --> 00:24:16,345
- Did you just write that now?
- Yeah.

324
00:24:17,357 --> 00:24:18,524
It's pretty good.

325
00:24:51,576 --> 00:24:56,519
I started writing this song
the other day, and...

326
00:25:01,564 --> 00:25:05,506
..maybe that could work,
like as a chorus or something.

327
00:25:07,456 --> 00:25:09,562
I have to think if I can remember it.
Ah...

328
00:25:45,638 --> 00:25:47,546
Holy shit.

329
00:25:50,538 --> 00:25:52,415
What is this?

330
00:25:53,562 --> 00:25:55,564
Was this supposed to help me?

331
00:26:04,531 --> 00:26:05,657
Can I tell you a secret?

332
00:26:10,516 --> 00:26:13,446
I think you might be a songwriter.

333
00:26:18,524 --> 00:26:20,661
But don't worry, I won't tell anybody.

334
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,552
But I'm not very good
at keeping secrets.

335
00:26:33,642 --> 00:26:35,654
You're a real gentleman.

336
00:26:37,552 --> 00:26:39,459
I think.

337
00:26:51,492 --> 00:26:52,629
Thank you, sir.
It's on the right.

338
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,516
- Right there?
- Which one?

339
00:26:54,547 --> 00:26:55,684
- This one.
- Oh, yeah.

340
00:26:56,466 --> 00:26:59,542
- What's all this?
- Oh, it's my dad.

341
00:26:59,573 --> 00:27:01,595
It's a long story.

342
00:27:01,627 --> 00:27:03,555
What's he, a sheikh?

343
00:27:05,495 --> 00:27:06,631
No, he's a driver.

344
00:27:07,601 --> 00:27:10,687
Hey, I got a gig.
You wanna come?

345
00:27:11,709 --> 00:27:14,483
- When?
- We're headed to the airport now.

346
00:27:14,514 --> 00:27:16,600
- Tonight.
- Tonight? No, I can't.

347
00:27:16,631 --> 00:27:19,644
I gotta go to work later.
I gotta go to bed.

348
00:27:19,675 --> 00:27:22,605
Who's gonna take care of your hand?
I messed it up.

349
00:27:22,636 --> 00:27:24,492
- Me.
- No, no!

350
00:27:24,523 --> 00:27:25,701
- I'll take care of it.
- It's my fault.

351
00:27:25,733 --> 00:27:28,642
- That's OK.
- No, listen. Hey!

352
00:27:30,581 --> 00:27:33,616
- You have my number.
- OK. All right.

353
00:27:38,568 --> 00:27:40,643
- Hey.
- What?

354
00:27:41,676 --> 00:27:44,532
I just wanted to take
another look at you.

355
00:28:06,699 --> 00:28:08,721
Maybe I fucked that up.

356
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,713
No.

357
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:13,779
- Hi, Dad.
- Pretty late, pretty late.

358
00:28:14,561 --> 00:28:15,666
- Oh? Is it late?
- Yeah.

359
00:28:15,697 --> 00:28:18,575
Look at you. You don't even know
where you're walking.

360
00:28:18,773 --> 00:28:20,702
- Come on.
- Well, I wanna go to bed.

361
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:24,747
No, come in for two minutes.
It's Wolfie's birthday. Come on.

362
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,667
- Two minutes!
- OK.

363
00:28:27,698 --> 00:28:29,596
- Wolfie!
- Yeah, sweetheart?

364
00:28:29,627 --> 00:28:31,796
- Who was the guy in the car?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

365
00:28:32,578 --> 00:28:33,693
- Hey, Ally.
- How's it goin'?

366
00:28:33,725 --> 00:28:35,800
- Happy birthday.
- "Happy birthday"?

367
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:37,687
- Yeah.
- It's not my birthday.

368
00:28:37,718 --> 00:28:39,804
- What do you mean? Come on.
- No, I was just saying...

369
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:42,754
What the hell happened in here?
My God!

370
00:28:42,786 --> 00:28:45,798
- This place is a mess!
- "Starting gate" is "shuppatsu geto",

371
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:49,688
- and "bad beat" is "warui bito".
- What's going on? Leave the butter out?

372
00:28:49,719 --> 00:28:52,732
Who the hell's betting on horses
at breakfast time in Japan?

373
00:28:52,763 --> 00:28:54,703
- It's not breakfast time.
- They're loading!

374
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:55,798
- Joe, come on!
- You're crazy!

375
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,779
Have a sizable investment on this.

376
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,802
What did I say
about smoking in this house?

377
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:01,752
- Outside!
- Who are you?

378
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:03,764
- It's my house.
- I know it's your house.

379
00:29:03,795 --> 00:29:06,620
- But you smoke too.
- All right, forget it.

380
00:29:06,651 --> 00:29:09,623
Sweetheart, you're happy here,
aren't you?

381
00:29:09,654 --> 00:29:10,676
I'm happy, Dad.

382
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:12,803
I'm just saying, she's got no space.

383
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:14,691
- What are you saying?
- Sweetheart.

384
00:29:14,722 --> 00:29:15,838
- She's got no space.
- Wait a minute.

385
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,726
I want my friends to look at you.

386
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,759
Take a good look.

387
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:24,637
With a voice like from heaven,
but you know what?

388
00:29:27,651 --> 00:29:29,684
It's not always the best singers
that make it.

389
00:29:30,622 --> 00:29:35,784
You know? I knew a couple of guys
could sing Sinatra under the table.

390
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:38,735
But Frank, he'd come on stage
with the blue eyes,

391
00:29:38,766 --> 00:29:42,644
the sharkskin suit,
the patent leather shoes...

392
00:29:42,675 --> 00:29:43,854
he becomes Frank Sinatra.

393
00:29:44,855 --> 00:29:48,775
And everybody else,
all these other guys...

394
00:29:48,806 --> 00:29:52,664
that really got it,
that really have it inside...

395
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:55,719
..just a bunch of nobodies.

396
00:29:56,762 --> 00:29:58,879
OK. Everybody, let's go.

397
00:29:59,661 --> 00:30:00,714
Time for work.

398
00:30:12,735 --> 00:30:14,810
Unfortunately,
you keep blasting the hearing...

399
00:30:14,841 --> 00:30:16,677
it's not gonna come back.

400
00:30:16,708 --> 00:30:18,856
I think it's time we reconsider
the in-ear monitors.

401
00:30:18,887 --> 00:30:21,859
We talked about that with Bobby
a couple of weeks ago.

402
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:24,705
If we put the in-ear molds in,
we can use those

403
00:30:24,736 --> 00:30:25,872
to amplify the high frequencies.

404
00:30:25,905 --> 00:30:27,781
- OK, great.
- Cut down the sound.

405
00:30:27,812 --> 00:30:29,699
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna talk to Bobby

406
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,732
- and get something set up.
- Sold. I'm sold.

407
00:30:31,764 --> 00:30:33,745
- All right, Jack.
- Yeah, call Bobby.

408
00:30:33,859 --> 00:30:36,883
- Stubborn son of a bitch.
<i>- Ready. One, two, three, four.</i>

409
00:30:55,933 --> 00:30:59,739
- We're trying...
- You gotta put 'em in, man.

410
00:31:03,721 --> 00:31:04,826
I told you, I can't wear those.

411
00:31:04,858 --> 00:31:07,850
When I wear 'em, it's just in my head,
and I need to be here.

412
00:31:07,881 --> 00:31:11,739
The doctor said it's the only way
to manage this thing, Jack.

413
00:31:11,916 --> 00:31:13,950
You're not gonna get back what you lost.

414
00:31:14,732 --> 00:31:16,796
It's the only way we can manage
what you still got.

415
00:31:16,828 --> 00:31:18,819
Oh, wow. Ha!

416
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:20,863
I think we're managing pretty good.

417
00:31:20,894 --> 00:31:22,875
What do you want me to do?

418
00:31:26,816 --> 00:31:30,788
- The door's wide open if you wanna go.
- You know what? Don't start that shit.

419
00:31:33,729 --> 00:31:35,898
Show a little fucking pride
in what you're doing, buddy.

420
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:39,745
I just wanna know
if she's on her way or not, that's all.

421
00:31:39,777 --> 00:31:41,768
Who's coming?

422
00:31:42,821 --> 00:31:43,926
What the fuck?

423
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:45,865
Who's here?

424
00:31:45,896 --> 00:31:48,753
I have no idea. He won't tell me.

425
00:31:50,828 --> 00:31:51,986
- Hi, Ally. I'm Phil.
- Hi.

426
00:31:52,768 --> 00:31:53,810
- We met last night.
- Yeah.

427
00:31:53,842 --> 00:31:56,876
- Jack sent me to take you to the gig.
- Oh, my God.

428
00:31:56,907 --> 00:31:58,993
Um... But I gotta work.

429
00:31:59,775 --> 00:32:01,881
- I can't go.
- He's really looking forward to this.

430
00:32:01,912 --> 00:32:03,767
I appreciate that, but...

431
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:06,812
I can't leave, so I'll be in my car
right down the street.

432
00:32:06,843 --> 00:32:09,763
Tell him, "Thank you, but no, thank you."
Say it like that.

433
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:12,870
- Wait, Ally. What are you doing?
- The fuck is that shit? This is crazy.

434
00:32:12,901 --> 00:32:14,914
- This is great.
- What the hell's going on?

435
00:32:14,945 --> 00:32:17,906
Look, a guy like that
invites you to a show...

436
00:32:17,938 --> 00:32:20,889
- It could be a great opportunity.
- Dad, don't start with me!

437
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,923
Listen. Does he know you sing at all?
Did he hear anything from you?

438
00:32:23,954 --> 00:32:26,852
- I gotta go to work.
- It's the opportunity of a lifetime.

439
00:32:26,883 --> 00:32:28,823
I don't have the same disease you have.

440
00:32:28,854 --> 00:32:31,836
You get around celebrities
like they're gonna rub off on you.

441
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:34,026
- What are you talking about?
- "Oh, you know who I drove?"

442
00:32:34,808 --> 00:32:36,831
Like magic, now you're famous.

443
00:32:36,862 --> 00:32:39,823
- And you're not. It's not magic, Dad.
- Sweetheart.

444
00:32:39,854 --> 00:32:41,919
He's a drunk!
You know all about drunks.

445
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,908
Sweetheart, he's still there.

446
00:32:54,033 --> 00:32:55,076
You fucking hit a cop?

447
00:32:55,107 --> 00:32:59,153
Yeah, he was being an asshole to Jack,
so I fucking popped him in the face.

448
00:32:59,184 --> 00:33:00,999
That is so gangster!

449
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:04,064
Then we ended up in a parking lot
and he put peas around my hand to fix it.

450
00:33:04,096 --> 00:33:07,088
Then he was singing and I was singing.
I don't know what's going on.

451
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:09,111
Now he's got his driver
following me around.

452
00:33:09,142 --> 00:33:11,174
He's been following you
from your house to work?

453
00:33:11,207 --> 00:33:13,135
- Yes. It's crazy!
- You're fucking late.

454
00:33:13,166 --> 00:33:14,991
I'm what?

455
00:33:15,022 --> 00:33:16,169
I said you're late!

456
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:27,045
Are we doing this?

457
00:33:32,153 --> 00:33:34,030
Hey, Bryan, I'm out.

458
00:33:34,061 --> 00:33:36,073
- Find somebody else.
- Bryan, I'll be back.

459
00:33:36,105 --> 00:33:38,044
- Papo, I promise.
- See ya. I won't.

460
00:33:40,182 --> 00:33:44,019
- Did you see Bryan's face?
- Hey, great! Let's do this.

461
00:33:44,196 --> 00:33:46,052
Let's go.

462
00:33:47,022 --> 00:33:48,231
What are we doing?

463
00:33:49,149 --> 00:33:53,069
You know, if I didn't know Jack...
I would call you a stalker.

464
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:56,186
Yeah, sorry about that.

465
00:33:58,094 --> 00:34:00,201
Yes, man!

466
00:34:04,194 --> 00:34:07,166
Lay on that couch right now!
I'm gonna take my shoes off.

467
00:34:07,197 --> 00:34:08,282
- Oh, my God!
- This is nice.

468
00:34:09,063 --> 00:34:10,190
How this shit works?

469
00:34:10,221 --> 00:34:12,243
- They just told you no.
- Oh, OK. I'm so sorry.

470
00:34:12,275 --> 00:34:14,109
Oh, shit!

471
00:34:17,185 --> 00:34:18,291
I could get used to this shit.

472
00:34:19,073 --> 00:34:21,200
You need to date more rock stars,
baby girl, you know?

473
00:34:21,231 --> 00:34:22,295
We're not dating.

474
00:34:33,221 --> 00:34:34,264
Hi, Ally. I'm Gail.

475
00:34:35,192 --> 00:34:36,235
<i>- Hi.</i>
<i>- Hi.</i>

476
00:34:36,266 --> 00:34:38,216
Leave your bags.
We'll grab 'em in a sec.

477
00:34:38,247 --> 00:34:39,300
- Ready?
- OK, sure.

478
00:34:40,082 --> 00:34:41,229
- OK. Yeah.
- Thanks.

479
00:34:46,182 --> 00:34:48,299
- Did you have a good trip?
- Yeah.

480
00:34:51,217 --> 00:34:52,260
Passes.

481
00:34:52,292 --> 00:34:54,231
- Thank you.
- Put 'em around your necks.

482
00:34:54,262 --> 00:34:57,098
Ear plugs. You'll need these.
It's loud up there.

483
00:34:58,276 --> 00:35:00,133
Yeah, I got 'em.
We're coming in.

484
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:02,124
I'll bring you guys to the side stage.

485
00:35:06,264 --> 00:35:08,214
Guys, guys, guys. This way.
Wrong way.

486
00:35:08,245 --> 00:35:12,144
- Sorry. This place is so big. I'm just...
- Come on, this way.

487
00:35:12,311 --> 00:35:14,219
Oh, watch yourself.

488
00:35:16,116 --> 00:35:17,180
You guys good?

489
00:35:18,348 --> 00:35:20,297
Hey, boys.

490
00:35:21,257 --> 00:35:23,238
He's so excited that you're here.

491
00:37:26,449 --> 00:37:28,430
Thank you very much.

492
00:37:29,337 --> 00:37:31,244
That was great.

493
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:35,446
There's a friend of mine
who came a long way to be here

494
00:37:35,478 --> 00:37:38,324
and she wrote a great song,
and I'd like her to sing it.

495
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:40,305
I think it's pretty fucking good.

496
00:37:47,385 --> 00:37:49,252
- How are you?
- I'm good. Hi!

497
00:37:49,283 --> 00:37:50,440
- It's so good to see you.
- How are you?

498
00:37:50,472 --> 00:37:52,390
- You were so good.
- The trip was fine?

499
00:37:52,422 --> 00:37:54,339
- Yeah.
- Phil didn't bother you?

500
00:37:54,371 --> 00:37:55,476
Gail was so nice.

501
00:37:56,258 --> 00:37:58,375
So, listen, we're gonna
sing that song, all right?

502
00:37:58,406 --> 00:38:00,397
I did an arrangement -
kind of not so great -

503
00:38:00,429 --> 00:38:02,285
- but stick with it.
- No, I can't.

504
00:38:02,316 --> 00:38:03,463
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, you're coming.

505
00:38:03,494 --> 00:38:06,435
Please. It's not funny.
Jack, don't fuck around.

506
00:38:07,467 --> 00:38:09,500
All you gotta do is trust me.

507
00:38:10,376 --> 00:38:12,304
That's all you gotta do.

508
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:16,423
I'm gonna sing it either way, so...

509
00:38:27,507 --> 00:38:31,344
- Steve...
- "Trust me." OK.

510
00:38:32,323 --> 00:38:34,388
- You have to go sing.
- I'm not going out there, no.

511
00:42:04,577 --> 00:42:07,528
- Oh, my God! There's so many people.
- Pretty fucking good, man.

512
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:08,602
Pretty fucking good.

513
00:42:08,633 --> 00:42:10,531
The way the guitar started...

514
00:42:10,562 --> 00:42:13,545
I thought maybe I set it in the wrong key,
and the tempo was too fast.

515
00:42:13,576 --> 00:42:15,713
- No, it was so beautiful, and...
- I wasn't sure...

516
00:42:15,745 --> 00:42:17,631
- Ally, you OK?
- Jack?

517
00:42:19,602 --> 00:42:20,749
Jack?

518
00:42:22,511 --> 00:42:23,720
You. You, move!

519
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:28,538
- Isn't that the girl who sang?
- Good concert, man!

520
00:42:28,569 --> 00:42:29,737
- Thank you, yeah.
- Love you, man.

521
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:33,564
- Thank you.
- Hey, Jack. Killed it.

522
00:42:33,595 --> 00:42:34,742
- Really?
- Yeah.

523
00:42:42,738 --> 00:42:45,627
Hi! Oh, my God!

524
00:42:45,658 --> 00:42:47,670
Where's my key?
I don't fucking...

525
00:42:48,744 --> 00:42:50,705
Ah! Ha-ha-ha.

526
00:42:52,634 --> 00:42:53,781
Oh, fuck!

527
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,612
I'll be right back. OK?
Just give me one second.

528
00:43:17,625 --> 00:43:20,587
Is this the bathroom?
Where's the fucking...

529
00:43:20,618 --> 00:43:21,702
OK.

530
00:43:50,605 --> 00:43:51,731
Hey.

531
00:43:53,629 --> 00:43:54,661
Jack?

532
00:43:54,693 --> 00:43:56,621
I don't know, wake him up.

533
00:43:56,652 --> 00:43:58,696
- I can't wake him up. He's drunk.
- Yes, you can!

534
00:43:58,727 --> 00:44:01,772
Shake your titties in his face
or some shit, and just fucking...

535
00:44:01,803 --> 00:44:03,711
Know what I'm saying?
Take two shots.

536
00:44:03,742 --> 00:44:05,838
Thank you so much for your help.
You are so helpful.

537
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:07,778
Let me know how it goes, baby.

538
00:44:15,859 --> 00:44:17,819
Come on, pal.

539
00:44:25,722 --> 00:44:26,848
He's out.

540
00:44:29,747 --> 00:44:32,656
You think maybe he drinks
a bit much?

541
00:44:35,878 --> 00:44:38,661
Sweetie, you have no idea.

542
00:44:39,756 --> 00:44:41,664
Tell you one thing, though.

543
00:44:41,695 --> 00:44:43,864
He's never brought a girl
on stage before.

544
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:49,807
And it's been a long, long time
since he played like that.

545
00:44:50,725 --> 00:44:52,706
Well, that's good to know.

546
00:45:56,757 --> 00:45:57,956
One time, my brother came home,

547
00:45:58,737 --> 00:46:01,719
I was playing on this upright
we used to always have in our den.

548
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:02,866
And I was, like, in my own world.

549
00:46:02,897 --> 00:46:04,920
No-one was ever home,
and then he comes home

550
00:46:04,951 --> 00:46:06,859
to take care of my dad,
who was sick.

551
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:09,946
And he's sittin' there,
and he's looking at me.

552
00:46:10,728 --> 00:46:13,887
I swear to God, he looked at me
like I was special or something,

553
00:46:13,918 --> 00:46:15,931
and it just kind of filled me up.

554
00:46:15,962 --> 00:46:18,745
I should've never told you that.
I don't know.

555
00:46:18,777 --> 00:46:19,830
Why?

556
00:46:19,862 --> 00:46:21,936
- Cos it's embarrassing.
- It's so sweet.

557
00:46:21,968 --> 00:46:24,803
Cos you're nothing like my brother,
let me just say.

558
00:46:24,835 --> 00:46:28,745
- Yeah, I don't look like your brother?
- He's a fucking old man, OK.

559
00:46:28,943 --> 00:46:30,976
My dad had me
when he was 63 years old.

560
00:46:31,758 --> 00:46:32,832
63 years old?

561
00:46:32,864 --> 00:46:35,835
- And we have different mothers, so...
- Huh.

562
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,776
What's that number down here?

563
00:46:40,777 --> 00:46:42,831
That is how many people looked at it.

564
00:46:42,862 --> 00:46:45,876
Get the fuck out of here. How do
they know how many people looked at it?

565
00:46:45,907 --> 00:46:48,764
I think it's...
They call it an algorithm, or...

566
00:46:48,795 --> 00:46:49,890
What's an algorithm?

567
00:46:49,921 --> 00:46:51,777
It's like a beat.

568
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,915
- A beat?
- Yeah. Yeah.

569
00:46:53,946 --> 00:46:55,833
- Like in music, a beat?
- Yeah.

570
00:46:55,865 --> 00:46:58,804
Yeah, yeah. I think, I don't know.

571
00:46:58,993 --> 00:47:01,005
- Do you believe this?
- No.

572
00:47:03,934 --> 00:47:05,853
- Wow.
- And you see this?

573
00:47:05,884 --> 00:47:07,824
- Yeah.
- That's how many people have watched.

574
00:47:07,855 --> 00:47:09,878
- Yeah, we're just telling...
- They was telling him.

575
00:47:09,909 --> 00:47:12,881
- How the fuck do they do that?
- I've watched it 200 times myself.

576
00:47:12,912 --> 00:47:15,894
- I'm 200 of those people.
- Go, Pops.

577
00:47:17,907 --> 00:47:22,806
Oh, jeez!
My God, you're so fast! Jack!

578
00:47:22,838 --> 00:47:24,881
French toast is gonna come out.

579
00:47:28,927 --> 00:47:30,877
First one to hit the bed.

580
00:47:41,845 --> 00:47:46,058
- Beautiful. You wrote this with him?
- He's so talented.

581
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,956
- Can I watch it again?
- Yeah, it's good. One more time.

582
00:47:48,988 --> 00:47:51,886
- I'll be up all night watching this.
- Or 500. Come on!

583
00:47:52,981 --> 00:47:54,983
Christ!

584
00:48:13,907 --> 00:48:15,951
Oh, my God.

585
00:48:16,879 --> 00:48:18,047
How did you get in here?

586
00:48:18,078 --> 00:48:19,997
Your dad let me in.

587
00:48:34,051 --> 00:48:35,866
What?

588
00:48:41,954 --> 00:48:43,998
<i>I don't feel this way about everybody.</i>

589
00:48:44,029 --> 00:48:48,106
Well, good. Then we're on the same page.
You come and sing with me.

590
00:48:49,952 --> 00:48:51,891
Where?

591
00:48:51,923 --> 00:48:54,060
Well, first stop's Arizona.

592
00:49:00,076 --> 00:49:03,058
I'm never getting on that thing with you
when you've been drinking.

593
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:06,134
I haven't even thought about drinking
or anything else.

594
00:49:06,916 --> 00:49:09,126
We'll see how long that lasts.
Go wait downstairs.

595
00:49:11,983 --> 00:49:15,977
Actually, when I was in my 20's and 30's,
I was like a crooner.

596
00:49:16,008 --> 00:49:18,928
As a matter of fact,
a lot of people thought I was...

597
00:49:18,959 --> 00:49:20,918
better than Sinatra.

598
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:23,066
Frank Sinatra?

599
00:49:33,045 --> 00:49:34,964
What are you writing down in here?

600
00:49:34,995 --> 00:49:37,977
That's my songbook.
I usually use a typewriter, but...

601
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:40,114
I had this idea on the bike...

602
00:49:40,146 --> 00:49:42,096
and I didn't wanna forget it.

603
00:49:43,033 --> 00:49:46,036
How do you hear it?

604
00:49:57,944 --> 00:50:01,968
Aren't you excited to be home
and play for all your Arizonian fans?

605
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,178
I don't really come back here.

606
00:50:04,105 --> 00:50:06,983
- You avoid your home?
- I don't know.

607
00:50:08,068 --> 00:50:10,007
It's like the hot air and...

608
00:50:14,021 --> 00:50:16,013
..the history, I don't know.

609
00:50:16,962 --> 00:50:20,121
Bought the ranch, though, I grew up on.
Gave it to my brother.

610
00:50:21,966 --> 00:50:24,990
We buried Dad there, and so I wanted
to make sure that nobody...

611
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:27,023
paved over his grave or...

612
00:50:27,054 --> 00:50:29,067
- any of that kind of shit.
- Is it around here?

613
00:50:29,098 --> 00:50:30,975
It's not far.

614
00:50:31,006 --> 00:50:33,071
Why don't we just go there?
It's nearby.

615
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:35,187
Mm. Mm.

616
00:50:36,084 --> 00:50:37,189
Mm.

617
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,188
Jack?

618
00:50:56,051 --> 00:50:57,125
Yeah, if he shows up!

619
00:50:57,156 --> 00:51:00,149
These guys have been vamping out there
for a fucking half an hour.

620
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:02,151
It's time to fucking get on.

621
00:51:02,182 --> 00:51:04,141
Don't you get tired of being...

622
00:51:06,102 --> 00:51:08,041
You sold Dad's ranch!

623
00:51:08,229 --> 00:51:11,253
They turned it into a fucking wind farm!

624
00:51:15,225 --> 00:51:17,196
I bought that for you.

625
00:51:21,054 --> 00:51:22,201
Where's his grave?

626
00:51:22,232 --> 00:51:25,141
He washed away in a fucking storm.

627
00:51:25,172 --> 00:51:27,226
His grave isn't there any more.

628
00:51:29,092 --> 00:51:31,251
I told you, but you were fucking drunk.

629
00:51:32,033 --> 00:51:33,263
You were fucking loaded...

630
00:51:34,045 --> 00:51:36,245
and already pissing yourself
a swan song.

631
00:51:39,155 --> 00:51:41,146
Fuck if you shed a tear
for that piece of shit

632
00:51:41,177 --> 00:51:44,159
you idolise for
no goddamn fucking reason.

633
00:51:47,266 --> 00:51:50,112
All Dad ever did for you...

634
00:51:52,062 --> 00:51:54,169
..was make you
his fucking drinking buddy.

635
00:51:55,149 --> 00:51:59,111
And you'd be right there with him if he
was still alive and you fucking know it.

636
00:52:02,124 --> 00:52:03,271
What did you think...

637
00:52:03,303 --> 00:52:06,159
that I was gonna
fucking take care of it...

638
00:52:07,076 --> 00:52:11,112
..while I'm fucking cradling your ass
all over the goddamn world?

639
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:18,223
Yeah.

640
00:52:20,256 --> 00:52:23,123
That's a good excuse.
Raising a little brother

641
00:52:23,155 --> 00:52:26,178
so you don't have to deal with the fact
that you were no fucking good.

642
00:52:27,179 --> 00:52:30,130
If I was no good,
why'd you steal my fucking voice?

643
00:52:32,184 --> 00:52:35,176
- Huh?
- Cos you had nothing to fucking say.

644
00:52:40,181 --> 00:52:43,216
You were too proud to sing
any of the songs I ever wrote.

645
00:52:46,249 --> 00:52:48,261
Well, I got something to say now, pal.

646
00:52:48,292 --> 00:52:51,191
I'm done being your fucking errand boy.

647
00:52:53,329 --> 00:52:55,185
I quit.

648
00:53:01,639 --> 00:53:04,642
Yeah, my voice just got up on me
a few months ago and...

649
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:07,812
..another shot of steroids
is better safe than sorry.

650
00:53:08,594 --> 00:53:11,774
Thank you for that. We should be good.

651
00:53:27,727 --> 00:53:28,811
Hey.

652
00:53:30,792 --> 00:53:33,649
- You OK?
- Yeah.

653
00:53:35,609 --> 00:53:37,663
Well, let's play.

654
00:55:48,861 --> 00:55:50,800
All right, I got an idea for the end.

655
00:55:50,832 --> 00:55:51,843
- Sorry...
- That's OK.

656
00:55:51,874 --> 00:55:54,867
- It's gonna be a little different...
- Cheers. Where's that joint?

657
00:55:54,898 --> 00:55:57,879
We're gonna be a little different
for the end, OK?

658
00:55:57,911 --> 00:56:00,778
- Do the encore and the thing that I said.
- OK.

659
00:56:00,809 --> 00:56:02,853
All right?
Come on, let's go back out and do it.

660
00:56:02,884 --> 00:56:05,804
- What are you doing?
- Go, go, go.

661
00:56:07,816 --> 00:56:09,912
All right, listen to me.
Here's what we're gonna do.

662
00:56:09,943 --> 00:56:12,780
You're gonna do the song
that I said I wanted you to do.

663
00:56:12,811 --> 00:56:13,927
- The one that I love.
- No. I'm not.

664
00:56:13,958 --> 00:56:15,991
- Please!
- Do the one that I love. It'll be great.

665
00:56:16,772 --> 00:56:17,951
- Jack, please...
- I said I always...

666
00:56:17,983 --> 00:56:20,870
- You promised to do it. I love you.
- I always say...

667
00:56:22,851 --> 00:56:24,885
Always remember us this way.

668
00:56:29,962 --> 00:56:33,810
Everybody, we're gonna
bring out Ally to bring us home...

669
00:56:33,841 --> 00:56:35,948
and she's gonna sing an original song.

670
00:56:36,959 --> 00:56:38,804
Thank you.

671
01:00:05,041 --> 01:00:09,108
Ally! Ally! Ally! Ally!

672
01:00:16,991 --> 01:00:19,222
That was fucking beautiful.

673
01:00:20,192 --> 01:00:23,100
No, you were fucking doing it.
I was there, I fucking...

674
01:00:23,131 --> 01:00:26,009
- Our car's over there.
- Ally, that was unbelievable.

675
01:00:26,041 --> 01:00:28,136
- Thank you.
- That was unbelievable what you did.

676
01:00:28,168 --> 01:00:29,200
Thank you.

677
01:00:29,231 --> 01:00:32,203
I don't know if you know about me,
about where I've come from.

678
01:00:32,234 --> 01:00:34,247
I'm Rez Gavron.

679
01:00:35,029 --> 01:00:37,208
I know who you are.

680
01:00:37,239 --> 01:00:42,087
What you have right now
goes way beyond just this.

681
01:00:44,037 --> 01:00:47,196
There's people who need to hear
what you have to say musically.

682
01:00:48,114 --> 01:00:52,045
This is not normal stuff.
It's really amazing what you're doing.

683
01:00:52,076 --> 01:00:54,224
I think you have it all. I do.

684
01:00:54,255 --> 01:00:57,112
And the question to you is,
"What do you want?"

685
01:00:58,186 --> 01:01:01,189
I'm in that position,
to put you wherever you want to be.

686
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:04,254
I... I don't... I don't have...

687
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:09,280
I gotta talk to Jack.

688
01:01:10,062 --> 01:01:13,263
He said that he thought Interscope
Records might really wanna sign me.

689
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:16,234
And he said that he has
this wonderful studio

690
01:01:16,266 --> 01:01:18,153
with a beautiful live room

691
01:01:18,184 --> 01:01:20,270
and these amazing producers
he wants to bring in

692
01:01:21,051 --> 01:01:22,261
to record my songs.

693
01:01:23,188 --> 01:01:25,138
And he loves Look What I've Found.

694
01:01:25,170 --> 01:01:27,203
Remember the song we did in the diner?

695
01:01:27,234 --> 01:01:29,299
- Remember, when we were driving?
- Yeah.

696
01:01:31,082 --> 01:01:32,166
Yeah?

697
01:01:32,197 --> 01:01:37,098
I mean, it was so nice talking to him,
and he really believes in me.

698
01:01:38,255 --> 01:01:40,257
- You all right, Jack?
- He's OK. He's fine.

699
01:01:40,289 --> 01:01:42,165
He does this all the time.

700
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:45,168
Hey, Jack.

701
01:01:50,246 --> 01:01:52,206
Thanks.

702
01:01:53,207 --> 01:01:56,210
What's going on? Hm?

703
01:01:58,202 --> 01:02:00,088
What are you doing?

704
01:02:04,269 --> 01:02:05,301
Oh.

705
01:02:10,171 --> 01:02:12,246
You jealous fuck.

706
01:02:15,113 --> 01:02:16,271
I'm so happy for you.

707
01:02:16,302 --> 01:02:18,293
Oh, you are?

708
01:02:18,325 --> 01:02:21,170
Oh... Jackson!

709
01:02:22,244 --> 01:02:24,330
Oh, my God!

710
01:02:26,238 --> 01:02:28,292
Jack. Stop!

711
01:02:31,118 --> 01:02:33,172
Why are you so jealous, boy?

712
01:02:33,203 --> 01:02:34,329
Hm?

713
01:02:36,144 --> 01:02:37,332
What are you doing?

714
01:02:37,364 --> 01:02:40,147
What's wrong? You upset?

715
01:02:42,264 --> 01:02:44,182
You want me to make you less...

716
01:02:45,131 --> 01:02:47,279
I know, do you wanna play?
OK, let's play.

717
01:02:50,323 --> 01:02:52,357
What the hell is this?

718
01:02:53,139 --> 01:02:54,286
- I'm so sorry.
<i>- No, you're fine.</i>

719
01:02:54,317 --> 01:02:57,185
<i>- You sound great, OK?</i>
<i>- You're doing great.</i>

720
01:02:57,216 --> 01:02:59,187
<i>We'll do it again.</i>
<i>I'm gonna cue you in.</i>

721
01:03:04,264 --> 01:03:07,183
<i>One second. Listen to my cue.</i>
<i>We'll come right in, OK?</i>

722
01:03:07,214 --> 01:03:09,321
<i>So, should... Well...</i>

723
01:03:10,207 --> 01:03:12,313
<i>I'm sorry,</i>
<i>but will I sing in the beginning?</i>

724
01:03:12,344 --> 01:03:16,203
You're gonna hear the second line,
and then I wanna start recording.

725
01:03:16,234 --> 01:03:19,195
I think I got an idea
that might help out, all right?

726
01:03:19,226 --> 01:03:22,187
- Please. Be my guest.
- That was really good up to that point.

727
01:03:22,218 --> 01:03:24,398
- I'm gonna go in there for a second.
- All right, Jack.

728
01:03:26,253 --> 01:03:29,256
- I've never sang with a track before.
- I think you need your piano.

729
01:03:29,288 --> 01:03:32,416
- If you're playing it and singing it...
- Yeah, I always play it on the piano.

730
01:03:33,198 --> 01:03:35,304
I'm gonna have them fly one in,
and we'll try it there

731
01:03:35,335 --> 01:03:37,358
- and see where it goes.
- You think that's OK?

732
01:03:38,349 --> 01:03:40,403
- OK. Thank you.
- I got you. You're doing great.

733
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:42,321
- You OK?
- No, I'm so nervous.

734
01:03:42,353 --> 01:03:44,396
- You look so beautiful.
- Thank you.

735
01:03:45,417 --> 01:03:47,221
Thank you.

736
01:04:29,334 --> 01:04:32,275
Oh, so you guys have already met
the new girl, have you?

737
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:35,330
- Rez! What's the plan?
- What's up?

738
01:04:35,361 --> 01:04:37,373
Thanks for doing this, man.
I appreciate it.

739
01:04:37,405 --> 01:04:40,366
This is pop music, kids.
We have a battle to do, OK?

740
01:04:40,397 --> 01:04:42,420
You are the troops,
so if I call you "troops",

741
01:04:42,451 --> 01:04:44,443
just know that we're going into battle.

742
01:04:44,474 --> 01:04:46,267
What is my lyrics, Ally?

743
01:04:55,495 --> 01:04:59,290
This is just fine-tuning
and creating an image.

744
01:04:59,321 --> 01:05:03,430
I know. I just don't wanna lose
the part of me that's...talented.

745
01:05:03,461 --> 01:05:07,287
I'm not gonna let you lose that piece.
I'm not gonna let you lose that piece.

746
01:05:07,318 --> 01:05:08,361
OK.

747
01:05:12,406 --> 01:05:15,357
What are we gonna do with you?

748
01:05:15,389 --> 01:05:17,432
What are we gonna do with...
Oh, he's beautiful!

749
01:05:17,463 --> 01:05:21,332
- "You can't send me back. I'm too cute."
- Hey, he's got your eyelashes.

750
01:05:21,363 --> 01:05:24,282
He does. He's got your eyelashes.
Hey, bud!

751
01:05:25,408 --> 01:05:28,328
This has never been done before,
just so you know.

752
01:05:28,359 --> 01:05:30,413
It actually has been done before.

753
01:05:31,393 --> 01:05:33,385
Would you please...

754
01:05:33,416 --> 01:05:35,376
Please. Do it for me.

755
01:05:36,346 --> 01:05:38,431
No, I can't in the water.

756
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:05,415
Mm.

757
01:06:06,531 --> 01:06:08,501
You comin' with me to Memphis?

758
01:06:11,421 --> 01:06:13,537
- What are you talkin' about?
- I gotta go do this...

759
01:06:14,517 --> 01:06:17,333
You know, it's one of those paid things.

760
01:06:18,344 --> 01:06:20,544
Soul-crushing work, really,
but it's kind of never

761
01:06:20,576 --> 01:06:23,547
what I thought I'd wind up doing, maybe.
I don't know, but...

762
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:28,353
I've made peace with it, though.

763
01:06:28,530 --> 01:06:34,401
Anyway, if you wanna come, I thought...
we could have a laugh, at the very least.

764
01:06:34,432 --> 01:06:38,415
Rez wants to keep me here because,
you know, they rushed out the single

765
01:06:38,447 --> 01:06:41,471
and they were so excited
that they want me to finish the album.

766
01:06:41,502 --> 01:06:44,567
- So I'm working on that.
- Listen to what you're saying.

767
01:06:44,599 --> 01:06:47,392
Listen to what you just said.

768
01:06:48,424 --> 01:06:50,593
People wanna hear what you have to say.
That's the stuff.

769
01:06:51,375 --> 01:06:52,606
- I... I can't...
- Hey, hey.

770
01:06:53,554 --> 01:06:55,515
Take it in.

771
01:06:56,443 --> 01:06:58,393
Thank you, by the way.

772
01:06:58,424 --> 01:07:00,530
- Thank you for what?
- Giving me a home.

773
01:07:01,448 --> 01:07:03,471
This place never felt like one before.

774
01:07:40,433 --> 01:07:42,549
Oh, fuck.

775
01:07:43,467 --> 01:07:45,437
Jack, you OK?

776
01:07:46,469 --> 01:07:47,585
Jack?

777
01:08:22,567 --> 01:08:24,610
Is there a reason
why you're not up there?

778
01:08:53,721 --> 01:08:56,661
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

779
01:08:57,516 --> 01:08:58,663
Oh, my... Oh, my... Hey!

780
01:08:58,694 --> 01:09:00,686
- Pretty incredible.
- Did Jack show up?

781
01:09:00,717 --> 01:09:02,709
- I haven't heard from him.
- What do you mean?

782
01:09:03,491 --> 01:09:05,523
- I haven't heard from him.
- I can't find him.

783
01:09:05,555 --> 01:09:06,661
I called him three times.

784
01:09:06,692 --> 01:09:08,651
What happened
with the dancers there?

785
01:09:08,682 --> 01:09:12,572
I just thought that I should do it alone
cos it's so overwhelming.

786
01:09:12,603 --> 01:09:14,532
OK, but you can't go rogue on me.

787
01:09:14,563 --> 01:09:16,722
You have to understand
that this is what I do

788
01:09:17,504 --> 01:09:18,651
and you have to trust me, OK?

789
01:09:18,682 --> 01:09:20,590
So, if I give you a couple of dancers,

790
01:09:20,622 --> 01:09:24,521
don't not use them
and then miss a couple of steps, OK?

791
01:09:25,710 --> 01:09:29,525
We also have to change your hair.
We have to change the colour of your hair.

792
01:09:29,557 --> 01:09:30,662
What's wrong with my hair?

793
01:09:30,693 --> 01:09:34,520
- I'm thinking platinum, or...
- I don't wanna be fucking blonde.

794
01:09:34,551 --> 01:09:37,627
I am who I am,
and I'm worried about Jack.

795
01:09:37,742 --> 01:09:39,723
I will find Jack, OK?

796
01:09:40,651 --> 01:09:41,725
I will find him.

797
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:48,763
Jack.

798
01:09:50,545 --> 01:09:52,579
I feel like we've done this before.

799
01:09:54,654 --> 01:09:57,709
Didn't think we'd do it so soon, man.
Come on, bro. Get up.

800
01:10:00,545 --> 01:10:02,641
All right. There we go.

801
01:10:04,622 --> 01:10:06,770
In my mind, I made it to the door.

802
01:10:07,551 --> 01:10:09,720
I almost didn't wake you.
You looked so comfortable.

803
01:10:11,617 --> 01:10:14,787
- How you doin'?
- I've seen better days, I guess.

804
01:10:16,664 --> 01:10:18,677
I apologise for...

805
01:10:18,708 --> 01:10:20,783
- disrespecting your property...
- Not necessary.

806
01:10:21,565 --> 01:10:24,630
- ..or whatever I did.
- You want some coffee?

807
01:10:24,662 --> 01:10:26,632
Put some on,
and we'll come in in a minute.

808
01:10:26,664 --> 01:10:27,769
OK.

809
01:10:29,697 --> 01:10:31,761
That's him, right? That's your boy.

810
01:10:31,793 --> 01:10:34,764
Jack, he's as old now...

811
01:10:35,745 --> 01:10:38,591
..as you were when I met you.

812
01:10:39,707 --> 01:10:41,605
Saw you on YouTube.

813
01:10:41,636 --> 01:10:44,639
- That video with the girl.
- Yeah.

814
01:10:45,807 --> 01:10:48,820
It made me happy, man.
You looked like you.

815
01:10:49,601 --> 01:10:51,666
You were just...

816
01:10:51,697 --> 01:10:53,668
just doing it, bro.

817
01:10:54,690 --> 01:10:56,598
She writes too.

818
01:10:57,599 --> 01:10:59,622
- She wrote that tune?
- Yeah.

819
01:10:59,653 --> 01:11:01,613
Bunch of others too.

820
01:11:02,771 --> 01:11:06,712
Got hooked up with some manager guy,
wants to...

821
01:11:11,633 --> 01:11:12,842
You know.

822
01:11:13,624 --> 01:11:15,772
- She's good, bro.
- I know.

823
01:11:17,670 --> 01:11:19,693
Maybe she's a way out.

824
01:11:22,831 --> 01:11:25,657
Ain't nothing to be afraid of, bro.

825
01:11:26,731 --> 01:11:28,628
You know, it's like...

826
01:11:32,757 --> 01:11:36,646
I don't know... You... You float out...

827
01:11:37,824 --> 01:11:41,776
..float out at sea,
and then...one day, you find a port,

828
01:11:42,694 --> 01:11:44,811
say, "I'm gonna stay here
for a few days."

829
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:47,646
A few days becomes a few years.

830
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:51,650
And then you forgot where you were goin'
in the first place.

831
01:11:52,776 --> 01:11:56,655
And then you realise you don't really
give a shit about where you was going,

832
01:11:56,686 --> 01:11:57,875
cos you like where you're at.

833
01:11:59,752 --> 01:12:00,878
That's how it is for me.

834
01:12:01,837 --> 01:12:03,714
I like where I'm at.

835
01:12:04,850 --> 01:12:07,665
I didn't even realise
I liked it so much...

836
01:12:07,833 --> 01:12:10,803
..till I saw your ass
sleeping in the grass this morning.

837
01:12:14,859 --> 01:12:18,759
Yeah, come on, man.
You can rest in my daughter's room, bro.

838
01:12:23,858 --> 01:12:27,841
I thought of, like, a million things
to say to you on the plane...

839
01:12:27,872 --> 01:12:29,864
and I can't remember.

840
01:12:31,782 --> 01:12:32,887
Jack...

841
01:12:33,794 --> 01:12:35,702
Glad you're here.

842
01:12:36,839 --> 01:12:39,821
You make it to Memphis after all.<i>did </i>

843
01:12:43,783 --> 01:12:45,712
Fuck.

844
01:12:46,765 --> 01:12:48,704
I won't do this again.

845
01:12:49,821 --> 01:12:51,811
I won't come and find you.

846
01:12:53,907 --> 01:12:56,722
Next time, you can clean up
your own mess.

847
01:12:57,807 --> 01:12:59,746
You understand me?

848
01:13:01,779 --> 01:13:02,926
How was the show?

849
01:13:05,731 --> 01:13:07,785
It was fucking awesome.

850
01:13:08,828 --> 01:13:10,746
I cut the dancers.

851
01:13:10,872 --> 01:13:12,842
- Dancers?
- Yeah.

852
01:13:12,873 --> 01:13:13,915
Ah.

853
01:13:14,896 --> 01:13:16,825
Good.

854
01:13:18,837 --> 01:13:20,756
Fucking dancers.

855
01:13:20,922 --> 01:13:22,810
All you do is need to sing.

856
01:13:22,841 --> 01:13:24,906
- You made me so upset.
- I'm sorry.

857
01:13:26,468 --> 01:13:28,460
I saw that video on YouTube.

858
01:13:28,491 --> 01:13:30,368
- Oh.
- It was great.

859
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,422
Thank you so much.

860
01:13:36,499 --> 01:13:39,429
Excuse me one second.

861
01:13:40,368 --> 01:13:42,442
- What's going on?
- Do you have, like, a plier?

862
01:13:42,474 --> 01:13:43,505
Jack's OK?

863
01:13:43,538 --> 01:13:46,498
I wanna cut the guitar strings,
not too crazy.

864
01:13:46,529 --> 01:13:49,449
There used to be pliers
or something like that.

865
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:51,524
Ah... Yeah, yeah.

866
01:13:52,306 --> 01:13:53,463
I don't know where my mom is.

867
01:13:53,494 --> 01:13:56,435
- Yeah. I understand that.
- I think you're pretty.

868
01:13:56,466 --> 01:13:57,509
Me?

869
01:13:58,479 --> 01:14:02,514
You think I'm pretty?
Thank you. I think you're pretty.

870
01:14:03,389 --> 01:14:06,527
It was real great,
and then Jack tells me you wrote the song.

871
01:14:06,559 --> 01:14:09,520
Yeah, he got me to start singing
my own songs again.

872
01:14:10,417 --> 01:14:13,503
- He has a way of doing that.
- Yeah, he does.

873
01:14:13,534 --> 01:14:16,412
Does anyone want some
more mac and cheese?

874
01:14:16,444 --> 01:14:19,332
Yeah? Here, sweetheart,
you want some?

875
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:23,470
Ah. There he goes.
What's up, man?

876
01:14:23,502 --> 01:14:25,524
I understand what you said.

877
01:14:25,556 --> 01:14:28,486
What the hell are you...

878
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:44,511
Are you kidding?

879
01:14:44,542 --> 01:14:46,419
- That stupid?
- No.

880
01:14:46,451 --> 01:14:49,391
- It's not stupid.
- It wasn't a stupid thing I just did?

881
01:14:49,422 --> 01:14:51,518
Is that what you were doing
when you left the table?

882
01:14:51,549 --> 01:14:53,572
He told me
he was looking for some pliers.

883
01:14:53,604 --> 01:14:57,576
I didn't know what he was gonna do.
I didn't think he was gonna "do it" do it.

884
01:14:57,608 --> 01:15:00,402
Oh, she has another ring!

885
01:15:00,433 --> 01:15:01,559
Well, that's just temporary.

886
01:15:01,591 --> 01:15:04,582
No, no, no, no, no.
Jack, wait a minute.

887
01:15:04,615 --> 01:15:07,606
Let's anoint this.
Let's do it today.

888
01:15:09,556 --> 01:15:11,443
- Yo, for real.
- It's a good idea!

889
01:15:11,475 --> 01:15:14,457
No, you get the dress.
I'll call my cousin right now.

890
01:15:14,488 --> 01:15:16,490
It's Saturday.
Nobody's gonna be in there.

891
01:15:16,521 --> 01:15:18,523
- Let's go.
- You really wanna do that?

892
01:15:18,555 --> 01:15:21,411
That place has a magical quality to it.

893
01:15:21,443 --> 01:15:23,496
It what? It has a magical quality?

894
01:15:23,527 --> 01:15:25,436
- It does.
- What do you mean?

895
01:15:25,467 --> 01:15:26,624
- That church is special.
- We can go.

896
01:15:27,406 --> 01:15:29,533
- I'll take you to get a dress.
- There you go, right there.

897
01:15:29,565 --> 01:15:33,610
It'd be great! OK, you're coming with us
for sure because you're...

898
01:15:33,642 --> 01:15:38,428
I can't believe this.
What am I doing? OK, sure.

899
01:15:49,417 --> 01:15:51,523
- My brother. Good to see you.
- Hey, hey!

900
01:15:51,554 --> 01:15:53,504
- Jack!
- Good to see you, my man.

901
01:15:55,444 --> 01:15:57,540
- Thank you so much.
- Welcome to the Lord's house.

902
01:15:57,571 --> 01:16:00,428
<i>With the power...</i>
<i>I think that's how it goes.</i>

903
01:16:00,459 --> 01:16:02,555
Do you take him...
Do you take him?

904
01:16:03,503 --> 01:16:04,598
I do.

905
01:16:05,599 --> 01:16:07,569
I do.

906
01:16:13,627 --> 01:16:15,588
Congrats, man.

907
01:16:16,537 --> 01:16:18,560
- I listened to what you said.
- I'm glad you did.

908
01:16:18,591 --> 01:16:20,572
I can't believe he did it.

909
01:16:22,605 --> 01:16:25,493
- One thing at a time, OK?
- What?

910
01:16:27,453 --> 01:16:29,601
Oh! I didn't understand.

911
01:17:07,501 --> 01:17:08,638
- Lot of people downstairs?
- Yeah.

912
01:17:08,669 --> 01:17:11,589
- She better come out before they leave.
- Want me to check on her?

913
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:14,581
Well, I think we're gonna
have to go pretty soon, so...

914
01:17:14,613 --> 01:17:16,542
All right.

915
01:17:17,626 --> 01:17:18,700
Ally.

916
01:17:20,681 --> 01:17:22,558
I'm coming in.

917
01:17:26,634 --> 01:17:28,646
What are you doin' in the tub?

918
01:17:31,608 --> 01:17:33,568
This is so weird.

919
01:17:33,599 --> 01:17:36,623
I don't know who the hell
I think I am. I...

920
01:17:36,654 --> 01:17:38,636
One song is fine, but...

921
01:17:39,564 --> 01:17:42,660
..to put out a whole record,
I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.

922
01:17:43,588 --> 01:17:46,674
I don't know about all of that,
but you definitely look like a star.

923
01:17:47,644 --> 01:17:49,604
- Really?
- Yeah.

924
01:17:50,730 --> 01:17:53,577
What do you think of her hair
and the look and the...?

925
01:17:53,608 --> 01:17:54,765
- I discussed it with her.
- Yeah.

926
01:17:55,547 --> 01:17:56,746
- It looks great.
- Was that your choice?

927
01:17:56,778 --> 01:17:58,696
No, it was actually hers.

928
01:18:01,564 --> 01:18:02,731
- No drink?
- What's that?

929
01:18:02,763 --> 01:18:04,692
No drink?

930
01:18:07,631 --> 01:18:09,696
No socks?

931
01:18:10,697 --> 01:18:12,626
Touché. Touché, mate.

932
01:18:12,657 --> 01:18:15,764
Yeah, I could never get used to that,
the idea of not wearing socks.

933
01:18:15,796 --> 01:18:18,694
- Your feet get all...
- No, actually I am wearing socks.

934
01:18:18,726 --> 01:18:21,656
They're these kind of
little female insert socks

935
01:18:21,687 --> 01:18:24,626
- that work with these shoes.
- Oh, you are. You're hiding them.

936
01:18:24,659 --> 01:18:26,722
Yeah, I'm just hiding them.
That's right.

937
01:18:26,754 --> 01:18:28,735
OK, now is this thing...
Yeah, there it is.

938
01:18:28,766 --> 01:18:31,613
Oh, that's a good light.
Here, hold this for me, baby.

939
01:18:31,644 --> 01:18:33,594
Hey, Ally, girl!

940
01:18:33,625 --> 01:18:35,731
<i>Wait, hold on. Come on.</i>
<i>Sookie, Donte. Come here.</i>

941
01:18:35,762 --> 01:18:37,660
I put my Jackson titties on!

942
01:18:37,692 --> 01:18:38,734
Hi!

943
01:18:38,765 --> 01:18:41,737
Baby, listen, we just wanted
to say congratulations.

944
01:18:41,768 --> 01:18:43,635
- Congratulations!
- We love you!

945
01:18:43,666 --> 01:18:45,752
- I love you too.
<i>- Girl, please come back soon.</i>

946
01:18:45,783 --> 01:18:48,764
We done put Etta in your station, girl.

947
01:18:49,703 --> 01:18:51,798
- The queen is here!
- Stop!

948
01:18:52,685 --> 01:18:53,821
- Wow!
- What do you think?

949
01:18:54,603 --> 01:18:55,698
Well, it's beautiful.

950
01:18:55,729 --> 01:18:59,660
You. SNL. Alec Baldwin hosting.

951
01:18:59,692 --> 01:19:00,839
- Did you get it?
- Season finale.

952
01:19:01,621 --> 01:19:02,747
- No fucking way.
- No, got it.<i>you </i>

953
01:19:02,778 --> 01:19:04,676
- No way! Oh, my God!
- No, got it.<i>you </i>

954
01:19:04,707 --> 01:19:06,666
Oh, gosh!

955
01:19:06,834 --> 01:19:09,722
- That's incredible! Thank you.
- Congratulations.

956
01:19:09,753 --> 01:19:11,661
- Congratulations.
- Bitch!

957
01:19:12,662 --> 01:19:13,778
- Oh, my gosh!
- Get downstairs.

958
01:19:13,809 --> 01:19:15,644
- Everyone's waiting.
- OK.

959
01:19:15,675 --> 01:19:17,677
Can I just talk to her
for one second outside?

960
01:19:17,709 --> 01:19:19,721
Just one sec, sorry.
Just be a second, yeah.

961
01:19:28,667 --> 01:19:30,752
It doesn't do you any justice,
I'll tell you that.

962
01:19:31,690 --> 01:19:33,713
You always said you liked my nose.

963
01:19:33,745 --> 01:19:35,819
- I love your nose.
- It's real big up there.

964
01:19:35,851 --> 01:19:37,821
I wish it was bigger up there.

965
01:19:37,853 --> 01:19:40,658
The whole thing should just be
your fucking nose.

966
01:19:41,794 --> 01:19:44,650
Fuck all those people
who ever said anything.

967
01:19:44,683 --> 01:19:46,767
Just put a billboard
of your fucking nose up there.

968
01:19:46,799 --> 01:19:49,645
Just the nose?
That's so ridiculous.

969
01:19:49,832 --> 01:19:53,691
Listen, if I just don't say this,
I'll never forgive myself.

970
01:19:55,713 --> 01:19:56,756
What?

971
01:19:59,874 --> 01:20:02,804
If you don't dig deep
in your fucking soul...

972
01:20:03,794 --> 01:20:05,776
..you won't have legs.

973
01:20:06,891 --> 01:20:09,695
I'm just telling you that.

974
01:20:11,708 --> 01:20:14,679
You don't tell the truth out there,
you're fucked.

975
01:20:15,857 --> 01:20:18,725
All you got is you,
and what you wanna say to people.

976
01:20:18,756 --> 01:20:22,802
They are listening now. They're not
gonna be listening forever. Trust me.

977
01:20:24,741 --> 01:20:26,680
So you gotta grab it.

978
01:20:26,711 --> 01:20:29,808
And you don't apologise, you don't worry
about why they're listening

979
01:20:29,839 --> 01:20:33,739
or how long they're gonna be listening,
you just tell 'em what you wanna say.

980
01:20:44,896 --> 01:20:47,815
Cos how you say it
is the stuff of angels.

981
01:20:49,723 --> 01:20:52,715
Pop! Six to the right, and hah!

982
01:20:52,747 --> 01:20:53,800
Ball, change. Down.

983
01:20:53,831 --> 01:20:55,895
Hah! Ball, change.

984
01:20:57,793 --> 01:20:59,743
- Attitude.
- Whoo!

985
01:20:59,774 --> 01:21:00,911
- The last part.
- I know.

986
01:21:00,942 --> 01:21:02,882
All right!

987
01:21:03,945 --> 01:21:06,896
30 seconds.

988
01:21:09,783 --> 01:21:11,744
Red mark.

989
01:21:12,870 --> 01:21:15,810
Alec in 20.

990
01:21:15,894 --> 01:21:17,739
15.

991
01:21:17,771 --> 01:21:19,814
Stand by, guys.
Here we go. Ready? Song one.

992
01:21:19,846 --> 01:21:20,867
Stand by, Alec.

993
01:21:20,899 --> 01:21:22,963
- In ten, nine...
- Alec in ten.

994
01:21:23,745 --> 01:21:25,768
- eight, seven, six...
- Ready 4. Dissolve 4.

995
01:21:25,799 --> 01:21:26,967
Alec in five seconds.

996
01:21:27,748 --> 01:21:30,960
- Four, three, two, one...
- And go 4. Dissolve 4.

997
01:21:31,742 --> 01:21:33,859
- And cue Alec!
- Ladies and gentlemen, Ally.

998
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:35,944
Dissolve 1.

999
01:22:51,953 --> 01:22:54,873
The caterpillar becomes the butterfly.

1000
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:58,867
What the hell are you doing here?

1001
01:22:58,898 --> 01:23:00,931
I'm in town for a gig.

1002
01:23:00,962 --> 01:23:02,881
Been working for Willie.

1003
01:23:03,058 --> 01:23:05,894
- I've been working for Willie.
- No shit.

1004
01:23:05,926 --> 01:23:08,042
Yeah. Thought I'd stop by
and check her out.

1005
01:23:14,902 --> 01:23:16,842
Is it gettin' worse?

1006
01:23:17,947 --> 01:23:21,044
Nah, I've just been with my wife,
and it's goin' real good.

1007
01:23:25,997 --> 01:23:28,030
Funny to run into you, cos...

1008
01:23:31,929 --> 01:23:34,994
..I was thinking about asking you
to come back out with us.

1009
01:23:38,081 --> 01:23:40,917
I gotta say, it's easier without you.

1010
01:23:48,914 --> 01:23:49,967
Listen.

1011
01:23:51,041 --> 01:23:52,970
You run into any trouble...

1012
01:23:53,898 --> 01:23:55,910
..call me.

1013
01:24:13,896 --> 01:24:15,105
Thank you!

1014
01:24:51,056 --> 01:24:53,162
That light's beautiful.

1015
01:24:54,945 --> 01:24:56,176
Oh, God, here we...

1016
01:24:56,958 --> 01:24:59,106
Yeah, that's it, Ally.
Yeah, that's it.

1017
01:25:00,127 --> 01:25:03,162
That's it, Ally. That's it, I love that.

1018
01:25:04,966 --> 01:25:07,062
Oh, my gosh. It's so early.
I've been here all night.

1019
01:25:07,093 --> 01:25:09,178
- Early for me, late for you.
- Hi, it's nice to see you.

1020
01:25:09,959 --> 01:25:11,065
- How you doin'?
- I'm kind of...

1021
01:25:11,097 --> 01:25:12,983
- He's amazing.
- What do you think?

1022
01:25:13,014 --> 01:25:14,975
These fucking photos.

1023
01:25:15,006 --> 01:25:17,133
- They're so beautiful.
- Look at that! Look at that!

1024
01:25:17,164 --> 01:25:20,094
- That's incredible.
- It doesn't even look like me.

1025
01:25:23,202 --> 01:25:26,142
You've just been nominated
for three Grammys.

1026
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:29,166
Including Best New Artist.

1027
01:25:30,209 --> 01:25:32,158
They just announced it now.

1028
01:25:40,103 --> 01:25:43,085
Everybody!
Grammy-nominated artist.

1029
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:20,203
Have you been drinking?
Are you fucked up right now?

1030
01:26:20,235 --> 01:26:22,112
I'm out a couple.

1031
01:26:22,143 --> 01:26:24,051
It's the morning.

1032
01:26:26,262 --> 01:26:28,191
Yup.

1033
01:26:34,185 --> 01:26:36,093
Hey, buddy.

1034
01:27:03,172 --> 01:27:07,092
You're nominated for three Grammys,
and it's fucking great.

1035
01:27:07,123 --> 01:27:09,271
Thank you.
How did you find that out?

1036
01:27:10,283 --> 01:27:12,159
Bobby told me.

1037
01:27:13,307 --> 01:27:15,266
He called. He said that...

1038
01:27:16,204 --> 01:27:20,188
..they wanna do some Roy Orbison tribute.
They want me to sing and shit.

1039
01:27:20,219 --> 01:27:22,190
- Great.
- Some, like, supergroup thing.

1040
01:27:22,221 --> 01:27:25,099
But the point is, you got nominated,
and it's great.

1041
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:28,216
I'm just trying to figure it out,
that's all.

1042
01:27:31,167 --> 01:27:34,306
"Why do you come around me
with an ass like that?"

1043
01:27:37,141 --> 01:27:39,112
- My lyrics?
- "Why do you walk around in jeans?"

1044
01:27:39,143 --> 01:27:41,093
"Why do you come around
with an ass like that?"

1045
01:27:41,124 --> 01:27:43,168
Yeah, that's my song.
What about my song?

1046
01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:46,202
I fucking listened to it
over and over in the fucking...

1047
01:27:47,328 --> 01:27:49,216
You're not making any sense.

1048
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:53,251
Yeah, just keep drinking.

1049
01:27:53,282 --> 01:27:56,201
- That'll give you the answer.
- Maybe I fucking failed you.

1050
01:27:56,232 --> 01:27:59,162
- That kills me. I'm sorry.
- You what? You failed me?

1051
01:27:59,193 --> 01:28:01,216
Yeah, you're embarrassing,
and it's just...

1052
01:28:01,247 --> 01:28:03,270
- I'm embarrassing?
- I feel bad for you.

1053
01:28:03,301 --> 01:28:05,168
- Yeah...
- I'm not embarrassing!

1054
01:28:05,199 --> 01:28:07,295
- I have to tell you.
- You're embarrassing!

1055
01:28:07,326 --> 01:28:11,237
You're so embarrassed of your fucking
self that you gotta put me down.

1056
01:28:11,268 --> 01:28:13,291
You're worried that you're ugly,
and you're not.

1057
01:28:13,322 --> 01:28:15,344
So you need to get approval
by all these people.

1058
01:28:16,126 --> 01:28:18,253
- Why can't I just be enough for you?
- I don't need approval.

1059
01:28:18,284 --> 01:28:21,277
I'd like for my boyfriend to love me.
For my to love me.<i>husband </i>

1060
01:28:21,308 --> 01:28:24,144
Who's your fucking boyfriend?
You have a boyfriend?

1061
01:28:24,176 --> 01:28:26,178
- Yeah, I've got a boyfriend.
- That hurts.

1062
01:28:26,209 --> 01:28:28,325
- I have a boyfriend.
- Call me your fucking boyfriend.

1063
01:28:28,357 --> 01:28:32,236
You're my boyfriend. You're my boyfriend
if you don't treat me like your wife.

1064
01:28:32,267 --> 01:28:34,299
I don't even know
what that fucking means.

1065
01:28:34,331 --> 01:28:37,375
It means clean your shit up.
You're fucking messy.

1066
01:28:38,157 --> 01:28:40,295
- That's what it means.
- Well, that's not true.

1067
01:28:40,326 --> 01:28:42,151
- Oh, it isn't?
- Uh-uh.

1068
01:28:42,182 --> 01:28:45,216
Let's go. You wanna be my drinking buddy?
Wanna practise?

1069
01:28:45,248 --> 01:28:48,240
- I don't think you could handle it.
- You don't? Let me see.

1070
01:28:49,252 --> 01:28:53,171
Know why? Cos you're too worried about
what everybody else is thinking.

1071
01:28:53,203 --> 01:28:55,298
Here we go, Jack.
You want me to be your dad?

1072
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:57,207
- Be your drinking buddy?
- Yeah.

1073
01:28:57,238 --> 01:28:59,313
Yeah, you couldn't be my dad
if you fucking tried.

1074
01:28:59,344 --> 01:29:02,389
He had more talent in his finger
than you have in your whole body.

1075
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:05,371
So don't even fucking go there
about that, all right?

1076
01:29:05,402 --> 01:29:09,208
- That's over the fucking line.
- Why don't you have another drink

1077
01:29:09,239 --> 01:29:12,378
and we can just get fucking drunk
until we fucking disappear, OK?

1078
01:29:12,409 --> 01:29:16,204
- Do you got those pills?
- You're just fucking ugly, that's all.

1079
01:29:16,235 --> 01:29:18,310
- I'm what?
- You're just fucking ugly.

1080
01:29:18,341 --> 01:29:20,333
Get the fuck out!

1081
01:29:20,364 --> 01:29:22,220
Get out!

1082
01:29:23,221 --> 01:29:25,202
I said, get out!

1083
01:29:25,234 --> 01:29:26,412
Fine.

1084
01:29:47,255 --> 01:29:48,297
Good evening.

1085
01:30:00,225 --> 01:30:01,361
Seven and eight and huh.

1086
01:30:01,393 --> 01:30:04,427
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, up!

1087
01:30:04,458 --> 01:30:06,366
Pull it!

1088
01:30:07,472 --> 01:30:10,329
Six. Come on, feel it. Ooh-huh.

1089
01:30:13,268 --> 01:30:15,354
Down, up! Hah! Swing it!

1090
01:30:26,292 --> 01:30:28,398
- That was great.
- What are you doin' here?

1091
01:30:28,429 --> 01:30:32,433
Something fell through, so I was able
to come back a few days early.

1092
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:38,376
I think I might have said some things...

1093
01:30:43,287 --> 01:30:46,269
Just...how I acted.

1094
01:30:48,271 --> 01:30:49,397
You hurt me.

1095
01:30:51,326 --> 01:30:53,285
You really hurt me.

1096
01:30:53,318 --> 01:30:54,496
Sorry.

1097
01:31:11,512 --> 01:31:13,472
You haven't been drinking.

1098
01:31:14,421 --> 01:31:15,453
What'd you say?

1099
01:31:15,484 --> 01:31:18,414
I said you haven't been drinking.
I can tell.

1100
01:31:18,445 --> 01:31:20,343
No, I haven't. No.

1101
01:31:21,406 --> 01:31:25,306
- I have to get back to rehearsal...
- Oh, yeah. Can I watch?

1102
01:31:26,380 --> 01:31:28,319
Yeah, OK.

1103
01:31:28,351 --> 01:31:30,311
Meet me at home.

1104
01:31:30,342 --> 01:31:32,344
Or I can wait and drive you home.

1105
01:31:33,512 --> 01:31:35,420
- Just meet me at home.
- OK.

1106
01:31:36,494 --> 01:31:38,505
What do you mean,
they don't want me to sing?

1107
01:31:38,537 --> 01:31:41,331
They hired this fucking kid
at the last minute.

1108
01:31:41,363 --> 01:31:43,427
They didn't tell me a fucking thing.

1109
01:31:48,390 --> 01:31:50,497
Look, we've been
on that other side before.

1110
01:31:51,456 --> 01:31:53,375
More than once.

1111
01:31:53,406 --> 01:31:54,449
Yeah.

1112
01:31:55,450 --> 01:31:57,388
Truth is, I didn't deliver.

1113
01:31:58,337 --> 01:32:00,401
Well, it's a good thing I know the...

1114
01:32:01,465 --> 01:32:04,447
..how to play the guitar.
It's fine, I'll do it.

1115
01:32:05,531 --> 01:32:07,533
- You're gonna do it?
- Sure.

1116
01:32:15,395 --> 01:32:17,596
Hey, where's the wedges?
Can't fucking hear with the...

1117
01:32:49,511 --> 01:32:52,472
But, yeah, like I said,
it's a real, real honour.

1118
01:32:52,504 --> 01:32:54,516
Yeah. Oh, honour's mine.

1119
01:32:54,547 --> 01:32:56,444
Yeah, you're great. It'll be fun.

1120
01:32:56,475 --> 01:32:58,394
- Yeah, hope so.
- Yeah.

1121
01:33:06,121 --> 01:33:09,082
Who coulda been a crooner?

1122
01:33:09,113 --> 01:33:12,106
Right? You remember what Paul said.

1123
01:33:12,137 --> 01:33:16,172
Paul Anka
told me I had more natural talent...

1124
01:33:16,203 --> 01:33:18,080
- ..than Sinatra.
- ..than Frank.

1125
01:33:18,112 --> 01:33:20,020
- That's it! Do not...
- Direct quote!

1126
01:33:20,051 --> 01:33:21,240
Know what Paul Anka actually said?

1127
01:33:22,022 --> 01:33:24,034
- No, what did he say?
- He said...

1128
01:33:24,065 --> 01:33:28,027
"Would you please pull the car over
and let me out over here on the kerb?"

1129
01:33:28,058 --> 01:33:31,155
All right, but... Oh, my God!

1130
01:33:32,104 --> 01:33:33,230
Sweetheart.

1131
01:33:34,012 --> 01:33:35,253
This is unreal.

1132
01:33:36,035 --> 01:33:37,192
The Grammys.

1133
01:33:37,223 --> 01:33:40,185
- Hey, look at everybody. How are you?
- Hey, there he is!

1134
01:33:40,216 --> 01:33:42,197
- Oh, thanks.
- How are you?

1135
01:33:43,208 --> 01:33:45,075
Are you OK?

1136
01:33:45,106 --> 01:33:47,098
- What's that?
- Are you OK?

1137
01:33:47,233 --> 01:33:49,057
- Are you OK?
- Oh.

1138
01:33:49,088 --> 01:33:50,142
- I'm great.
- Are you sure?

1139
01:33:50,173 --> 01:33:52,029
Yeah, I'm great.

1140
01:33:52,060 --> 01:33:55,042
They have me going in early,
so I gotta go now and then...

1141
01:33:55,074 --> 01:33:58,170
But I made sure that they tell me where
you're sitting so I can go right after.

1142
01:33:58,202 --> 01:34:00,131
- OK.
- I don't wanna miss the award.

1143
01:34:00,162 --> 01:34:01,246
- OK.
- It's right before it.

1144
01:34:01,278 --> 01:34:03,207
You just got that look on your face.

1145
01:34:03,238 --> 01:34:05,282
I do? Watch. It's gone.

1146
01:34:06,064 --> 01:34:08,097
Amazing. Gonna get to see
you perform tonight,

1147
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:09,233
get to see you sing.

1148
01:34:09,265 --> 01:34:14,290
Hey, Jack, that's an incredible...
collection of vinyl you have in there.

1149
01:34:15,072 --> 01:34:17,074
Take whatever you want.
It's yours.

1150
01:34:17,230 --> 01:34:20,243
- Take whatever I want?
- He just said, "Take whatever you want."

1151
01:34:20,275 --> 01:34:23,163
He's talking to the wrong guys.

1152
01:35:04,098 --> 01:35:05,307
I thought he was supposed to be singing.

1153
01:36:14,393 --> 01:36:17,188
Oh, it's over? It's over?

1154
01:36:18,345 --> 01:36:20,285
- You good?
- I'm fine.

1155
01:36:27,292 --> 01:36:29,273
And the nominees are...

1156
01:36:29,304 --> 01:36:31,253
- Right here?
<i>- Roxy Carlile.</i>

1157
01:36:31,284 --> 01:36:32,337
Hi. Are you OK?

1158
01:36:32,369 --> 01:36:35,288
Come on, baby.
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

1159
01:36:35,319 --> 01:36:38,343
- Hi. You OK?
- I was trying to go to the men's room

1160
01:36:38,374 --> 01:36:41,263
- and they rushed me over here.
- OK, put your legs inside.

1161
01:36:41,294 --> 01:36:43,421
- I had to go to the bathroom.
- Put your legs inside.

1162
01:36:44,203 --> 01:36:46,414
They're announcing your fucking category.
Keep quiet.

1163
01:36:47,196 --> 01:36:49,396
- And the winner is...
- Yeah... Oh...

1164
01:36:49,427 --> 01:36:51,377
This is exciting.

1165
01:36:51,408 --> 01:36:53,201
How great.

1166
01:36:53,232 --> 01:36:54,400
Ally!

1167
01:36:58,310 --> 01:37:01,251
Oh, my God!

1168
01:37:01,417 --> 01:37:03,388
Oh, my God!

1169
01:37:05,421 --> 01:37:08,258
- What happened?
- We won!

1170
01:37:08,289 --> 01:37:11,249
- Is that why everybody's...
- Yep, that's right!

1171
01:37:13,345 --> 01:37:15,243
Where are we going?

1172
01:37:15,274 --> 01:37:17,234
Just stay right here.
Go sit back there.

1173
01:37:17,266 --> 01:37:18,402
Go sit back there.

1174
01:37:20,414 --> 01:37:22,448
I'll stay here.

1175
01:37:28,235 --> 01:37:31,457
Oh, my gosh, thank you!
You look beautiful. Thank you!

1176
01:37:32,406 --> 01:37:34,365
Oh, wow!

1177
01:37:34,396 --> 01:37:36,367
Oh, my gosh!

1178
01:37:36,398 --> 01:37:39,328
I can't believe I'm holding one of these.

1179
01:37:39,453 --> 01:37:42,415
Thank you to Rez Gavron, my manager.

1180
01:37:42,446 --> 01:37:45,407
- Thank you for believing in me...
- Wait, did you win?

1181
01:37:45,438 --> 01:37:48,483
..and telling me to get back from
behind the piano and onto the stage.

1182
01:37:49,265 --> 01:37:51,497
Did you just win?

1183
01:37:53,436 --> 01:37:57,314
Thank you to my...my...
to Jack Maine, my husband.

1184
01:37:57,345 --> 01:37:59,410
- Should I come up there?
- I love you so much.

1185
01:37:59,441 --> 01:38:02,507
I always wanted to be a singer
on a big stage

1186
01:38:03,289 --> 01:38:05,364
and because of him, I am.

1187
01:38:08,492 --> 01:38:11,422
- We're having a lot of fun tonight.
- Yeah.

1188
01:38:12,464 --> 01:38:14,288
- I...
- Shit.

1189
01:38:15,310 --> 01:38:16,363
Look.

1190
01:38:22,484 --> 01:38:25,518
- If I haven't thanked you yet, just...
- Did you see you're up there?

1191
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:27,406
Yeah, I do.

1192
01:38:29,314 --> 01:38:32,347
I started out singing
with this beautiful man

1193
01:38:32,378 --> 01:38:34,432
and I'll sing with him for life.

1194
01:38:34,464 --> 01:38:36,466
- Right, baby?
- Yeah.

1195
01:38:39,417 --> 01:38:41,544
I'm so blessed to be in the company

1196
01:38:42,326 --> 01:38:44,505
of such wonderful musicians.

1197
01:38:44,536 --> 01:38:47,310
This is a dream come true,
and all I can say is...

1198
01:38:47,341 --> 01:38:49,489
..believe in yourself and don't give up

1199
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:51,522
because there is a spot
on that stage for you.

1200
01:38:51,554 --> 01:38:54,347
- Oh, shit. Oh, fuck.
- Good night.

1201
01:38:54,557 --> 01:38:56,558
Oh, I think I peed...

1202
01:38:58,341 --> 01:38:59,508
- I think I peed myself.
- Turn around.

1203
01:38:59,540 --> 01:39:01,427
Oh!

1204
01:39:03,398 --> 01:39:05,369
- I think I...
- Baby, baby, can you...

1205
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:06,568
- That's a bad come down.
- Holy shit!

1206
01:39:07,350 --> 01:39:10,426
- Take him to the shower.
- Follow me, Wolf. Ally, go inside, OK?

1207
01:39:10,457 --> 01:39:12,354
- It's on the left, Dad.
- I got it.

1208
01:39:12,385 --> 01:39:13,522
- Go inside!
- They got him.

1209
01:39:13,554 --> 01:39:15,409
- They got him!
- It's my job!

1210
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:17,400
- Don't do this to my daughter!
- Hey, hey!

1211
01:39:17,432 --> 01:39:19,340
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1212
01:39:19,371 --> 01:39:20,508
Get off!

1213
01:39:21,550 --> 01:39:23,427
Damn it!

1214
01:39:23,459 --> 01:39:25,440
Watch his fucking head.

1215
01:39:26,430 --> 01:39:27,463
Watch! Watch!

1216
01:39:28,578 --> 01:39:30,507
Bobby'll take you there.

1217
01:39:32,405 --> 01:39:34,437
You have Bobby's number?

1218
01:39:36,408 --> 01:39:38,504
No, Jack, you gotta sit up.

1219
01:39:40,370 --> 01:39:42,581
I don't want you to choke, baby. Sit up!

1220
01:39:43,363 --> 01:39:45,500
Sorry, I...I might've taken too much.

1221
01:39:45,532 --> 01:39:48,389
- You all right in there?
- I'm fine.

1222
01:39:49,515 --> 01:39:51,506
He's fine.

1223
01:39:54,520 --> 01:39:57,397
So, everybody has their journal...

1224
01:39:57,428 --> 01:39:59,524
and we remember
the homework assignment -

1225
01:39:59,555 --> 01:40:02,496
the three things that I wanted you
to write down.

1226
01:40:03,403 --> 01:40:05,603
- Jack, hey.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm late.

1227
01:40:06,614 --> 01:40:08,564
You can't be late, Jack.

1228
01:40:09,544 --> 01:40:11,463
Understood. Sorry.

1229
01:40:11,494 --> 01:40:13,548
Good. Where's your journal?

1230
01:40:15,487 --> 01:40:17,635
- It's in my room.
- No, no, no, no. No.

1231
01:40:19,459 --> 01:40:20,638
Sit down.

1232
01:40:21,607 --> 01:40:24,485
So, it's all agreed.
Nobody's ever late here, right?

1233
01:40:24,517 --> 01:40:26,571
OK. Good.

1234
01:40:28,448 --> 01:40:30,460
Anything you wanna tell us?

1235
01:40:30,491 --> 01:40:32,493
Um...

1236
01:40:36,507 --> 01:40:38,415
I'm grateful to...

1237
01:40:40,438 --> 01:40:42,450
..to be here and...

1238
01:40:44,483 --> 01:40:46,496
..trying to hold it together.

1239
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:51,490
I'm Jack. I'm an alcoholic.

1240
01:40:51,522 --> 01:40:53,471
Jack.

1241
01:40:53,503 --> 01:40:54,629
Drug addict.

1242
01:41:08,569 --> 01:41:10,550
Oh...

1243
01:41:10,581 --> 01:41:13,522
- This is all my fault.
- You don't have that kind of power, Dad.

1244
01:41:13,553 --> 01:41:15,492
Eat your dinner. Eat your food.

1245
01:41:15,523 --> 01:41:17,608
Sorry.
I don't even know what meal it is.

1246
01:41:20,486 --> 01:41:21,612
Go on, have some fruit.

1247
01:41:24,532 --> 01:41:27,587
How many times did you carry
my piano up the stairs?

1248
01:41:29,589 --> 01:41:32,644
How many times did you sit there
while I wrote a song?

1249
01:41:36,491 --> 01:41:38,639
- Always.
- OK, it's OK. It's OK.

1250
01:41:39,546 --> 01:41:41,610
You didn't do anything.
It's not your fault.

1251
01:41:44,551 --> 01:41:46,678
You're just the greatest person
in the world.

1252
01:41:55,540 --> 01:41:57,667
<i>How long have you been here now?</i>

1253
01:41:58,710 --> 01:42:00,608
<i>Two months.</i>

1254
01:42:02,672 --> 01:42:04,497
Can it be fixed?

1255
01:42:04,528 --> 01:42:06,739
Well, you would know that, don't you?
Once it's gone, it's gone.

1256
01:42:07,521 --> 01:42:10,576
- I don't know what you have.
- Oh, the tinnitus, they say, once you...

1257
01:42:10,607 --> 01:42:13,537
- Well, tinnitus can't be fixed.
- Right.

1258
01:42:14,580 --> 01:42:18,572
Well, I just hear that tone, that's all.
The tone, yeah.

1259
01:42:18,604 --> 01:42:20,564
The ringing.

1260
01:42:20,595 --> 01:42:23,577
- I have hearing aids on, as you...
- I know. That's why I asked you.

1261
01:42:23,609 --> 01:42:25,621
You know, I'm convinced that...

1262
01:42:27,550 --> 01:42:29,615
..it happened when I was younger.
I used to...

1263
01:42:29,646 --> 01:42:33,587
My dad had, like, a Victrola,
you know, an old record player.

1264
01:42:33,619 --> 01:42:36,579
My head was just about the size of it
when I was a kid,

1265
01:42:36,610 --> 01:42:39,613
and I used to love to just
put my whole head in there.

1266
01:42:40,541 --> 01:42:43,596
He was big into the blues, so...

1267
01:42:44,722 --> 01:42:47,684
Cos you gotta figure,
it's just me and him all day long.

1268
01:42:47,715 --> 01:42:51,782
My brother's out there
tryin' to make something of himself.

1269
01:42:53,638 --> 01:42:56,766
So I took one of his belts.
I put it around the...

1270
01:42:58,548 --> 01:42:59,747
..ceiling fan and...

1271
01:43:00,790 --> 01:43:02,677
..tried to do the deed.

1272
01:43:04,648 --> 01:43:06,775
The whole fucking fan
came out of the ceiling.

1273
01:43:14,741 --> 01:43:17,670
Had a big cut on my fucking forehead.

1274
01:43:18,598 --> 01:43:21,810
I was more mad about that
than it not working.

1275
01:43:23,780 --> 01:43:25,730
And he didn't even notice.

1276
01:43:27,597 --> 01:43:28,702
He didn't even fucking notice.

1277
01:43:28,733 --> 01:43:30,704
- Cos he was drunk?
- Yeah.

1278
01:43:33,644 --> 01:43:36,793
That fucking fan stayed on the floor
for about half a year.

1279
01:43:39,639 --> 01:43:41,631
How old were you then?

1280
01:43:41,662 --> 01:43:43,664
I was just shy of 13.

1281
01:43:52,715 --> 01:43:54,696
Oh...

1282
01:43:58,782 --> 01:44:00,763
You smell good.

1283
01:44:00,794 --> 01:44:03,797
You smell good,
and you look good too.

1284
01:44:07,781 --> 01:44:09,793
- I've been swimming.
- You've been swimming?

1285
01:44:09,824 --> 01:44:12,754
- Yeah, there's a pool.
- I love that you're swimming.

1286
01:44:12,786 --> 01:44:15,621
- That's a great pool there.
- Yeah.

1287
01:44:15,653 --> 01:44:16,696
How's Charlie?

1288
01:44:16,727 --> 01:44:18,749
Oh, Charlie's sweet.

1289
01:44:18,780 --> 01:44:21,669
He just sort of sits
by the door like this.

1290
01:44:24,703 --> 01:44:25,850
Waiting for Daddy.

1291
01:44:29,875 --> 01:44:31,814
We're both waiting for Daddy.

1292
01:44:34,869 --> 01:44:36,788
What, three weeks?

1293
01:44:37,778 --> 01:44:39,821
You gonna come back, right?<i>are </i>

1294
01:44:40,780 --> 01:44:44,753
- What do you mean?
- You gonna come home when you're done?

1295
01:44:44,784 --> 01:44:46,859
- Do you not want me to?
- No, I want you to.

1296
01:44:46,891 --> 01:44:50,728
- I'm just wondering if... I just...
- Where else would I go?

1297
01:44:50,759 --> 01:44:52,824
- I don't know. I guess I just thought...
- Why...

1298
01:44:52,855 --> 01:44:54,721
- ..there's Jack...
- Wait, wait.

1299
01:44:54,753 --> 01:44:57,703
- Wait. Why would you say that?
- I don't know. I guess...

1300
01:44:57,734 --> 01:45:00,851
I wondered, without the booze,
if you would want to come home.

1301
01:45:00,883 --> 01:45:03,886
Cos when you met me,
you were drinking, and now you're not.

1302
01:45:04,668 --> 01:45:06,701
I wasn't drunk the whole time
we were together.

1303
01:45:06,732 --> 01:45:08,724
I know, but...

1304
01:45:09,850 --> 01:45:12,728
But it got bad when we were together.

1305
01:45:12,759 --> 01:45:14,761
It's OK. I mean, it's fine.

1306
01:45:14,793 --> 01:45:16,867
I just was wondering, that's all,

1307
01:45:16,899 --> 01:45:20,745
and whatever you want is OK.

1308
01:45:20,777 --> 01:45:22,872
Whatever I want?
I wanna be with you.

1309
01:45:22,904 --> 01:45:25,875
- That's why I'm here.
- OK. I know, I know.

1310
01:45:25,907 --> 01:45:28,753
I just want you to be happy.

1311
01:45:29,838 --> 01:45:31,756
I'm working on that.

1312
01:45:35,740 --> 01:45:36,907
I need to stick with you.

1313
01:45:40,869 --> 01:45:42,746
I brought something.

1314
01:45:44,935 --> 01:45:46,937
I wanna know...

1315
01:45:47,855 --> 01:45:49,794
..what this is.

1316
01:45:50,868 --> 01:45:52,849
"My Love."

1317
01:45:53,767 --> 01:45:55,863
You hiding love songs?

1318
01:45:55,894 --> 01:45:57,906
No, I wouldn't...

1319
01:45:57,938 --> 01:46:00,856
I wouldn't say I was hiding it.
I just um...

1320
01:46:03,745 --> 01:46:06,737
I started puttin' it down to paper
when we were at home.

1321
01:46:08,906 --> 01:46:12,785
I don't know, it sort of fell out of me,
I guess, and onto this page.

1322
01:46:16,883 --> 01:46:18,937
And I put it in here, and I thought...

1323
01:46:21,897 --> 01:46:24,963
I thought maybe you'd find it when...

1324
01:46:28,852 --> 01:46:30,854
..when you came back to you, maybe.

1325
01:46:39,967 --> 01:46:41,843
Well, I found it.

1326
01:46:49,893 --> 01:46:51,832
Listen. Um...

1327
01:46:56,858 --> 01:46:57,953
Um...

1328
01:47:12,967 --> 01:47:14,959
I'm sorry.

1329
01:47:21,881 --> 01:47:23,007
It's OK.

1330
01:47:29,837 --> 01:47:31,933
It's OK. It's not your fault.

1331
01:47:31,964 --> 01:47:33,956
I'm sorry I did that.

1332
01:47:35,999 --> 01:47:37,949
It's OK.

1333
01:47:37,981 --> 01:47:40,816
It's not your fault. It's a disease.

1334
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:44,882
No, but I embarrassed you.

1335
01:47:46,926 --> 01:47:49,940
- I embarrassed you, and I...
- I'm not embarrassed of you.

1336
01:47:50,847 --> 01:47:52,035
It was so wrong.

1337
01:47:53,026 --> 01:47:55,966
And then your...then your dad...

1338
01:47:58,864 --> 01:48:00,835
My father loves you. It's OK.

1339
01:48:03,004 --> 01:48:04,933
I know, but I...

1340
01:48:07,060 --> 01:48:09,875
- It's OK.
- I know, but I...

1341
01:48:10,011 --> 01:48:11,971
It's OK.

1342
01:48:13,024 --> 01:48:14,901
It's OK.

1343
01:48:15,975 --> 01:48:19,853
I have figured out what I think is
the best solution for both of us.

1344
01:48:19,884 --> 01:48:21,928
Jack should come out on tour with me.

1345
01:48:21,959 --> 01:48:24,076
We'll start with our duets.
I know he's gonna be able

1346
01:48:24,858 --> 01:48:27,047
- to play by himself.
- You realise that's not an option.

1347
01:48:27,079 --> 01:48:30,906
He's... He's so inside of his art
in a way he has never been.

1348
01:48:30,937 --> 01:48:33,095
- He can hear himself again.
- Ally, there is no way

1349
01:48:33,877 --> 01:48:36,912
that you can take Jack on tour with you.
There's no way.

1350
01:48:50,038 --> 01:48:51,978
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1351
01:48:52,009 --> 01:48:55,043
If you can't make that happen,
then fucking cancel the tour.

1352
01:48:55,074 --> 01:48:57,076
I don't know what to tell you.

1353
01:49:14,134 --> 01:49:18,003
I think if we had a better band name,
we might've made it.

1354
01:49:20,994 --> 01:49:24,101
Or maybe it was cos we looked like
a father and son duo.

1355
01:49:24,133 --> 01:49:28,074
Not many of those around.

1356
01:49:28,105 --> 01:49:31,932
I was not a good look for you,
that's for sure.

1357
01:49:31,964 --> 01:49:34,164
Not my fault I couldn't find
a better guitar player

1358
01:49:34,946 --> 01:49:37,000
in the whole goddamn state.

1359
01:49:43,036 --> 01:49:44,163
Where in the fuck is it?

1360
01:49:45,153 --> 01:49:47,030
Right here.

1361
01:49:55,027 --> 01:49:56,153
Thanks for the ride.

1362
01:50:00,001 --> 01:50:01,169
Sure thing, Jack.

1363
01:50:03,171 --> 01:50:07,049
Hey, you know...when I...

1364
01:50:15,130 --> 01:50:17,987
..when I said I...
you know, when I...

1365
01:50:25,076 --> 01:50:27,109
..took your voice, you know.

1366
01:50:36,994 --> 01:50:39,028
It was you I idolised. It wasn't Dad.

1367
01:51:27,073 --> 01:51:28,219
Come here.

1368
01:51:30,190 --> 01:51:32,265
What was that, guy?

1369
01:51:42,254 --> 01:51:44,099
Hey.

1370
01:51:44,267 --> 01:51:46,164
Hey.

1371
01:51:48,051 --> 01:51:50,053
I wanna know how you hear this.

1372
01:51:51,137 --> 01:51:53,212
That sounded unbelievable,
what you were playing.

1373
01:51:53,243 --> 01:51:55,214
- Thank you.
- It's nice to hear it.

1374
01:51:55,245 --> 01:51:59,218
Thank you, and I had
the beautiful backdrop of you and Charlie.

1375
01:52:01,189 --> 01:52:03,274
I only heard it in my mind
for so many weeks,

1376
01:52:03,306 --> 01:52:06,266
so it's good to hear it... You know.

1377
01:52:06,297 --> 01:52:10,124
- The words are beautiful.
- ..in the real thing. In the real thing.

1378
01:52:15,233 --> 01:52:17,277
- Well, you want me to do that?
- Mm-hm.

1379
01:52:17,308 --> 01:52:20,217
Oh, God, I don't know.
I knew you were gonna ask me.

1380
01:52:46,158 --> 01:52:48,181
Back from the dead.

1381
01:52:50,162 --> 01:52:52,237
- Hey, sorry. Were you waiting long?
- No, no.

1382
01:52:54,156 --> 01:52:56,168
Uh... Ally's not home.

1383
01:52:56,199 --> 01:52:58,274
No, I told her I'd meet her here,
if that's OK.

1384
01:52:58,305 --> 01:53:00,120
Of course, yeah.

1385
01:53:05,333 --> 01:53:07,147
Here you go.

1386
01:53:07,178 --> 01:53:10,275
Hey, thanks for taking care of my girl
when I was gone.

1387
01:53:10,306 --> 01:53:12,183
Anything for her.

1388
01:53:13,236 --> 01:53:15,374
She told me about that European leg.

1389
01:53:16,302 --> 01:53:19,357
That's a hell of an accomplishment
this soon out of the gate.

1390
01:53:20,139 --> 01:53:25,268
Shit, I remember it was like...ten years
before I even went across the pond.

1391
01:53:25,300 --> 01:53:27,249
It was summer, 2004.

1392
01:53:27,280 --> 01:53:29,262
Shit, was it?

1393
01:53:35,184 --> 01:53:37,165
We're not exactly friends here.

1394
01:53:40,189 --> 01:53:43,203
While you've been away,
we've been back here in serious triage,

1395
01:53:43,234 --> 01:53:45,330
trying to clean up your fucking mess.

1396
01:53:45,361 --> 01:53:47,372
Barely finding our way through it.

1397
01:53:49,353 --> 01:53:53,399
You almost single-handedly derailed
her whole career. You understand that?

1398
01:53:54,181 --> 01:53:56,183
She's never gonna say this to you.

1399
01:53:57,226 --> 01:53:58,394
She loves you too much.

1400
01:54:00,364 --> 01:54:03,232
Just by staying married to you,
she looks like a joke.

1401
01:54:03,263 --> 01:54:04,410
It's embarrassing.

1402
01:54:06,265 --> 01:54:08,403
Let's be honest, we both know
it's only a matter of time

1403
01:54:09,185 --> 01:54:11,374
before that's pushed aside again
for the real thing.

1404
01:54:12,386 --> 01:54:14,325
And when that happens...

1405
01:54:15,410 --> 01:54:18,194
..I don't want her anywhere near you.

1406
01:54:29,505 --> 01:54:30,632
Hey.

1407
01:54:34,531 --> 01:54:35,678
I have some good news.

1408
01:54:36,637 --> 01:54:38,556
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

1409
01:54:38,587 --> 01:54:40,558
I'm not gonna go to Europe.

1410
01:54:41,538 --> 01:54:45,626
We're gonna cancel the rest of the tour,
and I'm just gonna be here all summer.

1411
01:54:48,514 --> 01:54:49,671
Isn't that great?

1412
01:54:51,599 --> 01:54:53,726
- What happened?
- Nothing happened.

1413
01:54:54,675 --> 01:54:57,730
The label just loves the record,
and it's doing so well

1414
01:54:57,762 --> 01:55:02,735
and they wanna keep with the momentum
and have me make another one.

1415
01:55:03,768 --> 01:55:07,553
Rez is super psyched, so it'll be great.

1416
01:55:09,721 --> 01:55:11,765
So tonight's gonna be my last show.

1417
01:55:13,683 --> 01:55:16,582
Going out with a bang at the Forum.

1418
01:55:19,595 --> 01:55:20,617
Great.

1419
01:55:20,648 --> 01:55:21,743
Yeah.

1420
01:55:25,705 --> 01:55:27,697
Why don't you come with me?

1421
01:55:29,688 --> 01:55:33,639
We can sing Shallow together.
The fans will go crazy to see you.

1422
01:55:37,560 --> 01:55:38,801
Come on, cowboy.

1423
01:55:43,722 --> 01:55:45,662
Yeah, why not? OK.

1424
01:55:47,601 --> 01:55:48,706
Yeah?

1425
01:55:48,738 --> 01:55:50,594
OK, good.

1426
01:55:50,625 --> 01:55:51,803
I'll have a car come get you.

1427
01:55:52,584 --> 01:55:54,576
When I... Once I get there.

1428
01:55:54,607 --> 01:55:55,744
I'll go meet you there.

1429
01:56:04,805 --> 01:56:06,807
I'll see you soon, OK?

1430
01:56:11,676 --> 01:56:13,594
Hey.

1431
01:56:13,698 --> 01:56:15,679
What?

1432
01:56:17,671 --> 01:56:19,787
I just wanted to take
another look at you.

1433
01:56:23,729 --> 01:56:25,783
Bye, honey.

1434
01:56:26,826 --> 01:56:28,828
Bye.

1435
01:56:59,669 --> 01:57:00,826
Come here, Charlie.

1436
01:57:00,858 --> 01:57:02,745
Come here.

1437
01:57:38,748 --> 01:57:40,864
Thank you so much
for bringing us all here together.

1438
01:57:40,896 --> 01:57:44,743
Please look over
all of the dancers tonight and the band.

1439
01:57:44,775 --> 01:57:45,849
And my husband, Jackson.

1440
01:57:45,880 --> 01:57:48,800
We're so excited for him
to be here with us.

1441
01:57:48,831 --> 01:57:50,718
We got a big night.

1442
01:57:50,749 --> 01:57:51,907
We're at the Forum, LA.
Let's do this.

1443
02:00:00,997 --> 02:00:03,844
- Is he here?
- He's not here.

1444
02:00:03,875 --> 02:00:06,899
- He's not here?
- We have to do Shallow regardless, OK?

1445
02:00:06,931 --> 02:00:09,902
The guitar's up there.
Everything's gonna remain the same.

1446
02:00:09,934 --> 02:00:11,039
- What?
- The guitar's up there.

1447
02:00:11,821 --> 02:00:13,927
Everything's gonna remain the same.
Both verses.

1448
02:00:13,958 --> 02:00:17,045
- I'm sure it was just a bit much for him.
- Please send somebody to the house.

1449
02:00:17,826 --> 02:00:19,995
- I'm doing it right now.
- I have 15 seconds.

1450
02:00:50,044 --> 02:00:52,860
Give it up for my husband, Jackson!

1451
02:01:52,010 --> 02:01:53,980
I can stay, if you want.

1452
02:02:18,044 --> 02:02:19,087
Aargh!

1453
02:02:31,193 --> 02:02:35,967
Some kid started singing one of his songs
in a bar I was in the other night.

1454
02:02:39,054 --> 02:02:41,108
They're playing his songs everywhere.

1455
02:02:45,133 --> 02:02:47,124
At first I got angry.

1456
02:02:49,012 --> 02:02:51,107
I don't know why.

1457
02:02:52,067 --> 02:02:54,027
I guess I felt like...

1458
02:02:55,195 --> 02:02:58,166
.."How can any of these people
feel like they knew him?"

1459
02:02:59,083 --> 02:03:01,033
Who he really was.

1460
02:03:04,140 --> 02:03:06,163
But then something changed.

1461
02:03:08,123 --> 02:03:10,125
And it soothed me.

1462
02:03:13,045 --> 02:03:17,027
That it wasn't...
wasn't all for fucking nothing.

1463
02:03:18,018 --> 02:03:20,208
The last thing I did was lie to him.

1464
02:03:23,023 --> 02:03:24,170
Listen to me.

1465
02:03:26,192 --> 02:03:28,132
It isn't your fault.

1466
02:03:30,051 --> 02:03:31,177
It just isn't.

1467
02:03:33,199 --> 02:03:36,036
You know whose fault it was?

1468
02:03:36,067 --> 02:03:37,110
Jack.

1469
02:03:40,049 --> 02:03:41,154
That's it.

1470
02:03:43,063 --> 02:03:44,230
No-one else.

1471
02:03:44,262 --> 02:03:47,067
Not you, not me.

1472
02:03:47,265 --> 02:03:49,079
No-one but Jack.

1473
02:03:49,110 --> 02:03:51,029
I just keep...

1474
02:03:52,051 --> 02:03:55,148
..going over and over it,
over it in my head.

1475
02:03:59,119 --> 02:04:03,259
Jack talked about how music is
essentially 12 notes between any octave.

1476
02:04:07,169 --> 02:04:09,286
12 notes and the octave repeats.

1477
02:04:13,154 --> 02:04:15,125
It's the same story.

1478
02:04:16,168 --> 02:04:18,295
Told over and over.

1479
02:04:19,233 --> 02:04:21,088
Forever.

1480
02:04:22,277 --> 02:04:25,259
All any artist can offer the world...

1481
02:04:25,290 --> 02:04:28,116
is how they see those 12 notes.

1482
02:04:28,147 --> 02:04:30,108
That's it.

1483
02:04:30,295 --> 02:04:32,255
Hm.

1484
02:04:37,146 --> 02:04:39,157
<i>He loved how you see them.</i>

1485
02:04:41,128 --> 02:04:43,120
<i>He just kept saying...</i>

1486
02:04:43,318 --> 02:04:47,113
<i>.."I love how she sees them, Bobby."</i>

1487
02:04:55,225 --> 02:04:58,092
Hello, I'm Ally Maine.

1488
02:05:00,198 --> 02:05:03,326
Thank you for being here tonight
to honour my husband.

1489
02:05:04,108 --> 02:05:05,255
He wrote a song for me.

1490
02:05:06,162 --> 02:05:08,300
I'd like to sing it for him tonight.

1491
02:05:10,229 --> 02:05:12,304
And, with your help, maybe I can.

1492
02:05:14,150 --> 02:05:16,162
Thank you.

1493
02:05:17,132 --> 02:05:18,185
Really.

1494
02:05:19,196 --> 02:05:21,135
Thank you.

1495
02:11:51,662 --> 02:11:53,664
Black Eyes
