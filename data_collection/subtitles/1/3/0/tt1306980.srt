1
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:34,734
So, are you staying over tonight?

2
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:38,234
I'm not sure.

3
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,737
There are a couple of gallery openings
I want to go to.

4
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,739
I'm, like, so nervous about my show.

5
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,579
I mean, I still have two more paintings
that I have to do.

6
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,329
Everything I've been coming up with
is completely derivative

7
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,502
of everything at the Henry.

8
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,080
- Where's my stuff?
- It's in your drawer.

9
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:57,716
I have a drawer?

10
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:00,761
Yeah, I just figured I'd, you know,
put some of your things in.

11
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,178
There wasn't anything in the drawer before.

12
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,347
There was a couple of things
but I moved them into a different one

13
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,470
'cause it made more sense that way.

14
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,223
Honey. We're getting so

15
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,479
domestic.

16
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,073
Good luck with the paintings.

17
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,744
I still have a lot of tooth
paste in my mouth right now.

18
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:28,038
- Have a great day.
- Okay.

19
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,285
- Bye.
- Bye.

20
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:40,964
- Hey.
- Yo!

21
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,925
Sorry I'm late.

22
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,971
- What's that smell? What is that?
- What?

23
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,009
Did you sit in jam or something?

24
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:52,722
- What are you talking about?
- You smell all fruity. Oh!

25
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:56,274
Yeah. I ran out of shampoo.
I had to use Rachael's.

26
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,645
That's great.

27
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,990
You smell like
you fucked the cast of <i>The View.</i>

28
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,738
Are we gonna go?

29
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,366
- Why? You don't want to be late?
- Well, I'm two minutes late already.

30
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,072
- You're already two minutes late.
- I know.

31
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:14,410
But if you really care about that, you should
probably learn to drive. That's what I think.

32
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,539
I deserved that.

33
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,166
You know what's really gonna make us late?

34
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,588
What?

35
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,291
- When I stop for cappuccinos.
- No, no, no, they have coffee there.

36
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,173
- Delicious cappuccinos.
- Dude, seriously.

37
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,384
- Your back still hurts?
- Yeah. I'm going back to the doctor today.

38
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,810
- That's not right, man.
- I know.

39
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,478
Have you been fucking in weird positions?

40
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,977
Of course,
that's where you would go with this.

41
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,648
Sometimes when I fuck in weird positions...

42
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:41,604
I tried froggy style for a while once with
a girl I was dating. Fucked up my back.

43
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,234
I don't even want to ask what that is.

44
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:46,692
It's kind of a doggy style, but like,
you're kind of way higher up...

45
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,699
Actually, Rachael and...
We haven't...

46
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,119
We haven't done it in
like three weeks, dude.

47
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,620
You haven't had sex in three weeks?

48
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,794
Well, she had a yeast infection, and then
she had her period right afterwards.

49
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,418
- Which has got to be done by now.
- You can't fuck with a yeast infection?

50
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:01,874
You can fuck with a yeast infection
or period.

51
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,879
- No. No, it hurts.
- It does?

52
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,461
- Well, that's what she says.
- I think that's bullshit.

53
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,137
No, but I've heard that before
from other girls.

54
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:11,683
Has she been sucking on your dick?
Been giving you blow jobs?

55
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,682
No, she doesn't like to.

56
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,980
She doesn't?
No fucking shit she doesn't like to.

57
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,308
Who likes putting dicks in their mouth?
You do it 'cause...

58
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,482
That's why they're called blow jobs.

59
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,151
- Don't get hysterical.
- It's a job.

60
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,696
I'm not hysterical. I think it is...

61
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:30,406
You... She stays at your house all the time.
She leaves her fucking shit everywhere.

62
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:34,536
You clean it up, you're a nice person.
The least she could do is fellate you.

63
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,992
You put up with a lot of shit
when you're dating a hot girl.

64
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:40,671
Truthfully, that's why, if you recall,
in high school,

65
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,122
I didn't date any hot girls, ever.

66
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,502
- That's why?
- Yes, that's why.

67
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,675
Well, we're not in high school anymore.

68
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:50,256
The relationship that I have with Rachael
is about more than sex.

69
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,433
- What is it about, Adam?
- It's about each other.

70
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,227
You know, we care about each other,
we talk to each other. It's great.

71
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:59,351
Wouldn't it be nice if you could do that,
and then bang the hell out of each other

72
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,431
- afterwards?
- Ideally, yes.

73
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:04,065
But it's not a perfect world, okay?
Can you hurry up, please?

74
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:07,405
Just gotta tie my shoe.

75
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,608
Good morning, Jenny.
Hey. How's it going?

76
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,536
Are you on the phone? I'll be quiet.

77
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,830
That's so gross, man. It's disgusting.
You shouldn't do that.

78
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,035
Hey, Kyle, Adam.

79
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,712
- Hey, Phil.
- Sorry we're late.

80
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:26,166
Look at that, you are late. Don't do that.

81
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,752
I wanted to talk to you
about the volcano piece.

82
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,759
It's coming along really well. I've got
all the research and interviews done.

83
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,556
- Great.
- But the narration

84
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,224
is turning into a bit of a problem.

85
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,428
Whoever did it, he kept clearing his throat.

86
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,855
And he doesn't take a pause, he just keeps
talking. And if there was a pause

87
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,227
I could cut around it. But...

88
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,354
- Cool?
- Grab that.

89
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:44,981
- Okay.
- So I'm just gonna...

90
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,150
It's like he doesn't care.

91
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,529
No, it's like we gotta put shit
on the radio every single day.

92
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,204
And it's pointless to spend months
working on something

93
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,123
that someone's gona hear for two seconds
while they're stopped at a red light.

94
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,871
Well, I like it when it's good radio.

95
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,998
Yeah, well, good luck with that.

96
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,671
You're in Wales? You're in Wales?

97
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,838
So does that make you Welsh, or Wale-ish?

98
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,762
I never know which one's which.

99
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,305
Okay, yeah. World music.

100
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:17,930
Can you hear me? Your voice sounds weird.
You sound like a robot.

101
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,431
Do I sound like a robot?

102
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,932
Does it sound weird to you?

103
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,389
You have to be quieter. I'm trying to...

104
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:25,521
I said you sound like a robot to me.

105
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,900
Wait, go back. Go back. It's unbelievable.
I know.

106
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,605
See, I don't know
what world music is either.

107
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,940
That's what's so weird about it.

108
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,070
"It's unbelievable. I know.

109
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:36,995
"I know. What is world music, anyway?
I'm such a fucking asshole.

110
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,494
"I'm the king of the fucking world.
Suck my dick.

111
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:42,417
"My friend Adam hasn't had his dick
sucked in six fucking months."

112
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,779
- How are you?
- Hi.

113
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,377
The patient has been complaining
of back pain and night sweats.

114
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,171
Blood tests and urine analysis are normal.

115
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,170
MRI suggests
a massive intradural malignant

116
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,923
schwannoma neurofibrosarcoma
extending in the psoas muscle

117
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,972
with nerve root compression syndrome
and bone erosion.

118
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:41,597
The growth extends from L2 to L5.
Will send patient for biopsy to confirm.

119
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,222
Yes, question?

120
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:49,525
Sorry, I just didn't follow that.
Is there something wrong with me?

121
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:53,321
Yes. Well, if you look here on your MRI,

122
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:58,323
you see this cephalopod-like object
that's spreading down your spinal column.

123
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:01,075
That is a massive
schwannoma neurofibrosarcoma.

124
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,451
Okay.

125
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,369
- So sorry. I just don't know what that...
- It's a malignant tumor.

126
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,166
- A tumor?
- Yes.

127
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,630
- Me?
- Yes.

128
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:15,427
That doesn't make any sense though.

129
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,550
I mean, I don't smoke. I don't drink.
I... You know. I recycle.

130
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:21,474
Actually, your case
is really quite fascinating because

131
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:25,645
your cancer is the result of an incredibly
rare gene mutation in chromosome 17,

132
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,940
the P53 gene that causes
the growth of malignant cells...

133
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:43,071
I think that given the placement and size
of your particular tumor,

134
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:47,079
the wisest course of action is to see
if we can possibly reduce this thing

135
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,128
down to a more manageable size
before we consider surgery.

136
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:54,591
Now, chemotherapy can often result
in fertility issues.

137
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,963
But I'm gonna be okay?

138
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,511
If you need someone to talk to,

139
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,846
we have an excellent staff here
at the hospital

140
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,769
of social workers and psychologists.

141
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,814
They specialize in these matters,
and they would be able to help you.

142
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,850
Now as I said, you should consider...

143
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,220
<i>Two jumps in a week</i>

144
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:46,677
<i>I bet you think that's pretty clever,</i>
<i>don't you, boy?</i>

145
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:53,148
<i>Flying on your motorcycle</i>

146
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:56,979
<i>Watching all the ground beneath you drop</i>

147
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:04,114
<i>You'd kill yourself for recognition</i>

148
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:08,323
<i>Kill yourself to never, ever stop</i>

149
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,836
Oh, Adam.

150
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:17,165
Listen, I'm not expecting you
to take this on.

151
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,125
I mean,
it's not like we're married or anything.

152
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:24,305
So, you know, if you have to bail,
then you should. No hard feelings.

153
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:28,726
Not that I want you do.
I hope that you don't.

154
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,304
I'm not gonna bail on you, Adam.

155
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,020
I'm here for you.

156
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:37,527
Okay?

157
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,197
Thank you.

158
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,652
It's gonna be okay.

159
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,708
Yeah. It'll be okay. All right?

160
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,126
- I'm gonna throw up.
- Don't throw up. You're gonna be fine.

161
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,209
- I actually think I might throw up.
- You're not gonna throw up.

162
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,794
No, open your eyes.
Look at me, look at me.

163
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,550
- Okay.
- All right?

164
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,719
What kind of cancer is it?
What's the name of the cancer?

165
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,722
- Some rare kind of cancer.
- What's it called?

166
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,804
Schwannoma... I knew this.

167
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,515
- Schwannoma? It's schwannoma?
- Schwannoma...

168
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,601
- What's schwannoma?
- That means tumor, basically.

169
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,231
Do you have a picture of it, at least?
Can I see it?

170
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:20,402
Why would I have a picture of it?

171
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,698
It's common practice
to fucking get pictures of shit now.

172
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:26,071
But that's like the Internet, so...

173
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:29,120
- It's not a picture of anything.
- Are you gonna be okay?

174
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:30,242
- I think so.
- What are your chances?

175
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,869
- What are your odds?
- I don't know.

176
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,575
I looked it up and it said 50/50.

177
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,252
But that's like the Internet, so...

178
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,463
That's not that bad.

179
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:42,254
That's better than I thought.
You're gonna be fine, man.

180
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,381
You're young.
Young people beat cancer all the time.

181
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,962
Every celebrity beats cancer.

182
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:48,673
Fucking Lance Armstrong,
he keeps getting it.

183
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,258
- Yeah.
- He's fine.

184
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,685
- Yeah.
- The guy from <i>Dexter?</i> He's okay.

185
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,763
Patrick Swayze? He's fine.

186
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,314
- Patrick Swayze?
- And he's older.

187
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,518
Yeah, but, dude, that guy's dead.

188
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,525
- Really?
- Yeah.

189
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,696
That's really fucked up. I didn't know that.

190
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,873
Don't even think about him, okay?
Don't worry about that.

191
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,576
- You got to look at the bright side here.
- Bright side? Of what?

192
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,501
You're gonna be fine.
What did your parents say?

193
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,711
Did they freak out? Your mother?

194
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,918
I'm not gonna tell her.

195
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,423
You're not gonna tell her?
You gotta tell her.

196
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,379
She'll probably deal with it better
than most people.

197
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,714
Your dad has Alzheimer's, you know.

198
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,424
- She's used to dealing with tragedy.
- But you know her.

199
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,134
- She loses her fucking...
- Obviously you have to tell her.

200
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,890
I'm gonna tell her.

201
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:38,519
- You're gonna be fine.
- Yeah.

202
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,645
You're gonna be fine. 50/50!

203
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:43,695
If you were a casino game,
you would have the best odds.

204
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,567
Yeah, thanks.

205
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,774
- Okay. Let's get to work.
- You don't want coffee?

206
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:49,359
I'm awake now.

207
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,788
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, honey.

208
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,165
Hi, Dad.

209
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,540
- Hi, I'm Richard.
- Adam.

210
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,042
This is Adam, your son. Remember?

211
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:04,583
Adam.

212
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,004
Hi!

213
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,345
So, what's the big news?
Is Rachael pregnant?

214
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:11,514
Mom, no. I'll tell you, okay?

215
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:14,263
Okay, okay. I know you use protection.

216
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,436
- Wow, you need to do something about this.
- What?

217
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,936
- Well, call the landlord, the paint's peeling.
- It's fine.

218
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,985
- Give me his number, I'll call him.
- Okay.

219
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,062
- Hi.
- Hi.

220
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,532
- That's new.
- Yeah. Rachael made it.

221
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,951
- It's called <i>Oppression.</i>
- No, it's <i>Liberation.</i>

222
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,450
That's right, that one's <i>Liberation.</i>

223
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,405
<i>Oppression</i> is in the bathroom.

224
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,288
- Nice.
- Thank you.

225
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,455
Sweetheart, your pills.

226
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,129
There you go.

227
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:54,637
So, what's the special occasion?

228
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:59,304
I want to tell you something, but...

229
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:05,109
I just need you to promise me
you're gonna stay calm.

230
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,061
Adam, don't be so overdramatic.

231
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:10,523
- Mom, just promise, okay?
- Okay, I promise.

232
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,485
You always make me out to be
some irrational loon.

233
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,945
Okay.

234
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,249
- Have you ever seen <i>Terms of Endearment?</i>
- Mmm-hmm.

235
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,002
Jesus, Adam. Just tell her.

236
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,549
Tell me what?

237
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,296
I have cancer.

238
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,259
What do you mean you have cancer?

239
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:42,393
I have cancer.
What do you want me to say?

240
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,772
When did this happen?

241
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,941
A couple of days ago.

242
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,863
A couple of days ago?

243
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:55,155
You waited a couple of days to tell me?

244
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,495
I'm sorry. You're right.

245
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,658
Honey.

246
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:09,298
- I'm moving in.
- What? No. No, Mom. No.

247
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:12,127
- I'm your mother, Adam.
- No! Exactly. That's why.

248
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,462
And look, you already have enough
on your plate with him.

249
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,343
Who's gonna take you
to your appointments?

250
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:19,346
You don't even drive a car.
Who's gonna look after you?

251
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,226
Me.

252
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,609
I'm going to take care of him.

253
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,944
Mom. Mom! Mom!

254
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,331
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna make you some green tea.

255
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,626
Can you just come back? Come sit down.

256
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:50,628
I heard on the <i>Today</i> show that
it reduces your risk of cancer by 15%.

257
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,386
Well, I already have cancer.

258
00:16:55,473 --> 00:17:01,389
So, can you just please come
and sit down. Okay?

259
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:14,947
- Hi, I'm looking for Dr. McKay.
- Second door down there.

260
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:33,624
Come in!

261
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,137
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

262
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,886
I'm supposed to have an appointment
with Dr. McKay?

263
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:42,887
Oh!

264
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,344
Sorry.

265
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:49,558
Please come in
and please call me Katherine. Hi.

266
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:52,064
- You're Dr. McKay.
- I am. Uh...

267
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,104
Well, have a seat. Sit down, please.

268
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,736
Sorry about this guy.

269
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,122
- You're Adam.
- Yeah.

270
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:08,872
And aren't you supposed to be wearing
an earth-toned sweater

271
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:11,454
and be like 65 or something?

272
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:12,755
Did someone say I looked like that?

273
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:18,257
No, no, no. I'm just... Sorry.
If you don't mind, how old are you?

274
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,301
- Twenty-four.
- You're 24. Wow!

275
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:23,758
So, what, are you like Doogie Howser
or something?

276
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,176
Who?

277
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,847
Doogie Howser? Teenage doctor.

278
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:31,728
- Does he work here?
- No, no.

279
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,686
I just meant you seem a little young
to be a doctor.

280
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:39,194
Technically I'm not a doctor yet.
I'm actually working on my doctorate.

281
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:42,448
- Okay.
- Yeah, this is a training hospital.

282
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:46,781
I see. So have you had very many patients?

283
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,701
My patient history is not...

284
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,333
- I'm your first patient, aren't I?
- No.

285
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,963
- No?
- No, not at all.

286
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,632
- Second?
- No.

287
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:57,879
Third?

288
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:04,469
Wow, okay, third.
How are the first two doing?

289
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:08,644
- Can't talk about that.
- Right.

290
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,848
So this is training for you?

291
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,603
It will be part of my dissertation.

292
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,643
Oh, so you write about all of this?

293
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,820
Don't worry, I don't use your real name.

294
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,906
Okay. That's fine.

295
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,194
Well, Dr. Ross

296
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:30,249
filled me in on your situation.

297
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:31,416
Yeah.

298
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:35,959
This must be incredibly difficult
that all this...

299
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:40,339
- How do you feel right now?
- Fine. Yeah, I feel...

300
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:45,180
I can't remember being so calm
in a long time.

301
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:48,600
That's a really common symptom
in patients like yourself.

302
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:53,057
Actually your body is in survival mode,
so what you're experiencing is shock.

303
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,017
What? I think I'm actually just fine.

304
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:59,445
Right, but that's why you're feeling
the sense of calm.

305
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:03,024
Would you describe what you're feeling
as a kind of numbness?

306
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,199
No, I'd describe it as fine.

307
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,119
- Because certain patients feel like...
- I feel great.

308
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:12,867
Well, that's wonderful.

309
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,039
- I think that's wonderful.
- Thanks.

310
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:19,837
If it's okay with you, I think maybe today

311
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:23,545
we'll just start with some
simple relaxation exercises.

312
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,051
- I am relaxed.
- I know you are.

313
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,131
Um...

314
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:32,095
But just humor me?

315
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,895
If you want to lie down.

316
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,644
- Lie down?
- Yeah.

317
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:49,862
Okay.

318
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:55,376
And close your eyes.

319
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,623
Really?

320
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,125
Yeah.

321
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,128
For this to work,
you're gonna have to trust me.

322
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,631
Yeah. They're closed.

323
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,841
Okay.

324
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:15,433
<i>No peeking,</i>
<i>keep your eyes closed.</i>

325
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:19,271
Okay, open your eyes.

326
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,612
Surprise!

327
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:28,242
His name is Skeletor.
He's a retired race dog.

328
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,035
You got me an old dog?

329
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,329
Well, he's not that old.

330
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,702
He's old enough to be retired.

331
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:37,827
Having a dog helps
with the healing process.

332
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:39,787
What, does he have a medical license?

333
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:43,666
Okay, forget it. I can just bring
him back to the shelter in the morning.

334
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:45,376
Well, then what happens to him?

335
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:48,508
He will be put back in his tiny cage
with 10 other dogs

336
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:51,716
who will bully and rape him
until he's eventually euthanized.

337
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:56,729
Okay, fine, I'll keep the dog.

338
00:21:58,192 --> 00:21:59,728
- Really?
- Yeah.

339
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,944
This is gonna be so good for you.
I promise.

340
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,159
This whole party was my idea.

341
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:14,535
I thought maybe we could just,
you know, celebrate his life.

342
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:19,502
I mean, he's gonna be better. Right?
It's not like he...

343
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:25,003
I hope so. But, you know, I just...
I'm not even thinking about that.

344
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:29,804
Tonight I thought it was best not to think
about whether he gets better or doesn't.

345
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,098
I just thought we should celebrate
the Adam that we all know and love.

346
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:34,683
Have you started chemo yet?

347
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:37,015
So, what kind of cancer you got?

348
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,062
You want to know the secret
to beating this thing?

349
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,764
My uncle had what you have.

350
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:56,789
I like to get touched when I cry.
I don't know about you.

351
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,199
I'm gonna miss you so much.

352
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,627
I'm gonna miss you too, Phil.

353
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:05,873
Hey, Phil.

354
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:07,299
Yeah, buddy?

355
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:12,050
You know, I want you to know I'm still
gonna finish that Mount Moa Moa story.

356
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:15,008
You take as much time as you need.
I can't wait to hear that.

357
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,137
Thanks.

358
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:24,066
You know, I just wanted to say that

359
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:26,978
you've been really great
these last couple of weeks.

360
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:31,611
And then today making me breakfast
and coming with me. It's just really great.

361
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:34,614
- Thanks for saying that.
- Thank you.

362
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,492
Oh, Adam.

363
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:45,538
- Are you coming?
- If it's cool, could I just wait here?

364
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:49,508
- Well, you know it's like four hours, right?
- Yeah, yeah, no, I know.

365
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,298
So you're just gonna sit here
for four hours?

366
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:58,392
Honey, I don't want to mix that world

367
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,178
and, you know, this world.

368
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:05,687
It's like an energy thing. You know?

369
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,695
Okay. All right.

370
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,037
Good luck.

371
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:28,213
- Adam Lerner?
- Yep.

372
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:42,678
<i>Oh, I'm all alone</i>

373
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,515
This way, my baby.

374
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:54,615
<i>I know you're still listening to me</i>

375
00:24:56,245 --> 00:25:00,830
<i>Isn't a lot as far as I see</i>

376
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:12,583
You want a macaroon?

377
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,297
Oh, thanks. I'm all right.

378
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,431
There's weed in them.

379
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:21,883
Oh.

380
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:28,475
Yeah, thank you. But I don't do weed.

381
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:30,727
Come on, man, just get high with us.

382
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,188
Okay.

383
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,273
- Thanks.
- Sure.

384
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,651
Hey.

385
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:42,155
- How old are you?
- I'm 27.

386
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:45,912
That's the worst.
What a waste of a perfectly good youth.

387
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:47,709
Don't listen to him.
He's just messing with you.

388
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:51,914
No, no, you listen to me.
You know, this cancer is bullshit.

389
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:54,716
See, first, all your hair falls out.

390
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,543
Then your balls are gonna shrink.

391
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,469
And then to make matters worse,

392
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,882
your dick becomes a constant source
of disappointment.

393
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:05,060
You know, I was kind of scared
about this whole cancer thing.

394
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:08,105
But now I've met you guys
and, boy, do I feel better.

395
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:09,477
Thank you.

396
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:17,940
I'm Alan Lombardo, stage three lymphoma.
Pleased to meet you.

397
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:20,742
Mitch Barnett, metastatic prostate cancer.

398
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,535
Nice to meet you.

399
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:28,159
Oh, I'm Adam Lerner,
schwannoma neurofibrosarcoma.

400
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,418
Whoo! What the fuck is that?

401
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:32,584
Tough break.

402
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:35,962
The more syllables, the worse it is.

403
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:41,593
- These are really good.
- Yeah, my wife made them.

404
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:43,673
Are they, uh...

405
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,472
How strong are they?

406
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,766
Stee-rong.

407
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,487
<i>There's a light</i>

408
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:06,242
<i>A certain kind of light</i>

409
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:09,784
<i>That never shone on me</i>

410
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:17,667
<i>I want my life to be lived with you</i>

411
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,460
<i>Lived with you</i>

412
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:26,718
<i>There's a way</i>
<i>Everybody say</i>

413
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:31,267
<i>To do each and every little thing</i>

414
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:36,018
<i>But what does it bring</i>

415
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,399
<i>If I ain't got you?</i>

416
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,572
<i>Ain't got</i>

417
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:45,828
<i>Baby, you don't know what it's like</i>

418
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:50,115
<i>Baby, you don't know what it's like</i>

419
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,410
<i>To love somebody</i>

420
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:56,129
<i>To love somebody</i>

421
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,166
<i>The way I love you</i>

422
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:03,296
<i>Oh, no, no</i>

423
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,052
<i>You don't know what it's like</i>

424
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:09,973
<i>Baby, you don't know...</i>

425
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,625
Adam, are you okay?

426
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:46,464
So, how are you feeling,
after your first chemo?

427
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:50,267
It feels pretty bad, I gotta say.

428
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,016
My head hurts right now.

429
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,605
Yeah.

430
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:59,105
From what I understand, it's really rough.

431
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:03,356
Um... But it will pass.

432
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:06,816
Mmm.

433
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,997
I think it's important to remember that
these side effects are completely normal.

434
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,284
Well, that's good. I would hate to feel
special in some kind of way.

435
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,585
I'm sensing some anger, which is good.

436
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:19,163
I'm not angry.

437
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:24,001
Why would that be good?

438
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,587
Because you're expressing yourself.

439
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:30,516
You're dealing with a really serious illness

440
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:33,643
and it brings up a lot of emotions.

441
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:38,144
So you're trying to make me freak out
or something, right? Is that the goal here?

442
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,526
I'm not trying to make you freak out.

443
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:44,939
I do want you to get in touch with
what you're feeling inside.

444
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:48,025
- So, if you're angry...
- I'm not angry! Okay?

445
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:51,236
Let's just do the relaxation things, okay?

446
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,868
Can we do that? I want to hear sitars,

447
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,242
and go to my happy place
and feel the warm beam of light.

448
00:29:57,421 --> 00:30:00,037
- Can we do that?
- I see.

449
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:08,717
I'm sorry. I'm just being an asshole.

450
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,547
I didn't need to say that.

451
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,553
I don't need you to take care of me.

452
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,061
I'm trying to take care of you.

453
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:19,181
You're right.

454
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:25,150
Listen, there are a couple of books
I want you to check out.

455
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,027
A lot of people find them really helpful.

456
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:32,736
You don't have to read them cover-to-cover.

457
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:36,039
Just take a look
and see if anything resonates.

458
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:37,241
- Okay?
- Okay.

459
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:45,674
Sorry. Are you gonna, like,
keep touching me like that?

460
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:47,251
- This?
- Yeah.

461
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,085
I'm, uh...

462
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,796
I'm trying to make you feel more at ease.

463
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:56,010
That's gonna make me feel more at ease?
It's like being slapped by a sea otter.

464
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,935
Touching promotes trust.
It's one of the key ways

465
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:00,765
that hospital practitioners
make their patients

466
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,224
feel more secure in stressful situations.

467
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:05,561
Yeah, but it's just...
That's not gonna help.

468
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,111
Really? A sea otter?

469
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:10,032
Is this... Is that kind of better?

470
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,860
- Okay, this is getting creepy.
- I'm sorry.

471
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:15,445
Okay, you don't like that. That's fine.

472
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:17,034
You shouldn't do this.
You're making a mistake.

473
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,365
You're gonna look weird, man.

474
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,700
- What do you mean?
- It's gonna look fucking weird.

475
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:21,035
What are you talking about?

476
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:24,713
Who knows if you've got some big
Gorbachev bird shit thing on your head.

477
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,587
- You said that you liked this idea.
- I liked the idea in theory.

478
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,008
Now that we're standing here
about to do it,

479
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:32,008
I think you're gonna look like fucking
Michael Stipe or something.

480
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:33,589
- We have to do it.
- I'm not doing it, man.

481
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,344
- We have to do it.
- You do it. I'm not fucking doing it.

482
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,515
- Come on. Do it.
- No way.

483
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,718
- You said you would.
- I don't want to,

484
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,178
'cause if it looks fucked up
you're gonna blame me

485
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,228
every time you look
at your weird-looking bald head.

486
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,852
What? Wait a minute.

487
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:47,478
What do you use this for?

488
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,691
You know, my body hair.

489
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,536
When was the last time you cleaned this?

490
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,243
Like brand new.

491
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,332
- That's great.
- Totally clean.

492
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:05,129
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

493
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:10,630
Oh, fuck. Dude.

494
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:12,844
Holy shit.

495
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,178
Cut that part off.

496
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,981
- Shit.
- You want to do one?

497
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:28,856
Yeah, can I? Okay, I'm gonna do it.

498
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,741
I don't want to do it anymore.

499
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,410
You kinda got a Klingon thing
going on here.

500
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:40,034
You could pass for Worf
from <i>Star Trek.</i>

501
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,956
- Looks totally good.
- It's totally uneven.

502
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,078
Totally normal.

503
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:45,252
Is this attached? Jesus Christ.

504
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:47,454
Looks okay, right?

505
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,419
No, looks really weird.

506
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,125
- We shouldn't have done this.
- Yeah, big mistake.

507
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,505
Why didn't we go to a barber?

508
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:55,883
That would have been a good idea.
If we paid someone to do it.

509
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:59,091
Using your fucking balls trimmer
instead of going to the barber.

510
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:03,099
I never wash them, ever.
And it's not my balls, it's my asshole.

511
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,896
- I'm joking.
- You're not joking.

512
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,644
Not at all.

513
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,738
- How come we've never met Rachael?
- Yeah, what the fuck?

514
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:20,863
Yeah, hospitals kind of freak her out, so...

515
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,164
Hmm.

516
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,491
What?

517
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,952
Well, Adam,
nobody likes going to the hospital.

518
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:29,288
That's not why people go.

519
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:34,877
No, no, you don't get it. it's like she doesn't
want to mix the negative and the positive.

520
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,836
It's an energy thing.

521
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,431
Sounds to me like a bullshit thing.

522
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:43,894
Well, you can meet her if you want.
She's gonna pick me up right after this.

523
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,596
If you want to meet her.
I'm sure she would love to meet you guys.

524
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:47,771
Sure.

525
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:51,644
She's really great.
You guys are gonna like her a lot.

526
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:52,818
Okay.

527
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:58,696
Hey, it's me again.
Just calling to check if you're close.

528
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:02,028
I'll talk to you soon. Okay. See you.

529
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:05,240
So you need a ride, kid?

530
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:08,919
Oh, no, she's gonna come.
I'm sure she is just hung up or something.

531
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:12,998
You guys should probably go, though.
You could meet her next time.

532
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,127
Yeah, sure.

533
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,629
- See you, Adam.
- See you.

534
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:52,667
Adam, I know. I'm sorry.
Please don't be mad.

535
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:55,798
I was calling you for like an hour.

536
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:58,001
Yeah, my cell phone died.

537
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,136
You know, you don't have to do this.

538
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,842
I'm sorry, I am. I know I fucked up.

539
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,472
I gave you an out.

540
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:10,143
I'm doing my best.

541
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,223
Can we just go home?

542
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,533

545

Mystic psychiatrist?

546
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:38,383
What is that? Is he Frodo's psychiatrist?
Why would you buy that?

547
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:41,303
Because the therapist lady said to buy it.

548
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,755
So, I don't know,
what else am I gonna do?

549
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,934
- Let's go to Mardi Gras.
- I have a girlfriend.

550
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:50,933
Why would I go to Mardi Gras?

551
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:53,811
You have a girlfriend. Yeah, I forgot.
Why would you go to Mardi Gras

when you're busy here
not getting blow jobs and hand jobs?

553

You know what? If you're not
gonna take advantage of this then I am.

554
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:13,994
- Hi, Claire. Hi. I'm Kyle.
- Hi.

555
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:16,838
Could you help me find
some of these, please?

556
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:18,335
Yeah. Sure.

557
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,843
Are these for you? I'm sorry,

558
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:27,425
- that's really none of my business.
- No. Don't worry. No, thank God.

559
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,472
They're actually for my friend.
That guy over there.

560
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,019
- That little guy in the hat.
- Yeah.

561
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:34,940
They're for him. He's my buddy.
He's really, really sick.

562
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:36,854
That's awful.

563
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:39,687
He's got type four back cancer, and...

564
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:41,396
- Oh, no. Really?
- I know, yeah.

565
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:42,571
- It's really sad.
- Poor guy.

566
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:46,652
I don't focus on that. I focus on the
positive. I take him out to bookstores.

567
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:49,954
I like to take him for walks.
I take him out to get snacks and

568
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:53,204
to plays, stuff like
that, while he has time.

569
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:54,625
That's nice of you.

570
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:58,667
- Yeah. So where are...
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.

571
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:01,670
- They're just over this way.
- No problem. Yeah.

572
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:02,750
- All right, there you are.
- Thank you.

573
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:04,552
- Thank you. Bye.
- Bye.

574
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,719
- I'll see you tonight.
- Okay.

575
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:09,550
Bye, Claire. Nice to meet you, Claire.
Thank you, Claire.

576
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:35,618
- Hi, Mom.
- <i>Jesus, what took you so long to pick up?</i>

577
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:38,499
- <i>Are you okay?</i>
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

578
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:42,424
I just didn't hear the phone ring.

579
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,593
<i>Do you need anything?</i>
<i>I was about to go to Rite Aid for your father</i>

580
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,671
<i>Listen, I'll come over.</i>
<i>I'll make you some dinner.</i>

581
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:51,258
<i>I'll pick up some macaroni and cheese.</i>

582
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:54,139
I haven't liked macaroni and cheese
since I was like ten.

583
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:58,564
- <i>You haven't?</i>
- Actually Rachael's coming over later.

584
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:02,018
So, I'm totally fine. Don't worry so much.

585
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,276
<i>Fine, if you say so. I love you.</i>

586
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,651
Love you.

587
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:17,038
Hi.

588
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:20,958
Oh, this one's really cool.

589
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,581
- Look at that.
- My friend did this actually.

590
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:24,665
- No way.
- Yeah.

591
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:27,753
- Your friend's a real talent.
- I know.

592
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,087
Uh-oh.

593
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:31,264
I think I got a new favorite.

594
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:32,511
That's so amazing.

595
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:37,137
It's like a circle,
but then they add a line in the middle.

596
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:39,894
And that totally sets it off.
It's like totally different.

597
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,724
- Yeah. Simple.
- Holy shit, there's two of them.

598
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:44,235
What the fuck?

599
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,276
So what do you think about this one?

600
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:48,731
Oh.

601
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:52,489
This is genius.

602
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:57,324
I mean, I'm having like
an emotional thing going on.

603
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,374
It's fucking gorgeous.

604
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:01,707
It's... You know, it's beautiful.

605
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:05,582
Oh, my God, I should've known
I would see her here.

606
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:08,835
- It's a fucking gallery opening, right?
- Who is she?

607
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,262
You know my friend,
the one who's sick with cancer?

608
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:14,098
That's his girlfriend.

609
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,846
I'm gonna go get some wine.

610
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,928
She doesn't really look like
she's anyone's girlfriend.

611
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:22,933
No fucking way. No fucking way.

612
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:25,439
Oh!

613
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,693
I fucking nailed that cunt.
Can you believe that?

614
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,023
Oh, God.

615
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,443
I don't usually say that.

616
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:49,171
Hi.

617
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:52,595
I'm sorry.

618
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:55,390
I didn't want to wake you.

619
00:39:58,605 --> 00:39:59,936
Come here.

620
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:04,979
I'm just... I'm so tired.
Let's just go to bed, okay?

621
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:07,064
Yeah.

622
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:12,403
- Hey.
- Oh, my God!

623
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:14,484
Surprise, it's Kyle.

624
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,319
- What's happening, guys?
- Hi, Kyle.

625
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,494
What time is it?

626
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,618
Did I come at a bad time?
Am I interrupting something?

627
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:21,992
We were just about to go to bed.

628
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:26,083
I'm sorry. I was in the neighborhood.
I was just on a date.

629
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:28,085
Claire, the girl I met at the bookstore?

630
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:31,259
My date did not go well, unfortunately,

631
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:35,510
due to a lack of chemistry and, I think,
an overuse of profanity on my part.

632
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,012
But whilst on my date,

633
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:41,393
- I ran into Rachael.
- Oh, yeah?

634
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:45,770
And I would like to present to you
what I have grown to call

635
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:49,019
exhibit whore!

636
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,899
Look at it! That's Rachael.

637
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,153
And that's a fucking filthy
Jesus-looking motherfucker!

638
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:58,156
And they're kissing! I did it!
I fucking nailed you!

639
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,953
I've hated you for months!

640
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:03,954
And now I have fucking evidence
that you suck as a person!

641
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:06,832
Holy shit! Holy shit!

642
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,127
Nothing? Nothing?

643
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,513
Okay. You guys should talk about this.

644
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:19,890
What? Were you cheating on me?

645
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,344
Listen...

646
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:28,315
- Yes.
- Seriously?

647
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:29,609
Adam...

648
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,364
You have no idea how hard it's been.

649
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:37,612
I don't know how to do this.

650
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:43,327
This has been so stressful,
and you've been so sick.

651
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:46,785
And shit! Okay, you know what?
Kyle is the one

652
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:49,086
who has been using your cancer for girls.
All right?

653
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:52,711
You told me that. All right?
So why am I the bad guy?

654
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:54,508
Because you're his girlfriend,
you cheated on him.

655
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,756
He has fucking cancer, you lunatic!

656
00:41:56,848 --> 00:42:00,466
Okay, Adam, we had problems
long before you got sick.

657
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:05,099
And then when you got sick,
I just didn't know what to do.

658
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:11,477
Well, then...

659
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:17,862
Why are you here then?
Why do you spend every night in my bed?

660
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:20,910
I didn't want to abandon you.

661
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:25,907
Let's just go to bed.

662
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,539
And we will talk about this tomorrow.
All right? I'm sorry.

663
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,838
I can't stand in the kitchen
and listen to this bullshit any longer.

664
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,132
You gotta get out of here.
This is crazy!

665
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:37,256
- You're so weird.
- Adam...

666
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:39,553
This is the most uncomfortable
situation ever!

667
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,629
- Just leave!
- Yeah.

668
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,807
- And then we're gonna talk tomorrow.
- Get up!

669
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:44,850
No, you won't!
Why will you talk tomorrow?

670
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:47,223
- I care about you, Adam. All right?
- This is disgusting.

671
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:49,522
- It's not like this.
- You are reprehensible.

672
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:51,019
- That's what this behavior is.
- Shut up for a second.

673
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:53,438
Kyle does not have your best interests
in mind.

674
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:55,895
All right?
I've thought that for a very long time.

675
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,901
- I didn't fuck a filthy bearded hippy.
- I want you to know that.

676
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,108
- I didn't make out with a disgusting hippy.
- I care about you.

677
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:02,034
- Fuck you!
- You're disgusting.

678
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,704
This is the best thing
that has ever happened to you.

679
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:56,630
- Why?
- Why?

680
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:59,208
You deserve better. Way better.

681
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,294
If I was your girlfriend,
you know what I would be doing?

682
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:03,050
I'd be sucking your cock every
thirty minutes.

683
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:05,177
I'd be baking you fucking cookies all day
and shit.

684
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:07,054
- What kind of cookies?
- Any kind.

685
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:09,347
You'd make me snickerdoodle cookies?

686
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,929
I'd bathe you in snickerdoodle cookies.

687
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:14,015
- I'm getting nauseous.
- Actually?

688
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:15,566
No, that was a joke.

689
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,189
- Hi.
- Oh! Look at this guy.

690
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,489
I love greyhounds. Hi. What's his name?

691
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:23,112
Skeletor.

692
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:26,694
- This is Marlow.
- Marlow! Hello, Marlow! Look at this guy.

693
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:29,830
- Do you guys live around here?
- Yeah, we sure do.

694
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,407
He's licking his balls.

695
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:35,912
- That was awesome.
- That was wonderful.

696
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,417
Yeah, we should probably go.
He gets cold

697
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:38,665
- when he's not moving.
- Yeah, okay.

698
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,169
- Right.
- Nice to meet you.

699
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,217
Okay. Okay. Nice to meet you.

700
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:45,047
- Bye. Nice to meet you.
- Come on.

701
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:47,006
You could've fucked the shit
out of that girl. You know that?

702
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,511
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about?

703
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:51,766
No one wants to fuck me.
I look like Voldemort.

704
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:55,105
No, you don't.

705
00:44:56,694 --> 00:45:01,028
It doesn't matter, man. Seriously.
You just invite her out on a doggy date,

706
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:03,489
tell her you have cancer,
and fuck the shit out of her.

707
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:06,192
You really think that a girl's gonna
go for me just 'cause I have cancer?

708
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:09,529
For the millionth time, yes!
You're fucking single now.

709
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:12,411
Dude, help me help you get laid.

710
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,958
- You think that would work?
- It would totally work.

711
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:18,833
All right, let's do it.

712
00:45:18,925 --> 00:45:22,088
Lots of hot girls!
Good odds tonight. Lots!

713
00:45:22,178 --> 00:45:23,668
- Okay, right there.
- Yep. All right.

714
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:27,676
Blue shirt. Go for it.
Just talk, spark up a conversation.

715
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:29,803
Hey, how's it going?

716
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,813
Okay, you know what I would do?

717
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:38,979
Get into the cancer thing faster.

718
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,480
- Faster?
- Faster.

719
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:41,902
- She didn't say anything.
- I know,

720
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,071
but it's your hook, man. It's what you got.
You know?

721
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:47,241
So, what, that's the first thing I say?
Just like, "Hello, I have cancer."

722
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:49,114
That's what makes you different.
It's what sets you apart.

723
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:51,366
- You know, you're sympathetic.
- Okay. Okay.

724
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:52,697
- Just try it.
- Okay.

725
00:45:58,214 --> 00:45:59,954
- It's a great song.
- Totally.

726
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:01,539
I have cancer.

727
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,500
I was wrong. I was wrong. It was weird.

728
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,381
- It's weird like that.
- That's too soon.

729
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:07,552
- It doesn't sound cool.
- No.

730
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,255
I'm Kyle. How's it going?

731
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:11,306
- Allison. This is Jackie.
- Allison? Jackie.

732
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:12,850
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you guys.

733
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:15,223
- It's my birthday today!
- Happy birthday!

734
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:18,514
Cheers!

735
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:22,110
- I'm here with my buddy, actually.
- The skinny one?

736
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:24,357
- One second.
- Yeah.

737
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:28,115
Look, I met two nice girls.
They're right there.

738
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:29,487
- Yeah, they're cute.
- Yeah, let's go over.

739
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:30,658
- Are they nice?
- They're very nice.

740
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,282
- They're talking to you?
- Yeah.

741
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:33,613
- Really?
- Take the hat off.

742
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:35,699
- Take it off. Take it off.
- I'm not taking it off.

743
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:37,620
What do you guys do?

744
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:39,748
I just designed the website for the Swiffer.

745
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,454
- The Swiffer? Really?
- Yeah.

746
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:45,588
Sorry, I got excited. I'm a fan. I
kike Swiffer. I use it for everything.

747
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:47,885
Mopping and sweeping.

748
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,968
I just got a dog and he sheds a lot.

749
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:56,519
And when there's hair all over the place
I just use a wet cloth. Taken care of.

750
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,187
That's cool. What's your dog's name?

751
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:02,642
His name is Skeletor. Cool guy.

752
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:10,650
- It's kind of...
- Warm in here, isn't it?

753
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:14,078
- Oh, you're so bald.
- No, no. It's just cancer.

754
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,530
- I'm sorry, what?
- Cancer.

755
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:19,788
Yeah, I have cancer. It's not contagious.

756
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:22,916
Oh, my God.
Well, what Kind of cancer is it?

757
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:26,169
It's spinal.

758
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,295
It's in his spine.

759
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:30,549
I didn't even know that was possible.
How did you get it?

760
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,181
Bad mattress.

761
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:37,138
- He's joking. It was a joke.
- Oh!

762
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:38,264
- He's just kidding.
- Oh, my God.

763
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:41,974
See. He still has a sense of humor about it.
He's inspirational.

764
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:44,480
- It's an inspiration.
- Very cute.

765
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:48,437
Can I... May we touch it?

766
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,864
Is that weird?

767
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:54,694
- Yeah, if you want to.
- You can do more than touch it. Come on.

768
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:57,872
Oh... Oh, this is a really nice head.

769
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,370
Play with it a little.
Let's all rub it together.

770
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:02,417
It will grow if you rub it enough.

771
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:03,915
There you go.

772
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:07,381
What are you doing? Are you okay?

773
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:09,049
I've got to go to sleep.

774
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:13,049
No, man. You can't.
We have to be awake when they're awake.

775
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,471
That's how we have sex.

776
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,300
That's the whole purpose of this.
Don't throw all this away.

777
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:19,056
Don't waste my time, man.

778
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:24,641
Okay. Can you give me an approximate time
when I'll be having sex?

779
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:29,236
Ninety-five minutes from now,
we'll be having sex.

780
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,735
- I'm not gonna make it.
- That's how fucking long it's gonna take.

781
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:33,908
I wish it was sooner.
These girls, 96 minutes.

782
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,656
Hey, what's happening? Look at that.

783
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,988
- Got a wiener.
- You got one!

784
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:41,369
So, you guys want to hit up Lash?
I know the DJ.

785
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,543
- Oh, nice.
- I'm gonna have to crash out.

786
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:49,624
Sorry, I'm just exhausted.
The chemo just takes it out of you.

787
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:58,925
But, you know, I have some really potent
medical weed at my house

788
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:01,010
if you want to come over?

789
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:03,642
- That sounds fun.
- That does sound fun!

790
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:06,098
That's a great idea. I love that.

791
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:09,105
- Game on!
- Yeah, let's do it. Nice!

792
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,858
Let's do it. Let's get a cab.
There's cabs over here.

793
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:17,151
Sensational. That's pimping.

794
00:49:17,246 --> 00:49:20,079
That was actually very pimp.
That was impressive.

795
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:30,039
I'm sorry, am I hurting you?

796
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:32,045
- No, no, keep going.
- Okay.

797
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:37,384
Are you sure? 'Cause you just don't really
look like you're having a good time.

798
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:44,179
Mmm. No, but it does...
It hurts. I'm sorry. Yeah, my back is...

799
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:47,356
- Yeah, maybe you should just...
- I'll get off you.

800
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:48,899
Maybe...

801
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:53,900
- Yeah, if you don't...
- Sorry.

802
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:09,420
I wonder what the machine gun
budget on this film was.

803
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:13,541
You can't afford actors,
but you need one million machine guns.

804
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:17,337
- Can we watch something else?
- No, I want to see how this ends.

805
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:50,494
I fucked her.

806
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:22,408
Adam?

807
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:25,989
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

808
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,240
What are you doing?

809
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,701
Good old chemotherapy.

810
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:33,834
Oh. Waiting for the bus.

811
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:41,091
I'm on my way home right now.
I have my car if you want a ride.

812
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:42,671
I'm used to the bus.

813
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:43,846
- Thank you.
- No, I can't just let you...

814
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,676
I can't make you wait for the bus.

815
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,806
I live kind of far away.

816
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:51,138
I won't take no for an answer.

817
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:03,029
Sorry about the mess.
I'm not good at getting rid of stuff.

818
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,530
Yeah, I see.

819
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:09,578
Let me know if you need to pull over,
or anything.

820
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,078
Like if the chemo's...

821
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:14,037
If you feel nauseous, just say the word
and I'll pull right over.

822
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,712
Okay, thanks.

823
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:19,800
So you don't have a car.

824
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:21,969
No, I don't even have a license actually.

825
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:23,262
Why not?

826
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:27,092
It's incredibly dangerous.
It's like the fifth leading cause of death.

827
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:32,513
Which is, I guess, just a few behind cancer.

828
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,983
Still, the bus?

829
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:38,818
The bus after chemo?

830
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:41,989
Yeah. Well, usually Rachael drives me.

831
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:46,569
But we broke up.

832
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:49,575
She kind of cheated on me.

833
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:55,081
Oh, um...

834
00:52:56,048 --> 00:52:58,209
Adam, do you want to talk about this?

835
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:02,760
You know what? Actually, no.
Let's not do the therapy in the car.

836
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:05,588
- You're just giving me a ride as a friend.
- Yeah, Adam, if...

837
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:08,925
You know, what we should really talk about
is, you have trash on your floor.

838
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,509
And there's no reason.

839
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:13,471
You know, at least have a bag in the back
to put the trash in.

840
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:16,147
Adam, your girlfriend cheated on you.

841
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:19,276
We don't have to talk about it.
We don't have to.

842
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:24,235
I just broke up with somebody
recently myself.

843
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:25,862
- You did?
- Yeah, it sucks.

844
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:29,537
- Sorry.
- No. Well, it's good because...

845
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:38,288
- We actually shouldn't be talking about it.
- Why not?

846
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:40,794
It's not appropriate for me
to tell you personal things

847
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,875
because the patient-therapist relationship
doesn't really work

848
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:45,382
if you know all my problems.

849
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,720
Admittedly I do check his Facebook
like every day

850
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:54,224
to see if he's dating somebody new,
which is so pathetic.

851
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:55,895
I shouldn't have said that.
I should have stopped.

852
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:57,098
Yeah.

853
00:53:57,985 --> 00:54:00,021
- We could just listen to the radio.
- Yes.

854
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:04,813
<i>And our day is coming by and by</i>

855
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:13,823
<i>I'm traveling this long road to be with you</i>

856
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:16,408
- Stop the car.
- Are you okay?

857
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:17,834
- Yeah, let's just stop.
- I'm stopping the car.

858
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:25,505
- I just...
- What are you doing?

859
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:27,552
I just can't handle this mess.

860
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:30,464
Are you serious?

861
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,345
Adam.

862
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:40,475
You don't have to. That's my dinner.
The brown thing is my dinner.

863
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:42,935
- Which one?
- That... This thing.

864
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:45,191
- You're gonna eat that?
- This is new. Don't judge me.

865
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:57,328
Hey, nice. Look at that.

866
00:54:59,588 --> 00:55:01,874
Could you unlock the door?

867
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:20,223
- Thanks for the ride.
- No problem.

868
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:23,935
- Thank you for cleaning my car.
- Yeah.

869
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:30,483
- I'll see you next week.
- Okay.

870
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:32,158
Okay.

871
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:35,488
Uh... Are you gonna be okay by yourself?

872
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:39,784
- Yeah. Yeah, I'll be totally fine.
- Okay.

873
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:42,123
- Bye.
- Bye.

874
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:49,585
Hey, Adam?

875
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:52,713
Listen.

876
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:58,473
I just want you to have my cell number.

877
00:55:58,564 --> 00:56:02,807
Just if you need anything. You have it.

878
00:56:03,235 --> 00:56:06,147
Thanks. Did I just, like, score your digits?

879
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:11,482
- No.
- No. That was a joke.

880
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:13,571
That's fine.

881
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:15,573
- I don't know why I said that.
- No, that's okay.

882
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:17,575
That would be inappropriate.

883
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:19,031
Of course. I know that.

884
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:21,458
It's a defense mechanism. And that's fine.

885
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:23,122
Yeah.

886
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:26,671
That's for emergencies.

887
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:30,258
- And if you need someone to talk to.
- Yeah.

888
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:33,261
- Good night. Okay.
- Good night. Thank you.

889
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:41,645
<i>The great white.</i>

890
00:56:43,609 --> 00:56:46,942
<i>It is the largest predator in the sea.</i>

891
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:50,896
I thought the deserts were crazy.
The ocean's fucking nuts, man.

892
00:56:50,991 --> 00:56:52,197
I like the trees.

893
00:56:52,701 --> 00:56:54,066
The trees are gonna be bananas.

894
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:55,196
Jesus!

895
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:01,407
You okay?

896
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:04,584
- Lift your elbows above your ears.
- What are you talking about?

897
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:07,253
- It helps you stop coughing.
- I'm not doing that.

898
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,256
I always heard it would
help you stop coughing.

899
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:19,637
I'm just here to pick up my things

900
00:57:19,728 --> 00:57:22,891
and then I'll get out of your way.

901
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:26,348
- Yeah, I put all your things in a box.
- Okay.

902
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:28,605
It's outside the door.

903
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:30,686
You walked right past it.

904
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:32,270
Oh.

905
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:35,153
Well, then I guess I'll be on my way.

906
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:41,242
You're smoking weed?

907
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,206
Well, it's medicinal.

908
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:45,830
You got a prescription
for medicinal marijuana?

909
00:57:45,921 --> 00:57:49,209
No, I got a prescription
for medicinal marijuana.

910
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,210
Adam was too afraid.

911
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:54,134
Well, what's wrong with you, Kyle?

912
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:56,086
I have night blindness.

913
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:59,594
My cones and rods are askew

914
00:58:00,686 --> 00:58:02,847
and weed fixes it.

915
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:07,981
You took down my painting.

916
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:11,235
Well, it didn't really fit there
with the new TV.

917
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:15,568
Adam, can I talk to you outside
for a second, please?

918
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:19,071
Yeah.

919
00:58:19,705 --> 00:58:20,740
It's all right.

920
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:29,245
So, how are you feeling?

921
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:31,913
Pretty awesome.

922
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:38,136
I wanted to tell you that I'm really sorry.

923
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:40,926
Well...

924
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,009
I'm sorry, too.

925
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:47,722
I mean, I know this wasn't easy for you.

926
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:53,481
I'm sorry I didn't come to your opening.
It's just because I hate you so much.

927
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:00,401
I'm glad you didn't come.

928
00:59:02,414 --> 00:59:04,496
It was a complete disaster.

929
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:08,287
No one bought any of my paintings.

930
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:14,463
That's weird, they're so good.

931
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:16,128
Really?

932
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,335
Yeah, they're great.
I'm sorry that happened.

933
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:21,342
It's just, you know,
you'll get them next time.

934
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:23,931
Oh, God.

935
00:59:26,772 --> 00:59:29,138
I don't want to break up.

936
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:32,940
I can do better.

937
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:38,439
We can start over again,

938
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:42,651
and I'll just do better.

939
00:59:43,205 --> 00:59:44,911
You should go.

940
00:59:51,046 --> 00:59:52,911
Really, you should. You should go.

941
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:55,338
I don't want to go.
I want to stay here with you.

942
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,837
No. No. You know what? Seriously.

943
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:02,671
You should get
the fuck off my porch. Now.

944
01:00:07,479 --> 01:00:09,015
That's the box.

945
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,982
- Your painting?
- I made it for you.

946
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,029
<i>I was all right</i>

947
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:30,745
<i>For a while</i>

948
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:35,545
<i>I could smile for a while</i>

949
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:41,085
<i>But I saw you last night</i>
<i>You held my hand so tight</i>

950
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:45,173
<i>As you stopped to say, "Hello"</i>

951
01:00:46,935 --> 01:00:49,597
<i>You wished me well</i>

952
01:00:50,272 --> 01:00:52,012
<i>You couldn't tell</i>

953
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:59,187
<i>That I'd been crying over you</i>

954
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:04,320
<i>Crying over you</i>

955
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:08,487
<i>Then you said, "So long"</i>

956
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:13,200
<i>Left me standing all alone</i>

957
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:14,455
<i>Alone and crying</i>

958
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:16,662
- It actually looks a lot better.
- It's not that bad like this.

959
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:18,542
Yeah. We could hang this up.

960
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,546
You were around before TV, right?

961
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:25,761
No, 'cause I want to hear about the radio.

962
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:29,512
Because the radio used to be like
a really... We work in radio, right?

963
01:01:29,603 --> 01:01:30,843
Yeah.

964
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:33,019
Like, they talk about people
just sitting around

965
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:35,188
and listening to the radio, like, actively.

966
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:36,890
Glued to the radio. Yeah.

967
01:01:36,985 --> 01:01:38,191
Well, what did you listen to?

968
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:39,609
<i>Little Orphan Annie.</i>

969
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:42,863
<i>What did you look at while you were</i>
<i>listening to it? Just nothing?</i>

970
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:45,361
It engaged everything somehow.

971
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:47,283
<i>What kind of stuff do you guys do?</i>

972
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:49,031
I'm doing this piece on a volcano.

973
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:51,704
I do radio that I think people
would actually want to listen to.

974
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:53,782
Mostly stuff about food.

975
01:01:53,877 --> 01:01:56,368
- Best hamburger. Best hamburger in Seattle.
- People like to listen...

976
01:01:56,463 --> 01:01:58,670
You'd listen to that as opposed to,
"Hey, coming up next,

977
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:01,631
"you're gonna hear a guy talk about
a volcano for twenty minutes."

978
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,254
- You know what I'd do?
- What?

979
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:04,801
I'd turn on the TV.

980
01:02:04,888 --> 01:02:07,049
Yeah.
That would be a very good idea.

981
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,471
It's not the same.

982
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:10,678
What do you mean,
it's not the same?

983
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:13,055
You get audio and video.

984
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:16,138
Guys, Bernie blended up some Wheatgrass.

985
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:17,313
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

986
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,891
It's like drinking liquid lawn cuttings.

987
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:24,529
Jesus! Bernie, Adam.

988
01:02:24,616 --> 01:02:26,823
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

989
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:27,990
Hi, Adam.

990
01:02:28,078 --> 01:02:29,568
And this is my friend, Kyle.

991
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:31,619
- Oh, God.
- Good, you like it.

992
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,655
It's not good.

993
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,666
So, Adam, I'm surprised.

994
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:40,162
The way Mitch talks about you
I thought you were much older.

995
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:42,589
He's 85 years old.
He just looks really good.

996
01:02:44,678 --> 01:02:46,043
Okay, I got to go.

997
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:47,593
No, no, honey. Come on, stay.

998
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:49,546
Stick around. I haven't seen you all day.

999
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:51,009
- Are you all right?
- I'm good.

1000
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:53,012
Good stuff. Good stuff.

1001
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:56,139
Really good stuff. I love you.

1002
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,513
I love you, too.

1003
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:02,608
Mom, I'm sorry.
I can't talk about this anymore.

1004
01:03:02,696 --> 01:03:04,778
I'm at an appointment, okay?
And I'm late already.

1005
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:06,604
Yes, I'm here. I'm standing in the office

1006
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,531
talking on the phone to you.
So I'm just gonna get off.

1007
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:09,903
<i>I just want to know</i>
<i>if you tried those recipes.</i>

1008
01:03:09,995 --> 01:03:11,360
Okay.

1009
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:12,910
<i>Do you know what you're gonna make</i>
<i>for dinner?</i>

1010
01:03:12,998 --> 01:03:14,863
I don't know what I'm gonna make
for dinner.

1011
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:18,166
I'll figure something out, okay?
I'm hanging up now. Goodbye.

1012
01:03:18,253 --> 01:03:19,459
<i>Bye. I love you.</i>

1013
01:03:19,546 --> 01:03:21,377
Me, too. Bye.

1014
01:03:22,674 --> 01:03:25,757
God. Sorry about that.

1015
01:03:25,844 --> 01:03:28,802
Don't worry about it. I have parents, too.

1016
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:31,220
Do yours give you migraines?

1017
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:34,758
Well, I would talk to my therapist
about my parents.

1018
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:35,929
Really?

1019
01:03:36,021 --> 01:03:39,309
Yeah, we could do role play.
I'll be your mom.

1020
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:41,890
Oh, God, no. That's disgusting.

1021
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:44,184
Why is that disgusting?

1022
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:46,485
Uh...

1023
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:50,031
No, it's not. I mean, okay, my mom...

1024
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:55,321
I don't know. She's a crazy person.
She just worries all day every day.

1025
01:03:55,832 --> 01:04:00,451
And honestly it annoys the shit out of me.
It's way too much.

1026
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:02,831
And it's not helpful

1027
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:06,164
and I can't talk to her.
I don't call her back.

1028
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:09,793
It's a problem.

1029
01:04:09,888 --> 01:04:12,925
So she's got this husband
that can't talk to her

1030
01:04:13,016 --> 01:04:16,053
and this son that won't?

1031
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:23,106
Yeah, I guess.

1032
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:26,354
Makes you kind of a dick.

1033
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,111
Me?

1034
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:32,941
Is that like the medical term?

1035
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:36,028
Yeah, I mean, listen...

1036
01:04:37,457 --> 01:04:38,742
You can't change who your parents are.

1037
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:42,997
The only thing you can change
is how you choose to deal with that.

1038
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:50,588
Aren't you supposed to, like, subtly
manipulate me into figuring this stuff out?

1039
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:52,088
Not just call me on my shit?

1040
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:56,799
Yeah, you cleaned my car.
So we're completely beyond that.

1041
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:08,185
It's weird, isn't it? Shouldn't have
done it. Shouldn't have gone for it.

1042
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:11,521
- It was good. It was good. It's all right.
- No, it wasn't. It was so forced, I'm sorry.

1043
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:14,904
- Try it again. I was too far.
- Okay.

1044
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:16,780
- If I'm a little closer.
- It'll make it really natural.

1045
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:18,031
- Yeah.
- Totally.

1046
01:05:21,543 --> 01:05:22,658
That was better.

1047
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:26,127
Okay.

1048
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:34,966
- You're all set.
- Thanks.

1049
01:05:39,227 --> 01:05:40,763
Where's Mitch?

1050
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:45,263
He died last night.

1051
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:55,110
We were just with him. He was fine.
What happened?

1052
01:05:55,994 --> 01:05:58,155
What does it matter? His heart stopped.

1053
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:32,944
"He leads me in the paths
of righteousness for his name's sake.

1054
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:35,317
"Even though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death

1055
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:38,616
"I will fear no evil for thou art with me.

1056
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:41,615
"Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

1057
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:45,870
"Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies."

1058
01:06:53,593 --> 01:06:56,005
<i>Nation, I have your test results.</i>

1059
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:59,967
<i>Good news! You're me-positive.</i>

1060
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:03,596
<i>This is</i> Cheating Death
<i>with Dr. Stephen T. Colbert.</i>

1061
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:05,677
<i>... speculation, Mount Moa Moa,</i>

1062
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:09,356
<i>located on the highlands of Savai'i,</i>
<i>erupted early this morning,</i>

1063
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:13,651
<i>shooting a plume of black ash and smoke</i>
<i>nearly four miles into the air.</i>

1064
01:07:13,738 --> 01:07:17,071
<i>Initial reports this morning suggested</i>
<i>that Mount Moa Moa was getting weaker.</i>

1065
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:21,197
<i>Our analyst can now confirm that</i>
<i>the volcano is actually growing stronger.</i>

1066
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:25,701
<i>Again, Mount Moa Moa has just erupted.</i>
<i>This is live footage taken...</i>

1067
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:47,931
So, I think I'm starting to realize
I'm probably gonna die.

1068
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:52,649
- Did something happen?
- No, it's just... Look at me.

1069
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:58,814
I wake up and I look in the mirror
and, like, it's pretty obvious, you know.

1070
01:08:01,286 --> 01:08:06,701
Mitch died. Alan's probably gonna die.

1071
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:09,825
And, you know, so am I.

1072
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:12,164
You don't know that.

1073
01:08:12,255 --> 01:08:14,496
And a lot of what you're feeling right now
is from the treatment.

1074
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:17,378
I know, but it's... Look.

1075
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:21,294
Thank you,
but you don't have to try and cheer me up.

1076
01:08:21,389 --> 01:08:26,679
I'm actually really okay with it. You know.
Okay, I'm gonna die.

1077
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:28,100
You're gonna die.

1078
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:30,803
You know, hopefully a lot later than I am.

1079
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:33,935
It's just what happens. And, you know,

1080
01:08:36,321 --> 01:08:38,027
it doesn't really mean anything anyway.

1081
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:41,443
Okay. I mean, Adam, right now

1082
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:44,651
you're going through
what's called the alienation phase.

1083
01:08:44,746 --> 01:08:47,783
And I know that you feel really helpless.

1084
01:08:47,874 --> 01:08:51,458
But I think it's important to remember
that the way you feel

1085
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:53,785
is completely normal
for someone in your situation.

1086
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:58,464
Sorry, but I just have to call you on this.

1087
01:08:58,551 --> 01:08:59,882
It's just bullshit.

1088
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,676
It's what everybody has been saying
from the beginning.

1089
01:09:02,764 --> 01:09:05,847
Like, "Well, you'll feel better,"
and, "Don't worry," and, "This is all fine."

1090
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:08,390
And, like, it's not. You know?

1091
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:12,311
I don't know why everybody's
so fucking scared to just say it.

1092
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:14,263
Like, "You're dying, dude."

1093
01:09:16,444 --> 01:09:21,029
It makes it worse that
no one will just say it.

1094
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:24,824
Okay. Um...

1095
01:09:27,455 --> 01:09:31,039
Adam, I'm here to help you.
I'm trying to help you.

1096
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:32,285
Why?

1097
01:09:34,128 --> 01:09:36,369
So thirty years from now
you can be at some cocktail party,

1098
01:09:36,464 --> 01:09:39,831
and tell an inspiring anecdote
about your third patient ever,

1099
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:42,759
and how you coached him
into feeling normal right before he died?

1100
01:09:42,929 --> 01:09:45,545
Okay, Adam, I'm sorry
if I'm saying the wrong things.

1101
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:48,052
I'm trying. I really am.

1102
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:52,602
No, you know what? This just isn't working.
I don't know why I came here.

1103
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:06,403
<i>This is Kyle.</i>
<i>I'm not around. Leave a message.</i>

1104
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:11,371
Hey, man.
I'm just calling to see if you could take me

1105
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:14,915
to the doctor's appointment tomorrow.

1106
01:10:18,965 --> 01:10:20,876
It's the big one. So...

1107
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:39,474
<i>Oh, my God! What's wrong?</i>

1108
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:44,271
Hi, Mom.

1109
01:10:44,365 --> 01:10:45,901
The doctor's just in
with another patient.

1110
01:10:45,992 --> 01:10:47,653
He should be out in a few minutes.

1111
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:49,741
Are you guys holding up all right?

1112
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:53,071
It's cold in here. Is there any way
you can lower the air conditioning?

1113
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:56,579
Unfortunately the temperature
is controlled by a central thermostat.

1114
01:10:58,796 --> 01:11:00,787
My son has cancer.

1115
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:04,207
Really, if I could I would.
But there is nothing I can do.

1116
01:11:04,343 --> 01:11:06,629
Don't worry about it. I'm fine.

1117
01:11:07,138 --> 01:11:09,504
- Are you sure? I can get you a blanket.
- I'm really okay. Thanks.

1118
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:11,388
- I'd love a blanket.
- We're fine.

1119
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:14,971
Okay, but if you need anything
you let me know.

1120
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:24,852
I don't like her.

1121
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:30,612
You're warm.

1122
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:34,287
I'm fine.

1123
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:46,624
Hmm.

1124
01:11:48,513 --> 01:11:50,299
- What?
- Nothing.

1125
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:51,629
What?

1126
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:54,716
He just went to a state college, that's all.

1127
01:11:54,894 --> 01:11:56,600
You're unbelievable.

1128
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:59,224
I just worry you're not getting
the best care possible.

1129
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:01,306
Would you just stop it? Please?

1130
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,891
I'm not him. I can take care of myself.

1131
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:07,228
It's just so hard
when you won't let me take care of you.

1132
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:09,564
- It's just really hard.
- I am letting you take care of me.

1133
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:12,150
You drove me here,
didn't you? Didn't you?

1134
01:12:35,935 --> 01:12:37,641
And what about you?

1135
01:12:38,104 --> 01:12:39,594
What about me?

1136
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:42,430
How are you?

1137
01:12:47,405 --> 01:12:48,941
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1138
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:51,989
You know, what's going on in your life?

1139
01:12:52,076 --> 01:12:57,036
The highlight of my week is this
cancer support group I've been going to.

1140
01:12:57,123 --> 01:12:59,535
You're going to a support group?

1141
01:13:00,543 --> 01:13:03,831
It's for parents whose kids have cancer.

1142
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:08,794
I didn't know you were doing that.

1143
01:13:09,844 --> 01:13:12,460
How could you? You never call me back.

1144
01:13:17,018 --> 01:13:19,555
You're right. I'm sorry.

1145
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:25,769
You don't have to say you're sorry.

1146
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:36,408
Sorry to keep you folks waiting.

1147
01:13:41,876 --> 01:13:44,743
Anyway, I will cut to the chase.

1148
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:47,670
The cancer is not responding to the chemo.

1149
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:53,551
As you can see the tumor is continuing
to grow here along the nerve.

1150
01:13:53,638 --> 01:13:57,005
We have to remove it now,
or we risk metastasis.

1151
01:13:57,099 --> 01:14:00,762
- Okay, so what do we do?
- We need to operate.

1152
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:02,184
Now I've moved some things around

1153
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:05,138
and I can get you in this Thursday morning
with Dr. Walderson.

1154
01:14:05,232 --> 01:14:07,188
She is one of our finest neurosurgeons.

1155
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:10,359
But he's gonna be okay, right?
You're going to fix it.

1156
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:14,276
Considering the placement
and the size of the tumor,

1157
01:14:14,367 --> 01:14:16,904
a surgery of this nature
is always very dangerous

1158
01:14:16,994 --> 01:14:19,610
and potentially life-threatening itself.

1159
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:22,617
The surgeons will attempt to be
very aggressive.

1160
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:26,542
However if we are not successful
in removing the cancer,

1161
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:29,746
then unfortunately
we will be out of options.

1162
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:41,803
I'm not gonna bring up the fact
that your surgery is tomorrow.

1163
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:44,306
I'm not even thinking about it.
So, don't worry about it,

1164
01:14:44,397 --> 01:14:47,139
'cause I'm not gonna bring it up.

1165
01:14:47,233 --> 01:14:49,849
You remember the last time we were here?

1166
01:14:49,944 --> 01:14:52,401
Yeah. It was prom night.

1167
01:14:56,575 --> 01:15:00,909
The memory seems really far away.

1168
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:05,957
Yeah. It was a long time ago.
I don't even remember who you went with.

1169
01:15:06,043 --> 01:15:07,624
Nora Mattingly.

1170
01:15:07,712 --> 01:15:11,500
That girl... That girl sucked.
You knew how to pick them.

1171
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:14,673
- Even then I think you knew.
- Yeah.

1172
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,751
Well, she seemed sweet.

1173
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:19,178
No, she didn't. She always sucked.

1174
01:15:19,265 --> 01:15:22,052
- You just always hate my girlfriends.
- That's not true.

1175
01:15:23,102 --> 01:15:24,342
Okay, it is actually.

1176
01:15:24,437 --> 01:15:28,305
But it's because you always date people
who are fucking dickheads, man.

1177
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:31,607
You date needy bitches. Why?

1178
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:39,903
It's fucking cold.

1179
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:45,029
And it's only midnight.

1180
01:15:45,124 --> 01:15:47,866
Dude, let's go to the bar, man.
Let's try to get laid.

1181
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:51,418
- What's the fucking point?
- Come on. Live in the now.

1182
01:15:51,505 --> 01:15:54,212
- I have fun with that.
- I know you have fun with it.

1183
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:56,541
Well, you could, too, maybe. Let's do it.

1184
01:15:56,635 --> 01:15:57,966
You're drunk.

1185
01:15:58,054 --> 01:16:00,670
It worked. Take your hat off.

1186
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:04,424
- You're just gonna leave this here?
- A homeless gentleman will collect it.

1187
01:16:04,769 --> 01:16:06,805
- Oh, fuck.
- Are you drunk?

1188
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:08,727
- You're really drunk.
- I'm a little drunk.

1189
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,054
You think I should drive?

1190
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:13,312
I would let you drive
but you don't know how.

1191
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:17,486
You don't have a license even.
That's so funny.

1192
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:20,773
It might be my last chance.

1193
01:16:22,495 --> 01:16:23,985
- So you want to drive, right now?
- Yeah.

1194
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,571
That's what you want to do?

1195
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:28,951
That's your make-a-wish? To drive?

1196
01:16:29,502 --> 01:16:32,710
We could be having sex with hookers
while skydiving right now.

1197
01:16:32,797 --> 01:16:36,164
And instead you want to do something
I learned to do when I was fifteen?

1198
01:16:36,342 --> 01:16:38,082
Can I have the keys?

1199
01:16:43,182 --> 01:16:44,843
Okay. Be careful.

1200
01:16:46,519 --> 01:16:47,508
Whoa!

1201
01:16:48,187 --> 01:16:50,018
Just drive carefully.

1202
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:56,150
Don't change my seat adjustment, okay?
It's all in places I like.

1203
01:16:56,654 --> 01:16:59,942
Okay. Okay. Now the first thing...

1204
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:05,359
What the fuck!

1205
01:17:07,414 --> 01:17:10,326
Make a left.
Make a left! It's a one-way street.

1206
01:17:10,417 --> 01:17:12,829
What the fuck! Jesus Christ!

1207
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:14,956
There's a car! Wrong way! Wrong way!

1208
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:18,960
Christ, dude. What the hell?
Adam! Stop, man!

1209
01:17:19,051 --> 01:17:20,166
Stop!

1210
01:17:22,346 --> 01:17:23,882
What the fuck are you doing, man?

1211
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:26,635
- You're being an idiot right now.
- Get out.

1212
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:28,135
- Get out? This is my car.
- Get out of the car.

1213
01:17:28,227 --> 01:17:30,263
- Get out. Just get out!
- Don't hit me!

1214
01:17:30,354 --> 01:17:31,890
- I can't fucking let you do this.
- Get out!

1215
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:33,687
Jesus Christ, man!

1216
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:35,560
Shit.

1217
01:18:01,844 --> 01:18:02,959
Oh, no.

1218
01:18:03,596 --> 01:18:05,552
No, you are not calling her, man!

1219
01:18:06,265 --> 01:18:09,098
After what she did to you!
You're a pussy, Adam.

1220
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:11,926
You're a selfish piece of shit!

1221
01:18:12,021 --> 01:18:15,809
You care more about getting yourself
fucking laid than being my friend.

1222
01:18:22,406 --> 01:18:24,613
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, it's Adam.

1223
01:18:25,159 --> 01:18:28,572
Adam? It's midnight. What's going on?

1224
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:31,536
I'm just probably having
a nervous breakdown.

1225
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:34,619
I think I just fractured my larynx.

1226
01:18:37,254 --> 01:18:39,961
I'm really, really glad that you called.

1227
01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:46,298
I just want it to be over.
I'm so fucking tired of being sick.

1228
01:18:52,144 --> 01:18:56,137
<i>You know, if this surgery doesn't work,</i>
<i>it's... That's it.</i>

1229
01:18:57,816 --> 01:19:02,435
And I've never, you know...
I've never been to fucking Canada.

1230
01:19:02,529 --> 01:19:05,942
I've never told a girl I loved her.

1231
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:10,568
<i>It sounds stupid, doesn't it?</i>

1232
01:19:10,663 --> 01:19:12,278
No, it doesn't.

1233
01:19:13,958 --> 01:19:17,416
Sorry. I was such an asshole the other day.

1234
01:19:18,003 --> 01:19:22,121
<i>No, I was an asshole.</i>
<i>I was totally unprepared for you.</i>

1235
01:19:23,133 --> 01:19:25,089
This job is really hard.

1236
01:19:28,138 --> 01:19:30,504
If I fuck up
I can ruin somebody's whole life.

1237
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:34,592
Well, I guess we're both beginners at this.

1238
01:19:34,687 --> 01:19:35,802
<i>Yeah.</i>

1239
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:39,638
<i>What were you doing when I called?</i>

1240
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:42,187
Were you on Facebook?

1241
01:19:43,195 --> 01:19:47,859
You know, stalking my ex-boyfriend actually
isn't the only thing I do in my free time.

1242
01:19:49,952 --> 01:19:51,817
I wish you were my girlfriend.

1243
01:19:59,878 --> 01:20:01,834
Girlfriends can be nice.

1244
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:06,211
<i>You just had a bad one.</i>

1245
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:09,551
I bet you would be a good one.

1246
01:20:14,059 --> 01:20:17,927
Let me in,
man. Jesus. It's fucking freezing.

1247
01:20:18,022 --> 01:20:19,808
<i>I'm gonna go.</i>

1248
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:21,684
- Yeah, it's no problem.
- <i>Thanks.</i>

1249
01:20:22,359 --> 01:20:24,020
Thanks for everything.

1250
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:26,231
Good night.

1251
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:44,244
Come here, boy.

1252
01:22:45,586 --> 01:22:46,746
Yeah.

1253
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:42,347
Okay. Ready?

1254
01:23:43,268 --> 01:23:44,883
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1255
01:23:45,145 --> 01:23:47,477
- It's gonna be good. It's going to be fine.
- Yeah.

1256
01:23:47,564 --> 01:23:49,646
- Adam.
- That's your mom.

1257
01:23:49,733 --> 01:23:50,848
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1258
01:23:50,943 --> 01:23:52,308
Awesome.

1259
01:23:54,738 --> 01:23:56,899
So, I'll just... I'll park the car, I guess.

1260
01:23:56,990 --> 01:24:00,198
And then I'll come in and I'll see you
before you go in there, right?

1261
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:03,197
Yeah, there's...
It depends on if they bring me in first.

1262
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:05,700
- If not before then...
- Right after.

1263
01:24:05,791 --> 01:24:08,203
- Yeah, I'll see you after.
- Okay.

1264
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:17,465
- Yeah.
- Take care, man.

1265
01:24:20,973 --> 01:24:23,464
Okay. I'll see you in there.

1266
01:24:27,854 --> 01:24:29,094
Thanks.

1267
01:24:38,532 --> 01:24:39,863
- Good morning, Adam.
- Hi.

1268
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:42,657
I'm Dr. Walderson.
I'm gonna be doing your surgery today.

1269
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:44,326
- How are you feeling?
- Great, thanks.

1270
01:24:44,413 --> 01:24:46,074
Good. Good, good.

1271
01:24:46,832 --> 01:24:50,791
So, we're gonna take excellent care
of you. The surgical team is top notch.

1272
01:24:50,877 --> 01:24:52,538
Just try to relax.

1273
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:54,870
- See you later.
- Thanks.

1274
01:24:54,965 --> 01:24:56,876
- What's this?
- Standard paperwork.

1275
01:24:57,009 --> 01:25:01,924
Hospital liability and disclaimer forms,
and organ donor authorization.

1276
01:25:02,014 --> 01:25:03,845
- Sign right there.
- Okay.

1277
01:25:07,311 --> 01:25:08,642
Thanks.

1278
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:13,938
- I got a new coat.
- Yeah?

1279
01:25:14,026 --> 01:25:17,359
Brooks Brothers. Silk pockets, feel.

1280
01:25:18,071 --> 01:25:19,652
- Feel.
- I'm feeling.

1281
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:21,526
- Nice?
- Yeah.

1282
01:25:21,617 --> 01:25:22,857
Listen.

1283
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:25,859
I know it's a little hard to follow
everything that's going on right now.

1284
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:30,573
But I just want you to know,
I love you, very much.

1285
01:25:34,671 --> 01:25:37,663
- Okay.
- Okay, Dad.

1286
01:25:38,383 --> 01:25:39,498
Okay.

1287
01:25:40,218 --> 01:25:41,924
Hello, Adam. I'm Dr. Lee.

1288
01:25:42,012 --> 01:25:43,548
I am here to administer your anesthesia.

1289
01:25:43,639 --> 01:25:44,879
Okay. Hi.

1290
01:25:45,057 --> 01:25:46,718
Excuse me, please.

1291
01:25:47,351 --> 01:25:50,468
Now, just relax. I'm going to inject
the anesthesia through your IV.

1292
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:52,803
It's gonna take a few moments
before you start to feel the effects.

1293
01:25:52,898 --> 01:25:54,183
You're doing it now?

1294
01:25:54,274 --> 01:25:56,481
If you guys just want to head over
to the waiting room that'd be great.

1295
01:25:56,568 --> 01:25:59,685
- And how long does it last?
- That really depends on the individual.

1296
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:01,611
Right, but how do you know
it's gonna last long enough

1297
01:26:01,698 --> 01:26:05,486
so I don't wake up in
the middle of the surgery?

1298
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:08,618
So that you make sure
that I'm gonna wake up after.

1299
01:26:08,705 --> 01:26:09,740
Mom.

1300
01:26:11,291 --> 01:26:13,907
Sweetie, you're gonna be just fine.

1301
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:24,756
I'm really sorry but we need
to get Adam to the operating room.

1302
01:26:24,888 --> 01:26:27,470
Could you just wait a moment, please?

1303
01:26:31,895 --> 01:26:33,431
I'm sorry.

1304
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:37,772
I love you.

1305
01:26:39,695 --> 01:26:43,438
<i>I won't run far</i>

1306
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:47,357
<i>I can always be found</i>

1307
01:26:47,953 --> 01:26:51,320
<i>I can always be found</i>

1308
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:55,908
<i>Ah</i>

1309
01:26:57,129 --> 01:26:59,836
<i>Ah</i>

1310
01:27:00,132 --> 01:27:03,966
<i>If you need me</i>

1311
01:27:04,344 --> 01:27:07,632
<i>If you need me</i>

01:27:08,432 --> 01:27:12,016
<i>If you need me</i>

<i>I can always be found</i>

1314
01:27:16,648 --> 01:27:20,266
<i>I can always be found</i>

<i>If you want me to stay</i>

01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:52,927
<i>If you want me to stay</i>

1323
01:27:53,310 --> 01:28:01,308
<i>I will stay by your side</i>

1324
01:28:01,526 --> 01:28:05,394
<i>I will stay by your side</i>

1325
01:28:06,573 --> 01:28:09,690
<i>Ah</i>

1326
01:28:10,619 --> 01:28:13,656

<i>If you need...</i>

1331
01:28:37,395 --> 01:28:38,726
It's been five hours.

1332
01:28:39,898 --> 01:28:40,887
Has it?

1333
01:28:42,234 --> 01:28:44,725
Something's wrong,
we should have heard by now.

1334
01:28:46,363 --> 01:28:48,900
Don't worry.
Adam's gonna be fine. Okay?

1335
01:28:52,786 --> 01:28:55,493
- Um, Adam Lerner?
- Yeah.

1336
01:28:57,290 --> 01:29:00,202
Dr. Walderson's one of the best surgeons
in the country.

1337
01:29:00,293 --> 01:29:01,954
So, he's in good hands.

1338
01:29:03,088 --> 01:29:04,453
Who are you?

1339
01:29:06,299 --> 01:29:07,789
I'm Katherine.

1340
01:29:09,135 --> 01:29:13,048
- I'm...
- Therapist. Yeah.

1341
01:29:13,306 --> 01:29:15,297
I'm Kyle. I'm Adam's friend.

1342
01:29:15,392 --> 01:29:16,928
Hi. Hi.

1343
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:19,847
These are Adam's parents.

1344
01:29:22,899 --> 01:29:24,059
It's nice to meet you guys.

1345
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:27,358
Did he say I'm a dick? 'Cause I'm not.

1346
01:29:27,445 --> 01:29:30,562
I want you to know I smothered him
because I love him.

1347
01:29:34,661 --> 01:29:36,367
Seriously, did he say anything?

1348
01:29:36,454 --> 01:29:42,495
I can't. I wouldn't talk about
that kind of thing anyway.

1349
01:29:52,304 --> 01:29:54,135
Mr. and Mrs. Lerner?

1350
01:29:56,433 --> 01:30:00,176
So, as you can imagine with a surgery
of this magnitude,

1351
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:03,182
there were some unforeseen complications.

1352
01:30:03,273 --> 01:30:06,356
The bone erosion was much greater
than initially anticipated.

1353
01:30:06,443 --> 01:30:10,652
We had to remove part of the hip and pelvis,
as well as most of the right psoas muscle.

1354
01:30:11,489 --> 01:30:15,482
We also had to remove a good amount of
the sheath tissue around the sciatic nerve.

1355
01:30:16,202 --> 01:30:19,820
It's not gonna be an easy road back,
but he's gonna be okay.

1356
01:30:20,373 --> 01:30:22,238
He's gonna be okay?

1357
01:30:23,043 --> 01:30:24,999
You should start
with that information, okay?

1358
01:30:25,086 --> 01:30:27,452
That should be the first thing you say.

1359
01:30:27,547 --> 01:30:29,083
Good.

1360
01:30:29,174 --> 01:30:31,005
He's gonna be okay.

1361
01:30:31,092 --> 01:30:33,674
Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.

1362
01:30:39,017 --> 01:30:40,177
Mommy.

1363
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:44,427
My little boy.

1364
01:30:44,522 --> 01:30:45,932
- Hi, Dad.
- Adam.

1365
01:30:46,024 --> 01:30:49,642
- It's nice here. We got a good room.
- I know.

1366
01:30:49,736 --> 01:30:51,101
We need to go on more vacations.

1367
01:30:51,196 --> 01:30:55,405
Yes, we'll go on a huge vacation.
We'll go to Hawaii.

1368
01:30:58,662 --> 01:31:00,198
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

1369
01:31:00,288 --> 01:31:02,119
What's up?

1370
01:31:02,207 --> 01:31:05,699
I'm afraid to touch you,
but it's good to see you, dude. Yeah.

1371
01:31:05,794 --> 01:31:07,079
Boom.

1372
01:31:07,253 --> 01:31:10,711
You look... You look really good.

1373
01:31:10,799 --> 01:31:13,882
I'm high as a motherfucker.

1374
01:31:14,177 --> 01:31:15,758
we don't get high.

1375
01:31:16,471 --> 01:31:17,506
Cool, man.

1376
01:31:32,445 --> 01:31:34,060
It's you.

1377
01:31:34,155 --> 01:31:35,770
It is me.

1378
01:31:38,201 --> 01:31:39,486
How are you feeling?

1379
01:31:40,412 --> 01:31:45,076
Great. I love morphine.

1380
01:31:46,876 --> 01:31:48,582
What time is it?

1381
01:31:48,837 --> 01:31:50,577
Um... It's 8:00.

1382
01:31:52,048 --> 01:31:54,664
I was just working late
so I thought I would stop by.

1383
01:31:54,759 --> 01:31:58,092
Working late?
Do you have a new patient?

1384
01:31:58,763 --> 01:32:01,049
I got a few new patients actually.

1385
01:32:01,141 --> 01:32:02,551
That's good.

1386
01:32:04,644 --> 01:32:07,852
I want to make you pancakes sometime.

1387
01:32:08,773 --> 01:32:12,357
- That is really nice, Adam.
- You're gonna like it.

1388
01:32:34,799 --> 01:32:36,630
I'm peeing right now.

1389
01:32:38,553 --> 01:32:40,544
I'm not gonna look.

1390
01:32:49,314 --> 01:32:50,929
Oh, it's gross!

1391
01:32:51,024 --> 01:32:53,481
Oh, God. Okay. I just need to...

1392
01:32:54,611 --> 01:32:55,600
Oh!

1393
01:32:56,821 --> 01:32:59,904
Oh, I keep looking back at it,
thinking it's gonna be less gross.

1394
01:32:59,991 --> 01:33:01,401
Can we just get it over with? Come on.

1395
01:33:01,493 --> 01:33:03,905
- Your mom does this?
- She does it all the time.

1396
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:05,201
This is like <i>Saw</i> shit.

1397
01:33:05,288 --> 01:33:08,200
Your words are so comforting.
It's really reassuring.

1398
01:33:08,291 --> 01:33:11,749
- You're a good friend.
- Okay. I'm just gonna do it.

1399
01:33:11,836 --> 01:33:13,918
I'm just gonna act like it's nothing.

1400
01:33:14,005 --> 01:33:16,166
- I'm really proud of you, man.
- Okay. Let's just go.

1401
01:33:16,257 --> 01:33:17,997
Let's just do this.

1402
01:33:18,343 --> 01:33:21,961
Oh, I'm doing it. I'm inside of you!

1403
01:33:22,055 --> 01:33:24,671
- Wait, wait, wait. Is that your finger?
- What?

1404
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:26,176
- Is that your finger?
- No.

1405
01:33:26,267 --> 01:33:28,633
- There's Q-tips.
- I know. I got one.

1406
01:33:28,728 --> 01:33:30,889
- That was your finger.
- It wasn't. What? Is it bad if it was?

1407
01:33:30,980 --> 01:33:32,265
Did you wash your hands?

1408
01:33:32,357 --> 01:33:34,973
It was a Q-tip the whole time.
Don't worry about it.

1409
01:33:35,068 --> 01:33:38,231
This looks like Kuato
from <i>Total Recall.</i>

1410
01:33:38,321 --> 01:33:41,028
- "The oxygen."
- No! Don't do that.

1411
01:33:42,242 --> 01:33:45,780
Can we get this going? It's 7:30 now.
Come on, put the bandage on.

1412
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:47,201
Excuse me.

1413
01:33:49,874 --> 01:33:52,957
And you are ready for your date.

1414
01:33:53,753 --> 01:33:56,870
All right-y, there we go.

1415
01:34:01,970 --> 01:34:04,552
That's crazy. I look pretty good.

1416
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:06,675
- I'd fuck you.
- Thanks.

1417
01:34:08,184 --> 01:34:09,390
Who could that be?

1418
01:34:09,477 --> 01:34:11,058
Go answer it. Just go.

1419
01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:16,056
- Hey.
- Hey.

1420
01:34:16,151 --> 01:34:17,687
You look nice.

1421
01:34:17,777 --> 01:34:21,520
Thanks. You, too. You look super nice.

1422
01:34:23,283 --> 01:34:25,365
- You want to come in?
- Yeah.

1423
01:34:25,451 --> 01:34:26,816
Nice place.

1424
01:34:28,079 --> 01:34:30,035
Look at you. Walking up a storm.

1425
01:34:30,123 --> 01:34:32,239
Oh, la, la, la, la.

1426
01:34:34,836 --> 01:34:36,576
- You remember Kyle.
- Yeah, hi.

1427
01:34:36,671 --> 01:34:38,536
- Hi.
- Good to see you. We met before.

1428
01:34:38,631 --> 01:34:41,293
I see you brought pizza which is good
because I haven't fed him yet all day.

1429
01:34:41,384 --> 01:34:43,124
I did just change the dressing on his wound.

1430
01:34:43,219 --> 01:34:44,959
- Yeah, he came to...
- If it starts seeping though,

1431
01:34:45,054 --> 01:34:46,339
I left all the stuff out.

1432
01:34:46,431 --> 01:34:48,513
There's some Vicodin in the bathroom
if you need it.

1433
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:52,013
I know people take it recreationally,
but he actually needs it for his aches.

1434
01:34:52,103 --> 01:34:54,185
Are there channels he can't watch?

1435
01:34:56,441 --> 01:34:58,682
That's funny. See, she's cool.

1436
01:34:58,776 --> 01:35:00,641
So, you're doing your doctorate, I hear?
That's...

1437
01:35:00,737 --> 01:35:01,726
- Dude?
- Yeah.

1438
01:35:01,821 --> 01:35:03,061
- You're awesome.
- Yeah.

1439
01:35:03,156 --> 01:35:05,021
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Okay.

1440
01:35:05,116 --> 01:35:07,448
- She's cool. She's funny.
- I know.

1441
01:35:25,428 --> 01:35:26,838
So...

1442
01:35:28,932 --> 01:35:30,263
So...

1443
01:35:32,769 --> 01:35:34,054
Now what?

1444
01:35:40,485 --> 01:35:46,321
<i>Unsealed on a porch a letter sat</i>

1445
01:35:47,283 --> 01:35:52,118
<i>Then you said,</i>
<i>"I want to leave it again"</i>

1446
01:35:53,998 --> 01:35:59,914
<i>Once I saw her</i>
<i>on a beach of weathered sand</i>

1447
01:36:00,838 --> 01:36:05,673
<i>And on the sand,</i>
<i>"I wanna leave it again"</i>

1448
01:36:06,177 --> 01:36:07,337
<i>Yeah</i>

1449
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:12,464
<i>On a weekend, I wanna wish it all away, yeah</i>

1450
01:36:12,934 --> 01:36:19,681
<i>And they called and I said that</i>
<i>"I want what I said," then I call out again</i>

1451
01:36:21,359 --> 01:36:27,730
<i>And the reason ought to leave</i>
<i>her calm, I know</i>

1452
01:36:28,032 --> 01:36:33,117
<i>I said, "I know what I waited,</i>
<i>not a boxer or the bag"</i>

1453
01:36:33,371 --> 01:36:38,536
<i>Oh, yeah, can you see them</i>

1454
01:36:39,544 --> 01:36:41,660
<i>Out on the porch?</i>

1455
01:36:42,505 --> 01:36:47,044
<i>Yeah, but they don't wave</i>

1456
01:36:47,135 --> 01:36:53,847
<i>I see them</i>
<i>round the front way, yeah</i>

1457
01:36:53,933 --> 01:36:59,394
<i>And I know and I know</i>
<i>I don't wanna stay</i>

1458
01:37:00,606 --> 01:37:02,016
<i>At all</i>

1459
01:37:03,067 --> 01:37:06,025
<i>I don't wanna stay</i>

1460
01:37:09,991 --> 01:37:12,323
<i>I don't wanna stay</i>

1461
01:37:12,410 --> 01:37:15,823
<i>I don't... Don't wanna... Oh...</i>

1462
01:37:17,457 --> 01:37:18,742
<i>Yeah</i>

1463
01:37:25,131 --> 01:37:28,999
<i>Ooh...</i>

1464
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:36,640
<i>Oh...</i>
