1
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,300
On June 21st, 1974,

2
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,200
Ricardo Morales had breakfast with
Liliana Colotto for the last tme.

3
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,500
For the rest of his life he'd remember
every sngle detai/ of that morning.

4
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,400
Planning their first vacation,

5
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,700
drinking tea with lemon
for his nagging cough,

6
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,800
with his usual lump
and a half of sugar.

7
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,900
The fresh berry jam
he'd never taste again.

8
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,100
The flowers printed
on her nightgown,

9
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,000
and especially, her smile.

10
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,900
That smile lke the sunrise

11
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,300
blending in with the sunlight
on her left cheek...

12
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,800
Please, don't...

13
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,300
Please, please...

14
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,800
"I FEAR"

15
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,700
The gates of Heaven have opened.
An angel got out.

16
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,200
- Esposito...
- Hey, baby.

17
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,300
Look what the cat dragged in.

18
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,900
How are you, Counselor?

19
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,900
And you, Lieutenant?
Is the boss here?

20
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,400
- Go right in, Your Honor.
- Thanks, Reverend.

21
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,300
You look good and rested.

22
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,400
What a fucking asshole!

23
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,900
Takes one to know one.

24
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,300
The gates have opened.

25
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,900
Your Highness.

26
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,800
What a surprise!

27
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,700
- May I?
- What brings you here?

28
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,400
Just wanted to chat.
You busy?

29
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,100
Just overpreparing for a hearing.
Coffee?

30
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,500
I'm asking in case retirement
made you healthy.

31
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,700
Mariano.

32
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,200
Yes, Your Honor.

33
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,300
Bring us two of those great coffees
from the caf.

34
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,300
I'm typing a deposition.

35
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,000
A deposition?
Meet Mr. Benjamin Esposito,

36
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,000
our recently retired royal
honoris causa,

37
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,500
and an old friend.

38
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,100
Mariano, our spring-summer intern.

39
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,000
Not bad, huh?

40
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,500
Here, bring some petit-fours
and get yourself a candy bar.

41
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,500
I'll take extra cream.

42
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,300
That's right, you're not well.

43
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,700
What was your problem again?

44
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,700
Old age?

45
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,300
Extra cream forthe man,
he has an age problem.

46
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,300
Yes, ma'am.

47
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,500
Wait. Is it important?

48
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,500
No.

49
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,300
Leave the door open, son.
Come on, sit down.

50
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,500
What do you know
about writing novels?

51
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,100
I've been writing all my life.
Take a look in the archive.

52
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,900
Oh, the case fles.

53
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,000
How many pages will your file be?

54
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,800
Does it have a cover?

55
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,800
A little encouragement
would be nice.

56
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,700
What should I do?
Act like some unwanted retiree

57
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,100
who wants to help out?
Serve coffee?

58
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,700
I want to write, so what?

59
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,100
I want to write
about the Morales case.

60
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,700
I don't know why.

61
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,600
It's been on my mind.

62
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,700
We actually nevertalked about it.
Why is that?

63
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,600
With your handwriting,
it'll be unreadable.

64
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,300
Wait, look.

65
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,100
My biggest problem
is I've started fifty times

66
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,800
and never got past the 5th line.

67
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,500
At this rate,
I'll spend my whole pension fund

68
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,900
on spiral notebooks.

69
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,300
Come here, give me a hand.

70
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,000
Here, let me.

71
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,400
I can't...

72
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,500
It weighs a ton.

73
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,500
I can't believe it.
The old Olivetti.

74
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,300
It was in storage.
I think it's 100 years old.

75
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,600
Think they fxed the "A"?

76
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,700
The "A" is for pansies.

77
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,600
Take it. Dinosaurs
have to stick together.

78
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,700
Now I'm out of excuses.

79
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,700
I'll have to write.

80
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,300
But where do I start?

81
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,700
Wherever you rememberthe most.

82
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,500
It was over 20 years ago.
Which part comes back most often?

83
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,800
That's the image
you should start with.

84
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,200
Okay, boys.
Your attention, please.

85
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,200
This is your new boss,
fresh out of Harvard.

86
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,000
Miss Irene Menendez Hastings.

87
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,700
"Hastings."

88
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,700
It's pronounced "Hastings."
It's Scottish.

89
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,900
Sorry.

90
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,100
"Hastings."

91
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,000
The new clerk.

92
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,000
Your deputy, Benjamin Esposito.

93
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,200
Actually I went to Cornell,
not Harvard.

94
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,800
Pablo Sandoval, deputy clerk,

95
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,100
your humblest servant.

96
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,300
Hey.

97
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,700
Hey.

98
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,500
Are you here?

99
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,900
Yeah.

100
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,600
No, I just...

101
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,700
I remember plenty of beginnings,

102
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,800
but I'm not sure

103
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,700
they have to do with the story.

104
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,000
Then start at the beginning
and stop dwelling on it.

105
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,000
- Blood Bank, good morning.
- Mr. Esposito.

106
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,200
- No, wrong number.
- The 25th called. A homicide.

107
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,100
Court 18. It's theirturn.

108
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,800
They said it's rape and murder.

109
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,800
Court 18.

110
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,200
Good morning.

111
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,300
Hi, fellas.

112
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,300
Good morning.

113
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,400
Ma'am, did a saint die this morning?

114
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,100
Why?

115
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,300
Because an angel in mourning
just walked in the door.

116
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,200
Oh, no.

117
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:26,100
It's a trick we angels have
to look 5 pounds lighter.

118
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,700
- Can you bring in the Chavez fle?
- Of course.

119
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,100
You smooth fucker.

120
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,300
Why?

121
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,800
Why?

122
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,000
You have a compliment ready the moment
she walks in the door. How do you do it?

123
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,400
Well, I may dress like a toad,
but I'm actually Prince Charming.

124
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,700
- Mr. Esposito.
- What?

125
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,100
Counselor Romano
told them it was ourturn.

126
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,300
Counselor Romano?

127
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,900
Tell him Sheriff Exposito
is gonna fuck him up.

128
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,900
- Okay.
- Come back here.

129
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,500
Three hours thinking of what to say,
she opens the door and...

130
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,700
I freeze up.

131
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,100
It's easier for me, I'm not in love.

132
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,000
Neither am I, moron.
Go on.

133
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,800
I want you to put the fles
on this side. All together.

134
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,300
It's simple enough.

135
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,100
Romano, what did you tell
the Precinct? It's yourturn.

136
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,000
We're alternating. We got
anothercase. What's the problem?

137
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,600
A mini-mart robbery, smart-ass.
Alternating similar cases.

138
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,900
Ask Judge Fortuna.

139
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,600
I want a solution,
not two problems.

140
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,600
Why is asking me a problem?

141
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,500
It's not that.
It just seemed silly

142
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,100
to bother you with something trivial
if we can handle it ourselves.

143
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,900
Strictly-speaking, it's yourturn.
And hurry up, or you'll fnd a wake

144
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,100
instead of a crime scene.

145
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,500
What's up, Baez?

146
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,700
Still here. And you?

147
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,300
Tired ofhappiness.

148
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,500
- You look happy.
- As a dog with two tails.

149
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,400
Ljust love it when that moron
sends me to see a dead girl.

150
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,500
Morons are a dime a dozen.

151
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,900
Quiet, easy-going ones
who know they're morons.

152
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,900
Live and let live.
They're useless but harmless.

153
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,500
- How are you, Inspector?
- Just talking about you.

154
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,700
Then there are morons
who think they're geniuses.

155
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,700
They shit everywhere
and someone has to wipe their asses.

156
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,500
Of those morons I know not one,
but two.

157
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,300
That judge and my buddy at Court 18,
who's either a moron,

158
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,900
a son of a bitch, or both.

159
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,500
It was his turn, so I'm asking you
to tell the judge.

160
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,900
Tell him I have nothing
to do with...

161
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,400
Liliana Colotto,

162
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,400
age 23, schoolteacher.

163
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,300
Recently married to...

164
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,500
Ricardo Morales,

165
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,100
bank clerk.

166
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,400
The old lady mentioned

167
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,200
two builders working
on the terrace in number 3

168
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,600
but they haven't shown in 2 days
because of rain.

169
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,600
- Sure she didn't see them?
- She says no.

170
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,800
I'll go see the husband.

171
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,600
- See you later, Esposito.
- I'll go with you.

172
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,800
Good afternoon.

173
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,800
Ricardo Morales?

174
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,800
- Ricardo Morales?
- Yes, that's me.

175
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,300
Inspector Baez, Federal Police.

176
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,700
Anyone else have a key
to your home?

177
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,900
See any strangers around
the last few days?

178
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,400
The neighbor said you came home
every day at lunchtime.

179
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,600
Out of the way, isn't it?
Any reason in particular?

180
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,000
Sorry, I didn't get that.

181
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,300
We had a habit, a routine.

182
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,500
We liked watching The Three Stooges
together.

183
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,700
She'd laugh.

184
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,400
She thought they were funny.

185
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You'll have to come with me
to the morgue.

186
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,700
We ask you to do the best you can,
I know it's an unpleasant...

187
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,300
formality.

188
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,300
Morales could stArt to contemplate
his own future.

189
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,500
He would find, no doubt,
that his future was full of nothing.

190
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,700
What's wrong with this typewriter?

191
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,000
Could you please get rid ofit?
I can't take it anymore.

192
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,700
- Who will want it?
- Just get it out of my sight.

193
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,800
Okay, Benja.
See if you like this.

194
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,800
"With this statement,

195
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,300
I, Criminal Judge
Raimundo Fortuna Lacalle,

196
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,500
hereby declare myself
completely insane

197
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,500
and incapable of carrying out
my functions."

198
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,300
That's wrong.

199
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,600
That's not right. Give it here.

200
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,600
No, it goes like this.

201
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,100
"Pursuant to articles 141,

202
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,800
142 and 143 of Civil Law,

203
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,900
MY RULING -in capital letters-

204
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,500
is that Raimundo Fortuna Lacalle

205
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,000
is mentally ill,
legally-speaking, insane,

206
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,900
suffering from chronic delirium

207
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,400
and is therefore unable to carry out
his functions as a civil servant."

208
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,900
How are things, Miss?

209
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,900
Plenty of signatures?

210
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,300
Yes. We have the Nicolosi case.

211
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,800
No big deal, Your Honor.

212
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,000
Witness statements, nothing more.

213
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,200
Very good.

214
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,700
Sorry, there's one fle left,
Your Honor.

215
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,700
Thank you.

216
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,500
Hello, Your Honor.

217
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,900
- How are you?
- Fine, you?

218
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,700
- Great.
- Benjamin. Pablo.

219
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,800
- Ma'am.
- Hello.

220
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,700
Benjamin, just to show you Court 18
is acting in good faith,

221
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,100
remember you were upset
the other day over getting a case?

222
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,100
Well, the case has been solved.

223
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,900
Two builders working in number 3.

224
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,900
They're under arrest in the 25th.

225
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,900
Whenever you have a chance,
you can bring them in

226
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,300
- and question them.
- Hold on.

227
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,600
- What builders?
- Their names are...

228
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,700
Jacinto Caceres, Bolivian,

229
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,900
35 years of age.
Juan Robles, 34.

230
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,700
At least he's Argentinean.

231
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,300
I'm blown away, Romano.

232
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,600
Keep this up and I'll give Court 18
all the hard cases.

233
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,700
- Bad news for you, son.
- Please, sir.

234
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,700
Always happy to help out.

235
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,500
Esposito, how are you?

236
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,200
Romano warn you I was coming?

237
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,500
I was typing the report.

238
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,000
You'll get the guys tomorrow.

239
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,300
- It was them, they signed a confession.
- Let me see them.

240
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,500
- Monday at the latest.
- Let me in.

241
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,200
Sergeant Sicora has to authorize it.

242
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,000
Sicora is about to eat
a plate full of shit.

243
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,000
You wanna join him?
Go right ahead.

244
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,400
Two for the price of one.

245
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,600
Well?

246
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,800
Are you Caceres?

247
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,600
No, I'm Robles.

248
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,700
He's Caceres.

249
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,300
Caceres.

250
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,200
It's okay.

251
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,900
You stupid son of a bitch!

252
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,000
Are you fucking sick or what?

253
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,500
You arrested two nobodies!
Nobodies!

254
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,900
- They weren't even there!
- Let them go!

255
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,400
What do I care?

256
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,600
You ordered it beat out of them!
Know where I'm going?

257
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,200
To fle a complaint!
We'll see

258
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,500
who saves your ass this time!

259
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,000
- Fuck your complaint!
- Don't worry,

260
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,300
you're going to.

261
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,000
All this fuss overtwo lousy blacks!

262
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,900
Your eyes'll be black
when I'm done with them!

263
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,600
- Knock it off!
- You better check the want ads.

264
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,600
You'll never set foot in here again!

265
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,700
Come on.

266
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,000
You don't know who you're
fucking with! You have no idea!

267
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,300
Benjamin.

268
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,300
- Benjamin.
- It's okay.

269
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,300
I'm going to file a complaint.
I'll be right back.

270
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,600
- Fine by me.
- I'll be right back.

271
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,400
Don't worry, I'll be right back.

272
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,000
- Did you see Sandoval?
- He left.

273
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,700
- Where?
- Down Talacahuano.

274
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,900
How can you defend this demagogue
president of ours?

275
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,100
Watch what you say,
you'll get into trouble.

276
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,700
Attention, everybody, please.

277
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,700
Chief Justice Benjamin Esposito
just walked in the door.

278
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,600
Hail, Your Honor.

279
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,700
- How much does he owe?
- Nothing.

280
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,600
I pay for my own drinks,
you know that.

281
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,300
Besides, it's early.
What's the big deal?

282
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,700
I'll pay for it, here I go.

283
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,500
- No, no.
- Take it.

284
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,500
- I have money.
- It's paid for.

285
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,000
Fine. In that case,

286
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,900
Mr. Esposito can buy
everybody a round.

287
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,200
- Thanks.
- No, no.

288
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:14,100
Hands off, hands off.
You're not my boss in here.

289
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,300
Don't embarrass me
in front of my friends, got it?

290
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,000
I'll never spot you money again.
Why do you keep screwing around?

291
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,400
Okay, okay, let's go.
Slowly, everything's fine.

292
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,900
- We're leaving.
- Come on.

293
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,100
- I'm going.
- See you later.

294
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,700
Here we go. Goodbye.

295
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,700
- My jacket.
- I've got it.

296
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,300
- See you, Emilio.
- Bye.

297
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,100
You're his wife
and this is his home.

298
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,500
You bring him at this hour,
I don't know where he's been...

299
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,900
It's early.
You should thank me.

300
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
You can't drop him off like this.
It's your problem.

301
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:51,900
My problem?

302
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,900
- You brought him like this.
- You mean it's my fault?

303
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,100
- Who is it?
- Benjamin Esposito.

304
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,100
- Who?
- From the courts, remember?

305
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,500
Pretty, wasn't she?

306
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,800
Very.

307
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,700
I really am sorry forthose guys.

308
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,300
They should be getting out by now.

309
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,800
They had to be checked by forensics

310
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,900
forthat lawsuit I mentioned.

311
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,700
No, keep looking. That way
you'll get to know her better.

312
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,200
Here's another album.

313
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,600
I look at her pictures
all day long.

314
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,100
I know I'm in denial, but...

315
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,300
it helps me go on
until we fnd the guy.

316
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,300
That's when she graduated.

317
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,100
Then she came from Chivilcoy
and moved in with her aunt.

318
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,400
She worked in a school in Almagro,

319
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,600
that's how we met.

320
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,400
She used to pay her bills
at the bank.

321
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,700
I still don't know where I got
the courage

322
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,300
to talk to such a beautiful girl.

323
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,900
Tell me one thing.

324
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,600
When we get this guy,

325
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,000
what will he get?

326
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,300
Rape and homicide.
He'll get life.

327
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,900
We don't have the death penalty.

328
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,000
I don't agree
with the death penalty.

329
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,000
Me neither. I thought maybe

330
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,500
for you it could serve as
retribution.

331
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,800
Retribution?

332
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,500
Will they rape him
and beat him to death?

333
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:12,400
No, they'll give him an injection
and he'll take a nap. It's not fair.

334
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,100
I'd gladly trade places with him.

335
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,800
Those are from when
she was 17 or 18.

336
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,700
That's the spring picnic

337
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,100
in Chivilcoy. Ever been there?

338
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,300
- No.
- I have.

339
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,600
She took me.
We visited her folks.

340
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,800
No.

341
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,700
Let him grow old.

342
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,400
Live a life full of nothing.

343
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,400
What is it?

344
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,900
No, nothing.

345
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,100
Did she have any brothers?

346
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,500
No, why?

347
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,700
- Do you know who this is?
- Let me see.

348
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,500
He's in several. Looking at her.

349
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,900
I showed Liliana this system.
Otherwise years pass and you forget

350
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,200
- who's in the photo.
- It's true.

351
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,100
Laporta, Rodriguez,
Cardoso, Simoni...

352
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,100
Here he is. Gomez.

353
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,300
Isidoro Gomez.

354
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,700
Well?

355
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,900
I always thought
the photo thing was crazy.

356
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,500
Yeah, but I think...

357
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,300
it's the look in their eyes.

358
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,900
That's the key.

359
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,100
You see this kid looking
at this woman...

360
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,100
worshipping her.

361
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,700
The eyes...

362
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,200
speak.

363
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,100
They bullshit too.

364
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,600
They should keep quiet.

365
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,300
Sometimes it's better not to look.

366
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,200
- What?
- We never talked about this case.

367
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,800
When did you come from Jujuy?

368
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,000
In '85.

369
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,900
Why now?

370
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,300
It's betterthan planting begonias.

371
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,800
Why?

372
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,300
Because I've been sidetracked
for over 20 years.

373
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,700
Courts, cases,

374
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,000
friends, pranks,

375
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,400
a marriage, several...

376
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,500
affairs...

377
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,400
I got sidetracked.

378
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,100
And now that I'm retired,
nothing sidetracks me.

379
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,400
I was in a barthe other night

380
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,600
and I saw myself

381
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,400
having dinner alone...

382
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,800
and I didn't like myself.

383
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,200
I know it doesn't happen to you.

384
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,900
I'm not asking you to understand,
but believe me.

385
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,200
And in trying to...

386
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,600
fnd the reasons,

387
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,200
the moments...

388
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,900
Everything, absolutely everything
leads me to Morales.

389
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,700
It's as if my life had...

390
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,100
- Answer it.
- It's Alfonso, I'll call him back.

391
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,000
- Answer it, I'll wait.
- I'll call him back.

392
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,100
It's no problem, answer it.

393
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,500
Hi.

394
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,600
I'm finishing up here,
I'll be right there.

395
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,400
Start without me,
I'll be right there.

396
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,400
Hello?

397
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,300
Good evenng.
Does Isidoro Gomez live there?

398
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,500
Yes.

399
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,700
Is he home?

400
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,800
No, he doesn't live here anymore.

401
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,300
- He doesn't?
- No.

402
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,200
He moved away, to Buenos Aires.

403
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,800
- Buenos Aires?
- Who's calling?

404
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,700
I'm calling on behalf of

405
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,400
Councilman Mendez,
it's about a job.

406
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,500
Has he been in Buenos Aires long?

407
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,500
A month, a little longer.

408
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,900
Do you know where I can find him?
Have you got an address?

409
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,400
This job is pretty urgent.

410
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,900
He's working on a construction site.

411
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,500
On a site?

412
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,300
Yes, he said it was...

413
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,200
It sounded like...

414
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,800
Montevideo, near Lans...

415
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,500
I don't remember very well,

416
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,300
but...

417
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,700
What type of job is it?

418
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,200
It's...

419
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,400
a job that will interest him.

420
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,000
It's for Councilman Mendez and...

421
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,000
- Tell me something.
- Yes?

422
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,300
Were he and Liliana Colotto friends?

423
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,800
Ah, Liliana Colotto...

424
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,200
They used to see each other.
She's from here.

425
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,600
Why?

426
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,600
She works forthe councilman.

427
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,300
She's the one who recommended him
for the job.

428
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,200
She did, did she?

429
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,100
He'll be glad to hear that.

430
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,700
Really? Do you think
he'll remember her?

431
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,700
Oh, yes.

432
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,700
He really lked that grl.

433
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,700
But then shemoved away...

434
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:25,600
to Buenos Aires, and they never saw
each other again.

435
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,300
Hello?

436
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,900
Hello?

437
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,000
Hello?

438
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
If he's here,

439
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,500
it's a miracle. Schmuck.

440
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:47,000
- Imagine losing the love of your life.
- Not him, you.

441
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,000
If you'd kept your mouth shut
and called me frst...

442
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,600
Morning.
We're looking for

443
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,300
Isidoro Gomez.

444
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,300
What is it?
Who are you guys?

445
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,300
Mike Hammer, asshole.

446
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,900
- Did he come to work?
- No, he didn't.

447
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,400
We know nothing about him.

448
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,800
Get me his address.

449
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,100
Right away.

450
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,100
Fernandez! Fernandez!

451
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,800
We know Gomez got a phone call
last night.

452
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,700
He went in the bedroom
and came out 10 minutes later

453
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,500
with his coat and suitcase packed.

454
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,200
The foreman says they owed him
a week's pay

455
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,600
but that he left without any fuss.

456
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,600
I can ask around if you want,
Inspector.

457
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,100
I saw the same photographs you did.

458
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,300
I should have picked him out.

459
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,100
Forget it, Esposito.
That case is nothing but hot air.

460
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:49,400
If you think I'll do all that paperwork
to issue a request in Chivilcoy

461
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,900
to search some old lady's house

462
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:54,500
to find letters the son
may or may not have sent

463
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,800
and yadda, yadda, yadda...
Please, Esposito.

464
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,400
You're nuts.

465
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,900
We have nowhere else to look, sir.

466
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:07,000
Your little game ofDon Quixote
with Romano was enough. Poor guy

467
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,100
got transferred to bumfuck, lowa.

468
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:14,400
Or maybe he's in Chivilcoy,
try asking him.

469
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,300
Anyway... the general said
what he had to.

470
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,900
Oh, well.

471
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,000
I don't know what to do.

472
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,000
Morales is getting worse every day,

473
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,100
the murderer knows we're after him,

474
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,500
my judge is a moron,

475
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,800
I want to kill Irene,

476
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,900
and the only guy I can trust
in this world

477
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,500
is a drunk,
a total fucking imbecile.

478
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,700
I have an advantage.
A small one, but an advantage.

479
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,900
Today's the 28th, right?

480
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,300
The drunk idiot hasn't got paid yet.
Last month's

481
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,200
he already drank.

482
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,700
So when it's time to pay the bill,

483
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,700
he'll have a dilemma.

484
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,600
Either he says he's broke,
gets arrested, beat up,

485
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,900
goes home a mess and his wife
kicks him out for good,

486
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:31,000
or he turns to his boss the chump,
who happens to be me,

487
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,400
and asks him to pay it.

488
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,900
But one thing.

489
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,800
Since his boss is a chump,
but not a complete chump,

490
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,100
he'll pay this one last time.

491
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,800
But in exchange for a favor.

492
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,500
And the drunk idiot can't say no.

493
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,900
Isn't that right?

494
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,400
I gotta pee.

495
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,100
Hold on.

496
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
The old lady has to come out
at some point.

497
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,300
Too much Napoleon Solo
and Perry Mason. That's your problem.

498
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,100
I'm serious, I gotta take a leak.

499
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,100
Son of a bitch!

500
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,700
Damn you! Damn you!

501
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,900
You scared the fucking crap
out of me!

502
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:52,000
I scared you?
What are you doing here?

503
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,900
I came to help you.

504
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,600
You're supposed to keep watch outside.
If she comes back, we're screwed.

505
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,300
- She ain't coming back.
- How do you know?

506
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,000
She's in the grocery store,
she'll be a while.

507
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,500
Calm down, for God's sake.

508
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,900
Did you find anything?

509
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,500
The letters.

510
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,000
The letters, but no...
Come here.

511
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,500
There's no address.

512
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,100
The envelopes are gone.
There's no address.

513
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,900
- This one's from the other day.
- So?

514
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,600
It's recent.

515
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,000
The trash. The envelopes
may still be in the trash.

516
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,200
Go check.

517
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,400
No, nothing here.

518
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,600
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

519
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,100
Did you go through it?

520
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,300
- You wanna try?
- Knock it off.

521
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,900
What is it?

522
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,500
Go on, go on.

523
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,900
What is it? What?

524
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:08,000
Come here.
Calm down, I'll let you out.

525
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,300
Wait, wait.

526
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,600
Want me to drive?

527
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,300
The dog probably had rabies,
you're gonna die.

528
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:33,100
Why didn't you keep watch?
If she fnds out we broke in...

529
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,400
Benjamin, as soon as
we came forthe letters,

530
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,800
sooner or later she'd realize.

531
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
That's why we didn't take
the letters.

532
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,100
You weren't stupid enough
to bring them, were you?

533
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,100
And what ifl did?

534
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,400
What if? What if?

535
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:00,600
If she finds out, she'll tell Gomez
and the guy will disappear for good.

536
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,100
- Don't you see?
- No.

537
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,400
You don't?
You're fucking blind!

538
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,500
Because you...

539
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:10,100
You'll see, when I fnally figure out
the whole thing out about the date...

540
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,900
I'd much rather work alone!

541
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,200
Dammit...

542
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,700
Tactical Revolutionary Command,
may I help you?

543
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,500
Wrong number.

544
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,200
That's quite all right.

545
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,100
Nothing at all?

546
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,300
Or I'm missing something.

547
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:37,200
It's like the guy knew
we were going to read the letters.

548
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,700
It's just names.

549
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,500
Bullshit, nothing concrete.

550
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,500
Look.

551
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,300
"Don't worry about me.

552
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:50,100
I'm like Manfredini, not Bavastro."

553
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,100
People from Chivilcoy.

554
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,200
Here, let me see.
Oh, shit...

555
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,700
Sperm Bank, loan department.
Good morning.

556
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,100
No, it's a sperm bank.
Deposit or withdrawal?

557
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,500
- Esposito. Sandoval.
- Wrong number.

558
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,700
Sandoval.

559
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,700
Judge Fortuna wants to see you.

560
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,700
You hear my voice when I speak
to you, don't you, Esposito?

561
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,000
Yes, sir.

562
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,200
Then I have to assume
that ifl tell you something

563
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,600
and you do exactly the opposite,

564
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,300
it's not that you didn't hear me

565
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,700
but that you could give a flying fuck
about the order I gave you.

566
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,200
Isn't that right, Esposito?

567
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,200
Not quite like that, sir.

568
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,300
And if my colleague from Chivilcoy
calls me

569
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,900
very angry to tell me
that two of my employees

570
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,300
broke into some poor
old lady's house,

571
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,500
that means what I say isn't worth
a bucket of shit.

572
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:52,200
I don't know where your colleague
could have heard such a thing.

573
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,100
That's exactly what I told him,
Esposito.

574
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,600
However, my colleague tells me

575
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,300
that the other day

576
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,600
in Chivilcoy

577
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,300
at the intersection

578
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:11,300
ofFranciso Savey
and the corner of Schiaffino

579
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:16,300
in the city limits of Chivilcoy
a black Peugeot was parked

580
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:21,600
with a Buenos Aires license plate
number 133-809,

581
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,700
and my colleague asks
the Federal Police

582
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,800
to run a background check
on the vehicle.

583
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:31,600
Guess whose name the car
is registered to?

584
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,800
Tell me, who?

585
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,400
Someone named Es...

586
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,600
Es-po...

587
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,400
Es-po-si...

588
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,400
...to?

589
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
And the Federal Police

590
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,600
tell him where he works.

591
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,100
And the judge calls me

592
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:09,500
to see if I can clear things up.
And the truth is, Esposito, I can't.

593
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,300
Because I don't look like
a judge anymore,

594
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,000
I look like a frst class
fucking idiot.

595
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:18,900
Because I say I want A
and I people give me Z.

596
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:23,000
Just like this piece of shit
typewriterthey gave me!

597
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,800
Excuse me, sir, but...

598
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:32,000
I think something weird
is going on here.

599
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,200
Exactly. Wait, wait.

600
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,500
Wait a minute.
You ain't heard nothing yet.

601
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:40,000
After you can go right back
to treating me like a fucking idiot.

602
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,200
But listen to this.

603
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,400
Because what stood out most
in that little town

604
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,300
wasn't the two guys
from Buenos Aires, no.

605
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,300
Orthat one of them was seen

606
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,700
tying his shoelaces
when he was wearing loafers.

607
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:01,700
What stood out most was that one
of them walked into the grocery store,

608
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,800
greeted them pleasantly,

609
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:09,300
asked for a bottle of whisky and left
drinking straight from the bottle.

610
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,000
Shall I describe him for you?

611
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,100
We have to deny it, Benjamin.

612
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,200
"It wasn't me, I don't know..."

613
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:20,000
Don't evertalk to me again.
Never again.

614
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,300
- Deny everything.
- Never again.

615
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,700
- Ma'am, honestly...
- Get out of my sight.

616
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,800
Are you against us too?

617
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,200
Irene, I'm talking to you.
Irene!

618
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:37,200
Not only was it a stupid move,
but you did it behind my back.

619
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,800
- I didn't think...
- You think I'm here to joke around.

620
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,000
I didn't say that.

621
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,200
You didn't need to. I can tell.
Let's get this straight.

622
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:47,000
I'm the boss and you're
the employee.

623
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,900
Twelve letters.
31 pages on thin paper.

624
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,200
He mentions 5 jobs,
two as a builder,

625
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,500
one delivering groceries,
two without details.

626
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:05,900
Three neighborhoods in Buenos Aires:
Monte Grande, San Justo and Avellaneda.

627
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,800
Six names:

628
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,800
Anido, Mesias, Oleniak,

629
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:12,600
Manfredini, Bavastro and Sanchez.

630
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,800
Only one reference to a woman:
Rosa, apparently an aunt.

631
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,400
That's it. That's all I've got.
The rest is nothing.

632
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,700
- Benjamin.
- This is nothing too?

633
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,100
Please.

634
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,800
Leave it open, it isn't private.

635
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,100
I talked to Fortuna.

636
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,700
I explained that you're an imbecile.

637
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,100
I used my irresistible smile

638
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:49,300
and convinced him to call thejudge
in Chivilcoy and forget the whole thing.

639
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,700
I don't know how to thank you.

640
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,000
I ask that you refrain
from such actions in the future.

641
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,000
You're free to go.

642
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,100
One question, if I may.

643
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:03,400
Which irresistible smile?
I don't think I've seen it.

644
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:07,600
Of course not. I save it
for my boyfriend, as I should.

645
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,200
Of course.

646
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,100
Right.

647
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,900
I won't take any more of yourtime.

648
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,400
And bring me the Liliana Colotto file,
to seal it and archive it.

649
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,900
The case is closed.

650
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:38,100
Getting engaged.
Kids today laugh at it.

651
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,900
Who gets engaged anymore?

652
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,800
And this kid? What was his name?
He was here less than a year...

653
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,300
- Godoy.
- Godoy.

654
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,100
- Larreta got him the job.
- That's right.

655
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,400
- Remember?
- Yes.

656
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,700
Silly me, I didn't put a date
on the photo.

657
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,400
When was it? Two orthree months
after Chivilcoy.

658
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,100
Aweek later.
I remember perfectly.

659
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,600
Aweek after we fought you showed up
with Alfonso whatever his name was

660
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,400
to announce your engagement.

661
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:10,100
Look at Sandoval,
trying to look sober.

662
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,700
Poor Pablo.

663
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,700
It's so weird,
I don't even recognize myself.

664
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,700
I look like somebody else.

665
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,200
Who were you?

666
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,700
What were you like?

667
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:24,800
I don't know.

668
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,800
Straight, conservative...

669
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,300
Stuck-up.

670
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,800
- Structured.
- Inflexible.

671
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:33,900
Young.

672
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,600
Young, Benjamin. I was young.

673
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:41,100
You were young, too.
Look, no gray hair.

674
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,400
And here, looking to the side,
all serious.

675
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:53,600
I was another person.

676
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,100
Your novel might be really good.

677
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,200
But it's not for me.

678
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:18,700
You've reached the end of your life
and you want to look back.

679
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,100
But I can't.

680
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,300
I have to go to work every day.

681
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:29,100
And live with this.
It may not be "The" Justice,

682
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,000
but it's "some" justice.

683
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:35,300
And at the end of the day
I have to go home

684
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,500
and live with my husband...

685
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,200
and with my children,
who I adore.

686
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,500
My whole life I've looked forward.

687
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,200
"Backwards" is out
of my jurisdiction.

688
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,100
I declare myselfincompetent.

689
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,300
What a case, Jesus Christ.

690
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,200
It never dies.

691
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:41,700
Morales.

692
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,800
- Morales.
- Hello.

693
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,100
- How are things?
- And you?

694
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,500
- Esposito.
- Of course. How are you?

695
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,300
Fine, and you?

696
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:51,700
Here I am.

697
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:54,200
Would you like to sit?

698
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:55,400
Yes.

699
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:01,700
How are things?

700
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,300
This month I'm here
Tuesdays and Thursdays.

701
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:05,900
What?

702
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:07,700
In this station.

703
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:11,100
The other days of the week
I wait in the other stations.

704
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,100
I change it every month.

705
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,100
He'll have to come through
eventually.

706
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:21,600
He must live out of town,
he knows in the city he'd be caught.

707
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:28,400
It's been a year but I imagine
you haven't stopped investigating.

708
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,500
No, no.

709
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,800
You must think I'm crazy.

710
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:39,400
No.

711
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,600
Don't worry about me, please.

712
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,400
No, I won't.

713
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:50,700
The worst part is
I'm starting to forget.

714
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:54,700
I have to constantly make myself
remember her.

715
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,400
The day she was killed,

716
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,700
Liliana made me tea with lemon.

717
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:06,100
I'd been coughing all night
and she said it would help.

718
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:10,700
I remember those stupid things.

719
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,300
Then I start having doubts

720
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,500
and I don't remember if it was lemon
or honey in the tea.

721
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:24,300
And I don't know if it's a memory or
a memory of a memory I'm left with.

722
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:38,800
Excuse me.

723
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,100
I need to talk to you.

724
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,200
Come in.

725
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,100
Thank you.

726
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,900
Something happened to me
yesterday.

727
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,800
I was up all night
thinking about it.

728
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,100
I thought about you...
Have you ever...

729
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,700
have you ever seen

730
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,800
things from a different angle?

731
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,500
You see someone else

732
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:11,500
and what the other person is going
through helps you see your own life.

733
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:16,300
- Go on.
- Yes.

734
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,200
And I thought,

735
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,500
"I have to talk to Irene."

736
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,300
You might get pissed at me...
Sorry.

737
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:27,100
You might want to kill me, but...

738
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,700
I have to give it a try.

739
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:34,000
Wait a moment while
I close the door.

740
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:40,400
Sandoval, I'm busy.
I'll call you when I'm done.

741
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,100
Benjamn asked me to come.

742
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,100
Yes, I was hoping the three of us
could talk.

743
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:47,100
Excuse me, ma'am.

744
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:59,800
I ran into Morales yesterday
at the train station.

745
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,300
Know what he was doing?

746
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,500
My crystal ball is broken.

747
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:10,600
He goes to the terminals every day
looking forthe killer.

748
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,700
Every single day after working
at the bank.

749
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,700
You can't imagine his love.

750
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:18,700
It's touching.

751
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:25,200
It's as if his wife's death
just left him there,

752
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,400
stuck in time forever.

753
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,200
You should see his eyes.

754
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,400
They're in a state of pure love.

755
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:38,700
Can you imagine a love like that?

756
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:42,200
Unaffected by the wear and tear
of the routine?

757
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,600
Speak for yourself,
it doesn't affect mine.

758
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:54,000
We think the guy

759
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,600
deserves another chance, ma'am.

760
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,100
Where do I come in?

761
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,200
The case is closed.

762
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,900
We'd have to reopen it.

763
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,100
You're asking me to destroy
an offcial document,

764
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:10,500
with mine and the judge's
signature on it...

765
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,200
and to falsify statements and dates

766
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,100
so it will look like the case
is still open?

767
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:19,000
- That's a brilliant idea. We hadn't...
- Don't fuck with me.

768
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,800
Everything okay, sir?

769
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,900
Tell me.

770
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:54,900
Did you see a stack of letters
on my desk?

771
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,100
No.

772
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,000
Sandoval?

773
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:01,000
He left down Talcahuano.

774
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,300
Not only do you sneak off to get
drunk, you also steal evidence.

775
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,000
Everything's under control.

776
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,600
Iflrene reads the file...

777
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,400
Hands off. Are you nuts?

778
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,900
- We're going back.
- Sit down for a second.

779
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,200
Sit down and take it easy.

780
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,100
Know why we can't fnd him,

781
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,400
Benjamin?

782
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,600
Because we're stupid.

783
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,600
Look: "Twelve letters.

784
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:39,400
31 pages. Five jobs..."

785
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,000
- I already read you this part.
- Can we go?

786
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:45,900
Hold on a second.
My mind exploded, I couldn't stop.

787
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,700
I kept asking myself,
"Why can't we fnd this guy?"

788
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:52,000
He always vanishes.
Where is he?

789
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,100
And I started thinking about guys.

790
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:02,300
Guys in general.
Not just this guy, but...

791
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,000
Guys in general.

792
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,300
"The" guy.

793
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:12,000
The guy can do anything
to be different.

794
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,500
But there's one thing he can't change.
Not him, not you, not anybody.

795
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,400
Take me, for example.

796
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,600
I'm young,

797
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:24,700
I have a good job,
a wife who loves me...

798
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,100
And like you always say,

799
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:30,300
I keep throwing my life away
in dives like this.

800
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,600
Many times you've asked,
"Why are you here, Pablo?"

801
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:37,100
You know why, Benjamin?

802
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,700
Because it's my passion.

803
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,700
I love coming here,

804
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,800
getting drunk,

805
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,900
slugging it out with anyone
who pisses me off.

806
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:50,100
I love it.

807
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,500
Just like you, Benjamin.

808
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:58,800
There's nothing you can do
to get Irene out of your head.

809
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,700
She's dying to marry someone else,

810
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:07,200
her desk drawer is full of
wedding dress magazines.

811
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:10,400
She got engaged, had a party,
everything.

812
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,000
But you...

813
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:15,200
you keep waiting forthe miracle,
Benjamin.

814
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:17,500
Why?

815
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:19,500
Come here.

816
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:21,300
How's it going, notary?

817
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:22,900
- Hey, there.
- How are you?

818
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,700
This is that friend I mentioned.
Esposito, Andretta the notary.

819
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:28,800
A real notary,
and my tech advisor.

820
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,200
Here's my card.

821
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:33,100
Let's begin with the frst letter
from our friend Gomez.

822
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:34,800
It's okay, keep it.

823
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,700
"I swear it rained so hard

824
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:39,400
I looked worse than Oleniak
that night."

825
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:42,000
- Notary, please.
- Juan Carlos Oleniak.

826
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:44,900
First played for Racing Academy
in '60. In '62

827
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,800
he went to Argentino Juniors,
and back to Racing in '63.

828
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,500
In a classic match
with San Lorenzo

829
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:54,000
he got pushed and fell face-first
into the ditch.

830
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:55,500
He was soaked.

831
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:59,700
We call him Plato.
The Academy is his life.

832
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:03,100
"I'll send for you.
We make a great team.

833
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:06,800
Anido by himself isn't the same
as Anido with Mesias."

834
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:10,200
Anido and Mesias, backs on the club
that won it all in '61.

835
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:11,900
Negri at goalie, Anido and Mesias.

836
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Blanco, Peano and Sacchi.
Corbatta, Pizzuti,

837
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,800
Mansilla, Sosa and Belen.

838
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:21,000
"Don't worry about me.
I'm like Manfredini,

839
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:22,900
not Bavastro." Notary?

840
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:25,200
Pedro Waldemar Manfredini.

841
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:29,300
Racing paid peanuts for him
and he ended up being

842
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:32,700
an extraordinary player.
Incredible.

843
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:35,500
Julio Bavastro, right forward.

844
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:39,300
Played only two matches
between '62 and '63 without scoring.

845
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,700
Quote: "I don't want
to end up like Sanchez."

846
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:43,500
Who's he talking about?

847
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:47,800
He can only mean the goalie,
Ataulfo Sanchez.

848
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:49,600
Eternal benchwarmer.

849
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:54,100
He played only 17 matches
between '57 and '61.

850
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,500
Notary, what is Racing to you?

851
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,200
A passion.

852
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,300
Even after 9 years
without a championship?

853
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,100
A passion is a passion.

854
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:03,800
You see, Benjamin?

855
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:08,500
A guy can change anything.
His face, his home, his family,

856
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:13,300
his girlfriend, his religion,
his God.

857
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:16,400
But there's one thing
he can't change.

858
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,800
He can't change...

859
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:19,200
his passion.

860
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:25,100
It's a beautiful night for soccer.

861
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:30,000
Huracn hosts Avellaneda's
Racing Club at Tomas Duco Stadium

862
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:33,300
on a splendid night for soccer.

863
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:37,100
Racing has slipped in the standings

864
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:41,700
and can't waste
this final opportunity

865
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:44,400
to stay in the race
for the championship.

866
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,600
Jorge has the ball.
He blows by Brindisi.

867
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:51,400
Greatmove.
He heads down the left sideline.

868
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,600
He shakes Houseman perfectly.

869
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,700
Centers deep to Nestor Escola.

870
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:59,000
Over to Roberto Diaz.
Diaz kicks with his left...

871
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:03,100
He hits the bar! Incredible!
Hurcn gets away with one!

872
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,700
A spectacular first possession!
Racing almost scored first.

873
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:13,100
Academy! Academy! Academy!

874
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:40,000
This is madness. It's chaos.

875
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:44,100
You just don't know soccer. You have
to be a little more patient.

876
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:46,700
There's too many people.
It's impossible.

877
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,500
There he is!

878
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,700
- Overthere!
- Where?

879
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,500
- There!
- Where? I don't see him.

880
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:03,000
Excuse me. Pardon me.

881
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:15,000
Isidoro Gomez.

882
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:20,100
- Sorry.
- Come on, let's go.

883
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,500
What's wrong, Benjamin?

884
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:27,700
I'm sick of this. It's been a month.
We've been to 4 matches!

885
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,400
I said to be patient.

886
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:02,900
Damn it...
Gomez! Come back here!

887
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:06,500
Come back here!
Don't run! Come back!

888
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:08,900
Come back!

889
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:15,500
You guys, come on!

890
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:18,100
Benjamin, hurry up, please!

891
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,200
I had him and he got away!

892
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,800
Where's Baez?

893
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:25,500
Baez! Baez!
He ran off, did you see him?

894
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:26,600
What's he look like?

895
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:28,400
- I gave you the photo!
- I mean how tall is he?

896
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:32,700
Medium-height, skinny... What are
they doing? He's getting away!

897
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:37,500
I can't take it, Benjamin.
What's he look like, he asks!

898
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:40,400
- He should have been there, not us!
- He doesn't know him, we do!

899
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,100
Why didn't you give him the photo?

900
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:45,100
Go to hell, you motherfucker!

901
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:01,100
Can't I take a crap in peace?

902
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:06,900
Come out!

903
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:08,700
Fuck off! It's occupied!

904
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:12,700
Come on out, the cops are here.
Nothing will happen to you.

905
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:15,000
What police?
Quit fucking around.

906
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:16,900
Pablo!

907
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:28,100
Sorry. How's it going?

908
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:30,000
- I'm waiting for Sandoval.
- What for?

909
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:32,400
I play the nice guy,
then he comes in...

910
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,500
I'll explain later,
it's a routine we have.

911
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,900
Oldest trick in the book. You can't
question him without thejudge.

912
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,500
Actually, we have to pull it off
before he gets here.

913
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:43,800
Questioning a prisoner
with no lawyer or judge?

914
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Ordoez! You seen Sandoval?

915
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:48,800
- He left a while ago.
- Damn it.

916
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:51,100
It won't stand up.
What will you charge him with?

917
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,900
What do you mean?
You think it's little to go on?

918
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:57,000
Looking at the victim in a photo?
Yes, it is.

919
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:59,000
That's why we have to soften him up.

920
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:00,300
What if it's not him?

921
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,300
- Don't look at me like that.
- Eduardo!

922
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:03,800
- What ifit's not him?
- Of course it is.

923
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:06,800
- Yes, Counselor?
- Don't call me that. Go get Sandoval.

924
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,200
- Should I take a taxi?
- Yes. No, no.

925
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:12,000
He goes to Robertino's
in the morning.

926
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:14,100
No. Wait, Eduardo.

927
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:16,300
What are you doing?

928
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:17,100
Sorry, sorry.

929
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,200
It's him.

930
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:21,100
- How do you know?
- I don't know.

931
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:24,300
- See?
- I don't know how I know, but I know.

932
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:25,100
How?

933
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,700
Gomez, Isidoro Nestor.

934
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,300
I.D. Number.

935
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:41,700
10,740,925.

936
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:44,300
- Marital status?
- Single.

937
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:46,600
Address?

938
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:49,400
Mocoret 2428, Isidro Casanova.

939
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,400
What train do you take into town?

940
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:58,800
What train do you take into town?

941
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:01,900
I don't take the train.
I take the bus.

942
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:09,900
What's the problem?

943
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:14,900
Mo...

944
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:16,900
core...

945
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:20,500
This typewriter is no good.

946
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:24,900
The "A" doesn't work.

947
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:27,700
Wait, hold on.

948
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:30,700
What is this about?

949
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:33,700
Please, I beg you.

950
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:43,100
You're implicated in the Liliana
Colotto case, rape and homicide.

951
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:46,600
It happened on June 21st, 1974.

952
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:48,700
Actually, you're the accused.

953
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:51,200
I'm going to take your statement.

954
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:55,900
- You'll be assigned a public defender.
- Wait, wait, wait.

955
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:58,100
Liliana Colotto?

956
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:02,400
I knew her back in Chivilcoy.

957
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,500
What happened to her?

958
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:08,100
Tell me, Gomez.

959
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:10,400
Why do you think you've spent 3 days

960
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:11,900
behind bars?

961
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:14,300
I have no idea.
I was at the match...

962
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,900
- Yeah, and you took off running.
- What would you do?

963
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,500
Two crazy-looking guys suddenly
jump you... What happened to Liliana?

964
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,200
Look, Gomez, don't...

965
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:26,000
You know as well as I do
you raped and killed her.

966
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,000
Liliana?

967
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:30,200
Are you serious?
I would never do that.

968
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:33,000
I haven't set foot in Chivilcoy
in over a year, I can prove it.

969
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:35,300
We looked for you
a week afterthe homicide

970
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:37,700
and you disappeared,
from a hostal and a job.

971
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:40,300
What hostal?
I never left any hostal.

972
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:43,000
Gomez, don't play dumb.

973
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,900
- The hostal on Piedras.
- That was a year ago!

974
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:49,000
I left because I couldn't afford it.

975
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:52,100
- And your job?
- I found one that paid better.

976
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:54,300
What's that got to do with Liliana?

977
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:56,200
I've known her my whole life,

978
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:58,700
she's a friend from my childhood.

979
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,000
They can't find Sandoval.

980
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,300
- What?
- They can't fnd Sandoval.

981
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:24,000
Okay, let me think...

982
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:26,600
Listen.

983
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:30,300
Fortuna should be here any minute.
Please, wait for him.

984
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:32,000
Please, wait for him.

985
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:36,000
Yes, you could...

986
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:39,300
You could be right.

987
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:41,000
It might be preferable...

988
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,700
more practical...
Let me see, one second.

989
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:55,700
Look, Gomez.

990
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:58,900
The judge handling your case

991
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:03,400
will be here soon,
so we're going to wait for him.

992
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,100
Ma'am?

993
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:08,900
Sorry to interrupt, deputy,
I mean, Counselor.

994
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,200
I know you're handling this case.

995
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:13,000
But...

996
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:17,500
this kid couldn't have done it.

997
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:21,800
We'll talk outside.

998
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:24,500
Wait, just a minute.
Look at him.

999
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,600
This kid couldn't have done it.

1000
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:32,700
Let me see the autopsy.

1001
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:37,400
The Colotto girl...

1002
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:40,500
Here she is. 5 feet 6,

1003
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,600
128 pounds.

1004
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:44,500
Look what he did to her.

1005
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:47,300
I'm sorry, Gomez.

1006
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:49,600
But I don't buy it.

1007
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:51,900
The Amazon and the Pigmy?

1008
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,500
Besides, she was a beautiful woman.

1009
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,200
Please,

1010
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:03,100
look at this face.

1011
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,100
A beauty like her
isn't within just anyone's reach.

1012
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:11,000
It takes a real man
to hook a woman like that.

1013
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,700
You think so?

1014
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:17,600
I mean...

1015
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:21,700
The door wasn't forced.

1016
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,900
That means she knew her assailant.

1017
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:27,800
Yes.

1018
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:32,700
But there's no way such a woman
would ever remember this twinkie.

1019
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,900
Unless she was a hooker.

1020
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:37,500
Some guys you only do for money.

1021
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:39,200
Who is she?

1022
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:41,000
Keep your fucking mouth shut.

1023
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:46,900
No, she was a decent girl,
I assure you.

1024
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
I agree with the kid about that.

1025
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,700
She was two-timing that bank clerk
for sure.

1026
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:58,600
I'll bet his horns were so big
he needed a convertible.

1027
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:01,100
What are you laughing at,
retard?

1028
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:04,500
That guy who gave testimony
last time.

1029
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:07,700
- Sandoval?
- Right. I bet it was him.

1030
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:11,700
He was her lover.
Tall, good-looking, broad shoulders.

1031
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:14,900
A man truly capable of
warming up a woman.

1032
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:16,600
Look at this pussy.

1033
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:21,200
I'll bet when she saw him
she thought,

1034
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:24,000
"Oh, no, it's that schmuck
who always makes

1035
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:26,100
mushy faces in all the photos."

1036
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:27,700
Isn't that right?

1037
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:33,100
Yes or no?

1038
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:43,500
I caught you, motherfucker!

1039
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,500
Get him out ofhere!

1040
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:48,100
I caught you!

1041
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:52,500
Take him away, please.

1042
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:14,300
You people are crazy.

1043
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,200
You're crazy.

1044
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:22,700
Listen, Benjamin.

1045
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:27,200
"The damage to the right
parietal bone

1046
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:31,500
demonstrates the assailant had
extraordinary upper body strength."

1047
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:34,000
Look.

1048
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:36,200
Two noodles.

1049
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:43,200
"Likewise, due to the depth
of her vaginal injuries,

1050
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:47,500
we may deduce that the assailant
was very well-endowed."

1051
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:52,300
Obviously they're not talking about
this microbe. He must have a peanut.

1052
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:10,500
There it is, bitch.

1053
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:12,400
How do you like it?

1054
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,100
Sweetheart,

1055
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:29,600
you'll never reach the piata.
First, you're too short.

1056
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:32,700
Second, you're not man enough
for a real woman like me.

1057
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,500
Not man enough?

1058
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:35,500
Fucking bitch!

1059
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:38,500
I fucked the shit out of her!
I fucked the shit out of her!

1060
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:39,800
That bitch!

1061
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:42,900
I fucked her brains out!

1062
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,400
Stop, stop, let him go...

1063
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:48,500
Let him go, Benjamin.

1064
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,100
Let go of me!

1065
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:52,600
Touch her and I'll kill you.
I'll kill you!

1066
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,100
Let go of me!

1067
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:47,400
Are you Esposito?

1068
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:52,300
Are you Esposito or not?

1069
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:06,700
- Hello?
- Hi, it's me. Did I wake you?

1070
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:08,900
No, I was...

1071
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:12,000
working a bit.
Why are you up so late?

1072
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:14,300
I was thinking...

1073
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:16,800
- You don't say.
- Yeah, silly.

1074
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,200
No, about the novel.

1075
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,700
I want to read t when
it's finished.

1076
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:25,300
Great, I'd love that.

1077
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,900
Sure you don't want to talk
a little while?

1078
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:32,200
No, I'll drink my tea
and see if I can get back to sleep.

1079
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:33,900
Okay.

1080
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:35,600
- Bye.
- Bye.

1081
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,700
Irene, the dressmaker is here.

1082
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:48,000
Look, she made the cape
like you wanted.

1083
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:49,500
Come and try it on.

1084
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:51,200
I'll be right in.

1085
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:25,700
Hello?

1086
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:29,200
Morales, how are you?
It's been ages, what a surprise!

1087
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:34,400
Yeah, I'm watching it,
but I turned it down.

1088
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:36,700
What?

1089
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:39,900
What?

1090
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:49,400
And also, thanks to them,
we can achieve

1091
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:52,500
many things, because people
can't do it all on their own.

1092
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:07,000
Good morning. Miss Menendez Hastings
from Court 42.

1093
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:08,900
We're here to see Mr. Romano.

1094
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:11,600
He's very busy.
What's it about?

1095
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:14,600
Sir! Sir! You can't go in there!

1096
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:16,800
I'll leave my credentials,
don't worry.

1097
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,900
These two, raising their hands.
I want you to get them.

1098
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:22,300
What are you doing here?
Are you crazy?

1099
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:24,000
No, you are.

1100
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:26,700
- Ma'am.
- We need to talk to you.

1101
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:28,700
Fellas, would you mind?

1102
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,900
If you'd called first,
I'd have had coffee ready.

1103
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:42,000
Isidoro Gomez. Rape and murder,
arrested by the court.

1104
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:43,800
Penitentiaries informed us

1105
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,500
he's been freed by Executive Order.
We checked...

1106
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:48,700
and here we are.
Anything to say?

1107
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:51,200
Yeah, sure. That you two
need to get out more.

1108
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:55,100
Justice is nothing but an island.
This is the real world.

1109
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:58,400
While you two are shooting birds,
we're in here,

1110
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:00,700
fighting in the middle
of thejungle.

1111
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:04,700
Gomez, Gomez, Gomez...
Yes.

1112
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:07,600
He started working for us
when he was in jail.

1113
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:10,500
He'd give us information,
spy on young guerrillas...

1114
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:12,700
He did good work.
We like him.

1115
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:14,100
What's the problem?

1116
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:19,300
Do you realize what you're saying?
He confessed. He's a convicted

1117
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:20,400
murderer.

1118
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:23,500
Perhaps, but he's also
intelligent and brave.

1119
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:26,100
He can break into a home
and get the job done.

1120
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:29,500
His personal life
is his own business, right?

1121
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:32,300
With all the subversives
out there... Who cares?

1122
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:34,500
If we only used good guys...

1123
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:41,800
He was arrested under
Judge Fortuna's jurisdiction...

1124
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:45,400
Do you think I don't know you let
him go to get back at me?

1125
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:46,800
You think I'm stupid?

1126
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:50,800
That's two questions.
Which one shall I answer frst?

1127
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,200
- Is that true?
- Ma'am...

1128
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:56,100
Would you do me a favor?

1129
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:57,500
Stay out of it.

1130
01:17:58,100 --> 01:18:00,200
What are you gonna do,
file an appeal?

1131
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,400
No offense, but there's nothing
you can do.

1132
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:06,100
Except go back to your office,
take a seat, and watch and learn.

1133
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:08,500
They don't teach the new Argentina
at Harvard.

1134
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:14,100
And why do you come with her?

1135
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:16,700
You think it gives you immunity?

1136
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:20,300
Leave her alone,
she's out of your league.

1137
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:24,700
She studied law, you barely finished
high school. She's young, you're old.

1138
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,800
She's rich, you're poor.

1139
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:28,700
She's Menendez Hastings

1140
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:30,800
and you're Esposito, a zero.

1141
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,600
She's untouchable, you aren't.

1142
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:37,600
Let her go back to her world.

1143
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,600
But if you have a problem with me,

1144
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:43,800
come alone and we'll settle it.

1145
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:50,200
Come on, Irene.

1146
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:53,000
Let's go.

1147
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,400
You do have one thing in common.

1148
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:01,600
Neither of you
can do a thing about it.

1149
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:24,000
You said life.

1150
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:28,300
Yes, he should get life.

1151
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,000
Well, then?

1152
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:35,700
These people don't give a shit
about justice.

1153
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:41,000
And where he is now,
we can't get anywhere near him.

1154
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:47,000
Ifl could, what for?

1155
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:50,400
What would I do?
What would four bullets get me?

1156
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:52,300
A lifetime in jail.

1157
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:56,800
Gomez goes free without ever serving
and I spend 50 years

1158
01:20:56,900 --> 01:20:59,900
stuck in a cell, envying him.

1159
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:02,700
No.

1160
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,200
No, life in prison
would have been fair.

1161
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:14,700
I wish I could help,
but I honestly don't know how.

1162
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:19,800
Who knows?

1163
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:22,400
Some othertime...

1164
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:28,700
Anyway.

1165
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:30,900
- I'll get it.
- No, please.

1166
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:32,200
It's just a coffee.

1167
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:39,300
I'm very grateful for everything
you've done for me.

1168
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:42,600
I wouldn't have made it this far
without you.

1169
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:45,900
I owe you one.

1170
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:17,600
Counselor, sir.
It's about the lgarzabal fle, sir.

1171
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:20,600
Stop calling me Counselor,
would you already?

1172
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:23,300
If you do it in front of the judge
I'll get in trouble.

1173
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:24,700
What about the fle?

1174
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,700
- Have you made a copy?
- I'm on it.

1175
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:27,600
No, you aren't.

1176
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:30,500
You'd have to be there,
but you're here.

1177
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:35,600
Benjamin.

1178
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:39,900
Yes?

1179
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:44,600
How long before
you talk to me again?

1180
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,500
I talk to you every day.

1181
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:51,000
I'm not untouchable.

1182
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:55,100
- Or from another world.
- Lf only you were...

1183
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:59,100
- Irene, let's drop it.
- Drop what?

1184
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:02,000
You're marrying the engineer,
Zapiola

1185
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:04,700
Menendez Urtubiea and so on.

1186
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:08,500
You're notjealous...

1187
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:13,400
For God's sake.
I hope you live happily ever after.

1188
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:15,500
- Any objections?
- No, none.

1189
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:16,700
Go on, object.

1190
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:19,900
Irene,

1191
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:21,400
please.

1192
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:24,700
What are you looking at?
What do you want? Go away.

1193
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:25,900
Come on.

1194
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:30,700
- Where can we meet?
- What for?

1195
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:34,100
So you can present your objections
about my life, my fanc,

1196
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:36,600
my marriage and anything else
related to the case.

1197
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:42,300
We can meet for coffee after work.

1198
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:44,200
Time?

1199
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:49,400
Eight-thirty. Place?

1200
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:51,500
- The lmmortals.
- The Richmond.

1201
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:55,100
Sorry. My suggestion
wasn't very elegant.

1202
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:58,600
No, Benjamin.
Somewhere far from here.

1203
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:04,900
Who are you spying on?

1204
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:08,200
Sorry. Phone call for you, sir.
From a bar?

1205
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:13,200
Pablo Sandoval.
You cocksucking bastard.

1206
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:14,900
Wash your fucking mouth!

1207
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:19,000
No, Benjamin...
I can't believe they called you.

1208
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:20,100
What happened?

1209
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:22,800
I told everyone
not to bother my friend.

1210
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,500
This is a man'sjob!

1211
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:26,900
You're not a man,
you stinking drunk.

1212
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:29,900
What? Me, drunk?
Fuck you! Fascist!

1213
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:32,500
Fascist! He's a Nazi!

1214
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:33,900
He's a Nazi!

1215
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:38,500
Listen, offcer.
We're from Court 42, I'll handle it.

1216
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:40,100
- Come with me.
- Arrest them!

1217
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:44,400
Arrest the motherfuckers!
Show them some fucking justice!

1218
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:46,200
- Fuck you!
- My jacket! My jacket!

1219
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:47,700
You're wearing it.

1220
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:03,000
What time does your wife get home?

1221
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:05,200
At eight.

1222
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,500
How odd. There's no answer.

1223
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:09,800
My mouth is dry.

1224
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,600
Have you got any?

1225
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:14,900
There's no answer.

1226
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:16,500
Leave that alone.

1227
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:18,800
She's never going to answer.

1228
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:20,300
Why?

1229
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:21,900
Because the phone doesn't work.

1230
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,700
What do you mean?
Put that down.

1231
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:26,300
I told you a thousand times,
Benjamin.

1232
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:28,800
I wanted to sue their asses.

1233
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:31,100
And you didn't help me.

1234
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:33,200
That was 6 months ago.

1235
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:37,400
The phone hasn't worked for a year.
They never fixed it.

1236
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,800
You can't spend the night here.

1237
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:42,000
Put that down.
Stop touching stuff.

1238
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:47,100
If you ever called me,
you'd know it doesn't work.

1239
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:49,600
Leave that.
What are you looking for?

1240
01:25:49,700 --> 01:25:51,300
I wanted to sue them.

1241
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:54,400
Look at me.

1242
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,200
- You have a date?
- No, no.

1243
01:25:57,700 --> 01:25:59,800
You have a date.
And I'm leaving.

1244
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:03,000
The last thing I need
is you calling me a party pooper.

1245
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:06,300
Too much furniture in here.

1246
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:09,200
- Sit here.
- I always run into shit.

1247
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:11,900
Have a seat until you feel better.

1248
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:13,700
Have a seat.

1249
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:15,200
What time is it?

1250
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:19,200
- I have a watch in the bedroom.
- What bedroom? This is my house.

1251
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:21,900
We're doing great. Just great.

1252
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:24,400
- Take it easy.
- We're doing great.

1253
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:27,900
I'll try to convince your wife
not to kill you.

1254
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:29,900
Call her on the phone.

1255
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,400
You said it didn't work.

1256
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:38,200
Mine doesn't work, Benjamin.

1257
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:39,700
Use yours.

1258
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:47,700
Just stay here. Don't touch
anything, don't do anything.

1259
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:49,700
I'll be right back.

1260
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:53,000
- Turn off the light.
- Yes.

1261
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:57,500
We'll catch that son of a bitch.

1262
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,600
We'll catch him.

1263
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:07,200
- We were working all day.
- Save it, some othertime.

1264
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:08,400
Let me explain.

1265
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:11,000
- It's the last time.
- Okay, okay.

1266
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:14,600
You could have remembered as well.

1267
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:16,900
Be patient with him, he needs help.

1268
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:19,000
He needs help?

1269
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:22,000
What I mean is if we help him,
it's easier for everyone.

1270
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:24,000
You want to get rid of him.

1271
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:25,300
Don't say that.

1272
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:29,500
What's this?

1273
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:32,100
- What happened?
- Hold on a second.

1274
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:39,400
Pablo?

1275
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:41,900
- What is it?
- I don't know. Pablo?

1276
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:44,000
- Don't scare me.
- Wait there.

1277
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:46,700
Pablo...

1278
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:52,400
- No!
- What is it? What happened?

1279
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:57,200
What happened?

1280
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:19,600
This is madness.

1281
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:21,900
It will be if that bastard
finds you.

1282
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,700
- He's gonna go after you.
- No, my father knows who to talk to.

1283
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:29,200
He works for Romano, Romano
won't mess with me. I'll be fne.

1284
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:31,300
But Jujuy?
For God's sake, Irene.

1285
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:34,500
My cousins are like feudal
lords there. Nobody will touch you.

1286
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:37,000
What will I do in Jujuy?

1287
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:40,300
Same as here. Sign and stamp.
They have your desk ready.

1288
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:44,800
I can't. I have my life here,
I have my old man here,

1289
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:45,900
I have...

1290
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:52,600
I have everything here.

1291
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:56,600
What can we do...

1292
01:28:57,100 --> 01:28:58,000
here?

1293
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:00,300
Us.

1294
01:29:01,700 --> 01:29:02,700
I mean,

1295
01:29:03,700 --> 01:29:04,800
you and me.

1296
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:16,400
There's nothing we can do.

1297
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:50,200
Ciao.

1298
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:32,200
It's a rough draft.

1299
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:36,500
I'll make more.

1300
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:43,100
Your house is exactly
as I imagined it.

1301
01:31:43,300 --> 01:31:45,300
How did you imagine it?

1302
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,800
Exactly like this.
Exactly like I imagined it.

1303
01:31:49,100 --> 01:31:53,100
Sure, I imagined your house
would be totally different.

1304
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:55,100
You've seen my house?

1305
01:31:55,300 --> 01:31:57,100
No, I mean unlike this.

1306
01:31:57,500 --> 01:31:58,800
Totally different.

1307
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:03,600
What does this mean?

1308
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:07,700
This piece of paper says
"I FEAR."

1309
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:11,700
No, it'sjust something I did...

1310
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:15,400
a writing exercise...
half asleep...

1311
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:18,000
to inspire the imagination...
Never mind.

1312
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:20,200
Okay, shoot.

1313
01:32:23,300 --> 01:32:24,700
It's a novel.

1314
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,300
It doesn't have to be true,

1315
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:30,900
or even believable.

1316
01:32:31,100 --> 01:32:33,300
Yes. No. What?
It isn't believable?

1317
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:37,500
No, Benjamin.
That part when...

1318
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:39,800
when the guy leaves for Jujuy...

1319
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:43,200
- What's the problem?
- Crying like he's all broken up...

1320
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:47,800
Her running on the platform
after the man of her dreams...

1321
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:51,000
Touching hands through the glass
like they're one.

1322
01:32:51,100 --> 01:32:52,600
- That's what happened.
- And her crying,

1323
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,500
like she knew her fate
was mediocrity

1324
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:56,700
and never loving anyone,

1325
01:32:56,900 --> 01:32:59,000
practically falling on the tracks,

1326
01:32:59,100 --> 01:33:02,200
proclaiming love she'd never had
the courage to confess...

1327
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:04,100
That's what happened.
Isn't it?

1328
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:09,500
If that's what happened,

1329
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:14,600
why didn't you take me with you?

1330
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:29,000
Dimwit.

1331
01:33:46,700 --> 01:33:49,000
How does the case proceed?

1332
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:53,000
I don't know. I can say

1333
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:56,500
he spent 10 years
counting llamas in the Andes.

1334
01:33:57,900 --> 01:33:59,800
And when I came back
you were D.A.,

1335
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:02,800
married and with two kids.
Should I put that?

1336
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:08,700
Orthat he came back married
to a rich little Jujuyan princess.

1337
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,200
She was wonderful.

1338
01:34:11,100 --> 01:34:13,700
It wasn't her fault
I could never love her.

1339
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:19,800
It's a lousy ending.

1340
01:34:19,900 --> 01:34:21,000
It's crap.

1341
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:23,900
You see?

1342
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:27,800
I don't want to miss another chance.
How is it possible?

1343
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:30,000
How can I do nothing about it?

1344
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:31,200
I've been asking myself

1345
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:34,900
for 25 years and I've only been able
to come up with one answer.

1346
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,300
"Forget it, it was another lifetime.
It's over, don't ask."

1347
01:34:38,700 --> 01:34:41,300
It wasn't another lifetime.
It was this one.

1348
01:34:42,700 --> 01:34:44,300
It is this one.

1349
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:46,200
Now I want to understand.

1350
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:48,400
How can someone live an empty life?

1351
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:51,500
How do you live a life
full of nothing?

1352
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:53,700
How do you do it?

1353
01:34:57,900 --> 01:35:00,800
This is a waste of time.
We'll never find him.

1354
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,200
Trust me,
remember how formal he was?

1355
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:06,100
Nobody notifies a change of address.
Mine's from when I danced the pata-pata.

1356
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:07,900
Excuse me.

1357
01:35:08,300 --> 01:35:10,000
Gomez, Isidoro. Espora 691,

1358
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:13,300
- province of Chivilcoy.
- You see? That's his mother.

1359
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:18,900
Sir, we are required by law
to notify a change of address.

1360
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:21,900
It's not something we do because
we feel like it. Understand?

1361
01:35:22,100 --> 01:35:24,000
- I do now.
- Morales, Ricardo.

1362
01:35:24,100 --> 01:35:26,500
There's one, two...
Four, ma'am.

1363
01:35:26,700 --> 01:35:28,400
Let's search by I.D. Number.

1364
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:31,000
- What's your frst number?
- Three, what's yours?

1365
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,400
- What do you care?
- What? Can't I?

1366
01:35:34,900 --> 01:35:39,000
Here's a 5 and a 6.
Morales, Ricardo Augustin.

1367
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:42,500
He changed addresses in 1975.

1368
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,900
Write this down, pata-pata.

1369
01:37:00,900 --> 01:37:02,300
Who are you looking for?

1370
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,100
Morales.

1371
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:09,200
How are you? Remember me?

1372
01:37:09,900 --> 01:37:11,100
Esposito.

1373
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:14,000
From the courts... 25 years ago.

1374
01:37:19,100 --> 01:37:21,900
- Quite a surprise.
- I know, sorry.

1375
01:37:31,900 --> 01:37:33,700
- How are you?
- Hello.

1376
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:37,800
Long time.

1377
01:37:40,700 --> 01:37:42,000
What a surprise.

1378
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:43,200
Yeah.

1379
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:50,300
Come in.

1380
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:52,700
Shall I make coffee?

1381
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:54,400
Coffee?

1382
01:37:54,900 --> 01:37:57,000
You're not drinking mat out here?

1383
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:59,100
Out here?

1384
01:37:59,300 --> 01:38:01,700
I'm at the bank all day long.

1385
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:03,500
You're still at the bank?

1386
01:38:04,100 --> 01:38:05,500
I'll take that coffee.

1387
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:12,300
You moved out here right after.

1388
01:38:12,700 --> 01:38:16,000
Yes. I wanted to start over,
from scratch.

1389
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:20,600
That's the good thing
about the bank.

1390
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,100
They have branches everywhere.

1391
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,900
There's always a branch nobody
wants, so here I am,

1392
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:28,000
with a promotion and everything.

1393
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:29,700
How about that.

1394
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:38,700
Remember Liliana?

1395
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:42,300
Yes, of course.

1396
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,400
How are you doing?

1397
01:38:52,300 --> 01:38:53,500
Still here.

1398
01:38:54,900 --> 01:38:56,500
No, I mean single,

1399
01:38:56,600 --> 01:38:58,700
- married...
- No.

1400
01:38:58,900 --> 01:39:00,100
No, really.

1401
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:03,300
I think I just... at that point...

1402
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:06,000
just closed shop.

1403
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:09,000
I tried, but you know what?

1404
01:39:10,700 --> 01:39:12,000
It's complicated.

1405
01:39:13,300 --> 01:39:15,300
- I got married.
- You don't say.

1406
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:17,000
Yeah, for a while.

1407
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:19,700
But it didn't work.

1408
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:22,700
I don't know ifit was me...

1409
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,100
It's complicated.

1410
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:26,500
It's complicated.

1411
01:39:34,700 --> 01:39:36,500
Quite a story.

1412
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:38,700
I can't believe it.

1413
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:40,900
Neverthought I had a novel in me.

1414
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:44,700
You should flesh it out.
It's like a long memo.

1415
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:46,400
Crazy.

1416
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:48,400
I could never forget it.

1417
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:51,600
A mistake.
You should put it behind you.

1418
01:39:52,300 --> 01:39:53,500
Trust me.

1419
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:58,300
You came here because of Gomez,
right?

1420
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:01,000
What do you mean?

1421
01:40:01,300 --> 01:40:04,000
He was on the loose,
he might come looking for you.

1422
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,100
No, no.

1423
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:10,300
I'm not scared of Gomez.

1424
01:40:10,900 --> 01:40:13,000
Maybe he's dead.

1425
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:14,600
Maybe.

1426
01:40:22,300 --> 01:40:24,100
They came looking for me.

1427
01:40:24,500 --> 01:40:25,800
Yes, I know.

1428
01:40:27,700 --> 01:40:29,700
- How do you know?
- I just read it.

1429
01:40:29,900 --> 01:40:32,500
- They found your friend.
- Oh, right.

1430
01:40:33,700 --> 01:40:35,100
Poor Sandoval.

1431
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:36,700
Do you remember Sandoval?

1432
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:37,900
No.

1433
01:40:38,300 --> 01:40:39,900
My coworker at the courts.

1434
01:40:41,900 --> 01:40:44,200
They came looking for me,
didn't fnd me

1435
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:46,000
and let him have it.

1436
01:40:46,300 --> 01:40:47,700
Bastards.

1437
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:52,300
Gomez was never found, right?

1438
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:53,600
Guess.

1439
01:40:57,500 --> 01:40:59,700
Those guys always get away with it.

1440
01:41:04,300 --> 01:41:07,600
You know, there's something
I need to ask you.

1441
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:12,100
How did you learn to live
without Liliana?

1442
01:41:14,300 --> 01:41:16,100
It was 25 years ago, Esposito.

1443
01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:17,700
I was sure you wouldn't be able to.

1444
01:41:17,900 --> 01:41:20,300
- It was 25 years ago, Esposito.
- Especially with him on the loose.

1445
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:22,000
How did you start over?

1446
01:41:22,100 --> 01:41:24,100
It was 25 years ago!

1447
01:41:25,200 --> 01:41:26,300
Forget it.

1448
01:41:38,900 --> 01:41:41,600
If it weren't for me,
you wouldn't have made it this far.

1449
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:44,400
Rememberthat?

1450
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:45,900
You owe me one.

1451
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:49,300
I don't know what you want me
to say.

1452
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:51,900
You didn't care
the guy got a free ride.

1453
01:41:52,100 --> 01:41:53,300
There was nothing I could do.

1454
01:41:55,100 --> 01:41:59,100
You spent a year looking forthe guy,
they let him go and you do nothing?

1455
01:41:59,300 --> 01:42:01,800
I wasted a year looking for him
and they let him go!

1456
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,500
- What can I do?
- That's it?

1457
01:42:03,700 --> 01:42:05,400
- Yes!
- The rest of your life behind a desk?

1458
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:07,300
- Look who's talking.
- You're better than I am.

1459
01:42:08,300 --> 01:42:09,900
What do you care?

1460
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:13,600
- It's my life, not yours.
- No, Morales.

1461
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:15,300
It's my life too.

1462
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:19,100
Your love forthat woman...
I never saw it again.

1463
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:20,300
In anybody.

1464
01:42:21,900 --> 01:42:23,100
Nobody.

1465
01:42:23,900 --> 01:42:25,000
Ever.

1466
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:30,500
Get out of my house.

1467
01:42:34,300 --> 01:42:35,600
Right now, please.

1468
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:39,100
It's my life, not yours.

1469
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:47,100
I'm sorry.

1470
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:48,300
I'm...

1471
01:42:51,900 --> 01:42:53,700
getting old, that's it.

1472
01:42:56,600 --> 01:42:57,900
That might be it.

1473
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:05,300
I couldn't stop thinking about it.

1474
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:07,300
Go dwell on it at home.

1475
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:26,100
Gomez didn't kill Sandoval.

1476
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:28,700
So?

1477
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:31,400
He knew us both.

1478
01:43:31,700 --> 01:43:34,300
If he'd been there,
he'd have waited for me.

1479
01:43:38,700 --> 01:43:39,900
There's something...

1480
01:43:40,900 --> 01:43:43,100
I had a couple of photos at home,
of myself.

1481
01:43:43,900 --> 01:43:46,300
When Sandoval got killed,

1482
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:49,300
the photos had been turned over.

1483
01:43:50,300 --> 01:43:52,600
Nothing else had been touched.

1484
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:54,700
I thought...

1485
01:43:56,600 --> 01:43:57,800
I think...

1486
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:16,900
Are you Esposito?

1487
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:24,600
Did you hear what I said, asshole?
Are you Esposito?

1488
01:44:29,400 --> 01:44:31,600
- What's going on?
- What are you doing?

1489
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:34,600
Answer me.

1490
01:44:37,300 --> 01:44:39,100
Where are you going?

1491
01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:40,900
Where are you going?

1492
01:44:41,100 --> 01:44:43,700
- Here.
- What are you going to do?

1493
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:48,000
I'm going to put on a record.
It's okay.

1494
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:50,700
A record?

1495
01:44:51,300 --> 01:44:52,500
Listen to me.

1496
01:44:53,700 --> 01:44:55,700
Are you Esposito or not?

1497
01:45:03,100 --> 01:45:04,200
Yes, I am.

1498
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:44,700
I'm so ashamed I can't even bring
myself to put flowers on his grave.

1499
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,900
Maybe that's not what happened.

1500
01:45:54,300 --> 01:45:58,100
Maybe he fell asleep and they
killed him without him even realizing,

1501
01:45:59,500 --> 01:46:01,300
somebody knocked over the photos

1502
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:03,900
by accident, bumped into them...

1503
01:46:05,300 --> 01:46:06,300
I don't know.

1504
01:46:07,300 --> 01:46:09,500
I don't know what to think anymore.

1505
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:11,900
Choose carefully.

1506
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:15,300
Memories are all we end up with.

1507
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:17,900
At least pick the nice ones.

1508
01:46:20,900 --> 01:46:22,300
But there's one thing

1509
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:24,500
I know I'll never forget.

1510
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:28,500
The last thing Pablo said to me
the night they killed him.

1511
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:30,900
"Don't worry, Benjamin.

1512
01:46:31,100 --> 01:46:33,200
We'll catch that son of a bitch."

1513
01:46:34,900 --> 01:46:36,500
And I will.

1514
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:40,300
Lfhe's alive, I will.

1515
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:48,900
Wait.

1516
01:46:52,100 --> 01:46:53,900
Come in, sit down.

1517
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:07,100
You can stop looking.

1518
01:47:09,100 --> 01:47:10,800
I couldn't go to the authorities.

1519
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:13,000
I knew the guy was untouchable.

1520
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:17,600
But I also knew sooner or later
he'd come looking...

1521
01:47:19,100 --> 01:47:20,400
for you.

1522
01:47:57,400 --> 01:47:58,900
Hey, Gomez!

1523
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:46,500
I got rid of the body
and obviously he wasn't missed.

1524
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:01,500
Was it worth it?

1525
01:49:03,400 --> 01:49:04,800
Forget about it.

1526
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:06,600
Forget it.

1527
01:49:07,700 --> 01:49:09,000
Who cares?

1528
01:49:09,900 --> 01:49:11,300
My wife is dead.

1529
01:49:11,500 --> 01:49:12,900
Your friend is dead.

1530
01:49:13,100 --> 01:49:14,900
Gomez is dead too.
They're all dead.

1531
01:49:15,100 --> 01:49:16,900
Stop dwelling on it.

1532
01:49:17,100 --> 01:49:20,000
You'll start wondering
if you could have stopped it...

1533
01:49:20,200 --> 01:49:22,800
You'll have a thousand pasts
and no future.

1534
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:26,500
Forget about it, trust me.

1535
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:30,500
You'll end up with only memories.

1536
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:36,500
I owed you one, right?

1537
01:49:38,900 --> 01:49:40,300
Now we're even.

1538
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,500
Forget about it.

1539
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:07,500
Forget it.

1540
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:10,300
I couldn't stop thinking about it.

1541
01:50:10,700 --> 01:50:12,300
What would four bu/lets getme?

1542
01:50:18,100 --> 01:50:19,600
It's my life,

1543
01:50:20,500 --> 01:50:21,600
not yours.

1544
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:23,100
Go dwell on it at home.

1545
01:50:24,300 --> 01:50:25,800
We'll catch him.

1546
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:29,900
I've been wondering for 25 years.

1547
01:50:31,200 --> 01:50:32,200
Ciao.

1548
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,300
It wasn't another lfetime.
It was this one.

1549
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:40,100
A guy can do anything
to be different.

1550
01:50:40,900 --> 01:50:42,600
What would four bullets get me?

1551
01:50:42,700 --> 01:50:46,700
But there's one thing he can't change.
Not him, not you, not anybody.

1552
01:51:31,500 --> 01:51:33,000
How can someone live
an empty life?

1553
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:42,400
How do you live a life
full of nothing?

1554
01:51:50,100 --> 01:51:51,300
How do you do it?

1555
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:48,500
I fucked the shit out of her!

1556
01:52:48,700 --> 01:52:49,900
What retribution?

1557
01:52:51,100 --> 01:52:54,100
Please...

1558
01:52:54,500 --> 01:52:56,100
It's as if his wife's death

1559
01:52:56,300 --> 01:52:58,100
just left him there,
stuck in time forever.

1560
01:53:01,200 --> 01:53:02,400
My wife is dead.

1561
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:06,600
Your friend is dead.
Gomez is dead too. They're all dead.

1562
01:53:08,700 --> 01:53:10,300
They'd give him an injection

1563
01:53:10,500 --> 01:53:11,600
and he'd take a nap.

1564
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:13,400
Nobody, Benjamin.

1565
01:53:14,500 --> 01:53:16,600
Let him grow old.

1566
01:53:16,900 --> 01:53:19,500
Live a life full of nothing.

1567
01:53:19,700 --> 01:53:21,300
How did you start over?

1568
01:53:21,500 --> 01:53:23,400
That was 25 years ago.

1569
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:27,200
25 years, Esposito.

1570
01:53:27,900 --> 01:53:29,100
Forget about it.

1571
01:55:19,100 --> 01:55:20,300
Please.

1572
01:55:23,200 --> 01:55:24,300
Tell him...

1573
01:55:24,700 --> 01:55:29,300
Tell him at least to talk to me.

1574
01:55:47,100 --> 01:55:48,300
Please.

1575
01:56:29,500 --> 01:56:31,100
You said life.

1576
01:58:00,100 --> 01:58:01,500
"I FEAR"

1577
01:58:10,900 --> 01:58:12,500
"I LOVE YOU"

1578
01:58:30,700 --> 01:58:33,200
- Is she in?
- Yeah, in her office.

1579
01:58:44,500 --> 01:58:45,700
You're alive.

1580
01:58:46,300 --> 01:58:47,300
Yeah.

1581
01:58:48,900 --> 01:58:50,400
I need to talk to you.

1582
01:58:58,500 --> 01:59:00,600
- Shall I bring coffee, ma'am?
- Go away.

1583
01:59:07,600 --> 01:59:09,100
It'll be complicated.

1584
01:59:10,700 --> 01:59:12,100
I don't care.

1585
01:59:23,100 --> 01:59:24,500
Shut the door.

1586
01:59:36,500 --> 01:59:39,900
