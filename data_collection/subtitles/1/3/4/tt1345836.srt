our jewel thief. I ran her prints.

someone else's fingerprints.

on the necklace.

- My fingerprints.

00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:28,614
It used to be funded by
the Wayne Foundation. It's an orphanage.

342
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:33,695
My mom died when I was small. It was
a car accident, I don't really remember it.

343
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:39,496
But my dad got shot a couple years later
over a gambling debt...

344
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,995
...and I remember that one just fine.

345
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,253
Not a lot of people know
what it feels like, do they?

346
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,376
To be angry...

347
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:51,970
...in your bones.

348
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,679
I mean, they understand.

349
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:58,681
Foster parents.

350
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,846
Everybody understands...

351
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:02,640
...for a while.

352
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:07,111
And then they want the angry little kid
to do something he knows he can't do.

353
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:08,778
Move on.

354
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,322
So after a while,
they stop understanding.

355
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,358
They send the angry kid to a boys' home.

356
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:17,534
I figured it out too late.
You gotta learn to hide the anger.

357
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,582
Practice smiling in a mirror.

358
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,911
It's like putting on a mask.

359
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:28,712
So you showed up this one day,
in a cool car.

360
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,717
Pretty girl on your arm.

361
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,591
We were so excited.

362
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:36,473
Bruce Wayne, billionaire orphan.

363
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:40,679
I mean, we used to make up stories
about you, man. Legends.

364
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:44,644
And, you know, with the other kids,
that's all it was, just stories, but...

365
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,519
Right when I saw you,
I knew who you really were.

366
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,777
I'd seen that look on your face before.

367
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,943
It's the same one I taught myself.

368
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:00,782
I don't know why you took the fall
for Dent's murder...

369
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:03,705
...but I'm still a
believer in the Batman...

370
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,207
...even if you're not.

371
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:13,841
Why did you say that your boys' home used
to be funded by the Wayne Foundation?

372
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,754
BLAKE:
Because the money stopped.

373
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:20,142
Might be time to get some fresh air.
Start paying attention to the details.

374
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,387
Some of those details
might need your help.

375
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,523
WAYNE:
You check that name? Bane?

376
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,356
ALFRED: He's a mercenary.
No other known names.

377
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,987
Him and his men were behind
a coup in West Africa...

378
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:36,651
...that secured mining operations
for our friend John Daggett.

379
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,158
WAYNE: Now Daggett's brought them here.
- Or so it seems.

380
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:44,367
- I'll keep digging.
- Yeah.

381
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:51,799
Alfred, why did the Wayne Foundation
stop funding boys' homes in the city?

382
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:57,054
The foundation is funded by
the profits of Wayne Enterprises.

383
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:58,926
There have to be some.

384
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:02,434
- Time to talk to Mr. Fox, I think.
- I'll get him on the phone.

385
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:06,597
No, no, no. Do we still have
any cars around the place?

386
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,640
Yes. One or two.

387
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,809
I need an appointment at the hospital
for my leg.

388
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:13,729
- Which hospital?
- Whichever one Jim Gordon's in.

389
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:20,907
DOCTOR: I have seen worse cartilage in knees.
WAYNE: That's good.

390
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,572
No. That's because there is
no cartilage in your knee.

391
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:27,084
And not much of any use
in your elbows or your shoulders.

392
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,620
Between that and the scar tissue
on your kidneys...

393
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,460
...the residual concussive damage
to your brain tissue...

394
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:35,296
...and the general scarred-over quality
of your body...

395
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:38,383
...I cannot recommend that you go heli-skiing.
- Right.

396
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,355
We were in this together...

397
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:00,029
...then you were gone.

398
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,320
WAYNE:
The Batman wasn't needed any more.

399
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:05,615
- We won.
- Based on a lie.

400
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:13,127
And now there's evil rising
from where we tried to bury it.

401
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:17,801
The Batman has to come back.

402
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,428
What if he doesn't exist any more?

403
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:24,057
He must.

You took my goddamn wallet, didn't you?

405
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:42,652
- You f... You took my wallet!
- No, I...

406
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,579
- Get out.
YUPPIE: She took my... Ah!

407
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,331
- Now.
YUPPIE: Creep!

408
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:51,414
I don't know what he's so upset about.
There's only 60 bucks in here.

Miss Tate, isn't it?

422
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:39,337
Even before you became a recluse,
you never came to these things.

423
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:43,170
The proceeds go to the big fat spread.
It's not about charity.

424

It's about feeding the ego
of whichever society hag laid this on.

Actually, this is my party, Mr. Wayne.

Oh.

427
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:57,935
And the proceeds will go where they should,
because I paid for the big fat spread myself.

428
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,728
That's very generous of you.

- I'm sorry.
- You have a practiced apathy, Mr. Wayne.

433
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:18,664
But a man who doesn't care about the world
doesn't spend half his fortune to save it.

you're a crook, not a social climber.

you're saving for retirement...

...or you're in deep with the wrong people.

You don't get to judge me because you were
born in the master bedroom of Wayne Manor.

- Actually, I was born in the Regency Room.
- I started out doing what I had to.

1525

- We have about 18 hours to do something.
- To do what?

1526
01:58:41,754 --> 01:58:45,759
GORDON: To mark the truck. Get a GPS on it so we
can start to figure out how to bring it down.

01:58:58,855 --> 01:59:02,780
- Where's Foley, damn it?
- You shouldn't be out on the streets.

- Jim, he's not here.
- You let your wife come to the door?

- When the city's under occupation?
- Wait in the kitchen, honey.

1532

What did you do,
bury your uniform in the backyard?

1533
01:59:16,581 --> 01:59:18,709
You saw what they did
to those Special Forces.

1534
01:59:18,875 --> 01:59:21,219
Have you forgotten all the years
we were out on patrol?

1535
01:59:21,377 --> 01:59:24,506
When every gangbanger wanted to plant one
as soon as our backs were turned?

1536
01:59:24,672 --> 01:59:28,802
That was different. These guys run the city.
The government's done a deal with them.

1537
01:59:28,968 --> 01:59:31,517
Bane's got their balls in a vice.
That's not a deal.

1538
01:59:31,679 --> 01:59:34,979
You move on Bane,
the triggerman is gonna hit the button.

1539
01:59:35,141 --> 01:59:39,112
You think he's given control of that bomb
to one of the people?

1540
01:59:39,270 --> 01:59:41,272
You think this is part of some revolution?

1541
01:59:41,439 --> 01:59:44,283
There's one man with his finger
on the button. That's Bane.

Look, we've all got to keep our heads
down till they can fix this.

- This only gets fixed from inside...

- Sorry, Jim. I gotta...
- Keep your head down?

What goods that gonna do
when that thing blows?

How about me instead?

Nothing! I didn't take anything!

Now, you boys know you can't come into
my neighborhood without asking politely.

You're pretty generous for a thief.

02:01:01,269 --> 02:01:04,022
- I thought they killed you.
- Not yet.

1562

- If you're expecting an apology, I...
- It wouldn't suit you.

For this. Clean slate.

1566

You'd trust me with that?

After what I did to you?

1568
02:01:18,703 --> 02:01:21,627
I'll admit, I was a little let down.

In fact, I think that for you...

- I can give you a way off...

- To save the city.

02:29:57,545 --> 02:30:00,674
Come on! There you go!
Okay, you too. Come on, Father.

1859
02:30:19,942 --> 02:30:21,819
Hey, heads down! This is it!

1860
02:30:22,153 --> 02:30:25,077
- No.
- No, that's Batman!

1861
02:31:04,904 --> 02:31:06,998
(BEEPING)

1862
02:31:13,287 --> 02:31:14,584
That's detonation!

1863
02:31:22,046 --> 02:31:23,969
It's out over the bay! Clear of the city!

1864
02:31:24,173 --> 02:31:26,596
(CHEERING)

1865
02:31:43,818 --> 02:31:46,662
GORDON:<i>
"I see a beautiful city...</i>

1866
02:31:46,821 --> 02:31:48,949
<i>...and a brilliant people...</i>

1867
02:31:49,198 --> 02:31:51,200
<i>...rising from this abyss.</i>

1868
02:31:52,410 --> 02:31:56,415
<i>I see the lives for which
I lay down my life...</i>

1869
02:31:56,831 --> 02:31:58,048
<i>...peaceful...</i>

1870
02:31:58,791 --> 02:32:02,045
<i>...useful, prosperous and happy.</i>

1871
02:32:04,505 --> 02:32:08,135
<i>I see that I hold a sanctuary
in their hearts...</i>

1872
02:32:09,969 --> 02:32:13,143
<i>...and in the hearts
of their descendants...</i>

1873
02:32:13,973 --> 02:32:15,691
<i>...generations hence.</i>

1874
02:32:18,394 --> 02:32:22,615
It is a far, far better thing that I do...

1875
02:32:23,482 --> 02:32:25,450
...than I have ever done.

1876
02:32:26,485 --> 02:32:30,991
It is a far, far better
rest that I go to...

1877
02:32:33,910 --> 02:32:35,628
...than I have ever known."

1878
02:32:51,010 --> 02:32:53,183
(ALFRED SOBBING)

1879
02:32:53,971 --> 02:32:55,393
ALFRED:
I'm so sorry.

1880
02:32:55,765 --> 02:32:57,483
I failed you.

1881
02:32:59,518 --> 02:33:01,145
You trusted me...

1882
02:33:02,730 --> 02:33:03,856
...and I failed you.

1883
02:33:07,985 --> 02:33:09,783
Can I change your mind...

1884
02:33:12,114 --> 02:33:14,037
...about quitting the force?

1885
02:33:14,951 --> 02:33:18,797
You know what you said about
structures becoming shackles?

1886
02:33:19,163 --> 02:33:22,713
You were right, and I can't take it.
The injustice.

1887
02:33:22,917 --> 02:33:27,218
I mean, no one's ever gonna know
who saved an entire city.

1888
02:33:27,421 --> 02:33:28,513
They know.

1889
02:33:30,424 --> 02:33:32,142
It was the Batman.

1890
02:33:50,194 --> 02:33:53,789
LAWYER:<i> Mr. Wayne's will was not amended
to reflect his more modest estate.</i>

1891
02:33:53,948 --> 02:33:57,794
Nonetheless, there are considerable
assets to dispose of.

1892
02:33:57,952 --> 02:34:01,422
The contents of the house are to be sold
to settle the estate's accounts...

1893
02:34:01,580 --> 02:34:05,926
<i>...and the remainder is left in its
entirety to Alfred J. Pennyworth.</i>

1894
02:34:07,378 --> 02:34:12,259
The house and grounds are left to
the city of Gotham on condition that...

1895
02:34:12,425 --> 02:34:16,146
...they never be demolished,
altered or otherwise interfered with...

1896
02:34:16,303 --> 02:34:20,103
...and that they shall be used for
one purpose, and one purpose only:

1897
02:34:21,767 --> 02:34:26,022
The housing and care of the city's
at-risk and orphaned children.

1898
02:34:26,605 --> 02:34:31,076
<i>My clerk can help with the smaller
correspondences and instructions.</i>

1899
02:34:31,235 --> 02:34:32,657
BLAKE:<i>
Blake, John.</i>

1900
02:34:32,945 --> 02:34:36,199
- Nothing here.
- Uh, try my legal name.

1901
02:34:39,618 --> 02:34:42,417
You should use your full name.
I like that name.

1902
02:34:42,580 --> 02:34:44,457
- Robin.
- Thanks.

1903
02:34:44,623 --> 02:34:46,796
SCIENTIST 1: <i>Why worry about
the stabilization software?</i>

1904
02:34:46,959 --> 02:34:48,961
This entire autopilot system's
completely obsolete.

1905
02:34:49,128 --> 02:34:52,928
Please, I just need to know
what I could've done to fix it.

1906
02:34:53,090 --> 02:34:57,220
But, Mr. Fox, it's already been fixed.
Software patch. Six months ago.

1907
02:34:57,386 --> 02:34:58,979
Check the ID on the patch.

1908
02:35:02,058 --> 02:35:03,651
SCIENTIST 2:
Bruce Wayne.

1909
02:35:04,518 --> 02:35:06,816
- Any news on the missing item?
- Not yet.

1910
02:35:06,979 --> 02:35:08,401
They better leave no stone unturned.

1911
02:35:08,564 --> 02:35:11,989
We can't leave a string of pearls
on the manifest as lost.
