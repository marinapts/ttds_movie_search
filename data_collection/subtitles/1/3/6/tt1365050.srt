2
00:01:14,738 --> 00:01:16,949
It is starting like this.

3
00:01:23,664 --> 00:01:25,291
Let's keep looking.

4
00:01:25,374 --> 00:01:27,335
They aren't good enough.

5
00:01:28,544 --> 00:01:29,795
Let's take that girl.

6
00:01:29,878 --> 00:01:31,004
Which one?

7
00:01:31,089 --> 00:01:32,631
That girl. Zoey. Let's take her.

8
00:01:32,715 --> 00:01:34,007
Ah...no.

9
00:01:35,176 --> 00:01:36,594
What about that one?

10
00:01:36,677 --> 00:01:37,678
Him?

11
00:01:37,761 --> 00:01:38,762
Yes.

12
00:01:38,846 --> 00:01:40,973
Our country is at war

13
00:01:41,056 --> 00:01:43,309
and we are having no more school.

14
00:01:43,392 --> 00:01:46,645
So we are having to be finding ways
to be keeping busy.

15
00:01:58,991 --> 00:02:00,409
And what am I gonna do with this, Agu?

16
00:02:00,493 --> 00:02:01,910
It's a TV. I'm selling it.

17
00:02:01,994 --> 00:02:03,954
This dirty thing with no screen?

18
00:02:04,037 --> 00:02:05,038
Let's go!

19
00:02:05,123 --> 00:02:06,665
Soap opera.

20
00:02:06,749 --> 00:02:07,916
Be quick!

21
00:02:09,418 --> 00:02:10,836
Please, I love you.

22
00:02:10,836 --> 00:02:11,670
- Please, I love you.
- I don't love you.

23
00:02:11,754 --> 00:02:12,588
But why?

24
00:02:12,588 --> 00:02:14,006
- But why?
- Because you're not handsome. Go!

25
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:14,923
Oh, please, I beg.

26
00:02:14,923 --> 00:02:16,134
- Oh, please, I beg.
- Don't follow me. Go!

27
00:02:16,217 --> 00:02:17,718
I am having the ideas.

28
00:02:17,801 --> 00:02:20,804
- Go!
- And Dike is having the talent.

29
00:02:23,224 --> 00:02:24,308
Dance! Dance! Dance!

30
00:02:34,568 --> 00:02:35,528
Kung fu! Kung fu!

31
00:02:35,528 --> 00:02:36,987
Kung fu! Kung fu!

32
00:02:39,407 --> 00:02:41,825
Yeah!

33
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:43,035
Yes!

34
00:02:44,537 --> 00:02:46,580
It's garbage. All of you go away!

35
00:02:46,664 --> 00:02:49,292
It's an imagination TV! How
can you say it's garbage?

36
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,459
It's garbage, Agu.

37
00:02:52,044 --> 00:02:54,380
Don't worry, let's go.

38
00:02:56,715 --> 00:02:59,177
We are living in a buffer zone.

39
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,596
My father is saying, <i>Outside,
people are suffering,</i>

40
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,432
<i>but here we are safe.</i>

41
00:03:04,515 --> 00:03:08,644
That is why so many refugees
are coming here small-small.

42
00:03:18,946 --> 00:03:21,199
Master, master, please,
will you buy this TV?

43
00:03:21,282 --> 00:03:22,783
How am I supposed to watch this?

44
00:03:22,866 --> 00:03:24,785
This is imagination TV.

45
00:03:24,868 --> 00:03:27,455
The Nigerians are keeping the peace.

46
00:03:27,538 --> 00:03:29,707
It is imagination TV.

47
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,711
They are always buying things, so
they are easy to be selling to.

48
00:03:34,753 --> 00:03:36,297
3D!

49
00:03:41,385 --> 00:03:44,263
Okay. How much for this treasure?

50
00:03:44,347 --> 00:03:45,556
Three thousand.

51
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:47,808
Huh? Three thousand. Too much!
Thousand five.

52
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:49,268
Thousand five no good.

53
00:03:49,352 --> 00:03:50,519
Two thousand. Two thousand.

54
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:51,479
- Two thousand. Two thousand.
- Two thou.

55
00:03:51,562 --> 00:03:53,356
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Thousand five.

56
00:03:54,315 --> 00:03:55,148
Some food, some food.

57
00:03:55,148 --> 00:03:57,109
- Some food, some food.
- Bring out some of your food and take it.

58
00:03:58,402 --> 00:04:01,113
Uche, bring the foods and come.

59
00:04:07,828 --> 00:04:09,705
Here, take. Go!

60
00:04:30,226 --> 00:04:33,729
I am a good boy from a good family.

61
00:04:33,812 --> 00:04:36,023
My mother is always working hard for us.

62
00:04:36,106 --> 00:04:37,566
Taste this.

63
00:04:40,027 --> 00:04:41,153
Thank you.

64
00:04:41,987 --> 00:04:43,196
It's good.

65
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,660
<i>B is for butterfly.</i>

66
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,745
<i>Sara, small...</i>

67
00:04:49,828 --> 00:04:51,038
<i>Soaring.</i>

68
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:52,748
<i>- Soaring.
- Soaring overhead.</i>

69
00:04:54,417 --> 00:04:56,084
Nice idea.

70
00:04:57,002 --> 00:04:58,462
My father was a teacher.

71
00:04:58,546 --> 00:04:59,547
Clap for him!

72
00:05:00,798 --> 00:05:02,925
That's good. And another one!

73
00:05:04,927 --> 00:05:06,178
That's good.

74
00:05:06,262 --> 00:05:07,263
Agu!

75
00:05:07,346 --> 00:05:08,889
Where do lions live?

76
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:10,891
In the zoo.

77
00:05:10,974 --> 00:05:12,310
Shame him.

78
00:05:12,393 --> 00:05:13,936
Shame!

79
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:15,771
Who can tell me where lions live?

80
00:05:15,854 --> 00:05:19,775
I like my father more now
that he's not my teacher.

81
00:05:19,858 --> 00:05:23,028
Since the war, he is a busy man.

82
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:25,406
He is using some of our land

83
00:05:25,489 --> 00:05:28,784
so that the refugees can
be making a new village.

84
00:05:29,785 --> 00:05:32,955
What we need now is medicine.

85
00:05:33,956 --> 00:05:35,165
Big brother.

86
00:05:35,248 --> 00:05:38,419
He is more concerned with
his muscles and his hair.

87
00:05:38,502 --> 00:05:42,214
Sometimes I am adding to his soaps.

88
00:05:44,717 --> 00:05:45,718
Stop that!

89
00:05:46,969 --> 00:05:48,471
When I get a hold of you...

90
00:05:48,971 --> 00:05:49,972
Leave me alone!

91
00:05:50,055 --> 00:05:51,056
You have no respect!

92
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:54,142
I was trying to make it warmer for you!

93
00:05:54,226 --> 00:05:55,227
Leave me alone!

94
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,605
You're lucky I don't shit on you.

95
00:05:57,688 --> 00:05:59,440
I'm gonna fart on your face.

96
00:05:59,523 --> 00:06:03,611
Big brother is also concerned
with sleeping.

97
00:06:03,694 --> 00:06:08,449
I want to sleep with this girl
before the war gets here.

98
00:06:13,412 --> 00:06:15,748
I am not liking his music.

99
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:18,709
Let me go! I didn't do anything
to deserve this!

100
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:21,462
I am not liking his dancing.

101
00:06:21,545 --> 00:06:24,548
And how can that girl be sleeping
if he is making so much noise?

102
00:06:24,632 --> 00:06:27,926
Let me go! I don't like this!

103
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,889
Treat your neighbor as your brother.

104
00:06:31,972 --> 00:06:35,643
And treat the market vendor...

105
00:06:35,726 --> 00:06:38,020
as your mother or older sister.

106
00:06:38,103 --> 00:06:40,188
My mother is always saying,

107
00:06:40,272 --> 00:06:42,608
<i>If you do not know what to be doing,</i>

108
00:06:42,691 --> 00:06:45,944
<i>you can always be asking God
for the answer.</i>

109
00:06:46,028 --> 00:06:47,154
Say Amen!

110
00:06:47,237 --> 00:06:48,238
Amen!

111
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:49,407
Say it louder!

112
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,784
Amen!

113
00:06:53,452 --> 00:06:57,540
Choir, give us a song and
then we'll continue.

114
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:08,216
God is liking music more
than just talking.

115
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:13,305
So if you are singing and dancing, then
he will be listening to us well-well.

116
00:07:26,652 --> 00:07:28,404
Cut that branch.

117
00:07:28,487 --> 00:07:29,572
I'll fall.

118
00:07:29,655 --> 00:07:30,781
Just hold on tight and cut it.

119
00:07:30,864 --> 00:07:31,865
No way.

120
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:33,116
Then cut that one instead.

121
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,078
Have your lazy friend do it.

122
00:07:36,161 --> 00:07:37,245
He's the driver. Cut that one.

123
00:07:37,329 --> 00:07:39,582
You're too small, you'll fall!

124
00:07:39,665 --> 00:07:41,584
- Shut up!
- You shut up!

125
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:43,001
- Go home!
- You go home!

126
00:07:43,085 --> 00:07:44,086
Midget.

127
00:07:45,087 --> 00:07:46,379
Cut it.

128
00:07:47,047 --> 00:07:48,507
He wants me to fall.

129
00:07:48,591 --> 00:07:50,801
If I was a taxi driver,
I'd drive around it.

130
00:07:57,433 --> 00:07:59,226
Get ready!

131
00:08:03,564 --> 00:08:04,565
What is this?

132
00:08:04,648 --> 00:08:07,067
We've been working all day. Give us
some money for our work.

133
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,360
Why did you block the road?

134
00:08:08,444 --> 00:08:10,738
We are trying to fix it.

135
00:08:10,821 --> 00:08:12,656
Get out of here!

136
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,782
But we need to eat!

137
00:08:13,866 --> 00:08:15,242
Take this.

138
00:08:15,325 --> 00:08:16,702
I don't want your chicken.

139
00:08:24,668 --> 00:08:26,754
Why are children so disrespectful?

140
00:08:27,337 --> 00:08:28,380
Huh?

141
00:08:28,464 --> 00:08:29,632
You!

142
00:08:29,715 --> 00:08:30,841
Curse be upon you.

143
00:08:30,924 --> 00:08:33,135
Curse yourself, standing
in the middle of the road.

144
00:08:33,218 --> 00:08:34,637
I know you very well!

145
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,221
I know your whole family!

146
00:08:36,764 --> 00:08:38,348
You're thieves!

147
00:08:38,431 --> 00:08:40,267
You stole my land!
Me, an old woman!

148
00:08:40,893 --> 00:08:42,060
Do you want this chicken?

149
00:08:42,728 --> 00:08:46,314
The devil will bless you one by one!

150
00:09:03,248 --> 00:09:04,500
Grandfather.

151
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:08,211
The lights are on, but nobody is home.

152
00:09:10,297 --> 00:09:12,633
We saw that witch woman today.

153
00:09:12,716 --> 00:09:15,218
She said we were thieves.

154
00:09:15,302 --> 00:09:17,220
Why would she say that?

155
00:09:17,304 --> 00:09:19,515
That woman...

156
00:09:19,598 --> 00:09:21,474
she's confused.

157
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:23,644
God has taken her mind.

158
00:09:23,727 --> 00:09:25,729
Slow down.

159
00:09:26,689 --> 00:09:28,899
The land we gave to the refugees...

160
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:31,401
has been in our family since
before your grandfather.

161
00:09:31,484 --> 00:09:33,654
I gave her a place, but she refused.

162
00:09:33,737 --> 00:09:34,863
So she's crazy?

163
00:09:43,496 --> 00:09:45,082
Ugh!

164
00:09:59,805 --> 00:10:00,848
What is this?

165
00:10:04,476 --> 00:10:06,103
Who did this to my TV?

166
00:10:09,648 --> 00:10:10,691
What is this?

167
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:15,028
Agu! Agu!

168
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,145
If I acted like you when I was your age,

169
00:10:48,228 --> 00:10:50,480
Dad would've beaten me.

170
00:10:50,563 --> 00:10:53,651
You're lucky there's a war.

171
00:10:53,734 --> 00:10:55,861
It's not luck, everybody loves me.

172
00:10:56,612 --> 00:10:57,905
Like who?

173
00:11:00,573 --> 00:11:02,284
There she is.

174
00:11:04,161 --> 00:11:05,412
She's looking at you!

175
00:11:05,495 --> 00:11:06,747
Really?

176
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:07,831
Still?

177
00:11:07,915 --> 00:11:09,374
She looked away.

178
00:11:16,214 --> 00:11:17,716
Do you think she likes me?

179
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,176
My eyes are not good.

180
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:20,678
So you couldn't tell?

181
00:11:22,054 --> 00:11:23,471
You don't know what's up.

182
00:11:23,555 --> 00:11:27,475
When she sees these muscles,
she'll fall in love with me.

183
00:11:30,312 --> 00:11:33,106
It would seem things are changing quickly

184
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,357
within the interim government.

185
00:11:34,441 --> 00:11:39,362
As of this morning, the NRC junta moved
to abolish all political parties,

186
00:11:39,446 --> 00:11:41,907
further consolidating their control
of the government

187
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:44,576
in the wake of the recent military coup.

188
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:46,578
Lieutenant General Sangania,

189
00:11:46,661 --> 00:11:50,874
commander-in-chief of the armed forces
responsible for the junta,

190
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,001
stated in a recent press conference

191
00:11:53,085 --> 00:11:57,047
that it was his intention to rid
the southern regions of the PLF,

192
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:02,635
who he accused of being financed and
supported by foreign institutions.

193
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,264
He also condemned the Native
Defense Force militias,

194
00:12:06,348 --> 00:12:11,519
who he said presented a threat to
the very fabric of national security.

195
00:12:11,603 --> 00:12:14,732
Sangania went on to promise that
the junta would accomplish

196
00:12:14,815 --> 00:12:17,985
what the previous regime had failed to do.

197
00:12:18,068 --> 00:12:22,322
Speculation on the collaboration between
the armed forces and the PLF rebels...

198
00:12:37,838 --> 00:12:40,340
The NRC broke the agreement.

199
00:12:40,966 --> 00:12:43,176
They've entered the buffer zone.

200
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,721
Now they want us to run away
and leave our town.

201
00:12:46,805 --> 00:12:47,931
We cannot do that.

202
00:12:48,015 --> 00:12:49,682
Never.

203
00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:51,894
This land is ours.

204
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,980
Our ancestors have lived here, taken care
of it, and left it for us.

205
00:12:55,063 --> 00:12:57,482
It's our duty to protect it...

206
00:12:57,565 --> 00:13:00,110
and leave it for our children.

207
00:13:02,195 --> 00:13:07,617
So we should send the women
and little children away...

208
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,287
under the protection of ECOMOD.

209
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,916
Where's Dike?

210
00:13:13,999 --> 00:13:19,922
And we who call ourselves men
will stay and protect our town.

211
00:13:21,631 --> 00:13:25,010
Who is going to take care of the property
we are leaving behind?

212
00:13:25,093 --> 00:13:26,719
Dad, where's Dike?

213
00:13:26,804 --> 00:13:27,971
They fled!

214
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:33,518
Let me go, it's my duty.

215
00:13:36,688 --> 00:13:42,652
We will be crushed between the rebels
and the army! It is so bad!

216
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:44,905
We've already decided

217
00:13:44,988 --> 00:13:45,989
what to do with the children.

218
00:13:46,073 --> 00:13:48,116
They will go with you.

219
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,702
He is old. We can't take him anywhere.

220
00:13:50,785 --> 00:13:53,371
You aren't listening to what I'm saying.

221
00:13:53,455 --> 00:13:56,374
Go to your sister in the city,
I'll meet you once everything
is okay here.

222
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:57,625
I can't abandon my responsibilities.

223
00:13:57,709 --> 00:13:58,877
But you are!

224
00:13:58,961 --> 00:14:00,212
Don't think like that.

225
00:14:00,295 --> 00:14:02,464
You want me to be a refugee
in my own country?

226
00:14:02,547 --> 00:14:04,382
With three small children and no husband?

227
00:14:04,466 --> 00:14:05,884
We are a family.

228
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:08,303
We should stay together.

229
00:14:09,304 --> 00:14:11,473
I'm not asking you, I'm telling you.

230
00:14:11,556 --> 00:14:14,101
There are bigger issues to take care of...

231
00:14:14,184 --> 00:14:15,811
It's your turn.

232
00:14:15,894 --> 00:14:17,520
Dad's sending me away.

233
00:14:17,604 --> 00:14:20,648
He's sending you because
you're a little baby.

234
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,443
Play the game.

235
00:14:27,906 --> 00:14:30,075
Turn your light off.

236
00:14:30,158 --> 00:14:32,660
Now turn it on and you'll feel better.

237
00:14:35,914 --> 00:14:38,541
What kind of face is that?

238
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:42,963
Your face is like a monkey's butt.

239
00:14:58,937 --> 00:15:01,439
Come on! Come on! Come on! Hurry up!

240
00:15:03,566 --> 00:15:05,861
Hurry! I see one! Hurry!

241
00:15:05,944 --> 00:15:07,404
Citizens of the republic,
living in the buffer zone.

242
00:15:07,487 --> 00:15:08,488
Hurry!

243
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:12,325
The National Reformation Council
recommend non-combatants

244
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:14,411
to leave the buffer zone immediately...

245
00:15:14,494 --> 00:15:15,954
This one's full. There's another here.

246
00:15:16,038 --> 00:15:17,330
...as military operations
begin as planned.

247
00:15:17,414 --> 00:15:18,623
Wait. Help me.

248
00:15:18,706 --> 00:15:19,791
Is it heavy? Give it to me.

249
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:20,876
Agu, take it.

250
00:15:22,127 --> 00:15:23,628
Please, move. Move!

251
00:15:23,711 --> 00:15:24,837
Move back. Go back.

252
00:15:24,922 --> 00:15:26,173
No space. No space.

253
00:15:26,256 --> 00:15:29,842
Please, please, I am the Section Chief.
This is my family. There must be space.

254
00:15:29,927 --> 00:15:30,928
No space.

255
00:15:31,011 --> 00:15:32,470
This one woman and this
small-small children.

256
00:15:32,554 --> 00:15:34,181
- And the little boy?
- Yes, him, too.

257
00:15:34,264 --> 00:15:36,849
Where are you thinking this woman
and child would be fitted?

258
00:15:36,934 --> 00:15:38,601
They're gonna be sitting
in the front with you.

259
00:15:38,685 --> 00:15:41,021
No, no, no, no, no. Seventy thousand,
no boy.

260
00:15:41,688 --> 00:15:42,689
With the boy.

261
00:15:42,772 --> 00:15:44,900
You wanting your woman to walk
through the bush to the capital?

262
00:15:44,983 --> 00:15:47,152
I'd rather walk. I can't leave my child.

263
00:15:47,235 --> 00:15:48,236
You can't walk!

264
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,487
Please, how much to fit the boy?

265
00:15:49,571 --> 00:15:50,948
Seventy thousand, no boy.

266
00:15:50,948 --> 00:15:51,949
- Seventy thousand, no boy.
- Driver! Driver, driver!

267
00:15:52,032 --> 00:15:54,117
Please, please, please. Hey, hey.
With the boy!

268
00:15:54,201 --> 00:15:56,703
No boy. No bargaining.

269
00:15:57,287 --> 00:15:58,788
I can't.

270
00:15:59,414 --> 00:16:00,623
Get in!

271
00:16:00,707 --> 00:16:02,000
I'll walk! I won't leave my child!

272
00:16:02,084 --> 00:16:03,460
There's no other way! Get in!

273
00:16:07,005 --> 00:16:09,632
Give her to her mother!

274
00:16:10,633 --> 00:16:12,135
Give her to her mother!

275
00:16:16,098 --> 00:16:18,475
Remember to pray to God everyday.

276
00:16:18,558 --> 00:16:22,145
I'll see you very soon.

277
00:16:22,229 --> 00:16:23,771
Always pray! Don't be afraid!

278
00:16:23,855 --> 00:16:25,315
I will see you soon!

279
00:16:25,398 --> 00:16:27,109
We'll find you, okay?

280
00:16:29,569 --> 00:16:32,990
It's full! Everyone get back!

281
00:16:33,073 --> 00:16:34,324
We'll find you!

282
00:16:34,407 --> 00:16:35,658
Everything will be alright!

283
00:16:37,702 --> 00:16:38,703
Take this!

284
00:16:42,415 --> 00:16:44,584
You're with the men now, keep quiet.

285
00:16:45,418 --> 00:16:46,419
Calm down.

286
00:16:50,298 --> 00:16:52,342
Calm down.

287
00:16:53,926 --> 00:16:57,472
Agu! Agu! Agu!

288
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,739
Let's go.

289
00:17:14,822 --> 00:17:16,824
Let's go home.

290
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:21,829
And this is how it is starting.

291
00:17:36,094 --> 00:17:38,513
Go take the clothes out of the rain.

292
00:17:38,596 --> 00:17:40,848
Agu, close the windows.

293
00:17:50,317 --> 00:17:54,654
God, when I'm closing my eyes,

294
00:17:54,737 --> 00:17:58,283
I am seeing the rainy season
in my village.

295
00:17:58,366 --> 00:18:03,288
You can be finding the ground is
washing away beneath your feet.

296
00:18:03,371 --> 00:18:08,960
Nothing is ever for sure...and
everything is always changing.

297
00:18:31,191 --> 00:18:32,609
Agu! Agu!

298
00:18:45,288 --> 00:18:46,581
Hey.

299
00:18:51,544 --> 00:18:53,588
Come on! Hurry!

300
00:18:53,671 --> 00:18:55,798
Stay here. I'll call you when it's clear.

301
00:19:07,477 --> 00:19:09,437
Hey! Hey, hey!

302
00:19:11,523 --> 00:19:13,233
Come on!

303
00:19:15,318 --> 00:19:17,154
Hey!

304
00:19:22,742 --> 00:19:24,369
Hurry!

305
00:19:25,537 --> 00:19:26,538
Hurry!

306
00:19:43,263 --> 00:19:45,097
We need to go. If they catch us...

307
00:19:46,266 --> 00:19:48,017
Keep quiet. They'll hear us.

308
00:19:53,315 --> 00:19:56,318
If we run away now, they won't see us.

309
00:19:56,984 --> 00:19:59,946
Be patient. The soldiers are outside.

310
00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:02,449
If you talk, they'll find us. Keep quiet.

311
00:20:24,346 --> 00:20:25,347
Agu...

312
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,973
whatever happens...

313
00:20:27,056 --> 00:20:28,558
it's God testing us.

314
00:20:28,641 --> 00:20:31,311
We have to be strong.

315
00:20:41,863 --> 00:20:43,823
We have to go.

316
00:20:45,867 --> 00:20:47,535
Open it.

317
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:49,036
Don't do it!

318
00:20:59,297 --> 00:21:00,298
Please.

319
00:21:04,135 --> 00:21:06,178
Turn around! Turn around!

320
00:21:06,263 --> 00:21:08,139
Give me a rope!

321
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,057
I will kill you today.

322
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:13,936
Quiet.

323
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,021
Y'all shut your mouth!

324
00:21:15,021 --> 00:21:16,523
- Y'all shut your mouth!
- Shut your fuckin' mouth!

325
00:21:17,357 --> 00:21:18,650
Which faction do you fight for?

326
00:21:18,733 --> 00:21:19,567
No faction.

327
00:21:19,567 --> 00:21:20,818
- No faction.
- We are not fighters.

328
00:21:20,902 --> 00:21:23,280
We are from this town.

329
00:21:23,363 --> 00:21:25,365
We are protecting the stores.

330
00:21:25,448 --> 00:21:26,824
You are Native Defense Forces, hmm?

331
00:21:26,824 --> 00:21:27,825
- You are Native Defense Forces, hmm?
- No.

332
00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:30,662
I am the Section Chief. We are trying
to stop the looters.

333
00:21:30,745 --> 00:21:32,372
Bring the woman.

334
00:21:32,455 --> 00:21:33,790
You are calling us looters.

335
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,417
- You are calling us looters.
- No. No. No, no, no.

336
00:21:39,587 --> 00:21:41,298
You fuckin' shit. Quiet!

337
00:21:41,381 --> 00:21:43,090
No, no.

338
00:21:44,717 --> 00:21:46,010
Do you know these men?

339
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:48,137
- Do you know these men?
- Master, master, master, please. Please.

340
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,265
This woman, everybody knows she's crazy.

341
00:21:50,348 --> 00:21:51,349
I don't know them.

342
00:21:51,433 --> 00:21:54,143
Master! Master, talk to her and you know
that she's not right in the head.

343
00:21:54,226 --> 00:21:56,103
They are not from here.
They must be rebels.

344
00:21:56,187 --> 00:21:57,480
We are not rebels.

345
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,820
We, the armed forces of the National
Reformation Council,

346
00:22:03,903 --> 00:22:04,904
find you all to be spies.

347
00:22:04,987 --> 00:22:05,988
- No!
- Please!

348
00:22:06,072 --> 00:22:09,576
I sentence you to immediate
and summary execution.

349
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:11,328
Waste them.

350
00:22:11,411 --> 00:22:12,579
Run!

351
00:22:12,662 --> 00:22:14,246
Run!

352
00:22:14,331 --> 00:22:15,832
Run!

353
00:22:18,335 --> 00:22:19,752
Please, please, please.

354
00:27:12,754 --> 00:27:14,296
Kill them all!

355
00:27:15,589 --> 00:27:16,799
You! Hey!

356
00:27:25,057 --> 00:27:26,976
Cease fire!

357
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:32,064
Wanna die, fucking PLF?

358
00:27:32,064 --> 00:27:32,899
- Wanna die, fucking PLF?
- Fucking rebel.

359
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,985
Tie this fucking spongebag up.

360
00:27:37,528 --> 00:27:39,822
Hurry! Hurry!

361
00:27:39,906 --> 00:27:41,115
I'm gonna kill you, man!

362
00:27:41,115 --> 00:27:41,991
- I'm gonna kill you, man!
- This is not the right place.

363
00:27:43,492 --> 00:27:44,535
Take position.

364
00:27:44,618 --> 00:27:45,828
CO Hope, take your man.

365
00:27:45,912 --> 00:27:47,454
I'm gonna kill you.

366
00:27:47,454 --> 00:27:48,414
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Fucking PLF!

367
00:27:49,331 --> 00:27:50,624
Strip those PLF soldiers!

368
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:51,709
Strip them.

369
00:27:51,793 --> 00:27:53,419
Move, move!

370
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:04,138
Hey, you! Keep your eyes down.

371
00:28:04,221 --> 00:28:07,224
Don't look at me.

372
00:28:07,308 --> 00:28:10,978
Everybody move! Here comes the Commandant.

373
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,524
You get out of the fucking way!

374
00:28:21,238 --> 00:28:23,783
What is this thing doing here?

375
00:28:25,785 --> 00:28:28,788
Who is responsible for bringing
this thing?

376
00:28:33,793 --> 00:28:36,796
Strika, is it you that is bringing
this thing?

377
00:28:39,173 --> 00:28:42,677
Strika, untie him.

378
00:28:44,261 --> 00:28:45,680
So all of you grown men,

379
00:28:45,763 --> 00:28:49,767
it is Strika, the small boy, that
is finding this prisoner.

380
00:28:51,393 --> 00:28:52,687
Where is Two-I-C?

381
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:53,980
Two-I-C!

382
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,106
- Two-I-C!
- Two-I-C!

383
00:28:55,189 --> 00:28:56,232
Two-I-C!

384
00:28:57,817 --> 00:28:59,318
Commandant, sir!

385
00:28:59,401 --> 00:29:03,114
Two-I-C, what are we to
be doing with this thing?

386
00:29:03,906 --> 00:29:06,826
This thing? It is just a boy.

387
00:29:07,576 --> 00:29:09,203
A boy?

388
00:29:11,706 --> 00:29:13,665
A boy is nothing.

389
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,584
A boy is harmless?

390
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:16,878
Harmless, no, sir!

391
00:29:16,961 --> 00:29:18,462
Does a boy have two eyes to see?

392
00:29:18,545 --> 00:29:19,964
Two eyes, sir!

393
00:29:20,047 --> 00:29:22,967
A boy has hands to strangle
and fingers to pull triggers.

394
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:25,136
Why you saying a boy is nothing? Huh?

395
00:29:25,219 --> 00:29:28,472
A boy is very, very dangerous.
You understand me?

396
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,726
Very dangerous, you understand?

397
00:29:31,726 --> 00:29:32,643
- Very dangerous, you understand?
- Yes, sir!

398
00:29:32,727 --> 00:29:33,644
Huh?

399
00:29:33,644 --> 00:29:34,686
- Huh?
- Yes, sir!

400
00:29:34,771 --> 00:29:38,232
Strika, are you hungry?

401
00:29:38,315 --> 00:29:41,443
Are you wanting to be eating this thing?

402
00:29:46,323 --> 00:29:48,159
Let me see your hands.

403
00:29:52,371 --> 00:29:55,249
Oh, you have hands like a baby.

404
00:30:03,174 --> 00:30:05,009
What are you doing here?

405
00:30:08,637 --> 00:30:10,139
You should be telling me.

406
00:30:10,222 --> 00:30:12,016
If you are telling me,
I will be helping you.

407
00:30:12,099 --> 00:30:14,936
You see, Strika is hungry.
He will eat you.

408
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:16,187
Huh?

409
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:18,230
What are you doing here?

410
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:30,117
The government army killed my father
and my big brother...

411
00:30:31,285 --> 00:30:36,207
and my father told me to run
into the bush.

412
00:30:42,713 --> 00:30:44,756
Everybody here is calling me Commandant.

413
00:30:44,841 --> 00:30:46,175
How does the Commandant look?

414
00:30:46,175 --> 00:30:47,259
- How does the Commandant look?
- Alright, sir!

415
00:30:47,343 --> 00:30:48,510
How does the Commandant look?

416
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,345
- How does the Commandant look?
- Alright, sir!

417
00:30:49,428 --> 00:30:51,138
Ah.

418
00:30:51,222 --> 00:30:53,599
Now, what are they calling you?

419
00:30:54,433 --> 00:30:55,434
Agu.

420
00:30:55,517 --> 00:30:57,728
Oh, you must say it like you are prouder!

421
00:30:57,812 --> 00:30:59,355
Agu.

422
00:30:59,438 --> 00:31:00,857
One more time.

423
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,773
Agu.

424
00:31:01,773 --> 00:31:02,649
- Agu.
- Uh-huh.

425
00:31:02,733 --> 00:31:04,902
Well, Agu,

426
00:31:04,986 --> 00:31:07,864
that is what I will be
calling you then, eh?

427
00:31:15,287 --> 00:31:20,542
Leave this one under my charge.
I will be training him to be a warrior.

428
00:31:20,626 --> 00:31:23,254
So you can be fighting the army
that is killing your father.

429
00:31:23,337 --> 00:31:27,174
Is that what you want?
You must be saying yes!

430
00:31:27,258 --> 00:31:28,550
Formation!

431
00:31:28,634 --> 00:31:29,510
Say yes!

432
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,344
- Say yes!
- Yes.

433
00:31:30,427 --> 00:31:31,512
Yes, sir!

434
00:31:31,512 --> 00:31:32,346
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

435
00:31:32,429 --> 00:31:34,306
Yes, sir!

436
00:31:34,306 --> 00:31:35,349
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

437
00:31:35,432 --> 00:31:36,267
Yes, sir!

438
00:31:36,267 --> 00:31:37,101
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

439
00:31:37,184 --> 00:31:38,727
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

440
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:39,854
One more time.

441
00:31:39,854 --> 00:31:40,729
- One more time.
- Yes, sir!

442
00:31:40,812 --> 00:31:41,688
One more time. Mmm-hmm.

443
00:31:41,688 --> 00:31:42,814
- One more time. Mmm-hmm.
- Yes, sir!

444
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:43,900
Yes, sir!

445
00:31:43,983 --> 00:31:45,109
- Again.
- Yes, sir!

446
00:31:45,192 --> 00:31:46,027
Again.

447
00:31:46,027 --> 00:31:46,903
- Again.
- Yes, sir!

448
00:31:46,986 --> 00:31:48,237
- Again.
- Yes, sir!

449
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,073
Rambo, give this SBU some work.

450
00:31:52,241 --> 00:31:53,700
You must carry this one.

451
00:31:53,784 --> 00:31:57,788
I saved your life. I saved your life.

452
00:31:57,872 --> 00:31:59,790
I saved your life. Go!

453
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:02,084
Straight line, straight line!

454
00:32:02,168 --> 00:32:03,044
NDF!

455
00:32:03,044 --> 00:32:03,878
- NDF!
- Yes, sir!

456
00:32:04,753 --> 00:32:05,587
Move out.

457
00:32:05,587 --> 00:32:06,422
- Move out.
- Soldier, move!

458
00:32:07,381 --> 00:32:08,424
What are you waiting for?

459
00:32:08,507 --> 00:32:10,426
Move! Quick, quick, quick.

460
00:32:11,218 --> 00:32:13,637
Move it! Move it! Move it! Move it!

461
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,683
Move! Move! Move it!

462
00:32:18,809 --> 00:32:19,768
Move out!

463
00:32:19,768 --> 00:32:20,644
- Move out!
- Move out!

464
00:32:20,727 --> 00:32:22,521
Move, move, move, move.

465
00:32:30,654 --> 00:32:31,738
Move, move, move.

466
00:32:51,842 --> 00:32:53,219
Move it!

467
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,367
- Yes, Commandant, sir!
- Yes, sir!

468
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:00,577
- Commandant, sir!
- Yes, sir!

469
00:34:15,717 --> 00:34:17,303
- How our Commandant look?
- Alright, sir!

470
00:34:17,386 --> 00:34:18,720
- How our Commandant look?
- Alright, sir.

471
00:34:18,804 --> 00:34:19,721
How the Commandant look?

472
00:34:19,721 --> 00:34:20,722
- How the Commandant look?
- Alright, sir!

473
00:34:20,806 --> 00:34:22,308
- How our Commandant look?
- Alright, sir!

474
00:34:22,391 --> 00:34:24,518
You are now under NDF control.

475
00:34:24,601 --> 00:34:26,937
If you're willing to stay, then stay.

476
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:29,106
But you must be initiated.

477
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,024
Am I clear?

478
00:34:30,024 --> 00:34:30,857
- Am I clear?
- Yes, sir!

479
00:34:30,941 --> 00:34:32,068
They are not understanding me, boys.

480
00:34:32,151 --> 00:34:33,485
Show them what I'm talking about.

481
00:34:33,569 --> 00:34:34,945
Raise...put up your fucking hands!

482
00:34:34,945 --> 00:34:36,655
- Raise...put up your fucking hands!
- Check them, check them. Make sure...

483
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,956
Bring me the small boy.

484
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,166
This way.

485
00:34:48,459 --> 00:34:50,461
CO Hope!

486
00:34:54,631 --> 00:34:56,050
Yes, sir.

487
00:34:56,133 --> 00:35:00,346
This baby boy is your responsibility now.
Train him.

488
00:35:00,429 --> 00:35:04,058
Yes, sir! Come over.

489
00:35:04,141 --> 00:35:08,104
Come over! Fucking move!
Let's move. Move. Move.

490
00:35:43,013 --> 00:35:44,098
Move.

491
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,059
Please, can I have some of the food?

492
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:48,935
Please, can I have some of the food?

493
00:35:50,604 --> 00:35:52,731
You think you are soldier now, eh?

494
00:35:52,814 --> 00:35:55,942
You's nothing. You're no
doing nothing here.

495
00:35:56,693 --> 00:35:59,571
I carry ammunition all day.

496
00:35:59,655 --> 00:36:03,200
You! Hey! Hey! Move!

497
00:36:03,284 --> 00:36:04,243
What? What I do?

498
00:36:04,243 --> 00:36:05,327
- What? What I do?
- Wake up!

499
00:36:07,413 --> 00:36:09,206
You go back and stand on top of the chair.

500
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:10,291
Do it!

501
00:36:10,374 --> 00:36:12,626
I said go and stand on top of the chair!

502
00:36:12,709 --> 00:36:15,712
Yeah. And salute!

503
00:36:17,298 --> 00:36:20,259
Two-I-C, go and call Strika to my house.

504
00:36:20,342 --> 00:36:23,470
CO Hope! Send Strika to Commandant!

505
00:36:25,264 --> 00:36:26,640
Strika, go.

506
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,478
Where you go get this thing from?

507
00:36:31,562 --> 00:36:34,398
Two-I-C tell me to train this boy.

508
00:36:46,868 --> 00:36:50,206
Show me position! Make sure you are clear.
Move them, now!

509
00:36:50,289 --> 00:36:51,290
Yes, sir!

510
00:36:51,373 --> 00:36:53,375
First group, move!

511
00:36:56,878 --> 00:36:59,423
You stay together! You stay together!

512
00:36:59,506 --> 00:37:01,967
Close the space. You're too far.

513
00:37:02,759 --> 00:37:05,887
Where are you looking at?
Where are you looking? Eh?

514
00:37:05,971 --> 00:37:07,348
Look at your enemy.

515
00:37:07,431 --> 00:37:08,974
Change!

516
00:37:09,057 --> 00:37:13,854
God...I want to be seeing
my mother again.

517
00:37:13,937 --> 00:37:18,942
Two-I-C is saying, small-small
we are winning this war.

518
00:37:19,025 --> 00:37:23,614
And then if you are willing,
I can be finding her again.

519
00:37:24,906 --> 00:37:27,409
But, only you know.

520
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:34,165
The National Reformation Council
took advantage of this instability

521
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:38,462
and militarily seized power
to restore UPC dominance.

522
00:37:38,545 --> 00:37:42,466
We NDF refuse to recognize
this illegitimate government.

523
00:37:42,549 --> 00:37:43,675
Who are we?

524
00:37:43,675 --> 00:37:44,801
- Who are we?
- We are NDF.

525
00:37:44,885 --> 00:37:46,136
I said who are we?

526
00:37:46,136 --> 00:37:47,554
- I said who are we?
- We are NDF!

527
00:37:47,638 --> 00:37:50,974
Our very own politicians,
who steal our resources

528
00:37:51,057 --> 00:37:55,020
and give them away for small-small dollar
in exchange for private pay-offs,

529
00:37:55,103 --> 00:37:57,147
they are spit on the constitution!

530
00:37:57,231 --> 00:37:59,316
They are spit on your rights!

531
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,652
They are trying to spit on your future!

532
00:38:01,735 --> 00:38:03,445
I say, who is your Supreme Commandant?

533
00:38:03,529 --> 00:38:04,738
Dada Goodblood!

534
00:38:04,821 --> 00:38:05,739
I say, who do you fight for?

535
00:38:05,739 --> 00:38:07,491
- I say, who do you fight for?
- Dada Goodblood!

536
00:38:08,575 --> 00:38:11,119
In the battlefield, you not
be thinking normally.

537
00:38:11,202 --> 00:38:12,037
Do you hear me?

538
00:38:12,037 --> 00:38:12,871
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir!

539
00:38:12,954 --> 00:38:16,708
The only thing mattering
is the mission of the NDF!

540
00:38:16,792 --> 00:38:17,626
Am I clear?

541
00:38:17,626 --> 00:38:18,669
- Am I clear?
- Yes, sir!

542
00:38:18,752 --> 00:38:20,211
- Soldiers, are you hearing me?
- Yes, sir!

543
00:38:20,296 --> 00:38:23,173
You fight and kill anyone
who destroys the peace.

544
00:38:23,257 --> 00:38:24,258
Yes, sir!

545
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:56,332
Offside, offside! That's what I saw.
Offside, offside! Offside!

546
00:39:01,795 --> 00:39:03,171
Hey, stop it!

547
00:39:04,548 --> 00:39:05,882
Alright, stop it!

548
00:39:12,514 --> 00:39:14,224
Native Defense Forces!

549
00:39:15,767 --> 00:39:17,478
How does your Commandant look?

550
00:39:17,478 --> 00:39:18,645
- How does your Commandant look?
- Alright, sir!

551
00:39:18,729 --> 00:39:20,105
How does your Commandant look?

552
00:39:20,105 --> 00:39:22,399
- How does your Commandant look?
- Alright, sir!

553
00:39:23,525 --> 00:39:29,823
What is it that has brought this
big family of strangers together?

554
00:39:31,074 --> 00:39:32,283
Was it fear?

555
00:39:32,283 --> 00:39:33,494
- Was it fear?
- No, sir!

556
00:39:33,577 --> 00:39:34,536
Was it war?

557
00:39:34,536 --> 00:39:35,412
- Was it war?
- Yes, sir!

558
00:39:35,496 --> 00:39:38,415
We were defending ourselves.

559
00:39:38,499 --> 00:39:41,627
We have to get revenge. Huh?

560
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:43,086
We have been defending ourselves

561
00:39:43,169 --> 00:39:46,965
against the killings and rapings
of our own people from the PLF

562
00:39:47,048 --> 00:39:49,635
and now from the NRC junta.

563
00:39:50,552 --> 00:39:54,180
But it has awakened a sleeping beast.

564
00:39:54,264 --> 00:39:56,600
It has awakened a giant.

565
00:39:56,683 --> 00:39:59,895
It has put the weapons of this war
back in the hands of you,

566
00:39:59,978 --> 00:40:04,065
the young and, therefore, the powerful.

567
00:40:05,233 --> 00:40:08,069
Young men! Wealth?

568
00:40:08,153 --> 00:40:12,198
We will not wait to inherit any wealth.
Huh?

569
00:40:12,282 --> 00:40:14,368
We will not wait for them
to come and give it to us.

570
00:40:14,451 --> 00:40:15,744
No, sir!

571
00:40:15,827 --> 00:40:18,204
We are going to take it.

572
00:40:18,204 --> 00:40:19,915
- We are going to take it.
- Yes, sir!

573
00:40:19,998 --> 00:40:21,291
We're going to take it from them.

574
00:40:21,291 --> 00:40:22,543
- We're going to take it from them.
- Yes, sir!

575
00:40:22,626 --> 00:40:23,502
Seize it!

576
00:40:23,502 --> 00:40:24,586
- Seize it!
- Yes, sir!

577
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:28,382
All of you that have never
been listened to before

578
00:40:28,465 --> 00:40:31,593
and have seen your family killed, huh,

579
00:40:31,677 --> 00:40:35,681
you now have something
that stands for you.

580
00:40:35,764 --> 00:40:37,933
You now have something
that stands for you!

581
00:40:39,184 --> 00:40:40,602
That is your defense.

582
00:40:40,602 --> 00:40:42,103
That is your defense.

583
00:40:42,938 --> 00:40:44,731
That is your family's blood.

584
00:40:44,731 --> 00:40:46,232
- That is your family's blood.
- Yes, sir!

585
00:40:46,316 --> 00:40:47,150
Victory!

586
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,068
- Victory!
- Victory!

587
00:40:48,151 --> 00:40:49,027
Victory!

588
00:40:49,027 --> 00:40:49,986
- Victory!
- Victory!

589
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,071
We are going to seize it!

590
00:40:51,071 --> 00:40:51,947
- We are going to seize it!
- Victory!

591
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:52,864
Victory!

592
00:40:52,864 --> 00:40:54,199
- Victory!
- Victory!

593
00:40:59,162 --> 00:41:01,289
You are my family.

594
00:42:45,769 --> 00:42:48,188
You must die...

595
00:42:48,271 --> 00:42:49,898
before you are reborn.

596
00:43:26,768 --> 00:43:29,312
The spirits have blessed you...

597
00:43:29,896 --> 00:43:32,899
and cleansed you.

598
00:43:32,983 --> 00:43:35,694
To the enemy, you are invincible.

599
00:43:37,445 --> 00:43:41,617
But there are rules we must follow...

600
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,744
to keep the spirits happy...

601
00:43:46,496 --> 00:43:48,665
to remain pure.

602
00:44:05,556 --> 00:44:08,143
Enemy never see you again!

603
00:44:08,226 --> 00:44:11,605
You are fortified!
You are fortified, eh?

604
00:44:13,064 --> 00:44:14,149
Hey!

605
00:44:17,527 --> 00:44:19,445
Our enjoyment is over.

606
00:44:19,529 --> 00:44:21,823
Now it is time for war.
We are warring.

607
00:44:22,532 --> 00:44:25,035
We did enjoy our camp...

608
00:44:25,827 --> 00:44:29,039
but from here we are moving.

609
00:44:29,122 --> 00:44:33,418
Moving forward. We are not to stay here.

610
00:44:34,544 --> 00:44:37,798
Don't be leaving anything
for the enemy to be using.

611
00:44:37,881 --> 00:44:40,091
We are going to burn it down.

612
00:44:42,343 --> 00:44:43,386
Am I clear?

613
00:44:43,386 --> 00:44:45,263
- Am I clear?
- Yes, sir!

614
00:44:45,346 --> 00:44:46,306
You are dismissed.

615
00:44:46,306 --> 00:44:47,223
- You are dismissed.
- Yes, sir. Thank you.

616
00:44:47,307 --> 00:44:48,767
COs dismissed!

617
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,642
- COs dismissed!
- Thank you, sir.

618
00:44:49,726 --> 00:44:52,437
All of you, pack your weapons.
Be ready to move.

619
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,314
Moving out in one hour!

620
00:44:55,565 --> 00:44:57,650
Ah-ha! Make sure this thing is burned.

621
00:44:57,734 --> 00:44:58,819
- The whole place!
- Yes, sir!

622
00:44:58,902 --> 00:45:00,987
Don't make me be waiting for you, soldiers!

623
00:45:01,071 --> 00:45:02,363
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

624
00:45:08,161 --> 00:45:09,746
Got all of it?

625
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:12,165
We are leaving nothing for them to find.

626
00:45:24,928 --> 00:45:26,221
Burn it down!

627
00:45:26,304 --> 00:45:27,638
All of it!

628
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:50,411
Iron Jacket. This is Supremo.

629
00:45:50,495 --> 00:45:52,580
You are loud, Supremo.

630
00:45:52,663 --> 00:45:54,040
Report.

631
00:45:54,124 --> 00:45:56,376
We are supplied and moving. Over.

632
00:45:56,459 --> 00:45:58,419
Make sure all the guns are clean.

633
00:45:58,503 --> 00:45:59,838
Strike at your first opportunity.

634
00:45:59,921 --> 00:46:01,256
They have been buried for a long time.

635
00:46:01,339 --> 00:46:02,340
Make sure they work.

636
00:46:02,423 --> 00:46:04,384
Seize supplies. Map victories.

637
00:46:04,467 --> 00:46:07,178
This will keep the spirit up,
despite the UN embargo.

638
00:46:07,262 --> 00:46:09,555
Roger. Well copied, sir.

639
00:46:09,639 --> 00:46:11,975
Our fight is a just one.

640
00:46:12,058 --> 00:46:15,728
Being a freedom fighter is discipline,
obedience and loyalty.

641
00:46:15,812 --> 00:46:16,813
Roger.

642
00:46:16,897 --> 00:46:20,191
We remain ever loyal to Supreme HQ, sir.

643
00:46:20,275 --> 00:46:22,819
Standing by for future orders. Over.

644
00:46:22,903 --> 00:46:26,489
Keep moving. Keep fighting.
Over and out.

645
00:46:27,783 --> 00:46:29,910
This here. This is the route
where we are now.

646
00:46:29,993 --> 00:46:32,370
Listen. From here, we must go down.

647
00:46:32,453 --> 00:46:33,704
And wait by that road there.

648
00:46:33,789 --> 00:46:35,331
Because I think something
is coming across there.

649
00:46:35,415 --> 00:46:36,582
Yes, sir.

650
00:46:51,181 --> 00:46:53,016
Move. Move!

651
00:46:58,646 --> 00:47:00,731
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Agu! Agu!

652
00:47:00,816 --> 00:47:02,818
Come. Come.

653
00:47:04,444 --> 00:47:05,445
Hey!

654
00:47:07,197 --> 00:47:11,910
Hey! Why? Where do you go?
Come over! Fuck! Fly!

655
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:37,768
Preacher, give me the ganja.

656
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:42,858
Hey, hey.

657
00:47:57,038 --> 00:47:59,749
Agu, you know, ambush rule
number one, no noise.

658
00:47:59,832 --> 00:48:02,919
You keep quiet. Keep very quiet.

659
00:48:03,003 --> 00:48:05,463
If even a snake bite your legs,
you keep quiet.

660
00:48:05,546 --> 00:48:06,839
You get hit, you keep quiet.

661
00:48:06,923 --> 00:48:09,509
What is the rule number one in ambush?

662
00:48:09,592 --> 00:48:11,636
No talking, even if snake is biting you.

663
00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:13,471
Okay.

664
00:48:13,554 --> 00:48:16,807
You talk, enemies come around,
we all go die.

665
00:48:17,767 --> 00:48:18,935
Right.

666
00:48:22,438 --> 00:48:24,399
Psst! Psst! Enemies.

667
00:48:29,195 --> 00:48:32,782
They are coming. Everybody, be quiet.
They are coming.

668
00:49:21,789 --> 00:49:23,041
Get ready.

669
00:49:25,293 --> 00:49:26,836
Go, go, go.

670
00:49:31,882 --> 00:49:33,218
RPG! RPG!

671
00:49:47,482 --> 00:49:49,985
Agu! Ammo!

672
00:49:50,901 --> 00:49:52,528
Ammo!

673
00:49:53,154 --> 00:49:55,240
Hey, you! Go! Cut them off!

674
00:49:56,116 --> 00:49:57,408
Where's the fucking ammo?

675
00:50:01,454 --> 00:50:02,955
...fire!

676
00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:05,000
Cease fire!

677
00:50:05,083 --> 00:50:06,834
Cease fire!

678
00:50:08,044 --> 00:50:11,214
Agu! My ammo box!

679
00:50:11,297 --> 00:50:13,008
You want me to die?

680
00:50:24,144 --> 00:50:26,521
Search this vehicle.
Search all the vehicles.

681
00:50:26,604 --> 00:50:27,438
Yes, sir!

682
00:50:27,438 --> 00:50:28,981
- Yes, sir!
- I want them disarmed.

683
00:50:29,065 --> 00:50:31,067
I want them disrobed.

684
00:50:31,151 --> 00:50:35,238
I want this victory mapped.
Map them. Map this victory.

685
00:50:35,321 --> 00:50:36,447
Controller, map them!

686
00:50:36,447 --> 00:50:38,324
- Controller, map them!
- Yes, sir!

687
00:50:38,408 --> 00:50:41,619
This vehicle, all the bodies, I
want them pockets searched.

688
00:50:42,912 --> 00:50:46,957
All of it! Search them good-good.

689
00:50:53,756 --> 00:50:54,590
Pack it up.

690
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:55,425
- Pack it up.
- Sir.

691
00:50:55,508 --> 00:50:56,759
Ah-ha!

692
00:50:56,842 --> 00:50:58,511
Go and bring me my charge.

693
00:50:58,594 --> 00:50:59,637
Agu!

694
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:00,888
Sir! I find this.

695
00:51:00,888 --> 00:51:01,931
- Sir! I find this.
- Why don't you open it?

696
00:51:02,014 --> 00:51:03,433
I find this.

697
00:51:03,516 --> 00:51:04,725
Oh!

698
00:51:05,601 --> 00:51:06,894
Uh-huh.

699
00:51:10,315 --> 00:51:11,357
Yes.

700
00:51:11,441 --> 00:51:12,525
Agu!

701
00:51:16,028 --> 00:51:17,155
Where is he?

702
00:51:17,238 --> 00:51:18,323
Agu!

703
00:51:20,283 --> 00:51:21,659
Go shut your fucking mouth.

704
00:51:25,871 --> 00:51:27,165
Yes, sir!

705
00:51:29,334 --> 00:51:30,793
Agu, you are going to kill this man.

706
00:51:30,876 --> 00:51:33,879
Please. I'm supposed to
be fixing the bridges.

707
00:51:33,963 --> 00:51:35,215
You are going to kill him today.

708
00:51:35,298 --> 00:51:36,841
I not be a soldier. Please, sir.

709
00:51:37,383 --> 00:51:41,262
I'm an engineering student from
the university in the capital.

710
00:51:41,346 --> 00:51:42,763
I'm supposed to be fixing the bridges,

711
00:51:42,847 --> 00:51:45,641
- not be a...
- Shut up!

712
00:51:45,725 --> 00:51:46,809
Shut your mouth.

713
00:51:46,892 --> 00:51:49,812
Pass me something for this guy.

714
00:51:51,356 --> 00:51:52,857
- Nah, that's too big.
- It will be cutlass.

715
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:54,275
Yeah, I see.

716
00:51:54,359 --> 00:51:55,360
Does he have strength for this?

717
00:51:55,443 --> 00:51:59,280
Yeah, he is strong. You can do it.
Preacher, put him on his ass.

718
00:52:01,116 --> 00:52:03,451
Put him on his ass! On his ass!

719
00:52:03,534 --> 00:52:04,827
Agu, come.

720
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:09,582
So when you are chopping wood,
lift up high-high. Up, high.

721
00:52:09,665 --> 00:52:10,791
Uh-huh!

722
00:52:10,875 --> 00:52:17,089
Then when you are ready, you come down
so well-well into the flesh.

723
00:52:17,173 --> 00:52:18,341
You have chopped melon before? Melon?

724
00:52:18,341 --> 00:52:19,259
- You have chopped melon before? Melon?
- Please, no.

725
00:52:19,342 --> 00:52:20,176
Well, this is not a melon.

726
00:52:20,176 --> 00:52:21,010
- Well, this is not a melon.
- Please, no.

727
00:52:21,093 --> 00:52:24,597
I said shut your mouth, huh?
Shut your mouth.

728
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:29,018
You are making it hard.
This is hard.

729
00:52:29,101 --> 00:52:31,854
It's hard, so you must split him good.

730
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:36,901
Huh? Agu, these are the ones
that killed your father.

731
00:52:37,485 --> 00:52:38,528
Huh?

732
00:52:38,611 --> 00:52:39,445
Go on.

733
00:52:39,445 --> 00:52:40,280
Go on.

734
00:52:42,573 --> 00:52:43,658
Shut up!

735
00:52:43,658 --> 00:52:45,160
- Shut up!
- Please. Please.

736
00:52:46,076 --> 00:52:47,453
Agu, go on.

737
00:52:49,121 --> 00:52:50,248
Agu!

738
00:52:51,707 --> 00:52:53,501
Please, no.

739
00:52:53,584 --> 00:52:54,794
Chop him good-good.

740
00:52:54,877 --> 00:52:56,962
Please!

741
00:52:57,505 --> 00:53:00,966
These are the ones, the dogs
that kill your father.

742
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:02,635
Where is your mother?

743
00:53:02,718 --> 00:53:04,094
Please...

744
00:53:04,179 --> 00:53:07,056
Agu, these are the ones
that killed your father!

745
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:09,850
Chop that head!

746
00:53:11,727 --> 00:53:13,020
Chop him!

747
00:53:19,235 --> 00:53:20,861
Agu, come on!

748
00:53:22,238 --> 00:53:23,406
Ahh!

749
00:53:28,786 --> 00:53:30,746
Strika, help your brotha.

750
00:54:09,994 --> 00:54:11,787
Good.

751
00:54:13,623 --> 00:54:14,790
That's right.

752
00:54:14,874 --> 00:54:15,916
Watch his blood.

753
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,628
That is what you call justice. Hmm.

754
00:54:18,711 --> 00:54:22,382
God...I have killed a man.

755
00:54:24,634 --> 00:54:27,262
It is the worst sin...

756
00:54:27,345 --> 00:54:29,597
but I am knowing too,

757
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,308
it is the right thing to be doing.

758
00:54:32,392 --> 00:54:33,225
Tripod!

759
00:54:33,225 --> 00:54:34,059
- Tripod!
- Yes, sir.

760
00:54:34,143 --> 00:54:35,936
This will be the Commandant's car.

761
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:38,981
Take this fucker out.
He is filthy.

762
00:54:39,064 --> 00:54:41,776
Two-I-C! Two-I-C!

763
00:54:43,653 --> 00:54:45,905
Give this to my charge. Huh?

764
00:54:47,532 --> 00:54:49,409
This will be the Commandant's car.

765
00:54:49,409 --> 00:54:50,868
- This will be the Commandant's car.
- Yes, sir.

766
00:54:50,951 --> 00:54:53,788
If you are losing it, then I am losing you.

767
00:54:55,498 --> 00:54:56,582
Hmm!

768
00:54:58,543 --> 00:54:59,544
Uh-huh.

769
00:55:00,295 --> 00:55:01,546
This...

770
00:55:02,797 --> 00:55:04,089
- You are driving?
- Okay to move out.

771
00:55:04,173 --> 00:55:06,551
Everyone, get ready to move out.

772
00:55:06,634 --> 00:55:08,469
Get ready to move out, Agu.

773
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:43,003
You got this stuff from where?

774
00:55:45,923 --> 00:55:47,425
From dead bodies?

775
00:55:55,099 --> 00:55:58,894
Everybody is calling you Strika. Why?

776
00:56:05,067 --> 00:56:06,527
Are you liking war?

777
00:56:09,029 --> 00:56:11,616
Hey, I'm asking you a question,
and you are not talking.

778
00:56:14,494 --> 00:56:16,245
Are you having family?

779
00:56:26,922 --> 00:56:29,467
I am thinking about my mom...

780
00:56:32,845 --> 00:56:34,304
my brother...

781
00:56:36,849 --> 00:56:39,309
and my little sister.

782
00:56:57,953 --> 00:56:59,371
Are you stupid?

783
00:57:02,708 --> 00:57:04,627
Why are you not talking?

784
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:06,295
I am asking a question.
You are not talking.

785
00:57:39,537 --> 00:57:41,456
Go! Go! Fast!

786
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:55,928
Go! Go, go!

787
00:57:58,639 --> 00:58:01,767
I got you, Strika.

788
00:58:33,883 --> 00:58:34,800
Where is he?

789
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:35,635
- Where is he?
- Keep going, keep going.

790
00:58:35,718 --> 00:58:38,721
Grass cutter! Grass cutter!
Grass cutter!

791
00:58:38,804 --> 00:58:39,930
Left, left, left.

792
00:59:19,386 --> 00:59:22,598
And you're having any food that you want,

793
00:59:22,682 --> 00:59:26,226
from chicken, cow, fruit and vegetable...

794
00:59:26,310 --> 00:59:30,898
Any kind of fish that you want, we got.
The fisherman is bringing it from the sea.

795
00:59:30,981 --> 00:59:33,067
There's nothing you cannot have there.

796
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:39,323
And the best thing of this place,
this town of abundant resources,

797
00:59:39,406 --> 00:59:41,826
is the women.

798
00:59:41,909 --> 00:59:46,872
Hey, the women are too beautiful there!
Too beautiful.

799
00:59:46,956 --> 00:59:50,375
Ah! The next thing you know, your soldier
will be standing to attention.

800
00:59:53,503 --> 00:59:57,257
They are having bottoms
with specifications so nice

801
00:59:57,341 --> 01:00:01,804
that the ground where they're
sitting down is also rejoicing.

802
01:00:01,887 --> 01:00:06,601
And they know...they know
how to be treating a man.

803
01:00:06,684 --> 01:00:10,813
How to make him feel good,
kisses and all that, huh?

804
01:00:10,896 --> 01:00:13,816
Last time I was there,
my soldier was hurting.

805
01:00:13,899 --> 01:00:14,900
I couldn't stand up, eh!

806
01:00:17,152 --> 01:00:21,699
But you will see because you
are going there yourselves.

807
01:00:21,782 --> 01:00:22,783
Hmm?

808
01:00:22,867 --> 01:00:25,410
You will see with your own eyes, gentlemen.

809
01:00:25,494 --> 01:00:27,079
Mmm-hmm.

810
01:00:30,499 --> 01:00:31,667
Commandant, sir!

811
01:00:34,962 --> 01:00:36,046
Who is this?

812
01:00:36,046 --> 01:00:38,215
- Who is this?
- Refugees from the village, sir.

813
01:00:38,298 --> 01:00:41,927
They said the PLF and the NRC took
their village three days ago.

814
01:00:42,011 --> 01:00:44,346
They killed most of the town,
but they let these ones go.

815
01:00:44,429 --> 01:00:45,681
Hmm.

816
01:00:49,727 --> 01:00:52,730
Well, let us be giving
their village back, huh?

817
01:00:52,813 --> 01:00:54,106
Yes, sir.

818
01:01:03,616 --> 01:01:04,867
Look at that.

819
01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:07,244
They are cutting people's hands.

820
01:01:08,537 --> 01:01:10,122
Fucking PLF.

821
01:01:37,149 --> 01:01:38,192
Radio!

822
01:01:38,192 --> 01:01:39,276
- Radio!
- Yes, sir.

823
01:01:43,864 --> 01:01:45,490
Two-I-C!

824
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:46,951
- Two-I-C!
- Roger, you are loud.

825
01:01:47,034 --> 01:01:48,285
Report!

826
01:01:48,368 --> 01:01:51,455
Uh, we are facing heavy fire, sir. Over.

827
01:01:51,538 --> 01:01:52,748
Can you take the bridge?

828
01:01:52,832 --> 01:01:55,167
It's very difficult, sir. Men
are fighting bravely,

829
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:57,627
but I don't know if we can hold
too much longer. Over.

830
01:01:57,712 --> 01:01:58,754
Press on!

831
01:01:58,754 --> 01:02:00,297
- Press on!
- Roger. We need support, sir.

832
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:01,924
Some of our men are injured.

833
01:02:02,007 --> 01:02:05,886
The men's spirits are low.
Sir, do you copy?

834
01:02:06,345 --> 01:02:07,179
Sir?

835
01:02:07,179 --> 01:02:09,264
- Sir?
- Can you take the bridge?

836
01:02:09,348 --> 01:02:13,686
Copy, sir. We will re-apply pressure
and push for the bridge. Over.

837
01:02:13,769 --> 01:02:15,062
Take the bridge!

838
01:02:15,145 --> 01:02:16,731
That is your task! Mortar.

839
01:02:16,731 --> 01:02:17,564
- That is your task! Mortar.
- Yes, sir!

840
01:02:17,647 --> 01:02:19,108
Your ammo now!

841
01:02:19,108 --> 01:02:21,276
- Your ammo now!
- Ammunition ready, sir!

842
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:22,695
Stand by!

843
01:02:33,038 --> 01:02:34,790
Agu and Strika.

844
01:02:34,874 --> 01:02:36,041
Yes, sir!

845
01:02:36,125 --> 01:02:41,463
See this thing, huh? This
is a very special device.

846
01:02:41,546 --> 01:02:46,719
We can be seeing the enemy even
when the enemy is hiding.

847
01:02:46,802 --> 01:02:48,971
Come.

848
01:02:49,054 --> 01:02:50,848
Wait, Strika.

849
01:02:53,934 --> 01:02:58,939
Ah! There you go. See our guys.
Look, we are taking them.

850
01:03:00,775 --> 01:03:02,567
You see?

851
01:03:05,612 --> 01:03:06,739
Fire!

852
01:03:16,331 --> 01:03:17,166
See that?

853
01:03:17,166 --> 01:03:18,083
- See that?
- Yeah.

854
01:03:18,167 --> 01:03:20,710
That is magic. Huh?

855
01:03:23,547 --> 01:03:25,590
We want to take that bridge.

856
01:03:26,466 --> 01:03:28,928
Now we are going to take that bridge.

857
01:03:32,765 --> 01:03:34,224
Formation!

858
01:03:34,224 --> 01:03:35,434
- Formation!
- Formation!

859
01:03:35,517 --> 01:03:37,227
That bridge, we are taking it!

860
01:03:37,311 --> 01:03:38,312
Yes, sir.

861
01:03:40,898 --> 01:03:44,109
Better look me in the eyes, motherfucker.

862
01:03:44,193 --> 01:03:46,779
Who wants to fight?
Uh-huh.

863
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:50,074
I'm only taking the brave!

864
01:03:50,157 --> 01:03:52,492
I'm not taking the scared.

865
01:03:53,911 --> 01:03:57,832
I'm not taking no girls.

866
01:03:57,915 --> 01:03:59,124
Are you ready to fight?

867
01:03:59,124 --> 01:03:59,959
- Are you ready to fight?
- Yes, sir!

868
01:04:00,042 --> 01:04:00,918
Are you ready to fight?

869
01:04:00,918 --> 01:04:02,752
- Are you ready to fight?
- Yes, sir!

870
01:04:02,837 --> 01:04:03,963
You want to take that bridge?

871
01:04:03,963 --> 01:04:05,214
- You want to take that bridge?
- Yes, sir!

872
01:04:05,297 --> 01:04:06,548
We're gonna take that fucking bridge?

873
01:04:06,548 --> 01:04:07,466
- We're gonna take that fucking bridge?
- Yes, sir!

874
01:05:16,118 --> 01:05:17,119
Fucking PLF!

875
01:05:17,702 --> 01:05:19,997
Fucking PLF!

876
01:05:20,664 --> 01:05:21,706
No retreat!

877
01:05:21,706 --> 01:05:23,083
- No retreat!
- No surrender!

878
01:05:23,167 --> 01:05:24,043
No retreat!

879
01:05:24,043 --> 01:05:25,127
- No retreat!
- No surrender!

880
01:05:25,210 --> 01:05:27,087
We're moving!

881
01:05:27,171 --> 01:05:28,672
We're moving!

882
01:05:28,755 --> 01:05:30,925
- No retreat!
- No surrender!

883
01:05:31,008 --> 01:05:33,093
We're moving!

884
01:05:41,476 --> 01:05:42,561
No retreat!

885
01:05:42,561 --> 01:05:44,021
- No retreat!
- No surrender!

886
01:06:16,595 --> 01:06:17,930
- Move it!
- Move it!

887
01:06:27,314 --> 01:06:29,149
Move it! Move it!

888
01:06:38,993 --> 01:06:41,036
Move it!

889
01:07:19,199 --> 01:07:22,577
Our Father, from dust we were created.

890
01:07:22,661 --> 01:07:24,329
We shall go back to dust.

891
01:07:24,413 --> 01:07:26,123
Eleven of my men. Gone.

892
01:07:26,206 --> 01:07:29,209
I commit my fellow soldiers
into your hands.

893
01:07:29,293 --> 01:07:32,337
May their soul rest in peace. Amen.

894
01:07:34,339 --> 01:07:38,052
I am now knowing the smell of the dead.

895
01:07:38,135 --> 01:07:40,054
They are sweet like sugarcane

896
01:07:41,013 --> 01:07:44,183
and rotten like palm wine.

897
01:07:44,266 --> 01:07:50,355
And when they stay in the sun, they are
growing plump like brown mangoes.

898
01:08:05,037 --> 01:08:06,163
Very true, sir.

899
01:08:06,246 --> 01:08:07,247
Strika.

900
01:08:18,383 --> 01:08:19,926
What?

901
01:08:20,009 --> 01:08:22,387
You have your next mission. Stand by.

902
01:08:22,471 --> 01:08:24,306
You are loud, Supremo.

903
01:08:24,389 --> 01:08:27,184
Capture the central regions,
capital city, Bov.

904
01:08:27,267 --> 01:08:28,310
When you accomplish that,

905
01:08:28,393 --> 01:08:31,480
I will promulgate an order making you
Brigadier General.

906
01:08:31,563 --> 01:08:34,774
You'll be a general before we
finally seize the capital city.

907
01:08:34,858 --> 01:08:36,693
Yes, sir. It is a challenge, sir.

908
01:08:36,776 --> 01:08:40,197
But I promise you, it's mission possible.
Over.

909
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:41,948
Well, then, next time I see you,

910
01:08:42,031 --> 01:08:43,617
I'll be speaking to a general.

911
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:46,578
And how is your Two-I-C performing? Over.

912
01:08:46,661 --> 01:08:49,498
Two-I-C? Sorry, sir. What
do you mean Two-I-C?

913
01:08:49,581 --> 01:08:51,250
I've always rated that young man.

914
01:08:51,333 --> 01:08:54,211
Well, Two-I-C is a formidable soldier.

915
01:08:54,294 --> 01:08:55,587
Over.

916
01:08:55,670 --> 01:08:57,881
Teach him the ways of a good commander.

917
01:08:57,964 --> 01:08:59,007
Yes, sir.

918
01:08:59,091 --> 01:09:01,135
Now, take Bov. Keep that spirit up,

919
01:09:01,218 --> 01:09:02,886
and bring us closer to victory.

920
01:09:02,969 --> 01:09:05,139
Of course, Supremo. Over.

921
01:09:05,222 --> 01:09:08,392
You want to be a general,
don't you, Commandant?

922
01:09:08,475 --> 01:09:09,559
Yes, sir.

923
01:09:09,559 --> 01:09:11,060
- Yes, sir.
- Earn it. Over and out.

924
01:09:11,145 --> 01:09:12,771
Over and out.

925
01:09:14,439 --> 01:09:16,525
Agu, you fought well today.

926
01:09:16,525 --> 01:09:17,942
- Agu, you fought well today.
- Thank you, sir.

927
01:09:18,943 --> 01:09:21,863
A-ha! What is this?

928
01:09:23,323 --> 01:09:24,491
Ah!

929
01:09:26,034 --> 01:09:27,786
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

930
01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:34,293
Agu, you are wanting to be knowing
how to be leading?

931
01:09:34,376 --> 01:09:36,836
I am happy to be following you, sir.

932
01:09:36,836 --> 01:09:37,837
- I am happy to be following you, sir.
- That is good,

933
01:09:37,921 --> 01:09:42,676
because there is no learning
how to be leading.

934
01:09:42,759 --> 01:09:46,221
Some people are born to be leaders,
others are born to be followers,

935
01:09:46,305 --> 01:09:49,183
and others are just waiting to be dying.

936
01:09:49,266 --> 01:09:50,975
I'm a good follower, sir.

937
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:52,519
- I'm a good follower, sir.
- Agu, you are different.

938
01:09:52,602 --> 01:09:55,355
You are reminding me of when
I was a small boy.

939
01:09:55,439 --> 01:09:59,193
That is how I know you are going
to be a leader.

940
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:02,279
You see, even the best leader

941
01:10:02,362 --> 01:10:06,533
sometimes he must be knowing
how to be a follower.

942
01:10:07,659 --> 01:10:09,578
Ah, even me.

943
01:10:09,661 --> 01:10:15,875
I am following the Supreme Commandant,
even if I am not agreeing.

944
01:10:17,211 --> 01:10:18,337
Huh?

945
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:21,548
Yes, sir. I'm a good follower.

946
01:10:23,883 --> 01:10:25,844
You are seeing this place?

947
01:10:26,553 --> 01:10:29,973
The Commandant is saying
we must take this.

948
01:10:30,056 --> 01:10:31,183
That it is important.

949
01:10:31,266 --> 01:10:35,520
So, hmm, if it is important to him,
it is important to me.

950
01:10:35,604 --> 01:10:36,896
Yes, sir.

951
01:10:38,523 --> 01:10:41,568
Because if we get that,
then we can go to Taro.

952
01:10:50,410 --> 01:10:52,704
That is where your mother is, eh?

953
01:10:52,704 --> 01:10:54,539
- That is where your mother is, eh?
- She is in the capital.

954
01:10:56,375 --> 01:10:59,127
Come, Agu.

955
01:10:59,211 --> 01:11:01,713
After we've been greeted
by Dada Goodblood,

956
01:11:01,796 --> 01:11:04,466
we'll be taking the capital certainly.

957
01:11:08,762 --> 01:11:10,889
Come.

958
01:11:17,229 --> 01:11:19,856
This one has special juju.

959
01:11:19,939 --> 01:11:21,149
Thank you, sir.

960
01:11:21,233 --> 01:11:24,736
You see, I've been wanting to help
you more than the others, Agu,

961
01:11:24,819 --> 01:11:29,032
but you cannot be telling the others
how I'm helping you like this.

962
01:11:29,115 --> 01:11:31,200
It'll have to be our secret.

963
01:11:32,035 --> 01:11:33,620
You are knowing how to keep secret?

964
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:34,454
- You are knowing how to keep secret?
- Yes, sir.

965
01:11:34,538 --> 01:11:36,164
Well, be saying it.

966
01:11:36,164 --> 01:11:38,542
- Well, be saying it.
- I can be keeping this secret, sir.

967
01:11:49,803 --> 01:11:53,348
I'm not punishing you, Agu.
Mmm?

968
01:11:54,391 --> 01:11:56,601
But I do care for you.

969
01:12:15,537 --> 01:12:16,705
Aye.

970
01:12:19,165 --> 01:12:20,750
Agu, kneel down.

971
01:12:28,467 --> 01:12:33,555
Be doing this thing...for me.

972
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:28,943
They are jumping like rabbits.

973
01:13:30,862 --> 01:13:33,448
Move, move to your left.

974
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:40,038
- Go, go. Keep going.
- Go. Keep going.

975
01:13:40,121 --> 01:13:41,498
- Keep going.
- Move, move.

976
01:13:41,581 --> 01:13:43,667
To your left side.

977
01:13:47,796 --> 01:13:48,880
Agu.

978
01:13:50,924 --> 01:13:52,634
Agu?

979
01:13:52,717 --> 01:13:56,220
I don't want that I call you and
you just stand there. Agu?

980
01:13:58,347 --> 01:13:59,766
Come here, I'll give you
some brown-brown.

981
01:13:59,849 --> 01:14:02,811
It'll cure everything for you, eh.

982
01:14:03,395 --> 01:14:06,230
Hey, I didn't call you to stand there.

983
01:14:09,401 --> 01:14:10,485
Hmm?

984
01:14:11,986 --> 01:14:16,115
My boy, what is wrong with you?
What is wrong with you?

985
01:14:17,366 --> 01:14:19,661
Come here, I'll give you
some morale booster.

986
01:14:19,744 --> 01:14:23,122
I think I'll give you that
brown-brown, so...

987
01:14:23,206 --> 01:14:27,251
Morale booster, you know.
Come, come. Here.

988
01:14:30,213 --> 01:14:31,923
Yeah, that my boy.

989
01:14:32,006 --> 01:14:34,759
Yeah. Morale booster, eh?

990
01:14:34,843 --> 01:14:36,970
Make you strong.

991
01:14:37,053 --> 01:14:38,847
More protection.

992
01:14:40,765 --> 01:14:43,893
Nobody is your friend where we are going.

993
01:14:44,936 --> 01:14:47,105
They are the enemy.

994
01:14:47,188 --> 01:14:50,859
They are the farmers that
have fed the enemy.

995
01:14:50,942 --> 01:14:52,736
- The farmers' wives whose breasts...
- Agu. Agu.

996
01:14:52,819 --> 01:14:54,278
...have been feeding babies.

997
01:14:54,362 --> 01:14:56,114
Agu.

998
01:14:56,197 --> 01:14:59,576
That is the nature of the land
that we are going.

999
01:14:59,659 --> 01:15:02,954
The collaborators and the traitors.

1000
01:15:03,788 --> 01:15:06,290
Our people's blood has been flowing
for years.

1001
01:15:06,374 --> 01:15:09,794
That's why it is time for
their blood to flow.

1002
01:15:09,878 --> 01:15:13,131
We will spare nobody.

1003
01:15:13,214 --> 01:15:15,341
We'll spare nobody,

1004
01:15:15,424 --> 01:15:19,095
because they are all enemy, all of them!

1005
01:15:21,139 --> 01:15:22,223
Let us pray.

1006
01:15:24,934 --> 01:15:26,978
God, let us pray.

1007
01:15:28,522 --> 01:15:32,108
He is guiding us with what
we are about to be doing.

1008
01:15:32,191 --> 01:15:33,693
He is helping us.

1009
01:15:35,403 --> 01:15:37,531
Let us fulfill your justice.

1010
01:15:40,074 --> 01:15:41,868
Give us the strength!

1011
01:15:43,870 --> 01:15:46,956
God, we will be sacrificing our blood!

1012
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:50,126
That is why we must spare nobody!

1013
01:15:50,209 --> 01:15:53,004
We will spare nobody!

1014
01:15:53,087 --> 01:15:54,589
Nothing will hurt us.

1015
01:15:58,426 --> 01:16:02,514
Because we are invincible.
We are invincible!

1016
01:16:10,354 --> 01:16:13,399
NDF! NDF!

1017
01:16:13,482 --> 01:16:14,859
- Who are we?
- NDF, sir!

1018
01:16:14,943 --> 01:16:16,194
- Who are we?
- NDF, sir!

1019
01:16:16,277 --> 01:16:17,111
Who are we?

1020
01:16:17,111 --> 01:16:17,987
- Who are we?
- NDF, sir!

1021
01:16:42,095 --> 01:16:44,430
NDF, spare nobody!

1022
01:16:45,139 --> 01:16:46,265
Kill them all!

1023
01:16:46,265 --> 01:16:47,559
Kill them all!

1024
01:16:56,317 --> 01:16:58,737
Come on, move, NDF!
Move, move! Move!

1025
01:17:20,717 --> 01:17:21,593
How the Commandant look?

1026
01:17:21,593 --> 01:17:22,551
- How the Commandant look?
- Alright, sir!

1027
01:17:22,636 --> 01:17:23,511
I say, how the Commandant look?

1028
01:17:23,511 --> 01:17:24,470
- I say, how the Commandant look?
- Alright, sir!

1029
01:17:24,553 --> 01:17:25,972
- How the Commandant look?
- Alright, sir!

1030
01:17:26,055 --> 01:17:26,890
I say, how the Commandant look?

1031
01:17:26,890 --> 01:17:27,724
- I say, how the Commandant look?
- Alright, sir!

1032
01:17:27,807 --> 01:17:28,642
NDF! NDF!

1033
01:17:28,642 --> 01:17:30,769
NDF! NDF!

1034
01:17:30,852 --> 01:17:32,270
- Who are we?
- NDF, sir!

1035
01:17:32,353 --> 01:17:33,562
- Who are we?
- NDF, sir!

1036
01:17:33,647 --> 01:17:34,773
- Who are we?
- NDF, sir!

1037
01:17:34,856 --> 01:17:36,524
- Who are we?
- NDF, sir!

1038
01:17:43,698 --> 01:17:44,699
Agu!

1039
01:17:44,783 --> 01:17:47,744
Shoot them! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!

1040
01:17:53,667 --> 01:17:55,835
Commandant! Sir!

1041
01:17:55,919 --> 01:17:57,796
Leave this one under my charge.

1042
01:17:57,879 --> 01:17:59,798
I will be training him to be a warrior.

1043
01:17:59,881 --> 01:18:01,382
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

1044
01:18:01,465 --> 01:18:02,550
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

1045
01:18:02,634 --> 01:18:03,843
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

1046
01:18:03,927 --> 01:18:05,303
- Yes, sir!
- Again!

1047
01:18:05,386 --> 01:18:06,387
- Yes, sir!
- Again!

1048
01:18:06,470 --> 01:18:07,722
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

1049
01:18:07,722 --> 01:18:08,723
- Yes, sir! Yes, sir!
- Again!

1050
01:18:08,807 --> 01:18:09,974
- Again!
- Yes, sir!

1051
01:18:10,058 --> 01:18:11,184
- Again!
- Yes, sir!

1052
01:18:11,267 --> 01:18:12,518
- Again!
- Yes, sir!

1053
01:18:12,601 --> 01:18:13,978
- Again!
- Yes, sir!

1054
01:18:14,062 --> 01:18:15,021
Again!

1055
01:18:15,021 --> 01:18:15,897
- Again!
- Yes, sir!

1056
01:18:33,497 --> 01:18:36,459
Move, move! Move, move, move! Move!

1057
01:18:36,542 --> 01:18:37,669
Fuck!

1058
01:18:59,858 --> 01:19:02,651
Fuck you! Fucker! Fucker!

1059
01:19:02,651 --> 01:19:04,779
Fuck you! Fucker! Fucker!

1060
01:19:04,863 --> 01:19:05,697
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

1061
01:19:05,697 --> 01:19:07,490
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

1062
01:19:17,876 --> 01:19:19,460
Out, out. Over here.

1063
01:19:19,543 --> 01:19:21,212
Fucking out! Fucking out! Out!

1064
01:19:21,295 --> 01:19:26,509
Fucking out! Out! Get up!
Get up, fuck! Get up! Up!

1065
01:19:31,347 --> 01:19:33,016
Ma...Ma!

1066
01:19:33,099 --> 01:19:34,225
I'm not your mother!

1067
01:19:35,184 --> 01:19:36,394
I'm not your mother!

1068
01:19:36,477 --> 01:19:37,771
I found you!

1069
01:19:38,437 --> 01:19:40,899
What the fuck going on here?

1070
01:19:40,982 --> 01:19:42,650
You know her?

1071
01:19:42,734 --> 01:19:44,402
I was looking for you!

1072
01:19:44,485 --> 01:19:47,822
Where do you know this woman from?
You know her?

1073
01:19:47,906 --> 01:19:49,115
I was looking for you!

1074
01:19:49,198 --> 01:19:51,325
I wanna rape her.

1075
01:19:52,493 --> 01:19:54,287
I wanna rape her!

1076
01:19:56,580 --> 01:19:58,249
You're not my mother!

1077
01:19:58,332 --> 01:20:00,418
Witch woman!

1078
01:20:00,501 --> 01:20:02,545
You're not my mother! You fooled me!

1079
01:20:02,628 --> 01:20:03,963
Witch woman!

1080
01:20:37,789 --> 01:20:42,001
God...are you watching
what we are doing?

1081
01:20:45,296 --> 01:20:47,506
Oh! Why? Shit!

1082
01:20:50,009 --> 01:20:51,845
What the fuck is that?

1083
01:20:52,804 --> 01:20:56,599
You didn't fucking boy, eh?
You didn't fucking, boy.

1084
01:21:27,839 --> 01:21:31,134
You here for die, motherfucker.

1085
01:21:33,094 --> 01:21:37,974
Fuck him up, eh? Fuck you up. Fuck you up.

1086
01:21:45,814 --> 01:21:48,401
Commandant, sir. This is for you, sir.

1087
01:21:56,242 --> 01:21:59,453
From the Supreme Commander.
What does it say?

1088
01:22:09,422 --> 01:22:11,507
Now it is your turn to eat.

1089
01:22:15,594 --> 01:22:17,263
Load the vehicles.

1090
01:22:19,015 --> 01:22:21,017
He is summoning us.

1091
01:22:25,021 --> 01:22:26,855
Did he state a reason?

1092
01:22:28,024 --> 01:22:29,567
Isn't it clear?

1093
01:22:33,571 --> 01:22:34,488
Are we going to Taro?

1094
01:22:34,488 --> 01:22:35,364
Are we going to Taro?

1095
01:22:36,449 --> 01:22:38,701
This guy!

1096
01:22:38,784 --> 01:22:40,619
You can't see my ears?

1097
01:22:43,915 --> 01:22:45,666
What is happening to this one?

1098
01:22:45,749 --> 01:22:48,294
A piece of RPG is hitting his temple.

1099
01:22:48,377 --> 01:22:50,046
I beg you, please, don't shoot me!
Please!

1100
01:22:50,129 --> 01:22:51,589
Hey, keep your eyes down!

1101
01:22:51,589 --> 01:22:52,465
- Hey, keep your eyes down!
- Oi! Oi! Oi!

1102
01:22:52,548 --> 01:22:54,467
What do we do with the civilians?

1103
01:22:55,468 --> 01:22:56,510
Leave one of them alive.

1104
01:22:56,594 --> 01:23:00,264
Send him up north to the next village
and then the next village after that.

1105
01:23:00,348 --> 01:23:03,184
Tell them that we are coming.
It's only the beginning.

1106
01:23:03,267 --> 01:23:04,268
Get on board, everybody.

1107
01:23:04,352 --> 01:23:05,519
- Tripod!
- Yes, sir.

1108
01:23:05,603 --> 01:23:10,358
Take note and act accordingly. Strika
and Agu are now part of my squad.

1109
01:23:10,441 --> 01:23:12,235
Mountain View. Iron Jacket. Over.

1110
01:23:12,318 --> 01:23:13,945
Get in there now! Move!

1111
01:23:14,028 --> 01:23:16,447
We are proceeding to Taro with arms. Over!

1112
01:23:19,283 --> 01:23:20,118
Get in!

1113
01:23:20,118 --> 01:23:21,785
- Get in!
- Okay. Roger.

1114
01:23:21,869 --> 01:23:24,247
Echo, tango, alpha, 1800 hours.

1115
01:23:39,012 --> 01:23:40,138
Tripod!

1116
01:23:40,138 --> 01:23:40,972
- Tripod!
- Yes, sir!

1117
01:23:41,055 --> 01:23:42,723
Guns up!

1118
01:24:01,534 --> 01:24:03,661
Halt! Halt!

1119
01:24:04,495 --> 01:24:05,704
- Enemy or friend?
- Friend!

1120
01:24:05,788 --> 01:24:07,290
- Who are you?
- NDF!

1121
01:24:14,713 --> 01:24:16,424
Who is your commander?

1122
01:24:16,507 --> 01:24:18,301
I am.

1123
01:24:18,384 --> 01:24:21,262
What kind of welcome is this?

1124
01:24:21,345 --> 01:24:24,307
Sorry, sir. You, get in that car.
Take them to HQ.

1125
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:26,434
Clear the way!

1126
01:24:26,517 --> 01:24:27,851
Clear the fuckin' way!

1127
01:24:31,939 --> 01:24:34,317
Right this way. Right this way.

1128
01:24:37,820 --> 01:24:39,113
Fuck you!

1129
01:24:51,709 --> 01:24:55,504
Victory! Victory! Victory!

1130
01:25:28,121 --> 01:25:30,123
Commandant, welcome.

1131
01:25:30,123 --> 01:25:31,165
- Commandant, welcome.
- Hello, Deputy.

1132
01:25:31,249 --> 01:25:33,084
Follow us.

1133
01:25:33,167 --> 01:25:36,629
Weapons are not allowed in here.
So you place them here.

1134
01:25:36,712 --> 01:25:38,714
Leave your weapons, boys.
Soldiers.

1135
01:25:45,471 --> 01:25:48,432
You wait here. Here. Have a seat.

1136
01:25:48,516 --> 01:25:49,725
And you will bring us water?

1137
01:25:50,518 --> 01:25:51,852
Certainly.

1138
01:26:06,867 --> 01:26:08,952
Goodblood will see you now.

1139
01:26:09,703 --> 01:26:10,704
Him.

1140
01:26:35,563 --> 01:26:37,606
Have a seat here.

1141
01:26:52,288 --> 01:26:54,623
Goodblood says this is a token
of appreciation...

1142
01:26:54,707 --> 01:26:57,042
Yo! What are you doing?

1143
01:26:58,336 --> 01:27:03,549
I'm sorry. The Supreme Commander
is so very upset to keep you waiting.

1144
01:27:03,632 --> 01:27:05,759
Please, will you follow me?

1145
01:27:09,722 --> 01:27:11,098
Please sit.

1146
01:27:15,811 --> 01:27:17,188
What is this?

1147
01:27:17,188 --> 01:27:18,397
- What is this?
- He'll be with you shortly.

1148
01:27:18,481 --> 01:27:20,566
Huh? Where is the water?

1149
01:27:20,649 --> 01:27:22,693
Bring them water, quickly!

1150
01:28:03,066 --> 01:28:04,443
Commandant.

1151
01:28:07,154 --> 01:28:08,196
Commandant?

1152
01:28:10,115 --> 01:28:11,409
Commandant.

1153
01:28:13,952 --> 01:28:15,413
I trust you rested well.

1154
01:28:16,330 --> 01:28:19,375
I would like you to know we also
offered rations and water

1155
01:28:19,458 --> 01:28:22,420
to the rest of your battalion this morning.

1156
01:28:22,503 --> 01:28:24,171
Thank you, Deputy.

1157
01:28:31,470 --> 01:28:34,598
Please, gentlemen. Please come over.

1158
01:28:37,685 --> 01:28:39,102
Stand there.

1159
01:28:49,154 --> 01:28:50,155
Attention!

1160
01:29:07,005 --> 01:29:09,007
Commandant.

1161
01:29:09,091 --> 01:29:11,009
Supreme Commander, sir.

1162
01:29:14,012 --> 01:29:15,306
At ease, gentlemen.

1163
01:29:15,389 --> 01:29:17,224
At ease.

1164
01:29:27,025 --> 01:29:29,445
It looks like your family has grown.

1165
01:29:29,528 --> 01:29:33,366
They must eat while we talk,
unless you are hungry, too.

1166
01:29:33,449 --> 01:29:37,035
I'm not hungry. Two-I-C,
take them and go and eat.

1167
01:29:37,119 --> 01:29:39,830
Two-I-C, you stay.

1168
01:29:39,913 --> 01:29:41,039
Come.

1169
01:29:45,753 --> 01:29:49,047
Lot of food over here.
Let's eat, man!

1170
01:29:50,048 --> 01:29:51,634
I love food.

1171
01:29:58,766 --> 01:30:00,225
What is this?

1172
01:30:02,770 --> 01:30:04,813
You have made me wait.

1173
01:30:06,064 --> 01:30:09,902
You are leading me to believe
we are changing objectives.

1174
01:30:09,985 --> 01:30:12,863
Are we not taking the capital anymore?

1175
01:30:12,946 --> 01:30:17,075
Chief, to protect our people,
the time is now.

1176
01:30:17,159 --> 01:30:22,330
If we have the momentum and
we have the power, why wait?

1177
01:30:22,415 --> 01:30:27,795
You are not the political voice of this
movement, Commandant. I am.

1178
01:30:27,878 --> 01:30:32,215
Protecting our people remains the priority.

1179
01:30:32,299 --> 01:30:36,344
But as you know, the world is becoming
aware of this war now.

1180
01:30:37,262 --> 01:30:40,265
No one will escape judgment
when it is over.

1181
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:45,228
And the decisions we make have
far deeper consequences.

1182
01:30:45,312 --> 01:30:49,942
And what decisions have you made
for my battalion?

1183
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:55,072
Are you not making me general?

1184
01:30:55,155 --> 01:30:57,199
No, I am not.

1185
01:30:57,282 --> 01:31:00,744
I'm giving your battalion to Two-I-C,
Commandant.

1186
01:31:00,828 --> 01:31:02,162
That is why I brought you here.

1187
01:31:02,245 --> 01:31:07,167
And you, I will promote to
Deputy Chief of Security,

1188
01:31:07,250 --> 01:31:08,251
effective immediately.

1189
01:31:08,335 --> 01:31:12,089
I hope you accept and act accordingly.

1190
01:31:13,632 --> 01:31:15,926
Thank you, sir. I promise to fulfill
my duty to the fullest...

1191
01:31:16,009 --> 01:31:17,010
Two-I-C, shut your mouth!

1192
01:31:18,929 --> 01:31:20,473
Get out!

1193
01:31:23,934 --> 01:31:25,102
Soldiers.

1194
01:31:33,151 --> 01:31:35,904
You are demoting me.

1195
01:31:37,155 --> 01:31:41,785
This, my battalion...that I have made
with my own hands.

1196
01:31:41,869 --> 01:31:43,453
I'm their father!

1197
01:31:43,537 --> 01:31:46,790
Your battalion is my battalion, Commandant,

1198
01:31:46,874 --> 01:31:49,417
as are hundreds of others
across this nation.

1199
01:31:50,335 --> 01:31:52,755
I want the ceremony of changeover tomorrow,

1200
01:31:52,838 --> 01:31:55,799
so that Two-I-C can take the battalion
back out for battle.

1201
01:31:55,883 --> 01:31:59,970
As you know, and with thanks to you,
we have the NRC on their heels

1202
01:32:00,053 --> 01:32:03,181
with the help and support
of the UN and ECOMOD.

1203
01:32:03,265 --> 01:32:06,476
It has now become a battle
for public image.

1204
01:32:08,186 --> 01:32:10,606
And what of my payment? Hmm?

1205
01:32:10,689 --> 01:32:12,024
What of my payment?

1206
01:32:12,107 --> 01:32:16,945
What share of the resources
will I be seeing?

1207
01:32:17,487 --> 01:32:20,407
Do not forget you are a soldier.

1208
01:32:20,991 --> 01:32:23,536
Your most important duty is obedience.

1209
01:32:23,619 --> 01:32:25,078
Your first duty is obedience.

1210
01:32:25,162 --> 01:32:26,955
Your second duty is obedience.

1211
01:32:27,039 --> 01:32:29,750
Your third duty is obedience.
Everything is obedience.

1212
01:32:29,833 --> 01:32:33,962
Without obedience, you have nothing.

1213
01:32:36,089 --> 01:32:38,551
Have you forgotten yourself?

1214
01:32:41,094 --> 01:32:43,346
I have not forgotten myself.

1215
01:32:45,223 --> 01:32:47,434
You are right.

1216
01:32:47,517 --> 01:32:50,938
I'm a soldier...

1217
01:32:51,021 --> 01:32:53,566
not a politician.

1218
01:32:55,943 --> 01:33:00,656
I will have one more night with my men.

1219
01:33:04,743 --> 01:33:06,411
Dada Goodblood.

1220
01:33:09,331 --> 01:33:10,332
Move out!

1221
01:33:10,332 --> 01:33:11,249
- Move out!
- Move!

1222
01:33:11,333 --> 01:33:12,167
Move out!

1223
01:33:12,167 --> 01:33:13,376
- Move out!
- Move out!

1224
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:15,045
Let's go.

1225
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:23,095
Tripod.

1226
01:33:23,095 --> 01:33:24,012
- Tripod.
- Yes, sir.

1227
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:27,474
Assemble the COs and the troops
and bivouac outside of town.

1228
01:33:27,557 --> 01:33:30,769
I'm taking Two-I-C and the boys
to all celebrate tonight.

1229
01:33:30,853 --> 01:33:31,979
Yes, sir.

1230
01:33:32,062 --> 01:33:33,772
Where are we going?

1231
01:33:35,816 --> 01:33:37,860
You will see.

1232
01:33:37,943 --> 01:33:39,778
You will like it.

1233
01:33:39,862 --> 01:33:43,824
And if you and Strika are my bodyguards,
and I am going, then you are also going.

1234
01:33:43,907 --> 01:33:45,784
Are you hearing me?

1235
01:34:07,723 --> 01:34:10,350
Imagination TV.

1236
01:34:10,433 --> 01:34:12,144
Ha! So you come!

1237
01:34:12,227 --> 01:34:17,024
Ha! Commandant! Commandant!

1238
01:34:17,024 --> 01:34:17,983
- Ha! Commandant! Commandant!
- Ah, Mama.

1239
01:34:18,066 --> 01:34:20,068
Welcome, welcome.

1240
01:34:20,152 --> 01:34:22,487
Yeah, make 'em bring something
for my soldiers.

1241
01:34:22,570 --> 01:34:24,072
- Okay.
- And my own soldier.

1242
01:34:24,156 --> 01:34:25,157
Hey, hey...

1243
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:28,661
Bring beer. Bring soda. Bring
whatever you have.

1244
01:34:28,744 --> 01:34:30,788
Hey, hey! Get up!

1245
01:34:30,871 --> 01:34:33,123
Hurry, hurry!

1246
01:34:33,206 --> 01:34:36,919
Can't you see we have guests? Hurry!

1247
01:34:41,631 --> 01:34:43,383
The beer is warm.

1248
01:34:44,384 --> 01:34:45,886
How is the beer warm?

1249
01:34:45,969 --> 01:34:47,429
No ice.

1250
01:34:47,429 --> 01:34:48,430
- No ice.
- No ice?

1251
01:34:48,513 --> 01:34:50,974
No light.

1252
01:34:51,058 --> 01:34:52,810
But I am seeing light.

1253
01:34:52,893 --> 01:34:54,352
No ice.

1254
01:34:54,436 --> 01:34:57,690
Oh! Well, doesn't matter

1255
01:34:57,773 --> 01:35:00,233
because we will drink it whether
it's hot or it's cold.

1256
01:35:00,317 --> 01:35:02,527
Go on. Share it.

1257
01:35:02,610 --> 01:35:04,654
Commandant, permission to be dismissed.

1258
01:35:04,738 --> 01:35:06,406
I need to be checking on the others...

1259
01:35:06,489 --> 01:35:08,158
Negative!

1260
01:35:10,327 --> 01:35:13,621
You will be staying here so
we can celebrate you.

1261
01:35:13,706 --> 01:35:18,460
In fact, Mama, I want you to bring
a special one for my Two-I-C,

1262
01:35:18,543 --> 01:35:21,714
who will soon be the Commandant.

1263
01:35:21,797 --> 01:35:23,131
Who is your Commandant?

1264
01:35:23,131 --> 01:35:23,966
- Who is your Commandant?
- You, sir!

1265
01:35:24,049 --> 01:35:27,010
Hmm. But you have one special for Two-I-C.

1266
01:35:27,094 --> 01:35:29,262
No problem.

1267
01:35:29,346 --> 01:35:31,974
No problem.

1268
01:35:34,351 --> 01:35:36,061
No problem.

1269
01:35:36,144 --> 01:35:39,022
Hey, Mama, this one has fresh papaya.

1270
01:35:39,106 --> 01:35:40,648
No, no, no, no, Commandant.

1271
01:35:40,733 --> 01:35:42,275
Leave this one now.

1272
01:35:42,359 --> 01:35:46,196
If it is women you wanting,
I get plenty from backyard.

1273
01:35:46,279 --> 01:35:49,449
Just bring me my own. You
know my specifications.

1274
01:35:49,532 --> 01:35:50,700
I know! I know!

1275
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:52,702
Aunty, bring us some chips.

1276
01:35:52,786 --> 01:35:54,162
Ah.

1277
01:35:54,246 --> 01:35:56,790
See this little yeah-yeah boy
born yesterday.

1278
01:35:56,874 --> 01:35:59,918
Don't mind him. Don't mind him.

1279
01:36:00,002 --> 01:36:01,253
Where are the girls?

1280
01:36:01,253 --> 01:36:02,129
- Where are the girls?
- They are coming.

1281
01:36:04,172 --> 01:36:09,344
We've got enough girls for the men,
but no more for the little boys.

1282
01:36:11,847 --> 01:36:14,266
Leave your weapons with Strika.

1283
01:36:21,106 --> 01:36:22,858
Oh-ho!

1284
01:36:24,317 --> 01:36:26,694
You're the controller.

1285
01:36:28,530 --> 01:36:30,157
How are you? How are you?

1286
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:32,450
Look at you. Look at you.

1287
01:36:32,534 --> 01:36:34,702
Commandant. Commandant.

1288
01:36:34,787 --> 01:36:37,664
You are looking very hot.

1289
01:36:37,664 --> 01:36:38,791
- You are looking very hot.
- Yeah, I miss you.

1290
01:36:38,874 --> 01:36:39,833
Oh, you miss me. Really?

1291
01:36:39,833 --> 01:36:40,708
- Oh, you miss me. Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

1292
01:36:40,793 --> 01:36:42,961
Strika.

1293
01:36:43,045 --> 01:36:45,255
SBU, be watching guard.

1294
01:36:45,338 --> 01:36:49,843
Don't be watching your Commandant because
you can't have what I'm having.

1295
01:37:07,986 --> 01:37:09,071
We'll start shooting.

1296
01:37:09,696 --> 01:37:11,739
Go stand by the waterfall.

1297
01:38:08,755 --> 01:38:10,883
What happened? Huh?

1298
01:38:12,550 --> 01:38:13,551
What happened?

1299
01:38:15,678 --> 01:38:16,679
You did this.

1300
01:38:16,763 --> 01:38:19,182
What happened to my man?
What happened here?

1301
01:38:19,266 --> 01:38:21,268
I was just playing with his gun
and it just went off.

1302
01:38:21,351 --> 01:38:22,895
I don't know what happened. I'm sorry.

1303
01:38:22,895 --> 01:38:24,354
- I don't know what happened. I'm sorry.
- You did this.

1304
01:38:24,437 --> 01:38:27,190
- You did this.
- Relax, relax, relax, relax!

1305
01:38:27,274 --> 01:38:28,816
You did this! You did this!

1306
01:38:28,901 --> 01:38:30,777
I didn't mean to.

1307
01:38:30,860 --> 01:38:32,070
- You thought you were shooting me!
- No, no, no!

1308
01:38:32,154 --> 01:38:33,321
You thought it was me?

1309
01:38:33,321 --> 01:38:34,322
- You thought it was me?
- I didn't mean to. I'm so sorry.

1310
01:38:34,406 --> 01:38:35,991
Were you trying to kill me
and you kill my soldier?

1311
01:38:36,074 --> 01:38:39,036
It was an accident!
No! Not me...

1312
01:38:39,119 --> 01:38:40,245
Go!

1313
01:38:42,789 --> 01:38:44,832
- Let's go. Let's go! Hey!
- Move!

1314
01:38:44,917 --> 01:38:47,294
Pick him up! Pick him up! Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

1315
01:38:47,377 --> 01:38:49,212
Pick him up! I want you
to take all their women!

1316
01:38:49,296 --> 01:38:50,588
- Move! Move! Move! Move!
- All of them!

1317
01:38:50,672 --> 01:38:51,506
Move!

1318
01:38:51,506 --> 01:38:53,133
- Move!
- Let's go! Let's go! Move!

1319
01:38:57,429 --> 01:38:59,472
All call signs, all call signs,

1320
01:38:59,556 --> 01:39:01,308
anyone have eyes on Iron Jacket?

1321
01:39:01,391 --> 01:39:05,187
All call signs report visual
of Iron Jacket. Over.

1322
01:39:06,313 --> 01:39:09,607
Mountain View, Z Fire.
Did not copy. Over.

1323
01:39:11,401 --> 01:39:14,737
All call signs, report visual
on Iron Jacket.

1324
01:39:14,821 --> 01:39:18,533
Any knowledge on the location or
movement of Iron Jacket? Over.

1325
01:39:19,701 --> 01:39:20,994
Mountain View.

1326
01:39:21,078 --> 01:39:22,745
Green Snake. No visual.

1327
01:39:22,829 --> 01:39:25,582
I repeat, no visual of Iron Jacket. Over.

1328
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:30,837
Mountain View. Two-two. Copy same.
No visual on Iron Jacket.

1329
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:32,880
Nothing to report. Over.

1330
01:39:34,507 --> 01:39:35,925
Mountain View. Black Sand.

1331
01:39:36,009 --> 01:39:40,722
Report, Iron Jacket moved out from
our checkpoint yesterday. Over.

1332
01:39:42,099 --> 01:39:44,601
Black Sand. Mountain View.

1333
01:39:44,684 --> 01:39:46,811
Iron Jacket moved through your sector?
Over.

1334
01:39:49,272 --> 01:39:51,316
Mountain View, Black Sand, Roger.

1335
01:39:54,944 --> 01:39:58,781
Iron Jacket battalion moved out
with orders for battle. Over.

1336
01:39:58,865 --> 01:40:01,201
This...

1337
01:40:03,453 --> 01:40:06,623
This was all for nothing.

1338
01:40:17,509 --> 01:40:19,761
Iron Jacket, this is Mountain View.

1339
01:40:19,844 --> 01:40:21,263
Agu, is that you?

1340
01:40:21,346 --> 01:40:22,805
- Iron Jacket, where are you?
- Yes, sir.

1341
01:40:22,930 --> 01:40:24,766
- Do you read me? Over.
- Come.

1342
01:40:24,849 --> 01:40:28,061
- Come and sit with me.
- Iron Jacket, do you copy? Over.

1343
01:40:28,145 --> 01:40:30,563
Iron Jacket, you are disobeying a direct...

1344
01:40:40,573 --> 01:40:44,077
Agu, these are very dangerous times.

1345
01:40:44,994 --> 01:40:47,580
Never know who you could be trusting.

1346
01:40:47,664 --> 01:40:48,748
Huh?

1347
01:40:49,791 --> 01:40:54,171
That is why it is good to always sleep
one eye open.

1348
01:40:55,255 --> 01:40:58,050
That is why I have you and I have Strika.

1349
01:41:02,929 --> 01:41:05,723
Agu, sometimes I'm feeling sorry for you.

1350
01:41:08,143 --> 01:41:09,686
Sometimes I am.

1351
01:41:13,731 --> 01:41:16,151
Two-I-C is dead.

1352
01:41:16,234 --> 01:41:19,737
God, bless the man who died.

1353
01:41:19,821 --> 01:41:23,533
On the great battlefront.

1354
01:41:23,616 --> 01:41:27,454
For the sake of the NDF.

1355
01:41:27,537 --> 01:41:31,666
God, bless the man who died.

1356
01:41:31,749 --> 01:41:35,712
Our Father, today we lost
our fellow soldier.

1357
01:41:35,795 --> 01:41:39,091
Guide him forever and ever. Amen.

1358
01:41:39,174 --> 01:41:40,592
Amen.

1359
01:41:41,759 --> 01:41:43,178
Two-I-C.

1360
01:41:45,263 --> 01:41:46,098
Yes, sir!

1361
01:41:46,098 --> 01:41:47,682
Yes, sir!

1362
01:41:49,517 --> 01:41:52,562
This was not God's work.

1363
01:41:52,645 --> 01:41:54,272
This was man.

1364
01:41:54,856 --> 01:41:57,484
Supreme Commandant was our friend.

1365
01:41:57,984 --> 01:42:00,445
Now he's our enemy.

1366
01:42:00,528 --> 01:42:05,367
But we are not fearing change,
for we are strong!

1367
01:42:05,450 --> 01:42:08,120
Strong and proud!

1368
01:42:08,661 --> 01:42:13,416
That is why we should be taking
our own territory...

1369
01:42:15,001 --> 01:42:17,587
and filling our own pockets.

1370
01:42:19,422 --> 01:42:23,176
Gentlemen, move out.

1371
01:42:23,885 --> 01:42:25,595
Let's move.

1372
01:42:30,433 --> 01:42:35,397
We are leaving Two-I-C to be eaten
by gogomi and worms.

1373
01:42:35,480 --> 01:42:38,441
We are leaving him.

1374
01:42:38,525 --> 01:42:40,943
And I am thinking,

1375
01:42:41,027 --> 01:42:44,156
<i>The only way not to be fighting anymore
is to be dying.</i>

1376
01:43:38,335 --> 01:43:40,587
Medic! Where's the fucking medic?

1377
01:43:40,670 --> 01:43:42,714
He's fucking dead, my man!

1378
01:43:48,761 --> 01:43:52,724
People are dying just like this every day.

1379
01:43:52,807 --> 01:43:56,185
Every person I am knowing is dying.

1380
01:43:56,269 --> 01:43:58,104
And I am thinking,

1381
01:43:58,187 --> 01:44:04,110
<i>If this war is ever ending, I cannot
be going back to doing child things.</i>

1382
01:44:12,952 --> 01:44:16,038
Bullet is just eating everything.

1383
01:44:18,291 --> 01:44:22,337
Leaves, trees, ground, person.

1384
01:44:24,046 --> 01:44:25,047
Eating them.

1385
01:44:25,882 --> 01:44:28,843
Just making person to bleed everywhere.

1386
01:44:34,266 --> 01:44:39,646
We are just like wild animals now
with no place to be going.

1387
01:44:45,192 --> 01:44:47,445
Sun,

1388
01:44:47,529 --> 01:44:49,864
why are you shining on this world?

1389
01:44:51,616 --> 01:44:55,077
I am wanting to catch you in my hands,

1390
01:44:55,161 --> 01:44:59,541
to squeeze you until you
cannot shine no more.

1391
01:45:01,626 --> 01:45:04,587
That way, everything is always dark

1392
01:45:04,671 --> 01:45:06,839
and nobody's ever having to see

1393
01:45:06,923 --> 01:45:10,051
all the terrible things that
are happening here.

1394
01:45:53,928 --> 01:45:55,888
Preacher!

1395
01:45:59,851 --> 01:46:00,935
Sir.

1396
01:46:09,318 --> 01:46:10,820
Thank you, sir.

1397
01:46:34,135 --> 01:46:35,970
Strika.

1398
01:46:36,554 --> 01:46:38,640
Strika! Strika! Strika!

1399
01:46:39,348 --> 01:46:42,018
Stand up and let's go! We are going.

1400
01:46:43,770 --> 01:46:45,480
Let's go!

1401
01:46:46,981 --> 01:46:48,483
Strika!

1402
01:46:49,859 --> 01:46:51,569
Stand up and let's go!

1403
01:46:54,238 --> 01:46:56,157
What is wrong with you?

1404
01:47:00,161 --> 01:47:01,663
What is wrong?

1405
01:48:02,932 --> 01:48:07,770
I am wanting to say to Strika,
<i>I am tired, too.</i>

1406
01:48:10,022 --> 01:48:12,066
I am tired,

1407
01:48:12,149 --> 01:48:15,487
and so the words are not
coming out of my mouth.

1408
01:48:47,059 --> 01:48:48,269
Strika?

1409
01:48:50,605 --> 01:48:52,231
Do you hear that?

1410
01:48:53,816 --> 01:48:56,152
A song, just like my mother sang.

1411
01:48:59,531 --> 01:49:00,740
Strika?

1412
01:49:02,700 --> 01:49:03,910
Strika?

1413
01:49:06,203 --> 01:49:07,413
Strika.

1414
01:49:16,088 --> 01:49:18,550
Strika! Strika!

1415
01:49:20,342 --> 01:49:21,553
Strika!

1416
01:49:24,513 --> 01:49:25,723
Strika!

1417
01:49:36,525 --> 01:49:38,110
Someone help us.

1418
01:49:42,198 --> 01:49:43,658
Strika!

1419
01:49:44,742 --> 01:49:45,952
Strika!

1420
01:49:49,163 --> 01:49:50,582
Strika!

1421
01:49:52,667 --> 01:49:53,876
Strika!

1422
01:51:02,028 --> 01:51:05,657
Fuck you. Life is sad.

1423
01:51:24,258 --> 01:51:27,762
Agu. Agu. Agu!

1424
01:51:27,845 --> 01:51:28,971
Sir?

1425
01:51:29,055 --> 01:51:31,974
Go get me some fucking bullets
to be shooting right now. Move!

1426
01:51:33,350 --> 01:51:34,476
Move!

1427
01:51:58,876 --> 01:52:00,586
Do you have bullet?

1428
01:52:14,851 --> 01:52:16,060
Mother.

1429
01:52:20,272 --> 01:52:25,111
I can only be talking to you now
because God is not listening.

1430
01:52:29,907 --> 01:52:32,952
Your song is making my body to move,

1431
01:52:33,035 --> 01:52:36,205
and I am not having to think anymore.

1432
01:52:42,128 --> 01:52:46,883
Not about Strika, not about this war,

1433
01:52:46,966 --> 01:52:50,803
not about any of the things that
are jumping into my head.

1434
01:52:55,933 --> 01:52:59,812
I am wanting to lie down
on the warm ground

1435
01:52:59,896 --> 01:53:04,566
with my eyes closed and the smell
of mud in my nose.

1436
01:54:03,918 --> 01:54:05,502
Commandant, sir.

1437
01:54:06,795 --> 01:54:08,714
We are out from bullet.

1438
01:54:13,928 --> 01:54:17,264
It wasn't supposed to be the way
that it has turned out to be.

1439
01:54:18,515 --> 01:54:21,643
Everybody betrays you eventually.

1440
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:27,316
But you, I will always protect you, Agu,
because you are my son...

1441
01:54:29,318 --> 01:54:32,154
and a son always protects a father.

1442
01:54:36,658 --> 01:54:39,954
Commandant, I want to talk to you, sir.

1443
01:54:40,037 --> 01:54:41,956
What is all this?

1444
01:54:42,039 --> 01:54:43,415
We are leaving, sir.

1445
01:54:43,499 --> 01:54:45,042
Who is leaving?

1446
01:54:46,752 --> 01:54:49,713
Who and who is leaving?

1447
01:54:51,423 --> 01:54:54,176
Two-I-C, go back to your post.

1448
01:54:55,386 --> 01:54:59,098
No, sir. We are going, sir.

1449
01:54:59,181 --> 01:55:01,350
You are the only one standing
in front of me, stupid.

1450
01:55:02,184 --> 01:55:07,773
I am going, sir. No bullets. What am
I going to use to shoot my enemy?

1451
01:55:08,440 --> 01:55:10,276
We have been here for months now.

1452
01:55:10,359 --> 01:55:12,528
Gold miners, no gold.

1453
01:55:12,611 --> 01:55:16,198
No money, no food, no water.

1454
01:55:16,282 --> 01:55:17,909
It madness, Commandant.

1455
01:55:18,659 --> 01:55:20,995
People sick here and dying every day.

1456
01:55:22,413 --> 01:55:25,207
It madness, Commander.

1457
01:55:25,291 --> 01:55:27,001
Who want to stay here and die?

1458
01:55:27,084 --> 01:55:28,169
I want to go!

1459
01:55:28,169 --> 01:55:29,586
- I want to go!
- I want to going!

1460
01:55:29,670 --> 01:55:31,505
Who want to stay here and die?

1461
01:55:31,588 --> 01:55:33,007
I want to go, sir!

1462
01:55:33,090 --> 01:55:34,716
Me, too. I want to go, sir!

1463
01:55:35,509 --> 01:55:37,344
Who want to stay here and die?

1464
01:55:37,428 --> 01:55:38,470
Nobody want to stay here, sir!

1465
01:55:38,470 --> 01:55:40,306
- Nobody want to stay here, sir!
- We want to go, sir.

1466
01:55:40,932 --> 01:55:42,474
Then come and tell him how you feel.

1467
01:55:43,976 --> 01:55:48,189
Come and tell him how much
we are suffering here.

1468
01:55:49,815 --> 01:55:53,235
Come! Everybody, come.

1469
01:55:53,319 --> 01:55:56,030
So, you...you are the big man now, huh?

1470
01:55:57,198 --> 01:55:58,407
Hmm?

1471
01:55:58,490 --> 01:56:00,659
Where will you be going? Huh?

1472
01:56:00,742 --> 01:56:03,745
Will you surrender to the other NDF camp?

1473
01:56:03,829 --> 01:56:06,498
No. They will eat you.

1474
01:56:08,042 --> 01:56:10,836
And what of ECOMOD? Huh?

1475
01:56:10,920 --> 01:56:13,630
That might be better, but what next?

1476
01:56:13,714 --> 01:56:15,632
Jail?

1477
01:56:15,716 --> 01:56:17,634
War crimes?

1478
01:56:17,718 --> 01:56:18,802
Huh?

1479
01:56:20,637 --> 01:56:25,935
You think you can just go and
do what you want in peace?

1480
01:56:26,018 --> 01:56:28,562
You will go back to your village

1481
01:56:28,645 --> 01:56:32,942
and your family will not associate
themselves with you.

1482
01:56:33,025 --> 01:56:34,860
Huh? You will be nothing.

1483
01:56:34,944 --> 01:56:39,198
You and your uneducated, poor mind,
you'll be nothing.

1484
01:56:39,281 --> 01:56:42,784
Nobody will care for you. Huh?

1485
01:56:42,868 --> 01:56:45,204
Look at you.

1486
01:56:45,287 --> 01:56:51,793
And you will wake up and you will rise and
see the sunrise and see the sunset,

1487
01:56:51,877 --> 01:56:55,339
and you can just wait all day, all day,

1488
01:56:55,422 --> 01:57:00,052
with thousands of men just like you, waiting
for somebody to give you a job.

1489
01:57:00,136 --> 01:57:01,178
Huh?

1490
01:57:02,179 --> 01:57:04,473
That is what you want to go and do?

1491
01:57:04,556 --> 01:57:07,601
You are stupid!

1492
01:57:08,102 --> 01:57:11,105
You have nothing! No future!

1493
01:57:11,188 --> 01:57:12,356
I am your future.

1494
01:57:12,898 --> 01:57:15,026
You fucking die here, sir.

1495
01:57:15,109 --> 01:57:16,443
What?

1496
01:57:21,657 --> 01:57:24,826
How are you going to shoot me
if you don't have bullets?

1497
01:57:27,204 --> 01:57:29,873
And you, Agu?

1498
01:57:29,956 --> 01:57:31,875
You wanna kill Commandant?

1499
01:57:32,584 --> 01:57:35,671
Hey, Agu, I want you to kill Commandant.
Come.

1500
01:57:35,754 --> 01:57:36,588
Push it.

1501
01:57:36,588 --> 01:57:37,464
- Push it.
- Do it.

1502
01:57:37,548 --> 01:57:40,384
Come, Agu, come. Put it here. Here!

1503
01:57:40,467 --> 01:57:41,677
A-ha! A-ha!

1504
01:57:42,594 --> 01:57:43,887
Wanna kill Commandant?

1505
01:57:43,970 --> 01:57:45,889
Do it, Agu.

1506
01:57:46,432 --> 01:57:47,891
Do it.

1507
01:57:47,974 --> 01:57:50,561
Kill Commandant!

1508
01:57:50,644 --> 01:57:52,438
You wanna surrender?

1509
01:57:52,521 --> 01:57:53,689
Huh?

1510
01:57:53,772 --> 01:57:55,732
You wanna surrender?

1511
01:57:58,985 --> 01:58:00,571
You wanna surrender?

1512
01:58:02,531 --> 01:58:03,615
Yes.

1513
01:58:10,414 --> 01:58:11,707
Hey, Agu.

1514
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:16,420
Just get out.

1515
01:58:19,215 --> 01:58:24,095
Just remember, when you are all
poor and hungry

1516
01:58:25,679 --> 01:58:27,639
you'll remember me!

1517
01:58:28,599 --> 01:58:31,518
You'll remember your Commandant.

1518
01:58:32,018 --> 01:58:34,438
Just go! Just go!

1519
01:58:34,521 --> 01:58:36,315
Come on. Everybody, let's move!

1520
01:58:36,398 --> 01:58:38,150
- Yes, sir!
- Come on, let's go.

1521
01:58:38,234 --> 01:58:42,488
And know that I will be
calling for you one day.

1522
01:58:44,740 --> 01:58:48,410
Go and drink gunpowder tea
and playing draughts.

1523
01:58:48,494 --> 01:58:52,581
No, no, no. You remember me. You
remember your Commandant.

1524
01:58:52,664 --> 01:58:54,666
You're gonna say, <i>Yeah!</i>

1525
01:58:58,295 --> 01:59:01,340
Remember, I will call for you again...

1526
01:59:01,423 --> 01:59:04,343
and you'll come.

1527
01:59:06,428 --> 01:59:07,721
Remember.

1528
01:59:17,648 --> 01:59:22,027
They will just lock you up in jail!
You are stupid!

1529
01:59:22,944 --> 01:59:25,364
When the time come back,

1530
01:59:25,447 --> 01:59:27,783
the other ones, they'll come eat you.

1531
01:59:27,866 --> 01:59:31,245
Just chop for you...your heart.

1532
01:59:31,328 --> 01:59:33,997
Agu, you stay here because they don't...

1533
02:00:17,208 --> 02:00:18,792
Halt! Stop there!

1534
02:00:18,875 --> 02:00:20,085
Who are you?

1535
02:00:20,085 --> 02:00:21,086
- Who are you?
- NDF, sir!

1536
02:00:21,170 --> 02:00:22,171
And what is your mission here?

1537
02:00:22,254 --> 02:00:23,255
Surrender, sir!

1538
02:00:23,339 --> 02:00:26,258
Raise up your arms! All weapons in the air!

1539
02:00:26,342 --> 02:00:27,343
All of you!

1540
02:00:28,594 --> 02:00:30,971
Now turn and face the bush!

1541
02:00:31,054 --> 02:00:34,475
Don't look at my face! Put your weapons
on the ground!

1542
02:00:34,558 --> 02:00:37,811
Step back. Step back!

1543
02:00:37,894 --> 02:00:39,938
And turn around!

1544
02:00:40,021 --> 02:00:41,690
I said, turn around!

1545
02:00:41,773 --> 02:00:43,108
Alright, hands up!

1546
02:00:43,192 --> 02:00:45,694
Hands up! Sit on the floor!

1547
02:00:50,866 --> 02:00:52,701
Sit down!

1548
02:00:53,702 --> 02:00:55,829
Put your hands on your head!

1549
02:01:00,626 --> 02:01:02,461
Don't look at my face!

1550
02:03:49,210 --> 02:03:51,547
Agu, how are you settling in?

1551
02:03:52,464 --> 02:03:53,590
Hmm?

1552
02:03:55,717 --> 02:03:58,554
I know things are hard.

1553
02:03:59,179 --> 02:04:01,222
I've been there, remember?

1554
02:04:02,891 --> 02:04:05,602
We are all here to help you.

1555
02:04:06,520 --> 02:04:08,397
Okay?

1556
02:04:08,480 --> 02:04:11,525
I am not knowing how long
I am staying here...

1557
02:04:12,734 --> 02:04:15,987
but I'm staying here for a long time.

1558
02:04:17,781 --> 02:04:23,119
Some week, some month, I am not knowing.

1559
02:04:25,371 --> 02:04:28,667
All I am knowing is how it is feeling here.

1560
02:04:31,211 --> 02:04:36,467
I am knowing the sound of people screaming
and the smell of dead bodies...

1561
02:04:37,926 --> 02:04:43,181
and I am knowing the feeling of
the brown-brown and djamba in
my blood.

1562
02:04:51,523 --> 02:04:53,316
Hey, calm down!

1563
02:04:53,399 --> 02:04:54,693
This is your home!

1564
02:04:54,776 --> 02:04:57,195
No, they are giving us poison there!

1565
02:04:57,278 --> 02:04:58,947
- They want us to die!
- Yes!

1566
02:04:59,030 --> 02:05:00,532
- They want us to die!
- Calm!

1567
02:05:00,616 --> 02:05:03,243
Preacher is tiring of this place.

1568
02:05:03,326 --> 02:05:05,370
He's saying, <i>The war is not over,</i>

1569
02:05:05,454 --> 02:05:08,164
<i>and they are needing fighters like us.</i>

1570
02:05:08,248 --> 02:05:11,376
We need money for here.
We need money. Eh?

1571
02:05:11,460 --> 02:05:13,504
You can't stay here without money.

1572
02:05:14,295 --> 02:05:16,715
And we're soldiers,

1573
02:05:16,798 --> 02:05:19,092
fighting is what we know.

1574
02:05:19,175 --> 02:05:21,219
That's what we should do.

1575
02:05:21,302 --> 02:05:24,014
Have you forgotten? We have food to eat.

1576
02:05:24,097 --> 02:05:25,724
- We have shelter.
- Shh!

1577
02:05:28,852 --> 02:05:31,730
And even we learn, we learn.

1578
02:05:31,730 --> 02:05:32,606
- And even we learn, we learn.
- Yeah.

1579
02:05:32,689 --> 02:05:33,982
You for shut up!

1580
02:05:34,065 --> 02:05:37,235
You NRC soldier, with the talk,
you talk too much.

1581
02:05:38,820 --> 02:05:41,782
Agu, I can't stay here. I'm leaving.

1582
02:05:41,865 --> 02:05:43,617
Preacher!

1583
02:05:43,617 --> 02:05:44,493
- Preacher!
- Let's go!

1584
02:05:45,410 --> 02:05:48,539
Randy, don't go into the bush again.

1585
02:05:50,749 --> 02:05:52,208
Don't follow Preacher.

1586
02:05:52,292 --> 02:05:54,628
Randy!

1587
02:06:08,433 --> 02:06:11,352
I don't like when you look into my eyes.

1588
02:06:11,436 --> 02:06:15,356
So if I look at a table,
how can I talk to you?

1589
02:06:15,440 --> 02:06:16,942
Amy.

1590
02:06:17,025 --> 02:06:19,069
She thinks that my no speaking

1591
02:06:19,152 --> 02:06:22,864
is because I can't be explaining myself
like baby,

1592
02:06:22,948 --> 02:06:24,950
but I am not like baby.

1593
02:06:25,033 --> 02:06:29,162
I am like old man and she's like small girl

1594
02:06:29,245 --> 02:06:34,417
because I am fighting in war and she's
not even knowing what war is.

1595
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:36,670
Try.

1596
02:06:36,753 --> 02:06:40,757
Try to talk to me about some
of your experiences...

1597
02:06:41,967 --> 02:06:45,887
or try to tell me what you are thinking.

1598
02:06:48,682 --> 02:06:50,892
I'm thinking about my future.

1599
02:06:52,227 --> 02:06:53,311
Very good.

1600
02:06:53,394 --> 02:06:55,564
Very good.

1601
02:06:55,647 --> 02:06:58,609
So how do you see your future?

1602
02:07:07,033 --> 02:07:08,952
Do me this favor, okay?

1603
02:07:14,207 --> 02:07:19,087
I think if you talk to me about it,
it will make you feel better.

1604
02:07:27,804 --> 02:07:29,806
I saw terrible things...

1605
02:07:32,308 --> 02:07:35,145
and I did terrible things.

1606
02:07:35,228 --> 02:07:38,231
So if I'm talking to you,

1607
02:07:38,314 --> 02:07:43,654
it will make me sad...and it
will make you, too, sad.

1608
02:07:43,737 --> 02:07:45,321
In this life...

1609
02:07:47,198 --> 02:07:50,326
I just want to be happy in this life.

1610
02:07:53,038 --> 02:07:55,540
If I'm telling this to you...

1611
02:07:59,419 --> 02:08:01,755
you will think that...

1612
02:08:06,968 --> 02:08:09,470
I am some sort of beast...

1613
02:08:11,848 --> 02:08:13,767
or devil.

1614
02:08:17,771 --> 02:08:20,106
I am all of these things...

1615
02:08:22,567 --> 02:08:24,986
but I also having mother...

1616
02:08:28,990 --> 02:08:30,366
father...

1617
02:08:33,369 --> 02:08:35,706
brother and sister once.

1618
02:08:37,791 --> 02:08:40,001
They loved me.
