1
00:01:22,658 --> 00:01:26,446
THE SKIN I LIVE IN

2
00:02:33,178 --> 00:02:35,373
Help me with the dumbwaiter.

3
00:02:39,098 --> 00:02:40,690
Open it.

4
00:02:41,778 --> 00:02:42,972
Take this.

5
00:03:06,898 --> 00:03:08,570
Marilia, are you there?

6
00:03:12,298 --> 00:03:13,367
Yes.

7
00:03:13,538 --> 00:03:16,291
Send up more sackcloth
and double-sided tape.

8
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:19,453
I can't get it until tomorrow.

9
00:03:20,058 --> 00:03:21,571
OK.

10
00:03:23,218 --> 00:03:27,769
I also wanted a needle,
thread and scissors.

11
00:03:27,938 --> 00:03:30,133
You're joking, right?

12
00:03:31,018 --> 00:03:32,656
Yeah.

13
00:04:09,298 --> 00:04:11,528
Our face identifies us.

14
00:04:11,658 --> 00:04:14,889
For burn victims,
saving their lives is not enough. 

15
00:04:14,978 --> 00:04:20,257
They need to have a face
even if it's from a corpse.

16
00:04:20,618 --> 00:04:21,573
A face with features...

17
00:04:21,658 --> 00:04:24,297
so they can gesticulate.

18
00:04:24,338 --> 00:04:25,851
I have participated in

19
00:04:26,018 --> 00:04:28,327
three out of the nine
face transplants

20
00:04:28,418 --> 00:04:31,808
 carried out in the world...

21
00:04:31,898 --> 00:04:35,208
and they were the most moving
experiences of my life.

22
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:38,527
Good...

23
00:04:38,618 --> 00:04:41,086
For a shapeless mass to acquire
the features that will give it expression...

24
00:04:41,138 --> 00:04:44,653
we have to mold the muscles...

25
00:04:44,738 --> 00:04:50,608
articulating the facial musculature
with the corresponding nerve endings.

26
00:04:50,738 --> 00:04:52,376
MATERNITY HOSPITAL

27
00:08:28,538 --> 00:08:32,053
Vera, I've brought you some opium.

28
00:08:42,138 --> 00:08:43,571
OPERATING THEATER

29
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:06,693
Can you breathe more gently?

30
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,647
If you want me
to stop breathing, kill me.

31
00:09:09,738 --> 00:09:11,330
Don't talk rubbish.

32
00:09:14,218 --> 00:09:16,413
How long will all this last?

33
00:09:16,618 --> 00:09:19,178
Your skin is softer than I thought.

34
00:09:19,298 --> 00:09:21,573
If you don't end it, I will.

35
00:09:21,658 --> 00:09:23,853
If you'd wanted to kill yourself...

36
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,008
you'd have tried to cut your jugular.

37
00:09:26,538 --> 00:09:28,096
In any case...

38
00:09:29,738 --> 00:09:32,332
I didn't know your skin was so soft.

39
00:09:40,378 --> 00:09:41,891
Here it is...

40
00:09:42,418 --> 00:09:44,613
taken from the animal
while it was still alive.

41
00:09:45,698 --> 00:09:47,177
Thank you.

42
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:53,177
Now there won't be any more burns.

43
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:57,213
You said that a year ago.

44
00:12:58,098 --> 00:12:59,895
I was hasty.

45
00:13:06,698 --> 00:13:08,654
Tell me if it burns you.

46
00:13:09,018 --> 00:13:10,417
No.

47
00:13:12,698 --> 00:13:14,450
And now?

48
00:13:14,858 --> 00:13:16,610
No.

49
00:13:18,538 --> 00:13:20,176
Now!

50
00:13:20,298 --> 00:13:21,777
I have given the name "Gal"...

51
00:13:21,898 --> 00:13:24,093
to the artificial skin
I've been working on...

52
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,167
in recent years.

53
00:13:25,258 --> 00:13:27,852
Tell me if the mosquito bites you.

54
00:13:27,978 --> 00:13:31,095
This skin is resistant
to every insect bite...

55
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:32,452
No.

56
00:13:32,618 --> 00:13:34,574
...which means a natural barrier to

57
00:13:34,698 --> 00:13:37,895
...malaria, for example.

58
00:13:38,178 --> 00:13:41,887
Naturally, I've carried out
a rigorous quality control... 

59
00:13:42,218 --> 00:13:44,732
on the tissues implanted in mammals...

60
00:13:44,818 --> 00:13:45,773
specifically, in athymic mice...

61
00:13:45,898 --> 00:13:47,775
and the results...

62
00:13:47,898 --> 00:13:52,449
...have been spectacular.

63
00:13:52,538 --> 00:13:54,290
This leads me to suppose

64
00:13:54,338 --> 00:13:56,294
they would be equally positive...

65
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:58,096
in human mammals.

66
00:13:59,898 --> 00:14:03,447
What does the name Gal mean?
Are they initials?

67
00:14:03,578 --> 00:14:05,091
That was my wife's name.

68
00:14:05,218 --> 00:14:07,334
She was burned to death in a car crash.

69
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:10,137
In you presentation you stated...

70
00:14:10,698 --> 00:14:15,010
that the skin is resistant to insect bites
and could prevent malaria.

71
00:14:15,138 --> 00:14:16,776
What makes you think that?

72
00:14:17,138 --> 00:14:20,255
The artificial skin is much harder
than human skin...

73
00:14:20,378 --> 00:14:21,936
and it smells different.

74
00:14:22,058 --> 00:14:23,616
It's been proven that the malaria mosquito...

75
00:14:23,698 --> 00:14:26,166
distinguishes human skin by the smell.

76
00:14:26,338 --> 00:14:28,727
Gal smells different and repels it.

77
00:14:28,858 --> 00:14:30,735
Let's see if we can get rid of him.

78
00:14:30,898 --> 00:14:32,377
That isn't enough.

79
00:14:33,978 --> 00:14:36,412
How did you toughen the skin?

80
00:14:36,898 --> 00:14:38,411
Excuse me.

81
00:14:40,578 --> 00:14:42,534
Let's go somewhere quieter.

82
00:14:42,618 --> 00:14:44,973
There's only one way to toughen skin.

83
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:46,776
By mutating it.

84
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,971
Yes, that's what I did.

85
00:14:49,058 --> 00:14:50,650
Transgenesis.

86
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:54,973
Yes.
I transferred genetic information...

87
00:14:55,698 --> 00:14:58,496
from a pig's cell to a human cell.

88
00:14:58,938 --> 00:15:00,212
A pig's cell?

89
00:15:00,298 --> 00:15:02,016
It's much stronger than ours.

90
00:15:02,098 --> 00:15:03,531
You're insane!

91
00:15:03,938 --> 00:15:06,850
You know the application
of transgenetic therapy...

92
00:15:06,978 --> 00:15:08,457
in humans is completely forbidden!

93
00:15:08,578 --> 00:15:09,613
Yes, I do.

94
00:15:09,698 --> 00:15:13,247
And, forgive me,
but it seems the ultimate paradox.

95
00:15:13,858 --> 00:15:16,292
We intervene in everything around us...

96
00:15:16,418 --> 00:15:19,535
meat, clothes,
vegetables, fruit, everything!

97
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:23,247
Why not use scientific advances
to improve our species?

98
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:24,651
You know how many diseases...

99
00:15:24,738 --> 00:15:26,649
we could cure with transgenesis?

100
00:15:26,738 --> 00:15:29,013
Or the genetic malformations
that could be avoided?

101
00:15:29,058 --> 00:15:30,457
Don't go on!

102
00:15:30,538 --> 00:15:32,574
I know the list by heart...

103
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:35,412
and I think of it every day.

104
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:37,607
But even so...

105
00:15:37,698 --> 00:15:40,929
I must forbid you from 
investigating further...

106
00:15:41,058 --> 00:15:42,969
or I'll be forced to report you...

107
00:15:43,018 --> 00:15:44,576
to the scientific community.

108
00:15:44,658 --> 00:15:46,535
Over and above what you or I may think...

109
00:15:46,618 --> 00:15:50,452
the bioethics are
absolutely clear about this.

110
00:15:50,538 --> 00:15:55,612
Don't worry.
Gal was a personal adventure.

111
00:15:55,898 --> 00:15:58,093
I did it in memory of my wife...

112
00:15:58,178 --> 00:16:00,772
and solely to extend my knowledge.

113
00:16:00,858 --> 00:16:01,768
I remember...

114
00:16:01,858 --> 00:16:04,656
the first time
you told me about this experiment.

115
00:16:04,778 --> 00:16:06,928
It seemed like a dream then.

116
00:16:07,338 --> 00:16:08,771
And it still is.

117
00:16:08,898 --> 00:16:12,129
The president has ordered me
to give it up, indefinitely.

118
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,414
Shit, and it'll be the business
of the century.

119
00:16:14,498 --> 00:16:18,207
It will be,
but we won't benefit from it.

120
00:16:20,388 --> 00:16:22,856
If you give up research,
will you go back to surgery?

121
00:16:22,978 --> 00:16:25,617
Your patients will be delighted.

122
00:16:26,138 --> 00:16:28,208
I don't know.

123
00:16:28,338 --> 00:16:31,250
We've got a waiting list
for operations in "El Cigarral".

124
00:16:31,378 --> 00:16:34,017
- I'm leaving.
- Wait, so am I.

125
00:18:23,658 --> 00:18:25,967
Do you like what you see?

126
00:18:27,338 --> 00:18:29,374
What do you mean?

127
00:18:31,378 --> 00:18:33,892
Is there anything you want to improve?

128
00:18:35,138 --> 00:18:36,617
No.

129
00:18:36,938 --> 00:18:39,452
I don't want to improve anything.

130
00:18:40,618 --> 00:18:43,337
Can I take it I'm finished?

131
00:18:44,338 --> 00:18:45,930
Yes...

132
00:18:46,298 --> 00:18:49,495
and you can boast of having
the best skin in the world.

133
00:18:55,498 --> 00:18:57,489
And now what?

134
00:18:58,018 --> 00:19:00,578
Now I'm going to light
this opium pipe...

135
00:19:00,658 --> 00:19:02,455
and smoke it.

136
00:19:02,858 --> 00:19:04,655
I mean us.

137
00:19:05,498 --> 00:19:07,011
Me.

138
00:19:07,098 --> 00:19:10,090
What are you going to do with me?

139
00:19:11,258 --> 00:19:13,249
I don't know.
I'll think about it.

140
00:19:13,338 --> 00:19:14,407
When?

141
00:19:14,498 --> 00:19:16,932
If you keep on, I'm leaving!

142
00:19:17,538 --> 00:19:20,416
Couldn't we just live?

143
00:19:21,938 --> 00:19:23,894
Live together.

144
00:19:24,218 --> 00:19:26,174
Live together?

145
00:19:26,618 --> 00:19:29,416
- How?
- Like everyone.

146
00:19:30,938 --> 00:19:33,498
You and I aren't like everyone.

147
00:19:35,298 --> 00:19:37,573
Look on it as another
of your experiments.

148
00:19:37,618 --> 00:19:38,971
Living together as equals.

149
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:41,777
That's it!

150
00:19:49,178 --> 00:19:50,577
Here.

151
00:19:51,218 --> 00:19:53,573
I could set fire
to the house with this.

152
00:19:59,578 --> 00:20:01,216
I'm yours.

153
00:20:02,258 --> 00:20:04,408
I'm made to measure for you.

154
00:20:05,018 --> 00:20:07,691
And you've just told me
that you like me.

155
00:20:08,098 --> 00:20:09,850
Did I say that?

156
00:20:12,218 --> 00:20:14,493
I know you look at me.

157
00:20:16,058 --> 00:20:17,730
Since you brought me here,

158
00:20:17,778 --> 00:20:20,417
we practically live in the same room.

159
00:20:26,418 --> 00:20:27,931
In this pocket.

160
00:21:02,778 --> 00:21:09,611
<i>Carnival celebrations
are being held on the Gran Via.

161
00:21:16,018 --> 00:21:18,452
You shouldn't have used her face.

162
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,895
If I'd been here, 
I'd have warned you of the danger.

163
00:21:22,218 --> 00:21:24,413
There's a resemblance,
but she isn't the same.

164
00:21:24,498 --> 00:21:26,489
The resemblance is too strong.

165
00:21:27,058 --> 00:21:29,253
Have you thought
what to do with her?

166
00:21:29,378 --> 00:21:30,606
No.

167
00:21:30,738 --> 00:21:34,731
You'll have to kill her
or keep her hidden here forever.

168
00:21:35,978 --> 00:21:38,651
Why all the hurry to get rid of her?

169
00:21:38,938 --> 00:21:41,850
If you don't kill her,
she'll kill herself.

170
00:21:42,178 --> 00:21:44,248
Stories repeat themselves.

171
00:21:45,498 --> 00:21:47,136
No! Not this one!

172
00:21:47,658 --> 00:21:51,048
Vera is stronger, a born survivor.

173
00:21:51,378 --> 00:21:53,289
You're sick.

174
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:54,897
If you don't get rid of her...

175
00:21:54,978 --> 00:21:58,015
what you feel now will end up
devouring you, like a cancer.

176
00:21:58,738 --> 00:22:01,332
When you realize, it'll be too late.

177
00:22:02,778 --> 00:22:06,293
How are you so sure of what I feel
if even I don't know?

178
00:22:07,658 --> 00:22:10,456
Because I know you as if I'd borne you.

179
00:22:10,658 --> 00:22:13,218
Fire the servants
and don't hire anyone.

180
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:50,176
What do you want?

181
00:22:50,538 --> 00:22:54,087
<i>To see my mother.
I haven't seen her for ten years.

182
00:22:54,298 --> 00:22:55,367
If she was a servant...

183
00:22:55,418 --> 00:22:57,693
they've just left and won't be back.

184
00:22:58,898 --> 00:23:01,492
<i>I saw them,
but she wasn't one of them.

185
00:23:01,658 --> 00:23:03,171
<i>My mother is prettier.

186
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:05,135
Go away or I'll call the police.

187
00:23:17,138 --> 00:23:18,890
Zeca!

188
00:23:21,298 --> 00:23:24,176
I'm your son, Zeca.

189
00:23:24,298 --> 00:23:25,970
How dare you come here!

190
00:23:26,098 --> 00:23:27,451
Open the door!

191
00:23:27,538 --> 00:23:33,056
It's Carnival. We're both far
from Bahia and I'm homesick.

192
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:37,690
Look! Like the costume I wore
when I was little. Remember?

193
00:23:40,738 --> 00:23:42,376
Little tiger!

194
00:23:42,578 --> 00:23:44,773
I just want to see you for a minute.

195
00:23:44,938 --> 00:23:47,577
Very well, but then you leave.

196
00:23:47,978 --> 00:23:49,491
Whatever you say.

197
00:23:49,618 --> 00:23:54,009
Follow the path and keep going
through the second gate.

198
00:24:18,098 --> 00:24:19,417
How did you find us?

199
00:24:19,498 --> 00:24:23,457
I've been in Spain a while.
I saw Robert in the paper.

200
00:24:23,618 --> 00:24:25,290
He was giving a...

201
00:24:27,058 --> 00:24:28,571
I don't know,
something in Madrid.

202
00:24:28,658 --> 00:24:30,489
I went there
and then followed him here.

203
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:31,573
Can't I come in?

204
00:24:31,618 --> 00:24:34,815
No, I'm not allowed visitors.

205
00:24:35,298 --> 00:24:37,892
It smells good.
I'm hungry.

206
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,177
Brute!

207
00:24:50,178 --> 00:24:52,055
<i>The main new items today...

208
00:24:52,138 --> 00:24:54,777
<i>are the Carnival celebrations...

209
00:24:54,898 --> 00:24:57,935
<i>and the daring robbery committed
in the Bvlgari jewelry store...

210
00:24:57,978 --> 00:24:59,889
<i>in the heart of Madrid.

211
00:25:00,018 --> 00:25:01,246
<i>It happened last night...

212
00:25:01,378 --> 00:25:03,733
<i>and today we have the first images 
recorded by one...

213
00:25:03,778 --> 00:25:09,728
<i>of the twenty-four security cameras
which protect the jewelry store.

214
00:25:10,938 --> 00:25:13,168
<i>Apart from the thief,
who appears in the image...

215
00:25:13,218 --> 00:25:16,608
<i>police are looking
for one of the store's employees...

216
00:25:16,698 --> 00:25:20,532
<i>who has been missing
for the last twenty-four hours.

217
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:23,776
As if they were going to find him!

218
00:25:24,698 --> 00:25:26,893
The bastard just had to
turn off the cameras...

219
00:25:26,978 --> 00:25:29,208
but he changed his mind
and left one working.

220
00:25:29,338 --> 00:25:31,772
He'll be rotting in hell now.

221
00:25:31,938 --> 00:25:33,656
And the police are looking for you.

222
00:25:33,738 --> 00:25:37,492
Sure. If it weren't Carnival,
I couldn't go out.

223
00:25:37,858 --> 00:25:39,769
You can hide me here for a few days.

224
00:25:39,858 --> 00:25:41,257
Hide you here?

225
00:25:41,298 --> 00:25:42,367
Not a chance.

226
00:25:42,618 --> 00:25:45,212
We've got loads of patients.
A lot of people come here.

227
00:25:45,298 --> 00:25:47,209
I know how to hide.

228
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:50,728
Anyway, I want Robert
to operate on my face.

229
00:25:50,858 --> 00:25:52,496
Robert?

230
00:25:52,538 --> 00:25:54,529
When he gets you on the table...

231
00:25:54,578 --> 00:25:57,570
he'll give you a lethal injection!

232
00:25:57,858 --> 00:26:00,098
How could you think
he'd operate on you...

233
00:26:00,098 --> 00:26:01,497
after what you did?

234
00:26:01,538 --> 00:26:03,608
I'll have to blackmail him.

235
00:26:06,218 --> 00:26:09,369
If I kidnap you,
could I make him do it?

236
00:26:10,258 --> 00:26:12,647
You're raving mad.

237
00:26:13,018 --> 00:26:15,373
I'm just a servant.

238
00:26:15,778 --> 00:26:18,417
Anyway, Robert's out of Spain.

239
00:26:19,698 --> 00:26:21,211
Even better.

240
00:26:21,418 --> 00:26:23,773
I'll stay here till he comes back.

241
00:26:27,498 --> 00:26:28,817
Where are you going?

242
00:26:28,898 --> 00:26:31,253
- What do you want
- A drink.

243
00:26:33,778 --> 00:26:36,975
Take the bottle,
take what you want, just get out!

244
00:27:02,178 --> 00:27:03,327
What's this?

245
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:04,937
It's a film!

246
00:27:05,298 --> 00:27:06,731
Go away!

247
00:27:29,378 --> 00:27:33,087
- She reminds me of...
- She doesn't remind you of anybody!

248
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:35,291
Get out or I'll shoot.

249
00:27:36,498 --> 00:27:37,897
Mom...

250
00:27:38,538 --> 00:27:41,291
you wouldn't do that to your son.

251
00:27:42,058 --> 00:27:45,733
You're not my son.
I just gave birth to you.

252
00:27:46,418 --> 00:27:48,773
- It's her.
- It's not her!

253
00:27:48,858 --> 00:27:50,337
How could it be her?

254
00:27:50,738 --> 00:27:52,330
Get out of here!

255
00:27:52,458 --> 00:27:53,811
Keep away!

256
00:28:00,898 --> 00:28:02,536
Marilia?

257
00:28:03,258 --> 00:28:05,647
I heard a noise, like a shot.

258
00:28:06,178 --> 00:28:07,611
Is anything wrong?

259
00:28:07,698 --> 00:28:09,575
<i>I heard voices too.

260
00:28:10,618 --> 00:28:12,176
<i>Marilia?

261
00:28:12,498 --> 00:28:13,931
Marilia!

262
00:28:35,738 --> 00:28:37,217
There.

263
00:30:02,058 --> 00:30:02,934
Who is it?

264
00:30:03,058 --> 00:30:04,935
It's me, Zeca. Open the door.

265
00:30:05,458 --> 00:30:06,777
I can't.

266
00:30:06,898 --> 00:30:09,696
- Why not?
- I haven't got the key.

267
00:30:09,898 --> 00:30:11,456
Does Marilia have it?

268
00:30:11,698 --> 00:30:13,893
- I don't know. 
- What are you doing here?

269
00:30:35,818 --> 00:30:38,127
If you scream, I'll break your jaw.

270
00:30:46,018 --> 00:30:48,134
Where's the key to upstairs?

271
00:30:49,098 --> 00:30:51,134
In the drawer at the corner.

272
00:30:51,618 --> 00:30:53,370
Untie me and I'll give it to you.

273
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:55,056
No, where is it?

274
00:30:55,778 --> 00:30:59,293
In that drawer, in an envelope.

275
00:31:05,498 --> 00:31:07,693
- It's not here!
- At the back!

276
00:31:13,018 --> 00:31:14,770
There's just an envelope
that says "clips".

277
00:31:14,898 --> 00:31:18,686
- That's to fool people, idiot!
- Look inside.

278
00:31:24,498 --> 00:31:28,286
No. Not the napkin. No, no, no!

279
00:31:28,378 --> 00:31:30,767
- Yes, or else you'll scream.
- No, untie me, please!

280
00:31:30,898 --> 00:31:32,172
Open your mouth!

281
00:31:33,778 --> 00:31:37,566
Open it wider, mom!

282
00:31:38,698 --> 00:31:41,132
It all fit before.

283
00:32:25,858 --> 00:32:27,496
Did Robert send you?

284
00:32:28,458 --> 00:32:29,686
No.

285
00:32:29,858 --> 00:32:33,214
How did you survive?
I left you burning like a torch.

286
00:32:37,018 --> 00:32:39,737
He saved me.

287
00:32:41,218 --> 00:32:43,209
Get me out of here!

288
00:32:43,298 --> 00:32:45,254
I'll go anywhere with you!

289
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:48,416
You're saying that...

290
00:32:48,498 --> 00:32:50,170
because I'm on top of you.

291
00:32:51,018 --> 00:32:52,292
No!

292
00:32:52,898 --> 00:32:56,368
Ask me for anything!

293
00:32:56,418 --> 00:32:59,296
What can you give me,
apart from a great fuck?

294
00:32:59,418 --> 00:33:01,886
I don't know. Lots of things!

295
00:33:02,298 --> 00:33:03,856
I'll do whatever you want.

296
00:33:06,058 --> 00:33:08,014
You could help me with Robert.

297
00:33:08,138 --> 00:33:09,856
How do you get on with him now?

298
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,217
Great.

299
00:33:13,018 --> 00:33:15,293
- Great?
- Yes.

300
00:33:15,738 --> 00:33:18,969
- And he still locks you in?
- You know what he's like!

301
00:33:19,058 --> 00:33:20,457
Yes.

302
00:33:22,218 --> 00:33:24,368
I'll take you with me.

303
00:33:24,498 --> 00:33:26,375
That might soften his heart
and he'll fix my face.

304
00:33:27,418 --> 00:33:31,616
If you kidnap me,
you can ask him for anything!

305
00:33:33,138 --> 00:33:35,698
I'll kidnap you, but first we'll fuck.

306
00:33:40,538 --> 00:33:41,732
Listen...

307
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:43,368
What?

308
00:33:43,458 --> 00:33:45,653
Lets fuck in the garden, please!

309
00:33:45,738 --> 00:33:49,492
The garden? Why?
I'm sick of screwing in the open air.

310
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:51,575
This tiger wants a bed.

311
00:33:58,018 --> 00:33:59,656
Don't you like it?

312
00:33:59,978 --> 00:34:01,377
You're hurting me.

313
00:34:02,058 --> 00:34:03,537
It's very big.

314
00:34:03,658 --> 00:34:06,297
It's like it always was.
It used to drive you crazy.

315
00:34:06,818 --> 00:34:07,738
Yes...

316
00:34:07,738 --> 00:34:10,298
and it still does.
It drives me crazy!

317
00:34:10,538 --> 00:34:14,929
Shut up! You're weird,
you're distracting me.

318
00:35:25,618 --> 00:35:27,210
Kill her!

319
00:35:28,338 --> 00:35:29,771
Kill them both!

320
00:35:58,178 --> 00:36:01,295
As children,
they played at killing each other.

321
00:36:02,458 --> 00:36:05,689
I knew that one day
they'd do it for real.

322
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:09,734
The tiger and Robert?

323
00:36:10,338 --> 00:36:11,691
Yes.

324
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:13,891
They're brothers...

325
00:36:14,858 --> 00:36:16,894
but they don't know it.

326
00:36:17,618 --> 00:36:19,848
At least I've never told them.

327
00:36:21,818 --> 00:36:25,333
I had Zeca by a servant
who disappeared soon after.

328
00:36:26,378 --> 00:36:30,974
And Robert is the son of Mr. Ledgard.

329
00:36:31,338 --> 00:36:36,207
Their fathers were very different
but both were born insane.

330
00:36:38,418 --> 00:36:40,534
It's my fault.

331
00:36:46,738 --> 00:36:49,889
I've got insanity in my entrails.

332
00:36:50,418 --> 00:36:52,978
I'd served at the Ledgards' house
since I was a child.

333
00:36:53,098 --> 00:36:55,293
Mrs. Ledgard was sterile...

334
00:36:55,858 --> 00:37:00,249
and when my Robert was born,
they kept him...

335
00:37:02,058 --> 00:37:04,697
and said she'd given birth to him.

336
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:10,173
But I was the one who looked after him
from the day he was born.

337
00:37:12,218 --> 00:37:14,971
Zeca spoke to me as if he knew me.

338
00:37:15,138 --> 00:37:19,131
He mistook you for Gal,
Robert's wife.

339
00:37:21,098 --> 00:37:24,693
Unlike Robert,
Zeca grew up far from me.

340
00:37:26,898 --> 00:37:30,413
When he was seven,
he started transporting drugs.

341
00:37:30,538 --> 00:37:34,417
I never saw him.
He grew up on the street.

342
00:37:36,738 --> 00:37:43,655
About twelve years ago
Zeca came back to the house.

343
00:37:44,698 --> 00:37:47,496
He was on the run
and asked us for shelter.

344
00:37:48,938 --> 00:37:51,088
I hid him in an outhouse,
but Gal found him...

345
00:37:51,898 --> 00:37:54,890
she took a fancy to him...

346
00:37:55,058 --> 00:37:57,413
and they ended up
running away together.

347
00:37:59,618 --> 00:38:01,973
Their car crashed,

348
00:38:02,618 --> 00:38:04,688
Zeca survived and ran away.

349
00:38:06,378 --> 00:38:08,209
But she...

350
00:38:11,058 --> 00:38:17,133
Robert found her, horribly burned,
but still with a flicker of life.

351
00:38:20,738 --> 00:38:24,287
He snatched her back from death
at the last minute.

352
00:38:26,498 --> 00:38:31,891
He worked day and night.
He did endless research.

353
00:38:32,298 --> 00:38:33,811
He didn't sleep.

354
00:38:36,098 --> 00:38:40,250
He only rested when he sat
by the bed where she was lying...

355
00:38:40,378 --> 00:38:42,687
covered with gauzes.

356
00:38:43,618 --> 00:38:47,293
He was intoxicated
by the smell of burned flesh.

357
00:38:48,778 --> 00:38:51,497
After the accident,
we lived like vampires...

358
00:38:53,258 --> 00:38:56,330
in total darkness and with no mirrors.

359
00:38:58,778 --> 00:39:00,973
To everyone's surprise...

360
00:39:01,098 --> 00:39:03,976
after several endless months,
Gal started to improve.

361
00:39:05,978 --> 00:39:09,015
The things that a madman's love can do!

362
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:15,688
One day...

363
00:39:17,178 --> 00:39:20,375
when she could finally stand unaided...

364
00:39:21,978 --> 00:39:25,414
Gal heard Norma's voice in the distance...

365
00:39:26,098 --> 00:39:29,647
singing a song that she had taught her.

366
00:39:31,898 --> 00:39:34,458
And she got emotional.

367
00:39:36,018 --> 00:39:41,138
For the first time in many months,
she got emotional.

368
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,771
And it was...

369
00:39:44,578 --> 00:39:47,729
like feeling she was alive again.

370
00:40:23,138 --> 00:40:25,698
When she opened the window...

371
00:40:27,178 --> 00:40:31,057
she suddenly saw her image
reflected in the glass.

372
00:40:38,698 --> 00:40:41,451
She didn't look human.

373
00:40:42,018 --> 00:40:44,327
She was a cinder.

374
00:40:47,938 --> 00:40:50,452
She gave a scream
that echoed through the house...

375
00:40:50,618 --> 00:40:52,688
and threw herself out the window.

376
00:41:04,778 --> 00:41:07,656
Years later, little Norma...

377
00:41:08,658 --> 00:41:11,570
went in search of her mother...

378
00:41:12,778 --> 00:41:16,532
along the same road
her mother had taken.

379
00:41:19,338 --> 00:41:21,408
Through the window.

380
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:02,530
- What did you do with the body?
- I buried it well.

381
00:42:02,658 --> 00:42:04,091
Did you pray?

382
00:42:04,178 --> 00:42:07,295
Yes.
Everything you told me.

383
00:42:12,298 --> 00:42:14,095
Shall we go inside?

384
00:42:51,138 --> 00:42:53,811
Do you mind if we
leave it

385
00:42:53,898 --> 00:42:55,456
for tomorrow?

386
00:42:56,858 --> 00:42:59,736
The tiger really messed me up.

387
00:43:00,538 --> 00:43:02,290
As you wish.

388
00:43:06,018 --> 00:43:07,576
But hold me!

389
00:43:14,298 --> 00:43:16,687
Don't worry, I'll wait.

390
00:43:17,538 --> 00:43:20,291
I don't want you to feel uncomfortable.

391
00:43:20,738 --> 00:43:22,217
Thank you!

392
00:43:37,098 --> 00:43:39,373
I'm falling asleep.

393
00:43:46,578 --> 00:43:48,534
Sleep, my love.

394
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:09,850
SIX YEARS EARLIER

395
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:43,053
Thank you.
I owe this wedding to you.

396
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:45,652
Don't exaggerate.
Nico adores you.

397
00:44:47,978 --> 00:44:50,492
Without your help, he'd adore me less.

398
00:44:50,618 --> 00:44:52,927
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

399
00:44:59,418 --> 00:45:02,171
Your daughter is getting on well
with my nieces.

400
00:45:02,858 --> 00:45:04,530
She seems much better...

401
00:45:04,698 --> 00:45:07,292
At least she isn't afraid of people now.

402
00:45:07,858 --> 00:45:10,850
Yes, it's odd she hasn't come
to ask if we can leave.

403
00:45:10,938 --> 00:45:14,135
She's great!
And she's having a wonderful time.

404
00:45:27,498 --> 00:45:28,931
To you!

405
00:46:18,298 --> 00:46:20,732
You've had him long enough,
it's my turn.

406
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,336
Enjoy him, darling.

407
00:46:34,378 --> 00:46:35,731
Excuse me.

408
00:48:39,898 --> 00:48:41,490
Norma!

409
00:48:41,618 --> 00:48:43,097
Norma!

410
00:48:43,498 --> 00:48:45,170
Norma!

411
00:48:45,378 --> 00:48:46,936
Norma!

412
00:48:47,098 --> 00:48:48,611
Norma!

413
00:48:48,818 --> 00:48:52,128
Sweetheart, it's me!

414
00:48:56,858 --> 00:48:59,247
There, there!

415
00:50:04,618 --> 00:50:05,767
What about this one?

416
00:50:05,858 --> 00:50:07,007
Yes, but...

417
00:50:07,098 --> 00:50:08,213
no.

418
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,407
And it looks a bit old.

419
00:50:09,498 --> 00:50:11,614
It's not old, it's vintage.

420
00:50:11,698 --> 00:50:14,053
- Maybe something flowery?
- No, no flowers.

421
00:50:14,138 --> 00:50:16,527
No flowers.
Something like this?

422
00:50:16,658 --> 00:50:18,091
Not stripes either.

423
00:50:18,218 --> 00:50:19,537
No stripes.

424
00:50:30,298 --> 00:50:31,777
Something graphic?

425
00:50:31,898 --> 00:50:34,412
Graphic?
Like this?

426
00:50:34,458 --> 00:50:36,335
I'll come back another day.

427
00:50:36,418 --> 00:50:39,410
Yes, do that, you're dopey today.

428
00:50:43,138 --> 00:50:44,253
Cristina...

429
00:50:45,218 --> 00:50:47,129
Here. On the house.

430
00:50:47,218 --> 00:50:49,049
Put it on and we'll go partying.

431
00:50:49,178 --> 00:50:50,657
I'm meeting my girlfriend.

432
00:50:50,818 --> 00:50:53,286
Put it on anyway.
I'd like to see you in it.

433
00:50:54,858 --> 00:50:56,849
It'll look great on you.

434
00:50:56,978 --> 00:50:58,889
If you like it so much, wear it yourself.

435
00:50:59,978 --> 00:51:01,616
You're so mistaken!

436
00:51:01,698 --> 00:51:03,529
Because I don't like men?

437
00:51:03,778 --> 00:51:05,814
Because you don't like me.

438
00:51:06,458 --> 00:51:07,971
In any case...

439
00:51:08,418 --> 00:51:11,649
I've got pills to get you in the mood.

440
00:51:11,778 --> 00:51:13,734
You shouldn't take that shit.

441
00:51:16,778 --> 00:51:18,769
Vicente, leave Cristina alone!

442
00:51:19,538 --> 00:51:21,017
I'm off.

443
00:51:21,458 --> 00:51:22,777
Where to?

444
00:51:22,898 --> 00:51:24,217
Home, to get changed.

445
00:51:24,298 --> 00:51:25,492
How come?

446
00:51:26,058 --> 00:51:27,047
I'm meeting my pals.

447
00:51:27,138 --> 00:51:29,572
I think we're going to Casilda's party.

448
00:51:29,778 --> 00:51:30,767
Were you invited?

449
00:51:30,858 --> 00:51:32,849
Jorge knows one of the nieces.

450
00:51:32,938 --> 00:51:34,610
We're just going to the dance.

451
00:51:35,458 --> 00:51:37,767
Well? Are you coming?

452
00:51:38,018 --> 00:51:40,088
Leave her alone, you pain.

453
00:51:41,938 --> 00:51:43,212
Good afternoon.

454
00:51:43,378 --> 00:51:44,777
Hello.

455
00:51:46,058 --> 00:51:48,094
My wife has left us...

456
00:51:48,178 --> 00:51:50,612
and I was wondering
if you'd want her clothes.

457
00:51:51,418 --> 00:51:53,534
- Josefina?
- Yes.

458
00:51:55,018 --> 00:51:56,337
Well...

459
00:51:56,538 --> 00:51:58,654
we don't have anything for fat women...

460
00:52:00,138 --> 00:52:04,616
If you're interested,
I'll let you check them out.

461
00:52:04,698 --> 00:52:06,290
They're very nice.

462
00:52:06,618 --> 00:52:08,529
We'll look at them and let you know.

463
00:52:08,658 --> 00:52:12,094
- Of course.
- It's this, right?

464
00:52:12,138 --> 00:52:13,048
Yes.
It's heavy.

465
00:52:13,138 --> 00:52:14,491
It certainly is.

466
00:52:14,578 --> 00:52:15,897
But...

467
00:52:16,298 --> 00:52:18,493
did she leave or has she disappeared?

468
00:52:18,698 --> 00:52:20,575
Both things.
To be honest...

469
00:52:20,658 --> 00:52:23,536
she does it regularly.
We're used to it.

470
00:52:23,618 --> 00:52:25,256
So the next time she does it...

471
00:52:25,338 --> 00:52:28,296
she'll have to leave naked
because I'm selling her clothes.

472
00:53:12,658 --> 00:53:15,047
I'll show you the garden.

473
00:53:15,138 --> 00:53:17,777
What a party!

474
00:53:17,898 --> 00:53:19,297
Fresh air!

475
00:53:20,978 --> 00:53:23,890
You're all stoners!

476
00:53:26,938 --> 00:53:28,576
I'm Vicente.

477
00:53:29,418 --> 00:53:30,931
I'm Norma.

478
00:53:34,898 --> 00:53:36,616
Your friends have gone.

479
00:53:37,778 --> 00:53:39,973
All the better, right?

480
00:53:52,618 --> 00:53:54,051
Are you stoned?

481
00:53:54,738 --> 00:53:56,091
Stoned?

482
00:53:56,578 --> 00:53:58,455
Have you taken any pills?

483
00:53:59,138 --> 00:54:00,856
Yes.

484
00:54:01,458 --> 00:54:03,369
Cipralex 20...

485
00:54:04,298 --> 00:54:07,017
100 mg of Deprax...

486
00:54:08,258 --> 00:54:10,249
2 g of Trankimazin.

487
00:54:10,338 --> 00:54:11,930
I don't take Rohipnol now.

488
00:54:12,298 --> 00:54:14,653
And Lyrica, of course.

489
00:54:14,778 --> 00:54:16,006
Shit!

490
00:54:16,138 --> 00:54:18,015
I'm high as hell too.

491
00:54:18,138 --> 00:54:19,412
High?

492
00:54:19,858 --> 00:54:21,211
Yes.

493
00:54:26,018 --> 00:54:27,849
You're not from here, are you?

494
00:54:27,978 --> 00:54:29,969
No. Are you?

495
00:54:30,258 --> 00:54:32,772
Yes, but I want to get away...

496
00:54:51,058 --> 00:54:53,731
I'm sick of these high heels!

497
00:54:59,418 --> 00:55:00,931
And this jacket!

498
00:55:02,378 --> 00:55:06,132
All these clothes give me claustrophobia.

499
00:55:06,538 --> 00:55:10,167
If I could, I'd go naked all the time.

500
00:55:12,338 --> 00:55:13,566
Wait.

501
00:55:14,538 --> 00:55:16,176
I'll leave you naked.

502
00:55:54,858 --> 00:55:56,530
You're so pretty...

503
00:55:58,338 --> 00:55:59,817
and different.

504
00:56:01,898 --> 00:56:03,536
I'm different too.

505
00:56:03,898 --> 00:56:05,889
Are you in treatment too?

506
00:56:07,618 --> 00:56:08,653
No.

507
00:56:08,738 --> 00:56:10,694
Do you think I should be?

508
00:56:10,778 --> 00:56:12,131
I don't know.

509
00:56:12,778 --> 00:56:16,168
And now, on the groom's request,
I'm going to sing...

510
00:56:16,338 --> 00:56:17,612
"I Need To Love".

511
00:56:17,698 --> 00:56:19,575
This is also for the bride...

512
00:56:19,698 --> 00:56:21,370
with all my affection.

513
00:57:18,498 --> 00:57:23,572
No!

514
00:57:28,258 --> 00:57:30,214
Shut up!

515
00:57:32,578 --> 00:57:34,648
Stop!

516
00:59:05,178 --> 00:59:06,657
Cristina...

517
00:59:06,778 --> 00:59:09,895
If I left, you'd stay here
with my mother, wouldn't you?

518
00:59:10,178 --> 00:59:11,497
Yes...

519
00:59:11,578 --> 00:59:13,296
but where are you going?

520
00:59:13,378 --> 00:59:16,211
I don't know.
I'm sick of the town.

521
00:59:16,378 --> 00:59:17,891
That's because of all the stuff you take.

522
00:59:17,938 --> 00:59:19,371
I haven't taken anything in a week.

523
00:59:19,458 --> 00:59:21,016
Then it's because of that.

524
00:59:21,738 --> 00:59:23,774
So should I take it or not?

525
00:59:23,818 --> 00:59:25,297
It's best not to.

526
00:59:27,138 --> 00:59:28,617
I'm going out.

527
00:59:29,058 --> 00:59:30,889
Now? Without finishing it?

528
00:59:30,938 --> 00:59:31,848
Yes.

529
00:59:34,258 --> 00:59:36,931
Are you coming for supper
or will you be late?

530
00:59:37,018 --> 00:59:39,612
I'll be home for supper,
I just need some air.

531
00:59:39,658 --> 00:59:42,570
Leave it mom, I can do it.
Pass me my helmet.

532
00:59:43,778 --> 00:59:45,734
Are you leaving that mess?

533
00:59:45,778 --> 00:59:48,133
I'll finish it tomorrow.

534
01:00:40,338 --> 01:00:43,410
What are you doing, asshole?
Are you crazy?

535
01:01:22,698 --> 01:01:24,256
Son of a bitch!

536
01:01:25,138 --> 01:01:27,447
Bastard!

537
01:01:35,298 --> 01:01:36,777
Are you crazy?

538
01:01:37,018 --> 01:01:40,055
Don't shoot!

539
01:03:31,458 --> 01:03:33,494
Help!

540
01:03:37,498 --> 01:03:38,931
<i>Help!

541
01:03:50,778 --> 01:03:52,131
Come in.

542
01:03:54,018 --> 01:03:55,292
Sit down, please.

543
01:03:57,178 --> 01:03:58,531
Thank you.

544
01:04:00,498 --> 01:04:02,409
I was told there's news.

545
01:04:03,538 --> 01:04:07,770
We found the bike, totally destroyed,
at the Finisterre cliffs.

546
01:04:09,378 --> 01:04:10,891
And the body?

547
01:04:11,298 --> 01:04:12,572
Nothing.

548
01:04:13,058 --> 01:04:15,128
It must have been washed out to sea.

549
01:04:19,538 --> 01:04:21,256
We're very sorry, ma'am.

550
01:04:22,418 --> 01:04:24,056
My son is alive.

551
01:04:25,658 --> 01:04:28,695
- As we said...
- Yes, you found the bike...

552
01:04:28,738 --> 01:04:30,296
but my son?

553
01:04:31,738 --> 01:04:34,127
He could have been kidnapped.

554
01:04:36,698 --> 01:04:39,929
Until his body appears,
you must keep looking, please!

555
01:04:40,018 --> 01:04:41,895
We've talked about this already, ma'am.

556
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:45,857
You have to keep looking.
My son is alive!

557
01:04:45,938 --> 01:04:48,406
If he is, he's far away.

558
01:04:50,498 --> 01:04:53,570
All his friends that were questioned,
even your assistant...

559
01:04:53,658 --> 01:04:56,730
all say he was fed up and wanted to leave.

560
01:04:56,778 --> 01:04:58,450
But he said he'd be home for supper.

561
01:04:58,498 --> 01:04:59,772
Cristina heard him.

562
01:04:59,938 --> 01:05:03,248
If he didn't call me,
it's because something happened.

563
01:05:19,858 --> 01:05:21,735
NEUROPSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE

564
01:05:35,778 --> 01:05:39,327
It's me, Norma.
It's dad.

565
01:05:42,258 --> 01:05:44,249
Norma...

566
01:05:46,058 --> 01:05:47,047
Sweetheart...

567
01:05:47,098 --> 01:05:48,292
Sweetheart...

568
01:05:48,378 --> 01:05:51,211
I won't touch you.

569
01:05:53,418 --> 01:05:54,931
Where are you going?

570
01:06:01,578 --> 01:06:03,216
Where are you going?

571
01:06:10,858 --> 01:06:12,849
Norma, love.

572
01:06:17,178 --> 01:06:18,213
Everything OK?

573
01:06:18,258 --> 01:06:20,567
Yes.

574
01:06:25,018 --> 01:06:26,690
It's me, Norma.

575
01:06:26,778 --> 01:06:29,008
You can come out,
the men have gone.

576
01:06:29,138 --> 01:06:33,017
Can't you put her in a dress?
In that gown she looks worse than she is.

577
01:06:33,098 --> 01:06:34,531
We tried...

578
01:06:35,058 --> 01:06:38,050
but she can't stand
any kind of fitted clothing.

579
01:06:38,138 --> 01:06:39,730
She rips it off.

580
01:06:41,458 --> 01:06:45,371
Dr. Ledgard, I don't think
you should visit her so often.

581
01:06:46,458 --> 01:06:49,609
- She's my daughter!
- But she doesn't recognize you.

582
01:06:49,778 --> 01:06:51,769
And she gets worse when she sees you.

583
01:06:51,858 --> 01:06:54,770
In her mind,
she's convinced you attacked her.

584
01:06:54,898 --> 01:06:56,217
I just found her lying there!

585
01:06:56,298 --> 01:06:58,573
Why can't you get that into her head?

586
01:06:58,658 --> 01:07:01,297
She identifies you with the rapist.

587
01:07:02,338 --> 01:07:03,566
Maybe...

588
01:07:03,658 --> 01:07:06,411
we let her out too soon.

589
01:07:06,578 --> 01:07:09,092
It was your idea
that she should socialize.

590
01:07:09,138 --> 01:07:11,652
She was getting over her social phobia.

591
01:07:11,778 --> 01:07:12,767
How could I know...

592
01:07:12,818 --> 01:07:15,651
someone would try to
rape her while she was with you.

593
01:08:38,218 --> 01:08:42,894
Over here!
Please! Get me out of here!

594
01:08:42,978 --> 01:08:45,776
Help!
Get me out of here!

595
01:08:46,898 --> 01:08:50,334
I'm thirsty and I'm starving.

596
01:08:50,738 --> 01:08:52,456
You'll eat and drink now.

597
01:08:52,538 --> 01:08:55,530
I haven't done anything!
This is a mistake!

598
01:08:55,658 --> 01:08:58,616
Possibly.
Everyone makes mistakes.

599
01:08:59,538 --> 01:09:02,211
Come over here, you bastard,
and set me free!

600
01:09:13,178 --> 01:09:14,497
Turn around!

601
01:09:44,218 --> 01:09:46,652
I'm chaining you nearer to the table.

602
01:09:46,778 --> 01:09:49,929
But, why?
I haven't done anything.

603
01:09:50,898 --> 01:09:52,934
You'll be more comfortable there.

604
01:10:28,698 --> 01:10:30,131
Eat.

605
01:10:31,498 --> 01:10:32,851
Thank you!

606
01:10:38,618 --> 01:10:40,768
Sorry if I annoyed you the other day.

607
01:10:41,578 --> 01:10:43,933
I've been alone for so long.

608
01:10:46,698 --> 01:10:49,770
Wait, please! Don't go!

609
01:10:53,658 --> 01:10:55,728
Please, don't go!

610
01:10:55,898 --> 01:10:57,854
We have to talk.

611
01:11:24,698 --> 01:11:26,097
My condolences.

612
01:11:29,458 --> 01:11:31,369
We did what we could.

613
01:11:31,658 --> 01:11:34,047
It wasn't enough
and you did it very badly.

614
01:11:34,178 --> 01:11:35,975
I'm going to report the hospital,
and you in particular...

615
01:11:36,058 --> 01:11:37,616
for homicidal negligence.

616
01:11:37,658 --> 01:11:40,297
- Please, this isn't the place.
- Please...

617
01:11:43,858 --> 01:11:45,610
You really want to work today?

618
01:11:45,698 --> 01:11:46,813
Yes.

619
01:11:46,938 --> 01:11:49,930
You should rest and try to forget.

620
01:11:50,018 --> 01:11:52,976
I couldn't sleep, and working
will keep my mind occupied.

621
01:11:53,058 --> 01:11:55,447
- Call the whole team.
- OK.

622
01:12:12,858 --> 01:12:14,769
My mother will be very worried.

623
01:12:15,498 --> 01:12:17,887
I never stay away without calling her.

624
01:12:27,418 --> 01:12:29,409
You have a daughter, haven't you?

625
01:12:35,258 --> 01:12:36,930
Why do you say that?

626
01:12:38,458 --> 01:12:40,289
The toys...

627
01:12:40,378 --> 01:12:42,050
My daughter is dead.

628
01:12:43,778 --> 01:12:46,246
We buried her today.

629
01:12:48,738 --> 01:12:50,569
I'm sorry.

630
01:12:59,298 --> 01:13:01,858
And now, some aftershave.

631
01:13:04,458 --> 01:13:06,414
Why did you shave me?

632
01:13:06,858 --> 01:13:08,769
That's a good question.

633
01:14:00,058 --> 01:14:01,013
Yes?

634
01:14:01,058 --> 01:14:02,377
<i>It's us.

635
01:14:02,498 --> 01:14:03,851
I'll let you in.

636
01:14:22,218 --> 01:14:23,731
If he says we're late,

637
01:14:23,778 --> 01:14:25,928
say there were two 
accidents on the road

638
01:14:26,178 --> 01:14:27,975
You know how he is about punctuality.

639
01:14:31,298 --> 01:14:32,856
Good evening.

640
01:14:32,938 --> 01:14:34,212
You're late.

641
01:14:34,378 --> 01:14:36,130
There were two accidents on the road.

642
01:14:36,538 --> 01:14:39,098
Here's the paperwork and envelopes.

643
01:14:39,178 --> 01:14:41,408
When you're ready, we'll start.

644
01:14:41,898 --> 01:14:45,617
Two accidents, one near that town...

645
01:15:24,778 --> 01:15:28,134
He's very young.
He looks like a boy.

646
01:15:28,898 --> 01:15:30,536
He isn't.

647
01:15:31,258 --> 01:15:34,295
He's 27 and he knows
exactly what he wants.

648
01:15:34,418 --> 01:15:37,296
It's a particularly confidential case.

649
01:16:11,378 --> 01:16:13,255
What's happened?

650
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:19,575
What did you do to me?

651
01:16:20,218 --> 01:16:22,368
A vaginoplasty

652
01:16:31,298 --> 01:16:33,095
No...

653
01:17:18,098 --> 01:17:20,612
Listen carefully to what I'm going to say.

654
01:17:20,698 --> 01:17:22,256
It's very important.

655
01:17:24,498 --> 01:17:27,695
As you've just seen,
the operation was successful...

656
01:17:27,898 --> 01:17:32,449
but the tissues of the vagina are still 
very tender and could stick together.

657
01:17:32,538 --> 01:17:35,575
But don't worry,
it's easy to prevent that.

658
01:17:35,818 --> 01:17:37,046
You...

659
01:17:38,298 --> 01:17:41,017
You have to keep the new orifice open...

660
01:17:41,098 --> 01:17:44,329
and manage, bit by bit, to make it deeper.

661
01:17:45,418 --> 01:17:49,855
Think that your life
depends on that orifice...

662
01:17:49,938 --> 01:17:52,213
that you breathe through it.

663
01:17:53,858 --> 01:17:55,177
In this case...

664
01:17:56,698 --> 01:17:59,770
there are several dilators
of different sizes.

665
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:06,376
Start by inserting the smallest one.

666
01:18:08,618 --> 01:18:10,768
It will hurt at first...

667
01:18:11,578 --> 01:18:14,012
but in a few months...

668
01:18:14,138 --> 01:18:17,096
the largest one will fit without any effort...

669
01:18:17,218 --> 01:18:18,856
and the skin...

670
01:18:19,018 --> 01:18:22,931
will be perfectly healed.

671
01:18:31,058 --> 01:18:34,528
This is very good.

672
01:18:36,258 --> 01:18:38,613
How long have you been using
the last dilator?

673
01:18:38,698 --> 01:18:40,290
Four weeks.

674
01:18:40,618 --> 01:18:42,097
Can I go now?

675
01:18:42,498 --> 01:18:44,966
- Go where?
- Home.

676
01:18:45,458 --> 01:18:47,335
But we've just started.

677
01:19:01,658 --> 01:19:03,535
What else are you going to do?

678
01:19:05,498 --> 01:19:08,012
You'll see, when the time comes.

679
01:19:10,098 --> 01:19:12,293
Why are you doing this?

680
01:19:19,858 --> 01:19:22,292
Do you remember 
Casilda Efraiz's wedding?

681
01:19:23,418 --> 01:19:25,852
In that spectacular house?

682
01:19:27,178 --> 01:19:31,251
I'm Norma's father.
She was the child you raped.

683
01:19:32,778 --> 01:19:34,734
I don't think I actually raped her.

684
01:19:34,778 --> 01:19:38,930
You "don't think"?
Have you lost your memory?

685
01:19:39,858 --> 01:19:44,534
I'd taken a lot of pills
and I can hardly remember it.

686
01:19:44,578 --> 01:19:48,935
Well I didn't take anything
and I'll never forget it!

687
01:19:49,018 --> 01:19:50,736
What are you going to do now?

688
01:20:10,938 --> 01:20:14,567
It's a pity you can't see your whole body.

689
01:20:18,258 --> 01:20:21,568
They don't seem pneumatic now, do they?

690
01:20:21,658 --> 01:20:25,697
They're like drops of water
sliding along a glass surface.

691
01:20:34,178 --> 01:20:36,931
The marks on your skin will disappear.

692
01:20:37,538 --> 01:20:39,893
There's still work to do.

693
01:20:40,938 --> 01:20:45,216
But to put you mind at ease,
there'll be no more burns.

694
01:20:47,858 --> 01:20:52,409
I've bought you this body stocking.
It'll protect your skin.

695
01:20:52,498 --> 01:20:55,695
It'll also give you support
and mold you.

696
01:20:56,338 --> 01:21:00,456
Get used to wearing it all the time...

697
01:21:01,698 --> 01:21:03,131
like a second skin.

698
01:21:04,498 --> 01:21:05,977
Put it on.

699
01:21:49,658 --> 01:21:51,853
Will you zip me up, please?

700
01:22:11,498 --> 01:22:12,772
Bitch!

701
01:22:59,458 --> 01:23:00,777
Stop!

702
01:23:02,018 --> 01:23:04,407
Give me the key
or I'll come up and stab you!

703
01:23:06,458 --> 01:23:08,096
Stay where you are!

704
01:23:23,338 --> 01:23:25,090
I'll slit my throat...

705
01:23:25,138 --> 01:23:27,129
and then you'll have no toy!

706
01:23:28,258 --> 01:23:29,930
You wouldn't dare.

707
01:24:03,538 --> 01:24:05,256
We were lucky.

708
01:24:06,938 --> 01:24:08,656
SEVERAL WEEKS LATER

709
01:24:50,818 --> 01:24:53,491
I can't keep calling you Vicente.

710
01:24:56,378 --> 01:25:00,530
From today, your name is Vera.

711
01:26:43,378 --> 01:26:45,687
I don't know if you're there.

712
01:26:45,778 --> 01:26:48,087
I'm returning the makeup book
and the makeup.

713
01:26:48,178 --> 01:26:49,770
Do what you want with them.

714
01:27:11,658 --> 01:27:14,126
<i>...and you can practice it anywhere...

715
01:27:14,178 --> 01:27:16,931
<i>on a hospital bed, in jail.

716
01:27:36,698 --> 01:27:39,770
<i>There's a place where you can take refuge...

717
01:27:40,218 --> 01:27:42,891
<i>a place inside you...

718
01:27:42,978 --> 01:27:44,696
<i>a place to which...

719
01:27:44,778 --> 01:27:47,008
<i>no one else has access...

720
01:27:47,058 --> 01:27:49,618
<i>a place that no one can destroy.

721
01:27:50,138 --> 01:27:52,333
<i>To access that place there is yoga...

722
01:27:52,578 --> 01:27:55,376
<i>an ancient technique.

723
01:27:56,218 --> 01:27:59,574
<i>It's a place where you'll find peace,
where you'll find tranquility...

724
01:27:59,618 --> 01:28:01,176
<i>freedom.

725
01:28:01,298 --> 01:28:02,936
<i>But you must practice it...

726
01:28:03,018 --> 01:28:05,532
<i>continuously, intensely...

727
01:28:05,618 --> 01:28:09,770
<i>and then you'll achieve it.

YOGA BOOKS

729
01:29:11,018 --> 01:29:12,849
My Cigarral!

730
01:29:13,658 --> 01:29:15,489
I missed it so much!

731
01:29:16,978 --> 01:29:19,572
These four years seemed eternal!

732
01:29:19,698 --> 01:29:23,247
- Was it that long?
- Four years and two months.

733
01:29:23,778 --> 01:29:26,338
I thought you'd forgotten me.

734
01:29:27,138 --> 01:29:28,776
I thought that...

735
01:29:28,938 --> 01:29:32,055
at least you'd have called me
when Norma died.

736
01:29:32,578 --> 01:29:34,648
My poor child.

737
01:29:34,898 --> 01:29:36,889
To throw herself out the window!

738
01:29:37,018 --> 01:29:39,327
I'd rather not talk about it.

739
01:29:39,978 --> 01:29:41,775
As you wish.

740
01:29:42,738 --> 01:29:45,047
But I'm going to miss her so much!

741
01:29:46,818 --> 01:29:48,695
Let's go to the kitchen.

742
01:29:49,098 --> 01:29:50,451
I'm parched.

743
01:29:54,338 --> 01:29:56,215
Don't look at the surfaces.

744
01:29:57,938 --> 01:30:00,168
Everything has to be cleaned.

745
01:30:00,378 --> 01:30:03,768
Call the agency
and hire the help you need.

746
01:30:04,098 --> 01:30:06,373
You've installed more televisions.

747
01:30:06,498 --> 01:30:10,616
They're not televisions.
It's to control a patient.

748
01:30:10,738 --> 01:30:12,456
I'll explain.

749
01:30:13,298 --> 01:30:15,687
From now on, you'll look after her.

750
01:30:15,778 --> 01:30:19,532
But you don't have to go into her room.
She cleans it.

751
01:30:21,458 --> 01:30:25,292
- Are there more patients
- No. She's the only one.

752
01:30:45,218 --> 01:30:46,856
You've put on your uniform.

753
01:30:47,538 --> 01:30:49,893
You don't have to wear it.

754
01:30:49,938 --> 01:30:51,417
I like the uniform...

755
01:30:51,538 --> 01:30:54,052
because it means we're together again.

756
01:31:01,658 --> 01:31:03,091
Who is she?

757
01:31:04,298 --> 01:31:06,334
I told you.
Her name's Vera.

758
01:31:07,098 --> 01:31:08,770
What's she doing?

759
01:31:09,618 --> 01:31:11,256
She's writing on the wall.

760
01:31:11,378 --> 01:31:13,573
I can see that.

761
01:31:15,258 --> 01:31:17,010
It smells of croquettes.

762
01:31:19,338 --> 01:31:21,454
She called me on the intercom...

763
01:31:21,578 --> 01:31:24,251
and asked who I was and what day it was.

764
01:31:24,618 --> 01:31:27,451
When I told her
she started writing on the wall.

765
01:31:29,058 --> 01:31:31,891
I don't want her 
to take liberties with you.

766
01:31:32,498 --> 01:31:36,650
Don't unlock her room.
If there's a problem, call me.

767
01:31:37,458 --> 01:31:39,653
She reminds me of someone.

768
01:31:39,778 --> 01:31:43,293
All the women I've operated on
end up reminding you of someone.

769
01:31:43,418 --> 01:31:47,457
Yes, but her more so.
The face is the same.

770
01:31:58,218 --> 01:32:01,528
I BREATHE.
I KNOW I BREATHE.

771
01:32:13,378 --> 01:32:15,972
OPIUM HELPS ME FORGET.

772
01:32:28,418 --> 01:32:30,568
BACK TO THE PRESENT

773
01:32:35,018 --> 01:32:37,691
- What are you doing?
- Slicing a pineapple.

774
01:32:39,898 --> 01:32:42,412
Don't look at me like that.
I won't hurt you.

775
01:32:42,538 --> 01:32:44,256
I don't trust you.

776
01:32:44,578 --> 01:32:47,650
If you did, it would be much easier
for the three of us.

777
01:32:48,898 --> 01:32:50,377
Pass me the tray.

778
01:32:50,458 --> 01:32:53,370
No. I'll take it up.

779
01:32:57,698 --> 01:33:00,087
Just put it in the dumbwaiter.

780
01:33:01,418 --> 01:33:02,851
Thank you.

781
01:34:02,898 --> 01:34:04,570
Good morning.

782
01:34:10,138 --> 01:34:11,776
Breakfast.

783
01:34:15,138 --> 01:34:16,856
Thank you.

784
01:34:26,378 --> 01:34:28,175
Where's Marilia?

785
01:34:28,338 --> 01:34:30,294
In the kitchen, grumbling.

786
01:34:31,298 --> 01:34:34,495
She doesn't like anyone else
looking after you.

787
01:34:44,578 --> 01:34:46,170
Last night...

788
01:34:46,978 --> 01:34:48,775
before we went to bed...

789
01:34:48,898 --> 01:34:51,696
we talked a lot and we made a promise.

790
01:34:53,178 --> 01:34:56,329
- Or did I dream it?
- You didn't dream it.

791
01:34:58,218 --> 01:35:01,210
You promised me that
there'd be no more locked doors...

792
01:35:01,978 --> 01:35:04,492
that I could see all the TV channels...

793
01:35:05,618 --> 01:35:07,654
that I was free.

794
01:35:09,698 --> 01:35:12,610
And I promised you
that I'd never leave you.

795
01:35:13,818 --> 01:35:15,695
Don't let me down.

796
01:35:16,258 --> 01:35:18,613
It's all I have, Robert.

797
01:35:19,218 --> 01:35:21,368
Your promise and mine.

798
01:35:30,378 --> 01:35:33,017
Have you really thought
about what we're going to do?

799
01:35:34,098 --> 01:35:37,408
When we're in the streets
she could push me and run off.

800
01:35:37,498 --> 01:35:39,170
She promised not to.

801
01:35:39,258 --> 01:35:42,375
And you believe her?
You're like a child.

802
01:35:42,898 --> 01:35:46,573
You were always like that with women.
And look where it got you!

803
01:35:46,618 --> 01:35:48,131
That's enough!

804
01:35:51,058 --> 01:35:53,208
I'm sorry I took so long.

805
01:35:54,098 --> 01:35:56,976
I've put on high heels to practice.

806
01:35:57,418 --> 01:36:00,728
Buy whatever you like.
Marilia has the cards.

807
01:36:00,898 --> 01:36:02,411
Thank you.

808
01:36:17,778 --> 01:36:19,370
Come along, child!

809
01:36:25,578 --> 01:36:27,534
Have you a problem with me?

810
01:36:28,058 --> 01:36:31,209
No, but as you can see I'm very busy.

811
01:36:32,898 --> 01:36:36,129
I want to talk about the clinic.

812
01:36:36,338 --> 01:36:38,249
I told you on the phone.

813
01:36:39,098 --> 01:36:40,656
After talking to the president...

814
01:36:40,738 --> 01:36:44,094
I decided to stop using the house as a clinic.

815
01:36:45,778 --> 01:36:48,576
But if things are done carefully,
there's no reason to worry.

816
01:36:48,658 --> 01:36:50,216
It's not just that.

817
01:36:50,498 --> 01:36:54,127
I've got other plans
that don't include operating.

818
01:36:55,778 --> 01:36:59,214
If you don't want to operate,
we'll rent the clinic from you.

819
01:36:59,298 --> 01:37:02,017
I'm speaking for all the team.

820
01:37:02,138 --> 01:37:04,857
Our main patients love the isolation here.

821
01:37:04,898 --> 01:37:08,254
I said no, Fulgencio.

822
01:37:11,938 --> 01:37:14,372
And now I'd like to be alone.

823
01:37:15,458 --> 01:37:18,495
Forgive me for not seeing you out.
You know the way.

824
01:37:50,418 --> 01:37:52,329
Are you still here?

825
01:37:53,658 --> 01:37:54,852
I'm leaving now...

826
01:37:54,978 --> 01:37:58,493
but first I'd like you
to see today's paper.

827
01:38:02,618 --> 01:38:04,256
Vicente Guillen Pineiro.

828
01:38:04,378 --> 01:38:06,448
We gave him a sex change.

829
01:38:07,178 --> 01:38:10,648
He disappeared from his home
on September 10, 2006...

830
01:38:10,858 --> 01:38:11,927
as you can see.

831
01:38:12,058 --> 01:38:13,537
And?

832
01:38:14,218 --> 01:38:16,527
I was always surprised he wanted
to get a cunt...

833
01:38:16,778 --> 01:38:18,496
without hormones.

834
01:38:18,618 --> 01:38:20,529
He only wanted a cunt.

835
01:38:21,018 --> 01:38:24,294
He's much more muscular now
and he's working in L.A...

836
01:38:24,418 --> 01:38:27,774
in porn movies, and making a fortune.
What's this about?

837
01:38:31,978 --> 01:38:35,448
It says that his mother
is still searching desperately for him.

838
01:38:35,538 --> 01:38:37,608
Don't go there.

839
01:38:37,738 --> 01:38:40,047
Those documents you 
gave us were all false.

840
01:38:40,458 --> 01:38:41,368
It wouldn't be the first time...

841
01:38:41,458 --> 01:38:44,097
we accepted false documents.

842
01:38:44,218 --> 01:38:46,732
Why do you think
our clients prefer this place?

843
01:38:46,778 --> 01:38:49,576
- You know what I think?
- No, and I don't care.

844
01:38:50,218 --> 01:38:54,097
I think you kidnapped him...

845
01:38:54,178 --> 01:38:56,328
and you've been experimenting
on him in every sense.

846
01:38:56,618 --> 01:38:57,687
You told us...

847
01:38:57,778 --> 01:39:00,292
you'd tested your new skin 
on athymic mice.

848
01:39:00,378 --> 01:39:02,096
Knowing you as I do...

849
01:39:02,178 --> 01:39:05,375
I think you'd have no scruples 
about testing it on a human being.

850
01:39:05,458 --> 01:39:07,255
On Vicente, for example.

851
01:39:07,578 --> 01:39:11,332
Do you know what would happen to you...

852
01:39:11,418 --> 01:39:13,295
if the scientific community
found out you used transgenesis...

853
01:39:13,378 --> 01:39:15,334
on someone you'd kidnapped?

854
01:39:15,378 --> 01:39:17,892
I don't like threats,
they end up infecting me.

855
01:39:20,138 --> 01:39:22,572
You don't know what you're talking about.

856
01:39:25,738 --> 01:39:28,491
Get the hell out of here!

857
01:39:29,898 --> 01:39:33,527
If you're talking about me,
Dr. Roberts didn't kidnap me.

858
01:39:36,778 --> 01:39:37,688
And...

859
01:39:37,778 --> 01:39:39,655
what's that transgenesis?

860
01:39:40,978 --> 01:39:42,650
A cream?

861
01:39:44,818 --> 01:39:47,378
If I'm here it's because
I came of my own will.

862
01:39:48,578 --> 01:39:52,287
And my name isn't Vicente,
it's Vera.

863
01:39:52,618 --> 01:39:54,176
Vera Cruz!

864
01:39:55,538 --> 01:39:57,972
And I was always a woman!

865
01:40:19,178 --> 01:40:20,691
Give me a cigarette.

866
01:40:29,978 --> 01:40:31,650
Thank you.

867
01:40:31,938 --> 01:40:34,611
No, I thank you.

868
01:41:00,458 --> 01:41:02,130
Does it still hurt?

869
01:41:02,258 --> 01:41:03,771
Yes.

870
01:41:05,778 --> 01:41:07,689
Shall we do it from behind?

871
01:41:08,858 --> 01:41:11,053
Wouldn't that hurt more?

872
01:41:11,818 --> 01:41:13,490
- Wait...
- What?

873
01:41:13,578 --> 01:41:15,648
Just today I bought lubricating cream.

874
01:41:15,698 --> 01:41:18,132
- Go and get it!
- It's in my purse.

875
01:41:32,538 --> 01:41:34,608
I'm sure I put it in my new purse...

876
01:41:34,738 --> 01:41:35,853
but I can't find it.

877
01:41:35,938 --> 01:41:38,406
You must have left it downstairs.

878
01:41:38,578 --> 01:41:41,570
I'll go and get it.

879
01:42:13,858 --> 01:42:16,975
Vera!
Hurry up!

880
01:42:28,658 --> 01:42:31,616
At last! 
I thought you'd gone.

881
01:42:34,018 --> 01:42:35,451
Not yet.

882
01:42:41,138 --> 01:42:42,457
Come on...

883
01:42:44,218 --> 01:42:45,776
What are you doing?

884
01:42:48,298 --> 01:42:50,050
I'm going to kill you.

885
01:42:50,498 --> 01:42:52,090
This is a joke, right?

886
01:42:52,938 --> 01:42:54,610
Call it what you want.

887
01:42:56,058 --> 01:42:57,935
But you promised!

888
01:42:58,058 --> 01:42:59,855
I lied.

889
01:43:37,658 --> 01:43:39,057
Robert?

890
01:43:40,938 --> 01:43:42,337
Robert?

891
01:43:42,458 --> 01:43:43,937
He's asleep.

892
01:43:45,178 --> 01:43:46,850
I heard a noise.

893
01:43:47,098 --> 01:43:48,577
Yes, so did I.

894
01:43:48,938 --> 01:43:51,611
Go back to bed,
it was nothing.

895
01:43:58,018 --> 01:43:59,531
Robert!

896
01:44:00,418 --> 01:44:02,010
My son!

897
01:44:12,618 --> 01:44:15,769
Come out of there! Bitch!

898
01:44:17,618 --> 01:44:19,370
Where are you?

899
01:44:33,938 --> 01:44:35,894
I knew it.

900
01:46:30,298 --> 01:46:31,856
Hello.

901
01:46:41,258 --> 01:46:43,169
You see to her.

902
01:46:45,298 --> 01:46:46,811
Good morning.

903
01:46:59,138 --> 01:47:00,890
What did you want?

904
01:47:02,698 --> 01:47:04,654
Is anything wrong?

905
01:47:05,698 --> 01:47:07,689
Are you all right?

906
01:47:11,378 --> 01:47:14,017
I don't know where to begin, Cristina.

907
01:47:16,018 --> 01:47:17,895
Do you know me?

908
01:47:18,698 --> 01:47:22,373
I'm Vicente.
I've just escaped.

909
01:47:23,378 --> 01:47:26,734
I was kidnapped.
They gave me a sex change.

910
01:47:29,058 --> 01:47:32,016
I had to kill two people to get away.

911
01:47:33,978 --> 01:47:36,048
You have to help me.

912
01:47:40,778 --> 01:47:42,416
Look.

913
01:47:43,098 --> 01:47:45,054
Do you remember this dress?

914
01:47:47,258 --> 01:47:51,171
Before Casilda's wedding,
six years ago...

915
01:47:51,498 --> 01:47:53,534
I said I'd give it to you...

916
01:47:53,938 --> 01:47:56,372
just to see how it looked.

917
01:47:56,458 --> 01:48:00,656
You said if I liked it so much,
I should wear it myself.

918
01:48:02,618 --> 01:48:07,248
At that moment we were alone, remember?

919
01:48:14,218 --> 01:48:16,209
Is anything wrong?

920
01:48:18,298 --> 01:48:20,653
Come here a moment, ma'am.

921
01:48:33,378 --> 01:48:35,972
Why are you crying?

922
01:48:46,698 --> 01:48:48,973
I'm Vicente.
