<i> Hello America </ i>

2
00:00:25,854 --> 00:00:28,423
<i> I wish I could tell you that this was still America </ i>

3
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:32,026
<i> But I've come to realize that you can't have a country without people </ i>

4
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,585
<i> And there there are no people here. </ i>

5
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:47,139
Stop!

6
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:56,565
<i> No my friends, this is now the United States of Zombieland! </ i>

7
00:01:01,197 --> 00:01:04,996
<i> It's amazing how quickly things can go from bad to total shitstorm. </ i>

8
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,731
<i> And why am I alive, when everyone around me has turned to meat? </ i>

9
00:01:09,495 --> 00:01:11,236
<i> It's because of my list of rules. </ i>

10
00:01:12,334 --> 00:01:14,287
<i> Rule No. 1 for surviving Zombieland: </ i>

11
00:01:14,715 --> 00:01:16,016
Cardio <i> </ i>

12
00:01:17,905 --> 00:01:23,340
<i> When the virus struck, for obvious reasons, the first ones to go were the fatties. </ i>

13
00:01:27,548 --> 00:01:29,324
<i> Poor fat bastard. </ i>

14
00:01:30,956 --> 00:01:33,318
<i> But as the infection spread and the chaos grew,  </ i>

15
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,553
<i> it wasn't enough to just be fast on your feet. </ i>

16
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,367
<i> You had to get a gun and learn how to use it. </ i>

17
00:01:40,195 --> 00:01:41,742
<i> Which leads me to my Second Rule: </ i>

18
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:43,478
<i> The double tap. </ i>

19
00:01:45,018 --> 00:01:48,199
<i> In those moments, when you're not sure the undead are really dead-dead, </ i>

20
00:01:48,465 --> 00:01:50,078
<i> don't get all stingy with you're bullets. </ i>

21
00:01:50,247 --> 00:01:52,630
<i> I mean, one more clean shot to the head </ i>

22
00:01:55,427 --> 00:01:57,818
<i> and this lady could have avoided becoming a human Happy Meal. </ i>

23
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,636
<i> Would've, could've, should've. </ i>

24
00:02:02,061 --> 00:02:04,215
<i> It wasn't long before the zombies began to get clever. </ i>

25
00:02:04,508 --> 00:02:06,236
<i> When you're at your most vulnerable, </ i>

26
00:02:06,538 --> 00:02:07,740
<i> somehow they could just smell it. </ i>

27
00:02:07,917 --> 00:02:10,200
Can't a guy take a dump here in peace?

28
00:02:17,396 --> 00:02:19,395
<i> Don't let them catch you with your pants down! Rule No. 3: </ i>

29
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,027
<i> Beware of bathrooms. </ i>

30
00:02:23,315 --> 00:02:25,156
<i> As zombies began to outnumber humans, </ i>

31
00:02:25,417 --> 00:02:28,174
<i> that's when you had to cut
all emotional ties. </ i>

32
00:02:28,714 --> 00:02:31,398
<i> If the girls in your neighborhood are now fucked up little monsters,  </ i>

33
00:02:33,898 --> 00:02:36,404
<i> well maybe it's time to stop driving carpool . </ i>

34
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:43,735
<i> You had to focus on
your own survival. </ i>

35
00:02:43,902 --> 00:02:46,003
<i> Which leads to Rule No. 4, </ i>

36
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,171
<i> pretty basic: </ i>

37
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:55,499
<i> Fasten your seat belts, </ i>

38
00:02:56,351 --> 00:02:57,764
<i> it's gonna be a bumpy ride. </ i>

39
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:42,092
<i> That guy down there is me. </ i>

40
00:04:42,894 --> 00:04:46,983
<i> I'm in Garlind, Texas, and it may look like zombies destroyed it, but that's actually just Garlind. </ i>

<i> Months since patient zero took </ i>

42
00:04:49,044 --> 00:04:51,540
<i> a bite of a contaminated burger at a Gas 'N Gulp. </ i>

43
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:55,713
<i> Just two months and i might be the last non-cannibal freak in the country. </ i>

44
00:04:56,804 --> 00:05:01,597
<i> I may seem like an unlikely survivor with all my phobias and irritable bowel syndrome. </ i>

45
00:05:01,876 --> 00:05:05,470
<i> But I had the advantage of never having any friends or any close family. </ i>

46
00:05:06,585 --> 00:05:09,651
<i> I survive, because I play it safe and follow the rules. </ i>

47
00:05:09,922 --> 00:05:11,331
<i> My rules. </ i>

48
00:05:29,265 --> 00:05:30,819
Rule No. 1

Rule No. 2
Double tap

55
00:06:47,184 --> 00:06:50,351
<i> On the bright side, I found a place to go number two. </ i>

56
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:58,576
<i> Another rule to surviving Zombieland: Travel light. </ i>

57
00:06:58,722 --> 00:07:00,897
<i> And I don't mean just luggage. </ i>

58
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,665
<i> I've always been kind of a loner. </ i>

59
00:07:03,084 --> 00:07:06,441
<i> I avoided people like they were zombies even before they were zombies. </ i>

60
00:07:06,887 --> 00:07:08,372
<i> Now that they are all zombies, </ i>

61
00:07:09,077 --> 00:07:10,371
<i> I kind of miss people. </ i>

62
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:14,822
<i> So I'm on my from my college dorm in Austin, Texas to Columbus, Ohio. </ i>

63
00:07:15,196 --> 00:07:17,543
<i> Where I'm hoping my parents are still alive. </ i>

64
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:19,678
<i> Even though we were never really close. </ i>

65
00:07:19,887 --> 00:07:21,617
<i> It would just be nice to see a familiar face, </ i>

66
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:25,221
<i> or any face, that hasn't blood dripping from it's lips and flesh between it's teeth. </ i>

67
00:08:51,789 --> 00:08:52,562
Thank you.

68
00:08:59,682 --> 00:09:00,596
- What are you looking for?

69
00:09:00,605 --> 00:09:02,209
- Nothing I just.. I have this list.

70
00:09:02,558 --> 00:09:04,593
- No one back there with my duffel bag.

71
00:09:08,221 --> 00:09:11,818
-What's your name?
-Stop. No names.

72
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:13,355
Keeps us from getting too familiar.

73
00:09:15,276 --> 00:09:17,676
- You must knock over your alcohol with your knife. 

74
00:09:19,452 --> 00:09:22,834
- That's okay, you don't have to..
- Well, where are you headed?

75
00:09:24,081 --> 00:09:25,532
- Columbus, you?

76
00:09:27,165 --> 00:09:28,508
- Tallahassee.

77
00:09:31,657 --> 00:09:35,610
- More?
- No. One for me. One and done, I always say.. I said that once.

78
00:09:37,252 --> 00:09:40,556
You know, Tallahassee and Columbus are both..

79
00:09:41,368 --> 00:09:42,749
East.
- So?

80
00:09:44,241 --> 00:09:48,068
So, Tallahasse, you wanna stick together?
At least for a while?

81
00:09:48,165 --> 00:09:50,157
- Here's the deal, Columbus.

82
00:09:51,435 --> 00:09:55,319
I'm not easy to get along with and I'm sensing you're a bit of a bitch,

83
00:09:56,871 --> 00:09:59,934
So I give this relationship to.. about Texarkana.

84
00:10:00,026 --> 00:10:02,067
- Really? Yeah. Well take me as far as Texarkana.

85
00:10:03,028 --> 00:10:05,140
You're a peppy little spit fuck, aren't you?

86
00:10:06,965 --> 00:10:08,788
- You might wanna buckle up, you know, for safety.

87
00:10:08,885 --> 00:10:11,765
- I can tell already, you are gonna get on my nerves.

88
00:10:14,122 --> 00:10:15,704
<i> Even though teaming up wasn't my style, </ i>

89
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:17,817
<i> I figured I'd be
safer with Tallahassee. </ i>

90
00:10:18,512 --> 00:10:22,121
<i> You see he was in the ass-kicking business, and.. </ I>
- Business is good.

91
00:10:24,042 --> 00:10:26,730
<i> It became quickly apparent, however, that he did have one weakness. </ i>

92
00:10:28,471 --> 00:10:29,437
- What are we doing here?

93
00:10:29,438 --> 00:10:31,550
- We're taking a look, it's a Goddamn Hostess truck.

94
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:34,430
- Yeah I see that. A Hostess truck. So what?

95
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:37,119
- I could use a Twinkie.

96
00:10:42,857 --> 00:10:46,123
- Are you coming?
- Yes.. Yeah, one second.

97
00:10:51,092 --> 00:10:53,487
- Are you fuckin' with me?
- No

98
00:10:53,628 --> 00:10:55,714
You should actually limber up as well.

99
00:10:56,011 --> 00:10:59,605
Especially if we're going down that hill,
is very important.

100
00:11:00,404 --> 00:11:04,973
- I don't believe in it. Have you ever seen a lion limber up before it takes down a gazelle?

101
00:11:28,972 --> 00:11:30,796
Snowballs.
-Yeah.

102
00:11:31,181 --> 00:11:32,141
Snowballs!

103
00:11:33,383 --> 00:11:36,224
Where's the fucking twinkies?

104
00:11:36,975 --> 00:11:38,076
- I like snowballs.

105
00:11:38,815 --> 00:11:41,859
- I hate coconut, not the taste, the consistency.

106
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,820
- Fresh.

107
00:11:45,886 --> 00:11:48,574
- Well this Twinkie thing, it ain't over yet.

108
00:11:52,815 --> 00:11:56,598
- Hey! If were being back I'm about.. I just take the browns to the Superbowl.

109
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:58,175
- Really?
- Really.

110
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:11,178
<i> I know.. "Again?! So soon?" What can I say, I have a case of chronic anxiety. </ i>

111
00:12:14,588 --> 00:12:16,448
<i> I was always kind of phobic. </ i>

112
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:19,172
<i> I found lots of things disturbing. </ i>

113
00:12:19,173 --> 00:12:22,053
<i> Like Undertow, or department store Santas. </ i>

114
00:12:22,216 --> 00:12:24,110
<i> Being alone with a baby. </ i>

115
00:12:26,025 --> 00:12:28,992
<i> But the thing I fear more than anything, yes, even more than zombies, </ i>

116
00:12:31,439 --> 00:12:32,734
<i> fucking clowns. </ i>

117
00:12:35,614 --> 00:12:37,532
<i> When you are afraid of everything that's out there, </ i>

118
00:12:38,218 --> 00:12:39,748
<i> you quit going out there. </ i>

119
00:12:40,524 --> 00:12:42,706
<i> Which is what happened to me before Zombieland. </ i>

120
00:12:43,024 --> 00:12:46,245
<i> Friday night, third straight week indoors, </ i>

121
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,572
<i> World Of Warcraft, </ i>

<i> "Code Red Mountain Dew", </ i>

00:12:52,300 --> 00:13:01,053
<i> pride: nowhere, dignity: long gone, virginity: totally justifiable to speculate on. </ i> - Smooth

124
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04, 500
<i> My whole life, all I'd ever wanted was to find a girl. </ i>

125
00:13:04,733 --> 00:13:07,618
<i> And fall in love.
Bring her home to meet the folks. </ i>

126
00:13:07,702 --> 00:13:10,682
<i> Then again, since my folks are a couple of paranoid shut-ins like me, </ i>

127
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:13,336
<i> maybe this girl could bring me home to her folks. </ i>

128
00:13:13,613 --> 00:13:16,513
<i> And the I'd finally be a member of a cool functional family. </ i>

129
00:13:20,001 --> 00:13:22,576
Please! Anyone home?
Please, it's an emergency!

130
00:13:23,246 --> 00:13:25,894
<i> I don't usually unlock my door to the sounds of panic, </ i>

131
00:13:25,895 --> 00:13:28,870
<i> but my neighbor of 406 is insanely hot. </ i> - Okay, Okay.

132
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:35,385
Thank you, thank you..

133
00:13:37,018 --> 00:13:38,266
- Nice to meet you.

134
00:13:43,285 --> 00:13:44,397
Here

135
00:13:45,454 --> 00:13:46,414
Here you go.

136
00:13:52,175 --> 00:13:55,055
- Mountain Dew? 
- Yeah, Code Red. And here is some Gold Grams.

137
00:13:55,728 --> 00:13:57,551
The Ziplock bag keep's 'em crisp.

138
00:14:01,137 --> 00:14:02,903
So.. tell me what happened?

139
00:14:04,415 --> 00:14:07,737
- He was homeless and.. sick.

140
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,759
And I was walking home from the bar  talking on my phone,

141
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,216
and then.. he just came sprinting towards me.

142
00:14:15,434 --> 00:14:19,453
I mean not running, sprinting.

143
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,012
And then I thought, like, maybe he was running from someone, or after them. 

143
00:24:19,960 --> 00:14:27,012
The last time I saw him he was still out there going crazy.

144
00:14:28,195 --> 00:14:29,454
- Drugs maybe..

145
00:14:31,576 --> 00:14:33,947
- I didn't even tell you the worst part.

146
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,076
- Yeah?
- He tried to bite me.

147
00:14:40,106 --> 00:14:41,532
- You are right, that's the worst part.

148
00:14:42,386 --> 00:14:45,117
- Sorry, I'm just so scared.

149
00:14:45,966 --> 00:14:50,179
- No, no.. you should be scared. A homeless man just tried to eat you.

150
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:54,020
that's like the right ind of scared. That's reasonable scared. You know I get scared for things that like, don't make sense at all.

151
00:14:54,203 --> 00:14:56,411
like clowns with red noses,

152
00:14:56,412 --> 00:15:00,252
or like the rags they use to wipe down tables when you finish eating, like a chain restaurant. 

153
00:15:00,342 --> 00:15:01,715
- Really?

154
00:15:02,132 --> 00:15:05,098
- The point is, I'm here for you.
Ok?

155
00:15:06,051 --> 00:15:08,612
And as long as you're by my side, 
I am not leaving this apartment

156
00:15:12,133 --> 00:15:13,675
- Do you mind if I just close my eyes for a minute?
- No, of course..

157
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,381
- Thank you.

158
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:21,155
<i> Set aside the feverish, homeless cannibal,
I'm living the dream. </ i>

159
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:26,833
<i> I had always, my whole life, wanted to brush a girls hair over her ear. </ i>

160
00:15:28,272 --> 00:15:29,575
-Good night.
-Good night.

161
00:15:44,582 --> 00:15:45,543
Oh my God!

162
00:15:47,255 --> 00:15:48,280
Are you okay?

163
00:15:53,426 --> 00:15:55,232
Ok, ok.. stop..

164
00:15:55,905 --> 00:15:57,153
What are you doing?

165
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,640
Look, stay back 406, ok? I don't wanna hurt you, but..

166
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:08,273
Oh, shit.

167
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,297
Oh my God I am so fucking sorry.

Double Strike

<i> That was my first brush with the plague of the 21st century </ i>

- Alright, you steer, I'll push.
- Okay.

179
00:18:12,882 --> 00:18:15,762
There's a place that is untouched by all this crap.

180
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,642
- Back east, yeah?
- Yeah, you heard the same thing?

181
00:18:18,835 --> 00:18:22,483
- Out west we hear it's back east, back east they hear it's out west.

182
00:18:23,011 --> 00:18:25,184
It's all just nonsense.

183
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:30,957
You know, you're like a penguin on the North Pole, hears the South Pole is really nice this time 'a year.

184
00:18:31,866 --> 00:18:33,584
- There are no penguins on the North Pole.

185
00:18:35,584 --> 00:18:37,865
- You wanna feel how hard I can punch?

186
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:40,888
So what do you think?

187
00:18:40,889 --> 00:18:43,769
Wait, the last time I laid some pipe?

188
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:45,690
The last time you went twenty toes,

189
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:51,450
the percy in the playpen, wallpapered the closet, passed the gravy. Went heels to Jesus.

190
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:55,941
- Oh, made love.
- Well, just, sex.

191
00:18:59,241 --> 00:19:02,535
Three weeks ago, yeah. In the back of an abandoned FedEx truck.

192
00:19:02,536 --> 00:19:05,416
- Shut up ....

193
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:08,808
No, no, I was headed east, she west.

194
00:19:09,651 --> 00:19:13,306
And we took shelter in the back of the truck.
Was full of undelivered packages.

195
00:19:13,307 --> 00:19:14,267
- What was her name?

196
00:19:15,132 --> 00:19:16,092
- Beverly,

197
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:17,149
Beverly Hills

198
00:19:17,726 --> 00:19:18,781
- You dog.

199
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:23,582
- So, what about you?

200
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,463
Me?, I..

201
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,521
Oh my God.

202
00:19:33,885 --> 00:19:35,263
It makes you sick.

203
00:19:35,264 --> 00:19:37,184
Kind'a makes you sad, it makes you,

204
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,984
makes you think if you could go back,
to the way things were right now, you know,

205
00:19:42,561 --> 00:19:45,921
you'd be out in the back yard, you know, try to catch fireflies.

206
00:19:46,882 --> 00:19:48,610
And instead, this.

207
00:19:51,475 --> 00:19:53,733
- I mean it makes you..
- Hungry.

208
00:19:54,328 --> 00:19:56,032
- I'm worried about you.

209
00:19:56,476 --> 00:19:58,864
- Look, whatever you have waitin' for you in Columbus,

210
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:03,184
I'll promise it ain't any prettier than our friend here enjoying her man-which.

211
00:20:10,421 --> 00:20:13,283
<i> Tallahassee had a sick sense of humor when it came to zombies </ i>

221
00:20:40,675 --> 00:20:41,982
You're a dangerous man.

222
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:45,277
You're gonna risk our lives for a Twinkie?

223
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:49,340
- There is a box of Twinkies
in that grocery store,

not just any box of Twinkies,

The last box of Twinkies that anyone will enjoy in the whole universe.

226
00:20:56,235 --> 00:20:58,907
Believe it or not, Twinkies
have an expiration date.

227
00:20:59,388 --> 00:21:004,732
Someday very soon, life's little twinkle gage is gonna go empty.

228
00:21:06,715 --> 00:21:08,627

- So you did all this for a Twinkie?

254
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:31,953
Oh, no, no.. he did. I'm just kind of like a Sancho Panza character.

255

- Look, I don't think she has long.
- I know, I know.

- your sister wants me to..
- It's not her decision, okay, It's mine.

261
00:24:00,067 --> 00:24:01,794
I made a promise

262
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:05,741
We already said goodbye, but we didn't have a gun.

263
00:24:06,036 --> 00:24:09,232
- We don't know that there's definitely no cure, right, I mean..
- You're just gut-less!

264
00:24:10,552 --> 00:24:11,869
Give him the gun.

265
00:24:28,188 --> 00:24:30,237

We'll take your weapons, your car keys, your ammunition.

271

- Relax ok, I just passed for a zombie.

281

- Do not say s-h-o-w-e-r, okay.

Let's just get where we're going.

- So do you think it's true?
- Is what true?

284
00:26:00,045 --> 00:26:01,389
- [rumors] about Pacific Playland.

285

00:26:41,618 --> 00:26:43,249
- Yeah I always roll it up from the bottom.
- Yeah

297
00:26:44,018 --> 00:26:45,650
Zombies head is the cap.

298
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:49,124
- Wait are you one of these guys that tries to, like, wonder if everybody else has a story?

- No.

00:26:50,949 --> 00:26:52,677
I know a guy way worse at that than me.

301

Oh, I  think I pulled something.

You hesitated.

Come on, why don't we just forget about those girls and head home.

328
00:29:28,014 --> 00:29:30,408
- Oh you wanna talk about home.

329
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:34,196
For me home, was a puppy named Buck,

330
00:29:35,445 --> 00:29:36,885
cutest dog ever.

331
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:47,030
All those fucking zombies.

332
00:29:48,061 --> 00:29:49,588
I lost him.

333
00:29:49,865 --> 00:29:52,070
There ain't no getting him back, so

334
00:29:53,074 --> 00:29:54,985
I am looking for a new home.

335
00:29:55,708 --> 00:29:57,681
Tomorrow maybe,

336
00:29:57,874 --> 00:30:00,562
skinny dipping in the Yellowstone River,

337
00:30:01,523 --> 00:30:04,403
swing from the chandeliers in the Playboy Mansion, but today,

338
00:30:04,404 --> 00:30:06,324
a vortex six fucking liter V8,

339
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:11,700
a box full of ...
and Lord willin', a GD Twinkie.

340
00:30:13,232 --> 00:30:15,414
Gotta enjoy the little things.

341
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:20,284
<i> I hate to give credit to anyone who looks like your Samity Sam, </ i>

342
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:21,725
<i> but I'm writing it down. </ i>

343
00:30:22,335 --> 00:30:25,304
<i> Rule No. 32
Enjoy the little things </ i>

344
00:30:31,795 --> 00:30:34,817
- Going in, it's a trap.
345
00:30:34,809 --> 00:30:36,187
Wait here.

346
00:30:36,188 --> 00:30:37,148
Drive down if I signal.

347
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,856
- You're not gonna shoot them, are you?

348
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:42,087
- Unless the shoot me.

349
00:30:43,624 --> 00:30:45,352
Oh, let's hope they shoot me.

350
00:31:34,635 --> 00:31:36,040
Looks like they hoofed it.
351
00:31:37,207 --> 00:31:38,579
Probably headed west.

352
00:31:39,609 --> 00:31:41,777
Just drive slow, keep your eyes peeled.

353
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:47,920
They're in the back, aren't they?

354
00:31:48,238 --> 00:31:49,799
- Just me.

355
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,544
- I'm really sorry. She was like a crouching tiger.

356
00:31:53,669 --> 00:31:56,431
- You got taken hostage by a twelve year old?

357
00:31:56,717 --> 00:31:58,455
Well, girls mature faster than boys.

358
00:31:58,456 --> 00:32:00,472
She is way ahead of where I was at that age.

359
00:32:00,487 --> 00:32:02,953
- Twelve's the new twenty. Gun please.

360
00:32:03,722 --> 00:32:05,642
- Like you would ever use it..

361
00:32:05,643 --> 00:32:08,235
Don't kill me with my own gun.

362
00:32:08,605 --> 00:32:10,589
- All those violent video games.

363
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,933
- Thank you.

364
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,179
Now honk your horn.
- What?

365
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,140
- Honk it.

366
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,860
- Oh, there's your sister, that's my gun.

367
00:32:21,861 --> 00:32:22,821
Hello.

367
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,821
- Bummer.

368
00:32:29,472 --> 00:32:32,355
Now step away from the vehicle. 

368
00:32:33,472 --> 00:32:35,355
You get to ride shotgun

369
00:32:43,303 --> 00:32:44,578
<i> I kinda like this girl. </ i>

370
00:32:44,925 --> 00:32:47,245
<i> She's not your typical hot, stuck up bitch. </ i>

371
00:32:49,046 --> 00:32:52,079
<i> Even before Zombieland, Wichita was running the table on guys like us. </ i>

372
00:33:07,074 --> 00:33:08,166
- What are you looking for?

373
00:33:07,842 --> 00:33:09,706
- My engagement ring.

374
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:15,163
- I took it off to pump my gas and I thought I had it in my purse,

375
00:33:15,164 --> 00:33:16,604
but it must've fallen out.

376
00:33:16,726 --> 00:33:18,819
And I'm late for my flight..

377
00:33:18,821 --> 00:33:21,809
- Listen, I'll find your ring and I'll FedEx it to you.

378
00:33:22,386 --> 00:33:23,730
- I'll give you a reward

379
00:33:24,307 --> 00:33:25,267
- Do not be silly.

380
00:33:25,268 --> 00:33:26,228
- Three-thousand dollars.

381
00:33:26,775 --> 00:33:29,481
It's worth more than my car.

382
00:33:30,432 --> 00:33:32,020
- Just, just give me your number.

383
00:33:34,087 --> 00:33:35,210
I'll find it.

384
00:33:35,403 --> 00:33:37,323
Yeah I'll start looking for it right now.

385
00:33:37,324 --> 00:33:38,764
Cause I got nothing else to do.

386
00:33:39,999 --> 00:33:41,950
I was engaged once,

387
00:33:41,951 --> 00:33:43,391
but I'm single now.

388
00:33:46,407 --> 00:33:47,743
Bye

389
00:33:50,432 --> 00:33:51,872
Hope you make your flight.

390
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:02,172
I know it's around here somewhere, she's on a plane, that's the beauty of it.

391
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,115
Let me call you back.

392
00:34:07,663 --> 00:34:09,450
Hey, you found my ring.

393
00:34:10,903 --> 00:34:13,022
Thanks, I've been looking all over for it.

394
00:34:12,964 --> 00:34:14,705
- Your ring?
- It was my friend's.

395
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:17,851
I'm gonna send it to her.
- Do I get a reward?

396
00:34:19,734 --> 00:34:25,032
- 40, 60, 80,
400, That's it. That's the whole register.

397
00:34:28,231 --> 00:34:30,379
You made someone very happy.

398
00:34:31,191 --> 00:34:32,295
- You too.

399
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:45,071
- How many left?
- Let me see.

400
00:34:47,951 --> 00:34:50,159
Enough for us to get to California.

401
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,040
Someday I want a ring this big.

402
00:34:52,561 --> 00:34:55,441
- For the low price of 30 bucks, sold.

403
00:34:57,578 --> 00:35:01,267
<i> It's amazing how far you can get with some costume jewelry and a cut-throat attitude. </ i>

404
00:35:02,161 --> 00:35:04,924
<i> I guess we're just lucky they didn't leave us by the side of the road. </ i>

405
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:09,752
- Thank you Wichita,
Thanks Little Rock.

406
00:35:14,638 --> 00:35:17,410
- Hey for fuck's sake, enough already, we're being chased by ravenous freaks.

407
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,724
We don't have enough problems?

408
00:35:19,725 --> 00:35:22,125
"Oh, they stole my Hummer", "We have trust issues".

409
00:35:22,126 --> 00:35:25,198
Now get over it, okay, we can't just fucking drive down the road playing I-spy,

410
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:27,887
or some shit for two hours, like four normal-ass Americans?

411
00:35:27,888 --> 00:35:29,232
Fuck me!

412
00:35:30,533 --> 00:35:31,753
I know

413
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,594
Let me be the mature one.

414
00:35:48,727 --> 00:35:49,860
- So

415
00:35:50,132 --> 00:35:51,239
Where are you guys headed.

416
00:35:51,748 --> 00:35:53,325
- "Pacific Play Land"

417
00:35:54,094 --> 00:35:55,054
- The amusement park?

418
00:35:55,055 --> 00:35:56,207
- Wait, outside LA?

419
00:35:56,605 --> 00:35:57,932
- Yeah, we went there as kids.

420
00:35:59,007 --> 00:36:00,838
- That place totally blows..

421
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:07,761
my mind. It's so fun. Just good entertainment for the whole family.

422
00:36:08,085 --> 00:36:12,057
- Yeah actually I went there as a kid too. In fact this probably counts as off season.

423
00:36:12,357 --> 00:36:15,041
- Well, did you guys hear?
There are no zombies there

424
00:36:15,042 --> 00:36:16,194
- Yeah, we heard.

425
00:36:16,195 --> 00:36:18,019
You know what, I may not shoot you,

426
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:21,187
but you still royally piss me off.

427
00:36:21,188 --> 00:36:24,452
And I'm not going to play with you at Pacific Playland.

428
00:36:26,313 --> 00:36:29,244
- Don't worry he grows on you.
- Really?

429
00:36:29,341 --> 00:36:31,453
- No, it's worse.
- Okay.

430
00:36:30,885 --> 00:36:33,263
How about we play the quiet game?

431
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,871
Yeah? Starting now.

432
00:36:37,496 --> 00:36:41,837
- Oh, I've actually been meaning to ask you. Did you hear anything about Columbus, Ohio?

433
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:43,757
- You've heard of the quiet game?
- Sorry.

434
00:36:43,765 --> 00:36:45,911
No? Well they're playing it in Columbus, ohio.

435
00:36:45,959 --> 00:36:48,543
It's a total ghost town, burned to the ground.

436
00:36:57,855 --> 00:36:59,103
- You're Columbus.

437
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,600
I'm sorry.

438
00:37:01,985 --> 00:37:03,329
I didn't realize it was..

439
00:37:05,165 --> 00:37:06,808
<i> I'm not sure what's more tragic, </ i>

440
00:37:07,206 --> 00:37:08,618
<i> That my family is gone, </ i>

441
00:37:08,619 --> 00:37:12,267
<i> or the realization that I had never much of a family to begin with. </ i>

442
00:37:12,287 --> 00:37:14,339
<i> Either way I can't pretend that whatever I'm looking for, </ i>

443
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,972
<i> I'll find by going home. </ i>

444
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,631
<i> I have no home. </ i>

445
00:37:20,317 --> 00:37:21,314
- We can,

446
00:37:22,179 --> 00:37:24,675
give you a ride.

447
00:37:25,279 --> 00:37:28,490
You can go, see for yourself, or settle somewhere new.

448
00:37:33,758 --> 00:37:36,207
<i> I could tell she knew what I was feeling. </ i>

449
00:37:36,207 --> 00:37:38,607
<i> We are all orphans in Zombieland. </ i>

450
00:37:51,759 --> 00:37:54,351
I know this Pacific Playland thing is nuts,

451
00:37:55,216 --> 00:37:56,752
but,

452
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:59,633
it's been so long since she got to be a kid.

453
00:38:01,129 --> 00:38:03,205
- It's tough growing up in Zombieland.
- It's tough growing up.

454
00:38:12,037 --> 00:38:14,149
There, you can take that truck.

455
00:38:18,758 --> 00:38:20,870
Well, I,

456
00:38:21,047 --> 00:38:23,505
hope you find whoever it is you're looking for.

457
00:38:25,115 --> 00:38:28,148
And don't let go, once you do.

458
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,248
<i> It wasn't just because i had nowhere else to go. </ i>

459
00:38:44,097 --> 00:38:46,439
<i> It was cause in that moment it became clear. </ i>

460
00:38:47,537 --> 00:38:48,960
<i> Wherever this girl was,</ i>

461
00:38:49,703 --> 00:38:51,287
<i>  that's where i wanted to be.  </ i>

462
00:39:09,527 --> 00:39:13,367
- Man we're gonna have to pull over soon.
I'm feeling cooped up.

463
00:39:14,328 --> 00:39:17,399
Wantamiro Wampum, Yeah that'll work.

464
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,128
- Okay but what the hell are we doing?

465
00:39:19,321 --> 00:39:21,433
- Just humor him, trust me.

466
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,279
- Hold on.
- Who wants to go first?

467
00:39:38,144 --> 00:39:40,448
<i> I really, really wanna impress Wichita, </ i>

468
00:39:41,696 --> 00:39:45,152
<i> but it would be a direct violation of Rule 17,
maybe the most important of all, </ i>

469
00:39:45,153 --> 00:39:47,073
<i> Don't be hero. </ i>

470
00:39:47,075 --> 00:39:48,620
- Why don't you take this one.

471
00:39:48,716 --> 00:39:50,060
- Don't mind if I do.

472
00:40:04,351 --> 00:40:07,065
What do you think? Zombie kill of the week?

473
00:40:07,157 --> 00:40:08,882
<i> Close, but no cigar. </ i>

474
00:40:09,332 --> 00:40:12,620
<i> Zombie kill of the week goes to sister Cynthia Knickerbocker. </ i>

475
00:40:17,819 --> 00:40:19,374
<i> Poor flat bastard. </ i>

476
00:40:40,373 --> 00:40:41,774
- Perfume?
- What?

477
00:40:42,522 --> 00:40:43,927
- Is that perfume?

478
00:40:45,704 --> 00:40:47,147
- It's cologne.

479
00:40:47,396 --> 00:40:49,193
- I'm thinking:

480
00:40:49,194 --> 00:40:51,017
"Lanco Magnifique"

481
00:40:51,018 --> 00:40:53,898
- Why don't you speak up, they might've missed it in Santa fe.

482
00:41:01,699 --> 00:41:03,948
- Oh my God. You're thinking about fucking Wichita.

483
00:41:05,058 --> 00:41:08,411
Wish granted. She spent the last 24 hours fucking us both.

484
00:41:11,901 --> 00:41:14,843
Good luck now Petunia.

485
00:41:22,587 --> 00:41:27,659
- Ok, let me begin my three-part apology by saying that I think you're a wonderful human with great potential..

485
00:41:27,587 --> 00:41:32:059
- Fyi: I beat wholesale ass for a lot less than that.

486
00:41:32,409 --> 00:41:37,034
- I'm sure
- You get 45% power.
- Thank you.

487
00:41:40,254 --> 00:41:41,693
Come on, break another one.

488
00:41:46,011 --> 00:41:46,707
Nice!

489
00:41:50,773 --> 00:41:52,244
Doesn't that feel good.

490
00:42:39,378 --> 00:42:42,642
<i> Sometimes Tallahassee's right. You gotta enjoy the little things. </ i>

491
00:42:42,778 --> 00:42:45,469
<i> Even if that means destroying a whole lot of little things. </ i>

492
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:51,038
- What smells like perfume?

493
00:42:54,302 --> 00:42:56,318
- You don't know who Willie Nelson is?
- No.

494
00:42:58,143 --> 00:43:01,503
- Willie Nelson.
- Yeah, no, I don't.

495
00:43:02,272 --> 00:43:03,328
- Yeah I shave every mooring but sometimes

496
00:43:03,329 --> 00:43:09,088
by like 4:30 I have a thing..[rambling]

497
00:43:09,089 --> 00:43:13,217
- Since this is a freeway. You can get it up to 65, but you don't wanna go more than 75.

498
00:43:13,733 --> 00:43:14,936
- You don't wanna go more than 20.

499
00:43:15,554 --> 00:43:21,076
- Do not worry about it. Blind spots, blind spots are for other drivers.

500
00:43:22,037 --> 00:43:26,957
- So do you never strap in or just, when on road trips?
- It's just, you know,

501
00:43:27,681 --> 00:43:30,743
there's zombies everywhere. I think the least of my worries is..

502
00:43:30,972 --> 00:43:31,654
- Yeah that's true.

503
00:43:31,655 --> 00:43:32,615
..seat belts.

504
00:43:32,921 --> 00:43:37,243
- Yes but no, she's not. She's only famous when she's Hannah Montana, when she's wearing the wig.

505
00:43:37,244 --> 00:43:38,684
-Okay, right.
-So..

506
00:43:43,677 --> 00:43:46,365
- This is kind of freeing.
- Yeah.

507
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,641
<i> For the first time in a long time, </ i>

508
00:43:51,883 --> 00:43:53,318
<i> we were having fun. </ i>

509
00:43:53,383 --> 00:43:56,103
<i> So even though it ran counter to our survival strategies, </ i>

510
00:43:56,104 --> 00:43:58,504
<i> we decided to stay together as far as Pacific Playland. </ i>

511
00:44:26,065 --> 00:44:29,510
- You know I think sleep deprivation is like the number one health problem in America.

512
00:44:30,279 --> 00:44:32,487
No, I think it moth be number two.

513
00:44:32,488 --> 00:44:35,368
- Number two..
- That's adorable.

514
00:44:35,369 --> 00:44:38,440
- I'm just saying we should find a place to crash.
- Oh, I got an idea.

515
00:44:39,113 --> 00:44:40,937
We're in Hollywood, let's sleep in style.

516
00:44:47,178 --> 00:44:48,426
Grab a map.

517
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:56,010
- Come on.
- Hurry.

518
00:45:05,446 --> 00:45:09,159
- It seems like everyone who has ever been in a movie lives on this block.

519
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,944
- What exactly do you think we're doing in the 90210 Sally?

520
00:45:12,429 --> 00:45:15,194
- I kind of pictured Tom Cruise living somewhere nicer.

521
00:45:15,195 --> 00:45:18,074
- B..lister compared to who I got in mind folks.

522
00:45:19,035 --> 00:45:21,819
We are going to the Tipi Top of the A-list.

523
00:45:22,108 --> 00:45:24,412
- Who?
- You'll see.

524
00:45:30,164 --> 00:45:32,464
- Hey, here's a big BM.

525
00:45:32,465 --> 00:45:34,193
- It ain't Bob Marley.

526
00:45:40,721 --> 00:45:42,161
- This place is incredible.

527
00:45:53,201 --> 00:45:58,961
- Ladies and Gentlemen,
welcome to La Menzion de Murray.

528
00:45:58,962 --> 00:46:00,594
- Oh, Bill Murray

529
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:01,756
- God, no way.

530
00:46:02,162 --> 00:46:05,749
This guy has a direct line to my funny bone  I mean every..

531
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:07,670
- Boy, who's Bill Murray?

532
00:46:07,671 --> 00:46:13,430
- I have never hit a kid before, but I mean that's like asking who Gandhi is.

533
00:46:14,007 --> 00:46:15,351
- Who's Gandhi?

534
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,272
- She's twelve.

535
00:46:21,113 --> 00:46:23,032
- No Twinkies.
- Shit Bob.

537
00:46:22,916 --> 00:46:26,639
- See? I told you we should've gone to Russel Crowe's. No one listens to me.

538
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,080
- Hello, inside voices, okay?


539
00:46:28,081 --> 00:46:29,521
- At least until we know we are alone.

539
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,080
- Hey Tallahassee, Wichita why don't you take that way.

540
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:33,361
Little Rock come here.

541
00:46:33,362 --> 00:46:34,802
- Why do I get stuck with her?

542
00:46:38,643 --> 00:46:39,987
- It doesn't seem to end.

543
00:46:46,035 --> 00:46:46,995
Hey come here.

544
00:46:49,204 --> 00:46:51,796
- He has his own movie theatre?

545
00:46:55,349 --> 00:46:57,461
- Ok, I'm gonna teach you a little something about Bill Murray.

546
00:46:59,669 --> 00:47:01,301
- The king slept right here.

546
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,301
- Dibs on the bed.

547
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,236
- Too soft for me anyway.

548
00:47:16,705 --> 00:47:19,645
- Oh, this is so exciting, you're about to learn who you're gonna call.

549
00:47:19,934 --> 00:47:21,182
Ghostbusters.

550
00:47:38,462 --> 00:47:41,341
- It is pretty catchy.

551
00:47:44,221 --> 00:47:48,061
Help me with the boots, come on.
Help me with the boots.

552
00:47:49,598 --> 00:47:51,230
Ok, I'll get 'em myself.

553
00:48:17,624 --> 00:48:19,174
- Bill Murray, you're a zombie?

554
00:48:27,416 --> 00:48:29,318
- You're not a zombie, you're talking.

555
00:48:29,559 --> 00:48:30,802
You're okay.

556
00:48:30,965 --> 00:48:35,908
- The hell I am.
- I'm sorry, I didn't know that it was you-you.

557
00:48:35,842 --> 00:48:38,003
- Are you..What's with the, the get up?

558
00:48:38,184 --> 00:48:42,787
Oh, I do it to blend in, you know zombies don't mess with other zombies.

559
00:48:42,788 --> 00:48:45,188
Buddy of mine, make-up guy, showed how to do this. 

560
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:48,615
Corn starch, you know some berries, a little liquish for the ladies.

561
00:48:48,627 --> 00:48:51,482
It suits my lifestyle. You know I like to get out and do stuff.

562
00:48:52,077 --> 00:48:56,053
Just played nine holes at the Riviera, just walked on, nobody there.

563
00:48:56,342 --> 00:48:59,222
- Goddamn it, Bill fucking Murray.

564
00:49:00,767 --> 00:49:02,974
I had to get that out. I don't mean to gush.

565
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:07,774
This is so surreal, I mean. You probably get this all the time,well, maybe not lately,

566
00:49:07,776 --> 00:49:09,771
but I'm such a huge fan of yours.

567
00:49:09,965 --> 00:49:13,885
I've seen everyone of your movies a million times.

568
00:49:13,886 --> 00:49:16,766
I even love your dramatic roles, everything.

569
00:49:18,976 --> 00:49:22,906
Six people left in the world, one of them is Bill fucking Murray.

570
00:49:23,625 --> 00:49:28,130
I know that's not your middle name. I've been watching you since i was like.. since I could masturbate, not that they're connected.

571
00:49:31,011 --> 00:49:32,930
You know "A former greenskeeper about to become the master champion."

572
00:49:38,653 --> 00:49:39,935
- That's why we do it.

573
00:49:40,991 --> 00:49:42,732
- I love you Bill, I love you.

574
00:49:44,354 --> 00:49:45,695
- Thank you.

575
00:49:46,185 --> 00:49:48,788
- You are staring at me, it's a hairpiece it's a..

576
00:49:48,789 --> 00:49:52,244
- Sorry, it's just that you look remarkably like Eddy Van Halen.

577
00:49:52,245 --> 00:49:53,589
- I Just saw Eddy Van Halen. 

578
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:54,934
- Really?
- Yeah.

579
00:49:55,647 --> 00:49:56,762
- Where?
- At the Hollywood bowl.

580
00:49:57,357 --> 00:49:59,138
- Well, how was it?
- He's a zombie

581
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:01,585
- That's a tough break.

582
00:50:01,616 --> 00:50:06,384
- So how about a little west coast hospitality. Can I get you something? What would you like?

582
00:50:06,616 --> 00:50:12,000
[Blue Oyster Cult - Don't Fear The Reaper]

582
00:50:17,00 --> 00:50:19,000
- Smooth, isn't it?

583
00:50:21,057 --> 00:50:24,376
- Oh hurry, hurry he's on the ceiling. Come get him. Oh..

584
00:50:25,625 --> 00:50:28,121
- Light 'em up Murray.
- See you on the other side Pete.

585
00:50:29,082 --> 00:50:30,522
- You're so disgusting.

586
00:50:32,193 --> 00:50:33,816
- Don't cross the streams.

587
00:50:34,681 --> 00:50:38,617
- I don't wanna cross..
- Don't cross the streams!

587
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,500
- "35 feet long, weighing approximately 600 pounds"
- "That's a big Twinkie"

588
00:50:45,952 --> 00:50:49,998
- Your sister's single, right? There's nothing long-distance or anything.

589
00:50:50,383 --> 00:50:52,303
- No.
- Good, good.

590
00:50:53,299 --> 00:50:58,319
And if she had, like, a type - if you can have a type - what would that be?

591
00:50:59,471 --> 00:51:01,934
- She kinda goes for, like, bad boys.

592
00:51:01,935 --> 00:51:03,087
- Really?
- Yeah.

593
00:51:03,088 --> 00:51:04,336
- That's cool.

594
00:51:08,472 --> 00:51:11,408
- So Columbus is the scared one?
- Yeah, he's like a little bunny.

595
00:51:13,288 --> 00:51:15,233
- I'll get him.

596
00:51:17,446 --> 00:51:18,527
Watch this.

597
00:51:30,047 --> 00:51:32,735
- It's okay, it's okay. I got him.

598
00:51:36,996 --> 00:51:39,581
Is that how you say hello where you come from?

599
00:51:40,832 --> 00:51:43,941
Oh my God, Oh my God I can't believe I shot Bill Murray.

600
00:51:46,117 --> 00:51:47,520
Mr. Murray?

601
00:51:47,449 --> 00:51:50,844
Just Bill I think now.

602
00:51:50,845 --> 00:51:51,997
- Bill?
- Yeah?

603
00:51:52,958 --> 00:51:56,797
- I don't think we're gonna be able to stitch this.

604
00:51:58,046 --> 00:51:59,678
- Ow, that's still tender.

605
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,523
- You think you might pull through?

606
00:52:05,203 --> 00:52:06,283
- No.

607
00:52:06,737 --> 00:52:09,044
- If it means anything now I am so sorry.

608
00:52:09,912 --> 00:52:11,217
It was just instinctive.

609
00:52:11,747 --> 00:52:12,915
- It was my bad.

610
00:52:13,133 --> 00:52:15,424
I was never a very good practical joker.

611
00:52:16,461 --> 00:52:18,696
- So do you have any regrets?

612
00:52:21,632 --> 00:52:23,662
"Garfield", maybe.

613
00:52:47,662 --> 00:52:49,966
- I'm sorry, he just gets me.

614
00:52:51,694 --> 00:52:53,422
But it still is sad.
- Yeah.

615
00:53:13,294 --> 00:53:15,694
- Sorry. One second

616
00:53:16,175 --> 00:53:17,519
-It's a double-barrel so..

617
00:53:19,055 --> 00:53:19,823
Okay.

618
00:53:25,104 --> 00:53:27,024
3,2,1

619
00:53:30,001 --> 00:53:32,785
- You guys want some caramel?
- Yes.

620
00:53:41,423 --> 00:53:42,676
- Oh Free parking, which coincidentally 

621
00:53:42,965 --> 00:53:45,461
is the best thing about Zombieland.

622
00:53:45,653 --> 00:53:48,533
- No, best thing about Z-land: No Facebook status updates.

623
00:53:48,534 --> 00:53:51,414
You know "Rob Curtis is gearing up for Friday".

624
00:53:51,527 --> 00:53:52,653
Who cares.

625
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:55,196
- The best thing is no more flushing, epic.

626
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,703
- And worst thing?
About Z-land?

627
00:53:59,015 --> 00:54:01,487
- You mean other than the fact that I shot Bill Murray?

628
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:02,448
- That's easy.

629
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:04,464
- Losing Bob.

630
00:54:04,657 --> 00:54:05,713
- That's his puppy.

631
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:11,090
- I tell you, I never thought I could love anything like Bob

632
00:54:11,227 --> 00:54:14,598
The day he was born I just lost my mind.

633
00:54:16,844 --> 00:54:17,910
- Sorry.

634
00:54:23,149 --> 00:54:27,368
He had my personality,
my laugh, my appetite,

635
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:32,598
<i> Laugh? And that's when it hit me. i felt so ashamed that it had taken me this long. </ i>

636
00:54:32,931 --> 00:54:37,335
<i> Me with the best card in the business to realize I wasn't the only one running from something. </ i>

637
00:55:00,854 --> 00:55:03,254
- We made this wallet together out of Duct Tape.

638
00:55:09,324 --> 00:55:13,683
<i> Take away a man's son, you've truly given him nothing left to lose. </ i>

639
00:55:23,667 --> 00:55:27,315
- I haven't cried like that since Titanic.

640
00:56:06,389 --> 00:56:11,983
A hint?
Why don't you exhale slowly,

641
00:56:12,676 --> 00:56:13,880
then squeeze the trigger.

642
00:56:47,191 --> 00:56:49,303
- Don't make me drink alone.
- Okay.

00:56:56,504 --> 00:56:59,767
-It 1997, "Gor Gorgeous"

644
00:57:01,304 --> 00:57:03,032
- I never took French.

00:57:02,457 --> 00:57:03,417
Gorgeus day what the hell?

646
00:57:05,974 --> 00:57:07,575
- It's a 97?
- Yeah.

647
00:57:08,606 --> 00:57:10,148
- Was that a good year?
- Oh my God.

648
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:15,391
It was a great year, are you kidding me?,
I saw my first R- rated movie that year.

649
00:57:16,352 --> 00:57:18,464
Anaconda.
- Oh, Anaconda.

650
00:57:21,365 --> 00:57:22,631
- First tattoo, a purpoise.

651
00:57:23,304 --> 00:57:24,648
- Really?
- Fake.

652
00:57:25,513 --> 00:57:26,665
- First kiss.

653
00:57:28,394 --> 00:57:29,834
Scotty Lynch

654
00:57:31,803 --> 00:57:33,100
- Did you guys.. use tongue?

655
00:57:35,166 --> 00:57:36,732
- Maybe.

656
00:57:38,653 --> 00:57:41,820
- Are you jealous of Scotty Lynch?
- Yes, I am.

657
00:57:43,452 --> 00:57:46,620
- Actually I think I'm jealous of your whole 1997.

658
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:49,213
- Let's see mine.

659
00:57:51,646 --> 00:57:55,217
First orthodontist. The bastard gave me head gear.

660
00:57:56,178 --> 00:57:58,290
- I got my first B.
- Oh no.

661
00:57:59,443 --> 00:58:01,171
- Frightening, as Anaconda

662
00:58:02,323 --> 00:58:05,011
Woodshop, which doesn't really count as a class anyway.

663
00:58:07,891 --> 00:58:10,003
Had my first school dance.

664
00:58:10,165 --> 00:58:12,795
I was Sadie Hawkins..

665
00:58:13,276 --> 00:58:14,716
girls choice.

666
00:58:17,404 --> 00:58:19,132
- What nobody picked you?

667
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:20,785
- Iz was girls choice.

668
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:23,068
- Those bitches!
- I know.

669
00:58:24,029 --> 00:58:26,909
No, I will not stand for this, you know what?

670
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:29,598
On behalf of all the eight-grade girls,

671
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:32,862
I would like you to make it up to you.

672
00:58:35,797 --> 00:58:36,959
Relax, Scotty's old news.

673
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:16,161
I don't even know your name, but this is actually really nice.

674
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:20,311
-You know? Between you, me and 

675
00:59:23,326 --> 00:59:24,724
You're actually kind of cute.

676
00:59:25,252 --> 00:59:26,584
- You think so?

677
00:59:28,601 --> 00:59:32,345
- I mean you got the guts of a guppy, but

678
00:59:32,692 --> 00:59:34,156
I could hit that.

679
00:59:38,189 --> 00:59:39,629
- Really?

680
00:59:40,590 --> 00:59:42,510
- I'll at least give you the intentional walk to first.

681
00:59:54,208 --> 00:59:56,338
- Hey little help movin' a couch.

682
00:59:57,023 --> 00:59:58,846
We're making a fort.

683
01:00:04,511 --> 01:00:08,062
- That was probably for the best, cause

684
01:00:09,407 --> 01:00:12,479
I like you, Columbus,

685
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:16,320
but my sister and I are going to do whatever it takes to survive so..

686
01:00:27,805 --> 01:00:30,073
<i> I was hoping Wichita was just playing hard to get, </ i>

687
01:00:30,504 --> 01:00:33,507
<i> but I realized that she had more trust issues than I did. </ i>

688
01:00:33,508 --> 01:00:36,388
<i> When I woke up the next day and she was leaving. </ i>

689
01:00:40,453 --> 01:00:42,611
- You are like a giant cock-blocking robot, 

690
01:00:42,612 --> 01:00:45,971
developed in a secret fucking government lab.

691
01:00:47,076 --> 01:00:49,538
- I can't believe I almost kissed him. What's our rule?

692
01:00:50,216 --> 01:00:53,138
- Trust no one, just you and me.
- Just you and me.

693
01:00:54,675 --> 01:00:55,827
- Yeah, you and me.

694
01:01:08,959 --> 01:01:13,100
- You have just survived the zombie apocalypse and drove halfway across the country.

695
01:01:13,686 --> 01:01:16,949
- Where are you gonna go?
- I'm going to Pacific Playland. Woo.

696
01:01:36,148 --> 01:01:37,588
Open Sesame.

697
01:01:47,608 --> 01:01:49,903
<i> This is the problem with getting attached to someone. </ i>

698
01:01:50,588 --> 01:01:52,191
<i> When they leave you just feel lost. </ i>

699
01:01:52,847 --> 01:01:56,946
<i> Having Tallahassee around didn't comfort me, it just made me feel more alone. </ i>

700
01:01:56,947 --> 01:02:00,787
- Hey, you weren't exactly gonna score anyway.

700
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,000
- You weren't storming' the trenches before I came along.

701
01:02:06,256 --> 01:02:09,451
That's why I don't let people close, you only get burned.

702
01:02:09,644 --> 01:02:10,508
- You don't say.


703
01:02:12,151 --> 01:02:17,526
Mexico, you know what they call Twinkies
in Mexico? Los Submerinos.

704
01:02:17,955 --> 01:02:19,818
That's where I'm headed amigo.

705
01:02:20,683 --> 01:02:21,835
- Whatever.

706
01:03:47,287 --> 01:03:49,162
- I'm going after Wichita.

707
01:03:49,163 --> 01:03:52,043
- You ever read that book "She's just not that into you"?

708
01:03:52,298 --> 01:03:55,724
- You can't make yourself too available.
- I don't care, alright I wanna be with her.

709
01:03:57,469 --> 01:03:58,628
Have fun in Mexico.

710
01:04:04,495 --> 01:04:05,476
Come on! Hurry!

711
01:04:09,413 --> 01:04:10,277
- Get in!

712
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:21,172
- Come on, come on!

713
01:04:23,093 --> 01:04:24,533
- Come on, come on!

714
01:04:36,824 --> 01:04:40,129
- On the count of three.
One, two, three.

715
01:04:54,787 --> 01:04:56,272
Are you okay? Come on.

716
01:04:56,587 --> 01:04:57,751
Hurry, get up.

717
01:04:57,752 --> 01:04:58,808
- Come on, let's go.

718
01:05:04,043 --> 01:05:05,209
- There!

718
01:05:25,043 --> 01:05:05,209
- I'm not great at farewells so.. that'll do pig.

719
01:05:31,617 --> 01:05:34,958
- That's the worst goodbye I have ever heard and you stole it from a movie.

720
01:05:38,929 --> 01:05:40,556
- Tell the ladies I said hey.

721
01:05:40,941 --> 01:05:43,629
- You know there are pictures of her in someones wallet too.

722
01:06:08,146 --> 01:06:11,787
- Hop in the car Evel Knievel. Let's go ride the roller coaster.

723
01:06:12,265 --> 01:06:13,349
- Thanks.

724
01:06:23,621 --> 01:06:24,869
- Go!

725
01:07:22,946 --> 01:07:24,962
- Not as fun as I remember.

726
01:07:29,955 --> 01:07:31,875
- Shoot the control box.

727
01:08:03,131 --> 01:08:04,758
- Columbus.
- Tallahassee.

728
01:08:04,759 --> 01:08:08,599
- I think they might actually require our hard assistance this time. Buckle up.
- I'm wide ahead of you.

729
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:16,472
- Time to nut up or shut up.

730
01:08:21,272 --> 01:08:22,232
- Holy shit.

732
01:08:43,627 --> 01:08:48,133
- My mama always told me, someday I'll be good at something.

733
01:08:48,134 --> 01:08:50,246
Who'd have guessed that something'd be zombie killin'.

734
01:08:50,535 --> 01:08:51,591
- Probably nobody.
735
01:08:52,996 --> 01:08:54,685
- Look!

736
01:08:56,671 --> 01:08:58,999
- We better start working on our apology.

737
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:26,166
- Up here!

738
01:09:27,651 --> 01:09:28,664
-Oh my God!

739
01:09:33,758 --> 01:09:34,919
- They're up there, they're okay.

740
01:09:35,202 --> 01:09:36,598
- What are you waiting for?
- It's your gal.

741
01:09:43,857 --> 01:09:47,104
- Come on!
- Come get a piece of Tallahassee!

742
01:09:47,105 --> 01:09:48,737
- Anybody hungry?

743
01:09:49,122 --> 01:09:51,618
Tallahassee-nice over here.

744
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:55,576
Come on, come on you ugly bastards.

745
01:10:13,255 --> 01:10:14,401
- Holy Shit!

746
01:10:16,706 --> 01:10:18,242
- Holy Shit!

747
01:11:16,055 --> 01:11:17,795
- Shit, I'm out of shells.

748
01:11:43,907 --> 01:11:45,155
- Here we go.

749
01:14:14,096 --> 01:14:15,508
- Wichita! Little Rock!

750
01:14:19,712 --> 01:14:21,065
<i> Oh my God </ i>

751
01:14:21,965 --> 01:14:23,644
<i> Look at this fucking clown. </ i>

752
01:14:26,948 --> 01:14:30,047
<i> Of course, it had to be a clown. </ i>

753
01:14:33,170 --> 01:14:35,295
<i> No, it had to be a clown. </ i>

754
01:14:35,816 --> 01:14:38,490
<i> And it had to be Wichita for me to finally understand </ i>

755
01:14:38,726 --> 01:14:41,134
<i> that some rules are made to be broken. </ i>

757
01:14:45,029 --> 01:14:46,469
<i> Time to nut up or shut up. </ i>

758
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:52,674
<i> Fuck this clown. </ i>

759
01:15:35,181 --> 01:15:36,170
- Thanks.

760
01:15:36,863 --> 01:15:37,994
Wichita

761
01:15:50,102 --> 01:15:52,755
- Christa.

762
01:16:24,155 --> 01:16:26,864
- Ok, we should probably head out, now. 

763
01:16:32,084 --> 01:16:34,140
- Finally he got to first base.

764
01:16:34,621 --> 01:16:37,021
Not bad for that scrawny little spit-fuck.

765
01:16:44,802 --> 01:16:46,475
- Where is [Tallahassee]

766
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:51,711
- I have a little hunch. 

767
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:58,431
- Where are you you spongy yellow delicious bastards?
Where are you?

768
01:17:05,608 --> 01:17:09,760
- False advertising!
- Jesus Christ.

769
01:17:11,297 --> 01:17:12,641
- You want a Sno-Ball or something?

770
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:40,768
- Oh God!

771
01:17:47,242 --> 01:17:49,314
Words cannot express..

772
01:17:50,859 --> 01:17:52,201
- It's too soon.

773
01:17:52,202 --> 01:17:55,081
- Do you think you can, maybe, just pick out the Buckshot and just kind of eat around it?

774
01:17:59,306 --> 01:18:00,362
- No!

775
01:18:01,323 --> 01:18:02,283
No!

776
01:18:02,764 --> 01:18:03,724
- No!

777
01:18:05,932 --> 01:18:09,484
<i> That face. That's me realizing that those smart girls </ i>

778
01:18:09,485 --> 01:18:10,925
<i> in that big black truck  </ i>

779
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:14,895
<i> and that big guy in that snakeskin jacket </ i>

780
01:18:15,079 --> 01:18:18,427
<i> they were the closest to something i had always wanted, but never really had. </ i>

781
01:18:19,441 --> 01:18:20,927
<i> A family. </ i>

782
01:18:21,091 --> 01:18:22,951
<i> I trusted them and they trusted me. </ i>

783
01:18:27,252 --> 01:18:30,046
<i> Rule No. 32
Enjoy the little things </ i>

784
01:18:30,346 --> 01:18:31,959
<i> Tallahassee got his Twinkie </ i>

785
01:18:32,793 --> 01:18:35,873
<i> and even though life will never
be simple or innocent again, </ i>

786
01:18:36,804 --> 01:18:39,846
<i> as he savored that spongy yellow log of cream, </ i>

787
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:42,685
<i> we had hope, we had each other. </ i>

788
01:18:43,797 --> 01:18:47,473
<i> And without other people, you might swell be a zombie. </ i>

789
01:18:48,818 --> 01:18:49,682
- Thank you so much
- You had us going.

790
01:18:55,442 --> 01:18:56,882
<i> So until next time remember: </ i>

791
01:18:56,970 --> 01:18:58,480
<i> Cardio, seat belts </ i>

792
01:18:58,769 --> 01:19:02,705
<i> and this really has nothing to do with anything, but a little sunscreen never hurt anybody. </ i>

793
01:19:04,722 --> 01:19:08,658
<i> I'm  Columbus, Ohio, from Zombieland saying:
Good night. </ I>
