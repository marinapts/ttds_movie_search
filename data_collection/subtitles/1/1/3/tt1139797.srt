1
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:50,384
Let The Right One In

2
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:11,131
Squeal like a pig. 
 Come on, squeal!

3
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:36,675
Squeal! Squeal! 
 Like a pig!

4
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,770
The police have ways of 
 detecting a criminal...

5
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,606
Do you remember the fire in ngby?

6
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,195
A burnt house and 
 they found a body inside.

7
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:25,033
We know that 
 the fire was started...

8
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:28,537
... to hide that this person 
 was murdered before.

9
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:32,082
So, how did we know this?

10
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:35,085
- I know. 
 - Yes, you. Go ahead.

11
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:39,548
There wasn't smoke in 
 the body's lungs.

12
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:44,094
Correct. Have you 
 heard this before?

13
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:47,181
No... I just read a lot.

14
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:51,018
What kind of books would those be?

15
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:54,229
Just books.

16
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:58,901
Ok, now I'm going 
 to talk to you about drugs.

17
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:02,321
The kind of drugs you might 
 think are most common--

18
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,286
Hey, Oskar!

19
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:12,581
What are you looking at?

20
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:18,337
Are you looking at me? 
 Eat shit!

21
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,262
Oink!

22
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,640
What a good little pig you are.

23
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:40,067
- Let's go. It's time for gym. 
 - I'm not going.

24
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:57,584
This is the weather report...

25
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,909
Excuse me...

26
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:16,246
- ... Can you tell me what time it is? 
 - I don't have a watch.

27
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:21,752
- What is that? 
 - This? It's called Halotano.

28
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,500
Get out!

29
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,852
Stupid dog!

30
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:52,254
What are you looking at?

31
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,177
Are you looking at me?

32
00:11:58,177 --> 00:12:01,430
Eat shit!

33
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:06,018
What is your problem?

34
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,438
Are you scared?

35
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,025
Squeal, then!

36
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:14,526
Squeal!

37
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:30,417
- What are you doing? 
 - Nothing.

38
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:34,505
- What are you doing? 
 - Nothing.

39
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:37,633
- Do you live here? 
 - Yes...

40
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:41,553
I live right here in the playground.

41
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:44,848
Seriously, where do you live?

42
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,979
- Next door to you. 
 - How do you know where I live?

43
00:12:57,277 --> 00:13:01,281
Just so you know 
 I can't be your friend.

44
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:06,954
- What are you trying to say? 
 - Does there have to be a reason?

45
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:11,124
That's just how it is.

46
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:22,636
How do you know I 
 want to be your friend?

47
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,456
You're supposed to help me!

48
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:02,217
Should I just 
 take care of myself?

49
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,397
Say something!

50
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:18,400
Pardon me.

51
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:23,697
They don't know 
 who murdered the boy.

52
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:27,743
I imagine that 
 many of you are worried.

53
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:29,453
The counseler will be here 
 all day long...

54
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:34,541
...so you can see him if you like. 
 Any questions?

55
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:38,295
Is it ok if we kill the murderer 
 if we see him?

56
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:42,382
That is not ok, Conny.

57
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:57,105
Oskar...

58
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:08,742
- Where are you, piggy? 
 - Piggy!

59
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:28,637
Now you go 
 directly to the school.

60
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:32,099
And don't leave the yard 
 until I get home.

61
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:36,186
- But I'm going to Vallingby. 
 - A man that kills children...

62
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:38,772
...could easily take 
 the metro for two stations.

63
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:43,068
Or walk a mile.

64
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:58,500
<i> No, Oskar, you'll stay with 
 your father next week. </i>

65
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:06,550
PUNCTURE MURDER 
 FOR BLOOD

66
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:30,908
THE VICTIM'S BLOOD 
 WAS EXTRACTED

67
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:06,818
- Hi. 
 - If not for my sweetheart...

68
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:13,617
The death penalty isn't right 
 in a just state.

69
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:17,788
A just state?

70
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:23,877
The government wants to sell us 
 that crap, like the Russians did...

71
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:28,048
Are you saying that there 
 aren't any more Russians?

72
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:31,927
- Of course there are... 
 - I've never seen one.

73
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:35,764
But like snakes 
 they haven't bit anyone.

74
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:42,229
That guy over there just moved 
 next door. He's got a daughter.

75
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:44,773
Where Janne lived.

76
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:49,778
- Should I invite him to the table? 
 - Sure...

77
00:17:51,155 --> 00:17:53,615
So long as he 
 buys us a round.

78
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:57,411
In that case he's welcome 
 although he's got cancer.

79
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:07,421
Bad news?

80
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:13,177
Yeah, life stinks...

81
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:18,932
You're in Department 15, right?

82
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:25,439
You don't have to stay here alone, 
 come and have a little fun.

83
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:29,151
No thanks, I'm in a hurry.

84
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:39,703
Mom, I'm going out for a bit.

85
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:42,498
You aren't going to watch the show?

86
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:45,250
No, I don't like it.

87
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,961
Don't leave the yard.

88
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:54,092
I'll watch it alone then.

89
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:39,930
Here you are again.

90
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:42,349
You've returned.

91
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:46,436
- I want to be alone. 
 Me too.

92
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:48,814
Go home, then.

93
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:53,277
You go home, I 
 lived here first.

94
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:02,369
- What's that? 
 - This?

95
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:04,746
A Rubik's cube.

96
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:06,832
Like a puzzle?

97
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,251
Yeah...

98
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:18,135
You wanna try it?

99
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:22,639
- You can give it back to me tomorrow. 
 I don't know if I'll come tomorrow.

100
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:25,851
The next day, then, 
 but no later.

101
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:43,410
How do you do it?

102
00:20:43,452 --> 00:20:46,121
Each side should be 
 only one color.

103
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:48,415
Like this...

104
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:19,238
You smell weird.

105
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:27,788
- Aren't you cold? 
 - No.

106
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:32,000
- Why not? 
 - I forget.

107
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:40,008
See you tomorrow.

108
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:28,891
Thanks for another night 
 of friendship and happiness.

109
00:22:28,891 --> 00:22:32,978
- See you tomorrow. 
 - You're the best, Jocke.

110
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,207
Help...

111
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:03,300
Hello?

112
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:09,097
Please help me.

113
00:23:10,224 --> 00:23:13,268
Did something bad happen?

114
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:22,945
Are you alright?

115
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:29,117
- Can you get up? 
 - No...

116
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:39,127
I'll carry you to a phone.

117
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:43,715
- Careful. 
 - You're so light.

118
00:23:47,928 --> 00:23:50,556
Son of a bitch!

119
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:40,541
Never again...

120
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:54,555
Gosta? My god what a long time. 
 I think I haven't seen you all year.

121
00:25:56,098 --> 00:25:58,225
Jocke...

122
00:25:59,393 --> 00:26:01,436
Jocke!

123
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:05,774
I was on the balcony and saw...

124
00:26:05,774 --> 00:26:10,153
...I saw Jocke and that girl.

125
00:26:10,153 --> 00:26:14,992
How old is the girl?

126
00:26:14,992 --> 00:26:18,579
He was here.

127
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:23,500
Clean it.

128
00:26:25,878 --> 00:26:30,757
What the fuck is that?

129
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:33,802
Holy shit! It's blood!

130
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:37,181
Who the fuck did this?

131
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:28,268
How did you do it?

132
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:35,651
I just turned it.

133
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:41,823
Do I smell better now?

134
00:29:46,954 --> 00:29:49,665
What's your name?

135
00:29:49,665 --> 00:29:52,251
Eli.

136
00:29:52,251 --> 00:29:56,088
- And you? 
 - Eli?

137
00:29:57,798 --> 00:30:00,592
I'm Oskar.

138
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,265
- How old are you? 
 - 12... more or less.

139
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:10,394
What about you?

140
00:30:10,435 --> 00:30:13,188
12 years, 8 months, and 9 days.

141
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:16,441
What do you mean 
 "more or less"?

142
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:20,988
When's your birthday?

143
00:30:20,988 --> 00:30:23,907
I don't know.

144
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:27,286
You don't celebrate your birthday?

145
00:30:27,453 --> 00:30:32,082
Your parents should know.

146
00:30:37,963 --> 00:30:41,300
Then you've never even 
 gotten a birthday present?

147
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:44,052
No.

148
00:30:47,973 --> 00:30:50,642
You can keep it if you want.

149
00:30:50,642 --> 00:30:53,854
It's yours.

150
00:30:57,733 --> 00:31:00,319
I don't know how to solve it.

151
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:02,654
You want me to show you?

152
00:31:06,283 --> 00:31:10,871
- Sure, here. 
 - Start with the corners.

153
00:31:10,913 --> 00:31:14,875
Then this part. And you put it...

154
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:17,753
...like this.

155
00:31:19,171 --> 00:31:23,175
No... like this, then this.

156
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:31,516
"...Dodging in and out of the shadows, 
 running rapidly and silently...

157
00:31:31,516 --> 00:31:34,561
...and hiding from the sun..."

158
00:31:34,853 --> 00:31:39,858
...They returned quickly, between 
 moans and curses, to care for the portal..."

159
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:43,904
...Bilbo had escaped."

160
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:51,578
Ok... that's all for today.

161
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:55,833
Did they give you the note 
 for the field trip on Thursday?

162
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,211
They can go then.

163
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:10,264
- Oskar, you aren't-- 
 - No, I've got stuff to do.

164
00:32:15,477 --> 00:32:18,522
Hurry up, Conny!

165
00:33:12,326 --> 00:33:14,995
What were you writing?

166
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,124
What do you mean?

167
00:33:19,124 --> 00:33:23,045
Show it to me.

168
00:33:28,592 --> 00:33:30,469
No.

169
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:34,264
What are you talking about? 
 Give it to me.

170
00:34:27,943 --> 00:34:31,864
Who's gonna tell 
 your mommy now?

171
00:34:32,322 --> 00:34:34,491
Wait for me!

172
00:34:34,491 --> 00:34:39,204
<i> Oskar... </i>

173
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:45,586
Piggy!

174
00:34:48,046 --> 00:34:50,966
I slipped in the park...

175
00:34:53,052 --> 00:34:57,973
- ...and I fell on a rock. 
 - Oh, sweetie...

176
00:34:59,183 --> 00:35:02,436
You have to look 
 where you're going.

177
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:14,615
Short, long, long, short, long...

178
00:35:15,032 --> 00:35:19,161
- Short, long, long, short, long. 
 - Exactly.

179
00:35:23,415 --> 00:35:25,083
Here...

180
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,673
What happened?

181
00:35:33,258 --> 00:35:35,886
There.

182
00:35:38,722 --> 00:35:43,018
Some classmates...

183
00:35:45,646 --> 00:35:50,025
- What school do you go to. 
 - Oskar, listen...

184
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:54,822
Answer me.

185
00:35:57,532 --> 00:36:00,911
You never answer...

186
00:36:00,911 --> 00:36:04,665
... Why not?

187
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:10,128
So do it. 
 Answer me...

188
00:36:12,047 --> 00:36:15,717
- There's three of them. 
 - Louder.

189
00:36:16,051 --> 00:36:20,389
Hit them as hard as you can, 
 and they'll leave you alone.

190
00:36:21,098 --> 00:36:25,727
- And what if they-- 
 - Then I'll help you.

191
00:36:27,396 --> 00:36:30,440
I can help you.

192
00:36:41,535 --> 00:36:43,871
Come on.

193
00:36:46,498 --> 00:36:48,875
Come on.

194
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:05,100
Move.

195
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,228
You're in the way.

196
00:37:08,228 --> 00:37:11,607
Let's go.

197
00:37:25,204 --> 00:37:29,875
Now let's see... short, short...

198
00:37:34,046 --> 00:37:39,009
G...O...O...D

199
00:37:45,265 --> 00:37:47,518
L...U...C...K

200
00:37:47,518 --> 00:37:49,520
Maintain your distance.

201
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:54,399
Not too close nor too far. 
 Keep your distance.

202
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:01,323
With rhythm and without errors.

203
00:38:04,243 --> 00:38:06,662
Yeah?

204
00:38:10,874 --> 00:38:15,504
For the weightlifting program 
 after school...

205
00:38:15,504 --> 00:38:17,923
... Can  I sign up?

206
00:38:18,132 --> 00:38:21,802
You don't have to sign up, 
 just come at 7 o'clock.

207
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:26,098
Are you thinking about doing it? 
 Sure.

208
00:38:26,515 --> 00:38:31,061
If you practice, you'll get strong.

209
00:38:33,522 --> 00:38:37,150
See ya later.

210
00:38:38,944 --> 00:38:41,780
Just a second...

211
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:45,576
Assorted candies.

212
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:55,168
Take em.

213
00:38:58,881 --> 00:39:01,258
No.

214
00:39:04,636 --> 00:39:07,639
What a pain in the ass.

215
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:11,935
I'll try one.

216
00:39:50,015 --> 00:39:51,975
I'm sorry.

217
00:40:09,868 --> 00:40:11,662
Oskar...

218
00:40:12,538 --> 00:40:15,332
Do you like me?

219
00:40:15,332 --> 00:40:18,585
Yeah, a lot.

220
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:21,338
If I wasn't a girl...

221
00:40:21,338 --> 00:40:24,591
... Would you like me the same?

222
00:40:24,883 --> 00:40:28,136
I think so.

223
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:33,600
Why do you ask?

224
00:41:04,047 --> 00:41:06,341
Oskar!

225
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:08,302
Hello, son.

226
00:41:09,845 --> 00:41:13,140
- You're home early. 
 - Hi, Dad.

227
00:42:39,643 --> 00:42:42,688
There are people who've seen my face...

228
00:42:43,063 --> 00:42:46,733
...and know that I live here with you.

229
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:49,361
Maybe you shouldn't.

230
00:42:49,361 --> 00:42:53,782
What else can 
 I do for you?

231
00:42:55,576 --> 00:42:58,620
Can you do something for me?

232
00:42:59,037 --> 00:43:03,917
Can you not see that boy 
 tonight? Please.

233
00:44:37,386 --> 00:44:39,221
What--?

234
00:44:39,221 --> 00:44:43,183
Why are you so late, Matte?

235
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:55,904
Hey, Matte.

236
00:44:57,531 --> 00:45:00,117
You can touch at home.

237
00:45:01,535 --> 00:45:04,121
Hurry up, Matte.

238
00:45:07,458 --> 00:45:10,794
What are you doing?

239
00:45:12,546 --> 00:45:16,925
- Matte! 
 - Put me down.

240
00:45:19,136 --> 00:45:21,847
Put me down!

241
00:45:24,433 --> 00:45:26,894
Help!

242
00:45:30,856 --> 00:45:33,025
Help!

243
00:45:35,736 --> 00:45:37,905
Help!

244
00:45:38,989 --> 00:45:42,367
- Matte! 
 - Help!

245
00:45:42,367 --> 00:45:47,289
- Open the goddam door! 
 - Help!

246
00:45:48,874 --> 00:45:50,709
Help!

247
00:45:52,753 --> 00:45:53,754
Help!

248
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:21,490
- Put me down! 
 - What are you doing here?

249
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:31,667
Eli.

250
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:01,840
<i> ...according to leader of the Communist 
 Party, Congressman Brezhnev. </i>

251
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:07,971
<i>An unidentified man was 
 arrested yesterday for murder... </i>

252
00:48:08,555 --> 00:48:12,810
<i>...tentatively in Vllingby 
 on the outskirts of Estocolmo. </i>

253
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:16,355
<i>The man abused himself 
 resulting in serious wounds on his face... </i>

254
00:48:16,355 --> 00:48:20,651
<i>...that made it impossible 
 to identify him. Now, sports--</i>

255
00:48:25,072 --> 00:48:28,242
<i> You can come in. Through that door. </i>

256
00:48:44,341 --> 00:48:46,802
Yeah?

257
00:48:46,844 --> 00:48:50,472
Excuse me. I'm looking for my father.

258
00:48:50,472 --> 00:48:53,475
Is he in this hospital?

259
00:48:53,684 --> 00:48:56,770
What's his name?

260
00:48:56,770 --> 00:49:01,733
He's sick. The police brought him in.

261
00:49:02,693 --> 00:49:05,863
Do you know where he is?

262
00:49:05,863 --> 00:49:08,991
He's on the seventh floor.

263
00:49:08,991 --> 00:49:12,119
But it's a restricted area. 
 You can call him...

264
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:16,081
No... that's ok.

265
00:49:19,126 --> 00:49:22,671
Poor creature.

266
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,370
Can I come in?

267
00:52:06,543 --> 00:52:08,921
A child...

268
00:52:10,172 --> 00:52:13,383
What child?

269
00:52:13,675 --> 00:52:18,013
- Why did he kill Jocke? 
 - I ... I don't know.

270
00:52:18,013 --> 00:52:22,184
Jocke was the best 
 subject I have found.

271
00:52:24,103 --> 00:52:27,356
I should tear that girl 
 apart limb from limb.

272
00:52:30,692 --> 00:52:33,487
Oskar!

273
00:52:33,487 --> 00:52:36,657
Can I come in?

274
00:52:39,201 --> 00:52:42,329
Don't look at me.

275
00:52:42,496 --> 00:52:45,791
But you have to let me in.

276
00:52:45,791 --> 00:52:49,169
Ok, come in.

277
00:52:56,343 --> 00:52:59,721
Close your eyes.

278
00:53:08,772 --> 00:53:11,567
How did you get there?

279
00:53:11,567 --> 00:53:15,571
- Flying. 
 - Yeah, right.

280
00:53:16,905 --> 00:53:19,950
You're not even there.

281
00:53:20,576 --> 00:53:23,537
You're as cold as ice.

282
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:26,957
I'm sorry...

283
00:53:27,458 --> 00:53:29,960
Do I disgust you?

284
00:53:30,669 --> 00:53:33,630
No.

285
00:53:46,852 --> 00:53:49,313
Eli...

286
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,485
Do you want to go out with me?

287
00:53:58,405 --> 00:54:00,198
What do you mean?

288
00:54:00,198 --> 00:54:01,617
Well...

289
00:54:03,994 --> 00:54:07,331
Will you be my girlfriend?

290
00:54:08,248 --> 00:54:10,542
Oskar...

291
00:54:10,542 --> 00:54:13,420
...I'm not a girl.

292
00:54:14,796 --> 00:54:18,926
But... You want 
 to go out with me, right?

293
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:24,765
Why can't we just 
 leave things as they are?

294
00:54:28,268 --> 00:54:30,396
I guess...

295
00:54:30,396 --> 00:54:33,899
Do you do anything special 
 when you go out with someone?

296
00:54:34,191 --> 00:54:37,027
No.

297
00:54:37,027 --> 00:54:41,073
So it's the same.

298
00:54:43,867 --> 00:54:46,245
Yeah.

299
00:54:49,248 --> 00:54:52,376
We'll go out together then.

300
00:54:52,376 --> 00:54:54,878
Just you and I.

301
00:54:54,878 --> 00:54:57,673
Seriously?

302
00:55:02,052 --> 00:55:04,388
Yup.

303
00:57:00,462 --> 00:57:02,881
Attention!

304
00:57:02,881 --> 00:57:06,677
The lower grades 
 will skate with me.

305
00:57:07,552 --> 00:57:11,765
The older kids 
 can skate alone.

306
00:57:12,641 --> 00:57:17,229
Watch out for her holes.

307
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:21,275
- Do you understand? 
 - vila...

308
00:57:21,608 --> 00:57:24,695
- I think you meant THE holes. 
 - THE holes.

309
00:57:26,447 --> 00:57:29,074
I meant to say THE holes!

310
00:57:29,074 --> 00:57:32,077
You want to be a "diver"?

311
00:57:32,077 --> 00:57:34,788
<i>Watch out for HER holes!</i> 

312
00:58:29,468 --> 00:58:32,804
Do you want to swim or not?

313
00:58:36,683 --> 00:58:38,769
No.

314
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:44,233
Mr. vila, I have to piss.

315
00:58:44,233 --> 00:58:47,611
- Go behind that tree. 
 - On the ice?

316
00:58:47,611 --> 00:58:51,949
Does it matter? You'll just make 
 more ice, but yellow.

317
00:58:53,617 --> 00:58:55,786
What's that stick for?

318
00:58:55,786 --> 00:58:59,123
To hit you if you 
 try anything.

319
00:58:59,123 --> 00:59:03,126
So you're a brave little 
 piggy all of the sudden?

320
00:59:09,675 --> 00:59:13,011
I'm going to push you 
 and you won't do anything.

321
00:59:13,011 --> 00:59:15,264
Isn't that right?

322
00:59:15,264 --> 00:59:21,103
<i>Little baby piggy watch where 
 you walk or I'll catch you...</i>

323
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:27,025
Look!

324
00:59:29,403 --> 00:59:31,405
Let's go.

325
00:59:31,405 --> 00:59:35,492
Mr. vila will be mad...

326
00:59:35,492 --> 00:59:38,829
Should we stay here 
 and not do anything?

327
00:59:56,722 --> 00:59:59,308
What happened there?

328
00:59:59,725 --> 01:00:02,019
What are you doing?

329
01:00:55,197 --> 01:00:58,492
<i>Of course they accuse us!</i>

330
01:00:59,117 --> 01:01:04,039
<i>What do you want him to say? 
 That my son doesn't have a father?</i>

331
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,585
Yeah! That's it!

332
01:01:08,585 --> 01:01:10,587
Here he comes.

333
01:01:10,587 --> 01:01:12,506
The school called.

334
01:01:12,506 --> 01:01:16,385
Better if you talk to your 
 father rather than me--

335
01:01:17,761 --> 01:01:20,013
Hi.

336
01:01:20,013 --> 01:01:22,182
I'm good.

337
01:01:22,683 --> 01:01:25,018
I don't know.

338
01:01:25,602 --> 01:01:30,065
Does the bike work? 
 Ok, let's see.

339
01:02:07,311 --> 01:02:09,813
Hi Oskar.

340
01:02:12,065 --> 01:02:14,860
So you finally went swimming?

341
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:18,489
I'm just kidding.

342
01:02:38,008 --> 01:02:41,511
We shouldn't be here.

343
01:02:42,137 --> 01:02:46,433
But some of the bigger kids 
 come here anyway.

344
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:52,105
And you know what? Today...

345
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:56,985
They tried to push me 
 on the ice... but I...

346
01:02:56,985 --> 01:03:04,701
...but I had a stick and I hit Conny 
 so hard they sent him to the hospital.

347
01:03:04,701 --> 01:03:07,412
Oskar...

348
01:03:09,289 --> 01:03:11,083
Yeah?

349
01:03:12,042 --> 01:03:15,254
Well done.

350
01:04:04,303 --> 01:04:07,222
What do you want us to do?

351
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:42,341
Mix...

352
01:04:42,341 --> 01:04:45,260
It doesn't hurt.

353
01:04:47,137 --> 01:04:50,474
The only thing you have to do 
 is pinch the finger.

354
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:11,578
Eli?

355
01:05:17,584 --> 01:05:20,420
Get out!

356
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:23,549
Get out of here!

357
01:06:01,587 --> 01:06:05,966
They had to use a crane to get 
 him out. You have to contact the police.

358
01:06:06,175 --> 01:06:10,012
- What's the problem, Gsta? 
 - They're going to interrogate me.

359
01:06:10,012 --> 01:06:12,514
What are you talking about?

360
01:06:12,514 --> 01:06:15,976
They took me to one of those rooms...

361
01:06:15,976 --> 01:06:18,937
...and they pointed a lamp at my face.

362
01:06:18,937 --> 01:06:23,275
- Jocke and I were like that together. 
 - I'm sorry, but I can't...

363
01:06:23,275 --> 01:06:27,529
It's your responsibility, you 
 were a witness to a crime.

364
01:06:29,531 --> 01:06:31,617
Oh god...

365
01:06:32,242 --> 01:06:35,621
You're thinking what a 
 good guy you were...

366
01:06:37,206 --> 01:06:40,584
Now that it happened, there's nothing left for me.

367
01:06:42,169 --> 01:06:44,046
Nothing.

368
01:06:44,046 --> 01:06:46,757
- Oh, Lacke. 
 - Stop it!

369
01:06:46,757 --> 01:06:50,177
Don't try that "Oh Lacke Lacke" crap.

370
01:06:52,137 --> 01:06:56,558
You don't understand, 
 you were so cold.

371
01:06:58,185 --> 01:07:00,312
No one understands.

372
01:07:08,779 --> 01:07:11,782
Very subtle, Lacke.

373
01:07:12,991 --> 01:07:16,703
Ginia, please wait.

374
01:07:23,835 --> 01:07:27,339
Can we at least talk about it?

375
01:07:37,057 --> 01:07:39,393
Let's go...

376
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:03,875
Let her go!

377
01:08:19,266 --> 01:08:22,436
<i>Wait... you brought my lighter.</i>

378
01:08:22,436 --> 01:08:26,398
That wasn't my intention, Ginia...

379
01:08:27,774 --> 01:08:30,110
I love you.

380
01:09:25,833 --> 01:09:28,919
What the fuck?

381
01:10:24,516 --> 01:10:26,685
No...

382
01:10:33,442 --> 01:10:37,446
- I didn't wait for that. 
 - You'll never do it.

383
01:10:37,529 --> 01:10:41,950
- But this time I beat you. 
 - Keep dreaming.

384
01:10:42,493 --> 01:10:45,204
You first.

385
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:57,966
- Look who's here! 
 - Good evening everyone.

386
01:11:03,055 --> 01:11:06,600
It seems like she's 
 getting along very well.

387
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:09,311
That's true.

388
01:11:10,062 --> 01:11:14,399
Oskar's here...

389
01:11:23,492 --> 01:11:26,453
Ok...

390
01:11:27,788 --> 01:11:29,873
Dad...

391
01:11:29,873 --> 01:11:33,877
-... it's your turn. 
 - We have visitors.

392
01:11:33,877 --> 01:11:38,423
It's warm and cozy here, right?

393
01:11:43,428 --> 01:11:47,808
So did you have fun?

394
01:12:20,299 --> 01:12:24,011
"I should go and live, 
 or stay and die" Take it, Eli.

395
01:13:17,022 --> 01:13:19,691
Everything turned out wrong.

396
01:13:19,691 --> 01:13:24,738
It seemed ok, but your 
 calculations were incorrect.

397
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:29,993
It was a mistake from the beginning.

398
01:13:30,285 --> 01:13:35,082
And it gets worse. When 
 you pass those buildings...

399
01:13:35,082 --> 01:13:38,835
Busy night.

400
01:13:39,127 --> 01:13:41,880
Come on in.

401
01:13:56,729 --> 01:14:00,148
Ginia? Where the hell were you?

402
01:14:02,859 --> 01:14:07,531
What happened? 
 I was so worried about you.

403
01:14:07,906 --> 01:14:13,037
- What happened to you? 
 - Leave me alone!

404
01:14:16,457 --> 01:14:18,458
No...

405
01:14:24,923 --> 01:14:27,426
Open the door you son of a bitch!

406
01:14:37,937 --> 01:14:41,356
Let me in! No...

407
01:15:03,712 --> 01:15:06,298
Oskar, is that you?

408
01:15:06,298 --> 01:15:08,675
Yeah.

409
01:16:08,026 --> 01:16:11,780
You're a vampire?

410
01:16:14,241 --> 01:16:18,328
I live on blood... if that's what you mean.

411
01:16:20,372 --> 01:16:23,542
You're...

412
01:16:23,542 --> 01:16:26,920
...dead?

413
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,922
No.

414
01:16:28,922 --> 01:16:33,135
Can't you tell?

415
01:16:35,888 --> 01:16:37,931
But...

416
01:16:40,059 --> 01:16:43,020
You're old?

417
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:45,814
I'm 12.

418
01:16:45,814 --> 01:16:49,026
But I've been 12 for 
 a very long time.

419
01:17:13,759 --> 01:17:17,763
You're poor?

420
01:17:18,222 --> 01:17:21,433
You see that egg over there?

421
01:17:21,433 --> 01:17:25,229
If you sold it you 
 could buy a nuclear power plant.

422
01:17:25,229 --> 01:17:27,439
Seriously.

423
01:17:27,439 --> 01:17:31,151
Yeah, right...

424
01:17:34,321 --> 01:17:37,116
Put your finger on it.

425
01:17:52,798 --> 01:17:56,885
Where did those rings come from?

426
01:18:01,306 --> 01:18:03,892
I'm going home.

427
01:18:03,892 --> 01:18:07,146
I have to distribute a 
 few thrills tomorrow.

428
01:18:07,146 --> 01:18:11,024
For money?

429
01:18:12,818 --> 01:18:16,738
I can give you money.

430
01:18:22,202 --> 01:18:26,790
Here. Take it if you want.

431
01:18:30,919 --> 01:18:34,047
You took this...

432
01:18:34,047 --> 01:18:37,676
...from the people 
 you killed, isn't that right?

433
01:18:37,676 --> 01:18:40,554
- They gave it to me. 
 - Who gave it to you?

434
01:18:40,554 --> 01:18:43,891
Different people.

435
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:49,896
I'm going home now.

436
01:18:51,982 --> 01:18:55,319
Yeah, you're leaving me.

437
01:19:06,288 --> 01:19:10,792
The time has come to sell this. 
 Dad's stamp collection.

438
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:16,006
This one, one stamp...

439
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:25,349
...is worth $80,000.

440
01:19:25,557 --> 01:19:30,562
If we find a good buyer 
 we won't get less than that...

441
01:19:31,354 --> 01:19:34,608
Then we'll buy this pretty cabin.

442
01:19:35,192 --> 01:19:38,737
The country is so beautiful.

443
01:19:38,737 --> 01:19:43,033
We can both live there.

444
01:19:43,033 --> 01:19:47,287
Listening to the birdsong 
 and growing vegetables...

445
01:19:48,706 --> 01:19:51,875
Lacke, you have to help me.

446
01:19:51,875 --> 01:19:54,252
Sure...

447
01:19:54,252 --> 01:19:57,881
That girl...

448
01:19:58,090 --> 01:20:02,469
May have infected me somehow.

449
01:20:03,095 --> 01:20:07,141
I don't want to keep on living.

450
01:20:59,318 --> 01:21:01,987
Good morning!

451
01:21:01,987 --> 01:21:05,532
Everything went well. 
 I think I'll go home today.

452
01:21:06,533 --> 01:21:08,577
Wouldn't he like to?

453
01:21:08,577 --> 01:21:11,372
We'll take this...

454
01:21:11,372 --> 01:21:15,375
And we'll take a blood sample. 
 There we go.

455
01:21:19,296 --> 01:21:21,548
Listen...

456
01:21:23,342 --> 01:21:26,845
Can I open the blinds?

457
01:21:26,845 --> 01:21:31,141
Sure... no problem.

458
01:21:41,902 --> 01:21:45,572
Give me your hat. Let's go!

459
01:21:45,572 --> 01:21:48,408
What's your problem? 
 Give it to me.

460
01:21:48,617 --> 01:21:52,287
Are you stupid? 
 Come on, give it to me.

461
01:21:52,287 --> 01:21:54,665
Give it to him hard, Conny!

462
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:59,294
- Fight. 
 - Are you blind as well as deaf?

463
01:21:59,419 --> 01:22:02,381
- Hi. 
 - What's up?

464
01:22:02,381 --> 01:22:05,759
Can you give me the keys? 
 I'm going home.

465
01:22:05,759 --> 01:22:10,222
- Sure, here you go. 
 - Thanks, see ya.

466
01:22:10,222 --> 01:22:13,726
- Who sent you home? 
 - Good, good...

467
01:22:14,184 --> 01:22:18,855
- What are you laughing at? 
 - Are you hard of hearing, Conny?

468
01:22:39,376 --> 01:22:42,212
- Hi. 
 - Hi.

469
01:22:50,471 --> 01:22:53,557
You have to invite me in.

470
01:22:53,557 --> 01:22:57,937
And if I don't?

471
01:22:57,937 --> 01:23:00,731
What happens if you just come in?

472
01:23:00,731 --> 01:23:04,693
Is there something in your way?

473
01:24:05,253 --> 01:24:07,214
No!

474
01:24:07,214 --> 01:24:11,093
Come in!

475
01:24:20,978 --> 01:24:24,731
Who are you?

476
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:27,651
I'm just like you.

477
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:30,153
What do you mean?

478
01:24:30,153 --> 01:24:33,866
What are you looking at? 
 Huh?

479
01:24:33,866 --> 01:24:36,702
Are you looking at me?

480
01:24:36,785 --> 01:24:39,163
Scream then!

481
01:24:39,163 --> 01:24:41,165
Squeal!

482
01:24:43,333 --> 01:24:47,796
Those are the first words 
 that I heard you say.

483
01:24:50,465 --> 01:24:53,260
I don't kill people.

484
01:24:54,136 --> 01:24:58,140
But you'd like it if you could...

485
01:24:58,140 --> 01:25:02,853
For revenge, right?

486
01:25:02,937 --> 01:25:04,604
Yeah.

487
01:25:04,604 --> 01:25:08,358
I do it because I have to.

488
01:25:10,903 --> 01:25:15,032
I know, Eli, just for a while.

489
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:40,683
Please, Oskar, I know Eli.

490
01:26:32,109 --> 01:26:36,280
I can give you one of my mom's dresses.

491
01:27:08,062 --> 01:27:09,980
<i>Oskar...</i>

492
01:27:10,272 --> 01:27:13,817
<i>...let me in.</i>

493
01:27:16,194 --> 01:27:18,780
<i>What are you doing?</i>

494
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:22,534
I'm in the tub, I'm be right there.

495
01:27:23,035 --> 01:27:25,454
<i>Let me in, Oskar.</i>

496
01:28:50,122 --> 01:28:55,585
Hi, I'm in the tub. Please 
 don't come in. You want to go out tonight?

497
01:28:55,585 --> 01:28:59,298
I'd like that very much. Come in, Eli. 

498
01:32:37,141 --> 01:32:39,226
I can't see...

499
01:32:39,893 --> 01:32:41,520
No!

500
01:32:53,490 --> 01:32:56,160
Let me go!

501
01:33:40,371 --> 01:33:43,207
Thanks.

502
01:33:47,127 --> 01:33:49,421
Oskar...

503
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:55,552
I should go far away.

504
01:35:14,923 --> 01:35:19,136
WHO KILLED THE MAN IN THE ICE?

505
01:37:18,338 --> 01:37:21,758
<i>Hello? Is that you, Oskar?</i>

506
01:37:22,968 --> 01:37:27,806
<i>It's me, Martin. Mr. Avila wants 
 to know if you're coming tonight.</i>

507
01:37:29,350 --> 01:37:31,226
Why?

508
01:37:31,226 --> 01:37:35,480
<i>Just wants to know, I guess.</i>

509
01:37:35,856 --> 01:37:38,191
<i>I'm sure he wants you to come.</i>

510
01:37:38,191 --> 01:37:41,612
I'm not sure...

511
01:37:41,612 --> 01:37:45,699
That was good... 
 What you did to Conny.

512
01:37:45,699 --> 01:37:50,412
- He earned it. 
 - What an actor...

513
01:37:50,704 --> 01:37:52,998
<i>You think so?</i>

514
01:37:52,998 --> 01:37:56,084
Sure. Are you coming tonight?

515
01:38:19,232 --> 01:38:23,695
- Ok, Oskar. 
 - Hi.

516
01:38:29,660 --> 01:38:32,955
Hi, Oskar.

517
01:38:36,041 --> 01:38:38,669
Hi.

518
01:38:38,669 --> 01:38:42,839
Come on, let's do aerobics in the water.

519
01:38:53,559 --> 01:38:55,978
Hurry up!

520
01:39:07,656 --> 01:39:10,117
Come on, Oskar! Let's go!

521
01:39:13,037 --> 01:39:15,205
Move it.

522
01:39:24,256 --> 01:39:26,675
What? Oh god!

523
01:39:42,441 --> 01:39:45,777
<i>Call the firemen! Fire!</i>

524
01:40:07,049 --> 01:40:09,843
Stop!

525
01:40:09,843 --> 01:40:12,346
Get out!

526
01:40:47,256 --> 01:40:50,509
Do you know who I am?

527
01:40:50,509 --> 01:40:54,555
- Yes. 
 - Ok, then you should understand.

528
01:40:54,763 --> 01:40:57,683
Let's have a little contest.

529
01:40:57,683 --> 01:41:01,437
You have to stay under the water...

530
01:41:01,896 --> 01:41:04,439
...for three minutes.

531
01:41:04,439 --> 01:41:07,859
If you can do it I'll only cut you a little.

532
01:41:07,859 --> 01:41:10,654
But if you can't...

533
01:41:10,654 --> 01:41:13,240
...I'll take an eye.

534
01:41:13,240 --> 01:41:17,202
An eye for an ear, 
 does that sound fair?

535
01:41:18,037 --> 01:41:20,623
But it's impossible.

536
01:41:20,623 --> 01:41:23,375
That's your problem.

537
01:41:35,637 --> 01:41:37,973
Three minutes.

538
01:41:39,391 --> 01:41:42,770
You'd better breathe deep.

539
01:41:43,562 --> 01:41:47,024
five, four, three...

540
01:41:47,858 --> 01:41:50,277
