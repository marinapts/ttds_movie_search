1
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:52,935
You know, after last year's corporate,
my wife was always encouraging me.

2
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,259
You know, she said: you did fine,
you did fine in the corporate.

3
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,339
I was a bit nervous. This
little guy... hello. Sorry.

4
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,819
That's nice, eh? Nice background
with the people there...

5
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,259
We are here at the... must I look..?
- Just look straight at the lens.

6
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,179
We are here at the... MNU head office,

7
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,459
Department of Alien Affairs.
My name is Wikus Van De Merwe.

8
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,899
And behind me you can see
the Alien Affairs' workers.

9
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,939
And what we do here at
this department is...

10
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,739
we try to engage with the Prawn

11
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:26,230
on behalf of MNU and
on behalf of humans.

12
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,299
To everyone's surprise, the
ship didn't come to a stop

13
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,259
over Manhattan or Washington or Chicago,

14
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:40,260
but instead it costed to a halt
directly over the city of Johannesburg.

15
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,299
The doors didn't open for 3 months. It
just hovered there. Nobody could get in.

16
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,939
And they eventually decided,
after much deliberation,

17
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:53,940
that the best thing to do would
be to physically cut their way in.

18
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,560
We were on the verge of first contact.

19
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,299
The whole world was watching.

20
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,699
Expecting, I don't know...

21
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,660
...music from heaven and
bright shining lights.

22
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,460
Oh my God!

23
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,419
The creatures were
extremely malnourished,

24
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,939
they were very unhealthy,
they seemed to be aimless.

25
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,979
There was a lot of international
pressure on us at the time.

26
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,459
The entire world was
looking at Johannesburg,

27
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,699
so we had to do the right thing.

28
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,739
The government then established
an aid group that started to

29
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:48,619
ferry the aliens to a temporary
camp set up just beneath the ship.

30
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,019
We didn't have a plan.
There was a million of them.

31
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,179
So, what was a temporary
holding zone soon became fenced,

32
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,579
became militarized. And before
we knew it, it was a slum.

33
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,859
But the truth is, nobody
really knew what this place was.

34
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,065
There's a lot of secrets in District 9.

35
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,139
At first, a lot of
attention was given to...

36
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,779
giving the aliens a proper
status and protection.

37
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,579
They're spending so much
money to keep them here.

38
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,699
When they could be spending
it on other things, but...

39
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:35,045
...at least they're keeping
them separate from us.

40
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,859
l want to be realistic with everyone.
The aliens will not be able to go home.

41
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,870
The aliens are here to stay.

42
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,179
There were literally
thousands of different theories

43
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,219
as to why the ship seemed inoperable,
and what was speculated was that

44
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,219
the command module had detached
itself from the main ship,

45
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,819
and then somehow
mysteriously became lost.

46
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:02,099
Did it fall by itself or was
it programmed? I don't know.

47
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,059
Examination of the old video footage

48
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:10,645
shows very clearly that a
piece falls from the ship.

49
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,419
We look for it. We look everywhere.

50
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,099
This piece that's falling
caused us bloody problems.

51
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,459
More energy weapon caches found.

52
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,219
The Special task force
conducted raids in District 9.

53
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,619
Where there's a weapon, there's
crime. Tensions rose, and rose.

54
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,379
People became more and more fed up,
and eventually the rioting started.

55
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,939
Residents in Tembisa rioted
for the third consecutive night

56
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:38,940
in an attempt to remove all
the aliens from their township.

57
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,819
I think they must fix
that ship and they must go.

58
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,899
A virus, a selective virus.
Release it near the aliens.

59
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,779
They must just go. I
don't know where, just go.

60
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,179
If they was from another
country we might understand.

61
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,219
But they are not even from this planet.

62
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,819
The government have
enforced a nationwide curfew.

63
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,059
The aliens, prawns,
they take my wife away.

64
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,619
The derogatory term Prawn is used for
the alien, and obviously it implies

65
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,699
something that is a bottom feeder,
that scavenges the leftovers.

66
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,939
I mean, you can't say
they don't look like that.

67
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,219
That's what they look like,
right? They look like prawns.

68
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,779
The aliens made off with an undisclosed
amount of cash. One bystander was hurt.

69
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,059
What for an alien might be
seen as something recreational,

70
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,179
setting fire to a
truck, derailing a train,

71
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,659
is for us obviously an
extremely destructive act.

72
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,019
They can take the sneakers
you are wearing off you.

73
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,459
They take whatever you have on
you. Your cell phone or anything.

74
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,180
After that they kill you.

75
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,979
And now, after 20 years, public
pressure had forced the government

76
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:46,059
to shift the aliens out of Johannesburg.

77
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,659
They had had enough and they
wanted District 9 to be moved,

78
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,059
and more intensively
policed and controlled.

79
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,779
So, to enforce this mass eviction,
the government turned to MNU.

80
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,139
Welcome all and thank you for coming.

81
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,099
Please listen very
closely to this briefing.

82
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:06,339
Today we start a very complex
and delicate operation.

83
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,419
This is the largest operation
that MNU has ever undertaken,

84
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:14,619
and we believe that it is going
to be undertaken successfully.

85
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,979
It is to move 1.8 million prawns

86
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:22,579
from their present home in District
9 to a safer and better location

87
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,499
200 kilometers outside
of Johannesburg City.

88
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,299
We built a nice new facility
where the prawn can go,

89
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,219
he can be comfortable,
he can stay there...

90
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,019
The people of Johannesburg and
of South Africa are going to live

91
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,539
happily and safely, knowing
that that prawn is very far away.

92
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:44,459
UIO protocol dictates
that we give the aliens

93
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,179
24 hours notice of our right to evict.

94
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:53,659
Today, you will serve these notices
getting the aliens to sign I-27 form.

95
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:58,419
The legality that MNU is using to
evict the aliens is simply a whitewash.

96
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:03,619
I'm going to appoint a field
officer to take direct command.

97
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,665
Wikus Van De Merwe.

98
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,219
Everybody always said that
Wikus was not a very smart boy,

99
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:15,045
but he was a wonderful son.
That was my Wikus, just...

100
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,819
Feels like life on the big
stage. Thank you Piet... Mr Smith.

101
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,379
l had to put aside the fact that
my daughter was married to Wikus.

102
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,339
That didn't affect my
decision to promote him.

103
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:33,219
It's almost as big as my wedding
day. You know... not as big.

104
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,579
Wikus was always making me things.

105
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,539
He said that way they
just mean so much more.

106
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,579
He left this paper-mache
bowl on the sofa one day

107
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:46,099
and I didn't see it and I sat
down, and I... kinda squashed it.

108
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,899
They took all his stuff away
for the investigation, and...

109
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,459
I made them bring it all back.

110
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,059
Hey, congratulations,
man! -Thanks, man.

111
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,499
Okay, you're gonna go to P7.
- Wikus! -How is it going, man?

112
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,179
Here's the shake. P9 for you. -Thanks.

113
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,939
I'm not saying what he
did was right, but...

114
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,819
he took the choices
that were given to him.

115
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,779
This is Trent. Fundiswa, Trent. -Hi.

116
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,659
Fundiswa is the guy that
I've selected to replace me.

117
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,659
If he can make it
today, eh? -I'll make it.

118
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,739
I just want everyone
watching this right now

119
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,299
to learn from what has
happened. -You would think...

120
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:27,539
things like this would happen
to somebody else, not to me.

121
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,259
How is it going, man? Long time,
mate. Have you got my stuff?

122
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,859
Hey, boss! -How is it
going? -I'm all right, boss.

123
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,539
Good, good, this is Fundiswa.
He is training with us today.

124
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,339
I think I was disgusted
with the way he worked.

125
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:42,299
There was always just a hint
of something not quite kosher

126
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,099
with mr Van De Merwe.
- Nobody saw it coming at all.

127
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,899
None of us had any idea
of what he was doing.

128
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,339
l think it is a great
thing to see that...

129
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,539
it's not the military
guys in charge this time.

130
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,779
Not to say that Koobus and
his cowboys are not wanted.

131
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,979
You guys are always wanted.

132
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,705
You see now, these are the cowboys.

133
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,219
They shoot first, and then
they answer the questions.

134
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,259
Sorry, is this above the
allocated amount of ammunition?

135
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,499
Because I see your
pouches are full but...

136
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,819
I think maybe you should
speak to the colonel.

137
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,539
F.A.G. over here says that
we got too much ammunition.

138
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,099
No, all I'm saying,
Koobus, is that, you know...

139
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,099
you should find ways of making
you guys more efficient...

140
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,299
Listen to me, you fuck!

141
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,690
Get him outta my face.

142
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,819
There are rules, we're all
living by rules in this world.

143
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,139
Well, l don't think he can
be forgiven for what he did,

144
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,139
cause it's like a betrayal.
- I've gotta get going, Les.

145
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:43,140
I think we're gonna have to cut this
interview, cause we're gonna go...

146
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,460
12 KILOMETERS FROM DISTRICT 9

147
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,539
Take your magazines,
people. Come on, lets go.

148
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,739
The Prawn doesn't really understand
the concept of ownership of property.

149
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:15,259
So, we have to come there and
say: listen, this is our land.

150
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,860
Please, will you go?

151
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,299
It's difficult to put
the vest on by yourself.

152
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,339
Thomas, can you help
me? -All right, boss.

153
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,939
They told me I was gonna get
the vest inside the Casper.

154
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,739
Thomas, just look on the
side if there's a vest there?

155
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,939
I'm just concerned about my family.
- Don't worry about the vest, it'll be fine.

156
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,059
Rights groups have demanded
that mercenaries should comply

157
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,419
with all UYO regulations in District 9.

158
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,619
We're coming to you from
the entrance of District 9

159
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,379
as today, Multi National
United sets out to relocate

160
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:51,299
approximately 1.8 million alien
residents from their homes.

161
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,219
Human rights groups are
keeping a watchful eye,

162
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,895
as many suspect abuses might occur.

163
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,219
We're seeing heavily armed
private security forces

164
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,739
being deployed into District 9.

165
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,605
Backed up by significant air support.

166
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,499
We'll go shack to shack and
get them to sign the form.

167
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,180
First one EX 247.

168
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:42,820
We're seeing the convoy stop.
The operation is about to begin.

169
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,780
Just stay focused.

170
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:49,725
Are you ready,
Thomas? -Yeah. -Okay.

171
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,379
Is that a signal? Okay, fellows.

172
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,105
You stay behind us. Good luck, boy.

173
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:09,099
Stay low! Where is he going? What is it?

174
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,499
It's clear that security is very high.

175
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:16,800
This is only the beginning
of a total clamp down.

176
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:30,670
This is MNU agents. Open
the door please! -Open up!

177
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,260
Hello! Hello, hello...

178
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,899
This is Wikus Van De Merwe from MNU.

179
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,299
We are here to serve
you an eviction notice.

180
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,099
You just put your
scrawl there. -Fuck off!

181
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,419
All right! Thomas, hold it!
We've got his scrawl there.

182
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:51,019
Because as he hit it,
it counts as a scrawl.

183
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,619
First time we come in, there
will always be a little bit

184
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,219
of tension happening
between us and them.

185
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,819
Hey, you can't eat that, man!

186
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,899
The prawn likes to eat the rubber.
To him it's like a marshmallow.

187
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:06,675
No, no! Guard! Don't
confront him like that!

188
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:13,225
Did you see that? Right
in the roost. Stay calm!

189
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,859
This is gonna be a problem cause
now all prawns are coming out,

190
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,619
they wanna see what's
going on. Stop it! Stop it!

191
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,299
Bring my kit. See,
everybody is gathering now.

192
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,139
Don't shoot or you're gonna
turn it into a warzone!

193
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,139
What is that? Is that a
tear gas? -No, it's cat food.

194
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,979
It is cat food. I just distract them.

195
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:37,760
One of them attacked the
prawn and he's lost his arm.

196
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:42,259
No it's not my house. I don't live here.

197
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:45,139
Well, that's a pity
because, you know, this...

198
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:49,179
This is a nice cat food, you know.
But of course, it's not your house.

199
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,139
So, we'll just have to go and give it
to someone else. -Yes! It's my house!

200
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,539
We need you to sign here.
Now you can take that...

201
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,700
All right. Stop it!

202
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,219
The creatures became incredibly
obsessed with cat food.

203
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:07,220
Something about it, like catnip
for cats. Only a lot more intense.

204
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,139
Hello? MNU. We are here
to serve eviction notices.

205
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,620
What is eviction?

206
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,299
What we have stranded
on Earth in this colony,

207
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,539
is basically the workers that are
unable to think for themselves.

208
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,299
They will take commands,
they have no initiative.

209
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,699
They've lost all the apt of leadership

210
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:34,230
through whatever cause.
We presume illness.

211
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:40,190
I'm holding steady over
Nigerian compound area.

212
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,379
Where there's a slum, there's crime.
And District 9 was no exception.

213
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:57,499
The nigerians had various scams going.
One of them was the cat food scam.

214
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,459
Where they sold cat food to the
aliens for exorbitant prices.

215
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:07,419
You put the money here first. You
don't get anything until you pay.

216
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:10,859
What are you trying to do?
I'll chop your balls off.

217
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,579
Not to mention
interspecies prostitution,

218
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,259
and they also dealt in alien weaponry.

219
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,739
You have a car hijacking,
there's a chop shop there,

220
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,979
you can see that, that's
somebody's car in there.

221
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:25,379
The nigerians in District 9 are
headed by a man called Obesandjo.

222
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,619
He's a very powerful underground
figure in Johannesburg.

223
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,659
You don't want to play with these boys.

224
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,860
They will cut you into pieces.

225
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,659
That's the boss there. OK, no problem.

226
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:42,865
Don't look at him! This
is gonna cause problems.

227
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,490
All right, next. 766, all right.

228
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,619
MNU agents. Open the door please!

229
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,420
Whoa! Jesus! What is it?

230
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,180
Check the other side!

231
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,539
Control, this is Wikus Van De Merwe.

232
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,539
I need a population control team
at JV 766 immediately, please.

233
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:09,139
Check the other side, Thomas!
There is 40 to 50 eggs in here.

234
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:12,339
Is this normal? -This
is an amazing find.

235
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,539
l can just show you a
little bit how it works.

236
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,579
Basically, a cow is hung from
the ceiling, you can see here.

237
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,579
Very little of it left, of
course, because all these pipes

238
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,779
supply the nutrition to
the little prawn eggs.

239
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:27,339
You can do one, I can show
you, want to see? -No, I'm fine.

240
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,939
There we go. Okay, no
more nutrition to the guy.

241
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,739
Then finally we take air back.

242
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,939
The little guy is gone to
a nice little sleep now.

243
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,259
You pop him out, there
we go. Pop him out here.

244
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:43,179
You can take that. You wanna keep it
as a souvenir of your first abortion.

245
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:47,939
You can feel like you did one
of these here. -Thanks, boss.

246
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:52,139
Okay, here it comes,
guys. This is the snake.

247
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,739
If we were going to abort
each egg one at the time,

248
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,419
it'd take a very long time.
So, this makes a lot of sense.

249
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:01,819
You hear that? That's a popping
sound that you're hearing.

250
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,899
It's almost like a popcorn.

251
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,499
What the egg does, it pops up.

252
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,499
The little guy, what's
left of him, pops out there.

253
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,619
So that's the sound that
you're hearing with the popping.

254
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:16,379
You don't need that, man.
Only sissies wear that.

255
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,859
Been drinking a little bit here, eh?

256
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:24,179
What are you doing with this
television set, sir? What's this?

257
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,419
Hey, smile for the cameras here.

258
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,859
That's a first day
find. -That's a big find.

259
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,739
You see this? Trent, look at this!
There's weapons all over here.

260
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,060
CK 5, 7572...

261
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,300
Some of the guns are small

262
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:42,770
but if it shoot you, it make a big mess.

263
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,899
MNU is trying to move the
aliens for humanitarian reasons.

264
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,099
But the real focus, just as it has been

265
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,899
right from the beginning, is weapons.

266
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,819
MNU is the second largest
weapons manufacturer in the world.

267
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,819
We assumed that we'd be able
to pick up the alien laser gun

268
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,659
and just be able to shoot,
but it didn't work like that.

269
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,259
Because, as we discovered,
their technology is actually

270
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,819
engineered in a biological manner to
interact exclusively with their DNA.

271
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:15,219
It just doesn't work with humans.
And it's as simple as that.

272
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,179
This is basically a guy,
and there's 3 humans here.

273
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,939
Basically trying to
make a warning, you know.

274
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,259
He's saying "I kill 3
humans, watch out for me."

275
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:29,579
Hey, don't urinate on your own
bloody... get back, get back.

276
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:34,179
This is Wikus, requesting
First Battalion escort, please.

277
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,659
You want to talk to them
or you want to talk to me?

278
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,180
No, not them!

279
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:52,140
Okay, guys, thanks very much.
Yeah I know, he had a spade.

280
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,900
Look-I find some!

281
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:12,459
I tell you before... this is
human technology, it is useless.

282
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,659
Only our technology contains the fluid.

283
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,499
This is not our
technology? -No, it's junk.

284
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,420
Keep looking.

285
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,820
I find something.

286
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,740
Yes. This is what we need.

287
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,260
Good, little one.

288
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,540
Get down!

289
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,580
Careful... wait...

290
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,820
...there.

291
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,420
Why must it take so long?

292
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,859
Because it is very difficult...

293
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,620
...so much can go wrong.

294
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,820
Twenty years of work.

295
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:20,505
Our plan is ready now?
- Quiet... listen...

296
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,580
...they are coming.

297
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,659
You must hide this.
They must not find it.

298
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,739
Answer the door and be polite.

299
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,060
No! You take it.

300
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,179
You see, this is the problem.
This is the gang sign.

301
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,779
You see this? So again,
looks like we have

302
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,179
more and more gang members.

303
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,979
Fundiswa, you just stay
back. You stay behind Thomas.

304
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,339
This place is swarming with
MNU. I will be searched.

305
00:20:55,340 --> 00:21:00,019
I must get back to my son.
Don't make them angry - be polite!

306
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,819
MNU agents, open the door please.

307
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,259
Hello? We would like you
to... -Nobody is here.

308
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:09,819
Okay, that's unexceptable.
That is totally unexceptable!

309
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,979
Get out! Get out! You stupid prawn!

310
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,560
- Get outside!
- C'mon! Move! Move!

311
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,699
On your knees! -I'm gonna have a look.

312
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,779
Just stay there! Right there!

313
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,659
Sir, we have to serve
you an eviction notice.

314
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,659
Do you understand it? -No.

315
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,859
This is a classic kind of
gangsta shack, I can tell you.

316
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:42,899
We're gonna find weapons here.
Watch your head, don't hit the cows.

317
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,939
Just checking for
panels. Ah, you hear that?

318
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,520
Yeah, it's hollow there.

319
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,420
See? Look at that!

320
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:55,459
I haven't see this type of
setup. It's almost like a...

321
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:58,040
chemistry type of a set.

322
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,140
It's gotta be something.

323
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:15,099
l don't know, this has got
the markings there of...

324
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,099
...so it is definitely alien.

325
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:23,025
But it's not a weapon.
But I don't trust it.

326
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:29,315
Are you all right?
Wikus, are you all right?

327
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:36,179
Switch it off, please. Just turn it off.

328
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:39,619
Are you gonna cut that part
out, Trent, where it sprays me?

329
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,859
- Yeah, don't worry.
- You cut that.

330
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,339
We just found a dangerous object here.

331
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:49,739
It has a fuel in and I suspect it
might leak onto people or cause damage.

332
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,499
So we just check that in and we
take that down nicely to the lab.

333
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,779
It's not a weapon but it's dangerous.

334
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:59,139
He's got weapons somewhere here,
my sense is telling me that.

335
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,859
Lets check the other side
here. Thomas! -Yes sir?

336
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,259
Thomas, keep the gun on
him. -OK, I got it sir!

337
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,819
Keep the gun on him,
Thomas, there's weapons here!

338
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,219
Oh, this is Christmas! This
is Christmas, my friends.

339
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,779
This is the biggest
find that I've ever seen.

340
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,019
Control, come in. Wikus Van De Merwe,

341
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,690
requesting First Reaction Battalion.

342
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,260
Stand by, guys!

343
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,539
This gun I've never
seen. Have you seen this?

344
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,939
This is amazing! Look at
this gun. What gun is this?

345
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,939
This is absolutely amazing!

346
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,339
- What are you doing?
- I wanna show this to Thomas.

347
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,339
But I thought you said
you can't handle it.

348
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,379
No, I am not handling it,
I'm just gonna show it.

349
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,339
I'm not gonna use it, man. It
doesn't even work with humans.

350
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,015
Thomas, look at this gun!

351
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:51,805
- That's not mine.
- You're a dealer, eh? -No.

352
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,539
You hear this, sir? You
see what's happening?

353
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:57,179
First Battalion, my friend.
You know what that means?

354
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,779
That means that your days of
flaunting the law are over.

355
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,179
Have a look, you see that? What's that?

356
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,475
That's a firing team.

357
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,140
Come here!

358
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,419
Wikus! Are you all right?

359
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,939
Where do you think you're going, eh?

360
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,979
You don't run away from
the chopper. -No, no...

361
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:46,950
Where do you think you're
going? You wanna piss me off?

362
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,920
Koobus to base, come in!

363
00:24:55,540 --> 00:25:00,579
I've got two people down.
MNU guard, MNU agent.

364
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:03,579
It's the Foxtrot
Yankee 5-3-0... copy?

365
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,259
And we need a Med Evac ASAP.

366
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:09,139
No, that's fine, Koobus.
I don't need a Med Evac.

367
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,579
Wikus, you burned your
arm, you need to...

368
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:15,020
I'll just treat it here, Koobus.

369
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,779
Sir, I really think you must go to
a doctor, a hospital or something.

370
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,259
- No, no.
- You should just get it checked out.

371
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:24,819
I'll just have it treated
by the medics. Help me up.

372
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,059
Did you see how fast
that prawn was, Trent?

373
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:32,265
- Yeah, he was fast.
- He was fast, I promise you.

374
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:41,059
Look, I fix it. I make it work.

375
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:44,215
I told you not to touch that.

376
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,460
What is wrong?

377
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:50,379
Nothing. Go outside
and watch for humans.

378
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,700
Where is your friend?

379
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,100
He's gone.

380
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,979
Are you okay? -Yeah,
I'm just a bit hot.

381
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:11,459
Are you guys hot? Are
you hot, Trent? -No.

382
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:16,619
Yeah, if you can't stand the
heat get out of the kitchen.

383
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:20,535
Now you see. There's kids everywhere.

384
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,619
This is what I mean. That's
why we get rid of them.

385
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:26,059
- The little ones.
- Yeah, that's why we abort.

386
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:29,779
Lets just shoot the little bastard.
- No, no, don't shoot it now.

387
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,100
MNU agents! Come out!

388
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,819
Hello, little guy.
MNU has sweets for you.

389
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:37,499
There you go, eat your sweety.

390
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,259
You know, eaty sweety. Works
like a charm every time.

391
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,180
Oh fuck, man!

392
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,819
You almost poked my eye out
with the fokkin' lollypop.

393
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:49,499
I tried to be fokkin' nice to you, man!

394
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,019
Is this your fokkin' little brat here?

395
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:55,179
Inside, go! I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

396
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,659
Teach him some manners.
Thomas, get him out.

397
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,899
Come! Get down! I've had
enough of your stupid games.

398
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,220
What do you want?

399
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,819
We're from MNU. -I know.

400
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,779
We require your scrawl on
this eviction notification.

401
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,779
- Why am I being evicted?
- Yes, it's an eviction notice.

402
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:15,139
Put your scrawl on the bottom.
See? There's your name at the top.

403
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:18,139
- Yes! - Christopher Johnson? So, put
your name in the bottom.

404
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,539
It says you must give
me 24 hours notice.

405
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,659
You're going to another place. A nice
new city built especially for prawns.

406
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:26,619
- A special place! - And we are not
even going to charge you, okay?

407
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:31,680
This isn't legal. -Sign
the fokkin' paper! -No!

408
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,059
This guy is obviously...
he's a little sharper.

409
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:38,139
So we are gonna have
to try something else.

410
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,379
All right. Hello... okay.

411
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:43,739
Seems like we didn't understand
each other there properly, eh?

412
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,139
So, you've got a little one there.

413
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,739
Do you have a licence
for that little one? -Yes.

414
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:52,299
There's a litter out here. This is
dangerous conditions for your child.

415
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,499
Article 75 says that because
your child is living in dangerous

416
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,299
conditions, I'm gonna take
him down to Child Services.

417
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,499
I'm gonna go and have a
little chat with your son.

418
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,510
You keep away from my child!

419
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,059
Don't point your
fokkin' tentacles at me!

420
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,059
You said you want to stay?

421
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,859
Your boy is coming down
with me to Child Services.

422
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:13,979
He's gonna spend the rest of
his life in 1 by 1 meter box.

423
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:18,099
Hello, little guy! It's
the sweety man coming!

424
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,825
Fuck, look at this, Trent! Fuck it!

425
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,339
Thomas, keep the gun on him.
He is definitely a criminal!

426
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:28,619
He's got a whole
computer shop here, man!

427
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,659
You know, this is amazing.
I mean, this is obviously...

428
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:35,179
you can see stolen computers now
that he's decorating his place with.

429
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,979
Definitely he doesn't
have the permit for this.

430
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,560
Where is that fokkin' little brat?

431
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,405
Hello! It's the sweety man...

432
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:49,880
It's the sweety... Hey, I've got this...

433
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,955
- Wikus!
- Trent, turn it off!

434
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,770
Are you okay, boss?
- Fuck off, man! Fuck off!

435
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:15,190
Shall I leave him? -Just
fuckin' leave him, yeah.

436
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:19,059
I'll see you tomorrow,
Christopher Johnson.

437
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:22,019
<i>When dealing with aliens,
try to be polite, but firm.</i>

438
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:25,459
<i>And always remember that a
smile is cheaper than a bullet.</i>

439
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:28,419
Are you feeling better?
- What? -How are you feeling?

440
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:31,819
I'm fine, I'm alright. I'm
just a little bit dizzy.

441
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:34,419
Can you just pull up there on the side?

442
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:38,910
I just want to get
something to eat here.

443
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,619
Are you sure you should be having that?

444
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,819
After your whole puking episode?

445
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:51,299
I feel a lot better... I think I
just needed the fillings, you know.

446
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,420
Boss! Boss!

447
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:58,875
There's black stuff
coming out of your nose.

448
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,540
Jesus!

449
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:02,779
It's a silver cylinder. I can't find it.

450
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:06,935
We must find it. It contains the fluid.

451
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,660
It's not here.

452
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:13,695
It has to be. Keep looking.

453
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:31,035
We trade for ten thousand cans.

454
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,699
Certain factions of nigerian gangs

455
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,179
want to try and extract
weaponry from District 9.

456
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,899
And have been trying
to for many many years.

457
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,459
Give them one hundred cans.
- Hundred. -One hundred!

458
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:48,059
Yes, yes, but we take them all now.

459
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:53,070
Alright, boys! Get them the catfood
- hurry up.

460
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,379
And they amassed
thousands of these weapons.

461
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:59,259
Without the ability to use them.

462
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:02,339
Fuck off! Go! Hey friend,
not you. You stay here.

463
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:06,459
- What do you want from me?
- I just want to talk.

464
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,780
Talk about what?

465
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,739
Stupid prawn. They'll believe anything.

466
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,539
Muti is a South African word.

467
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:18,179
Today it's synonymous with
witchdoctory and magic.

468
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:22,139
You cut it here. This is their heart.

469
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,939
Cures high blood when you boil it,

470
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:28,660
cures sugar, diabetes, all diseases.

471
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:33,499
The nigerians were
consuming alien body parts.

472
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:37,579
They believed that by doing so,
they were ingesting their power

473
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,260
to use alien weaponry.

474
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,980
You must eat them.

475
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:47,315
And their power will live in you.

476
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:57,300
Just give me a fucking chance
to go in front of you, man!

477
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:06,379
Oh, baby! -Hi baby, come in! -I
need to get to the toilet, quickly!

478
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,699
Why? What's the matter?

479
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:14,700
Baby, listen. I might have
crapped in my pants. -Surprise!

480
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:20,259
What's this for? -Your promotion.
- All right, my promotion!

481
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:23,779
Hello, dad. How is it going?
Hi mom. -Good to see you.

482
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:27,459
What a surprise, man!
- Congratulations. -Thanks.

483
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:30,259
Congratulations, boss. -Thank you.

484
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:33,459
- Wikus, what happened?
- I had a small incident, baby.

485
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:36,859
I'm just gonna go to the toilet,
and then I'll talk to people, okay?

486
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,699
I need to talk to you. Come with
me. -Okay, but I just gotta...

487
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,179
Guys, can you give us a moment, please?

488
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,539
What happened out there?

489
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:48,539
This prawn wouldn't listen to
me, one really unruly prawn...

490
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:51,859
and I just had to...
get him in my grasp.

491
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,859
Listen to me, too many
aliens died out there today.

492
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,419
UYO is all over my backside.

493
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:00,819
Focus! you're not going
to fuck this up for me!

494
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:06,460
If you can't do the job,
I'll find someone who can!

495
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,579
Hi there! -Nice to see you again.

496
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:14,299
Does this mean he's in
charge of this new operation?

497
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,450
- Yes.
- That's nice.

498
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,580
Wikus! Baby are you okay?

499
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:32,480
Okay, let's cut some cake.

500
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:07,355
<i>Doctor Smith, please come
to room 405, doctor Smith.</i>

501
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:14,619
Is it badly infected?
- There's a lot of suppuration.

502
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:18,539
Also you should know on my right hand
some fingernails were coming loose.

503
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:24,540
And I had a black fluid coming out
of my nose, and sort of a black vomit.

504
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:28,899
What is happening to my arm, doctor?

505
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,020
What is this thing?

506
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,299
Just breathe deeply.
Calm down. Stay calm.

507
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,180
Sir, please tell my wife.

508
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:46,920
<i>Attention all medical
containment evacuate ward 11.</i>

509
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,939
Stop right there, madam.

510
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:10,579
What's going on? What
are you doing to him?

511
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:13,100
Let me through!

512
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:18,165
Wikus! Wikus! Where are you taking him?

513
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:37,535
Okay, got him? Are you ready? -Got him.

514
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:44,419
We decided not to use the anesthetic,

515
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:50,420
the reason being we can't know
how the subject will react.

516
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:04,099
Doctor Fester! -Yes? -I
think you should see this.

517
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:09,545
I found it in his jacket.
You think this is alien?

518
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,790
Stop, it's freezing! Fuck!

519
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,780
16 HOURS AFTER EXPOSURE

520
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,780
Where is this?

521
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,180
What?

522
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:39,560
What are they doing to these prawns?

523
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:44,610
Pain threshold, test one, DBX 7.

524
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:55,419
That's a strong pain reaction.
That means the nerves have fused.

525
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:58,619
I mean, it's almost
completely integrated.

526
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,820
Okay, do it.

527
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,860
B5. Testing AMR-B5.

528
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:09,770
Clear the range. Now, quickly!

529
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,180
Swing it around.

530
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:17,179
What are you doing?
- The door is locked.

531
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,579
Can you grip that? -What is this?

532
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:22,219
- Put it through.
- Why are you doing this?

533
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:26,339
- Standby for fire. Standby.
- You want me to shoot that?

534
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,940
Stand back... and fire!

535
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,780
That's good!

536
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,020
It worked!

537
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,279
All right, thanks very much.

538
00:38:39,314 --> 00:38:41,859
Do you know where my wife is?

539
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:46,830
Do you know if my wife
knows where I am, sir?

540
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,540
Pull! Pull!

541
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,739
No sir, I will not pull.

542
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:55,179
What did you say about
your wife? Fuck your wife!

543
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:57,700
Pull! -I will not pull.

544
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,460
Fire!

545
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:09,055
B7. -I can pull it.
- He says he can pull it.

546
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:15,615
I said I could pull it! You fuckin'...!

547
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,620
B21.

548
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,025
Move, hurry up. Move!

549
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:27,099
Right, we want him in the center
by the chain. -Get this off me.

550
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,250
Come on! Time, time!

551
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:33,179
Leave that fucking prawn, man, I
will shoot at pig. I'll shoot, sir!

552
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:36,379
Listen, I'll shoot at pig again
for you. I'll pull the trigger.

553
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:39,859
But I'm not shooting at prawn,
you hear me? Untie the fucking gun.

554
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:43,779
B21 in human hand.
That's good. It worked.

555
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:47,219
Just untie the gun, sir. -Stand by.

556
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:51,779
Listen, you can't use the real
guy, he didn't do anything to you.

557
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:56,315
I want to try this.
Everybody standing by.

558
00:39:56,540 --> 00:40:00,075
Ready to go? Three, two, one, go!

559
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,660
Amazing!

560
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:13,890
All right! I think that's all we need.

561
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,579
Gentlemen, we are running out of time.

562
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:20,739
This is the key stage
in the metamorphosis.

563
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:24,259
His DNA is in perfect balance
between alien and human.

564
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:27,299
And a problem is, as
the infection spreads,

565
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,259
the transition becomes
permanent and less active.

566
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:33,059
He's going to turn into
one of them. A prawn!

567
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,139
What happens to him isn't important.

568
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:39,379
What's important is that we harvest
from him what we can right now.

569
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:42,579
This body represents
hundreds of millions,

570
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:46,019
maybe billions of dollars
worth of biotechnology.

571
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:49,379
There are people out there,
governments, corporations,

572
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:52,295
who'd kill for this chance.

573
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:55,819
Will he survive the
procedure? -No, of course not.

574
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:59,659
We need everything.
Tissue, bone marrow, blood.

575
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:03,339
The procedure is gonna basically
strip him down to nothing. -Please...

576
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:05,619
What about next of kin?

577
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:08,419
Please help me. Don't let them do it.

578
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,740
I'll handle that.

579
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:15,905
Okay, I say let's go. -Good, thank you.

580
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,020
I don't understand.

581
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:34,220
None of this makes any sense.
He just hurt his arm, dad.

582
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:38,099
The doctors are trying, sweetheart.

583
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:41,205
Doing their best to save him.

584
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,939
We're starting to harvest
material from the specimen.

585
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,899
We'll start with the soft tissue
first. Cut through the chest cavern.

586
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,859
We need to get the heart
out as quickly as possible.

587
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:55,395
Once it set the
sinuosity, it just spread.

588
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:01,660
You know Wikus. He
never was very strong.

589
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:05,579
I'll go through the chest,
go straight into the heart.

590
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,899
Be quiet, please. -Fuck you!

591
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,100
Can I see him?

592
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:14,180
Not a good idea.

593
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,420
Fuck off! Fuck you!

594
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,420
Fuck you!

595
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:40,180
Drop the knife!

596
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:43,259
Move or I'll fuckin' cut his throat!

597
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,380
Okay. All right!

598
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,250
I'll fuckin' kill him!

599
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:02,120
You need to let go of him now.

600
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:09,235
It's okay, Tania.
Everything will be okay.

601
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,700
Smith.

602
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,700
When?

603
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,180
Get Koobus.

604
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,499
<i>...Wikus Van De Merwe.</i>

605
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:08,139
<i>White male, mid thirties. Is
considered highly dangerous.</i>

606
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:11,339
- Hey baby.
- Wikus, is that you?

607
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:13,659
- Mrs. Smith?
- How dare you phone us!

608
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:16,699
What are all these people doing in
my house? -It's none of your business.

609
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,739
I need to speak to Tania straight
away, please. It's my house.

610
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:23,099
This is my phone that you're
using, mam. I'm fokkin'... what?

611
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:25,260
He tried calling me.

612
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:28,339
Anton, it's me! It's
me! Accept the call!

613
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:32,059
I've been friends with you
for fokkin' 13 years, man!

614
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:34,979
Fuck off! What are
you watching? Fuck off!

615
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:37,939
We all thought it was for the
best because he needed help.

616
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:39,939
A special medical help.

617
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:44,670
And he wasn't gonna
get that as a fugitive.

618
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:53,920
He became the most valuable
business artifact on Earth.

619
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:57,179
He was the only human who had ever...

620
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:01,339
successfully been combined with
alien genetics and remained alive.

621
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:07,340
But his real value was that he
could operate alien weaponry.

622
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:14,540
Hello.

623
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:18,419
Can I get some cheese burgers
and one large sauerkraut, please.

628

Hi, this is Tania. -And Wikus.

640
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:13,219
We can't come to the phone right now.

641

<i>Control, there's no

643
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:00,880
The entire world was watching him.

644
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:05,339
He was on every radio station,
every image on television,

645
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:08,339
anything you could
find had his face on it.

646
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:12,299
So he had nowhere else to go. He
ended up hiding in the one place

647
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:17,410
he knew no one would
ever come looking for him.

648
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:08,660

Yes, have you got a

655
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:56,859

656
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:59,179
Which one do you want? Goat?

657
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:02,419
Come on, come on, I
don't have the whole day.

658
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:05,499
Is that a cat food
there? -Yeah, yeah, it is.

659
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:08,655
I'll have some of that, guys.

660
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:30,060
Fuck, man!

661
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,820
Hello, hello?

662
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:57,660
Baby is that you? Tania?

663
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:01,160
God, please let it be you.

664
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:03,300
Yes, it's me.

665
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:07,299
I'm so happy you called me, baby.

666
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:10,540
Wikus, listen to me. -Okay.

667
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:15,379
I have something to say to
you, and it's not gonna be easy.

668
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:18,419
No, no, look... listen baby,
before you say anything...

669
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:22,459
Your father is working against
me, but he's lying to you.

670
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:25,419
I did not have sex with one of these...

671
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:27,659
...fokkin' creatures, man!

672
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:29,979
I would never have any kind of

673
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:32,899
pornographic activity
with a fokkin' creature!

674
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:38,299
They say that you're becoming
one of them. I can't do this...

675
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:41,299
Baby please, don't give up on me.

676
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:44,619
Don't give up on me
baby, because I can...

677
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:47,299
I want to see you again, baby.

678
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:50,219
I'm gonna fix my arm and
I'm gonna see you again,

679
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:53,179
and I'm gonna kiss you and
I'm gonna hold you again.

680
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:56,765
I also want you to hold me again.

681
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:00,340
Baby?

682
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:03,900
Baby?

683
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:19,180
Hey! Hey man!

684
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:40,660
Okay...

685
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:07,659
<i>We are on tracking
directly to the location.</i>

686
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:13,660
<i>Roger that. I'll send you a
couple of choppers for backup.</i>

687
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:31,460
You!

688
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:34,140
What do you want?

689
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:41,099
<i>Come in, control, there
is our target moving to 66.</i>

690
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:45,780
- You have to go.
- Please, I need your help.

691
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:49,739
We're gonna play hide and
seek. -Yes! Yes! -No, get back.

692
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:53,219
You want me to hide? Show me
your favorite hiding place.

693
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:57,060
Please, just go. Leave us alone.

694
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:00,575
No, please, I need to hide.

695
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:03,340
They wanna kill me.

696
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:09,295
I just need to hide in here,
sir, for 5 minutes, okay?

697
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:20,139
What is this? What are you doing here?

698
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:23,099
I remember you. -Nothing.
You must hide somewhere else.

699
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,539
Sir... please sir, you have to help me.

700
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:30,365
I'm losing blood,
they're trying to kill me.

701
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:42,819
Only one thing that
could make that happen...

702
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:46,260
Quick! We have to hide him.

703
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:51,630
Now you... get down there.

704
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:07,259
Where's the fluid?
What did you do with it?

705
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:09,139
- Please!
- You took it...

706
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:11,139
I don't know what you're talking about!

707
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:14,979
...I know you did. I can
see what's happening to you.

708
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:17,500
Tell me where it is.

709
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:20,940
Alright, alright.

710
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:24,459
Was it a black fluid
in a flask container?

711
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:26,740
Yes, that's it. Yes!

712
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:30,419
I confiscated it and the
guys at the lab took it.

713
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:34,150
It will be at the MNU. MNU has it.

714
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:44,740
What is this?

715
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:49,010
- You ruined everything.
- Where is this?

716
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,300
Is that your shack?

717
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,459
This whole thing is under your shack?

718
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:02,019
For 20 years you've... had
this fokking' thing in here?

719
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:04,659
Jesus, this is very illegal.

720
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:10,660
I mean, this is a find, you know.
I wish they catch you with this.

721
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,300
Fuel goes in here.

722
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:16,820
That's enough! Quiet!

723
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,020
Then we fly away.

724
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:21,579
I said quiet! We cannot trust him.

725
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:25,499
What is he saying about the fuel?
Are you trying to start this thing?

726
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,739
Are you little fuckers trying
to start this and get away?

727
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:30,660
Never mind.

728
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:33,099
Yeah, you sneaky fokkin' prawns.

729
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:35,899
Too bad. I could've fixed you.

730
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:39,779
What? What did you
say... about the fixing?

731
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:42,139
What do you mean you could fix me?

732
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:45,299
Forget it. It doesn't
matter, it's too late.

733
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,299
No, listen! Listen. Are
you saying that you can...

734
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,939
turn this prawn hand into a human hand?

735
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:53,219
You can make me human again?

736
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:57,339
We have medical machines on the
mothership that can fix you. Yes.

737
00:55:57,340 --> 00:56:01,259
We can use this ship to fly up there.

738
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:03,859
That's fantastic! You
guys are brilliant!

739
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:07,219
I always thought that prawns
were intelligent. Let's do it.

740
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:09,340
I don't have fluid.

741
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:14,179
I could fix you and I could fly
away. But I don't have fluid.

742
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:16,140
Right, okay.

743
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:18,739
All right, I tell you
what. Why don't we...

744
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:21,819
go risk it some more?
Let's go collect some up.

745
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:26,059
It took twenty years
to collect that amount.

746
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:28,500
Fuck, man! Fuck!

747
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:32,419
Fuck! The only one that exists
is the one I confiscated?

748
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:34,140
Yes.

749
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:37,450
It's four stories underground.

750
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:46,739
Why does he keep looking at
me like that? -He likes you.

751
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:48,860
We are the same.

752
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:55,380
We're not the same. We're
not the fokkin' same.

753
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:06,460
There is a way out of this.
We get the fluid back from MNU.

754
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:10,419
Yeah, and what then?
Then we both die, eh?

755
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:13,299
Both of us dead. That's
a suicide mission, man.

756
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:17,739
Can you not fill my head
with that sort of nonsense?

757
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:21,315
The transformation is accelerating.

758
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:25,620
You don't have much time.

759
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:52,020
56 HOURS AFTER EXPOSURE

760
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:17,180
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

761
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,820
Hello.

762
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:44,780
- Wikus?
- Tania! Baby...

763
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:48,499
- Are you okay?
- Oh God! Thank God...

764
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,780
Where are you?

765
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:52,900
I'am...

766
00:58:54,300 --> 00:59:00,300
It's not like my father said. I
know he was lying to protect me.

767
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:03,619
I just don't know what
to believe anymore.

768
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:06,019
Baby I know, but listen to me.

769
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:10,939
It's all lies, I swear to you.
Everything he said to you is lies.

770
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:14,020
- I know.
- What? What?

771
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:18,099
I believe you, Wikus.
I just want you back.

772
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:21,059
I want everything back the way it was.

773
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:23,979
That's... baby, that's what I want.

774
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:26,779
That's great! That's great news.

775
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:30,779
I can make it the way it
was. If you take me back.

776
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:34,100
How? How can we go back?

777
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:40,859
I have a plan. I know how to fix it.

778
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:43,339
I know how to fix myself.

779
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:46,419
And it will be me. And
we'll be back together.

780
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:50,525
- You promise me?
- I promise you, baby.

781
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:53,099
Don't give up on me, okay?

782
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:56,419
Because I haven't given
up on you. All right?

783
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:58,460
I won't.

784
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:01,790
- I love you.
- I love you too.

785
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:07,510
Tell me you got a fix on him. -D9.

786
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:17,520
How many moons does our planet have?

787
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:23,180
Seven.

788
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:27,500
This planet only has one.

789
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:32,379
I can't wait to see our planet.
It's bigger than this one, isn't it?

790
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:34,460
Enough.

791
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:37,580
We go home now?

792
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:41,300
Not home. No.

793
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:45,380
This is where we must go.

794
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:50,819
See that tent there? That might be ours.

795
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:53,580
I want to go home!

796
01:00:54,740 --> 01:01:00,380
We can't go home. Not anymore.

797
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:09,619
Hi, you don't wanna go to the
tents, they are not better.

798
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:11,939
They're smaller than the shacks.

799
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:14,739
Actually, more like
a concentration camp.

800
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:19,059
If I can get you that black
fluid, what happens then?

801
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:21,659
We go up to the mothership.

802
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:25,385
And you can start that thing? -Yes.

803
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:31,040
Okay, so just to be clear:
this is gonna go back...

804
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:36,019
This is gonna go back
to human like this.

805
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:39,219
I can go home and then you can go home.

806
01:01:39,220 --> 01:01:42,059
You can take your boy, you
can take all the prawns,

807
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:44,459
if I can get you that fluid, right?

808
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:49,859
You said it was a suicide
mission. Maybe you were right.

809
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:54,875
We have no weapons.
They'll shoot us on sight.

810
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:57,939
Look, look... Christopher...

811
01:01:57,940 --> 01:02:01,380
I know where we can get weapons.

812
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:10,780
Hi guys. Hello.

813
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:16,659
I would like to buy
some weapons, please.

814
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:19,910
How did you do this like that?

815
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:23,099
A doggie style with the demon.

816
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:25,100
I love it!

817
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:29,619
One brave white man, eh?
Were you wearing a condom?

818
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:32,820
I need to buy weapons, please.

819
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:37,179
You and I both know that there
are illegal weapons inside here.

820
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:42,960
I have money and I would
like to buy some of those...

821
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:50,420
Sit!

822
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:08,979
Thank you sir for your time.
Thank you very much for seeing me.

823
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:12,099
I would like to buy some weapons.

824
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:16,019
AK-47, some grenades...
maybe tear gas canisters.

825
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:19,099
I see you have limpet
mines here aswell, and I..

826
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:23,099
also see you guys have alien
weapons there, which is great!

827
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:25,939
If I could have one or two of those.

828
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:29,285
I have money, okay? Now, I'm...

829
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:35,980
Sir! Please, sir!

830
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:38,419
I've heard about you.

831
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:41,499
Where do you have it? Show me!

832
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,260
Oh, shit!

833
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:46,180
Come here. Come.

834
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:54,460
No, no... don't please!

835
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:03,179
Why are you doing
this? What do you want?

836
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:05,100
Shut up!

837
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:11,299
Forget the weapons! Forget the weapons!

838
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:14,265
I want the arm. Cut it off.

839
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:17,260
What is he saying?

840
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:29,660
I'll show you.

841
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:35,300
Holy shit!

842
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:42,550
You tell them to stand down!

843
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:50,985
You tell them to be quiet! To back off!

844
01:04:51,980 --> 01:04:55,379
Tell them to put the
fokkin' weapons in the bag!

845
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:58,865
Give me the fokkin' weapons, man!

846
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:01,659
Don't you, sir, look at me.

847
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:05,150
I said don't fokkin' look at me!

848
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:12,200
How did you get that hand?

849
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:14,899
Fokkin' hurry up there!

850
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:18,099
Look at me when I fuckin' speak
to you. What is your secret?

851
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:20,825
What did you do? Tell me!

852
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:25,259
I want that fuckin' arm.
What the fuck did you do?

853
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:27,899
You fuckin' mazungo, I'm coming for you!

854
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:31,059
I'm coming for you
and I'm gonna get you!

855
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:36,260
Drop your fokkin' knife.
Drop your fokkin' knife!

856
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:46,539
He's useless to us
dead. -Would you relax?

857
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:50,259
For fuck's sakes, my men have
done this a hundred times before.

858
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:54,125
<i>Maintaining a visual on the location.</i>

859
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:57,779
It's gonna be quick.

860
01:05:57,780 --> 01:05:59,980
It's gonna be clean.

861
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:04,445
Best of all, it's gonna be quiet.

862
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:10,810
Van De Merwe hasn't got a
clue what's coming his way.

863
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:14,550
It's empty! -Where are they?

864
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:17,579
Target is gone. The place is empty.

865
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:20,579
What do you mean, empty?
Where the fuck is he?

866
01:06:20,580 --> 01:06:24,019
That little shithead has got
no idea what is coming his way.

867
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:26,300
I'm gonna find him.

868
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:40,700
There are the guards! At the gate!
Watch the guards at the gate, man!

869
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:47,300
Move! Get out!

870
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:55,259
They're going down. Four stories down.

871
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:59,379
This is alien weaponry.
Give me a status report.

872
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:01,779
It's Van De Merwe. He's on level four.

873
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:04,459
Switch to live, and then
we're taking him out.

874
01:07:04,460 --> 01:07:07,419
Colonel, we weren't allowed
to use live ammunition.

875
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:09,980
They want him alive.

876
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:16,459
Stay here until I call
you. -I understand.

877
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:19,520
I need to get the door open.

878
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:23,605
No! I said stay until I call you!

879
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:30,380
Fuck!

880
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:34,339
I thought you said not to kill them?

881
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:36,620
He shot at me!

882
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,859
Fuck! Get out! Don't fuckin' look at me!

883
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:43,680
Get out! Get the fuck out!

884
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:59,619
Get out! Everybody get the fuck out!

885
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:01,940
Get out! Go!

886
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:04,820
Move the fuck out! Go!

887
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:09,339
What is this place?
- Don't worry about that.

888
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:12,220
What do they do in here?

889
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:15,940
Check these boxes.

890
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:19,859
Any type of a box that looks like it
can hold a tube. Just check it out!

891
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:21,980
These fuckers!

892
01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:26,860
Go, go, go...

893
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:30,620
Clear.

894
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:38,860
I got it! I got it!

895
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:44,730
Chris, I got it. Let's go!

896
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:47,900
Christopher!

897
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:52,660
Oh, fuck!

898
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:56,499
Listen... I promise you, I
didn't know they were doing this.

899
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:59,339
Until they brought
me here the other day,

900
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:02,539
I swear to you I did not know
they were doing this to you guys.

901
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:05,459
But Christopher... look
at me. Listen to me.

902
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:08,179
We need to leave now. Okay?

903
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:10,939
The whole of MNU is
gonna come down here.

904
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:13,665
He's going to destroy us.

905
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:18,379
We can do this, okay? We're
gonna get out of here...

906
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:20,020
Fire!

907
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:22,780
Move, move!

908
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:26,740
Shoot at the prawn!

909
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:39,930
Christopher! What the
fuck are you doing?

910
01:09:45,820 --> 01:09:49,355
Think of your boy, for fuck sake!

911
01:09:57,020 --> 01:10:03,019
What the hell are you doing?
Are you out of your fuckin' mind?

912
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:08,180
You're gonna get us
killed! -What do we do now?

913
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:11,899
I thought you had a way out?

914
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:14,299
I didn't say anything about the way out.

915
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:17,539
I promised you that we'll get
in. We're in! -I have an idea.

916
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:21,120
- Where are you going?
- Follow me!

917
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:28,099
What are you doing? -Making a bomb.

918
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:30,020
Let's go!

919
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:44,420
Quick! Get in!

920
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:47,300
Go! Drive!

921
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:49,780
Okay!

922
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:53,700
Okay, hold on!

923
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:56,500
Fuck!

924
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:05,579
Reports are coming in of
explosion in downtown Johannesburg.

925
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:07,979
Well, there was a terrorist attack,

926
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:13,659
but I can assure you that we
dealt with it. Everything is fine.

927
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:17,670
Droop it down! Droop it down! Decline!

928
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:28,380
They are really close to us now!

929
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:32,620
Shit!

930
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:39,215
Let's go, let's go!

931
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:43,860
Don't drop that fokkin' thing!

932
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:53,939
Come on, move! Get down there!

933
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:58,330
Go down and initiate
the binary commands.

934
01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:01,810
Set it down right now!

935
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:05,019
When we get up to the mothership,
how long is this gonna take?

936
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:07,619
- To do what?
- The fixing. To fix me.

937
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:10,419
It's going to take a bit
longer than I thought.

938
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:12,619
Okay, that's fine. How long do you need?

939
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:14,740
Three years.

940
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:17,659
Sorry, just go slowly
with the clicks there,

941
01:12:17,660 --> 01:12:21,059
it sounded like you said
"three years", like human years.

942
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:23,580
Yes. Three years.

943
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:26,579
What? Three fuckin' years?

944
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:29,300
I will fix you,

945
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:32,819
but first I must save my people.

946
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:35,939
The deal was: you go home, I get fixed!

947
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:39,979
I will not let my people
be medical experiments!

948
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:42,739
I'm a fokkin' medical experiment!
You hear me, Christopher?

949
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:45,259
I'm a fokkin' medical experiment, man!

950
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:48,019
I must go home and get help.

951
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:52,179
I must use all the
fluid to travel quickly.

952
01:12:52,180 --> 01:12:56,419
I'll just stay here, Christopher?
I'll just stay here in this shack.

953
01:12:56,420 --> 01:13:00,099
And I'll see you in three years
time? -I will come back. I promise.

954
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:01,940
Christopher!

955
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:25,380
Where the fuck is he?

956
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:30,859
Hey, you're hiding
Wikus down there, my boy?

957
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:33,340
- Father?
- No, no, no.

958
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:37,579
Your daddy needs to stay here to
sort out a few things, alright?

959
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:43,580
We're gonna go. We're gonna
come back and fetch him, okay?

960
01:13:44,540 --> 01:13:47,659
In here? -In there.
- Goes in here?

961
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:51,625
How the fuck do you open this, prawn?

962
01:13:53,140 --> 01:13:54,900
Father.

963
01:13:55,660 --> 01:13:59,179
Show me, you fucker. You
want me to fuckin' kill you?

964
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:02,810
Is that what you fuckin' want, eh?

965
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:20,299
Right... there's no buttons.

966
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:21,820
On!

967
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:23,940
Activate?

968
01:14:24,140 --> 01:14:26,575
My teachers teach only:

969
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:29,020
One prawn, one bullet.

970
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:38,339
I can't believe I get paid to do this.

971
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:41,635
I love watching you prawns die.

972
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:45,780
Fuck, man!

973
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:56,540
Father!

974
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:02,500
Get out! Get out!

975
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:11,345
This is remarkable.

976
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:14,379
It looks like something is
emerging from the ground.

977
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:17,699
Something is definitely
coming out of the ground.

978
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:19,620
Okay... steady!

979
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:29,499
Go sit down, I can't play with ya now.

980
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:32,180
Uncle Wikus is flying.

981
01:15:32,980 --> 01:15:35,460
Bug off. Bug off!

982
01:15:41,380 --> 01:15:44,150
Lock the weapon at target!

983
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:46,740
Fire when locked.

984
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:52,459
It seems to be drifting towards
the center of the territory.

985
01:15:52,460 --> 01:15:55,615
We have a lock on him. -Fire!

986
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:59,339
Something is fired
upon... it has been hit!

987
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:01,339
What the fuck is that?

988
01:16:01,340 --> 01:16:04,339
One of the engines is billowing
smoke, it's out of control.

989
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:10,340
It's going down, boss. Should
I send the boys to fuck him up?

990
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:14,939
Now... it hit the ground,
the massive impact,

991
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:18,190
and it's come to a standstill.

992
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:25,580
My son! My son's in there!

993
01:16:25,780 --> 01:16:28,619
Shut the fuck up! Get
this fucker inside.

994
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:32,539
We're moving out. Come,
let's go, let's go...

995
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:34,100
Move!

996
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:37,939
We're banking around now, trying
to get a better view of the ship

997
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:43,940
which is absolutely wrecked, waiting
for some of the smoke to clear.

998
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:44,539
Somebody has been brought
out of the vehicle.

999
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:46,739
It looks like a human being.

1000
01:17:46,740 --> 01:17:49,499
We are getting unconfirmed
reports that this might be

1001
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:52,379
Wikus Van De Merwe, a fugitive
that has been on the run

1002
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:54,779
from MNU for the past 3 days.

1003
01:17:54,780 --> 01:18:00,780
They are loading him into a
vehicle now, and heading off.

1004
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:04,060
72 HOURS AFTER EXPOSURE

1005
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:26,700
What the fuck?

1006
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:42,960
We caught him, boss. -Bring him to me.

1007
01:18:58,180 --> 01:19:00,380
Come on! Get back!

1008
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:03,620
Oh, fuck!

1009
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:15,100
Control, we're taking enemy fire!
We need support. Backup, now!

1010
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:20,880
Fuck off! Fuck off, man!

1011
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:35,030
Get you hands off me!
Fuckin' get off me!

1012
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:40,260
Get your fuckin' hands off me!

1013
01:20:15,180 --> 01:20:18,739
Didn't I tell you...
that I'm gonna get you?

1014
01:20:18,740 --> 01:20:23,819
You came in here and you left
with something that belongs to me.

1015
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:25,900
Fuck you.

1016
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:35,380
Fuck you all!

1017
01:21:13,180 --> 01:21:16,739
I told you that the day will come.

1018
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:20,419
You've been running
around with my prize.

1019
01:21:20,420 --> 01:21:24,339
All I want is to eat that
hand and become like you.

1020
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:26,700
No! It won't work...

1021
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:33,819
Once I have that power,
no one will stop me.

1022
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:37,500
It was your turn... now it's mine!

1023
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:46,060
Fighting MNU security forces,
this armed faction is doomed...

1024
01:21:48,260 --> 01:21:51,740
Now I'm gonna eat, my friend.

1025
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:17,420
We're getting reports claiming that
the alien device is activating...

1026
01:24:12,740 --> 01:24:16,539
You see that prawn back
in the Casper? -Yeah.

1027
01:24:16,540 --> 01:24:19,619
He knows what the fuck
is up with that ship.

1028
01:24:19,620 --> 01:24:24,490
Get that fucker out and
get him talking, now.

1029
01:24:34,380 --> 01:24:40,339
Three contractors are closing in
on the nigerian compound, and...

1030
01:24:40,340 --> 01:24:42,780
Come, alien!

1031
01:24:52,820 --> 01:24:55,300
What's your plan?

1032
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:20,140
How are you doing it?

1033
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:22,785
Who's moving that ship?

1034
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:27,420
All right, that's very clever.

1035
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:37,540
Wait for my command. Make
sure you fuckin' shoot to kill.

1036
01:25:42,140 --> 01:25:44,625
Fuck! Move it! Move it!

1037
01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:48,500
Bring that fucker down!

1038
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:58,579
Hold you fire! Hold your
fire and keep your positions!

1039
01:25:58,580 --> 01:26:00,820
It's Van De Merwe.

1040
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:03,420
Hey, Dickus!

1041
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:20,019
I'll come back for prawn, alright guys?

1042
01:26:20,020 --> 01:26:22,219
Do you hear me, now? -Run, Wikus!

1043
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:24,380
- You hear me?
- Run!

1044
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:27,259
And keep on running, you fuckin' coward!

1045
01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:29,340
Run! Run!

1046
01:26:31,660 --> 01:26:37,660
Get the air support up, and
get on his fuckin' trail, now!

1047
01:26:38,220 --> 01:26:41,659
It's not gonna work,
boss. He's a tough one.

1048
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:46,960
He's not gonna talk. -Then
just fuckin' kill him.

1049
01:26:58,860 --> 01:27:01,659
<i>He's not gonna talk. -Then
just fuckin' kill him.</i>

1050
01:27:01,660 --> 01:27:03,180
Fuck!

1051
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:05,779
<i>He's a tough one. He's not gonna talk.</i>

1052
01:27:05,780 --> 01:27:08,645
<i>Then just fuckin' kill him.</i>

1053
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:33,499
Hey, c'mon. Get up! I'm
gonna get you out of here.

1054
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:37,299
- I can't... it's too far.
- It's not too fokkin' far. Get up!

1055
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:40,659
I'm gonna get you there. I'm
gonna get you to your boy!

1056
01:27:40,660 --> 01:27:43,060
C'mon, stay behind me!

1057
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:55,620
Go back!

1058
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:01,100
Run, run, run!

1059
01:28:05,820 --> 01:28:10,019
Arriving at the location now.
We have a clearance to engage.

1060
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:14,030
Prawns are coming, get down, get down!

1061
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:33,819
There are headed for a drop
site. Knock these fuckers off!

1062
01:28:33,820 --> 01:28:36,160
Come to mommy, come...

1063
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:41,020
Fuck!

1064
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:48,060
Shit!

1065
01:28:49,220 --> 01:28:51,180
Are you hurt?

1066
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:54,539
We can make it. I was shot in the arm.

1067
01:28:54,540 --> 01:28:57,170
We can make it, come on!

1068
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:15,379
Listen, you go ahead. You can make it.

1069
01:29:15,380 --> 01:29:19,179
I'm gonna just... hold them off
here, and I'll join you soon.

1070
01:29:19,180 --> 01:29:23,059
No, we stick together.
I'm not leaving you here.

1071
01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:26,019
Take your boy and go
home. You have to make it.

1072
01:29:26,020 --> 01:29:28,899
Don't make me go through
all of this and not make it.

1073
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:32,219
Do you understand? -I
will come back for you.

1074
01:29:32,220 --> 01:29:35,659
Go! Go now before I change my mind! Go!

1075
01:29:35,660 --> 01:29:38,300
Three years. I promise.

1076
01:30:02,660 --> 01:30:05,910
I'm not fuckin' scared of you!

1077
01:30:12,460 --> 01:30:14,780
Quit fuckin' with me!

1078
01:30:58,740 --> 01:31:01,465
You want me? You want me?

1079
01:31:05,740 --> 01:31:07,940
Is that all you got?

1080
01:31:09,220 --> 01:31:12,230
Is that all you fuckin' got?

1081
01:31:14,020 --> 01:31:17,859
Some kind of quite extraordinary
light from the mothership.

1082
01:31:17,860 --> 01:31:23,860
I've never seen anything like
it. It's a beam of light...

1083
01:31:28,020 --> 01:31:30,700
Full scan. Okay.

1084
01:31:34,180 --> 01:31:35,900
Fire!

1085
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:12,020
Get to the vehicle, now! Get
going. -Yes colonel. -Go, go, go!

1086
01:32:33,100 --> 01:32:34,820
Fuck!

1087
01:32:35,700 --> 01:32:38,579
Quit playing with me, Koobus!

1088
01:32:38,580 --> 01:32:40,700
You fucker!

1089
01:32:59,020 --> 01:33:01,540
Go, Chris, go.

1090
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:04,220
Go home.

1091
01:34:36,180 --> 01:34:38,860
We go home now?

1092
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:40,900
Yes.

1093
01:34:48,020 --> 01:34:51,460
74 HOURS AFTER EXPOSURE

1094
01:35:05,740 --> 01:35:07,660
Unbelievable.

1095
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:13,475
Now I know why everybody
wants a piece of you.

1096
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:17,659
I can't wait for those
med boys to cut you up.

1097
01:35:17,660 --> 01:35:19,780
But you know what?

1098
01:35:19,860 --> 01:35:22,859
You're not gonna waste
any more of my time.

1099
01:35:22,860 --> 01:35:25,965
You half-breed piece of shit!

1100
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:31,215
I'm gonna just fuckin' kill you myself.

1101
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:41,395
Stay back, you fuck! Stay back!

1102
01:35:43,380 --> 01:35:45,300
Stay back!

1103
01:37:07,380 --> 01:37:10,419
The people everywhere
across Johannesburg

1104
01:37:10,420 --> 01:37:13,619
are flooding the streets and
pouring out of their offices

1105
01:37:13,620 --> 01:37:17,739
and all eyes are pointed up towards
the sky on this momentous day.

1106
01:37:17,740 --> 01:37:21,299
It's the first time, ladies and
gentlemen, in over two decades,

1107
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:24,499
that the mothership has
shown any sign of movement,

1108
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:27,259
and people are tremendously excited.

1109
01:37:27,260 --> 01:37:30,419
The city had come to
an absolute standstill.

1110
01:37:30,420 --> 01:37:34,059
Everybody wants to know
what's going to happen next.

1111
01:37:34,060 --> 01:37:37,419
There's no way of knowing whether or
not Christopher Johnson will return.

1112
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:39,659
We don't know if he was simply escaping,

1113
01:37:39,660 --> 01:37:43,659
whether he will effect a rescue plan...

1114
01:37:43,660 --> 01:37:46,259
...and, as the so
called free press says,

1115
01:37:46,260 --> 01:37:52,260
whether or not he will come
back and declare a war on us.

1116
01:38:13,740 --> 01:38:17,939
This is the last known
footage of Wikus Van De Merwe.

1117
01:38:17,940 --> 01:38:23,139
And we can only speculate as
to what has happened to him.

1118
01:38:23,140 --> 01:38:26,779
The more zany conspiracy
theories state that

1119
01:38:26,780 --> 01:38:30,419
he's been captured by MNU
or by another government.

1120
01:38:30,420 --> 01:38:33,419
Or by perhaps some
shady government agency

1121
01:38:33,420 --> 01:38:36,299
and he's actually
being held in captivity.

1122
01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:39,179
If we knew where he was,
we would try and help him,

1123
01:38:39,180 --> 01:38:42,539
and that is the most difficult
part, not knowing where he is.

1124
01:38:42,540 --> 01:38:46,659
Wikus, sadly, is gone but
I'm the one who stays behind

1125
01:38:46,660 --> 01:38:50,779
with all the questions.
I can't give the answers.

1126
01:38:50,780 --> 01:38:55,099
He died in my mind a long
time ago. And that's that.

1127
01:38:55,100 --> 01:38:59,019
Wikus Van Der Merwe is a name
that will become very widely known

1128
01:38:59,020 --> 01:39:03,059
because of this pivotal role that
he played in this whole event.

1129
01:39:03,060 --> 01:39:06,619
He was an honest man, and he didn't
deserve any of what happened to him.

1130
01:39:06,620 --> 01:39:09,979
I mean, I know. I looked into a
computer system and I found stuff.

1131
01:39:09,980 --> 01:39:13,259
I mean, the whole data
was there, you know?

1132
01:39:13,260 --> 01:39:16,619
They didn't even do a
good job of hiding it.

1133
01:39:16,620 --> 01:39:19,779
<i>Fundiswa Mhlanga is
currently awaiting trial</i>

1134
01:39:19,780 --> 01:39:23,219
<i>for exposing MNU's illegal
genetic research program.</i>

1135
01:39:23,220 --> 01:39:25,980
<i>District 9 was demolished</i>

1136
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:29,259
<i>after the alien resettlement
operation was completed.</i>

1137
01:39:29,260 --> 01:39:33,099
<i>District 10 now houses 2.5 million
aliens and continues to grow...</i>

1138
01:39:33,100 --> 01:39:37,139
You guys haven't seen a picture of
my wife. Let me show you my wife.

1139
01:39:37,140 --> 01:39:39,339
She's my special angel.

1140
01:39:39,340 --> 01:39:42,299
She even looks like an angel
with veil, you want to see that?

1141
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:45,099
Look, you see, with the
white veil over the...

1142
01:39:45,100 --> 01:39:48,859
she even looks like an angel.
Everyone says that his wife is angel,

1143
01:39:48,860 --> 01:39:52,019
but this is a real angel that
you see there, on the cameras.

1144
01:39:52,020 --> 01:39:57,325
They won't put that in
the video, I don't think.

1145
01:39:59,580 --> 01:40:02,179
I found this at my front door.

1146
01:40:02,180 --> 01:40:06,219
As tho somebody had just left it there.

1147
01:40:06,220 --> 01:40:09,019
My friends say that I
should throw it away,

1148
01:40:09,020 --> 01:40:11,779
cause it's just a piece of rubbish.

1149
01:40:11,780 --> 01:40:15,819
That it couldn't possibly come from him.

1150
01:40:15,820 --> 01:40:18,140
I know it's true.
