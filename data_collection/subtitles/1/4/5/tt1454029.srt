1
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,471
I was born 1911, Chickasaw County,
Piedmont Plantation.

2
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,932
And did you know,
as a girl growing up,

3
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,513
that one day you'd be a maid?

4
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,970
Yes, ma'am, I did.

5
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:36,639
And you knew that because...

6
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:41,315
My mama was a maid.
My grandmama was a house slave.

7
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,482
House... slave.

8
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,615
Do you ever dream
of being something else?

9
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,792
What does it feel like
to raise a white child

10
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,750
when your own child's at home being
looked after by somebody else?

11
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,083
It feel...

12
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,856
I done raised 17 kids in my life.

13
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:23,315
Looking after white babies,
that's what I do.

14
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:26,401
Aibee, Aibee.

15
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,611
- Hi!
- Aibee!

16
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:32,870
I know how to get them babies to sleep,
stop crying and go in the toilet bow/

17
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:35,030
before their mamas even
get out of bed in the morning.

18
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,662
Babies like fat.

19
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,795
They like big fat legs, too.
That I know.

20
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:46,299
You is kind, you is smart...

21
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,711
...you is important.

22
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,346
- You is smart...
- Smart...

23
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:54,054
...you is kind...
- ...you is kind...

24
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:57,060
...you is important.
- ...you is important.

25
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,646
That's so good.

26
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,437
That's so good.

27
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:09,361
I work for the Leefolts
from eight to four; six days a week.

28
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:15,246
I make 95 cent an hour.
That comes to $182 every month.

29
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:21,836
I do all the cooking, cleaning, washing,
ironing and grocery shopping.

30
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,633
But mostly, I take care of Baby Girl.

31
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,088
And, Lord, I worry she gonna be fat.

32
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,756
Mae Mobley.

33
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,051
Ain 't going to be
no beauty queen either.

34
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,847
Aibileen, bridge club is in an hour.
Did you finish the chicken salad?

35
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,014
- Yes.
- Oh, and Hilly's deviled eggs.

36
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,854
- No paprika.
- Mm-hm.

37
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,821
Does this dress look homemade?

38
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,150
I reckon when you finish it won't.

39
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,740
Well, thank you.

40
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:59,907
Miss Leefolt still don't
pick Baby Girl up but once a day.

41
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,452
The birthing blues got hold
of Miss Leefolt pretty hard.

42
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,916
I done seen it happen plenty of times,

43
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,332
once babies start having
their own babies.

44
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,303
And the young
white ladies of Jackson...

45
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,098
...oh Lord, was they having babies.

46
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,062
But not Miss Skeeter.

47
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,060
No man and no babies.

48
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,096
- Morning.
- Hi.

49
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,356
- My name is Eugenia Phelan, and...
- Come on.

50
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,068
Eugenia Phelan, Mr. Blackly.

51
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,118
Shut the damn door.

52
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,750
I guarantee you, one day they're going
to figure out cigarettes will kill you.

53
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:28,287
OK, Miss Phelan,
let's see what you got.

54
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,543
editor.

55
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,588
Ole Miss Rebel Rouser. editor.

56
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:38,880
Double major.

57
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,057
editor.

58
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:45,058
- Damn, girl, don't you have fun?
- Is that important?

59
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,522
- Do you have any references?
- Yes.

60
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,192
Right here.

61
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,151
This...

62
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,032
This is a rejection letter.

63
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,740
Not exactly. See, Miss Stein thought...

64
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,575
Stein?

65
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,160
Elaine Stein, from Harper and Row
Publishing in New York.

66
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,540
Oh, Lord.

67
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,418
I'm gonna be a serious writer,
Mr. Blackly.

68
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,126
I applied for a job,
but Mrs. Stein thought...

69
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,836
She said no.

70
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,922
Well, until I gain some experience.

71
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,427
See? Says right there.

72
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:21,136
"Great potential. Gain some experience
and please apply again."

73
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,429
Oh, Christ. I guess you'll do.
Do you clean?

74
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,972
- I'm sorry. Clean?
- Clean.

75
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,516
Grab that basket.

76
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:35,479
Miss Myrna has gone
shit-house crazy on us.

77
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,114
She drunk hairspray or something.

78
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,526
I want you to read her past columns.

79
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,366
Then read these letters and you
answer them just like she would.

80
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,951
Nobody is gonna know
the damn difference.

81
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,116
You know who Miss Myrna is?

82
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,540
I read her articles all the time.

83
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:54,002
Articles? Miss Phelan,
it's a cleaning advice column.

84
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,963
Eight bucks a week.
Copy is due on Thursday.

85
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,799
Hello?

86
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:04,804
Lou Ann, honey, I can't talk right now.
I'm at work.

87
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:08,345
What? Shut that goddamn door.

88
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,030
Mama, we're late for bridge!

89
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,745
Miss Hilly was the first
of the babies to have a baby.

90
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,454
...Three...

91
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,336
And it must have come out of her like
the 11th Commandment,

92
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,748
'cause once Miss Hilly had a baby,

93
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,793
every girl at the bridge table
had to have one, too.

94
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,385
Minny, go get Mama!

95
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,427
Missus Walters,
you need help coming down?

96
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,062
- I'm down.
- Ooh.

97
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,599
- I been down.
- Give me a heart attack.

98
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:56,894
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Missus Walters.
Here, let me help you.

99
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,030
Take that off.
It's 98 degrees out there.

100
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,656
- Is it?
- Yes, ma'am.

101
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,488
Well, let's put my coat on then.

102
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,698
- Come on, Minny.
- All right.

103
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,328
- Here's your pocketbook.
- Thank you.

104
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,114
OK, let me get the pie.

105
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,749
Hold on, Missus Walters. Hold on.

106
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:18,006
Once Missus Walters' arteries went hard,
Miss Hilly moved her into her house

107
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,792
and fired the maid she had
to make room for Minny too.

108
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,930
See, Minny about the best cook
in Mississippi,

109
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,681
and Miss Hilly wanted her.

110
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,395
I lost my own boy, Treelore,
four years ago.

111
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,024
After that, I just didn't want
to live no more.

112
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,937
It took God and Minny
to get me through it.

113
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:45,443
Minn y my best friend.
Old lady like me lucky to have her.

114
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:54,581
After my boy died, a bitter seed
was planted inside of me.

115
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,539
And I just didn't feel
so accepting any more.

116
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,227
No.

117
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,731
You drunk up two glasses of grape juice.
I know you got to tee-tee.

118
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,812
No.

119
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,272
I'll give you two cookies if you go.

120
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,863
Mae Mobley, you're going!

121
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,244
Aibileen, the girls are
pulling up, and the table isn't set.

122
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,906
Mae Mobley go, Mama.

123
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,246
Get in your room right now.

124
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,995
Set out the dessert forks. Please.

125
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,301
Put Mama in a chair
before she breaks a hip.

126
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,554
I'm not deaf yet, Hilly.

127
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,010
Hey, girls.

128
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:55,680
Oh. Minny. Will you see if Aibileen
has some of that ambrosia?

129
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,769
Hold on. Those are Miss Hilly's.

130
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:06,065
She looks like the winning
horse at the Kentucky Derby.

131
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,233
All flowers and bows.

132
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,901
Got to have paprika on them.

133
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,615
Ooh.

134
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:15,157
Forgive me, Lord, but I'm gonna have
to kill that woman, Aibileen.

135
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:18,202
Now she gone to putting pencil marks
on my toilet paper.

136
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,079
- Did she?
- Mm-hm.

137
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:24,921
But I carry paper in from my own
damn house. That fool don't know.

138
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,930
Miss Leefolt got so much hairspray
on her head

139
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,307
she gonna blow us all up
if she light a cigarette.

140
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,310
And you know she will!

141
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,151
- You got some ambrosia?
- You know I do.

142
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,857
All right, I'll be back.

143
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,988
Minny, cord, girl.

144
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,737
Shut up.

145
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,411
The Guiding Light.

146
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,325
Hi, Missus Walters.

147
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,831
I'm watching my story.

148
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:02,750
OK.

149
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,664
Isn't it gorgeous?

150
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,832
Sorry I'm late.

151
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,132
You're home!

152
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,388
I missed you all, too.

153
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:18,016
Well, if it isn't "Long Haul" Skeeter.

154
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,397
We didn't ever think
you'd leave Ole Miss.

155
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,899
Well, it does take four years, Jolene.

156
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:27,814
I've got a great summer planned for you.

157
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,196
Great.

158
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,484
I went ahead and I picked up my black
dress from the cleaners this morning.

159
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,404
What?

160
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,828
- About supper club tonight.
- What?

161
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,791
Honey, Stuart had to cancel.

162
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,330
Again?

163
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,215
He got held up on the oil rig, Skeeter.

164
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,672
It's... It's offshore.

165
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:54,635
I'm starting to think this Stuart
is a figment of your imagination,

166
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,049
so just forget it.

167
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,101
I'm just gonna go get a plate.

168
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,478
- Shh!
- Sorry!

169
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,778
I got a job today.

170
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,490
At The Jackson Journal.

171
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,953
They'd be a fool not to hire you.

172
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:20,365
To Skeeter and her job.

173
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,283
Last stop till marriage.

174
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:23,663
Oh!

175
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,917
- It's for the Miss Myrna column.
- Hmm.

176
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,177
Elizabeth, can I talk to Aibileen?

177
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:36,093
Just to help me with some of the letters
till I get a knack for it.

178
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,017
My Aibileen?

179
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,349
Why can't you just
get Constantine to help?

180
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:50,027
Constantine quit us.

181
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,689
Oh, my gosh. Skeeter, I'm so sorry.

182
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:57,110
Anyway, I just, um... I don't really
know how to answer these letters.

183
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:01,577
Well, I mean, as long as it doesn't
interfere with her work.

184
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,582
I don't see why not.

185
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:12,792
Leefolt residence.

186
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,927
Hello. Is Elizabeth in?

187
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,555
She having bridge club right now.
May I take a message?

188
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:21,594
Yes, please tell her Celia Foote
called again.

189
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,478
I'll call back tomorrow.

190
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,685
- Yes, ma'am.
- Uh...

191
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:28,771
Miss?

192
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:33,279
I'm looking for some help at my house.
Do you know any maids looking?

193
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:34,610
No, ma'am.

194
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,275
OK. It's Celia Foote.

195
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:41,117
Emerson-684.
Bye now.

196
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,704
You scared the daylights out of me!

197
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:54,042
It is lunchtime,
and I am suddenly hungry.

198
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,464
Honestly!

199
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,145
Oh.

200
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:08,056
I'm still working on it, Aibileen.

201
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:12,985
Who was that on the phone?

202
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,238
Miss Celia Foote called again.

203
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,441
I've never called her back, Hilly.

204
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:22,241
She can't take a hint, can she?

205
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,996
Who's Celia Foote?

206
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:26,157
That tacky girl Johnny married.

207
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,167
From Sugar Ditch.

208
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:29,873
It could have been you, Hilly.

209
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:35,384
And live 30 minutes outside of town?
No, thank you.

210
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:40,468
Anyway, I ran into her at the beauty
parlor, and she had the nerve to ask

211
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,678
if she could help with
the Children's Benefit Ball.

212
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,014
Aren't we taking non-members?
The benefit has gotten so big.

213
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:49,272
Yes, but we're not telling her.

214
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,567
Thank you, Aibileen.

215
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,866
Hilly, I wish you'd just
go use the bathroom.

216
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,527
I'm fine.

217
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,445
Oh, she's just upset

218
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,365
because the nigra uses the guest bath
and so do we.

219
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,996
Aibileen, go check on Mae Mobley.

220
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,254
Yes, ma'am.

221
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,129
Just go use mine and Raleigh's.

222
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,966
If Aibileen uses the guest bath,
I'm sure she uses yours, too.

223
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,472
She does not.

224
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:26,601
Wouldn't you rather them
take their business outside?

225
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,847
Have you all seen the cover
of Life this week?

226
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,390
Jackie's never looked more regal.

227
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:35,356
Tell Raleigh every penny he spends
on a colored's bathroom

228
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:38,362
he'll get back in spades
when y'all sell.

229
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:43,910
it's just plain dangerous. They carry
different diseases than we do.

230
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:45,862
Pass.

231
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:49,157
That's why I've drafted
the Home Health Sanitation Initiative.

232
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,620
The what?

233
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,706
A disease-preventative bill

234
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:57,295
that requires every white home to have a
separate bathroom for the colored help.

235
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,510
It's been endorsed
by the White Citizens' Council.

236
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:07,517
Maybe we should just build you
a bathroom outside, Hilly.

237
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:11,179
You ought not to joke
about the colored situation.

238
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:15,187
I'll do whatever it takes
to protect our children.

239
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,936
Your lead, Elizabeth.

240
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,200
- Aibileen?
- Yes, ma'am.

241
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,292
Do you think you'd be willing to help me
with those Miss Myrna letters?

242
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,876
Miss Myrna get it wrong a lot of times.
Be good to get it right.

243
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,134
Thank you, Aibileen.

244
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,142
All that talk in there today...

245
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,804
Hilly's talk?

246
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,436
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

247
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,743
Is that Preacher Green's sermon?

248
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:08,995
Yes, ma'am, it is.

249
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:12,077
That reminds me so much of my maid,
Constantine.

250
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:16,745
I know Constantine.
We're in church circle together.

251
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,705
Have you seen her lately?

252
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,294
No, ma'am.

253
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,004
Did you know that she had quit us?

254
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,168
Quit?

255
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:27,635
I got home from school a week ago,
and my mama told me she had quit.

256
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:31,597
Back in March, she went to live with
her daughter, Rachel. In Chicago.

257
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,766
Did you hear that?
Do you have her phone number?

258
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,023
There you are, Skeeter.

259
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,519
Hilly wants you to put her initiative
in the League newsletter.

260
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:42,687
OK.

261
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:45,865
I'll be back tomorrow, Aibileen,

262
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,617
to get started on those
Miss Myrna letters.

263
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:49,948
Y'all make it quick.

264
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:52,455
Tomorrow is silver-polishing day. OK?

265
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,884
Hi, Jameso.

266
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,302
How you, Miss Eugenia?

267
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:17,388
Mama?

268
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:22,814
Mama.

269
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,313
Yoo-hoo.

270
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,165
Mama?

271
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:38,542
Back here, honey!

272
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,466
Is this a little too young?

273
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,127
That's a little too everything.

274
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,218
Oh, hell. You're right.

275
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:07,984
OK.

276
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,076
Much better.

277
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,447
Your daddy bought me this dress in '58.

278
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,040
Mama, I want to ask you
about Constantine.

279
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,918
Right after Ole Miss won the Sugar Bowl.
Come on. You try it on.

280
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,203
What really happened?

281
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,294
Skeeter, your mother is sick.
She wants to see you in this dress.

282
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:26,457
Unzip me.

283
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,172
Come on.

284
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:34,048
Did I tell you Fanny Peatrow
got engaged?

285
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,930
After she got that teller job,

286
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,141
her mother said she was swimming
in proposals.

287
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,180
Good for fair Fanny Peatrow.

288
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:44,601
Eugenia, your eggs are dying.
Would it kill you to go on a date?

289
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:49,447
Just show a little gumption.
Careful now, careful.

290
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,903
Oh, now look at this.

291
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,820
This dress is just precious on you.

292
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:59,991
Just take it in a little here.
Little there.

293
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:05,121
- Get your hair fixed.
- I got a job today.

294
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,288
Where?

295
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:09,050
Writing for The Jackson Journal.

296
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,674
Great.

297
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:15,594
You can write my obituary!

298
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:19,886
"Charlotte Phelan, dead!
Her daughter, still single."

299
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,555
Mother, would it really be so bad
if I never met a husband?

300
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:25,475
Skeeter! Skeeter!

301
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:27,939
Skeeter!

302
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,025
I need to ask you something.

303
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:42,788
I read the other day about how
some girls get unbalanced.

304
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:44,794
They start thinking these...

305
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,463
...unnatural thoughts.

306
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,965
Are you...

307
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:56,552
Do you, uh... find men attractive?

308
00:20:57,131 --> 00:21:01,932
Are you having unnatural thoughts
about girls or women?

309
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,771
Oh, my God.

310
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:09,606
Because this article says there's
a cure. A special root tea!

311
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:15,151
Mother, I want to be with girls as much
as you want to be with Jameso.

312
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,489
- Eugenia!
- Unless, of course, you do!

313
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,028
Oh!

314
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:24,625
Carlton's bringing Rebecca to dinner.
Try to look presentable!

315
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,082
What the hell you know
about cleaning a house, Skeeter?

316
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,967
It's a start, Carlton.

317
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,596
If you say so.
I thought you wanted to write books.

318
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:40,850
Now, y'all leave Sister alone.

319
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,887
- I'm proud of you, sweetheart.
- The irony of it all.

320
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:46,351
Giving advice on how to keep up a home
when she doesn't even...

321
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:49,939
Oh, no, Pascagoula. You couldn't have
known this, but I'm allergic to almonds.

322
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,819
Sorry, Miss Eugenia,
I'll get you another one.

323
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,527
You know, last time I had an almond,
I stopped liking men.

324
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,236
Oh, my Lord.

325
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:01,154
Oh, no, Rebecca, it's fine. There's
a special root tea for that now.

326
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,663
You have pushed it, young lady.

327
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:06,493
Daddy. What happened to Constantine?

328
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,957
Uh, well...

329
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:13,048
Constantine went to live in Chicago
with her family.

330
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:15,710
People move on, Skeeter.

331
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,254
But I do wish that she'd
stayed down here with us.

332
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:24,977
I don't believe you.

333
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,185
She would've written and told me.

334
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,151
Did you fire her?

335
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:44,948
We were just a job to her, honey.
With them, it's all about money.

336
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:48,618
You'll understand that once you've
hired help of your own.

337
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,254
- She raised me.
- She did not!

338
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:55,007
She worked here for 29 years!

339
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,384
It was a colored thing
and I put it behind me!

340
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:01,927
Excuse me a moment, Rebecca. My daughter
has upset my cancerous ulcers.

341
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,100
What you doing hiding out here, girl?

342
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:56,144
I couldn't tell Mama I didn't
get asked to the dance.

343
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,436
It's all right.

344
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:02,150
Some things we just got to
keep to ourselves, right?

345
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:05,076
All the boys say I'm ugly.

346
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:11,042
Mama was third runner-up in
the Miss South Carolina pageant.

347
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,875
I wish you'd quit
feeling sorry for yourself.

348
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:17,165
Now, that's ugly.

349
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:21,757
Ugly is something that
goes up inside you.

350
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,389
It's mean and hurtful, like them boys.

351
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,513
Now you're not one of them, is you?

352
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,474
I didn't think so, honey.

353
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:37,685
Every day...

354
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:42,486
Every day you're not
dead in the ground,

355
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:47,245
when you wake up in the morning, you're
gonna have to make some decisions.

356
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:51,119
Got to ask yourself this question:

357
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,417
"Am I gonna believe

358
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:58,251
all them bad things them fools
say about me today?"

359
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,299
You hear me?

360
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:04,587
"Am I gonna believe all them bad things

361
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,256
them fools say about me today'?"

362
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:11,260
All right?

363
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:18,276
As for your mama,
she didn't pick her life.

364
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:21,070
It picked her.

365
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:24,982
But you...

366
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:31,410
...you're gonna do
something big with yours.

367
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,124
You wait and see.

368
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:39,463
Come on, go home with me
till the dance over. Come on.

369
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,779
Miss Stein, you said in your letter
to write about what disturbs me,

370
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,234
particularly if it bothers no one else.

371
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,398
Come on.

372
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,363
And I understand that now.

373
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:10,949
Continue.

374
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:14,748
I'd like to write something
from the point of view of the help.

375
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,832
These colored women
raise white children,

376
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:22,294
and in 20 years,
those children become the boss.

377
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:25,175
We love them and they love us,

378
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:27,632
but they can't even use the toilets
in our houses.

379
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:29,388
Don't you find that ironic, Miss Stein?

380
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:30,547
I'm listening.

381
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,685
Margaret Mitchell glorified
the mammy figure,

382
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,516
who dedicates her whole life

383
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:37,725
to a white family.

384
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:41,267
But nobody ever asked Mammy
how she felt about it.

385
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,186
So, a side to this never before heard?

386
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:46,276
Yes.

387
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,282
'Cause nobody ever really
talks about it down here.

388
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:53,909
Skeeter, who are you
talking to in there?

389
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,290
Go away!

390
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,880
- Who was that?
- My mother.

391
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,585
Look.

392
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:08,218
No maid in her right mind is ever gonna
tell you the truth.

393
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:11,927
That's a hell of a risk to take in
a place like Jackson, Mississippi.

394
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:13,466
I already have a maid.

395
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,971
Really? A Negro maid has already agreed
to speak with you?

396
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,352
Yes, ma'am.

397
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:28,189
Well... I guess I can read
what you come up with.

398
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,528
The book biz could use
a little rattling.

399
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:32,068
Thank you, Miss Stein.

400
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:33,986
Hey, hey, hey, all I'm saying

401
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:37,123
is that I'll let you know
if it's even worth pursuing.

402
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:40,706
And for God's sake, you're
a 23-year-old educated woman.

403
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:43,041
Go get yourself an apartment.

404
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,047
"Dear Miss Myrna:

405
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:52,676
When I'm chopping onions, how do I
keep tears out of my eyes?"

406
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:56,433
Shoot, that's easy. You tell
her hold a matchstick between her teeth.

407
00:27:57,885 --> 00:27:59,432
Is it lit?

408
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:01,222
No, ma'am.

409
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:06,606
Miss Leefolt said
you could start right away.

410
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:11,740
Build it just like the bathroom
at my house. Let's see.

411
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:15,529
- Right there. That will be nice.
- Yes, ma'am.

412
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:23,377
My goodness, we got to run back
to the car. Come on.

413
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:25,288
Bye, Skeeter!

414
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,467
Aibileen.

415
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:34,256
There's something else I want to
write about. I would need your help.

416
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:41,520
I want to interview you about
what it's like to work as a maid.

417
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:44,978
I'd like to do a book of interviews
about working for white families.

418
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:49,528
And we could show what it's like
to work for, say, Elizabeth?

419
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,940
You know what Miss Leefolt do to me if
she knew I was telling stories on her?

420
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:56,235
I was thinking that we wouldn't
have to tell her.

421
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,280
The other maids would have
to keep it a secret, too.

422
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:00,789
Other maids?

423
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:04,619
I was hoping to get four or five.

424
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:09,294
To show what it's really like
in Jackson.

425
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:17,298
Show what y'all get paid,
and the babies and the bathrooms.

426
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:18,681
The good and the bad.

427
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,219
I bought you this damn house.
I put up with your new clothes

428
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:24,935
and trips to New Orleans,
but this takes the goddamn cake.

429
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,314
Hilly spoke to the surgeon general,

430
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:29,192
and she also said it'll add value
to our home.

431
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:32,195
I guess Mae Mobley can go to college
in that damn bathroom!

432
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:33,606
Hilly's covering the cost and said

433
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,615
you could just do William's taxes
to pay her back.

434
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,822
We don't take orders
from the Holbrooks.

435
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,614
Skeeter, how you doing?

436
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:45,075
Fine.

437
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,006
Fix me a sandwich, Aibileen.

438
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,587
Aibileen, Mae Mobley's
crying her eyes out.

439
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,426
Skeeter.

440
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,930
I'm sorry, but I think it's best
if you leave now.

441
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:07,894
Oh, sure, sure.

442
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:11,811
And this Miss Myrna thing isn't going
to work out with Aibileen.

443
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,738
I'm sorry.

444
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:28,874
You're making it hotter,
flapping your arms like that, Minny.

445
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,764
Look how big the waves are, Minny.

446
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:45,595
Let's go to the beach.
Run, get Mr. Walters!

447
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:47,479
He loves riding these waves!

448
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,935
You know we went to Biloxi
on our honeymoon?

449
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,566
Yes, ma'am.

450
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:55,400
Are we in Biloxi, Minny?

451
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:59,567
No, ma'am. We ain't.

452
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:06,915
Why don't you sit down here for a spell.

453
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:12,872
And then me and you will go on down
to the beach in a little while.

454
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:14,381
How about that?

455
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,265
Uh...

456
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:30,180
Miss Hilly?

457
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:31,940
Mm-hm?

458
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:35,773
Never mind.

459
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:38,815
You go on ahead and use
the inside bath, Minny, it's all right.

460
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,904
Oh, for crying out loud,
it's just a little rain.

461
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:45,617
She can go on up and get an umbrella
from William's study.

462
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:50,034
I believe she was working for me
before you dragged us both here.

463
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,793
Daddy ruined you.

464
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:01,128
I'm just gonna get your tea.

465
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:31,332
Minny?

466
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:34,374
Minny, are you in there?

467
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:37,756
Yes, ma'am.

468
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:40,835
And just what are you doing?

469
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,390
Get off my toilet!

470
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:58,193
You are fired, Minny Jackson!

471
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,740
Go on!

472
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,923
Eighteen people
died in Jackson that day.

473
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:27,180
Ten white and eight black.

474
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:35,639
God don't pay no mind to color once
He decide to set a tornado loose.

475
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:38,729
Aibee's here, honey.

476
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,439
Aibee's here.

477
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:05,423
Hurry, Aibileen! Mae Mobley
is up, and I'm off to the doctor!

478
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:14,561
That's Aibee's bathroom, Mama.
Hey, Aibee!

479
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,188
No, no, no, honey.
Promise me you won't go in there, OK?

480
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:18,644
Yes, ma'am.

481
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,684
I'm right here, Baby Girl.

482
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,105
Isn't it so nice
to have your own, Aibileen?

483
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:26,398
Yes, ma'am.

484
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:45,425
You're my real mama, Aibee.

485
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,286
- Is that Minny?
- Minny.

486
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,872
Hey, Aibileen!

487
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:17,574
Hey, Minny!

488
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,584
Mm-hmm.

489
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:20,915
Where you headed?

490
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:25,336
I got some business to tend to,
so y'all just mind your own.

491
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,967
All right, then. Well, bye!

492
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,924
Bye!

493
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:32,760
Now is she mad at me 'cause I got
that job at Miss Hilly's?

494
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:35,596
Don't worry about her.
She always mad about something.

495
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,058
Aibileen.

496
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,643
Yes, ma'am. Everything OK?

497
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,937
Yeah, I just wanted to talk to you.

498
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:50,149
You got some more
Miss Myrna questions for me?

499
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:51,988
Oh, no, I just wanted to talk about...

500
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:58,285
We never finished our conversation
at Elizabeth's.

501
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:00,667
About that book I want to write?

502
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:18,392
I'd really like
to interview you, Aibileen.

503
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:20,683
I know it's scary.

504
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,644
They set my cousin
Shinelle's car on fire,

505
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:29,859
just 'cause she went down
to the voting station.

506
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,274
A book like this has never
been written before.

507
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,113
'Cause there's a reason.

508
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:37,119
I do this with you, I might as well
burn my own house down.

509
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,575
I promise we'll be careful.

510
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,207
This already ain't careful,
Miss Skeeter!

511
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:49,173
You not knowing that is what's
scaring me the most.

512
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,426
Scare me more than Jim Crow.

513
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:55,467
All right.

514
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:57,883
Here's my phone number.

515
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:04,811
- My car's here. I could take you home.
- No, ma'am.

516
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:20,159
"No person shall
require any white female

517
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:24,747
to nurse in wards or rooms
in which Negro men are placed.

518
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:32,093
Books shall not be interchangeable
between the white and colored schools,

519
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:37,298
but shall continue to be used
by the race first using them.

520
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:44,934
No colored barber shall serve as
a barber to white women or girls.

521
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:49,234
Any person printing, publishing

522
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,235
or circulating written matter

523
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:56,651
urging for public acceptance or social
equality between whites and Negroes

524
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,944
is subject to imprisonment. "

525
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:01,200
Hello?

526
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:04,536
Aibileen, I done went and did it now.

527
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:07,623
I went to Miss Hilly's house
this afternoon.

528
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,288
Why Minny?

529
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:12,754
She done told every white woman
in town I'm a thief

530
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:15,385
Said I stole a candelabra.

531
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,172
But I got her back.

532
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:21,012
What you did?

533
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:23,685
I can't tell you.

534
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:27,055
I ain 't telling nobody.

535
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:35,280
I done something terrible awful
to that woman,

536
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:38,032
and now she know what I done.

537
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:39,488
Sorry.

538
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,781
Minny.

539
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:46,950
She got what she deserved, Aibileen.

540
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,912
But now I ain't gonna never get
no job again.

541
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:55,170
Oh, Lord, Leroy gonna kill me.

542
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:02,382
Leroy?

543
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,469
What you done did now, Minny?

544
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,398
- Get off that phone, woman!
- Leroy, please!

545
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:13,106
Minny? Minny!

546
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:15,487
Please! Please!

547
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:16,771
Come here!

548
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:28,996
Please open your Bibles to Exodus.

549
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:32,412
Chapter four, verse ten.

550
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:37,463
God, having asked Moses
to free the Israelites...

551
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:40,845
...Moses answered:

552
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:46,559
"Oh, my Lord. I am not eloquent.

553
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:51,682
I am slow of speech and slow of tongue."

554
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:58,605
See, courage isn't just
about being brave.

555
00:39:58,771 --> 00:39:59,818
Amen!

556
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:02,200
Courage is daring to do what is right

557
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:05,286
in spite of the weakness of our flesh.

558
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:07,823
And God tells us,

559
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:11,284
commands us, compels us,

560
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:13,704
-to love. Amen?
- Amen.

561
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,582
See, love,

562
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:21,379
as exemplified
by our Lord Jesus Christ,

563
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:25,390
is to be prepared to put yourself
in harm's way

564
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,516
- for your fellow man.

565
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,973
And by your fellow man,
I mean your brother,

566
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:34,976
your sister, your neighbor,
your friend and your enemy.

567
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:39,146
If you can love your enemy,
you already have the victory.

568
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:41,406
Let's stand. All right.

569
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,299
Quick. Come quick.

570
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:07,716
I parked way up on State Street and
caught a cab here, like you asked.

571
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,384
Got dropped two streets over?

572
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,018
Mm-hm.

573
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:28,453
I know now that it's against the law,
what we're doing.

574
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,792
I've never seen you
out of uniform before.

575
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:41,253
You look really nice.

576
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:43,592
Thank you.

577
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:04,738
I ain't never had no white person
in my house before.

578
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:08,360
Miss Skeeter...

579
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:15,788
...what if you don't like what I
got to say... about white people?

580
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,128
This isn't about me.

581
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,381
It doesn't matter how I feel.

582
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:33,931
You gonna have to change my name.
Mine, Miss Leefolt's. Everybody.

583
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:37,476
Do you have other maids
that are interested?

584
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,392
That gonna be hard.

585
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,232
What about Minny?

586
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,987
Minny got her some stories,
sure enough,

587
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:48,992
but she ain't real keen on talking
to white peoples right now.

588
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:54,747
What does it feel like
to raise a white child

589
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:57,785
when your own child's at home being
looked after by somebody else?

590
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,167
It feel...

591
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,767
Is that your son?

592
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:22,809
Yes, ma'am.

593
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:25,148
Can we move on to the next question?

594
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:28,190
You don't have to call me ma'am.

595
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:30,775
Not here.

596
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:37,786
Uh...

597
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:40,372
Do you want to talk about the bathroom?

598
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:44,172
Or anything about Miss Leefolt?

599
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:49,795
How she pays you, or has she ever
yelled at you in front of Mae Mobley?

600
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:57,560
I thought I might write my stories down
and read them to you.

601
00:43:58,261 --> 00:44:00,355
Ain't no different than writing down
my prayers.

602
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,730
OK.

603
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,317
Sure.

604
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:18,164
I don't say my prayers out loud.

605
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:21,496
I can get my point across
a lot better writing them down.

606
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:26,711
I write an hour,
sometimes two, every night.

607
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:31,549
And after my prayers last night,
I got some stories down, too.

608
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:36,136
Go ahead.

609
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:48,861
"My first white baby to ever look after

610
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:52,240
was named Alton Carrington Speers.

611
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:56,448
It was 1925, and I had just turned 14.

612
00:44:57,111 --> 00:45:00,160
I dropped out of school
to help Mama with the bills.

613
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:02,917
Alton's mama died of lung disease."

614
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:10,462
I loved that baby. And he loved me.

615
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:16,014
That's when I learned I could make
children feel proud of theyself.

616
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:22,186
Alton used to always be asking me
how come I was black.

617
00:45:22,345 --> 00:45:24,393
Just ate him up.

618
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:28,435
And one time, I told him it was because
I drank too much coffee.

619
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:35,316
You should have seen his face.

620
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:50,297
This was just so great.

621
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:55,591
I can't tell you how much I appreciate
your doing this with me.

622
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,555
What changed your mind?

623
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:01,384
God.

624
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:05,520
And Miss Hilly Holbrook.

625
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:23,410
Miss Hilly, I would like to ask you
and Mr. William something.

626
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:30,917
My twin boys graduated from high school,
both on the honor roll.

627
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:35,050
Me and my husband, we been saving
for years to send them to Tougaloo.

628
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:40,173
We're short about $75
on one of the tuitions.

629
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:47,188
Whoo! I am late. I gotta get going.

630
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:51,358
See you tonight, honey.

631
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:52,564
OK.

632
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:56,105
Go on.

633
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:02,487
Well, now we're...

634
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,372
...faced with having to choose

635
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:08,159
which son can go if we don't
come up with the money.

636
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:11,996
Would you consider giving us a loan?

637
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:17,969
I'd work every day for free
till it was paid off.

638
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:22,132
That's not working for free.
That's paying off a debt.

639
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:26,135
Yes, ma'am.

640
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:34,311
As a Christian, I'm doing you a favor.

641
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:40,283
See, God don't give charity to those
who are well and able.

642
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:45,242
You need to come up with this money
on your own. OK?

643
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:49,496
Yes, ma'am.

644
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:51,126
You'll thank me one day.

645
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:57,007
You cooking white food,
you taste it with a different spoon.

646
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,878
If they see you put the tasting spoon
back in the pot,

647
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:01,387
might as well throw it all out.

648
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,717
Spoon, too.

649
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,100
And you use the same cup, same fork,
same plate every day.

650
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:07,851
And you put it up in the cabinet.

651
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,729
You tell that white woman that's where
you're gonna keep it from now on out.

652
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,686
Don't do it and see what happens.

653
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,521
Morning, ladies.

654
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:16,356
When you're sewing white folks coffee,

655
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:17,816
set it down in front of them.

656
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:20,652
Don't hand it to them,
'cause your hands can't touch.

657
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,159
And don't hit on they children.

658
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,867
White folks like to do
they own spanking.

659
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:30,658
And last thing. Come here.

660
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:33,168
Look at me.

661
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:35,671
No Sass-mouthing.

662
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:40,168
No Sass-mouthing.

663
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,052
I mean it.

664
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:48,601
Give your mama a kiss.

665
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:55,768
Leroy had made Sugar quit
school to help him with the bills.

666
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:03,070
And every day Minny
went without a job,

667
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:05,985
might have been a day Leroy
took her from our world.

668
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:12,200
Good morning, everybody.

669
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:20,378
But I knew.

670
00:49:20,541 --> 00:49:24,842
I knew the only white lady Miss Hilly
hadn't gotten to with her lies.

671
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,938
Hey!

672
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:38,146
Come on!

673
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:42,780
No sass-mouthing, Minny Jackson.
No Sass-mouthing.

674
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,318
Aibileen said you'd be on time.

675
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:53,449
I'm Celia Rae Foote.

676
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:55,289
I'm Minny Jackson.

677
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:59,960
You, uh... cooking something?

678
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:04,590
One of those upside-down cakes
from a magazine.

679
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:08,507
It ain't working out too good.
Come on, let's get you a cold Coca-Cola.

680
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:12,218
Come on.

681
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:16,393
This here is the kitchen.

682
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,938
What in the hell?

683
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:25,735
I guess I got some learning to do.

684
00:50:26,482 --> 00:50:29,531
You sure do.

685
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:32,742
Johnny's grandmama left him this house
when she died.

686
00:50:32,905 --> 00:50:35,909
And then Johnny's mama
wouldn't let me change a thing.

687
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:38,077
But if I had it my way,

688
00:50:38,244 --> 00:50:43,125
this place would be wall-to-wall
white carpet with gold trim.

689
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,463
None of this old stuff.

690
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:47,924
The main house has
five beds and baths,

691
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:52,388
and then the pool house has
two more beds and baths.

692
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,723
When y'all gonna start
having some children,

693
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,979
filling up all these empty beds?

694
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:01,767
- I'm pregnant now.
- Oh.

695
00:51:01,934 --> 00:51:05,438
Gonna be eating for two.
That's double the cooking.

696
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,359
I know. It's an awful lotto do.

697
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:13,496
Five other maids have
already turned me down.

698
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:17,116
Let me at least get you some bus money.

699
00:51:17,283 --> 00:51:20,708
Now, uh... when did you hear me say
I don't want to clean this house?

700
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:25,208
Wait. So you'll do it?

701
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,473
Ooh. No hugging. No hugging.

702
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:38,979
I'm sorry. This is the first time
I've hired a maid.

703
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,435
Come on.

704
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:51,158
- You hungry?
- No, ma'am. Hold on a minute.

705
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:53,365
We gots to talk about
some things first.

706
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:57,406
Oh.

707
00:51:57,573 --> 00:51:59,200
I work Sunday through Friday.

708
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:02,370
No, you can't work at all
on the weekends.

709
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:05,915
OK. What time you want me here?

710
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:10,928
After 9:00, and you gotta leave
before 4:00.

711
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:13,259
OK.

712
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:15,140
Now...

713
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:16,892
What your husband say you can pay?

714
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,646
Johnny doesn't know
I'm bringing in help.

715
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,898
And what Mr. Johnny gonna do
when he come home

716
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:25,230
and find a colored woman in his house?

717
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:28,191
It's not like I'd be fibbing.

718
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:30,777
I just want him to think I can do this
on my own.

719
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:35,236
I really need a maid.

720
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:39,615
I'll be here tomorrow morning
about 9:15.

721
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:42,868
Great.

722
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,549
- Miss Celia?
- Hmm?

723
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:51,001
I think you done burned up your cake.

724
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:55,431
Doggone it!

725
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:03,848
- OK, let's see.
- What's first up on the agenda?

726
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:10,150
We are running behind on our coat drive.
Hurry up and clean out those closets.

727
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:15,364
But our Christmas benefit, however,
is right on schedule. Mary Beth?

728
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:21,290
Well, thanks to y'all, I can announce
that we already filled

729
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:24,497
every raffle slot for baked goods!

730
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:30,416
Think we can put a dent in
African children's hunger this year?

731
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,594
A big dent!

732
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,881
Now...

733
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,676
...I just found out
the surgeon general

734
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:44,222
has reviewed the Home Health
Sanitation Initiative that I drafted,

735
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:48,393
and he passed it along
to Governor Barnett!

736
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:52,568
Skeeter, when can we expect to see
the initiative in the newsletter?

737
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,403
I gave it to you a month ago.

738
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:56,488
I gave that to you myself.

739
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:59,620
Would you please stand, Skeeter?

740
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:06,414
I'll have it in there real soon.

741
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:10,665
Great.

742
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:21,384
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hey.

743
00:54:29,308 --> 00:54:30,309
Thanks.

744
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:38,575
Hilly, I really am sorry
about the newsletter.

745
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:41,032
It's just with Mama being sick and all.

746
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,706
Oh, it's fine.

747
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:49,419
I made you the egg and olive on rye,
Miss Skeeter.

748
00:54:49,578 --> 00:54:51,956
Oh, thank you, Henry.

749
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,624
You remembered.

750
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:55,134
You're welcome.

751
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:59,630
Oh, Hilly, tell her.
I can hardly stand it.

752
00:55:00,506 --> 00:55:03,100
He's coming.

753
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:06,683
Oh, Skeeter, Stuart's definitely
coming this time. Next Saturday week.

754
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:11,601
Well, he's canceled twice before.
Don't you think maybe that's a sign?

755
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:14,111
Don't you dare say that.

756
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:16,021
You know I'm not gonna be his type.

757
00:55:16,188 --> 00:55:18,407
Damn it, Skeeter, I'm not gonna
let you miss out on this

758
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:21,785
because your mother convinced you you're
not good enough for somebody like him.

759
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:27,666
Saturday night.

760
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:08,495
Good morning.

761
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:11,581
Good morning, Baby Girl.

762
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:14,041
Good morning.

763
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:28,806
I reckon I'm ready to talk about
Miss Leefolt now.

764
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:35,063
Baby Girl still gotta wear a diaper
when she sleep at night.

765
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,478
And it don't get changed till
I get there in the morning.

766
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:40,488
That about ten hours
she gotta sleep in her mess.

767
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:44,409
Now Miss Leefolt pregnant
with her second baby.

768
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:48,580
Lord... I pray this child
turn out good.

769
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:52,288
It's a lonely road if a mama
don't think their child is pretty.

770
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,088
That's very true.

771
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:02,927
Miss Leefolt should not
be having babies.

772
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:08,508
Write that down.

773
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:18,315
Treelore would like me doing this.

774
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:21,276
He always said we were gonna have
a writer in the family one day.

775
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,861
I always thought it was gonna be him.
Maybe it's gonna be me.

776
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:26,910
Aibileen, Aibileen.

777
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:29,868
They done set a bomb off
in Medgar Evers' carport.

778
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:42,172
Yule Mae told me what y'all was up to.
I didn't want to believe it.

779
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:48,011
And just what makes you think
colored people need your help?

780
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,725
- Why do you care?
- Minny.

781
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,682
Maybe you just want
to get Aibileen in trouble.

782
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:54,437
No.

783
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:56,974
I want to show her perspective.

784
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:00,815
So people might understand
what it's like from your side.

785
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:03,652
Well, it's a real Fourth of July picnic.

786
00:58:04,231 --> 00:58:07,485
It's what we dream of doing
all weekend long.

787
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:10,404
Get back into they house,
polish the silver.

788
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:15,167
And we just love not making minimum wage
or getting Social Security.

789
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:20,043
And how we love they children
when they little.

790
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:24,001
And then they turn out
just like they mamas.

791
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,214
I know.

792
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:28,756
Maybe things can change.

793
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:31,016
What law's gonna say you
gotta be nice to your maid?

794
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:32,721
You don't have to do this now, Minny.

795
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:34,511
You damn right I don't!

796
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,393
You two give me the heart palpitations.

797
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:42,985
And that's a good mood.

798
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:57,538
All right. I'm gonna do it.

799
00:58:57,701 --> 00:59:01,672
But I need to make sure she understands
this ain't no game we playing here.

800
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:06,335
Slide your chair out from under
that table. Face me.

801
00:59:09,129 --> 00:59:12,884
I need to see you square on
at all times.

802
00:59:22,601 --> 00:59:24,194
I gotta come up with
your questions, too?

803
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:25,444
Oh.

804
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:31,034
Uh, let's begin
with where you were born.

805
00:59:31,193 --> 00:59:34,948
Belzoni, Mississippi,
on my great-auntie's sofa.

806
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:36,239
Next.

807
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:38,750
- I put the green beans in first.
- OK.

808
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:42,038
Then I get on the pork chops so I can
get started on that cornbread.

809
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:45,708
Once Minny got to talking
about food, she liked to never stop.

810
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:51,180
And when she got to talking about
the white ladies, it took all night.

811
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:55,844
Then she say, "Oh, Minny,
I'm gonna give you a paid vacation."

812
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:58,558
I ain't never had no paid vacation
in my life.

813
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,314
A week later I come back,
and they done moved to Mobile.

814
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:05,902
Miss Lazy Fingers scared I'd find
a new job before she moved.

815
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:08,109
Ain't that right, Aibileen?

816
01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:15,446
We gots to get some more maids.

817
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:18,957
It hard. You go try and see.

818
01:00:21,243 --> 01:00:22,745
OK, I will.

819
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:30,586
We gone and done it now.

820
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:38,348
Skeeter! Get down here! Something just
arrived from New York for you.

821
01:00:53,942 --> 01:00:54,943
What is that?

822
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:58,785
The Shinalator.
All the way from New York City.

823
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:02,493
I'm a good mother.
Come on. Sit down.

824
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:09,299
The whole system cost 11 dollars.
Even smells expensive.

825
01:01:10,959 --> 01:01:14,384
You're gonna look beautiful
on your date tonight.

826
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:16,890
I can feel the hope in your fingers.

827
01:01:19,885 --> 01:01:21,887
Holy shit.

828
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:24,647
- You shrunk five inches.
- Oh, my God.

829
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:26,854
You'll be able to wear heels tonight.

830
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:31,029
You're not leaving the house in those
awful Mexican man shoes.

831
01:01:31,188 --> 01:01:32,280
Can I take the Cadillac?

832
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:34,862
We promised the Cadillac
to Carlton and Rebecca tonight,

833
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:38,154
so William's cousin will just
have to come pick you up himself.

834
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,914
- I'll take the truck.
- It's hooked up to the motor grader.

835
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:42,073
I'll drive slow.

836
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,993
Skeeter! Skeeter!

837
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:50,007
Now remember, no gentleman wants
to spend the evening with a sourpuss.

838
01:01:50,165 --> 01:01:53,419
Don't mope! Smile!

839
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:58,933
And for heaven's sakes, don't sit like
some squaw Indian! Cross your ankles!

840
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:01,601
I love you!

841
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:12,654
Stuart, she'll be here any minute.

842
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:15,486
Hey.-

843
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:19,160
Skeeter.

844
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:25,538
Boys, we'll be right back. Y'all talk
about quarterbacks or something.

845
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,498
Yule Mae, get Miss Skeeter a Coca-Cola.

846
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:28,833
Yes, ma'am.

847
01:02:43,051 --> 01:02:44,052
Want a drink?

848
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:46,017
Just water, please.

849
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:51,443
Double Old Kentucky, straight
with a water back. Make that two backs.

850
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:54,480
You sure you don't want to just make it
the whole bottle and a straw?

851
01:02:55,272 --> 01:02:57,946
Honey, there's the lieutenant governor.
Let's go say hi.

852
01:03:02,404 --> 01:03:04,907
Good to see you, sir.
You remember my wife?

853
01:03:05,073 --> 01:03:06,290
Hi, how are you? Good to see you.

854
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:14,671
So, what do you do with your time?

855
01:03:15,834 --> 01:03:16,881
You work?

856
01:03:17,669 --> 01:03:19,091
I write.

857
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:22,633
But right now I'm working on
a domestic maintenance column

858
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:23,891
for The Jackson Journal.

859
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:27,183
You mean housekeeping.

860
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:31,896
Jesus, I can't think of anything worse
than reading a cleaning column,

861
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:33,901
except for maybe writing one.

862
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,607
Well, I can.

863
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:39,866
Working with a bunch of greasy,
stinky men in the middle of the ocean.

864
01:03:40,025 --> 01:03:43,529
It sounds like a ploy to find a husband,
becoming an expert in keeping house.

865
01:03:43,695 --> 01:03:47,325
Well, aren't you a genius?
You figured out my whole scheme.

866
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:50,710
Isn't that what all you girls
from Ole Miss major in...

867
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:52,587
...professional husband hunting?

868
01:03:52,746 --> 01:03:55,670
Who is hungry?

869
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:59,427
I'm sorry, but were you dropped
on your head as an infant?

870
01:03:59,586 --> 01:04:01,179
Or were you just born stupid?

871
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:25,074
So, what can you cook?

872
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:29,663
Oh, um, I can cook cornpone.

873
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:32,327
Boil potatoes.

874
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:34,462
I can do grits.

875
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:39,046
Well...

876
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:43,884
...I reckon if there's anything you
ought to know about cooking, it's this.

877
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:47,142
The most important invention since
they put mayonnaise in a jar.

878
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:51,270
You got gum in your hair,

879
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:53,648
you got a squeaky door hinge...

880
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:54,808
Crisco.

881
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,186
How pretty.

882
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:02,028
Looks like frosting.

883
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:05,069
You got bags under your eyes.

884
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:07,203
Want to soften your husband's
scaly feet.

885
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:09,948
Mm-hm. Crisco.

886
01:05:11,366 --> 01:05:14,415
But it's best for frying chicken.

887
01:05:15,662 --> 01:05:17,335
Frying chicken just...

888
01:05:18,498 --> 01:05:20,592
...tend to make you
feel better about life.

889
01:05:24,129 --> 01:05:25,551
At least me, anyway.

890
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:29,597
Mm, I love me some fried chicken.

891
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:32,269
Now...

892
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:35,306
...shake that.

893
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:36,975
Oh.

894
01:05:41,813 --> 01:05:44,657
This is so much fun!

895
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:49,537
All right, all right.
The chicken already dead, Miss Celia.

896
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:54,660
Yep. He dead.

897
01:06:05,837 --> 01:06:07,180
There you are.

898
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:13,387
I'm starved. Looks so good.

899
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:15,646
We done been over this, Miss Celia.

900
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:19,685
You supposed to eat in the dining room.
That's how it works.

901
01:06:19,851 --> 01:06:21,023
Let me take your plate back.

902
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:23,780
I'm fine right here, Minny.

903
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:44,292
What?

904
01:06:45,752 --> 01:06:47,971
I just want you to know
I'm real grateful you're here.

905
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:50,882
You gots plenty more
to be grateful for than me.

906
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:55,645
And look, now I ain't
messing around no more.

907
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:57,100
Now Mr. Johnny gonna catch me here,

908
01:06:57,263 --> 01:07:00,107
and shoot me dead right here
on this no-wax floor.

909
01:07:01,184 --> 01:07:02,231
You gots to tell him.

910
01:07:02,393 --> 01:07:05,237
Ain't he wondering how
the cooking's so good?

911
01:07:05,396 --> 01:07:07,023
You're right.

912
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:10,860
Maybe we ought to
burn the chicken a little.

913
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:14,619
Minny don't burn chicken.

914
01:07:17,325 --> 01:07:20,955
I like this Sarah Ross. She testifies
without complaining too much.

915
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:24,750
And that Bertha,
she's got chutzpah, I'll give her that.

916
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:26,259
So you liked it?

917
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:29,045
Eugenia, Martin Luther King
just invited

918
01:07:29,212 --> 01:07:32,182
the entire country to march with him
in D.C. in August.

919
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:33,683
This many Negroes and whites

920
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:36,219
have not worked together since
Gone with the Wind.

921
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:39,139
How many stories have you
recorded thus far?

922
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:41,307
The ones you've read.

923
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:43,317
Two domestics, that's all?

924
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:47,485
I'm real close to
getting more interviews.

925
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:51,652
Don't send me anything else
until you do have more maids.

926
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:54,662
Yes, ma'am. How... how many more?

927
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:57,700
I don't know. At least a dozen.

928
01:07:57,865 --> 01:08:01,210
My advice to you is to write it
and write it fast

929
01:08:01,369 --> 01:08:03,713
before this whole civil rights thing
blows over.

930
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:05,544
Now good night to you, Miss Phelan.

931
01:08:18,011 --> 01:08:20,059
We need a dozen more.

932
01:08:20,888 --> 01:08:25,143
Me and Aibileen done asked everybody
we know. Thirty-one maids.

933
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:28,108
They all too scared. Think we crazy.

934
01:08:29,981 --> 01:08:32,109
If we don't get more,
we're not getting published.

935
01:08:32,275 --> 01:08:35,245
I gots plenty stories,
Miss Skeeter.

936
01:08:35,403 --> 01:08:38,998
Just write them down
and invent the maid that said it.

937
01:08:39,157 --> 01:08:41,706
You're already making up names.
Just make up the maids, too.

938
01:08:41,868 --> 01:08:45,793
We're not gonna do that.
That would be wrong.

939
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:47,298
Don't give up on this, Miss Skeeter.

940
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:49,084
It wouldn't be real.

941
01:08:50,627 --> 01:08:52,174
They Killed my son.

942
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:02,222
He fell carrying two-by-fours
at the mill.

943
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,979
Truck run over him, crushed his lung.

944
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:07,735
Aibileen.

945
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:13,817
That white foreman threw his body
on back of a truck.

946
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:17,488
Drove to the colored hospital...

947
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:19,622
...dumped him there and honked the horn.

948
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:34,304
There was nothing they could do,
so I brought my baby home.

949
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:41,303
Laid him down on that sofa right there.

950
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:46,933
He died right in front of me.

951
01:09:49,519 --> 01:09:53,149
He was just 24 years old, Miss Skeeter.
Best part of a person's life.

952
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:58,369
Anniversary of his death comes...

953
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:00,906
...every year, and I can't breathe.

954
01:10:01,072 --> 01:10:03,291
But to y'all, it's just
another day of bridge.

955
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:09,213
You stop this...

956
01:10:10,498 --> 01:10:14,298
...everything I wrote, he wrote,
everything he was is gonna die with him.

957
01:10:24,512 --> 01:10:27,732
I am just honored
to be hosting Elizabeth's shower.

958
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:30,109
Doesn't she look glowing, everybody?

959
01:10:30,268 --> 01:10:32,737
Yes, she does!

960
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:35,318
Honey, you hold on to it,
to the bitter end.

961
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:39,031
- I'll try.
- Well, congratulations.

962
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:43,164
I'm hungry, Mommy.

963
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:44,494
She's always hungry.

964
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:49,086
You know she can hear you, Elizabeth.

965
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:53,500
I'll cut you
a piece of cake, baby. Go on, now.

966
01:10:57,545 --> 01:11:02,392
Aibileen, are you enjoying your new
bathroom over at Elizabeth's'?

967
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:06,305
Nice to have your own.
Isn't it, Aibileen?

968
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:14,150
Yes, ma'am. And I thank you.

969
01:11:14,312 --> 01:11:16,986
Separate, but equal.

970
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:20,113
That's what Ross Barnett says,
and you can't argue with the governor.

971
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:24,497
Well, certainly not in Mississippi,
the birthplace of modern-day government.

972
01:11:40,838 --> 01:11:44,263
Hey, Miss Skeeter.
Can I get you something?

973
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:45,426
No, thanks.

974
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:49,097
Yule Mae, I wanted to talk to you
about something.

975
01:11:51,682 --> 01:11:53,855
I already know what you're gonna ask,
Miss Skeeter.

976
01:11:56,479 --> 01:11:58,231
Minny and Aibileen already did.

977
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:05,996
I'm trying to get my boys
off to college.

978
01:12:07,865 --> 01:12:10,869
It's worthwhile what
y'all are doing, but...

979
01:12:11,035 --> 01:12:13,629
...but my boys are worth more.

980
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:15,460
I understand.

981
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:22,805
What do you understand, Skeeter?

982
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:29,555
Yule Mae was just saying how excited she
is that her boys are going to college.

983
01:12:30,388 --> 01:12:33,062
Did you also ask Miss Skeeter
if you could borrow money?

984
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:35,234
Of course not.

985
01:12:37,395 --> 01:12:39,397
I'm gonna put Billy down for his nap.

986
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:42,779
Excuse me.

987
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:47,163
Come on, baby.

988
01:12:54,829 --> 01:12:59,585
Skeeter, are you intentionally not
putting my initiative in the newsletter?

989
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:03,550
No, not at all. I just have been
really busy with Mama.

990
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:05,556
I know.

991
01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:09,345
I know, you must be so worried
about your mother, but...

992
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,267
I'm worried about you.

993
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:14,899
Reading this stuff?

994
01:13:15,766 --> 01:13:19,691
Believe it or not, there are real
racists in this town.

995
01:13:20,438 --> 01:13:22,611
If the wrong person caught you
with anything like that,

996
01:13:22,773 --> 01:13:24,775
you'd be in serious trouble.

997
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:28,325
I'll be on the lookout.

998
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:34,535
Put my initiative in the newsletter.

999
01:13:38,205 --> 01:13:39,422
OK?

1000
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:31,142
Skeeter, get up!

1001
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,644
- No! What?
- We've got to get dressed.

1002
01:14:35,388 --> 01:14:36,514
What's wrong?

1003
01:14:36,681 --> 01:14:39,025
Don't panic. Don't panic.

1004
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:44,064
There's a particularly tall and very
handsome man named Stuart here for you.

1005
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:46,990
Oh, God.

1006
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:49,151
Oh, mother.

1007
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:51,867
You would not like him. Trust me.

1008
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:53,281
He's a drunken asshole.

1009
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:57,668
Love and hate are two horns on the same
goat, Eugenia, and you need a goat.

1010
01:14:57,827 --> 01:14:59,955
Put that on. Hurry!

1011
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:08,129
Look, I know it was a few weeks back,

1012
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:12,220
but I came to say I'm sorry
for the way I acted.

1013
01:15:12,383 --> 01:15:14,351
Who sent you, William or Hilly?

1014
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:15,636
Neither.

1015
01:15:15,803 --> 01:15:18,181
Hilly. But I wanted to come, OK.

1016
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:20,441
I was rude, and I've been
thinking about it a lot.

1017
01:15:21,017 --> 01:15:24,021
- Well, I haven't. So you can just go.
- Goddamn it!

1018
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:29,776
I told Hilly I wasn't ready to go out on
any date. Wasn't even close to ready.

1019
01:15:34,321 --> 01:15:36,790
I was engaged last year. She ended it.

1020
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:38,292
I'm sure she did.

1021
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:40,874
It's not like that.
I'm not always a jerk.

1022
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:46,717
We had been dating since we were 15,
and you know how it is.

1023
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:49,880
Actually, I don't. I've never really
dated anyone before.

1024
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:51,505
Ever?

1025
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:53,591
Ever.

1026
01:15:55,593 --> 01:15:57,971
All right, I, uh...

1027
01:15:59,889 --> 01:16:01,357
Well, that must be it, then.

1028
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:02,858
- What?
- You, Skeeter.

1029
01:16:03,017 --> 01:16:05,440
I've never met a woman that says
exactly what she's thinking.

1030
01:16:05,603 --> 01:16:08,402
- Well, I got plenty to say.
- Yeah, I'll bet you do.

1031
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:12,402
You make me laugh, smile.

1032
01:16:16,197 --> 01:16:17,915
Would you like to come
have dinner with me?

1033
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:22,837
We could talk. I could actually
listen to you this time.

1034
01:16:23,788 --> 01:16:25,711
I can't think of anything worse.

1035
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,298
I understand, and I'm sorry.

1036
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:32,009
That's what
I came here to say, and I said it.

1037
01:16:39,345 --> 01:16:40,437
Just give me a minute.

1038
01:16:41,388 --> 01:16:42,640
Let me get my sweater.

1039
01:16:48,813 --> 01:16:50,486
Not a big fan of oysters, huh?

1040
01:16:50,648 --> 01:16:53,367
Oysters are a vehicle
for crackers and ketchup.

1041
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:57,447
Well, here's to new beginnings.

1042
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,628
Mm.

1043
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:07,839
You're disgusting.

1044
01:17:07,998 --> 01:17:09,591
You've already made that pretty clear.

1045
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:13,300
And just so you know,
the boys caught me reading

1046
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:15,430
your Miss Myrna column
on the rig the other day.

1047
01:17:15,589 --> 01:17:18,092
Really? You read them?

1048
01:17:18,259 --> 01:17:19,260
All of them.

1049
01:17:20,219 --> 01:17:21,596
Very informative, too.

1050
01:17:21,762 --> 01:17:24,561
I had no idea that ground egg shells
got grease out of clothes.

1051
01:17:24,723 --> 01:17:26,145
Well, I do my homework.

1052
01:17:32,231 --> 01:17:33,904
You're a good writer, Skeeter.

1053
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:36,402
Thank you.

1054
01:17:39,113 --> 01:17:40,740
I want to be a journalist.

1055
01:17:41,824 --> 01:17:44,953
Or maybe a novelist. Or maybe both.

1056
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:47,083
I like that.

1057
01:17:49,415 --> 01:17:51,759
You're really smart. And pretty.

1058
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:01,977
Skeeter.

1059
01:18:03,304 --> 01:18:05,147
I hope you get to write something
really good.

1060
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:07,691
Something you believe in.

1061
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:21,113
Hello?

1062
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:26,460
What? I'm coming!

1063
01:18:26,619 --> 01:18:29,998
Aibileen! Come on. We have to go
help Hilly. Right now!

1064
01:18:34,627 --> 01:18:38,131
Oh! You're trespassing!

1065
01:18:38,297 --> 01:18:40,220
It's Skeeter!

1066
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:41,725
She put it in the newsletter.

1067
01:18:41,884 --> 01:18:43,101
Oh, my God.

1068
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:47,891
I specifically said,
"Drop old coats at my house."

1069
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:50,105
Not commodes!

1070
01:18:50,267 --> 01:18:52,110
Why would she do this to me?

1071
01:18:52,269 --> 01:18:54,112
I don't know. I don't Know, Hilly.

1072
01:18:54,271 --> 01:18:56,945
It's so embarrassing.

1073
01:19:04,990 --> 01:19:06,708
Oh, Lord.

1074
01:19:06,867 --> 01:19:08,244
I go potty, Mommy.

1075
01:19:09,245 --> 01:19:11,293
No! Mae Mobley!

1076
01:19:11,455 --> 01:19:13,503
You get off of that toilet!

1077
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:17,465
- You will catch diseases, you hear me?
- Mommy!

1078
01:19:17,628 --> 01:19:19,630
You will catch diseases
on those toilets.

1079
01:19:33,394 --> 01:19:37,490
You is kind, you is smart,

1080
01:19:37,648 --> 01:19:39,867
you is important.

1081
01:19:50,327 --> 01:19:53,297
Don't shop for anything
on Capitol Street.

1082
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:58,336
Let's let the merchants down on
Capitol Street feel the economic pinch.

1083
01:19:58,502 --> 01:20:00,425
Let me say this to you.

1084
01:20:00,587 --> 01:20:03,306
I had one merchant to call me,
and he said,

1085
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:08,096
"I want you to know that I've
talked to my national office today,

1086
01:20:08,262 --> 01:20:11,562
and they want me to tell you that we
don't need nigger business."

1087
01:20:12,975 --> 01:20:16,730
These are stores that help to support
the White Citizens' Council,

1088
01:20:16,895 --> 01:20:21,116
the council that is dedicated to keeping
you and I second-class citizens.

1089
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:23,118
Mama!

1090
01:20:25,946 --> 01:20:27,493
Don't encourage them like that.

1091
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:30,034
- That is national news.
- I won't have it!

1092
01:20:32,953 --> 01:20:34,250
You understand?

1093
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:46,016
How you doing, Miss Clark?

1094
01:20:47,634 --> 01:20:50,228
All right, Henry.

1095
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:52,264
Thank you. How you doing?

1096
01:20:53,599 --> 01:20:57,354
If God is willing, Miss Clark.
If God is willing.

1097
01:20:57,519 --> 01:20:58,941
That's good.

1098
01:20:59,104 --> 01:21:00,697
- Yeah.
- That's good.

1099
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:10,783
What's going on out there, mister?

1100
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:12,917
Colored people off.

1101
01:21:13,077 --> 01:21:14,670
The rest of you,
let me know where you're going.

1102
01:21:14,828 --> 01:21:15,954
I'll get you close as I can.

1103
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:17,714
What happened?

1104
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:19,671
I don't know. Some nigger got shot.

1105
01:21:20,667 --> 01:21:22,635
- Where you headed?
- Woodrow Wilson.

1106
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:24,763
Woodrow Wilson. All right.

1107
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:37,689
- You gonna be all right, Miss Clark?
- I'll be all right. You go on now.

1108
01:21:37,851 --> 01:21:40,104
- You want me to walk you?
- No, thank you. I'll be all right.

1109
01:21:41,438 --> 01:21:42,781
You have a good night.

1110
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,158
Which way you going?

1111
01:21:53,158 --> 01:21:56,128
We View this as a cold,

1112
01:21:56,286 --> 01:21:58,254
brutal, deliberate...

1113
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:03,670
...killing in a savage,
uncivilized state.

1114
01:22:03,836 --> 01:22:09,013
There is no state with a record that
approaches that of Mississippi

1115
01:22:09,174 --> 01:22:13,350
in inhumanity murder, brutality

1116
01:22:13,512 --> 01:22:15,560
and racial hatred.

1117
01:22:15,722 --> 01:22:19,397
It is absolutely at the bottom
of the list.

1118
01:22:20,894 --> 01:22:22,020
Fifteen minutes past midnight,

1119
01:22:22,187 --> 01:22:25,942
Evers got out of his car beside his home
in a Negro residential area.

1120
01:22:26,108 --> 01:22:28,031
In a vacant lot about 40 yards away

1121
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:31,618
a sniper fired a single shot from a
high-powered rifle at Evers' silhouette.

1122
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:34,124
I'm all right. Sit down. You all right?

1123
01:22:34,283 --> 01:22:35,876
- I'm OK.
- The bullet hit him in the back,

1124
01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:38,913
crashed through his body
through a window, into the house.

1125
01:22:39,079 --> 01:22:41,548
He died within an hour
at a Jackson hospital.

1126
01:22:41,707 --> 01:22:44,051
City detectives believe the fatal shot
was fired from...

1127
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:48,214
KKK shot him. An hour ago.

1128
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:51,933
Right in front of his children,
Aibileen.

1129
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:56,559
We're gonna pray for the Evers.
We're gonna pray for Myrlie.

1130
01:22:56,722 --> 01:23:00,067
We living in hell. Trapped.

1131
01:23:01,018 --> 01:23:02,440
Our kids, trapped.

1132
01:23:05,898 --> 01:23:08,401
Sugar, take your brothers and sisters
and y'all go on to bed.

1133
01:23:13,864 --> 01:23:15,707
Good night.

1134
01:23:15,866 --> 01:23:18,210
Good night. Good night.

1135
01:23:20,579 --> 01:23:22,752
Oh. Good night, baby.

1136
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:36,471
What they gonna do if they catch us
with Miss Skeeter?

1137
01:23:37,471 --> 01:23:38,848
We're gonna be careful.

1138
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:44,862
Hitch us to a pickup? Drag us behind?
Shoot me in front of my children?

1139
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:47,523
We ain't doing civil rights.

1140
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:50,613
We're just telling stories
like they really happened.

1141
01:23:52,486 --> 01:23:54,830
You're a fool, old woman.

1142
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:57,453
A fool.

1143
01:24:28,021 --> 01:24:32,993
Miss Phelan, the presses are heating up.
We needed Miss Myrna 30 minutes ago.

1144
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:34,611
Yes, Sir.

1145
01:24:34,778 --> 01:24:36,325
Chop-chop.

1146
01:24:37,614 --> 01:24:38,991
Good Lord.

1147
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:56,675
Miss Celia?

1148
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:15,490
Miss Celia?

1149
01:25:15,652 --> 01:25:17,654
- Go home.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

1150
01:25:17,821 --> 01:25:20,074
You mess up your hair coloring again?

1151
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:23,710
I helped you ix it last time.
We got it back to butter batch.

1152
01:25:23,869 --> 01:25:25,462
Was real pretty, remember?

1153
01:25:29,499 --> 01:25:30,842
Miss Celia.

1154
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:33,803
I told you, go home!

1155
01:25:49,770 --> 01:25:51,317
I said get out!

1156
01:26:07,204 --> 01:26:09,753
Why is there so much blood?

1157
01:26:15,337 --> 01:26:19,262
Next one's gonna catch, Miss Celia.
You just wait and see.

1158
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:24,267
We got married 'cause I was pregnant.

1159
01:26:26,682 --> 01:26:29,026
Then I lost it a month later.

1160
01:26:31,561 --> 01:26:33,529
Johnny wants kids now.

1161
01:26:37,067 --> 01:26:38,819
What's he gonna do with me?

1162
01:26:41,863 --> 01:26:43,115
Well...

1163
01:26:44,533 --> 01:26:46,535
Mr. Johnny just gonna have
to get over it.

1164
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:51,127
He doesn't know about the baby.

1165
01:26:55,335 --> 01:26:57,212
Or the two before.

1166
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:53,443
Yule Mae Davis?

1167
01:27:56,354 --> 01:27:58,652
- What do you want me to do?
- You're under arrest.

1168
01:27:59,858 --> 01:28:03,203
Just call my husband.
Just call my husband.

1169
01:28:06,907 --> 01:28:10,207
- Wait a minute. I want my purse.
- No, you're under arrest.

1170
01:28:10,368 --> 01:28:14,168
I want to get my purse.
I want to get my purse! Aibee!

1171
01:28:14,956 --> 01:28:17,129
- Don't fight, Yule Mae!
- Aibee!

1172
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:21,388
Aibee, I want my purse! I want my purse!

1173
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:27,223
Just let me go!

1174
01:28:28,011 --> 01:28:30,264
Yule Mae, don't fight.

1175
01:28:38,814 --> 01:28:41,943
I knew she was a thief
the day she started.

1176
01:28:42,776 --> 01:28:46,952
A nigra walks into a pawn shop
with a ring of such size and color.

1177
01:28:48,281 --> 01:28:51,376
It took them all of ten minutes
to find out where she worked.

1178
01:28:53,411 --> 01:28:55,709
I am desperate for
a grilled cheese sandwich.

1179
01:28:55,872 --> 01:28:58,295
Are you? Are you?
Do you want a grilled cheese sandwich?

1180
01:28:58,458 --> 01:29:00,131
Oh, yes.

1181
01:29:00,293 --> 01:29:02,045
Just go sit down over there.

1182
01:29:08,718 --> 01:29:13,098
Miss Skeeter, you best head on over
to Miss Aibileen's house.

1183
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:14,891
Now.

1184
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:47,553
I'm gonna help with your stories.

1185
01:29:48,925 --> 01:29:51,269
I'm gonna help, too. Mm-hm.

1186
01:29:53,138 --> 01:29:54,310
We all are.

1187
01:29:54,472 --> 01:29:57,442
- That's right.
- I'll help you.

1188
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:01,279
I used to take
a shortcut every day

1189
01:30:01,438 --> 01:30:04,157
when I went to work
at Dr. Dixon's house.

1190
01:30:04,816 --> 01:30:07,865
Cut through that farmer's lower 40
to get there.

1191
01:30:08,028 --> 01:30:11,874
One day this farmer
was waiting for me with a gun.

1192
01:30:12,032 --> 01:30:15,627
Said he'd shoot me dead
if I walked on his land again.

1193
01:30:16,328 --> 01:30:22,051
Dr. Dixon went and paid that farmer
double for two of those acres.

1194
01:30:22,584 --> 01:30:25,428
Told him he was gonna
start farming, too.

1195
01:30:26,379 --> 01:30:31,055
But he bought that just for me,
so I could get to work easy.

1196
01:30:32,344 --> 01:30:33,561
He did.

1197
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:36,769
I worked for Miss Jolene's mother
till the day she died.

1198
01:30:37,641 --> 01:30:41,145
Then her daughter, Miss Nancy,
asked me to come and work for her.

1199
01:30:42,228 --> 01:30:44,526
Miss Nancy is a real sweet lady.

1200
01:30:45,523 --> 01:30:49,903
But Miss Jolene's ma done put it in her
will I got to work for Miss Jolene.

1201
01:30:50,946 --> 01:30:53,790
Miss Jolene's a mean woman.

1202
01:30:53,949 --> 01:30:55,496
Mean for sport.

1203
01:30:57,827 --> 01:31:00,501
Lord, I tried to find another job.

1204
01:31:01,581 --> 01:31:03,709
But in everybody's mind

1205
01:31:03,875 --> 01:31:07,254
the French family
and Miss Jolene owned me.

1206
01:31:09,422 --> 01:31:10,765
Owned me.

1207
01:31:16,513 --> 01:31:18,311
I leave early
this week for Thanksgiving.

1208
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:21,272
Our last editors' meeting
is December 17th,

1209
01:31:21,434 --> 01:31:23,186
so if you want a prayer
of this getting read,

1210
01:31:23,353 --> 01:31:26,357
- I'd better have it by then.
- That's in three weeks, Miss Stein.

1211
01:31:26,523 --> 01:31:29,026
Well, otherwise it goes in the pile.

1212
01:31:29,192 --> 01:31:31,991
You do not want it in the pile.

1213
01:31:32,153 --> 01:31:33,245
Yes, ma'am.

1214
01:31:33,405 --> 01:31:36,750
And put something personal in there.
Write about the maid who raised you.

1215
01:31:38,118 --> 01:31:39,461
I understand.

1216
01:31:47,127 --> 01:31:49,926
Well, we have a lot of work to do
before the benefit, don't we?

1217
01:31:50,088 --> 01:31:53,092
I know, but I think We're on track.
We're doing quite well.

1218
01:32:01,433 --> 01:32:02,935
- it's so good.
- Mm-hm.

1219
01:32:03,101 --> 01:32:04,944
- Who's there?
- I don't know.

1220
01:32:05,729 --> 01:32:06,730
Aibileen?

1221
01:32:09,232 --> 01:32:10,825
Hey, Elizabeth!

1222
01:32:10,984 --> 01:32:13,328
It's me, Celia Foote.

1223
01:32:15,447 --> 01:32:18,917
I was in the neighborhood.
Thought I'd drop by.

1224
01:32:20,577 --> 01:32:23,296
Everybody hide.
Everybody get down, get down.

1225
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:26,458
Get down! Get down! Get down!

1226
01:32:29,669 --> 01:32:31,592
- Turn off the music.
- Who are we hiding from?

1227
01:32:31,755 --> 01:32:33,598
Shh!

1228
01:32:36,926 --> 01:32:39,679
Hey!

1229
01:32:39,846 --> 01:32:40,893
Shh!

1230
01:32:44,809 --> 01:32:46,152
I brought a chocolate pie!

1231
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,733
My maid, Minny, made it.

1232
01:32:58,073 --> 01:33:00,326
She's in the bushes.

1233
01:33:22,138 --> 01:33:26,894
Don't be taking those women
any more pies, you understand?

1234
01:33:35,193 --> 01:33:38,618
They made me stand there like I was
the vacuum salesman.

1235
01:33:40,698 --> 01:33:41,870
Why, Minny?

1236
01:33:43,993 --> 01:33:47,873
Because they know about you getting
knocked up by Mr. Johnny.

1237
01:33:48,039 --> 01:33:49,962
Mad you married one of their mens.

1238
01:33:50,792 --> 01:33:54,717
And especially since Miss Hilly and
Mr. Johnny had just broke up, too.

1239
01:33:54,879 --> 01:33:57,428
Hilly probably thinks that I was
fooling around with Johnny

1240
01:33:57,590 --> 01:33:59,263
when they were still going steady.

1241
01:33:59,425 --> 01:34:01,519
Mm-hm.

1242
01:34:01,678 --> 01:34:05,933
And Missus Walters always said Miss
Hilly still sweet on Mr. Johnny, too.

1243
01:34:07,809 --> 01:34:09,311
No wonder!

1244
01:34:12,313 --> 01:34:16,489
They don't hate me.
They hate what they think I did.

1245
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:20,034
They hate you 'cause they think
you white trash.

1246
01:34:20,196 --> 01:34:23,120
I'm just going to have to tell Hilly
I ain't no boyfriend stealer.

1247
01:34:24,742 --> 01:34:27,541
In fact, I'll tell her Friday night
at the benefit.

1248
01:34:28,663 --> 01:34:30,961
You don't need to be going
to that benefit, Miss Celia.

1249
01:34:33,126 --> 01:34:35,720
Did you hear me? You just stay home.

1250
01:34:39,841 --> 01:34:41,013
That looks bad.

1251
01:34:43,386 --> 01:34:44,729
Let me take a look.

1252
01:34:45,597 --> 01:34:47,270
I got to get these peas on.

1253
01:34:47,432 --> 01:34:50,185
I know you didn't fall
in no tub, Minny.

1254
01:35:11,456 --> 01:35:14,005
You know what I'd do if I were you?

1255
01:35:15,752 --> 01:35:17,846
I'd give it right back to him.

1256
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:22,259
I'd hit him over the head
with a skillet,

1257
01:35:22,425 --> 01:35:25,178
and I'd tell him, "Go straight to hell."

1258
01:35:35,605 --> 01:35:37,949
From here, the members of the family...

1259
01:35:41,319 --> 01:35:44,664
...visitors from foreign countries
and others

1260
01:35:44,822 --> 01:35:47,826
will walk to St. Matthew's Cathedral.

1261
01:35:54,374 --> 01:35:57,173
Senator Edward Kennedy
getting out of the car.

1262
01:35:59,212 --> 01:36:00,555
Mrs. Kennedy.

1263
01:36:01,965 --> 01:36:03,967
Robert Kennedy, Attorney General.

1264
01:36:04,133 --> 01:36:06,227
Sweetheart, I gotta
get down to the coast.

1265
01:36:07,512 --> 01:36:09,139
I'll be back in time for the benefit.

1266
01:36:21,442 --> 01:36:23,865
The world done gone crazy,
Miss Skeeter, and I'm scared.

1267
01:36:24,612 --> 01:36:27,866
What if people ind out what we writing,
figure out Niceville really Jackson,

1268
01:36:28,032 --> 01:36:29,375
figure out who who?

1269
01:36:32,578 --> 01:36:34,501
Maybe we need us some insurance.

1270
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:40,470
I told God I'd never speak of it again.

1271
01:36:41,671 --> 01:36:43,469
But we ain't got no choice.

1272
01:36:44,966 --> 01:36:45,967
Sorry.

1273
01:36:47,093 --> 01:36:50,973
I need to tell y'all about the terrible
awful I done to Miss Hilly.

1274
01:36:52,473 --> 01:36:54,601
It might be the only thing
that keep us safe.

1275
01:36:59,522 --> 01:37:01,069
Mmm.

1276
01:37:01,232 --> 01:37:03,200
Mm-mm-mm.

1277
01:37:06,571 --> 01:37:07,823
So...

1278
01:37:09,657 --> 01:37:12,501
Nobody wanted to hire a sass-mouthing,
thieving nigra.

1279
01:37:15,371 --> 01:37:16,543
Did they?

1280
01:37:23,921 --> 01:37:26,515
Oh. Pie's as good as always, Minny.

1281
01:37:26,674 --> 01:37:27,926
I'm glad you like it.

1282
01:37:28,092 --> 01:37:29,469
Mmm.

1283
01:37:31,095 --> 01:37:33,143
Oh.

1284
01:37:33,306 --> 01:37:38,233
If I take you back, I'll have to cut
your pay five dollars a week.

1285
01:37:38,394 --> 01:37:39,862
Take me back?

1286
01:37:42,357 --> 01:37:46,112
What do you put in here
that makes it taste so good?

1287
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:49,030
That good vanilla from Mexico...

1288
01:37:49,197 --> 01:37:51,825
...and something else real special.

1289
01:37:53,368 --> 01:37:54,620
Mmm.

1290
01:37:54,786 --> 01:37:58,962
No, no, no, Missus Walters.
That's Miss Hilly's special pie.

1291
01:38:01,959 --> 01:38:03,381
Mama can have a piece.

1292
01:38:05,380 --> 01:38:07,428
Cut her one.

1293
01:38:09,217 --> 01:38:10,560
Go get a plate.

1294
01:38:15,515 --> 01:38:16,732
Eat my shit.

1295
01:38:20,978 --> 01:38:22,355
What'd you say?

1296
01:38:22,939 --> 01:38:26,569
I said, "Eat... my... shit."

1297
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:37,503
Have you lost your mind?

1298
01:38:39,163 --> 01:38:44,465
No, ma'am, but you about to,
'cause you just did.

1299
01:38:45,169 --> 01:38:47,797
Did what?

1300
01:39:08,860 --> 01:39:10,908
And you didn't eat just one.

1301
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:13,243
You had two slices!

1302
01:39:23,332 --> 01:39:26,085
Run, Minny, run!

1303
01:39:30,673 --> 01:39:32,266
You trying to get yourself killed?

1304
01:39:32,425 --> 01:39:35,349
No! I wasn't planning on telling.

1305
01:39:37,305 --> 01:39:39,148
I just wanted to see her take a bite.

1306
01:39:40,433 --> 01:39:44,313
Then I was gonna leave.
Be done with her forever.

1307
01:39:45,521 --> 01:39:48,240
Before I knew it, I had done
told that woman what was in that pie!

1308
01:39:51,235 --> 01:39:53,112
I done ask God to forgive me.

1309
01:39:55,114 --> 01:39:57,993
But more for what happened
to poor Miss Walters.

1310
01:40:00,036 --> 01:40:04,792
Miss Hilly threw her in that
nursing home... just for laughing.

1311
01:40:06,375 --> 01:40:08,093
We can't put that story in the book.

1312
01:40:08,961 --> 01:40:10,338
We ain't got no choice.

1313
01:40:11,047 --> 01:40:14,551
Hilly Holbrook can't let nobody know
that pie story about her.

1314
01:40:14,717 --> 01:40:16,845
Exactly. If people find out
the terrible awful

1315
01:40:17,011 --> 01:40:19,264
was you and Miss Hilly
we in trouble there ain't words for.

1316
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:21,524
Right! But don't you see?

1317
01:40:21,682 --> 01:40:24,982
She gonna go to her grave convincing
folks this book ain't about Jackson.

1318
01:40:25,144 --> 01:40:27,897
Now, that keeps us safe. Insured.

1319
01:40:29,232 --> 01:40:30,609
No.

1320
01:40:31,651 --> 01:40:32,994
No, that's too dangerous.

1321
01:40:37,406 --> 01:40:40,785
Y'all two brought me into this,
but I'm gonna finish it.

1322
01:40:41,661 --> 01:40:45,006
Either put it in, or pull my parts
out altogether. Y'all pick!

1323
01:40:56,425 --> 01:40:59,395
Thank you, Tommy. I should be out
by 10:00. See you then.

1324
01:41:05,017 --> 01:41:08,692
This is Jolene French, reporting from
the African Children's Benefit Ball,

1325
01:41:08,854 --> 01:41:12,199
and I'm here with League President,
Miss Hilly Holbrook.

1326
01:41:12,358 --> 01:41:16,864
Thanks, Jolene. And I'm just so excited
for the auction tonight, aren't you?

1327
01:41:17,029 --> 01:41:18,997
I'm absolutely thrilled.

1328
01:41:19,865 --> 01:41:21,458
Scandalous!

1329
01:41:24,078 --> 01:41:25,079
Thank you.

1330
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:36,678
Hi!

1331
01:41:43,681 --> 01:41:45,354
Did you see what Miss Celia got on?

1332
01:41:45,516 --> 01:41:48,690
Lord, have mercy. Women better hold onto
their husbands tonight.

1333
01:41:50,146 --> 01:41:52,365
Miss Leefolt been working on that dress
for four weeks

1334
01:41:52,523 --> 01:41:53,649
and that's what she came up with?

1335
01:41:53,816 --> 01:41:56,490
Here.

1336
01:42:08,414 --> 01:42:09,586
Kiss me.

1337
01:42:43,574 --> 01:42:45,542
Everybody enjoying the evening?

1338
01:42:50,373 --> 01:42:53,377
Let's give a nice round of applause
for the help.

1339
01:42:57,129 --> 01:43:00,349
For all the men and women who have
helped make tonight possible.

1340
01:43:02,134 --> 01:43:04,978
A cause I'm sure is dear
to their hearts as well.

1341
01:43:07,431 --> 01:43:09,559
- Your cocktail.
- Thank you.

1342
01:43:11,185 --> 01:43:15,361
Honey, don't you think
you've had enough to drink?

1343
01:43:15,523 --> 01:43:17,241
I wish you'd try and eat something.

1344
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:19,619
I'm not having my stomach poke out.

1345
01:43:23,531 --> 01:43:27,411
OK, OK, everybody, quiet down.
I got the list of the winners!

1346
01:43:29,537 --> 01:43:30,789
OK.

1347
01:43:30,955 --> 01:43:35,711
The winner of the beautiful
mink car coat is...

1348
01:43:36,377 --> 01:43:37,594
...Charlotte Phelan!

1349
01:43:39,463 --> 01:43:41,215
Congrats, Miss Phelan.

1350
01:43:41,382 --> 01:43:43,555
Ladies, I hope
your husbands take note of that.

1351
01:43:45,094 --> 01:43:48,519
Now it's time for the baked goods.

1352
01:43:49,724 --> 01:43:51,647
Ooh, yummy, yummy!

1353
01:43:51,809 --> 01:43:55,029
The highest bid
in baked goods goes to

1354
01:43:55,187 --> 01:43:58,031
Minny Jackson's chocolate pie.

1355
01:43:59,817 --> 01:44:01,319
Congratulations...

1356
01:44:01,986 --> 01:44:03,704
...Hilly Holbrook!

1357
01:44:04,071 --> 01:44:08,247
- Oh! Hilly.
- That's funny.

1358
01:44:08,409 --> 01:44:10,082
I didn't bid on anything.

1359
01:44:10,244 --> 01:44:13,794
All right. And now it's time
for Danica's strawberry jam.

1360
01:44:13,956 --> 01:44:15,208
Shh!

1361
01:44:17,918 --> 01:44:19,795
Congratulations, Hilly!

1362
01:44:19,962 --> 01:44:23,091
I didn't know you were a fan
of Minny's pies.

1363
01:44:24,675 --> 01:44:27,144
I've been wanting to talk to you
all night.

1364
01:44:27,303 --> 01:44:29,271
Minny said why you won't be my friend.

1365
01:44:29,430 --> 01:44:31,683
It's 'cause you think me and Johnny
went behind your back.

1366
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:35,273
Wait. I want to talk...

1367
01:44:35,436 --> 01:44:36,813
Oh, no.

1368
01:44:36,979 --> 01:44:38,652
I'm so sorry.

1369
01:44:41,859 --> 01:44:43,611
Come here, sweetheart.

1370
01:44:43,778 --> 01:44:45,530
Let me bring you back to your table.

1371
01:44:47,990 --> 01:44:50,459
- I'm really sorry.
- It's all right. Don't worry about it.

1372
01:44:51,744 --> 01:44:55,339
What are you trying to do to me?
What are you and that nigra up to?

1373
01:44:55,498 --> 01:44:57,171
I don't know what you're talking about.

1374
01:44:57,333 --> 01:44:58,880
You liar! Who did you tell?

1375
01:44:59,043 --> 01:45:01,341
Hilly, I got pregnant
after you and Johnny broke up!

1376
01:45:01,504 --> 01:45:04,178
- Oh, shit!
- Shut up, Mother!

1377
01:45:04,340 --> 01:45:07,765
Johnny never cheated on you.

1378
01:45:08,677 --> 01:45:10,179
At least not with me.

1379
01:45:10,346 --> 01:45:13,725
Oh, Johnny would never cheat on me.

1380
01:45:13,891 --> 01:45:17,270
I'm so sorry! I thought you'd be tickled
you won that pie!

1381
01:45:18,145 --> 01:45:22,525
You tell that nigra, if she tells
anybody, I will make her suffer!

1382
01:45:22,691 --> 01:45:24,989
Hey, that is enough.

1383
01:45:25,569 --> 01:45:26,570
Celia.

1384
01:45:26,737 --> 01:45:28,239
Hey, baby, what's the matter?

1385
01:45:28,405 --> 01:45:30,999
- Oh!
- Cel?

1386
01:45:32,034 --> 01:45:33,035
Oh!

1387
01:45:34,662 --> 01:45:37,962
Oh, shit. What a mess. Napkins.

1388
01:45:39,458 --> 01:45:42,132
Why don't we get back to the auction?

1389
01:45:42,294 --> 01:45:45,218
- Next up, Debby's peppermint bark.
- Celia!

1390
01:45:45,798 --> 01:45:47,846
It goes great with hot cocoa.

1391
01:45:53,722 --> 01:45:55,941
Oh, just come on home with us
tonight, Mother.

1392
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:59,354
No, thanks. I've got a pie to eat.

1393
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:01,943
You throw that pie away right now.

1394
01:46:02,106 --> 01:46:04,234
I spent good money on this pie.

1395
01:46:05,150 --> 01:46:06,948
I won it just for you.

1396
01:46:07,111 --> 01:46:09,239
You signed me up?

1397
01:46:09,405 --> 01:46:13,455
I may have trouble remembering my own
name, or what country I live in,

1398
01:46:13,617 --> 01:46:16,040
but there are two things
I can't seem to forget:

1399
01:46:16,203 --> 01:46:19,753
that my own daughter
threw me into a nursing home,

1400
01:46:19,915 --> 01:46:21,917
and that she ate Minny's shit.

1401
01:46:23,002 --> 01:46:24,174
Good night.

1402
01:46:28,382 --> 01:46:31,852
- Hey, how about a nightcap?
- Let's go.

1403
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:42,150
I'm not right for this
kind of life, Minny.

1404
01:46:44,023 --> 01:46:47,197
I don't need a dining room table
for 12 people.

1405
01:46:48,027 --> 01:46:51,406
I couldn't get two people
over here if I begged.

1406
01:46:55,701 --> 01:46:58,045
I can't do this to Johnny any more.

1407
01:47:00,456 --> 01:47:02,754
That's why I've gotta go back
to Sugar Ditch.

1408
01:47:04,460 --> 01:47:06,679
You can't move back to Sugar Ditch.

1409
01:47:08,923 --> 01:47:10,971
Lord.

1410
01:47:11,634 --> 01:47:13,932
I reckon it's time you knew.

1411
01:47:14,094 --> 01:47:15,266
Sit down.

1412
01:47:25,981 --> 01:47:29,030
So Miss Hilly thought you knew about
the terrible awful.

1413
01:47:30,319 --> 01:47:32,321
That you was making fun of her.

1414
01:47:35,324 --> 01:47:37,873
It's my fault she pounced on you.

1415
01:47:40,371 --> 01:47:42,373
If you leave Mr. Johnny...

1416
01:47:44,708 --> 01:47:47,803
...then Miss Hilly done won
the whole ball game.

1417
01:47:49,964 --> 01:47:51,807
Then she done beaten me...

1418
01:47:53,217 --> 01:47:55,311
...and she done beat you.

1419
01:48:02,351 --> 01:48:04,900
Thank you for telling me that.

1420
01:48:12,403 --> 01:48:16,033
Lord, look at all these pages. 266.

1421
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:18,367
Mm-mm!

1422
01:48:19,618 --> 01:48:22,497
So we just send it off?
Just wait and see?

1423
01:48:22,663 --> 01:48:24,381
Hope Miss Stein gonna publish it?

1424
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:28,670
Well, I have one more story to type
before I put it in the mail,

1425
01:48:28,836 --> 01:48:30,338
but other than that, we're done.

1426
01:48:30,504 --> 01:48:32,097
Which one you got left?

1427
01:48:34,591 --> 01:48:35,763
Uh, mine.

1428
01:48:46,395 --> 01:48:48,864
I need to talk to you about Constantine.

1429
01:48:49,356 --> 01:48:53,361
Oh, Eugenia, that was so long ago.

1430
01:48:53,902 --> 01:48:55,074
What happened?

1431
01:48:55,237 --> 01:48:57,615
Oh.

1432
01:48:58,407 --> 01:49:00,250
What happened?

1433
01:49:04,997 --> 01:49:07,125
She didn't give me a choice.

1434
01:49:12,254 --> 01:49:17,181
The Daughters of America had just
appointed me state regent.

1435
01:49:19,970 --> 01:49:23,315
Grace Higginbotham, our esteemed
president, came all the way down

1436
01:49:23,474 --> 01:49:27,445
from Washington, D.C.,
to our house for the ceremony.

1437
01:49:29,063 --> 01:49:33,068
That's just beautiful. Look at that.

1438
01:49:36,570 --> 01:49:40,291
She'd gotten so old and slow, Skeeter.

1439
01:49:43,994 --> 01:49:45,211
Yes, ma'am.

1440
01:49:47,873 --> 01:49:51,298
It's such an honor
that you came all this way.

1441
01:50:00,010 --> 01:50:01,057
That's all right.

1442
01:50:05,891 --> 01:50:08,565
- Hello, Miss Charlotte.
- Rachel.

1443
01:50:10,604 --> 01:50:12,732
We were expecting you next week.

1444
01:50:12,898 --> 01:50:14,696
I decided to come early
and surprise Mama.

1445
01:50:14,858 --> 01:50:16,781
Oh.

1446
01:50:17,820 --> 01:50:19,197
I'm entertaining.

1447
01:50:19,363 --> 01:50:21,741
Why don't you go around back.
Wait in the kitchen.

1448
01:50:27,412 --> 01:50:28,709
Go on now.

1449
01:50:31,875 --> 01:50:33,377
I am sorry.

1450
01:50:36,338 --> 01:50:38,966
Rachel, what are you doing?

1451
01:50:39,133 --> 01:50:42,387
I'm just doing as I was told,
Miss Charlotte.

1452
01:50:42,553 --> 01:50:44,055
Going to the kitchen.

1453
01:50:44,221 --> 01:50:46,315
But I'm going to see my mama first.

1454
01:50:47,766 --> 01:50:50,519
Hello, Mama.

1455
01:50:50,686 --> 01:50:53,405
Go on to the kitchen, baby.
I'll be there directly.

1456
01:50:53,564 --> 01:50:57,740
You may put up with this kind
of nonsense, but I do not.

1457
01:51:04,449 --> 01:51:05,996
Get out of this house, Rachel.

1458
01:51:10,122 --> 01:51:12,500
You heard her. Go on, girl.

1459
01:51:12,666 --> 01:51:16,796
Miss Charlotte, let me take her to
the kitchen. Come on, baby. Let's go.

1460
01:51:18,672 --> 01:51:20,094
Charlotte.

1461
01:51:24,511 --> 01:51:26,434
Both of you.

1462
01:51:26,597 --> 01:51:29,225
Leave. Now.

1463
01:51:33,395 --> 01:51:34,738
Come on, Mama.

1464
01:52:07,262 --> 01:52:08,809
Come on now.

1465
01:52:22,444 --> 01:52:24,947
Constantine didn't do anything wrong.

1466
01:52:26,657 --> 01:52:28,580
And you love Rachel. I know you do.

1467
01:52:28,742 --> 01:52:31,916
She was our president.
What was I supposed to do?

1468
01:52:32,913 --> 01:52:37,259
She did you the biggest favor of
your life. She taught me everything.

1469
01:52:37,417 --> 01:52:40,591
Well, you idolized her too much.
You always have.

1470
01:52:40,754 --> 01:52:42,882
I needed someone to look up to.

1471
01:52:46,301 --> 01:52:47,678
Well, I...

1472
01:52:48,512 --> 01:52:52,187
I went to her house the next day,
but she had already gone.

1473
01:53:22,921 --> 01:53:24,468
How could you not tell me all this?

1474
01:53:24,631 --> 01:53:28,135
Because I didn't want to upset you
during your final exams.

1475
01:53:28,302 --> 01:53:31,021
I knew you'd blame me,
and it wasn't my fault!

1476
01:53:31,179 --> 01:53:32,772
I have to go find her. She needs me.

1477
01:53:32,931 --> 01:53:34,228
- Eugenia.
- What?

1478
01:53:36,143 --> 01:53:39,613
We sent your brother up to Chicago
to bring Constantine home.

1479
01:53:48,530 --> 01:53:49,952
When he got there...

1480
01:53:54,036 --> 01:53:55,583
...she had died.

1481
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:13,814
You broke her heart.

1482
01:54:19,394 --> 01:54:24,321
- I'm...
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

1483
01:54:27,402 --> 01:54:29,029
I'm sorry.

1484
01:55:24,835 --> 01:55:26,803
They printed a few thousand copies

1485
01:55:26,962 --> 01:55:30,307
with the worst advance Miss Stein
had ever seen.

1486
01:55:30,465 --> 01:55:33,093
Baby, what you doing with Alicia book?
You can't read.

1487
01:55:34,177 --> 01:55:39,525
They sent Miss Skeeter $600. She broke
that money up and gave it to each of us.

1488
01:55:40,350 --> 01:55:45,277
Divided 13 ways,
that came to about $46 each.

1489
01:55:51,361 --> 01:55:52,704
Y'all finish your homework.

1490
01:55:57,868 --> 01:56:00,462
Aibileen. Aibileen!

1491
01:56:01,288 --> 01:56:03,962
We just got this from Miss Skeeter.
Look at it.

1492
01:56:04,124 --> 01:56:05,671
Look at it.

1493
01:56:05,834 --> 01:56:07,552
Look at it!

1494
01:56:07,711 --> 01:56:09,679
Minny, we're rich!

1495
01:56:11,590 --> 01:56:15,060
"She fired me
for using her inside toilet.

1496
01:56:15,218 --> 01:56:19,974
Put me out in a storm and told me never
to come back. But I did come back.

1497
01:56:20,140 --> 01:56:24,316
I came back with a pie I had baked
to say I'm sorry.

1498
01:56:25,353 --> 01:56:26,696
I watched her eat..."

1499
01:56:37,073 --> 01:56:39,246
Well, it's a wonderful book, Hilly.

1500
01:56:39,409 --> 01:56:43,334
Filled with gripping testimonials
from Mississippi's housekeepers.

1501
01:56:44,164 --> 01:56:46,007
OK, Mama. I need to run.

1502
01:56:46,166 --> 01:56:50,967
Well. You should read the book, Hilly.
It's quite scandalous.

1503
01:56:51,129 --> 01:56:54,724
Sounds like... Jackson, if you ask me.

1504
01:56:55,217 --> 01:56:56,560
Quite scandalous.

1505
01:56:57,886 --> 01:56:59,138
What book?

1506
01:56:59,304 --> 01:57:00,521
What's it called again?

1507
01:57:00,764 --> 01:57:01,765
Uh...

1508
01:57:02,098 --> 01:57:04,817
The Help. H-E-L-P.

1509
01:57:32,587 --> 01:57:33,930
There it is.

1510
01:57:42,264 --> 01:57:43,732
You told me to write something good.

1511
01:57:43,890 --> 01:57:46,063
- Something I believed in.
- It's not what I believe in.

1512
01:57:46,226 --> 01:57:49,070
That joke you pulled with Hilly
with the toilets, that's funny.

1513
01:57:50,605 --> 01:57:52,573
Why would you do this to us?

1514
01:57:53,567 --> 01:57:55,160
I don't even know why you care.

1515
01:57:55,318 --> 01:57:58,162
- What?
- Things are fine around here.

1516
01:57:58,321 --> 01:57:59,743
Why go stir up trouble?

1517
01:57:59,906 --> 01:58:02,284
Trouble's already here, Stuart.

1518
01:58:02,450 --> 01:58:04,418
I had to tell you this.
You needed to know.

1519
01:58:04,578 --> 01:58:07,457
Goddamn right I needed to know. You
should have told me this from the start.

1520
01:58:12,252 --> 01:58:13,879
You're a selfish woman, Skeeter.

1521
01:58:15,755 --> 01:58:16,802
Stuart.

1522
01:58:16,965 --> 01:58:19,093
I think you're better off being alone.

1523
01:59:07,265 --> 01:59:08,812
Yeah.

1524
01:59:08,975 --> 01:59:11,728
Did you get to that part yet
that I was telling you about?

1525
01:59:11,895 --> 01:59:13,772
Don't read ahead, whatever you do.

1526
01:59:13,938 --> 01:59:16,236
"What you done put up in this?"

1527
01:59:16,399 --> 01:59:19,778
"She Said, 'My Shit."'

1528
01:59:34,668 --> 01:59:36,215
What's the matter, Hilly?

1529
01:59:37,712 --> 01:59:41,467
- Get off of me! Get off!
- Ouch! Stop hitting me!

1530
01:59:43,593 --> 01:59:46,221
I heard that Betty character
might be Mary Elizabeth.

1531
01:59:46,388 --> 01:59:48,766
It's not Jackson.

1532
01:59:48,932 --> 01:59:53,312
And that book is garbage. I bet the
whole thing is made up by some nigra.

1533
01:59:53,478 --> 01:59:55,401
And Jolene, didn't your mama

1534
01:59:55,563 --> 01:59:57,565
leave Cora to you in her will?

1535
01:59:57,732 --> 02:00:01,657
Yes, but that's not odd, is it?
Happens all the time, right?

1536
02:00:01,820 --> 02:00:04,539
The book is not about Jackson.

1537
02:01:29,449 --> 02:01:30,951
What the hell?

1538
02:01:32,285 --> 02:01:33,787
What are you doing here?

1539
02:01:35,663 --> 02:01:37,916
I've contacted my lawyer.

1540
02:01:38,082 --> 02:01:40,710
Hibbie Goodman? He's the best
libel attorney in the state.

1541
02:01:40,877 --> 02:01:42,504
Oh, Missy, you're going to jail.

1542
02:01:42,670 --> 02:01:44,422
You can't prove anything.

1543
02:01:44,589 --> 02:01:47,934
Oh, I 100 percent know you wrote it.
Nobody else in town is as tacky as you.

1544
02:01:48,092 --> 02:01:49,969
You don't know anything, Hilly.

1545
02:01:50,136 --> 02:01:51,638
Oh, I don't, do I?

1546
02:01:52,305 --> 02:01:55,354
You tell Aibileen the next time
she wants to write

1547
02:01:55,517 --> 02:01:58,396
about my dear friend Elizabeth...

1548
02:01:58,561 --> 02:02:02,486
Uh-huh.
Remember her? Had you in her wedding.

1549
02:02:02,649 --> 02:02:05,869
Let's just say Aibileen ought to have
been a little bit smarter

1550
02:02:06,027 --> 02:02:08,701
before putting in about that
L-shaped scratch

1551
02:02:08,863 --> 02:02:11,537
in poor Elizabeth's dining table.

1552
02:02:13,618 --> 02:02:17,418
And that nigger Minny,
do I have plans for her.

1553
02:02:18,081 --> 02:02:22,882
Careful, Hilly. That's chapter 12.

1554
02:02:23,044 --> 02:02:25,217
Don't give yourself away now.

1555
02:02:25,672 --> 02:02:27,299
That was not me!

1556
02:02:28,216 --> 02:02:30,389
I've come to tell your mother
what a hippie you've become.

1557
02:02:30,552 --> 02:02:32,600
She's going to be disgusted by you.

1558
02:02:32,762 --> 02:02:36,392
Why, Hilly. Is everything OK, you two?

1559
02:02:36,558 --> 02:02:37,559
Oh, Mrs. Phelan.

1560
02:02:37,725 --> 02:02:41,605
Hilly, you're a sweaty mess.
Are you ill?

1561
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:43,481
No, ma'am.

1562
02:02:43,648 --> 02:02:48,620
Darling, oh, no husband wants
to come home and see that.

1563
02:02:48,945 --> 02:02:50,572
Oh.

1564
02:02:50,738 --> 02:02:52,206
I didn't have time to get fixed up.

1565
02:02:52,365 --> 02:02:54,333
You know, Hilly, if I didn't
know any better,

1566
02:02:54,492 --> 02:02:58,167
I'd say you've been eating too much pie.

1567
02:03:02,625 --> 02:03:05,925
Mrs. Phelan, I came here...

1568
02:03:06,087 --> 02:03:08,590
In fact, I'm sure of it.

1569
02:03:08,756 --> 02:03:10,975
Now you get your raggedy ass
off my porch.

1570
02:03:11,634 --> 02:03:13,511
Go on.

1571
02:03:13,678 --> 02:03:16,773
Get off my property. Now!

1572
02:03:17,849 --> 02:03:21,103
Before we all get one of those
disgusting things on our lips!

1573
02:03:36,451 --> 02:03:39,705
Eugenia. Take me inside, please.

1574
02:03:40,830 --> 02:03:41,831
Yes, ma'am.

1575
02:03:57,472 --> 02:04:00,476
Skeeter, do you have plans tomorrow?

1576
02:04:01,184 --> 02:04:02,811
- No, ma'am.
- Good.

1577
02:04:04,520 --> 02:04:07,023
Because we are going shopping.

1578
02:04:08,942 --> 02:04:11,411
No single daughter of mine is
going to New York City

1579
02:04:11,569 --> 02:04:13,162
representing the great state
of Mississippi

1580
02:04:13,321 --> 02:04:15,744
without a proper cosmopolitan wardrobe.

1581
02:04:15,907 --> 02:04:17,284
How do you know about New York?

1582
02:04:17,450 --> 02:04:20,249
Oh, well, Miss Stein called last night.

1583
02:04:27,961 --> 02:04:30,885
Courage sometimes skips a generation.

1584
02:04:33,841 --> 02:04:36,640
Thank you for bringing it back
to our family.

1585
02:04:45,937 --> 02:04:48,065
I can't leave you like this.

1586
02:04:48,564 --> 02:04:51,693
Eugenia, I have made a decision.

1587
02:04:51,859 --> 02:04:54,328
My health's been on the uptick
these last few weeks,

1588
02:04:54,487 --> 02:04:57,661
and I know the doctor says it's
some kind of last strength nonsense,

1589
02:04:57,824 --> 02:05:02,250
but I have decided not to die.

1590
02:05:07,750 --> 02:05:08,922
Oh, Mama.

1591
02:05:09,085 --> 02:05:10,803
It's too late.
I tried calling Fanny Mae's

1592
02:05:10,962 --> 02:05:13,215
to make all your hair appointments
for the next 20 years,

1593
02:05:13,381 --> 02:05:15,804
but they wouldn't allow it.

1594
02:05:18,094 --> 02:05:22,565
I have never been more proud of you.

1595
02:05:27,478 --> 02:05:29,196
Thank you.

1596
02:05:37,822 --> 02:05:39,199
Mama.

1597
02:06:07,393 --> 02:06:08,895
Need some help with those?

1598
02:06:11,064 --> 02:06:12,281
Minny.

1599
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:14,317
- Miss Celia!
- Minny, hey, stop! Minny!

1600
02:06:14,484 --> 02:06:16,111
- Miss Celia!
- Minny!

1601
02:06:16,277 --> 02:06:20,157
- Stay back!
- I'm not here to hurt you! Girl...

1602
02:06:22,075 --> 02:06:23,748
You gonna put the stick down?

1603
02:06:23,910 --> 02:06:25,628
Uh-uh.

1604
02:06:28,289 --> 02:06:31,839
Listen, Celia finally told me
about the babies.

1605
02:06:33,044 --> 02:06:34,387
All of them.

1606
02:06:36,172 --> 02:06:39,847
But I also know, the minute
you started working here,

1607
02:06:40,009 --> 02:06:41,852
she started getting better.

1608
02:06:42,970 --> 02:06:44,813
So, you saved her life.

1609
02:06:48,267 --> 02:06:50,986
You knew I was here the whole time?

1610
02:06:51,145 --> 02:06:54,445
Fried chicken and okra
on the first night?

1611
02:06:55,650 --> 02:06:58,153
Y'all could have at least put
some cornpone on the table.

1612
02:07:00,863 --> 02:07:02,035
No.

1613
02:07:03,699 --> 02:07:06,043
I couldn't let you eat no more cornpone,
Mr. Johnny.

1614
02:07:06,202 --> 02:07:09,046
Thanks to you, now I've had to let out
every pair of pants I own.

1615
02:07:17,046 --> 02:07:19,390
You just leave that.

1616
02:07:20,049 --> 02:07:21,392
Here you go.

1617
02:07:22,385 --> 02:07:24,058
Let's head on up the house.

1618
02:07:48,744 --> 02:07:49,836
What's this?

1619
02:07:50,705 --> 02:07:52,378
I cooked it all by myself.

1620
02:07:52,540 --> 02:07:55,134
- Yes, she did.
- She was up all night.

1621
02:07:56,752 --> 02:07:58,846
I wanted to do something special.

1622
02:08:00,089 --> 02:08:02,217
I wanted to say thank you.

1623
02:08:05,386 --> 02:08:06,387
So...

1624
02:08:07,430 --> 02:08:09,023
...I ain't losing my job?

1625
02:08:11,017 --> 02:08:14,692
No, you got a job here
for the rest of your life.

1626
02:08:14,854 --> 02:08:16,071
If you want it.

1627
02:08:22,445 --> 02:08:24,539
That's a mile-high meringue, Miss Celia.

1628
02:08:33,998 --> 02:08:36,251
- Please.
- Thank you.

1629
02:08:40,254 --> 02:08:42,177
Ooh.

1630
02:08:42,340 --> 02:08:43,808
You remember to check the thighs?

1631
02:08:43,966 --> 02:08:47,561
- Mm-hm. Cooked clean through.
- Ain't pink in the middle?

1632
02:08:47,720 --> 02:08:50,894
Uh-uh. Just the way you taught me.

1633
02:08:51,057 --> 02:08:52,934
Looky here.

1634
02:08:56,771 --> 02:08:59,775
That table of food
gave Minny the strength she needed.

1635
02:09:00,858 --> 02:09:05,455
She took her babies out from under Leroy
and never went back.

1636
02:09:09,992 --> 02:09:12,620
What are all these cars
doing out here? Are we late?

1637
02:09:12,787 --> 02:09:14,130
No, we ain't late.

1638
02:09:15,748 --> 02:09:16,795
Why ain't you singing?

1639
02:09:16,958 --> 02:09:19,086
We got to worry about getting
in there and getting our seats.

1640
02:09:19,252 --> 02:09:20,469
Come on now, we late!

1641
02:09:29,428 --> 02:09:32,728
- Who we clapping for?
- Honey, we clapping for you!

1642
02:09:36,269 --> 02:09:37,987
Come on down, Sister Clark!

1643
02:09:38,896 --> 02:09:40,068
Come on.

1644
02:09:58,249 --> 02:09:59,671
Come on.

1645
02:10:02,461 --> 02:10:03,804
All right, all right.

1646
02:10:05,423 --> 02:10:10,600
Now, uh... this is an important time
in our community.

1647
02:10:11,387 --> 02:10:15,642
And we have to thank you
for what you have done.

1648
02:10:18,019 --> 02:10:19,145
Now...

1649
02:10:20,271 --> 02:10:22,899
We know you couldn't put
your name in here,

1650
02:10:24,317 --> 02:10:26,035
so we all signed our own.

1651
02:10:28,446 --> 02:10:29,538
Thank you.

1652
02:10:31,866 --> 02:10:35,666
Come on, now. Come on.

1653
02:11:13,240 --> 02:11:17,120
Churches over two counties
signed our books. All for you and me.

1654
02:11:21,123 --> 02:11:22,466
It's beautiful.

1655
02:11:25,795 --> 02:11:26,921
What's wrong?

1656
02:11:33,135 --> 02:11:35,604
I got a job offer from Harper and Row
in New York.

1657
02:11:36,222 --> 02:11:38,020
Congratulations!

1658
02:11:38,182 --> 02:11:41,777
- I'm not taking it.
- What you mean you're not taking it?

1659
02:11:41,936 --> 02:11:43,563
I can't just leave you two here

1660
02:11:43,729 --> 02:11:46,152
when things are getting bad
from the mess that I created.

1661
02:11:46,315 --> 02:11:51,071
No. If bad things happen,
ain't nothing you can do about it.

1662
02:11:51,237 --> 02:11:53,615
And now it's for a reason
we can be proud of.

1663
02:11:55,866 --> 02:11:57,868
I don't mean to rub salt in your wound,

1664
02:11:58,035 --> 02:12:00,504
but you ain't got a good life here
in Jackson.

1665
02:12:00,663 --> 02:12:02,131
Plus, your mama's getting better.

1666
02:12:02,289 --> 02:12:05,668
You ain't got nothing left here
but enemies in the Junior League.

1667
02:12:05,835 --> 02:12:07,758
You done burned every bridge there is.

1668
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:10,389
And you ain't never gonna
get another man in this town.

1669
02:12:10,548 --> 02:12:12,767
Everybody know that.

1670
02:12:12,925 --> 02:12:16,350
So don't walk your white butt
to New York, run it!

1671
02:12:18,347 --> 02:12:22,022
Looky here, Miss Skeeter.
I'm gonna take care of Aibileen.

1672
02:12:24,186 --> 02:12:25,984
And she's gonna take care of me.

1673
02:12:37,741 --> 02:12:40,210
Go find your life, Miss Skeeter.

1674
02:12:53,799 --> 02:12:56,177
Aibileen, can you come in here, please?

1675
02:13:02,308 --> 02:13:03,355
Good morning.

1676
02:13:04,101 --> 02:13:08,982
Aibileen, the silver
I lent Elizabeth last week.

1677
02:13:09,148 --> 02:13:11,242
It not polished good?

1678
02:13:11,400 --> 02:13:14,654
Humidity been fighting me
on polishing day.

1679
02:13:14,820 --> 02:13:19,496
When you returned it, three pieces
were missing from the felt wrapper.

1680
02:13:20,826 --> 02:13:24,080
A fork and two spoons.

1681
02:13:24,246 --> 02:13:27,796
Let me... Let me go check in the
kitchen. Maybe I left some behind.

1682
02:13:27,958 --> 02:13:31,007
You know as well as I do that silver's
not in the kitchen.

1683
02:13:33,339 --> 02:13:35,592
You check in Mae Mobley's bed?

1684
02:13:36,717 --> 02:13:38,811
Since the Lil Man was born,
she been putting things...

1685
02:13:38,969 --> 02:13:40,721
Do you hear her, Elizabeth?

1686
02:13:41,764 --> 02:13:43,562
She's trying to blame it on a toddler.

1687
02:13:45,726 --> 02:13:47,399
I ain't got no silver.

1688
02:13:47,561 --> 02:13:49,655
She says she doesn't have them.

1689
02:13:50,147 --> 02:13:54,402
Then it behooves me to inform you
that you are Tired, Aibileen.

1690
02:13:55,528 --> 02:13:57,701
And I'll be calling the police.

1691
02:13:59,615 --> 02:14:02,414
Aibee, my throat hurts.

1692
02:14:04,578 --> 02:14:07,297
I'll go get some syrup, Miss Leefolt.

1693
02:14:07,998 --> 02:14:10,501
Elizabeth can take care
of her own children.

1694
02:14:13,921 --> 02:14:16,765
- I'll go get the cough syrup.
- Come here, Lil Man.

1695
02:14:16,924 --> 02:14:18,346
I'm OK.

1696
02:14:28,727 --> 02:14:30,775
I didn't steal no silver.

1697
02:14:30,938 --> 02:14:34,659
Maybe I can't send you to jail
for what you wrote,

1698
02:14:34,817 --> 02:14:36,694
but I can send you for being a thief.

1699
02:14:36,860 --> 02:14:39,283
I know something about you.
Don't you forget that.

1700
02:14:39,989 --> 02:14:43,118
From what Yule Mae says, there's a lot
of time to write letters in jail.

1701
02:14:43,284 --> 02:14:46,959
Plenty of time to write the truth
about you. And the paper is free.

1702
02:14:47,121 --> 02:14:49,795
- Nobody will believe what you wrote!
- I don't know!

1703
02:14:50,332 --> 02:14:53,632
I been told I'm a pretty good writer.
Already sold a lot of books.

1704
02:14:58,382 --> 02:15:00,555
Call the police, Elizabeth.

1705
02:15:01,302 --> 02:15:04,021
All you do is scare and lie
to try to get what you want.

1706
02:15:04,179 --> 02:15:05,180
Aibileen, stop!

1707
02:15:05,347 --> 02:15:07,395
You a godless woman.

1708
02:15:09,435 --> 02:15:11,529
Ain't you tired, Miss Hilly?

1709
02:15:14,189 --> 02:15:15,532
Ain't you tired?

1710
02:15:28,954 --> 02:15:31,377
Aibileen, you have to go now.

1711
02:15:46,013 --> 02:15:48,436
Don't go, Aibee.

1712
02:15:49,642 --> 02:15:51,986
Baby, you need to get back to bed.

1713
02:15:52,519 --> 02:15:56,569
- Please don't leave.
- I gots to, baby. I am so sorry.

1714
02:15:56,732 --> 02:15:59,485
Are you going to take care
of another little girl?

1715
02:15:59,652 --> 02:16:01,620
No, that's not the reason.

1716
02:16:01,779 --> 02:16:05,329
I don't want to leave you,
but it's time for me to retire.

1717
02:16:05,491 --> 02:16:07,744
- You're my last little girl.
- No!

1718
02:16:07,910 --> 02:16:09,912
Baby. Baby.

1719
02:16:10,913 --> 02:16:13,416
I need you to remember everything
I told you, OK?

1720
02:16:13,582 --> 02:16:15,710
- OK.
- You remember what I told you?

1721
02:16:15,876 --> 02:16:21,303
You is kind. You is smart.

1722
02:16:21,465 --> 02:16:23,138
You is important.

1723
02:16:23,300 --> 02:16:25,177
That's right, Baby Girl.

1724
02:16:30,391 --> 02:16:31,859
Don't go, Aibee.

1725
02:16:32,017 --> 02:16:33,234
I gots to, baby.

1726
02:16:35,896 --> 02:16:37,819
You give my sweet girl a chance.

1727
02:16:54,123 --> 02:16:56,376
Mae Mobley was my last baby.

1728
02:16:58,836 --> 02:17:01,715
In just ten minutes,
the only life I knew was done.

1729
02:17:01,880 --> 02:17:04,599
Aibee!

1730
02:17:07,970 --> 02:17:10,064
God says we need to love our enemies.

1731
02:17:10,222 --> 02:17:11,565
No!

1732
02:17:13,475 --> 02:17:14,818
It hard to do.

1733
02:17:21,066 --> 02:17:23,194
But it can start by telling the truth.

1734
02:17:28,365 --> 02:17:31,960
No one had ever asked me
what it felt like to be me.

1735
02:17:35,330 --> 02:17:37,378
Once I told the truth about that...

1736
02:17:39,376 --> 02:17:41,049
...I felt free.

1737
02:17:49,470 --> 02:17:52,565
And I got to thinking
about all the people I know.

1738
02:17:54,600 --> 02:17:56,602
And the things I seen and done.

1739
02:18:02,357 --> 02:18:06,703
My boy, Treelore, always said we going
to have a writer in the family one day.

1740
02:18:10,032 --> 02:18:12,160
I guess it's gonna be me.
