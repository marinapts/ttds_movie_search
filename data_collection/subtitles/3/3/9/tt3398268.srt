00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:10,553
Studio Ghibli, Nippon Television Network, Dentsu,
Hakuhodo DYMP, Walt Disney Japan,
Mitsubishi, Toho and KDDI present

2
00:00:31,282 --> 00:00:35,286
<i>In this world,
there's an invisible magic circle.</i>

3
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:45,463
- So you did date him!
- What?

4
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:51,427
<i>There's inside and outside.</i>

5
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,764
Capture the movement.

6
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,557
- It's hard.
- Right?

7
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:59,602
- Let's see.
- Hey, no looking!

8
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:01,896
<i>These people are inside.</i>

9
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,777
<i>And I'm outside.</i>

10
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:11,155
<i>But I don't really care.</i>

11
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,783
How's it coming?

12
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:20,831
Um, I... kind of messed up.

13
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:23,125
Let me have a look.

14
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:36,806
Oh, no. Are you okay?

15
00:01:37,098 --> 00:01:38,474
<i>Hey, hey---</i>

16
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,318
<i>I...</i>

17
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:53,864
<i>I hate myself.</i>

18
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:14,677
Anna...

19
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:18,013
You're fine now.

20
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,892
Oh, I'm so glad.
Thank you, Doctor.

21
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:26,147
Anna, do you feel all right now?

22
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:27,523
I'm fine.

23
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:30,818
You looked like you were in agony.

24
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:32,862
Where was your inhaler?

25
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,699
I cost you money again.

26
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:39,243
Why do you say that?

27
00:02:42,872 --> 00:02:44,206
Oh, Miyoko.

28
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:48,627
I brought Anna's bag.
Her notebook is inside.

29
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,212
Why, thank you.

30
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:53,549
We were just nearby.
If there's anything else...

31
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:55,551
Wait...

32
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:59,346
Has Anna been getting along with you?

33
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:01,849
She tells me nothing about school.

34
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:03,726
She's okay.

35
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:05,853
But she's very quiet.

36
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:08,272
Quiet? More like...

37
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:10,065
Hey, don't.

38
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,860
We're just a bit loud.

39
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,864
Well, take care.

40
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:20,492
Ever the worrywart, your mother.

41
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:25,414
Mother. . .?

42
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:31,712
She's probably a hermit at school.

43
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:36,008
It's true that stress can
trigger asthma attacks.

44
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:39,303
Meanwhile, my husband's
off on a business trip.

45
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:44,058
Maybe he and I are
partly to blame, too.

46
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:46,393
12 years old...

47
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:48,729
It's a difficult age.

48
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:52,483
Have you noticed anything about her?

49
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:57,488
She... always has an ordinary face.

50
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,573
Ordinary face?

51
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:03,827
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,625
Like she won't show her emotions...

53
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,753
She used to be more expressive.

54
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:17,341
But these days, I don't even know...

55
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:24,848
Maybe it's because
we're not related by blood.

56
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:30,688
<i>You may want to send her
somewhere to get better.</i>

57
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,655
7:03 Departure for KUSHIRO

58
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,620
<i>Say, Anna...</i>

59
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:51,500
<i>Do you remember Uncle and Aunt Oiwa?</i>

60
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:56,630
<i>The air is very clean
where they live.</i>

61
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:04,513
<i>It'll help your condition
to spend some time there.</i>

62
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:10,602
<i>I can't go with you,
but they'll take care of you.</i>

63
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,815
<i>Be a good girl, eat well,</i>

64
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:17,026
<i>and come back nice and happy.</i>

65
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,866
<i>She whines like a goat.</i>

66
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,538
Oh, here she is.

67
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:13,832
Anna.

68
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:20,047
Remember us?

69
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:23,217
No, but Auntie told me
all about you.

70
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:24,843
I'm Anna Sasaki.

71
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,430
I hope I'm not much trouble.
Thank you for having me.

72
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:31,725
Our pleasure.

73
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:33,435
Auntie?

74
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:35,270
She means Yoriko.

75
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:42,444
Get on in. Sorry it's
a bit of a clunker.

76
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,579
Sorry it's tight in here.

77
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,248
I don't mind at all.

78
00:06:55,124 --> 00:07:00,170
This area's changed since I was
last here. All these new shops.

79
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:04,133
Where we're headed
is a nice, relaxing place.

80
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:08,804
But since the highway was built,
people stopped coming.

81
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:28,991
They still haven't fixed that pothole!

82
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:34,121
I hear you have asthma?

83
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:35,205
Uh,yes.

84
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,125
The wind here will
fix you up in no time.

85
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:50,012
Nice place, huh? Bet you'd
like Auntie to see it, too.

86
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:51,638
What's that over there?

87
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:54,016
On the cliff.

88
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:59,021
Oh, that's a silo.
It's for storing feed for livestock.

89
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:02,191
Hasn't been used in decades, though.

90
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,986
Now the village kids
use it for dares.

91
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:08,989
They say there are ghosts there.

92
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,991
Dear, please!

93
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:13,660
He loves stories like that.

94
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:15,787
Best to stay away from there.

95
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,045
Look, that's our house over there.

96
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:31,261
Here, mind taking this in?

97
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,513
What's this?

98
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:36,016
Why would you accept this?

99
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,686
It's too much for us to eat.

100
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:43,524
He's always accepting gifts
without thinking...

101
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,695
Our kids are all grown up
and moved out.

102
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,572
Make yourself at home.

103
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:51,490
Thank you.

104
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:54,451
Let's see, these go where...

105
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,537
Excuse me.

106
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:08,757
You must think it's an odd house.

107
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,093
No, it's a lovely home.

108
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,472
No need for flattery.

109
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,977
Your room's upstairs.

110
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,438
It was my daughter's room.

111
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:30,320
It'd be sad to clear everything,
so I left it as it was.

112
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:32,281
I see.

113
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:35,909
She's a yoga teacher in Tokyo now.

114
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:38,745
I'm thinking of trying it myself.

115
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:43,750
Oh, and feel free to use
the closet and shelves.

116
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:45,419
Oh, thank you.

117
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:58,348
“Write me how things are,
whatever you please. Yoriko”

118
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:02,436
Postcards, how quaint!
You should write her.

119
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:04,646
Come here for a sec!

120
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,273
Corning!

121
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,942
He can be so pushy.

122
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,652
See you later.

123
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,493
Smells like a stranger's house.

124
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,570
Feels nice.

125
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,323
<i>I've arrived safely.</i>

126
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,533
<i>It's quite nice here.</i>

127
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:02,162
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Oiwa are
both very kind.</i>

128
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,212
<i>To Yoriko Sasaki</i>

129
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:17,844
These are delicious.

130
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:21,014
Sorry, my hands are full.

131
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,850
Um, I'm going to the post office.

132
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,520
Sure, go on.

133
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:27,979
Won't you try this?

134
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:29,564
Later.

135
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:32,067
Okay, I'll save it for dessert.

136
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:43,870
By the way, there's a shortcut
by the parking lot.

137
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,038
Oh, thank you.

138
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,374
<i>SHORTCUT</i>

139
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,255
This is the shortcut?

140
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,915
Boys just drive me mad!

141
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:30,834
It's tough being
class president.

142
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,545
Wait, I need to drop off a letter.

143
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,554
Hey, who's that?

144
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,334
Why is it...

145
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:17,464
That mansion feels familiar.

146
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,998
I wonder if anyone lives here.

147
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:59,756
Excuse me...

148
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:17,357
What a big house.

149
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,933
I guess there's no one here.

150
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,515
Oh, no...

151
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:57,290
Thank you.

152
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:19,896
<i>He's a bear.
Or maybe a sea lion.</i>

153
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,884
Sounds like an adventure!

154
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:53,430
Completely different
in high tide, isn't it?

155
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,890
It's the power of the moon.

156
00:16:56,516 --> 00:17:00,270
But imagine that, Toichi giving
a girl a ride on his boat.

157
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:04,858
He's actually a good guy.
Just not much of a talker.

158
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,904
You should ask him for a ride again.

159
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:12,615
Ask him for a ride.

160
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:15,744
I Will.

161
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:20,790
But it's best you stay away
from The Marsh House.

162
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,210
How come?

163
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,671
Ghosts.

164
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:27,505
Not again!

165
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,967
I'll get some wine.

166
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,887
Looked like no one lives there.

167
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:35,597
Not now, anyway.

168
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:40,435
Used to be a vacation home
for some foreigners.

169
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:43,813
Then it changed hands a few times.

170
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,900
But it's been vacant
for a while now.

171
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,611
I see...

172
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,015
Someone's there.

173
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,518
Have you finished them yet?

174
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:06,688
What Mrs. Kadoya asked for.

175
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:08,356
Oh... Almost done.

176
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,859
Hey, Anna. Going out?

177
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:12,193
Yes.

178
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:14,863
Just finish them already...

179
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:18,366
I'm going to go sketch.

180
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:19,868
Sure, go on.

181
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:21,035
Thank you.

182
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:30,211
Yoriko was worried about her,
but she looks fine to me.

183
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:33,715
As long as she's having fun
and eating well.

184
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:35,550
That's for sure.

185
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:43,391
All the trash you pick up
will be collected here.

186
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:45,894
Everyone listen!

187
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,395
Now begin!

188
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,567
Look, it's Toichi.

189
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:53,985
Toichi the mute!

190
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:57,405
Toichi who only talks once a decade!

191
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:00,909
Hey, I said we're not going
there until later!

192
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:03,077
We're just checking it out!

193
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:04,287
See ya!

194
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:07,582
Perhaps we'll hear
from you next time!

195
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:09,978
I'm going out.

196
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:12,313
Wait, Anna.

197
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,986
I have a little errand,
so hold on.

198
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:21,656
Yes.

199
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:27,161
He should be delivering
these himself.

200
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:30,164
“I'm allergic to that lady,” he says!

201
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:33,751
But Mrs. Kadoya's been
wanting to meet you.

202
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:37,839
Their daughter Nobuko
is a year older than you.

203
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:43,678
Nobuko is at cram school today.

204
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:45,680
Oh, that's too bad.

205
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:48,766
This must be Anna.
Nice to meet you.

206
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:53,021
Oh, um... Hello.

207
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:56,024
Ah, so you draw, I see?

208
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:57,692
Show me next time.

209
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,819
No, I'm not very good.

210
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:06,284
Oh, you should go to the Tanabata
Festival with Nobuko tomorrow.

211
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:10,204
Great idea! I should still
have my daughter's yukata.

212
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:13,207
You can wear it to the festival.

213
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,043
But...

214
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:17,545
Yes.

215
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:20,548
I'll let Nobuko know.
Now come in.

216
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:22,508
Where'd I put it...

217
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,552
Uh, actually I...

218
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:27,555
Oh, you're going sketching.
Go ahead!

219
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:31,893
She'll look great!

220
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:34,062
Ready,and“.

221
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:36,230
- This one, too.
- Got it.

222
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:38,566
I won't look good in it.

223
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:41,402
None of her business.

224
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:55,249
He's not here.

225
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:25,279
- Bye.
- See you tomorrow.

226
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,311
The tide is out.

227
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:21,002
Again.

228
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:32,513
I hate festivals.

229
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:42,023
Hey, let's go.

230
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:43,524
Wait for me.

231
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:46,319
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

232
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:48,529
- Here's some candy.
- Thanks.

233
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:53,367
I wish I was wearing a yukata, too.

234
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:55,369
At least you're comfortable.

235
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:58,289
Mom forces her tastes on me.
It's awful.

236
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,208
I think it looks cute.

237
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:02,043
What? No way!

238
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,213
It's boring and tacky...

239
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:08,049
So Anna, where are you from?

240
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:09,884
From Sapporo.

241
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:13,221
Cool, I bet the city
has great shopping.

242
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:15,389
Maybe lots of cute boys, too?

243
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:17,225
You be quiet.

244
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:18,392
Sure, sure.

245
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:21,395
Not much to choose from
here in the boonies.

246
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,398
Why'd you come out here?

247
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:26,400
Well...

248
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:29,237
What's this? Nobuko!

249
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:30,363
What is it?

250
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:34,909
He's always making
the same mistakes.

251
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:37,078
I'll warn him next time.

252
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:45,378
There it is.

253
00:25:45,503 --> 00:25:47,004
Will my wish come true?

254
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:50,091
Can I have a candle?

255
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:51,717
Here you go.

256
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:02,770
Write your wish on this.

257
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:07,441
My wish...

258
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,779
Ow!

259
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:13,948
Sorry about that.

260
00:26:17,285 --> 00:26:18,327
Anna!

261
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:22,331
Hey, where were you?
I was looking for you.

262
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,458
Oh, your wish.

263
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:26,294
Let's see...

264
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:30,381
“I wish for a normal life everyday.”

265
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:32,300
“Normal”?

266
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:35,136
Anna, what do you mean by normal?

267
00:26:35,303 --> 00:26:36,345
Uh, well...

268
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:37,930
You see, urn...

269
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:39,849
Hey, your eye color!

270
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:41,809
What?

271
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:44,103
It's really pretty.

272
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:45,980
It's a bit blue, like a foreign...

273
00:26:46,147 --> 00:26:47,648
Leave me alone!

274
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:50,568
You fat Pig!

275
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:54,488
Fat...

276
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,492
Uh... I mean...

277
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:02,663
I see what you mean by normal.

278
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:08,002
But there's no use
pretending to be normal.

279
00:27:08,336 --> 00:27:12,006
After all, you look
like just what you are.

280
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:17,345
Okay, now let's drop it.

281
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,680
You should join us next...

282
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:22,516
Anna!

283
00:27:23,184 --> 00:27:24,518
Hey, watch it!

284
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:36,697
<i>Like just what I am...</i>

285
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:04,141
<i>Like just what I am...</i>

286
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,561
<i>UQ/V, Stupid,</i>

287
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:09,897
<i>moody,</i>

288
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:12,024
<i>unpleasant...</i>

289
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:15,569
<i>That's why...</i>

290
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:19,073
<i>I hate myself.</i>

291
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:23,244
<i>That's why everyone...</i>

292
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:30,584
We don't have long to live.
Typically, you're the ones who...

293
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:32,753
Still talking about that?

294
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,548
We already settled this matter.

295
00:28:35,673 --> 00:28:38,259
We're not blaming you.
It's just that...

296
00:28:38,426 --> 00:28:41,595
I've already told you.
It's not about money.

297
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:43,264
I feel bad for her, but...

298
00:28:43,431 --> 00:28:46,100
It'll be best for her if you two...

299
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,288
I'd better get home.

300
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:34,482
Did someone row it here?

301
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,208
It's stuck!

302
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:42,550
Throw me the rope!

303
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,218
The rope?

304
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:48,556
Hurry!

305
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,255
Are you okay?

306
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,593
Yeah. Oh, urn...

307
00:31:27,428 --> 00:31:29,263
Are you a real person?

308
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:31,432
Don't let anyone hear.

309
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,436
You look like the girl
I saw in my dreams.

310
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,271
Dreams?

311
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:52,953
Thanks.

312
00:31:57,458 --> 00:31:58,792
It's not a dream.

313
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:07,468
What's your name?

314
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:08,969
Anna.

315
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:12,222
I'm desperate to get to know you.

316
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:13,974
What about you?

317
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:16,143
Yes.

318
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:19,772
Have you seen me before?

319
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:21,815
Yes.

320
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:23,484
Often.

321
00:32:24,485 --> 00:32:28,656
I just got here.
How long have you been here?

322
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:30,824
I've been here for ages...

323
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:48,717
Look at this, the marsh at night.

324
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:53,514
How beautiful. Say, let's go
down for a closer look.

325
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:54,598
Madam.

326
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,017
I know.

327
00:32:57,351 --> 00:33:00,521
By the way, where's that child?

328
00:33:00,688 --> 00:33:03,023
Was she not in her room?

329
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:08,529
I need to get back.

330
00:33:08,988 --> 00:33:10,656
Were they talking about you?

331
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:11,699
Yes.

332
00:33:13,534 --> 00:33:16,537
Usually I'm in bed by this hour.

333
00:33:19,123 --> 00:33:21,542
Come on, I'll row you back.

334
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:24,294
So it was your boat.

335
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:27,715
Yes, I left it for you on purpose.

336
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:34,555
But I thought you'd
row a little better.

337
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:40,060
I know. So did I.

338
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:45,065
You're my precious secret.

339
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:49,695
I haven't told anyone about you,
and I won't.

340
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:53,657
If someone finds out,
they'll only spoil it.

341
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:03,584
Please, promise me.

342
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:06,420
That we'll remain a secret.

343
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:08,255
Forever.

344
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:10,758
Yes.

345
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:13,719
It'll be our secret.

346
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,012
Forever.

347
00:34:57,805 --> 00:35:01,642
It was awful. She came home
crying her eyes out!

348
00:35:02,643 --> 00:35:04,144
Did Anna do something?

349
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,980
She called my daughter a fat pig!

350
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:08,982
Fat Pig?

351
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,779
And she pulled out
a cutter, too. The horror!

352
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:14,863
I doubt she'd...

353
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:17,991
No, you need to hear it
from the girl herself.

354
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,868
Now bring her here.

355
00:35:20,828 --> 00:35:22,996
Seems she's not home yet.

356
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:27,835
She's a delinquent,
out and about this late!

357
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:31,004
You two are at fault, too!

358
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,007
Better keep an eye on her.

359
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:39,179
Take this. It's dark.

360
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:40,681
No, thank you.

361
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:46,687
What if something happens
to one of the kids?

362
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:51,024
So what if she's a bit late!

363
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:52,693
Don't get so riled up.

364
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:55,028
She is not a delinquent.

365
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:58,031
Ah, she's home.

366
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:00,200
Anna.

367
00:36:01,535 --> 00:36:02,369
Aunt Oiwa...

368
00:36:02,536 --> 00:36:05,831
Were you listening?
Don't you worry.

369
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:09,543
You two'll make up.

370
00:36:10,294 --> 00:36:12,880
Now take a bath and have dinner.

371
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:13,881
Thank you.

372
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:17,050
Or is it dinner
before the bath?

373
00:36:17,301 --> 00:36:19,219
It hardly matters.

374
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:22,723
But “fat pig” is a bit harsh.

375
00:36:24,558 --> 00:36:25,726
That's for sure.

376
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:27,561
It's not that funny.

377
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:48,081
Auntie, worrying like always.

378
00:36:52,336 --> 00:36:54,796
Anna! Watermelon!

379
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:01,720
Anna?

380
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:07,726
Two hours until high tide...

381
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:54,147
Hop in. Time for a picnic.

382
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:56,608
I brought juice and cookies.

383
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:59,778
Picnic? At this hour?

384
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:02,781
That's right.
Let's go across the marsh.

385
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:17,546
You're very good at rowing.

386
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,508
You need rowing lessons.

387
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,884
Come here.

388
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:28,974
It's easy.

389
00:38:36,315 --> 00:38:41,194
Remember I said last night
that you're my precious secret?

390
00:38:43,155 --> 00:38:46,533
I remember. And you're my secret.

391
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:48,327
I'm glad.

392
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:51,204
Hey!

393
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:59,004
Good, you're doing well.

394
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:06,386
But I don't even know
your name yet.

395
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:11,558
I hadn't told you?

396
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:13,602
Marnie.

397
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:15,854
I thought you already knew.

398
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:19,191
That's dangerous.

399
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:30,494
Go ahead, just row.

400
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:50,889
There's so much I want
to know about you.

401
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:54,059
But I want to find out slowly.

402
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:57,562
Slowly, by myself, as we go along.

403
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,064
Okay.

404
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,733
I'll tell you what we'll do.

405
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:06,947
We'll ask each other
three questions a night.

406
00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:07,948
Great.

407
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:10,575
All right, I'll start.

408
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:14,579
Question one. Why are you
here in this village?

409
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:17,499
I have asthma.

410
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:22,587
The doctor said I should go somewhere
with clean air for a while.

411
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,132
Even by skipping school.

412
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:26,758
Oh no, you're ill?

413
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,635
If there's no attack, I'm fine.

414
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:33,265
So I'm staying here with
Auntie's relatives, the Oiwas.

415
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:34,641
Who's Auntie?

416
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:36,643
It's my turn to ask now.

417
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:39,521
Do you live in that mansion?

418
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:42,232
Ever since I was two.

419
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:44,443
With Nan and the maids.

420
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:46,445
It's juice.

421
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,448
Where are your parents?

422
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:54,119
They only come here sometimes.
They're busy with work.

423
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:55,454
I see.

424
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:58,623
Question two. Who's Auntie?

425
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:01,543
My guardian.

426
00:41:02,419 --> 00:41:07,466
But I was a worry to her,
so she got rid of me for a while.

427
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:09,009
What do you mean?

428
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:11,303
I'll explain sometime.

429
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,513
It's my turn now.

430
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:15,849
<i>Do you have siblings?</i>

431
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:17,476
<i>I'm an only child.</i>

432
00:41:17,601 --> 00:41:19,311
<i>I see, you too...</i>

433
00:41:19,478 --> 00:41:20,520
<i>How come?</i>

434
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,690
<i>Oh, it's nothing.</i>

435
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:27,652
Just curious what it's like
to have siblings.

436
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,656
I know, it'd be fun to imagine that.

437
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,700
All right, question three.

438
00:41:34,201 --> 00:41:36,870
What's it like living at the Oiwas?

439
00:41:37,496 --> 00:41:38,705
At the Oiwas?

440
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,084
<i>Huh...</i>

441
00:41:44,336 --> 00:41:45,504
<i>How strange...</i>

442
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:47,839
<i>I can't...</i>

443
00:41:48,882 --> 00:41:50,175
<i>remember...</i>

444
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:27,963
Marnie?

445
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:32,717
Marnie!

446
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:33,969
Anna!

447
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:40,100
There you are.
I wondered where you went.

448
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:44,437
Marnie?

449
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:53,655
I looked all over for you.
You just disappeared.

450
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:55,907
I didn't go anywhere.

451
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:58,618
I was just trying to
answer your question.

452
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:00,996
Wait...

453
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:03,081
What was it?

454
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:06,251
It's okay, it doesn't matter.

455
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:08,753
I need to go soon. Today is...

456
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:13,049
Oh, I know!

457
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:19,180
No no no, I really can't!
Parties aren't really my...

458
00:43:19,306 --> 00:43:20,599
Don't worry.

459
00:43:21,725 --> 00:43:23,602
I have a great idea.

460
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:00,305
It's true.

461
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:02,098
That's hard to believe.

462
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:18,990
Sorry, did you wait long?
I had trouble getting away.

463
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:20,825
Marnie.

464
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:23,328
What do you think?

465
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:25,830
It's pretty.

466
00:44:26,665 --> 00:44:30,710
I borrowed Nan's shawl.
I'll be scolded again.

467
00:44:31,503 --> 00:44:32,545
This won't work.

468
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:35,507
Don't worry, I spoke to Father.

469
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:43,348
Young lady.

470
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:47,352
I believe it is past your bedtime.

471
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:50,021
And who might this be?

472
00:44:52,649 --> 00:44:54,567
She is wearing my shawl.

473
00:44:56,695 --> 00:44:57,529
Upstairs!

474
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:00,365
Wait right there!

475
00:45:14,254 --> 00:45:17,048
You must be up to no good again.

476
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:19,050
You go that way.

477
00:45:22,721 --> 00:45:24,055
Marnie!

478
00:45:25,432 --> 00:45:26,558
Why you little...

479
00:45:37,569 --> 00:45:40,321
Marnie! Open it!

480
00:45:40,447 --> 00:45:41,281
Let's go.

481
00:45:41,448 --> 00:45:43,241
If you keep this up,

482
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:45,910
you'll grow up to be
a lousy adult!

483
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:56,880
Everyone, we have a
lovely flower girl here.

484
00:45:57,756 --> 00:45:59,257
A guest of my daughter.

485
00:45:59,424 --> 00:46:00,800
Ah, a flower girl.

486
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:04,429
- There's Marnie.
- She'll be pretty like her mother.

487
00:46:04,596 --> 00:46:07,974
May I please have
one of those flowers?

488
00:46:09,434 --> 00:46:10,602
My mother.

489
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:21,946
Hello, dear little witch.

490
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:25,950
That woman there's the real witch.

491
00:46:35,585 --> 00:46:38,713
I want only one, for good luck.

492
00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:43,301
Will someone kindly pay
for my flower?

493
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:48,306
If it is the witch's command...

494
00:46:49,098 --> 00:46:50,683
Then I'll have one, too.

495
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:53,478
- Here.
- For superb luck.

496
00:46:57,482 --> 00:46:58,817
Ah, it's begun.

497
00:47:04,197 --> 00:47:05,156
I'm sorry!

498
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:06,366
Oh, she ran away.

499
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:25,218
Come take one for luck!

500
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:42,902
Young lady.

501
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:45,363
To your health.

502
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:49,033
Thank you.

503
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:10,221
Wine?

504
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:23,484
Awake now?

505
00:48:26,029 --> 00:48:27,113
I...

506
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:29,908
Drunkard.

507
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:34,913
Who was that?

508
00:48:35,288 --> 00:48:36,456
Which one?

509
00:48:36,581 --> 00:48:38,124
The one dancing with you.

510
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:42,295
You mean Kazuhiko?
An old friend.

511
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,757
He's a good dancer.

512
00:48:46,883 --> 00:48:48,009
So are you.

513
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:54,974
Now let's dance, you and I.

514
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:01,105
I can't dance.

515
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:03,107
Just follow my lead.

516
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:02,500
Look for me again.

517
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:07,171
And don't tell anyone. Promise.

518
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,214
I know.

519
00:50:11,551 --> 00:50:13,553
Hey, wait...

520
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:34,032
Is that...?

521
00:50:39,037 --> 00:50:41,080
It's the girl with the Oiwas.

522
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:14,238
I see. Hope you find the other shoe.

523
00:51:15,073 --> 00:51:16,908
It must be somewhere.

524
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:18,910
I'll go look.

525
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:21,287
Used to always lose mine.

526
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:25,083
There's a bunch buried
in the mud flats.

527
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:27,085
Don't compare her to you.

528
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:30,421
I should have
my daughter's old shoes.

529
00:51:30,922 --> 00:51:32,298
I'll get them out.

530
00:51:32,924 --> 00:51:34,425
Thank you.

531
00:51:52,777 --> 00:51:53,945
Marnie...

532
00:52:29,147 --> 00:52:30,481
Wow.

533
00:52:32,108 --> 00:52:35,862
Not only are they big,
they're delicious, too.

534
00:52:52,587 --> 00:52:54,714
You're good with the knife.

535
00:52:54,964 --> 00:52:57,466
Auntie teaches me all the time.

536
00:52:57,842 --> 00:53:01,554
You're so polite
and well-behaved.

537
00:53:02,013 --> 00:53:04,348
My daughter could learn from you.

538
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:07,185
Passing behind you.

539
00:53:07,852 --> 00:53:11,606
I remember when you first
came to Yoriko's place.

540
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:14,192
She was ecstatic.

541
00:53:15,318 --> 00:53:21,199
She wanted to make up for the
five years she didn't have with you.

542
00:53:22,742 --> 00:53:26,913
So she taught you things,
like knife skills.

543
00:53:31,209 --> 00:53:33,377
But she worries too much.

544
00:53:34,879 --> 00:53:37,048
Always calling me for help.

545
00:53:37,215 --> 00:53:40,551
When I told her I was busy,
she started pouting.

546
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:43,262
Oh, I shouldn't share this
about your mother.

547
00:53:44,889 --> 00:53:46,557
No, I understand.

548
00:53:47,058 --> 00:53:51,270
<i>You know, Yoriko sent us
tons of photos of you.</i>

549
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:53,606
I'll show you later.

550
00:53:57,068 --> 00:53:58,236
Hey, look.

551
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:02,281
Found the wind chime
I made on our honeymoon.

552
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:05,910
To survive the summer.

553
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:10,414
Your hair's getting long.

554
00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:12,959
Shall I give you a haircut?

555
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:15,253
That would be a disaster.

556
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:44,448
Mar... nie...?

557
00:54:45,408 --> 00:54:46,993
<i>Look for me again.</i>

558
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:56,502
<i>How could I nearly
forget about Marnie?</i>

559
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:14,478
<i>Marnie...</i>

560
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:20,526
<i>Marnie!</i>

561
00:55:26,157 --> 00:55:27,491
Marnie...

562
00:56:05,488 --> 00:56:06,906
May I?

563
00:56:09,033 --> 00:56:10,034
Sure.

564
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:12,953
I see you draw, too.

565
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:16,374
That girl looks like
someone I knew.

566
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:18,250
She was a great girl.

567
00:56:20,044 --> 00:56:21,921
Yes, she is.

568
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:25,966
But I haven't seen her in a week.

569
00:56:27,385 --> 00:56:31,222
I wonder if she's upset that I forgot.

570
00:56:32,598 --> 00:56:35,893
If she's a friend,
talk to her and you'll be fine.

571
00:56:37,686 --> 00:56:39,730
Say, will you take a look?

572
00:56:40,231 --> 00:56:41,232
Sure.

573
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:52,118
Are the colors too messy?

574
00:56:52,243 --> 00:56:54,412
No, it's wonderful.

575
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:56,455
I'm Hisako.

576
00:56:56,580 --> 00:57:00,418
I'm in love with The Marsh House.
What about you?

577
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:04,338
I'm Anna. I love it, too.

578
00:57:11,262 --> 00:57:14,432
Better hurry and finish your drawing...

579
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:16,934
before the new folks move in.

580
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:19,270
The renovations are under way.

581
00:57:23,107 --> 00:57:26,277
Thanks for your hard work.
Have some tea.

582
00:57:26,444 --> 00:57:29,113
Oh, thank you. Appreciate it.

583
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:32,491
Hey, let's take a break!

584
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:34,452
All right, coming.

585
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:48,132
Are you Marnie?

586
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:55,222
Come.

587
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:12,323
I hadn't seen the front before.

588
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:15,576
It's a lot cleaner now,
but not done yet.

589
00:58:17,828 --> 00:58:19,246
Hello.

590
00:58:19,455 --> 00:58:20,706
Hey there.

591
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:22,833
Brought a friend, huh?

592
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:26,170
Choose your slippers.

593
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:28,047
A Quest?

594
00:58:28,214 --> 00:58:29,215
Yeah, a secret one.

595
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:30,716
Secret?

596
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:32,343
Hey!

597
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:35,179
Sorry, make yourself at home.

598
00:58:36,514 --> 00:58:38,182
Thank you.

599
00:58:42,186 --> 00:58:45,022
Yes, it's a lovely place.

600
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:48,567
Yes, we're still in
the middle of renovation.

601
00:58:49,151 --> 00:58:50,528
This room...

602
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:55,032
Upstairs.

603
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,786
This hasn't been renovated yet.

604
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,042
Here, this is my room.

605
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:09,088
Really...

606
00:59:13,676 --> 00:59:14,718
What do you think?

607
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:17,429
It's a cute room.

608
00:59:19,223 --> 00:59:21,725
It used to be your room, right?

609
00:59:23,227 --> 00:59:24,395
You're...

610
00:59:25,271 --> 00:59:26,564
Marnie, right?

611
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:29,900
Me? No, no!

612
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:33,779
But... then why have you been
staring at my room?

613
00:59:33,946 --> 00:59:34,655
Because“.

614
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:37,908
See, that's where I always see you.

615
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:40,828
I've seen you many times.

616
00:59:42,788 --> 00:59:43,914
No, no.

617
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:47,251
I just love this mansion, that's all.

618
00:59:47,418 --> 00:59:48,544
That can't be.

619
00:59:49,587 --> 00:59:52,923
When I said Marnie earlier,
you were surprised.

620
00:59:53,132 --> 00:59:56,010
Rather, why do you know Marnie?

621
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:02,808
I found it behind the shelf.

622
01:00:04,602 --> 01:00:05,769
A diary?

623
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:08,439
That's right. Your diary.

624
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,615
Marnie!

625
01:00:19,617 --> 01:00:23,162
I'll pour you some
Queen Mary, your favorite.

626
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:25,539
I'll be back.

627
01:00:31,462 --> 01:00:34,173
<i>“Last night I went for
a row in my nightie.”</i>

628
01:00:35,674 --> 01:00:39,178
<i>“The marsh and the moon
were very pretty at night.”</i>

629
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:41,889
<i>I shall do it again.</i>

630
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:47,311
<i>June 8th. A party!</i>

631
01:00:48,187 --> 01:00:53,150
<i>Father, Mother and many of their
friends came. It was such fun.</i>

632
01:00:55,027 --> 01:00:56,695
<i>I went outside from the sunroom</i>

633
01:00:57,655 --> 01:01:01,033
<i>and danced with a flower girl.</i>

634
01:01:03,452 --> 01:01:04,411
<i>But...</i>

635
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:09,667
<i>Nan locked me in my room
because of last night.</i>

636
01:01:11,043 --> 01:01:14,880
<i>So there won't be any
midnight rows for a bit.</i>

637
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:25,182
See, it's you, isn't it?

638
01:01:27,518 --> 01:01:28,686
No.

639
01:01:29,561 --> 01:01:30,729
Marnie is...

640
01:01:31,438 --> 01:01:32,856
Marnie is...

641
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:36,568
someone I made up.

642
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:41,365
An imaginary girl, only in my mind.

643
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:45,577
But this is Marnie's diary.

644
01:01:46,787 --> 01:01:49,873
It's as if she really lived here.

645
01:01:52,543 --> 01:01:54,920
So you're not Marnie?

646
01:01:55,087 --> 01:01:55,879
No.

647
01:01:56,004 --> 01:01:57,881
She's just imaginary?

648
01:01:58,215 --> 01:01:59,091
That's right.

649
01:02:01,552 --> 01:02:05,264
I thought you were Marnie,
back for her diary...

650
01:02:09,393 --> 01:02:12,730
I'm Anna. I came from
Sapporo to get better.

651
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:15,315
I'm Sayaka.

652
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:18,110
I'm from Tokyo.

653
01:02:19,236 --> 01:02:24,074
But if she was imaginary,
why is her name the same?

654
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:26,493
I don't know.

655
01:02:26,952 --> 01:02:31,457
Marnie must be real.
I'm going to investigate.

656
01:02:44,762 --> 01:02:47,765
<i>Say, Marnie...</i>

657
01:02:49,224 --> 01:02:52,311
<i>Who are you?</i>

658
01:03:14,166 --> 01:03:15,292
Is that me?

659
01:03:23,467 --> 01:03:24,718
Marnie?

660
01:03:25,177 --> 01:03:26,470
Marnie!

661
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:42,277
Wait, that one's not done yet...

662
01:03:42,861 --> 01:03:45,280
Wow, you draw well.

663
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:47,157
Oh, thanks...

664
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:51,995
I've never had anyone
draw me before. How nice!

665
01:04:00,504 --> 01:04:01,922
I missed you.

666
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,344
I kept calling you in my heart.

667
01:04:11,682 --> 01:04:12,808
Me, too.

668
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:14,184
Let's go.

669
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:15,561
Come to my room.

670
01:04:16,728 --> 01:04:19,565
Come to my room, Marnie.

671
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:25,737
I can't go far from the mansion.

672
01:04:27,823 --> 01:04:32,077
Okay then, we'll go
wherever you want.

673
01:05:01,773 --> 01:05:03,817
<i>You know a lot about mushrooms.</i>

674
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:07,738
<i>Father taught me when I was little.</i>

675
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:11,575
<i>I once brought home
three bags full of mushrooms.</i>

676
01:05:12,910 --> 01:05:15,412
The look on Mother's face!

677
01:05:24,129 --> 01:05:27,424
What's wrong?
So quiet all of a sudden.

678
01:05:29,593 --> 01:05:31,595
You're very lucky.

679
01:05:31,929 --> 01:05:34,932
I wish I was you.

680
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:46,068
Talk to me.

681
01:05:49,237 --> 01:05:50,447
I'm...

682
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:53,867
a foster child.

683
01:05:55,953 --> 01:05:59,665
My real parents died
when I was little.

684
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:01,792
My grandmother, too.

685
01:06:02,918 --> 01:06:06,046
I know they didn't
die on purpose, but...

686
01:06:06,964 --> 01:06:08,548
sometimes I feel like...

687
01:06:10,008 --> 01:06:11,301
I can't forgive them...

688
01:06:11,969 --> 01:06:14,346
for leaving me all alone.

689
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:20,811
I'm jealous of you.

690
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:23,647
You're lucky to be a foster child.

691
01:06:24,439 --> 01:06:26,650
If you had no relatives,

692
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:30,654
then the folks who took
you in as a daughter

693
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:33,865
must be truly kindhearted people.

694
01:06:45,043 --> 01:06:47,671
Then I'll tell you a big secret.

695
01:06:49,047 --> 01:06:54,594
It's about my foster parents.
They're good to me and they're kind.

696
01:06:55,554 --> 01:07:00,434
I'm not their real child, yet they
raised me, which I appreciate.

697
01:07:02,728 --> 01:07:05,522
But you see, I saw it one day.

698
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:09,067
They're paid money for it.

699
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:11,695
<i>Money?</i>

700
01:07:12,029 --> 01:07:14,614
<i>I found a letter from the government.</i>

701
01:07:16,658 --> 01:07:20,871
<i>It said they were increasing
the subsidy for me.</i>

702
01:07:22,581 --> 01:07:24,458
<i>I'm sure there's a reason...</i>

703
01:07:24,583 --> 01:07:26,418
<i>I don't care!</i>

704
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:33,008
<i>They wouldn't get money if
I were their real child.</i>

705
01:07:34,259 --> 01:07:38,388
<i>They get paid because
I'm not their real child.</i>

706
01:07:40,724 --> 01:07:46,104
<i>Even worse...
they hide it from me.</i>

707
01:07:47,898 --> 01:07:49,232
I see.

708
01:07:50,901 --> 01:07:54,654
But that doesn't mean
Auntie doesn't love you.

709
01:07:54,946 --> 01:07:57,407
No! Don't you see?

710
01:07:57,574 --> 01:08:01,661
None of the other families
receive money. Just us!

711
01:08:02,537 --> 01:08:07,250
She always looks worried
that I might find out.

712
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:11,296
And I hate myself for
thinking like this.

713
01:08:12,089 --> 01:08:15,175
I... just can't... believe...

714
01:08:15,467 --> 01:08:17,427
in anything anymore.

715
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:30,273
Anna, it's okay to cry.

716
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,442
Just know that I love you.

717
01:08:34,653 --> 01:08:38,824
I love you more than
any girl I've ever known.

718
01:08:41,785 --> 01:08:44,663
Then you tell me your secret next.

719
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:52,129
It was long ago that I went
mushrooming with Father.

720
01:08:53,505 --> 01:08:56,508
Nowadays, I hardly see my parents.

721
01:08:58,301 --> 01:09:00,220
<i>Mother's usually travelling.</i>

722
01:09:05,267 --> 01:09:08,812
<i>Because of Work,
Father's home only twice a year.</i>

723
01:09:10,272 --> 01:09:14,651
<i>Usually, Nan and the twin maids
are the only ones home.</i>

724
01:09:14,985 --> 01:09:16,987
<i>And me.</i>

725
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:21,158
<i>I slip out while they're gossiping.</i>

726
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:25,579
<i>And look how free I get to be!</i>

727
01:09:28,957 --> 01:09:32,169
It's lovely when
my parents come home.

728
01:09:32,961 --> 01:09:34,504
They host parties!

729
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:37,549
Like the other day.

730
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:40,844
With my amazing parents

731
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:44,764
and many people there,
it's delightful.

732
01:09:45,473 --> 01:09:49,060
I get to wear new dresses
and dance, too.

733
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:55,734
That's when I'm sure I'm
the luckiest girl in the world.

734
01:09:57,194 --> 01:09:58,445
I see.

735
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:13,335
Tell me, Anna. Will you
be my friend forever?

736
01:10:14,044 --> 01:10:14,920
Yes.

737
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:16,880
I'm your friend forever.

738
01:10:18,215 --> 01:10:19,758
Right?

739
01:10:23,511 --> 01:10:25,555
<i>Nan's always in a bad mood.</i>

740
01:10:25,847 --> 01:10:30,393
<i>She yanks me by the arm,
brushes my hair very hard...</i>

741
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:33,563
<i>No one thinks I'm being bullied.</i>

742
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:36,066
<i>But it really hurts.</i>

743
01:10:37,067 --> 01:10:38,235
Enough to cry.

744
01:10:40,779 --> 01:10:43,281
The maids love to frighten me.

745
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:46,952
They threatened me
all the time.

746
01:10:48,119 --> 01:10:50,163
“Naughty kids get shut in the silo

747
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:53,708
“where ghosts suck out
their souls,” they said.

748
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:57,587
You mean, the silo on the hill?

749
01:10:57,921 --> 01:11:01,091
Once, they actually took me there.

750
01:11:01,967 --> 01:11:02,842
No!

751
01:11:02,968 --> 01:11:05,971
<i>They dragged me
all the way to the silo.</i>

752
01:11:06,263 --> 01:11:08,139
<i>I thought I'd die of fright.</i>

753
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:09,766
<i>Then suddenly,</i>

754
01:11:10,058 --> 01:11:14,604
<i>just as we got there, the sky
went dark and the thunder came.</i>

755
01:11:18,108 --> 01:11:21,152
<i>The maids were terrified,
so we didn't go inside.</i>

756
01:11:22,654 --> 01:11:25,740
I can endure anything else.

757
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:29,619
Anything but the silo.

758
01:11:30,412 --> 01:11:33,290
I never heard such a terrible thing!

759
01:11:33,498 --> 01:11:36,668
I hope the maids and Nan
get struck by lightning!

760
01:11:38,503 --> 01:11:42,757
Hasn't anyone ever
tried to frighten you?

761
01:11:43,341 --> 01:11:46,177
Never. Definitely not on purpose.

762
01:11:47,846 --> 01:11:49,681
You're lucky.

763
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:53,059
I wish I was you.

764
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:57,188
Our castle...

765
01:12:00,275 --> 01:12:01,985
Poor Marnie.

766
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:05,071
I love you the most, too.

767
01:12:05,405 --> 01:12:07,490
More than anyone I've known.

768
01:12:09,993 --> 01:12:11,244
Thank you.

769
01:12:16,875 --> 01:12:20,712
Funny, it's like we traded places.

770
01:12:21,421 --> 01:12:23,006
How true.

771
01:12:30,221 --> 01:12:31,931
The tide's coming in.

772
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:36,186
Hey, let's go to the silo together.

773
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:41,358
The ghosts must be a lie.
Let's go make sure.

774
01:12:42,484 --> 01:12:45,695
Tomorrow... No, let's go right now.

775
01:12:52,827 --> 01:12:55,330
<i>I don't care who Marnie really is.</i>

776
01:12:56,706 --> 01:12:59,793
<i>I just want to help her.</i>

777
01:13:11,596 --> 01:13:13,431
Are you okay, Marnie?

778
01:13:14,265 --> 01:13:17,977
Yes, I'm sure I'll be
all right if I'm with you...

779
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:19,729
Kazuhiko.

780
01:13:29,197 --> 01:13:31,282
Anna!

781
01:13:32,075 --> 01:13:35,120
Perfect timing! I found it!

782
01:13:45,130 --> 01:13:48,174
The rest of the diary.
Come to my place.

783
01:13:48,425 --> 01:13:49,968
Marnie...

784
01:13:51,344 --> 01:13:54,097
I'm sorry. Another time.

785
01:13:54,597 --> 01:13:57,183
What? But it's a major discovery...

786
01:13:58,518 --> 01:14:00,770
It's going to rain!

787
01:14:55,033 --> 01:14:56,034
Who is it?

788
01:14:58,453 --> 01:14:59,871
Is someone there?

789
01:15:00,205 --> 01:15:01,539
Marnie!

790
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:09,380
So you did go ahead.
Don't scare me like that.

791
01:15:12,383 --> 01:15:13,343
Marnie.

792
01:15:17,472 --> 01:15:19,390
Are you okay? Why did you...

793
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:20,517
Kazuhiko!

794
01:15:21,726 --> 01:15:25,063
I'm frightened.
I heard somebody below.

795
01:15:25,897 --> 01:15:28,983
I thought I'd die of fright.
Kazuhiko...

796
01:15:29,901 --> 01:15:34,155
What're you saying? I'm Anna.
Pull yourself together.

797
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:36,741
Anna... Anna!

798
01:15:37,158 --> 01:15:39,744
I don't want to be humiliated.

799
01:15:39,911 --> 01:15:41,412
But I haven't the courage.

800
01:15:41,579 --> 01:15:42,747
Oh, Anna...

801
01:15:43,998 --> 01:15:46,751
You do have courage.
You came here.

802
01:15:49,087 --> 01:15:50,088
Let's go home.

803
01:16:04,269 --> 01:16:05,436
Wait!

804
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:11,943
It's just the wind. Let's go.

805
01:16:12,777 --> 01:16:14,612
We'll go home together.

806
01:16:33,965 --> 01:16:36,050
Anna, come back here.

807
01:16:36,467 --> 01:16:37,468
Anna!

808
01:16:38,344 --> 01:16:41,472
We made it up. I'm sure
we can make it down.

809
01:16:42,432 --> 01:16:44,809
I'll go first, so follow me.

810
01:16:46,811 --> 01:16:49,480
No, don't leave me!

811
01:16:58,656 --> 01:16:59,490
No!

812
01:17:02,994 --> 01:17:04,162
Marnie!

813
01:17:06,164 --> 01:17:07,999
Let's go over there.

814
01:17:21,512 --> 01:17:24,015
I'm cold... So cold...

815
01:17:27,769 --> 01:17:32,023
Oh Anna, I'm scared...
I'm scared...

816
01:17:32,357 --> 01:17:35,693
Don't worry, we'll be fine
if we're together.

817
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:39,030
You did well, Marnie.

818
01:18:20,738 --> 01:18:22,073
Are you okay?

819
01:18:23,241 --> 01:18:24,575
Kazuhiko!

820
01:18:25,576 --> 01:18:27,453
I thought you'd never come.

821
01:18:28,579 --> 01:18:30,748
I... I...

822
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,425
Let's go home.

823
01:19:05,116 --> 01:19:06,451
Marnie?

824
01:19:09,287 --> 01:19:10,788
Marnie!

825
01:19:17,795 --> 01:19:20,465
Marnie!

826
01:19:27,388 --> 01:19:30,892
<i>Marnie... You left me behind!</i>

827
01:19:37,815 --> 01:19:39,650
<i>Even you!</i>

828
01:20:06,093 --> 01:20:08,638
Kazuhiko... Kazuhiko...

829
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:11,849
Kazuhik0's all over this diary.

830
01:20:13,559 --> 01:20:18,022
“Kazuhiko is trying to
take me to the silo.”

831
01:20:18,648 --> 01:20:19,857
Silo...

832
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:23,569
Yes?

833
01:20:24,862 --> 01:20:26,823
Mom cooked some corn.

834
01:20:27,532 --> 01:20:29,033
Hurry or it'll be gone.

835
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:29,951
Wait!

836
01:20:32,036 --> 01:20:34,539
Why go out on a night like this?

837
01:20:35,373 --> 01:20:36,207
It's not safe.

838
01:20:36,374 --> 01:20:41,379
My friend might be caught in the rain.
What if she gets pneumonia?

839
01:20:45,633 --> 01:20:46,717
Is that...

840
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:48,970
Anna!

841
01:20:49,554 --> 01:20:50,555
Are you okay?

842
01:20:53,057 --> 01:20:54,225
So cruel...

843
01:20:55,726 --> 01:20:57,228
Anna?

844
01:20:58,771 --> 01:21:00,982
So cruel, Marnie...

845
01:21:01,566 --> 01:21:03,067
She has a high fever!

846
01:21:03,234 --> 01:21:04,569
<i>I'll</i> g0 get help.

847
01:21:05,736 --> 01:21:07,071
Anna.

848
01:21:10,074 --> 01:21:11,409
Anna?

849
01:21:13,327 --> 01:21:14,745
Anna...

850
01:21:20,918 --> 01:21:22,587
How's she doing?

851
01:21:24,422 --> 01:21:26,424
Her fever's not coming down.

852
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:30,428
<i>She did get a shot earlier.</i>

853
01:21:30,845 --> 01:21:32,263
<i>I see.</i>

854
01:21:43,774 --> 01:21:44,942
<i>So cruel...</i>

855
01:21:48,112 --> 01:21:50,615
Marnie, how could you?

856
01:21:55,286 --> 01:21:56,954
<i>I won't forgive you.</i>

857
01:21:58,247 --> 01:22:00,458
<i>Leaving me behind without a word.</i>

858
01:22:25,691 --> 01:22:28,486
Anna! My dear Anna!

859
01:22:30,488 --> 01:22:34,492
Marnie! How could you
leave me behind?

860
01:22:35,076 --> 01:22:36,869
Why did you betray me?

861
01:22:37,662 --> 01:22:40,873
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to leave you all alone.

862
01:22:41,999 --> 01:22:42,833
But...

863
01:22:45,211 --> 01:22:48,506
But at that moment,
you weren't there.

864
01:22:49,715 --> 01:22:51,133
What do you mean?

865
01:22:51,842 --> 01:22:54,345
Oh, Anna, I...

866
01:22:55,304 --> 01:22:57,682
I can't stay here any longer.

867
01:22:58,182 --> 01:23:01,185
I have to say goodbye to you.

868
01:23:02,186 --> 01:23:06,357
So please, Anna,
please say you forgive me!

869
01:23:10,861 --> 01:23:12,196
Anna...

870
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:17,702
Of course, I forgive you!

871
01:23:18,035 --> 01:23:20,538
I love you, Marnie!

872
01:23:20,871 --> 01:23:23,165
And I won't forget you!

873
01:23:23,541 --> 01:23:26,252
I'll never forget you! Ever!

874
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:09,253
Anna.

875
01:24:16,302 --> 01:24:18,012
Sayaka's here for you.

876
01:24:21,474 --> 01:24:22,516
Thanks.

877
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:27,938
You could see her in your room.

878
01:24:28,105 --> 01:24:30,441
No, it's nice outside.

879
01:24:30,775 --> 01:24:33,527
<i>The view here is beautiful.
I'd love to show you. - Anna</i>

880
01:24:34,195 --> 01:24:35,613
Sayaka.

881
01:24:36,447 --> 01:24:38,115
Here, a get-well gift.

882
01:24:38,282 --> 01:24:39,617
Thanks.

883
01:24:39,742 --> 01:24:40,785
Also...

884
01:24:43,537 --> 01:24:47,792
This is what made me think
you might be at the silo.

885
01:24:47,958 --> 01:24:48,959
What is it?

886
01:24:49,126 --> 01:24:52,421
The rest of the diary
you promised to read.

887
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:56,300
I'm having trouble remembering.

888
01:24:56,467 --> 01:24:58,177
I impressed myself.

889
01:24:58,594 --> 01:25:02,473
I found a clue in this painting
that was behind the cupboard.

890
01:25:03,724 --> 01:25:05,976
Maybe I'm psychic.

891
01:25:06,644 --> 01:25:08,145
Turn it over.

892
01:25:13,651 --> 01:25:15,486
Hisako!

893
01:25:18,906 --> 01:25:20,658
Hisako!

894
01:25:35,714 --> 01:25:39,176
Please, will you tell us
about Marnie?

895
01:25:39,885 --> 01:25:40,928
But...

896
01:25:41,846 --> 01:25:43,681
it's a rather sad story.

897
01:25:44,515 --> 01:25:46,016
I'm ready for it.

898
01:25:50,646 --> 01:25:53,524
It was a long time ago.

899
01:25:55,234 --> 01:25:58,863
<i>I used to play at
The Marsh House often.</i>

900
01:26:00,865 --> 01:26:03,200
<i>Marnie and I were very little.</i>

901
01:26:03,367 --> 01:26:04,535
It's a bear!

902
01:26:04,702 --> 01:26:06,036
Let me see.

903
01:26:06,495 --> 01:26:09,540
This is Daddy. Isn't he dashing?

904
01:26:09,999 --> 01:26:12,293
<i>Marnie loved to boast about</i>

905
01:26:12,418 --> 01:26:16,046
<i>her glamorous parents and
their extravagant parties.</i>

906
01:26:19,508 --> 01:26:22,720
<i>But the truth is,
she was being neglected.</i>

907
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:28,559
Goodbye, Marnie.

908
01:26:28,726 --> 01:26:30,186
<i>That poor child...</i>

909
01:26:30,311 --> 01:26:35,399
No, don't leave me, Mommy!
Don't go!

910
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:38,569
<i>Seems even the maids
were bullying her.</i>

911
01:26:39,236 --> 01:26:40,571
That's awful!

912
01:26:41,822 --> 01:26:44,575
<i>Later, Marnie moved to Sapporo</i>

913
01:26:44,742 --> 01:26:47,578
<i>and married Kazuhiko,
her childhood friend.</i>

914
01:26:50,998 --> 01:26:54,376
<i>With her family torn apart
and feeling lost,</i>

915
01:26:54,501 --> 01:26:57,087
<i>he was there to support her.</i>

916
01:26:58,672 --> 01:27:02,760
<i>I'm glad. So Kazuhiko was a good man.</i>

917
01:27:04,678 --> 01:27:07,598
<i>Two years later, Emily was born.</i>

918
01:27:08,432 --> 01:27:13,938
<i>At last in the warm household she'd
always wanted, Marnie was happy.</i>

919
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:20,110
I didn't see Marnie for
many years after that.

920
01:27:21,403 --> 01:27:22,947
The next time was...

921
01:27:23,197 --> 01:27:27,284
a few years after Kazuhiko
had died of an illness.

922
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:31,413
By then,

923
01:27:32,206 --> 01:27:37,461
Marnie was in a sanatorium
due to the shock of his death.

924
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:39,296
Sanatorium?

925
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:42,424
A place where you go to get better.

926
01:27:43,801 --> 01:27:45,970
What happened to Emily?

927
01:27:46,637 --> 01:27:51,642
Marnie's parents had died,
leaving no one to look after her.

928
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:58,983
<i>So for elementary school,
she was sent to a boarding school.</i>

929
01:28:07,658 --> 01:28:12,496
<i>By the time she returned at age 73,
she had become a different person.</i>

930
01:28:13,038 --> 01:28:14,331
Emily!

931
01:28:14,456 --> 01:28:17,167
<i>She was willful and independent.</i>

932
01:28:18,043 --> 01:28:19,628
<i>She knew Marnie was ill,</i>

933
01:28:19,753 --> 01:28:24,174
<i>but still resented her
for sending her away.</i>

934
01:28:25,175 --> 01:28:28,220
You think that makes you
more motherly?

935
01:28:28,345 --> 01:28:31,974
I want you to live the way
you wish, but...

936
01:28:32,391 --> 01:28:33,517
you need to...

937
01:28:33,684 --> 01:28:36,854
<i>They never did make up after that.</i>

938
01:28:37,021 --> 01:28:37,980
As your mother...

939
01:28:38,105 --> 01:28:41,025
I've never thought of you
as a mother.

940
01:28:42,526 --> 01:28:46,363
<i>Emily ran away and
soon g0! married.</i>

941
01:28:47,614 --> 01:28:49,700
<i>She was expecting, you see.</i>

942
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:11,388
<i>But...</i>

943
01:29:13,724 --> 01:29:19,229
<i>One day, Emily and her husband
died in a car accident.</i>

944
01:29:22,649 --> 01:29:25,152
<i>I heard Marnie took their child in.</i>

945
01:29:27,446 --> 01:29:32,409
<i>She was determined to never
let this child be lonely.</i>

946
01:29:34,203 --> 01:29:35,079
<i>But...</i>

947
01:29:35,579 --> 01:29:39,208
<i>she never got over losing Emily.</i>

948
01:29:40,709 --> 01:29:44,922
<i>She became very ill,
and died the next year.</i>

949
01:29:47,257 --> 01:29:50,260
<i>That was about ten years ago.</i>

950
01:29:55,808 --> 01:29:58,435
I'm sorry, it's a sad story.

951
01:29:58,644 --> 01:30:01,271
No, thank you very much.

952
01:30:02,773 --> 01:30:05,943
Marnie adored that mansion.

953
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:11,949
She loved seeing the marsh
from her window.

954
01:30:13,659 --> 01:30:17,454
She said it felt like
the birds spoke to her.

955
01:30:19,456 --> 01:30:22,126
She had a lonely life,

956
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:24,461
but she lived it fully.

957
01:30:25,337 --> 01:30:28,966
Always with a smile,
determined to be happy.

958
01:30:31,635 --> 01:30:33,929
So you've met Marnie, too.

959
01:30:54,158 --> 01:30:57,327
<i>Wish we could've played more, Anna.</i>

960
01:30:57,661 --> 01:31:00,664
The plan was always
just for the summer.

961
01:31:01,498 --> 01:31:03,500
Will you come again next summer?

962
01:31:03,959 --> 01:31:06,336
I'm sure I will. I'll write you.

963
01:31:06,670 --> 01:31:09,506
I'll write you, too.

964
01:31:13,677 --> 01:31:17,014
I put the diary and painting
back where I found them.

965
01:31:17,306 --> 01:31:19,349
Good, it's for the best.

966
01:31:20,017 --> 01:31:21,852
I haven't told my family.

967
01:31:22,644 --> 01:31:24,521
Let's keep it our secret.

968
01:31:27,524 --> 01:31:28,859
How funny...

969
01:31:30,694 --> 01:31:33,572
Marnie brought us together.

970
01:31:34,364 --> 01:31:35,365
That's true.

971
01:31:37,326 --> 01:31:38,368
Marnie...

972
01:31:41,997 --> 01:31:46,210
The girl trapped behind
the blue window...

973
01:31:47,711 --> 01:31:49,546
That was long ago.

974
01:31:54,218 --> 01:31:58,055
<i>Exactly, he does it to
save her life.</i>

975
01:31:58,222 --> 01:31:59,556
<i>I love that part.</i>

976
01:31:59,723 --> 01:32:02,726
<i>Ah, now I want to
read it all over again.</i>

977
01:32:03,519 --> 01:32:05,229
I'll loan you Volume 2.

978
01:32:05,395 --> 01:32:06,730
Anna!

979
01:32:10,734 --> 01:32:11,902
Auntie!

980
01:32:14,738 --> 01:32:16,073
Anna...

981
01:32:18,242 --> 01:32:20,244
Hey, be careful!

982
01:32:20,410 --> 01:32:21,745
Sorry, sorry.

983
01:32:28,877 --> 01:32:30,587
Auntie's here.

984
01:32:31,421 --> 01:32:34,258
Ah, Yoriko, you're here.

985
01:32:36,927 --> 01:32:38,762
Thank you for everything.

986
01:32:38,929 --> 01:32:42,266
She's doing well,
and even made a friend.

987
01:32:42,933 --> 01:32:44,601
How can I ever repay you?

988
01:32:44,726 --> 01:32:48,605
Oh, no. We didn't do
anything at all.

989
01:32:48,939 --> 01:32:50,732
Anna is a good girl.

990
01:32:50,857 --> 01:32:54,111
It was like having
our own daughter back.

991
01:32:54,903 --> 01:32:56,113
She's welcome anytime.

992
01:32:56,822 --> 01:32:57,948
Thank you.

993
01:32:58,198 --> 01:32:59,449
Let's talk inside.

994
01:33:02,286 --> 01:33:05,789
I'm impressed you didn't
call us this time.

995
01:33:19,303 --> 01:33:20,971
I'm all packed.

996
01:33:21,972 --> 01:33:22,806
Anna.

997
01:33:24,433 --> 01:33:25,309
Yes?

998
01:33:26,643 --> 01:33:30,147
There's something
I need to tell you.

999
01:33:32,149 --> 01:33:36,653
We receive monthly subsidies
to cover your expenses.

1000
01:33:37,154 --> 01:33:38,655
We receive money.

1001
01:33:39,156 --> 01:33:42,284
I've long hesitated
to tell you, but...

1002
01:33:42,409 --> 01:33:44,786
- It's okay.
- But believe me...

1003
01:33:44,995 --> 01:33:47,497
Whether or not we receive money,

1004
01:33:47,831 --> 01:33:49,916
it doesn't change our love for you.

1005
01:33:51,335 --> 01:33:52,669
I already knew.

1006
01:33:53,170 --> 01:33:55,672
I'm happy you told me about it.

1007
01:33:55,839 --> 01:33:56,840
Anna!

1008
01:34:01,845 --> 01:34:05,182
I've been looking at
the photos you sent.

1009
01:34:06,350 --> 01:34:07,351
Photos?

1010
01:34:07,684 --> 01:34:12,356
Oh, while you were away
I was looking at old albums

1011
01:34:12,522 --> 01:34:14,191
and found this picture.

1012
01:34:14,524 --> 01:34:15,692
Do you remember?

1013
01:34:18,695 --> 01:34:20,030
It's that mansion.

1014
01:34:20,197 --> 01:34:23,825
When you first came,
you wouldn't let it go.

1015
01:34:26,370 --> 01:34:28,330
I was told at the orphanage

1016
01:34:29,122 --> 01:34:31,375
it belonged to your grandmother.

1017
01:34:35,712 --> 01:34:38,882
<i>My beloved home - Marnie</i>

1018
01:34:40,008 --> 01:34:41,218
Marnie!

1019
01:35:20,090 --> 01:35:22,259
So that's who she was.

1020
01:35:24,761 --> 01:35:25,762
Anna.

1021
01:35:29,266 --> 01:35:33,603
<i>And so I was in
the silo all night.</i>

1022
01:35:33,937 --> 01:35:36,440
I was very frightened.

1023
01:35:37,149 --> 01:35:39,776
That's when your grandpa came.

1024
01:35:40,444 --> 01:35:43,613
He encouraged me,
saying I did well.

1025
01:35:44,281 --> 01:35:47,784
I've overcome many
frightening things.

1026
01:35:47,951 --> 01:35:49,786
And so will you, Anna.

1027
01:35:50,954 --> 01:35:51,955
After all,

1028
01:35:52,289 --> 01:35:56,960
you're my one and only grandchild.

1029
01:35:59,629 --> 01:36:00,964
Grandma...

1030
01:36:45,842 --> 01:36:46,676
Excuse me.

1031
01:36:49,012 --> 01:36:50,013
Anna.

1032
01:36:51,515 --> 01:36:53,517
I'm sorry for what I said.

1033
01:36:55,852 --> 01:36:58,188
Don't skip trash pickup next year.

1034
01:37:05,862 --> 01:37:06,696
A friend?

1035
01:37:07,030 --> 01:37:08,031
Maybe.

1036
01:37:14,871 --> 01:37:16,373
Hisako!

1037
01:37:20,043 --> 01:37:21,211
Anna.

1038
01:37:21,711 --> 01:37:24,214
I'm going home to Sapporo now.

1039
01:37:24,381 --> 01:37:25,882
Is that right?

1040
01:37:26,466 --> 01:37:30,053
But your face tells me
something good happened.

1041
01:37:30,554 --> 01:37:33,390
Yes, I'm really happy now.

1042
01:37:33,682 --> 01:37:34,724
Good.

1043
01:37:35,725 --> 01:37:38,061
Um, this is my mother.

1044
01:37:39,271 --> 01:37:42,566
Thank you for being kind to Anna.

1045
01:37:43,108 --> 01:37:45,068
Oh no, it was my pleasure.

1046
01:37:45,694 --> 01:37:47,904
Let's draw together again.

1047
01:37:48,071 --> 01:37:48,905
Yes.

1048
01:37:49,072 --> 01:37:52,242
I'll write you.
I have some amazing news.

1049
01:37:52,409 --> 01:37:53,243
Goodbye.

1050
01:37:55,579 --> 01:37:57,747
Thank you very much.

1051
01:38:03,169 --> 01:38:04,588
Amazing news?

1052
01:38:04,754 --> 01:38:06,923
Yeah, I'll tell you later.

1053
01:38:07,257 --> 01:38:08,758
Oh, why not now?

1054
01:38:08,925 --> 01:38:10,760
I promise I'll tell you.

1055
01:38:21,938 --> 01:38:26,109
