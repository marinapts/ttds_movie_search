2
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,890
So it's 6 PM in the night time...

3
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,600
... which is when I wake up.

4
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,730
This is always really scary part for me.

5
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,260
Yes! Night time.

6
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:08,330
So, now I'm going to wake up 
 my flat mates.

7
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,720
<i>I really love living in a flatting situation.</i>

8
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,740
Wake up!

9
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,240
Wake up everyone!

10
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,040
<i>I like to hang out with other vampires.</i>

11
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,090
<i>I like the company.</i>

12
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,840
Awaken!

13
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,140
A wakey, wakey!

14
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:30,140
<i>I just really like having a good time 
 with my friends.</i>

15
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,710
Deacon...

16
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,800
Hi!

17
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,740
Hey!

18
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,740
Deacon...

19
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,430
How was your night, last night?

20
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,990
I transformed into a dog and had sex.

21
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,330
Cool!

22
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,780
We're gonna have a little flat-meeting 
 in the kitchen in about 15 minutes, okay?

23
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,960
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

24
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,220
- Should I close this? 
 - Yes.

25
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,790
Vladislav?!

26
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,000
Sorry! Sorry!

27
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:03,770
What?

28
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,040
- Hey! 
 - What time is it?

29
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,740
Umm, we're going to have a flat-meeting 
 in about 10 minutes.

30
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,610
20.

31
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,990
Okay... is it...

32
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,780
So we're...

33
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,490
...in Petyr's room.

34
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,610
I'm just going to wake him up.

35
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,990
Petyr?

36
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,620
Petyr?!

37
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,490
Petyr, wake up.

38
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:05,310
Hey, listen. We're just having a flat-meeting 
 upstairs in about 10 minutes.

39
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,980
You don't have to come but I thought I'd

40
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,740
extend an invitation to you just in case.

41
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,850
Umm....

42
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,880
There's a lot of stuff on 
 the floor down here, Petyr, and...

43
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,700
... like this seems, I don't... AH!

44
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,700
It's a spinal column, yuck!

45
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,830
And I was thinking, maybe...

46
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,330
... I just should bring a broom 
 down here for you

47
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,720
if you wanted to sweep up 
 some of the skeletons.

48
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,010
I don't know.

49
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,050
You know...

50
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,220
Okay.

51
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,210
I got you this chicken.

52
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,510
Is Petyr coming?

53
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,370
- Should we be worried? 
 - Petyr's...

54
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,730
... 8000 years old.

55
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,980
We're not going to have Petyr at the meeting.

56
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,160
Okay, so...

57
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,760
Wanted to have a quick chat 
 about flat responsibilities because

58
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,220
uh...guys I think that we're 
 not all pulling our weight here.

59
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,320
We're not just pointing the finger at you, Deacon.

60
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:03,620
You're a cool guy but you're 
 not pulling your weight in the flat.

61
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,520
Well, I'm glad to hear that I'm cool.

62
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,870
- No, that's not the point though... 
 - Yeah, no, I know...

63
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,980
It's not a flat meeting about how cool you are.

64
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,960
- I do my flat chores. 
 - No, you don't!

65
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,160
- Yes, I do 
 - No, that's why we're having the flat-meeting.

66
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,940
The point is Deacon that you 
 have not done the dishes for 5 years.

67
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,900
Vladislav is right.

68
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,590
It's unacceptable to have so many 
 bloody dishes all over the bench like that...

69
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm so embarrassed when people come over here.

70
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:28,780
Why does it matter?!

71
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,280
You bring them over to kill them!

72
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,670
Vampires don't do dishes.

73
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,510
<i>Deacon's like the rebellious young vampire.</i>

74
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:40,580
<i>He's always doing crazy things. 
 Saying crazy things.</i>

75
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,010
<i>He's just like the young, bad boy of the group.</i>

76
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,150
Okay, so...

77
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,600
One day I was...

78
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,460
... selling my wears...

79
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,380
<i>And I walked passed this old creepy castle.</i>

80
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:56,360
<i>and I look at it and think...</i>

81
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,150
... 'very old and creepy.'

82
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,150
And then this creature...

83
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,560
<i>... flies at me!</i>

84
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,250
<i>It dragged me back to this dark dungeon.</i>

85
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,410
<i>And bit into my neck.</i>

86
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,210
<i>And just at the point of death...</i>

87
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,530
<i>... this creature...</i>

88
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:15,770
<i>... forced me to suck its foul blood.</i>

89
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,210
<i>And then...</i>

90
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,720
... it opened it's wings, like this.

91
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,030
And hovered above me.

92
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,560
Screeching.

93
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,440
'Now you are vampire.'

94
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,000
And it was Petyr.

95
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,020
And we're still friends today.

96
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,800
Vlad, you are great. 
 You put out the recycling.

97
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,330
Which was really cool.

98
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,090
And!

99
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,760
The other day, I dragged mans body down the hallway,

100
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,520
and noticed that there was no dust.

101
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,750
Like, I kind of... I kind of swept the hallway.

102
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,570
<i>Vladislav, is just like...</i>

103
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,540
<i>... this older vampire who</i>

104
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,540
<i>grew up in the medieval times.</i>

105
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,600
<i>And you know, to be living this long</i>

106
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,070
<i>and to have seen the things that he's seen</i>

107
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,260
<i>and still like, kind of have it together,</i>

108
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,630
<i>I mean, hat's off to him.</i>

109
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,540
Bloody hell!

110
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,210
Sorry!

111
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:14,210
<i>He's a really great guy.</i>

112
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,210
<i>A bit a of a pervert.</i>

113
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:19,740
<i>He has some pretty old ideas about things.</i>

114
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,970
We should get some slaves!

115
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,650
<i>When I first became a vampire...</i>

116
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,760
... I was quite tyrannical.

117
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,910
I was known for torturing a lot of people.

118
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,290
This is my torture chamber.

119
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,960
I don't come in here, often anymore.

120
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:45,050
I tempted to torture when 
 I was in a bad place.

121
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:48,430
<i>My thing was, I would poke someone</i>

122
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,260
<i>with implements.</i>

123
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:53,290
I was known as 'Vladislav the poker'.

124
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,300
It's been like this the whole time...

125
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:00,080
- Okay, so... 
<i> - Viago is a little...</i>

126
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,500
<i>... pedantic.</i>

127
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,760
The washing and the rubbish, I did that.

128
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,730
Deacon, on dishes and 
 it's still hasn't moved in 5 years.

129
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,680
<i>He was an 18th century dandy.</i>

130
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,130
<i>So, he can be very fussy.</i>

131
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,710
He nags and nags...

132
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:20,330
The lunch the other day and 
 it was blood all over my nice antique couch.

133
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,130
Which one, the red one?

134
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,000
Well, it's red now, yah.

135
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,890
If you're going to eat a victim 
 on my nice clean couch

136
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,020
put down some newspaper on the floor

137
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,920
and some towels. 
 It's not hard to do.

138
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,620
We're vampires! 
 We don't put down towels.

139
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,620
Some vampires do.

140
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,700
Well, not serious ones!

141
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,900
<i>When you get 4 vampires in a flat</i>

142
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:44,400
<i>obviously there's going to be a lot of tension.</i>

143
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,950
There's tension in any, any flatting situation.

144
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,790
It's settled then. We all do our jobs, 
 starting with a certain Deacon...

145
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,640
I will do my dishes!

146
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,020
This is bullshit.

147
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,300
Well, I became a vampire when I was 16.

148
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,280
That is why I always look 16.

149
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,920
In those days, of course, 
 life was tough for a 16 year old.

150
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,140
<i>Vampires have had a pretty bad rec.</i>

151
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:24,820
We're not these mopey 
 old creatures who live in castles.

152
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:28,060
And while some, most of us are, a lot are... bats.

153
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:31,310
There are also, those of us, 
 who like to flat together in

154
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,280
really small countries like New Zealand.

155
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:46,240
I was a Nazi vampire.

156
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,820
<i>After the war, which the Nazi's lost...</i>

157
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,480
I don't know, 
 if you know that the Nazi's lost...

158
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,580
... that war.

159
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,800
If you were a Nazi, after the war...

160
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,040
...and if you were a vampire...

161
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,260
... and if you were a Nazi vampire...

162
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,990
No way.

163
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,610
<i>I was out of there.</i>

164
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,830
Yah, I came to this country for love.

165
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,300
Uh, there was a girl. Human girl.

166
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,840
And...

167
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:07,980
... I...

168
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,420
... thought she was fantastic. 
 She was...

169
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,290
... absolutely amazing.

170
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,610
<i>I was smitten.</i>

171
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:17,430
<i>Her family emigrated to New Zealand.</i>

172
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,500
And, I thought,

173
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,220
'you know what, to hell with it.

174
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,750
I'm gonna go. I'm going to chase her 
 and tell her how I feel.'

175
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,750
I told my servant Phillip,

176
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,910
<i>'Send me to New Zealand.'</i>

177
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,740
<i>He...</i>

178
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,480
<i>... put the wrong postage on my coffin.</i>

179
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,730
<i>So the whole journey took about 18 months.</i>

180
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,630
And when I got here, she had...

181
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,810
... found someone else.

182
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,180
She had fallen in love.

183
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,250
And...

184
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,310
She was married.

185
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,610
She gave me this before she left.

186
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,050
There she is.

187
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,120
That's me, I put myself in there too.

188
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,210
She told me in was pure silver.

189
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,530
Unfortunately...

190
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,240
... we vampires can not wear silver.

191
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:41,800
Yeah...

192
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,000
It's about as long as I can wear that.

193
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,050
<i>Tonight, we are going out 
 into Wellington center.</i>

194
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,070
<i>It is important that we look good.</i>

195
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,510
Yeah, it's really good. Yeah.

196
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:23,610
One of the unfortunate things about 
 not having a reflection is that you...

197
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,940
... don't know exactly what you look like.

198
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,760
Look!

199
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,870
A ghost cup!

200
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:34,050
Floating all by itself!

201
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,550
<i>We can give each other feedback and</i>

202
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,300
<i>help each other out until 
 we're looking great.</i>

203
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,830
<i>Yes, some of our clothes are from victims.</i>

204
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,930
We might bite someone and then...

205
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,740
... you think, 
 'ooh, those are some nice pants!'.

206
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,040
- Do work these? 
 - NO!

207
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:48,780
Change it!

208
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,740
When you are a vampire, 
 you become very sexy.

209
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:58,590
We are trying to attract victims to us.

210
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,110
Not sure about the waist coat.

211
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,510
I go for a look which I call 
 Dead But Delicious.

212
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,610
We are the bait.

213
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,610
<i>But we're also the trap.</i>

214
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,450
Hello, ladies.

215
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,600
And my love, we are ready to go 
 into town and party!

216
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,600
Vampire... vampire style.

217
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,160
<i>When we go into town, 
 we must try to blend in.</i>

218
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,590
We are walking the streets.

219
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:53,230
Coming into town. 
 Um, it's really cool because

220
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,890
just for one brief moment

221
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:55,480
I feel...

222
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,580
Homos!

223
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,320
The trouble with being a vampire is you

224
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,640
have to be invited in, to go in.

225
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,340
We would like to come into the bar, please.

226
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,340
Invite us into the bar, please.

227
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,340
Keep walking.

228
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,070
You invite us in!

229
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,360
If the humans find out what we were...

230
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,680
... they would destroy us.

231
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:26,150
<i>There are between 60 and 70 vampires 
 in the greater Wellington region.</i>

232
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,040
- Obvious vampire. 
 - Joline!

233
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,720
Hello!

234
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,260
How embarrassing.

235
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,080
He's a guy I used to work with 
 when I was human.

236
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,700
- Is he gone? 
 - Yeah, he's gone.

237
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,270
I've been draining him all night.

238
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,270
Been a very thirsty girl.

239
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,760
<i>Being bitten as a little boy or a little girl</i>

240
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,540
you always going to look the same age.

241
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,650
What are you doing tonight?

242
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,200
Going to kill some perverts?

243
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,360
- Yeah, we're meeting a pedophile. 
 - Cool.

244
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,000
Okay, let's just go please.

245
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,920
- Have a good night, guys! 
 - Yeah, you have a good night!

246
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,400
The Big Kumara is vampire owned and operated, 
 so we could always get in.

247
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,030
It's the hottest night spot 
 for vampires in Wellington.

248
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,820
- Come on in, guys, come on in. 
 - Thank you.

249
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,030
Perhaps you could bring 
 some people to the house.

250
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,410
- Sure. 
 - Perhaps some virgins?

251
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,890
Virgins? Yep, okay.

252
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,710
Any kind of preference in terms of gender or?

253
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,180
Maybe some ladies?

254
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,400
Yep. Ladies.

255
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,360
Perhaps a guy?

256
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,860
One of each?

257
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,360
One of each should be cool.

258
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,250
<i>My relationship with Deacon is...</i>

259
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,690
... well, I'm his familiar. 
 He's my Master.

260
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,160
<i>He tells me what to do, I do it.</i>

261
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:42,330
<i>We have the kind of master-servant 
 relationship which works nicely.</i>

262
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,050
<i>Actually.</i>

263
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:43,840
- Hello! 
 - Hello.

264
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,110
Oh, it's a little bit of blood.

265
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,940
Um, my husband, he's a, 
 he's a hemophiliac.

266
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,060
You know, someone who bleeds a lot.

267
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:50,630
Yeah.

268
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,440
Any kind of age range?

269
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,090
- Young. 
 - But not, not kids?

270
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,400
Not kids.

271
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,080
18 to 30?

272
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,630
Definitely younger than yourself.

273
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,630
Okay, so 18 to 30.

274
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:03,770
So it's a dinner party?

275
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:04,910
- I'll be there? 
 - Yes!

276
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,270
- Dinner party.  
 - The guys we'll be there?

277
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:06,740
Yes.

278
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,020
- We will all be there? 
 - Yes, we will dress up.

279
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,640
- Okay, great. 
 - And then... eat them.

280
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,940
- Should be fun. 
 - Okay, great.

281
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,110
I was just wondering 
 if we could talk about the...

282
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,570
You don't know of a night dentist?

283
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,250
Because I have this thing here.

284
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:22,200
I was just wondering if 
 we could talk about the deal.

285
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,530
- Hm? 
 - The deal.

286
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,820
- The dishes? 
 - No, the...

287
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:31,440
The deal is that he is going 
 to give me eternal life.

288
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,500
Um, which is...

289
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,010
... very exciting.

290
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,100
Well, I just feel like I kind of 
 reached my potential and

291
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,480
I wouldn't want to kind of, 
 get any older before, I kind of...

292
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,060
I just feel like I'm the best version 
 of myself that I can be.

293
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,100
It's just that it's been 
 4 and a half years and I just

294
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,100
I just want... doing your plans and...

295
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,380
Doing your dry-cleaning. 
 Now I'm doing your dishes.

296
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,880
Yeah... the dentist?

297
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:53,940
And the dentist and it's just taking 
 an awful long time, so I was just wondering...

298
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,940
- Be gone! 
 - Okay.

299
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,500
- I see you later! 
 - Okay.

300
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:13,300
<i>One of the most unfortunate things 
 about being a vampire is that...</i>

301
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,940
<i>... you have to drink human blood.</i>

302
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,940
<i>I like to make a real evening of it.</i>

303
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,550
<i>Play some music.</i>

304
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:24,140
<i>Maybe give them some nice wine.</i>

305
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,330
<i>It's their last moment alive so 
 why not make it a nice experience.</i>

306
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:31,920
So...

307
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,100
Tell we what you do, what do you...

308
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,680
I was thinking about 
 going back to Uni, actually.

309
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,210
Oh, you are? 
 Lets put this over

310
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,400
there.

311
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,420
University, yeah?

312
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:45,160
Yeah, but after that, 
 I'm gonna travel.

313
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,130
Yeah...

314
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:49,130
I really wanted 
 to go over seas for ages, so..

315
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,840
Saving out and I'm gonna go to Spain and

316
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,180
Italy and London and...

317
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,440
Yeah.

318
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,910
Okay. Excuse me.

319
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,910
Just put that there.

320
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,850
There we go.

321
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,130
Shit!

322
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:28,020
Well, that didn't go so great.

323
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,280
Um, I hit the main artery.

324
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:35,760
So, yeah, it's a real mess in there, um...

325
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,670
On the upside, 
 I think she had a really good time.

326
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,740
So, it's quite late and uh...

327
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:03,500
I've managed to find a woman up, 
 watching television.

328
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,900
And, uh, she seems like 
 she'd be a good victim.

329
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:11,090
I'm just going to use hypnosis on her...

330
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,280
See me...

331
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,140
See me...

332
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,950
She can't, she can't see me 
 from that angle.

333
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,860
<i>Vladislav used to be extremely powerful.</i>

334
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,320
<i>He could hypnotize crowds of people.</i>

335
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,280
<i>Great orgies. 20-30 women.</i>

336
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,560
<i>He could turn into all sorts of animals.</i>

337
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,740
<i>But now he never get the faces right.</i>

338
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,480
<i>He would kill anybody. 
 Men, women.</i>

339
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,820
Children. Burning... everything.

340
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,960
It was totally great.

341
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:47,600
But he suffered a humiliating defeat...

342
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,320
... at the hands of his arch nemesis...

343
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,320
... The Beast.

344
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,360
And, he's never been the same.

345
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,040
See me...

346
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:08,000
See me...

347
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,610
See me...

348
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,560
See me...

349
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:19,480
Would you like to come inside?

350
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,940
Ah!

351
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:46,220
- Jackie, welcome! Come in. 
 - Hello.

352
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:49,550
This is Nick. Ex-ex boyfriend.

353
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,130
- And Josefine. 
 - Nice house.

354
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:53,940
And this is Deacon, 
 my over seas friend from Europe.

355
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,730
Deacon and his friends need...

356
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,790
... victims.

357
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:00,640
Hi! Please come in, welcome.

358
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,640
There can't be people that...

359
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,110
... I actually

360
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:08,630
envious them or like because of course 
 they will become victims.

361
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,710
Hi! Josefine?

362
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:13,120
No, I sat next to you in English. 
 Remember?

363
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,040
Um, you used to call me the Jacksersist?

364
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,310
No you did, no you did. Yeah.

365
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:20,040
No, you started that.

366
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:23,880
You were the one who started calling me that and 
 then it kind of caught on.

367
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,060
Yeah.

368
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,800
Okay, bye then. Bye.

369
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:28,800
She's in.

370
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,820
You like that, Nick?

371
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,840
Yep, it's nice.

372
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,740
I will go and prepare dinner.

373
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,990
Nick, are you a virgin at all?

374
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,260
Um, what?

375
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,400
Doesn't seem like... are, are you a virgin?

376
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,640
- Yes. 
 - Um, no.

377
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,010
You were a virgin when 
 we were seeing each other?

378
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,240
Yeah, I was 12.

379
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,880
You said he was a virgin.

380
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,540
I think we drink virgin blood because...

381
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,040
... it sounds cool.

382
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,720
<i>I think of it like this...</i>

383
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:07,280
If you're going to eat a sandwich..

384
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,400
You will just enjoy it more if 
 you knew no one had fucked it.

385
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,050
Let's concentrate on Josefine than.

386
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,670
Are you a virgin?

387
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,980
I'm not, no.

388
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,600
Okay, I'm really sorry.

389
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:20,120
Because I totally...

390
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,580
Him there is a Virgin.

391
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,630
She looks like a virgin. 
 She talks like a virgin, I mean...

392
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:27,290
Who would have sex with her, I wouldn't.

393
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,960
I would.

394
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,840
Oh.

395
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,020
Okay, good.

396
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,870
- It's 2 dinners... yum. 
 - Nick.

397
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,020
Do you like bisghetti?

398
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,190
Uh... yep. 
 I usually like it.

399
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:43,580
But, be better if it was warm?

400
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,300
<i>So, this is my favorite trick.</i>

401
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:48,900
We present our guest with a plate of bisghetti.

402
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:52,880
And then, I would say, 
 ' Why don't you eat some bisghetti?'

403
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,640
Please, Nick.

404
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,170
Eat some bisghetti.

405
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:01,100
I didn't realize you enjoy eating worms.

406
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:01,970
Nick.

407
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,580
- No... 
 - They are worms.

408
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,400
There's worms moving around on my plate.

409
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:07,410
Worm like but not actually...
There's worms moving around on my plate.

410
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:09,370
Worm like but not actually...

411
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:12,240
<i>We stole that idea from The Lost Boys.</i>

412
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:14,160
But I put a nice twist on it.

413
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,150
Nick.

414
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,540
How does it feel to 
 have a snake for a penis?

415
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,110
Jackie?

416
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,000
My penis has disappeared. 
 It's a cobra snake.

417
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,910
Nobody is gonna mistake 
 your penis for a cobra, Nick, okay?

418
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,300
- Believe me. 
 - What have you put in my bisghetti?

419
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,070
No, it is just a normal penis.

420
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,370
I'm out. I'm out.

421
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,240
Josefine?

422
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,240
Do you like bisghetti?

423
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,680
Look, these freaks...

424
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:43,410
... spike my bisghetti, 
 make my cock turn into a snake is not cool.

425
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,210
Not cool.

426
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,640
You don't think this is weird?

427
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,560
For fuck sakes...

428
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,160
Jackie?!

429
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,180
Jackie!

430
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,600
- Sorry Nick. 
 - What are you doing?!

431
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,760
Jackie!

432
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:16,480
Shit!

433
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,180
Fuck off.

434
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,980
Where am I?

435
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,450
Fuck.

436
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,240
Fuck!

437
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:29,760
Freaks!

438
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,250
Ah, no...

439
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,180
Petyr got him.

440
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,810
Poor guy...

441
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,910
Who let Petyr out?

442
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:47,370
Hey, guys!

443
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,170
Hey, what are you guys doing?

444
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,320
What are you doing, Nick?

445
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,960
Come into the house.

446
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,880
<i>- Hi, my name is Nick. </i>
 - Hey, guys.

447
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,620
<i>I've been a vampire for 2 months.</i>

448
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:03,990
<i>Probably, I reckon best thing 
 about being a vampire is flying.</i>

449
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,560
Like I've always wanted to, 
 I think everyone has always wanted to fly.

450
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,300
And now I can do it.

451
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,770
Oh...

452
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:21,230
Nick, why don't you use the front door?

453
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,750
Why would I? I'm flying.

454
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,620
<i>Petyr bit me.</i>

455
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:26,920
<i>Sucked all my blood out.</i>

456
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,710
<i>I woke up in his basement and...</i>

457
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,150
<i>... he offered me some blood.</i>

458
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,760
I just thought it was something...

459
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,760
... some German thing that these guys do.

460
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:36,970
<i>This transition, into becoming 
 a vampire was pretty hard.</i>

461
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,600
<i>I look like shit to start off with, like, 
 I had a massive gash on my neck.</i>

462
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,540
<i>Like you could see the inside of my neck.</i>

463
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,290
<i>I had blood all over my top.</i>

464
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,160
<i>And then I came home and 
 I was sweating.</i>

465
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,880
<i>I was either really hot or really cold.</i>

466
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:52,040
<i>It was like a hang-over times 10, I reckon.</i>

467
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,440
<i>It was really bad.</i>

468
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,620
<i>It was quite similar to having the flu.</i>

469
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,030
<i>Except, the only difference 
 would probably be...</i>

470
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,250
<i>... that my eyes bleed heaps.</i>

471
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,560
Are you guys not cold?

472
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:13,470
<i>No, I can't really explain it. 
 It's like, yeah, really hot and cold and like...</i>

473
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,730
<i>... bloody eyes and flying and stuff.</i>

474
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,540
The neighbors can see you 
 flying around the house.

475
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,620
You want to draw attention 
 to his house, hm?

476
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,880
You got a whole... 
 documentary crew following you around.

477
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,040
I am doing an erotic dance for my friends.

478
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:27,170
And you ruined it. 
 I was in the zone.

479
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:28,560
My friends are loving it.

480
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:30,360
I love it. I saw the end of it. 
 It looked great.

481
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,320
<i>I don't, I don't know, 
 if I'm, if I'm accepted yet.</i>

482
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,570
<i>But... I don't know. 
 I think it's getting there.</i>

483
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,910
I don't know the oldest stuff, 
 but they're quite naive...

484
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,390
... when it comes to the real world.

485
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,080
So...

486
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,820
I don't know, 
 it would be cool to just...

487
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,530
Hang out with them. 
 They could teach me some stuff.

488
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:46,660
But I could probably 
 teach them a few things.

489
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:56,130
<i>At the start it was like, 'Oh no, like I'm..'</i>

490
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:57,600
<i>'... I'm dead.'</i>

491
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,860
<i>It kind of affected my friendship with normal people, 
 my family and stuff.</i>

492
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:04,530
<i>But, of the way I see it, 
 I've got a whole new family.</i>

493
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:08,550
<i>They accept me for who I am. 
 They don't even seem to know who they are.</i>

494
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,340
<i>Even though...</i>

495
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,720
<i>... one of them killed me.</i>

496
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,600
Where should we go tonight?

497
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:14,820
Let's go to the big Kumara.

498
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,580
Why don't we go to Boogie Wonderland? 
  We never get in to Boogie Wonderland.

499
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:20,040
My friend Richard's the bouncer. 
 He can get us in.

500
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,040
- What? Really? 
 - I'll invite us in.

501
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,710
- Stu is game. 
 - He will come with us too?

502
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:27,000
Ah, this is my friend Stu.

503
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,460
- Hey. 
 - He works in computers and stuff.

504
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,480
Originally he went out with my sister.

505
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,980
And then they broke up.

506
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,660
I didn't want her to do it, but...

507
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,860
It's got nothing to do with me.

508
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:38,260
And um... he can't hear me.

509
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:41,690
Yeah, so basically...

510
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,880
Stu doesn't know that I'm a vampire.

511
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,180
And he doesn't know that 
 my friends are vampires.

512
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,570
<i>He just thinks that I'm just...</i>

513
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,520
<i>... with some powerful friends.</i>

514
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:54,220
<i>I bought a room in the house and 
 he thought I bought a meal.</i>

515
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,690
Just like...

516
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,480
... it really, really sucks...

517
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,300
... that I can't eat him.

518
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:01,810
I just want to like...

519
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,580
Look at it. 
 He's the reddest guy I know.

520
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,580
Right, you can hear me.

521
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:11,320
- Like computer based and stuff, heh, mainly? 
 - Yeah, yeah.

522
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,250
- Databases. 
 - Yeah, like computers mainly.

523
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:18,920
Let's have a vote for Boogie Wonderland 
 or The Big Kumara.

524
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,690
Big Kumara!

525
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:23,980
Wait.

526
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,350
Come on Stu, hurry up.

527
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,540
<i>I don't think Nick should have been 
 turned into a vampire.</i>

528
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,320
He's such a dick.

529
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,560
Looking great man!

530
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:37,780
You are most welcome!

531
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,380
We're in Boogie Wonderland!

532
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:54,370
Here we are at Boogie Wonderland 
 and it is so much fun.

533
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,660
This is amazing!

534
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,520
I'm so happy to be here.

535
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:02,240
This is pretty cheesy.

536
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,440
Also, did you see the jacket he wore?

537
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,030
He's wearing the same jacket as me.

538
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,430
- It's not exactly the same. 
 - It's pretty close.

539
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:18,400
I'm just loving being a vampire.

540
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:26,240
Over there, is the big Fat Lady's Arms.

541
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,260
Ah, on Wednesday's there be, 
 like fear factor competition.

542
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,620
You can win like t-shirts and 
 hats and small prizes.

543
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,620
I can smell werewolves.

544
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:38,800
Okay, we're just about to walk passed some werewolves 
 so some shit might go down!

545
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:41,220
Look out guys. Don't catch flees.

546
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,670
- What's that, mate? 
 - Deacon.

547
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,440
- Sorry what? 
 - Keep going, keep walking.

548
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,500
- Keep walking! 
 - We heard that, mate. We've got sensitive hearing.

549
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,590
- Have you? 
 - Yeah.

550
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,290
What are you filming? 
 It's a music video, is it?

551
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:51,080
We don't want any trouble.

552
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,880
- Why did you start it? 
 - Well, I do. Have I got your heckles up?

553
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,400
Huh?

554
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,960
Why don't you girls smell 
 your own crutches, huh?

555
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,250
- Come on. It's not worth it. 
 - What are you talking about?

556
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:01,250
We don't smell our own crutches. 
 We smell each others crutches.

557
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,250
And it's a... form of... greeting.

558
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,970
Your own camera, mate, don't, don't...

559
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:05,380
What?

560
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:07,110
It's okay, cause I know this guy.

561
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,320
It's count Fagula.

562
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,430
Hey, hey, hey! Don't swear.

563
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:13,330
- Sorry... they... they... 
 - We're werewolves.

564
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:14,340
- Not swearwolves. 
 - What are we?

565
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,260
We're werewolves, not swearwolves.

566
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:19,820
- No, listen, that's offensive... 
 - That's a really offensive word to call people.

567
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:22,150
Well, at least you're talking 
 about a bundle of sticks.

568
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,820
Please, this bundle of sticks...

569
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:24,900
Werewolves?

570
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,490
- No, no, no! 
 - Don't get it! Nathan it's not real.

571
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:29,350
He's just gonna take of his gloves.

572
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:31,580
Ah, shit, man! 
 Why the fuck did you do that for?

573
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:34,800
Hey! Don't swear. 
 We're gonna lose it. We're gonna lose it.

574
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,620
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
 - Hey.

575
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,790
Calm down. Calm down!

576
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,190
- Get the fuck my glasses! 
 - Dion! Dion!

577
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,090
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

578
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:45,740
Do the breathing! Do the breathing.

579
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,860
Do the breathing. 
 Count to 10, mate. Count to 10.

580
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,200
- Come on. 
 - Hold it.

581
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,200
Count to 10, human again.

582
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,880
- 10, human again. 
 - It's alright. It's not full moon.

583
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:53,950
Thanks a lot guys.

584
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,290
- Enjoy your night, yah? 
 - You should be ashamed of yourselves, man.

585
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,780
Great, we didn't want this to happen.

586
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,010
- Come on guys. 
 - Hey!

587
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:08,010
Say it! Don't spray it, bitch!

588
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:08,950
Declan!

589
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:11,710
- Why are you swearing all the time?! 
 - Well, he ride with me...

590
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,710
- Were they actually werewolves? 
 - Yeah.

591
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,710
Are you okay, Stu?

592
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,920
<i>I just don't really know how to...</i>

593
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,050
<i>... approach this, 
 cause I never done it before.</i>

594
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,640
Um, and he is a good friend.

595
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:26,140
And I don't wanna...

596
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,550
... I don't want to break that friendship but..

597
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,160
... then again, what do you do when 
 someone tells you, that they're a vampire?

598
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,170
<i>I'm expecting him to be angry.</i>

599
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:38,830
<i>He might be scared and expecting 
 lot of things to, to bubble to the surface.</i>

600
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,170
You probably noticed, it has been...

601
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,850
... I've been going through a few changes lately.

602
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:46,770
- Yeah. 
 - Yeah?

603
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:47,470
Yeah.

604
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:48,860
Like...

605
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,030
I don't show up for lunch anymore.

606
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,420
- Yeah. 
 - Have...

607
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,140
... changed the story of all of Tina's games.

608
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,620
The night time, Tina's games.

609
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,470
Right...

610
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,480
And how you went from beating me

611
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,480
every time and how I

612
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,480
I've won the last 3?

613
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,620
Yeah.

614
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,730
So...

615
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,430
The reason I brought you here...

616
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,160
... is to tell you that...

617
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,710
... I'm a vampire.

618
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:19,740
<i>Stu took it pretty well.</i>

619
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,740
<i>He's definitely my best mate.</i>

620
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,160
<i>And I'm not gonna eat him.</i>

621
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,960
But if they ever offer you bisghetti...

622
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:27,180
Um.... you shouldn't eat it.

623
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,680
They offered me biscotti.

624
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,320
Vampire mates don't eat human mates.

625
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:35,430
And no matter how much I want to eat him...

626
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:37,320
... I will never eat him cause he's my mate.

627
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,340
- Right, Stu? 
 - Yah.

628
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,710
Yeah.

629
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,480
<i>Stu is great.</i>

630
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:48,030
We really like him.

631
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,660
At first I wanted to kill him.

632
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:54,180
But now I'm glad I've spent 
 the time to get to know him.

633
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:58,220
<i>Yeah, of course he looks delicious 
 with his big red cheeks.</i>

634
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:02,380
But we've all got an agreement 
 that we're not going to eat Stu.

635
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,940
- Right? 
 - Right.

636
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,660
The guys upstairs, they... 
 They're loving him.

637
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:10,360
That's ... it started off with, 
 'Who's this human you're bringing into the house?'

638
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:12,380
But it took them literally 2 minutes and

639
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,380
they like him more than 
 they like me, I reckon.

640
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:17,270
I'm knitting a scarf for Stu.

641
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,060
Try it again. Use your legs.

642
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:22,750
Wow.

643
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:26,240
- Step back... 
 - Punching high.

644
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,020
- Yep. 
 - Hi.

645
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:28,680
Yep.

646
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,160
I'm just, what I'm trying to say is...

647
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,110
... cause I know that you...

648
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,610
... you turned me into a vampire.

649
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,870
Maybe don't do that to him.

650
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,830
He's a... vegetarian.

651
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,880
Last thing he'd want to is eat...

652
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,640
... a life-being or eat blood or eat meat...

653
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,380
- I am controlling this. 
 - Get it, get it!

654
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:49,690
<i>Quite amazing to see how far 
 technology can go forward</i>

655
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,740
<i>if you're not paying attention.</i>

656
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,160
One message received.

657
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,160
There is a crucifix behind you.

658
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,890
So, done on it, or like, 
 half way down and focus it.

659
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:05,850
Maybe smile.

660
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:13,380
- Anything you want to find, you... 
 - Yeah.

661
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:15,780
- You can type your name here. 
 - I've lost...

662
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:20,250
... a really nice silk scarf in about 1912.

663
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,380
Yes, now Google it.

664
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:26,010
<i>Stu is the first human friend 
 that I've had for long time.</i>

665
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,080
With humans there's a tendency to die.

666
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,400
Yeah.

667
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,100
We can look at her photos.

668
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,260
- Ah, oh yes. 
 - Or you can poke her.

669
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:38,830
Yes.

670
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,660
Can we see a movie with sunrise?

671
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,930
- What? Shit! 
 - Whoo...

672
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,490
Nice...

673
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:49,920
If you push images, 
 than we can see pictures of virgins.

674
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,920
- Ah, yes. Yes. 
 - Yah, yah...

675
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:58,280
I don't think she's a virgin if she's doing that.

676
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,000
There he is, yeah.

677
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,430
This is my old servant, Phillip.

678
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,780
- So, we're gonna call him. 
 - Yeah.

679
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:19,200
And...

680
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:21,070
...screen...

681
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:28,090
My God, that's him, that's him, 
 that's him, that's Phillip, that's Phillip.

682
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:30,090
- He looks old.

683
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,600
Yeah, kind of like youth romance, 
 but like more, more layers.

684
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,960
Maybe Twilight, have you seen it?

685
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:14,640
Okay, I'm the main guy in Twilight. 
 You now the main guy?

686
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,720
Twilight?

687
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:16,980
That's me.

688
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,350
Cameras following me around.

689
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,550
They could have chosen anyone.

690
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:21,810
How many people have you told 
 you are a vampire?

691
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,000
- Not many. 
 - I heard that girl...

692
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:26,950
... talking about that 
 you said you were a vampire.

693
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:27,960
Yeah, I told her.

694
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,480
- Who else? 
 - Who did you tell?

695
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,060
Uh, I told her hot friend.

696
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:34,080
You can't tell everyone that you're a vampire.

697
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:34,960
Who's that guy?

698
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,960
I don't know but I told him.

699
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,450
You can't tell everyone.

700
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:46,410
Yeah, I've got a bit of an eye condition.

701
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:47,800
What's wrong with him?

702
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,120
Um, vampire eyes. 
  Can't go into the sun.

703
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,840
Oh, my God, is that your fangs?

704
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:54,220
For real?

705
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,470
For real, real.

706
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,000
For real, real.

707
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,450
I'm a vampire.

708
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,680
- What?
 - Yeah.

709
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:02,790
- I'm a vampire hunter. 
 - No, you're not.

710
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,670
- No? 
 - You fucking piece of shit.

711
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:06,140
I'll Skype you!

712
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,100
I float.

713
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,640
- I transform into stuff. 
 - Same.

714
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,090
- No you can't. 
 - Yeah.

715
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:12,790
I'll show you.

716
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,310
Show me. 
 Show me some of your vampire stuff.

717
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:16,430
What have I got? 
 Um...

718
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,260
Don't lie about transforming into shit.

719
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:33,440
- Twilight! 
 - Shut up, Nick!

720
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,610
You're not Twilight.

721
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:37,730
- What's your problem? 
 - You are my problem.

722
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:39,940
Telling the world that we are vampires.

723
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,700
And I'll tell the whole world 
 that you're an asshole now.

724
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,800
Shut up!

725
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:44,760
- Shut up! 
 - Guys?

726
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,870
- You shut up! 
 - No, you shut up!

727
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:47,350
- No, you shut up. 
 - You shut up.

728
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,560
I'm Dracula, man!

729
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,880
You're not Dracula! 
 - I'm Dracula!

730
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,420
You don't even know who Dracula is!

731
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,360
You idiot!

732
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,010
- Oh, bat fight! 
 - Bat fight! Oh, yah, yah, yah!

733
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,070
Ah, Deacon!

734
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,460
That wasn't fair, man!

735
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,920
My fucking jacket, man!

736
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,920
I don't care about your stupid jacket.

737
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:18,790
- Deacon! 
 - You okay, man?

738
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:37,330
- Hey, Stu? 
 - Mm-hm?

739
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:40,280
How's your worms?

740
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,790
Alright.

741
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,750
You're eating worms.

742
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:51,280
Can you do that shit when 
 you turn them into worms?

743
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,270
No.

744
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:53,510
Doesn't work on chips.

745
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:56,370
Only works on things that 
 already look like worms.

746
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:59,960
- Maybe noodles. Do you want some noodles? 
 - He knows now.

747
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:03,380
Oh no. I wouldn't eat that.

748
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,210
Why?

749
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,310
Are you okay Nick?

750
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,160
Alright?

751
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,730
He ate fried chip.

752
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,820
I can't eat salads now, great.

753
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:33,320
I can't sunbath.

754
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:34,940
I can't watch daytime TV.

755
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:37,010
I can if I could, or I guess I could.

756
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:39,180
More, more then ever just the chips.

757
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,100
My favorite food. 
  I can't eat chips.

758
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:43,860
I don't... it's just...

759
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:44,820
I hate...

760
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:46,990
I said it. I'm over being a vampire. 
 It's shit.

761
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:49,280
So, don't, don't believe the hype.

762
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,320
Jackie?!

763
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,560
Jackie, can I come in please?

764
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:13,760
- Okay, off to bed, guys! 
 - Hello, children!

765
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:16,440
- Don't look at the men. 
 - You want me to kill this?

766
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,440
Don't look at the men!

767
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,910
I was going to bite you tonight.

768
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:21,800
Really?

769
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:25,000
But now I can't because 
 there's this Nick being a vampire.

770
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,190
Sorry, sorry, I thought you 
 killed him 2 months ago.

771
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:29,190
No, I didn't...no... he's a vampire.

772
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:30,100
What do you mean?

773
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,020
He jumped in front of your place.

774
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,530
All I'm saying is that, um...

775
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:37,960
You know if I had a penis, 
 I would have been...

776
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,660
I would have been bitten years ago.

777
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,510
I might have to penalize you.

778
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:45,740
Perhaps another couple of years.  
 Maybe 10 years.

779
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:46,440
Hm?

780
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,150
Like one big circle, just biting each others dicks.

781
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,820
You know, they don't even wear shirts, 
 they wear blouses. It's, it's just...

782
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:54,540
... a big homo-erotic dick biting club.

783
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:57,880
And I'm stuck here, 
 ironing their fucking frills.

784
00:45:58,060 --> 00:45:59,640
Also clean the bathroom, please.

785
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:02,000
It's blood everywhere. 
 It is gruesome.

786
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,780
Okay, see you tomorrow.

787
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:10,840
Off to bed, please.

788
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:25,620
<i>Katherine.</i>

789
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,560
<i>She was so charming and nice.</i>

790
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,560
<i>She was everything I wanted.</i>

791
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:32,480
<i>Unfortunately...</i>

792
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,480
<i>... yeah, she was married.</i>

793
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,000
<i>Sure, I wanted to kill the guy.</i>

794
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,320
<i>I thought about, chopping his head off.</i>

795
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:42,900
<i>Draining him of every 
 drop of blood that he had.</i>

796
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:44,260
<i>Who wouldn't?</i>

797
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:48,830
<i>But then, I also saw 
 how happy she was.</i>

798
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,400
<i>And that made me kind of happy.</i>

799
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:55,950
<i>And I didn't want to ruin it for her, so...</i>

800
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:59,150
<i>I did the honorable thing and I just...</i>

801
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:00,730
<i>... stepped back.</i>

802
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:03,000
<i>And let her live her life.</i>

803
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:29,590
Petyr!

804
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:31,200
Petyr!

805
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,160
Where is it?

806
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:33,280
Petyr!

807
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,360
Petyr!

808
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,380
Petyr!

809
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:38,950
Get water!

810
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:42,160
- Get out of the sunlight! 
 - Get water! Get water!

811
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,490
Get water! Petyr, get away from the sunlight!

812
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:46,490
Get in the shadows, Petyr!

813
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,030
Get out of the sunlight!

814
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:50,880
Get out of my way!

815
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,000
I'm going in!

816
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,070
I'm coming Petyr!

817
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:56,110
- Deacon, no, it's sunlight! 
 - I'm coming for you!

818
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:58,220
It's sunlight out there!

819
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:01,470
It's sunlight!

820
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,630
I was too late.

821
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:19,270
Turn that thing off.

822
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:23,300
Our friend had just been killed 
 in a fatal sunlight accident.

823
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,270
So this is what I think happened.

824
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,530
The vampire hunter...

825
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:44,620
... broke into the window here.

826
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:49,090
Has impacted the table. Breaking the table leg.

827
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:51,400
Then he has come this way.

828
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:53,970
Towards the tomb.

829
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:55,970
Crucifix!

830
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,810
Cover the crucifix!

831
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:01,750
And then...

832
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:04,470
... Petyr has burst from the tomb.

833
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,640
Pushed the tomb lid 
 on to the vampire hunter.

834
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:10,690
And then the sunlight has come through here.

835
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:12,500
And burned Petyr alive.

836
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,460
Think this is just a table leg, which is...

837
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:16,680
... sanded down.

838
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,680
- Do you think he hand sanded that, or? 
 - Yes.

839
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,210
Image that, stuck in your...

840
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:23,820
It's quite shocking down here, Nick.

841
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:26,900
Look, here's our sweet Petyr.

842
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:28,900
- Fucking hell. 
 - Burnt to a sizzle.

843
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,920
- I can't figure out this. 
 - This is the vampire hunter.

844
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:32,450
Is this Franco?

845
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:33,990
- Uh, who's this guy? 
 - Look at this...

846
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:36,130
... bloody head, back to front.

847
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:38,130
Twist it the other way, 
 the other way!

848
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,880
Let's see who this guy is.

849
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:44,720
- Hm, typical macho type. 
 - Yuck!

850
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,660
It is.

851
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,220
Oh, shit!

852
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,210
I know that guy.

853
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:51,140
- Actually. 
 - You know him?

854
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:52,620
- Yeah. 
 - What?

855
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,360
I saw him the other night in town.

856
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:56,330
Told him I was a vampire.

857
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:56,810
What?!

858
00:49:56,810 --> 00:49:59,050
I thought he was joking. 
 He said he was a vampire hunter.

859
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:01,380
You let a vampire hunter into our house?

860
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,380
- I just gave him my e-mail. 
 - Nick!

861
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,190
Take out your tongue.

862
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:07,760
And shove it down your ass.

863
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:11,490
Fucking hell!

864
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,990
You and your big mouth!

865
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,600
It was a mistake!

866
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,180
Get up and stand on this ceiling like a man.

867
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:41,470
We can talk it out, yeah, man?

868
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:42,350
We can talk it out, mate!

869
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:44,640
- I'll kill you! 
 - I'm already dead!

870
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:46,770
Stu, stay back!

871
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:52,140
Someone's at the door.

872
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:55,450
Go, go.

873
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,000
Oh, shit.

874
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:07,000
- Good evening, sir. 
 - Hello, police.

875
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,520
Hi, I'm constable O'Leary. 
 This is constable Minogue.

876
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:13,140
We're just responding to a report 
 of a possible forced entry and also...

877
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:15,060
... a rather large amount of shrieking.

878
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:17,560
Just, um, wondering maybe we could come in 
 and just have a wee look around?

879
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:19,060
Okay.

880
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,560
What's with the fellow? 
 What's with the camera?

881
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:23,990
Yeah, we're obviously just here 
 cause there was a phone call

882
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:26,420
from the, a member of the public, um, 
 about a bit of disturbance.

883
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:28,620
Um, some loud noises.

884
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:30,470
- Possibly a forced entry, wasn't there? 
 - Um...

885
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:32,720
And, also, maybe a bit of smoke coming out, so...

886
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:35,260
We're just checking over the scene. 
 Making sure every thing's uh...

887
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,340
You know, above board sort of speaking, uh...

888
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,210
Making sure no ones in danger, 
 that kind of thing.

889
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,060
We might go up and have a wee look up there, 
 if that's alright with you?

890
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:44,720
- Come on mate, you lead the way. 
 - Just a little tour. Yeah.

891
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,120
Okay.

892
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:49,180
- Smells a bit weird here too, mate. 
 - Yeah.

893
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:50,750
What do you call that?

894
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:54,000
Barbecue.

895
00:51:56,970 --> 00:52:00,550
You will not notice anything 
 out of the ordinary.

896
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:02,900
No, we certainly hope not. 
 Let's just...

897
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:04,380
Lets just keep going.

898
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,830
- Hi there guys. How are yah? 
 - Hello.

899
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:07,850
Hi fellas.

900
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,640
We've just wondering where 
 all the shouting was coming from?

901
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:11,850
That was me.

902
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:14,210
Yeah, okay, we've had a couple reports, okay?

903
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:16,190
A couple of people not happy 
 with the level of noise here.

904
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:16,630
Okay.

905
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:18,320
The neighbors?

906
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,480
You got neighbors on either side.

907
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:21,640
Feeling nervous.

908
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,640
I've hypnotized those cops.

909
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:27,070
I'm not a great hypothesizer 
 so it could wear off any second.

910
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:29,720
I really hope that those guys 
 don't kill those police

911
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,700
because then this means 
 more police will come.

912
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:36,120
Possibly even Christians which is totally 
 the last things we need in this house.

913
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,590
I can see you're having a good time. 
 End of the day...

914
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:40,330
... we got to keep the, uh, 
 the peace, okay?

915
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:41,700
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

916
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:43,880
See what I'm seeing?

917
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:45,170
Is that even ok?

918
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:47,650
You're joking?

919
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,330
Not a smoke alarm in sight.

920
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:51,740
No smoke detectors, mate?

921
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,460
Rule number 1:

922
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:55,060
Smoke detectors.

923
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:55,920
Okay.

924
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,360
Rule number 2: maybe not 
 so many barbeque's inside.

925
00:52:58,740 --> 00:52:59,940
- Sorry fellas. 
 - Okay.

926
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:02,820
- Barbeque's? 
 - That was really strong there, ain't it?

927
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:03,830
What kind of marinade?

928
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:05,250
Who's this guy?

929
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,020
Um...

930
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,940
It's a friend who came to our party.

931
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:11,280
Mate, you're alright?

932
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,780
- He's drunk. 
 - That's what I thought.

933
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:14,140
Drunk guy.

934
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:16,390
You can't just leave him down 
 here like that, okay?

935
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:18,060
This guy's not having a good time.

936
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:19,720
He's gonna feel terrible tomorrow morning.

937
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:21,720
Well, he's soul is in hell, so...

938
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:24,780
Well, I don't know where's his soul's at, 
 but all I am saying, where is his blanket?

939
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,720
Who left the concrete on?

940
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:29,310
- Yeah, you can move him there? 
 - It's definitely not going to be comfortable.

941
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:31,310
- Seen anything else in there? 
 - No, I think I've seen enough.

942
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:32,930
- Okay. 
 - Hang on a minute.

943
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:34,970
What have we got here?

944
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,070
- What is that? 
 - This?

945
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,260
- Oh, this? 
 - Are you seeing this clearly as I can?

946
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:41,660
Adhesive, mate.

947
00:53:41,770 --> 00:53:43,200
That's a flammable.

948
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:44,990
And then you got a lamp on top of that.

949
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,920
Directly underneath the power source.

950
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:49,200
- That is quite bad. 
 - It's very bad.

951
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,940
And no smoke detectors again are there?

952
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:53,010
- No. 
 - Yes, there are.

953
00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:55,150
- Yes, there are. 
 - Okay, that's good.

954
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,520
Lots to think about guys.

955
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:58,850
- Yeah, lots to think about there guys. 
 - Next flat-meeting, yeah.

956
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:00,820
Yeah, good thinking, that's the thing, just...

957
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:03,010
- ... have a bit of dialogue about it. 
 - Okay.

958
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:05,350
- They've got a really good point. 
 - Wait!

959
00:54:05,350 --> 00:54:06,550
Let's kill them.

960
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:08,920
Well, let's just see what other safety...

961
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,190
- Stay here and then maybe we'll... 
 - Yeah.

962
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,140
I call into session,

963
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,720
this trial of Nick,

964
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:25,140
of Wellington.

965
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:31,970
Read the charges.

966
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:34,290
Problems we have with Nick.

967
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,560
Number 1:

968
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:38,750
You brought a human into our house.

969
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:41,980
- Which is a big no-no in the vampire world. 
 - Stu is, Stu is okay though?

970
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:44,240
Yeah, Stu is fine, so I guess we'll just...

971
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,740
... cross that one out.

972
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:47,040
Uh...

973
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,410
- Thank you Stu. 
 - Thank you Stu.

974
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:53,210
So...

975
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,740
The new number 1:

976
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:57,720
Nick's been telling people he's a vampire.

977
00:54:57,870 --> 00:55:00,670
That in turn resulted in...

978
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:04,180
... an unwanted visit from a vampire hunter.

979
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:05,760
Crime number 2:

980
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,760
This is quite a bigy, Nick.

981
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:10,660
The vampire hunter who killed Petyr.

982
00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:14,940
That's... I actually should've... 
 that should have been crime number one

983
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:16,940
but we wanted to build up to that.

984
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,220
Number 3:

985
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:21,870
Deacon doesn't like that 
 your wear the same jacket as him.

986
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:25,220
And he would like you to find 
 your own original style.

987
00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:28,030
For these crimes of which

988
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:31,430
we the vampire council find you guilty...

989
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:33,760
... you should be banished from our flat.

990
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:35,320
Indefinitely.

991
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:37,410
- Indefinitely? 
 - Indefinitely.

992
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:38,360
So I can come back?

993
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:41,880
No, no, indefinitely means that there is no end.

994
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:43,140
I thought that there was no...

995
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:45,970
No, indefinite means 
 that it's not a definite thing.

996
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:47,530
Yeah, but it's long.

997
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,040
Could be tomorrow, it could be 6 months.

998
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:50,810
NO! No, it is not tomorrow!

999
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:52,420
- You get about at least 6 moths. 
 - Banished!

1000
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:53,340
You are banished.

1001
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:55,580
But Stu, you can visit if you like.

1002
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:56,680
Thank you.

1003
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:58,890
For your crimes...

1004
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:01,000
... you will be made to suffer...

1005
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:02,510
... the procession...

1006
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:03,610
... of shame.

1007
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:06,880
I asked them Nick, 
 I asked them not to pass that sentence.

1008
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:08,440
We should do this immediately.

1009
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,440
- In my opinion. 
 - You didn't ask.

1010
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,720
You didn't ask. You were saying yes.

1011
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,200
- I did... 
 - Well, this is what's going to happen.

1012
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,200
I still think it's quite extreme.

1013
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:23,400
Let us do the procession of shame.

1014
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:24,390
Now.

1015
00:56:26,810 --> 00:56:27,560
- Shame. 
 - Shame!

1016
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,880
Shame. Shame. Shame!

1017
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:30,760
Shame!

1018
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:32,150
- Shame. 
 - Bad vampire!

1019
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:33,130
Shame.

1020
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:35,960
Should we go Stu?

1021
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:42,800
Bye Stu.

1022
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:00,740
That was a shame.

1023
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:27,760
<i>So today we have an invitation.</i>

1024
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:30,840
<i>To the big event of the year.</i>

1025
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,840
Breaking it open.

1026
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:34,970
They have burned the edges.

1027
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:38,280
- Like a treasure map or something. 
 - It looks very authentic, doesn't it?

1028
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:40,470
'Dearly departed...'

1029
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:42,060
That's us.

1030
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:46,130
'The Wellington vampire association 
 in conjunction with the

1031
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:48,130
lower-hat-vampire-witch club

1032
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:51,150
and the Kurory-zombie society

1033
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:57,870
invite you to attend The Unholy Masquerade 
 on the night of the 6th of June...

1034
00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:01,120
... starting at 6 PM.'

1035
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:04,460
- 666... 
 - Oh, yeah...

1036
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:09,080
The Unholy Masquerade of course is great time 
 for the undead community of Wellington.

1037
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:15,230
There's zombies there. 
 Vampires, banshees, all having a dance together.

1038
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,950
<i>It's all a big deal for me.</i>

1039
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:18,180
Love it.

1040
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:21,740
One year I went to 
 The Unholy Masquerade dressed as

1041
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:25,320
Whoopi Goldberg from Sister Act...

1042
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:28,420
... 1 and Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit.

1043
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:31,930
Didn't go down so well because 
 she was a nun.

1044
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,440
Vampires don't like nuns.

1045
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:38,330
<i>Of course the big deal of 
 The Unholy Masquerade</i>

1046
00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:41,060
<i>is that every year they 
 announce the guest of honor.</i>

1047
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:43,060
And...um...

1048
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:45,500
I don't know if I should be saying this but...

1049
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:47,770
I heard a little rumor

1050
00:58:47,770 --> 00:58:50,810
that the guest of honor this year...

1051
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,730
... might be me.

1052
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,630
The location...

1053
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:58,230
- Oh, yeah, where is it? 
 - Where's the location?

1054
00:58:58,250 --> 00:58:59,610
Detrol of Despair.

1055
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:02,020
And the guest of honor will be...

1056
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:07,440
Who is it? Show me.

1057
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:14,900
Hm.

1058
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:17,550
Okay.

1059
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:19,210
Okay.

1060
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,140
- Okay. Okay, that's fine. That's fine. 
 - Okay?

1061
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:30,610
Vladislav...

1062
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:32,660
... has...

1063
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:37,800
... just had a reaction to the information 
 that the guest of honor will be...

1064
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,040
... um... The Beast.

1065
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,640
The darkest part of my mind

1066
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:47,640
is reserved to The Beast.

1067
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:49,640
We can tell you a thing 
 or two about The Beast.

1068
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:52,550
You should pray that you 
 never have to see The Beast.

1069
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:54,350
This one is called The Beast.

1070
00:59:54,350 --> 00:59:57,440
And I said, 
 'Get you hands off my balls, Beast!'

1071
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,920
He may have told you 
 some stories about his

1072
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,850
great battle with The Beast.

1073
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:04,040
Yeah, oh, 
 'I fought The Beast on a cliff.'

1074
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:06,700
Oh... 'I fought The Beast in a swamp.'

1075
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:10,900
'One time I fought The Beast 
 in the toilettes of a night club.'

1076
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:12,880
Difficult battle.

1077
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,670
I hope you never see The Beast.

1078
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:18,550
The Beast.

1079
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,520
You can't go the the ball as Blade.

1080
01:00:29,570 --> 01:00:30,780
He's a vampire hunter.

1081
01:00:30,850 --> 01:00:33,300
Yeah, but vampires love Wesley Snipes.

1082
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:34,900
It's inappropriate.

1083
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:36,970
Okay, Vlad? The Green Jortes,

1084
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:39,140
or the Black Leather with the Dragon Belt?

1085
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:41,640
- We're have a mild crises here. 
 - Doesn't matter which pants you were, just...

1086
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:43,390
- What do you want with me? 
 - Just look at the pants Vlad!

1087
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:44,090
Look at the pants!

1088
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:45,680
Enough with the pants!

1089
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:47,490
- Shit, man! 
 - Holy shit!

1090
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:49,240
Oh, you look terrible.

1091
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:50,770
The black pants.

1092
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:52,300
Thank you. Get dressed!

1093
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:54,580
I don't know if I feel up to it, really.

1094
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:57,770
You don't look that great but 
 if you eat someone on the way...

1095
01:00:57,770 --> 01:01:00,560
If you ate a little bit? 
 - You could probably wear a mask or something.

1096
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:03,980
Just leave me to do my dark biding on the Internet!

1097
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:05,200
What are you biding on?

1098
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:07,470
I'm biding on a table.

1099
01:01:07,470 --> 01:01:09,470
- Are you coming or not? 
 - Not.

1100
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,850
I'm gonna go change. 
 We're leaving in 10 minutes.

1101
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:13,960
Have a good time!

1102
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:34,630
We waited often, 
 without giving into that kind of...

1103
01:01:34,770 --> 01:01:37,410
stuff which I'm really sick 
 of that but you know...

1104
01:01:37,410 --> 01:01:39,850
It just that, it's a hard frustration...

1105
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,350
takes people down.

1106
01:01:41,350 --> 01:01:43,850
Come on. Can I introduce, um...

1107
01:01:43,850 --> 01:01:46,830
- Aaron and Alisha. 
 - Hi, how are you?

1108
01:01:46,830 --> 01:01:47,800
Hi.

1109
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:51,690
- Hi. 
 - Less moaning guys.

1110
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,400
So we are at The Unholy Masquerade.

1111
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:56,810
It's great.

1112
01:01:57,110 --> 01:01:58,520
This is my mask.

1113
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,190
Which I made for the occasion.

1114
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:03,250
Hey!

1115
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:05,800
- Jackie. 
 -Yeah!

1116
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:08,020
- This is undead party. 
 - Yeah, I'm a vampire.

1117
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:08,570
You...?

1118
01:02:08,570 --> 01:02:10,280
I'm a vampire. I'm a vampire!

1119
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:12,680
- Great. 
 - Yeah, yeah.

1120
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:15,070
- So, um, who bit you? 
 - Oh, Nick.

1121
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:17,220
- Oh great. 
 - Yeah.

1122
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:18,180
Okay.

1123
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,380
Deacon!

1124
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:24,360
Pretty rude, because she was my...

1125
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:25,350
... servant.

1126
01:02:25,350 --> 01:02:27,320
She was a pretty useless servant.

1127
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:29,890
- I wouldn't... 
 - Yeah, yeah, but still, it would have been...

1128
01:02:29,890 --> 01:02:31,640
... appreciated if you'd asked...

1129
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:32,930
How's Stu?

1130
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,400
- He's good. He's here.

1131
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,400
- Oh, his here? 
 - Stu! STU!

1132
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:38,480
Hey, hey!

1133
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:39,990
Hey!

1134
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:44,530
Has anyone looked at you 
 like they want to eat you, at all?

1135
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:46,350
Ah, no...

1136
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:48,350
Can you hear me at the back?

1137
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:51,410
On behalf of the Wellington vampire society...

1138
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:55,680
... uh, with lower-hat vampire and witch club.

1139
01:02:55,680 --> 01:03:00,410
And the Kurory Zombie society, 
 we welcome you here tonight.

1140
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:04,220
We're raffling a live big pet this year, 
 you could see

1141
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,520
the prize over here on my left.

1142
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:07,980
It's a wonderful prize.

1143
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:12,550
I thinks it's a 10 dollars each or 
 45 dollars for a book of five.

1144
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:16,460
Now without further adieu, it's my very great pleasure

1145
01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:19,950
to introduce to you this years guest of honor.

1146
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:22,460
Pauline Ivanovich!

1147
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,250
Thank you.

1148
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,860
That's The Beast.

1149
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:30,700
Thank you.

1150
01:03:30,730 --> 01:03:35,090
The Beast is, uh, the name 
 I gave to my ex-girlfriend Pauline.

1151
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:37,130
She prefers Pauline.

1152
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:40,140
We had a very intense relationship.

1153
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:41,200
We were very...

1154
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,650
... sexually explosive.

1155
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:48,990
Last time I saw her, she impelled me and 
 called me an asshole.

1156
01:03:48,990 --> 01:03:50,060
She said...

1157
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:53,000
... all kinds of things that really hurt me.

1158
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:56,820
And all this while I was impelled on a lamp post.

1159
01:03:57,100 --> 01:04:02,330
Well, everyone, I will be mingling around 
 and I really hope that...

1160
01:04:02,890 --> 01:04:05,020
... I will meet...

1161
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:07,090
... all of you.

1162
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:23,800
Hello.

1163
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:25,220
That's the new guy.

1164
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:30,020
What, what kind of vampire... if he is a vampire. 
 Did you see his face?

1165
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,130
Oh... oh.

1166
01:04:34,060 --> 01:04:36,250
- Hello! 
 - Hi, how are you?

1167
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:38,510
- This is Deacon. 
 - Hello Deacon.

1168
01:04:38,510 --> 01:04:40,510
- This is Stu. 
 - Good day Stu.

1169
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:41,920
- How are you my friend? 
 - Good.

1170
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:42,900
Hi. Stu.

1171
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:45,210
You got really warm hands too.

1172
01:04:45,350 --> 01:04:47,040
You a demon?

1173
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:50,280
- No, he's not a demon! 
 - I'm a software analyst.

1174
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:53,000
- Stu, Stu, Stu... 
 - Am I a witch?

1175
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,060
Go dance, uh, with anyone.

1176
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:56,740
- Sure. 
 - Okay, take your time.

1177
01:04:56,740 --> 01:05:01,560
I like Stu. He's not vampire, or a zombie...

1178
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:03,130
- Am I a witch? 
 - He's not...

1179
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:06,830
He not uh... he's neither, 
 he's uh... more of a human.

1180
01:05:08,650 --> 01:05:11,250
Excuse me, excuse me. 
 Hi, Nick, hey.

1181
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:12,940
Um, Nick...

1182
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:16,520
Do you mind if Stu is killed?

1183
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:18,330
Uh, I don't feel real good about it.

1184
01:05:18,330 --> 01:05:22,780
Can I, can I just ask you, you know, a...

1185
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:24,280
- ... a personal question? 
 - Sure.

1186
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:27,570
Are you, um....

1187
01:05:28,830 --> 01:05:31,820
... are you, are you, 
 are you predeceased?

1188
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:34,140
Uh...

1189
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:38,240
If anyone's gonna eat him is gonna be us but 
 we're not, we're passed it.

1190
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:39,800
They can just go fuck themselves.

1191
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,340
Nick! It is your fault.

1192
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:45,370
Okay? You brought a human 
 into this den of vampis nest.

1193
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:47,070
- You're not helping. 
 - Yes, you did.

1194
01:05:47,070 --> 01:05:49,780
- Plus one. 
 - Lovely talking to you, I've got to shout off now.

1195
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:51,130
See you later on.

1196
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:59,360
As soon as one vampire takes a bite, 
 it's a frenzy!

1197
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:00,590
- A frenzy! 
 - Okay, we've got to get him out.

1198
01:06:00,590 --> 01:06:02,530
Okay, follow me, follow me.

1199
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:05,200
Excuse me, sorry guys.

1200
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:06,520
Okay, Stu.

1201
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:08,890
Put that over your red face.

1202
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:11,160
- Just going out for a cigarette. 
 - Oh, hey!

1203
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:13,160
- Okay, not that way. 
 - This way.

1204
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:15,160
- This way. 
 - Is there another way?

1205
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,630
- Get away from the vampires. 
 - Guys...

1206
01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:20,860
Excuse me everyone!

1207
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:23,140
Can I have your attention please.

1208
01:06:23,950 --> 01:06:28,880
Some of the vampires forget 
 Unholy Masquerade rules.

1209
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,880
They brought a human.

1210
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:36,130
And they don't let us to feast on him.

1211
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:39,470
This was a total misunderstanding.

1212
01:06:39,470 --> 01:06:42,950
There was on the invitation, 
 and this actually pertains to you...

1213
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:44,640
... the invitation, it said,

1214
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:47,000
- plus one, but it did not specify... 
 - Okay.

1215
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,780
- Wait, look... 
 - If it could be a human or

1216
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:50,010
if it could be werewolf or...

1217
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:52,610
Yeah, but he could be 
 a vampire hunter for all we know.

1218
01:06:52,610 --> 01:06:55,620
He could texting his mates, saying, 
 'I've got them all under one place

1219
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:57,830
come on over. 
 We'll have a vampire barbecue!'

1220
01:06:58,100 --> 01:06:59,760
Well, he's not, he's not doing that.

1221
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:01,220
How do we know that?

1222
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:02,810
He's wearing a bow-tie, look at him!

1223
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:04,000
Stu, tell them what you do.

1224
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,440
Come on Stu! 
 Tell us what you do. Come on.

1225
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:07,810
Tell them what you do, Stu.

1226
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,070
- Hi, my name is Stu uh... 
 - Don't fuck it up, man.

1227
01:07:10,070 --> 01:07:11,170
- I can't hear Stu. 
 - Louder, louder!

1228
01:07:11,170 --> 01:07:13,500
Hi, my name is Stu, uh, I work in...

1229
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:14,400
- I can't hear... 
 - Louder.

1230
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,170
Stu can't hear, they cannot hear you.

1231
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:21,060
Hi, my name is Stu. I'm a software analyst. 
 I work for a geographic information system company.

1232
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:22,530
-Uh... 
 - Sorry, what is it?

1233
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:24,740
I work for a company that does

1234
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:28,250
basically we take like 
 business requirements from organizations.

1235
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:32,260
Then we analyze those requirements and 
 then we build software

1236
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:33,480
to fit those requirements.

1237
01:07:33,870 --> 01:07:36,140
He is a virgin. He is a virgin!

1238
01:07:36,140 --> 01:07:39,240
- I can smell a virgin of a thousand paces. 
 - Go on then.

1239
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:42,540
Take your thousand paces and smell yourselves!

1240
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:44,390
I can't wait till you moan them.

1241
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:00,160
There should be no eating of the human.

1242
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,740
Who are you all of a sudden?

1243
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:04,680
You have forgotten your former lover.

1244
01:08:04,730 --> 01:08:06,350
So quickly.

1245
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:10,760
Georgie?

1246
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:12,760
No, not...

1247
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:15,570
... Georgie, like, 5-years Saturday.

1248
01:08:15,570 --> 01:08:16,490
No.

1249
01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:18,260
Wait a minute.

1250
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:19,960
Just one moment.

1251
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:21,000
No...

1252
01:08:21,390 --> 01:08:23,810
No, I've got it, it's coming, take it away...

1253
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,380
Hello Beast.

1254
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:29,700
Hello asshole.

1255
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:32,870
- Hey, don't call me asshole! 
 - Don't call me...

1256
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:36,160
... Beast. This is Vladislav. This is me ex-boyfriend. 
 - This is absolutely the same.

1257
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:39,410
- You know, the one who fucked the police... 
 - Alright, that's old business, that's...

1258
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:40,400
- ... personal business. 
 - Yeah.

1259
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:42,640
- Nice to meet you asshole. 
 - This is my lover.

1260
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:45,040
You will not feast on the blood 
 of the human known as Stu.

1261
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:47,580
Listen asshole, this is a human and

1262
01:08:47,580 --> 01:08:49,720
this is the rules and 
 what is cameras doing here?

1263
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,920
One, and then another one, 
 what is this?

1264
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,720
They're making a documentary on...

1265
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:55,330
This is a private secret society mate,

1266
01:08:55,330 --> 01:08:57,580
you don't go bringing your 
 bloody cameras into everything.

1267
01:08:57,580 --> 01:09:00,390
You will not eat Stu and 
 you will not eat the camera guy.

1268
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:03,290
- Maybe one camera guy... 
 - I'm up to bloody here, with you at the moment.

1269
01:09:03,290 --> 01:09:05,770
And all your mates behind there, 
 whoever the hell they are.

1270
01:09:05,770 --> 01:09:07,460
We're gonna eat the human being.

1271
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:09,330
And there's nothing you can do about it, alright?

1272
01:09:09,330 --> 01:09:10,340
Now back off!

1273
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:11,960
And let my misses get her way.

1274
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:13,720
Oh, there's nothing I can do about it?

1275
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,700
- That's right. 
 - Well, what about this?

1276
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:19,370
Diego, rip his head off.

1277
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:20,940
What do you want?!

1278
01:09:21,350 --> 01:09:23,040
Vampire fight!

1279
01:09:23,770 --> 01:09:25,160
Get him Vladislav!

1280
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,460
Rip his head off!

1281
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:41,620
He's killing him!

1282
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:44,120
It is forbidden for vampires...

1283
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:45,700
... to kill a vampire.

1284
01:09:48,230 --> 01:09:50,380
- What the f... 
 - Medic!

1285
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:53,160
What?

1286
01:09:53,930 --> 01:09:56,680
Are you okay, love? 
 Get out!

1287
01:09:57,030 --> 01:09:58,920
We should probably go Stu.

1288
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:01,620
It was great to see you,

1289
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:03,620
- Pauline. 
 - Asshole!

1290
01:10:03,630 --> 01:10:04,480
Perfect.

1291
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:08,010
- That was very... how we both... 
 - He's a murderer!

1292
01:10:08,010 --> 01:10:11,620
We both, together, 
 equally destroyed that guy!

1293
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:14,240
Yeah, but it was more Stu 
 with the giant stick!

1294
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:17,120
I hope this doesn't make this awkward 
 for you and The Beast.

1295
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:20,360
No, I think it's opened up new possibilities.

1296
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:22,160
Oh, no.

1297
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:24,880
Here we go again.

1298
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,880
Stu, Stu, Stu, Stu!

1299
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,940
Stu, Stu, STU!

1300
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:31,220
Stu, Stu, Stu, Stu...

1301
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:34,210
- Stuuu... Stuuu... 
 - Wait, wait, wait, wait, stop!

1302
01:10:34,210 --> 01:10:35,510
Listen, listen!

1303
01:10:35,950 --> 01:10:37,150
You smell that?

1304
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,020
This way.

1305
01:10:41,490 --> 01:10:42,750
Werewolves.

1306
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:46,100
- Oh, no. 
 - Look what the cat dragged in, huh?

1307
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:48,780
- Piss off. 
 - Keep walking. Don't hassle us tonight.

1308
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:50,780
There has been no hassle here.

1309
01:10:50,870 --> 01:10:52,450
Well, let it stay that way.

1310
01:10:52,450 --> 01:10:54,050
Keep chaining yourselves up!

1311
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:56,050
Guys, where's your track suite pants?

1312
01:10:56,050 --> 01:10:57,640
It was washing night.

1313
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:59,960
My misses couldn't wash them cause 
 there was too much blood on them.

1314
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:02,360
When your legs expand they go into the track suit.

1315
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,770
- Oh! 
 - Those jeans are gonna rip completely!

1316
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:06,490
You've lost all those trousers, guys?

1317
01:11:06,630 --> 01:11:08,710
Declan, that tree's far too thin!

1318
01:11:08,710 --> 01:11:10,050
Look at it! It's like a branch!

1319
01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:12,430
You don't know how big you get 
 when you transform!

1320
01:11:12,430 --> 01:11:14,430
That's the wrong tree for you.

1321
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:16,000
Anton, I've...

1322
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,220
Oh, no, you've forgot the combination.

1323
01:11:18,590 --> 01:11:20,310
Why did you get a combination lock?

1324
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:21,720
I lost my key last time.

1325
01:11:21,830 --> 01:11:24,610
Okay, well, it's probably 4 zeros, 
 that's the factory setting, is it?

1326
01:11:24,610 --> 01:11:26,340
- Fuck off to a tree. 
 - Hey!

1327
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:27,950
Werewolves, not swearwolves.

1328
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:29,950
Yeah, I know, well on transformation nights,

1329
01:11:29,950 --> 01:11:31,950
it's alright, alright? 
  I'm getting stressed out.

1330
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,320
I was just reminding you.

1331
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:35,980
Stop talking and chain yourself up you dickhead!

1332
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:37,380
Honestly, we're transforming.

1333
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:38,740
Alright, we'll keep walking.

1334
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:41,610
- Yeah, keep walking. By the way I find that offensive! 
 - We'll keep walking.

1335
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:42,750
Is it fur?

1336
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:44,140
Oh, for crying out loud.

1337
01:11:44,310 --> 01:11:47,250
Don't look at the fur everyone. 
 Get back to your trees, okay?

1338
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:48,910
- That's disgusting, man. 
 - You're wearing fur.

1339
01:11:48,910 --> 01:11:50,140
Declan!

1340
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:51,600
- That's not real fur. 
 - Oh, shit!

1341
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:56,210
Honestly, get out of here. 
 Take your humans!

1342
01:11:56,210 --> 01:11:58,210
The guy in the bow-tie, he's gonna go first!

1343
01:11:59,570 --> 01:12:00,950
Get out of here!

1344
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:04,000
Take all your coats off if you want to keep everyone!

1345
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:05,940
Take that army service jacket off...

1346
01:12:09,390 --> 01:12:11,340
Get that camera out of my face!

1347
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:13,340
Go, go! Let's go, let's go. Come on!

1348
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,440
Run, Stu, RUN!

1349
01:12:19,190 --> 01:12:20,720
Let's go, let's go!

1350
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,840
- They're coming, guys! 
 - Shit!

1351
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:29,540
I got one!

1352
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:49,410
My leg! My leg!

1353
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:55,550
Oh, God!

1354
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:57,970
Stu! Stu!

1355
01:12:57,970 --> 01:12:59,060
STU!

1356
01:13:03,690 --> 01:13:04,560
Stu!

1357
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:07,380
Get off me!

1358
01:13:08,620 --> 01:13:10,280
Stu, are you alright?!

1359
01:13:11,150 --> 01:13:12,160
Stu!

1360
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:14,350
Stu!

1361
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:16,320
Ah, fuck!

1362
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:21,800
Fuck off!

1363
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:23,520
Get off me!

1364
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:27,550
You stinky piece of assholes!

1365
01:13:32,860 --> 01:13:34,610
Stupid werewolves!

1366
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:36,140
Look away Nick!

1367
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:38,140
Don't look at their blood!

1368
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:39,990
Stu!

1369
01:13:40,190 --> 01:13:42,880
He's a really good dude! 
 Leave him alone!

1370
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:43,930
It's too late for him!

1371
01:13:43,930 --> 01:13:46,120
- Don't look at the blood Nick! 
 - Stu!

1372
01:13:58,070 --> 01:13:59,880
There he is.

1373
01:14:01,630 --> 01:14:04,670
He's probably still a little upset 
 having seen his

1374
01:14:04,670 --> 01:14:08,000
best friend disemboweled by werewolves.

1375
01:14:10,130 --> 01:14:11,290
Nick!

1376
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,260
I found you.

1377
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:15,960
Whoa!

1378
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:20,400
That was pretty full on, heh?

1379
01:14:26,410 --> 01:14:29,200
But this is what happens 
 when you are a vampire.

1380
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:32,200
You have to watch everyone die.

1381
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:36,520
You're mother and father.

1382
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:37,940
All your friends.

1383
01:14:38,180 --> 01:14:39,810
Sometimes brutal.

1384
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:45,660
Like slipping and falling onto a giant spike.

1385
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:47,530
Or falling asleep.

1386
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:50,320
In an autumn pile of leaves,

1387
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:54,400
and having some of them, 
 block your wind pipe.

1388
01:14:55,010 --> 01:14:57,580
Or making the simple mistake,

1389
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:00,680
of fashioning a mask out of crackers,

1390
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:02,680
and being attacked by ducks.

1391
01:15:02,930 --> 01:15:04,190
Geese.

1392
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,220
Swans.

1393
01:15:06,850 --> 01:15:08,880
Or simply dieing of old age.

1394
01:15:11,470 --> 01:15:13,940
But even old age is brutal.

1395
01:15:14,390 --> 01:15:16,010
Watching your friends...

1396
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:17,240
... grow old.

1397
01:15:17,510 --> 01:15:19,460
They can't piss.

1398
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:23,340
And they say stupid things and 
 their brains go and they

1399
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:25,340
can't remember anything.

1400
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:30,880
And then, one day, they can't even 
 remember who you are.

1401
01:15:32,210 --> 01:15:34,350
And you wish they were dead.

1402
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:36,780
And then they do die.

1403
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:41,240
No.

1404
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:43,240
If I know Stu...

1405
01:15:43,890 --> 01:15:46,590
... this was probably the way he wanted to go.

1406
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:49,620
Disemboweled by werewolves.

1407
01:15:50,490 --> 01:15:51,940
Blood and guts,

1408
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:53,940
splat onto the trees.

1409
01:15:54,210 --> 01:15:56,660
His face torned to shreds.

1410
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:08,630
I hope I made you feel better.

1411
01:16:15,050 --> 01:16:17,460
<i>Ah, well, from what we 
 could see in the beginning</i>

1412
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:19,900
<i>it looks like there's been 
 a bit of a dog attack.</i>

1413
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:21,500
<i>That's really what happens, 
 when you get, you know...</i>

1414
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:22,660
<i>dangerous dogs.</i>

1415
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:24,480
<i>Um, straits, not being looked after.</i>

1416
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:25,780
This is not good.

1417
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:28,160
No, not good at all.

1418
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,580
There's nicer ways to go, then being...

1419
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:34,650
... torn apart, by what looks like a pack of dogs, 
 more than just one.

1420
01:16:34,650 --> 01:16:37,030
- I say so. 
 - These attacks have been happening more, more frequent.

1421
01:16:37,030 --> 01:16:40,360
They're happening on a monthly bases and 
 and it's just no good for anybody, okay?

1422
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:42,560
Specially not the dogs. 
 Certainly not the community.

1423
01:16:42,710 --> 01:16:44,440
I've got the bastard.

1424
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:45,880
One of them here, hey?

1425
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,690
That's what I'm talking about. 
 Look at it.

1426
01:16:47,690 --> 01:16:49,980
End of the day, 
 this dog is gonna have to be put down.

1427
01:16:50,140 --> 01:16:51,490
What a shame.

1428
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:54,050
Look what you did.

1429
01:16:54,390 --> 01:16:55,130
Hey?

1430
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:58,430
He's got the scent again, hasn't he? 
 He wants to go again. He's not finished.

1431
01:16:58,430 --> 01:16:59,050
Yeah.

1432
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:32,060
<i>They say that vampires hearts are cold and dead.</i>

1433
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:34,630
<i>Definitely dead.</i>

1434
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:37,860
- Bye Stu. 
 - He would have loved his scarf.

1435
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:40,000
It was lovely, loose, knit.

1436
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:44,200
<i>But I don't know. 
 I think I still feel things inside it.</i>

1437
01:17:48,210 --> 01:17:49,370
Deacon!

1438
01:17:50,620 --> 01:17:51,760
Deacon!

1439
01:17:51,870 --> 01:17:54,350
Deacon, wakey, wakey. Hey!

1440
01:17:54,350 --> 01:17:57,720
You don't sleep in here. 
 The curtain's opened. It's nearly morning.

1441
01:17:57,810 --> 01:18:00,230
You want to get sizzled to a crisp.

1442
01:18:00,370 --> 01:18:03,230
You know, you could think 
 a little about these things.

1443
01:18:03,230 --> 01:18:03,620
Okay.

1444
01:18:03,710 --> 01:18:05,700
- Sorry Viago. 
 - It's okay.

1445
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:07,800
- Night, night! Okay.

1446
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:37,520
Received at 4:20 AM:

1447
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:02,100
- Stu?! 
 - Hey, Deacon.

1448
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:03,900
- Stu! 
 - How is it?

1449
01:19:04,710 --> 01:19:05,720
Good to see you.

1450
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:06,760
Look at his face!

1451
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:08,320
I saw them tear you to shreds!

1452
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:09,580
Look! He looks like Seal!

1453
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:11,010
They didn't kill me.

1454
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:13,280
- It looks cool. 
 - Thank you, thank you.

1455
01:19:13,390 --> 01:19:14,640
Meet some of our friends.

1456
01:19:15,030 --> 01:19:16,600
Anton, Deacon.

1457
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:18,790
Hi, Anton.

1458
01:19:22,580 --> 01:19:24,560
I must have blacked out.

1459
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:26,040
And then, I remember,

1460
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:27,480
- an ambulance. 
 - He's going into shock.

1461
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:29,430
O'Leary. O'Leary!

1462
01:19:29,430 --> 01:19:31,040
Yeah, coming!

1463
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:33,320
- Okay, calm down, mate. 
 - Calm down.

1464
01:19:36,780 --> 01:19:38,040
Looks like rabies, doesn't it?

1465
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:40,880
And I don't know how long after that was, 
 but like, woke up.

1466
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:43,930
And it was daytime.

1467
01:19:47,660 --> 01:19:49,560
<i>And I couldn't find my clothes.</i>

1468
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:53,750
<i>Those werewolves guys...</i>

1469
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:55,050
<i>... eventually found me.</i>

1470
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:57,040
<i>And they had some,</i>

1471
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:59,040
<i>they like, lent me some pants.</i>

1472
01:20:00,110 --> 01:20:02,110
<i>So, yeah, those guys have been supporting me.</i>

1473
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:04,110
<i>Cause I was quite confused.</i>

1474
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,840
Yeah, these are the guys who, um,

1475
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:09,520
turned me into a werewolf.

1476
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,410
You knit your own jersey?

1477
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,310
- Yes. 
 - Oh, yeah?

1478
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:15,360
- I knit. 
 - Is that the moon, or?

1479
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:17,980
- Yes. 
 - Hopefully, we won't, you know...

1480
01:20:21,130 --> 01:20:22,570
Ah, this is a nice place.

1481
01:20:22,570 --> 01:20:25,360
Please, don't, ah, don't lick anything or...

1482
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:27,360
... pee on anything.

1483
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:29,220
We were worried at first, you know, we thought

1484
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:31,630
'Ooh, they are just going to urinate on everything.'

1485
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:35,110
<i>But they actually are really polite and pretty clean.</i>

1486
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:37,860
There was obviously that werewolves smell,

1487
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:41,220
<i>which permeated the entire house 
 for the first half an hour.</i>

1488
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:44,210
But we opened some windows and 
 got rid of that.

1489
01:20:44,210 --> 01:20:46,500
<i>'What a stupid suggestion, their idea,' I thought.</i>

1490
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:47,320
<i>No way.</i>

1491
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:50,010
<i>You know, walking into the vampire's den. 
 That's ludicrous.</i>

1492
01:20:50,010 --> 01:20:51,280
That's my hand.

1493
01:20:51,350 --> 01:20:53,230
But I thought, we'll give it a shot.

1494
01:20:53,230 --> 01:20:55,400
You know, I'm the alpha male, 
 so I made the call.

1495
01:20:55,630 --> 01:20:56,920
I'm the alpha male.

1496
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:59,220
- Yes. 
 - So, generally...

1497
01:20:59,270 --> 01:21:00,510
... all of the other guys follow me.

1498
01:21:00,510 --> 01:21:01,650
- For Stu! 
 - For STU!

1499
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:02,890
Thanks guys.

1500
01:21:02,890 --> 01:21:04,490
What have you done to your face?

1501
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:06,880
I got attacked by some werewolves.

1502
01:21:06,940 --> 01:21:10,320
Army is a werewolf. 
 Seemed like a very nice person.

1503
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:12,800
So, Katherine is a vampire now.

1504
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,860
- Yes. 
 - We decide to get together.

1505
01:21:14,860 --> 01:21:16,640
<i>We just thought, the hell with it, you know.</i>

1506
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:18,110
<i>What have we got to lose?</i>

1507
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:21,140
<i>I was just sitting, doing nothing,</i>

1508
01:21:21,140 --> 01:21:24,210
<i>and he came floating in and over to me,</i>

1509
01:21:24,210 --> 01:21:26,900
<i>and I recognized him. 
 It was wonderful.</i>

1510
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:28,900
And then I bit you on the neck.

1511
01:21:29,610 --> 01:21:31,160
That's right.

1512
01:21:32,230 --> 01:21:34,340
And I don't mind being a vampire.

1513
01:21:34,340 --> 01:21:36,340
I'm enjoying it.

1514
01:21:37,620 --> 01:21:40,280
Some people freak out a bit 
 about the age difference.

1515
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:44,020
Uh, they think, 
 'what's this 96-year old lady doing with a guy,

1516
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:45,790
for times her age.'

1517
01:21:45,930 --> 01:21:48,920
- And, you know, I don't care... 
 - It doesn't make any difference.

1518
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:51,410
No, they can call me cradle-snatcher, who cares.

1519
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:54,560
I decided to bite her and 
 we're gonna be together forever.

1520
01:21:54,740 --> 01:21:56,180
- Wonderful. 
 - Yeah.

1521
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:15,740
<i>Pauline and I are tentatively back together.</i>

1522
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:19,400
<i>But it's not long before 
 you remember why it was we</i>

1523
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:21,400
broke up in the first place.

1524
01:22:25,990 --> 01:22:27,180
We start in our bedroom,

1525
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:30,200
and I need that totally boarded up or 
 blacked out somehow.

1526
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:31,840
My husband is my familiar.

1527
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,710
So, there has been a dynamic shift there.

1528
01:22:34,730 --> 01:22:37,880
You could buy a Bedazzler. 
 So you write that down. That's B-E-D...

1529
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:40,680
I feel like I'm where I need to be now.

1530
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:43,140
- I love you. 
 - I love you too.

1531
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:44,060
Great.

1532
01:22:45,110 --> 01:22:46,540
But I am your Master.

1533
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:48,410
- Okay? 
 - Yeah.

1534
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:51,530
Yeah, these guys have to laugh 
 at my jokes, right guys?

1535
01:22:51,690 --> 01:22:53,160
Yeah!

1536
01:22:53,790 --> 01:22:54,790
That is a good one.

1537
01:22:54,790 --> 01:22:56,930
I always look round to 
 make sure they're all laughing.

1538
01:22:56,930 --> 01:22:59,290
Like, if I see one of them is not 
 quite laughing I'll be like, 'Hey!'

1539
01:22:59,290 --> 01:23:01,430
'You laughing?', 
 and often I'll test you.

1540
01:23:01,430 --> 01:23:02,900
- What are you laughing at, Justin?

1541
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:04,600
- Hey? 
 - What are you laughing at now?

1542
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:06,600
- Just then? 
 - Yeah, yeah, but what?

1543
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:07,690
Oh, I don't know.

1544
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:11,010
Ah, test failed! Test failed!

1545
01:23:11,010 --> 01:23:13,430
You're laughing now. 
 What are you laughing at now though?

1546
01:23:13,710 --> 01:23:14,890
I don't know cause...

1547
01:23:14,890 --> 01:23:17,780
Ah, another failure!

1548
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:19,490
Well, what are you laughing at Stu?

1549
01:23:19,710 --> 01:23:21,240
Oh, I was laughing with the group.

1550
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:23,020
Yep, that's good. That's good, yeah.

1551
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:26,640
Just pay attention. Pay attention.

1552
