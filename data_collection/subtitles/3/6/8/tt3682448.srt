1
00:03:42,257 --> 00:03:43,959
<i>The next stop is Broad Street.</i>

2
00:03:43,992 --> 00:03:45,327
<i>Broad Street will be next.</i>

3
00:04:57,032 --> 00:04:58,267
Upstairs. This way.

4
00:05:07,609 --> 00:05:09,211
He didn't come up this way?
Anything?

5
00:05:09,244 --> 00:05:11,013
He's not up here.
Go back down.

6
00:05:13,448 --> 00:05:14,950
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

7
00:05:34,202 --> 00:05:36,271
Go ahead and park
around the corner.

8
00:08:48,763 --> 00:08:51,266
Visitors.

9
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:52,667
Do you mind
if I fetch my teeth?

10
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:54,636
Colonel, would you
turn around, please?

11
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:58,740
Sit down on the bed.

12
00:08:58,773 --> 00:09:00,242
Let's go.

13
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:11,586
Uh, they're in the...
The teeth are in the...
On the sink.

14
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,455
Look at me. We are agents

15
00:09:13,488 --> 00:09:15,590
from the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

16
00:09:15,624 --> 00:09:16,691
Look at me!

17
00:09:16,725 --> 00:09:18,493
I'm talking to you.

18
00:09:18,527 --> 00:09:20,328
We've received information

19
00:09:20,362 --> 00:09:22,631
concerning your
involvement in espionage.

20
00:09:22,664 --> 00:09:24,666
You can either cooperate
with us right now,

21
00:09:24,699 --> 00:09:26,301
or you'll be under arrest.

22
00:09:26,334 --> 00:09:27,269
Do you understand, Colonel?

23
00:09:27,302 --> 00:09:29,237
No, not really.

24
00:09:29,271 --> 00:09:32,574
Why do you
keep calling me "Colonel"?

25
00:09:32,607 --> 00:09:34,376
You need
to get dressed.

26
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:36,444
We have to search
your apartment.

27
00:09:36,478 --> 00:09:40,549
Would you mind if I, uh,
cleaned my palette?

28
00:09:40,582 --> 00:09:43,385
The paints,
it'll get ruined otherwise.

29
00:09:43,418 --> 00:09:44,753
It's just behind you there.

30
00:09:46,755 --> 00:09:48,723
I have a cloth myself.

31
00:09:48,757 --> 00:09:49,824
Thank you.

32
00:09:49,858 --> 00:09:52,594
All right, start searching the place.
Thank you.

33
00:09:52,627 --> 00:09:53,762
All right,
search the mattress,

34
00:09:53,795 --> 00:09:55,030
the bed, the floorboards,
his chair.

35
00:09:55,063 --> 00:09:57,332
Would you put that
in the ashtray on the windowsill there?

36
00:09:57,365 --> 00:09:58,900
Take a good look
at that desk.

37
00:10:02,704 --> 00:10:04,239
Let's see the desk.

38
00:10:10,912 --> 00:10:12,581
Wouldn't want
to get this ruined.

39
00:10:26,861 --> 00:10:29,297
<i>Don't say "my guy."</i>

40
00:10:29,331 --> 00:10:32,334
<i>He's not "my guy."</i>

41
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:35,403
Yes, he's "your guy."
Who are we talking about?

42
00:10:35,437 --> 00:10:39,374
We're talking about a guy
who was insured by my client.

43
00:10:39,407 --> 00:10:41,376
So, don't make him "my guy."

44
00:10:42,377 --> 00:10:43,912
Okay, fine.

45
00:10:43,945 --> 00:10:47,515
My point is, the guy
insured by your client,

46
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:50,318
he doesn't deny that
any of these things happened.

47
00:10:50,352 --> 00:10:52,887
"These... These things"?

48
00:10:52,921 --> 00:10:55,557
Yes,
these five things.

49
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,359
Wait, hold it,
hold it, hold it.

50
00:10:57,392 --> 00:10:58,660
Not five things.

51
00:10:58,693 --> 00:11:00,662
One thing.

52
00:11:00,695 --> 00:11:01,796
Clearly,
it's five things.

53
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,565
Well, I'm sorry,
it's not clear to me.

54
00:11:03,598 --> 00:11:06,401
Five things?
Explain it to me.

55
00:11:06,434 --> 00:11:07,669
It's self-evident.

56
00:11:07,702 --> 00:11:09,571
Okay, then tell me
what happened.

57
00:11:09,604 --> 00:11:12,941
Tell me the story in a way
that makes sense for five things.

58
00:11:12,974 --> 00:11:15,377
Fine, absolutely.
Your guy is...

59
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:16,745
Not my guy.
Insured by my client.

60
00:11:16,778 --> 00:11:18,413
The guy insured
by your client

61
00:11:18,446 --> 00:11:19,914
is driving down
State Highway 19

62
00:11:19,948 --> 00:11:22,550
when he loses control
of his car and hits my five guys,

63
00:11:22,584 --> 00:11:24,686
the five guys who hired me
to represent them

64
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:26,154
because you're not
honoring your claim.

65
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:29,891
You mean my client is not
honoring the claim, the insurance company?

66
00:11:29,924 --> 00:11:32,560
Mr. Donovan,
we're all clear on who's who, here.

67
00:11:32,594 --> 00:11:35,397
Except my client
honors every claim.

68
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,531
They do, Mr. Bates.

69
00:11:36,564 --> 00:11:37,899
Every single
legitimate claim,

70
00:11:37,932 --> 00:11:39,567
up to the limit
of their liability,

71
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:41,736
which is $100,000
per accident,

72
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,905
in the case of
this man's policy.

73
00:11:43,938 --> 00:11:45,106
And this is one claim.

74
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:48,843
According to your description,
"He hit my five guys."

75
00:11:48,877 --> 00:11:51,880
The guy insured by my client
had one accident.

76
00:11:51,913 --> 00:11:53,148
One, one, one.

77
00:11:53,181 --> 00:11:56,718
Losing control of the car and
hitting five motorcyclists.

78
00:11:56,751 --> 00:11:58,953
From their point of view,
five things happened.

79
00:12:00,021 --> 00:12:02,824
Well, look, Bob.
May I? Bob?

80
00:12:03,825 --> 00:12:05,927
"Jim."

81
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,730
If I go bowling and I throw
a strike, one thing happened.

82
00:12:08,763 --> 00:12:09,831
Ten things didn't happen.

83
00:12:09,864 --> 00:12:11,900
Jim, my guys
aren't bowling pins,

84
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:13,635
as much as your guy
may have treated them as such.

85
00:12:13,668 --> 00:12:14,969
If... Let me finish.
Let me finish.

86
00:12:15,003 --> 00:12:17,806
If your house
is insured for $100,000

87
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,841
and a tornado
carries it away,

88
00:12:19,874 --> 00:12:21,543
it carried away one house.

89
00:12:21,576 --> 00:12:23,011
It didn't pick up
every stick of furniture

90
00:12:23,044 --> 00:12:25,714
and destroy it
in a separate incident.

91
00:12:25,747 --> 00:12:28,483
If that is
what you're saying,

92
00:12:28,516 --> 00:12:31,753
well, then there is never
any limit to our liability

93
00:12:31,786 --> 00:12:34,789
and that is the end
of the insurance business.

94
00:12:34,823 --> 00:12:36,991
And then, Bob,
nobody is safe.

95
00:12:42,697 --> 00:12:44,899
Watters, Cowan and Donovan.
How may I direct your call?

96
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:46,568
Morning, Mr. Donovan.

97
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:47,902
Good morning, Alison.

98
00:12:47,936 --> 00:12:49,871
I moved your 9:00 a.m.
with Prudential, sir.

99
00:12:49,904 --> 00:12:51,005
Why did you do that?

100
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,607
I asked her to.

101
00:12:53,575 --> 00:12:54,876
Is everything
all right, Tom?

102
00:12:54,909 --> 00:12:57,579
Why don't you leave your stuff with Alison.
Come on inside.

103
00:12:58,747 --> 00:13:00,014
Something pretty important
has come up.

104
00:13:00,048 --> 00:13:01,783
Somebody's here to see us.

105
00:13:01,816 --> 00:13:03,651
Natalie's getting
your coffee.

106
00:13:03,685 --> 00:13:06,454
Nescafe, cream, two lumps,
right?

107
00:13:06,488 --> 00:13:07,756
That's right. Thanks.

108
00:13:09,824 --> 00:13:11,025
Lynn!
Jim!

109
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:12,927
Nice to see you again.
How's the family?

110
00:13:12,961 --> 00:13:14,763
Great, good. Thanks.
How's Annie?

111
00:13:14,796 --> 00:13:17,031
Homicidal. We had
the in-laws for the holiday.

112
00:13:17,065 --> 00:13:19,305
Well, if she acts on it,
she'll have good representation.

113
00:13:20,101 --> 00:13:21,636
Now, what's up?

114
00:13:28,076 --> 00:13:29,978
Okay, here's the thing.

115
00:13:30,011 --> 00:13:33,515
The Soviet spy they caught,
we want you to defend him.

116
00:13:33,548 --> 00:13:34,816
Here's the indictment.

117
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:39,020
Wow.

118
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:42,757
I'm not sure
I wanna pick that up.

119
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,826
The accused
doesn't know any lawyers.

120
00:13:44,859 --> 00:13:46,795
The federal court
tossed it into our lap.

121
00:13:48,096 --> 00:13:50,031
The Bar Committee took a vote.

122
00:13:50,064 --> 00:13:51,866
You're the unanimous choice.

123
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,501
It was important to us...

124
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,836
It's important
to our country, Jim,

125
00:13:54,869 --> 00:13:56,805
that this man is seen
as getting a fair shake.

126
00:13:56,838 --> 00:13:58,840
American justice
will be on trial.

127
00:13:58,873 --> 00:14:00,775
Well, of course,
when you put it that way,

128
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:02,777
it's an honor to be asked.

129
00:14:02,811 --> 00:14:04,712
But, Lynn,
I'm an insurance lawyer.

130
00:14:04,746 --> 00:14:06,681
I haven't done
criminal work in years.

131
00:14:06,714 --> 00:14:08,716
It's like riding a bike,
isn't it?

132
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,819
You distinguished yourself
at Nuremberg.

133
00:14:10,852 --> 00:14:12,554
I was on
the prosecution team.

134
00:14:12,587 --> 00:14:13,822
Not the point.

135
00:14:13,855 --> 00:14:15,215
You're no stranger
to criminal law.

136
00:14:15,957 --> 00:14:17,892
Jim, look at the situation.

137
00:14:17,926 --> 00:14:19,961
The man is publicly reviled.

138
00:14:19,994 --> 00:14:20,995
And I will be, too.

139
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:22,864
Yes, in more
ignorant quarters.

140
00:14:22,897 --> 00:14:24,732
But that's exactly why
this has to be done,

141
00:14:24,766 --> 00:14:26,835
and capably done.

142
00:14:26,868 --> 00:14:28,837
It can't look like
our justice system

143
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,030
tosses people
on the ash heap.

144
00:14:35,577 --> 00:14:37,846
Suppose I did,
what's the evidence look like?

145
00:14:39,113 --> 00:14:40,615
Pretty overwhelming.

146
00:14:41,115 --> 00:14:43,117
Great. Great.

147
00:14:43,151 --> 00:14:45,787
Everyone will hate me
but at least I'll lose.

148
00:14:47,956 --> 00:14:50,024
Well, what do
you think, Tom?

149
00:14:50,058 --> 00:14:52,727
The firm will suffer.
I have work here.

150
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,796
I think
it's a patriotic duty.

151
00:14:54,829 --> 00:14:56,798
It's an important mission.

152
00:14:56,831 --> 00:14:59,033
I told Lynn,
the firm can't say no,

153
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:01,135
and you'd have a tough time
saying no, too.

154
00:15:02,737 --> 00:15:05,607
I think you have to defend
the son of a bitch.

155
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,642
So, you're doing it?

156
00:15:07,675 --> 00:15:09,010
Doing what?

157
00:15:09,043 --> 00:15:12,046
Defending Abel,
the Soviet spy.

158
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,381
I may. I have to speak to...

159
00:15:13,414 --> 00:15:16,050
Wait, how do you know?
Did they post it on the bulletin board?

160
00:15:16,084 --> 00:15:18,152
No, I... I was
talking to Richard Earl...

161
00:15:18,186 --> 00:15:20,088
Look, if I do this,
I'm going to need your help.

162
00:15:23,658 --> 00:15:24,893
Can you work tonight?

163
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:28,001
Well, I have
a dinner date, sir.

164
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,902
It's Tuesday, right?
Yeah, no, I'm free, completely free.

165
00:15:33,935 --> 00:15:35,036
Thank you, sir.

166
00:15:39,073 --> 00:15:40,909
But it's also an honor.

167
00:15:40,942 --> 00:15:43,044
And the Bar Association
asked me

168
00:15:43,077 --> 00:15:44,846
because they want
to show that even a spy

169
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:46,648
gets a capable advocate.

170
00:15:46,681 --> 00:15:48,816
Well, maybe it's the kind of honor
we could do without.

171
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,250
Hey, honey,
what are you doing home?

172
00:15:51,653 --> 00:15:52,653
I got stood up.

173
00:15:53,721 --> 00:15:56,157
Well, that's despicable.

174
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,759
Who is this knot-head?

175
00:15:57,792 --> 00:15:58,960
I'd rather not say.

176
00:15:58,993 --> 00:16:01,129
Well, sit down.
We just started.

177
00:16:01,162 --> 00:16:02,330
People are scared.

178
00:16:02,363 --> 00:16:04,198
They're building
bomb shelters to protect themselves

179
00:16:04,232 --> 00:16:06,634
from people like this man.

180
00:16:06,668 --> 00:16:07,835
I go to the store,

181
00:16:07,869 --> 00:16:11,172
people are buying
canned food and potassium tablets.

182
00:16:11,205 --> 00:16:14,008
It's all about this man
and what he represents.

183
00:16:14,042 --> 00:16:16,110
He's a threat to all of us.
A traitor.

184
00:16:16,144 --> 00:16:17,946
Who's a traitor?
The Rosenbergs were traitors.

185
00:16:17,979 --> 00:16:18,880
Who were they?

186
00:16:18,913 --> 00:16:20,982
They gave atomic secrets
to the Russians.

187
00:16:21,015 --> 00:16:22,984
They were Americans.
They betrayed their country.

188
00:16:23,017 --> 00:16:25,086
You can't accuse Abel
of being a traitor.

189
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:26,654
He's not an American.

190
00:16:26,688 --> 00:16:28,056
Oh, listen to yourself.

191
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:29,724
You're defending him already.

192
00:16:29,757 --> 00:16:30,792
You're rehearsing it on me.

193
00:16:30,825 --> 00:16:32,827
You said you were
just thinking about taking it.

194
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,730
I am just thinking about it,
just very hard.

195
00:16:35,763 --> 00:16:38,700
Everyone deserves a defense.
Every person matters.

196
00:16:38,733 --> 00:16:40,034
Jim, what do we deserve?

197
00:16:40,068 --> 00:16:42,003
Do you know how
people will look at us?

198
00:16:42,036 --> 00:16:44,205
The family of a man
trying to free a traitor?

199
00:16:44,238 --> 00:16:46,140
He's not a traitor, Mary.
Yes, yes.

200
00:16:46,174 --> 00:16:47,709
Roger, get that! He's not a traitor...

201
00:16:47,742 --> 00:16:48,977
Why do I have to do
all the work?

202
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,812
Oh! You wait till we say grace.
I'm hungry!

203
00:16:50,845 --> 00:16:52,213
He's about the most unpopular
man in this country,

204
00:16:52,246 --> 00:16:53,848
and you're trying
to take second place!

205
00:16:53,881 --> 00:16:55,283
Yeah, and I'm third.

206
00:16:55,316 --> 00:16:57,285
Carol, you just dated the wrong guy.
I wanna eat.

207
00:16:57,318 --> 00:16:58,853
Mary, don't make
this an argument

208
00:16:58,886 --> 00:16:59,887
when we're not having
an argument.

209
00:16:59,921 --> 00:17:01,189
You're against him,
I'm for him?

210
00:17:01,222 --> 00:17:04,025
No, I'm not for him.
I'm not for the Russians spying on us.

211
00:17:04,058 --> 00:17:07,028
I'm for his right to have a defense
in a court of law,

212
00:17:07,061 --> 00:17:09,063
which is why they call it
a court of law.

213
00:17:09,097 --> 00:17:10,965
I didn't mean
to interrupt dinner.

214
00:17:10,999 --> 00:17:12,200
A court of law...
Hey, Doug.

215
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:16,904
Oh, no, not at all.
Hello, Doug.
Jim was just flailing.

216
00:17:16,938 --> 00:17:19,173
I'm not flailing.
Go ahead, Doug, you can join us for dinner.

217
00:17:19,207 --> 00:17:21,009
We're having
meatloaf tonight.

218
00:17:23,277 --> 00:17:25,813
So, you came over
to help Jim think about

219
00:17:25,847 --> 00:17:27,048
whether he's
taking the case?

220
00:17:27,081 --> 00:17:29,951
Oh, we're taking it!
It's exciting, isn't it?

221
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:39,794
Lord, we thank thee
for thy blessings

222
00:17:39,827 --> 00:17:41,229
we are about to receive.

223
00:17:41,262 --> 00:17:43,798
Thy bounty through Christ,
our Lord. Amen.

224
00:17:51,239 --> 00:17:53,341
Good morning, sir.
My name is Jim Donovan.

225
00:17:53,374 --> 00:17:55,343
These are my credentials.

226
00:17:55,376 --> 00:17:57,812
I am a partner in
Watters, Cowan and Donovan.

227
00:17:57,845 --> 00:18:01,215
I was admitted to
the New York Bar in 1941.

228
00:18:05,253 --> 00:18:09,123
You have been charged
with three counts and 19 overt acts.

229
00:18:09,157 --> 00:18:11,826
Conspiracy to transmit
United States defense

230
00:18:11,859 --> 00:18:13,361
and atomic secrets
to the Soviet Union,

231
00:18:13,394 --> 00:18:15,129
conspiracy to
gather secrets,

232
00:18:15,163 --> 00:18:17,298
and failing to register
as a foreign agent.

233
00:18:23,171 --> 00:18:25,339
Do many foreign
agents register?

234
00:18:30,378 --> 00:18:32,847
If you don't mind
my asking, sir,

235
00:18:34,148 --> 00:18:37,085
since your arrest,
where have you been?

236
00:18:40,822 --> 00:18:42,056
I couldn't say for certain.

237
00:18:44,425 --> 00:18:45,425
You don't know?

238
00:18:47,128 --> 00:18:48,996
They drove me to an airport

239
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,165
and put me on a plane,
took me off the plane.

240
00:18:53,301 --> 00:18:54,836
Somewhere hot.

241
00:18:56,037 --> 00:18:57,071
It's hot here.

242
00:18:57,105 --> 00:19:00,041
Hotter, very humid.

243
00:19:00,074 --> 00:19:02,009
They put me in a room.

244
00:19:03,945 --> 00:19:05,246
Were you beaten?

245
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,281
No.

246
00:19:07,315 --> 00:19:09,283
I was talked to.

247
00:19:09,317 --> 00:19:11,385
Offers were made.

248
00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:12,487
What do you mean?

249
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,023
Offers of employment,
to work for your government.

250
00:19:18,326 --> 00:19:20,962
I was told if I cooperated,

251
00:19:20,995 --> 00:19:23,164
no further charges
would be made against me.

252
00:19:24,465 --> 00:19:26,000
And I would be given money.

253
00:19:27,335 --> 00:19:28,436
Hmm.

254
00:19:28,469 --> 00:19:30,037
And you declined?

255
00:19:31,439 --> 00:19:33,908
As you see.

256
00:19:33,941 --> 00:19:36,310
Well, of course
I can't endorse that.

257
00:19:36,344 --> 00:19:38,279
I feel duty-bound
to urge you

258
00:19:38,312 --> 00:19:40,414
to cooperate with
the U.S. government.

259
00:19:40,448 --> 00:19:41,849
Well, I said no.

260
00:19:41,883 --> 00:19:45,086
Perhaps you could relay
to your friends at the CIA that I meant it.

261
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:47,121
No, no, no.

262
00:19:47,155 --> 00:19:49,090
I... I don't work
for the agency.

263
00:19:50,992 --> 00:19:53,060
I don't work
for the government.

264
00:19:53,094 --> 00:19:56,330
I am here to offer my services
as your legal counsel.

265
00:19:56,364 --> 00:19:59,200
If you accept them
as such,

266
00:20:00,368 --> 00:20:01,969
I work for you.

267
00:20:02,503 --> 00:20:04,438
If I accept you?

268
00:20:11,078 --> 00:20:13,047
Are you good at what you do?

269
00:20:14,515 --> 00:20:17,084
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm pretty good.

270
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,191
Have you represented
many accused spies?

271
00:20:26,127 --> 00:20:27,895
No, not yet.

272
00:20:29,363 --> 00:20:31,999
This will be a first
for the both of us.

273
00:20:35,536 --> 00:20:36,938
Yes.

274
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,008
All right.

275
00:20:41,042 --> 00:20:42,476
"All right"?
You accept?

276
00:20:45,112 --> 00:20:46,447
Yes, all right.

277
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,983
Good, okay.

278
00:20:49,016 --> 00:20:50,151
Let's start here.

279
00:20:50,184 --> 00:20:51,319
If you are firm
in your resolve

280
00:20:51,352 --> 00:20:52,954
not to cooperate
with the U.S. government...

281
00:20:52,987 --> 00:20:54,088
I am.

282
00:20:54,121 --> 00:20:55,523
Yeah.

283
00:20:55,556 --> 00:20:57,391
Then do not talk
to anybody else about your case,

284
00:20:57,425 --> 00:20:59,126
inside of government or out.

285
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,263
Except to me,
to the extent that you trust me.

286
00:21:02,296 --> 00:21:04,298
I have a mandate to serve you.
Nobody else does.

287
00:21:04,332 --> 00:21:06,100
Quite frankly,
everybody else has an interest

288
00:21:06,133 --> 00:21:07,573
in sending you
to the electric chair.

289
00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:09,269
All right.

290
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,242
You don't seem alarmed.

291
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,182
Would it help?

292
00:21:31,459 --> 00:21:35,529
I... I would like
materials to draw with.

293
00:21:35,563 --> 00:21:37,031
That's not possible.

294
00:21:38,065 --> 00:21:40,001
A pencil, a piece of paper.

295
00:21:40,034 --> 00:21:41,235
Cigarettes.

296
00:21:43,571 --> 00:21:45,206
Please?

297
00:21:52,613 --> 00:21:55,416
Mr. Donovan,
you have men like me

298
00:21:55,449 --> 00:21:58,019
doing the same
for your country.

299
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,489
If they were caught,

300
00:22:01,522 --> 00:22:04,425
I'm sure that you would
wish them to be treated well.

301
00:22:09,096 --> 00:22:10,364
What's your name?

302
00:22:10,398 --> 00:22:12,033
Francis Gary Powers.

303
00:22:14,235 --> 00:22:16,070
Rank, service?

304
00:22:16,103 --> 00:22:18,306
First Lieutenant,
United States Air Force.

305
00:22:20,374 --> 00:22:22,076
Do you have any association

306
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:24,111
with the Soviet Union,
Lieutenant Powers?

307
00:22:24,145 --> 00:22:25,346
Kidding?

308
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:26,547
Just answer the questions,
Lieutenant.

309
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,150
Yes, no,
or as simply as you can.

310
00:22:29,183 --> 00:22:31,352
Do you have any association
with the Soviet Union?

311
00:22:31,385 --> 00:22:33,087
Hell, no.

312
00:22:34,655 --> 00:22:36,090
Do you know
why you're here?

313
00:22:36,123 --> 00:22:37,291
Mmm-mmm.

314
00:22:38,225 --> 00:22:40,394
Is that a no?

315
00:22:40,428 --> 00:22:42,630
Yes. I mean...

316
00:22:42,663 --> 00:22:44,532
No, it's just "no."

317
00:22:44,565 --> 00:22:47,101
Yes, I have absolutely
no idea why I'm here.

318
00:22:47,134 --> 00:22:48,302
Eyes front, Lieutenant.

319
00:22:48,336 --> 00:22:49,470
Yes, sir.

320
00:23:07,221 --> 00:23:08,456
How'd you do in there, Gary?

321
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:13,194
Pretty good.
Think I got my name right.

322
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:16,163
You probably
outscored Shinn, then.

323
00:23:17,631 --> 00:23:19,066
Who's winning?

324
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,334
Uh, that would be me.

325
00:23:20,368 --> 00:23:22,303
Oh. Well, deal me in.

326
00:23:22,336 --> 00:23:24,538
So, these are
all mine, then.

327
00:23:24,572 --> 00:23:26,407
I told you boys
not to play with him.

328
00:23:53,434 --> 00:23:55,269
Okay, drivers,
here's the deal.

329
00:23:56,737 --> 00:23:58,606
You've been selected
for a mission

330
00:23:58,639 --> 00:24:00,174
which you are
not to discuss

331
00:24:00,207 --> 00:24:02,476
with anyone
outside of this room.

332
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,245
No one.

333
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:06,313
I don't care who you trust.

334
00:24:06,347 --> 00:24:08,315
Wife, mother, sweetheart.

335
00:24:08,349 --> 00:24:10,317
The good Lord
when you pray at night.

336
00:24:10,351 --> 00:24:12,286
You don't tell
any of them anything

337
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:14,121
of what
I'm about to tell you.

338
00:24:16,624 --> 00:24:19,360
Each of you drivers has
met certain qualifications.

339
00:24:20,227 --> 00:24:22,430
High level
security clearance.

340
00:24:22,463 --> 00:24:24,231
Exceptional pilot ratings

341
00:24:24,265 --> 00:24:26,233
in excess of
the required hours flight time

342
00:24:26,267 --> 00:24:28,202
in a single-seat aircraft.

343
00:24:28,235 --> 00:24:31,205
We are engaged in a war.

344
00:24:31,238 --> 00:24:33,474
This war does not, for the moment,
involve men-at-arms.

345
00:24:33,507 --> 00:24:35,376
It involves information.

346
00:24:35,409 --> 00:24:37,611
You will be
collecting information.

347
00:24:37,645 --> 00:24:40,481
You will be gathering
intelligence about the enemy.

348
00:24:40,514 --> 00:24:44,151
The intelligence you gather
could give us the upper hand

349
00:24:44,185 --> 00:24:46,720
in a full thermonuclear exchange
with the Soviet Union.

350
00:24:48,756 --> 00:24:50,191
Or it could prevent one.

351
00:24:51,525 --> 00:24:53,727
For public purposes,

352
00:24:53,761 --> 00:24:55,529
as far as your wife or mother

353
00:24:55,563 --> 00:24:57,531
or sweetheart
or the good Lord above,

354
00:24:57,565 --> 00:24:59,567
your mission does not exist.

355
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,436
If it does not exist,
you do not exist.

356
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:05,573
You cannot be shot down.
You cannot be captured.

357
00:25:12,313 --> 00:25:13,647
You work for the CIA now.

358
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,397
So, Jim, I heard your guy is
speaking with a phony accent.

359
00:25:31,499 --> 00:25:33,501
Does he keep that up
all the time?

360
00:25:33,534 --> 00:25:36,270
Actually, I'm pretty sure
that's just the way he talks.

361
00:25:36,303 --> 00:25:38,405
He's got the Russian name
but a British passport.

362
00:25:38,439 --> 00:25:41,342
Well, I doubt
that that's genuine.

363
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:43,644
So, Jim, where are we?
I see here...

364
00:25:43,677 --> 00:25:46,280
Yes, uh, Judge, you see,

365
00:25:46,313 --> 00:25:50,684
I just don't think that three weeks
is going to do it, here.

366
00:25:50,718 --> 00:25:52,686
We... We got a massive amount
of evidence, as you know.

367
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,787
You wanna postpone?

368
00:25:53,821 --> 00:25:54,989
Six weeks.

369
00:25:55,022 --> 00:25:58,492
I mean, there's just myself
and my associate, basically.

370
00:25:58,526 --> 00:25:59,727
Jim, is this serious?

371
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,761
Sir?

372
00:26:03,831 --> 00:26:05,599
Is this serious?

373
00:26:05,633 --> 00:26:07,268
Yes. Yes, indeed, it is.

374
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:08,702
You can see
in the filing...

375
00:26:08,736 --> 00:26:11,572
Jim, this man is a Soviet spy.

376
00:26:11,605 --> 00:26:14,275
Allegedly.
Come on, Counselor!

377
00:26:15,843 --> 00:26:17,344
Your Honor.

378
00:26:17,378 --> 00:26:18,779
Of course, I salute you.

379
00:26:18,812 --> 00:26:21,348
We all salute you for
taking on a thankless task.

380
00:26:21,382 --> 00:26:23,250
This man has to have
due process.

381
00:26:23,284 --> 00:26:24,552
But let's not kid each other.

382
00:26:25,753 --> 00:26:28,589
He'll receive
a capable defense.

383
00:26:28,622 --> 00:26:32,326
And, God willing,
he'll be convicted.

384
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,727
Come on, Counselor.

385
00:26:33,761 --> 00:26:35,296
Let's not play games
with this.

386
00:26:35,329 --> 00:26:37,431
Not in my courtroom.

387
00:26:37,464 --> 00:26:39,466
We have a date

388
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,335
and we're going to trial.

389
00:26:50,511 --> 00:26:52,479
Taxi!

390
00:26:52,513 --> 00:26:54,281
Taxi!

391
00:26:54,315 --> 00:26:57,284
I see your light on!
Son of a bitch.

392
00:26:58,652 --> 00:27:01,355
Can't wait to get back
to Manhattan.

393
00:27:01,388 --> 00:27:02,590
His light was on, right?

394
00:27:03,724 --> 00:27:05,559
Son of a bitch.

395
00:27:52,573 --> 00:27:54,408
Against their
level of comfort.

396
00:27:54,441 --> 00:27:55,509
The statute hasn't changed.

397
00:27:55,542 --> 00:27:56,944
Oh, excuse me, sir.

398
00:27:56,977 --> 00:27:58,646
Pardon me. Sorry. Oh!

399
00:28:29,977 --> 00:28:31,645
Mr. Donovan.

400
00:28:33,981 --> 00:28:35,649
What?

401
00:28:38,986 --> 00:28:40,587
What?

402
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,868
CIA.

403
00:28:54,902 --> 00:28:55,902
Yeah.

404
00:28:56,804 --> 00:28:57,971
I just wanted to chat.

405
00:29:02,443 --> 00:29:03,777
How's the case going?

406
00:29:03,811 --> 00:29:06,580
Case is going great.
Couldn't be better.

407
00:29:06,613 --> 00:29:07,681
Mmm-hmm.

408
00:29:08,582 --> 00:29:09,717
Has your guy talked?

409
00:29:14,054 --> 00:29:16,690
Excuse me.

410
00:29:16,724 --> 00:29:19,460
You met him. Has he talked?
Has he said anything yet?

411
00:29:21,729 --> 00:29:23,564
We're not having
this conversation.

412
00:29:23,597 --> 00:29:25,699
No, of course not.

413
00:29:25,733 --> 00:29:27,901
No, I mean,
we really are not having it.

414
00:29:27,935 --> 00:29:31,638
You're asking me to violate
attorney-client privilege.

415
00:29:31,672 --> 00:29:32,940
Oh, come on, Counselor.

416
00:29:32,973 --> 00:29:33,941
You know,
I wish people like you

417
00:29:33,974 --> 00:29:35,042
would quit saying
"Oh, come on, Counselor."

418
00:29:35,075 --> 00:29:36,944
I didn't like it the first
time it happened today.

419
00:29:36,977 --> 00:29:38,779
A judge said it to me twice.

420
00:29:38,812 --> 00:29:40,814
And the more I hear it,
the more I don't like it.

421
00:29:44,084 --> 00:29:46,687
Okay, well, listen,
I understand attorney-client privilege.

422
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,923
I understand
all the legal gamesmanship.

423
00:29:49,957 --> 00:29:52,659
And I understand
that's how you make a living.

424
00:29:52,693 --> 00:29:55,562
But I'm talking to you
about something else.

425
00:29:57,564 --> 00:29:59,666
The security
of your country.

426
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,836
And I'm sorry
if the way I put it offends you.

427
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:06,540
But we need to know
what Abel is telling you.

428
00:30:06,573 --> 00:30:08,642
You understand me, Donovan?

429
00:30:08,675 --> 00:30:10,711
We need to know.

430
00:30:10,744 --> 00:30:12,513
Don't go "Boy Scout" on me.

431
00:30:13,981 --> 00:30:15,783
We don't have
a rule book, here.

432
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:19,086
You're Agent Hoffman, yeah?

433
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:20,988
Yeah.

434
00:30:21,021 --> 00:30:23,090
German extraction.

435
00:30:23,123 --> 00:30:24,558
Yeah, so?

436
00:30:24,591 --> 00:30:26,493
My name's Donovan. Irish.

437
00:30:26,527 --> 00:30:28,929
Both sides,
mother and father.

438
00:30:28,962 --> 00:30:32,099
I'm Irish, you're German.

439
00:30:32,132 --> 00:30:34,968
But what makes us
both Americans?

440
00:30:35,002 --> 00:30:37,070
Just one thing.

441
00:30:37,104 --> 00:30:38,739
One, one, one.

442
00:30:39,873 --> 00:30:40,873
The rule book.

443
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:43,777
We call it the Constitution

444
00:30:43,811 --> 00:30:45,779
and we agree to the rules,

445
00:30:45,813 --> 00:30:47,581
and that's what
makes us Americans.

446
00:30:47,614 --> 00:30:48,749
It's all that
makes us Americans

447
00:30:48,782 --> 00:30:49,850
so don't tell me
there's no rule book,

448
00:30:49,883 --> 00:30:52,486
and don't nod at me like that,
you son of a bitch.

449
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,032
Do we need to
worry about you?

450
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:09,503
Not if I'm left alone
to do my job.

451
00:31:24,585 --> 00:31:25,819
From this moment forward

452
00:31:25,853 --> 00:31:28,589
you will not refer to the U-2
as a spy plane

453
00:31:28,622 --> 00:31:30,624
or reconnaissance aircraft.

454
00:31:30,657 --> 00:31:32,893
You will refer to it
as <i>"The Article."</i>

455
00:31:32,926 --> 00:31:36,063
<i>The Article</i>
has an 80-foot wingspan.

456
00:31:36,096 --> 00:31:41,602
It's powered by a single Pratt and Whitney
J57 P-37 engine.

457
00:31:41,635 --> 00:31:44,004
10,000 pounds of thrust

458
00:31:44,037 --> 00:31:48,075
and a maximum speed
of 430 miles an hour.

459
00:31:48,108 --> 00:31:49,843
She may not be quick,

460
00:31:49,877 --> 00:31:52,779
but at your cruising altitude
of 70,000 feet,

461
00:31:52,813 --> 00:31:54,615
nothing will
come close to you.

462
00:31:54,648 --> 00:31:55,782
70,000?

463
00:31:55,816 --> 00:31:58,785
The idea is the enemy doesn't
even know you're there.

464
00:31:58,819 --> 00:32:00,687
It looks kind of flimsy.

465
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:07,694
Every extra pound of weight
costs a foot in altitude,

466
00:32:07,728 --> 00:32:09,563
and we need
to accommodate the cameras.

467
00:32:11,698 --> 00:32:15,669
That's a 4,500-millimeter
lens, times three.

468
00:32:15,702 --> 00:32:18,005
A pin-sharp
panoramic camera

469
00:32:18,038 --> 00:32:22,676
four times as powerful as any aerial
reconnaissance cameras we've ever used.

470
00:32:22,709 --> 00:32:25,913
You're gonna be taking
pictures, lots of pictures.

471
00:32:25,946 --> 00:32:28,215
At 70,000 feet,
<i>The Article</i> can photograph

472
00:32:28,248 --> 00:32:32,185
2,000 square miles
of territory in one pass.

473
00:32:32,219 --> 00:32:33,954
Now, drivers,

474
00:32:33,987 --> 00:32:37,124
give Agent Sumner
your undivided attention.

475
00:32:37,157 --> 00:32:41,228
The items you will need
on your mission are over here.

476
00:32:41,261 --> 00:32:43,964
B camera,
Revere 8 model 40 magazine,

477
00:32:43,997 --> 00:32:46,833
Keystone Capri K-25, silver.

478
00:32:46,867 --> 00:32:48,835
Hollow-handle shaving brush.

479
00:32:48,869 --> 00:32:52,005
Complete set of cipher tables
on edible silver foil.

480
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:53,874
Specialist photographic
equipment.

481
00:32:56,076 --> 00:32:58,779
Yeah, we, uh...
We get the idea. Thank you.

482
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:14,027
Uh, excuse me,
Agent, uh, Bosco. "Blasco."

483
00:33:14,061 --> 00:33:15,896
Sir.

484
00:33:15,929 --> 00:33:20,934
There seems to be
a subsection to this list here.

485
00:33:20,968 --> 00:33:22,970
Well, most of this stuff
came from his studio,

486
00:33:23,003 --> 00:33:25,163
but the rest is from the
hotel room he was holed up in.

487
00:33:25,272 --> 00:33:26,807
Where we found him.

488
00:33:28,141 --> 00:33:30,243
The hotel room you searched?

489
00:33:30,277 --> 00:33:32,045
Well, yeah.

490
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:34,147
Can I see the warrant?

491
00:33:34,181 --> 00:33:35,782
The what?

492
00:33:37,184 --> 00:33:39,753
Yeah, explain this to me.
There was a warrant.

493
00:33:39,786 --> 00:33:41,121
There was a warrant.

494
00:33:41,154 --> 00:33:43,223
A civil detention writ
for the arrest of an alien,

495
00:33:43,256 --> 00:33:45,125
but there was
no search warrant

496
00:33:45,158 --> 00:33:46,960
for suspicion
of criminal activity.

497
00:33:46,994 --> 00:33:48,228
So, the search
and the evidence

498
00:33:48,261 --> 00:33:49,997
that is
the fruit of that search,

499
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:52,132
that's all tainted
and should not be admitted.

500
00:33:52,165 --> 00:33:54,901
What protections is he due,
Your Honor? The man is not...

501
00:33:54,935 --> 00:33:57,771
The man is what?
He's Rudolf Ivanovich Abel.

502
00:33:57,804 --> 00:33:59,706
He is a Soviet citizen.

503
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,008
He's not an American.

504
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:05,178
1886,
<i>Yick Wo v. Hopkins.</i>

505
00:34:05,212 --> 00:34:08,315
The court held that even aliens,
in that case Chinese immigrants,

506
00:34:08,348 --> 00:34:11,718
could not be held to answer for a crime
without due process of law,

507
00:34:11,752 --> 00:34:13,912
including any alien that entered
the country illegally.

508
00:34:14,187 --> 00:34:15,789
The Department of Justice

509
00:34:15,822 --> 00:34:19,059
has its first allegiance
to the United States.

510
00:34:19,092 --> 00:34:21,194
I don't see how an alien,
if he's here illegally,

511
00:34:21,228 --> 00:34:24,097
how he suffered
deprivation of rights.

512
00:34:24,131 --> 00:34:25,932
Rights as what?

513
00:34:25,966 --> 00:34:27,801
An American?

514
00:34:27,834 --> 00:34:30,971
Rights as what, Counselor?

515
00:34:31,004 --> 00:34:32,806
We're in a battle
for civilization.

516
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:36,043
This Russian spy came here
to threaten our way of life.

517
00:34:36,076 --> 00:34:38,145
Now, I have a courtroom
of people waiting.

518
00:34:38,178 --> 00:34:40,180
Get out there,
sit beside the Russian.

519
00:34:40,213 --> 00:34:42,349
Let's get this
over and done with.

520
00:34:42,382 --> 00:34:44,818
And your motion is denied.

521
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,756
He should take some
insurance out on himself.

522
00:34:50,257 --> 00:34:51,358
How did we do?

523
00:34:51,391 --> 00:34:52,826
In there?

524
00:34:54,161 --> 00:34:55,228
Uh...

525
00:34:55,262 --> 00:34:57,230
Not too good.

526
00:34:57,264 --> 00:34:59,266
Apparently, you're not
an American citizen.

527
00:34:59,299 --> 00:35:01,234
That's true.

528
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:03,036
And according
to your boss,

529
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,738
you're not
a Soviet citizen either.

530
00:35:06,006 --> 00:35:08,075
Well, the boss
isn't always right

531
00:35:09,876 --> 00:35:11,311
but he's always the boss.

532
00:35:16,316 --> 00:35:17,316
Do you never worry?

533
00:35:18,418 --> 00:35:20,287
Would it help?

534
00:35:27,427 --> 00:35:28,427
All rise.

535
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:35,035
"I pledge allegiance
to the Flag

536
00:35:35,068 --> 00:35:38,138
"of the United States
of America,

537
00:35:38,171 --> 00:35:42,142
"and to the Republic
for which it stands,

538
00:35:42,175 --> 00:35:47,047
"one Nation under God,
indivisible,

539
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,349
"with liberty and justice
for all."

540
00:35:53,386 --> 00:35:55,188
<i>First,
you have to know what happens</i>

541
00:35:55,222 --> 00:35:57,257
<i>when an atomic bomb explodes.</i>

542
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,096
<i>There is a bright flash,
brighter than the sun.</i>

543
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:06,266
<i>It can smash in buildings,
break windows all over town.</i>

544
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:12,339
<i>But if you duck and cover
like Bert,</i>

545
00:36:12,372 --> 00:36:14,307
<i>you will be much safer.</i>

546
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:16,443
<i>There are
two kinds of attack,</i>

547
00:36:16,476 --> 00:36:18,912
<i>with warning
and without any warning.</i>

548
00:36:21,281 --> 00:36:22,281
Mmm.

549
00:36:23,984 --> 00:36:25,218
What's going on in here?

550
00:36:25,252 --> 00:36:27,120
Okay, Dad,
this is really important.

551
00:36:27,154 --> 00:36:29,189
When the war begins,
the first thing they do

552
00:36:29,222 --> 00:36:31,925
is cut off all the water
and all the electricity.

553
00:36:31,958 --> 00:36:34,060
So the first thing we should do
is keep this filled,

554
00:36:34,094 --> 00:36:35,428
use the shower in your room,

555
00:36:35,462 --> 00:36:37,964
use the sink downstairs,
the garden hose outside...

556
00:36:37,998 --> 00:36:40,066
Those are good ideas.

557
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,068
But, Roger, I don't see this

558
00:36:42,102 --> 00:36:43,982
as being something
you ever have to worry about.

559
00:36:45,405 --> 00:36:46,673
Yeah, but when
you hear the sirens,

560
00:36:46,706 --> 00:36:49,910
there may not be enough time
to fill the tub and the sinks.

561
00:36:50,944 --> 00:36:52,379
Not gonna be any sirens...

562
00:36:54,014 --> 00:36:55,348
What is this?

563
00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:56,416
When the bomb comes,

564
00:36:56,449 --> 00:36:59,286
the Reds will aim
for the Empire State Building.

565
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:02,122
But the bomb goes off
at 10,000 feet up.

566
00:37:02,155 --> 00:37:04,090
In <i>Life</i> magazine,
it's called an airburst,

567
00:37:04,124 --> 00:37:06,126
and if the bomb
is 50 megatons,

568
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:09,329
the blast wave goes
out and out and out

569
00:37:09,362 --> 00:37:11,898
and melts everything
from here to here.

570
00:37:11,932 --> 00:37:13,166
Including where we live.
Here.

571
00:37:14,434 --> 00:37:16,102
Yeah, right there.

572
00:37:16,136 --> 00:37:17,237
But, you know, Roger,

573
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:19,906
no one is dropping
atomic bombs on us.

574
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,308
But the Russians want to.

575
00:37:21,341 --> 00:37:23,243
You know that Russian guy
you're defending?

576
00:37:23,276 --> 00:37:24,344
He's here
to get things ready

577
00:37:24,377 --> 00:37:26,179
for the guys
who drop the bombs.

578
00:37:26,213 --> 00:37:28,281
No, no, he's not...
Not here for that.

579
00:37:28,315 --> 00:37:29,916
He's not even Russian.

580
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:31,985
He was born, we think,
in Northern England.

581
00:37:32,018 --> 00:37:33,258
Yeah, but he's
a spy for Russia.

582
00:37:34,521 --> 00:37:36,523
I don't even understand
what you're doing.

583
00:37:36,556 --> 00:37:38,992
You're not a Communist,
so why are you defending one?

584
00:37:39,025 --> 00:37:40,994
Well, because it's my job.

585
00:37:41,027 --> 00:37:43,063
It never used to be.

586
00:38:12,592 --> 00:38:15,028
<i>- In the case of the
- United States of America</i>

587
00:38:15,061 --> 00:38:17,264
versus Rudolf Abel,

588
00:38:17,297 --> 00:38:19,966
as to the first count
in the indictment,

589
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,068
how do you
find the defendant?

590
00:38:22,102 --> 00:38:24,337
Guilty or not guilty?

591
00:38:24,371 --> 00:38:25,371
Guilty.

592
00:38:27,007 --> 00:38:28,241
As to the second count?

593
00:38:28,575 --> 00:38:30,477
Guilty.

594
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:32,579
As to the third count?

595
00:38:32,612 --> 00:38:33,847
Guilty.

596
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,249
Your Honor, I make a motion
to set aside these guilty verdicts

597
00:38:36,283 --> 00:38:38,018
against the weight
of evidence.

598
00:38:38,051 --> 00:38:39,552
Denied.

599
00:38:39,586 --> 00:38:41,454
The jury is discharged.

600
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:43,523
Thank you all.

601
00:38:43,556 --> 00:38:45,458
I would like to add that,
if I were one of you,

602
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:47,394
I would've reached
the same verdict.

603
00:38:49,095 --> 00:38:51,564
Sentencing will be

604
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:55,035
<i>November 15.</i>

605
00:39:03,543 --> 00:39:06,112
The death sentence is not
a foregone conclusion.

606
00:39:06,146 --> 00:39:07,147
Don't worry.

607
00:39:08,281 --> 00:39:10,450
I'm not afraid to die,
Mr. Donovan.

608
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,322
Although

609
00:39:15,355 --> 00:39:17,257
it wouldn't be
my first choice.

610
00:39:21,361 --> 00:39:23,596
You left this behind.

611
00:39:25,265 --> 00:39:26,266
Oh, thank you.

612
00:39:29,135 --> 00:39:30,503
Oh, thank you very much!

613
00:39:50,657 --> 00:39:53,293
You've never asked me
if the charges were true.

614
00:39:56,096 --> 00:39:59,032
If I am indeed a spy.

615
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:02,669
This is how we do it.

616
00:40:02,702 --> 00:40:05,071
The case against you matters.

617
00:40:05,105 --> 00:40:06,473
Making them prove it matters.

618
00:40:06,506 --> 00:40:08,408
The fiction is...

619
00:40:08,441 --> 00:40:10,410
Whether you did it or not
doesn't matter.

620
00:40:10,443 --> 00:40:13,413
The state has to prove it,
that you're a spy.

621
00:40:13,446 --> 00:40:15,148
So you're not curious?

622
00:40:15,582 --> 00:40:17,150
No, not really.

623
00:40:17,183 --> 00:40:19,686
I always assumed
you were an artist.

624
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:21,654
My wife, she's the artist.

625
00:40:21,688 --> 00:40:24,290
She's a musician

626
00:40:24,324 --> 00:40:28,128
in the Children's Orchestra
of Moscow.

627
00:40:28,161 --> 00:40:29,496
What instrument?

628
00:40:29,529 --> 00:40:31,398
The harp.

629
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:32,431
Oh.

630
00:40:33,466 --> 00:40:35,168
Then, she's an angel.

631
00:40:45,478 --> 00:40:48,214
Standing there like that,
you remind me of a man

632
00:40:48,248 --> 00:40:50,483
who used to come
to our house when I was young.

633
00:40:51,751 --> 00:40:55,255
My father used to say,
"Watch this man."

634
00:40:56,423 --> 00:40:59,692
So I did,
every time he came.

635
00:40:59,726 --> 00:41:02,695
And never once

636
00:41:02,729 --> 00:41:05,565
did he do
anything remarkable.

637
00:41:07,767 --> 00:41:10,136
And I remind you of him?

638
00:41:13,473 --> 00:41:17,377
This one time, I was
about the age of your son.

639
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:20,513
Our house was overrun
by partisan border guards.

640
00:41:24,317 --> 00:41:26,619
Dozens of them.

641
00:41:26,653 --> 00:41:28,688
My father was beaten,
my mother was beaten,

642
00:41:28,721 --> 00:41:32,125
and this man,
my father's friend, he was beaten.

643
00:41:33,793 --> 00:41:35,728
And I watched this man.

644
00:41:39,232 --> 00:41:40,600
Every time they hit him

645
00:41:42,735 --> 00:41:44,437
he stood back up again.

646
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:48,208
So they hit him harder.

647
00:41:50,477 --> 00:41:52,545
Still,
he got back to his feet.

648
00:41:56,249 --> 00:41:58,485
I think because of this
they stopped the beating.

649
00:41:58,518 --> 00:42:00,220
They let him live.

650
00:42:08,428 --> 00:42:10,463
I remember them saying it.

651
00:42:18,304 --> 00:42:20,373
It sort of means, like, uh,

652
00:42:22,709 --> 00:42:24,177
"standing man."

653
00:42:27,814 --> 00:42:28,814
Standing man.

654
00:42:40,693 --> 00:42:43,296
Hello, Jim!
Millie, you're a vision.

655
00:42:43,329 --> 00:42:45,698
Mortie's busy
getting kitted out.

656
00:42:45,732 --> 00:42:47,233
But come on in.

657
00:42:48,735 --> 00:42:51,404
Scotch, Jim?
Oh, yes, please. Thank you.

658
00:42:51,437 --> 00:42:53,273
Uh, just a drop of water.

659
00:42:54,274 --> 00:42:55,542
Your Honor.

660
00:42:55,575 --> 00:42:58,444
Hello, Jim!
Just going out.

661
00:42:58,478 --> 00:43:00,446
Got a few minutes though.

662
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,449
March of Dimes thing.
Millie is active.

663
00:43:04,884 --> 00:43:06,653
Well, thank you
for seeing me.

664
00:43:06,686 --> 00:43:10,723
I just wanted to give you
my two cents on the sentencing.

665
00:43:10,757 --> 00:43:13,860
And I thought maybe
I should pester you at home

666
00:43:13,893 --> 00:43:16,863
as not all of my points
are narrowly legal.

667
00:43:16,896 --> 00:43:19,666
Yeah, well,
it's that kind of case.

668
00:43:19,699 --> 00:43:21,734
I hope I wasn't too scratchy
during the trial

669
00:43:21,768 --> 00:43:24,604
but it's exactly
what you say.

670
00:43:24,637 --> 00:43:26,573
Nothing about this
is narrowly legal.

671
00:43:28,374 --> 00:43:29,509
There are bigger issues.

672
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:32,579
Bigger issues!

673
00:43:34,914 --> 00:43:36,683
Thank you, thank you.

674
00:43:36,716 --> 00:43:37,717
Uh...

675
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:41,487
Sir...

676
00:43:41,521 --> 00:43:43,523
I think it could be
considered

677
00:43:43,556 --> 00:43:46,326
in the best interests
of the United States

678
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:49,295
that Abel remain alive.

679
00:43:49,796 --> 00:43:51,598
Why?

680
00:43:51,631 --> 00:43:53,366
I'm not saying
I've made up my mind

681
00:43:53,399 --> 00:43:54,534
but if he was
gonna cooperate,

682
00:43:54,567 --> 00:43:56,736
work with the government,
he would've done it already.

683
00:43:56,769 --> 00:43:57,870
- True, but the issue here...
- You can't...

684
00:43:57,904 --> 00:43:59,606
Excuse me.

685
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:07,513
You can't say it's in the best interest
of the United States

686
00:44:07,547 --> 00:44:11,517
that he spend
the rest of his days in a prison cell.

687
00:44:11,551 --> 00:44:13,620
How is this
the national interest?

688
00:44:13,653 --> 00:44:15,788
Not the incarceration
itself, sir.

689
00:44:17,457 --> 00:44:20,526
It is possible that,
in the foreseeable future,

690
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,795
an American
of equivalent rank

691
00:44:22,829 --> 00:44:25,565
might be captured
by Soviet Russia.

692
00:44:25,598 --> 00:44:27,834
We might want to have
someone to trade.

693
00:44:27,867 --> 00:44:29,535
Wow.

694
00:44:29,569 --> 00:44:31,738
That sounds like
spinning what-ifs.

695
00:44:31,771 --> 00:44:33,673
You could do that
till the cows come home.

696
00:44:33,706 --> 00:44:36,643
It's my business, what-ifs.
I'm in insurance.

697
00:44:36,676 --> 00:44:38,945
And there's nothing
implausible about this one.

698
00:44:38,978 --> 00:44:42,382
It's entirely in the realm
of what could happen.

699
00:44:42,415 --> 00:44:45,785
It's the kind of probability that
people buy insurance for.

700
00:44:45,818 --> 00:44:49,756
If we send this guy to his death,
we leave ourselves wide open.

701
00:44:49,789 --> 00:44:52,558
No policy
in our back pocket

702
00:44:52,592 --> 00:44:54,394
for the day the storm comes.

703
00:44:56,596 --> 00:44:58,831
Nice speech.

704
00:44:58,865 --> 00:45:04,504
Sir, there is also
the humanitarian argument.

705
00:45:04,537 --> 00:45:07,607
Should he die for doing the job
they sent him to do?

706
00:45:09,742 --> 00:45:10,877
All right, Counselor.

707
00:45:13,613 --> 00:45:14,647
I gotta run.

708
00:45:18,584 --> 00:45:19,752
Good seeing you, Jim.

709
00:45:23,956 --> 00:45:25,425
I'll walk you out.

710
00:45:28,895 --> 00:45:29,895
All rise.

711
00:45:31,631 --> 00:45:32,932
The United States
District Court

712
00:45:32,965 --> 00:45:35,635
for the Eastern District
of New York is now in session.

713
00:45:35,668 --> 00:45:37,737
The honorable
Mortimer Byers presiding.

714
00:45:42,442 --> 00:45:43,776
Be seated.

715
00:45:55,688 --> 00:45:57,490
The defendant
will please rise.

716
00:46:12,038 --> 00:46:13,773
In the measured judgment
of this court

717
00:46:13,806 --> 00:46:15,041
the following sentence,

718
00:46:15,074 --> 00:46:17,577
based upon the jury's
verdict of guilty

719
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:19,912
as to each count
of the indictment,

720
00:46:19,946 --> 00:46:24,751
is believed to meet the test
which has been stated.

721
00:46:24,784 --> 00:46:27,687
Pursuant to the verdict
of guilty as to all counts,

722
00:46:30,022 --> 00:46:31,924
the defendant is committed
to the custody

723
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:34,026
of the Attorney General
of the United States

724
00:46:36,062 --> 00:46:38,564
for imprisonment
in a federal institution

725
00:46:38,598 --> 00:46:42,034
to be selected by him
for a period of 30 years.

726
00:46:43,169 --> 00:46:45,538
Marshals, you may take
the defendant into custody.

727
00:46:45,571 --> 00:46:46,672
No... No electrocution?

728
00:46:46,706 --> 00:46:48,074
No. No, no.

729
00:46:48,107 --> 00:46:49,842
Why aren't we hanging him?

730
00:46:49,876 --> 00:46:51,077
In the name of God,
why aren't we hanging him?

731
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:53,012
Sit down, sir!

732
00:46:53,045 --> 00:46:56,749
He's a spy!
He's killing us with his lies!

733
00:46:56,783 --> 00:46:58,518
In the name of God,
why aren't we hanging him?

734
00:46:58,551 --> 00:46:59,552
That's right!

735
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,855
He's a spy!

736
00:47:07,059 --> 00:47:08,961
Mr. Donovan! Mr. Donovan!

737
00:47:08,995 --> 00:47:11,964
Just one question.
Just one question, sir.

738
00:47:19,005 --> 00:47:20,773
My hat! My hat! My hat!

739
00:47:22,875 --> 00:47:24,544
Nobody here has a comment.

740
00:47:24,577 --> 00:47:26,112
Mr. and Mrs. Donovan
are not answering questions.

741
00:47:26,145 --> 00:47:27,547
How do you feel now that

742
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:28,748
this national nightmare
is over?

743
00:47:28,781 --> 00:47:30,082
Mr. Donovan, are
you happy with the verdict?

744
00:47:30,116 --> 00:47:33,719
We're... We're in
firm ground on, uh, for a case on appeal.

745
00:47:33,753 --> 00:47:34,993
Appeal?
Appeal, yes.

746
00:47:49,168 --> 00:47:51,003
Jim, you did a great job.

747
00:47:51,037 --> 00:47:53,806
You fulfilled your mandate
and then some.

748
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,842
But the man is a spy.

749
00:47:55,875 --> 00:47:58,578
The verdict is correct
and there's no reason to appeal it.

750
00:47:58,611 --> 00:48:00,546
There's ample
procedural reason.

751
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:01,647
We know the search
is tainted.

752
00:48:01,681 --> 00:48:02,849
And Fourth Amendment issues

753
00:48:02,882 --> 00:48:04,884
will always weigh more heavily
in an appellate forum.

754
00:48:04,917 --> 00:48:06,619
We've got a good shot.

755
00:48:06,652 --> 00:48:09,622
What the goddamn hell
are you talking about?

756
00:48:09,655 --> 00:48:12,859
We were supposed to show
he had a capable defense, which we did.

757
00:48:12,892 --> 00:48:15,161
Why are you citing
the goddamn Constitution at me?

758
00:48:15,194 --> 00:48:16,896
Tom, if you
look me in the eye

759
00:48:16,929 --> 00:48:18,965
and tell me
we don't have grounds

760
00:48:18,998 --> 00:48:19,999
for an appeal,
I'll drop it right now.

761
00:48:20,032 --> 00:48:22,168
I'm not saying that.
You know what I'm saying.

762
00:48:22,201 --> 00:48:24,637
Tom is saying there's
a cost to these things.

763
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:26,172
That's right.

764
00:48:26,205 --> 00:48:28,841
A cost to both
your family and your firm.

765
00:49:03,843 --> 00:49:06,679
I've missed music.

766
00:49:06,712 --> 00:49:09,048
They checked the radio to make
sure there was no transmitter in it.

767
00:49:09,081 --> 00:49:10,950
I'm sure they did.

768
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:14,987
Shostakovich. Mmm.

769
00:49:17,089 --> 00:49:19,692
That's a very great artist,
Shostakovich.

770
00:49:35,174 --> 00:49:36,742
Uh, I think

771
00:49:38,144 --> 00:49:42,114
our strongest grounds
for reversal

772
00:49:42,148 --> 00:49:43,148
are constitutional.

773
00:49:46,285 --> 00:49:50,022
Our best chance is if the Supreme Court
agrees to review our case.

774
00:49:55,695 --> 00:49:56,896
Jim...

775
00:50:03,803 --> 00:50:04,937
You should be careful.

776
00:50:10,776 --> 00:50:11,911
Careful.

They're cowards.
They're gone.

799
00:51:09,869 --> 00:51:12,238
We have detectives
canvassing the neighborhood.

800
00:51:12,271 --> 00:51:14,173
Maybe we'll find
a description of the car

801
00:51:14,206 --> 00:51:15,975
but I don't think
it's very likely.

802
00:51:16,008 --> 00:51:17,910
We're gonna
need protection.

803
00:51:17,943 --> 00:51:20,312
Oh, I have instructions
to leave two cars here.

804
00:51:20,346 --> 00:51:21,213
It'll be pretty obvious

805
00:51:21,247 --> 00:51:22,248
that this is a secure...
For how long?

806
00:51:22,281 --> 00:51:24,784
I have to be in Washington
later on this week.

807
00:51:24,817 --> 00:51:26,185
What are you doing?

808
00:51:26,218 --> 00:51:27,353
What are you doing
to your family?

809
00:51:27,386 --> 00:51:29,055
Pardon me, Officer?

810
00:51:29,088 --> 00:51:30,222
You're still
defending this guy?

811
00:51:30,256 --> 00:51:30,990
I mean, what are you
fighting for him for?

812
00:51:31,023 --> 00:51:33,092
Okay, knock that off,
Officer.

813
00:51:33,125 --> 00:51:34,360
I'll knock off nothing.

814
00:51:34,393 --> 00:51:36,028
I was in the third wave
at Omaha Beach.

815
00:51:36,062 --> 00:51:37,163
Hey, I did my time
in the service.

816
00:51:37,196 --> 00:51:39,098
I was fighting these guys,
and you're defending them?

817
00:51:39,131 --> 00:51:41,834
Why don't you just
do your job as an officer of the law?

818
00:51:41,867 --> 00:51:43,369
Okay, I'm sorry.
Let's go outside. Come on.

819
00:51:43,402 --> 00:51:44,937
You know what?
Just forget him.

820
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:46,238
What am I not getting here?

821
00:51:46,272 --> 00:51:50,242
Outside, Officer. I'm sorry.

822
00:51:50,276 --> 00:51:53,079
Defending a commie spy. Jeez!

823
00:52:10,396 --> 00:52:12,932
Do you feel
that you deserve this, sir?

824
00:52:35,187 --> 00:52:36,355
Should it become necessary

825
00:52:36,388 --> 00:52:39,425
to abandon the aircraft
over Soviet territory,

826
00:52:39,458 --> 00:52:42,027
then there's a two-and-a-half pound
explosive charge

827
00:52:42,061 --> 00:52:44,296
contained within
the fuselage.

828
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:47,299
Now, first,
you activate the circuits.

829
00:52:49,368 --> 00:52:52,238
But to start
the 70-second timer,

830
00:52:52,271 --> 00:52:55,174
you need to flip the switch
marked "Destruct."

831
00:52:58,144 --> 00:53:02,281
It is imperative that these
flights remain a secret

832
00:53:02,314 --> 00:53:05,851
and this equipment
does not fall into enemy hands.

833
00:53:05,885 --> 00:53:08,020
What about us?

834
00:53:08,053 --> 00:53:10,222
I don't know if you're kidding,
Lieutenant Powers.

835
00:53:10,256 --> 00:53:11,924
I'm not.

836
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,461
What you know
about the plane

837
00:53:15,494 --> 00:53:17,863
is as secret
as the plane itself.

838
00:53:20,032 --> 00:53:23,202
If capture
is a foregone conclusion,

839
00:53:23,235 --> 00:53:25,271
you go down with your plane.

840
00:53:25,304 --> 00:53:28,207
Now, if you think
you can ditch and get away,

841
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,909
if you're close enough
to a border, fine.

842
00:53:29,942 --> 00:53:31,177
You know
the ejection protocol.

843
00:53:33,946 --> 00:53:36,348
But if you ditch,

844
00:53:36,382 --> 00:53:38,484
you bring the dollar with you.

845
00:53:38,517 --> 00:53:41,053
All right,
there's a pin inside.

846
00:53:43,289 --> 00:53:46,225
You scratch your skin
anywhere, it's instantaneous.

847
00:53:46,258 --> 00:53:49,228
If you think you are
about to be captured,

848
00:53:49,261 --> 00:53:50,429
you use it.

849
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,335
Drivers, you understand me?

850
00:53:58,204 --> 00:53:59,872
Spend the dollar.

851
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:57,129
Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the court.

852
00:54:57,162 --> 00:55:00,499
The "Cold War" is not
just a phrase, Your Honor.

853
00:55:00,532 --> 00:55:03,168
It's not just
a figure of speech.

854
00:55:03,202 --> 00:55:05,337
Truly,
a battle is being fought

855
00:55:05,371 --> 00:55:09,174
between two competing views
of the world.

856
00:55:09,208 --> 00:55:12,444
I contend
that Rudolf Ivanovich Abel,

857
00:55:12,478 --> 00:55:14,580
"Colonel Abel,"
as he was called

858
00:55:14,613 --> 00:55:17,049
even by the men
who arrested him,

859
00:55:17,082 --> 00:55:20,219
is our foe in that battle.

860
00:55:20,252 --> 00:55:21,987
Auxiliary power?

861
00:55:22,021 --> 00:55:23,589
Connected and on.

862
00:55:23,622 --> 00:55:26,058
Oxygen seat-pack supply?

863
00:55:26,091 --> 00:55:27,526
Supply at 1,800 psi.

864
00:55:27,559 --> 00:55:29,228
Inverter?

865
00:55:29,261 --> 00:55:30,396
On, light out.

866
00:55:30,429 --> 00:55:33,599
He was treated
as a combatant in that war

867
00:55:33,632 --> 00:55:37,603
until it no longer
suited our government to so treat him.

868
00:55:37,636 --> 00:55:40,005
Accordingly,

869
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:43,475
he was not given the protections
we give our own citizens.

870
00:55:43,509 --> 00:55:45,244
He was subjected
to treatment that,

871
00:55:45,277 --> 00:55:48,047
however appropriate
for a suspected enemy,

872
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,549
was not appropriate
to a suspected criminal.

873
00:55:50,582 --> 00:55:52,017
Fuel transfer?

874
00:55:52,051 --> 00:55:53,118
Transfer switch off.

875
00:55:53,152 --> 00:55:54,253
Destructor?

876
00:55:54,286 --> 00:55:55,421
Destructor safety.

877
00:55:55,454 --> 00:55:56,622
Climb data card.

878
00:55:56,655 --> 00:55:58,190
Installed in aircraft.

879
00:56:12,338 --> 00:56:14,340
I know this man.

880
00:56:14,373 --> 00:56:18,177
If the charge is true, he serves a
foreign power but he serves it faithfully.

881
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:22,147
If he is a soldier in the opposing army,
he is a good soldier.

882
00:56:22,181 --> 00:56:25,117
He has not fled the field
of battle to save himself.

883
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:27,319
He has refused
to serve his captor.

884
00:56:27,353 --> 00:56:29,655
He has refused
to betray his cause.

885
00:56:29,688 --> 00:56:32,257
He has refused
to take the coward's way out.

886
00:56:32,291 --> 00:56:35,127
The coward
must abandon his dignity

887
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,662
before he abandons
the field of battle.

888
00:56:36,695 --> 00:56:40,132
That,
Rudolf Abel will never do.

889
00:56:40,165 --> 00:56:41,266
Shouldn't we,

890
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,469
by giving him
the full benefit

891
00:56:43,502 --> 00:56:46,105
of the rights that define
our system of government,

892
00:56:46,138 --> 00:56:48,540
show this man who we are?

893
00:56:48,574 --> 00:56:51,377
Who we are.

894
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:55,681
Is that not the greatest weapon
we have in this Cold War?

895
00:56:55,714 --> 00:56:58,684
Will we stand by our cause
less resolutely

896
00:56:58,717 --> 00:57:00,652
than he stands by his?

897
00:59:44,683 --> 00:59:46,418
<i>The President announced</i>

898
00:59:46,451 --> 00:59:50,389

I'll be damned if I can find the file

921
01:00:44,643 --> 01:00:47,913
I, uh, Mr. Watters had me
move it over to Jack Elwes's office

922
01:00:47,946 --> 01:00:49,848
along with the first draft
of the appeal.

923
01:00:49,881 --> 01:00:51,383
He did?

924
01:00:51,416 --> 01:00:54,586
Yeah, he redrafted and filed that last week

Someplace fancy.

I'm betting Mr. Young
would like some of the finer things

929
01:01:06,665 --> 01:01:08,400
New York has to offer.

930
01:01:08,433 --> 01:01:10,402
And I want you to give me
the summary of...

931
01:01:28,687 --> 01:01:30,722
Do you know anyone
from Leipzig?

932
01:01:30,756 --> 01:01:35,427
"Leipzig." Am I getting
hate mail from Germany now?

933
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:36,595
From East Germany.

934
01:01:45,637 --> 01:01:47,606
Is it your wife?

935
01:01:47,639 --> 01:01:48,640
No.

936
01:01:49,708 --> 01:01:51,910
No, no, no, no.

937
01:01:51,943 --> 01:01:55,647
She pretends to be
but it's not even a good pretense.

938
01:01:56,882 --> 01:01:59,618
"I'm taking this liberty
to write to you

939
01:01:59,651 --> 01:02:01,887

942
01:02:09,895 --> 01:02:12,564
And do I write back?

943
01:02:15,434 --> 01:02:16,702
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

944
01:02:20,472 --> 01:02:23,842
What's the next move
when you don't know what the game is?

945
01:02:25,811 --> 01:02:27,713
<i>Francis Gary Powers...</i>

946
01:02:29,047 --> 01:02:34,419
On the strength of Article Two
of the U.S.S.R. law

947
01:02:34,453 --> 01:02:38,023
on criminal responsibility
for state crimes

948
01:02:38,056 --> 01:02:40,559
to 10 years of confinement

949
01:02:40,592 --> 01:02:42,961
with the first three years
to be served in prison.

950
01:02:45,564 --> 01:02:47,032
The term of the punishment,

951
01:02:47,065 --> 01:02:49,935
including
preliminary detention,

952
01:02:49,968 --> 01:02:52,637
shall be counted
from May first,

953
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:54,806
nineteen hundred and sixty.

954
01:03:20,632 --> 01:03:22,968
<i>Mr. Donovan,
thank you so much for coming.</i>

955
01:03:23,001 --> 01:03:25,470
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Dulles.

956
01:03:25,504 --> 01:03:26,671
It's an honor, sir.

957
01:03:27,973 --> 01:03:32,077
Nescafe, cream, two lumps.

958
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:34,579
Thank you.

959
01:03:34,613 --> 01:03:36,782
Okay,
this letter you received.

960
01:03:36,815 --> 01:03:39,518
Seems pretty clear that the Soviets
are making an overture here.

961
01:03:40,719 --> 01:03:42,187
They're doing it
through East Germany

962
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:44,589
because they still don't want
to acknowledge Abel as a Soviet citizen,

963
01:03:44,623 --> 01:03:46,758
much less a Soviet spy. So...

964
01:03:48,093 --> 01:03:49,795
Lot of fiction going on.

965
01:03:49,828 --> 01:03:52,063
Yes, sir, but to what end?

966
01:03:52,097 --> 01:03:54,533
They got our guy,
our spy pilot.

967
01:03:54,566 --> 01:03:55,767
We've got their guy.

968
01:03:58,737 --> 01:04:02,007
Prisoner exchange,
I think that's what they're after.

969
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:04,676
Which could hardly be
a surprise to you, Counselor.

970
01:04:04,709 --> 01:04:07,646
It's an eventuality
that I think you foresaw.

971
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:10,849
Yes, I sure did,
and I'm so rarely right.

972
01:04:10,882 --> 01:04:13,985
Well, congratulations.
Red letter day.

973
01:04:14,019 --> 01:04:18,089
Now, we have our man
over there. Powers.

974
01:04:18,123 --> 01:04:22,060
Good man, but with
a head full of classified information.

975
01:04:22,093 --> 01:04:24,729
Abel has a head
full of classified information, too,

976
01:04:24,763 --> 01:04:26,731
but he hasn't
given us a lick.

977
01:04:26,765 --> 01:04:28,567
And, sir, take it from me,
he won't.

978
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,969
Yes, we know that,
but the Russians don't.

979
01:04:31,002 --> 01:04:33,872
They want their man back
before he cracks.

980
01:04:33,905 --> 01:04:36,842
And we want Powers back
for the same reasons.

981
01:04:40,178 --> 01:04:42,547
I think
you are saying, sir,

982
01:04:42,581 --> 01:04:45,016
that there might be
a happy ending for everyone.

983
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:48,019
Yes, if we, um,
indulge their fiction.

984
01:04:56,194 --> 01:04:58,630
We want you
to negotiate the swap

985
01:04:58,663 --> 01:04:59,831
because you're
a private citizen,

986
01:04:59,865 --> 01:05:02,033
so it's not
governments talking.

987
01:05:02,067 --> 01:05:04,769
They don't acknowledge
Abel as a Soviet citizen,

988
01:05:04,803 --> 01:05:08,573
and we don't acknowledge East Germany
as a sovereign country.

989
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:09,875
We haven't
recognized East Berlin

990
01:05:09,908 --> 01:05:12,644
since it was annexed
by the Soviets in '45.

991
01:05:12,677 --> 01:05:15,881
So I act as a negotiator,
representing...

992
01:05:15,914 --> 01:05:17,749
You're not
representing anybody.

993
01:05:17,782 --> 01:05:18,822
Not a government official.

994
01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:21,019
You have no
official standing.

995
01:05:21,052 --> 01:05:23,054
So, some fiction
on our side as well.

996
01:05:23,088 --> 01:05:24,389
Correct.

997
01:05:24,422 --> 01:05:27,792
Which means, of course,
you can't rely on any acknowledgment

998
01:05:27,826 --> 01:05:30,595
or help if things go south.

999
01:05:30,629 --> 01:05:32,697
CIA can't be responsible.

1000
01:05:32,731 --> 01:05:34,032
We can't be embarrassed.

1001
01:05:36,968 --> 01:05:39,104
Where do they want this
negotiation to take place?

1002
01:05:39,137 --> 01:05:40,705
There.

1003
01:05:40,739 --> 01:05:41,940
"There"?

1004
01:05:41,973 --> 01:05:43,141
East Berlin.

1005
01:05:45,744 --> 01:05:47,913
Well, isn't East Berlin
getting rather...

1006
01:05:47,946 --> 01:05:50,148
Oh, yes, the place
is getting complicated.

1007
01:05:52,083 --> 01:05:53,184
Yeah, complicated.

1008
01:05:56,154 --> 01:05:59,658
The Soviet side has been setting up
checkpoints for the past few months

1009
01:05:59,691 --> 01:06:01,993
to try to stop people
hemorrhaging to the Western sectors,

1010
01:06:02,027 --> 01:06:03,862
and it hasn't worked.

1011
01:06:03,895 --> 01:06:05,697
We have intelligence
to suggest

1012
01:06:05,730 --> 01:06:07,866
that they may go
one step further

1013
01:06:07,899 --> 01:06:10,001
and wall off
the entire Eastern sector.

1014
01:06:15,874 --> 01:06:18,109
Okay, that's it
in a nutshell.

1015
01:06:18,143 --> 01:06:20,812
The decision
is entirely yours.

1016
01:06:20,845 --> 01:06:23,915
You need time
to kick it around.

1017
01:06:29,888 --> 01:06:32,123
No.

1018
01:06:32,157 --> 01:06:33,258
No, I don't.

1019
01:06:33,291 --> 01:06:36,194
Well, fine. Fine.

1020
01:06:36,227 --> 01:06:38,797
Best that this all
remains confidential.

1021
01:06:38,830 --> 01:06:43,902
Let's not discuss any of this with, uh,
Mary or with anyone else.

1022
01:06:43,935 --> 01:06:46,071
Share the correspondence
only with us.

1023
01:06:46,104 --> 01:06:47,939
Let us know what they want to do
and when.

1024
01:06:47,973 --> 01:06:50,909
I've got no client,
no wife, no country.

1025
01:06:50,942 --> 01:06:54,012
Don't know what I'm doing
or when or who for.

1026
01:06:54,045 --> 01:06:55,780
You're doing it
for your country,

1027
01:06:55,814 --> 01:06:57,816
but your country
doesn't know that yet.

1028
01:06:57,849 --> 01:07:00,952
What about my client,
the other person in this equation? My guy?

1029
01:07:00,986 --> 01:07:02,854
Your guy?
You mean the Russian?

1030
01:07:02,887 --> 01:07:04,756
He's not your guy anymore,
Counselor.

1031
01:07:04,789 --> 01:07:07,826
Your guy is
Francis Gary Powers now.

1032
01:07:07,859 --> 01:07:10,729
What do I tell
Rudolf Abel?

1033
01:07:10,762 --> 01:07:12,130
Tell him not to drop dead.

1034
01:09:05,110 --> 01:09:06,177
Professor?

1035
01:09:12,083 --> 01:09:13,084
Professor?

1036
01:09:14,085 --> 01:09:16,054
Papa went to university.

1037
01:09:16,087 --> 01:09:18,256
You shouldn't be here,
Frederic.

1038
01:09:18,289 --> 01:09:20,158
They're having
classes today?

1039
01:09:20,191 --> 01:09:22,427
He went to see.
That's where he goes.

1040
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:24,028
What are you doing here?

1041
01:09:24,062 --> 01:09:26,064
I came to get you
and your father.

1042
01:09:26,097 --> 01:09:28,099
You have to come with me.
You might not get out tomorrow.

1043
01:09:28,133 --> 01:09:29,334
Just... Just leave?

1044
01:09:29,367 --> 01:09:31,803
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, leave.
Right now.

1045
01:10:02,967 --> 01:10:05,336
Go back. Go back.

1046
01:10:05,370 --> 01:10:07,906
I'll be okay, I'm American.
Go back.

1047
01:10:07,939 --> 01:10:10,175
Go back to your father's.
We'll find another way. Go.

1048
01:10:16,014 --> 01:10:17,015
Hey!

1049
01:10:17,382 --> 01:10:18,983
So, hi.

1050
01:10:22,253 --> 01:10:24,088
Papers, please.

1051
01:10:24,122 --> 01:10:26,224
<i>Ich bin Student</i>

1052
01:10:26,257 --> 01:10:28,426
Yes,

01:10:39,404 --> 01:10:41,940
My name's Frederic Pryor.
I'm an economics student.

1054
01:10:44,042 --> 01:10:48,112
See?
It's my dissertation.
My thesis.

1055
01:10:50,215 --> 01:10:51,683
You see? Look, look.

1056
01:10:51,716 --> 01:10:55,320
Look "The foreign trade system
of the European Communist nations." Huh?

1057
01:11:00,491 --> 01:11:02,260
It was a lot of work.

1058
01:11:09,434 --> 01:11:12,136
No, that's my only copy.

1059
01:11:13,504 --> 01:11:15,173
No!

1060
01:11:17,375 --> 01:11:18,977
<i>Tell me something.</i>

1061
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:21,079
It came up
at the last minute.

1062
01:11:21,112 --> 01:11:23,414
They have offices
in London.

1063
01:11:23,448 --> 01:11:26,417
These clients.
Not my idea.

1064
01:11:26,451 --> 01:11:29,087
Scotland, this
fishing expedition.

1065
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:31,322
What kind of
fishing trip, Jim?

1066
01:11:31,356 --> 01:11:34,092
Salmon fishing.

1067
01:11:34,125 --> 01:11:36,165
Just tell me that you're
not gonna be in any danger,

1068
01:11:36,194 --> 01:11:37,528
that this is
just a routine business trip,

1069
01:11:37,562 --> 01:11:39,264
and I won't worry.

1070
01:11:39,998 --> 01:11:41,266
I need my passport.

1071
01:11:46,404 --> 01:11:48,072
Just give me something
to hold on to.

1072
01:11:48,106 --> 01:11:49,507
I don't even care
if it's the truth.

1073
01:11:51,542 --> 01:11:53,211
I'm doing this for us.

1074
01:12:16,634 --> 01:12:18,603
Mr. Michener, here,
is your Berlin escort.

1075
01:12:18,636 --> 01:12:21,439
He's an attache
with the U.S. embassy.

1076
01:12:21,472 --> 01:12:24,075
- So, it's gotten goddamn complicated.
Uh-huh.

1077
01:12:24,108 --> 01:12:25,476
As you know,
the last letter from Mrs. Abel,

1078
01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:27,612
whoever she is, talks about
a lawyer in East Berlin,

1079
01:12:27,645 --> 01:12:30,114
Mr. Vogel, whoever he is,
representing her interests, she says.

1080
01:12:30,148 --> 01:12:31,516
Yeah, Vogel says

1081
01:12:31,549 --> 01:12:33,451
he's gone to the Russian
embassy in East Berlin

1082
01:12:33,484 --> 01:12:36,120
and they may be ready
to trade Abel for Powers.

1083
01:12:36,154 --> 01:12:38,056
But no one knows who's who,

1084
01:12:38,089 --> 01:12:39,324
but essentially they're all Russian,
right?

1085
01:12:39,357 --> 01:12:42,160
Well, Soviet.
Well, we think so.

1086
01:12:42,193 --> 01:12:44,362
What do you mean?
Could we turn up the heat in here?

1087
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:48,599
There's a wrinkle.

1088
01:12:48,633 --> 01:12:51,069
They might try
to throw you a curveball.

1089
01:12:51,102 --> 01:12:54,072
Try and get you to accept
another prisoner other than Powers.

1090
01:12:54,105 --> 01:12:55,440
Another American?

1091
01:12:55,473 --> 01:12:58,609
The, uh, East German Stasi
picked up an American student.

1092
01:12:58,643 --> 01:12:59,844
Frederic Pryor.

1093
01:12:59,877 --> 01:13:02,447
Uh, the kid they found on the wrong
side of the Wall.

1094
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,248
He's a grad student
out of Yale.

1095
01:13:04,282 --> 01:13:06,317
- Came over here to study economics.
Mmm-hmm.

1096
01:13:06,351 --> 01:13:10,188
So, they're making noises
about trying this kid for espionage.

1097
01:13:10,221 --> 01:13:12,657
Grave offense, capital crime.
Well.

1098
01:13:12,690 --> 01:13:17,428
Vogel got in touch with us,
said he represents Pryor.

1099
01:13:17,462 --> 01:13:22,400
Wait a minute. Vogel represents Mrs. Abel
and this... This kid?

1100
01:13:22,433 --> 01:13:24,102
Yeah, he's busy.

1101
01:13:25,236 --> 01:13:26,304
Well, so,
what is he?

1102
01:13:26,337 --> 01:13:28,673
Vogel, is he, uh,
East German or is he Russian?

1103
01:13:28,706 --> 01:13:31,376
Well, try to figure it out
when you meet him.

1104
01:13:31,409 --> 01:13:33,678
At Russian embassy,
East Berlin, noon tomorrow.

1105
01:13:33,711 --> 01:13:36,414
Hoffman will show you
how to get there.

1106
01:13:36,447 --> 01:13:38,516
Wait, show me how to get there?
I'm gonna have an escort.

1107
01:13:38,549 --> 01:13:40,385
Right?

1108
01:13:40,418 --> 01:13:42,520
Well, that was the plan
but like I said, there's a wrinkle.

1109
01:13:42,553 --> 01:13:45,289
I won't be taking you.
Decision's been made.

1110
01:13:45,323 --> 01:13:48,092
No U.S. government personnel are to
cross the border until further notice.

1111
01:13:48,126 --> 01:13:49,427
How come?
It's too dangerous.

1112
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:51,295
Yeah, the East Germans
grabbed this kid.

1113
01:13:51,329 --> 01:13:55,266
There's a degree of impunity
that we had not anticipated.

1114
01:13:55,299 --> 01:13:58,269
The point is that the East German agenda
and the Russian agenda

1115
01:13:58,302 --> 01:13:59,704
may not be
the same thing.

1116
01:13:59,737 --> 01:14:01,606
Try and figure it out
and act accordingly.

1117
01:14:01,639 --> 01:14:03,441
And try to make a deal.
Powers for Abel.

1118
01:14:03,474 --> 01:14:06,377
Well, what about this
college kid, Pryor?

1119
01:14:06,411 --> 01:14:09,213
Mmm-mmm.
Don't fall for that.

1120
01:14:09,247 --> 01:14:10,314
We can get him out
another time.

1121
01:14:10,348 --> 01:14:11,549
Powers is the whole
ball game.

1122
01:14:34,605 --> 01:14:36,307
Where's your room?

1123
01:14:37,308 --> 01:14:38,468
I'll be staying
at the Hilton.

1124
01:14:40,711 --> 01:14:41,711
It's not far.

1125
01:14:43,781 --> 01:14:46,350
This is a number here
in West Berlin.

1126
01:14:46,384 --> 01:14:47,744
Memorize it and
give it back to me.

1127
01:14:49,387 --> 01:14:50,621
No, no. I...
I mean, now.

1128
01:14:53,357 --> 01:14:55,359
The Soviets keep cutting
the international lines

1129
01:14:55,393 --> 01:14:57,628
but local calls
are okay.

1130
01:14:57,662 --> 01:14:59,497
Someone will pick up
day and night.

1131
01:15:08,339 --> 01:15:11,676
Now, this docket attached to your passport
will serve as your ticket

1132
01:15:11,709 --> 01:15:13,611
into and out of
the Eastern Soviet sector.

1133
01:15:15,713 --> 01:15:17,593
The meeting with Vogel
is set for noon tomorrow.

1134
01:15:24,355 --> 01:15:26,257
There are only a few routes
left to the East.

1135
01:15:26,290 --> 01:15:28,493
You take the S-Bahn, the station we showed
you on the way in.

1136
01:15:28,526 --> 01:15:30,795
You're gonna get off
at the Friedrichstrasse station here

1137
01:15:30,828 --> 01:15:33,731
and walk to the Soviet embassy
on Unter den Linden here.

1138
01:15:33,764 --> 01:15:36,400
Look at the map now.
You shouldn't take it with you.

1139
01:15:36,434 --> 01:15:38,536
You're looking at a map,
you're an American, you're a spy.

1140
01:15:38,569 --> 01:15:40,571
You could
well be detained.

1141
01:15:40,605 --> 01:15:42,673
Just avoid interacting
with people generally.

1142
01:15:42,707 --> 01:15:45,643
You don't...
You don't belong, so don't stick out.

1143
01:15:45,676 --> 01:15:47,778
Food is scarce over there
and things have started to fall apart.

1144
01:15:47,812 --> 01:15:49,013
There are gangs,

1145
01:15:49,046 --> 01:15:52,316
and rule of law is less firmly
established over there.

1146
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:54,352
And definitely stay away
from the Wall.

1147
01:15:54,385 --> 01:15:55,553
On their side,
there's a line

1148
01:15:55,586 --> 01:15:56,621
cleared of buildings
along the Wall.

1149
01:15:56,654 --> 01:15:58,356
They call it
the "Death Line."

1150
01:15:58,389 --> 01:16:00,291
Cross it and
you'll be shot.

1151
01:16:00,324 --> 01:16:02,660
Is there any outcome here
where I'm not either detained or shot?

1152
01:16:02,693 --> 01:16:05,296
Don't worry too much
about what Michener said.

1153
01:16:05,329 --> 01:16:07,365
No, I'm worried about
what you're saying.

1154
01:16:07,398 --> 01:16:09,400
This kid, Pryor,

1155
01:16:09,433 --> 01:16:10,835
that the East Germans have,
how old is he?

1156
01:16:10,868 --> 01:16:13,271
Twenty-five. Why?

1157
01:16:13,304 --> 01:16:14,472
Same age as Dougie.

1158
01:16:16,807 --> 01:16:18,309
Who?

1159
01:16:18,342 --> 01:16:19,810
Eh, an associate of mine.

1160
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:23,414
Frederic Pryor.

1161
01:18:00,611 --> 01:18:01,746
Okay, okay, okay.

1162
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:50,695
<i>Danke.</i>

1163
01:19:47,852 --> 01:19:53,624
So, we apologize
if this offends.

1164
01:19:58,963 --> 01:20:00,731
Uh...
Coat?

1165
01:20:19,984 --> 01:20:20,985
Okay.

1166
01:21:14,572 --> 01:21:17,608
Do you understand English?
Yes, sir.

1167
01:21:17,641 --> 01:21:19,743
I'm James Donovan.
I'm here to meet a Mr. Vogel.

1168
01:21:19,777 --> 01:21:21,879
Mr. Vogel.
He doesn't work here.

1169
01:21:21,912 --> 01:21:23,832
I'm just supposed to meet him.
That's all I know.

1170
01:21:47,204 --> 01:21:48,839
Mr. Donovan!

1171
01:21:49,707 --> 01:21:51,041
So we finally meet you.

1172
01:21:53,210 --> 01:21:54,845
I'm Helen Abel.

1173
01:21:54,879 --> 01:21:56,180
How is our husband?
Oh. He's fine.

1174
01:21:56,213 --> 01:21:57,681
How is my Rudolf?

1175
01:21:57,715 --> 01:21:59,650
As good as
can be expected.

1176
01:21:59,683 --> 01:22:02,186
And we will
get him back, yes?

1177
01:22:02,219 --> 01:22:04,655
This is our daughter.
How do you do?

1178
01:22:05,055 --> 01:22:06,055
Lydia.

1179
01:22:06,690 --> 01:22:07,892
Are you Mr. Vogel?

1180
01:22:08,826 --> 01:22:10,160
No, no, no!

1181
01:22:10,194 --> 01:22:11,929
I'm not Vogel.

1182
01:22:11,962 --> 01:22:13,130
I'm cousin Drews.

1183
01:22:15,065 --> 01:22:16,934
This is Rudolf's
beloved cousin Drews.

1184
01:22:16,967 --> 01:22:19,169
Yes, cousin Drews.
I am cousin Drews.

1185
01:22:19,203 --> 01:22:20,905
Cousin Drews, yes.

1186
01:22:20,938 --> 01:22:21,972
I'm Helen Abel.

1187
01:22:26,110 --> 01:22:27,177
When will you see him?

1188
01:22:28,946 --> 01:22:30,948
When will your government
release him?

1189
01:22:30,981 --> 01:22:32,950
I'm a little,
uh, lost here.

1190
01:22:32,983 --> 01:22:34,852
I'm supposed to meet
a Mr. Vogel.

1191
01:22:34,885 --> 01:22:36,987
Oh, Mr. Vogel
is our lawyer.

1192
01:22:37,021 --> 01:22:40,958
We were supposed to negotiate,
uh, the exchange.

1193
01:22:40,991 --> 01:22:43,761
To bring Rudolf here?
Yes, yes, to bring him here.

1194
01:22:43,794 --> 01:22:46,630
But it doesn't happen unilaterally,
do you understand?

1195
01:22:46,664 --> 01:22:48,165
It has to be
an exchange.

1196
01:22:51,802 --> 01:22:52,970
Not here?

1197
01:23:00,077 --> 01:23:01,111
Shh.

1198
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:04,982
Shh. Shh.

1199
01:23:13,290 --> 01:23:14,892
Mr. Donovan?

1200
01:23:14,925 --> 01:23:16,060
Mr. Vogel.

1201
01:23:16,093 --> 01:23:17,995
No, no, no.
Goodness.

1202
01:23:18,028 --> 01:23:20,130
My name is Schischkin.
Ivan Schischkin.

1203
01:23:20,164 --> 01:23:22,232
I'm the second secretary
of the Soviet embassy.

1204
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:26,770
It wouldn't be appropriate
for Mr. Vogel to join us.

1205
01:23:26,804 --> 01:23:28,973
He is a German national.

1206
01:23:29,006 --> 01:23:31,208
So you aren't here to...

1207
01:23:31,241 --> 01:23:34,812
To facilitate this meeting.

1208
01:23:34,845 --> 01:23:37,915
Uh, perhaps Mrs. Abel

1209
01:23:37,948 --> 01:23:40,117
would like to compose
herself privately?

1210
01:23:40,150 --> 01:23:43,120
And let Mr. Donovan
and myself to talk?

1211
01:23:45,222 --> 01:23:46,223
Thank you.

1212
01:23:56,133 --> 01:23:58,836
So, I'm confused.
Yes.

1213
01:23:58,869 --> 01:24:00,304
Uh, I don't care
who I talk to

1214
01:24:00,337 --> 01:24:03,807
if it's about
an exchange of personnel.

1215
01:24:03,841 --> 01:24:05,809
Are you the person
to talk to?

1216
01:24:05,843 --> 01:24:08,779
Yes, yes, yes, of course.
Uh, we should talk.

1217
01:24:08,812 --> 01:24:11,048
Please, have a seat,
Mr. Donovan.

1218
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:14,952
Uh, how did you arrive
to the Eastern sector?

1219
01:24:14,985 --> 01:24:16,053
The train.
The S-Bahn.

1220
01:24:16,086 --> 01:24:17,855
Ah, and you were alone?

1221
01:24:17,888 --> 01:24:19,323
Yeah.

1222
01:24:19,356 --> 01:24:22,726
And you are
credentialed?

1223
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:24,728
Now, you must know
about me, sir.

1224
01:24:24,762 --> 01:24:26,263
I'm a private citizen.

1225
01:24:26,296 --> 01:24:28,265
I'm a lawyer in Brooklyn
in the United States,

1226
01:24:28,298 --> 01:24:30,934
and I've taken time
out of my busy schedule

1227
01:24:30,968 --> 01:24:33,737
to help my client,
Rudolf Abel.

1228
01:24:33,771 --> 01:24:37,808
I'm authorized to arrange
an exchange of Abel

1229
01:24:37,841 --> 01:24:40,277
for Francis Gary Powers.

1230
01:24:40,310 --> 01:24:43,180
This is a full
pardon of Abel

1231
01:24:43,213 --> 01:24:45,533
that will be signed
when the exchange actually takes place.

1232
01:24:46,850 --> 01:24:48,218
This is the only
reason I'm here.

1233
01:24:48,252 --> 01:24:51,021
I hope and expect to make
this arrangement quickly.

1234
01:24:52,089 --> 01:24:54,124
Abel for Francis
Gary Powers

1235
01:24:56,060 --> 01:24:57,795
and Frederic Pryor.

1236
01:25:00,064 --> 01:25:02,066
Mmm, we don't have Pryor.

1237
01:25:02,099 --> 01:25:04,068
No? You don't?

1238
01:25:06,370 --> 01:25:09,039
I've heard of Pryor,
but he's held

1239
01:25:09,073 --> 01:25:12,209
by the German
Democratic Republic,

1240
01:25:12,242 --> 01:25:15,079
not by the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics.

1241
01:25:16,013 --> 01:25:18,982
Well, I'll tell you
the first problem.

1242
01:25:19,016 --> 01:25:22,019
The names of your countries
are too long.

1243
01:25:22,052 --> 01:25:25,122
Yes, yes.

1244
01:25:26,223 --> 01:25:28,192
If we release Powers,

1245
01:25:28,225 --> 01:25:30,194
it is only to
promote a goodwill

1246
01:25:30,227 --> 01:25:31,361
between our countries.

1247
01:25:33,130 --> 01:25:35,766
So, it cannot be
an exchange.

1248
01:25:39,002 --> 01:25:40,204
Perhaps...

1249
01:25:40,237 --> 01:25:43,107
Perhaps you could
release Abel

1250
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:45,075
as a token of goodwill
to our friends in Germany,

1251
01:25:45,109 --> 01:25:47,978
and then,
some months later,

1252
01:25:48,011 --> 01:25:50,414
we would release Powers.

1253
01:25:50,447 --> 01:25:52,883
There is an idea.
No. That just won't work for us at all.

1254
01:25:52,916 --> 01:25:55,219
See, we need this to be
an exchange.

1255
01:25:55,252 --> 01:25:57,020
You can call it
what you want,

1256
01:25:57,054 --> 01:25:58,889
but an exchange
it must be.

1257
01:25:58,922 --> 01:26:02,059
We can have Abel here
within 48 hours.

1258
01:26:02,092 --> 01:26:05,262
We need Powers
at the same time we give you Abel.

1259
01:26:07,464 --> 01:26:10,234
Hmm. This is...

1260
01:26:10,267 --> 01:26:14,171
Can we call this
the "impatient plan"?

1261
01:26:14,204 --> 01:26:16,039
Well, you can call it
whatever you want.

1262
01:26:18,208 --> 01:26:21,044
I can relay your
impatient plan to Moscow,

1263
01:26:21,078 --> 01:26:21,945
see what they say...

1264
01:26:21,979 --> 01:26:25,315
But they will wonder
why so impatient.

1265
01:26:26,917 --> 01:26:28,318
Because I have a cold.

1266
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:30,272
And I don't live in Berlin
and I want to go home.

1267
01:26:31,221 --> 01:26:32,322
They will think,

1268
01:26:32,356 --> 01:26:35,192
"Well, the Americans
must have gotten

1269
01:26:35,225 --> 01:26:38,162
"all the information
that Abel had to give.

1270
01:26:38,195 --> 01:26:41,999
"And now they're impatient
to trade him,

1271
01:26:42,032 --> 01:26:45,068
"hoping to get in return
this man, Powers,

1272
01:26:45,102 --> 01:26:47,204
"that, perhaps,
has not yet given up

1273
01:26:47,237 --> 01:26:49,239
"all the information
that he has to give."

1274
01:26:51,108 --> 01:26:53,243
This is not
an equitable trade, sir.

1275
01:26:54,511 --> 01:26:56,146
But what you're saying is,

1276
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:58,182
if Powers has given up
everything he knows,

1277
01:26:58,215 --> 01:27:00,450
then Moscow would trade?

1278
01:27:00,484 --> 01:27:02,052
Why wouldn't they?

1279
01:27:03,220 --> 01:27:06,256
As for Abel, if he dies
in an American prison,

1280
01:27:06,290 --> 01:27:08,959
the next Russian operative
who gets caught

1281
01:27:08,992 --> 01:27:11,028
might think twice about
keeping his mouth shut.

1282
01:27:11,061 --> 01:27:16,400
And you never know.
Abel might want to see the sky again

1283
01:27:16,433 --> 01:27:19,469
and decide to trade Russian
secrets for small American favors.

1284
01:27:23,307 --> 01:27:25,375
How can we know this?

1285
01:27:25,409 --> 01:27:29,079
We little men,
we just do our jobs.

1286
01:27:29,112 --> 01:27:31,448
Like Lieutenant Powers.
He's just a pilot.

1287
01:27:34,284 --> 01:27:38,121
He was making photographs
from 70,000 feet

1288
01:27:38,155 --> 01:27:39,315
when he was shot
from the sky.

1289
01:27:40,290 --> 01:27:42,359
People in my country
consider this

1290
01:27:42,392 --> 01:27:44,228
an act of war.

1291
01:27:46,563 --> 01:27:49,333
We have to get off this
merry-go-round, sir.

1292
01:27:49,366 --> 01:27:51,134
The next mistake
our countries make

1293
01:27:51,168 --> 01:27:52,936
could be the last one.

1294
01:27:54,137 --> 01:27:56,406
We need to have
the conversation

1295
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:58,141
our governments can't.

1296
01:28:03,447 --> 01:28:06,116
I will ask Moscow.

1297
01:28:06,149 --> 01:28:08,118
Who knows
what they will say.

1298
01:28:10,053 --> 01:28:11,388
There are a lot of people,
Mr. Donovan,

1299
01:28:11,421 --> 01:28:15,525
who doesn't want this
exchange to ever take place.

1300
01:28:18,462 --> 01:28:21,999
Can you come back tomorrow
to discuss their answer?

1301
01:28:22,032 --> 01:28:23,033
Powers for Abel.

1302
01:28:23,066 --> 01:28:24,534
And Frederic Pryor.

1303
01:28:24,568 --> 01:28:26,069
As I said,

1304
01:28:26,103 --> 01:28:28,272
Pryor is in the hands
of the organs of

1305
01:28:28,305 --> 01:28:30,507
State Security of the German
Democratic Republic.

1306
01:28:30,540 --> 01:28:33,110
I'm confident you can
make arrangements.

1307
01:28:33,143 --> 01:28:35,445
I am merely a secretary

1308
01:28:35,479 --> 01:28:37,180
in the embassy
of foreign power.

1309
01:28:37,214 --> 01:28:38,548
Okay, okay.

1310
01:28:38,582 --> 01:28:42,185
You have to see Mr. Vogel.
I'll give you his address.

1311
01:28:42,219 --> 01:28:44,154
There actually is
a Mr. Vogel?

1312
01:28:44,187 --> 01:28:46,456
Why would you
imagine otherwise?

1313
01:28:46,490 --> 01:28:48,392
Uh, it's a short cab ride.

1314
01:28:49,593 --> 01:28:52,429
And please, Mr. Donovan,

1315
01:28:52,462 --> 01:28:54,298
wear an overcoat
in this weather.

1316
01:28:56,099 --> 01:28:57,301
I had mine
stolen from me.

1317
01:28:58,635 --> 01:29:00,304
What do you expect?

1318
01:29:00,337 --> 01:29:02,172
It was from
Saks Fifth Avenue.

1319
01:29:03,507 --> 01:29:04,507
Wasn't it?

1320
01:29:13,250 --> 01:29:14,584
Mr. Donovan.

1321
01:29:14,618 --> 01:29:16,053
Mr. Vogel.

1322
01:29:16,086 --> 01:29:18,055
Please come in.

1323
01:29:18,088 --> 01:29:19,189
<i>Danke.</i>

1324
01:29:22,559 --> 01:29:24,328
Sorry about the embassy.

1325
01:29:26,396 --> 01:29:28,332
But the Soviets decided
not to host me.

1326
01:29:30,133 --> 01:29:32,035
Very irritating.

1327
01:29:32,069 --> 01:29:34,371
I am still trying
to grasp each party's...

1328
01:29:35,339 --> 01:29:37,107
Status?

1329
01:29:37,140 --> 01:29:40,243
Yes. And interest
in the proceedings.

1330
01:29:40,277 --> 01:29:41,345
Oh.

1331
01:29:41,378 --> 01:29:43,313
It's a new world.

1332
01:29:43,347 --> 01:29:45,382
All very disorienting,
isn't it?

1333
01:29:55,692 --> 01:29:57,427
Let me tell you
what I have to offer.

1334
01:30:00,297 --> 01:30:02,132
I'm a good friend...

1335
01:30:02,165 --> 01:30:04,201
"Friend."
No, he's older.

1336
01:30:04,234 --> 01:30:06,136
"Protege"?

1337
01:30:06,169 --> 01:30:08,638
Of the attorney general
of the German Democratic Republic.

1338
01:30:08,672 --> 01:30:10,073
Sit down, please.

1339
01:30:13,276 --> 01:30:15,145
This unfortunate,

1340
01:30:15,178 --> 01:30:17,381
Frederic Pryor,

1341
01:30:17,414 --> 01:30:20,317
he was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

1342
01:30:20,350 --> 01:30:23,420
But every accident,
properly viewed,

1343
01:30:23,453 --> 01:30:25,555
is an opportunity,
isn't it, Mr. Donovan?

1344
01:30:25,589 --> 01:30:28,558
Well...
Your country refuses to recognize

1345
01:30:28,592 --> 01:30:31,261
the German
Democratic Republic.

1346
01:30:31,294 --> 01:30:33,296
They prefer to
make up stories

1347
01:30:33,330 --> 01:30:34,930
that the GDR doesn't
exist, for instance.

1348
01:30:37,300 --> 01:30:39,336
Sorry.

1349
01:30:39,369 --> 01:30:41,705
As a means of forcing your
government's recognition

1350
01:30:41,738 --> 01:30:44,274
of this real place, sir,

1351
01:30:44,307 --> 01:30:46,176
in which you
find yourself,

1352
01:30:46,209 --> 01:30:47,677
the GDR,

1353
01:30:47,711 --> 01:30:50,180
the attorney general is
happy to negotiate with you

1354
01:30:50,213 --> 01:30:52,449
as a representative
of your government

1355
01:30:52,482 --> 01:30:53,717
for Mr. Pryor's return.

1356
01:30:53,750 --> 01:30:55,318
Mr. Vogel,
I'm not here

1357
01:30:55,352 --> 01:30:57,387
as a representative
of my government.

1358
01:31:00,457 --> 01:31:01,457
All right.

1359
01:31:04,461 --> 01:31:06,630
I think that's childish,
Mr. Donovan.

1360
01:31:06,663 --> 01:31:09,299
Well, I... I have
no official status.

1361
01:31:09,332 --> 01:31:10,700
Fine.

1362
01:31:10,734 --> 01:31:13,537
You do not represent the USA,
I do not represent the GDR.

1363
01:31:13,570 --> 01:31:15,705
My client is Lydia Abel,
Rudolf's wife.

1364
01:31:15,739 --> 01:31:17,340
And I have also...

1365
01:31:17,374 --> 01:31:19,443
Lydia is the daughter.
Helen is the wife.

1366
01:31:25,382 --> 01:31:26,416
Well...

1367
01:31:28,285 --> 01:31:29,686
I am prepared to offer

1368
01:31:29,719 --> 01:31:32,589
Frederic Pryor's exchange
for Rudolf Abel's.

1369
01:31:34,324 --> 01:31:35,625
Then let's be clear.

1370
01:31:35,659 --> 01:31:37,761
We will produce
Rudolf Abel.

1371
01:31:37,794 --> 01:31:41,164
You will produce,
at the same time, the student, Pryor.

1372
01:31:41,698 --> 01:31:43,200
At the same time?

1373
01:31:43,233 --> 01:31:44,668
Absolutely.

1374
01:31:44,701 --> 01:31:49,272
The exchange on offer
is a Russian at the end of his life

1375
01:31:51,575 --> 01:31:54,344
for an American student
at the start of his.

1376
01:32:01,284 --> 01:32:04,254
Schischkin? He's not
an embassy secretary.

1377
01:32:04,287 --> 01:32:07,257
Ivan Schischkin is the KGB's
chief in western Europe.

1378
01:32:07,290 --> 01:32:08,592
Well, whatever he is,

1379
01:32:08,625 --> 01:32:11,528
he's relaying our
proposal to Moscow

1380
01:32:13,363 --> 01:32:14,531
and they'll decide.

1381
01:32:14,564 --> 01:32:17,334
Could I borrow a coat?
I lost mine.

1382
01:32:17,367 --> 01:32:18,802
How did you
lose your coat?

1383
01:32:18,835 --> 01:32:20,704
You know, spy stuff.

1384
01:32:23,306 --> 01:32:26,309
I'll get you another coat.
Good, because...

1385
01:32:26,343 --> 01:32:28,512
So who is, uh...
Who is this Vogel?

1386
01:32:29,412 --> 01:32:31,214
Him, we don't know.

1387
01:32:31,248 --> 01:32:33,517
He might be what you
said he said he is.

1388
01:32:33,550 --> 01:32:34,784
Friend of
the attorney general.

1389
01:32:34,818 --> 01:32:38,522
Just some guy the GDR
tapped to handle this.

1390
01:32:38,555 --> 01:32:40,457
Sounds like
the East Germans

1391
01:32:40,490 --> 01:32:43,226
are fighting for
a place at our table.

1392
01:32:43,260 --> 01:32:46,296
The GDR gets Abel back
for the Russians,

1393
01:32:46,329 --> 01:32:47,497
winning their respect...

1394
01:32:47,531 --> 01:32:50,300
And capturing the headlines
for their cause.

1395
01:32:50,333 --> 01:32:52,569
Which, of course,
puts East Germany on the map.

1396
01:32:52,602 --> 01:32:55,305
But we don't care
about their map.

1397
01:32:55,338 --> 01:32:56,806
Stick with
the Russians.

1398
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:59,442
Stick with the Russians.
It's Powers for Abel.

1399
01:32:59,476 --> 01:33:02,612
So, does all this mean
this might actually happen?

1400
01:33:02,646 --> 01:33:04,514
Yeah, that's what
you seem to be telling me.

1401
01:33:04,548 --> 01:33:07,584
We'll put Abel on a plane,
he'll be here Friday.

1402
01:33:07,617 --> 01:33:09,619
So, if Schischkin
gets the okay,

1403
01:33:09,653 --> 01:33:11,821
all that's left is the
mechanics of the trade.

1404
01:33:11,855 --> 01:33:13,690
How we swap our guy
for their guy.

1405
01:33:13,723 --> 01:33:15,825
Our "guys." Two guys.

1406
01:33:15,859 --> 01:33:18,328
Powers and Pryor.

1407
01:33:18,361 --> 01:33:21,298
No, now don't go
bleeding heart on me.

1408
01:33:21,331 --> 01:33:23,533
Powers is the whole
ball game.

1409
01:33:23,567 --> 01:33:25,335
Forget this
Ivy League boy,

1410
01:33:25,368 --> 01:33:27,470
who obviously thought
it was a good idea

1411
01:33:27,504 --> 01:33:29,873
to study Soviet
economics in Berlin

1412
01:33:29,906 --> 01:33:31,608
in the middle
of the Cold War.

1413
01:33:33,376 --> 01:33:34,711
Powers is who we need.

1414
01:33:35,745 --> 01:33:37,547
You don't even
like Powers.

1415
01:33:38,815 --> 01:33:41,484
Everybody hates Powers.

1416
01:33:41,518 --> 01:33:45,722
He didn't kill himself and he let the
commies parade him on television.

1417
01:33:45,755 --> 01:33:48,291
He's the most
hated man in America.

1418
01:33:48,325 --> 01:33:50,827
After Rudolf Abel,
maybe.

1419
01:33:50,860 --> 01:33:52,529
And me.

1420
01:34:01,538 --> 01:34:02,606
Now wake up!

1421
01:34:11,648 --> 01:34:13,516
I gotta sleep.

1422
01:34:13,550 --> 01:34:14,851
I just gotta sleep.

1423
01:34:18,555 --> 01:34:19,723
I told you,
you can sleep

1424
01:34:19,756 --> 01:34:21,591
once we talk
what we need to talk.

1425
01:34:21,625 --> 01:34:24,461
You must focus on me.

1426
01:34:24,494 --> 01:34:26,863
Your government doesn't care about you.
You know that.

1427
01:34:26,896 --> 01:34:28,098
Any of you.

1428
01:34:28,131 --> 01:34:31,801
You know that twelve
U-2 pilots incurred brain damage?

1429
01:34:31,835 --> 01:34:35,405
They're vegetables because of altitude,
insufficient oxygen.

1430
01:34:35,438 --> 01:34:37,407
But they keep you
flying, Gary.

1431
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:39,509
You and your friends.

1432
01:34:39,542 --> 01:34:42,946
They gave you this.
A scratcher, yes?

1433
01:34:42,979 --> 01:34:45,749
Potassium cyanide.

1434
01:34:45,782 --> 01:34:48,718
Does that look like
they care about you?

1435
01:35:17,814 --> 01:35:21,384
What is the construction
of the destructor unit?

1436
01:35:21,418 --> 01:35:23,453
By what means
is this unit operated?

1437
01:35:23,486 --> 01:35:26,589
With what explosives
is the unit charged,

1438
01:35:26,623 --> 01:35:28,458
and what destruction
is it capable of?

1439
01:35:29,025 --> 01:35:30,994
I don't know.

1440
01:35:31,027 --> 01:35:33,430
The pilots were never shown
any of the equipment.

1441
01:35:33,463 --> 01:35:35,732
How wide far
can the radar

1442
01:35:35,765 --> 01:35:37,667
map an area during
an overflight?

1443
01:35:37,701 --> 01:35:38,702
I don't know,
I don't know!

1444
01:35:38,735 --> 01:35:42,706
Were you making
the overflight on April 9th

1445
01:35:42,739 --> 01:35:45,442
over the industrial area
and MiG bomber base

1446
01:35:45,475 --> 01:35:46,543
at Baranovichi?

1447
01:35:46,576 --> 01:35:48,478
I was not.

1448
01:35:48,511 --> 01:35:49,879
This was my
first overflight.

1449
01:35:49,913 --> 01:35:53,850
I need to know about
engine-out to glide ratio.

1450
01:35:53,883 --> 01:35:56,920
How the plane
gets so high.

1451
01:35:56,953 --> 01:36:01,891
We know it reaches
altitude of 70,000 feet.

1452
01:36:01,925 --> 01:36:03,860
Gary, we know this.

1453
01:36:03,893 --> 01:36:06,496
And I need to know
where the planes have flown.

1454
01:36:06,529 --> 01:36:08,898
Where they
have flown, Gary.

1455
01:36:08,932 --> 01:36:10,600
And we must have
this talk now.

1456
01:36:13,803 --> 01:36:15,739
Now.

1457
01:36:15,772 --> 01:36:18,441
And then you can
sleep a little.

1458
01:36:22,645 --> 01:36:24,447
<i>Sir, wake up.</i>

1459
01:36:25,882 --> 01:36:26,882
Wake up, sir.

1460
01:36:29,753 --> 01:36:31,721
Sir, can you come with me, please?
Yeah.

1461
01:36:31,755 --> 01:36:33,790
We gotta move.
Yeah, of course.

1462
01:36:33,823 --> 01:36:35,058
Can you come with me, please?
Yeah.

1463
01:36:35,091 --> 01:36:36,659
Okay.

1464
01:36:37,727 --> 01:36:39,529
Got your glasses?
Uh-huh.

1465
01:36:39,562 --> 01:36:42,799
What time is it?
It's late, but we need to talk,

1466
01:36:42,832 --> 01:36:44,432
and then we need to
get on a plane, okay?

1467
01:36:45,668 --> 01:36:47,771
Yeah.
Yep. Upsy-daisy!

1468
01:36:47,804 --> 01:36:49,706
Upsy-daisy.
That's right.

1469
01:36:49,739 --> 01:36:51,007
There we go.
Keep it moving.

1470
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:52,509
Thank you.

1471
01:36:54,778 --> 01:36:56,479
Other way, other way.

1472
01:36:56,513 --> 01:36:57,547
There we go.

1473
01:36:57,580 --> 01:36:58,815
You say a plane?

1474
01:36:58,848 --> 01:37:00,717
This way, please.
Keep moving.

1475
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:03,720
<i>So, I received
a favorable decision</i>

1476
01:37:03,753 --> 01:37:05,822
<i>from Moscow
on your proposal</i>

1477
01:37:05,855 --> 01:37:08,825
that we help our friends in the German
Democratic Republic

1478
01:37:09,092 --> 01:37:10,860
by exchanging

1479
01:37:10,894 --> 01:37:12,862
Mr. Powers
for Mr. Abel.

1480
01:37:14,864 --> 01:37:16,099
That's swell.

1481
01:37:16,132 --> 01:37:20,703
May I suggest the Glienicke Bridge
as a place of a swap?

1482
01:37:20,737 --> 01:37:22,005
Why not Checkpoint
Charlie?

1483
01:37:22,038 --> 01:37:24,707
We're not
looking for publicity.

1484
01:37:24,741 --> 01:37:26,676
The Glienicke Bridge
is very quiet,

1485
01:37:26,709 --> 01:37:27,977
especially early
in the morning.

1486
01:37:28,011 --> 01:37:30,780
Glienicke Bridge.
I'll run that by our side.

1487
01:37:30,814 --> 01:37:32,582
We can have Abel here
on Friday.

1488
01:37:32,615 --> 01:37:33,917
So, Saturday morning?

1489
01:37:33,950 --> 01:37:35,985
Always impatience, yeah?

1490
01:37:36,019 --> 01:37:37,654
I want to get home
and get into bed.

1491
01:37:37,687 --> 01:37:39,956
So, Saturday morning?

1492
01:37:39,989 --> 01:37:41,591
5:30?

1493
01:37:41,624 --> 01:37:43,126
All right.

1494
01:37:43,159 --> 01:37:44,861
We're done here.

1495
01:37:44,894 --> 01:37:46,129
This is a number,

1496
01:37:46,162 --> 01:37:49,599
in case anything
should come up.

1497
01:37:49,632 --> 01:37:50,733
All right.

1498
01:37:50,767 --> 01:37:52,702
Someone will answer
at any hour.

1499
01:37:53,803 --> 01:37:55,104
I don't expect
to use it.

1500
01:37:56,706 --> 01:37:59,008
Shall we toast
the arrangement?

1501
01:37:59,042 --> 01:38:00,577
Why not?

1502
01:38:02,178 --> 01:38:03,713
Armenian brandy.

1503
01:38:03,746 --> 01:38:05,515
Good bracer for your cold.
Thank you.

1504
01:38:06,683 --> 01:38:07,884
Would you mind...

1505
01:38:07,917 --> 01:38:09,752
This is not part
of our business

1506
01:38:09,786 --> 01:38:12,021
but I'd like to ask you
a couple of questions.

1507
01:38:12,055 --> 01:38:13,756
You do not
have to answer.

1508
01:38:13,790 --> 01:38:14,991
I shall answer
what I know.

1509
01:38:15,992 --> 01:38:19,028
I like this guy,
your guy.

1510
01:38:19,062 --> 01:38:21,965
What happens to your guy
when he gets home?

1511
01:38:21,998 --> 01:38:24,000
Well, we have to make
a determination

1512
01:38:24,033 --> 01:38:26,703
whether our guy
is now your guy.

1513
01:38:26,736 --> 01:38:28,605
Now, as I said
to you before,

1514
01:38:28,638 --> 01:38:29,873
he's acted
honorably.

1515
01:38:29,906 --> 01:38:31,641
He's still your guy,
believe me.

1516
01:38:31,674 --> 01:38:34,644
Of course you will
say that if it were true

1517
01:38:34,677 --> 01:38:36,880
and if it were
not true.

1518
01:38:36,913 --> 01:38:39,182
I guess it has
come down to that, huh?

1519
01:38:39,215 --> 01:38:40,917
Well, forgive me
for pushing,

1520
01:38:40,950 --> 01:38:43,786
but is he
in any danger

1521
01:38:43,820 --> 01:38:46,122
if the determination
is made?

1522
01:38:46,155 --> 01:38:48,591
Well, goodness.

1523
01:38:48,625 --> 01:38:51,194
As things are now,
everyone is in danger.

1524
01:38:51,227 --> 01:38:52,795
Cheers.

1525
01:38:52,829 --> 01:38:54,030
<i>Na zdorovie.</i>

1526
01:39:06,943 --> 01:39:08,878
There will be no exchange
on Glienicke Bridge.

1527
01:39:09,979 --> 01:39:11,915
Excuse me, sir.

1528
01:39:11,948 --> 01:39:13,983
There will be
no exchange.

1529
01:39:14,851 --> 01:39:16,719
Not for Frederic Pryor.

1530
01:39:16,753 --> 01:39:19,856
Mr. Vogel, I thought
yesterday we had agreed.

1531
01:39:19,889 --> 01:39:22,125
We agreed on an exchange,
Abel for Pryor.

1532
01:39:23,860 --> 01:39:26,996
Now I learn you are
a rug merchant

1533
01:39:27,030 --> 01:39:29,899
selling the same rug
to two customers.

1534
01:39:29,933 --> 01:39:32,802
Abel for Pryor you sell to us.
Yeah.

1535
01:39:32,835 --> 01:39:35,038
And Abel for Powers
you sell to the Soviets.

1536
01:39:35,071 --> 01:39:37,707
I'm not quite sure
what the problem is

1537
01:39:37,740 --> 01:39:40,944
if the arrangement satisfies
two parties or three or four.

1538
01:39:40,977 --> 01:39:42,111
What difference
does it make?

1539
01:39:42,145 --> 01:39:44,113
The arrangement does not
satisfy this party.

1540
01:39:48,985 --> 01:39:50,019
Now, Mr. Vogel, please...

1541
01:39:50,053 --> 01:39:52,989
Obviously you do not know
who you are dealing with.

1542
01:39:55,058 --> 01:39:57,694
Here's the interest
of the German Democratic Republic.

1543
01:39:58,995 --> 01:40:00,196
To deal with,

1544
01:40:00,229 --> 01:40:03,099
and to be seen to be dealing
with another sovereign power,

1545
01:40:03,132 --> 01:40:04,767
the United States.

1546
01:40:04,801 --> 01:40:06,869
An equal power.

1547
01:40:06,903 --> 01:40:08,271
Instead you treat us
as stooges

1548
01:40:08,304 --> 01:40:10,273
for the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics.

1549
01:40:10,306 --> 01:40:12,709
Can we just call them the Russians?
It'll save time.

1550
01:40:14,177 --> 01:40:16,145
I have an appointment, sir.

1551
01:40:16,179 --> 01:40:17,947
I think it's you
who are wasting time.

1552
01:40:17,981 --> 01:40:20,016
Now, tell me if
I am describing this wrong.

1553
01:40:20,049 --> 01:40:21,784
You have a kid,
a university student,

1554
01:40:21,818 --> 01:40:23,152
someone you know
is not a spy,

1555
01:40:23,186 --> 01:40:24,687
who's no threat to you.

1556
01:40:24,721 --> 01:40:26,155
And in exchange
for this person

1557
01:40:26,189 --> 01:40:27,924
who is worthless to you,

1558
01:40:27,957 --> 01:40:30,126
you play an equal part
in an exchange

1559
01:40:30,159 --> 01:40:32,228
between the Russians
and the Americans.

1560
01:40:32,261 --> 01:40:36,766
And this is one transaction
between us and the two of you.

1561
01:40:36,799 --> 01:40:38,234
We're not trying to do
two things here, sir.

1562
01:40:38,267 --> 01:40:39,969
We're just doing one thing.
One, one, one.

1563
01:40:40,003 --> 01:40:45,074
It's hard for me to see how the
Republic of East German Democrats is being slighted.

1564
01:40:45,108 --> 01:40:47,977
You agreed with the Soviets
without consulting me.

1565
01:40:48,011 --> 01:40:49,946
Is this a negotiation
or a conspiracy?

1566
01:40:49,979 --> 01:40:50,880
For it to be
a conspiracy,

1567
01:40:50,913 --> 01:40:52,081
there would have to be
harm to you, sir.

1568
01:40:52,115 --> 01:40:55,051
There's just benefits here.
We're of agreeing interests.

1569
01:40:55,084 --> 01:40:57,020
No, you decide
they agree.

1570
01:40:58,021 --> 01:40:59,756
Where is your
appointment, sir?

1571
01:40:59,789 --> 01:41:01,190
In the West.
Ku'damm.

1572
01:41:01,224 --> 01:41:02,224
Good.

1573
01:41:13,369 --> 01:41:14,537
Look around you.

1574
01:41:14,570 --> 01:41:18,074
How does the Eastern sector
compare with the West? Hmm?

1575
01:41:20,109 --> 01:41:22,078
Our Russian friends
have decided that

1576
01:41:22,111 --> 01:41:24,047
we should not rebuild
our capital city.

1577
01:41:26,315 --> 01:41:29,819
But we live in this ruin
made by our Russian friends.

1578
01:41:29,852 --> 01:41:31,821
Go ahead, make your deal
with these Russians.

1579
01:41:31,854 --> 01:41:33,022
We won't be part of it.

1580
01:41:35,124 --> 01:41:36,325
There is no deal
without Pryor.

1581
01:41:36,359 --> 01:41:37,326
We are not
leaving him here.

1582
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:39,362
Is this your position
or your government's?

1583
01:41:39,395 --> 01:41:43,166
Sir, I'm here.
I'm talking to you.

1584
01:41:43,199 --> 01:41:45,134
But you are not a representative
of your government.

1585
01:41:45,168 --> 01:41:47,870
You don't know who you are.
Neither do we.

1586
01:41:47,904 --> 01:41:50,206
You should be careful.
This is not Brooklyn, Mr. Donovan.

1587
01:41:57,880 --> 01:41:59,282
Look, sir.

1588
01:41:59,315 --> 01:42:01,150
You must know that
in every respect that matters,

1589
01:42:01,184 --> 01:42:03,352
I represent
my government.

1590
01:42:03,386 --> 01:42:04,887
You know who I am.

1591
01:42:06,022 --> 01:42:07,056
Do I?

1592
01:42:13,029 --> 01:42:14,831
Uh-oh.

1593
01:42:29,145 --> 01:42:31,981
Do you have
the proper papers?

1594
01:42:32,014 --> 01:42:34,884
Of course not.
It doesn't matter.

1595
01:42:34,917 --> 01:42:36,085
An American lawyer
like you

1596
01:42:36,119 --> 01:42:37,887
can talk your way
out of anything.

1597
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:39,122
Can't you?

1598
01:43:21,931 --> 01:43:23,866
You go with him.

1599
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:26,402
Why?
It's passport problem.

1600
01:43:26,435 --> 01:43:28,004
What... What problem?
What's the problem?

1601
01:43:28,037 --> 01:43:29,238
You go with him.

1602
01:43:32,141 --> 01:43:33,476
And remember,

1603
01:43:33,509 --> 01:43:35,278
we control the fate
of Frederic Pryor.

1604
01:45:20,149 --> 01:45:21,284
My God!

1605
01:45:56,819 --> 01:45:59,255
Yeah,
I'll start with some coffee, please.

1606
01:45:59,288 --> 01:46:01,457
Then I'll have
the Hilton combo

1607
01:46:01,490 --> 01:46:03,326
and the American
breakfast.

1608
01:46:03,359 --> 01:46:04,460
And coffee.

1609
01:46:04,493 --> 01:46:05,561
Both breakfasts?

1610
01:46:05,594 --> 01:46:07,129
Yeah, yeah.

1611
01:46:07,163 --> 01:46:08,364
One first or...

1612
01:46:08,397 --> 01:46:10,099
Both first, both.
Whenever they're ready.

1613
01:46:10,132 --> 01:46:12,101
And coffee.
Hmm.

1614
01:46:29,685 --> 01:46:31,454
You shouldn't be here.

1615
01:46:31,487 --> 01:46:32,655
Well, sometimes
in Germany,

1616
01:46:32,688 --> 01:46:34,557
you just want a big
American breakfast.

1617
01:46:38,627 --> 01:46:40,663
What happened?
Where were you last night?

1618
01:46:40,696 --> 01:46:43,666
Vogel arranged for me
to spend some time in the East.

1619
01:46:43,699 --> 01:46:45,267
Oh, Jesus.

1620
01:46:45,301 --> 01:46:46,535
Frankly, it's not
that much worse

1621
01:46:46,569 --> 01:46:48,404
than where you have me
here in the West.

1622
01:46:50,473 --> 01:46:54,143
So the Russians are fine
with the exchange,

1623
01:46:54,176 --> 01:46:56,679
but now Vogel is saying
that the East Germans won't do it.

1624
01:46:56,712 --> 01:46:57,712
We're not gonna
get Pryor.

1625
01:46:59,115 --> 01:47:01,117
Great, good.

1626
01:47:01,150 --> 01:47:03,152
So the Soviets are set.
We get Powers.

1627
01:47:03,185 --> 01:47:04,453
We get Powers.

1628
01:47:04,487 --> 01:47:06,489
Well done.

1629
01:47:06,522 --> 01:47:08,557
No, the East Germans
won't do it.

1630
01:47:08,591 --> 01:47:10,693
We won't get Pryor,
and that kid matters.

1631
01:47:10,726 --> 01:47:12,428
Every person matters.

1632
01:47:12,461 --> 01:47:15,498
Sure, that's why you tried.
That's why you tried.

1633
01:47:15,531 --> 01:47:17,566
Abel's on his way,
so we're all set for tomorrow morning.

1634
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:20,169
Wait a minute.
Makes things simple.
Makes things simple.

1635
01:47:20,202 --> 01:47:22,471
We are not
getting the kid.

1636
01:47:22,505 --> 01:47:24,640
Yeah, I understand.
We're set.

1637
01:47:24,673 --> 01:47:26,473
We can ignore the message
we got this morning.

1638
01:47:28,277 --> 01:47:29,512
What message?

1639
01:47:29,545 --> 01:47:30,679
From the East Germans.

1640
01:47:30,713 --> 01:47:32,648
They called the number
I gave you.

1641
01:47:32,681 --> 01:47:35,184
They said they wanted
to speak to you today.

1642
01:47:35,217 --> 01:47:37,186
Vogel called?
No, um...

1643
01:47:37,219 --> 01:47:39,555
Office of, uh,
Harald Ott,

1644
01:47:39,588 --> 01:47:41,157
East German
attorney general.

1645
01:47:41,190 --> 01:47:42,658
Wanting what?
What does he want?

1646
01:47:42,691 --> 01:47:43,793
Well, to talk to you.

1647
01:47:43,826 --> 01:47:46,729
But it's okay,
I can't ask you to go back there.

1648
01:47:46,762 --> 01:47:49,365
And listen, you seem to be
persona non grata to some elements,

1649
01:47:49,398 --> 01:47:50,699
so we won't
push our luck.

1650
01:47:50,733 --> 01:47:52,735
So he wants to see me.

1651
01:47:52,768 --> 01:47:54,703
What time?

1652
01:47:54,737 --> 01:47:57,673
Oh, no, no. Now, listen.

1653
01:47:57,706 --> 01:47:59,742
You don't need to go.
In fact, you shouldn't go.

1654
01:47:59,775 --> 01:48:02,211
In fact, you can't go.

1655
01:48:02,244 --> 01:48:04,580
We're set with the Soviets.
We don't want to screw it up.

1656
01:48:04,613 --> 01:48:06,549
I'm not gonna screw it up.
You're not going!

1657
01:48:06,582 --> 01:48:08,150
Don't be a pain in the ass.

1658
01:48:08,184 --> 01:48:09,552
Oh, I ordered.

1659
01:48:09,585 --> 01:48:11,654
Enjoy your big
American breakfast.

1660
01:48:21,397 --> 01:48:23,332
I thought it should
be negotiated

1661
01:48:23,365 --> 01:48:25,568
at the highest level
as a courtesy to you.

1662
01:48:25,601 --> 01:48:27,403
I thank you, sir.

1663
01:48:29,638 --> 01:48:32,508
I don't know how things
became so confused.

1664
01:48:32,541 --> 01:48:35,344
Well, I guess sometimes
they just do.

1665
01:48:39,815 --> 01:48:41,417
For sake of clarity,

1666
01:48:41,450 --> 01:48:43,786
I say we are fully
prepared to exchange

1667
01:48:43,819 --> 01:48:48,524
the so-called student, Pryor,
for Rudolf Abel.

1668
01:48:48,557 --> 01:48:51,393
I understand from Mr. Vogel
that Pryor is very important to you.

1669
01:48:51,427 --> 01:48:52,795
Yes, but...

1670
01:48:52,828 --> 01:48:55,397
Ah, we'll do a memorandum
to that effect.

1671
01:48:56,765 --> 01:48:58,701
Oh, a memorandum.

1672
01:48:58,734 --> 01:49:02,204
Certainly, we commit
to a bi-lateral exchange.

1673
01:49:03,739 --> 01:49:08,277
Yes, yes, sure. I'm not sure
what that means but...

1674
01:49:08,310 --> 01:49:12,681
My country also insists
on Francis Gary Powers.

1675
01:49:12,715 --> 01:49:13,782
No!

1676
01:49:18,854 --> 01:49:22,525
This is how things
became so confused.

1677
01:49:22,558 --> 01:49:25,294
Powers. What use
is he, sir?

1678
01:49:25,327 --> 01:49:27,229
You want him back for
punitive reasons?

1679
01:49:27,263 --> 01:49:28,464
What's done is done.

1680
01:49:28,497 --> 01:49:29,798
He has divulged
what he will divulge,

1681
01:49:29,832 --> 01:49:32,635
as no doubt
Abel has also.

1682
01:49:32,668 --> 01:49:37,439
We are offering instead
someone who you insist is innocent.

1683
01:49:37,473 --> 01:49:38,774
And this is right.

1684
01:49:38,807 --> 01:49:40,442
This is who
you should retrieve.

1685
01:49:40,876 --> 01:49:42,511
The future.

1686
01:49:42,545 --> 01:49:43,905
Look to the future.

1687
01:49:47,483 --> 01:49:48,551
Ott.

1688
01:49:51,387 --> 01:49:53,389
Ott.

1689
01:50:01,764 --> 01:50:03,766
I'm sorry. If you could
give me a moment, sir.

1690
01:50:23,752 --> 01:50:25,888
I'm very sorry, sir.
The attorney general regrets

1691
01:50:25,921 --> 01:50:28,591
that he had to leave
on urgent business.

1692
01:50:28,624 --> 01:50:31,860
He left?
Yes. Many apologies.

1693
01:50:31,894 --> 01:50:34,296
I've been waiting
for over an hour.

1694
01:50:34,330 --> 01:50:35,664
Very sorry, sir.

1695
01:50:37,900 --> 01:50:39,401
Young man.

1696
01:50:41,537 --> 01:50:42,638
Come here.

1697
01:50:44,406 --> 01:50:45,841
It's all right.
Come here.

1698
01:50:51,380 --> 01:50:53,616
Uh...
Take a seat.

1699
01:50:55,684 --> 01:50:57,653
Oh, come on, come on.
Sit down.

1700
01:51:01,824 --> 01:51:03,559
Do you like
your job here?

1701
01:51:04,426 --> 01:51:05,794
It's a very
good job, sir.

1702
01:51:05,828 --> 01:51:07,930
It must be.
Must be interesting.

1703
01:51:07,963 --> 01:51:09,398
Oh, yes, sir.

1704
01:51:09,431 --> 01:51:11,533
And important, too.

1705
01:51:11,567 --> 01:51:14,536
And your English is...
Is good.

1706
01:51:14,570 --> 01:51:16,572
Yes, I hesitate to say
it's excellent.

1707
01:51:16,605 --> 01:51:17,473
But it's excellent,
sir.

1708
01:51:17,506 --> 01:51:19,541
Good, good.
Good.

1709
01:51:19,575 --> 01:51:22,478
See, I just lost my
negotiating partner,

1710
01:51:22,511 --> 01:51:24,546
and I need
somebody to talk to,

1711
01:51:24,580 --> 01:51:26,515
and you seem like
a reasonable young man.

1712
01:51:27,816 --> 01:51:29,451
Can I talk to you?

1713
01:51:30,786 --> 01:51:31,786
Uh...

1714
01:51:32,621 --> 01:51:33,856
It's all right.

1715
01:51:33,889 --> 01:51:35,658
It's all right.
I just...

1716
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:39,828
I just need you to give
a message to your boss.

1717
01:51:42,398 --> 01:51:43,958
But it has to be
very, very, very clear.

1718
01:51:45,434 --> 01:51:46,502
You understand?

1719
01:51:47,770 --> 01:51:50,906
Yes, sir. But perhaps
you should wait until he...

1720
01:51:50,939 --> 01:51:54,410
No, no. The thing is,
I have this cold and I wanna get home

1721
01:51:54,943 --> 01:51:56,812
and get in bed.

1722
01:51:58,580 --> 01:51:59,982
Can you give him
the message?

1723
01:52:00,015 --> 01:52:01,417
Certainly.

1724
01:52:03,419 --> 01:52:04,687
Well, this is
the message.

1725
01:52:06,755 --> 01:52:09,425
"There is no deal for
Abel unless we get Powers and Pryor."

1726
01:52:10,959 --> 01:52:13,429
Do you understand?
Yes, sir.

1727
01:52:13,462 --> 01:52:14,630
It's arranged for
tomorrow morning.

1728
01:52:14,663 --> 01:52:16,999
It will not happen
unless we get two men.

1729
01:52:17,032 --> 01:52:18,734
Those two men.

1730
01:52:18,767 --> 01:52:20,436
Two, two, two.
Yes, sir.

1731
01:52:21,036 --> 01:52:23,806
If there is no deal,

1732
01:52:23,839 --> 01:52:25,474
your boss must tell
the Soviets.

1733
01:52:27,009 --> 01:52:28,744
He has to tell
the Soviets

1734
01:52:28,777 --> 01:52:30,813
that they are not
getting Rudolf Abel.

1735
01:52:33,015 --> 01:52:34,717
Yes, sir.

1736
01:52:37,653 --> 01:52:38,921
Oh, and tell him this.

1737
01:52:40,689 --> 01:52:43,659
That so far, Abel has been
a good soldier,

1738
01:52:43,692 --> 01:52:45,761
but he thinks
he's going home.

1739
01:52:47,963 --> 01:52:50,566
If we had to tell him
that he's not going home,

1740
01:52:50,599 --> 01:52:51,867
that the Soviets
don't even want him,

1741
01:52:51,900 --> 01:52:53,502
that he's never
going home...

1742
01:52:53,535 --> 01:52:55,671
Well, I imagine his
behavior might change.

1743
01:52:57,740 --> 01:53:00,609
And who will be held
responsible for that?

1744
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:05,681
That's a long message.

1745
01:53:05,714 --> 01:53:07,750
Uh, did you get it all?

1746
01:53:07,783 --> 01:53:09,952
Yes, sir. Got it.
Good.

1747
01:53:11,620 --> 01:53:12,755
You're a good man.

1748
01:53:13,822 --> 01:53:14,823
Oh...

1749
01:53:15,724 --> 01:53:17,459
And also tell him

1750
01:53:17,493 --> 01:53:18,660
there's no deal
unless we hear

1751
01:53:18,694 --> 01:53:20,529
before the end of
business today.

1752
01:53:20,562 --> 01:53:21,830
He has the number.

1753
01:53:21,864 --> 01:53:23,866
If the exchange
isn't gonna happen,

1754
01:53:23,899 --> 01:53:25,934
no reason for everybody
to get up first thing in the morning.

1755
01:53:25,968 --> 01:53:29,671
No, sir,
that would be pointless.

1756
01:53:29,705 --> 01:53:32,508
You're kidding me!
You're kidding me!

1757
01:53:32,541 --> 01:53:34,710
Not really.
I need some change.

1758
01:53:34,743 --> 01:53:36,979
This is exactly
what you weren't supposed to do.

1759
01:53:37,012 --> 01:53:39,815
My instructions were
to feel out the situation.

1760
01:53:39,848 --> 01:53:42,651
Your instructions
were to get Powers, not Pryor.

1761
01:53:42,684 --> 01:53:44,920
That was not the original deal.
You fouled it all up!

1762
01:53:44,953 --> 01:53:47,589
How do you know?
I feel pretty good about it.

1763
01:53:47,623 --> 01:53:48,991
You fucked it all up!

1764
01:53:49,024 --> 01:53:50,826
Oh, don't worry.

1765
01:53:50,859 --> 01:53:52,961
I think it's
gonna be fine.

1766
01:53:52,995 --> 01:53:54,730
How do you know?
You don't know that.

1767
01:53:58,867 --> 01:54:00,969
United States.
New York, New York.

1768
01:54:01,003 --> 01:54:02,538
<i>Danke.</i>

1769
01:54:03,605 --> 01:54:06,575
Look, this whole thing

1770
01:54:06,608 --> 01:54:09,511
has been to feel me out.

1771
01:54:09,545 --> 01:54:11,847
Would I swap one for one
and which one?

1772
01:54:12,915 --> 01:54:14,883
But I said
"No, two for one."

1773
01:54:14,917 --> 01:54:16,852
So they know
where we stand.

1774
01:54:16,885 --> 01:54:18,921
Yeah, what if they think
about it and say, uh...

1775
01:54:18,954 --> 01:54:21,089
"Forget it! You keep our guy,
we keep your guys"?

1776
01:54:24,026 --> 01:54:26,128
Well, then I have
fucked it all up.

1777
01:54:26,161 --> 01:54:28,664
Hey, honey! It's me.

1778
01:54:28,697 --> 01:54:31,567
Yeah. The fishing's
been great.

1779
01:54:33,569 --> 01:54:34,903
I'm in London,

1780
01:54:34,937 --> 01:54:36,937
just for one more meeting,
then I'm on my way home.

1781
01:54:38,173 --> 01:54:41,643
Yeah, yeah, I remember
that marmalade.

1782
01:54:41,677 --> 01:54:43,779
It's that shop
right by Regent's Park.

1783
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:47,015
All right, I will
if I have the time.

1784
01:54:47,049 --> 01:54:48,817
Hey, can I say
hi to Roger?

1785
01:54:50,052 --> 01:54:51,720
Could I say hi
to the girls?

1786
01:54:52,654 --> 01:54:53,789
Is anyone not busy?

1787
01:54:55,023 --> 01:54:57,526
Have they even noticed
I'm not around?

1788
01:55:53,815 --> 01:55:54,950
We're on.

1789
01:55:56,051 --> 01:55:57,653
Two for one.

1790
01:55:58,720 --> 01:56:00,689
Hot dog.

1791
01:56:00,722 --> 01:56:02,858
Let's have a drink.

1792
01:56:02,891 --> 01:56:05,627
One wrinkle.
What is that?

1793
01:56:05,661 --> 01:56:08,130
They won't release
Pryor with Powers, not at the bridge.

1794
01:56:08,163 --> 01:56:09,898
They'll release him
at the same time.

1795
01:56:09,932 --> 01:56:12,034
When the Russians give us
Powers on the bridge,

1796
01:56:12,067 --> 01:56:14,703
they'll release Pryor
over Checkpoint Charlie.

1797
01:56:14,736 --> 01:56:16,238
What does that mean?

1798
01:56:16,271 --> 01:56:19,741
I think it means,
"We wanna have the last word."

1799
01:56:20,776 --> 01:56:21,777
But they will do it.

1800
01:56:22,878 --> 01:56:24,079
You tell me.
You felt them out.

1801
01:56:45,167 --> 01:56:46,768
Where are they?

1802
01:56:46,802 --> 01:56:48,136
Where's our guy?
Where's our guy?

1803
01:56:48,170 --> 01:56:49,771
They're late.

1804
01:56:49,805 --> 01:56:51,740
Nobody's late.
We're early.

1805
01:56:51,773 --> 01:56:53,208
May I?
Yeah.

1806
01:57:00,182 --> 01:57:01,249
Hoffman.

1807
01:57:01,283 --> 01:57:02,818
Yeah?

1808
01:57:02,851 --> 01:57:04,286
I think they have...

1809
01:57:04,319 --> 01:57:06,054
What?

1810
01:57:06,088 --> 01:57:07,956
...snipers.

1811
01:57:07,990 --> 01:57:09,257
Well,
I'm sure they do.

1812
01:57:10,158 --> 01:57:11,860
How are you
sure they do?

1813
01:57:12,327 --> 01:57:14,129
Because we have snipers.

1814
01:57:31,947 --> 01:57:33,081
Step out, sir.

1815
01:57:41,356 --> 01:57:42,791
Jim.

1816
01:57:47,029 --> 01:57:48,029
Dear Jim.

1817
01:57:50,065 --> 01:57:51,967
How are you?

1818
01:57:52,834 --> 01:57:55,003
Happy to see you.

1819
01:57:55,037 --> 01:57:56,972
Have you arranged
all this for me?

1820
01:57:57,005 --> 01:57:59,808
Well, let's see what this is before I...
I take credit for it.

1821
01:58:01,109 --> 01:58:03,045
Any word about Pryor
from Checkpoint Charlie?

1822
01:58:27,402 --> 01:58:29,104
Nothing cooking yet.

1823
01:58:35,844 --> 01:58:37,145
Excuse me, sir.

1824
01:58:37,179 --> 01:58:39,314
This is Lieutenant Joe Murphy,
United States Air Force,

1825
01:58:39,347 --> 01:58:41,083
here to identify Powers.

1826
01:58:41,850 --> 01:58:42,918
Lieutenant Murphy.

1827
01:58:43,351 --> 01:58:44,853
Sir.

1828
01:58:48,023 --> 01:58:49,825
There may be
a slight glitch.

1829
01:58:49,858 --> 01:58:51,993
I was a young man
when I left.

1830
01:58:52,027 --> 01:58:54,062
Who will they find
to identify me?

1831
01:58:55,297 --> 01:58:58,033
Well, I hope it's not your
East German family.

1832
01:58:58,066 --> 01:58:59,901
I doubt they could
identify each other.

1833
01:59:35,070 --> 01:59:36,271
Looks like our party.

1834
01:59:44,112 --> 01:59:46,414
Well, let's go.

1835
01:59:46,448 --> 01:59:48,116
You can stay here,
Donovan.

1836
01:59:49,251 --> 01:59:50,385
Not likely.

1837
01:59:52,954 --> 01:59:54,122
Open the gate.

1838
02:00:09,171 --> 02:00:11,139
What do you think will happen
when you get home?

1839
02:00:11,907 --> 02:00:13,208
Uh, I think...

1840
02:00:14,242 --> 02:00:16,178
I'll have a vodka.

1841
02:00:19,014 --> 02:00:20,081
Yeah.

1842
02:00:20,982 --> 02:00:22,250
Yeah.

1843
02:00:22,284 --> 02:00:25,086
But, Rudolf, is there
not the possibility...

1844
02:00:25,120 --> 02:00:27,189
That my people
are going to shoot me?

1845
02:00:28,390 --> 02:00:29,424
Yes.

1846
02:00:31,226 --> 02:00:33,295
You're not worried?
Would it help?

1847
02:00:45,440 --> 02:00:48,410
To answer your question,
my friend,

1848
02:00:48,443 --> 02:00:51,012
I acted honorably.
I think they know that.

1849
02:00:52,314 --> 02:00:54,182
But sometimes
people think wrong.

1850
02:00:54,216 --> 02:00:55,417
People are people.

1851
02:00:57,152 --> 02:00:58,486
Let's see how they
greet me.

1852
02:01:00,355 --> 02:01:01,990
What can I look for?

1853
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:08,463
If I'm embraced or just
shown the back seat.

1854
02:01:49,204 --> 02:01:50,338
<i>Da.</i>

1855
02:02:03,151 --> 02:02:04,519
Take off the hat.

1856
02:02:11,092 --> 02:02:12,294
Hey, Powers.

1857
02:02:14,095 --> 02:02:15,363
Hey, Murph.

1858
02:02:17,232 --> 02:02:18,466
Yeah, that's Powers.

1859
02:02:21,303 --> 02:02:23,505
All right,
Mr. Donovan. We go now!

1860
02:02:23,538 --> 02:02:25,006
Hang on.

1861
02:02:32,280 --> 02:02:33,581
Believe me,
I will tell you.

1862
02:02:35,650 --> 02:02:37,185
There's no one here.

1863
02:02:40,522 --> 02:02:42,590
They're releasing another man
at Checkpoint Charlie.

1864
02:02:42,624 --> 02:02:44,626
We're just confirming
that he's there.

1865
02:02:44,659 --> 02:02:46,261
Now!

1866
02:02:46,294 --> 02:02:47,595
As per plan,
if you please.

1867
02:02:49,197 --> 02:02:50,632
Let's go.

1868
02:02:50,665 --> 02:02:53,501
Pryor will show up
or he won't. Let's go.

1869
02:02:53,535 --> 02:02:56,404
They're waiting to see
if we'll do it without him.

1870
02:02:56,438 --> 02:02:58,340
We just have to stand here,
show them we won't.

1871
02:03:00,141 --> 02:03:01,276
I don't give a shit
what they want.

1872
02:03:01,309 --> 02:03:03,611
We have our objective.
Go ahead, Abel.

1873
02:03:05,413 --> 02:03:08,283
Go ahead, sir.
You can go.

1874
02:03:08,316 --> 02:03:10,385
If it is not to plan,
we go home.

1875
02:03:10,418 --> 02:03:12,354
We exchange now
or we go home!

1876
02:03:15,156 --> 02:03:17,359
You're waiting for another man?
Yup.

1877
02:03:18,426 --> 02:03:20,028
You want him, too.

1878
02:03:22,097 --> 02:03:23,331
I want him.

1879
02:03:23,365 --> 02:03:24,532
Doesn't matter
what he wants, sir.

1880
02:03:24,566 --> 02:03:26,368
I'm in charge and
you are free to go.

1881
02:03:27,302 --> 02:03:29,070
Please go.
Walk across.

1882
02:03:40,715 --> 02:03:42,117
I can wait.

1883
02:04:07,208 --> 02:04:09,577
It's something.
I'm not sure yet.

1884
02:04:11,646 --> 02:04:12,680
Hang on!

1885
02:04:57,659 --> 02:04:58,659
Let's go.

1886
02:05:05,333 --> 02:05:06,434
We got him!

1887
02:05:07,535 --> 02:05:08,703
Uh, I, uh...

1888
02:05:11,339 --> 02:05:13,174
I sent you a gift, Jim.

1889
02:05:14,275 --> 02:05:15,743
It's a...
It's a painting.

1890
02:05:17,479 --> 02:05:19,514
I hope it has some
meaning to you.

1891
02:05:21,749 --> 02:05:23,718
I'm sorry. I didn't think
to get you a gift.

1892
02:05:27,489 --> 02:05:29,357
This is your gift.

1893
02:05:32,694 --> 02:05:34,229
This is your gift.

1894
02:06:09,631 --> 02:06:10,631
You okay?

1895
02:06:12,467 --> 02:06:13,587
Let's go, let's go,
let's go!

1896
02:07:33,548 --> 02:07:35,516
Mr. Donovan.

1897
02:07:35,550 --> 02:07:37,485
Colonel Abel asked me
to give this to you.

1898
02:07:40,421 --> 02:07:41,556
Pardon me, sir.

1899
02:07:43,391 --> 02:07:44,871
Were you in charge
of this thing, sir?

1900
02:07:46,361 --> 02:07:48,496
Yeah.
Well, I gotta thank you.

1901
02:07:49,397 --> 02:07:50,632
I gotta thank somebody.

1902
02:08:07,849 --> 02:08:10,652
I gave them nothing.
I gave them nothing.

1903
02:08:11,853 --> 02:08:13,788
It doesn't matter.

1904
02:08:13,821 --> 02:08:16,424
It doesn't matter
what people think.

1905
02:08:16,457 --> 02:08:17,525
You know
what you did.

1906
02:09:08,543 --> 02:09:09,711
Welcome home.

1907
02:09:11,946 --> 02:09:13,514
What a trip.

1908
02:09:18,586 --> 02:09:19,754
Mmm.

1909
02:09:23,024 --> 02:09:24,525
Mmm.

1910
02:09:24,959 --> 02:09:26,561
You okay?

1911
02:09:26,994 --> 02:09:28,663
Yeah, I'm fine.

1912
02:09:30,598 --> 02:09:32,600
Did you get the marmalade?
Yes, yes.

I'm sorry.
We were so busy.
Oh, for Pete's sake.

How's Roger?
Is he home?

Carol's home, Peggy's home.
Everyone's home.

1922
02:09:56,557 --> 02:09:58,693
Mom!
Come quick! Look!
