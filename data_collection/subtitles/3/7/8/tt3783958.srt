Same here. Was Jen there? Or Rachel?

- I do not know who Jen and Rachel are.
- They are the worst.

93
00:09:50,403 --> 00:09:53,604
- I don't know if they were there.
- I bet that they were.

94
00:09:53,637 --> 00:09:55,605
Why is there a convention
in the bathroom?

What?

100
00:10:03,665 --> 00:10:05,266
Did she just say "working"?

101
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:09,429
- What? 
- Sorry it didn't go well today.

102
00:10:09,462 --> 00:10:11,293
And there's like four things in my inbox...

It's not gonna be fun.

107
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,250
- It could be. 
- It's not.

108
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,129
It's gonna be a bunch of social climbers.

109
00:10:20,163 --> 00:10:22,898
All packed into one of those big glass houses.

110
00:10:22,932 --> 00:10:24,001
This looks familiar.

111
00:10:24,435 --> 00:10:26,846
- I was gonna give that back.
- How long have you had this?

112
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,480
- Come on Mia! 
- A long time.

113
00:10:28,903 --> 00:10:32,432
When else are you gonna get to see a 
very Hollywood cliche crammed into the same room?

114
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:33,639
We'll make fun of it together!

115
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:37,084

176
00:18:40,712 --> 00:18:41,712
Is it true?

177
00:18:41,765 --> 00:18:43,884
When are you going to unpack these boxes?

178
00:18:44,474 --> 00:18:46,289
When I unpack them in my own club.

179
00:18:46,323 --> 00:18:47,195
Oh, Sebastian!

180
00:18:47,228 --> 00:18:49,863
It's like a girl broke up with you and you're stalking her.

181
00:18:49,883 --> 00:18:51,488
You're not still going by there, are you?

182
00:18:52,136 --> 00:18:54,047
That's...

183
00:18:54,275 --> 00:18:56,623
I can't believe they turned it into
a samba-tapas place.

184
00:18:56,631 --> 00:18:59,354
- Oh my god, Sebastian! 
- Samba. Tapas.

185
00:19:00,335 --> 00:19:02,835
Pick one, you
know. Do one right.

186
00:19:02,868 --> 00:19:04,467
I have someone I want you to meet.

187
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:06,238
I don't want to meet anyone.

188
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:07,926
N-no, I don't want to meet anyone.

189
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:08,673
- Dad gave you this? 
- Yes.

190
00:19:08,762 --> 00:19:09,762
You'll like her.

191
00:19:10,553 --> 00:19:11,553
I don't think I'm gonna like her.

192
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:13,659
- Does she like jazz? 
- Probably not.

193
00:19:13,906 --> 00:19:15,828
- Then what are we gonna talk about?
- I dont know! It doesn't matter.

194
00:19:15,852 --> 00:19:16,670
Okay?

195
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,960
Because you're living like a hermit.
You're driving without insurance!

196
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,433
- Doesn't matter? - Yes. Doesn't matter.

197
00:19:21,457 --> 00:19:22,526
- Okay.
- You need to get serious.

198
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,451
Well then I know a guy with a face tattoo you should see.

199
00:19:24,475 --> 00:19:25,595
- Okay, low blow. 
- With a heart of gold.

200
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:28,587
- Get serious! 
- Get serious? Laura...

201
00:19:28,657 --> 00:19:32,428
- I... I had a very serious plan for my future.
- I know.

202
00:19:32,461 --> 00:19:34,527
It's not my fault I got Shanghaied.

203
00:19:34,592 --> 00:19:37,582
You didn't get Shanghaied. You got ripped off.

204
00:19:37,934 --> 00:19:39,001
What's the difference?

205
00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:41,233
I don't know. It's not as romantic as that.

206
00:19:42,326 --> 00:19:43,326
Don't sit...

207
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,785
Everybody knew that guy
was shady, except for you.

208
00:19:48,261 --> 00:19:50,329
Why do you say "romantic"...

209
00:19:50,362 --> 00:19:51,810
like it's a dirty word?

210
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,183
Unpaid bills are not romantic. Call her.

211
00:19:55,829 --> 00:19:56,829
I'm not going to call her.

212
00:19:57,124 --> 00:19:59,155
The thing is... You're acting like life's...

213
00:19:59,188 --> 00:20:00,518
got me on the ropes.

214
00:20:00,604 --> 00:20:02,625
I want to be on the ropes.

215
00:20:02,663 --> 00:20:03,895
Okay? I'm just - I'm letting life

216
00:20:03,918 --> 00:20:05,181
hit me until it gets tired.

217
00:20:05,822 --> 00:20:08,677
And then I'm gonna hit back. It's a
classic "rope-a-dope".

218
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,486
Okay, Ali. I love you.
Unpack your boxes.

219
00:20:13,722 --> 00:20:16,168
- I'm gonna change the locks.
- You can't afford it.

220
00:20:17,485 --> 00:20:20,190
I am a phoenix rising from the ashes.

221
00:20:23,876 --> 00:20:25,766


222
00:21:07,755 --> 00:21:10,438
- Hey.
- Hey Bill, thanks for letting me back.

223
00:21:10,588 --> 00:21:11,177
You're welcome.

224
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:12,648
I want you to know that you're looking at a new man.

225
00:21:12,672 --> 00:21:13,115
Good.

226
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:14,788
- A man that's happy to be here. 
- Excellent.

227
00:21:15,429 --> 00:21:18,474
- Very easy to work with.
- And you're gonna play the setlist?

228
00:21:18,509 --> 00:21:19,509
Happy to.

229
00:21:20,111 --> 00:21:21,910
Even though I don't think anybody cares what I play.

230
00:21:21,934 --> 00:21:22,525
But yeah.

231
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:24,658
Well, if by "anyone" you mean...

232
00:21:24,691 --> 00:21:26,526
anyone other than me, that would be correct.

233
00:21:26,556 --> 00:21:28,308
I care, and I don't
wanna hear the free jazz.

234
00:21:28,332 --> 00:21:30,252
Right. Okay.

235
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:34,924
Although I - I thought that in this town worked on a sort of
"one for you, one for me" type system.

236
00:21:35,904 --> 00:21:37,486
How about two for you, one for me?

237
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:40,961
How about all for you and none for me?

238
00:21:40,998 --> 00:21:42,263
- That's perfect! Yes. 
- Great.

239
00:21:42,271 --> 00:21:43,649
- Okay.
- Okay. Mutual decision.

240
00:21:44,024 --> 00:21:45,396
Right. Made- made by me.

241
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,688
Right. And I signed off on it so...

242
00:21:47,721 --> 00:21:49,615
Whatever. Tell yourself what you wanna know.

243
00:21:50,671 --> 00:21:52,365
Hello. Welcome back.

244
00:21:54,226 --> 00:21:55,929
There's a nice way to say that, Karen.

245
00:24:59,294 --> 00:25:00,320
Seb.

246
00:25:12,965 --> 00:25:14,814
I do- I do- I hear what you're saying.

247
00:25:14,896 --> 00:25:16,085
But I don't think you're saying what you mean.

248
00:25:16,109 --> 00:25:18,026
Yeah, I don't think you hear what I'm saying. You're fired.

249
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:20,833
Well I- That's what you're saying but 
that's not what you mean. You mean is..

250
00:25:21,366 --> 00:25:22,366
You're fired.

251
00:25:22,637 --> 00:25:23,938
... play the setlist.

252
00:25:24,671 --> 00:25:26,834
- No. What I'm saying is "too late".
- It is a warning.

253
00:25:27,136 --> 00:25:28,457
What- what planet are you from?

254
00:25:28,501 --> 00:25:31,053
- Don't fire me. Don't fire me. 
- You're done. I'm sorry, Seb.

255
00:25:31,794 --> 00:25:32,991
It's Christmas.

256
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,887
Yeah, I see the decorations. Good
luck in the New Year.

257
00:25:50,231 --> 00:25:52,634
I just heard you play, and I
wanted to...

258
00:26:06,903 --> 00:26:08,859
I don’t like the fissure on the GT scan.

259
00:26:09,461 --> 00:26:11,432
Did you test for achromatopsia?

260
00:26:11,786 --> 00:26:15,137
D.O.A. on 23rd, perp laughing 
his face off at the P.D. 

261
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:17,061
Damn Miranda Rights.

262
00:26:17,112 --> 00:26:18,942
This is my classroom.

263
00:26:19,118 --> 00:26:21,005
You don’t like it, the door’s to my left.

264
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,497
Lady why you be trippin’ like that?

265
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,508
No, Jamal.

266
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:28,172
You be trippin’.

267
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:37,549


268
00:26:37,748 --> 00:26:39,010


269
00:26:49,203 --> 00:26:50,321
Mia!

270
00:26:50,515 --> 00:26:52,177
- Hi! 
- Hi.

271
00:26:52,931 --> 00:26:54,691
I want you to meet my friend Carlo.

272
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:55,970
- Hi. Carlo. 
- This is Mia.

273
00:26:56,191 --> 00:26:57,332
- Nice. Mia? 
- Yes, Mia.

274
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,401
- Hi. How are you? 
- Carlo is a writer.

275
00:26:59,503 --> 00:27:01,213
Yeah. They say I have a knack for

276
00:27:01,247 --> 00:27:03,305
 world building. I got a lot of heat right now.

277
00:27:03,392 --> 00:27:05,705
It's from a lot of buzz, people talking about me. It's just exciting.

278
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:08,000
- You work so hard and then all of it validated... 
- I'm gonna go grab a drink.

279
00:27:08,024 --> 00:27:08,765
- Yeah.
- Okay.

280
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,385
- It's really nice to meet you.

281
00:27:31,786 --> 00:27:32,953
Sorry.

282
00:28:01,628 --> 00:28:04,334
Thank you. Any other requests?

283
00:28:07,673 --> 00:28:08,798
The girl in the front!

284
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:13,242
- 'I Ran'. 
- 'I Ran'. A fantastic suggestion!

285
00:28:14,204 --> 00:28:16,769
All right, piano man, tickle those ivories.
Let's hit it.

286
00:28:17,163 --> 00:28:18,910
One two three four!

287
00:28:30,265 --> 00:28:31,320
That's right!

288
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,801
<i>♪ I walk alone the avenue</i>

289
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:39,644
<i>♪ I never thought I'd meet a girl like you</i>

290
00:28:39,822 --> 00:28:43,196
- <i>♪ Meet a girl like you... </i>
- Me?

291
00:28:44,637 --> 00:28:47,797
<i>♪ With auburn hair and tawny eyes</i>

292
00:28:48,202 --> 00:28:52,602
<i>♪ The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through</i>

293
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:55,952
<i>♪ That hypnotize me through</i>

294
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:02,418
<i>♪ And I ran, I ran so far away</i>

295
00:29:02,566 --> 00:29:04,786
<i>♪ I couldn't get away</i>

296
00:29:30,189 --> 00:29:32,272
All right. I remember you.

297
00:29:32,338 --> 00:29:34,904
And I would admit I was a little curt that night.

298
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:35,600
"Curt"?

299 
00:29:35,676 --> 00:29:38,550
- Okay, I was an asshole. I can admit that.
- Okay.

300
00:29:38,769 --> 00:29:42,372
But requesting 'I Ran' from a serious musician is just- it's too far.

301
00:29:42,438 --> 00:29:45,796
My Lord! Did you just say "a serious musician"?

302
00:29:46,142 --> 00:29:46,897
I don't think so.

303
00:29:46,904 --> 00:29:48,701
- Can I borrow what you're wearing?
- Why?

304
00:29:48,778 --> 00:29:50,091
Because I have an audition next week.

305
00:29:50,115 --> 00:29:52,055
I'm playing a serious firefighter.

306
00:29:52,063 --> 00:29:55,078
So you're an actress. I thought you look familiar.
Have I seen you on anything?

307
00:29:56,971 --> 00:30:00,124
A coffee shop on the Warner Bros. lot. That's classic.

308
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:01,165
- Oh, I see. 
- Yeah.
 
309
00:30:01,198 --> 00:30:05,360
You're a barista. And I can see how you could 
then look down on me from all the way up there.

310
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:06,921
Next set.

311
00:30:08,452 --> 00:30:09,864
He doesn't... I don't...

312
00:30:10,668 --> 00:30:12,108
He doesn't tell me what to do.

313
00:30:12,431 --> 00:30:14,907
- He just told you what to...
- I know. I let him.

314
00:30:15,726 --> 00:30:17,736
- What is your name? Mia. 
- Mia.

315
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,320
I guess I'll see you in the movies.

316
00:30:23,804 --> 00:30:26,095
- You know Joseph Campbell?
- Yes.

317
00:30:26,176 --> 00:30:28,647
I have this idea that you were
reimagining "Goldilocks and the Three Bears"...

318
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,091
from the perspective of the bears.

319
00:30:30,542 --> 00:30:32,446
- You know it's thrilling.
- It could be a franchise.

320
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:32,937
Right.

321
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:35,143
So well we don't know if they were cooped up up there. We don't know.

322
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,279
George Michael!

323
00:30:42,206 --> 00:30:43,206
Hello.

324
00:30:43,268 --> 00:30:45,115
Sorry. It's - I know that guy.

325
00:30:45,675 --> 00:30:46,924
Did you get your keys?

326
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,876
- Yes. 
- Can you grab mine?

327
00:30:52,516 --> 00:30:54,941
- Sorry what? 
- Will you be able to grab my- my keys?

328
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,013
I can't hear you.

329
00:30:56,046 --> 00:30:57,875
- Sorry, can you grab my keys? 
- Oh.

330
00:30:58,981 --> 00:31:00,298
- Please. 
- Oh, there we go.

331
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:01,714
- Thank you. 
- You're welcome.

332
00:31:04,414 --> 00:31:06,022
- What kind?
- It's a Prius.

333
00:31:08,962 --> 00:31:11,490
- That does't help me.
- With a green ribbon.

334
00:31:12,517 --> 00:31:13,517
All right.

335
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:18,567
Those look, uh, comfortable.

336
00:31:19,188 --> 00:31:20,202
They are.

337
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,503
Thank you for saving the day back there.

338
00:31:26,086 --> 00:31:28,589
Well, you didn't really give me much of a choice.

339
00:31:29,807 --> 00:31:32,301
It's pretty strange that we keep running into each other.

340
00:31:33,109 --> 00:31:34,180
It is strange.

341
00:31:36,038 --> 00:31:37,042
Maybe it means something.

342
00:31:37,043 --> 00:31:38,323
- I doubt it.
- Yeah. I don't think so.

343
00:31:38,347 --> 00:31:39,565
Where's my car?!

344
00:31:40,761 --> 00:31:42,329
Put that thing to your chin.

345
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:43,897
- This? 
- Yeah.

346
00:31:45,276 --> 00:31:46,738
It makes your head into an antenna.

347
00:31:47,367 --> 00:31:49,560
I think it gives you cancer but you find your car faster.

348
00:31:49,584 --> 00:31:50,235
What?

349
00:31:50,336 --> 00:31:53,243
I mean you don't get to live as long but you get 
where you're going quicker so it all evens out.

350
00:31:53,276 --> 00:31:55,815
- That sounds terrible.
- Just a suggestion.

351
00:31:57,442 --> 00:31:59,224
You're a real...

352
00:31:59,325 --> 00:32:01,774
- What's the word am I looking for?
- Knight in shining armor.

353
00:32:01,842 --> 00:32:04,286
- Weirdo. That was the word.
- Okay.

354
00:32:11,743 --> 00:32:13,234
Not much to look at, huh?

355
00:32:14,292 --> 00:32:15,360
I've seen better.

356
00:32:23,866 --> 00:32:27,708

Hi, Greg.

383
00:36:21,507 --> 00:36:22,982
Hi. Oh, sorry I'm late.

384
00:36:23,722 --> 00:36:25,865
Yeah. Very soon. Okay. Bye.

385
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,500
- It's just right there.
- Just right here.

386
00:36:54,744 --> 00:36:55,744
Do you want a ride to your car?

387
00:36:57,588 --> 00:36:59,013
No, I'm just right up here.

388
00:37:02,355 --> 00:37:03,355
Good night.

389
00:37:10,089 --> 00:37:11,089
Good night.

390
00:38:23,822 --> 00:38:26,158
Excuse me. This is gluten free, right?

391
00:38:27,517 --> 00:38:29,037
- No 
- What?

392
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,368
I'd like a refund.

393
00:38:34,416 --> 00:38:36,739
Okay. Let me check it out.

394
00:38:38,513 --> 00:38:41,113
Mia, you're closing Friday.

395
00:38:42,109 --> 00:38:44,662
I can't close on Friday. I
have an audition, remember?

396
00:38:44,752 --> 00:38:46,800
Do I look like I care?
We schedule it.

397
00:38:47,712 --> 00:38:50,289
Oh and we need to have a little talk tomorrow, okay?

398
00:38:50,554 --> 00:38:53,024
- Fix your apron, please. 
- Okay.

399
00:38:58,332 --> 00:38:59,332
You again!

400
00:39:01,843 --> 00:39:02,843
What are you doing here?

401
00:39:02,887 --> 00:39:06,021
You know, just meetings and studio heads..

402
00:39:06,482 --> 00:39:07,522
How did you get on the lot?

403
00:39:08,365 --> 00:39:10,698
I basically just run past the guard gates.

404
00:39:11,092 --> 00:39:13,080
I think I have 20 minutes until they find me.

405
00:39:14,036 --> 00:39:16,568
- You have a break coming up, do you?
- I'm off in ten minutes.

406
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:20,449
Can I hide in the bathroom?

407
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:21,774
- Yes. 
- Okay.

408
00:39:23,835 --> 00:39:24,931
Sorry.

409
00:39:26,426 --> 00:39:28,226
I actually do have to check. I'm sorry.

410
00:39:32,531 --> 00:39:34,529
That's the window that Humphrey Bogart

411
00:39:34,563 --> 00:39:36,069
and Ingrid Bergman looked out of in Casablanca.

412
00:39:36,651 --> 00:39:37,229
- Wow.
- Yeah.

413
00:39:37,437 --> 00:39:39,620
I can't believe you work right across the street from there.

414
00:39:39,653 --> 00:39:40,872
- Yeah.
- That's amazing.

415
00:39:41,366 --> 00:39:44,130
What was you're, uh, you're Bogart's name?

416
00:39:45,171 --> 00:39:46,980
What's his name? Is it Greg?

417
00:39:47,557 --> 00:39:49,124
Yeah, Greg.

418
00:39:49,605 --> 00:39:52,280
Right. How long have you been...?

419
00:39:52,313 --> 00:39:54,164
We've been seeing each other for about a month.

420
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:55,292
That's great.

421
00:39:55,958 --> 00:39:58,840
It's sweet. Anyway, I
love being around this stuff.

422
00:39:58,874 --> 00:39:59,529
You know?

423
00:39:59,556 --> 00:40:02,149
I know what you mean. I get coffee 5 miles out of the way...

424
00:40:02,189 --> 00:40:04,504
- just so I can be near a jazz club.
- Really?

425
00:40:04,781 --> 00:40:06,181
Yeah, the Van Beek. Do you know it?

426
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:08,495
All the big swing bands used to play there.

427
00:40:08,528 --> 00:40:09,609
Count Basie, Chick Webb.

428
00:40:11,178 --> 00:40:12,693
Anyway, it's a samba-tapas place now...

429
00:40:12,717 --> 00:40:14,787
So...

430
00:40:15,065 --> 00:40:16,293
What's a samba-tapas place?

431
00:40:16,317 --> 00:40:18,669
You know, it's like a samba place where they serve tapas.

432
00:40:19,212 --> 00:40:22,033
- Oh.
- Yeah. So the joke's on... history?

433
00:40:22,384 --> 00:40:23,816
I dont know. That's L.A.

434
00:40:23,849 --> 00:40:26,939
They just - They worship everything and they value nothing.

435
00:40:27,693 --> 00:40:29,434
We're about to roll. Stop please guys.

436
00:40:31,183 --> 00:40:32,996
- You're rolling?
- Yeah.

437
00:40:33,588 --> 00:40:35,693
They shoot movies on my street all the time so no problem.

438
00:40:35,726 --> 00:40:36,411
- Come this way.
- Right.

439
00:40:36,448 --> 00:40:37,448
It's a lockdown.

440
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,447
- I love her! 
- And here we go.

441
00:40:40,545 --> 00:40:42,651
Hey, Mia. How did you get into this?

442
00:40:42,869 --> 00:40:44,994
- And... roll! 
- Get into what?

443
00:40:46,006 --> 00:40:48,090
- You know, movies, acting. 
- Action!

444
00:40:49,935 --> 00:40:51,756
- My aunt was an actress. 
- Oh, okay.

445
00:40:52,653 --> 00:40:54,373
She was in a traveling theatre company.

446
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:56,714
I grew up in Boulder City, Nevada.

447
00:40:57,421 --> 00:41:00,001
So across the street from my house, there was this little library..

448
00:41:00,034 --> 00:41:01,602
that had an old movies section.

449
00:41:01,685 --> 00:41:04,843
So she- she took me and spent an entire day

450
00:41:04,876 --> 00:41:06,333
watching all these old movies...

451
00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:10,878
like "Notorious", "Bringing
Up Baby," "Casablanca" and...

452
00:41:11,132 --> 00:41:13,081
- Cut it there! Cut! Check the tapes.

453
00:41:13,097 --> 00:41:14,961
- We can talk now. 
- She sounds incredible.

454
00:41:14,979 --> 00:41:18,160
She was incredible. And I would put on all these plays in my bedroom...

455
00:41:18,448 --> 00:41:21,324
and it would basically just she and I...

456
00:41:21,357 --> 00:41:23,446
reenacting the scenes from the movies.

457
00:41:24,093 --> 00:41:26,532
- And then I wrote my own plays. Yeah.
- Wow.

458
00:41:48,217 --> 00:41:49,217
I love it.

459
00:41:53,695 --> 00:41:56,789
So anyway, I left college after two years to come here.

460
00:41:56,822 --> 00:41:59,676
And my last audition was for a teen soap...

461
00:41:59,716 --> 00:42:01,919
pitched as Dangerous Minds meets The OC.

462
00:42:02,224 --> 00:42:05,527
So yeah, should've been a lawyer.

463
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:08,099
'Cause the world needs more lawyers.

464
00:42:08,957 --> 00:42:10,633
Doesn't need more actresses.

465
00:42:10,755 --> 00:42:11,996
You're not just an actress.

466
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,619
What do you mean "just an actress"?

467
00:42:13,643 --> 00:42:17,123
You said it yourself. You were a child
prodigy playwright.

468
00:42:17,156 --> 00:42:18,586
That is not what I said.

469
00:42:18,696 --> 00:42:20,798
Well, you're too modest to say it but it's true.

470
00:42:22,251 --> 00:42:23,907
So you could just write your own roles, you know.

471
00:42:23,965 --> 00:42:25,994
Write something that's as interesting as you are...

472
00:42:26,098 --> 00:42:28,994
- and you don't have to audition for this pishi kaka.
- Yeah.

473
00:42:29,232 --> 00:42:30,423
Look at Louis Armstrong, you know.

474
00:42:30,456 --> 00:42:33,149
He could have just played the marching band charts that he was given.

475
00:42:33,332 --> 00:42:35,943
- But he didn't do it. What did he do?
- What did he do?

476
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:37,499
He made history, didn't he?

477
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:41,296
Well, I'm gonna stop auditioning and
I'm gonna make history instead.

478
00:42:42,402 --> 00:42:44,598
Well, my work is done here.

479
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:47,961
I should probably tell you something now.

480
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,507
To get it out the way.

481
00:42:49,762 --> 00:42:51,013
I hate jazz.

482
00:42:53,565 --> 00:42:54,565
You okay?

483
00:42:54,737 --> 00:42:56,120
What do you mean you hate jazz?

484
00:42:56,821 --> 00:42:58,777
It just means that when I listen to it, I don't like it.

485
00:42:58,811 --> 00:43:01,331
Yeah but it's just a blanket statement that you don't like jazz.

486
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:03,341
What are you doing right now?

487
00:43:04,755 --> 00:43:05,820
Nothing.

488
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:25,084
You know, I just think that when people say that,

489
00:43:26,678 --> 00:43:27,920
you know, hate jazz..

490
00:43:29,562 --> 00:43:33,013
They just- they don't have context. They don't know where it comes from.

491
00:43:33,112 --> 00:43:34,112
You know?

492
00:43:34,288 --> 00:43:37,782
Jazz was born in a little flophouse in New Orleans...

493
00:43:37,868 --> 00:43:41,549
and just because people were crammed in there,
they spoke five different languages.

494
00:43:41,606 --> 00:43:42,627
They couldn't talk to each other.

495
00:43:42,651 --> 00:43:46,043
The only way that they could communicate
was with jazz.

496
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:47,760
You know, what about Kenny G?

497
00:43:49,465 --> 00:43:50,038
What?

498
00:43:50,071 --> 00:43:52,936
What about Kenny G? I mean, what about elevator music?

499
00:43:53,227 --> 00:43:55,672
You know, jazz music that I know.

500
00:43:55,705 --> 00:43:57,470
- What about it?
- From my life.

501
00:43:57,787 --> 00:44:00,176
I just- I mean find it relaxing.

502
00:44:00,209 --> 00:44:01,589
It's not relaxing. It's not.

503
00:44:01,623 --> 00:44:02,279
It's not!

504
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:04,028
Sidney Bechet shot somebody...

505
00:44:04,034 --> 00:44:05,678
because he told him he played a wrong note.

506
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:07,152
That's hardly relaxing.

507
00:44:07,216 --> 00:44:10,523
Where I grew up, there was this
station called KJAZZ 103.

508
00:44:11,189 --> 00:44:14,354
And people would just put on that station
when they had a cocktail party...

509
00:44:14,525 --> 00:44:15,525
Right.

510
00:44:15,555 --> 00:44:17,730
And everyone would just kind of talk over it.

511
00:44:18,187 --> 00:44:20,094
- I know. 
- Yes. It was..

512
00:44:20,128 --> 00:44:21,627
Okay, okay. So I think that that's...

513
00:44:21,651 --> 00:44:23,460
part of the problem is
that you can't hear it, you know.

514
00:44:23,484 --> 00:44:25,856
You have to see it, you have to see what's at stake.

515
00:44:25,861 --> 00:44:29,250
I mean, look at these fellas. Look
at the saxophonist right now.

516
00:44:29,283 --> 00:44:31,449
He just hijacked the song. He's on his own trail.

517
00:44:31,495 --> 00:44:34,865
Everyone of these guys are composing, rearranging, they're writing...

518
00:44:34,898 --> 00:44:36,840
and they're playing the melody. They're just...

519
00:44:36,878 --> 00:44:39,655
And now look, the trumpet player. He's got his own idea.

520
00:44:39,846 --> 00:44:43,320
It's so- it's conflict and it's compromise, and it's just...

521
00:44:44,405 --> 00:44:47,259
It's new every time. It's brand new every night.

522
00:44:47,374 --> 00:44:49,176
It's very, very exciting.

523
00:44:56,613 --> 00:44:57,667
And it's dying.

524
00:44:58,493 --> 00:45:01,446
It's dying, Mia. It's dying on the vine.

525
00:45:01,502 --> 00:45:04,423
And the world says, "Let it
die. It had its time".

526
00:45:04,973 --> 00:45:06,205
Well, not on my watch.

527
00:45:08,027 --> 00:45:09,027
What are you gonna do?

528
00:45:09,257 --> 00:45:10,736
I'll have my own club.

529
00:45:11,588 --> 00:45:12,983
- Really?
- Yes.

530
00:45:13,135 --> 00:45:16,118
We're gonna play whatever we
want, whenever we want...

531
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:20,220
however we want, as long as it's pure jazz.

532
00:45:21,415 --> 00:45:22,897
<i>Hi, this is Mia Dolan.</i>

533
00:45:23,464 --> 00:45:24,975
Yeah, I just missed a call.

534
00:45:32,568 --> 00:45:34,048
- I got a callback! 
- What?

535
00:45:34,826 --> 00:45:36,605
Come on! For what?

536
00:45:36,916 --> 00:45:40,457
For a TV show. The one I was telling you about. 

537
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:42,135
- The Dangerous Minds meets The OC?
- Yeah.

538
00:45:42,562 --> 00:45:44,538
- Congratulations! That's incredible!
- It's really exciting.

539
00:45:44,562 --> 00:45:46,851
- I feel like I said negative stuff about if before.
- What?

540
00:45:46,918 --> 00:45:48,705
It's like "Rebel Without a Cause" sort of.

541
00:45:49,711 --> 00:45:51,141
"I got the bullets!"

542
00:45:52,136 --> 00:45:53,136
Yes.

543
00:45:54,645 --> 00:45:56,325
- You've never seen it!
- I've never seen it.

544
00:45:56,485 --> 00:45:58,865
Oh my. You know it's playing in the Rialto.

545
00:45:58,985 --> 00:46:00,210
- Really?
- Yes.

546
00:46:00,381 --> 00:46:03,924
You should go. I mean, I- I can take you.

547
00:46:04,468 --> 00:46:05,822
- Okay.
- You know, for research.

548
00:46:05,832 --> 00:46:07,257
- For research. Yeah.
- Yeah.

549
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:08,290
Okay.

550
00:46:08,926 --> 00:46:10,629
Monday night, ten o'clock.

551
00:46:10,707 --> 00:46:12,157
- Yeah. Great. 
- Okay.

552
00:46:12,412 --> 00:46:13,757
For research.

553
00:46:56,607 --> 00:47:03,406
<i>♪ City of stars 
are you shining just for me?

554
00:47:06,515 --> 00:47:13,130

00:48:01,376 --> 00:48:03,216
- Stand there please. 
- Okay. Nice to meet you.

559
00:48:06,029 --> 00:48:08,382
- Hi. 
- Hi.

560
00:48:31,841 --> 00:48:33,829
- On your own time.
- Okay.

561
00:48:38,496 --> 00:48:39,631
Two options:

562
00:48:39,784 --> 00:48:42,616
You either follow my rules, or
follow my rules. Capisce?

563
00:48:42,649 --> 00:48:43,649
Thank you.

564
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:47,298
- Thanks.
- I could do it a different way.

565
00:48:47,369 --> 00:48:49,714
That's- that's fine. Thank you very much. Thank you.

566
00:48:58,146 --> 00:48:59,849
- That was fun. Thanks.
- Bye.

567
00:49:11,818 --> 00:49:13,910


568
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,237
Hey Mia.

569
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:33,330
- What? 
- Greg's here.

570
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:34,830
What do you mean...?

571
00:49:35,032 --> 00:49:37,315
Hey babe. Got a space out front.

572
00:49:38,083 --> 00:49:39,670
- Great!
- We should get going.

573
00:49:39,704 --> 00:49:41,256
My brother landed really early.

574
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:45,284
Did you forget?

575
00:49:45,318 --> 00:49:46,622
- Shit. 
- You forgot.

576
00:49:47,366 --> 00:49:48,459
That's tonight.

577
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:51,336
- That's okay. Yeah. You forgot.
- Yeah. Okay. All right.

578
00:49:51,419 --> 00:49:52,911
So then I'll just get changed.

579
00:49:52,953 --> 00:49:54,651
- Okay. Great.
- Okay. Great.

580
00:49:57,902 --> 00:50:00,166
Yeah, that's him. Hey, Josh. Yeah.

581
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:02,977
Just picking up Mia. We'll be there in like...

582
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:07,289
<i>But now we got this surround sound setup.</i>

583
00:50:07,477 --> 00:50:09,336
Oh, it's like being in a movie theater.

584
00:50:09,769 --> 00:50:11,471
Well, better than being in a theater, really.

585
00:50:11,495 --> 00:50:13,472
- I can't wait.
- You know theaters these days.

586
00:50:13,496 --> 00:50:15,189
- Yeah.
- They're so dirty.

587
00:50:15,222 --> 00:50:16,970
Yeah, I know. They smell bad.

588
00:50:17,041 --> 00:50:20,098
- And they're either too hot or too cold.
- I know, the quality has gone far and off.

589
00:50:20,231 --> 00:50:22,399
Oh, it's terrible and there's always people talking. 

590
00:50:22,432 --> 00:50:24,957
- Many people. 
- Oh it's...

591
00:50:24,996 --> 00:50:27,097
- I'm sorry. Just- hold on a second.

592
00:50:28,466 --> 00:50:30,506
- Hello? 
- It's probably work.

593
00:50:36,553 --> 00:50:38,734
Sorry. So you know, we love it.

594
00:50:38,997 --> 00:50:40,784
- It's so nice.
- Well you have to come.

595
00:50:41,083 --> 00:50:42,824
You should come by.

596
00:51:01,038 --> 00:51:04,314
I have one more for you man: Indonesia.

597
00:51:04,593 --> 00:51:06,213
I don't know. I never heard anyone say that.

598
00:51:06,246 --> 00:51:09,258
I know, you know I can't even keep track of it but honestly, 
it was just life changing.

599
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:10,316
- Really.
- Yeah.

600
00:51:11,699 --> 00:51:13,506
- Is it amazing?

601
00:51:13,997 --> 00:51:16,292
- Yes. 
- A five-star jungle-eco resort.

602
00:51:16,976 --> 00:51:18,211
- Well, you would not believe.
- Amazing.

603
00:51:18,244 --> 00:51:19,921
We were thinking about going to Nicaragua.

604
00:51:19,955 --> 00:51:21,751
I think Nicaragua is less developed.

605
00:51:21,785 --> 00:51:23,205
- It's a bit underdeveloped. 
- Right.

606
00:51:23,909 --> 00:51:27,562
- It's a little more.
- I just- I don't know- I don't know if it's safe there.

607
00:51:27,595 --> 00:51:30,554
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I don't know if it's safe.

608
00:52:00,651 --> 00:52:02,058
I'm sorry!

609
00:54:31,033 --> 00:54:32,520
I have an idea.

610
00:55:08,111 --> 00:55:10,408


611
00:58:53,129 --> 00:58:56,001


612
00:59:07,806 --> 00:59:09,864
What is that? Is that a script?

613
00:59:09,899 --> 00:59:11,923
- It's a play. 
- A play?

614
00:59:12,323 --> 00:59:14,204
<i>You better give us all roles!</i>

615
00:59:14,238 --> 00:59:15,969
Actually, it's a one woman show.

616
00:59:16,603 --> 00:59:17,884
So I can't.

617
00:59:23,421 --> 00:59:25,418
Wow. Is that gonna happen everytime?

618
00:59:25,718 --> 00:59:27,070
I think so.

619
00:59:42,448 --> 00:59:44,126
<i>Wait! It's one way.</i>

620
00:59:49,484 --> 00:59:51,740


621
01:02:05,501 --> 01:02:07,227


622
01:02:21,792 --> 01:02:22,965
Sebastian!

623
01:02:26,814 --> 01:02:29,425
- Keith. 
- Come here, man.

624
01:02:31,262 --> 01:02:32,955
- How are you? 
- Very good, man.

625
01:02:32,989 --> 01:02:35,082
This is Mia. Mia, Keith.

626
01:02:35,182 --> 01:02:37,163
- Hi Mia. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

627
01:02:37,187 --> 01:02:38,445
I used to play with this guy.

628
01:02:38,754 --> 01:02:40,151
We went to school together.

629
01:02:40,485 --> 01:02:42,326
- So how you been brother?
- Great.

630
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:43,868
Never been better. How about you?

631
01:02:43,902 --> 01:02:45,542
I've been really good. Been very busy.

632
01:02:45,576 --> 01:02:47,225
- I got a new combo. 
- Okay.

633
01:02:47,759 --> 01:02:48,442
Cool.

634
01:02:48,476 --> 01:02:49,794
We're looking for keys.

635
01:02:51,042 --> 01:02:53,076
- Are you kidding me? 
- No, I'm not kidding.

636
01:02:53,676 --> 01:02:55,917
- No, I'm good.
- You sure? It pays.

637
01:02:57,042 --> 01:02:58,042
I'm good.

638
01:02:58,375 --> 01:02:59,942
Let's just grab a drink then.

639
01:02:59,976 --> 01:03:00,729
It's been too long.

640
01:03:00,772 --> 01:03:03,215
- Okay. Nice to meet you Mia. 
- Nice to meet you.

641
01:03:13,413 --> 01:03:14,856
The end.

642
01:03:16,741 --> 01:03:18,366
It's...

643
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:20,805
Genius!

644
01:03:21,574 --> 01:03:23,404
- Really?
- Yes.

645
01:03:23,438 --> 01:03:25,006
It feels really nostalgic to me.

646
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,182
- That's the point.
- Is it too nostalgic?

647
01:03:26,199 --> 01:03:27,719
- That's... 
- Are people gonna like it?

648
01:03:28,777 --> 01:03:29,777
Fuck 'em!

649
01:03:30,492 --> 01:03:33,397
- You always say that. 
- Well, I truly believe that.

650
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:35,944
- I made you something. 
- For what?

651
01:03:36,468 --> 01:03:37,922
For your club.

652
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:41,504
Why does it say "Seb's"?

653
01:03:41,537 --> 01:03:42,925
'Cause I think you should call it "Seb's".

654
01:03:42,949 --> 01:03:43,438
What?

655
01:03:43,471 --> 01:03:45,436
'Cause no one's gonna come to "Chicken on a Stick".

656
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:47,819
- Is that a music note? Is it an apostrophe?
- Yes.

657
01:03:47,854 --> 01:03:50,239
That's pretty cool. It's gotta be "Chicken on a Stick".

658
01:03:50,771 --> 01:03:53,393
Because Charlie Parker got his nickname...

659
01:03:53,426 --> 01:03:54,802
I know because he loves chicken.

660
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:57,774
That's why they call him "Bird".

661
01:03:58,591 --> 01:04:01,539
So I'm gonna have chicken, beer, jazz.
"Chicken on a Stick"

662
01:04:01,572 --> 01:04:03,201
I know.I think you should drop the chicken,

663
01:04:03,234 --> 01:04:04,488
and just have drinks and jazz, and...

664
01:04:04,772 --> 01:04:06,117
- also there could be...
- <i>I'm not dropping the chicken.</i>

665
01:04:06,129 --> 01:04:07,801
You could maybe do it somewhere else.

666
01:04:07,958 --> 01:04:09,687
Find a new spot?

667
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,297
- It's gotta be the Van Beek.
- It doesn't have to be the Van Beek.

668
01:04:12,330 --> 01:04:14,468
I can't let them samba all over its history.

669
01:04:15,194 --> 01:04:16,194
I can't do it.

670
01:04:16,824 --> 01:04:20,406
- You can let them but you refuse to.
- Your play's incredible.

671
01:04:21,757 --> 01:04:24,836
You know? The whole world from your bedroom.

672
01:04:26,065 --> 01:04:29,219
What else do they want? Who's doing that?

673
01:04:30,162 --> 01:04:31,625
- I'm doing that.
- You're doing that.

674
01:04:33,299 --> 01:04:34,819
Who was that guy in The Lighthouse?

675
01:04:36,478 --> 01:04:38,136
- The guy that offered you the gig?
- Keith.

676
01:04:38,526 --> 01:04:40,659
Yeah. Why was it so weird between you two?

677
01:04:40,692 --> 01:04:42,902
It's- it's just always weird with him.

678
01:04:42,935 --> 01:04:44,275
- Really?
- Yeah.

679
01:04:44,546 --> 01:04:47,668
But he seemed kinda nice because he did offer you a job.

680
01:04:48,773 --> 01:04:49,773
Are you gonna call him?

681
01:04:50,006 --> 01:04:53,781
- No. No.
- All right.

682
01:04:55,002 --> 01:04:56,387
So...

683
01:04:57,344 --> 01:04:59,100
- Here's what we know.
- Yeah.

684
01:05:00,188 --> 01:05:02,178
It's definitely "Chicken on a Stick"...

685
01:05:03,674 --> 01:05:05,593
and your play's gonna be a triumph.

686
01:05:08,761 --> 01:05:10,315
<i>It's a one woman show.</i>

687
01:05:10,349 --> 01:05:11,282
<i>So it's just me.</i>

688
01:05:11,315 --> 01:05:13,164
<i>No, I mean I'm acting in it.</i>

689
01:05:15,285 --> 01:05:18,992
<i>No, Mom, I'm not getting paid.
I'm paying to do it.</i>

690
01:05:21,138 --> 01:05:25,244
<i>He's great. He's gonna open his own jazz club.
Yeah, it's gonna be incredible.</i>

691
01:05:28,331 --> 01:05:30,893
<i>Uh no. He's- he's nobody yet. He needs um..</i>

692
01:05:35,319 --> 01:05:36,921
<i>He's saving up, I think.</i>

693
01:05:43,218 --> 01:05:45,065
<i>No but he doesn't have a steady gig.</i>

694
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:48,028
<i>But he's- he's figuring it out. It's just been a little too gilly lately.</i>

695
01:05:52,082 --> 01:05:54,655
<i>Mom, he's gonna find a way to open it and you're gonna love it.</i>

696
01:05:54,689 --> 01:05:55,439
<i>Okay?</i>

697
01:05:55,470 --> 01:05:56,470
<i>How's Dad?</i>

698
01:06:04,545 --> 01:06:07,589
Sebastian. Come on in, man.

699
01:06:09,309 --> 01:06:11,039
- Thanks for coming.
- Thanks for having me.

700
01:06:11,063 --> 01:06:12,557
I wasn't sure I'd see you today.

701
01:06:13,577 --> 01:06:15,589
- So here's the deal. 
- Okay.

702
01:06:15,622 --> 01:06:18,440
We got distribution with Universal.
We got our own imprint.

703
01:06:18,638 --> 01:06:20,015
We're about to go on the road.

704
01:06:20,754 --> 01:06:22,213
We can pay you a thousand bucks a week...

705
01:06:22,237 --> 01:06:26,123
plus a cut of the ticket revenue
and merchandising. Sound good?

706
01:06:29,592 --> 01:06:30,592
- Sebastian? 
- Yup.

707
01:06:30,654 --> 01:06:31,654
All right.

708
01:06:32,142 --> 01:06:33,182
- Let's play. 
- Okay.

709
01:07:25,211 --> 01:07:28,437


710
01:07:30,354 --> 01:07:32,890
I know. It's different.

711
01:07:35,455 --> 01:07:36,987
But you say you want to save jazz.

712
01:07:37,713 --> 01:07:39,959
How are you gonna save jazz if no one's listening?

713
01:07:40,430 --> 01:07:42,610
Jazz is dying because of people like you.

714
01:07:42,855 --> 01:07:46,490
You play into 90 year olds at The Lighthouse.

715
01:07:47,204 --> 01:07:49,119
Where are the kids? Where are the young people?

716
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:53,923
You're so obsessed with Kenny
Clarke and Thelonious Monk.

717
01:07:54,147 --> 01:07:55,893
These guys were revolutionaries.

718
01:07:56,196 --> 01:07:59,714
How are you going to be a revolutionary,
if you're such a traditionalist?

719
01:08:00,169 --> 01:08:03,867
You holding on to the past, but jazz is about the future.

720
01:08:08,908 --> 01:08:13,582
I know. The other guy, he wasn't as good as you.

721
01:08:15,223 --> 01:08:17,458
But you're a pain in the ass, man.

Hey, it's me.

794
01:16:40,373 --> 01:16:42,493
I'm not sure where you are right now.
I think Boston.

795
01:16:43,359 --> 01:16:45,159
Maybe Dallas, I don't know.

796
01:16:47,767 --> 01:16:49,986
I haven't heard from you in a little while...

797
01:16:51,725 --> 01:16:53,257
And I miss you.

798
01:16:55,419 --> 01:16:56,588
All right bye.

799
01:17:33,164 --> 01:17:34,164
I thought...

800
01:17:35,731 --> 01:17:36,808
Surprise!

801
01:17:39,562 --> 01:17:42,805
I gotta leave first thing in the morning, 
but I just- I had to see you.

802
01:17:48,193 --> 01:17:49,700
It's so nice to be home.

803
01:17:52,775 --> 01:17:54,122
I'm so glad you're home.

804
01:17:56,951 --> 01:17:58,021
How's the play going?

805
01:17:59,611 --> 01:18:00,845
I'm nervous.

806
01:18:00,905 --> 01:18:02,423
You are? Why?

807
01:18:02,745 --> 01:18:05,785
- Because... what if people show up? 
- Pishi kaka.

808
01:18:06,676 --> 01:18:08,196
You're nervous about what they think?

809
01:18:09,385 --> 01:18:10,442
I'm nervous to do it.

810
01:18:10,483 --> 01:18:12,824
I'm nervous to get up on that stage...

811
01:18:12,857 --> 01:18:13,663
and perform for people.

812
01:18:13,697 --> 01:18:15,018
I mean, I don't need to say that to you.

813
01:18:15,165 --> 01:18:18,467
- It's gonna be incredible.
- You don't get it but I'm terrified.

814
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:22,302
They should be lucky to see it.
I can't wait.

815
01:18:22,861 --> 01:18:23,890
I can.

816
01:18:26,624 --> 01:18:27,805
When do you leave? In the morning?

817
01:18:28,757 --> 01:18:32,221
Yeah. 6:45. Boise.

818
01:18:33,317 --> 01:18:34,664
- Boise?
- Boise.

819
01:18:35,575 --> 01:18:36,575
To Boise!

820
01:18:39,925 --> 01:18:40,925
You should come.

821
01:18:42,685 --> 01:18:45,704
- To Boise?
- Yeah. You can knock it off your bucket list.

822
01:18:45,741 --> 01:18:49,312
Oh. That would be really exciting.
I wish I could.

823
01:18:49,753 --> 01:18:51,033
What are you doing after the tour?

824
01:18:52,429 --> 01:18:53,457
Why can't you?

825
01:18:53,935 --> 01:18:55,175
- Come to Boise? 
- Yeah.

826
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:56,283
'Cause I have to rehearse.

827
01:18:56,907 --> 01:18:58,275
Yeah but can't you rehearse anywhere?

828
01:19:02,427 --> 01:19:03,627
Anywhere you are?

829
01:19:04,726 --> 01:19:06,572
I mean- I guess.

830
01:19:08,867 --> 01:19:12,442
Well, all my stuff is here and it's in two weeks.
So I don't think really think that would be...

831
01:19:14,176 --> 01:19:14,802
Okay.

832
01:19:14,935 --> 01:19:17,575
- the best idea right now, but...
- Right.

833
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:19,480
I wish I could.

834
01:19:20,785 --> 01:19:23,680
We're just gonna have to try and see each other, you know, 
so that we see each other.

835
01:19:23,713 --> 01:19:25,411
I know but when are you done?

836
01:19:26,641 --> 01:19:27,779
What do you mean? I mean...

837
01:19:29,525 --> 01:19:30,830
When you're finish with the whole tour?

838
01:19:31,492 --> 01:19:33,425
After we finish, we're gonna go to recording

839
01:19:33,458 --> 01:19:34,935
and then we'll go back on tour.

840
01:19:35,716 --> 01:19:37,344
You know, we tour so we can make the records...

841
01:19:37,431 --> 01:19:38,980
so we can go back to tour the record.

842
01:19:43,325 --> 01:19:44,858
So it's like the long haul?

843
01:19:48,764 --> 01:19:49,948
What do you mean the "long haul"?

844
01:19:50,537 --> 01:19:53,619
I mean the long haul that you're gonna stay in this band...

845
01:19:53,653 --> 01:19:54,846
for a long time.

846
01:19:56,146 --> 01:19:57,450
On tour.

847
01:19:59,466 --> 01:20:01,381
I mean, what did you think I was going to do?

848
01:20:01,415 --> 01:20:02,731
I don't...

849
01:20:02,765 --> 01:20:05,536
I hadn't really thought it through. 
I didn't know that the band...

850
01:20:07,375 --> 01:20:08,821
- You didn't think we would be successful.
- would be important.

851
01:20:13,146 --> 01:20:15,877
No, that's not really what I mean. I just mean that y-you...

852
01:20:15,910 --> 01:20:19,127
I mean... You'll be on tour for what?
Months now? Years?

853
01:20:19,427 --> 01:20:21,287
Yeah I don't mean- this is it...

854
01:20:21,321 --> 01:20:23,157
I mean, this is- it could feasibly be- yeah for..

855
01:20:23,291 --> 01:20:25,056
I could be on tour with this...

856
01:20:25,090 --> 01:20:27,487
For a couple of years at
least, just this record.

857
01:20:29,005 --> 01:20:31,012
Do you like the music you're playing?

858
01:20:33,387 --> 01:20:34,743
I don't...

859
01:20:35,126 --> 01:20:38,504
I don't know... what- what it matters.

860
01:20:38,838 --> 01:20:40,725
Well, it matters because...

861
01:20:40,759 --> 01:20:43,455
if you're going to give up your dream.
I think it matters...

862
01:20:43,489 --> 01:20:45,346
that you like what you're playing

863
01:20:45,381 --> 01:20:47,204
on the road for years.

864
01:20:49,697 --> 01:20:51,318
Do you like the music that I play?

865
01:20:51,352 --> 01:20:52,482
Yeah.

866
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:55,460
I do.

867
01:20:55,494 --> 01:20:57,186
I just didn't think that you did.

868
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:58,411
Yeah well... 

869
01:20:58,445 --> 01:21:00,031
You know, you said Keith is the worst

870
01:21:00,066 --> 01:21:03,303
And now you're gonna be on tour with
him for years, so I just didn't...

871
01:21:03,338 --> 01:21:04,926
- I don't know what- What are you doing right now?
- know if you were happy.

872
01:21:04,950 --> 01:21:07,013
- Why are you doing this?
- I don't- What do you mean "why are you doing this"?

873
01:21:07,047 --> 01:21:09,820
I thought you wanted me to do this and 
it just sounds like now you don't want me to do it.

874
01:21:10,193 --> 01:21:12,031
What do you mean I wanted you to do this?

875
01:21:12,827 --> 01:21:14,157
This is what you wanted for me.

876
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,141
To be in this band?

877
01:21:16,165 --> 01:21:18,693
To be in a band to have a steady job.
You know.

878
01:21:18,726 --> 01:21:21,279
T-to be... you know.

879
01:21:22,488 --> 01:21:24,458
Of course, I wanted you
to have a steady job...

880
01:21:24,597 --> 01:21:27,567
so that you can take care of yourself and
your life and you could start your club.

881
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:30,176
Yes so I'm doing that so I don't understand-
I mean why aren't we celebrating?

882
01:21:30,266 --> 01:21:31,732
Why aren't you starting your club?

883
01:21:32,156 --> 01:21:34,566
You said yourself no one wants to go to that club.

884
01:21:34,866 --> 01:21:36,871
No one wants to go to a
club called "Chicken on a Stick".

885
01:21:36,895 --> 01:21:37,895
So change the name!

886
01:21:38,254 --> 01:21:40,347
Well, no one likes jazz! Not even you!

887
01:21:40,513 --> 01:21:42,140
I do like jazz now because of you!

888
01:21:42,145 --> 01:21:43,987
And this is what I thought you wanted me to do!

889
01:21:44,779 --> 01:21:47,929
What am I supposed to do? Go
back to playing Jingle Bells?

890
01:21:47,962 --> 01:21:50,804
- I'm not saying that! I'm saying why don't you take...
- Scrutting pennies so I can...

891
01:21:50,845 --> 01:21:52,391
- what you've made and start the club!
- start a club that no one wants to go ?

892
01:21:52,432 --> 01:21:54,410
People will wanna go to it...

893
01:21:54,506 --> 01:21:56,045
because you're passionate about it...

894
01:21:56,061 --> 01:21:58,492
and people love what other people are passionate about.

895
01:21:58,525 --> 01:22:01,125
- You remind people of what they've forgotten.
- Not in my experience.

896
01:22:04,485 --> 01:22:07,639
Well, whatever alright. It's- it's time to grow up, you know.

897
01:22:07,656 --> 01:22:10,134
I have a steady job, this is what I'm doing.

898
01:22:10,408 --> 01:22:14,154
And now all of a sudden if you had these problems, 
I wish you would've said them earlier...

899
01:22:14,187 --> 01:22:15,642
Before I signed on the goddamn dotted line!

900
01:22:15,666 --> 01:22:18,866
I'm pointing out that you had a dream
that you followed, that you were sticking...

901
01:22:18,947 --> 01:22:21,215
This is the dream! This is the dream!

902
01:22:21,299 --> 01:22:22,933
- This is not your dream! 
- Guys like me...

903
01:22:23,024 --> 01:22:25,633
work their whole lives to be
in something that's successful,

904
01:22:25,667 --> 01:22:27,634
that people like. You know?

905
01:22:27,789 --> 01:22:31,971
I mean, I'm finally in something th-th-th-th-that people enjoy.

906
01:22:32,004 --> 01:22:35,176
- Since when do you care about being liked?
- Just because I don't enjoy it, it doesn't matter.

907
01:22:35,216 --> 01:22:36,967
Why do you care so much you about being liked?

908
01:22:36,990 --> 01:22:39,298
You are an actress! What are you talking about?

909
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,018
Maybe you just liked me when I was on my ass...

910
01:22:59,064 --> 01:23:01,121
because it made you feel better about yourself.

911
01:23:05,871 --> 01:23:07,576
- Are you kidding?
- No.

912
01:23:29,217 --> 01:23:30,306
I don't know...

913
01:24:23,159 --> 01:24:26,632


914
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:52,852
Okay fellas. I'll- see you tomorrow.

915
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:54,237
- Sebastian? 
- Yeah?

916
01:24:54,328 --> 01:24:55,528
You're good for tonight, right?

917
01:24:57,488 --> 01:24:59,769
- What are you talking about?
- At 7, the photo shoot.

918
01:25:01,335 --> 01:25:02,991
For Mojo. You good?

919
01:25:06,369 --> 01:25:09,204
- I thought that was next Thursday.
- No, it's tonight.

920
01:25:12,335 --> 01:25:13,375
Is that okay?

921
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:12,083
- Tonya, give me the other camera!
- What's wrong with that?

922
01:26:12,156 --> 01:26:14,911
"What's wrong with that"? Oh I don't know- It does not bloody work! 
That's what's wrong with it!

923
01:26:15,610 --> 01:26:17,185
Alright trumpet, that's lovely!

924
01:26:18,848 --> 01:26:21,063
Lovely! Beautiful! Beautiful!

925
01:26:21,927 --> 01:26:26,450
Okay, keyboard. Okay, look up.
That's good. That's good. That's lovely!

926
01:26:26,878 --> 01:26:28,821
Wonderful. Okay, cut the music!

927
01:26:28,926 --> 01:26:31,149
That is lovely! That's lovely.

928
01:26:31,244 --> 01:26:35,139
Okay, now look. Now bite your lip like this...

929
01:26:35,226 --> 01:26:39,169
like you're concentrating on something, 
I don't know, like a piece of your music.

930
01:26:39,433 --> 01:26:41,684
- Bite my what? 
- Your lip. Bite your lip.

931
01:26:43,367 --> 01:26:44,367


932
01:26:44,655 --> 01:26:46,751
That's good. That's great. Beautiful.

933
01:26:46,950 --> 01:26:47,773
Beautiful.

934
01:26:47,806 --> 01:26:51,285
Okay. Now, just move your glasses down on your nose.

935
01:26:51,511 --> 01:26:53,609
A little bit further. Just a little bit touch further.

936
01:26:53,687 --> 01:26:57,281
Keep your head down, but look up at me.
Look sort of moody.

937
01:26:57,726 --> 01:27:00,115
Yeah! That is beautiful! That is great!

938
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:02,060
Okay, turn on the keyboard on live!

939
01:27:03,595 --> 01:27:06,315
- You want to hear the keyboard?
- No. You don't have to bite your lip now.

940
01:27:07,722 --> 01:27:08,790
Well, you should play something.

941
01:27:10,297 --> 01:27:11,932
Play something, you know. Anything.

942
01:27:12,237 --> 01:27:13,904
You're pianist, aren't you? Play something.

943
01:27:27,486 --> 01:27:30,962
That's great! That's beautiful. That's lovely.
Oh, that's good.

944
01:27:31,124 --> 01:27:32,406
Now, don't stop. Keep playing.

945
01:27:33,217 --> 01:27:35,739
Come on, just keep playing.
That was great!

946
01:28:15,415 --> 01:28:16,953
<i>Shoot myself in the head.</i>

947
01:28:18,970 --> 01:28:22,011
<i>She's not even good.
And the window thing...</i>

948
01:28:22,310 --> 01:28:23,821
<i>- What was that? 
- Yes </i>.

949
01:28:23,854 --> 01:28:25,268
<i>What did she do with the window?</i>

950
01:28:25,292 --> 01:28:27,252
<i>Oh my God! Don't quit your day job.</i>

951
01:28:27,761 --> 01:28:28,761
<i>Oh well...</i>

952
01:28:29,259 --> 01:28:31,821


953
01:28:55,941 --> 01:28:57,000
Mia!

954
01:28:59,062 --> 01:29:01,696
Mia. I'm so sorry.

955
01:29:04,451 --> 01:29:06,892
Just tell me how it went? How was it?

956
01:29:06,924 --> 01:29:08,380
I'm sorry.

957
01:29:09,606 --> 01:29:11,046
- I'm sorry I missed your play. I'm sorry I didn't come.
- You're sorry. You're sorry. 

958
01:29:11,639 --> 01:29:12,639
You're sorry.

959
01:29:13,444 --> 01:29:15,895
- You're sorry. 
- Let me make it up to you.

960
01:29:16,977 --> 01:29:18,561
Let me make it up to you. Okay?

961
01:29:24,980 --> 01:29:26,462
- I don't blame you if... 
- It's over.

962
01:29:28,126 --> 01:29:29,891
- What is? 
- It's over.

963
01:29:30,419 --> 01:29:31,419
What?

964
01:29:33,471 --> 01:29:34,471
All of this.

965
01:29:35,104 --> 01:29:38,548
I'm done embarrassing myself. 
I'm done. I'm done.

966
01:29:39,621 --> 01:29:40,967
- Nobody showed up. 
- So what?

967
01:29:41,128 --> 01:29:43,054
I can't pay back the theater! This is so...

968
01:29:45,394 --> 01:29:46,566
I'm gonna go home for a while.

969
01:29:47,276 --> 01:29:49,921
- I'll come see you tomorrow.
- No, I'm going "home" home.

970
01:29:51,082 --> 01:29:53,328
- This is home.
- No, it's not anymore.

971
01:30:55,790 --> 01:30:58,011


972
01:32:09,053 --> 01:32:11,535
- Yep?
- <i>Hi. I'm trying to reach a Mia Dolan.</i>

973
01:32:13,133 --> 01:32:14,133
Wrong number.

974
01:32:14,304 --> 01:32:16,834
<i>Yeah, she said if she's not on her cell,
I'm told I might find her here.</i>

975
01:32:16,933 --> 01:32:17,933
Not anymore.

976
01:32:18,321 --> 01:32:20,518
- <i>Okay well, if you do talk to her...</i>
- I won't.

977
01:32:20,613 --> 01:32:23,117
<i>could you tell her Jane and Amy Brandt 
casting is trying to reach her.</i>

978
01:32:29,866 --> 01:32:30,866
Casting?

979
01:32:39,379 --> 01:32:40,805
What the hell is that?

980
01:32:46,234 --> 01:32:47,737
Stop that fucking noise!

981
01:32:58,436 --> 01:32:59,765
Why did you come here?

982
01:32:59,782 --> 01:33:01,439
Because I have good news.

983
01:33:01,772 --> 01:33:02,772
What?

984
01:33:03,142 --> 01:33:06,079
- Amy Brandt, the casting director. 
- Yeah?

985
01:33:06,112 --> 01:33:09,161
She was at your play and she loved it.

986
01:33:10,056 --> 01:33:12,075
And she loved it so much...

987
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:14,840
That she wants you to come in tomorrow and audition for this...

988
01:33:14,874 --> 01:33:16,601
huge movie that she's got.

989
01:33:18,291 --> 01:33:19,378
I'm not going to that.

990
01:33:22,092 --> 01:33:23,146
- I'm not going to that.
- What?

991
01:33:23,161 --> 01:33:25,522
That one's gonna be... No. That one's gonna be...

992
01:33:25,821 --> 01:33:26,843
I'm sorry?

993
01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:28,945
That will kill me.

994
01:33:30,645 --> 01:33:31,945
- What?! 
- What?

995
01:33:32,332 --> 01:33:34,414
- What? Stop! 
- No!

996
01:33:35,350 --> 01:33:37,109
- You have to be quiet. 
- If you want me to be quiet..

997
01:33:37,175 --> 01:33:38,230
- You're gonna wake up the neighbors.
- you have to make sense.

998
01:33:38,254 --> 01:33:41,514
- If you want me to be quiet, you're gonna have make some goddamn sense.
- They're gonna call- they're gonna call the police.

999
01:33:41,547 --> 01:33:42,214
Because- because...

1000
01:33:42,278 --> 01:33:45,137
I've been to a million of auditions 
and the same thing happens every time!

1001
01:33:45,213 --> 01:33:47,927
Where I get interrupted because
someone wants to get a sandwich!

1002
01:33:47,955 --> 01:33:50,776
Or I'm crying and they start laughing!

1003
01:33:50,871 --> 01:33:52,782
Or there's people sitting in the waiting room...

1004
01:33:52,817 --> 01:33:53,984
and they're and they're...

1005
01:33:54,018 --> 01:33:55,825
like me but prettier...

1006
01:33:55,864 --> 01:33:58,518
and better at the- because maybe
I'm not good enough!

1007
01:33:58,763 --> 01:34:00,403
- Yes, you are. 
- No.

1008
01:34:01,368 --> 01:34:05,249
- Maybe I'm not.
- You are.

1009
01:34:08,116 --> 01:34:12,005
Maybe I'm one of those people who always wanted to do it...

1010
01:34:12,084 --> 01:34:15,305
but it's like a pipe dream for me, you know?

1011
01:34:16,056 --> 01:34:19,383
You said it: You change
your dreams and then you grow up.

1012
01:34:19,416 --> 01:34:21,923
Maybe I'm one of those people and I'm not supposed to.

1013
01:34:21,991 --> 01:34:26,313
And I can go back to school and find
something else that I'm supposed to do.

1014
01:34:26,419 --> 01:34:29,061
'Cause I left to do that...

1015
01:34:29,112 --> 01:34:31,798
and it's been six years and 
I don't wanna do it anymore.

1016
01:34:35,555 --> 01:34:36,716
Why?

1017
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:41,934
- Why what? 
- Why don't you wanna do it anymore?

1018
01:34:44,151 --> 01:34:46,301
Because I think it hurts a little bit too much.

1019
01:34:48,932 --> 01:34:50,042
You're a baby.

1020
01:34:51,580 --> 01:34:54,196
- I'm not a baby. I'm trying to grow up.
- You are. You're crying like a baby.

1021
01:34:54,222 --> 01:34:54,966
Oh my God!

1022
01:34:54,999 --> 01:34:57,042
And you have an audition tomorrow at 5:30.

1023
01:34:58,184 --> 01:34:59,780
I'll be out front at 8:00 am.

1024
01:35:00,942 --> 01:35:02,942
You'll be out front or not. I don't know.

1025
01:35:04,828 --> 01:35:06,158
How did you find me here?

1026
01:35:07,530 --> 01:35:08,858
The house in front of the library.

1027
01:35:08,931 --> 01:35:13,723


1028
01:35:23,139 --> 01:35:24,767


1029
01:35:52,966 --> 01:35:54,503
- I got coffee. 
- Okay, great.

1030
01:36:13,170 --> 01:36:14,170
Mia?

1031
01:36:20,023 --> 01:36:22,503
Hi, Mia. I'm Amy and this is Frank.

1032
01:36:22,604 --> 01:36:24,604
- Hi, how are you? 
- Pleasure to meet you.

1033
01:36:24,744 --> 01:36:26,810
- I'm glad we found you. 
- Me too.

1034
01:36:28,733 --> 01:36:32,423
The film shoots in Paris 
and we don't have a script.

1035
01:36:34,233 --> 01:36:37,691
It's gonna be a process. We're gonna 
build the character around the actress.

1036
01:36:37,717 --> 01:36:39,906
It's a three-month rehearsal and a four-month shoot.

1037
01:36:42,442 --> 01:36:43,442
Okay.

1038
01:36:44,463 --> 01:36:47,228
And we thought you could just tell us a story.

1039
01:36:47,999 --> 01:36:50,853
- About? 
- Just tell us anything.

1040
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:55,178
- Anything? 
- Yes. Tell us a story. You're a storyteller.

1041
01:37:01,079 --> 01:37:02,120
Whenever you're ready.

1042
01:37:12,807 --> 01:37:14,852
My aunt used to live in Paris.

1043
01:37:20,082 --> 01:37:22,383
I remember, she used to come home and she would tell us...

1044
01:37:23,342 --> 01:37:26,704
These stories about being abroad and...

1045
01:37:28,987 --> 01:37:34,248
I remember she told us that she jumped into the river once...

1046
01:37:36,723 --> 01:37:37,723
Barefoot.

1047
01:37:39,858 --> 01:37:41,102

When do you find out?

1085
01:41:20,879 --> 01:41:22,419
They said the next couple of days.

1086
01:41:23,112 --> 01:41:25,820
But I'm not expecting to find anything out.

1087
01:41:25,865 --> 01:41:27,850
- You're gonna get it.
- I really might not.

1088
01:41:27,865 --> 01:41:29,435
- Yes, you are.
- I don't want to be disappointed.

1089
01:41:29,504 --> 01:41:30,504
I know.

1090
01:41:30,949 --> 01:41:33,403
I know. I know these things.

1091
01:41:36,350 --> 01:41:37,350
Where we are?

1092
01:41:41,075 --> 01:41:41,706
Griffith Park.

1093
01:41:41,727 --> 01:41:44,434
- Where are we? 
- I know.

1094
01:41:46,951 --> 01:41:48,021
I don't know.

1095
01:41:51,223 --> 01:41:52,356
What do we do?

1096
01:41:53,698 --> 01:41:57,982
I don't think we could do anything, 
because when you get this...

1097
01:41:58,222 --> 01:42:00,281
- If I get this. 
- When you get this...

1098
01:42:02,561 --> 01:42:04,302
You gotta give it everything you got.

1099
01:42:06,449 --> 01:42:09,119
Everything. It's your dream.

1100
01:42:09,928 --> 01:42:11,223
What are you gonna do?

1101
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,831
I gotta follow my own plan. You know?

1102
01:42:13,915 --> 01:42:16,702
Stay here and get my own thing going.

1103
01:42:22,334 --> 01:42:25,283
You'll be in Paris. Good jazz there.

1104
01:42:26,535 --> 01:42:27,898
And you love jazz now.

1105
01:42:30,287 --> 01:42:31,287
Right?

1106
01:42:32,987 --> 01:42:34,019
Yes.

1107
01:42:43,774 --> 01:42:46,019
I guess we're just gonna have to wait and see.

1108
01:42:55,020 --> 01:42:56,630
I'll always gonna love you.

1109
01:42:58,654 --> 01:43:00,278
I'll always gonna love you too.

1110
01:43:08,313 --> 01:43:09,472
Look at this view!

1111
01:43:12,001 --> 01:43:12,823
I've seen better.

1112
01:43:12,879 --> 01:43:13,923
- It's the worst. 
- Yeah.

1113
01:43:14,123 --> 01:43:15,158
Yeah.

1114
01:43:18,722 --> 01:43:20,457
I've never been here during the day.

1115
01:43:32,358 --> 01:43:38,089


1116
01:43:45,486 --> 01:43:51,675


1117
01:44:13,265 --> 01:44:15,940
- Hi. Can I have two iced coffees, please.
- Right. Of course.

1118
01:44:16,057 --> 01:44:19,267
- On us.
- Oh, no thank you. I insist.

1119
01:44:49,357 --> 01:44:52,437
Sounds good. Harris did a good job.

1120
01:44:53,538 --> 01:44:54,420
It took him long enough.

1121
01:44:54,441 --> 01:44:56,964
He always does. Signature time.

1122
01:44:59,958 --> 01:45:01,347
It's not doing too bad, Seb.

1123
01:45:01,857 --> 01:45:03,142
"Not too bad" is great.

1124
01:45:03,739 --> 01:45:05,659
- See you tonight. 
- See you tonight.

1125
01:45:26,740 --> 01:45:27,740
Hi.

1126
01:45:28,245 --> 01:45:30,044
- How was your day? 
- Good.

1127
01:45:34,810 --> 01:45:36,234
- How is she? 
- She's great.

1128
01:45:36,297 --> 01:45:37,297
- Yeah? 
- Yeah, come on.

1129
01:45:38,199 --> 01:45:39,246
Hi Myke!

1130
01:45:40,716 --> 01:45:42,810
I didn't think you were gonna be home yet.

1131
01:45:44,538 --> 01:45:46,780
- Are you drawing? 
- Yeah.

1132
01:45:46,795 --> 01:45:49,751
Can I help? You know I love to draw.

1133
01:46:04,528 --> 01:46:07,425


1134
01:46:22,526 --> 01:46:25,038


1135
01:46:29,469 --> 01:46:32,407
<i>Okay Chelsea, we're gonna go.
Are you good?</i>

1136
01:46:32,430 --> 01:46:33,709
- We're good. 
- You need anything?

1137
01:46:34,530 --> 01:46:36,072
Bye baby.

1138
01:46:36,681 --> 01:46:38,052
- Say "Bye bye, Mommy." 
- Sleep well.

1139
01:46:38,076 --> 01:46:40,534
- Bye, Mommy. - Have fun with Chelsea.

1140
01:46:40,726 --> 01:46:43,243
- Have fun. Bye, Mia.
- Bye. Thank you so much.

1141
01:46:43,276 --> 01:46:45,076
- Good night guys. Bye sweetie!
- Good night.

1142
01:46:55,194 --> 01:46:56,194
Oh boy!

1143
01:46:57,998 --> 01:47:00,004
What if we miss this? What
do you wanna tell Natalie?

1144
01:47:01,797 --> 01:47:04,091
- Maybe we'll just see her back in New York.
- Okay.

1145
01:47:06,822 --> 01:47:09,259
- I do not miss this. 
- It is bad.

1146
01:47:16,307 --> 01:47:18,187
Do you just wanna pull off here and go to dinner?

1147
01:47:21,082 --> 01:47:23,483
- Sure yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay.

1148
01:47:52,598 --> 01:47:53,723
Do you wanna check it out?

1149
01:47:54,883 --> 01:47:56,027
Okay.

1150
01:48:12,235 --> 01:48:15,568


1151
01:48:16,561 --> 01:48:17,877
This place is pretty cool.

1152
01:48:28,629 --> 01:48:29,779
I love it.

1153
01:49:18,681 --> 01:49:20,095
Cal Bennett on the sax!

1154
01:49:20,294 --> 01:49:21,015
Yeah!

01:49:21,046 --> 01:49:22,892
Javier Gonzalez on trumpet.

1156
01:49:22,913 --> 01:49:25,260
The lovely Nedra Wheeler on bass.

1157
01:49:25,595 --> 01:49:29,883
The one and only Clifton
"Fou Fou" Eddie on drums!

1158
01:49:30,408 --> 01:49:32,359
And a little too good on the piano...

1159
01:49:32,511 --> 01:49:34,252
So good that he's gonna own this place if I'm not careful,

1160
01:49:34,687 --> 01:49:36,364
Khirye Tyler, everybody.

1161
01:49:49,659 --> 01:49:51,200
Welcome to Seb's.

1162
01:51:41,744 --> 01:51:43,757
I just heard you play and I wanted to...

1163
01:52:33,856 --> 01:52:35,531


1164
01:52:50,159 --> 01:52:52,715


1165
01:53:57,792 --> 01:53:59,793


1166
01:54:02,577 --> 01:54:03,708


1167
01:54:03,733 --> 01:54:05,540


1168
01:58:31,231 --> 01:58:32,551
You want to stay through another?

1169
01:58:38,717 --> 01:58:39,717
No, we should go.

1170
01:58:40,214 --> 01:58:41,410
Okay.

1171
01:59:43,286 --> 01:59:45,734
One, two... one, two, three, four.
