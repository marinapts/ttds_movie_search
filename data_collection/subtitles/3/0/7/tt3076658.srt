1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,729
Boys, let's go.

2
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,169
Come on, tighten up.

3
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,929
Single file, gentlemen.

4
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,764
Center of the hall.

5
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,531
- Come on, tighten it up.
- Condition unit one!

6
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,170
Condition unit one, copy that.

7
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,766
On the ground. Show me hands, let's go.

8
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,046
Hands!

9
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,771
Code blue! Fight in progress!

10
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,645
Come on, let's fight, man! Let him go!

11
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,561
At least let me get my shoes.

12
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,170
Mary Anne.

13
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,321
Hello.

14
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,481
Thank you.

15
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,691
Adonis got into a fight today,
and he's in holding.

16
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,730
If you wanna see him,
we're gonna have to go up there.

17
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,328
He's a good kid, he just...

18
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,251
Fights.

19
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,124
All the time.

20
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,680
- Johnson?
- Yeah.

21
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,291
- Right this way.
- Thanks.

22
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,568
Johnson, got a visitor.

23
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,041
Adonis.

24
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,004
Come on in.

25
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,610
I'd like you to meet Mrs...

26
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,841
Uh...

27
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,767
Could we have a moment, please?

28
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,570
Sure.

29
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,643
I'll be right outside.

30
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,769
Why were you fighting?

31
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,929
I'm not going to another group home.

32
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,049
I'm not from a group home.

33
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,731
You a social worker?

34
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,361
No.

35
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,481
I am not a social worker.

36
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,569
Nigga said something
about my ma so I beat his ass.

37
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,927
I'm sorry about your mother.

38
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,563
I know what it's like to lose someone.

39
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,448
When your father died,
I was angry for so long.

40
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,004
I hurt myself, pushed family away.

41
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,730
I don't have no father.

42
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,846
What did you say?

43
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,048
I said I don't have no father.

44
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,089
That's not true.

45
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,208
He passed before you were born,
but you had a father.

46
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,366
You knew him?

47
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,805
He was my husband.

48
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,323
Adonis, I would like it very much
if you would come and stay with me.

49
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,441
Do you think you'd wanna do that?

50
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,682
What was his name?

51
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,327
Hey, James.

52
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,403
Don, sit down.

53
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,924
What you got there?

54
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,284
You're joking, right?

55
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,330
You get a promotion and you're quitting?

56
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,287
Look, this career just ain't for me.

57
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,080
What are you gonna do?

58
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,082
Hey, man, thanks for everything.

59
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,045
Just wanna talk to you about my job.

60
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,768
- You see your new office?
- Hmm.

61
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,122
Yeah. But, um...

62
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,964
Well, what's it like?

63
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,600
This is a big deal, this promotion.

64
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,527
Did they hire your assistant?

65
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,531
Thank you.

66
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,282
Very proud of you.

67
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,847
Superfight Two with Rocky Balboa,
the challenger

68
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,010
and, of course, Apollo Creed,
the world champion.

69
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,446
And there's the bell.

70
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,721
Comes over in a hurry now.

71
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,729
He throws a couple of
rights and lefts out there.

72
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,843
He starts to take command early here

73
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,004
and now he kinda moves his feet
along the side of the ring.

74
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,525
A good right hand thrown at him.

75
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,041
Another right and another right
thrown by the champion.

76
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,531
Creed is going for the knockout.

77
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,921
Just holding that right hand
and he's just waiting for that

78
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,161
precise moment that he wants...

79
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,688
There it is! He unloaded that.
But here comes Balboa!

80
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,683
Got him in that corner,
and there's lefts and rights.

81
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,285
Here comes Balboa coming back out.

82
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,680
A left and a right to the head.

83
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,524
But now it is Creed coming back.

84
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,284
Creed with the left hand.

85
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,364
Balboa appears to be getting hit often.

86
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,680
Take it to him. Take it to the body.

87
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,405
There you go!

88
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,803
Make your time count, baby.

89
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,130
You know what's coming up. There you go.

90
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,565
Check it out.

91
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,204
What you doing here, man?

92
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,488
15 and 0, 15 knockouts.

93
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,969
In Tijuana? No, bro.

94
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,804
That's barroom brawling.

95
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,610
Well, I'm all in anyway.

96
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,888
So I figure we start out local,
just to get our momentum going,

97
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,246
then we can move wherever we wanna move.

98
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,890
- "We"?
- I was figuring...

99
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,442
Adonis, these boys come in here,
this how they survive.

100
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,011
They gotta fight for life.

101
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,640
Kill or be killed. People die in there.

102
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,770
Your daddy died in the ring.
This ain't no joke.

103
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,086
I don't know him.

104
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,083
Ain't got nothing to do with me.

105
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,402
- Okay, you real tough now.
- Yup.

106
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,611
Nah, I ain't training you.

107
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,803
You know I ain't training you.
Nobody training you.

108
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,166
I'm gonna make sure about that.

109
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,368
We making champs in the Delphi Gym!

110
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,689
We not dancing!
We not singing! We fighting!

111
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,366
You struggle every day,
you fight for something.

112
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,681
You damn right!

113
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,281
Hey, listen up!

114
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,600
Adonis.

115
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,489
These the keys to my 'Stang right here.

116
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,801
Adonis, get out the ring!

117
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,530
All you gotta do
is land one clean head shot.

118
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,761
What I gotta put up for it?

119
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,480
Put up your hands. You a pro, right?

120
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,369
No, no, no.

121
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,331
You gonna get the shit knocked out of you.

122
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,731
- You ain't gotta prove nothing to me.
- Better listen to your family, boy.

123
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,806
Oh, my God.

124
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,962
At least put on your head gear.

125
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,566
- No head gear?
- Mmm-hmm.

126
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,721
It's on you.

127
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,411
Killer, right?

128
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,881
He a killer, right, Lil Duke?

129
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,448
Where were you at when
I was in group homes, huh?

130
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,886
You miss a meal?

131
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,121
Nah!

132
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,566
Which one of your killers in here next?

133
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,802
You pick him! You pick who's next!

134
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,331
I'm next.

135
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,729
Hey, I just need one round, bro.

136
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,484
All right, you wanna warm up?

137
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,569
I don't need no warm-up. Get my stuff.

138
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,330
I see you got your head gear on. Good job.

139
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,761
Nah.

140
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,526
Don't run.

141
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,200
Told you I'd win, man.

142
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,891
I told you.

143
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,201
I tried to tell you something, bro.

144
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,324
You don't wanna listen.

145
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,926
You wanna learn things the hard way, huh?

146
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,730
- Hey.
- Hey.

147
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,684
How you doing?

148
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,211
Doing good.

149
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,091
I just came home, I wanted to talk to you.

150
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,321
Yeah?

151
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,608
I quit my job.

152
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,611
Yeah. No...

153
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,605
Where did you get this? Mexico?

154
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,241
It's not that bad.

155
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,283
"It's not that bad."

156
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,603
I ought to knock you out myself.

157
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,241
You know how many times I had to
carry your father up these stairs

158
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,607
- because he couldn't walk?
- Yes.

159
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,206
How many times I had to wipe his ass
because he couldn't use his hands?

160
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,647
Is that what you want? No.

161
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,246
You want brain damage. Yeah, you do.

162
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,448
You want to be so brain-damaged,
you can't form a sentence.

163
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,761
I can get hurt doing anything.

164
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,604
Apollo didn't get hurt, he got killed!

165
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,926
People get killed!

166
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,491
I didn't take you in
for you to go backwards.

167
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,444
You're better than this.

168
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,880
I'm leaving soon.

169
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,445
I'm gonna be fighting full-time now.

170
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,888
So I wanted to tell you face-to-face.

171
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,766
You are your father's son
and you're part of him.

172
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,649
But it doesn't mean you have to be him.

173
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,247
I'm gonna call you.

174
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,287
Listen, you want to be
in somebody's ring...

175
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,524
You don't have to call me.

176
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,488
All right, smile!

177
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,090
How you doing?

178
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,801
This was taken from the 10th round
of the first fight, right?

179
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,611
Good call.

180
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,446
How'd you know that?

181
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,449
I heard about a third fight between
you and Apollo, behind closed doors.

182
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,245
That true?

183
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,131
How'd you hear about that?

184
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,921
Who won?

185
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,526
It's kind of a secret.
What'd you say your name was?

186
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,440
Donnie.

187
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,682
The girl said you wanted
to talk about something.

188
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,485
Yeah, I want to talk to you
about training me.

189
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,802
Training you.

190
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,361
I don't do that stuff no more.
Sorry about that.

191
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,090
Listen, it's getting kind of late, kid.

192
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,447
So I'm gonna close up.

193
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,801
How good was he?

194
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,644
Who? Apollo? Yeah, he was great.

195
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,121
He's a perfect fighter.
Ain't nobody ever better.

196
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,645
So how'd you beat him?

197
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,881
Time beat him.

198
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,442
Time, you know, takes
everybody out, it's undefeated.

199
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,806
Anyway, I gotta lock up.

200
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,769
When Mickey died, he came
and talked to you, right?

201
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,249
Talked you out of quitting?

202
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,641
Took you to L.A., trained you.

203
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,766
Brought you back.

204
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,482
How do you know all this?

205
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,004
How do you think?

206
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,764
What are you, like a cousin?

207
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,921
He's my father.

208
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,807
No, he isn't. I don't believe you.

209
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,961
Call Mary Anne.

210
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,326
Mary Anne. His wife.

211
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,681
The house number still works.

212
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,164
Oh, that's right.

213
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,089
You haven't talked to her
since the funeral.

214
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,521
She said you gave a nice speech, though.

215
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,126
Yeah.

216
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,684
Nice speech.

217
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,728
I want you to train me.

218
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,970
All right? I need somebody solid
and who else better to go to?

219
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,168
You at least owe me that.

220
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,009
I can tell the way you talk,
you been to school.

221
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,731
So I figure you got some brains.

222
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,531
Why would you want
to pick a fighter's life

223
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,806
when you don't have to?

224
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,566
If Apollo was around,
he would tell you that, too.

225
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,006
Well, he ain't around.

226
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,806
I been fighting my whole life.
I ain't got a choice.

227
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,687
It's always about a choice.

228
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,486
I was in the ring.

229
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,801
I saw how it went down.

230
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,411
That fight should've been stopped.

231
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,086
I should have stopped it.

232
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,685
Maybe he wanted to go out like a fighter.

233
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,923
Maybe, you did exactly what he wanted.

234
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,288
I think he'd rather be here,
talking with you.

235
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,727
There is a resemblance.

236
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,607
I'm usually here all the time,

237
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,881
so if you're ever in the neighborhood,
come by, if you need something.

238
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,730
I'll be at Mickey's Gym tomorrow.

239
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,451
I don't go there.
I haven't been there in a long time.

240
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,891
Since we're pretty much like family
who won the third fight?

241
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,884
He did.

242
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,609
In boxing... fighters' origins can endure

243
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,967
as the most sacred element
of their identity,

244
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,690
shaping choices that can
change their lives forever.

245
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,488
"Pretty" Ricky Conlan is a faithful son
of Liverpool, England,

246
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,845
a place where people find hope
in the tales of their heroes.

247
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,287
But for the undefeated best
pound-for-pound boxer in the world,

248
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,721
the future is filled with uncertainty,

249
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,490
with a seven-year prison sentence looming.

250
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,765
I didn't plan on spending me
prime years in a prison cell.

251
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,448
I hate letting me family down.

252
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,127
Now what could be his
final bout awaits him at home,

253
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,966
in one of his city's most
hallowed sporting temples.

254
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,045
Here, he'll welcome an opponent
who's also never been beaten

255
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,806
and who's boxed his way
from California streets

256
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,247
to American stardom.

257
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,801
Fighting out of the famed
Delphi Boxing Academy,

258
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,807
with a trainer whose father
guided icons of the past,

259
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,724
Danny "Stuntman" Wheeler

260
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,484
believes he's the sport's future.

261
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,085
Conlan's going away for a long time.

262
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,401
Now it's my turn.

263
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,721
I've never lost.

264
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,121
I've never even been knocked down,
and that's not gonna change.

265
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,408
A champion in a dark
and extraordinary predicament.

266
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,084
A challenger uninterested
in a hero's send-off.

267
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,569
This is 24/7: Conlan/Wheeler.

268
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,649
Kick this dude ass.

269
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,160
No respect, man.

270
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,725
I'm Donnie.

271
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,811
Yeah?

272
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,130
And I just moved in upstairs.

273
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,129
Okay. What do you want, Donnie? It's late.

274
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,481
I can hear your music.

275
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,086
Yeah? I didn't know it was that loud.

276
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,281
Well, it is, all right?

277
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,566
I gotta wake up early and work out.

278
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,083
Oh. Oh, got you.

279
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:21,006
You gotta wake up early
and do your, uh, jawns.

280
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,288
Keep your body tight. Cool.

281
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,965
I'll turn my music down.
You won't hear a peep.

282
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,121
Thanks...

283
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,849
Snap it back!

284
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,049
Breathe, Leo, breathe.

285
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,730
Good boy.

286
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,440
Hey.

287
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,081
Can I help you?

288
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,366
Looking to sign up.

289
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,087
- Where you from?
- L.A.

290
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,366
Hollywood!

291
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,090
Which gym? I know all those guys.

292
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,846
Don't have one. I'm more self-taught.

293
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,251
Self-taught?

294
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,922
You know Balboa?

295
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,206
Yes, we grew up together.

296
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,050
Most members just work themselves out.

297
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,804
For an extra $20 a month,

298
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,123
I can give you drills,
check in on you when I can.

299
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,810
Yeah, that works.

300
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,680
Double jab.

301
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,923
Move your head, babe.

302
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,604
Boxing fans have been waiting years

303
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,966
for the Superfight between
"Pretty" Ricky Conlan

304
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,360
and Danny Wheeler.

305
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,490
But we guess the fighters
couldn't wait another 24 hours.

306
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,445
Conlan punched Wheeler

307
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,648
after words were exchanged
during the face-off.

308
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,042
Wheeler suffered a broken jaw
and has already announced plans

309
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,010
to sue Conlan and the WBC.

310
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,401
Hey, Unc!

311
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,721
Unc!

312
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,010
How you doing?

313
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,050
Did you call me "Unc"?

314
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,402
Yeah, it was either that or O.G.

315
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,370
What's an "O.G."?

316
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,363
Old-ass gangster.

317
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,245
"Unc" is good.

318
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,731
I can do that.

319
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,484
It's all good.

320
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,809
So why'd you come by? You hungry?

321
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,729
No, I just wrapped up at the gym.

322
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,081
Figured I'd stop by.

323
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,241
Okay.

324
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,206
Maybe ask you a question.

325
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,761
Sure. I can do all this.

326
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,281
Uh...

327
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,166
What are some drills I can do
to get my hand speed up?

328
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,084
Some guys up there,
I bet they can help you.

329
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,571
There's a guy there named Pete.

330
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,245
He's a pretty good trainer.

331
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,171
Yeah, but he's with
his fighter most of the time.

332
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,442
I mostly just train myself.

333
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,090
They know you're a Creed?

334
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,881
I don't go by that.

335
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,122
I'm trying to make it on my own.

336
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,406
Name's Johnson.

337
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,244
- Who's Johnson?
- Mom's name.

338
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,280
Plus, just makes life easier.

339
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,481
Uh-huh.

340
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,245
Plus, you know, if you train me
ain't nobody around here knows me.

341
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,526
We could fly under the radar.

342
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,970
- They'd never know.
- Yeah.

343
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,647
I told you before,
I just don't wanna do it, kid.

344
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:38,123
That's cool, but maybe you
could just give me some drills.

345
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,127
- Drills?
- Yeah, things I could do on my own.

346
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,928
You don't stop, do you?
You're like a woodpecker.

347
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,770
My God.

348
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,491
All right. I got a few.

349
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,483
But that's it. Okay?

350
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,641
Of course.

351
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,766
Five rounds of jumping rope.

352
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:09,244
Three rounds on each of the bags...

353
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,131
When you get to the heavy bag,
just don't keep throwing your hands

354
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,770
because you can hurt them.

355
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,605
It's also about using
your legs, all right?

356
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,810
And then five rounds of...

357
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,171
Shadow...

358
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,361
O-W.

359
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,523
- There's a "W." Boxing.
- Boxing, yeah.

360
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,523
And that's it.

361
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,930
- All right?
- Yeah.

362
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,810
Okay, here you go.

363
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,001
Oh, that is perfect.

364
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,764
Good luck with that.

365
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,601
All right, got it. Hold that real quick.

366
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,211
All right, man.

367
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,124
Wait, don't you want this?

368
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,361
I got it right here.

369
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,289
What if you lose that thing or it breaks?

370
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,562
It's already up in the cloud.

371
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,846
What cloud? What cloud?

372
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,890
Hey, Ma, it's me.

373
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,724
I was just calling to let you know
I'm doing good and I got an apartment.

374
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,360
It ain't much but I'm trying
to make it into something.

375
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,405
I miss you.

376
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,886
I wanna hear from you, so call me back
when you get a chance. All right.

377
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,761
What, it's too loud?

378
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:48,447
No, I just heard you down here working.

379
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,682
Figured you'd wanna take a break.

380
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,566
Maybe get some food?

381
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,846
Where you from, Donnie?

382
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,286
I'm from L.A.

383
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,761
So is this how y'all
ask females out in L.A.?

384
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,090
Just wanted to know if you were hungry.

385
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,287
Not a date.

386
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,441
Right.

387
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,091
You know what? It's all good.

388
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,965
It's okay.

389
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,811
Hey, yo.

390
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,964
I am hungry.

391
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,446
I only have an hour.
Do you know where you wanna go?

392
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,484
I was hoping you could tell me.

393
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,880
You're from Philly, right?

394
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,970
Okay.

395
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,570
Good luck, man.

396
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,327
So where are we?

397
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,845
North Philly.

398
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,161
So this is Max's.

399
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,800
Hey, superstar! What's going on?

400
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,325
I'm well, thanks. How you doing?

401
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,931
You looking wonderful as always.

402
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,320
Thank you.

403
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,806
How you doing there, my friend?

404
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,088
This my neighbor and
he's a West Coast boy.

405
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,366
Ain't never had a steak before.

406
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,363
Listen, I'm gonna treat him
like he was my neighbor.

407
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,090
That's how good we gonna take care of you.

408
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,645
- You like pickles?
- Nah.

409
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,847
Okay, mayonnaise.

410
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,321
Put extra peppers
on that jawn, both kinds.

411
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,323
Ketchup, extra cheese.

412
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,482
- How much I owe you?
- $9.95.

413
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,051
No, let me get these.

414
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,202
That's cool. I asked you out, right?

415
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,522
You said it wasn't a date, though.

416
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,125
It's not.

417
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,121
Where we eating at?

418
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,406
Right there.

419
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,768
So I heard you back there,
"jawn" this, "jawn" that.

420
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,921
What's a "jawn"?

421
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,531
It's a noun.

422
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,121
See, these is jawns.

423
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,290
This is a jawn.

424
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,363
This restaurant we're sitting
in is a jawn. You're a jawn.

425
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,130
You got a jawn?

426
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,441
Like, a dude?

427
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,801
No.

428
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,483
I got too much going on right now.

429
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,801
Shows and stuff?

430
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,246
Yeah.

431
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,402
I'm opening at
Electric Factory next month.

432
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,561
What's that?

433
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,006
It's a big venue out here.

434
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,565
A lot of people got their start.

435
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,404
Jill, Legend, the Roots.

436
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,845
That's wassup.

437
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,491
- Can I ask you something personal?
- Mmm-hmm.

438
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,082
I got progressive hearing loss.

439
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,324
Just started wearing these this past year.

440
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,086
But I only need them in places
with a lot of background noise.

441
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,241
For now.

442
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,926
So it's progressive, so eventually...

443
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,605
Yeah.

444
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,524
Yeah.

445
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,170
I'm just getting ready for it.

446
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,011
Like I'm getting used to these,
I'm learning sign language and stuff.

447
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,844
But I really can only remember bad words.

448
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,202
Ones that aren't that useful like...

449
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,967
The fuck's that?

450
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,681
You can't tell?
This is the bull, the horns, this is...

451
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,601
Yeah, this is bullshit.

452
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,609
- That's your favorite?
- Uh-huh.

453
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,121
You don't really seem like a boxer to me.

454
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,611
I mean, you're in shape and all but...

455
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,642
I don't know. Aren't most boxers like...

456
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,564
- Like what?
- Like street.

457
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,643
I'm not saying you're
a square or anything,

458
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,802
but I'm just curious,
what made you wanna fight?

459
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,720
My pop was a fighter.

460
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,803
Oh, right. That makes sense.

461
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,086
Did he fight pro?

462
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,280
Something like that.

463
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,129
Does he train you?

464
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,124
My pop died before I was born.

465
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,809
I'm sorry to hear that.

466
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,010
So what made you wanna sing?

467
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,721
Uh...

468
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,002
It makes me feel alive.

469
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,926
Where's your next show?

470
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,689
That place that you saw me at,
Johnny Brenda's.

471
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,925
I got a residency there
so we're back on Friday.

472
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,809
Can I roll with you?

473
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,011
I wanna show up, you know. Show some love.

474
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,045
Let me think on it.

475
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,689
Okay.

476
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,047
Here we go, Paulie.

477
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,887
Happy birthday, my friend.

478
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,569
I didn't forget ya.

479
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,164
Your favorite.

480
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,803
Miss ya, pal.

481
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,491
Yo, Adrian, my darling.

482
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,368
The best of the best.

483
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,641
I'll tell you, Adrian, God.

484
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,402
It's getting harder to walk up this hill.
What does that mean?

485
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,322
Anyway, it's a good day today.

486
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,727
It's a good day, got no problems.

487
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,325
Bills are paid.

488
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:16,887
Only thing is, it's tough to sleep
at night sometimes. My back.

489
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,850
No matter what you do,
it catches up to you.

490
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:25,128
Anyway, shall we see
what's new in the world today?

491
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,281
Whoa.

492
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,681
Hey, Rocky!

493
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,841
Hey, how you doing?

494
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,770
- Good to see you.
- How you doing?

495
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,724
Hey, Rock! Long time no see, brother.

496
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,484
- Still here? Good to see you.
- Yeah.

497
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,007
- Hey, the Italian Stallion's back.
- How you doing?

498
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,764
- It's like a party here with everyone.
- Yeah, right.

499
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,042
- Welcome back, man. It's been a while.
- Yeah, thank you very much.

500
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,241
- How do you feel?
- Good.

501
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,965
- What, are you making a comeback?
- No.

502
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,969
- Hey, champ.
- Hey, Pete. What's up?

503
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,202
- Didn't know you were coming by.
- I didn't either.

504
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,362
I was just in the neighborhood.
You've done nice here.

505
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,528
Place is looking good,
new paint and everything.

506
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,966
- Very good, very nice.
- I do what I can.

507
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,565
- Remember my son, Leo?
- Of course I do.

508
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,006
A lot bigger since you last seen him.

509
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:40,770
- Yeah, very big.
- Rocky, he's 17 and 0.

510
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,729
Things are really opening up for us.

511
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,042
Leo! Come.

512
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,769
Rocky, option's still open
if you wanna get involved.

513
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,729
Little training, little motivation.

514
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,291
Let me think about it.

515
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,408
- Sure, sure.
- How you doing, kid?

516
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,607
It's an honor to meet you, champ.

517
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,489
Nice to meet you, too.
17 and 0, very good.

518
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,563
Yeah, I was supposed to fight
on the Ricky Conlan's card...

519
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,643
- Hey, Unc!
- But it got canceled.

520
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,841
Unc.

521
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,849
- He talking to you?
- Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

522
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,286
- You made it.
- Yeah.

523
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,408
Just walked by. Here I am.

524
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,811
How you know Hollywood?

525
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,247
Uh, we met at the restaurant.

526
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,171
That's it.

527
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,726
Okay, Rock. Okay.

528
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,451
You need anything, you let me know.

529
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,364
Okay. Good luck, kid. Seriously.

530
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,521
Thanks.

531
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,446
17 and 0. Kid's got a future. Tough.

532
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,524
Can I talk to you a minute?

533
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,085
I don't really know what I'm doing here
because I got other plans for my life

534
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,730
and this wasn't part of it.

535
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,405
Your father was special.

536
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,042
Tell you the truth,
I don't know if you're special.

537
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,487
Only you gonna know that
when the time is right.

538
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,170
It ain't gonna come overnight.

539
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,810
You're gonna take a beating,
you're gonna take this,

540
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,769
you're gonna get knocked down,
you're gonna get up

541
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,922
and you're gonna see
if you got the right thing.

542
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,890
But, you gotta work hard.

543
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,327
I swear to God, if you're not gonna do it,

544
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,641
I'm out.

545
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,611
Rock, every punch I've ever
thrown has been on my own.

546
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,127
Nobody showed me how to do this.

547
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,930
I'm ready.

548
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,283
Come on. Let's do this.

549
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,162
Step into my office.

550
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,601
You serious?

551
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,484
I am serious. This is old school.

552
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,245
You should be able to grab
one of these birds.

553
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,401
30 seconds?

554
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,364
Yeah, in your dreams.

555
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,930
Come on! You call that fast?

556
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,002
No! Again.

557
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,641
I thought you were fast.

558
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,691
Come here!

559
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,849
Get them legs moving!

560
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,287
Little harder, little faster!

561
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,650
Keep up the pace! Keep going!

562
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,129
Control your tempo then build slowly.

563
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,361
More.

564
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,529
Build, build, build.

565
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,721
Go!

566
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,684
That bell don't mean school's out, Donnie.

567
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,921
Keep going.

568
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,604
That bell means hell.

569
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,681
Just go get the chicken.
It's not that big a deal.

570
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,966
Come here! God damn it!

571
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,010
Oh, my God!

572
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,571
That's pretty good.
Chickens are slowing down.

573
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,568
All right. Donnie, get into your stance.

574
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,204
Make a small target, turn sideways. Okay.

575
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,882
You see this guy here staring back at you?

576
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,041
Yeah.

577
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,770
That's your toughest opponent.

578
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,481
Every time you get into the ring,
that's who you're going against.

579
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:07,850
I believe that in boxing
and I do believe that in life, okay?

580
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,924
Now throw a jab in the jaw.

581
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,611
All right, one to the gut.

582
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,606
Now, every time you punch this guy,
what's he doing?

583
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,091
- He's throwing one back at me.
- That's right.

584
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:19,841
So either you block it, slip it
or get out of the way. Go.

585
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,931
I'll leave you two alone for a while.

586
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,771
Good luck.

587
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,321
- Hey.
- Yo.

588
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,722
What's up? Is it cool?

589
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,487
Yes.

590
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,330
Smells good in here.

591
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,328
I don't even know what fighters drink.

592
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,005
Do you drink tea?

593
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,003
Yeah, tea's good. Thank you.

594
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,241
Yeah.

595
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,970
So this is the house.

596
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,566
This is it.

597
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,646
What you working on?

598
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,007
Uh...

599
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,041
Uh, uh, uh...

600
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,001
- Where the beat go?
- Sorry.

601
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,529
Hey, check you out.

602
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,841
Whoo.

603
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,845
Yeah!

604
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,840
One, two, three.

605
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:23,163
I like that. Very good.

606
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,886
Keep that balance going. Way to go.

607
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,845
Donnie, get up. You gotta keep moving.

608
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,362
It's tough but you gotta do it.

609
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,851
You get a "B" in tough.

610
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,729
Kid's looking good, champ!

611
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,729
Yeah, he's getting there.

612
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,009
Hey, Hollywood,
what do you weigh right now?

613
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,291
I don't know, probably like 180.

614
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,441
Why?

615
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:59,410
Get down to a buck 75, we'll make
something happen, if you're interested.

616
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,641
- Hell, yeah, I'm interested.
- No.

617
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,962
I do the talking, okay?
You do the fighting.

618
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,487
175? That's your boy's weight.
How you doing, Leo?

619
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,210
- What's up, Rock?
- Yeah.

620
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,805
He could use a fight to keep warm.

621
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,445
- Warm?
- I'm not gonna lie to you.

622
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,887
People will come out to see you
in the corner again, champ.

623
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,930
We'll make it like the old days.
Get the whole city there.

624
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,811
- Make a few bucks for everybody.
- No, I understand that.

625
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,008
But I'm just getting
used to this kid right now,

626
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,970
and, you know, he's getting better
every day but he's gonna take a while.

627
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,167
He's hungry.

628
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,368
You gotta feed him every now and again.
You know that.

629
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,160
Thanks. I appreciate it, chef.
We'll be okay. Thanks.

630
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,368
- Think about it.
- I'll think about it.

631
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,489
Rock, what we training for?

632
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:40,801
Yeah, what are we training for?

633
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,531
We're training to win, not get killed.
You're not ready yet.

634
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,409
I can lose five pounds.
I can lose five pounds like that.

635
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,891
It's nothing, it's easy.

636
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,731
Hit the bag.

637
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,161
Come on.

638
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,488
This kid's like
a tough Philadelphia fighter.

639
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,483
I ain't never even seen you battle before.

640
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,530
Yeah, but I've been watching him,
and I'm pretty sure he'd catch my fade.

641
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,648
- What's a fade?
- I could take him out.

642
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,888
- Oh, okay.
- All right, listen.

643
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,327
Let me make you an offer you can't refuse.

644
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,527
Are you crazy?

645
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,245
No, I'm serious, man.
Look, we take the match.

646
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,688
- Right.
- I got six weeks to get in shape.

647
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,286
Six weeks, I'll do whatever it takes.
At the end of the six weeks,

648
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,642
- you don't think it's right, call it off.
- Really?

649
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,564
Look, this is what
I'm here for, all right?

650
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,404
I'll go 24-7 with this shit.

651
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,962
Matter of fact, we can go
get my stuff right now.

652
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,043
- For what?
- So I can move into your spot.

653
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,562
Start training camp. Old school, remember?

654
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,404
No, no one's been in my house
in a long time

655
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,164
and I don't think
you'd be comfortable there.

656
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,811
What, you walk around naked?

657
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,486
No.

658
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,926
We're good then.

659
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,365
You better not walk around naked either.

660
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,005
That's for sure.

661
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,010
- Last one?
- Yeah, that's all of it.

662
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,201
Hey!

663
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,681
Hey!

664
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,206
You're moving?

665
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,850
Yeah, today's been crazy.

666
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,843
I didn't get a chance to tell you,

667
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,721
but I'm gonna be living with my uncle
for a while, training for the next fight.

668
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:17,961
That's your uncle?

669
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,241
He's white.

670
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,531
Yeah, a long time.

671
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,284
He's gonna be staying with me,
and when we ain't training

672
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,204
you're welcome to come on over.

673
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,767
Cool, thank you. It's nice to meet you.

674
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:35,880
Why you giving me that look?

675
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,646
When were you gonna tell me
that your uncle's Rocky Balboa?

676
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,561
I'm gonna call you.

677
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,722
All right, I'm not gonna hold my breath.

678
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,924
That Bianca girl looks kind of nice.

679
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,167
You like her?

680
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,731
Yeah, she cool. What, this one?

681
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,006
Yeah.

682
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,242
Women weaken legs. You know what I mean?

683
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,482
My legs work just fine.
Whose room was this?

684
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,530
- This is Paulie's room.
- Paulie.

685
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,200
Paulie was my best friend even
though he wasn't so friendly.

686
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,562
What happened to him?

687
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,569
- Passed away.
- I'm sorry.

688
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,125
Kind of a mess.
We'll straighten it up later.

689
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,089
It'll be comfortable.

690
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:18,082
Oh, man, this is a dope pic!
That's your boy?

691
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,328
Yeah, that's my kid, Robert.

692
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,605
Did you train him, too?

693
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,560
I tried, but he just didn't like fighting,
didn't take to it.

694
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:32,961
He still around here?

695
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:36,928
No, he moved to a place called Vancouver
with his girlfriend.

696
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,771
And I think they're having
a great old time up there

697
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,008
and, you know, I hear
from him now and then,

698
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,209
but it was tough for him
to live in Philadelphia.

699
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:48,330
Me and all that stuff...
You know, Rocky's son.

700
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,931
He's happy. I'm happy for him.

701
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,009
Why don't you unpack, all right?

702
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,685
Make yourself comfortable.

703
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,730
And I'm gonna go to the restaurant
and I'll be back.

704
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,202
Then we start first thing
in the morning, all right?

705
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,640
You got it.

706
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,685
All right, Paulie!

707
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:29,921
Ooh.

708
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,485
Hey, it's time to train.
This is how you start.

709
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,047
Get your engine going.

710
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,968
I'm gonna take you to this place called
the Front Street Gym up in North Philly.

711
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,406
- It's pretty good.
- Okay.

712
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,206
You're gonna train there, because I don't
want you to train in the same place

713
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,601
as the guy that you're
gonna be fighting, right?

714
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:20,807
Yeah, that makes sense.

715
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,361
Don, don't get in.
I want you to run alongside.

716
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,050
- I'm kinda antique, right?
- Yeah.

717
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,487
So I'll drive and you try to keep up.

718
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:28,766
How close is it?

719
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,410
It's close enough.

720
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,327
All right.

721
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,882
Hey, wait! Let me warm up real quick.

722
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,131
You made it. Hey.

723
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,770
I thought you said it was close.

724
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,251
Not that close.

725
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,926
This is Frankford. Tough place.

726
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,809
You wanna be a Philly fighter,
this is the place to go.

727
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:14,321
Philly fighters, you know, I think
they're the toughest guys in the world.

728
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:15,681
In a lot of ways.

729
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:19,441
Maybe it's in the water, I don't know,
but great place though.

730
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,921
What's up with all these bikes?

731
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,281
It's a Philly thing.

732
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,965
These guys are popping
wheelies and making noise,

733
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,525
going up and down the street.

734
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,806
Do you ride?

735
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,005
No. I had a Harley once but I fell off,
so I decided to use my feet.

736
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,001
Now, this kid, Sporino,
he got something special.

737
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:37,448
He's no pushover, so you're gonna
have to work, you know what I mean?

738
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,045
What do you think?

739
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:41,881
Not bad, huh?

740
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,201
Not bad at all.

741
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:47,888
Yeah. This'll get the job done.
Really will.

742
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,281
Uh...

743
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,051
Look at these guys!

744
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,851
Hey! The gang's all here!

745
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,970
Donnie, look at this.

746
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,963
This is a crew if I ever saw one.

747
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,400
Hey, Padman. Good to see you.

748
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,800
Hey, champ. How you doing, bro?

749
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,645
This guy is so good with the mitts,
he's gonna teach you a lot of stuff.

750
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,202
He's got a lot of knowledge.
And Stitch, best cut man in Philadelphia.

751
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,407
Hope we don't need him.

752
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:10,800
- What's going on?
- Welcome to Philly, brother.

753
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,001
- Pleasure.
- Glad to work with you.

754
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,321
And over here is Elvis Grant.

755
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,528
- He makes the best gloves in the world.
- Uh-huh.

756
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,206
And as my present to you,
starting out on the right foot...

757
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,447
- Nice to meet you, man.
- Nice to meet you too.

758
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:22,650
He's gonna make you a pair of gloves so
that your hands don't get so bad as me.

759
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,086
What? Is that coffee I smell in there?

760
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,366
Yeah, that's coffee.

761
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:26,925
All right, you guys
get to know each other.

762
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,161
- Amir.
- All right, Unc.

763
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,731
- Come here.
- Man, I could use some coffee.

764
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:32,008
Let me introduce you to my son.
This is my son, Amir.

765
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,161
That's the one you're
gonna be sparring with.

766
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,811
- Amir.
- Donnie. Nice to meet you.

767
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,087
Mmm-hmm.

768
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,206
Right hand fast.

769
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,044
Let it go, let it go.

770
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,409
Push off that back foot.

771
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,241
Come on, Donnie, a little quicker.

772
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,526
Come on, Donnie. Back it up.

773
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,444
No, just like he's doing. Yeah.

774
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,443
- I can't pivot fast enough.
- Yeah, just turn it.

775
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,806
That's your power.

776
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:59,886
Fast, pop it fast.

777
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,041
I'm popping as fast as I can.

778
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,645
I'm trying to push off my
back foot like you told me.

779
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,802
Hey, Donnie. Come here.

780
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,765
I came out here to work with you, though.

781
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,206
This is how I work, okay?

782
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:12,609
There's some things I can't do.
I can't do this anymore.

783
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,250
I can never hold the pads like that.

784
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,408
But I'm looking at you.
I'm working with you.

785
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:17,846
I'm working with this.

786
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:21,040
- Lighten it up.
- Am I still taking them real shots?

787
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:23,565
Slow it down. Hey, hey!

788
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,963
That's it. Hey, hey, hey!

789
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,970
This easy work, Pop.

790
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,046
Gotta keep moving. That's it.

791
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,922
- Time! Bell! Bell.
- Huh!

792
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,081
Taking real shots though!

793
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,129
- What you mean?
- Cut it out!

794
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,406
Take those gloves off right now!

795
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,561
- This my gym!
- Take the glove off right now!

796
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:41,921
Take your soft ass back to L.A.!

797
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,287
You ain't ready yet! This my gym!

798
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,442
Fuck this gym!

799
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,244
- Called a learning curve...
- Ain't no learning.

800
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,402
Hey, hey, hey! You know what?

801
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,125
You can't learn anything
when you're talking.

802
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:53,281
That's a fact of life.

803
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,403
As long as you're talking,
you're not listening.

804
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:59,161
Go apologize. You guys are
on the same damn team, okay?

805
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,685
- There you go. Good.
- You good. It's okay.

806
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:05,081
All right. Now let's go to work!

807
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,010
Double jab. Yup.

808
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,765
Go ahead over the top.

809
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,649
Right hook here. Over here.

810
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:16,291
One step at a time, one punch
at a time, one round at a time.

811
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:20,010
One step at a time, one punch at a time,
one round at a time. Turn right.

812
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:24,124
Come on, let's go.

813
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:25,806
Fast, pop it fast.

814
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,849
Right upper cut. Right up top.

815
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,329
Boom. Boom.

816
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,727
Good.

817
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,810
I want you to let it all out.

818
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:38,807
Now go right here.

819
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,962
Everyone's ever disrespected you,
see them.

820
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:45,689
Anything you ever wanted go after it.

821
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,882
Now's your time! Make a statement!

822
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,601
One step!

823
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,161
One punch!

824
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,081
One round at a time!

825
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:08,721
There it is.

826
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,167
Ah! You cheated!

827
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,201
Rock.

828
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,204
Hey, how you doing, Pete?

829
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,010
Something wrong?

830
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,610
Rock, I knew.

831
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,888
I knew there was something with this kid.

832
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:40,050
Rocky, I have been trying for years
to get you to come work with us.

833
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,247
Aw. It's okay.

834
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,971
All of a sudden, this kid from Hollywood
gets you out of the shadows.

835
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,610
No. No shadows.

836
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,201
I just didn't want to do
nothing in the gym, that's all.

837
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,931
Rocky, I made calls to L.A.

838
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,970
Kid's name is Adonis.

839
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:54,201
Kid has Creed's blood.

840
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:57,331
Now this fight just got big time.

841
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,565
I apologize.

842
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:04,211
Do me a favor.
Can we keep this between ourselves?

843
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,401
- Oh, come on.
- No.

844
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:09,042
I'm asking you as a favor.
I want him to make a name on his own.

845
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,890
Come on, Pete.

846
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:19,450
Yeah. Secret's safe with me, Rock.

847
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,361
I appreciate it.

848
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,924
Keep going. You're looking good.

849
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,320
Go on, get moving.

850
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,763
Hey. So how's everybody feeling tonight?

851
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,288
I'm about to go over the ABC rules
and the rules governed by the state.

852
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,046
No three knockdown rule.
No standing eight-count.

853
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,168
A fighter cannot be saved by the bell.

854
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:09,802
What we mean by "no three knockdown rule"
is basically whatever the referee

855
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,962
sees fit for competition...

856
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,721
- Unc, cut my gloves off.
- What's wrong?

857
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:21,961
My gloves, just cut 'em off!

858
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,485
I can't cut 'em off,
you're ready to go fight.

859
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:24,641
Are they too tight?

860
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,848
I'm freaking out right now!
I gotta take a shit!

861
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,322
Somebody gonna wipe my ass for me?

862
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,364
- Shit!
- Cut my gloves off, Unc!

863
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,045
All right, relax.

864
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:34,890
I'll cut you out of
these gloves. It happens.

865
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,724
Hey, ref, I'm gonna need some help here.

866
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,291
D, I'm gonna be right outside.

867
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:39,930
That's right.

868
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:41,531
Can you just stall
for 10 minutes or something?

869
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:42,920
I gotta put the gloves back on.

870
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,241
All right, I'll step on outside, Rock.

871
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,447
I appreciate it. Thank you very much.

872
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,483
- It ain't no problem. You got 10 minutes.
- First for me, man.

873
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,285
All right, come on. It'll be all right.

874
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,441
Yeah.

875
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:51,846
A little nervous?

876
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,522
- Nerves?
- Hurry up!

877
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,888
Blue corner, red corner.

878
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,890
All right, fellas, y'all had your
instructions in the dressing room.

879
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:08,328
Obey my commands at all times,
protect yourself at all times.

880
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,925
Any questions from the blue corner?

881
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,570
Questions from the red corner?

882
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,688
Touch them up. Be ready on seconds out.

883
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,366
- Right. It's about you.
- Yep. Yep.

884
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,807
It's all about you. Now, you wanted this.

885
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,803
- Let's go, Coach.
- I want you to make it happen.

886
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,007
- Can you do it?
- Let's do it.

887
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,650
- All right. Come on.
- Let's make it happen.

888
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:25,601
Let's go, Unc.

889
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:29,848
It's all about today!

890
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,848
There is no tomorrow! Let's go!

891
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,081
Nice!

892
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,482
Move and target, move and target!

893
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,050
Jab! It's the jab!

894
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,607
His face is right there!
Come on! Where's the jab?

895
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,289
Hands up. Hands up, kid.

896
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:00,605
Breathe, kid, breathe!

897
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:08,282
Let's go, boy! Let's go, boy!

898
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,206
Way to get out of there.

899
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,406
Keep moving, Donnie!

900
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,049
Move your head! That's it.

901
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,486
Get on him! Get on him!

902
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,843
Break! My break!

903
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,886
Let's go, boy!

904
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:28,166
There you go! There you go! Good.

905
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:29,401
Back off.

906
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:31,927
Leo! Leo! Leo!

907
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,206
One punch on top.

908
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,530
Keep moving. That's right.
Block left. Block left.

909
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:48,801
Relax.

910
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:51,048
Let's go, boy!
Come get this shit! Come get it!

911
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,611
You're doing good, kid!

912
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:53,841
Keep the pressure up!

913
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:00,481
Break!

914
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:01,846
Let's go, Leo!

915
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,001
Come on!

916
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,241
Let's go.

917
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,845
Keep moving! Keep coming forward!

918
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:07,721
Great shot!

919
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,081
Come on, Donnie!

920
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:15,406
What are you doing?

921
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,328
- Time!
- Yeah.

922
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,169
Okay! All right.

923
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:25,965
It's okay. Take a deep breath.

924
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,049
Through your lungs.
Deep breath. Deep breath.

925
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,441
Look at me.

926
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,205
I like what you're doing
out there, all right?

927
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:32,361
You're a little tight.

928
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:33,601
You're gonna loosen up, all right?

929
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,006
Here's what I want you to do.

930
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,924
I want you to throw your
left under the radar.

931
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:38,969
- That's it.
- Then come up with a shovel hook.

932
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:42,328
You're gonna see an opening, put it
right on his chin, that'll drop him...

933
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,689
Mouthpiece in, seconds out!

934
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:47,002
Your old man did that to me. It worked.

935
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,889
Mouthpiece in, seconds out!

936
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:53,290
Leo! Leo! Leo!

937
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:03,886
Come on!

938
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,891
Come on!

939
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:30,330
Tie him up! That's it.
Good boy! Tie him up!

940
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:31,567
Break!

941
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:34,167
Come on!

942
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:39,370
Kid, seize it now! Now! Now!

943
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,163
- Get up! Get up!
- Come on, kid! Come on!

944
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,924
- One! Two!
- Get up and get some!

945
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,246
Three! Four!

946
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,401
We got him, Rock!

947
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:51,210
Five! Six!

948
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:52,885
Seven! Eight!

949
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,809
- I'm good.
- Nine! Ten!

950
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,001
That's it, baby!

951
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,208
We got one, Rock! Whoo!

952
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:01,646
- We got one! Yeah, we got one!
- Unbelievable!

953
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:03,205
- It's because of you!
- No, you did it.

954
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,362
Come on, man! You did it.

955
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:07,887
You okay?

956
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,041
Give him some room. Rock. Rock. Rock.

957
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,361
Lucky shot.

958
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,762
Come on in! Bianca! Bianca! Come in!

959
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:15,681
Sorry! Sorry!

960
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:16,921
I'm all good.

961
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:19,408
You didn't say you had hands like that!

962
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:21,801
Why didn't you say you had
hands like that, though?

963
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:24,884
Well, but girl, I'm square though.
I'm square though.

964
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,690
You good? What we doing after this?

965
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:27,841
Let's go for it.

966
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,411
- Let's go tear the city up!
- Okay.

967
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:00,605
- Hey.
- Hmm.

968
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,603
I made something for you.

969
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:17,163
- Keep 'em closed.
- Mmm-hmm.

970
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,451
Come listen with me.

971
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:19,766
- What about your uncle?
- Huh.

972
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,126
He's asleep.

973
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:24,205
He old, man.

974
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,326
There he is.

975
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:03,726
- What's up, Unc?
- Hey, how you feeling?

976
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:07,441
I'm good. I'm a little sore,
but I'm all right.

977
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:09,890
- You want some toast?
- Okay.

978
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,250
So you cooking or you watching?

979
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:14,401
No, I'm looking you up.

980
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:15,891
- You're doing what?
- I'm looking you up.

981
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:17,684
No, don't do that. I'm right here.

982
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:24,561
Mmm.

983
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:29,561
What's up?

984
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,770
You got something you wanna tell me?

985
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:46,527
- I didn't lie.
- You might as well have.

986
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:47,806
You told me that your dad
was some fighter.

987
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:49,849
You didn't say he was the most
famous fighter to ever live.

988
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,809
People look at me differently
when they know.

989
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,121
They look at Apollo differently, too.

990
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:55,049
Yeah, Donnie, but I'm not people.

991
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:56,446
I don't care about that shit.

992
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:59,046
I do care about you keeping it
100 with me, though.

993
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,681
Well, listen. You're right, okay?

994
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:04,162
No, seriously, look. You...

995
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,561
100% honesty from here on out.

996
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:14,003
All right. So his...
His wife, that's not your mom?

997
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,083
Apollo had an affair with my mom.

998
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:20,642
All right? She died when I was young.

999
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:23,925
I bounced around foster care
for a couple years.

1000
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,284
In and out of juvie.

1001
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:29,128
Then Mary Anne tracked me down
and took me in.

1002
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:32,011
Anything else?

1003
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:35,880
Ask me.

1004
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:38,443
How many females have you
been with before me?

1005
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,602
Anything else?

1006
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,249
Look, Bianca, come on now, you different.

1007
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:44,447
How?

1008
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:46,762
When I'm around you I feel
like I know you my whole life.

1009
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,081
Mmm-hmm.

1010
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:49,890
Tell me you don't feel
the same way about me.

1011
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:52,122
Whatever. That's passion.
That's infatuation. That fades.

1012
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:53,441
I can't see that happening.

1013
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:55,409
- Why not?
- You motivate me.

1014
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:56,766
Okay, so I'm just motivation to you?

1015
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:58,206
Are you gonna find a problem
with everything I say?

1016
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,283
No, I'm gonna find the real
in what you're saying.

1017
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:03,881
Don't worry, it's cool.

1018
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,242
Maybe you're just motivation to me, too.

1019
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:07,766
- Oh, really?
- Mmm-hmm.

1020
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,126
I don't mind that.

1021
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:14,081
What?

1022
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:17,726
You do look like him, though.

1023
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:19,530
Oh, my God. I hate that!

1024
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:21,968
Just to get on my nerves!

1025
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:27,645
Welcome to PTI, boys and girls.

1026
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:29,484
We begin today with the boxing world.

1027
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:33,611
Adonis Johnson, a little-known boxer being
trained by Rocky Balboa

1028
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:36,690
handed light heavyweight
title contender Leo Sporino

1029
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:40,083
a second-round TKO defeat
in Philadelphia last night.

1030
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,766
An anonymous source confirmed
to ESPN that Johnson

1031
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:46,561
is the youngest biological son
of Apollo Creed.

1032
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:48,643
A fact that was kept under
wraps because Johnson

1033
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,643
was the product of Creed's infidelity.

1034
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:53,371
The boxing world is excited to
have another Creed in the ring

1035
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:57,730
but, Wilbon, does knowledge of this affair
damage Apollo Creed's legacy?

1036
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,530
Damage his legacy?
Let's go back for a second.

1037
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:01,409
A little history on Apollo Creed.

1038
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:04,803
I certainly have him right up there
as maybe the best of all time.

1039
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:06,007
End of discussion.

1040
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:07,685
He slipped. He made a mistake,
like a lot of people.

1041
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,922
This isn't gonna be the first,
particularly in the boxing world!

1042
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:11,121
Yeah.

1043
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:12,970
But I'm not gonna say
it's gonna kill his legacy.

1044
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:14,849
I think it's an embarrassment

1045
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,367
and I think the family must
have felt this embarrassment

1046
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,045
because they kept it
under wraps for so long.

1047
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,409
- But I really have one question.
- What?

1048
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:23,927
Can the kid fight as well as the old man?

1049
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:25,127
That's a stretch.

1050
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:29,883
I found us our next payday.

1051
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:33,646
Check it out.

1052
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:37,281
- Creed's son?
- Yeah.

1053
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:38,885
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

1054
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:40,280
He's got one fight under his belt.

1055
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:42,249
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I know.

1056
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,289
But he's got Balboa in his corner.

1057
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,450
No one cares about Balboa anymore.

1058
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:50,166
Kid's here because of a name alone.

1059
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:51,651
You're gonna do it.

1060
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,325
This guy doesn't even deserve a shot.

1061
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:56,006
Listen to me.
This is not a negotiation, all right?

1062
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:58,608
You're the idiot that ran
around Toxteth with a gun.

1063
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,245
Do you remember that?

1064
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,322
And you are the clown who couldn't
control himself at a weigh-in

1065
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:06,164
and lost us millions in
the process. Millions, okay?

1066
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:07,606
So look at it again.

1067
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:13,162
I don't wanna be remembered like this.

1068
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:15,004
I don't care how you're remembered.

1069
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:18,802
I care about your kids having a roof
over their head when you're done.

1070
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,371
Do you understand?

1071
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:30,526
Hello?

1072
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:33,604
It's Tommy Holiday.
I look after Ricky Conlan.

1073
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:37,850
- Yeah, how you doing?
- Listen.

1074
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:40,489
Is it true about the kid?

1075
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:44,370
About the kid?

1076
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:48,281
Uh...

1077
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:51,280
Think you and the kid have got 30 minutes
for a business meeting?

1078
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:55,491
All right, I'll tell you what.

1079
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:57,404
Yeah, if you can get over here, sure.

1080
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:00,131
We'll talk with you,
but it's gotta be fast

1081
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:02,049
because we're training.

1082
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:03,480
I can be there. Couple of days.

1083
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:04,880
- Yeah.
- I'll be in touch.

1084
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:06,641
Okay.

1085
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,406
Oh, man.

1086
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,722
Thanks for taking the time.
I'll get right to it.

1087
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:20,123
My guy needs to fight
in the next six months

1088
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:22,844
and we've beaten everybody.

1089
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,730
You want me to fight Conlan?

1090
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:27,890
I think it would be a very wise move.

1091
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:30,403
You've been down in Mexico
doing pro fights, eh?

1092
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:32,762
I've got you as 15-0 down there.

1093
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:35,241
And with the Sporino fight,
that makes you 16-0.

1094
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,602
Now, nobody needs to know these fights

1095
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:40,604
were in some hole in the wall,
do they, eh?

1096
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:45,771
You think I'm ready?

1097
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,571
Donnie, this man came here because
he knows you're a sure thing.

1098
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:49,767
Right? It's a sure victory.

1099
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,445
That is not true.

1100
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:54,971
Yeah, it is.

1101
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:59,121
Okay, listen.

1102
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:00,600
All right.

1103
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:04,246
This could be my guy's last fight.

1104
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:06,450
And I wanna make it count.

1105
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:10,442
Now, on that note, we would need you
to change your name to Creed.

1106
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:11,971
It's just a formality.

1107
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:19,121
And what if I say no?

1108
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:23,321
Well, then there's no fight.

1109
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:24,766
Without the name, there's no fight.

1110
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,410
It's a non-starter.

1111
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:29,480
Okay. Okay.

1112
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:33,087
Why don't you both take a day,
talk about it

1113
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:36,084
and we'll, uh, see what you say, okay?

1114
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:38,968
It's a good deal.

1115
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:40,571
Can't do it.

1116
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:42,006
Nah, it's not my name.

1117
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:46,484
And plus, I wanna make it
on my own merit anyway.

1118
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:48,480
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1119
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:50,808
You got a funny way of showing it.

1120
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:52,686
What's that supposed to mean?

1121
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:55,002
I mean, weren't Apollo and Rocky
like best friends?

1122
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:58,642
It feels like you're trying to tap into
whatever it is he left behind.

1123
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,770
I don't think that's anything
to be ashamed of, you know?

1124
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:03,127
What are you afraid of?

1125
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,170
Uh, what are you afraid of?

1126
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,001
I don't know.

1127
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:09,521
I mean, this hearing shit don't scare you?

1128
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:10,841
Uh...

1129
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,126
I always knew it would happen eventually

1130
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:17,281
so my plan has always just been

1131
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:20,281
to do what I love for as long as I can.

1132
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:24,884
I think that's all we ever do. You know?

1133
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:29,044
So, what are you afraid of?

1134
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:33,725
I'm afraid of taking on
the name and losing.

1135
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:37,131
They'll call me a fraud. Fake Creed.

1136
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,521
Why don't you think about what's true?

1137
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:42,282
You love to fight, right?

1138
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:45,724
Yeah, it makes you happy, right?

1139
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:46,961
Yeah.

1140
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:50,687
Yeah, and you are
Apollo Creed's son, right?

1141
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:53,641
Yes.

1142
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:55,689
So then use the name.

1143
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,484
It's yours.

1144
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:14,605
Hey, Unc, you down there?

1145
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,041
Yeah.

1146
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,762
I know you don't want me
to do this, right?

1147
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:32,286
I can think of
better things to do, Donnie.

1148
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:34,205
But if we did do it

1149
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:37,281
how we get it done?

1150
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:43,161
Mmm.

1151
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:47,441
Well...

1152
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:55,646
He's taller than you.
He has a reach on you.

1153
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:58,771
Definitely has a lot more
experience than you.

1154
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:01,082
And he's faster than you are.

1155
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:02,605
He's the champion.

1156
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:05,206
And since he's the champion,

1157
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:08,324
you gotta bring
the fight to him, like I did.

1158
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:12,326
You gotta go to the body. Dig.
And in doing that

1159
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,485
you're in a very dangerous place

1160
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:17,324
because you can get laid out.

1161
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:21,006
It ain't easy for me to be
in your corner, kid.

1162
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:24,003
I don't know if you're ready for it.

1163
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:26,003
I don't know if I'm ready for it.

1164
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,922
But I'll do what you wanna do.

1165
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:32,811
If it was anybody else in my corner

1166
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:34,325
I wouldn't do it.

1167
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,804
But I got you.

1168
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,010
So make the call.

1169
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:46,681
All right.

1170
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:57,363
I'm fighting Ricky Conlan.

1171
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:05,043
I'm fighting "Pretty" Ricky Conlan!

1172
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:13,042
Don't work him too hard, Rock.

1173
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:14,486
- Yeah.
- He's still a puppy.

1174
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:16,449
Come on, come on.

1175
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:18,763
Close the distance. That's it.

1176
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,446
Yeah. One, two.

1177
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:22,721
Good.

1178
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:24,970
Come on. Body, come here.

1179
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:26,645
Oh, yeah. Got a good hit.

1180
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:30,241
Okay.

1181
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:31,961
Come on.

1182
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:36,089
Dig deep. Body, body, body. Good.

1183
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,244
You up to moving around?

1184
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:42,966
Take a break.

1185
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:51,161
Oh. Hey, Unc, you all right?

1186
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:52,446
- I'm all right.
- You okay?

1187
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:53,601
I'm all right. It's out.

1188
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,450
- I'm all right.
- All right.

1189
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:57,051
Just let me walk.

1190
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,040
Just... I'm good.

1191
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:00,201
- Sure?
- Yeah.

1192
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:03,769
Hey. What's wrong with you?

1193
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:05,570
I don't know. I don't know.

1194
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:06,767
Come here.

1195
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:08,206
Just let me walk.

1196
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:11,723
No, we got to call someone
and get you to the doctor, okay?

1197
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:12,927
- Okay.
- All right, come on.

1198
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:14,127
- Off the rope.
- Easy.

1199
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,527
Come on, I got you. Hey, Stitch!

1200
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:18,045
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. What?

1201
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:20,083
- No, I'm really...
- Hey, somebody help!

1202
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:29,201
Hi.

1203
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:30,521
- Hi.
- Donnie.

1204
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:32,131
Dr. Kathari.

1205
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:34,644
Mr. Balboa, how you feeling?

1206
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:36,842
I'm feeling good, real good.
I could go now.

1207
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,128
Heard you fell down.
Was that the first time you've fallen?

1208
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,009
Well, without being punched.

1209
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:43,447
I'm gonna give you some more fluids.
That should help you feel better.

1210
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:44,801
And we're gonna run
some tests in the morning

1211
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,445
- and get you out of here.
- Can you do this fast?

1212
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:48,005
Because we got a lot of stuff to do.

1213
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:50,845
Just relax. All right? Go to sleep.

1214
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,128
- I'll check on you later.
- Thank you.

1215
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:55,408
Gotta do it fast. We have to...

1216
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:57,406
Donnie, we gotta train.

1217
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:59,050
Yeah, go to sleep.

1218
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:09,124
You guys need any more help?

1219
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:10,964
- No! We're good.
- No, we're good, thank you!

1220
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:12,121
- You got it? What you need?
- Nothing.

1221
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:13,281
Thought you got lost for a minute.

1222
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:18,244
I have not seen food
that look like this in this house ever.

1223
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:19,526
Yeah?

1224
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:23,930
Yes. You know, usually everything
I have has sauce or something on it.

1225
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:25,400
Get some of these collard greens.

1226
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:26,846
All right. You just...

1227
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,445
- Just a little bit?
- Yeah, a little bit.

1228
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:31,041
Bianca, you're beautiful

1229
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:33,487
and I think you'll be a great singer.

1230
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:36,530
I think you're gonna be a
great champ, like your father.

1231
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:38,125
Maybe even better.

1232
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:41,767
And for me, who's lucky enough
to be knowing both of you guys.

1233
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:44,685
Here we go. Cent'anni. 100 years.

1234
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:46,001
I'm honored.

1235
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:47,326
Lucky me.

1236
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,329
Keep working on that shovel hook.

1237
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:52,561
Ah.

1238
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:54,001
Right, that's it.

1239
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:56,481
Now, I wanna throw the hook
on the same side.

1240
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:59,166
So you come up on the right,
you throw on the right.

1241
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:00,481
Very good.

1242
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:04,647
A little more vicious than that,
little more power.

1243
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,963
Overdo it. Yeah! Very good.

1244
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:09,246
Hey, Rock.

1245
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,126
Yeah.

1246
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:12,725
Good. You're looking good.

1247
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:14,006
Are you getting jealous?

1248
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:16,128
Yeah, a little.

1249
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:20,410
- It's for you.
- Thanks.

1250
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:23,205
Hello? Yeah?

1251
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:24,481
Yeah.

1252
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:30,450
Yeah, okay.

1253
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:32,485
All right, thanks.

1254
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:40,925
Mr. Balboa.

1255
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:46,647
Thanks for coming in on such short notice.

1256
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:54,043
Well, we went through your test results
and your biopsy came back showing signs

1257
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:57,363
of large cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

1258
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:00,330
What's that do?

1259
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:03,286
Well, it's a form of cancer.

1260
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:13,850
I know that sounds scary,

1261
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:16,168
but the good news is we caught it early.

1262
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,722
However, we will have to
remove the tumor in

1263
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:21,571
your lymph nodes and start
chemotherapy immediately.

1264
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:25,848
My wife tried that.

1265
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,928
Mr. Balboa, as far as
options for treatment,

1266
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:30,730
this is the best plan of action.

1267
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:33,167
No, I understand, but my wife tried that,

1268
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:36,051
and I don't think I wanna do it.

1269
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:38,328
Didn't turn out so good. But it's okay.

1270
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:41,091
With treatment, you'll still have
a very good chance of recovery.

1271
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:43,525
Without it...

1272
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:47,924
I'm okay with it, really.

1273
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:50,131
Well, at least take these.

1274
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:54,281
It has information on your diagnosis
and options for treatment.

1275
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,642
- We can start...
- Thank you very much.

1276
01:18:57,240 --> 01:19:00,847
Listen, I'd appreciate if you wouldn't
say nothing to nobody, okay?

1277
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:10,324
Oh, man! There's so much traffic,
you wouldn't believe it.

1278
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,244
That senior bus was running late, huh?

1279
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,528
Hey, that's a cheap shot.

1280
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:16,326
- It's the truth.
- Get in the ring.

1281
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:18,249
- Hurry up and get ready.
- I've been ready.

1282
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:20,602
- Good.
- I've been waiting on you.

1283
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:24,810
Oh, come on, just put your gloves on
and stop talking so much.

1284
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:37,688
We got a few things to do.

1285
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:40,286
- It's all about you.
- Mmm-hmm.

1286
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:42,921
I already had my career. I did okay.

1287
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:45,401
What's your excuse? You got no excuse.

1288
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:49,281
Now is the time for you to
rise to the occasion there.

1289
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:50,726
- Just gonna put my...
- I can do it.

1290
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,848
Okay, all right.

1291
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,001
Now...

1292
01:19:56,240 --> 01:20:00,086
I want you to always, always,
always pay attention to yourself first.

1293
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:01,287
Right.

1294
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:03,801
If I'm not here to start with,
just start moving around.

1295
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:05,086
All right. Mouthpiece.

1296
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:06,651
Know what I'm saying?

1297
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,245
Too many punches to the head, huh?

1298
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:11,401
Yeah, whatever, coach.

1299
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:13,005
All right, get going there, champ.

1300
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:14,481
Bell.

1301
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:15,960
Come on, Creed!

1302
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:26,890
Be first, Donnie. Come on!

1303
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:31,041
All right, Amir.

1304
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:33,168
All right, champ. Don't work too hard.

1305
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:55,650
This shit for real?

1306
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:00,686
Doesn't matter.

1307
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:04,645
What you should be thinking
about is that fight coming up.

1308
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,246
That's the only thing that should
be on your mind, nothing else.

1309
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,607
What you mean, don't think about this?
When you starting treatment?

1310
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:14,721
I'm not doing no chemotherapy. No.

1311
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:17,242
If you don't jump on this quick,
you're gonna end up dying.

1312
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,205
I know.

1313
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:22,169
And you're all right with that?

1314
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,006
I am.

1315
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:27,843
Man, you sound crazy, man.
Give me the keys.

1316
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,081
I'll take you to the hospital right now.

1317
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:30,361
I'm not crazy at all.

1318
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:32,648
If I could take everything that was good

1319
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:35,406
and put it into a bowl or something

1320
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:39,562
and say, "Hey! Here. I'd like to
"buy one more day with my wife,"

1321
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:41,401
I'd do it.

1322
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:44,564
I would die a happy man, right then.

1323
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:46,890
Not gonna happen.

1324
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:55,566
So, everything I got has
moved on and I'm here.

1325
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:59,370
But you know what? It's okay.

1326
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:04,007
Because I said to myself,
"If I break, if I'm hurt, whatever.

1327
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:06,288
"I ain't gonna fix it. Why bother?"

1328
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:09,520
And I'm just some bum just living
in your crib, just nothing.

1329
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:11,530
You're a good kid, a good fighter.

1330
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:14,282
But you got your
whole future ahead of you.

1331
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:15,601
Mine?

1332
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:21,169
Back there, like
all them guys on that wall.

1333
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:24,365
In the back, in the past.

1334
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:26,524
We're going nowhere.

1335
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:29,441
I am to you just an old trainer.

1336
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:32,524
That's what brought us together. You know?

1337
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:34,730
We're not a real family.

1338
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:41,723
That was just in our heads, kid.

1339
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:54,529
Oh, what'd you do? What'd you do?

1340
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,249
Why'd you say that?

1341
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:26,762
Hey, what's up, Lil Creed?

1342
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:28,731
It's good.

1343
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:34,885
- Oh, hey!
- What's up, bro?

1344
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,166
- Hey!
- What up?

1345
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:37,441
Hi!

1346
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,206
You okay?

1347
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:43,161
Yeah. How you doing? You good?

1348
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,284
Yeah, I'm good. I'm a little nervous.

1349
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:47,727
There's just a lot of people here,
not really my crowd, you know?

1350
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:48,881
Yeah, I can see.

1351
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:50,730
Look, it's the boxing boy,
Lil Apollo Creed.

1352
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:52,530
I know his girl.

1353
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:53,727
What's up, Bianca?

1354
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:56,083
- Hey.
- You don't know nobody no more?

1355
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:57,287
Nah, I said hello to you
when I walked past.

1356
01:23:57,480 --> 01:23:58,527
You didn't say nothing to me.

1357
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:00,449
Yeah, I bet you did.
Stop acting light-skinned.

1358
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:03,486
Why don't you come over here and grab
this pic with me real quick for the 'Gram?

1359
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:04,881
Yeah, that's cool.

1360
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:07,564
Come on, man. You know he busy, man.

1361
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:09,085
Welcome to my city, champ.

1362
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:13,130
- There it is, Abbie.
- Believe dat.

1363
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:14,891
Hey, good looking, Baby Creed.

1364
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:16,326
Don't call me that.

1365
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:17,971
Don't call you that? Don't call you what?

1366
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:20,726
You just called me "Baby Creed."
I said, don't call me that.

1367
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,249
Hey, fam, dig this.
I was showing you love, man.

1368
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:24,561
You ain't got to come off like that.

1369
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:26,131
Yeah, that's cool, that's cool,
that's all love.

1370
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:28,482
I know it's cool.
You definitely know it's cool.

1371
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:30,961
When you talking to me,
you talking real tough, you feel me?

1372
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:32,531
Better talk to your little
pretty boy boyfriend, man.

1373
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:35,166
Get a VIP pass next to your
pop, talking to me like that.

1374
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:37,602
- No!
- Hold up, nigga!

1375
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:40,326
Donnie! Donnie! Donnie!

1376
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:44,326
Donnie! Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it!

1377
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:45,606
I'll kill your ass!

1378
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:46,761
Donnie! Donnie!

1379
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:48,920
How's he doing?

1380
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:50,081
He's all right now.

1381
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:51,765
- You know what happened?
- We had to separate him.

1382
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,251
He was fighting with the other inmates.

1383
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:54,646
Oh, no. Anybody get hurt?

1384
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:56,086
Nah, nothing life-threatening.

1385
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:58,129
- All right, thank you.
- No problem, champ.

1386
01:24:58,320 --> 01:24:59,321
Yeah.

1387
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:01,526
Hey, Donnie.

1388
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:08,210
How you doing, son?

1389
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,967
I know a lot of cops and they said,

1390
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:13,485
"Your friend's locked up."

1391
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:16,531
Friends?
You're just a trainer to me, right?

1392
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:21,640
I'm sorry about what I said
to you, back at the gym.

1393
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:23,330
That was just me talking.
I didn't mean it.

1394
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:25,005
You just stay away from me.

1395
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:27,646
Listen, Donnie...

1396
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:29,529
- Man, don't touch me.
- Come on, what...

1397
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:31,648
Get your hands off me, old man!

1398
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:34,167
Get your sick ass out of here!

1399
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:37,041
Leave!

1400
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:40,210
You here talking like you my family!
You got my real family killed!

1401
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:52,562
I ain't leaving

1402
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:55,371
till I tell you what's on my mind.

1403
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:58,568
You hate me, that's what it is.

1404
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:00,563
Or maybe you're mad with somebody

1405
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:04,202
who ain't here, Donnie,
who can't defend himself.

1406
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:06,686
You know?

1407
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:08,922
Now, I understand what you're
going through, young man.

1408
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:10,081
I've been there.

1409
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:12,602
And I know what it's like
to feel abandoned,

1410
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:14,683
and be mad at everything.

1411
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:16,888
And you're a better person than that.

1412
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:21,762
Forgive him. Because there's
nothing you can do about it.

1413
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:23,524
It's taking a toll on you.

1414
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:29,682
You're still caught in his shadow.

1415
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:33,444
You got to move, Donnie.

1416
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:35,450
Just leave, man.

1417
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:23,845
Let's go, Johnson.

1418
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:51,086
Bianca!

1419
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:54,648
Yo! Stop knocking on my door
like the police.

1420
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:55,847
Can you at least let me apologize?

1421
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:57,201
No, it doesn't work like that.

1422
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:59,169
You apologize when you spill
a drink on someone's shirt.

1423
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:03,522
But you assaulted the headliner to my show,
a show I worked really hard to get.

1424
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:05,882
What if I came to your fight
acting like an ass?

1425
01:28:06,040 --> 01:28:07,485
Would that be cool with you?

1426
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:09,486
Nah, I didn't think so.

1427
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:14,330
How'd you do though? You kill it?

1428
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:16,645
Yeah, we did good.

1429
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,162
I messed that up and I gotta
live with that, all right?

1430
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:20,560
But I never meant to let you down.

1431
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:22,324
Then what did you mean to do, D?

1432
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:24,727
Just have a little ego contest?

1433
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:32,041
Rocky's sick.

1434
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:44,571
He's got cancer.

1435
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:46,927
I ain't trying to make excuses
for anything that I did,

1436
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:49,162
but I found out right before your show.

1437
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:50,401
How bad is it?

1438
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:54,322
They want him to start chemo
but, you know, he's too macho to do that.

1439
01:28:56,680 --> 01:28:57,727
Jesus.

1440
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,606
Well, maybe you can talk
some sense into him.

1441
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:08,287
I don't think he'd wanna hear
anything I got to say.

1442
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:14,287
Yeah, well, give him my love.

1443
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:17,445
Hey, Bianca, don't close me out right now.

1444
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:22,769
Look, we both got a lot going on right now
so I think you should focus on yours

1445
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:24,200
and I'm gonna focus on mine.

1446
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:25,441
I'm sorry.

1447
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:27,766
What's that mean?

1448
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:30,689
I get it, I messed up.

1449
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:35,564
I trusted you!
Can you please not shut me out?

1450
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:40,405
I'm sorry, okay?

1451
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:44,050
I need you right now.

1452
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:20,851
Nigga, what's up?

1453
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:22,281
What's up?

1454
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:25,448
Hey, I heard you Apollo Creed's son.

1455
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:30,001
Yeah.

1456
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,286
That's what's up.

1457
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:20,847
Look like you lost five pounds.
You ought to sit down and eat.

1458
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:36,530
I mean, what I look like?

1459
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:39,405
Letting you train me
while you sit around and die?

1460
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:46,563
Just like any other fight.

1461
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:50,921
This fight? I seen it before.

1462
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:54,921
It gets as bad as it can get

1463
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:58,767
and most of the time, you don't win it.

1464
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:00,081
Yeah, but I don't care.

1465
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:02,601
I ain't training if you
don't get the treatment.

1466
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:05,127
So if I fight, you fight.

1467
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:39,529
- Hey.
- What's up?

1468
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:41,091
You been to the gym?

1469
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:42,726
Nah, I've been here.

1470
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:45,724
Okay. Here you go. Remember this?

1471
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:47,480
Get up.

1472
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:49,526
- Ready?
- What's...

1473
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:51,125
I want you to shadow box.

1474
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:53,442
This is a nice room,
let's see you move around.

1475
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:54,601
You're serious?

1476
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:56,524
- Want me to do it for you?
- No. It's all good.

1477
01:32:56,680 --> 01:32:58,489
- Yeah, ready?
- Come on.

1478
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:00,324
Time!

1479
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,286
There you go.

1480
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:11,131
We used to do that with one hand.

1481
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:14,841
I don't wanna say anything though.

1482
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:16,401
Two...

1483
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:21,090
Don't hit the lady.

1484
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:23,001
She'll probably drop you.

1485
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:36,202
All right. Come on, almost there.

1486
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:38,251
Come on, Unc.

1487
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:45,406
Oh, God.

1488
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:20,285
Come on, let's go.

1489
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:25,527
Yeah, yes!

1490
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:27,768
That's your thing, yes! More! Yes!

1491
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:33,486
- One. Two? The deal was two!
- I can't, no.

1492
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:34,926
I'm dizzy.

1493
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:46,886
Double jab.

1494
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:48,206
Step on right under there.

1495
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:56,721
Good.

1496
01:34:57,240 --> 01:34:58,605
At least we got the speed.

1497
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:02,446
We just need him to sit down
so when he hits something, he breaks it.

1498
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:06,921
Good.

1499
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:09,322
Step with it, you gotta step
with it. Come on!

1500
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:12,086
Little bit more.

1501
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:14,083
Little bit more, dig down. Good.

1502
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:15,651
Good. Keep it right.

1503
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:17,201
Yes!

1504
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:19,681
Look, he's doing the same thing.

1505
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,285
Yeah, he does, it looks that way.

1506
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:24,165
But I think he's got something
up his sleeve for you.

1507
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:38,647
Wow, beautiful.

1508
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:41,445
Yo, you going to see Rock?

1509
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:43,568
Yeah, let's go! We got you! Let's go!

1510
01:35:43,720 --> 01:35:45,484
Make history, Creed! Let's go!

1511
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:51,801
What up? Come on, y'all!
Let's ride! Come on!

1512
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:53,606
That's what I like, man!

1513
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:56,604
Let's go see Rock on Front Street!
Ride with me!

1514
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:47,245
You wanna say hello?

1515
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:50,805
Place looks like a church.

1516
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:52,405
Yeah, feel like an art museum.

1517
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:53,800
Yeah, beautiful.

1518
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:56,887
The fight starts in about two minutes.

1519
01:37:57,040 --> 01:37:59,088
As soon as he shows up,
he's gonna start on you.

1520
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:00,361
Okay.

1521
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:16,765
Don't let him get to you.

1522
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,803
Okay, great. Thank you all for coming.

1523
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:20,803
Let's get straight into questions.

1524
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:23,483
Uh, young lady to the left.

1525
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:26,644
Conlan, can we expect
any more fireworks at the weigh-in?

1526
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:28,370
I've been doing some
anger management classes

1527
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:30,488
and trying to control that temper of mine.

1528
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:32,927
I just gotta make sure he forgets it all
by Saturday night.

1529
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:37,011
Okay, next question.

1530
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:38,491
Young man in the glasses.

1531
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:40,762
What about the contrast between you two?

1532
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:44,163
You, the overnight success versus
Conlan's rags to riches background.

1533
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,686
Nothing happened overnight.

1534
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:47,171
I've been fighting for some time now...

1535
01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:48,685
That's exactly
how it happened for this guy.

1536
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:51,525
He's an overnight success,
never had a damn fight in his life.

1537
01:38:52,040 --> 01:38:54,520
He's got this shot because
he found that name last night.

1538
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:57,365
One more. There's a lot
of talk about legacy in this fight.

1539
01:38:57,520 --> 01:38:58,851
Johnson, can you speak to that?

1540
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,968
Yeah, I've been working on
trying to build my own legacy.

1541
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:03,641
Legacy? Are we at some
kind of comedy club?

1542
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:06,849
The guy next to him, now that's
what we're talking about legacy.

1543
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:08,371
- And I'm cut from that cloth.
- Don't fall for it.

1544
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:10,090
My father worked on the docks.

1545
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:12,409
His father was heavyweight
champion of the world.

1546
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:14,289
People like Silver Spoon over there...

1547
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:16,647
- You don't know nothing about me.
- I know enough about you.

1548
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:18,126
- I'm here now though.
- You found yourself here.

1549
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:19,281
- I'm here now.
- You a false Creed.

1550
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:20,965
All right, I'll show you right now.
My pops ain't here.

1551
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:22,121
Sit down!

1552
01:39:22,280 --> 01:39:23,486
You wanna fight here?
I'll do it right now!

1553
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:25,842
I can do it right now, bitch!
We can do it right now!

1554
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:29,608
- "Creed" my asshole!
- Keep it down!

1555
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:32,001
- Yo, you okay? Good?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

1556
01:39:32,440 --> 01:39:33,771
Okay, we'll see what's up.

1557
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:36,807
I'm gonna knock that smile off your face.

1558
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:45,208
Yo, Donnie, it's Rock.

1559
01:39:49,160 --> 01:39:50,924
Unc, you okay?

1560
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:53,321
Yeah, I'm good. Just couldn't sleep.

1561
01:39:53,480 --> 01:39:55,801
- Yeah, me either.
- Is it okay I sit down?

1562
01:39:55,960 --> 01:39:56,961
Course.

1563
01:39:58,240 --> 01:39:59,366
Donnie...

1564
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:03,369
I'd like you to do me a favor
when all this is over.

1565
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:05,045
- Yeah, anything.
- Okay, good.

1566
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:08,682
It's not important but just...
I wanna lock it in, okay?

1567
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:10,205
Yeah, you got it.

1568
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:11,731
There you go.

1569
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:16,371
You okay, huh?

1570
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:17,760
Yeah, why?

1571
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:21,044
No, you keep looking at the door.

1572
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:22,287
No!

1573
01:40:23,720 --> 01:40:25,165
Mmm-mmm.

1574
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:29,605
Do you hear something?

1575
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:31,201
No.

1576
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:35,450
Who is that?

1577
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:37,045
I don't know.

1578
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:45,931
How you doing, Bianca?
What are you doing here?

1579
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:48,641
Y'all two are killing me.

1580
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:53,489
Oh, and listen.
Would you guys just keep...

1581
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:54,766
We know.

1582
01:40:54,920 --> 01:40:56,001
- Leg thing.
- Yeah.

1583
01:40:56,160 --> 01:40:57,525
- The legs, yeah.
- It's important.

1584
01:40:57,680 --> 01:40:58,761
Got you.

1585
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:05,006
You wanna come in?

1586
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:07,007
Yeah.

1587
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:08,601
Please.

1588
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:25,007
- I got it.
- Good.

1589
01:41:25,160 --> 01:41:26,685
All right.

1590
01:41:28,280 --> 01:41:29,441
All right.

1591
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:35,010
A lot of room.

1592
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:37,808
Didn't we have enough
surprises for one weekend?

1593
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:40,091
That's not me.

1594
01:42:12,160 --> 01:42:14,049
Very nice colors.

1595
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:18,443
Why don't you take 'em into the other room
and see how well they fit.

1596
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:22,441
Yeah.

1597
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:25,921
Hey, champ.

1598
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:28,606
All right, Donnie. I'm proud of you.

1599
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:30,769
That's gonna bring him luck.

1600
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:56,127
You never been in front of
this many people before, right?

1601
01:42:56,280 --> 01:42:57,611
That don't matter.

1602
01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:59,888
You've never been this far away from home.

1603
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:01,326
That don't matter.

1604
01:43:01,480 --> 01:43:04,563
What matters is
what you leave in that ring

1605
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:06,609
and what you take back with you.

1606
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:08,245
You know what that is?

1607
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:11,364
Pride. And knowing that you did your best.

1608
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:13,290
And you're doing it for yourself.

1609
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:17,764
Not for me, not your father's memory,
but for you.

1610
01:43:18,120 --> 01:43:21,650
I can see in your eyes you're gonna do it.

1611
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:24,761
Let's go now.

1612
01:43:24,920 --> 01:43:26,126
Padman.

1613
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:31,650
Fight's right here.

1614
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:35,801
Let's go.

1615
01:43:39,640 --> 01:43:40,801
Yeah.

1616
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:42,611
Left hook combination.

1617
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:46,451
- Yeah.
- Come on, man. There you go!

1618
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:47,601
Go up top.

1619
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:51,010
All right, guys, it's time.

1620
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:52,929
Let's go win a championship!

1621
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:55,168
- It's time, baby.
- Let's go, guys.

1622
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:00,366
Come on, man.

1623
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:08,000
Let's go.

1624
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:27,888
I'd always get nervous during
times like this,

1625
01:44:28,040 --> 01:44:31,169
but that's normal,
and it's gonna give you energy.

1626
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:33,448
Pretty normal. Very normal.

1627
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:38,208
Go up there and show him who you are!

1628
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:44,570
Conlan!

1629
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:06,131
This is what you wanted, and what you got.

1630
01:46:06,280 --> 01:46:08,931
And I want you to enjoy it, okay? Do that.

1631
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:17,247
Conlan! Conlan!

1632
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:29,770
Hello again. I'm Jim Lampley.
Here comes Ricky Conlan.

1633
01:47:29,960 --> 01:47:33,362
100,000 on their feet
for what may conceivably be

1634
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:36,171
his last walk to the ring
for a professional fight.

1635
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:40,006
Max Kellerman, what chance
does the young American have?

1636
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:42,561
He's got the name.
That's why he's here tonight.

1637
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:44,290
Does he have the game?

1638
01:47:44,440 --> 01:47:47,523
He's Apollo Creed's son,
he's got Rocky Balboa in his corner.

1639
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:49,330
But all the legends in the world

1640
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:52,285
can't help him tonight if he can't fight.

1641
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:55,882
The question is, can he fight?

1642
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:21,924
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Goodison Park

1643
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:24,401
here in Liverpool, England,

1644
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:27,444
where tonight this is the main event.

1645
01:48:27,640 --> 01:48:29,608
Twelve rounds of boxing

1646
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:33,082
for the light heavyweight
championship of the world.

1647
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:35,561
For the thousands in attendance

1648
01:48:35,720 --> 01:48:38,326
and the millions
watching around the world,

1649
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:42,360
ladies and gentlemen,
let's get ready to rumble!

1650
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:49,844
In the red corner, wearing
the stars and stripes,

1651
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:54,204
his professional record,
16 fights 16 victories.

1652
01:48:54,360 --> 01:48:55,566
The challenger,

1653
01:48:55,720 --> 01:49:01,523
Adonis "Hollywood" Creed!

1654
01:49:01,720 --> 01:49:03,882
And fighting out of the blue corner,

1655
01:49:04,040 --> 01:49:05,644
wearing black with blue

1656
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:08,881
with 36 fights, 28 KOs,

1657
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:12,523
he's the light heavyweight
champion of the world,

1658
01:49:12,680 --> 01:49:19,290
"Pretty" Ricky Conlan!

1659
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:27,005
- Okay, let's go.
- Mmm-hmm.

1660
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:34,763
How you doing, lads?
You know what I expect of you both.

1661
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:36,291
We talked about it in the locker rooms.

1662
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:39,211
I want you to protect yourselves
and obey my commands at all times.

1663
01:49:39,400 --> 01:49:43,405
No low blows, no silly business.
Keep it clean, will you? Understand?

1664
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:44,921
Touch gloves.

1665
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:46,891
Nice shorts, boy.

1666
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:49,281
Too bad your daddy ain't here
to fight in them.

1667
01:49:50,760 --> 01:49:52,205
You know what?

1668
01:49:52,360 --> 01:49:55,091
You're gonna close his big mouth, okay?

1669
01:49:58,240 --> 01:49:59,685
- You know what to do.
- Mmm-hmm.

1670
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:02,241
One step, one punch, one round at a time.

1671
01:50:02,760 --> 01:50:03,886
You got this.

1672
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:17,970
Round one begins.

1673
01:50:18,120 --> 01:50:20,566
"Pretty" Ricky Conlan in the black trunks,

1674
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:23,963
and Adonis Creed
in the red, white and blue.

1675
01:50:24,120 --> 01:50:26,851
Conlan is significantly taller

1676
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,446
and thinks it will be easy to use his jab

1677
01:50:29,640 --> 01:50:31,449
to keep young Creed at bay.

1678
01:50:31,640 --> 01:50:32,641
You can see right away, Jim,

1679
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:35,201
how much more relaxed Conlan is.
He's been there before.

1680
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:36,407
Move your head!

1681
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:37,607
Keep your left up!

1682
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:40,570
That kind of nervous energy
can wear you out as the fight goes on.

1683
01:50:40,760 --> 01:50:42,842
Hard left hook by Conlan. Creed backs off.

1684
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,731
It's not easy to just jump right
into the major leagues like this,

1685
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:47,604
having never fought
an opponent like Conlan.

1686
01:50:47,800 --> 01:50:50,201
Of course, there aren't
many fighters like Conlan.

1687
01:50:50,360 --> 01:50:52,840
Creed trying to get close
to Conlan, against the ropes.

1688
01:50:53,160 --> 01:50:55,606
Conlan easily puts distance
between them again.

1689
01:50:56,360 --> 01:50:58,203
Creed lands a jab, Conlan grins at it.

1690
01:50:58,760 --> 01:51:01,969
Conlan fires a hard body punch,
hits him hard with a right cross

1691
01:51:02,120 --> 01:51:03,770
and backs Creed into the ropes.

1692
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:05,365
- Break!
- Ref, come on!

1693
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:06,601
Keep it clean!

1694
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:08,211
And he gets a warning from the referee.

1695
01:51:08,640 --> 01:51:11,810
Creed kinda woke him up with that shot
and Conlan really made him pay for it.

1696
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:14,244
Creed ready to let his hands go.

1697
01:51:15,640 --> 01:51:17,369
Creed misses and gets hit in return.

1698
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:19,530
To your corner! One!

1699
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:20,926
Perfect uppercut on the inside.

1700
01:51:21,080 --> 01:51:22,206
- Down goes Creed.
- Two!

1701
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:23,686
- Three! Four!
- I'm good. I'm good!

1702
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:24,921
- Five! Six!
- I'm good!

1703
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:26,361
Shake it off!

1704
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:28,528
But already a knockdown for Ricky Conlan.

1705
01:51:28,680 --> 01:51:29,806
- Are you okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

1706
01:51:29,960 --> 01:51:31,086
- Are you sure?
- I'm good!

1707
01:51:31,320 --> 01:51:32,367
Fight!

1708
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:39,049
Conlan lands a shot after the bell,
and round one was all Ricky Conlan.

1709
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:42,044
Real for you now, boy? Real for you now?

1710
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:47,130
- How's the eye?
- Little bloody.

1711
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:48,884
All right, look. Don't get rattled.

1712
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:50,121
I'm gonna knock his ass out.

1713
01:51:50,280 --> 01:51:51,770
Do it in the next round. Don't wait.

1714
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:53,365
You keep making mistakes like that,

1715
01:51:53,560 --> 01:51:55,324
we're gonna pick you up
with a vacuum cleaner, okay?

1716
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:57,887
Adonis was lucky there wasn't
another 30 seconds in that round.

1717
01:52:00,040 --> 01:52:01,883
Come on, baby. What you doing?

1718
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:03,725
Here's what I want you to do.

1719
01:52:03,880 --> 01:52:05,848
He's gonna jab and throw the right.

1720
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,731
When he leaves it out there,
drop that right hook and smash him, okay?

1721
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:10,211
Stay focused.

1722
01:52:10,360 --> 01:52:13,409
So round one was a forbidding
experience for young Adonis Creed.

1723
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:16,484
And now, after a discussion
with Rocky Balboa between rounds,

1724
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:18,051
he comes in for more.

1725
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:21,568
Conlan showed his power
with the uppercut at the end of round one,

1726
01:52:21,720 --> 01:52:24,200
goes back to boxing to begin the second.

1727
01:52:24,360 --> 01:52:26,362
- Be first!
- Keep the pressure on, Rick!

1728
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:30,730
Logic says Creed needs to find a way
to get inside of Conlan's long arms

1729
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:32,769
and create pressure on the inside.

1730
01:52:32,920 --> 01:52:33,921
Come on! Come on!

1731
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:36,162
So far, it's still mostly Ricky Conlan.

1732
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:39,164
Hard left hook for Conlan, uppercut.

1733
01:52:39,320 --> 01:52:40,446
Keep your hands up!

1734
01:52:40,600 --> 01:52:41,761
Drives Creed into the corner again.

1735
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:43,251
Tie him up!

1736
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:47,522
Creed wraps him up and
pulls him in to stop the onslaught.

1737
01:52:47,680 --> 01:52:49,444
You the champ, right, huh?

1738
01:52:49,600 --> 01:52:50,840
You the champ?

1739
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:52,411
Show me. Come on!

1740
01:52:54,520 --> 01:52:56,841
There's a perfect
right-hand shot by Creed!

1741
01:52:57,040 --> 01:52:58,405
- Yeah!
- Yes!

1742
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:04,409
Creed misses wildly,
and they are going toe-to-toe.

1743
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:06,289
Rapidly becoming a phone booth fight!

1744
01:53:06,440 --> 01:53:07,566
Go! Go!

1745
01:53:07,720 --> 01:53:09,609
Trading punches, right hand, left hand!

1746
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:10,881
Both guys landing!

1747
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:12,530
This is unbelievable action!

1748
01:53:12,720 --> 01:53:13,721
Double hook! Come on!

1749
01:53:14,120 --> 01:53:16,088
Hard right hand by Creed.

1750
01:53:16,240 --> 01:53:18,607
- You bleed just like me!
- Go to your corners! Come on!

1751
01:53:18,760 --> 01:53:19,761
You bleed just like me!

1752
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:22,048
Man! That ain't shit!

1753
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:25,966
He loves it! If Conlan thought
he had a pushover, he knows better now!

1754
01:53:26,120 --> 01:53:27,201
He bleed like me!

1755
01:53:27,400 --> 01:53:28,401
You belong in here!

1756
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:30,244
They don't know what you've been through

1757
01:53:30,400 --> 01:53:32,050
and they sure don't know
what we've been through.

1758
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:33,605
I don't want you trading blows with him.

1759
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:35,569
I want you to protect yourself.

1760
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:36,767
Keep your distance!

1761
01:53:36,920 --> 01:53:38,251
I'm gonna smash this kid to bits.

1762
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:40,243
Now he knows you're for real.

1763
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:41,561
You gotta believe you can do it.

1764
01:53:41,720 --> 01:53:43,722
That was such a big round for Creed.

1765
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:46,605
Not just on the scorecards
but psychologically going forward, Jim.

1766
01:53:46,760 --> 01:53:48,250
You woke up a sleeping giant.

1767
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:50,289
He's gonna come after you
with everything he's got.

1768
01:53:50,440 --> 01:53:52,920
Adonis, looking more and more
comfortable against the champ

1769
01:53:53,080 --> 01:53:55,082
seems to have found his rhythm.

1770
01:53:56,440 --> 01:53:57,601
Go finish him off.

1771
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:02,285
This has devolved into a slugfest!

1772
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:04,608
- One punch at a time!
- Come on, D!

1773
01:54:05,080 --> 01:54:07,447
Conlan trying to punish
Creed at short range.

1774
01:54:07,600 --> 01:54:08,761
Finish him now!

1775
01:54:08,920 --> 01:54:11,491
Big combination to end the third by Conlan

1776
01:54:11,640 --> 01:54:14,930
and Creed does not know where he is,
walking to the wrong corner there.

1777
01:54:15,080 --> 01:54:16,081
His arm is long.

1778
01:54:16,280 --> 01:54:18,442
Because you're playing his game, Donnie.

1779
01:54:18,600 --> 01:54:19,601
Be patient.

1780
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:21,489
One step, one punch.

1781
01:54:21,640 --> 01:54:23,130
- One round at a time.
- There you go.

1782
01:54:23,280 --> 01:54:25,521
One step, one punch,

1783
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:27,000
one round at a time.

1784
01:54:27,160 --> 01:54:29,811
Round five of a scheduled 12
and already it's a far different fight

1785
01:54:29,960 --> 01:54:31,121
than most experts expected.

1786
01:54:31,280 --> 01:54:32,281
He's just a pretender.

1787
01:54:32,440 --> 01:54:34,283
He's lucky to be in the same
ring with you hitting him.

1788
01:54:34,440 --> 01:54:35,441
Remember that.

1789
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:39,765
Adonis Creed has succeeded in pressuring
Ricky Conlan and making him fight.

1790
01:55:03,080 --> 01:55:04,889
Creed has proven plenty in this fight.

1791
01:55:05,080 --> 01:55:06,923
He's taken it, he's given it back.

1792
01:55:07,080 --> 01:55:08,809
But he does not look like a match

1793
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:10,843
for the best pound-for-pound
fighter in the world.

1794
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,287
You're going through hell out there
but you're hurting him, too.

1795
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:14,646
I can see it in his eyes.

1796
01:55:14,840 --> 01:55:16,330
You're not as far behind as you think.

1797
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:18,488
Shorten that jab, shorten the distance,

1798
01:55:18,680 --> 01:55:20,728
get underneath him,
and you'll be able to rip him.

1799
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:22,166
You gotta push him back.

1800
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:25,005
Most critics didn't think
Creed could make it this far.

1801
01:55:25,160 --> 01:55:26,286
Donnie, step under!

1802
01:55:28,440 --> 01:55:30,010
- Yes!
- Come on, Ricky!

1803
01:55:30,160 --> 01:55:32,606
There are moments when Creed
is assertively taking over.

1804
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:35,843
But there's a hard counter right,
drives Creed back into the corner.

1805
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,002
Just when it appears Creed
might be taking control

1806
01:55:38,200 --> 01:55:40,123
Conlan comes close to knocking him down.

1807
01:55:40,280 --> 01:55:41,361
Use that pressure.

1808
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:42,567
You are the one
that's in the driving seat.

1809
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:44,131
He's not used to this level, all right?

1810
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:45,691
Get 'em on the rope.

1811
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:47,410
Get 'em on the rope! Deep breath.

1812
01:55:47,560 --> 01:55:48,607
Boy's fast.

1813
01:55:48,760 --> 01:55:50,922
Hey! It's you against you.

1814
01:55:51,160 --> 01:55:52,525
- Me against me.
- That's right.

1815
01:55:52,680 --> 01:55:53,920
- He's just in your way.
- Got it.

1816
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:55,411
Get him out of the way! Let's go!

1817
01:55:55,560 --> 01:55:58,962
Not only is young
Adonis Creed still in the ring,

1818
01:55:59,120 --> 01:56:01,122
he may be in the fight.

1819
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,128
Hard left hand by Creed.

1820
01:56:05,400 --> 01:56:07,721
Conlan was an overwhelmingly
heavy favorite

1821
01:56:07,880 --> 01:56:11,726
pounding young Creed with right hands
as you saw right there.

1822
01:56:14,760 --> 01:56:16,410
Bring back everything
that's ever hurt you.

1823
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:19,643
All the pain you had inside,
everything that held you back.

1824
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:23,805
Put it in both fists, and I want you
to drive it through his body

1825
01:56:23,960 --> 01:56:26,247
and I promise you, his head will fall.

1826
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:29,802
We're into the part of the fight where
all your instincts come into play.

1827
01:56:30,040 --> 01:56:34,090
Most experts expected that Conlan
would avoid trading shots with Creed

1828
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:36,323
but he's trading willingly.

1829
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:37,925
Creed fires a hard body punch.

1830
01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:39,491
Conlan in trouble!

1831
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:41,644
- Hard left hand to the body.
- Oh, yeah!

1832
01:56:42,400 --> 01:56:44,129
The champ is in bad shape, Jim.

1833
01:56:44,280 --> 01:56:46,248
Creed realized he has a better chance

1834
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:48,607
of hurting Conlan to the
body than to the head!

1835
01:56:49,640 --> 01:56:50,687
- What an uppercut!
- No!

1836
01:56:51,640 --> 01:56:53,369
And Creed staggers back.

1837
01:56:53,680 --> 01:56:54,681
Body! Body!

1838
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:57,363
To the body, trading shots!

1839
01:56:57,520 --> 01:56:59,761
Pawing with his jab,
Creed looks to land one big shot.

1840
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:01,285
Move your legs!

1841
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:29,126
Donnie, get up!

1842
01:57:31,200 --> 01:57:32,361
Get up, D!

1843
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:35,201
Come on, baby.

1844
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:44,246
Stitch!

1845
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:53,410
Creed just got up

1846
01:57:53,560 --> 01:57:54,721
- like a man possessed.
- You okay? Look at me!

1847
01:57:54,920 --> 01:57:56,001
- He was out!
- Donnie!

1848
01:57:56,160 --> 01:57:58,686
Down but not out. Conlan thinks
he's celebrating a knockout.

1849
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:00,325
Get down! He's getting up!

1850
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:02,482
But the referee is dusting Creed's gloves.

1851
01:58:02,640 --> 01:58:03,721
You're good.

1852
01:58:03,880 --> 01:58:07,282
Creed beats the count
and the action begins again.

1853
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:08,885
That's the heart of a champion.

1854
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:10,644
He has his daddy's heart,
I'll tell you that much.

1855
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:12,006
Donnie, be ready!

1856
01:58:12,160 --> 01:58:15,209
More work to do for Conlan.
Body shot. Body shot.

1857
01:58:15,400 --> 01:58:17,050
Trying to set Creed up one more time.

1858
01:58:17,200 --> 01:58:18,565
Tie him up, for Christ's sake!

1859
01:58:21,880 --> 01:58:24,531
Stitch has done a great job
over that right eye

1860
01:58:24,680 --> 01:58:26,887
but now the left eye
looks like it's almost shut.

1861
01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:28,246
Closing up.

1862
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:30,291
- Rock, is he okay?
- You have to go back to...

1863
01:58:30,440 --> 01:58:31,851
Stay there, Bianca, it's okay.

1864
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:33,690
I'm cool, man, I'm cool!

1865
01:58:34,120 --> 01:58:35,201
I'm good.

1866
01:58:35,360 --> 01:58:36,361
- You're good?
- Yeah, man, all right?

1867
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:37,601
- You sure about that?
- I am. I'm good.

1868
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:40,206
He's taken a lot of punishment
to both the body and the head.

1869
01:58:40,360 --> 01:58:41,930
Left eye completely closed.

1870
01:58:42,080 --> 01:58:43,366
- I'm gonna stop this thing.
- No!

1871
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:44,885
Let me see the eye.

1872
01:58:45,200 --> 01:58:47,168
Time! Doc, give him a look!

1873
01:58:47,800 --> 01:58:49,723
All right. Show me your eye.

1874
01:58:49,880 --> 01:58:51,564
Show me your eye, Adonis!

1875
01:58:51,720 --> 01:58:53,051
How many fingers?

1876
01:58:53,400 --> 01:58:54,401
How many fingers?

1877
01:58:55,120 --> 01:58:56,281
How many, Adonis?

1878
01:58:56,480 --> 01:58:58,130
- Four.
- And again.

1879
01:58:59,240 --> 01:59:00,401
Two.

1880
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:02,167
Time in!

1881
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:03,970
All right. Breathe through your mouth.

1882
01:59:04,120 --> 01:59:06,043
Deep breaths, kid, deep.

1883
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:07,571
You are up on the cards,
you're winning this.

1884
01:59:07,720 --> 01:59:08,721
You are gonna win this!

1885
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:10,405
But just keep smart
and keep away from him.

1886
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:12,722
He's going to sleep this time.
He's going out this round.

1887
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:14,245
I should've stopped
the fight with your father.

1888
01:59:14,400 --> 01:59:15,606
I'm stopping this one now.

1889
01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:17,410
Don't, okay? Let me finish.

1890
01:59:18,080 --> 01:59:19,923
- I gotta prove it.
- Prove what?

1891
01:59:20,920 --> 01:59:22,160
I'm not a mistake.

1892
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:28,927
Look at me. I never got a chance
to thank Apollo

1893
01:59:29,080 --> 01:59:31,287
for helping me out after Mickey died.

1894
01:59:31,440 --> 01:59:33,602
But it's nothing compared
to what you've done.

1895
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:35,250
You taught me how to fight again

1896
01:59:35,400 --> 01:59:37,164
and I'm gonna go home
and I'm gonna fight this thing.

1897
01:59:37,320 --> 01:59:39,288
But if I fight, I want you to fight, too.

1898
01:59:39,480 --> 01:59:41,244
I want you to go across this ring

1899
01:59:41,440 --> 01:59:44,091
and knock that son of a bitch down.
Can you do it?

1900
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:45,847
Say it.

1901
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:47,525
I'm gonna knock that son of a bitch down.

1902
01:59:47,680 --> 01:59:48,920
I know you are. You know why?

1903
01:59:49,080 --> 01:59:50,923
Because you're a Creed
and I love you, kid.

1904
01:59:51,120 --> 01:59:52,121
- I love you too.
- Go on.

1905
01:59:52,280 --> 01:59:53,520
All right, baby, let's go.

1906
01:59:57,040 --> 01:59:58,451
Go get him, Donnie!

1907
02:00:02,160 --> 02:00:04,003
Round 12 begins.

1908
02:00:04,160 --> 02:00:07,960
Virtually no one outside of Adonis Creed's
family and group of friends

1909
02:00:08,120 --> 02:00:09,884
would ever have expected to see him

1910
02:00:10,040 --> 02:00:12,646
in a 12th round against
"Pretty" Ricky Conlan

1911
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:15,167
and trading shots as they come
to these last three minutes.

1912
02:00:16,720 --> 02:00:18,643
And there's a hard left hook upstairs.

1913
02:00:19,120 --> 02:00:20,121
Yeah!

1914
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:22,960
Every time you wanna say
it's the beginning of the end

1915
02:00:23,120 --> 02:00:26,488
the other guy comes through
with a shot you can't believe.

1916
02:00:27,120 --> 02:00:28,531
Hard right hand by Conlan.

1917
02:00:28,680 --> 02:00:30,045
Come on! Don't sit there!

1918
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:34,247
They're trading shots in the kind
of back and forth action

1919
02:00:34,520 --> 02:00:37,000
that most of us didn't expect to see.

1920
02:00:39,200 --> 02:00:42,880
Creed getting hit with some hard shots
but landing some of his own,

1921
02:00:43,040 --> 02:00:44,724
and Adonis is firing back!

1922
02:00:45,200 --> 02:00:47,043
Another pitched battle
between the two warriors.

1923
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:49,009
- Ricky, nail him!
- Come on, kid!

1924
02:00:51,160 --> 02:00:53,367
Creed spins, puts the champ in the corner!

1925
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:54,681
Body! Body!

1926
02:00:55,200 --> 02:00:57,851
Throwing body shots
like he's Rocky Balboa!

1927
02:00:58,160 --> 02:01:00,242
Going upstairs like he's Apollo Creed!

1928
02:01:00,440 --> 02:01:01,521
Knock his ass out!

1929
02:01:01,680 --> 02:01:03,523
Closing seconds of the fight!

1930
02:01:04,040 --> 02:01:05,087
Ricky!

1931
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:07,561
That's what I'm talking about!

1932
02:01:08,080 --> 02:01:09,525
Conlan is down!

1933
02:01:09,680 --> 02:01:13,082
That is the first time in his career
he's been on the canvas.

1934
02:01:13,280 --> 02:01:16,921
You cannot be saved by the bell
in the 12th and final round.

1935
02:01:17,600 --> 02:01:19,284
- Ricky, get up!
- Stay down!

1936
02:01:19,440 --> 02:01:21,044
- Stay down!
- Six!

1937
02:01:21,200 --> 02:01:22,690
- Dramatic count in Liverpool.
- Seven! Eight!

1938
02:01:22,840 --> 02:01:25,047
He must get up to preserve
his chance to win the fight.

1939
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:26,201
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

1940
02:01:26,360 --> 02:01:27,521
- Look at me!
- I'm all right!

1941
02:01:27,680 --> 02:01:28,681
- He's up!
- What?

1942
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:32,202
The bell sounds, so Conlan
survives the 12th round!

1943
02:01:32,360 --> 02:01:33,805
What a finish!

1944
02:01:33,960 --> 02:01:37,362
If that round goes another 30 seconds,
we may have a new champion.

1945
02:01:37,560 --> 02:01:40,723
An unforgettable fight
on an unforgettable night!

1946
02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:43,531
He's no longer just the namesake
of Apollo Creed,

1947
02:01:43,680 --> 02:01:45,409
he's the living embodiment.

1948
02:01:45,560 --> 02:01:46,561
Ladies and gentlemen,

1949
02:01:46,720 --> 02:01:50,725
a round of applause for
these two warriors in the ring!

1950
02:01:51,720 --> 02:01:54,041
To the winner by split decision

1951
02:01:56,160 --> 02:01:58,970
and still the undefeated
champion of the world...

1952
02:01:59,160 --> 02:02:00,571
You did great, kid.

1953
02:02:00,720 --> 02:02:02,290
"Pretty" Ricky Conlan!

1954
02:02:02,440 --> 02:02:03,566
Donnie, you were robbed.

1955
02:02:03,720 --> 02:02:06,291
If this fight had been
10 seconds longer...

1956
02:02:06,560 --> 02:02:07,846
10 seconds longer...

1957
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,001
Creed.

1958
02:02:12,920 --> 02:02:14,251
You go and get it, chum.

1959
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:15,765
You the future of this division.

1960
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:17,285
You wear that name with pride.

1961
02:02:17,760 --> 02:02:18,921
Respect.

1962
02:02:19,680 --> 02:02:22,570
Congratulations, Adonis,
on a sensational effort.

1963
02:02:22,760 --> 02:02:25,604
I just wanna thank my mom.
She's at home. I love you.

1964
02:02:25,760 --> 02:02:27,250
Even though I know she's
mad at me for doing this.

1965
02:02:27,480 --> 02:02:28,925
Hopefully I made her proud.

1966
02:02:29,080 --> 02:02:31,606
You almost gave me a heart
attack but I'm proud of you.

1967
02:02:31,760 --> 02:02:32,921
I got my family right here.

1968
02:02:33,080 --> 02:02:35,082
Without them,
none of this would've been possible.

1969
02:02:36,320 --> 02:02:40,211
Rocky, Apollo Creed's son
looks at you and says family.

1970
02:02:40,360 --> 02:02:41,361
What does that mean to you?

1971
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:44,603
It means I'm a lucky guy.
What can I say, right, kid?

1972
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:48,965
He's a real fighter,
and he's helping me fight a few things,

1973
02:02:49,120 --> 02:02:50,884
so I appreciate it. I really do.

1974
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:54,364
Adonis, I know you never met your father.

1975
02:02:54,520 --> 02:02:57,126
But if he was here tonight,
what would you wanna say to him?

1976
02:03:01,360 --> 02:03:03,601
I'll just tell him that I love him

1977
02:03:04,280 --> 02:03:06,647
and I know he didn't leave me on purpose.

1978
02:03:07,480 --> 02:03:10,484
And I'm proud to be a Creed.

1979
02:03:12,480 --> 02:03:16,690
Thanks, Adonis, and congratulations
on a sensational performance. Jim.

1980
02:03:16,880 --> 02:03:20,168
Creed! Creed! Creed!

1981
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:25,401
Go on.

1982
02:03:25,800 --> 02:03:28,167
Talk to them. Go on!

1983
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,162
This crowd is up on its feet.

1984
02:03:52,360 --> 02:03:54,362
No one wants to leave the arena.

1985
02:03:54,520 --> 02:03:57,649
Everyone in here knows
they've seen something special.

1986
02:03:57,800 --> 02:03:59,404
A fight they'll never forget.

1987
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:01,888
Ricky Conlan wins the fight.

1988
02:04:02,080 --> 02:04:04,606
Adonis Creed wins the night.

1989
02:04:24,720 --> 02:04:26,051
This is it?

1990
02:04:26,920 --> 02:04:27,967
Yeah.

1991
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:34,047
I just wanna see
if I can get up these steps.

1992
02:04:34,480 --> 02:04:35,891
When's the first time you came here?

1993
02:04:36,160 --> 02:04:37,730
I was 12.

1994
02:04:39,080 --> 02:04:41,560
I think it's my favorite place.

1995
02:04:47,400 --> 02:04:49,289
When you get to the top

1996
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:52,244
you think you can fly.

1997
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:12,251
Almost there.

1998
02:05:13,240 --> 02:05:14,765
You got this.

1999
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:23,286
Come on, young man.

2000
02:05:23,440 --> 02:05:24,521
Just let me catch my breath.

2001
02:05:24,680 --> 02:05:26,682
Come on, no breaks. We rest at the top.

2002
02:05:26,840 --> 02:05:28,205
Just a minute.

2003
02:05:28,760 --> 02:05:30,683
Nah, this is what you asked for, right?

2004
02:05:30,840 --> 02:05:32,763
Let's go. One step at a time.

2005
02:05:34,160 --> 02:05:35,366
Yeah.

2006
02:05:36,680 --> 02:05:37,886
Come on.

2007
02:05:39,880 --> 02:05:43,362
One step at a time. Who told you that?

2008
02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:44,961
Some old guy.

2009
02:05:45,120 --> 02:05:47,566
You know I meant that for you, not for me.

2010
02:05:50,640 --> 02:05:53,484
I think they added a few more steps.

2011
02:05:53,880 --> 02:05:56,360
- I don't know.
- Almost there.

2012
02:05:56,520 --> 02:05:57,965
I'm gonna take these last two.

2013
02:05:58,120 --> 02:05:59,690
One more step.

2014
02:05:59,880 --> 02:06:00,927
How you feeling?

2015
02:06:01,120 --> 02:06:03,646
Oh, good. Really good.

2016
02:06:09,480 --> 02:06:10,641
You all right there, old man?

2017
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:12,006
Yeah.

2018
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:14,490
Nice view.

2019
02:06:18,640 --> 02:06:22,645
If you look hard enough,
you can see your whole life from up here.

2020
02:06:22,840 --> 02:06:24,330
How does it look?

2021
02:06:24,480 --> 02:06:27,848
Not bad at all. And you?

2022
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:29,684
Not bad at all.

2023
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,321
You see this guy here staring back at you?

2024
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:58,684
That's your toughest opponent.

2025
02:12:00,360 --> 02:12:03,924
Every time you get into the ring,
that's who you're going against.

2026
02:12:04,760 --> 02:12:08,762
I believe that in boxing
and I do believe that in life, okay?

2027
02:12:10,680 --> 02:12:12,409
Nobody showed me how to do this.

2028
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:13,846
I'm ready.
