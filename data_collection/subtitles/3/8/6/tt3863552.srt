this honor wasn't suffiecient
for father, he was leader too

68
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:25,257
i wasn't interested in
any subject of father.

69
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:29,354
therefore he gave me
that name.. zero.

70
00:26:34,535 --> 00:26:38,335

i thought she's brahamman.

166
00:46:38,271 --> 00:46:41,365
she may be shatriya,
they eats meat and are white.

167
00:46:45,445 --> 00:46:47,276
