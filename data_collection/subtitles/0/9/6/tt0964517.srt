1
00:00:38,523 --> 00:00:40,754
Are you gonna...
You bringing Micky in?

2
00:00:40,765 --> 00:00:41,693
Yeah, he's here.

3
00:00:41,716 --> 00:00:43,771
He should come.
He should be here as well.

4
00:00:43,795 --> 00:00:45,920
We thought that Micky is
coming to answer the questions.

5
00:00:45,943 --> 00:00:48,142
No, they said it was
going to be both of us.

6
00:00:49,183 --> 00:00:53,034
- Am I looking right into the camera here?
- Just look at me right now.

7
00:00:53,046 --> 00:00:54,539
All right.

8
00:00:54,562 --> 00:00:57,718
You're not going to look
at the camera with the interviews?

9
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:03,567
I started boxing when I was
twelve years old

10
00:01:03,591 --> 00:01:06,185
and I lied and said I was eighteen
or whatever it was.

11
00:01:06,196 --> 00:01:08,110
I had a different name and everything.

12
00:01:08,122 --> 00:01:10,373
I mean, I don't have any fights,
I've done a hundred more than that

13
00:01:10,396 --> 00:01:12,936
before I turned professional.

14
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:14,790
This morning you said that...

15
00:01:14,801 --> 00:01:16,469
- Why are we doing this?
- One more time.

16
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,442
You want to go over it all?
You want to start again?

17
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:21,917
He's my younger brother.
I taught him everything he knows.

18
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:24,140
I'm still his trainer.
I know we've got different styles,

19
00:01:24,163 --> 00:01:28,297
I'm fucking squirelly as fuck.
You know, like, I'm not even there.

20
00:01:28,303 --> 00:01:32,925
That's what Sugar Ray said. I was the
most tricky fighter he'd ever come across.

21
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:38,340
'78, before Sugar Ray Leonard...
I told him he couldn't get to me.

22
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:40,066
He couldn't get to me.

23
00:01:40,085 --> 00:01:43,009
They called me "The Pride of Lowell."

24
00:01:43,026 --> 00:01:45,809
Everybody still talks about it,
you know, especially my brother.

25
00:01:45,823 --> 00:01:48,207
His whole life he wanted to do
what I did, you know?

26
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,555
But we're very different fighters.

27
00:01:50,561 --> 00:01:56,326
Micky's a heavy hitter.
He's thunderous, I'm telling you.

28
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:58,156
Thunderous left punch.

29
00:01:58,179 --> 00:02:01,666
Micky, he takes a punishment.
I don't know why he does it.

30
00:02:01,681 --> 00:02:03,865
I'd say "You all right?"
He likes getting on the inside.

31
00:02:03,877 --> 00:02:05,392
I stay on the outside.

32
00:02:34,884 --> 00:02:35,919
Come on!

33
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:38,653
Dicky...

34
00:02:43,773 --> 00:02:45,528
Would you come on?

35
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:48,429
Stop.
You've got to help me finish this.

36
00:02:51,803 --> 00:02:52,919
Come on!

37
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:55,129
Unpredictable as ever!

38
00:02:55,153 --> 00:02:58,108
You don't have to be Columbo
to see where this fight is headed!

39
00:02:58,699 --> 00:03:00,660
Yeah, bam!

40
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:03,547
All right, he punched Micky Ward down!

41
00:03:03,572 --> 00:03:07,717
HBO's making a movie on me and
my comeback and my brother

42
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:12,378
is going to beat Saoul Mamby
in Atlanta next week!

43
00:03:12,398 --> 00:03:16,231
The Pride of Lowell is back!

44
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:18,432
Quacker!

45
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,034
Who wants some?
Who wants some?

46
00:03:21,154 --> 00:03:26,370
Sync, corrected by icephoenix
www.addic7ed.com

47
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,321
I want a cut.

48
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:49,494
Doing good?

49
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,561
You guys having a good day?

50
00:03:51,973 --> 00:03:53,365
How are you?

51
00:03:54,223 --> 00:03:59,119
Come on. Come on. What you got?
What you got going on?

52
00:03:59,638 --> 00:04:02,241
Lou! Hey, Lou DiBella!

53
00:04:02,245 --> 00:04:05,075
How are you guys, huh?

54
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:11,182
I'm making my comeback.

55
00:04:12,031 --> 00:04:14,421
Hey, Marty, Marty.
Come out here, huh?

56
00:04:30,787 --> 00:04:32,302
Hey!

57
00:04:32,308 --> 00:04:35,537
HBO is making a movie on me!

58
00:04:36,036 --> 00:04:37,245
Hey, beautiful.

59
00:04:43,743 --> 00:04:45,354
You got that?

60
00:04:45,362 --> 00:04:48,857
Can't remember who she is.
I can't remember shit!

61
00:04:48,877 --> 00:04:51,495
Hey!
Hey, Garcia!

62
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,389
How are you, nice?

63
00:04:55,088 --> 00:04:57,468
How'd you get here?
Drive around?

64
00:04:57,484 --> 00:05:00,564
Hey, Ray. Hey.
I love you, Ray.

65
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:02,804
This is what it's all about.

66
00:05:28,376 --> 00:05:29,456
He make mistake?

67
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,659
No, he'll be here.
Like I said,

68
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:34,289
sometimes he goes on his own schedule,
but when he gets here we work hard.

69
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:36,227
Nobody pushes me harder than him.

70
00:05:36,238 --> 00:05:38,934
He's supposed to be
training you right now, right?

71
00:05:38,948 --> 00:05:40,766
Why don't you just go talk to them,
my sisters?

72
00:05:40,778 --> 00:05:42,985
They'll talk your ear off.
You gotta pay them to shut up.

73
00:05:42,997 --> 00:05:45,483
He can tell you how
Dicky was helping him.

74
00:05:45,485 --> 00:05:48,167
Come on, Micky.

75
00:05:48,287 --> 00:05:49,145
Okay.

76
00:05:50,897 --> 00:05:52,450
Hey, we don't know where Dicky is.

77
00:05:52,461 --> 00:05:54,282
You know where he is.

78
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,435
What's that dumb cop doing in there?

79
00:06:13,446 --> 00:06:15,243
Where's Dicky?
Girls?

80
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:17,032
- I don't know.
- You see him this morning?

81
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,098
Your brother?
Not this morning.

82
00:06:19,117 --> 00:06:21,347
Look at Mom!
All dressed up for the movie, huh?

83
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:24,012
You are smoking hot!

84
00:06:24,132 --> 00:06:27,143
Get out of the ring, O'Keefe.
My Dicky should be doing that.

85
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,059
Dicky ain't here, Alice.

86
00:06:29,883 --> 00:06:33,194
Micky's got an important fight
coming up and he's not training.

87
00:06:33,206 --> 00:06:35,014
- Forget about him. Never mind about him.
- He's not doing what he's supposed to do with him.

88
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:37,908
- Start saying to Micky...
- He's not part of this, all right?

89
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,315
- Alice, he's not being handled right.
- Did you get me coming in all right?

90
00:06:40,326 --> 00:06:42,640
You want me to do it again?
Get out of the ring, O'Keefe.

91
00:06:42,657 --> 00:06:45,017
- Dicky's the trainer.
- I'm doing him favor, Alice.

92
00:06:45,023 --> 00:06:47,121
I will show you over here

93
00:06:47,144 --> 00:06:50,479
these scrapbooks I have been
collecting for years.

94
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,301
Micky used to follow
his big brother everywhere.

95
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:55,380
Taught you everything, didn't he, honey?

96
00:06:55,392 --> 00:06:59,779
In '78 we got the offer
to fight Sugar Ray Leonard.

97
00:06:59,798 --> 00:07:02,464
Oh, my God. Have you seen that video?
Well, you're from HBO,

98
00:07:02,475 --> 00:07:05,727
you've got to see it again!
Come on. Where's the video at?

99
00:07:11,703 --> 00:07:15,652
<i>Tonight my son is going to surprise
everybody and beat Sugar Ray Leonard.</i>

100
00:07:15,664 --> 00:07:17,697
<i>Believe me. I know it.</i>

101
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:21,821
<i>Sugar Ray might have some trouble tonight.</i>

102
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:25,354
<i>That's a good possibility.
He comes in here against a good boxer,</i>

103
00:07:25,365 --> 00:07:27,350
<i>a young man who can punch,</i>

104
00:07:27,373 --> 00:07:31,280
<i>and I would like to say at this time
that physically they're just about equal.</i>

105
00:07:49,441 --> 00:07:53,276
<i>Leonard is down.
Let's see if that's a knockout.</i>

106
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:57,141
<i>This is unbelievable.</i>

107
00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:03,584
<i>Eklund just walked over there.
Nobody seems to know what's happening.</i>

108
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,058
Dicky did it.

109
00:08:11,763 --> 00:08:12,695
Dicky did it.

110
00:08:14,884 --> 00:08:15,917
Dicky did it!

111
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:18,171
Aren't you supposed to be
training Micky right now?

112
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,716
No, it ain't until 9:00.

113
00:08:19,726 --> 00:08:22,204
Dicky, it's fucking 11:45.

114
00:08:22,227 --> 00:08:25,166
- It's 11:45, Dick.
- What?

115
00:08:25,176 --> 00:08:27,396
Where'd you fucking
park the car, Boo Boo?

116
00:08:27,413 --> 00:08:29,551
- I didn't park it. You did.
- Huh?

117
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:32,273
Check your fucking pockets for the keys.
You've got the keys, huh?

118
00:08:32,285 --> 00:08:34,015
I didn't park it, man.

119
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:36,449
- Not here. I don't know...
- Check your pockets, all right?

120
00:08:36,471 --> 00:08:40,780
Oh, fuck it, I'll run.
I need the fucking road work.

121
00:08:40,804 --> 00:08:43,939
Road work?
Are you crazy?

122
00:08:43,962 --> 00:08:45,492
He's a great runner.

123
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:12,210
Hey.

124
00:09:13,343 --> 00:09:14,412
Hey!

125
00:09:16,314 --> 00:09:18,475
- I'm here!
- Hey, Dicky.

126
00:09:18,496 --> 00:09:20,464
Better late than never.

127
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:22,603
Here, look.

128
00:09:22,615 --> 00:09:24,500
Detectives on the scene...

129
00:09:27,321 --> 00:09:29,801
Get to the bar with this...

130
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,765
- Figure this one out, huh?
- Why don't you...

131
00:09:33,945 --> 00:09:35,788
Hold it. Hold it.
Let me get this straight.

132
00:09:35,812 --> 00:09:39,049
You guys are working in the same corner
as Micky, together, right?

133
00:09:39,072 --> 00:09:41,517
Yeah.
Yeah, they're both in my corner.

134
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,523
- This is what goes on.
- Okay. It must be...

135
00:09:43,546 --> 00:09:45,635
Don't you have a job to
go to or something?

136
00:09:45,646 --> 00:09:48,347
Really, O'Keefe has a job
that he should be at.

137
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,961
Yeah, Sergeant O'Keefe's
working overtime here.

138
00:09:50,969 --> 00:09:55,455
So we go at this old man:
Jewish, black, former world champion.

139
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:57,251
I think we've got
all the bases covered.

140
00:09:57,274 --> 00:10:01,642
And my kid brother,
he's lost three fights in a row.

141
00:10:01,654 --> 00:10:03,697
He can't get used to losing.
It's a mental thing.

142
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:06,245
But we're gonna break that
with Mamby, right?

143
00:10:06,258 --> 00:10:07,843
Yeah, I hope.
When we can train.

144
00:10:07,867 --> 00:10:10,509
When we train. Right.
Don't be wasting time, Mick, you know?

145
00:10:10,525 --> 00:10:12,181
- Wasting time?
- Half the fucking day's gone.

146
00:10:12,204 --> 00:10:15,814
Yeah, half the day's gone.
I've been waiting for you.

147
00:10:46,318 --> 00:10:50,050
Come on, move.
We're going to outbox Mamby, huh?

148
00:10:51,712 --> 00:10:55,305
- Take it out on the head.
- Head, body, head. That's your combo.

149
00:10:55,328 --> 00:10:57,913
Head, body, head, body.
My Dicky taught him that.

150
00:10:57,936 --> 00:11:00,353
You know,
Sugar Ray's going to be there

151
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,661
calling the fight for ESPN.

152
00:11:03,387 --> 00:11:06,569
I ain't seen him since
I knocked him down,

153
00:11:06,587 --> 00:11:09,629
like, fourteen years ago
or something, right?

154
00:11:11,264 --> 00:11:13,483
Let's get a real sparring going on here.

155
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,444
Don't want to embarrass yourself.

156
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:18,174
Don't want to embarrass yourself
in front of Sugar Ray, huh?

157
00:11:18,727 --> 00:11:20,449
Come on, head, body, head.

158
00:11:23,368 --> 00:11:24,941
Your punch, man!

159
00:11:25,328 --> 00:11:29,755
That's your punch. Now that's your little punch.
Use your whole fucking body now.

160
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:33,921
George's fingers are so fucking big
he can't even dial the phone!

161
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,812
That's not helping, George!

162
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,581
- Wait, I'm confused.
- What?

163
00:11:41,604 --> 00:11:43,518
- I'm confused, too.
- We're confused.

164
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,879
- George is whose father?
- You're confused?

165
00:11:45,902 --> 00:11:51,207
Dick Eklund Sr. is Dicky's,
Donna's, Gail's and Phyllis' father.

166
00:11:51,214 --> 00:11:52,916
- Dick Eklund.
- Yeah.

167
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,274
And even though Alice is an Eklund,
so are Cindy and Cathy.

168
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,270
George is really...

169
00:11:58,292 --> 00:12:00,452
- And Micky...
- No.

170
00:12:00,474 --> 00:12:02,305
Micky and I are Wards.

171
00:12:03,151 --> 00:12:07,281
It's always sounded like Dick Eklund
and I were separated, right?

172
00:12:07,304 --> 00:12:09,629
- And then there was George.
- Just George.

173
00:12:09,641 --> 00:12:12,083
- George is my man.
- George is our papa.

174
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,797
After Dick, it was just George.

175
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:27,009
Come on.
Come over here...

176
00:12:45,243 --> 00:12:48,677
Why don't you just go talk to her?
She's a nice girl.

177
00:12:48,689 --> 00:12:50,435
I told her all about you.

178
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,040
I don't want to ask her.
She's going to say no.

179
00:12:55,412 --> 00:12:57,475
Can't beat that ass, can you?

180
00:12:58,113 --> 00:13:00,378
Get at it. Go.
Come on.

181
00:13:08,786 --> 00:13:11,229
Are you just going to stand there
and stare at my ass?

182
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,259
Your father stares at my ass
but he talks to me.

183
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,898
He thinks you're the greatest.

184
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:19,669
- He didn't tell me you were new.
- Keep the change, doll.

185
00:13:19,693 --> 00:13:21,371
He told me you came for you sister.

186
00:13:21,381 --> 00:13:23,166
- This is a tip?
- Yeah, that's my tip!

187
00:13:23,188 --> 00:13:25,099
You know what the bell says
about this one?

188
00:13:25,118 --> 00:13:27,807
Cheap bastard.
Cheap fucker.

189
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,580
Comes in every day,
gives me shitty tips.

190
00:13:30,603 --> 00:13:32,279
Yeah, fuck you, too.

191
00:13:33,909 --> 00:13:35,905
You pave streets, right?

192
00:13:35,928 --> 00:13:37,725
Yeah, I do. And I'm a fighter.

193
00:13:37,749 --> 00:13:39,803
Oh, yeah. I heard you're a stepping stone.

194
00:13:39,827 --> 00:13:42,222
- I'm no stepping stone.
- Mm.

195
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,410
You're the guy they use

196
00:13:45,526 --> 00:13:47,710
against the other fighters
to move the other fighters up.

197
00:13:47,725 --> 00:13:49,956
I've had a few tough fights,
but that's not who I am.

198
00:13:49,968 --> 00:13:52,390
The next fight's going to show who I am.

199
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,648
Yeah, and he's going to
lose that one, too.

200
00:13:54,671 --> 00:13:57,478
Scotch and soda, Charlene.
And one for yourself.

201
00:13:57,489 --> 00:13:59,979
Now move that sugar ass...

202
00:14:01,837 --> 00:14:04,256
Okay, be respectful.
Don't disrespect her.

203
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:07,150
Hey, don't hurt your hand.
You've got a fight next week.

204
00:14:07,162 --> 00:14:09,087
Besides,
you wipe your ass with that one.

205
00:14:09,112 --> 00:14:11,907
Don't wait up, or I'm going to hit
you in the car, sucker, all right?

206
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:14,232
He's gonna be so lame.

207
00:14:15,194 --> 00:14:17,296
All right?
All right?

208
00:14:18,803 --> 00:14:19,825
That's right.

209
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,784
Take your drink.
He's taking his drink.

210
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,167
This guy's going to be champion.
He's a great guy. He's a great fighter.

211
00:14:26,186 --> 00:14:28,726
Okay? Hold on.
Thanks for the drink.

212
00:14:28,749 --> 00:14:31,074
You know those cameras
are making a movie about him?

213
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:32,933
He knocked out Sugar Ray Leonard

214
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:35,293
on HBO. That's why they're following
him around with the cameras.

215
00:14:35,318 --> 00:14:37,219
They're making a movie
about his comeback.

216
00:14:37,231 --> 00:14:40,202
Yeah, everybody's talking about it.
But who are you fighting?

217
00:14:40,225 --> 00:14:42,820
- Saoul Mamby.
- Saoul Mamby?

218
00:14:42,837 --> 00:14:45,206
- What kind of name is that?
- Black and Jewish.

219
00:14:46,298 --> 00:14:48,012
Where did they find a guy like that?

220
00:14:48,026 --> 00:14:50,174
He's no joke.
Former world champion.

221
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:52,051
- Former champ?
- Yeah.

222
00:14:52,546 --> 00:14:54,583
- I match up good with him, though.
- Yeah?

223
00:14:54,595 --> 00:14:56,658
- Yeah.
- What does that mean?

224
00:14:56,675 --> 00:14:58,730
Well, I got a light end, you know?

225
00:14:58,749 --> 00:15:00,890
I've got a reputation for brawling,
but I'm not going to brawl with him.

226
00:15:00,902 --> 00:15:03,603
- I'm going to try to box him.
- There's a difference?

227
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,596
Yeah, in brawling you slug it out.
I hit you. You hit me.

228
00:15:06,607 --> 00:15:08,263
Boxing is a chess game, you know?

229
00:15:08,285 --> 00:15:10,140
Got to pick my punches
to take him down.

230
00:15:10,152 --> 00:15:12,209
I'm going head, body, head, body...

231
00:15:13,363 --> 00:15:15,294
What is head, body, head, body?

232
00:15:15,318 --> 00:15:19,169
Well, I hit him in the head, then his
hands got to go up to protect himself.

233
00:15:19,187 --> 00:15:23,694
Opens up his body, then I hit him in the body,
hand goes back down. I go back up to the head,

234
00:15:23,718 --> 00:15:25,796
hand goes back, and I hit him in the body.

235
00:15:25,808 --> 00:15:28,720
People who don't know fighting think
you do a lot of damage hitting the head,

236
00:15:28,731 --> 00:15:31,139
but you actually do more hitting the body.

237
00:15:32,294 --> 00:15:34,099
So what do you think?
Can I take you out?

238
00:15:37,408 --> 00:15:39,068
Are you married?

239
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,002
No, would I ask you out if I was married?
What kind of guy do you think I am?

240
00:15:42,022 --> 00:15:43,612
Happens all the time, trust me.

241
00:15:43,624 --> 00:15:45,005
I'm not like that.

242
00:15:46,244 --> 00:15:48,416
I'm not married. I've got a daughter,
I see her every other weekend.

243
00:15:48,428 --> 00:15:50,224
Her name is Kasie.
But that's it.

244
00:15:51,178 --> 00:15:52,922
Come on, let me take you out.

245
00:15:55,028 --> 00:15:56,350
When?

246
00:15:56,848 --> 00:15:58,693
Saturday night I'll be
back in Atlantic City.

247
00:16:16,038 --> 00:16:17,511
Is this the real number?

248
00:16:17,534 --> 00:16:19,380
You'll have to call it and see.

249
00:16:19,401 --> 00:16:20,714
I will.

250
00:16:20,726 --> 00:16:22,593
Saturday. Dinner and a movie.

251
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,302
- Hey. What's up?
- Dicky, hey. How's it going?

252
00:16:47,325 --> 00:16:49,371
I don't think Laurie's
expecting you right now.

253
00:16:49,394 --> 00:16:52,906
What's he doing here?
This isn't your visitation day, Micky.

254
00:16:53,768 --> 00:16:55,929
I just want to say hi to Kasie.

255
00:16:55,944 --> 00:16:57,611
It's not your day, goodbye.

256
00:16:57,624 --> 00:16:59,560
Yeah, but I'm not around next week.

257
00:16:59,572 --> 00:17:01,298
Now you're ditching
the days you do have?

258
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:03,130
No, I have a fight.
I told you that.

259
00:17:06,251 --> 00:17:08,717
- Jimmy...
- I can't get in the middle.

260
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:11,930
I can't talk to her, okay?
So I'm asking you, Jimmy.

261
00:17:11,951 --> 00:17:14,350
I want to talk to my daughter now.

262
00:17:14,374 --> 00:17:16,828
- Talk to your father.
- God damn it, Jimmy.

263
00:17:16,851 --> 00:17:18,940
Hi, Daddy.
Daddy's gonna beat Saoul Mamby.

264
00:17:18,963 --> 00:17:22,897
That's right. And I'm gonna tell you that
after I win, I'm gonna start making big money.

265
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:25,175
And I'll move into a bigger apartment,
like we talked about,

266
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,559
- so you can live with me more days, okay?
- Yeah, a bigger apartment!

267
00:17:27,582 --> 00:17:30,060
- Wish me luck, all right?
- Don't hold your breath, Kasie.

268
00:17:30,647 --> 00:17:32,343
It's cruel to mislead your child, Micky.

269
00:17:32,356 --> 00:17:35,807
- Good luck, Daddy.
- Thanks, Kasie. I love you, honey.

270
00:17:35,819 --> 00:17:37,087
Bye, baby.

271
00:17:39,044 --> 00:17:42,993
- Where is he?
- Jesus Christ. Fucking holding us up.

272
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:54,163
- Quit your worrying, for crying out loud.
- All that shit in my face...

273
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:57,745
I know it's none of my business.
I go to a lot of meetings,

274
00:17:57,768 --> 00:18:00,861
and they have a saying:
"Let go and let God."

275
00:18:00,885 --> 00:18:03,265
- You've got to let him go, Mick.
- He's taught me everything I know.

276
00:18:03,277 --> 00:18:06,130
He's been in my corner.
I can't do it without him.

277
00:18:06,146 --> 00:18:09,314
- You're already doing it without him.
- No I'm not.

278
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,083
- Yes you are.
- Look, you know where he is.

279
00:18:11,095 --> 00:18:13,496
Why don't you just go get him?

280
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:14,952
Can you get him?

281
00:18:14,963 --> 00:18:16,607
I'm not fucking going to get him.

282
00:18:16,631 --> 00:18:19,761
Well are we all going to go over there
in the limo with Alice? We can't do that.

283
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:30,408
Dicky.

284
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:35,790
- Your mother's outside.
- What?

285
00:18:35,805 --> 00:18:39,416
Uh-oh, Dicky, your mother's outside.
She's down there.

286
00:18:43,693 --> 00:18:45,227
I'm not here.

287
00:18:50,946 --> 00:18:53,189
Don't, Dicky.
Dicky!

288
00:18:58,015 --> 00:19:00,469
What the fuck are you doing?
You know we've got to go to the airport now.

289
00:19:00,488 --> 00:19:02,179
We've got a flight to catch.

290
00:19:02,187 --> 00:19:04,402
You know how important this fight is to me.

291
00:19:05,364 --> 00:19:08,053
- Don't tell Mom I'm here, all right?
- She knows.

292
00:19:08,074 --> 00:19:10,821
- Pick me up back at the house, all right?
- Are you fucking...

293
00:19:10,844 --> 00:19:12,382
She's in the driveway right now.

294
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,396
All right, but hurry up.
She's in the fucking driveway.

295
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:18,827
- We've got a flight to catch.
- You do this on the day your brother's traveling?

296
00:19:20,651 --> 00:19:22,647
- What are you doing?
- Just trying to see what I have.

297
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:24,791
- The fuck did you hit him for?
- Why'd you make me do that to you?

298
00:19:24,814 --> 00:19:25,953
- Jesus!
- Oh, my God, Dicky...

299
00:19:25,977 --> 00:19:27,738
I was on my way, Mom.

300
00:19:27,753 --> 00:19:29,655
- What are you doing?
- No, Mom. Mom...

301
00:19:31,146 --> 00:19:34,306
Why can't we just go to the
fucking airport for once, please?

302
00:19:35,198 --> 00:19:37,876
Hey, Alice, what about your husband who's
laying on the fucking ground over here?

303
00:19:37,899 --> 00:19:39,449
You want to help your husband?

304
00:19:39,459 --> 00:19:42,289
What are you doing, running in here
like a silverback fucking gorilla?

305
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,917
- We had to get him, didn't we?
- Oh, yeah, you got him, pal.

306
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:06,108
You see Mamby?

307
00:20:06,131 --> 00:20:09,630
See how Mamby's arm comes up?
Leaves his side open,

308
00:20:09,647 --> 00:20:11,959
you just play him up like a pinball machine.

309
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:15,246
He'll be pissing blood.
No way you'll lose, Mick. No way.

310
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,591
- Hey, Lou.
- Dicky, boy.

311
00:20:16,603 --> 00:20:18,446
Hey listen, boy.

312
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,219
ESPN can't get us better rooms than this?

313
00:20:20,227 --> 00:20:22,951
I wouldn't worry about the rooms right now,
Dicky. You've got bigger headaches.

314
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,455
Like what?

315
00:20:24,467 --> 00:20:27,132
The doctor won't let Mamby fight.

316
00:20:27,155 --> 00:20:28,417
Why not?

317
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,777
- He's got the flu.
- Mamby got the flu?

318
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,712
Yeah.

319
00:20:31,736 --> 00:20:33,285
Dicky, we can still have a fight.

320
00:20:33,297 --> 00:20:36,190
- With who?
- Mike Mungin.

321
00:20:36,213 --> 00:20:37,681
Mike Mungin, who's that?

322
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:41,142
- Guy from Philly. Been in prison.
- He's been out a few months.

323
00:20:41,155 --> 00:20:44,830
I've called everybody, checked everywhere.
He's the only guy I could find.

324
00:20:44,854 --> 00:20:47,672
My last three fights were rough, Lou.
I mean this one's supposed to be easier.

325
00:20:47,696 --> 00:20:49,664
We've been fucking preparing for Mamby.

326
00:20:49,675 --> 00:20:53,104
Right, but this guy just came off the couch.
He's been sitting on his ass.

327
00:20:53,116 --> 00:20:55,816
Could be an easy win for Mick.

328
00:20:55,829 --> 00:20:58,710
Joey Farrell, remember him?
He knocked his ass out.

329
00:20:58,733 --> 00:21:02,535
- And you knocked down Joey Farrell...
- Exactly, and Mungin just got off the couch.

330
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,485
Can't make weight.
Might be a bit over, though.

331
00:21:04,507 --> 00:21:05,657
How over?

332
00:21:05,668 --> 00:21:09,028
- 162, 165...
- 165?

333
00:21:09,744 --> 00:21:12,092
Micky dropped weight.
He's 146.

334
00:21:12,103 --> 00:21:15,737
Lou, we prepared for Mamby, all right?
We prepared for Mamby!

335
00:21:15,754 --> 00:21:18,889
This guy just got off the couch.
Micky's in shape.

336
00:21:18,906 --> 00:21:22,182
Road work, everything else.
This other guy hasn't done dick.

337
00:21:22,189 --> 00:21:25,418
Don't forget.
You don't fight, nobody gets paid.

338
00:21:33,433 --> 00:21:36,580
Lou, please...

339
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:40,721
All right. Um,
Joey Farrell knocked him out...

340
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,494
Going to be a hell of a fight, huh?

341
00:21:42,505 --> 00:21:44,778
I'm not doing this.
165 is big.

342
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:47,738
- You knocked down Joey Farrell.
- So what? He's a middleweight.

343
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:49,583
He just got off the couch.

344
00:21:49,606 --> 00:21:52,013
He's got twenty pounds on me, Dicky.

345
00:21:52,037 --> 00:21:54,936
Joey Farrell knocked him out.
You knocked down Joey Farrell.

346
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,091
- You just said that.
- Yeah but... You can't be scared.

347
00:21:58,103 --> 00:21:59,089
- Scared?
- Yeah.

348
00:21:59,112 --> 00:22:01,061
- Why don't you go fucking fight him?
- I'll go fucking fight him. He's fat.

349
00:22:01,073 --> 00:22:04,678
Go snap out the teeth. It's your big comeback,
right? That's what Alice wants.

350
00:22:04,695 --> 00:22:07,372
You knocked down Joey Farrell.

351
00:22:07,381 --> 00:22:10,657
All right, I knocked down Joey Farrell, okay?
But the guy is a middleweight.

352
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,729
I'm a welterweight. What, they don't have
a fucking heavyweight to tow in there with me?

353
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,406
Tell him, Dicky. He can do it, right?
He can do anything.

354
00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:18,967
Yeah, Alice. No problem.

355
00:22:18,988 --> 00:22:21,581
You watch from the outside now.

356
00:22:21,593 --> 00:22:26,830
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mike "Machine Gun" Mungin!

357
00:22:28,526 --> 00:22:30,184
Holy shit!

358
00:22:30,765 --> 00:22:33,296
Hey, look.
There's Sugar Ray Leonard.

359
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,053
Hey, Ray. Sugar Ray.
Over here.

360
00:22:37,077 --> 00:22:40,052
Dicky, come on.
Look at the size of that guy.

361
00:22:41,128 --> 00:22:43,277
- Holy shit.
- Yeah, holy shit.

362
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:45,929
That guy's no welterweight.

363
00:22:45,954 --> 00:22:48,784
All right, Mick. Gonna have to learn
to fuss you around. It's time now.

364
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:52,301
He did not just get off the fucking couch.
If he did, I want to buy a couch like that.

365
00:22:52,313 --> 00:22:55,553
I don't care who that guy is.
I don't care. Look at me.

366
00:22:55,565 --> 00:22:59,162
You're Micky Ward.
You're Micky Ward.

367
00:23:02,502 --> 00:23:05,534
Micky Ward fighting a last-minute
replacement from Philadelphia,

368
00:23:05,546 --> 00:23:08,246
a much bigger man.

369
00:23:08,255 --> 00:23:11,730
Punches smashing Ward.

370
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:17,002
Ward goes down!
Ward goes down!

371
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:25,539
Micky, what the fuck is wrong?
Get rid of this dude!

372
00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:31,041
Mungin didn't even know
he'd be fighting today...

373
00:23:35,185 --> 00:23:36,977
Come on, now, Mick!

374
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:43,183
Ward, a respected fighter. You hope
this mismatch doesn't hurt his confidence.

375
00:23:43,195 --> 00:23:45,531
- You're a loser!
- Loser!

376
00:23:45,532 --> 00:23:47,422
You're a loser!

377
00:24:17,304 --> 00:24:20,018
Ray! Hey, Ray! Ray!

378
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:24,196
Hey, Dicky!

379
00:24:24,207 --> 00:24:27,656
- How are you doing, man?
- How are you?

380
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:31,049
165 pounds. ESPN screwed us.

381
00:24:31,061 --> 00:24:34,149
- The guy was huge.
- You know what I'm saying?

382
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,741
You know, I knocked Ray down.

383
00:24:36,765 --> 00:24:39,242
I look like shit, but I knocked Ray down.

384
00:24:39,266 --> 00:24:41,626
Let me buy you guys a drink,
all right? You want a cold one?

385
00:24:41,643 --> 00:24:43,043
- No, no, no...
- A cold one!

386
00:24:43,057 --> 00:24:45,950
I've got to leave.
I've got a plane to catch. Next time.

387
00:24:45,959 --> 00:24:48,906
Hey, Ray. HBO is making
a movie on me, you know?

388
00:24:49,993 --> 00:24:51,811
Can they call you?

389
00:24:51,835 --> 00:24:53,843
I'm going to get a fight.

390
00:24:53,854 --> 00:24:56,707
I'd like you to be there, for old times' sake.
You can commentate or something.

391
00:24:56,719 --> 00:24:58,567
What's the movie about?

392
00:24:58,588 --> 00:25:00,619
My comeback, right?

393
00:25:00,643 --> 00:25:03,633
- Call me.
- I'll call you.

394
00:25:03,648 --> 00:25:06,178
Don't be a stranger.

395
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,517
He's my old pal.

396
00:25:11,901 --> 00:25:14,156
- You going to the hospital?
- What is that?

397
00:25:15,573 --> 00:25:17,968
Look, Mick. Nobody's got heart like you.

398
00:25:17,991 --> 00:25:20,787
You're a very talented fighter,
but you're not getting the right fights.

399
00:25:20,807 --> 00:25:22,546
It's killing your chances.

400
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:24,730
- What's he talking to Mike Toma about?
- I don't know what that is.

401
00:25:24,753 --> 00:25:26,584
I want to give you a real shot.

402
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,989
I want you to come with me.
I want to pay you to train with my guys.

403
00:25:30,008 --> 00:25:31,863
- Where?
- Las Vegas.

404
00:25:31,879 --> 00:25:34,862
Do it right and make one last run
at this thing before it's too late.

405
00:25:34,885 --> 00:25:36,650
What about my brother?

406
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:39,268
With all due respect,
he's too much trouble.

407
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:42,357
You owe it to yourself to come to Vegas.

408
00:25:42,369 --> 00:25:45,105
Come on, Mick. What has Dicky done for you?

409
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:48,075
He gets you into fights.
He lets you get beat like you did tonight.

410
00:25:48,087 --> 00:25:51,962
You know you never should have been in that fight.
Eighteen pounds. Think of it that way.

411
00:25:51,969 --> 00:25:53,612
You should have given it up.

412
00:25:55,373 --> 00:25:58,027
Get out of the car there. Come on, you!

413
00:25:58,039 --> 00:26:00,790
- Sit the hell down.
- Just a little more scotch for Mom, okay?

414
00:26:00,802 --> 00:26:05,033
Here you go. Nice and easy.
Don't hurt yourself coming back, old broad.

415
00:26:06,383 --> 00:26:10,062
Oh, my God, that Sugar Ray...
He's a beautiful man, isn't he? Right?

416
00:26:10,072 --> 00:26:11,634
A beautiful man.

417
00:26:11,657 --> 00:26:13,630
You should have seen the way
he was looking at her.

418
00:26:14,621 --> 00:26:17,409
- He's a pretty man, huh?
- He's a good guy. I like him. I know.

419
00:26:17,428 --> 00:26:20,774
I seen him ringside, and he was
so happy seeing me and Mick together.

420
00:26:20,792 --> 00:26:24,068
You know he's all about family, that guy.
Likes to see a family stick together.

421
00:26:24,086 --> 00:26:27,779
Mick, what'd Mike Toma want
with you last night, huh?

422
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:30,312
He wants to train me in Vegas.

423
00:26:30,329 --> 00:26:32,771
You can't trust that guy, Micky.
He ain't family, you know?

424
00:26:32,795 --> 00:26:34,180
You don't know him.

425
00:26:34,204 --> 00:26:37,426
He say anything about me?
He say I could come?

426
00:26:37,438 --> 00:26:39,234
He didn't mention you.

427
00:26:41,243 --> 00:26:44,096
What are you going to do in Vegas
without your brother, huh?

428
00:26:44,117 --> 00:26:46,348
That guy just wants to use you,
like a piece of toilet paper.

429
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:49,494
What are you going to do in Vegas
without Dicky? Without your family?

430
00:26:49,497 --> 00:26:51,798
- I know. That's what I told him.
- You told him that, right?

431
00:26:51,822 --> 00:26:54,546
Yeah, I told him. I said
I need to be with my family.

432
00:26:54,569 --> 00:26:57,180
That's right.
Nothing wrong with that.

433
00:26:57,204 --> 00:26:59,986
Sugar Ray said call him.
We're going to call him, baby.

434
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:02,476
You guys can spar a little, right?

435
00:27:04,653 --> 00:27:09,232
There's my champ.
Daddy's home. Daddy's home!

436
00:27:10,325 --> 00:27:12,227
I love you...

437
00:27:13,953 --> 00:27:15,784
Your face hurting you, sweetheart?

438
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:18,999
Because it's killing me.

439
00:27:19,723 --> 00:27:21,625
- Come on...
- Uncle Micky win the fight?

440
00:27:21,647 --> 00:27:24,208
No, Uncle Micky didn't win this time.
Not this time.

441
00:27:24,219 --> 00:27:28,141
Hey, Mick. Take care.
I'll call you tomorrow.

442
00:27:28,165 --> 00:27:30,560
Cheer up. We'll get you another fight.

443
00:27:30,569 --> 00:27:33,164
I don't know, Mom.
I don't think I want to do this no more.

444
00:27:33,187 --> 00:27:36,125
- What don't you want to do no more?
- I just don't want to do it anymore.

445
00:27:36,147 --> 00:27:38,991
- What are you talking...
- Hey, Mick.

446
00:27:39,014 --> 00:27:41,867
ESPN screwed us. They owe us.

447
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:45,081
We'll get another fight.
You heal up.

448
00:27:45,104 --> 00:27:47,476
- It'll be okay.
- Yeah, listen to your brother.

449
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,769
They owe us big-time, sweetheart.

450
00:27:49,789 --> 00:27:52,912
Hey, maybe they'll even do Dicky's
comeback fight. What do you think, huh?

451
00:27:53,934 --> 00:27:56,928
Oh, come on. Cheer up.
You take a little soap when you get home.

452
00:27:56,951 --> 00:27:59,159
Have a day or two to think about it.
I'll find you a better fight, sweetheart.

453
00:27:59,182 --> 00:28:00,967
Much better fight.
I'm going to talk to them.

454
00:28:00,987 --> 00:28:03,546
- For Christ's sake, Alice.
- What?

455
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:06,603
- He's been through the ringer. Leave him alone.
- What are you talking about?

456
00:28:06,628 --> 00:28:09,658
- Leave him some time to himself.
- What is your fucking problem?

457
00:28:10,292 --> 00:28:12,540
Where's Micky?
Is Micky not going to come in?

458
00:28:12,552 --> 00:28:16,418
No, he's not coming in.
He needs to get back and get some rest.

459
00:28:16,442 --> 00:28:17,999
Come on. Let's go inside.

460
00:28:18,008 --> 00:28:20,332
He's going to go rest.
He's all grumpy.

461
00:28:20,344 --> 00:28:23,385
He's tired. He's beat up.
He's a little embarrassed, I think.

462
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:24,021
Who is it?

463
00:29:45,655 --> 00:29:47,549
I saw the shade move.

464
00:29:48,643 --> 00:29:51,003
Micky, the shade is still moving.
I saw you come to the window.

465
00:29:51,027 --> 00:29:52,589
I know you're in there.

466
00:29:53,388 --> 00:29:55,302
The least you can do
is open up this door

467
00:29:55,325 --> 00:29:57,861
and tell me to my face
why you didn't call me yesterday.

468
00:30:03,985 --> 00:30:05,511
Why did you stand me up last night?

469
00:30:07,101 --> 00:30:10,319
I started to call.
I was going to call. I just couldn't.

470
00:30:10,331 --> 00:30:11,908
Because you lost the fight?

471
00:30:11,929 --> 00:30:14,735
Maybe, yeah.
Because I lost the fight.

472
00:30:14,747 --> 00:30:16,658
How do you know my house anyway?

473
00:30:16,674 --> 00:30:19,503
I asked my brother.

474
00:30:19,504 --> 00:30:23,448
Your thing's coming off.
And your other thing.

475
00:30:25,597 --> 00:30:27,257
You got any tape?

476
00:30:35,174 --> 00:30:37,820
Did the black Jewish guy
do this to you?

477
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:41,003
I didn't get to fight the black Jewish guy.

478
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,476
You didn't get to go head, body, head?

479
00:30:45,562 --> 00:30:47,863
Saoul Mamby got the flu.

480
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:51,069
Guy that took his place had twenty pounds
on me. I never should have fought him.

481
00:30:52,683 --> 00:30:54,422
Why did you?

482
00:30:54,445 --> 00:30:56,790
Nobody would have got paid.

483
00:30:57,754 --> 00:31:00,300
Everybody said I could beat him.

484
00:31:00,311 --> 00:31:02,765
Who's everybody?

485
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,428
My mother and my brother.

486
00:31:08,338 --> 00:31:11,271
So are you going to take me
to dinner and a movie, or what?

487
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,577
- Hey.
- Hey.

488
00:31:43,855 --> 00:31:45,862
- You look great.
- Thank you.

489
00:31:45,874 --> 00:31:47,732
You've got a nice house, too.

490
00:31:47,756 --> 00:31:49,176
It's an apartment building.

491
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,827
There's five of them in there.
One of my old roommates lives with me.

492
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,506
Roommate?
What, were you in the army?

493
00:31:53,529 --> 00:31:55,712
- College.
- College? Wow.

494
00:31:55,724 --> 00:31:58,483
Yeah, a lot of good it did me.
I work in a bar.

495
00:31:58,506 --> 00:32:01,148
You seem to enjoy it.
Very popular down there.

496
00:32:01,164 --> 00:32:04,053
Ugh, yeah. Popular.
I've got to get out of there.

497
00:32:04,076 --> 00:32:06,917
If I don't drink while I'm working
I'll fucking kill myself.

498
00:32:06,931 --> 00:32:10,040
- What college?
- URI. Full boat.

499
00:32:10,056 --> 00:32:12,320
- A full boat's a scholarship, right?
- Yeah.

500
00:32:12,332 --> 00:32:13,787
For what?

501
00:32:13,803 --> 00:32:17,259
- I was a high-jumper.
- High-jumper? You've got to be kidding me.

502
00:32:17,261 --> 00:32:20,655
Fuck you. I was good.
I was New England champ. I cleared 5'8".

503
00:32:20,667 --> 00:32:23,567
- Wow.
- Never graduated. I partied too hard.

504
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,929
You?

505
00:32:40,513 --> 00:32:42,404
What are we doing in richie-rich Lexington?

506
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:43,965
You come to this theater a lot?

507
00:32:43,981 --> 00:32:46,024
Yeah, it's a good theater.
They've got good movies here.

508
00:32:46,036 --> 00:32:49,101
- Yeah? Like what?
- <i>Belly Epi-cue</i>.

509
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:51,175
I think it's <i>Bell Epic</i>.

510
00:32:51,199 --> 00:32:52,918
It's epic. <i>Bell Epic</i>.

511
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:56,336
<i>Belle Epoque</i>.
<i>The New York Times</i> don't lie.

512
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,278
Well I never heard of it.

513
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,484
Where'd you hear about it?
<i>The New York Times</i>?

514
00:33:00,508 --> 00:33:02,480
No, a guy from work.

515
00:33:02,492 --> 00:33:04,829
And the cinematography
is supposed to be gorgeous.

516
00:33:04,841 --> 00:33:05,874
Oh. Cool.

517
00:33:33,582 --> 00:33:36,588
That's the movie you wanted to see?

518
00:33:36,611 --> 00:33:38,820
There wasn't even any good sex in it.

519
00:33:38,843 --> 00:33:42,029
Had to read the whole fucking movie.
Fucking subtitled.

520
00:33:43,494 --> 00:33:47,096
Some guy from a road crew recommended it
to you? A fucking subtitled movie?

521
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:50,767
What's going on, huh?

522
00:33:50,781 --> 00:33:54,216
What's going on? You got a girlfriend
or something? You hiding me from her?

523
00:33:54,227 --> 00:33:55,833
I don't have a girlfriend, all right?

524
00:33:57,189 --> 00:33:59,643
I like you.

525
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:02,908
I came here because
I don't want to show my face in Lowell.

526
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:05,350
I told everybody I was going to win
that fight and get back on track.

527
00:34:05,355 --> 00:34:08,079
I told my daughter I was going to get
a bigger apartment so she could move in.

528
00:34:08,091 --> 00:34:10,052
You don't think I wanted to call you?

529
00:34:10,063 --> 00:34:12,318
I was embarrassed.

530
00:34:12,337 --> 00:34:14,716
I'm sick of being a fucking disappointment.

531
00:34:19,729 --> 00:34:22,823
You really think your family
is looking out for you?

532
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,467
Don't say that. I don't like that.

533
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:30,261
What else I can say
after what you told me?

534
00:34:32,107 --> 00:34:34,006
Look at your face.

535
00:34:35,192 --> 00:34:37,105
Look at you.

536
00:35:00,919 --> 00:35:02,738
Bullshit, Lou.

537
00:35:02,739 --> 00:35:07,366
I'm not going to stop calling until you
make this right and get us a fight that's fair.

538
00:35:07,389 --> 00:35:09,939
My boy could have got killed last time.

539
00:35:12,155 --> 00:35:14,034
Yeah, like what?

540
00:35:14,969 --> 00:35:17,834
Just don't tell me he just got
off the fucking couch.

541
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,307
Mm-hm.

542
00:35:22,643 --> 00:35:24,220
Coming off a loss?

543
00:35:25,247 --> 00:35:28,265
That sounds very interesting.
I'll get back to you.

544
00:35:28,277 --> 00:35:31,271
Got a great opportunity here.

545
00:35:31,283 --> 00:35:32,887
We've got to go find Micky.

546
00:35:32,899 --> 00:35:34,893
Nobody's seen him for, like, three weeks.

547
00:35:36,684 --> 00:35:38,164
Jesus...

548
00:35:39,146 --> 00:35:41,701
Used to be Dicky we couldn't find.
Now it's both of them?

549
00:35:41,702 --> 00:35:43,921
Mom, I think he's with that girl from the bar.

550
00:35:43,929 --> 00:35:47,097
- What girl?
- It's that fucking girl, Charlene.

551
00:35:47,121 --> 00:35:49,375
That's who he's with. That girl from the bar.

552
00:35:49,387 --> 00:35:53,091
George was all fucking eager
for them to get together.

553
00:35:53,115 --> 00:35:55,651
- I heard she's into three-ways.
- Yeah, with other girls.

554
00:35:55,674 --> 00:35:57,697
Yeah, like one of those MTV girls.

555
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,963
MTV girls? What are you talking about?

556
00:35:59,975 --> 00:36:01,073
Wild.

557
00:36:01,084 --> 00:36:04,008
She acts all fucking superior
because she went to college.

558
00:36:05,334 --> 00:36:08,152
You girls just go find your brother Micky.

559
00:36:08,175 --> 00:36:11,593
Tell him I've got important business to discuss.

560
00:36:11,617 --> 00:36:13,539
I've got to go find Dicky.

561
00:36:22,735 --> 00:36:24,547
Dicky!

562
00:37:12,956 --> 00:37:16,044
Hey, Mom. It's not...
It's just...

563
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:19,268
It's just a friend's house.

564
00:37:21,243 --> 00:37:22,678

00:38:48,471 --> 00:38:50,010
Red beard.

579
00:38:50,033 --> 00:38:52,569
She's Red Dog, and that's Beaver.

580
00:38:52,575 --> 00:38:55,128
You're Red Dog.
You're Beaver.

581
00:38:55,151 --> 00:38:57,781
- Yeah, don't use those names.
- It's just for family.

582
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,237
Be nice.

583
00:38:59,824 --> 00:39:01,797
Don't use the nicknames.

584
00:39:03,034 --> 00:39:05,270
What the fuck will I call them then?

585
00:39:06,054 --> 00:39:07,710
Speaking of family...

586
00:39:20,469 --> 00:39:21,726
Hello.

587
00:39:23,238 --> 00:39:25,567
- Alice, this is Charlene.
- Hi.

588
00:39:27,735 --> 00:39:29,895
I've heard a lot about you.

589
00:39:29,905 --> 00:39:31,631
Really? I've heard a lot about you, too.

590
00:39:31,654 --> 00:39:33,693
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Same thing you meant.

591
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,671
Can we just sit down and talk about business?

592
00:39:36,549 --> 00:39:40,878
I got you another fight, Mick.
Just like I said I would.

593
00:39:41,868 --> 00:39:45,302
- Lou Gold and ESPN made it right.
- Just like I told you.

594
00:39:45,326 --> 00:39:49,553
Joe Mellenk. Six weeks. Foxwoods.

595
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:53,312
Ten in eight. He's nothing.

596
00:39:53,335 --> 00:39:56,188
- And they're going to pay us twenty grand.
- $17,500, technically.

597
00:39:56,205 --> 00:40:00,596
$17,500, which is still good money, Mick.

598
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,501
Yeah.

599
00:40:04,844 --> 00:40:08,504
That's good, Dick. I'm just trying to
figure out what's best for me.

600
00:40:12,263 --> 00:40:14,206
Like what, huh?

601
00:40:18,127 --> 00:40:21,038
What's best for you, sweetheart?

602
00:40:21,062 --> 00:40:23,869
Come on, Mick. I thought you'd be more excited.
Why aren't you more excited?

603
00:40:23,893 --> 00:40:27,791
It's a good fight, good money.
I got something with Lou Gold.

604
00:40:27,815 --> 00:40:29,601
He knows us.

605
00:40:30,541 --> 00:40:33,969
I know, Mom. I just don't want things
going the way they've been going.

606
00:40:33,981 --> 00:40:38,018
Mick, that last fight was unfair.
It was unfair.

607
00:40:38,031 --> 00:40:40,908
- And we ain't going to repeat that, right?
- Oh, not on your life.

608
00:40:42,665 --> 00:40:45,166
You know, buddy,
it's just you in the ring.

609
00:40:45,178 --> 00:40:46,763
Yeah, I know it's just me in the ring.

610
00:40:46,775 --> 00:40:48,924
But I don't like the way
things have been going here.

611
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,020
- Where?
- Where?

612
00:40:50,044 --> 00:40:53,026
Here, this, us, Lowell, the whole routine.

613
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:55,866
- George, stay out of it!
- You're doing all the talking.

614
00:40:55,891 --> 00:40:58,861
- Let him talk. Listen.
- I'm asking him.

615
00:40:58,879 --> 00:41:01,931
- You're telling him. Listen.
- Stay out of it.

616
00:41:01,943 --> 00:41:04,127
Hey, don't tell me to stay out of it.

617
00:41:04,139 --> 00:41:06,358
Mick, what's the problem?

618
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:10,153
- Problems.
- What problems?

619
00:41:10,178 --> 00:41:12,688
- Problems...
- Like what?

620
00:41:13,909 --> 00:41:17,775
Like maybe you
not showing up on time to train.

621
00:41:17,794 --> 00:41:21,105
Like maybe him having to
come find you in a crack house

622
00:41:21,122 --> 00:41:24,282
when you're supposed to be at the airport.

623
00:41:26,287 --> 00:41:30,482
I'm sorry. I don't know who you are.
Why are you talking?

624
00:41:30,494 --> 00:41:33,594
I'm Charlene. We just met.

625
00:41:33,617 --> 00:41:36,984
We're together. Do we need to do this again?
Hi, I'm Charlene.

626
00:41:37,007 --> 00:41:39,828
- Hi, Charlene.
- Hi.

627
00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:41,696
- Hi, I'm Charlene.
- Hi, Charlene.

628
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:43,293
Hey, we're together.

629
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:46,211
What are you going to do, Mick?

630
00:41:46,235 --> 00:41:48,771
Listen to some MTV girl who works in a bar?

631
00:41:48,786 --> 00:41:50,759
What does she know about boxing?

632
00:41:50,778 --> 00:41:56,002
I know they're going to Vegas
and getting paid to train year-round.

633
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:58,769
Sounds a hell of a lot better than
what you've got him doing here.

634
00:42:02,098 --> 00:42:04,526
You going to let her talk like that
to your mother?

635
00:42:04,545 --> 00:42:05,895
Come on, Micky.

636
00:42:05,912 --> 00:42:08,957
I told you, we're together.
This is my girlfriend. I want her here.

637
00:42:10,479 --> 00:42:14,526
I have done everything.
Everything I could for you, Micky.

638
00:42:15,858 --> 00:42:17,795
This MTV girl comes along...

639
00:42:17,819 --> 00:42:20,880
Stop calling me an MTV girl,
whatever the fuck that means.

640
00:42:20,903 --> 00:42:22,767
- Skank.
- Wild.

641
00:42:24,488 --> 00:42:29,067
I've been doing this over fifteen years.
She comes in, disrespects me...

642
00:42:29,091 --> 00:42:32,100
She don't mean no disrespect, okay?

643
00:42:32,112 --> 00:42:35,168
I had a chance to get paid to train year-round.

644
00:42:35,191 --> 00:42:37,816
Year-round, okay?
That's all she's talking about.

645
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:39,894
I would hope that you guys
could appreciate that.

646
00:42:39,906 --> 00:42:42,641
I know what you're talking about, all right?
I could have had that.

647
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:49,227
You know, I had opportunities
like maybe you're going to have.

648
00:42:49,736 --> 00:42:54,941
Now, you want money
so you can train year-round? Yeah?

649
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,636
I'll get you money
so you can train year-round.

650
00:42:57,647 --> 00:42:58,806
- You?
- Yeah, I'll do it.

651
00:42:58,817 --> 00:42:59,662
- Trust me.
- How?

652
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:02,180
Hey, trust me, all right?

653
00:43:02,199 --> 00:43:03,382
Done.

654
00:43:05,462 --> 00:43:08,644
All right? Charlene?
Yeah? Everyone?

655
00:43:14,403 --> 00:43:17,491
So you put in $200...

656
00:43:17,515 --> 00:43:19,558
Then you get ten other people
to put in $200...

657
00:43:21,448 --> 00:43:24,671
And you've got your $2000.

658
00:43:29,535 --> 00:43:33,192
- Everybody give you $200?
- No, not everybody. Just ten of you.

659
00:43:33,203 --> 00:43:34,507
Ten lucky ones.

660
00:43:38,632 --> 00:43:40,217
- You'll rip us off.
- No, no.

661
00:43:40,235 --> 00:43:42,865
- Give me another $200.
- You give me $200!

662
00:43:43,898 --> 00:43:47,631
No, you get that from ten other people
who you offer the opportunity to.

663
00:43:47,632 --> 00:43:50,109
Right? You understand? No?

664
00:43:54,794 --> 00:43:58,566
He thinks you think
Cambodian people are stupid.

665
00:43:58,589 --> 00:44:00,374
I love Cambodian people!

666
00:44:00,386 --> 00:44:03,759
I mean, look. Look at Karen.

667
00:44:03,783 --> 00:44:06,137
She's my girlfriend.
She's beautiful. I love her.

668
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,565
And Brian. We work on a road crew together.

669
00:44:09,583 --> 00:44:10,769
Not so much lately.

670
00:44:10,783 --> 00:44:12,884
Brian, we work on a road crew together.

671
00:44:12,908 --> 00:44:15,444
You haven't been showing up,
that's what I'm saying.

672
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:18,077
This isn't any kind of Cambodian thing.

673
00:44:18,078 --> 00:44:20,333
White people do this to other white people.

674
00:44:20,344 --> 00:44:22,693
- It's what makes the world go around.
- I don't think that's helping.

675
00:44:22,716 --> 00:44:26,602
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity...

676
00:44:31,523 --> 00:44:36,314
I mean, they didn't understand.
They're practically on my game...

677
00:44:36,325 --> 00:44:39,754
Usually they listen to what I say,
but they just didn't understand

678
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:43,494
the opportunity. I mean, it was awesome.
What were we talking about?

679
00:44:43,503 --> 00:44:45,593
- Before you fought Sugar Ray.
- Right, right, right.

680
00:44:45,605 --> 00:44:50,560
Sugar Ray was too much, too soon.
I needed to build up slow.

681
00:44:52,145 --> 00:44:56,540
- What's this movie about again?
- I told you, it's about crack addiction.

682
00:44:56,563 --> 00:44:59,405
Showing what it really is
so kids can see it for real.

683
00:45:02,785 --> 00:45:04,652
Fuck.

684
00:45:06,824 --> 00:45:09,055
We've got to get Mick's money.

685
00:45:21,439 --> 00:45:23,599
Yeah!
That was awesome!

686
00:46:08,854 --> 00:46:11,896
- Get out of the car!
- Oh, shit!

687
00:46:13,728 --> 00:46:17,097
Put your hands on the roof!
Put your hands on the roof, that's it!

688
00:46:17,098 --> 00:46:18,789
- Empty your pockets.
- Are you a cop?

689
00:46:18,813 --> 00:46:22,041
Get on the fucking sidewalk, move!
Fucking move! Don't turn around!

690
00:46:22,059 --> 00:46:25,346
Don't turn around!
We'll have to take your vehicle.

691
00:46:25,369 --> 00:46:27,717
- How am I going to get home?
- That's your problem.

692
00:46:29,222 --> 00:46:31,371
How much we got here? Count it.

693
00:46:35,134 --> 00:46:36,865
What the fuck?

694
00:46:36,866 --> 00:46:39,496
That's the guy!
He did it to me and he's doing it again!

695
00:46:39,513 --> 00:46:41,602
Get on the ground right now!

696
00:47:18,521 --> 00:47:21,668
Open the door!
I've got to get off the fucking street!

697
00:47:23,601 --> 00:47:25,771
I'm trying to get off the fucking street!

698
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:49,298
It's Dicky. The cops are fucking punching him.
They're beating him. He needs help.

699
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:53,906
Stay here. Don't get up. Stay here.

700
00:47:53,914 --> 00:47:56,756
Listen to him. Stay right here.

701
00:47:56,767 --> 00:47:59,475
Are you fucking kidding me?

702
00:48:07,133 --> 00:48:08,284
Hey what the fuck?
Come on.

703
00:48:08,301 --> 00:48:10,452
Just put him in the car.
You don't need to do that.

704
00:48:13,329 --> 00:48:15,687
Want to get involved?
Now you're involved.

705
00:48:20,104 --> 00:48:22,041
He's a fighter.
Break his fucking hands

706
00:48:37,326 --> 00:48:41,012
Micky your hand...
Your hand...

707
00:48:45,462 --> 00:48:47,651
Separate cars, separate cells.

708
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:50,098
I don't want them making up
some bullshit defense story.

709
00:48:50,123 --> 00:48:52,776
Come on, folks, time to go home.
Let's go.

710
00:48:55,102 --> 00:48:57,051
- Hey, Dicky!
- What the fuck, man?

711
00:48:57,062 --> 00:48:59,493
- Dicky!
- Jesus Christ.

712
00:49:01,779 --> 00:49:03,610
His hands...

713
00:49:31,174 --> 00:49:34,908
Welcome back, Dicky.
That's 27 arrests.

714
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:48,152
Ward: One count of disturbing the peace,
released on your own recognizance.

715
00:49:48,176 --> 00:49:52,057
Eklund: Three counts of assault
and battery on a police officer,

716
00:49:52,077 --> 00:49:55,998
two counts of resisting arrest,
two counts of larceny from a person,

717
00:49:56,022 --> 00:49:58,429
two counts of impersonating
a police officer.

718
00:49:58,446 --> 00:50:01,558
Bail set at $25,000.

719
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:04,338
Case continued two weeks from today.

720
00:50:06,012 --> 00:50:10,127
I'm wondering about the File 357.

721
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:13,215
I need a copy of the discovery report,
as well.

722
00:50:17,392 --> 00:50:20,326
- You're going to say it was self-defense, right?
- What?

723
00:50:20,327 --> 00:50:22,489
You're going to say it was self-defense, right?

724
00:50:22,511 --> 00:50:24,793
You came outside, you seen them beating on me.
I didn't do nothing.

725
00:50:24,805 --> 00:50:27,727
I was just waiting outside like anybody else.
Mick, I was doing it for you.

726
00:50:27,729 --> 00:50:29,243
- You did it for me?
- Yes.

727
00:50:29,267 --> 00:50:32,273
Do me a favor. Don't do fucking
nothing for me no more, okay?

728
00:50:32,286 --> 00:50:35,984
- I'm fucking done lying for you.
- What are you going to do without me, huh?

729
00:50:35,996 --> 00:50:39,436
Huh?
This ain't how it was going to go down.

730
00:50:39,454 --> 00:50:42,683
They should have just put me in the car, huh?

731
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:45,431
Mick, come on! Mick!

732
00:50:58,531 --> 00:51:01,067
Dicky, hey! What's up, Dicky?

733
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:05,376
Hey, that's the man!

734
00:51:05,388 --> 00:51:07,472
- Hey!
- Hey!

735
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:10,935
Hey, you knocked out Sugar Ray!

736
00:51:10,947 --> 00:51:13,870
Dicky! Dicky! Dicky!

737
00:51:56,552 --> 00:51:57,314
Who is it?

738
00:52:04,088 --> 00:52:06,480
I don't want to see you, Micky.

739
00:52:06,495 --> 00:52:07,901
Charlene...

740
00:52:07,913 --> 00:52:09,848
I can't take it.

741
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,748
I'm not going to let you
or your family drag me down.

742
00:52:12,772 --> 00:52:14,764
I'm quitting, Charlene, okay?

743
00:52:14,787 --> 00:52:17,675
I'm done fighting.
I don't need it anymore.

744
00:52:18,307 --> 00:52:21,191
- That's fucking stupid.
- What? Why?

745
00:52:21,894 --> 00:52:25,836
Because it's sad that you let them take it
away from you with their stupid bullshit.

746
00:52:27,681 --> 00:52:29,654
What else I can do, Charlene?

747
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:32,394
There's a lot you can do, Micky.

748
00:52:32,418 --> 00:52:36,522
There's this guy that your dad wants you to meet,
you just don't think you can do it without Dicky.

749
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,518
Charlene...

750
00:52:39,692 --> 00:52:42,041
- Don't call.
- Come on.

751
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,225
Don't call me, okay?

752
00:52:54,047 --> 00:52:56,336
Hey, Dicky, you hurt bad?

753
00:52:58,344 --> 00:53:00,528
Poor fucker.

754
00:53:34,638 --> 00:53:36,763
Hey, Micky, bring another bucket, huh?

755
00:53:39,316 --> 00:53:40,209
Good.

756
00:53:51,041 --> 00:53:53,988
And this Friday,
an HBO original documentary.

757
00:53:54,011 --> 00:53:57,169
Right here in Lowell, Mass.,
the story of Dick Eklund,

758
00:53:57,181 --> 00:53:59,893
the once promising boxer who turned criminal.

759
00:54:14,103 --> 00:54:16,414
Oh, look who it is.

760
00:54:19,128 --> 00:54:20,490
That's...
That's Dicky's brother.

761
00:54:20,514 --> 00:54:22,592
- Hey, Micky.
- Regular.

762
00:54:24,947 --> 00:54:26,027
Hey.

763
00:54:27,836 --> 00:54:29,855
- Hey, what's up, man?
- Look who's here.

764
00:54:32,391 --> 00:54:34,769
- Good to see you, bro.
- How you doing?

765
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:37,552
How you feeling?
How's the hand?

766
00:54:37,576 --> 00:54:40,769
- Uh, it's getting there.
- Looks better.

767
00:54:40,781 --> 00:54:43,971
Why don't you come down to the gym?
We'll work out, if you want.

768
00:54:43,983 --> 00:54:47,942
- You fat fuck, you're getting big.
- Yeah, I know. It's just...

769
00:54:47,965 --> 00:54:50,466
Roofing for my father and
spending more time with Kasie.

770
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:52,627
By the way, this movie on HBO, man.

771
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:55,057
What are you boys looking at?

772
00:54:55,068 --> 00:54:57,477
The movie's not about him.
It's about his crazy brother.

773
00:54:57,493 --> 00:54:58,749
I should go.

774
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:02,443
- Come back to the gym, Mick.
- Bye, Mick.

775
00:55:02,454 --> 00:55:05,364
Don't go watch that crazy shit on TV.
Don't.

776
00:55:17,852 --> 00:55:19,551
Going to Hollywood...

777
00:55:36,425 --> 00:55:39,573
Let's get this started!

778
00:55:51,415 --> 00:55:54,726
Lowell was the birthplace of
the Industrial Revolution in America.

779
00:55:54,749 --> 00:55:59,401
- Oh, that's...
- These people came to find...

780
00:55:59,425 --> 00:56:02,701
I used to live over there.
This town's got good memories, right?

781
00:56:02,713 --> 00:56:04,392
- Check it out.
- Fuck yeah.

782
00:56:04,409 --> 00:56:06,617
This house right up this way,
the white house...

783
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:10,418
- Oh, yeah!
- First time I got my crack over here.

784
00:56:10,442 --> 00:56:12,755
Did you ever know they
smoke crack at the white house?

785
00:56:16,357 --> 00:56:18,929
The first time I did crack or whatever,
I was about twenty-three.

786
00:56:18,946 --> 00:56:22,304
A friend of mine gave me a gram or whatever.
Fuck I wish that never happened.

787
00:56:22,328 --> 00:56:26,350
Before that,
I'd be doing the silver mittens and stuff.

788
00:56:26,361 --> 00:56:30,248
I was the only kid.
I'd be twelve. I'm shit-faced.

789
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:31,751
I'll tell you how crack was.

790
00:56:33,735 --> 00:56:38,032
It enters your lungs.
When it enters your lungs,

791
00:56:38,056 --> 00:56:40,880
- I want to watch Daddy.
- Oh, my God.

792
00:56:40,904 --> 00:56:45,088
- No, sweetie. You go back upstairs.
- But I want to watch Daddy on TV.

793
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:48,468
No, you can't.
You can't watch Daddy now, all right?

794
00:56:48,469 --> 00:56:50,876
You go back upstairs and go to bed, okay?

795
00:56:50,893 --> 00:56:53,312
Okay, this is my boy, here. Check it out.

796
00:56:53,324 --> 00:56:55,358
What... What can I sell you today?
A python?

797
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:58,846
Yeah, check it out, man.
They're going to buy me some.

798
00:57:01,745 --> 00:57:05,855
It's been a while.
I'll take anything right now.

799
00:57:05,866 --> 00:57:11,319
Never thought I'd kiss a fucking snake.
I always dreamed about it, but...

800
00:57:11,331 --> 00:57:15,133
You do a lot of shit when you're high, right?

801
00:57:16,565 --> 00:57:19,559
Heck, yeah.
Put it all on the map.

802
00:57:19,571 --> 00:57:22,754
You knocked Sugar Ray Leonard down,
didn't you say?

803
00:57:22,778 --> 00:57:26,836
Yeah, he knocked him down,
but I don't think it was a knockout.

804
00:57:26,848 --> 00:57:29,630
- I think he slipped.
- He knocked him down.

805
00:57:29,642 --> 00:57:32,150
- He didn't slip.
- He slipped.

806
00:57:32,162 --> 00:57:34,779
- Oh, Jack...
- Come on.

807
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:36,295
That's a fucking lie!

808
00:57:36,312 --> 00:57:38,367
They say he's in trouble with drugs...

809
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:41,047
What are you doing?
Are you talking shit about the family?

810
00:57:41,059 --> 00:57:43,090
- No, not at all.
- Yeah. I heard you say.

811
00:57:43,114 --> 00:57:46,495
We're not like that.
This is not what Lowell is all about.

812
00:57:46,507 --> 00:57:49,912
I thought he could make a comeback
and make us proud, but he didn't.

813
00:57:49,923 --> 00:57:52,941
- I don't know what Dicky was thinking.
- Very disappointing.

814
00:57:52,953 --> 00:57:56,939
You brought the city of Lowell
back thirty years. We're not happy.

815
00:57:56,951 --> 00:57:58,665
- Hello?
- Jimmy.

816
00:57:58,689 --> 00:58:01,483
Hey, will you do me a favor?
Make sure Kasie's not watching HBO?

817
00:58:01,495 --> 00:58:03,286
Actually, we were watching it right now, Mick,

818
00:58:03,287 --> 00:58:06,163
but don't worry about it.
I got it...

819
00:58:06,186 --> 00:58:07,901
I want her to see it.

820
00:58:07,912 --> 00:58:09,404
Let her see who her uncle is.

821
00:58:09,427 --> 00:58:10,918
- What?
- Who you are.

822
00:58:10,942 --> 00:58:13,195
Who I am?
What are you talking about?

823
00:58:13,218 --> 00:58:16,529
- Kids need to know the truth, Mick.
- Laurie, turn it off, please.

824
00:58:16,541 --> 00:58:20,004
She does not need to see this.
She doesn't need to see it. She's a kid.

825
00:58:21,072 --> 00:58:23,659
If you're on crack,

826
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:27,288
you feel so much lighter.

827
00:58:27,312 --> 00:58:30,494
You know, you feel young.
And everything is so funny.

828
00:58:30,506 --> 00:58:36,827
Everything is just...
Everything is...

829
00:58:36,851 --> 00:58:38,150
It wasn't funny.

830
00:58:42,847 --> 00:58:45,854
And then it fades,
then you've got to get high again.

831
00:58:50,904 --> 00:58:54,941
Your part of the movie's going to end
with you going to jail.

832
00:58:57,630 --> 00:59:00,190
We know Dicky.
We're going to take care of him, huh?

833
00:59:03,348 --> 00:59:04,910
You guys can't talk to him.

834
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:11,880
Turn that shit off.
Turn this off, all right?

835
00:59:11,892 --> 00:59:14,098
Turn it off.
Will you turn this off?

836
00:59:14,099 --> 00:59:16,236
I'm turning it fucking off.

837
00:59:20,646 --> 00:59:23,640
Hey, that's my life.
That's my fucking life up there.

838
00:59:23,651 --> 00:59:26,481
- I want to watch this.
- I don't care. I will fuck you up.

839
00:59:26,493 --> 00:59:29,917
You fucking want some?
Don't fucking try me.

840
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:33,111
I still fucking won it, okay?
You fucking want some?

841
00:59:33,974 --> 00:59:36,639
That's my son there.
You're laughing at him?

842
00:59:38,306 --> 00:59:43,241
That's my son, he's crying, he needs me,
and I'm fucking stuck in here?

843
00:59:46,406 --> 00:59:49,036
Micky, are you watching this?

844
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:51,049
What are they doing to us?

845
00:59:52,914 --> 00:59:56,026
I don't know what to tell you.

846
00:59:56,049 --> 00:59:59,692
You're pretending like you don't know what's going on.
He's been doing this for years.

847
01:00:00,991 --> 01:00:03,285
Yeah, I know it's horrible, Mom.

848
01:00:08,254 --> 01:00:09,780
What do you think?

849
01:00:09,802 --> 01:00:13,090
- You think they set him up?
- Mom, what do you think he was doing?

850
01:00:13,102 --> 01:00:16,577
You know, they gave him money,
gave him drugs for the movie, right?

851
01:00:20,019 --> 01:00:21,217
Micky?

852
01:02:42,164 --> 01:02:44,313
- You got a new bag, huh?
- Yup.

853
01:02:44,336 --> 01:02:46,884
- New bracket, too?
- Yup.

854
01:02:46,905 --> 01:02:48,338
- What happened to the peanut?
- Don't know.

855
01:02:50,228 --> 01:02:51,863
Like a beach ball.

856
01:04:17,604 --> 01:04:18,931
Good job.

857
01:04:20,116 --> 01:04:23,257
- Mick, Sal Lanano.
- Hey, Mick. How you doing?

858
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:26,641
- You own the cab company. Good businessman, right?
- He's very organized.

859
01:04:26,653 --> 01:04:29,048
- How's the hand?
- It's good, you know?

860
01:04:29,071 --> 01:04:31,337
It's getting better. Stronger.

861
01:04:31,362 --> 01:04:34,967
You know, I made a few calls already.
I just talked to Buddy Tags.

862
01:04:34,979 --> 01:04:39,626
He said he can set up something local.
You know, something to start back with.

863
01:04:39,637 --> 01:04:42,303
- Get your confidence back.
- That's it. You've got to get your confidence back.

864
01:04:42,326 --> 01:04:43,982
That's all.

865
01:04:45,297 --> 01:04:47,876
Your dad wants Sal to manage you,

866
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:49,849
and he wants me to train you,

867
01:04:49,872 --> 01:04:52,502
but he'll only do it on one condition.

868
01:04:54,569 --> 01:04:58,452
- No crazy time nonsense.
- That's how it's got to be.

869
01:04:58,463 --> 01:05:02,365
- No Dicky, no Alice.
- No Dicky, no Alice.

870
01:05:02,376 --> 01:05:06,040
I get it. I get it. I'm good. I understand.
Look, I appreciate the opportunity.

871
01:05:06,064 --> 01:05:08,990
Can't take the bullshit, Mick.
No offense, George.

872
01:05:08,996 --> 01:05:13,513
None taken. I mean, I'm going to be
the one that gets his balls cut off anyway.

873
01:05:14,727 --> 01:05:16,630
Yeah, you laugh.

874
01:05:16,641 --> 01:05:19,917
- You traitor!
- What are you doing?

875
01:05:21,214 --> 01:05:23,433
What the hell's the matter with you?

876
01:05:25,378 --> 01:05:27,187
Did that hurt? I hope it hurt!

877
01:05:27,209 --> 01:05:29,976
- Sal Lanano is a good man!
- A good man?

878
01:05:29,988 --> 01:05:33,205
- He's a legitimate businessman!
- Legitimate businessman?

879
01:05:33,219 --> 01:05:35,967
- What?
- Oh, my God, you know what that sounds like?

880
01:05:35,978 --> 01:05:38,632
- He's a crook, George!
- He owns a taxicab company!

881
01:05:38,655 --> 01:05:40,968
- He's organized!
- Oh, my God, he's a cab driver.

882
01:05:40,985 --> 01:05:43,298
- He knows everything about boxing, right?
- Yes.

883
01:05:43,310 --> 01:05:47,302
I don't think so! I think he's going to
steal your son's money and rob him blind!

884
01:05:47,326 --> 01:05:50,085
Why would you think that?
Why would you even think that?

885
01:05:50,102 --> 01:05:52,692
- Why can't you trust anybody?
- I know people.

886
01:05:52,716 --> 01:05:55,324
I know, George. You think I don't
know anything. But I know people.

887
01:05:55,338 --> 01:05:59,354
- I know you know things...
- And that Sal Lanana banana fucking thing...

888
01:05:59,378 --> 01:06:03,076
- We don't need that in our lives!
- We haven't made one dollar with these kids.

889
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:05,987
- You betrayed me. You betrayed me.
- Oh, bullshit, I betrayed you.

890
01:06:05,999 --> 01:06:08,312
- You're always have to say...
- He's a fucking crook!

891
01:06:08,328 --> 01:06:11,252
What's Micky supposed to do?
Dicky's in jail.

892
01:06:11,275 --> 01:06:17,197
We're not talking about his trainer, sweetheart.
We're talking about his manager, that's me!

893
01:06:17,219 --> 01:06:19,639
Yeah, but Mom, maybe Micky should
try something different...

894
01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:21,787
What are you doing,
opening your mouth in my kitchen?

895
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:24,147
You owe me $200.

896
01:06:24,170 --> 01:06:25,821
I said I was going to pay you next week.

897
01:06:25,845 --> 01:06:29,449
I don't want another word out of you.
That was last month you told me two weeks.

898
01:06:29,469 --> 01:06:32,745
Do you take sides against me in my own house?
You owe me money?

899
01:06:32,761 --> 01:06:34,651
Mom's been great to Micky, Sherri.

900
01:06:34,663 --> 01:06:37,716
Really, who's going to look after Micky
better than his own mother?

901
01:06:37,732 --> 01:06:41,090
It's that fucking girl, Charlene.
We've got to get rid of her, Mom.

902
01:06:41,114 --> 01:06:43,744
We've got to get rid of her.
It's that girl, Charlene. She's got to go.

903
01:06:43,767 --> 01:06:47,319
You're going to get Charlene involved in this?
Is that what you're all telling me?

904
01:06:47,332 --> 01:06:48,952
- Huh?
- I know where she lives.

905
01:06:48,964 --> 01:06:50,467
What are you picking on her for?

906
01:06:50,484 --> 01:06:53,466
- She lives in that yellow house on Steven Street.
- Yeah, the puke yellow.

907
01:06:53,478 --> 01:06:56,272
I'm going to talk to Micky.
Sort this out for myself.

908
01:06:56,296 --> 01:07:02,836
Yeah, sure. You go handle it with
your vigilantes. This is wrong, Alice!

909
01:07:10,008 --> 01:07:12,825
- I got it.
- Get out of my way!

910
01:07:16,971 --> 01:07:18,598
Get in the car.

911
01:07:41,178 --> 01:07:42,677
Micky, are you in there?

912
01:07:42,681 --> 01:07:44,492
Up in there on the second floor.

913
01:07:44,501 --> 01:07:45,630
Micky!

914
01:07:46,577 --> 01:07:48,632
Where the hell are you, huh?

915
01:07:48,656 --> 01:07:50,616
Are you up there? Come on down.

916
01:07:50,628 --> 01:07:52,601
Where are you?

917
01:07:53,399 --> 01:07:56,097
Holy shit, Micky.
Your mother and your sisters are here.

918
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:59,349
No, no.
Do not go out there, please.

919
01:07:59,354 --> 01:08:02,572
No, I'm not hiding
from your crazy fucking family.

920
01:08:14,642 --> 01:08:15,554
Hi.

921
01:08:15,558 --> 01:08:17,777
Well, well, well. Look at this.

922
01:08:17,789 --> 01:08:19,123
Look at what?

923
01:08:20,029 --> 01:08:22,401
Why are you hiding from us, Micky?

924
01:08:22,425 --> 01:08:24,189
- He's not hiding.
- I wasn't talking to you.

925
01:08:24,212 --> 01:08:25,973
I was talking to my son.

926
01:08:25,988 --> 01:08:30,038
- What are you doing next to her?
- I'm right here. I ain't hiding from nobody, Alice.

927
01:08:30,059 --> 01:08:33,652
Well you're not helping yourself with
your father's scumbag friend, Lanano.

928
01:08:33,674 --> 01:08:36,539
What are you going to do?
Turn your back on Dicky next, huh?

929
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:40,818
All we ever wanted for you
was to be world champion.

930
01:08:40,842 --> 01:08:43,648
Micky's a grown man.
He can think for himself.

931
01:08:43,671 --> 01:08:46,067
- Shut your mouth.
- Skank!

932
01:08:46,086 --> 01:08:49,738
Don't call me skank. I'll rip that
nasty hair right out of your fucking head.

933
01:08:49,748 --> 01:08:53,353
- I'm his mother and his manager.
- You're not my manager anymore.

934
01:08:53,365 --> 01:08:56,919
And I'm not waiting for Dicky, okay?
I'm not getting any younger.

935
01:08:56,931 --> 01:08:59,843
- Who's going to look after you, sweetheart?
- How about me?

936
01:08:59,866 --> 01:09:02,382
I know you don't understand it
but I had nine kids,

937
01:09:02,406 --> 01:09:04,366
and I love every one of you the same.

938
01:09:04,382 --> 01:09:06,449
You've got a funny way of showing it,
letting him get beat up,

939
01:09:06,473 --> 01:09:09,607
- letting him get his hand broken.
- You're crazy.

940
01:09:09,995 --> 01:09:12,651
What did I just say to you?

941
01:09:18,859 --> 01:09:19,791
Let go!

942
01:09:27,401 --> 01:09:28,299
Fuck!

943
01:09:29,437 --> 01:09:31,302
Get the fuck out of here! Now!

944
01:09:32,039 --> 01:09:33,591
Fuck you, Charlene!

945
01:09:33,603 --> 01:09:35,666
- Skank!
- I want them the fuck out of here.

946
01:09:36,043 --> 01:09:39,436
- You're fucking dead.
- Fucking bitch!

947
01:09:40,146 --> 01:09:43,280
Gail! Oh, my God.
What did she do to your nose?

948
01:09:44,652 --> 01:09:46,677
Let's get the hell out of here.

949
01:09:51,928 --> 01:09:55,345
What's happening to everybody?
I don't understand, sweetheart.

950
01:10:42,310 --> 01:10:46,104
Why do you think I spell my name with an "E"?
Because I don't.

951
01:10:46,116 --> 01:10:48,911
- "No E" Micky Ward.
- Hey, somebody push that.

952
01:10:50,252 --> 01:10:52,988
- Where are we going?
- To the ring. The ring's across the street.

953
01:10:53,012 --> 01:10:55,125
- The ring's across the street?
- Yeah.

954
01:10:55,149 --> 01:10:57,715
Smaller venue. They've got
no dressing rooms over there.

955
01:10:57,735 --> 01:10:59,715
It's a starter, Micky.

956
01:11:03,952 --> 01:11:04,950
Hey.

957
01:11:06,183 --> 01:11:07,401
Good luck.

958
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:18,537
That's it. That's it.

959
01:11:23,499 --> 01:11:25,214
Yeah!

960
01:11:29,596 --> 01:11:31,519
Yeah!

961
01:12:52,769 --> 01:12:54,964
Visit for Dick Eklund.

962
01:12:54,988 --> 01:12:56,538
Dicky!

963
01:12:59,933 --> 01:13:02,844
Heard you won a bunch of fights, Mick.
That's good.

964
01:13:04,314 --> 01:13:08,412
I know you know what I'm doing.
I'm sure Alice and everybody else told you.

965
01:13:09,079 --> 01:13:11,876
I just wanted to tell you to your face myself.

966
01:13:11,899 --> 01:13:15,060
I've got a new manager and
Mickey O'Keefe's my trainer now.

967
01:13:15,499 --> 01:13:16,696
It's going good.

968
01:13:17,694 --> 01:13:21,004
Yeah. They've got you fighting Alfonso Sanchez.

969
01:13:21,028 --> 01:13:23,130
- On HBO.
- Bet you're proud of that.

970
01:13:23,147 --> 01:13:26,506
- Fucking right.
- HBO is the best at the Mexican fight. Wake up.

971
01:13:26,529 --> 01:13:29,816
I didn't think they were
going to be invested in me.

972
01:13:29,837 --> 01:13:32,432
- I've got a shot. I'm going to take it.
- Wake up.

973
01:13:32,446 --> 01:13:34,689
They don't care if it kills you.

974
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:37,247
Mike Toma did it. He's using you.

975
01:13:37,258 --> 01:13:39,485
Like a stepping stone for Sanchez.

976
01:13:41,255 --> 01:13:44,257
- Why don't you see?
- Oh, I see.

977
01:13:44,258 --> 01:13:48,112
How could I stand a chance without
the great Dick Eklund in my corner, right?

978
01:13:48,136 --> 01:13:50,728
You didn't give a fuck if I got
killed by Mungin,

979
01:13:50,747 --> 01:13:53,025
now, all of the sudden, you're worried
Sanchez is going to hurt me?

980
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:54,132
Why?

981
01:13:54,155 --> 01:13:57,314
Come on, Dick. Because you're stuck in here
and can't be the center of attention no more?

982
01:13:57,331 --> 01:13:59,568
- You need it that bad?
- It's a Mexican fight.

983
01:13:59,588 --> 01:14:02,429
He fights you,
hits like a fucking mule, all right?

984
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:04,644
Fifteen counts undefeated. You crazy?

985
01:14:04,645 --> 01:14:07,474
And that taxicab idiot, Lanano?
He went right for it.

986
01:14:07,491 --> 01:14:10,222
He's a paper gangster.
He's using you to steal money.

987
01:14:10,236 --> 01:14:12,966
Why can't you just shut up
and be happy for me?

988
01:14:13,553 --> 01:14:16,751
I've spent the last ten years of my life
in bad fights set up by you and Alice.

989
01:14:16,772 --> 01:14:21,226
I've finally got a good thing going for me,
and you can't be fucking happy for me? Why?

990
01:14:22,564 --> 01:14:24,666
What's your plan?
How are you going to fight Sanchez?

991
01:14:24,678 --> 01:14:26,615
I ain't going to talk about that.

992
01:14:26,631 --> 01:14:28,261
What's your plan?

993
01:14:28,731 --> 01:14:32,418
- I'm not here to talk about that.
- Bullshit. Yes you are.

994
01:14:33,546 --> 01:14:35,567
You watch the fight and you'll see the plan.

995
01:14:35,579 --> 01:14:39,019
I can't watch it. They don't let us.
It's too fucking violent, you know?

996
01:14:39,042 --> 01:14:40,258
Two minutes, Dicky.

997
01:14:40,273 --> 01:14:46,989
They let us watch a stupid documentary about crack,
but I can't watch my own brother fighting.

998
01:14:46,993 --> 01:14:50,245
Hey, Mick. What is it?

999
01:14:51,044 --> 01:14:55,500
You scared? You embarrassed because you don't
even have a plan? I'm your brother. Just tell me.

1000
01:14:55,511 --> 01:14:59,012
- You're going to shit on it no matter what I say.
- I'm not going to shit on it. Just tell me.

1001
01:15:02,257 --> 01:15:06,379
Go toe-to-toe, overhand right in middle rounds.
He's weak against overhand right.

1002
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:12,085
- Who came up with that? Fatty fuck O'Keefe?
- Fuck you, Dicky.

1003
01:15:12,097 --> 01:15:14,962
You've got to run against this guy.
Let him burn himself out.

1004
01:15:14,973 --> 01:15:17,438
Take it to the body, right?
Get inside, switch stances

1005
01:15:17,462 --> 01:15:20,239
like you're going to work his right.
Hit him on the left.

1006
01:15:20,263 --> 01:15:22,588
You ain't me.
Okay, you can't be me.

1007
01:15:22,611 --> 01:15:25,652
You had a hard enough time being you
when you had your fucking chance,

1008
01:15:25,672 --> 01:15:27,597
and that's why you're in here, all right?

1009
01:15:27,621 --> 01:15:29,159
I'll fight Sanchez the way I fight.

1010
01:15:29,168 --> 01:15:31,774
I'm talking about the way you fight,
you moron!

1011
01:15:33,066 --> 01:15:35,884
- You know I'm right. He knows I'm right.
- All right.

1012
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:41,165
Blow to the right.

1013
01:15:44,088 --> 01:15:48,808
Ward just in.
29 wins, 7 losses so far.

1014
01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:53,642
Twenty KOs. He's been a little better
since he refocused himself on the sport,

1015
01:15:53,650 --> 01:15:55,200
as J.B. pointed out.

1016
01:16:00,571 --> 01:16:03,366
Now here's Ward's opponent, Alfonso Sanchez,

1017
01:16:03,389 --> 01:16:08,541
out of Tijuana, Mexico.
See the record, 16 wins, 15 KOs,

1018
01:16:08,552 --> 01:16:10,389
8 first-round KOs.

1019
01:16:10,401 --> 01:16:14,487
There's Mike Toma, the promoter of the fight,
who has a lot invested in Sanchez.

1020
01:16:14,502 --> 01:16:18,345
He says that Sanchez is one of the most
talented young prospects

1021
01:16:18,357 --> 01:16:20,141
in the sport of boxing.

1022
01:16:29,297 --> 01:16:35,215
This is really one of the saddest
kinds of fights in boxing.

1023
01:16:35,238 --> 01:16:39,420
Micky Ward is 31 years old.
He's here because he needs the money.

1024
01:16:39,432 --> 01:16:41,720
- He's taking a beating.
- My point is that

1025
01:16:41,732 --> 01:16:44,010
he doesn't really have to sit here
and take this beating.

1026
01:16:44,022 --> 01:16:46,547
- He can do something about it.
- Which is what?

1027
01:16:46,571 --> 01:16:49,154
- Have his corner throw in the towel?
- Or fight back.

1028
01:16:52,357 --> 01:16:55,445
You can see his power.
Every time he hits Ward, he backs him up.

1029
01:16:59,130 --> 01:17:02,640
- Unless the referee thinks he can't...
- The referee should just stop this fight.

1030
01:17:02,652 --> 01:17:04,777
We know that Micky doesn't want to be here.

1031
01:17:04,794 --> 01:17:07,588
- I wouldn't make the crowd...
- No, he's fighting scared, Dick.

1032
01:17:08,738 --> 01:17:10,793
Running away, not hitting back.

1033
01:17:10,810 --> 01:17:14,306
Oh, Jesus. He's going to get hurt.

1034
01:17:14,317 --> 01:17:19,062
Doing the same old shit.
Never seen such an embarrassing performance.

1035
01:17:19,084 --> 01:17:21,139
He's doing what I told him, Mom.
He's doing what I told him.

1036
01:17:21,151 --> 01:17:22,994
Don't worry about it.
He's doing what I told him.

1037
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,876
Micky Ward showing nothing but respect.

1038
01:17:25,894 --> 01:17:27,808
What are you running around for?
Stop running around.

1039
01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:31,033
Shut the fuck up, Sal.
Shut the fuck up!

1040
01:17:31,043 --> 01:17:33,896
I don't know what you're doing, Micky.
You want to fucking tell me?

1041
01:17:33,908 --> 01:17:36,291
Because I don't know what you're doing.
We'd have lost all five rounds.

1042
01:17:36,308 --> 01:17:38,246
Is that what you want?

1043
01:17:38,263 --> 01:17:40,342
This is dreadful, dreadful stuff.

1044
01:17:40,365 --> 01:17:42,719
You've got to show me something soon,
Mick, or I'm going to stop the fight.

1045
01:17:42,736 --> 01:17:44,227
They're going to stop the fight, Micky.

1046
01:17:44,236 --> 01:17:46,138
He's got to go inside, Mom.

1047
01:17:46,151 --> 01:17:49,164
He's got to take it to the body.
He's got it.

1048
01:17:49,165 --> 01:17:52,124
- Don't stop the fight.
- They're going to stop this fight.

1049
01:17:52,135 --> 01:17:54,718
You've got to do something, baby.
You've got to do something.

1050
01:17:54,733 --> 01:17:58,244
Try what we talked about, Micky.
We had a plan, and you're not doing it.

1051
01:17:58,261 --> 01:18:00,247
- Let's go.
- All right, Micky.

1052
01:18:00,259 --> 01:18:04,791
You've lost the first five rounds,
what's the next strategy going to be?

1053
01:18:04,815 --> 01:18:08,176
Double right hand by Sanchez,
then a triple left hook.

1054
01:18:08,177 --> 01:18:12,389
Couple of the left hooks landed flush
on the cheek of Micky Ward.

1055
01:18:12,401 --> 01:18:14,583
Ward tying Sanchez up.

1056
01:18:14,596 --> 01:18:17,696
Very curious performance by Micky Ward.

1057
01:18:17,719 --> 01:18:23,159
Ward seems to be trying to land one big shot
to either change Sanchez's mind...

1058
01:18:23,179 --> 01:18:27,688
And he's beginning to open up, taking
advantage of opportunities to get close to Ward

1059
01:18:27,711 --> 01:18:33,464
and throw against a fighter who is
not defending himself by punching.

1060
01:18:33,484 --> 01:18:36,312
Sanchez is going to try to end this fight.

1061
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:44,118
What are you doing? Come on.

1062
01:18:46,193 --> 01:18:46,887
Come on!

1063
01:18:47,832 --> 01:18:50,333
He's down on an uppercut.

1064
01:18:53,261 --> 01:18:56,059
Nicely thrown left uppercut inside.

1065
01:18:56,069 --> 01:19:00,261
Very good. And right after Ward
threw a pretty good right hand.

1066
01:19:00,279 --> 01:19:01,523
Mick, you all right?

1067
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:06,555
This is a fight that should be stopped.

1068
01:19:06,566 --> 01:19:09,554
- Come on, head, body, head.
- Ugh.

1069
01:19:11,101 --> 01:19:15,492
- This is not professional.
- That's exactly what I'm saying.

1070
01:19:15,503 --> 01:19:17,605
I sure wish they paid me to watch this.

1071
01:19:18,725 --> 01:19:21,477
Come on, Mick!
Head, body, head.

1072
01:19:22,743 --> 01:19:25,573
That was a good body shot by Ward.

1073
01:19:25,587 --> 01:19:29,210
- Maybe he'll turn it around.
- I'm talking about his body shot.

1074
01:19:30,486 --> 01:19:33,138
Sanchez dropped by that shot!
Oh, my God!

1075
01:19:33,151 --> 01:19:34,754
What a punch!

1076
01:19:34,766 --> 01:19:37,516
The most unlikely knockout
you have ever seen!

1077
01:19:37,528 --> 01:19:39,382
That is a kidney shot,

1078
01:19:39,383 --> 01:19:43,069
The kind of kidney shot that's not as severe...

1079
01:19:43,083 --> 01:19:44,532
Yeah!

1080
01:19:45,133 --> 01:19:48,220
I still don't believe what I just saw!

1081
01:19:48,255 --> 01:19:52,302
Micky! Micky! Micky!

1082
01:19:52,314 --> 01:19:53,887
Micky won!

1083
01:19:55,783 --> 01:20:00,808
Now did Micky Ward just make idiots of us all
with a spectacular piece of strategy?

1084
01:20:00,820 --> 01:20:03,287
- Take another look.
- Amazing.

1085
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:05,588
A big win in the career of Micky Ward
of Lowell, Mass.

1086
01:20:05,605 --> 01:20:09,151
Unbelievable defeat at the hands of Micky Ward,

1087
01:20:09,168 --> 01:20:13,595
who had all but given away the first
half dozen rounds in the bout.

1088
01:20:13,610 --> 01:20:17,602
I think what Micky did was he recognized
that he'd hurt the guy with the body shot.

1089
01:20:17,625 --> 01:20:20,772
Micky's a better fighter than that
to not be running from that guy like that.

1090
01:20:20,795 --> 01:20:22,979
Theater of the unexpected.

1091
01:20:23,002 --> 01:20:25,727
Hey, you never know
what can happen, right?

1092
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:27,858
Never give up in this game, right?
Never give up.

1093
01:20:27,883 --> 01:20:29,539
You can't make it up, folks.

1094
01:20:29,556 --> 01:20:33,031
You know what Micky just said?
He said you can't give up in this game.

1095
01:20:33,032 --> 01:20:36,390
Well maybe Micky Ward heard me say
he should stop this fight,

1096
01:20:36,402 --> 01:20:39,619
- and he went out and stopped it.
- Yeah.

1097
01:20:39,949 --> 01:20:41,276
I can't believe it.

1098
01:20:41,288 --> 01:20:44,429
I'm looking over and I'm thinking
to myself like they were thinking:

1099
01:20:44,435 --> 01:20:45,668
This thing is over.

1100
01:20:45,692 --> 01:20:47,782
But I tell you what.
Even look at the commentators.

1101
01:20:47,793 --> 01:20:51,198
They started to take their headsets off
before he was even counted out.

1102
01:20:51,222 --> 01:20:53,535
- They just wanted to get out of there.
- Mick. Mick...

1103
01:20:53,541 --> 01:20:56,699
I just spoke to Mike Toma again and
he just told me something very interesting.

1104
01:20:56,711 --> 01:21:01,674
He just told me, had Sanchez won tonight,
he would have gotten the title shot.

1105
01:21:01,675 --> 01:21:04,793
- Holy Christ, that's beautiful.
- Why? Why is that beautiful?

1106
01:21:04,816 --> 01:21:09,584
- A title shot.
- Micky gets the shot.

1107
01:21:09,609 --> 01:21:12,239
- Are you sure about that?
- You've got to be very clear about this,

1108
01:21:12,251 --> 01:21:14,506
- because this is my kid's future.
- I just spoke to the guy.

1109
01:21:14,517 --> 01:21:17,981
- Mike, come here. Look, tell these guys.
- Hey. Congratulations.

1110
01:21:17,987 --> 01:21:19,889
- Thank you.
- Not a stepping stone anymore.

1111
01:21:19,902 --> 01:21:22,509
I always knew you had the talent.
That was a hell of a strategy,

1112
01:21:22,532 --> 01:21:25,081
wearing him down like that
and taking it to the body.

1113
01:21:25,104 --> 01:21:27,753
Thirty years in the business,
I've never seen a knockout like that.

1114
01:21:27,757 --> 01:21:31,233
Larry Merchant was writing your obituary
and Sanchez drops like he was shot with a gun.

1115
01:21:31,238 --> 01:21:32,760
Where did you get that?

1116
01:21:32,772 --> 01:21:35,966
That's the first thing my brother taught me.
Tap them to the head, dig into the body.

1117
01:21:35,981 --> 01:21:37,989
- That's a hell of a body shot.
- Thank you.

1118
01:21:37,996 --> 01:21:39,382
You ready for a title shot?

1119
01:21:39,407 --> 01:21:42,190
- Yes!
- Yes!

1120
01:21:42,208 --> 01:21:45,836
- That's what I was talking about.
- He's ready. You're ready, aren't you?

1121
01:21:45,842 --> 01:21:49,481
Shea Neary in London for the title!

1122
01:21:49,505 --> 01:21:51,806
Are you kidding me?
We've got some celebrating to do.

1123
01:21:51,817 --> 01:21:53,755
- Yeah, I think so.
- Thank you so much.

1124
01:21:53,778 --> 01:21:56,263
You're going to have
a great champion, my boy.

1125
01:21:58,311 --> 01:22:00,659
It's what your brother
would have always wanted.

1126
01:22:00,683 --> 01:22:02,291
He's not even going to be there.

1127
01:22:28,429 --> 01:22:31,658
- Hey!
- Daddy!

1128
01:22:31,672 --> 01:22:33,880
- Hey there, buddy.
- Daddy, Daddy!

1129
01:22:34,988 --> 01:22:38,288
Good to see you! Oh!

1130
01:22:38,306 --> 01:22:42,498
That's a good hug!
That's a good hug! Oh yeah!

1131
01:22:42,504 --> 01:22:44,829
- Sweetheart!
- Hi, Mom.

1132
01:22:44,852 --> 01:22:47,412
Oh, you look so good.

1133
01:22:47,435 --> 01:22:48,973
Oh, my God.

1134
01:22:57,706 --> 01:23:00,699
- You have clean teeth.
- I do! Look at my teeth!

1135
01:23:00,711 --> 01:23:02,930
I got new teeth. Everything.

1136
01:23:02,947 --> 01:23:04,415
How do you think I look?

1137
01:23:04,427 --> 01:23:05,789
- Good.
- Yeah?

1138
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:19,608
- Are you going to carry me?
- No.

1139
01:23:19,631 --> 01:23:22,508
And more cake. Ice cream...

1140
01:23:22,532 --> 01:23:26,594
- Ice cream with cake.
- Ice cream with cake and cake and cake.

1141
01:23:26,935 --> 01:23:30,287
Ice cream, cake and cake.
Ice cream, cake and cake.

1142
01:23:30,302 --> 01:23:31,429
Quacker!

1143
01:23:37,178 --> 01:23:38,152
Mom.

1144
01:23:51,602 --> 01:23:54,185
- They gave you some new teeth, huh?
- Yeah.

1145
01:23:59,079 --> 01:24:02,414
- Hey, George. They let you out of the house now?
- Ha, yeah.

1146
01:24:02,425 --> 01:24:06,241
- Run him out of the house, Mom?
- Hey, look. I want you to meet Sal Lanano.

1147
01:24:12,835 --> 01:24:14,613
How you doing, Dicky?

1148
01:24:16,964 --> 01:24:18,749
Let's spar, huh?

1149
01:24:26,664 --> 01:24:27,779
Hi, Charlene.

1150
01:24:53,926 --> 01:24:57,143
- Welcome back!
- Shh! It's supposed to be a surprise!

1151
01:24:57,166 --> 01:24:59,116
I'm running late.

1152
01:24:59,127 --> 01:25:01,393
- Hey.
- Hey.

1153
01:25:01,408 --> 01:25:05,025
Mick, I can't even tell you.
Being back in this smelly-ass locker room...

1154
01:25:05,036 --> 01:25:07,796
Getting back with you is what got me through.

1155
01:25:07,803 --> 01:25:09,623
You look good. Your eyes are clear.

1156
01:25:09,646 --> 01:25:12,171
- Yeah?
- You know...

1157
01:25:13,294 --> 01:25:16,072
Alice says prison might have been
the best thing for me.

1158
01:25:16,088 --> 01:25:19,411
It got me clean. Got me clear up here.

1159
01:25:20,867 --> 01:25:22,653
It's a beautiful thing, Dick.

1160
01:25:24,223 --> 01:25:26,225
I've got to talk to you about something.

1161
01:25:27,076 --> 01:25:27,863
Yeah.

1162
01:25:30,644 --> 01:25:32,687
The old locker, huh?

1163
01:25:35,706 --> 01:25:38,465
I made a promise to them
I wouldn't work with you again.

1164
01:25:47,254 --> 01:25:48,240
Huh?

1165
01:25:49,038 --> 01:25:52,312
I had to, after everything that happened.
I'm sorry.

1166
01:25:57,634 --> 01:25:59,456
You sticking to that?

1167
01:26:01,594 --> 01:26:03,367
I'm glad you're back.

1168
01:26:03,895 --> 01:26:05,187
You look good.

1169
01:26:06,338 --> 01:26:08,393
I don't know what else to say.

1170
01:26:16,172 --> 01:26:19,177
- Mick, you fucking kidding me?
- No, I'm not.

1171
01:26:24,053 --> 01:26:26,507
- Hey, Micky.
- Micky, come on in.

1172
01:26:26,530 --> 01:26:29,787
You're too loud.
You've got to do this at home, please.

1173
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:33,655
- What are you talking about?
- Mom, please.

1174
01:26:34,896 --> 01:26:37,456
All right, girls. Let's pack it up.

1175
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:05,005
- Why?
- Let's get it put away.

1176
01:27:05,017 --> 01:27:08,833
If that's what Micky wants,
we're going to put it away.

1177
01:27:08,851 --> 01:27:11,653
- There's your brother.
- Dicky!

1178
01:27:12,721 --> 01:27:15,128
Hey there. Hey there.

1179
01:27:18,783 --> 01:27:21,270
It's nice. It's nice.

1180
01:27:21,765 --> 01:27:24,454
- Been working on it for two weeks.
- Hey, Sherri, come on. Stop.

1181
01:27:24,477 --> 01:27:28,434
All right, girls, come on. Let's go home.
It's not the time to do this, obviously.

1182
01:27:33,699 --> 01:27:37,347
- What's going on?
- We ain't going to work together.

1183
01:27:37,371 --> 01:27:39,332
They don't want me to work with him.

1184
01:27:39,355 --> 01:27:41,330
What are you talking about?

1185
01:27:41,777 --> 01:27:43,655
That's not right.

1186
01:27:44,096 --> 01:27:46,984
Micky never would have
won Sanchez without Dicky.

1187
01:27:47,007 --> 01:27:50,694
- That's fucking bullshit! Take it back!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1188
01:27:50,706 --> 01:27:54,393
- Don't you fucking talk to my mother like that.
- Fuck you!

1189
01:27:56,913 --> 01:27:58,867
Why don't you ask Micky?

1190
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:01,809
We're going to train. They've got to go.

1191
01:28:01,822 --> 01:28:03,795
They've got to go, Mick.
Come on.

1192
01:28:03,810 --> 01:28:05,688
- You all right?
- Ask him, George.

1193
01:28:05,700 --> 01:28:08,643
Ask him if he would have won Sanchez
without his brother.

1194
01:28:12,347 --> 01:28:15,126
No, I wouldn't have won Sanchez
if it wasn't for Dicky.

1195
01:28:15,896 --> 01:28:18,892
- How can you say that to O'Keefe?
- Because it's true.

1196
01:28:19,568 --> 01:28:23,480
I went in with our game plan and it wasn't working
so I went back to what I learned with Dicky.

1197
01:28:23,494 --> 01:28:26,194
And I wouldn't have won without you,
either, O'Keefe, okay?

1198
01:28:27,134 --> 01:28:30,303
I mean, you know that.
We worked hard. You got me ready.

1199
01:28:30,314 --> 01:28:33,011
You got your confidence
and your focus from O'Keefe,

1200
01:28:33,023 --> 01:28:35,876
and from Sal,
and from your father, and from me.

1201
01:28:38,314 --> 01:28:40,087
- Dicky is a junk bag.
- Hey!

1202
01:28:40,110 --> 01:28:41,437
He's a junk bag!

1203
01:28:41,449 --> 01:28:43,032
- Fuck you, Charlene.
- Oh, fuck you!

1204
01:28:43,056 --> 01:28:44,118
I'm sober.

1205
01:28:44,121 --> 01:28:46,869
Oh, yeah. And I'm sure you're going to need
something for something now that you're out.

1206
01:28:46,893 --> 01:28:48,642
- "Oh, my back! Oh, my back!"
- Fuck you!

1207
01:28:48,659 --> 01:28:50,949
- What are you always picking on me for, huh?
- No, fuck you!

1208
01:28:50,961 --> 01:28:53,324
And what about O'Keefe?
We're in the same boat.

1209
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:56,101
One day at a fucking time, right, O'Keefe?
You and me.

1210
01:28:56,111 --> 01:28:58,858
It's all right for him to be here?
Why am I the fucking problem?

1211
01:28:58,869 --> 01:29:01,018
- I'm his blood! I'm his family!
- You're the problem!

1212
01:29:01,038 --> 01:29:04,596
I'm the one fighting, okay?
Not you, not you, and not you.

1213
01:29:05,949 --> 01:29:07,883
- I know what I need.
- And you need Dicky?

1214
01:29:07,906 --> 01:29:09,327
I want Dicky back.

1215
01:29:10,822 --> 01:29:13,100
And I want you, Charlene,
and I want O'Keefe.

1216
01:29:13,112 --> 01:29:15,355
I want my family.
What's wrong with that?

1217
01:29:17,473 --> 01:29:20,467
- Not the deal we made, baby.
- She's right, Micky.

1218
01:29:20,491 --> 01:29:23,173
- That's not the deal.
- It wasn't the deal.

1219
01:29:23,196 --> 01:29:25,082
Come on, you can't do this to us.

1220
01:29:25,105 --> 01:29:26,362
You sound like them now.

1221
01:29:26,373 --> 01:29:28,158
- I sound like them now?
- Yeah, you sound like them.

1222
01:29:28,181 --> 01:29:31,715
- We sound like them?
- You can't do this to us. You can't do this to us.

1223
01:29:31,725 --> 01:29:33,076
You sound like them.

1224
01:29:34,446 --> 01:29:36,254
You should fucking listen to yourself.

1225
01:29:36,267 --> 01:29:38,920
You sound like them, just like them.
Maybe this is where you belong.

1226
01:29:38,932 --> 01:29:41,311
- That's the way you love him?
- Charlene!

1227
01:29:41,334 --> 01:29:44,715
- Come on!
- You want your brother? Good luck.

1228
01:29:44,739 --> 01:29:47,424
- O'Keefe, come on...
- Micky.

1229
01:29:47,436 --> 01:29:48,481
Micky...

1230
01:29:51,563 --> 01:29:53,991
Come on,
everything happens for a reason.

1231
01:29:54,996 --> 01:29:56,840
You know, maybe it's for the best.

1232
01:29:58,354 --> 01:29:59,951
God has a plan.

1233
01:30:02,530 --> 01:30:04,603
Want to spar with your brother?

1234
01:30:11,105 --> 01:30:12,995
Dick Eklund, Pride of Lowell.

1235
01:30:14,299 --> 01:30:16,330
Watching that for years, huh?

1236
01:30:19,976 --> 01:30:23,217
Whoa, hey, what the hell are you doing?

1237
01:30:23,933 --> 01:30:26,740
- Micky, for crying out loud!
- Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

1238
01:30:26,745 --> 01:30:30,590
Take that baby out of here.
I told you take him away ten minutes ago!

1239
01:30:30,596 --> 01:30:33,379
Sweetheart, are you all right?
You okay? Your back?

1240
01:30:34,758 --> 01:30:37,804
What are you doing?
What's the matter with you?

1241
01:30:37,816 --> 01:30:39,930
Will it be my fight, Alice? Huh?

1242
01:30:39,941 --> 01:30:44,057
Just once? Maybe just
this one time, not for Dicky?

1243
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:45,430
Huh?

1244
01:30:45,448 --> 01:30:47,573
I know you think he's coming back,

1245
01:30:47,596 --> 01:30:51,189
but he's forty years old and he doesn't have
a tooth in his head that's his fucking own.

1246
01:30:51,206 --> 01:30:54,576
Let your brother talk
for a minute here, all right?

1247
01:30:54,594 --> 01:30:59,176
- What are you saying, sweetheart?
- Shut up before I bust your fucking head open, Dicky.

1248
01:30:59,188 --> 01:31:02,223
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What are you going to do?

1249
01:31:02,235 --> 01:31:05,295
- You want me to bust your fucking head open?
- Come on! Come on! George!

1250
01:31:05,318 --> 01:31:07,224
- Please! Please!
- Dicky!

1251
01:31:07,246 --> 01:31:09,794
What are you saying, sweetheart?
Tell me what you're saying.

1252
01:31:09,818 --> 01:31:11,732
This is supposed to be my fight.

1253
01:31:11,756 --> 01:31:13,200
- This is my shot at a title.
- It is your fight.

1254
01:31:13,212 --> 01:31:14,480
I won't get another one after this.

1255
01:31:14,504 --> 01:31:17,005
Am I being selfish?
Am I saying "Micky! Micky! Micky!"?

1256
01:31:17,028 --> 01:31:18,994
Because you know what?
If I am, I'm sorry.

1257
01:31:19,008 --> 01:31:22,983
I thought I was fighting for the championship.
And I thought you were my mother, too.

1258
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:25,962
I am your mother.

1259
01:31:30,792 --> 01:31:35,144
Mick, I'm sorry. I had no idea
you felt like that, all right?

1260
01:31:35,168 --> 01:31:38,266
If I made mistakes,
I'm going to be better.

1261
01:31:38,277 --> 01:31:42,093
I don't want to hurt you.
I am so sorry.

1262
01:31:42,117 --> 01:31:44,054
I'm sorry.

1263
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:51,436
Dicky!
Stay with him.

1264
01:31:52,364 --> 01:31:53,890
Dicky!

1265
01:31:55,416 --> 01:31:56,790
Dicky!

1266
01:32:01,686 --> 01:32:03,835
- Dicky!
- Got to do something.

1267
01:32:03,847 --> 01:32:05,749
Dicky, wait. Come on.

1268
01:32:06,688 --> 01:32:09,060
Micky wants you. I want you.

1269
01:32:09,447 --> 01:32:13,065
- I've got to do something.
- I know what that means. Don't do this!

1270
01:32:41,315 --> 01:32:43,194
Hey, Jim.

1271
01:32:47,937 --> 01:32:49,358
- Smart.
- Hey, Dicky.

1272
01:32:52,286 --> 01:32:54,705
- Hey, Dicky's back!
- Yay!

1273
01:32:54,728 --> 01:32:56,395
- Hey!
- Dicky!

1274
01:32:57,608 --> 01:33:00,109
- Look at you!
- Look at my boy, huh?

1275
01:33:00,121 --> 01:33:01,260
Come over here.

1276
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:02,941
You look good. Welcome back.

1277
01:33:02,955 --> 01:33:05,409
- Yeah, you're looking good.
- You look great.

1278
01:33:05,433 --> 01:33:07,441
Good to see you.

1279
01:33:07,459 --> 01:33:10,194
- Welcome home.
- Hi, honey.

1280
01:33:11,855 --> 01:33:13,722
What's up, man? You're looking good.

1281
01:33:13,725 --> 01:33:16,003
So, want to head up there?

1282
01:33:16,026 --> 01:33:17,423
Dicky's back!

1283
01:33:22,750 --> 01:33:25,662
Go upstairs, take a while, huh?

1284
01:33:33,467 --> 01:33:36,332
- Throw a little party for you, babe.
- Hey, come back!

1285
01:33:38,370 --> 01:33:40,850
- The fuck was that all about?
- What the hell was that?

1286
01:33:56,167 --> 01:33:58,399
Charlene, it's Dicky.

1287
01:34:00,303 --> 01:34:02,900
Get off my porch, you piece of shit.

1288
01:34:05,031 --> 01:34:06,742
How fucking dare you come?

1289
01:34:08,277 --> 01:34:10,260
Cock sucker!

1290
01:34:10,261 --> 01:34:11,447
Fucking boy!

1291
01:34:11,453 --> 01:34:12,439
Fucking ass!

1292
01:34:12,451 --> 01:34:13,261
Fucking sick!

1293
01:34:14,564 --> 01:34:17,592
You're a fucking asshole, Dicky.
I want you off my fucking porch.

1294
01:34:17,615 --> 01:34:21,513
Huh? Why don't you just fucking
come down here and talk to me, huh?

1295
01:34:21,537 --> 01:34:23,459
You're such an asshole,
coming to my fucking house.

1296
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:25,654
- You piece of shit, standing on my porch!
- Sorry, sorry.

1297
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:29,260
It's not fucking ladylike to be shouting
in the street like this, all right?

1298
01:34:29,272 --> 01:34:31,972
- You're such a fucking cock sucker, coming over here.
- Please!

1299
01:34:31,984 --> 01:34:33,933
- Oh yeah? You think I fucking care?
- Come on. Just fucking...

1300
01:34:33,945 --> 01:34:36,233
Get off my fucking porch, Dicky.

1301
01:34:49,929 --> 01:34:52,285
What kind of dog is that?
Is that a cocker spaniel?

1302
01:34:58,617 --> 01:35:00,237
All right,
I know you can't fucking stand me.

1303
01:35:00,249 --> 01:35:03,596
- Really, what makes you say that?
- I got news for you, all right?

1304
01:35:03,619 --> 01:35:05,346
My brother loves you,

1305
01:35:05,371 --> 01:35:07,778
and you can't just run away because of me.

1306
01:35:07,790 --> 01:35:12,704
You don't deserve that, all right?
So I will quit if you want me to quit.

1307
01:35:12,716 --> 01:35:15,106
- You're full of shit.
- I swear to God.

1308
01:35:15,118 --> 01:35:17,324
I will quit if it means
you'll come back, all right?

1309
01:35:17,348 --> 01:35:19,133
But I want you to
think about something.

1310
01:35:19,148 --> 01:35:22,237
Micky has a chance to do
something that I never did,

1311
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:24,491
that in my time, I never had.

1312
01:35:24,515 --> 01:35:27,676
Oh... "Yeah, my big chance was with
Sugar Ray Leonard. I'm so great."

1313
01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:30,999
"I'm the Pride of fucking Lowell.
Oh yeah, I fought Sugar Ray Leonard."

1314
01:35:31,023 --> 01:35:32,678
- I've heard it.
- I came to make things right with you.

1315
01:35:32,690 --> 01:35:35,647
Okay, let's make things right.
Number one:

1316
01:35:35,659 --> 01:35:37,925
You didn't knock down
Sugar Ray Leonard. He tripped.

1317
01:35:40,371 --> 01:35:44,962
I was in the ring. Don't you think I know
what really fucking happened that day?

1318
01:35:44,977 --> 01:35:47,466
- What have you ever done with your life?
- I like my life.

1319
01:35:47,490 --> 01:35:49,320
- Yeah? What have you ever done with it?
- I like my life now, Dicky.

1320
01:35:49,332 --> 01:35:51,481
What have you ever done with your life?

1321
01:35:51,494 --> 01:35:55,275
You're a college dropout, Charlene.
You're just a little bar girl. Your life sucks.

1322
01:35:57,323 --> 01:35:58,385
All right.

1323
01:35:59,577 --> 01:36:02,724
I drink too much.
I worked in a lot of bars.

1324
01:36:02,743 --> 01:36:05,995
And I ruined a lot of opportunities,
but I'm trying to do better here.

1325
01:36:06,019 --> 01:36:08,026
- So is Micky.
- So am I.

1326
01:36:10,056 --> 01:36:14,424
And he needs me, you heard him.
And I know he needs you.

1327
01:36:18,019 --> 01:36:19,991
What is that blue shit on your arm?

1328
01:36:21,260 --> 01:36:22,708
It's icing.

1329
01:36:26,191 --> 01:36:27,854
Okay.

1330
01:36:27,866 --> 01:36:30,531
I'll see you in Micky's corner.
Otherwise, go fuck yourself.

1331
01:36:30,555 --> 01:36:32,655
- It's a deal.
- All right, it's a deal.

1332
01:36:45,021 --> 01:36:47,266
We worked it out for you. Ask her.

1333
01:36:49,002 --> 01:36:52,137
Good. Go get O'Keefe back, too.

1334
01:36:53,725 --> 01:36:54,944
I will.

1335
01:37:00,736 --> 01:37:01,881
Hey, Mick.

1336
01:37:04,172 --> 01:37:06,356
Do you think I knocked down
Sugar Ray Leonard?

1337
01:37:07,831 --> 01:37:10,743
You went ten rounds. One of the best
to do anything to hurt him.

1338
01:37:11,718 --> 01:37:12,951
You're my hero.

1339
01:37:14,178 --> 01:37:15,589
I was.

1340
01:37:17,544 --> 01:37:18,906
I was...

1341
01:37:24,349 --> 01:37:27,531
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah?

1342
01:38:46,098 --> 01:38:48,575
There's a press conference downstairs.

1343
01:38:48,576 --> 01:38:51,006
- Come on. Let's go.
- Guys...

1344
01:38:52,481 --> 01:38:56,520
Neary: Ten stone, six pounds.

1345
01:39:02,917 --> 01:39:07,318
Ward: Ten stone, six pounds.

1346
01:39:08,648 --> 01:39:11,513
Hey, Micky. Micky Ward!
We have a question over here.

1347
01:39:13,309 --> 01:39:14,811
How have you been training?

1348
01:39:14,835 --> 01:39:18,310
- I train. I train hard.
- Shea's 22 in 0. Never been knocked down.

1349
01:39:18,333 --> 01:39:20,224
Well that's going to change tomorrow.

1350
01:39:20,235 --> 01:39:22,424
In fact we expected a much better fighter.

1351
01:39:23,161 --> 01:39:26,765
I'm just grateful to be here and have
the opportunity. Thank you, guys, for the shot.

1352
01:39:26,774 --> 01:39:29,381
Shea, who do you respect as a fighter?

1353
01:39:29,390 --> 01:39:32,126
And who would you like to fight next?

1354
01:39:32,130 --> 01:39:34,772
I plan on moving
right through Micky Ward tomorrow,

1355
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:37,508
moving on to other big fighters,
like Gatti.

1356
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:39,868
I believe Gatti and I would
make a great match.

1357
01:39:53,952 --> 01:39:57,240
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
twelve rounds of boxing

1358
01:39:57,263 --> 01:40:03,651
for the WBU Welterweight
Championship of the World!

1359
01:40:50,147 --> 01:40:52,483
Don't listen to them, Mick.

1360
01:41:05,504 --> 01:41:08,968
And there is Micky Ward
of Lowell, Massachusetts entering the ring.

1361
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:11,939
It's his first fight outside the United States.

1362
01:41:11,953 --> 01:41:14,783
Micky Ward, 30 wins, 7 losses....

1363
01:41:14,806 --> 01:41:18,094
He's back and better, recently.
Twenty KOs.

1364
01:41:18,106 --> 01:41:22,678
And now Ward awaits his opponent,
Shea Neary.

1365
01:41:22,693 --> 01:41:27,476
Neary regards himself as
the European Arturo Gatti,

1366
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:30,764
meaning that he is a head-on
high-contact fighter

1367
01:41:30,776 --> 01:41:34,474
who throws seventy punches per round.

1368
01:41:34,492 --> 01:41:38,554
Neary is from Liverpool and should
have a huge following her tonight.

1369
01:41:40,457 --> 01:41:44,763
Accompanied by "Paint the Town Red"
by the Mahones.

1370
01:41:44,782 --> 01:41:48,204
Neary is the current
Welterweight Champion of the World.

1371
01:41:48,228 --> 01:41:54,188
He is a very tough young man.
Beyond dedicated. Lives a spartan existence.

1372
01:41:54,189 --> 01:41:59,495
And according to his promoters,
there's nothing but eat, drink, think,

1373
01:41:59,506 --> 01:42:03,369
fantasize and dream of fighting.

1374
01:42:03,393 --> 01:42:06,994
Shea Neary has had 22 professional fights
and won them all.

1375
01:42:06,995 --> 01:42:09,556
Seventeen KOs.

1376
01:42:19,289 --> 01:42:22,734
Start when you hear the bell.
Shake hands.

1377
01:42:23,352 --> 01:42:26,323
Both of you. Shake hands.

1378
01:42:27,511 --> 01:42:33,263
As close as we just saw them in the middle
of the ring, forehead to forehead.

1379
01:42:33,264 --> 01:42:39,751
That's how close we expect them to be
for as long as this fight goes on.

1380
01:42:39,772 --> 01:42:43,799
Ward is a long ways from home.
Don't coast in a foreign country.

1381
01:42:43,822 --> 01:42:48,753
Well the big challenge for Ward is to get off
to a faster start than is customary for him.

1382
01:42:48,754 --> 01:42:52,303
Micky Ward a notoriously slow starter
in big fights.

1383
01:42:52,313 --> 01:42:54,802
Shea Neary an ultra-fast starter.

1384
01:42:54,817 --> 01:42:59,241
And that's the question that hovers
over round one. Get ready for the fight.

1385
01:42:59,260 --> 01:43:02,254
Already Shea Neary starts
taking it to him on the ropes.

1386
01:43:02,278 --> 01:43:05,801
And Neary going to the body,
which is Ward's specialty.

1387
01:43:06,341 --> 01:43:09,288
- Whoa!
- Neary bangs Ward to the body.

1388
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:13,433
- And a big uppercut by Neary.
- Neary leads off with a good left jab.

1389
01:43:13,439 --> 01:43:17,067
Keeps opponents off balance,
jabbing here and there.

1390
01:43:19,398 --> 01:43:23,079
That was a good left hook by Neary
as he stepped in on Ward.

1391
01:43:23,090 --> 01:43:27,939
Ward not able to deal with him very well
when Neary stands at range like this.

1392
01:43:27,950 --> 01:43:30,627
- Come on!
- That's it! Get him!

1393
01:43:31,660 --> 01:43:34,090
My, is it tough for Micky Ward.

1394
01:43:34,108 --> 01:43:39,442
Neary digging his own right hand to the body.
They trade shots at close range.

1395
01:43:39,466 --> 01:43:42,309
Ward is trying to match Neary blow-for-blow,

1396
01:43:42,333 --> 01:43:47,333
and now Neary starts to come on
and take the last thirty seconds to the round.

1397
01:43:47,346 --> 01:43:49,776
- How about that!
- Break!

1398
01:43:51,184 --> 01:43:55,845
Tremendous barrage in the first minute.
Just look at this. Unbelievable.

1399
01:43:55,857 --> 01:43:58,350
What a great round one!

1400
01:43:58,374 --> 01:44:02,450
Ward is going to have to
pick up the tempo

1401
01:44:02,462 --> 01:44:04,352
and beat him with volumes of punching.

1402
01:44:04,358 --> 01:44:06,706
No doubt Neary is a better boxer.

1403
01:44:09,821 --> 01:44:14,929
Four hard right hands
Neary has belted in the last minute.

1404
01:44:14,939 --> 01:44:19,917
Quicker than Ward, more assertive than Ward.
Surer of what he wants to do.

1405
01:44:19,928 --> 01:44:23,094
They're standing and trading shots
at the center of the ring.

1406
01:44:23,106 --> 01:44:26,172
Ward's going to have to step it up
a little bit more than he is right now.

1407
01:44:26,189 --> 01:44:29,735
Micky Ward's corner taking
a really deep look at what's going on now,

1408
01:44:29,758 --> 01:44:32,964
and his family at ringside
well aware he's stepping up in class.

1409
01:44:32,981 --> 01:44:36,764
Ward has to got to be more aggressive.

1410
01:44:36,774 --> 01:44:39,473
He can't just try to wait until
everything is perfect.

1411
01:44:39,485 --> 01:44:42,115
Despondence over Micky Ward
is increasing as the fight goes on

1412
01:44:42,129 --> 01:44:46,249
because his plan was the right one
and he's executing it.

1413
01:44:46,268 --> 01:44:53,536
Punches like these make it seem
that it's now Neary's fight.

1414
01:44:54,986 --> 01:45:00,282
Ward hasn't been in this kind of war
with as strong a fighter as Neary.

1415
01:45:01,767 --> 01:45:05,332
They are trying to hurt each other
with only punches.

1416
01:45:05,339 --> 01:45:10,107
They've tested each other's will,
now they're testing each other's skill.

1417
01:45:10,118 --> 01:45:13,558
And Ward fumbled there
by a right cross from Neary.

1418
01:45:13,569 --> 01:45:19,951
- Ward hurting now, his legs are gone.
- Neary goes to the body as he tries to finish Micky.

1419
01:45:20,766 --> 01:45:26,601
- Vicious body shots from Neary.
- And Ward doesn't even try to move off the ropes.

1420
01:45:26,613 --> 01:45:31,580
I don't know if he can, Jeff.
He's waiting for Neary to punch himself out.

1421
01:45:31,581 --> 01:45:35,862
Down goes Micky Ward, and he may be out.

1422
01:45:37,568 --> 01:45:39,229
Come on, that's it!

1423
01:45:40,092 --> 01:45:41,830
That's my boy!

1424
01:45:41,835 --> 01:45:44,759
Forward! Forward!
Come on!

1425
01:45:46,278 --> 01:45:51,035
- Ward is out on his feet!
- Loser! Go back to America!

1426
01:45:51,046 --> 01:45:53,179
This could be it for Micky Ward.

1427
01:45:53,202 --> 01:45:55,855
Dicky, get him a fucking stool
Where's the stool?

1428
01:45:55,867 --> 01:45:58,523
Charlene, will you get the fuck
out of here with your high heels?

1429
01:45:59,442 --> 01:46:04,070
His brother's got Ward jumping
to wake up his legs.

1430
01:46:04,082 --> 01:46:07,556
I think this could be Ward's last chance
to turn this fight around.

1431
01:46:07,580 --> 01:46:12,400
It's Micky Ward against the aggressiveness
and clean punching of Shea Neary.

1432
01:46:13,337 --> 01:46:16,730
If you don't have your defense up
you can really get hurt.

1433
01:46:16,754 --> 01:46:19,460
He's making it very difficult for Micky Ward.

1434
01:46:19,472 --> 01:46:22,266
I don't think he's going to give it to him,
at this rate.

1435
01:46:22,290 --> 01:46:24,309
This is a survival move.

1436
01:46:24,331 --> 01:46:28,053
Are you like me? Huh?
Just good enough to fight Sugar Ray?

1437
01:46:28,077 --> 01:46:31,593
I never had to win, did I?
You've got to do more than that.

1438
01:46:31,616 --> 01:46:36,747
You've got to win a title.
For you, for me, for Lowell.

1439
01:46:36,770 --> 01:46:39,248
This is your time, all right?
You take it.

1440
01:46:39,272 --> 01:46:42,165
I had my time, and I blew it.
You don't have to, all right?

1441
01:46:42,234 --> 01:46:45,949
Now fucking get out there.
Bring that fucking anger.

1442
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:48,590
All the shit you've been through
over the fucking years,

1443
01:46:48,607 --> 01:46:51,235
put it in the ring right now.
This is yours. This is fucking yours.

1444
01:46:51,310 --> 01:46:54,160
- Okay.
- Fucking head, body, head, body.

1445
01:46:54,184 --> 01:46:57,671
- Say it back to me.
- Head, body, head, body.

1446
01:46:57,689 --> 01:47:01,578
You can do it.
Stay off the fucking ropes.

1447
01:47:06,272 --> 01:47:08,538
If I'm in Micky Ward's corner tonight,

1448
01:47:08,550 --> 01:47:12,107
I'm thinking if he doesn't pick things up
this round and get going,

1449

01:47:19,375 --> 01:47:23,097
Once again, Ward against the ropes
as Neary is free to attack.

1452
01:47:23,120 --> 01:47:25,500
What are you doing?
Come on, Mick...

1453
01:47:26,118 --> 01:47:29,838
Sometimes if you want to win,
you've got to be something that you're not.

1454
01:47:31,850 --> 01:47:33,511
Off the fucking rope, man!
That ain't it!

1455
01:47:33,955 --> 01:47:36,554
Neary continues to pound away.

1456
01:47:38,866 --> 01:47:42,892
Don't take no abuse!
This is your time, Micky!

1457
01:47:42,894 --> 01:47:44,886
It's all for you!

1458
01:47:44,900 --> 01:47:47,157

Ward trades his way back.

1461
01:47:55,274 --> 01:47:58,320
Ward nods as if to say "Come on!".

1462
01:47:58,321 --> 01:48:00,892
"Come on, let's fight!"

1463
01:48:00,913 --> 01:48:04,286
Closer and closer to Neary's ribcage.

1464
01:48:04,309 --> 01:48:06,904
This is becoming Micky Ward's fight.

1465
01:48:06,916 --> 01:48:09,546
And a left hook to the body,
and an uppercut lands,

1466
01:48:09,557 --> 01:48:12,270
and now he backs Neary up.

01:48:24,021 --> 01:48:27,643
that Shea Neary has gone down.

1471
01:48:27,651 --> 01:48:30,082
This is it! This is it, Micky!

1472
01:48:30,094 --> 01:48:35,312
23 seconds remain in this round
as Micky now wipes off Neary's gloves.

1473
01:48:37,830 --> 01:48:43,934

They grinding gutting Micky Ward
pulls out another big victory.

You're the champion of the world, Mick!
You're the fucking champion of the world!

1480
01:49:23,256 --> 01:49:25,734
You fucking did it!

1481
01:49:38,496 --> 01:49:41,514
My boy's the champion of the world!

1482
01:49:41,515 --> 01:49:43,580
I love you!

1483
01:50:13,754 --> 01:50:17,335
This town always said
you're a fucking boxer, right?

1484
01:50:17,359 --> 01:50:19,724
You thought it's a piece of shit.

1485
01:50:19,736 --> 01:50:22,061
- He put Lowell back on the map, you know.
- We did.

1486
01:50:22,072 --> 01:50:25,102
- I tell you. No, hold on.
- We.

1487
01:50:25,118 --> 01:50:28,254
Who used to be the Pride of Lowell?
Right here.

1488
01:50:28,256 --> 01:50:30,862
Who's the Pride of Lowell now?
Right there.

1489
01:50:30,863 --> 01:50:32,941
That's how it's meant to be, you know?

1490
01:50:32,947 --> 01:50:36,082
Hand it down to him.
Nothing better than that.

1491
01:50:36,094 --> 01:50:38,357
Nothing better than that...

1492
01:50:38,358 --> 01:50:40,528
He did it.
I've got to go.

1493
01:50:40,552 --> 01:50:42,113
I've got to go.
