1
00:00:29,187 --> 00:00:32,982
Berlin, Germany.

2
00:01:08,142 --> 00:01:11,271
You didnt wake me.

3
00:01:11,646 --> 00:01:13,314
You were sleeping.

4
00:01:13,481 --> 00:01:16,401
You let me sleep because you cant
bear to have breakfast with me.

5
00:01:16,568 --> 00:01:19,529
Nothing could be further from the
truth. I boiled you an egg. See?

6
00:01:19,696 --> 00:01:21,155
Id hardly have boiled you an egg
if I didnt want to see you.

7
00:01:21,322 --> 00:01:23,074
Tea or coffee?

8
00:01:23,241 --> 00:01:25,702
Does any woman ever stay long
enough to find out

9
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:28,955
What the hell
goes on in your head?

10
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:31,791
What are you doing tonight?

11
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:35,753
Im seeing my daughter.

12
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,883
Your daughter? Youve kept very
quiet about her.

13
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:43,803
Have I?
Shes been abroad for a year.

14
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,681
Did you say tea?

15
00:01:46,848 --> 00:01:49,392
Im going.

16
00:01:51,394 --> 00:01:54,939
Give my love to your daughter.

17
00:02:24,969 --> 00:02:27,805
Tickets please.

18
00:03:00,463 --> 00:03:04,551
Neustadt, West Germany, 1958

19
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,676
Hey, you!

20
00:04:13,703 --> 00:04:15,997
Your feets!

21
00:04:35,391 --> 00:04:38,061
Hey, kid.

22
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,605
Up.

23
00:04:42,232 --> 00:04:44,901
Its alright

24
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:58,456
Where do you live?

25
00:05:02,377 --> 00:05:03,378
Its here.

26
00:05:03,545 --> 00:05:07,298
Ill be fine now.
Thank you.

27
00:05:07,757 --> 00:05:10,593
Goodbye

28
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:21,187
Look after yourself.

29
00:05:25,942 --> 00:05:28,695
Im worried about him.

30
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:29,988
He looks terrible.

31
00:05:30,154 --> 00:05:32,031
The boys saying he doesnt need a doctor.

32
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:35,201
- He does.
- I dont need a doctor.

33
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:36,202
Good then.
- Peter!

34
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:37,903
Were not going to argue about this.

35
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:44,460
Remind me, how old are you now?

36
00:05:44,495 --> 00:05:46,671
Michaels fifteen.

37
00:05:46,838 --> 00:05:49,340
Its scarlet fever.

38
00:05:49,507 --> 00:05:52,719
Hell be in bed
for several months. At least.

39
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:55,221
In completely isolation.

40
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:59,434
Emily, keep away. Hes contagious.

41
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:02,478
Emily?

42
00:06:18,369 --> 00:06:21,039
How are you feeling?

43
00:06:21,206 --> 00:06:23,625
Better.

44
00:06:24,626 --> 00:06:26,503
I meant to tell you..

45
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:28,880
the day I got ill...
a woman helped me.

46
00:06:29,047 --> 00:06:30,965
She helped you?

47
00:06:31,132 --> 00:06:33,718
Yes. She brought me home.

48
00:06:33,885 --> 00:06:37,138
Do you have her address?

49
00:07:14,092 --> 00:07:16,344
Yes?

50
00:07:40,577 --> 00:07:41,995
I brought you these flowers.

51
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:44,038
To say thank you.

52
00:07:44,205 --> 00:07:47,333
Put them over there.

53
00:08:07,812 --> 00:08:10,356
I would have come earlier, but Ive
been in bed for three months.

54
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,358
Youre better now?

55
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:15,028
Yes, thank you.

56
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:16,905
Have you always been weak?

57
00:08:17,071 --> 00:08:19,991
Oh no. Id never been ill before.

58
00:08:20,158 --> 00:08:22,619
Its incredibly boring.

59
00:08:22,785 --> 00:08:25,163
Theres nothing to do.

60
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:29,083
I couldnt even be
bothered to read.

61
00:08:32,587 --> 00:08:34,964
Well, thank you again.

62
00:08:35,131 --> 00:08:37,509
Wait.

63
00:08:37,675 --> 00:08:41,846
Ill walk with you.
I have to go to work.

64
00:08:43,765 --> 00:08:48,061
Wait in the hall while I change.

65
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:41,067
There are two more buckets downstairs.
You can fill them and bring them up.

66
00:12:06,801 --> 00:12:10,722
You look ridiculous, look at you, kid.

67
00:12:13,224 --> 00:12:16,644
You cant go home like that.

68
00:12:19,522 --> 00:12:23,276
Take off your clothes.
Ill run you a bath.

69
00:12:43,588 --> 00:12:47,467
Do you always take a bath in
your trousers?

70
00:12:59,938 --> 00:13:03,733
Its all right, I wont look.

71
00:14:08,756 --> 00:14:12,010
I'll get you a towel.

72
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:15,323
Thats why you came back.

73
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:35,093
Youre so beautiful

74
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:39,013
What are you talking about?

75
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:50,984
Look at me kid.

76
00:15:53,611 --> 00:15:56,614
Slowly.
Slowly.

77
00:16:35,236 --> 00:16:37,530
Youve inconvenienced your mother.

78
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:40,450
How many more times?
Ive said Im sorry.

79
00:16:40,617 --> 00:16:43,203
You scared her.
- I got lost, thats all.

80
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:46,080
Thats why I was late.
Can I have some more?

81
00:16:46,247 --> 00:16:48,833
How can anyone get lost in their
own home town?

82
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,711
I meant to head for the castle, I
ended up at the sports-field.

83
00:16:51,753 --> 00:16:53,630
Theyre in opposite directions.
- Its none of your business.

84
00:16:53,671 --> 00:16:54,714
Hes lying.

85
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:57,050
Hes not lying.

86
00:16:57,217 --> 00:17:00,720
Michael never lies.

87
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:05,141
Dad, Ive decided, I want to go
back to school tomorrow.

88
00:17:05,308 --> 00:17:07,393
The doctor says you need another
three weeks.

89
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,103
Well Im going.

90
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,648
Peter!

91
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:56,192
Like this?

92
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:58,611
That's right!

93
00:18:03,074 --> 00:18:05,910
Not so fast.

94
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:22,260
It's alright!

95
00:18:22,427 --> 00:18:25,680
Do it again.

96
00:18:47,785 --> 00:18:50,121
What's your name?

97
00:18:50,288 --> 00:18:51,247
What?

98
00:18:51,414 --> 00:18:53,374
Your name?

99
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:56,085
Why do you want to know?

100
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:59,339
Ive been here three times.

101
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:03,551
I want to know your name.
What's wrong was that?

102
00:19:03,968 --> 00:19:06,137
Nothing, kid...

103
00:19:06,304 --> 00:19:08,681
There's nothing wrong with that.

104
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:10,391
It's Hanna.

105
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:13,811
It looks so suspicious.

106
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:16,272
Whats yours, kid?

107
00:19:16,439 --> 00:19:18,900
Michael.

108
00:19:21,611 --> 00:19:24,739
So I'm with Michael.

109
00:19:25,907 --> 00:19:27,700
Hanna.

110
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:33,289
The notion of secrecy is central to
Western literature.

111
00:19:33,456 --> 00:19:36,793
You may say the
whole idea of character

112
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,297
in fiction is defined by people holding
specific information

113
00:19:41,673 --> 00:19:49,013
which for various reasons.
- Sometimes perverse... Sometimes noble

114
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:54,894
They are determined not to disclose.

115
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:09,826
You never tell me what youve been
studying.

116
00:20:09,993 --> 00:20:12,537
Studying?

117
00:20:12,996 --> 00:20:15,999
At school.

118
00:20:18,209 --> 00:20:21,045
Do you learn languages?

119
00:20:21,212 --> 00:20:23,464
Yes.

120
00:20:23,673 --> 00:20:26,050
What languages?

121
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:28,645
Latin.

122
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:35,110
Say something in Latin.

123
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:37,362
Quo, quo scelesti ruitis? Aut cur
dexteris aptantur enses conditi?

124
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:41,283
Aut cur dexteris aptantur
enses conditi?

125
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,036
Its Horace.

126
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:46,955
Its wonderful.

127
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:50,459
Do you want some Greek?

128
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:04,431
Oi men ippeon stroton oi de pesedon
oi da naon phais epi gan malainan

129
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:08,018
emmenai kalliston, ego de ken otto
tis eratai.

130
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:10,229
Its beautiful.

131
00:21:10,386 --> 00:21:12,972
How can you tell?

132
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:17,101
How do you know
when youve no idea what it means?

133
00:21:19,854 --> 00:21:22,023
What are you studying in German?

134
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:25,026
I'm studying a play

135
00:21:25,568 --> 00:21:28,029
Well, Im writing a play.
By a writer called Gotthold Ephraim Lessing.

136
00:21:28,196 --> 00:21:29,197
Youve heard of him?

137
00:21:29,364 --> 00:21:32,075
The plays called Emilia Galotti.

138
00:21:32,242 --> 00:21:33,827
You can read it.

139
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:36,454
Id rather listen to you.

140
00:21:36,621 --> 00:21:39,040
Allright.

141
00:21:47,632 --> 00:21:50,677
Act One.
Scene One.

142
00:21:50,844 --> 00:21:53,346
The setting:
one of the princes chambers.

143
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:55,932
The Prince:

144
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:59,102
I'm not very good.

145
00:21:59,269 --> 00:22:01,688
Go On!

146
00:22:02,605 --> 00:22:06,234
"Complaints, nothing but complaints."

147
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:11,197
For goodness sake, is there anything,
live for work?"

148
00:22:11,364 --> 00:22:15,994
just imagine that people actually envy us.

149
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:19,956
Youre good at it, arent you?

150
00:22:21,332 --> 00:22:24,169
Good at what?

151
00:22:26,796 --> 00:22:29,465
Reading.

152
00:22:32,552 --> 00:22:35,471
What's funny?

153
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:40,560
I didnt think I was good
at anything.

154
00:24:06,521 --> 00:24:09,858
What are you doing?
What is it?

155
00:24:10,024 --> 00:24:12,694
Why did you treat me like if you didn't know me?

156
00:24:12,861 --> 00:24:14,404
You didnt want to know me!

157
00:24:14,571 --> 00:24:17,615
You can see I was in the first carriage.
So why did you sit in the second?

158
00:24:17,782 --> 00:24:19,367
What did you think I was doing?

159
00:24:19,534 --> 00:24:21,202
Why the hell do you think I was there?

160
00:24:21,369 --> 00:24:22,954
How should I know.
I need a bath.

161
00:24:23,121 --> 00:24:25,790
You know I've been working.

162
00:24:25,957 --> 00:24:28,543
I'd like to be by myself

163
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:31,713
Could you please, leave?

164
00:24:35,425 --> 00:24:38,928
I... I didnt mean to upset you.

165
00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:43,058
You dont have the power to upset me.

166
00:24:43,725 --> 00:24:46,363
You dont matter enough to upset me.

167
00:26:03,263 --> 00:26:06,474
I dont know what to say.

168
00:26:07,725 --> 00:26:11,271
Ive never been with a woman before.

169
00:26:13,815 --> 00:26:17,068
Weve been together four weeks

170
00:26:17,694 --> 00:26:21,364
and I cant live without you.
I cant!

171
00:26:22,198 --> 00:26:25,535
Even the thought of it kills me.

172
00:26:30,415 --> 00:26:35,378
Kid, you thought we could make love
in a tram?

173
00:26:35,545 --> 00:26:39,883
kid, myla the e that we will
kocha is the tram?

174
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:49,726
Is it true what you said?
That I dont matter to you?

175
00:27:02,155 --> 00:27:04,949
Do you forgive me?

176
00:27:10,038 --> 00:27:12,832
Do you love me?

177
00:27:29,224 --> 00:27:31,226
Do you have a book?

178
00:27:31,392 --> 00:27:32,852
Yes, I have.

179
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:36,231
I took something
with me this morning.

180
00:27:36,397 --> 00:27:38,233
What is it?

181
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:42,278
"The Odyssey" by Homer.
It's my homework.

182
00:27:44,656 --> 00:27:47,700
Were changing the order we do things.

183
00:27:47,867 --> 00:27:49,869
Read to me first, kid.

184
00:27:50,036 --> 00:27:53,706
Then we make love.

185
00:27:56,709 --> 00:27:58,419
"The Odyssey" by Homer.

186
00:27:58,586 --> 00:28:00,296
Whats an odyssey?

187
00:28:00,463 --> 00:28:02,841
Its a journey.
He sets out on a journey.

188
00:28:03,007 --> 00:28:05,385
Good.

189
00:28:08,555 --> 00:28:11,724
Sing to me of the Man, Muse, the
man of twists and turns...

190
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:14,477
Driven time and again off course,
once he had plundered

191
00:28:14,644 --> 00:28:17,564
The hallowed heights of Troy.

192
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:20,108
Come here!

193
00:28:26,281 --> 00:28:29,409
"You press your hand
to his lips."

194
00:28:29,576 --> 00:28:32,245
"She was dead"

195
00:28:32,537 --> 00:28:35,582
"Pass all hed."

196
00:28:44,007 --> 00:28:46,718
"I poked into the place aways and
encountered a little open patch

197
00:28:47,085 --> 00:28:52,015
as big as a bedroom.
All hung around with vines.

198
00:28:52,182 --> 00:28:54,559
and found a man lying there asleep,

199
00:28:54,687 --> 00:28:57,341
and by Jinks,
it was my old Jim..."

200
00:28:57,708 --> 00:29:06,088
"- When you learn it. I'll rec catch up land with shout you...

201
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:11,451
Lady Chatterley felt his naked
flesh against her as he came into

202
00:29:11,618 --> 00:29:14,579
flesh against her as he came into her.

203
00:29:14,746 --> 00:29:17,332
For a moment he was still
inside her...

204
00:29:17,499 --> 00:29:20,335
This is disgusting.

205
00:29:20,835 --> 00:29:22,879
Where did you get this?

206
00:29:23,046 --> 00:29:26,007
I borrowed it from someone at school.

207
00:29:26,174 --> 00:29:28,843
You should be ashamed.

208
00:29:31,513 --> 00:29:34,140
Go on.

209
00:29:34,307 --> 00:29:39,604
Blistering Barnacles and a
thundering typhoon. It is water.'

210
00:29:39,771 --> 00:29:41,815
But what on earth did you expect
it to be?

211
00:29:41,981 --> 00:29:43,399
Whisky.

212
00:29:43,566 --> 00:29:45,860
Whisky! By thunder, whisky.

213
00:29:46,027 --> 00:29:47,987
Whisky?

214
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:49,864
Come now captain, you
cant be serious.

215
00:29:50,031 --> 00:29:53,034
Thats enough for today, kid.

216
00:29:53,201 --> 00:29:55,995
I was wondering...
Do you think you could get some time off?

217
00:29:56,162 --> 00:29:59,123
Maybe we could go for a trip.

218
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:00,458
What sort of trip?

219
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:02,585
Bicycling holiday.

220
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:05,421
Just for two days.

221
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:11,427
Ive got a guide-book.
Ive worked out the route.

222
00:30:11,594 --> 00:30:13,638
Look!

223
00:30:13,805 --> 00:30:16,516
What do you think?

224
00:30:18,852 --> 00:30:23,231
I think you like planning, dont you?

225
00:30:37,537 --> 00:30:40,290
Im not frightened.

226
00:30:40,456 --> 00:30:43,710
Im not frightened of anything.

227
00:30:44,169 --> 00:30:48,506
The more suffering,
the more I love.

228
00:30:49,048 --> 00:30:52,260
Danger will only increase my love,

229
00:30:52,427 --> 00:30:56,097
it will sharpen it,
it will give it spice.

230
00:30:57,348 --> 00:31:00,059
Ill be the only angel you need.

231
00:31:00,226 --> 00:31:03,980
You will leave life even more beautiful
than you entered it.

232
00:31:04,147 --> 00:31:08,318
Heaven will take
you back and look at you and say

233
00:31:08,776 --> 00:31:10,987
Only one thing can make a soul
complete,

234
00:31:11,154 --> 00:31:12,405
and that thing is love.

235
00:31:48,942 --> 00:31:51,444
Excuse me.

236
00:31:51,611 --> 00:31:54,989
Do you know what would you like?

237
00:31:57,575 --> 00:31:59,911
What are you having?

238
00:32:00,078 --> 00:32:03,456
You order.
Ill have what you have.

239
00:32:05,542 --> 00:32:09,170

Thank you.

241
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,810
I hope your mother was happy.

242
00:32:23,977 --> 00:32:24,686
Thank you.

243
00:32:24,853 --> 00:32:28,523
She enjoyed her meal very much.

244
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:03,808
Here, let me show you where were going.

245
00:33:03,975 --> 00:33:07,228
Its OK, kid.

246
00:33:07,687 --> 00:33:10,773
I dont want to know.

247
00:34:59,799 --> 00:35:03,094
- What are you doing?
- Im writing a poem. About you.

248
00:35:03,261 --> 00:35:05,722
About you.

249
00:35:06,973 --> 00:35:08,683
Can I hear it?

250
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:10,602
Its not ready.

251
00:35:10,768 --> 00:35:14,272
Ill read it to you one day.

252
00:36:28,763 --> 00:36:31,307

259
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:57,000
The defender, please!

- Hello.

261
00:37:18,855 --> 00:37:20,273
Good morning, ladies.

262
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,525
Gentlemen, please welcome your 
new fellow-students,

00:37:22,692 --> 00:37:24,986

Sit down!

264
00:37:25,153 --> 00:37:27,697
Hello!

265
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,241
My name is Sophie.

266
00:37:30,408 --> 00:37:32,785
Im Michael.

267
00:37:32,952 --> 00:37:34,746
"The Odyssey"

268
00:37:34,913 --> 00:37:37,999
Take off your books.

269
00:37:39,876 --> 00:37:42,587
Everyone believes that Homers
subject is homecoming. In fact,

270
00:37:42,754 --> 00:37:45,423
The Odyssey is a book about a journey.

271
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:48,801
Home is a place you dream of...

272
00:37:48,968 --> 00:37:50,845
Berg, I dont mean to distract you,

273
00:37:51,012 --> 00:37:55,391
but were meant to studying Homer,
not studying Sophia.

274
00:38:01,439 --> 00:38:03,066
Its wonderful, isnt it?

275
00:38:03,233 --> 00:38:07,153
Wonderful.
Its going to be a great summer.

276
00:38:19,415 --> 00:38:21,042
Why do you leave early?

277
00:38:21,209 --> 00:38:22,669
He always leaves early.

278
00:38:22,836 --> 00:38:24,379
Do you have large for a job?

279
00:38:24,546 --> 00:38:27,090
See you tomorrow.

280
00:38:34,848 --> 00:38:38,393
Im sorry Im late.

281
00:38:38,601 --> 00:38:41,771
I was held up at school.

282
00:38:41,938 --> 00:38:44,816
I have a new book.

283
00:38:44,983 --> 00:38:47,986
"The Lady with the Little Dog."

284
00:38:50,196 --> 00:38:52,115
By Anton Chekhov.

285
00:38:52,282 --> 00:38:55,535
The talk was that a new face had
appeared on the promenade,

286
00:38:55,702 --> 00:38:58,788
a lady with a little dog.

287
00:39:09,424 --> 00:39:12,510
Schmitz!
One moment, please!

288
00:39:13,636 --> 00:39:16,347
I read the reports on you

289
00:39:16,514 --> 00:39:18,224
Every single word.
Excelent!

290
00:39:18,391 --> 00:39:20,560
To work with me in the office.

291
00:39:20,727 --> 00:39:22,187
Were going to promote you.

292
00:39:22,353 --> 00:39:24,939
Congratulations.

293
00:39:34,908 --> 00:39:37,327
Let's get out of here...

294
00:39:37,494 --> 00:39:40,830
Come on! Michael, We're leaving.
Let's Go!

295
00:39:41,873 --> 00:39:45,960
This is a surprise to
your birthday.

296
00:39:48,671 --> 00:39:50,882
What is it?

297
00:39:51,049 --> 00:39:52,383
I'm sorry, really...

298
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:54,219
We thought youd like it.

299
00:39:54,385 --> 00:39:57,263
We have a beer, will dances.

300
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:59,842
I promised someone.

301
00:40:00,192 --> 00:40:01,923
Michael? Please!

302
00:40:07,023 --> 00:40:11,903
"Here and there the reflection of stars
and the lights..."

303
00:40:13,404 --> 00:40:14,614
Oh kid, kid. Stop.

304
00:40:14,781 --> 00:40:15,490
What?

305
00:40:15,657 --> 00:40:16,783
Stop.

306
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:19,494
Whats wrong now?

307
00:40:19,661 --> 00:40:21,913
Nothings wrong.

308
00:40:23,957 --> 00:40:26,209
Its nothing.

309
00:40:27,252 --> 00:40:29,003
You know?

310
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:31,089
You never ask,

311
00:40:31,256 --> 00:40:34,801
You never bother to
ask how I am.

312
00:40:34,968 --> 00:40:37,220
You never say.

313
00:40:37,387 --> 00:40:40,807
It just happens to be my birthday.

314
00:40:41,432 --> 00:40:44,102
Its my birthday, thats all.

315
00:40:44,269 --> 00:40:46,020
In fact, youve never even asked when it is.

316
00:40:46,187 --> 00:40:47,313
Look if you want a fight, kid?...

317
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,773
No, I dont want a fight.

318
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:49,816
Whats wrong with you?

319
00:40:49,983 --> 00:40:52,861
What business is it of yours?

320
00:40:53,027 --> 00:40:56,072
Its always on your terms.
Everything!

321
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:57,740
We do what you want.

322
00:40:57,907 --> 00:41:00,118
Its always what you want.
My friends were giving me a party!

323
00:41:00,285 --> 00:41:02,120
Well then why are you here?

324
00:41:02,287 --> 00:41:05,957
Go back to your party.
Isnt that what you want?

325
00:41:30,899 --> 00:41:32,817
And its always me that has to apologize.

326
00:41:32,984 --> 00:41:35,069
You dont have to apologize.

327
00:41:35,236 --> 00:41:38,072
No-one
has to apologize.

328
00:41:45,788 --> 00:41:49,334
War and Peace, kid.

329
00:43:32,896 --> 00:43:36,774
Now you must go back to your friends.

330
00:43:51,289 --> 00:43:54,501
Michael. You all right?

331
00:45:23,673 --> 00:45:26,050
It's him

332
00:45:28,761 --> 00:45:30,722
Good.

333
00:45:30,889 --> 00:45:35,059
Get the boy something to eat.

334
00:45:42,192 --> 00:45:46,779
I think we all knew youd come back
to us eventually.

335
00:46:55,098 --> 00:46:59,269
Mr Berg. It is eight oclock.
Your daughter.

336
00:47:02,939 --> 00:47:05,483
Thank you.

337
00:47:07,819 --> 00:47:10,196
Julia.

338
00:47:11,906 --> 00:47:13,700
I'll not kept you waiting

339
00:47:13,867 --> 00:47:15,660
I was early.

340
00:47:15,827 --> 00:47:18,830
Welcome back.

341
00:47:21,166 --> 00:47:23,793
So how will you decide?

342
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,295
I dont know.

343
00:47:25,461 --> 00:47:27,463
Im happy back in Berlin, I suppose.

344
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:29,966
Youve seen your mother?

345
00:47:30,133 --> 00:47:32,677
I wanted to get away, that's all

346
00:47:32,844 --> 00:47:35,388
It was Paris,
but it could have been anywhere.

347
00:47:35,555 --> 00:47:38,641
Away from your parents?

348
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:43,688
Im aware I was difficult.

349
00:47:43,938 --> 00:47:48,234
I wasnt
always open with you.

350
00:47:49,152 --> 00:47:52,697
Im not open with anyone.

351
00:47:58,077 --> 00:48:01,164
I knew you were distant.

352
00:48:01,331 --> 00:48:06,211
You know?
Id always assumed it was my fault.

353
00:48:07,545 --> 00:48:09,923
Julia.

354
00:48:10,632 --> 00:48:13,968
How wrong can you be?

355
00:48:24,103 --> 00:48:28,191
- See you soon.
- Ill see you soon.

356
00:48:30,068 --> 00:48:33,863

we seem to be quite a small group.

361
00:49:23,454 --> 00:49:26,708
A small group and a select one.

362
00:49:26,875 --> 00:49:31,087
Clearly, this is going to be a
unique seminar.

363
00:49:31,337 --> 00:49:34,883

364
00:49:35,175 --> 00:49:38,845

00:49:58,448 --> 00:50:01,409
So this is where you are.

367
00:50:04,245 --> 00:50:06,623
Yes.
Come in.

368
00:50:08,082 --> 00:50:10,793
You take work seriously.

369
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,212
Oh I dont know.

370
00:50:12,378 --> 00:50:14,631
Youre rather a serious boy.

371
00:50:14,797 --> 00:50:16,925
Its how I was brought up.

372
00:50:17,091 --> 00:50:19,385
What about you?

373
00:50:20,303 --> 00:50:23,431
Are you serious?

374
00:50:24,474 --> 00:50:28,269
Youre sure you want to work tonight?

375
00:50:31,105 --> 00:50:33,650
But I wont work every night.

376
00:50:33,817 --> 00:50:36,361
See you tomorrow.

377
00:50:49,541 --> 00:50:52,502
We need help.

378
00:51:15,859 --> 00:51:17,360
Why all the police?

379
00:51:17,527 --> 00:51:20,280
Theyre worried about demonstrators.

380
00:51:20,446 --> 00:51:22,157
For or against?

381
00:51:22,323 --> 00:51:25,410
both.

382
00:51:29,122 --> 00:51:31,833
Is a circus.

383
00:51:37,714 --> 00:51:41,634
All photographers are now asked to leave.

384
00:51:41,801 --> 00:51:43,803
The defendants, please..

385
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:46,806
Please sit down!

386
00:51:48,016 --> 00:51:52,729
The first thing Im going to do is hear motions
from each of the defendants lawyers.

387
00:51:52,896 --> 00:51:55,064
Theyre going to be arguing that
theres no reason

388
00:51:55,231 --> 00:52:00,487
to keep the defendants in jail until the
outcome of the forthcoming trial.

389
00:52:00,987 --> 00:52:02,280
Do you want a pen?

390
00:52:02,447 --> 00:52:03,865
Ive got a pen.

391
00:52:04,032 --> 00:52:05,325
Hanna Schmitz.

392
00:52:05,492 --> 00:52:09,120
Your name is Hanna Schmitz?

393
00:52:09,287 --> 00:52:11,164
Yes.

394
00:52:11,331 --> 00:52:13,416
Can you speak louder please?

395
00:52:13,583 --> 00:52:14,918
My name is Hanna Schmitz.

396
00:52:15,084 --> 00:52:16,628
Thank you.

397
00:52:16,794 --> 00:52:20,381
You were born on October 21st, 1922?

398
00:52:20,548 --> 00:52:22,550
Yes.

399
00:52:22,717 --> 00:52:26,137
At Hermannstadt.
And youre now 43 years old?

400
00:52:27,305 --> 00:52:28,848
Yes.

401
00:52:29,015 --> 00:52:32,811
You joined the SS in 1943?

402
00:52:33,019 --> 00:52:34,145
Yes.

403
00:52:34,312 --> 00:52:37,315
What was your reason for joining?

404
00:52:38,441 --> 00:52:40,902
You were working at the Siemens
factory at the time?

405
00:52:41,069 --> 00:52:41,986
Yes.

406
00:52:42,153 --> 00:52:45,490
Youd recently been offered a promotion.

407
00:52:45,657 --> 00:52:47,450
Why did you prefer to join the SS?

408
00:52:47,617 --> 00:52:48,368
Objection

409
00:52:48,535 --> 00:52:50,453
Ill re-phrase my question.

410
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:55,917
Im trying to ascertain if she joined the SS freely.

411
00:52:56,251 --> 00:52:59,420
Of her own free will.

412
00:52:59,587 --> 00:53:01,756
I heard there were jobs

413
00:53:01,923 --> 00:53:03,424
Go on...

414
00:53:03,591 --> 00:53:08,930
I was working at Siemens when I
heard the SS was recruitin

415
00:53:09,097 --> 00:53:13,143
Did you know the kind of work youd
be expected to do?

416
00:53:13,309 --> 00:53:16,521
They were looking for guards.

417
00:53:16,938 --> 00:53:19,023
I applied for a job.

418
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:21,359
And you worked first at Auschwitz?

419
00:53:21,526 --> 00:53:22,527
Yes.

420
00:53:22,694 --> 00:53:28,491
Until 1944. Then you were moved to
a smaller camp near Cracow?

421
00:53:29,492 --> 00:53:32,495
- Yes.
- Are you OK?

422
00:53:32,662 --> 00:53:33,496
Im fine.

423
00:53:33,663 --> 00:53:39,460
... You then helped move the prisoners west
in the winter of 1944 in the so-called death marches?

424
00:53:58,771 --> 00:54:02,400
- So what did you think?
- I do not know.

425
00:54:03,193 --> 00:54:05,612
It wasnt quite what I expecting.

426
00:54:05,778 --> 00:54:06,946
Wasnt it?

427
00:54:07,113 --> 00:54:08,490
In what way?

428
00:54:08,656 --> 00:54:10,825
What were you expecting?

429
00:54:10,992 --> 00:54:12,702
I thought it was exciting.

430
00:54:12,869 --> 00:54:14,329
Exciting?

431
00:54:14,496 --> 00:54:17,207
Why? Why did you think it exciting?

432
00:54:17,373 --> 00:54:21,169
Because its justice.

433
00:54:48,613 --> 00:54:53,701
Societies think they operate by
something called morality

434
00:54:53,868 --> 00:54:55,245
But they dont.

435
00:54:55,411 --> 00:54:59,332
They operate by something called law.

436
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:04,712
Youre not guilty of anything merely
by working at Auschwitz.

437
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:09,676
8,000 people worked at Auschwitz.

438
00:55:09,843 --> 00:55:14,222
Precisely 19 have been
convicted, and only 6 for murder.

439
00:55:14,848 --> 00:55:19,561
To prove murder you have to prove intent.

440
00:55:19,727 --> 00:55:21,855
Thats the law.

441
00:55:22,021 --> 00:55:26,234
The question is never Was it wrong?

442
00:55:26,401 --> 00:55:28,194
but Was it legal?

443
00:55:28,361 --> 00:55:32,407
And not by our laws.
No.

444
00:55:33,283 --> 00:55:34,993
by the laws at the time.
with the law of the times.

445
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:36,744
But isnt that...

446
00:55:36,911 --> 00:55:38,997
What?

447
00:55:39,164 --> 00:55:40,338
Narrow?

448
00:55:40,373 --> 00:55:43,877
Oh, Yes. The law is narrow.

449
00:55:44,669 --> 00:55:47,922
On the other hand, I suspect people

450
00:55:48,089 --> 00:55:50,008
who kill other people

451
00:55:50,175 --> 00:55:53,970
tend to be aware that its wrong.

452
00:55:55,305 --> 00:55:59,350
Miss Schmitz, youre familiar with this book..

453
00:56:01,728 --> 00:56:03,104
Yes.

454
00:56:03,271 --> 00:56:06,733
Parts of it have already been read
out in court.

455
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:09,194
Its by a survivor,

456
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:11,029
a prisoner who survived

457
00:56:11,196 --> 00:56:13,781
Ilana Mather...

458
00:56:13,948 --> 00:56:16,576
She was in the camp, wasnt she,
when she was a child?

459
00:56:16,743 --> 00:56:18,244
She was with her mother.

460
00:56:18,411 --> 00:56:20,163
Yes.

461
00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:24,375
In the book, she describes a
selection process.

462
00:56:24,876 --> 00:56:28,755
At the end of the months labour, every month,
sixty inmates were selected.

463
00:56:28,922 --> 00:56:33,009
They were picked out to be sent from the
satellite camp back to Auschwitz.

464
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:36,638
Thats right, isnt it?

465
00:56:36,805 --> 00:56:39,390
Yes.
Its right.

466
00:56:39,557 --> 00:56:42,811
And so far, each of your fellow defendants

467
00:56:42,977 --> 00:56:46,856
has specifically denied
being part of that process.

468
00:56:47,023 --> 00:56:49,359
Now Im going to ask you.

469
00:56:49,526 --> 00:56:52,946
Were you part of it?

470
00:56:53,488 --> 00:56:55,740
Yes.

471
00:56:58,409 --> 00:57:01,913
So you helped make the selection?

472
00:57:02,747 --> 00:57:03,832
Yes.

473
00:57:03,998 --> 00:57:07,085
You admit that?

474
00:57:10,421 --> 00:57:12,006
Then...

475
00:57:12,173 --> 00:57:16,636
tell me, how did that selection happen?

476
00:57:16,803 --> 00:57:18,888
There were six guards,

477
00:57:19,055 --> 00:57:23,518
So we decided wed choose ten people each.

478
00:57:25,228 --> 00:57:27,856
Thats how we did it - every month.

479
00:57:28,022 --> 00:57:30,275
Wed all choose 10.

480
00:57:30,441 --> 00:57:33,403
Are you saying your fellow
defendants took part in the process?

481
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:36,072
We all did.

482
00:57:36,239 --> 00:57:38,700
Even though theyve denied it?

483
00:57:38,867 --> 00:57:41,244
Youre saying you
took part in the process.

484
00:57:41,411 --> 00:57:45,206
than the "I", true
Ms Schmitz?

485
00:57:45,832 --> 00:57:48,001
Did you not realise...

486
00:57:48,168 --> 00:57:51,796
you were sending these women to their deaths?

487
00:57:51,963 --> 00:57:52,589
Yes, but...

488
00:57:52,755 --> 00:57:56,676
there were new arrivals,
new women were arriving all the time. So...

489
00:57:56,843 --> 00:58:01,055
of course we had to move
some of the old ones on.

490
00:58:01,222 --> 00:58:02,974
Im not sure you understand...

491
00:58:03,141 --> 00:58:04,601
We couldnt keep everyone.

492
00:58:04,767 --> 00:58:07,770
There wasnt room.

493
00:58:07,979 --> 00:58:10,982
No, but what Im saying

494
00:58:11,149 --> 00:58:13,359
let me rephrase: to make room,

495
00:58:13,526 --> 00:58:15,778
you were picking women out and saying

496
00:58:15,945 --> 00:58:20,658
You you and you have to be sent back to be killed?

497
00:58:22,368 --> 00:58:25,497
Well, what would you have done?

498
00:58:34,214 --> 00:58:38,927
Should I never have signed up at Siemens?

499
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:52,816
Ms. Mather, theyre ready for you now.

500
00:58:54,526 --> 00:58:57,779
Go! Go! Go! Go!

501
00:59:09,123 --> 00:59:13,086
- Where's Michael?
- I do not know.

502
00:59:13,294 --> 00:59:17,549
In your book you describe the
process of selection...

503
00:59:17,715 --> 00:59:19,217
Yes.

504
00:59:19,384 --> 00:59:21,261
You were made to work and then,

505
00:59:21,427 --> 00:59:24,097
when you were no longer any
use to them,

506
00:59:24,264 --> 00:59:26,724
then they sent you
back to Auschwitz to be killed.

507
00:59:26,891 --> 00:59:29,769
Are there people here today who
made that selection?

508
00:59:29,936 --> 00:59:31,646
Yes.

509
00:59:31,813 --> 00:59:34,566
I need you to identify them

510
00:59:34,732 --> 00:59:37,986
Can you please point them out?

511
00:59:50,165 --> 00:59:52,417
Her

512
00:59:55,295 --> 00:59:57,672
And her.

513
00:59:59,132 --> 01:00:01,384
And her.

514
01:00:03,261 --> 01:00:05,638
And her.

515
01:00:06,764 --> 01:00:09,017
her.

516
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:13,438
And her.

517
01:00:13,938 --> 01:00:16,941
Thank You!
Please continue.

518
01:00:17,108 --> 01:00:20,778
Each of the guards would choose a
certain number of women.

519
01:00:20,945 --> 01:00:23,698
Hanna Schmitz chose differently.

520
01:00:23,865 --> 01:00:26,451
In what way differently?

521
01:00:30,413 --> 01:00:35,543
She had favourites.
Girls, mostly young.

522
01:00:36,419 --> 01:00:39,088
We all remarked on it,

523
01:00:39,255 --> 01:00:42,091
she gave them food and places to sleep.

524
01:00:42,258 --> 01:00:46,429
In the evening,
she asked them to join her.

525
01:00:46,805 --> 01:00:48,723
We all thought

526
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:51,469
Well, you can imagine what we thought

527
01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:52,770
And then we found out...

528
01:00:52,812 --> 01:00:57,942
...she was making these women read aloud to her.

529
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:03,030
They were reading to her.

530
01:01:03,239 --> 01:01:05,700
At first we thought this guard, this guard is...

531
01:01:05,866 --> 01:01:09,245
more sensitive,

532
01:01:09,412 --> 01:01:11,205
she's more human,

533
01:01:11,372 --> 01:01:12,915
she's kinder.

534
01:01:13,082 --> 01:01:17,545
Often she chose the
weak, the sick,

535
01:01:18,546 --> 01:01:22,008
she picked them out,
she seemed to be protecting them almost.

536
01:01:22,174 --> 01:01:25,678
But then she dispatched them.

537
01:01:27,179 --> 01:01:30,016
Is that kinder?

538
01:01:38,649 --> 01:01:42,111
I want to move on now to the march.

539
01:01:42,278 --> 01:01:45,656
As I understand it, you and your
daughter were marched for many months.

540
01:01:45,823 --> 01:01:49,744
Yes. It was the winter of 1944.
Our camp was closed down,

541
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:51,871
we were told we had to move on.

542
01:01:52,038 --> 01:01:54,665
But the plan kept changing every day.

543
01:01:54,832 --> 01:01:58,753
Women were dying all around us in the snow.

544
01:01:58,961 --> 01:02:01,213
Half of us died on the march.

545
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:03,549
My daughter says in the book,

546
01:02:03,716 --> 01:02:08,054
less a death march, more a death gallop.

547
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:12,433
Please tell us about the night in the church.

548
01:02:20,441 --> 01:02:22,485
That night we actually thought we were lucky

549
01:02:22,652 --> 01:02:24,737
because we had a roof
over our heads.

550
01:02:24,904 --> 01:02:27,698
Go on!

551
01:02:28,324 --> 01:02:32,995
Wed arrived in a village, as always,
the guards took the best quarters,

552
01:02:33,162 --> 01:02:35,748
they took the priests house.

553
01:02:35,915 --> 01:02:39,043
But they let us sleep in a church.

554
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:42,213
There was a bombing raid.
In the middle of the night.

555
01:02:43,422 --> 01:02:46,759
The Church was sit.

556
01:02:46,926 --> 01:02:51,097
At first we could only hear
the fire, it was in the steeple.

557
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:56,310
Then we could see burning beams,

558
01:02:56,936 --> 01:03:00,815
and they began to crash to the floor.

559
01:03:01,774 --> 01:03:05,152
Everyone rushed,

560
01:03:06,362 --> 01:03:09,615
rushed to the doors.

561
01:03:10,741 --> 01:03:13,661
But the doors had been
locked on the outside.

562
01:03:13,828 --> 01:03:15,413
The church burned down?

563
01:03:15,579 --> 01:03:20,293
Nobody came to open the doors?
Is that right?

564
01:03:22,003 --> 01:03:23,546
Nobody.

565
01:03:23,713 --> 01:03:28,759
Even though you were all burning to death?

566
01:03:30,886 --> 01:03:33,723
How many people were killed?

567
01:03:33,889 --> 01:03:36,976
Everyone was killed.

568
01:03:37,852 --> 01:03:40,813
But you survived?

569
01:03:48,070 --> 01:03:50,906
Thank you.

570
01:03:51,699 --> 01:03:55,494
I want to thank you for
coming to this country

571
01:03:55,661 --> 01:03:58,372
today to testify.

572
01:04:01,626 --> 01:04:05,171
I dont know. I dont know what
were doing any more.

573
01:04:07,548 --> 01:04:08,633
Dont you?

574
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:10,509
You keep telling us to think like lawyers,

575
01:04:10,676 --> 01:04:14,472
but theres something
disgusting about this.

576
01:04:14,930 --> 01:04:15,806
How so?

577
01:04:15,973 --> 01:04:20,019
This didnt happen to the Germans.
It happened to the Jews.

578
01:04:20,186 --> 01:04:21,771
What are we trying to do?

579
01:04:21,938 --> 01:04:23,731
Were trying to understand.

580
01:04:23,898 --> 01:04:25,691
Six women locked three hundred Jews
in a church,

581
01:04:25,858 --> 01:04:26,692
and let them burn.

582
01:04:26,859 --> 01:04:30,237
What is there to understand?

583
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:32,657
Tell me, Im asking:

584
01:04:32,823 --> 01:04:36,035
what is there to understand?

585
01:04:38,371 --> 01:04:41,582
I started out believing in this trial.
I thought it was great.

586
01:04:41,749 --> 01:04:44,961
Now I think its just a diversion.

587
01:04:45,127 --> 01:04:47,838
Yes?
Diversion from what?

588
01:04:48,005 --> 01:04:50,383
You choose six women,
You put them on trial,

589
01:04:50,549 --> 01:04:53,803
You say They were the
evil ones, they were the guilty ones.

590
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:55,471
Because one of the victims happened

591
01:04:55,638 --> 01:04:57,014
to write a book!

592
01:04:57,181 --> 01:04:59,976
Thats why theyre
on trial and nobody else.

593
01:05:00,142 --> 01:05:03,396
Do you know how many camps
there were in Europe?

594
01:05:03,562 --> 01:05:06,232
People go on about how much did
everyone know?

595
01:05:06,399 --> 01:05:08,567
Who knew?
What did they know?

596
01:05:08,734 --> 01:05:11,279
Everyone knew.
Our Parents, Our teachers.

597
01:05:11,445 --> 01:05:13,281
That isnt the question.

598
01:05:13,447 --> 01:05:16,742
The question is
How could you let it happen?

599
01:05:16,909 --> 01:05:22,373
And - better - Why didnt you kill
yourself when you found out?

600
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:26,460
Thousands! Thats how many.
There were thousands of camps.

601
01:05:26,627 --> 01:05:29,880
Everyone knew.

602
01:05:36,387 --> 01:05:39,390
Look at that woman...

603
01:05:39,807 --> 01:05:40,725
Which woman?

604
01:05:40,891 --> 01:05:43,436
The woman youre always staring at.

605
01:05:43,603 --> 01:05:46,188
Im sorry but you are.

606
01:05:54,363 --> 01:05:57,074
I dont know which woman you mean.

607
01:05:57,241 --> 01:06:00,494
You know what Id do?

608
01:06:01,704 --> 01:06:03,914
Put the gun in my hand,

609
01:06:04,081 --> 01:06:07,043
Id shoot her myself.

610
01:06:08,794 --> 01:06:11,380
Shoot then All.

611
01:09:06,055 --> 01:09:10,101
Why did you not unlock the doors?

612
01:09:10,768 --> 01:09:14,814
Why did you not unlock the doors?

613
01:09:16,357 --> 01:09:20,653
Ive asked all of you and Im
getting no answer.

614
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:25,992
Two of the victims are in this court.
They deserve an answer.

615
01:09:28,119 --> 01:09:31,956
Here, this is the SS report.
You all have copies.

616
01:09:32,123 --> 01:09:34,917
This is the report which was
written, approved and signed by all

617
01:09:35,084 --> 01:09:37,712
of you immediately after the event.

618
01:09:37,878 --> 01:09:43,175
In the written report, you all
claim you didnt even know about
the fire until after it happened.

619
01:09:45,303 --> 01:09:48,389
But that isnt true, is it?

620
01:09:51,225 --> 01:09:54,020
Well? It isnt true.

621
01:09:56,606 --> 01:09:58,482
I dont know what youre asking.

622
01:09:58,649 --> 01:10:02,194
The first thing Im asking is,
why didnt you unlock the doors?

623
01:10:02,361 --> 01:10:05,615
Obviously. For the obvious reason.

624
01:10:07,491 --> 01:10:10,161
- We couldnt.
- Why couldnt you?

625
01:10:10,328 --> 01:10:12,705
We were guards.

626
01:10:12,872 --> 01:10:16,083
Our job was to guard the prisoners.

627
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:18,628
We couldnt just let them escape.

628
01:10:18,794 --> 01:10:20,046
I see.

629
01:10:20,212 --> 01:10:23,132
And if they escaped, then
youd be blamed, youd be charged,

630
01:10:23,299 --> 01:10:25,009
you might even be executed?

631
01:10:25,176 --> 01:10:27,053
Well then?

632
01:10:27,219 --> 01:10:30,431
If we opened the doors, then there
would have been chaos.

633
01:10:30,598 --> 01:10:33,100
How could we have restored order?

634
01:10:33,267 --> 01:10:35,019
It happened so fast. It was snowing.

635
01:10:35,186 --> 01:10:39,106
The bombs - There were
flames all over the village.

636
01:10:39,273 --> 01:10:42,652
Then the screaming began.
It got worse and worse.

637
01:10:42,818 --> 01:10:45,613
And if theyd all come rushing out,
we couldnt just let them escape.

638
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:47,573
We couldnt.

639
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:51,077
We were responsible for them.

640
01:10:53,371 --> 01:10:55,998
So you did know what was happening?

641
01:10:56,165 --> 01:10:58,417
You did know? You made a choice.

642
01:10:58,584 --> 01:11:00,544
You let them die

643
01:11:00,711 --> 01:11:04,507
rather than risk letting them escape.

644
01:11:05,675 --> 01:11:09,720
The other defendants have made an
allegation against you.

645
01:11:09,887 --> 01:11:11,847
Have you heard this allegation?

646
01:11:12,014 --> 01:11:15,351
They say you were in charge.

647
01:11:15,518 --> 01:11:17,270
It isnt true.
I was just one of the guards.

648
01:11:17,436 --> 01:11:18,562
She was in charge

649
01:11:18,729 --> 01:11:19,647
She was!

650
01:11:19,814 --> 01:11:21,691
It was her idea.

651
01:11:21,857 --> 01:11:22,441
Of course she was.

652
01:11:22,608 --> 01:11:23,734
Did you write the report?

653
01:11:23,901 --> 01:11:24,694
No. No.

654
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:26,445
We all discussed what to say.

655
01:11:26,612 --> 01:11:28,656
We all wrote it together.

656
01:11:28,823 --> 01:11:31,534
She wrote it!
She wrote the report!

657
01:11:32,119 --> 01:11:32,535
Is that true?

658
01:11:32,570 --> 01:11:32,952
Yes you did!

659
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:33,911
Does it matter who did?

660
01:11:34,078 --> 01:11:35,204
She wrote it!

661
01:11:35,371 --> 01:11:39,000
I need to see a sample of your handwriting.

662
01:11:39,166 --> 01:11:41,502
My handwriting?

663
01:11:41,669 --> 01:11:43,796
Yes.
I need to establish who wrote the report.

664
01:11:43,963 --> 01:11:46,340
Im sorry, but I really dont see how thats appropriate.
Nearly 20 years have gone by.

665
01:11:46,507 --> 01:11:47,925
Take her this piece of paper.
Counsel, approach the bench.

666
01:11:48,092 --> 01:11:50,052
Are you really going to compare

667
01:11:50,136 --> 01:11:51,262
handwriting of twenty years ago,
with handwriting of today?

668
01:11:51,304 --> 01:11:54,724
Counsel, approach the bench.

669
01:12:32,094 --> 01:12:35,056
There is no need.

670
01:12:37,892 --> 01:12:41,270
I wrote the report.

671
01:12:54,325 --> 01:12:56,994
Silence, please.

672
01:12:57,161 --> 01:12:59,580
Order.

673
01:13:11,217 --> 01:13:14,470
Youve been skipping seminars.

674
01:13:36,909 --> 01:13:39,745
I have a piece of information.

675
01:13:39,912 --> 01:13:42,707
Concerning one of the defendants.

676
01:13:42,873 --> 01:13:44,834
Something theyre not admitting.

677
01:13:45,001 --> 01:13:47,962
What information?

678
01:13:54,593 --> 01:13:58,848
You dont need me to tell you.
Its perfectly clear

679
01:13:59,015 --> 01:14:01,434
you have a moral
obligation to disclose it to the court.

680
01:14:01,601 --> 01:14:05,605
It happens this information is
favourable to the defendant.

681
01:14:05,771 --> 01:14:09,692
It can help her case.
It may even affect the outcome,

682
01:14:10,401 --> 01:14:12,278
certainly the sentencing.

683
01:14:12,445 --> 01:14:13,988
So?

684
01:14:14,155 --> 01:14:16,532
Theres a problem.

685
01:14:16,699 --> 01:14:21,537
The defendant herself is determined
to keep this information secret.

686
01:14:24,081 --> 01:14:27,293
A moment, please.

687
01:14:34,508 --> 01:14:37,511
What are her reasons?

688
01:14:39,555 --> 01:14:42,475
Because shes ashamed.

689
01:14:42,850 --> 01:14:45,937
Ashamed of what?

690
01:14:50,399 --> 01:14:54,236
Have you spoken to her?
- Of course not.

691
01:14:54,403 --> 01:14:57,740
Why "of course not"?

692
01:14:58,032 --> 01:15:00,660
I cant.

693
01:15:00,826 --> 01:15:03,537
I cant do that.

694
01:15:03,704 --> 01:15:06,415
I cant talk to her.

695
01:15:06,582 --> 01:15:10,211
What we feel isnt important. Its
utterly unimportant.

696
01:15:10,378 --> 01:15:13,798
The only question is what we do.

697
01:15:14,924 --> 01:15:18,177
If people like you dont learn from

698
01:15:18,344 --> 01:15:20,554
what happened to people like me,

699
01:15:20,721 --> 01:15:25,226
then what the hell is the point of anything?

700
01:15:31,899 --> 01:15:33,734
Schmitz!

701
01:15:33,901 --> 01:15:36,612
You have a visitor.

702
01:15:49,083 --> 01:15:52,044
Quiet Please!

703
01:16:01,887 --> 01:16:04,682
Michael Berg!

704
01:17:43,698 --> 01:17:46,367
Times up.

705
01:18:05,052 --> 01:18:07,888
Are you came in?

706
01:18:16,772 --> 01:18:19,900
Youve taken your time.

707
01:18:40,921 --> 01:18:43,633
What is it?

708
01:19:04,487 --> 01:19:07,323
Where you're going?

709
01:19:07,865 --> 01:19:10,534
Im sorry.

710
01:19:10,743 --> 01:19:13,579
I need to sleep by myself.

711
01:20:29,447 --> 01:20:30,281
Nazi

712
01:20:30,448 --> 01:20:33,534
Nazi

713
01:20:42,710 --> 01:20:45,087
Silence in the court!

714
01:20:47,673 --> 01:20:50,509
All rise!

715
01:20:56,265 --> 01:20:59,226
The court finds guilty the
defendants Rita Beckhart,

716
01:20:59,393 --> 01:21:02,480
Karolina Steinhof, Regina Kreutz,

717
01:21:02,647 --> 01:21:06,442
Angela Zieber, Andrea Luhmann

718
01:21:06,776 --> 01:21:11,238
jointly aiding and abetting murder in three
hundred cases.

719
01:21:11,530 --> 01:21:15,326
The court finds the defendant
Hanna Schmitz

720
01:21:16,494 --> 01:21:19,413
of murder in three hundred cases.

721
01:21:23,584 --> 01:21:26,003
The court sentences the accused as follows.

722
01:21:26,170 --> 01:21:30,132
Beckhart Rita, Karolina Steinhof,

723
01:21:30,424 --> 01:21:33,594
Regina Kreutz, Angela Zieber
and Andrea Luhmann

724
01:21:33,761 --> 01:21:38,099
you will each serve a total sentence in
prison of four years and three months.

725
01:21:39,809 --> 01:21:42,228
Hanna Schmitz,

726
01:21:42,395 --> 01:21:46,190
in view of your own
admissions and your special role,

727
01:21:46,357 --> 01:21:49,318
you are in a different category.

728
01:21:49,485 --> 01:21:52,488
The court sentences the accused
Schmitz to imprisonment for life.

729
01:22:27,106 --> 01:22:29,108
Where are we going?

730
01:22:29,275 --> 01:22:32,069
I said: Ill tell you when we get there.

731
01:22:32,236 --> 01:22:33,904
You told me you liked surprises.

732
01:22:34,071 --> 01:22:37,283
I like surprises.

733
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:57,720
Shes grown, hasnt she?

734
01:22:58,721 --> 01:23:02,767
I dont know. Its so long since I
saw her, Michael, how can I tell?

735
01:23:04,268 --> 01:23:06,812
Is my fault.

736
01:23:06,979 --> 01:23:09,315
We shouldnt have come unannounced.

737
01:23:09,482 --> 01:23:12,985
Daddys going to live in his own house.

738
01:23:15,321 --> 01:23:18,449
Mother, Im afraid Ive have some bad news.

739
01:23:18,616 --> 01:23:21,452
Julia knows.
Weve already told her.

740
01:23:21,744 --> 01:23:24,330
Gertrud and I are getting a divorce.

741
01:23:24,497 --> 01:23:29,377
You didnt come for your fathers
funeral, but you come for this?

742
01:23:30,503 --> 01:23:32,380
its not easy for me to
visit this town.

743
01:23:32,546 --> 01:23:34,131
Were you really so unhappy?

744
01:23:34,298 --> 01:23:37,969
- Thats not what Im saying. Its not what I meant.
- Well then?

745
01:23:40,596 --> 01:23:43,099
You mustnt worry about Gertrud.

746
01:23:43,266 --> 01:23:45,685
Im going to look after her.
And anyway, lets face it, shes already

747
01:23:45,851 --> 01:23:47,311
a state prosecutor,

748
01:23:47,478 --> 01:23:51,023
she earns far more than I do.

749
01:23:52,358 --> 01:23:55,528
Michael, Im not worried about Gertrud.

750
01:23:55,695 --> 01:23:58,948
Im worried about you.

751
01:24:42,199 --> 01:24:45,286
Sing to me of the Man, Muse,

752
01:24:45,453 --> 01:24:49,165
the man of twists and turns
Driven time and again

753
01:24:49,332 --> 01:24:54,211
off course, once he had plundered
The hallowed heights of Troy...

754
01:25:20,488 --> 01:25:23,282
215- mail.

755
01:25:25,201 --> 01:25:27,995
217- mail.

756
01:25:44,011 --> 01:25:46,597
121966215.

757
01:25:46,973 --> 01:25:49,350
Number.

758
01:25:49,976 --> 01:25:52,520
open it.

759
01:26:08,494 --> 01:26:11,998
Testing. Testing. 1-2-3.
Testing. Testing.

760
01:26:32,602 --> 01:26:35,605
"The Odyssey." by Homer

761
01:26:47,950 --> 01:26:50,953
"The Odyssey." by Homer

762
01:26:51,704 --> 01:26:55,916
Sing to me of the Man, Muse,

763
01:26:56,083 --> 01:26:59,003
the man of twists and turns
Driven time and again

764
01:26:59,170 --> 01:27:03,633
off course, once he had plundered
The hallowed heights of Troy...

765
01:28:55,244 --> 01:28:59,206
The Lady with the Little Dog
by Anton Chekhov.

766
01:29:01,626 --> 01:29:05,713
"Talk of a new face, which
is a display of the prom..."

767
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:08,966
The Lady with the Little Dog

768
01:29:35,117 --> 01:29:38,287
I want to take out a book.

769
01:29:38,454 --> 01:29:40,748
Which book?

770
01:29:50,091 --> 01:29:53,135
Do you have "The Lady with the Little Dog"?

771
01:29:53,302 --> 01:29:56,305
Whats your name?

772
01:29:58,391 --> 01:30:01,227
Hanna Schmitz.

773
01:30:30,798 --> 01:30:33,718
The Lady with the Little Dog,

774
01:30:35,511 --> 01:30:37,511
42813 The Lady with the Little Dog,

775
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:54,363
1,2,3,4,5,6.

776
01:32:03,057 --> 01:32:09,897
Thanks for the latest, kid. I really liked it.

777
01:32:24,829 --> 01:32:27,123
- There is no letter?
- No letter.

778
01:32:27,290 --> 01:32:29,750
Sign it.

779
01:32:44,724 --> 01:32:48,394
<i>Please, send more romance</i>

780
01:33:03,659 --> 01:33:08,039
<i>I think schiller need a woman. "</i>

781
01:33:15,504 --> 01:33:19,550
<i>Are you getting my letter?
Write to me kid.</i>

782
01:33:56,587 --> 01:33:59,966
- Mr Michael Berg?
- Yes.

783
01:34:00,132 --> 01:34:03,636
Thank you for calling me.

784
01:34:03,803 --> 01:34:05,429
You got my letter?

785
01:34:05,596 --> 01:34:06,764
I have it here.

786
01:34:06,931 --> 01:34:10,726
As I say, Hanna Schmitz is coming
up for release very soon.

787
01:34:10,893 --> 01:34:14,855
Hanna has been in prison for over
twenty years.

788
01:34:15,022 --> 01:34:18,818
She has no family. She has no friends.

789
01:34:19,068 --> 01:34:22,280
Youre her only contact.

790
01:34:22,446 --> 01:34:24,782
And Im told you dont visit her.

791
01:34:24,949 --> 01:34:27,118
No. I dont.

792
01:34:27,285 --> 01:34:31,706
When she gets out, shes going to need a job.
Shes going to need somewhere to live.

793
01:34:31,872 --> 01:34:37,044
You cant imagine how frightening the modern
world will seem to her.

794
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:47,013
I have no one else to ask

795
01:34:47,179 --> 01:34:50,057
If you dont take responsibility for her,

796
01:34:50,224 --> 01:34:54,979
then Hanna has no future at all.

797
01:34:56,439 --> 01:35:01,152
Its kind of you.
Thank you for letting me know.

798
01:35:44,570 --> 01:35:45,863
Youre Michael Berg?

799
01:35:46,030 --> 01:35:49,283
I'm Louisa Brenner.
Good Morning!

800
01:35:49,492 --> 01:35:51,911
We were expecting you earlier.

801
01:35:52,078 --> 01:35:56,666
I should warn you: for a long time Hanna
held herself together.

802
01:35:56,832 --> 01:35:58,209
She was very purposeful.
In the last few years

803
01:35:58,376 --> 01:36:02,838
Shes different.
Shes let herself go.

804
01:36:04,882 --> 01:36:08,511
I'm taking you straight to the canteen.

805
01:36:09,303 --> 01:36:12,515
Theyre just finishing lunch.

806
01:36:23,567 --> 01:36:26,279
Before you.

807
01:37:11,532 --> 01:37:14,660
Youve grown up, kid

808
01:37:28,382 --> 01:37:31,802
Ive got a friend whos a tailor,

809
01:37:33,429 --> 01:37:36,140
he makes my suits. Hell give you a job.

810
01:37:36,474 --> 01:37:39,101
And Ive found you somewhere to live.
Its a nice place.

811
01:37:39,268 --> 01:37:42,897
Quite small but nice.
I think youll like it.

812
01:37:43,105 --> 01:37:46,859
- Youll like it.
- Thank you.

813
01:37:47,610 --> 01:37:50,321
There are various social programmes

814
01:37:50,488 --> 01:37:53,157
cultural stuff I can
sign you up for.

815
01:37:53,324 --> 01:37:56,953
And theres a
public library very close.

816
01:38:01,791 --> 01:38:04,585
You read a lot?

817
01:38:06,087 --> 01:38:09,298
I prefer being read to.

818
01:38:13,302 --> 01:38:16,639
Thats over now, isnt it?

819
01:38:24,772 --> 01:38:27,400
Did you get married?

820
01:38:27,566 --> 01:38:29,819
I did. Yes I did.

821
01:38:30,945 --> 01:38:32,530
We have a daughter.

822
01:38:32,697 --> 01:38:37,535
Im not seeing as much of her as I would like.
Id like to see a great deal more of her.

823
01:38:40,496 --> 01:38:44,041
The marriage didnt last.

824
01:38:57,888 --> 01:39:00,891
Have you spent a lot of time
thinking about the past?

825
01:39:01,058 --> 01:39:03,728
You mean, with you??

826
01:39:03,894 --> 01:39:06,272
No. No,

827
01:39:06,814 --> 01:39:09,900
I didnt mean with me.

828
01:39:17,658 --> 01:39:21,537
Before the trial I never thought
about the past.

829
01:39:21,704 --> 01:39:23,497
I never had to.

830
01:39:23,664 --> 01:39:25,958
And now?

831
01:39:26,125 --> 01:39:28,794
What do you feel now?

832
01:39:30,630 --> 01:39:32,840
It doesnt matter what I feel.

833
01:39:33,007 --> 01:39:36,427
It doesnt matter what I think.

834
01:39:38,054 --> 01:39:41,140
The dead are still dead.

835
01:39:47,021 --> 01:39:50,399
I wasnt sure what youd learnt.

836
01:39:50,566 --> 01:39:53,235
I have learnt, kid.

837
01:39:53,402 --> 01:39:56,614
Ive learnt to read.

838
01:40:09,669 --> 01:40:14,048
Ill pick you up next week, OK?

839
01:40:20,388 --> 01:40:23,182
That sounds a good plan.

840
01:40:25,226 --> 01:40:29,105
We can do quietly, or shall we make a
big fuss?

841
01:40:29,272 --> 01:40:31,857
Quietly.

842
01:40:32,900 --> 01:40:35,987
OK. Quietly.

843
01:40:48,124 --> 01:40:50,751
Take care, kid.
- You too.

844
01:40:50,918 --> 01:40:54,422
See you next week.

845
01:43:04,844 --> 01:43:08,806
I have come to collect Hanna Schmitz.

846
01:43:11,267 --> 01:43:14,270
Please, take a sit

847
01:43:39,879 --> 01:43:42,256
She didnt pack.

848
01:43:42,423 --> 01:43:45,843
She never intended to leave.

849
01:43:50,932 --> 01:43:56,896
"The talk was a new face.."

850
01:43:58,064 --> 01:44:01,150
The Lady with the Little Dog

851
01:44:07,448 --> 01:44:10,701
She left me a message,

852
01:44:10,868 --> 01:44:13,955
a sort of will.

853
01:44:15,623 --> 01:44:19,710
Ill read out the bit that
concerns you.

854
01:44:25,716 --> 01:44:28,386
There is money in the old tea tin.

855
01:44:28,552 --> 01:44:31,180
Give it to Michael Berg.

856
01:44:31,347 --> 01:44:35,726
He should send it, alongside the 7,000 marks
in the bank,

857
01:44:36,102 --> 01:44:40,189
to the daughter who survives the fire.

858
01:44:40,356 --> 01:44:42,316
Its for her.

859
01:44:42,483 --> 01:44:46,779
She should decide what to do with it.

860
01:44:47,905 --> 01:44:52,285
And tell Michael I said hello.

861
01:46:10,404 --> 01:46:12,990
- Ms Mather?
- Yes.

862
01:46:13,157 --> 01:46:14,825
- Michael Berg?
- Yes.

863
01:46:14,992 --> 01:46:17,578
Youre Michael Berg.
I was expecting you.

864
01:46:17,745 --> 01:46:20,998
- Please.
- Thank you.

865
01:46:22,416 --> 01:46:26,837
So you must tell me: Exactly
brings you to the United States?

866
01:46:27,004 --> 01:46:29,590
I was already here. I was at a
conference in Boston.

867
01:46:29,757 --> 01:46:31,550
Youre a lawyer?

868
01:46:31,717 --> 01:46:32,927
I was intrigued by your letter

869
01:46:33,094 --> 01:46:36,472
But I cant say I wholly understood it.

870
01:46:36,639 --> 01:46:37,890
You attended the trial?

871
01:46:38,057 --> 01:46:40,726
Yes. Almost twenty years ago.

872
01:46:40,893 --> 01:46:42,937
I was a law student.

873
01:46:43,104 --> 01:46:46,774
I remember you,
I remember your mother very clearly.

874
01:46:47,441 --> 01:46:51,779
My mother died in Israel
- A good many years ago.

875
01:46:52,530 --> 01:46:53,948
I'm sorry.

876
01:46:54,115 --> 01:46:57,243
Go On, please!

877
01:46:57,868 --> 01:47:03,040
Perhaps you heard. Hanna Schmitz
recently died.

878
01:47:03,374 --> 01:47:05,751
She killed herself.

879
01:47:05,918 --> 01:47:08,546
She was a friend of yours?

880
01:47:08,713 --> 01:47:11,299
A kind of friend.

881
01:47:12,091 --> 01:47:14,844
Its as simple as this.

882
01:47:15,011 --> 01:47:18,806
Hanna was illiterate for the
greater part of her life.

883
01:47:18,973 --> 01:47:22,643
Is that an explanation
of her behaviour?

884
01:47:23,352 --> 01:47:24,478
No.

885
01:47:24,645 --> 01:47:27,565
Or an excuse?

886
01:47:30,735 --> 01:47:34,196
No. No. She taught herself to read
when she was in prison.

887
01:47:34,363 --> 01:47:37,617
I sent her tapes.

888
01:47:39,910 --> 01:47:43,706
Shed always liked being read to.

889
01:47:50,671 --> 01:47:55,676
Why dont you start by being
honest with me?

890
01:47:56,552 --> 01:47:59,931
What was the nature of your friendship?

891
01:48:04,226 --> 01:48:08,564
When I was young
I had an affair with Hanna.

892
01:48:12,485 --> 01:48:15,988
Im not sure I can help you, Mr. Berg.

893
01:48:16,155 --> 01:48:19,367
Or rather, even if I could
Im not willing to

894
01:48:19,533 --> 01:48:22,078
I was almost sixteen when
I took up with her.

895
01:48:22,244 --> 01:48:24,538
The affair only lasted a summer. But..

896
01:48:24,705 --> 01:48:27,124
But what?

897
01:48:34,882 --> 01:48:37,426
I see.

898
01:48:37,802 --> 01:48:43,182
And did Hanna Schmitz acknowledge
the effect shed had on your life?

899
01:48:45,559 --> 01:48:49,939
Shed done much worse to other people.

900
01:48:53,401 --> 01:48:57,280
Ive never told anyone.

901
01:48:59,407 --> 01:49:04,036
People ask all the time what I
learned in the camps.

902
01:49:04,203 --> 01:49:07,331
But the camps
werent therapy.

903
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:12,128
What do you think
these places were? Universities?

904
01:49:12,545 --> 01:49:15,673
We didnt go there to learn.

905
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:19,176
One becomes very clear about these things.

906
01:49:22,388 --> 01:49:23,931
What are you asking for?

907
01:49:24,098 --> 01:49:25,266
Forgiveness for her?

908
01:49:25,433 --> 01:49:27,768
Or do you just want to feel better yourself?

909
01:49:27,935 --> 01:49:32,607
My advice, go to the theatre,
if you want catharsis, please.

910
01:49:32,773 --> 01:49:36,861
Go to literature.
Don't go to the camps.

911
01:49:38,654 --> 01:49:41,616
Nothing comes out of the camps.

912
01:49:43,618 --> 01:49:46,037
Nothing.

913
01:49:58,925 --> 01:50:01,510
What she wanted...

914
01:50:01,719 --> 01:50:06,182
what she wanted
was to leave you her money.

915
01:50:06,599 --> 01:50:07,892
I have with me.

916
01:50:08,059 --> 01:50:10,227
To do what?

917
01:50:11,187 --> 01:50:14,273
As you think fit.

918
01:50:24,075 --> 01:50:26,494
Here.

919
01:50:33,251 --> 01:50:36,551
When I was a little girl,
I had a tea-tin for my treasures.

920
01:50:38,547 --> 01:50:42,468
Not quite like this.
It had Cyrillic lettering.

921
01:50:46,138 --> 01:50:47,723
I took it with me to the camp,

922
01:50:47,890 --> 01:50:49,976
but it got stolen.

923
01:50:50,142 --> 01:50:51,394
What was in it?

924
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:53,187
Oh. Sentimental things.

925
01:50:53,354 --> 01:50:58,776
A piece of hair from our dog.
Some tickets to operas my father had taken me to.

926
01:50:59,068 --> 01:51:01,362
It wasnt stolen for its contents.

927
01:51:01,529 --> 01:51:04,907
It was the tin itself

928
01:51:05,241 --> 01:51:09,620
which was valuable,
what you could do with it.

929
01:51:17,211 --> 01:51:21,132
Theres nothing I can do with this money.

930
01:51:21,299 --> 01:51:25,011
If I give it to anything associated with the extermination
of the Jews, then to me it will seem

931
01:51:25,177 --> 01:51:28,806
like absolution and that is something

932
01:51:28,973 --> 01:51:33,019
Im neither willing nor
in a position to grant.

933
01:51:33,185 --> 01:51:38,190
I was thinking maybe an
organization to encourage literacy.

934
01:51:41,736 --> 01:51:44,113
Good.

935
01:51:45,031 --> 01:51:47,031
Do you know if theres a
Jewish organization?

936
01:51:47,700 --> 01:51:49,452
Ill be surprised if there isnt.

937
01:51:49,619 --> 01:51:52,663
Theres a Jewish organisation for everything.

938
01:51:52,830 --> 01:51:57,418
Not that illiteracy is
a very Jewish problem.

939
01:51:57,585 --> 01:52:01,923
Why dont you find out?
Send them the money.

940
01:52:17,021 --> 01:52:20,900
Shall I do it in Hannas name?

941
01:52:21,067 --> 01:52:24,862
As you think fit.

942
01:52:27,615 --> 01:52:30,701
Ill keep the tin.

943
01:52:34,288 --> 01:52:37,124
Thank you.

944
01:53:20,501 --> 01:53:23,421
January 1995

945
01:53:28,634 --> 01:53:30,177
Where are we going?

946
01:53:30,344 --> 01:53:33,014
I thought you liked surprises.

947
01:53:33,180 --> 01:53:36,309
I do. I do like surprises.

948
01:54:47,755 --> 01:54:50,299
Who was she?

949
01:54:51,342 --> 01:54:55,096
Thats what I wanted to tell you.

950
01:54:55,930 --> 01:54:59,350
Thats why were here.

951
01:55:06,190 --> 01:55:09,151
So tell me.

952
01:55:19,704 --> 01:55:22,540
I was 15,

953
01:55:24,500 --> 01:55:28,129
I was coming home from
school,

954
01:55:29,505 --> 01:55:32,425
I was ill...

955
01:55:32,883 --> 01:55:36,387
is a help to me a woman.
