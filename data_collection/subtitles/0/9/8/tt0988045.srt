1
00:01:38,981 --> 00:01:40,448
Head cocked to the left...

2
00:01:40,616 --> 00:01:42,413
partial deafness in ear.

3
00:01:42,585 --> 00:01:43,813
First point of attack.

4
00:01:45,988 --> 00:01:48,616
2, throat. Paralyze vocal cords.
Stop screaming.

5
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:52,794
3, got to be heavy drinker.
Floating rib to the liver.

6
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:56,330
4, finally, dragging left leg.
Fist to patella.

7
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,994
Summary of prognosis,
conscious in 90 seconds.

8
00:02:00,169 --> 00:02:01,898
Martial efficacy, quarter of an hour.

9
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:04,631
Full faculty recovery, unlikely.

10
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,213
I like the hat.

11
00:03:19,382 --> 00:03:20,872
I just picked it up.

12
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,813
Did you remember your revolver?

13
00:03:22,985 --> 00:03:24,213
Knew I forgot something.

14
00:03:24,887 --> 00:03:27,617
- Thought I'd left the stove on.
- You did.

15
00:03:30,026 --> 00:03:32,051
I think that's quite enough.

16
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,058
You are a doctor, after all.

17
00:03:39,702 --> 00:03:41,795
Always nice to see you, Watson.

18
00:03:44,207 --> 00:03:46,175
Where's the inspector?

19
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,570
He's getting his troops lined up.

20
00:03:48,744 --> 00:03:50,075
That could be all day.

21
00:04:48,571 --> 00:04:49,936
Sherlock Holmes.

22
00:04:51,774 --> 00:04:53,435
And his loyal dog.

23
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,374
Tell me, doctor...

24
00:04:55,544 --> 00:04:58,342
as a medical man,
have you enjoyed my work?

25
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,111
Let me show you
how much I've enjoyed it.

26
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,442
Watson. Don't.

27
00:05:07,623 --> 00:05:09,318
Observe.

28
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:14,093
How did you see that?

29
00:05:14,363 --> 00:05:15,625
Because I was looking for it.

30
00:05:20,636 --> 00:05:22,536
Lord Blackwood.

31
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:24,867
You seem surprised.

32
00:05:25,641 --> 00:05:28,576
I'd say the girl deserves your attention
more than he.

33
00:05:29,712 --> 00:05:31,509
Indeed.

34
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,416
I'd leave that alone
if I were you, boy-o.

35
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:41,550
Good lad.

36
00:05:41,857 --> 00:05:43,984
Impeccable timing, Lestrade.

37
00:05:45,161 --> 00:05:46,719
We've one for the doctor...

38
00:05:46,896 --> 00:05:48,386
and one for the rope.

39
00:05:48,898 --> 00:05:50,365
- Clarkie?
- Sir?

40
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:52,398
This woman needs a hospital
immediately.

41
00:05:52,568 --> 00:05:54,195
Put her in the back of the Moriah.

42
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,564
Right, lads. That's it.

43
00:05:58,841 --> 00:06:01,708
- Right. Pick him up, lads.
- Yes, sir.

44
00:06:01,877 --> 00:06:03,811
If you don't mind.

45
00:06:05,414 --> 00:06:06,711
Get him out of my sight.

46
00:06:12,355 --> 00:06:14,448
And you were supposed to
wait for my orders.

47
00:06:15,758 --> 00:06:19,854
If I had, you'd be cleaning up a corpse
and chasing a rumor.

48
00:06:20,029 --> 00:06:22,930
Besides, the girl's parents hired me,
not the Yard.

49
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:25,932
Why they thought you'd require
any assistance is beyond me.

50
00:06:26,102 --> 00:06:28,798
Well, London will breathe a sigh of relief.

51
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,132
Indeed. Congratulations, Lestrade.

52
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,935
Bravo, inspector. Have a cigar.

53
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,441
Gentlemen.

54
00:06:35,611 --> 00:06:36,839
Cheese.

55
00:07:05,775 --> 00:07:08,642
Blackwood hangs tomorrow.
Read all about it.

56
00:07:12,748 --> 00:07:16,684
156 over 80. Very good.

57
00:07:16,852 --> 00:07:20,288
My nerves are the best they've been
in years, thanks to you.

58
00:07:20,456 --> 00:07:21,889
Tell me something.

59
00:07:22,057 --> 00:07:24,048
Your new premises...

60
00:07:24,226 --> 00:07:25,454
when are you moving in?

61
00:07:25,628 --> 00:07:27,459
I should be in within the week.

62
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,997
Cavendish Place.
And there'll be a woman's touch too.

63
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:32,532
- Well, that's marvelous.
- Indeed.

64
00:07:34,336 --> 00:07:36,236
Good God.

65
00:07:37,306 --> 00:07:39,297
- That was gunfire.
- No.

66
00:07:39,475 --> 00:07:42,569
No, no. Hammer and nail, wasn't it?

67
00:07:42,745 --> 00:07:45,976
My colleague's probably
just putting up a painting.

68
00:07:46,148 --> 00:07:48,343
I'll... I'll go and check.

69
00:07:48,517 --> 00:07:50,485
- Your colleague...
- Yes?

70
00:07:50,653 --> 00:07:53,019
Won't be moving with you, will he?

71
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,323
No, he won't.

72
00:07:57,693 --> 00:07:59,092
Mrs. Hudson.

73
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:01,821
I won't go in,
not while he's got a gun in his hand.

74
00:08:01,997 --> 00:08:03,726
You don't have to. Give me the paper.

75
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:07,460
What'll I do when you leave, doctor?
He'll have the whole house down.

76
00:08:07,636 --> 00:08:09,501
He just needs another case. That's all.

77
00:08:09,672 --> 00:08:11,765
Couldn't you have a longer engagement?

78
00:08:11,941 --> 00:08:15,342
I smell gunpowder. It's not right, you know,
not in a domestic environment.

79
00:08:17,046 --> 00:08:20,015
Thank you, Captain Philips.
Perhaps a nice cup of tea?

80
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,817
- Same time next week.
- Come along, captain.

81
00:08:23,986 --> 00:08:26,250
- It's quieter downstairs.
- Mrs. Hudson?

82
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:27,912
Bring something to cheer him up.

83
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:40,367
Permission to enter the armory?

84
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:41,560
Granted.

85
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:47,498
Watson, I am in the process
of inventing a device...

86
00:08:47,676 --> 00:08:49,667
that suppresses the sound
of a gunshot.

87
00:08:53,082 --> 00:08:55,016
It's not working.

88
00:08:55,184 --> 00:08:56,811
Can I see that?

89
00:09:04,793 --> 00:09:07,125
You know, it's been 3 months...

90
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,560
since your last case.

91
00:09:12,101 --> 00:09:14,569
Yes, yes. Gently, gently, Watson.
Be gentle with me...

92
00:09:17,606 --> 00:09:20,200
Don't you think it's time
you found another one?

93
00:09:22,244 --> 00:09:23,643
I can't but agree.

94
00:09:23,812 --> 00:09:27,373
My mind rebels at stagnation.
Give me problems. Give me work.

95
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,177
The sooner, the better.

96
00:09:29,752 --> 00:09:31,083
Paper.

97
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:34,951
Let's see, then. There's a letter here...

98
00:09:35,124 --> 00:09:38,423
from Mrs. Ramsey of Queen's Park.

99
00:09:38,594 --> 00:09:42,121
- Her husband's disappeared.
- He's in Belgium with the scullery maid.

100
00:09:42,298 --> 00:09:43,925
Is it November?

101
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:46,728
Yes, Holmes. All right.

102
00:09:46,902 --> 00:09:49,700
Lady Radford reports...

103
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,067
Her emerald bracelet
has disappeared.

104
00:09:52,241 --> 00:09:56,541
Insurance swindle. Lord Radford
likes fast women and slow ponies.

105
00:09:57,112 --> 00:10:00,409
I see you're the attending physician
at Blackwood's hanging.

106
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:01,607
Yes.

107
00:10:01,784 --> 00:10:05,379
It was our last case together
and I wanted to see it through to the end.

108
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:13,722
A Mr. Lewis is seeking...

109
00:10:13,896 --> 00:10:16,592
There's only one case
that intrigues me at present:

110
00:10:16,765 --> 00:10:20,861
The curious case of Mrs. Hudson,
the absentee landlady.

111
00:10:21,036 --> 00:10:23,061
I've been studying
her comings and goings.

112
00:10:23,238 --> 00:10:25,331
They appear most sinister.

113
00:10:25,941 --> 00:10:27,203
Tea, Mr. Holmes?

114
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,638
Is it poisoned, nanny?

115
00:10:29,244 --> 00:10:31,144
There's enough of that in you already.

116
00:10:31,313 --> 00:10:33,838
Don't touch.
Everything is in its proper place...

117
00:10:34,016 --> 00:10:36,348
as per usual, nanny.

118
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,714
He's killed the dog. Again.

119
00:10:39,888 --> 00:10:42,254
What have you done to Gladstone now?

120
00:10:42,424 --> 00:10:45,518
I was simply testing a new anesthetic.

121
00:10:45,694 --> 00:10:47,355
He doesn't mind.

122
00:10:49,365 --> 00:10:51,629
Holmes, as your doctor...

123
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,998
- He'll be as right as a trivet in no time.
- As your friend...

124
00:10:56,171 --> 00:11:00,198
you've been in this room for 2 weeks.
I insist, you have to get out.

125
00:11:00,376 --> 00:11:04,472
There's nothing of interest for me
out there, on earth, at all.

126
00:11:06,382 --> 00:11:08,247
- You're free this evening?
- Absolutely.

127
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,647
- Dinner? The Royale?
- Wonderful. My favorite.

128
00:11:11,086 --> 00:11:12,348
Mary's coming.

129
00:11:13,789 --> 00:11:16,451
- Not available.
- You're meeting her, Holmes.

130
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,491
Have you proposed yet?

131
00:11:20,396 --> 00:11:23,695
- No, I haven't found the right ring.
- Then it's not official.

132
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:25,993
It's happening, whether you like it or not.

133
00:11:26,168 --> 00:11:28,227
8:30, the Royale. Wear a jacket.

134
00:11:28,404 --> 00:11:30,031
You wear a jacket.

135
00:11:43,886 --> 00:11:46,354
A man? Outside my house?

136
00:11:52,928 --> 00:11:54,862
Straighten your tie.

137
00:12:05,507 --> 00:12:06,800
Holmes.

138
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,741
You're early.

139
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,638
Fashionably.

140
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,783
Miss Mary Morstan.

141
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,282
My goodness. What a pleasure.

142
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,087
I don't know why it's taken him so long
to introduce us properly.

143
00:12:21,256 --> 00:12:22,655
Pleasure is mine.

144
00:12:27,563 --> 00:12:30,896
It really is quite a thrill to meet you,
Mr. Holmes.

145
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:33,034
I've heard so much about you.

146
00:12:33,402 --> 00:12:35,529
I have a pile of detective novels at home.

147
00:12:35,704 --> 00:12:37,899
- Wilkie Collins, Poe.
- It's true.

148
00:12:38,073 --> 00:12:40,564
It can seem a little far-fetched
though sometimes...

149
00:12:40,976 --> 00:12:43,467
making grand assumptions
out of tiny details.

150
00:12:43,645 --> 00:12:45,442
That's not quite right, is it?

151
00:12:45,714 --> 00:12:48,581
In fact, the little details
are by far the most important.

152
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,451
- Take Watson.
- I intend to.

153
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:00,050
See his walking stick?
A rare African snakewood...

154
00:13:00,229 --> 00:13:02,697
hiding a blade of high-tensile steel.

155
00:13:03,966 --> 00:13:06,298
A few were awarded
to veterans of the Afghan war...

156
00:13:06,468 --> 00:13:08,493
so I can assume
he's a decorated soldier.

157
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,696
Strong, brave,
born to be a man of action.

158
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,502
And neat, like all military men.

159
00:13:14,676 --> 00:13:17,645
Now, I check his pockets.

160
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,213
A stub from a boxing match.
Now I can infer that he's a bit of a gambler.

161
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,046
I'd keep an eye on that dowry.

162
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,518
- Those days are behind me.
- Right behind you.

163
00:13:27,689 --> 00:13:29,520
He's cost us the rent more than once.

164
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:33,359
Well, with all due respect, Mr. Holmes,
you know John very well.

165
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:36,020
What about a complete stranger?

166
00:13:36,932 --> 00:13:38,957
- What can you tell about me?
- You?

167
00:13:39,134 --> 00:13:40,692
- I don't think...
- I don't know that...

168
00:13:40,869 --> 00:13:41,995
- Not at dinner.
- Some other time.

169
00:13:42,171 --> 00:13:43,297
- I insist.
- You insist?

170
00:13:43,472 --> 00:13:46,566
- You remember we discussed this.
- The lady insists.

171
00:13:52,948 --> 00:13:54,438
- You're a governess.
- Well done.

172
00:13:54,616 --> 00:13:56,208
Yes, well done. Shall we?

173
00:13:56,385 --> 00:13:58,683
- Waiter?
- Your student...

174
00:13:58,854 --> 00:14:00,185
is a boy of 8.

175
00:14:00,355 --> 00:14:03,222
- Charlie's 7, actually.
- Charlie?

176
00:14:03,392 --> 00:14:06,225
Then he's tall for his age.
He flicked ink at you today.

177
00:14:06,795 --> 00:14:07,989
Is there ink on my face?

178
00:14:08,163 --> 00:14:10,097
There's nothing wrong with your face.

179
00:14:10,265 --> 00:14:12,199
There are 2 drops on your ear, in fact.

180
00:14:12,367 --> 00:14:14,528
India blue's nearly impossible
to wash off.

181
00:14:14,703 --> 00:14:16,330
A very impetuous act by the boy.

182
00:14:16,505 --> 00:14:18,632
But you're too experienced
to react rashly...

183
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:21,571
which is why the lady for whom you work
lent you that.

184
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:26,276
Oriental pearls, diamonds, a flawless ruby.
Hardly the gems of a governess.

185
00:14:30,118 --> 00:14:32,279
The jewels you are not wearing
tell us more.

186
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,752
- Holmes.
- You were engaged.

187
00:14:34,923 --> 00:14:37,391
The ring is gone,
but the lighter skin suggests...

188
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:40,289
that you spent some time abroad
wearing it proudly...

189
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,953
until you were informed
of its true, modest worth.

190
00:14:43,131 --> 00:14:44,792
You broke off the engagement...

191
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,765
and returned to England
for better prospects.

192
00:14:48,403 --> 00:14:50,564
A doctor, perhaps.

193
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:59,203
Right on all counts, Mr. Holmes,
apart from one.

194
00:15:02,184 --> 00:15:04,152
I didn't leave him.

195
00:15:04,453 --> 00:15:05,943
He died.

196
00:15:15,864 --> 00:15:17,456
Well done, old boy.

197
00:15:53,969 --> 00:15:56,096
- Fight. Fight.
- Get him.

198
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,235
Get up and fight.

199
00:16:36,211 --> 00:16:37,508
Fight.

200
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:39,169
- Finish it.
- Come on.

201
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,347
Get up and fight, come on.

202
00:16:47,956 --> 00:16:49,548
Come on.

203
00:16:50,826 --> 00:16:52,157
Get up.

204
00:16:54,463 --> 00:16:56,488
Get up and fight.

205
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,202
That's it, big man, we're done.

206
00:17:05,574 --> 00:17:07,303
You won, congratulations.

207
00:17:08,143 --> 00:17:09,371
We ain't done yet.

208
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,446
This mustn't register
on an emotional level.

209
00:17:18,587 --> 00:17:20,282
First, distract target.

210
00:17:21,523 --> 00:17:23,218
Then block his blind jab.

211
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,260
Counter with cross to left cheek.

212
00:17:27,729 --> 00:17:29,594
Discombobulate.

213
00:17:29,765 --> 00:17:31,665
Dazed, he'll attempt wild haymaker.

214
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,961
Employ elbow block, and body shot.

215
00:17:36,238 --> 00:17:38,433
Block feral left. Weaken right jaw.

216
00:17:40,442 --> 00:17:42,069
Now fracture.

217
00:17:43,745 --> 00:17:45,474
Break cracked ribs.

218
00:17:45,914 --> 00:17:47,313
Traumatize solar plexus.

219
00:17:47,883 --> 00:17:49,248
Dislocate jaw entirely.

220
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,455
Heel kick to diaphragm.

221
00:17:56,525 --> 00:18:00,928
In summary, ears ringing, jaw fractured,
3 ribs cracked, 4 broken...

222
00:18:01,096 --> 00:18:03,894
diaphragm hemorrhaging,
physical recovery, 6 weeks...

223
00:18:04,566 --> 00:18:06,898
full psychological recovery,
6 months...

224
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:09,162
capacity to spit at back of head...

225
00:18:09,337 --> 00:18:11,032
neutralized.

226
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,061
Where did that come from?

227
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,403
What the hell's going on here, Charlie?

228
00:19:22,577 --> 00:19:25,102
Lord Blackwood's put him
under some kind of spell, sir.

229
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,010
It's like he's burning from the inside out.

230
00:19:30,685 --> 00:19:33,415
You lot, shut up!

231
00:19:33,788 --> 00:19:35,380
Charlie. Charlie!

232
00:19:35,891 --> 00:19:37,688
Take this man to the infirmary, now.

233
00:19:50,405 --> 00:19:52,600
What's this all about, then, Blackwood?

234
00:19:56,912 --> 00:19:58,903
There's someone I want to see.

235
00:20:19,467 --> 00:20:21,594
- Watson?
- Right.

236
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,465
Le's go.

237
00:20:24,072 --> 00:20:26,040
What started merely as an experiment...

238
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:29,143
has brought me to the threshold
of a monumental discovery.

239
00:20:29,411 --> 00:20:32,244
Now, if I play a chromatic scale...

240
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:34,712
there's no measurable response.

241
00:20:34,883 --> 00:20:37,613
You do know what you're drinking
is meant for eye surgery?

242
00:20:37,786 --> 00:20:39,151
But, now...

243
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,618
and this is remarkable...

244
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:44,418
if I change to atonal clusters...

245
00:20:45,493 --> 00:20:49,930
voil, they fly in counterclockwise,
synchronized concentric circles...

246
00:20:50,098 --> 00:20:51,690
as though a regimented flock.

247
00:20:51,866 --> 00:20:53,493
Watson, this is exceptional.

248
00:20:53,668 --> 00:20:58,435
I, using musical theory,
have created order out of chaos.

249
00:20:59,975 --> 00:21:01,237
How did you lure them in?

250
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,109
Excellent question.

251
00:21:03,278 --> 00:21:06,179
Individually. I've been at it for 6 hours.

252
00:21:06,915 --> 00:21:08,974
- And what happens if I do this?
- What?

253
00:21:12,287 --> 00:21:13,652
- Right.
- Clean yourself up.

254
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,290
You are Blackwood's last request.

255
00:21:28,703 --> 00:21:30,762
Look at those towering structures.

256
00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:35,236
It's the first combination of bascule
and suspension bridge ever attempted.

257
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,310
Most innovative.

258
00:21:40,115 --> 00:21:41,673
What an industrious empire.

259
00:21:44,218 --> 00:21:46,343
I have your winnings from last night.

260
00:21:47,756 --> 00:21:50,589
You weren't there,
so I made your customary bet.

261
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:56,455
Right. I'll keep it with your checkbook,
locked safely away in my drawer.

262
00:21:58,566 --> 00:22:01,296
Did you know the opera house
is featuring Don Giovanni?

263
00:22:01,469 --> 00:22:06,031
I could procure a couple of tickets if you
had any cultural inclinations this evening.

264
00:22:09,311 --> 00:22:11,541
You have the grand gift of silence,
Watson.

265
00:22:11,713 --> 00:22:14,341
It makes you quite invaluable
as a companion.

266
00:22:16,751 --> 00:22:19,117
I knew she'd been engaged.

267
00:22:19,287 --> 00:22:20,379
She had told me.

268
00:22:20,555 --> 00:22:22,250
So that's no to the opera, then?

269
00:22:28,963 --> 00:22:32,023
- That was my waistcoat.
- We agreed it's too small for you.

270
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,690
- I'd like it back.
- We agreed.

271
00:22:33,868 --> 00:22:35,358
I want it back.

272
00:23:08,269 --> 00:23:10,294
This way, Mr. Holmes.

273
00:23:11,606 --> 00:23:15,406
Blackwood certainly seems to have got
the crowd into something of a fear frenzy.

274
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:19,046
Which I'm certain will disperse
once his feet have stopped twitching.

275
00:23:19,214 --> 00:23:20,704
Care to come along?

276
00:23:20,882 --> 00:23:24,181
No, old cock.
I've no business with him whilst he's alive.

277
00:23:24,352 --> 00:23:26,650
Suit yourself, mother hen.

278
00:23:38,466 --> 00:23:41,731
It seems you have lots of rooms to let.

279
00:23:41,903 --> 00:23:45,703
We had to move the prisoners, sir.
Otherwise we were gonna have a riot.

280
00:23:45,874 --> 00:23:49,139
He has a peculiar effect on the inmates.

281
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,902
As though...

282
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:54,413
he can get inside their heads.

283
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,420
I can find my own way
if you have other duties to perform.

284
00:24:00,588 --> 00:24:03,318
Much obliged, sir. Thank you, sir.

285
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:07,992
If any man have an ear, let him hear.

286
00:24:08,163 --> 00:24:11,064
I stood upon the sand of the sea
and saw a beast rise up...

287
00:24:11,232 --> 00:24:12,961
having 7 heads and 10 horns.

288
00:24:13,134 --> 00:24:15,432
Upon his heads were
the name of blasphemy.

289
00:24:15,603 --> 00:24:17,867
They worshiped the dragon,
which gave power.

290
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,599
They worshiped, saying,
"Who is like unto the beast?"

291
00:24:20,775 --> 00:24:22,640
The beast which I saw
was like a leopard.

292
00:24:22,811 --> 00:24:25,473
His feet were of a bear,
his mouth was of a lion...

293
00:24:25,647 --> 00:24:29,276
and the dragon gave him his power
and his seat and great authority.

294
00:24:29,451 --> 00:24:31,749
I love what you've done with the place.

295
00:24:33,421 --> 00:24:35,719
So glad you could accept my invitation.

296
00:24:36,324 --> 00:24:38,918
I just have a small point of concern.

297
00:24:39,761 --> 00:24:42,491
- How can I help?
- I'd followed the murders with interest.

298
00:24:42,697 --> 00:24:45,495
While my heart went out
to the families of the victims...

299
00:24:45,667 --> 00:24:49,626
I couldn't but notice a criminal mastery
in the stroke of your brush.

300
00:24:49,904 --> 00:24:52,236
- You're too kind.
- However, by comparison...

301
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:56,241
your work in the crypt
was more akin to a finger painting.

302
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,948
So now you're curious
as to whether there's a larger game afoot.

303
00:25:03,117 --> 00:25:05,279
Either that or...

304
00:25:05,954 --> 00:25:09,822
shortly my friend will pronounce you dead
and I thought I might keep him company.

305
00:25:09,991 --> 00:25:13,427
Your mistake is to imagine that
anything earthly's led to this moment.

306
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:17,588
Your error of judgment is to assume
that I'm holding the brush at all.

307
00:25:17,765 --> 00:25:21,292
- I'm merely the channel.
- My only wish is that I caught you sooner.

308
00:25:21,469 --> 00:25:24,233
You see,
5 lives might have been spared.

309
00:25:25,005 --> 00:25:27,397
Those lives were a necessity.

310
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,737
Sacrifice.

311
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,214
5 meaningless creatures
called to serve a greater purpose.

312
00:25:34,382 --> 00:25:36,816
I wonder if they'd let Watson and me
dissect your brain.

313
00:25:36,985 --> 00:25:38,714
After you're hanged, of course.

314
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:43,724
I'd wager there's some deformity
tha'd be scientifically significant.

315
00:25:43,892 --> 00:25:47,521
Then you, too,
could serve a greater purpose.

316
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:51,758
Mr. Holmes, you must widen your gaze.

317
00:25:51,933 --> 00:25:56,802
I'm concerned you underestimate
the gravity of coming events.

318
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,633
You and I are bound together
on a journey...

319
00:25:59,807 --> 00:26:02,367
that will twist the very fabric of nature.

320
00:26:02,911 --> 00:26:07,007
But beneath your mask of logic,
I sense a fragility.

321
00:26:07,382 --> 00:26:09,247
That worries me.

322
00:26:10,084 --> 00:26:12,746
Steel your mind, Holmes.

323
00:26:13,388 --> 00:26:14,412
I need you.

324
00:26:14,589 --> 00:26:17,023
You've come a long way down
from the House of Lords.

325
00:26:17,191 --> 00:26:18,749
- And I will rise again.
- Bon voyage.

326
00:26:18,927 --> 00:26:20,588
Pay attention.

327
00:26:20,762 --> 00:26:24,095
3 more will die, and there is
nothing you can do to save them.

328
00:26:24,265 --> 00:26:27,325
You must accept
that this is beyond your control...

329
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:31,029
or, by the time you realize you
made all of this possible...

330
00:26:31,205 --> 00:26:34,436
i'll be the last sane thought
in your head.

331
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,540
What did he want?

332
00:26:43,718 --> 00:26:45,276
Not sure.

333
00:26:45,453 --> 00:26:48,422
But I don't think you're needed, Father.
Not for this one.

334
00:26:50,224 --> 00:26:52,158
Lord Henry Blackwood...

335
00:26:52,327 --> 00:26:56,764
you are sentenced to death
for the practice of black magic...

336
00:26:57,198 --> 00:27:00,258
the unholy murder of
5 innocent young women...

337
00:27:00,435 --> 00:27:02,835
and the attempted murder of a 6th.

338
00:27:03,571 --> 00:27:05,505
Do you have any final words?

339
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,133
Death...

340
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,337
is only the beginning.

341
00:27:22,523 --> 00:27:24,616
Forever and ever. Amen.

342
00:27:45,913 --> 00:27:49,246
That is the end of Lord Blackwood.

343
00:28:10,571 --> 00:28:13,597
London's so bleak this time of year.

344
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:17,411
Not that I'm pining for New Jersey.

345
00:28:17,578 --> 00:28:20,069
I much prefer to travel in the winter.

346
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,715
Here, I brought you these,
all the way from Syria.

347
00:28:25,887 --> 00:28:28,754
I found these exquisite dates in Jordan...

348
00:28:28,923 --> 00:28:30,948
and your favorite...

349
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:33,491
olives from the Cyclades.

350
00:28:33,661 --> 00:28:35,891
Thought we might have a little tea party.

351
00:28:36,064 --> 00:28:39,522
And while I was setting the table,
I found this:

352
00:28:39,701 --> 00:28:41,760
A file with my name on it.

353
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:44,969
"Theft of Velzquez portrait
from king of Spain."

354
00:28:45,973 --> 00:28:49,966
"Missing naval documents lead
to resignation of Bulgarian prime minister."

355
00:28:51,446 --> 00:28:55,143
"Scandalous affair ends engagement of...

356
00:28:58,586 --> 00:29:00,713
Hapsburg prince
to Romanov princess."

357
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:04,814
I was simply studying your methods...

358
00:29:04,992 --> 00:29:06,926
should the authorities
ask me to hunt you down.

359
00:29:08,796 --> 00:29:10,991
But I don't see my name
in any of these articles.

360
00:29:11,165 --> 00:29:12,928
But your signature was clear.

361
00:29:14,569 --> 00:29:16,560
Is that the maharajah's
missing diamond?

362
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:19,931
Or just another souvenir?

363
00:29:20,575 --> 00:29:22,668
Let's not dwell on the past.

364
00:29:24,178 --> 00:29:25,873
Shall we?

365
00:29:28,082 --> 00:29:30,141
By the looks of things,
you're between jobs.

366
00:29:30,318 --> 00:29:33,583
And you between husbands.
How much did you get for the ring?

367
00:29:34,021 --> 00:29:37,650
He was boring and jealous,
and he snored.

368
00:29:40,661 --> 00:29:42,458
I'm Irene Adler again.

369
00:29:49,804 --> 00:29:51,294
Thank you.

370
00:29:57,445 --> 00:29:58,878
I need your help.

371
00:29:59,614 --> 00:30:01,809
I need you to find someone.

372
00:30:04,285 --> 00:30:05,843
Why are you always so suspicious?

373
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,545
Shall I answer chronologically
or alphabetically?

374
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:12,682
Careful not to cut yourself
on this lethal envelope.

375
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:18,656
I think you'll find all the information
you need inside.

376
00:30:19,967 --> 00:30:21,662
Who are you working for?

377
00:30:23,237 --> 00:30:25,034
So I'll have to find out the hard way?

378
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,572
Keep your money.
I didn't say I'll take the case.

379
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:31,234
Well, consider it a wager that you will.

380
00:30:32,113 --> 00:30:34,343
Do you remember The Grand?

381
00:30:34,515 --> 00:30:36,745
They gave me our old room.

382
00:30:50,164 --> 00:30:51,495
Hold the door.

383
00:30:51,666 --> 00:30:53,531
Thanks, doctor.

384
00:31:16,123 --> 00:31:17,590
Ma'am.

385
00:31:21,262 --> 00:31:24,493
- He'll do it.
- Well done, Miss Adler.

386
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:27,390
That's precisely why I hired you.

387
00:31:28,569 --> 00:31:31,163
I wager he'll have our man
within the next 24 hours.

388
00:31:31,339 --> 00:31:32,897
He'd better.

389
00:31:33,074 --> 00:31:35,304
Reordan is the key
to what Blackwood was doing.

390
00:31:36,377 --> 00:31:38,140
He's essential to my plan.

391
00:31:38,312 --> 00:31:40,439
Get off out of it.

392
00:31:40,615 --> 00:31:43,243
What you doing?
Can't you see where you're going?

393
00:31:43,417 --> 00:31:45,408
- You scalp diver.
- Get off out of it.

394
00:31:46,454 --> 00:31:49,116
A little rifle range
would go a long way, sir...

395
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:52,691
rubbing the calluses
off these German bands.

396
00:31:53,427 --> 00:31:54,758
God save the queen.

397
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:57,227
God save the queen, sir.

398
00:31:57,398 --> 00:31:58,729
Get off out of it.

399
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,201
Look at you.

400
00:32:04,805 --> 00:32:07,399
Why is the only woman
you've cared about a criminal?

401
00:32:07,575 --> 00:32:08,599
Are you a masochist?

402
00:32:08,776 --> 00:32:10,869
- Allow me to explain.
- Allow me.

403
00:32:11,045 --> 00:32:14,811
She's the only adversary
who ever outsmarted you. Twice.

404
00:32:14,982 --> 00:32:16,643
Made a proper idiot out of you.

405
00:32:16,817 --> 00:32:19,445
- Right, you've had your fun.
- What's she after, anyway?

406
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,088
- It's time to press on.
- What could she possibly need?

407
00:32:22,256 --> 00:32:23,655
It doesn't matter.

408
00:32:23,824 --> 00:32:26,952
An alibi? A beard? A human canoe.

409
00:32:27,128 --> 00:32:29,961
She could sit on your back
and paddle you up the Thames.

410
00:32:30,131 --> 00:32:32,224
That's of no consequence to you, is it?

411
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,334
We've done our last case together.

412
00:32:34,502 --> 00:32:36,094
I've already read it.

413
00:32:36,971 --> 00:32:38,962
Missing person:

414
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:42,132
Luke Reordan, 4 foot 10,
red hair, no front teeth.

415
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,334
Case solved.

416
00:32:43,511 --> 00:32:46,810
You're obviously not her type.
She likes ginger dwarves.

417
00:32:46,981 --> 00:32:48,608
- Midget.
- So you agree?

418
00:32:48,783 --> 00:32:50,045
No, I don't agree.

419
00:32:50,217 --> 00:32:52,777
It's more than technicality, you see.

420
00:32:52,954 --> 00:32:56,014
You're misrepresenting the dimensions
of foreshortened peoples.

421
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:59,717
- I've said too much. I've upset you.
- No, I am simply stating that one has...

422
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,384
What were you doing?

423
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:04,156
- Will you allow me to explain?
- I wish you would.

424
00:33:27,421 --> 00:33:30,254
- Holmes. What are you doing?
- Nothing.

425
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:33,052
- Are you wearing a false...?
- False nose? No.

426
00:33:33,327 --> 00:33:35,659
- Tell me that that wasn't...
- That wasn't.

427
00:33:37,198 --> 00:33:39,666
Holmes. Where are you going?

428
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,071
Watson.

429
00:33:47,174 --> 00:33:48,505
Watson.

430
00:34:07,428 --> 00:34:11,364
Got some flowers for you, sweetheart.
Cut you a deal because you're so pretty.

431
00:34:13,132 --> 00:34:15,400
My lucky day.

432
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:18,468
Hello, gorgeous.
You got something for me?

433
00:34:22,209 --> 00:34:23,904
Don't move.

434
00:34:27,882 --> 00:34:28,940
Now, what have we got here?

435
00:34:30,317 --> 00:34:31,443
It's...

436
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:36,516
Thank you.

437
00:34:37,391 --> 00:34:39,586
That's the Irene I know.

438
00:34:47,134 --> 00:34:48,328
Good boy.

439
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:34,147
This man intrigues me, Watson.
He's got Adler on edge.

440
00:35:34,315 --> 00:35:36,681
- Which is no mean feat.
- She's intimidated.

441
00:35:36,851 --> 00:35:38,011
She's scared of him.

442
00:35:38,185 --> 00:35:39,345
Yet she works for him.

443
00:35:41,088 --> 00:35:42,919
- Right.
- It's nothing to do with me...

444
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:45,820
but I advise you leave the case alone.

445
00:35:45,993 --> 00:35:47,551
Well, I may not have a choice.

446
00:35:48,762 --> 00:35:51,822
After all, I may be paying the rent
on my own soon, thanks to you.

447
00:35:52,399 --> 00:35:54,890
- Get that out of my face.
- It's not. It's in my hand.

448
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,366
Get what's in your hand out of my face.

449
00:35:56,537 --> 00:35:57,834
- Mr. Holmes?
- Clarkie.

450
00:35:58,706 --> 00:36:01,140
Sir, Inspector Lestrade asks
that you come with me at once.

451
00:36:01,308 --> 00:36:03,970
What's he done now,
lost his way to Scotland Yard?

452
00:36:04,145 --> 00:36:06,204
Watson, grab a compass.
"You" means "us."

453
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,904
No, "you" means you.

454
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:10,482
It's Lord Blackwood, sir. He...

455
00:36:10,651 --> 00:36:11,982
Well...

456
00:36:12,419 --> 00:36:15,445
it appears he's come back
from the grave, sir.

457
00:36:23,197 --> 00:36:26,189
- Most engaging.
- Very clever.

458
00:36:26,367 --> 00:36:28,267
I pronounced the man dead myself.

459
00:36:30,204 --> 00:36:31,671
What are the facts?

460
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:35,104
Groundskeeper saw him walking
through the graveyard this morning.

461
00:36:35,709 --> 00:36:37,973
I'll leave this in your capable hands.

462
00:36:38,512 --> 00:36:42,710
- I have an appointment with Mary.
- It's not my reputation that's at stake here.

463
00:36:42,883 --> 00:36:44,441
Don't try that.

464
00:36:44,618 --> 00:36:47,849
- The newspapers got wind of it?
- That's what we're trying to avoid.

465
00:36:48,022 --> 00:36:49,614
Certainly.

466
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:51,221
What's the major concern?

467
00:36:51,392 --> 00:36:53,860
Panic. Sheer bloody panic, sir.

468
00:36:54,028 --> 00:36:56,895
- Indeed.
- You're not taking this seriously, are you?

469
00:36:57,064 --> 00:36:58,554
Yes, as you should.

470
00:37:00,534 --> 00:37:02,593
It's a matter of professional integrity.

471
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:06,729
No girl wants to marry a doctor
who can't tell if a man's dead or not.

472
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:25,087
Who do you think won the match,
Clarkie?

473
00:37:25,259 --> 00:37:27,693
- Sir?
- The rugby match.

474
00:37:28,295 --> 00:37:31,958
Your boys have done a magnificent job
obliterating any potential evidence.

475
00:37:32,132 --> 00:37:36,159
Yes. But at least they never miss
an opportunity to miss an opportunity.

476
00:37:39,139 --> 00:37:41,130
You took your time, Holmes.

477
00:37:41,308 --> 00:37:44,505
"And on the 3rd day"...

478
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,274
These slabs are half a ton each
if they're a pound...

479
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:51,543
and they're smashed open
from the inside.

480
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:54,313
Lestrade, what of the coffin?

481
00:37:54,488 --> 00:37:57,855
- We are in the process of bringing it up.
- I see.

482
00:37:59,226 --> 00:38:03,092
Right. At what stage of the process?
Contemplative?

483
00:38:05,699 --> 00:38:07,428
Anyhow, where's our witness?

484
00:38:07,601 --> 00:38:08,898
He's over there.

485
00:38:09,069 --> 00:38:11,230
And apparently, he is cata...

486
00:38:11,405 --> 00:38:12,429
Cat...

487
00:38:12,606 --> 00:38:14,096
Catatonic, sir.

488
00:38:15,009 --> 00:38:17,170
- He's not feeling very well.
- Yes.

489
00:38:19,313 --> 00:38:23,215
If you lot don't stop behaving like quivering
milkmaids, you're on double-time.

490
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:26,876
Now, you get down there
and you bring that coffin up now.

491
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:29,454
Good day, sir.

492
00:38:30,357 --> 00:38:32,052
Hello.

493
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,784
It's all right.

494
00:38:34,962 --> 00:38:36,657
I'm a doctor.

495
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,308
The man's in shock.
He may need a few moments.

496
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:54,137
The witness stated that he saw
Lord Blackwood rise from the grave.

497
00:38:54,481 --> 00:38:55,778
Well?

498
00:38:55,949 --> 00:38:59,077
- Well?
- You pronounced him dead.

499
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:01,744
He had no pulse.

500
00:39:06,593 --> 00:39:08,083
Ready.

501
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:10,419
Down.

502
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:23,933
Good Lord.

503
00:39:25,579 --> 00:39:27,069
That's not Blackwood.

504
00:39:28,782 --> 00:39:32,115
Well, now we have a firm grasp
of the obvious.

505
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:38,123
Time of death?

506
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:42,660
Diptera is...

507
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:45,327
approximately...

508
00:39:46,066 --> 00:39:49,058
2/3 of an inch
which would put the time of death...

509
00:39:49,236 --> 00:39:51,295
at between 10 and 12 hours ago.

510
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,769
May I borrow your pen?

511
00:39:58,379 --> 00:40:00,870
- Adler's dwarf.
- Midget.

512
00:40:10,657 --> 00:40:12,090
I know what I saw.

513
00:40:13,927 --> 00:40:15,292
It was Blackwood.

514
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,928
As clear as I see you.

515
00:40:20,734 --> 00:40:23,396
And when the dead walk...

516
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:27,171
the living will fill these coffins.

517
00:40:29,443 --> 00:40:31,004
Well...

518
00:40:35,549 --> 00:40:37,779
Right. Put the lid
on and clean this lot up.

519
00:40:37,951 --> 00:40:40,010
You really believe he was resurrected?

520
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:42,178
The question is not if, but how.

521
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,347
- The game's afoot.
- Follow your spirit...

522
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,220
And upon this charge, cry:

523
00:40:46,393 --> 00:40:49,760
"God for Harry, England and St. George."

524
00:40:52,332 --> 00:40:53,560
There you are.

525
00:40:53,834 --> 00:40:56,302
Why that certain chips stall,
I don't understand.

526
00:40:56,470 --> 00:41:00,668
There's a particular beer in their batter.
A northern stout, to be exact.

527
00:41:01,008 --> 00:41:04,637
You know, Holmes, I've seen
things in war I don't understand.

528
00:41:04,812 --> 00:41:07,110
I once met a man
who predicted his own death...

529
00:41:07,281 --> 00:41:09,613
right down to the number
and the placement...

530
00:41:09,783 --> 00:41:12,013
of the bullets that killed him.

531
00:41:12,186 --> 00:41:13,778
You have to admit, Holmes...

532
00:41:13,954 --> 00:41:16,582
that a supernatural explanation
to this case...

533
00:41:16,757 --> 00:41:18,884
is theoretically possible.

534
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:24,019
Well, agreed, but it's a huge mistake
to theorize before one has data.

535
00:41:24,198 --> 00:41:26,962
Inevitably one begins to twist facts
to suit theories...

536
00:41:27,134 --> 00:41:29,329
instead of theories to suit facts.

537
00:41:29,503 --> 00:41:33,405
That said, I believe Adler's midget
is the key to this.

538
00:41:35,042 --> 00:41:38,239
Right. Scratches around the keyhole
where the watch was wound.

539
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:41,006
- What does that tell you?
- The man was likely a drunk.

540
00:41:41,181 --> 00:41:44,582
Every time he wound the watch
his hand would slip, hence the scratches.

541
00:41:44,751 --> 00:41:45,775
Very good, Watson.

542
00:41:45,953 --> 00:41:49,250
You've developed considerable
deductive powers of your own.

543
00:41:49,823 --> 00:41:52,587
Le's see now, there are several
sets of initials scored...

544
00:41:52,759 --> 00:41:54,283
- Pawnbrokers' marks.
- Excellent.

545
00:41:54,461 --> 00:41:58,761
Most recent of which are "M. H."
M. H. M. H. Is for?

546
00:41:58,932 --> 00:42:01,457
- Maddison and Haig.
- Maddison and Haig.

547
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:07,570
They should be able to
give us an address.

548
00:42:11,578 --> 00:42:13,307
What a coincidence.

549
00:42:14,248 --> 00:42:16,944
There's one thing you've
failed to deduce from the watch.

550
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,516
Really? I think not.

551
00:42:18,685 --> 00:42:21,882
The time.
I have to get back, Holmes.

552
00:42:22,055 --> 00:42:23,955
Taking tea with the in-laws.

553
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:26,388
- Reckon your future, sir?
- Absolutely not.

554
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,085
- No, thank you.
- You need to hear what I have to tell.

555
00:42:29,263 --> 00:42:31,629
We have no need of your lucky heather,
gypsy woman.

556
00:42:31,798 --> 00:42:34,028
Even if it's to do with Mary?

557
00:42:40,607 --> 00:42:43,633
I see 2 men. Brothers.

558
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:45,607
Not in blood, but in bond.

559
00:42:49,783 --> 00:42:51,011
What of Mary?

560
00:42:51,184 --> 00:42:54,984
M for Mary, for marriage.
You will be married.

561
00:42:55,956 --> 00:42:57,150
Go on.

562
00:42:57,457 --> 00:43:00,517
I see patterned tablecloths...

563
00:43:00,694 --> 00:43:03,128
and China figurines...

564
00:43:03,297 --> 00:43:05,265
and lace doilies.

565
00:43:05,966 --> 00:43:06,990
Doilies.

566
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:10,659
Lace doilies? Holmes.

567
00:43:11,104 --> 00:43:14,096
Does your depravity know no bounds?

568
00:43:14,274 --> 00:43:16,105
- No.
- She turns to fat...

569
00:43:16,276 --> 00:43:18,107
and she has a beard and...

570
00:43:18,278 --> 00:43:20,439
- What of the warts?
- She's covered in warts.

571
00:43:20,614 --> 00:43:22,241
- Enough.
- Are they extensive?

572
00:43:22,416 --> 00:43:24,350
Please, enough.

573
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:28,688
It's the most apt prediction
Flora has made in years.

574
00:43:29,656 --> 00:43:32,216
And precisely the reason
you can't find a suitable ring.

575
00:43:32,392 --> 00:43:33,450
Do you have my money?

576
00:43:33,627 --> 00:43:36,152
You are terrified of a life
without the thrill of the macabre.

577
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:38,423
- Do you have my cut from the fight?
- Admit it.

578
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:40,692
- Give me my money! Holmes.
- Admit it!

579
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:44,401
I see.

580
00:43:50,577 --> 00:43:51,908
Thank you.

581
00:43:54,081 --> 00:43:57,676
Well, you've got your ring and I've got
my address for the ginger midget.

582
00:43:57,851 --> 00:44:01,343
- Should be just there.
- I think she'll really like this.

583
00:44:01,521 --> 00:44:05,287
And I have some change in my pocket.

584
00:44:09,162 --> 00:44:12,222
- Shall I look after it for you?
- No, no.

585
00:44:13,033 --> 00:44:14,967
- Don't give it away here.
- No.

586
00:44:15,135 --> 00:44:17,126
I have to go see Mary.

587
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:19,201
Give her my best.

588
00:44:20,107 --> 00:44:22,132
And her family, as well.

589
00:45:02,082 --> 00:45:04,243
It does make a considerable
difference to me...

590
00:45:04,418 --> 00:45:07,012
having someone with me
on whom I can thoroughly rely.

591
00:45:07,187 --> 00:45:10,679
Well, you can rely on me
for exactly 10 minutes.

592
00:45:12,759 --> 00:45:15,284
He clearly felt something
was coming to get him.

593
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:17,327
Something did.

594
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:20,061
Irene Adler was here.

595
00:45:20,267 --> 00:45:24,328
Either that or the ginger midget
wore the same Parisian perfume.

596
00:45:27,574 --> 00:45:29,608
Putrefaction.

597
00:45:34,247 --> 00:45:37,978
Ammonium sulfate, among other aromas.

598
00:45:42,055 --> 00:45:43,784
Phosphorous.

599
00:45:44,791 --> 00:45:46,452
Formaldehyde.

600
00:45:58,171 --> 00:46:00,332
It looks like...

601
00:46:01,141 --> 00:46:03,405
he was attempting to combine...

602
00:46:03,577 --> 00:46:06,944
some kind of sorcery
and scientific formula.

603
00:46:14,921 --> 00:46:16,821
More importantly...

604
00:46:17,424 --> 00:46:19,949
le's see what he was
trying to dispose of.

605
00:46:21,194 --> 00:46:23,754
- Potassium, magnesium.
- Sultaphytic acid.

606
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:27,889
I'll suck the iron right out of the ink
as long as it's not too burnt.

607
00:46:42,682 --> 00:46:44,206
Peculiar.

608
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:48,952
Hydrated rhododendron.

609
00:47:14,014 --> 00:47:15,544
Holmes.

610
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:17,883
Look at the crest.

611
00:47:19,052 --> 00:47:20,815
Reordan was working with Blackwood.

612
00:47:20,987 --> 00:47:22,716
Of course he was.

613
00:47:22,889 --> 00:47:25,187
The question is, to what end.

614
00:47:28,662 --> 00:47:32,428
Whatever he was working on,
he clearly succeeded.

615
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:33,896
How so?

616
00:47:34,067 --> 00:47:36,297
Otherwise, he'd still be alive.

617
00:47:36,469 --> 00:47:39,063
Which is why Miss Adler
is so desperate to find him.

618
00:47:39,739 --> 00:47:40,766
Yes.

619
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:42,932
There is one odor
I can't quite put my finger on.

620
00:47:43,609 --> 00:47:46,442
Is it candy floss? Molasses?

621
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:47,978
Maple syrup?

622
00:47:48,148 --> 00:47:49,240
Barley sugar.

623
00:47:49,416 --> 00:47:51,179
Toffee apple.

624
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:58,284
Let me guess.

625
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:00,551
Judging by your arsonist tool kit...

626
00:48:00,727 --> 00:48:04,686
you're here to burn down the building
and extinguish all evidence therein.

627
00:48:04,865 --> 00:48:07,095
Just one minute, boys.

628
00:48:07,767 --> 00:48:09,064
Dredger.

629
00:48:28,755 --> 00:48:30,086
Meat...

630
00:48:30,423 --> 00:48:31,617
or potatoes?

631
00:48:32,359 --> 00:48:34,020
My 10 minutes are up.

632
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:28,870
You all right?

633
00:50:44,724 --> 00:50:46,282
Holmes...

634
00:50:46,893 --> 00:50:48,224
what is that?

635
00:54:16,236 --> 00:54:17,567
Holmes!

636
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:12,691
Watson...

637
00:55:13,192 --> 00:55:15,319
what have you done?

638
00:55:26,506 --> 00:55:28,303
I haven't slept all night.

639
00:55:28,574 --> 00:55:30,474
Not a wink.

640
00:55:31,878 --> 00:55:34,312
Why I ever believed...

641
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:38,209
that I would get to have tea
with Mary's parents is beyond me...

642
00:55:38,384 --> 00:55:42,616
- having been talked into going with you.
- We were set upon. It was self-defense.

643
00:55:42,789 --> 00:55:47,021
I've been reviewing my notes
on our exploits over the last 7 months.

644
00:55:47,193 --> 00:55:48,990
Would you like to know my conclusion?

645
00:55:49,595 --> 00:55:52,496
- I am psychologically disturbed.
- How so?

646
00:55:52,665 --> 00:55:56,829
Why else would I continually be
led into situations...

647
00:55:57,003 --> 00:56:01,599
where you deliberately withhold
your plans from me? Why else?

648
00:56:02,408 --> 00:56:05,775
You've never complained
about my methods before.

649
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:08,209
- I'm not complaining.
- What do you call this?

650
00:56:08,381 --> 00:56:10,246
How am I complaining? I never complain.

651
00:56:10,416 --> 00:56:13,351
Do I complain about you practicing
the violin in the morning...

652
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:17,717
or your mess, your lack of hygiene,
or the fact that you steal my clothes?

653
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:19,084
We have a barter system.

654
00:56:19,258 --> 00:56:21,624
Do I complain
about you setting fire to my rooms?

655
00:56:21,794 --> 00:56:22,818
- Our rooms.
- The rooms.

656
00:56:22,995 --> 00:56:25,589
When do I complain
that you experiment on my dog?

657
00:56:25,765 --> 00:56:26,925
- Our dog.
- On the dog.

658
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,567
Gladstone is our dog.

659
00:56:28,735 --> 00:56:33,763
Where I do take issue is your campaign
to sabotage my relationship with Mary.

660
00:56:41,447 --> 00:56:42,846
I understand.

661
00:56:43,015 --> 00:56:44,710
- Do you?
- I do.

662
00:56:45,918 --> 00:56:48,352
- I don't think you do.
- You're overtired.

663
00:56:48,955 --> 00:56:50,479
- Yes.
- You're feeling sensitive.

664
00:56:50,656 --> 00:56:51,782
I'm not sensitive.

665
00:56:51,958 --> 00:56:54,188
What you need is a rest.

666
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:57,022
My brother, Mycroft,
has a small estate near Chichester.

667
00:56:57,196 --> 00:57:01,599
Beautiful grounds. There's a folly.
We can throw a lamb on the spit.

668
00:57:01,768 --> 00:57:05,568
We? Holmes, if I were to go to the country,
it would be with my future wife.

669
00:57:05,738 --> 00:57:08,832
- Well, certainly, if we must...
- No, not you. Mary and I.

670
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,771
- You are not...
- What, invited?

671
00:57:10,943 --> 00:57:13,571
Why would I not be invited
to my brother's country home?

672
00:57:13,746 --> 00:57:15,270
Now you're not making any sense.

673
00:57:15,448 --> 00:57:16,506
You're not human.

674
00:57:16,682 --> 00:57:17,979
John Watson?

675
00:57:19,419 --> 00:57:20,545
Yes.

676
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,517
Your bail's been posted.

677
00:57:28,428 --> 00:57:29,918
Mary.

678
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:35,260
Just Watson.

679
00:57:42,809 --> 00:57:46,506
I hope you get bail by breakfast,
because the boys are getting hungry.

680
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:53,045
Step lively.

681
00:57:56,823 --> 00:57:58,916
Back off. Back off.

682
00:57:59,091 --> 00:58:01,559
To which the barman says,
"May I push in your stool?"

683
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:06,660
Right, you, you're out.

684
00:58:07,834 --> 00:58:09,392
Until next time, Big Joe.

685
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:11,935
Always a pleasure, Mr. Holmes.

686
00:58:13,005 --> 00:58:15,633
Thank heaven you're here.
I'd almost run out of jokes.

687
00:58:15,808 --> 00:58:17,935
In another life,
you'd have made an excellent criminal.

688
00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:21,477
And you, sir, an excellent policeman.
Tomski, thank you.

689
00:58:22,615 --> 00:58:24,446
Now, please tell me you have answers.

690
00:58:24,617 --> 00:58:26,915
All in good time, Lestrade.

691
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:30,544
"All in good time"? Is this some parlor game
where we guess what you're thinking?

692
00:58:30,723 --> 00:58:33,954
I've got a public in frenzy out there.
If you don't fill me in...

693
00:58:34,126 --> 00:58:37,960
I'll have you in there playing Victoria
and Albert quicker than a bookie's runner.

694
00:58:38,297 --> 00:58:41,232
Now, clean up
and make yourself presentable.

695
00:58:41,534 --> 00:58:42,762
For whom?

696
00:58:42,935 --> 00:58:46,632
Friends in high places.
They're the ones who bailed you out.

697
00:58:57,383 --> 00:59:00,682
I'm terribly sorry
to inconvenience you, sir...

698
00:59:00,853 --> 00:59:03,253
but I'm gonna have to put this on you.

699
00:59:06,959 --> 00:59:11,453
Mr. Holmes,
apologies for summoning you like this.

700
00:59:11,797 --> 00:59:15,392
I'm sure it's quite a mystery
as to where you are and who I am.

701
00:59:15,668 --> 00:59:16,930
As to where I am...

702
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:21,306
I was, admittedly, lost for a moment
between Charing Cross and Holborn.

703
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:24,568
But I was saved by the bread shop
on Saffron Hill...

704
00:59:24,744 --> 00:59:28,271
the only baker to use a certain
French glaze on their loaves...

705
00:59:28,447 --> 00:59:29,709
a Brittany sage.

706
00:59:29,882 --> 00:59:34,615
The carriage forked left, then right,
a telltale bump over the Fleet Conduit.

707
00:59:34,787 --> 00:59:38,780
And as to who you are, that took every
ounce of my not inconsiderable experience.

708
00:59:38,958 --> 00:59:42,325
The letters on your desk are addressed
to Sir Thomas Rotheram.

709
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:44,895
Lord Chief Justice,
tha'd be your official title.

710
00:59:45,064 --> 00:59:48,659
Who you really are is, of course,
another matter entirely.

711
00:59:49,268 --> 00:59:51,168
Judging by the sacred ox on your ring...

712
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:53,862
you're the head of
the Temple of the Four Orders...

713
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,837
in whose headquarters we now sit...

714
00:59:56,008 --> 00:59:59,171
on the northwest corner
of St. James's Square, I think.

715
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:03,748
As to the mystery, the only mystery is
why you bothered to blindfold me at all.

716
01:00:06,018 --> 01:00:10,148
Yes, well, standard procedure,
I suppose.

717
01:00:11,991 --> 01:00:14,323
I daresay we have the right man,
gentlemen.

718
01:00:14,493 --> 01:00:17,257
Sherlock Holmes,
Ambassador Standish from America...

719
01:00:17,430 --> 01:00:19,364
and Lord Coward, the home secretary.

720
01:00:20,066 --> 01:00:23,866
I suppose you already have some notion
as to the practices of our order.

721
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:25,828
Yes.

722
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:29,368
They're practically interesting.

723
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:30,941
Be as skeptical as you like.

724
01:00:31,110 --> 01:00:34,568
But our secret systems have steered
the world towards good for centuries.

725
01:00:34,747 --> 01:00:38,148
The danger is they can also be used
for more nefarious purposes.

726
01:00:38,317 --> 01:00:41,115
What some call the dark arts,
or practical magic.

727
01:00:41,287 --> 01:00:44,848
We know you don't believe
in magic, Mr. Holmes.

728
01:00:45,024 --> 01:00:47,618
We don't expect you to share our faith...

729
01:00:47,793 --> 01:00:49,192
merely our fears.

730
01:00:49,362 --> 01:00:51,956
Fear is the more infectious condition.

731
01:00:52,131 --> 01:00:54,122
In this instance...

732
01:00:56,502 --> 01:00:58,231
fear of your own child.

733
01:01:01,507 --> 01:01:03,168
Blackwood is your son.

734
01:01:03,342 --> 01:01:06,800
You have the same irises,
a rare dark green...

735
01:01:06,979 --> 01:01:08,879
with diamond-shaped hazel flecks...

736
01:01:09,048 --> 01:01:13,075
together with identical outer ears, which
are only passed down through bloodline...

737
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:15,277
which makes you either brothers...

738
01:01:15,454 --> 01:01:18,184
or, in this case, more likely,
father and son.

739
01:01:23,496 --> 01:01:26,659
Very few people
are privy to that information...

740
01:01:26,832 --> 01:01:28,663
and we want to keep it that way.

741
01:01:33,472 --> 01:01:35,599
He was conceived
during one of our rituals.

742
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:37,174
His mother wasn't my wife...

743
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:39,574
but she shared our beliefs.

744
01:01:39,745 --> 01:01:41,906
She was a powerful practitioner...

745
01:01:42,081 --> 01:01:44,743
though not enough
to survive giving birth to him.

746
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:48,754
Death followed him wherever he went.

747
01:01:48,921 --> 01:01:51,355
Those 5 girls were not the first
to be butchered.

748
01:01:51,524 --> 01:01:54,687
He killed many more,
using them to enhance his powers.

749
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:58,457
No one could prove anything,
of course, but we all knew.

750
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:01,156
The boy was a curse.

751
01:02:01,333 --> 01:02:04,302
We've done our best to stop him,
but it's not enough.

752
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:05,869
His power grows daily.

753
01:02:06,038 --> 01:02:08,097
His resurrection is evidence of that.

754
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:10,802
But what he does next
will be more dangerous.

755
01:02:10,976 --> 01:02:15,436
His secret lies in the book of spells.
This is the source of his power.

756
01:02:16,048 --> 01:02:18,915
He's gonna raise a force
that will alter the course of world.

757
01:02:19,085 --> 01:02:21,883
We want you to find him
and stop him before he does.

758
01:02:22,755 --> 01:02:25,690
We'll give you any assistance
that we can.

759
01:02:26,792 --> 01:02:30,284
As home secretary, I have considerable
influence over the police.

760
01:02:30,763 --> 01:02:32,021
Yes.

761
01:02:33,766 --> 01:02:35,097
So...

762
01:02:36,936 --> 01:02:38,369
name your price.

763
01:02:38,537 --> 01:02:40,732
The benefit of being
a consulting detective...

764
01:02:40,906 --> 01:02:42,965
is that I can pick and choose
my clients.

765
01:02:43,809 --> 01:02:45,674
So consider it done, I'll stop him.

766
01:02:47,279 --> 01:02:49,110
But not for you.

767
01:02:49,281 --> 01:02:51,249
And certainly not for a price.

768
01:02:54,587 --> 01:02:58,079
- I do have a parting query, Sir Thomas.
- What is that?

769
01:02:58,257 --> 01:03:02,091
If the rest of his family's dead,
how long do you expect to survive?

770
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:04,587
Food for thought.

771
01:03:29,555 --> 01:03:33,013
Well, perhaps you'll have better luck
opening that.

772
01:03:33,592 --> 01:03:36,857
Margaux '58. A comet vintage.

773
01:03:37,463 --> 01:03:41,365
How fascinating that an astronomical event
can affect the quality...

774
01:03:41,534 --> 01:03:44,025
How is it going with our case
you refuse to take?

775
01:03:44,203 --> 01:03:45,534
Of the wine.

776
01:03:47,172 --> 01:03:49,641
I've hit a dead end, literally.

777
01:03:51,177 --> 01:03:52,701
I found your man.

778
01:03:52,878 --> 01:03:55,210
He's buried in Blackwood's tomb.

779
01:03:56,115 --> 01:03:57,480
If you still need him.

780
01:03:59,818 --> 01:04:01,249
Dear.

781
01:04:03,189 --> 01:04:06,386
Hope my client
doesn't come looking for a refund.

782
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:07,924
He's a professor, isn't he?

783
01:04:08,093 --> 01:04:10,994
Couldn't see his face,
but I spotted chalk on his lapel.

784
01:04:11,163 --> 01:04:15,429
I've never known a professor to carry a gun,
and on such a clever contraption.

785
01:04:19,471 --> 01:04:21,939
Eye patch, nice touch.

786
01:04:22,842 --> 01:04:24,901
So case closed...

787
01:04:25,077 --> 01:04:28,103
which makes this a social visit.

788
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:31,181
No, it's a "you're in over your head,
Irene" visit.

789
01:04:31,884 --> 01:04:34,375
Whoever killed Reordan
was covering their tracks...

790
01:04:34,553 --> 01:04:36,748
which makes you the next loose end
to be snipped.

791
01:04:38,824 --> 01:04:40,485
Let it breathe.

792
01:04:41,427 --> 01:04:43,554
I've never been in over my head.

793
01:04:43,729 --> 01:04:47,256
Leave now. Disappear.
You're good at that.

794
01:04:47,433 --> 01:04:51,529
Or stay and volunteer
for protective custody.

795
01:04:54,607 --> 01:04:58,134
If I'm in danger, so are you.

796
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:03,475
Come with me.

797
01:05:06,085 --> 01:05:07,780
What if we trusted each other?

798
01:05:09,712 --> 01:05:10,770
You're not listening.

799
01:05:10,947 --> 01:05:15,543
I'm taking you to either the railway station
or the police station.

800
01:05:27,397 --> 01:05:28,830
So...

801
01:05:32,168 --> 01:05:33,999
- Which is it to be?
- Careful.

802
01:05:35,905 --> 01:05:37,497
You decide.

803
01:05:37,674 --> 01:05:40,108
- Which will it be?
- What...?

804
01:05:40,710 --> 01:05:42,575
I told you to let it breathe.

805
01:05:43,379 --> 01:05:45,506
Can you taste the comet?

806
01:05:51,587 --> 01:05:54,954
Why couldn't you just
come away with me?

807
01:05:56,292 --> 01:05:58,055
Never.

808
01:07:44,731 --> 01:07:48,963
Madam, I need you to remain calm
and trust me, I'm a professional.

809
01:07:49,135 --> 01:07:51,626
But beneath this pillow
lies the key to my release.

810
01:07:52,939 --> 01:07:56,136
- She misinterpreted my intention entirely.
- Naturally, sir.

811
01:07:56,309 --> 01:07:59,073
That's why I find this modern
religious fervor so troubling.

812
01:07:59,245 --> 01:08:02,510
- No latitude for misunderstanding.
- Faith runs right over reason, sir.

813
01:08:02,682 --> 01:08:05,674
Indeed. And chambermaids
were once such a liberal breed.

814
01:08:05,852 --> 01:08:08,150
My wife's a chambermaid, sir.

815
01:08:10,256 --> 01:08:14,192
Anyhow, a good thing she was offended,
or we may never have found you.

816
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:18,091
The inspector's been over to Baker Street
himself this morning, sir.

817
01:08:21,901 --> 01:08:23,760
Just joking about the wife, sir.

818
01:08:28,541 --> 01:08:30,031
We've checked everything, sir.

819
01:08:30,209 --> 01:08:33,042
No sign of a break-in
and the butler didn't hear a thing.

820
01:08:33,212 --> 01:08:35,373
So body in the bathtub...

821
01:08:35,548 --> 01:08:39,780
his eyes were wide open,
and the only thing missing was...

822
01:08:40,787 --> 01:08:42,846
his ring, sir.

823
01:08:58,938 --> 01:09:00,633
Why did you drain the water?

824
01:09:00,807 --> 01:09:04,470
- Out of common decency.
- Crime is common, logic is rare.

825
01:09:04,644 --> 01:09:08,671
The decent thing to do is to catch the killer,
not provide comfort for the corpse.

826
01:09:23,363 --> 01:09:24,830
What is that?

827
01:09:28,434 --> 01:09:30,368
- Jasmine bath salts, sir.
- Superb.

828
01:09:30,536 --> 01:09:34,131
Probably comes from a larger container.
I'll either be in the pantry...

829
01:09:34,307 --> 01:09:38,004
high up where it's warm and dry,
or in a linen cupboard with a vent.

830
01:09:39,012 --> 01:09:40,502
Constable, you could do worse...

831
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:43,979
than to check the ground under
the rear windows for any footprints.

832
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:46,880
Data, data, data.
I cannot make bricks without clay.

833
01:10:46,179 --> 01:10:47,840
Mr. Holmes?

834
01:10:56,389 --> 01:10:58,653
Was it in the cupboard or the pantry?

835
01:10:58,825 --> 01:11:00,622
It was in the pantry, sir.

836
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:02,857
I don't know what to make of this.

837
01:11:03,029 --> 01:11:04,792
Excellent work.

838
01:11:04,964 --> 01:11:06,693
Adieu.

839
01:11:44,637 --> 01:11:48,129
What's the meaning of this, Coward?
Why have you called this meeting?

840
01:11:49,375 --> 01:11:50,603
Sir Thomas is dead.

841
01:11:52,812 --> 01:11:55,838
I nominate Lord Blackwood
as head of the order.

842
01:11:58,885 --> 01:12:00,876
Have you lost your mind?

843
01:12:01,053 --> 01:12:02,987
You know damn well
what he's capable of.

844
01:12:03,156 --> 01:12:05,056
Of course he does.

845
01:12:06,959 --> 01:12:08,790
That's why we're here.

846
01:12:10,329 --> 01:12:11,990
That's why we're all here.

847
01:12:18,037 --> 01:12:21,700
My powers and my assets
were given to me for one purpose.

848
01:12:22,074 --> 01:12:26,238
A magnificent but simple purpose.

849
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:29,439
To create a new future.

850
01:12:30,082 --> 01:12:33,518
A future ruled...

851
01:12:33,686 --> 01:12:35,449
by us.

852
01:12:37,423 --> 01:12:42,554
Tomorrow at noon, we take the first step
towards a new chapter in our history.

853
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:45,429
Magic will lead the way.

854
01:12:45,598 --> 01:12:48,032
Once the people of England
see our newfound power...

855
01:12:48,201 --> 01:12:50,135
they'll bow down in fear.

856
01:12:55,107 --> 01:12:58,907
Across the Atlantic
lies a colony that was once ours.

857
01:12:59,078 --> 01:13:00,409
It will be again.

858
01:13:01,314 --> 01:13:03,578
The Civil War has made them weak.

859
01:13:03,749 --> 01:13:08,550
Their government is as corrupt
and as ineffective as ours...

860
01:13:08,721 --> 01:13:10,951
so we'll take it back.

861
01:13:12,592 --> 01:13:14,958
We will remake the world...

862
01:13:16,662 --> 01:13:18,357
create the future.

863
01:13:19,665 --> 01:13:23,396
These men are with me, Standish...

864
01:13:23,569 --> 01:13:25,127
but...

865
01:13:25,404 --> 01:13:26,803
are you?

866
01:13:27,473 --> 01:13:30,169
No, sir. I am not.

867
01:13:31,177 --> 01:13:34,044
These powers that you're playing with...

868
01:13:34,213 --> 01:13:36,272
no man can control.

869
01:13:38,384 --> 01:13:40,181
Well, gentlemen...

870
01:13:41,687 --> 01:13:45,088
someone has to stop him,
even if you won't.

871
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:49,419
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

872
01:13:54,667 --> 01:13:56,658
Save me!

873
01:14:12,752 --> 01:14:14,413
Gentlemen...

874
01:14:14,587 --> 01:14:16,452
don't be afraid.

875
01:14:17,423 --> 01:14:19,254
As you can see...

876
01:14:20,526 --> 01:14:22,551
we are protected.

877
01:14:23,829 --> 01:14:26,320
Come, drink your allegiance here.

878
01:14:32,571 --> 01:14:36,337
You control the police, now use them.

879
01:14:48,087 --> 01:14:49,315
Didn't know you were here.

880
01:14:49,488 --> 01:14:52,753
Since this room is no longer yours,
do you mind if I utilize it?

881
01:14:54,126 --> 01:14:55,616
Be my guest.

882
01:14:57,129 --> 01:14:58,994
- In here, chaps.
- Where would you like me...

883
01:14:59,165 --> 01:15:01,599
- to put him, sir?
- Anywhere is fine.

884
01:15:12,178 --> 01:15:15,306
- Who is he?
- The man who tried to kill you at Reordan's.

885
01:15:15,481 --> 01:15:18,348
His neck didn't survive the impact
of Dredger landing on him.

886
01:15:19,051 --> 01:15:20,518
Yes.

887
01:15:21,187 --> 01:15:23,087
Thanks for that, by the way.

888
01:15:25,057 --> 01:15:29,585
There is consolation in the knowledge that
he could be of service to his fellow man.

889
01:15:33,566 --> 01:15:38,230
Elbows and arms stained with blood,
but it's older than his own injuries.

890
01:15:44,176 --> 01:15:46,201
None of it human.

891
01:15:47,113 --> 01:15:48,637
He's not a butcher, let me see.

892
01:15:58,791 --> 01:16:01,021
Yellow flame, green bursts.

893
01:16:01,627 --> 01:16:02,924
An industrial worker.

894
01:16:07,266 --> 01:16:08,563
Coal.

895
01:16:08,734 --> 01:16:10,361
River silt.

896
01:16:10,536 --> 01:16:12,936
The slag on his trousers
should put him squarely in...

897
01:16:13,105 --> 01:16:15,232
- Nine Elms.
- Sorry, what?

898
01:16:15,841 --> 01:16:18,071
The area you're looking for is Nine Elms.

899
01:16:18,244 --> 01:16:20,109
I wondered.

900
01:16:20,279 --> 01:16:23,612
Do you remember where I put
the Lords Register of members' interests?

901
01:16:23,783 --> 01:16:25,148
It's on the stepladder.

902
01:16:35,628 --> 01:16:40,122
Well, Blackwood's had his hand in just about
everything that's corrosive to the spirit.

903
01:16:40,733 --> 01:16:43,702
Woolwich Arsenal.
Limehouse Chemical Works.

904
01:16:43,869 --> 01:16:45,860
I'll probably be a factory by the river.

905
01:16:46,305 --> 01:16:47,795
What's that?

906
01:16:48,207 --> 01:16:49,697
Never mind.

907
01:16:51,544 --> 01:16:53,808
You don't know where
my rugby ball went, do you?

908
01:16:53,979 --> 01:16:55,310
No, not a clue.

909
01:16:55,481 --> 01:16:58,416
Queenshithe Slaughterhouse.

910
01:16:58,584 --> 01:16:59,983
Nine Elms.

911
01:17:00,152 --> 01:17:02,143
A factory by the river.

912
01:17:02,521 --> 01:17:05,456
Well done. That should lead us
to Blackwood, dead or alive.

913
01:17:06,058 --> 01:17:07,719
Not us.

914
01:17:09,562 --> 01:17:10,893
You.

915
01:17:11,363 --> 01:17:12,796
Yes.

916
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:16,430
Just a figure of speech, old boy.

917
01:17:25,544 --> 01:17:26,841
He's left it there on purpose.

918
01:17:47,366 --> 01:17:49,800
More coal, doctor.

919
01:17:54,273 --> 01:17:56,969
That's a good one. He's such a tit.

920
01:17:57,143 --> 01:17:58,667
God. Yeah.

921
01:17:58,844 --> 01:18:00,709
Glad to see you two
are working hard.

922
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:03,508
And I thought we were
trying to be discreet.

923
01:18:03,682 --> 01:18:07,516
You would not last one day in the navy.

924
01:18:09,889 --> 01:18:13,791
Are you sure there isn't an alternative
means of water transportation than that?

925
01:18:13,959 --> 01:18:17,554
I guarantee you nobody knows
London's waterways better.

926
01:18:17,796 --> 01:18:21,232
- Tanner's practically a fish himself.
- He certainly drinks like one.

927
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,527
You found a sense of humor, doctor.

928
01:18:23,702 --> 01:18:25,966
If only just a sense.

929
01:18:26,405 --> 01:18:30,307
I better take over, there.
Bit tricky down here.

930
01:18:51,463 --> 01:18:53,363
Come on, come on.

931
01:19:08,681 --> 01:19:10,205
- Look familiar?
- Yep.

932
01:19:10,382 --> 01:19:13,044
All that's missing is a ginger midget.

933
01:19:25,497 --> 01:19:27,988
They cleared something away from here
not minutes ago.

934
01:19:28,167 --> 01:19:29,725
Like what?

935
01:19:30,035 --> 01:19:33,095
Not sure. Something mechanical.

936
01:19:33,272 --> 01:19:34,899
Holmes.

937
01:19:35,541 --> 01:19:37,270
Look at this.

938
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,061
- 1:18.
- Chapter and verse.

939
01:20:03,235 --> 01:20:06,966
Revelations 1:18.
"I am he that liveth, and was dead."

940
01:20:07,406 --> 01:20:10,398
"And behold, I'm alive for evermore."

941
01:20:11,543 --> 01:20:15,411
I warned you, Holmes, to accept
that this was beyond your control...

942
01:20:15,581 --> 01:20:18,448
beyond what your rational mind
could comprehend.

943
01:20:20,052 --> 01:20:24,011
- What a busy afterlife you're having.
- I want you to bear witness.

944
01:20:24,623 --> 01:20:29,083
Tomorrow, at midday,
the world as you know it will end.

945
01:20:29,261 --> 01:20:31,661
Show me your face,
i'll be the end of your world.

946
01:20:31,830 --> 01:20:33,798
Save your bullets, Watson.

947
01:20:34,233 --> 01:20:35,461
A gift for you.

948
01:20:40,839 --> 01:20:42,932
What was that about saving bullets?

949
01:20:49,281 --> 01:20:51,647
She followed you here, Holmes.

950
01:20:53,652 --> 01:20:56,553
You led your lamb to slaughter.

951
01:20:59,491 --> 01:21:00,890
Holmes.

952
01:21:02,461 --> 01:21:04,224
This game was designed to hurt.

953
01:21:15,974 --> 01:21:17,305
Watson!

954
01:21:21,547 --> 01:21:22,741
It's warm in here, Watson.

955
01:21:30,055 --> 01:21:31,579
In over your head yet, darling?

956
01:21:39,498 --> 01:21:41,193
- Hold on there.
- I can't.

957
01:21:41,367 --> 01:21:43,028
Let me take your weight.

958
01:21:44,169 --> 01:21:45,966
Give us a leg up, old boy.

959
01:21:48,474 --> 01:21:50,271
These German locks
always give me trouble.

960
01:21:56,014 --> 01:21:57,504
It's a band saw.

961
01:22:00,953 --> 01:22:02,944
No matter, we have plenty of time.

962
01:22:04,656 --> 01:22:05,987
Holmes.

963
01:22:14,099 --> 01:22:16,124
- It's not working.
- Keep calm.

964
01:22:24,243 --> 01:22:26,074
Holmes, hurry up.

965
01:22:33,619 --> 01:22:36,486
Don't get excited. Turn off that valve.

966
01:23:01,580 --> 01:23:03,571
And we'll bounce in 3, 2...

967
01:23:04,983 --> 01:23:06,143
1.

968
01:23:16,762 --> 01:23:18,354
Thank you.

969
01:23:18,831 --> 01:23:20,526
I'm gonna get after Blackwood.

970
01:23:30,409 --> 01:23:31,808
Thank you.

971
01:23:32,244 --> 01:23:34,838
We should help the doctor.

972
01:23:46,291 --> 01:23:47,952
Holmes!

973
01:25:19,718 --> 01:25:21,515
Mr. Holmes.

974
01:25:23,555 --> 01:25:24,988
Sir.

975
01:25:28,527 --> 01:25:30,427
Mr. Holmes.

976
01:25:39,137 --> 01:25:43,005
Mr. Holmes, we have an order
for your arrest, sir.

977
01:25:46,979 --> 01:25:48,071
Sir!

978
01:25:48,246 --> 01:25:51,909
Lord Coward has issued a warrant
for your arrest, sir.

979
01:25:53,218 --> 01:25:54,708
Now, Watson's alive.

980
01:25:54,886 --> 01:25:57,787
Just get out of here, sir. Go, sir, go.

981
01:26:14,039 --> 01:26:15,939
Will the train be departing on time?

982
01:26:16,108 --> 01:26:18,406
The train's been delayed, madam.

983
01:26:18,577 --> 01:26:20,602
Shouldn't be long now, though.

984
01:26:36,928 --> 01:26:40,523
The train will depart when I tell it to.

985
01:26:42,167 --> 01:26:45,466
And you will leave my employment
when I allow you to.

986
01:26:49,808 --> 01:26:52,140
I fulfilled my contract.

987
01:26:52,310 --> 01:26:53,572
I found Reordan.

988
01:26:53,745 --> 01:26:55,906
He's in Scotland Yard's mortuary.

989
01:26:56,081 --> 01:26:57,912
So that's me, finished.

990
01:26:58,083 --> 01:27:01,951
Your job was to manipulate
Holmes' feelings for you...

991
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:03,678
not succumb to them.

992
01:27:06,591 --> 01:27:08,388
You have fulfilled nothing.

993
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:11,256
I want what Reordan was making
for Blackwood.

994
01:27:11,863 --> 01:27:15,424
Finish the job or the next dead body...

995
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:18,194
will be Sherlock Holmes.

996
01:27:44,830 --> 01:27:46,798
The surgeon should be along shortly.

997
01:27:51,636 --> 01:27:53,968
He should be able to rest now.

998
01:27:57,075 --> 01:27:58,565
Excuse me.

999
01:28:02,581 --> 01:28:04,276
Is that the best you can do?

1000
01:28:04,449 --> 01:28:06,314
Yes, for now.

1001
01:28:06,485 --> 01:28:08,578
I must attend to my other patients.

1002
01:28:10,622 --> 01:28:12,021
Doctor.

1003
01:28:12,491 --> 01:28:13,818
Doctor.

1004
01:28:14,593 --> 01:28:15,920
Please.

1005
01:28:19,898 --> 01:28:23,163
I know that you care for him
as much as I do.

1006
01:28:23,335 --> 01:28:26,736
This is not your responsibility,
it was his choice.

1007
01:28:27,706 --> 01:28:30,675
He'd say that it was worth the wounds.

1008
01:28:37,282 --> 01:28:39,147
Solve this.

1009
01:28:39,985 --> 01:28:42,010
Whatever it takes.

1010
01:28:52,297 --> 01:28:54,162
This is beyond your control.

1011
01:28:54,332 --> 01:28:55,959
Sheer bloody panic, sir. Panic.

1012
01:28:56,134 --> 01:28:58,932
- It's Lord Blackwood, sir.
- I've never been in over my head.

1013
01:28:59,104 --> 01:29:02,972
It's nothing to do with me,
but I advise you leave the case alone.

1014
01:29:03,141 --> 01:29:04,802
- Solve this.
- Are you, Holmes?

1015
01:29:04,976 --> 01:29:06,967
Accept that this was beyond your control.

1016
01:29:07,145 --> 01:29:10,478
- Tomorrow, at midday, the world will end.
- I've got a public in frenzy.

1017
01:29:10,649 --> 01:29:11,980
Holmes!

1018
01:29:33,038 --> 01:29:34,665
Widen your gaze.

1019
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:37,365
You must widen your gaze.
Widen your gaze.

1020
01:29:37,542 --> 01:29:41,979
You and I are bound together on a journey
that will twist the very fabric of nature.

1021
01:29:42,147 --> 01:29:44,240
Steel your mind, Holmes.
Widen your gaze.

1022
01:29:44,416 --> 01:29:46,816
He's gonna raise a force
that will alter the world.

1023
01:29:46,985 --> 01:29:49,852
- His power grows daily.
- This is the source of his power.

1024
01:29:50,021 --> 01:29:51,010
I need you.

1025
01:29:51,189 --> 01:29:53,714
His secret lies in the book of spells.

1026
01:30:21,019 --> 01:30:23,817
3 more will die...

1027
01:30:24,422 --> 01:30:27,220
and there is nothing you can do
to save them.

1028
01:30:27,893 --> 01:30:30,259
We know you don't believe in magic.

1029
01:30:31,429 --> 01:30:33,158
Reordan was working with Blackwood.

1030
01:30:33,331 --> 01:30:34,355
Is that better?

1031
01:30:34,532 --> 01:30:37,000
He clearly felt something
was coming to get him.

1032
01:30:38,236 --> 01:30:42,104
His eyes were wide open
and the only thing missing was his ring.

1033
01:30:49,214 --> 01:30:51,114
Give up, Holmes.

1034
01:30:53,418 --> 01:30:55,818
This is a riddle you cannot solve.

1035
01:31:02,093 --> 01:31:03,321
Good morning.

1036
01:31:06,898 --> 01:31:09,958
Now, you need to work.

1037
01:31:10,869 --> 01:31:12,097
Familiar artwork.

1038
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:16,468
You look gorgeous.

1039
01:31:19,577 --> 01:31:21,943
Somehow I knew you wouldn't leave.

1040
01:31:29,854 --> 01:31:31,321
You made the front page.

1041
01:31:31,756 --> 01:31:33,451
Only a name and no picture.

1042
01:31:34,826 --> 01:31:38,785
So it looks like you'll be needing to
work outside the law now...

1043
01:31:38,964 --> 01:31:41,023
and that's my area of expertise.

1044
01:31:41,199 --> 01:31:43,133
I feel safer already.

1045
01:31:45,537 --> 01:31:47,732
You seem to be making a rapid recovery.

1046
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:50,632
Yes.

1047
01:31:50,875 --> 01:31:53,343
Took the shrapnel out myself.

1048
01:31:53,511 --> 01:31:56,378
Mary said I had a lousy doctor.

1049
01:32:01,619 --> 01:32:03,109
Well, I'm...

1050
01:32:03,555 --> 01:32:05,079
I'm just so...

1051
01:32:05,256 --> 01:32:06,814
very glad that you're...

1052
01:32:06,992 --> 01:32:08,391
well...

1053
01:32:08,827 --> 01:32:10,294
with us.

1054
01:32:14,466 --> 01:32:18,800
Now that you're sitting comfortably,
I shall begin.

1055
01:32:19,304 --> 01:32:22,330
My initial approach was far too narrow.

1056
01:32:22,507 --> 01:32:24,975
When Blackwood invited me
to Pentonville Prison...

1057
01:32:25,143 --> 01:32:28,544
he suggested I widen my gaze
and, at minimum, I have done just that.

1058
01:32:28,713 --> 01:32:33,741
In fact, I may well have reconciled
thousands of years of theological disparity.

1059
01:32:35,086 --> 01:32:37,384
But that's for another time.

1060
01:32:37,555 --> 01:32:40,718
Blackwood's method is based on
a ritualistic mystical system...

1061
01:32:40,892 --> 01:32:44,191
that's been employed by the
Temple of the Four Orders for centuries.

1062
01:32:44,362 --> 01:32:47,456
To fully understand the system,
to get inside it...

1063
01:32:47,632 --> 01:32:51,159
I reenacted the ceremony
we interrupted at the crypt...

1064
01:32:51,336 --> 01:32:53,270
with a few enhancements of my own.

1065
01:32:54,205 --> 01:32:58,232
My journey took me somewhat further down
the rabbit hole than I had intended...

1066
01:32:58,410 --> 01:33:02,904
and though I dirtied my fluffy white tail,
I have emerged enlightened.

1067
01:33:04,215 --> 01:33:06,740
The fraternity who silently control
the empire...

1068
01:33:06,918 --> 01:33:10,115
share the belief with the kings,
pharaohs and emperors of old...

1069
01:33:10,288 --> 01:33:13,052
that the sphinx was a door
to another dimension...

1070
01:33:13,224 --> 01:33:15,317
a gateway to immeasurable power.

1071
01:33:15,493 --> 01:33:19,224
It's made up of 4 parts:
The foot of a lion, the tail of an ox...

1072
01:33:19,397 --> 01:33:21,763
the wings of an eagle,
and the head of a man.

1073
01:33:22,567 --> 01:33:25,502
In Sir Thomas's secret chamber,
I found the bone of an ox...

1074
01:33:25,670 --> 01:33:28,730
the tooth of a lion, the feather of an eagle
and hair of a man.

1075
01:33:28,907 --> 01:33:30,272
Map.

1076
01:33:34,112 --> 01:33:36,979
The points of the star represent
the 5 murdered girls...

1077
01:33:37,148 --> 01:33:40,083
but the cross
is what we're now interested in.

1078
01:33:40,351 --> 01:33:41,648
It's a widely held belief...

1079
01:33:41,820 --> 01:33:45,187
that within the architecture
of the great cities...

1080
01:33:45,356 --> 01:33:48,086
are coded references to this system.

1081
01:33:48,259 --> 01:33:51,251
Since he rose from the grave,
Blackwood has killed 3 men...

1082
01:33:51,429 --> 01:33:54,921
each committed at a location
that has a connection with the temple...

1083
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:56,465
therefore the system.

1084
01:33:58,269 --> 01:34:00,464
Reordan, the ginger midget,
represents man.

1085
01:34:00,638 --> 01:34:02,629
We found his body here.

1086
01:34:03,274 --> 01:34:06,471
Sir Thomas, master of the temple,
wore the ox ring.

1087
01:34:07,445 --> 01:34:08,969
He died here.

1088
01:34:09,848 --> 01:34:11,440
Standish, ambassador to America...

1089
01:34:11,616 --> 01:34:14,744
where the eagle has been
the national emblem for over 100 years.

1090
01:34:14,919 --> 01:34:18,980
The headquarters of the Temple
of the Four Orders where he died...

1091
01:34:19,157 --> 01:34:21,421
is here.

1092
01:34:22,093 --> 01:34:25,426
Correspondingly, the map will tell us
the location of Blackwood's final act.

1093
01:34:25,597 --> 01:34:28,430
So we have man, the ox, eagle.

1094
01:34:29,334 --> 01:34:30,494
Only the lion remaining.

1095
01:34:30,668 --> 01:34:31,828
Right here.

1096
01:34:34,506 --> 01:34:35,666
Parliament.

1097
01:34:40,545 --> 01:34:41,978
Right.

1098
01:34:42,147 --> 01:34:45,708
You 4 stay here and the rest
of you come with me.

1099
01:34:45,884 --> 01:34:48,751
- Get out of the way, you lowlifes!
- Right this way.

1100
01:34:52,223 --> 01:34:54,020
Ladies first.

1101
01:34:54,192 --> 01:34:55,716
Now.

1102
01:34:56,661 --> 01:34:57,958
Follow these instructions.

1103
01:34:58,129 --> 01:34:59,653
- Aren't you...?
- Go.

1104
01:35:03,301 --> 01:35:05,462
Hello, hello, hello.

1105
01:35:06,104 --> 01:35:08,231
Did the devil turn up?

1106
01:35:09,474 --> 01:35:10,839
Well...

1107
01:35:11,209 --> 01:35:12,904
never mind.

1108
01:35:13,411 --> 01:35:15,140
You got the next best thing.

1109
01:35:38,403 --> 01:35:42,737
Beg your pardon, my Lord.
I know that it's unorthodox...

1110
01:35:43,942 --> 01:35:45,432
but Mr. Holmes here...

1111
01:35:45,610 --> 01:35:49,273
he's been making some
serious accusations about you...

1112
01:35:50,481 --> 01:35:52,005
and the order.

1113
01:35:54,052 --> 01:35:55,110
I see.

1114
01:35:55,286 --> 01:35:59,450
Well, at least that solves the great mystery
as to how you became inspector.

1115
01:36:04,762 --> 01:36:06,730
Excuse me, my Lord...

1116
01:36:07,265 --> 01:36:09,790
but I've been wanting to do that
for a long time.

1117
01:36:09,968 --> 01:36:13,631
Well, inspector, I have 5 minutes
before my next engagement...

1118
01:36:14,239 --> 01:36:17,640
so why don't you regale me
with your stories of conspiracy?

1119
01:36:20,712 --> 01:36:22,202
Thank you, Lestrade.

1120
01:36:22,714 --> 01:36:24,272
My Lord.

1121
01:36:30,121 --> 01:36:33,249
I'm curious, Coward. Did you assist
Blackwood in all the murders...

1122
01:36:33,491 --> 01:36:35,425
or just the one I prevented?

1123
01:36:36,594 --> 01:36:39,062
Very distinctive,
those handmade shoes of yours.

1124
01:36:41,499 --> 01:36:46,368
But the price of quality
is often the unique imprint they leave.

1125
01:36:47,338 --> 01:36:50,501
Nonetheless, I confess to being
completely outmatched.

1126
01:36:51,242 --> 01:36:53,938
I could deduce very little
from my investigation.

1127
01:36:55,313 --> 01:36:57,508
Fortunately,
there's nothing more stimulating...

1128
01:36:57,682 --> 01:37:00,014
than a case where everything
goes against you.

1129
01:37:00,652 --> 01:37:04,179
How many members of Parliament
do you intend to murder at noon today?

1130
01:37:04,355 --> 01:37:05,947
Man, ox, eagle, lion.

1131
01:37:06,858 --> 01:37:08,416
The lion is Parliament, isn't it?

1132
01:37:11,496 --> 01:37:13,225
Very clever.

1133
01:37:13,631 --> 01:37:16,156
But it's not murder, Mr. Holmes.

1134
01:37:16,334 --> 01:37:17,995
It's mercy.

1135
01:37:18,169 --> 01:37:20,660
We are giving the weak masses
a strong shepherd.

1136
01:37:20,838 --> 01:37:23,306
Don't you see that it's for their own?

1137
01:37:26,110 --> 01:37:28,806
No, but I don't care much what you think.

1138
01:37:28,980 --> 01:37:31,881
I simply wanted to know the location
of Blackwood's ceremony...

1139
01:37:32,050 --> 01:37:33,449
and you've given it to me.

1140
01:37:33,618 --> 01:37:34,812
I've told you nothing.

1141
01:37:35,420 --> 01:37:38,685
But your clothes say infinitely
more than you could ever hope.

1142
01:37:38,856 --> 01:37:41,620
The mud on your boots
from where you've been walking.

1143
01:37:42,226 --> 01:37:45,559
A touch of red brick dust on your knee
from where you've been kneeling.

1144
01:37:46,831 --> 01:37:50,062
A small bandage on your thumb
from where you've been vowing.

1145
01:37:50,234 --> 01:37:54,193
A faint aroma of excrement
from where you've been standing.

1146
01:37:56,474 --> 01:37:59,238
You and Blackwood laid the final touches
to your ceremony...

1147
01:37:59,410 --> 01:38:02,470
in the sewers beneath Parliament
less than an hour ago.

1148
01:38:03,581 --> 01:38:05,549
Both houses meet today.

1149
01:38:06,150 --> 01:38:08,141
The whole government will be present.

1150
01:38:17,528 --> 01:38:20,827
It's a shame you made an enemy
out of Blackwood, Holmes.

1151
01:38:21,532 --> 01:38:23,329
You would have made a valuable ally.

1152
01:38:30,775 --> 01:38:32,675
How terrible is wisdom...

1153
01:38:32,844 --> 01:38:35,711
when it brings no profit to the wise.

1154
01:38:36,447 --> 01:38:37,914
We take power at noon.

1155
01:38:38,916 --> 01:38:41,248
There isn't any time to waste then,
is there?

1156
01:39:08,146 --> 01:39:10,376
I told you he'd be coming
out the top window.

1157
01:39:10,548 --> 01:39:13,039
There isn't any way
he'd be coming over that terrace.

1158
01:39:13,217 --> 01:39:16,050
Technically, that isn't the top window,
is it, sailor boy?

1159
01:39:16,220 --> 01:39:18,711
- What is it?
- Well, it's the middle window.

1160
01:39:18,890 --> 01:39:20,050
Anyway.

1161
01:39:21,125 --> 01:39:23,719
You'll be pleased to know
Lestrade performed perfectly.

1162
01:39:23,895 --> 01:39:25,556
In fact, I think he enjoyed it.

1163
01:39:25,730 --> 01:39:27,425
I hope you know what you're doing.

1164
01:39:28,166 --> 01:39:29,793
Here's the key.

1165
01:39:29,967 --> 01:39:33,835
- You got all you needed from Coward?
- Yes, I smoked him out with relative ease.

1166
01:39:35,206 --> 01:39:36,230
- Tanner?
- Sir?

1167
01:39:36,407 --> 01:39:37,635
If you would, captain...

1168
01:39:37,809 --> 01:39:40,642
take us under the bridge,
port side, 100 yards.

1169
01:39:40,812 --> 01:39:44,179
Beyond that you'll find the tunnel
that leads us to the sewers.

1170
01:39:44,348 --> 01:39:45,747
Right away, sir.

1171
01:39:52,523 --> 01:39:54,388
The end is nigh.

1172
01:39:54,559 --> 01:39:58,859
Blackwood's come back from hell
and laid a curse upon this land.

1173
01:39:59,030 --> 01:40:02,625
He walks in every shadow
and every puff of smoke.

1174
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:05,462
Behold, he cometh with clouds...

1175
01:40:05,636 --> 01:40:08,469
and every eye shall see him...

1176
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:12,234
and every soul shall wail
because of him.

1177
01:40:12,410 --> 01:40:15,402
You cannot stop him!
No one can!

1178
01:40:45,443 --> 01:40:47,911
Behold, Blackwood's magic revealed.

1179
01:40:48,079 --> 01:40:50,411
- What does it do?
- It's a chemical weapon.

1180
01:40:51,182 --> 01:40:52,308
The first of its kind.

1181
01:40:52,483 --> 01:40:54,451
You deduced that how?

1182
01:40:54,619 --> 01:40:56,348
From my pocket.

1183
01:40:56,521 --> 01:40:59,513
I snipped this off a rather recumbent rat
at the slaughterhouse.

1184
01:40:59,690 --> 01:41:02,818
Note the blue discoloration,
the faint smell of bitter almonds.

1185
01:41:02,994 --> 01:41:05,087
- Telltale traces of cyanide.
- Cyanide.

1186
01:41:09,867 --> 01:41:12,199
Now we know what the
ginger midget was working on.

1187
01:41:12,370 --> 01:41:14,270
I'll revolutionize warfare.

1188
01:41:14,438 --> 01:41:15,962
Yes, killing a lot of people.

1189
01:41:16,140 --> 01:41:18,734
Now, it's 7 minutes to noon.
What are we gonna do?

1190
01:41:20,244 --> 01:41:21,905
Right. How many men
did you count on the...?

1191
01:41:25,516 --> 01:41:27,541
She loves an entrance, your muse.

1192
01:41:58,349 --> 01:41:59,646
Woman!

1193
01:42:00,751 --> 01:42:02,651
Shoot him. Now, please.

1194
01:42:15,032 --> 01:42:16,056
My lords.

1195
01:42:16,701 --> 01:42:17,725
My lords.

1196
01:42:18,169 --> 01:42:19,761
My lords.

1197
01:42:20,738 --> 01:42:22,000
The time has come...

1198
01:42:22,173 --> 01:42:24,471
for only those who believe to remain.

1199
01:42:26,344 --> 01:42:27,606
Behold...

1200
01:42:27,778 --> 01:42:29,678
Lord Blackwood.

1201
01:42:42,627 --> 01:42:44,288
You seem surprised.

1202
01:42:46,998 --> 01:42:50,434
I have returned from beyond the grave
to fulfill England's destiny...

1203
01:42:51,602 --> 01:42:55,368
and extend the boundaries
of this great empire.

1204
01:42:58,009 --> 01:42:59,977
Listen to the rabble outside.

1205
01:43:00,645 --> 01:43:02,135
Listen...

1206
01:43:02,313 --> 01:43:03,678
to the fear.

1207
01:43:04,315 --> 01:43:05,976
I will use that as a weapon...

1208
01:43:06,150 --> 01:43:08,084
to control them...

1209
01:43:08,586 --> 01:43:09,814
and then the world.

1210
01:43:14,225 --> 01:43:16,489
I've never seen anything like it.
Look at this.

1211
01:43:20,131 --> 01:43:23,123
Specifically designed
to prevent us from disarming it.

1212
01:43:25,803 --> 01:43:28,670
These appear to be designed
to receive a signal of some sort.

1213
01:43:28,839 --> 01:43:30,033
Electromagnetic waves?

1214
01:43:30,207 --> 01:43:31,902
When triggered, the electrodes...

1215
01:43:32,076 --> 01:43:34,636
will send a charge
converting the chemical into gas.

1216
01:43:34,812 --> 01:43:38,680
The gas will travel up that shaft
and filter through the ventilation system...

1217
01:43:38,849 --> 01:43:41,477
that leads directly to Parliament.
Within seconds...

1218
01:43:41,652 --> 01:43:44,746
the most powerful men in the world
will be choking on death.

1219
01:43:44,922 --> 01:43:48,221
Blackwood must have some transmitter
that he can activate remotely.

1220
01:43:48,392 --> 01:43:50,223
3 minutes, 10 seconds.

1221
01:43:50,661 --> 01:43:54,757
I will create an empire
that will endure for millennia...

1222
01:43:55,366 --> 01:43:56,993
indestructible...

1223
01:43:57,168 --> 01:43:58,396
and eternal.

1224
01:43:59,003 --> 01:44:00,834
Move it. Move it.

1225
01:44:01,272 --> 01:44:03,763
We don't actually have to
disarm the device...

1226
01:44:03,941 --> 01:44:07,468
we just have to remove the cylinders.

1227
01:44:07,645 --> 01:44:10,580
Yes, except that they're welded in.

1228
01:44:10,748 --> 01:44:13,876
What we need is a controlled explosion.

1229
01:44:14,051 --> 01:44:17,748
We'll need a container to direct the blast.
My clay pipe should service that ambition.

1230
01:44:38,409 --> 01:44:41,037
I rather wish you hadn't done that,
Irene.

1231
01:44:47,351 --> 01:44:52,345
On the 12th chime,
I will summon the dark powers.

1232
01:44:52,923 --> 01:44:57,257
All those of you who are with me
shall be protected.

1233
01:44:57,428 --> 01:44:58,486
All others...

1234
01:44:58,662 --> 01:44:59,993
will perish.

1235
01:45:07,238 --> 01:45:08,899
I need your pipe.

1236
01:45:12,576 --> 01:45:13,975
Nut him!

1237
01:45:39,270 --> 01:45:40,703
- Right.
- What?

1238
01:45:40,871 --> 01:45:42,498
- Coat.
- Got it.

1239
01:46:20,744 --> 01:46:22,006
The new order...

1240
01:46:23,480 --> 01:46:24,572
begins now.

1241
01:46:30,721 --> 01:46:31,745
Woman.

1242
01:46:32,590 --> 01:46:34,182
What are you waiting for?

1243
01:46:37,061 --> 01:46:38,289
That.

1244
01:46:49,607 --> 01:46:51,268
Apprehend Lord Coward.

1245
01:46:53,844 --> 01:46:55,709
- Can you manage?
- Course I can.

1246
01:47:22,740 --> 01:47:24,173
Relax...

1247
01:47:24,341 --> 01:47:25,365
I'm a doctor.

1248
01:48:37,548 --> 01:48:39,948
Did you take a wrong turning
somewhere?

1249
01:48:41,986 --> 01:48:43,214
We're safe now.

1250
01:48:44,254 --> 01:48:45,516
Interesting assessment.

1251
01:48:48,092 --> 01:48:49,753
Run off.

1252
01:48:51,996 --> 01:48:53,793
I won't be chasing you anymore.

1253
01:48:55,366 --> 01:48:57,231
Fare thee well.

1254
01:49:02,406 --> 01:49:04,374
I don't want to run anymore.

1255
01:49:07,277 --> 01:49:09,745
- I'll tell you everything.
- I wish you would.

1256
01:49:33,904 --> 01:49:35,098
No!

1257
01:50:40,938 --> 01:50:42,405
There was never any magic.

1258
01:50:44,675 --> 01:50:46,165
Only conjuring tricks.

1259
01:50:50,781 --> 01:50:52,772
The simplest involved
paying people off...

1260
01:50:52,950 --> 01:50:56,215
like the guard who pretended
to be possessed outside your cell.

1261
01:50:56,386 --> 01:50:58,911
Your reputation
and the inmates' fear did the rest.

1262
01:51:00,491 --> 01:51:03,016
Others required
more elaborate preparations...

1263
01:51:03,193 --> 01:51:06,458
like the sandstone slab
that covered your tomb.

1264
01:51:07,431 --> 01:51:11,390
You had it broken before your burial,
then put back together using an adhesive.

1265
01:51:12,736 --> 01:51:15,204
An ancient Egyptian recipe, I believe...

1266
01:51:15,372 --> 01:51:17,431
a mixture of egg and honey...

1267
01:51:18,108 --> 01:51:20,372
designed to be washed away
by the rain.

1268
01:51:25,382 --> 01:51:26,713
Holmes!

1269
01:51:26,884 --> 01:51:29,614
Arranging for your father
to drown in his own bathtub...

1270
01:51:29,786 --> 01:51:31,617
required more modern science.

1271
01:51:31,788 --> 01:51:34,723
Very clever of Reordan
to find a paralytic...

1272
01:51:34,892 --> 01:51:37,884
that was activated by the combination
of copper and water...

1273
01:51:38,061 --> 01:51:41,394
and was therefore undetectable
once the bath water was drained.

1274
01:51:42,232 --> 01:51:44,223
That migh've been a challenge for me...

1275
01:51:44,401 --> 01:51:47,962
had he not also tested it
on some unfortunate amphibians.

1276
01:51:52,643 --> 01:51:55,737
The death of Standish
was a real mystery...

1277
01:51:55,913 --> 01:51:58,973
until you used the same compound
to blow up the wharf.

1278
01:52:00,317 --> 01:52:02,751
An odorless, tasteless flammable liquid...

1279
01:52:03,353 --> 01:52:05,480
yet it burned
with an unusual pinkish hue.

1280
01:52:07,591 --> 01:52:10,890
Did Standish mistake it for rain
as he entered the temple?

1281
01:52:12,062 --> 01:52:13,529
All it took was a spark.

1282
01:52:18,001 --> 01:52:20,196
A simple rigged bullet in his gun.

1283
01:52:21,672 --> 01:52:23,105
Ingenious.

1284
01:52:23,273 --> 01:52:26,709
Like all great performers, you saved
your picce de rsistance for the end:

1285
01:52:26,877 --> 01:52:31,678
A chemical weapon distilled from cyanide
and refined in the bellies of swine.

1286
01:52:31,848 --> 01:52:33,372
Had it worked...

1287
01:52:33,550 --> 01:52:36,451
your followers in Parliament
would have watched unharmed...

1288
01:52:36,620 --> 01:52:39,111
as their colleagues
were dying around them.

1289
01:52:39,289 --> 01:52:41,280
They didn't know
you'd given them the antidote.

1290
01:52:41,458 --> 01:52:43,858
Instead,
they would've believed it was magic...

1291
01:52:44,027 --> 01:52:46,723
and that you'd harnessed
the ultimate power.

1292
01:52:47,064 --> 01:52:50,761
And the world would've followed,
fear being the most powerful weapon of all.

1293
01:52:52,736 --> 01:52:55,637
You'd better hope
that it's nothing more than superstition...

1294
01:52:55,806 --> 01:52:57,967
as you performed
all the rituals perfectly.

1295
01:52:58,775 --> 01:53:00,743
The devil is due a soul, I'd say.

1296
01:53:03,046 --> 01:53:05,139
For God's sake, Holmes, cut me loose.

1297
01:53:15,926 --> 01:53:19,555
First, the world will see you
for what you are. A fraud.

1298
01:53:21,164 --> 01:53:22,461
Then you'll be hanged.

1299
01:53:22,633 --> 01:53:24,498
Properly, this time.

1300
01:53:24,668 --> 01:53:26,761
It's a long journey from here to the rope.

1301
01:54:18,121 --> 01:54:21,022
I've never woken up in handcuffs before.

1302
01:54:22,059 --> 01:54:23,583
I have.

1303
01:54:24,895 --> 01:54:26,453
Naked.

1304
01:54:30,434 --> 01:54:32,561
Storm's coming.

1305
01:54:32,836 --> 01:54:36,397
Well, we've still got a moment.

1306
01:54:40,377 --> 01:54:41,639
Moriarty.

1307
01:54:41,812 --> 01:54:43,245
What?

1308
01:54:43,413 --> 01:54:45,381
That's his name.

1309
01:54:45,982 --> 01:54:48,143
And he is a professor.

1310
01:54:50,287 --> 01:54:52,346
Everyone has a weak spot...

1311
01:54:52,789 --> 01:54:55,019
and he found mine.

1312
01:54:56,460 --> 01:54:58,394
Where was it, precisely?

1313
01:55:09,306 --> 01:55:11,900
Please don't underestimate him.

1314
01:55:12,576 --> 01:55:14,976
He's just as brilliant as you are...

1315
01:55:15,145 --> 01:55:17,375
and infinitely more devious.

1316
01:55:17,547 --> 01:55:19,742
We'll see about that.

1317
01:55:21,879 --> 01:55:27,679
Subtitles: Arigon

1318
01:55:36,233 --> 01:55:38,633
You'll miss me, Sherlock.

1319
01:55:40,604 --> 01:55:42,299
Sadly...

1320
01:55:42,906 --> 01:55:44,567
yes.

1321
01:56:09,933 --> 01:56:11,764
Just keep it under your hat.

1322
01:56:11,935 --> 01:56:14,870
Afternoon, sir.
I put the notebooks in this one, sir.

1323
01:56:15,038 --> 01:56:16,972
- Thank you.
- What's in these, John?

1324
01:56:17,140 --> 01:56:18,164
Scribbles.

1325
01:56:18,341 --> 01:56:19,831
- Scribbles?
- Notes.

1326
01:56:20,010 --> 01:56:22,672
They're your adventures.
I'd like to read them.

1327
01:56:29,519 --> 01:56:30,850
Come on, what's wrong?

1328
01:56:31,021 --> 01:56:33,546
Do you think he's come to terms
with you leaving?

1329
01:56:33,723 --> 01:56:37,090
Mary, look at the ring he's given us.

1330
01:56:37,727 --> 01:56:40,025
Now, 5 minutes here
and we'll go home.

1331
01:56:40,197 --> 01:56:41,562
Our home.

1332
01:56:41,731 --> 01:56:43,392
Get up those stairs.

1333
01:56:51,308 --> 01:56:52,866
Don't worry, dear.

1334
01:56:53,043 --> 01:56:55,102
Suicide is not in his repertoire.

1335
01:56:55,278 --> 01:56:57,576
He's far too fond of himself for that.

1336
01:56:58,181 --> 01:56:59,842
Holmes.

1337
01:57:01,785 --> 01:57:03,612
Good afternoon.

1338
01:57:03,787 --> 01:57:07,883
I was trying to deduce the manner
in which Blackwood survived his execution.

1339
01:57:08,058 --> 01:57:10,117
Clearing your good name, as it were.

1340
01:57:10,460 --> 01:57:12,985
But it had a surprisingly
soporific effect...

1341
01:57:13,163 --> 01:57:16,860
and I was carried off in the arms
of Morpheus like a caterpillar in a cocoon.

1342
01:57:17,033 --> 01:57:18,398
Good afternoon, dear.

1343
01:57:18,568 --> 01:57:20,229
Get on with it, Holmes.

1344
01:57:20,403 --> 01:57:24,066
Cleverly concealed in the hangman's knot
was a hook.

1345
01:57:24,541 --> 01:57:27,210
Dear, my legs have fallen asleep.
I should come down.

1346
01:57:27,377 --> 01:57:28,969
John, shouldn't we help him down?

1347
01:57:29,145 --> 01:57:31,579
No, no, no,
I hate to cut him off midstream.

1348
01:57:31,748 --> 01:57:32,874
Carry on.

1349
01:57:33,950 --> 01:57:36,612
Well, the executioner
attached it to a harness...

1350
01:57:36,786 --> 01:57:39,550
allowing the weight to be
distributed around the waist...

1351
01:57:39,723 --> 01:57:41,782
and the neck to remain intact.

1352
01:57:41,958 --> 01:57:45,394
My Lord, I can't feel my cheeks.
Might we continue this at ground level?

1353
01:57:45,562 --> 01:57:47,189
How did you manage it, Holmes?

1354
01:57:47,831 --> 01:57:51,028
I managed it with braces,
belts and a coat hook.

1355
01:57:52,002 --> 01:57:54,869
Please, my tongue is going,
I'll be of no use to you at all.

1356
01:57:55,038 --> 01:57:56,733
- Worse things could happen.
- John.

1357
01:57:59,576 --> 01:58:02,704
Yet none of this explains
Blackwood's lack of pulse.

1358
01:58:02,879 --> 01:58:04,244
Right.

1359
01:58:04,414 --> 01:58:09,716
Now, the medical mystery.
We must restore your reputation, Watson.

1360
01:58:09,886 --> 01:58:13,515
There is a toxin refined from the nectar
of the rhododendron ponticum.

1361
01:58:13,690 --> 01:58:16,750
It's infamous in the region of Turkey
bordering the Black Sea...

1362
01:58:16,927 --> 01:58:20,419
for its ability to induce
an apparently mortal paralysis.

1363
01:58:20,597 --> 01:58:24,033
Enough to mislead a medical mind
even as well-trained as your own.

1364
01:58:24,200 --> 01:58:26,532
- It's known as...
- What's wrong with Gladstone?

1365
01:58:26,703 --> 01:58:28,568
Mad honey disease.

1366
01:58:29,038 --> 01:58:32,538
He's demonstrating the very
effect I've just described.

1367
01:58:32,909 --> 01:58:34,240
He doesn't mind.

1368
01:58:36,813 --> 01:58:39,213
Mary, don't worry, he's seen far worse.

1369
01:58:39,849 --> 01:58:41,214
Mr. Holmes?

1370
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:44,748
Doctor. Miss Mary.

1371
01:58:45,488 --> 01:58:48,582
Sir, Inspector Lestrade asks that
you come with me right away.

1372
01:58:49,125 --> 01:58:52,458
- What is it is this time, Clarkie?
- It's one of our sergeants, sir.

1373
01:58:52,629 --> 01:58:55,223
He went missing
the day you stopped Lord Blackwood.

1374
01:58:55,398 --> 01:58:58,993
I'm afraid sewage workers
found his body just this morning, sir.

1375
01:58:59,436 --> 01:59:02,496
We believe the sergeant
was our first man on the scene.

1376
01:59:02,672 --> 01:59:04,435
Can I help you, officer?

1377
01:59:05,208 --> 01:59:06,232
Shot in the head.

1378
01:59:07,911 --> 01:59:09,640
Was it a small caliber bullet?

1379
01:59:10,780 --> 01:59:12,111
Yes.

1380
01:59:13,617 --> 01:59:15,881
Were there powder burns
on his eyebrows?

1381
01:59:16,052 --> 01:59:17,713
Indeed, sir.

1382
01:59:19,856 --> 01:59:21,187
Point blank range?

1383
01:59:21,358 --> 01:59:22,586
Moriarty.

1384
01:59:24,027 --> 01:59:26,154
Professor Moriarty.

1385
01:59:29,032 --> 01:59:30,666
There's a good boy.

1386
01:59:30,834 --> 01:59:32,426
Everything's gonna be fine.

1387
01:59:33,637 --> 01:59:35,298
Where is Blackwood's device now?

1388
01:59:35,472 --> 01:59:38,532
Secret Service have it, sir.
They've taken over the case.

1389
01:59:39,042 --> 01:59:41,237
I'd wager there's a piece missing.

1390
01:59:43,213 --> 01:59:46,239
So Moriarty was after
a piece of the machine...

1391
01:59:46,850 --> 01:59:48,112
not the poison.

1392
01:59:48,284 --> 01:59:50,718
There's nothing more elusive
than an obvious fact.

1393
01:59:50,887 --> 01:59:53,321
The wire-free invention
was the game all along.

1394
01:59:53,490 --> 01:59:55,958
And Adler was just the diversion.

1395
01:59:56,126 --> 01:59:58,754
He knew I'd chase her,
leaving the machine accessible.

1396
01:59:58,928 --> 02:00:02,796
A technology of that kind
would be worth an untold fortune.

1397
02:00:02,966 --> 02:00:05,264
Imagine being able
to control any device...

1398
02:00:05,435 --> 02:00:09,098
simply by sending a command
via radio waves.

1399
02:00:09,873 --> 02:00:11,898
It's the future, Watson.

1400
02:00:14,177 --> 02:00:16,645
I've loaded the last of your boxes, sir.

1401
02:00:19,983 --> 02:00:21,541
Well...

1402
02:00:22,919 --> 02:00:25,911
- Gladstone.
- Stop him before he gets to the front door.

1403
02:00:26,356 --> 02:00:27,789
Clarkie.

1404
02:00:30,026 --> 02:00:31,857
Case reopened.
