One.

13
00:01:16,901 --> 00:01:20,882
Two..Three!

14
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:28,846
Twenty five grand to the first cocksucker
to nail a bullseye!

15
00:01:29,046 --> 00:01:31,539
Come on, let's go!

16
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,022
One.

17
00:01:34,331 --> 00:01:35,909
Two..

18
00:01:36,467 --> 00:01:39,293
..Three!
My name is Jordan Belfort.

19
00:01:40,232 --> 00:01:41,228
Not him,

20
00:01:41,428 --> 00:01:43,442
Me. That's right.

21
00:01:43,642 --> 00:01:45,247
I’m a former member of the middle class,

22
00:01:45,447 --> 00:01:49,588
raised by two accountants in a tiny
apartment in Bayside, Queens.

23
00:01:49,788 --> 00:01:52,266
The year I turned 26, as the head of
my own brokerage firm,

24
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:55,776
I made 49 million dollars.

25
00:01:55,976 --> 00:01:59,230
Which really pissed me off
because it was three shy of a million a week.

26
00:02:03,881 --> 00:02:07,612
No..no..no, my Ferrari was white.
Like Don Johnson’s in Miami Vice.

27
00:02:07,812 --> 00:02:09,883
Not red.

28
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:14,622
See that, humongous estate down there?

29
00:02:14,822 --> 00:02:16,920
That’s my house.

30
00:02:18,029 --> 00:02:22,148
My wife, Naomi.
The Duchess of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn.

31
00:02:22,862 --> 00:02:24,546
A former model and Miller Lite girl.

32
00:02:25,477 --> 00:02:29,559
Yeah, she was the one with my cock
in her mouth in the Ferrari,

33
00:02:29,887 --> 00:02:31,771
So, put your dick back in your pants.

34
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,719
In addition to Naomi and my
two perfect kids,

35
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:38,256
I own a mansion, private jet, six cars,
three horses,

36
00:02:38,456 --> 00:02:42,624
two vacation homes and a
170 foot yacht.

37
00:02:48,717 --> 00:02:52,204
I also gamble like a degenerate,
drink like a fish,

38
00:02:52,404 --> 00:02:54,815
I fuck hookers maybe
five-six times a week,

39
00:02:55,067 --> 00:02:58,780
I have three different Federal agencies
looking to indict me. Oh yeah..

40
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,130
...and I love drugs.

41
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:23,965
Pull up..Pull up!

42
00:03:24,165 --> 00:03:26,414
We’re gonna crash!!
For Christ's sake! Pull up!

43
00:03:28,236 --> 00:03:29,381
Juuusss..Relax.

44
00:03:39,768 --> 00:03:42,475
Are you okay?
- Yeah, i'm alright.

45
00:03:42,675 --> 00:03:43,675
Good job.

46
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,092
You get in there safe, alright?

47
00:03:47,562 --> 00:03:48,850
Next time, brahther.

48
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,050
Till next time.

49
00:03:56,044 --> 00:03:59,516
Yep, on a daily basis
I consume enough drugs,

50
00:03:59,716 --> 00:04:02,312
to sedate Manhattan,
Long Island...

51
00:04:02,511 --> 00:04:03,511
..and Queens.

52
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:06,593
For a month.
- Okay, Mr.Jordan.

53
00:04:06,793 --> 00:04:10,680
I take Quaaludes, ten to fifteen times
a day. For my back pain.

54
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,881
Adderall to stay focus.

55
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,393
Xanax to take the edge off, pot to mellow out,
cocaine to wake back up again and morphine well..

56
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:21,894
because it’s awesome.
Mornin' Blake.

57
00:04:28,326 --> 00:04:30,478
But of all the drugs
under God’s blue heaven,

58
00:04:30,678 --> 00:04:33,498
there’s one that’s
my absolute favorite.

59
00:04:34,077 --> 00:04:35,215
See...

60
00:04:35,955 --> 00:04:38,630
enough of this shit’ll make
you invincible,

61
00:04:39,587 --> 00:04:44,295
able to conquer the world
and eviscerate your enemies.

62
00:04:46,397 --> 00:04:48,403
And, I’m not talking about this.

63
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:51,511
I’m talking about <i>this</i>.

64
00:04:54,597 --> 00:04:56,306
See, Money doesn’t just buy you
a better life --

65
00:04:56,825 --> 00:04:58,943
better food, better cars,
better pussy --

66
00:04:59,552 --> 00:05:01,390
it also makes you a better person.

67
00:05:01,883 --> 00:05:04,940
<i>You can give generously to the church
or political party of your choice.</i>

68
00:05:05,622 --> 00:05:08,325
<i>You can save the fucking spotted
owl with money.</i>

69
00:05:12,725 --> 00:05:14,120
I've always wanted to be rich.

70
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:15,771
<i>So, let me go back.</i>

71
00:05:15,971 --> 00:05:20,637
I'm 22 years old. Newly married
and already a money crazed little shit.

72
00:05:20,837 --> 00:05:21,759
So, what do I do?

73
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:26,154
I go to the one place on earth
that befit my high minded ambitions.

74
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:41,397
<font color=#11A8E1>JERRY FOGEL:</font> You are lower than pond scum.

75
00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:44,908
You got a problem with that?

76
00:05:46,118 --> 00:05:47,192
Jordan?

77
00:05:47,392 --> 00:05:48,392
No.

78
00:05:48,592 --> 00:05:51,491
No problem at all.
- Good, because that is what you are.

79
00:05:51,691 --> 00:05:55,148
Pond scum.
Your job is ‘connector’, which means...

80
00:05:55,348 --> 00:05:58,042
that you'll be dialing the phone
over 500 times a day,

81
00:05:58,433 --> 00:06:00,357
trying to ‘connect’ me
with wealthy business owners.

82
00:06:00,557 --> 00:06:04,639
And, till you pass your Series 7,
that is all you’re gonna fucking be doing.

83
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,949
Sit. Sit!

84
00:06:08,074 --> 00:06:11,601
Just so you know, last year
I made over 300 thousand dollars.

85
00:06:11,801 --> 00:06:14,757
The other guy you'll be working for,
he made over a million.

86
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:15,957
A million dollars?

87
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:19,282
I could only imagine what a douchebag
that guy must be.

88
00:06:19,536 --> 00:06:22,494
Jordan Belfort?
- Yes, sir.

89
00:06:22,694 --> 00:06:24,523
Mark Hanna.
- A pleasure to meet you.

90
00:06:24,723 --> 00:06:27,283
And, you as well. I see,
you've already met the village asshole.

91
00:06:27,483 --> 00:06:28,729
Smile and dial.

92
00:06:28,929 --> 00:06:31,516
And don’t pick your
fucking head up till one.

93
00:06:31,716 --> 00:06:32,716
Hey, fuck him.

94
00:06:32,965 --> 00:06:35,493
I'm senior broker here,
he's just a worthless piker.

95
00:06:35,693 --> 00:06:36,693
Why don't you blow me, Hannah.

96
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:39,574
Now, Did you really pitched stock..

97
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:40,774
in your job interview?

98
00:06:40,825 --> 00:06:42,920
I had to do something to stand out.
Right, Sir.

99
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,443
I fuckin’ love that!

100
00:06:45,643 --> 00:06:48,051
Lunch, today.
- <font color=#11A8E1>Y</font>eah.

101
00:06:48,251 --> 00:06:51,281
We don't start dialing at 9:30
Because,

102
00:06:51,481 --> 00:06:53,637
our clients are already
answering the phone!

103
00:06:53,837 --> 00:06:54,837
Three, two..

104
00:06:55,037 --> 00:06:57,680
one..Let’s fuck!!

105
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,987
You want to know
what money sounds like?

106
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:03,318
Go to a trading floor on Wall Street.

107
00:07:03,518 --> 00:07:05,959
Fuck this, shit that.
Cunt, cock, asshole.

108
00:07:06,248 --> 00:07:09,059
I couldn’t believe how these guys
talked to each other.

109
00:07:09,464 --> 00:07:11,941
I was hooked within seconds.

110
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,989
It was like mainlining adrenaline.

111
00:07:19,593 --> 00:07:22,314
Fourty, Pick up the cocksuckin' phone!
- Sorry..

112
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,690
You're such a fuckin' deouchbag, Hanna.
- We don't give two shits about..

113
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:29,889
'How' technology works.

114
00:07:30,157 --> 00:07:32,432
Because, all we care about is
getting fuckin' rich!

115
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:35,644
Jordan Belfort..
- Solid..two thousand.

116
00:07:37,266 --> 00:07:39,193
Done!
Time to paint the tape.

117
00:07:39,715 --> 00:07:43,824
Whooow! Two thousand, Microsoft.
Going in the hole!

118
00:07:44,024 --> 00:07:45,024
C'mon.

119
00:07:45,224 --> 00:07:49,111
The pole man is alive.
Alive. Hold on to that, it's hot.

120
00:07:51,176 --> 00:07:53,284
Shut that motherfucker.
Shut it..shut it. Shut it!

121
00:07:53,484 --> 00:07:54,484
Sold!

122
00:08:21,881 --> 00:08:22,986
Tootski?

123
00:08:23,186 --> 00:08:24,186
No. Thank you, though.

124
00:08:24,386 --> 00:08:27,549
Mr. Hanna, what can I bring for you
on this glorious afternoon?

125
00:08:27,887 --> 00:08:29,907
Well, Hector, here’s the game plan.

126
00:08:30,107 --> 00:08:34,300
You're gonna nring us two Absolut Martinis,
You know how I like 'em, straight up.

127
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,899
And then, Precisely seven and one
half minutes after that,

128
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,947
You're gonna nring us two more,
and then..

129
00:08:39,147 --> 00:08:44,256
two more after that every five minutes,
until one of us passes the fuck out.

130
00:08:44,456 --> 00:08:46,537
An excellent strategy, Sir?

131
00:08:46,737 --> 00:08:49,440
I’m good with water for now,
though thank you.

132
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,590
It's his first day on Wall Street,
Give him time.

133
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,111
Thank you.
- Mmhmm.

134
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,448
Mr.Hanna..

135
00:08:58,648 --> 00:08:59,648
You're able to..

136
00:08:59,848 --> 00:09:03,778
..do drugs during the day
and still function and do your job?

137
00:09:03,978 --> 00:09:05,822
How the fuck else would you do this job?

138
00:09:06,022 --> 00:09:07,959
Cocaine and hookers, my friend.

139
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:09,159
Right.

140
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:14,142
I gotta say, I’m incredibly excited
about being part of your firm.

141
00:09:16,538 --> 00:09:19,307
The clients you have are absolutely..
- Fuck the clients.

142
00:09:19,507 --> 00:09:22,794
Your only responsibility is to put
mean on the table.

143
00:09:24,372 --> 00:09:26,237
You got a girlfriend?
- I am married.

144
00:09:26,437 --> 00:09:28,967
My wife, her name is Teresa.
She cuts hair.

145
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:30,168
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

146
00:09:30,368 --> 00:09:31,368
Think about Teresa.

147
00:09:31,823 --> 00:09:35,234
Name of the game?
Move the money from your client's pocket.

148
00:09:35,434 --> 00:09:37,660
Into your pocket.
- Right.

149
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,989
But, if you can make the clients money,
at the same time.

150
00:09:40,189 --> 00:09:42,458
It advantageous to everyone.
Correct?

151
00:09:42,658 --> 00:09:43,657
No.

152
00:09:45,447 --> 00:09:47,244
Number one rule of Wall Street.

153
00:09:47,444 --> 00:09:48,444
Nobody --

154
00:09:48,644 --> 00:09:51,732
okay, if you’re Warren Buffet
or Jimmy Buffet.

155
00:09:51,932 --> 00:09:56,276
Nobody knows, if a stock’s gonna go up,
down, sideways or fucking circles.

156
00:09:56,476 --> 00:09:57,476
Least of all stock brokers.

157
00:09:57,676 --> 00:10:00,739
It's all a Fughazi.
You know what a fughazi is?

158
00:10:00,939 --> 00:10:03,128
<i>Fugazi</i> it's a fake..

159
00:10:03,328 --> 00:10:05,926
Yeah, <i>Fugazi,</i> Fughazi.
It's a wazi, it's a woozi...

160
00:10:06,126 --> 00:10:09,706
..fairy dust.
It doesn't exist. It never landed.

161
00:10:09,906 --> 00:10:12,086
It is no matter.
It's not in the elemental chart.

162
00:10:12,286 --> 00:10:14,090
It's not fucking real!

163
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:17,295
Stay with me.
- Mmhmm.

164
00:10:17,495 --> 00:10:20,644
We don't create shit.
We don't build anything.

165
00:10:20,844 --> 00:10:24,205
So, you got a client.
Who bought stock at eight.

166
00:10:24,405 --> 00:10:25,405
And, announces it sixteen.

167
00:10:25,605 --> 00:10:28,395
He's all fucking happy,
He wants to cash in, liquidate.

168
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:31,765
Take his fucking money and run home.
You don't let him do that.

169
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,269
Cos, that would make it real.
- Right.

170
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:35,468
What do you do?

171
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:38,911
You get another brilliant idea.
A special Idea.

172
00:10:39,111 --> 00:10:41,402
Another situation.
Another stock.

173
00:10:41,602 --> 00:10:43,812
To reinvest his earnings
and then, some.

174
00:10:44,012 --> 00:10:47,466
And, he will. Every single time.
Cos, they're fuckin' addicted.

175
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,251
And, then..you just keep doing this.

176
00:10:49,451 --> 00:10:51,224
Again and again.
..and again.

177
00:10:51,424 --> 00:10:52,424
Meanwhile..

178
00:10:52,624 --> 00:10:55,805
He thinks, he is gettin' shit rich.
Which he is...On paper.

179
00:10:56,005 --> 00:10:57,005
But, you and me.
The brokers..

180
00:10:57,205 --> 00:11:02,081
we are taking home cold hard cash via.
Commission, motherfucker!

181
00:11:02,281 --> 00:11:03,281
Right.

182
00:11:05,644 --> 00:11:07,241
That's incredible Sir.

183
00:11:07,441 --> 00:11:09,521
I can't tell you, how excited I am.
- You should be.

184
00:11:09,721 --> 00:11:10,721
There's two keys,

185
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:13,866
to sucess,
in the broker business.

186
00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:15,066
First of all,

187
00:11:17,499 --> 00:11:19,162
You gotta stay relax.

188
00:11:19,362 --> 00:11:20,362
You jerk off?

189
00:11:22,722 --> 00:11:26,489
Do I jerk off? Yeah,Yeah,
I jerk off..yeah.

190
00:11:26,689 --> 00:11:27,689
How many times a week?

191
00:11:29,085 --> 00:11:31,741
Like, uhm..three four times, maybe.

192
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,801
Pump those numbers up.
Those are rookies number in this racket.

193
00:11:35,001 --> 00:11:37,800
I myself, I jerk off at least..

194
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,220
twice a day.
- Wow!

195
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,122
Once in the morning,
right after I work out.

196
00:11:42,322 --> 00:11:44,228
And, then once, right after lunch.
- Really?

197
00:11:45,729 --> 00:11:47,536
I want to.
That's not why I do it.

198
00:11:47,736 --> 00:11:49,787
I do it, cos i fucking need to.

199
00:11:49,987 --> 00:11:50,987
Think about it.

200
00:11:51,187 --> 00:11:53,586
You're dealing with numbers.
All day long.

201
00:11:53,786 --> 00:11:57,734
Decimal points..high frequencies.
Bang, bang bang. Iek, iek eik..

202
00:11:57,934 --> 00:11:59,738
Fucking digits!
Ke, ke..ke ke..

203
00:11:59,938 --> 00:12:01,732
All very acidic,
above the shoulders,

204
00:12:01,932 --> 00:12:02,932
mustered shit.

205
00:12:03,132 --> 00:12:04,132
Alright?

206
00:12:04,332 --> 00:12:06,335
That kind can weaken some people up.
Right?

207
00:12:06,535 --> 00:12:08,436
You gotta feed the geese.
Keep the blood flowing.

208
00:12:08,734 --> 00:12:10,656
And, keep the rhythm
below the belt.

209
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:11,856
Done.

210
00:12:12,056 --> 00:12:14,223
This is not a tip.
This is a perscription. Trust me.

211
00:12:14,423 --> 00:12:15,423
If you don't?

212
00:12:15,623 --> 00:12:17,358
You will fall out of balance.

213
00:12:17,558 --> 00:12:19,598
Split the differential..
and tip the fuck over.

214
00:12:19,798 --> 00:12:20,798
Or, worse shit.

215
00:12:20,998 --> 00:12:22,850
I've seen this happen..
Implode.

216
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,917
No, I don't wanna implode sir.
- No, you don't.

217
00:12:26,117 --> 00:12:27,117
I'm in it for the long run.
You know?

218
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:29,166
Yeah, implosions are ugly.
- Yeah.

219
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,334
Pop off to the bathroom,
work on it anytime you can.

220
00:12:31,534 --> 00:12:32,534
And, when you get really good at it.

221
00:12:32,663 --> 00:12:35,015
You'll fucking be stroking it.
And, you'll be thinking about money.

222
00:12:36,699 --> 00:12:39,802
Second..key to sucess.

223
00:12:40,002 --> 00:12:43,355
In this racket, Is this baby right here.
It's called cocaine.

224
00:12:44,922 --> 00:12:46,835
It will keep you sharp,
between the ears.

225
00:12:47,035 --> 00:12:49,996
It will also help your fingers dial faster.
And, guess what?

226
00:12:50,196 --> 00:12:51,196
That's good for me.

227
00:12:52,795 --> 00:12:54,929
Yes, sir.

228
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:56,735
Revolutions. You follow?

229
00:12:56,935 --> 00:12:59,915
Revolutions.
- Keep the client on the ferris wheel.

230
00:13:00,115 --> 00:13:03,151
And, it goes..the park is open.
24/7..365.

231
00:13:03,351 --> 00:13:06,210
Every decade..every
goddamn century.

232
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,410
That's it.

233
00:13:08,295 --> 00:13:10,033
The name of the game.

234
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:13,031
I'll key the key.

235
00:13:13,231 --> 00:13:14,231
Thank you.

236
00:13:32,492 --> 00:13:33,757
We are common denominator.

237
00:13:43,234 --> 00:13:44,339
Keep that for me.

238
00:13:59,363 --> 00:14:01,931
For the next six months I got to know
the 'ins' and 'out' of Wall Street.

239
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:06,197
Earning shit money,
as I geare up to take my Series 7.

240
00:14:21,585 --> 00:14:23,264
Then, I was a license broker at last.

241
00:14:24,678 --> 00:14:25,815
Ready to make my fortune.

242
00:14:26,678 --> 00:14:30,230
My first day as a future
Master of the Universe.

243
00:14:48,615 --> 00:14:49,887
They called it <i>Black Monday</i>.

244
00:14:50,703 --> 00:14:51,818
No shit.

245
00:14:52,018 --> 00:14:56,375
By four p.m. the market
had dropped 508 points,

246
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:59,534
the biggest plummet, since
the crash of ‘29.

247
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:08,456
This is not something, that
you wanna sell.

248
00:15:08,656 --> 00:15:09,656
You know what happened?
A fucking Tsunami.

249
00:15:09,856 --> 00:15:10,856
I think you're making a big mistake.

250
00:15:11,056 --> 00:15:14,490
Yes, I will talk to your wife.
- Trust me. Do not answer the phone.

251
00:15:14,726 --> 00:15:18,281
A lot of people are gonna be calling you.
Trying you to get your dirty laundry.

252
00:15:30,358 --> 00:15:31,709
Holy.

253
00:15:34,063 --> 00:15:35,962
Fucking..Shit!

254
00:15:37,086 --> 00:15:39,063
Unbelievable!

255
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,131
My first shitty day as a broker.

256
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:42,331
Within a month,

257
00:15:42,531 --> 00:15:46,529
L.F. Rothschild, an institution
since 1899,

258
00:15:46,729 --> 00:15:48,071
..closed its doors.

259
00:15:48,756 --> 00:15:50,598
Wall street had swallowed me up.

260
00:15:50,798 --> 00:15:53,827
And, shit me right back out again.

261
00:15:56,953 --> 00:15:58,945
We could pawn my engagement ring.
If we needed to.

262
00:15:59,145 --> 00:16:00,145
Cos, I don't mind.

263
00:16:00,345 --> 00:16:02,954
If we needed to, I'm saying i'm okay.
- Will you listen to me.

264
00:16:03,858 --> 00:16:05,808
We’re not pawning anything. Okay?

265
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:08,226
What'd I always tell you?
- You're gonna be a millionaire.

266
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:09,426
That's right, okay?

267
00:16:09,626 --> 00:16:12,428
Let me look..
We'll find something.

268
00:16:12,628 --> 00:16:13,628
How about this?
- What?

269
00:16:13,828 --> 00:16:16,600
- “Nobody Beats the Wiz”.
Electronic store.

270
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,223
Stock boy, what do you think?
- You're not gonna work at that place.

271
00:16:19,423 --> 00:16:21,541
Yeah, but you know..you start off..
- Jordan you're gonna be miserable..

272
00:16:21,741 --> 00:16:24,284
at that place, if you go there.
- It's sales. You work your way up..

273
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,189
You'd be a general manger..
- You're not gonna be a stock boy.

274
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:28,617
Why not?
- Cos, you're a stock broker.

275
00:16:28,817 --> 00:16:31,383
You understand that,
nobody is hiring stock brokers right now.

276
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:34,123
You understand that?
Okay?

277
00:16:39,047 --> 00:16:40,512
Ah, this place is..

278
00:16:40,712 --> 00:16:43,980
What does that say?
- Stock brokers.

279
00:16:46,196 --> 00:16:49,355
Long Island.
Stock brokers in Long Island.

280
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:12,253

They are out of Dubuque. Maybe,
it's microwaves, I'm not sure. But..

301
00:18:19,651 --> 00:18:20,651
You call the company's main line,

00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:23,110
their mom Dorothy answers,
and she's so sweet.

303

There's postmen,
there's always a postman.

307
00:18:36,578 --> 00:18:38,493
Plumbers, uhm..?

322
00:19:12,523 --> 00:19:13,523
Jordan, what did you get on
that Blue chip Stock?

323
00:19:14,349 --> 00:19:15,329
I make one percent.

324
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,592
Or, I did make one percent.

325
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:18,792
Pink sheets it's fifty.

326
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:19,993
It's fifty percent?

327
00:19:24,259 --> 00:19:25,139
It's fifty percent commission?

328
00:19:25,339 --> 00:19:26,339
Yup.

329
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:27,539
For what?

330
00:19:27,739 --> 00:19:30,171
It's our mark up for our services.

331
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:34,662
So, if I..if I sell a stock at
ten thousand dollars.

332
00:19:34,862 --> 00:19:36,898
My commission is five thousand bucks?

333
00:19:37,098 --> 00:19:39,369
If you sell ten thousand
dollars worth of this stock,

334
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:41,884
I'll personally give
you a blowjob for free.

335
00:19:43,843 --> 00:19:45,818
And, I hope it happens.

336
00:19:47,346 --> 00:19:48,857
Hello, John.
How're you doing today?

337
00:19:49,057 --> 00:19:51,875
You mailed in my company
a postcard, a few weeks back.

338
00:19:52,075 --> 00:19:54,642
Requesting, information
on penny stocks that had huge..

339
00:19:54,842 --> 00:19:57,646
upside potential with
very little downside risk.

340
00:19:57,846 --> 00:19:59,413
Does that ring a bell?
<i>- Oh, yeah. I may've sent you.</i>

341
00:19:59,613 --> 00:20:02,133
Okay great. Well, the reason
for the call today John is.

342
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:05,572
Something just came
across my desk John.

343
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:08,528
It is perhaps the best,
i've seen in the last six months.

344
00:20:08,728 --> 00:20:09,728
If you've sixty seconds,

345
00:20:09,928 --> 00:20:11,773
I'd like to share this with you.
You got a minute?

346
00:20:11,973 --> 00:20:15,242
The name of the company,
Aerotyne International..

347
00:20:15,442 --> 00:20:18,440
It is a cutting edge tech firm
out of the Midwest,

348
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,922
awaiting imminent patent approval,

349
00:20:21,122 --> 00:20:24,818
on a new generation of radar
detectors that have both huge military,

350
00:20:25,018 --> 00:20:26,759
and civilian applications.

351
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:27,959
Now.

352
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,682
Right now John. The stock trades over
the counter at ten cents a share,

353
00:20:31,882 --> 00:20:32,881
And, by the way John...

354
00:20:33,081 --> 00:20:36,238
Our analyst indicates,
it could go a heck of a lot higher after that.

355
00:20:36,438 --> 00:20:37,438
Your profit,

356
00:20:37,638 --> 00:20:40,414
on a mere six thousand dollar
investment would be, upwards of..

357
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,299
..sixty thousand dollars!

358
00:20:42,499 --> 00:20:46,082
Jesus! That's my morgage man!
- Exactly, you could pay off your morgage.

359
00:20:46,282 --> 00:20:49,080
John, one thing I can promise you.

360
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,280
Even in this market,

361
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,746
Is that I never ask my clients
to judge me on my winners.

362
00:20:53,946 --> 00:20:57,485
I ask them to judge me on my losers.
Because, they I have so few.

363
00:20:57,685 --> 00:20:58,685
And in the case of Aerotyne,

364
00:20:58,885 --> 00:21:02,220
Based on every technical
factor out there, John.

365
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,309
We are looking at a
Grand Slam home run.

366
00:21:07,729 --> 00:21:10,522
<i>I'll do four grand.</i>
Four thousand, that'd be 40 thousand shares, John.

367
00:21:10,722 --> 00:21:11,722
Let me lock in on that trade now,

368
00:21:11,922 --> 00:21:14,915
and get back to you with my secretary
with an exact confirmation.

369
00:21:15,115 --> 00:21:16,737
Sound good, John?
- That sounds good. Great.

370
00:21:16,937 --> 00:21:17,937
Hey, John?

371
00:21:18,137 --> 00:21:19,137
Thank you for your vote of confidence.

372
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,118
And, Welcome to the Investors Center.
<i>- Yeah, thanks alot. Bye.</i>

373
00:21:27,943 --> 00:21:29,545
How’d you fuckin’ do that?

374
00:21:31,816 --> 00:21:33,704
Just like that I made two grand.

375
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:36,449
The other guys looked at me like,
I’d just discovered fire.

376
00:21:38,699 --> 00:21:39,899
Great! Even better!

377
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:41,399
I was selling garbage to garbage men.

378
00:21:41,879 --> 00:21:43,079
And, making cash
hand over fist.

379
00:21:43,409 --> 00:21:46,281
The only problem you're gonna have is,
that you didn't buy more.

380
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:47,578
Boom..Shakalak!

381
00:21:48,038 --> 00:21:49,538
So, I was selling them shit.

382
00:21:49,838 --> 00:21:51,381
The way I look at it,

383
00:21:51,581 --> 00:21:53,530
Their money was better off
in my apartment.

384
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,897
I knew how to spend it better.

385
00:21:56,097 --> 00:21:57,033
Excuse me.

386
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,377
Is that your car, in the lot?

387
00:21:58,577 --> 00:21:59,577
Yeah.

388
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:01,714
That's a nice ride.
- Thanks man.

389
00:22:01,914 --> 00:22:02,914
Donnie Azoff.

390
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:04,817
Jordan Belfort.
Nice to meet you.

391
00:22:05,696 --> 00:22:08,610
You know, I’ve seen it around.
I've seen it around a lot.

392
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:11,911
I think, we live in the same building.
- No, shit?

393
00:22:12,111 --> 00:22:14,474
Twelfth floor?
- Yeah. What floor are you on?

394
00:22:14,674 --> 00:22:17,499
Fourth floor.
I have a four year old kid, ugly wife?

395
00:22:18,855 --> 00:22:19,895
So, what do you do, bro?

396
00:22:21,657 --> 00:22:23,065
What do you mean, what do I do?

397
00:22:23,265 --> 00:22:24,265
For work?
What do you do?

398
00:22:24,465 --> 00:22:25,465
I'm a Stock broker.

399
00:22:25,665 --> 00:22:27,618
Stock broker?
- Yeah.

400
00:22:27,818 --> 00:22:28,818
Childrens Furniture.

401
00:22:29,245 --> 00:22:30,275
Oh, good for you.

402
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:31,475
It's all right.

403
00:22:31,675 --> 00:22:33,748
You make a lot of money?

404
00:22:35,351 --> 00:22:36,886
Yeah, I do alright for myself.

405
00:22:37,086 --> 00:22:38,086
I'm trying..to put it together.

406
00:22:38,286 --> 00:22:41,257
Your fucking nice car?
We live in the same building?

407
00:22:41,457 --> 00:22:42,457
I'm not understanding...

408
00:22:42,614 --> 00:22:43,594
How much money do you make?

409
00:22:45,836 --> 00:22:47,950
I don't know.
Seventy Thousand last month.

410
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,150
Get the fuck..!

411
00:22:49,843 --> 00:22:51,633
Get the fuck out of here.

412
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:52,833
I'm serious.

413
00:22:53,033 --> 00:22:54,033
No, i'm serious too.

414
00:22:54,233 --> 00:22:55,960
Seriously, how much money
do you make?

415
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,160
I told you,

416
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:58,359
70 thousand.

417
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,177
Well, technically.
72 thousand last month.

418
00:23:02,377 --> 00:23:03,377
Somethin like that.

419
00:23:04,673 --> 00:23:07,442
You make 72 grand a month?
- Yeah.

420
00:23:11,802 --> 00:23:12,652
Tell you what.

421
00:23:14,112 --> 00:23:16,863
You show me a pay stub
with $72,000 on it,

422
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:19,199
I’ll quit my job right now
and I'll work for you.

423
00:23:26,231 --> 00:23:28,014
Hey, Paulie. What's up?

424
00:23:28,213 --> 00:23:29,213
No, yeah..everything's fine.

425
00:23:29,413 --> 00:23:31,190
Hey, listen.
I quit.

426
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,440
And he did quit his job,

427
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,866
which I thought was a little weird.
I mean, I had just met this fucking guy.

428
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,944
There were other things
about him too,

429
00:23:40,269 --> 00:23:41,899
like his phosphorescent white teeth;

430
00:23:43,109 --> 00:23:47,178
and the fact that he wore horn rims
with clear lenses to look more Waspy.

431
00:23:47,189 --> 00:23:50,188
Then, there were this..rumours.

432
00:23:51,216 --> 00:23:53,209
I heard this, stupid shit.
I don't know.

433
00:23:53,409 --> 00:23:54,409
I didn't even wanna bring it up.

434
00:23:54,609 --> 00:23:57,611
It's just...stupid.
- Is it about me?

435
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:58,811
You know, people say shit.

436
00:23:59,011 --> 00:24:01,638
I don't even listen to them,
half of the time.

437
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,365
What do they say?

438
00:24:04,565 --> 00:24:07,982
Shit, about you doing your cousin
or something like that?

439
00:24:08,182 --> 00:24:09,182
I don't even listen to it.

440
00:24:09,382 --> 00:24:10,381
Bro, it's not like that.

441
00:24:10,581 --> 00:24:11,581
You know,
it's not like that.

442
00:24:11,781 --> 00:24:15,435
I mean, like you married your cousin.
Some stupid shit.

443
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,347
Yeah, my wife..yeah,
my wife is my cousin.

444
00:24:19,547 --> 00:24:22,238
It's not like what you think,
whatever..you know?

445
00:24:22,438 --> 00:24:24,714
Is she like a...first cousin?
or is she...

446
00:24:24,914 --> 00:24:28,411
Her..her father,

447
00:24:28,611 --> 00:24:30,645
is the brother of my Mom.

448
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:31,845
It's not like...

449
00:24:32,045 --> 00:24:33,045
We grew up together.

450
00:24:33,245 --> 00:24:36,577
And, she grew up hot..you know.
She fucking grew up hot.

451
00:24:36,777 --> 00:24:37,778
All my friends were trying
to fuck her. You know?

452
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:39,940
I'm not gonna let someone...

453
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,766
One of these assholes fuck my cousin.
So, I used the cousin thing as....

454
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:48,013
I'm not gonna let,
someone else fuck my cousin.

455
00:24:48,213 --> 00:24:50,629
If any one is gonna fuck my cousin,
it's gonna be me.

456
00:24:50,828 --> 00:24:52,521
Out of respect. You know..
- No..I get it. Yeah..

457
00:24:52,721 --> 00:24:55,182
You're not afraid of like the
whole kid thing, right?

458
00:24:55,382 --> 00:24:56,382
What? Having kid with her?

459
00:24:56,582 --> 00:24:57,582
Yeah.
- No, we have two kids.

460
00:24:59,104 --> 00:25:00,658
I don't mean..
I don't wanna get personal..

461
00:25:00,858 --> 00:25:01,857
They're okay?

462
00:25:02,057 --> 00:25:04,031
No, they're not retarded
or anything like that.

463
00:25:04,231 --> 00:25:05,253
But, there'a big chance, right?

464
00:25:05,643 --> 00:25:06,593
Yeah...

465
00:25:06,793 --> 00:25:07,793
There is like a..
sixty percent..

466
00:25:07,993 --> 00:25:11,763
You know, sixty sixty-five percent
chance the kid's gonna be fucking retarded..

467
00:25:11,963 --> 00:25:12,963
..or whatever.
- That scares the shit out of me, buddy.

468
00:25:13,163 --> 00:25:17,749
Look, man. A lot happen with kids. Whatever
takes biz whether you're fucking cousin or not..

469
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:20,000
What if something like that happened?

470
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,271
I basically, you know?
If the kid is retarted.

471
00:25:22,471 --> 00:25:24,860
I would drive it up
to the country,

472
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:28,058
and just like, open the door and
i'm gonna set you free now.

473
00:25:28,258 --> 00:25:30,645
You know, like run free..
You know..

474
00:25:36,281 --> 00:25:37,879
I'm completely fucking with you!

475
00:25:39,491 --> 00:25:41,548
That's horrible...

476
00:25:43,195 --> 00:25:46,403
No. We would take it to institution
or something where it's handled like..

477
00:25:46,603 --> 00:25:47,603
Raise the kid or whatever..

478
00:25:49,105 --> 00:25:50,800
You know what?
If you're happy, God bless you, buddy.

479
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
No, i'm not fucking happy.

480
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,053
No one who's married
is fucking happy.

481
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:56,013
Well, i'm sorry to hear that, buddy.

482
00:25:56,213 --> 00:25:57,213
Listen, i'm really..

483
00:25:58,424 --> 00:26:00,688
I'm really appreciative
of this fucking job.

484
00:26:00,888 --> 00:26:03,624
I'm really enjoying..
- I'm really happy of what you're doing..

485
00:26:03,824 --> 00:26:05,589
Actually, I got you
a little present.

486
00:26:05,789 --> 00:26:07,713
You got me a present?
- I got you something, yeah.

487
00:26:07,913 --> 00:26:10,001
You're sweet!
-It's in the back though.

488
00:26:11,635 --> 00:26:12,922
We gotta go out back.

489
00:26:13,122 --> 00:26:14,794
What, it's wrapped up or something?

490
00:26:14,994 --> 00:26:15,994
It's wrapped up yeah.

491
00:26:16,194 --> 00:26:17,194
I don't get it.

492
00:26:17,394 --> 00:26:19,400
We can do it while you're
in fucking car. Come on.

493
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:23,709
I'm not fucking doing this.
You're out of your fucking mind.

494
00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:25,636
Do this shit bro.
No.

495
00:26:25,836 --> 00:26:26,836
No one is fucking here bro.

496
00:26:28,278 --> 00:26:29,502
Get the fuck in.

497
00:26:29,702 --> 00:26:31,345
Smoke this crack with me bro.

498
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:35,018
Smoke some fucking
crack with me bro.

499
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:37,625
One hit.
That's it.

500
00:27:11,155 --> 00:27:13,857
We gotta get out of here, buddy.

501
00:27:14,057 --> 00:27:16,710
We gotta get out of here.
Let's go fucking run.

502
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:20,076
Let's run like a fucking
lion and tirger in pairs!

503
00:27:21,533 --> 00:27:24,740
Let's fucking run!
Let's fucking run!

504
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,933
Go..go...go..go!

505
00:27:27,962 --> 00:27:30,006
<i>You've reached Frank's auto body.</i>

Hello, my name is Jordan Belfort.

509
00:27:35,551 --> 00:27:36,550
My partner and I are..

510
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,729
very interested in renting
out your garage.

511
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,133
Donnie and I were
going out on our own.

512
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:43,861
And,the first thing we needed
was brokers.

513
00:27:44,061 --> 00:27:45,754
Guys with sales experience.

514
00:27:45,954 --> 00:27:48,037
So, I recruited some
of my home town boys.

515
00:27:48,237 --> 00:27:51,168
Sea Otter.
Who sole meat and weed.

516
00:27:51,368 --> 00:27:54,425
Chester..who sold tyres and weed.

517
00:27:54,625 --> 00:27:55,625
And, Robbie...

518
00:27:55,825 --> 00:27:57,582
who sold anything
he could get his hands on.

519
00:27:57,782 --> 00:27:58,782
Mostly, weed.

520
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:02,814
This is Brad.

521
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,790
And, Brad's the guy I really wanted.

522
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:05,969
But, he didn't go along with us.

523
00:28:06,169 --> 00:28:08,732
He was already making so much
money selling Qualutes.

524
00:28:08,932 --> 00:28:11,378
He’d become the Quaalude
king of Bayside.

525
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:12,839
You get any pussy
with that thing or what?

526
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,541
Yeah, man. Of course man.
- Bring some chicks around here sometime huh.

527
00:28:15,741 --> 00:28:18,093
Little morch...little morch.

528
00:28:19,443 --> 00:28:20,482
Hey, Zit.

529
00:28:20,682 --> 00:28:23,031
Tell your sister,
I was asking about her.

530
00:28:23,231 --> 00:28:25,851
But you bring me a pair of her panties,
next time you come through.

531
00:28:26,051 --> 00:28:28,844
Yeah, man. She said,
they don't wanna talk to you man.

532
00:28:29,044 --> 00:28:31,142
Get the fuck out of here.

533
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:33,602
Hey, Ma.
We got chicken or what?

534
00:28:33,802 --> 00:28:35,693
Ma?!

535
00:28:36,746 --> 00:28:38,624
You listening?
It's easier than you think.

536
00:28:38,824 --> 00:28:39,824
Every person
you're on the phone with,

537
00:28:40,024 --> 00:28:42,830
They wanna get rich
and they wanna get rich quickly.

538
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,783
They all want something for nothing.
- There was this one time,

539
00:28:44,983 --> 00:28:48,014
That i was selling pot to Amish dude.
You know guy's that got like the beard,

540
00:28:48,356 --> 00:28:49,836
With like no mustache or some bullshit..
- Yeah..yeah.

541
00:28:50,426 --> 00:28:53,521
Well, he says that he only wants
to make furniture.

542
00:28:55,023 --> 00:28:56,551
What's that gotta do with anything?
- I don't understand.

543
00:28:56,751 --> 00:28:58,730
What the fuck are you talking about?

544
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,834
I'm not putting words into
your mouth or nothing, But..

545
00:29:01,034 --> 00:29:03,809
you just said that,
Everybody wants to get rich.

546
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:06,089
Holy fuck, you did just said that.
- Yeah, you said that.

547
00:29:07,589 --> 00:29:10,057
What the fuck are you talking about?
- Yeah, like buddhist.

548
00:29:10,258 --> 00:29:12,184
They don't give a shit about money.
They're wrapped in sheets!

549
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:13,384
They don't buy shits.
- I'm not..i'm..I'm not talking..

550
00:29:13,584 --> 00:29:14,584
...about Buddhist or Amish.

551
00:29:14,784 --> 00:29:16,520
I'm talking about normal people.

552
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,030
Working class, everyday people.
Everyone wants to get rich.

553
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,278
Am I crazy?
- There's no such thing as Amish Buddhist..

554
00:29:21,478 --> 00:29:22,620
I am pretty fucking sure.
- No, I didn't..

555
00:29:23,624 --> 00:29:25,652
Can we get some Ketchup please?
- I didn't say Amish buddhist..

556
00:29:25,852 --> 00:29:27,222
Do you guys not wanna make money?

557
00:29:29,003 --> 00:29:30,417
I wanna make some
fucking money, okay?

558
00:29:30,617 --> 00:29:31,617
I can sell anything.

559
00:29:31,817 --> 00:29:35,136
Shit, I can sell lubes to convent full of Nuns
getting horny to be fuckin' each other.

560
00:29:35,336 --> 00:29:37,646
That's the attitude!
You can sell anything?

561
00:29:37,846 --> 00:29:39,605
Sell me, this fucking pen
right here.

562
00:29:39,805 --> 00:29:40,805
You can sell anything..
Sell that.

563
00:29:41,005 --> 00:29:42,005
Sell me that pen?

564
00:29:42,972 --> 00:29:44,980
Can I finish eating first?
I hadn't eaten today.

565
00:29:45,412 --> 00:29:47,127
Brad, show em how it's done.

566
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,098
Boom. Sell me that pen.
Watch, go on.

567
00:29:49,298 --> 00:29:50,297
You want me to sell this
fucking pen?

568
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:51,497
That's my boy right there.

569
00:29:51,697 --> 00:29:53,319
Fucking sell anything.

570
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:55,807
Why don't you do me a favour?
Write your name down on that napkin for me?

571
00:29:56,007 --> 00:29:57,007
I don't have a pen.

572
00:29:57,207 --> 00:29:59,198
Exactly.
Supply and demand, my friend.

573
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:01,295
See what I mean?
He's creating urgency.

574
00:30:01,495 --> 00:30:04,485
Getting you to want to buy this stock.
Gotta make it as something that they need.

575
00:30:04,691 --> 00:30:05,771
That's the thing.

576
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,642
All nuns are lesbians.

577
00:30:07,842 --> 00:30:10,148
What the fuck are you
talking about, Otter?

578
00:30:10,348 --> 00:30:11,347
Yeah, think about it.
They can't keep in dudes..

579
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:15,060
Four fucking times.
Get me four times.

580
00:30:17,332 --> 00:30:20,692
Look, I knew these guys
weren't like Harvard MBAs.

581
00:30:21,009 --> 00:30:24,683
Robbie Feinberg the pin head,
took five years to finish High School.

582
00:30:25,209 --> 00:30:27,800
Alden Kupferberg- The sea otter,
Didn't even graduate.

583
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,259
Chester Ming, the depraved Chinaman
thought Jiujitsu was in Israel.

584
00:30:32,478 --> 00:30:34,570
Smartest of the bunch was
Nicky Koskoff.

585
00:30:34,838 --> 00:30:36,038
He actually went to Law School.

586
00:30:36,408 --> 00:30:40,112
I call him "Rugrat" b'cos of his
piece of shit hairpiece.

587
00:30:41,209 --> 00:30:43,648
Still, give me them young,
hungry and stupid.

588
00:30:43,848 --> 00:30:47,300
And, in no time
I’ll make them rich.

589
00:30:49,571 --> 00:30:51,713
Omigod. Jordan.

590
00:30:51,912 --> 00:30:52,912
You like it, baby?

591
00:30:54,663 --> 00:30:55,969
It’s beautiful.

592
00:30:56,169 --> 00:30:57,169
They’re not the biggest
stones in the world.

593
00:30:57,369 --> 00:30:59,937
But, I promise
they are really high quality.

594
00:31:00,137 --> 00:31:02,733
This is beautiful.
I don't...it's so beautiful.

595
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,870
Oh, boy.
- What?

596
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,070
I know that look.

597
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,918
What is it? Go ahead.
- I don't know, it's..

598
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:15,487
These stocks, these companies.
They are like, crappy companies?

599
00:31:15,687 --> 00:31:18,219
Yeah, Yeah.
They are terrible.

600
00:31:19,771 --> 00:31:22,219
Don't worry about it. I told you,
What i'm doing is, completely legal.

601
00:31:22,419 --> 00:31:25,052
Yeah, I know. They're like, they're not
gonna make any money though, right?

602
00:31:26,657 --> 00:31:28,410
Sometimes they do.
Sometimes, they don't.

603
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:29,610
You know, how it goes.

604
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:30,810
Wouldn’t you feel better,

605
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:34,451
if you sold that stuffs to rich people,
who can like afford to lose alot of money?

606
00:31:36,609 --> 00:31:37,754
Of course.

607
00:31:37,954 --> 00:31:40,694
But, rich people don’t buy penny stocks.

608
00:31:40,894 --> 00:31:41,894
They just don't.

609
00:31:43,365 --> 00:31:44,507
Why not?

610
00:31:46,353 --> 00:31:49,399
Because they’re too smart,
that’s why not.

611
00:31:49,723 --> 00:31:51,943
I mean, what person with
a college education.

612
00:31:52,533 --> 00:31:54,468
Would trust this bunch of jerk offs?

613
00:31:57,732 --> 00:32:00,335
But what if they didn’t sound like
a bunch of jerk offs?

614
00:32:00,742 --> 00:32:03,362
What if, I can teach them
how to sell it to people with money?

615
00:32:05,251 --> 00:32:06,431
<i>Real money.</i>

616
00:32:06,631 --> 00:32:07,751
So, I decided to re-invent the company.

617
00:32:07,951 --> 00:32:09,707
Gentlemen,

618
00:32:09,907 --> 00:32:13,570
Welcome to Stratton Oakmont.

619
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:14,769
You snooks will now be targeting
the wealthiest.

620
00:32:16,141 --> 00:32:18,547
one percent of Americans.

621
00:32:18,747 --> 00:32:20,854
I'm talking about Whales, here.

622
00:32:21,054 --> 00:32:22,054
Moby 'fucking' Dicks.

623
00:32:22,254 --> 00:32:24,439
And, with this script.

624
00:32:24,638 --> 00:32:26,549
Which is now your new 'Harpoon'..

625
00:32:26,749 --> 00:32:30,263
I'm goona teach each and everyone
of you to be Captain...

626
00:32:30,463 --> 00:32:31,463
Fucking Ahab.

627
00:32:31,663 --> 00:32:33,790
Get it? Huh?

628
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:34,989
Captain Who?

629
00:32:35,189 --> 00:32:36,926
Captain Ahab.
From the fucking...

630
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:40,220
Book..motherfucker.
From the book.

631
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,420
Turn you fucking brain on!

632
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:44,079
Listen to me.

633
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:46,663
We are a new company,
with a new name.

634
00:32:46,863 --> 00:32:49,673
A Company, that our clients
can believe in.

635
00:32:49,873 --> 00:32:52,760
A Company, that our clients can trust.

636
00:32:53,228 --> 00:32:54,518
A firm, whose roots..

637
00:32:55,308 --> 00:32:57,598
are so deeply embedded
into Wall Street,

638
00:32:57,798 --> 00:32:58,798
That our very Founders,

639
00:32:58,998 --> 00:33:01,424
Sailed over n the Mayflower,

640
00:33:01,624 --> 00:33:02,624
chiselled the name
Stratton Oakmont,

641
00:33:03,298 --> 00:33:04,998
right into plummet fucking rock.

642
00:33:05,198 --> 00:33:06,197
Got it?

643
00:33:07,467 --> 00:33:08,647
What we are gonna do is this.

644
00:33:08,847 --> 00:33:11,746
First we pitch them
Disney, AT&T,

645
00:33:11,946 --> 00:33:14,461
IBM, blue chips stocks
exclusively.

646
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:16,650
Companies at these peoples moan.

647
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:17,850
Once we sucker them in,

648
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:20,820
We unload the dog shits.

649
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,088
The pink sheets, the pennies stocks.

650
00:33:23,288 --> 00:33:24,288
Where we laid the money.

651
00:33:24,686 --> 00:33:26,699
50% commission baby.

652
00:33:26,899 --> 00:33:29,963
Now, the key to making money
in a situation like this,

653
00:33:30,163 --> 00:33:32,885
Is to position yourself now,
before the settlement.

654
00:33:33,085 --> 00:33:35,845
Because, by the time you read
about it in The Wall Street Journal.

655
00:33:36,045 --> 00:33:38,428
It's already too late.

656
00:33:38,628 --> 00:33:39,717
And you wait.

657
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:40,917
You wait.

658
00:33:41,117 --> 00:33:44,084
And, whoever speaks first.. loses.

659
00:33:46,659 --> 00:33:48,858
<i>Sorry, I appreciate the call.</i>

660
00:33:49,058 --> 00:33:51,388
<i>I realy have to give this some thought.</i>

661
00:33:51,588 --> 00:33:53,231
<i>and, uh..talking to my wife about it.</i>

662
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:54,431
<i>Can I call you back?</i>

663
00:33:54,631 --> 00:33:56,087
They don't know, right?
They gotta think about it.

664
00:33:56,287 --> 00:33:58,340
They gotta talk to the fucking wives.
Or the fucking tooth fairy..

665
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,420
The point is it doesn't matter
what the fuck they say.

666
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:03,457
The only objection they have is
they don't trust you guys.

667
00:34:03,657 --> 00:34:05,752
And, why should they trust you?
I mean, look at you..

668
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:07,551
you're a bunch of fucking
sleazy salemen right?

669
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:10,672
So, what do you say?
- You mean to tell me that..

670
00:34:10,872 --> 00:34:14,941
if I put you in Union Carbide at 7
and took you out at 32..

671
00:34:15,141 --> 00:34:17,569
Texas Instruments at 11 and took
you out at 47..

672
00:34:17,769 --> 00:34:20,029
You're still at 16 and took you out at 41,

673
00:34:20,229 --> 00:34:21,229
..you wouldn’t say Chester..

674
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:23,777
pick me up a few thousand
shares at Disney?

675
00:34:23,977 --> 00:34:26,539
On the spot, right now. C’mon.
- I mean, honestly Kevin. Honestly..

676
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:28,595
Seriously?
- I don't know you.

677
00:34:28,795 --> 00:34:31,013
You cold called me.
You're a total stranger..

678
00:34:31,471 --> 00:34:34,295
I'm in complete agreement with you,
You don't know me, I don't know you..

679
00:34:35,641 --> 00:34:37,571
..Alden Kupferberg.
- Robbie Feinberg.

680
00:34:37,771 --> 00:34:38,770
Chester Ming.
- I'm Senior Vice president at Stratton

681
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,656
...Oakmont.
- and I plan on being one of the...

682
00:34:41,856 --> 00:34:44,616
Top broker in my firm next year.
- And, I'm not gonna get there,

683
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:45,816
by being wrong, Stan.
- I do wanna say that..

684
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:50,186
you sound like a pretty sincere guy.

685
00:34:50,386 --> 00:34:52,634
It's not gonna make you rich.
It's not gonn make you poor.

686
00:34:52,834 --> 00:34:54,914
But, what Stratton..will do
is serve as a...

687
00:34:55,114 --> 00:34:58,638
Benchmark, for future business, Kevin.
- You feel comfortable with me, Scott?

688
00:34:58,838 --> 00:34:59,981
And, then you'll know for sure,

689
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:03,712
That you've finally found the broker
on Wall Street that you can trust.

690
00:35:03,912 --> 00:35:07,612
And who can consistently,
make you money.

691
00:35:07,812 --> 00:35:08,812
Sound fair enough?

692
00:35:12,815 --> 00:35:15,584
<i>Yeah, I gotta say,
I'm pretty impressed.</i>

693
00:35:16,804 --> 00:35:19,188
<i>What do..what do you think?</i>

694
00:35:19,388 --> 00:35:20,387
Kevin?

695
00:35:20,587 --> 00:35:22,891
You give me one shot here,

696
00:35:23,091 --> 00:35:25,213
On a blue chip stock like Kodak.

697
00:35:25,413 --> 00:35:27,379
And, believe me..Kevin.

698
00:35:27,579 --> 00:35:30,194
The only problem you gonna have..

699
00:35:30,393 --> 00:35:32,626
is that you didn't buy more.

700
00:35:32,826 --> 00:35:34,789
Sound fair enough?

701
00:35:36,597 --> 00:35:38,061
<i>Shit..</i>

702
00:35:41,258 --> 00:35:43,857
<i>My wife might devorce me.
but, yeah.. let's do it.</i>

703
00:35:46,192 --> 00:35:48,431
Excellent choice, Kevin. How much
do you wanna go for it, this time?

704
00:35:48,631 --> 00:35:50,987
Let's do five..five thousand dollars.

705
00:35:51,187 --> 00:35:52,187
Why don't we try eight thousand, Kevin?

706
00:35:52,387 --> 00:35:53,387
All right, let's do ten.

707
00:35:53,587 --> 00:35:54,587
Ten?
- You wanna do that?

708
00:35:54,787 --> 00:35:55,787
Excellent choice.

709
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,381
Kevin, let me lock in that trade
right now and get back to you,

710
00:35:58,581 --> 00:36:00,135
in a few minutes.
With the exact confirmation.

711
00:36:00,335 --> 00:36:01,467
Kevin, and Welcome..

712
00:36:01,667 --> 00:36:04,138
..to Stratton Oakmond.
- Thanks man, I'm gonna have a beer,

713
00:36:05,841 --> 00:36:07,652
This is fun.
- Take it easy Kevin.

714
00:36:08,304 --> 00:36:09,863
Thanks Jordan.
Thanks a lot.

715
00:36:17,367 --> 00:36:19,215
What a fucking idiot.
- The one..

716
00:36:19,415 --> 00:36:22,595
..thing I know about
in this world is Airlines.

717
00:36:22,795 --> 00:36:26,295
And Kushon Airlines is the
future of Airlines.

718
00:36:26,495 --> 00:36:28,161
Get in now..
- My name is Nicky Koskoff.

719
00:36:28,361 --> 00:36:31,931
Chester Ming, and i'm a Senior
Vice President at Stratton Oakmont.

720
00:36:33,096 --> 00:36:36,126
Truly I'm so so sorry for your loss.

721
00:36:36,571 --> 00:36:39,070
When did he passed?
- Just think I'm wrong..

722
00:36:43,865 --> 00:36:47,612
It's like getting in on sunlight before
there's any sunlight, you understand?

723
00:36:51,896 --> 00:36:55,667
That was a very intelligent decision
I'm happy to transfer you to our sale associate.

724
00:36:55,867 --> 00:36:57,715
Rhonda.

725
00:36:57,915 --> 00:36:58,915
Rhonda?

726
00:36:59,115 --> 00:37:01,215
Has anybody fucking seen Rhonda?

727
00:37:08,015 --> 00:37:09,655
Everybody have a good week?

728
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:12,339
End of the month.

729
00:37:12,659 --> 00:37:15,723
$28.7 million in gross commissions,

730
00:37:15,923 --> 00:37:19,278
All from Pink Sheets Stock Boys!

731
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:23,690
And to celebrate with a weekly
act of debauchery,

732
00:37:23,889 --> 00:37:27,269
I have offered our lovely sales
assistant Danielle Harrison here,

733
00:37:27,469 --> 00:37:28,469
ten thousand dollars..

734
00:37:29,177 --> 00:37:31,464
To shave a fucking eye!

735
00:37:31,908 --> 00:37:33,148
Yeah!

736
00:37:34,407 --> 00:37:37,804
You want this?
Huh? You want this?!

737
00:37:39,397 --> 00:37:42,881
Let the shaving begin!

738
00:37:43,081 --> 00:37:44,665
Scalp, scalp...scalp.

739
00:37:44,666 --> 00:37:47,165
Scalp, scalp...scalp..scalp,
scalp...scalp.

740
00:37:49,666 --> 00:37:54,320
FYI Boys, Danielle’s promised to use
This 10 thousand dollars for breast implants!

741
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:58,205
She's already got C-cups,
But now she wants fucking Double Ds!

742
00:37:58,405 --> 00:38:00,764
Is this a great company or what?!

743
00:38:03,759 --> 00:38:06,102
This is the greatest fucking
company of the world!

744
00:38:09,826 --> 00:38:10,659
Dominic..

745
00:38:10,904 --> 00:38:13,804
Blow the roof off this
motherfucker!

746
00:39:41,237 --> 00:39:42,912
Word spread throughout
Wall Street.

747
00:39:44,767 --> 00:39:45,947
Even in places I didn't want it to.

748
00:39:55,897 --> 00:39:58,586
It wasn't long before
Forbes Magazine.

749
00:39:58,786 --> 00:40:02,058
The flagship of Wall Street
called to do a 'Profile' on me.

750
00:40:02,258 --> 00:40:04,823
Let me ask you, How do you see
the future for Straten Oakland.

751
00:40:05,023 --> 00:40:06,023
One word..

752
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,031
Diversification.

753
00:40:10,231 --> 00:40:12,005
That's good.
Thank you so much.

754
00:40:12,205 --> 00:40:13,205
I have more than enough.
- Fantastic..fantastic.

755
00:40:13,405 --> 00:40:14,405
Can we get a quick picture?

756
00:40:15,645 --> 00:40:18,310
A total fucking hatchet job.

757
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:20,834
This conniving little twat!
Look at this?

758
00:40:21,034 --> 00:40:24,008
“The Wolf of Wall Street”.
They call me..look.

759
00:40:24,208 --> 00:40:25,208
Your hair looks good.

760
00:40:26,834 --> 00:40:27,934
<i>“Jordan Belfort,</i>

761
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:30,910
<i>sounding like a kind
of twisted Robin Hood</i>

762
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:33,554
<i> who takes from the rich
and gives to himself</i>

763
00:40:33,754 --> 00:40:35,719
<i> and his merry band of brokers”. </i>

764
00:40:35,919 --> 00:40:37,012
Read that..read it.
- Listen.

765
00:40:37,212 --> 00:40:38,212
There’s no such thing,

766
00:40:38,412 --> 00:40:41,891
as bad publicity, Sweeheart.
- Read the article.

767
00:40:42,091 --> 00:40:43,091
Jordan, you look great.

768
00:40:43,291 --> 00:40:45,347
You're in a huge magazine.

769
00:40:54,097 --> 00:40:55,196
Calm the fuck down!

770
00:40:56,449 --> 00:40:56,513
What the hell’s all this?

771
00:40:56,713 --> 00:40:59,360
It's the Forbes article.
They all wanna work for you now.

772
00:40:59,622 --> 00:41:01,151
Hey, what did I say?!

773
00:41:02,853 --> 00:41:05,634
Hey, you want a job?
You talk to me!

774
00:41:07,106 --> 00:41:09,064
Forbes had made me a superstar.

775
00:41:10,581 --> 00:41:15,264
Every day, dozens of money-crazed
kids beat a path to my door.

776
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,373
If we hired ‘em,

777
00:41:17,573 --> 00:41:19,554
they dropped out of college
overnight..

778
00:41:19,754 --> 00:41:23,811
and spend whatever allowance they had
on a new suit from our Straten tailor.

779
00:41:24,011 --> 00:41:25,011
Are you fuckin' serious right now!

780
00:41:26,324 --> 00:41:29,211
I mean, we're literally putting
clothes on these kids backs.

781
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,529
And here comes, this jerk off
sniffing around.

782
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:35,489
You know, everytime someone
rises up in the world.

783
00:41:35,989 --> 00:41:39,009
There's always gonna be
some asshole trying to drag him down.

784
00:41:40,489 --> 00:41:43,042
Within months,
we doubled in size,

785
00:41:43,242 --> 00:41:45,494
moved to even bigger offices.

786
00:41:52,482 --> 00:41:54,342
It was a madhouse,
a greed-fest,

787
00:41:54,542 --> 00:41:58,966
with equal parts cocaine,
testosterone and body fluids.

788
00:42:01,532 --> 00:42:02,592
It got so bad.

789
00:42:03,162 --> 00:42:05,147
I had to declare
the office a fuck-free zone,

790
00:42:05,347 --> 00:42:06,347
between the hours of 9 and 7,

791
00:42:07,167 --> 00:42:09,440
but i'm telling you
even that didn’t help.

792
00:42:09,647 --> 00:42:12,287
Actually the madness started
on our very first day,

793
00:42:12,756 --> 00:42:14,671
when one of our brokers,
Ben Jenner,

794
00:42:14,871 --> 00:42:18,239
christened the elevator by getting
a blowjob from a sales assistant.

795
00:42:18,439 --> 00:42:20,236
Her name was Pam and to her credit,

796
00:42:20,706 --> 00:42:22,706
she did have an amazing
technique, with this..

797
00:42:23,365 --> 00:42:24,735
wild twist and jerk motion.

798
00:42:25,735 --> 00:42:26,966
About a month later,

799
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:29,277
Donnie and I decided
to dowble-team her,

800
00:42:29,477 --> 00:42:32,771
On a saturday afternoon while our wives
were out shopping for Christmas dresses.

801
00:42:33,244 --> 00:42:35,084
Eventually Ben married her,
which was..

802
00:42:35,604 --> 00:42:39,368
pretty amazing considering
she blew every single guy in the office.

803
00:42:40,144 --> 00:42:42,772
He then got depressed and killed
himself three years later.

804
00:42:42,972 --> 00:42:46,422
Anyway, I hired my Dad Max
to maintain order,

805
00:42:46,622 --> 00:42:47,622
As the enforcer.

806
00:42:47,743 --> 00:42:49,764
Stratten's very own Gestapo.

807
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:53,564
We called him Mad Max
because of his hair-trigger temper,

808
00:42:54,303 --> 00:42:57,753
which could be set off by something
as innocuous as a ringing telephone.

809
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:00,103
Who the fuck

810
00:43:00,863 --> 00:43:04,740
has the goddamn gall to call this
house on a Tuesday night!

811
00:43:05,962 --> 00:43:07,991
Goddammit!
- You're gonna miss it.

812
00:43:08,191 --> 00:43:10,136
Oh, please tell me something
I don't know.

813
00:43:10,336 --> 00:43:14,196
I wait all week for the fucking <i>Equalizer</i>.
And they have to fucking...

814
00:43:14,691 --> 00:43:18,753
Hello?... - Gene, how are you Gene?
<i>But, as soon as he picked up the phone.</i>

815
00:43:18,953 --> 00:43:20,702
<i>He'd affect this weird British accent.</i>

816
00:43:20,902 --> 00:43:21,801
right-eo.Gene that will be great...

817
00:43:22,721 --> 00:43:23,701
Cheerio.
<i>It was absolutely...</i>

818
00:43:24,331 --> 00:43:26,930
The fucking half-wit!
<i>..bizzare.</i>

819
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:29,575
You missed it!
<i>And He's Mad Max all over again.</i>

820
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,321
Alright, tell me what happened.
What happened?

821
00:43:33,521 --> 00:43:34,521
Well, he discovered..

822
00:43:34,721 --> 00:43:37,097
..it was his mother's sister.
- Who is he? Who?

823
00:43:37,297 --> 00:43:39,736
The main guy.
You know the main guy.

824
00:43:39,936 --> 00:43:42,768
It was his mother's sister.
She showed up dead.

825
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:47,831
<i>Of course, Mad Max didn't have to know
everything we're doing at Straten.</i>

826
00:43:48,031 --> 00:43:49,234
Then, there's a big target.

827
00:43:50,483 --> 00:43:52,839
They get launched and stick?
- There's a bullseye..

828
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:54,039
The bullseye is a dollar sign.

829
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:56,236
Whoever, gets closer to the dollar
sign get the most bucks.

830
00:43:57,948 --> 00:44:00,403
So, if he gets hurts,
what happens?

831
00:44:01,398 --> 00:44:02,628
I don't think,
he's gonna get hurt.

832
00:44:02,828 --> 00:44:05,197
they’ve got, like, superhuman
strength anyway.

833
00:44:05,397 --> 00:44:07,976
You can't look him right
in the eyes.

834
00:44:08,176 --> 00:44:10,851
You can't look him in the eye?
- That's a fact. It's on PBS.

835
00:44:11,051 --> 00:44:13,375
They get confused and
their wires get crossed.

836
00:44:13,575 --> 00:44:14,575
You gotta look like at the chin.

837
00:44:14,775 --> 00:44:17,110
Looks like i'm look at you
but i'm lookin' at your chin.

838
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:19,667
They're like the monalisa,

839
00:44:19,867 --> 00:44:23,015
They find eye contact, like whever
you're standing at the room.

840
00:44:23,215 --> 00:44:24,215
Then, they lock it..

841
00:44:24,415 --> 00:44:26,375
But, there's a limit to what
we can do with him?

842
00:44:27,016 --> 00:44:28,556
We're allowed to throw shit at him.
We're allowed to throw..

843
00:44:28,756 --> 00:44:29,756
foods..bananas..

844
00:44:29,956 --> 00:44:32,797
But, for example,
what i wouldn't do is maybe like..

845
00:44:32,997 --> 00:44:33,997
tell him to pull his cock out..

846
00:44:34,197 --> 00:44:36,820
and like get some of the girls
to fondle him or shit..

847
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,265
Let's keep that in our
back pocket.

848
00:44:38,855 --> 00:44:41,599
This guy's more about thrown
at the dartboard.

849
00:44:42,015 --> 00:44:43,065
The thing is...
this is their gift, okay.

850
00:44:43,495 --> 00:44:45,695
They're build to be thrown.
Like a lawn dart.

851
00:44:45,895 --> 00:44:48,273
Their top is heavy. Like a lawn dart,
they're build for accuracy.

852
00:44:49,344 --> 00:44:50,444
Can we bowl with this guy?

853
00:44:50,644 --> 00:44:51,644
That's his fucking brother, Robbie.

854
00:44:51,844 --> 00:44:52,844
The brother is the bowling ball.

855
00:44:53,044 --> 00:44:54,044
The brother,

856
00:44:54,244 --> 00:44:55,948
you put a skateboard on him,
strapped him to a skateboard..

857
00:44:56,148 --> 00:44:57,148
And, toss him down an alley
at some pins.

858
00:44:57,348 --> 00:44:58,995
No, shit.
That's interesting.

859
00:44:59,195 --> 00:45:00,195
Can we get that guy?

860
00:45:00,395 --> 00:45:01,939
We'll get that guy too.
But, it says here..

861
00:45:02,139 --> 00:45:03,139
<i>This guy will show his cock.</i>

862
00:45:05,173 --> 00:45:06,449
They’re very ornery,
by the way.

863
00:45:06,649 --> 00:45:08,576
So, you gotta be careful.
With these litle guys, okay?

864
00:45:08,776 --> 00:45:09,776
Safety is first, alright?

865
00:45:09,993 --> 00:45:12,101
I want some of those fucking
Tranquilizer gun ready..

866
00:45:12,301 --> 00:45:13,301
to knock these fucker out.

867
00:45:14,303 --> 00:45:15,353
Maze, taser guns?

868
00:45:15,553 --> 00:45:16,553
A pallet gun, maybe?

869
00:45:16,753 --> 00:45:19,188
No, pallet gun's gonna hurt em.
I just want em out!

870
00:45:19,802 --> 00:45:22,541
I say, we stick with the 'loophole'.
Right..okay?

871
00:45:22,741 --> 00:45:24,812
If we don't consider him a human,
we consider him as an act.

872
00:45:25,012 --> 00:45:26,693
I think we're in the clear.

873
00:45:26,972 --> 00:45:28,736
Like, you know like flying willanders,
you know a lot of those guys died,

874
00:45:28,936 --> 00:45:30,645
Bu, they never sued anybody.
- The important thing..

875
00:45:30,845 --> 00:45:31,845
you guys gotta keep in mind is

876
00:45:32,045 --> 00:45:35,272
that these things gossip.
They get together and they gossip.

877
00:45:35,472 --> 00:45:37,461
That's a good point.
- And the last thing that we need..

878
00:45:37,661 --> 00:45:40,332
is them getting together
and say, ' oh, they made fun of us'..

879
00:45:40,532 --> 00:45:42,887
It's gonna make Straten look bad.
- That's why I love you.

880
00:45:43,087 --> 00:45:44,087
You think of shits like that.

881
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,591
We treat it just like
one of us, okay?

882
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,460
One of us,
copul gobul one of us.

883
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:53,439
We accept them one of us.
Copul gobul one of us.

884
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,688
We accept them one of us.
Copul gobul one of us.

885
00:45:55,888 --> 00:45:56,888
Copul gobul one of us.
- Jordan!

886
00:45:57,088 --> 00:45:58,088
Your dad’s coming.

887
00:45:58,288 --> 00:45:59,817
Something to do with the
American Express bill.

888
00:46:00,017 --> 00:46:02,379
Get him out of here?
- Yeah, lick my twat.

889
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:03,699
No, I'm serious.

890
00:46:08,644 --> 00:46:10,322
Make some shit up.

891
00:46:13,258 --> 00:46:14,358
$430,000 dollars

892
00:46:15,048 --> 00:46:17,625
..in one month, Jordy? Huh?

893
00:46:17,825 --> 00:46:21,203
Four-hundred-and-fucking-
thirty-thousand fucking dollars..

894
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:22,567
In one fucking month!

895
00:46:24,427 --> 00:46:25,417
They’re business expenses.
Just relax

896
00:46:25,827 --> 00:46:27,387
Jordy, look what you got here?

897
00:46:27,587 --> 00:46:28,587
Look at this.

898
00:46:28,787 --> 00:46:32,040
26 thousand dollars
for one fucking dinner!

899
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,240
Okay, no..no..no.
This could be explained.

900
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,426
Dad we had clients.
We had Pfi..Pfizer clients.

901
00:46:36,626 --> 00:46:38,415
Right, the portal house from argentina.

902
00:46:38,615 --> 00:46:40,388
Expensive champagne, the wine..
we had to buy champange,

903
00:46:40,588 --> 00:46:43,085
And you got all the fucking sides.
Tell him what the sides were.

904
00:46:43,285 --> 00:46:44,448
I ordered sides, so..
- Sides?

905
00:46:44,648 --> 00:46:45,886
$26,000

906
00:46:46,196 --> 00:46:47,506
Worth of sides?!

907
00:46:48,076 --> 00:46:50,117
What are these sides?
They cure cancer?

908
00:46:50,317 --> 00:46:52,162
The sides did cure cancer.
That's the problem.

909
00:46:52,362 --> 00:46:53,362
They were up there.
That's why they were expensive.

910
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:55,295
Shut the fuck up.
- I'm seriou..

911
00:46:55,495 --> 00:46:56,495
Stop.

912
00:46:56,695 --> 00:46:57,695
And, EJ Entertainment.

913
00:46:57,725 --> 00:46:59,809
What the fuck is EJ Entertainment?!

914
00:47:00,009 --> 00:47:02,486
Well..that's uh..

915
00:47:02,686 --> 00:47:04,497
Yeah, Jordan.
What's EJ Entertainment?!

916
00:47:04,697 --> 00:47:05,697
Jordan what is that?

917
00:47:05,897 --> 00:47:07,545
It’s a fucking prostitution ring, Jordy.

918
00:47:07,745 --> 00:47:08,745
That's what it is!

919
00:47:08,945 --> 00:47:09,945
That is what it is.

920
00:47:10,145 --> 00:47:12,258
Isn't that the perfect,
description for them?

921
00:47:12,458 --> 00:47:13,458
That is what it is...but..

922
00:47:13,658 --> 00:47:14,658
None of this were charged to me.

923
00:47:14,913 --> 00:47:16,293
This is all of them.

924
00:47:16,653 --> 00:47:18,163
Oh, it's all us?

925
00:47:18,363 --> 00:47:20,166
It wasn't me though.
Fucking explain this shit to him.

926
00:47:20,366 --> 00:47:22,458
These are all your fucking charges!
Right here.

927
00:47:22,658 --> 00:47:25,512
The IRS they allow for T&A, that's fine.

928
00:47:25,712 --> 00:47:26,712
T&E

929
00:47:26,913 --> 00:47:28,817
T&E
- I said, T&E.

930
00:47:29,017 --> 00:47:30,017
No, you said T&A.
- No, I didn't.

931
00:47:30,103 --> 00:47:31,953
Yeah, you did. Yeah, you did.

932
00:47:32,309 --> 00:47:33,727
You said T&A.
It's T&E. alright?

933
00:47:33,927 --> 00:47:36,164
I know you're upset about the dinner.
And that makes sense.

934
00:47:36,364 --> 00:47:39,201
B'cos, we did spend too much money.
But, I said T&E.

935
00:47:39,401 --> 00:47:41,107
Don't tell me what you said.
I heard what you said.

936
00:47:41,307 --> 00:47:42,307
Dad, he said T&A.
- He did.

937
00:47:42,507 --> 00:47:44,192
He said T&A.
- Absolutely, no question.

938
00:47:46,411 --> 00:47:47,591
I'm getting this close!

939
00:47:47,791 --> 00:47:48,791
That's what i'm saying.

940
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:49,991
I want you to open up more, Max.

941
00:47:50,291 --> 00:47:51,377
He's gonna fucking kill you.

942
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:52,577
Why do you hold it in?

943
00:47:52,777 --> 00:47:55,088
Max, Max..Why do you hold it in?
- That's it.

944
00:47:55,288 --> 00:47:56,288
That's it.
Get the fuck out of here.

945
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:02,384
What kinda hookers take credit card?
- A rich one!

946
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:04,149
In Stratton, there were three
kinds of hookers.

947
00:48:04,769 --> 00:48:06,530
The blue chips, top of the line.
Model material.

948
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:10,079
They cost between $300 and $500
and you had wear a condom.

949
00:48:10,279 --> 00:48:11,279
unless, you gave them a hefty tip,

950
00:48:11,479 --> 00:48:13,520
which of course, I always did.

951
00:48:13,769 --> 00:48:14,829
Then came NASDAQs,

952
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:17,173
who were pretty,
but not great,

953
00:48:17,373 --> 00:48:19,193
They cost betweem two to three
hundred bucks.

954
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:22,218
Finally there were pink sheets, skanks.

955
00:48:22,659 --> 00:48:23,669
They cost about a hundred or less,

956
00:48:24,048 --> 00:48:27,296
and if you didn't wear a condom,
you'd get a penicillin shot the next day,

957
00:48:27,496 --> 00:48:28,496
and pray your dick didn't fall off.

958
00:48:29,228 --> 00:48:30,538
Not that we didn’t fuck them, too.

959
00:48:30,858 --> 00:48:33,505
Believe me, we did.

960
00:48:33,705 --> 00:48:35,806
It's that slip disc thing again.

961
00:48:36,006 --> 00:48:37,006
I know what it is.
You know,

962
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:39,998
too much..with EJ entertainment.

963
00:48:41,331 --> 00:48:42,556
How are things at home?

964
00:48:42,756 --> 00:48:43,756
Well, not the best.

965
00:48:43,956 --> 00:48:47,042
It just doesn't...
you know what i'm saying.

966
00:48:47,242 --> 00:48:48,242
It's like the smell..

967
00:48:48,442 --> 00:48:50,819
There's a smell,there's attraction
thing and after a while,

968
00:48:51,019 --> 00:48:52,020
It just kinda fades away
a little bit..

969
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,401
Yeah, well..it's supposed
to fade away.

970
00:48:54,601 --> 00:48:56,171
Supposed to?
- That's marriage.

971
00:48:56,371 --> 00:48:57,371
You know,
your mother and I.

972
00:48:57,571 --> 00:48:59,587
We've been married a long long time.
- I know.

973
00:48:59,787 --> 00:49:02,192
What do you think?
We're jumping into bed every two minutes?

974
00:49:02,392 --> 00:49:03,998
It doesn't work that way.
- I love her to death.

975
00:49:04,198 --> 00:49:06,349
I wanna stay married, Dad.
But..uh..

976
00:49:06,549 --> 00:49:07,549
It's crazy out there.

977
00:49:07,749 --> 00:49:10,513
Some of these girls, you should
see them. Oh my God!

978
00:49:10,713 --> 00:49:13,879
They're fucking..the things
they're doing now, Pops.

979
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:16,436
I mean..it's whole
on another level.

980
00:49:16,636 --> 00:49:18,090
Really?
- And, they're all shaved too.

981
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:20,075
Get out of here!
- They're all shaven.

982
00:49:20,302 --> 00:49:23,359
Are you kidding me? No bush?
- Bald as a China-doll.

983
00:49:23,559 --> 00:49:25,172
No, bush.
- Oh my God!

984
00:49:25,372 --> 00:49:29,595
All of a sudden, One week.
Nobody'd anything down there, anywhere.

985
00:49:29,795 --> 00:49:32,327
It's a new world.
- They're bald from the eyebrows down.

986
00:49:32,527 --> 00:49:34,447
Wow.
- Nothing. Not a stitches.

987
00:49:34,647 --> 00:49:36,720
Like lasers.
- Wow, new world, see?

988
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,404
I was born too, too.. early.

989
00:49:39,604 --> 00:49:42,057
I've never been a fan of bush,
to be honest.

990
00:49:42,257 --> 00:49:43,257
Really?
- Yeah.

991
00:49:43,457 --> 00:49:44,457
I don't mind it.

992
00:49:44,657 --> 00:49:45,657
Dad..

993
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:48,493
I dont want you stressing out
about any of these.

994
00:49:48,693 --> 00:49:49,693
How can I not get stressed out?

995
00:49:49,893 --> 00:49:51,549
Look at the knuckleheads
you got working for you?

996
00:49:51,749 --> 00:49:54,320
I know they're knuckleheads
but I need em to live like me.

997
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,268
You get it?
To lived like me.

998
00:49:56,468 --> 00:49:57,467
Jordy,

999
00:49:57,667 --> 00:50:01,544
one of these days, the chickens are
gonna come home to roost.

1000
00:50:04,155 --> 00:50:05,723
You're looking at me like
I'm crazy.

1001
00:50:05,923 --> 00:50:06,923
Crazy?

1002
00:50:07,123 --> 00:50:08,706
This is Obscene!

1003
00:50:08,906 --> 00:50:09,906
It was obscene --

1004
00:50:10,106 --> 00:50:12,006
in the normal world.

1005
00:50:12,206 --> 00:50:15,181
But, who wanted to live there?

1006
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:27,290
Fucking magic!
I love this!

1007
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:32,220
We got minds up here,
that's gonna take this company.

1008
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:36,027
Into the fucking
stratosphere!

1009
00:50:38,638 --> 00:50:40,895
Jor-dan!
Jor-dan!  Jor-dan!

1010
00:50:43,955 --> 00:50:45,802
Fuck Merrill Lynch,
Fuck them.

1011
00:50:46,002 --> 00:50:47,002
Why should they be taking
all the fucking money,

1012
00:50:47,202 --> 00:50:48,365
all the fucking time.

1013
00:50:49,347 --> 00:50:50,737
It was our next big move.

1014
00:50:51,237 --> 00:50:53,037
Finding companies to take public.

1015
00:50:53,657 --> 00:50:54,587
IPOs.

1016
00:50:55,037 --> 00:50:56,718
It was the only way,
these Wall Street pricks..

1017
00:50:56,918 --> 00:50:57,918
would ever stop thinking
of us as some..

1018
00:50:58,826 --> 00:51:00,124
..shit kicker bucket shot.

1019
00:51:00,324 --> 00:51:01,324
We’ve got Arncliffe National,

1020
00:51:01,796 --> 00:51:03,418
See, we were a little different.

1021
00:51:03,618 --> 00:51:04,618
We liked to get as fucked
up as possible.

1022
00:51:04,818 --> 00:51:06,873
During our business pow-wows.

1023
00:51:07,246 --> 00:51:09,196
In order to stimulate
our free flowing ideas.

1024
00:51:10,016 --> 00:51:12,096
Which is why, we're popping
these ludes like they're M&Ms.

1025
00:51:14,686 --> 00:51:17,572
We own the fuckin' comp..

1026
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:20,215
We own the company...
<i>Don't know what a lude is?</i>

1027
00:51:20,415 --> 00:51:21,415
I'll tell you.

1028
00:51:21,615 --> 00:51:23,382
Ah, wait.
Wait wait wait.

1029
00:51:23,582 --> 00:51:25,460
Looks like those ludes,

1030
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:28,606
are woking their magic on
Donnie right now.

1031
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:03,139
The Qualude.

1032
00:52:03,339 --> 00:52:06,069
or 'lude' as it is commonly referred to.

1033
00:52:06,269 --> 00:52:10,157
Was first synthesized
in 1951 by an Indian doctor.

1034
00:52:10,357 --> 00:52:11,356
that’s not feathers..

1035
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:12,799
-- as a sedative..

1036
00:52:12,999 --> 00:52:17,059
and was prescribed to stressed out
housewives with sleep disorders.

1037
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:18,259
But, pretty soon..

1038
00:52:18,459 --> 00:52:19,459
someone figured out..

1039
00:52:19,659 --> 00:52:23,139
that if you resisted the urge
to sleep for fifteen minutes,

1040
00:52:23,339 --> 00:52:25,792
you got a pretty
kick-ass high from it.

1041
00:52:25,992 --> 00:52:29,938
Didn’t take long  for people
to start abusing ludes, ‘course,

1042
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:32,629
and in 1982 the U.S.
Government Schedule One’d them,

1043
00:52:32,829 --> 00:52:35,131
along with the rest of the world.

1044
00:52:35,579 --> 00:52:38,620
Which meant there was only a finite
amount of these things left.

1045
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:39,820
No shit,

1046
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:42,410
you can’t even buy ‘em anymore.

1047
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:44,867
You people’re all
shit outta luck.

1048
00:52:45,919 --> 00:52:48,016
What is it?
- Steeef Maddin..

1049
00:52:48,216 --> 00:52:49,216
Steeef Maddin..

1050
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,416
Steeef..
-Steeef.

1051
00:52:52,049 --> 00:52:53,218
You remember those ads?

1052
00:52:54,211 --> 00:52:56,329
Those giant headed girls
with the bunked eyes,

1053
00:52:56,529 --> 00:52:57,529
wearing those big clunky shoes.

1054
00:52:58,192 --> 00:52:59,906
My friend from school
Steve Madden.

1055
00:53:00,106 --> 00:53:01,778
His friend from school
Steve Madden.

1056
00:53:02,108 --> 00:53:04,850
Steve Madden was 'The name'
in women shoes at that moment and,

1057
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:08,311
and all of Wall Street was
begging to take his company public.

1058
00:53:09,547 --> 00:53:11,416
Except, guess who grew
up with him?

1059
00:53:11,616 --> 00:53:12,616
Women shoes.
Women shoose.

1060
00:53:12,816 --> 00:53:15,622
My very own Vice President.

1061
00:53:17,967 --> 00:53:19,989
Diamond Donnie Azoff.

1062
00:53:22,876 --> 00:53:26,269
Jordan, you better come check
this fucking chick out.

1063
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:28,053
Look.

1064
00:53:33,368 --> 00:53:35,559
I would fuck that girl,
if she was my sister.

1065
00:53:35,759 --> 00:53:38,530
I would let that girl,
give me fucking aids.

1066
00:53:43,577 --> 00:53:45,385
She's hot.
- Cristy.

1067
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:53,567
Jordan, this is my friend Naomi.

1068
00:53:53,767 --> 00:53:54,766
Hi.
- Naomi.

1069
00:53:54,966 --> 00:53:55,966
Nice to meet you.

1070
00:53:56,173 --> 00:53:57,493
Naomi, Nice to meet you.

1071
00:53:57,693 --> 00:53:59,525
You have an awesome place here.

1072
00:53:59,725 --> 00:54:02,513
I don’t think I’ve ever been
in a house like this big before.

1073
00:54:02,713 --> 00:54:03,713
Oh, really?
- Yeah. - Beautiful beach out there..

1074
00:54:04,472 --> 00:54:05,572
Blair Hollingsworth.

1075
00:54:07,188 --> 00:54:08,302
Hi. Buddy, nice to meet you.

1076
00:54:08,592 --> 00:54:10,039
Name's Blair right?
- Yeah.

1077
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:11,239
You like to jet ski?

1078
00:54:11,439 --> 00:54:12,439
I've never done it before.

1079
00:54:12,703 --> 00:54:13,933
you’ve never jet-ski’ed in your life?!

1080
00:54:14,782 --> 00:54:16,112
No, i've never jet-ski'ed.
- You’ve never been to jet-ski’ed..

1081
00:54:16,502 --> 00:54:17,732
No, i haven't.
- How many times you gonna ask her,

1082
00:54:17,932 --> 00:54:18,932
She's never been on a jer ski.

1083
00:54:19,132 --> 00:54:21,733
I don't know,
I might ask her a couple more times.

1084
00:54:21,933 --> 00:54:22,933
Okay.

1085
00:54:25,578 --> 00:54:26,906
Hi, I'm Hildy.

1086
00:54:27,106 --> 00:54:28,106
Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

1087
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:29,912
Jordan, Teresa needs your help.

00:54:30,112 --> 00:54:31,112
Yeah. I'll be out in couple of minutes.

1089
00:54:31,312 --> 00:54:32,926
Just tell her,
I'll be out in couple of minutes.

1090
00:54:33,126 --> 00:54:35,922
Why don't you tell your wife that?
- How am I to do that, when i'm having a conversation?

1091
00:54:36,122 --> 00:54:38,521
What am I, your secretary?
- I think, we should get going.

1092
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:39,930
Wait, wait.
where're you guys going?

1093
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:41,875
We gotta go. We got two other parties
we're supposed to get to.

1094
00:54:42,075 --> 00:54:43,075
We can stay for a drink.
- Yes, stay for a drink.

1095
00:54:43,275 --> 00:54:46,024
No, we got two other parties
we're supposed to get to. so..

1096
00:54:46,419 --> 00:54:47,449
Why don't you let her stay for a bit.

1097
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:50,345
Let her stay for a bit.
What's the big deal?

1098
00:54:50,545 --> 00:54:52,145
You like champagne?
- I do.

1099
00:54:52,345 --> 00:54:54,627
Donnie, what the fuck
are you doing?

1100
00:54:54,827 --> 00:54:55,827
You piece of shit!

1101
00:55:04,674 --> 00:55:05,976
You guys're gonna have
to excuse my friend.

1102
00:55:06,176 --> 00:55:07,175
Get the fuck out of here!

1103
00:55:12,265 --> 00:55:14,361
Let him fucking finish, Hildy.

1104
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:15,561
That's fucking rude!

1105
00:55:21,894 --> 00:55:23,412
So, Bay Ridge.
That’s near Staten Island, right?

1106
00:55:23,612 --> 00:55:26,029
Brooklyn, across the Verrazano Bridge.

1107
00:55:26,229 --> 00:55:28,144
Saturday night fever, territory.
- That's right.

1108
00:55:28,344 --> 00:55:29,344
Guinea gulch.

1109
00:55:29,544 --> 00:55:31,856
We call the Verrazano Bridge
guinea gang point.

1110
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:34,867
So, I presume,
You’re Italian?

1111
00:55:35,067 --> 00:55:36,067
On my dad’s side.

1112
00:55:36,267 --> 00:55:39,403
I'm also Dutch,
German, English..

1113
00:55:39,603 --> 00:55:40,604
-- I’m a mutt.

1114
00:55:40,804 --> 00:55:41,804
Oh, you're a mutt.

1115
00:55:42,004 --> 00:55:44,731
Yeah. Actually, I have family
over there, in London.

1116
00:55:44,931 --> 00:55:45,931
My Aunt Emma.

1117
00:55:46,131 --> 00:55:47,131
She's the best.

1118
00:55:47,331 --> 00:55:50,587
Very British, you know?
Classy Lady.

1119
00:55:50,787 --> 00:55:51,787
That explains it then.

1120
00:55:51,987 --> 00:55:52,987
Explains what?

1121
00:55:53,187 --> 00:55:54,434
Explains you. I mean..

1122
00:55:54,634 --> 00:55:55,634
You’re a Duchess, right.

1123
00:55:55,834 --> 00:55:58,220
The Duchess of Bay Ridge.

1124
00:56:01,463 --> 00:56:02,320
Excuse me?

1125
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,591
Can I get a straw please?

1126
00:56:06,192 --> 00:56:07,759
Thank you.

1127
00:56:10,091 --> 00:56:11,696
So, I was umm..

1128
00:56:11,896 --> 00:56:15,253
...a little surprised you
asked Cristy for my number.

1129
00:56:16,805 --> 00:56:18,317
Why's that?

1130
00:56:20,138 --> 00:56:21,596
Aren’t you married?

1131
00:56:22,814 --> 00:56:23,926
Well..

1132
00:56:24,126 --> 00:56:25,126
Yeah, but..what?

1133
00:56:25,326 --> 00:56:27,788
Married people can’t have friends?

1134
00:56:29,678 --> 00:56:31,422
We're gonna be friends?

1135
00:56:31,622 --> 00:56:32,622
Yeah.

1136
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:35,595
You don't wanna be my friend?

1137
00:56:38,992 --> 00:56:41,575
We are not gonna be friends.

1138
00:56:50,282 --> 00:56:52,397
--and at night I work my designs.

1139
00:56:52,597 --> 00:56:54,921
I have an entire line of lingerie..

1140
00:56:55,121 --> 00:56:57,797
Camisoles, bustiers, panties.

1141
00:56:59,430 --> 00:57:01,433
She designs panties, too?

1142
00:57:01,633 --> 00:57:04,113
Oh my God!

1143
00:57:13,636 --> 00:57:15,884
C'mon, Jordan, think of a way to get
up to her apartment?!

1144
00:57:21,714 --> 00:57:23,585
You wanna come up
for some tea or something?

1145
00:57:25,552 --> 00:57:26,535
Tea? Yeah.

1146
00:57:26,735 --> 00:57:28,928
Like hot tea?
- Yeah.

1147
00:57:29,128 --> 00:57:30,128
Sounds nice.

1148
00:57:30,328 --> 00:57:32,695
Tea. Fuck yeah.
I want to come up for tea.

1149
00:57:32,895 --> 00:57:36,701
Darjeeling..Rosettes..or
something of that shit..

1150
00:57:36,901 --> 00:57:37,901
Rocky.
Who's this.

1151
00:57:38,925 --> 00:57:41,471
Say hi, Rocky.
- Hi, sweet heart.

1152
00:57:44,238 --> 00:57:46,492
Why don’t you light a fire?
I’ll be right out.

1153
00:57:46,692 --> 00:57:48,747
Fire here.
- Sure.

1154
00:57:52,208 --> 00:57:54,487
I like painting here,
It's uh...

1155
00:58:00,968 --> 00:58:03,463
God, help me.
How do I fuck this girl?

1156
00:58:07,537 --> 00:58:08,979
You allright?
- Yeah, yeah. Just,

1157
00:58:09,179 --> 00:58:11,267
Trying to light a fire here.

1158
00:58:16,434 --> 00:58:19,074
That’s it, you’re leaving. Don't get involved.
Go home to your wife.

1159
00:58:29,733 --> 00:58:30,863
As you can probably guess,

1160
00:58:31,063 --> 00:58:34,520
I fucked her goddamn brains out.

1161
00:58:39,149 --> 00:58:40,990
For eleven seconds.

1162
00:58:51,745 --> 00:58:52,841
Did you just cum?

1163
00:58:53,041 --> 00:58:54,040
Oh, yeah. I just came.

1164
00:58:56,261 --> 00:58:58,548
Did you..did you come?
- No.

1165
00:58:58,748 --> 00:58:59,748
No? Okay.

1166
00:58:59,948 --> 00:59:02,624
I'm still hard.
Just give me a sec to get going.

1167
00:59:02,824 --> 00:59:03,823
Sure.

1168
00:59:17,785 --> 00:59:18,608
Oh, God!

1169
00:59:18,808 --> 00:59:19,808
Fuck off, Rocky!

1170
00:59:20,008 --> 00:59:22,277
Bad dog.
- Give him a biscuitt or something..

1171
00:59:22,477 --> 00:59:23,477
It's okay.

1172
00:59:23,677 --> 00:59:24,676
Just keep going.

1173
00:59:24,876 --> 00:59:26,633
Go, play Rocky.
Go..go.

1174
00:59:30,037 --> 00:59:32,149
You're crazy.
<i>I couldn’t get enough</i>.

1175
00:59:32,349 --> 00:59:34,534
I mean, her pussy was like
heroin to me.

1176
00:59:34,958 --> 00:59:37,327
It wasn't just about the sex, either.

1177
00:59:37,527 --> 00:59:38,527
Naomi and I got along.

1178
00:59:38,727 --> 00:59:41,419
I mean, we had similar
interest and shits.

1179
01:00:10,955 --> 01:00:12,095
Woohoo. Shit!

1180
01:00:23,964 --> 01:00:26,251
You, get out of the fucking car!

1181
01:00:27,879 --> 01:00:29,616
Sick son of a bitch.

1182
01:00:31,654 --> 01:00:33,989
Just relax, sweetheart. relax..

1183
01:00:34,804 --> 01:00:37,553
Son of a fucking bitch!

1184
01:00:37,753 --> 01:00:38,753
Stop, please.

1185
01:00:41,673 --> 01:00:42,943
What are you doing home?
- That whore from the party?

1186
01:00:43,313 --> 01:00:44,173
Jesus Christ!

1187
01:00:44,373 --> 01:00:45,373
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1188
01:00:45,643 --> 01:00:48,232
I thought you were at
the fucking beach..

1189
01:00:48,432 --> 01:00:49,432
That's where you've fucking been?

1190
01:00:49,632 --> 01:00:52,141
With that fucking whore
from the party?!

1191
01:00:52,341 --> 01:00:54,701
How could you do this to me?!

1192
01:00:56,422 --> 01:00:57,491
Who the fuck are you, Jordan?

1193
01:00:57,981 --> 01:01:00,738
You’re like a completely different
fucking person!

1194
01:01:00,938 --> 01:01:03,135
I made a mistake,
I don't know what to tell you babe.

1195
01:01:03,335 --> 01:01:04,335
I'm sorry.

1196
01:01:06,233 --> 01:01:08,231
I am sorry.
- Is that what you want?

1197
01:01:18,943 --> 01:01:20,320
Do you love her?

1198
01:01:26,088 --> 01:01:27,439
Answer me.

1199
01:01:49,147 --> 01:01:50,995
I felt horrible.

1200
01:01:51,448 --> 01:01:53,098
Three days later, I filed for divorce

1201
01:01:53,298 --> 01:01:55,961
and moved
Naomi into the apartment.

1202
01:01:59,827 --> 01:02:03,488
Say what you will,
but the Duchess did have style.

1203
01:02:03,688 --> 01:02:06,723
She brought in a decorator,
feng shui’d the place--

1204
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:09,153
she even hired a gay butler.

1205
01:02:09,352 --> 01:02:11,248
This guy was smart, sophisticated,

1206
01:02:11,448 --> 01:02:13,797
professional,
i mean..really, really great.

1207
01:02:13,997 --> 01:02:14,997
Jasmine?

1208
01:02:15,197 --> 01:02:17,811
Yes, Sir. I tried to stump you
this evenning. Very good..

1209
01:02:18,011 --> 01:02:20,315
Very good. Great nose!

1210
01:02:20,515 --> 01:02:22,482
Except for that, one time.

1211
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:28,000
Omigod!

1212
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:31,317
Oh, hey.

1213
01:02:31,517 --> 01:02:33,600
Is it wenesday already?

1214
01:02:35,110 --> 01:02:36,135
What the fuck?

1215
01:02:36,925 --> 01:02:38,095
That is fucked up!

1216
01:02:39,249 --> 01:02:42,199
He must have thought, we're still
at the Hamptons this weekend you know..

1217
01:02:42,399 --> 01:02:44,518
Where were they doing, sweeheart?
In the bedroom? - They're everywhere.

1218
01:02:44,718 --> 01:02:45,718
There were two guys over there
on the table,

1219
01:02:45,918 --> 01:02:47,543
There were more over here.

1220
01:02:47,743 --> 01:02:48,743
They were more right here.
- Oh, God!

1221
01:02:48,943 --> 01:02:51,699
You're fucking serious. Right there?
Why didn't you tell me..

1222
01:02:51,899 --> 01:02:53,934
Baby it gets worse.

1223
01:02:55,385 --> 01:02:57,833
After they left,
I checked the apartment.

1224
01:02:58,033 --> 01:02:59,033
What?

1225
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:01,194
What is it babe?
What?

1226
01:03:01,394 --> 01:03:02,532
Where is my money?

1227
01:03:02,732 --> 01:03:05,787
I don't know where they are.
- Where's my fucking money? Where is it?

1228
01:03:05,987 --> 01:03:07,819
I don't know where your
money is Mr.Belfort.

1229
01:03:08,019 --> 01:03:10,121
I didn’t do anything.
- He's lying Jordan,

1230
01:03:10,321 --> 01:03:11,320
He's lying through his fucking teeth!

1231
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,520
Let' start from the beginning.

1232
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:15,677
Let' start from the beginning. Alright?
You invited friends over, right?

1233
01:03:15,877 --> 01:03:17,675
One thing let to another.
Things got out of hand.

1234
01:03:17,875 --> 01:03:19,151
We understand that, we do.

1235
01:03:19,351 --> 01:03:21,776
We do blow all the time.
We are fucking degenerates ourselves.

1236
01:03:21,976 --> 01:03:22,976
Look at us.

1237
01:03:23,176 --> 01:03:25,977
The money was stolen from my apartment.
Right from my sock drawer.

1238
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:27,177
Alright?
- As I said,

1239
01:03:27,377 --> 01:03:29,274
I don't know about money..
- Just start from the begining.

1240
01:03:29,474 --> 01:03:31,227
Who came over?
- It's just a normal day.

1241
01:03:31,427 --> 01:03:32,426
I knew you're coming home
the next day.

1242
01:03:32,626 --> 01:03:34,660
So, everything will be fine.
It'll be cleaned up.

1243
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:36,527
I got a little high, at breakfast.

1244
01:03:36,727 --> 01:03:38,579
I got a little happy,
I had some eggs,

1245
01:03:38,779 --> 01:03:41,542
I had a little bit of ice cream.
I said, who I knew that likes ice cream.

1246
01:03:41,742 --> 01:03:42,741
That's my frined Rudy.

1247
01:03:42,941 --> 01:03:44,201
So, I call Rudy.
- Who's Rudy?

1248
01:03:44,401 --> 01:03:45,401
Yeah, Who's Rudy?

1249
01:03:46,909 --> 01:03:48,772
You know, who Rudy is.
Come on.

1250
01:03:48,972 --> 01:03:50,259
You know who he is?
- I don't know fuck..

1251
01:03:50,459 --> 01:03:51,936
Who the fuck's Rudy?

1252
01:03:52,136 --> 01:03:54,352
I don't know any one name Rudy.
- Last month, the Lollypop Club.

1253
01:03:54,552 --> 01:03:55,739
You know who Rudy was, dancing.

1254
01:03:55,939 --> 01:03:59,200
You know...Rudy?
- I don't..I..I eh..

1255
01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:01,129
What do you mean?

1256
01:04:01,329 --> 01:04:02,329
So, he went to the Lollypop Club?

1257
01:04:02,489 --> 01:04:06,131
Oh, he was at the Lollypop club for sure.
On the stage, griding with everybody..

1258
01:04:06,331 --> 01:04:07,331
I got fucked up.
I like to dance...

1259
01:04:08,811 --> 01:04:10,682
Maybe, I met him. Maybe I didn't..
I meet a lot of fucking peoplel.

1260
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:14,250
Fifty thousand dollars was stolen from
my fucking socks drawer.

1261
01:04:14,707 --> 01:04:16,557
All my girlfriend's jewellery..

1262
01:04:17,337 --> 01:04:18,407
What the fuck?
- Your fucking faggot friend..

1263
01:04:18,607 --> 01:04:19,607
..Rudy take my shit.

1264
01:04:19,877 --> 01:04:21,227
Did he? Answer me.

1265
01:04:21,427 --> 01:04:22,959
Okay, now I get it.

1266
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:24,158
Now I get why.

1267
01:04:24,456 --> 01:04:26,736
This is a gay thing. I see.
All of you.

1268
01:04:26,936 --> 01:04:29,184
You think this is b'cos you're fag?

1269
01:04:29,384 --> 01:04:31,086
My cousin is a fucking faggot.

1270
01:04:31,286 --> 01:04:34,035
And I go on vacation with him and
his boyfriend. I love fags!

1271
01:04:34,742 --> 01:04:36,694
I will not be stolen from.
You get that?

1272
01:04:36,894 --> 01:04:38,701
I fucking like gay people.
But I don't like you.

1273
01:04:48,625 --> 01:04:50,316
Talk, you fuck. Talk!

1274
01:04:50,516 --> 01:04:52,485
I'm gonna drop you, fucking..
Where is it?

1275
01:04:53,085 --> 01:04:55,937
Chester and Toby
they went all Yakuza on Nicholas.

1276
01:04:56,137 --> 01:04:57,137
They got crazy.

1277
01:04:58,964 --> 01:05:01,084
I had to call the cops
just to keep em for killing the poor guy.

1278
01:05:02,144 --> 01:05:05,272
I gave 'em each a thousand bucks
and told them what Nicholas had done.

1279
01:05:05,472 --> 01:05:07,307
And they kicked his ass.

1280
01:05:07,533 --> 01:05:08,879
Thanks again, officers.

1281
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:12,012
It's not like I cared about
the fifty grand anyway.

1282
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:15,192
I was making that much alnost
everyday through one rathole or the other.

1283
01:05:16,382 --> 01:05:17,502
Now, 'rathole' is a friend.

1284
01:05:18,062 --> 01:05:18,922
Like, Brad here.

1285
01:05:19,282 --> 01:05:22,038
Who helps stock in his name from me.

1286
01:05:24,694 --> 01:05:26,037
I drive the price up.

1287
01:05:26,237 --> 01:05:28,845
Then, he'd sell and kick
most of the profit back to..

1288
01:05:29,045 --> 01:05:31,024
You guessed it.. me.

1289
01:05:33,929 --> 01:05:35,680
All cash.
None of it on the books.

1290
01:05:36,101 --> 01:05:38,480
A big 'no, no' of course
in the eyes of the law.

1291
01:05:39,011 --> 01:05:42,524
Enter our new Securities Attorney,
Manny Riskin.

1292
01:05:42,724 --> 01:05:44,941
700 bucks an hour,
to be the voice..

1293
01:05:45,601 --> 01:05:46,943
..of DOOM.
- Listen to me,

1294
01:05:47,143 --> 01:05:49,432
You piss on the SEC’s leg,
you’ll end up with your tits in a ringer.

1295
01:05:49,632 --> 01:05:51,972
Will you not worry about it.
I got the SEC in control.

1296
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,710
What the fuck is this imbecile doing?!

1297
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:57,678
Hey, hey. What're you doing?

1298
01:05:57,679 --> 01:06:00,178
Hey! We got the SEC in here.

1299
01:06:00,179 --> 01:06:04,996
The Securities and Exchange Commission
sent two lawyers down to review our files,

1300
01:06:05,196 --> 01:06:07,159
so, I set them  up in our conference room.

1301
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:10,369
And, I had it bugged
and the air conditioning turned up so high,

1302
01:06:10,569 --> 01:06:12,425
that it felt like Antarctica in there.

1303
01:06:12,625 --> 01:06:13,625
Is it always this cold in here?

1304
01:06:13,998 --> 01:06:14,858
I don't know.

1305
01:06:15,178 --> 01:06:18,486
Then, while they were, looking
for a smoking gun in that room.

1306
01:06:20,598 --> 01:06:22,758
I was gonna fire off a bazooka in here.

1307
01:06:23,378 --> 01:06:25,268
Offering up our latest IPO.

1308
01:06:25,778 --> 01:06:27,757
An IPO is an initial public offering,

1309
01:06:28,387 --> 01:06:32,078
the first time a stock is offered
for sale to the general population.

1310
01:06:32,177 --> 01:06:34,156
Now, as the firm taking the company public,

1311
01:06:34,356 --> 01:06:38,036
We set the initial price, then
sold those shares back to our friends.

1312
01:06:38,236 --> 01:06:39,236
Look,

1313
01:06:40,046 --> 01:06:42,236
I know, you're not following what I’m saying.
Anyway, right?

1314
01:06:42,436 --> 01:06:44,141
That's okay.
That doesn't matter.

1315
01:06:44,341 --> 01:06:45,878
The real question is this,

1316
01:06:46,078 --> 01:06:47,571
“was all this legal?”

1317
01:06:48,315 --> 01:06:50,307
Absolutely, fucking not!

1318
01:06:50,507 --> 01:06:52,974
But, we were making more money
that we knew what to do.

1319
01:06:57,188 --> 01:06:59,554
What do you do, when you're making more
money than, you know what to do with?

1320
01:07:06,186 --> 01:07:07,594
Omigod!!

1321
01:07:07,794 --> 01:07:08,793
Will you marry me?

1322
01:07:08,993 --> 01:07:10,788
Omigod!

1323
01:07:10,988 --> 01:07:12,833
Is that a 'Yes'?

1324
01:07:14,395 --> 01:07:17,212
Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah, I'm sure.

1325
01:07:17,412 --> 01:07:19,255
Are you sure?
-  Yeah!

1326
01:07:29,448 --> 01:07:33,184
I held my bachelor party
at the Mirage, in Las Vegas.

1327
01:07:33,384 --> 01:07:35,497
The flight there alone,
was a Baccanal!

1328
01:07:35,697 --> 01:07:39,027
One last blowout for the Gods
before I settled down for good.

1329
01:07:39,806 --> 01:07:40,846
A hundred Strattonites.

1330
01:07:41,996 --> 01:07:45,115
Fifty hookers plus fifty more
waiting once we landed.

1331
01:07:45,486 --> 01:07:46,822
Oh, and the drugs..I mean,

1332
01:07:47,022 --> 01:07:50,263
I tell you our plane
was a pharmacy with wings.

1333
01:08:19,864 --> 01:08:20,640
All told,

1334
01:08:20,839 --> 01:08:23,798
the weekend cost me two million bucks.

1335
01:08:24,318 --> 01:08:26,998
Including the cost of refurbishing
the entire 28th floor.

1336
01:08:29,433 --> 01:08:30,904
Kiss the bride.

1337
01:08:33,078 --> 01:08:35,758
But, the wedding was like
something out of a fairy tale.

1338
01:08:36,118 --> 01:08:38,408
--with Naomi my Duchess,

1339
01:08:39,168 --> 01:08:40,548
me her handsome Duke..

1340
01:08:41,108 --> 01:08:44,198
..and The Bahamas Ocean Club
our castle.

1341
01:08:54,585 --> 01:08:56,025
Of course, after that bachelor party,

1342
01:08:56,026 --> 01:08:59,806
Me..the Duke needed a few
penicillin shots so he could..

1343
01:09:00,456 --> 01:09:02,195
..safely consummate, the marriage.

1344
01:09:07,965 --> 01:09:09,555
Hey..I’m Barry Kleinman,
filming the wedding.

1345
01:09:09,755 --> 01:09:11,524
A few words, huh.
For your son.

1346
01:09:11,724 --> 01:09:13,354
Jordan, remember what I told you.

1347
01:09:13,724 --> 01:09:15,384
It involves your penis..

1348
01:09:16,034 --> 01:09:17,153
...and her vagina.

1349
01:09:17,353 --> 01:09:19,030
You know, you know it.

1350
01:09:19,415 --> 01:09:20,790
You can do it, Jordy.

1351
01:09:38,098 --> 01:09:40,063
Omigod!
Aunt Emma!

1352
01:09:44,362 --> 01:09:45,657
Oh, God!
You came!

1353
01:09:47,331 --> 01:09:48,123
Jordan!

1354
01:09:48,323 --> 01:09:49,647
Jordan! Look, who came.

1355
01:09:50,562 --> 01:09:51,707
It's Aunt Emma.

1356
01:09:52,232 --> 01:09:53,866
Aunt Emma!

1357
01:09:54,641 --> 01:09:56,101
Jordan dear, how lovely.
- Hey, how're you doing?

1358
01:09:56,871 --> 01:09:58,261
Pleasure to finally meet you,

1359
01:09:58,461 --> 01:09:59,898
in person.

1360
01:10:00,391 --> 01:10:01,471
Into the donuts, I see.

1361
01:10:02,391 --> 01:10:05,531
Oh, I’m--- uh...

1362
01:10:06,791 --> 01:10:07,971
I lived through the 60s, my dear.

1363
01:10:08,481 --> 01:10:09,731
Enjoy the day.

1364
01:10:10,566 --> 01:10:11,771
She surprised me!

1365
01:10:12,761 --> 01:10:14,026
I didn't even know.
- It's huge honour.

1366
01:10:27,693 --> 01:10:29,593
Just one more step. Keep your eyes closed.
- Where are we going?

1367
01:10:30,781 --> 01:10:31,919
One, Two..three!

1368
01:10:34,805 --> 01:10:35,750
What is this?

1369
01:10:35,950 --> 01:10:37,449
It's your wedding present!
- What?

1370
01:10:37,649 --> 01:10:40,003
It's your wedding, sweetheart.

1371
01:10:42,064 --> 01:10:43,873
Are you serious?

1372
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:46,176
A fucking Yacht?!

1373
01:10:46,376 --> 01:10:48,861
<i>For millionaires,
who's ships have come in.</i>

1374
01:10:49,061 --> 01:10:51,363
<i>Priceless boats offers
the most fun afloat.</i>

1375
01:10:51,833 --> 01:10:54,112
<i>It's no coincidence that
this 150 feet..</i>

1376
01:10:54,312 --> 01:10:56,211
<i>..of Steel hull
is the color of cash.</i>

1377
01:10:56,411 --> 01:10:57,411
Anchors Away!

1378
01:10:57,547 --> 01:10:58,627
Oh, my God!

1379
01:10:58,827 --> 01:10:59,827
Baby!

1380
01:11:01,867 --> 01:11:02,807
Do you like it?

1381
01:11:03,007 --> 01:11:05,196
You like it?
Yes!

1382
01:11:10,752 --> 01:11:13,528
For three weeks, we sailed the Naomi
through the Caribbean.

1383
01:11:13,728 --> 01:11:14,728
Eventually, taking her home
to Long Island,

1384
01:11:14,928 --> 01:11:16,982
where we’d bought a house.

1385
01:11:17,182 --> 01:11:19,414
Seven acres on the
Gold Coast of Long Island.

1386
01:11:19,415 --> 01:11:21,914
The most expensive
real estate in the world,

1387
01:11:21,915 --> 01:11:24,414
with maids, cooks,
landscapers, you name it.

1388
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:26,534
We even had two guards
who worked in shifts,

1389
01:11:26,994 --> 01:11:29,436
Both, named Rocco.

1390
01:11:32,547 --> 01:11:34,467
It was heaven on earth.

1391
01:11:37,734 --> 01:11:39,214
Wake up, you piece of shit!

1392
01:11:39,414 --> 01:11:40,414
Who’s Venice?

1393
01:11:40,614 --> 01:11:41,614
Who?

1394
01:11:42,494 --> 01:11:45,121
Who? - Who?
What are you a fucking owl?!

1395
01:11:45,321 --> 01:11:46,321
Who's she?

1396
01:11:46,521 --> 01:11:48,068
Some little hooker
you were fucking last night?

1397
01:11:48,268 --> 01:11:49,268
What the fuck
are you talking about?!

1398
01:11:49,468 --> 01:11:50,468
No. No, way!
Baby.

1399
01:11:51,043 --> 01:11:51,648
No!

1400
01:11:51,848 --> 01:11:53,928
You were calling her name
in your sleep.

1401
01:11:54,128 --> 01:11:55,128
Are you out
of you fucking mind?!

1402
01:11:55,328 --> 01:11:58,805
I don't..I don't
even know who Venice is.

1403
01:11:59,005 --> 01:12:01,064
What the fuck does that even mean?
Venice.

1404
01:12:01,264 --> 01:12:04,045
That's the stupidiest shit i've ever
heard in my fucking life!

1405
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:09,267
Venice?

1406
01:12:10,702 --> 01:12:12,622
Venice baby
where are you?

1407
01:12:12,822 --> 01:12:13,822
Venice?

1408
01:12:15,771 --> 01:12:17,099
Venice?!

1409
01:12:17,299 --> 01:12:18,298
Where did you go? Huh?

1410
01:12:24,126 --> 01:12:25,503
You're going rough huh?

1411
01:12:25,703 --> 01:12:27,525
Ah..! Jesus Christ!

1412
01:12:30,024 --> 01:12:31,640
I like it. I like it.

1413
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:32,840
Wolfie..wolfie. Wolfie!
Wolfie.

1414
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,040
Wolfie.

1415
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:36,124
Wolfie?
- Yes, it's my 'safe' word baby.

1416
01:12:36,324 --> 01:12:37,324
It's my 'safe' word!
- I don't give a fuck,

1417
01:12:37,524 --> 01:12:38,524
about your safe word.

1418
01:12:38,723 --> 01:12:39,723
Shut the fuck up!

1419
01:12:41,521 --> 01:12:42,793
Shut up, you little bitch.

1420
01:12:42,993 --> 01:12:45,557
You fucking dirty little birdie!

1421
01:12:46,764 --> 01:12:48,037
That's right!

1422
01:12:48,237 --> 01:12:49,236
That's right, I forgot.

1423
01:12:50,426 --> 01:12:51,138
I forgot baby.

1424
01:12:51,338 --> 01:12:52,338
Donnie and I,

1425
01:12:52,548 --> 01:12:55,583
we’re investing in
a condo complex in Venice.

1426
01:12:55,783 --> 01:12:57,491
That's why..that's why all this confusion.
- Oh, you're investing in Italy?

1427
01:12:58,578 --> 01:13:00,402
Not Italy.
California, baby.

1428
01:13:00,602 --> 01:13:01,602
Oh, California?
- Yeah.

1429
01:13:01,802 --> 01:13:02,802
You're a lying piece of shit!

1430
01:13:03,297 --> 01:13:05,610
Duchess, baby, come on.
- Don’t you fucking ‘Duchess’ me.

1431
01:13:05,810 --> 01:13:06,810
Don’t you ‘Duchess’ me.

1432
01:13:07,010 --> 01:13:08,868
I'm sorry.
- Do you really think,

1433
01:13:09,068 --> 01:13:10,067
That, I don’t know
what you’re up to?

1434
01:13:10,267 --> 01:13:12,676
You’re a father now, Jordan.
Yeah.

1435
01:13:12,876 --> 01:13:16,400
You’re a father now
and you act like an infant!

1436
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:17,600
Fuck.

1437
01:13:18,767 --> 01:13:21,642
Goddamn it! Baby, you know.
You got real anger issues!

1438
01:13:21,842 --> 01:13:23,856
Who was the one who flew in here,

1439
01:13:24,206 --> 01:13:27,265
at three in the morning
on a stupid helicopter..

1440
01:13:27,465 --> 01:13:28,465
And, woke up Skylar?!

1441
01:13:28,665 --> 01:13:30,476
That was you.
How about that?

1442
01:13:30,676 --> 01:13:32,834
Does it even matters to you?
- Fucking bullshit!

1443
01:13:42,844 --> 01:13:44,444
Does it even matter to you,

1444
01:13:44,644 --> 01:13:46,977
that I just had that
driving range..

1445
01:13:47,177 --> 01:13:48,177
sodded with Bermuda..

1446
01:13:48,377 --> 01:13:50,485
grass, Jordan?

1447
01:13:50,685 --> 01:13:51,684
And, now..
you fucking wrecked it.

1448
01:13:51,884 --> 01:13:54,018
No. You didn't
researched the whole thing

1449
01:13:54,218 --> 01:13:56,523
and dealt with the fucking
golf course people!

1450
01:13:57,044 --> 01:13:59,942
Oh, my God! You had to deal with
the gold course people too!

1451
01:14:00,194 --> 01:14:02,954
What a great tragedy.
Honey, Oh my God!

1452
01:14:03,154 --> 01:14:04,154
You probably had to pay
them in cash..

1453
01:14:04,354 --> 01:14:07,149
..with your hands,
What a fucking burden.

1454
01:14:07,349 --> 01:14:08,349
And actually,
do some work besides,

1455
01:14:08,549 --> 01:14:11,673
swiping my fucking credit card
all day, huh?

1456
01:14:11,873 --> 01:14:14,009
Cos, I can't keep track of
your professions honey.

1457
01:14:14,209 --> 01:14:16,034
Cos last month,
you're a wine connoisseur.

1458
01:14:16,234 --> 01:14:18,584
Now, you’re an aspiring landscape architect?!

1459
01:14:18,784 --> 01:14:20,507
Let me get that right.
- Fuck you!

1460
01:14:20,707 --> 01:14:23,184
Don't fucking dare..
throw that fucking water at me.

1461
01:14:23,384 --> 01:14:24,753
Don't fucking dare.

1462
01:14:24,953 --> 01:14:25,953
All right, honey?

1463
01:14:28,889 --> 01:14:29,977
We can talk this out. Alright?

1464
01:14:30,177 --> 01:14:31,177
We'll just use our words.

1465
01:14:31,377 --> 01:14:32,376
You know?

1466
01:14:32,576 --> 01:14:35,157
Communicate. Okay?

1467
01:14:36,359 --> 01:14:39,095
Come on, sweetheart.
Talk to me..talk to me.

1468
01:14:39,295 --> 01:14:41,606
Stop flexing your muscless,
Jordan.

1469
01:14:41,806 --> 01:14:42,805
You look like a fucking imbecile.

1470
01:14:43,005 --> 01:14:44,997
Babe, come on.
You should feel..

1471
01:14:45,197 --> 01:14:47,447
..feel happy you got a husband..

1472
01:14:47,647 --> 01:14:50,315
Who's in such great shape
like this, Huh?

1473
01:14:50,515 --> 01:14:51,515
Come here.

1474
01:14:51,715 --> 01:14:53,523
C'mon, give me a kiss.

1475
01:14:53,723 --> 01:14:55,588
You look so beautiful
right now. C'mon!

1476
01:14:55,788 --> 01:14:56,788
Kiss you?

1477
01:14:56,988 --> 01:14:58,403
Kiss you?
- Yeah, give me one...

1478
01:15:00,051 --> 01:15:01,364
Fuck You!

1479
01:15:01,564 --> 01:15:02,564
Ah yes..

1480
01:15:02,959 --> 01:15:03,836
My morning ritual.

1481
01:15:04,036 --> 01:15:08,132
First, I’d get up and fight with Naomi
about whatever I did the night before.

1482
01:15:08,478 --> 01:15:09,648
Next it was a steam,

1483
01:15:09,848 --> 01:15:12,453
so, I could sweat out the drugs,
still in my system.

1484
01:15:12,653 --> 01:15:13,717
Then. I’d assess the damage.

1485
01:15:13,917 --> 01:15:15,454
Drown out my eyeballs..

1486
01:15:16,759 --> 01:15:18,991
take my “back pills”
to get the day started,

1487
01:15:19,191 --> 01:15:21,464
then, seek to make up
with Naomi.

1488
01:15:21,664 --> 01:15:22,664
Good morning Daddy.

1489
01:15:22,864 --> 01:15:25,227
Where’s my kiss?

1490
01:15:30,104 --> 01:15:33,679
Does Daddy get to kiss
both his little girls, huh?

1491
01:15:33,879 --> 01:15:34,878
Ohhh, no!

1492
01:15:35,078 --> 01:15:38,059
No, Daddy doesn't even get
to touch Mommy..

1493
01:15:38,259 --> 01:15:41,902
for a very, very..
very long time.

1494
01:15:42,633 --> 01:15:45,008
Daddy is really sorry about
what he said in the other room,

1495
01:15:45,208 --> 01:15:46,208
He didn't mean any of it.

1496
01:15:46,408 --> 01:15:48,596
Daddy shouldn’t waste his time.

1497
01:15:48,796 --> 01:15:50,986
And, from now on..

1498
01:15:52,422 --> 01:15:57,077
it's going to be nothing but short,
short skirts around the house!

1499
01:15:59,731 --> 01:16:02,019
And, you know something else, Daddy?

1500
01:16:03,748 --> 01:16:09,236
And Mommy’s so sick and tired
of wearing panties,

1501
01:16:11,156 --> 01:16:12,924
Yeah?
- Yeah.

1502
01:16:15,574 --> 01:16:17,479
In fact..

1503
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:24,649
she’s decided to throw them all away.

1504
01:16:30,627 --> 01:16:32,564
So, take a good look, Daddy.

1505
01:16:32,764 --> 01:16:36,332
You’re gonna be seeing an awful lot
of this around the house,

1506
01:16:39,481 --> 01:16:42,218
but, no touching.

1507
01:16:48,202 --> 01:16:50,378
What’s wrong, Daddy?

1508
01:16:56,318 --> 01:16:57,917
Look at this shit.

1509
01:16:58,797 --> 01:17:01,278
Mommy, likes to play games with daddy.

1510
01:17:03,298 --> 01:17:09,413
Mommy, have you ever notice,
anything odd about Mr.Fuzzy Bear, over there?

1511
01:17:11,886 --> 01:17:14,463
His eye seems to be a little
bit odd, Don't they?

1512
01:17:14,663 --> 01:17:18,867
Yeah, there's something a little bit
different about his eyes.

1513
01:17:19,067 --> 01:17:20,067
Hah! Yes,

1514
01:17:20,267 --> 01:17:21,942
I think it's true.Say, 'Hi, Mommy',

1515
01:17:22,142 --> 01:17:24,031
Say, 'Hi' to Rocco and Rocco.

1516
01:17:24,231 --> 01:17:25,231
Hi, fellas!

1517
01:17:25,431 --> 01:17:26,431
See that, huh?

1518
01:17:26,518 --> 01:17:30,337
Of all the fucking days,
she choose just today to give me blue balls.

1519
01:17:30,847 --> 01:17:33,646
Today's the biggest day
in Stratten's history.

1520
01:17:33,846 --> 01:17:35,557
And, I needed to be thinking straight.

1521
01:17:35,757 --> 01:17:36,757
Hey,Jordan.

1522
01:17:37,348 --> 01:17:38,948
Welcome.
- Steve here yet?

1523
01:17:39,148 --> 01:17:42,875
This was the day, that we launched
the Steve Madden IPO.

1524
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:44,976
The troops are all here.
Everyone's rallied, excited.

1525
01:17:45,176 --> 01:17:48,107
Everything had to run tight.
It had to be perfect.

1526
01:17:48,307 --> 01:17:49,307
What the fuck is that kid doing?

1527
01:17:50,751 --> 01:17:51,920
What's he doing?

1528
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:56,286
The biggest IPO in this firm’s history,
What the fuck is he doing?

1529
01:17:58,064 --> 01:17:59,695
Is he wearing a bow-tie?

1530
01:17:59,895 --> 01:18:00,895
Hi.

1531
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:04,105
How're you doing?
- Good.

1532
01:18:05,588 --> 01:18:07,293
You cleaning your fishbowl?

1533
01:18:08,753 --> 01:18:10,120
I just..I had a minute.

1534
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:11,320
You had a minute.

1535
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,969
And, today..you needed
to clean your fish bowl. Today?

1536
01:18:14,169 --> 01:18:17,877
I had finished my paperwork and
I was..just had a couple of minutes.

1537
01:18:18,077 --> 01:18:19,076
Okay.

1538
01:18:19,276 --> 01:18:21,346
Nice to meet you.

1539
01:18:26,314 --> 01:18:27,744
On new issue day?!

1540
01:18:29,034 --> 01:18:31,650
On cocksucking, motherfucking
new issue day?!

1541
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:33,568
This is what you do?!

1542
01:18:33,768 --> 01:18:34,768
Hey, everybody?!

1543
01:18:34,968 --> 01:18:35,968
Listen up.

1544
01:18:36,168 --> 01:18:40,097
This is what happens when you fuck
with your pets on new issue day!

1545
01:18:53,195 --> 01:18:54,315
Now take your bowtie,

1546
01:18:54,515 --> 01:18:55,515
get your shit, and..

1547
01:18:55,715 --> 01:18:58,528
get the fuck out of my office, you understand?
- Get the fuck out!

1548
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:03,350
Everybody on point!

1549
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:06,809
We are here, to make money.
Everybody on point!

1550
01:19:09,602 --> 01:19:10,808
A real wolf pit.

1551
01:19:11,008 --> 01:19:12,008
Which is exactly, how I liked it.

1552
01:19:12,208 --> 01:19:14,879
Jordan. Look what I caught in the lobby?
I caught a genius.

1553
01:19:15,079 --> 01:19:16,090
Enter, Steve Madden.

1554
01:19:17,630 --> 01:19:19,340
Red Hot ladies footwear <i>impresario</i>.

1555
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:22,949
And, thanks to Donnie,
We were taking his company public.

1556
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:27,435
Stratten Oakmont was crawling out
of it's primerial loose.

1557
01:19:27,635 --> 01:19:29,237
Pond scum, no more.

1558
01:19:29,437 --> 01:19:31,357
That's why they gotta see your face.

1559
01:19:31,557 --> 01:19:32,557
You get ‘em fired up so they’ll push
the shit out of this stock.

1560
01:19:33,158 --> 01:19:34,818
Okay?
<i>And not only that.</i>

1561
01:19:35,321 --> 01:19:39,017
Donnie and I secretly owned 85%
of Steve Madden shoes.

1562
01:19:39,438 --> 01:19:41,377
Which legally speaking was a big NO NO.

1563
01:19:41,576 --> 01:19:44,680
But, we'll get filthy fucking rich,
If our troops got behind it.

1564
01:19:45,377 --> 01:19:46,667
Our job was to get 'em worked up.

1565
01:19:47,667 --> 01:19:48,587
But, not too worked up.

1566
01:19:50,477 --> 01:19:51,377
Hello, if uh..

1567
01:19:53,206 --> 01:19:54,537
For those of you who don't know me,

1568
01:19:55,817 --> 01:19:57,127
..my name is Steve Madden.

1569
01:19:57,327 --> 01:19:58,327
Yeah, we know who you are.

1570
01:19:58,527 --> 01:19:59,527
Your name is on the box.

1571
01:19:59,727 --> 01:20:02,625
The shoes. Show them the shoes.
Show them the shoes.

1572
01:20:02,825 --> 01:20:07,316
This shoe..it is pretty cool.
This is the Mary Lou..

1573
01:20:07,826 --> 01:20:09,569
Which is the one that really
put me on the map.

1574
01:20:09,769 --> 01:20:10,769
Without it, I wouldn't be here.

1575
01:20:11,976 --> 01:20:13,353
Believe it or not.

1576
01:20:13,553 --> 01:20:14,553
Believe it or not, though.

1577
01:20:14,753 --> 01:20:17,117
The Mary Lou is actually
the same as the Mary Jane.

1578
01:20:17,317 --> 01:20:19,191
But, it's black leather.

1579
01:20:26,844 --> 01:20:28,054
All right,

1580
01:20:29,164 --> 01:20:31,964
let's give it up for Steve Madden
and his awesome Mary Lou!

1581
01:20:32,164 --> 01:20:33,440
Hold that up, hold that up.

1582
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:36,128
Hold that up, proud.
Give him a round of applause.

1583
01:20:37,763 --> 01:20:40,142
You got that out of your system, huh?

1584
01:20:40,924 --> 01:20:42,925
You're having a good afternoon or what?

1585
01:20:43,843 --> 01:20:46,463
I wanna take a moment to
tell you why Steve is so..

1586
01:20:46,663 --> 01:20:49,406
Absolutely, off the fucking wall.

1587
01:20:49,606 --> 01:20:53,977
It’s because this man is a creative genius.

1588
01:20:54,792 --> 01:20:57,628
This ability, this gift that
Steve has..

1589
01:20:57,842 --> 01:20:59,042
it goes beyond just..

1590
01:20:59,242 --> 01:21:01,667
spotting the hottest shoe trends.

1591
01:21:01,867 --> 01:21:05,184
Steve's power, is that
he creates trends.

1592
01:21:05,384 --> 01:21:06,384
You understand?

1593
01:21:07,151 --> 01:21:09,364
Artists like Steve come along
once every decade!

1594
01:21:09,564 --> 01:21:11,652
I'm talking, Giorgio Armani!
Gianni Versace!

1595
01:21:11,852 --> 01:21:13,931
CoCo Chanel! Yves Saint Laurent!

1596
01:21:14,131 --> 01:21:16,542
Steve, come up here for a second.

1597
01:21:16,742 --> 01:21:17,742
I don't think you all realise..

1598
01:21:19,686 --> 01:21:23,037
that Steve Madden is
the hottest person,

1599
01:21:23,237 --> 01:21:24,237
in the women shoe industry,

1600
01:21:24,438 --> 01:21:29,389
with orders going through the roof at every
department store in North America, right now.

1601
01:21:29,950 --> 01:21:32,226
We have him here in our office.

1602
01:21:33,258 --> 01:21:35,833
We should thank our fucking
lucky stars this man is here.

1603
01:21:36,033 --> 01:21:38,286
We should be on our
hands and knees right now,

1604
01:21:38,486 --> 01:21:40,646
getting ready to suck this guy off.

1605
01:21:41,799 --> 01:21:43,309
Like this, okay?

1606
01:21:43,509 --> 01:21:44,529
I wanna suck you off, Steve.

1607
01:21:45,878 --> 01:21:46,908
Everyone's gonna suck you off.

1608
01:21:48,198 --> 01:21:52,238
This is our golden ticket to the
fucking chocolate factory, right here.

1609
01:21:52,868 --> 01:21:55,707
And, I wanna meet
Willy 'Fucking' Wonka. Okay?

1610
01:21:56,837 --> 01:21:59,637
I wanna be with the fucking
Oompa Loompas like this.

1611
01:22:04,439 --> 01:22:06,124
Get off this fucking stage.
Get out of here.

1612
01:22:06,324 --> 01:22:07,324
All right.

1613
01:22:07,356 --> 01:22:08,576
I want you all to focus for a second.

1614
01:22:09,827 --> 01:22:11,478
See that little black boxes?

1615
01:22:11,678 --> 01:22:12,678
They are called a telephones.

1616
01:22:12,878 --> 01:22:15,247
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret
about this telephones.

1617
01:22:15,447 --> 01:22:17,864
They're not gonna
dial themselves! Okay?

1618
01:22:18,806 --> 01:22:19,676
Without you...

1619
01:22:19,876 --> 01:22:22,621
They're just worthless hunk of plastic.

1620
01:22:22,821 --> 01:22:24,691
like a loaded M16 without a..

1621
01:22:24,891 --> 01:22:26,879
..trained Marine to pull the trigger.

1622
01:22:27,901 --> 01:22:29,628
And in the case of the telephone,

1623
01:22:29,828 --> 01:22:32,688
It's up to each and everyone of you,

1624
01:22:34,581 --> 01:22:36,325
My highly trained Strattonite,

1625
01:22:37,574 --> 01:22:38,514
My killers

1626
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:42,774
My Killers who will not take
no for an answer!

1627
01:22:42,974 --> 01:22:45,276
My fucking warriors

1628
01:22:45,734 --> 01:22:47,293
who'll not hang up the phone,

1629
01:22:47,733 --> 01:22:50,393
until their clients either buys..

1630
01:22:50,803 --> 01:22:54,477
... or fucking dies!

1631
01:23:07,433 --> 01:23:09,092
Let me tell you something.

1632
01:23:09,802 --> 01:23:12,002
There is no nobility in poverty.

1633
01:23:13,422 --> 01:23:15,622
I've been rich, and I've been poor man.

1634
01:23:15,822 --> 01:23:18,643
and I choose rich every time.

1635
01:23:20,021 --> 01:23:22,852
Cos, At least as a rich man,
when I have to face my problems,

1636
01:23:23,052 --> 01:23:24,052
I show up in the back of a limo

1637
01:23:24,751 --> 01:23:26,051
wearing a $2000 suit

1638
01:23:26,761 --> 01:23:28,760
..and $40,000 gold fuckin' watch!

1639
01:23:37,231 --> 01:23:39,619
Now, if anyone here thinks
I'm superficial..

1640
01:23:40,089 --> 01:23:41,801
...or materialistic.

1641
01:23:43,050 --> 01:23:46,875
Go get the fuck out and get a job at McDonald’s,
because that's where you fucking belong!

1642
01:23:48,180 --> 01:23:51,179
But, before you depart this
room full of winners,

1643
01:23:52,729 --> 01:23:55,601
I want you to take a good look at
the person next to you, go on.

1644
01:23:57,024 --> 01:23:58,599
because one day in the
not-so-distant future,

1645
01:23:59,339 --> 01:24:01,968
you're pullin' up to a red light
in your beat-up old Pinto,

1646
01:24:03,148 --> 01:24:05,918
and that person’s gonna pull up
right along side you

1647
01:24:06,118 --> 01:24:08,615
in a brand new Porsche,

1648
01:24:08,815 --> 01:24:13,482
with their gorgeous young wife
by his side. Who's got big voluptous tits.

1649
01:24:14,767 --> 01:24:17,166
And who will you be next to?

1650
01:24:17,366 --> 01:24:22,222
Some disgusting wilderbeast with three days of
razor-stubble in a sleeveless moo-moo,

1651
01:24:22,422 --> 01:24:26,166
crammed in next to you with a carload full
of groceries from the fucking Price Club!

1652
01:24:26,527 --> 01:24:27,727
That's who you're gonna
be sitting next to.

1653
01:24:28,937 --> 01:24:30,466
So, you listen to me and you listen well.

1654
01:24:31,006 --> 01:24:33,116
Are you behind,
on your credit card bills?

1655
01:24:33,886 --> 01:24:35,366
Good.
Pick up the phone and start dialing.

1656
01:24:36,546 --> 01:24:38,606
Is your landlord ready to evict you?

1657
01:24:38,926 --> 01:24:41,045
Good.
Pick up the phone and start dialing.

1658
01:24:41,665 --> 01:24:44,175
Does your girlfriend think
you're a fucking loser?

1659
01:24:45,355 --> 01:24:47,695
Good.
Pick up the phone and start dialing!

1660
01:24:48,305 --> 01:24:49,565
I want you to deal with
your problems,

1661
01:24:50,115 --> 01:24:51,574
by becoming rich!

1662
01:24:53,634 --> 01:24:55,084
All you have to do today

1663
01:24:55,524 --> 01:24:56,514
..is pick up that phone..

1664
01:24:58,483 --> 01:25:00,863
And speak the words that
I have taught you.

1665
01:25:01,063 --> 01:25:03,116
And I'll make you richer

1666
01:25:03,316 --> 01:25:07,157
than the most powerful CEO of
the United States of fucking America.

1667
01:25:10,493 --> 01:25:11,614
I want you to go out there,

1668
01:25:14,025 --> 01:25:15,200
And I want you to ram

1669
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:18,893
Steve Madden stock down
your clients’ throats

1670
01:25:19,093 --> 01:25:21,414
Till they fucking choke on it

1671
01:25:21,962 --> 01:25:26,472
till they choke on it and buy 10,000 shares!
That's what I want you to do.

1672
01:25:27,152 --> 01:25:28,722
You'll Be ferocious!

1673
01:25:29,702 --> 01:25:31,164
You'll Be relentless!

1674
01:25:31,364 --> 01:25:35,023
You'll Be telephone fucking terrorists!

1675
01:25:36,391 --> 01:25:40,960
Now, let's knock this Motherfucker
out of the park!

1676
01:26:09,899 --> 01:26:14,993
At 1 p.m. we opened
the stock for sale at $4.50 a share.

1677
01:26:15,193 --> 01:26:17,728
By 1:03 it was over eighteen dollars.

1678
01:26:18,328 --> 01:26:20,178
Even the big Wall Street firms
were buying.

1679
01:26:30,675 --> 01:26:32,415
Of the two million shares
being offered for sale,

1680
01:26:32,615 --> 01:26:35,362
a million belonged to me,
held in phony accounts by my ratholes.

1681
01:26:35,562 --> 01:26:37,561
Now, once the price hit the high teens,

1682
01:26:38,286 --> 01:26:39,996
You know what?
Who gives a shit.

1683
01:26:40,196 --> 01:26:41,196
As always, the point is this--

1684
01:26:41,396 --> 01:26:46,750
22 million in three fucking hours!

1685
01:26:47,616 --> 01:26:48,846
Can you believe it.

1686
01:26:52,084 --> 01:26:53,142
Jordan.

1687
01:26:53,342 --> 01:26:55,950
Barry Kleinman's on the phone
from Future Video.

1688
01:26:56,150 --> 01:26:57,925
A who?
- I don't know. He shot at your wedding.

1689
01:26:58,125 --> 01:26:59,125
He says, it's urgent.

1690
01:26:59,325 --> 01:27:00,325
Urgent? Who the fuck's Barry Kleinman?

1691
01:27:01,258 --> 01:27:03,875
Oh, my God. You wanna marry me?
You're in love with me?

1692
01:27:04,175 --> 01:27:05,174
Yeah, go fuck your cousin.

1693
01:27:05,374 --> 01:27:06,374
Barry, what's up?

1694
01:27:06,615 --> 01:27:09,187
Listen, I got a subpoena.
- Subpoena?

1695
01:27:09,387 --> 01:27:10,387
What the fuck are you talking about?

1696
01:27:10,587 --> 01:27:12,723
The FBI wants a copy
of your wedding video.

1697
01:27:12,923 --> 01:27:15,288
The F-B-fucking-I?
You fucking kidding me?

1698
01:27:15,487 --> 01:27:17,023
Listen to me,
His Name’s Denham,

1699
01:27:17,473 --> 01:27:18,893
he’s an agent in the New York office.

1700
01:27:19,213 --> 01:27:21,314
What’s his problem?
- He’s a boy scout,

1701
01:27:21,514 --> 01:27:23,823
..thinks you’re Gordon Gekko.

1702
01:27:24,023 --> 01:27:25,857
What does he want with my wedding video?

1703
01:27:26,057 --> 01:27:28,294
It's like invasion of my privacy,
You know what i'm saying.

1704
01:27:28,494 --> 01:27:30,256
It's intrusive..you know.

1705
01:27:30,456 --> 01:27:32,886
He's got your pictures of your
whole inner fucking circle.

1706
01:27:33,086 --> 01:27:34,086
Pictures, names of the people..

1707
01:27:34,286 --> 01:27:37,393
You know what he's trying to do.
Exactly, what's he's doing now. Look at yourself.

1708
01:27:37,593 --> 01:27:38,593
He's trying to rattle you.

1709
01:27:38,793 --> 01:27:42,677
He's trying to rattle your old lady.
So, she'll nags you to be a fuckin' witness.

1710
01:27:42,877 --> 01:27:44,420
Oh, He wants me to rat on myself?

1711
01:27:44,620 --> 01:27:46,872
He wants me to give information
about my..what?

1712
01:27:47,072 --> 01:27:49,594
The good fucking news is,
you know I know everybody downtown,

1713
01:27:49,794 --> 01:27:52,202
I called The Justice Department,
The DEA..

1714
01:27:52,402 --> 01:27:55,716
nobody even know you
fucking exists, so calm down.

1715
01:27:55,916 --> 01:27:57,930
They don't know I exist?
- No.

1716
01:27:58,130 --> 01:27:59,130
That's good.

1717
01:28:04,953 --> 01:28:07,913
You know who he is right?
- Yeah.

1718
01:28:08,113 --> 01:28:11,710
So, if I just wanted to get some more
information, just find out what he knows,

1719
01:28:13,667 --> 01:28:15,859
we could go to his house right?
Tap his phones a little bit,

1720
01:28:16,059 --> 01:28:20,447
..bug in get a little information..
- You don't fuck with these guys like that,

1721
01:28:20,647 --> 01:28:22,780
you don't fuck with him like that.
What are you nuts or something?

1722
01:28:22,980 --> 01:28:24,742
That's what you fucking do.
What do I pay you for?

1723
01:28:24,942 --> 01:28:26,854
I have a fucking P.I license you know.

1724
01:28:27,054 --> 01:28:29,016
I make a living at this,
I'm not a cop anymore.

1725
01:28:29,216 --> 01:28:30,975
They'll take my fucking license
away from me, alright?

1726
01:28:31,175 --> 01:28:32,175
Okay.

1727
01:28:32,375 --> 01:28:34,385
Okay, if I can't do that,

1728
01:28:34,585 --> 01:28:36,844
Can i just..can I give the guy a call?

1729
01:28:38,334 --> 01:28:41,022
Why is that..Jordan.
Jordan do me a favor.

1730
01:28:41,222 --> 01:28:44,114
The only one who calls
this guy is your fucking lawyer.

1731
01:28:45,465 --> 01:28:48,687
I told you, whatever
the fuck you say to him,

1732
01:28:48,887 --> 01:28:51,425
He's gonna used it against you.
Don't you understand?

1733
01:28:51,625 --> 01:28:54,272
He is smart, you are dumb.
- Fucking bullshit.

1734
01:28:54,472 --> 01:28:56,517
I'm not allowed to call him.
- Are we fucking talking tonight?

1735
01:28:57,506 --> 01:28:59,358
The last time you took these
fucking pills, you put..

1736
01:28:59,558 --> 01:29:01,985
your head in fucking micooven,
I'm not making it up

1737
01:29:03,346 --> 01:29:04,836
Okay, I won't call.

1738
01:29:08,890 --> 01:29:10,369
Hey, fellas! C’mon aboard!

1739
01:29:10,569 --> 01:29:11,569
Plank’s right down there.

1740
01:29:13,663 --> 01:29:15,211
Welcome.

1741
01:29:15,411 --> 01:29:16,411
What a nice day.

1742
01:29:20,044 --> 01:29:20,944
Welcome aboard.

1743
01:29:22,749 --> 01:29:24,990
Jordan, Welcome aboard to Naomi.
Pleasure to meet you.

1744
01:29:25,190 --> 01:29:26,948
I’m Agent Denham.
This is Agent Hughes.

1745
01:29:27,148 --> 01:29:28,822
Hi, how are you?
Let me introduce you.

1746
01:29:29,022 --> 01:29:30,945
This is Nicole.
Heidi, come on. Don't be shy.

1747
01:29:31,145 --> 01:29:33,777
What are you guys all shy for?
Don't be scared.

1748
01:29:33,977 --> 01:29:36,190
These are friends of Stratten.
- It's a Pleasure. - Hello.

1749
01:29:39,642 --> 01:29:42,418
Your message said that,
you wanted to speak privately.

1750
01:29:42,618 --> 01:29:44,516
Right. I do want to
speak privately.

1751
01:29:44,716 --> 01:29:45,716
Give us a minute, huh, Ladies.

1752
01:29:45,916 --> 01:29:48,637
Let me know if I can get you anything.
We'd be happy to help.

1753
01:29:49,643 --> 01:29:50,722
You guys hungry?

1754
01:29:50,922 --> 01:29:53,712
If you want something to eat.
We got some pasta, shrimp, lobster,

1755
01:29:53,912 --> 01:29:55,847
I got whiskey,
anykind of booze you want?

1756
01:29:56,047 --> 01:29:59,055
You know what, the bureau doesn't
allow us to drink when we are at sea.

1757
01:29:59,255 --> 01:30:01,544
Duh? Of course.

1758
01:30:01,744 --> 01:30:02,744
Ever been on one of these before?

1759
01:30:02,944 --> 01:30:04,819
A boat?

1760
01:30:05,973 --> 01:30:07,309
I learned to sail when I was six.

1761
01:30:07,509 --> 01:30:08,509
No, shit.
Is that right.

1762
01:30:09,671 --> 01:30:10,846
I mean, one like this, though.

1763
01:30:11,046 --> 01:30:13,962
I had the whole front extended
to put a chopper up there.

1764
01:30:14,162 --> 01:30:15,162
See that?

1765
01:30:17,128 --> 01:30:18,381
Anyway, this is for you.

1766
01:30:18,581 --> 01:30:21,360
It's a complete list of every person
that was at my wedding.

1767
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:23,915
I understand you wanted
the whole wedding video,

1768
01:30:24,115 --> 01:30:26,406
I figured this would help expedite
the whole process, right?

1769
01:30:26,606 --> 01:30:27,606
There you go.

1770
01:30:27,806 --> 01:30:29,907
Look.
My point is that.

1771
01:30:30,107 --> 01:30:31,762
I know you’re investigating Stratton,

1772
01:30:31,962 --> 01:30:35,162
but, for the life of me
I can’t figure out why.

1773
01:30:35,362 --> 01:30:37,600
I know we are a little unorthodox;
We're a little...

1774
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:39,078
loud in the way we do things.

1775
01:30:39,278 --> 01:30:42,835
You gotta understand,
trying to make a name for ourselves.

1776
01:30:43,035 --> 01:30:48,405
But, I want you to understand,
we don't do anything illegal.

1777
01:30:48,605 --> 01:30:50,370
Whatsoever.

1778
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:52,815
You could talk to the SEC,
They're at my office,

1779
01:30:53,015 --> 01:30:55,306
fifteen times,
over the last six month, so..

1780
01:30:55,506 --> 01:30:57,504
I got nothing to hide.

1781
01:30:57,704 --> 01:31:00,607
You know, The SEC’s a
civil regulatory agency.

1782
01:31:00,807 --> 01:31:01,807
We pursue criminal activity.

1783
01:31:02,007 --> 01:31:03,006
Exactly.

1784
01:31:03,526 --> 01:31:04,526
You go after real criminal. Which...

1785
01:31:05,950 --> 01:31:08,926
makes me wonder, what the hell
you're investigating me for?

1786
01:31:09,126 --> 01:31:10,126
I mean, honestly. What..

1787
01:31:10,206 --> 01:31:14,133
What is it that you think,
that we did or do. I don't get it.

1788
01:31:14,333 --> 01:31:15,334
Well,

1789
01:31:15,534 --> 01:31:18,201
Jordan, I can’t discuss
ongoing investigations.

1790
01:31:18,401 --> 01:31:19,401
No, i get that.
I understand.

1791
01:31:19,601 --> 01:31:20,601
With that said.

1792
01:31:22,047 --> 01:31:23,940
This case got dumped
on my desk.

1793
01:31:24,140 --> 01:31:25,140
You know, by a higher up..

1794
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:28,488
Who needs to make a show of
looking into the new company,

1795
01:31:28,688 --> 01:31:30,965
on the block. The whole press
and everything.

1796
01:31:31,165 --> 01:31:33,564
I end up being the smuck
who does the looking.

1797
01:31:33,764 --> 01:31:34,764
Exactly.

1798
01:31:34,964 --> 01:31:35,964
It's just..you know,
it bothers me.

1799
01:31:36,624 --> 01:31:37,794
We are the new guy.

1800
01:31:37,994 --> 01:31:39,683
we're the one that's banging
on Wall Streets door, man.

1801
01:31:39,883 --> 01:31:42,323
You should see what's going on
at the bigger firm.

1802
01:31:42,523 --> 01:31:43,523
I know all the information.

1803
01:31:43,624 --> 01:31:44,673
It's true.

1804
01:31:44,873 --> 01:31:46,939
Goldman, Leyman Brothers, Merrill.

1805
01:31:47,139 --> 01:31:50,286
collateralized debt obligations?
This internet stock bullshit?

1806
01:31:50,486 --> 01:31:51,486
I mean, it's a fucking travesty.

1807
01:31:51,686 --> 01:31:54,518
I mean,
I could take you step-by-step,

1808
01:31:54,718 --> 01:31:58,477
to what exactly is occuring.
You know, all you have to do is ask.

1809
01:31:58,677 --> 01:31:59,677
I'm available.

1810
01:32:00,668 --> 01:32:02,019
That's exactly
what I wanted to hear.

1811
01:32:02,219 --> 01:32:04,666
I don't see why,
a little sit down like this.

1812
01:32:05,868 --> 01:32:07,405
Can't be profitable
for the both of us.

1813
01:32:07,605 --> 01:32:09,966
It should, right?
It should be profitable for us.

1814
01:32:10,166 --> 01:32:11,166
It should.
- Look?

1815
01:32:11,366 --> 01:32:13,507
I'm gonna give you my personal line,

1816
01:32:13,707 --> 01:32:16,604
five days a week you just call me.
Feel free.

1817
01:32:16,804 --> 01:32:18,967
I'll do that.
- Great.

1818
01:32:21,953 --> 01:32:23,159
Are you sure you guys don't want
something to drink?

1819
01:32:23,359 --> 01:32:25,046
I mean, you're not hungry.
Nothing?

1820
01:32:25,246 --> 01:32:27,108
Oh, no.
- No?

1821
01:32:30,147 --> 01:32:31,074
Let me ask you.

1822
01:32:31,274 --> 01:32:34,159
And if you don't wanna get too personal,
just tell me to shut up at anytime.

1823
01:32:35,553 --> 01:32:38,000
Did you try to get your broker's
license at one time?

1824
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:39,200
Did I hear that right?

1825
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:41,339
Were you trying to
take a stab at Wall Street?

1826
01:32:42,587 --> 01:32:43,897
Who've you been talking to?

1827
01:32:44,097 --> 01:32:46,285
Who the fuck have you been talking to?
- Well, you're investigating me..

1828
01:32:46,485 --> 01:32:48,876
I hear things.
You see what I mean?

1829
01:32:50,089 --> 01:32:51,899
You ever think about,
what would've happened.

1830
01:32:52,099 --> 01:32:54,086
if you've..you know,
stayed the course?

1831
01:32:55,635 --> 01:32:57,601
You know what. When
I’m riding home on the subway,

1832
01:32:57,801 --> 01:33:01,039
And, my balls are fucking sweating.
I'm wearing the same suit, three days in row.

1833
01:33:01,239 --> 01:33:02,239
Yeah, you bet I do.

1834
01:33:02,439 --> 01:33:04,152
I thought about it, before.
Who wouldn't, right?

1835
01:33:04,352 --> 01:33:05,352
Right, who fucking wouldn't.

1836
01:33:05,552 --> 01:33:07,474
I mean, you got..
another personal question.

1837
01:33:07,674 --> 01:33:09,486
You don't need to answe..
- No, it's alright Jordan.

1838
01:33:09,686 --> 01:33:12,528
What are you pulling?
50-60K something like that, a year?

1839
01:33:16,602 --> 01:33:17,562
Let's put it this way.

1840
01:33:17,762 --> 01:33:20,431
You get a free handgun,
when you sign up for the bureau.

1841
01:33:21,496 --> 01:33:22,686
No. But, it fucking pisses me off.

1842
01:33:22,886 --> 01:33:23,886
You know what I mean.
You think about,

1843
01:33:24,086 --> 01:33:27,529
the people that build this country,
hardworking people like you.

1844
01:33:27,729 --> 01:33:30,069
You know,firefighters,
teachers, FBI agents.

1845
01:33:30,269 --> 01:33:33,895
End of the day, you guys get
fucking skinned to life, financially.

1846
01:33:34,095 --> 01:33:35,095
Fucking makes me angry.

1847
01:33:36,354 --> 01:33:38,705
That's the one thing about
Wall Street and this market is.

1848
01:33:38,905 --> 01:33:44,015
For me, I feel, it's good to give back.
You know, there's

1849
01:33:44,215 --> 01:33:46,304
there's situations.. where I can.

1850
01:33:46,504 --> 01:33:49,370
make those situations
better for people.

1851
01:33:49,570 --> 01:33:50,570
You know.

1852
01:33:51,958 --> 01:33:54,277
Opportunity, is everything.

1853
01:33:54,477 --> 01:33:55,477
Exactly.

1854
01:33:55,677 --> 01:33:58,076
Yeah, for example.
I got this one kid, right.

1855
01:33:59,554 --> 01:34:02,271
Went to school for environmental
science or something like that.

1856
01:34:02,471 --> 01:34:04,271
He was bogged down by
student's loans.

1857
01:34:04,471 --> 01:34:06,949
Turns out, his mother needed
triple bypass surgery.

1858
01:34:07,149 --> 01:34:08,148
Horrible situation.

1859
01:34:08,348 --> 01:34:11,352
But, we got him in at the market
at the right time.

1860
01:34:11,552 --> 01:34:12,552
Choose the right stock.

1861
01:34:12,572 --> 01:34:13,612
We gave him the right guidance.

1862
01:34:13,812 --> 01:34:17,076
Boom. Overnight,
changes his entire life.

1863
01:34:17,276 --> 01:34:20,772
You know, he got to put his mother in the
best hospital in New York city.

1864
01:34:20,972 --> 01:34:24,199
It didn't work out for her, granted
she passed away, unfortunately.

1865
01:34:24,399 --> 01:34:27,140
But, we gave him that opportunity,
you know what i'm saying.

1866
01:34:27,340 --> 01:34:30,089
It's just about setting up
the right team and then,

1867
01:34:30,289 --> 01:34:32,833
overnight, your life can change.

1868
01:34:38,209 --> 01:34:39,947
What is..intern..uh..

1869
01:34:41,989 --> 01:34:44,205
What does an intern make off
on a deal like that?

1870
01:34:44,405 --> 01:34:45,405
On that situation..

1871
01:34:45,605 --> 01:34:49,146
On that particular trade.
One trade.

1872
01:34:49,345 --> 01:34:52,427
North of half a million dollars.

1873
01:34:56,598 --> 01:34:58,372
And, I'd do that for anybody.

1874
01:34:58,572 --> 01:35:01,908
You know, anybody that needs
the proper guidence.

1875
01:35:21,407 --> 01:35:23,479
Can you say that again?

1876
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:25,355
Just the way, you said it.

1877
01:35:25,555 --> 01:35:26,555
Just the same way.

1878
01:35:31,888 --> 01:35:32,751
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1879
01:35:32,951 --> 01:35:34,541
No..come on you know
what i'm talking about.

1880
01:35:34,741 --> 01:35:36,580
Just say the same thing.
I think, what Jordan just did is he..

1881
01:35:36,780 --> 01:35:37,780
If I'm not mistaken.

1882
01:35:37,980 --> 01:35:40,540
You just tried to bribe
a Federal Officer.

1883
01:35:40,740 --> 01:35:42,796
No, technically,
I didn't bribe anybody.

1884
01:35:44,502 --> 01:35:46,660
According to the US Criminal Code,

1885
01:35:46,860 --> 01:35:50,032
there needs to be exact dollar figure
for the exchange of services.

1886
01:35:50,506 --> 01:35:52,209
That would not hold up
in the court of law.

1887
01:35:54,969 --> 01:35:55,819
That's the truth, But..

1888
01:35:56,019 --> 01:35:57,514
I wanna tell you this,
- Yeah.

1889
01:35:57,714 --> 01:36:01,022
The same gentleman, that told me
you tried to get your broker's license,

1890
01:36:01,222 --> 01:36:03,004
also told me that
you are a straight arrow.

1891
01:36:03,204 --> 01:36:04,204
He ran a security check on me.

1892
01:36:04,404 --> 01:36:05,404
Well..

1893
01:36:07,408 --> 01:36:10,939
i'm on a boat fit for a bond villain
sometimes you need to play the part, right?

1894
01:36:12,463 --> 01:36:15,568
I think it's time you both
get the fuck off my boat. What do you say?

1895
01:36:17,385 --> 01:36:18,522
You know, Jordan.
I'll tell you something.

1896
01:36:18,722 --> 01:36:21,110
Most of the Wall Street
jackasses I bust,

1897
01:36:23,324 --> 01:36:24,403
they were born to the life.
- Is that right?

1898
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:27,149
Their father was a douchebags.

1899
01:36:27,349 --> 01:36:29,294
Just like their fathers before them.

1900
01:36:29,494 --> 01:36:30,494
But you,

1901
01:36:32,710 --> 01:36:35,756
You Jordan, you got this way
all on your own.

1902
01:36:35,956 --> 01:36:36,956
Did I?

1903
01:36:37,156 --> 01:36:38,156
Good for you, little man.

1904
01:36:38,356 --> 01:36:39,356
Little man?

1905
01:36:39,556 --> 01:36:41,737
Good for you.
- Me, the littleman?

1906
01:36:41,937 --> 01:36:42,936
Let me tell you something.

1907
01:36:43,136 --> 01:36:44,916
Let me tell you something else.

1908
01:36:45,116 --> 01:36:47,210
Honestly, i'm not bullshitting here,

1909
01:36:47,410 --> 01:36:49,225
this is one of the nicest boat
that i've ever been on.

1910
01:36:49,425 --> 01:36:50,833
I gotta..I gotta tell you.
- I bet it is.

1911
01:36:51,033 --> 01:36:52,033
And, you know what
I was just thinking too.

1912
01:36:52,233 --> 01:36:54,821
The fucking hero that
I'm gonna be back at the office.

1913
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:57,924
When the bureau seizes
this fucking boat.

1914
01:36:58,124 --> 01:37:00,143
B'cos, I'm gonna finally fuck Jordan.

1915
01:37:01,977 --> 01:37:02,999
It's beautiful.

1916
01:37:03,199 --> 01:37:04,198
And, you get the beautiful girls and everything.

1917
01:37:04,469 --> 01:37:05,716
It's wonderful.

1918
01:37:05,916 --> 01:37:08,053
Alright, get the fuck off my boat.

1919
01:37:08,253 --> 01:37:10,871
I'm sure we'll be seeing each other, real soon.
- I'm sure.

1920
01:37:11,071 --> 01:37:14,547
Good luck on that subway ride home
to your miserable ugly fucking wives.

1921
01:37:14,747 --> 01:37:17,867
I'm gonna have Heidi lick some caviar
off my balls.In the meantime.

1922
01:37:18,067 --> 01:37:20,721
Hey, you guys wanna take
some lobsters for your ride home?

1923
01:37:21,114 --> 01:37:22,869
You fucking miserable pricks!
I know you can't afford them.

1924
01:37:23,069 --> 01:37:25,053
Fucking cheap fucks.

1925
01:37:25,253 --> 01:37:26,253
Fucking miserable pricks!

1926
01:37:28,128 --> 01:37:30,627
Hey, fellas..look what I found
in my pockets. Look!

1927
01:37:30,628 --> 01:37:32,941
Your year salary, right here.

1928
01:37:33,141 --> 01:37:34,141
You know what I call them?

1929
01:37:34,341 --> 01:37:35,340
Fun coupons.

1930
01:37:36,952 --> 01:37:39,780
A fun coupons.

1931
01:37:47,549 --> 01:37:50,173
Switzerland?
What the fuck is in Switzerland?

1932
01:37:50,386 --> 01:37:51,706
Swiss fucking Banks, that's what.

1933
01:37:52,616 --> 01:37:55,165
It was ass covering time.
I had to hide my money.

1934
01:37:56,095 --> 01:37:57,325
Enter Rugrat.

1935
01:37:57,975 --> 01:38:00,145
He knew Swiss Banker from law school.

1936
01:38:00,345 --> 01:38:01,345
But, he was in Geneva.

1937
01:38:01,545 --> 01:38:04,670
And there was no way,
I'm gonna make that flight sober.

1938
01:38:06,425 --> 01:38:09,882
So, I knew if I took my drugs right.
I could sleep through the entire flight.

1939
01:38:10,465 --> 01:38:12,285
But, I had to take em, JUST RIGHT.

1940
01:38:13,035 --> 01:38:15,534
At 4 pm I popped a few more ludes.

1941
01:38:15,535 --> 01:38:18,536
Which started kicking in by the time
I finished my sales meeting.

1942
01:38:18,736 --> 01:38:19,736
My tingle phase.

1943
01:38:20,674 --> 01:38:22,273
By dinner I popped a few more

1944
01:38:22,473 --> 01:38:24,933
on top of some cocktails and a
valium or two.

1945
01:38:25,133 --> 01:38:27,190
My slur phase.

1946
01:38:29,441 --> 01:38:31,446
By eight thirty,
I popped a few more ludes.

1947
01:38:31,646 --> 01:38:33,623
and pretty much lost my motor skills.

1948
01:38:33,823 --> 01:38:36,328
This was the drool phase.

1949
01:38:39,494 --> 01:38:41,782
By ten I didn’t know who
or what the fuck I was--

1950
01:38:41,982 --> 01:38:43,592
The amnesia phase.

1951
01:38:44,742 --> 01:38:46,552
We boarded the plane,
just before midnight.

1952
01:38:46,921 --> 01:38:50,145
Wow! Look at you.
You're all beautiful.

1953
01:38:53,572 --> 01:38:55,702
May I see your boarding passes Sir.
- We have boarding passes.

1954
01:39:05,182 --> 01:39:06,830
He's got his hand on my dick again.

1955
01:39:10,270 --> 01:39:11,420
Oh, my God! Take it off.

1956
01:39:13,069 --> 01:39:13,836
Take it off.

1957
01:39:14,101 --> 01:39:16,085
I heard there's a treasure map,
under here.

1958
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:17,649
Stop.

1959
01:39:19,569 --> 01:39:20,559
Please, sit down.

1960
01:39:20,759 --> 01:39:22,568
Go back to your seat, please.

1961
01:39:22,768 --> 01:39:24,502
Please, go back to your seat.

1962
01:39:24,702 --> 01:39:26,588
I will have to call the captain.

1963
01:39:26,788 --> 01:39:28,822
Please, Sir.
Please sit down.

1964
01:39:29,022 --> 01:39:30,022
Please sit down!

1965
01:39:30,222 --> 01:39:31,222
Okay, i'm going.

1966
01:39:32,763 --> 01:39:33,953
Okay..okay.

1967
01:39:36,037 --> 01:39:37,445
Fasten your seatbelt please.

1968
01:39:37,645 --> 01:39:40,254
We cannot take off, if you haven't
fasten your seatbelt.

1969
01:39:40,454 --> 01:39:41,454
Sit down, fasten it.

1970
01:39:41,654 --> 01:39:43,669
I will do it for you.
- What?

1971
01:39:43,869 --> 01:39:44,869
I will do it for you.

1972
01:39:45,069 --> 01:39:47,634
You gotta speak english
We don't understand Swiss language.

1973
01:40:14,833 --> 01:40:15,881
Christ. Fuck.

1974
01:40:18,691 --> 01:40:19,643
Donnie.

1975
01:40:19,843 --> 01:40:22,902
Donnie, this isn't funny,
untie me, buddy.

1976
01:40:23,102 --> 01:40:24,879
I can’t tie you.

1977
01:40:25,079 --> 01:40:26,771
The captain tied you.

1978
01:40:26,971 --> 01:40:27,971
He was fucking tasing you.

1979
01:40:29,624 --> 01:40:30,727
Why?

1980
01:40:30,927 --> 01:40:31,927
Why?

1981
01:40:46,162 --> 01:40:47,357
You're screaming at people.

1982
01:40:47,557 --> 01:40:48,557
Fuck off.

1983
01:40:48,757 --> 01:40:51,413
You were on the floor,
like rolling around and shit.

1984
01:40:51,613 --> 01:40:53,558
You called the captain the N-words.

1985
01:40:53,758 --> 01:40:56,089
I call the captain an N-words?

1986
01:40:56,289 --> 01:40:57,289
Yeah, he was very upset.

1987
01:40:57,489 --> 01:40:58,489
Really?

1988
01:40:58,689 --> 01:40:59,689
Luckily, we are in first class.

1989
01:41:01,996 --> 01:41:04,506
Jesus Christ, I think you have
a fucking drug problem.

1990
01:41:05,930 --> 01:41:07,122
Where are the ludes?

1991
01:41:07,322 --> 01:41:08,918
Where are the ludes?

1992
01:41:09,118 --> 01:41:11,252
They're in my ass,
don't worry about it.

1993
01:41:11,452 --> 01:41:12,452
I got it.

1994
01:41:12,652 --> 01:41:13,652
Thank god.

1995
01:41:14,968 --> 01:41:17,423
Jesus Christ, what are we gonna do when
we get to Switzerland, buddy.

1996
01:41:17,623 --> 01:41:18,623
This is bad.

1997
01:41:18,823 --> 01:41:20,610
This fucking thing's pressing my chest
I can't breath.

1998
01:41:20,810 --> 01:41:21,809
Do something to calm
me down, please.

1999
01:41:22,009 --> 01:41:24,135
Okay, shut the fuck up.
Just shut the fuck up.

2000
01:41:24,335 --> 01:41:25,335
Help me.

2001
01:41:25,535 --> 01:41:26,535
Okay...shhh..shh..

2002
01:41:27,907 --> 01:41:29,618
That's good.
-  Go to sleep.

2003
01:41:29,818 --> 01:41:30,818
Rub it harder, buddy.

2004
01:41:31,018 --> 01:41:32,017
You're all right.

2005
01:41:32,217 --> 01:41:34,695
We all love you.
Shut the fuck up!

2006
01:41:40,702 --> 01:41:41,926
Mr.Belfort.

2007
01:41:42,125 --> 01:41:43,125
You're free to go.

2008
01:41:45,824 --> 01:41:47,111
Really?

2009
01:41:50,923 --> 01:41:51,713
Hey, Donnie.
- Yeah.

2010
01:41:51,913 --> 01:41:53,514
When we get up there.
Try not to act like yourself, okay?

2011
01:41:53,714 --> 01:41:55,487
Let's make Geneva an
asshole free Donnie zone, alright?

2012
01:41:55,687 --> 01:41:56,687
Why the fuck are you
coming at me for?

2013
01:41:56,918 --> 01:41:59,016
Hey, listen..the only reason
you're sitting in this limo

2014
01:41:59,216 --> 01:42:00,970
and not a Swiss jail is
b'cos of my friend, okay?

2015
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:04,378
We are here.
We are here.

2016
01:42:05,457 --> 01:42:06,627
Jordan Belfort!

2017
01:42:06,827 --> 01:42:07,827
At last!

2018
01:42:08,027 --> 01:42:10,533
Nicholas has told me so much.

2019
01:42:11,619 --> 01:42:13,138
Jordan, Jean-Jacques Saurel.

2020
01:42:13,338 --> 01:42:15,482
Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
- Nice to meet you.

2021
01:42:23,585 --> 01:42:26,412
I'm curious about your bank
secrecy laws, here.

2022
01:42:30,587 --> 01:42:31,491
Excusez-moi, Jordan,

2023
01:42:31,775 --> 01:42:36,184
Swiss custom requires
ten minutes of blah blah blah..

2024
01:42:36,385 --> 01:42:37,385
Chit chat.
Chit chat! Thank you.

2025
01:42:37,585 --> 01:42:39,683
before business can be discussed.

2026
01:42:45,231 --> 01:42:47,840
Of course, let’s get “down to it.”

2027
01:42:48,040 --> 01:42:49,040
What would you like to know?

2028
01:42:50,438 --> 01:42:52,393
Under what circumstances
would you be..

2029
01:42:52,593 --> 01:42:54,866
..obligated to cooperate with an FBI

2030
01:42:55,066 --> 01:42:58,881
or U.S. Justice Department investigation?
For example.

2031
01:42:59,081 --> 01:43:00,081
<i>Ca depend.</i>

2032
01:43:01,457 --> 01:43:03,468
<i>Ca depend?
- Oui.</i>

2033
01:43:04,716 --> 01:43:06,860
<i>  Ca depend </i>on what?
Exactly.

2034
01:43:08,048 --> 01:43:10,946
Whether America plans to invade
Switzerland in the coming months.

2035
01:43:12,516 --> 01:43:14,292
So, check if tanks are rolling down
the Rue de la Croix?

2036
01:43:14,492 --> 01:43:15,591
Yes, <i>Rue de la Croix</i>.

2037
01:43:31,419 --> 01:43:36,002
<i>What I’m asking, you Swiss dick,
is are you going to fuck me over.</i>

2038
01:43:39,016 --> 01:43:42,720
<i>I understand perfectly,
you American shitheel.</i>

2039
01:43:44,870 --> 01:43:47,789
The only way the Banque
Real de Geneve would cooperate;

2040
01:43:47,989 --> 01:43:48,989
with a foreign legal body

2041
01:43:49,189 --> 01:43:53,228
is if the crime being pursued is
also a crime in Switzerland.

2042
01:43:53,499 --> 01:43:57,940
But, there are very few Swiss laws
which apply to your practices.

2043
01:43:58,140 --> 01:44:00,680
From a financial standpoint,

2044
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:03,742
you are now in heaven.

2045
01:44:03,942 --> 01:44:06,005
See, I told you he's fantastic, right?

2046
01:44:06,427 --> 01:44:09,655
If the U.S. Justice Department
sent us a subpoena,

2047
01:44:10,158 --> 01:44:12,705
it would become<i> papier-toillette</i>.

2048
01:44:14,549 --> 01:44:16,381
We would wipe our ass with it.

2049
01:44:16,581 --> 01:44:17,580
Unless, of course..

2050
01:44:17,780 --> 01:44:21,020
it was an investigation
into stock fraud..

2051
01:44:21,220 --> 01:44:24,149
which is a crime in Switzerland.
If I'm correct.

2052
01:44:24,349 --> 01:44:27,503
Then, there’d have to be Cooperacion.

2053
01:44:27,703 --> 01:44:28,703
On your part,
If I'm not mistaken.

2054
01:44:30,356 --> 01:44:31,216
Yes, we would.

2055
01:44:32,536 --> 01:44:35,311
Assuming the account is
under your name.

2056
01:44:37,023 --> 01:44:38,189
if it were..

2057
01:44:38,389 --> 01:44:39,389
another name..

2058
01:44:41,041 --> 01:44:43,505
A friends, Comerate, Cousin..

2059
01:44:48,766 --> 01:44:50,197
Relatives?
Yeah.

2060
01:44:52,741 --> 01:44:54,886
Was that yodeling I just heard or

2061
01:44:55,086 --> 01:44:57,100
did you just say
what I thought you said?

2062
01:44:57,300 --> 01:44:59,583
Yes!  Yes!

2063
01:44:59,783 --> 01:45:02,606
He's telling me to use a rathole.

2064
01:45:02,806 --> 01:45:06,548
But, a U.S. rathole would never
get into Switzerland with all that money.

2065
01:45:06,748 --> 01:45:10,921
What I needed was a ratholr
with a European passport.

2066
01:45:18,337 --> 01:45:19,611
Jordan?

2067
01:45:19,811 --> 01:45:22,687
Hey! How is my favourite Aunt, huh?

2068
01:45:22,887 --> 01:45:25,371
Welcome, was the traffic terrible?
- No, not at all.

2069
01:45:29,981 --> 01:45:32,311
Thank God, Aunt Emma didn't need
too much convincing.

2070
01:45:33,171 --> 01:45:35,101
Turned out, the british weren't too much
different from the Swiss.

2071
01:45:35,301 --> 01:45:38,354
Money talks.
And, bullshit takes the bus.

2072
01:45:38,554 --> 01:45:40,718
How do you say 'rathole' in British.

2073
01:45:40,918 --> 01:45:43,138
If you get in any trouble, whatsoever.

2074
01:45:43,338 --> 01:45:46,106
I'll come forward immediately.
I'll say that I duped you.

2075
01:45:46,306 --> 01:45:47,306
That I promise.

2076
01:45:48,735 --> 01:45:51,275
Risk is what keeps us young,
isn’t it darling?

2077
01:45:55,607 --> 01:45:57,161
Sometimes, I wonder

2078
01:45:57,361 --> 01:45:59,983
if you let money get
the best of you, my love.

2079
01:46:00,183 --> 01:46:03,693
Among other substances.

2080
01:46:08,015 --> 01:46:09,972
It’s that obvious, huh?

2081
01:46:10,172 --> 01:46:12,539
It's chilly darling and you're
sweating bullets.

2082
01:46:15,798 --> 01:46:19,301
What can I say, Aunt Emma.
I’m a drug addict.

2083
01:46:20,497 --> 01:46:21,920
I really am. I mean,

2084
01:46:22,120 --> 01:46:23,120
Cocaine, pills..

2085
01:46:24,861 --> 01:46:26,856
Whatever it is,
I'll fucking do it.

2086
01:46:27,056 --> 01:46:29,160
That's the truth.

2087
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:32,141
I am a sex addict too.

2088
01:46:32,341 --> 01:46:35,649
Well, there are worse things
to be addicted to than sex.

2089
01:46:36,979 --> 01:46:38,699
Jesus, why am I telling you all this?

2090
01:46:38,899 --> 01:46:39,899
I am sorry.

2091
01:46:41,930 --> 01:46:43,824
Because I'm very easy to talk to.

2092
01:46:44,024 --> 01:46:45,024
You are.

2093
01:46:45,224 --> 01:46:47,155
You are easy to talk to.

2094
01:46:47,355 --> 01:46:48,355
I suppose it's..

2095
01:46:50,411 --> 01:46:51,979
It's just my job, you know, it's uh...

2096
01:46:52,179 --> 01:46:56,352
All these people depending on me, tens of
millions of dollars at stake, you know,

2097
01:46:56,552 --> 01:46:58,317
Sometimes, I feel like I..

2098
01:46:58,517 --> 01:47:01,545
I've bitten on more than
I can chew, you know?

2099
01:47:01,745 --> 01:47:04,288
You're a man with large appetites.

2100
01:47:04,488 --> 01:47:05,488
Yeah.

2101
01:47:07,998 --> 01:47:09,895
Is she, fucking hitting on me?

2102
01:47:10,095 --> 01:47:11,095
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

2103
01:47:14,881 --> 01:47:17,801
I suppose, I put that on
myself though, right?

2104
01:47:18,001 --> 01:47:19,001
My decision.

2105
01:47:19,201 --> 01:47:21,460
It's hard to..

2106
01:47:21,660 --> 01:47:22,659
Hard to learn to..

2107
01:47:22,859 --> 01:47:25,931
to control the anxiety
sometimes, you know?

2108
01:47:28,089 --> 01:47:30,767
Learn to relax, and let go.

2109
01:47:32,125 --> 01:47:33,933
To release the tension.

2110
01:47:35,260 --> 01:47:36,967
She is hitting on me.

2111
01:47:37,167 --> 01:47:38,167
Holy shit!

2112
01:47:38,367 --> 01:47:40,693
Yeah, release the tension.

2113
01:47:45,431 --> 01:47:49,773
Suppose we, uh.. We
all just need to learn not..

2114
01:47:49,973 --> 01:47:52,876
Learn to do what comes
naturally in life, you know?

2115
01:47:55,934 --> 01:47:58,030
Is he fucking hitting on me?

2116
01:48:04,609 --> 01:48:05,937
Stability, dear.

2117
01:48:06,137 --> 01:48:07,137
Family.

2118
01:48:14,414 --> 01:48:15,894
You take care of my nice, my love.

2119
01:48:16,094 --> 01:48:18,283
I'll take care of everything, over here.

2120
01:48:19,980 --> 01:48:21,420
Deal.

2121
01:48:27,268 --> 01:48:30,943
We had, literally,
a fuck load of money.

2122
01:48:31,143 --> 01:48:33,989
Aunt Emma, could never carry
all this by herself.

2123
01:48:34,328 --> 01:48:38,147
So, I thought to myself,
who else has European passport?

2124
01:48:39,798 --> 01:48:43,143
Now, Brad, as a successful
drug dealer,

2125
01:48:43,690 --> 01:48:45,782
spent his winters in the south of France,

2126
01:48:45,824 --> 01:48:47,815
which is where he met his wife, Chantelle.

2127
01:48:47,826 --> 01:48:50,795
A striper of Slovenian origin,

2128
01:48:50,829 --> 01:48:54,663
born in, of all places, Switzerland.

2129
01:48:58,769 --> 01:49:00,760
Well, this is fucked.

2130
01:49:00,771 --> 01:49:02,739
Oh, no, shit!

2131
01:49:05,942 --> 01:49:09,878
- Like this will take a, like, 50 trips.
- I know.

2132
01:49:13,750 --> 01:49:14,808
Yeah, a suicide work.

2133
01:49:14,884 --> 01:49:17,750
But, how about her family? Right?

2134
01:49:17,786 --> 01:49:19,913
I mean, they all got
Swiss's passport, right?

2135
01:49:19,922 --> 01:49:21,856
I mean, she's got parents,
she's got a brother.

2136
01:49:21,890 --> 01:49:24,654
Right, brother's got a wife,
that's five fuckin' people.

2137
01:49:24,693 --> 01:49:26,661
Six, seven trips, boom, right?

2138
01:49:26,695 --> 01:49:28,890
They're all fuckin' Swiss and it was like,
''what are you doing?'', they could do that.

2139
01:49:28,931 --> 01:49:31,764
At least I have a family,
you crooked nose fuck!

2140
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:34,860
Hey, hey, uh, don't
forget about my money.

2141
01:49:36,704 --> 01:49:38,729
- I'm sorry, what was that?
- Hey, I forgot to tell you

2142
01:49:38,740 --> 01:49:41,732
- he's got some, he's got some money.
- My money.

2143
01:49:41,776 --> 01:49:43,835
- Yeah, a couple mill comin' in like a week.
- Yeah.

2144
01:49:43,878 --> 01:49:45,937
And when it gets here, I'll give
you a call, you come pick it up.

2145
01:49:48,949 --> 01:49:50,746
You give me a call?

2146
01:49:51,918 --> 01:49:55,718
When it gets here, I'll give you
a call, and you come pick it up.

2147
01:49:55,756 --> 01:49:57,655
Well, we don't fuckin'
work for you, man!

2148
01:49:57,690 --> 01:49:57,951
Shh..

2149
01:49:57,957 --> 01:50:00,824
Sweetheart, you have my
money taped to your tits.

2150
01:50:00,860 --> 01:50:02,828
Okay? Technically you do work for me.

2151
01:50:05,865 --> 01:50:07,661
Hey, Jordan, we're gonna need to talk.

2152
01:50:07,699 --> 01:50:09,894
If I fuckin' do this, I'm telling
you right now, I ain't goin' to him.

2153
01:50:09,934 --> 01:50:12,836
Okay? I'm not a fuckin' schwas, I
don't do fuckin' pick-ups, alright?

2154
01:50:12,872 --> 01:50:14,737
- But listen to me, when this thing placed,
- I'm gonna take care of everything.

2155
01:50:14,774 --> 01:50:16,799
and I fuckin' say, and you
tell that fuckin' piece of shit.

2156
01:50:16,842 --> 01:50:17,899
- If he comes correct.
- I will.

2157
01:50:17,942 --> 01:50:22,709
If he comes in, I'll fuckin' loopy and fucked up.
I swear to God, I'm a mash that douchebag's teeth.

2158
01:50:22,747 --> 01:50:24,715
I hear that, who's fucking cheating?

2159
01:50:24,749 --> 01:50:26,649
- Who's fuckin' cheating?!
- Look, may I asking..

2160
01:50:26,684 --> 01:50:28,810
I put the money on that
fuckin' table, not you!

2161
01:50:28,852 --> 01:50:30,786
I'm the reason we
have this fuckin' deal!

2162
01:50:30,788 --> 01:50:32,722
- I have a gun, you fucking idiot!
- What the fuck this gun.

2163
01:50:32,756 --> 01:50:33,814
I already told you this.

2164
01:50:33,857 --> 01:50:37,759
You know what? You're a fuckin' pill
deal, I got five more just like you, bro!

2165
01:50:37,795 --> 01:50:39,694
Keep talking, you piece of shit!

2166
01:50:39,695 --> 01:50:41,788
Do you know what? You dress like shit!

2167
01:50:41,831 --> 01:50:43,822
- So, fuck you!
- Fuck you, motherfucker!

2168
01:50:43,866 --> 01:50:46,699
- Jesus!
- Like that faggot. Who's the faggot?

2169
01:50:46,702 --> 01:50:47,760
- Enough with your shit!
- You okay?

2170
01:50:47,804 --> 01:50:48,770
Hey pal!

2171
01:50:50,872 --> 01:50:53,807
The next day, aunt Emma flew to Geneve.

2172
01:50:53,842 --> 01:50:56,676
Two million in cash in her carry on.

2173
01:50:56,712 --> 01:50:59,680
Which in a big picture was
a drop in the Swiss bucket.

2174
01:51:00,715 --> 01:51:03,775
'Cause the following month,
over the course of six roundtrips,

2175
01:51:03,819 --> 01:51:06,131
Chantelle's family and friends smugglin'

2176
01:51:06,132 --> 01:51:08,847
over 20 millon in cash
without even a hiccup.

2177
01:51:08,857 --> 01:51:10,847
- Shred it.
- And by the way..

2178
01:51:10,891 --> 01:51:14,793
- Here they are.
- Excellent!

2179
01:51:14,795 --> 01:51:16,786
- And I have some more.
- Really?

2180
01:51:16,864 --> 01:51:17,888
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.

2181
01:51:17,898 --> 01:51:19,831
- And here.
- Welcome.

2182
01:51:19,866 --> 01:51:21,697
[LAUGHING] Welcome?

2183
01:51:21,734 --> 01:51:24,669
- And yeah, like four bags of it.
- Ooh.

2184
01:51:24,938 --> 01:51:27,736
Are you Swiss-Slovakian
or Swiss-Slovenian?

2185
01:51:27,774 --> 01:51:29,765
- Slovenian. Yes.
- Slovenian? Okay.

2186
01:51:29,776 --> 01:51:32,744
- So you're blonde?
- Oh, stop that.

2187
01:51:52,797 --> 01:51:53,729
Shit.

2188
01:51:53,764 --> 01:51:57,825
Put the fuckin' car
parked, you dumb idiot!

2189
01:51:57,869 --> 01:52:00,633
Yeah, close the briefcase.

2190
01:52:00,671 --> 01:52:03,696
One fuckin' day, one fuckin' day
you couldn't keep it together?

2191
01:52:03,740 --> 01:52:05,765
I was fucked up, Brad.

2192
01:52:05,809 --> 01:52:07,777
- You're fuckin' kidding me!
- Fucked up.

2193
01:52:13,248 --> 01:52:15,011
- It's a joke!
- It's a joke?

2194
01:52:15,050 --> 01:52:17,143
- I'm sober.
- Jesus fucking Christ.

2195
01:52:17,186 --> 01:52:19,984
- It's a fuckin' joke. I'm not stupid.
- Are you fuckin' stupid?

2196
01:52:19,988 --> 01:52:21,182
- You fuckin' drivin' you like a fuckin' maniac.
- Do you know what..

2197
01:52:21,223 --> 01:52:23,395
- You know the attention
that fuckin' draws?

2198
01:52:23,396 --> 01:52:24,988
- You know what, I'm not stupid.

2199
01:52:25,026 --> 01:52:26,015
- I'm smart.
- Smart?

2200
01:52:26,060 --> 01:52:28,086
- I make million dollar deal.
- That's right.

2201
01:52:28,130 --> 01:52:30,963
We smart important people, unlike you.

2202
01:52:30,966 --> 01:52:34,230
People who don't sucker punch
people when they're scared, okay?

2203
01:52:34,969 --> 01:52:35,993
- I'm scared?
- And by the way,

2204
01:52:36,037 --> 01:52:38,130
- I haven't got an apology for that.
- One apology, okay.

2205
01:52:38,172 --> 01:52:40,037
I check my fuckin' messages everyday

2206
01:52:40,074 --> 01:52:41,006
- when I come home from work
- Did you?

2207
01:52:41,042 --> 01:52:42,031
- my answering machine
- You didn't got one, huh?

2208
01:52:42,043 --> 01:52:44,135
zero! I got a blinking light
because I don't have shit from you!

2209
01:52:44,177 --> 01:52:45,409
- Yeah right. You know, you got a big

2210
01:52:45,410 --> 01:52:46,975
fuckin' mouth!
- I got my wife, I got my wife

2211
01:52:47,013 --> 01:52:49,140
checking the messages every 45
minutes, calling the office say,

2212
01:52:49,182 --> 01:52:52,947
has Brad apologize? Is there any
apology message on the machine?

2213
01:52:52,985 --> 01:52:54,043
- Alright, do you know what..
- I don't have jack shit.

2214
01:52:54,086 --> 01:52:55,571
- You know what? That's
not how you treat me.

2215
01:52:55,572 --> 01:52:57,055
- Yeah, you got a big
fuckin' mouth. You know

2216
01:52:57,089 --> 01:52:58,954
I'm not gonna give you a fuckin'
pass, just give me the case.

2217
01:52:58,991 --> 01:53:01,118
- Oh, you're not gonna give me a pass?
- Get out of here.

2218
01:53:01,160 --> 01:53:02,218
Look, it's a figure fuckin' speech.

2219
01:53:02,261 --> 01:53:04,956
- Oh my God, the Emperor of Foxville
- Just give me the fuckin' case

2220
01:53:04,996 --> 01:53:07,089
came down from Foxville
to give me a pass!

2221
01:53:07,131 --> 01:53:08,567
Hey, what are the citizens of Foxville

2222
01:53:08,568 --> 01:53:10,191
doing at the day when
the Emperor's gone?

2223
01:53:10,235 --> 01:53:12,204
- I'm begging you.
- Is it, is it mayhem?

2224
01:53:12,238 --> 01:53:14,102
Or people looting and raping?

2225
01:53:14,138 --> 01:53:16,003
What all the little fuckhead doing?

2226
01:53:16,040 --> 01:53:16,972
- Why are you here?
- You go fuck yourself!

2227
01:53:17,008 --> 01:53:19,033
- You fuckin', alright, alright.
- Hey, you fuck the back up!

2228
01:53:19,077 --> 01:53:20,237
I'm fuckin' saying!

2229
01:53:20,945 --> 01:53:24,937
That if I ever cross you in my
life, if you come at me again,

2230
01:53:25,015 --> 01:53:26,141
- Just fuckin' keep it down.
- You know what?

2231
01:53:26,183 --> 01:53:32,144
I got it. I don't want to be avoiding
anything, but I think you like, like..

2232
01:53:32,155 --> 01:53:33,179
- Like, when you come at me,
- What the fuck?

2233
01:53:33,223 --> 01:53:35,087
- 'cause you look at me.
- what's the matter with you?

2234
01:53:35,124 --> 01:53:38,093
I just know I just noticed like,
you have like a fuckin', like..

2235
01:53:38,127 --> 01:53:39,094
- Stop that talk!
- You might twinkle.

2236
01:53:39,128 --> 01:53:41,995
You have like a twinkle, were
you trying to kiss me, bro?

2237
01:53:41,998 --> 01:53:43,090
- Jesus fuckin' Christ..
- Bro, you're trying..

2238
01:53:43,132 --> 01:53:45,190
- I'm.. What's with you?
- I have like a, I don't know, I just..

2239
01:53:45,967 --> 01:53:47,161
- I said that homophobic thing..
- Baiklah.

2240
01:53:47,168 --> 01:53:49,068
- You're just not the one for me, pal.
- Okay.

2241
01:53:49,104 --> 01:53:52,005
You know what I mean? It's not,
it's not about that for me, you know?

2242
01:53:52,040 --> 01:53:53,132
- You understand?
- I've heard enough, please.

2243
01:53:53,174 --> 01:53:55,038
I'm begging, give me the fuckin' case.

2244
01:53:55,042 --> 01:53:56,009
- Okay?

01:53:56,043 --> 01:53:57,978
- Gve me the case. What's that?
- You gotta do me one favour.

2246
01:53:58,013 --> 01:53:59,173
You gotta take this case,

2247
01:53:59,180 --> 01:54:01,080
you gotta drive straight home, you know.

2248
01:54:01,116 --> 01:54:02,947
I need you to open up the briefcase,

2249
01:54:02,951 --> 01:54:06,943
and you take out every single dollar,
don't leave one dollar inside the briefcase.

2250
01:54:06,987 --> 01:54:09,956
I want you to have it all neatly
organized outside the briefcase,

2251
01:54:09,990 --> 01:54:11,048
and you to take it,

2252
01:54:11,091 --> 01:54:14,151
I need you to shove it right up your
wife's Slatvian cunt, you understand?

2253
01:54:14,194 --> 01:54:16,127
- My fuckin' wife?
- Fuckin' chill!

2254
01:54:16,162 --> 01:54:18,027
- [GROANING] Chill, bro!
- You motherfuckin' piece of shit!

2255
01:54:18,064 --> 01:54:20,032
- How about that?
- Let go, let go! Come on. Fuck!

2256
01:54:20,066 --> 01:54:22,034
[SIREN]

2257
01:54:22,101 --> 01:54:23,966
Motherfucker! You fuckin' dick!

2258
01:54:23,970 --> 01:54:26,938
Stop! Don't move! Don't move,
I'm gonna fire your fuckin' leg!

2259
01:54:26,972 --> 01:54:28,963
I'm gonna fire you in your fuckin' leg!

2260
01:54:29,007 --> 01:54:31,066
Drop the case, put your hands in the air!

2261
01:54:31,109 --> 01:54:32,007
Get that!

2262
01:54:32,044 --> 01:54:33,011
[SCREAMING]

2263
01:54:33,011 --> 01:54:35,138
Get on your knees, sir!
Get down on your knees!

2264
01:54:35,180 --> 01:54:37,170
Motherfucker!

2265
01:54:37,214 --> 01:54:38,977
Fuck! Jesus!

2266
01:54:39,016 --> 01:54:40,176
Mother fucker!

2267
01:54:49,026 --> 01:54:50,015
Jordan!

2268
01:54:50,027 --> 01:54:52,928
Do I have a surprise for you.

2269
01:54:53,197 --> 01:54:55,097
20 real lemons.

2270
01:54:55,166 --> 01:54:57,224
Retired pharmacist friend of mine,
it been in his safe for 15 years.

2271
01:54:57,968 --> 01:54:59,196
You fuckin' kiddin' me? Lemons?

2272
01:54:59,235 --> 01:55:02,204
- [LAUGHING]
- They're gonna knock us out off our fuckin' head.

2273
01:55:02,238 --> 01:55:07,197
When it comes to quaalude, the
lemon 714 was the holygrail.

2274
01:55:07,209 --> 01:55:09,006
- Can you believe it?
- Oh my God..

2275
01:55:09,044 --> 01:55:10,011
I thought they were like a myth.

2276
01:55:10,045 --> 01:55:12,946
Three times as powerful as
anything available today.

2277
01:55:12,948 --> 01:55:16,145
- Look at these babies.
- Boy Donnie really knew how to celebrate.

2278
01:55:16,185 --> 01:55:18,508
He said he was saving
these for a special

2279
01:55:18,509 --> 01:55:21,053
occasion, like a birthday,
or being clapfree.

2280
01:55:21,089 --> 01:55:23,057
Or, my money arriving
safely in Switzerland.

2281
01:55:23,091 --> 01:55:24,183
We're gonna die!

2282
01:55:24,225 --> 01:55:27,194
[PUKE]

2283
01:55:27,228 --> 01:55:29,992
So that night, I cleared my schedule,

2284
01:55:29,998 --> 01:55:34,025
and I rid my body of anything
that could fuck with my high.

2285
01:55:34,068 --> 01:55:36,127
It was celebration time.

2286
01:55:36,170 --> 01:55:37,932
Okay.

2287
01:55:37,971 --> 01:55:39,097
We start off with one, see how it'll go?

2288
01:55:39,106 --> 01:55:41,074
My guy says all we need is one.

2289
01:55:41,074 --> 01:55:42,006
Here we go.

2290
01:55:43,143 --> 01:55:45,008
- Salute.
- Cheers.

2291
01:55:45,045 --> 01:55:47,979
Maybe if I pull it
again, it will go down.

2292
01:55:49,215 --> 01:55:51,911
Steve,Steve! I gotta get outta here.

2293
01:55:51,951 --> 01:55:54,010
No! I think I got it figured out.

2294
01:55:54,053 --> 01:55:57,989
It must be one pull for
up, and two pull for down.

2295
01:55:58,024 --> 01:55:59,047
Okay.

2296
01:56:07,198 --> 01:56:08,994
You feel anything?

2297
01:56:12,069 --> 01:56:13,935
No.

2298
01:56:16,007 --> 01:56:17,941
Been thirty five minutes.

2299
01:56:20,144 --> 01:56:23,944
Maybe we built up a tolerance
after all these years, huh?

2300
01:56:25,249 --> 01:56:27,012
Hm..

2301
01:56:37,026 --> 01:56:38,084
This is bullshit!

2302
01:56:38,127 --> 01:56:41,186
My metabolism is pumped
out, I can't feel shit!

2303
01:56:41,229 --> 01:56:44,062
They're old, I think
they lost the potency?

2304
01:56:44,066 --> 01:56:45,033
Huh?

2305
01:56:45,100 --> 01:56:46,124
Check the bottle!

2306
01:56:49,937 --> 01:56:51,063
January '81

2307
01:56:51,105 --> 01:56:52,129
They're fuckin' duds.

2308
01:56:52,139 --> 01:56:54,164
- Fuck!
- Let's take a..

2309
01:56:54,208 --> 01:56:56,176
- Take two more each.
- Yeah.

2310
01:56:58,079 --> 01:56:59,980
Jordan!

2311
01:56:59,981 --> 01:57:01,038
You're up, babe?

2312
01:57:04,118 --> 01:57:05,983
What are you two retards doing?

2313
01:57:06,020 --> 01:57:07,078
We're workin' out, honey.

2314
01:57:08,022 --> 01:57:09,922
Well, Bo Dietl's on the phone.

2315
01:57:09,957 --> 01:57:12,083
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay?

2316
01:57:14,027 --> 01:57:15,016
Hey! Bo, what's going on?

2317
01:57:15,061 --> 01:57:16,926
Jordan, listen to me clearly.

2318
01:57:16,963 --> 01:57:19,090
I can not talk to you in this
phone, and I have to talk with you.

2319
01:57:19,099 --> 01:57:20,929
We're gonna get outta
here. What's going on?

2320
01:57:20,966 --> 01:57:24,094
Listen to me, leave the
fuckin' house, Jordan!

2321
01:57:24,136 --> 01:57:28,004
And then call me from a payphone.
This is not a fuckin' joke, Jordan.

2322
01:57:28,040 --> 01:57:29,132
Yeah, yeah. Ya.

2323
01:57:30,142 --> 01:57:32,006
- Shit!
- What's.. What he said?

2324
01:57:32,043 --> 01:57:33,943
I don't know what the fuck
is going on, I gotta go!

2325
01:57:33,978 --> 01:57:35,036
Is everything okay, Jordan?

2326
01:57:45,189 --> 01:57:50,092
The closest payphone I can get to
is at the Brookvile Contry Club.

2327
01:57:50,128 --> 01:57:52,095
It was a real WASP stronghold.

2328
01:57:52,129 --> 01:57:54,927
Just a mile down the road from my house.

2329
01:58:04,940 --> 01:58:05,965
Hey Bo, what's up? It's me, what's going

2330
01:58:05,966 --> 01:58:07,067
on? I'm at the payphone,
what's going on?

2331
01:58:07,076 --> 01:58:08,043
Listen to me carefully.

2332
01:58:08,110 --> 01:58:11,011
Please, your little friend
here, Brad, your little buddy,

2333
01:58:11,013 --> 01:58:12,071
he's in jail.

2334
01:58:12,114 --> 01:58:14,172
He.. What the fuck he's in
jail for? What did he do?

2335
01:58:14,182 --> 01:58:15,171
I don't know what he did.

2336
01:58:15,216 --> 01:58:19,118
My friend in Long Island told me he got
picked up in some fuckin' shopping mall,

2337
01:58:19,154 --> 01:58:22,180
- he got locked up..
- Wait, did you say a shopping mall?

2338
01:58:22,923 --> 01:58:24,015
- Yeah, yeah.
- He, he was with Donnie

2339
01:58:24,057 --> 01:58:27,026
he was supposed to deliver some money,
and that fuckin' fat piece of shit.

2340
01:58:27,060 --> 01:58:28,960
- I'm gonna go and fuckin' kill him.
- Jordan, Jordan, Jordan. Listen to me!

2341
01:58:28,962 --> 01:58:30,088
Don't go! Listen to me.

2342
01:58:30,130 --> 01:58:32,997
That guy, Denham, that FBI agent guy,

2343
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:36,959
somebody told me, he's got your phone
tapped. Your ofice and your home.

2344
01:58:37,004 --> 01:58:40,064
- Don't talk on that motherfuckin' phone!
- Okay. Fuck! I got it, I got it.

2345
01:58:40,140 --> 01:58:41,107
I got it, I got it.

2346
01:58:41,108 --> 01:58:42,973
Jordan.

2347
01:58:43,010 --> 01:58:46,172
You didn't try to bribe this
fuckin' FBI agent, did you?

2348
01:58:46,212 --> 01:58:48,976
No, I didn't try to
bribe that FBI agent.

2349
01:58:48,981 --> 01:58:50,107
You think I'm that fuckin'stupid? No!

2350
01:58:50,149 --> 01:58:52,117
What the fuck you said?

02:36:09,685 --> 02:36:10,811
He's got good sense.

3027
02:36:10,853 --> 02:36:12,786
What are you, Craskin?

3028
02:36:12,954 --> 02:36:15,513
Full cooperation, he
provides us with the

3029
02:36:15,514 --> 02:36:18,589
comprehensive list of all
coconspirators spanning

3030
02:36:18,590 --> 02:36:21,727
the last seven years and
he agrees to wear a wire.

3031
02:36:21,931 --> 02:36:24,831
- Did you just say wear a wire?
- A wire.

3032
02:36:24,933 --> 02:36:27,800
Wow, wow, is that means, you
want me to rat, is that it?

3033
02:36:27,836 --> 02:36:29,667
No, i want you to cooperate.

3034
02:36:29,704 --> 02:36:31,797
- No, you want me to rat.
- Yes, we want you to rat.

3035
02:36:31,840 --> 02:36:35,900
That fucking exactly what
we want you to do, to rat.

3036
02:36:39,847 --> 02:36:41,644
How is Christy's party?

3037
02:36:41,782 --> 02:36:44,750
- Fine.
- Good.

3038
02:36:45,685 --> 02:36:47,778
Babe, i've spoke to the lawyers again today.

3039
02:36:47,854 --> 02:36:51,790
There is some really really great news.

3040
02:36:52,659 --> 02:36:55,855
Turns out you completely
off the hook, honey.

3041
02:36:55,894 --> 02:36:57,759
I know that already.

3042
02:36:57,796 --> 02:37:02,927
Right, exactly, you never did
anything wrong in first place right?

3043
02:37:03,702 --> 02:37:09,868
It turns out, all the FBI really
wants for me is to a coorperate.

3044
02:37:09,908 --> 02:37:12,413
You know.. turns out i
have so much information

3045
02:37:12,414 --> 02:37:14,708
about the stock market
and the Wallstreet..

3046
02:37:14,745 --> 02:37:17,267
That i could save the
government years of

3047
02:37:17,268 --> 02:37:19,910
heartache not to mention
countless dollars.

3048
02:37:21,719 --> 02:37:23,653
It gets even better babe.

3049
02:37:23,688 --> 02:37:29,626
Because if i do to sign cooperate, i might
only be looking at 4 short years.

3050
02:37:29,693 --> 02:37:33,823
How much case, we could start
fresh maybe sell the house.

3051
02:37:33,830 --> 02:37:37,697
And any fine that i have to pay
wouldn't due till i serve term.

3052
02:37:37,733 --> 02:37:41,692
So, we still have plenty
money left over, you know.

3053
02:37:42,705 --> 02:37:47,801
You think, of course bug me out a little
bit is this whole idea for doing it.

3054
02:37:47,842 --> 02:37:49,810
Give an information about my friends.

3055
02:37:49,911 --> 02:37:53,678
Ohh, like he said, ther is
no friend on Wallstrett right.

3056
02:37:53,682 --> 02:37:54,774
Right.

3057
02:37:54,850 --> 02:37:58,842
It's exactly silver lining to that
too honey because they said eventually.

3058
02:37:58,887 --> 02:38:01,754
Eventually everyone gonna have to
give an information on this case.

3059
02:38:01,789 --> 02:38:04,815
So at the end of the day, might
not even a factor, you know.

3060
02:38:04,826 --> 02:38:08,818
- Well, that's a good news, right.
- Yeah, yeah.

3061
02:38:08,862 --> 02:38:10,921
