{2045}{2135}{y:i}There's a moment of orderly silence|before a football play begins.
{2137}{2208}{y:i}Players are in position,|linemen are frozen,
{2210}{2243}{y:i}and anything's possible.
{2245}{2348}{y:i}TV commentary
{2356}{2458}{y:i}Then, like a traffic accident,|staff begins to randomly collide.
{2480}{2543}{y:i}From the snap of the ball|to the snap of the first bone
{2545}{2612}{y:i}is closer to four seconds than five.
{2619}{2742}{y:i}TV commentary
{2810}{2840}{y:i}One Mississippi.
{2842}{2894}{y:i}Joe Theismann,|the Redskins quarterback
{2896}{2949}{y:i}takes the snap and hands off|to his running back.
{2951}{2992}{y:i}TV commentary
{2994}{3033}{y:i}Two Mississippi.
{3035}{3091}{y:i}It's a trick play, a flea flicker,
{3093}{3164}{y:i}and the running back tosses the ball|back to the quarterback.
{3166}{3210}{y:i}TV commentary
{3234}{3262}{y:i}Three Mississippi.
{3264}{3364}{y:i}Up to now the play's been defined|by the what the quarterback sees.
{3366}{3441}{y:i}It's about to be defined|by what he doesn't.
{3467}{3496}{y:i}Four Mississippi.
{3498}{3587}{y:i}Lawrence Taylor is the best|defensive player in the NFL
{3589}{3674}{y:i}and has been from the time he stepped|onto the field as a rookie.
{3676}{3747}{y:i}TV commentary
{3753}{3863}{y:i}TV commentary
{3867}{3950}{y:i}He will also change the game of football|as we know it.
{3952}{4016}{y:i}...And we'll look at it|with the reverse angle one more time.
{4018}{4092}{y:i}And I suggest if your stomach is weak|you just don't watch ...
{4094}{4207}{y:i}Legendary quarterback Joe Thiessman|never played another down of football.
{4257}{4315}{y:i}Now, y'all would guess|that more often than not
{4317}{4400}{y:i}the highest paid player on|an NFL team is the quarterback.
{4402}{4432}{y:i}And you'd be right.
{4434}{4502}{y:i}What you probably don't know|is that more often than not
{4504}{4590}{y:i}the second highest paid player is,|thanks to Lawrence Taylor,
{4592}{4623}{y:i}a left tackle.
{4625}{4671}{y:i}Because, as every housewife knows,
{4673}{4722}{y:i}the first check you write|is for the mortgage
{4724}{4789}{y:i}but the second is for the insurence.
{4791}{4857}{y:i}And the left tackle's job|is to protect the quarterback
{4859}{4940}{y:i}form what he can't see coming.|To protect his blind side.
{4950}{5042}{y:i}The ideal left tackle is big,|but a lot od people are big.
{5045}{5115}{y:i}He is wide in the butt|and massive in the thighs.
{5117}{5216}{y:i}He has long arms, giant hands|and feet as quick as a hiccup.
{5268}{5331}{y:i}This is a rare and expensive combination
{5333}{5401}{y:i}the need for which can be traced|to that Monday night game
{5403}{5450}{y:i}and Lawrence Taylor.
{5454}{5547}{y:i}For on that day he not only|altered Joe Theismann's life,
{5568}{5606}{y:i}but mine as well.
{5756}{5792}Mr. Oher?
{5805}{5841}Mr. Oher?
{5857}{5935}Do you understand..?|Do you know why I'm here?
{5953}{5995}To... investigate?
{5997}{6044}Yes. To investigate.
{6082}{6170}Im here to investigate your odd...|predicament.
{6190}{6258}Do you find the odd?|Your predicament?
{6303}{6340}Michael?...
{6359}{6399}Iono.|[I don't know]
{6433}{6473}Can I... can I leave now?
{6475}{6514}No. You can't.
{7127}{7207}# Strange face, with your eyes #
{7256}{7333}# So pale and sincere #
{7371}{7461}# Underneath, you know well #
{7495}{7585}# You have nothing to fear #
{7648}{7735}# For the dreams that came to you #
{7752}{7807}# when you were young #
{7893}{7978}# Told of a life where #
{8014}{8112}# Spring has crawled #
{8353}{8444}# You would seem so frail #
{8488}{8560}# In the cold of the night #
{8599}{8689}# When the armies of emotion #
{8732}{8805}# Go out to fight #
{8871}{8940}# But while the earth #
{8978}{9056}# sinks to its grave #
{9120}{9198}# You sail to the sky #
{9217}{9313}# On the crest of a wave #
{9617}{9668}They say you the coach.
{9681}{9720}Bert Cotton.
{9734}{9819}Tony Hamilton, but everybody|just calls me big Tony.
{9921}{9978}Hey, Big Mike! Check it out.
{10029}{10072}Not even locked!
{10103}{10155}White people are crazy.
{10244}{10309}I promises my mama Boo, on her deathbed
{10311}{10400}that I'd get my son Steven outta|public school and into a church school.
{10402}{10500}I appreciate that, Tony.|But I'm not involved with admissions.
{10516}{10575}This figured maybe I'd come|to talk to you,
{10577}{10651}seeing as you might need some players.
{10656}{10687}What kind of sport|is he playing?
{10689}{10764}Anything with a ball.|Boy's good, too.
{10770}{10868}Classes start in a week. It would|have to be for the next semester.
{10873}{10976}I know, what you're thinking, Coach.|But, look here, I got money, alright?
{10983}{11072}See I'm mechanic at Wilson's Auto|t'other side of town.
{11077}{11156}Look, what if somebody drops out|or moves?
{11163}{11209}Could they get in then?
{11211}{11268}"They?"|You only mentioned one son.
{11270}{11348}That's right, Steven.|But there's another boy.
{11372}{11421}- Another boy?|- Yeah.
{11507}{11543}Big Mike.
{11547}{11590}Sleeps on my coach|from time to time.
{11592}{11656}It's a bad deal. You know,|his mama's on the crack pipe.
{11658}{11703}He ain't got nobody else.
{11705}{11750}He just wanted to come along|for the ride.
{11752}{11802}- They're here?|- Yeah.
{11816}{11877}The little one is Steven
{11902}{11942}and the big one...
{11944}{11980}Big Mike.
{12189}{12224}Switch!
{12293}{12329}{y:i}Mike!
{12381}{12416}Come on!
{12580}{12624}Mother of God....
{12654}{12722}Steven Hamilton's paperwork|looks acceptable to me.
{12724}{12777}And I believe he would do fine.
{12779}{12826}- But this other kid...|- Big Mike.
{12828}{12913}Michael Oher gives us|no reason to believe it,
{12923}{13001}based on his record,|that he would be successful here.
{13007}{13038}How bad could it be?
{13040}{13127}We're not exactly sure how old|he is due to lack of records.
{13129}{13214}He has a measured IQ of 80.|Which is 6th percentile.
{13216}{13286}His grade point average begins with zero.
{13288}{13321}Zero-point-six.
{13323}{13372}Everyone passed him along
{13374}{13486}they gave him D's so they could hand|their problem off to the next school.
{13502}{13546}It's a brave kid.
{13601}{13652}For wanting to come here.
{13654}{13711}For wanting a quality education.
{13713}{13823}An education denied him by the poor|quality of the schools he's attended.
{13825}{13862}I tell you most kids|with his background
{13864}{13917}wouldn't come within two hundred miles|of this place.
{13919}{14040}Coach Cotton, we understand your interest|in this young man's athletic abilities.
{14044}{14115}Now, he wouldn't be able to play sports|until he got his grades up anyway.
{14117}{14163}Forget sports!
{14170}{14213}Look at the wall.
{14215}{14243}Christian.
{14245}{14328}We either take that seriously|or we paint over it.
{14336}{14415}You don't admit Michael Oher|because of sports,
{14424}{14505}you admit him|because it's the right thing to do.
{15589}{15651}Class, this is Michael Oher|and he's new here
{15653}{15718}so I expect you all|to make him feel welcome.
{15720}{15782}Mike, just take any empty seat.
{15858}{15967}This is a quiz based on the information|you learned last year
{15969}{16019}in your science curriculum.
{16021}{16090}Don't worry.|It's not gonna be graded.
{16096}{16160}I just want to see how much|information we need to hit again.
{16162}{16222}Just answer whatever you know.
{16999}{17035}Thank you.
{17449}{17506}- Can I leave now?|- Yeah.
{17631}{17673}Take your book.
{18117}{18164}{y:i}Why should he always stay in our home?
{18166}{18220}{y:i}- He's gonna eat all our food.|- This is not true.
{18222}{18260}{y:i}I try to be Christian abot the son,|alright?
{18262}{18318}{y:i}Let somebody else be|Christian about this kid.
{18320}{18399}{y:i}You want me to throw him out|on the street like some dog?
{18401}{18447}{y:i}Let somebody else take|over the responsibility!
{18449}{18516}{y:i}Should I throw him out|on the street?
{18518}{18572}{y:i}He's here all the time.|I just want to be with you!
{18574}{18629}{y:i}Alright. Alright.
{18633}{18684}{y:i}You win. I'll take care of it.
{18795}{18854}I don't care if Patrick Ramsey|approved the chair.
{18856}{18943}He's the NFL quarterback|not Martha frickin' Stewart.
{18946}{19044}Because there's a difference between|Bunny Williams and a La-Z-boy.
{19046}{19110}No. See, when MTV Cribs|comes to his house
{19112}{19156}he's gonna be showing off|his home theatre
{19158}{19214}all I'm gonna see is|a brown Barca-lounger.
{19216}{19290}No. No, listen to me.|I'm the designer, my name's on it.
{19292}{19366}Deliver what I ordered!|Alright? Thank you.
{19701}{19758}- What'd I miss?|- Collins has just got a dig.
{19760}{19850}It's a girl's volleyball, Mom.|You didn't miss anything.
{19925}{20004}- Come on Collins! Move your feet! Come on!|- Good job, Collins!
{20006}{20042}Go!
{20126}{20162}Collins, we're gonna wait|for you outside.
{20164}{20218}But don't double condition in|the shower, you have homework!
{20220}{20261}I'm going over to Cannon's to study.
{20263}{20336}SJ! SJ, do not go to the|broad locker room again.
{20339}{20393}Come here!|SJ, come here!
{20702}{20766}Well, the big kid's been here|for a month
{20783}{20829}he's still not cutting in my class.
{20831}{20870}Why this Admissions do this?
{20872}{20923}I mean, it's not fair to us or the boy.
{20925}{20966}Just setting him up to fail.
{20968}{21025}I don't think, he has any idea|what I'm teaching.
{21027}{21112}And how would you know if he did?|He won't even talk.
{21114}{21181}- He writes.|- His name. Barely.
{21212}{21289}He thew this in the trash can.
{21367}{21433}"I look and I see white everywhere:
{21437}{21544}white walls, white floors,|and a lot of white people.
{21572}{21685}The teachers do not know I have no idea|of anything they are talking about.
{21693}{21775}I do not want to listen to anyone,|especially the teachers.
{21777}{21831}They are giving homework|and expecting me
{21833}{21883}to do problems on my own.
{21906}{21974}I have never done homework|in my life.
{21982}{22079}I go to the bathroom,|look in the mirror and say,
{22104}{22160}"This is not Michael Oher."
{22262}{22317}He entitled it "White Walls."
{22319}{22365}How's the spelling?
{22648}{22683}Hi.
{22859}{22898}Smile at 'em.
{22900}{22967}And that let them know|you're their friend.
{23066}{23118}You're Big Mike, right?
{23129}{23200}I'm Sean.|But everyone calls me SJ.
{23212}{23247}It's for Sean junior,
{23249}{23308}my Father's name is Sean. Sean Tuohy.
{23315}{23371}He was a basketball star|at Ole Miss, point guard,
{23373}{23433}now he owns like|a million Taco Bells.
{23526}{23561}Maana'.
{23685}{23741}- Who's that SJ?|- Big Mike.
{23774}{23840}Get you feet off my dash.
{23851}{23918}Thank you. Put on your seatbelt!
{24098}{24134}Big Mike?
{24208}{24301}Mike, I got a call from someone|at the police departement.
{24402}{24492}Do you remember the story in the papers|while back about...
{24494}{24589}a man who fell off an overpass?
{24615}{24740}No one knew who he was|and or he jumped, or...
{24810}{24896}Umm... anyway he...|he passed away.
{24992}{25052}Mike, the man was your father.
{25134}{25205}They've been looking for somebody to|notify and they...
{25207}{25276}They found your name on our registry.
{25330}{25380}I'm really sorry, son.
{25513}{25560}You were close to him?
{25666}{25730}When's the last time you saw him?
{25856}{25895}Iono.
{28127}{28199}- He knows it!|- Who knows it and what is he know?
{28201}{28286}The material. Michael Oher.|I gave him this test verbally.
{28288}{28332}- Got even allowed?|- I see.
{28334}{28401}- On how big a curve?|- He's been listening all along.
{28403}{28484}It's amazing what he's absorbed.|Trust me. He's listening to you, too.
{28486}{28545}Now, his reading level is low
{28547}{28622}and he's got no idea how to learn|in the classroom.
{28637}{28745}I'm not saying he's going to pass|but Big Mike is not stupid.
{28756}{28779}- Hey.|- What, Mom?
{28781}{28811}- Good job.|- Yes?
{28813}{28856}Good job.|Hey, I got a question for you.
{28858}{28887}Go.
{28889}{28941}There was a little girl|about two rows back.
{28943}{28972}What was her name?
{28974}{29031}- Oh, that was Chimsey.|- Kinsey. Yeah.
{29033}{29086}I saw your little indian feathers|get all ruffle up.
{29088}{29126}Yeah. It's nice.
{29132}{29203}SJ, don't let this go to your head|but I've thought you were
{29205}{29250}very convincing in the role of...
{29252}{29298}- Indian Number Three.|- Yes.
{29300}{29385}I tried out for the Chief|but they gave it to Andy Sung.
{29387}{29488}I can't be sure, but I think there was|some multi-cultural bias thing working.
{29490}{29554}Or maybe they just thought|he'd make a better Chief.
{29556}{29603}Dad, he's like Chinese.
{29605}{29642}Yeah. You're Irish.
{29644}{29696}And if you weren't the Chief,|how did you get that headdress?
{29698}{29798}Dad, I'm gonna need a few more|of those free Quesadilla tickets.
{29842}{29898}And where does the acorn fall?
{29900}{29976}Hey, don't laugh too hard.|The Quesadilla saved our ass.
{29978}{30029}Don't use the a-word.
{30160}{30207}What is he wearing?
{30226}{30262}It's freezing.
{30273}{30302}What's his name again?
{30304}{30340}Big Mike.
{30355}{30404}Where's he going?
{30436}{30498}Hey, Big Mike!|Where you headin'?
{30516}{30552}Gym....
{30567}{30603}Okay.
{30875}{30913}Turn around.
{31083}{31136}Big Mike...|Stop the car.
{31256}{31291}Big Mike.
{31304}{31366}Hey, my name is Leigh Anne Tuohy.|My kids go to Wingate.
{31368}{31432}You said you're going to the gym?
{31448}{31492}The school gym's closed.
{31494}{31544}Why were you going to the gym?
{31581}{31653}Big Mike?!|Why were you going to the gym?
{31670}{31721}Because... it's warm.
{31754}{31824}Do you have any place to stay tonight?
{31839}{31893}Don't you dare lie to me.
{32181}{32233}I've seen that look many times.
{32238}{32284}She's about to get her way.
{32306}{32341}Come on.
{32389}{32425}Come on.
{32499}{32540}SJ, make room.
{32552}{32587}Get in the car.
{32631}{32667}Come on.
{32943}{32996}- Where are we going?|- Home.
{33363}{33417}Oh no! That's my favourite part.
{33419}{33458}So cute.
{33482}{33549}How'd the dork do|in the school play?
{33640}{33705}Umm... Okay.
{33718}{33783}Collins, you know Big Mike|from the School?
{33825}{33914}I'd give you the best bedroom|but it's full of sample boxes.
{33916}{33999}And the sectional in the family room|slides apart when you sleep on it.
{34001}{34054}At least that's what Sean says.
{34056}{34103}Mr. Tuohy sleeps on the coach?
{34105}{34145}Only when he's bad. Alright.
{34147}{34236}The powder room's right there and|we'll be upstairs if you need us.
{34238}{34280}Alright? Right.
{34295}{34332}Sleep tight, honey.
{35622}{35691}- Was this a bad idea?|- What?
{35697}{35775}Don't lie there and pretend like you're|not thinking the same thing as me.
{35777}{35809}Fine, tell me what you're thinking
{35811}{35870}so I know what's supposed to be|on my mind.
{35872}{35921}How well do you know Big Mike?
{35923}{35984}In case you haven't noticed|he doesn't have much to say.
{35986}{36071}What's the big deal?|It's just for one night, right?
{36093}{36172}It is just one night, right?|Leigh Anne?
{36219}{36295}You don't think he'll steal anything,|do you?
{36303}{36368}I guess we'll know in the morning.
{36740}{36828}Well if you hear a scream|call the insurence adjustor.
{37289}{37325}Mike?
{37554}{37590}Big Mike?!
{37619}{37655}Mike?
{37972}{38008}Big Mike!
{38213}{38271}You're gonna make me|walking away?
{38274}{38316}Alright then.
{38332}{38382}Where are you going?
{38391}{38423}Iono.
{38425}{38510}Well, are you spending Thanksgiving|with your family?

{42633}{42685}You "have" clothes.
{42689}{42781}And an extra T-shirt in the plastic bag|does not a wardrobe make.
{42783}{42821}I have clothes.
{42823}{42909}Fine, let's go get 'em.|Just tell me where I'm going.
{43142}{43232}Alright. Tell me everything|I need to know about you.

{43530}{43568}Tell you what, Big Mike.
{43570}{43629}We can do this the easy way,|or we can do it the hard way.
{43631}{43674}You take a pick.
{43750}{43783}Fine.
{43794}{43934}Tell me just one thing I should know|about you. Just... just one.

{44908}{44963}- xxx|- Do you know 'em?
{44970}{45018}Man, I got no idea.
{45026}{45084}It's where your mother lives?
{45086}{45154}- Let's go get 'em.|- No. Don't get out.
{45156}{45245}Who's going to help you carrying|your clothes, Michael?
{45297}{45351}Don't get out of the car.
{45503}{45540}No way.
{45554}{45623}Oh, that's Big Mike, man.

{47807}{47850}She wasn't home.
{47927}{47987}Well, we can come back.
{48076}{48142}She prolly moved to a nicer place.
{48409}{48516}I've lived in Memphis my whole life|and never been anywhere near here.
{48549}{48600}You're going to take care of me, right?
{48602}{48645}I got your back.
{48704}{48755}xxx
{48782}{48819}Here we go.
{48826}{48897}Oh, we also got a parole|for the ladies.
{48903}{48997}But everything we got that'd fit him|is right here.
{49050}{49083}This is it?
{49085}{49165}If this is all you got, why's it say|"Big and Tall" on the sign?
{49167}{49241}Big and Tall.|You need "Bigger and Taller."
{49300}{49355}- Howl, if you need me.|- Thank you.
{49357}{49388}You see anything, you like?
{49390}{49454}{y:i}Hey. I got a just|what you're looking for.
{49465}{49506}Well, one thing I know|about shopping is
{49508}{49583}that if you don't absolutely love it|in the store, you won't wear it.
{49585}{49639}The store is, were you like it best.
{49641}{49717}So before you choose something|think of yourself wearing it
{49719}{49793}and say to yourself:|Is this me?
{49809}{49845}{y:i}No.
{49868}{49916}What about this one?
{50039}{50087}This isn't atrocious.
{50116}{50206}Alright, well, you go look over there|I go look over here.
{50282}{50353}Who would imagine this many clothes|are plastic?
{50426}{50496}Good Lord...|What is this made of?
{50628}{50703}That's the one?|That's the one you like?
{50783}{50825}Alright then.
{51168}{51232}Have a great day.|Learn something!
{51440}{51502}Don't get your panties in a wad.
{51553}{51673}The best part about Paris was the food.|They use sauce like we use gravy.
{51681}{51753}I had to join a gym the day I got back.
{51797}{51858}Any of y'all spent much time|on the other side of town?
{51860}{51941}- Where exactly are you talking about?|- Alabama Street... Hurt Village.
{51943}{52012}Hurt Village - that sounds like a threat.
{52014}{52045}You're not far off.
{52047}{52142}- I think it might "hurt" me to go there.|- It'd hurt your reputation to go there.
{52144}{52207}Well actually I'm from there|but didn't mind hard work
{52209}{52244}and look where I am now.
{52246}{52308}Eating an eighteen dollar salad.
{52322}{52361}And it's a little soggy to be honest.
{52363}{52416}Leigh Anne? What is this sudden interest|in the project?
{52418}{52454}Is this another one|of your charities?
{52456}{52524}Wait. A project for the projects.
{52526}{52600}Oh, that's catchy.|Money would raise itself.
{52602}{52662}Okay. Count me in, Leigh Anne.
{52682}{52740}- xxx|- xxx
{52752}{52837}SJ, you have two more minutes|on that playbox thing, alright?
{52839}{52875}{y:i}Oh, Mom!
{53001}{53066}Michael, do you want to stay here?
{53127}{53221}Because... if you want to stay here...|for awhile longer...
{53238}{53327}I can find some time to figure out|a bedroom for you.
{53386}{53510}Because look at this, you've practically|ruined a ten thousand dollar coach.
{53648}{53709}You want to stay here, Michael?
{53757}{53821}I don't want to go anyplace else.
{53947}{53993}Well alright then.
{54058}{54150}- SJ, you'd better be off that playbox.|- That wasn't two minutes.
{54178}{54219}Good night Mrs. Tuohy.
{54368}{54418}I see on the admission that|we're Michael's contact
{54420}{54453}for medical emergencies?
{54455}{54494}Sean wrote that in last week.
{54496}{54583}We needed contact number and the ones|listed weren't in service.
{54585}{54633}Sean. Love that man.
{54670}{54708}What's this?
{54724}{54810}The state makes schools measure|for career aptitude in eight grade.
{54812}{54858}and this just came with his file.
{54860}{54894}What does it say|about Michael?
{54896}{55019}Spatial relations - third percentile.|Ability to learn - fifth percentile.
{55049}{55157}It's funny though. He tested in|the 98th percentile in one category.
{55161}{55242}- Which one?|- "Protective instincts."
{55293}{55392}So over here we have a desk.|Chest o'drawers.
{55403}{55477}Here's a night stand, a lamp, Alarm.
{55482}{55573}Sean says all the pro athletes use futons|if they can't find a bed big enough.
{55575}{55644}So I got you one of those|'cause frames xxx
{55646}{55737}It's not about to let that in my house.|But I got you some nicer.
{55770}{55825}- It's mine?|- Yes, sir.
{55870}{55903}What?
{55905}{55952}Never had one before.
{55954}{56008}What? A room to yourself?
{56014}{56050}A bed.
{56280}{56332}Well, you have one now.
{57102}{57168}Okay. Define Osmosis.
{57190}{57244}I think I know what.
{57260}{57335}It's when water passes|through the barrier.
{57350}{57426}That's basically right.|Michael we'll get it.
{57597}{57676}Name the combatants in the battle|of Waterloo.
{57696}{57751}I know that one. Umm...
{57765}{57856}The little guy, Napoleon...|He was on one side and...
{57884}{57949}- ...and Duku's on the other.|- Duke of Wellington.
{57951}{58028}Yeah. And the Duke of Wellington|and Russia or something.
{58030}{58066}Prussia.
{58400}{58498}Enough with the rugby shirts.|You look like a giant bumble bee.
{58566}{58690}That Taco Bell, KFC catty corner.|The Long John Silvers on the next block.
{58698}{58762}- You owe all of 'em?|- Yeah. We've got like hundreds.
{58764}{58793}Eighty five.
{58795}{58844}Is that why Mr. Tuohy don't|have to go to work?
{58846}{58938}Ho! Ho! Hey! I'm working|even when I'm not working.
{58968}{58994}What?
{58996}{59044}And y'all eat at those places for free?
{59046}{59095}All you want. It's awesome.
{59097}{59161}What do y'all do with the leftover food?|From the restaurant?
{59163}{59228}Well, we have to throw some of it away.|What's already been cooked.
{59230}{59301}- That's too bed.|- Yeah. I'd rather sell it.
{59303}{59361}Seems like you could give it away|or something?
{59363}{59456}- You should check into that, Daddy.|- Alright, I will, SJ.
{59458}{59523}How come we ain't eatin' at one|of your restaurants tonight?
{59525}{59594}Because tonight is a special occasion.
{59596}{59625}What?
{59627}{59709}I talked to Coach Cotton and he said that|Michael's grades had improved enough
{59711}{59774}that he can go out for spring football|in March.
{59776}{59802}Isn't that great?
{59804}{59876}Oh, man!|You are gonna crush some people!
{60039}{60122}- Hey, guys. How you doin'?|- Great. Thank you.
{60131}{60208}I've got a design book I need to get.|Sean, go check on our reservation.
{60210}{60252}They're gonna seat us right away.|Can't you wait after dinner.
{60254}{60308}Might be closed by then!|Come on, SJ.
{60310}{60372}- Please.|- I need some new magazines.
{60424}{60481}Michael, come on. Come on.
{60736}{60797}Collins! Collins!
{60827}{60863}Collins. Come on!|Your dad's already PO'ed.
{60865}{60928}- Lets' go. Come on.|- Over here.
{60962}{60995}Mike.
{61122}{61170}Remember this one, Mom?
{61172}{61241}You read it to us|like thousand times.
{61245}{61345}"And he gnashed his terrible teeth|and he roared his terrible roar."
{61360}{61397}I always liked this one.
{61399}{61461}Oh, Ferdinand...|Me too.
{61498}{61595}Michael, your mama ever read|either one of those books to you?
{61658}{61682}No?
{61714}{61750}How cute.
{61758}{61790}It was a good steak.
{61792}{61857}- Thank you, Daddy.|- Thank you for lovely dinner, Papa.
{61859}{61896}Here we go.
{62742}{62776}Michael?...
{62778}{62855}Who was that boy you were|talking to, at the restaurant?
{62857}{62893}Marcus.
{62920}{62977}Marcus. And he works there?
{62979}{63015}Yeah.
{63045}{63093}How do you know him?
{63126}{63170}He's my brother.
{63335}{63409}Well, we'd really like|to meet him someday.
{63435}{63493}Would that be okay with you?
{63500}{63558}I don't know where he stays.
{63562}{63626}When's the last time you saw him?
{63692}{63745}When I was little mebbe.
{63842}{63991}"Once upon a time in Spain, there was a|little bull and his name was Ferdinand.
{64027}{64105}All the other little bulls he lived with|would run and jump
{64107}{64167}and butt their heads together,
{64193}{64239}but not Ferdinand.
{64283}{64387}He liked to sit just quietly|and smell the flowers.
{64446}{64540}He had a favorite spot out in the pasture|under a cork tree.
{64577}{64630}It was his favorite tree
{64632}{64756}and he would sit in its shade all day|and smell the flowers."
{64769}{64824}- Good night.|- Good night.
{64916}{64952}What?
{64962}{65010}Why are you smiling?
{65019}{65106}I don't know. I'm just happy.|Really happy.
{65127}{65199}Does this happiness have anything|to do with Michael?
{65201}{65237}No.
{65262}{65331}It has everything to do with Michael.
{65431}{65471}Happy's good.
{65490}{65540}You know what I think we should do?
{65542}{65612}We should start a charity|for kids like Michael.
{65614}{65631}Okay.
{65633}{65693}- Maybe fund a program at Wingate.|- Sure.
{65695}{65760}Lord knows that school|could use a little color.
{65762}{65846}Michael's like a flying and milking|that place.
{65852}{65905}Are you listening to me?
{65976}{66151}I try to concentrate on one...|thing... at a time.
{66175}{66251}You knew I was multi-tasker|when you married me, right?
{66253}{66333}- I sure did.|- Alright. Okay. Let's check it.
{66438}{66532}Okay. Tuohy family.|Big smiles everyone!
{66561}{66643}And, one , two, three...
{66717}{66797}Michael! Michael come over here|and get in the next one.
{66799}{66875}Come on. Come on. Come over here.
{67002}{67078}Oh, come on. It's not like I'm gonna|put it on the Christmas card.
{67080}{67179}Okay, let's scootch in a little tighter.
{67184}{67222}That's good.
{67241}{67277}Really big smiles.
{67279}{67365}Okay, one, two three... say Rebels!
{67368}{67404}"Rebels"
{67483}{67613}{y:i}TV commentary
{67615}{67651}I got it.
{67673}{67732}- Who's winning?|- Tennessee.
{67747}{67795}- Who are they playing?|- Clemson.
{67797}{67856}Your mom roots against Tennessee|no matter who they're playing?
{67858}{67925}Oh, yes, I do. With gusto.
{67928}{67977}She can't stand Tennessee.
{67979}{68055}Collie-bell, I thought you were|going to your boyfriend's?
{68057}{68127}I thought of hanging around here today.
{68161}{68200}I like that.
{68204}{68271}Hey, baby. There's a coupla messages|on the machine but I didn't check 'em.
{68273}{68309}Alright.
{68334}{68418}{y:i}Hey, Sean, hey, Leigh Anne,|It's cousin Bobby. Happy New Years!
{68420}{68467}Listen, I've had about five cold ones...
{68469}{68557}- Of course she had. - So I'm...|I'm just gonna go ahead and ask...
{68559}{68639}Ya'll know there's a colored boy|in your Christmas Card?
{68713}{68742}What?
{68765}{68897}You just looked teeny-tiny next to him.|Right? Like Jessica Lange and King Kong.
{68924}{68987}Hey, does Michael get the family discount|at Taco Bell?
{68989}{69072}Because if he does Sean's gonna lose|a few stores.
{69079}{69108}He's a great kid.
{69110}{69189}Well, I say make it official|and just adopt him.
{69224}{69257}He's gonna be eighteen|in a few months.
{69259}{69339}Doesn't really make much sense|to legally adopt.
{69401}{69493}Leigh Anne, is this some|sort of white guilt thing?
{69508}{69562}What will your daddy say?
{69574}{69657}Umm... before or after he turns over|in his grave?
{69661}{69720}Daddy's been gone five years Elaine,
{69722}{69776}make matters worse you were|at the funeral.
{69778}{69859}Remember? You were Chanel|and that awful black hat.
{69861}{69906}Look, here's the deal.
{69908}{69981}I don't need y'all to approve|my choices, alright?
{69991}{70048}But I do ask you to respect them.
{70050}{70095}You've no idea what this boy's|been through.
{70097}{70163}And If this is going to be|some running diatribe
{70165}{70250}I can find an overpriced salad|a lot closer to home.
{70279}{70321}Leigh Anne, I'm so sorry.|We didn't intend to---
{70323}{70360}No. We didn't really.
{70362}{70440}I think, what you're doing is so great.
{70445}{70506}To open up your home... to him.
{70520}{70590}Honey, you're changing that boy's life.
{70593}{70621}No.
{70646}{70692}He's changing mine.
{70720}{70799}That's awesome for you,|but what about Collins?
{70822}{70849}What about Collins?
{70851}{70920}Aren't you worried, I mean,|even just a little?
{70922}{70977}He's a boy, a large, black boy,
{70979}{71038}sleeping under the same roof.
{71096}{71136}Shame on you.
{71248}{71288}I've got this.
{71337}{71390}Be honest with me, okay?
{71424}{71503}Is Michael being here making|you uncomfortable?
{71528}{71606}They're stupid kids,|who cares what they say.
{71613}{71643}What kids?
{71645}{71678}At school.
{71702}{71733}They're juvenile.
{71735}{71801}And what do they juvenile kids say?
{71812}{71874}It's really not worth repeating.
{71890}{71981}And don't worry about SJ;|he likes all the attention.
{71995}{72067}He introduces Michael|as his big brother.
{72159}{72227}- What about you?|- It's fine.
{72292}{72371}I mean, you can't just throw him|out on the street.
{72373}{72433}I can make other arrangements.
{72518}{72554}- Hi, Mike.|- Hi.
{72556}{72604}- Need a push?|-Yeah.
{72759}{72800}Higher, Mike! Higher!
{72893}{72929}Higher!
{73048}{73084}Higher!
{73185}{73246}Don't look down.|Don't look down!
{74057}{74115}- Where are you going?|- Collins?
{74407}{74465}Quit looking at me like that.
{74467}{74531}I mean, we study together at home.
{74935}{75047}You know how much those things weigh?|This kid's gonna make us all famous.
{75082}{75125}Easy, Bert, man.|It's only the spring
{75127}{75185}he hasn't even been through|his first practice yet.
{75187}{75230}No. He's a player.
{75300}{75339}Ready.
{75356}{75400}Get down, son.|Get down in your stands.
{75402}{75439}In your stands!
{75454}{75482}Go!
{75621}{75659}Mike! Son!
{75677}{75754}You fall off the block and then|you wanna shuck-shuck the blocker.
{75756}{75826}Right? Shuck it!|Alright? Let's go!
{75897}{75931}Papa?
{75962}{76004}How's he doing?
{76008}{76067}Doesn't quite have|the hang of it yet.
{76220}{76261}Hey, Mike. Son...
{76268}{76323}Shuck the blocker. Don't hold him!
{76405}{76485}No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No.
{76755}{76805}Balloons! There are balloons!
{76815}{76883}Guys, quit looking at the balloons.|Everybody.
{76887}{76961}Most kids from bad situations|can't wait to be violent
{76963}{77005}and that comes out on the field.
{77007}{77085}This kid, he acts like he doesn't want|to hit anyone.
{77087}{77131}He's Ferdinand the Bull.
{77133}{77183}- What?|- Nothing.
{77214}{77250}I thought sure he was gonna be a player.
{77252}{77323}I can't believe I used up my chiefs|to get him in school.
{77325}{77403}I thought you said it was|your Christian duty?
{77419}{77492}Look, Bert. He's never played before.
{77511}{77595}And he won't this fall if he doesn't|improve a lot before then.
{77597}{77648}Who xxx made him Bert bright?
{77666}{77706}Unbelievable!
{77742}{77786}Oh, God bless me.
{77798}{77836}This is your summer workout sheet.
{77838}{77913}Now, first it says to warm up|and get loose.
{77919}{77967}Go ahead, get loose.
{78029}{78061}Are you loose?
{78076}{78167}Okay, next is five one hundred yard runs|to stretch out your legs.
{78169}{78206}Let's go home,|play some video games.
{78307}{78347}You don't want to let|them down, do you?
{78349}{78366}Iono.
{78368}{78398}What about Dad and Mom?
{78400}{78470}'Cause you see, in our family|everyone's an athlete.
{78472}{78511}Dad was a basketball star,
{78513}{78567}Collins plays volleyball|and runs track.
{78569}{78629}And me, as you know, I do it all.
{78631}{78694}And Mom...|Mom was a cheerleader,
{78696}{78770}which doesn't exactly count|but don't tell her I said that.
{78772}{78804}- Okay?|- Okay.
{78806}{78834}Okay.
{78899}{78982}...fifty, fifty one,
{79013}{79088}fifty two, fifty three...
{79090}{79153}Come on and get it!|Go, go, go, go, go!
{79158}{79221}Come on. Five seconds left in the game!
{79255}{79311}Just like!|Just like!
{79316}{79385}High knees, high knees, high knees!|xxx baby.
{79392}{79428}Run like the wind!
{79465}{79507}Go, Michael, go!
{79519}{79590}...ninety eight, nine,
{79636}{79664}one hundred.
{79666}{79714}Move your feet! Move your feet!|Come on! Come on! Come on!
{79716}{79760}Go. There you go.
{79764}{79831}Get on the tackle!|Come on! Come on! Come on!
{79848}{79893}Come on, Michael!
{80474}{80499}Mrs. Tuohy?
{80501}{80586}I hear "Mrs. Tuohy" I look over my|shoulder for my mother-in-law.
{80588}{80671}Call me Leigh Anne or Mama|or almost anything else.
{80737}{80808}- Can you help me get something?|- What?
{80865}{80909}Driver's licence.
{80941}{81043}Why do you need a driver's licence|when you don't even have a car?
{81198}{81272}Michael, why do yo want|a driver's licence?
{81276}{81347}Something to carry.|With my name on it.
{81512}{81580}There's nobody named|Michael Oher in the system.
{81582}{81638}Another last name perhaps?
{81695}{81761}Look, I will sign something|that says he lives with us
{81763}{81850}and we'll pay for all the insurence;|whatever it takes, okay?
{81862}{81890}What's it gonna take?
{81892}{81959}- You wanna do what?!|- You heard me.
{81963}{82039}- Shouldn't we at least talk about this?|- What do you think we're doing?
{82041}{82096}And don't act like I'm going|behind your back.
{82098}{82187}I know you put us down as Michael's|medical contact at school.
{82189}{82262}There's a huge difference between|paying for broken arm
{82264}{82308}and being legally responsible|for someone.
{82310}{82356}I mean the kid we barly know.
{82358}{82436}That's another thing. We need|to find out more about his past.
{82438}{82486}He won't talk about it.|He's like an onion,
{82488}{82535}you have to peel him back|a layer at a time.
{82537}{82589}Not if you use a knife.
{82612}{82692}What if we took him to a child|psychologist or something?
{82694}{82755}- Do you really expect Big Mike---|- "Michael"
{82757}{82837}You really expect Michael to lie down|on a coach and talk about his childhood
{82839}{82870}like he's Woody Allen or something?
{82872}{82938}I mean, Michael's gift|is his ability to forget.
{82940}{83047}He's mad at no one and he really|didn't care what happened in the past.
{83055}{83094}You're right.
{83099}{83135}Excuse me?
{83138}{83175}"You're right?"
{83177}{83240}How'd those words taste|coming out of your mouth?
{83242}{83281}Like vinegar.
{83490}{83555}At least promise me you'll think about it.
{83557}{83593}Alright.
{83618}{83698}"Alright" you'll think about it or|"alright" we should do it?
{83700}{83750}Is there a difference?
{83809}{83913}Just tell Gerald to hold on the chiffonier|and I'll get by after while.
{83946}{84017}You don't...|I got to call you back. Bye.
{84081}{84117}Excuse me.
{84154}{84235}I'm not cutting, I'm just asking.|Let me tell you something, alright?
{84237}{84286}We've been sitting around here|for over an hour
{84288}{84329}and when i look around|and all I see
{84331}{84394}is people shooting the bull|and drinking coffee.
{84396}{84443}Who runs this place?
{84508}{84565}Well, I'd have it in shape in two days,|I can tell you that.
{84567}{84615}I'd bet you would.|How can I help you?
{84617}{84669}- Oh, he was first.|- No, you go ahead.
{84671}{84728}- I think I want to hear this|- Me too.
{84730}{84769}I do not appreciate|the attitude.
{84771}{84842}Ma'am,|now you can tell me what you want
{84848}{84901}or I'll make sure you wait all day.
{84903}{84949}Now how can I help you?
{84951}{84999}I'd like to become|a legal guardian.
{85001}{85050}Lord help that child.
{85140}{85241}There's very little on Michael.|Most of his files have been lost.
{85249}{85323}- What is in there?|- A few case notes.
{85332}{85443}This one describes an incident where|Officers forcibly removed Michael
{85445}{85512}from Denise Oher's care|when Michael was seven.
{85514}{85581}Quite a scene evidently.|They had to split up the kids.
{85583}{85617}And it's far from the worst.
{85619}{85668}Where is she? His mother?
{85670}{85776}Dunno, if you find her we got|a bunch more files we could add to.
{85801}{85881}- How many kids does she have?|- At least a dozen, probably.
{85883}{85940}If not more.|With her drug arrest record
{85942}{86005}my guess would be|she can't even remember.
{86015}{86057}May I see that?
{86162}{86224}So we'd need her permission, right?
{86226}{86277}No. Michael is a ward of the state.
{86279}{86356}Just apply and get a Judge|to sign off on it.
{86406}{86506}So you would just give him away|without even telling his mother?
{87071}{87106}Mrs. Oher?
{87189}{87224}Hi.
{87226}{87262}Mrs. Oher?
{87301}{87356}- You from the state?|- No.
{87384}{87518}My name is Leigh Anne Tuohy|and your son Michael lives with me.
{87553}{87594}And my family.
{87749}{87819}How's my boy? How's big Mike?
{87832}{87894}He's fine. He's doing really well.
{87923}{87981}We might have some wine|in the kitchen, if you...
{87983}{88038}Oh, no, no, no.|That's really kind.
{88046}{88096}When did you last see Michael?
{88127}{88163}I don't know.
{88179}{88254}How many foster kids you got|living with you?
{88283}{88379}Oh, I'm not a foster parent to Michael.|We were just helping him out.
{88389}{88468}- State don't pay you nothing?|- No.
{88479}{88555}And you feed him?|You buy him clothes, too?
{88562}{88644}Well, when I can find them in his size.
{88717}{88773}You a fine Christian lady.
{88783}{88819}Well I try to be.
{88870}{88930}This is all really nice|what you're doing,
{88932}{89014}but don't be surprised if one day|you wake up and he gone.
{89044}{89102}- What do you mean?|- He's a "runner."
{89124}{89210}That's what the state called him|after they took him from me.
{89252}{89309}Every foster home they sent him to,
{89329}{89410}he'd slip out the window at night|and come looking for me.
{89412}{89530}No matter where I was that boy would|come find me, take care of me.
{89581}{89647}I've had some health problems.
{89698}{89792}Mrs. Oher, was Michael born|under a different name?
{89817}{89903}Proctor. That was his Daddy's last name.
{89926}{89996}- Where is he?|- Ain't seen him since he left.
{90013}{90049}And when was that?
{90057}{90108}Week after was Mike born?
{90132}{90194}Do you have his birth certificate?
{90375}{90435}It's alright. I'll figure it out.
{90799}{90864}Mrs. Oher, you'll always|be Michael's Mama.
{90968}{91003}Would you like to see him?
{91005}{91073}No. Not this way.
{91152}{91187}It's Williams.
{91244}{91288}His last name's Williams.
{91344}{91413}Couldn't even remember|who the boy's father is.
{92130}{92198}The color is better, the graphic is bright.|It's awesome!
{92200}{92271}Michael, we have something|we'd like to ask you.
{92281}{92317}What?
{92339}{92381}Leigh Anne and I, we...
{92396}{92432}Well...
{92441}{92503}We'd like to become your legal guardians.
{92505}{92539}What's that mean?
{92541}{92610}What it means is, that we want to know
{92614}{92682}if you'd like to become|a part of this family?
{92906}{92956}I kinda thought I already was.
{93164}{93214}Well alright then.
{93411}{93446}Right here.
{93541}{93574}We got a couple of steps.
{93576}{93630}- Watch your big foot.|- One more.
{93651}{93700}One more. There we go.
{93738}{93786}Alright. Take off the belt.
{93891}{93957}Well, that's the one you want it,|didn't it?
{94005}{94080}Here. Here you go.|Go ahead. Take it for a ride. Go.
{94090}{94119}- Can I go too?|- Yeah.
{94121}{94166}Michael? Be careful.
{94168}{94216}xxx
{94283}{94364}- He wanted a truck?!|- Michael thinks he's a redneck.
{94370}{94406}Come on, Michael!
{94429}{94524}Okay. See, you're the ketchup, here|at Left Tackle. On the weakside.
{94526}{94577}The fist play is simple. "Gap."
{94644}{94744}Now, see, dishes means you're going|to block whoever is in front of you,
{94746}{94823}or on your inside shoulder if you're not|covered by a defender.
{94825}{94915}Now, I'll be the running back and you|show me what you're supposed to do.
{94917}{94953}Ready.... Hike!
{94962}{95024}You block him, you hit him,
{95026}{95106}quarterback will hand it off,|he gets the ball and...
{95111}{95176}Open lane to the end zone.|All there is to it.
{95178}{95222}What's going on here?!
{95228}{95268}Player Spice just scored.
{95270}{95340}We're going through the playbook.|Michael got move to offense.
{95342}{95410}Yeah. Well, when you're done, please,|put the players back in the spice cabinet.
{95412}{95456}- Thank you.|- No problem.
{95475}{95551}Oh, actually, Mom, we were|kinda waiting for you.
{95565}{95671}You see, the new Madden game came out|and me and Michael wanted to go get it.
{95675}{95714}I can't, baby. I've got a meeting|in ten minutes
{95716}{95751}But he can drive!
{95769}{95810}He can drive us.
{95861}{95922}Oh, yeah.|That's what I'm talking about.
{95924}{95978}- What do you know about this?|- I already know all about this!
{95980}{96035}- Alright, show me something.|- I'll tell you something, alright?
{96037}{96090}I'll start it. Follow my leads.
{96095}{96126}- Ready?|- Yes.

{97119}{97197}The borders have different width.|They've been altered.
{97199}{97265}We'll give you seventeen tops, alright?
{97270}{97308}Hello?
{97391}{97435}Hey, hey, ma'am.|Ma'am, we check it.
{97437}{97496}Those are my kids. Those are my kids!
{97555}{97587}Oh my God!
{97600}{97625}- It will be okay.|- Where are they?
{97627}{97661}I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry.|Oh my God!
{97663}{97705}- Michael, you okay?|- I'm fine. SJ!

{97997}{98035}- Mom?|- Yes, baby?
{98040}{98112}Do you think the blood will come|out of my shirt?
{98132}{98206}Yes, I think the blood will come|out of your shirt.
{98214}{98268}Ma'am, an airbag deploys|at 200 miles an hour.
{98270}{98309}Your son's too small to sit|in the front seat.
{98311}{98354}But he's okay, right?
{98359}{98391}Busted lip, bruised face.
{98393}{98440}Usually when someone his size|gets the airbag
{98442}{98498}it's fractured faces, a broken neck.
{98500}{98529}Maybe worse.
{98531}{98614}Like the air bag was coming at him|then changed direction.
{98617}{98677}Quiet defective or something like that.
{98679}{98727}Your son's very, very lucky.
{98731}{98809}No idea. I called the insurence.|He's fine. He's fine!
{98819}{98881}I'll talk to you later.|I got to go. Bye.
{98957}{99004}SJ's fine.
{99029}{99129}He is. He's actually enjoying all|the attention he's getting back there.
{99171}{99265}Hey, Michael. Could happen to anyone,|alright? It's not your fault.
{99296}{99334}Honey, look at me.
{99481}{99538}Michael, what happened to your arm?
{99568}{99621}I stopped it.
{100058}{100097}Let's go!
{100224}{100284}Oher! You've got a hundred pounds|on Collis
{100286}{100341}and you can't keep him out|of our backfield?!
{100343}{100413}Hold your block until the whistle blow.|Hold it!
{100415}{100451}Alright, let's go!
{100473}{100506}What's with the camera?
{100508}{100607}Michael always does better when he sees|what he's supposed to be doing.
{100745}{100827}- Holding ... Left tackle.|- Michael! Come on!
{100842}{100905}Oher? Come here, son.
{100943}{101041}You got to hold it. Hold it inside here,|between the tits. You got it?!
{101048}{101085}Would you look at me, son.
{101087}{101179}If you grab 'em outside here like this|without horse colour thing, you just did,
{101181}{101256}we're going to get flagged and|I'm gonna get pissed. You hear me?
{101258}{101300}Alright, let's go!
{101328}{101382}Baby, watch my stuff, alright?
{101397}{101429}Okay.
{101472}{101537}Well at least he'll look good|coming off the bus.
{101539}{101622}They'll be terrified 'til they realize|he's a marshmallow.
{101677}{101743}Looks like Tarzan, plays like Jane.
{101788}{101837}Gimme a minute, Bert.
{101843}{101878}We're in the middle of practice,|Leigh Anne!
{101880}{101922}You can thank me later.
{101941}{101967}Come.
{101984}{102016}Michael,
{102018}{102050}do you remember|when we first met
{102052}{102125}we went to that horrible part of town|to buy those dreadful clothes?
{102127}{102178}And I was a little bit scared|and you told me not to worry about,
{102180}{102224}because you had my back.|Do you remember that?
{102226}{102244}Yes, ma'am.
{102246}{102344}And If anyone tried to get to me,|you would have stopped them, alright?
{102346}{102391}And when you and SJ were|in that car wreck,
{102393}{102445}what did you do to that airbag?
{102462}{102511}- I stopped it.|- You stopped it.
{102513}{102556}You stopped it.
{102567}{102611}This team is your family, Michael.
{102613}{102666}You have to protect them|from those guys.
{102668}{102701}Okay? Listen.
{102760}{102782}Okay.
{102788}{102862}Tony here is your quarterback, alright?|You protect his blind side.
{102864}{102910}When you look at him,|you think of me.
{102912}{102974}How you had my back.|How you have his.
{102980}{103030}Okay? Alright. Tony, go back.
{103081}{103106}Alright.
{103119}{103162}Oomaloompah here is your tailback.
{103164}{103204}When you look at him,|you think of SJ,
{103206}{103253}how you never let anyone|or anything to hurt him.
{103255}{103291}You understand me?
{103301}{103341}Alright. Go back.
{103363}{103426}- You got it?|- What about Collins and Mr. Tuohy?
{103428}{103477}Fine. They can be on the team too.
{103479}{103543}Are you gonna protect|the family, Michael?

{123129}{123198}Hey, Coach.|We drove from Clemson, nine hours!
{123208}{123250}Coach Fulmer, it's a real honor.
{123252}{123316}Coach Cotton, my pleasure. I watched|your program you've done really well.
{123318}{123390}I don't think there is any question|that you'll be at the next level soon.
{123392}{123466}Oh, well, you know,|we do all we can, all we got.
{123494}{123551}Is that Michael?|Is that O'Hair?
{123558}{123587}It's Oher.
{123593}{123643}Like a paddle in a boat. Oher.
{123750}{123798}You think we might see some drills?
{123800}{123848}Perhaps... I think all the Coaches|would appreciate it.
{123850}{123901}- Yeah?|- Oh, yes, sir. You bet.
{123962}{124017}Listen up, fellas! New board drill!

{124320}{124357}On my whistle, men!
{124842}{124876}Wow!
{125030}{125059}Coach, thank you.
{125061}{125126}- Where are you going, Coach?|- Back to South Carolina.
{125128}{125205}You tell to Michael Oher,|if he can qualify with his grades...
{125207}{125232}Clemson wants him.
{125234}{125287}Yeah. Good luck with that, Brad!
{125300}{125349}Coach, you've done a great job|with this young man.
{125351}{125392}Oh, well he was little rough|when we first got him
{125394}{125464}but we, you know,|coached him up a little bit.
{125719}{125750}Hello, mom.
{125752}{125812}Did you know that to be eligible|for a Division One scholarship
{125814}{125886}Michael's gonna need|to make it a 2.5 GPA?
{125908}{125920}Really?
{125922}{126032}His ACT is low and I don't see him doing|any better if he retakes it right there.
{126034}{126116}- What's his GPA now?|- 1.76.
{126133}{126185}Oh, that's not too bad, when you|consider where he started.
{126187}{126246}He's gonna make it all A's this year.
{126260}{126341}I'm serious.|And that might not even be enough.
{126349}{126399}So he goes to Junior College?
{126410}{126472}Most inner city kids that go to JC|drop out in the first year.
{126474}{126530}His shot at the pros would go|out the window.
{126532}{126615}Pros? Are we even sure|he's gonna get college offers?
{126691}{126739}{y:i}Michael, Nick Saban from LSU.|(Louisiana State University)
{126741}{126807}{y:i}I'm looking forward to you're coming|down and visit us sometime.
{126809}{126882}{y:i}Gready. I'm Lou Holtz form|South Carolina. I'm call...
{126884}{126981}{y:i}We're very interested in having Michael|over to Knoxville for a visit.
{126997}{127071}- Phil Fulmer, from Tennessee?|- There's twenty more among there.
{127073}{127137}And these things right here.|Fifty of 'em.
{127140}{127170}Any of those from Ole Miss?
{127172}{127249}No, they're not gonna start recruiting|until they hire a another coach.
{127251}{127332}Does make any difference|unless Michael makes his grades.
{127392}{127440}So, what are we going to do?
{127453}{127538}I understand you applied for|a teaching position at Wingate?
{127558}{127612}I won't religious enough for 'em.
{127617}{127749}I'm a spiritual person, Mrs. Tuohy, but|I have certain, shall we say... doubts.
{127776}{127832}Oh, I appreciate your honesty, Miss Sue.
{127834}{127911}- What's the situation with Michael?|- He needs to be better in school.
{127913}{127965}Obviously. Why the big push?
{127972}{128021}Well, he's in line for|football scholarship
{128023}{128069}if he gets his grades up.
{128077}{128147}- Is he considering Ole Miss?|- He'd better be.
{128188}{128275}- I'd love to work with him.|- Well, when'd you like to start?
{128304}{128395}Ms. Tuohy... Umm... There's something|you should know about me.
{128402}{128486}I don't usually tell many people, but|it's something I feel should be aware of
{128488}{128525}before you hire me.
{128578}{128615}What is it?
{128624}{128667}I 'm a Democrat.
{128710}{128746}Okay.
{128876}{128931}- I don't understand it.|- Yet.
{128938}{128986}You don't understand it yet.
{129039}{129100}- How big is your head, Michael?|- Big.
{129120}{129156}And what's in there?
{129158}{129193}- A brain.|- A brain.
{129195}{129234}It's full of knowledge -
{129236}{129286}like a file cabinet with maps;
{129303}{129363}and shortcuts for figuring things out.
{129368}{129409}You'll get there, Michael Oher
{129411}{129489}because I'm to help you use those maps|and reach your destination.
{129491}{129551}Like Sacagawea helped|Lewis and Clark.
{129559}{129587}Sacagawea?
{129592}{129671}We'll get to that.|And the history books have it wrong,
{129678}{129753}All you need to know|is I'll get you there.
{129779}{129822}Do you believe me?
{129890}{129936}You trust me, Michael?
{129985}{130018}Yes, Miss Sue.
{130077}{130113}Try it again.
{130145}{130193}Now, what's the next one?|Read that to me.
{130195}{130275}Hey, what is it?|As first, we have to find the constant.
{130286}{130332}Now, where is the constant?
{130337}{130388}Good. See?
{130394}{130481}Who'd thought we'd have a black son|before we knew a Democrat.
{130518}{130591}- Doorbell!|- I got a guest.
{130662}{130696}Coach, how are you? Come in.

{130901}{130970}- And you must be Leigh Anne.|- That would be me, Coach Saban.
{130972}{131010}- Nice to meet you.|- Me too.
{131012}{131037}Please, call me Nick.
{131039}{131128}With an incredible home.|The windsor valances are a nice touch.
{131138}{131232}Oh, thank you. You obviously|have an excellent taste.
{131234}{131329}Well we appreciate the quality.|And recognize it when we see it.
{131367}{131412}Michael, why don't you come over here|and say hello to Coach Saban.
{131414}{131451}Hello, Michael. Nick Saban.
{131453}{131489}- Nice to meet you.|- Nice to meet you.
{131491}{131544}- And you must be SJ.|- That's me.
{131546}{131636}Michael, why don't you and Nick|go into the living room to talk?
{131638}{131661}Can SJ come?
{131663}{131716}Absolutely.|We'll recruit the both of you.
{131718}{131751}Alright.
{131811}{131862}I find him extremely handsome.
{131868}{131911}Yeah, I'm right here, Leigh Anne.
{131913}{131945}Yeah, I know.
{131960}{132029}So Michael, we'd like to|get you down to LSU for visit.
{132031}{132083}We've got a great thing going there|right now,
{132085}{132167}you have an opportunity to be|successful as a person, as a student,
{132169}{132276}and an opportunity to be a part of the next|National Championship team with LSU.
{132278}{132350}So what do you say?|You'd like to commit to a visit?
{132352}{132398}- Can I ask a question?|- Sure.
{132400}{132448}My brother and I are very close.
{132450}{132543}And so... I'm very afraid that|if he goes off to school,
{132554}{132600}I might not get to see him.
{132602}{132639}- So ...|- Go on.
{132646}{132739}I guess I was just wondering how much|access I'd have to him.
{132746}{132803}Well, SJ, you'd have total access|to Michael.
{132805}{132884}But better than that, in his first game|at Tiger stadium,
{132886}{132953}we would like for you to lead|the team out of the tunnel.
{132955}{133023}- What do you think about that?|- Sounds good.
{133367}{133394}Come on in!
{133396}{133473}Gready. I'm Lou Holtz.|The University of South Carolina.
{133475}{133545}Leigh Anne Tuohy. Nice to meet you.|Come on in. Michael!
{133547}{133601}Hello. I'm Tommy Tuberville.|Albany University.
{133603}{133657}Leigh Anne Tuohy. Nice to meet you.|Michael!
{133659}{133705}Howdy, Houston Nutt.|University of Arkansas.
{133707}{133745}Leigh Anne Tuohy.|Very nice to meet you.
{133747}{133811}- Ole Miss Cup, huh?|- Michael!
{133859}{133910}Oh, come on. You know this.
{133917}{133953}It's logical.
{134232}{134295}I guarantee you come to the|University of South Carolina
{134297}{134351}will be the smartest decision|you've ever made.
{134353}{134410}We want you, we need you,|but the other thing is,
{134412}{134448}Mike, you need us.
{134558}{134633}Knoxville is a tremendous place|to live and...
{134641}{134708}I know there's lions, there's tigers,|there's bears...
{134710}{134763}Hey, there's only one razorback|in the world.
{134765}{134859}...and not only that, you'd look great|in Gamecock Red!
{134863}{134890}What's in if for me?
{134892}{134977}SJ, I'd get you a hawkhat,|and for whole family a hawkhat.
{134979}{135038}Are you telling me,|that's the best you can do?
{135040}{135094}SJ, you remind me of me as a boy.
{135101}{135148}Coach, help me, help you.
{135151}{135245}I can get you a Gamecock headdress.|And with real feathers.
{135452}{135486}What you got for me, Phil?
{135488}{135555}SJ, I've been thinking a lot of|about that and one of the things
{135557}{135636}that think will be special for both|of us is we'll walk arm in arm
{135638}{135696}to center of Union Stadium|at the first ball game,
{135698}{135742}and we'll do the coin toss together.
{135744}{135767}How's that sound?
{135769}{135824}Coach Fulmer, a pleasure doing|a business with you
{135826}{135896}My pleasure, SJ.|Could be sure, buddy.
{136143}{136186}Congratulations on gettin' hired.
{136188}{136253}Thank yew, Ma'am.|Ole Miss is my dream job.
{136267}{136333}You're coming a little late to the party|but we're diehard Rebels
{136335}{136381}so I'm gonna give you|a frickin' road map.
{136383}{136413}- Alright?|- Got it.
{136415}{136491}LSU is out. Everybody knows|Saban's going to the NFL.
{136496}{136562}I don't wanna name names, but on|Michael's first two recruitment trips
{136564}{136599}somebody took him to the tittybar.
{136601}{136645}- That's terrible.|- Tell me about it.
{136647}{136702}He'll have nightmares about for a weeks.|So when he comes to visit
{136704}{136766}I want you to feed him Italian -|he likes Fettucine Alfredo -
{136768}{136849}and I want you to take him to a movie -|not Chainsaw Massacre
{136851}{136932}because he'll just cover his eyes -|and get him to bed by ten.
{136934}{136961}- You got it?|- Yes'm.
{136963}{137017}- Alright.|- What about Tennessee?
{137035}{137095}It breaks my heart but they're still|in the hunt.
{137097}{137141}Fulmer made SJ a sweet deal.
{137143}{137209}I heard the kid can really|pepper the gumbo.
{137211}{137251}He's his daddy's boy.
{137259}{137292}- You ready?|- Lets' do it.
{137294}{137321}Alright.
{137325}{137380}Mike, do you like to barbecue?|I tell you what, Mike.
{137382}{137440}You can go to the gas station|and get best barbecue,
{137442}{137477}you've ever got in your life.
{137479}{137541}It's a wonderful place to live,|fried catfishes,
{137543}{137583}all the good food|that we love to eat
{137621}{137676}you'd have to be aware, Mike.|I promise.
{137678}{137738}And for you, SJ,|this is what I can do.
{137742}{137790}At Ole Miss we have the Grove|by the stadium.
{137792}{137875}We walk it before every game,|in front of thousands of people.
{137877}{137935}It is a sacrad ritual. And I'm in front.
{137937}{137986}Seen it a thousand times.
{137989}{138027}Ever seen it from the front|of the line?
{138029}{138073}Next year, you and me;|leading the team.
{138075}{138163}Tennessee offered to let me run|on the field and flip the coin.
{138246}{138304}I'll throw in a sideline pass.
{138542}{138592}Have you decided yet, Michael?
{138594}{138635}No, Miss Sue.
{138658}{138715}But you like Tennessee?
{138746}{138784}It's a good school.
{138796}{138837}Not at academic level of Ole Miss,
{138839}{138910}but they have an outstanding|science department.
{138940}{138993}You know what they're famous for?
{139006}{139054}They work with the FBI
{139062}{139149}to study the effects of the soil|on decomposing body parts.
{139162}{139197}What's that mean?
{139205}{139286}Well when they find a body, the police|want to know how long it's been dead.
{139288}{139358}So the fine fox at Tennessee|help them out.
{139384}{139435}They have a lot of body parts.
{139454}{139602}Arms and legs and hands -|form hospitals and medical schools.
{139684}{139741}And you know where they store them?
{139824}{139881}Right underneath the football field.
{139927}{140030}So, while it's fine and dandy,|there're 100,000 fans cheering for you,
{140039}{140136}the bodies, you should be worried about|are right underneath the turf.
{140151}{140221}Set to poke up through the ground|and grab you.
{140345}{140415}But it's your decision where you wanna|play ball.
{140417}{140464}Don't let me influence you.
{141163}{141237}All the other teachers are on board,|I don't know, what your problem is.
{141239}{141261}I'm sorry.
{141263}{141340}I will not give a student a grade|he, or she, doesn't deserve.
{141342}{141407}Well, Michael needs a B.
{141425}{141497}What is he have to do to "deserve" that?
{141529}{141605}Right now is Michael doing C minus,|D plus work.
{141613}{141668}His best chance at improving|is with the written essay
{141670}{141704}at the end of the year.
{141706}{141763}It counts a third of his grade.
{141790}{141837}Well that's it. We're sunk.
{141880}{141953}Why don't you write about|"Great Expectations"?
{141959}{142003}You're a lot like Pip.
{142008}{142133}I mean he was poor, he was an orphan|and someone kind of found him.
{142139}{142197}You should be able to relate to that.
{142288}{142358}Fine, let's go through the reading list.
{142360}{142426}But you're gonna have to pick one, Michael.
{142440}{142471}"Pygmalion"...
{142547}{142638}"A Tale of Two Cities".....|"The Charge of the Light Brigade"...
{142640}{142716}"Half a league, half a league,|half a league onward"
{142729}{142769}I love that one.
{142777}{142815}He loves it.
{142872}{142948}Why don't you do this|and I'll watch basketball?
{143044}{143077}Okay.
{143164}{143237}"All in the Valley of Death rode|the six hundred."
{143271}{143371}They named LSU's stadium Death Valley|because of this story.
{143391}{143475}Alfred, Lord Tennyson has writing|about LSU Ole Miss.
{143479}{143541}- You're kidding?|- No. It's a great story.
{143543}{143579}It's a poem.
{143600}{143648}"Forward the Light Brigade!"
{143653}{143691}It's like the offense.
{143693}{143745}"Charge for the guns he said."
{143751}{143790}That's the end zone.
{143793}{143850}"Into the Valley of Death rode|the six hundred."
{143852}{143899}"Forward the Light Brigade!
{143904}{143956}Was there a man dismay'd?
{143960}{144032}Not tho' the soldier knew|someone had blundered."
{144048}{144090}Someone made a mistake?
{144097}{144182}Yeah, their leader, their coach.
{144241}{144328}But why would they go ahead|if they knew he messed up?
{144403}{144504}"Theirs not to make reply,|theirs not to reason why,
{144542}{144590}theirs but to do and die:
{144618}{144688}Into the Valley of Death rode|the six hundred."
{144758}{144816}They're all gonna die, aren't they?
{144852}{144877}Yeah.
{144964}{145018}That's really, really sad.
{145105}{145186}I think you just found something|to write about, Michael.
{145565}{145620}{y:i}Courage is a hard thing to figure.
{145625}{145715}{y:i}You can have courage based|on a dumb idea or mistake,
{145726}{145779}{y:i}but you're not supposed|to question adults,
{145781}{145839}{y:i}or your coach|or your teacher
{145844}{145892}{y:i}because they make the rules.
{145907}{145945}{y:i}Maybe they know best
{145957}{146005}{y:i}but maybe they don't.
{146022}{146096}{y:i}It all depends on who you are,|where you come from.
{146124}{146193}{y:i}Didn't at least one of the six hundred|guys think about giving up.
{146195}{146248}{y:i}and joining with the other side?
{146253}{146329}{y:i}I mean, Valley of Death|that's pretty salty stuff.
{146403}{146454}{y:i}That's why courage it's tricky.
{146471}{146541}{y:i}Should you always do|what others tell you to do?
{146570}{146645}{y:i}Sometimes you might not even know|why you're doing something.
{146647}{146705}{y:i}I mean any fool can have courage.
{146731}{146829}{y:i}But honor, that's the real reason|you either do something or you don't.
{146840}{146912}{y:i}It's who you are and maybe|who you want to be.
{146945}{146998}{y:i}If you die trying for|something important
{147000}{147057}{y:i}then you have both|honor and courage
{147063}{147112}{y:i}and that's pretty good.
{147123}{147179}{y:i}I think that's what the writer|was saying.
{147181}{147258}{y:i}That you should hope for courage|and try for honor.
{147277}{147379}{y:i}And maybe even pray that the people|telling you what to do have some, too.
{147509}{147552}Kevin Lynn.
{147668}{147710}- Good job.|- Excuse me.
{147770}{147822}{y:i}Matthew Nicols.
{147859}{147901}2.52.
{147932}{148002}Michael's final GPA.|Got it off Paul's computer.
{148004}{148036}{y:i}Jamie North.
{148039}{148085}He did it, Sean. He did it!
{148104}{148181}Baby, you've been broken to|the principal's computer?
{148224}{148263}Michael Oher.
{148437}{148506}Where in the world did you find|a baby picture of Michael?
{148508}{148585}Scanned it off an Internet ad|for a toddler boutique.
{148730}{148775}Congratulations, Mike.
{149166}{149208}Michael, our greetings.
{149285}{149322}Way to go, bro!
{149335}{149397}Alright, that's enough.|Young man...
{149419}{149468}I think I need a proper hug.
{149576}{149646}Alright. You're gonna be staying|in Deaton Hall - where is it?
{149648}{149715}109. It's right there.|And you're gonna be on a meal plan
{149717}{149773}so you're gonna be eating all the way|here in Johnson Commons. Right there.
{149775}{149836}Johnson Commons has all you|can eat self-serve ice cream.
{149838}{149865}As much as you want?
{149867}{149934}Yes, that's how Mama put|on her freshman ten.
{149977}{150001}Stop it!
{150072}{150102}Hello?
{150152}{150185}This is Mrs. Tuohy.
{150187}{150236}He just want ask you a couple|of questions,  Michael.
{150238}{150282}You have nothing to hide.
{150313}{150352}Ms. Tuohy? Mr. Oher?
{150357}{150402}My name is Jocelyn Granger,|and I'm the Assistant Director
{150404}{150446}of Enforcement for the NCAA.
{150448}{150496}Please, call me Leigh Anne.
{150568}{150608}So, let's do this. Shall we?
{150610}{150706}Ms. Tuohy, if you wouldn't mind|I'd prefer to speak with Michael alone.
{150708}{150774}- And how long is that gonna take?|- Awhile.
{150833}{150901}Go, Mike. Okay? Go.
{150990}{151080}Michael? Michael! I'll be waiting|for you in the lobby, alright?
{151189}{151275}I don't know, Sean. I just have|a bad feeling about this one.
{151283}{151348}This woman is tough, tough...|Hold on.
{151369}{151408}Hey.
{151429}{151481}The client wants what?
{151495}{151572}Were you aware that Coach Cotton|is accepting a job at Ole Miss?
{151574}{151596}No.
{151598}{151678}And that this job offer came after|you signed with them?
{151697}{151761}Sean Tuohy, your legal guardian|went to Ole Miss.
{151763}{151800}He played basketball.
{151802}{151862}And Mrs. Tuohy went to Ole Miss as well.
{151864}{151905}She was a cheerleader.
{151907}{151968}Is this safe to say that Ole Miss|is their favorite school?
{151970}{152060}Did they like any other Universities?|What about, say Tennessee?
{152067}{152118}No. They can't stand Tennessee.
{152155}{152202}- And your tutor...|- Miss Sue.
{152204}{152282}Miss Sue.|Miss Sue is an Ole Miss grad, too.
{152325}{152404}Miss Sue ever tried to persuade you|to attend Ole Miss?
{152530}{152607}Did you know that the Tuohys make|generous donations to Ole Miss?
{152609}{152673}That even Miss Sue makes donations?
{152680}{152732}That the Tuohys, they have|a condo in Oxford
{152734}{152809}so they can attend as many|athletic events as possible?
{152811}{152928}That, in fact, Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy|are by our definition... "boosters."
{152992}{153028}Mr. Oher.
{153043}{153076}Mr. Oher?
{153093}{153163}Do you understand...|Do you know, why am I here?
{153189}{153233}To... investigate.
{153235}{153282}Yes. To investigate.
{153306}{153398}I'm here to investigate your odd...|predicament.
{153424}{153498}Do you find it odd?|Your predicament?
{153555}{153585}Michael?...
{153612}{153643}Iono.
{153685}{153725}Can I... can I leave now?
{153727}{153765}No. You can't.
{153805}{153855}- What do you want, ma'am?|- I want the facts!
{153857}{153898}- I need the truth.|- I didn't lie!
{153900}{154000}- And I want to know what you think|about all this. - THINK ABOUT WHAT?!
{154203}{154329}The NCAA fears that with your recruitment|a door might be opened -
{154352}{154400}that boosters from lots|of schools in the south
{154402}{154461}will become legal guardians for|young athletes without means
{154463}{154521}and funnel them to their Alma Maters.
{154543}{154622}I'm not saying I believe it|and I'm not saying I don't,
{154626}{154670}but there're many people|involved with this case
{154672}{154739}who would argue that Tuohys|they took you in,
{154751}{154802}- they clothes you, they fed you,|- No.
{154804}{154850}- they paid for your private education,|- No.
{154852}{154884}- they bought you a car,|- No!
{154886}{154924}- and paid for your tutor,|- No.
{154926}{154990}all as part of a plan to insure|that you play football
{154992}{155048}for the University of Mississippi.
{155467}{155529}Michael! We're not finished.
{155549}{155609}It's not available. Just like I told you|three months ago.
{155611}{155665}So why don't we go with the canvas.
{155667}{155747}The low napa, it's a beautiful---|Oh, I'll call you back. Bye.
{155749}{155794}Michael. So what happened?
{155810}{155869}- Why'd you do it?|- What?
{155876}{155935}All along you wanted me|to go to Ole Miss.
{155937}{155990}Of course, I did.|We love Ole Miss!
{155992}{156018}Why did you do this for me?
{156020}{156056}- What?|- Everything!
{156058}{156111}Was it for you or was it for me?
{156115}{156187}Was it so I would go to school|where you wanted?!
{156190}{156244}Was it so i would do what you wanted?!
{156246}{156309}- Michael, no...|- That's what she thinks.
{156321}{156351}Is she right?
{156364}{156418}Michael, honey, I need for you|please, listen to me, alright?
{156420}{156468}Don't you dare to lie to me.
{156543}{156581}I'm not stupid!
{156589}{156619}Michael?!
{156621}{156659}Michael, of course,|you're not stupid.
{156661}{156700}Michael?!|Come on.
{156808}{156852}I should have followed him.
{156854}{156917}You had no way of knowing|he'd disappear.
{156974}{157015}Was he right?
{157035}{157079}What he said about us?
{157083}{157116}Leigh Anne, be reasonable.
{157118}{157173}We gave clothes to a boy|who had one pair of shorts.
{157175}{157216}We gave him a bed.
{157223}{157299}To hell with the NCAA,|I'd do it again tomorrow.
{157304}{157355}What about all the rest of it -
{157368}{157454}all the stuff we did to make sure|that he got a scholarship?
{157473}{157526}A scholarship at Ole Miss.
{157535}{157590}He could go whenever he wanted,|he knew that.
{157592}{157652}Oh, did he?|Did you ask him?
{157669}{157727}'Cause I sure as I know I never did.
{157783}{157812}Hey.
{157830}{157859}Come here.
{158263}{158395}Am I a good person?|Not a joke. Not rhetorical.
{158467}{158533}You're the best person I know.
{158590}{158651}Everything you do, you do for others.
{158716}{158759}And why is that?
{158827}{158870}I have not a clue.
{158885}{158986}But you obviously get some|sort of sick satisfaction out of it.
{159134}{159179}- Sean...|- Yeah?
{159207}{159255}What if he never comes back?
{159423}{159459}Oh, shit!
{159509}{159601}Big Mike?|Hey, get your ass in here, man.
{159605}{159642}I'm looking for my Moms.
{159644}{159703}Your Mama?|Yeah, I seen Dee Dee around.
{159727}{159773}As a matter of fact...
{159787}{159871}Oh, yeah. She usually stop by for a taste|around this time.
{159877}{159934}But I tell you what.|Why don't you just come inside
{159936}{160022}I'll get you a forty and we're|gonna chop it up like real fo,
{160028}{160070}just 'til she get here.
{160123}{160186}Come on, man.|Nobody gonna bite you, man.
{160404}{160492}Hey! Big Mike! Man, go down|xxx and have a seat.
{160506}{160545}Yeah, bitch!
{160547}{160599}Hey, baby, gimme a couple of cold beers|from the refrigerator!
{160601}{160634}Sit down, man. Big Mike.
{160636}{160688}- What?|- I'm so glad to see you.
{160697}{160764}Yeah. You lookin' good.|Too, you lookin' fit.
{160773}{160826}I heard you playin' little ball.
{160838}{160935}But you know that rich kid football|ain't like the public school league.
{160937}{161006}Niggers packing knives in their socks.
{161029}{161083}Hey, I played little ball myself.
{161088}{161143}Back in the day, you know that, alright?
{161145}{161169}Yeah, I heard.
{161171}{161236}A quarterback. Up there at MLK.

{165520}{165584}Yeah, but you tell him,|I'll be seeing him around.
{165586}{165629}Or he gonna get this.
{165634}{165673}So Michael was here?
{165680}{165756}Last night. He come by here.|Sneaked me then run off.

{166296}{166379}I'm in a prayer group with the D.A.,|I'm a member of the NRA
{166381}{166423}and I'm always packing.
{166542}{166621}What you got in there, a .22?|A Saturday Night Special?
{166674}{166745}And it shoots just fine|all the other days, too.
{167351}{167398}- Michael?!|- Mama?...
{168065}{168134}You think the police is gonna come|and get me?
{168145}{168197}I'd imagine the last thing|they want at Hurt Village
{168199}{168253}is bunch of cops snooping around.
{168341}{168463}I swore I'd never ask this, but|how'd you get out of there, Michael?
{168526}{168600}When I was little and something|awful was happening
{168615}{168682}my Mama would tell me to close my eyes.
{168687}{168786}She was tryin' to keep me from seeing|her do drugs or other bad things.
{168798}{168869}And then when she was finished|or the bad things were over
{168871}{168983}she'd say, "now when I count|to three, you open your eyes
{169009}{169079}and the past is gone,|the world is a good place,
{169084}{169141}and it's all gonna be okay."
{169203}{169242}You closed your eyes.
{169323}{169428}You know, when I was driving all over|Kingdom Come looking for you
{169434}{169490}I kept thinking about one thing.
{169524}{169564}Ferdinand the bull.
{169645}{169726}I know I should have asked this|a long time ago, Michael.
{169758}{169816}Do you even wanna play football?
{169838}{169889}I mean do you even like it?
{169920}{169994}- I'm pretty good at it.|- Yeah, you are.
{170069}{170114}Sean and I have been talking and...
{170116}{170197}Michael, if you're gonna accept|the football scholarship
{170223}{170280}we think it should be to Tennessee.
{170348}{170469}And I promise that I will be at|every game cheering for you.
{170493}{170545}- Every game?|- Every game.
{170587}{170667}But I will not wear that gaudy orange.|I will not.
{170669}{170747}It is not in my color wheel|and I'm not gonna wear it.
{170807}{170864}So you want me to go to Tennessee?
{170897}{170967}I want you to do|whatever you want.
{170984}{171051}It is your decision, Michael.|It's your life.
{171099}{171152}What if I want to flip burgers?
{171237}{171307}It's your decision; it's your life.
{171376}{171404}Okay.
{171450}{171481}Okay, what?
{171541}{171593}I'm sorry I left the other day.
{171596}{171672}- You were pretty upset.|- You ask a lot of questions.
{171674}{171712}I'm just trying to get|to the bottom of this.
{171714}{171792}But all questions you asked|were about why everybody else
{171794}{171840}wanted me to go to Ole Miss.
{171842}{171863}Okay...
{171865}{171936}Not once did you ask|why did I want to go there.
{171982}{172090}Alright, fine, Michael...|Why do you want to go to Ole Miss?
{172107}{172173}Because it's where my family|goes to school.
{172196}{172258}It's were they've always gone to school.
{172431}{172480}College is going to be different|experience for you, Michael.
{172482}{172512}SJ, stop it.
{172514}{172569}- There are lots of distractions.|- Have a fun.
{172571}{172677}There's gonna be some nimrod in the dorm|who wants to play video games all night,
{172679}{172724}or goof on the internet.
{172726}{172751}Just have fun.
{172753}{172825}And you will spend a lot of time|at practice, which means...
{172827}{172896}which means you have to be very|dedicated to your studies, alright?
{172898}{172935}SJ, if you don't stop it right---
{172937}{172955}- Come here.|- No.
{172957}{172996}Relax, Mama.
{173003}{173042}I just got back from the library
{173044}{173104}I reserved a private cubicle|for the semester.
{173106}{173165}Here's your class schedule|and our study hall hours.
{173167}{173248}Now, if y'all don't mind I'm gonna|go move into my new apartment.
{173250}{173309}- Thank you, Miss Sue.|- "Thank you, Miss Sue"
{173311}{173353}Yeah, yeah, yeah....

{173699}{173763}Michael Oher, you listen to me, alright?
{173778}{173852}I want you to enjoy yourself, but if|you get a girl pregnant out of wedlock
{173854}{173954}I'll crawl in the car, drive up here|to Oxford and cut off your penis.
{173965}{174001}She means it.
{174026}{174066}- Yes ma'am.|- Alright
{174146}{174245}Now, 78's gonna be a parking lot.|So we should be going. Or everyone...
{174253}{174305}Say the goodbyes, alright?|Here.
{174311}{174324}Bye, baby.
{174326}{174383}- Thank you, Mama.|- You're welcome.
{174597}{174644}Why'd she always do that?
{174655}{174754}She's an onion. Michael. You have|to peel her back one layer at a time.
{174823}{174858}I'll be back.
{175131}{175162}What?
{175319}{175356}What, Michael?
{175361}{175401}I need a proper hug.
{175966}{176050}{y:i}I read a story the other day|about a boy from the projects.
{176070}{176139}{y:i}No daddy, in and out of foster care.
{176166}{176243}{y:i}He'd been killed in a|gang fight at Hurt Village.
{176268}{176365}{y:i}In the last paragraph they talked about|his superb athletic skills
{176380}{176421}{y:i}and how different his life|might have been
{176423}{176500}{y:i}if he hadn't fallen behind|and dropped out of school.
{176505}{176571}{y:i}He was twenty-one years old|the day he died.
{176596}{176636}{y:i}It was his birthday.
{176779}{176827}{y:i}That could have been anyone.
{176834}{176893}{y:i}It could have been my son, Michael.
{176919}{176955}{y:i}But it wasn't.
{177032}{177097}{y:i}And I suppose I have God|to thank for that.
{177177}{177232}{y:i}God and Lawrence Taylor.
{177520}{177555}{y:i}One Mississippi.
{178448}{178516}The New England Patriots have traded|the twenty third pick
{178518}{178561}to the Baltimore Ravens.
{178585}{178663}And with the twenty third|pick in 2009 NFL draft
