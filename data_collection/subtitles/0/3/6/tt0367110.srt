1
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,790
Good afternoon and welcome to the
Phase ll Press Conference of the

2
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:05,624
upcoming mission for the
Global Precipitation Measurement.

3
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:09,915
To discuss the mission we have
with us John Stockton

4
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:15,207
GPM Project Formulation Manager
from NASA HQ.

5
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,165
Mohan Bhargav

6
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:21,040
Project Manager and Spacecraft
Mission Director from GODDARD.

7
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,999
- Over to you John.
- Thank you George.

8
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:27,999
The Office of Management and Budget
released the President's 2004

9
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:33,457
fiscal year budget plan in early February
flagging off the GPM Launch.

10
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:38,124
We have in the Formulation phase
of GPM taken steps to reduce risks

11
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:41,457
to ensure a mission
confirmation review.

12
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:46,124
That's where Mohan Bhargava,
our Project Manager comes in.

13
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:50,249
Thank you John.
Good afternoon everybody.

14
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:55,374
Before l come to Phase ll , a quick update
on the recently concluded Phase l .

15
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:59,499
ln Phase l we focused on the
Definition of Mission Scope,

16
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:03,124
Systematic Measurement Approach
and Technology Roadmaps.

17
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,290
Will you roll the tape please?
Thank you.

18
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:11,499
The core satellite is designed
like a TRMM Spacecraft.

19
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:17,415
lt'll be launched in non-sun-sync
orbit at an inclination of 65-degrees

20
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,457
and an altitude of 400 kms.

21
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:24,915
The constellation satellites would be
pre-existing operational, experimental &

22
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:29,749
dedicated satellites,
with PMW radiometers.

23
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,082
They would operate both in
non-sun-synch and synch orbits

24
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:37,499
at an altitude of 600-900 kms.

25
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,374
You are welcome to
throw any questions.

26
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:55,749
What are the objectives of the Global
Precipitation Measurement programme?

27
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,624
- Last question.
- ls this budget justified?

28
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,790
Globally, there is a danger of
water recession in the near future.

29
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:12,499
lt will not be unreal to imagine that
in the 21st century, cities like

30
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:20,915
Beijing, Amman, New Delhi, Santiago,
Jakarta, Mexico City, Lima

31
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:27,415
and many others, will drink up
their surrounding waters and perish.

32
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:34,957
Water is going to be rare. ls it not a
reason enough to justify any budget?

33
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,332
Are there any more questions?

34
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,665
- Thank you for being here.
- Thank you very much.

35
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,332
l've never seen John Stockton
smile so much.

36
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:01,915
He is really very happy with us.

37
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:06,499
The press conference went off well.
And your presentation excellent!

38
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,957
This is a quantum leap for us.

39
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:15,290
Well, we can now let our hair down
now that phase l is finally over.

40
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,999
Hey, you've been very quiet.
What's the matter?

41
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:34,624
l want to get a cup of coffee.
Would you like some?

42
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,457
- Make me a strong one.
- Sure

43
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,624
Two new messages,

44
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,749
Hi Mohan. This is Paul tried
calling you at work and your cell

45
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,915
you seem to be in a meeting,
call me back.

46
00:05:57,083 --> 00:06:00,832
Good afternoon Mr. Bhargava, this is
Steven Carter from the BClS...

47
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:06,957
...your request for citizenship has been
accepted. Please call me on Monday. Bye.

48
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:19,290
Congratulations! Your request for
citizenship has been accepted.

49
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:26,624
- You seem lost.
- Not really.

50
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,540
l get it. Work pressures are
stressing you out

51
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,540
and then you have no other interests...
No pubbing, no partying!

52
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:41,415
Take my advice,
you should get married!

53
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,540
You need a life partner.

54
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,624
Like they say... Happiness
only doubles when it is shared!

55
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:51,915
lt changed My life!

56
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,457
No Vinod, that's not it.

57
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,415
Then what is it?

58
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:05,832
What's the matter?

59
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,624
Today is the death anniversary
of my parents.

60
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,915
Oh! l'm sorry.

61
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:16,707
No, lt's okay.

62
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:25,165
l still vividly remember that l was in my
last year of University in Pennsylvania

63
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,624
...when l received the news
of their car accident!

64
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:34,207
Now l understand why
you've been so low all day.

65
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,249
You know Vinod...

66
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,540
There's something else,
which has been

67
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,374
pricking my conscience
these last few months.

68
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:52,207
Do you remember Kaveriamma?

69
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:57,374
Kaveriamma? Your old
maid servant, right?

70
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:01,707
Please don't call her a maidservant.
She was like a mother to me!

71
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:07,582
l'm sorry. l had no idea.
What about her?

72
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,124
As you know,
l was the only child.

73
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:20,999
My parents brought me up with a lot of
love, they provided me with everything.

74
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:27,999
But along with them, Kaveriamma too
had a special place in my life.

75
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,832
My mother would
make my breakfast,

76
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,665
while Kaveriamma would feed me.

77
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:41,540
My parents tucked me into bed,
while Kaveriamma sang me a lullaby.

78
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:49,332
From the age of two to seventeen
she looked after me completely.

79
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:57,374
You could say Kaveriamma was
like a second mother to me

80
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:04,249
So when was the last time
you met her?

81
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:11,999
At my parent's funeral.

82
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,415
l remember crying like a child
in Kaveriamma's arms.

83
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,415
lt was a very tough time for me.

84
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:26,290
Then l came back here and
began to find a footing in life.

85
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:31,207
Kaveriamma would often write me letters,
and l would send her replies as well.

86
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:40,415
But later, l got so completely immersed in
my work, that l just lost touch.

87
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,165
All this is so out of the blue Mohan.

88
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,915
why did you suddenly
think of her today?

89
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,624
lt's not sudden, Vinod.

90
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,665
l've been thinking about her
since the past few months.

91
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,915
l've been having recurring
nightmares of her being...

92
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:05,582
...old, feeble, and helpless.

93
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,749
Vinod, l have blundered.

94
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,457
l now feel very guilty
that l have neglected her...

95
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,249
...and haven't been able to
look after her.

96
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,749
l had become selfish Vinod.

97
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:33,207
She is the only thread who can
string the memories of my parents.

98
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:48,915
l was thinking of going to Delhi...
and bringing her here.

99
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,749
Absolutely! Brilliant idea!

100
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:55,832
But l don't think John will consent.

101
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,332
There can't be a better time for you
to ask for a vacation than now,

102
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:05,665
We are 28 weeks away from
the GPM launch. John won't refuse.

103
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,207
- You think so?
- Yeah sure.

104
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:15,332
Promise to bring him back an
elephant or something.

105
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,915
Yeah sure

106
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,332
Thank you very much.

107
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:41,124
So its on the outmost importance
to get the time pressure on the

108
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,832
stabilization unit.

109
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,332
Thank you very much gentlemen.

110
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,582
- Excuse me John.
- Sure, tell me.

111
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:55,207
l have a request for two weeks off.
Need to go to lndia, is it possible?

112
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:58,165
ls everything ok back home?

113
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,999
Oh yeah everything is allright.
Just a pending matter.

114
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,332
When do you have to leave?

115
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,499
Actually as soon as possible.

116
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,915
28 weeks to launch?

117
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:11,207
You realize you have to delegate
Some of this to others.

118
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:14,290
Oh yes yes l'll have a detailed
meeting with the team and

119
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,415
l'll be in constant touch
with Vinod from there.

120
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,749
Alright then, have a good trip.

121
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,040
Thank you very much John.

122
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:29,290
Amazing... John agreed very quickly.
l should have asked for a vacation myself.

123
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,790
Thank God you didn't. lf you had,
he would have cancelled mine too.

124
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:29,374
May l clear your tray please?
Can l get you anything else?

125
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:30,624
No thank you.

126
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,457
This is your captain here.
Good morning everyone.

127
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,082
We have now started our decent

128
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,749
And in a short time we'll be landing

129
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,540
at the lndira Gandhi
lnternational Airport in delhi.

130
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:20,874
Hope you had a comfortable flight
Thank you for flying Air lndia.

131
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,374
Your attention please.

132
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:13,165
Announcing the arrival of flight
Al-112 from New-York

133
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,499
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

134
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:22,915
- How was the flight?
- Connecting flight was delayed. Rest ok!

135
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:26,415
- Did you get anything for me?
- Yeah, everything's for you, kid!

136
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:32,915
So Kaveriamma... is she still living
in an Old age Home?

137
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,624
Did you speak with her?

138
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:39,290
No, l want to surprise her!

139
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:43,124
She'll be so glad to see you.
l'm sure she'll have forgotten me.

140
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,415
Obviously!

141
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:12,582
- Excuse me.
- Yes? May l help you?

142
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,207
l've come to meet Kaveriamma.

143
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,290
- Kaveriamma?
- Yes.

144
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,665
Kaveri oh yes! She doesn't
live with us any longer.

145
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:27,165
- Doesn't live here?
- She stayed with us for about a year...

146
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:30,874
...till a woman came looking for her.
And then, Kaveri left with her.

147
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,040
But where did she go?

148
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:38,290
Just a minute,
l'll have to check the register.

149
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:50,874
Bharati ji, this gentleman is
looking for Kaveri.

150
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,374
Do you know where
is she now?

151
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,540
Bharatiji used to share
the room with Kaveri.

152
00:16:56,875 --> 00:17:00,374
l remember her mentioning
a village before leaving.

153
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,915
Now what was it...?

154
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,999
- Charanpur.
- That's right, Charanpur.

155
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,124
- Where is this Charanpur?
- Never heard of it.

156
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,624
We'll find out.

157
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,790
Kaveri was a good woman.

158
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,165
We all miss her.

159
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:24,832
Here's the address.

160
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,124
Thank you!

161
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,249
Kaveri is very fortunate.

162
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:38,124
There was someone who came
for her then, and now once again.

163
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:42,124
Otherwise who cares
for old ones like us?

164
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:46,749
Come on.

165
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:56,124
Excuse me.

166
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,707
Here's the map.
You'll find Charanpur in here.

167
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,249
- That'll be 150 rupees.
- That's ok. Don't pay me.

168
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,957
Do me a favor. Watch the counter
for me while l nip to the bank.

169
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:11,207
- Get me a loan too!
- Sure, you'll manage the counter, right?

170
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,082
l'll just sit behind.

171
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,457
- That's good.
- Come back soon.

172
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,624
Excuse me you've no respect?

173
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:29,290
What happened?

174
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:33,832
You can see l am picking up books,
and still you're walking all over them.

175
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,749
l did not mean to.

176
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:39,374
Look, books are a source
of knowledge and culture...

177
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,290
and if you don't know how to respect
them, you shouldn't be here.

178
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:47,332
- Well l'm sorry.
- Thanks.

179
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,332
l'm sorry, l was just
looking at this map.

180
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,290
You want to buy these books?

181
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,499
No! l want to sell them!!

182
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,999
- Oh stupid question, l'm sorry.
- No l'm sorry.

183
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:41,665
- Actually l'm just a little irritated.
- No, l saw what happened.

184
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:43,540
You dealt with the man right.

185
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:46,415
Some people just don't have
the basic etiquette.

186
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:52,957
Oh yeah... l'll do this for you.
Lots of books.

187
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,165
- l will need a...
- Over there.

188
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,415
Yes, thank you.

189
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,332
That's 13 books of mathematics into 17...

190
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:13,499
...is equal to 221 + 22 Language
books into 12 is equal to...

191
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:21,082
Four-Eighty five.

192
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:29,665
That's 8 geography books into
19 is 152 plus 485 is...

193
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:30,957
Six-Thirty Seven.

194
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:38,415
Really 637? Thanks.

195
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:47,624
And these 8 note books at 113
and the total is...

196
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,165
Seven Fifty.

197
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:50,999
Must be right!

198
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:58,665
750 it is.
Your... maths is pretty good!

199
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,415
Actually, l should be
giving you a concession.

200
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,499
You selected the books,
you did the totalling...

201
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,915
you should be in my chair!

202
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,415
Then give me a concession?

203
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:15,165
Sorry l can't!

204
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:20,165
Actually my name is Mohan Bhargav.
l'm Rahul's friend...

205
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:25,082
...he's the owner of this shop,
he's just gone to the bank...

206
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:28,957
...he was broke you see...
needed to get some money

207
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,624
l'm just filling in for him.

208
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:32,540
Oh!

209
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:36,082
l'll just pack this for you
l just need...

210
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:37,249
Bags.

211
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,624
l have been looking
for Charanpur in this map

212
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,040
lt's a small little village.

213
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,707
Have you heard of it?

214
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,374
Yes, l know where it is.

215
00:21:56,625 --> 00:22:01,540
Go down National Highway No. 6 for
110 kms till you reach Charoti.

216
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,290
Take a left from there.

217
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,790
Then keep going for 80 kms till
you reach Azamgarh.

218
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:13,249
From there 20 kms on a dirt track,
you'll reach Charanpur.

219
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:19,499
Wow! Your geography seems
pretty good as well!

220
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:24,749
Here you...

221
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:28,915
Hello! Excuse me.

222
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,249
Please look after the counter. Hello.

223
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:50,124
What happened?
You sick of the job already?

224
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:55,040
No, a girl came in, bought a lot of
books... but left without her change.

225
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,540
Hey! Not bad!

226
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,165
You made a profit for the company on the
very first day! You've got the job!

227
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:02,124
She was amazing!

228
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:04,749
She even gave me directions
to Charanpur!

229
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,415
Great, where is it?

230
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:09,082
About 200 kms from here.

231
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:13,499
Spare me Mohan. Don't expect me to
leave the store and drive you there.

232
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:17,874
No worries!
l'll need a car though.

233
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:22,665
- Take mine.
- No, no. Could l get a caravan?

234
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:24,790
Caravan? What for?

235
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:28,540
Don't know the conditions l'll have
to face in the village.

236
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,874
Ok, ok Mr. NRl
(Non-Resident lndian)

237
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:35,207
You'll have your caravan.
Don't worry.

238
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:28,874
Can you tell me which of these
paths will lead to Charanpur?

239
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:30,915
You have strayed from the path.

240
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,665
Really?
l've been following directions...

241
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:39,082
l must have taken a wrong
turn somewhere.

242
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:41,332
lt was your destiny to make
this mistake.

243
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:44,915
Charanpur is pretty far from here.
l'm headed in that direction.

244
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:50,707
lf you want,
l can show you the right path!

245
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:48,415
Go on, O traveller!
O traveller! Go on!

246
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:52,665
How beautiful is this world

247
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:57,374
Forget thy troubles all
Behold! The beds of flowers enthrall

248
00:25:57,583 --> 00:26:01,540
Heed thee vibrant world's call

249
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:23,124
Wow!

250
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:27,540
Encore!

251
00:26:28,916 --> 00:26:29,749
Sing.

252
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:35,457
This path now bids me:

253
00:26:35,916 --> 00:26:40,165
Somewhere, someone's
waiting for thee!'

254
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:44,874
This path now bids me:

255
00:26:45,041 --> 00:26:49,415
Somewhere, someone's
waiting for thee!'

256
00:26:56,291 --> 00:27:00,540
Why doth my heart impatient be?
Who longeth to meet me?

257
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:05,082
Perhaps, in the narrowing compass
What l'd cherished is coming to pass

258
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:09,540
Go on, O traveller!
O traveller! Go on!

259
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:13,624
Life's a car; Time's the wheel

260
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:18,874
There's the river of tears for sure
And a garden of joys too, secure.

261
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:22,624
O brother, all these stare
intently upon thy path

262
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:27,624
Go on, O traveller!
O traveller! Go on!

263
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:31,749
How beautiful is this world

264
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:36,749
Forget thy troubles all
Behold! The beds of flowers enthrall

265
00:27:36,916 --> 00:27:41,207
Heed thee vibrant world's call

266
00:27:59,625 --> 00:28:03,665
Wherever l cast my eye
upon these paths

267
00:28:04,125 --> 00:28:07,874
Colours stream in my glance

268
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:12,957
The breeze is cool, the shade cool too

269
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:17,790
Far, over there, l wonder whose
hamlet stands

270
00:28:19,916 --> 00:28:24,082
Ah! How didst the rain clouds amass?

271
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:28,249
That my heart was brought
to such a pass

272
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:32,665
- What dream have l seen?
- That every dream doth true appear,

273
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:37,249
Kindling fire in my body
lf thy heart's path thou traverseth

274
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:41,749
Thou shallst pick pearl from
The oyster every moment

275
00:28:41,916 --> 00:28:46,415
Only if thou couldst always
heed thy heart

276
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:50,999
Go on, O traveller!
O traveller! Go on!

277
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:55,040
How beautiful is this world

278
00:28:55,750 --> 00:29:00,040
Forget thy troubles all
Behold! The beds of flowers enthrall

279
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:04,540
Heed thee vibrant world's call

280
00:29:31,958 --> 00:29:35,874
The heart experienceth such ease

281
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:40,582
As though the burden upon the
shoulder hath dropped off

282
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:45,332
As though innocence of
childhood hath returned

283
00:29:45,583 --> 00:30:03,457
As though at longest last in
River Ganga hast one had bath

284
00:30:03,666 --> 00:30:07,915
The heart purged as it were
Every bond at large

285
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:11,915
l find the life sanctified now

286
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:16,332
There's love in my living,
a song upon the lips

287
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:20,915
This is verily the triumph of
thy life, O traveller!

288
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:25,332
Whichever direction thou goest,
Love alone thou squander

289
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:30,124
You light a million lamps,
O traveller!

290
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:34,915
Go on, O traveller!
O traveller! Go on!

291
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:38,832
Who is it that haileth me

292
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:43,957
The river, hill, lakes and streams,
the woods and trees

293
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:48,290
Who's it that signals from these

294
00:31:06,166 --> 00:31:11,040
Go on, O traveller

295
00:31:13,291 --> 00:31:18,124
How beautiful is this world

296
00:32:02,958 --> 00:32:03,874
Excuse me.

297
00:32:04,833 --> 00:32:07,124
Do you know where Kaveriji lives?

298
00:32:07,916 --> 00:32:10,624
Hey Chikku!
Take this man to Kaveriji.

299
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:33,540
- Sorry!
- Watch it!

300
00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:58,040
Ammaaaaaa! Ammaaaaaa!
(Mother! Mother!)

301
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:04,040
Ammaaaaaa!

302
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:06,790
Wait a while.

303
00:33:06,958 --> 00:33:11,915
She needs to be massaged like this
in the morning and evening, Maithili!

304
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:14,207
She'll cry a little, but ignore it.

305
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:16,749
Understood?
Now say.

306
00:33:16,916 --> 00:33:20,290
Amma, someone has come
to meet you in a big car.

307
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,749
A very big car?

308
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:24,957
Come on, now!
lt's parked outside.

309
00:33:25,166 --> 00:33:26,040
l am coming.

310
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:32,665
Chikku, hope this isn't
one of your pranks!

311
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:33,665
Look at that.

312
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:38,999
lt's big; isn't it?

313
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:48,040
What's going on?

314
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:51,540
Huh, who is this?

315
00:33:52,541 --> 00:33:54,124
Go on take a guess!

316
00:33:54,583 --> 00:33:58,999
l can't. Come on, who is this?
Let go of me!

317
00:33:59,208 --> 00:34:01,874
Atkan batkan dahi chatokan,
(Lord Krishna's childhood couplet)

318
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,624
Tu Yashoda, main hoon...?
(Lord Krishna's childhood couplet)

319
00:34:07,125 --> 00:34:08,124
Mohannnn!

320
00:34:12,041 --> 00:34:12,749
Mohan!

321
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:14,665
Kaveriamma.

322
00:34:15,875 --> 00:34:19,832
Mohan... it's you, it's really you!

323
00:34:27,916 --> 00:34:28,999
l can't believe my eyes!

324
00:34:31,458 --> 00:34:34,915
Do you know who this is?
This is Mohan.

325
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:37,749
The one l keep talking
to you about.

326
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:39,207
Come

327
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:46,624
Stop! Wait right here.
Do not step inside. l'll be back.

328
00:35:33,916 --> 00:35:35,415
Now you can come in!

329
00:35:38,916 --> 00:35:40,540
- Kaveriamma.
- Yes?

330
00:35:42,458 --> 00:35:44,207
Oh... what are you doing?

331
00:35:56,541 --> 00:36:03,915
l can't express how happy
l am to see you Mohan.

332
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:21,582
Let Gita come.
l'll tell her l've won the bet.

333
00:36:22,458 --> 00:36:24,832
Bet? What bet?

334
00:36:26,291 --> 00:36:31,790
Gita always said
"Your Mohan has forgotten you, Amma."

335
00:36:31,958 --> 00:36:32,749
Really?

336
00:36:32,916 --> 00:36:37,540
But l would always retort:
"No, he will come to meet me."

337
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:40,415
And then we had a bet!

338
00:36:40,916 --> 00:36:44,749
lf you did come, she would have to
treat me to an ice cream.

339
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:47,165
lce cream? Kaveriamma!

340
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:49,790
- Why?
- Because you haven't changed a bit!

341
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,957
You haven't lost your
appetite for ice-creams!

342
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:53,082
Why not?

343
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:57,082
Why not? Are ice creams meant only
for kids? Can't we oldies enjoy it?

344
00:36:57,291 --> 00:36:58,249
Sit!

345
00:36:58,458 --> 00:37:04,207
All right, you win. And by the way,
who says you're old?

346
00:37:08,041 --> 00:37:11,999
So... who is this Gita?

347
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:15,790
Don't you remember?
You often played with her as a child.

348
00:37:15,958 --> 00:37:19,332
She used to visit our Delhi house
with her mother.

349
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:20,957
Gita...

350
00:37:21,583 --> 00:37:25,332
Are you referring to that
'Gitlee' by any chance?

351
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:29,457
Yes!
You called her that.

352
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:32,624
And this is Nandan
Gita's younger brother.

353
00:37:32,958 --> 00:37:37,957
- But we lovingly call him Chikku.
- Chikku! Hey Chikku!

354
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:43,832
He has faked a tummy ache today
so that he can miss school.

355
00:37:55,291 --> 00:37:56,874
- How old are you?
- Eight.

356
00:37:57,166 --> 00:37:58,249
Which school do you go to?

357
00:37:58,458 --> 00:38:00,332
l study in Navjeevan Paathshala.

358
00:38:00,541 --> 00:38:04,665
My roll number is 6
and l am in the fourth standard!

359
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:06,207
The motto of our school is

360
00:38:06,416 --> 00:38:09,207
Books are a source of knowledge
and knowledge is strength.

361
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:12,374
Your school seems to be a good one.

362
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:15,915
- Why haven't you gone today?
- l had a stomach ache.

363
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:16,915
Really?

364
00:38:18,166 --> 00:38:19,999
Was the pain here?
Or here?

365
00:38:21,708 --> 00:38:24,374
- Would you like to see my school?
- No, not now.

366
00:38:24,583 --> 00:38:28,165
- l want to talk to Amma.
- No! Let's go right now.

367
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:30,082
All right Chikku.

368
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:34,165
Mohan, why don't you
go visit the school with Chikku.

369
00:38:34,375 --> 00:38:37,124
You can meet Gita as well.
She teaches there.

370
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:39,749
Ok, but l thought Chikku had a
stomach ache!

371
00:38:39,916 --> 00:38:43,790
Ache? Oh yes!
lt was there, but it just went away!

372
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,040
Let's go to my school now!

373
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,874
That's Uncle Postman!

374
00:38:59,916 --> 00:39:01,749
Not just postman my dear

375
00:39:01,916 --> 00:39:04,165
...l'm the plough and the bull, field
and seed, crop and the grains.

376
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:05,749
l am everything here!

377
00:39:05,916 --> 00:39:09,540
l sort the letters, seal them
and distribute them as well!

378
00:39:10,041 --> 00:39:13,124
When on my bicycle, l'm the Postman
and in my chair, Postmaster.

379
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:18,165
The name is Nivaaran Dayal Shrivastava.
How can l help you?

380
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:20,707
Can l call America from here?

381
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:25,540
There is no lSD, here but you can get
connected through Mizwa village.

382
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:30,915
By the way, there is no bank, no bond,
and no registry in this village.

383
00:39:31,666 --> 00:39:34,790
l apologise, for the trouble
earlier today.

384
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:40,249
- That's ok. You live abroad, right?
- Yes.

385
00:39:41,916 --> 00:39:43,957
l too happen to know some English.

386
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:48,415
What can l do for you?

387
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:49,790
Very good.

388
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:58,124
Look Mohanbhaiyya this is my school!

389
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:01,249
l'm impressed, Chikku!

390
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:07,832
lt was in 1942 that

391
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,374
the slogans of the 'Quit lndia Movement'
were first heard in Bombay.

392
00:40:11,833 --> 00:40:16,665
From Bombay to Lahore,
Lahore to Peshawari...

393
00:40:16,958 --> 00:40:21,082
the lndian revolutionaries and the
British soldiers were locked in conflict!

394
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:25,832
Blows were dealt in succession,
bullets were whizzing and ricocheting.

395
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,207
But through all of it our protests were
on, and we never raised our hands!

396
00:40:30,458 --> 00:40:32,374
l got hit by a bullet on
the shoulder as well.

397
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:36,207
Then they arrested us and
threw us in prison

398
00:40:36,541 --> 00:40:39,957
...we kept protesting-lnquilab zindabad!
(Long live the Revolution)

399
00:40:40,166 --> 00:40:43,290
- Dadaji, did you have a beard then?
- l wish l did!

400
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:47,374
Then the bullet would have got stuck
in my beard and got lost!

401
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:54,582
l... am... going!

402
00:40:54,875 --> 00:41:00,415
We... both are... going!

403
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:05,540
We... all are... going!

404
00:41:05,916 --> 00:41:08,499
Very good! Kamala, now you repeat...

405
00:41:10,416 --> 00:41:12,499
l... am... going!

406
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:16,874
lt's you!

407
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:21,207
l must have misunderstood your
directions and got lost.

408
00:41:22,041 --> 00:41:25,207
Excuse me! This is a school
and a class is in progress.

409
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:26,499
l'm sorry.

410
00:41:26,791 --> 00:41:30,582
Mohan bhaiyya this is Gita didi.
And didi didi, this is Mohan bhayya...

411
00:41:30,791 --> 00:41:33,707
- He has come from Aamkarica!
- Not Aamkarica, Chikku! America.

412
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:37,040
Chikku, what are you doing here?
l thought you had a stomach ache!

413
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:40,790
Amma asked me to show
Mohan bhaiyya the school so l just...

414
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:43,165
So you are Gita! Remember me?

415
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:45,707
l used to call you 'Gitlee'
when we were kids.

416
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:52,957
The children are
supposed to be studying.

417
00:41:53,458 --> 00:41:54,499
l'm sorry.

418
00:41:59,291 --> 00:42:02,624
Now l understand.
Mathematics, Geography...

419
00:42:04,458 --> 00:42:06,582
Oh yeah, by the way...

420
00:42:06,875 --> 00:42:10,790
...you forgot your 50 rupees
at the bookshop!

421
00:42:13,083 --> 00:42:15,082
Thank you, will you please go now?

422
00:42:15,291 --> 00:42:18,290
Yes. l'm very sorry.

423
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:25,165
l... am... going!

424
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:26,290
Very good.

425
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:38,374
What's this?

426
00:42:38,833 --> 00:42:41,665
This is a foot massager, that'll take
care of your aching feet.

427
00:42:44,833 --> 00:42:47,082
- There is no electricity at the moment.
- Why?

428
00:42:47,333 --> 00:42:51,874
- We have power failures quite often.
- Oh, when will it resume?

429
00:42:52,041 --> 00:42:55,957
Nothing can be said for sure.
This happens 3-4 times a week.

430
00:42:58,916 --> 00:42:59,957
Who are they?

431
00:43:00,875 --> 00:43:03,624
Gita's parents Shanta and Jagmohanji...

432
00:43:03,833 --> 00:43:06,790
who started the school in Charanpur.

433
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:12,415
When Chikku was only five,
Jagmohanji passed away.

434
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:16,874
Gita was studying in a college
in Delhi at that time.

435
00:43:17,666 --> 00:43:20,624
As soon as she graduated,
she came here...

436
00:43:20,833 --> 00:43:24,332
...to help her mother with the
running of the school.

437
00:43:24,791 --> 00:43:27,957
But Shanta's health was on the decline,

438
00:43:29,083 --> 00:43:31,749
till a point when she sent Gita to the
Old Age Home to fetch me.

439
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:37,957
Before dying, Shanta entrusted
the upkeep of Gita and Chikku to me.

440
00:43:57,666 --> 00:43:58,790
Thanks.

441
00:44:00,625 --> 00:44:04,582
- Why did it take you so long, Gita?
- l had to correct a few test papers.

442
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,999
Thought l may as well finish it there.

443
00:44:08,166 --> 00:44:12,374
Didi, didi, look what
Mohanbhaiyya got for me!

444
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:15,290
Guess what l'm going to
cook for you Mohan?

445
00:44:15,541 --> 00:44:16,457
Very nice.

446
00:44:16,875 --> 00:44:20,165
Your favorite tadka daal,
aloo ki sabzi and kheer.

447
00:44:20,583 --> 00:44:21,582
Wow!

448
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:26,832
Gita! Now you will have to treat me
to an ice-cream.

449
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,457
You lost the bet.

450
00:44:35,458 --> 00:44:39,165
Oh Kaveriamma, l've missed your food.

451
00:44:39,416 --> 00:44:41,124
The kheer was especially good.

452
00:44:42,041 --> 00:44:44,332
l knew you would like it.

453
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:45,999
Enough about me.

454
00:44:47,291 --> 00:44:51,707
Now tell us about yourself...and America.

455
00:44:53,166 --> 00:44:55,790
Everything's fine in America.

456
00:44:56,208 --> 00:44:58,957
l have all the comforts.
l have all that l could ask for.

457
00:45:00,333 --> 00:45:02,290
l'm glad to hear that.

458
00:45:03,041 --> 00:45:05,707
And how is your nasha going on?
(nasha - Hindi slang for drugs)

459
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:07,790
Nasha?

460
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:11,749
Why? Have you quit?

461
00:45:15,666 --> 00:45:16,582
Nasha?

462
00:45:16,875 --> 00:45:21,415
NASA? NASA??

463
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:22,707
That's what l meant.

464
00:45:22,875 --> 00:45:26,665
My work at nasha... l mean NASA
is going very well.

465
00:45:29,583 --> 00:45:30,957
So, you're an astronaut?

466
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,874
No.

467
00:45:36,125 --> 00:45:40,790
l'm a Project Manager for the
Global Precipitation Measurement! GPM.

468
00:45:42,541 --> 00:45:45,290
Global Precipitation Measurement.

469
00:45:47,166 --> 00:45:47,999
Very good.

470
00:45:48,208 --> 00:45:51,957
Look at this Mohan bhaiyya!

471
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:56,999
Wow! Very good. You are a great artist!

472
00:45:57,666 --> 00:46:01,582
Chikku, you bunked school today.
And, you have to catch up with studies.

473
00:46:03,375 --> 00:46:05,582
- Good night Chikku!
- Say good night!

474
00:46:14,833 --> 00:46:16,415
l owe you an apology.

475
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,290
Apology? For what?

476
00:46:21,833 --> 00:46:22,749
l'm sorry...

477
00:46:23,708 --> 00:46:25,832
...that l wasn't there to take care of you

478
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,040
What are you talking about?

479
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:29,540
Let me talk Kaveriamma!

480
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,582
l'm sorry... that l wasn't there to
take care of you.

481
00:46:35,625 --> 00:46:39,415
l'm sorry... that l was not there
when you needed me most.

482
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,249
l'm sorry... that you had to go
to an Old Age Home.

483
00:46:47,791 --> 00:46:49,290
Not another word now!

484
00:46:50,416 --> 00:46:51,290
Son...

485
00:46:53,375 --> 00:46:55,582
...these are all matters of destiny.

486
00:46:58,708 --> 00:47:00,207
l have everything...

487
00:47:00,791 --> 00:47:01,790
Everything, but you!

488
00:47:02,791 --> 00:47:04,624
l miss you very much Kaveriamma.

489
00:47:05,458 --> 00:47:06,540
Will you come with me?

490
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:08,332
Where?

491
00:47:09,041 --> 00:47:12,624
America.

492
00:47:12,833 --> 00:47:15,165
No, l'm fine here!

493
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,957
Just come with me, you'll love it there.

494
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:23,874
You'll get a lot of rest and peace.
lt's a much better life there.

495
00:47:27,458 --> 00:47:29,374
Let me think about this.

496
00:47:33,458 --> 00:47:35,624
Come on now...

497
00:47:39,208 --> 00:47:40,499
You should go to sleep here.

498
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,790
Here?

499
00:47:43,958 --> 00:47:47,499
lf you don't mind,
l will sleep in the caravan.

500
00:47:47,708 --> 00:47:49,457
Now what new machine is this?

501
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:50,832
One that puts you to sleep!

502
00:47:51,875 --> 00:47:52,999
Something like that!

503
00:47:54,166 --> 00:48:02,874
- Good Night.
- Good Night.

504
00:49:46,833 --> 00:49:47,624
Yes?

505
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:50,665
Yesss??

506
00:49:52,541 --> 00:49:53,749
Sir, l am Mela Ram!

507
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:56,915
Hello. What do you want?

508
00:49:57,458 --> 00:49:59,207
Sir, l have brought you breakfast.

509
00:49:59,416 --> 00:50:01,999
- Please try my breakfast.
- Breakfast? Not now.

510
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:05,332
Sir please, l made it especially for you.

511
00:50:05,541 --> 00:50:07,999
l am a very good cook.

512
00:50:08,208 --> 00:50:10,499
Got it... means understood!

513
00:50:22,125 --> 00:50:25,582
- You're a good cook! l'm impressed.
- Thank you sir.

514
00:50:31,375 --> 00:50:33,790
You have come from America sir?

515
00:50:36,083 --> 00:50:37,582
l have a question sir.

516
00:50:38,166 --> 00:50:40,374
ln America, are there a lot of highways?

517
00:50:41,083 --> 00:50:44,082
Yes, there are. They are
called freeways there.

518
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:45,624
Got it!

519
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:46,874
Means l understood.

520
00:50:49,041 --> 00:50:50,499
One more question, sir.

521
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:53,499
Be comfortable.

522
00:50:54,416 --> 00:50:56,957
Do they have Dhabas on these freeways?
(dhaba - an lndian fast food joint)

523
00:50:57,625 --> 00:50:58,624
- Dhaba?
- Yes.

524
00:50:59,875 --> 00:51:02,082
Sort of. Why?

525
00:51:03,375 --> 00:51:04,707
What do you think?

526
00:51:04,875 --> 00:51:09,290
Will an lndian dhaba
work on those freeways?

527
00:51:11,708 --> 00:51:13,874
- l think it'll work!
- Will it work?

528
00:51:15,375 --> 00:51:21,207
l think maybe... thanks for the dhaba,
l mean breakfast!

529
00:51:21,875 --> 00:51:24,290
Now if you'll excuse me,
l've got to get ready!

530
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:25,290
Of course sir.

531
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,499
l'll meet you again sir.

532
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,457
Thank you, Thelaram.

533
00:51:30,083 --> 00:51:32,290
- Sir it's Mela Ram!
- Sorry, Mela Ram.

534
00:51:33,875 --> 00:51:35,082
Sir last question.

535
00:51:37,208 --> 00:51:39,290
Sir l will give you a very good offer sir.

536
00:51:39,875 --> 00:51:41,707
We'll open a dhaba in partnership.

537
00:51:41,875 --> 00:51:45,290
l will give you 50%
half share of all the money l make

538
00:51:45,958 --> 00:51:47,832
l have even thought of a name
for this dhaba.

539
00:51:48,875 --> 00:51:49,707
lt will be called...

540
00:51:50,208 --> 00:51:53,915
- ...Mela Ram Dhaba. Ok?
- Ok.

541
00:51:54,416 --> 00:51:56,999
- Happy?
- Very happy.

542
00:51:57,208 --> 00:51:58,290
lt's a deal sir.

543
00:51:59,708 --> 00:52:03,207
Jai Ramji ki!
(Lord Ram be praised)!

544
00:52:31,625 --> 00:52:33,290
So this is your caravan!

545
00:52:33,708 --> 00:52:36,082
Not mine. lt belongs to a
friend of Rahul's.

546
00:52:38,083 --> 00:52:40,207
lt's nice! lsn't it Gita?

547
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:43,582
Chikku was right.

548
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:46,290
Really, this car is exactly like a house.

549
00:53:08,291 --> 00:53:09,082
There's a kitchen here...

550
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:10,374
a TV...

551
00:53:11,583 --> 00:53:12,415
a bathroom...

552
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:15,624
a bed too.

553
00:53:16,875 --> 00:53:21,624
Wow! This car is like a house on wheels!

554
00:53:21,833 --> 00:53:23,707
Er... yes. Absolutely!

555
00:53:23,875 --> 00:53:24,790
lt's very comfortable.

556
00:53:25,875 --> 00:53:27,082
Now we should be going.

557
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:28,499
We don't want to miss the Panchayat
(A village body for village governance)

558
00:53:29,083 --> 00:53:35,207
Come on. Let's go.
Come on. Quickly.

559
00:53:35,875 --> 00:53:38,499
District Council is deliberating
upon all the demands...

560
00:53:38,708 --> 00:53:41,207
...made in the last
village panchayat meeting.

561
00:53:41,708 --> 00:53:44,082
The decision will be taken soon.

562
00:53:44,708 --> 00:53:49,082
Sadanandji, please tell us when the
remaining electric wires are being put up?

563
00:53:49,416 --> 00:53:52,082
We plan to start
work as soon as possible.

564
00:53:52,291 --> 00:53:56,082
- The Gram Panchayat ha...
- Just a moment, Sadanand Bajpeiji.

565
00:53:56,291 --> 00:53:57,290
l've never seen a Panchayat before.

566
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:03,874
Whenever you are asked, all you say is
"We plan to start work.

567
00:54:04,083 --> 00:54:05,290
You are the Block Development Officer

568
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:10,082
You are well aware that we have been
dealing with this problem for a long time

569
00:54:11,083 --> 00:54:14,499
75% of the village is constantly plagued
with electricity failures

570
00:54:14,708 --> 00:54:18,082
and the remaining one-fourth
still lives in darkness.

571
00:54:18,291 --> 00:54:23,374
This is like covering your back
while your front's open.

572
00:54:24,375 --> 00:54:25,707
Then, what's the use of
these electric wires?

573
00:54:25,875 --> 00:54:30,082
Dadaji, the Government Surveyor has
recorded his observations...

574
00:54:30,291 --> 00:54:32,290
it is now just a matter of a few days.

575
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:33,415
A few days?

576
00:54:33,708 --> 00:54:36,290
ln a few days l'll be at Heaven's Door.

577
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,707
Then you can come
light a bulb on my shrine.

578
00:54:39,083 --> 00:54:43,624
Dadaji, don't say that,
may you live a long life!

579
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:47,874
Please don't mind Dadaji, even l have
a complaint against the village.

580
00:54:48,083 --> 00:54:51,874
- What?
- One hears that Dukhi, Santram and...

581
00:54:52,625 --> 00:54:55,082
...their boys steal electricity from the poles.

582
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:58,499
lt's not us. lt's Santram who's the culprit.

583
00:54:58,708 --> 00:55:01,290
Hold your tongue! When did
we steal electricity?

584
00:55:01,708 --> 00:55:03,874
Now l understand why there was
no power last evening.

585
00:55:04,083 --> 00:55:10,082
Calm down everyone!

586
00:55:11,291 --> 00:55:16,374
- Sadanandji, this job should be done soon.
- Ok.

587
00:55:16,625 --> 00:55:19,082
Or else we'll take the matter to
the higher authorities.

588
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:21,499
Sangam, what is the next case?

589
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:26,290
- Case No. 35
- The school!

590
00:55:30,291 --> 00:55:31,624
Yes Gitaji?

591
00:55:32,916 --> 00:55:36,082
l wish to continue teaching children
in the existing premises.

592
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,082
The new alternate
place you are suggesting...

593
00:55:38,708 --> 00:55:39,999
is too small...

594
00:55:40,291 --> 00:55:44,082
...and then it's also too far. Children
won't be able to walk so much everyday.

595
00:55:44,291 --> 00:55:46,582
But why do you need such a big
space for the school?

596
00:55:47,041 --> 00:55:49,790
You don't even have enough
children to fill up the classes

597
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,624
More children will come to
study in the school.

598
00:55:52,083 --> 00:55:54,207
That's what you've been saying
for a year now!

599
00:55:54,625 --> 00:55:56,874
She has been trying!
We've all been trying!

600
00:55:57,083 --> 00:56:01,499
Look Dadaji, we need the school
space for the Panchayat.

601
00:56:01,875 --> 00:56:03,499
Then the tehsildars also want to
establish their office in the school.

602
00:56:03,708 --> 00:56:06,957
The village also needs a spare
room for the granary.

603
00:56:07,375 --> 00:56:10,290
lt will be the economic
center of the village.

604
00:56:10,625 --> 00:56:15,415
And the place we are offering you
is good enough for teaching.

605
00:56:16,291 --> 00:56:17,290
No, it won't be enough

606
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:19,707
want to start a few more
classes in the school.

607
00:56:20,416 --> 00:56:23,082
l want to reinstate those children

608
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,415
who've left the school
in the past couple of years.

609
00:56:26,875 --> 00:56:30,082
And then there are some villagers who
are not sending their children to school.

610
00:56:30,291 --> 00:56:33,499
Today, l appeal to all of them to
send their children to school.

611
00:56:38,291 --> 00:56:39,624
All right, Gita.

612
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:42,874
lf you can manage to enroll more
children in the next three months

613
00:56:43,416 --> 00:56:44,582
then we're ready to reconsider.

614
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,499
But if there are no new admissions...

615
00:56:48,083 --> 00:56:52,707
then you must agree to move
from the current premises.

616
00:56:54,208 --> 00:56:57,874
This month's Panchayat is adjourned.

617
00:57:07,291 --> 00:57:10,082
Come Mohan, let me introduce you
to the members of the Panch.

618
00:57:17,875 --> 00:57:20,874
- This is my Mohan.
He has just come from America.
- Okay.

619
00:57:21,083 --> 00:57:23,874
- Mohan... this is the head of our village
- Vishnuduttji.

620
00:57:24,083 --> 00:57:24,707
Hello.

621
00:57:27,208 --> 00:57:30,082
- Namaste! (Greetings)
- My blessings, son!

622
00:57:30,291 --> 00:57:31,165
Munishwarji.

623
00:57:32,875 --> 00:57:35,290
God bless you my son.

624
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,082
- Gungadinji.
- Namaste.

625
00:57:37,375 --> 00:57:39,290
- Fatimabi...
- May you live long my son.

626
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:40,207
...and Narayanji.

627
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:41,874
God bless you son.

628
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:43,707
May Lord Rama protect you.

629
00:57:44,291 --> 00:57:45,957
What do you do in America?

630
00:57:47,125 --> 00:57:50,374
l work in a company called NASA.

631
00:57:51,166 --> 00:57:52,707
So, what does this
company manufacture?

632
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,374
We make satellites.

633
00:57:58,708 --> 00:57:59,707
Now what is that?

634
00:58:00,291 --> 00:58:01,749
Oh come on, Fatima...

635
00:58:02,208 --> 00:58:05,165
...you know those things in the sky.

636
00:58:06,291 --> 00:58:10,707
- Satellites er satellites
- Let me explain.

637
00:58:12,291 --> 00:58:15,082
Satellites are like
the moon orbiting earth,

638
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,624
which help us to know when,
where and how much it will rain

639
00:58:17,875 --> 00:58:19,290
predict the changes in the atmosphere

640
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:20,874
they send us information
about all these things.

641
00:58:21,083 --> 00:58:23,290
- That's it!
- lsn't this what you had told me?

642
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:31,290
Wow Kaveri l'm impressed! l had no idea
you knew so much

643
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:31,874
...about these things.

644
00:58:32,083 --> 00:58:37,874
All this work that you have described
is done by our Sahdev out here

645
00:58:38,083 --> 00:58:39,874
without rotating himself, believe me!

646
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:42,082
Hey Sahdev, tell us!

647
00:58:43,625 --> 00:58:45,290
The sky is clear.

648
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:49,790
There will be no clouds in
evidence for the next two days.

649
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:54,082
Very good! That's precisely what l do.

650
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:11,624
Mohan bhaiyya! Look!
That's the temple!

651
00:59:14,875 --> 00:59:15,624
Beautiful!

652
00:59:18,166 --> 00:59:20,290
Beautiful! What's this?

653
00:59:21,083 --> 00:59:22,957
This is the specialty of our village.

654
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:28,832
These are the footprints of
Lord Rama and Sita.

655
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:29,749
What?!

656
00:59:31,625 --> 00:59:35,374
Ram and Sita's footprints!

657
00:59:39,541 --> 00:59:41,374
Charanpur! Ok.

658
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:47,374
That explains the name of the village
Charanpur. (Charan means feet)

659
01:00:22,958 --> 01:00:24,749
- How are you?
- l'm all right.

660
01:00:25,291 --> 01:00:28,374
- And Kaveriamma? How is she?
- She's fine.

661
01:00:29,541 --> 01:00:31,290
l've been trying your cell phone.

662
01:00:32,375 --> 01:00:34,749
There is no network coverage here.

663
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:40,540
Vinod l'm no longer in Delhi.
l'm in a village called Charanpur.

664
01:00:41,166 --> 01:00:44,957
Oh. Anyway now what about
the GPM instrument concept

665
01:00:45,166 --> 01:00:47,290
and risk reduction study
that needs to be initialized.

666
01:00:47,541 --> 01:00:49,540
l'll e-mail you the graphics right away!

667
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:52,540
You do that. But the internet
connection here is weak.

668
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:54,374
l won't be able to
download the graphics.

669
01:00:54,625 --> 01:00:58,374
Why don't you Fed-Ex the CD to
Rahul in Delhi? He'll send it to me.

670
01:00:58,958 --> 01:00:59,540
Okay.

671
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:01,540
Come fast.

672
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:04,749
One more thing! The week will
pass by very quickly

673
01:01:04,958 --> 01:01:05,957
All right.

674
01:01:06,541 --> 01:01:08,540
l am going to be here a
little longer than l thought.

675
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:10,540
Kaveriamma has some pending work here

676
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:12,957
because of which she can't leave right away.

677
01:01:14,041 --> 01:01:14,957
Ok. That's fine.

678
01:01:15,166 --> 01:01:16,957
Can l have a word with John
regarding this? ls he there?

679
01:01:17,166 --> 01:01:18,957
Don't worry about that
l will take care about that.

680
01:01:19,541 --> 01:01:20,957
- See you then.
- Bye.

681
01:01:21,625 --> 01:01:22,749
Jai Ramji ki.
(Lord Ram be praised).

682
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:28,749
- Well, well... the village lingo's getting a hold on you. Jai Ramji ki!
- Bye.
- Bye.

683
01:01:28,958 --> 01:01:29,540
One moment.

684
01:01:32,541 --> 01:01:35,374
How much was that?
Five hundred and eighteen rupees?

685
01:01:36,041 --> 01:01:37,540
Five hundred eighteen rupees sir!

686
01:01:44,166 --> 01:01:45,165
One moment sir.

687
01:01:46,291 --> 01:01:48,540
Sir, you just mentioned
the word "internet".

688
01:01:49,458 --> 01:01:50,749
l've heard the word "international".

689
01:01:50,958 --> 01:01:55,874
but 'lnternet'? What's that?
l think l've heard it before.

690
01:01:56,166 --> 01:02:00,540
lnternet... lnternet is a medium
through which we can...

691
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:04,082
...connect and communicate
with people in any part of the world.

692
01:02:04,291 --> 01:02:07,165
No Post-office needed!
This is called e-mail.

693
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:12,165
E-mail! Really?
Fantastic!

694
01:02:12,541 --> 01:02:16,749
lf this e-mail is somehow
installed in this village

695
01:02:17,291 --> 01:02:20,540
- l'll be in seventh heaven.
- How is that?

696
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:23,540
Because then l wouldn't have
to deliver any letters.

697
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:28,374
l would just sit here and
email them all.

698
01:02:28,958 --> 01:02:33,749
Email is indeed the summum bonum

699
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:35,540
it would break the walls that...

700
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:37,957
...separate home and the world.

701
01:02:39,958 --> 01:02:43,165
- Thank you sir.
- Okay.

702
01:03:01,041 --> 01:03:02,832
Time to get up!

703
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:08,749
Kaveriamma, don't wake me up!
Haven't slept like this in years.

704
01:03:09,541 --> 01:03:12,040
Get up. We have
a lot of work to do now.

705
01:03:12,291 --> 01:03:15,957
The guests will be here at eleven.
The house needs to be cleaned.

706
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:19,874
What's going on?
Who are the guests?

707
01:03:20,833 --> 01:03:24,624
A potential groom is coming to
see Gita with his parents.

708
01:03:25,041 --> 01:03:25,957
What?

709
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:28,957
- They are from Azamgarh.
- Gita's marriage?

710
01:03:29,166 --> 01:03:30,374
- Yes!
- Yes?

711
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:32,874
Gita's marriage...!

712
01:03:33,541 --> 01:03:35,165
l forgot to tell you last night.

713
01:03:35,875 --> 01:03:39,624
About two months ago, Vishwasji,
the boy's father had written to me.

714
01:03:40,291 --> 01:03:42,040
Now finally they'll be here today.

715
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:44,374
- But what is the need for all this?
- What do you mean?

716
01:03:44,541 --> 01:03:48,957
l mean... l mean what's the rush?
She's just a child!

717
01:03:51,166 --> 01:03:55,749
What a strange thing to say!
Come on, get ready.

718
01:03:56,291 --> 01:03:59,165
Why should l get ready?
As if they're coming to see me!

719
01:04:32,666 --> 01:04:35,165
- This is Gita.
- Namaste!

720
01:04:35,625 --> 01:04:37,749
- This is Raghunath.
- Namaste!

721
01:04:37,958 --> 01:04:38,540
Please sit.

722
01:04:43,666 --> 01:04:44,957
Excuse me, l'll just be back.

723
01:04:53,416 --> 01:04:57,165
- l've heard... you run a school here.
- Yes.

724
01:05:08,166 --> 01:05:09,957
We have a chemicals business.

725
01:05:10,541 --> 01:05:11,165
Really.

726
01:05:41,958 --> 01:05:44,040
The demand that you are making
is not acceptable to me.

727
01:05:45,375 --> 01:05:49,040
Teaching is my profession
and my passion.

728
01:05:49,458 --> 01:05:52,540
And l'd like to continue
this work even after marriage.

729
01:05:53,375 --> 01:05:55,749
A woman's hands are full just
with the household chores.

730
01:05:56,375 --> 01:06:00,165
l disagree! l'd like to take care of the
house as well as work.

731
01:06:00,375 --> 01:06:03,749
Let me tell you, that we would not like the
women of our household to work outside

732
01:06:04,541 --> 01:06:08,040
Besides l fail to see why you would
want to keep working after marriage?

733
01:06:08,958 --> 01:06:11,165
What if l say the same to your son?

734
01:06:13,125 --> 01:06:16,165
My parents too have brought me up
with equal love and affection...

735
01:06:16,958 --> 01:06:18,457
they expect me to live my life with

736
01:06:19,083 --> 01:06:22,874
self-esteem,
independence and self-reliance.

737
01:06:23,541 --> 01:06:29,165
lf your son has a desire to be something
in life, to make a mark in society

738
01:06:29,375 --> 01:06:31,540
then why can't women
have the same desire?

739
01:06:32,166 --> 01:06:35,540
Be it in any field women are
making their mark equally.

740
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:39,874
There's more to a woman than
just wearing bangles.

741
01:06:41,083 --> 01:06:43,749
And after marriage, aren't the house
and the children as much...

742
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:46,249
...a responsibility of the man
as the woman?

743
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,957
Why can't the husband and wife
work as a team?

744
01:06:51,291 --> 01:06:53,540
Why should one of them sacrifice
more than the other?

745
01:06:57,541 --> 01:07:01,249
l don't accept the demand of not
being allowed to work after marriage.

746
01:07:02,875 --> 01:07:05,957
You mean... are you rejecting
this proposal?

747
01:07:06,625 --> 01:07:08,040
l have nothing else to say...

748
01:07:23,958 --> 01:07:28,374
This is how the new generation thinks.

749
01:07:29,625 --> 01:07:34,165
We should not carry this
matter any further!

750
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:38,290
l'm sorry Shardaji, Vishwasji.

751
01:07:39,666 --> 01:07:40,749
lt's all right.

752
01:08:30,541 --> 01:08:34,374
- l'm upset with what happened today.
- But l felt l was right.

753
01:08:34,958 --> 01:08:37,749
l don't think you should have
expressed your views in this way.

754
01:08:37,958 --> 01:08:40,165
Whatever it is, this is
against my principles.

755
01:08:40,458 --> 01:08:42,749
Kaveriamma, Gita is right.

756
01:08:43,541 --> 01:08:44,957
But Mohan, he was a nice boy.

757
01:08:45,166 --> 01:08:48,957
You can change people's views
about life over a period of time.

758
01:08:49,166 --> 01:08:53,749
- Well, you do have a point there.
- No, l couldn't have changed him.

759
01:08:55,750 --> 01:09:00,957
Habits can be altered over time but
narrow opinions and beliefs cannot be.

760
01:09:01,541 --> 01:09:02,957
l'm absolutely sure

761
01:09:03,166 --> 01:09:05,374
that their next demand would
be the dowry amount.

762
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:10,040
Quite possible. l completely
agree with you.

763
01:09:10,541 --> 01:09:17,040
This thinking is imbedded in our culture
& tradition and it hampers the nation.

764
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:18,165
Excuse me.

765
01:09:18,375 --> 01:09:23,165
Without culture and tradition the
country would be left with no soul.

766
01:09:23,875 --> 01:09:26,957
But Mohan, we are not talking
about the country.

767
01:09:27,875 --> 01:09:31,290
l know Kaveriamma,
but it's all connected, isn't it?

768
01:09:32,041 --> 01:09:35,374
What is this soul you talk off Gita?
We are plagued with problems.

769
01:09:35,958 --> 01:09:38,540
Will you disagree, when l say that
illiteracy is rampant?

770
01:09:39,166 --> 01:09:41,874
That we have administrative problems!

771
01:09:42,083 --> 01:09:44,290
We are yet under-developed.

772
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:49,082
That's true! llliteracy and
poverty are hand in glove!

773
01:09:49,375 --> 01:09:52,749
Kaveriamma, your village has
not even got electricity yet.

774
01:09:53,666 --> 01:09:58,040
Caste discrimination, overpopulation,
unemployment and corruption...

775
01:09:59,375 --> 01:10:02,457
...our state of affairs is pathetic.
Pass me the salt.

776
01:10:03,166 --> 01:10:06,165
You have drifted from our topic. But since
you've brought this up, let me tell you...

777
01:10:06,375 --> 01:10:08,957
...the Government is trying to find
solutions for these problems.

778
01:10:09,166 --> 01:10:11,540
Yes! Yes! We'll see how much good
their solutions will bring.

779
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:13,457
The infrastructure that the Government
has is not enough to

780
01:10:13,958 --> 01:10:16,374
cope with even...
1/4th of the existing population,

781
01:10:16,541 --> 01:10:19,540
The Government has always failed
in satisfying the peoples' needs.

782
01:10:20,125 --> 01:10:22,957
The Government is making policies,
making efforts.

783
01:10:23,166 --> 01:10:23,957
What do you mean by 'efforts'?

784
01:10:24,166 --> 01:10:28,665
Just to make resolutions & collect funds for them

785
01:10:28,875 --> 01:10:30,290
is that where the
Government's work ends?

786
01:10:31,083 --> 01:10:34,499
Whether this money even reaches
the grassroot level...

787
01:10:34,958 --> 01:10:38,290
...whether the common man benefits
or not from their resolutions...

788
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,165
...are they not responsible
for that as well?

789
01:10:40,375 --> 01:10:41,374
- Yes they are.
- Then...

790
01:10:41,958 --> 01:10:43,749
But what do you think the
Government is, after all?

791
01:10:43,958 --> 01:10:47,165
The Government is a system, of
which the public is also a part.

792
01:10:47,708 --> 01:10:51,165
You, me, this village... all of us!

793
01:10:51,541 --> 01:10:53,540
Now if the system is lacking
in certain things, then...

794
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:57,374
...to rectify its weaknesses
is our responsibility as well.

795
01:10:57,541 --> 01:11:01,957
God helps only those
who help themselves.

796
01:11:02,166 --> 01:11:05,040
Yes Kaveriamma, but things
are not going to change here.

797
01:11:05,541 --> 01:11:07,749
Because no one wants to change!

798
01:11:08,583 --> 01:11:12,374
lt's easy for you to criticize.
But are you doing anything about it? No!

799
01:11:12,541 --> 01:11:13,165
Excuse me.

800
01:11:13,375 --> 01:11:16,040
At least, l am not defending
the government like you.

801
01:11:16,708 --> 01:11:21,374
l'm building satellites to help
technology advance.

802
01:11:21,541 --> 01:11:22,749
For everyone mankind!

803
01:11:23,291 --> 01:11:24,874
- Some more curry?
- No!

804
01:11:27,208 --> 01:11:28,749
But you are doing it all there.

805
01:11:28,958 --> 01:11:31,540
l'm doing all that l can here,
at the village grass root level.

806
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:33,665
l'm trying to make this a better place!

807
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:36,374
Gita... you too are a typical lndian!

808
01:11:36,958 --> 01:11:38,749
You lndians can't take criticism.

809
01:11:39,458 --> 01:11:40,540
You lndians?

810
01:11:43,041 --> 01:11:45,624
Sorry, l mean... we lndians...!

811
01:11:47,541 --> 01:11:50,290
Anyway, we are aware that not much has
changed in our country in a long time.

812
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,540
But l still want to try
and make a difference.

813
01:11:54,541 --> 01:11:56,040
You have given up all hope.

814
01:11:56,625 --> 01:11:57,499
No l haven't. .

815
01:11:57,875 --> 01:11:59,749
- Yes you have!
- No l haven't!!

816
01:12:01,958 --> 01:12:02,749
She's really a fighter, isn't she?

817
01:12:03,541 --> 01:12:05,082
You're no less yourself!

818
01:12:06,541 --> 01:12:09,165
Now what is to become of this girl?
He was such a nice boy.

819
01:12:09,375 --> 01:12:11,165
- There are other boys...
- l know

820
01:12:12,458 --> 01:12:14,457
But it is not easy to please Gita.

821
01:12:15,958 --> 01:12:18,290
She has too many expectations.

822
01:12:19,041 --> 01:12:20,874
To top all this, there is the school case.

823
01:12:21,166 --> 01:12:24,540
And until both these problems are solved
you won't be able to leave with me.

824
01:12:25,541 --> 01:12:28,040
l have a plan...
let's split up the work.

825
01:12:28,541 --> 01:12:30,165
l'm the boy... l mean...

826
01:12:30,375 --> 01:12:32,749
you find a boy and
l will find children for the school.

827
01:12:33,291 --> 01:12:35,082
We'll round off all of
Gita's problems.

828
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:38,374
What did you say?

829
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:40,957
Nothing. Nothing at all!

830
01:12:45,041 --> 01:12:46,957
Hail the Lord of Strength!

831
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:49,749
This is the first lesson in wrestling.

832
01:12:49,958 --> 01:12:51,165
Remember it.

833
01:12:53,375 --> 01:12:56,957
There's no letter for you Mohan babu.

834
01:12:57,166 --> 01:12:59,749
You're a wrestler as well?

835
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:02,040
l have been wrestling
since l was a child

836
01:13:02,375 --> 01:13:06,374
- ...and it's my favourite hobby.
- Very good.

837
01:13:10,875 --> 01:13:12,749
Just out of curiosity, till what
grade have you studied?

838
01:13:12,958 --> 01:13:16,249
l mean, you must have worked
very hard to gain this post.

839
01:13:16,541 --> 01:13:17,624
l am a graduate!

840
01:13:18,166 --> 01:13:22,374
- How fortunate you are!
- Fortunate... yes!

841
01:13:22,541 --> 01:13:23,749
But l've also studied very
hard to attain this post.

842
01:13:23,958 --> 01:13:25,165
l'm sure you studied hard

843
01:13:25,375 --> 01:13:27,874
but at least you had the
opportunity to go to High School.

844
01:13:28,875 --> 01:13:31,499
l feel very sorry for the
village children.

845
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:34,165
- Why is that?
- l'll explain.

846
01:13:35,958 --> 01:13:39,665
What are your views on the school case?

847
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:41,749
The school case? lt's very simple.

848
01:13:41,958 --> 01:13:44,540
The school must move from here.
That space is needed for the Panchayat.

849
01:13:45,291 --> 01:13:47,540
That is why l feel bad for
the children of the village.

850
01:13:48,375 --> 01:13:52,374
Look... the Panchayat is not allowing for
a High School to be started here

851
01:13:52,541 --> 01:13:56,040
and what good is it going to be for
children to have studied till 4th Std?

852
01:13:56,375 --> 01:14:01,040
lf they want to succeed in life like you
then they must go to High School.

853
01:14:01,958 --> 01:14:02,540
True...!

854
01:14:04,541 --> 01:14:05,290
Look!

855
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:10,957
lt's here the high school will stand.
The children will study here.

856
01:14:11,375 --> 01:14:16,624
Then they can start writing letters
for their parents themselves.

857
01:14:16,958 --> 01:14:20,290
Think about the work it will save you.

858
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:23,874
l think the school
should not shift from here.

859
01:14:24,541 --> 01:14:26,540
l will talk to people in the village.

860
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:28,749
- You must!
- Definitely

861
01:14:30,875 --> 01:14:33,040
- Praise the Lord of Might.
- Praise the Lord of Might.

862
01:14:34,458 --> 01:14:35,165
Mohanbabu...

863
01:14:35,541 --> 01:14:36,165
Yes?

864
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:43,040
Why don't you drop by our
wrestling ring sometime?

865
01:14:43,541 --> 01:14:45,040
Sure, why not?

866
01:14:46,625 --> 01:14:48,374
How about a wrestling session?

867
01:14:51,166 --> 01:14:52,040
Sure!

868
01:14:58,750 --> 01:15:00,540
Mohan babu,
l have a surprise for you...

869
01:15:00,875 --> 01:15:03,457
Here... have some pakodas with
shimla mirch tandoori.

870
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:05,957
l've made it specially for you.

871
01:15:06,166 --> 01:15:10,374
- ls this all that you can make?
- No sir, l can cook whatever you desire.

872
01:15:10,958 --> 01:15:13,165
Got it. Listen Mela Ram...

873
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:14,624
Please don't say a word.

874
01:15:15,041 --> 01:15:17,165
- l know what you have on your mind.
- What?

875
01:15:17,875 --> 01:15:20,499
Actually l was thinking...
you must have felt bad.

876
01:15:20,833 --> 01:15:22,957
l'll give you 60%.

877
01:15:23,291 --> 01:15:25,374
l'll give you 60% in partnership.

878
01:15:25,541 --> 01:15:26,374
Okay.

879
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:29,040
Your lunch and dinner
will be on the house!

880
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:32,290
l have changed the name of our dhaba.

881
01:15:33,166 --> 01:15:37,165
We can call it Mohan's Mela Ram Dhaba

882
01:15:37,541 --> 01:15:39,165
or Mela Ram's Mohan Dhaba.

883
01:15:40,166 --> 01:15:42,040
You decide. Then we'll lock it.

884
01:15:42,375 --> 01:15:44,540
The first one sounds ok.
Mohan's Mela Ram Dhaba.

885
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:48,040
Ok then sir... So deal done, sir?

886
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:51,624
But before that,
you'll have to help me.

887
01:15:51,833 --> 01:15:54,165
- Help? How?
- l wish to send the kids from...

888
01:15:54,375 --> 01:15:57,374
...your community to the school
for which l need your help.

889
01:15:57,875 --> 01:15:58,957
Understood.

890
01:16:00,125 --> 01:16:02,749
But it's little difficult sir.

891
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:05,290
Well, then your going to America

892
01:16:06,291 --> 01:16:07,540
also looks little 'difficult' to me.

893
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:08,749
lt is easy sir.

894
01:16:08,958 --> 01:16:11,290
l'm ready. Just tell me what l need to do.

895
01:16:11,875 --> 01:16:15,374
Our children and their kids in
the same school? Never!

896
01:16:16,541 --> 01:16:20,457
Lions and sheep never drink water
from the same pond, Mohanbabu.

897
01:16:27,458 --> 01:16:28,749
So...

898
01:16:29,875 --> 01:16:31,290
...what is your background?

899
01:16:33,666 --> 01:16:34,749
l mean...

900
01:16:35,875 --> 01:16:36,957
what caste are you?

901
01:16:38,958 --> 01:16:40,957
l'm a Brahmin!

902
01:16:42,541 --> 01:16:44,957
Then learn to behave like one.

903
01:16:45,875 --> 01:16:47,165
So what am l expected to do?

904
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:51,165
We've heard that you eat food,
cooked by Mela Ram.

905
01:16:51,958 --> 01:16:54,165
Are you aware what his caste is?

906
01:16:55,166 --> 01:16:59,165
But what difference does that make?
What age are you folks living in?

907
01:16:59,541 --> 01:17:01,874
Don't you dare degrade our piety!

908
01:17:02,291 --> 01:17:05,165
You've fallen, are you out to
drag us down too?

909
01:17:05,541 --> 01:17:10,457
And you Nivaaranji, seems like
you've switched sides already!

910
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:14,040
l am only doing what l think is right.

911
01:17:14,458 --> 01:17:17,457
lf you have any objections
you don't have to accept this.

912
01:17:33,166 --> 01:17:37,165
Hey Birsa. Mohanbabu wants to
have a word with you.

913
01:17:38,708 --> 01:17:41,540
What has happened sir?
Have we done anything wrong?

914
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:44,749
No, not at all.
l just came to ask...

915
01:17:45,458 --> 01:17:47,540
...if you would you like to send
your children to school?

916
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:54,374
Huzoor, the villagers that do not
allow us to work in the village...

917
01:17:55,291 --> 01:17:57,749
...do you think they will agree
to educate our children?

918
01:17:59,458 --> 01:18:03,374
Don't worry.
Your kids will go to school.

919
01:18:04,166 --> 01:18:08,874
Also, of what use is studying, now that
they are in their marriageable age?

920
01:18:09,166 --> 01:18:12,749
My daughter Lajwa is going
to be engaged.

921
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:15,749
Child marriage!

922
01:18:19,541 --> 01:18:23,457
Can you not see our situation?
We barely manage to fill our stomachs.

923
01:18:23,958 --> 01:18:25,957
Who is going to pay their school fees?

924
01:18:26,958 --> 01:18:29,040
Gitaji doesn't run the school for money.

925
01:18:30,541 --> 01:18:33,957
Teaching is her passion... her life!

926
01:18:35,458 --> 01:18:37,040
lf we speak with her

927
01:18:37,458 --> 01:18:39,499
we can assure you that
she will help you.

928
01:18:40,041 --> 01:18:43,540
The village folks don't
want to see us around.

929
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:45,040
Just listen to me...

930
01:18:46,166 --> 01:18:47,374
Let it be saheb.

931
01:18:48,583 --> 01:18:51,457
Education is not in their destiny.

932
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:54,957
Not in my children's destiny.

933
01:19:02,166 --> 01:19:03,540
What have you decided Vishnoji?

934
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:05,540
Studies are not going to
fill an empty stomach!

935
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:07,749
Since pottery will be their livelihood

936
01:19:07,958 --> 01:19:09,457
then why waste time studying?

937
01:19:10,625 --> 01:19:12,957
Have you made these?
They are beautiful.

938
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:16,457
Tell me. How much do
you sell this pot for?

939
01:19:16,625 --> 01:19:18,499
- Thirty rupees.
- What!

940
01:19:18,958 --> 01:19:20,749
We have a contractor in the city,
who buys it from us.

941
01:19:20,958 --> 01:19:23,540
Sometimes we even get an extra
five-ten rupees.

942
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:26,040
We won't sell it for less than thirty!

943
01:19:26,875 --> 01:19:28,957
The price of this pot in the city
is 100 rupees or more.

944
01:19:29,166 --> 01:19:32,374
Maybe if you people were educated
you wouldn't be fooled like this.

945
01:19:32,541 --> 01:19:37,290
l know that this art has been
passed down through generations.

946
01:19:37,541 --> 01:19:40,957
l agree that your kids should
carry on this tradition.

947
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:44,165
But in this day and age, it is
crucial for them to be educated.

948
01:19:44,375 --> 01:19:45,749
- ls it not Nivaaranji?
- Absolutely.

949
01:19:46,541 --> 01:19:50,749
Because education will help them take
this art to its deserving end...

950
01:19:50,958 --> 01:19:53,040
...and earn appropriate prices.

951
01:19:53,833 --> 01:19:57,749
You are selling us a dream!
Don't show us these dreams.

952
01:20:11,833 --> 01:20:13,374
Namaste Sarpanchji.

953
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:16,957
Welcome Nivaaranji.
Welcome Mohanji.

954
01:20:17,291 --> 01:20:20,374
Mohanbabu wanted to discuss
the school with you.

955
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:23,374
l know, l know. Let me tell you...

956
01:20:23,541 --> 01:20:24,374
that both my grandsons
are enrolled in the school.

957
01:20:24,875 --> 01:20:28,749
We have great respect for
education in this house.

958
01:20:29,041 --> 01:20:31,957
But l have heard that you have
two grand daughters as well

959
01:20:32,166 --> 01:20:34,374
and both of them have dropped out?

960
01:20:34,750 --> 01:20:36,749
Oh yes, Kusum and Suman...

961
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:39,957
They have both studied
till the fourth grade.

962
01:20:40,375 --> 01:20:42,749
Now how much more can they study?

963
01:20:43,291 --> 01:20:45,374
lt's time for them
to learn household work

964
01:20:45,541 --> 01:20:47,374
cooking and such things.

965
01:20:47,541 --> 01:20:50,374
After all, this is what will help
them once they get married.

966
01:20:50,541 --> 01:20:51,749
How can you say such things?

967
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:54,957
Education instills confidence in girls.

968
01:20:55,541 --> 01:20:57,540
Don't you want to see
them study and live their lives

969
01:20:57,750 --> 01:21:02,540
with self-respect... independence and...
self-reliance?

970
01:21:03,958 --> 01:21:06,374
There's more to a woman
than just wearing bangles.

971
01:21:06,750 --> 01:21:09,165
Agreed Mohanji!

972
01:21:10,166 --> 01:21:12,624
But Charanpur does not even
have a High School

973
01:21:13,166 --> 01:21:14,749
for these girls to study in.

974
01:21:15,541 --> 01:21:18,165
But Mizwa village does.
You could have sent them there.

975
01:21:18,375 --> 01:21:20,165
But now you don't need to
worry about that

976
01:21:20,541 --> 01:21:23,957
because Gitaji is planning to open
a High School in Charanpur.

977
01:21:24,541 --> 01:21:26,249
lf she has your support that is.

978
01:21:32,375 --> 01:21:33,749
Do support us.

979
01:21:44,541 --> 01:21:46,165
No Mohanbabu!
Not possible.

980
01:21:46,375 --> 01:21:49,374
But how long are you going to control the
children's lives with caste & community?

981
01:21:49,541 --> 01:21:53,457
Who are you to tell us what
we should be doing?

982
01:21:54,458 --> 01:21:57,249
How much do you know about the
ways and problems of this village?

983
01:21:58,291 --> 01:21:59,957
l accept that you were
born in this country

984
01:22:00,166 --> 01:22:03,374
but that doesn't mean you can
go around giving sermons.

985
01:22:04,166 --> 01:22:08,749
We understand perfectly what we need
to do for the progress of our village.

986
01:22:08,958 --> 01:22:11,249
But the only ones who stand to
lose are the children.

987
01:22:11,458 --> 01:22:13,749
Enough of this! l don't want
to argue with you.

988
01:22:13,958 --> 01:22:14,540
Father.

989
01:22:15,166 --> 01:22:19,540
For heaven's sake, stay out
of the village matters.

990
01:22:19,958 --> 01:22:23,374
Mohanbabu, you are just a visitor here

991
01:22:23,541 --> 01:22:26,540
roam around, enjoy the village...
why get into all this?

992
01:22:26,750 --> 01:22:30,374
Attention!
A movie is to be screened in Charanpur.

993
01:22:30,541 --> 01:22:33,749
Tonight the Panchayat has organized
a movie screening in the village.

994
01:22:34,958 --> 01:22:41,374
You must come and watch...
you'll enjoy!

995
01:22:51,375 --> 01:22:55,374
Get down.

996
01:23:05,625 --> 01:23:06,165
Ok sir, we'll meet later.

997
01:23:08,833 --> 01:23:10,165
Why? Won't you see the movie?

998
01:23:10,541 --> 01:23:11,540
l'll be sitting this side and
watching the movie.

999
01:23:12,541 --> 01:23:13,165
Okay.

1000
01:23:29,875 --> 01:23:31,290
By the way, which film
are they showing?

1001
01:23:31,541 --> 01:23:33,749
- Yaadon ki Baaraat! (Union of Memories)
- Who's union?

1002
01:23:34,375 --> 01:23:38,290
- Union of Memories!
- Oh, l heard...our union!

1003
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:40,957
Shut up

1004
01:23:41,166 --> 01:23:44,957
Just kidding! lt's one
of my favorite films.

1005
01:23:45,166 --> 01:23:47,165
Please turn off your lanterns
the film is about to begin.

1006
01:23:50,166 --> 01:23:52,540
Dear lords, kind patrons
and art-lovers!

1007
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:54,540
Here's an important announcement

1008
01:23:54,750 --> 01:23:59,749
Mothers must keep a vigilant eye upon
children during the screening.

1009
01:24:00,291 --> 01:24:03,540
And please don't disturb your neighbour.

1010
01:24:03,875 --> 01:24:09,374
So, presenting the separation
and union of three brothers.

1011
01:24:09,541 --> 01:24:13,165
Todays' movie is...
Yaadon ki Baaraat.

1012
01:24:52,375 --> 01:24:55,957
- Are you going to sing a song, which
you used to sing every year?
- Yes.

1013
01:26:33,041 --> 01:26:34,374
What happened?

1014
01:26:35,166 --> 01:26:36,749
What happened to the movie?

1015
01:26:36,958 --> 01:26:39,457
Not a power failure again!

1016
01:26:40,958 --> 01:26:42,165
Chikku, it's just temporary.

1017
01:26:42,375 --> 01:26:44,040
No, it won't come back. l know it won't.

1018
01:26:44,250 --> 01:26:46,249
How much time will this take?

1019
01:26:46,458 --> 01:26:48,957
lt will take twenty minutes
to start the generator.

1020
01:26:49,166 --> 01:26:49,749
Hurry up.

1021
01:26:49,958 --> 01:26:50,957
Don't cry now children!

1022
01:26:51,166 --> 01:26:52,374
Everyone quiet!

1023
01:26:52,375 --> 01:26:54,165
Sit down.

1024
01:26:58,541 --> 01:27:04,540
All the children on the other side,
quiet!

1025
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:07,374
Don't cry. Now, listen to me carefully.

1026
01:27:07,750 --> 01:27:16,749
Everybody, now look up at the sky
and tell me what you see.

1027
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:22,374
The stars!

1028
01:27:24,750 --> 01:27:30,457
Now tell me... can you see the stars
forming a plough?

1029
01:27:33,375 --> 01:27:34,957
Plough?

1030
01:27:36,750 --> 01:27:39,957
Yes, plough.
Do you see it?

1031
01:27:43,541 --> 01:27:45,957
- No.
- l'll help you.

1032
01:27:47,958 --> 01:27:49,040
Look...

1033
01:27:49,291 --> 01:27:52,624
can you see that brightest star
in the sky?

1034
01:27:53,875 --> 01:27:55,499
- Can you see it?
-Yes.

1035
01:27:56,041 --> 01:27:59,749
Along that star on the right
are three stars in a line.

1036
01:27:59,958 --> 01:28:01,290
Yes.

1037
01:28:04,166 --> 01:28:06,165
- Can you see them?
- Yes.

1038
01:28:06,541 --> 01:28:12,749
Now below the third star,
five stars form a curve to the left.

1039
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:22,540
- Can you see them?
- Yes.

1040
01:28:22,750 --> 01:28:27,040
Now look at them as one.

1041
01:28:31,375 --> 01:28:35,165
Look closely. You will see
the plough taking shape.

1042
01:28:55,541 --> 01:28:56,957
l can see it!

1043
01:28:58,375 --> 01:28:58,957
Yes, plough.

1044
01:29:03,541 --> 01:29:05,040
So what we must understand is...

1045
01:29:05,666 --> 01:29:07,749
...if we want, these stars

1046
01:29:08,375 --> 01:29:12,374
...we can make anything out of them.

1047
01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:18,374
But if we look at each star,
Though it looks beautiful,

1048
01:29:20,875 --> 01:29:23,749
...it is only a shimmering lone star.

1049
01:30:00,958 --> 01:30:08,040
This star, the one yonder
and every little star

1050
01:30:08,375 --> 01:30:11,832
Fancy, the one who would
love from afar

1051
01:30:12,166 --> 01:30:15,374
This star, the one yonder
and every little star

1052
01:30:15,541 --> 01:30:18,957
Shouldst these but together shimmer

1053
01:30:19,166 --> 01:30:22,749
Entire firmament is filled with glimmer

1054
01:30:22,958 --> 01:30:26,374
Shouldst these but together shimmer

1055
01:30:26,541 --> 01:30:30,290
Entire firmament is filled with glimmer

1056
01:30:30,541 --> 01:30:33,374
Twinkling stars, a couple o' stars a handful,

1057
01:30:33,541 --> 01:30:35,374
a hundred stars Shimmering luminaries

1058
01:30:35,541 --> 01:30:39,749
every star's a fiery spark!

1059
01:31:12,958 --> 01:31:15,749
Thou hast seen the rainbow

1060
01:31:16,708 --> 01:31:20,040
Pray, how many art the hues?

1061
01:31:20,375 --> 01:31:23,749
Seven colours so to speak

1062
01:31:24,166 --> 01:31:27,540
Yet how many shades its company keep?

1063
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:31,374
Know this to begin,
if the colours wert alone

1064
01:31:31,541 --> 01:31:34,957
How couldst a rainbow be full blown?

1065
01:31:35,166 --> 01:31:38,749
lf we wert not to join hands,
to fight cause unjust

1066
01:31:38,958 --> 01:31:41,957
There wouldst be no public, nor trust

1067
01:31:42,166 --> 01:31:45,749
Know thus and protest not,
that the weak hath lost

1068
01:31:45,958 --> 01:31:49,749
Hmmm... the star, star

1069
01:31:49,958 --> 01:32:00,749
This star, the one yonder
and every little star

1070
01:32:01,083 --> 01:32:04,374
Fancy, the one who would
love from afar

1071
01:32:04,541 --> 01:32:07,957
Shouldst these but
together shimmer

1072
01:32:08,166 --> 01:32:11,957
Entire firmament is filled
with glimmer

1073
01:32:12,166 --> 01:32:15,540
Twinkling stars,
a couple o' stars

1074
01:32:15,750 --> 01:32:17,540
a handful, a hundred star Shimmering
luminaries

1075
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:20,749
every star's a fiery spark!

1076
01:33:01,958 --> 01:33:05,374
Of drops well-gathered

1077
01:33:05,666 --> 01:33:08,957
Doth a river swell

1078
01:33:09,375 --> 01:33:12,749
Ocean too is of drops assembled

1079
01:33:12,958 --> 01:33:16,540
But for the drops, it is but a naught

1080
01:33:16,750 --> 01:33:20,374
Grasp this riddle; for if drop wert
all alone

1081
01:33:20,541 --> 01:33:23,874
lt would be quite nothing.

1082
01:33:24,083 --> 01:33:27,749
Wert we to leave others; desert one
and all,

1083
01:33:27,958 --> 01:33:30,957
Lonely our lot is, to appall.

1084
01:33:31,166 --> 01:33:34,749
Why not unite then in a single current?

1085
01:33:34,958 --> 01:33:38,749
Hmmm... the star, star

1086
01:33:38,958 --> 01:33:45,749
This star, the one yonder
and every little star

1087
01:33:46,291 --> 01:33:49,457
Fancy, the one who would
love from afar

1088
01:33:49,958 --> 01:33:53,165
This star, the one yonder
and every little star

1089
01:33:53,458 --> 01:33:56,957
Shouldst these but
together shimmer

1090
01:33:57,166 --> 01:34:00,874
Entire firmament is filled
with glimmer

1091
01:34:01,083 --> 01:34:02,957
Twinkling stars,
a couple o' stars

1092
01:34:03,166 --> 01:34:06,374
a handful, a hundred stars
Shimmering luminaries

1093
01:34:06,541 --> 01:34:09,165
every star's a fiery spark!

1094
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:16,957
Peasant who wieldeth a plough,
of earth reapeth gold

1095
01:34:47,166 --> 01:34:54,540
Cowherd tending cows,
of milk a river flows

1096
01:34:58,291 --> 01:35:05,290
Blacksmith that mouldeth iron,
every tool fashioneth

1097
01:35:05,541 --> 01:35:12,749
Mud that a potter holdeth,
turneth into pitcher

1098
01:35:12,958 --> 01:35:16,540
All these art the fonts of labour
And of desire to work a wish

1099
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:20,165
None inimical with any
All art united in common dream

1100
01:35:20,375 --> 01:35:27,374
Harken! Everyone's but a kin
None an outsider to pin

1101
01:35:27,541 --> 01:35:30,749
This simple truth, regard thou,
my friend!

1102
01:35:30,958 --> 01:35:35,082
Hmmm... the star, star

1103
01:35:35,291 --> 01:35:41,957
This star, the one yonder
and every little star

1104
01:35:42,541 --> 01:35:45,874
Fancy, the one who would
love from afar

1105
01:35:46,208 --> 01:35:49,374
This star, the one yonder
and every little star

1106
01:35:49,750 --> 01:35:53,165
Shouldst these but
together shimmer

1107
01:35:53,458 --> 01:35:57,165
Entire firmament is filled
with glimmer

1108
01:35:57,375 --> 01:35:59,165
Twinkling stars,
a couple o' stars

1109
01:35:59,375 --> 01:36:01,957
a handful, a hundred stars Shimmering
luminaries

1110
01:36:02,166 --> 01:36:06,165
every star's a fiery spark!

1111
01:36:45,541 --> 01:36:46,165
Gita!

1112
01:36:50,041 --> 01:36:52,082
l want to talk to you
about something important.

1113
01:36:53,375 --> 01:36:54,749
l cannot keep it in me anymore.

1114
01:36:56,541 --> 01:36:57,374
Go on.

1115
01:36:59,541 --> 01:37:01,749
l had recognized you at the
bookshop in Delhi.

1116
01:37:03,208 --> 01:37:05,749
And l'd guessed that you had
come to take Kaveriamma away.

1117
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,040
You did not make a mistake
in the address of Charanpur.

1118
01:37:10,958 --> 01:37:13,165
l had deliberately given you
the wrong directions.

1119
01:37:15,833 --> 01:37:17,540
Why is that?

1120
01:37:19,541 --> 01:37:20,957
Call me childish...

1121
01:37:22,291 --> 01:37:24,874
...but l did not want you
to reach Charanpur

1122
01:37:26,291 --> 01:37:27,499
and to meet Kaveriamma.

1123
01:37:29,375 --> 01:37:33,874
For all that you're doing for the
school, l'd like to thank you!

1124
01:37:35,458 --> 01:37:37,749
But l cannot let you take
Kaveriamma away.

1125
01:37:37,958 --> 01:37:38,749
Why?

1126
01:37:39,541 --> 01:37:40,957
You want her so that

1127
01:37:41,958 --> 01:37:44,957
she can take care of your house
and do all the household chores.

1128
01:37:45,166 --> 01:37:46,165
How dare you say that?

1129
01:37:46,958 --> 01:37:48,540
How can you accuse me
of such a motive?

1130
01:37:48,958 --> 01:37:50,749
l have travelled 12,000 miles
only out of concern for...

1131
01:37:51,541 --> 01:37:52,957
...Kaveriamma's well being.

1132
01:37:53,291 --> 01:37:55,082
lf you were so concerned

1133
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:57,874
then where were you when she
was in an Old Age Home?

1134
01:37:58,375 --> 01:38:00,040
lt was l who traced her
and got her here.

1135
01:38:00,958 --> 01:38:01,874
Maybe, that's because

1136
01:38:02,291 --> 01:38:07,749
you needed someone to take
care of Chikku and your house.

1137
01:38:11,958 --> 01:38:13,749
Why did you come back?

1138
01:38:15,458 --> 01:38:17,082
Why did you have to come back?

1139
01:38:19,541 --> 01:38:21,374
We were so happy.

1140
01:38:23,166 --> 01:38:25,040
You have everything in life.

1141
01:38:27,833 --> 01:38:31,749
But all we have is Kaveriamma.

1142
01:38:33,958 --> 01:38:36,040
You are not the only one
with a right over her.

1143
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:41,499
l agree that she is
like a mother figure to you...

1144
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:44,457
...and you like a son to her.

1145
01:38:44,958 --> 01:38:51,040
But she is a mother to me too.

1146
01:38:54,541 --> 01:38:58,749
l don't want to
become an orphan again!

1147
01:39:03,041 --> 01:39:04,374
l understand Gita.

1148
01:39:08,166 --> 01:39:10,665
l will not allow you to take
Kaveriamma away from me.

1149
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:17,957
Kaveriamma will come
with me to America.

1150
01:39:21,541 --> 01:39:24,749
Whether you like it... or not!

1151
01:39:49,166 --> 01:39:51,165
l'm in a dilemma Fatima.

1152
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:56,374
Mohan is asking me to go with him,
while Gita expects me to be here.

1153
01:39:56,541 --> 01:39:58,749
l just don't know what to do.

1154
01:39:58,958 --> 01:40:02,374
Allah knows, when Mohan arrived
l was so happy for you.

1155
01:40:02,541 --> 01:40:05,540
But l never thought things
would get into such a tangle.

1156
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:09,040
You'll have to disappoint
one or the other.

1157
01:40:09,458 --> 01:40:15,165
l'm not clear whether l should go to
America with Mohan or not!

1158
01:40:15,791 --> 01:40:21,540
l don't understand why he
wants to take you there?

1159
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:25,957
To work there? Did you ask him?

1160
01:40:26,958 --> 01:40:33,374
No Fatima. He loves me.
He'll take good care of me.

1161
01:40:33,625 --> 01:40:36,374
Well, l hope you are right Kaveri.

1162
01:40:37,083 --> 01:40:40,165
Otherwise who is to know what
tomorrow has in store?

1163
01:40:44,208 --> 01:40:48,374
Kaveri, why don't you ask
Mohan to stay on over here?

1164
01:40:49,375 --> 01:40:52,374
No Fatima, he won't agree.

1165
01:40:53,083 --> 01:40:54,957
Remember one thing...

1166
01:40:55,791 --> 01:40:59,624
...every piece of ice is inevitably
ordained to melt in its own water!

1167
01:40:59,958 --> 01:41:02,540
Get him to understand
this perfectly well.

1168
01:41:22,958 --> 01:41:23,874
We played a lot.

1169
01:41:26,958 --> 01:41:28,165
Kaveriamma...

1170
01:41:28,875 --> 01:41:31,165
...you can stop looking for a groom for me!

1171
01:41:32,250 --> 01:41:35,165
l have decided... not to get
married at this point!

1172
01:41:35,541 --> 01:41:36,749
But why?

1173
01:41:37,875 --> 01:41:43,874
Yes. l want to focus all my time on the
children and the school's progress.

1174
01:41:45,291 --> 01:41:47,749
That's alright, but...

1175
01:41:48,375 --> 01:41:51,165
Furthermore, l'm not yet prepared
for marriage!

1176
01:41:59,166 --> 01:42:02,165
Well done!

1177
01:42:03,041 --> 01:42:05,499
This is a good move
to stall Kaveriamma from leaving.

1178
01:42:08,041 --> 01:42:11,540
But then, come to think of it
who will want to marry you anyway?

1179
01:42:12,750 --> 01:42:15,165
Now, don't get me wrong!
l'm not saying you're not beautiful.

1180
01:42:15,666 --> 01:42:20,874
But this attitude, tonnes of
ideals and principles...

1181
01:42:21,541 --> 01:42:22,624
who'll suffer all this?

1182
01:42:23,958 --> 01:42:26,499
lt's a good thing, you have
decided to opt out yourself.

1183
01:42:27,750 --> 01:42:32,457
But there is one crazy guy,
who might want to marry you.

1184
01:42:47,291 --> 01:42:49,874
Yes Mohan, the precipitation
measurement list has been drawn up.

1185
01:42:50,083 --> 01:42:52,624
- You understand what l'm saying?
- Yes Vinod.

1186
01:42:53,375 --> 01:42:57,749
We've tested the dual frequency radar,
the horizontal & vertical resolution's fine

1187
01:42:57,958 --> 01:43:04,874
Yes, but the waveforms need to match
with the longitudinal parabolas.

1188
01:43:05,083 --> 01:43:06,957
Ofcourse, ofcourse
they work in alignment.

1189
01:43:07,541 --> 01:43:08,374
Nivaaranji... Nivaaranji...

1190
01:43:09,166 --> 01:43:11,165
- Here speak to Steve.
- Hi Mohan.

1191
01:43:11,541 --> 01:43:15,374
Steve, what about the
geometrical axis function?

1192
01:43:16,375 --> 01:43:20,957
lt's being calibrated. The baseline
parameter's been optimized.

1193
01:43:21,750 --> 01:43:26,874
See, the sun-synch orbit needs to be in
alignment with the radiometers of TRMM .

1194
01:43:28,166 --> 01:43:30,540
Ok, l'll make the remaining readings
and call you in a couple of days.

1195
01:43:30,750 --> 01:43:31,749
Ok, thanks.

1196
01:43:32,666 --> 01:43:36,040
Hey Mohan so how's everything else?

1197
01:43:36,458 --> 01:43:38,165
Everything's fine. All is well.

1198
01:43:39,083 --> 01:43:41,165
So, have you found yourself
a village belle?

1199
01:43:41,375 --> 01:43:42,499
Actually, you can say yes.

1200
01:43:42,750 --> 01:43:43,540
What?

1201
01:43:44,458 --> 01:43:46,540
- You're kidding me right?
- No.

1202
01:43:48,166 --> 01:43:50,040
What's her name?

1203
01:43:50,750 --> 01:43:53,957
Her name is Gita.
Kaveriamma lives with her.

1204
01:43:54,541 --> 01:43:56,040
l don't believe this!

1205
01:43:56,541 --> 01:43:58,374
Except, she's no village belle...

1206
01:43:58,750 --> 01:44:01,374
She studied in Delhi
and now she runs a school here.

1207
01:44:01,541 --> 01:44:02,374
Have you told her?

1208
01:44:02,958 --> 01:44:04,165
Does she know?

1209
01:44:06,041 --> 01:44:07,957
- How can l tell her?
- What do you mean?

1210
01:44:08,458 --> 01:44:09,290
l mean...

1211
01:44:10,541 --> 01:44:12,874
l mean she's got a different set
of ideals et al. She's just different.

1212
01:44:13,458 --> 01:44:18,874
Come on!
You can't make that mistake.

1213
01:44:19,458 --> 01:44:20,957
You have to tell her how you feel.

1214
01:44:21,375 --> 01:44:22,957
All right... if you say so.

1215
01:44:23,166 --> 01:44:25,374
Listen l'll catch up with you later,
gotta go now.

1216
01:44:25,541 --> 01:44:28,374
Your two weeks are almost up!

1217
01:44:28,875 --> 01:44:30,957
l know.

1218
01:44:31,541 --> 01:44:32,749
l'll be back soon.

1219
01:44:32,958 --> 01:44:36,082
- You should have been back already.
- But let me propose to her first.

1220
01:44:36,916 --> 01:44:39,374
l'll be leaving soon,
catch up with you later, bye.

1221
01:44:39,666 --> 01:44:40,540
Bye.

1222
01:44:43,041 --> 01:44:44,374
Gurnaamji, how much was that?

1223
01:44:48,125 --> 01:44:50,749
- 32 minutes. ls it ok if l pay tomorrow?
- Yes.

1224
01:44:51,375 --> 01:44:54,665
My apologies Mohanbabu!
The electricity is problematic here.

1225
01:45:27,958 --> 01:45:30,499
Why are you trying to
corrupt Chikku's mind?

1226
01:45:30,750 --> 01:45:32,374
What are you talking about?

1227
01:45:32,541 --> 01:45:36,374
Haven't you been talking to him and
his friends about going to America?

1228
01:45:36,541 --> 01:45:38,082
No Gita, l was just explaining...

1229
01:45:38,291 --> 01:45:42,665
Am l teaching these kids so that they can
go abroad and settle down like you?

1230
01:45:42,875 --> 01:45:44,874
You NRl. Non-Returning lndian!

1231
01:45:49,291 --> 01:45:51,040
Hand me the mug, please.

1232
01:45:53,041 --> 01:45:56,374
You don't even know how to have a bath.
You should learn from Chikku.

1233
01:45:56,541 --> 01:45:58,165
Gita, l think you need a vacation.

1234
01:45:58,375 --> 01:46:00,290
Why don't you come back
with me for one?

1235
01:46:02,958 --> 01:46:04,957
Gita, you are very mischievous.
Where's the bucket?

1236
01:46:05,166 --> 01:46:06,749
- Listen...
- No. You listen to me.

1237
01:46:06,958 --> 01:46:10,749
- What?
- l like you very much... Gitli!

1238
01:46:11,208 --> 01:46:13,457
- What?!
- lt's true, Gitli!

1239
01:46:13,666 --> 01:46:18,374
l liked the way you handled
that man in the bookshop.

1240
01:46:18,750 --> 01:46:23,374
Don't try to sweet talk me.
Kaveriamma will stay here... with me!

1241
01:46:23,541 --> 01:46:26,540
You're misunderstanding.
l really like you.

1242
01:46:26,750 --> 01:46:29,957
Shut up! And don't you try
to corrupt the kids again, ok?

1243
01:46:30,166 --> 01:46:32,957
l'm not corrupting anyone.
l'm only bathing.

1244
01:46:37,375 --> 01:46:39,540
More than the kids, you're the
one who needs an education!

1245
01:46:45,875 --> 01:46:47,749
You can keep calling out to
YOUR Kaveriamma now.

1246
01:47:03,375 --> 01:47:07,374
All right now, remove your notebooks.
The topic is General Knowledge.

1247
01:47:08,541 --> 01:47:09,499
So who's going to tell me...

1248
01:47:09,875 --> 01:47:13,665
...the names of five of the most
important rivers in the country?

1249
01:47:16,375 --> 01:47:17,749
l'm sorry to be late teacher.

1250
01:47:29,875 --> 01:47:30,540
Look ahead.

1251
01:47:36,166 --> 01:47:38,040
Today l'm going to take your class!

1252
01:47:40,958 --> 01:47:42,040
First question...

1253
01:47:42,875 --> 01:47:45,374
...name five main rivers in lndia?

1254
01:47:47,875 --> 01:47:48,749
You...

1255
01:47:50,833 --> 01:47:51,749
...tell me!

1256
01:47:54,250 --> 01:47:55,040
Let me think.

1257
01:47:57,958 --> 01:48:01,374
Ganga, Jamuna, Narmada...

1258
01:48:04,958 --> 01:48:05,957
...Bharati...

1259
01:48:08,250 --> 01:48:09,374
...Panchgani...

1260
01:48:09,541 --> 01:48:13,165
Bharati? Panchgani??
Are they rivers?

1261
01:48:15,666 --> 01:48:17,249
Vidya, you tell me.

1262
01:48:17,750 --> 01:48:22,165
Ganga, Jamuna, Narmada...
Godavari and Brahmaputra.

1263
01:48:27,166 --> 01:48:28,290
Excellent Vidya!

1264
01:48:30,541 --> 01:48:31,540
Second question...

1265
01:48:33,041 --> 01:48:37,374
...name the new state that has
been formed in North-West lndia?

1266
01:48:39,416 --> 01:48:43,082
l know this one.
lt was a part of Uttar Pradesh, right?

1267
01:48:48,166 --> 01:48:49,540
Yes Chikku. You tell us!

1268
01:48:49,958 --> 01:48:51,540
- lt's Uttaranchal!
- Oh yes, Uttaranchal!!

1269
01:48:51,750 --> 01:48:54,374
How could l have missed it?
l forgot!

1270
01:48:54,833 --> 01:48:55,749
Well done, Chikku!

1271
01:48:57,750 --> 01:48:59,290
Now the last question...

1272
01:48:59,875 --> 01:49:02,749
...if our new student does
not know the answer...

1273
01:49:03,958 --> 01:49:06,165
...we'll have to demote him to a lower class.

1274
01:49:23,166 --> 01:49:25,540
How many lion heads does
the Ashoka pillar have?

1275
01:49:30,750 --> 01:49:31,957
This one is easy.

1276
01:49:32,708 --> 01:49:33,540
Three.

1277
01:49:33,875 --> 01:49:36,499
Noooooo! lt's got four!

1278
01:49:39,541 --> 01:49:42,624
Excellent, children!
The lesson of the day is...

1279
01:49:42,833 --> 01:49:44,957
...before gaining knowledge
about foreign lands,

1280
01:49:45,291 --> 01:49:47,957
it is important that one should
know one's own country first.

1281
01:49:54,708 --> 01:49:56,290
Don't forget to do your homework.

1282
01:50:04,875 --> 01:50:07,832
The rivers Ganga and Jamuna have
their confluence point in Allahabad.

1283
01:50:08,833 --> 01:50:10,165
The new state Uttaranchal...

1284
01:50:10,958 --> 01:50:14,540
...is the 27th state of lndia
with Dehradun as its capital.

1285
01:50:14,750 --> 01:50:17,082
This is the land where the
Mahabharata was written!

1286
01:50:17,875 --> 01:50:20,165
The Ashoka pillar rests
in a circular abacus,

1287
01:50:20,375 --> 01:50:23,374
which is girded by four animals.
The bull of the West...

1288
01:50:24,041 --> 01:50:31,874
...the elephant of the East,
the horse of the South...

1289
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:33,957
...and lion by the North.

1290
01:50:38,750 --> 01:50:44,540
Gita, the blackboard is clean.

1291
01:50:52,750 --> 01:50:54,165
Gita... l am...

1292
01:50:58,958 --> 01:50:59,957
Gita...!

1293
01:51:04,708 --> 01:51:06,249
But all my answers were correct.

1294
01:51:07,125 --> 01:51:11,040
This is Natthu, the potter and
this is Shankar...

1295
01:51:11,250 --> 01:51:12,374
...he makes baskets.

1296
01:51:12,541 --> 01:51:16,540
Both of them want us to admit
their children in school.

1297
01:51:16,916 --> 01:51:20,040
What Mohanbabu said to us
the other day touched our hearts.

1298
01:51:20,291 --> 01:51:23,832
We don't want our
children to suffer like us.

1299
01:51:24,916 --> 01:51:27,249
On the morning of Dussehra
(lndian festival)

1300
01:51:27,458 --> 01:51:30,249
you can come and enroll your
children in the school.

1301
01:51:30,458 --> 01:51:31,415
Yes ok.

1302
01:51:36,208 --> 01:51:38,040
The tides have begun to
change direction.

1303
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:40,040
Haven't they?

1304
01:51:50,333 --> 01:51:51,415
l'm sorry.

1305
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:06,249
- Mohan!
- Yes?

1306
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:10,874
- Mohan, l have some work for you.
- What work?

1307
01:52:11,083 --> 01:52:13,582
There's a place called Kodi a
few miles from here.

1308
01:52:13,791 --> 01:52:16,332
Gita has some family property there,

1309
01:52:16,541 --> 01:52:19,165
which has been leased to a
farmer called Haridas.

1310
01:52:19,375 --> 01:52:21,832
He has not paid his rent for
some months.

1311
01:52:22,166 --> 01:52:23,624
l want you to go an
recover the money.

1312
01:52:24,083 --> 01:52:25,332
Me?

1313
01:52:26,750 --> 01:52:29,249
But why do you want me to go?
Can't you send someone else?

1314
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:32,790
lf you go and ask
he just might pay up.

1315
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,999
Oh! So you want me
to be a collector now!

1316
01:52:36,291 --> 01:52:40,540
Ok, when should l leave?
l have to fuel up the caravan.

1317
01:52:41,041 --> 01:52:43,040
- You have to leave now.
- Now?

1318
01:52:43,250 --> 01:52:46,915
- Yes, and you can't take the caravan there.
- Then?

1319
01:52:47,125 --> 01:52:49,540
You will have to take the train
for three hours to Narsinga...

1320
01:52:49,708 --> 01:52:51,832
...then a boat journey across
the river to Maangaon...

1321
01:52:52,083 --> 01:52:55,249
...and finally three hours by bus...
and you've reached Kodi!

1322
01:52:55,583 --> 01:53:00,499
- Sure, that's pretty closeby!
- You'll return by tomorrow evening.

1323
01:53:00,916 --> 01:53:04,957
And Mela Ram will go with you.
He knows the way.

1324
01:53:06,541 --> 01:53:08,540
- Kaveriamma...
- Yes?

1325
01:53:10,666 --> 01:53:14,665
My vacation is nearing it's end.
What have you decided?

1326
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,040
You finish this work first.

1327
01:53:25,375 --> 01:53:26,582
Come on Collector saheb...!

1328
01:53:31,500 --> 01:53:32,874
Why are you sending Mohan?

1329
01:53:33,083 --> 01:53:35,624
l sent Haridas a message only
a few days ago.

1330
01:53:37,083 --> 01:53:39,374
l know what l'm doing!

1331
01:53:48,791 --> 01:53:51,540
- Good morning sir.
- Good morning Melaram.

1332
01:53:51,750 --> 01:53:54,290
l'm all set to take you on a
sightseeing trip of the village.

1333
01:54:02,041 --> 01:54:03,332
Ok, l'll take your leave.

1334
01:54:03,708 --> 01:54:06,582
Mohanbhaiyya, you'll
bring me a toy, won't you?

1335
01:54:06,791 --> 01:54:09,999
Of course! Gimme five... yes!

1336
01:54:20,708 --> 01:54:23,124
And what shall l bring for you?

1337
01:54:24,125 --> 01:54:25,040
Nothing.

1338
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:32,207
l know you don't want me to leave,
but l have to go for Kaveriamma.

1339
01:54:33,541 --> 01:54:36,124
And listen, don't think
about me too much.

1340
01:54:37,250 --> 01:54:38,749
Don't miss me too much.

1341
01:54:39,750 --> 01:54:42,915
Now what makes you think
that l'll miss you?

1342
01:54:43,791 --> 01:54:44,874
The look in your eyes!

1343
01:54:47,416 --> 01:54:48,540
They give your feelings away.

1344
01:55:32,708 --> 01:55:35,624
O beloved, most beloved, surely

1345
01:55:35,833 --> 01:55:38,957
l am infatuated with thee

1346
01:55:39,166 --> 01:55:42,374
Thou hast endeared my heart

1347
01:55:42,541 --> 01:55:45,707
O beloved...

1348
01:55:49,416 --> 01:55:52,332
O beloved, most beloved, surely

1349
01:55:52,500 --> 01:55:55,624
l am infatuated with thee

1350
01:55:55,833 --> 01:55:59,040
Thou hast endeared my heart

1351
01:55:59,250 --> 01:56:02,374
O beloved...

1352
01:56:02,583 --> 01:56:05,624
My heart's bewildered

1353
01:56:05,833 --> 01:56:08,957
My body with fire kindled

1354
01:56:09,166 --> 01:56:12,374
lt's monsoon of my dreams

1355
01:56:12,541 --> 01:56:15,624
The courtyard of my eyes streams

1356
01:56:15,833 --> 01:56:19,165
The pitcher of my heart is overflowing

1357
01:56:19,375 --> 01:56:26,124
O beloved...

1358
01:57:02,791 --> 01:57:09,332
O dear who hast drawn so near!
O dear who hast endeared my heart!

1359
01:57:09,500 --> 01:57:16,540
How canst l recount

1360
01:57:17,791 --> 01:57:20,915
What hath been thy bequest pray how?

1361
01:57:21,125 --> 01:57:24,249
Somewhere art buds of
a throbbing heart

1362
01:57:24,416 --> 01:57:25,415
Somewhere the dream-lanes

1363
01:57:25,625 --> 01:57:27,374
Mirth that dwells in the heart,

1364
01:57:27,791 --> 01:57:30,290
How shallst l articulate?

1365
01:57:30,458 --> 01:57:33,624
Thou swayeth me so

1366
01:57:33,833 --> 01:57:38,040
That oft times l am embarrassed

1367
01:57:39,333 --> 01:57:42,290
lt seems l have lost
my path

1368
01:57:42,583 --> 01:57:48,999
Ever since l have seen the
haven of love

1369
01:57:49,208 --> 01:57:55,499
Haven of love

1370
01:57:55,916 --> 01:57:59,040
O beloved, most beloved,
surely

1371
01:57:59,250 --> 01:58:02,415
l am infatuated with thee

1372
01:58:02,583 --> 01:58:05,749
Thou hast endeared my heart

1373
01:58:05,958 --> 01:58:09,124
O beloved...

1374
01:58:46,791 --> 01:58:53,332
Now that thou hast met me
This world's transformed

1375
01:58:53,500 --> 01:58:59,957
Methinks the flowers have begun
to beset my path

1376
01:59:00,166 --> 01:59:06,582
And l fancy too
That this earth's renewed

1377
01:59:06,791 --> 01:59:13,415
The sky too freshly spun
in our love

1378
01:59:13,791 --> 01:59:17,124
Wanton breeze singeth some melody

1379
01:59:17,333 --> 01:59:22,415
River too narrates some tale

1380
01:59:22,583 --> 01:59:29,165
All's changed, my love
since my eyes courted thine

1381
01:59:29,375 --> 01:59:35,749
l have lost presence of my mind,
gone is my treasured selfhood

1382
01:59:35,958 --> 01:59:42,415
O beloved...

1383
01:59:58,625 --> 02:00:06,415
Haridasji!

1384
02:00:07,333 --> 02:00:08,124
Yes?

1385
02:00:14,083 --> 02:00:16,332
l'm Mela Ram and this is
Mohan Bhargavji.

1386
02:00:16,875 --> 02:00:17,707
Tell me.

1387
02:00:18,041 --> 02:00:22,915
Kaveriji and Gitaji have sent me.
lt's about the rent.

1388
02:00:25,041 --> 02:00:26,124
l understand.

1389
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,415
Come in.

1390
02:00:36,416 --> 02:00:41,374
You have travelled a long way.
You must be tired. Please rest.

1391
02:00:41,750 --> 02:00:43,915
Make some bread.

1392
02:00:44,833 --> 02:00:47,124
Run along now.

1393
02:00:48,083 --> 02:00:48,915
Please come in.

1394
02:01:06,916 --> 02:01:09,165
You really shouldn't have bothered.

1395
02:01:10,791 --> 02:01:14,707
How is that possible?
A guest is like God!

1396
02:01:15,708 --> 02:01:18,290
We've served what we have;
you eat and then we'll talk.

1397
02:01:19,625 --> 02:01:20,499
Ok.

1398
02:01:35,583 --> 02:01:39,374
lf l had the capacity to pay,
l would have come to Charanpur myself.

1399
02:01:40,625 --> 02:01:43,957
Sir, l was a weaver before l
took up farming.

1400
02:01:45,958 --> 02:01:47,957
Since the advent of machine
woven fabrics in the market,

1401
02:01:49,208 --> 02:01:50,915
weaving had ceased to
be a lucrative business.

1402
02:01:52,583 --> 02:01:57,290
So l became a farmer.
l took Gitaji's land on lease.

1403
02:01:58,791 --> 02:02:05,124
l'd imagined, once the crops flourished
the children's life would improve.

1404
02:02:07,125 --> 02:02:08,915
But it was not to be!

1405
02:02:10,958 --> 02:02:11,832
Why?

1406
02:02:13,250 --> 02:02:16,540
By taking up farming,
l had changed my profession.

1407
02:02:18,708 --> 02:02:23,707
The village elders did not accept this
and looked upon me as an outcast.

1408
02:02:25,958 --> 02:02:30,915
They felt a weaver should remain a weaver,
even if it meant, that he had to go hungry.

1409
02:02:33,041 --> 02:02:38,207
l cried, pleaded...
but no one listened to me!

1410
02:02:40,375 --> 02:02:44,415
Nobody offered a drop of
water to irrigate my land.

1411
02:02:46,875 --> 02:02:48,415
Entire crop dried up...

1412
02:02:49,916 --> 02:02:53,832
...and whatever survived,
the villagers refused to buy.

1413
02:02:55,791 --> 02:02:58,707
lt is because of this, l've not
been able to pay Gitaji's rent.

1414
02:03:00,916 --> 02:03:02,124
But this is wrong.

1415
02:03:05,250 --> 02:03:09,290
lt's unfair. lt is an outrage!

1416
02:03:10,250 --> 02:03:12,124
lt is the way things work here.

1417
02:03:14,500 --> 02:03:16,165
Not a morsel to
fill our stomach,

1418
02:03:17,458 --> 02:03:21,707
no clothes to wear,
no roof above our heads,

1419
02:03:23,041 --> 02:03:25,707
no education for children,
nor land!

1420
02:03:27,166 --> 02:03:32,707
The thirst in my heart alone
knows the taste of my tears!

1421
02:03:35,583 --> 02:03:36,915
Then what did you do?

1422
02:03:37,250 --> 02:03:38,415
What could l do?

1423
02:03:39,750 --> 02:03:43,707
l thought about migrating to the city,
hoping life would be better there.

1424
02:03:45,625 --> 02:03:48,499
Those who had been there,
recounted the anguish in the cities.

1425
02:03:50,208 --> 02:03:55,749
A labourer goes there to work,
and falls into the grip of contractors.

1426
02:03:57,583 --> 02:04:00,165
He either returns hungry,
or never returns.

1427
02:04:01,583 --> 02:04:08,124
And soon, the wife has to
sell the little land she has.

1428
02:04:09,750 --> 02:04:11,207
No sir, no!

1429
02:04:12,166 --> 02:04:16,040
l couldn't feed my
children in this life...

1430
02:04:18,250 --> 02:04:19,832
...what is to happen after me?

1431
02:04:21,166 --> 02:04:24,124
And about Gitaji's money,

1432
02:04:25,791 --> 02:04:30,915
l have nothing to offer
except helplessness and shame.

1433
02:04:32,458 --> 02:04:33,499
Nothing...

1434
02:04:50,666 --> 02:04:54,332
Thank you for the food, Haridasji.

1435
02:05:33,041 --> 02:05:34,332
Haridasji, l'll take your leave.

1436
02:05:40,416 --> 02:05:44,290
Please don't mind. Here's
some money. Keep it.

1437
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:49,124
Mohanbabu, it's very kind of you
but l can't accept it.

1438
02:05:49,750 --> 02:05:51,332
Please Haridasji, l want you to keep it.

1439
02:05:51,916 --> 02:05:54,290
When you have it, you can
return it to me.

1440
02:05:55,791 --> 02:05:58,707
But l don't know when l will
be able repay it.

1441
02:06:01,166 --> 02:06:02,374
Don't worry about it.

1442
02:06:04,583 --> 02:06:09,040
Here Chotu, this is for you.
Share it with your sisters.

1443
02:06:11,958 --> 02:06:17,040
Please give Gitaji
and Kaveriji my respects.

1444
02:07:51,416 --> 02:08:11,915
Water for sale... water for sale...
25 paise for a glass...

1445
02:08:12,333 --> 02:08:16,707
25 paise for a glass of water...

1446
02:08:17,916 --> 02:08:19,332
Saheb, please have a glass of water.

1447
02:10:15,916 --> 02:10:17,124
Mohan you're back!

1448
02:10:26,041 --> 02:10:27,374
How was your journey?

1449
02:10:28,916 --> 02:10:31,124
- Ok.
- Did you meet Haridas?

1450
02:10:32,125 --> 02:10:35,124
Yes. But l could not get the money.

1451
02:10:39,833 --> 02:10:44,457
His situation is pathetic.
He can't pay the rent!

1452
02:10:44,791 --> 02:10:47,915
lnstead, sir gave him money
from his own pocket, before leaving.

1453
02:10:50,750 --> 02:10:52,915
l couldn't bear to see
Haridas' condition.

1454
02:10:56,166 --> 02:10:58,332
l don't think you should expect
any rent from him.

1455
02:11:01,541 --> 02:11:03,415
Mohanbhaiyya, did you get me my toy?

1456
02:11:07,708 --> 02:11:08,999
l couldn't get anything.

1457
02:11:13,458 --> 02:11:14,415
Come Chikku.

1458
02:11:22,916 --> 02:11:25,707
Mohan this is the general
state of affairs.

1459
02:11:27,791 --> 02:11:31,249
What is money when compared
with the value of human life?

1460
02:11:33,041 --> 02:11:35,207
l'm glad you gave him money.

1461
02:11:36,750 --> 02:11:41,415
Now don't get disheartened.
Rest a little.

1462
02:11:56,750 --> 02:11:57,915
Kaveriammaaaa...

1463
02:11:59,666 --> 02:12:01,040
...how do l wrap this around?

1464
02:12:07,250 --> 02:12:09,915
Kaveriamma has left for school.
For the decorations.

1465
02:12:10,458 --> 02:12:13,415
l don't know why she wants
me to wear this dhoti?

1466
02:12:13,708 --> 02:12:15,457
What's wrong with my jeans anyway?

1467
02:12:15,666 --> 02:12:18,707
lt is the appropriate thing to
wear on Dussehra.

1468
02:12:19,166 --> 02:12:20,290
lf you wish l can tie it for you.

1469
02:12:20,458 --> 02:12:23,082
How do you know?
Have you ever worn one?

1470
02:12:23,375 --> 02:12:24,707
lt's not a saree, ok!

1471
02:12:25,125 --> 02:12:26,790
Ok then! Do it yourself.

1472
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,082
All right, all right.
Just do it quick.

1473
02:12:31,958 --> 02:12:32,749
Come...

1474
02:12:37,791 --> 02:12:38,624
Give...

1475
02:12:41,125 --> 02:12:41,915
Hold it.

1476
02:13:01,250 --> 02:13:02,124
What the...

1477
02:13:42,583 --> 02:13:43,707
There, it's done.

1478
02:13:48,083 --> 02:13:49,249
Sure, it's done...

1479
02:13:49,958 --> 02:13:53,540
...but l hope it doesn't
unravel in a crowd! Or else...

1480
02:13:53,750 --> 02:13:54,707
Shut up!

1481
02:13:57,541 --> 02:14:01,249
Today is the auspicious day of Dussehra.
lt was on this day that Lord Rama...

1482
02:14:01,416 --> 02:14:06,915
had slain Ravana and marked the
triumph of good over evil!

1483
02:14:07,125 --> 02:14:10,332
l am very happy that on this day
we initiate new students in the school.

1484
02:14:10,500 --> 02:14:13,540
May the Goddess of Knowledge
be with you.

1485
02:14:27,666 --> 02:14:28,624
lt's Lajwa.

1486
02:14:37,500 --> 02:14:40,040
This is our little granddaughter Kusum!

1487
02:14:45,166 --> 02:14:47,082
Now, go and play.

1488
02:14:52,166 --> 02:14:58,040
Mohanji, where are you off?
Why don't you spend some time with us?

1489
02:14:59,875 --> 02:15:03,249
l'm impressed. How well you've
tied your dhoti Mohanbabu?

1490
02:15:03,541 --> 02:15:05,165
How did you manage to learn so quickly?

1491
02:15:05,541 --> 02:15:08,124
lt's pretty easy. lt was tied in seconds.

1492
02:15:08,333 --> 02:15:09,915
You're looking like a bridegroom.

1493
02:15:12,833 --> 02:15:13,624
Thank you.

1494
02:15:13,875 --> 02:15:17,832
So how long have you lived abroad?

1495
02:15:18,333 --> 02:15:20,624
lt's been almost twelve years now.

1496
02:15:20,916 --> 02:15:23,790
You must have adapted yourself
completely to their way of living?

1497
02:15:25,375 --> 02:15:30,749
We would also like to know a
thing or two about America.

1498
02:15:31,625 --> 02:15:36,540
Well... America is a big country...

1499
02:15:36,875 --> 02:15:40,624
We've heard that it's also very rich?

1500
02:15:41,333 --> 02:15:44,582
Rich it is. But there are several
reasons for that.

1501
02:15:44,916 --> 02:15:49,540
One among them is that their land
is rich in mineral resources...

1502
02:15:49,791 --> 02:15:53,165
Even our land is rich, but in crops.

1503
02:15:53,583 --> 02:15:55,957
Our strength... lies in our fields.

1504
02:15:56,458 --> 02:15:58,624
Do they have problems of rain?

1505
02:15:58,833 --> 02:16:02,457
Are they affected by drought
and famine like us?

1506
02:16:02,666 --> 02:16:03,957
And what about electricity?

1507
02:16:08,250 --> 02:16:12,457
They've set up infrastructure to provide
all the basic amenities to the common man.

1508
02:16:12,666 --> 02:16:18,665
Electricity, housing board, healthy
food and free education.

1509
02:16:18,875 --> 02:16:26,249
We have one thing,
they don't have and will never have.

1510
02:16:28,041 --> 02:16:28,915
What?

1511
02:16:29,791 --> 02:16:32,082
Culture and tradition!

1512
02:16:32,291 --> 02:16:33,499
Yes, agreed.

1513
02:16:33,708 --> 02:16:39,582
And till we have that,
no one can destroy us.

1514
02:16:40,291 --> 02:16:43,832
Ours is the greatest country in the world!

1515
02:16:44,500 --> 02:16:45,415
Absolutely!

1516
02:16:45,625 --> 02:16:51,040
Culture and tradition is our strength,
don't you agree?

1517
02:16:55,041 --> 02:16:56,040
Munishwar...

1518
02:16:57,708 --> 02:17:02,457
l don't think... Mohanbabu agrees!

1519
02:17:02,833 --> 02:17:04,040
Do you Mohanji?

1520
02:17:05,250 --> 02:17:05,874
You're right.

1521
02:17:07,250 --> 02:17:09,957
l don't agree that ours is the greatest
country in the world!

1522
02:17:15,041 --> 02:17:20,332
But l do believe that we have the
potential and strength to become great.

1523
02:17:22,708 --> 02:17:27,707
Both these countries are economically,
sociologically and culturally apart.

1524
02:17:28,708 --> 02:17:33,124
l shouldn't say this but since you have
broached this topic, let me say that...

1525
02:17:34,166 --> 02:17:36,832
...whenever we suspect losing
in comparison...

1526
02:17:37,500 --> 02:17:39,165
...we clutch on to our favourite refuge...

1527
02:17:41,083 --> 02:17:42,040
...culture...

1528
02:17:42,833 --> 02:17:43,749
...and tradition!

1529
02:17:45,958 --> 02:17:47,415
America has progressed
on its own strengths.

1530
02:17:47,625 --> 02:17:49,874
They have their own culture
and own tradition.

1531
02:17:50,083 --> 02:17:53,332
lt would be wrong to claim
that their culture

1532
02:17:53,541 --> 02:17:56,374
their tradition and beliefs
are inferior and ours are laudable.

1533
02:17:57,708 --> 02:17:58,749
lt's wrong.

1534
02:18:00,750 --> 02:18:02,957
But l have heard that

1535
02:18:03,166 --> 02:18:09,082
there they discriminate against
members of ethnic races.

1536
02:18:09,291 --> 02:18:14,457
Yes! There are clashes sometimes.
Aren't they everywhere?

1537
02:18:14,666 --> 02:18:17,040
What is important to analyze is that
we make differences based on caste.

1538
02:18:19,833 --> 02:18:27,624
You talk as if we have created the caste,
class, religion and the social system.

1539
02:18:28,333 --> 02:18:32,124
This hierarchy of caste is ancient
as is culture and religion.

1540
02:18:33,166 --> 02:18:35,582
And colour and creed.

1541
02:18:35,916 --> 02:18:39,999
Remember, one's caste is
a thing that can never die!

1542
02:18:40,583 --> 02:18:43,040
Just because a custom is ancient,
it does not have to be right.

1543
02:18:45,083 --> 02:18:49,332
Why are you imposing your
views on us Mohanbabu?

1544
02:18:50,708 --> 02:18:52,332
l am not imposing any views.

1545
02:18:53,166 --> 02:18:56,999
l am only speaking of things l've
experienced while living here.

1546
02:18:58,333 --> 02:19:00,957
And l've realized that we keep
fighting amongst ourselves...

1547
02:19:01,166 --> 02:19:08,207
...when we must fight against illiteracy,
over-population and corruption.

1548
02:19:08,333 --> 02:19:11,415
Every day, in our streets and homes,
each one of us keeps saying

1549
02:19:11,625 --> 02:19:15,749
The country has gone to dogs. The
country is on the path of destruction!

1550
02:19:16,583 --> 02:19:20,624
lf we keep saying this, we will
one day actually land up there.

1551
02:19:20,916 --> 02:19:22,665
You'll need to do
something to remedy this.

1552
02:19:22,875 --> 02:19:24,249
You too!

1553
02:19:24,416 --> 02:19:26,874
Not just the members of the Panchayat
but everyone in the village.

1554
02:19:28,875 --> 02:19:32,290
You are blaming the members of the
Panchayat for your problems.

1555
02:19:32,458 --> 02:19:37,457
But when you step into their shoes, you'll
do the same thing. This applies to me too!

1556
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:40,249
The dalits blame the brahmins...

1557
02:19:40,416 --> 02:19:44,332
...and brahmins claim that their
piety is despoiled by the dalits.

1558
02:19:45,250 --> 02:19:48,374
The blacksmith and potter blame
the moneylender.

1559
02:19:49,708 --> 02:19:53,332
The land owners blame the peasants,
but they don't give them their rights.

1560
02:19:54,625 --> 02:19:57,040
ln what way are we great then?

1561
02:19:58,500 --> 02:20:00,790
lf we have problems in the village,
we point our finger at the State...

1562
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:05,832
...and the State at someone else.
We all are finding fault with each other!

1563
02:20:06,375 --> 02:20:09,665
The fact is that we're all to be blamed.

1564
02:20:10,916 --> 02:20:13,249
Because the problem... is us!

1565
02:20:13,666 --> 02:20:15,499
Me... you...

1566
02:20:16,958 --> 02:20:17,832
...all of us!

1567
02:20:19,250 --> 02:20:22,999
Have you lost your head?
What are you saying?

1568
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:25,624
All l know is that...

1569
02:20:26,916 --> 02:20:31,040
...a weaver who changed his
occupation by becoming a farmer...

1570
02:20:32,583 --> 02:20:35,207
...cannot feed his family

1571
02:20:38,083 --> 02:20:40,165
or give his children an education.

1572
02:20:41,750 --> 02:20:44,707
He can only watch his kids
die of malnutrition.

1573
02:21:33,750 --> 02:21:39,999
Every moment weighs terribly,
we're beset with a calamity

1574
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:47,332
O scion of Raghu race,
come to rescue me

1575
02:21:48,416 --> 02:21:52,957
Come, O Raghu stalwart,
O lord, l beseech thee

1576
02:21:53,166 --> 02:21:57,874
Adorable lord of my heart,
O my good Ram, appear

1577
02:21:58,083 --> 02:22:02,624
l recite thy Name,
hear thou O Ram and come

1578
02:22:02,833 --> 02:22:05,332
l recite thy Name,

1579
02:22:05,541 --> 02:22:09,332
hear thou O Ram and come

1580
02:22:09,541 --> 02:22:11,540
Proclaim glory of truth
by beat of drum,

1581
02:22:11,958 --> 02:22:13,749
burn Lanka of sins

1582
02:22:14,333 --> 02:22:19,207
At once come, rescue me and
heed loud proclamation mine

1583
02:22:19,375 --> 02:22:25,624
Every moment weighs terribly,
we're beset with a calamity

1584
02:22:26,541 --> 02:22:33,165
O scion of Raghu race,
come to rescue me

1585
02:22:43,333 --> 02:22:47,249
Forget Ram, look!
lt's Ravana who hast come

1586
02:22:47,833 --> 02:22:52,040
His mighty shadow hath
spread over all quarters

1587
02:22:52,708 --> 02:22:58,082
Why dost thou recite Name of Ram?
Why dost thou sing rosary of Ram?

1588
02:22:58,916 --> 02:23:03,082
This 'Ram' 'Ram' thou hast
begun by rote

1589
02:23:03,375 --> 02:23:05,374
O Sita!

1590
02:23:05,583 --> 02:23:08,999
what virtue didst thou
see in Ram to quote?

1591
02:23:09,750 --> 02:23:13,749
Who can recount all His virtues?

1592
02:23:13,958 --> 02:23:18,624
Lexicon too falleth short

1593
02:23:19,375 --> 02:23:23,332
Who can reach the summits

1594
02:23:23,541 --> 02:23:28,332
Where my adorable Ram sits

1595
02:23:28,958 --> 02:23:33,499
Ram is most excellent in this world,
unswerving in virtue

1596
02:23:33,708 --> 02:23:38,082
Most puissant yet
possessed of restraint

1597
02:23:38,291 --> 02:23:42,499
But now his restraint too
hath suffered diminution

1598
02:23:42,708 --> 02:23:47,249
O Ravana! lt's not too
late to beg for mercy!

1599
02:23:47,791 --> 02:23:49,749
May the glory of truth be
proclaimed by beat of drum!

1600
02:23:50,333 --> 02:23:52,082
Lanka of sins shouldst burn

1601
02:23:52,625 --> 02:23:54,832
Here cometh Ram; we bow unto Him

1602
02:23:55,041 --> 02:23:57,582
Accompanied by noble
brother Lakshmana

1603
02:23:57,791 --> 02:24:03,790
Every moment weighs terribly,
we're beset with a calamity

1604
02:24:04,958 --> 02:24:14,457
O scion of Raghu race,
come to rescue me

1605
02:24:18,708 --> 02:24:22,707
Shouldst Ram possess strength;
shouldst He valour proclaim

1606
02:24:22,916 --> 02:24:26,957
Why hast He not come to rescue thee,
thy fame?

1607
02:24:27,166 --> 02:24:31,207
He whose glories thou
singeth untiring

1608
02:24:31,375 --> 02:24:35,665
Pray, where is that Ram at
this moment, uncaring?

1609
02:24:52,333 --> 02:24:56,332
Ram resides in mine heart;
Ram is mine breathing part

1610
02:24:56,541 --> 02:25:01,957
Ram is soul mine,
Ram doth my life define

1611
02:25:02,791 --> 02:25:06,749
Ram in all my moments liveth,
it's Ram in every breath

1612
02:25:06,958 --> 02:25:11,624
Ram is in every hope of mine;
Ram is in every wish and pine

1613
02:25:15,375 --> 02:25:19,499
Ram verily in compassion stayeth,
in peace too dwelleth Ram

1614
02:25:19,708 --> 02:25:24,040
Ram for sure in unity is,
progress too is glory His

1615
02:25:25,833 --> 02:25:29,915
Ram, in contemplation of devotees,
and of enemies alike liveth

1616
02:25:30,125 --> 02:25:34,165
Forsake sin, O Ravana! And thou
shalt find Ram in thy heart

1617
02:25:34,333 --> 02:25:42,499
Ram in thy heart,
Ram is in mine heart

1618
02:25:42,708 --> 02:25:46,665
Ram in every home and abode,
Ram at every threshold

1619
02:25:46,875 --> 02:26:02,332
Whoever shouldst oust Ravana
from the heart, to him doth Ram dart

1620
02:26:12,791 --> 02:26:19,040
Every moment weighs terribly,
we're beset with a calamity

1621
02:26:20,083 --> 02:26:27,415
O scion of Raghu race,
come to rescue me

1622
02:26:36,166 --> 02:26:41,207
Look Lord Ram has come,
Mine Lord Ram has come

1623
02:26:41,375 --> 02:26:45,957
Here comes the scion of the Raghu race,
Here he comes to rescue me

1624
02:26:46,166 --> 02:26:50,624
Look Lord Ram has come,
Mine Lord Ram has come

1625
02:26:50,833 --> 02:27:04,749
Here comes the scion of the Raghu race,
Here he comes to rescue me

1626
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:11,665
Siyavar Ramchandra Ki... Jai
(Glory unto Lord Ramchandra)

1627
02:28:30,708 --> 02:28:33,165
The burning Ravan is looking
prettier in the darkness.

1628
02:28:55,333 --> 02:29:13,540
Every moment weighs terribly,
we're beset with a calamity

1629
02:29:13,750 --> 02:29:16,290
Quiet! Please be quiet!

1630
02:29:18,291 --> 02:29:19,624
Why do l feel that...

1631
02:29:20,625 --> 02:29:23,374
...all of you have started
enjoying living in this darkness?

1632
02:29:24,250 --> 02:29:25,874
You've adjusted to this darkness?

1633
02:29:27,416 --> 02:29:32,332
For how long are you'll going to
take your problems lying down?

1634
02:29:34,583 --> 02:29:36,915
But what else can we do, Mohanji?

1635
02:29:37,875 --> 02:29:39,957
Will you do as l ask?

1636
02:29:40,583 --> 02:29:44,082
Have you once again come up
with some strange solution?

1637
02:29:44,458 --> 02:29:46,249
Please have mercy on us!

1638
02:29:48,375 --> 02:29:49,582
Wait Munishwar...

1639
02:29:50,750 --> 02:29:51,957
What do you want us to do?

1640
02:29:52,875 --> 02:29:54,665
ls there a spring on
the nearby mountain?

1641
02:29:55,250 --> 02:29:57,040
Yes there is. So?

1642
02:29:57,583 --> 02:29:59,082
l need a hundred men.

1643
02:29:59,958 --> 02:30:01,165
A hundred men?

1644
02:30:02,291 --> 02:30:03,332
You shall have them.

1645
02:30:04,833 --> 02:30:06,874
You shall have a
hundred men!

1646
02:30:07,791 --> 02:30:08,874
Thank you Dadaji.

1647
02:30:12,791 --> 02:30:15,582
Sir, one hears lightning had struck
this spot several years ago.

1648
02:30:15,791 --> 02:30:17,582
Since then there has been
this gush of water.

1649
02:30:43,208 --> 02:30:45,124
Wonder what he's upto!

1650
02:30:48,833 --> 02:30:53,624
This is Point A1

1651
02:30:56,916 --> 02:30:59,499
We shall build a reservoir here.

1652
02:31:00,375 --> 02:31:02,374
l mean a water tank.

1653
02:31:02,583 --> 02:31:04,624
The water will be
acccumulated here.

1654
02:31:05,458 --> 02:31:09,249
From here, there will be a water pipe
which leads to Point A3.

1655
02:31:10,500 --> 02:31:15,415
A3 will have a shed with a turbine,
l mean a machine.

1656
02:31:15,833 --> 02:31:19,832
When the water falls on the turbine,
it will rotate with great speed.

1657
02:31:20,291 --> 02:31:24,624
And if all things go right,
electricity will be generated.

1658
02:31:30,916 --> 02:31:32,040
We'll form four groups.

1659
02:31:32,208 --> 02:31:35,249
The blacksmiths will cast the moulds.

1660
02:31:35,458 --> 02:31:39,165
The 2nd and 3rd group will do the
digging work for the tank and so on.

1661
02:31:39,375 --> 02:31:42,124
Now let's form the groups.

1662
02:31:42,416 --> 02:31:43,249
Fast!

1663
02:31:44,083 --> 02:31:47,374
This boy looks promising!

1664
02:31:47,833 --> 02:31:49,124
Surely seems like.

1665
02:31:49,958 --> 02:31:54,082
Reservoir will be made here.
Length 5 metres and breadth 1 metre.

1666
02:31:54,250 --> 02:31:55,749
l mean, 5 arm's length
by 1 arm's length.

1667
02:31:55,958 --> 02:31:58,624
For this we will have to clear out
all the stones and bushes.

1668
02:31:58,833 --> 02:32:00,790
- ls that clear?
-Yes.

1669
02:32:13,875 --> 02:32:16,832
lt's 7 feet and 6 inches.

1670
02:32:53,833 --> 02:32:54,749
Shall l try it?

1671
02:33:21,916 --> 02:33:22,832
Where's Mela Ram?

1672
02:33:25,958 --> 02:33:29,415
- What is this?
- From boot to suit, total American sir!

1673
02:33:31,875 --> 02:33:33,165
But why?

1674
02:33:33,375 --> 02:33:34,999
Now that we are going to do
business together...

1675
02:33:35,166 --> 02:33:37,332
l thought that l should look
like a 40% partner!

1676
02:33:40,500 --> 02:33:43,374
This is my passport and this is
my VlSA form, fully filled out!

1677
02:33:43,583 --> 02:33:45,332
Once it's stamped...

1678
02:33:59,458 --> 02:34:01,540
Baloo, show him an
alternator powered 24 watts.

1679
02:34:01,750 --> 02:34:03,374
Please come in sir.

1680
02:34:34,125 --> 02:34:37,832
- Here's your water, Dadaji.
- Thank you, Santaram.

1681
02:34:38,500 --> 02:34:41,040
How's the work progressing on the hill?

1682
02:34:41,125 --> 02:34:42,290
lt's getting on perfectly fine.

1683
02:34:42,500 --> 02:34:45,374
- How long will it take?
- lt will be completed very soon.

1684
02:34:45,583 --> 02:34:46,832
You take rest!

1685
02:34:51,125 --> 02:34:54,749
l'll take your leave now.
Jai Ramji Ki!

1686
02:35:06,875 --> 02:35:10,499
By the way Vinod, will the turbine
principle work in power generation?

1687
02:35:11,333 --> 02:35:13,665
Yes. Why do you ask?

1688
02:35:13,875 --> 02:35:17,540
You know what, l am trying to
generate electricity here.

1689
02:35:18,041 --> 02:35:20,457
Electricity? What the hell
are you talking about?

1690
02:35:21,666 --> 02:35:24,124
No no Vinod l'm lighting a bulb here.

1691
02:35:25,541 --> 02:35:27,957
John is beginning to lose it by the day.

1692
02:35:28,125 --> 02:35:29,957
Speak to him, and
buy me some more time.

1693
02:35:30,125 --> 02:35:32,957
- We've started working nights.
- Common Vinod handle it for me.

1694
02:35:33,125 --> 02:35:34,540
l'll talk to you later.

1695
02:35:34,750 --> 02:35:35,749
- Bye.
- Bye.

1696
02:35:46,333 --> 02:35:54,207
- 25 X 75 is equal to...
- 1875.

1697
02:36:04,750 --> 02:36:09,457
23.3 X 33.9

1698
02:36:15,541 --> 02:36:19,540
789.87 = 790.

1699
02:36:48,541 --> 02:36:51,957
l'm about to finish this.

1700
02:37:06,041 --> 02:37:07,624
l've fallen in love with you.

1701
02:37:19,458 --> 02:37:22,624
What did you say? Come again.

1702
02:37:35,541 --> 02:37:39,332
See! Just see!

1703
02:37:39,666 --> 02:37:44,874
lt's you and me, and long solitude!

1704
02:37:45,125 --> 02:37:49,332
See! Just see!

1705
02:37:49,541 --> 02:37:54,749
How delicate are these shadows!

1706
02:37:55,083 --> 02:37:59,540
Listen in; heed the heartbeats

1707
02:37:59,833 --> 02:38:04,332
Listen in; heed the song of silence

1708
02:38:04,666 --> 02:38:14,082
Listen in; heed what the night hath to say

1709
02:38:14,208 --> 02:38:16,540
Night's come;

1710
02:38:16,750 --> 02:38:18,874
with desires nameless and many

1711
02:38:19,125 --> 02:38:23,665
She narrateth a hundred woes;
l listen to her epiphany

1712
02:38:23,875 --> 02:38:28,332
Night unwindeth,
unabashed stripeth her cloak

1713
02:38:28,541 --> 02:38:33,124
Pearls, scattered as it were; l pick

1714
02:38:35,541 --> 02:38:39,540
You have chanted some spell in words

1715
02:38:39,750 --> 02:38:44,374
Lamps are alit in my eyes

1716
02:38:45,125 --> 02:38:48,832
You have chanted some spell in words

1717
02:38:49,041 --> 02:38:54,249
The darkness of my nights hath poured out

1718
02:38:59,250 --> 02:39:01,957
- Melaram ready?
- Ready sir.

1719
02:39:02,125 --> 02:39:03,457
Release the valve.

1720
02:39:10,125 --> 02:39:11,540
Release the value further.

1721
02:39:17,333 --> 02:39:18,332
Good!

1722
02:39:48,166 --> 02:39:50,957
The water will gush to this
turbine through this pipe.

1723
02:39:51,125 --> 02:39:53,207
The turbine will rotate with
the force of water.

1724
02:39:54,250 --> 02:39:57,665
With this steering wheel,
we can control the water flow.

1725
02:39:58,250 --> 02:40:01,124
We need to release enough water
to make this pulley rotate

1726
02:40:01,333 --> 02:40:06,957
and make this alternator spin
at the speed of 1500 rpm.

1727
02:40:08,125 --> 02:40:10,540
And if this happens,
electricity will be generated.

1728
02:40:13,958 --> 02:40:17,124
Lonely wert the day and nights
sans you,

1729
02:40:17,333 --> 02:40:21,874
overcast with desolation

1730
02:40:23,458 --> 02:40:26,957
And now it seemeth the nights,
kissed by the day art perfumed

1731
02:40:27,125 --> 02:40:31,749
for you art my companion

1732
02:40:33,416 --> 02:40:42,749
l was incomplete sans you,
more complete now none couldst be

1733
02:40:43,375 --> 02:40:52,540
ln yours, my world l discovered,
yet l am all lost

1734
02:40:52,750 --> 02:40:57,290
Both of us have now learned,
art of living well earned

1735
02:40:57,541 --> 02:41:01,499
Like Midas touch, our living
how well hath altered

1736
02:41:02,125 --> 02:41:06,749
Both of us have now learned,
beauty of life well earned

1737
02:41:11,875 --> 02:41:16,749
O joys, we owneth a score,
enough and more

1738
02:41:46,458 --> 02:41:47,624
What are you'll doing?

1739
02:41:49,458 --> 02:41:53,332
There will be electricity in
your house, Dadi Setu!

1740
02:42:00,541 --> 02:42:04,832
The wires are up. Now all that
we have to do is wait.

1741
02:42:06,250 --> 02:42:09,707
- Ready...
- Ready sir.

1742
02:42:15,833 --> 02:42:16,624
Nivaaranji ok?

1743
02:42:16,833 --> 02:42:17,540
Yes Mohanji.

1744
02:42:18,291 --> 02:42:21,249
- Mela Ram, release the water.
- Ok sir.

1745
02:42:28,750 --> 02:42:29,624
Open the valve...

1746
02:42:30,541 --> 02:42:33,040
Slowly...

1747
02:43:13,708 --> 02:43:15,249
Electricity will be generated at 230 Volts.

1748
02:43:55,625 --> 02:43:57,124
Come on...

1749
02:44:17,166 --> 02:44:20,040
- Nivaaranji, is the valve fully open?
- Yes Mohanbabu.

1750
02:44:26,125 --> 02:44:29,540
Mela Ram, is the valve fully open?

1751
02:44:30,958 --> 02:44:33,832
Fully open sir. Totally open.

1752
02:44:34,041 --> 02:44:35,749
- Sure?
- Sure Sir.

1753
02:44:40,833 --> 02:44:43,624
Gita, Come.
Hold the stick.

1754
02:44:44,833 --> 02:44:45,624
Hold it.

1755
02:45:05,833 --> 02:45:07,457
lf the valve is fully open,
how come there's no pressure?

1756
02:46:00,958 --> 02:46:02,374
Has the pressure increased?

1757
02:46:02,625 --> 02:46:03,249
Yes!

1758
02:46:29,041 --> 02:46:31,124
Jafarbhai, how many rpm?

1759
02:46:35,125 --> 02:46:36,124
800 sir.

1760
02:47:08,250 --> 02:47:10,707
l say, how long now for the electricity?

1761
02:47:11,041 --> 02:47:13,457
Have patience Munishwar, patience!

1762
02:47:51,458 --> 02:47:52,457
Electricity!

1763
02:48:09,250 --> 02:48:10,249
Electricity.

1764
02:48:38,708 --> 02:48:41,374
Mohanbabu, we have done it.

1765
02:48:41,833 --> 02:48:45,374
Electricity of our own village!
Generated with our toil and sweat.

1766
02:48:46,041 --> 02:48:49,957
Just like this project, we must
think of newer and innovative ways

1767
02:48:50,166 --> 02:48:51,624
to solve our village's problems.

1768
02:48:51,833 --> 02:48:59,832
Sarpanchji, come quickly!
Dadaji's health has deteriorated.

1769
02:49:14,708 --> 02:49:15,582
Dadaji...

1770
02:49:19,625 --> 02:49:23,999
Electricity? ls it here?

1771
02:49:24,208 --> 02:49:24,957
Yes.

1772
02:49:31,250 --> 02:49:32,249
The day...

1773
02:49:33,250 --> 02:49:34,457
...l saw you...

1774
02:49:36,125 --> 02:49:37,124
...l felt...

1775
02:49:39,041 --> 02:49:42,832
...something special about you...

1776
02:49:51,458 --> 02:49:53,040
Now that you're here...

1777
02:49:55,375 --> 02:49:56,124
...l can...

1778
02:49:57,958 --> 02:50:01,374
die in peace.

1779
02:51:13,041 --> 02:51:16,457
But Mohan, you've alreaby been away
for five weeks. This really isn't right. .

1780
02:51:17,041 --> 02:51:20,832
l'm extremely sorry John. l've just been
caught up with some personal work and...

1781
02:51:21,041 --> 02:51:26,040
We are in Phase l l of Core design here.
There can't be any further delays!

1782
02:51:26,250 --> 02:51:29,832
l understand John. l've just finished
what l needed to do here and

1783
02:51:31,166 --> 02:51:32,624
l'll be back in three days.

1784
02:51:33,458 --> 02:51:37,540
- Three days it is!
- Of course John. Yes... l will.

1785
02:52:00,833 --> 02:52:04,165
What surprises me is how you
can think of going

1786
02:52:04,375 --> 02:52:06,957
after all that you have seen
and learnt here.

1787
02:52:07,958 --> 02:52:08,957
lt's true Gita.

1788
02:52:09,958 --> 02:52:12,457
l have learnt so much here,
gained so much here.

1789
02:52:13,375 --> 02:52:14,832
Felt the problems here...

1790
02:52:16,958 --> 02:52:18,374
...but l cannot live here.

1791
02:52:19,833 --> 02:52:21,707
And l cannot live out of this country.

1792
02:52:25,041 --> 02:52:26,749
l am willing to marry you...

1793
02:52:28,250 --> 02:52:29,832
...but l won't go to America.

1794
02:52:52,250 --> 02:52:54,249
l know that you are not going to
come with me.

1795
02:52:56,041 --> 02:52:57,749
Mohan, l've given it lot of thought.

1796
02:52:57,958 --> 02:53:06,707
At this age, l'll not be able to adopt the
ways and customs of another country.

1797
02:53:08,041 --> 02:53:11,457
l am happy here.

1798
02:53:14,250 --> 02:53:15,832
Now that you are leaving...

1799
02:53:20,041 --> 02:53:28,832
...l will miss you very much.

1800
02:53:32,125 --> 02:53:35,832
lf you were here, our family
would have been complete.

1801
02:54:07,250 --> 02:54:08,124
l'll take your leave.

1802
02:54:08,708 --> 02:54:09,624
May you live a long life son!

1803
02:54:12,375 --> 02:54:15,165
We had forgotten that you were a guest.

1804
02:54:16,041 --> 02:54:18,749
A visitor must leave one day.

1805
02:54:26,458 --> 02:54:28,332
We'll miss you very much.

1806
02:54:31,833 --> 02:54:33,124
When you come here next

1807
02:54:33,833 --> 02:54:38,040
you'll surely find lnternet
in Charanpur Post Office.

1808
02:54:38,250 --> 02:54:40,249
Every little lad will email you.

1809
02:54:41,458 --> 02:54:44,249
What we couldn't have,
is our wrestling match.

1810
02:54:49,833 --> 02:54:53,624
l am sorry Mela Ram that
l have to leave suddenly.

1811
02:54:53,916 --> 02:54:57,249
But l'll surely send you
the sponsorship papers.

1812
02:54:58,625 --> 02:55:01,124
l don't need them anymore.
l'll be fine here.

1813
02:55:03,041 --> 02:55:07,040
Your presence in the village has
changed some things around here.

1814
02:55:07,250 --> 02:55:08,957
Some things have definitely changed.

1815
02:55:09,750 --> 02:55:12,040
But you had planned your migration.

1816
02:55:14,041 --> 02:55:17,040
When the creeper in your house crosses
into your neighbor's compound...

1817
02:55:17,250 --> 02:55:18,624
...one's own house is ruined.

1818
02:55:19,375 --> 02:55:25,457
lt's like a lamp on your threshold
giving light to the neighbour's house.

1819
02:55:26,541 --> 02:55:27,624
All the best Sir.

1820
02:55:29,541 --> 02:55:30,624
Thank you Mela Ram.

1821
02:55:44,041 --> 02:55:46,582
Mohanbhaiyya, this is for you.

1822
02:55:54,958 --> 02:55:56,332
l will put this up in my house.

1823
02:55:57,041 --> 02:56:00,124
Listen, study well. Right!

1824
02:56:21,458 --> 02:56:22,457
Where is Gita?

1825
02:56:23,041 --> 02:56:25,457
l haven't seen her around since morning.

1826
02:56:28,250 --> 02:56:29,457
l have to leave now.

1827
02:56:30,041 --> 02:56:32,624
- Or else l'll miss my flight.
- Ok.

1828
02:56:33,541 --> 02:56:34,624
Please explain to her, ok?

1829
02:56:38,625 --> 02:56:46,707
Go son! My love and blessings
are always with you.

1830
02:56:53,250 --> 02:56:56,124
Dont worry...

1831
02:57:04,041 --> 02:57:05,457
Bye.

1832
02:58:00,625 --> 02:58:01,832
Gita, you're impossible!

1833
02:58:02,541 --> 02:58:03,624
You're here and...

1834
02:58:05,041 --> 02:58:07,040
...l've been looking for you all over.

1835
02:58:09,125 --> 02:58:11,707
l did not want to talk to you
before the villagers.

1836
02:58:14,041 --> 02:58:15,915
l'm saddened with your decision

1837
02:58:17,958 --> 02:58:20,165
but l can understand your predicament.

1838
02:58:21,541 --> 02:58:22,832
l can understand.

1839
02:58:25,625 --> 02:58:28,540
Gita, l too understand...

1840
02:58:30,541 --> 02:58:34,374
...but please don't mistake
my helplessness for betrayal.

1841
02:58:35,541 --> 02:58:38,249
- l did not mean to hurt you...
- Mohan.

1842
02:58:40,041 --> 02:58:41,374
l love you.

1843
02:58:42,958 --> 02:58:45,832
l want you to be happy wherever you are.

1844
02:58:49,250 --> 02:58:50,457
This is for you.

1845
02:58:54,750 --> 02:58:55,832
What is this?

1846
02:58:56,375 --> 02:58:57,124
Open it.

1847
02:59:06,541 --> 02:59:07,540
What's all this?

1848
02:59:10,458 --> 02:59:12,540
The summation of all our traditions!

1849
02:59:14,041 --> 02:59:16,124
Little flowers of our profound faith!

1850
02:59:18,333 --> 02:59:19,457
Our fields...

1851
02:59:20,250 --> 02:59:21,624
...our greenery...

1852
02:59:22,250 --> 02:59:23,040
...rivers...

1853
02:59:24,041 --> 02:59:25,582
our culture...

1854
02:59:30,250 --> 02:59:32,707
...all these will keep reminding you of us!

1855
02:59:34,250 --> 02:59:35,332
And maybe...

1856
02:59:37,333 --> 02:59:39,957
...maybe compel you to return!

1857
03:00:54,541 --> 03:00:56,457
Please stop! Don't go!

1858
03:01:58,375 --> 03:02:04,582
And as we can see, we have some points
here that the satellite travels

1859
03:02:04,791 --> 03:02:09,374
along the way to capture data
of the Global Precipitation.

1860
03:02:09,583 --> 03:02:13,457
Next we're going to see the territory
of the GPM instrument,

1861
03:02:13,791 --> 03:02:18,707
as it goes from Australia to lndia

1862
03:03:18,458 --> 03:03:21,790
This country, thy soil

1863
03:03:22,375 --> 03:03:25,790
lt's thy motherland!

1864
03:03:26,375 --> 03:03:31,790
She calls thee

1865
03:03:33,958 --> 03:03:39,582
This is a bond that can
never be severed

1866
03:03:47,500 --> 03:03:50,957
The scent of the soil:

1867
03:03:51,375 --> 03:03:54,874
How canst thou fail to remember?

1868
03:03:55,291 --> 03:04:02,582
No matter where thou wanderest
Thou art bound to return

1869
03:04:02,875 --> 03:04:06,582
From newer paths thou toureth

1870
03:04:06,791 --> 03:04:13,957
From thy sighs hushed.

1871
03:04:14,375 --> 03:04:15,957
From thy forlorn heart

1872
03:04:16,166 --> 03:04:17,374
Some one shalt beckon

1873
03:04:17,583 --> 03:04:20,457
This country, thy soil

1874
03:04:21,166 --> 03:04:24,374
lt's thy motherland!

1875
03:04:25,083 --> 03:04:29,790
She calls thee

1876
03:04:29,958 --> 03:04:35,457
This is a bond that can
never be severed

1877
03:04:58,291 --> 03:05:01,790
To thee hast thy life

1878
03:05:02,166 --> 03:05:05,582
Words to proclaim

1879
03:05:06,041 --> 03:05:09,374
Thou hast gained all

1880
03:05:09,875 --> 03:05:13,165
What dearth to name hath thou?

1881
03:05:13,708 --> 03:05:16,957
All the happiness hath
showered, though:

1882
03:05:17,166 --> 03:05:20,582
Thou art far away from thy home

1883
03:05:20,958 --> 03:05:24,790
Come, return O wanderer

1884
03:05:24,958 --> 03:05:28,957
Where someone
wouldst name thou a kin

1885
03:05:29,166 --> 03:05:36,165
And summon thee to the native soil

1886
03:05:36,375 --> 03:05:39,165
This country, thy soil

1887
03:05:40,166 --> 03:05:43,582
ls thy motherland!

1888
03:05:44,083 --> 03:05:48,790
She calls thee

1889
03:05:48,958 --> 03:05:54,582
This is a bond that can
never be severed

1890
03:05:54,791 --> 03:06:01,374
Now that you're here...
l can... die in peace!

1891
03:06:01,583 --> 03:06:06,040
lt is like a lamp on your threshold
giving light to your neighbor's house.

1892
03:06:06,958 --> 03:06:10,165
l've made up my mind, Vinod.
l must go back.

1893
03:06:11,958 --> 03:06:12,957
Not again!

1894
03:06:13,791 --> 03:06:17,582
How can you go back for a girl?
Just persuade her to come here.

1895
03:06:17,791 --> 03:06:18,874
lts not that Vinod!

1896
03:06:19,375 --> 03:06:21,457
lt's not only about
Gita and Kaveriamma.

1897
03:06:25,166 --> 03:06:28,582
This is the moment decreed

1898
03:06:28,791 --> 03:06:31,874
ln which concealeth

1899
03:06:32,791 --> 03:06:35,874
Full eon

1900
03:06:36,541 --> 03:06:39,874
entire existence

1901
03:06:40,041 --> 03:06:47,582
Don't thou dare ask why roads two
Cross thy path through

1902
03:06:47,791 --> 03:06:55,165
Thou art the one to resolve the road
Thou art the one to discern the code

1903
03:06:55,375 --> 03:07:02,957
Which direction? Whither dost the
path leadeth to true abode?

1904
03:07:03,166 --> 03:07:05,957
This country, thy soil

1905
03:07:06,958 --> 03:07:10,790
lt's thy motherland!

1906
03:07:11,958 --> 03:07:17,374
She calls thee

1907
03:07:17,583 --> 03:07:23,165
This is a bond that can never be severed

1908
03:07:23,375 --> 03:07:24,374
l got it.

1909
03:07:26,583 --> 03:07:27,582
Just because you lit a bulb

1910
03:07:27,791 --> 03:07:29,874
now you have delusions of sparking
a revolution in the whole country.

1911
03:07:34,958 --> 03:07:36,582
You're being foolishly romantic!

1912
03:07:40,375 --> 03:07:41,790
Let's leave aside sentiments...

1913
03:07:42,166 --> 03:07:43,957
Have you figured out what you are
going to do there?

1914
03:07:45,791 --> 03:07:47,457
- l have a few ideas.
- Like?

1915
03:07:49,375 --> 03:07:54,165
l could be a Project Manager for
Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre.

1916
03:07:54,791 --> 03:07:56,957
l can... l can work in tandem
with NASA from there.

1917
03:07:57,958 --> 03:07:59,374
There's a lot to be done there.

1918
03:07:59,958 --> 03:08:02,957
You're impossible.
l can't understand you!

1919
03:08:04,958 --> 03:08:07,290
lf you can't understand
even after hearing all this...

1920
03:08:09,166 --> 03:08:10,457
...then its pointless telling you anything.

1921
03:08:12,708 --> 03:08:14,499
You'll have to come there and see things.

1922
03:08:16,458 --> 03:08:18,290
Otherwise you'll never understand!

1923
03:08:39,166 --> 03:08:44,165
We're just a few minutes away from the
launch of the GPM Spacecraft

1924
03:08:44,583 --> 03:08:45,957
on an important scientific mission to

1925
03:08:46,166 --> 03:08:48,957
better understand the global water
cycle here on earth.

1926
03:08:51,583 --> 03:08:55,790
GPM will allow improvements in
predicting precipitation forecasts,

1927
03:08:55,958 --> 03:08:58,040
and better predict flood hazards.

1928
03:08:58,500 --> 03:09:02,165
We are not tracking any technical
problems at this time.

1929
03:09:02,375 --> 03:09:05,790
All systems are GO on the launch vehicle.

1930
03:09:05,958 --> 03:09:08,457
Weather forecast is very good for today.

1931
03:09:10,166 --> 03:09:14,582
Just a few minutes away from
launching the GPM spacecraft.

1932
03:09:14,791 --> 03:09:17,957
This spacecraft will give us information...

1933
03:09:18,166 --> 03:09:20,957
that will help us better predict precipitation

1934
03:09:21,583 --> 03:09:29,165
ln addition, we can better predict flood hazards.

1935
03:09:30,416 --> 03:09:32,582
T minus 20 secs.

1936
03:09:46,375 --> 03:09:48,582
T minus 15 secs.

1937
03:09:51,791 --> 03:09:58,165
T minus 10-9-8-7-6

1938
03:09:58,375 --> 03:10:01,165
We have a GO for main engine start

1939
03:10:01,958 --> 03:10:06,165
3-2 booster ignition...

1940
03:10:08,708 --> 03:10:10,582
...and Lift-Off!!

1941
03:11:01,375 --> 03:11:03,374
John l tried to knock some
sense into his head

1942
03:11:03,583 --> 03:11:05,582
and tried to convince him
not to leave but...

1943
03:11:08,958 --> 03:11:11,707
Mohan, you do realize
what you are going to lose.

1944
03:11:12,291 --> 03:11:15,790
John, l know what
l'm going to gain.

1945
03:11:16,958 --> 03:11:20,290
But you're aware, you could
have gone places.

1946
03:11:22,583 --> 03:11:24,165
l am going places!

1947
03:11:28,958 --> 03:11:32,582
All right Mohan go light your bulb!

1948
03:12:31,708 --> 03:12:33,874
Nobody has ever thrown me like this.

1949
03:12:34,375 --> 03:12:36,374
Where did you learn
these wrestling tricks, Mohanbabu?

1950
03:12:36,791 --> 03:12:39,165
Where there is a will, there is a way.

1951
03:12:40,291 --> 03:12:43,457
Afterall, a marshmelon changes its colour
in company of another marshmelon!

1952
03:12:44,583 --> 03:12:45,582
Do you understand now?

1953
03:12:51,375 --> 03:12:53,165
Excellent match, Mohanbabu.
