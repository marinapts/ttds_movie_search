00:00:48,807 --> 00:00:50,559
What?

2
00:00:50,687 --> 00:00:54,919
I said I just wanted to talk.

3
00:00:56,167 --> 00:00:58,681
What the hell?

4
00:00:59,607 --> 00:01:02,041
What's with the way you
fucking talk?

5
00:01:02,167 --> 00:01:04,806
Who the fuck are you?

6
00:01:11,647 --> 00:01:14,605

8
00:01:18,487 --> 00:01:22,480
Oh Daesu.

9
00:01:23,007 --> 00:01:25,601
Why are you picking on
someone else's girlfriend?

10
00:01:25,727 --> 00:01:27,445
Hold on.

11
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:30,445
Mister Daesu!
- Am I picking on you?

12
00:01:31,247 --> 00:01:33,715
Okay, I got it!

13
00:01:37,927 --> 00:01:41,363
Oh Daesu,
please sit down.

14
00:01:43,367 --> 00:01:46,200
Oh boy,
must have drunk a lot.

15
00:01:46,327 --> 00:01:49,444
Hold on, let me piss first!

16
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,683
I didn't do anything!

17
00:01:52,087 --> 00:01:53,236
You son o f a bitch!

18
00:01:53,367 --> 00:01:55,005
We have to do something about him.

19
00:01:55,127 --> 00:01:58,199
- Asshole!
- Sit down!

20
00:01:58,407 --> 00:02:03,117
I'm very sorry.
Fuck, I gotta piss bad.

21
00:02:04,007 --> 00:02:07,044
- Cute, huh?
- Yeah, I saw it. Now go sit down.

22
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:09,840
Today's my daughter's birthday.

23
00:02:09,967 --> 00:02:13,118
I got her a present
for her birthday.

24
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,720
Snatches o f clouds floating
in the sky

25
00:02:16,847 --> 00:02:19,884
A pleasure boat
floats in the river

26
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:23,283
My name, Oh Daesu, means...

27
00:02:24,247 --> 00:02:29,241
"Getting along with people"
That's why I'm Oh Daesu.

28
00:02:30,647 --> 00:02:33,207
But, shit...

29
00:02:33,327 --> 00:02:38,003
Why can't I get along today?
Set me free!

30
00:02:40,487 --> 00:02:44,082
- Shut the hell up!
- Set me free!

31
00:03:01,647 --> 00:03:03,399
Let go o f me, damn it!

32
00:03:03,527 --> 00:03:06,280
That son o f a bitch really
needs some prison time.

33
00:03:06,407 --> 00:03:09,479
- Get away from me!
- Hey, get him!

34
00:03:14,767 --> 00:03:18,362
I'll make sure he doesn't get drunk
and cause more trouble.

35
00:03:18,487 --> 00:03:23,197
- Have a nice day, o fficer.
- He's usually a nice guy.

36
00:03:23,327 --> 00:03:24,601
Let's go.

37
00:03:24,727 --> 00:03:28,766
- I'll visit you soon.
- We don't want you to come back.

38
00:03:28,887 --> 00:03:31,959
That's up to me, assholes.

39
00:03:32,447 --> 00:03:33,766
Hey!

40
00:03:35,647 --> 00:03:42,086
My sweet pea, it's daddy.
Daddy got my sweet pea a present.

41
00:03:42,447 --> 00:03:45,917
I'll be home soon with your gift,
so wait a bit longer.

42
00:03:46,047 --> 00:03:48,561
- Let me talk to her.
- Good girl, good.

43
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,245
Give me the phone.

44
00:03:50,367 --> 00:03:53,757

45
00:03:53,887 --> 00:03:56,606

00:03:57,167 --> 00:04:01,046
Hello, hi, Yeun hee.

So today's your birthday?
Happ y birthday.

48
00:04:07,207 --> 00:04:09,846
I'll treat you to something
nice tomorrow.

49
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:16,122
Hello? Hi, Ja hyun. I'm sorry.
I know it's very late.

50
00:04:16,247 --> 00:04:20,001
Daesu is on his way now.
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:23,278
Yes? Hold on.
Daesu, it's your wife.

52
00:04:23,407 --> 00:04:25,921
Daesu!

53
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:30,561
Daesu!

54
00:04:36,287 --> 00:04:38,517
Daesu!

55
00:04:46,447 --> 00:04:50,122
Hey, Daesu!
Couldn't you hurry up a bit.

56
00:04:50,487 --> 00:04:53,047
Hey, stop fooling around
and let's go.

57
00:04:57,647 --> 00:04:59,285
Daesu!

58
00:05:52,567 --> 00:05:54,603
Sir, wait. Come here.

59
00:05:55,527 --> 00:05:57,085
Wait, talk to me.

60
00:05:57,207 --> 00:06:00,756
I won't tell you to let me go.

61
00:06:00,887 --> 00:06:04,880
Just tell me why I'm here, okay?

62
00:06:05,007 --> 00:06:08,079
I should know the reason at least.

63
00:06:08,207 --> 00:06:10,960
Shit, I've been locked up here
for two months already.

64
00:06:11,087 --> 00:06:13,555
Sir, wait, come here.

65
00:06:14,247 --> 00:06:17,284
What place is this?

66
00:06:17,407 --> 00:06:21,002
Sir, just tell me how long
I have to stay in here.

67
00:06:21,607 --> 00:06:27,284
Sir! Fuck you!
Come here, you asshole!

68
00:06:27,927 --> 00:06:30,964
I saw your face, asshole.

69
00:06:31,887 --> 00:06:35,766
You're dead if I get out.
Come here, asshole.

70
00:06:36,327 --> 00:06:39,239
I'm sorry, I won't curse.

71
00:06:39,367 --> 00:06:44,282
Just tell me.
One month, two, or three?

72
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:48,284
Hey, where are you going?

73
00:06:49,847 --> 00:06:52,315
Just tell me how long,

You asshole!
You son o f a bitch!

00:07:02,407 --> 00:07:06,798
If they had told me
it w as going to be 15 y ears

76
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:10,886
could it have been easier to endure?

77
00:07:11,127 --> 00:07:13,482
0 r could it have not?

78
00:07:14,927 --> 00:07:18,681
"Laugh, and the world laughs
with you. Cry, and you cry alone."

79
00:07:24,367 --> 00:07:27,882
When the melody turns on
gas comes out.

80
00:07:35,927 --> 00:07:39,806
When the gas comes
I fall aslee p.

81
00:07:44,167 --> 00:07:49,161
I found out later that it's the s ame
Valium-gas Russian soldiers used

82
00:07:49,287 --> 00:07:52,359
on the C hec hen terrorists.

83
00:07:59,807 --> 00:08:02,605
When I w ake u p

84
00:08:02,727 --> 00:08:05,605
I don't like my sty le really.

85

But they c hange my c lothes
and c lean the place u p.

86
00:08:12,327 --> 00:08:14,522
Grateful bastards.

87

88
00:08:19,607 --> 00:08:22,280

90
00:08:25,487 --> 00:08:27,682
It's too spicy.

91
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,275
I don't want spinach.
You eat it.

92
00:08:30,407 --> 00:08:33,763
I won't eat spinach.
I don't want to eat it.

93
00:08:34,687 --> 00:08:38,043
Kim Jahy un's body w as found
dee ply stabbed in the nec k.

94
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:40,681
Seeing that it w as a cold

95
00:08:40,807 --> 00:08:42,877
w ith nothing v aluable stolen

96
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:48,001
police sus pect that
the motive w as out of hatred.

97
00:08:48,567 --> 00:08:53,516
Her husband w ho dis appeared
a y ear ago is a prime sus pect.

98
00:08:54,047 --> 00:09:00,043
According to w itnesses, her
husband, 0 h Daesu,

99
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:04,479
drank often
c ausing trouble w ith his w ife.

100
00:09:04,607 --> 00:09:08,282
Neighbours s ay they
fou ght frequently.

101
00:09:08,407 --> 00:09:11,922
Blood s amples found at the scene
matc hed 0 h Daesu's.

102
00:09:12,047 --> 00:09:15,403
Fingerprints found on a c u p
also matc hed 0 h Daesu's.

103
00:09:15,927 --> 00:09:20,125
It w as confirmed by sources that
0 h Daesu visited his w ife recently.

104
00:09:20,247 --> 00:09:23,205
The stolen family album
also bac ks their theories.

105
00:09:52,727 --> 00:09:55,878
After three y ears

106
00:09:56,007 --> 00:09:58,567
many w rinkles
have formed on his face.

107
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:10,637
If y ou stand aimlessly

108
00:10:10,767 --> 00:10:13,884
at the phone booth
on a rainy day

109
00:10:14,007 --> 00:10:17,920
and meet a man w hose face is
covered by a violet umbrella

110
00:10:18,047 --> 00:10:22,757
I'd su ggest
that y ou get c lose to the TV.

111
00:10:23,447 --> 00:10:26,325
The TV is both a c loc k
and c alendar.

112
00:10:26,447 --> 00:10:28,802
It's y our sc hool, home,

113
00:10:28,927 --> 00:10:32,397
c hurc h, friend

114
00:10:32,927 --> 00:10:34,918
and lover.

115
00:10:35,207 --> 00:10:37,038
But...

116
00:10:57,607 --> 00:10:59,404
But...

117
00:10:59,527 --> 00:11:02,883
my lover's song

118
00:11:03,007 --> 00:11:05,282
is too short.

119
00:11:12,207 --> 00:11:14,767
This morning around 7:30
the to p 50m of

120
00:11:14,887 --> 00:11:18,596
the Sungsoo Bridge in Seoul

121
00:11:18,847 --> 00:11:22,476
I w rote dow n all the peo ple

122
00:11:22,607 --> 00:11:26,043
w hom I fou ght w ith,
bothered, and hurt.

123
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,918
This w as both
my prison journal

124
00:11:31,047 --> 00:11:34,244
and autobio graphy of
my evil deeds.

125
00:11:35,847 --> 00:11:39,203
I thou ght I have lived
an average life

126
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:44,686
but I've sinned too muc h.

127
00:11:50,687 --> 00:11:54,805
All I thou ght about
at that moment

128
00:11:54,927 --> 00:12:00,126
w as that the guy ne xt door
probably ate w ith one c ho pstic k.

129
00:12:01,367 --> 00:12:03,483
But.

130
00:12:04,607 --> 00:12:07,121
But...

131
00:12:13,407 --> 00:12:15,477
Who w ould've imprisoned me?

132
00:12:16,647 --> 00:12:18,365
Was it Yoo Heung s am?

133
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:21,524
Lee So y oung or Kang C hangsuk?

134
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,685
Whoever it w as, just w ait.

135
00:12:24,807 --> 00:12:26,843
Wait a bit more.

136
00:12:27,487 --> 00:12:29,637
I'll rip y our w hole
body apart

137
00:12:29,767 --> 00:12:33,965
and no one w ill be able to
find y our body any w here.

138
00:12:34,647 --> 00:12:37,684
Bec ause I'm going to
c hew it all dow n.

00:12:59,647 --> 00:13:02,241
0 ne line for one y ear.

00:13:02,927 --> 00:13:07,000
I have to sew six lines.

141
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:11,718
I guess the ne xt y ear w ill be easier.

142
00:13:12,687 --> 00:13:16,202
The more the tattoos
the shorter the c ho pstic k.

143
00:13:17,887 --> 00:13:22,085
The shorter the c ho pstic k
the bigger the w all's hole gets.

144
00:13:23,687 --> 00:13:25,917
Any w ay

145

00:15:46,127 --> 00:15:49,642
Even if I fall to my death
I'm still getting out.

175
00:15:49,767 --> 00:15:53,840
I'm getting out.
In one month.

176
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:24,077
Right now

177
00:16:24,207 --> 00:16:27,040
you're ly ing on a plain.

178
00:16:28,247 --> 00:16:31,284
When you hear the bell

179
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:35,878
you will turn your head
and look down.

180
00:16:39,127 --> 00:16:44,440
You will see
an endless field o f green grass.

181
00:16:45,847 --> 00:16:48,998
The sun is shining bright

182
00:16:49,127 --> 00:16:52,119
and there's a cool breeze.

183
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:48,036
It's a human being.

184
00:17:50,007 --> 00:17:52,521
Don't stop me!

185
00:18:32,407 --> 00:18:34,443
Mister.

186
00:18:34,687 --> 00:18:41,001
Even though
I'm no worst than a beast

187
00:18:43,087 --> 00:18:47,683
don't I have the right to live?

188
00:18:51,967 --> 00:18:53,844
Mister.

189
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,764
Even though

190
00:18:55,887 --> 00:19:01,405
I'm no worst than a beast

191
00:19:04,327 --> 00:19:10,038
don't I have right to live?

192
00:19:12,647 --> 00:19:14,877
Yes.

193
00:19:36,367 --> 00:19:38,756
That phone booth alley
w as just there.

194
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:41,879
Now there's an apartment building

195
00:19:42,007 --> 00:19:46,080
So he throw s me on the roof.
What a numskull.

196
00:19:47,367 --> 00:19:51,679
I want to tell you my story.
Delay your death.

197
00:19:51,807 --> 00:19:54,082
What?

198
00:20:01,087 --> 00:20:04,045
I see.

199
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,560
Of course.

200
00:20:10,687 --> 00:20:14,362
Now I'll tell you my story.

201
00:20:16,687 --> 00:20:21,442
The reason why I want to die.

202
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:26,478
Hey!

203
00:20:30,367 --> 00:20:33,279
It's a w oman being.

204
00:20:47,047 --> 00:20:50,926
That lunatic... Hurry!

205
00:20:53,287 --> 00:20:56,120
Hey! Come over here!

206
00:21:00,047 --> 00:21:04,563

208
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,157
My home is gone.

209
00:21:15,287 --> 00:21:18,836
I c an't c all either
my friends or relatives

210
00:21:18,967 --> 00:21:22,676
since I'm the one
w ho murdered my w ife.

211
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:27,281
Since I'm a fu gitive.

212
00:21:51,567 --> 00:21:53,398
You dickshit!

213
00:22:04,247 --> 00:22:06,442
Dic kshit.

214
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:09,798
Never heard of it

215
00:22:09,927 --> 00:22:13,681
since the TV
doesn't teac h y ou c urse w ords.

216

223
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,925
What's this smell?

224
00:23:11,887 --> 00:23:15,562
Don't even think about asking
me any questions.

225
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:19,077
I don't know a thing.

226
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:37,437
Yes?

227
00:23:38,287 --> 00:23:43,407
I said I want something alive.

228
00:23:45,647 --> 00:23:48,719
Oh, right.

229
00:23:49,007 --> 00:23:50,599
Long time no see.

230
00:23:50,727 --> 00:23:52,843
This is my first time.

231
00:23:52,967 --> 00:23:54,195
Maybe not?

232
00:23:54,327 --> 00:23:56,887
But she looks familiar.

233
00:23:57,767 --> 00:24:01,043
You look very familiar.

234
00:24:01,167 --> 00:24:02,566
Have I seen you somewhere?

235
00:24:02,687 --> 00:24:05,599
"Searching for the best che f"

236
00:24:05,727 --> 00:24:09,003
"On channel 11
every Thursday at 6:30"

237
00:24:09,127 --> 00:24:12,005
"The youngest female che f o f
Japanese food"

238
00:24:12,127 --> 00:24:13,242
Oh that...

239
00:24:13,367 --> 00:24:16,325
They said the ratings are low
but I guess it's popular.

240
00:24:16,447 --> 00:24:19,723
Women's hands are usually warm
so they can't make sushi.

241
00:24:19,847 --> 00:24:23,237
Wow, you sure know a lot!

242
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:38,044
Who are you?

243
00:24:39,767 --> 00:24:43,919
Do y ou like y our c lothes?

244
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:51,920
Why...

245
00:24:52,607 --> 00:24:56,839
- Why did you imprison me?
- Who do y ou think I am?

246
00:24:57,767 --> 00:25:00,201
- Yoo Heungsam? - Wrong.

247
00:25:00,327 --> 00:25:03,876
- Did Lee Soyoung hire you?
- No, w rong again.

248
00:25:04,007 --> 00:25:05,884
Lee Jongyong?

249
00:25:06,007 --> 00:25:07,804
Kang Changsuk?

250
00:25:07,927 --> 00:25:11,920
Hwang Jooyeun?
Kim Nasung? Park Ji woo?

251
00:25:12,047 --> 00:25:15,960
Lm Duksoon? Lee Jaep yung?
Kuk Suran? Who the hell are you?

252
00:25:16,087 --> 00:25:19,716
Me?
I'm sort of a sc holar.

253
00:25:19,847 --> 00:25:22,236
And my ma jor is y ou.

254
00:25:22,367 --> 00:25:26,918
A sc holar study ing 0 h Daesu.
An e xpert on 0 h Daesu.

255
00:25:27,247 --> 00:25:31,843
Who I am isn't important.
Why is important.

256
00:25:31,967 --> 00:25:35,562
Think it over.
Review y our w hole lifetime.

257
00:25:35,687 --> 00:25:40,807
Since y our sc hool is over it's time
for y our homew ork. Right?

258
00:25:40,927 --> 00:25:43,157
Kee p this in mind

259
00:25:43,287 --> 00:25:45,482
"Be it a grain of s and or roc k,

260
00:25:45,607 --> 00:25:48,963
in w ater they sink as the s ame"

261
00:25:49,087 --> 00:25:51,237
Let me ask you one thing.

262
00:25:51,367 --> 00:25:56,157
You hypnotized me in there
didn't you?

263
00:25:56,287 --> 00:25:58,881
What did you do to me?

264
00:25:59,007 --> 00:26:03,000
I miss y ou.
Hurry, and come to me.

265
00:26:13,567 --> 00:26:16,320
Here you are.

266
00:26:18,927 --> 00:26:21,122
It's alive, right?

267
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:24,957
I'll slice it up now.

268
00:26:58,487 --> 00:27:03,083
I must be a different breed o f
women. My hands are very cold.

269
00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:07,358
What's w ith her?

270
00:27:10,687 --> 00:27:12,882
Sir.

271
00:27:13,887 --> 00:27:16,720
Wake up, sir!

272
00:27:16,847 --> 00:27:19,281
Kee p this in mind.

273
00:27:19,407 --> 00:27:23,161
Be it a grain of s and or roc k,

274
00:27:23,287 --> 00:27:27,166
in w ater they sink as the s ame.

275
00:27:33,127 --> 00:27:36,164
Are you awake?

276
00:27:44,687 --> 00:27:47,042
Is this true?

277
00:28:06,567 --> 00:28:11,322
That fever remedy
really works.

278
00:28:12,207 --> 00:28:15,722
Why'd you faint
if you trained so much?

279
00:28:15,847 --> 00:28:22,525
A lack o f needed sunlight
depletes you o f vitamins A and E.

280
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:26,642
So I'm not immune to influenza.

281
00:28:27,927 --> 00:28:31,283
Do you usually talk that way?

282
00:28:42,527 --> 00:28:45,678
That bathroom door
is broken and doesn't lock.

283
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:49,846
Don't get any bright ideas
or I'll slice you like sushi.

284
00:28:50,807 --> 00:28:54,277
- What's this? - Suppositories.

285
00:28:54,407 --> 00:28:58,286
How else could I feed you
medicine if you fainted?

286
00:29:11,927 --> 00:29:15,806
C an imaginary training
for 15 y ears be put to use?

287
00:29:23,607 --> 00:29:26,280
It c an't.

288
00:29:40,287 --> 00:29:42,926
That was very bad o f me.

289
00:29:45,927 --> 00:29:50,717
After bringing you here
and rejecting you,

290
00:29:50,847 --> 00:29:53,566
I understand why you're mad.

291
00:29:53,687 --> 00:29:56,155
I do.

292
00:29:58,287 --> 00:30:02,917
I brought you here
because I like you, too.

293
00:30:03,047 --> 00:30:05,561
But.

294
00:30:06,727 --> 00:30:11,847
You don't even know my name.
I'm Mido.

295
00:30:12,487 --> 00:30:14,842
You see.

296
00:30:14,967 --> 00:30:20,166
Later,
when I'm really ready,

297
00:30:20,687 --> 00:30:24,475
I swear on my life that I will
give my self to you.

298
00:30:24,927 --> 00:30:29,000
That song, "The Face I miss"
in your diary that's the sign.

299
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:34,281
When I sing it,
then you get yourself ready.

300
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:39,919
When it actually happens.

301
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:42,959
I could resist again
at the heat o f the moment.

302
00:30:43,087 --> 00:30:45,920
But no matter what
don't ever back out.

303
00:30:46,047 --> 00:30:49,198
Just give it to me!

304
00:30:50,887 --> 00:30:54,926
Give it... to me?

305
00:31:00,847 --> 00:31:03,122
The ants.

306
00:31:03,447 --> 00:31:06,837
Do you still see them?

307
00:31:09,047 --> 00:31:12,722
Do you still feel that way?

308
00:31:13,567 --> 00:31:17,958
Yeah, if you're alone
you see the ants.

309
00:31:19,687 --> 00:31:22,155
Very lonely people
that I met

310
00:31:22,287 --> 00:31:25,723
they all hallucinated ants
at one time.

311
00:31:25,847 --> 00:31:29,635
After I thought about it.
Ants move around in groups.

312
00:31:29,767 --> 00:31:32,839
So I guess very lonely people
keep thinking about ants.

313
00:31:32,967 --> 00:31:34,400
Even though I never did.

314
00:32:33,727 --> 00:32:36,605
She called from overseas
five or six years ago

315
00:32:36,727 --> 00:32:39,764
asking if her dad
showed up.

316
00:32:39,887 --> 00:32:43,323
She doesn't even know
that he killed her mother.

317
00:32:43,447 --> 00:32:48,157
Since she has few
relatives she calls us.

318
00:32:48,287 --> 00:32:51,563
Her Korean has gotten bad.

319
00:32:52,247 --> 00:32:56,001
I think her foster parents
are both doctors.

320
00:32:58,167 --> 00:33:00,965
Anyhow, Miss Reporter

321
00:33:01,087 --> 00:33:06,957
Daesu really hasn't been caught yet?

322
00:33:11,127 --> 00:33:14,915
Your daughter's address
is on the front

323
00:33:15,047 --> 00:33:18,244
and on the back is a map
to your wife's grave.

324
00:33:20,327 --> 00:33:24,081
Ev a. Stoc kholm.

325
00:33:24,207 --> 00:33:26,562
Ev a.

326
00:33:26,687 --> 00:33:29,520
Do you want to call her?

327
00:33:34,647 --> 00:33:37,525
Want me to call her?

328
00:33:42,127 --> 00:33:45,483
Wanna go to the grave together?

329
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:55,117
No, a fter I kill that bastard first.

330
00:34:20,087 --> 00:34:21,964
"Blue Dragon"

331
00:34:24,007 --> 00:34:26,157
Is it right?

332
00:34:26,367 --> 00:34:29,165
I haven't c hew ed it y et.

333
00:34:33,767 --> 00:34:35,962
Blue Dragon, so?

334
00:34:36,887 --> 00:34:39,082
Is that the taste?

335
00:34:50,487 --> 00:34:54,400
Be it 10 or 100 restaurants,
it doesn't matter.

336
00:34:55,527 --> 00:35:00,317
I c an never forget that taste
for 15 y ears, Blue Dragon.

337
00:35:25,967 --> 00:35:29,482
Want me to make you
an ID to log in?

338
00:35:29,607 --> 00:35:32,519
Do you have a favorite
movie or song?

339
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:36,403
I talked to him.

340
00:35:46,047 --> 00:35:49,596
The Count o f Monte Cristo?

341
00:35:49,927 --> 00:35:54,796
There's no one
by that name here.

342
00:36:04,047 --> 00:36:07,084
How's life in a bigger prison,
0 h Daesu?

343
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:09,675
Who are you?

344
00:36:15,887 --> 00:36:18,765
The lonely prince in the high tow er.
Don't forget me.

345
00:36:18,887 --> 00:36:21,003
Who's this bastard?

346
00:36:24,927 --> 00:36:28,522
I don't know him.
I just chat with him sometimes.

347
00:36:38,647 --> 00:36:40,877
Where are you going?

348
00:36:47,527 --> 00:36:51,486
- Where are you going?
- I can't trust you.

349
00:37:08,207 --> 00:37:11,836
Magic Blue Dragon!
What could that mean?

350
00:37:25,567 --> 00:37:28,957
Why the hell did they order
from a restaurant this far aw ay?

351
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:33,081
I've gone by five
C hinese restaurants already.

352
00:37:34,407 --> 00:37:38,002
My lungs feel like e xploding.

353
00:37:43,567 --> 00:37:48,846
Tell your cooks to put
less scallions in the dumplings.

354
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:51,442
Sure.

355
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:03,522
- Set it down and go. - Okay.

356
00:38:38,927 --> 00:38:42,761
We don't work on anyone
being protected by body guards.

357
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:45,924
There are other people
who specialize in that.

358
00:38:46,047 --> 00:38:48,436
You can hire them.

359
00:38:48,567 --> 00:38:51,764
We work just on the small fries.

360
00:38:52,047 --> 00:38:56,040
If it's over six months
transportation fee is free.

361
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,203
Yes, o f course.

362
00:39:04,567 --> 00:39:08,719
Why'd you lock me up, you...

363
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:11,566
Dickshit.

364
00:39:12,007 --> 00:39:17,843
In our 7,5 floor business our
client's info is top secret.

365
00:39:36,087 --> 00:39:39,762
I'm going to pay
you back for all 15 year.

366
00:39:39,887 --> 00:39:43,960
Each one I y ank out
will make you age one year.

367
00:39:58,527 --> 00:40:00,279
Stay still.

368
00:40:07,007 --> 00:40:09,441
Ready to talk?

369
00:40:29,367 --> 00:40:31,562
I don't know.

370
00:40:31,687 --> 00:40:33,962
I didn't see his face.

371
00:40:34,487 --> 00:40:36,478
I recorded it.

372
00:40:40,887 --> 00:40:42,923
"Oh Daesu"

373
00:40:57,247 --> 00:41:00,762
AB blood type raise your hand.

374
00:41:12,447 --> 00:41:15,883
Go, he lost a lot o f blood.

375
00:44:36,687 --> 00:44:41,477
As e xpected,
I c an't get along today either.

376
00:44:42,807 --> 00:44:47,403
I've now become a monster.

377
00:44:47,887 --> 00:44:53,678
When my vengeance is over,
c an I return as the old Daesu?

378
00:44:58,527 --> 00:45:03,043
Mister, are you alright?
Look at all this blood!

379
00:45:03,607 --> 00:45:07,282
Mister, what happened to you?

380
00:45:12,487 --> 00:45:14,876
Saewoon Apartments in Eung am,
building 8.

381
00:45:15,007 --> 00:45:16,918
Please take care o f him.

382
00:45:17,167 --> 00:45:21,285
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

383
00:45:21,847 --> 00:45:25,396
Farewell, Oh Daesu.

392

00:46:51,927 --> 00:46:55,806
It's a w ell trusted dru g
used to treat sc hizo phrenia.

394
00:46:55,927 --> 00:47:01,718
The duration time is important,
so how long time w ill he...

395
00:47:02,087 --> 00:47:04,203
15 y ears.

396
00:47:05,607 --> 00:47:09,600
- Too long?
- What did he do?

397
00:47:09,727 --> 00:47:12,241

Go to sleep.

400
00:47:19,967 --> 00:47:22,845
Time to visit Joo hwan
at the Internet ca f tomorrow.

401
00:47:31,927 --> 00:47:34,919
Sit wherever you like.

402
00:47:36,087 --> 00:47:38,442
Joo hwan.

403
00:47:48,567 --> 00:47:52,321
0 h Daesu, y ou see,

404
00:47:56,567 --> 00:47:59,559
Have you heard this voice be fore?

405
00:47:59,687 --> 00:48:03,157
Is there anyone,
who hates me this much?

406
00:48:08,727 --> 00:48:14,643
I don't know all the 260 names
o f your women's husbands.

407
00:48:28,367 --> 00:48:32,360
- Who's Mido?
- This girl cries over nothing.

408
00:48:36,167 --> 00:48:38,920
Joo hwan.

409
00:48:39,847 --> 00:48:44,398
Did I really talk too much?

410
00:48:47,327 --> 00:48:49,795
My friend,
I'd like for you

411
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:56,241
to find that criminal
among people you're close to.

412
00:48:58,447 --> 00:49:01,280
"Search: Evergreen"

413
00:49:06,847 --> 00:49:09,600
"Evergreen
invites you to conversation"

414
00:49:12,247 --> 00:49:15,557
"Congratulations, your case was
automatically dismissed yesterday."

415
00:49:15,887 --> 00:49:18,276
But remember this
by all means

416
00:49:18,407 --> 00:49:21,046
Open quote:

417
00:49:21,287 --> 00:49:24,279
Like a gazelle from the hand
o f the hunter.

418
00:49:24,407 --> 00:49:28,480
Like a bird
from the snare o f the fowler.

419
00:49:28,607 --> 00:49:30,996
Free yourself.

420
00:49:33,607 --> 00:49:35,040
Close quote.

421
00:49:36,367 --> 00:49:40,042
- Who are you?
- And you, you rotten bastard?

422
00:49:40,167 --> 00:49:42,283
I made u p my mind
w hen I w as imprisoned,

423
00:49:42,407 --> 00:49:44,682
I w ouldn't trust any one any more.

424
00:49:44,807 --> 00:49:47,116
If there's any one
w ho I find sus pic ious

425
00:49:47,247 --> 00:49:51,160
then I'll c reate a sec ret
that person and I w ill only know.

426
00:49:51,287 --> 00:49:54,802
That ID, monster, is a trap
that I made to catch you.

427
00:49:54,927 --> 00:49:58,522
You lead a stranger to your place.
Who the hell are you?

428
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:10,197
Who's Evergreen?

429
00:50:16,927 --> 00:50:20,442
I trac ked dow n that Evergreen ID
and found the ow ner's name.

430
00:50:20,567 --> 00:50:23,320
- Ready to jot it dow n?
- Go ahead.

431
00:50:23,447 --> 00:50:26,996
It's Su Daeoh. That's
a strange rare surname. - Address?

432
00:50:27,127 --> 00:50:31,882
In Eungam, Saew oon apartments.
Building 7, room 407.

433
00:50:36,687 --> 00:50:41,078
I'm not doing fine
w ithin life in a bigger prison.

434
00:50:58,807 --> 00:51:00,684
"Evergreen"

435
00:51:01,807 --> 00:51:04,526
"Who are you?"

436
00:51:07,487 --> 00:51:10,604
You meant to ask this, right?

437
00:51:10,887 --> 00:51:15,085
You can find out on your own.
Come on, it's a game.

438
00:51:15,967 --> 00:51:20,722
First, "who?"
Then, "why?"

439
00:51:20,847 --> 00:51:24,078
If you figure it out,
come see me anytime.

440
00:51:24,207 --> 00:51:27,836
I'll raise your score.
You have until July 5th.

441
00:51:28,247 --> 00:51:31,205
Oh no, only five day s le ft.

442
00:51:32,847 --> 00:51:34,997
Too short?

443
00:51:35,127 --> 00:51:39,917
Hang in there. If you succeed
I'll kill my self and not Mido.

444
00:51:41,967 --> 00:51:45,004
That's right, Mido.

445
00:51:45,127 --> 00:51:49,040
I'm going to kill every woman
you love until you die.

446
00:51:51,207 --> 00:51:54,279
Well, you're notorious for
not protecting your women.

447
00:52:01,647 --> 00:52:05,242
Wow, you're strong,
Mr. Monster.

448
00:52:05,847 --> 00:52:09,317
Yes, you're the very
monster I created.

449
00:52:10,407 --> 00:52:15,083
But you won't find out the "Why"
if you do this.

450
00:52:15,407 --> 00:52:20,720
15 years o f being curious to waste.
So is that okay with you?

451
00:52:29,087 --> 00:52:31,078
Sit down there.

452
00:52:37,127 --> 00:52:40,199
Oh, the famous teeth torture.

453
00:52:41,167 --> 00:52:43,840
You won't have enough
time to torture me.

454
00:52:43,967 --> 00:52:47,516
Since I have a weak heart
I have a pacemaker in my chest.

455
00:52:47,647 --> 00:52:51,083
When it was put in

456
00:52:51,207 --> 00:52:54,438
know what I asked the doctor?

457
00:52:56,007 --> 00:53:02,560
Doctor Hopkins, give me a remote
control to turn the motor o ff.

458
00:53:03,167 --> 00:53:06,842
Pardon? Why?

459
00:53:08,047 --> 00:53:12,962
So that I can kill my self
easily at anytime.

460
00:53:13,447 --> 00:53:16,757
I'll give you $ 100, 000 more.

461
00:53:29,647 --> 00:53:31,797
Oh, what will you do?

462
00:53:31,927 --> 00:53:38,036
You want to kill me right away,
but you won't find out "Why".

463
00:53:38,447 --> 00:53:43,805
You want to torture me
but I say I'll my self first.

464
00:53:43,927 --> 00:53:48,523
Do you seek revenge
or do you find the truth?

465
00:53:49,607 --> 00:53:52,804
Oh, you're in a though spot.

466
00:53:52,927 --> 00:53:55,999
I've been watching over you
for 15 years.

467
00:53:57,767 --> 00:54:02,761
I faired well thanks to you.
I wasn't bored or lonely.

468
00:54:05,967 --> 00:54:09,960
Seeking revenge is the best cure
for someone who got hurt.

469
00:54:10,087 --> 00:54:12,601
Try it.

470
00:54:12,927 --> 00:54:17,876
The loss o f 15 years,
the pain o f losing

471
00:54:18,007 --> 00:54:22,876
your wife and child.
You can forget all this.

472
00:54:23,007 --> 00:54:25,760
Once again
revenge is good for your health.

473
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:31,166
But... What happens a fter
you've revenged yourself?

474
00:54:31,567 --> 00:54:36,118
I bet that hidden pain
will probably come back again.

475
00:54:38,167 --> 00:54:40,476
Are you there, Daesu?

476
00:54:41,847 --> 00:54:43,758
Daesu,

477
00:54:43,887 --> 00:54:46,481
long time no see.

478
00:54:54,087 --> 00:54:56,317
Hasn't she been tied up
for too long?

479
00:54:56,447 --> 00:54:58,642
I think you also
le ft the door open.

480
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:13,319
Please save me.

481
00:55:14,487 --> 00:55:16,682
But I could die first.

482
00:55:25,767 --> 00:55:28,235
This dentist is really good.

483
00:55:36,287 --> 00:55:38,084
Don't move.

484
00:55:38,647 --> 00:55:41,320
Stay still.

485
00:55:41,727 --> 00:55:43,922
What's with you?

486
00:55:46,887 --> 00:55:49,447
Now.

487
00:55:49,567 --> 00:55:51,922
Here we go.

488
00:56:09,567 --> 00:56:14,846
You see, they say that people

489
00:56:14,967 --> 00:56:18,596
shrivel up because
they have imagination.

490
00:56:18,727 --> 00:56:21,844
So do not imagine.

491
00:56:21,967 --> 00:56:25,562
You'll become brave as hell.

492
00:56:25,687 --> 00:56:28,804
Now, here comes the real thing.

493
00:56:55,847 --> 00:56:57,917
Yes?

494
00:56:58,287 --> 00:57:03,520
You know I'm glad
you told me about this place

495
00:57:03,647 --> 00:57:07,083
but I haven't even started.

496
00:57:07,207 --> 00:57:09,004
What?

497
00:57:21,487 --> 00:57:23,523
Let's go.

498
00:57:38,767 --> 00:57:40,723
Let's really go.

499
00:57:41,327 --> 00:57:43,397
Let's fight.

500
00:57:45,287 --> 00:57:47,517
Let's fight.

501
00:57:52,167 --> 00:57:54,556
- What a roughneck.
- Your hand.

502
00:57:55,527 --> 00:57:58,325
I'm going to chop o ff
your hand.

503
00:57:58,607 --> 00:58:01,644
You touched Mido's breasts.

504
00:58:06,887 --> 00:58:09,481
Then what about my tongue?

505
00:58:24,407 --> 00:58:27,444
You still don't trust me,
bastard!

506
00:58:30,207 --> 00:58:32,641
It looks hard to accomplish.
I looked into it

507
00:58:32,767 --> 00:58:36,282
and the reason why the bank
re fused to pay $ 270 million

508
00:58:36,407 --> 00:58:39,717
isn't because our building
has any irregularities.

509
00:58:39,847 --> 00:58:42,315
They have an internal
problem at their bank.

510
00:58:45,687 --> 00:58:49,316
So I think there
won't be any problems

511
00:58:49,927 --> 00:58:52,361
although Chairman Choi's

512
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:54,762
equity share is at 25 per cent.

513
00:59:01,167 --> 00:59:04,284
- Daesu.
- Yeah?

514
00:59:07,927 --> 00:59:13,126
- Did he really say that he'll kill me?
- Yeah.

515
00:59:14,727 --> 00:59:17,924
Because you love me?

516
00:59:22,887 --> 00:59:27,438
- Daesu.
- What?

517
00:59:28,247 --> 00:59:33,924
I wonder where my love is

518
00:59:34,047 --> 00:59:37,722
The night is getting lonelier

519
00:59:38,847 --> 00:59:42,601
The words we spoke
through our eyes

520
00:59:43,687 --> 00:59:47,396
C an be felt throu gh
the hands

521
00:59:47,887 --> 00:59:52,244
So many nights
have passed

522
00:59:52,647 --> 00:59:56,879
Yet my feelings are constant
tow ards y ou

523
00:59:57,247 --> 01:00:01,001
Tears flood out from my eyes

524
01:00:01,487 --> 01:00:06,083
But there is a face that I miss

525
01:00:10,287 --> 01:00:14,519
They packed their stuff
and le ft in a rental car.

526
01:00:16,007 --> 01:00:19,795
Mido called the restaurant
and quit.

527
01:00:23,887 --> 01:00:26,447
Let's go a fter this is done.

528
01:00:28,007 --> 01:00:30,965
You should get some rest today.

529
01:00:32,287 --> 01:00:34,801
I can't even sleep.

530
01:00:35,007 --> 01:00:37,475
Since I'm forlorn.

531
01:00:37,607 --> 01:00:39,802
Mr. Han,

532
01:00:39,927 --> 01:00:42,964
do you really think

533
01:00:43,087 --> 01:00:46,523
Mido has fallen in love
with Daesu?

534
01:00:47,447 --> 01:00:49,802
Already?

535
01:01:08,887 --> 01:01:12,402
Daesu, it really hurts.

536
01:01:13,127 --> 01:01:16,278
But I'm enduring it.

537
01:01:16,967 --> 01:01:19,276
You must know this.

538
01:01:32,847 --> 01:01:35,839
How'd you hold out?
For 15 years?

539
01:01:36,287 --> 01:01:38,482
There's alway s a way.

540
01:01:38,887 --> 01:01:40,764
Do you like it?

541
01:01:42,327 --> 01:01:44,761
You really like it, right?

542
01:01:45,127 --> 01:01:47,925
I want to be good to you.

543
01:02:14,327 --> 01:02:17,444
Do not w orry about the future.

544
01:02:18,007 --> 01:02:20,999
Don't imagine anything.

545
01:02:30,527 --> 01:02:34,202
I feel like thanking
all those y ears in that prison.

546
01:02:35,927 --> 01:02:37,918
If I w asn't in there

547
01:02:38,047 --> 01:02:41,244
could Mido have liked me?

548
01:04:12,855 --> 01:04:16,848
He could only know that I w anted
to c ho p off Mr. Park's hand

549
01:04:16,975 --> 01:04:20,365
by putting a bu g on us.

550
01:04:20,495 --> 01:04:23,214
And he knew our w hereabouts
by tailing us.

551
01:04:23,335 --> 01:04:25,485
"I've been bugged.
Please find it."

552
01:04:25,615 --> 01:04:29,403
You know
may be he freed y ou

553
01:04:29,535 --> 01:04:34,131
bec ause he has fun
w atc hing y ou seeking revenge.

554
01:04:35,135 --> 01:04:39,765
And never tell y ou w hy, so he
c an toy w ith y ou forever.

555
01:04:41,175 --> 01:04:43,530
You think that's w hy?

But it's time to close up.

566
01:05:32,135 --> 01:05:36,606
Can't I look at the records
o f Class -79?

567
01:05:40,375 --> 01:05:43,492
It's dark,
so turn on the lights.

568
01:05:45,895 --> 01:05:48,329
Take your time.

569
01:05:51,735 --> 01:05:55,364
Joo hwan?
Let me ask you something.

570
01:05:55,615 --> 01:05:57,571
Do you know
Lee Woojin o f Class -79?

571
01:05:57,695 --> 01:06:00,493
I think he went to America to study.

572
01:06:01,175 --> 01:06:03,530
Lee Woo jin?

573
01:06:03,655 --> 01:06:06,249
Don't know him.
So is that the bastard's name?

574
01:06:06,375 --> 01:06:08,411
How'd find him?

575
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:12,207
I looked through all the school's
albums and found his face.

576
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:15,054
I don't know w ho someone is
just w ith a name.

577
01:06:15,175 --> 01:06:16,688
Got anything else?

578
01:06:16,815 --> 01:06:19,613
Why don't y ou look for
the sc hool records or something?

579
01:06:19,735 --> 01:06:22,533
Do you know Lee Soo ah?
She was in the same grade.

580
01:06:22,655 --> 01:06:24,247
Lee Soo ah?

581
01:06:24,375 --> 01:06:26,889
- She died.
- What class was she in?

582
01:06:27,015 --> 01:06:31,566
Homeroom tw o of our senior y ear.
She w as in my room, ne xt to y ours.

583
01:06:32,095 --> 01:06:34,165
What about her?

584
01:06:35,775 --> 01:06:38,005
Why is there no photo?

585
01:06:40,055 --> 01:06:45,209
Ah, she died so that's why.
How did Soo ah die?

586
01:06:45,335 --> 01:06:49,294
Yeah, y ou w ouldn't know,
she died after y ou transferred.

587
01:06:49,855 --> 01:06:52,847
She w ent alone to the Habc hun

588
01:06:52,975 --> 01:06:56,331
an fell into the river.

589
01:07:00,375 --> 01:07:02,445
She c roaked like a dead fish.

590
01:07:02,575 --> 01:07:05,135
A w eek later they found
her bloated body in the w ater.

591
01:07:05,255 --> 01:07:07,485
- What was she like?
- Her?

592
01:07:07,615 --> 01:07:09,446
She was a total slut.

593
01:07:09,575 --> 01:07:11,805
On the outside
she acted like a prude

594
01:07:11,935 --> 01:07:15,405
but she was a filthy whore
on the inside.

595
01:07:16,615 --> 01:07:21,166
Rumours had it that
that slut fucked everyone at school.

596
01:07:21,295 --> 01:07:24,571
I should've gotten in there.

597
01:07:26,815 --> 01:07:30,967
I also heard that her family
was really rich.

598
01:07:31,935 --> 01:07:34,324
Her grades were good, too.

599
01:07:34,455 --> 01:07:37,492
But the bad thing
was that she was a slut.

600
01:07:38,775 --> 01:07:41,130
Man, this is such an old story.

601
01:07:41,255 --> 01:07:43,894
It's been a long time.

602
01:07:44,015 --> 01:07:47,166
But that Soo ah, you see...

603
01:08:04,255 --> 01:08:06,166
Hey, w hat's going on? Hey!

604
01:08:06,615 --> 01:08:09,209
Joo hw an!
What's w ith y ou?

605
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:11,246
Joo hw an!

606
01:08:13,495 --> 01:08:15,372
Oh Daesu

607
01:08:15,495 --> 01:08:20,125
My sister wasn't a slut.

608
01:08:20,255 --> 01:08:23,725
You must accept this.

609
01:08:23,855 --> 01:08:27,484
Since you got rid o f your bug

610
01:08:27,615 --> 01:08:31,164
I had to come all the way here

611
01:08:31,295 --> 01:08:33,365
to eavesdrop.

612
01:08:33,495 --> 01:08:37,454
So that's why Joo hwan died.
Because o f you.

613
01:08:55,295 --> 01:09:00,164
I'm going to kill y ou!
You son of a bitc h!

614
01:09:22,735 --> 01:09:24,453
You motherfucking cocksucker!

615
01:09:43,375 --> 01:09:47,368
We're not open yet.
Please come back in an hour.

616
01:09:47,495 --> 01:09:51,204
Someone who got six gold teeth
recommended this place.

617
01:09:59,215 --> 01:10:01,285
Mr. Park?

618
01:10:01,775 --> 01:10:04,164
I had to move because o f you.

619
01:10:04,295 --> 01:10:07,173
As an commemoration

620
01:10:07,295 --> 01:10:11,527
I installed a new TV.
Do you like it?

621
01:10:12,495 --> 01:10:16,044
There are so many channels.
Great, huh?

622
01:10:16,175 --> 01:10:19,087
There are even some
who pre fer to stay here.

623
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:22,093
You lived in a place like this
for 15 years?

624
01:10:22,215 --> 01:10:25,287
It felt like home
a fter 11 years though.

625
01:10:25,415 --> 01:10:29,203
Come on.
I don't need money.

626
01:10:29,815 --> 01:10:33,091
An enemy's enemy is a friend.

627
01:10:37,535 --> 01:10:40,811
We threw away the hand
'cause it rotted.

628
01:10:42,415 --> 01:10:46,328
Damn sons o f bitches.
I'll kick their asses.

629
01:10:48,695 --> 01:10:52,608
So why'd you bring me here?

630
01:10:57,415 --> 01:11:01,454
If I don't return a fter July 5th
then let her go.

631
01:11:05,015 --> 01:11:06,892
While I was locked up here

632
01:11:07,015 --> 01:11:10,405
I remember someone visiting me.

633
01:11:10,535 --> 01:11:13,333
What did that person do?
Was it three times?

634
01:11:13,455 --> 01:11:17,050
I put a hypnosis inducing
drug on your water.

635
01:11:17,175 --> 01:11:19,973
Sodium Barbiturate?

636
01:11:20,735 --> 01:11:23,329
TV man knows it all.

637
01:11:43,055 --> 01:11:44,773
That's nonsense.

638
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:47,250
Even though it was a
Catholic school

639
01:11:47,375 --> 01:11:51,846
she wouldn't die because o f
a couple o f rumours.

640
01:11:53,575 --> 01:11:56,487
There's probably another reason.

641
01:11:56,615 --> 01:11:59,004
Could she have been pregnant?

642
01:11:59,135 --> 01:12:02,810
I really don't think
Soo ah was like that.

643
01:12:02,935 --> 01:12:07,565
She was such a pure girl.
She didn't sleep with anyone.

644
01:12:08,855 --> 01:12:14,088
But she did go out
with someone back then.

645
01:12:15,735 --> 01:12:18,647
So who was that guy?

646
01:12:18,935 --> 01:12:21,768
I have no idea.

647
01:12:33,415 --> 01:12:37,533
Choon shim?
You knew Lee Soo ah, right?

648
01:12:37,655 --> 01:12:40,374
Who was her boyfriend?

649
01:12:40,495 --> 01:12:42,326
Don't know?

650
01:12:42,455 --> 01:12:47,404
Shut up! What would you know
about friendship!

651
01:12:48,295 --> 01:12:52,174
Shut the crap.
Then who'd know?

652
01:12:52,295 --> 01:12:55,605
Who? Joo hwan?

653
01:12:58,375 --> 01:13:01,287
What?

654
01:13:02,655 --> 01:13:05,089
Yeah, I know him.

655
01:13:05,215 --> 01:13:07,888
But how'd he know?

656
01:13:08,015 --> 01:13:10,688
Yeah? Really?

657
01:13:11,455 --> 01:13:14,686
Okay, hung up.
I'll call you back.

658
01:13:20,055 --> 01:13:22,410
Choon shim said

659
01:13:22,535 --> 01:13:27,973
she heard it from Joo hwan
and that you'd know the best.

660
01:13:42,695 --> 01:13:46,131
Ring, ring, move aside.

661
01:13:49,895 --> 01:13:53,888
You'll get hurt if y ou hesitate.

662
01:14:24,455 --> 01:14:28,687
Oh Daesu! Look at you!
Put it out!

663
01:14:28,935 --> 01:14:32,530
I'm trans ferring today.
To Soeul.

664
01:14:34,215 --> 01:14:36,570
So butt out, Miss Kim.

665
01:14:37,135 --> 01:14:39,603
You good for nothing!

666
01:15:33,215 --> 01:15:35,649
You're Oh Daesu, right?

667
01:15:36,615 --> 01:15:41,370
- And you're Miss...
- You're popular among the girls.

668
01:15:42,375 --> 01:15:45,128
You know how rumours are.

669
01:15:45,255 --> 01:15:48,930
I heard you're really funny.
Say something.

670
01:15:50,055 --> 01:15:54,287
Me being popular
is such a big hassle.

671
01:16:04,335 --> 01:16:09,363
There's this father and son.
They went to the public bath, and...

672
01:16:09,495 --> 01:16:11,725
See you later.

673
01:16:33,175 --> 01:16:36,724
See you later!
Third grade, third grade pals.

674
01:17:33,375 --> 01:17:37,766
- Come on.
- Wait.

675
01:17:38,735 --> 01:17:41,408
- Come here.
- I won't.

676
01:17:42,255 --> 01:17:45,372
- Hurry and come here.
- Okay, okay.

677
01:17:53,495 --> 01:17:55,565
Satis fied?

678
01:17:55,695 --> 01:17:58,414
- Raise this up.
- Come on.

679
01:17:58,535 --> 01:18:01,095
- Raise it.
- I won't.

680
01:18:13,735 --> 01:18:16,044
What?

681
01:18:22,935 --> 01:18:25,324
It tickles.

682
01:18:52,775 --> 01:18:54,527
Give it here.

683
01:18:58,975 --> 01:19:01,364
- What are you doing?
- Let me see.

684
01:19:01,495 --> 01:19:03,850
What are you doing?

685
01:19:03,975 --> 01:19:06,614
- Let me see.
- Stop.

686
01:19:16,175 --> 01:19:19,053
Go away.

687
01:20:55,375 --> 01:21:00,449
- Was it really Soo ah?
- I don't know her name.

688
01:21:00,575 --> 01:21:06,047
All I know is that she's in your room
a she rides a red bike.

689
01:21:12,055 --> 01:21:14,774
Have a good trip.
See you in Seoul if I go.

690
01:21:14,895 --> 01:21:16,294
Where are you going?

691
01:21:16,415 --> 01:21:19,054
Going on a date
with Choon shim.

692
01:21:19,455 --> 01:21:22,128
I'll kill you
if you shoot your mouth.

693
01:21:26,375 --> 01:21:28,843
No w ay.

694
01:21:29,215 --> 01:21:33,686
You get loc ked u p for 15 y ears
just for doing that?

695
01:21:35,015 --> 01:21:38,928
Was that suc h a big c rime?

696
01:21:39,495 --> 01:21:41,963
Be it a grain of s and or roc k

697
01:21:42,095 --> 01:21:45,246
in w ater they sink as the s ame.

698
01:21:47,375 --> 01:21:50,765
That's what Lee Woojin believes.

699
01:21:51,375 --> 01:21:55,607
Then,
what does July 5th stand for?

700
01:21:56,735 --> 01:21:59,408
That's the day

701
01:22:00,735 --> 01:22:04,125
Lee Soo ah died.

702
01:22:07,855 --> 01:22:10,005
Now it's over.

703
01:22:10,135 --> 01:22:12,091
Instead o f seeking revenge

704
01:22:12,215 --> 01:22:16,333
you wanted to find out
why you were imprisoned, right?

705
01:22:16,735 --> 01:22:21,445
Now we'll run away where
he can never find us, right?

706
01:22:24,255 --> 01:22:26,530
I can't end it like this.

707
01:22:26,655 --> 01:22:29,647
Seeking revenge
has become a part o f me.

708
01:22:34,415 --> 01:22:37,612
But you don't even know
where he lives.

709
01:22:38,535 --> 01:22:41,527
Like a gazelle
from the hand of the hunter.

710
01:22:41,655 --> 01:22:44,886
Like a bird
from the snare of the fow ler.

711
01:22:45,015 --> 01:22:47,848
Free y ourself.

712
01:22:47,975 --> 01:22:50,330
It's a phrase from
"Jamon" 6, verse 4.

713
01:22:50,455 --> 01:22:52,332
Jamon in English
means Maxim.

714
01:22:52,455 --> 01:22:56,846
And Evergreen s aid
he lives in a high tow er.

715
01:22:56,975 --> 01:23:01,366
So six and four
must be just floors.

716
01:23:03,015 --> 01:23:05,404
Fourth floor.

717
01:23:05,535 --> 01:23:07,412
Sixth floor.

718
01:23:07,535 --> 01:23:10,254
0 r the sixty forth floor?

719
01:23:11,735 --> 01:23:13,373
P?

720
01:23:17,895 --> 01:23:20,773
Please insert the code.

721
01:23:26,255 --> 01:23:29,452
What would you
like me to pray?

722
01:23:31,455 --> 01:23:35,130
Wrong entry.
Please insert again.

723
01:23:40,175 --> 01:23:43,850
Wrong entry.
Please insert again.

724
01:23:44,095 --> 01:23:46,563
Dear Lord

725
01:23:47,175 --> 01:23:49,814
please let me meet

726
01:23:49,935 --> 01:23:53,325
a younger man next time.

727
01:24:40,455 --> 01:24:46,405
Please let Woojin
bow next to Daesu

728
01:24:46,535 --> 01:24:50,164
and make him
beg forgiveness.

729
01:25:02,575 --> 01:25:05,328
You slept with your sister.

730
01:25:14,975 --> 01:25:17,728
Let's go up and talk.

731
01:25:38,935 --> 01:25:40,687
Take him!

732
01:26:01,935 --> 01:26:04,654
Don't be so violent.

733
01:26:33,815 --> 01:26:36,045
Feels great.

734
01:26:37,335 --> 01:26:41,089
- You slept with our sister.
- I feel so re freshing.

735
01:26:46,815 --> 01:26:49,568
And I started the rumours.

736
01:26:49,935 --> 01:26:53,007
That's why your sister died.

737
01:26:58,855 --> 01:27:02,814
Looking through the mirror
reminds me o f that day.

738
01:27:03,615 --> 01:27:09,133
Erasing my memory and telling me
to find the truth was unfair.

739
01:27:09,255 --> 01:27:14,613
I won,
so die like you promised.

740
01:27:15,015 --> 01:27:19,452
You think you forgot that day
because you were hypnotized?

741
01:27:19,775 --> 01:27:22,164
Are you sure?

742
01:27:22,295 --> 01:27:25,970
Do you know the real reason
why you can't remember?

743
01:27:28,135 --> 01:27:30,774
Let me tell you.

744
01:27:33,455 --> 01:27:35,650
You just forgot.

745
01:27:36,775 --> 01:27:38,447
Is that bland?

746
01:27:38,575 --> 01:27:41,487
But it's true
that you just forgot.

747
01:27:41,775 --> 01:27:45,370
Why?
Since it's not your business.

748
01:27:45,575 --> 01:27:48,214
Your rumour
grew so out o f proportion

749
01:27:48,335 --> 01:27:51,691
that Soo ah being pregnant
became a rumour.

750
01:27:51,815 --> 01:27:53,851
My sister got sucked
into that rumour.

751
01:27:53,975 --> 01:27:55,613
And began believing it.

752
01:27:55,735 --> 01:27:59,887
So her period stopped
and her belly began to swell.

753
01:28:00,015 --> 01:28:01,607
Funny, isn't it?

754
01:28:01,735 --> 01:28:05,523
Ever though how'd a girl feel
bearing both her child and nephew?

755
01:28:05,655 --> 01:28:07,850
Understand now?

756
01:28:08,415 --> 01:28:12,169
Your tongue
got my sister pregnant.

757
01:28:14,095 --> 01:28:17,770
It wasn't Lee Woojin's dick

758
01:28:17,895 --> 01:28:20,534
it was Oh Daesu's tongue.

759
01:28:24,695 --> 01:28:26,970
Is that why you killed your sister?

760
01:28:27,095 --> 01:28:31,805
Even though how'd the boy feel
impregnating a child and nephew?

761
01:28:35,135 --> 01:28:37,046
You were probably a fraid.

762
01:28:37,175 --> 01:28:41,453
Afraid that everyone will know
once the baby's born.

763
01:28:41,575 --> 01:28:45,932
When you realized that she
imagined it a fter you killed her.

764
01:28:46,055 --> 01:28:49,206
I understand your hate.

765
01:28:55,895 --> 01:29:01,891
They said Soo ah died alone at the
dam, but who took this photo?

766
01:29:02,215 --> 01:29:05,491
And what about the date July 5th?

767
01:29:11,455 --> 01:29:14,447
This is no fun.

768
01:29:14,575 --> 01:29:20,013
I'll just finish what I was say ing.
Listen care fully. My story is fun.

769
01:29:20,415 --> 01:29:23,725
Ever heard o f
posthypnotic suggestion?

770
01:29:23,855 --> 01:29:26,369
You suggest something
during hypnosis

771
01:29:26,495 --> 01:29:28,929
and then it's acted out
in your wakened state.

772
01:29:29,055 --> 01:29:32,127
Still haven't figured it out?

773
01:29:36,935 --> 01:29:40,723
"You lead a stranger to your place.
Who the hell are you?"

774
01:29:41,615 --> 01:29:44,049
What about y ou, y ou bastard?

775
01:29:47,815 --> 01:29:50,727
We hypnotized both o f you.

776
01:29:51,815 --> 01:29:54,648
One very fortunate thing
was that both o f you were

777
01:29:54,775 --> 01:29:58,245
highly receptive to hypnosis
compared to others.

778
01:29:59,255 --> 01:30:01,007
Isn't this fun?

779
01:30:01,135 --> 01:30:05,253
One word gets you pregnant
one word gets you in love.

780
01:30:07,535 --> 01:30:11,244
But no matter how much you two
are receptive to hypnosis

781
01:30:11,375 --> 01:30:14,412
or no matter how good o f a
hypnotist Mrs. Yoo is

782
01:30:14,535 --> 01:30:18,767
getting people
to fall in love isn't eas y.

783
01:30:20,255 --> 01:30:23,167
So do you know how we did it?

784
01:30:25,015 --> 01:30:28,291
Your first suggestion
was to go to that restaurant

785
01:30:28,415 --> 01:30:30,406
a fter your release.

786
01:30:30,535 --> 01:30:35,893
Next, to react to
the cell phone's melody.

787
01:30:37,255 --> 01:30:41,134
When you heard this
you were to say something.

788
01:30:42,415 --> 01:30:45,168
Who are you?

789
01:30:45,295 --> 01:30:48,412
Do you like your clothes?

790
01:30:49,535 --> 01:30:54,245
And Mido was to react
to the man who were to say this.

791
01:30:54,575 --> 01:30:56,691
When she grabs your hand

792
01:30:56,815 --> 01:30:59,454
your reaction would be...

793
01:31:02,015 --> 01:31:05,803
Your gravest mistake wasn't
failing to find the answer.

794
01:31:05,935 --> 01:31:11,168
You can't find the right answers
if you ask the wrong questions.

795
01:31:11,455 --> 01:31:14,447
It's not
"Why did Woojin imprison me?"

796
01:31:14,575 --> 01:31:18,727
It's
"Why did he release me?"

797
01:31:19,095 --> 01:31:21,848
Once again

798
01:31:21,975 --> 01:31:25,763
Why did Woojin release
Daesu a fter...

799
01:31:27,575 --> 01:31:29,964
15 years?

800
01:33:27,615 --> 01:33:31,494
"Laugh, and the world laughs with
you. Weep, and you will weep alone."

801
01:35:06,015 --> 01:35:08,210
Mr. Han!

802
01:35:15,975 --> 01:35:18,091
Mr. Han!

803
01:36:04,015 --> 01:36:07,007
Mido.
She doesn't know, right?

804
01:36:10,575 --> 01:36:13,294
Why did you hide her there?

805
01:36:14,295 --> 01:36:17,093
You thought he'd hate me.

806
01:36:17,895 --> 01:36:21,331
Couldn't you figure it out
that it was a trap?

807
01:36:22,215 --> 01:36:26,413
How can you protect your woman
with that brain o f yours?

808
01:36:26,735 --> 01:36:30,853
I've been secretly raising Mido
since she was three.

809
01:36:31,695 --> 01:36:34,573
What's wrong with you?

810
01:36:34,815 --> 01:36:37,249
And Mr. Park's hand?

811
01:36:37,375 --> 01:36:40,094
You moron.

812
01:36:40,415 --> 01:36:42,451
Know that new prison o f his?

813
01:36:42,575 --> 01:36:45,373
He said he had to move
so I bought him that building

814
01:36:45,495 --> 01:36:47,326
for his hand!

815
01:37:09,815 --> 01:37:12,534
Daesu!

816
01:37:12,775 --> 01:37:14,572
A box is here.

817
01:37:14,695 --> 01:37:17,653
It's that same violet box.

818
01:37:17,775 --> 01:37:21,484
- He's telling me to open it.
- No!

819
01:37:22,775 --> 01:37:26,051
Don't open it no matter what!

820
01:37:26,335 --> 01:37:29,850
If you open it
something terrible will happen.

821
01:37:30,255 --> 01:37:33,372
What's in it?
You know, don't you?

822
01:37:33,495 --> 01:37:36,407
Mido,
sweet pea, wait a little longer.

823
01:37:36,535 --> 01:37:38,446
I'll be there very soon.

824
01:37:43,295 --> 01:37:46,446
Can't you come right now?

825
01:37:47,735 --> 01:37:49,327
I'm scared.

826
01:37:49,455 --> 01:37:52,253
My sweet pea,
you can wait for me, right?

827
01:37:52,575 --> 01:37:54,611
- Yes.
- Good.

828
01:37:54,735 --> 01:37:59,445
Good girl.
I'll call you very soon, okay?

829
01:38:14,655 --> 01:38:16,850
I beg you...

830
01:38:19,055 --> 01:38:21,728
Please, don't tell Mido.

831
01:38:22,655 --> 01:38:27,046
What has she done wrong?

832
01:38:29,055 --> 01:38:32,570
You know it was all my fault.

833
01:38:34,455 --> 01:38:36,923
I have...!

834
01:38:37,295 --> 01:38:40,128
I have committed
a terrible sin

835
01:38:40,255 --> 01:38:43,133
to your sister.

836
01:38:43,975 --> 01:38:48,685
And I was very wrong to you.
I'm really sorry.

837
01:38:50,575 --> 01:38:55,774
So please leave Mido alone, okay?

838
01:39:00,575 --> 01:39:05,603
If Mido finds out the truth

839
01:39:05,935 --> 01:39:09,371
you asshole

840
01:39:09,775 --> 01:39:12,733
I'll rip your whole body apart

841
01:39:12,855 --> 01:39:17,531
so no one will be able
to find your body any where.

842
01:39:17,655 --> 01:39:22,092
Why? Because I'm
going to chew it all down.

843
01:39:23,695 --> 01:39:26,050
Woojin!

844
01:39:26,175 --> 01:39:29,247
Woojin, I made a mistake.

845
01:39:29,375 --> 01:39:32,128
Please forget what I said.

846
01:39:32,255 --> 01:39:33,893
Sir! Boss!

847
01:39:34,015 --> 01:39:36,085
Woojin!

848
01:39:36,815 --> 01:39:39,454
We are the
Evergreen Old Boy s, remember?

849
01:39:39,575 --> 01:39:46,094
With the energy
from a green pine tree

850
01:39:48,375 --> 01:39:53,005
the great Sangkok High...

851
01:39:56,335 --> 01:39:58,610
I'll do whatever you want.

852
01:39:58,735 --> 01:40:01,408
I'll do anything.
I beg you.

853
01:40:01,535 --> 01:40:06,734
Woojin, if you want me
to be a dog, I will!

854
01:40:07,055 --> 01:40:10,650
I'm Woojin's Dog from now on!

855
01:40:10,775 --> 01:40:13,005
I'm your pupp y!

856
01:40:17,415 --> 01:40:20,213
Look, I'm wagging my tail.

857
01:40:20,935 --> 01:40:25,292
I'm a dog. I'll guard the house.
I'll be your slave dog.

858
01:42:28,495 --> 01:42:30,406
The box...

859
01:42:35,175 --> 01:42:37,735
Just leave it closed.

860
01:42:47,095 --> 01:42:53,887
Now...
What joy will I live for?

861
01:43:55,575 --> 01:43:57,486
Daesu...

862
01:43:57,615 --> 01:43:59,492
It really hurts.

863
01:43:59,615 --> 01:44:02,766
But I'm enduring it.

864
01:44:03,415 --> 01:44:06,691
You must know this.

865
01:44:24,895 --> 01:44:29,093
My sister and I loved each other
even though we knew everything.

866
01:44:32,255 --> 01:44:34,723
Could it be the same
with you two?

867
01:45:16,055 --> 01:45:18,046
Soo ah.

868
01:45:31,775 --> 01:45:33,731
Woojin.

869
01:45:34,815 --> 01:45:37,568
I know you've been scared

870
01:45:39,295 --> 01:45:42,367
so let go o f me, okay?

871
01:45:58,535 --> 01:46:01,049
Remember me, okay?

872
01:46:09,295 --> 01:46:13,288
I have no regrets.
What about you?

873
01:46:55,535 --> 01:46:59,289
This is the w hole adventure
I w ent throu gh until now.

874
01:46:59,415 --> 01:47:03,294
Thank y ou for listening
to a terrible story till the end.

875
01:47:03,415 --> 01:47:07,613
I ho pe that y ou understand
the reason for sending a letter.

876
01:47:07,735 --> 01:47:11,569
The reason for that is
that I have no tongue.

877
01:47:13,295 --> 01:47:17,368
To be honest
I have no reason to help you.

878
01:47:21,575 --> 01:47:23,964
But you see?

879
01:47:24,255 --> 01:47:27,804
I was touched by
this last sentence.

880
01:47:29,215 --> 01:47:32,332
"Even though I'm worse
than even a beast

881
01:47:32,455 --> 01:47:37,370
Don't I have the right to live?"

882
01:47:40,095 --> 01:47:43,804
The hypnosis could go wrong
and disturb your memories.

883
01:47:44,775 --> 01:47:47,733
Will that be okay?

884
01:48:06,535 --> 01:48:12,246
If you're ready
stare at that tree.

885
01:48:28,135 --> 01:48:33,732
The tree is slowly changing
into a concrete column.

886
01:48:41,575 --> 01:48:45,932
You're now in Woo jin's penthouse.

887
01:48:46,375 --> 01:48:49,572
It's a dreary night.

888
01:48:51,135 --> 01:48:56,812
The sound of y our footste ps
to the w indow permeats the room.

889
01:49:09,375 --> 01:49:13,812
When I ring my bell

890
01:49:13,935 --> 01:49:18,451

01:49:25,255 --> 01:49:29,294

893
01:49:29,415 --> 01:49:31,565

I love you, Daesu.
