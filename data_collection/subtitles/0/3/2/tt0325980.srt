1
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,717
<i>Drink up, me hearties, yo ho</i>

2
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,157
<i>We kidnap and ravage</i>
<i>and don't give a hoot</i>

3
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,949
<i>Drink up, me hearties, yo ho</i>

4
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,918
<i>Yo ho, yo ho</i>

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,833
<i>A pirate's life for me</i>

6
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:53,548
<i>We extort, we pilfer</i>
<i>We filch, we sack...</i>

7
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,151
Quiet, missy!
Cursed pirates sail these waters.

8
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,431
You don't want to bring
them down on us.

9
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,351
Mr. Gibbs, that will do.

10
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,031
She was singing about pirates!

11
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,999
Bad luck to sing about pirates
with us mired in this unnatural fog.

12
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,311
- Mark my words.
- Consider them marked.

13
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,435
- On your way.
- Aye, Lieutenant.

14
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,275
Bad luck to have a woman on board,
too. Even a miniature one.

15
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,189
It'd be exciting to meet a pirate.

16
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,555
Think again, Miss Swann.
Vile creatures, the lot of them.

17
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,838
I intend to see to it that any man
who sails under a pirate flag

18
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,831
gets what he deserves.

19
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,470
A short drop and a sudden stop.

20
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,590
I appreciate your fervor,

21
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,356
but I'm concerned about the effect this
subject will have upon my daughter.

22
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,112
My apologies, Governor Swann.

23
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,079
- Actually, I find it all fascinating.
- That's what concerns me.

24
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,629
There's a boy in the water!

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,752
Man overboard!

26
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,829
Man the ropes! Fetch a hook!
Haul him aboard!

27
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,871
He's still breathing.

28
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,110
Mary, Mother of God!

29
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,834
What happened here?

30
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,915
Most likely the powder magazine.
Merchant vessels run heavily armed.

31
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,831
Lot of good it did them.
Everyone's thinking it, I'm saying it.

32
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,672
Pirates!

33
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,636
There's no proof of that!
It was probably an accident.

34
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,754
Rouse the captain. Heave to
and take in sail. Launch the boats.

35
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,390
Elizabeth, accompany the boy.

36
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,956
He'll be in your charge.
Take care of him.

37
00:03:23,991 --> 00:03:25,433
He'll be in your charge.
Take care of him.

38
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,274
It's okay. My name's Elizabeth Swann.

39
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,952
Will Turner.

40
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,831
I'm watching over you, Will.

41
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,071
You're a pirate!

42
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,878
Has he said anything?

43
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,794
His name's William Turner.
That's all I found out.

44
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,711
Take him below.

45
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,998
Elizabeth!

46
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,711
Are you all right?

47
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,912
Are you decent?

48
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,115
Yes.

49
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,032
Yes?

50
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,874
Still abed at this hour?

51
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,637
It's a beautiful day.

52
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,516
I have a gift for you.

53
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,829
- It's beautiful!
- Isn't it?

54
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,515
May I inquire as to the occasion?

55
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,275
Does a father need an occasion
to dote upon his daughter?

56
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,672
Go on.

57
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,872
Actually... I had hoped you might
wear it for the ceremony today.

58
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,154
The ceremony?

59
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,800
Captain Norrington's
promotion ceremony.

60
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,029
I knew it!

61
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,953
Commodore Norrington,
as he's about to become.

62
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,079
A fine gentleman, don't you think?
He fancies you, you know.

63
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,799
Elizabeth? How's it coming?

64
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,392
- It's difficult to say.
- It's the latest fashion in London.

65
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,070
Women in London
must've learned not to breathe!

66
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,113
My Lord, you have a visitor.

67
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,554
Mr. Turner! Good to see you again.

68
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,110
Good day, sir. I have your order.

69
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:08,510
The blade is folded steel. That's
gold filigree laid into the handle.

70
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,992
If I may?

71
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,698
Perfectly balanced. The tang
is nearly the width of the blade.

72
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:16,877
Perfectly balanced. The tang
is nearly the width of the blade.

73
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,750
Impressive. Very impressive.

74
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,677
Commodore Norrington's
going to be very pleased with this.

75
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,794
Do pass my compliments
onto your master.

76
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,472
I shall.

77
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,909
A craftsman is always pleased
to hear his work is appreciated.

78
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,190
Elizabeth!
You look absolutely stunning!

79
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,036
Will! It's so good to see you!

80
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,112
- I had a dream about you last night.
- About me?

81
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,988
- Elizabeth, is that proper?
- About the day we met. Remember?

82
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,071
How could I forget, Miss Swann?

83
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,357
How many times must I ask you
to call me Elizabeth?

84
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,557
At least once more, Miss Swann.
As always.

85
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,235
There. See? At least the boy
has a sense of propriety.

86
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,436
We really must be going.

87
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,876
Good day, Mr. Turner.

88
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,357
Come along!

89
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,278
Good day...

90
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,079
Elizabeth.

91
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,310
Hold up there, you!

92
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,557
It's a shilling to tie up
your boat to the dock.

93
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,828
I need to know your name.

94
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,071
What do you say to three shillings
and we forget the name?

95
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,074
Welcome to Port Royal, Mr. Smith.

96
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,078
Two paces... march!

97
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,476
Right about... face!

98
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,519
Present... arms!

99
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,157
This dock is off limits to civilians.

100
00:11:21,192 --> 00:11:22,475
This dock is off limits to civilians.

101
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,717
I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.
If I see one, I shall inform you.

102
00:11:24,752 --> 00:11:26,874
I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.
If I see one, I shall inform you.

103
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,830
There's some high-toned
and fancy to-do at the fort.

104
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,789
How could it be that two upstanding
gentlemen did not merit an invitation?

105
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,635
We have to make sure this dock
stays off limits to civilians.

106
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,431
It's a fine goal, to be sure,
but it seems to me, a ship like that

107
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,988
makes this one here
a bit superfluous.

108
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,038
The Dauntless is the power
in these waters,

109
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,874
but there's no ship that can match
the Interceptor for speed.

110
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,635
I've heard of one. It's supposed
to be fast, nigh uncatchable.

111
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,792
The Black Pearl.

112
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,435
There's no real ship
that can match the Interceptor.

113
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,476
The Black Pearl is a real ship.

114
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,438
- No, it's not.
- It is. I've seen it!

115
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,236
- You've seen it?
- Yes.

116
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,278
- You haven't seen it!
- Yes, I have!

117
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,354
You've seen a ship with black sails,
that's crewed by the damned

118
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,434
and captained by a man so evil
that Hell itself spat him back out?

119
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,754
- No.
- No.

120
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,638
But I have seen a ship
with black sails.

121
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,029
No ship not crewed by the damned

122
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,032
and captained by a man so evil,
Hell spat him back out,

123
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,318
could have black sails, so couldn't be
any other ship than The Black Pearl.

124
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,834
Is that what you're saying?

125
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,989
No.

126
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:55,471
Like I said, there's no real ship
that can match the Interceptor...

127
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,598
You! Get away from there!
You don't have permission to be aboard!

128
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,353
I'm sorry, but it's such a pretty
boat. Ship!

129
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,755
- What's your name?
- Smith! Or Smithy, if you like.

130
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,991
What's your purpose in Port Royal,
'Mr. Smith'?

131
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,516
- And no lies!
- All right. I confess.

132
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,959
I intend to commandeer a ship,
pick up a crew in Tortuga,

133
00:13:21,994 --> 00:13:23,558
I intend to commandeer a ship,
pick up a crew in Tortuga,

134
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,393
rape, pillage and otherwise
pilfer my black guts out.

135
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,268
- I said no lies!
- I think he's telling the truth.

136
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,511
If he were telling the truth,
he wouldn't have told us.

137
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,435
Unless he knew you wouldn't believe
the truth even if he told you.

138
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,032
May I have a moment?

139
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,790
You look lovely, Elizabeth.

140
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,790
I apologize if I seem forward,
but I must speak my mind.

141
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:15,317
This promotion throws into sharp relief
that which I have not yet achieved.

142
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,875
A marriage to a fine woman.

143
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,400
You have become a fine woman.

144
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,918
I can't breathe!

145
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,673
Yes, I'm a bit nervous myself.

146
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,556
Then they made me their chief.

147
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,472
Elizabeth?

148
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,278
Elizabeth!

149
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,598
The rocks!
Sir, it's a miracle she missed them!

150
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,359
- Will you be saving her?
- I can't swim!

151
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,839
Pride of the King's Navy, you are!
Do not lose these.

152
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,232
What was that?

153
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,912
I got her!

154
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,753
- She's not breathing!
- Move!

155
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,952
- I never would've thought of that.
- You've never been to Singapore.

156
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,478
Where did you get that?

157
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,953
On your feet.

158
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,395
Elizabeth!

159
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,511
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

160
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,117
- Shoot him!
- Father!

161
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,954
Commodore, do you intend
to kill my rescuer?

162
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,598
I believe thanks are in order.

163
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,953
Had a brush with the East India
Trading Company, pirate?

164
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,513
Hang him!

165
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,309
Keep your guns on him, men.
Gillette, fetch some irons.

166
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,472
Well, well. Jack Sparrow, isn't it?

167
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,708
Captain Jack Sparrow,
if you please, sir.

168
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,678
I don't see your ship... 'Captain'.

169
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,075
I'm in the market, as it were.

170
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,355
He said he'd come to commandeer one.

171
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,432
I told you he was telling the truth.
These are his.

172
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,192
No additional shot nor powder.

173
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,756
A compass that doesn't point north.

174
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,717
I half expected it to be made from wood.

175
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,995
You are without doubt
the worst pirate I've ever heard of!

176
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,230
But you have heard of me.

177
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,231
Commodore, I must protest!

178
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,318
Carefully, Lieutenant.

179
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,516
Pirate or not, this man saved my life!

180
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,354
One good deed is not enough to redeem
a man for his wickedness!

181
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,079
- It seems enough to condemn him.
- Indeed.

182
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,914
Finally.

183
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,273
- Don't shoot!
- I knew you'd warm up to me.

184
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:04,319
Commodore Norrington,
my effects, please. And my hat.

185
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,234
Commodore.

186
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,918
- Elizabeth... it is Elizabeth?
- It's Miss Swann.

187
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,028
Miss Swann, if you'd be so kind.
Come, dear, we don't have all day.

188
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,311
If you'll be very kind.

189
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,275
Easy on the goods, darling.

190
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,036
- You're despicable.
- Sticks and stones, love.

191
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,760
I saved your life, you saved mine.
We're square.

192
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,354
Gentlemen, my lady,

193
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,637
you will always remember this
as the day you almost caught...

194
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,075
Captain Jack Sparrow!

195
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,992
- Now will you shoot him?
- Open fire!

196
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,951
On his heels!

197
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,636
Take cover, man!

198
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,271
Gillette, Mr. Sparrow has
a dawn appointment with the gallows.

199
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,476
I would hate for him to miss it.

200
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,911
Search up the stairs!

201
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,551
Look lively, men!

202
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,038
Right where I left you.

203
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,274
Not where I left you.

204
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,356
You're the one they're hunting.

205
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,678
The pirate!

206
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,752
You seem familiar.
Have I threatened you before?

207
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,513
I avoid familiarity with pirates.

208
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,872
It would be a shame to put a black
mark on your record. Excuse me.

209
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,952
Do you think this wise, boy?
Crossing blades with a pirate?

210
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,395
You threatened Miss Swann.

211
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,197
Only a little.

212
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,278
You know what you're doing.
Excellent form. How's your footwork?

213
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,396
If I step here...

214
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,993
Good.

215
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,071
And now I step again.

216
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,638
Ta.

217
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,110
That is a wonderful trick.

218
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,270
Except, once again,
you are between me and my way out.

219
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,272
And now...
you have no weapon.

220
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,278
Who makes all these?

221
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,948
I do.

222
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,756
And I practice with them
three hours a day.

223
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,591
You need to find yourself a girl, mate.

224
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,710
Or, the reason you practice three hours
a day is that you already found one

225
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,270
and are otherwise incapable
of wooing said strumpet.

226
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,749
You're not a eunuch, are you?

227
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:09,038
I practice three hours a day
so when I meet a pirate, I can kill him!

228
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,315
- You cheated!
- Pirate.

229
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,671
- Move away!
- No.

230
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,079
Please?

231
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,789
No! I cannot just step aside
and let you escape.

232
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,191
This shot is not meant for you.

233
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,031
There he is! Over here!

234
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:59,637
Excellent work, Mr. Brown. You've
assisted in the capture of a fugitive.

235
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,915
Just doing my civic duty, sir.

236
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:08,677
I trust you will remember this as the
day Captain Jack Sparrow almost escaped.

237
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,239
Take him away.

238
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,357
- Come here, boy. Come here.
- Who wants a juicy bone?

239
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,639
Come here, boy!

240
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,439
You can keep doing that forever.
The dog is never going to move.

241
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,479
Excuse us if we haven't resigned
ourselves to the gallows just yet.

242
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,119
There you go, miss. It was
a difficult day for you, I'm sure.

243
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,149
I suspected Commodore Norrington would
propose, but I wasn't prepared for it.

244
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,233
I meant you being threatened
by that pirate! Sounds terrifying!

245
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,472
Yes, it was terrifying.

246
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,632
But... the Commodore proposed!
Fancy that.

247
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,349
That's a smart match, miss,
if it's not too bold to say.

248
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,793
It is a smart match.

249
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,598
He's a fine man.

250
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,155
He's what any woman
should dream of marrying.

251
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,438
That Will Turner...
he's a fine man, too.

252
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,238
That is too bold.

253
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,949
Beggin' your pardon.
It was not my place.

254
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,678
Has my daughter
given you an answer yet?

255
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,318
No, she hasn't.

256
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,630
She has had a trying day.

257
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,199
- Ghastly weather, don't you think?
- Really bleak.

258
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,512
What's that?

259
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,717
Cannon fire!

260
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,837
Return fire!

261
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,157
I know those guns.

262
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,556
It's the Pearl.

263
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,551
The Black Pearl?

264
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,158
I've heard stories.

265
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,074
She's been preying on ships
and settlements for ten years.

266
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,118
- Never leaves any survivors.
- No survivors?

267
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,832
Then where do the stories
come from, I wonder?

268
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,999
Mama!

269
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,508
- Sight the muzzle flash.
- Aim for the flashes!

270
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,798
I need a full spread, fore and aft.
Mr. Stevens, more cartridges.

271
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,834
Governor. Barricade yourself
in my office.

272
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,156
That's an order.

273
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,479
Don't!

274
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,836
Hello, chum.

275
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,552
Up there!

276
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,520
Miss Swann,
they've come to kidnap you.

277
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,114
- What?
- You're the governor's daughter!

278
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,031
In here!

279
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,913
They haven't seen you.
First chance you get, run to the fort.

280
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,118
Gotcha!

281
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,269
No! It's hot. I'm burning!

282
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,395
Come on!

283
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,756
Come on, me men.

284
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,549
We know you're here, poppet.

285
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,158
- Poppet!
- Come out.

286
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,715
We promise we won't hurt you.

287
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,268
We will find you, poppet.

288
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,873
You've got something of ours
and it calls to us.

289
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,715
The gold calls to us.

290
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,035
The gold.

291
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,751
Hello, poppet.

292
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,396
Parley.

293
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,711
- What?
- I invoke the right of parley.

294
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:11,954
The Code of the Brethren states
you have to take me to your captain.

295
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,632
I know the Code.

296
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:17,429
You can do me no harm
until the parley is complete.

297
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,957
- To blazes with the Code.
- She wants to be taken to the Captain.

298
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,595
And she'll go, without a fuss.

299
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,552
We must honor the Code.

300
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,671
Say goodbye!

301
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,793
Goodbye.

302
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,269
- Come on.
- Elizabeth.

303
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,636
Out of my way, scum!

304
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,038
My sympathies. You've no manner
of luck at all.

305
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,677
Come on, doggy! It's just
you and me now.

306
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:47,869
It's you and old Jack. Come on.
That's a boy! Get your bone!

307
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,396
That's a good boy.
A bit closer!

308
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,711
That's it, doggy!

309
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,997
Come on, you filthy,
slimy, mangy character!

310
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,513
No! I didn't mean it!

311
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,236
This ain't the armory!

312
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:17,270
Well, well, well. Look what we have
here, Twigg. Captain Jack Sparrow!

313
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,470
Last time I saw you,

314
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:26,908
you were all alone on a godforsaken
island, shrinking into the distance.

315
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,634
His fortunes aren't improved much.

316
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,996
Worry about your own fortunes,
gentlemen.

317
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:37,551
The deepest circle of Hell is reserved
for betrayers and mutineers.

318
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,590
So there is a curse.

319
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,749
- That's interesting.
- You know nothing of Hell.

320
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,551
That's very interesting.

321
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,754
I didn't know we was takin' on captives.

322
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,991
She's invoked the right of parley
with Captain Barbossa.

323
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,550
- I am here to...
- You will speak when spoken to.

324
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:47,355
And ye will not lay a hand on those
under the protection of parley.

325
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,271
Aye, sir.

326
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,998
My apologies, miss.

327
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:59,632
Captain Barbossa... I am here to
negotiate the cessation of hostilities.

328
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,871
There are a lot of long words there.
We're naught but humble pirates.

329
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,593
- What is it you want?
- Leave and never come back.

330
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:15,508
I'm disinclined to acquiesce
to your request.

331
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,995
Means "no."

332
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,515
Very well.

333
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,791
I'll drop it.

334
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:33,156
Me holds are burstin' with swag.
That bit of shine matters to us?

335
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,198
Why?

336
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,034
It's what you've been searching for.
I recognize the ship.

337
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,918
I saw it eight years ago
on the crossing from England!

338
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,991
Did you now?

339
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,472
Fine. I suppose if it is worthless
there's no point in me keeping it.

340
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,198
No!

341
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,031
You have a name, missy?

342
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:11,558
Elizabeth... Turner. I'm a maid
in the Governor's household.

343
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,631
Miss Turner!

344
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,840
- Turner!
- Bootstrap!

345
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:28,714
How does a maid come to own
that trinket? Family heirloom?

346
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,518
I didn't steal it,
if that's what you mean.

347
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,833
You hand it over
and we'll leave and never return.

348
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,151
Our bargain?

349
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:58,870
Still the guns and stow them. Signal
the men and make good to clear port.

350
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,679
You have to take me to shore.
According to the Code...

351
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,352
First...

352
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,433
Your return to shore was not part of
our negotiations so I must do nothing.

353
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,513
Secondly, you must be a pirate for the
Pirate's Code to apply, and you're not.

354
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:16,720
Thirdly, the code is more what
you'd call guidelines than actual rules.

355
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,190
Welcome aboard the Black Pearl,
Miss Turner.

356
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,429
They've taken Elizabeth!

357
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,239
Mr. Murtogg, remove this man.

358
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,194
We have to hunt them down.
We must save her.

359
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,714
Where do you propose we start?

360
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,157
If you have any information
concerning my daughter, share it.

361
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:00,274
That Jack Sparrow.
He talked about the Black Pearl.

362
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,239
Mentioned it is more what he did.

363
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,633
Ask him where it is!
He could lead us to it.

364
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,353
No.

365
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:14,117
The pirates left Sparrow in his cell,
ergo they are not his allies.

366
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,433
We will establish their
most likely course...

367
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,795
That's not good enough!

368
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:26,797
Mr. Turner, you are not a military man
or a sailor. You are a blacksmith.

369
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:30,675
And this is not the moment
for rash actions!

370
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:37,394
Do not think you are the only man here
who cares for Elizabeth.

371
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,393
Please.

372
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,035
- You! Sparrow!
- Aye?

373
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,920
You are familiar with
the Black Pearl?

374
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,355
- I've heard of it.
- Where does it make berth?

375
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,433
Where does it make berth?
Have you not heard the stories?

376
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:07,229
Captain Barbossa and his crew of
miscreants sail from the Isla de Muerta.

377
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:13,077
It's an island that cannot be found,
except by those who know where it is.

378
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:18,154
The ship's real, therefore its anchorage
must be a real place. Where?

379
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,271
- Why ask me?
- Because you're a pirate.

380
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,870
You want to turn pirate yourself.
Is that it?

381
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,231
Never!

382
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,110
- They took Miss Swann.
- So it is that you found a girl!

383
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,992
I see!

384
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,072
If you intend to brave all,
hasten to her rescue,

385
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:43,312
and so, win fair lady's heart,
you'll have to do it alone, mate.

386
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,278
I see no profit in it for me.

387
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,073
- I can get you out of here.
- The key's run off.

388
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:53,552
I helped build these cells.
These are half-pin barrel hinges.

389
00:41:54,840 --> 00:42:00,233
With leverage and the proper application
of strength, the door will lift free.

390
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,797
- What's your name?
- Will Turner.

391
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:10,470
That would be short for William,
I imagine. Good, strong name.

392
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,318
No doubt named for your father.

393
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,957
Yes.

394
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,797
Mr. Turner, I've changed me mind.

395
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,758
If you spring me from here,
I swear, on pain of death,

396
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:28,594
I shall take you to the Black Pearl,
and your bonny lass.

397
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,148
Do we have an accord?

398
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,872
- Agreed.
- Agreed! Get me out!

399
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,630
- Hurry! Someone will have heard that.
- Not without my effects.

400
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,990
We're going to steal a ship?

401
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,834
- That ship?
- Commandeer.

402
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,230
We're going to "commandeer" that ship.
Nautical term.

403
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,636
One question about your business,
or there's no use going.

404
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:07,429
This girl, how far are you willing to go
to save her?

405
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:12,071
- I'd die for her.
- Good. No worries then.

406
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,709
This is either madness or brilliance.

407
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,990
It's remarkable how often
those two traits coincide.

408
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:09,155
Everyone stay calm!
We're taking over the ship.

409
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,196
Aye! Avast!

410
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,755
This ship cannot be crewed by two men.
You'll never make it out of the bay.

411
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,673
Son... I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

412
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,679
Savvy?

413
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,191
- Commodore!
- They're taking the Dauntless!

414
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,516
Commodore! They've taken the ship!

415
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,751
Sparrow and Turner!
They're taking the Dauntless!

416
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,752
Rash, Turner. Too rash.

417
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,319
That is, without doubt, the worst pirate
I have ever seen.

418
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,596
Here they come.

419
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,515
Bring her around!

420
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,673
Search every cabin, every hold,
down to the bilges.

421
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,794
Sailors, back to the Interceptor!

422
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:37,349
Thank you, Commodore,
for getting us ready to make way.

423
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,954
We'd have had
a hard time by ourselves.

424
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,270
Set topsails and clear up this mess.

425
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,635
With this wind we won't catch them.

426
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:50,757
I don't need to. Get them in range
of the long nines.

427
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,832
Run out the guns!

428
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,388
We are to fire on our own ship, sir?

429
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:01,270
I'd rather see her at the bottom of the
ocean than in the hands of a pirate.

430
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,716
Commodore!
He's disabled the rudder chain.

431
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,196
Abandon ship!

432
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:19,477
That's got to be the best pirate
I've ever seen.

433
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,155
So it would seem.

434
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:34,195
When I was a lad living in England,
my mother raised me by herself.

435
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:38,034
After she died, I came here,
looking for my father.

436
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,396
Is that so?

437
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:45,118
My father, Bill Turner?

438
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,078
It was only after you learned my name
you agreed to help.

439
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,833
Since that's what I wanted,
I didn't press the matter.

440
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:54,276
I'm not a simpleton.
You knew my father.

441
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:04,432
I knew him. Probably one of the few
who knew him as William Turner.

442
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:07,512
Everyone else just called him
"Bootstrap".

443
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,431
Bootstrap?

444
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:13,798
Good man. Good pirate.
I swear, you look just like him.

445
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,869
It's not true. He was a merchant sailor.
A respectable man who obeyed the law.

446
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:22,038
He was a bloody pirate, a scallywag.

447
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,119
My father was not a pirate!

448
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,915
Put it away, son.
It's not worth you getting beat again.

449
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,312
You ignored the rules of engagement.
In a fair fight, I'd kill you.

450
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,278
That's not much incentive
for me to fight fair, is it?

451
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,391
As long as you're just
hanging there, pay attention.

452
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:50,153
The only rules that matter are these:

453
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,550
What a man can do
and what a man can't do.

454
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:59,519
You can accept your father was a
pirate and a good man, or you can't.

455
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:03,752
Pirate is in your blood, so you'll
have to square with that someday.

456
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,274
Me, for example,
I can let you drown,

457
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:10,672
but I can't bring this ship into Tortuga
all by me onesies, savvy?

458
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,472
So.

459
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,557
Can you sail under the command
of a pirate?

460
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,711
Or can you not?

461
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,318
Tortuga?

462
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,793
Tortuga.

463
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,600
It is a sad life
that has never breathed deep

464
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,990
the sweet, proliferous bouquet
that is Tortuga. Savvy?

465
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,437
What do you think?

466
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:05,434
- It'll linger.
- I'll tell you, mate,

467
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:11,158
if every town were like this one,
no man would ever feel unwanted.

468
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,996
Scarlett!

469
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,077
Not sure I deserved that.

470
00:49:16,112 --> 00:49:17,115
Not sure I deserved that.

471
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:18,615
Giselle.

472
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:19,230
Giselle.

473
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,958
- Who was she?
- What?

474
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,472
I may have deserved that.

475
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,678
Curse you for breathing,
you slack-jawed idiot!

476
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,071
Mother's love!

477
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,798
Jack!

478
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:39,072
You should know not to wake a man
when he's sleepin'.

479
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:42,869
- It's bad luck.
- Fortunately, I know how to counter it.

480
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,997
The man who did the waking
buys the man who was sleeping a drink.

481
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:50,996
The man who was sleeping drinks it
while listening to his proposition.

482
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,919
Aye, that'll about do it.

483
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,677
Blast! I'm already awake!

484
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,070
That was for the smell.

485
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,311
Keep a sharp eye.

486
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,736
Now, what's the nature
of this venture of your'n?

487
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:25,352
Now, what's the nature
of this venture of your'n?

488
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,630
I'm going after the Black Pearl.

489
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,437
I know where it's going to be,
and I'm gonna take it.

490
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,678
Jack, it's a fool's errand.

491
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,911
You know better than me
the tales of the Black Pearl.

492
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,912
That's why I know
what Barbossa is up to.

493
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,150
All I need is a crew.

494
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:52,916
Captain Barbossa is not a man to suffer
fools nor strike a bargain with one.

495
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,150
It's a good thing I'm not a fool, then.

496
00:50:55,240 --> 00:51:00,075
Prove me wrong. What makes you think
Barbossa will give up his ship to you?

497
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,357
Let's just say it's a matter
of leverage.

498
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,871
The kid?

499
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,318
That is the child
of Bootstrap Bill Turner.

500
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:27,715
His only child. Savvy?

501
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:30,269
Is he now?

502
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,755
Leverage, says you.

503
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:37,752
I feel a change in the wind, says I.

504
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:41,879
I'll find us a crew. There's bound to be
some sailors on this rock crazy as you.

505
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,235
One can only hope.

506
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,659
- Take what you can!
- Give nothin' back!

507
00:51:45,694 --> 00:51:46,998
- Take what you can!
- Give nothin' back!

508
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,793
You'll be dining with the captain,
and he requests you wear this.

509
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,150
Tell him that I am disinclined
to acquiesce to his request.

510
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,390
He said you'd say that.

511
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:26,758
He also said if that be the case,
you'll be dining with the crew.

512
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,718
And you'll be naked.

513
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,589
Fine.

514
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:55,076
There's no need to stand on ceremony,
no call to impress anyone.

515
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,469
You must be hungry.

516
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:16,031
Try the wine.

517
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,838
And the apples. One of those next.

518
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,194
It's poisoned.

519
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,956
There would be no sense
to be killing you.

520
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:39,994
Then release me. You have your trinket.
I'm of no further value to you.

521
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:46,756
You don't know what this is, do you?

522
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,751
It's a pirate medallion.

523
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,798
This is Aztec gold.

524
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:57,637
One of 882 identical pieces they
delivered in a stone chest to Corts.

525
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,374
Blood money paid to stem the slaughter
he wreaked upon them with his armies.

526
00:54:01,409 --> 00:54:03,669
Blood money paid to stem the slaughter
he wreaked upon them with his armies.

527
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,672
But the greed of Corts was insatiable.

528
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,270
So the heathen gods
placed upon the gold...

529
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,514
a terrible curse.

530
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:20,194
Any mortal that removes but
a single piece from that stone chest...

531
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,896
shall be punished for eternity.

532
00:54:21,931 --> 00:54:23,512
Shall be punished for eternity.

533
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:28,150
I hardly believe in ghost stories
any more, Captain Barbossa.

534
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,309
Aye.

535
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:33,470
That's exactly what I thought
when we were first told the tale.

536
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:36,438
Buried on an island of the dead
what cannot be found,

537
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:39,034
except for those who know where it is.

538
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,756
Find it, we did.

539
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:46,673
There be the chest.
Inside be the gold.

540
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,796
And we took 'em all!

541
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,071
We spent 'em and traded 'em,

542
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:55,119
and frittered 'em away on drink and food
and pleasurable company.

543
00:54:55,480 --> 00:55:00,474
The more we gave 'em away,
the more we came to realize...

544
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,477
the drink would not satisfy.

545
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:06,317
Food turned to ash in our mouths,

546
00:55:06,352 --> 00:55:08,075
Food turned to ash in our mouths,

547
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:12,631
and all the pleasurable company
in the world could not slake our lust.

548
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,357
We are cursed men, Miss Turner.

549
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,552
Compelled by greed we were, but now...

550
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:23,995
we are consumed by it.

551
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:38,838
There is one way we can end our curse.

552
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:45,957
All the scattered pieces
of the Aztec gold must be restored,

553
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,951
and the blood repaid.

554
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:54,270
Thanks to ye, we have the final piece.

555
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,316
And the blood to be repaid?

556
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,836
That's why there's no sense
to be killing you.

557
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,797
Yet.

558
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,989
Apple?

559
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:26,034
I'm curious. After killing me,
what are you planning on doing next?

560
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,034
Look!

561
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:32,157
The moonlight shows us
for what we really are.

562
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,459
We are not among the living
and so we cannot die.

563
00:57:34,494 --> 00:57:35,998
We are not among the living
and so we cannot die.

564
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,832
But neither are we dead.

565
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:42,549
For too long I've been parched of thirst
and unable to quench it.

566
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,037
Too long I've been starvin' to death
and haven't died.

567
00:57:45,072 --> 00:57:47,435
Too long I've been starvin' to death
and haven't died.

568
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,556
I feel nothing.

569
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:52,438
Not the wind on my face,
nor the spray of the sea...

570
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:56,189
nor the warmth of a woman's flesh.

571
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:01,158
You best start believing
in ghost stories, Miss Turner.

572
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,071
You're in one!

573
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,515
What are you looking at?
Back to work!

574
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:25,512
You heard the captain.
Back to work.

575
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:35,516
Feast your eyes, Captain. All of them,
faithful hands before the mast.

576
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,558
Every man worth his salt,

577
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,557
and crazy to boot.

578
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:43,513
So this is your able-bodied crew?

579
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,437
- You, sailor!
- Cotton, sir.

580
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,876
Mr. Cotton, do you have the courage
and fortitude to follow orders

581
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,872
and stay true in the face of danger
and almost certain death?

582
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:02,273
- Mr. Cotton. Answer, man!
- He's a mute, sir.

583
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:06,433
Poor devil had his tongue cut out, so
he trained the parrot to talk for him.

584
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,476
No one's yet figured how.

585
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:14,828
Mr. Cotton's parrot,
same question.

586
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,271
Wind in your sails!
Wind in your sails!

587
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,069
Mostly, we figure that means "yes".

588
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:23,310
Of course it does. Satisfied?

589
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,151
Well, you've proved they're mad.

590
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,515
What's the benefit for us?

591
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,195
Anamaria!

592
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:45,269
- I suppose you didn't deserve that.
- No, that one I deserved.

593
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:48,113
- You stole my boat!
- Actually...

594
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:54,989
Borrowed without permission, but with
every intention of bringing it back.

595
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:57,753
- But you didn't!
- You'll get another one.

596
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,351
- I will.
- A better one.

597
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,192
A better one!

598
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,475
- That one.
- What one?

599
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:08,832
That one?

600
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,398
Aye. That one.

601
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:14,959
- What say you?
- Aye!

602
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,359
Aye!

603
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,351
Anchor's aweigh!

604
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:22,399
No, it's frightful bad luck
to bring a woman aboard, sir.

605
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,675
It'll be far worse not to have her.

606
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:00,351
How can we sail to an island
that nobody can find,

607
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:02,556
with a compass that doesn't work?

608
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:07,191
The compass doesn't point north, but
we're not trying to find north, are we?

609
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,749
We should drop canvas, sir.

610
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,796
She can hold a bit longer.

611
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:27,396
What's in your head as puts you
in such a fine mood, Cap'n?

612
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,072
We're catching up.

613
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:45,476
Time to go, poppet.

614
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:43,072
Dead men tell no tales.

615
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:49,911
Chills the bones, how many honest
sailors been claimed by this passage.

616
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,995
How is it that Jack
came by that compass?

617
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:10,038
Not a lot's known about Jack Sparrow
before he came to Tortuga

618
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,680
with a mind to find the treasure
of the Isla de Muerta.

619
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:16,077
That was before I'd met him, when he
was captain of the Black Pearl.

620
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:17,909
What?

621
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:25,269
- He failed to mention that.
- He plays things close to the vest now.

622
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:27,476
And a hard-learned lesson it was.

623
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:31,872
Three days into the trip, the first mate
says, "Everything's an equal share."

624
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:36,511
"The location of the treasure, too."
So Jack gives up the bearings.

625
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:39,751
That night, there was a mutiny.

626
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:42,798
They marooned Jack on an island
and left him to die.

627
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:46,077
But not before he'd
gone mad with the heat.

628
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,030
So that's the reason for all the...

629
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:55,674
Reason's got nothing to do with it.

630
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:00,993
When a pirate's marooned, he's given
a pistol with a single shot. One shot.

631
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:03,833
That won't do much good hunting,
nor to be rescued.

632
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:07,435
But after three weeks
of a starving belly and thirst,

633
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:10,398
that pistol looks real friendly.

634
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:13,631
But Jack escaped the island,
and still has that single shot.

635
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:17,110
He won't use it, though,
save on one man.

636
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,156
His mutinous first mate.

637
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:21,151
- Barbossa.
- Aye.

638
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:25,557
- How did Jack get off the island?
- I'll tell ye.

639
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:29,792
He waded out into the shallows,
and waited three days and three nights,

640
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:34,431
till all manner of sea creatures
became acclimated to his presence.

641
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:38,195
On the fourth morning,
he roped a couple of sea turtles,

642
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:40,555
lashed them together
and made a raft.

643
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:45,829
- He roped a couple of sea turtles.
- Aye.

644
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,230
What did he use for rope?

645
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,430
Human hair.

646
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,909
From my back.

647
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,310
- Let go the anchor!
- Lower the anchor line!

648
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,579
Young Mr. Turner and I are to go ashore.

649
01:05:04,614 --> 01:05:05,759
Young Mr. Turner and I are to go ashore.

650
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:07,389
Captain.

651
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:09,914
What if the worst should happen?

652
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,151
- Keep to the Code.
- Aye. The Code.

653
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:42,797
- Ten years of hoarding swag.
- Now we finally get to spend it.

654
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:52,313
Once we're quit of the curse,
we'll be rich men...

655
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:56,555
and you can buy an eye
that fits and is made of glass.

656
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:59,473
This one does splinter
something terrible.

657
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:02,391
Stop rubbing it.

658
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:23,438
What code is Gibbs to keep to
if the worst should happen?

659
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:25,715
Pirates' Code.

660
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:29,475
Any man who falls behind
is left behind.

661
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,950
No heroes amongst thieves.

662
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:36,430
For having such a bleak outlook
on pirates

663
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:38,875
you're well on your way
to becoming one.

664
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:42,633
Sprung a man from jail,

665
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:45,029
commandeered a ship of the fleet,

666
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:47,714
sailed with a buccaneer crew
out of Tortuga...

667
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:52,592
and you're completely obsessed
with treasure.

668
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,876
That's not true. I am not obsessed
with treasure.

669
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:08,394
Not all treasure is silver
and gold, mate.

670
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:11,438
Gentlemen, the time has come!

671
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,988
Salvation is nigh!

672
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:18,390
- Our torment is nearing an end!
- Elizabeth.

673
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:20,910
For ten years
we've been tested and tried

674
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:26,028
and each man here has proved his mettle
a hundred times over

675
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:28,350
and a hundred times again!

676
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:32,474
Suffered, I have!

677
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:38,829
Punished we were, the lot of us,
disproportionate to our crime!

678
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,318
Here it is!

679
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:48,876
The cursed treasure of Corts himself.

680
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:54,952
Every last piece that went astray,
we have returned.

681
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,239
Save for this!

682
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:00,073
- Jack!
- Not yet.

683
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:02,910
We wait for the opportune moment.

684
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:10,397
When's that? When it's of greatest
profit to you?

685
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,994
May I ask you something?

686
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:15,469
Have I ever given you reason
not to trust me?

687
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:21,668
Do us a favor. I know it's difficult
for you, but please stay here.

688
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,990
And try not to do anything stupid.

689
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:30,868
Who among us has paid the blood
sacrifice owed to the heathen gods?

690
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:34,509
- Us!
- And whose blood must yet be paid?

691
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,192
Hers!

692
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:42,711
You know the first thing I'm going to do
after the curse is lifted?

693
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:48,157
Eat a whole bushel of apples!

694
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:57,591
Begun by blood.

695
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:59,591
By blood undone.

696
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:07,275
Sorry, Jack.
I'm not going to be your leverage.

697
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:18,429
That's it?

698
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:19,953
Waste not.

699
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:57,554
Did it work?

700
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:00,438
- I don't feel no different.
- How do we tell?

701
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:09,669
You're not dead!

702
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,239
No.

703
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:14,990
- He shot me.
- It didn't work.

704
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:17,514
The curse is still upon us!

705
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,195
You! Maid! Your father,
what was his name?

706
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:26,430
Was your father William Turner?

707
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:28,155
No.

708
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:31,437
Where's his child who sailed
from England eight years ago?

709
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:34,990
The child in whose veins flows
the blood of William Turner? Where?

710
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:45,958
You two!
You brought us the wrong person!

711
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,479
No!

712
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,279
She had the medallion.
She's the proper age.

713
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:54,352
She said her name was Turner.
You heard her.

714
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:57,835
I think she lied to us.

715
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:01,430
You brought us here for nothing.

716
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:05,433
I won't take questioning,
not from the likes of you, Master Twigg.

717
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:09,593
Who's to blame him? Your decisions
have led us from bad to worse!

718
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,194
It was you who sent Bootstrap
to the depths!

719
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,434
And it's you who brought us here
in the first place!

720
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:26,119
If any coward here dare challenge me,
let him speak!

721
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:31,356
I say we cut her throat
and spill all her blood. Just in case.

722
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:32,839
Yeah!

723
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,953
The medallion! She's taken it!

724
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:47,669
Get after her, you feckless pack
of ingrates!

725
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,994
- Where are the oars?
- There's no oars!

726
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,878
The oars have gone missing!
Find them!

727
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,033
You!

728
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:13,398
- You're supposed to be dead.
- Am I not?

729
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:25,151
Pearlie...

730
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,950
Palu-li-la-la-lulu...

731
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,312
Parlili...

732
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,834
Parsnip... Parsley...

733
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:37,070
Partner...

734
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:39,594
- Parley?
- That's the one! Parley!

735
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:41,229
Parley!

736
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:43,151
Parley?

737
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:47,435
Damn to the depths whatever muttonhead
thought of parley!

738
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:50,671
That would be the French.

739
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:05,358
- Not more pirates.
- Welcome aboard, Miss Elizabeth.

740
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:07,715
Mr. Gibbs?

741
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:10,715
Hey, boy, where be Jack?

742
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:13,189
Jack Sparrow?

743
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:16,831
He fell behind.

744
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:25,714
Keep to the Code.

745
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,473
Weigh anchor! Hoist the sails!

746
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,471
Split-quick, you dibbies!

747
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:38,913
How the blazes did you get
off that island?

748
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:43,676
When you marooned me
on that godforsaken spit of land,

749
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:46,035
you forgot one very important thing.

750
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:49,791
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

751
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:54,478
Well, I won't be making
that mistake again.

752
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:58,796
Gents, you all remember
Captain Jack Sparrow?

753
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:00,472
Aye.

754
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:02,551
Kill him.

755
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:05,952
The girl's blood didn't work, did it?

756
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:09,676
Hold your fire!

757
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,668
You know whose blood we need.

758
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:21,880
I know whose blood you need.

759
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:30,428
What sort of a man
trades a man's life for a ship?

760
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,431
A pirate.

761
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:35,832
Here. Let me.

762
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:37,831
Thank you.

763
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,996
You said you gave Barbossa
my name as yours.

764
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,111
Why?

765
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:49,031
I don't know.

766
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:52,392
I'm sorry. A blacksmith's hands.

767
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:56,837
- They're rough.
- No. I mean, yes, they are, but...

768
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:02,031
Don't stop.

769
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,473
Elizabeth.

770
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,671
It's yours.

771
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:34,516
I thought I'd lost it
the day they rescued me.

772
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:37,910
It was a gift from my father.
He sent it to me.

773
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:45,876
Why did you take it?

774
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:49,508
Because I was afraid
that you were a pirate.

775
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:53,151
That would've been awful.

776
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:59,352
It wasn't your blood they needed.

777
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:03,591
It was my father's blood.

778
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:07,470
My blood.

779
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:15,636
- The blood of a pirate.
- Will, I'm so sorry. Please forgive me.

780
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,510
So you expect to leave me on some beach

781
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:33,478
with nothing but a name
and your word it's the one I need,

782
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:37,109
and watch you
sail away in my ship.

783
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:38,315
No.

784
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:42,359
I expect to leave you standing on some
beach with absolutely no name at all,

785
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:47,275
watching me sail away on my ship, and
then I'll shout the name back to you.

786
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:48,554
Savvy?

787
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:51,279
But that still leaves me
standing on some beach,

788
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:55,319
with naught but a name and
your word it's the one I need.

789
01:16:56,360 --> 01:17:01,354
Of the two of us, I am the only one
who hasn't committed mutiny.

790
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:05,228
Therefore, my word
is the one we'll be trusting.

791
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:09,677
Although, I suppose I should be
thanking you because, in fact,

792
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:12,752
if you hadn't betrayed me
and left me to die,

793
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:17,356
I would have an equal share
in that curse, same as you.

794
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:19,670
Funny old world, isn't it?

795
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:24,594
Captain! We're coming up
on the Interceptor.

796
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:39,151
I'm having a thought here, Barbossa.

797
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:43,349
What say we run up a flag of truce,
I scurry over to the Interceptor,

798
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:46,591
and I negotiate the return
of your medallion?

799
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:51,070
Now that's exactly the attitude
that lost you the Pearl.

800
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:53,799
People are easier to search
when they're dead.

801
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,871
Lock him in the brig.

802
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:10,317
Hands aloft to loose ta'gallants!

803
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:13,597
With this wind,
she'll carry every sail we've got.

804
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:17,275
- What's happening?
- The Black Pearl is gaining on us!

805
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:23,879
This is the fastest ship
in the Caribbean.

806
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:26,190
Tell them that after they've caught us.

807
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:29,195
- We're shallower on the draft, right?
- Aye.

808
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:31,396
Then can't we lose them
on those shoals?

809
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:35,758
We don't have to outrun 'em long.
Just long enough.

810
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:38,070
Lighten the ship!
Stem to stern!

811
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:41,197
Anything we can afford to lose,
see that it's lost!

812
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:52,111
Apparently, there's a leak.

813
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:09,232
Haul on the main brace!
Make ready the guns!

814
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:11,951
And run out the sweeps.

815
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:40,751
We're gonna need that.

816
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:51,233
It was a good plan, up till now.

817
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:52,673
Gibbs!

818
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:56,196
We have to make a stand.
We must fight!

819
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,436
- Load the guns!
- With what?

820
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:01,956
Anything! Everything!
Anything we have left.

821
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:05,757
Load the guns!

822
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:09,071
Case shot and langrage!
Nails and crushed glass!

823
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,431
With a will!

824
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:36,032
The Pearl will luff up
on our port quarter.

825
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:38,554
She'll rake us
without presenting a target.

826
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:41,074
Lower the anchor on the right side.

827
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:43,355
On the starboard side!

828
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:47,194
- It has the element of surprise.
- You're daft, lady. You both are.

829
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:49,436
Daft like Jack.

830
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:51,317
Lower the starboard anchor!

831
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:54,956
Do it, you gobs, or it's you
we'll load into the cannons!

832
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:15,071
Let go!

833
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:22,549
They're club hauling.

834
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:24,790
Hard a port! Rack the starboard oars!

835
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,518
Hard a port!

836
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:39,311
Keep her steady, man.

837
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:47,078
- Now!
- Fire!

838
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:49,037
Fire all!

839
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:59,351
Stop blowing holes in my ship!

840
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:47,749
- We need more ideas, lass!
- It's your turn!

841
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:50,917
- We need us a devil's dowry!
- We'll give them her!

842
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:54,310
She's not what they're after.

843
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:57,074
The medallion.

844
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:20,793
Strike your colors,
you bloomin' cockroaches!

845
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:23,474
Hands, grapnels at the ready!

846
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:25,471
Prepare to board!

847
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:00,555
Pistols and cutlasses, men!

848
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:03,279
Koehler, Twigg, to the powder magazine!

849
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:06,352
And the rest of you,
bring me the medallion!

850
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:35,989
Below!

851
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:55,995
Thanks very much.

852
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:10,678
Jack!

853
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:12,799
Bloody empty!

854
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:29,993
That's not very nice.

855
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:36,550
- Where is the medallion?
- Wretch!

856
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:41,955
Where is dear William?

857
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:44,074
Will.

858
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:48,359
Elizabeth!

859
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:53,232
Monkey!

860
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:00,432
I can't move it!

861
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:04,797
Elizabeth!

862
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:19,269
- Thank you, Jack.
- You're welcome.

863
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:21,828
Not you. We named the monkey Jack.

864
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,878
Gents! Our hope is restored!

865
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:04,234
Any of you so much
as thinks the word "parley",

866
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:06,959
I'll have your guts for garters!

867
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:15,875
Will.

868
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,391
You godless pirate!

869
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:20,512
Welcome back, miss.

870
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:23,194
You took advantage of our hospitality
last time.

871
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:26,636
It holds fair now you return the favor.

872
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:33,155
Barbossa!

873
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:36,877
Will.

874
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:40,676
She goes free!

875
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:42,990
What's in your head, boy?

876
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:45,517
She goes free.

877
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:48,672
You've only got one shot,
and we can't die.

878
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:51,913
Don't do anything stupid.

879
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:55,989
You can't. I can.

880
01:27:57,680 --> 01:28:00,148
Like that.

881
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:03,630
- Who are you?
- No one. He's no one.

882
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:06,757
A distant cousin of my aunt's
nephew, twice removed.

883
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:08,956
Lovely singing voice, though. Eunuch.

884
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:13,318
My name is Will Turner!
My father was Bootstrap Bill Turner.

885
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:15,834
His blood runs in my veins.

886
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,913
It's the spitting image of old
Bootstrap Bill come back to haunt us.

887
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,877
On my word, do as I say,

888
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:25,953
or I'll pull this trigger,
and be lost to Davy Jones' locker!

889
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:29,155
Name your terms, Mr. Turner.

890
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:31,959
- Elizabeth goes free!
- Yes, we know that one.

891
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:33,951
Anything else?

892
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:39,270
And the crew. The crew
are not to be harmed.

893
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,999
Agreed.

894
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:07,592
Barbossa, you lying bastard.
You swore she'd go free.

895
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:11,514
Don't dare impugn me honor, boy.
I agreed she'd go free.

896
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:14,433
It was you who failed to specify
when or where.

897
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:24,672
Though it does seem a shame to lose
something so fine, don't it, lads?

898
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:28,718
So I'll be havin' that dress back
before you go.

899
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:34,910
I always liked you.

900
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:40,030
Goes with your black heart.

901
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:42,991
It's still warm.

902
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:47,876
Off you go.

903
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:50,351
Come on.

904
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:54,912
Too long.

905
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:06,909
I'd really rather hoped
we were past all this.

906
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:11,352
Jack. Jack!

907
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:13,919
Did you not notice?

908
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:18,391
That be the same island that we made
you governor of on our last little trip.

909
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:20,915
I did notice.

910
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:25,079
Perhaps you'll be able to conjure up
another miraculous escape.

911
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:27,071
But I doubt it.

912
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:31,795
Off you go.

913
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:34,269
Last time you left me a pistol
with one shot.

914
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:38,069
By the powers, you're right.
Where be Jack's pistol?

915
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:40,071
Bring it forward.

916
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:47,275
Seeing as there's two of us, a gentleman
would give us a pair of pistols.

917
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:51,751
It'll be one pistol as before, and you
can be the gentleman and shoot the lady,

918
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:54,308
and starve to death yourself.

919
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:20,476
That's the second time
I've watched that man take my ship.

920
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:26,833
You were marooned on this island before.
We can escape in the same way.

921
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,719
To what point and purpose, young missy?

922
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:35,432
The Black Pearl is gone. Unless you have
a lot of sails hidden in that bodice...

923
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,272
Unlikely.

924
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:40,591
...young Mr. Turner will be dead
long before you can reach him.

925
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:44,790
But you're Captain Jack Sparrow.

926
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:49,152
You vanished from under the eyes of
seven agents of the East India Company.

927
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:51,834
You sacked Nassau port
without even firing a shot.

928
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:54,718
Are you the pirate
I've read about or not?

929
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:58,272
How did you escape last time?

930
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:08,958
Last time I was here
a grand total of three days.

931
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:11,633
Last time...

932
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:15,991
the rum runners
used this island as a cache.

933
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:18,913
They came by and I was able
to barter passage off.

934
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,356
From the looks of things,
they've long been out of business.

935
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:27,309
You probably have your bloody friend
Norrington to thank for that.

936
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:29,311
So that's it, then?

937
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:33,629
That's the secret, grand adventure
of the infamous Jack Sparrow.

938
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:38,753
You spent three days
lying on a beach drinking rum.

939
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:44,635
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.

940
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:55,517
<i>We're devils, we're black sheep</i>
<i>We're really bad eggs</i>

941
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:57,511
<i>Drink up, me hearties, yo ho</i>

942
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:59,559
<i>Yo ho, yo ho</i>

943
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:02,074
<i>A pirate's life for me</i>

944
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:03,991
I love this song!

945
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:08,916
Really bad eggs!

946
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:15,471
When I get the Pearl back,

947
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:19,553
I'm gonna teach it to the whole crew,
and we'll sing it all the time.

948
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:23,235
You will be the most fearsome pirates
in the Spanish Main.

949
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:25,231
Not just the Spanish Main, love.

950
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:29,351
The entire ocean.
The entire world!

951
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:33,710
Wherever we want to go, we go.
That's what a ship is.

952
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:36,473
It's not just a keel and a hull
and a deck and sails.

953
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:39,870
That's what a ship needs.
But what a ship is...

954
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:44,949
What the Black Pearl really is...

955
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:47,671
is freedom.

956
01:33:49,640 --> 01:33:50,629
Jack...

957
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:55,350
It must be really terrible for you
to be trapped on this island.

958
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:57,195
Oh, yes.

959
01:33:57,280 --> 01:34:01,592
But the company is infinitely better
than last time.

960
01:34:01,680 --> 01:34:06,549
And the scenery has definitely improved.

961
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:08,039
Mr. Sparrow!

962
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:11,999
I'm not entirely sure I've had enough
rum to allow that kind of talk.

963
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:15,511
I know exactly what you mean, love.

964
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:23,999
To freedom!

965
01:34:26,640 --> 01:34:28,551
To the Black Pearl!

966
01:34:56,360 --> 01:34:57,349
No!

967
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:00,319
Not good! Stop!

968
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:02,516
Not good! What are you doing?

969
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:05,239
You've burned all the food,
the shade, the rum.

970
01:35:05,320 --> 01:35:08,517
- Yes, the rum is gone.
- Why is the rum gone?

971
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:12,991
One, because it is a vile drink that
turns respectable men into scoundrels.

972
01:35:13,320 --> 01:35:16,278
Two, that signal
is over 1,000 feet high.

973
01:35:16,360 --> 01:35:18,510
The entire Royal Navy is looking for me.

974
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:22,036
Do you think there is the slightest
chance they won't see it?

975
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:23,633
But why is the rum gone?

976
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:28,310
Just wait, Captain Sparrow.
You give it one hour, maybe two,

977
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:32,279
keep a weather eye open, and you
will see white sails on that horizon.

978
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:42,279
"Must've been terrible for you
to be trapped here, Jack."

979
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:44,271
Well, it bloody is now!

980
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:53,994
There'll be no living with her
after this.

981
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:55,957
- But we've got to save Will.
- No.

982
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:59,476
You're safe now. We will return
to Port Royal immediately,

983
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:01,471
not go gallivanting after pirates.

984
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:03,471
Then we condemn him to death.

985
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:09,639
The boy's fate is regrettable, but
so is his decision to engage in piracy.

986
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:12,792
To rescue me. To prevent anything
from happening to me.

987
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:16,998
If I may be so bold as to interject
my professional opinion.

988
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:22,518
The Pearl was listing to scuppers after
the battle. She won't make good time.

989
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:26,354
Think about it. The Black Pearl.

990
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:30,069
The last real pirate threat
in the Caribbean, mate.

991
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:33,109
How can you pass that up?

992
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:38,672
By remembering that I serve others,
Mr. Sparrow, not only myself.

993
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:42,230
Commodore, I beg you,
please do this for me.

994
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:44,356
As a wedding gift.

995
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:46,510
Elizabeth?

996
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:49,034
Are you accepting
the Commodore's proposal?

997
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:52,789
I am.

998
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:56,590
A wedding. I love weddings.
Drinks all around!

999
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:01,439
I know. "Clap him in irons," right?

1000
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:07,919
Mr. Sparrow, you will accompany
these fine men to the helm

1001
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:11,276
and provide us with a bearing
to Isla de Muerta.

1002
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:17,117
Then contemplate all possible meanings
of the phrase "silent as the grave".

1003
01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:20,835
- Do I make myself clear?
- Inescapably clear.

1004
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:27,870
Shiver me timbers.

1005
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:29,916
Cotton here says you missed a bit.

1006
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:37,157
You knew William Turner.

1007
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:40,118
Old Bootstrap Bill, we knew him.

1008
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:43,755
Never sat well with Bootstrap, what we
did to Jack Sparrow, the mutiny and all.

1009
01:37:43,790 --> 01:37:46,391
Never sat well with Bootstrap, what we
did to Jack Sparrow, the mutiny and all.

1010
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:50,438
He said it wasn't right with the Code.

1011
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:53,398
That's why he sent off
a piece of the treasure to you.

1012
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:57,310
He said we deserved to be cursed,

1013
01:37:58,440 --> 01:38:00,431
and remain cursed.

1014
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:03,318
- Stupid blighter.
- Good man.

1015
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:08,872
But, as you can imagine, that didn't
sit too well with the Captain.

1016
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:11,599
That didn't sit too well
with the Captain at all.

1017
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:15,150
- Tell him what Barbossa did.
- I'm telling the story!

1018
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:24,079
So what the captain did, he strapped
a cannon to Bootstrap's bootstraps.

1019
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:25,593
Bootstrap's bootstraps!

1020
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:30,959
Last we saw of old Bill Turner, he was
sinking into the crushin' black oblivion

1021
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:34,077
of Davy Jones' locker!

1022
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:39,391
It was only after that we learned
we needed his blood to lift the curse.

1023
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:41,710
That's what you call ironic.

1024
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:48,311
Bring him.

1025
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,991
I don't care for the situation.

1026
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:59,471
Any attempt to storm the caves
could turn into an ambush.

1027
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:02,757
Not if you're the one
doing the ambushing.

1028
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:06,355
I go in and get Barbossa to send
his men out in their little boats.

1029
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:12,276
Your mates return to the Dauntless
and blast them with your cannons.

1030
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:14,555
What do you have to lose?

1031
01:39:14,640 --> 01:39:17,518
Nothing I'd lament being rid of.

1032
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:23,196
Now, to be honest, there's a risk
to those aboard the Dauntless,

1033
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:27,034
which includes the future Mrs. Commodore.

1034
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:30,999
- It's for your own safety.
- I don't care, I have to tell him!

1035
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:34,072
The pirates are cursed!
They can't be killed!

1036
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:40,156
He's already informed of that. A mermaid
flopped up on deck and told the story.

1037
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:43,118
This is Jack Sparrow's doing!

1038
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:57,233
No reason to fret. A prick of the
finger, a few drops of blood...

1039
01:39:57,320 --> 01:40:02,519
No mistakes this time. He's only
half-Turner. We spill it all!

1040
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:07,280
Guess there is reason to fret.

1041
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:25,833
- Beg your pardon.
- Begun by blood. By blood...

1042
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:30,552
Jack!

1043
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:33,598
- It's not possible.
- Not probable.

1044
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:36,316
Where's Elizabeth?

1045
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:41,708
Safe, like I promised. She's set to
marry Norrington, like she promised,

1046
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:44,109
and you get to die for her
like you promised.

1047
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:49,399
So we're all men of our word, except
for Elizabeth, who is a woman.

1048
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:51,869
Shut up! You're next!

1049
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:58,910
- You don't want to be doing that.
- No, I think I do.

1050
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:02,436
Your funeral.

1051
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:09,069
- Why don't I want to be doing it?
- Because...

1052
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:14,670
The HMS Dauntless,
pride of the Royal Navy,

1053
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:19,356
is floating just offshore
waiting for you.

1054
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:29,590
What are we doing here?

1055
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:33,631
The pirates come out,
unprepared and unawares.

1056
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:39,078
We catch 'em in a crossfire
and send 'em down to see Old Hob.

1057
01:41:39,720 --> 01:41:45,909
I meant, why aren't we doing
what Mr. Sparrow said we should do?

1058
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:50,710
- With the cannons and all?
- Because it was Mr. Sparrow who said it.

1059
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:55,109
You think he wasn't telling the truth?

1060
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:57,868
Hear me out, mate.

1061
01:41:57,960 --> 01:42:01,748
Order your men to row out to the
Dauntless, they do what they do best,

1062
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:06,118
Robert's your uncle, Fanny's your
aunt... There you are with two ships.

1063
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:08,316
The makings of your own fleet.

1064
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:11,870
You'll take the grandest as your
flagship and who's to argue?

1065
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:14,793
But what of the Pearl?

1066
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:19,476
Name me captain, I'll sail under your
colors and give you 10% of me plunder

1067
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:26,033
and you get to introduce yourself
as Commodore Barbossa. Savvy?

1068
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:29,908
And in exchange you want me
not to kill the whelp.

1069
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:34,949
Not at all. By all means,
kill the whelp. Just not yet.

1070
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:39,750
Wait to lift the curse
until the opportune moment.

1071
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:44,633
For instance...

1072
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:49,551
after you've killed Norrington's men.

1073
01:42:49,640 --> 01:42:51,153
Every...

1074
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:52,832
last...

1075
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:54,273
one.

1076
01:43:03,640 --> 01:43:07,394
You've planned this ever since
you learned my name.

1077
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:09,798
Yeah.

1078
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:13,190
I want 50% of your plunder.

1079
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:14,429
- 15.
- 40.

1080
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:15,919
25.

1081
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:19,836
I'll buy you the hat.
A really big one.

1082
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:22,352
Commodore.

1083
01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:26,750
We have an accord.

1084
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:29,635
All hands to the boats!

1085
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:33,278
Apologies. You give the orders.

1086
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:37,876
Gents... take a walk!

1087
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:44,910
Not to the boats?

1088
01:44:40,840 --> 01:44:42,796
Hold fire.

1089
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:48,876
This is like what the Greeks
done at Troy.

1090
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:54,430
Except they was in a horse,
instead of dresses. Wooden horse.

1091
01:45:07,120 --> 01:45:09,111
A moment, please.

1092
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:13,752
Elizabeth?

1093
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:21,314
I want you to know I believe you made
a very good decision today.

1094
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:24,348
Couldn't be more proud of you.

1095
01:45:24,440 --> 01:45:29,798
But a good decision, if made for the
wrong reasons, can be a wrong decision.

1096
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:40,038
Lieutenant.

1097
01:45:57,800 --> 01:45:59,552
Elizabeth?

1098
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:03,269
Are you there?

1099
01:46:04,360 --> 01:46:06,828
Are you even listening to me?

1100
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:34,951
What have you done?

1101
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:38,434
Stop that! I already feel like a fool.

1102
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:41,595
You look nice, though.

1103
01:46:45,080 --> 01:46:47,389
I look nice?

1104
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:24,877
I must admit, Jack, I thought
I had you figured

1105
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:28,032
but it turns out you're
a hard man to predict.

1106
01:47:28,120 --> 01:47:32,796
I'm dishonest. And a dishonest man
you can trust to be dishonest.

1107
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:37,192
Honestly, it's the honest ones
you want to watch out for.

1108
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:43,071
You can never predict when they're going
to do something incredibly... stupid.

1109
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:19,038
You're off the edge of the map, mate.
Here there be monsters!

1110
01:48:23,640 --> 01:48:25,312
Right.

1111
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:28,556
What would you eat first?

1112
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:32,633
We should decide now so we're ready
when the time comes.

1113
01:48:56,760 --> 01:48:58,716
What was that?

1114
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:20,795
Miss Elizabeth!

1115
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:42,079
Make for the ship! Move!

1116
01:49:51,120 --> 01:49:52,872
To the ship!

1117
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:57,317
Row, men!

1118
01:50:33,320 --> 01:50:35,197
You can't beat me, Jack.

1119
01:50:58,640 --> 01:51:00,756
That's interesting.

1120
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:12,276
I couldn't resist, mate.

1121
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:16,989
Sorry!

1122
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:27,316
What now, Jack Sparrow?

1123
01:52:27,400 --> 01:52:32,679
Are we to be two immortals, locked
in an epic battle until Judgment Day?

1124
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:35,396
Or you could surrender.

1125
01:53:00,720 --> 01:53:04,110
All of you with me. Will is in that cave
and we must save him.

1126
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:06,668
Ready, and... heave!

1127
01:53:13,080 --> 01:53:14,911
I need your help. Come on!

1128
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,719
Any port in a storm.

1129
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:20,155
Cotton's right. We've got the Pearl.

1130
01:53:20,240 --> 01:53:23,755
- Are you gonna leave Jack?
- Jack owes us a ship.

1131
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:27,072
- There's the Code to consider.
- The Code?

1132
01:53:28,520 --> 01:53:32,593
You're pirates. Hang the Code
and hang the rules!

1133
01:53:32,680 --> 01:53:34,910
They're more like guidelines.

1134
01:53:38,600 --> 01:53:40,636
Bloody pirates!

1135
01:53:51,640 --> 01:53:53,710
Is it supposed to be doing that?

1136
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:56,155
They're stealing our ship.

1137
01:53:56,240 --> 01:53:57,992
Bloody pirates!

1138
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:01,717
Boarders away.

1139
01:54:09,680 --> 01:54:11,432
Come on!

1140
01:54:36,440 --> 01:54:38,351
Me eye!

1141
01:54:56,880 --> 01:54:58,871
I'll teach you the meaning of pain.

1142
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:01,110
You like pain?

1143
01:55:02,160 --> 01:55:04,230
Try wearing a corset.

1144
01:55:13,600 --> 01:55:15,750
Whose side is Jack on?

1145
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:18,070
At the moment?

1146
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:53,477
No fair!

1147
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:19,958
Ten years you carry that pistol
and now you waste your shot.

1148
01:56:20,680 --> 01:56:23,478
He didn't waste it.

1149
01:56:47,160 --> 01:56:49,196
I feel...

1150
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,309
cold.

1151
01:57:54,040 --> 01:57:56,110
Parley?

1152
01:57:56,560 --> 01:58:00,519
- The ship is ours, gentlemen.
- Huzzah!

1153
01:58:06,360 --> 01:58:08,920
Huzzah! Huzzah!

1154
01:58:44,720 --> 01:58:46,676
We should return to the Dauntless.

1155
01:58:49,040 --> 01:58:52,589
Your fianc will want to know
you're safe.

1156
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:05,629
If you were waiting
for the opportune moment...

1157
01:59:05,720 --> 01:59:07,870
that was it.

1158
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:13,271
Now, I'd be much obliged
if you'd drop me off at my ship.

1159
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:19,990
I'm sorry, Jack.

1160
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:26,949
They done what's right by them.
Can't expect more than that.

1161
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:42,996
Jack Sparrow...

1162
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:46,115
Captain Jack Sparrow.

1163
01:59:46,760 --> 01:59:49,832
...for your crimes against the Crown.

1164
01:59:51,120 --> 01:59:55,398
Said crimes being numerous in quantity
and sinister in nature.

1165
01:59:56,080 --> 01:59:59,550
The most egregious of these
to be cited herewith:

1166
01:59:59,640 --> 02:00:02,154
Piracy, smuggling...

1167
02:00:02,240 --> 02:00:04,356
This is wrong.

1168
02:00:04,440 --> 02:00:09,275
Commodore Norrington is bound
by the law, as are we all.

1169
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:12,751
...impersonating an officer
of the Spanish Royal Navy,

1170
02:00:12,840 --> 02:00:16,355
impersonating a cleric
of the Church of England,

1171
02:00:16,440 --> 02:00:21,468
sailing under false colors,
arson, kidnapping, looting,

1172
02:00:21,560 --> 02:00:25,348
poaching, brigandage, pilfering,

1173
02:00:25,440 --> 02:00:29,718
depravity, depredation
and general lawlessness.

1174
02:00:31,280 --> 02:00:37,913
For these crimes, you are sentenced
to be hung by the neck until dead.

1175
02:00:39,200 --> 02:00:41,475
May God have mercy on your soul.

1176
02:00:41,560 --> 02:00:43,630
Governor Swann.

1177
02:00:43,720 --> 02:00:45,597
Commodore.

1178
02:00:46,160 --> 02:00:48,276
Elizabeth.

1179
02:00:48,360 --> 02:00:52,876
I should have told you every day
from the moment I met you...

1180
02:00:54,320 --> 02:00:56,356
I love you.

1181
02:01:09,320 --> 02:01:10,833
Watch yourself!

1182
02:01:11,240 --> 02:01:12,639
Marines!

1183
02:01:12,720 --> 02:01:14,631
I can't breathe.

1184
02:01:15,040 --> 02:01:16,234
Elizabeth!

1185
02:01:19,280 --> 02:01:20,872
Move!

1186
02:02:31,200 --> 02:02:35,512
I thought we might have to endure
some ill-conceived escape attempt,

1187
02:02:35,600 --> 02:02:37,511
but not from you.

1188
02:02:37,600 --> 02:02:40,672
On our return to Port Royal,
I granted you clemency.

1189
02:02:40,760 --> 02:02:45,356
And this is how you thank me?
By throwing in your lot with him?

1190
02:02:45,440 --> 02:02:47,954
- He's a pirate.
- And a good man.

1191
02:02:49,680 --> 02:02:54,629
If this means the hangman will earn two
pairs of boots instead of one, so be it.

1192
02:02:54,720 --> 02:02:56,392
My conscience will be clear.

1193
02:02:56,480 --> 02:02:59,358
You forget your place, Turner.

1194
02:03:01,080 --> 02:03:05,153
It's right here, between you and Jack.

1195
02:03:08,480 --> 02:03:10,710
- As is mine.
- Elizabeth.

1196
02:03:12,200 --> 02:03:15,909
Lower your weapons.
Put them down!

1197
02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:23,633
So this is where your heart truly lies?

1198
02:03:24,920 --> 02:03:26,672
It is.

1199
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:38,476
I'm feeling good about this.

1200
02:03:38,560 --> 02:03:40,869
We've all arrived at a special place.

1201
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:46,034
Spiritually, ecumenically,
grammatically.

1202
02:03:46,840 --> 02:03:50,594
I want you to know
that I was rooting for you, mate.

1203
02:03:50,680 --> 02:03:52,511
Know that.

1204
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:57,670
Elizabeth.

1205
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:02,310
It would never have worked
between us, darling.

1206
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:04,198
I'm sorry.

1207
02:04:06,640 --> 02:04:08,596
Will.

1208
02:04:09,680 --> 02:04:11,989
Nice hat.

1209
02:04:12,680 --> 02:04:14,352
Friends.

1210
02:04:16,600 --> 02:04:21,355
This is the day that you will always
remember as the day that...

1211
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:28,755
Idiot. He's nowhere to go
but back to the noose.

1212
02:04:31,080 --> 02:04:32,832
Sail ho!

1213
02:04:40,120 --> 02:04:42,395
What's your plan of action?

1214
02:04:43,280 --> 02:04:45,032
Sir!

1215
02:04:48,680 --> 02:04:52,229
Perhaps on the rare occasion,
pursuing the right course

1216
02:04:52,320 --> 02:04:54,470
demands an act of piracy.

1217
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:58,316
Piracy itself can be the right course.

1218
02:05:02,640 --> 02:05:04,596
Mr. Turner.

1219
02:05:09,400 --> 02:05:12,233
I will accept the consequences
of my actions.

1220
02:05:17,800 --> 02:05:20,155
This is a beautiful sword.

1221
02:05:22,080 --> 02:05:23,911
I expect the man who made it

1222
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:28,232
to show the same care and devotion
in every aspect of his life.

1223
02:05:30,160 --> 02:05:31,832
Thank you.

1224
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:37,358
Commodore! What about Sparrow?

1225
02:05:39,160 --> 02:05:43,278
I think we can afford to give him
one day's head start.

1226
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:50,355
So...

1227
02:05:50,920 --> 02:05:53,753
This is the path you've chosen, is it?

1228
02:05:55,240 --> 02:05:58,789
After all, he is a blacksmith.

1229
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:01,796
No.

1230
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:07,637
He's a pirate.

1231
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:45,712
Thought you were supposed
to keep to the Code?

1232
02:06:45,800 --> 02:06:49,509
We figured they were more
actual... guidelines.

1233
02:06:53,720 --> 02:06:55,199
Thank you.

1234
02:06:56,240 --> 02:06:58,356
Captain Sparrow.

1235
02:07:01,640 --> 02:07:03,835
The Black Pearl is yours.

1236
02:07:18,400 --> 02:07:23,952
On deck, you scabrous dogs! Hands
to braces! Let go and haul to run free!

1237
02:07:25,480 --> 02:07:28,950
Now... bring me that horizon.

1238
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,560
<i>And really bad eggs</i>

1239
02:07:41,080 --> 02:07:43,389
Drink up, me hearties. Yo ho!
