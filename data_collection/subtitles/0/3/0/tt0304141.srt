1
00:00:11,449 --> 00:00:15,211
Harry Potter 3

2
00:00:30,138 --> 00:00:32,308
Lumos Maxima.

3
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,140
Lumos Maxima.

4
00:00:56,409 --> 00:00:57,970
Lumos Maxima.

5
00:01:00,153 --> 00:01:01,975
Lumos Maxima.

6
00:01:03,866 --> 00:01:05,688
Lumos Maxima!

7
00:01:33,914 --> 00:01:35,408
Harry. Harry.

8
00:01:35,577 --> 00:01:37,488
Harry, open the door.

9
00:01:44,089 --> 00:01:46,326
Marge. How lovely to see...

10
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:49,719
Uncle Vernon,
I need you to sign this form.

11
00:01:49,881 --> 00:01:51,159
What is it?

12
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:53,361
Nothing. School stuff.

13
00:01:53,529 --> 00:01:56,083
Later perhaps, if you behave.

14
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,355
I will if she does.

15
00:01:58,521 --> 00:02:01,555
- Oh, you're still here, are you?
- Yes.

16
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:04,434
Don't say yes
in that ungrateful way.

17
00:02:04,602 --> 00:02:06,489
Damn good of my brother
to keep you.

18
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:10,807
He'd have been straight to an orphanage
if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.

19
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:15,160
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?

20
00:02:15,322 --> 00:02:17,044
Give us a kiss. Come on. Up, up.

21
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,380
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.

22
00:02:19,546 --> 00:02:21,487
Okay.

23
00:02:24,697 --> 00:02:27,480
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.

24
00:02:28,442 --> 00:02:31,290
- Can I tempt you, Marge?
- Just a small one.

25
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,264
Excellent nosh, Petunia.

26
00:02:34,842 --> 00:02:36,750
A bit more.

27
00:02:37,273 --> 00:02:40,502
Usually just a fry-up for me,
what with 12 dogs.

28
00:02:40,665 --> 00:02:43,153
Just a bit more. That's a boy.

29
00:02:46,105 --> 00:02:48,014
You wanna try
a little drop of brandy?

30
00:02:48,185 --> 00:02:52,048
A little drop of brandy-brandy
windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?

31
00:02:53,497 --> 00:02:55,222
What are you smirking at?

32
00:02:55,385 --> 00:02:57,174
Where did you send the boy,
Vernon?

33
00:02:57,337 --> 00:03:00,501
St. Brutus'. It's a fine
institution for hopeless cases.

34
00:03:00,665 --> 00:03:03,567
Do they use a cane
at St. Brutus', boy?

35
00:03:06,874 --> 00:03:08,052
Oh, yeah.

36
00:03:08,218 --> 00:03:10,901
Yeah. I've been beaten
loads of times.

37
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,553
Excellent. I won't have this
namby-pamby...

38
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,755
...wishy-washy nonsense about
not beating people who deserve it.

39
00:03:16,922 --> 00:03:19,889
You mustn't blame yourself
about how this one turned out.

40
00:03:20,058 --> 00:03:23,833
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.

41
00:03:23,994 --> 00:03:26,065
What is it the boy's father did,
Petunia?

42
00:03:26,234 --> 00:03:29,102
Nothing. He didn't work.
He was unemployed.

43
00:03:29,273 --> 00:03:31,990
- And a drunk too, no doubt?
- That's a lie.

44
00:03:32,153 --> 00:03:34,608
- What did you say?
- My dad wasn't a drunk.

45
00:03:37,464 --> 00:03:41,393
Don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.

46
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,316
I think it's time you went to bed.

47
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,579
Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up.

48
00:03:47,706 --> 00:03:50,607
Actually, it's nothing to do
with the father.

49
00:03:50,777 --> 00:03:54,575
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.

50
00:03:54,745 --> 00:03:58,639
If something's wrong with the bitch,
then something's wrong with the pup.

51
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,434
Shut up! Shut up!

52
00:04:05,241 --> 00:04:06,899
Right.

53
00:04:07,066 --> 00:04:09,106
Let me tell you...

54
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:31,730
Vernon!

55
00:04:34,617 --> 00:04:36,372
Vernon! Vernon, do something!

56
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:19,951
Stop!

57
00:05:22,425 --> 00:05:24,881
I've got you, Marge.
I've got you.

58
00:05:28,153 --> 00:05:30,095
- Hold on, hold on.
- Get off.

59
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,045
- Don't you dare!
- Sorry.

60
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,926
Oh, Vernon.

61
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,748
Oh, God.

62
00:05:37,914 --> 00:05:39,636
Marge!

63
00:05:46,425 --> 00:05:48,563
Please!

64
00:05:49,145 --> 00:05:51,249
Marge!

65
00:05:52,313 --> 00:05:55,347
Come back!

66
00:06:18,362 --> 00:06:20,663
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.

67
00:06:20,824 --> 00:06:23,956
- You put her right!
- No. She deserved what she got.

68
00:06:24,377 --> 00:06:27,378
- Keep away from me.
- You can't do magic outside school.

69
00:06:27,577 --> 00:06:30,447
- Yeah? Try me.
- They won't let you back now.

70
00:06:30,617 --> 00:06:31,895
You've nowhere to go.

71
00:06:32,057 --> 00:06:34,294
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.

72
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,277
"Welcome to the Knight Bus...

73
00:08:08,441 --> 00:08:11,670
...emergency transport
for the stranded witch or wizard.

74
00:08:11,832 --> 00:08:16,589
My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be
your conductor for this evening."

75
00:08:20,186 --> 00:08:21,559
What you doing down there?

76
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:24,337
- I fell over.
- What you fell over for?

77
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:27,057
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Well, come on, then.

78
00:08:27,288 --> 00:08:29,362
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.

79
00:08:36,184 --> 00:08:39,120
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.

80
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:40,948
Well, come on, then. In.

81
00:08:41,113 --> 00:08:43,831
No, no, no. I'll get this. You get in.

82
00:08:48,602 --> 00:08:50,707
Come on.

83
00:09:00,184 --> 00:09:02,835
Come on. Move on, move on.

84
00:09:16,986 --> 00:09:20,117
- Take her away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie.

85
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:22,420
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

86
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,828
- What did you say your name was?
- I didn't.

87
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:40,304
- Whereabouts are you headed?
- The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.

88
00:09:40,537 --> 00:09:43,353
You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London."

89
00:09:43,514 --> 00:09:45,750
The Leaky Cauldron.
If you have pea soup...

90
00:09:45,912 --> 00:09:48,597
...make sure you eat it
before it eats you.

91
00:09:51,864 --> 00:09:54,385
- But the Muggles. Can't they see us?
- Muggles?

92
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:56,210
They don't see nothing, do they?

93
00:09:56,376 --> 00:09:58,832
No, but if you jab them
with a fork, they feel.

94
00:10:00,504 --> 00:10:03,439
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!

95
00:10:11,801 --> 00:10:14,223
Ten, nine, eight...

96
00:10:14,457 --> 00:10:17,043
...seven, six, five...

97
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,380
...four, three, three and a half...

98
00:10:19,608 --> 00:10:21,300
...two, one and three quarters.

99
00:10:21,848 --> 00:10:23,376
Yes!

100
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:28,886
Who is that?

101
00:10:29,081 --> 00:10:31,351
That man.

102
00:10:32,953 --> 00:10:34,676
Who is that?

103
00:10:34,873 --> 00:10:36,302
Who is...?

104
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:38,806
That is Sirius Black, that is.

105
00:10:39,353 --> 00:10:42,484
Don't tell me you've never
been hearing of Sirius Black.

106
00:10:43,737 --> 00:10:45,909
He's a murderer.

107
00:10:46,073 --> 00:10:48,593
Got himself locked up
in Azkaban for it.

108
00:10:49,241 --> 00:10:52,503
- How did he escape?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?

109
00:10:52,664 --> 00:10:54,553
He's the first one that done it.

110
00:10:55,481 --> 00:10:58,001
He was a big supporter of...

111
00:10:58,488 --> 00:10:59,918
...You-Know-Who.

112
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:02,390
I reckon you've heard of him.

113
00:11:02,553 --> 00:11:04,080
Yeah.

114
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:05,526
Him I've heard of.

115
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,674
Ernie, two double-deckers
at 12 o'clock.

116
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,753
They're getting closer, Ernie.

117
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:15,668
Ernie, they're right on top of us!

118
00:11:22,745 --> 00:11:25,079
Mind your head.

119
00:11:29,752 --> 00:11:31,641
Hey, guys? Guys?

120
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,905
Why the long faces?

121
00:11:39,512 --> 00:11:41,848
Yeah, yeah.
Nearly there. Nearly there.

122
00:11:47,064 --> 00:11:50,294
- The Leaky Cauldron.
- Next stop, Knockturn Alley.

123
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:54,130
Mr. Potter, at last.

124
00:11:57,018 --> 00:11:59,635
- Take it away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie!

125
00:12:21,881 --> 00:12:23,637
Room 11.

126
00:12:26,104 --> 00:12:27,381
Hedwig.

127
00:12:27,544 --> 00:12:30,261
Right smart bird
you got there, Mr. Potter.

128
00:12:30,425 --> 00:12:33,971
He arrived here just
five minutes before yourself.

129
00:12:35,801 --> 00:12:39,282
As Minister for Magic, it is my duty
to inform you, Mr. Potter...

130
00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:42,516
...earlier this evening
your uncle's sister was located...

131
00:12:42,681 --> 00:12:46,477
...a little south of Sheffield,
circling a chimney stack.

132
00:12:46,648 --> 00:12:50,227
The Accidental Magic Reversal
Department was dispatched immediately.

133
00:12:50,393 --> 00:12:54,997
She has been properly punctured
and her memory modified.

134
00:12:55,224 --> 00:12:59,698
She will have no recollection
of the incident whatsoever.

135
00:12:59,866 --> 00:13:02,353
So that's that...

136
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,271
...and no harm done.

137
00:13:05,912 --> 00:13:07,189
Pea soup?

138
00:13:07,352 --> 00:13:09,392
No, thank you.

139
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,666
- Minister?
- Yes?

140
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,524
- I don't understand.
- Understand?

141
00:13:13,688 --> 00:13:17,072
I broke the law. Underage wizards
can't use magic at home.

142
00:13:17,305 --> 00:13:20,173
Come now. The Ministry
doesn't send people to Azkaban...

143
00:13:20,344 --> 00:13:22,767
...for blowing up their aunts.

144
00:13:26,584 --> 00:13:30,928
On the other hand, running away
like that, given the state of things...

145
00:13:31,098 --> 00:13:33,464
...was very, very irresponsible.

146
00:13:33,657 --> 00:13:37,269
- "The state of things," sir?
- We have a killer on the loose.

147
00:13:37,433 --> 00:13:39,189
Sirius Black, you mean?

148
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:41,044
But what's he got to do with me?

149
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:47,862
Nothing, of course. You're safe.
And that's what matters.

150
00:13:48,088 --> 00:13:51,055
And tomorrow you'll be
on your way back to Hogwarts.

151
00:13:51,225 --> 00:13:54,072
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty...

152
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:58,062
...of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.

153
00:14:02,777 --> 00:14:04,022
Hedwig.

154
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,983
Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're
here, it would be best if you didn't...

155
00:14:09,272 --> 00:14:11,640
...wander.

156
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:15,927
Right! You gonna move
that bus or what?

157
00:15:31,481 --> 00:15:33,422
Housekeeping.

158
00:15:36,729 --> 00:15:38,868
I'll come back later.

159
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:47,510
I'm warning you, Hermione.

160
00:15:47,672 --> 00:15:51,217
Keep that beast away from Scabbers,
or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.

161
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,391
It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?

162
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,430
- It's in his nature.
- A cat? Is that what they told you?

163
00:15:56,601 --> 00:15:59,022
- Looks like a pig with hair.
- That's rich...

164
00:15:59,193 --> 00:16:01,613
...coming from the owner
of that smelly old shoe brush.

165
00:16:01,785 --> 00:16:04,174
Crookshanks, just ignore
the mean little boy.

166
00:16:04,344 --> 00:16:05,838
Harry.

167
00:16:06,873 --> 00:16:08,247
Harry.

168
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:12,304
- Egypt. What's it like?
- Brilliant. Loads of old stuff...

169
00:16:12,536 --> 00:16:15,700
...like mummies, tombs,
even Scabbers enjoyed himself.

170
00:16:15,928 --> 00:16:18,962
- Egyptians used to worship cats.
- Along with the dung beetle.

171
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:22,162
- Not flashing that clipping again?
- I haven't shown anyone.

172
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:24,631
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.

173
00:16:24,793 --> 00:16:26,168
- The day maid.
- Night maid.

174
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:28,336
- Cook.
- The bloke who fixed the toilet.

175
00:16:28,505 --> 00:16:29,878
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.

176
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,113
- Good to see you, dear.
- Good to see you.

177
00:16:32,281 --> 00:16:33,558
- Got everything?
- Yes.

178
00:16:33,721 --> 00:16:35,793
- Yes? All your books?
- It's all upstairs.

179
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,302
- Your clothes?
- Everything.

180
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:38,673
- Good boy.
- Thank you.

181
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,783
- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Weasley.

182
00:16:40,953 --> 00:16:44,301
- Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sure.

183
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:47,025
- Hermione.
- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.

184
00:16:47,192 --> 00:16:50,673
- Looking forward to a new term?
- Yeah. It should be great.

185
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:57,301
Harry, some within the Ministry
would strongly discourage me...

186
00:16:57,465 --> 00:17:00,017
...from divulging what I'm about
to reveal to you.

187
00:17:00,184 --> 00:17:03,380
But I think that you need
to know the facts.

188
00:17:03,545 --> 00:17:06,033
You are in danger.

189
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,047
Grave danger.

190
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,048
Has this anything to do
with Sirius Black, sir?

191
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:15,127
What do you know
about Sirius Black, Harry?

192
00:17:15,288 --> 00:17:18,834
- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?

193
00:17:19,513 --> 00:17:22,197
Thirteen years ago,
when you stopped...

194
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,116
- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.

195
00:17:24,281 --> 00:17:25,557
Sorry.

196
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,503
When you stopped You-Know-Who...

197
00:17:28,664 --> 00:17:30,226
...Black lost everything.

198
00:17:30,392 --> 00:17:34,516
But to this day, he still remains
a faithful servant.

199
00:17:34,681 --> 00:17:36,753
And in his mind...

200
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,789
...you are the only thing
that stands in the way...

201
00:17:39,961 --> 00:17:43,538
...of You-Know-Who
returning to power.

202
00:17:43,736 --> 00:17:45,777
And that is why...

203
00:17:45,945 --> 00:17:48,399
...he has escaped from Azkaban.

204
00:17:48,728 --> 00:17:50,355
To find you.

205
00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:53,329
And kill me.

206
00:17:54,233 --> 00:17:56,785
Harry, swear to me
that whatever you might hear...

207
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:59,374
...you won't go looking for Black.

208
00:17:59,768 --> 00:18:01,044
Mr. Weasley...

209
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:05,038
...why would I go looking
for someone who wants to kill me?

210
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:07,476
Quick. Quick.

211
00:18:07,641 --> 00:18:09,397
Ron, Ron!

212
00:18:10,072 --> 00:18:12,080
Oh, for goodness' sake!

213
00:18:12,281 --> 00:18:14,647
Don't lose him!

214
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,615
I didn't mean to blow her up. I just...

215
00:18:17,816 --> 00:18:20,151
- I lost control.
- Brilliant.

216
00:18:20,312 --> 00:18:23,759
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.

217
00:18:23,929 --> 00:18:25,586
I was lucky not to be arrested.

218
00:18:25,752 --> 00:18:27,695
I still think it was brilliant.

219
00:18:28,281 --> 00:18:30,517
Come on. Everywhere else is full.

220
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,550
Who do you think that is?

221
00:18:34,711 --> 00:18:37,462
- Professor R.J. Lupin.
- Do you know everything?

222
00:18:37,624 --> 00:18:39,664
How is it she knows everything?

223
00:18:39,832 --> 00:18:42,832
- It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
- Oh.

224
00:18:43,129 --> 00:18:46,259
- Do you think he's really asleep?
- Seems to be. Why?

225
00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:49,968
I gotta tell you something.

226
00:19:02,872 --> 00:19:05,971
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban...

227
00:19:06,137 --> 00:19:07,991
...to come after you?
- Yeah.

228
00:19:08,152 --> 00:19:09,975
But they'll catch Black, won't they?

229
00:19:10,136 --> 00:19:12,819
- I mean, everyone's looking for him.
- Sure.

230
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:16,181
Except no one's ever broken out
of Azkaban before...

231
00:19:16,343 --> 00:19:20,020
...and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
- Thanks, Ron.

232
00:19:21,432 --> 00:19:22,959
Why are we stopping?

233
00:19:23,993 --> 00:19:25,650
We can't be there yet.

234
00:19:29,688 --> 00:19:31,859
What's going on?

235
00:19:32,056 --> 00:19:34,610
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.

236
00:19:36,472 --> 00:19:38,708
Ouch, Ron. That was my foot.

237
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:41,399
There's something moving out there.

238
00:19:54,425 --> 00:19:57,326
I think someone's coming aboard.

239
00:20:21,497 --> 00:20:24,246
Bloody hell! What's happening?

240
00:21:33,431 --> 00:21:34,774
Harry.

241
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,589
Harry, are you all right?

242
00:21:43,513 --> 00:21:45,105
Thank you.

243
00:21:46,233 --> 00:21:48,566
Here, eat this. It'll help.

244
00:21:49,048 --> 00:21:51,087
It's all right. It's chocolate.

245
00:21:57,145 --> 00:21:59,119
What was that thing that came?

246
00:21:59,288 --> 00:22:02,584
It was a dementor. One of the guards
of Azkaban. It's gone now.

247
00:22:02,745 --> 00:22:05,330
It was searching the train
for Sirius Black.

248
00:22:05,497 --> 00:22:08,977
If you'll excuse me, I need to have
a little word with the driver.

249
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:16,182
Eat. You'll feel better.

250
00:22:21,753 --> 00:22:23,028
What happened to me?

251
00:22:23,191 --> 00:22:24,850
Well, you sort of went rigid.

252
00:22:25,015 --> 00:22:28,050
We thought maybe you were
having a fit or something.

253
00:22:29,752 --> 00:22:31,443
And did either of you two...

254
00:22:31,639 --> 00:22:32,883
...you know...

255
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,016
...pass out?
- No.

256
00:22:36,184 --> 00:22:37,810
I felt weird, though.

257
00:22:37,977 --> 00:22:39,732
Like I'd never be cheerful again.

258
00:22:40,952 --> 00:22:43,057
But someone was screaming.

259
00:22:43,225 --> 00:22:44,534
A woman.

260
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,373
No one was screaming, Harry.

261
00:23:44,153 --> 00:23:47,894
Welcome! Welcome to another year
at Hogwarts.

262
00:23:48,057 --> 00:23:49,998
Now, I'd like to say a few words...

263
00:23:50,169 --> 00:23:54,324
...before we all become too befuddled
by our excellent feast.

264
00:23:54,488 --> 00:23:57,652
First, I'm pleased to welcome
Professor R.J. Lupin...

265
00:23:57,817 --> 00:24:00,151
...who's kindly consented
to fill the post...

266
00:24:00,344 --> 00:24:02,711
...of Defense Against
the Dark Arts teacher.

267
00:24:02,872 --> 00:24:05,294
Good luck, professor.

268
00:24:09,721 --> 00:24:12,916
Of course. That's why he knew
to give you the chocolate, Harry.

269
00:24:13,081 --> 00:24:15,633
Potter. Is it true you fainted?

270
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,310
- I mean, you actually fainted?
- Shove off, Malfoy.

271
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,389
- How did he find out?
- Just forget it.

272
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,830
Our Care of Magical Creatures
teacher...

273
00:24:24,024 --> 00:24:25,813
...has decided to retire...

274
00:24:26,008 --> 00:24:29,586
...in order to spend more time
with his remaining limbs.

275
00:24:29,784 --> 00:24:32,370
Fortunately,
I'm delighted to announce...

276
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:35,254
...that his place will be taken
by none other...

277
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:39,574
...than our own Rubeus Hagrid.

278
00:24:50,391 --> 00:24:53,075
Finally, on a more disquieting note...

279
00:24:53,272 --> 00:24:55,661
...at the request
of the Ministry of Magic...

280
00:24:55,865 --> 00:25:00,817
...Hogwarts will, until further notice,
play host to the dementors of Azkaban...

281
00:25:01,465 --> 00:25:04,780
...until such a time
as Sirius Black is captured.

282
00:25:05,721 --> 00:25:09,234
The dementors will be stationed
at every entrance to the grounds.

283
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,994
Now whilst I've been assured...

284
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,672
...that their presence will not disrupt
our day-to-day activities...

285
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,117
...a word of caution.

286
00:25:16,312 --> 00:25:19,345
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish...

287
00:25:19,512 --> 00:25:22,773
...between the one they hunt
and the one who gets in their way.

288
00:25:22,936 --> 00:25:26,417
Therefore, I must warn
each and every one of you...

289
00:25:26,585 --> 00:25:30,065
...to give them no reason
to harm you.

290
00:25:30,807 --> 00:25:35,697
It is not in the nature
of a dementor to be forgiving.

291
00:25:37,753 --> 00:25:40,917
But you know,
happiness can be found...

292
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,527
...even in the darkest of times...

293
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,430
...if one only remembers
to turn on the light.

294
00:26:00,952 --> 00:26:02,861
Fortuna Major.

295
00:26:05,593 --> 00:26:08,145
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.

296
00:26:08,343 --> 00:26:11,158
- Fortuna Major.
- No, no. Wait, wait.

297
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,075
Watch this.

298
00:26:23,384 --> 00:26:28,141
- Amazing. Just with my voice.
- Fortuna Major.

299
00:26:28,343 --> 00:26:31,758
- Yes, all right. Go in.
- Thank you.

300
00:26:33,688 --> 00:26:35,575
Still doing that after three years.

301
00:26:35,735 --> 00:26:37,809
- She can't even sing.
- Exactly.

302
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,072
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.

303
00:26:42,073 --> 00:26:43,381
- Oh, God.
- That's awful.

304
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,383
Green. That's a monkey.

305
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,672
- What is that?
- You call that a monkey?

306
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:52,945
Do not give him one again.

307
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:55,633
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.

308
00:27:02,423 --> 00:27:04,114
- Ron, catch.
- I will.

309
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,121
I think we have a winner.

310
00:27:12,024 --> 00:27:14,261
- Oh, don't try one of them.
- Oh, no.

311
00:27:14,872 --> 00:27:17,262
Look at him. His face.

312
00:27:59,129 --> 00:28:01,266
Welcome, my children.

313
00:28:01,464 --> 00:28:06,352
In this room, you shall explore
the noble art of Divination.

314
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:11,604
In this room, you shall discover
if you possess the Sight.

315
00:28:12,952 --> 00:28:16,748
Hello. I am Professor Trelawney.

316
00:28:16,921 --> 00:28:21,327
Together we shall cast ourselves
into the future.

317
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:25,237
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy,
the art of reading tea leaves.

318
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,815
So please, take the cup
of the person sitting opposite you.

319
00:28:29,303 --> 00:28:30,612
What do you see?

320
00:28:30,808 --> 00:28:36,210
The truth lies buried like a sentence
deep within a book, waiting to be read.

321
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,741
But first, you must broaden
your minds.

322
00:28:38,903 --> 00:28:43,245
- First, you must look beyond.
- What a load of rubbish.

323
00:28:43,416 --> 00:28:45,271
- Where did you come from?
- Me?

324
00:28:45,431 --> 00:28:47,985
- I've been here all this time.
- You, boy...

325
00:28:48,152 --> 00:28:50,356
Is your grandmother quite well?

326
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,374
I think so.

327
00:28:52,536 --> 00:28:55,219
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.

328
00:28:58,103 --> 00:28:59,412
Pity.

329
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,128
Broaden your minds.

330
00:29:05,592 --> 00:29:08,787
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?

331
00:29:08,951 --> 00:29:10,775
- I think you are.
- Sure.

332
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,105
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.

333
00:29:13,272 --> 00:29:14,898
Yeah.

334
00:29:15,704 --> 00:29:19,959
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.

335
00:29:20,377 --> 00:29:23,856
And that there could be the sun
and that's happiness.

336
00:29:24,087 --> 00:29:25,332
So...

337
00:29:25,528 --> 00:29:29,390
...you're gonna suffer,
but you're gonna be happy about it.

338
00:29:29,592 --> 00:29:30,868
Give me the cup.

339
00:29:33,335 --> 00:29:35,158
Oh, my dear boy.

340
00:29:37,143 --> 00:29:38,736
My dear...

341
00:29:40,344 --> 00:29:43,311
...you have the Grim.

342
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,778
The Grin? What's the Grin?

343
00:29:45,945 --> 00:29:48,693
Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim.

344
00:29:48,855 --> 00:29:50,960
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.

345
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,494
It's among the darkest omens
in our world.

346
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:55,633
It's an omen...

347
00:29:55,801 --> 00:29:57,556
...of death."

348
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:05,587
You don't think that Grim thing's
got anything to do with Sirius Black?

349
00:30:05,753 --> 00:30:09,494
Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me,
Divination's a woolly discipline.

350
00:30:09,688 --> 00:30:13,169
Now, Ancient Runes,
that's a fascinating subject.

351
00:30:13,337 --> 00:30:16,336
Ancient Runes? Exactly how many
classes are you taking?

352
00:30:16,504 --> 00:30:18,097
A fair few.

353
00:30:18,263 --> 00:30:20,272
Hang on. That's not possible.

354
00:30:20,439 --> 00:30:23,091
Ancient Runes is in the
same time as Divination.

355
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:25,165
You have to be in two
classes at once.

356
00:30:25,335 --> 00:30:28,597
Don't be silly. How could anyone
be in two classes at once?

357
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,818
"Broaden your minds. Use your
Inner Eye to see the future."

358
00:30:33,944 --> 00:30:37,741
That's it. Come on, now. Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.

359
00:30:37,912 --> 00:30:39,667
I got a real treat for you today.

360
00:30:39,832 --> 00:30:41,741
A great lesson. So follow me.

361
00:30:52,535 --> 00:30:55,504
Right, you lot. Less chattering.
Form a group over there.

362
00:30:55,673 --> 00:30:58,062
And open your books to page 49.

363
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,793
Exactly how do we do that?

364
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:03,701
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.

365
00:31:12,696 --> 00:31:16,340
- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
- I'm okay. Okay.

366
00:31:19,863 --> 00:31:22,930
- I think they're funny.
- Oh, yeah. Terribly funny.

367
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,527
Witty. God, this place
has gone to the dogs.

368
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:29,233
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's
got this oaf teaching classes.

369
00:31:30,137 --> 00:31:31,413
Shut up, Malfoy.

370
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:47,311
Dementor! Dementor!

371
00:31:54,967 --> 00:31:57,935
- Just ignore him.
- You're supposed to stroke it.

372
00:31:58,104 --> 00:31:59,510
Yeah.

373
00:32:09,304 --> 00:32:12,173
Isn't he beautiful?

374
00:32:12,343 --> 00:32:14,863
Say hello to Buckbeak.

375
00:32:15,447 --> 00:32:17,587
Hagrid, exactly what is that?

376
00:32:17,784 --> 00:32:19,725
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.

377
00:32:19,895 --> 00:32:23,245
First thing you wanna know
is they're very proud creatures.

378
00:32:23,479 --> 00:32:27,189
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.

379
00:32:27,351 --> 00:32:29,969
It may be the last thing you ever do.

380
00:32:30,135 --> 00:32:33,398
Now, who'd like to come
and say hello?

381
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:37,806
Well done, Harry. Well done.

382
00:32:40,504 --> 00:32:41,845
Come on now.

383
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,635
Now...

384
00:32:43,831 --> 00:32:47,377
...you have to let him make the first
move. It's only polite. So...

385
00:32:47,543 --> 00:32:49,331
...step up. Give him a nice bow.

386
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:51,861
Then you wait
and see if he bows back.

387
00:32:52,024 --> 00:32:54,063
If he does, you can go and touch him.

388
00:32:54,231 --> 00:32:57,297
If not... Well,
we'll get to that later.

389
00:32:59,863 --> 00:33:01,805
Just make your bow.

390
00:33:03,351 --> 00:33:04,944
Nice and low.

391
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,664
Back off, Harry. Back off.

392
00:33:13,464 --> 00:33:14,893
Keep still.

393
00:33:16,504 --> 00:33:18,412
Keep still.

394
00:33:26,264 --> 00:33:30,518
Well done, Harry. Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.

395
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:35,341
Right. I think you can go
and pat him now.

396
00:33:35,544 --> 00:33:37,299
Go on. Don't be shy.

397
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:47,734
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow. Slow.

398
00:33:50,968 --> 00:33:52,308
Not so fast, Harry.

399
00:33:57,208 --> 00:34:00,306
Slow down, Harry. That's it...

400
00:34:00,503 --> 00:34:03,536
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.

401
00:34:05,368 --> 00:34:07,572
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...

402
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:09,490
That's it...

403
00:34:10,104 --> 00:34:11,379
Yes!

404
00:34:11,959 --> 00:34:15,221
Well done! Well done, Harry,
well done!

405
00:34:15,383 --> 00:34:17,293
Does he get to fly?

406
00:34:17,495 --> 00:34:19,797
- I think he may let you ride him now.
- What?

407
00:34:19,992 --> 00:34:21,454
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!

408
00:34:21,624 --> 00:34:24,657
Put you over here,
just behind the wing joint.

409
00:34:25,303 --> 00:34:29,494
Don't pull out any of his feathers,
because he won't thank you for that.

410
00:36:06,328 --> 00:36:09,677
Well done, Harry, and well done,
Buckbeak.

411
00:36:09,879 --> 00:36:11,701
That was wicked, Harry!

412
00:36:11,895 --> 00:36:13,238
Oh, please.

413
00:36:14,008 --> 00:36:16,211
Well done, well done.

414
00:36:16,887 --> 00:36:19,954
- How am I doing me first day?
- Brilliant, professor.

415
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:27,250
You're not dangerous at all, are you,
you great ugly brute!

416
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:28,789
Malfoy, no...

417
00:36:29,655 --> 00:36:31,063
No!

418
00:36:31,768 --> 00:36:33,295
Buckbeak!

419
00:36:33,496 --> 00:36:35,535
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

420
00:36:36,664 --> 00:36:38,387
Whoa! Buckbeak!

421
00:36:39,479 --> 00:36:41,715
Away, you silly creature...

422
00:36:41,912 --> 00:36:44,847
- It's killed me!
- Calm down. It's just a scratch!

423
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:46,224
Hagrid!

424
00:36:46,392 --> 00:36:51,378
- He has to be taken to the hospital.
- I'm the teacher. I'll do it.

425
00:36:54,327 --> 00:36:57,076
- You're gonna regret this.
- Class dismissed!

426
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,410
You and your bloody chicken!

427
00:37:21,943 --> 00:37:23,885
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?

428
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:27,796
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.

429
00:37:27,959 --> 00:37:31,157
Madam Pomfrey said another minute
and I could've lost my arm.

430
00:37:31,479 --> 00:37:34,229
- I can't do homework for weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.

431
00:37:34,456 --> 00:37:38,547
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- At least Hagrid didn't get fired.

432
00:37:38,743 --> 00:37:42,322
I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.

433
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:44,275
- He's been sighted!
- Who?

434
00:37:44,472 --> 00:37:46,097
Sirius Black!

435
00:37:47,128 --> 00:37:49,996
Dufftown? That's not far from here.

436
00:37:50,392 --> 00:37:52,911
You don't think he'd come
to Hogwarts, do you?

437
00:37:53,078 --> 00:37:55,467
- With dementors at every entrance?
- Dementors?

438
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,835
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?

439
00:37:59,032 --> 00:38:03,374
That's right. Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.

440
00:38:04,151 --> 00:38:07,185
Like trying to catch smoke
with your bare hands.

441
00:38:32,247 --> 00:38:34,222
Intriguing, isn't it?

442
00:38:37,335 --> 00:38:39,986
Would anyone like to venture
a guess...

443
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:41,874
...as to what is inside?

444
00:38:42,071 --> 00:38:45,901
- That's a boggart, that is.
- Very good, Mr. Thomas.

445
00:38:46,647 --> 00:38:49,430
Now, can anybody tell me
what a boggart looks like?

446
00:38:49,622 --> 00:38:51,564
- No one knows.
- When did she get here?

447
00:38:51,798 --> 00:38:53,228
Boggarts are shape-shifters.

448
00:38:53,432 --> 00:38:56,497
They take the shape of whatever
a person fears the most.

449
00:38:56,727 --> 00:39:00,951
- That's what makes them so...
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...

450
00:39:01,142 --> 00:39:06,380
Luckily, a very simple charm exists
to repel a boggart.

451
00:39:07,703 --> 00:39:11,315
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.

452
00:39:11,607 --> 00:39:13,996
After me. Riddikulus!

453
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,206
- Riddikulus!
- Very good.

454
00:39:16,439 --> 00:39:18,829
A little louder and very clear.

455
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:21,136
- Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!

456
00:39:21,336 --> 00:39:23,342
- This class is ridiculous.
- Very good.

457
00:39:23,543 --> 00:39:27,373
So much for the easy part. You see,
the incantation alone is not enough.

458
00:39:27,575 --> 00:39:31,153
What really finishes a boggart
is laughter.

459
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:35,573
You need to force it to assume
a shape you find truly amusing.

460
00:39:35,735 --> 00:39:39,697
Let me explain. Neville,
would you join me, please?

461
00:39:39,927 --> 00:39:42,132
Come on, don't be shy. Come on.

462
00:39:43,096 --> 00:39:44,720
Come on.

463
00:39:45,142 --> 00:39:48,492
Hello. Neville, what frightens you
most of all?

464
00:39:48,695 --> 00:39:50,288
Professor Snape.

465
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:52,276
- Sorry?
- Professor Snape.

466
00:39:52,439 --> 00:39:55,700
Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all.

467
00:39:55,863 --> 00:40:00,173
- You live with your grandmother.
- I don't want it to turn into her, either.

468
00:40:00,663 --> 00:40:02,190
No...

469
00:40:02,999 --> 00:40:05,649
...it won't. I want you
to picture her clothes.

470
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:08,976
Only her clothes, very clearly,
in your mind.

471
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:12,142
- She carries a red handbag...
- We don't need to hear.

472
00:40:12,312 --> 00:40:16,021
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe...

473
00:40:16,216 --> 00:40:19,379
...here's what I want
you to do. Excuse me.

474
00:40:19,831 --> 00:40:22,645
Imagine Professor Snape
in your grandmother's clothes.

475
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:24,465
Can you do that?

476
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:27,633
Yes. Wand at the ready.

477
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:31,307
One, two, three.

478
00:40:40,695 --> 00:40:42,518
Think, Neville, think.

479
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:47,117
Riddikulus!

480
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,032
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible! Okay...

481
00:40:54,231 --> 00:40:57,014
...to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line...

482
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,276
Form a line!

483
00:41:04,438 --> 00:41:07,701
I want everyone to picture the thing
they fear the very most...

484
00:41:07,896 --> 00:41:10,863
...and turn it into something funny.

485
00:41:11,063 --> 00:41:12,688
Next! Ron!

486
00:41:15,798 --> 00:41:19,182
Concentrate. Face your fear.
Be brave!

487
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:31,660
Wand at the ready, Ron.

488
00:41:32,374 --> 00:41:34,130
Riddikulus!

489
00:41:34,295 --> 00:41:35,603
Yes!

490
00:41:36,184 --> 00:41:38,965
You see? Very good, very good!

491
00:41:39,447 --> 00:41:45,012
Marvelous! Absolutely, very, very
enjoyable! Parvati! Next!

492
00:41:46,743 --> 00:41:48,849
Show us what you see.

493
00:41:57,751 --> 00:42:01,012
Keep your nerve. Steady.

494
00:42:01,175 --> 00:42:03,063
Riddikulus!

495
00:42:04,055 --> 00:42:05,943
And next! Step up, step up!

496
00:42:06,999 --> 00:42:08,755
Wonderful, wonderful!

497
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:24,206
Here!

498
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:31,570
Riddikulus!

499
00:42:39,735 --> 00:42:42,550
Right. Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.

500
00:42:42,711 --> 00:42:44,621
Collect your books from the back.

501
00:42:44,791 --> 00:42:47,311
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you! Sorry!

502
00:42:47,479 --> 00:42:50,381
Sorry, you can have too much
of a good thing.

503
00:42:52,311 --> 00:42:56,719
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade
village are a privilege.

504
00:42:56,983 --> 00:42:59,700
Should your behavior reflect poorly
on the school...

505
00:42:59,863 --> 00:43:02,679
...that privilege shall not
be extended again.

506
00:43:03,095 --> 00:43:06,260
No permission form signed,
no visiting the village.

507
00:43:06,423 --> 00:43:07,885
That's the rule, Potter.

508
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:11,184
Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.

509
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:13,740
I thought if you signed it,
then I could...

510
00:43:13,912 --> 00:43:16,300
I can't. Only a parent
or a guardian can sign.

511
00:43:16,471 --> 00:43:19,537
Since I am neither,
it would be inappropriate.

512
00:43:21,751 --> 00:43:26,125
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.

513
00:43:27,318 --> 00:43:30,418
Forget about it, guys. See you later.

514
00:43:43,671 --> 00:43:45,614
Professor, can I ask you something?

515
00:43:45,815 --> 00:43:49,524
You want to know why I stopped you
facing that boggart, yes?

516
00:43:49,719 --> 00:43:51,061
I thought it'd be obvious.

517
00:43:51,223 --> 00:43:53,939
I assumed it would take the shape
of Lord Voldemort.

518
00:43:54,103 --> 00:43:57,452
I did think of Voldemort at first.

519
00:43:57,686 --> 00:44:00,175
But then I remembered that night
on the train...

520
00:44:00,343 --> 00:44:02,764
...and the dementor.
- I'm very impressed.

521
00:44:02,967 --> 00:44:05,716
That suggests what you fear the most
is fear itself.

522
00:44:05,878 --> 00:44:07,307
This is very wise.

523
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:09,453
Before I fainted...

524
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:11,629
...I heard something.

525
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,712
A woman...

526
00:44:14,136 --> 00:44:15,445
...screaming.

527
00:44:15,639 --> 00:44:18,738
Dementors force us to relive
our very worst memories.

528
00:44:18,936 --> 00:44:21,749
Our pain becomes their power.

529
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:24,655
I think it was my mother...

530
00:44:24,823 --> 00:44:26,962
...the night she was murdered.

531
00:44:28,503 --> 00:44:32,780
The very first time I saw you, Harry,
I recognized you immediately.

532
00:44:33,336 --> 00:44:36,084
Not by your scar, by your eyes.

533
00:44:36,471 --> 00:44:38,543
They're your mother, Lily's.

534
00:44:39,447 --> 00:44:40,822
Yes.

535
00:44:41,142 --> 00:44:44,012
Oh, yes. I knew her.

536
00:44:46,263 --> 00:44:49,939
Your mother was there for me
at a time when no one else was.

537
00:44:50,135 --> 00:44:53,233
Not only was she
a singularly gifted witch...

538
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,595
...she was also
an uncommonly kind woman.

539
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:00,013
She had a way of seeing
the beauty in others...

540
00:45:00,182 --> 00:45:06,095
...even, and most especially, when that
person could not see it in themselves.

541
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:10,096
And your father, James,
on the other hand...

542
00:45:10,263 --> 00:45:11,724
...he...

543
00:45:12,214 --> 00:45:15,444
He had a certain, shall we say,
talent for trouble.

544
00:45:17,623 --> 00:45:22,893
A talent, rumor has it,
he passed on to you.

545
00:45:26,744 --> 00:45:29,590
You're more like them
than you know, Harry.

546
00:45:30,391 --> 00:45:33,390
In time, you'll come to see
just how much.

547
00:45:36,695 --> 00:45:40,917
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant,
but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.

548
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:43,532
We never got to go
to the Shrieking Shack.

549
00:45:43,702 --> 00:45:47,597
- You heard it's the most...
- Haunted building in Britain. I know.

550
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,348
What's going on?

551
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:52,854
Probably Neville forgot
the password again.

552
00:45:53,015 --> 00:45:55,349
- Hey.
- Oh, you're there.

553
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:59,635
Let me through, please.
Excuse me! I'm Head Boy!

554
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,768
Get back, all of you.

555
00:46:02,967 --> 00:46:05,967
No one is to enter this dormitory
until it's been searched.

556
00:46:06,135 --> 00:46:07,412
The Fat Lady! She's gone!

557
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:11,798
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.

558
00:46:11,959 --> 00:46:13,781
It's not funny, Ron.

559
00:46:15,704 --> 00:46:19,632
Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours.
Back to your common room.

560
00:46:25,718 --> 00:46:26,667
- Be quiet.
- Make way.

561
00:46:26,838 --> 00:46:28,813
- The headmaster's here.
- Come on, move.

562
00:46:28,983 --> 00:46:30,806
You heard. Move!

563
00:46:44,438 --> 00:46:47,189
Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.

564
00:46:47,511 --> 00:46:51,438
Tell them to search every painting
in the castle to find the Fat Lady.

565
00:46:51,639 --> 00:46:54,572
There's no need for ghosts, professor.

566
00:46:55,383 --> 00:46:57,422
The Fat Lady's there.

567
00:46:58,231 --> 00:47:00,140
Mind where you're going! Slow down!

568
00:47:00,694 --> 00:47:03,247
You listen! I'm Head Boy!

569
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:05,749
- Come back here!
- Keep moving!

570
00:47:09,206 --> 00:47:11,956
Dear lady, who did this to you?

571
00:47:13,782 --> 00:47:18,604
Eyes like the devil, he's got,
and a soul as dark as his name.

572
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:22,380
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.

573
00:47:22,551 --> 00:47:24,917
He's here, somewhere in the castle!

574
00:47:25,142 --> 00:47:27,215
Sirius Black!

575
00:47:27,447 --> 00:47:32,336
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.

576
00:47:59,254 --> 00:48:03,990
I've searched the Astronomy Tower
and the Owlery. There's nothing there.

577
00:48:04,151 --> 00:48:06,605
- Thank you.
- The third floor's clear too, sir.

578
00:48:06,807 --> 00:48:08,662
- Very good.
- I've done the dungeons.

579
00:48:08,822 --> 00:48:11,376
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else
in the castle.

580
00:48:11,607 --> 00:48:13,996
I didn't really expect him to linger.

581
00:48:15,191 --> 00:48:17,427
Remarkable feat, don't you think?

582
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:19,794
To enter Hogwarts Castle
on one's own...

583
00:48:19,958 --> 00:48:22,511
...completely undetected?
- Quite remarkable, yes.

584
00:48:22,711 --> 00:48:24,466
Any theories on how
he managed it?

585
00:48:24,662 --> 00:48:27,510
Many. Each as unlikely as the next.

586
00:48:27,735 --> 00:48:29,229
You may recall...

587
00:48:29,399 --> 00:48:32,115
...prior to the start of term
I expressed concerns...

588
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,253
...about your appointment
of Professor...

589
00:48:34,422 --> 00:48:38,351
Not a single professor inside this castle
would help Sirius Black enter it.

590
00:48:38,518 --> 00:48:40,821
I'm quite convinced the castle is safe...

591
00:48:40,983 --> 00:48:44,463
...and I'm more than willing to send
the students to their houses.

592
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,866
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?

593
00:48:47,063 --> 00:48:49,582
Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep.

594
00:48:50,423 --> 00:48:54,929
For in dreams, we enter a world
that's entirely our own.

595
00:48:55,222 --> 00:49:01,453
Let them swim in the deepest ocean
or glide over the highest cloud.

596
00:49:37,271 --> 00:49:40,466
Turn to page 394.

597
00:49:49,527 --> 00:49:52,941
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?

598
00:49:53,623 --> 00:49:56,918
That's not really your concern,
is it, Potter?

599
00:49:57,079 --> 00:50:00,787
Suffice it to say your professor
finds himself incapable of teaching...

600
00:50:00,983 --> 00:50:05,838
...at the present time.
Turn to page 394.

601
00:50:10,454 --> 00:50:12,081
"Werewolves"?

602
00:50:12,375 --> 00:50:15,026
Sir, we just learned about red caps
and hinkypunks.

603
00:50:15,254 --> 00:50:18,255
- We're not meant to start that for weeks.
- Quiet.

604
00:50:18,454 --> 00:50:21,487
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?

605
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:25,452
Now, which one of you
can tell me the difference...

606
00:50:25,655 --> 00:50:27,990
...between an Animagus
and a werewolf?

607
00:50:28,662 --> 00:50:30,517
No one?

608
00:50:30,999 --> 00:50:33,780
- How disappointing.
- Please, sir.

609
00:50:33,975 --> 00:50:37,008
An Animagus is a wizard
who elects to turn into an animal.

610
00:50:37,175 --> 00:50:38,668
A werewolf has no choice.

611
00:50:39,063 --> 00:50:40,687
With each full moon...

612
00:50:40,887 --> 00:50:44,596
...he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.

613
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:48,206
The werewolf only responds
to the call of its own kind.

614
00:50:49,334 --> 00:50:51,985
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time...

615
00:50:52,151 --> 00:50:54,387
...you've spoken out of turn,
Miss Granger.

616
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:56,461
Are you incapable
of restraining yourself...

617
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:59,827
...or do you take pride
in being an insufferable know-it-all?

618
00:51:00,118 --> 00:51:03,380
- He's got a point, you know.
- Five points from Gryffindor.

619
00:51:03,575 --> 00:51:07,983
As an antidote to your ignorance,
and on my desk, by Monday morning...

620
00:51:08,182 --> 00:51:11,729
...two rolls of parchment
on the werewolf, with emphasis...

621
00:51:11,894 --> 00:51:14,383
...on recognizing it.
- It's Quidditch tomorrow.

622
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:18,610
Then I suggest you take extra care,
Mr. Potter.

623
00:51:18,839 --> 00:51:22,700
Loss of limb will not excuse you.

624
00:51:22,903 --> 00:51:26,515
Page 394.

625
00:51:28,439 --> 00:51:29,845
The term "werewolf"...

626
00:51:30,711 --> 00:51:35,021
...is a contraction
of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer"...

627
00:51:35,735 --> 00:51:39,990
...which means "man," and "wolf."
Werewolf, man-wolf.

628
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:42,867
There are several ways
to become a werewolf.

629
00:51:43,062 --> 00:51:45,933
They include being given the power
of shape-shifting...

630
00:51:46,198 --> 00:51:48,021
...being bitten by a werewolf...

631
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:09,550
Go, Harry! Go, Harry!

632
00:54:04,438 --> 00:54:07,155
Aresto momentum!

633
00:54:09,301 --> 00:54:12,302
- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
- Peaky?

634
00:54:12,471 --> 00:54:14,675
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet.

635
00:54:14,839 --> 00:54:17,589
Let's walk you off a tower
and see what you look like.

636
00:54:17,782 --> 00:54:20,717
Probably a right sight better
than he normally does.

637
00:54:24,215 --> 00:54:27,061
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, brilliant.

638
00:54:27,255 --> 00:54:29,142
You gave us a right good scare.

639
00:54:29,398 --> 00:54:32,747
- What happened?
- Well, you fell off your broom.

640
00:54:33,015 --> 00:54:35,251
Really? I meant the match. Who won?

641
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:41,135
No one blames you, Harry.

642
00:54:41,367 --> 00:54:45,010
Dementors aren't supposed to be
on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.

643
00:54:45,239 --> 00:54:47,213
After he saved you,
he sent them off.

644
00:54:47,383 --> 00:54:50,895
There's something else
you should know too.

645
00:54:51,446 --> 00:54:57,491
When you fell, your broom sort of blew
into the Whomping Willow, and...

646
00:54:57,974 --> 00:54:59,403
Well...

647
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,834
I'm sorry to hear
about your broomstick.

648
00:55:03,126 --> 00:55:05,646
Is there no chance of fixing it?

649
00:55:05,846 --> 00:55:07,155
No.

650
00:55:07,319 --> 00:55:10,514
Professor, why do the dementors
affect me so?

651
00:55:10,903 --> 00:55:13,869
- I mean, more than everyone else?
- Listen.

652
00:55:14,039 --> 00:55:17,071
Dementors are the foulest creatures
to walk this earth.

653
00:55:17,271 --> 00:55:21,328
They feed on every good feeling,
every happy memory...

654
00:55:21,879 --> 00:55:26,253
...until a person is left with absolutely
nothing but his worst experiences.

655
00:55:26,487 --> 00:55:30,512
You are not weak, Harry.

656
00:55:30,679 --> 00:55:34,573
Dementors affect you most because
there are true horrors in your past.

657
00:55:34,775 --> 00:55:37,741
Horrors your classmates
can scarcely imagine.

658
00:55:38,199 --> 00:55:40,403
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

659
00:55:40,597 --> 00:55:44,459
- I'm scared, professor.
- I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.

660
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:47,979
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.

661
00:55:48,151 --> 00:55:50,059
You made the one
on the train go away.

662
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:51,952
There was only one that night.

663
00:55:52,215 --> 00:55:56,623
- But you made it go away.
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.

664
00:55:56,951 --> 00:56:01,707
But as the dementors seem
to have developed an interest in you...

665
00:56:01,878 --> 00:56:05,391
...perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.

666
00:56:05,557 --> 00:56:07,379
For now, I need to rest.

667
00:56:31,798 --> 00:56:35,890
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!

668
00:56:50,871 --> 00:56:52,780
- Guys, let me go.
- Clever, Harry.

669
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:55,732
- But not clever enough.
- We've got a better way.

670
00:56:55,894 --> 00:56:58,610
- I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
- We know.

671
00:56:58,773 --> 00:57:00,084
We'll get you there.

672
00:57:00,246 --> 00:57:02,701
- We'll show you a quicker way.
- lf you pipe down.

673
00:57:02,871 --> 00:57:06,318
- Bless him.
- Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't...

674
00:57:06,902 --> 00:57:09,389
- Now, Harry.
- Come and join the big boys.

675
00:57:10,742 --> 00:57:12,782
What are you doing?!

676
00:57:13,046 --> 00:57:15,730
- What's this rubbish?
- "What's this rubbish?" he says.

677
00:57:15,926 --> 00:57:19,090
- It's the secret to our success.
- It's a wrench giving it to you...

678
00:57:19,286 --> 00:57:22,069
But we've decided
your needs are greater than ours.

679
00:57:22,231 --> 00:57:23,888
George, if you will.

680
00:57:24,086 --> 00:57:27,217
I solemnly swear
that I am up to no good.

681
00:57:30,709 --> 00:57:34,158
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot
and Prongs...

682
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:37,397
...are proud to present
the Marauder's Map."

683
00:57:37,622 --> 00:57:39,793
We owe them so much.

684
00:57:43,189 --> 00:57:46,866
Hang on. This is Hogwarts.
And that...

685
00:57:47,029 --> 00:57:49,648
- No. Is that really...?
- Dumbledore.

686
00:57:49,814 --> 00:57:50,762
- In his study.
- Pacing.

687
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:52,876
Does that a lot.

688
00:57:53,078 --> 00:57:54,834
- So this map shows...?
- Everyone.

689
00:57:55,031 --> 00:57:56,940
- Where they are.
- What they're doing.

690
00:57:57,110 --> 00:57:58,191
- Every minute.
- Every day.

691
00:57:58,358 --> 00:58:01,228
- Brilliant! Where did you get it?
- From Filch's office.

692
00:58:01,398 --> 00:58:04,017
- First year.
- There are seven secret passageways...

693
00:58:04,183 --> 00:58:06,735
...out of the castle.
- We'd recommend this one.

694
00:58:06,903 --> 00:58:09,936
- The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
- Leads you to Honeyduke's.

695
00:58:10,101 --> 00:58:11,857
Hurry. Filch is heading this way.

696
00:58:12,021 --> 00:58:15,316
And don't forget. When you're done,

697
00:58:15,478 --> 00:58:19,635
"Mischief managed."
Otherwise, anyone can read it.

698
00:58:53,494 --> 00:58:55,633
Now, how much do you want?

699
00:59:02,614 --> 00:59:04,469
Delicious.

700
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:16,044
It's meant to be the most haunted
building in Britain. Did I mention that?

701
00:59:16,214 --> 00:59:17,840
Twice.

702
00:59:18,517 --> 00:59:20,755
Do you want to move a bit closer?

703
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:22,576
To the Shrieking Shack?

704
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:25,620
Actually, I'm fine here.

705
00:59:25,782 --> 00:59:27,538
Well, well. Look who's here.

706
00:59:27,926 --> 00:59:30,097
You two shopping for your new
dream home?

707
00:59:30,327 --> 00:59:34,418
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?

708
00:59:34,646 --> 00:59:37,712
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Not very friendly.

709
00:59:38,007 --> 00:59:42,894
Boys, I think it's time we teach
Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.

710
00:59:43,094 --> 00:59:46,389
- Hope you don't mean yourself.
- How dare you talk to me!

711
00:59:46,551 --> 00:59:48,459
You filthy little mudblood!

712
00:59:52,503 --> 00:59:53,963
Who is that?

713
00:59:59,958 --> 01:00:02,226
- Don't stand there! Do something!
- What?

714
01:00:21,237 --> 01:00:23,409
What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?

715
01:00:27,222 --> 01:00:28,597
Get out of the way!

716
01:00:29,047 --> 01:00:30,574
Move!

717
01:00:30,741 --> 01:00:33,612
Malfoy! Wait! Wait!

718
01:00:37,237 --> 01:00:39,092
Harry!

719
01:00:39,254 --> 01:00:43,150
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.

720
01:00:44,278 --> 01:00:47,376
Those weasels! Never told me
about any Marauder's Map.

721
01:00:47,605 --> 01:00:50,867
He won't keep it. He'll turn it over
to Professor McGonagall.

722
01:00:51,093 --> 01:00:54,891
- Aren't you?
- Sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak.

723
01:00:55,062 --> 01:00:57,452
Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.

724
01:00:57,687 --> 01:00:59,858
- Ron fancies her.
- That's not true!

725
01:01:00,021 --> 01:01:01,810
- Professor McGonagall!
- Cornelius!

726
01:01:02,005 --> 01:01:03,315
Allow me, minister.

727
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:05,265
- Oh, Hagrid...
- Sorry about that.

728
01:01:05,462 --> 01:01:08,276
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.

729
01:01:08,469 --> 01:01:12,180
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry
wasn't sending dementors...

730
01:01:12,343 --> 01:01:16,204
...into my pub every other night!
- We have...

731
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:19,697
- We have a killer on the loose.
- Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!

732
01:01:20,023 --> 01:01:22,390
And what would bring him here?

733
01:01:23,027 --> 01:01:27,021
- Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter?

734
01:01:27,186 --> 01:01:28,877
Come.

735
01:01:31,316 --> 01:01:33,225
Harry!

736
01:01:40,626 --> 01:01:44,904
- No underage wizards allowed in today!
- Shut the damn door!

737
01:01:45,107 --> 01:01:47,016
- So rude.
- Thick heads.

738
01:01:47,251 --> 01:01:48,777
- Thick heads?!
- How dare they!

739
01:01:48,979 --> 01:01:52,012
- Who are they calling thick heads?
- Young whippersnappers!

740
01:01:52,754 --> 01:01:56,497
Nobody will come to a pub where
they'll get scared out of their wits.

741
01:01:56,659 --> 01:02:00,433
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want
dementors around the place.

742
01:02:03,091 --> 01:02:04,814
Tell me what this is all about.

743
01:02:04,978 --> 01:02:09,256
Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents
realized they were marked for death...

744
01:02:09,427 --> 01:02:11,980
Remember? They hid.
Few knew where they were.

745
01:02:12,179 --> 01:02:15,856
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.

746
01:02:16,050 --> 01:02:19,149
Not only did Black lead him
to the Potters that night...

747
01:02:19,315 --> 01:02:22,544
...he also killed Peter Pettigrew!

748
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:24,843
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.

749
01:02:25,043 --> 01:02:27,181
- Always trailing after Black.
- I remember.

750
01:02:27,347 --> 01:02:29,104
Never let James and Sirius
out of his sight.

751
01:02:29,267 --> 01:02:31,885
- What happened?
- Peter tried to warn the Potters...

752
01:02:32,052 --> 01:02:36,077
...and might have, had he not
run into an old friend, Sirius Black.

753
01:02:36,276 --> 01:02:39,952
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.

754
01:02:40,146 --> 01:02:42,220
He destroyed him!

755
01:02:42,835 --> 01:02:47,374
A finger. That's all that was left.
A finger. Nothing else.

756
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:50,441
Sirius Black may not have
put his hands to the Potters...

757
01:02:50,610 --> 01:02:53,709
...but he's the reason they're dead.
- He wants to finish things.

758
01:02:53,907 --> 01:02:56,624
- I don't believe it.
- That's not the worst of it.

759
01:02:56,818 --> 01:03:00,430
- What could be worse?
- This: Sirius Black was...

760
01:03:00,627 --> 01:03:02,667
...and remains to this day...

761
01:03:03,091 --> 01:03:04,651
...Harry Potter's godfather!

762
01:03:12,946 --> 01:03:15,150
Ron, look!

763
01:03:20,627 --> 01:03:23,114
- Sorry. Excuse me, excuse me.
- Merry Christmas.

764
01:03:59,986 --> 01:04:01,742
Harry, what happened?

765
01:04:04,147 --> 01:04:06,187
He was their friend...

766
01:04:06,675 --> 01:04:08,813
...and he betrayed them.

767
01:04:09,587 --> 01:04:11,474
He was their friend!

768
01:04:13,618 --> 01:04:15,506
I hope he finds me.

769
01:04:16,115 --> 01:04:18,351
Because when he does,
I'm gonna be ready!

770
01:04:18,804 --> 01:04:21,291
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!

771
01:04:34,994 --> 01:04:36,555
Harry.

772
01:04:37,043 --> 01:04:38,604
There you are. You came.

773
01:04:38,994 --> 01:04:42,704
Are you sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic...

774
01:04:42,867 --> 01:04:45,233
...well beyond the Ordinary
Wizarding Level.

775
01:04:45,394 --> 01:04:46,857
I'm sure.

776
01:04:47,411 --> 01:04:49,778
Well, everything's prepared.

777
01:04:50,035 --> 01:04:53,265
The spell I'm going to teach you
is called the Patronus Charm.

778
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:54,866
Did you ever hear of it?

779
01:04:55,028 --> 01:04:56,621
No? Well...

780
01:04:56,787 --> 01:05:00,203
A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one...

781
01:05:00,370 --> 01:05:04,843
...it works like a shield, with the
dementor feeding on it rather than him.

782
01:05:05,010 --> 01:05:08,687
But in order for it to work,
you need to think of a memory.

783
01:05:08,851 --> 01:05:12,648
Not just any memory, a very happy
memory, a very powerful memory.

784
01:05:12,850 --> 01:05:16,496
Can you do this?
Yes. Very well.

785
01:05:17,651 --> 01:05:19,789
Close your eyes.

786
01:05:21,491 --> 01:05:23,313
Concentrate.

787
01:05:24,498 --> 01:05:26,505
Explore your past.

788
01:05:26,994 --> 01:05:28,784
Do you have a memory?

789
01:05:30,322 --> 01:05:32,427
Allow it to fill you up.

790
01:05:33,106 --> 01:05:35,115
Lose yourself within it.

791
01:05:35,412 --> 01:05:40,528
Then speak the incantation,
Expecto Patronum.

792
01:05:40,947 --> 01:05:43,663
- Expecto Patronum.
- Very good.

793
01:05:47,315 --> 01:05:50,512
Shall we? Wand at the ready.

794
01:06:07,602 --> 01:06:10,091
Expecto Patronum!

795
01:06:10,834 --> 01:06:14,064
Expecto... Expecto...

796
01:06:14,290 --> 01:06:15,949
Expect...

797
01:06:17,875 --> 01:06:21,769
Here we go. Come on.
Sit up. Deep breaths.

798
01:06:22,066 --> 01:06:25,711
It's all right. I didn't expect you
to do it the first time.

799
01:06:26,098 --> 01:06:31,019
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this. You'll feel better.

800
01:06:31,827 --> 01:06:34,577
- That's one nasty dementor.
- Oh, no, no, no.

801
01:06:34,771 --> 01:06:37,422
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.

802
01:06:37,587 --> 01:06:40,620
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.

803
01:06:40,787 --> 01:06:43,307
As a matter of interest,
what were you thinking?

804
01:06:43,474 --> 01:06:47,020
- Which memory did you choose?
- The first time I rode a broom.

805
01:06:48,179 --> 01:06:51,375
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.

806
01:06:57,971 --> 01:07:03,022
There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.

807
01:07:04,883 --> 01:07:06,890
Well, it is.

808
01:07:07,059 --> 01:07:09,547
It's the happiest I've ever felt...

809
01:07:09,715 --> 01:07:13,512
...but it's complicated.
- Is it strong?

810
01:07:17,715 --> 01:07:20,432
Then let's give it a try.
You feel ready?

811
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:23,822
Just do it.

812
01:07:33,458 --> 01:07:36,589
Expecto Patronum!

813
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:41,576
Expecto Patronum!

814
01:08:02,291 --> 01:08:03,339
Yes!

815
01:08:05,235 --> 01:08:08,496
Well done, Harry. Well done!

816
01:08:09,012 --> 01:08:12,973
- I think I've had enough for today.
- Yes. Sit down. Here.

817
01:08:13,139 --> 01:08:15,473
Eat this, it helps. It really helps.

818
01:08:15,634 --> 01:08:17,325
And just so you know, Harry...

819
01:08:17,491 --> 01:08:21,320
...I think you'd have given your father
a run for his money. And that...

820
01:08:21,491 --> 01:08:23,465
...is saying something.

821
01:08:25,554 --> 01:08:27,465
I was thinking of him.

822
01:08:27,634 --> 01:08:29,708
And Mum.

823
01:08:29,876 --> 01:08:32,013
Seeing their faces.

824
01:08:32,627 --> 01:08:35,212
They were talking to me.

825
01:08:35,379 --> 01:08:37,551
Just talking.

826
01:08:37,715 --> 01:08:39,950
That's the memory I chose.

827
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:43,858
I don't even know if it's real.

828
01:08:44,338 --> 01:08:46,410
But it's the best I have.

829
01:08:55,283 --> 01:08:57,487
- Beautiful day.
- Gorgeous.

830
01:08:57,683 --> 01:08:59,569
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!

831
01:08:59,731 --> 01:09:02,065
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?

832
01:09:02,226 --> 01:09:05,259
- Ronald has lost his rat.
- I haven't lost anything!

833
01:09:05,426 --> 01:09:07,466
- Your cat killed him!
- Rubbish.

834
01:09:07,634 --> 01:09:10,831
Harry, you've seen the way
that bloodthirsty beast of hers...

835
01:09:10,994 --> 01:09:14,737
...is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.

836
01:09:14,898 --> 01:09:17,647
Well, maybe you should
take better care of your pets!

837
01:09:17,842 --> 01:09:19,818
- Your cat killed him!
- Did not.

838
01:09:19,986 --> 01:09:21,415
- Did.
- Didn't.

839
01:09:23,379 --> 01:09:25,899
How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?

840
01:09:26,066 --> 01:09:29,230
Well, first off, the committee members
took turns...

841
01:09:29,395 --> 01:09:31,948
...talking about why we were there.

842
01:09:33,746 --> 01:09:36,299
I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak...

843
01:09:36,468 --> 01:09:39,314
...was a good hippogriff,
always cleaned his feathers.

844
01:09:39,506 --> 01:09:42,408
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.

845
01:09:42,579 --> 01:09:45,645
He said Buckbeak was a deadly
and dangerous creature...

846
01:09:45,811 --> 01:09:48,745
...who would kill you
as soon as look at you.

847
01:09:48,947 --> 01:09:50,671
And then?

848
01:09:51,346 --> 01:09:53,932
And then he asked for the worst,
did old Lucius.

849
01:09:54,099 --> 01:09:58,060
- They're not sacking you!
- No, I'm not sacked.

850
01:10:00,082 --> 01:10:02,951
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!

851
01:10:28,723 --> 01:10:34,024
Spiders! There's... There's spiders.
Spiders. They want me to tap-dance.

852
01:10:34,226 --> 01:10:36,647
- I don't wanna tap-dance!
- You tell those spiders.

853
01:10:36,851 --> 01:10:40,647
Right, yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them...

854
01:10:58,066 --> 01:11:00,140
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.

855
01:11:00,306 --> 01:11:03,306
- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- Black was vicious.

856
01:11:03,507 --> 01:11:05,874
He didn't kill Pettigrew,
he destroyed him!

857
01:11:13,618 --> 01:11:16,936
- Put that light out!
- Sorry.

858
01:11:58,419 --> 01:12:02,379
- Watch it there, boy.
- We're trying to sleep here!

859
01:12:10,258 --> 01:12:12,746
Mischief managed. Nox.

860
01:12:14,866 --> 01:12:16,143
Potter.

861
01:12:16,307 --> 01:12:19,656
What are you doing
wandering the corridors at night?

862
01:12:19,827 --> 01:12:20,840
I was sleepwalking.

863
01:12:21,010 --> 01:12:23,499
How extraordinarily like your father
you are, Potter.

864
01:12:23,698 --> 01:12:28,270
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant,
strutting about the castle.

865
01:12:28,467 --> 01:12:32,622
My dad didn't strut. And nor do I.

866
01:12:33,330 --> 01:12:36,265
Now, if you don't mind, I would
appreciate it if you could lower your wand.

867
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:41,436
Turn out your pockets.

868
01:12:43,041 --> 01:12:45,560
Turn out your pockets!

869
01:12:48,353 --> 01:12:49,913
What's this?

870
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:53,211
- Spare bit of parchment.
- Really? Open it.

871
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,968
Reveal your secrets.

872
01:13:06,688 --> 01:13:08,096
Read it.

873
01:13:10,433 --> 01:13:15,703
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot,
and Prongs...

874
01:13:15,904 --> 01:13:19,832
...offer their compliments
to Professor Snape and..."

875
01:13:20,128 --> 01:13:21,557
Go on.

876
01:13:22,688 --> 01:13:26,397
"And request he keep his large nose
out of other people's business."

877
01:13:26,592 --> 01:13:29,047
- You insolent little...
- Professor!

878
01:13:30,592 --> 01:13:33,211
Well, well. Lupin.

879
01:13:33,376 --> 01:13:37,882
Out for a little walk in the moonlight,
are we?

880
01:13:39,201 --> 01:13:41,534
Harry, are you all right?

881
01:13:41,728 --> 01:13:44,095
That remains to be seen.

882
01:13:44,895 --> 01:13:48,474
I have now just confiscated
a rather curious artifact.

883
01:13:48,639 --> 01:13:52,023
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.

884
01:13:52,192 --> 01:13:56,796
- Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
- I seriously doubt it, Severus.

885
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:00,309
It looks as though it's a parchment
designed to insult anyone...

886
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:04,189
...who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.

887
01:14:04,384 --> 01:14:08,443
Nevertheless, I shall investigate
any hidden qualities it may possess.

888
01:14:08,608 --> 01:14:11,607
It is, after all, as you say,
my area of expertise.

889
01:14:11,775 --> 01:14:14,972
Harry, would you come with me,
please? Professor, good night.

890
01:14:20,736 --> 01:14:23,354
Are you deaf? Put that light out!

891
01:14:28,256 --> 01:14:29,631
Come in.

892
01:14:31,361 --> 01:14:36,346
I haven't the faintest idea how this map
came to be in your possession...

893
01:14:36,543 --> 01:14:40,821
...but quite frankly, I am astounded
that you didn't hand it in.

894
01:14:40,992 --> 01:14:44,505
Did it never occur to you that this,
in the hands of Sirius Black...

895
01:14:44,705 --> 01:14:46,614
...is a map to you?

896
01:14:47,392 --> 01:14:49,759
- No.
- No, sir.

897
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:54,582
Your father never set much store
by the rules either.

898
01:14:54,784 --> 01:14:58,908
But he and your mother
gave their lives to save yours.

899
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:03,448
Gambling their sacrifice
by wandering the castle unprotected...

900
01:15:03,616 --> 01:15:07,871
...with a killer on the loose
seems to me a poor way to repay them!

901
01:15:08,096 --> 01:15:10,168
Now, I will not cover up for you again.

902
01:15:10,335 --> 01:15:12,670
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.

903
01:15:12,832 --> 01:15:16,345
I want you to return to your dormitory
and stay there.

904
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:21,083
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.

905
01:15:25,568 --> 01:15:29,823
Professor, just so you know,
I don't think that map always works.

906
01:15:30,655 --> 01:15:35,390
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone I know to be dead.

907
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:38,426
Oh, really? And who might that be?

908
01:15:38,592 --> 01:15:40,087
Peter Pettigrew.

909
01:15:42,593 --> 01:15:44,600
That's not possible.

910
01:15:45,759 --> 01:15:47,352
It's just what I saw.

911
01:15:50,081 --> 01:15:51,706
Good night, professor.

912
01:15:55,072 --> 01:15:59,066
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.

913
01:15:59,233 --> 01:16:04,448
The art of crystal gazing
is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.

914
01:16:04,608 --> 01:16:07,804
Only then can you see. Try again.

915
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:10,327
Now, what do we have here?

916
01:16:12,576 --> 01:16:14,681
Do you mind me trying?

917
01:16:16,992 --> 01:16:19,840
The Grim, possibly.

918
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:25,848
My dear, from the first moment
you stepped foot in my class...

919
01:16:26,017 --> 01:16:29,628
...I sensed that you did not possess
the proper spirit...

920
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:33,566
...for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.

921
01:16:33,728 --> 01:16:37,241
You may be young in years,
but your heart is as shriveled...

922
01:16:37,407 --> 01:16:41,238
...as an old maid's, your soul
as dry as the pages of the books...

923
01:16:41,408 --> 01:16:44,407
...to which you so desperately cleave.

924
01:16:59,297 --> 01:17:01,206
Have I said something?

925
01:17:05,695 --> 01:17:10,485
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
Not that she wasn't always mental...

926
01:17:10,656 --> 01:17:13,111
...but now it's in the open
for everyone to see.

927
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,353
Hang on.

928
01:17:15,551 --> 01:17:18,334
- We better take this back.
- I'm not going back.

929
01:17:18,657 --> 01:17:21,917
- Fine. See you later.
- See you.

930
01:17:58,143 --> 01:18:03,195
Harry Potter...

931
01:18:09,792 --> 01:18:13,884
- Professor Trelawney...
- He will return tonight.

932
01:18:14,048 --> 01:18:15,609
Sorry?

933
01:18:15,808 --> 01:18:20,249
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends,
whose heart rots with murder...

934
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:22,357
...shall break free.

935
01:18:22,528 --> 01:18:24,666
Innocent blood shall be spilt...

936
01:18:24,831 --> 01:18:30,582
...and servant and master
shall be reunited once more.

937
01:18:36,673 --> 01:18:39,804
I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?

938
01:18:40,575 --> 01:18:42,298
No.

939
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:44,215
Nothing.

940
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:38,517
I can't believe they're going to kill
Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.

941
01:19:38,688 --> 01:19:41,306
- It just got worse.
- What did I say? Father said...

942
01:19:41,472 --> 01:19:45,465
...I can keep the hippogriff's head.
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.

943
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:47,998
This is going to be rich.

944
01:19:48,191 --> 01:19:50,264
- Look who's here.
- Come to see the show?

945
01:19:50,464 --> 01:19:53,431
You! You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

946
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:55,290
Hermione, no!

947
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:58,011
He's not worth it.

948
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,494
Malfoy, are you okay?

949
01:20:13,696 --> 01:20:17,721
- Let's go. Quick.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?

950
01:20:17,888 --> 01:20:22,143
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.

951
01:20:40,768 --> 01:20:44,892
Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees
when the wind blows through them.

952
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:47,228
Why don't we just set him free?

953
01:20:47,392 --> 01:20:49,726
They'd know it was me,
and then Dumbledore...

954
01:20:49,888 --> 01:20:52,757
...would get into trouble.
He's coming down, Dumbledore.

955
01:20:52,927 --> 01:20:55,196
Says he wants to be with me
when they...

956
01:20:56,159 --> 01:20:58,102
When it happens.

957
01:20:58,271 --> 01:20:59,580
Great man, Dumbledore.

958
01:21:00,544 --> 01:21:02,005
A great man.

959
01:21:04,383 --> 01:21:07,231
- We'll stay with you too.
- You'll do no such thing!

960
01:21:07,393 --> 01:21:10,425
Think I want you seeing
something like that? No.

961
01:21:10,625 --> 01:21:14,104
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh. Before you do, Ron...

962
01:21:21,249 --> 01:21:23,518
Scabbers! You're alive!

963
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:27,225
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- I think you owe someone an apology.

964
01:21:27,423 --> 01:21:31,001
Right. Next time I see Crookshanks,
I'll let him know.

965
01:21:31,167 --> 01:21:32,215
I meant me!

966
01:21:32,896 --> 01:21:35,000
Blimey. What was that?

967
01:21:41,216 --> 01:21:42,557
Hagrid!

968
01:21:44,415 --> 01:21:45,692
Oh, crikey.

969
01:21:47,104 --> 01:21:49,723
No, minister. Over this way.

970
01:21:49,919 --> 01:21:53,847
It's late. It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.

971
01:21:54,015 --> 01:21:57,627
Someone sees you outside
this time of night, you'll be in trouble.

972
01:21:57,791 --> 01:22:01,240
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!

973
01:22:02,591 --> 01:22:04,925
Quick. Quick!

974
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:06,747
Hagrid.

975
01:22:06,912 --> 01:22:10,686
- It'll be fine. It'll be okay.
- Go on, go on!

976
01:22:12,447 --> 01:22:15,131
- That's ling you see over there...
- On the slope.

977
01:22:15,295 --> 01:22:17,849
- On the slope... Ah, Hagrid.
- Professor Dumbledore.

978
01:22:18,015 --> 01:22:20,601
- Good evening.
- Minister. Make your way through.

979
01:22:20,799 --> 01:22:24,476
- Have a tea, if you like.
- No, Hagrid.

980
01:22:26,496 --> 01:22:28,950
- Gentlemen.
- I'd like a cup of tea.

981
01:22:29,152 --> 01:22:32,349
Well, I think we should get down
to our business, shall we?

982
01:22:33,471 --> 01:22:36,920
Very well. It is the decision
of the Committee for the Disposal...

983
01:22:37,089 --> 01:22:40,121
...of Dangerous Creatures
that the hippogriff Buckbeak...

984
01:22:40,287 --> 01:22:45,558
...hereinafter called "the condemned,"
shall be executed this day at sundown.

985
01:22:45,728 --> 01:22:49,111
- Dear, dear...
- Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on.

986
01:22:49,312 --> 01:22:53,534
- All right. It'll be all right.
- The execution shall dispatch...

987
01:22:53,695 --> 01:22:55,355
What?

988
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:57,528
I thought I just saw...

989
01:22:57,696 --> 01:22:59,704
- Never mind.
- Let's go!

990
01:23:04,608 --> 01:23:06,845
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.

991
01:23:51,456 --> 01:23:52,862
Oh, no.

992
01:24:03,327 --> 01:24:05,433
He bit me. Scabbers.

993
01:24:06,015 --> 01:24:07,869
Ron. Ron!

994
01:24:08,799 --> 01:24:12,181
- Ron!
- Scabbers, come back.

995
01:24:13,631 --> 01:24:15,322
Wait!

996
01:24:20,991 --> 01:24:25,115
- Scabbers, you bit me!
- Harry, you do realize what tree this is?

997
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,483
That's not good. Ron, run!

998
01:24:30,496 --> 01:24:32,918
Harry, Hermione, run!

999
01:24:33,471 --> 01:24:35,032
It's the Grim!

1000
01:24:41,759 --> 01:24:44,695
- Harry!
- Ron! Ron, wait!

1001
01:24:44,895 --> 01:24:46,805
Harry!

1002
01:24:48,319 --> 01:24:50,588
- Help!
- Ron!

1003
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:55,771
- Ron. Ron.
- Ron!

1004
01:25:10,015 --> 01:25:11,925
Come on!

1005
01:25:13,759 --> 01:25:15,135
Move!

1006
01:25:19,007 --> 01:25:20,698
Duck!

1007
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:57,275
Harry!

1008
01:26:12,543 --> 01:26:15,390
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

1009
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:19,326
- Where do you suppose this goes?
- I have a hunch.

1010
01:26:19,839 --> 01:26:21,268
I just hope I'm wrong.

1011
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:43,193
We're in the Shrieking Shack,
aren't we?

1012
01:26:44,256 --> 01:26:45,782
Come on.

1013
01:26:55,743 --> 01:26:57,084
Ron.

1014
01:26:57,599 --> 01:27:00,120
- Ron. You're okay.
- The dog. Where is it?

1015
01:27:00,319 --> 01:27:03,418
It's a trap. He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.

1016
01:27:16,735 --> 01:27:19,386
If you want to kill Harry,
you have to kill us too!

1017
01:27:19,551 --> 01:27:21,275
No. Only one will die tonight.

1018
01:27:21,471 --> 01:27:23,327
Then it'll be you!

1019
01:27:29,279 --> 01:27:31,353
Are you going to kill me, Harry?

1020
01:27:32,511 --> 01:27:34,267
Expelliarmus!

1021
01:27:37,855 --> 01:27:41,850
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?

1022
01:27:42,047 --> 01:27:44,950
Finally, the flesh
reflects the madness within.

1023
01:27:45,535 --> 01:27:49,016
Well, you'd know all about
the madness within, wouldn't you?

1024
01:27:59,007 --> 01:27:59,955
- I found him.
- I know.

1025
01:28:00,127 --> 01:28:01,403
- He's here.
- I understand.

1026
01:28:01,567 --> 01:28:04,634
- Let's kill him!
- No! I trusted you!

1027
01:28:05,055 --> 01:28:08,634
And all this time,
you've been his friend.

1028
01:28:09,312 --> 01:28:12,245
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.

1029
01:28:14,944 --> 01:28:16,569
How long have you known?

1030
01:28:17,056 --> 01:28:20,121
- Since Professor Snape set the essay.
- Well, Hermione.

1031
01:28:20,319 --> 01:28:23,134
You are the brightest witch
of your age I've ever met.

1032
01:28:23,294 --> 01:28:25,597
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!

1033
01:28:25,791 --> 01:28:28,311
- Wait!
- I did my waiting!

1034
01:28:28,479 --> 01:28:30,813
Twelve years of it!

1035
01:28:31,391 --> 01:28:33,693
In Azkaban!

1036
01:28:42,784 --> 01:28:44,441
Very well. Kill him.

1037
01:28:44,992 --> 01:28:48,603
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.

1038
01:28:48,768 --> 01:28:50,261
I know why.

1039
01:28:50,495 --> 01:28:52,634
You betrayed my parents.

1040
01:28:52,799 --> 01:28:55,614
- You're the reason they're dead!
- No, it wasn't him.

1041
01:28:55,776 --> 01:28:57,597
Somebody did betray your parents...

1042
01:28:57,759 --> 01:29:01,108
...somebody who, until quite recently,
I believed to be dead!

1043
01:29:01,311 --> 01:29:04,627
- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!

1044
01:29:04,799 --> 01:29:07,799
And he's in this room! Right now!

1045
01:29:08,287 --> 01:29:11,134
Come out, come out, Peter!

1046
01:29:11,294 --> 01:29:14,165
- Come out, come out and play!
- Expelliarmus!

1047
01:29:16,992 --> 01:29:19,381
Vengeance is sweet.

1048
01:29:19,551 --> 01:29:21,722
How I hoped I'd be the one
to catch you.

1049
01:29:21,887 --> 01:29:23,164
Severus...

1050
01:29:23,327 --> 01:29:27,866
I told Dumbledore you were helping a
friend into the castle. Here's the proof.

1051
01:29:28,031 --> 01:29:29,307
Brilliant, Snape.

1052
01:29:29,472 --> 01:29:33,694
You put your keen mind to the task
and come to the wrong conclusion.

1053
01:29:33,887 --> 01:29:36,440
If you'll excuse us,
Remus and I have business...

1054
01:29:36,607 --> 01:29:41,397
...to attend to.
- Give me a reason. I beg you!

1055
01:29:41,566 --> 01:29:44,022
- Don't be a fool.
- He can't help it. It's habit.

1056
01:29:44,256 --> 01:29:45,749
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet yourself!

1057
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:48,254
You two, quarrelling
like an old married couple.

1058
01:29:48,415 --> 01:29:50,837
Run along and play with
your chemistry set!

1059
01:29:51,359 --> 01:29:53,748
I could do it, you know.

1060
01:29:54,207 --> 01:29:59,609
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.

1061
01:29:59,776 --> 01:30:02,360
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.

1062
01:30:02,528 --> 01:30:05,877
A Dementor's Kiss. One can only
imagine what that must be like.

1063
01:30:06,047 --> 01:30:11,230
It's said to be nearly unbearable
to witness, but I'll do my best.

1064
01:30:11,455 --> 01:30:13,594
Severus, please.

1065
01:30:14,591 --> 01:30:16,500
After you.

1066
01:30:20,768 --> 01:30:22,425
Expelliarmus!

1067
01:30:24,127 --> 01:30:27,542
- Harry! What did you just do?
- You attacked a teacher!

1068
01:30:27,775 --> 01:30:30,230
- Tell me about Peter.
- He was at school with us.

1069
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:31,993
We thought he was our friend!

1070
01:30:32,159 --> 01:30:35,029
- No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!
- No, he didn't.

1071
01:30:35,199 --> 01:30:38,266
I thought so too, until you mentioned
Pettigrew on the map!

1072
01:30:38,495 --> 01:30:41,146
- The map was lying, then.
- The map never lies!

1073
01:30:41,343 --> 01:30:45,173
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!

1074
01:30:45,599 --> 01:30:50,006
- Me?! He's mental!
- Not you! Your rat!

1075
01:30:50,271 --> 01:30:53,272
- Scabbers has been in my family for...
- Twelve years?

1076
01:30:53,439 --> 01:30:55,828
Curiously long life
for a common garden rat!

1077
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,486
- He's missing a toe, isn't he?
- So what?

1078
01:30:58,655 --> 01:31:01,502
- All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
- Finger!

1079
01:31:01,694 --> 01:31:04,793
Dirty coward cut it off
so everyone would think he was dead!

1080
01:31:04,959 --> 01:31:07,861
- And then he transformed into a rat!
- Show me.

1081
01:31:10,368 --> 01:31:13,302
- Give it to him, Ron.
- What are you trying to do to him?

1082
01:31:13,503 --> 01:31:14,518
Scabbers!

1083
01:31:14,686 --> 01:31:17,621
Leave him alone! Get off him!
What are you doing?

1084
01:31:39,199 --> 01:31:40,955
Remus?

1085
01:31:41,695 --> 01:31:43,125
Sirius.

1086
01:31:43,295 --> 01:31:45,117
My old friends!

1087
01:31:50,527 --> 01:31:54,205
Harry! Look at you.
You look so much like your father.

1088
01:31:54,367 --> 01:31:57,880
- James. We were the best of friends...
- How dare you speak to Harry!

1089
01:31:58,688 --> 01:32:01,208
How dare you talk about James
in front of him!

1090
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:06,393
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
- I didn't mean to!

1091
01:32:06,559 --> 01:32:09,277
The Dark Lord. You have no idea
the weapons he possesses!

1092
01:32:09,471 --> 01:32:11,992
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?

1093
01:32:12,352 --> 01:32:17,718
- What would you have done?
- Died, rather than betray my friends!

1094
01:32:19,807 --> 01:32:22,077
James wouldn't have wanted
me killed!

1095
01:32:22,271 --> 01:32:27,705
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!

1096
01:32:28,192 --> 01:32:32,217
Should have realized if Voldemort
didn't kill you, we would. Together!

1097
01:32:32,415 --> 01:32:34,358
No!

1098
01:32:35,808 --> 01:32:39,604
- Harry, this man...
- I know what he is.

1099
01:32:39,774 --> 01:32:41,597
But we'll take him to the castle.

1100
01:32:41,759 --> 01:32:46,614
- Bless you, boy. Bless you!
- Get off!

1101
01:32:47,710 --> 01:32:50,013
I said we'd take you to the castle.

1102
01:32:50,367 --> 01:32:52,472
After that,
the dementors can have you.

1103
01:32:56,255 --> 01:32:59,833
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.

1104
01:32:59,999 --> 01:33:03,381
A bit? A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!

1105
01:33:03,552 --> 01:33:05,046
I was going for the rat.

1106
01:33:05,216 --> 01:33:08,892
Normally, I have a very
sweet disposition as a dog.

1107
01:33:09,055 --> 01:33:14,073
More than once, James suggested
that I make the change permanent.

1108
01:33:14,238 --> 01:33:18,909
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.

1109
01:33:30,976 --> 01:33:32,405
Okay.

1110
01:33:37,214 --> 01:33:39,636
- You better go.
- No. Don't worry, okay?

1111
01:33:39,806 --> 01:33:41,148
It's fine. I'll stay.

1112
01:33:41,887 --> 01:33:43,797
You go, I'll stay.

1113
01:33:44,094 --> 01:33:47,094
- You okay?
- I'm fine. Go.

1114
01:33:48,607 --> 01:33:51,477
- That looks really painful.
- So painful.

1115
01:33:51,647 --> 01:33:54,103
They might chop it.

1116
01:33:54,558 --> 01:33:57,112
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey
will fix it in a heartbeat.

1117
01:33:57,278 --> 01:34:01,305
It's too late. It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.

1118
01:34:02,528 --> 01:34:04,284
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1119
01:34:05,087 --> 01:34:08,698
I'll never forget the first time
I walked through those doors.

1120
01:34:09,375 --> 01:34:12,408
It'll be nice to do it again
as a free man.

1121
01:34:14,462 --> 01:34:17,147
That was a noble thing
you did back there.

1122
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:19,992
He doesn't deserve it.

1123
01:34:20,159 --> 01:34:23,192
I didn't think my dad
would have wanted his best friends...

1124
01:34:23,358 --> 01:34:24,821
...to become killers.

1125
01:34:25,023 --> 01:34:28,568
Besides, dead,
the truth dies with him.

1126
01:34:28,735 --> 01:34:31,004
Alive, you're free.

1127
01:34:31,167 --> 01:34:34,135
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!

1128
01:34:34,335 --> 01:34:37,531
Ron! Haven't I been a good pet?
You won't let them give me...

1129
01:34:37,694 --> 01:34:40,083
...to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!

1130
01:34:40,255 --> 01:34:44,118
- Sweet, clever girl! Surely you won't...
- Get away from her!

1131
01:34:46,494 --> 01:34:48,316
I don't know if you know, Harry...

1132
01:34:48,478 --> 01:34:52,408
...but when you were born, James
and Lily made me your godfather.

1133
01:34:52,575 --> 01:34:54,430
I know.

1134
01:34:55,551 --> 01:34:59,445
I can understand if you choose
to stay with your aunt and uncle...

1135
01:34:59,615 --> 01:35:02,004
...but if you ever wanted
a different home...

1136
01:35:02,175 --> 01:35:04,564
What? Come and live with you?

1137
01:35:05,823 --> 01:35:08,824
It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.

1138
01:35:08,990 --> 01:35:10,681
Harry!

1139
01:35:25,310 --> 01:35:28,856
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?

1140
01:35:30,110 --> 01:35:35,228
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live! Here!

1141
01:35:36,543 --> 01:35:38,452
This flesh is only flesh!

1142
01:35:39,550 --> 01:35:41,558
Expelliarmus!

1143
01:35:51,231 --> 01:35:52,726
Harry!

1144
01:35:53,758 --> 01:35:56,607
Remus! Remus!

1145
01:36:02,559 --> 01:36:04,795
Run! Run!

1146
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:16,342
- Come on.
- Wait. Wait.

1147
01:36:16,511 --> 01:36:21,400
Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea.

1148
01:36:21,567 --> 01:36:23,705
Professor?

1149
01:36:27,646 --> 01:36:29,109
Professor Lupin?

1150
01:36:36,576 --> 01:36:39,673
Nice doggy. Nice doggy!

1151
01:36:40,095 --> 01:36:42,517
There you are, Potter!

1152
01:37:14,942 --> 01:37:15,924
Sirius!

1153
01:37:16,736 --> 01:37:19,037
Come back here, Potter!

1154
01:38:22,175 --> 01:38:23,517
Sirius!

1155
01:38:24,287 --> 01:38:27,134
No. Sirius!

1156
01:39:07,295 --> 01:39:10,044
Expecto Patronum!

1157
01:41:17,407 --> 01:41:19,676
Harry?

1158
01:41:20,574 --> 01:41:22,843
I saw my dad.

1159
01:41:23,038 --> 01:41:24,532
What?

1160
01:41:24,734 --> 01:41:26,195
He sent the dementors away.

1161
01:41:26,367 --> 01:41:27,708
I saw him across the lake.

1162
01:41:27,902 --> 01:41:29,463
Harry, they've captured Sirius.

1163
01:41:29,694 --> 01:41:32,411
Any minute the dementors
are gonna perform the Kiss.

1164
01:41:32,574 --> 01:41:34,963
- They're gonna kill him?
- No. It's worse.

1165
01:41:35,166 --> 01:41:36,922
Much worse.

1166
01:41:37,087 --> 01:41:39,356
They're going to suck out his soul.

1167
01:41:40,991 --> 01:41:42,332
Headmaster, stop them.

1168
01:41:42,494 --> 01:41:45,723
- They've got the wrong man.
- It's true. Sirius is innocent.

1169
01:41:45,886 --> 01:41:47,991
- It's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?

1170
01:41:48,159 --> 01:41:49,500
He's my rat, sir.

1171
01:41:49,886 --> 01:41:53,532
He's not really a rat. He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.

1172
01:41:53,726 --> 01:41:57,239
- But then they gave him an owl...
- The point is, we know the truth.

1173
01:41:57,438 --> 01:41:59,827
- Please believe us.
- I do, Miss Granger.

1174
01:42:00,063 --> 01:42:05,245
But the word of three 13-year-old
wizards will convince few others.

1175
01:42:08,223 --> 01:42:10,873
A child's voice,
however honest and true...

1176
01:42:11,039 --> 01:42:14,650
...is meaningless to those
who have forgotten how to listen.

1177
01:42:19,646 --> 01:42:22,069
Mysterious thing, time.

1178
01:42:23,199 --> 01:42:24,474
Powerful...

1179
01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:27,420
...and when meddled with,
dangerous.

1180
01:42:28,927 --> 01:42:32,407
Sirius Black is in the topmost
cell of the Dark Tower.

1181
01:42:33,183 --> 01:42:35,190
You know the laws, Miss Granger.

1182
01:42:35,359 --> 01:42:37,082
You must not be seen.

1183
01:42:37,246 --> 01:42:40,759
And you would do well, I feel,
to return before this last chime.

1184
01:42:40,927 --> 01:42:44,310
If not, the consequences
are too ghastly to discuss.

1185
01:42:44,830 --> 01:42:46,553
If you succeed tonight...

1186
01:42:46,718 --> 01:42:49,436
...more than one innocent life
may be spared.

1187
01:42:51,198 --> 01:42:53,336
Three turns should do it, I think.

1188
01:42:58,014 --> 01:42:59,771
Oh, and by the way.

1189
01:42:59,935 --> 01:43:05,531
When in doubt, I find retracing
my steps to be a wise place to begin.

1190
01:43:05,695 --> 01:43:07,668
Good luck.

1191
01:43:08,158 --> 01:43:10,526
What the bloody hell
was that all about?

1192
01:43:11,166 --> 01:43:13,403
Sorry, Ron, but seeing
as you can't walk...

1193
01:43:41,215 --> 01:43:42,740
What just happened?

1194
01:43:42,910 --> 01:43:45,114
- Where's Ron?
- 7:30.

1195
01:43:45,278 --> 01:43:47,067
Where were we at 7:30?

1196
01:43:47,230 --> 01:43:48,953
I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?

1197
01:43:49,119 --> 01:43:51,420
Come on. And we can't be seen.

1198
01:43:52,446 --> 01:43:54,202
Hermione!

1199
01:44:11,647 --> 01:44:14,200
Hermione! Hermione, wait.

1200
01:44:15,934 --> 01:44:19,349
Hermione, will you please tell me
what it is we're doing?

1201
01:44:19,550 --> 01:44:22,267
You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

1202
01:44:22,430 --> 01:44:23,708
That's us.

1203
01:44:23,934 --> 01:44:26,716
Hermione, no! He's not worth it.

1204
01:44:26,942 --> 01:44:28,316
This is not normal.

1205
01:44:30,526 --> 01:44:32,796
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.

1206
01:44:32,958 --> 01:44:35,063
McGonagall gave it to me first term.

1207
01:44:35,231 --> 01:44:38,459
This is how I've been getting
to my lessons all year.

1208
01:44:38,654 --> 01:44:41,720
- You mean we've gone back in time?
- Yes.

1209
01:44:41,886 --> 01:44:45,115
Dumbledore obviously wanted us
to return to this moment.

1210
01:44:47,327 --> 01:44:50,360
Clearly, something happened
he wants us to change.

1211
01:44:53,375 --> 01:44:54,651
Good punch.

1212
01:44:54,815 --> 01:44:56,244
Thanks.

1213
01:44:57,214 --> 01:44:58,807
Malfoy's coming.

1214
01:44:59,678 --> 01:45:01,915
- Run.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?

1215
01:45:02,367 --> 01:45:05,300
I'm gonna get that jumped-up
mudblood! Mark my words.

1216
01:45:05,470 --> 01:45:09,245
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.

1217
01:45:10,558 --> 01:45:13,047
Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.

1218
01:45:31,390 --> 01:45:33,845
Look. Buckbeak's still alive.

1219
01:45:35,231 --> 01:45:37,053
Of course.

1220
01:45:37,213 --> 01:45:39,123
Remember what Dumbledore said?

1221
01:45:39,294 --> 01:45:43,156
If we succeed, more than one
innocent life could be spared.

1222
01:45:43,519 --> 01:45:44,796
Let's go.

1223
01:46:05,214 --> 01:46:07,222
Here they come. I'd better hurry.

1224
01:46:07,390 --> 01:46:09,779
Fudge has to see Buckbeak
before we steal him.

1225
01:46:09,950 --> 01:46:12,317
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid
set him free.

1226
01:46:13,311 --> 01:46:15,612
Scabbers, you're alive!

1227
01:46:15,774 --> 01:46:18,424
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- That's Pettigrew.

1228
01:46:18,654 --> 01:46:21,437
- Harry, you can't.
- He betrayed my parents.

1229
01:46:21,599 --> 01:46:24,467
- You don't expect me to sit here.
- Yes, and you must!

1230
01:46:28,191 --> 01:46:30,808
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.

1231
01:46:30,973 --> 01:46:33,690
If you go bursting in,
you'll think you've gone mad.

1232
01:46:33,854 --> 01:46:36,603
Awful things happen to wizards
who meddle with time.

1233
01:46:36,766 --> 01:46:38,938
We can't be seen.

1234
01:46:42,079 --> 01:46:43,736
Fudge is coming.

1235
01:46:44,607 --> 01:46:46,613
And we aren't leaving?

1236
01:46:48,670 --> 01:46:50,197
Why aren't we leaving?

1237
01:47:00,671 --> 01:47:02,164
Are you mad?

1238
01:47:07,935 --> 01:47:09,243
That hurt.

1239
01:47:09,439 --> 01:47:10,715
Sorry.

1240
01:47:30,718 --> 01:47:33,272
We're coming out the back door. Go!

1241
01:47:49,983 --> 01:47:52,665
Is that really what my hair
looks like from the back?

1242
01:47:54,653 --> 01:47:55,930
What?

1243
01:47:56,766 --> 01:47:58,522
I thought I just saw...

1244
01:47:58,719 --> 01:48:01,271
- Never mind.
- Let's go.

1245
01:48:15,007 --> 01:48:17,210
Okay, go, Harry. Go!

1246
01:48:23,198 --> 01:48:25,085
Get away. Get off.

1247
01:48:46,366 --> 01:48:49,628
Minister, I really think
I should sign as well.

1248
01:48:50,462 --> 01:48:53,462
Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be...

1249
01:48:53,694 --> 01:48:57,306
Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly.
Come with us now. Come on.

1250
01:49:01,598 --> 01:49:04,183
Keep trying. Come on. Quickly.

1251
01:49:06,493 --> 01:49:10,139
Buckbeak. Okay?
Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?

1252
01:49:10,911 --> 01:49:14,073
- Your name only.
- It's such a very long name...

1253
01:49:14,462 --> 01:49:16,087
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?

1254
01:49:18,686 --> 01:49:21,533
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.

1255
01:49:21,727 --> 01:49:23,930
Come and get the nice dead ferret.

1256
01:49:26,462 --> 01:49:30,771
- Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky.
- Here we are, minister. Follow me.

1257
01:49:30,975 --> 01:49:32,568
- Now, look there.
- Where?

1258
01:49:32,766 --> 01:49:35,995
- Look beyond the rocks.
- What am I supposed to see?

1259
01:49:36,157 --> 01:49:39,506
Professor Dippet had that ling
planted when he was headmaster.

1260
01:49:39,678 --> 01:49:42,396
- Oh, yes. Indeed, indeed.
- And all the strawberries.

1261
01:49:43,326 --> 01:49:46,076
- Come on, Buckbeak. Come on.
- I see no strawberries.

1262
01:49:46,238 --> 01:49:47,350
- Over there.
- Where?

1263
01:49:47,519 --> 01:49:49,209
- Over there.
- This way.

1264
01:49:49,405 --> 01:49:51,958
- Let's get this over, please.
- All right.

1265
01:49:53,566 --> 01:49:55,192
But where is it?

1266
01:49:56,094 --> 01:49:58,199
I saw the beast, just now.

1267
01:49:58,814 --> 01:50:00,920
- Not a moment ago!
- How extraordinary.

1268
01:50:01,086 --> 01:50:02,362
Buckbeak.

1269
01:50:02,558 --> 01:50:06,487
Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.

1270
01:50:06,655 --> 01:50:07,931
- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.

1271
01:50:08,127 --> 01:50:12,186
I don't think the minister's suggesting
you had anything to do with this.

1272
01:50:12,414 --> 01:50:15,132
How could you?
You've been with us all the time.

1273
01:50:15,295 --> 01:50:17,082
- Right.
- Well, well...

1274
01:50:17,245 --> 01:50:18,707
We must search the grounds.

1275
01:50:18,878 --> 01:50:21,781
Well, search the skies,
if you must, minister.

1276
01:50:21,950 --> 01:50:27,165
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup
of tea or a large brandy.

1277
01:50:27,327 --> 01:50:31,155
Oh, executioner, your services
are no longer required.

1278
01:50:31,327 --> 01:50:33,116
Thank you.

1279
01:50:33,309 --> 01:50:36,474
You'll find no small glasses
in this house, professor.

1280
01:50:46,814 --> 01:50:48,243
- Come on.
- This way.

1281
01:50:54,781 --> 01:50:56,472
This way, now.

1282
01:50:58,813 --> 01:51:00,471
- Now what?
- We save Sirius.

1283
01:51:00,671 --> 01:51:03,059
- How?
- No idea.

1284
01:51:11,998 --> 01:51:14,268
- Look. It's Lupin.
- Immobulus!

1285
01:51:20,445 --> 01:51:22,355
And Snape's coming.

1286
01:51:28,318 --> 01:51:29,911
And now we wait.

1287
01:51:31,069 --> 01:51:32,793
And now we wait.

1288
01:51:59,231 --> 01:52:02,361
- At least someone's enjoying himself.
- Yeah.

1289
01:52:05,054 --> 01:52:06,744
- Hermione?
- Yeah?

1290
01:52:06,910 --> 01:52:11,067
Before, down by the lake,
when I was with Sirius...

1291
01:52:11,229 --> 01:52:13,269
...I did see someone.

1292
01:52:13,438 --> 01:52:16,734
That someone
made the dementors go away.

1293
01:52:16,893 --> 01:52:18,170
With a Patronus.

1294
01:52:18,335 --> 01:52:20,156
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.

1295
01:52:20,317 --> 01:52:21,724
According to him...

1296
01:52:21,885 --> 01:52:25,147
...only a really powerful wizard
could have conjured it.

1297
01:52:25,310 --> 01:52:27,132
It was my dad.

1298
01:52:28,190 --> 01:52:29,913
My dad conjured the Patronus.

1299
01:52:30,077 --> 01:52:32,249
- Harry, but your dad's...
- Dead. I know.

1300
01:52:33,598 --> 01:52:35,834
I'm just telling you what I saw.

1301
01:52:39,806 --> 01:52:41,367
Here we come.

1302
01:52:46,813 --> 01:52:49,083
You see Sirius talking to me there?

1303
01:52:49,247 --> 01:52:52,060
- He's asking me to come live with him.
- That's great.

1304
01:52:52,221 --> 01:52:55,321
When we free him, I'll never
have to go back to the Dursleys'.

1305
01:52:55,485 --> 01:52:57,045
It'll just be me and him.

1306
01:52:57,694 --> 01:52:59,549
We could live in the country...

1307
01:52:59,711 --> 01:53:02,230
...someplace you can see the sky.

1308
01:53:02,399 --> 01:53:05,115
He'll like that after
all those years in Azkaban.

1309
01:53:06,109 --> 01:53:07,604
Harry!

1310
01:53:09,086 --> 01:53:10,712
Run!

1311
01:53:17,343 --> 01:53:18,804
Let's go.

1312
01:53:37,567 --> 01:53:39,803
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.

1313
01:53:43,871 --> 01:53:45,211
Thanks.

1314
01:53:46,973 --> 01:53:50,835
- Great. Now he's coming for us.
- Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!

1315
01:55:02,878 --> 01:55:04,568
That was so scary.

1316
01:55:04,733 --> 01:55:07,549
Poor Professor Lupin's
having a really tough night.

1317
01:55:18,525 --> 01:55:21,525
Sirius. Come on!

1318
01:55:36,893 --> 01:55:38,902
- This is horrible.
- Don't worry.

1319
01:55:39,070 --> 01:55:42,168
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.

1320
01:55:50,525 --> 01:55:52,281
Any minute now.

1321
01:55:52,478 --> 01:55:54,420
Right there. You'll see.

1322
01:55:55,774 --> 01:55:58,162
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.

1323
01:55:58,333 --> 01:56:00,754
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.

1324
01:56:04,733 --> 01:56:07,069
- Sirius.
- You're dying...

1325
01:56:09,054 --> 01:56:10,843
...both of you.

1326
01:56:12,830 --> 01:56:14,488
Harry!

1327
01:56:16,318 --> 01:56:20,028
Expecto Patronum!

1328
01:57:16,253 --> 01:57:17,747
You were right, Hermione.

1329
01:57:17,918 --> 01:57:21,113
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!

1330
01:57:21,277 --> 01:57:23,928
I saw myself conjuring
the Patronus before.

1331
01:57:24,093 --> 01:57:26,362
I knew I could do it
this time because...

1332
01:57:26,525 --> 01:57:28,151
...well, I had already done it.

1333
01:57:28,319 --> 01:57:30,685
- Does that make sense?
- No.

1334
01:57:30,847 --> 01:57:33,563
But I don't like flying...!

1335
01:57:46,174 --> 01:57:47,449
Bombarda!

1336
01:58:19,390 --> 01:58:22,073
I'll be forever grateful for this...

1337
01:58:22,238 --> 01:58:23,513
...to both of you.

1338
01:58:23,677 --> 01:58:26,493
- I want to go with you.
- One day, perhaps.

1339
01:58:26,653 --> 01:58:29,435
For some time, my life
will be too unpredictable.

1340
01:58:29,597 --> 01:58:31,289
And besides...

1341
01:58:32,157 --> 01:58:35,322
...you're meant to be here.
- But you're innocent.

1342
01:58:35,486 --> 01:58:37,525
And you know it.

1343
01:58:38,557 --> 01:58:40,379
And for now, that will do.

1344
01:58:42,589 --> 01:58:45,046
I expect you're tired of hearing this...

1345
01:58:46,013 --> 01:58:48,435
...but you look so like your father.

1346
01:58:50,109 --> 01:58:51,997
Except your eyes.

1347
01:58:52,925 --> 01:58:55,130
- You have...
- My mother's eyes.

1348
01:58:56,989 --> 01:59:01,879
It's cruel that I spent so much time
with James and Lily, and you so little.

1349
01:59:02,461 --> 01:59:03,891
But know this:

1350
01:59:04,957 --> 01:59:07,991
The ones that love us
never really leave us.

1351
01:59:09,310 --> 01:59:11,197
And you can always find them...

1352
01:59:13,501 --> 01:59:15,290
...in here.

1353
01:59:25,246 --> 01:59:27,666
You really are the brightest
witch of your age.

1354
01:59:53,406 --> 01:59:54,966
We have to go.

1355
02:00:22,077 --> 02:00:24,630
- Well?
- He's free. We did it.

1356
02:00:24,798 --> 02:00:26,259
Did what?

1357
02:00:26,461 --> 02:00:28,316
Good night.

1358
02:00:36,733 --> 02:00:38,009
How did you get there?

1359
02:00:38,173 --> 02:00:40,727
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.

1360
02:00:41,054 --> 02:00:43,542
- What's he talking about, Harry?
- I don't know.

1361
02:00:43,741 --> 02:00:47,124
Honestly, Ron. How can somebody
be in two places at once?

1362
02:01:12,541 --> 02:01:13,970
Hello, Harry.

1363
02:01:17,438 --> 02:01:19,193
I saw you coming.

1364
02:01:23,581 --> 02:01:26,166
I've looked worse, believe me.

1365
02:01:28,765 --> 02:01:31,799
- You've been sacked.
- No.

1366
02:01:31,966 --> 02:01:34,812
No. I resigned, actually.

1367
02:01:34,973 --> 02:01:36,665
Resigned? Why?

1368
02:01:36,829 --> 02:01:41,915
Well, it seems that somebody
let slip the nature of my condition.

1369
02:01:42,078 --> 02:01:47,348
This time tomorrow, the owls will start
arriving and parents will not want...

1370
02:01:47,517 --> 02:01:50,746
...well, someone like me
teaching their children.

1371
02:01:50,973 --> 02:01:52,795
- But Dumbledore...
- He has already...

1372
02:01:52,957 --> 02:01:54,747
...risked enough on my behalf.

1373
02:01:54,910 --> 02:01:58,041
Besides, people like me are...

1374
02:01:58,653 --> 02:02:01,849
Well, let's just say
that I'm used to it by now.

1375
02:02:11,006 --> 02:02:13,461
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?

1376
02:02:13,629 --> 02:02:15,702
None of it made any difference.

1377
02:02:15,901 --> 02:02:19,285
- Pettigrew escaped.
- Didn't make any difference?

1378
02:02:19,453 --> 02:02:22,801
It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.

1379
02:02:22,974 --> 02:02:25,362
You saved an innocent man
from a terrible fate.

1380
02:02:25,725 --> 02:02:28,114
It made a great deal of difference.

1381
02:02:32,573 --> 02:02:34,679
If I am proud of anything...

1382
02:02:34,846 --> 02:02:37,398
...it is of how much
you have learned this year.

1383
02:02:37,565 --> 02:02:40,183
Now, since I am no longer
your teacher...

1384
02:02:40,382 --> 02:02:44,439
...I feel no guilt whatsoever
about giving this back to you.

1385
02:02:45,310 --> 02:02:47,698
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.

1386
02:02:47,870 --> 02:02:50,357
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.

1387
02:02:50,877 --> 02:02:52,154
Until then...

1388
02:02:53,437 --> 02:02:55,063
...mischief managed.

1389
02:03:27,934 --> 02:03:31,960
Stand back, I said! Or I'll take it
upstairs if you don't settle.

1390
02:03:32,125 --> 02:03:33,466
Harry.

1391
02:03:34,269 --> 02:03:35,611
Wherever did you get it?

1392
02:03:35,774 --> 02:03:38,075
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.

1393
02:03:38,238 --> 02:03:40,310
- What are you talking about?
- Quiet.

1394
02:03:40,478 --> 02:03:43,641
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.

1395
02:03:43,805 --> 02:03:46,194
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.

1396
02:03:46,364 --> 02:03:47,793
Did not.

1397
02:03:49,117 --> 02:03:52,467
- It's a Firebolt.
- It's the fastest broom in the world.

1398
02:03:52,638 --> 02:03:54,098
For me?

1399
02:03:54,301 --> 02:03:56,722
- But who sent it?
- No one knows.

1400
02:03:56,893 --> 02:03:58,715
This came with it.

1401
02:04:03,358 --> 02:04:04,951
- Go on, Harry!
- Yeah, let's see.

1402
02:04:05,117 --> 02:04:06,874
How fast is it, Harry?

1403
02:04:25,437 --> 02:04:26,998
Lumos.

1404
02:04:27,166 --> 02:04:29,467
I solemnly swear that I am
up to no good.

1405
02:15:20,829 --> 02:15:22,552
Mischief managed.
