1
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:31,740
<i>Earth-That-Was...</i>

2
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:34,910
<i>...could no longer sustain
our numbers, we were so many.</i>

3
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:40,624
<i>We found a new solar system.</i>

4
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,919
<i>Dozens of planets
and hundreds of moons.</i>

5
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:48,966
<i>Each one terraformed,
a process taking decades...</i>

6
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,219
<i>...to support human life.
To be new Earths.</i>

7
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:55,138
<i>The central planets
formed the Alliance.</i>

8
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,599
<i>Ruled by an interplanetary
parliament...</i>

9
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:00,143
<i>...the Alliance was
a beacon of civilization.</i>

10
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,939
<i>The savage outer planets
were not so enlightened...</i>

11
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:06,024
<i>...and refused Alliance control.</i>

12
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:09,069
<i>The war was devastating.</i>

13
00:01:09,862 --> 00:01:12,072
<i>But the Alliance's victory
over the Independents...</i>

14
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,991
<i>...ensured a safer universe.</i>

15
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,410
And now, everyone
can enjoy the comfort...

16
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,787
...and enlightenment
of true civilization.

17
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,874
Why were the Independents
even fighting us?

18
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,917
Why wouldn't they look
to be more civilized?

19
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,587
-  hear they're cannibals.
- That's only Reavers.

20
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,797
- Reavers aren't real.
- Full well they are.

21
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,674
I heard they attack settlers
from space...

22
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,176
...and kill them,
and wear their skins...

23
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,428
...and rape them
for hours and hours...

24
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:40,434
It's true that there are
dangers on the outer planets.

25
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:43,020
So with so many social
and medical advancements...

26
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,189
...we can bring
to the Independents...

27
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,107
...why would they fight
so hard against us?

28
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:48,275
We meddle.

29
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:49,818
River?

30
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,613
People don't like
to be meddled with.

31
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,823
We tell them what to do,
what to think.

32
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,491
Don't run, don't walk.

33
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:00,454
We're in their homes and in their heads
and we haven't the right.

34
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,872
We're meddlesome.

35
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,460
River, we're not telling
people what to think...

36
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,296
...we're just trying
to show them how.

37
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,675
She's dreaming. Got that?
Off the charts.

38
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,260
Scary monsters.

39
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:17,346
Let's amp it up.
Delcium, eight drop.

40
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,850
See, most of our best work
is done when they're asleep.

41
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:24,520
We can monitor and direct
their subconscious...

42
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,271
...implant suggestions.

43
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:30,192
It's a little startling to see at first,
but results are spectacular.

44
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:33,737
Especially in this case.
River Tam is our star pupil.

45
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,155
I've heard that.

46
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:37,115
She'll be ideal
for defense deployment...

47
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,992
...even with the side effects.

48
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:40,577
Tell me about them.

49
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:43,163
Well, obviously, she's unstable.

50
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:46,041
The neural stripping
does tend to fragment...

51
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,668
...their own reality matrix.

52
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,878
- t manifests as borderline...
- What use do we have...

53
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,630
...for a psychic if she's insane?

54
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,590
She's not just a psychic.

55
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:56,218
Given the right trigger,
this girl is a living weapon.

56
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:59,888
She has her lucid periods. We're hoping
to improve upon the...

57
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,600
I'm sorry, sir, but I have to ask.

58
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:06,144
Is there a reason
for this inspection?

59
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,105
Am I making you nervous?

60
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:11,650
Key members of Parliament have
personally observed this subject.

61
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,610
I was told that the Alliance's support...

62
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,153
...for the project was unanimous.

63
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:18,615
- The demonstration of her power...
- How is she physically?

64
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,409
Like nothing we've seen.

65
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:24,913
All our subjects are conditioned for combat,
but River...

66
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:28,834
...she's a creature
of extraordinary grace.

67
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,878
Yes.

68
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:34,089
She always
did love to dance.

69
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,345
River, it's Simon.

70
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:44,808
Please, it's Simon.

71
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,603
It's your brother.

72
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,403
Simon.

73
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,490
They know you've come.

74
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,165
We can't make it
to the surface from inside.

75
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,044
Find out.

76
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:45,869
A subject is loose,
security breach. Shaft 7.

77
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,179
Stop.

78
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,933
Backtrack. Stop.

79
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,530
Excuse me...

80
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:23,574
...no one is allowed
in the records room...

81
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,409
...without my express permission.

82
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,704
Forgive me, but I prefer to
see the event alone, without...

83
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:30,873
...bias.

84
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:34,251
- I need to see your clearance.
- And you are right to insist.

85
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:39,381
<i>Parliamentary override.
Full access.</i>

86
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:40,841
Apologies.

87
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,176
An operative of
the Parliament...

88
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,595
...will, of course,
have full cooperation.

89
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,638
I'm not sure what...

90
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:51,101
- I see no listing of rank or name.
- I have neither.

91
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,272
Like this facility,
I don't exist.

92
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,357
Let's talk about the Tams.

93
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,651
I assume you've
scanned the status logs...

94
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:02,821
River was your greatest
success. A prodigy.

95
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,073
A phenomenon.

96
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:08,493
Until her brother walked in
here and took her from you.

97
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:11,413
- It's not quite so simple.
- I'm well aware of that.

98
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:14,291
- There was no way that I could...
- No. No. Of course.

99
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,376
The boy spent his entire
fortune developing...

100
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,128
...the contacts
to infiltrate this place.

101
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:20,756
Gave up a brilliant future
in medicine as well.

102
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,091
- It's madness.
- Madness?

103
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,678
Have you looked at this
scan carefully, Doctor?

104
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:29,097
At his face?

105
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:34,603
It's love, in point of fact.

106
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:37,397
Something a good deal
more dangerous.

107
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:38,607
Why are you here?

108
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:43,320
Because the situation is even
less simple than you think.

109
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:47,282
Do you know what your sin is,
Doctor?

110
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,410
- I wonder if...
- It's pride.

111
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:59,211
<i>Key members of Parliament have
personally observed this subject.</i>

112
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,005
<i>I was told that
the Alliance's support...</i>

113
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:06,593
"Key members of Parliament".

114
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:10,889
Key.

115
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,142
The minds behind
every military...

116
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,770
...diplomatic,
and covert operation...

117
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:19,481
...in the galaxy,
and you put them...

118
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:22,025
...in a room with a psychic.

119
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:27,364
If there was some classified
information that she...

120
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,449
She never spoke of it.
I don't know what it is.

121
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:30,576
Nor do I.

122
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,619
And judging by her
deteriorating mental state...

123
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:33,954
...I'd say we're both
better off.

124
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,665
Secrets are not my concern.

125
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,835
Keeping them is.

126
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:44,506
Whatever secrets she might
have accidentally gleaned...

127
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,050
...it's probable she doesn't
even know she knows them.

128
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,845
That they're buried
beneath layers of psychosis.

129
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:54,850
You know, in certain
older civilized cultures...

130
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,102
...when men failed as entirely...

131
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:59,646
...as you have,
they would throw themselves...

132
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:00,981
...on their swords.

133
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,650
Well, unfortunately,
I forgot to bring a sword.

134
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:09,573
I would put that down
right now, if I were you.

135
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,701
Would you be killed in your
sleep like an ailing pet?

136
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,089
Young miss...

137
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:33,555
Young miss, I'll need all the logs
on behavioral modification triggers.

138
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,098
We'll have to reach out
to River Tam...

139
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,600
...and help her
to come back to us.

140
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:38,810
No matter how
far out Simon has...

141
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,939
This is a good death.

142
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,318
There's no shame in this...

143
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:51,573
...in a man's death.
A man who has done fine works.

144
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,868
We're making a better world.

145
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,664
All of them...

146
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:01,959
...better worlds.

147
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,509
Young miss,
I need you to go to work now.

148
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:14,429
I think I may have
a long way to travel.

149
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:28,443
Where are you hiding,
little girl?

150
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:29,046
- What was that?
- Did you see that?

151
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:33,717
Was that the primary
buffer panel?

152
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,053
- It did seem to resemble...
- Did the primary buffer panel...

153
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,097
...just fall off my gorramn ship
for no apparent reason?

154
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,059
Looks like.

155
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,685
I thought Kaylee checked
the entry couplings.

156
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:45,771
- I've a clear memory of it.
- If she doesn't get us...

157
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:48,398
...extra flow from the engine room
to offset the burn-through...

158
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,108
...this landing is gonna
get pretty interesting.

159
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:53,111
- Define "interesting".
- "Oh, God, we're all gonna die?"

160
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,824
This is the captain.
We have a little problem...

161
00:10:57,908 --> 00:10:59,993
...with our entry sequence,
so we may experience some...

162
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:02,412
...slight turbulence
and then explode.

163
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:04,039
- Can you shave the vector?
- I'm doing it!

164
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:06,750
- It's not enough.
- Just get us on the ground!

165
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:09,253
That part will happen
pretty definitely.

166
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:12,548
We're gonna explode?
I don't wanna explode.

167
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,216
Jayne, how many weapons
you plan on taking?

168
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:16,176
- You only got two arms.
- I just get excitable...

169
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,136
...as to choice.
Like to have my options open.

170
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,556
I don't plan on any shooting
taking place during this job.

171
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:24,226
What you plan and what takes place
ain't ever exactly been similar.

172
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:26,687
No grenades.

173
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:29,022
- We crashing again?
- Talk to your husband.

174
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:30,315
- Mule prepped?
- Good to go, sir.

175
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,358
Just loading her up.

176
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:32,484
Those grenades?

177
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:33,944
Yeah, Captain
doesn't want them.

178
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,572
Jayne, we're robbing the
place. We're not occupying it.

179
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,452
Kaylee!

180
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:48,917
Kaylee, what in the sphincter
of hell are you playing at?

181
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:50,961
We got the primary
buffer panel coming right...

182
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,297
Everything's shiny, Captain.
Not to fret.

183
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:56,842
You told me those entry couplings
would hold for another week!

184
00:11:56,925 --> 00:12:00,929
That was six months ago,
Captain. My ship don't crash.

185
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,432
If she crashes,
you crashed her.

186
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:07,227
Doctor.

187
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:11,023
Guess who needs to get innocked
before we hit planet-side.

188
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:13,275
Bit of a rockety ride.

189
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,819
- Nothing to be worried about.
- I'm not worried.

190
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:18,155
Fear is nothing to
be ashamed of, Doctor.

191
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,824
This isn't fear.
This is anger.

192
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:26,079
Well, kind of hard to tell one
from the other, face like yours.

193
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:29,458
Well, I imagine if it were
fear, my eyes would be wider.

194
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,293
I'll keep a lookout
for that next time.

195
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:32,628
You're not taking her.

196
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:35,589
No, no, this is not a thing I'm
interested in talking over with...

197
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,966
She's not going with you,
and that's final.

198
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:41,011
I hear the words "that's final"
come out your mouth ever again...

199
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:42,513
...they truly will be.

200
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:46,642
This boat is my home.
You all are guests on it.

201
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,310
Guests?

202
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,896
- Now, I earned my passage, Captain...
- And it's time...

203
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,773
...your little sister learned
from your example.

204
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:55,067
I have earned my passage...

205
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:58,987
...treating bullet holes,
knife wounds, laser burns.

206
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,822
Some jobs are more
interesting than others.

207
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,866
And you want to put my sister
in the middle of that.

208
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:05,077
Didn't say "want".
Said "will".

209
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,829
It's one job, Doc.
She'll be fine.

210
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,456
She's a 17-year-old girl.

211
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:12,417
- A mentally traumatized 17...
- She's a reader.

212
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,837
Sees into the truth
of things.

213
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:17,631
Might see trouble before it's
coming. Which is of use to me.

214
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:21,051
And that's your guiding star,
isn't it? What's of use.

215
00:13:21,677 --> 00:13:25,138
Honestly, Doctor, I think we may
really crash this time anyway.

216
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,516
Do you understand
what I have gone through...

217
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,059
...to keep River away
from the Alliance?

218
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:31,687
I do, and it's a fact
we here have been courteous...

219
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,313
...enough to keep
to our own selves.

220
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:36,525
- Are you threatening to...
- I look out for me and mine.

221
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:40,445
That don't include you
less I conjure it does.

222
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:43,699
You stuck a thorn in the Alliance's
paw. That tickles me a bit.

223
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,535
But it also means I got to step
twice as fast to avoid them...

224
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:49,079
...and that means
turning down plenty of jobs.

225
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:50,539
Even honest ones.

226
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:53,208
Put this crew together with
the promise of work...

227
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:55,502
...which the Alliance makes
harder every year.

228
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:57,796
Come a day there won't be
room for naughty men like us...

229
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,381
...to slip about at all.

230
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,676
This job goes south,
there well may not be another.

231
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:06,138
So here is us,
on the raggedy edge.

232
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:10,726
Don't push me,
and I won't push you.

233
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,952
Zoe, Wash gonna straighten this
boat out before we get flattened?

234
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:32,581
Like a downy feather, sir.
No one flies like my mister.

235
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:42,716
River.

236
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:47,012
I know.
We're going for a ride.

237
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,450
Hey, little one.

238
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,995
Understand your part
in all this?

239
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:15,415
Do you?

240
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:18,961
This is what I do, darling.

241
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:24,007
This is what I do.

242
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,011
Let's move, people.

243
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:31,765
Quit fiddling. Want the boat
running smooth when we get back.

244
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:34,476
- Have faith, Captain.
- Not today.

245
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,354
Pair of clips
in the rear hatch.

246
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:41,191
We should hit town
right during Sunday worship.

247
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:42,609
Won't be any crowds.

248
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:44,987
If Fanty and Mingo
are right about the payroll...

249
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:47,114
...this could look to be
a sunny day for us.

250
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:49,074
River, stay behind the others.

251
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:52,161
If there's fighting,
drop to the floor or run away.

252
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:55,205
It's okay
to leave them to die.

253
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:59,001
Doctor, I'm taking your sister
under my protection here.

254
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:01,587
If anything happens to her,
anything at all...

255
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,548
...I swear to you
I will get very choked up.

256
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,633
Honestly.
There could be tears.

257
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:19,479
Don't mind the Captain none, Simon.
I know he'll look out for her.

258
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:22,316
They'll be back
before you can spit.

259
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:27,446
Well, not that you spit.

260
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,661
What are we hoping
to find here...

261
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:36,163
...that equals
the won'th of a turd?

262
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:39,041
Security payroll. Alliance
don't have the manpower...

263
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:41,710
...to "enforce the peace"
on every outer-rim planet.

264
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:45,047
They hire out to the private
firms, who will not work for credit.

265
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:48,592
They get paid in cashy money,
which once a month rests here.

266
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:50,677
Don't that lead back to
the Alliance, anyhow?

267
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:53,597
No private firm would ever report
the theft of their own payroll.

268
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,850
They'd appear weak,
might lose their contract.

269
00:16:56,934 --> 00:17:00,562
Yeah, we're as ghosts in this.
Won't but rattle the floor.

270
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:04,775
Shiny. Let's be bad guys.

271
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,903
Hands and knees and heads
bowed down! Everybody, down!

272
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:19,706
Looks like this is the place.

273
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:23,460
You all wanna be looking very
intently at your own belly buttons.

274
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:26,797
I see a head start to rise,
violence is going to ensue.

275
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:29,925
Probably guessed we mean
to be thieving here...

276
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:32,135
...but what we're after
is not yours.

277
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:34,888
So let's have
no undue fussing.

278
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:36,932
She's locked up.

279
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:26,190
Do you know what
the definition of a hero is?

280
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:29,109
Someone who gets
other people killed.

281
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:31,153
You can look it up later.

282
00:18:34,406 --> 00:18:36,325
Big happy family.

283
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:49,213
At last. We can retire and
give up this life of crime.

284
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:01,266
You all are Browncoats, eh?
Fought for independence?

285
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,393
Petty thieving
ain't exactly soldiers' work.

286
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:07,773
War's long done. We're all
just folk now. Listen up!

287
00:19:08,524 --> 00:19:10,192
We are coming down
to empty that vault!

288
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:13,153
You have to give me
your authorization password!

289
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:18,283
Okay.

290
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:34,550
I'm telling you I heard it.
Repeater.

291
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:38,887
Did sound somewhat like gun blast.
Maybe you ought run tell Lawman.

292
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:44,351
What the hell is up?
You all right?

293
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:46,812
What's going on?

294
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:49,523
Reavers.

295
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:59,867
The leg is good. It'll bleed plenty
and we avoid any necessary organs.

296
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,285
I was thinking
more of a graze.

297
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:03,203
No, you don't want it
to look like you gave up.

298
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:04,454
No, I get that.

299
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:05,914
Mal!

300
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:08,250
Every heist, he's got
to start yelling my name.

301
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:11,211
Mal! Reavers!

302
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:14,173
The girl's pitching a fit. They're
here or they're coming soon.

303
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:15,632
Get on the Mule.

304
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:18,510
- Does that lock from the inside?
- Yes.

305
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:21,054
Get everyone upstairs. You get
them down here and you seal it.

306
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:23,724
As long as you got air you
don't open up, you understand?

307
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:26,894
Get them inside the vault!

308
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:30,105
- You see them?
- Zoe, take the wheel!

309
00:20:30,189 --> 00:20:31,565
Anybody see them?

310
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,281
Take me with you!

311
00:20:39,323 --> 00:20:40,991
Get back in the vault with
the others.

312
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:43,994
- I can't stay here! Please!
- It's too many. Move ahead.

313
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,496
Please!

314
00:21:20,072 --> 00:21:22,574
Faster! Faster!
Faster would be better!

315
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:33,210
How come they ain't
blowing us out the air?

316
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:36,171
They wanna run us down.
The up-close kill.

317
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:40,008
They want us alive
when they eat us.

318
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:44,429
Boy, sure would be nice if we had
some grenades, don't you think?

319
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:49,101
- Wash, baby, can you hear me?
- We're moments from air.

320
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:51,478
- You got somebody behind you?
- Reavers.

321
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:54,815
Kaylee!

322
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:56,692
<i>Heat her up. We got Reavers.</i>

323
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:03,824
- We're not gonna get to you in time.
- Keep moving, honey.

324
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:05,492
We're coming to you.

325
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,210
- Where's my clips?
- Rear hatch.

326
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:32,186
I won't get ate!

327
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:37,941
You shoot me if they take me!
Well, don't shoot me first!

328
00:22:56,752 --> 00:22:58,754
Get some distance on them.

329
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:01,590
You come to the flats,
I want you to swing round.

330
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:03,926
We're gonna try
a Barn Swallow.

331
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:05,928
<i>Simon! Open her up!</i>

332
00:23:11,058 --> 00:23:12,518
They're closing on us!

333
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:14,770
Those rocks,
give them a taste.

334
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:32,746
<i>Okay, baby,
we talked this through.</i>

335
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,584
Talking ain't doing.

336
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:21,378
- River?
- I swallowed a bug.

337
00:24:25,841 --> 00:24:29,303
- Are you okay?
- Is he okay?

338
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:45,027
<i>We all here?
What's going on?</i>

339
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:46,612
Hello?

340
00:24:49,114 --> 00:24:50,365
No casualties.

341
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:53,160
<i>- Anybody following?
- Nice flying, baby.</i>

342
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:55,704
That's a negative.
Clean getaway.

343
00:24:56,079 --> 00:25:00,417
Set course for Beaumonde.
First thing, I want this body...

344
00:25:00,501 --> 00:25:01,502
Simon!

345
00:25:04,505 --> 00:25:06,256
- You son of a whore.
- I'm a hair's breadth...

346
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,674
...from riddling
you with holes, Doctor.

347
00:25:07,758 --> 00:25:11,178
- One simple job! She'll be fine!
- She is fine!

348
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:13,388
Except for being still crazy,
she's a picture of health!

349
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:17,184
Wasn't for River, we'd probably be
left there. She felt them coming.

350
00:25:17,351 --> 00:25:19,436
Never again.
You understand me?

351
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,314
Seems I remember a talk about
you giving orders on my boat.

352
00:25:22,397 --> 00:25:23,941
Well, we're off your boat.

353
00:25:24,024 --> 00:25:26,485
Just as soon as River
gets her share of the bounty.

354
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:29,321
- Let's not do anything hasty...
- No, shiny!

355
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:31,198
We'll be on Beaumonde
in 10 hours' time...

356
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:34,117
...you can pick up your earnings
and be on your merry.

357
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:37,246
Meantime, you do your job.

358
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:39,706
Patch up my crew.

359
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:43,669
He didn't lie down.

360
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:47,089
They never lie down.

361
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:58,267
No, I think things will glide
a deal smoother for us...

362
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,310
...without River
and Simon on board...

363
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:01,812
...but how long
do you think they'll last?

364
00:26:01,854 --> 00:26:03,438
Doc made his call.

365
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,481
Yeah.

366
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:06,400
They's as babes in a basket
when we took them in.

367
00:26:06,483 --> 00:26:08,277
We sheltered them plenty.

368
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,697
Man has to cut loose,
learn to stand on his own.

369
00:26:13,574 --> 00:26:15,367
Like that man back in town?

370
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,788
I had to shoot him.

371
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,832
What Reavers would've done
before they killed him...

372
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:24,418
I know.
That was a piece of mercy.

373
00:26:25,252 --> 00:26:28,213
But before that, him begging
us to bring him along.

374
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:32,342
We couldn't take the weight.
Would've slowed us down.

375
00:26:32,384 --> 00:26:35,637
- You know that for certain?
- Mule won't run with five.

376
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:40,058
I should've dumped the girl?
Or you? Or Jayne?

377
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:41,518
Oh, Jayne...

378
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:45,314
You could've tossed the
payload. Tossed the...

379
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:50,277
Zoe, I got bits falling off my
ship, I got a crew ain't been paid...

380
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,322
...and, oh, yeah, a powerful need
to eat sometime this month.

381
00:26:53,739 --> 00:26:55,449
We tell Fanty and Mingo
we skunked the job...

382
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:57,493
...what do think
they'll do to us?

383
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:01,288
We're close to gone out here.

384
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:04,875
We get a job,
we got to make good.

385
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:08,086
Sir, I don't disagree
on any particular point.

386
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,006
It's just...

387
00:27:14,218 --> 00:27:17,429
...in the time of war, we would've
never left a man stranded.

388
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:20,557
Maybe that's why we lost.

389
00:27:29,942 --> 00:27:31,610
That was close.

390
00:27:33,946 --> 00:27:35,322
I do not get it.

391
00:27:36,198 --> 00:27:37,991
How's a guy get so wrong?

392
00:27:38,075 --> 00:27:41,537
Cutting on his own face,
raping and murdering.

393
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:46,458
I'll kill a man
in a fair fight...

394
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:49,795
...or if I think he's gonna
start a fair fight...

395
00:27:50,629 --> 00:27:54,174
...or if he bothers me,
or if there's a woman...

396
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:59,429
...or if I'm getting paid. Mostly
only when I'm getting paid.

397
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:03,308
These Reavers,
the last 10 years...

398
00:28:03,392 --> 00:28:06,228
...they show up like
the boogeyman from stories.

399
00:28:07,229 --> 00:28:10,524
Eating people alive?
Where does that get fun?

400
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:14,444
Shepherd Book said
they was men who just...

401
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:17,906
...reached the edge of space,
saw a vasty nothingness...

402
00:28:17,948 --> 00:28:19,950
...and went
bibbledy over it.

403
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:21,076
Oh, hell.

404
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,413
I've been to the edge.

405
00:28:25,122 --> 00:28:29,001
Just looked like more space.

406
00:28:30,002 --> 00:28:31,420
I don't know.

407
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:33,839
It can get awful lonely
in the black.

408
00:28:35,132 --> 00:28:38,594
Like to get addlepated ourselves,
we stay on this boat much longer.

409
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:41,889
Captain will drive
us all off, one by one.

410
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:44,516
Just like Simon and River.

411
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,769
Just like Inara.

412
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:51,899
<i>Kaylee, are you ever going
to put that capture down?</i>

413
00:28:51,982 --> 00:28:54,526
<i>We got to have records
of everything, Inara.</i>

414
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:58,447
<i>A bona fide companion entertained
clients on this very ship.</i>

415
00:28:58,989 --> 00:29:02,367
<i>In this very bed.
Well, I can't do my work here.</i>

416
00:29:02,451 --> 00:29:04,453
<i>And I don't think
the Captain approves.</i>

417
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:06,121
<i>The Captain
wants you to stay...</i>

418
00:29:06,205 --> 00:29:09,583
<i>That man doesn't know what he
wants. I don't have time to...</i>

419
00:29:43,742 --> 00:29:46,286
Don't talk to the barkers,
talk to the captains.

420
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:49,748
You look the captain in the eye.
Know who you're dealing with.

421
00:29:50,332 --> 00:29:51,834
I wish there was...

422
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:57,506
You shouldn't
ought to be so clean.

423
00:29:57,965 --> 00:30:01,468
It's a dead giveaway you don't
belong, you always got to be tidy.

424
00:30:01,552 --> 00:30:03,470
Don't pay anybody in advance.

425
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:07,641
And don't ride in anything
with a Capissen 38 engine...

426
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:09,685
...they fall right
out of the sky.

427
00:30:10,394 --> 00:30:11,728
Kaylee.

428
00:30:23,157 --> 00:30:25,367
River, do you want
to stay with them?

429
00:30:26,994 --> 00:30:28,537
It isn't safe.

430
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:31,290
No.

431
00:30:33,584 --> 00:30:35,711
I fear it isn't safe anymore.

432
00:30:38,213 --> 00:30:39,381
For them.

433
00:30:57,107 --> 00:30:59,359
<i>...only survivors
of the massacre apparently...</i>

434
00:30:59,443 --> 00:31:02,196
<i>locked themselves in
the train station vault.</i>

435
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:05,240
Kaylee, this is a place of business.
We can talk about Simon when...

436
00:31:05,324 --> 00:31:06,783
When he's
four worlds away?

437
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:09,203
Or the Alliance gets a hold
of him and River?

438
00:31:09,286 --> 00:31:10,329
That ain't my worry.

439
00:31:10,412 --> 00:31:12,706
I got to finish this job
and get us another one.

440
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:14,583
Can't do that
carrying those two.

441
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,919
How can you be so cold?

442
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,129
Captain didn't
make them fugitives.

443
00:31:19,254 --> 00:31:21,423
But he could
have made them family.

444
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:24,384
Instead of keeping Simon
from seeing I was there.

445
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:28,013
When I carried such a torch,
when we could've...

446
00:31:28,597 --> 00:31:31,433
We're going on a year now, I ain't
had nothing twixt my nethers...

447
00:31:31,475 --> 00:31:33,060
...weren't run on batteries.

448
00:31:33,143 --> 00:31:35,354
Oh, God! I can't know that!

449
00:31:35,604 --> 00:31:37,564
I could stand
to hear a little more.

450
00:31:38,273 --> 00:31:39,942
If you had a care
for anybody's heart...

451
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:41,610
You knew
he was gonna leave.

452
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:43,487
We never been but a way
station to those two.

453
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,197
And how do you know
what he feels?

454
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,242
He's got River to worry on but
he still could've shown you...

455
00:31:48,325 --> 00:31:50,577
If I truly wanted
someone bad enough...

456
00:31:50,661 --> 00:31:54,248
...wouldn't be a thing in the'verse
could stop me from going to her.

457
00:31:54,748 --> 00:31:56,416
Tell that to Inara.

458
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:02,881
Domestic troubles?

459
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,925
Domestic troubles?

460
00:32:05,092 --> 00:32:08,136
'Cause we don't
wanna interrupt.

461
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,389
A man should keep
his house in order.

462
00:32:10,472 --> 00:32:11,932
Fanty. Mingo.

463
00:32:12,015 --> 00:32:14,309
- He's Mingo.
- He's Fanty. You're Mingo.

464
00:32:15,561 --> 00:32:18,605
- How is it you always know?
- Fanty's prettier.

465
00:32:18,939 --> 00:32:20,732
Feel to do some business?

466
00:32:27,698 --> 00:32:28,657
Endeavors.

467
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,667
Quite a crew you've got.

468
00:32:38,834 --> 00:32:40,836
Yeah, they're
a fine bunch of reubens.

469
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:43,338
How you keep them on that
crap boat, is the subject...

470
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,174
...of much musing
between me and Fanty.

471
00:32:45,257 --> 00:32:47,593
- We go on and on.
- So I'm noticing.

472
00:32:48,594 --> 00:32:50,804
Is there a problem
we don't know of?

473
00:32:51,555 --> 00:32:53,056
You got a sweet take
kissing your foot.

474
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:56,226
How's about you take your 25%,
we can talk about the next job?

475
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,312
Well, our end is 40,
precious.

476
00:32:58,437 --> 00:33:01,356
- My muscular buttocks it's 40.
- It is...

477
00:33:01,732 --> 00:33:03,192
...as of now.

478
00:33:03,734 --> 00:33:05,360
Find anyone around
going cheaper...

479
00:33:05,444 --> 00:33:07,654
Find anyone
around going near...

480
00:33:07,738 --> 00:33:10,199
...a sorry lot like you
in the first instance.

481
00:33:10,282 --> 00:33:12,034
You're unpredictable, Mal.

482
00:33:12,117 --> 00:33:14,077
You run when you ought to fight.

483
00:33:14,161 --> 00:33:16,038
Fight when you ought to deal.

484
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:18,415
Makes a businessperson
a little twitchy.

485
00:33:54,952 --> 00:33:56,245
Miranda.

486
00:34:22,771 --> 00:34:24,356
Hey! A tussle!

487
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:25,816
Jayne.

488
00:34:44,543 --> 00:34:46,128
Do you know that girl?

489
00:34:46,503 --> 00:34:48,130
I really don't.

490
00:35:08,567 --> 00:35:10,319
Gorrammit, girl, it's me!

491
00:36:57,718 --> 00:36:58,802
May I see her?

492
00:36:58,886 --> 00:37:01,388
I believe you've got
some storytelling to do.

493
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:03,473
What in the hell happened
back there?

494
00:37:03,557 --> 00:37:06,435
Start with the part where Jayne
gets knocked out by a 90-pound girl.

495
00:37:06,476 --> 00:37:09,104
'Cause I don't think
that's ever getting old.

496
00:37:09,563 --> 00:37:12,566
- Do we know if anyone was killed?
- It's likely.

497
00:37:12,983 --> 00:37:15,486
I know she meant to kill me
before the Doc put her out.

498
00:37:15,569 --> 00:37:18,071
Which, how exactly
does that work anyhow?

499
00:37:19,615 --> 00:37:20,991
It's a safe word.

500
00:37:22,451 --> 00:37:24,620
The people who helped me
break River out...

501
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:26,997
...had intel that River and the
other subjects were being...

502
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,333
...embedded with
behavioral conditioning.

503
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,376
They taught me a safe word...

504
00:37:31,585 --> 00:37:34,463
...in case something happened.
- Not sure I get it.

505
00:37:34,796 --> 00:37:37,382
It's a phrase
that makes her fall asleep.

506
00:37:37,674 --> 00:37:40,844
- If I speak the words...
- Don't say it!

507
00:37:41,053 --> 00:37:42,971
It only works on her, Jayne.

508
00:37:45,098 --> 00:37:46,683
Well, now I know that.

509
00:37:46,808 --> 00:37:48,977
"In case something happened. "

510
00:37:49,353 --> 00:37:51,647
You feel to elaborate on
what that something might be?

511
00:37:51,688 --> 00:37:54,399
- They never said what...
- And you never did ask.

512
00:37:56,151 --> 00:37:57,110
Get your hands off...

513
00:37:57,194 --> 00:37:59,822
Eight months. Eight months,
you had her on my boat...

514
00:37:59,905 --> 00:38:01,448
...knowing full well
she could go monkeyshit...

515
00:38:01,532 --> 00:38:03,033
...at the wrong word.
You never said a thing.

516
00:38:03,116 --> 00:38:05,994
I brought her out here
so they couldn't get to her.

517
00:38:06,453 --> 00:38:08,831
- I don't even know what they...
- My ship!

518
00:38:08,914 --> 00:38:10,123
My crew!

519
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:13,293
You had a gorramn
time bomb living with us!

520
00:38:14,545 --> 00:38:17,089
Who we gonna find in there
when she wakes up?

521
00:38:18,257 --> 00:38:19,258
The girl?

522
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,343
Or the weapon?

523
00:38:22,094 --> 00:38:24,012
I thought
she was getting better.

524
00:38:24,054 --> 00:38:26,098
And I thought
they was getting off!

525
00:38:28,058 --> 00:38:31,854
Didn't we have an intricate plan how
they was gonna be not here anymore?

526
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:35,023
- We couldn't leave them now.
- No, now that...

527
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:39,528
...she's a killer woman we ought be
bringing her tea and dumplings.

528
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:43,115
In earnest, Mal,
why'd you bring her back on?

529
00:38:49,204 --> 00:38:50,455
May I see her?

530
00:39:00,174 --> 00:39:03,635
She goes woolly again, we're
gonna have to put a bullet to her.

531
00:39:04,261 --> 00:39:05,721
It's crossed my mind.

532
00:39:06,221 --> 00:39:08,849
Can I make a suggestion that
doesn't involve violence...

533
00:39:08,932 --> 00:39:10,934
...or is this the wrong crowd?
- Honey.

534
00:39:11,018 --> 00:39:13,520
We're flying a lot blinder
than usual here.

535
00:39:13,604 --> 00:39:15,439
We need to get our bearings.

536
00:39:15,939 --> 00:39:18,275
I think we need to talk
to Mr. Universe.

537
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:46,678
Oh, this is good.

538
00:39:49,139 --> 00:39:52,351
You guys always bring me
the very best violence.

539
00:39:52,893 --> 00:39:54,520
<i>You think
you're in a hot place?</i>

540
00:39:54,603 --> 00:39:58,106
<i>That's what we're looking to learn.
Is there any follow up, a newswave?</i>

541
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:01,485
There is no news. There's
the truth of the signal.

542
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:05,614
What I see. And, there's
the puppet theater...

543
00:40:05,823 --> 00:40:08,992
...the Parliament jesters foist
on the somnambulant public.

544
00:40:09,493 --> 00:40:12,454
Well, what about this? Did
this make the puppet theater?

545
00:40:12,621 --> 00:40:14,790
<i>No, sir.
And no lawforce flags, either.</i>

546
00:40:14,873 --> 00:40:16,834
<i>I had to go into
the security feed direct.</i>

547
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:19,795
- You can do that?
- Can't stop the signal, Mal.

548
00:40:20,504 --> 00:40:23,340
<i>Everything goes somewhere,
and I go everywhere.</i>

549
00:40:23,507 --> 00:40:25,467
<i>Security feeds
are a traipse to access...</i>

550
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:27,177
<i>...and I wasn't the first one in.</i>

551
00:40:27,261 --> 00:40:30,556
<i>- This has prints on it.
- So somebody else has been fed this.</i>

552
00:40:31,014 --> 00:40:34,518
<i>Zoe, you sultry minx,
stop falling in love with me.</i>

553
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:36,478
<i>You're just gonna
embarrass yourself.</i>

554
00:40:36,562 --> 00:40:38,981
<i>I have a commitment
to my Lovebot.</i>

555
00:40:41,567 --> 00:40:45,487
It was a very beautiful ceremony.
Lenore wrote her own vows...

556
00:40:45,863 --> 00:40:49,491
I cried like a baby,
a hungry, angry baby.

557
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:56,415
And she falls asleep.
Which, she would be sleepy.

558
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:57,875
Can you go back?

559
00:40:57,958 --> 00:40:59,835
See if anybody spoke with her
before she acted up.

560
00:40:59,877 --> 00:41:02,004
Made any kind
of contact with her.

561
00:41:05,007 --> 00:41:07,301
<i>- Miranda.
- "Miranda"?</i>

562
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,638
Go back further.

563
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:13,140
No.

564
00:41:15,642 --> 00:41:16,643
<i>Please.</i>

565
00:41:21,064 --> 00:41:24,193
Mal, you're very smart.

566
00:41:24,568 --> 00:41:27,863
- Someone is talking to her.
- The oaty bar?

567
00:41:30,908 --> 00:41:32,075
Subliminal.

568
00:41:33,118 --> 00:41:35,787
It's a subliminal message,
broadwaved to trigger her.

569
00:41:35,871 --> 00:41:39,208
I've been seeing this code pop
up all over, the last few weeks.

570
00:41:39,666 --> 00:41:42,169
It's Alliance
and it's high military.

571
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:47,674
<i>They have gone to enormous
trouble to find your little friend.</i>

572
00:41:48,592 --> 00:41:50,594
<i>And found her, they have.</i>

573
00:41:52,095 --> 00:41:54,598
<i>Do you all know
what it is you're carrying?</i>

574
00:42:02,439 --> 00:42:03,941
They're afraid of me.

575
00:42:05,317 --> 00:42:08,362
- I'm sorry.
- They should be.

576
00:42:09,613 --> 00:42:13,116
But I'll show them. Oh, God.

577
00:42:14,618 --> 00:42:17,746
It's okay. Hey, it's okay.

578
00:42:19,081 --> 00:42:21,250
Show me off like a dog.

579
00:42:22,459 --> 00:42:23,961
Old men covered in blood.

580
00:42:24,044 --> 00:42:26,839
It never touched them,
but they're drowning in it.

581
00:42:28,423 --> 00:42:31,677
I don't know what I'm saying.
I never know what I'm saying.

582
00:42:34,805 --> 00:42:37,099
In the Maidenead,
you said something.

583
00:42:38,141 --> 00:42:40,435
When you were triggered,
do you remember?

584
00:42:40,477 --> 00:42:43,105
The Captain saw you
say something on the feed.

585
00:42:44,857 --> 00:42:46,150
Miranda.

586
00:42:47,776 --> 00:42:48,735
Miranda.

587
00:42:50,654 --> 00:42:52,322
Ask her.

588
00:42:54,408 --> 00:42:56,160
Who is Miranda?

589
00:43:00,831 --> 00:43:03,667
Am I talking to Miranda now?

590
00:43:06,628 --> 00:43:07,588
No.

591
00:43:09,506 --> 00:43:10,591
Not right.

592
00:43:13,468 --> 00:43:17,431
But I think
when they triggered you...

593
00:43:18,265 --> 00:43:20,225
...it somehow brought this up.

594
00:43:20,767 --> 00:43:22,853
This memory.
It isn't mine.

595
00:43:23,187 --> 00:43:24,855
The memory, it isn't mine.

596
00:43:24,938 --> 00:43:27,816
And I shouldn't have
to carry it. It isn't mine.

597
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:30,486
Don't make me sleep again.
I won't.

598
00:43:31,361 --> 00:43:32,362
I won't.

599
00:43:33,155 --> 00:43:34,656
Put a bullet to me.

600
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:38,327
Bullet in the brainpan,
squish.

601
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:43,040
Don't say that. Not ever.

602
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:47,336
We'll get through this.

603
00:43:50,172 --> 00:43:52,841
Things are going to get
much, much worse.

604
00:44:46,895 --> 00:44:49,189
Thanks for taking us in again,
Shepherd.

605
00:44:49,898 --> 00:44:51,191
You got a plan?

606
00:44:51,942 --> 00:44:53,277
Hiding ain't a plan?

607
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,028
It'll do you for a spell.

608
00:44:55,112 --> 00:44:57,239
And the folks here'll be
glad of the extra coin.

609
00:44:57,281 --> 00:44:59,324
But the Alliance
will be coming.

610
00:44:59,575 --> 00:45:02,119
They're after this girl
with a powerful will.

611
00:45:02,911 --> 00:45:05,747
I look to hear the tromp
of their boots any moment.

612
00:45:08,208 --> 00:45:09,543
You won't.

613
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,590
This isn't
a palms-up military run, Mal.

614
00:45:16,091 --> 00:45:17,801
No reports broadwaved...

615
00:45:18,552 --> 00:45:19,720
...no warrants.

616
00:45:20,179 --> 00:45:22,598
Much as they want her,
they want her hid.

617
00:45:23,182 --> 00:45:25,100
That means closed file.

618
00:45:25,976 --> 00:45:27,436
Means an operative.

619
00:45:28,478 --> 00:45:30,564
Which is trouble
you've not known.

620
00:45:32,983 --> 00:45:34,860
I could have left her there.

621
00:45:37,237 --> 00:45:38,447
I had an out.

622
00:45:39,281 --> 00:45:41,408
<i>Hell, I had every reason
in the'verse...</i>

623
00:45:41,492 --> 00:45:43,619
<i>...to leave her lay
and haul anchor.</i>

624
00:45:44,661 --> 00:45:46,330
It's not your way, Mal.

625
00:45:47,831 --> 00:45:49,124
I have a way?

626
00:45:50,167 --> 00:45:51,835
That better than a plan?

627
00:45:52,377 --> 00:45:55,631
Only one thing is gonna
walk you through this, Mal.

628
00:45:57,633 --> 00:45:58,592
Belief.

629
00:46:00,552 --> 00:46:02,763
You know I always look
to you for counsel...

630
00:46:02,846 --> 00:46:05,015
...but sermons make me
sleepy, Shepherd.

631
00:46:05,724 --> 00:46:08,060
I ain't looking for help
from on high.

632
00:46:09,311 --> 00:46:11,522
That's a long wait
for a train don't come.

633
00:46:11,605 --> 00:46:15,567
When I talk about belief, why do you
always assume I'm talking about God?

634
00:46:21,532 --> 00:46:23,700
They'll come at you sideways.

635
00:46:24,493 --> 00:46:26,954
It's how they think.
It's how they move.

636
00:46:28,163 --> 00:46:31,959
Sidle up and smile.
Hit you where you're weak.

637
00:46:33,585 --> 00:46:36,505
Sort of man they're like
to send believes hard.

638
00:46:37,714 --> 00:46:39,758
Kills and never asks why.

639
00:46:44,847 --> 00:46:47,683
It's of interest to me how much
you seem to know about that world.

640
00:46:47,766 --> 00:46:49,893
I wasn't born
a Shepherd, Mal.

641
00:46:49,977 --> 00:46:52,229
Have to tell me
about that sometime.

642
00:46:54,106 --> 00:46:55,649
No, I don't.

643
00:46:59,486 --> 00:47:00,654
River?

644
00:47:01,822 --> 00:47:03,490
River, you look tired.

645
00:47:03,782 --> 00:47:07,536
I think everybody's a little tired
by now. Why don't we all lie down.

646
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:11,582
A little peace and quiet
will make everything better.

647
00:47:11,748 --> 00:47:14,293
- River. Do as you're told.
- No.

648
00:47:14,376 --> 00:47:16,962
- It's going to be fine. Lie down.
- No.

649
00:47:21,341 --> 00:47:22,593
<i>Cut them down.</i>

650
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:29,224
<i>- What?
- Mal! You up?</i>

651
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,728
<i>I got a wave. I'm gonna
bounce it down to you.</i>

652
00:47:38,192 --> 00:47:39,193
Inara.

653
00:47:40,152 --> 00:47:42,988
<i>I... Is this a bad time?</i>

654
00:47:43,906 --> 00:47:45,032
No, this...

655
00:47:45,616 --> 00:47:46,742
...good as any.

656
00:47:47,284 --> 00:47:49,995
<i>- How's your world?
- Cold. It's autumn here.</i>

657
00:47:50,496 --> 00:47:52,331
Still at the Training House?

658
00:47:56,293 --> 00:48:00,422
So, what occasions the wave?
Not that to see you ain't...

659
00:48:02,341 --> 00:48:05,385
<i>- Well, you look very fine.
- Oh. Thank you.</i>

660
00:48:05,802 --> 00:48:07,596
<i>So, what was the...</i>

661
00:48:10,057 --> 00:48:13,310
<i>I guess we're having something
of a problem here with the locals.</i>

662
00:48:13,393 --> 00:48:15,979
<i>- And, I thought maybe...
- You could use a gun hand?</i>

663
00:48:16,063 --> 00:48:20,234
<i>I'm hoping not. But if you
happen to be close at all, you...</i>

664
00:48:20,359 --> 00:48:24,363
<i>The crew could take your ease here
for a while. And there'd be payment.</i>

665
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:30,244
Well, it would be...
I mean, I'd like to.

666
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:37,084
Kaylee's been missing you
something fierce.

667
00:48:37,167 --> 00:48:38,836
<i>- Oh, man.
- I miss her, too.</i>

668
00:48:38,919 --> 00:48:41,004
<i>I even miss
my shuttle, occasionally.</i>

669
00:48:41,088 --> 00:48:43,173
Yeah, you left, um...

670
00:48:43,549 --> 00:48:45,300
Got some of your
stuff in a trunk.

671
00:48:45,342 --> 00:48:46,885
I never did get a chance
to drop it off.

672
00:48:46,969 --> 00:48:51,223
<i>- I didn't mean to leave stuff.
- I didn't look through the stuff.</i>

673
00:48:51,598 --> 00:48:54,768
I just...
Just sundries I expect.

674
00:48:57,688 --> 00:49:00,482
So I'll send you a wave,
soon as I can.

675
00:49:01,191 --> 00:49:02,359
<i>Thank you.</i>

676
00:49:11,326 --> 00:49:14,163
Inara, nice to see
her again.

677
00:49:16,165 --> 00:49:18,500
- So, trap?
- Trap.

678
00:49:19,042 --> 00:49:21,712
- We going in?
- Only but a few hours out.

679
00:49:22,337 --> 00:49:25,299
Yeah, but, remember the part
where it's a trap?

680
00:49:25,549 --> 00:49:27,968
If that's the case, then
Inara's already caught in it.

681
00:49:28,051 --> 00:49:30,012
She wouldn't
set us up willing.

682
00:49:30,262 --> 00:49:33,140
Might be we got a shot at seeing
who's turning these wheels.

683
00:49:33,223 --> 00:49:34,224
We go in.

684
00:49:34,308 --> 00:49:37,644
But how can you be sure Inara
don't just wanna see you?

685
00:49:38,562 --> 00:49:40,981
Sometimes people
have feelings.

686
00:49:41,148 --> 00:49:43,150
I'm referring here to people.

687
00:49:44,943 --> 00:49:47,029
You all were watching,
I take it.

688
00:49:48,989 --> 00:49:50,699
- Yes.
- Did you see us fight?

689
00:49:50,949 --> 00:49:52,493
- No.
- Trap.

690
00:50:00,501 --> 00:50:04,338
We're about 70 miles from the
Training House, and nobody on radar.

691
00:50:04,421 --> 00:50:06,882
If the Alliance is about,
they're laying low.

692
00:50:06,924 --> 00:50:08,091
They're about.

693
00:50:08,175 --> 00:50:10,177
Find us a home. I'll take
the shuttle a little closer.

694
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:11,929
Zoe, ship is yours.

695
00:50:12,012 --> 00:50:14,515
Remember. If anything
happens to me...

696
00:50:14,598 --> 00:50:16,350
...or if you don't hear from me
within the hour...

697
00:50:16,433 --> 00:50:18,685
...you take this ship and
you come and you rescue me.

698
00:50:18,769 --> 00:50:19,728
What?

699
00:50:20,395 --> 00:50:22,689
- Risk my ship?
- I mean it.

700
00:50:23,106 --> 00:50:25,859
It's cold out there.
And I don't wanna get left.

701
00:50:42,709 --> 00:50:46,088
Dear Buddha, please bring me a
pony, and a plastic rocket, and...

702
00:50:46,129 --> 00:50:48,048
Mal! What are you
doing here?

703
00:50:48,632 --> 00:50:49,842
Well, you invited me.

704
00:50:49,925 --> 00:50:52,469
I never thought for a second
you'd be stupid enough to come.

705
00:50:52,553 --> 00:50:54,429
Well, that makes you
kind of a tease, doesn't it?

706
00:50:54,471 --> 00:50:56,431
You knew my invitation
wasn't on the level.

707
00:50:56,473 --> 00:50:59,434
Which led me to conclude that
you must be in some trouble.

708
00:50:59,518 --> 00:51:01,270
I'm fine. I'm giddy.

709
00:51:01,353 --> 00:51:03,772
For a woman schooled in telling
a man what he wants to hear...

710
00:51:03,856 --> 00:51:07,359
...you ain't much of a liar. Mal,
you cannot handle this man.

711
00:51:13,448 --> 00:51:14,616
I have to say, Captain...

712
00:51:14,658 --> 00:51:17,536
I'm impressed that you
would come for her yourself.

713
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:20,956
And that you would make it
this far, in that outfit.

714
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:24,459
I can be very graceful
when I need to.

715
00:51:24,501 --> 00:51:25,878
I've no doubt.

716
00:51:27,296 --> 00:51:29,965
- What are you doing?
- I'm praying for you, Mal.

717
00:51:30,716 --> 00:51:32,467
She's very thoughtful.

718
00:51:32,926 --> 00:51:35,888
But I mean it when I say
I've no intent to harm you.

719
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,307
Speak your piece.

720
00:51:38,765 --> 00:51:40,642
I think you're
beginning to understand...

721
00:51:40,684 --> 00:51:42,644
...how dangerous River Tam is.

722
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:44,813
She is a mite unpredictable.

723
00:51:45,105 --> 00:51:46,982
Mood swings, of a sort.

724
00:51:47,065 --> 00:51:49,610
It's worse than you know.
It usually is.

725
00:51:49,693 --> 00:51:53,322
That girl will rain destruction
down on you and your ship.

726
00:51:54,698 --> 00:51:57,493
She is an albatross, Captain.

727
00:51:57,659 --> 00:51:59,369
Way I remember it...

728
00:51:59,495 --> 00:52:02,831
...albatross was a ship's good
luck, till some idiot killed it.

729
00:52:03,373 --> 00:52:06,043
Yes, I've read a poem.
Try not to faint.

730
00:52:06,585 --> 00:52:08,420
I've seen your war record.

731
00:52:09,379 --> 00:52:11,965
I know how you must feel about
the Alliance.

732
00:52:12,216 --> 00:52:14,426
You really don't.
Fair to say.

733
00:52:15,177 --> 00:52:18,013
But I have to hope you
understand, you can't beat us.

734
00:52:18,055 --> 00:52:19,806
I got no need to beat you.

735
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:22,726
I just want to go my way.
And you can do that...

736
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,605
...once you let me take
River Tam back home.

737
00:52:30,317 --> 00:52:32,820
No, no. You're working
this deal all crabbed.

738
00:52:32,945 --> 00:52:35,656
- You got to open with payment.
- That is a trap.

739
00:52:35,781 --> 00:52:39,326
I offer money, you'll play the
man of honor and take umbrage.

740
00:52:39,576 --> 00:52:42,204
I ask you to do what is right,
you'll play the brigand.

741
00:52:42,246 --> 00:52:44,790
I have no stomach for games.

742
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:47,292
I already know
you will not see reason.

743
00:52:47,376 --> 00:52:48,919
The Alliance wanted to
show me a reason...

744
00:52:49,002 --> 00:52:51,213
...they shouldn't have sent
an assassin.

745
00:52:57,427 --> 00:53:00,514
I have a warship
in deep orbit, Captain.

746
00:53:01,223 --> 00:53:04,726
We locked on to "Serenity's" pulse
beacon the moment you hit atmo.

747
00:53:04,893 --> 00:53:06,895
I can speak a word
and send a missile...

748
00:53:06,979 --> 00:53:09,690
...to that exact location
inside of three minutes.

749
00:53:09,773 --> 00:53:10,899
You do that...

750
00:53:12,025 --> 00:53:14,903
...you'd best make peace with
your dear and fluffy lord.

751
00:53:18,657 --> 00:53:19,908
Pulse beacon.

752
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:24,121
Advice from an old tracker. You
want to find someone, use your eyes.

753
00:53:24,663 --> 00:53:26,915
How long do you think
you can really run from us?

754
00:53:26,999 --> 00:53:29,626
I never credited the Alliance
with an overabundance of brains.

755
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:31,879
- And if you're the best they got...
- Captain Reynolds...

756
00:53:31,962 --> 00:53:34,756
I should tell you, so that
you don't waste your time...

757
00:53:34,798 --> 00:53:38,760
...you can't make me angry.
- Please, spend an hour with him.

758
00:53:39,553 --> 00:53:42,306
I want to resolve this
like civilized men.

759
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:45,267
I'm not threatening you.

760
00:53:45,642 --> 00:53:47,102
- I'm unarmed.
- Good.

761
00:53:52,232 --> 00:53:54,276
I am, of course,
wearing full body armor.

762
00:53:54,359 --> 00:53:56,695
- I am not a moron.
- Wait, just let...

763
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:26,391
What, no backup?

764
00:54:26,892 --> 00:54:30,103
- Making an awful ruckus.
- They'll come when they're needed.

765
00:54:30,187 --> 00:54:31,605
I'd start whistling.

766
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:34,900
Captain, what do you think
is going to happen here?

767
00:55:21,738 --> 00:55:26,034
Nothing here is what it seems.
He isn't the plucky hero.

768
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:30,831
The Alliance isn't some evil
empire. This is not the grand arena.

769
00:55:31,081 --> 00:55:32,708
And that's not incense.

770
00:55:39,756 --> 00:55:40,924
Sir, can you hear me?

771
00:55:41,008 --> 00:55:43,510
Just a flash bomb. Go. Go!

772
00:55:49,224 --> 00:55:52,478
- What have you done to my shuttle?
- It's not your shuttle.

773
00:55:52,853 --> 00:55:54,730
Head east. Keep her low.

774
00:56:10,579 --> 00:56:12,372
Okay, forget
the pulse beacon.

775
00:56:12,456 --> 00:56:14,583
<i>There must be another way
to track the ship.</i>

776
00:56:14,666 --> 00:56:16,084
Get a read
on the nav. Sat.

777
00:56:16,126 --> 00:56:18,712
It's a registered transport,
you must be able to locate.

778
00:56:18,795 --> 00:56:19,755
<i>Sir?</i>

779
00:56:19,838 --> 00:56:21,715
Yes, have you found
a nav. Sat. Trajectory?

780
00:56:21,798 --> 00:56:24,218
<i>Sir, we found seven.</i>

781
00:56:31,975 --> 00:56:33,685
<i>We've every reason
to be afraid.</i>

782
00:56:34,102 --> 00:56:37,064
Why,'cause this guy beat
up Mal? That ain't so hard.

783
00:56:37,147 --> 00:56:39,691
He didn't beat me up.
Nobody said that.

784
00:56:39,775 --> 00:56:41,527
Because he's a believer.

785
00:56:41,777 --> 00:56:46,198
He's intelligent, methodical,
and devout in his belief...

786
00:56:46,281 --> 00:56:48,659
...that killing River
is the right thing to do.

787
00:56:48,742 --> 00:56:51,286
So no hope
of a reward, huh?

788
00:56:52,246 --> 00:56:55,666
Did he say anything
about a Miranda?

789
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:57,543
What is that?

790
00:56:57,626 --> 00:57:00,003
Don't know who or what,
but it's on River's mind.

791
00:57:00,087 --> 00:57:02,089
Conjure it might be the reason
they're after her.

792
00:57:02,172 --> 00:57:05,050
You think maybe it poses some
kind of threat to the Alliance?

793
00:57:05,133 --> 00:57:06,468
Do we care?

794
00:57:06,885 --> 00:57:08,595
Are we caring about that?

795
00:57:08,679 --> 00:57:11,306
You dumb-ass hogs, the only
people she's a threat to is...

796
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:12,891
...us on this boat.

797
00:57:12,975 --> 00:57:14,810
Look, we get back
to Haven...

798
00:57:14,852 --> 00:57:15,894
...in a few hours' time.
- Oh, yeah.

799
00:57:15,978 --> 00:57:17,271
Hiding under
the Shepherd's skirts...

800
00:57:17,312 --> 00:57:18,355
...that's a manful scheme.

801
00:57:18,438 --> 00:57:20,440
- You wanna run this ship?
- Yes.

802
00:57:21,525 --> 00:57:23,318
Well, you can't.

803
00:57:24,069 --> 00:57:26,280
Do a damn sight
better job than you.

804
00:57:26,363 --> 00:57:28,824
Getting us lashed over
a couple of strays.

805
00:57:29,032 --> 00:57:31,034
No offense, Doc. I think
it's noble as a grape...

806
00:57:31,118 --> 00:57:32,327
...the way you look to River.

807
00:57:32,411 --> 00:57:34,872
But she ain't my sister
and she ain't your crew.

808
00:57:34,955 --> 00:57:37,332
Oh, and neither is she
exactly helpless.

809
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:40,210
So, where's it writ that we got
to lay down our lives for her?

810
00:57:40,294 --> 00:57:41,837
Which is what you've
steered us toward.

811
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,672
I didn't start this.

812
00:57:44,256 --> 00:57:45,799
No, that's right.

813
00:57:46,675 --> 00:57:50,345
Alliance starts the war,
and then you volunteer.

814
00:57:52,264 --> 00:57:53,974
Battle of Serenity, Mal.

815
00:57:54,057 --> 00:57:57,269
Besides Zoe here, how many...
Hey, I'm talking at you.

816
00:58:01,315 --> 00:58:04,318
How many men in your platoon
came out of there alive?

817
00:58:07,571 --> 00:58:09,698
You wanna leave this room.

818
00:58:12,534 --> 00:58:14,286
Damn right, I do.

819
00:58:21,627 --> 00:58:23,670
This isn't
the war, Mal.

820
00:58:24,546 --> 00:58:26,757
You telling me that
'cause you think I don't know?

821
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,967
You came to the Training House
looking for a fight.

822
00:58:29,051 --> 00:58:30,928
I came looking for you.

823
00:58:32,262 --> 00:58:34,723
I just want to know
who I'm dealing with.

824
00:58:34,806 --> 00:58:37,434
I've seen too many versions
of you to be sure.

825
00:58:37,684 --> 00:58:41,939
I start fighting a war, I
guarantee you'll see something new.

826
00:58:49,112 --> 00:58:50,364
We'll get off.

827
00:58:50,405 --> 00:58:52,074
River and I will
get off at Haven.

828
00:58:52,115 --> 00:58:53,909
- We'll find some...
- Nobody's saying that.

829
00:58:53,951 --> 00:58:55,786
Nobody besides Jayne
is saying that.

830
00:58:55,869 --> 00:58:56,870
Mal.

831
00:58:59,331 --> 00:59:02,417
I got no answers for you,
Inara. I got no rudder.

832
00:59:02,501 --> 00:59:05,462
Wind blows northerly, I
go north. That's who I am.

833
00:59:05,546 --> 00:59:08,090
Now, maybe that ain't a man to
lead, but they have to follow.

834
00:59:08,173 --> 00:59:09,258
So you wanna tear me down...

835
00:59:09,341 --> 00:59:11,510
...do it inside your own mind.
- I'm not trying to tear you down.

836
00:59:11,593 --> 00:59:13,178
But you fog things up.

837
00:59:13,971 --> 00:59:15,681
You always have.

838
00:59:17,307 --> 00:59:18,767
You spin me about.

839
00:59:21,979 --> 00:59:24,106
I wish like hell
you was elsewhere.

840
00:59:26,316 --> 00:59:27,401
I was.

841
01:01:00,536 --> 01:01:02,830
No trouble,
little crazy person.

842
01:01:04,832 --> 01:01:08,210
We're going
for a nice shuttle ride.

843
01:01:25,727 --> 01:01:27,521
She's out. Jayne's down.

844
01:01:27,729 --> 01:01:30,232
The other way.
Find her and do not engage.

845
01:01:52,681 --> 01:01:54,183
It's gonna be okay...

846
01:02:04,777 --> 01:02:06,946
She's sealed off the bridge.
I do not like her there.

847
01:02:06,987 --> 01:02:08,697
Check the shuttle.
She could have snuck in.

848
01:02:08,781 --> 01:02:09,740
Captain.

849
01:02:55,828 --> 01:02:58,706
The government's man,
he says you're a danger to us.

850
01:02:59,707 --> 01:03:01,333
Not worth helping.

851
01:03:03,961 --> 01:03:05,129
Is he right?

852
01:03:06,463 --> 01:03:08,841
Are you anything but a weapon?

853
01:03:12,052 --> 01:03:15,139
I've staked my crew's life on
the theory you're a person...

854
01:03:15,222 --> 01:03:18,392
...actual and whole, and if I'm
wrong, you'd best shoot me now.

855
01:03:19,643 --> 01:03:21,520
Or we could talk more.

856
01:03:32,531 --> 01:03:33,657
Miranda.

857
01:03:37,745 --> 01:03:40,164
How can it be there's a
whole planet called Miranda...

858
01:03:40,247 --> 01:03:41,498
...and none of us knowed that?

859
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:44,919
Because there isn't one. It's
a blackrock. Uninabitable.

860
01:03:45,419 --> 01:03:48,506
Terraforming didn't hold, or
some such. Few settlers died.

861
01:03:48,547 --> 01:03:50,090
Was it right before the war?

862
01:03:50,174 --> 01:03:54,053
I had to show them. I didn't know
if you were going to make me sleep.

863
01:03:55,763 --> 01:03:57,848
- You could have asked.
- Wait a tick, yeah.

864
01:03:57,932 --> 01:04:01,560
Some years back, there was call
for workers to settle on Miranda.

865
01:04:01,644 --> 01:04:03,395
- Daddy talked about it.
- Nothing about it...

866
01:04:03,479 --> 01:04:05,523
...on the Cortex. History,
Astronomy, it's not in there.

867
01:04:05,564 --> 01:04:07,900
Half of writing history
is hiding the truth.

868
01:04:07,983 --> 01:04:10,903
There's something on that rock
the Alliance doesn't want known.

869
01:04:10,986 --> 01:04:13,197
That's right at the edge of
the Burnam Quadrant, right?

870
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,574
Furthest planet out?
It's not that far from here.

871
01:04:15,658 --> 01:04:17,409
- Whoa. No. No. Honey...
- That's a bad notion.

872
01:04:17,451 --> 01:04:19,828
...you show them the bad.
- I got it, baby.

873
01:04:23,457 --> 01:04:26,126
This is us, at Haven,
and here's Miranda.

874
01:04:26,710 --> 01:04:30,923
All along here, that empty space
in between, that's Reaver territory.

875
01:04:30,965 --> 01:04:33,676
They just float out there,
sending out raiding parties.

876
01:04:33,759 --> 01:04:36,053
Nobody ventures there.
Not even the Alliance.

877
01:04:36,136 --> 01:04:38,389
You go through that, you're
signing up to be a banquet.

878
01:04:38,430 --> 01:04:41,100
I'm on board with our standard
run-and-hide scenario.

879
01:04:41,141 --> 01:04:42,893
And we are just about...

880
01:04:43,644 --> 01:04:44,645
Wait.

881
01:05:02,037 --> 01:05:04,164
- Doesn't look like Reavers.
- Wasn't.

882
01:05:10,004 --> 01:05:11,005
Shepherd?

883
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:13,924
Shepherd?

884
01:05:15,301 --> 01:05:16,552
Shepherd Book?

885
01:05:37,615 --> 01:05:39,033
Get the Doc.

886
01:05:40,492 --> 01:05:41,452
Shepherd.

887
01:05:42,661 --> 01:05:45,497
- Don't move.
- Won't go far.

888
01:05:48,042 --> 01:05:50,002
Shouldn't have been you.

889
01:05:50,836 --> 01:05:53,464
Alliance should've hit us.
Should've hit me.

890
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:56,550
That crossed my mind.

891
01:06:01,096 --> 01:06:04,225
- I shot him down.
- Yeah. I see.

892
01:06:04,475 --> 01:06:07,019
I killed the ship
that killed us.

893
01:06:08,771 --> 01:06:10,731
Not very Christian of me.

894
01:06:11,232 --> 01:06:12,733
You did what's right.

895
01:06:13,234 --> 01:06:17,279
Coming from you,
that means almost nothing.

896
01:06:22,868 --> 01:06:25,412
- I'm long gone.
- No, Doc will bring you around.

897
01:06:25,496 --> 01:06:28,374
I look to be bored by many
more sermons before you slip.

898
01:06:28,457 --> 01:06:29,708
Just don't move.

899
01:06:30,376 --> 01:06:32,169
Can't order me around, boy.

900
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:35,214
I'm not one of your crew.

901
01:06:37,299 --> 01:06:38,717
Yes, you are.

902
01:06:41,554 --> 01:06:43,389
- River...
- Come on.

903
01:06:43,848 --> 01:06:44,849
Hey.

904
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:50,563
I don't care what you
believe. Just believe it.

905
01:06:52,273 --> 01:06:54,066
Whatever you...

906
01:07:27,516 --> 01:07:29,560
How come
they ain't waiting?

907
01:07:30,728 --> 01:07:33,689
They knowed we was coming,
how come they only sent one?

908
01:07:34,815 --> 01:07:37,151
They didn't know
we were coming here.

909
01:07:37,943 --> 01:07:39,653
Get on the Cortex.

910
01:07:39,778 --> 01:07:41,614
Wave, Li Shen,
the Sanchez brothers...

911
01:07:41,697 --> 01:07:45,201
...anyone who has ever sheltered us
after a heist. Tell them to get out.

912
01:07:45,284 --> 01:07:46,493
Get out now.

913
01:07:57,671 --> 01:07:58,839
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

914
01:08:00,966 --> 01:08:04,762
<i>If your quarry goes to ground,
leave no ground to go to.</i>

915
01:08:05,888 --> 01:08:07,932
<i>You should have taken my offer.</i>

916
01:08:07,973 --> 01:08:10,559
<i>Or did you think none of this
was your fault?</i>

917
01:08:10,809 --> 01:08:12,811
I don't murder children.

918
01:08:13,187 --> 01:08:14,188
<i>I do.</i>

919
01:08:15,147 --> 01:08:17,149
<i>- If I have to.
- Why?</i>

920
01:08:19,026 --> 01:08:21,195
Do you even know
why they sent you?

921
01:08:21,987 --> 01:08:23,739
<i>It's not my place to ask.</i>

922
01:08:24,990 --> 01:08:27,493
<i>I believe in something
greater than myself.</i>

923
01:08:28,619 --> 01:08:29,995
<i>A better world.</i>

924
01:08:30,663 --> 01:08:32,498
<i>A world without sin.</i>

925
01:08:32,998 --> 01:08:35,000
So me and mine
gotta lay down and die...

926
01:08:35,084 --> 01:08:37,294
...so you can live
in your better world?

927
01:08:37,753 --> 01:08:39,880
<i>I'm not going to live there.</i>

928
01:08:40,297 --> 01:08:41,882
<i>There's no place
for me there...</i>

929
01:08:41,966 --> 01:08:44,426
<i>...any more than
there is for you. Malcolm...</i>

930
01:08:44,593 --> 01:08:45,845
<i>I'm a monster.</i>

931
01:08:47,555 --> 01:08:48,848
<i>What I do is evil.</i>

932
01:08:48,889 --> 01:08:51,475
<i>I have no illusions about it,
but it must be done.</i>

933
01:08:51,559 --> 01:08:53,018
Keep talking.

934
01:08:53,310 --> 01:08:55,354
You're not getting a
location trace off this wave.

935
01:08:55,437 --> 01:08:59,358
<i>And every minute you keep River
Tam from me, more people will die.</i>

936
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,902
<i>You think I care?
Of course you care.</i>

937
01:09:02,862 --> 01:09:04,613
<i>You're not a Reaver, Mal.</i>

938
01:09:05,114 --> 01:09:08,576
<i>You're a human man and you
will never understand how...</i>

939
01:09:14,874 --> 01:09:16,667
Get these bodies together.

940
01:09:17,209 --> 01:09:18,502
We got time
for grave digging?

941
01:09:18,586 --> 01:09:20,045
Zoe, you and Simon
rope them together.

942
01:09:20,129 --> 01:09:22,506
Five or six. I want them laid
out on the nose of our ship.

943
01:09:22,590 --> 01:09:23,716
Are you insane?

944
01:09:23,757 --> 01:09:25,050
I won't desecrate
these bodies.

945
01:09:25,134 --> 01:09:27,011
I don't understand. What
do you mean, the bodies...

946
01:09:27,052 --> 01:09:28,512
I want you to muck up
the reactor core.

947
01:09:28,596 --> 01:09:30,598
Just enough to leave a trail
and make it read like...

948
01:09:30,681 --> 01:09:32,850
...we're flying without
containment, not enough to fry us.

949
01:09:32,892 --> 01:09:34,727
- These people are our friends.
- Kaylee...

950
01:09:34,768 --> 01:09:37,605
...you got a day's work to do
and two hours to do it.

951
01:09:38,647 --> 01:09:42,902
Jayne, you and Wash hoist up the
cannon mount. Goes right on top.

952
01:09:42,985 --> 01:09:44,653
Piece or two of the
other ship, stick it on.

953
01:09:44,737 --> 01:09:47,948
Any place you can tear hull
without inner breach, do that, too.

954
01:09:48,782 --> 01:09:52,077
We're gonna need paint.
We're gonna need red paint.

955
01:09:52,578 --> 01:09:53,537
Sir...

956
01:09:54,038 --> 01:09:57,500
...do you really mean to turn
our home into an abomination...

957
01:09:57,583 --> 01:09:59,376
...so that we can make
a suicidal attempt...

958
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:01,462
...at passing through
Reaver space?

959
01:10:01,587 --> 01:10:02,880
I mean to live.

960
01:10:03,297 --> 01:10:04,757
I mean for us to live.

961
01:10:04,798 --> 01:10:07,384
The Alliance won't have that,
so we go where they don't follow.

962
01:10:07,468 --> 01:10:09,637
God's balls, there ain't no
way we're going out there.

963
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:11,430
Mal, think about
what you're asking.

964
01:10:11,472 --> 01:10:13,682
...those Reavers'll
eat us alive...

965
01:10:15,434 --> 01:10:16,810
This is how it is.

966
01:10:17,269 --> 01:10:18,938
Anybody doesn't wanna
fly with me anymore...

967
01:10:19,021 --> 01:10:20,856
...this is your port of harbor.

968
01:10:21,732 --> 01:10:23,734
There's a lot
of fine ways to die.

969
01:10:23,817 --> 01:10:26,570
I ain't waiting for the
Alliance to choose mine.

970
01:10:30,115 --> 01:10:31,617
I mean to confound
these bungers.

971
01:10:31,659 --> 01:10:33,327
Take my shot
at getting to Miranda.

972
01:10:33,410 --> 01:10:35,996
Maybe find something I can use
to get clear of this.

973
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,958
So I hear a word out of any of
you that ain't helping me out...

974
01:10:39,041 --> 01:10:41,544
...or taking your leave,
I will shoot you down.

975
01:10:46,507 --> 01:10:47,800
Get to work.

976
01:11:13,325 --> 01:11:14,368
Sir...

977
01:11:14,451 --> 01:11:16,287
Just tell me
when we're close.

978
01:12:23,479 --> 01:12:24,480
Wash.

979
01:13:29,128 --> 01:13:32,339
Define "disappeared. "

980
01:13:37,094 --> 01:13:39,346
Every reading
I'm getting says normal.

981
01:13:40,097 --> 01:13:43,434
Oceans, land masses. No tectonic
instability or radiation.

982
01:13:43,475 --> 01:13:46,478
- Yeah, but no power, either.
- Nothing at all?

983
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:47,521
Wait.

984
01:13:48,189 --> 01:13:49,273
Something.

985
01:13:50,357 --> 01:13:52,818
It might be a beacon,
but it's awful weak.

986
01:13:53,485 --> 01:13:54,945
Find it.

987
01:14:03,245 --> 01:14:04,872
Gravity's Earthnorm.

988
01:14:05,539 --> 01:14:07,791
O2 levels check,
pressure...

989
01:14:08,542 --> 01:14:11,337
If anything's wrong the
scanner's not reading it.

990
01:14:17,176 --> 01:14:19,595
Well, something sure
the hell ain't right.

991
01:14:22,515 --> 01:14:23,849
This ain't
no little settlement.

992
01:14:23,891 --> 01:14:26,685
We flew over at least a
dozen cities just as big.

993
01:14:26,810 --> 01:14:29,021
Why didn't we ever
hear about this?

994
01:14:31,023 --> 01:14:32,441
Beacon's up ahead.

995
01:14:55,506 --> 01:14:56,507
Ho.

996
01:15:16,569 --> 01:15:18,904
No entry wounds,
fractures.

997
01:15:19,405 --> 01:15:20,573
Poison?

998
01:15:33,252 --> 01:15:34,879
Got another one.

999
01:15:40,426 --> 01:15:42,178
They's just sitting here.

1000
01:15:43,888 --> 01:15:45,097
They didn't crash.

1001
01:15:59,695 --> 01:16:01,238
Kaylee. Don't...

1002
01:16:06,994 --> 01:16:09,246
How come these ones
are preserved?

1003
01:16:09,788 --> 01:16:11,916
Place must've gone hermetic
when the power blew.

1004
01:16:11,999 --> 01:16:14,627
- Sealed them.
- What are they doing?

1005
01:16:15,836 --> 01:16:17,755
What's everybody doing?

1006
01:16:17,963 --> 01:16:20,466
There's no unusual
discoloration.

1007
01:16:21,008 --> 01:16:23,761
Nobody's doubled over
or showing signs of pain.

1008
01:16:24,178 --> 01:16:26,472
There's gasses
that kill painless, right?

1009
01:16:26,805 --> 01:16:29,183
They didn't fall.
None of them.

1010
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:31,310
They just lay down.

1011
01:16:35,064 --> 01:16:38,317
Make them stop.
They're everywhere.

1012
01:16:39,235 --> 01:16:41,362
Every city, every...

1013
01:16:41,654 --> 01:16:44,573
Every house, every room,
they're all inside me.

1014
01:16:44,657 --> 01:16:48,077
I can hear them all,
and they're saying nothing!

1015
01:16:49,119 --> 01:16:50,120
Get up.

1016
01:16:51,247 --> 01:16:52,706
Please get up.

1017
01:16:57,503 --> 01:16:59,797
Please, God,
make me a stone.

1018
01:17:01,006 --> 01:17:02,842
She is starting
to damage my calm.

1019
01:17:02,925 --> 01:17:04,426
- Jayne.
- She's right!

1020
01:17:05,469 --> 01:17:07,096
Everybody's dead.

1021
01:17:08,556 --> 01:17:10,850
This whole world is dead
for no reason!

1022
01:17:13,310 --> 01:17:15,187
Let's get to the beacon.

1023
01:17:41,213 --> 01:17:43,174
This is the source?

1024
01:17:46,510 --> 01:17:48,721
This ship's banged up
all to hell.

1025
01:18:05,988 --> 01:18:08,782
<i>These are just a few of
the few images we've recorded.</i>

1026
01:18:09,909 --> 01:18:11,494
<i>And you can see...</i>

1027
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,663
<i>...it isn't what we thought.</i>

1028
01:18:16,248 --> 01:18:17,750
<i>There's been no war here...</i>

1029
01:18:18,751 --> 01:18:21,879
<i>...and no terraforming event.
The environment is stable.</i>

1030
01:18:26,967 --> 01:18:28,385
<i>It's the Pax.</i>

1031
01:18:29,929 --> 01:18:34,266
<i>The G-23 Paxilon Hydroclorate that
we added to the air processors.</i>

1032
01:18:35,226 --> 01:18:38,938
<i>It was supposed to calm the
population, weed out aggression.</i>

1033
01:18:41,065 --> 01:18:42,691
<i>Well, it works.</i>

1034
01:18:43,609 --> 01:18:45,986
<i>The people here
stopped fighting.</i>

1035
01:18:46,946 --> 01:18:49,573
<i>And then they stopped
everything else.</i>

1036
01:18:54,495 --> 01:18:56,705
<i>They stopped going to work...</i>

1037
01:18:57,623 --> 01:19:01,836
<i>...they stopped breeding,
talking, eating.</i>

1038
01:19:03,671 --> 01:19:07,967
<i>There's 30 million people here, and
they all just let themselves die.</i>

1039
01:19:11,011 --> 01:19:12,471
<i>I have to be quick.</i>

1040
01:19:13,556 --> 01:19:15,224
<i>About a tenth
of a percent of...</i>

1041
01:19:15,307 --> 01:19:17,643
<i>...the population had the
opposite reaction to the Pax.</i>

1042
01:19:18,269 --> 01:19:21,939
<i>Their aggressor response
increased beyond madness.</i>

1043
01:19:22,398 --> 01:19:23,607
<i>They have become...</i>

1044
01:19:25,943 --> 01:19:27,611
<i>Well, they've killed
most of us.</i>

1045
01:19:28,696 --> 01:19:30,489
<i>And not just killed...</i>

1046
01:19:32,283 --> 01:19:34,034
<i>...they've done things.</i>

1047
01:19:34,535 --> 01:19:37,663
Reavers. They made them.

1048
01:19:39,331 --> 01:19:43,460
<i>I won't live to report this,
but people have to know.</i>

1049
01:19:44,712 --> 01:19:46,505
<i>We meant it for the best...</i>

1050
01:19:47,006 --> 01:19:48,340
<i>...to make people safer.</i>

1051
01:19:50,176 --> 01:19:53,220
<i>God!</i>

1052
01:19:58,058 --> 01:19:59,935
Turn it off.

1053
01:20:24,627 --> 01:20:27,546
- River.
- I'm all right.

1054
01:20:35,554 --> 01:20:37,014
I'm all right.

1055
01:20:45,272 --> 01:20:47,733
<i>This report is maybe
12 years old.</i>

1056
01:20:48,734 --> 01:20:52,613
Parliament buried it, and it
stayed buried till River dug it up.

1057
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:56,659
This is what
they feared she knew.

1058
01:20:57,243 --> 01:20:59,119
And they were
right to fear...

1059
01:20:59,703 --> 01:21:02,665
...because there's a whole universe
of folk who are gonna know it, too.

1060
01:21:02,748 --> 01:21:04,375
They're gonna see it.

1061
01:21:04,959 --> 01:21:07,670
Somebody has to speak
for these people.

1062
01:21:11,090 --> 01:21:13,425
You all got on this boat
for different reasons...

1063
01:21:13,509 --> 01:21:15,678
...but you all come
to the same place.

1064
01:21:16,095 --> 01:21:19,265
So now I'm asking more of you
than I have before.

1065
01:21:20,391 --> 01:21:21,725
Maybe all.

1066
01:21:23,686 --> 01:21:26,897
Sure as I know anything I
know this, they will try again.

1067
01:21:28,274 --> 01:21:30,734
Maybe on another world, maybe
on this very ground swept clean.

1068
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:33,654
A year from now, 10, they'll
swing back to the belief...

1069
01:21:33,779 --> 01:21:35,906
...that they can make people...

1070
01:21:38,617 --> 01:21:39,618
...better.

1071
01:21:42,788 --> 01:21:44,832
And I do not hold to that.

1072
01:21:47,126 --> 01:21:48,586
So no more running.

1073
01:21:51,130 --> 01:21:52,798
I aim to misbehave.

1074
01:22:00,639 --> 01:22:02,892
Shepherd Book
used to tell me:

1075
01:22:02,975 --> 01:22:05,060
"If you can't do
something smart...

1076
01:22:06,562 --> 01:22:08,355
..."do something right. "

1077
01:22:09,648 --> 01:22:12,318
- Do we have a plan?
- Mr. Universe.

1078
01:22:12,943 --> 01:22:14,945
We haven't the equipment
to broadwave this code...

1079
01:22:15,029 --> 01:22:17,489
...but he can put it
on every screen for 30 worlds.

1080
01:22:18,157 --> 01:22:19,909
He's pretty damn close, too.

1081
01:22:20,451 --> 01:22:21,535
We still got the Reavers...

1082
01:22:21,619 --> 01:22:23,871
...and probably the Alliance,
between us and him.

1083
01:22:24,163 --> 01:22:26,832
That's two armies against
our one bitty cannon.

1084
01:22:27,041 --> 01:22:30,044
It's a fair bet the Alliance
knows about Mr. Universe.

1085
01:22:30,127 --> 01:22:31,587
They're gonna
see this coming.

1086
01:22:32,713 --> 01:22:33,714
No.

1087
01:22:35,799 --> 01:22:38,093
They're not gonna
see this coming.

1088
01:22:46,352 --> 01:22:48,270
<i>No problem. Bring it on.
Bring it on. Bring it on.</i>

1089
01:22:48,687 --> 01:22:51,315
<i>From here to the eyes and ears
of the 'verse. That's my motto...</i>

1090
01:22:51,398 --> 01:22:53,817
<i>...or it might be,
if I start having a motto.</i>

1091
01:22:53,859 --> 01:22:54,902
We won't be long.

1092
01:22:54,985 --> 01:22:56,987
<i>You're going to get caught
in the ion cloud.</i>

1093
01:22:57,029 --> 01:22:58,656
<i>It'll play merry hob
with your radar...</i>

1094
01:22:58,739 --> 01:23:01,617
<i>...but pretty lights and a few miles
after you'll be right in my orbit.</i>

1095
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:03,911
You'll let us know
if anyone else comes at you?

1096
01:23:03,994 --> 01:23:05,704
You'll be the first.

1097
01:23:11,794 --> 01:23:12,962
There.

1098
01:23:13,212 --> 01:23:15,548
Toss me my 30 coin,
but I got a newswave for you...

1099
01:23:25,599 --> 01:23:28,727
Call in every ship in the quadrant.
We'll meet them in the air.

1100
01:23:30,396 --> 01:23:31,897
Destroy it all.

1101
01:23:58,632 --> 01:24:01,051
<i>Wash, we almost through?</i>

1102
01:24:23,032 --> 01:24:24,033
<i>Now!</i>

1103
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:31,248
Go! Move!

1104
01:24:50,935 --> 01:24:55,105
- I'm reading activity in the cloud.
- Lock and fire on my command.

1105
01:24:57,233 --> 01:24:59,527
You should have
let me see her, Captain.

1106
01:25:00,653 --> 01:25:04,490
We should have done this
as men. Not with fire.

1107
01:25:04,865 --> 01:25:06,075
Sir.

1108
01:25:11,288 --> 01:25:13,040
- Vessel in range.
- Lock on.

1109
01:25:20,965 --> 01:25:22,883
Bastard's not even
changing course.

1110
01:25:28,013 --> 01:25:29,014
Sir!

1111
01:25:32,643 --> 01:25:35,729
Target the Reavers.
Target the Reavers!

1112
01:25:35,813 --> 01:25:38,107
Target everyone!
Somebody fire!

1113
01:25:55,666 --> 01:25:59,962
I am a leaf on the wind.
Watch how I soar.

1114
01:26:14,393 --> 01:26:16,103
Chicken's come home
to roost.

1115
01:26:17,563 --> 01:26:19,648
- The hell?
- It's okay.

1116
01:26:19,899 --> 01:26:22,193
- I am a leaf on the wind!
- What does that mean?

1117
01:26:26,405 --> 01:26:27,907
We're almost through.

1118
01:26:44,590 --> 01:26:47,009
- No! No! No!
- Yes! Yes!

1119
01:27:39,979 --> 01:27:41,480
We're not alone.

1120
01:27:49,071 --> 01:27:50,114
EMP!

1121
01:27:50,197 --> 01:27:51,991
Everybody, strap yourselves
into something!

1122
01:27:52,032 --> 01:27:53,033
- Jayne.
- Got it.

1123
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:56,120
Kaylee, come on.

1124
01:28:08,883 --> 01:28:11,302
- We're fried. I got no control.
- Where's the backup?

1125
01:28:11,844 --> 01:28:13,888
Where's the backup?

1126
01:28:21,270 --> 01:28:22,646
Check! Check!

1127
01:28:47,379 --> 01:28:48,422
Get up!

1128
01:28:48,506 --> 01:28:49,798
Stop it!

1129
01:28:54,887 --> 01:28:57,014
Backup reads at 20%.
Can you get us down?

1130
01:28:57,056 --> 01:29:00,142
- I'm going to have to glide her in.
- Will that work?

1131
01:29:54,947 --> 01:29:56,657
I am a leaf on the wind.

1132
01:29:59,034 --> 01:30:00,828
Watch how...

1133
01:30:02,955 --> 01:30:07,418
Wash, baby. Baby, no. Baby,
come on. You gotta go. Come on.

1134
01:30:07,459 --> 01:30:11,130
We gotta move. Baby, please.
We gotta move, baby, come on.

1135
01:30:14,466 --> 01:30:15,467
Zoe!

1136
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:18,470
Move out! Now!

1137
01:30:22,516 --> 01:30:23,559
Go. Go.

1138
01:30:24,226 --> 01:30:25,561
Head inside!

1139
01:30:44,622 --> 01:30:46,207
Jayne, rearguard.

1140
01:30:53,839 --> 01:30:56,008
- Zoe, what've we got?
- Sir...

1141
01:30:58,010 --> 01:30:59,303
...this is a good hold point.

1142
01:30:59,637 --> 01:31:01,263
- We all stay together.
- No.

1143
01:31:01,347 --> 01:31:02,515
They have to come
through here.

1144
01:31:02,598 --> 01:31:04,517
They'll bottleneck,
we can thin them out.

1145
01:31:04,642 --> 01:31:07,394
We get pushed back,
there's the blast doors.

1146
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:09,855
I can rig them so they
won't reopen once they close.

1147
01:31:09,939 --> 01:31:10,981
Shut them
and hide until I get...

1148
01:31:11,023 --> 01:31:12,983
We need to draw them
till it's done.

1149
01:31:14,151 --> 01:31:16,529
This is the place.
We'll buy you the time.

1150
01:31:21,367 --> 01:31:23,828
All right, let's move those
crates back there for cover.

1151
01:31:23,869 --> 01:31:26,372
Make sure they ain't filled
with nothing goes boom.

1152
01:31:26,705 --> 01:31:28,749
Wait, Wash!
Where's Wash?

1153
01:31:29,875 --> 01:31:31,460
He ain't coming.

1154
01:31:36,590 --> 01:31:38,676
Move the gorramn crates!

1155
01:31:56,360 --> 01:31:58,863
Tell me you brought them
this time.

1156
01:32:21,552 --> 01:32:22,803
Zoe?

1157
01:32:25,014 --> 01:32:27,600
- Are you here?
- Do the job, sir.

1158
01:32:30,186 --> 01:32:32,813
You hold.
Hold till I get back.

1159
01:32:36,901 --> 01:32:37,943
Captain's right.

1160
01:32:38,027 --> 01:32:41,071
Can't be thinking on revenge
if we're gonna get through this.

1161
01:32:41,113 --> 01:32:43,741
Do you really think any of
us are gonna get through this?

1162
01:32:47,328 --> 01:32:48,370
I might.

1163
01:33:05,429 --> 01:33:06,430
No.

1164
01:33:27,993 --> 01:33:28,953
<i>Mal.</i>

1165
01:33:29,829 --> 01:33:31,580
<i>Guy killed me, Mal.</i>

1166
01:33:31,956 --> 01:33:35,167
<i>He killed me with a sword.
How weird is that?</i>

1167
01:33:36,043 --> 01:33:39,964
<i>I got a short span here.</i>

1168
01:33:41,423 --> 01:33:43,175
<i>They destroyed my equipment...</i>

1169
01:33:43,509 --> 01:33:45,094
<i>...but I have a backup unit.</i>

1170
01:33:45,177 --> 01:33:47,555
<i>Bottom of the complex,
right over the generator.</i>

1171
01:33:48,013 --> 01:33:51,141
<i>Hard to get to.
I know they missed it.</i>

1172
01:33:51,976 --> 01:33:54,186
<i>They can't stop
the signal, Mal.</i>

1173
01:33:55,062 --> 01:33:57,481
<i>They can never
stop the signal.</i>

1174
01:34:01,694 --> 01:34:04,071
The Reavers.
They are all made up of rage.

1175
01:34:04,155 --> 01:34:06,949
- It's okay. It's okay.
- I can't shut them up.

1176
01:34:10,744 --> 01:34:11,912
Stay low.

1177
01:34:12,454 --> 01:34:15,916
She picked a sweet bung of
a time to go helpless on us.

1178
01:34:17,126 --> 01:34:18,252
Jayne and I take
the first wave.

1179
01:34:18,335 --> 01:34:20,838
Nobody shoots unless
they get past our fire.

1180
01:34:24,717 --> 01:34:27,344
I didn't plan
on going out like this.

1181
01:34:29,180 --> 01:34:31,348
I think we did right, but...

1182
01:34:32,433 --> 01:34:36,729
No. I never planned...
anything.

1183
01:34:38,731 --> 01:34:40,900
I just wanted
to keep River safe.

1184
01:34:44,653 --> 01:34:48,324
Spent so much time on "Serenity"
ignoring anything...

1185
01:34:49,283 --> 01:34:51,785
...that I wanted for myself.

1186
01:34:56,540 --> 01:34:58,918
My one regret
in all of this...

1187
01:35:00,252 --> 01:35:01,962
...is never being with you.

1188
01:35:04,048 --> 01:35:05,382
With me?

1189
01:35:07,176 --> 01:35:09,178
You mean to say, as...

1190
01:35:11,096 --> 01:35:12,223
Sex?

1191
01:35:14,475 --> 01:35:16,268
I mean to say.

1192
01:35:21,273 --> 01:35:24,401
Hell with this.
I'm gonna live.

1193
01:35:38,290 --> 01:35:41,669
<i>Mal. Guy killed me, Mal.</i>

1194
01:35:42,795 --> 01:35:44,421
<i>He killed me with a sword.</i>

1195
01:36:23,169 --> 01:36:24,753
"Hard to get to. "

1196
01:36:26,005 --> 01:36:27,715
That's a fact.

1197
01:36:35,014 --> 01:36:36,473
Zoe, gorrammit!

1198
01:36:52,364 --> 01:36:54,700
Zoe, get your ass
back on the line!

1199
01:37:11,217 --> 01:37:12,885
You shot me in the back!

1200
01:37:14,553 --> 01:37:17,014
I haven't made you
angry, have I?

1201
01:37:17,056 --> 01:37:20,226
There are a lot of innocent people
in the air being killed right now.

1202
01:37:20,309 --> 01:37:22,728
You have no idea
how true that is.

1203
01:37:24,188 --> 01:37:25,856
I know the secret.

1204
01:37:26,607 --> 01:37:29,068
The truth that burned up
River Tam's brain.

1205
01:37:29,860 --> 01:37:33,906
Rest of the 'verse is going to
know it, too. 'Cause they need to.

1206
01:37:35,866 --> 01:37:39,203
- Do you really believe that?
- I do.

1207
01:37:39,578 --> 01:37:41,705
You willing to die
for that belief?

1208
01:37:44,124 --> 01:37:45,334
I am.

1209
01:37:52,091 --> 01:37:54,176
Of course,
that ain't exactly Plan A.

1210
01:38:20,786 --> 01:38:22,913
- Spine's intact.
- Just give me a bandage.

1211
01:39:16,592 --> 01:39:18,010
Up high, left!

1212
01:39:25,768 --> 01:39:27,186
Kaylee!

1213
01:39:39,865 --> 01:39:43,786
Fall back! Everybody,
fall back! Fall back now!

1214
01:39:53,379 --> 01:39:54,713
Jayne, grenade.

1215
01:39:56,048 --> 01:39:58,217
Very last one.

1216
01:40:04,265 --> 01:40:05,349
They're gonna get in.

1217
01:40:05,724 --> 01:40:08,394
I can close it
from the outside.

1218
01:40:08,811 --> 01:40:10,813
No one's coming
back from that.

1219
01:40:13,816 --> 01:40:15,734
How much ammo
do we have?

1220
01:40:15,860 --> 01:40:19,738
Three, four max, and my
swinging cod. That's all.

1221
01:40:19,822 --> 01:40:20,865
The lift isn't moving.

1222
01:40:20,906 --> 01:40:23,409
When they come, try to
plug the hole with it.

1223
01:40:23,450 --> 01:40:25,911
I'm starting to lose
some feeling here.

1224
01:40:25,953 --> 01:40:28,664
Lie still. I'm going
to give you something...

1225
01:40:30,708 --> 01:40:31,709
My bag.

1226
01:40:42,011 --> 01:40:43,554
Keep pressure here.

1227
01:40:45,306 --> 01:40:46,307
My bag.

1228
01:40:46,849 --> 01:40:47,850
I need...

1229
01:40:48,684 --> 01:40:52,146
...adrenaline and a shot of...

1230
01:40:52,646 --> 01:40:54,231
...calaphar for Kaylee.

1231
01:40:56,942 --> 01:40:58,652
I can't.

1232
01:41:02,531 --> 01:41:03,532
River.

1233
01:41:08,621 --> 01:41:11,290
- River, I'm sorry.
- No.

1234
01:41:12,666 --> 01:41:13,792
No.

1235
01:41:20,966 --> 01:41:23,219
- I hate to leave.
- You won't.

1236
01:41:26,138 --> 01:41:28,766
You take care of me, Simon.

1237
01:41:31,810 --> 01:41:34,438
You've always
taken care of me.

1238
01:41:39,819 --> 01:41:40,945
My turn.

1239
01:42:35,833 --> 01:42:38,460
Do you know
what your sin is, Mal?

1240
01:42:39,044 --> 01:42:42,381
Hell. I'm a fan
of all seven.

1241
01:42:48,929 --> 01:42:50,723
But right now...

1242
01:42:51,765 --> 01:42:53,726
I'm going to have
to go with wrath.

1243
01:42:58,230 --> 01:43:00,691
We ain't got long.

1244
01:43:06,739 --> 01:43:08,574
You suppose he got through?

1245
01:43:09,867 --> 01:43:11,827
Do you think Mal
got the word out?

1246
01:43:12,495 --> 01:43:16,916
He got through.
I know he got through.

1247
01:43:28,177 --> 01:43:29,178
I'm sorry.

1248
01:43:32,473 --> 01:43:35,267
You should know
there's no shame in this.

1249
01:43:37,436 --> 01:43:39,563
You've done remarkable things.

1250
01:43:40,814 --> 01:43:43,025
But you're fighting a war...

1251
01:43:44,235 --> 01:43:45,402
...you've already lost.

1252
01:43:50,282 --> 01:43:52,159
Well, I'm known for that.

1253
01:44:01,085 --> 01:44:04,713
Piece of shrapnel tore up that
nerve cluster my first tour.

1254
01:44:05,297 --> 01:44:06,632
Had it moved.

1255
01:44:08,217 --> 01:44:09,635
Sorry about the throat.

1256
01:44:10,261 --> 01:44:13,097
Expect you'd want to say your
famous last words right now.

1257
01:44:14,139 --> 01:44:15,724
Just one trouble.

1258
01:44:20,479 --> 01:44:21,939
I ain't gonna kill you.

1259
01:44:25,442 --> 01:44:28,529
Hell, I'm gonna grant
your greatest wish.

1260
01:44:35,870 --> 01:44:38,706
I'm gonna show you
a world without sin.

1261
01:44:44,545 --> 01:44:46,630
<i>These are just a few of
the few images we've recorded.</i>

1262
01:44:46,672 --> 01:44:47,673
<i>And you can see...</i>

1263
01:44:50,593 --> 01:44:52,761
<i>...it isn't what we thought.</i>

1264
01:44:54,471 --> 01:44:56,348
<i>There's been no war here...</i>

1265
01:44:57,016 --> 01:45:01,312
<i>...and no terraforming event.
The environment is stable.</i>

1266
01:45:02,980 --> 01:45:04,732
<i>It's the Pax.</i>

1267
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:10,738
<i>The G-23 Paxilon Hydroclorate that
we added to the air processors.</i>

1268
01:45:11,447 --> 01:45:14,033
<i>It was supposed to calm
the population...</i>

1269
01:45:42,645 --> 01:45:44,313
<i>We meant it for the best...</i>

1270
01:45:45,231 --> 01:45:46,774
<i>...to make people safer.</i>

1271
01:45:48,567 --> 01:45:49,860
<i>God!</i>

1272
01:46:12,716 --> 01:46:15,177
- Sir?
- It's done.

1273
01:46:18,347 --> 01:46:19,682
Report.

1274
01:46:21,851 --> 01:46:23,018
River?

1275
01:46:48,586 --> 01:46:49,587
Drop your weapons!

1276
01:46:49,628 --> 01:46:50,671
Do it now.

1277
01:46:50,754 --> 01:46:52,214
- Weapons down.
- Let it down, now.

1278
01:46:52,298 --> 01:46:53,883
I want to see
your hands in the air.

1279
01:46:53,966 --> 01:46:55,801
- Stand down.
- Do it.

1280
01:47:01,307 --> 01:47:02,766
Targets are acquired.

1281
01:47:02,808 --> 01:47:04,226
<i>Do we have a kill order?</i>

1282
01:47:07,188 --> 01:47:08,981
<i>Do we have an order?</i>

1283
01:47:17,114 --> 01:47:18,365
<i>Stand down.</i>

1284
01:47:19,492 --> 01:47:22,286
<i>Stand down. It's finished.</i>

1285
01:47:26,040 --> 01:47:27,416
<i>We're finished.</i>

1286
01:49:29,788 --> 01:49:31,665
It's not over,
you know.

1287
01:49:33,375 --> 01:49:36,086
I can't guarantee that
they won't come after you.

1288
01:49:36,921 --> 01:49:37,922
The Parliament.

1289
01:49:38,797 --> 01:49:41,759
Your broadwave about Miranda
has weakened their regime.

1290
01:49:41,842 --> 01:49:46,222
They are not gone
and they are not... forgiving.

1291
01:49:46,805 --> 01:49:49,266
That don't bode
especially well for you...

1292
01:49:49,975 --> 01:49:53,020
...giving the order to let us go,
patching up our hurt.

1293
01:49:54,396 --> 01:49:57,817
I told them the Tams were no
longer a threat, damage done.

1294
01:49:58,359 --> 01:49:59,902
They might listen...

1295
01:50:00,653 --> 01:50:04,031
...but I think they know
I'm no longer their man.

1296
01:50:05,825 --> 01:50:08,911
They take you down, I don't
expect to grieve over much.

1297
01:50:11,163 --> 01:50:13,582
Like to kill you myself,
I see you again.

1298
01:50:14,416 --> 01:50:15,417
You won't.

1299
01:50:18,337 --> 01:50:20,548
There is nothing left to see.

1300
01:50:26,262 --> 01:50:27,805
Sir, we have
a green light.

1301
01:50:28,180 --> 01:50:30,432
Inspection's pos and
we're clear for up-thrust.

1302
01:50:36,939 --> 01:50:39,024
Think she'll hold together?

1303
01:50:40,025 --> 01:50:42,653
She's tore up plenty.
But she'll fly true.

1304
01:50:46,991 --> 01:50:49,201
Make sure
everything's secure.

1305
01:50:51,078 --> 01:50:53,998
- Could be bumpy.
- Always is.

1306
01:51:01,380 --> 01:51:02,423
Taking her out...

1307
01:51:02,506 --> 01:51:05,050
...should be about a day's ride
to get you back to your girls.

1308
01:51:05,134 --> 01:51:06,302
Right.

1309
01:51:07,720 --> 01:51:09,930
Ready to get off this heap,
back to civilized life?

1310
01:51:10,014 --> 01:51:11,015
I, uh...

1311
01:51:15,769 --> 01:51:17,146
I don't know.

1312
01:51:19,148 --> 01:51:20,316
Good answer.

1313
01:51:45,549 --> 01:51:48,052
So, you gonna ride shotgun
with me, help me fly?

1314
01:51:48,302 --> 01:51:49,553
That's the plan.

1315
01:51:50,221 --> 01:51:51,764
Think you can work out...

1316
01:51:59,438 --> 01:52:00,397
Okay.

1317
01:52:01,774 --> 01:52:04,902
Clearly some
aptitude for the...

1318
01:52:06,445 --> 01:52:08,948
It ain't all buttons
and charts, little albatross.

1319
01:52:09,406 --> 01:52:11,534
You know what the first rule
of flying is?

1320
01:52:12,034 --> 01:52:15,037
Well, I suppose you do, since you
already know what I'm about to say.

1321
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:17,540
I do.

1322
01:52:18,707 --> 01:52:20,417
But I like to hear you say it.

1323
01:52:25,256 --> 01:52:26,257
Love.

1324
01:52:26,590 --> 01:52:28,467
You can learn all the math
in the 'verse...

1325
01:52:28,551 --> 01:52:30,594
...but you take a boat in
the air that you don't love...

1326
01:52:30,636 --> 01:52:33,514
...she'll shake you off just as
sure as the turn of the worlds.

1327
01:52:36,851 --> 01:52:39,562
Love keeps her in the air
when she ought to fall down...

1328
01:52:41,021 --> 01:52:43,357
...tells you she's hurting
before she keels.

1329
01:52:46,152 --> 01:52:47,403
Makes her a home.

1330
01:52:52,992 --> 01:52:54,827
Storm's getting worse.

1331
01:52:57,163 --> 01:52:59,832
We'll pass through it
soon enough.

1332
01:53:20,936 --> 01:53:21,854
<i>What was that?</i>
