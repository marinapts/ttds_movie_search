00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
BLACK BOOK

2
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.300
I'll take a photograph.

3
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.100
You are disturbing the lesson.
You may watch, but don't take pictures.

4
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.300
I don't speak Hebrew ... but you speak Dutch?

5
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.200
Aren't you Ellis de Vries from The Hague?

6
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.400
Ronnie?

7
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.000
El, what are you doing here?

8
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.900
- I live here, this is my country.
- Are you Jewish?

9
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.200
- What are you doing in Israel?
- Accompanying my husband.

10
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.200
Him, with that collar.

11
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.200
George. He suddenly 'got religion'
because of the war, the doctor says.

12
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.900
So, a lot of Jesus and no sins like that.
It's nice and quiet at night.

13
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.900
The last man I saw you with,
wasn't he a Canadian?

14
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.900
That's him. That's my Canadian.

15
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.300
How the hell did you end up here?

16
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.100
Bye sweetheart. I'll write.
I'll send pictures. Bye Ellis.

17
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.900
It's "Rachel Rosenthal." I'm married.

18
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.100
- Write down "Rachel Rosenthal"
- Address?

19
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.100
- De kibbutz Stein.
- Shalom. That's what it's called, isn't it? Shalom?

20
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.900
Shalom!

21
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.900
And Jesus said
"Light of the world,

22
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.900
light of life"

23
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.200
Jantje, Stientje, you're up today.

24
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.700
Good morning, Mrs. Tjepkema.
Good morning, children.

25
00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.000
- Good morning, miss
- Good morning, Rachel

26
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
We promised not to say Rachel 
anymore, remember? Never.

27
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.200
It's clearing up. Tonight
I want the stables clean.

28
00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.700
- OK, boss.
- At your seats, go.

29
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.900
Father, could you do a prayer?

30
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.800
Our guest probably learned
a new text.

31
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.800
Good, close your eyes.

32
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.500
And Jesus spoke again to them:
"I am the light of the world."

33
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
"Who will follow me, shall not walk in darkness"

34
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
"but will have the light of life."
- Amen.

35
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.400
Amen.

36
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.400
Beautiful, and no slip of the tongue.
Stientje, give her a plate.

37
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.500
If the Jews had listened to Jesus,

38
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.500
then they wouldn't have had
all this suffering. Then again ...

39
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.100
Please begin.

40
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.100
Here.

41
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.700
Hey, you there, girl!
English music is forbidden!

42
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.600
But not for naked girls!

43
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.600
You're not funny. You scared me.
I thought you were a Kraut.

44
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.500
How can I make it up to you?

45
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.500
Have me on the boat.

46
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.700
- I'd like a one of those ciggarettes, too.
- Jawohl.

47
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.300
- What's that crazy guy doing?
- Getting rid of ballast, so he can ascend.

48
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.500
Get down.

49
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
- What are you going to do?
- That's my hideout!

50
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.100
Wait, look: Germans.

51
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.300
You can't go back, come.

52
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.800
[Unknown voice]: Enjoy your meal, boy.

53
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.800
Hey, take it easy, boy.

54
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.800
That voice on the record ...

55
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
- That's you.
- That was me.

56
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:29.100
In the old days. Before the war.

57
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.200
First you sing, then you 
have to keep your mouth shut.

58
00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.200
Here, my Dad caught these for us.

59
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.300
That's sweet of him.

60
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.600
Will you light the stove?

61
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.200
- It's nice.
- You can keep it.

62
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.200
- Really?
- A souvenir for the one who saved me.

63
00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.300
How sweet.

64
00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.200
Thank you.

65
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.200
- With a positive side effect.
- What do you mean?

66
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.300
Now I don't have to spit anymore 
bible texts to get food.

67
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:20.100
Sshhh ...

68
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.100
A car. It's a gasoline engine.

69
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.600
Miss Stein?

70
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.200
Rachel Stein?

71
00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.200
I know you're here.

72
00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:59.300
The Germans found your pass at the burnt out farm.

73
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.700
Helmsman Maalderink, the Krauts know
you were in the neighborhood.

74
00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.200
They wrote down the number of your sail.

75
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.400
- Says who?
- Come on ...

76
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.400
One plus one is two, even for the Krauts.

77
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.400
A hidden jewish woman dissappears, 

78
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.400
and the only sailor around to help is you?

79
00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.400
- What are you doing here?
- Warning you.

80
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.500
Soon the SD will come and arrest her for transport to Poland.

81
00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:31.100
And you and your family will be put in jail for aiding Jews.

82
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.200
How did this news reach you?

83
00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.900
The police report of the krauts landed
in the hands of the The Hague police.

84
00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.900
- They gave it to us.
- "Us"? Who's "us"?

85
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.300
"Us" is "us". Be happy that there're
so many good cops in Holland.

86
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.100
I wanted to tell you one thing: Hide. 
Now.

87
00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.900
Good night.

88
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.300
- Wasn't I clear enough?
- You have to help me and Rob to go into hiding.

89
00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.100
With 'us' you mean The Resistance. You're
with them. So you can help us, right?

90
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.200
- Maybe yes, but it's dangerous.
- We'll take that risk.

91
00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:20.500
Please don't let us down.
Please?

92
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.500
There's an escape route, through the Biesbosch.
I can get you to liberated territory.

93
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Cross country, now?
That's madness.

94
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.300
In a few weeks the Tommys will
be here and Holland will be liberated.

95
00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.300
Your Tommys have been cut to pieces at Arnhem.

96
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.500
Choose: come with me or take care of yourself.

97
00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:40.900
Wait -- we'll come.

98
00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.900
Be ready tomorrow, two o'clock.
I'll pick you up.

99
00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:51.100
Don't bring too much, but make sure
you can hold out for a while.

100
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
It's here. I'll wait on the corner.

101
00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:31.700
- Yes?
- I'm here for the notary.

102
00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.300
I am Rachel Stein.

103
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.100
Follow me,
I will check for you.

104
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.500
[Mrs. Smaal]: Wim, there's girl called Stein
here. Do you have a moment?

105
00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.100
My husband can see you now.

106
00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.600
- Smaal.
- Rachel Stein.

107
00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.100
My father said to call on you for help, if ever I was in trouble.

108
00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.100
Every young lady can call herself Rachel Stein.

109
00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.900
My parents and my little brother.

110
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
What can I do for you Rachel?

111
00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.300
My hideout was blown up.
I have no papers, nothing.

112
00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.600
I have a chance to cross over to liberated area.

113
00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:36.200
- Really?
- Yes.

114
00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.200
I will need money to live.

115
00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.000
How much?

116
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
At least enough to last me a year.

117
00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.900
100,000?

118
00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.700
No, that's impossible.

119
00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:57.300
Half of it?

120
00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.100
In dollars and jewels, if possible.
I don't want it to take up too much space.

121
00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.300
You'll have to sign the receipt.

122
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.500
I have to justify this to your father later on.

123
00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.600
Do you know where my parents are?

124
00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.700
No, I don't know. 
And I don't want to know.

125
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.800
- Where do I sign?
- Here.

126
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.900
Hold on, you don't want to check first?

127
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.600
No, I trust you.

128
00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:36.700
Rachel, you can't trust someone blindly.
Those times are over.

129
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.400
Checkpoint: Show me you papers.

130
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.500
Van Gein, from the SD, with a load of arrested Jews.

131
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
10 pieces

132
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.300
- Check. You may continue. Have a good trip.
- Heil Hitler.

133
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.500
Heil Hitler.

134
00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.600
Come out.

135
00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.600
Let's go.

136
00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.300
Rachel. Rachel.

137
00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:02.300
Max. That's my little brother.

138
00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:07.400
- We're here too.
- Mum.

139
00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.100
My girl.

140
00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:12.100
Sshh ... Be quiet, come, come

141
00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:17.000
- How did you get here?
- Through him.

142
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
- He said you were going to cross.
- Then we wanted to go too.

143
00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.400
This is Rob, he helped me.

144
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.400
Hi.

145
00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:36.500
Don't push, be careful, go forward.

146
00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:39.800
Come and sit.

147
00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.900
Please, sit.

148
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.100
- Hurry up, boy.
- He's just had an operation.

149
00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:49.300
- 4 days ago.
- I'm sorry, I didn't know.

150
00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:58.300
- Could you throw away the plank?
- You're not joing us?

151
00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:01.700
No, the skipper will take it from here.

152
00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:10.800
Safe travels.

153
00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:14.300
Lady, take that off.
It glows too much in the dark.

154
00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.800
I keep it on even in my sleep.

155
00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.800
Then move up your collar: the Krauts see everything.

156
00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:23.700
Let's go.

157
00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.700
Look: gingerbread. Saved it for a party. 
That means now.

158
00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.500
What happened to you?

159
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:41.000
Acute appendicitis. He almost couldn't join us.

160
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.800
My notary found us a doctor just in time.

161
00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.800
- He operated secretly.
- On the kitchen table.

162
00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.400
Did Mr. Smaal know where you were?

163
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.500
Of course. He gave us the address of the hideout.

164
00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.900
Odd, he kept repeating he didn't know.

165
00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:00.100
No, careful.

166
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.900
- Where was your hideout?
- In the attic of a boring grocer's.

167
00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.700
- A socialist, but still good.
- But Brussels is better.

168
00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.200
- Now, we'll never be separated again, right?
- Right.

169
00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:19.700
- Why are we going east?
- How can you tell?

170
00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.900
I used to be helmsman on a big ship.
Before the war.

171
00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.300
Before the war I was on the Holland-America line. I'm zigzagging

172
00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.900
Excellent.

173
00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:50.900
Get out.
Show me your cargo.

174
00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:05.100
- Open up.
- But she's dead.

175
00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.800
- It's a very bad disease.
- Typhus.

176
00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.800
Open it.

177
00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:29.100
Close it.

178
00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.100
Man, I almost choked.

179
00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:08.100
We never get any complaints.

180
00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.000
At least a centimetre of space.
Look.

181
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
- Can't go any wider, otherwise they'll notice.
- No, I mean in the rain.

182
00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:17.100
I could hardly keep my face still.

183
00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:24.100
Come.

184
00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:27.900
You can clean yourself up over there.

185
00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:32.000
Here, use this.

186
00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:34.800
I don't know how I will ever be able to thank you.

187
00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.800
- You could untie these ...
- Take a hike, Joop.

188
00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:42.100
Instead thank the people who found you

189
00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:45.200
for warning us instead of warning the SD.

190
00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.200
We'll dye that.

191
00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.400
Dad?

192
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.200
Kuipers.

193
00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.000
Ellis de Vries.

194
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
You'll get used to the name.
Do you have a good ID?

195
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000
All fine, dad. More than real.

196
00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:40.500
Yes.

197
00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.500
- Did you ever do any cooking?
- Yes, I used to at home. Kosher.

198
00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:48.100
There's no demand for that anymore.

199
00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:51.400
- Sorry.
- You can stay here,

200
00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.300
but you'll have to work.

201
00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:56.500
The harder, the better.

202
00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:59.500
Her whole family was murdered by the SS.

203
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Someday we'll get back to them, Ellis.

204
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Five Months Later

205
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.400
Ellis, come here.

206
00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.800
We need a substitute.
Could you be a replacement?

207
00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:32.800
- Work is work.
- Even if it's dangerous?

208
00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:35.500
What do I have to lose?

209
00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:38.500
Your life.

210
00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:10.600
- She'll travel with me tomorrow?
- Yes.

211
00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:12.400
The new courier, Ellis

212
00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:13.900
- I am Hans.
- Ellis.

213
00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:15.900
Have a seat.

214
00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:18.900
Ok, everybody knows the procedure:
the Kuipers group handles the technical side ...

215
00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:20.300
- Hello.
- Hello.

216
00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.000
... we as KP will give cover.

217
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.800
- What time will he arrive?
- 7:30

218
00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.700
- Wind direction?
- North-north-west.

219
00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:28.200
Then you'll take the lead, Joop:
south-south-east

220
00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.400
- Red.
- You stay at 200 meters, Kees.

221
00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:33.200
No further: I am not Jesse Owens.

222
00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.200
- Blue, Kees.
- And I give the signs.

223
00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.200
Any further questions?
Then pass on the gin.

224
00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:40.900
And what's my job in this boys club?

225
00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.600
You can play my fiancee.
Just kissing around somewhat.

226
00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.600
You'll be playing a couple.
So the Krauts won't be paying attention.

227
00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.800
Just kissing? That's all?

228
00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:52.200
Boys.

229
00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:55.300
To the Queen.

230
00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.900
To Wilhelmina, Tim.
You old communist.

231
00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:06.100
Cheers.

232
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
One minute to go. Let's begin.

233
00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:41.300
Okay, can you take this?

234
00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.800
Chocolate ... haven't had this for 2 years.

235
00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:05.900
Ellis, you'll be carrying this tomorrow. 
Be careful, there's radio equipment in there.

236
00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.500
Music, nice.
Are we going to swing?

237
00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:11.100
A transmitter/receiver.

238
00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.700
I'm going to plant a microphone in the head office of the SD.

239
00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:16.700
- But that's heavily guarded, right?
- I am a maintenance technician at the phone company.

240
00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.600
The Krauts need us all the time.
I can walk in and out, no problem.

241
00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:23.700
Everything's prepared. 
I was just waiting for this.

242
00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:26.900
- Is my stuff in there too?
- Here.

243
00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:30.500
I can't take this across the street.

244
00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:32.900
'Handle with care' it says.

245
00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:35.900
There's still some suitcases left in the office.

246
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:41.100
Start loading up, guys.

247
00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:49.300
Hands up!
Don't move!

248
00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:21.800
Oh my god, we took 5 lives.
What have we done?

249
00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:24.000
It was them or us, Theo.

250
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000
Let's load up, we have to leave.
I'll check outside.

251
00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:30.300
Goddamn. He's such a cold one, Hans.

252
00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.800
- He's a top marksman.
- And if he had missed?

253
00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.900
He never misses. Hans was the best marksman of Pro Patria.

254
00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:39.800
- What's that?
- A student shooting club.

255
00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.800
THE student marksman club.
Hans, Maarten and I  were members.

256
00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:46.300
And we work together, helping the Jews.

257
00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:48.400
Hans is great, he'll get you through anything.

258
00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:51.500
No Kraut to be seen.
They were working on their own.

259
00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.200
Take off their uniforms.
We can use everything.

260
00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:55.900
We'll have to give them a Christian burial.

261
00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:58.900
Oh yeah?
There are lots of deep holes here, Theo.

262
00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:02.300
You can throw 'em in there by yourself.

263
00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:27.800
That's my gun. What did you think?

264
00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.800
What did you think I was thinking?

265
00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.200
Check. Keep your ID's ready.

266
00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:37.500
We're in love right?

267
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000
Well ... here it goes.

268
00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:54.100
Open all suitcases.

269
00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:59.700
I'll shoot. You pull the emergency brake.
Leave the train and run. Don't think of anything else.

270
00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:04.400
Stay away from me, you dirty bastard!

271
00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.400
[In German]: Good day.

272
00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:30.400
- Can I help you?
- Thank you.

273
00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.000
Heavy, huh?

274
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000
Beautiful ladies should not carry heavy bags.

275
00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:41.300
My records and my phonograph.

276
00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:45.300
- Thank you.
- You like music? 
- Very much

277
00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:48.300
That's my job: I used to be a singer before the war.

278
00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:53.100
- Ellis de Vries.
- Ludwig Mntze

279
00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:00.800
Open your suitcase. Papers.

280
00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.100
Exciting?

281
00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:12.100
Very exciting.
For me that is.

282
00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:17.300
Postage stamps -- I loved those as a child.

283
00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.900
- All those far away countries.
- I've collected them since I was six.

284
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000
Probably why I studied geography.

285
00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:28.700
Inspection.

286
00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:31.700
Can't you see I'm busy?
Move along.

287
00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.400
Yes, Captain.

288
00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:41.100
Can I look?
I'll be very gentle.

289
00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.600
Poland ... France ...

290
00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:52.500
I always collect the countries where I'm stationed.

291
00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:55.500
First Poland, then France, and now here.

292
00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:01.100
You've stopped with our Queen.

293
00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:04.100
The Wilhelmina stamps from the Dutch Indies.

294
00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.600
I don't know if I'll ever get them complete.

295
00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:29.400
Hauptsturmfhrer, over here.

296
00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:33.700
No, these are mine.

297
00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.200
I'd be glad to take you home
so you don't have to carry them.

298
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.400
That's not necessary, I'm being picked up. 
Thank you very much.

299
00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:49.500
Maybe I'll see you around.

300
00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:53.400
I'd like that.
Good bye.

301
00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:15.100
- You flirt very easy.
- Yes, well men ...

302
00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:18.600
Mntze, he's called. Quite a nice guy.

303
00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:21.700
Chief of the SD. Because of him, lots
of people of the resistance have died.

304
00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:25.600
And a man like that collects stamps?

305
00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:28.700
If he ever faces the wall after the war,
I'll be glad to say "Fire".

306
00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:32.300
- Watch out.
- Sorry.

307
00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:51.600
Look, he found something.

308
00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:56.600
Watch it.

309
00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:07.800
Mr. Gerben, it's our car.

310
00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.000
Don't touch that.

311
00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:16.100
- Open up. Open!
- It's jammed.

312
00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:29.300
Jesus.

313
00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:36.800
They've seen the weapons!

314
00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:42.100
- Get out!
- Run!

315
00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:46.200
Stop there!

316
00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:14.900
- Gerben.
- Goddamn it.

317
00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:17.200
Gerben.

318
00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:20.300
- You're too late, they'll get you.
- He's my son.

319
00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:23.400
If they get you, we're all fucked.
You know too much: They'll beat it out of you.

320
00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:26.800
Mr. Kuipers, there's nothing more we can do.

321
00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:46.100
Here, take everything to Silentium.
Ellis, you take the suitcases to the drop point.

322
00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:51.700
Here Hans, call them.
Tell them there's a contamination here.

323
00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:54.800
Thanks to that arse Mntze, they now have Tim.

324
00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:58.700
Wait a minute.

325
00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:01.700
Please tell them the soup kitchen is now closed.

326
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000
You met this Mntze in the train, right?

327
00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:10.500
- And he kinda liked you?
- The bastard adored her.

328
00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:14.500
Oh, don't overreact.

329
00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:17.500
He showed me his stamps. He's collecting Wilhelmina.

330
00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:21.400
[Hans]: The soup kitchen will be closed.

331
00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.000
How far would you be willing to go with him.

332
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.900
How far?

333
00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:30.600
- You mean sleep with him?
- That's a rude way of saying it.

334
00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:33.700
I like things to be clear. Is that what you mean?

335
00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:38.100
How far would you go? For Tim. For the others.

336
00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:49.900
As far as Mntze is willing to go. OK?

337
00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:56.200
A deadly sin: A good suit for a dead body
while everyone else walks in rags.

338
00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:59.000
The customer remains king.
Where did she put the suitcase?

339
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000
Over there, in the office.

340
00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:16.800
You think of everything.
And for that fucking Kraut.

341
00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:19.400
Go away. This is none of you business.

342
00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:22.400
- After the train incident, maybe a little?
- No, not even a little.

343
00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:26.500
Alright. I'm here for the suitcase.

344
00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:29.500
There.

345
00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:38.900
Goddamn. It's soaking wet.

346
00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:41.700
- Has it broken?
- I hope not: it's insulin.

347
00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:44.700
There's a dying need for that.
Imagine a diabetic without his insulin.

348
00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:48.000
- He can say bye bye.
- Tell me about it.

349
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.500
You have it as well? I never noticed.

350
00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:53.300
No I don't. I am healthy.

351
00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:56.300
Stop watching.

352
00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:00.500
At the revue, there was diabetic comedian.
He always injected before a performance.

353
00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:04.400
Then he had to eat a lot of chocolate 
if he injected too much. A never ending bother.

354
00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:07.600
Yes, but still better than dying of pain.

355
00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:10.700
British bastards. At least half of it is broken.

356
00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:14.400
The hospital will be happy with that.

357
00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:18.800
Don't ask. Then I can't give away any secrets.

358
00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:30.300
It stings, doctor.
It stings, it stings, it stings!

359
00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:38.400
Shall the doctor have a look at it?

360
00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:52.800
So I am still the first.

361
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000
Yes?

362
00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:04.300
Wim, the girl is here again.
This time she looks like Jean Harlow.

363
00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:12.400
Rachel, you're back?

364
00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:15.200
We never got any further than the Biesbosch.

365
00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:18.200
And your parents and Max ... they joined you didn't they?

366
00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:21.800
Suddenly there was a Kraut patrol boat and ...

367
00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:27.700
Stupid coincedence

368
00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:38.100
Strange. Everybody's dead and I can't cry for them.

369
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000
- Who fared you over?
- A skipper. Also dead, I think.

370
00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:55.800
But someone brought you to the Biesbosch, right?

371
00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:58.300
A man from the underground.

372
00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:00.300
Who was that?

373
00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:03.300
van Gein, he was called I think.

374
00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:07.700
Disgusting. My sympathies.

375
00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:14.200
I am supposed to work for Queen and country

376
00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:18.200
by getting friendly with a high ranking SD officer.

377
00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:23.000
Maybe even sleep with him.

378
00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:26.100
You're on your own with that.
Can't help you with that.

379
00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:30.400
No.

380
00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:34.700
But maybe there's something in here that can help me.

381
00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:53.200
I am here to see Captain Mntze

382
00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.900
Really? Why?

383
00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:57.900
It's about the royal house.
Queen Wilhelmina in person.

384
00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:08.200
Send her to Captain Mntze

385
00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:26.300
You are expected. Wait over there.

386
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.600
Ms. de Vries ...

387
00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:48.600
What a surprise. To what do I owe the pleasure?

388
00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:52.700
I have family in the dutch Indies.
They always wrote.

389
00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:56.800
My mother kept the letters.
I have softened the stamps off for you.

390
00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:01.300
With steam.

391
00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:04.600
Amazing.

392
00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:10.900
Beautiful, very nice.

393
00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:12.800
Good day.

394
00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:15.900
Put it over there, Ronnie. I don't
want to damage these lovely stamps.

395
00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:19.900
- Shall I serve you?
- No don't bother, I'll do that.

396
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.800
Take some of the chocolate. It's British.

397
00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:30.800
We got them by chance.

398
00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:40.200
Take some.

399
00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:45.000
What were you planning to do with these stamps?

400
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.000
Nothing special, they were in a drawer in my place.

401
00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:52.900
Almost all the Wilhelmina stamps I don't have ...

402
00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:56.100
If you see anything of interest, take it.

403
00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:04.400
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

404
00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:09.100
Yes.

405
00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:13.100
Close the door.

406
00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:16.200
Captain, your car is ready.

407
00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:19.200
Already?
Take my hat and coat please.

408
00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:23.600
Too bad, duty calls.
I haven't been able to choose yet.

409
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.000
Then I'll leave them here.

410
00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:32.800
Thank you.

411
00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:36.400
I think I ate too much chocolate.
Is that bad?

412
00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:38.600
I don't get it everyday.

413
00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:41.600
I have to go to a party.
There will be much more to eat there.

414
00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:45.700
What if you could go home and pick up
your phonograph and records and join me?

415
00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:50.000
How about I sing?

416
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000
Even better.

417
00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:16.900
Without the SD from The Hague.
All our successes would not have been possible.

418
00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:22.900
Your fight against the terrorists is our fight.

419
00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:26.300
With the Fhrer, we fight for a free Europe.

420
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.200
Heil Hitler.

421
00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:38.200
Heil Hitler.

422
00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:42.800
And now music. Franken.

423
00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:53.300
# die Fahne hoch
die Reihen fest sind geschIossen

424
00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:00.600
# SA marschiert
mit ruhig festem Schritt

425
00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:06.700
# Kam'raden, die Rotfront
und Reaktion erschossen

426
00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:14.500
# marschier'n im Geist
in unser'n Reihen mit

427
00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:21.300
# Kam'raden, die Rotfront
und Reaktion erschossen

428
00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:28.300
# marschier'n im Geist
in unser'n Reihen mit

429
00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:50.900
Ms. de Vries?

430
00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:06.300
Everything okay?

431
00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:09.300
The champagne didn't go down well.

432
00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:12.100
I'm not used to any alcohol anymore.

433
00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:15.100
But I'm alright now.

434
00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:22.300
Shall I sing some?

435
00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:29.900
General, ladies and gentlemen ...

436
00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:33.800
It is my great honor to present you Ellis de Vries.

437
00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:38.300
She will sing for us.

438
00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:42.500
Any requests?

439
00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:44.800
Lola. Die fesche Lola.

440
00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:47.800
Yes, Lola, Lola

441
00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:02.100
# ich bin die fesche Lola

442
00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:05.100
# der Liebling der Saison. ich hab'ein
Pianola. zu Haus in mein'm Salon.

443
00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:10.800
# ich bin die fesche Lola
mich liebt ein jeder Mann

444
00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:14.700
# doch an mein Pianola
da lass ich keinen 'ran

445
00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:19.200
Lola, Lola

446
00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:22.500
# ich bin die fesche Lola
der Liebling der Saison

447
00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:26.200
Ich hab'ein
Pianola. zu Haus in mein'm Salon.

448
00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:29.900
# und wer mich will begleiten
da d'runten aus dem Saal

449
00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:33.900
# den hau ich auf der Saiten
und treff'ihn aufs Pedal

450
00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:40.500
Lola.

451
00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:53.600
Bye

452
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.900
So?

453
00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:03.100
So what?

454
00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:06.100
I'd like to see your stamps.

455
00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:11.100
There's quite a lot of them.

456
00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:14.100
I have lots of time.

457
00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:18.900
I don't have any toothbrush for you.

458
00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:32.500
Brushed.

459
00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.400
Not bad.

460
00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:43.500
From the capitalists we kicked out.

461
00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:56.900
The loot is for the winners.

462
00:48:57.500 --> 00:49:00.500
Exactly.

463
00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:13.800
You sing well.
Where did you sing?

464
00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:16.900
In Berlin. Cabaret, revue.

465
00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:21.900
You should have continued.

466
00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:24.900
There's no need for that anymore now.

467
00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:48.100
Your hair is normally black.

468
00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:54.200
Blonde is in fashion now.

469
00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:57.700
Or this fashion will help you survive,
for instance if you're a Jew.

470
00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:09.200
So what?

471
00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:23.400
Are these Jewish?

472
00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:37.600
Are these Jewish?

473
00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:01.400
Also blonde. A perfectionist.

474
00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:46.700
- Oh, sorry. 
- Come on in, girls are allowed.

475
00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:53.600
Do you also have to pee after sex?
You were really great tonight.

476
00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:59.200
Did he hire you, Mntze?
You came looking for a job, right?

477
00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:02.300
No, though I am searching for one.
But I am not a party member

478
00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:06.800
Neither am I, although I do agree with them.

479
00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:10.500
Holland is, after all, a piece of Germany.

480
00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:13.500
We all speak a sort of German dialect.

481
00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:17.600
Oh, nice: real soap.

482
00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:20.600
And good food and great drinks.
What more do you want?

483
00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:22.800
[Franken]: Ronnie?

484
00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:25.500
Make sure a high-ranking Kraut never gets enough of you.

485
00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:28.500
- Gnther, over here.
- Ronnie?

486
00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:34.100
Are you playing with each other?

487
00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:39.500
We were talking about work.
Ellis would like to work for us.

488
00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:42.800
Someone who sings such good german is hired right away.

489
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.000
That is if ...

490
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.000
you pass the inspection.

491
00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:56.400
If that isn't healthy, I don't know what is...

492
00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:04.900
No No! these are reserved for Captain Mntze.

493
00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:41.500
- Where were you?
- On the toilet.

494
00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:45.100
Franken offered me a job.

495
00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:48.100
Good idea. You can start helping with the Fhrer's birthday tomorrow.

496
00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:54.900
You're married, I see.
You have nice kids.

497
00:53:57.100 --> 00:54:00.100
Was. I was married.

498
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:05.000
Not anymore?

499
00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:08.500
No, not anymore.

500
00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:12.000
Gering, had sworn ...

501
00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:15.100
... that no English bomb would fall on Germany.

502
00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:20.600
Christina was with the children in the wrong hideout.

503
00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.000
And I wasn't there.

504
00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:28.200
Bulls eye.

505
00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:36.100
To not have anything, Ellis ... isn't much.

506
00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:42.100
I know.

507
00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:53.700
For you it must be a beautiful sound.

508
00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:59.200
Sshhh ...

509
00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:25.400
You haven't told us anything.

510
00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:28.400
I don't know anything. Someone else put those weapons in the car.

511
00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:40.900
You are just a little piece of shit on our road to final victory.

512
00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:46.200
In a few weeks, the Russians will throw
you in the sea, along with your executioners.

513
00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:51.900
For you.

514
00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:54.800
And for your comrade Stalin.

515
00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:56.600
Dirty bastard.

516
00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:59.600
What a filthy language.

517
00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:03.700
Wash his mouth.

518
00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:22.300
He's holding his breath.

519
00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:37.900
Up

520
00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:43.900
Within the hour you'll talk.

521
00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:54.600
- Are we here alone?
- The rest fled back to Germany.

522
00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:59.600
Could you come and sit here?
So we can sit next to each other.

523
00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:05.800
Type it out and copy it 15 times.

524
00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:08.400
You have spots on your uniform.

525
00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:11.400
It's nothing, just water.
Hurry up, there will be more to do.

526
00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:17.900
If you read, I'll type.

527
00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:20.900
Let's take these off, with them I can't type.

528
00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:29.100
- Are these real?
- Of course, what did you think?

529
00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:32.100
Got it from Gnther. Nice, huh?
His safe is a real treasure hole.

530
00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:36.300
- Open sesame.
- Yes just like that.

531
00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:38.800
There's a whole box full of diamonds.

532
00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:41.600
Right.

533
00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:44.700
Let's see: 1945, 19th.
There we go.

534
00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:53.400
Ellis? You can start.

535
00:57:57.100 --> 00:58:00.100
The terrorist Timotheus Kuipers gave the following ...

536
00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:03.000
You can speed up a little bit.

537
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.700
... statement.

538
00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:08.000
"I am a member of a resistance group.

539
00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:11.100
My father, is head of the group "Gerben Kuipers".

540
00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:16.700
Boring, huh?

541
00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:36.400


542
00:58:57.100 --> 00:59:00.100
Ellis?

543
00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:02.800
What are you doing here?

544
00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:05.600
To talk with the Germans about justice.

545
00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:07.400
Justice? Here?

546
00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:10.400
People of the resistance have no rights, but
as a lawyer I try to help them nonetheless.

547
00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:14.800
With a guy like Franken? A waste of time.

548
00:59:19.700 --> 00:59:22.700
Tim's microphone.

549
00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:28.800
How did you know I was here?

550
00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:31.800
I do not underestimate you.

551
00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:38.500
That Mntze guy is quite nice, don't you think?

552
00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:42.300
Could you give me a hand? We have to
decorate the hallway for the Fhrer's birthday.

553
00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:49.500
Mr. Smaal, you are here.
Come in.

554
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.000
No the piano should go there.

555
00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:00.400
Some more

556
01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:03.500
- Thank you.
- Good bye.

557
01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:06.900
That looks great.

558
01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:10.300
Don't forget to put the Fhrer in the right perspective.

559
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000
- Give me a spotlight.
- Captain.

560
01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:18.300
The execution order for the three terrorists.

561
01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:20.300
Tomorrow we shoot'em. 
Just sign here.

562
01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:23.300
Absolutely not.
No one is getting shot.

563
01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:26.100
But they confessed, they have to be shot.

564
01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:27.800
Fhrer's order, you know that.

565
01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:29.900
I am in command here.

566
01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:32.900
No executions if I say so.
Dismissed.

567
01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:39.500
Heil Hitler.

568
01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:47.500
Jesus, if even those Germans start to
fight among each other, where will it end?

569
01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:54.400
To me! Follow me!

570
01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:51.900
Ellis?

571
01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.000
- Ellis?
- I'm coming

572
01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:11.900
- What are you doing here?
- To cheer him up.

573
01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:19.600
- The nicest one is for you.
- That's sweet. Are you coming with me?

574
01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:25.200
- Actually I have to go home.
- So I won't be seeing you tonight?

575
01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:29.900
Of course you will.
I just have to pick up some clothes.

576
01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:12.200
Oh Honey ...

577
01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:15.200
My little animal.

578
01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:21.400
Animal ... ahh ...

579
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.300
- It works.
- Ellis.

580
01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:30.300
- Ronnie, Ronnie...
- Yes, yes, cum, cum

581
01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:36.500
- Jesus, what a horny animal.
- Just a dirty Kraut whore.

582
01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.800
- We'll get those after the war.
- Shave 'em and put their heads in tar.

583
01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:42.900
- And after that shoot'em.
- Come, don't be so primitive

584
01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:45.400
That's not what we fight for.

585
01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:48.200
Damn, that fucking phone.

586
01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:51.200
Don't stop, keep going.

587
01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:55.200
I almost came. Watch it, you're dripping.

588
01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:59.300
- Franken.
- Yes, send him in.

589
01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:04.100
We'll continue tonight. And now go.

590
01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:07.500
Cas.

591
01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:09.600
- Good day, how are you?
- Fine.

592
01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:12.600
Sit down. I still owe you money from last time.

593
01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:17.600
- What's that?
- He's opening his safe.

594
01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:20.600
There's a new list before you on your desk.

595
01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:23.600
Not many ... is it still worth it?

596
01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:26.000
Easily half a million.

597
01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:29.100
I think this will be the last ride.

598
01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:31.400
- I know that voice.
- Sshhh ...

599
01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:32.700
What?

600
01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:35.700
- It reminds me of the man who helped us flea.
- Shut up.

601
01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:39.200
- Shit, the generator's cutting out.
- I'll fix it.

602
01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:42.300
- You can count it.
- Don't have to.

603
01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:45.900
When can you have the next transport ready?

604
01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:49.100
They live close together. Maybe 3 days?

605
01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:52.100
That's him. That's van Gein.

606
01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:55.400
Those rich Jews always come from the same circles.

607
01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:59.500
None of your business.

608
01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:02.500
If I wanted to, I could find out who your informant is.

609
01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:05.500
This could cost you your head.

610
01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:08.500
Or save mine after the war.

611
01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:12.100
After the war, I won't be here.
Come let's have a drink.

612
01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:16.200
To the next load of stupid Jews.

613
01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:22.200
So it wasn't a coincedence, that German boat.

614
01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:25.700
It was a trap. They're just working on a list.

615
01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:28.100
What list?

616
01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:31.100
Jews with money. They promise to take them to Belgium, 
but instead they kill them.

617
01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:34.600
- How do you know?
- Because I've been set up too!

618
01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:37.900
Because I've seen my whole family being slaughtered.

619
01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:43.100
Jesus, Ellis ... that's horrible.

620
01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:46.500
- Who is this van Gein?
- He poses as someone of the resistance.

621
01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:52.100
He tells Jews that they can run for it,
just make sure to bring your money.

622
01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:56.700
Franken, waits for them, kills them, and then robs them.

623
01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000
So now there's a new list of potential victims.

624
01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:04.000
We cannot let that happen.

625
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000
We don't know who they are or where they are.

626
01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:11.700
- What if we just kill Franken?
- Yes, stop that bastard.

627
01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:14.800
No! If we kill him, 20 to 30 hostages will line up against a wall.

628
01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:17.800
We don't shoot Franken and 20 to 30 jews will be killed.

629
01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:20.800
Is the life of a random Jew worth more than a good Dutchman's?

630
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Who decides that? You?

631
01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:26.800
Franken will not be liquidated.

632
01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:28.900
Van Gein. We kill him and it ends as well.

633
01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:31.900
No killing. Mr. Smaal, your call.

634
01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:36.700
On behalf of Gerben, I am negotiating a truce.

635
01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:39.800
We do no more attacks, and Mntze promises not to retaliate. 
Might work.

636
01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:44.500
Ah, so that's why that fight happened between Franken and Mntze.

637
01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:50.100
Gerben, congratulations. You saved your Tim.

638
01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:52.600
Him AND others. Is that a problem for you?

639
01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:55.500
Me? No. If those are the 'good' Dutchman

640
01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:58.500
That's enough, Ellis. Gerben is chief.
If he says no, than it ends there.

641
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.900
Good day to you.

642
01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:08.900
Ellis.

643
01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:12.300
Things are the way they are.
That microphone of yours is absolutely brilliant.

644
01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:27.600
Ellis.

645
01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:30.600
I agree with you. We can't let those jews be slaughtered.

646
01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:33.700
Gerben is also right. We can't just kill van Gein.

647
01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:38.200
What if he just dissapears?

648
01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:40.700
Franken will know. He'll have people shot.

649
01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:42.900
Or he'll think van Gein has deserted.

650
01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:45.400
After he just promised a new list?

651
01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:48.400
Van Gein is trying to cover upfor after the war, says so himself.

652
01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:51.400
If he disappears, Franken will think he just ran.

653
01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:54.400
There's one thing, Kuipers and Smaal pass by too easily.

654
01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:56.800
Someone has been setting up Jews for a long time.

655
01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:59.600
van Gein has a suspect.
He'll have to tell us.

656
01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:02.700
If I have to I'll beat it out of him. 
Come. I'll round up my boys.

657
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000
I can't. I'm meeting Mntze.

658
01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:12.500
You alone know van Gein's face.
We can't do anything without you

659
01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:16.200
You must be in on it.

660
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.500
That's him.

661
01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:36.500
Let's go.

662
01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:02.500
Give me your shawl.

663
01:09:16.900 --> 01:09:19.900
Now.

664
01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:55.500
It's empty.

665
01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:02.300
Theo.

666
01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:25.600
- Shoot. Shoot.
- I can't.

667
01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:28.600
- Shoot!
- I can't!

668
01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:33.900
Goddamn!

669
01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:36.900
Bitch! Goddamned bitch! I'll goddamn ...

670
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000
You curse.

671
01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:46.200
Blasphemer.

672
01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:49.200
You curse.

673
01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:02.200
That's enough, Theo. Theo, come!

674
01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:11.600
Aah! Be careful man.

675
01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:21.100
Flesh wound, Kees.
You got lucky.

676
01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:24.100
The bullet must come out, though.
Ellis, take the chlorophorm.

677
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Breathe deeply, Kees. Yes, like that.

678
01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:53.900
Oh God, that shit doesn't work, you dick!

679
01:11:55.900 --> 01:11:58.900
Expriry date 1941.
Jesus, this stuff is way over due.

680
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000
- That's why van Gein wasn't knocked out.
- What's still good after 5 years of Krauts?

681
01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:06.800
Your choice: A hit with the hammer, or some booze and bite your teeth.

682
01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:11.100
Booze, dick.

683
01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:15.800
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

684
01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:18.900
Kees, think of something nice.

685
01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:22.800
Okay

686
01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:34.300
Gotcha.

687
01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:36.000
Thanks, dick.

688
01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Guys, cheers on a happy ending.

689
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.900
van Gein delivered the krauts tons.

690
01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:45.900
Tons? You mean millions.

691
01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:48.400
Come on Theo.

692
01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:51.400
Damn those Dutchmen.
They killed my best soldier.

693
01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:56.400
That brave warrior and comrade handed me millions.

694
01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.000
And now he's dead, shot by goddamned terrorists.

695
01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:07.100
I shot a man. I am bad.

696
01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:10.100
That was justice. He's a murderer, you're not.

697
01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:13.700
Yes I am. I am just as bad as the Nazis.

698
01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:22.400
I said no, didn't I? 
I said goddamn NO, didn't I?

699
01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:26.200
The bastard had to die.
Besides, what does it matter?

700
01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:28.800
That Tim, will face the firing squad. Dick.

701
01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:31.800
Along with forty other hostages.

702
01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:36.400
Because you as a resistance hero had to go and shoot van Gein.

703
01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:40.900
Jesus, Gerben. Forty? How do you know?

704
01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:43.900
From the microphone we placed on Franken.

705
01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.000
His best man killed. 
He wants blood.

706
01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:51.800
You still negotiating with Mntze?

707
01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:54.800
Not after the attack you pulled.

708
01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:57.800
Tim is as good as dead.

709
01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:01.100
But your Jews are saved ...

710
01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:05.500
Ellis, no. I am responsible. No one else.

711
01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:09.900
I am turning myself in.
Only I shall face the firing squad. 

712
01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:14.800
I will be beside you, Hans.
I carry most of the guilt.

713
01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:17.800
- I will join too.
- Then we all go.

714
01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:22.700
Stop it, this is ridiculous!
You're all drunk!

715
01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:27.700
Before you know it, all of the resistance
will give up because of gin.

716
01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:30.900
- Turning yourselves in is not a solution.
- Then what is?

717
01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:34.800
Rescue them.

718
01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:37.800
You won't get out alive of the SD basement.

719
01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:43.500
The building plans of the SD office, when it was still a bank.

720
01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:51.100
Got it from a friend.

721
01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:56.700
Here I am.

722
01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:58.400
I thought, "she's not coming back".

723
01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:01.400
I lost track of time at home.

724
01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:05.500
And then it was curfew and I had to sneak my way in.

725
01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:24.700
What do we have here?

726
01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:33.500
How dumb do you think I am?

727
01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:37.700
Suddenly a beautiful woman comes into my life.

728
01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.200
Later she comes to my headquarters...

729
01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:43.200
Then she accidentally has the stamps I'm looking for.

730
01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:47.400
Then she coincidentally appears to be Jewish.

731
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
And as soon as she comes to work here,

732
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.400
Franken's best undercover man gets killed.

733
01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:55.400
Quite a coincedence, don't you think?

734
01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:03.300
Choice: Be silent,

735
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.000
and I will hand you to Franken tomorrow.
Or, you tell me everything now

736
01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:19.100
Only if you put away that gun 

737
01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:26.900
and kiss me now.

738
01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.000
I kissed you, now tell me.

739
01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:55.300
Put away your jackets and get to work.

740
01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:57.600
Call all prisons and ask 

741
01:16:57.700 --> 01:16:59.800
How many hostages they have.

742
01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:02.800
You can stop at 40 pieces, delivery today.

743
01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:06.400
Executions will be tomorrow morning at 06:00.

744
01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:09.400
Those calls will not be necessary.

745
01:17:09.900 --> 01:17:12.900
Lieutenant, open your safe.

746
01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:16.400
Of course. What document
are you looking for?

747
01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:19.400
None. You are under the suspicion of 
robbing and killing rich Jews.

748
01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:21.800
There's nothing against that,

749
01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:24.800
but you are accused of keeping their treasure to yourself.

750
01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:29.300
By not handing over Jewish property to the empire,

751
01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:32.300
you risk court martial and the death penalty.
Open your safe.

752
01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:38.100
At your order, General.

753
01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:57.300
Empty it quickly.

754
01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:16.800
And here?

755
01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:35.500
Open it, please.

756
01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:46.800
From '39, when we started our campaign

757
01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:51.700
Saved it for our victory.

758
01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:55.900
Your Informant seems to have been mistaken.

759
01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:00.100
This person is always well informed.

760
01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:02.800
Not this time.

761
01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:04.800
My apologies, Franken.

762
01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:07.800
This is not the end of this discussion.

763
01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:11.900
General ...

764
01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:18.800
Mntze is negotiating with terrorists.

765
01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:22.200
He promised them no more retaliation.

766
01:19:23.100 --> 01:19:26.100
Even not for the murder of van Gein.

767
01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:33.300
You negotiate?
With terrorists?

768
01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:37.600
The resistance is willing to stop and give in their weapons.

769
01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:41.000
If we stop retaliating.

770
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.000
This is in violation of a Fhrer order of the 4th of September.

771
01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:49.500
- Which stays in force!
- Why shed more blood?

772
01:19:50.100 --> 01:19:53.100
Russians in Berlin -- that Champagne will never be drunk.

773
01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:59.300
That is defeatism.

774
01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:03.100
And negotiating with enemy is high treason.

775
01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:09.500
Police, arrest this man.

776
01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:16.400
This means the death penalty, Mntze.

777
01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:20.400
And I will lead the firing squad.

778
01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:41.900
Ready.

779
01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:48.400
Hans, the papers to get inside.

780
01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:50.400
And the keys?

781
01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:52.600
Duplicates from a contractor for Zutfenaar.

782
01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:55.000
They built the cells.

783
01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000
I let him choose: A bullet now, or a medal after the war.

784
01:20:58.600 --> 01:21:01.600
He gave them gladly.

785
01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:08.300
Gerben, what are you up to?

786
01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:10.300
I will not let you go alone.

787
01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:13.300
- I decide that. You stay here.
- I can't stay here and do nothing.

788
01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:15.900
I'm going to liberate forty men.
It's your job to get them safely out of here.

789
01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:18.900
Everybody has a job, that one is yours.
The keys.

790
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Gerben.

791
01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:32.900
You will get Tim back.
On my word of honour.

792
01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:38.800
- Why aren't you at your station?
- Mntze got arrested.

793
01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:41.500
- Yes, we heard.
- Good, so the krauts are killing themselves.

794
01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:44.500
- Get Mntze out.
- Over my dead body.

795
01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:48.200
Get Mntze out, or I'm out.

796
01:21:50.900 --> 01:21:53.000
That leaves us no choice.

797
01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:56.100
- You really think this highly of this dick?
- Yes, I do.

798
01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:02.700
Good. Take him.

799
01:22:07.900 --> 01:22:10.900
- Hi.
- Hey

800
01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:15.300
Nice, a party.

801
01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:19.300
Mntze being arrested doesn't do you anything?

802
01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:22.800
- Where there is life, there is hope.
- What hope do we have left?

803
01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:26.500
That the Tommys will arrive.

804
01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:29.500
Ellis, we're finished.
We've worked for the krauts.

805
01:22:32.300 --> 01:22:35.300
The families of the poor bastards that 
Franken tortured will come here.

806
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.000
- Or the resistance will kill us.
- The resistance won't kill anyone.

807
01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:44.700
- Like you know.
- Yes, I do.

808
01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:53.100
So you know those guys?

809
01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:57.400
Ellis ... what?

810
01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:00.500
You're a spy.

811
01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:03.500
Jesus. I had never thought you would.

812
01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.000
That's like Mata Hari, with Greta Garbo

813
01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Ladies, you are expected.

814
01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:15.500
You go ahead, I'll join.

815
01:23:18.900 --> 01:23:21.900
That Garbo though ... she died.

816
01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:31.900
Show me your papers.

817
01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:34.300
Hostages and terrorists from Utrecht.

818
01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:37.300

819
01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:40.540

819
01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:40.540

819
01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:40.540

820
01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:40.540

819
01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:40.540

821
01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:40.540

820
01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:40.540

822
01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:40.540
Hostages.

823
01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:45.000
Right.

824
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.300
Move along.

825
01:24:47.300 --> 01:24:50.300
Open up.

826
01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:38.800
You turn the van around.

827
01:25:46.300 --> 01:25:49.300
Follow me.

828
01:25:57.500 --> 01:26:00.500
Guus.

829
01:26:23.700 --> 01:26:26.700
Ellis!

830
01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:39.900
# ja, das ist meine Melodie
nach der ich singen muss

831
01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:43.100
# nach der ich pfeifen muss
und tanzen muss, und springen muss

832
01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:46.200
# die man beim ersten Ton versteht
weil sie jedem in die Beine geht

833
01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:52.100
# ja, das ist eine Melodie
die mich so selig macht

834
01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:55.200
# wenn ich sie hre,
hab ich immer an das GIck gedacht

835
01:26:55.300 --> 01:26:58.300
# ach bitte sagt mir, liebt ihr sie
meine kleine Lieblingsmelodie

836
01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:26.900
Go.

837
01:27:26.900 --> 01:27:29.900
- Mntze too?
- We promised Ellis.

838
01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:35.800
Siem.

839
01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:38.800
Hi, come on.

840
01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:45.200
It's me, Maarten.

841
01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:47.600
Maarten.

842
01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:50.600
Hi Tim old boy.

843
01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.000
# ich tanze mit dir in den Himmel hinein

844
01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:59.400
# in den siebenten Himmel der Liebe

845
01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:07.500
# die Erde versinkt,
und wir zwei sind allein

846
01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:15.000
# in dem siebenten Himmel der Liebe

847
01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:36.200
All together. Chorus.

848
01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:39.300
# ich tanze mit dir in den

849
01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:42.700
# HimmeI hinein
- Boys hurry up.

850
01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.000
What's going on down there?

851
01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Nothing we can't handle.

852
01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:32.800
Guards.

853
01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:48.900
Tim!

854
01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:53.200
- Go!
- Joop.

855
01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:23.000
- What happened?
-Go, now.

856
01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:32.100
Easy.

857
01:30:32.100 --> 01:30:33.600
Hit it.

858
01:30:56.100 --> 01:30:59.100
Ronnie, you help Kutner.
Ellis, come with me to write a report.

859
01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:23.600
And?

860
01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:26.600
A trap. Complete failure.

861
01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:34.300
And Tim?

862
01:31:38.900 --> 01:31:41.900
Oh God.

863
01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:52.100
Have a seat.

864
01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:55.100
Ellis you did a great job. I am
very satisfied.

865
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Well of course, one does
what one can for the Fhrer.

866
01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:07.800
Yes, but the result is above all expectations.

867
01:32:08.700 --> 01:32:11.700
- It can't be true?
- God damn

868
01:32:12.100 --> 01:32:15.100
They've been beautifully set up with that coal hatch.

869
01:32:17.900 --> 01:32:20.900
Like rats in cage.

870
01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:26.200
You earned your money fair and square.

871
01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:29.200
The bitch tricked us.
What a dirty Jewish trick.

872
01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:33.000
- See, you can't trust them.
- Silence.

873
01:32:33.100 --> 01:32:36.100
Himmler can come down now.
You may do that dear.

874
01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.000
We won't be needing this english toy now anymore.

875
01:32:47.300 --> 01:32:50.300
My dear Kuipers, Lieutenant Kuipers,
is saying goodbye to you now.

876
01:32:52.100 --> 01:32:55.100
Ellis, one last word?

877
01:32:57.800 --> 01:33:00.800
She laughs.
That bitch laughs.

878
01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:04.200
Good night and good watch.
Thank you for your cooperation.

879
01:33:21.900 --> 01:33:24.900
Never bite more than you can chew, darling.

880
01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:28.900
Tomorrow, firing squad, along side with your Mntze.

881
01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:41.500
Even if it's the last thing I can do: that girl dies.

882
01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:45.400
How can she do that as a Jew?

883
01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:48.500
- Who knows how much pressure she was under.
- Still ...

884
01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:51.900
What if you had to chose between a bullet or treason.

885
01:33:52.700 --> 01:33:55.700
An explanation is not an excuse.
We kill the girl, no matter what.

886
01:33:57.700 --> 01:34:00.700
Wherever, whenever.

887
01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:08.600
Move along.

888
01:34:48.900 --> 01:34:51.900
Empty, empty.

889
01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:57.800
Here, come here.

890
01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:03.500
Oh, no my beautiful dress.
Quick, a hanky.

891
01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:14.500
That tickles.

892
01:35:26.100 --> 01:35:29.100
That tickles.

893
01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:16.100
Sshhh ...

894
01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:19.800
Come.

895
01:36:33.300 --> 01:36:36.300
Give me the gun.

896
01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:50.600
Franken will never catch us alive. Never.

897
01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:00.600
Move along

898
01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:03.500
Come, hurry up.

899
01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:06.500
Everything in order again, Siegfried?

900
01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:12.300
Move along.

901
01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:15.300
- Make way!
- Not very friendly today are we?

902
01:37:37.300 --> 01:37:39.900
Very diligent.
I'd never have thought.

903
01:37:39.900 --> 01:37:42.900
Here you lazy, dry these.

904
01:37:46.300 --> 01:37:49.300
Cosy, huh?

905
01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:53.100
I wish it could stay like this forever.

906
01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:56.100
It can, if we stay together.

907
01:37:56.300 --> 01:37:59.300
Forever.

908
01:38:03.900 --> 01:38:06.300
But not here in Holland.

909
01:38:06.300 --> 01:38:09.300
They'll think I am a traitor.
They will look for me.

910
01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:12.500
We'll have to straighten that out.
We know what the treason was like.

911
01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:16.400
Optimist. Do you really think they'll
let you finish your talk as an SD officer?

912
01:38:18.700 --> 01:38:21.700
We have no other choice.

913
01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:29.000
We interrupt this program for the following announcement:

914
01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:33.600
[Radio]: The German command has agreed to surrender ...

915
01:38:34.100 --> 01:38:37.100
... of all german armed forces in Holland, the
north west of Germany and Denmark...

916
01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:42.700
... to the commander in chief of the 21st army.

917
01:38:42.700 --> 01:38:44.900
The war is over, my love.
The war is gone.

918
01:38:44.900 --> 01:38:47.900
[Radio]: This includes all the marine vessels.

919
01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:52.100
For us it is merely starting.

920
01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:55.500
I'd never thought to be afraid of liberation.

921
01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:21.600
Lieutenant Franken.

922
01:39:37.100 --> 01:39:40.100
Lieutenant

923
01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:46.800
Ropes away.

924
01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:14.600
- Did you set course?
- Yes.

925
01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:17.600
- In six hours, we'll be in Hamburg.
- Very good

926
01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Have a look down below.

927
01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:46.900
Joseph, what's wrong.

928
01:40:46.900 --> 01:40:49.900
Joseph?

929
01:40:57.700 --> 01:40:59.700
Joseph?

930
01:41:17.300 --> 01:41:20.000
Did your really think we'd let you get away?

931
01:41:20.100 --> 01:41:23.100
- What are you doing here?
- You. And your treasure.

932
01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.500
Ellis.

933
01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:02.200
Ellis.

934
01:42:02.300 --> 01:42:04.400
Ellis.

935
01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:07.400
Ellis. Here, on the jeep.

936
01:42:11.700 --> 01:42:14.100
- Ronnie.
- Hi, Ellis. Join us.

937
01:42:14.100 --> 01:42:16.500
- How did you get here?
- Just stand in front.

938
01:42:16.500 --> 01:42:18.400
A bit of laughing and pushing around.

939
01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:21.400
Look, my new boyfriend. He has everything a girl wants.

940
01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Nylons, and stockings, and chocolate, and whiskey.
Oh, I love him!

941
01:42:26.100 --> 01:42:29.100
- Come ride with me.
- No, I don't have time.

942
01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:32.300
Ok, see you soon.

943
01:42:32.300 --> 01:42:35.300
Bye. Bye.

944
01:42:32.300 --> 01:42:35.300
[Sign]: Traitor

945
01:42:32.300 --> 01:42:35.300
[Sign]: Whore

946
01:43:12.100 --> 01:43:14.500
One moment, we're coming.

947
01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:17.500
Come, Wim. The Canadians are here.

948
01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:24.500
No. You're still alive?

949
01:43:24.500 --> 01:43:27.500
Yes, strange huh, with all those people trying to kill us.

950
01:43:28.300 --> 01:43:30.400
I thought Franken had shot you ...

951
01:43:30.500 --> 01:43:33.200
Surely he told you we got away?

952
01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:36.200
Franken? 
Tell me? Me?

953
01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:39.400
We've been in hiding for weeks. 
We just got home half an hour ago.

954
01:43:39.700 --> 01:43:42.700
- Who says you are not trying to leave?
- What do you mean child?

955
01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:46.600
I am about to be picked up by Canadian field security

956
01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:50.200
Good, then we'll join you.

957
01:43:50.500 --> 01:43:53.500
- We'll wait in your office.
- Ludwig, what's wrong with you?

958
01:43:53.900 --> 01:43:56.600
Go inside!

959
01:43:56.600 --> 01:43:59.600
Sit down.

960
01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:07.600
So you think I'm guilty for the disastrous attack?

961
01:44:08.300 --> 01:44:11.300
Yes and for the eradication of your Jewish clients.

962
01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:14.400
How dare you! Most of them knew him for years. 
They were friends.

963
01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
What would be my gain?

964
01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.900
By stealing of what they entrusted you with.
You and Franken.

965
01:44:20.900 --> 01:44:22.400
You betrayed him where the microphone was.

966
01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:24.600
The hold up was your idea.

967
01:44:24.700 --> 01:44:26.200
You let Hans and his men get slaughtered.

968
01:44:26.300 --> 01:44:27.900
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

969
01:44:27.900 --> 01:44:30.800
I wasn't the only one.
Kuipers knew all this as well.

970
01:44:30.900 --> 01:44:33.900
But nobody would have his own son killed

971
01:44:33.900 --> 01:44:36.900
Every man has unknown deapths.

972
01:44:38.700 --> 01:44:41.700
May I show you something?

973
01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:46.400
While we were in hiding, my wife and I 
tried to put things in perspective.

974
01:44:47.700 --> 01:44:50.400
I examined my agenda.

975
01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:53.400
And we came to a radical conclusion,
didn't we darling?

976
01:44:54.900 --> 01:44:56.600
And that is?

977
01:44:56.700 --> 01:44:59.700
You'll have to join us by going to the Canadian police.

978
01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:02.300
Just tell me.

979
01:45:02.300 --> 01:45:05.000
As a lawyer, I can't.

980
01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:08.000
I have to keep you unprejudiced.

981
01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:11.000
That will be the Canadians.

982
01:45:12.300 --> 01:45:15.300
Every suspect deserves a fair trial.

983
01:45:16.300 --> 01:45:19.100
Even the biggest bastard?

984
01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:22.100
Even those.

985
01:45:25.300 --> 01:45:28.100
- We're coming.
- You?

986
01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:33.500
Wim?

987
01:45:33.500 --> 01:45:36.500
Wim?

988
01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:45.600
Stay here.

989
01:46:16.500 --> 01:46:19.500
- Look!
- Goddamn, that's Mntze! Get him!

990
01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:33.200
Mntze, we've got Mntze!

991
01:46:35.100 --> 01:46:38.100
We have Mntze!

992
01:46:38.900 --> 01:46:41.900
Yes!

993
01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:50.100
Goddamn. There's Ellis de Vries.
Come with me.

994
01:46:52.500 --> 01:46:55.500
Ellis de Vries.

995
01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:05.400
Over here.

996
01:47:14.700 --> 01:47:17.700
I've got you, bitch.

997
01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:34.700
Attention.

998
01:50:34.700 --> 01:50:37.700
Aim.

999
01:50:41.900 --> 01:50:44.900
Fire.

1000
01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:52.600
Get up, you're going to church.

1001
01:50:53.800 --> 01:50:56.800
Come on, bring your shit buckets.

1002
01:50:57.600 --> 01:51:00.600
- Go on, move.
- Church is up stairs.

1003
01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:04.000
Come on.

1004
01:51:07.300 --> 01:51:10.300
Hey bitch, shit is over there.

1005
01:51:11.300 --> 01:51:14.300
- Move along.
- You pull it up. Hurry up.

1006
01:51:18.500 --> 01:51:21.500
Listen ot the voice of God.
Maybe you can change your ways.

1007
01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:25.500
Look ahead.

1008
01:51:25.500 --> 01:51:28.500
# 't scheepke onder Jezus' hoede

1009
01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:33.800
# met zijn kruisvlag hoog in top

1010
01:51:35.900 --> 01:51:38.900
# neemt aIs arke der verlossing

1011
01:51:40.700 --> 01:51:43.700
# aIIen die in nood zijn op

1012
01:51:46.900 --> 01:51:49.400
Hey, silence.

1013
01:51:49.400 --> 01:51:52.400
Silence.

1014
01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:57.000
We come to see traitors.
Heads up, let me see your faces.

1015
01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:02.000
- Look at them.
- Dirty rotten heads.

1016
01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:05.000
- Maybe the rest has some to offer.
- Take off your clothes.

1017
01:52:06.300 --> 01:52:09.000
- Guys take off your pants.
- Bare ass.

1018
01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:12.000
All women naked on top, I wanna see some tits.

1019
01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:15.200
Yes.

1020
01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:20.500
This too.

1021
01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:24.600
Take it off.

1022
01:52:26.300 --> 01:52:28.400
She sang for the Krauts.

1023
01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:30.300
She'll certainly sing for us.

1024
01:52:30.300 --> 01:52:33.300
- Sing for you? Never.
- Of course you do. Everybody sings.

1025
01:52:35.800 --> 01:52:38.800
Sing.

1026
01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:42.000
Are you mocking me?

1027
01:52:42.700 --> 01:52:44.800
Do you want me to lose face?

1028
01:52:44.800 --> 01:52:47.800
No way. Dirty Kraut bitch.
Dirty whore.

1029
01:52:48.500 --> 01:52:51.500
Hit her. Hit her.

1030
01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Take cover, move away from the girl.

1031
01:53:18.900 --> 01:53:21.900
Damn, it stinks.

1032
01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
Who's got some perfume?

1033
01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Stinky slut. Dirty stinky slut.

1034
01:53:29.100 --> 01:53:32.100
Make way for the fireman.

1035
01:53:41.400 --> 01:53:44.400
Stay away from my hose.

1036
01:53:46.500 --> 01:53:49.200
- Roll it up.
- Soldiers have no say down here.

1037
01:53:49.300 --> 01:53:52.300
I'm the boss here.

1038
01:53:58.300 --> 01:54:01.200
I am Commander Akkermans of the Prince's staff.

1039
01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:03.800
This is a godforesaken scandal!

1040
01:54:15.200 --> 01:54:18.200
Dirty fascists, you'll be out of here within

1041
01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:22.200
And you punks up there, get out of here now!

1042
01:54:31.900 --> 01:54:34.900
Ellis it's over. Come.
It's over. Come.

1043
01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:40.700
I want to leave.

1044
01:54:40.700 --> 01:54:43.700
Come honey. It's over.

1045
01:54:50.100 --> 01:54:53.100
Just a moment, Mrs. de Vries.
Your personal belongings.

1046
01:54:54.600 --> 01:54:57.600
Could you check?

1047
01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:06.000
van Smaal?

1048
01:55:10.500 --> 01:55:13.500
There goes the doctor.
That's doctor Akkermans.

1049
01:55:14.300 --> 01:55:17.300
He was in the resistance.
Long live the doctor!

1050
01:55:19.100 --> 01:55:20.900
Chocolate. Chocolate.

1051
01:55:20.900 --> 01:55:23.900
Here, don't give it all.
Supplies are still scarce.

1052
01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:43.300
# oranje boven, oranje boven
leve de koningin

1053
01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:51.600
I want to show you something.

1054
01:55:59.100 --> 01:56:02.100
- How did you get it?
- Franken tried to get away with it.

1055
01:56:04.300 --> 01:56:07.300
Everything he robbed from the murdered Jews.

1056
01:56:11.900 --> 01:56:14.900
I got this from my father, for my first performance.

1057
01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:21.400
That bastard Franken tried to make you into an accomplice, huh?

1058
01:56:23.700 --> 01:56:26.700
I'll talk to Kuipers about that.
Or higher up with the Prince.

1059
01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:30.800
I'll explain.

1060
01:56:30.900 --> 01:56:32.500
They'll never believe you.

1061
01:56:32.500 --> 01:56:35.500
Everything will be alright.
A happy end. A drink?

1062
01:56:38.700 --> 01:56:41.700
One more thing: Mntze got caught. I want to see him.

1063
01:56:43.700 --> 01:56:46.700
- Haven't you heard?
- What?

1064
01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:51.200
- It's too insane for words.
- What happened?

1065
01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:54.600
A Canadian dick allowed ...

1066
01:56:57.700 --> 01:57:00.700
... the Krauts to carry out the death sentence.

1067
01:57:23.100 --> 01:57:26.100
Doesn't it ever stop?

1068
01:57:32.300 --> 01:57:35.300
Ellis?

1069
01:58:03.800 --> 01:58:06.800
This will calm you down.

1070
01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:14.100
Come, lie down.

1071
01:58:36.100 --> 01:58:39.100
Feeling better?

1072
01:58:40.700 --> 01:58:43.700
Doctor, Doctor!

1073
01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:12.000
Insulin. Too much insulin.

1074
01:59:13.800 --> 01:59:16.800
That will put you to sleep. Forever.

1075
01:59:33.800 --> 01:59:36.800
Doctor Akkermans, Doctor Akkermans!

1076
01:59:37.500 --> 01:59:40.200
The 'hero' has to show himself.

1077
01:59:40.300 --> 01:59:43.300
Stay there. Soon you'll see your family again.

1078
01:59:45.700 --> 01:59:48.700
And who knows, maybe Mntze, too.

1079
01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:54.200
Doctor, Doctor!

1080
02:00:14.500 --> 02:00:17.500
(Anthem:)# Wilhelmus van Nassouwe
ben ik van Duitsen bloed

1081
02:00:20.100 --> 02:00:23.100
# den vaderland getrouwe

1082
02:00:23.900 --> 02:00:26.900
# blijf ik tot in den dood

1083
02:00:28.500 --> 02:00:31.500
# een prinse van Oranje

1084
02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:36.600
# ben ik vrij onverveerd.

02:00:37.800 --> 02:00:40.800
# de koning van Hispanje

1086
02:00:42.900 --> 02:00:45.900
# heb ik aItijd geerd

1087
02:01:04.600 --> 02:01:07.600
Stop her.

1088
02:01:07.700 --> 02:01:10.700
She's a patient, she's ill.
Stop her.

1089
02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:20.000
Ellis. Ellis.

1090
02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:23.800
Out of my way.

1091
02:01:23.800 --> 02:01:26.800
Stop her. She's dangerous.

1092
02:01:28.300 --> 02:01:30.000
Let me go.

1093
02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.700
Stop her. She's dangerous.

1094
02:01:32.700 --> 02:01:35.700
Let me go!
Goddamnit, let me go!

1095
02:01:35.800 --> 02:01:38.800
I'll get you, you whore!

1096
02:01:39.300 --> 02:01:42.300
Let me go, bastards, let me go!

1097
02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:05.200
Golden ring, number 23.

1098
02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:12.800
We found him.

1099
02:02:13.300 --> 02:02:16.300
Gerben, I think you'd better go.

1100
02:02:39.800 --> 02:02:42.800
Can our own people do this?
I don't want the Krauts to touch him.

1101
02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:47.400
You, stop.

1102
02:02:48.100 --> 02:02:51.100
Guys take over, it's for Gerben.

1103
02:03:04.500 --> 02:03:07.500
Mr. Kuipers? A lady wants to speak to you.
Ellis de Vries?

1104
02:03:10.500 --> 02:03:13.500
Wait Mr Kuipers.
Calm down please, Mr Kuipers.

1105
02:03:15.500 --> 02:03:18.000
She has information, names.

1106
02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:21.000
About these dead people, including your son.

1107
02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:24.400
Will you listen to her?

1108
02:03:24.700 --> 02:03:26.300
Yes.

1109
02:03:26.300 --> 02:03:29.300
Ellis?

1110
02:03:38.300 --> 02:03:41.300
Do you know who this is?

1111
02:03:41.500 --> 02:03:44.500
- What do you have to say about it?
- This.

1112
02:03:44.700 --> 02:03:47.700
This says it all.

1113
02:03:47.900 --> 02:03:50.900
From '42 onwards Hans and his friends
helped Jews to find shelter.
 

1114
02:03:52.100 --> 02:03:54.000
Usually his own patients.

1115
02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:57.000
And clients of Maarten, the banker.
And Kees, who was a lawyer.

1116
02:03:57.300 --> 02:04:00.300
Hans knew how much money they had
and where they were hiding.

1117
02:04:00.900 --> 02:04:03.900
Lookat the names Smaal wrote down:
Weiszman, Goud, van Witsen.

1118
02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:09.400
All those men came to him with their
money in order to flea to Belgium.

1119
02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:16.000
Lured to the Biesbosch and then murdered and robbed.

1120
02:04:16.100 --> 02:04:19.100
- Here, my parents.
- Were they patients of Hans?

1121
02:04:19.900 --> 02:04:22.800
No, but my brother got an acute appendix problem.

1122
02:04:22.900 --> 02:04:25.000
They asked Smaal for help,
who sent in Doc Hans.

1123
02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.300
It says here: "Dr. A. visits Stein."

1124
02:04:32.400 --> 02:04:34.800
Then he called Franken and turned them in.

1125
02:04:34.900 --> 02:04:37.900
Franken had van Gein turn up and two days later they were dead.

1126
02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:42.300
I don't understand. Hans ...

1127
02:04:42.300 --> 02:04:45.300
- Did you know he got arrested last year?
- No?

1128
02:04:58.900 --> 02:05:01.900
Dr. A. got out due to lack of proof.

1129
02:05:07.300 --> 02:05:10.300
The bastard.

1130
02:05:10.600 --> 02:05:13.600
- He had his own people killed.
- Kees, Maarten, everyone.

1131
02:05:13.600 --> 02:05:16.600
So no one could ask where their Jewish clients were.

1132
02:05:28.800 --> 02:05:31.500
Gerben?

1133
02:05:31.500 --> 02:05:34.500
Yes.

1134
02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:49.000
Captain ... I'll stay with Gerben.

1135
02:06:17.900 --> 02:06:20.900
# oranje boven
oranje boven, leve de koningin

1136
02:06:38.800 --> 02:06:41.800
Look. That's Hans' Jeep.

1137
02:06:55.700 --> 02:06:57.600
The hearse is gone.

1138
02:06:57.600 --> 02:07:00.600
- He's trying to sneak away.
- Where can he go?

1139
02:07:01.700 --> 02:07:04.700
Belgium, I think. But the Captain said 
they're checking all the road blocks.

1140
02:07:06.100 --> 02:07:09.100
You drive.

1141
02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:15.000
I'll call Field Security.

1142
02:07:24.900 --> 02:07:27.900
A hearse has been seen near a blockade 
in the direction of Hollands Diep.

1143
02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:34.200
Here, turn right.

1144
02:07:57.300 --> 02:07:59.900
- Papers.
- But I've just been checked.

1145
02:07:59.900 --> 02:08:02.900
Let go.

1146
02:08:04.600 --> 02:08:07.600
Let go.

1147
02:08:10.200 --> 02:08:11.700
Willi?

1148
02:08:11.700 --> 02:08:14.600
- Quick, to the back.
- Willi, what's happening?

1149
02:08:14.700 --> 02:08:17.000
What's happening, goddammit?

1150
02:08:17.100 --> 02:08:20.100
Who are you? Ellis?
Ellis, is that you?

1151
02:08:20.900 --> 02:08:22.700
Don't do it. Goddammit.

1152
02:08:22.700 --> 02:08:25.700
Goddammit, let me out. Ellis?

1153
02:08:25.700 --> 02:08:28.700
Ellis, please don't. Ellis.

1154
02:08:28.900 --> 02:08:31.900
Let me out, Ellis, please.
We can talk about this.

1155
02:08:45.700 --> 02:08:48.100
Ellis, look.

1156
02:08:48.100 --> 02:08:51.100
All for you. Jewelry. I've got more. Jewels, gold.

1157
02:08:53.700 --> 02:08:56.700
American dollars. Take them.

1158
02:08:58.400 --> 02:09:01.400
Just open the coffin, Ellis.

1159
02:09:01.500 --> 02:09:04.400
What are you doing?

1160
02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:07.400
Ellis? Goddammit.

1161
02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:11.000
Ellis, what are you doing?

1162
02:09:11.800 --> 02:09:14.800
What are you doing? Ellis?

1163
02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:21.000
Ellis? Don't goddammit, Ellis.

1164
02:09:23.200 --> 02:09:25.800
Don't. I have nothing to do with this.

1165
02:09:25.900 --> 02:09:28.900
Open it. Goddammit.
Let me out. Goddammit!

1166
02:09:30.900 --> 02:09:33.900
I want to ... don't ... Don't!

1167
02:09:38.100 --> 02:09:40.300
Goddammit!

1168
02:09:40.300 --> 02:09:43.300
Goddammit.

1169
02:09:44.900 --> 02:09:47.100
Ellis? Don't

1170
02:09:47.100 --> 02:09:50.100
Don't Ellis! 

1171
02:09:51.100 --> 02:09:54.100
Let me explain, honey.

1172
02:09:54.700 --> 02:09:57.200
Let me...

1173
02:09:57.300 --> 02:10:00.300
Goddammit. You dirty whore.

1174
02:10:01.500 --> 02:10:04.400
I'm going to get you, bitch.
Dirty Kraut whore.

1175
02:10:04.400 --> 02:10:07.400
I'm going to get you! 
You're going to die!

1176
02:10:49.300 --> 02:10:52.300
We should be opening his coffin by now.

1177
02:10:56.800 --> 02:10:59.800
Yeah, we should.

1178
02:11:04.200 --> 02:11:07.200
What do we do with the money?

1179
02:11:07.300 --> 02:11:10.300
- It's not ours.
- It's nobody's.

1180
02:11:13.300 --> 02:11:16.300
It belongs to the dead.

1181
02:11:27.800 --> 02:11:30.800
He's silent now. At last.

1182
02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:37.000
Seemed like an eternity.

1183
02:11:57.600 --> 02:12:00.600
Mummy!

1184
02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:10.000
Hi, sweethearts.

1185
02:12:10.500 --> 02:12:13.500
- Where were you?
- I was here.

1186
02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:17.000
- What were you thinking about?
- About the past ...
