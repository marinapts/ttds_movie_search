1
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58,767
There are some fish
that cannot be caught.

2
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:03,689
It's not that they're faster
or stronger than other fish.

3
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:07,276
They're just touched
by something extra.

4
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:11,321
One such fish was The Beast.

5
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:16,660
And by the time I was born
he was already a legend.

6
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,623
He'd passed up more $ 100 lures
than any fish in Alabama.

7
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,586
Some said that fish was
the ghost of a thief...

8
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,006
...who'd drowned in that river
60 years before.

9
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:35,387
Others claimed he was a dinosaur
left over from the "Cruaceous" Period.

10
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:39,516
I didn't put any stock into
such speculation or superstition.

11
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:42,436
All I knew was I'd been trying
to catch that fish...

12
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:45,272
...since I was a boy
no bigger than you.

13
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,192
And on the day you were born...

14
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:51,153
Well, that was the day
I finally caught him.

15
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:54,698
Now, I'd tried everything on it:

16
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:58,827
Worms, lures, peanut butter,
peanut butter and cheese.

17
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:01,663
But on that day I had a revelation:

18
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:06,543
If that fish was Henry Walls' ghost,
then the usual bait wasn't gonna work.

19
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:11,340
I was gonna have to use something
he truly desired.

20
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:14,718
- Your finger?
- Gold.

21
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:18,388
Now, I tied my ring onto
the strongest line they made...

22
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:23,560
...strong enough to hold up a bridge,
they said, if only for a few minutes.

23
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:26,855
And then I cast upriver.

24
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:34,363
The Beast jumped up and grabbed it
before it even hit the water.

25
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:39,284
And just as fast,
he snapped clean through that line.

26
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:40,786
Well, you can see my predicament.

27
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:45,207
My wedding ring,
the symbol of fidelity to my wife...

28
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:47,793
...soon to be mother of my child...
- Make him stop.

29
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:50,671
...was now lost in the gut
of an uncatchable fish.

30
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:52,589
What did you do?

31
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:56,426
I followed that fish upriver
and downriver.

32
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:00,556
This fish, The Beast...

33
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:06,687
...the whole time we were calling it
a him, when in fact it was a her.

34
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,189
It was fat with eggs
it was gonna lay any day.

35
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:11,775
Now, I was in a situation.

36
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:15,737
I could gut that fish
and get my wedding ring back...

37
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,243
...but in doing so I'd be killing the
smartest catfish in the Ashton River.

38
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:23,579
Did I want to deprive
my son the chance...

39
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:26,790
...to catch a fish like this
of his own?

40
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,626
This ladyfish and I...

41
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:34,339
- Well, we had the same destiny.
- "We were part of the same equation."

42
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:37,342
Now, you may well ask...

43
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:41,555
Oh, darling, darling,
it's still your night.

44
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:47,686
...why did it strike so quick on gold
when nothing else would attract it?

45
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:50,898
That was the lesson
I learned that day...

46
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:53,817
...the day my son was born.

47
00:03:54,318 --> 00:04:00,324
Sometimes the only way to catch
an uncatchable woman...

48
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:03,744
...is to offer her a wedding ring.

49
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:15,088
What, a father's not allowed
to talk about his son?

50
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:17,174
I'm a footnote in that story, Dad...

51
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:23,430
...the context for your great adventure,
which never happened, incidentally.

52
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:26,433
You were selling novelty products
in Wichita when I was born.

53
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,478
Come on, Will.
Everyone loves that story!

54
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:33,649
They don't. I don't love that story. Not
anymore. Not after a thousand times!

55
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:37,778
I know every punch line, Dad.
I can tell them as well as you can!

56
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:41,448
For one night,
one night in your entire life...

57
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,952
...the universe did not revolve
around Edward Bloom.

58
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:49,373
- How can you not understand that?
- I'm sorry to embarrass you.

59
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:53,252
You're embarrassing yourself, Dad.
You just don't see it.

60
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:59,383
After that night, I didn't speak
to my father again for three years.

61
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:08,851
William Bloom, United Press
International. If I could just...

62
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,649
We communicated indirectly, I guess.

63
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:19,361
In her letters and Christmas cards,
my mother wrote for both of them.

64
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:24,825
And when I'd call, she'd say Dad was
out driving or swimming in the pool.

65
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:27,911
True to form, we never
talked about not talking.

66
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:34,626
The truth is, I didn't see anything
of myself in my father.

67
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:38,172
And I don't think he saw anything
of himself in me.

68
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:46,054
We were like strangers
who knew each other very well.

69
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:52,686
In telling the story
of my father's life...

70
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:57,482
...it's impossible to separate fact
from fiction, the man from the myth.

71
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,947
The best I can do
is to tell it the way he told me.

72
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:09,703
It doesn't always make sense,
and most of it never happened.

73
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,980
Give me back my ring!

74
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:50,911
Thank you!

75
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:54,623
But that's what kind of story this is.

76
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:06,718
His birth would set the pace
for his unlikely life.

77
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,013
No longer than most men's,
but larger.

78
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,474
And as strange as his stories got...

79
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:15,936
...the endings were always
the most surprising of all.

80
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,841
Yes. Yes, he's here.

81
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,343
It's your mother.

82
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:57,978
And what does Dr. Bennett say?

83
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:01,440
No, sure, I'll talk to him.

84
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:04,526
Yeah, I'll wait.

85
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,653
It's bad?

86
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:10,616
Yeah, it's more than they thought.
They're gonna stop chemo.

87
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:14,286
- You need to go.
- Probably tonight.

88
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:18,665
- I'm going with you.
- No, no, no. You shouldn't.

89
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,876
I'm going with you.

90
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,949
Now, which one's it gonna be?

91
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,993
"Monkey in a Barn,"
or "Dog in the Road"?

92
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:56,036
The one about the witch.

93
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:56,995
The one about the witch.

94
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:04,253
- You get nightmares.
- But I'm not scared.

95
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,715
Well, neither was I, at first.

96
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:12,052
Now, this took place
in the swamp outside of Ashton.

97
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:16,807
Children weren't allowed in the swamp
on account of the snakes, spiders...

98
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:21,770
...and quicksand that would swallow
you up before you could even scream.

99
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:24,273
There were five of us
out there that night:

100
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:27,943
Me, Ruthie, Wilbur Freely...

101
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:31,822
...and the Price Brothers,
Don and Zacky.

102
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:35,951
And not one of us knew
what was in store.

103
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,789
It's common knowledge that most
towns of a certain size have a witch...

104
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,292
...if only to eat
misbehaving children...

105
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:46,628
...and the occasional puppy
who wanders into her yard.

106
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,756
Witches use those bones
to cast spells and curses...

107
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:52,676
...and make the land infertile.

108
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:56,763
- Is it true she got a glass eye?
- I heard she got it from gypsies.

109
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,807
- What's a gypsy?
- Your momma's a gypsy.

110
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:00,601
Your momma's a bitch.

111
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:02,853
You shouldn't swear.
There's ladies present.

112
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:04,354
- Shit.
- Damn.

113
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:05,689
Screw.

114
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:07,733
Turn off your flashlights.
She'll see you!

115
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:10,861
Yet of all the witches in Alabama...

116
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:13,614
...there was one who was said
to be the most feared.

117
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:17,743
For she had one glass eye which
was said to contain mystical powers.

118
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:22,039
I heard if you look right at it,
you'll see how you're gonna die.

119
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:25,918
That's bull-S-H-l-T, that is.
She's not even a real witch.

120
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,253
If you're so sure, go get that eye.

121
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:32,841
I heard she keeps it in a box on her
night table. Or are you too scared?

122
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:35,344
I'll go in right now and get that eye.

123
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,846
- Then do it.
- Fine, I will.

124
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:40,641
- Fine, you do it.
- Fine, I'm doing it.

125
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:42,893
Edward, don't!

126
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:47,189
She'll make soap out of you.
That's what she does.

127
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:49,900
She makes soap out of people.

128
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:42,035
Ma'am, my name is Edward Bloom...

129
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:44,955
...and there's some folks
like to see your eye.

130
00:11:58,302 --> 00:12:00,262
- You get The Eye?
- I brought it.

131
00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:01,388
Let's see it.

132
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:09,188
Whoa, help!

133
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:22,993
I saw how I was gonna die.
I was old and I fell.

134
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:26,163
I wasn't old at all.

135
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:37,132
I was thinking about death and all.
About seeing how you're gonna die.

136
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:41,178
I mean, on one hand,
if dying was all you thought about...

137
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:43,096
...it could kind of screw you up.

138
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:47,100
But it could kind of help you,
couldn't it?

139
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:51,396
Because, everything else,
you'd know you could survive.

140
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:56,902
I guess I'm saying I'd like to know.

141
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:10,874
That's how I go.

142
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:34,481
Hi, Mom.

143
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:45,492
- Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
- Yes. He's up with your father now.

144
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:49,288
- And how is he?
- Well... No, I got it.

145
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:53,417
He's impossible. He won't eat.
Because he doesn't eat, he's weaker.

146
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,961
Because he's weak,
he doesn't want to eat.

147
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:00,799
- How much time does he have left?
- You don't talk about that.

148
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:03,927
Not yet.

149
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:06,013
Will.

150
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,933
Dr. Bennett. Oh, it's good to see you.

151
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:13,729
My wife, Josephine.

152
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,189
A pleasure.

153
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,401
- You're seven months.
- To the day!

154
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:22,613
It's a boy.

155
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:31,079
Try to get him to drink one of these.
He won't, but go ahead and try.

156
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,168
Dad?

157
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:31,932
You want some water?

158
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:52,494
- You are in for a surprise.
- Am I?

159
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:55,330
Having a kid changes everything.

160
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:59,334
There's the diapers and the burping
and the midnight feeding.

161
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:02,546
- Did you do any of that?
- No.

162
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:05,549
But I hear it's terrible.

163
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:11,221
Then you spend years trying
to corrupt and mislead this child...

164
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:16,101
...fill its head with nonsense,
and still it turns out perfectly fine.

165
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,190
- You think I'm up for it?
- You learned from the best.

166
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:27,487
Drink half the can.
I'll tell Mom you drank it all.

167
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:29,531
Everyone wins.

168
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:33,994
People needn't worry so much.
It's not my time yet.

169
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:36,038
This is not how I go.

170
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,209
- Really?
- Truly. I saw it in The Eye.

171
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:44,379
- The old lady by the swamp?
- She was a witch.

172
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:47,257
No, she was old and probably senile.

173
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:52,721
I saw my death in that eye,
and this isn't how it happens.

174
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:54,806
So how does it happen?

175
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:59,520
Surprise ending.
Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.

176
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:03,440
Your mother thought
we wouldn't talk again.

177
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:06,401
Look at us. We're talking fine.

178
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,445
We're storytellers, both of us.

179
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:14,159
I speak mine out,
you write yours down. Same thing.

180
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:17,287
Dad...

181
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:22,626
I hope to talk about some things
while I'm here.

182
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:25,254
You mean while I'm here.

183
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:29,383
I just want to know
the true versions of things:

184
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:32,427
Events. Stories.

185
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:33,971
You.

186
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:48,277
Your mother hasn't been
keeping up the pool.

187
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:51,989
- lf you wanted to, you could fix it.
- Yeah, I will.

188
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:55,284
- You know where the chemicals are?
- I did it when you were gone.

189
00:17:55,659 --> 00:18:01,623
I was never much for being
at home, Will. Too confining.

190
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:04,710
And this here, being stuck in bed...

191
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:08,547
Dying is the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

192
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:15,387
- I thought you said you weren't dying.
- I said this isn't how I go.

193
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:19,099
The last part is much more unusual.

194
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:21,935
Trust me on that.

195
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:57,679
Dr. Bennett said I have
to stay at home for a week.

196
00:18:57,721 --> 00:19:01,433
Oh, that's nothing. Once,
I had to stay in bed for three years.

197
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:04,895
- Did you have the chickenpox?
- I wish.

198
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:27,000
Truth is, no one quite knew
what was wrong.

199
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:29,628
Most times a person
grows up gradually...

200
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:32,548
...while I found myself in a hurry.

201
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,888
My muscles and my bones couldn't
keep up with my body's ambition.

202
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:43,308
So I spent the better part
of three years confined to my bed...

203
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:47,688
...with the encyclopedia being
my only means of exploration.

204
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:49,773
I had made it all the way to the G's...

205
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:52,943
...hoping to find an answer
to my "gigantificationism"...

206
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:56,864
...when I uncovered an article
about the common goldfish.

207
00:19:57,281 --> 00:20:00,701
"Kept in a small bowl,
the goldfish will remain small.

208
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:02,536
With more space...

209
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:06,623
...the fish will grow double, triple,
or quadruple its size."

210
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:10,002
It occurred to me then that perhaps
the reason for my growth...

211
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:12,421
...was that I was intended
for larger things.

212
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:16,383
After all, a giant man can't have
an ordinary-sized life.

213
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:21,180
As soon as my bones had settled
in their adult configuration...

214
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:26,268
...I set upon my plan to make
a bigger place for myself in Ashton.

215
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,477
Tigers, go!

216
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:44,912
Edward Bloom!

217
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:31,875
Doggy! My doggy!
My doggy's trapped!

218
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:43,887
I was the biggest thing
Ashton had ever seen.

219
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:47,891
Until one day, a stranger arrived.

220
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:07,578
Calm down. Calm down, everybody.
Calm down. That's enough.

221
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:11,707
- Mr. Mayor, he ate an entire corn field.
- He ate my dog.

222
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:14,543
If you ain't gonna stop him, mayor,
we will.

223
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:17,421
I won't have mob violence
in this town.

224
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:19,840
Now, has someone tried
talking to him?

225
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:22,593
- You can't reason with him.
- He's a monster.

226
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:24,636
I'll do it.

227
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:41,361
I'll talk to him.
See if I can get him to go.

228
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:43,739
That creature could crush you
without trying.

229
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:47,451
Oh, trust me, he'll have to try.

230
00:23:18,482 --> 00:23:19,858
Hello?

231
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:27,783
My name is Edward Bloom,
and I wanna talk to you!

232
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:30,786
Go away!

233
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:36,041
Now, I'm not going anywhere
until you show yourself!

234
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:39,002
I said, go away!

235
00:23:59,523 --> 00:24:01,859
Armed with the foreknowledge
of my own death...

236
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:04,111
...I knew the giant couldn't kill me.

237
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:09,741
All the same, I preferred to keep
my bones unbroken.

238
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:11,994
Why are you here?

239
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:14,913
So you can eat me.

240
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:19,293
The town decided to send
a human sacrifice and I volunteered.

241
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:23,005
My arms are a little stringy, but
there's some good eating in my legs.

242
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:26,884
I mean, I'd be tempted
to eat them myself.

243
00:24:28,552 --> 00:24:30,596
So I guess, well...

244
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:35,225
If you'd just get it over with quick,
because I'm not much for pain, really.

245
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:51,158
Oh, come on! I can't go back!
I'm a human sacrifice!

246
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:53,952
If I go back,
they'll think I'm a coward.

247
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:56,705
I'd rather be dinner than a coward.

248
00:24:57,581 --> 00:24:58,707
Here.

249
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:02,127
You can start with my hand.
It'll be an appetizer.

250
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:06,798
I don't want to eat you.
I don't want to eat anybody.

251
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:10,636
I just get so hungry.
I'm just too big.

252
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:14,890
Did you ever think that
maybe you're not too big...

253
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:17,184
...but maybe this town
is just too small?

254
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,978
I've heard in real cities
there are buildings so tall...

255
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:22,439
...you can't even see
the tops of them.

256
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:24,983
- Really?
- Oh, I wouldn't lie to you.

257
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:27,528
And all-you-can-eat buffets.

258
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:30,572
- Now, you can eat a lot, can't you?
- I can.

259
00:25:30,614 --> 00:25:33,534
So why are you wasting your time
in a small town?

260
00:25:34,117 --> 00:25:37,162
You're a big man.
You should be in a big city.

261
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,249
You're just trying to get me
to leave, aren't you?

262
00:25:40,624 --> 00:25:44,044
- What's your name, giant?
- Karl.

263
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:47,631
Well, mine's Edward.
And truthfully...

264
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:51,927
Well, I do want you to leave, Karl.
But I want to leave with you.

265
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:54,930
I mean, you think this town
is too small for you?

266
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:58,183
Well, it's too small for a man
of my ambition.

267
00:25:58,141 --> 00:26:01,270
So, what do you say? Join me?

268
00:26:04,648 --> 00:26:05,774
Okay.

269
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,694
Okay.

270
00:26:08,652 --> 00:26:11,780
Now, first, we gotta
get you ready for the city.

271
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:32,885
Edward Bloom, first son of Ashton...

272
00:26:33,177 --> 00:26:36,722
...it's with a heavy heart
that we see you go.

273
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:39,850
But take with you
this key to the city...

274
00:26:39,683 --> 00:26:42,603
...and know that any time
you want to come back...

275
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:45,731
...all our doors are open to you.

276
00:26:54,698 --> 00:26:58,702
That afternoon as I left Ashton,
everyone seemed to have advice.

277
00:26:58,702 --> 00:27:01,830
Find yourself a nice girl, now!

278
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:05,209
Watch your pride, Edward Bloom!

279
00:27:05,209 --> 00:27:09,922
But there was one person whose
counsel I held above all others.

280
00:27:13,717 --> 00:27:16,303
She said that the biggest fish
in the river...

281
00:27:17,221 --> 00:27:19,848
...gets that way
by never being caught.

282
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:27,689
- What'd she say?
- Beats me.

283
00:27:40,244 --> 00:27:41,370
There were two roads out of Ashton:

284
00:27:42,246 --> 00:27:44,623
A new one which was paved
and an older one that wasn't.

285
00:27:44,748 --> 00:27:46,750
People didn't use
the old one anymore...

286
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,545
...and it had developed a reputation
for being haunted.

287
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:52,881
Well, since I had no intention
of ever returning to Ashton...

288
00:27:53,257 --> 00:27:57,386
...this seemed as good a time as any
to find out what lay down that old one.

289
00:27:57,761 --> 00:28:02,349
- You know anyone who's taken it?
- That poet, Norther Winslow, did.

290
00:28:02,766 --> 00:28:05,143
He was going to Paris, France.

291
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:08,772
I guess he liked it.
No one ever heard from him again.

292
00:28:09,273 --> 00:28:11,358
I'll tell you what.
You go the other way.

293
00:28:11,275 --> 00:28:14,903
I'll cut through here,
and I'll meet you on the far side.

294
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,324
You're just trying to run away,
aren't you?

295
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:21,952
Here.

296
00:28:23,287 --> 00:28:26,540
Just to be sure, you can take my pack.

297
00:29:05,829 --> 00:29:08,332
Why, you son of a...

298
00:29:34,358 --> 00:29:36,360
Now, there comes a point
when a reasonable man...

299
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:41,156
...will swallow his pride and admit
that he's made a terrible mistake.

300
00:29:41,365 --> 00:29:46,286
The truth is,
I was never a reasonable man.

301
00:29:47,371 --> 00:29:50,082
And what I recall of
Sunday school was that...

302
00:29:50,374 --> 00:29:55,420
...the more difficult something is,
the more rewarding it is in the end.

303
00:30:54,605 --> 00:30:57,149
Friend! Welcome to you!

304
00:30:58,108 --> 00:31:01,069
- What's your name?
- Edward Bloom.

305
00:31:02,112 --> 00:31:05,115
- "Bloom" like a flower?
- Yes.

306
00:31:05,115 --> 00:31:09,161
Oh, here! Here you are, right here.
"Edward Bloom."

307
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,997
We weren't expecting you yet.

308
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:14,166
- You were expecting me?
- Not yet.

309
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:19,254
- You must've taken a shortcut.
- Why, yes, I did. It almost killed me.

310
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:23,675
Life will do that to you.
And truthfully, the long way is easier.

311
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:26,970
- But it's longer.
- Much longer.

312
00:31:27,137 --> 00:31:30,015
And you're here now,
and that's what matters.

313
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,266
What is this place?

314
00:31:31,642 --> 00:31:34,937
The town of Spectre.
Best-kept secret in Alabama!

315
00:31:35,145 --> 00:31:38,440
Now, it says here
you're from Ashton, right?

316
00:31:38,649 --> 00:31:42,027
Last person we had from Ashton
was Norther Winslow.

317
00:31:42,152 --> 00:31:44,071
The poet?
Whatever happened to him?

318
00:31:44,154 --> 00:31:48,408
He's still here. Let me buy you a drink.
I'll tell you all about it.

319
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:50,369
Hell, I'll have him tell you!

320
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:54,206
I have to meet somebody,
and I'm already running late.

321
00:31:54,164 --> 00:31:58,043
Now, son, I already told you.
You're early.

322
00:32:32,703 --> 00:32:35,747
Now, tell me if that isn't
the best pie you ever ate.

323
00:32:36,707 --> 00:32:37,666
It truly is.

324
00:32:42,212 --> 00:32:46,383
Well, everything tastes better here.
Even the water is sweet.

325
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:51,388
Never gets too hot,
too cold, too humid.

326
00:32:52,222 --> 00:32:55,309
At night, the wind goes through
the trees where you'd swear...

327
00:32:55,726 --> 00:32:59,396
...there was a whole symphony
out there playing just for you.

328
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:03,984
Hey! Jenny!

329
00:33:05,235 --> 00:33:06,528
Come back here!

330
00:33:12,242 --> 00:33:13,535
Jenny!

331
00:33:29,259 --> 00:33:31,011
Hey, I need those.

332
00:33:31,762 --> 00:33:35,182
- There is no softer ground than town.
- That almost rhymes.

333
00:33:35,265 --> 00:33:37,601
He's our poet laureate. Come on.

334
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:44,650
I agreed to spend the afternoon,
if only to understand...

335
00:33:45,275 --> 00:33:49,446
...the mystery of how a place could
feel so strange and yet so familiar.

336
00:33:53,784 --> 00:33:56,370
I've been working on this poem
for 12 years.

337
00:33:56,286 --> 00:33:58,038
Really?

338
00:33:58,288 --> 00:34:03,544
There's a lot of expectation.
I don't wanna disappoint my fans.

339
00:34:03,794 --> 00:34:05,254
May I?

340
00:34:25,816 --> 00:34:27,442
It's only three lines long.

341
00:34:30,821 --> 00:34:34,116
This is why you should never show
a work in progress.

342
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,840
I got him!

343
00:35:47,397 --> 00:35:49,066
There's leeches in there.

344
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,861
- Did you see that woman?
- What did she look like?

345
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:56,698
- Well, she was...
- Was she naked?

346
00:35:58,909 --> 00:36:00,452
Yes, she was.

347
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:04,581
It's not a woman. It's a fish.
No one ever catches her.

348
00:36:05,415 --> 00:36:07,459
Fish looks different
to different people.

349
00:36:07,918 --> 00:36:11,713
My daddy said it looked like the
coon dog he had when he was a kid...

350
00:36:12,422 --> 00:36:14,466
...back from the dead.

351
00:36:17,928 --> 00:36:19,763
Oh, darn.

352
00:36:21,932 --> 00:36:24,268
- How old are you?
- Eighteen.

353
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:28,438
I'm 8. That means when I'm 18,
you'll be 28.

354
00:36:28,438 --> 00:36:33,193
- And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
- You're pretty good at arithmetic.

355
00:36:33,443 --> 00:36:37,823
And when I'm 38, you'll be 48.
That's not much difference at all.

356
00:36:37,948 --> 00:36:40,742
Sure is a lot now, though, huh?

357
00:37:14,484 --> 00:37:17,154
Hey, Edward!

358
00:37:30,501 --> 00:37:32,586
I love Spectre...

359
00:37:38,509 --> 00:37:40,427
Excuse me.

360
00:37:46,517 --> 00:37:49,811
Jenny thinks you're quite a catch.
We all do.

361
00:37:51,021 --> 00:37:52,564
What?

362
00:37:52,523 --> 00:37:55,651
I said, you're quite a catch.

363
00:38:18,048 --> 00:38:19,800
I have to leave.

364
00:38:23,554 --> 00:38:24,805
Tonight.

365
00:38:25,556 --> 00:38:26,723
Why?

366
00:38:28,058 --> 00:38:30,394
This town is more than any man
could ask for.

367
00:38:31,061 --> 00:38:34,606
And if I were to end up here,
I would consider myself lucky.

368
00:38:34,565 --> 00:38:38,443
But the truth is, I'm just not ready
to end up anywhere.

369
00:38:39,069 --> 00:38:40,737
But no one's ever left.

370
00:38:42,072 --> 00:38:45,450
How are you gonna make it
without your shoes?

371
00:38:45,576 --> 00:38:48,036
Well, I suspect it will hurt. A lot.

372
00:38:52,082 --> 00:38:54,710
Now, I'm sorry, but...
Well, goodbye.

373
00:38:58,589 --> 00:39:02,092
- You won't find a better place.
- I don't expect to.

374
00:39:07,598 --> 00:39:09,266
Promise me you'll come back.

375
00:39:10,601 --> 00:39:15,397
I promise. Someday.
When I'm really supposed to.

376
00:39:46,637 --> 00:39:49,932
That night,
I reached two conclusions.

377
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:55,062
The first was that a dangerous path
is made much worse by darkness.

378
00:39:56,146 --> 00:40:00,150
The second was that I was
hopelessly and irrevocably lost.

379
00:40:00,651 --> 00:40:03,612
These woods would become
my graveyard.

380
00:40:05,656 --> 00:40:10,536
As difficult as it was to reach Spectre,
I was fated to get there eventually.

381
00:40:11,161 --> 00:40:15,082
After all, no man can avoid
reaching the end of his life.

382
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:33,517
And then I realized
this wasn't the end of my life.

383
00:40:33,684 --> 00:40:36,645
This isn't how I die.

384
00:40:53,704 --> 00:40:54,913
Friend.

385
00:40:55,706 --> 00:40:59,835
- What happened to your shoes?
- They kind of got ahead of me.

386
00:41:16,226 --> 00:41:19,396
I don't know if you saw it,
but Josephine had some photos...

387
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:21,148
...in the most recent Newsweek.

388
00:41:23,734 --> 00:41:25,068
Really?

389
00:41:25,235 --> 00:41:26,612
That's just wonderful.

390
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:33,035
I spent a week in Morocco
for the story. It was incredible.

391
00:41:33,243 --> 00:41:37,748
Oh. We'll have to pick up a copy.

392
00:41:47,758 --> 00:41:50,761
I don't know if you're aware of this,
Josephine...

393
00:41:52,262 --> 00:41:56,808
...but African parrots, in their native
Congo, they speak only French.

394
00:41:57,768 --> 00:41:58,936
Really?

395
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:02,981
You're lucky to get four words
out of them in English.

396
00:42:03,273 --> 00:42:06,109
But if you were to walk
through the jungle...

397
00:42:06,276 --> 00:42:09,988
...you'd hear them speaking
the most elaborate French.

398
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:15,869
Those parrots talk about everything.
Politics, movies, fashion.

399
00:42:15,786 --> 00:42:18,455
Everything but religion.

400
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:20,999
Why not religion, Dad?

401
00:42:21,792 --> 00:42:26,255
It's rude to talk about religion. You
never know who you're gonna offend.

402
00:42:31,802 --> 00:42:34,930
Josephine actually went
to the Congo last year.

403
00:42:36,807 --> 00:42:38,767
Oh, so you know.

404
00:42:54,324 --> 00:42:56,785
Hello.

405
00:42:56,827 --> 00:42:59,079
Hi. How are you feeling?

406
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:04,168
Oh, I was dreaming.

407
00:43:04,334 --> 00:43:07,504
What were you dreaming about?

408
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:10,799
Oh, I don't usually remember...

409
00:43:10,841 --> 00:43:15,095
...unless they're especially portentous.
Do you know what that word means?

410
00:43:15,846 --> 00:43:18,473
It means when you dream about
something that's gonna happen.

411
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:21,852
Like one night, I had a dream...

412
00:43:21,852 --> 00:43:26,648
...where this crow came and said:

413
00:43:26,857 --> 00:43:29,401
"Your aunt is gonna die."

414
00:43:30,861 --> 00:43:33,989
I was so scared,
I woke up my parents...

415
00:43:33,864 --> 00:43:37,993
...but they said it was just a dream
and to get back to bed.

416
00:43:38,368 --> 00:43:41,914
But the next morning,
my Aunt Stacy was dead.

417
00:43:42,372 --> 00:43:44,291
That's terrible.

418
00:43:44,374 --> 00:43:50,088
Terrible for her, but think about me,
young boy with that kind of power.

419
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:55,052
Wasn't three weeks later when the
crow came back to me in a dream...

420
00:43:54,885 --> 00:43:59,598
...and said, "Your daddy's gonna die."

421
00:44:01,391 --> 00:44:02,851
I didn't know what to do.

422
00:44:02,893 --> 00:44:06,522
I finally told my father, but he said:

423
00:44:06,897 --> 00:44:12,694
"Oh, not to worry."
But I could see he was rattled.

424
00:44:12,903 --> 00:44:15,697
The next morning, he wasn't himself.

425
00:44:15,906 --> 00:44:20,327
Kept looking around, waiting for
something to drop on his head.

426
00:44:20,911 --> 00:44:25,916
Because the crow didn't say how it
was gonna happen, just those words:

427
00:44:25,916 --> 00:44:28,043
"Your daddy's gonna die."

428
00:44:28,919 --> 00:44:34,800
Well, he left home early
and was gone a long time.

429
00:44:34,925 --> 00:44:37,678
When he finally came back,
he looked terrible...

430
00:44:37,928 --> 00:44:41,098
...like he was waiting
for the ax to fall all day.

431
00:44:41,932 --> 00:44:43,684
He said to my mother:

432
00:44:43,934 --> 00:44:47,688
"I've just had the worst day of my life."

433
00:44:47,938 --> 00:44:51,859
"You think you've had a bad day?"
she said.

434
00:44:51,942 --> 00:44:56,989
"This morning, the milkman
dropped dead on the porch."

435
00:44:59,449 --> 00:45:03,745
Because, see, my mother
was banging the milkman.

436
00:45:05,455 --> 00:45:10,127
- Can I take your picture?
- Oh, you don't need a picture.

437
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:14,089
Just look up the word "handsome"
in the dictionary.

438
00:45:14,464 --> 00:45:15,674
Please?

439
00:45:17,467 --> 00:45:18,969
All right.

440
00:45:22,472 --> 00:45:24,474
I have photos of the wedding
to show you.

441
00:45:24,975 --> 00:45:26,977
There is a great one
of you and my father.

442
00:45:33,483 --> 00:45:38,113
I want to see pictures of your wedding.
I've never seen any.

443
00:45:37,988 --> 00:45:41,617
That's because we didn't have
a proper wedding.

444
00:45:41,992 --> 00:45:45,245
Your mother-in-law was
never supposed to marry me.

445
00:45:45,495 --> 00:45:49,291
- She was engaged to somebody else.
- I never knew.

446
00:45:49,499 --> 00:45:52,127
Will never told you?

447
00:45:52,503 --> 00:45:54,796
Probably just as well.

448
00:45:55,005 --> 00:45:57,633
He would have told it wrong, anyway.

449
00:45:58,008 --> 00:46:01,136
All the facts, none of the flavor.

450
00:46:01,512 --> 00:46:05,182
Oh. So this is a tall tale.

451
00:46:06,016 --> 00:46:09,311
Well, it's not a short one.

452
00:46:12,022 --> 00:46:13,899
I'd just left Spectre and was
on my way to discover my destiny.

453
00:46:14,024 --> 00:46:14,650
I'd just left Spectre and was
on my way to discover my destiny.

454
00:46:15,108 --> 00:46:16,944
I'd just left Spectre and was
on my way to discover my destiny.

455
00:46:17,027 --> 00:46:19,905
Not knowing what
that would be exactly...

456
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:24,868
...I explored every opportunity
that presented itself.

457
00:46:54,064 --> 00:46:57,818
Coco! Coco! There they are.

458
00:46:59,069 --> 00:47:02,364
Ladies and gentlemen!

459
00:47:03,073 --> 00:47:06,660
You may think
you've seen the unusual.

460
00:47:07,578 --> 00:47:12,207
You may think you've seen the bizarre.

461
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:17,880
But I've traveled
to the five corners of the world...

462
00:47:18,088 --> 00:47:25,053
...and let me tell you,
I've never seen anything like this!

463
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,060
When I met this man...

464
00:47:32,603 --> 00:47:35,272
...he was picking oranges in Florida.

465
00:47:35,105 --> 00:47:39,067
His fellow workers called him
El Penumbra. "The Shadow."

466
00:47:41,111 --> 00:47:43,572
Because when you worked
beside him...

467
00:47:44,114 --> 00:47:46,241
...he blocked out the daylight!

468
00:47:47,117 --> 00:47:51,079
Not to alarm you, ma'am,
but if this man wanted to...

469
00:47:51,622 --> 00:47:56,084
...he could crush your head
between his toes...

470
00:47:56,126 --> 00:47:59,546
...like a tiny walnut.
But he won't do it.

471
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:02,257
No. No, ladies and gentlemen...

472
00:48:02,633 --> 00:48:04,676
...he will not hurt her...

473
00:48:05,135 --> 00:48:08,555
...because he is our own gentle giant.

474
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:16,230
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Colossus!

475
00:49:40,731 --> 00:49:44,359
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls...

476
00:49:44,234 --> 00:49:46,528
...thank y'all for coming.

477
00:49:47,738 --> 00:49:50,616
Drive home safely, everyone.
Thank you for coming.

478
00:49:51,241 --> 00:49:54,745
It was on that night
Karl met his destiny.

479
00:49:55,746 --> 00:49:58,498
And I met mine, almost.

480
00:49:58,749 --> 00:50:03,545
They say when you meet
the love of your life, time stops.

481
00:50:03,754 --> 00:50:05,255
And that's true.

482
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:53,345
What they don't tell you
is that once time starts again...

483
00:50:54,304 --> 00:50:57,933
...it moves extra fast to catch up.

484
00:51:30,841 --> 00:51:32,301
What's your name?

485
00:51:33,343 --> 00:51:37,222
- It's Karl.
- Karl.

486
00:51:42,853 --> 00:51:48,400
Tell me, Karl, have you ever heard
the term "involuntary servitude"?

487
00:51:48,358 --> 00:51:51,153
- No.
- "Unconscionable contract"?

488
00:51:53,363 --> 00:51:56,200
- Nope.
- Great.

489
00:51:56,366 --> 00:51:58,368
Here you go.

490
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:01,580
Here you are.

491
00:52:04,875 --> 00:52:07,628
Mr. Soggybottom,
come down this here...

492
00:52:07,878 --> 00:52:10,047
...so he can use your back
to sign on it.

493
00:52:22,893 --> 00:52:25,020
Okay. Thank you. Yeah.

494
00:52:26,396 --> 00:52:28,273
Hey, kid.

495
00:52:28,398 --> 00:52:31,693
- Your friend just made himself a star.
- Oh, that's great.

496
00:52:34,404 --> 00:52:36,490
- My attorney, Mr. Soggybottom.
- Good to meet you.

497
00:52:36,907 --> 00:52:38,534
Pleased to meet you.

498
00:52:43,413 --> 00:52:46,416
What's the matter? I haven't
seen a customer so depressed...

499
00:52:46,917 --> 00:52:50,212
...since the elephant sat
on that farmer's wife.

500
00:52:51,421 --> 00:52:53,507
"Depressed"?

501
00:52:55,425 --> 00:52:57,719
See? The big guy likes it.

502
00:52:58,428 --> 00:53:00,430
I just saw the woman I'm gonna marry.

503
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:03,475
I know it. But I lost her.

504
00:53:04,935 --> 00:53:06,311
Oh, tough break.

505
00:53:06,436 --> 00:53:10,274
Well, most men have to get married
before they lose their wives.

506
00:53:10,399 --> 00:53:15,487
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life
looking for her. That or die alone.

507
00:53:15,946 --> 00:53:17,781
Damn, kid.

508
00:53:20,951 --> 00:53:23,412
Let me guess. Real pretty?

509
00:53:24,413 --> 00:53:26,290
Reddish-blondish hair?

510
00:53:28,417 --> 00:53:29,710
Blue dress?

511
00:53:30,961 --> 00:53:32,421
Yeah!

512
00:53:32,963 --> 00:53:35,924
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.

513
00:53:35,966 --> 00:53:38,093
Who is she? Where does she live?

514
00:53:38,427 --> 00:53:41,263
Forget it. Don't waste your time.
She's out of your league.

515
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:44,808
- What? You don't even know me.
- Sure I do.

516
00:53:44,975 --> 00:53:49,479
You were hot shit back in Hickville, but
here in the real world, you got squat.

517
00:53:49,438 --> 00:53:51,398
You don't have a plan or a job.

518
00:53:51,982 --> 00:53:54,443
Nothing except the clothes
on your back.

519
00:53:54,443 --> 00:53:57,362
Well, I have a whole backpack
full of clothes.

520
00:53:58,989 --> 00:54:01,742
Oh, someone stole my backpack.

521
00:54:02,451 --> 00:54:06,413
You were a big fish in a small pond,
but this here is the ocean...

522
00:54:06,455 --> 00:54:08,916
...and you're drowning.
Go back to Puddleville.

523
00:54:09,458 --> 00:54:12,503
- You'll be happy there.
- You say I don't have a plan. I do.

524
00:54:13,003 --> 00:54:16,632
I'll find that girl, marry her,
and spend the rest of my life with her.

525
00:54:17,007 --> 00:54:20,719
I don't have a job, but I would
have a job if you gave me one.

526
00:54:21,011 --> 00:54:22,971
And I may not have much...

527
00:54:23,013 --> 00:54:26,683
...but I have more determination
than any man you're likely to meet.

528
00:54:29,019 --> 00:54:32,648
I'm sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
Come on, big boy.

529
00:54:33,482 --> 00:54:35,817
Wait. Look, I'll work
night and day for you...

530
00:54:36,485 --> 00:54:37,653
...and you won't have to pay me.

531
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:42,991
You just have to tell me who she is.

532
00:54:46,495 --> 00:54:48,497
Every month you work for me...

533
00:54:48,497 --> 00:54:51,834
...l'll tell you one thing about her.
That's my final offer.

534
00:54:56,046 --> 00:54:58,590
Let's get started.

535
00:55:12,062 --> 00:55:15,691
From that moment on, I did everything
Mr. Calloway asked.

536
00:55:15,524 --> 00:55:18,443
I'd go three days
without stopping to eat.

537
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:21,196
And four days without sleeping.

538
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:24,366
What kept me going was
the promise of meeting the girl...

539
00:55:24,533 --> 00:55:25,742
...who would be my wife.

540
00:55:33,542 --> 00:55:35,878
Stick together, that's the way
it's gonna be.

541
00:55:36,086 --> 00:55:39,923
- The way it was, and the way it will be.
- Mr. Calloway, sir?

542
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:41,633
It's been a month today.

543
00:55:44,094 --> 00:55:47,222
This girl, the love of your life...

544
00:55:48,098 --> 00:55:52,644
...her favorite flowers are daffodils.

545
00:55:53,562 --> 00:55:57,524
- So get that stuff...
- Daffodils.

546
00:55:58,567 --> 00:56:00,903
Daffodils.

547
00:56:02,571 --> 00:56:04,740
Daffodils.

548
00:56:10,579 --> 00:56:12,247
True to his word...

549
00:56:12,581 --> 00:56:15,209
...every month Amos would tell me
something new...

550
00:56:15,584 --> 00:56:17,878
...about the woman of my dreams.

551
00:56:18,128 --> 00:56:21,006
Enjoy yourselves, enjoy yourselves.

552
00:56:21,131 --> 00:56:22,674
She's going to college.

553
00:56:23,133 --> 00:56:27,304
College. She's going to college.

554
00:56:37,606 --> 00:56:38,982
She likes music.

555
00:56:39,608 --> 00:56:43,403
Music. She likes music.

556
00:56:48,158 --> 00:56:50,160
Over the months, I learned a lot
about the woman I would marry...

557
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,788
Over the months, I learned a lot
about the woman I would marry...

558
00:56:52,621 --> 00:56:55,749
...but not her name,
and not where to find her.

559
00:56:55,624 --> 00:57:00,379
That time had come.
I couldn't wait any longer.

560
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,851
Mr. Calloway?

561
00:57:16,186 --> 00:57:19,565
It's Edward Bloom.
I need to talk to you.

562
00:57:23,652 --> 00:57:25,988
Mr. Calloway?

563
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:01,899
No. Wait!

564
00:58:19,708 --> 00:58:24,171
That night, I discovered that most
things you consider evil or wicked...

565
00:58:24,254 --> 00:58:28,091
...are simply lonely and lacking
in social niceties.

566
00:59:02,751 --> 00:59:04,837
Didn't kill anything, did I?

567
00:59:05,754 --> 00:59:10,092
A few rabbits. But I think one of them
was already dead.

568
00:59:13,303 --> 00:59:16,265
That would explain the indigestion.

569
00:59:23,772 --> 00:59:25,691
Thank you.

570
00:59:27,776 --> 00:59:29,611
I was wrong about you, kid.

571
00:59:29,778 --> 00:59:33,115
You may not have much,
but what you got, you got a lot of.

572
00:59:33,782 --> 00:59:36,118
You could get any girl.

573
00:59:36,326 --> 00:59:38,287
There's only one I want.

574
00:59:42,791 --> 00:59:44,042
Her name...

575
00:59:47,796 --> 00:59:49,923
...is Sandra Templeton.

576
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,761
She goes to Auburn.

577
00:59:54,803 --> 00:59:59,057
Semester's almost over,
so you better hurry.

578
00:59:59,349 --> 01:00:00,851
Thank you. Thank you.

579
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:04,229
- Good luck, kid!
- Thank you, sir!

580
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:17,284
- Bye, now.
- Bye, Edward.

581
01:00:20,996 --> 01:00:24,333
After saying my goodbyes,
I hopped three trains...

582
01:00:24,541 --> 01:00:27,961
...to get to Auburn that afternoon.

583
01:01:03,038 --> 01:01:06,875
You don't know me,
but my name is Edward Bloom...

584
01:01:07,042 --> 01:01:08,335
...and I love you.

585
01:01:10,045 --> 01:01:13,799
I've spent the last three years
working to find out who you are.

586
01:01:14,049 --> 01:01:18,262
I've been shot, stabbed, and trampled
a few times. I broke my ribs twice.

587
01:01:18,595 --> 01:01:21,557
But it's all been worth it
to see you here now...

588
01:01:22,057 --> 01:01:25,018
...and to finally get to talk to you.

589
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:27,354
Because I'm destined to marry you.

590
01:01:28,063 --> 01:01:34,027
I knew it when I saw you at the circus,
and I know it now more than ever.

591
01:01:36,071 --> 01:01:39,408
- I'm sorry.
- You don't have to apologize to me.

592
01:01:39,074 --> 01:01:41,493
I'm the luckiest person
you'll find today.

593
01:01:42,077 --> 01:01:45,163
No, I'm sorry I'm engaged
to be married.

594
01:01:52,087 --> 01:01:55,215
But you're wrong. I do know you.

595
01:01:55,632 --> 01:01:57,593
At least by reputation.

596
01:01:58,635 --> 01:02:01,096
Edward Bloom from Ashton.

597
01:02:01,096 --> 01:02:05,559
See, I'm actually engaged
to a boy from Ashton. Don Price.

598
01:02:06,643 --> 01:02:09,188
He was a few years older than you.

599
01:02:20,115 --> 01:02:21,491
Well...

600
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:25,204
Congratulations.

601
01:02:28,123 --> 01:02:30,709
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

602
01:02:36,131 --> 01:02:39,176
Stop it! It's not funny.

603
01:02:40,135 --> 01:02:42,262
That poor boy.

604
01:02:42,679 --> 01:02:45,766
Fate has a cruel way
of circling around on you.

605
01:02:46,141 --> 01:02:48,143
After all this work to leave Ashton...

606
01:02:48,143 --> 01:02:53,649
...the girl I love was now engaged
to one of its biggest jerks.

607
01:02:54,149 --> 01:02:56,318
There's a time when a man
needs to fight...

608
01:02:56,151 --> 01:02:59,696
...and a time when he needs to accept
that his destiny's lost...

609
01:03:00,155 --> 01:03:04,243
...the ship has sailed,
and that only a fool will continue.

610
01:03:04,159 --> 01:03:07,371
Truth is, I've always been a fool.

611
01:03:08,705 --> 01:03:13,418
Sandra Templeton, I love you,
and I will marry you!

612
01:03:18,298 --> 01:03:18,590
So as you can see, if we apply
these rules to our everyday life...

613
01:03:22,177 --> 01:03:25,097
...supply and demand
makes much more sense.

614
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:29,142
Take a look at the next graph, and the
import of this will be even stronger...

615
01:03:38,193 --> 01:03:40,904
- for three hours.

616
01:03:40,737 --> 01:03:42,573
Look!

617
01:04:13,729 --> 01:04:16,899
- Daffodils!
- They're your favorite flower.

618
01:04:17,232 --> 01:04:18,734
How did you get so many?

619
01:04:19,735 --> 01:04:21,320
I called everywhere in five states.

620
01:04:21,737 --> 01:04:24,698
I told them it was the only way
to get my wife to marry me.

621
01:04:26,742 --> 01:04:28,493
You don't even know me.

622
01:04:29,244 --> 01:04:31,747
I have the rest of my life to find out.

623
01:04:32,748 --> 01:04:34,416
Sandra!

624
01:04:36,752 --> 01:04:38,921
It's Don. Promise you won't hurt him.

625
01:04:38,754 --> 01:04:41,715
If that's what you want, I swear to it.

626
01:04:42,257 --> 01:04:44,593
- Bloom?
- Don.

627
01:04:45,761 --> 01:04:50,057
What the hell are you doing?
This is my girl. Mine!

628
01:04:50,265 --> 01:04:52,893
I wasn't aware
that she belonged to anyone.

629
01:04:55,771 --> 01:04:58,774
What's the matter?
Are you too scared to fight back?

630
01:04:59,274 --> 01:05:00,943
I promised I wouldn't.

631
01:05:01,777 --> 01:05:04,571
Stop it!

632
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:05,989
Don, stop!

633
01:05:06,782 --> 01:05:11,828
While I took the beating of a lifetime,
Don Price was ultimately defeated.

634
01:05:11,787 --> 01:05:16,583
All the physical activity had worsened
a congenital valve defect.

635
01:05:16,792 --> 01:05:18,919
Put simply, his heart
wasn't strong enough.

636
01:05:31,807 --> 01:05:34,142
Don! I will never marry you.

637
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:37,521
What?
You mean, you love this guy?

638
01:05:37,813 --> 01:05:40,941
He's almost a stranger,
and I prefer him to you.

639
01:06:09,344 --> 01:06:14,808
As it turned out, Sandra was able to
keep her same date at the chapel.

640
01:06:14,850 --> 01:06:17,978
Only the groom had changed.

641
01:06:18,854 --> 01:06:22,858
I thought you said you didn't
have a church wedding.

642
01:06:22,858 --> 01:06:25,944
We were all set to,
but there was a complication.

643
01:06:29,865 --> 01:06:33,619
Is it the medicine
that's making you thirsty?

644
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:37,956
Truth is,
I've been thirsty my whole life.

645
01:06:38,874 --> 01:06:41,460
Never really known why.

646
01:06:42,878 --> 01:06:45,047
There was a time when I was 11...

647
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,798
You were talking about your wedding.

648
01:06:47,382 --> 01:06:51,303
I didn't forget.
I was just working on a tangent.

649
01:06:51,887 --> 01:06:55,098
You see, most men, they'll tell you
a story straight through.

650
01:06:55,390 --> 01:06:59,144
It won't be complicated,
but it won't be interesting, either.

651
01:06:59,895 --> 01:07:01,271
I like your stories.

652
01:07:00,896 --> 01:07:01,396
And I like you.

653
01:07:01,897 --> 01:07:03,273
And I like you.

654
01:07:02,898 --> 01:07:03,690
Well, when you work for the circus,
you don't have a regular address.

655
01:07:04,149 --> 01:07:07,778
Well, when you work for the circus,
you don't have a regular address.

656
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:11,031
So after three years,
there was a lot of undelivered mail.

657
01:07:11,907 --> 01:07:14,785
During the four weeks
I was in the hospital...

658
01:07:14,910 --> 01:07:17,371
...the postmaster
finally caught up with me.

659
01:07:17,412 --> 01:07:20,832
And it seems that while my heart
belonged to Sandra...

660
01:07:20,916 --> 01:07:26,588
...the rest of my body belonged
to the U.S. government.

661
01:07:43,939 --> 01:07:47,776
A hitch in the Army was up to
three years at that point...

662
01:07:47,943 --> 01:07:50,946
...and having waited three years
just to meet Sandra...

663
01:07:50,946 --> 01:07:54,908
...I knew I couldn't survive
being away from her that long.

664
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:58,036
So I took every hazardous
assignment I could find...

665
01:07:58,453 --> 01:08:02,875
...with the hope of getting
my time down to less than a year.

666
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:05,377
Go! Go!

667
01:08:07,963 --> 01:08:09,965
When I was offered
a secret mission...

668
01:08:09,965 --> 01:08:13,886
...to steal the plans for
the Wong Kai Tang power plant...

669
01:08:14,469 --> 01:08:17,764
...I jumped at the chance
to serve my country.

670
01:08:20,976 --> 01:08:23,145
Go! Go!

671
01:10:18,594 --> 01:10:21,138
Any of you got needs?

672
01:12:06,702 --> 01:12:08,704
How could you miss your cue?

673
01:12:09,204 --> 01:12:13,166
You make me look like a fool
out there alone.

674
01:12:13,208 --> 01:12:14,793
You weren't alone!

675
01:12:17,212 --> 01:12:18,338
Who the hell are you?

676
01:12:18,213 --> 01:12:20,007
I'm not going to hurt you.

677
01:12:20,215 --> 01:12:21,175
Damn right you're not.

678
01:12:21,717 --> 01:12:22,676
GUARD!

679
01:12:24,219 --> 01:12:25,888
Tell your men not to bother us!

680
01:12:26,221 --> 01:12:27,472
And close that curtain!

681
01:12:30,225 --> 01:12:32,311
Please, I need your help.

682
01:12:33,228 --> 01:12:35,647
What makes you think we'll help you?

683
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:49,286
Over the next hour, I described
my love for Sandra K. Templeton...

684
01:12:49,244 --> 01:12:52,122
...and the ordeal that brought me
before them.

685
01:12:52,247 --> 01:12:55,709
As it had always been,
this love was my salvation.

686
01:12:56,251 --> 01:12:58,337
It was destined to be.

687
01:12:58,253 --> 01:13:01,340
We put together an elaborate
plan for escape...

688
01:13:01,757 --> 01:13:03,884
...involving a whaling ship
to Russia...

689
01:13:04,259 --> 01:13:08,305
...a barge to Cuba,
and a small, dirty canoe to Miami.

690
01:13:08,263 --> 01:13:11,517
We all knew it would be dangerous.

691
01:13:12,267 --> 01:13:14,645
And what are we supposed to do
when we get to America?

692
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:16,522
I can get you bookings.

693
01:13:17,272 --> 01:13:19,608
I know the biggest man
in show business.

694
01:13:20,776 --> 01:13:21,777
Bob Hope?!

695
01:13:22,277 --> 01:13:23,237
Bigger.

696
01:13:27,282 --> 01:13:28,158
Ready?

697
01:13:31,286 --> 01:13:35,123
And so the twins and I
began our arduous journey...

698
01:13:35,290 --> 01:13:37,209
...halfway around the world.

699
01:13:37,292 --> 01:13:41,755
Unfortunately, there was no way
to send a message back to America.

700
01:13:41,797 --> 01:13:45,759
And so it was no surprise
that the Army believed I was dead.

701
01:14:02,317 --> 01:14:04,736
No, God!

702
01:14:06,321 --> 01:14:10,617
After four months, Sandra had gotten
over the worst of the nightmares.

703
01:14:11,326 --> 01:14:15,163
When the phone rang, she didn't think
it was somehow me calling her.

704
01:14:15,330 --> 01:14:20,169
When a car drove past, she didn't
get up to check out the window.

705
01:14:55,370 --> 01:14:58,457
I talked with your father last night.

706
01:15:01,877 --> 01:15:05,005
You never told me
how your parents met.

707
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:07,341
They met at Auburn.

708
01:15:07,382 --> 01:15:11,178
What about the details?
How they fell in love.

709
01:15:11,386 --> 01:15:13,305
The circus. The war.

710
01:15:13,388 --> 01:15:15,307
You never told me any of that.

711
01:15:15,390 --> 01:15:17,476
That's because most of it
never happened.

712
01:15:19,394 --> 01:15:21,522
But it's romantic.

713
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:27,361
- What?
- What, I know better...

714
01:15:27,903 --> 01:15:31,198
...than to argue romance
with a French woman.

715
01:15:32,407 --> 01:15:34,368
Do you love your father?

716
01:15:34,910 --> 01:15:38,539
Everyone loves my father.
He's a very likable guy.

717
01:15:39,915 --> 01:15:41,500
Do you love him?

718
01:15:46,421 --> 01:15:48,382
You have to understand.

719
01:15:48,423 --> 01:15:52,219
When I was growing up,
he was gone more than he was there.

720
01:15:52,427 --> 01:15:56,390
And I started thinking maybe he's got
this second life somewhere else.

721
01:15:57,432 --> 01:16:00,227
Another family, another house.

722
01:16:00,435 --> 01:16:03,647
And he leaves us
and goes to them.

723
01:16:03,939 --> 01:16:05,566
Or, or...

724
01:16:07,943 --> 01:16:12,406
Or maybe there is no second family.
Maybe he never wanted a family.

725
01:16:13,448 --> 01:16:17,411
Whatever it is, he likes his second life
better and he tells his stories...

726
01:16:17,953 --> 01:16:20,497
...because he can't stand
this boring place.

727
01:16:20,455 --> 01:16:23,500
- But it's not true.
- Well, what's true?

728
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:28,255
He's never told me
a single true thing.

729
01:16:30,465 --> 01:16:31,884
Look, hey...

730
01:16:33,468 --> 01:16:36,263
I know why you like him.

731
01:16:36,471 --> 01:16:39,725
I know why everyone likes him.

732
01:16:39,975 --> 01:16:43,187
But I need you to tell me
that I'm not crazy.

733
01:16:43,478 --> 01:16:46,356
Oh, you're not.

734
01:16:48,483 --> 01:16:51,236
And I think you should talk to him.

735
01:16:56,491 --> 01:16:59,578
Larry Puckett's Chevrolet
lets the customer do the talking.

736
01:16:59,494 --> 01:17:03,207
Larry Puckett's GM-certified vehicles
are under factory warranty.

737
01:17:03,498 --> 01:17:07,503
And you can save up to 40 percent
off the original MSRP.

738
01:17:08,003 --> 01:17:10,714
- Did I ever tell you about...?
- Yes.

739
01:17:11,507 --> 01:17:15,010
The maple tree and the Buick?
We've heard it.

740
01:17:17,513 --> 01:17:21,058
I know someone who hasn't.

741
01:17:21,517 --> 01:17:24,978
- The...
- Tree fell on the car, spilling the syrup.

742
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:28,440
Which attracted the flies,
which got stuck to it...

743
01:17:28,524 --> 01:17:31,527
...and flew off with the whole car.

744
01:17:36,532 --> 01:17:39,910
But the real story
is how I got the car.

745
01:17:40,536 --> 01:17:41,828
- You see...
- Dad?

746
01:17:42,037 --> 01:17:43,539
Son.

747
01:17:43,539 --> 01:17:45,499
Can we talk?

748
01:17:48,043 --> 01:17:50,337
I think I'll get started
on these dishes.

749
01:17:50,546 --> 01:17:52,673
I'll help you.

750
01:18:08,564 --> 01:18:11,817
- You know about icebergs, Dad?
- Do I?

751
01:18:11,567 --> 01:18:14,069
I saw an iceberg once.

752
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:17,781
They were hauling it down to Texas
for drinking water.

753
01:18:18,073 --> 01:18:22,077
They didn't count on there being
an elephant frozen inside.

754
01:18:22,077 --> 01:18:24,705
- The woolly kind. A mammoth.
- Dad!

755
01:18:25,581 --> 01:18:27,291
What?

756
01:18:29,084 --> 01:18:31,545
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.

757
01:18:31,587 --> 01:18:34,089
Well, you shouldn't have started
with a question...

758
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:36,300
...because people
want to answer questions.

759
01:18:36,592 --> 01:18:40,220
You should've started with,
"The thing about icebergs is..."

760
01:18:40,596 --> 01:18:43,891
Okay, okay. The thing about
icebergs is you only see 10 percent.

761
01:18:44,099 --> 01:18:47,561
The other 90 percent is below
the water where you can't see it.

762
01:18:47,603 --> 01:18:49,605
And that's...

763
01:18:49,605 --> 01:18:52,399
...what it is with you, Dad.

764
01:18:52,608 --> 01:18:55,360
I am only seeing this little bit...

765
01:18:55,611 --> 01:18:57,446
...that sticks above the water.

766
01:18:57,613 --> 01:19:00,699
Oh, you're only seeing down
to my nose? My chin? My...

767
01:19:01,116 --> 01:19:04,036
Dad, I have no idea who you are...

768
01:19:04,119 --> 01:19:07,247
...because you've never told me
a single fact.

769
01:19:07,623 --> 01:19:11,835
I've told you a thousand facts, Will.
That's what I do, I tell stories!

770
01:19:11,627 --> 01:19:15,088
You tell... lies, Dad.

771
01:19:15,631 --> 01:19:16,840
You tell amusing lies.

772
01:19:16,632 --> 01:19:19,676
Stories are what you tell
a 5-year-old at bedtime.

773
01:19:20,135 --> 01:19:22,804
They're not elaborate mythologies
that you maintain...

774
01:19:23,639 --> 01:19:25,724
...when your son is 10 and 15
and 20 and 30.

775
01:19:25,641 --> 01:19:28,519
And I believed you.

776
01:19:30,646 --> 01:19:33,982
I believed your stories
so much longer than I should have.

777
01:19:34,149 --> 01:19:37,194
Then when I realized
everything you said was impossible...

778
01:19:37,152 --> 01:19:39,279
...I felt like a fool
to have trusted you.

779
01:19:39,655 --> 01:19:41,823
You're like Santa Claus
and the Easter Bunny.

780
01:19:42,157 --> 01:19:43,992
Just as charming and just as fake.

781
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:46,495
You think I'm fake.

782
01:19:47,663 --> 01:19:51,750
Only on the surface, Dad.
But it's all I've ever seen.

783
01:19:53,669 --> 01:19:55,379
Look.

784
01:19:56,672 --> 01:19:59,174
I'm about to have...

785
01:19:59,675 --> 01:20:00,801
...a kid of my own.

786
01:20:01,176 --> 01:20:03,720
It would kill me
if he went through his whole life...

787
01:20:04,179 --> 01:20:06,306
...never understanding me.

788
01:20:06,682 --> 01:20:08,976
It would kill you, huh?

789
01:20:10,686 --> 01:20:14,273
What do you want, Will?
Who do you want me to be?

790
01:20:14,690 --> 01:20:16,400
Just yourself.

791
01:20:16,191 --> 01:20:19,820
Good, bad, everything.
Just show me who you are for once.

792
01:20:20,195 --> 01:20:23,240
I've been nothing but myself
since the day I was born.

793
01:20:23,699 --> 01:20:28,120
And if you can't see that,
it's your failing, not mine!

794
01:20:59,234 --> 01:21:03,697
Your father decided
that he needed to have an office...

795
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:07,618
...and, of course, it wouldn't do
to have it in the house.

796
01:21:07,743 --> 01:21:09,119
So...

797
01:21:10,746 --> 01:21:15,417
You'll know better than me
what's important.

798
01:21:25,761 --> 01:21:27,846
What is it?

799
01:21:29,264 --> 01:21:31,225
It was during the war.

800
01:21:31,266 --> 01:21:35,145
Your father went missing.
They thought he was dead.

801
01:21:36,271 --> 01:21:38,565
Oh, that really happened?

802
01:21:38,774 --> 01:21:42,569
Not everything your father says
is a complete fabrication.

803
01:21:44,279 --> 01:21:47,241
I think I'll go check on him.

804
01:21:49,785 --> 01:21:51,787
I need to lie down for a bit.

805
01:21:52,287 --> 01:21:54,915
Okay, go.

806
01:22:09,805 --> 01:22:14,726
After the war, the sons of Alabama
returned home, looking for work.

807
01:22:14,810 --> 01:22:16,603
Each had the advantage over me.

808
01:22:16,311 --> 01:22:19,773
They were alive,
while I was officially deceased.

809
01:22:20,315 --> 01:22:22,109
With my prospects few...

810
01:22:22,317 --> 01:22:26,113
...I took a job as a traveling salesman.
It suited me.

811
01:22:25,821 --> 01:22:28,907
If there was one thing
you can say about Edward Bloom...

812
01:22:29,324 --> 01:22:31,451
...it's that I am a social person.

813
01:22:32,828 --> 01:22:35,873
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

814
01:22:36,331 --> 01:22:38,792
I could be gone
for weeks at a time.

815
01:22:39,334 --> 01:22:42,254
But every other Friday,
I put all the money I made...

816
01:22:42,337 --> 01:22:45,799
...into an account set aside
for a proper house...

817
01:22:45,841 --> 01:22:48,177
...with a white picket fence.

818
01:22:53,849 --> 01:22:57,436
I'd like a moment of your time
to tell you about my new product...

819
01:22:57,853 --> 01:23:00,105
...the Handi-matic.

820
01:23:15,871 --> 01:23:19,082
A few years later, I added
other products and other cities...

821
01:23:18,874 --> 01:23:22,461
...until my territory stretched from
the coast to western Texas.

822
01:23:47,402 --> 01:23:48,779
Edward?

823
01:23:48,904 --> 01:23:50,572
Edward Bloom!

824
01:23:50,906 --> 01:23:52,574
It's me, Norther Winslow.

825
01:23:52,908 --> 01:23:54,785
I don't believe it.

826
01:23:54,910 --> 01:23:59,122
I was astonished to see the greatest
poet of both Ashton and Spectre...

827
01:23:59,414 --> 01:24:01,291
...all the way out in Texas.

828
01:24:01,416 --> 01:24:05,295
I want you to know, when you left
Spectre, it opened my eyes.

829
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:08,924
There was a whole life out there
that I was not living.

830
01:24:08,924 --> 01:24:10,467
So I traveled.

831
01:24:10,926 --> 01:24:14,012
I saw France, Africa,
half of South America.

832
01:24:13,929 --> 01:24:16,598
Every day, a new adventure.
That's my motto.

833
01:24:16,932 --> 01:24:19,017
That's great, Norther.
I'm happy for you.

834
01:24:19,434 --> 01:24:21,812
What are you doing now?

835
01:24:22,938 --> 01:24:24,398
I'm robbing this place.

836
01:24:28,443 --> 01:24:30,195
All right, everybody down!

837
01:24:31,947 --> 01:24:35,158
Hey!
Just slide that over.

838
01:24:41,456 --> 01:24:44,251
- Would you mind grabbing that?
- What?

839
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:45,836
The gun.

840
01:24:47,963 --> 01:24:49,798
I'm gonna be cleaning out
the cash drawers...

841
01:24:49,965 --> 01:24:54,094
...and my associate here
is gonna handle the vault.

842
01:25:00,475 --> 01:25:03,979
All right, you!
You help my friend, okay?

843
01:25:04,479 --> 01:25:06,023
Let's go!

844
01:25:26,001 --> 01:25:27,920
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I am.

845
01:25:28,003 --> 01:25:31,089
I really just don't want anyone
to get hurt.

846
01:25:31,507 --> 01:25:33,425
It's not that.

847
01:25:34,009 --> 01:25:35,969
It's just...

848
01:25:41,517 --> 01:25:42,976
There's no money.

849
01:25:44,019 --> 01:25:47,898
We're completely bankrupt.
Don't tell anybody.

850
01:25:48,023 --> 01:25:51,985
It turned out that the Savings & Loan
had already been robbed...

851
01:25:52,027 --> 01:25:56,615
...not by armed bandits, but
by speculators in Texas real estate.

852
01:25:57,032 --> 01:25:58,992
All right, let's go!

853
01:26:10,045 --> 01:26:12,047
Norther!

854
01:26:31,567 --> 01:26:34,361
Yeah! There's gotta be
close to $400 here!

855
01:26:34,570 --> 01:26:36,989
And that's just from the drawers.

856
01:26:37,072 --> 01:26:39,616
Let's see what you got
from the vault.

857
01:26:49,585 --> 01:26:52,045
This is it? The whole vault?

858
01:26:52,588 --> 01:26:55,048
I'm afraid so.

859
01:26:58,093 --> 01:26:59,761
It's got your deposit slip on it.

860
01:26:59,595 --> 01:27:01,555
Well, I just didn't want you
leaving empty-handed.

861
01:27:02,598 --> 01:27:06,185
There's something you should know.
The reason they don't have money...

862
01:27:06,602 --> 01:27:09,771
I told Norther about
the vagaries of Texas oil money...

863
01:27:10,105 --> 01:27:12,983
...and its effect on real-estate prices...

864
01:27:13,108 --> 01:27:16,195
...and how lax enforcement
of fiduciary process...

865
01:27:16,612 --> 01:27:20,407
...had made savings and loans
particularly vulnerable.

866
01:27:20,616 --> 01:27:25,412
Hearing this news,
Norther was left with one conclusion:

867
01:27:25,621 --> 01:27:29,082
I should go to Wall Street.
That's where all the money is.

868
01:27:29,124 --> 01:27:32,586
I knew then that while my days
as a criminal were over...

869
01:27:32,628 --> 01:27:33,795
Thanks for the hand!

870
01:27:34,129 --> 01:27:36,089
...Norther's were just beginning.

871
01:27:36,131 --> 01:27:38,634
When Norther made
his first million dollars...

872
01:27:38,634 --> 01:27:40,844
...he sent me a check for 10,000.

873
01:27:41,136 --> 01:27:45,182
I protested, but he said it was my fee
as his career advisor.

874
01:27:45,641 --> 01:27:49,061
It was enough to buy my wife
a proper house...

875
01:27:49,144 --> 01:27:51,104
...with a white picket fence.

876
01:27:51,146 --> 01:27:55,275
And for that, it was all the riches
a man could ever want.

877
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:31,103
I was drying out.

878
01:28:32,688 --> 01:28:35,107
I see.

879
01:28:37,192 --> 01:28:41,321
I think we ought to get you
a plant mister...

880
01:28:41,196 --> 01:28:43,991
...so we can just spray you
like a fern.

881
01:29:10,225 --> 01:29:12,561
Come, now.

882
01:29:16,732 --> 01:29:20,027
I don't think I'll ever dry out.

883
01:30:18,293 --> 01:30:21,255
You carry on. I'll see...

884
01:30:26,301 --> 01:30:28,095
Hello.

885
01:30:28,303 --> 01:30:32,224
- Are you Jennifer Hill?
- I am.

886
01:30:32,307 --> 01:30:34,601
And you're Will.

887
01:30:34,810 --> 01:30:37,771
I've seen a picture of you.
That's how I recognize you.

888
01:30:40,315 --> 01:30:43,026
Listen, Kenny,
why don't we skip the lesson today?

889
01:30:43,318 --> 01:30:45,529
We can go again next week.

890
01:30:45,821 --> 01:30:47,781
Do I have to give it back to my mom?

891
01:30:48,323 --> 01:30:50,742
Well, I won't tell her if you won't.

892
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:03,255
How did you know my father?

893
01:31:04,006 --> 01:31:06,049
Well, this was on his sales route...

894
01:31:06,008 --> 01:31:10,012
...so he was through here all the time,
and everyone in town knew him.

895
01:31:10,512 --> 01:31:12,514
Were you having an affair?

896
01:31:15,017 --> 01:31:17,311
Wow. Wow, you just said it.

897
01:31:18,020 --> 01:31:21,732
I was expecting to dance
around this for another half-hour.

898
01:31:23,525 --> 01:31:26,528
I've seen him with women.
He flirts. He always has.

899
01:31:27,029 --> 01:31:31,241
And on some level,
I just presumed that he was...

900
01:31:31,033 --> 01:31:34,411
...cheating on my mom.
I just never had proof.

901
01:31:37,539 --> 01:31:39,416
Well, can I ask you a question?

902
01:31:39,541 --> 01:31:42,336
If you found this deed,
why didn't you just ask Eddie?

903
01:31:43,045 --> 01:31:45,297
Because he's dying.

904
01:31:54,556 --> 01:31:59,394
Look, I don't know how much
you want to know about any of this.

905
01:31:59,061 --> 01:32:01,104
You have one image of your father...

906
01:32:01,563 --> 01:32:03,774
...and it'd be wrong of me
to change it...

907
01:32:04,066 --> 01:32:05,651
...especially this late in the game.

908
01:32:06,068 --> 01:32:08,362
My father talked about things
he never did...

909
01:32:08,570 --> 01:32:12,157
...and I'm sure he did a lot of things
that he never talked about.

910
01:32:12,074 --> 01:32:14,034
I'm just trying to reconcile the two.

911
01:32:17,579 --> 01:32:20,666
The first thing
you have to understand...

912
01:32:21,083 --> 01:32:23,877
...is that your father
never meant to end up here.

913
01:32:24,586 --> 01:32:25,879
Yet he did.

914
01:32:26,088 --> 01:32:27,631
Twice.

915
01:32:28,090 --> 01:32:30,509
The first time, he was early.

916
01:32:31,093 --> 01:32:33,095
The second time, he was late.

917
01:32:35,097 --> 01:32:39,017
Those days, your father was working
for himself.

918
01:32:39,101 --> 01:32:42,020
If there's one thing you could
say about Edward Bloom...

919
01:32:42,604 --> 01:32:47,568
...it's that he was a social person,
and people took a liking to him.

920
01:32:47,609 --> 01:32:50,737
One night, he was returning
from three weeks on the road...

921
01:32:51,613 --> 01:32:54,658
...when he hit a thunderstorm
unlike any in his life.

922
01:34:43,225 --> 01:34:45,602
Fate has a way of circling back
on a man...

923
01:34:45,727 --> 01:34:47,771
...and taking him by surprise.

924
01:34:52,734 --> 01:34:56,405
A man sees things differently
at different times in his life.

925
01:34:56,238 --> 01:35:00,200
This town didn't seem the same
now that he was older.

926
01:35:01,743 --> 01:35:05,330
A new road had brought
the outside world to Spectre...

927
01:35:05,247 --> 01:35:08,333
...and with it, banks, liens and debt.

928
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:13,547
Almost everywhere you looked,
people were bankrupt.

929
01:35:14,756 --> 01:35:18,051
The auction today
is for the town of Spectre.

930
01:35:18,260 --> 01:35:20,846
- The opening bid will be $ 10,000.
- So Edward Bloom...

931
01:35:21,263 --> 01:35:23,599
...decided to buy the town.
- 50,000.

932
01:35:27,769 --> 01:35:31,106
- I couldn't believe my eyes...
- He was never a wealthy man...

933
01:35:31,273 --> 01:35:36,403
...but he had made other men rich,
and now he asked for their favors.

934
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:41,241
- I'm trying to save...
- Most of them hadn't seen Spectre.

935
01:35:41,783 --> 01:35:44,953
They only had Edward's words
to describe it.

936
01:35:44,786 --> 01:35:48,165
That's all he needed.
He sold them on the dream.

937
01:35:48,790 --> 01:35:51,502
So first he bought the farms.

938
01:35:51,293 --> 01:35:55,172
Then he bought the houses.
And then he bought the stores.

939
01:35:55,797 --> 01:36:00,844
Whatever he bought, the people were
not asked to leave or pay rent.

940
01:36:01,303 --> 01:36:04,014
They were just asked to keep
doing as they were doing.

941
01:36:04,306 --> 01:36:08,268
In that way, he could make sure
the town would never die.

942
01:36:10,812 --> 01:36:16,193
Within six months, his trust had
purchased the entire town.

943
01:36:16,318 --> 01:36:18,862
With one exception.

944
01:36:43,345 --> 01:36:46,348
You must be Edward Bloom.

945
01:36:46,348 --> 01:36:47,516
How do you know?

946
01:36:48,350 --> 01:36:50,936
No one would come out here
unless they had business.

947
01:36:51,353 --> 01:36:54,189
And no one would have business
with me except for you.

948
01:36:54,356 --> 01:36:56,608
You're buying the town.

949
01:36:57,860 --> 01:37:01,864
Apparently I overlooked this one
piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that.

950
01:37:01,864 --> 01:37:06,702
In order for the town to be preserved,
the trust must own it, in its entirety.

951
01:37:06,869 --> 01:37:08,328
And so I've heard.

952
01:37:08,370 --> 01:37:11,707
I'll offer you more than it's worth.
And you won't have to move.

953
01:37:11,874 --> 01:37:15,377
Nothing will change except the name
on the deed, you have my word.

954
01:37:15,878 --> 01:37:18,589
Now, let me get this straight.

955
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:21,216
You buy the swamp from me,
but I'll stay in it?

956
01:37:21,383 --> 01:37:23,886
You'll own the house,
but it'll still be mine?

957
01:37:24,386 --> 01:37:28,223
I'll be here, and you'll come and go as
you please to one place or another.

958
01:37:28,390 --> 01:37:30,309
Do I have that right?

959
01:37:30,392 --> 01:37:32,853
In so many words, yes.

960
01:37:33,896 --> 01:37:35,856
Yeah, then I don't think so,
Mr. Bloom.

961
01:37:36,899 --> 01:37:39,860
If nothing's gonna change,
I'd just as soon it not change...

962
01:37:39,902 --> 01:37:42,863
...in the way things haven't been
changing all this time.

963
01:37:43,906 --> 01:37:48,702
It's not like you'll lose anything.
You can ask anyone in town.

964
01:37:50,412 --> 01:37:52,623
Why are you buying this land,
Mr. Bloom?

965
01:37:52,915 --> 01:37:54,499
Some sort of midlife crisis?

966
01:37:55,417 --> 01:37:57,878
Instead of buying a convertible,
you buy a town?

967
01:37:58,420 --> 01:38:00,506
Helping people makes me happy.

968
01:38:01,423 --> 01:38:04,510
I'm not convinced
you should be happy.

969
01:38:04,927 --> 01:38:08,889
- I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
- No.

970
01:38:08,931 --> 01:38:10,849
You did exactly what you promised.

971
01:38:11,433 --> 01:38:15,896
You came back.
I was just expecting you sooner.

972
01:38:23,445 --> 01:38:24,905
You're Beamen's daughter.

973
01:38:26,949 --> 01:38:29,701
Your name's different.
Did you get married?

974
01:38:30,452 --> 01:38:35,499
I was 18. He was 28.
Turns out that was a big difference.

975
01:38:44,967 --> 01:38:48,804
I won't be selling you this house,
Mr. Bloom.

976
01:38:49,471 --> 01:38:51,014
I see.

977
01:38:51,974 --> 01:38:55,394
Well, thank you for your time.

978
01:39:05,487 --> 01:39:08,574
- It's stuck.
- Yeah.

979
01:39:19,001 --> 01:39:22,045
- Oh, I'm so sorry! l...
- It's okay. Just leave it.

980
01:39:22,504 --> 01:39:24,840
- No, I'll...
- Please! Just go.

981
01:39:26,508 --> 01:39:28,802
- But...
- Go.

982
01:39:31,013 --> 01:39:35,809
Most men in that situation would
accept their failure and move on.

983
01:39:36,018 --> 01:39:38,061
But Edward was not like most men.

984
01:39:38,020 --> 01:39:38,562
But Edward was not like most men.

985
01:39:48,530 --> 01:39:49,865
Hold!

986
01:39:54,036 --> 01:39:56,163
They both had completely
different characters but...

987
01:39:57,039 --> 01:39:59,082
...well, just one pair of legs.

988
01:40:09,551 --> 01:40:12,971
As the months passed, he found
more and more things to fix...

989
01:40:13,055 --> 01:40:16,934
...until the shack no longer
resembled itself.

990
01:40:33,075 --> 01:40:37,287
Of course, the best part
was coming up with the new material.

991
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:40,624
By the time the twins and I
had got to Havana...

992
01:40:40,582 --> 01:40:46,255
...we'd worked out a new routine,
using only a ukulele and a harmonica.

993
01:41:05,607 --> 01:41:09,069
- Well...
- You could leave it there.

994
01:41:26,628 --> 01:41:28,088
No.

995
01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:40,392
Now, don't.

996
01:41:41,143 --> 01:41:45,731
Don't be embarrassed. I should never
have let you think that...

997
01:41:47,149 --> 01:41:49,276
I'm in love with my wife.

998
01:41:50,152 --> 01:41:52,112
Yeah, I know.

999
01:41:52,654 --> 01:41:55,449
And from the first day I saw her
until the day I die...

1000
01:41:55,657 --> 01:41:57,701
...she's the only one.

1001
01:41:58,660 --> 01:42:01,121
Lucky girl.

1002
01:42:01,663 --> 01:42:04,833
I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.

1003
01:42:12,174 --> 01:42:14,593
Wait! Edward.

1004
01:42:56,218 --> 01:42:59,137
One day, Edward Bloom left...

1005
01:42:59,221 --> 01:43:03,058
...and never returned
to the town he'd saved.

1006
01:43:15,737 --> 01:43:17,698
As for the girl...

1007
01:43:17,739 --> 01:43:20,242
...the common belief
was that she'd become a witch...

1008
01:43:21,243 --> 01:43:23,036
...and crazy at that.

1009
01:43:24,246 --> 01:43:27,749
She became something
of a legend herself.

1010
01:43:29,251 --> 01:43:34,006
And the story ended where it began.

1011
01:43:34,756 --> 01:43:37,801
Logically, you couldn't be
the witch, because she was...

1012
01:43:37,759 --> 01:43:38,927
...old when he was young.

1013
01:43:39,261 --> 01:43:42,556
Well, it's logical if you think
like your father.

1014
01:43:43,265 --> 01:43:47,144
See, to him there's only
two women:

1015
01:43:47,769 --> 01:43:49,229
Your mother...

1016
01:43:49,271 --> 01:43:50,939
...and everyone else.

1017
01:43:50,772 --> 01:43:52,649
And one day...

1018
01:43:53,275 --> 01:43:57,613
...I realized I was in love with a man
who could never love me back.

1019
01:43:58,280 --> 01:44:01,241
I was living in a fairy tale.

1020
01:44:01,783 --> 01:44:04,036
I'm not sure I should've told you
any of this.

1021
01:44:04,286 --> 01:44:06,872
No, no, no, I wanted to know. I'm...

1022
01:44:07,289 --> 01:44:08,624
I'm glad I know.

1023
01:44:09,291 --> 01:44:12,544
I wanted to be as important to him
as you were.

1024
01:44:13,295 --> 01:44:15,088
And I'm...

1025
01:44:15,297 --> 01:44:17,716
I was never gonna be.

1026
01:44:20,302 --> 01:44:21,887
I was make-believe.

1027
01:44:23,305 --> 01:44:28,227
And his other life, you...

1028
01:44:28,310 --> 01:44:29,895
You were real.

1029
01:44:54,336 --> 01:44:55,963
Mom?

1030
01:44:56,839 --> 01:44:58,674
Josephine?

1031
01:45:00,843 --> 01:45:02,261
Josephine?

1032
01:45:16,358 --> 01:45:18,402
Will!

1033
01:45:19,361 --> 01:45:20,737
What happened?

1034
01:45:20,863 --> 01:45:22,447
Your father had a stroke.

1035
01:45:23,365 --> 01:45:25,951
He's upstairs with your mom
and Dr. Bennett.

1036
01:45:25,868 --> 01:45:27,119
Is he gonna be okay?

1037
01:45:35,377 --> 01:45:37,421
I don't suppose that I could...

1038
01:45:37,379 --> 01:45:39,923
...stay here with him.
I mean, in case...

1039
01:45:40,883 --> 01:45:43,802
In case he wakes up,
I really ought to be here.

1040
01:45:43,886 --> 01:45:45,095
I'll stay.

1041
01:45:46,388 --> 01:45:49,349
Why don't you go home with
Josephine. I'll stay tonight.

1042
01:45:51,393 --> 01:45:54,354
- Is that okay?
- Fine.

1043
01:45:56,899 --> 01:45:59,818
Will, you'll call if there's any...?

1044
01:46:00,402 --> 01:46:03,488
I will. I will. I'll call.

1045
01:46:04,907 --> 01:46:08,869
- Do you want some time with Dad?
- Yes. Thank you.

1046
01:47:12,975 --> 01:47:16,395
Glad to see you're not trying
to have a heartfelt talk.

1047
01:47:19,481 --> 01:47:22,067
One of my greatest
annoyances is when...

1048
01:47:22,484 --> 01:47:25,404
...people try to talk to those
who can't hear them.

1049
01:47:25,487 --> 01:47:27,573
Well, we have an advantage.

1050
01:47:27,990 --> 01:47:30,075
My father and I never talk.

1051
01:47:36,999 --> 01:47:40,085
Your father ever tell you
about the day you were born?

1052
01:47:40,002 --> 01:47:43,297
Yeah, a thousand times.
He caught an uncatchable fish.

1053
01:47:43,505 --> 01:47:47,467
Not that. The real story.
He ever tell you that?

1054
01:47:48,010 --> 01:47:49,636
No.

1055
01:47:50,012 --> 01:47:53,348
Well, your mother came in about
3 in the afternoon.

1056
01:47:53,515 --> 01:47:58,187
Her neighbor drove her, on account of
your father was away on business...

1057
01:47:58,020 --> 01:47:59,479
...in Wichita.

1058
01:48:00,522 --> 01:48:04,276
You were born a week early,
but there were no complications.

1059
01:48:04,526 --> 01:48:10,240
It was a perfect delivery.
Your father was sorry not to be there.

1060
01:48:10,532 --> 01:48:15,287
But it wasn't the custom then for men
to be in the room for deliveries...

1061
01:48:15,537 --> 01:48:19,708
...so I can't see how it would've been
much different had he been there.

1062
01:48:20,042 --> 01:48:22,628
And that's the real story
of how you were born.

1063
01:48:23,545 --> 01:48:25,839
Not very exciting, is it?

1064
01:48:26,048 --> 01:48:29,927
And I suppose if I had to choose
between the true version...

1065
01:48:30,052 --> 01:48:34,473
...and an elaborate one involving
a fish and a wedding ring...

1066
01:48:34,556 --> 01:48:36,517
...I might choose the fancy version.

1067
01:48:37,559 --> 01:48:39,520
But, then that's just me.

1068
01:48:40,562 --> 01:48:42,564
I kind of liked your version.

1069
01:49:04,586 --> 01:49:06,213
Dad?

1070
01:49:08,090 --> 01:49:11,552
Hey, Dad? Hey, you want me
to get the nurse?

1071
01:49:13,595 --> 01:49:16,640
What do you want? What can I do?
What can I get?

1072
01:49:17,099 --> 01:49:19,476
You want some water?

1073
01:49:20,102 --> 01:49:21,520
You want a bit of water?

1074
01:49:24,606 --> 01:49:27,359
The river.

1075
01:49:28,610 --> 01:49:30,487
The river?

1076
01:49:31,113 --> 01:49:35,200
Tell me how it happens.

1077
01:49:37,119 --> 01:49:39,997
How what happens?

1078
01:49:40,122 --> 01:49:42,457
How I go.

1079
01:49:46,628 --> 01:49:49,173
You mean what you saw in The Eye?

1080
01:50:03,145 --> 01:50:06,398
I don't know that story, Dad.
You never told me that one.

1081
01:50:09,651 --> 01:50:12,654
Okay. Hey, okay, I'll try.

1082
01:50:12,654 --> 01:50:15,282
I need your help.
Tell me how it starts.

1083
01:50:17,659 --> 01:50:21,330
Like this.

1084
01:50:21,663 --> 01:50:23,665
Okay. Okay.

1085
01:50:26,168 --> 01:50:29,505
Okay, so it's in the morning...

1086
01:50:29,671 --> 01:50:33,717
...and you and I are in the hospital,
and I've fallen asleep. And I wake up...

1087
01:50:34,176 --> 01:50:37,471
...and I see you,
and somehow you're better.

1088
01:50:38,180 --> 01:50:39,348
Dad?

1089
01:50:39,181 --> 01:50:41,141
You're different.

1090
01:50:42,184 --> 01:50:45,145
- Dad.
- Let's get out of here.

1091
01:50:45,187 --> 01:50:46,396
Then I say:

1092
01:50:46,688 --> 01:50:48,190
Dad, you're in no condition...

1093
01:50:48,190 --> 01:50:50,484
Get that wheelchair.

1094
01:50:53,195 --> 01:50:55,239
Hurry up! We haven't much time!

1095
01:50:55,197 --> 01:50:57,491
Once we get off this floor,
we're in the clear.

1096
01:50:57,699 --> 01:50:59,409
And we get in the wheelchair...

1097
01:50:59,701 --> 01:51:03,163
- Faster!
...like we're escaping the hospital.

1098
01:51:03,205 --> 01:51:05,165
What are you doing?

1099
01:51:05,207 --> 01:51:07,417
We pass Dr. Bennett,
who tries to slow us down.

1100
01:51:07,709 --> 01:51:10,671
- Stop them!
- We're flying down the hall.

1101
01:51:10,712 --> 01:51:12,673
Orderly after orderly is chasing us.

1102
01:51:13,215 --> 01:51:15,133
Mom and Josephine
are at the end.

1103
01:51:15,217 --> 01:51:18,178
No time to explain! Stall them!

1104
01:51:23,725 --> 01:51:25,686
We come flying out
over the curb...

1105
01:51:25,727 --> 01:51:30,190
...and your old red Charger is there.
But it's new. Brand-new.

1106
01:51:30,732 --> 01:51:32,985
And I pick you up...

1107
01:51:32,734 --> 01:51:36,405
...and somehow you hardly weigh
anything. I can't explain it.

1108
01:51:40,742 --> 01:51:43,495
Leave it! We don't need it!

1109
01:51:45,747 --> 01:51:48,208
Water. I need water.

1110
01:51:51,253 --> 01:51:53,213
- Where are we going?
- The river.

1111
01:52:00,262 --> 01:52:02,639
And we have to take Glenville
to avoid traffic...

1112
01:52:02,764 --> 01:52:05,559
...because the damn church
people drive too slow.

1113
01:52:46,808 --> 01:52:51,980
And as we get close to the river...

1114
01:53:00,322 --> 01:53:02,449
He's here!

1115
01:53:02,824 --> 01:53:05,661
...we see that everybody
is already there.

1116
01:53:22,344 --> 01:53:23,804
And I mean...

1117
01:53:25,347 --> 01:53:26,515
...everyone.

1118
01:53:38,861 --> 01:53:41,613
It's unbelievable.

1119
01:53:42,364 --> 01:53:47,119
The story of my life.

1120
01:53:54,877 --> 01:53:57,796
The strange thing is, there's
not a sad face to be found.

1121
01:53:57,880 --> 01:54:00,465
Everyone is just so glad
to see you...

1122
01:54:01,884 --> 01:54:04,094
...and send you off right.

1123
01:54:03,886 --> 01:54:09,516
Goodbye, everybody!
Farewell! Adieu!

1124
01:54:20,903 --> 01:54:23,488
My girl in the river.

1125
01:55:34,977 --> 01:55:37,813
You become what you always were.

1126
01:55:39,481 --> 01:55:41,775
A very big fish.

1127
01:55:46,989 --> 01:55:49,408
And that's how it happens.

1128
01:55:50,993 --> 01:55:52,786
Yeah.

1129
01:55:55,497 --> 01:55:57,666
Exactly.

1130
01:56:40,042 --> 01:56:41,752
Mom?

1131
01:58:08,630 --> 01:58:11,800
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not be in want.

1132
01:58:12,134 --> 01:58:15,888
He makes me to lie down
in green pastures.

1133
01:58:15,637 --> 01:58:18,557
He leads me beside the quiet waters.

1134
01:58:18,640 --> 01:58:20,601
He restores my soul.

1135
01:58:21,143 --> 01:58:25,105
He guides me in the paths of
righteousness for his name's sake.

1136
01:58:25,647 --> 01:58:28,817
Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

1137
01:58:29,151 --> 01:58:31,820
...I will fear no evil,
for you are with me.

1138
01:58:31,653 --> 01:58:35,908
Surely goodness and love will
follow me all the days of my life.

1139
01:59:23,205 --> 01:59:27,835
Have you ever heard a joke so many
times you've forgotten why it's funny?

1140
01:59:27,709 --> 01:59:31,713
And then you hear it again
and suddenly it's new.

1141
01:59:32,214 --> 01:59:35,300
You remember why you loved it
in the first place.

1142
01:59:37,219 --> 01:59:40,305
So he said he'll fight the giant
who was 15 feet tall!

1143
01:59:40,222 --> 01:59:43,684
- No way!
- Dad! That's right, isn't it?

1144
01:59:44,226 --> 01:59:45,477
Pretty much.

1145
01:59:45,727 --> 01:59:47,855
See? So he was a giant.

1146
01:59:47,729 --> 01:59:50,107
That was my father's final joke,
I guess.

1147
01:59:50,732 --> 01:59:56,488
A man tells his stories so many times
that he becomes the stories.

1148
01:59:57,739 --> 01:59:59,992
They live on after him.

1149
02:00:02,744 --> 02:00:05,998
And in that way,
he becomes immortal.
