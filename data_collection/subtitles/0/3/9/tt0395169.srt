1
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,560
The latest ceasefire came too late
to save these villages...

2
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:26,640
Today President Clinton voiced concerns
at the deteriorating situation in Sarajevo...

3
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,280
When people ask me, good listeners,
why do I hate all the Tutsi.

4
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,080
I say, "Read our history. "

5
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,960
The Tutsi were collaborators
for the Belgian colonists.

6
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,920
They stole our Hutu land,
they whipped us.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,880
Now they have come back,
these Tutsi rebels.

8
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,120
They are cockroaches.
They are murderers.

9
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,600
Rwanda is our Hutu land.
We are the majority.

10
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,040
They are a minority of traitors
and invaders.

11
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,720
We will squash the infestation.
We will wipe out the RPF rebels.

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,080
This is RTLM, Hutu Power Radio.

13
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,200
Stay alert.
Watch your neighbors.

14
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,200
- Mr. Rusesabagina, thank you.
- Good to see you, sir.

15
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,880
Thank you.

16
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,280
These are for you, sir.
They're fresh from Havana.

17
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,160
Wonderful. Next time you are there.
tell Fidel that I said hello.

18
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,360
Good to see you gentlemen.

19
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,360
That is a fine cigar, sir.

20
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,680
This is a Cohiba cigar.

21
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,520
Each one is worth 10,000 francs.

22
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,720
Yes, yes. But it is worth
more to me than 10,000 francs.

23
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,400
What do you mean, sir?

24
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,840
If I give a businessman 10,000 francs.
what does that matter to him?

25
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,680
He is rich.
But if I give him a Cohiba cigar

26
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,320
straight from Havana, Cuba
Hey, that is style, Dube.

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,080
Style.

28
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,520
Cohiba--a fantastic cigar.

29
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,640
The best, eh?

30
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,200
So, you're going to join us
at the rally today?

31
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,960
I will try my best, George.

32
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,480
but these days I have no time
for rallies and politics.

33
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,920
Politics is power, Paul.
Hutu power.

34
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,200
And money.

35
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,480
It's time for you
to join your people.

36
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,200
Thank you, George.

37
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,000
But time is also money.

38
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,960
I need six extra cases
of beer today.

39
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,840
along with the regular order.

40
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,320
- Business is good at the hotel.
- It is very good.

41
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,440
I'm always glad
to see you, Paul.

42
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,400
Put that back! Put that back!
That's not beer!

43
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,920
- You, clean this up.
- Yes, sir. Come on.

44
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,560
Paul, don't worry
about the Carlsberg.

45
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,240
I'll give you Heineken.
and I won't charge you extra.

46
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,320
Thank you.

47
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,080
A bargain buy from China--
ten cents each.

48
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,400
You know, I'll get at least fifty.

49
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,240
At least.

50
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,800
George Rutaganda is a bad man.

51
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,560
I've heard him on the radio
telling the Hutus to kill all the Tutsis.

52
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,840
Rutaganda and his people.
they are fools, Dube.

53
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,120
Their time is soon over.

54
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,120
Anyway, this is business.

55
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,280
Oh, no. It's the Interhamwe.

56
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,640
No, no, sit up, Dube. Sit up.

57
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,640
Smile, Dube. Don't attract

58
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,480
Some of these men are my neighbors.
They know that I'm Tutsi.

59
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,920
Just smile as if
they are friends, Dube.

60
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,000
- I know this man!
- Are you a Tutsi?

61
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,320
What are you doing here?

62
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,880
No, no. Hutu power.
Hutu power. Hutu power!

63
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,880
Okay. Yes!

64
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,400
Get out of here.

65
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,240
There's water coming from the box.

66
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,400
Park here.
We'll go in the front.

67
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,840
Gregoire, please help with this water.

68
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,200
Gregoire!

69
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,880
Deal with this right away.

70
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,920
- We were hoping to go see the gorilla.
- You must contact our safari desk.

71
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,760
Dube, this is the lobby.

72
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,280
- What's going on?
- I am sorry, sir. It is an emergency.

73
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,080
Oh, shit! Oh, sorry, sir.

74
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,440
Ten alive, twelve are dead.

75
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,040
All right.

76
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,720
But save the shells.

77
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,200
Fill them with...

78
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,200
a stuffing.
The good meat and something local.

79
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,880
- Cassava?
- And the fish.

80
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,960
- And tipali.
- Yes.

81
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,720
We'll call it "fresh lobster
in a cassava and tipali crust,"

82
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,760
Dube.

83
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,160
Style, sir.

84
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,640
Yes, sir.

85
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,280
The problem is, General Bizimungu.
I have information

86
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,280
that the Interhamwe militia
will not heed the peace agreement.

87
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,840
Colonel, the U.N. need not worry
about the Interhamwe.

88
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,000
We will control them.

89
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,240
- General.
- Paul.

90
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,320
This scotch is exceptional.

91
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,000
It is our most popular single malt.
I knew you'd like it.

92
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,840
Colonel Oliver.

93
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,840
Good to see you, Paul.

94
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,280
General, let me recommend

95
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,200
It is spectacular--
straight off the plane.

96
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,080
Fresh lobster in Kigali.
You do us proud, Paul.

97
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,040
Thank you.

98
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,920
I left a little something for you
at the coat check.

99
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,360
Excuse me, gentlemen.

100
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,600
I need flour.
Give me two bags of flour.

101
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,080
Okay, the plates are ready.
Here they come.

102
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,000
Good afternoon, ladies.

103
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,560
Elizabeth, please put these
in the general's briefcase.

104
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,840
Yes, sir.

105
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,040
This is RTLM. Hutu Power Radio.

106
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,400
I have a message for our president.

107
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,160
Beware. Do not trust
the Tutsi rebels.

108
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,640
Do not shake the hand
that will stab you.

109
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,920
They will treat you...

110
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,600
... reporting from Kigali, Rwanda.
where tensions are high

111
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,680
as the deadline for the U. N.-brokered
peace agreement approaches.

112
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,200
Hello, Mr. Paul.

113
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,920
Hello, Jeremiah.

114
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,440
Hello, sir.

115
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,600
- Good to see you, Paul.
- Odette.

116
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,760
See you soon.

117
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,600
So your brother
and the girls are here.

118
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,800
Yes.

119
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,000
One, two, three

120
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,840
Oh, Carine!

121
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,360
Okay, Anais, let me see.
Your turn.

122
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,840
One, two, three

123
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,560
Who is the winner?
Oh, it doesn't matter.

124
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,360
I have chocolates.
Who wants chocolates?

125
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,520
Hey, Papa, watch this.

126
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,680
Oh, my goodness. Well, here.
chocolates, chocolates. Who wants?

127
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,320
Say thank you to your Uncle Paul.

128
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,360
- Please, not before dinner.

129
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,440
- Thank you.
- Okay, okay.

130
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,800
Let's go in.

131
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,840
Things are very slow at the shop.
How are things at the hotel?

132
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,880
Very busy.
Many people visiting the gorillas.

133
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,680
A lot of foreign press arriving
for the peace acc--

134
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,120
- What?
- There are soldiers.

135
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,600
- Where?
- On the street.

136
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,240
I'll go see what's happening.
It's all right.

137
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,960
- We know you are Tutsi.
- Please, sir, this is my husband.

138
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,360
- He's just a gardener.
- He's been spying for the rebels.

139
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,040
- No, we do not know any rebels.
- You will come with us!

140
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,040
No, we are telling the truth.
We do not know any

141
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,160
- What is it?
- Shut up!

142
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,800
Tatiana, go back in the house.
You must go back.

143
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,800
- You mustn't be out here.
- It's Victor.

144
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,520
No, Captain, you see--

145
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,560
It's not me. It's not me.
Captain. Captain.

146
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,040
Why are you taking him away?
Please, please.

147
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,520
- I know, I know, but it's not me.

148
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,080
No! No!

149
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,360
We must do something.

150
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,120
- Do what?
- Call someone.

151
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,920
I'm not going. I'm not going.

152
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,960
No!

153
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,880
Get him in the truck. Now!

154
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,480
We must do something.

155
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,560
Please help him!

156
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,040
Oh, Victor!

157
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,520
Victor!

158
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,320
There is nothing we can do.

159
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,000
- You must stay the night, Thomas.
- Yes.

160
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,640
No!

161
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,400
Why would they arrest Victor?

162
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,400
He has no politics.

163
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,760
- He's a gardener.
- Who knows, Tatsi?

164
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,080
Who knows?

165
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,840
Someone who didn't like him
denounced him as a rebel spy.

166
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,800
Happens all the time now.

167
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,520
Maybe you could call
one of your contacts in the army.

168
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,640
It wouldn't help.

169
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,880
You could ask as a favor.

170
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,040
No, I could not.

171
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,000
Tatsi, all day long I work
to please this officer.

172
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,760
that diplomat, some tourist.
to store up favors

173
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,320
so if there is a time
when we need help.

174
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,320
I have powerful people
I can call upon.

175
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,640
But Victor was a good neighbor.

176
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,880
He is not family.
Family is all that matters.

177
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:49,520
Please, please.
leave these things to my good judgment.

178
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,960
This assignment is bullshit.

179
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,920
Come on. A few days in a nice hotel.
no one shooting at us?

180
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,320
Gentlemen, welcome

181
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,560
I am Paul Rusesabagina.
the house manager.

182
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,400
- How you doing?
- Nice to meet you.

183
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,600
Anything that you need.
please find me.

184
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,920
- Thank you.
- Certainly.

185
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,120
So, what is the actual difference

186
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,440
According to the Belgian colonists.
the Tutsis are taller and more elegant.

187
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,320
It was the Belgians
that created the division.

188
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,800
How?

189
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,120
They picked people.
those with thinner noses, lighter skin.

190
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,120
They used to measure
the width of people's noses.

191
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,640
The Belgians used the Tutsis
to run the country.

192
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,000
Then when they left.
they left the power to the Hutus.

193
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,160
and of course the Hutus
took revenge

194
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,360
on the elite Tutsis
for years of repression.

195
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,200
Am I telling the truth, Paul?

196
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,480
Yes, unfortunately.
Please take this to the general.

197
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,680
Benedict is our finest journalist
in Kigali, an expert on the subject.

198
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,600
So what are you, Paul?

199
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,400
I am Hutu.

200
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,360
Gentlemen.

201
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,760
- More champagne?
- More champagne would be nice.

202
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,000
Excuse me, honey.
Can I ask you a personal question?

203
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,360
- Are you a Hutu or a Tutsi?
- I am Tutsi.

204
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,080
- And your friend? Tutsi?
- No, I am Hutu.

205
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,040
They could be twins.

206
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,600
Get the camera.
The general's going to give us an interview.

207
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,560
Okay.

208
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,680
I'm in room 22, I'd love
to finish up this conversation.

209
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,320
Senior U.N. officers claim that
the Rwandan army is secretly training

210
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,520
and arming the Hutu militia
called the Interhamwe.

211
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,800
I put this claim to the head
of the armed forces, General Bizimungu.

212
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,480
No. No, we have not been
training the militia.

213
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,480
The U. N. are mistaken
in this accusation.

214
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,000
Do you support your president's
agreement to make peace with the rebels?

215
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,400
The president has
the full support of the army.

216
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,400
That peace agreement will
be signed today in Tanzania

217
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,680
between Tutsi rebel forces
and President Habyarimana.

218
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,360
This is a great day for Rwanda

219
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,280
and for all of Africa.

220
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,920
Negotiation has replaced confrontation...

221
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,400
Paul, have a drink.

222
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,240
Friendship has replaced fear.

223
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,400
Ladies and gentlemen.
we have a live feed

224
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,280
to the signing
of the peace agreement.

225
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,680
To our president.
May he find peace.

226
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,320
May we all find peace.

227
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,800
Let us all dedicate ourselves
to nurturing this hard-earned accord.

228
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,120
To peace!

229
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,240
Peace!

230
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,640
- Look me up if you come over.
- Yes, it is a beautiful city.

231
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,120
I am planning on returning there as--
Forgive me.

232
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,280
- Thank you. Bye.
- Thomas.

233
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,120
- Hello, Fedens.

234
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,360
Well, this is a surprise.

235
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,760
Forgive us, Paul.
We must talk.

236
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,400
Yes, what's wrong?

237
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,200
I have it from a very
reliable source, Paul.

238
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,360
Who?

239
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,120
Thank you, Sullivan.

240
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,640
My assistant.
the Hutu Power man.

241
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,600
He says that we must get out now.
that soon it'll be very bad.

242
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,040
Give me this man's name.

243
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,600
Please, Paul, even though
he is Interhamwe, he's a friend.

244
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,400
He wants your job, Thomas.

245
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,360
He said that
there is a signal.

246
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,880
It is "Cut the tall trees,"

247
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,640
And when they hear this signal.
the militia are to go to war.

248
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,480
Paul, please, let us
take Tatiana with us.

249
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,400
You are Hutu.
You will be safe.

250
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,280
Fedens, I know you
have heard many things.

251
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,160
And I know
what we have seen, Thomas.

252
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,880
But please, the United Nations
are here now.

253
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,400
The world press are watching.

254
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,120
The peace has been signed.
Let this process work--

255
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,680
What was that?

256
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,120
Power cuts.

257
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,400
We are running on generators.

258
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,280
Fedens...

259
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,880
Please, don't worry.

260
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,560
Tomorrow you will come by the house
and we will discuss this with Tatiana.

261
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,920
All right?

262
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,320
- Good night, Paul.
- Yes. Kiss the girls for me.

263
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,960
Shit!

264
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,320
Stay in your houses.
Stay in your house.

265
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,520
Everybody stay in your house!

266
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,960
Tatiana?

267
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,760
- Paul!
- Tatiana!

268
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,840
- What is going on here?
- Our house has been burned.

269
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,640
- Didn't you hear the news?
- What news?

270
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,920
They are saying President Habyarimana
has been murdered.

271
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,720
Tutsi rebels have killed him.

272
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,000
Nonsense. Why would the rebels kill
the president when he agreed to peace?

273
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,760
Everyone, please.
out of this room. Please.

274
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,800
Jean Baptiste, find them seats
in the other room.

275
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,600
Odette, please.

276
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,720
- Did you meet with Thomas and Fedens?
- Yes, I told them to go home.

277
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,240
- Go and call them, Tatsi.

278
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,200
- Why do the neighbors run to us?
- You are the only Hutu they can trust.

279
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,800
You are a Tutsi.

280
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,000
They are scared, Paul.
I am scared.

281
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,840
These are probably rumors
started by agitators.

282
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,600
We must remain calm
for the children, Tatsi. We must.

283
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,480
Forgive me, Paul.
Elys says that Roger has gone.

284
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,720
Gone? Gone where?

285
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,320
- He was afraid for his friend Simon, Mama.

286
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,440
He went next door.

287
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,080
Wait, Paul!

288
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,120
Tatiana, no, You have to

289
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,960
- Stay in the house, No!
- Please.

290
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,800
Paul, please, what is wrong?
Tell me, what is wrong?

291
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,800
- Oh, my son! Where are you hurt?
- Is he okay? Oh, my baby!

292
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,880
Talk to me.
Where are you hurt?

293
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,000
Paul?

294
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,680
Oh, Tatsi.

295
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,800
Odette, Odette!

296
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,840
Oh, no.

297
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,320
I'm okay.

298
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,680
Get his clothes off.
Tatsi, please get some water.

299
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,840
- He's hurt.
- Please, let's get his clothes off.

300
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,240
- He's covered in blood.
- Lay back, son.

301
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,840
He went next door
to the Chirangas.

302
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,400
Where is he hurt?

303
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,880
Look here, Odette, look here.

304
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,520
Stay still, Roger.
Keep him still, Paul.

305
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,800
- I can't find the wound.
- What happened to you?

306
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,280
- Tell your mother.
- Talk to me.

307
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,360
Tell your mother
what happened, Roger.

308
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,840
Roger, you're okay.

309
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,520
Do not worry, he is not cut.
He is not hurt.

310
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,960
This is not his blood, Paul.

311
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,480
You are not hurt.

312
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,880
My darling, it's okay.
It's okay.

313
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,720
You are safe.
Look at your mother.

314
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,760
Come here, Elys.

315
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,200
- Where did the blood come from?
- Please, please!

316
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,920
- You are safe.
- You are out, Roger.

317
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,640
You are safe, you are safe, Roger.
You are safe, Roger.

318
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,240
It's okay.

319
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,480
I love you so much.
I love you.

320
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,760
Oh, son.

321
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,440
Paul.

322
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:35,720
Listen to me, good people of Rwanda.
Terrible news...

323
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,680
- It is true.
- Horrible news...

324
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,320
Our great president
is murdered by the Tutsi cockroaches.

325
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,280
Oh, my God!

326
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,040
They tricked him to sign
their phony peace agreement.

327
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,640
Then they shot his plane
from the sky.

328
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,800
It is time to clear the brush.
good Hutus of Rwanda.

329
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,560
We must cut the tall trees.

330
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,880
cut the tall trees now!

331
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,440
The soldiers are here!

332
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,320
- Let us go to work, loyal Hutus.
- No, no.

333
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,840
Everyone, stay calm.
Stay calm and be quiet.

334
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:14,160
Find these traitors.
Let none of them escape.

335
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,680
Split up.
Everybody out.

336
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,080
- You two, check the back.

337
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,000
- You, go and find him.
- Yes, sir.

338
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,880
I better go have a word with them.

339
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,800
Go around the back.
Make sure no one comes out.

340
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,880
Yes, sir!

341
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,440
Who's in charge here?

342
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,680
You.

343
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,120
- Can I help you, sir?
- Everybody out! Out!

344
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,000
- Let me see your identity card.
- Grab your things. Go!

345
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,000
I am a good friend
of General Bizimungu.

346
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,120
Get out!

347
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,480
Get out of here!

348
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,800
Everybody, out!
Get out, get out!

349
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,400
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?

350
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,520
No, I work at the Mille Collines.

351
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,960
I used to work at the Diplomat.

352
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,600
We want to use that hotel.
All the room keys are in the safe.

353
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,960
You must open it.
Let's go.

354
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,440
- Paul!
- Sir, I cannot leave my family.

355
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,160
I must take them with me.
It is not safe here.

356
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,280
There are Tutsi spies everywhere.

357
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,920
I cannot take all these people.

358
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,880
No, no, sir.

359
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,680
We have our car
and our van.

360
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,320
- Captain Kaliso, come on.
- Roger.

361
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,720
- Let's go!
- Come on. Hurry! Go around, go around.

362
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,960
We found him.
Let's go. Let's go!

363
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,600
- Can I go with you?
- Yes, of course, Jeremiah. Hurry.

364
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,920
Oh, Jesus, no!

365
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,200
Oh, it's Simon, Papa!

366
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,320
Don't look, don't look, don't look.

367
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,920
- The safe is in the manager's office.
- You two, go with him.

368
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,160
Look at this. Beer.

369
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,800
I've got them.

370
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,400
Get down, all of you!

371
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,920
Sir, sir. Here, I have them.

372
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,200
Traitor!

373
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,120
These are Tutsi cockroaches!

374
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,120
Let me explain, sir.
Please wait.

375
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,360
Shoot them.

376
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,840
Shoot them.

377
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,120
Please, I don't use guns.
I don't.

378
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,120
It's easy.

379
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,080
Shoot them, or you die first.

380
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,520
Sir, what could I pay you
not to do this?

381
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,360
You wanna pay me?

382
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,720
Why not?
Look at them.

383
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,560
These are not rebels.

384
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,840
Soon they will be worthless to you.
Why not take some money for your work?

385
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,360
- How much?
- You name a price.

386
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,600
10,000 francs for each.

387
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,960
- Sir, I don't have that much.

388
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,000
Wait, wait! Here.

389
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,280
It's 1,000 U,S.

390
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,760
50,000 francs for my wife and children.

391
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,880
- Take them.
- Go, go, go.

392
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,240
Go, go, go.

393
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,160
- Have you any money?
- Nothing.

394
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,320
- Paul, don't let them die.

395
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,960
Sir, I have more money actually.

396
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,960
And let them give you something.
Some money, whatever they have.

397
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,080
All right?

398
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,680
Here you are.
Give me everything you have.

399
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,520
Here, Paul, it's all I have.

400
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,480
Here you are. See?

401
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,200
This is enough for one cockroach.
Pick one.

402
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,880
Sir...

403
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,200
I will give you 100,000 francs
for all of them.

404
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,920
- Give me it.
- I don't have it here.

405
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,960
At the Mille Collines
I can get it for you.

406
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,320
You'll run into the hotel
and hide behind the U,N.

407
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,880
Sir, I swear.

408
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,320
I will get you the money.
You keep them outside.

409
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,960
Please, sir. Please.

410
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,720
- Let's go.
- Okay. Everyone in the van.

411
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,400
Come on now. Hurry.

412
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,320
Go with my soldiers. And hurry back
if you want to keep these cockroaches.

413
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,440
The soldiers are here.
Where is the car?

414
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,720
There is nothing I can do.
Excuse me, sir! Please, could you--

415
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,920
Here's the money.

416
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,360
100,000 francs as promised.

417
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,360
Now please, let them go, sir.

418
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,520
Take the money.
We will get them later.

419
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,320
- You can go.
- Thank you.

420
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,400
Traitor.

421
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,040
Thank you, Paul.

422
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,080
Do you understand, Dube?
Because I can't wait for Paul.

423
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,320
- You must tell him when he comes--
- Here he is, sir.

424
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,760
Paul, I have to go.
The staff of Kivu Lodge have fled.

425
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,640
I have to close up there.
You are in charge now.

426
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,840
It's okay, it's okay.

427
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,480
There were no survivors in last night's
plane crash in Kigali, Rwanda.

428
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,200
Everyone, please move to the side.
Clear the door.

429
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,600
Come, Tatsi.

430
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,960
Andre, I need two suites.

431
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,320
- Paul, please, where is my passport?
- Yes, I understand.

432
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,320
- I need to get hold of my embassy.
- If you give me one moment, please.

433
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,200
- Odette, Jean Baptiste, take this room.
- What about our neighbors?

434
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,840
What will they do?

435
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,560
- Dube.
- Yes, sir?

436
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,280
Please put these "guests"
in two staff rooms.

437
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,800
Right away, sir.

438
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,160
No, no, no. Please, it's old.

439
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,480
It's all right, Roger.
It's all right. We're here.

440
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,280
- Ah, Joseph.
- Your suit, sir.

441
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,680
This mess is unacceptable.

442
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,640
Call housekeeping, get them
up here right away. Thank you.

443
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,800
- I'm trying Thomas and Fedens.
- All right.

444
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,760
Operator, I need a line.

445
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,560
I need a line now. Please. Hello?

446
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,280
You did not reach them?

447
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,440
No. No answer.

448
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,440
It is a very tense situation,
and I just want to assure the families

449
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,480
of those who are there that we are
doing everything we possibly can

450
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,000
to try to ensure
the safety of our citizens there.

451
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,200
Can you at least tell us.
is the airport actually open?

452
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,880
We are calling the airport.
We are calling the embassy.

453
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,440
We are trying to get as much
information for you as we can.

454
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,240
- And yes, your passport, yes.
- And my passport.

455
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,560
Antoinette will take care
of this for you.

456
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,720
Dube, where is Gregoire?

457
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,320
Sir, he has moved

458
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,520
Mr. Manager.

459
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,280
What do you think
you are doing, Gregoire?

460
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,680
Who is it?

461
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,880
It's okay, darling.

462
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,880
What do you want?

463
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,360
You had better get out of this room
and back downstairs right away.

464
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,520
- I don't have to listen to you anymore.
- Yes, you do.

465
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,600
I am in charge. Now get out
of this room right now.

466
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,800
Mr. Manager, do you notice
the smell of cockroaches?

467
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,240
If I were to leave this room.

468
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,320
And I know people
who can cleanse it.

469
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:37,120
But maybe it doesn't bother you.
Why is that?

470
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,280
Are you used to the smell?

471
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,960
Well, not me.

472
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,200
I need a clean room
to escape it.

473
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,840
Please move into the hotel.
Everyone, keep moving.

474
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,160
My house has been burned.
I have nowhere to go.

475
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,680
Yes, I understand this, Your Honor.

476
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,920
But we are operating
at capacity as it is.

477
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,680
I can give you one room.
but you will have to share it, I'm sorry.

478
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,240
- There's no way we can share.
- I am sorry. Forgive me.

479
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,760
There are eight of us.

480
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,280
- Yes?
- Paul, I need your help.

481
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,480
Yes, Madame Archer.

482
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,360
They're Tutsi children
from the St. Francis orphanage.

483
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,560
Okay, come on, let's go.

484
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,000
- I have only one room.
- That'll do.

485
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,600
Come.

486
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,920
- Otto, please.
- Excuse me.

487
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,880
Corporal, take that lady's bag, please.
and quickly.

488
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,680
- Have to go get the rest of them.
- The rest of them?

489
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,000
There are another ten.
I'll be back soon.

490
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,320
Madame Archer.

491
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,040
I have a favor to ask of you.

492
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,560
My brother-in-law and his family.
they live near the St. Francis.

493
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,640
On O'Clare, 20.

494
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,520
Can you please get them
and bring them here to me?

495
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,520
- Sure.
- And I have a photo.

496
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,120
Please, keep moving!

497
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,240
- Thanks, Paul.

498
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,080
Please move into the hotel!

499
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,760
Come on, kids, don't be afraid.

500
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,400
- Take them around the back.
- Everyone, keep moving!

501
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,400
Has he spoken to you yet?

502
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,440
No.

503
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,560
Is your face still hurting?

504
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,680
It's all right.

505
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,560
The neighbors asked me
to thank you for your kindness.

506
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,200
I shouldn't have brought them here.

507
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,320
The first thing they told me
when I received my appointment

508
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,000
was to never, never lower

509
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,200
"Maintain the Mille Collines' dignity
at all times, Paul,"

510
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,760
Soon all of this will be over.

511
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,200
What if I lose my job, Tatsi?

512
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,040
Oh, my God!

513
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,240
- Where are you going?
- I'll be right back.

514
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,400
Take care of them.

515
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,720
How, sir?

516
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,360
Bathe them, feed them.

517
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,000
Put them to bed.

518
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,600
I will send you some help.

519
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,960
Okay, babies.

520
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,440
We have heard reports
of reprisal massacres.

521
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,880
Will the U.N. intervene
to stop the bloodshed?

522
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,920
We're here as peacekeepers.
not as peacemakers.

523
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,560
My orders are
not to intervene.

524
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,280
- Excuse me.
- Thank you, Colonel.

525
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,040
Here. Over here.

526
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,080
Listen, I got us a car.
but we gotta move now.

527
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,400
We're not allowed
to do that, Jack.

528
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,680
David, the shit's going down outside
these walls. We gotta cover it.

529
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,720
We're not leaving the hotel grounds
unless we have an armored car.

530
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,920
- That's the ground rules.
- The ground rules?

531
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,720
Where do you think we are.
fucking Wimbledon?

532
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:41,560
We cover the story from here
until we get the proper vehicles, Jack.

533
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,000
Shoot some "B" roll of the refugees.

534
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,640
Let's go.

535
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,240
Colonel, I have no way
to protect these people.

536
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,040
And I have more refugees
than I have room for as it is.

537
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,400
I was given 20 orphans today
by the Red Cross.

538
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,400
This is not a refugee camp.

539
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,640
Can you not take them with you
to your facilities?

540
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,800
No, I can't do that, Paul.

541
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,360
I'm overwhelmed
at my refugee camp.

542
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,840
I'm under attack, constant attack.

543
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,680
As soon as we can stabilize
this situation, then I'll take 'em.

544
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:24,000
...and stop the Tutsi cockroaches
who try to run from justice.

545
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:28,440
The Tutsi cockroach judge
called Makesa is hiding at 4...

546
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,160
-... Kabulla and his cockroaches...
- Turn that radio off.

547
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,520
Watch out for him. He--

548
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,440
And get back to work.
We have a hotel to run.

549
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,560
There's no work here anyway.
The boss has left.

550
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,240
I am your boss!

551
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,040
Sir, there's a call from the Mille collines
in Rwanda on line one.

552
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,560
Yes? Who am I speaking to?

553
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,640
Yes, sir. Paul Rusesabagina.
the house manager.

554
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,760
I met you on your last visit here.
Mr. Tillens.

555
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,440
Ah, yes, Paul. I remember.

556
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,160
How are things there?

557
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,480
The situation is difficult, sir.

558
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,760
Some of our directors believe
we should close the Mille Collines

559
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,760
until this unrest is over.

560
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,360
I'm not sure about that, Paul.
What do you think?

561
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,800
Sir, that would be

562
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:42,000
The Mille Collines is an oasis of calm
for all our loyal customers.

563
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,120
What would they think
if Sabena deserted them now?

564
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,200
I assure you, the United Nations
have everything under control, sir.

565
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,400
Very well, Paul.
Very well.

566
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,240
But if this thing gets worse.
we must close.

567
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,520
If there is anything
I can do, please call.

568
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,480
Sir, yes, there is one thing I'm going
to be needing from you right away.

569
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,160
Let me tell you, it was an embarrassment
for me to have to ask for this.

570
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,960
Most of us in this room have known each
other and worked together for many years.

571
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,920
Is it really necessary
for me to get a letter from Belgium

572
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,600
for you to perform your duties?

573
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,840
In fact, forget this letter.

574
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,880
If you don't want to work for me and would
rather be out there, then leave now.

575
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,320
Please, everyone, back to work.

576
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,920
Paul, thank you for coming.

577
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,280
The air conditioner's on the blink. Is
there any way you can have a look at it?

578
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,200
- I'm just on a deadline.
- Certainly.

579
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,280
Fred, let me know when you
get the satellite feed. Thanks.

580
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,680
Mr. Fleming, I brought you
some tea as well, sir.

581
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,080
Thank you, Paul.

582
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,560
You're an oasis in the desert.

583
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,960
...the elements of
the government and army

584
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,640
are following the example of what
happened to the Americans in Somalia.

585
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:17,280
I think they intend to intimidate us.
try to attack us, and...

586
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,840
hope that the West
will pull all its troops out.

587
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,240
- Do you think they'll succeed?
- No, they won 't.

588
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,600
The U. N. 's here to stay.

589
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,280
What about
the outbreak of violence

590
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,240
since the shooting down
of the president's plane?

591
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,960
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

592
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,000
I'm responsible
for the safety of this crew.

593
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,680
What is this?

594
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,360
- Where did you get this?
- Half a mile down the road.

595
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,600
Fred, it's David.

596
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,400
I've got incredible footage.
It's a massacre.

597
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,000
Dead bodies, machetes.

598
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,160
If I get this through right away.
can you make the evening news?

599
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,080
Yeah.

600
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,800
You have to lead with this.

601
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,880
I point at you, you do a shot.

602
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:35,800
And you'll get a total double
and see if all the drinking--

603
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,880
- Excuse me, Mr. Daglish.
- Hey, Paul.

604
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,560
Listen, sorry about earlier.

605
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,120
If I'd known you were in there.
I wouldn't have--

606
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:48,800
I am glad that you have shot this footage
and that the world will see it.

607
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,880
It is the only way we have
a chance that people might intervene.

608
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,120
Yeah, and if no one intervenes.

609
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:04,600
How can they not intervene
when they witness such atrocities?

610
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,880
I think if people see this footage...

611
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,480
...they'll say, "Oh, my God.
that's horrible,"

612
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,320
and then go on
eating their dinners.

613
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,880
What the hell do I know?
Listen, you wanna just relax?

614
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,520
I have more work to do.
I thank you for your offer.

615
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,680
Please enjoy your evening.
Mr. Daglish.

616
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,400
- Help! Please help us! Please!
- Sir! Sir!

617
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,440
We've got trouble at the gate.

618
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,560
Can we have some
medical assistance here, please?

619
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,720
That group, come with me.
Move out of the area.

620
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,840
- Here, get up, get up.
- Right, fall back, everybody.

621
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,880
Benedict, what is happening?

622
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,760
They're killing everyone.
The lady...

623
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,480
The Interhamwe have surrounded
the whole town.

624
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,680
Come on!

625
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,080
Cover the road. Now.

626
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,480
Stand your ground.

627
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,280
Hold the line.

628
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,560
Do not shoot!
Do not shoot!

629
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,640
- Lieutenant, guard this gate.
- Yes, sir.

630
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:37,000
You two, take up positions
behind those sandbags.

631
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:41,960
They murdered my men.
I lost ten Belgian U.N. soldiers.

632
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,360
They were protecting
the lady prime minister.

633
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,520
- She is dead?
- Yeah, she's dead.

634
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:51,320
The Europeans are putting together
an intervention force.

635
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,840
They'll be here in a few days.

636
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:56,400
I understand that, Colonel, but there is

637
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,800
What can I do?

638
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,040
I'll put two more men on the gate.
two of my best lieutenants.

639
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,240
- All right.
- All right.

640
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,960
I understand. Thank you.

641
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,600
Madame Archer.

642
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,840
Hello.

643
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,080
- We were expecting you five days ago.
- I'm sorry.

644
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,480
My brother and his family.
did you find them?

645
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,200
I made it to the house.

646
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,760
- Empty?
- It had been ransacked.

647
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,920
As I left, an old woman.

648
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,920
I went to the house. She has
the two little girls. They're safe.

649
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,400
Okay.

650
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,240
But...

651
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:45,520
My brother and his wife--
did the old lady know of them?

652
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,280
My brother is dead.
They would never leave their children.

653
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,800
Perhaps they could not make it
home, Tatiana. They are hiding.

654
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:00,120
Please, can you return
and bring the girls back here to us?

655
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,800
I can't. There are
Interhamwe roadblocks everywhere.

656
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,280
When I reached the orphanage...

657
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,440
the Interhamwe were there.

658
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,000
They'd already started
killing children.

659
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,360
They made me watch.

660
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,080
There was one girl.

661
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,720
she had her little sister
wrapped on her back.

662
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,440
As they were about to chop her.
she cried out to me.

663
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,720
"Please don't let them kill me.

664
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,520
I promise I won't be Tutsi anymore,"

665
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,200
Please, I can't.

666
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:54,200
They're targeting Tutsi children, Paul.
to wipe out the next generation.

667
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,320
I've nowhere to take
the orphans, Paul.

668
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:09,720
Don't worry. There will be
an intervention force coming soon.

669
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,800
We will get the orphans out then.

670
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,440
They're here!

671
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,880
They're here! We are safe!

672
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,240
Soldiers have arrived!

673
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,320
- Wow, look, it's the French!

674
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,160
Thank goodness!

675
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,480
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

676
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,600
Well done.

677
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,320
About time, gentlemen.

678
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,440
Thank you for saving our lives.

679
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:58,760
It's okay, Roger.

680
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:04,600
Jean Baptiste, our prayers
have been answered. Thank God.

681
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,320
Yes, finally!

682
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,960
See, it's okay.

683
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,280
We can do nothing
from our side.

684
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,960
Sweetheart, I told you
we'd be safe.

685
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,640
See? I told you. Yeah.

686
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:27,720
So, Colonel, what can I get for you?

687
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,960
Something strong.

688
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,960
- Scotch?
- Yeah.

689
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,760
Congratulations, Colonel.

690
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,960
You have performed a minor miracle.

691
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,640
- Congratulations, huh?
- Yes, sir.

692
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,880
You should spit in my face.

693
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,120
Excuse me, Colonel?

694
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,960
You're dirt.

695
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:59,880
We think you're dirt, Paul.

696
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,760
Who is "we"?

697
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,040
The West, all the superpowers.
everything you believe in, Paul.

698
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,160
They think you're dirt.
they think you're dung. You're worthless.

699
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,640
I'm afraid I don't understand
what you are saying, sir.

700
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,960
Come on, don't bullshit me, Paul.

701
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,640
You're the smartest man here.

702
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,480
You got them all eating
out of your hands.

703
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:25,320
You could own this freakin' hotel.

704
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,680
you're black.

705
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,040
You're not even a nigger.

706
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,840
You're an African.

707
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,000
They're not gonna stay, Paul.

708
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,840
They're not gonna stop this slaughter.

709
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,320
Please.

710
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,080
Got it.

711
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,040
- Hello.
- Hello, Daddy.

712
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,800
Elys, take Diane in the other room.

713
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,080
What is it?

714
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,960
All the whites are leaving.

715
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,680
They are being evacuated.

716
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:15,440
But what about us?

717
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:18,000
We have been abandoned.

718
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,880
But the soldiers
will stop the killers.

719
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,320
Listen. Listen to me, Tatsi. Listen.

720
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:26,480
I said all the whites are leaving--
the French, the Italians.

721
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,000
even the U.N. Belgian soldiers.
all of them!

722
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,480
Who is left?

723
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:35,720
I don't know.

724
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:42,280
Colonel Oliver said he has 300
U.N. peacekeepers for the whole country.

725
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:47,160
The most he can spare
for the hotel are four men.

726
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,440
And they are not allowed to shoot.

727
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,840
I am a fool.

728
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,040
No. No, no.

729
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,600
They told me
I was one of them, and I...

730
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:10,600
Wine, chocolates, cigars, style--
I swallowed it.

731
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,800
I swallowed it.
I swallowed all of it.

732
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,080
And they handed me their shit.

733
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,160
I have no history.
I have no memory.

734
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,600
I'm a fool, Tatsi.

735
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,160
You are no fool.

736
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,560
I know who you are.

737
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,800
News Service Africa.

738
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:45,400
A United Nations source reports
that the U. S. and British representatives

739
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,080
on the Security council
will lobby for the removal

740
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,640
of all U.N. peacekeepers
from Rwanda.

741
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,160
Please, Jack.

742
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,080
Wait, he's British.

743
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,800
Jack, please don't leave me.

744
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,720
Can we talk?
Just one second.

745
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,520
Please, Jack. Please.

746
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,040
They'll put me on the street.
They'll chop me.

747
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:30,440
Here. Now just take...

748
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,600
- Take this.
- No, no...

749
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,840
Just take the money.
Please, just take the money.

750
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:37,400
You must go. You must.
Please, they are waiting.

751
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,080
- Paul!
- They are waiting.

752
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,040
Paul.

753
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:44,440
He won't put you out.
Here, give her anything she wants.

754
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,400
- Anything. Just charge it.
- This is not necessary.

755
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,680
- They're gonna kill us here.
- Let him go.

756
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,600
We have to let him go.

757
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,400
Don't do that, please.

758
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,400
Jesus Christ, I'm so ashamed.

759
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,000
Wait! Wait!

760
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,240
Hold the buses!

761
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,520
Peter!

762
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:39,160
Thank you for being here.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

763
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,280
- No Rwandans.
- What?

764
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,960
Foreign nationals only.
Sorry, Father, those were the orders.

765
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:47,560
- But you can't leave the children behind.
- Sorry, Father, we have our orders.

766
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,040
- You can't leave them!
- We can do no more.

767
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,880
Father, it is of no use.

768
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,120
These men are not here--
They are not here to help us.

769
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,720
Please, there is nothing we can do.

770
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,960
Get your people on the bus.
I will take care of the others.

771
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,960
It is of no use, Father.

772
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:06,120
No, no, no.

773
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,800
To the hotel.
To the hotel.

774
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,640
Sir, please, don't touch the camera.
We have the right to film.

775
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:17,280
- No filming.
- Go to the hotel.

776
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,760
Go inside.

777
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,680
Go inside the hotel.

778
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,960
Yes, you can stay, yes.
We will take care of you.

779
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,800
Go into the hotel.

780
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,040
No!

781
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:36,720
Go to the hotel.
Go inside. Go inside the hotel.

782
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,880
Excuse me. Excuse me.

783
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,160
- Sir.
- Come, Dube.

784
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:36,080
- Please, everyone inside.
- Please, people, let's go inside.

785
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,960
Out of the rain, please.
Come, sister, come.

786
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:45,520
Paul.

787
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:50,960
I want you to go.

788
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,680
Go where?

789
00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:00,240
You take the children.
You go get the girls.

790
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,320
- Your card says Hutu--
- What are you saying?

791
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,760
Please, please.
You pay money at the roadblocks.

792
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,680
I want you to go.

793
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,360
No, Tatiana, no.

794
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,240
I will never leave you.

795
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,760
I will never leave you.

796
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,400
Oh, Tatsi.

797
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,240
Let us sleep, my wife.
Let us sleep.

798
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,840
Get up. Get up.

799
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,480
Get up, get up, get up.

800
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,880
- Are you the manager?
- Yes, sir. What's the matter?

801
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,480
Everyone must leave the hotel now.

802
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,640
- Why?
- Papa, what's wrong?

803
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:58,960
It's an order.

804
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:04,280
I need some time--
20, 30 minutes--to take a shower.

805
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,680
- Sir, people are still sleeping.
- I don't care.

806
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:14,560
Please, let me get you some beers.
You and your boys.

807
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:17,640
And I'll be down right away, all right?
As quick as I can.

808
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:20,520
- Ten minutes.
- Yes, sir, ten minutes.

809
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,560
- Get out of the way.
- Quick, children, quickly.

810
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:27,640
- Roger's not here.
- Where is he? Where's Roger?

811
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:28,760
Under the bed.

812
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,520
Roger. It's Papa.

813
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,360
They've gone.
They've gone, they've gone.

814
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,680
Come, come. Come on.

815
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,920
Oh, my darling.
It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.

816
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,120
Come on, it's okay. It's okay.

817
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:47,720
- Go to the roof, Tatiana.

818
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,800
Yes, yes.
go to the roof right now.

819
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:53,120
Yes, good day.
General Bizimungu, please.

820
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,920
He is where?

821
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
No, that is unacceptable.

822
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,680
Who would order such a thing?

823
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,840
Yes, did you find the general?

824
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:09,480
Gentlemen, please have some beer.

825
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,160
Get me the guest list.

826
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:13,400
Yes, sir.

827
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,080
Yes?

828
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:20,920
Sorry, sir, but I have a call
from Paul in Kigali. He says it's urgent.

829
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,840
Paul, are you all right?

830
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:24,320
We have a big problem, sir.

831
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,520
What?

832
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,640
The Hutu army have come.

833
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:30,120
They've ordered us--
all of us--out of the hotel.

834
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,920
Why are they doing this?

835
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,360
I think they will kill us all.

836
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:35,320
Kill?

837
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:40,440
What do you mean all?
How many?

838
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:45,120
We have 100 staff
and now more than 800 guests.

839
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:47,160
- 800?!
- Yes, sir.

840
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:50,280
There are now 800 Tutsi
and Hutu refugees.

841
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:52,800
I do not have much time left, sir.

842
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,240
I want to thank you

843
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,480
for everything that you
have done for me and my family.

844
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:03,560
and please thank all
of my friends at Sabena.

845
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,520
Paul, wait.

846
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,760
I'm gonna put you on hold.
Stay by the phone.

847
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,480
- Where are your papers?
- We don't have any papers, sir.

848
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:16,720
We don't have any papers.
They got burnt in the house.

849
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:20,080
Louis, get on to the U.N.
Tell them what's happening.

850
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,600
Did you need something, sir?

851
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:25,840
Mary, call the prime minister's office.
Tell them I must speak with him now.

852
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,040
Okay.

853
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,880
Paul, are you there?

854
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:33,320
Yes, sir.

855
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,000
Who can I call to stop this?

856
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,400
The French.
They supply the Hutu army.

857
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:45,400
Do everything you can to buy time.
I'll call you right back.

858
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,800
What are you doing, Dube?

859
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,680
The lieutenant, sir.

860
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:00,680
- Go and get these boys some more beer.
- Thirsty, boy? You like beer?

861
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:02,040
Thank you.

862
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,080
Come with me, please.

863
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:12,600
Sir, that was two weeks ago.

864
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,120
Here you are, sir.

865
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:24,160
Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier...

866
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:26,920
What is this?

867
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,160
It is the guest list, sir.

868
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,160
Are you trying to make a fool of me?

869
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:39,120
No. We stopped taking names
after the president was murdered.

870
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,520
- This is the only guest list, sir.
- There are no Europeans left!

871
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:47,760
Get me the names
of all the cockroaches in there now.

872
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,440
- That will take time.
- We don't have time.

873
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:56,000
If I don't have the names
so that I can pick out the traitors.

874
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:58,800
then I'll kill everyone in there.

875
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,680
Starting with you.

876
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,880
Leave.

877
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,200
Yes, sir.

878
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,320
Yes, sir.

879
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,000
Who did you call?

880
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,440
- Who did I call?
- Don't lie to me!

881
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,600
What is your name?

882
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,920
Rusesabagina.

883
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,880
Paul Rusesabagina.

884
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:37,080
I'll remember you.

885
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:39,640
I'll remember you.

886
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:44,160
- Let's go.
- Come on, we're leaving.

887
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:54,280
They've gone.

888
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:58,840
Paul, Paul.

889
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,280
I was afraid for you.

890
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:08,080
Sir, the president of Sabena
is on the phone for you.

891
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,280
I must talk with this man.

892
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,480
- Mr. Tillens.
- Paul, what's going on?

893
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:22,760
They left. Thank you, sir.
What did you do?

894
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:25,800
I got through to the French
president's office.

895
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:30,200
Well, thank you.
You have saved our lives.

896
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,440
I pleaded with the French and
the Belgians to go back and get you all.

897
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,840
I am afraid this is not
going to happen.

898
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,840
They're cowards, Paul.

899
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:47,320
Rwanda is not worth
a single vote to any of them.

900
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:51,480
The French, the British.

901
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:54,120
I am sorry, Paul.

902
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:57,360
Thank you.

903
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:02,400
There will be no rescue...

904
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,680
...no intervention for us.

905
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:09,400
We can only save ourselves.

906
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,640
Many of you know
influential people abroad.

907
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,160
You must call these people.

908
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:17,120
Please, fax this

909
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,800
You must tell them
what will happen to us.

910
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:22,840
Say good-bye.

911
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,360
But when you say good-bye.

912
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:32,400
say it as though you are reaching
through the phone and holding their hand.

913
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:35,840
Let them know that
if they let go of that hand...

914
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,280
...you will die.

915
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:46,080
We must shame them
into sending help.

916
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:53,200
Most importantly.
this cannot be a refugee camp.

917
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:57,200
The Interhamwe believe that the
Mille Collines is a four-star Sabena hotel.

918
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:00,800
That is the only thing
that is keeping us alive.

919
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,720
Have you printed the bills?

920
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,560
Thank you.
Now please erase the register.

921
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:09,520
- Erase it?
- Yes, I want no names to appear there.

922
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,120
Boss, the carpenters are ready.

923
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,800
Tell them to remove
all of the numbers from the doors.

924
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,800
- And put what?
- And put nothing.

925
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:26,880
Good day.
Here is your bill for the last week.

926
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:29,520
If you cannot pay
or think you will not be able to pay.

927
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:32,840
please go to the banquet room and
Dube will take care of you. Thank you.

928
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:39,160
Does the State Department
have a view

929
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:43,280
as to whether or not
what is happening could be genocide?

930
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:46,600
We have every reason to believe
that acts of genocide have occurred.

931
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:51,200
How many acts of genocide
does it take to make genocide?

932
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:54,160
Alan, that's just not a question
that I'm in a position to answer.

933
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:57,680
Is it true that you
have specific guidance

934
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:00,120
not to use the word "genocide"
in isolation.

935
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:02,680
but always to preface it
with this word "acts of"?

936
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:09,040
I have guidance
which I try to use as best as I can.

937
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:10,600
I have--

938
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,000
There are formulations
that we are using

939
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:15,920
that we are trying to be
consistent in our use of--

940
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:20,160
I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.

941
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:22,800
As long as it is scotch.

942
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:28,600
Your white friends
have abandoned you.

943
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:32,840
- So it would seem.
- Well, don't worry.

944
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:36,080
- I will take care of you.
- I'm glad to hear that

945
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:38,960
because I was wondering if perhaps
you could spare us a few policemen.

946
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,160
To protect us, sir.

947
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:43,120
- The police are very busy, Paul.
- Yes, I'm aware of this.

948
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:46,320
But when I last spoke
to the president of Sabena.

949
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:49,640
he assured me that anyone
who helped protect Belgian property

950
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,120
would be well rewarded.

951
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,400
I will see what I can do.

952
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:56,080
Excuse me momentarily, sir.

953
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,480
Where has all our beer gone?

954
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:03,040
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beer.

955
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:05,080
How much beer?

956
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:07,000
Many.

957
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:13,080
...come down to the reception.
And then he says to me.

958
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:14,680
"How do you want the girls?"

959
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:19,400
There's our cockroach manager.
Always kissing ass.

960
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,000
General...

961
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,320
I'm glad you came by.

962
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:32,440
I overheard something
that I think you should know about.

963
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:33,680
What did you overhear?

964
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:37,840
It was a discussion between a U.N. Colonel
and an American Embassy official.

965
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:39,240
And what did they say?

966
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:42,040
The American assured the colonel
that they would watch everything.

967
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:43,600
How? They have gone, Paul.

968
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:46,640
With their spies. Satellites.

969
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:50,800
Americans.

970
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:52,680
Oh, Gregoire!

971
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,160
You know, I admire you, General.

972
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:01,520
How do you keep command
of your men amid such madness?

973
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:05,200
- I am a strong man, Paul.
- I wish I were more like you.

974
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:08,360
- I mean, look at my staff.
- Cheers.

975
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,960
He won't work.

976
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:13,520
- He is staff?
- Oh, yes.

977
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:14,560
Yes.

978
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,960
Get back to work, you slug! Go!

979
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:29,640
Satellites?

980
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:34,120
What was I going to say, that
the Americans were hiding in the trees?

981
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:49,320
- What's the matter?
- I have to go out and get food.

982
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:53,160
- Go out? Where?
- To George Rutaganda's place.

983
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:55,280
No. No, no.

984
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:57,080
I have to, Tatiana.

985
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:59,680
We are only as valuable
as the money we give to him.

986
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,360
You cannot go alone.

987
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:05,680
I'm not going alone.
I'll take Gregoire with me.

988
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:08,880
He's a good Hutu.
and he wants to impress me now.

989
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:20,400
It is good to see you
back at work, Gregoire.

990
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:23,400
- Please, sir, accept my humblest apologies.
- Please, please.

991
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,000
We have a job this morning.

992
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:28,280
We are going
to see George Rutaganda.

993
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:30,600
Please get the van.

994
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:50,960
Show me your I.D.

995
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:53,440
Remember how those Tutsi women
used to look down

996
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:56,400
their long noses at Hutu men?
Now they beg for their lives.

997
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:58,920
I'm here to see my friend
George Rutaganda.

998
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:03,160
I say taste those
Tutsi whores before they die.

999
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:06,640
Then they'll know
what Hutu power is, my warriors.

1000
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:10,320
Remember, one cockroach
can start an infestation.

1001
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:12,760
We need to exterminate these vermin.

1002
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,480
Hey, Paul, my old friend.

1003
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:51,600
Tutsi prostitutes and witches.
So, what can I do for you?

1004
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:54,800
- I need supplies, George.
- Anytime.

1005
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:03,120
Paul, everything is double the price now.
You understand that?

1006
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:06,200
Yes, I need rice, beans.

1007
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:09,560
powdered milk, beer.
and your best whiskey.

1008
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:14,000
Beer yes, but whiskey no.

1009
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,600
You have no whiskey?

1010
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:18,240
No whiskey, no spirits.

1011
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:22,840
Your rich guests will have to do
without their scotch.

1012
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:26,800
Anyway, Paul.
I have bled that cow enough now.

1013
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,320
What are you saying, George?

1014
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:34,760
Your rich cockroaches at the hotel.

1015
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:37,720
Soon all the Tutsis will be dead.

1016
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:43,320
You do not honestly believe
that you can kill them all?

1017
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:45,960
And why not?

1018
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,040
Why not?

1019
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:51,520
We are halfway there already.

1020
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:56,960
So, Paul, you want
12 bags of rice?

1021
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:00,600
Give him 12 bags of rice
and 4 crates of beer.

1022
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,120
Yes, sir, right away.

1023
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:09,120
Oh, and, Paul. I'll give you a crate
of soft drinks for the kids free of charge.

1024
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:11,600
Yes.

1025
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,960
Ten bags of beans.
Come, quick.

1026
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,920
And put those in the van. You.

1027
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,400
Let me give you
a little tip, my friend.

1028
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:25,080
Our generals in army say.
"Don't go near the Mille Collines

1029
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:27,240
or they will send
the Belgian soldiers back here,"

1030
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:31,440
But soon those generals will
have gone and we will be in charge.

1031
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:36,680
It's time to butcher that fat cow
of yours for the meat.

1032
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:48,480
Let's go.

1033
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:53,200
Maybe you could help us, Paul.

1034
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:56,040
You have some very important
traitors at that hotel.

1035
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:58,440
Now, if we were to get them.

1036
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:02,160
then maybe we would let you have
one or two cockroaches of your own.

1037
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,360
Do you understand?

1038
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:10,000
It is almost dawn, George.

1039
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,080
We really must be going.

1040
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:16,840
Take the river road back.
It's clear.

1041
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:40,160
- Gregoire.
- What is going on now?

1042
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:42,360
- You've driven off the road.
- No, I'm on the road.

1043
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:45,160
You're going to put us in the river.
Stop the car, stop the car.

1044
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:07,880
Back up the car, Gregoire.

1045
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:10,800
Listen to me.

1046
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:15,400
You will tell no one
what you have seen here today.

1047
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:16,800
No one, Gregoire.

1048
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:36,280
Dube. Please help Gregoire
to unload the van. Thank you.

1049
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:10,560
Oh, dear.

1050
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:42,600
Oh, God!

1051
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:46,840
Oh, God!

1052
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,280
- Sir.
- Dube!

1053
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:53,040
- Sir, are you okay?
- Don't come in. Don't come in.

1054
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:55,040
I'll be out in a minute.

1055
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:58,960
- Sir, are you okay?
- Yes, I'm all right, Dube.

1056
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,560
Don't come in, I'll be out.

1057
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:35,680
Hundreds.

1058
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,320
It was too many to count.

1059
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:46,080
Why are people so cruel?

1060
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:51,000
Hatred.

1061
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,160
Insanity, I don't know.

1062
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:00,640
There you go.

1063
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:02,920
Is she putting
her fingers in the soup?

1064
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:04,800
Oh, yes.

1065
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:08,320
to do with you.
Nothing to do with me.

1066
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,720
I remember...

1067
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,440
No, no, no, you make a mistake.

1068
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:14,120
- Hello.
- Come with me.

1069
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:17,920
- Where are we going?
- Just come.

1070
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:35,360
It's beautiful.

1071
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:38,480
You like it?

1072
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,880
I hear we must pay for everything.

1073
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:51,400
Yes, this is true.

1074
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:56,000
So how much for this?

1075
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,360
A kiss.

1076
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:15,360
You are a good man.
Paul Rusesabagina.

1077
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:32,880
I have a confession.

1078
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,800
When you worked as the nurse...

1079
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:38,920
- In Ruhengeri?
- Yes.

1080
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,960
When we first met...

1081
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:44,840
I had you transferred to Kigali.

1082
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:48,400
What?

1083
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:53,640
I bribed the Minister of Health
to have you transferred to Kigali.

1084
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,920
- Why?
- To be closer.

1085
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:01,000
So that I could marry you.

1086
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:08,680
What was the bribe?

1087
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:14,400
- What am I worth to you?
- It was substantial.

1088
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:17,200
- Tell me what it was.
- A car.

1089
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:21,920
- What sort of car?
- What does that matter?

1090
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,760
I want to know.

1091
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:26,800
A Volkswagen.

1092
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:32,880
I hope it was a new one.

1093
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:00,000
We have had a good life.
you and I. Yes.

1094
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:07,240
I thank God every day
for the time we've had.

1095
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:16,800
- We have to have a plan.
- A plan?

1096
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:21,480
Our children cannot
see us die first.

1097
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:24,800
If the militia come, you must
come up here as quick as you can.

1098
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:27,400
- Please, I don't want to--

1099
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:30,320
- I don't want you to talk like this, please.
- We have to, Tatiana.

1100
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:34,320
If I do not make it.

1101
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:37,080
you must take all of our children
by the hand...

1102
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,080
and you must jump.

1103
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:45,200
- What are you saying? I could never--
- You have to, Tatiana.

1104
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,960
- You have to promise me.
- What are you saying?

1105
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,200
Tatiana, the machete is no way to die.
You have to promise me you will do it.

1106
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:52,920
I cannot do--

1107
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:55,600
You have to
promise me, Tatiana. Please.

1108
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:57,200
Promise me you will do it.

1109
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:02,440
Please, Tatiana.

1110
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:06,560
Yes.

1111
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:10,960
I'm sorry. I love you.

1112
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:13,920
I love you.

1113
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:22,880
I'm gonna get you!

1114
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:26,200
Diane, Elys, you know better.

1115
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:28,680
No one can be at the front
of the hotel, I have told you this.

1116
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:30,960
- Take these children in the back. Hurry.
- Sorry, Papa.

1117
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:33,880
- Come, children. Come.

1118
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:39,600
Paul, I've got good news.

1119
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:46,080
Congratulations.
Your calls have worked.

1120
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:49,800
I have exit visas
for the following families.

1121
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:52,920
Abukesu, Tanzania.

1122
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,840
Bidori, Kenya.

1123
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:59,680
Gituaranga, Zambia.

1124
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:01,480
Hallelujah!

1125
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:03,120
Khalesa, Belgium.

1126
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:04,320
Oh, thank you!

1127
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:06,760
Dakuzi...

1128
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:09,480

1129
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:13,000

Rusesabagina, Belgium.

1132
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:22,040
All right, that's it.

1133
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:26,320
So remember.

1134
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:27,600
Let's go.

1135
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:28,680
- Colonel?
- Yeah.

1136
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:31,840
Now, certainly Odette
and Jean Baptiste are on the list.

1137
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:34,600
I'm sorry, Jean, Odette.

1138
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:39,160
But I have been assured
there will be another plane soon.

1139
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:40,160
Excuse me.

1140
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:45,520
Don't worry, Tatsi.
we'll make it to the next list.

1141
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:46,560
Yeah.

1142
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:50,920
The girls--
Paul, I will not leave without them.

1143
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:01,800
What have you brought us?

1144
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:05,040
Antibiotics, medical supplies.
general first aid.

1145
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:06,560
Thank you.

1146
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:09,000
- I hear there's to be a convoy.
- Yes.

1147
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:10,720
Are you on the list?

1148
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:18,600
Madame Archer, I have

1149
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:22,680
Is there any way that you
could return to the old woman

1150
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:24,640
and bring the girls
back here to us?

1151
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:28,520
Paul, that side of town has been

1152
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:30,720
They're probably dead.

1153
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:36,840
Madame Archer, I'm begging you.
Those girls have no one now.

1154
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:41,920
I'll try.

1155
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
We have to leave by 7 a.m.

1156
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:47,520
Who'll take care
of the orphans when you're gone?

1157
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:51,080
Odette, Odette will care for them
until we can get them out of here.

1158
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:58,960
Tell me, Paul, what country's
gonna take 20 Rwandan orphans?

1159
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:02,600
I will find someone.
I promise you.

1160
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:06,800
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

1161
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,360
Come on, take my hand.

1162
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:19,120
News Service Africa.
Today a Red cross representative

1163
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:21,640
claimed that the death rate
in the Rwandan conflict

1164
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:25,120
may have climbed to as many
as 500,000 victims.

1165
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:27,520
One report stated
that 40,000 bodies

1166
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:29,720
had been removed
from Lake Victoria.

1167
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:32,480
Where is she?

1168
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:36,200
I don't know.
We wait until seven.

1169
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:38,560
If she is not back
with the girls by then...

1170
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:41,280
...she may not be coming.

1171
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:44,960
Thank you.

1172
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,160
Please, take these letters.

1173
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:49,400
Yes, I will take your letters.

1174
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:51,840
Thank you so much, Paul.
taking the letter.

1175
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:56,040
- Thank you so much.
- Yes, I am sorry.

1176
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:57,200
Thank you very much.

1177
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:59,920
I am sorry, I wish I could
have done more. I am sorry.

1178
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:03,880
God be with you.

1179
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:08,280
- Yes, do you have any children?
- Yes, you're clear to go.

1180
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:11,320
No, sorry, no good.

1181
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:14,080
Come. Come, children.

1182
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:15,800
Tatsi, come.

1183
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,840
Please, Paul, the girls.
We wait a little longer.

1184
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:21,800
We cannot wait.
We cannot wait, Tatsi.

1185
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:22,840
There you go.

1186
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:24,720
Let's move out!

1187
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:29,560
Good luck, sir.

1188
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:44,920
I am not leaving. You hold Tatiana.
Take care of my family.

1189
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:52,280
Paul, Paul!

1190
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:56,760
I cannot leave these people to die.
I cannot leave these people.

1191
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:58,040
Papa!

1192
01:24:58,120 --> 01:25:00,960
Roger! Roger, I will follow
on the next flight.

1193
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,680
No, don't leave me! Paul!

1194
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:07,040
Don't worry. Don't worry, children.
Your father's going to be okay.

1195
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:08,120
Papa!

1196
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:11,800
- Don't worry. He's okay.
- I want Papa!

1197
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:13,280
It's okay.

1198
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:40,960
I say those Hutus
who shelter the cockroaches

1199
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,240
are the same as cockroaches.

1200
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:47,080
- They are all the same.
- This is crazy.

1201
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:51,040
Their fate should be the same.
This is RTLM.

1202
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:05,640
The Tutsi cockroaches
of the rebel army must be denied recruits.

1203
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:09,160
come on, good Hutus.
The graves are not yet full.

1204
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:12,000
- Who will help us fill them?
- That goddamn radio station.

1205
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:16,200
Okay. Yeah, they are
going to the airport.

1206
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:23,480
Stand by your radios.
I am hearing some urgent news.

1207
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:27,600
- Boss! Please, come quick!
- Not now, Dube.

1208
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:30,520
It is important! It is on the radio.
You have to hear it.

1209
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:34,960
We have received reports
of very important cockroaches

1210
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:38,720
and traitors trying to escape
from the Mille collines Hotel.

1211
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,240
Gather up your weapons.

1212
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:43,360
Stand by your radios.
We will keep you informed.

1213
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:46,520
- They are being smuggled away...
- No, no! Who told them of this, Dube?

1214
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:49,720
I saw Gregoire, sir. It is Gregoire.
I saw him leaving in our bus.

1215
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:01,280
Please, sir.

1216
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:03,840
I say who leaves that hotel.
and no one else.

1217
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:08,960
General Bizimungu.
they are driving into an ambush.

1218
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:29,640
Slow down.

1219
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:32,960
Stay calm.

1220
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:35,400
- What is happening?
- We're stopping.

1221
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:39,600
You have got cockroaches
in these trucks.

1222
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:41,960
No, no. I've got
U.N. personnel in these trucks.

1223
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,160
I've got permission to go
through these roadblocks.

1224
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:47,400
- I'm going to search these trucks.
- You are not going to search this convoy.

1225
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,040
- I am.
- Cover me.

1226
01:27:57,800 --> 01:27:59,200
Go to the back.

1227
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:08,480
Get away from that truck.
Get away from that truck! Now!

1228
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:19,680
Get back!
You're not to hurt these people.

1229
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:22,640
Get back! Move back!

1230
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:25,600
Look, I told you.
you've got cockroaches in your truck.

1231
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:29,160
No, no, no. They're political refugees
under U.N. sanction.

1232
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:36,640
News has come to us
that we have cowards in our own army

1233
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:38,760
who will not let us punish them.

1234
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:42,760
No!

1235
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,720
You're moving cockroaches
from Mille Collines?

1236
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:49,160
No, sir. No, sir.

1237
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:52,160
- They cannot leave Mille Collines.
- They are not leaving.

1238
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:53,960
Stop him!

1239
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:57,560
You bastard!

1240
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:04,120
What's your name?

1241
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:06,440
- What's your name?
- I can't think...

1242
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:10,080
- Kill them!
- Get everybody out of here! Move it!

1243
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:12,840
What's your name?
What's your name?

1244
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:14,720
Let's move! Drive!

1245
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:16,480
Move! Get out!

1246
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:17,960
Out, or I'll shoot!

1247
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:22,040
Get out!

1248
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:27,200
Drive, drive! Let's go!

1249
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:30,000
Help us get out of here.

1250
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:31,760
Clear the street!

1251
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:43,520
I am receiving more news.
good Hutus.

1252
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:47,280
I have learned that
the traitor Rusesabagina's cockroaches

1253
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:48,680
are on a truck.

1254
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:50,880
1 0,000 francs for their heads!

1255
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:55,640
Stay still.
Give me your shirt, quickly.

1256
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:06,720
Come on, Paul.

1257
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:09,720
Come on, here, here.

1258
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:13,400
Please, please.

1259
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:16,160
- Hey, medic. Get a medic over here!
- You need to hurry up, please.

1260
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:17,880
Come, hurry, hurry.

1261
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:23,000
- Let me help you.
- Someone give this guard a hand, please.

1262
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:27,280
Oh, Tatiana, my darling.

1263
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:32,320
- I was so worried about you.
- Move that truck out of the way!

1264
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:33,360
Get him inside!

1265
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:36,200
Tatiana, Tatiana.

1266
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:39,880
You left me.
You left me.

1267
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:41,960
Take this, I don't want it.
I don't want it.

1268
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:44,720
You said you'd never leave me.
and you left me. You are a liar!

1269
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:48,920
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1270
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,720
- I'm sorry.
- Papa, Papa.

1271
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:53,560
- Papa, Mama!
- I love you.

1272
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:04,480
I wanted you to be safe.
all of you.

1273
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:07,880
That was not
your decision to make.

1274
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:11,240
We make our decisions together.
That was our promise.

1275
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:12,920
You're right.

1276
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:14,960
You're right.

1277
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:17,800
I knew that the minute
the truck pulled away.

1278
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:19,200
I'm sorry.

1279
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:20,680
Come on, put some more water.

1280
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:22,240
What are they doing?

1281
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:24,760
Dube.

1282
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:29,040
I'm sorry, sir. They shut down
the water. This is all we have.

1283
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:36,920
General.

1284
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:38,400
Where are my supplies?

1285
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:41,000
I'm sorry, sir.
The cellar is empty.

1286
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:45,920
You have nothing, and yet
you call me, begging me for help?

1287
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,240
Do you know the trouble I have
protecting these cockroaches?

1288
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:50,520
Sir, I have money from the guests.

1289
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:52,440
Rwandan francs!

1290
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:55,440
Those are only good
for wiping your ass.

1291
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:59,000
There is nothing more
I can do for you, Paul.

1292
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:01,600
No more police.
no more protection.

1293
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:05,680
Let the U.N. take care of you.

1294
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:10,160
Drive. Go!

1295
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:18,520
What would Sabena make of this?

1296
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,040
Watch out!

1297
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,240
Get down, get down!

1298
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:40,760
Are you hurt?
Go outside.

1299
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:43,280
Please stay still.
There's glass here, I will get it out.

1300
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:45,000
Is anyone hurt, Odette?

1301
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:47,120
Lots of cuts and bruises.

1302
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:55,120
Thank God it was a storeroom.

1303
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:59,800
And in Rwanda.
humanitarian agencies report

1304
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:02,280
that a rapid advance
by the Tutsi rebel army

1305
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:06,080
has sparked a mass evacuation
of Hutu refugees towards the Congo.

1306
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:08,200
One aid worker described it

1307
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:11,160
as the largest refugee exodus
in modern history.

1308
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:12,880
The rebels have taken half the city.

1309
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:16,960
and they have proposed a deal
the Hutu generals are willing to accept.

1310
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:20,760
The rebels will exchange
their Hutu prisoners.

1311
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:22,560
and you people.
all of you.

1312
01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:25,880
will be able to move
behind the rebel lines where it's safe.

1313
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:27,920
The Interhamwe, what about them?

1314
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:31,200
- No one controls them.
- This time they will kill us all.

1315
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:33,560
They will kill us all if we stay here.

1316
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:35,840
We have to take the chance.

1317
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:38,680
What time should we
be ready to leave?

1318
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:41,560
I can put it together
in two days, Paul.

1319
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:42,840
Two days?

1320
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:46,280
Colonel, there is no way that we
can hold out for two days.

1321
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:48,080
I have nothing left
to bribe them with.

1322
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:53,440
Colonel, we will

1323
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:19,160
Diane let your mother rest.

1324
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:21,440
You rest too, sweetheart.

1325
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:31,120
Diplomat.

1326
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:34,040
What?

1327
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:36,800
I have to go to the Diplomat.

1328
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:49,440
- What are you doing?
- We have to go to the Diplomat.

1329
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:51,920
- To do what?
- Your items, they are there.

1330
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:55,680
Will you please put your
policemen at the gate, sir?

1331
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:58,560
No. Let us see
what you have to offer first.

1332
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:11,600
Oh, no, Madame Archer.

1333
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:29,680
Move, move!

1334
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:36,160
- Cover us.
- Yes, sir.

1335
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:37,200
Hurry!

1336
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:42,600
Come on, show me.

1337
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:54,160
Look at this.
Nice, yes?

1338
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,160
And here you are.

1339
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:05,160
The rebels are
getting closer, yes?

1340
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,440
The rebels can have this graveyard.

1341
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:10,720
We have ordered everyone
out of the city.

1342
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:14,480
Here.

1343
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:16,720
Have a drink.

1344
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:25,120
You know what
the Scottish call it?

1345
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:26,640
No.

1346
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:31,680
Uisge beatha--water of life.

1347
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:43,320
I went once on a tour of the finest
single malt distillery in the world.

1348
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:46,960
- Have you ever been to Scotland?
- No, sir.

1349
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:49,480
Wonderful country.

1350
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:51,720
Wonderful golf.

1351
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:55,880
I wonder, will I ever go back?

1352
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:58,680
What do you think?

1353
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,080
No.

1354
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:05,520
I hope we all get to do
a great many things, General.

1355
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:08,440
Can we go now.
please, sir?

1356
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:12,680
I am going to do you
a great favor, Paul.

1357
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:14,640
- Private.
- Yes, sir!

1358
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:17,760
Pack those carefully.
put them in my keep, and guard them.

1359
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:22,840
I am going to take you with us
to our new headquarters in Gitarama.

1360
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:25,600
I do not want to go
to Gitarama, sir.

1361
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:28,240
Well, you can't go back
to the hotel.

1362
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:30,040
The crazy men are
on their way there now.

1363
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:35,320
Sir General, we must go back
so that I can get my family.

1364
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:38,360
Trust me.

1365
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:43,120
General, these are difficult times.

1366
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:44,920
We need to help one another.

1367
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:48,160
And what help can I get
from you, Paul?

1368
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:51,520
You are a marked man, sir.

1369
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:55,240
You are on a list. The Americans
have you on their list as a war criminal.

1370
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:58,200
Paul, I am sick and tired

1371
01:37:58,240 --> 01:38:00,920
Are you stupid, General?

1372
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:03,080
How do you think
these people operate?

1373
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:07,440
You sit here with five stars on your chest.
Who do you think they are coming after?

1374
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:12,960
Fine.

1375
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:18,080
We will go to Gitarama.
and you will stay on that list.

1376
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:21,920
- I committed no war crimes.
- Who will tell them?

1377
01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:24,800
You need me to tell them
how you helped at the hotel.

1378
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:27,960
They blame you for all their misfortunes.
They say you led the massacres.

1379
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,440
I led no massacres!

1380
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:31,360
Do you think they're
going to believe you?

1381
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:32,920
You will tell them the truth!

1382
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:35,080
I will tell them nothing
unless you help me.

1383
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:39,200
What are you going to do.
shoot me?

1384
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:42,400
Shoot me.

1385
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:45,080
Please shoot me.
It would be a blessing.

1386
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:48,320
I will pay you to shoot my family.

1387
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:50,560
You cannot hurt me.

1388
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:54,040
You will tell them
that I did nothing!

1389
01:38:56,680 --> 01:38:59,440
We are leaving.
Right now.

1390
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:09,760
Get out!

1391
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Get these people
away from the gate!

1392
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:21,520
Stop it! Stop it!

1393
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:23,480

1394
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:26,280

1396
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:29,680
Get out!

1397
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:34,480
All of the militia
must leave now! Get out!

1398
01:39:55,160 --> 01:39:56,280
Oh, no, no!

1399
01:39:56,360 --> 01:39:57,800
Shut up, cockroach!
Get down!

1400
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:02,000
That's him. That's him!

1401
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:05,120
- Shit.
- That's the manager!

1402
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:08,320
- Stop him. Stop him!
- I got him! I got him!

1403
01:40:19,160 --> 01:40:21,080
Stay where you are!

1404
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:38,960
Tatiana!

1405
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:41,840
Tatiana!

1406
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:49,760
- Have you seen Tatiana?
- No, I've not seen Tatiana.

1407
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:52,240
- Paul, what is happening?
- I have to find my wife!

1408
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:55,520
Tatiana!

1409
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:00,480
Tatiana!

1410
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:27,840
They've gone. They've gone.

1411
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:31,040
They've gone.

1412
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:37,680
What were you
going to do with this?

1413
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,840
I thought you had...

1414
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:50,640
I thought you had jumped.

1415
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:04,400
Everyone on the trucks, please.

1416
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:07,120
Take your luggage.
Families please stay together.

1417
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:09,920

01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,320
There's enough room for everyone.

1419
01:42:15,480 --> 01:42:17,280
I hope someday we will come back.

1420
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:19,600
Let's move out.

1421
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:31,280
What is wrong with her?

1422
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:33,920
She has a very high fever.

1423
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:43,800
Where are we going, Daddy?

1424
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:45,400
Some place safe.

1425
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:42,000
My God.

01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:05,040

01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:30,640
It's the rebels.
We're crossing the front line.
