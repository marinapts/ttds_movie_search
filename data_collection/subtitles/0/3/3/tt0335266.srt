[Man #2] Four buses... And he took that thing and everything exploded.

41
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:03,766
I heard he did his own driving. Did you do your own driving?

42
00:05:03,869 --> 00:05:05,769
I did. Cool.

43
00:05:05,871 --> 00:05:08,772
[Man #1] So, what are you doing here? [Man #2] Yeah.

44

62
00:09:21,793 --> 00:09:25,490
Um, he want you to turn, look in camera.

63
00:09:25,597 --> 00:09:28,157
Okay?

64
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:30,564
That's all he said? Yes.

65
00:09:30,669 --> 00:09:32,637
Turn to camera.

66
00:09:35,073 --> 00:09:38,270
All right, does he want me to... to... turn from the right,

67
00:09:38,376 --> 00:09:40,708
or... turn from the left?

68
00:10:05,437 --> 00:10:08,463
Passionate. Camera. Passion.

69
00:10:08,573 --> 00:10:11,633
Right side, and, uh, with intensity.

70
00:10:11,743 --> 00:10:13,643
Okay?

71
00:10:13,745 --> 00:10:16,737
Is that everything? I mean, it seemed like he said quite a bit more than that.

72
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,750
Whiskey.

73
00:10:24,923 --> 00:10:27,016

- Okay. - Okay?

79
00:10:57,489 --> 00:11:00,287
For relaxing times,

80
00:11:00,392 --> 00:11:02,292
make it Suntory time.

81
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:06,091
Cut-o.! Cut-o, cut-o, cut-o, cut-o, cut-o.!

82
00:11:15,907 --> 00:11:18,102
Uh, could you do it slower...

83
00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:21,872
and with more... intensity?

Suntory time.

For relaxing times,

86
00:11:48,273 --> 00:11:50,468
make it Suntory time.

87
00:11:54,412 --> 00:11:56,903
Cut-o, cut-o, cut-o, cut-o.!

88
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,691

91
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:20,697
Hey. Oh, my God. How's Tokyo?

92
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,267
It's great here. It's really great.

93
00:13:23,368 --> 00:13:27,031
Um, I don't know... I went to this shrine today. Mm-hmm?

94
00:13:27,138 --> 00:13:29,333
And, um,

95
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:32,342
there were these monks and they were chanting.

96
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:36,403
And I didn't feel anything. You know?

97
00:13:36,514 --> 00:13:39,039
And, um, I don't know...

98
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:43,746
I even tried ikebana, and John is using these hair products.

99
00:13:43,855 --> 00:13:47,382
I just... I don't know who I married. Look, can you wait a second?

100
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:49,960
Just hold on. I'll be right back. Okay, sure.

101
00:13:50,995 --> 00:13:52,895
Sorry. What were you saying?

102
00:13:52,997 --> 00:13:55,397
Nothing. It's okay. I'll call you later. Okay?

103
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,401
Okay. Have the best time. Just call me when you get back.

104
00:13:58,503 --> 00:14:00,471
Bye. Love you. Bye.

[Mutters] God!

106
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:17,213
At the fitting today, they had all these...

107
00:15:17,315 --> 00:15:19,215
rock and roll clothes,

108
00:15:19,317 --> 00:15:21,717
but the band wasn't tough at all.

109
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,721
The label guy just kept saying, "More lock and loll,"

110
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:28,224
but it's just so much better if they're just skinny and nerdy like they came in, you know.

111
00:15:28,326 --> 00:15:31,818
They're making them wear all these Keith Richards clothes, and it's just ridiculous.

112
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,831
They should let them be who they are. Don't you think?

113
00:15:36,901 --> 00:15:38,835
Yeah, that's exactly what I was saying.

114
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:41,462
But then you try to... I mean, you know...

115
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:43,473
[Stammering] That's what I think.

116
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:45,543
Do you think this is done?

117
00:15:47,812 --> 00:15:50,713
[Stammers] I don't know. I don't know.

118
00:15:52,984 --> 00:15:56,579
Would you... Would you please stop smoking?

119
00:15:56,688 --> 00:15:59,020
I like to. I don't really smoke that much.

120
00:15:59,123 --> 00:16:01,387
It's just so bad for you, though.

121
00:16:01,492 --> 00:16:03,460
Well, I'll stop later.

122
00:16:16,007 --> 00:16:18,908

126
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,158
May I enter?

127
00:17:09,527 --> 00:17:11,495
Thank you.

128
00:17:11,596 --> 00:17:13,826
Do you like massage?

129
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:17,766
I don't think l... I like massage anymore.

130
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:21,703
Mr. Kazu sends premium fantasy.

131
00:17:21,806 --> 00:17:25,469
My stockings..."lip" them.

132
00:17:26,978 --> 00:17:30,937
[Giggles] "Lip" my stockings.

133
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:34,050
Yes, please.

134
00:17:34,152 --> 00:17:36,177
"Lip" them.

135
00:17:36,287 --> 00:17:38,187
What?

136
00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:40,257
"Lip" them.

137
00:17:41,926 --> 00:17:43,826
Hey! "Lip" my stocking!

138
00:17:43,928 --> 00:17:46,988
Hey! "Lip" them? "Lip" them? What?

139
00:17:47,098 --> 00:17:49,794
"Lip" them. Like this. "Lip" them.

140
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:51,801
Rip them? "Lip," yes.

141
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:54,804
You want me to rip your stockings? Yes, "lip" my stockings, please.

142
00:17:54,906 --> 00:17:58,307
Rip your stockings. You want me to rip your stockings. Yes. Please? Please? Please?

143
00:17:58,409 --> 00:18:02,345
All right, I'm gonna rip your stockings, and you tell Mr. Kazu we had a blast.

144
00:18:02,447 --> 00:18:04,972
Oh, no! Mr. Harris! Oh, my God!

145
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,983
Don't touch me!

146
00:18:07,085 --> 00:18:10,316
Mr. Bob Harris, don't touch me!

147
00:18:10,421 --> 00:18:12,321
Just "lip" my stocking!

148
00:18:12,423 --> 00:18:15,187
Oh, no, Mr. Harris!

149
00:18:15,293 --> 00:18:18,888
Oh, no! Help! Help! Yeah... Yeah.

150
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:20,897
Help, please! Help, please! Okay.

151
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,399
Mr. Harris, help, please. Careful with those.

152
00:18:23,501 --> 00:18:26,197
Oh! Help, please! Help, please! Come on. Come on.

153
00:18:26,304 --> 00:18:29,000
Let me go, Mr. Harris!

154
00:18:29,107 --> 00:18:31,337
Oh, no! Let me go! Come on. Come on.

155
00:18:31,442 --> 00:18:35,071
Ohh! Let me go! Let me go. Oh, crap.

Let me go, please!

161
00:19:34,972 --> 00:19:38,135
[Chuckles] Mr. Harris.! Good morning.

162
00:19:39,877 --> 00:19:43,779
We just got a request from Tanabe Mori. He is theJohnny Carson ofJapan.

163
00:19:43,881 --> 00:19:47,612
It is a big honor to be invited to his show.

164
00:19:47,718 --> 00:19:49,481
Can you stay here until Friday?

165
00:19:49,587 --> 00:19:53,387
Uh, I'm surprised and honored, but I think I need to check with my agent.

166
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:56,392
Okay. Mm-hmm. I believe I may have a previous commitment.

167
00:19:56,494 --> 00:19:58,394
Sure. I understand.

168
00:19:58,496 --> 00:20:00,464
Shall we go? Yes.

169
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:25,181
[Man On Phone] I think you should do it. No, hear this, Fred.

170
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:28,019
I gotta be on a plane Thursday night.

171
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:30,026
We're looking into it, Bob.

172
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:33,029
They really want you to stay and do that talk show.

173
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:35,031
Apparently, he's a really big deal...

174
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:37,829
Johnny Carson ofJapan. Yeah.

175
00:20:37,935 --> 00:20:41,336
Bob, these people are paying you a lot. Would you please consider it?

176
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:44,340
I already have. L-I gotta get out of here.

177
00:20:44,442 --> 00:20:46,342
As soon as I can.

178
00:20:46,444 --> 00:20:50,346
[Transmission Breaking Up] All right, you're scheduled to leave Friday, but we'll hold it for you Saturday.

179
00:20:50,448 --> 00:20:54,009
You're breaking up, Fred. There's no reception in this studio.

180
00:20:54,118 --> 00:20:56,086
Forget it. Call me back.

181
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:07,160
So, can you put your hand close your face, please?

182
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:08,892
I'm sorry, Naka. What?

183
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,630
Can you put your hand close your face?

184
00:21:16,974 --> 00:21:19,408
I don't get that close to the glass until I'm on the floor.

185
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,410
How's this? [Shutter Clicks]

186
00:21:21,512 --> 00:21:23,912
Yes. You want a whiskey?

187
00:21:26,617 --> 00:21:30,144
This is not whiskey. This is iced tea. If you gave me real whiskey...

188
00:21:30,254 --> 00:21:32,154
I need mysterious face.

189
00:21:32,256 --> 00:21:34,520
Can you show mysterious? Mysterious.

190
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:37,355
I think I know what you want. You want this, right?

191
00:21:37,461 --> 00:21:39,691
I need more mysterious and, uh...

192
00:21:39,797 --> 00:21:44,257
More mysterious. Yeah. I'll just try to think, "Where the hell's the whiskey?"

193
00:21:47,171 --> 00:21:49,935
You are a movie star, yes?

194
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:53,943
Yes, I should be doing movies, yes, but... And "Lat Pack."

195
00:21:54,045 --> 00:21:56,605
"Lat Pack." You know "Lat Pack"?

196
00:21:56,714 --> 00:21:58,614
Rat P... Rat Pack?

197
00:21:58,716 --> 00:22:01,014
Rat Pack. Yes, please. Oh, right, right.

198
00:22:06,324 --> 00:22:09,225
I need more tension, please. [Clicking Continues]

That's more of Dino. That's Dino. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Great.

Joey Bishop would you like? Yes. Just change film.

208
00:22:41,592 --> 00:22:43,389
Are you drinking? No?

209
00:22:43,494 --> 00:22:45,394
Am I drinking? As soon as I'm done.

210
00:22:45,496 --> 00:22:47,726
Okay, close your hand, please. Huh?

211
00:22:47,832 --> 00:22:49,732
Close your hand. Yeah... Close it?

Yes. Close your face, please.

00:22:51,836 --> 00:22:53,997

"Loger"Moore? "Loger" Moore.

00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:06,381
You know "Loger" Moore? Roger Moore?

Yeah. Okay. L... l...

- I always think of Sean Connery. Seriously. - No, no.

Excuse me, sir. From the woman over there.

Is Japan... Is it mainly Buddhism here?

243
00:24:48,986 --> 00:24:52,114
Yeah, it's Buddhism.

244
00:24:52,223 --> 00:24:54,123

245
00:24:54,225 --> 00:24:56,125

Oh, she plays... guitar? Guitar. Guitar.

00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:01,763
That's a beautiful job.

248
00:25:35,032 --> 00:25:36,932
Help!

Good morning. Good morning.

00:26:04,295 --> 00:26:06,263
Are you okay? Yeah. Fine.

253
00:26:13,604 --> 00:26:15,504
[Woman] That's what I told him.

254
00:26:15,673 --> 00:26:17,504
But if... Yeah.

255
00:26:17,608 --> 00:26:20,008
He never listens. Yeah.

256
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:23,871
John?

257
00:26:23,981 --> 00:26:27,280
Oh, my God! John! What are you doing here?

258
00:26:27,384 --> 00:26:31,445
Uh, oh, w-well, you know, uh, w... I'm just here, uh, shooting a band.

259
00:26:31,555 --> 00:26:34,115
What about you? I'm here promoting that action movie I did.

260
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:37,888
Hyah! You know! [Laughs] I'm doing 20 million interviews a day.

261
00:26:37,995 --> 00:26:39,895
It's crazy. Ohh!

262
00:26:39,997 --> 00:26:42,227
God, it is so good to see you! Yeah. Yeah.

263
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:45,791
So, how long are you gonna be here? We're here for a week.

264
00:26:45,903 --> 00:26:47,803
I'm gonna go shoot in Fukawaka.

265
00:26:47,905 --> 00:26:49,805
Ohh! Oh, it's amazing!

266
00:26:49,907 --> 00:26:51,841
Yeah. Oh. Oh, yeah. It's amazing.

267
00:26:55,145 --> 00:26:58,171
You know... Oh, this is... this is my wife, Charlotte.

268
00:26:58,282 --> 00:27:01,115
Hi! It's really nice to meet you! Hi. Nice to meet you.

269
00:27:01,218 --> 00:27:03,311
Hello! [Laughing] Yeah.!

270
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,547
Wife? [Laughing] Yeah. Yeah.

271
00:27:05,656 --> 00:27:07,886
John. John. Huh?

272
00:27:07,992 --> 00:27:09,892
You are my favorite photographer.

273
00:27:09,994 --> 00:27:12,986
Oh, come on! No, you are. I only want you to shoot me.

274
00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:16,999
It's true! [Laughs]

275
00:27:17,101 --> 00:27:19,592
I have the worst B.O. Right now. I'm so sorry.

276
00:27:19,703 --> 00:27:22,331
No, no, no. But, listen, um...

277
00:27:22,439 --> 00:27:25,203
- Let's all go out for a drink sometime. - Yeah.

278
00:27:25,309 --> 00:27:28,210
You know? Call me. Okay? Yeah. Okay.

279
00:27:28,312 --> 00:27:30,212
Listen, I'm under Evelyn Waugh.

280
00:27:30,314 --> 00:27:32,214
Oh, oh, oh. Shh. Okay?

281
00:27:33,984 --> 00:27:35,849
Okay, arigato, arigato.

282
00:27:35,953 --> 00:27:38,444
Aah! [Laughing] Moshi moshi.!

283
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:40,456
Evelyn Waugh?

284
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:42,788
What? Evelyn Waugh was a man.

285
00:27:42,893 --> 00:27:44,861
Oh, come on. She's nice.

286
00:27:46,063 --> 00:27:49,362
What? You know... You know, not everybody went to Yale.

287
00:27:50,467 --> 00:27:53,027
It was just a pseudonym, for Christ's sake.

288
00:27:53,137 --> 00:27:55,037
Why do you have to defend her?

289
00:27:55,139 --> 00:27:58,540
Well, why do you have to point out how stupid everybody is all the time?

290
00:27:58,642 --> 00:28:00,803
I thought it was funny. Forget it.

291
00:28:02,913 --> 00:28:06,314
Hey, John, we gotta go. Oh. Yeah.

292
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:13,953
[Man On Headphones] Did you ever wonder what your purpose in life is?

293
00:28:14,058 --> 00:28:17,619
This book is about finding your soul's purpose or destiny.

294
00:28:17,728 --> 00:28:21,494
Every soul has its path, but sometimes that path is not clear.

295
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:26,298
The Inner Map Theory is an example ofhow each soul begins with an imprint,

296
00:28:26,403 --> 00:28:32,272
all compacted into a pattern that has been selected by your soul...before you've even gotten here.

297
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:40,441
[Woman] You know, I guess the reason why I likeJapan the best...

298
00:28:40,551 --> 00:28:42,451
out of all Asian countries...

299
00:28:42,553 --> 00:28:47,252
is because I really feel close to, um, Buddhism.

300
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:49,588
I really feel... I really believe in reincarnation.

301
00:28:49,693 --> 00:28:52,594
That's part of what drew me to Midnight Velocity as well,

302
00:28:52,696 --> 00:28:56,223
because although Keanu dies,

303
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:58,233
he eventually gets reincarnated.

304
00:28:58,335 --> 00:29:01,930
So there's hope... There's hope in reincarnation, I think.

305
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:04,940
[Reporter] What was it like working with Keanu Reeves?

306
00:29:05,042 --> 00:29:08,478
He was always so... He was always, you know, giving me ideas...

307
00:29:08,579 --> 00:29:10,479
and, you know, really helpful.

308
00:29:10,581 --> 00:29:12,481
He made me feel really comfortable, so...

309
00:29:12,583 --> 00:29:16,280
And we both have two dogs, and we both live in L.A.,

310
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:19,550
so we have all these different things in common.

311
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:22,558
So, you know, we both really like Mexican food...

312
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,855
and yoga and...

313
00:29:24,962 --> 00:29:26,862
karate!

314
00:29:26,964 --> 00:29:30,900
[Reporters Laughing] [Woman Translating IntoJapanese] Mexican food. Yoga.

315
00:29:48,218 --> 00:29:50,948
Konnichi wa. Hello. Hi.

316
00:30:17,681 --> 00:30:21,742
Hai. Okay. Hai. Hai. Okay.

317
00:31:33,257 --> 00:31:36,488
He got married a couple of times...

318
00:31:36,593 --> 00:31:38,493
[Sighs] To some nice women.

319
00:31:38,595 --> 00:31:41,996
Beautiful women too. I mean, you and I would be crazy for these women.

320
00:31:42,099 --> 00:31:44,499
But there were always rumors.

321
00:31:44,601 --> 00:31:46,501
I never liked his acting,

322
00:31:46,603 --> 00:31:49,504
so I never gave a damn whether he was straight or not.

323
00:31:49,606 --> 00:31:52,507
Thank you... Hi. Thanks.

324
00:31:52,609 --> 00:31:54,509
What can I get you?

325
00:31:54,611 --> 00:31:57,205
Um, I'm not sure.

326
00:31:59,683 --> 00:32:02,277
For relaxing times, make it...

327
00:32:02,386 --> 00:32:04,354
[Bartender, Bob] Suntory time.

328
00:32:06,056 --> 00:32:08,786
Um, I'll have a vodka tonic.

329
00:32:08,892 --> 00:32:10,860
[Laughs] Thanks.

330
00:32:16,233 --> 00:32:18,201
So, what are you doing here?

331
00:32:19,336 --> 00:32:21,736
Uh, a couple of things.

332
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:25,502
Taking a break from my wife, forgetting my son's birthday,

333
00:32:25,609 --> 00:32:27,907
and, uh, getting paid $2 million...

334
00:32:28,011 --> 00:32:30,536
to endorse a whiskey...

335
00:32:30,647 --> 00:32:33,616
when I could be doing a play somewhere.

336
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:39,621
But the good news is, the whiskey works.

337
00:32:47,097 --> 00:32:49,497
What are you doing?

338
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,160
Um, my husband's a photographer,

339
00:32:52,269 --> 00:32:55,170
so he's here working and, uh,

340
00:32:55,272 --> 00:32:57,672
I wasn't doing anything, so I came along.

341
00:32:57,774 --> 00:33:01,676
And we have some friends that live here. How long have you been married?

342
00:33:01,778 --> 00:33:03,678
Oh, thank you.

343
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,613
Mmm. Two years.

344
00:33:06,717 --> 00:33:08,617
Twenty-five long ones.

345
00:33:11,121 --> 00:33:14,022
You're probably just having a midlife crisis.

346
00:33:14,124 --> 00:33:16,092
Did you buy a Porsche yet?

347
00:33:17,461 --> 00:33:20,225
You know, I was thinking about buying a Porsche.

348
00:33:24,067 --> 00:33:25,967
Twenty-five years.

349
00:33:26,069 --> 00:33:28,970
That's a... Well, it's impressive.

350
00:33:32,342 --> 00:33:35,903
Well, you figure you sleep one-third of your life.

351
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:38,709
That knocks off eight years of marriage right there.

352
00:33:38,815 --> 00:33:40,715
So you're down to 16 and change.

353
00:33:40,817 --> 00:33:42,717
You're just a teenager at marriage.

354
00:33:42,819 --> 00:33:46,152
You can drive it, but there's still the occasional accident.

355

What do you do?

356
00:33:55,098 --> 00:33:56,998
I'm not sure yet, actually.

357
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,830
I just graduated last spring.

358
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:01,768
What did you study?

359
00:34:01,872 --> 00:34:03,772
Philosophy.

Yeah, there's a good buck in that racket. [Laughs] Yeah.

Well, so far it's pro bono.

Well, I'm sure you'll figure out the angles. Yeah.

Really? Oh, really?

He, um, fought on the American side of the Bay of Pigs in Cuba.

He was taken prisoner, and the whole time he was there they tortured him about food.

395
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:58,034
Every day they told him they put poison in the food.

396
00:37:58,141 --> 00:38:00,837
So they would always make themselves throw up after every meal.

397
