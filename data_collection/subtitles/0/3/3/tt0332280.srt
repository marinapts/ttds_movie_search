1
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,735
Excuse me.

2
00:03:03,295 --> 00:03:06,415
Come on, honey, let's
get you ready for bed.

3
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,715
I am no one special,

4
00:03:20,755 --> 00:03:23,695
just a common man
with common thoughts.

5
00:03:23,725 --> 00:03:25,995
I've led a common life.

6
00:03:26,035 --> 00:03:27,935
There are no monuments
dedicated to me.

7
00:03:27,965 --> 00:03:31,065
And my name
will soon be forgotten.

8
00:03:31,105 --> 00:03:32,905
But in one respect,

9
00:03:32,935 --> 00:03:36,465
I've succeeded as gloriously
as anyone who ever lived.

10
00:03:36,505 --> 00:03:38,605
- Looking good, Duke.
- Feeling good.

11
00:03:38,645 --> 00:03:40,405
I've loved another
with all my heart

12
00:03:40,445 --> 00:03:44,475
and soul and for me
that has always been enough.

13
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,915
How's it hanging, Harry?

14
00:03:45,955 --> 00:03:48,645
I keep trying to die,
but they won't let me.

15
00:03:48,685 --> 00:03:50,715
Well, you can't
have everything.

16
00:03:53,895 --> 00:03:55,125
Big day today.

17
00:03:55,165 --> 00:03:57,855
You say that every day,
you old devil.

18
00:03:59,235 --> 00:04:01,195
It's a lovely day
outside.

19
00:04:01,235 --> 00:04:03,465
Let's take a walk.

20
00:04:03,505 --> 00:04:04,565
I don't think so.

21
00:04:04,605 --> 00:04:06,905
Well, we've got to get
you out of this room.

22
00:04:06,935 --> 00:04:08,535
Come on now, honey.
Some fresh air

23
00:04:08,575 --> 00:04:11,005
- would do you good.
- Hello.

24
00:04:12,815 --> 00:04:15,275
I'm sorry,
it's not a good day.

25
00:04:15,315 --> 00:04:17,285
I don't think
she's up for anything.

26
00:04:17,315 --> 00:04:18,475
Hello?

27
00:04:20,315 --> 00:04:24,315
This is Duke,
he's come to read to you.

28
00:04:24,355 --> 00:04:26,625
Read?

29
00:04:27,855 --> 00:04:30,695
No.
I don't know.

30
00:04:30,725 --> 00:04:34,795
Oh, come on,
you'll like him, he's very funny.

31
00:04:46,515 --> 00:04:47,845
Ahh...

32
00:04:49,285 --> 00:04:53,215
All right now,
where did we leave off?

33
00:04:53,255 --> 00:04:56,585
Oh, yeah, yeah,
it was the night of the carnival.

34
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:59,755
"Noah, was there with his friends,
Fin and Sarah."

35
00:04:59,795 --> 00:05:02,985
- Noah?
- That's where they met...

36
00:05:03,025 --> 00:05:05,125
June 6th, 1940.

37
00:05:06,565 --> 00:05:08,465
Allie was
17 years old.

38
00:05:09,005 --> 00:05:11,235
- Little man wins a prize.
- Damn!

39
00:05:11,275 --> 00:05:13,505
- Thank you for playing.
- Ha, you're real funny.

40
00:05:13,535 --> 00:05:14,805
Man, I clobbered
that thing.

41
00:05:14,845 --> 00:05:16,805
I'm tellin' you,
these games are fixed.

42
00:05:16,845 --> 00:05:18,465
- Hello.
- How are you?

43
00:05:18,515 --> 00:05:20,445
Hi, what's your name?

44
00:05:20,475 --> 00:05:22,175
Step right up here.

45
00:05:22,215 --> 00:05:24,405
Over the hook, yeah.

46
00:05:28,485 --> 00:05:31,515
- Who's this girl with Sara?
- Her name's Allie Hamilton.

47
00:05:31,555 --> 00:05:33,995
She's here for the summer
with her family.

48
00:05:34,025 --> 00:05:35,325
Dad's got more
money than God.

49
00:05:35,365 --> 00:05:37,455
- Hi, Fin!
- Hi, honey.

50
00:05:37,495 --> 00:05:40,295
Look, I won you a prize.

51
00:05:40,335 --> 00:05:43,665
Oh, Fin, thank you!

52
00:05:45,675 --> 00:05:48,075
- Oww!
- Yeah.

53
00:05:48,105 --> 00:05:49,865
Hey great, huh?

54
00:05:49,905 --> 00:05:51,735
Hey Allie, you want
some cotton candy?

55
00:05:51,775 --> 00:05:53,805
- Umm, okay.
- That would be so much fun.

56
00:05:55,645 --> 00:05:58,245
You only get
one chance, son.

57
00:05:58,285 --> 00:06:00,645
- You want to dance with me?
- No.

58
00:06:00,685 --> 00:06:03,815
- Why not?
- 'Cause I don't want to.

59
00:06:03,855 --> 00:06:06,845
Noah, she's with us.

60
00:06:06,895 --> 00:06:10,795
Hey Allie, you want
to ride the Ferris wheel?

61
00:06:10,825 --> 00:06:12,355
- I'd love to.
- All right.

62
00:06:12,395 --> 00:06:14,025
Excuse me.

63
00:06:15,305 --> 00:06:16,855
Excuse me.

64
00:06:20,935 --> 00:06:23,845
- Noah Calhoun.
- What?

65
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,635
Works down at the lumber yard
with Fin.

66
00:06:26,675 --> 00:06:28,835
Oh...

67
00:06:28,885 --> 00:06:31,845
Did you see he was standing like
two inches away from my face?

68
00:06:31,885 --> 00:06:34,015
Yeah, I saw.
That's Noah, though.

69
00:06:35,725 --> 00:06:37,275
You know I'm surprised
he even came over.

70
00:06:37,325 --> 00:06:38,655
I think he likes you.

71
00:06:58,775 --> 00:07:00,475
Hey what... jerk...

72
00:07:00,515 --> 00:07:03,875
Get off me.
Don't touch me.

73
00:07:03,915 --> 00:07:05,975
- Hey!
- Well, I... ugh!

74
00:07:06,015 --> 00:07:08,005
- What are you doing?
- Hey, you can't do that!

75
00:07:08,055 --> 00:07:09,745
I'll pay you
when I get down, Tommy.

76
00:07:09,785 --> 00:07:11,585
I'm Noah Calhoun.

77
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,715
- So?!
- So, it's really nice to meet you.

78
00:07:13,755 --> 00:07:16,315
- Allie, who is this guy?
- I don't know, Noah Calhoun.

79
00:07:16,365 --> 00:07:18,795
- I would really like to take you out.
- Friend! Do you mind?

80
00:07:20,535 --> 00:07:23,435
You can't sit more than two people
in a chair, Noah.

81
00:07:23,465 --> 00:07:24,935
Okay, Tommy,
all right.

82
00:07:27,975 --> 00:07:30,565
Get down, Noah,
you're gonna kill yourself!

83
00:07:30,605 --> 00:07:31,805
Noah, cut it out.

84
00:07:31,845 --> 00:07:33,505
Now, will you
go out with me?

85
00:07:33,545 --> 00:07:35,205
What?

86
00:07:35,245 --> 00:07:37,185
- No.
- No?

87
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,545
- No.
- No?

88
00:07:38,585 --> 00:07:40,245
Hey pal,
she just told you.

89
00:07:40,285 --> 00:07:41,375
Why not?

90
00:07:41,425 --> 00:07:43,415
I don't know,
because I don't want to.

91
00:07:43,455 --> 00:07:44,475
Noah!

92
00:07:44,525 --> 00:07:46,855
What? Well, you leave me
no other choice then.

93
00:07:47,955 --> 00:07:49,085
Oh my God.

94
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,115
I'm not kidding.

95
00:07:50,165 --> 00:07:51,895
- Noah, stop fooling around.
- What are you doing?

96
00:07:51,935 --> 00:07:54,335
- Noah, grab the bar.
- I'm gonna ask you one more time.

97
00:07:54,365 --> 00:07:55,955
Will you...

98
00:07:56,005 --> 00:07:58,735
- or will you not go out with me?
- Noah, you best come on.

99
00:07:58,775 --> 00:08:01,675
- God damn, my hand's slipping.
- Then grab the bar, you idiot.

100
00:08:01,705 --> 00:08:04,435
- Not until she agrees.
- Ah, go on out with him, honey.

101
00:08:04,475 --> 00:08:06,675
- Okay, okay, fine,
I'll go out with you.

102
00:08:06,715 --> 00:08:07,975
- What?
- No, don't do me any favors.

103
00:08:08,015 --> 00:08:09,345
No, no. I want to.

104
00:08:09,385 --> 00:08:10,715
- You want to? You want to?
- Yes!

105
00:08:10,745 --> 00:08:12,715
- Say it.
- I want to go out with you.

106
00:08:12,755 --> 00:08:15,345
- Say it again.
- I want to go out with you.

107
00:08:15,385 --> 00:08:17,715
All right, all right
we'll go out.

108
00:08:17,755 --> 00:08:20,525
You think
you're so smart, don't you?

109
00:08:20,555 --> 00:08:22,225
That wasn't funny,
Noah, you idiot!

110
00:08:22,265 --> 00:08:25,695
No, it's okay,
I'll take care of this.

111
00:08:25,735 --> 00:08:27,425
What are you doing?

112
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,455
Please don't do that.

113
00:08:28,505 --> 00:08:30,025
Please don't do that, Allie.

114
00:08:30,065 --> 00:08:31,795
I can't believe...

115
00:08:31,835 --> 00:08:33,465
Oh God.

116
00:08:35,305 --> 00:08:37,075
You're not so cocky now,
are ya?

117
00:08:37,105 --> 00:08:38,975
I'm gonna get you for that.

118
00:08:39,015 --> 00:08:41,415
Ah, maybe you will,
maybe you won't.

119
00:08:43,985 --> 00:08:47,285
- Did he say anything to you?
- Oh, yeah, will you look at that?

120
00:08:47,315 --> 00:08:49,215
It's that girl from the Carnival,
right?

121
00:08:51,825 --> 00:08:53,725
Do you remember me?

122
00:08:53,755 --> 00:08:56,245
Yeah, sure,
Mr. Underwear, was it?

123
00:08:56,295 --> 00:08:58,025
- Well, I...
- How could I forget.

124
00:08:58,065 --> 00:08:59,555
Yeah, I wanted to clear
that up with you,

125
00:08:59,595 --> 00:09:01,085
because
I'm really sorry about that.

126
00:09:01,135 --> 00:09:02,425
It was a really stupid thing
to do...

127
00:09:02,465 --> 00:09:04,055
crawl up a Ferris wheel
to talk to somebody.

128
00:09:04,105 --> 00:09:06,005
But I had
to be next to you.

129
00:09:06,035 --> 00:09:08,195
I was being
drawn to you.

130
00:09:11,245 --> 00:09:13,675
Oh... oh, jeez,
what a line!

131
00:09:13,715 --> 00:09:16,075
You use that
on all the girls?

132
00:09:16,115 --> 00:09:17,845
- No.
- Right.

133
00:09:17,885 --> 00:09:20,185
I saw you the other night
with little Miss Ribbons.

134
00:09:20,215 --> 00:09:21,875
- What are you doing tonight?
- What?

135
00:09:21,925 --> 00:09:23,945
Or tomorrow night,
or this weekend, whatever.

136
00:09:23,985 --> 00:09:25,925
- Why?
- Why? Our date.

137
00:09:25,955 --> 00:09:27,215
What date?

138
00:09:27,255 --> 00:09:28,985
- The date that you agreed to.
- No...

139
00:09:29,025 --> 00:09:31,225
Yes, you did.
You promised and you swore it.

140
00:09:31,265 --> 00:09:33,025
Well, I guess
I changed my mind.

141
00:09:34,635 --> 00:09:36,995
Look, I know you get some dirty guy
coming up to you

142
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,555
on the street...
you don't know him.

143
00:09:38,605 --> 00:09:40,435
You don't know me,
but I know me.

144
00:09:42,105 --> 00:09:43,835
And when I see something
that I like,

145
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,205
I gotta ha...
I love it.

146
00:09:46,245 --> 00:09:48,305
I go... I mean,
I go crazy for it.

147
00:09:48,345 --> 00:09:51,115
Okay, what are you
talking about?

148
00:09:51,145 --> 00:09:52,345
Well, you.

149
00:09:53,515 --> 00:09:55,215
Oh, you're good.

150
00:09:55,255 --> 00:09:56,885
- What?
- You're good.

151
00:09:56,925 --> 00:09:59,395
- No. No, you're getting me wrong.
- You're good. You are.

152
00:09:59,425 --> 00:10:00,945
- You're fantastic.
- I'm not.

153
00:10:00,995 --> 00:10:02,855
You really are.
I'm impressed.

154
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:06,195
- I'm not usually like this, I'm sorry.
- Oh, yes, you are.

155
00:10:06,235 --> 00:10:08,325
I can be fun,
if you want...

156
00:10:08,365 --> 00:10:11,855
pensive, uh, smart,

157
00:10:11,905 --> 00:10:14,635
uh, superstitious,
brave.

158
00:10:14,675 --> 00:10:17,605
And uh... I can be light on my feet.

159
00:10:17,645 --> 00:10:20,205
I could be
whatever you want.

160
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,975
You just tell me what you want
and I'll be that for you.

161
00:10:24,115 --> 00:10:25,545
You're dumb.

162
00:10:27,815 --> 00:10:29,185
I could be that.

163
00:10:32,095 --> 00:10:34,085
Come on, one date.
What's it gonna hurt?

164
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,785
Umm...
I don't think so.

165
00:10:35,825 --> 00:10:37,655
Well, what I can I do
to change your mind?

166
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,635
Guess you'll figure
something out.

167
00:10:41,635 --> 00:10:44,105
- You sure she's coming?
- Relax, pal, it's all set up.

168
00:10:44,135 --> 00:10:45,655
We're meeting her
for the late show.

169
00:10:45,705 --> 00:10:47,535
Look... what did
I tell you? Come on.

170
00:10:53,175 --> 00:10:56,615
Oh my goodness,
what a coincidence!

171
00:10:56,645 --> 00:10:58,375
I need to talk to you
for a second.

172
00:10:58,415 --> 00:11:02,185
- He's here!
- Allie, you remember Noah, don't you?

173
00:11:02,225 --> 00:11:03,205
- Yes, I remember.
- Yeah.

174
00:11:03,255 --> 00:11:05,185
- Come here.
- Fin!

175
00:11:05,225 --> 00:11:06,885
- Hi.
- Hi.

176
00:11:06,925 --> 00:11:09,255
- It's nice to see you again.
- You too.

177
00:11:09,295 --> 00:11:11,455
- You look great.
- Aw, thanks.

178
00:11:11,495 --> 00:11:13,195
Really, really great.

179
00:11:13,235 --> 00:11:14,925
You do look great.
You look great.

180
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:18,365
And I know I look great,
so could we please go see this movie?

181
00:11:18,405 --> 00:11:21,165
- The show's about to start.
- After you.

182
00:11:21,205 --> 00:11:23,835
You come back here,
Li'I Abner.

183
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,435
You ain't gonna catch me,
Daisy Mae!

184
00:11:26,475 --> 00:11:28,745
It's Sadie Hawkins Day,
I'm supposed to catch you!

185
00:11:28,785 --> 00:11:30,505
I'm faster than you.

186
00:11:32,515 --> 00:11:34,285
No, No!

187
00:11:34,315 --> 00:11:36,515
I'll get you!

188
00:11:37,685 --> 00:11:39,625
I'm going get...

189
00:11:39,655 --> 00:11:41,125
Here I come!

190
00:11:41,155 --> 00:11:43,655
You better run fast!

191
00:11:53,275 --> 00:11:55,265
You ketchum Polecat
far and squar.

192
00:12:01,545 --> 00:12:04,205
Wait for me.

193
00:12:04,245 --> 00:12:06,275
What happened
in that movie?

194
00:12:07,615 --> 00:12:09,785
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

195
00:12:11,255 --> 00:12:13,385
- What are you guys doing?
- Want to walk with me?

196
00:12:13,425 --> 00:12:14,415
Yeah, what's going on?

197
00:12:14,455 --> 00:12:15,895
- Yeah.
- We're gonna walk.

198
00:12:15,925 --> 00:12:18,415
Do you guys
love each other?

199
00:12:18,465 --> 00:12:20,765
Huh?
Oh, I get it.

200
00:12:20,795 --> 00:12:23,595
- You guys do love each other.
- Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

201
00:12:23,635 --> 00:12:24,725
Okay, good bye.

202
00:12:24,765 --> 00:12:27,265
All right, all right.

203
00:12:31,345 --> 00:12:33,405
That was fun.

204
00:12:35,345 --> 00:12:37,745
I haven't seen a movie
in ages.

205
00:12:37,785 --> 00:12:39,545
Really?

206
00:12:39,585 --> 00:12:42,385
Not since
I was a little kid.

207
00:12:42,425 --> 00:12:44,015
What?

208
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,855
No, I..

209
00:12:45,895 --> 00:12:48,485
I'm busy, you know,
I don't have a lot of time.

210
00:12:49,795 --> 00:12:51,225
You're busy?

211
00:12:51,265 --> 00:12:54,855
I have a very
strict schedule.

212
00:12:54,895 --> 00:12:56,665
My days are all
planned out.

213
00:12:56,705 --> 00:13:00,935
I get up in the morning... breakfast,
math tutor, Latin tutor, lunch,

214
00:13:00,975 --> 00:13:04,705
tennis lessons, dance lessons...
sometimes both...

215
00:13:04,745 --> 00:13:08,575
French tutor, piano lesson,
then I eat dinner.

216
00:13:08,615 --> 00:13:10,605
And after dinner
I spend time with my family.

217
00:13:10,645 --> 00:13:13,445
And then I... I catch up
on some reading.

218
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,925
Sounds like the road
to success.

219
00:13:20,955 --> 00:13:22,625
Oh, you bet.

220
00:13:22,665 --> 00:13:24,325
We're applying
to all these colleges...

221
00:13:24,365 --> 00:13:28,825
umm... Radcliffe, Sarah Lawrence...
those are the ones we want.

222
00:13:30,505 --> 00:13:33,405
- And who's we?
- What?

223
00:13:33,435 --> 00:13:35,535
You just said,
"The ones that we want."

224
00:13:35,575 --> 00:13:37,235
Oh, Mom and Daddy.

225
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,075
We decide
everything together.

226
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,645
Everything?

227
00:13:42,685 --> 00:13:44,345
No, not everything.

228
00:13:44,385 --> 00:13:46,115
But the important
things, yes.

229
00:13:47,715 --> 00:13:50,955
And then everything else,
you get to decide all by yourself?

230
00:13:52,795 --> 00:13:55,655
- Don't be rude.
- I'm sorry.

231
00:13:58,225 --> 00:14:01,285
Just trying to figure out
what you do for fun.

232
00:14:01,335 --> 00:14:04,195
What do you mean?

233
00:14:04,235 --> 00:14:06,605
I mean...

234
00:14:06,635 --> 00:14:08,235
I don't know,
I mean all those things

235
00:14:08,275 --> 00:14:10,835
are things you
have to do, right?

236
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:14,745
So what do you do
because you want to?

237
00:14:14,775 --> 00:14:16,905
I just told ya.

238
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:21,645
I don't know.

239
00:14:21,685 --> 00:14:24,175
This surprises me.

240
00:14:24,225 --> 00:14:25,515
Why?

241
00:14:25,555 --> 00:14:29,015
I just always figured
you were kinda...

242
00:14:29,065 --> 00:14:30,855
Kinda what?

243
00:14:30,895 --> 00:14:32,195
Just...

244
00:14:34,235 --> 00:14:37,065
- Free.
- What?

245
00:14:37,105 --> 00:14:38,625
Free.

246
00:14:40,905 --> 00:14:43,435
I am free.

247
00:14:43,475 --> 00:14:46,235
You don't seem like it.

248
00:14:46,275 --> 00:14:48,245
Well, I am.

249
00:14:50,385 --> 00:14:52,375
Come here,
I want to show you something.

250
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:56,085
- Noah, what are you doing?
- Just come on.

251
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:59,555
- You're gonna get run over.
- By all the cars?

252
00:15:07,335 --> 00:15:08,925
My Dad and I used
to come out here

253
00:15:08,965 --> 00:15:12,695
and lay down and watch
the lights change.

254
00:15:12,735 --> 00:15:15,725
And watch them go
from green to red to yellow.

255
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,135
You could try it,
if you wanted to.

256
00:15:20,175 --> 00:15:22,575
- No.
- Why not?

257
00:15:22,615 --> 00:15:25,375
Because I don't know...
will you just get up?

258
00:15:25,415 --> 00:15:27,815
That's your problem,
you know that?

259
00:15:29,155 --> 00:15:30,675
You don't do
what you want.

260
00:15:39,095 --> 00:15:40,625
Okay.

261
00:15:57,845 --> 00:15:59,815
What happens
if a car comes?

262
00:15:59,855 --> 00:16:01,545
- We die.
- What?

263
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,525
Just relax.
Just trust.

264
00:16:03,555 --> 00:16:05,985
You need to learn
how to trust.

265
00:16:07,695 --> 00:16:09,155
Okay.

266
00:16:12,235 --> 00:16:13,955
Painting.

267
00:16:13,995 --> 00:16:16,555
You asked me
what I do for me.

268
00:16:16,605 --> 00:16:20,335
- What now?
- I love to paint.

269
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:23,565
Yeah?

270
00:16:25,715 --> 00:16:29,645
Most of the time, I have all these
thoughts bouncing around in my head.

271
00:16:29,685 --> 00:16:32,985
But with a brush
in my hand,

272
00:16:33,015 --> 00:16:35,785
the world just gets
kinda quiet.

273
00:16:43,865 --> 00:16:45,525
Get out of the street!

274
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,395
Are you okay?

275
00:16:58,105 --> 00:17:00,205
Why are you laughing?

276
00:17:03,515 --> 00:17:05,945
Oh, that was fun.

277
00:17:10,355 --> 00:17:12,055
Do you want
to dance with me?

278
00:17:13,755 --> 00:17:14,785
Sure.

279
00:17:17,765 --> 00:17:19,325
Now?

280
00:17:19,365 --> 00:17:20,995
Here?

281
00:17:21,035 --> 00:17:23,625
Not supposed to dance
in the middle of the street.

282
00:17:23,665 --> 00:17:26,765
Who said dance
in the street?

283
00:17:26,805 --> 00:17:28,435
And we don't
have any music.

284
00:17:28,475 --> 00:17:30,945
Well,
we'll make some.

285
00:17:39,515 --> 00:17:42,315
# Bum bum #

286
00:17:42,355 --> 00:17:44,015
# Bum bum bum #

287
00:17:44,055 --> 00:17:45,925
# Bum #

288
00:17:45,955 --> 00:17:48,085
# Bum bum #

289
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,185
# Bum bum bum
bum bum. #

290
00:17:50,225 --> 00:17:52,195
You're a terrible singer.

291
00:17:52,235 --> 00:17:53,825
I know.

292
00:17:55,505 --> 00:17:57,265
But I like this song.

293
00:17:57,305 --> 00:18:04,075
# I'll be seeing you #

294
00:18:04,105 --> 00:18:07,305
# In all the old #

295
00:18:07,345 --> 00:18:10,675
# Familiar places #

296
00:18:12,215 --> 00:18:15,945
# That this heart
of mine #

297
00:18:15,985 --> 00:18:19,755
# Embraces #

298
00:18:19,795 --> 00:18:22,815
# All day
and through #

299
00:18:26,995 --> 00:18:34,835
# In that small cafe #

300
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:42,745
# The park
across the way #

301
00:18:42,785 --> 00:18:49,185
# The children's
carousel #

302
00:18:49,225 --> 00:18:51,585
- # The chestnut trees... #
- Southern summers

303
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,855
are indifferent
to the trials of young love.

304
00:18:53,895 --> 00:18:56,685
- # The wishing well #
- Armed with warnings and doubts,

305
00:18:56,725 --> 00:19:01,285
Noah and Allie gave a remarkably
convincing portrayal of a boy and a girl

306
00:19:01,335 --> 00:19:04,065
traveling down
a very long road

307
00:19:04,105 --> 00:19:06,295
with no regard
for the consequences.

308
00:19:06,335 --> 00:19:08,035
They fell in love,
didn't they?

309
00:19:08,075 --> 00:19:10,095
- Yes, they did.
- Good.

310
00:19:10,145 --> 00:19:12,805
I like this kind
of story. Go on.

311
00:19:18,285 --> 00:19:19,745
After that night,

312
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:22,985
Allie and Noah spent
every waking hour together.

313
00:19:23,025 --> 00:19:25,715
And soon
they were inseparable.

314
00:19:25,755 --> 00:19:28,625
- Noah, come on.
- Your boat cannot beat me there.

315
00:19:38,765 --> 00:19:40,965
That's really nice.

316
00:19:51,145 --> 00:19:52,985
"Beautiful dripping fragments.

317
00:19:53,015 --> 00:19:54,715
The negligent list

318
00:19:54,755 --> 00:19:56,945
of one after another,

319
00:19:56,985 --> 00:19:59,355
as I happen to call
them to me.

320
00:19:59,395 --> 00:20:01,255
Or drink to them.

321
00:20:01,295 --> 00:20:03,385
The real poems,
what we call poems,

322
00:20:03,425 --> 00:20:06,765
being merely pictures.
The poems of the privacy of the night.

323
00:20:06,795 --> 00:20:09,765
And of men like me.

324
00:20:09,805 --> 00:20:12,035
This poem,
drooping shy and unseen,

325
00:20:12,065 --> 00:20:15,265
that I always carry.
And that all men carry."

326
00:20:15,305 --> 00:20:17,535
Not bad for Whitman.

327
00:20:17,575 --> 00:20:20,235
Hey, look,
we got a visitor.

328
00:20:20,275 --> 00:20:23,115
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to interrupt.

329
00:20:23,145 --> 00:20:26,045
Well, don't apologize,
come on up here, darling.

330
00:20:26,085 --> 00:20:29,315
We could use a little something here
besides the smell of lumber.

331
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:32,485
Dad,
this is Allison Hamilton.

332
00:20:32,525 --> 00:20:34,045
Allison,
I'm glad to meet you.

333
00:20:34,095 --> 00:20:35,285
- Allie.
- Allie.

334
00:20:35,325 --> 00:20:36,755
Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Calhoun.

335
00:20:36,795 --> 00:20:39,025
Well Mr. Calho...
What, am I old or something?

336
00:20:39,065 --> 00:20:40,655
You can call me Frank.

337
00:20:40,695 --> 00:20:42,725
- Here, come in and have a seat.
- Okay.

338
00:20:43,905 --> 00:20:46,495
So, Allie.
Well, yeah, she is pretty, son.

339
00:20:46,535 --> 00:20:49,235
- Yes.
- She's a lot prettier than you let on.

340
00:20:49,275 --> 00:20:51,245
- Oh, is that right?
- No, it's not right.

341
00:20:51,275 --> 00:20:52,505
Don't believe what he says.

342
00:20:52,545 --> 00:20:55,135
- What is this you got?
- Umm, I... uh, I just...

343
00:20:55,175 --> 00:20:56,475
I brought you something.

344
00:20:56,515 --> 00:20:59,575
Let me see.
Let's have a look.

345
00:20:59,615 --> 00:21:01,645
Did you do this?

346
00:21:01,685 --> 00:21:03,485
Well, that's beautiful.
Look at that.

347
00:21:03,525 --> 00:21:05,185
That's a damn picture there.

348
00:21:06,655 --> 00:21:09,425
Well, I know just where we can
put that, thank you.

349
00:21:09,465 --> 00:21:12,055
Oh, that was
a lovely poem.

350
00:21:12,095 --> 00:21:13,655
What was it?

351
00:21:13,695 --> 00:21:15,295
- EI...
- Whitman.

352
00:21:15,335 --> 00:21:18,865
See when he was a little kid
he used to stutter real bad.

353
00:21:18,905 --> 00:21:21,465
- Dad...
- So... well, you did.

354
00:21:21,505 --> 00:21:23,565
- I didn't know that.
- God. I stammered.

355
00:21:23,605 --> 00:21:25,045
Stammered, stutter,
what's the difference?

356
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,845
Couldn't understand
a damn thing he said.

357
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:31,175
So, I got him to read me poetry
out loud.

358
00:21:31,215 --> 00:21:32,685
It wasn't
very pretty at first,

359
00:21:32,715 --> 00:21:33,975
but then his stutter
went away.

360
00:21:34,015 --> 00:21:35,915
Well, it's a good idea,
that poetry.

361
00:21:35,955 --> 00:21:37,475
Yeah, I thought so.

362
00:21:37,525 --> 00:21:40,285
Unbelievable,
unbelievable.

363
00:21:40,325 --> 00:21:42,795
I'm a Tennyson man,
myself, but he likes Whitman...

364
00:21:42,825 --> 00:21:44,695
For some reason,
I don't know.

365
00:21:44,725 --> 00:21:47,255
Say, how would you like some breakfast?
Would you like some breakfast?

366
00:21:47,295 --> 00:21:48,785
- Breakfast?
- Yeah.

367
00:21:48,835 --> 00:21:51,235
- Dad, it's 10:00.
- What's that got to do with it?

368
00:21:51,265 --> 00:21:53,565
You can have pancakes
any damn time of night you want.

369
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:56,505
- Come on, you want some breakfast?
- Sure.

370
00:21:57,845 --> 00:22:01,005
It was an improbable romance.

371
00:22:01,045 --> 00:22:04,875
He was a country boy.
She was from the city.

372
00:22:04,915 --> 00:22:06,645
She had the world
at her feet,

373
00:22:06,685 --> 00:22:08,875
while he didn't have
two dimes to rub together.

374
00:22:13,725 --> 00:22:15,245
Noah, come on.

375
00:22:16,365 --> 00:22:17,415
Whoo!

376
00:22:18,425 --> 00:22:19,655
Look at us.

377
00:22:22,305 --> 00:22:23,565
What are we doing?

378
00:22:23,605 --> 00:22:26,465
Do you think in another life,
I could have been a bird?

379
00:22:28,535 --> 00:22:29,665
What do you mean?

380
00:22:29,705 --> 00:22:31,835
Like reincarnation.

381
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:34,745
I don't know.

382
00:22:34,775 --> 00:22:36,335
I think I could.

383
00:22:42,755 --> 00:22:43,985
Say I'm a bird.

384
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:46,645
No.

385
00:22:46,695 --> 00:22:48,715
- Don't do it.
- Say I'm a bird.

386
00:22:48,755 --> 00:22:50,725
- Stop it. Stop it now.

387
00:22:50,765 --> 00:22:52,525
- You're not.
- Say it!

388
00:22:54,495 --> 00:22:57,055
- You're a bird.
- Yeah.

389
00:23:02,745 --> 00:23:04,605
Now say
you're a bird too.

390
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:09,505
If you're a bird,
I'm a bird.

391
00:23:43,045 --> 00:23:45,205
- Come on, darling.
- What are you doing?

392
00:23:45,245 --> 00:23:46,945
Don't.
Don't!

393
00:23:56,995 --> 00:23:58,625
Here we go,
on the count of three, okay?

394
00:23:58,665 --> 00:24:01,155
Real easy,
on three, ready?

395
00:24:01,195 --> 00:24:02,755
- Okay, okay.
- One...

396
00:24:02,805 --> 00:24:05,065
- Two... two...
- two...

397
00:24:05,105 --> 00:24:06,665
...three!
- No! I can't.

398
00:24:06,705 --> 00:24:08,895
Get in the water!

399
00:24:08,935 --> 00:24:11,105
- Get in! I'm sorry.
- Come on, chicken.

400
00:24:11,145 --> 00:24:13,075
Get in the water, baby.
Baby, would you get in.

401
00:24:13,115 --> 00:24:15,105
- Get in the water.
- I can't.

402
00:24:15,145 --> 00:24:16,615
- Go!
- Get in the water!

403
00:24:16,645 --> 00:24:17,945
- One...
- Come on, jump.

404
00:24:17,985 --> 00:24:20,045
- Two...
- Three.

405
00:24:30,995 --> 00:24:33,255
Keep 'em together!
No, no, no.

406
00:24:33,295 --> 00:24:35,195
- Get to your place.
- Down here.

407
00:24:35,235 --> 00:24:37,705
And move.
And keep it.

408
00:24:37,735 --> 00:24:38,725
No, don't move it!

409
00:24:38,765 --> 00:24:40,635
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

410
00:24:40,675 --> 00:24:43,135
They didn't agree on much.

411
00:24:43,175 --> 00:24:45,975
In fact, they rarely agreed on
everything. They fought all the time.

412
00:24:46,015 --> 00:24:47,605
- Don't kick me!
- Don't push me.

413
00:24:47,645 --> 00:24:50,045
And they challenged
each other every day.

414
00:24:50,085 --> 00:24:52,135
But despite
their differences,

415
00:24:52,185 --> 00:24:55,115
they had one
important thing in common.

416
00:24:55,155 --> 00:24:57,785
They were crazy
about each other.

417
00:24:59,855 --> 00:25:01,185
Okay,
I have to go.

418
00:25:01,225 --> 00:25:03,285
- No.
- Yes, I do.

419
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:18,335
Allie.

420
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:21,675
Daddy.
Oh, Daddy you're...

421
00:25:21,715 --> 00:25:22,735
I didn't see you there.

422
00:25:24,715 --> 00:25:25,705
You kinda scared me.

423
00:25:29,055 --> 00:25:31,025
Becoming friendly
with that boy down there.

424
00:25:33,725 --> 00:25:34,855
Yes.

425
00:25:36,165 --> 00:25:37,755
Bring him
to the house on Sunday.

426
00:25:37,795 --> 00:25:39,765
I want to meet
this young man.

427
00:25:39,795 --> 00:25:42,565
Okay.

428
00:25:42,605 --> 00:25:43,765
Good night, Daddy.

429
00:25:43,805 --> 00:25:45,795
Good night.

430
00:25:52,615 --> 00:25:53,775
Oh, boy.

431
00:25:53,815 --> 00:25:55,575
This bug goes
"Daddy, I don't understand."

432
00:25:55,615 --> 00:26:00,055
He goes, "Well, in theory,
we're both millionaires, but in reality,

433
00:26:00,085 --> 00:26:01,605
we live with
a bunch of whores."

434
00:26:06,095 --> 00:26:07,645
Bishop Stevens
told me that.

435
00:26:07,695 --> 00:26:11,285
Olivier, please remove the... the liquor
decanter from in front of my husband.

436
00:26:11,325 --> 00:26:12,725
I think he's had
a little too much to drink.

437
00:26:12,765 --> 00:26:15,425
- I don't get it.
- Pay attention.

438
00:26:15,465 --> 00:26:18,025
So, what do
you do, Noah?

439
00:26:18,065 --> 00:26:20,935
I work at the lumber yard
with Fin.

440
00:26:20,975 --> 00:26:25,105
Mainly milling and receiving logs...
and stripping the bark.

441
00:26:25,145 --> 00:26:26,635
Oh, that's lovely, dear.

442
00:26:26,675 --> 00:26:28,375
Thank you.

443
00:26:28,415 --> 00:26:30,935
If you don't mind my asking, uh,
how much do you make at your job?

444
00:26:30,985 --> 00:26:32,775
Uh, how much money
do I make?

445
00:26:34,755 --> 00:26:37,315
About 40 cents an hour.

446
00:26:39,995 --> 00:26:42,925
Yeah, it's not much,
but I don't need a lot.

447
00:26:42,965 --> 00:26:45,085
And I...
I save most of it.

448
00:26:46,895 --> 00:26:48,425
Let's eat. Shall we?

449
00:26:48,465 --> 00:26:51,595
Yes! Oh,
it looks delicious.

450
00:26:54,075 --> 00:26:57,335
So Noah, you and Allie have been
spending a lot of time together.

451
00:26:58,975 --> 00:27:01,415
You must be very fond
of each other.

452
00:27:03,245 --> 00:27:05,575
It's getting
pretty serious, huh?

453
00:27:05,615 --> 00:27:07,345
Yes, ma'am.

454
00:27:07,385 --> 00:27:11,615
Well, summer's almost gone.
What will you do?

455
00:27:11,655 --> 00:27:14,285
You know, Charleston's
only a couple of hours away.

456
00:27:16,465 --> 00:27:18,455
But Allie's going
to Sarah Lawrence.

457
00:27:20,365 --> 00:27:21,925
Didn't she tell you?

458
00:27:21,965 --> 00:27:24,095
No, she didn't
tell me that.

459
00:27:26,435 --> 00:27:28,665
I just got the letter.
I was going to tell you.

460
00:27:28,705 --> 00:27:29,735
It's okay.

461
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:32,935
And Sarah Lawrence
is in New York.

462
00:27:37,485 --> 00:27:38,675
I didn't know that.

463
00:27:40,015 --> 00:27:43,455
Anne, this conversation's
too stuffy for the dinner table.

464
00:27:43,485 --> 00:27:46,825
Let the children have fun without
bringing in the Spanish Inquisition.

465
00:27:46,855 --> 00:27:49,015
My lips are buttoned,
right now.

466
00:27:49,055 --> 00:27:52,585
I do know another joke about the Nun
and the full standing bishop.

467
00:27:53,935 --> 00:27:54,925
- Stop
- That wasn't me.

468
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:57,095
I'm leaving the table
if you tell another joke.

469
00:27:59,775 --> 00:28:01,135
Whoo!

470
00:28:01,175 --> 00:28:02,435
I'm gonna do it.

471
00:28:02,475 --> 00:28:04,465
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

472
00:28:10,185 --> 00:28:13,415
That child's got too much spirit for
a girl of her circumstance.

473
00:28:13,455 --> 00:28:16,475
Nah, it's just
summer love.

474
00:28:16,525 --> 00:28:18,115
Trouble
is what it is.

475
00:28:43,045 --> 00:28:44,775
Is that Allie
out there?

476
00:28:46,485 --> 00:28:49,285
Do you want
to go somewhere?

477
00:28:51,585 --> 00:28:52,615
Okay.

478
00:28:58,065 --> 00:28:59,355
Wait here.

479
00:29:20,015 --> 00:29:21,385
Allie!

480
00:29:23,325 --> 00:29:24,545
Come on.

481
00:29:28,755 --> 00:29:30,625
All right,
take a step.

482
00:29:30,665 --> 00:29:33,065
Step. No, don't...

483
00:29:34,635 --> 00:29:36,395
All right,
just stay there.

484
00:29:36,435 --> 00:29:38,595
Don't open
your eyes.

485
00:29:45,305 --> 00:29:47,175
Okay.

486
00:29:47,215 --> 00:29:49,445
The Windsor Plantation.

487
00:29:49,485 --> 00:29:52,005
It was built in 1772.

488
00:29:52,045 --> 00:29:54,345
Rumor has it that Francis Marion...

489
00:29:54,385 --> 00:29:57,515
Proposed to his wife right here under
these... uh, these steps.

490
00:29:58,685 --> 00:30:00,175
- Huh?
- Watch out.

491
00:30:00,225 --> 00:30:02,285
You be careful, these are broken.
Look at that.

492
00:30:02,325 --> 00:30:04,295
This...

493
00:30:04,325 --> 00:30:06,095
This place is gigantic.

494
00:30:06,135 --> 00:30:08,295
Yeah, a gigantic
piece of crap.

495
00:30:08,335 --> 00:30:10,805
It is.

496
00:30:10,835 --> 00:30:13,995
But I'm gonna buy it one day
and I'm gonna fix it up.

497
00:30:14,035 --> 00:30:15,805
All it needs
is a new floor.

498
00:30:16,975 --> 00:30:18,705
And new walls
and a roof.

499
00:30:18,745 --> 00:30:21,805
- Is that all?
- And plumbing and electric.

500
00:30:21,845 --> 00:30:24,315
- And furniture.
- Yes, and furniture.

501
00:30:24,345 --> 00:30:25,945
But it's right
on the water.

502
00:30:25,985 --> 00:30:27,785
And there's a big
old barn out there...

503
00:30:27,815 --> 00:30:29,975
I could turn that
into my workshop.

504
00:30:30,025 --> 00:30:32,115
Well, what about me?

505
00:30:32,155 --> 00:30:33,645
Now don't I get
any say in this?

506
00:30:35,995 --> 00:30:37,725
You want a say in this?

507
00:30:37,765 --> 00:30:40,555
Yes, I would.

508
00:30:40,595 --> 00:30:41,925
What do you want?

509
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,225
I want
a white house...

510
00:30:43,265 --> 00:30:45,925
with blue shutters...

511
00:30:45,965 --> 00:30:48,635
And a room overlooking
the river so I can paint.

512
00:30:49,675 --> 00:30:51,165
- Anything else?
- Yes.

513
00:30:51,205 --> 00:30:55,115
I want a big old porch that
wraps around the entire house.

514
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:56,845
We can drink tea...

515
00:30:56,885 --> 00:30:58,605
and watch
the sun go down.

516
00:31:00,485 --> 00:31:02,745
- Okay.
- You promise?

517
00:31:02,785 --> 00:31:05,255
Mm-hmm,
I promise.

518
00:31:05,285 --> 00:31:06,625
Good.

519
00:31:08,155 --> 00:31:10,425
- Where are you going?
- In here.

520
00:32:00,345 --> 00:32:03,835
I can't play chopsticks
if you're doing that.

521
00:32:22,735 --> 00:32:25,135
Oh, God.

522
00:32:25,165 --> 00:32:27,065
Oh, make love to me.

523
00:34:21,755 --> 00:34:22,915
- Noah.
- Yeah?

524
00:34:22,955 --> 00:34:25,515
Um...

525
00:34:25,555 --> 00:34:27,925
I know I said that I wanted you
to make love to me,

526
00:34:27,955 --> 00:34:29,155
- but I think you...
- Yeah?

527
00:34:29,195 --> 00:34:31,385
You're gonna have
to talk me through this.

528
00:34:33,595 --> 00:34:36,125
- Right. You all right?
- Yeah.

529
00:34:36,165 --> 00:34:37,895
- Did I hurt you?
- No, no.

530
00:34:37,935 --> 00:34:40,765
I'm just...
I'm just having a lot of thoughts.

531
00:34:40,805 --> 00:34:44,105
I'm just...
I'm just having a lot of...

532
00:34:44,145 --> 00:34:45,235
never mind.

533
00:34:51,685 --> 00:34:54,655
Like what are you thinking?
What are you thinking, right now?

534
00:34:54,685 --> 00:34:56,515
You know,
right this second?

535
00:34:58,625 --> 00:35:02,145
Did you know that this was going
to happen when you brought me here?

536
00:35:02,195 --> 00:35:03,425
- No.
- No?

537
00:35:03,465 --> 00:35:06,915
- No.
- No, you didn't think about it?

538
00:35:06,965 --> 00:35:09,265
- Of course I thought about it.
- You did?

539
00:35:09,295 --> 00:35:12,025
- Uh-huh.
- Well, what did you think?

540
00:35:12,065 --> 00:35:14,195
Uh, I'm talking
too much, aren't I?

541
00:35:14,235 --> 00:35:16,965
Okay, okay,
I'm just going to shut up.

542
00:35:17,005 --> 00:35:18,495
Mum's the word.

543
00:35:18,545 --> 00:35:20,975
Okay.

544
00:35:21,015 --> 00:35:23,985
- You all right?
- Yeah.

545
00:35:24,015 --> 00:35:26,415
- Uh-huh.
- All right.

546
00:35:26,455 --> 00:35:30,045
I just don't understand
how come you're so quiet.

547
00:35:30,085 --> 00:35:32,645
You don't have
one thought?

548
00:35:32,685 --> 00:35:34,085
I'm going crazy
over here,

549
00:35:34,125 --> 00:35:36,525
but no, with you,
everything's fine.

550
00:35:36,565 --> 00:35:38,465
You don't have
a care in the world?

551
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:48,305
I'm sorry.

552
00:35:48,335 --> 00:35:51,065
I wanted this
to be so perfect.

553
00:35:51,105 --> 00:35:53,235
Now I can't shut up.

554
00:35:56,045 --> 00:35:57,515
I love you.

555
00:35:59,915 --> 00:36:01,575
Did you know that?

556
00:36:16,395 --> 00:36:17,885
I love you too.

557
00:36:26,445 --> 00:36:27,565
Yeah.

558
00:36:33,715 --> 00:36:37,385
You don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

559
00:36:37,425 --> 00:36:40,755
No, no, I want to,
I do.

560
00:36:41,795 --> 00:36:43,695
Noah!
Noah!

561
00:36:43,725 --> 00:36:46,385
What? Fin,
get out of here!

562
00:36:46,425 --> 00:36:48,825
Look, I'm sorry,
but Allie's parents are going crazy.

563
00:36:48,865 --> 00:36:50,765
They got every cop in town
out looking for her.

564
00:37:03,845 --> 00:37:06,375
- You sent the police for me?
- Yes.

565
00:37:06,415 --> 00:37:08,685
It is two in the morning.
We sent the police.

566
00:37:08,715 --> 00:37:11,915
Thank God you're all right.
Where you been?

567
00:37:11,955 --> 00:37:13,985
Mr. Hamilton,
all this is my fault.

568
00:37:14,025 --> 00:37:15,955
Would you give us
a moment please?

569
00:37:15,995 --> 00:37:18,895
I'd like to talk
to my daughter.

570
00:37:18,925 --> 00:37:20,695
Alone, young lady.

571
00:37:27,275 --> 00:37:29,635
Thanks for everything,
Lieutenant.

572
00:37:29,675 --> 00:37:31,765
You bet, John, anytime.

573
00:37:31,805 --> 00:37:34,295
You go straight home now,
it's late.

574
00:37:40,915 --> 00:37:42,545
Sir, it's really
not her fault.

575
00:37:42,585 --> 00:37:44,885
I lost track
of time.

576
00:37:45,885 --> 00:37:48,225
Sit down.

577
00:37:57,865 --> 00:37:59,455
I'm sorry, Daddy.

578
00:38:03,375 --> 00:38:06,275
- Is he a rapist?
- No.

579
00:38:11,715 --> 00:38:15,945
- Like what, mother?
- You are going to stop seeing Noah.

580
00:38:15,985 --> 00:38:18,755
She is out fooling around
with that boy till 2:00 in the morning

581
00:38:18,785 --> 00:38:21,085
and it has got
to stop.

582
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:22,885
I didn't spend
17 years of my life

583
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:26,195
raising a daughter
and giving her everything...

584
00:38:26,225 --> 00:38:28,065
so she could throw it away
on a summer romance.

585
00:38:28,095 --> 00:38:29,085
Daddy, come on!

586
00:38:29,135 --> 00:38:31,105
She will wind up with her
heart broken or pregnant.

587
00:38:31,135 --> 00:38:32,825
- Anne, please.
- Now, he is a nice boy.

588
00:38:32,865 --> 00:38:36,805
- He's a nice boy, but he's...
- He's what? He's what? Tell me.

589
00:38:36,845 --> 00:38:39,035
He is trash, trash, trash...
not for you.

590
00:38:39,075 --> 00:38:41,275
Trash?

591
00:38:50,685 --> 00:38:52,315
Don't touch me!

592
00:38:54,025 --> 00:38:56,785
Now that is enough. You are not to see
him anymore. And that's final.

593
00:38:56,825 --> 00:38:58,295
- No, it's not final.
- Yes it is.

594
00:38:58,325 --> 00:38:59,815
- No, it's not final!
- Allie!

595
00:38:59,865 --> 00:39:02,265
You're not going to tell me
who I'm gonna love.

596
00:39:02,295 --> 00:39:05,965
- Love?
- Yes Daddy, I love him.

597
00:39:06,005 --> 00:39:08,695
I love him.

598
00:39:08,735 --> 00:39:10,725
He's not suitable
for you, baby.

599
00:39:23,555 --> 00:39:25,385
I love him.

600
00:39:25,425 --> 00:39:27,855
You are 17 years old,
you don't know anything about love.

601
00:39:27,895 --> 00:39:29,855
Oh, and you do?

602
00:39:29,895 --> 00:39:32,155
You don't look at Daddy
the way I look at Noah.

603
00:39:32,195 --> 00:39:34,095
You don't touch
or laugh.

604
00:39:34,135 --> 00:39:37,295
You don't play.
You don't know anything about love.

605
00:39:38,305 --> 00:39:40,235
Noah?

606
00:39:40,275 --> 00:39:41,735
Noah?

607
00:39:44,075 --> 00:39:46,405
Hey, hey.

608
00:39:46,445 --> 00:39:48,105
You leaving?

609
00:39:50,345 --> 00:39:53,185
Oh my God,
I'm so sorry.

610
00:39:53,215 --> 00:39:56,705
I don't even know what to say.
I'm humiliated.

611
00:39:56,755 --> 00:39:58,815
- It's all right.
- No, it's not.

612
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:00,945
- Yeah.
- No, it's not.

613
00:40:08,295 --> 00:40:10,695
No.

614
00:40:16,275 --> 00:40:18,575
- I'm gonna go.
- No, I don't want you to go.

615
00:40:18,605 --> 00:40:20,805
I got to think
about some stuff.

616
00:40:20,845 --> 00:40:23,335
What do you
got to think about, huh?

617
00:40:23,385 --> 00:40:25,285
Come here
and talk to me.

618
00:40:25,315 --> 00:40:26,875
Talk to me!

619
00:40:26,915 --> 00:40:28,885
About what?
You want...

620
00:40:28,915 --> 00:40:30,685
you're going away!

621
00:40:32,325 --> 00:40:34,485
You're leaving.

622
00:40:34,525 --> 00:40:37,155
And I'm staying here.

623
00:40:37,195 --> 00:40:39,855
And I'm so happy
that you're doing it,

624
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:42,295
but you're gonna have
a million things to do.

625
00:40:42,335 --> 00:40:44,025
- No.
- You got so much ahead of you.

626
00:40:44,065 --> 00:40:46,005
- Don't talk like that.
- It's true.

627
00:40:46,035 --> 00:40:49,865
I'm not going to have
nice things, fancy things.

628
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:52,395
It doesn't...

629
00:40:52,445 --> 00:40:54,965
It's never gonna happen for me.
It's not in the cards for me.

630
00:40:55,015 --> 00:40:56,845
I don't have
to go to school, okay?

631
00:40:56,885 --> 00:40:58,505
- Yes, you do.
- I can stay here.

632
00:40:58,545 --> 00:41:01,015
No. Do you see, that's exactly
what I am talking about.

633
00:41:01,055 --> 00:41:02,385
Then you can
come with me.

634
00:41:03,685 --> 00:41:05,845
- To New York?
- Yes.

635
00:41:07,725 --> 00:41:09,485
What am I going
to do in New York?

636
00:41:11,995 --> 00:41:13,465
Be with me?

637
00:41:18,565 --> 00:41:20,265
Yeah.

638
00:41:23,035 --> 00:41:24,665
I don't know.

639
00:41:29,475 --> 00:41:32,035
We don't got to figure all this
out tonight, ya know?

640
00:41:32,085 --> 00:41:34,645
We'll finish out the summer and we'll
see what happens.

641
00:41:35,985 --> 00:41:37,815
You saying you want
to break it off?

642
00:41:37,855 --> 00:41:40,725
What I'm saying we see how it goes
later on.

643
00:41:47,135 --> 00:41:49,655
Are you breaking up
with me?

644
00:41:52,305 --> 00:41:54,235
I don't see
how it's gonna work.

645
00:41:56,875 --> 00:41:58,205
I see...

646
00:41:59,775 --> 00:42:02,145
Please don't do this.

647
00:42:02,175 --> 00:42:03,645
You don't mean it.

648
00:42:04,985 --> 00:42:07,275
Oh hell, well if you're
going to do it,

649
00:42:07,315 --> 00:42:09,345
why wait until
the summer ends, huh?

650
00:42:09,385 --> 00:42:11,615
Why don't you
just do it, right now?

651
00:42:13,385 --> 00:42:14,655
Come on.

652
00:42:14,695 --> 00:42:16,025
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

653
00:42:16,055 --> 00:42:18,115
Do it!
Do it!

654
00:42:18,165 --> 00:42:19,825
Do it right now.

655
00:42:19,865 --> 00:42:22,595
Do it!

656
00:42:22,635 --> 00:42:23,755
Stop it!

657
00:42:23,805 --> 00:42:25,025
Oh!

658
00:42:25,065 --> 00:42:27,765
You know what? I'm gonna do it.
It's over.

659
00:42:27,805 --> 00:42:29,775
Okay? It's over.

660
00:42:29,805 --> 00:42:32,295
- Come here.
- Don't touch me.

661
00:42:32,345 --> 00:42:34,335
I hate you,
I hate you.

662
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:35,635
I'm gonna go.

663
00:42:35,675 --> 00:42:38,165
Why don't you, why don't you
just go. Get out.

664
00:42:38,215 --> 00:42:41,915
Leave!
Go! Go!

665
00:42:43,725 --> 00:42:46,415
No, no, just wait a minute. We're not
really breaking up, are we?

666
00:42:46,455 --> 00:42:47,515
Come on.

667
00:42:47,555 --> 00:42:49,085
This is just a fight
we're having,

668
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:52,185
and tomorrow it will be
like it never happened, right?

669
00:42:57,805 --> 00:43:00,365
- Going?
- Gone.

670
00:43:00,405 --> 00:43:02,205
Well, she must have
been devastated.

671
00:43:02,235 --> 00:43:03,565
She was.

672
00:43:03,605 --> 00:43:05,475
He was only trying
to do the right thing.

673
00:43:05,505 --> 00:43:06,995
Yeah.

674
00:43:07,045 --> 00:43:08,845
But what he really should have done

675
00:43:08,875 --> 00:43:10,675
is just told those parents
to go to hell.

676
00:43:10,715 --> 00:43:12,545
Just stick it
where the sun don't shine.

677
00:43:12,585 --> 00:43:15,675
Yeah, you're right,
probably should have.

678
00:43:17,325 --> 00:43:19,615
The next day,
Allie woke up

679
00:43:19,655 --> 00:43:22,185
to find her world
completely changed.

680
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,505
What's going on?

681
00:43:31,535 --> 00:43:33,295
We're going home.

682
00:43:34,405 --> 00:43:35,895
We're going now?

683
00:43:35,935 --> 00:43:38,405
No, we're not supposed to be leaving
for another week.

684
00:43:38,445 --> 00:43:41,135
Get dressed and then come and have
some breakfast, dear.

685
00:43:41,175 --> 00:43:42,665
Willow will pack
your things.

686
00:43:42,715 --> 00:43:44,775
Why, I'd be happy to pack your things,
Miss Allie.

687
00:43:44,815 --> 00:43:46,115
I don't want
you to pack my things.

688
00:43:46,145 --> 00:43:48,275
I don't want you to touch my stuff.
I'm not going.

689
00:43:48,315 --> 00:43:49,785
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

690
00:43:49,815 --> 00:43:51,985
- Yes, Allie, you are.
- No, I'm not.

691
00:43:52,025 --> 00:43:54,685
Allie, you are going whether
you like it or not.

692
00:43:54,725 --> 00:43:57,455
Now, even if Aaron
has to throw you over his shoulder

693
00:43:57,495 --> 00:44:01,225
and drag you the whole way,
you're going.

694
00:44:05,505 --> 00:44:06,665
Excuse me.

695
00:44:06,705 --> 00:44:07,965
- All right, let's go.
- Come on.

696
00:44:08,005 --> 00:44:09,695
We have to have all these
done by lunch.

697
00:44:09,735 --> 00:44:10,725
Come on, get on!

698
00:44:10,775 --> 00:44:12,365
You shouldn't be standing around.
Here we go.

699
00:44:12,405 --> 00:44:13,395
Let's go.
Come on.

700
00:44:13,445 --> 00:44:15,375
Fin!

701
00:44:19,945 --> 00:44:21,075
Where's Noah?

702
00:44:21,115 --> 00:44:22,845
He's out
delivering a load.

703
00:44:22,885 --> 00:44:26,655
- What's going on?
- I'm leaving town.

704
00:44:26,685 --> 00:44:28,245
- Leaving?
- Yeah.

705
00:44:28,295 --> 00:44:30,785
- When?
- Now, right now... like today.

706
00:44:32,965 --> 00:44:34,895
Look, I need you to tell Noah
something, okay?

707
00:44:34,935 --> 00:44:36,665
I need you
to tell him that I love him.

708
00:44:36,695 --> 00:44:39,225
And tell him
that I'm sorry for everything, okay?

709
00:44:40,735 --> 00:44:43,865
Look, I was up all night
with him, Allie.

710
00:44:43,905 --> 00:44:45,435
I've never seen him
so low.

711
00:44:45,475 --> 00:44:48,675
It's over. Don't make it any harder
than it already is.

712
00:44:48,715 --> 00:44:50,575
No! No, it's not over.

713
00:44:50,615 --> 00:44:52,415
Fin, we had a fight
last night.

714
00:44:52,445 --> 00:44:55,045
No, we said some things we didn't mean,
but it's not over.

715
00:44:55,085 --> 00:44:56,485
- It is over.
- No.

716
00:44:56,515 --> 00:44:58,145
Leave it alone.
Let it go.

717
00:44:58,185 --> 00:45:00,555
I'm coming.

718
00:45:00,595 --> 00:45:02,785
Mama, I'm coming!

719
00:45:05,195 --> 00:45:08,655
- Look, he understands.
- But...

720
00:45:08,695 --> 00:45:11,065
It's hard,
but he really does.

721
00:45:11,105 --> 00:45:13,895
Summer's over
and it's time to go home.

722
00:45:13,935 --> 00:45:16,265
If he wants to talk to you,
he'll write. If not?

723
00:45:21,815 --> 00:45:23,975
Okay.

724
00:45:24,015 --> 00:45:27,315
Okay, can you just... can you just
tell him that I love him, then?

725
00:45:27,355 --> 00:45:30,375
- Can you do that?
- I'll tell him.

726
00:45:31,685 --> 00:45:33,245
Thank you.

727
00:45:35,525 --> 00:45:37,115
Bye, Fin.

728
00:46:19,165 --> 00:46:20,535
She's gone.

729
00:46:35,555 --> 00:46:38,785
Summer romances end
for all kinds of reasons.

730
00:46:39,985 --> 00:46:41,985
But when all
is said and done,

731
00:46:42,025 --> 00:46:43,855
they have
one thing in common:

732
00:46:43,895 --> 00:46:46,915
They are shooting stars...

733
00:46:46,965 --> 00:46:50,025
a spectacular moment
of light in the heavens,

734
00:46:50,065 --> 00:46:51,795
a fleeting glimpse
of eternity.

735
00:46:51,835 --> 00:46:56,065
And in a flash,
they're gone.

736
00:46:57,705 --> 00:46:59,405
Noah was desperate.

737
00:46:59,445 --> 00:47:01,605
He wrote to Allie
that he was sorry and stupid

738
00:47:01,645 --> 00:47:03,575
for breaking up
with her.

739
00:47:03,615 --> 00:47:07,375
He wrote to tell her that he still loved
her, and he wanted to see her.

740
00:47:07,415 --> 00:47:11,515
And that if she would write back,
he would come to wherever she was.

741
00:47:14,425 --> 00:47:17,255
He wrote one letter
a day for a year...

742
00:47:17,295 --> 00:47:19,725
365 letters,

743
00:47:19,765 --> 00:47:21,495
but they all
went unanswered.

744
00:47:21,535 --> 00:47:24,295
Hey Fred!
Nothing?

745
00:47:24,335 --> 00:47:25,635
Sorry.

746
00:47:25,665 --> 00:47:28,395
All right,
thank you.

747
00:47:28,435 --> 00:47:30,425
Finally, after a year
of silence,

748
00:47:30,475 --> 00:47:34,605
he decided to put it all behind him
and start a new life.

749
00:47:34,645 --> 00:47:36,575
So he wrote
a farewell letter

750
00:47:36,615 --> 00:47:39,205
And he and Fin
packed their bags

751
00:47:39,245 --> 00:47:41,075
and headed for Atlanta.

752
00:47:41,115 --> 00:47:43,015
Noah! Noah!

753
00:47:43,055 --> 00:47:44,915
Noah!

754
00:47:46,025 --> 00:47:47,815
Come on,
listen to this!

755
00:47:47,855 --> 00:47:53,625
A state of war has existed

756
00:47:53,665 --> 00:47:56,595
between
the United States and the...

757
00:47:56,635 --> 00:47:58,395
The Constitution
of the United States,

758
00:47:58,435 --> 00:48:01,765
against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

759
00:48:01,805 --> 00:48:04,835
Noah and Fin
enlisted together.

760
00:48:04,875 --> 00:48:06,865
And after two years
of chasing Rommel

761
00:48:06,905 --> 00:48:08,705
through
the North African desert,

762
00:48:08,745 --> 00:48:12,305
they were deployed
to Patton's Third Army in Europe.

763
00:48:21,795 --> 00:48:22,915
Go!

764
00:48:28,335 --> 00:48:29,795
Fin!

765
00:48:53,925 --> 00:48:55,855
Do I contradict myself?

766
00:48:55,895 --> 00:48:58,055
Very well then,
I contradict myself.

767
00:48:58,095 --> 00:49:00,285
Allie was in her
third year of college

768
00:49:00,325 --> 00:49:03,385
when she volunteered
as a nurse's aid.

769
00:49:03,435 --> 00:49:06,195
To her, the broken men
with shattered bodies,

770
00:49:06,235 --> 00:49:09,295
who filled the ward
were all Noah.

771
00:49:09,335 --> 00:49:12,365
Or someone who fought
beside him in the jungle

772
00:49:12,405 --> 00:49:15,175
or frozen
snow swept road.

773
00:49:15,215 --> 00:49:16,615
I'm gonna lift you up.

774
00:49:16,645 --> 00:49:18,175
Ready?

775
00:49:18,215 --> 00:49:21,415
There we go.

776
00:49:21,455 --> 00:49:24,855
Now, I'm gonna bring
this leg over.

777
00:49:24,885 --> 00:49:26,045
- Set it on the stool.
- All right.

778
00:49:26,085 --> 00:49:28,685
- You okay?
- Yeah.

779
00:49:28,725 --> 00:49:32,055
Miss, can I
ask you a question?

780
00:49:34,095 --> 00:49:35,925
I noticed that you
aren't wearing a ring.

781
00:49:35,965 --> 00:49:40,295
And I was wondering
if I could take you out.

782
00:49:41,805 --> 00:49:44,205
- Excuse me?
- On a date.

783
00:49:47,245 --> 00:49:50,115
Now, before you go
and say no,

784
00:49:50,145 --> 00:49:53,585
I'll have you know that
I am an excellent dancer

785
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:56,605
and my intentions
are completely dishonorable.

786
00:50:01,155 --> 00:50:04,455
Okay, okay
"Casanova," come on.

787
00:50:04,495 --> 00:50:06,585
Let's just
get you better,

788
00:50:06,625 --> 00:50:08,855
then we'll talk
about a date, okay?

789
00:50:18,605 --> 00:50:20,595
Would you get
a load of him?

790
00:50:23,375 --> 00:50:25,935
Oh my gosh,
he is dreamy.

791
00:50:26,945 --> 00:50:29,005
What is he doing here?

792
00:50:29,055 --> 00:50:30,455
He's staring at you.

793
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:31,885
Oh, miss?

794
00:50:34,155 --> 00:50:36,095
I'm all better.

795
00:50:37,195 --> 00:50:39,825
Now, how's
about that date?

796
00:50:39,865 --> 00:50:41,955
Allie was surprised
how quickly

797
00:50:41,995 --> 00:50:44,335
she fell in love
with Lon Hammond.

798
00:50:49,135 --> 00:50:50,765
He was handsome, smart,

799
00:50:50,805 --> 00:50:53,635
funny, sophisticated
and charming.

800
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:55,765
Hey!

801
00:51:02,285 --> 00:51:04,775
He also came from
old Southern money,

802
00:51:04,825 --> 00:51:06,615
and was
fabulously wealthy.

803
00:51:11,365 --> 00:51:14,765
What?

804
00:51:18,735 --> 00:51:19,725
# Hya! #

805
00:51:21,905 --> 00:51:23,425
Oh, what's happening?

806
00:51:23,475 --> 00:51:24,965
- Where you going?
- Where they going?

807
00:51:25,005 --> 00:51:27,635
- See you later, sweetheart.
- Oh dear, look at that.

808
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:32,905
Allie, I've been thinking a lot about
why we shouldn't get married.

809
00:51:32,945 --> 00:51:35,575
Okay, I give up,
why shouldn't we get married?

810
00:51:35,615 --> 00:51:38,105
Well see, that's the thing,
I couldn't think of anything at first.

811
00:51:38,155 --> 00:51:40,955
An then, it just dawned on me.
Your parents...

812
00:51:40,995 --> 00:51:42,825
- My parents?
- Absolutely.

813
00:51:42,855 --> 00:51:44,795
- Your old mom and dad.
Thank you for that.

814
00:51:44,825 --> 00:51:46,155
Mom?

815
00:51:46,195 --> 00:51:47,755
You see, the problem is
that they love me.

816
00:51:47,795 --> 00:51:49,355
- I'm exactly the type of man
- They do.

817
00:51:49,395 --> 00:51:51,125
- They want you to end up with.
- Really?

818
00:51:51,165 --> 00:51:54,725
You know, I'm wealthy,
I'm from the South, I got a decent job.

819
00:51:54,775 --> 00:51:58,065
You know, I'm an incredible dancer,
I'm a really smart guy.

820
00:51:58,105 --> 00:52:00,575
You look great.

821
00:52:00,605 --> 00:52:03,075
- I like to think...
- So what's the problem, huh?

822
00:52:03,115 --> 00:52:05,605
Now just this, if you marry me...

823
00:52:05,645 --> 00:52:07,305
Now listen close.

824
00:52:07,345 --> 00:52:09,115
If you marry me...

825
00:52:09,155 --> 00:52:12,455
Then you will have lost a life long
battle of defiance against them.

826
00:52:12,485 --> 00:52:14,185
Oh my goodness,
what are we going to do?

827
00:52:14,225 --> 00:52:15,455
I do not know.

828
00:52:15,495 --> 00:52:18,425
Hey, band,
you feeling all right?

829
00:52:18,465 --> 00:52:20,655
# Hey, band,
you feeling all right?! #

830
00:52:20,695 --> 00:52:22,665
# Ooh bop sha bam,
shi bimmy bop #

831
00:52:22,695 --> 00:52:25,135
- # Oh bop sha bam, shi bimmy bop #
- You say it!

832
00:52:25,165 --> 00:52:27,635
- # Ally ally ally ooh #
- # Ally ally ally ooh #

833
00:52:27,675 --> 00:52:29,605
- # Olly olly olly ooh #
- # Olly olly olly ooh #

834
00:52:29,635 --> 00:52:31,035
- # Whooly ooh #
- # Whooly ooh #

835
00:52:31,075 --> 00:52:33,475
- # Whooly ooh #
- # Whooly ooh #

836
00:52:35,375 --> 00:52:38,675
See Allie, I think...
damn it, I think you have to marry me.

837
00:52:38,715 --> 00:52:40,775
- I think you need to marry me.
- I do?

838
00:52:40,815 --> 00:52:42,015
- Yes you do.
- I do, why?

839
00:52:42,055 --> 00:52:44,315
Because if you do,
you parents will always know

840
00:52:44,355 --> 00:52:47,945
the unhappiness that you feel for
not being able to disappoint them.

841
00:52:47,995 --> 00:52:50,785
I think you may
have overlooked one minor detail.

842
00:52:50,825 --> 00:52:51,985
And what's that?

843
00:52:52,025 --> 00:52:54,865
Well, you see you have to
get their permission first.

844
00:52:54,895 --> 00:52:57,795
And I think you may have overestimated
their affection for you.

845
00:52:57,835 --> 00:52:59,305
Is that right?

846
00:52:59,335 --> 00:53:01,825
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, I don't think so.

847
00:53:01,875 --> 00:53:02,865
Then why not?

848
00:53:02,905 --> 00:53:05,305
Oh, 'cause I asked them
already and they said yes.

849
00:53:05,345 --> 00:53:07,135
What?

850
00:53:10,715 --> 00:53:12,345
One more thing.

851
00:53:14,015 --> 00:53:16,005
I love you.

852
00:53:16,055 --> 00:53:18,315
Will you marry me, honey?

853
00:53:18,355 --> 00:53:21,325
I know I kid around a lot,
but I'm crazy about you.

854
00:53:23,125 --> 00:53:26,215
Marry me? Make me
the happiest man in the world.

855
00:53:28,965 --> 00:53:31,055
Yes. Yes!

856
00:53:35,305 --> 00:53:38,705
- Just hold tight.
- Where are you going?

857
00:53:38,745 --> 00:53:41,605
Oh my God. Mama.

858
00:53:41,645 --> 00:53:43,505
Okay, stop the band.

859
00:53:43,545 --> 00:53:45,375
Excuse me. I'd like
everyone here to know

860
00:53:45,415 --> 00:53:47,345
that this young lady
and I are getting married.

861
00:53:55,095 --> 00:53:57,955
She agreed with all her heart,
but couldn't understand

862
00:53:57,995 --> 00:54:01,155
why at the very moment
she said yes,

863
00:54:01,195 --> 00:54:04,225
Noah's face
came to her mind.

864
00:54:14,515 --> 00:54:17,135
Hey, Noah, yeah!

865
00:54:17,175 --> 00:54:19,875
Oh, good to see you.
Let me see you.

866
00:54:19,915 --> 00:54:21,645
You bleeding anywhere?
No?

867
00:54:21,685 --> 00:54:23,155
- Everything good?
- Yeah.

868
00:54:23,185 --> 00:54:24,745
Oh, I love you.

869
00:54:24,785 --> 00:54:27,655
Come on, there's something
I got to show you.

870
00:54:27,695 --> 00:54:29,125
- Come on.
- All right.

871
00:54:33,765 --> 00:54:35,455
What's going on?

872
00:54:35,495 --> 00:54:36,755
What is this?

873
00:54:36,795 --> 00:54:38,465
Here.

874
00:54:38,505 --> 00:54:39,995
I sold the house.

875
00:54:41,435 --> 00:54:43,465
- You sold the house?
- Yup.

876
00:54:43,505 --> 00:54:45,335
Gotta be out
by the end of the month.

877
00:54:45,375 --> 00:54:48,105
Between that and your GI Bill,
you ought to be able to get it now.

878
00:54:49,315 --> 00:54:51,245
- Get what?
- Your dream house.

879
00:54:51,285 --> 00:54:52,645
- The Windsor Plantation.
- Dad...

880
00:54:52,685 --> 00:54:54,805
Now, don't Dad me,
I don't want to hear about it.

881
00:54:54,855 --> 00:54:58,415
I already talked to the bank,
they're gonna give you the loan.

882
00:54:58,455 --> 00:55:02,285
- Well, I can't let you sell your house.
- It's done.

883
00:55:02,325 --> 00:55:05,815
It's a good thing.
You should do it.

884
00:55:11,435 --> 00:55:14,425
Wait a second. You sell the house,
where are you gonna live?

885
00:55:14,475 --> 00:55:16,025
With you, dummy,
what do you think?

886
00:55:16,075 --> 00:55:18,405
Somebody's got
to help you fix it up.

887
00:55:27,145 --> 00:55:29,245
Noah took a look
at the house,

888
00:55:29,285 --> 00:55:31,775
but only saw
one thing...

889
00:55:31,825 --> 00:55:34,115
Allie.

890
00:55:34,155 --> 00:55:37,485
He decided right there
to fulfill his life-long dream.

891
00:55:37,525 --> 00:55:42,125
He would rebuild the old house
from the ground up.

892
00:55:44,065 --> 00:55:49,125
And when Noah went to Charleston
to get the building plans approved,

893
00:55:49,175 --> 00:55:53,075
fate stepped in
and dealt him a sweet card.

894
00:56:00,045 --> 00:56:02,955
Stop the bus!
Stop the bus.

895
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:05,215
Sorry, Mac, I can't stop the bus
until I get to the depot.

896
00:56:05,255 --> 00:56:07,385
No, no, no, please stop
the bus now. Please!

897
00:56:07,425 --> 00:56:08,985
Do you understand
English, pal?

898
00:56:09,025 --> 00:56:12,325
No one gets off till we get
to the depot. Now sit down.

899
00:56:12,365 --> 00:56:14,885
- God.
- Hey!

900
00:56:19,465 --> 00:56:20,995
Watch it, screwball!

901
00:56:21,035 --> 00:56:22,765
What are you doing?

902
00:56:22,805 --> 00:56:24,675
Hey!

903
00:56:24,705 --> 00:56:26,335
How old is your daughter now?

904
00:56:26,375 --> 00:56:28,635
- Well, you mind.
- He's right over there.

905
00:56:47,295 --> 00:56:49,095
Baby, hello.

906
00:56:58,775 --> 00:57:00,265
- Oh!
- Hold it.

907
00:57:05,845 --> 00:57:07,815
Oh, come with it.

908
00:57:13,885 --> 00:57:15,725
After seeing Allie that day,

909
00:57:15,755 --> 00:57:19,215
something inside
Noah snapped.

910
00:57:19,265 --> 00:57:20,855
He got the notion
into his head

911
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,455
that if he restored
the old house

912
00:57:22,495 --> 00:57:24,835
where they had
come that night,

913
00:57:24,865 --> 00:57:28,465
Allie would find a way
to come back to him.

914
00:57:28,505 --> 00:57:30,735
Some called it
a labor of love.

915
00:57:30,775 --> 00:57:33,035
Others called it
something else.

916
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:37,235
But in fact,
Noah had gone a little mad.

917
00:57:37,275 --> 00:57:38,945
- Excuse me.
- Would...

918
00:57:39,945 --> 00:57:41,605
It's time to eat.

919
00:57:41,655 --> 00:57:43,615
Lunch will be served
in the Sun Room today.

920
00:57:46,325 --> 00:57:50,155
The melon is good.
I had a bite.

921
00:57:50,195 --> 00:57:52,685
Did they ever
see each other again?

922
00:57:52,725 --> 00:57:54,995
Noah and Allie?

923
00:57:55,035 --> 00:57:57,495
Now you don't want
me to spoil the end of the story

924
00:57:57,535 --> 00:58:00,505
before I get
to the good part, do you?

925
00:58:00,535 --> 00:58:02,765
Where did I leave off?

926
00:58:02,805 --> 00:58:04,465
I shall not want.

927
00:58:04,505 --> 00:58:06,835
When Noah's father
died in November,

928
00:58:06,875 --> 00:58:08,605
the house
was all he had.

929
00:58:08,645 --> 00:58:10,875
He leadeth me down...

930
00:58:28,865 --> 00:58:31,855
In time, Noah
finished the house.

931
00:58:31,905 --> 00:58:33,895
Okay, smile.
Here we go.

932
00:58:36,075 --> 00:58:38,735
He took a good look
at what he had accomplished,

933
00:58:38,775 --> 00:58:41,745
got rip-roaring drunk
for 10 days,

934
00:58:41,775 --> 00:58:45,075
thought seriously
about setting it on fire,

935
00:58:45,115 --> 00:58:47,245
then finally
put the house up for sale.

936
00:58:47,285 --> 00:58:49,075
I'm prepared
to offer you this much.

937
00:58:51,085 --> 00:58:52,955
He had a number
of interested buyers,

938
00:58:52,985 --> 00:58:55,855
but he always found a reason
not to sell it to them.

939
00:58:55,895 --> 00:58:57,385
No.

940
00:58:57,425 --> 00:58:59,455
Either the bids
were too low,

941
00:58:59,495 --> 00:59:01,795
or if they met
his asking price,

942
00:59:01,835 --> 00:59:04,425
he felt it was worth
a lot more.

943
00:59:04,465 --> 00:59:07,235
It's a lot of money,
but I'll take it.

944
00:59:10,175 --> 00:59:12,005
$50,000.

945
00:59:12,045 --> 00:59:14,975
- That's more than my asking price.
- That's right.

946
00:59:15,015 --> 00:59:16,405
It's a great deal more.

947
00:59:21,185 --> 00:59:24,775
He told the man that offered him
$5,000 over his price

948
00:59:24,825 --> 00:59:27,785
that no one in his right mind
would do that

949
00:59:27,825 --> 00:59:30,585
and he wouldn't have
a lunatic living in his house.

950
00:59:32,825 --> 00:59:36,825
He worked out his frustration with life
on the creek every morning.

951
00:59:38,465 --> 00:59:42,165
And in the evenings,
to temper the sting of loneliness,

952
00:59:42,205 --> 00:59:44,725
there was Martha Shaw.

953
00:59:44,775 --> 00:59:46,535
Martha was a war widow

954
00:59:46,575 --> 00:59:49,235
who lived in Quail Ridge,
a town away.

955
00:59:53,485 --> 00:59:56,215
So you want to go out
tomorrow?

956
00:59:56,255 --> 00:59:57,945
I got to work.

957
00:59:57,985 --> 00:59:59,955
Well, we could
down to the river if you want to.

958
00:59:59,985 --> 01:00:01,755
Next week, sometime.

959
01:00:01,795 --> 01:00:03,455
Maybe we could
take a drive somewhere?

960
01:00:03,495 --> 01:00:05,395
No.

961
01:00:05,425 --> 01:00:07,585
Well,
I'm just asking you.

962
01:00:19,375 --> 01:00:21,535
What do you want, Noah?

963
01:00:24,445 --> 01:00:26,175
What do you mean,
what do I want?

964
01:00:28,885 --> 01:00:30,685
From me.

965
01:00:35,795 --> 01:00:38,415
Sometimes when you talk to me,
you don't even see me.

966
01:00:43,495 --> 01:00:46,025
Look, a woman knows
when a man looks into her eyes

967
01:00:46,065 --> 01:00:47,935
and sees someone else.

968
01:00:54,745 --> 01:00:57,435
Now you know I want to give you
all the things that you want,

969
01:00:59,345 --> 01:01:01,715
right?

970
01:01:04,925 --> 01:01:06,545
But I can't,

971
01:01:06,585 --> 01:01:09,455
because they're gone...

972
01:01:12,625 --> 01:01:14,255
they're broken.

973
01:01:17,335 --> 01:01:19,195
All right?

974
01:01:42,395 --> 01:01:44,015
Is the veil too much?

975
01:01:44,055 --> 01:01:46,115
Are you kidding?
You look perfect!

976
01:01:46,165 --> 01:01:49,065
You're the most
beautiful bride.

977
01:01:50,635 --> 01:01:53,195
- You look gorgeous, honey.
- Thank you.

978
01:01:53,235 --> 01:01:57,195
Wait until Lon sees you in this dress,
he's gonna go crazy.

979
01:01:57,235 --> 01:01:59,965
He won't be able
to take his eyes off you,

980
01:02:00,005 --> 01:02:01,205
or his hands.

981
01:02:01,245 --> 01:02:02,905
Oh, you're bad!

982
01:02:02,945 --> 01:02:04,535
Have you seen
this morning's paper?

983
01:02:04,575 --> 01:02:06,635
The "Daily Journal" says
that you are going to be

984
01:02:06,685 --> 01:02:09,915
- the social highlight of the season.
- Of the season?

985
01:02:09,955 --> 01:02:12,745
This is gonna be a celebration the likes
of which this town's never seen!

986
01:02:14,085 --> 01:02:15,955
She doesn't plan,
she plots, doesn't she?

987
01:02:18,295 --> 01:02:21,125
- Mama, look, the Governor's coming.
- He better. Let me see.

988
01:02:25,205 --> 01:02:26,495
Oh, boy.

989
01:02:53,595 --> 01:02:55,685
- All right Savannah, where are we at?
- We're 82 now.

990
01:03:04,475 --> 01:03:06,375
- Memphis, where are at?
- We're 89 now.

991
01:03:06,405 --> 01:03:07,535
89, great,
up from 85.

992
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:08,705
- Sir?
- Yes.

993
01:03:08,745 --> 01:03:10,175
You have a visitor.

994
01:03:11,485 --> 01:03:14,105
Well, hello.
Baby, I didn't know you were coming.

995
01:03:14,145 --> 01:03:17,315
I'm... I'm so sorry,
I should have called.

996
01:03:17,355 --> 01:03:20,375
Baby, what are you talking about?
You don't have to call.

997
01:03:20,425 --> 01:03:22,585
- Guys, could you give us a minute?
- All right.

998
01:03:22,625 --> 01:03:24,645
Yes, sir.
Miss Allie.

999
01:03:24,695 --> 01:03:25,855
Ma'am.

1000
01:03:31,735 --> 01:03:34,065
So what's up?

1001
01:03:36,235 --> 01:03:37,505
I don't paint anymore.

1002
01:03:38,875 --> 01:03:41,775
I used to paint
all the time.

1003
01:03:41,815 --> 01:03:43,145
I really loved it.

1004
01:03:43,175 --> 01:03:45,975
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

1005
01:03:48,385 --> 01:03:49,715
So paint.

1006
01:03:49,755 --> 01:03:51,715
I will.

1007
01:03:53,025 --> 01:03:56,685
- I'm gonna start.
- Great.

1008
01:04:02,665 --> 01:04:04,425
Is everything okay?

1009
01:04:07,165 --> 01:04:08,655
I need to get away.

1010
01:04:09,905 --> 01:04:11,035
Okay.

1011
01:04:11,075 --> 01:04:14,135
I need to take care
of a few things.

1012
01:04:14,175 --> 01:04:16,165
I need to clear
my head.

1013
01:04:16,215 --> 01:04:18,545
Okay,
should I be worried?

1014
01:04:18,585 --> 01:04:21,945
- No, I don't think so.
- Oh, that's reassuring.

1015
01:04:23,415 --> 01:04:25,755
Listen, are you
all right?

1016
01:04:26,755 --> 01:04:29,455
- Yeah.
- Okay, then go.

1017
01:04:29,495 --> 01:04:31,585
Take your time,
do whatever you need to do.

1018
01:04:31,625 --> 01:04:33,825
It's okay to be nervous,
all right?

1019
01:04:33,865 --> 01:04:36,055
It's normal to get
cold feet before your wedding.

1020
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:38,225
No, no second
thoughts.

1021
01:04:42,775 --> 01:04:45,005
I love you.

1022
01:04:45,045 --> 01:04:47,775
I'm going to be back from Seabrook
in a couple of days, okay?

1023
01:04:48,875 --> 01:04:52,575
- Seabrook?
- Yeah, Seabrook.

1024
01:05:38,925 --> 01:05:39,915
Hello.

1025
01:05:44,595 --> 01:05:47,535
I saw your picture
in the paper,

1026
01:05:47,565 --> 01:05:49,365
the one with you
and the house.

1027
01:05:49,405 --> 01:05:52,275
And I just wanted to come
and see if you were okay.

1028
01:05:52,305 --> 01:05:54,465
I mean, I wasn't
in the neighborhood or anything.

1029
01:05:54,505 --> 01:05:55,495
I just...

1030
01:06:03,315 --> 01:06:04,715
So are you okay?

1031
01:06:09,255 --> 01:06:11,125
Okay, good.

1032
01:06:15,565 --> 01:06:17,965
I'm a stupid woman,
I shouldn't have come.

1033
01:06:39,585 --> 01:06:41,315
You want to come in?

1034
01:06:41,355 --> 01:06:43,155
Okay.

1035
01:06:45,895 --> 01:06:47,955
This is a good story.

1036
01:06:47,995 --> 01:06:50,085
I'm glad you like it.

1037
01:06:51,465 --> 01:06:53,195
I think
I've heard it before.

1038
01:06:55,275 --> 01:06:56,325
Yes.

1039
01:06:57,605 --> 01:07:00,365
Perhaps more than once?

1040
01:07:00,405 --> 01:07:01,875
Doctor needs
to see you.

1041
01:07:01,915 --> 01:07:04,145
- Me? Now?
- No, him.

1042
01:07:04,175 --> 01:07:06,645
But he hasn't finished
reading his story.

1043
01:07:06,685 --> 01:07:09,085
I'll read some more
when I'm through with the doctor.

1044
01:07:09,115 --> 01:07:11,145
This shouldn't take
too long.

1045
01:07:11,185 --> 01:07:12,915
- All right.
- Don't you go away.

1046
01:07:12,955 --> 01:07:15,855
I'll be right back.

1047
01:07:15,895 --> 01:07:19,015
While you waiting, maybe you'd like
to play the piano for a few minutes.

1048
01:07:19,065 --> 01:07:20,045
You do like that.

1049
01:07:20,095 --> 01:07:22,255
I do?

1050
01:07:22,295 --> 01:07:25,695
- I don't know any tunes.
- You can read music.

1051
01:07:25,735 --> 01:07:28,935
No kidding?

1052
01:07:33,245 --> 01:07:34,765
Who are you?

1053
01:07:34,805 --> 01:07:38,075
I'm Dr. Barnwell,
one of the new attending physicians.

1054
01:07:38,115 --> 01:07:40,545
We haven't met,
so I thought I'd examine you myself.

1055
01:07:43,585 --> 01:07:45,485
Okay, so I see here

1056
01:07:45,525 --> 01:07:48,755
that you've had two heart attacks
over the last 18 months.

1057
01:07:48,795 --> 01:07:51,085
Yeah, minor ones,
I think one was angina.

1058
01:07:51,125 --> 01:07:54,095
- Okay, any complications?
- Nope, feel fine.

1059
01:07:54,125 --> 01:07:56,625
Okay, deep breath
for me.

1060
01:07:56,665 --> 01:07:59,655
Okay, one more time.

1061
01:08:00,835 --> 01:08:03,395
And deep breath.

1062
01:08:03,435 --> 01:08:06,805
And one more.

1063
01:08:06,845 --> 01:08:09,815
Terrific, terrific.
You still taking your medication?

1064
01:08:09,845 --> 01:08:12,745
- Every day, twice a day.
- Good, good, good, good, good.

1065
01:08:12,785 --> 01:08:15,215
Okay, you can
put your shirt on.

1066
01:08:20,355 --> 01:08:22,945
So I understand that you
read to Miss Hamilton.

1067
01:08:22,995 --> 01:08:25,555
Yeah, to help
her remember.

1068
01:08:25,595 --> 01:08:27,895
- Hmm.
- You don't think it'll help?

1069
01:08:27,925 --> 01:08:29,825
No, I don't.

1070
01:08:29,865 --> 01:08:32,335
She remembers, Doc.

1071
01:08:32,365 --> 01:08:35,635
I read to her
and she remembers.

1072
01:08:35,675 --> 01:08:38,265
Not always,
but she remembers.

1073
01:08:38,305 --> 01:08:40,435
But senile dementia
is irreversible.

1074
01:08:40,475 --> 01:08:42,205
It's degenerative.

1075
01:08:42,245 --> 01:08:45,265
After a certain point,
its victims don't come back.

1076
01:08:45,315 --> 01:08:47,175
Yeah, that's what
they keep telling me.

1077
01:08:47,215 --> 01:08:49,245
Well, I just don't want
you to get your hopes up.

1078
01:08:49,285 --> 01:08:53,115
Well, thanks, Doc,
but you know what they say?

1079
01:08:53,155 --> 01:08:56,745
Science goes only so far
and then comes God.

1080
01:08:56,795 --> 01:08:58,485
Then comes God.

1081
01:09:00,865 --> 01:09:03,955
Damn, I forgot to turn the page for her.
You through with me?

1082
01:09:23,355 --> 01:09:25,975
I guess they flipped
that page.

1083
01:09:26,025 --> 01:09:29,355
No, that she's playing
by memory.

1084
01:09:31,895 --> 01:09:34,055
His name
is Lon Hammond, Jr.

1085
01:09:34,095 --> 01:09:36,825
Hammond?
As in Hammond Cotton?

1086
01:09:36,865 --> 01:09:38,385
As in Hammond Cotton.

1087
01:09:38,435 --> 01:09:40,835
Well, your parents
must love him.

1088
01:09:40,865 --> 01:09:45,605
He's a really good man, Noah.
You'd really like him.

1089
01:09:45,645 --> 01:09:47,575
You love him?

1090
01:09:48,845 --> 01:09:52,835
Yeah, I do.
I love him very much.

1091
01:10:00,085 --> 01:10:01,715
Well, that's that.

1092
01:10:01,755 --> 01:10:05,285
You marry Lon
and we can be friends...

1093
01:10:06,995 --> 01:10:08,425
right?

1094
01:10:08,465 --> 01:10:10,225
Right.

1095
01:10:15,775 --> 01:10:17,535
Are you hungry?

1096
01:10:17,575 --> 01:10:19,665
Do you want to stay
for dinner?

1097
01:10:21,445 --> 01:10:22,605
Umm...

1098
01:10:31,885 --> 01:10:33,785
I have to warn you,
I'm a cheap drunk.

1099
01:10:33,825 --> 01:10:37,455
A couple more of these and you're gonna
be carrying me right out of here.

1100
01:10:37,495 --> 01:10:40,425
Well, you go slow then, I don't want
to have to take advantage of you.

1101
01:10:40,465 --> 01:10:42,955
You wouldn't dare.
I'm a married woman.

1102
01:10:42,995 --> 01:10:44,725
Not yet.

1103
01:10:51,405 --> 01:10:52,835
What?

1104
01:10:55,715 --> 01:10:57,405
Why are you
looking at me like that?

1105
01:11:00,545 --> 01:11:02,515
Just memories.

1106
01:11:06,855 --> 01:11:09,445
This room.

1107
01:11:12,065 --> 01:11:14,585
This...
is this where we...

1108
01:11:15,835 --> 01:11:17,735
This is the room?

1109
01:11:33,185 --> 01:11:35,675
- I'm full.
- Me too.

1110
01:11:39,325 --> 01:11:41,585
"Oh how your fingers
drowse me.

1111
01:11:41,625 --> 01:11:44,095
Your breath falls
around me like dew.

1112
01:11:44,125 --> 01:11:47,285
Your pulse lulls
the tympans of my ears.

1113
01:11:47,325 --> 01:11:49,815
I feel a merge
from head to foot.

1114
01:11:49,865 --> 01:11:51,765
Delicious enough."

1115
01:11:53,605 --> 01:11:55,465
It was real, wasn't it?

1116
01:11:56,835 --> 01:12:00,065
You and me.

1117
01:12:00,105 --> 01:12:03,605
Such a long time ago,
we were just a couple of kids.

1118
01:12:07,415 --> 01:12:10,445
But we really loved
each other, didn't we?

1119
01:12:18,665 --> 01:12:19,925
I should go.

1120
01:12:23,665 --> 01:12:25,365
Goodbye.

1121
01:12:27,265 --> 01:12:29,395
Do you think
you could back tomorrow morning?

1122
01:12:29,435 --> 01:12:31,405
There's some place
I'd like to show you.

1123
01:12:34,305 --> 01:12:35,795
Please.

1124
01:12:37,645 --> 01:12:40,305
- Okay.
- Okay.

1125
01:12:52,625 --> 01:12:54,685
She had come back into his life

1126
01:12:54,725 --> 01:12:56,725
like a sudden flame,

1127
01:12:56,765 --> 01:12:59,285
blazing and streaming
into his heart.

1128
01:13:00,305 --> 01:13:01,705
Noah stayed up
all night

1129
01:13:01,735 --> 01:13:05,265
contemplating the certain agony
he knew would be his,

1130
01:13:05,305 --> 01:13:07,865
if he were
to lose her twice.

1131
01:13:07,905 --> 01:13:11,865
Oh, I do wish I could
figure out the end of this story.

1132
01:13:11,915 --> 01:13:14,675
The children are here.

1133
01:13:14,715 --> 01:13:16,205
Children?

1134
01:13:16,255 --> 01:13:18,345
- Not yours, his.
- Oh...

1135
01:13:18,385 --> 01:13:20,375
Do you mind?

1136
01:13:20,425 --> 01:13:22,485
Why, I'd love
to meet them.

1137
01:13:22,525 --> 01:13:25,515
Come over here.

1138
01:13:25,565 --> 01:13:27,965
- Hi, Daddy.
- Sweetheart, how are you?

1139
01:13:27,995 --> 01:13:29,625
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, Maggie.

1140
01:13:29,665 --> 01:13:32,425
Hi, I'm Allie.

1141
01:13:32,465 --> 01:13:34,455
- Hi, I'm Mary Allen.
- Mary Allen.

1142
01:13:34,505 --> 01:13:36,975
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

1143
01:13:37,005 --> 01:13:38,565
- Hi.
- Hi, Maggie.

1144
01:13:38,605 --> 01:13:41,135
Maggie, how are you?

1145
01:13:41,175 --> 01:13:42,235
Hello there, honey.

1146
01:13:42,275 --> 01:13:43,335
Hi, Davanee.

1147
01:13:43,375 --> 01:13:45,865
- What a pretty name.
- Thank you.

1148
01:13:45,915 --> 01:13:49,945
- Oh...
- Oh, how cute, thank you.

1149
01:13:51,885 --> 01:13:54,185
- And who's this?
- Edmond.

1150
01:13:54,225 --> 01:13:55,745
Hi, Edmond.

1151
01:14:07,505 --> 01:14:09,765
You know, I think
I'll run on up

1152
01:14:09,805 --> 01:14:12,795
and take my afternoon
nap, all right?

1153
01:14:12,845 --> 01:14:16,075
- Come on, honey, let's go.
- There you go.

1154
01:14:16,115 --> 01:14:17,905
- All right. Good.
- Thank you.

1155
01:14:17,945 --> 01:14:19,935
I'll read some more later.

1156
01:14:19,985 --> 01:14:22,575
All right, thank you.

1157
01:14:22,615 --> 01:14:24,675
I'm so happy
to meet you all.

1158
01:14:26,425 --> 01:14:28,155
- Goodbye.
- Bye, bye.

1159
01:14:28,185 --> 01:14:29,455
- Nice to meet you.
- Goodbye.

1160
01:14:29,495 --> 01:14:30,955
Bye.

1161
01:14:32,495 --> 01:14:35,015
- She seems good today.
- She is good.

1162
01:14:36,735 --> 01:14:39,325
I don't know, there's
something about today.

1163
01:14:39,365 --> 01:14:41,665
Maybe it's a day
for a miracle.

1164
01:14:43,635 --> 01:14:47,135
Daddy, come home.

1165
01:14:47,175 --> 01:14:49,475
Mama doesn't know us.

1166
01:14:49,515 --> 01:14:52,275
She doesn't recognize you.
She'll never understand.

1167
01:14:52,315 --> 01:14:54,475
We miss you.

1168
01:14:54,515 --> 01:14:56,345
This is crazy,
you living here.

1169
01:14:56,385 --> 01:15:01,045
Yeah, you know we'll all help with Mom.
We can take shifts visiting.

1170
01:15:02,425 --> 01:15:05,295
Look, guys,

1171
01:15:05,325 --> 01:15:07,885
that's my sweetheart
in there.

1172
01:15:07,925 --> 01:15:10,695
I'm not leaving her.

1173
01:15:10,735 --> 01:15:13,595
This is my home now.

1174
01:15:13,635 --> 01:15:15,295
Your mother is my home.

1175
01:15:21,775 --> 01:15:23,205
- Hello?
- Hey, there.

1176
01:15:23,245 --> 01:15:25,905
Hi, who is this?

1177
01:15:25,945 --> 01:15:27,715
It's Lon,
who were you expecting?

1178
01:15:27,745 --> 01:15:30,745
Uh, nobody, I...

1179
01:15:30,785 --> 01:15:33,415
I just... I'm just surprised.
How... how did you find me?

1180
01:15:33,455 --> 01:15:35,355
Well, there's only one
hotel in Seabrook.

1181
01:15:35,385 --> 01:15:37,385
And when you didn't call,
I got worried.

1182
01:15:37,425 --> 01:15:40,725
Where you been?
Are you all right?

1183
01:15:40,765 --> 01:15:44,455
You know, I feel like an idiot, 'cause I
called your hotel about a hundred times.

1184
01:15:46,505 --> 01:15:48,835
I'm fine.

1185
01:15:48,875 --> 01:15:50,065
Anything you want
to tell me?

1186
01:15:50,105 --> 01:15:52,835
- No.
- No?

1187
01:15:52,875 --> 01:15:53,965
No.

1188
01:15:57,815 --> 01:15:59,045
Okay.

1189
01:16:01,715 --> 01:16:03,585
Lon, I love you.

1190
01:16:03,615 --> 01:16:06,145
Call you tomorrow?

1191
01:16:06,185 --> 01:16:07,675
Okay.

1192
01:16:37,985 --> 01:16:38,975
Noah?

1193
01:16:40,925 --> 01:16:42,185
Noah!

1194
01:16:58,105 --> 01:17:00,165
Hey, there.

1195
01:17:05,885 --> 01:17:08,315
Well, we better get going,
the rain's coming in.

1196
01:17:33,805 --> 01:17:36,365
- You like it?
- It's spectacular.

1197
01:17:41,685 --> 01:17:43,175
It's like a dream.

1198
01:17:44,415 --> 01:17:47,215
- Do you want to feed them?
- Yeah.

1199
01:18:05,235 --> 01:18:06,725
What are they all
doing here?

1200
01:18:08,475 --> 01:18:10,375
I don't know.

1201
01:18:10,415 --> 01:18:13,175
They're supposed to migrate
to the Guatemala sound.

1202
01:18:13,215 --> 01:18:14,875
They won't stay here?

1203
01:18:14,915 --> 01:18:16,815
No...

1204
01:18:18,055 --> 01:18:21,025
they'll go back
where they came from.

1205
01:18:31,895 --> 01:18:33,495
You're different.

1206
01:18:33,535 --> 01:18:36,025
What do you mean?

1207
01:18:37,675 --> 01:18:40,695
Just the way you look.
Everything.

1208
01:18:40,745 --> 01:18:43,715
You look different too,
but in a good way.

1209
01:18:49,455 --> 01:18:51,475
You know, you're kinda
the same though.

1210
01:18:53,385 --> 01:18:55,325
Yeah?

1211
01:18:55,355 --> 01:18:57,485
Yeah.

1212
01:18:59,495 --> 01:19:01,895
And you really did it.

1213
01:19:01,925 --> 01:19:04,365
- What?
- Everything.

1214
01:19:04,395 --> 01:19:06,125
The house...

1215
01:19:07,865 --> 01:19:09,895
it's beautiful
what you did.

1216
01:19:13,275 --> 01:19:15,935
Well, I promised you
I would.

1217
01:19:25,355 --> 01:19:27,515
Great.

1218
01:19:27,555 --> 01:19:29,585
We got to go.

1219
01:19:59,985 --> 01:20:02,115
Noah!

1220
01:20:54,175 --> 01:20:55,835
Why didn't you
write me?

1221
01:20:56,845 --> 01:20:58,205
Why?

1222
01:20:59,585 --> 01:21:01,705
It wasn't over for me.

1223
01:21:01,745 --> 01:21:04,415
I waited for you
for seven years.

1224
01:21:04,455 --> 01:21:06,045
And now it's too late.

1225
01:21:07,255 --> 01:21:10,015
I wrote you 365 letters.

1226
01:21:12,025 --> 01:21:13,925
I wrote you every day
for a year.

1227
01:21:13,965 --> 01:21:16,365
- You wrote me?
- Yes.

1228
01:21:16,395 --> 01:21:18,295
You...

1229
01:21:18,335 --> 01:21:20,635
It wasn't over.

1230
01:21:21,635 --> 01:21:22,765
It still isn't over.

1231
01:23:26,865 --> 01:23:29,295
Oh...

1232
01:23:33,235 --> 01:23:35,095
You got
to be kidding me.

1233
01:23:36,875 --> 01:23:39,235
All this time,
that's what I'd been missing?

1234
01:23:44,045 --> 01:23:45,905
Let's do it again.

1235
01:23:59,095 --> 01:24:01,225
Noah.

1236
01:24:21,745 --> 01:24:22,945
Noah.

1237
01:24:31,855 --> 01:24:33,825
Wake up.

1238
01:24:35,095 --> 01:24:37,355
Wake up.

1239
01:24:43,675 --> 01:24:47,105
- Hi.
- You're trying to kill me, woman.

1240
01:24:53,515 --> 01:24:55,345
I need rest.

1241
01:24:55,385 --> 01:24:59,645
I need food
so I can regain my strength.

1242
01:25:00,725 --> 01:25:03,515
Okay, what do you want?

1243
01:25:06,125 --> 01:25:09,095
Umm... umm...

1244
01:25:09,125 --> 01:25:11,095
some pancakes.

1245
01:25:11,135 --> 01:25:13,295
Okay.

1246
01:25:13,335 --> 01:25:15,425
And bacon.

1247
01:25:15,465 --> 01:25:18,405
- Okay.
- And some chicken.

1248
01:26:04,315 --> 01:26:06,785
She's the one,
isn't she?

1249
01:26:12,695 --> 01:26:14,885
Can I meet her?

1250
01:26:17,165 --> 01:26:18,355
I'd really like to meet her.

1251
01:26:18,395 --> 01:26:20,225
I don't know if that's
a good idea, Martha.

1252
01:26:23,635 --> 01:26:26,105
So this is Martha?

1253
01:26:26,145 --> 01:26:29,105
Hi, I'm Allie.

1254
01:26:29,145 --> 01:26:31,135
I've heard
a lot about you.

1255
01:26:32,345 --> 01:26:34,285
I've heard
a lot about you, too.

1256
01:26:34,315 --> 01:26:36,145
You want to come in?

1257
01:26:38,455 --> 01:26:39,885
Are you sure?

1258
01:26:39,925 --> 01:26:43,115
Yeah, yeah,
Noah's just saying how hungry he was.

1259
01:26:43,155 --> 01:26:45,595
And, you know,
you could put on a pot of tea.

1260
01:26:47,695 --> 01:26:49,125
Come on in.

1261
01:26:52,295 --> 01:26:54,135
Come on in.

1262
01:27:03,215 --> 01:27:05,045
It was nice meeting you,
Martha.

1263
01:27:05,075 --> 01:27:07,345
- Nice meeting you too.
- Goodbye.

1264
01:27:07,385 --> 01:27:08,935
Take care.

1265
01:27:27,935 --> 01:27:31,565
She's sensational.
She really is.

1266
01:27:32,875 --> 01:27:34,705
I'm really glad
that I came, Noah.

1267
01:27:40,115 --> 01:27:42,205
I'd forgotten
what it's like.

1268
01:27:46,325 --> 01:27:49,385
For the first time
since I lost Richard,

1269
01:27:49,425 --> 01:27:51,895
I feel like I've got something
to look forward to.

1270
01:30:10,195 --> 01:30:12,295
Lon is on his way here.

1271
01:30:14,635 --> 01:30:17,725
I'm afraid your father spilled
the beans about Noah,

1272
01:30:17,775 --> 01:30:19,675
and when Lon didn't hear
from you again last night,

1273
01:30:19,705 --> 01:30:20,795
he decided to come.

1274
01:30:20,845 --> 01:30:24,005
Well, that's great.
That's just terrific.

1275
01:30:24,045 --> 01:30:27,535
You, me, Noah and Lon,
one big happy family.

1276
01:30:33,185 --> 01:30:36,015
Tell me about
the letters, Mother.

1277
01:30:36,055 --> 01:30:38,325
- Is it true?
- Yes.

1278
01:30:39,325 --> 01:30:42,095
You watched me
cry myself to sleep

1279
01:30:42,125 --> 01:30:44,525
for months and months

1280
01:30:44,565 --> 01:30:47,035
and you never
said anything.

1281
01:30:47,065 --> 01:30:48,725
- How could you do that?
- I'm sorry.

1282
01:30:48,765 --> 01:30:51,165
- You're sorry? You're sorry?
- Yes, I am... I am sorry.

1283
01:30:51,205 --> 01:30:52,865
Because of you,
my entire life is ruined!

1284
01:30:52,905 --> 01:30:54,535
Okay, yes,
I stole your letters.

1285
01:30:54,575 --> 01:30:56,205
It was wrong,
but stop being dramatic

1286
01:30:56,245 --> 01:30:58,215
and at least take some
of the responsibility.

1287
01:31:00,345 --> 01:31:03,285
You came down here.
You knew what you were doing.

1288
01:31:03,315 --> 01:31:04,685
You knew this would happen.

1289
01:31:04,715 --> 01:31:06,845
Oh, so now I'm a tramp?

1290
01:31:06,885 --> 01:31:08,615
You are unbelievable.

1291
01:31:08,655 --> 01:31:10,745
Unbelievable.

1292
01:31:14,425 --> 01:31:17,025
Go on and get
some clothes on.

1293
01:31:17,065 --> 01:31:19,155
Let's take a drive.

1294
01:31:19,195 --> 01:31:21,895
Let's take a drive? Why would I want
to go anywhere with you?

1295
01:31:21,935 --> 01:31:25,565
Because I might know you
a little better than you think.

1296
01:31:25,605 --> 01:31:28,095
And I don't want
you waking up one morning

1297
01:31:28,145 --> 01:31:29,765
thinking that
if you'd known everything,

1298
01:31:29,815 --> 01:31:31,365
you might have
done something different.

1299
01:31:46,155 --> 01:31:47,885
What are we
doing here, Mama?

1300
01:31:49,795 --> 01:31:52,165
Do you see
that man, there?

1301
01:32:00,075 --> 01:32:03,005
Don't look like it now,
but 25 years ago...

1302
01:32:04,615 --> 01:32:07,605
oh my goodness,
he was really something.

1303
01:32:07,645 --> 01:32:10,275
We were out of our minds
in love, let me tell you.

1304
01:32:17,555 --> 01:32:19,885
Well, naturally,
your grandfather was furious, so...

1305
01:32:19,925 --> 01:32:22,125
we decided
to run away.

1306
01:32:25,195 --> 01:32:28,635
We didn't even make the next town
before the police picked us up.

1307
01:32:31,135 --> 01:32:33,295
But that was then.

1308
01:32:35,575 --> 01:32:38,705
You know sometimes
when I'm in the area,

1309
01:32:38,745 --> 01:32:41,335
I just stop here
and I watch him,

1310
01:32:44,185 --> 01:32:47,955
trying to picture how different my life
might have been.

1311
01:33:01,605 --> 01:33:05,235
I want you to know
that I love your father.

1312
01:33:05,275 --> 01:33:07,295
- Mama, I'm...
- No, goddamn it, this is important

1313
01:33:07,345 --> 01:33:09,635
and you need
to hear it. I do.

1314
01:33:09,675 --> 01:33:12,165
He is a wonderful man.

1315
01:33:12,215 --> 01:33:15,375
He is good to me
and I don't deserve him.

1316
01:33:15,415 --> 01:33:18,215
I love him, Allie,
I do, I love him.

1317
01:33:21,485 --> 01:33:22,925
I know.

1318
01:33:27,695 --> 01:33:30,065
Oh, God.

1319
01:33:31,465 --> 01:33:34,595
Oh, this is just
very embarrassing.

1320
01:33:34,635 --> 01:33:37,965
Oh, I'm a stupid woman.

1321
01:33:38,005 --> 01:33:40,705
Look at me,
the big old bawl-bag.

1322
01:33:43,515 --> 01:33:45,375
It's crazy.

1323
01:33:53,055 --> 01:33:56,485
I don't even know
who that person is.

1324
01:34:05,095 --> 01:34:06,625
Oh, boy.

1325
01:34:34,765 --> 01:34:36,165
Okay.

1326
01:34:46,005 --> 01:34:47,475
Allie!

1327
01:35:04,325 --> 01:35:06,015
Here.

1328
01:35:10,895 --> 01:35:13,925
I hope you make
the right choice.

1329
01:35:40,095 --> 01:35:42,495
Interesting morning?

1330
01:35:42,525 --> 01:35:43,515
Yeah.

1331
01:35:45,965 --> 01:35:47,625
Lon's here in town.

1332
01:35:50,805 --> 01:35:52,565
He's here?

1333
01:35:54,545 --> 01:35:56,775
Yeah, we saw
his car on the way,

1334
01:35:56,815 --> 01:35:58,405
at the hotel.

1335
01:36:08,585 --> 01:36:10,485
I see you
got my letters.

1336
01:36:14,065 --> 01:36:15,895
Finally.

1337
01:36:22,805 --> 01:36:24,425
What are you
going to do, Al?

1338
01:36:28,745 --> 01:36:30,835
I don't know.

1339
01:36:37,955 --> 01:36:39,975
We're back to that?

1340
01:36:41,585 --> 01:36:43,185
Are we back there?

1341
01:36:45,055 --> 01:36:47,895
What about the past couple of days?
They happened, you know?

1342
01:36:47,925 --> 01:36:50,125
I know that they happened,
and they were wonderful,

1343
01:36:50,165 --> 01:36:53,365
but they were also
very irresponsible.

1344
01:36:53,395 --> 01:36:55,365
I have a fiance
waiting for me at a hotel,

1345
01:36:55,405 --> 01:36:56,625
who's going
to be crushed

1346
01:36:56,665 --> 01:36:58,155
- when he finds out.
- So you make love to me

1347
01:36:58,205 --> 01:37:00,465
and then you go back
to your husband?

1348
01:37:00,505 --> 01:37:02,335
Was that your plan?

1349
01:37:02,375 --> 01:37:04,205
Was that a test
that I didn't pass?!

1350
01:37:04,245 --> 01:37:06,875
No, I made a promise to a man, he gave
me a ring and I gave him my word.

1351
01:37:06,915 --> 01:37:08,145
And your word is
shot to hell now,

1352
01:37:08,185 --> 01:37:09,705
- don't you think?
- I don't... I don't know.

1353
01:37:09,745 --> 01:37:11,275
I'll find out
when I talk to him.

1354
01:37:11,315 --> 01:37:13,305
This is not about
keeping your promise,

1355
01:37:13,355 --> 01:37:15,915
and it's not about
following your heart,

1356
01:37:15,955 --> 01:37:17,685
it's about security.

1357
01:37:17,725 --> 01:37:19,855
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Money!

1358
01:37:19,895 --> 01:37:21,865
- What are you ta...
- He's got a lot of money.

1359
01:37:21,895 --> 01:37:23,955
- Now I hate you, you smug bastard.
- Well, I hate you.

1360
01:37:23,995 --> 01:37:25,865
- If you leave here, I hate you.
- You wou...

1361
01:37:25,895 --> 01:37:27,425
- Hate you if you leave here.
- Have you been paying attention

1362
01:37:27,465 --> 01:37:28,555
to anything that's happening?

1363
01:37:28,605 --> 01:37:30,565
I guess not.
I think I must have misread

1364
01:37:30,605 --> 01:37:32,335
- all of those signals.
- I guess you did.

1365
01:37:34,975 --> 01:37:37,735
You're bored.
You're bored and you know it.

1366
01:37:37,775 --> 01:37:40,245
You wouldn't be here
if there wasn't something missing.

1367
01:37:40,285 --> 01:37:43,015
You arrogant
son of a bitch!

1368
01:37:44,185 --> 01:37:45,985
Would you just
stay with me?

1369
01:37:46,015 --> 01:37:47,855
Stay with you?
What for?

1370
01:37:47,885 --> 01:37:50,875
- Look at us, we're already fighting.
- Well, that's what we do.

1371
01:37:50,925 --> 01:37:52,325
We fight.

1372
01:37:52,355 --> 01:37:54,555
You tell me when I'm being
an arrogant son of a bitch

1373
01:37:54,595 --> 01:37:56,895
and I tell you when you're
being a pain in the ass.

1374
01:37:56,935 --> 01:38:00,125
Which you are
99% of the time.

1375
01:38:00,165 --> 01:38:02,495
I'm not afraid
to hurt your feelings.

1376
01:38:02,535 --> 01:38:04,435
They have like
a two second rebound rate

1377
01:38:04,475 --> 01:38:07,265
and you're back doing the next
pain-in-the-ass thing.

1378
01:38:07,305 --> 01:38:08,295
So, what?

1379
01:38:08,345 --> 01:38:10,905
So it's not gonna be easy.
It's gonna be really hard.

1380
01:38:10,945 --> 01:38:13,245
And we're gonna have to work
at this every day,

1381
01:38:13,275 --> 01:38:15,245
but I want to do that,
because I want you.

1382
01:38:15,285 --> 01:38:20,275
I want all of you,
forever, you and me, every day.

1383
01:38:20,325 --> 01:38:22,725
Will you do
something for me?

1384
01:38:22,755 --> 01:38:25,785
Please?
Will you just picture your life for me?

1385
01:38:27,265 --> 01:38:30,785
30 years from now,
40 years from now, what's it look like?

1386
01:38:30,835 --> 01:38:33,525
If it's with
that guy, go! Go!

1387
01:38:33,565 --> 01:38:36,295
I lost you once,
I think I could do it again,

1388
01:38:36,335 --> 01:38:38,275
if I thought it's
what you really wanted.

1389
01:38:38,305 --> 01:38:40,895
But don't you take
the easy way out.

1390
01:38:40,945 --> 01:38:43,135
What easy way?
There is no easy way,

1391
01:38:43,175 --> 01:38:45,505
no matter what I do,
somebody gets hurt.

1392
01:38:45,545 --> 01:38:47,775
Would you stop thinking
about what everyone wants.

1393
01:38:47,815 --> 01:38:50,475
Stop thinking
about what I want, what he wants,

1394
01:38:50,515 --> 01:38:53,545
what your parents want.
What do you want?

1395
01:38:55,025 --> 01:38:57,255
- What do you want?
- It's not that simple.

1396
01:38:57,295 --> 01:39:00,555
- What do you want?
- It's not...

1397
01:39:01,795 --> 01:39:03,765
Goddamn it,
what do you want?

1398
01:39:06,565 --> 01:39:08,465
I have to go.

1399
01:40:17,575 --> 01:40:19,835
My dearest Allie,

1400
01:40:19,875 --> 01:40:23,205
I couldn't sleep last night because
I know that it's over between us.

1401
01:40:25,115 --> 01:40:28,475
I'm not bitter anymore, because I know
that what we had was real.

1402
01:40:30,145 --> 01:40:32,045
And if in some distant
place in the future

1403
01:40:32,085 --> 01:40:34,715
we see each other
in our new lives,

1404
01:40:34,755 --> 01:40:36,385
I'll smile
at you with joy

1405
01:40:36,425 --> 01:40:40,555
and remember how
we spent a summer beneath the trees

1406
01:40:40,595 --> 01:40:44,465
learning from each other
and growing in love.

1407
01:41:01,115 --> 01:41:04,415
The best love
is the kind that awakens the soul

1408
01:41:04,455 --> 01:41:06,945
and makes us
reach for more,

1409
01:41:06,985 --> 01:41:09,285
that plants a fire
in our hearts

1410
01:41:09,325 --> 01:41:12,125
and brings peace
to our minds.

1411
01:41:12,155 --> 01:41:14,955
And that's what you've
given me.

1412
01:41:14,995 --> 01:41:17,865
That's what I'd hoped
to give to you forever.

1413
01:41:17,895 --> 01:41:21,955
I love you.
I'll be seeing you, Noah.

1414
01:41:23,265 --> 01:41:27,005
It's beautiful.
It's a beautiful story.

1415
01:41:27,045 --> 01:41:28,335
Yes, it is.

1416
01:41:28,375 --> 01:41:31,705
I don't know why,
but it makes me feel sad.

1417
01:41:34,685 --> 01:41:36,675
I know you feel
lost right now,

1418
01:41:36,715 --> 01:41:38,545
but don't worry,

1419
01:41:38,585 --> 01:41:41,075
nothing is ever lost,
nor can be lost.

1420
01:41:41,125 --> 01:41:44,925
The body sluggish,
aged, cold,

1421
01:41:44,955 --> 01:41:47,155
the embers left

1422
01:41:47,195 --> 01:41:48,885
from earlier fires.

1423
01:41:48,925 --> 01:41:50,795
Shall duly flame again.

1424
01:41:53,065 --> 01:41:54,155
Did you write that?

1425
01:41:54,205 --> 01:41:57,565
No, that was Walt Whitman.

1426
01:42:00,075 --> 01:42:01,195
I think I knew him.

1427
01:42:02,205 --> 01:42:03,605
I think you did.

1428
01:42:03,645 --> 01:42:08,635
Shall we go in?
I'm feeling a little chilly.

1429
01:42:08,685 --> 01:42:10,705
Okay.

1430
01:42:10,755 --> 01:42:12,545
Thank you.

1431
01:42:22,465 --> 01:42:24,055
Well, who did
all of this?

1432
01:42:24,095 --> 01:42:28,095
I did, with a little help
from my friends on the nursing staff.

1433
01:42:28,135 --> 01:42:30,325
Oh...

1434
01:42:43,315 --> 01:42:46,875
I've never seen
anything so beautiful.

1435
01:42:46,915 --> 01:42:48,645
Neither have I.

1436
01:42:51,595 --> 01:42:52,815
Shall we?

1437
01:43:01,465 --> 01:43:03,365
- Some grape juice?
- I'd love it.

1438
01:43:06,105 --> 01:43:09,095
Ah, so many pills.
How sick are you?

1439
01:43:09,145 --> 01:43:13,015
The sickness has become
a relative term for me.

1440
01:43:13,045 --> 01:43:17,675
I think of it now as more a general
wearing out process.

1441
01:43:19,485 --> 01:43:20,475
To you.

1442
01:43:29,665 --> 01:43:31,495
So what happened?

1443
01:43:31,535 --> 01:43:33,295
In the story,

1444
01:43:33,335 --> 01:43:35,495
which one did she choose?

1445
01:43:39,675 --> 01:43:41,035
Okay,

1446
01:43:42,975 --> 01:43:45,805
the way I see it,
I got three choices.

1447
01:43:45,845 --> 01:43:47,435
One, I can shoot him.

1448
01:43:47,485 --> 01:43:51,475
Two, I can kick
the crap out of him.

1449
01:43:51,515 --> 01:43:54,815
Or three...
I leave you.

1450
01:44:01,225 --> 01:44:03,495
Well, all that's no good.

1451
01:44:05,335 --> 01:44:07,065
You see, 'cause...

1452
01:44:08,735 --> 01:44:11,255
none of those options
get me you.

1453
01:44:14,145 --> 01:44:16,765
And in spite of everything,

1454
01:44:16,805 --> 01:44:18,275
I love you.

1455
01:44:21,115 --> 01:44:22,445
I love you too.

1456
01:44:24,385 --> 01:44:26,515
I meant what I said
when I gave you that ring.

1457
01:44:26,555 --> 01:44:27,885
I did too.

1458
01:44:27,925 --> 01:44:30,545
I did too.
It's just that when I'm...

1459
01:44:30,595 --> 01:44:32,755
when I'm with Noah
I feel like one person

1460
01:44:32,795 --> 01:44:36,095
and when I'm with you
I feel like someone totally different.

1461
01:44:38,335 --> 01:44:42,135
Look, it's normal
not to forget your first love.

1462
01:44:49,975 --> 01:44:52,465
I love you, Allie,

1463
01:44:52,515 --> 01:44:55,605
but I want you
for myself.

1464
01:44:55,645 --> 01:44:57,375
I don't want to have
to convince my fiance

1465
01:44:57,415 --> 01:44:59,905
that she should be
with me.

1466
01:44:59,955 --> 01:45:03,115
You don't have to.

1467
01:45:04,255 --> 01:45:06,555
I already know
I should be with you.

1468
01:45:09,065 --> 01:45:10,925
And they lived happily
ever after.

1469
01:45:10,965 --> 01:45:14,555
Who? Who did?

1470
01:45:22,805 --> 01:45:25,675
Oh yes,

1471
01:45:25,715 --> 01:45:27,645
of course.

1472
01:46:09,525 --> 01:46:11,385
I remember now.

1473
01:46:12,695 --> 01:46:14,665
It was us.

1474
01:46:15,825 --> 01:46:18,165
- It was us. It was us.
- Oh, my darling.

1475
01:46:18,195 --> 01:46:20,565
Oh my sweetheart.

1476
01:46:20,595 --> 01:46:23,565
I love you so much.

1477
01:46:25,605 --> 01:46:27,075
Oh, my baby.

1478
01:46:29,275 --> 01:46:31,105
Noah, Noah.

1479
01:46:31,145 --> 01:46:33,635
I love you, Angel.

1480
01:46:36,415 --> 01:46:38,545
- What happened to me?
- Nothing.

1481
01:46:38,585 --> 01:46:41,215
You just went away
for a little while.

1482
01:46:45,255 --> 01:46:49,455
- How much time do we have?
- I'm not sure.

1483
01:46:49,495 --> 01:46:51,825
Last time it was no more
than five minutes.

1484
01:46:54,505 --> 01:46:56,695
Okay.

1485
01:46:56,735 --> 01:47:00,905
Hey, I brought along
an old friend.

1486
01:47:18,025 --> 01:47:22,155
# I'll be seeing you #

1487
01:47:22,195 --> 01:47:27,295
# In all the old
familiar places #

1488
01:47:27,335 --> 01:47:32,735
# That this heart
of mine embraces #

1489
01:47:32,775 --> 01:47:35,635
# All day through #

1490
01:47:38,275 --> 01:47:41,805
# In that small cafe... #

1491
01:47:41,845 --> 01:47:45,145
- How are the children?
- Oh, they're fine.

1492
01:47:45,185 --> 01:47:47,155
Now,
they were here today...

1493
01:47:47,185 --> 01:47:49,955
Little Noah, Davanee too.

1494
01:47:49,985 --> 01:47:51,585
They're getting so big.

1495
01:47:51,625 --> 01:47:56,025
- #... carousel, the chestnut trees #
- Oh, boy.

1496
01:47:56,065 --> 01:47:58,085
- # The wishing well... #
- How fast the time goes.

1497
01:47:59,665 --> 01:48:01,655
It flies right on by.

1498
01:48:01,705 --> 01:48:03,635
Oh yes, it does.

1499
01:48:03,665 --> 01:48:09,105
# In every lovely
summer's day... #

1500
01:48:09,145 --> 01:48:11,335
Will you tell them
I love them?

1501
01:48:11,375 --> 01:48:14,675
- # That's light and gay #
- Of course I will.

1502
01:48:14,715 --> 01:48:16,475
- # I'll always #
- And that I'm sorry.

1503
01:48:16,515 --> 01:48:19,075
# Think of you that way #

1504
01:48:19,115 --> 01:48:21,105
- I'll tell them, sweetheart.
- # I'll find you #

1505
01:48:21,155 --> 01:48:24,955
# In the morning sun #

1506
01:48:24,995 --> 01:48:28,685
# And when
the night is new #

1507
01:48:29,995 --> 01:48:34,095
# I'll be looking at the moon #
# But I'll be seeing you... #

1508
01:48:34,135 --> 01:48:37,125
Remember that story you were
reading to me?

1509
01:48:37,165 --> 01:48:39,065
Why, yes.

1510
01:48:45,575 --> 01:48:48,415
Do you think that
I could be her tonight?

1511
01:48:50,185 --> 01:48:51,775
Would that be
all right?

1512
01:48:52,815 --> 01:48:54,585
You know what
we could do?

1513
01:48:54,625 --> 01:48:58,215
Maybe we could get a car
and we could go for a ride.

1514
01:48:58,255 --> 01:49:01,815
Why could get out of here
and just go someplace, you want to?

1515
01:49:01,865 --> 01:49:04,985
I don't think so.
Not tonight, darling.

1516
01:49:05,035 --> 01:49:07,765
Come on, why not?

1517
01:49:07,805 --> 01:49:09,795
Wait a minute...

1518
01:49:11,705 --> 01:49:15,235
why did you call me darling?
I don't know you.

1519
01:49:15,275 --> 01:49:18,265
What's going on here?
Am I supposed to know you?

1520
01:49:18,315 --> 01:49:21,105
- Allie... Allie, sweetheart.
- No, no, no!

1521
01:49:21,145 --> 01:49:23,705
Hey, Allie, I love you,
stay with me, don't leave...

1522
01:49:23,745 --> 01:49:26,015
No!

1523
01:49:26,055 --> 01:49:29,175
- Who are you?
- I'm Noah, I'm Noah and you're Allie.

1524
01:49:29,225 --> 01:49:31,785
What do you want?
What are you doing here?

1525
01:49:31,825 --> 01:49:34,055
- Come on, baby.
- Don't come near me!

1526
01:49:34,095 --> 01:49:35,955
- Don't you come near me!
- Allie... Allie, I...

1527
01:49:35,995 --> 01:49:37,695
Help! Help!

1528
01:49:37,735 --> 01:49:39,725
- Help me!
- Calm down, Allie, calm down.

1529
01:49:39,765 --> 01:49:40,755
No, no, not you!

1530
01:49:40,795 --> 01:49:42,425
Calm down, Allie! It's all right, sugar,
come on.

1531
01:49:42,465 --> 01:49:44,365
- No! Let me go!
- It's all right, baby. Just calm down!

1532
01:49:44,405 --> 01:49:47,775
- No! Leave me alone.
- Calm down, Allie, it's all right.

1533
01:49:47,805 --> 01:49:49,775
- Somebody help me!
- Now calm down.

1534
01:49:49,805 --> 01:49:50,905
- Help!
- Doctor!

1535
01:49:50,945 --> 01:49:52,875
Talk to me.

1536
01:49:52,915 --> 01:49:55,275
- Somebody help me!
- Calm down!

1537
01:49:55,315 --> 01:49:58,245
- Give her two cc's.
- No! No!

1538
01:49:58,285 --> 01:49:59,415
Calm down, Allie.

1539
01:49:59,455 --> 01:50:01,075
- Calm down, Allie, yes.
- One, two...

1540
01:50:01,125 --> 01:50:02,815
...three.

1541
01:50:02,855 --> 01:50:05,755
- Allie, it's all right. It's all right.
- Okay, okay, okay.

1542
01:50:05,795 --> 01:50:07,345
Okay, now take a look.

1543
01:50:07,395 --> 01:50:10,155
Let's take a look.
One... oh, she's fine.

1544
01:50:10,195 --> 01:50:12,425
- Good. Just breathe.
- She's fine. She's fine.

1545
01:50:12,465 --> 01:50:15,265
Stay calm, just breathe
in and out, come on.

1546
01:50:15,305 --> 01:50:17,535
- Relax...
- You're going to be okay, Allie.

1547
01:50:17,575 --> 01:50:18,935
- Relax.
- Allie?

1548
01:50:18,975 --> 01:50:21,565
You're fine, honey.

1549
01:50:22,845 --> 01:50:27,215
# I'll be seeing you #

1550
01:50:27,245 --> 01:50:32,615
# In every lovely
summer's day #

1551
01:50:32,655 --> 01:50:38,355
# In everything
that's light and gay #

1552
01:50:38,395 --> 01:50:42,755
# I'll always think
of you that way #

1553
01:50:42,795 --> 01:50:48,195
# I'll find you
in the morning sun #

1554
01:50:48,235 --> 01:50:51,605
# And when
the night is new... #

1555
01:50:56,145 --> 01:50:58,605
# I'll be looking
at the moon #

1556
01:51:01,985 --> 01:51:07,285
# But I'll be seeing you #

1557
01:51:07,315 --> 01:51:09,445
# I'll be seeing you #

1558
01:51:09,485 --> 01:51:13,185
# I'll be seeing you. #

1559
01:51:20,135 --> 01:51:22,155
Morning, Mr. Calhoun.

1560
01:51:23,465 --> 01:51:24,525
Mr. Calhoun?

1561
01:51:26,775 --> 01:51:29,265
Call Dr. Von Pettit
and USC, okay?

1562
01:51:29,305 --> 01:51:31,675
I've got no BP, I got no pulse.
I've got nothing.

1563
01:51:31,715 --> 01:51:34,005
Let them know we are in full arrest.
Call me on my cell.

1564
01:51:34,045 --> 01:51:36,445
Okay, will do.

1565
01:51:52,795 --> 01:51:55,695
We talked about this.

1566
01:51:55,735 --> 01:51:58,395
It's all right now.
Come on, come on, precious.

1567
01:51:58,435 --> 01:52:01,135
Okay, yes,
come on, let's go.

1568
01:52:01,175 --> 01:52:02,935
It's okay, baby,
come on.

1569
01:52:02,975 --> 01:52:05,405
You know Mr. Holmes.

1570
01:52:09,145 --> 01:52:10,975
Just try it.

1571
01:52:56,525 --> 01:52:58,225
Oh, Mr. Calhoun.

1572
01:52:59,665 --> 01:53:01,255
Welcome back.

1573
01:53:01,305 --> 01:53:05,035
- How do you feel?
- Fine. Fit as a fiddle.

1574
01:53:05,075 --> 01:53:08,505
- Where you going?
- I was just taking a walk.

1575
01:53:08,545 --> 01:53:10,905
I can't sleep.

1576
01:53:10,945 --> 01:53:13,635
Well, you know you're not supposed to,
it's against the rules.

1577
01:53:13,675 --> 01:53:16,115
Yeah, I know.

1578
01:53:16,145 --> 01:53:19,345
You weren't really
going for a walk, were you?

1579
01:53:19,385 --> 01:53:21,575
You were going
to see Miss Allie.

1580
01:53:22,885 --> 01:53:25,185
I just got out
of the hospital

1581
01:53:25,225 --> 01:53:27,055
and I miss her.

1582
01:53:27,095 --> 01:53:29,085
Mr. Calhoun,

1583
01:53:29,125 --> 01:53:31,755
I'm sorry, but I can't
let you see her tonight.

1584
01:53:31,795 --> 01:53:35,325
Now you're gonna have
to go back to your room.

1585
01:53:37,335 --> 01:53:38,535
As for me,

1586
01:53:38,575 --> 01:53:40,565
I'm gonna
go downstairs

1587
01:53:40,605 --> 01:53:43,205
and get myself
a cup of coffee.

1588
01:53:43,245 --> 01:53:46,075
I won't be back
to check on you for a while,

1589
01:53:46,115 --> 01:53:48,175
so don't
do anything foolish.

1590
01:54:44,435 --> 01:54:45,925
Hi.

1591
01:54:55,215 --> 01:54:56,205
Noah.

1592
01:54:58,515 --> 01:54:59,745
Noah.

1593
01:55:02,625 --> 01:55:05,315
Hi, sweetheart.

1594
01:55:05,355 --> 01:55:08,585
I'm sorry I haven't
been able to be here to read to you.

1595
01:55:09,895 --> 01:55:12,485
I didn't know
what to do.

1596
01:55:12,535 --> 01:55:15,155
I was afraid
you were never coming back.

1597
01:55:15,205 --> 01:55:17,165
I'll always come back.

1598
01:55:22,075 --> 01:55:25,065
What's gonna happen

1599
01:55:25,115 --> 01:55:28,205
when I can't
remember anything any more?

1600
01:55:30,185 --> 01:55:31,375
What will you do?

1601
01:55:31,415 --> 01:55:34,475
I'll be here.

1602
01:55:34,515 --> 01:55:36,745
I'll never leave you.

1603
01:55:45,965 --> 01:55:48,435
I need to ask
you something.

1604
01:55:48,465 --> 01:55:50,265
What is it,
sweetheart?

1605
01:55:54,775 --> 01:55:57,905
Do you think

1606
01:55:57,945 --> 01:55:59,935
that our love

1607
01:55:59,975 --> 01:56:02,075
can create miracles?

1608
01:56:03,615 --> 01:56:05,485
Yes, I do.

1609
01:56:06,885 --> 01:56:10,155
That's what brings
you back to me each time.

1610
01:56:18,365 --> 01:56:21,625
Do you think our love

1611
01:56:21,665 --> 01:56:23,895
could take us
away together?

1612
01:56:30,605 --> 01:56:34,305
I think our love
can do anything we want it to.

1613
01:56:47,325 --> 01:56:50,315
I love you.

1614
01:56:50,365 --> 01:56:52,385
I love you, Allie.

1615
01:57:09,215 --> 01:57:11,645
Good night.

1616
01:57:11,685 --> 01:57:13,675
Good night.

1617
01:57:18,595 --> 01:57:21,055
I'll be seeing you.

1618
01:57:22,065 --> 01:57:24,925
# La la la la #

1619
01:57:24,965 --> 01:57:26,695
# Da da da da #

1620
01:57:26,735 --> 01:57:28,855
# Dum ba da #
