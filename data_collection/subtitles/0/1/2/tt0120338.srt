1
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:53,019
13 meters. You should see it.

2
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,051
Okay, take her up and over the bow rail.

3
00:02:09,498 --> 00:02:12,699
Okay, Mir-2, we're going over the bow.
Stay with us.

4
00:02:45,581 --> 00:02:47,572
Okay, quiet. We're rolling.

5
00:02:48,216 --> 00:02:51,577
Seeing her coming out of the darkness
like a ghost ship ...

6
00:02:51,658 --> 00:02:53,572
still gets me every time.

7
00:02:54,702 --> 00:02:57,929
To see the sad ruin of the great ship,
sitting here ...

8
00:02:58,744 --> 00:03:03,098
where she landed at 2:30 in the morning
of April 15, 1912 ...

9
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:05,378
after her long fall ...

10
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:07,939
from the world above.

11
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,657
You're so full of shit, boss.

12
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,569
Dive 6.

13
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,492
Here we are again on the deck of Titanic.

14
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:45,490
2½ miles down.

15
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:48,169
3,821 meters.

16
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:53,048
The pressure outside
is 3½ tons per square inch.

17
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:55,858
These windows are 9 inches thick
and if they go ...

18
00:03:55,939 --> 00:03:58,248
it's sayonara in 2 microseconds.

19
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:01,368
All right, enough of that bullshit.

20
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:17,889
Just put her down on the roof
of the officers' quarters like yesterday.

21
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:18,967
Sure.

22
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:22,136
Okay, Mir-2, we're landing
right over the Grand Staircase.

23
00:04:22,218 --> 00:04:24,015
You guys set to launch?

24
00:04:24,218 --> 00:04:27,051
Yeah, Brock, launching Dunkin now.
Go, Charlie.

25
00:04:34,898 --> 00:04:36,934
- All right, tether out.
- Tether out.

26
00:04:37,298 --> 00:04:40,256
Okay, Brock,
we're dropping down along the hull.

27
00:04:42,818 --> 00:04:46,969
Yeah, roger that. Okay, drop down,
and go into the first-class gangway door.

28
00:04:47,057 --> 00:04:51,255
I want you guys working the "D" deck
reception area and the dining saloon.

29
00:04:51,897 --> 00:04:53,171
Copy that.

30
00:04:58,777 --> 00:04:59,892
- Tether out.
- Tether out.

31
00:04:59,977 --> 00:05:02,013
Okay, now left. Now left. Left, left.

32
00:05:10,497 --> 00:05:13,933
Snoop Dog is on the move.
We're headed down the stairwell.

33
00:05:16,977 --> 00:05:18,968
Okay, Lewis, drop down to "B" deck.

34
00:05:19,096 --> 00:05:20,245
"A" deck.

35
00:05:20,336 --> 00:05:23,010
- Give me some rope, Captain.
- "B" deck. Get in there.

36
00:06:00,495 --> 00:06:03,692
- Watch the door frame. Watch it.
- I see it. I got it.

37
00:06:10,215 --> 00:06:11,409
We're good. Just chill, boss.

38
00:06:24,654 --> 00:06:26,372
Okay, make your turn.

39
00:06:27,214 --> 00:06:29,603
- Cable out, Captain.
- Make your turn. Watch the wall.

40
00:06:29,694 --> 00:06:32,083
Brock, we're at the piano. You copy?

41
00:06:32,494 --> 00:06:33,722
Copy that.

42
00:06:41,454 --> 00:06:42,728
Right there.

43
00:06:42,814 --> 00:06:45,772
- That's it. That's the bedroom door.
- I see it.

44
00:06:55,053 --> 00:06:58,045
We're in. We're in, baby. We're there.

45
00:07:00,413 --> 00:07:03,849
That's Hockley's bed.
That's where the son of a bitch slept.

46
00:07:09,493 --> 00:07:11,768
Oops. Somebody left the water running.

47
00:07:11,853 --> 00:07:14,651
Hold it. Just a second.
Go back to the right.

48
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,968
That wardrobe door. Get closer.

49
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,730
- You're smelling something, boss.
- I want to see what's under it.

50
00:07:26,812 --> 00:07:28,609
Give me my hands, man.

51
00:07:33,612 --> 00:07:34,840
All right.

52
00:07:36,172 --> 00:07:38,845
- Take it easy. It might come apart.
- Okay.

53
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:43,402
Okay, go. Flip it over. Go. Turn over.

54
00:07:43,692 --> 00:07:45,125
Keep going. Go.

55
00:07:45,972 --> 00:07:47,451
Okay, drop it.

56
00:07:56,051 --> 00:07:58,565
Oh, baby. Are you seeing this, boss?

57
00:08:02,011 --> 00:08:03,603
It's payday, boys.

58
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,205
Cha-ching!

59
00:08:21,491 --> 00:08:23,959
- We did it, Bobby.
- We brought it back.

60
00:08:24,211 --> 00:08:25,405
Oh, yeah! You the man!

61
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:28,562
Who's the best, baby? Say it.

62
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,369
You are, Lewis.

63
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,966
- Bobby, my cigar.
- Right here.

64
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,129
Okay, crack her open.

65
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,685
Let me get around. Hang on.

66
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,044
- You getting it?
- Got it.

67
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:13,398
Shit.

68
00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:16,723
No diamond.

69
00:09:17,969 --> 00:09:20,199
You know, boss,
this same thing happened to Geraldo ...

70
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:21,847
and his career never recovered.

71
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:27,962
Turn the camera off.

72
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:31,166
Brock. The partners would like to know
how it's going.

73
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:35,039
Hey, Dave. Barry, hi.
Look, it wasn't in the safe.

74
00:09:35,128 --> 00:09:38,518
Don't worry about it. There are
still plenty of places it could be.

75
00:09:38,608 --> 00:09:39,597
Hell, yes.

76
00:09:39,688 --> 00:09:42,043
The floor debris in the suite,
the mother's room ...

77
00:09:42,128 --> 00:09:44,483
- The purser's safe on "C" deck.
- Jimmy Hoffa's briefcase.

78
00:09:44,568 --> 00:09:45,762
A dozen other places.

79
00:09:45,848 --> 00:09:49,079
Guys, look, you just got to trust
my instincts. I know we're close.

80
00:09:49,168 --> 00:09:52,399
We just got to go through
a little process of elimination.

81
00:09:53,088 --> 00:09:54,646
Hang on a second.

82
00:09:57,688 --> 00:10:00,964
- Let me see that.
- We might have something here, guys.

83
00:10:03,087 --> 00:10:06,204
- Where's the photograph of the necklace?
- We'll call you right back.

84
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:19,080
I'll be goddamned.

85
00:10:21,647 --> 00:10:24,764
Treasure hunter Brock Lovett
is best known for finding Spanish gold.

86
00:10:24,847 --> 00:10:27,315
It's okay, I'll feed you in a minute.

87
00:10:27,407 --> 00:10:31,036
He has chartered Russian subs to reach
the most famous shipwreck of all ...

88
00:10:31,127 --> 00:10:32,446
the Titanic.

89
00:10:32,527 --> 00:10:36,042
He's with us live via satellite,
from the research ship Keldysh ...

90
00:10:36,127 --> 00:10:37,401
in the North Atlantic.

91
00:10:37,487 --> 00:10:39,523
- Hello, Brock.
- Hello, Tracy.

92
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,525
Of course, everyone knows
the familiar stories of Titanic.

93
00:10:42,606 --> 00:10:45,996
You know, the nobility of the band
playing to the very end and all that.

94
00:10:46,086 --> 00:10:48,441
But what I'm interested in
are the untold stories ...

95
00:10:48,526 --> 00:10:51,040
the secrets locked deep inside
the hull of Titanic.

96
00:10:51,126 --> 00:10:54,323
And we're out here using robot technology
to go further into the wreck ...

97
00:10:54,406 --> 00:10:56,158
than anybody has ever done before.

98
00:10:56,246 --> 00:10:58,396
Your expedition is at the center
of a storm ...

99
00:10:58,486 --> 00:11:01,364
of controversy over salvage rights,
and even ethics.

100
00:11:01,446 --> 00:11:03,198
Many are calling you a grave-robber.

101
00:11:03,286 --> 00:11:06,403
Nobody ever called the recovery
of the artifacts from King Tut's tomb ...

102
00:11:06,486 --> 00:11:08,556
- What is it?
- Turn that up, dear.

103
00:11:08,646 --> 00:11:11,319
I have museum-trained experts
sent out here making sure ...

104
00:11:11,406 --> 00:11:14,238
that these relics are preserved
and catalogued properly.

105
00:11:14,325 --> 00:11:17,158
Take a look at this drawing
that we found just today.

106
00:11:17,245 --> 00:11:20,442
A piece of paper that's been underwater
for 84 years ...

107
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:23,403
and my team are able to preserve it intact.

108
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:27,959
Should this have remained unseen
at the bottom of the ocean for eternity?

109
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,478
We can see it and ...

110
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:31,157
I'll be goddamned.

111
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:37,323
Brock, there's a satellite call for you.

112
00:11:37,724 --> 00:11:40,956
Bobby, we're launching. See these
submersibles going in the water?

113
00:11:41,044 --> 00:11:43,798
Trust me, buddy,
you want to take this call.

114
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,522
This better be good.

115
00:11:47,004 --> 00:11:50,235
- You got to speak up. She's kind of old.
- Great.

116
00:11:52,564 --> 00:11:54,953
This is Brock Lovett.
How can I help you, Mrs. ...

117
00:11:55,044 --> 00:11:56,796
Calvert. Rose Calvert.

118
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:58,517
Mrs. Calvert?

119
00:11:59,404 --> 00:12:04,114
I was just wondering if you had found
the "Heart of the Ocean" yet, Mr. Lovett.

120
00:12:06,484 --> 00:12:08,839
Told you you wanted to take the call.

121
00:12:10,204 --> 00:12:12,797
All right, you have my attention, Rose.

122
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:16,075
Can you tell us who the woman
in the picture is?

123
00:12:16,163 --> 00:12:18,757
Oh, yes. The woman in the picture is me.

124
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:38,638
She's a goddamn liar!
Some nutcase seeking money or publicity.

125
00:12:39,283 --> 00:12:42,958
God only knows why!
Like that Russian babe, Anesthesia.

126
00:12:43,122 --> 00:12:44,635
They're inbound!

127
00:12:49,722 --> 00:12:53,431
Rose Dewitt Bukater died on the Titanic
when she was 17, right?

128
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:54,637
That's right.

129
00:12:54,722 --> 00:12:57,236
If she had lived, she'd be over 100 by now.

130
00:12:57,322 --> 00:12:59,438
101 next month.

131
00:12:59,642 --> 00:13:02,315
Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar.

132
00:13:02,602 --> 00:13:04,957
Look, I've already done the background
on this woman ...

133
00:13:05,042 --> 00:13:08,751
all the way back to the '20s,
when she was working as an actress.

134
00:13:08,842 --> 00:13:11,720
An actress.
There's your first clue, Sherlock.

135
00:13:11,962 --> 00:13:16,239
Her name was Rose Dawson back then.
Then she marries this guy named Calvert.

136
00:13:16,321 --> 00:13:19,758
They move to Cedar Rapids
and she punches out a couple of kids.

137
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:22,799
Now Calvert's dead, and from what I hear,
Cedar Rapids is dead.

138
00:13:22,881 --> 00:13:24,519
And everybody
who knows about the diamond ...

139
00:13:24,601 --> 00:13:27,479
is supposed to be dead or on this boat,
but she knows.

140
00:13:40,241 --> 00:13:42,835
Doesn't exactly travel light, does she?

141
00:13:42,921 --> 00:13:44,639
Hurry up, give him a hand!

142
00:13:45,001 --> 00:13:48,277
Mrs. Calvert, I'm Brock Lovett.
Welcome to the Keldysh.

143
00:13:50,201 --> 00:13:51,792
Okay, let's get her inside there.

144
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,632
- Hi, Miss Calvert.
- Hi.

145
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,518
- Welcome to the Keldysh.
- Thanks.

146
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,349
Yes?

147
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,637
- Are your staterooms all right?
- Oh, yes, very nice.

148
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,635
Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy?
She takes care of me.

149
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,757
We met just a few minutes ago.
Remember, Nana, up on deck?

150
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,915
Oh, yeah ...

151
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:26,152
There. That's nice.
Have to have my pictures when I travel.

152
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,996
Can I get you anything?
Is there anything you'd like?

153
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:31,354
Yes.

154
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,034
I would like to see my drawing.

155
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:51,757
Louis XVI wore a fabulous stone
called the Blue Diamond of the Crown.

156
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,228
It disappeared in 1792.

157
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:58,792
About the same time old Louis
lost everything from the neck up.

158
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:02,468
The theory goes that the 
crown diamond was chopped, too.

159
00:15:02,638 --> 00:15:06,950
Re-cut into a heart-like shape that 
became known as the "Heart of the Ocean".

160
00:15:07,118 --> 00:15:10,030
Today, it would be worth
more than the Hope Diamond.

161
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:14,316
It was a dreadful, heavy thing.
I only wore it this once.

162
00:15:14,478 --> 00:15:16,946
You actually think this is you, Nana?

163
00:15:17,078 --> 00:15:18,557
It is me, dear.

164
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:20,876
Wasn't I a dish?

165
00:15:22,758 --> 00:15:25,396
I tracked it down
through insurance records.

166
00:15:25,477 --> 00:15:29,152
An old claim that was settled
under terms of absolute secrecy.

167
00:15:30,157 --> 00:15:32,876
Can you tell me
who the claimant was, Rose?

168
00:15:33,157 --> 00:15:35,751
I should imagine someone named Hockley.

169
00:15:36,077 --> 00:15:39,308
Nathan Hockley. That's right.
Pittsburgh steel tycoon.

170
00:15:40,117 --> 00:15:44,668
The claim was for a diamond necklace
his son, Caledon, bought his fiancée, you.

171
00:15:45,517 --> 00:15:47,906
A week before he sailed on Titanic.

172
00:15:48,757 --> 00:15:51,271
It was filed right after the sinking.

173
00:15:51,797 --> 00:15:54,947
So the diamond had to have gone down
with the ship.

174
00:15:56,197 --> 00:15:57,596
You see the date?

175
00:15:59,036 --> 00:16:00,594
April 14, 1912.

176
00:16:00,756 --> 00:16:03,475
Which means if your grandmother
is who she says she is ...

177
00:16:03,556 --> 00:16:06,753
she was wearing the diamond
the day the Titanic sank.

178
00:16:06,836 --> 00:16:09,396
And that makes you my new best friend.

179
00:16:10,516 --> 00:16:13,826
These are some of the things
we recovered from your stateroom.

180
00:16:16,036 --> 00:16:17,435
This was mine.

181
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,474
How extraordinary!

182
00:16:21,516 --> 00:16:24,872
And it looks the same as it did
the last time I saw it.

183
00:16:30,316 --> 00:16:32,545
The reflection has changed a bit.

184
00:16:48,715 --> 00:16:51,104
Are you ready to go back to Titanic?

185
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:57,824
Here we go.
She hits the 'berg on the starboard side.

186
00:16:58,355 --> 00:17:02,950
She kind of bumps along, punching holes
like Morse code along the side ...

187
00:17:03,034 --> 00:17:04,547
below the water line.

188
00:17:04,634 --> 00:17:06,704
Then the forward compartments
start to flood.

189
00:17:06,794 --> 00:17:10,628
Now, as the water level rises,
it spills over the watertight bulkheads ...

190
00:17:10,714 --> 00:17:13,751
which, unfortunately,
don't go any higher than "E" deck.

191
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:17,986
So now, as the bow goes down,
the stern rises up, slow at first ...

192
00:17:18,074 --> 00:17:22,465
then faster and faster, until finally,
she's got her whole ass sticking in the air.

193
00:17:22,554 --> 00:17:25,944
And that's a big ass.
We're talking 20,000, 30,000 tons.

194
00:17:26,314 --> 00:17:28,874
Okay? And the hull's not designed to deal
with that pressure.

195
00:17:28,954 --> 00:17:32,469
So what happens?
She splits, right down to the keel ...

196
00:17:32,873 --> 00:17:35,069
and the stern falls back level.

197
00:17:35,714 --> 00:17:40,389
Then as the bow sinks, it pulls the stern
vertical and then finally detaches.

198
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:45,665
Now the stern section kind of bobs there
like a cork for a couple of minutes ...

199
00:17:45,753 --> 00:17:48,347
floods, and finally goes under
about 2:20 am ...

200
00:17:48,433 --> 00:17:51,231
2 hours and 40 minutes
after the collision.

201
00:17:52,073 --> 00:17:55,952
The bow section planes away,
landing about a ½ a mile away ...

202
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,945
going 20, 30 knots
when it hits the ocean floor.

203
00:18:02,392 --> 00:18:03,745
Pretty cool, huh?

204
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:07,620
Thank you for that fine 
forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.

205
00:18:09,112 --> 00:18:11,421
Of course, 
the experience of it was —

206
00:18:12,672 --> 00:18:14,503
somewhat different.

207
00:18:15,232 --> 00:18:17,143
Will you share it with us?

208
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,661
- I'm taking her to rest.
- No.

209
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,667
- Come on, Nana.
- No!

210
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,501
Give me the tape recorder.

211
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,183
Tell us, Rose.

212
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,828
It's been 84 years.

213
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:31,740
It's okay. Just try to remember 
anything, anything at all.

214
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:35,388
Do you want to hear this 
or not, Mr. Lovett?

215
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:42,068
It's been 84 years ...

216
00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:46,337
and I can still smell the fresh paint.

217
00:19:48,509 --> 00:19:50,625
The china had never been used.

218
00:19:51,749 --> 00:19:54,138
The sheets had never been slept in.

219
00:19:56,309 --> 00:19:59,665
Titanic was called "The Ship of Dreams".

220
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:02,423
And it was.

221
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:04,902
It really was.

222
00:20:33,628 --> 00:20:37,780
All third-class passengers
with a forward berth ...

223
00:20:37,868 --> 00:20:40,666
this way, please! 
This queue! Right here ...

224
00:20:40,748 --> 00:20:43,740
- It's a big boat, huh?
- Daddy, it's a ship.

225
00:20:43,828 --> 00:20:45,226
You're right.

226
00:21:13,507 --> 00:21:16,101
I don't see what all the fuss is about.

227
00:21:16,346 --> 00:21:18,702
It doesn't look any bigger
than the Mauretania.

228
00:21:18,786 --> 00:21:22,017
You can be blasé about some things, 
Rose, but not about Titanic.

229
00:21:22,106 --> 00:21:26,065
It's over 100 feet longer than 
Mauretania, and far more luxurious.

230
00:21:26,186 --> 00:21:29,337
Your daughter is far too difficult
to impress, Ruth.

231
00:21:29,506 --> 00:21:31,701
So this is the ship 
they say is unsinkable.

232
00:21:31,786 --> 00:21:34,300
It is unsinkable.
God himself could not sink this ship.

233
00:21:34,386 --> 00:21:37,105
Sir, you have to check your baggage
through the main terminal.

234
00:21:37,186 --> 00:21:38,221
It's round that way, sir.

235
00:21:38,306 --> 00:21:40,661
I put my faith in you, good sir.
Now, kindly see my man.

236
00:21:40,746 --> 00:21:43,419
Yes, sir. It's my pleasure, sir.
If I can do anything at all ...

237
00:21:43,506 --> 00:21:44,780
Yes, right.

238
00:21:44,866 --> 00:21:48,619
All the trunks from that car there.
12 from here.

239
00:21:49,386 --> 00:21:53,901
And the safe, to the parlor suite,
rooms B-52, 54, 56.

240
00:21:55,865 --> 00:21:59,221
Ladies, we better hurry. Come along.

241
00:22:03,785 --> 00:22:05,696
- My coat?
- I have it, miss.

242
00:22:05,785 --> 00:22:08,174
Queue here for health inspection.

243
00:22:08,345 --> 00:22:11,894
All third-class passengers
queue here for health inspection.

244
00:22:12,545 --> 00:22:13,739
Chin up.

245
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:21,217
- Welcome aboard, ma'am.
- Welcome to Titanic.

246
00:22:22,064 --> 00:22:25,613
It was the ship of dreams
to everyone else.

247
00:22:26,264 --> 00:22:28,380
To me, it was a slave ship ...

248
00:22:28,944 --> 00:22:31,663
taking me back to America in chains.

249
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:36,743
Outwardly, I was everything
a well brought up girl should be.

250
00:22:37,104 --> 00:22:39,174
Inside, I was screaming.

251
00:22:55,344 --> 00:22:58,301
Jack, you are pazzo.
You bet everything we have.

252
00:22:59,303 --> 00:23:02,181
When you got nothing,
you got nothing to lose.

253
00:23:08,903 --> 00:23:10,018
Sven?

254
00:23:10,903 --> 00:23:11,892
Bet.

255
00:23:30,462 --> 00:23:31,451
All right.

256
00:23:31,542 --> 00:23:34,739
Moment of truth.
Somebody's life is about to change.

257
00:23:35,862 --> 00:23:36,977
Brizio?

258
00:23:39,062 --> 00:23:40,461
- Niente.
- Niente.

259
00:23:41,822 --> 00:23:42,891
Olaf?

260
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:44,971
Nothing.

261
00:23:45,222 --> 00:23:46,257
Sven?

262
00:23:50,582 --> 00:23:51,810
2 pair.

263
00:23:52,382 --> 00:23:53,940
I'm sorry, Fabrizio.

264
00:23:54,021 --> 00:23:55,932
Che sorry, ma vaffanculo!
Did you bet all our money?

265
00:23:56,021 --> 00:23:59,900
I'm sorry, you're not going to
see your mom again for a long time.

266
00:24:00,341 --> 00:24:03,219
'Cause we're going to America.
Full house, boys.

267
00:24:16,661 --> 00:24:17,776
Come on.

268
00:24:18,861 --> 00:24:20,340
I'm going home!

269
00:24:22,981 --> 00:24:25,541
- I'm going home.
- I go to America!

270
00:24:26,181 --> 00:24:27,374
No, mate.

271
00:24:27,621 --> 00:24:31,056
Titanic go to America, in 5 minutes.

272
00:24:31,861 --> 00:24:34,328
Shit, Fabri. Come on. Come on, here.

273
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:39,978
We're riding in high style now.
We're a couple of regular swells.

274
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:43,052
We're practically goddamn royalty,
ragazzo mio.

275
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,176
You see? Is my destino.

276
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:48,491
Like I told you,
I go to America to be millionaire.

277
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:54,417
- You are pazzo.
- Maybe, but I've got the tickets.

278
00:24:56,179 --> 00:24:58,488
- I thought you were fast.
- Aspetta!

279
00:24:58,619 --> 00:25:01,293
Wait! Hey, wait!

280
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,371
We're passengers! Passengers!

281
00:25:05,459 --> 00:25:07,211
Have you been through
the inspection queue?

282
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:08,334
Of course.

283
00:25:08,419 --> 00:25:11,570
Anyway, we don't have any lice.
We're Americans, both of us.

284
00:25:11,819 --> 00:25:13,457
Right. Come aboard.

285
00:25:16,979 --> 00:25:20,289
We're the luckiest sons of bitches
in the world. You know that?

286
00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:30,293
Goodbye!

287
00:25:33,739 --> 00:25:36,536
- You know somebody?
- Of course not. That's not the point.

288
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,973
- Goodbye. I'll miss you.
- Goodbye!

289
00:25:39,058 --> 00:25:41,618
- Goodbye.
- I will never forget you!

290
00:26:27,537 --> 00:26:29,255
Come with me, darling. Let's go.

291
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,570
G-60.

292
00:26:36,056 --> 00:26:37,614
Excuse me, ma'am.

293
00:26:40,936 --> 00:26:42,255
Right here.

294
00:26:42,456 --> 00:26:45,607
How you doing? Jack. 
Nice to meet you.

295
00:26:46,096 --> 00:26:48,769
Jack Dawson. Nice to meet you.
How you doing?

296
00:26:49,616 --> 00:26:51,766
Who says you get top bunk?

297
00:26:57,136 --> 00:26:59,525
This is your private 
promenade deck, sir.

298
00:26:59,616 --> 00:27:02,335
Would you be requiring anything?
Excuse me.

299
00:27:03,256 --> 00:27:04,689
- This one?
- No.

300
00:27:04,976 --> 00:27:06,967
It had a lot of faces on it.

301
00:27:07,975 --> 00:27:09,488
This is the one.

302
00:27:10,816 --> 00:27:12,851
Would you like all of them out, miss?

303
00:27:12,935 --> 00:27:15,608
Yes, we need a little color in this room.

304
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:21,127
Put it in there. In the wardrobe.

305
00:27:21,775 --> 00:27:24,005
God, not those finger-paintings again.

306
00:27:24,095 --> 00:27:25,892
They certainly were a waste of money.

307
00:27:25,975 --> 00:27:29,251
The difference between Cal's taste
in art and mine is that I have some.

308
00:27:29,335 --> 00:27:31,007
They're fascinating ...

309
00:27:31,135 --> 00:27:33,444
like being inside a dream or something.

310
00:27:33,655 --> 00:27:35,134
There's truth, but no logic.

311
00:27:35,215 --> 00:27:38,206
- What's the artist's name?
- Something Picasso.

312
00:27:38,294 --> 00:27:42,287
Something Picasso. He won't amount
to a thing. He won't, trust me.

313
00:27:42,374 --> 00:27:45,127
- Put the Degas in the bedroom.
- At least they were cheap.

314
00:27:45,774 --> 00:27:47,685
Put it in the wardrobe.

315
00:27:52,334 --> 00:27:56,486
At Cherbourg, a woman came aboard
named Margaret Brown.

316
00:27:56,814 --> 00:27:58,691
We all called her Molly.

317
00:27:58,894 --> 00:28:01,931
History would call her
the "Unsinkable Molly Brown".

318
00:28:02,054 --> 00:28:04,614
I wasn't about to wait 
all day for you, sonny.

319
00:28:04,694 --> 00:28:06,889
Here, if you think you can manage.

320
00:28:06,974 --> 00:28:09,965
Her husband had struck gold,
someplace out west.

321
00:28:10,053 --> 00:28:13,012
And she was what mother called
"New Money. "

322
00:28:14,253 --> 00:28:17,051
By the next afternoon,
we were steaming west ...

323
00:28:17,133 --> 00:28:19,124
from the coast of Ireland ...

324
00:28:19,213 --> 00:28:21,966
with nothing out ahead of us but ocean.

325
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:32,291
Take her to sea, Mr. Murdoch.
Let's stretch her legs.

326
00:28:32,653 --> 00:28:33,881
Yes, sir.

327
00:28:36,013 --> 00:28:38,732
- All ahead full, Mr. Moody.
- Very good, sir.

328
00:28:43,612 --> 00:28:45,092
All ahead full.

329
00:28:45,492 --> 00:28:47,244
All ahead full!

330
00:28:47,652 --> 00:28:49,449
Come on, lads, step lively.

331
00:28:55,852 --> 00:28:57,524
What's the reading?

332
00:29:06,732 --> 00:29:10,202
All right! Let's stoke her right up!
We go full ahead!

333
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:12,168
Come on, right back to work.

334
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:06,568
21 knots, sir.

335
00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:16,727
Hey, look!

336
00:30:19,209 --> 00:30:20,483
See it?

337
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:26,039
There's another one. See him?

338
00:30:35,649 --> 00:30:38,038
Look at that one! Look at him jump!

339
00:31:02,288 --> 00:31:04,927
I can see the Statue of Liberty already.

340
00:31:05,288 --> 00:31:07,006
Very small, of course.

341
00:31:10,248 --> 00:31:12,808
I'm the king of the world!

342
00:31:57,166 --> 00:32:01,318
She's the largest moving object ever made
by the hand of man in all history.

343
00:32:02,526 --> 00:32:06,758
And our master shipbuilder, Mr. Andrews,
here, designed her from the keel plates up.

344
00:32:06,846 --> 00:32:10,555
I may have knocked her together,
but the idea was Mr. Ismay's.

345
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:13,804
He envisioned a steamer
so grand in scale ...

346
00:32:13,926 --> 00:32:17,839
and so luxurious in its appointments that
its supremacy would never be challenged.

347
00:32:17,926 --> 00:32:21,521
And here she is, 
willed into solid reality.

348
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,924
Hear, hear.

349
00:32:23,806 --> 00:32:25,478
The salmon.

350
00:32:28,325 --> 00:32:30,555
You know I don't like that, Rose.

351
00:32:34,005 --> 00:32:35,279
She knows.

352
00:32:37,925 --> 00:32:41,474
We'll both have the lamb.
Rare, with very little mint sauce.

353
00:32:42,685 --> 00:32:44,437
You like lamb, right, sweet pea?

354
00:32:44,525 --> 00:32:45,514
Sausage.

355
00:32:46,845 --> 00:32:49,279
You gonna cut her meat for her,
too, there, Cal?

356
00:32:51,245 --> 00:32:53,884
Hey, who thought of the name Titanic?

357
00:32:54,725 --> 00:32:57,034
- Was it you, Bruce?
- Yes, actually.

358
00:32:57,805 --> 00:33:00,159
I wanted to convey sheer size.

359
00:33:00,364 --> 00:33:02,958
And size means stability, luxury ...

360
00:33:03,404 --> 00:33:05,235
and above all, strength.

361
00:33:06,244 --> 00:33:08,553
Do you know of Dr. Freud, Mr. Ismay?

362
00:33:08,804 --> 00:33:10,999
His ideas about
the male preoccupation with size ...

363
00:33:11,084 --> 00:33:13,439
might be of particular interest to you.

364
00:33:14,084 --> 00:33:15,881
What's gotten into you?

365
00:33:15,964 --> 00:33:17,158
Excuse me.

366
00:33:21,484 --> 00:33:22,917
I do apologize.

367
00:33:23,004 --> 00:33:25,837
She's a pistol, Cal.
Hope you can handle her.

368
00:33:25,964 --> 00:33:28,353
I may have to start minding
what she reads from now on ...

369
00:33:28,444 --> 00:33:29,797
won't I, Mrs. Brown?

370
00:33:29,964 --> 00:33:32,352
Freud, who is he? Is he a passenger?

371
00:33:44,203 --> 00:33:46,239
The ship is nice?

372
00:33:46,323 --> 00:33:47,881
Yeah, it's an Irish ship.

373
00:33:47,963 --> 00:33:49,282
Is English, no?

374
00:33:49,363 --> 00:33:52,002
No, it was built in Ireland.
15,000 Irishmen built this ship.

375
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:54,472
Solid as a rock. Big Irish hands.

376
00:33:55,123 --> 00:33:56,602
Well, that's typical.

377
00:33:56,683 --> 00:33:59,436
First-class dogs come down here
to take a shit.

378
00:33:59,522 --> 00:34:02,196
Lets us know where we rank
in the scheme of things.

379
00:34:02,283 --> 00:34:04,000
Like we could forget.

380
00:34:05,282 --> 00:34:06,601
I'm Tommy Ryan.

381
00:34:06,682 --> 00:34:08,081
- Jack Dawson.
- Hello.

382
00:34:08,162 --> 00:34:09,641
- Fabrizio.
- Hi.

383
00:34:10,562 --> 00:34:13,076
Do you make any money
with your drawings?

384
00:34:22,042 --> 00:34:23,555
Forget it, boyo.

385
00:34:24,322 --> 00:34:26,313
You'd as like have angels
fly out of your arse ...

386
00:34:26,402 --> 00:34:28,631
as get next to the likes of her.

387
00:34:50,761 --> 00:34:54,151
I saw my whole life
as if I'd already lived it.

388
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,952
An endless parade of parties
and cotillions ...

389
00:34:58,441 --> 00:35:00,352
yachts and polo matches.

390
00:35:00,961 --> 00:35:05,000
Always the same narrow people,
the same mindless chatter.

391
00:35:06,161 --> 00:35:09,152
I felt like I was standing at
a great precipice ...

392
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,230
with no one to pull me back.

393
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,198
No one who cared ...

394
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,153
or even noticed.

395
00:37:02,877 --> 00:37:04,196
Don't do it.

396
00:37:04,677 --> 00:37:05,951
Stay back.

397
00:37:06,917 --> 00:37:08,669
Don't come any closer.

398
00:37:09,517 --> 00:37:12,030
Come on. Just give me your hand,
I'll pull you back over.

399
00:37:12,117 --> 00:37:13,947
No! Stay where you are.

400
00:37:14,476 --> 00:37:15,796
I mean it.

401
00:37:16,356 --> 00:37:17,675
I'll let go.

402
00:37:28,476 --> 00:37:29,909
No, you won't.

403
00:37:31,196 --> 00:37:33,152
What do you mean, no I won't?

404
00:37:33,316 --> 00:37:37,150
Don't presume to tell me what I will
and will not do. You don't know me.

405
00:37:37,236 --> 00:37:39,704
Well, you would have done it already.

406
00:37:39,956 --> 00:37:42,150
You're distracting me. Go away.

407
00:37:42,316 --> 00:37:44,307
I can't. I'm involved now.

408
00:37:45,756 --> 00:37:48,508
You let go, and I'm gonna have 
to jump in there after you.

409
00:37:50,555 --> 00:37:52,034
Don't be absurd.

410
00:37:52,475 --> 00:37:54,943
- You'll be killed.
- I'm a good swimmer.

411
00:37:55,035 --> 00:37:56,866
The fall alone will kill you.

412
00:37:56,955 --> 00:37:59,594
It would hurt. 
I'm not saying it wouldn't.

413
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,186
To tell you the truth,
I'm a lot more concerned ...

414
00:38:02,275 --> 00:38:04,345
about that water being so cold.

415
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:12,749
How cold?

416
00:38:12,835 --> 00:38:15,713
Freezing. 
Maybe a couple of degrees over.

417
00:38:20,594 --> 00:38:23,062
You ever ... 
You ever been to Wisconsin?

418
00:38:26,674 --> 00:38:27,709
What?

419
00:38:27,874 --> 00:38:30,547
They have some of the coldest
winters around.

420
00:38:30,634 --> 00:38:32,989
I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls.

421
00:38:33,154 --> 00:38:36,191
I remember, when I was a kid,
me and my father ...

422
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,782
we went ice fishing 
out on Lake Wissota.

423
00:38:39,314 --> 00:38:42,989
- Ice fishing is, you know, where you —
- I know what ice fishing is.

424
00:38:43,714 --> 00:38:44,863
Sorry.

425
00:38:46,274 --> 00:38:49,471
You just seem like,
you know, kind of an indoor girl.

426
00:38:51,394 --> 00:38:52,621
Anyway, I ...

427
00:38:53,633 --> 00:38:55,703
I fell through some thin ice.

428
00:38:55,793 --> 00:38:57,385
And I'm telling you ...

429
00:38:58,593 --> 00:39:00,185
water that cold ...

430
00:39:00,513 --> 00:39:02,344
like right down there ...

431
00:39:02,913 --> 00:39:06,792
it hits you like a 1,000 knives
stabbing you all over your body.

432
00:39:07,393 --> 00:39:10,191
You can't breathe. You can't think.

433
00:39:11,633 --> 00:39:14,227
Least, not about anything but the pain.

434
00:39:16,913 --> 00:39:20,542
Which is why I'm not looking forward
to jumping in there after you.

435
00:39:21,273 --> 00:39:22,706
Like I said ...

436
00:39:23,592 --> 00:39:25,389
I don't have a choice.

437
00:39:28,952 --> 00:39:32,024
I guess I'm kind of hoping you'll 
come back over the rail an ...

438
00:39:32,112 --> 00:39:33,909
and get me off the hook here.

439
00:39:34,232 --> 00:39:35,665
You're crazy.

440
00:39:36,912 --> 00:39:38,903
That's what everybody says bu ...

441
00:39:40,352 --> 00:39:42,183
but with all due respect, miss ...

442
00:39:42,272 --> 00:39:45,150
I'm not the one hanging off
the back of a ship here.

443
00:39:45,672 --> 00:39:46,866
Come on.

444
00:39:47,592 --> 00:39:49,184
Give me your hand.

445
00:39:49,632 --> 00:39:51,623
You don't want to do this.

446
00:40:06,631 --> 00:40:08,189
I'm Jack Dawson.

447
00:40:09,631 --> 00:40:11,508
Rose Dewitt Bukater.

448
00:40:11,591 --> 00:40:14,424
I'll have to get you 
to write that one down.

449
00:40:15,551 --> 00:40:16,745
Come on.

450
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,623
I got you. Come on.

451
00:40:24,431 --> 00:40:25,624
Come on!

452
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,429
Help, please!

453
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:37,307
- Please, help me!
- Listen to me. I've got you.

454
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:39,069
I won't let go.

455
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:41,266
Now pull yourself up. Come on!

456
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,787
Come on. That's right.

457
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:47,863
You can do it.

458
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:53,509
I got you.

459
00:40:58,909 --> 00:41:00,467
What's all this?

460
00:41:05,869 --> 00:41:08,463
You stand back! 
And don't move an inch!

461
00:41:10,789 --> 00:41:12,268
Fetch the master-at-arms.

462
00:41:14,269 --> 00:41:16,499
This is completely unacceptable.

463
00:41:16,789 --> 00:41:20,304
What made you think you could
put your hands on my fiancée?

464
00:41:20,669 --> 00:41:22,261
Look at me, you filth!

465
00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:24,385
- Cal.
- What do you think you were doing?

466
00:41:24,469 --> 00:41:26,584
Cal, stop. It was an accident.

467
00:41:27,708 --> 00:41:29,061
An accident?

468
00:41:29,708 --> 00:41:30,858
It was.

469
00:41:32,028 --> 00:41:33,427
Stupid, really.

470
00:41:33,508 --> 00:41:35,783
I was leaning over and I slipped.

471
00:41:38,308 --> 00:41:40,822
I was leaning far over to see the ...

472
00:41:45,468 --> 00:41:47,584
- Propellers?
- Propellers, and I slipped.

473
00:41:47,668 --> 00:41:51,343
And I would have gone overboard,
but Mr. Dawson here saved me.

474
00:41:51,588 --> 00:41:53,738
And almost went over himself.

475
00:41:54,228 --> 00:41:56,025
She wanted to see the propellers.

476
00:41:56,108 --> 00:41:58,906
Like I said,
women and machinery do not mix.

477
00:41:59,788 --> 00:42:01,619
Was that the way of it?

478
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,303
Yeah, that was pretty much it.

479
00:42:06,387 --> 00:42:09,299
Well, the boy's a hero, then.
Good for you, son. Well done.

480
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:12,425
So, it's all's well and 
back to our brandy, eh?
- Aha.

481
00:42:13,707 --> 00:42:17,097
Look at you. You must be freezing.
Let's get you inside.

482
00:42:18,147 --> 00:42:20,741
Err ... perhaps a little 
something for the boy?

483
00:42:22,547 --> 00:42:23,821
Of course.

484
00:42:24,267 --> 00:42:25,620
Mr. Lovejoy ...

485
00:42:25,707 --> 00:42:27,857
I think a 20 should do it.

486
00:42:28,187 --> 00:42:31,384
Is that the going rate
for saving the woman you love?

487
00:42:32,147 --> 00:42:33,819
Rose is displeased.

488
00:42:34,507 --> 00:42:35,825
What to do?

489
00:42:36,506 --> 00:42:37,621
I know.

490
00:42:39,706 --> 00:42:42,982
Perhaps you could join us
for dinner tomorrow evening.

491
00:42:43,666 --> 00:42:46,897
To regale our group 
with your heroic tale.

492
00:42:49,626 --> 00:42:51,298
Sure. Count me in.

493
00:42:51,866 --> 00:42:53,697
Good. It's settled then.

494
00:42:55,066 --> 00:42:57,102
This should be interesting.

495
00:43:05,186 --> 00:43:07,335
Can I bum a smoke?

496
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:18,341
You'll want to tie those.

497
00:43:20,105 --> 00:43:23,142
It's interesting.
The young lady slipped so suddenly ...

498
00:43:23,265 --> 00:43:26,735
and you still had time to remove
your jacket and your shoes.

499
00:43:41,984 --> 00:43:44,134
I know you've been melancholy.

500
00:43:45,224 --> 00:43:47,215
I don't pretend to know why.

501
00:43:49,624 --> 00:43:51,535
I intended to save this ...

502
00:43:51,704 --> 00:43:56,300
until the engagement gala next week.

503
00:43:57,784 --> 00:44:01,936
But I thought, tonight.

504
00:44:02,784 --> 00:44:04,183
Good gracious!

505
00:44:04,664 --> 00:44:07,736
Perhaps as a reminder
of my feelings for you.

506
00:44:08,144 --> 00:44:10,020
- Is it a —
- Diamond? Yes.

507
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,972
56 carats to be exact.

508
00:44:17,463 --> 00:44:19,374
It was worn by Louis XVI.

509
00:44:20,303 --> 00:44:22,692
And they called it "Le Coeur de la Mer".

510
00:44:22,783 --> 00:44:26,093
- The "Heart of the Ocean".
- The "Heart of the Ocean". Yes.

511
00:44:31,063 --> 00:44:32,701
It's overwhelming.

512
00:44:32,983 --> 00:44:34,780
It's for royalty.

513
00:44:35,863 --> 00:44:37,614
We are royalty, Rose.

514
00:44:41,783 --> 00:44:44,660
You know, there is nothing
I couldn't give you.

515
00:44:44,822 --> 00:44:46,858
There is nothing I'd deny you ...

516
00:44:47,302 --> 00:44:49,133
if you would not deny me.

517
00:44:53,462 --> 00:44:55,532
Open your heart to me, Rose.

518
00:45:10,742 --> 00:45:12,972
I've been on my own since I was 15.

519
00:45:13,061 --> 00:45:14,734
Since my folks died.

520
00:45:15,501 --> 00:45:19,210
And I had no brothers or sisters
or close kin in that part of the country.

521
00:45:19,581 --> 00:45:22,414
So I lit on out of there
and I haven't been back since.

522
00:45:22,501 --> 00:45:25,732
You can just call me
a tumbleweed blowing in the wind.

523
00:45:27,661 --> 00:45:31,495
Well, Rose, we've walked
about a mile around this boat deck ...

524
00:45:32,221 --> 00:45:35,418
chewed over how great
the weather's been and how I grew up ...

525
00:45:35,701 --> 00:45:39,216
but I reckon that's not
why you came to talk to me, is it?

526
00:45:40,341 --> 00:45:42,013
- Mr. Dawson, I —
- Jack.

527
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,329
Jack ...

528
00:45:44,781 --> 00:45:47,248
I want to thank you for what you did.

529
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:51,059
Not just for pulling me back ...

530
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:54,333
- but for your discretion.
- You're welcome.

531
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:56,089
Look ...

532
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:59,009
I know what you must be thinking:

533
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,810
"Poor little rich girl.
What does she know about misery?"

534
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,489
No.

535
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,458
That's not what I was thinking.

536
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:09,293
What I was thinking was ...

537
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:13,055
what could have happened to this girl
to make her think she had no way out?

538
00:46:14,659 --> 00:46:15,979
Well, I ...

539
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,253
It was everything.

540
00:46:18,339 --> 00:46:21,490
It was my whole world
and all the people in it.

541
00:46:21,899 --> 00:46:23,810
And the inertia of my life ...

542
00:46:24,179 --> 00:46:26,977
plunging ahead,
and me, powerless to stop it.

543
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:29,536
God, look at that thing.

544
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:32,253
You'd have gone straight 
to the bottom.

545
00:46:33,619 --> 00:46:36,213
500 invitations have gone out.

546
00:46:36,299 --> 00:46:38,972
All of Philadelphia society 
will be there.

547
00:46:39,059 --> 00:46:41,368
And all the while, I feel I'm  ...

548
00:46:41,459 --> 00:46:43,654
standing in the middle of
a crowded room ...

549
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:46,697
screaming at the top of my lungs,
and no one even looks up.

550
00:46:48,099 --> 00:46:49,612
Do you love him?

551
00:46:50,458 --> 00:46:51,652
Pardon me?

552
00:46:51,738 --> 00:46:53,251
Do you love him?

553
00:46:53,698 --> 00:46:56,849
You're being very rude.
You shouldn't be asking me this.

554
00:46:56,938 --> 00:47:00,055
It's a simple question.
Do you love the guy or not?

555
00:47:01,658 --> 00:47:03,614
This is not a suitable conversation.

556
00:47:03,698 --> 00:47:06,258
Why can't you 
just answer the question?

557
00:47:07,498 --> 00:47:08,977
This is absurd.

558
00:47:09,138 --> 00:47:10,935
You don't know me 
and I don't know you ...

559
00:47:11,018 --> 00:47:13,452
and we are not having
this conversation at all.

560
00:47:13,538 --> 00:47:16,336
You are rude and uncouth
and presumptuous and ...

561
00:47:16,418 --> 00:47:17,771
I am leaving now.

562
00:47:17,858 --> 00:47:20,417
Jack, Mr. Dawson, 
it's been a pleasure.

563
00:47:20,498 --> 00:47:22,887
I sought you out to thank you
and now I have thanked you —

564
00:47:22,977 --> 00:47:24,774
And you've insulted me.

565
00:47:24,897 --> 00:47:26,455
Well, you deserved it.

566
00:47:26,537 --> 00:47:27,970
- Right.
- Right.

567
00:47:30,737 --> 00:47:33,092
- I thought you were leaving.
- I am.

568
00:47:35,737 --> 00:47:37,455
You are so annoying.

569
00:47:38,417 --> 00:47:40,567
Wait, I don't have to leave.

570
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:43,251
This is my part of the ship. 
You leave.

571
00:47:44,017 --> 00:47:46,611
Well, well, well! 
Now who's being rude?

572
00:47:50,697 --> 00:47:53,733
What is this stupid thing
you're carrying around?

573
00:47:54,616 --> 00:47:57,255
So, what are you, 
an artist or something?

574
00:48:00,936 --> 00:48:02,733
These are rather good.

575
00:48:05,656 --> 00:48:08,454
They're — they're very good, actually.

576
00:48:15,616 --> 00:48:17,527
Jack, this is exquisite work.

577
00:48:17,616 --> 00:48:20,335
They didn't think too much
of them in old Paree.

578
00:48:20,416 --> 00:48:21,484
Paris?

579
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:24,926
You do get around for a ...

580
00:48:28,055 --> 00:48:30,091
Well, a person of limited means.

581
00:48:30,175 --> 00:48:32,450
Go on, a poor guy. You can say it.

582
00:48:35,815 --> 00:48:37,373
Well, well, well.

583
00:48:41,855 --> 00:48:44,050
And these were drawn from life?

584
00:48:46,735 --> 00:48:48,805
That's one of the good things 
about Paris.

585
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:51,852
Lots of girls willing to take
their clothes off.

586
00:48:56,815 --> 00:48:58,567
You liked this woman.

587
00:48:58,815 --> 00:49:00,805
You used her several times.

588
00:49:03,694 --> 00:49:06,003
Well, she had beautiful hands, 
you see?

589
00:49:08,174 --> 00:49:10,244
I think you must have had
a love affair with her.

590
00:49:10,334 --> 00:49:12,564
No, no, no, no — just with her hands.

591
00:49:13,094 --> 00:49:15,369
She was a one-legged prostitute.

592
00:49:16,654 --> 00:49:17,643
See?

593
00:49:23,734 --> 00:49:26,293
She had a good sense of humor, though.

594
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:29,846
And this lady ...

595
00:49:30,813 --> 00:49:33,247
she used to sit 
at this bar every night ...

596
00:49:33,333 --> 00:49:35,847
wearing every piece of jewelry
she owned just ...

597
00:49:35,933 --> 00:49:38,367
waiting for her long lost love.

598
00:49:38,853 --> 00:49:40,889
We called her Madame Bijoux.

599
00:49:41,293 --> 00:49:43,727
See, her clothes are all moth-eaten.

600
00:49:44,893 --> 00:49:47,043
Well, you have a gift, Jack.

601
00:49:47,853 --> 00:49:48,968
You do.

602
00:49:49,613 --> 00:49:52,332
- You see people.
- I see you.

603
00:49:54,733 --> 00:49:55,767
And?

604
00:49:57,533 --> 00:49:59,489
You wouldn't have jumped.

605
00:50:03,213 --> 00:50:06,761
But the purpose of university
is to find a suitable husband.

606
00:50:07,012 --> 00:50:08,968
Rose has already done that.

607
00:50:09,052 --> 00:50:11,725
Look, here comes that vulgar
"Brown" woman.

608
00:50:11,932 --> 00:50:14,571
Quickly, get up 
before she sits with us.

609
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:18,126
Hello, girls.
I was hoping I'd catch you at tea.

610
00:50:18,212 --> 00:50:20,282
We're awfully sorry. You missed it.

611
00:50:20,372 --> 00:50:23,330
The Countess and I were just off
to take the air on the boat deck.

612
00:50:23,412 --> 00:50:26,563
What a lovely idea.
I need to catch up on my gossip.

613
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:30,880
Countess.

614
00:50:32,331 --> 00:50:35,004
You've not yet lit 
the last 4 boilers?

615
00:50:35,371 --> 00:50:37,248
No, I don't see the need.

616
00:50:37,331 --> 00:50:39,367
We are making excellent time.

617
00:50:40,011 --> 00:50:41,922
The press knows the size of Titanic.

618
00:50:42,011 --> 00:50:44,320
Now, I want them to marvel at her speed.

619
00:50:44,411 --> 00:50:47,050
We must give them
something new to print.

620
00:50:48,571 --> 00:50:51,688
This maiden voyage of Titanic
must make headlines.

621
00:50:52,811 --> 00:50:54,210
Mr. Ismay ...

622
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:59,323
I would prefer not to push the engines
until they've been properly run in.

623
00:51:00,171 --> 00:51:01,604
Of course, I'm just a passenger.

624
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:04,329
I leave it to your good offices
to decide what's best.

625
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:07,004
But what a glorious end
to your final crossing ...

626
00:51:07,091 --> 00:51:10,366
if we were to get into New York
on Tuesday night and surprise them all.

627
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:12,327
Make the morning papers.

628
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:14,560
Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?

629
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:19,358
Good man.

630
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:22,890
Well, after that, I worked 
on a squid boat in Monterey,

631
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:26,243
then I went down to Los Angeles
to the pier in Santa Monica ...

632
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:29,606
and started doing portraits there
for 10 cents a piece.

633
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:31,886
Why can't I be like you, Jack?

634
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:35,245
Just head out for the horizon
whenever I feel like it.

635
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:39,927
Say we'll go there sometime, 
to that pier ...

636
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:42,523
even if we only ever 
just talk about it.

637
00:51:42,609 --> 00:51:45,282
No, we'll do it. 
We'll drink cheap beer,

638
00:51:45,529 --> 00:51:48,407
we'll ride on the roller coaster
till we throw up.

639
00:51:48,489 --> 00:51:51,561
Then we'll ride horses on the beach,
right in the surf.

640
00:51:51,649 --> 00:51:55,642
But you'll have to do it like a real 
cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.

641
00:51:55,969 --> 00:51:58,483
- You mean, one leg on each side?
- Yeah.

642
00:52:00,009 --> 00:52:02,443
- Can you show me?
- Sure, if you like.

643
00:52:04,369 --> 00:52:06,200
Teach me to ride like a man.

644
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,165
And chew tobacco like a man.

645
00:52:08,848 --> 00:52:10,726
And spit like a man.

646
00:52:10,808 --> 00:52:13,197
What, they didn't teach you that
in finishing school?

647
00:52:13,288 --> 00:52:14,277
No.

648
00:52:15,008 --> 00:52:17,124
Come on, I'll show you. Let's do it.

649
00:52:17,208 --> 00:52:18,561
I'll show you how, come on.

650
00:52:18,648 --> 00:52:20,445
- Jack, no.
- Come on.

651
00:52:20,528 --> 00:52:22,405
- No. Wait, Jack.
- Come on.

652
00:52:22,728 --> 00:52:24,958
No, Jack. I couldn't possibly, Jack.

653
00:52:25,048 --> 00:52:26,481
Watch closely.

654
00:52:28,448 --> 00:52:30,040
That's disgusting.

655
00:52:30,288 --> 00:52:32,006
All right, your turn.

656
00:52:33,248 --> 00:52:35,682
That was pitiful.
Come on, you really gotta hawk it back.

657
00:52:35,768 --> 00:52:38,327
Get some leverage to it, 
use your arms ...

658
00:52:38,408 --> 00:52:39,841
arc your neck.

659
00:52:40,607 --> 00:52:42,837
You see the range on that thing?

660
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:44,760
Okay, go.

661
00:52:47,807 --> 00:52:50,002
- That was better. You got to work on it.
- Really?

662
00:52:50,087 --> 00:52:53,796
Really try to hawk it up
and get some body to it. You gotta ...

663
00:53:00,407 --> 00:53:01,556
Mother.

664
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:08,757
May I introduce Jack Dawson?

665
00:53:10,167 --> 00:53:11,805
Charmed, I'm sure.

666
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:18,681
The others were gracious 
and curious ...

667
00:53:18,766 --> 00:53:21,075
about the man who'd saved my life.

668
00:53:22,166 --> 00:53:24,885
But my mother looked at him
like an insect.

669
00:53:25,286 --> 00:53:28,995
A dangerous insect
which must be squashed quickly.

670
00:53:29,646 --> 00:53:33,639
Jack, sounds like you're a good man
to have around in a sticky spot.

671
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:38,355
Why do they always insist on
announcing dinner ...

672
00:53:38,446 --> 00:53:40,436
like a damn cavalry charge?

673
00:53:40,806 --> 00:53:42,796
Shall we go dress, Mother?

674
00:53:43,446 --> 00:53:45,322
See you at dinner, Jack.

675
00:53:47,245 --> 00:53:48,280
Son?

676
00:53:48,566 --> 00:53:49,600
Son!

677
00:53:50,325 --> 00:53:53,522
Do you have the slightest comprehension
of what you're doing?

678
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:54,640
Not really.

679
00:53:54,725 --> 00:53:57,193
You're about to go into the snake pit.

680
00:53:59,285 --> 00:54:01,435
What are you planning to wear?

681
00:54:04,005 --> 00:54:05,677
I figured. Come on.

682
00:54:08,325 --> 00:54:09,804
I was right.

683
00:54:10,285 --> 00:54:12,673
You and my son
are just about the same size.

684
00:54:12,765 --> 00:54:14,163
Pretty close.

685
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:20,120
You shine up like a new penny.

686
00:54:31,604 --> 00:54:33,196
Good evening, sir.

687
00:55:34,562 --> 00:55:37,679
There are several thousand tons
of Hockley steel in this very ship.

688
00:55:37,762 --> 00:55:39,957
- Which part?
- All the right ones, of course.

689
00:55:40,042 --> 00:55:42,431
Then we'll know who to hold accountable
if there's a problem.

690
00:55:42,522 --> 00:55:44,672
- Where's my daughter?
- She'll be along.

691
00:55:44,762 --> 00:55:46,514
There is the Countess.

692
00:55:46,642 --> 00:55:48,394
- Hello, my dear.
- Good evening, Cal.

693
00:55:48,482 --> 00:55:50,278
So good to see you.

694
00:56:14,641 --> 00:56:18,270
I saw that in a nickelodeon once
and I always wanted to do it.

695
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,392
I'll see you at dinner.

696
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,994
Darling ...

697
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,555
surely you remember Mr. Dawson.

698
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,114
Dawson.

699
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,599
That's amazing.

700
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,474
You could almost pass 
for a gentleman.

701
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:43,994
Almost.

702
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,798
Extraordinary.

703
00:56:56,999 --> 00:56:59,593
My dear, it's delightful to see you.

704
00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:00,993
What a remarkable voyage this is.

705
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:03,547
- It's mad, isn't it?
- Completely lunatic.

706
00:57:04,519 --> 00:57:06,749
There's the Countess of Rothes.

707
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:11,669
And that's John Jacob Astor ...

708
00:57:11,959 --> 00:57:13,677
the richest man on the ship.

709
00:57:13,759 --> 00:57:17,593
His little wifey there, Madeleine,
is my age, and in a delicate condition.

710
00:57:18,399 --> 00:57:20,151
See how she's trying to hide it?

711
00:57:20,239 --> 00:57:21,797
Quite the scandal.

712
00:57:22,279 --> 00:57:25,669
And that's Benjamin Guggenheim
and his mistress, Madame Aubert.

713
00:57:25,758 --> 00:57:28,875
Mrs. Guggenheim is at home
with the children, of course.

714
00:57:28,959 --> 00:57:32,348
And over here, we have Sir Cosmo
and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon.

715
00:57:32,438 --> 00:57:35,669
She designs naughty lingerie,
among her many talents.

716
00:57:35,998 --> 00:57:38,114
Very popular with the royals.

717
00:57:38,958 --> 00:57:41,392
Congratulations, Hockley. 
She's splendid.

718
00:57:41,478 --> 00:57:42,911
Why, thank you.

719
00:57:43,398 --> 00:57:46,276
- Care to escort a lady to dinner?
- Certainly.

720
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:49,277
Sweet pea?

721
00:57:50,438 --> 00:57:53,475
Ain't nothing to it, is there, Jack?
Remember, they love money.

722
00:57:53,558 --> 00:57:56,675
So just pretend like you own a 
gold mine and you're in the club.

723
00:57:59,078 --> 00:58:00,305
Hey, Astor.

724
00:58:01,397 --> 00:58:03,627
Hello, Molly, nice to see you.

725
00:58:04,157 --> 00:58:06,671
J.J., Madeleine,
I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.

726
00:58:06,757 --> 00:58:08,190
- How do you do?
- Pleasure.

727
00:58:08,277 --> 00:58:09,710
Well, Jack ...

728
00:58:10,117 --> 00:58:12,233
are you of the Boston Dawsons?

729
00:58:12,677 --> 00:58:15,271
No, the Chippewa Falls 
Dawsons, actually.

730
00:58:15,357 --> 00:58:16,506
Oh, yes.

731
00:58:18,517 --> 00:58:21,634
He must have been nervous,
but he never faltered.

732
00:58:23,117 --> 00:58:25,267
They assumed he was one of them.

733
00:58:25,357 --> 00:58:27,951
Heir to a railroad fortune, perhaps.

734
00:58:28,957 --> 00:58:32,187
New money, obviously,
but still a member of the club.

735
00:58:33,596 --> 00:58:36,633
Mother, of course,
could always be counted upon.

736
00:58:37,476 --> 00:58:40,434
Tell us of the accommodations
in steerage, Mr. Dawson.

737
00:58:40,516 --> 00:58:42,234
I hear they're quite good 
on this ship.

738
00:58:43,636 --> 00:58:46,389
The best I've seen, ma'am. 
Hardly any rats.

739
00:58:49,596 --> 00:58:52,315
Mr. Dawson is joining us
from the third class.

740
00:58:52,396 --> 00:58:54,785
He was of some assistance
to my fiancée last night.

741
00:58:54,876 --> 00:58:57,629
It turns out that Mr. Dawson
is quite a fine artist.

742
00:58:57,716 --> 00:59:00,708
He was kind enough to show me
some of his work today.

743
00:59:00,796 --> 00:59:03,788
Rose and I differ somewhat
in our definition of fine art.

744
00:59:03,876 --> 00:59:05,945
Not to impugn your work, sir.

745
00:59:15,835 --> 00:59:17,029
Are these all for me?

746
00:59:17,115 --> 00:59:19,106
Just start from the outside
and work your way in.

747
00:59:19,195 --> 00:59:21,470
He knows every rivet in her,
don't you, Thomas?

748
00:59:21,555 --> 00:59:24,023
Your ship is a wonder, 
Mr. Andrews. Truly.

749
00:59:24,115 --> 00:59:25,628
Thank you, Rose.

750
00:59:28,475 --> 00:59:29,954
How do you take your caviar, sir?

751
00:59:30,035 --> 00:59:31,831
No caviar for me, thanks.

752
00:59:31,915 --> 00:59:33,746
Never did like it much.

753
00:59:34,995 --> 00:59:37,667
And where exactly do you live,
Mr. Dawson?

754
00:59:37,834 --> 00:59:40,632
Right now, my address 
is the RMS Titanic.

755
00:59:41,274 --> 00:59:43,424
After that, I'm on God's good humor.

756
00:59:43,514 --> 00:59:46,074
And how is it you have means to travel?

757
00:59:46,154 --> 00:59:48,270
I work my way from place to place.

758
00:59:48,354 --> 00:59:50,549
You know, tramp steamers and such.

759
00:59:50,634 --> 00:59:54,024
But I won my ticket on Titanic here
at a lucky hand at poker.

760
00:59:54,154 --> 00:59:55,746
A very lucky hand.

761
00:59:56,474 --> 00:59:58,510
All life is a game of luck.

762
00:59:59,674 --> 01:00:02,507
A real man makes his own luck, 
Archie. Right, Dawson?

763
01:00:03,954 --> 01:00:07,662
And you find that sort of rootless 
existence appealing, do you?

764
01:00:10,593 --> 01:00:12,185
Yes, ma'am, I do.

765
01:00:12,793 --> 01:00:15,910
I mean, I've got everything I need
right here with me.

766
01:00:15,993 --> 01:00:19,303
I got air in my lungs
and a few blank sheets of paper.

767
01:00:19,913 --> 01:00:23,110
I love waking up in the morning
not knowing what's gonna happen ...

768
01:00:23,433 --> 01:00:25,230
or who I'm gonna meet ...

769
01:00:25,313 --> 01:00:27,031
where I'm gonna wind up.

770
01:00:27,113 --> 01:00:29,752
Just the other night I was sleeping
under a bridge, and now ...

771
01:00:29,833 --> 01:00:31,983
here I am on the grandest 
ship in the world ...

772
01:00:32,073 --> 01:00:33,711
having champagne with you fine people.

773
01:00:33,793 --> 01:00:35,590
I'll take some more of that.

774
01:00:35,993 --> 01:00:39,507
I figure life is a gift
and I don't intend on wasting it.

775
01:00:39,953 --> 01:00:42,547
You never know what hand
you're gonna get dealt next.

776
01:00:42,632 --> 01:00:44,782
You learn to take life 
as it comes at you.

777
01:00:44,872 --> 01:00:46,385
Here you go, Cal.

778
01:00:47,792 --> 01:00:49,589
To make each day count.

779
01:00:50,272 --> 01:00:52,388
- Well said, Jack.
- Hear, hear.

780
01:00:53,432 --> 01:00:55,150
To making it count.

781
01:00:56,312 --> 01:00:57,984
To making it count!

782
01:00:58,592 --> 01:00:59,741
Bravo.

783
01:01:05,872 --> 01:01:09,421
But Mr. Brown had no idea
I'd hidden the money in the stove.

784
01:01:10,671 --> 01:01:14,585
So he comes home drunk as a pig,
celebrating, and he lights a fire.

785
01:01:17,151 --> 01:01:18,186
Bravo.

786
01:01:18,271 --> 01:01:20,910
Next it'll be brandies 
in the smoking room.

787
01:01:22,351 --> 01:01:25,343
- Join me in a brandy, gentlemen?
- What a good idea.

788
01:01:25,871 --> 01:01:29,022
Now they retreat into a cloud of smoke
and congratulate each other ...

789
01:01:29,111 --> 01:01:30,703
on being masters of the universe.

790
01:01:30,791 --> 01:01:33,669
Ladies, thank you for the pleasure
of your company.

791
01:01:33,751 --> 01:01:35,309
Rose, may I escort you to the cabin?

792
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:37,063
No, I'll stay here.

793
01:01:37,271 --> 01:01:38,943
Here you go, Molly.

794
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:41,149
Joining us, Dawson?

795
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:44,427
You don't want to stay out here
with the women, do you?

796
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:47,786
- No, thanks, I've got to be heading back.
- Probably best.

797
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:50,259
It'll be all business and politics,
that sort of thing.

798
01:01:50,350 --> 01:01:52,147
Wouldn't interest you.

799
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:53,709
But, Dawson ...

800
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:55,828
good of you to come.

801
01:02:00,270 --> 01:02:01,703
Jack, must you go?

802
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:04,588
Time for me to go row
with the other slaves.

803
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:08,822
Good night, Rose.

804
01:02:47,188 --> 01:02:49,383
So you want to go to a real party?

805
01:02:59,588 --> 01:03:02,022
Is okay if I put my hand here? Okay.

806
01:03:16,548 --> 01:03:17,617
What?

807
01:03:20,227 --> 01:03:22,024
I can't understand you.

808
01:03:53,146 --> 01:03:55,580
I'm going to dance 
with her now, all right?

809
01:03:55,666 --> 01:03:56,815
Come on.

810
01:03:56,906 --> 01:03:58,339
- What?
- Come on.

811
01:03:58,426 --> 01:04:00,735
- Come with me.
- Jack! Jack, wait.

812
01:04:03,346 --> 01:04:04,540
I can't do this.

813
01:04:04,626 --> 01:04:07,936
We're gonna have to get
a little bit closer, like this.

814
01:04:10,706 --> 01:04:12,981
You're still my best girl, Cora.

815
01:04:15,626 --> 01:04:18,777
- I don't know the steps.
- Neither do I, just go with it.

816
01:04:18,866 --> 01:04:20,219
Don't think.

817
01:04:38,505 --> 01:04:41,144
Wait, Jack! Stop!

818
01:04:50,504 --> 01:04:51,904
Stop! Wait!

819
01:05:31,623 --> 01:05:33,295
Jack, no.

820
01:05:39,023 --> 01:05:41,014
... beyond the jurisdiction
of the Sherman Act.

821
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:42,741
So my lawyers will argue.

822
01:05:42,823 --> 01:05:46,179
That's what Rockefeller said, but
the Supreme Court is not swallowing it.

823
01:06:05,582 --> 01:06:06,651
What?

824
01:06:06,742 --> 01:06:09,415
You think a first-class girl 
can't drink?

825
01:06:11,462 --> 01:06:12,975
Get out of here.

826
01:06:13,062 --> 01:06:14,620
You all right?

827
01:06:16,182 --> 01:06:17,297
I'm fine.

828
01:06:17,382 --> 01:06:18,940
2 out of 3.

829
01:06:20,342 --> 01:06:21,377
So ...

830
01:06:22,622 --> 01:06:24,852
you think you're big tough men?

831
01:06:25,742 --> 01:06:27,538
Let's see you do this.

832
01:06:29,301 --> 01:06:31,690
Hold this for me, Jack. Hold it up.

833
01:06:48,821 --> 01:06:50,539
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

834
01:06:50,621 --> 01:06:53,658
- Are you all right?
- I haven't done that in years.

835
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:29,773
Coffee, sir?

836
01:07:39,299 --> 01:07:41,813
I had hoped you would come to me
last night.

837
01:07:42,979 --> 01:07:44,298
I was tired.

838
01:07:47,059 --> 01:07:50,369
Your exertions below decks were,
no doubt, exhausting.

839
01:07:52,299 --> 01:07:56,133
I see you had that undertaker
of a manservant follow me. How typical.

840
01:07:56,219 --> 01:07:59,973
You will never behave like that again,
Rose, do you understand?

841
01:08:02,218 --> 01:08:05,767
I'm not a foreman in one of 
your mills that you can command.

842
01:08:06,738 --> 01:08:08,296
I'm your fiancée.

843
01:08:10,898 --> 01:08:12,456
My fiancée!

844
01:08:12,778 --> 01:08:14,689
Yes, you are, and my wife!

845
01:08:15,338 --> 01:08:19,377
My wife in practice, if not yet 
by law. So you will honor me.

846
01:08:19,858 --> 01:08:22,850
You'll honor me the way a wife 
is required to honor her husband.

847
01:08:22,938 --> 01:08:25,657
Because I will not be made
out a fool, Rose.

848
01:08:25,738 --> 01:08:27,729
Is this in any way unclear?

849
01:08:28,498 --> 01:08:29,487
No.

850
01:08:29,818 --> 01:08:32,173
Good. Excuse me.

851
01:08:37,577 --> 01:08:38,852
Miss Rose.

852
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:43,177
- We had a little accident.
- That's all right, Miss Rose.

853
01:08:43,257 --> 01:08:44,849
- Sorry, Trudy.
- It's all right.

854
01:08:44,937 --> 01:08:46,211
Let me help you.

855
01:08:46,297 --> 01:08:48,015
It's all right, miss.

856
01:08:53,817 --> 01:08:55,216
It's all right, miss.

857
01:09:00,897 --> 01:09:03,286
- Tea, Trudy.
- Yes, ma'am.

858
01:09:18,816 --> 01:09:21,967
You are not to see that boy again.
Do you understand me?

859
01:09:23,136 --> 01:09:25,411
Rose, I forbid it.

860
01:09:26,376 --> 01:09:29,493
Stop it, Mother.
You'll give yourself a nosebleed.

861
01:09:29,576 --> 01:09:31,248
This is not a game.

862
01:09:31,696 --> 01:09:33,766
Our situation is precarious.

863
01:09:33,856 --> 01:09:35,335
You know the money's gone.

864
01:09:35,416 --> 01:09:37,452
Of course I know it's gone.

865
01:09:37,935 --> 01:09:39,813
You remind me every day.

866
01:09:40,535 --> 01:09:45,086
Your father left us nothing but a legacy
of bad debts hidden by a good name.

867
01:09:45,575 --> 01:09:48,294
That name is the only card
we have to play.

868
01:09:48,775 --> 01:09:50,606
I don't understand you.

869
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:54,570
It is a fine match with Hockley.
It will ensure our survival.

870
01:09:56,135 --> 01:09:58,012
How can you put this on my shoulders?

871
01:09:58,095 --> 01:09:59,813
Why are you being so selfish?

872
01:09:59,895 --> 01:10:01,487
I'm being selfish?

873
01:10:04,895 --> 01:10:07,773
Do you want to see me working
as a seamstress?

874
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:11,251
Is that what you want?

875
01:10:13,654 --> 01:10:16,248
To see our fine things 
sold at auction?

876
01:10:18,094 --> 01:10:20,483
Our memories scattered to the winds?

877
01:10:30,534 --> 01:10:32,092
It's so unfair.

878
01:10:33,694 --> 01:10:35,571
Of course it's unfair.

879
01:10:36,534 --> 01:10:37,853
We're women.

880
01:10:40,294 --> 01:10:42,330
Our choices are never easy.

- Hello, Mr. Andrews.
- Hello, Jack.

889
01:11:49,371 --> 01:11:51,202
I just need to talk to somebody
for a second.

890
01:11:51,292 --> 01:11:54,647
- Sir, you're not supposed to be in here.
- I just need to speak to someone.

891
01:11:57,611 --> 01:11:59,522
I was just here last night,
you don't remember me?

892
01:11:59,611 --> 01:12:00,646
No, I'm afraid I don't.

893
01:12:00,731 --> 01:12:03,199
- Now, you're gonna have to turn around.
- He'll tell you.

894
01:12:03,291 --> 01:12:04,644
I just need to talk —

895
01:12:04,731 --> 01:12:07,450
Mr. Hockley and Mrs. Dewitt Bukater ...

896
01:12:08,131 --> 01:12:10,725
continue to be appreciative
of your assistance.

897
01:12:11,051 --> 01:12:14,487
They asked me to give you this
in gratitude.

898
01:12:14,571 --> 01:12:16,243
I don't want your money. Please. 
I just —

899
01:12:16,331 --> 01:12:19,447
Also to remind you
that you hold a third-class ticket ...

900
01:12:19,531 --> 01:12:22,283
and that your presence here
is no longer appropriate.

901
01:12:22,370 --> 01:12:24,406
Please, I just wanna speak 
to Rose for one second.

902
01:12:24,491 --> 01:12:28,199
Gentlemen, please see Mr. Dawson
gets back to where he belongs ...

903
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:30,167
and that he stays there.

904
01:12:30,530 --> 01:12:32,521
Yes, sir. Come along, you.

905
01:12:34,890 --> 01:12:37,529
♪ Hear us when we cry to Thee ♪

906
01:12:37,810 --> 01:12:42,600

907
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:45,486
And why do you have
2 steering wheels?

908
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:48,004
- We really only use this near shore.
- Excuse me, sir.

909
01:12:48,090 --> 01:12:50,650
Another ice warning.
This one is from the Noordam.

910
01:12:50,730 --> 01:12:52,367
Thank you, Sparks.

911
01:12:54,209 --> 01:12:57,679
Not to worry.
Quite normal for this time of year.

912
01:12:58,249 --> 01:13:02,003
In fact, we're speeding up.
I've just ordered the last boilers lit.

913
01:13:05,969 --> 01:13:09,006
Okay, son, wind it up tight
like I showed you. That's right.

914
01:13:09,089 --> 01:13:10,807
Okay, now, let it go.

915
01:13:16,689 --> 01:13:18,281
That's excellent.

916
01:13:22,288 --> 01:13:24,757
Mr. Andrews, forgive me ...

917
01:13:25,649 --> 01:13:27,525
I did the sum in my head ...

918
01:13:27,608 --> 01:13:31,396
and with the number of lifeboats
times the capacity you mentioned ...

919
01:13:31,488 --> 01:13:35,242
Forgive me, but it seems that there are
not enough for everyone aboard.

920
01:13:35,328 --> 01:13:37,046
About half, actually.

921
01:13:37,768 --> 01:13:39,963
Rose, you miss nothing, do you?

922
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:42,437
In fact, I put in 
these new-type davits ...

923
01:13:42,528 --> 01:13:45,645
which can take an extra row of boats
inside this one.

924
01:13:45,728 --> 01:13:47,878
But it was thought, by some ...

925
01:13:47,968 --> 01:13:49,799
the deck would look too cluttered.

926
01:13:49,888 --> 01:13:51,560
So, I was overruled.

927
01:13:52,208 --> 01:13:55,359
It's a waste of deck space as it is
in an unsinkable ship.

928
01:13:55,448 --> 01:13:57,244
Sleep soundly, young Rose.

929
01:13:57,328 --> 01:14:00,125
I have built you a good ship,
strong and true.

930
01:14:00,208 --> 01:14:02,004
She's all the lifeboat you need.

931
01:14:02,087 --> 01:14:05,159
Keep heading aft.
The next stop will be the engine room.

932
01:14:05,247 --> 01:14:06,396
Come on.

933
01:14:11,367 --> 01:14:14,325
Jack, this is impossible. 
I can't see you.

934
01:14:14,407 --> 01:14:16,682
- I need to talk to you.
- No, Jack. No.

935
01:14:18,647 --> 01:14:20,558
Jack, I'm engaged.

936
01:14:21,847 --> 01:14:23,405
I'm marrying Cal.

937
01:14:24,327 --> 01:14:25,646
I love Cal.

938
01:14:29,326 --> 01:14:31,681
Rose, you're no picnic, all right?

939
01:14:31,766 --> 01:14:34,155
You're a spoiled little brat, even.

940
01:14:34,246 --> 01:14:37,079
But under that,
you're the most amazingly ...

941
01:14:37,646 --> 01:14:39,955
astounding, wonderful girl ...

942
01:14:40,566 --> 01:14:43,205
Woman that I've ever known and —

943
01:14:43,286 --> 01:14:45,481
- Jack, I —
- No, let me try to get this out.

944
01:14:45,566 --> 01:14:46,885
You're making ...

945
01:14:49,126 --> 01:14:52,004
I'm not an idiot.
I know how the world works.

946
01:14:52,086 --> 01:14:53,883
I've got $10 in my pocket.

947
01:14:53,966 --> 01:14:56,799
I have nothing to offer you
and I know that.

948
01:14:57,086 --> 01:14:58,485
I understand.

949
01:14:59,566 --> 01:15:01,442
But I'm too involved now.

950
01:15:01,525 --> 01:15:03,436
You jump, I jump, remember?

951
01:15:03,525 --> 01:15:06,801
I can't turn away without knowing
you'll be all right.

952
01:15:07,365 --> 01:15:09,196
That's all that I want.

953
01:15:10,165 --> 01:15:11,678
Well, I'm fine.

954
01:15:12,645 --> 01:15:14,556
I'll be fine. Really.

955
01:15:15,885 --> 01:15:17,034
Really?

956
01:15:18,885 --> 01:15:20,477
I don't think so.

957
01:15:21,685 --> 01:15:23,198
They have got you trapped, Rose.

958
01:15:23,285 --> 01:15:25,276
And you're gonna die
if you don't break free.

959
01:15:25,365 --> 01:15:28,162
Maybe not right away,
because you're strong ...

960
01:15:29,124 --> 01:15:32,673
but sooner or later, that fire 
that I love about you, Rose ...

961
01:15:32,765 --> 01:15:34,880
that fire's going to burn out.

962
01:15:39,844 --> 01:15:42,233
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.

963
01:15:43,564 --> 01:15:44,997
You're right.

964
01:15:46,084 --> 01:15:47,836
Only you can do that.

965
01:15:53,764 --> 01:15:56,278
I'm going back. Leave me alone.

966
01:16:08,163 --> 01:16:11,280
Tell Lucile about the disaster 
you had with the stationers.

967
01:16:11,363 --> 01:16:14,002
Of course, the invitations had to be
sent back, twice.

968
01:16:14,083 --> 01:16:16,961
- Oh, my dear.
- And the dreadful bridesmaids' gowns.

969
01:16:17,043 --> 01:16:19,477
Let me tell you,
what an odyssey that has been.

970
01:16:19,563 --> 01:16:23,272
Rose decided she wanted lavender.
She knows I detest the color.

971
01:16:23,363 --> 01:16:25,399
She did it to spite me.

972
01:16:25,483 --> 01:16:27,599
If only you'd come to me sooner.

973
01:16:27,683 --> 01:16:29,913
Ruth saw some of my designs
in La Mode lllustrée ...

974
01:16:30,003 --> 01:16:31,152
they were for the trousseau ...

975
01:16:31,243 --> 01:16:34,235
of the Duchess of Marlborough's youngest
daughter. They were quite charming.

976
01:16:34,323 --> 01:16:36,552
I think you'll agree, my dear,
that together ...

977
01:16:37,202 --> 01:16:39,921
we've created something 
of a phoenix from the ashes.

978
01:16:54,162 --> 01:16:55,515
Hello, Jack.

979
01:17:00,802 --> 01:17:02,394
I changed my mind.

980
01:17:08,322 --> 01:17:10,438
They said you might be up here —

981
01:17:12,121 --> 01:17:13,759
Give me your hand.

982
01:17:20,681 --> 01:17:22,399
Now close your eyes.

983
01:17:23,401 --> 01:17:24,550
Go on.

984
01:17:27,681 --> 01:17:29,034
Now step up.

985
01:17:32,961 --> 01:17:35,680
Now hold on to the railing.
Keep your eyes closed.

986
01:17:35,761 --> 01:17:37,479
- Don't peek.
- I'm not.

987
01:17:38,721 --> 01:17:40,552
Step up onto the rail.

988
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:46,590
Hold on. Hold on.

989
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:48,591
Keep your eyes closed.

990
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:51,753
- Do you trust me?
- I trust you.

991
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:04,233
All right, open your eyes.

992
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,069
I'm flying. Jack.

993
01:18:37,239 --> 01:18:40,834
♪ Come, Josephine, 
in my flying machine ♪

994
01:18:40,918 --> 01:18:45,673
♪ Going up she goes, up she goes ♪

995
01:19:31,557 --> 01:19:34,629
That was the last time Titanic
ever saw daylight.

996
01:19:35,477 --> 01:19:38,196
We're up to dusk, 
the night of the sinking.

997
01:19:38,437 --> 01:19:40,553
- 6 hours to go.
- Incredible.

998
01:19:40,757 --> 01:19:42,429
There's Smith, 
and he's standing there ...

999
01:19:42,517 --> 01:19:44,906
and he's got the iceberg warning
in his fucking hand.

1000
01:19:44,997 --> 01:19:47,749
Excuse me, his hand,
and he's ordering more speed.

1001
01:19:47,836 --> 01:19:50,555
26 years of experience working
against him.

1002
01:19:51,116 --> 01:19:55,234
He figures anything big enough to sink
the ship, they're gonna see in time to turn.

1003
01:19:55,316 --> 01:19:57,955
But the ship's too big
with too small a rudder.

1004
01:19:58,036 --> 01:20:00,106
Doesn't corner worth a damn.

1005
01:20:00,596 --> 01:20:02,666
Everything he knows is wrong.

1006
01:20:14,876 --> 01:20:18,346
It's quite proper, I assure you.
This is the sitting room.

1007
01:20:20,395 --> 01:20:22,545
- Will this light do?
- What?

1008
01:20:22,875 --> 01:20:25,025
Don't artists need good light?

1009
01:20:25,115 --> 01:20:28,790
That is true, but I'm not used to working
in such horrible conditions.

1010
01:20:29,915 --> 01:20:31,064
Monet!

1011
01:20:32,235 --> 01:20:34,351
- You know his work?
- Of course.

1012
01:20:34,795 --> 01:20:37,184
Look at his use of color here.
Isn't he great?

1013
01:20:37,275 --> 01:20:39,266
I know. It's extraordinary.

1014
01:20:41,395 --> 01:20:44,671
Cal insists on carting
this hideous thing everywhere.

1015
01:20:45,075 --> 01:20:47,714
Should we be expecting him
anytime soon?

1016
01:20:48,395 --> 01:20:51,272
Not as long as the cigars
and brandy hold out.

1017
01:20:54,794 --> 01:20:57,513
That's nice. What is it, a sapphire?

1018
01:20:58,434 --> 01:21:01,392
A diamond. A very rare diamond.

1019
01:21:05,154 --> 01:21:08,669
Jack, I want you to draw me
like one of your French girls.

1020
01:21:09,034 --> 01:21:11,594
- Wearing this.
- All right.

1021
01:21:13,394 --> 01:21:14,986
Wearing only this.

1022
01:21:48,873 --> 01:21:50,545
The last thing I need ...

1023
01:21:50,632 --> 01:21:53,943
is another picture of me
looking like a porcelain doll.

1024
01:21:56,713 --> 01:21:58,623
As a paying customer ...

1025
01:22:00,312 --> 01:22:02,382
I expect to get what I want.

1026
01:22:19,552 --> 01:22:22,066
Over on the bed. The couch.

1027
01:22:30,511 --> 01:22:32,229
Lie down.

1028
01:22:36,071 --> 01:22:39,700
- Tell me when it looks right.
- Put your arm back the way it was.

1029
01:22:41,351 --> 01:22:44,707
Put that other arm up,
that hand right by your face there.

1030
01:22:46,111 --> 01:22:47,260
Right.

1031
01:22:47,871 --> 01:22:49,623
Now, head down.

1032
01:22:51,911 --> 01:22:54,027
Eyes to me, keep them on me.

1033
01:22:56,030 --> 01:22:57,783
And try to stay still.

1034
01:23:15,990 --> 01:23:17,309
So serious.

1035
01:23:57,589 --> 01:24:00,422
I believe you are blushing, 
Mr. Big Artiste.

1036
01:24:04,709 --> 01:24:07,381
I can't imagine 
Monsieur Monet blushing.

1037
01:24:08,588 --> 01:24:10,260
He does landscapes.

1038
01:24:11,108 --> 01:24:13,383
- Just relax your face.
- Sorry.

1039
01:24:13,468 --> 01:24:14,787
No laughing.

1040
01:24:44,507 --> 01:24:47,021
My heart was pounding the whole time.

1041
01:24:47,707 --> 01:24:51,097
It was the most erotic 
moment of my life ...

1042
01:24:54,787 --> 01:24:56,743
up until then, at least.

1043
01:24:57,867 --> 01:24:59,664
So what happened next?

1044
01:25:00,307 --> 01:25:02,775
You mean, did we do it?

1045
01:25:06,466 --> 01:25:08,138
Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Bodine.

1046
01:25:08,227 --> 01:25:10,263
Jack was very professional.

1047
01:25:17,626 --> 01:25:18,945
Thank you.

1048
01:25:26,946 --> 01:25:28,618
What are you doing?

1049
01:25:29,026 --> 01:25:31,779
Will you put this back 
in the safe for me?

1050
01:25:42,985 --> 01:25:45,021
- Gentlemen, would you excuse me?
- Sure.

1051
01:25:47,025 --> 01:25:49,414
None of the stewards have seen her.

1052
01:25:49,905 --> 01:25:52,260
This is absurd. It's a ship.

1053
01:25:52,345 --> 01:25:54,620
There's only so many places 
she could be.

1054
01:25:54,705 --> 01:25:56,297
Lovejoy, find her.

1055
01:26:13,265 --> 01:26:14,697
- Clear.
- Yes.

1056
01:26:15,904 --> 01:26:18,816
I don't think I've ever seen
such a flat calm.

1057
01:26:20,024 --> 01:26:23,175
Like a mill pond. 
Not a breath of wind.

1058
01:26:24,464 --> 01:26:27,103
It will make 
the 'bergs harder to see ...

1059
01:26:27,384 --> 01:26:29,818
with no breaking water at the base.

1060
01:26:40,704 --> 01:26:42,137
Well, I'm off.

1061
01:26:42,224 --> 01:26:44,943
Maintain speed and heading,
Mr. Lightoller.

1062
01:26:45,263 --> 01:26:46,458
Yes, sir.

1063
01:26:57,263 --> 01:26:58,855
It's getting cold.

1064
01:26:59,063 --> 01:27:00,974
- You look nice.
- Miss Rose?

1065
01:27:02,023 --> 01:27:03,342
My drawings.

1066
01:27:28,382 --> 01:27:29,576
Come on, Jack!

1067
01:27:32,982 --> 01:27:34,859
- Wait!
- Wait!

1068
01:27:35,942 --> 01:27:38,058
- Go!
- Take us down, quick.

1069
01:27:38,142 --> 01:27:39,575
- Go!
- Quickly! Quickly!

1070
01:27:44,742 --> 01:27:45,776
Bye.

1071
01:27:53,261 --> 01:27:54,250
Sorry.

1072
01:27:59,581 --> 01:28:01,572
- Keep going.
- Thank you, I've got it.

1073
01:28:11,381 --> 01:28:13,895
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.

1074
01:28:13,981 --> 01:28:16,541
- Seems more like a cop.
- I think he was.

1075
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:18,659
- Oh, shit.
- Go!

1076
01:28:23,181 --> 01:28:25,614
- No, over here!
- Quick!

1077
01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:34,695
- Now what?
- What?

1078
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:43,288
More coal for number one, mate.

1079
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:45,530
What are you two doing down here?

1080
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:47,895
You shouldn't be down here.
It could be dangerous!

1081
01:28:51,579 --> 01:28:53,774
Carry on. Don't mind us.

1082
01:28:53,860 --> 01:28:56,817
You're doing a great job.
Keep up the good work!

1083
01:29:12,019 --> 01:29:14,010
Look at what we have here.

1084
01:29:31,578 --> 01:29:32,806
Thank you.

1085
01:29:43,978 --> 01:29:45,457
Where to, miss?

1086
01:29:46,818 --> 01:29:48,251
To the stars.

1087
01:30:06,497 --> 01:30:07,850
You nervous?

1088
01:30:10,217 --> 01:30:11,252
No.

1089
01:30:27,497 --> 01:30:29,533
Put your hands on me, Jack.

1090
01:30:53,216 --> 01:30:54,729
It's bloody cold.

1091
01:30:54,816 --> 01:30:57,488
You know, I can smell ice, you know.
When it's near.

1092
01:30:59,455 --> 01:31:01,969
- Bollocks!
- Well, I can, all right?

1093
01:31:02,895 --> 01:31:05,125
Did you ever find those binoculars
for the lookouts?

1094
01:31:05,215 --> 01:31:07,649
Haven't seen them since Southampton.

1095
01:31:07,735 --> 01:31:10,124
Well, I'll be on my rounds. Cheerio.

1096
01:31:40,534 --> 01:31:42,126
You're trembling.

1097
01:31:43,974 --> 01:31:46,613
Don't worry, I'll be all right.

1098
01:32:07,733 --> 01:32:10,008
- They ran down there.
- All right.

1099
01:32:18,813 --> 01:32:20,371
Anything missing?

1100
01:32:44,212 --> 01:32:46,123
I've got a better idea.

1101
01:32:58,412 --> 01:32:59,401
Gotcha!

1102
01:33:08,332 --> 01:33:10,447
Did you see those guys' faces?

1103
01:33:11,611 --> 01:33:13,169
Did you see them?

1104
01:33:19,491 --> 01:33:21,322
When the ship docks ...

1105
01:33:22,611 --> 01:33:24,567
I'm getting off with you.

1106
01:33:25,371 --> 01:33:27,248
- This is crazy.
- I know.

1107
01:33:27,331 --> 01:33:29,242
It doesn't make any sense.

1108
01:33:30,731 --> 01:33:32,527
That's why I trust it.

1109
01:33:41,970 --> 01:33:43,642
Here, look at this.

1110
01:33:44,410 --> 01:33:46,241
Look at that, would you?

1111
01:33:46,330 --> 01:33:48,321
They're a bit warmer than we are.

1112
01:33:48,410 --> 01:33:50,844
If that's what it takes for us
to get warm, I'd rather not ...

1113
01:33:50,930 --> 01:33:52,727
if it's all the same to you, all right?

1114
01:34:04,410 --> 01:34:06,241
Bugger me!

1115
01:34:10,889 --> 01:34:12,686
Pick up, you bastards!

1116
01:34:15,849 --> 01:34:18,079
- Is anyone there?
- Yes, what do you see?

1117
01:34:18,169 --> 01:34:20,478
- Iceberg, right ahead!
- Thank you.

1118
01:34:23,009 --> 01:34:24,328
Iceberg, right ahead!

1119
01:34:24,409 --> 01:34:26,081
Hard to starboard!

1120
01:34:32,929 --> 01:34:35,318
Turn! Smartly!

1121
01:34:39,929 --> 01:34:41,282
Full astern!

1122
01:34:43,368 --> 01:34:45,723
- Hard over.
- Helm's hard over, sir.

1123
01:34:49,368 --> 01:34:50,801
Go, lads, go!

1124
01:34:53,448 --> 01:34:55,962
Bring that steam down! 
Bring it down!

1125
01:34:57,848 --> 01:35:00,237
Shut all the dampers! Shut them!

1126
01:35:04,808 --> 01:35:06,036
Hold it.

1127
01:35:10,048 --> 01:35:12,322
Now! Engage the reversing engine.

1128
01:35:39,647 --> 01:35:41,443
Why ain't they turning?

1129
01:35:41,527 --> 01:35:44,404
- Is it hard over?
- It is. Yes, sir, hard over.

1130
01:35:49,446 --> 01:35:52,563
Come on. Come on. Turn.

1131
01:36:03,046 --> 01:36:04,035
Yes.

1132
01:36:09,406 --> 01:36:10,885
It's gonna hit!

1133
01:36:21,885 --> 01:36:23,284
Jesus Christ!

1134
01:36:43,205 --> 01:36:44,558
Jesus.

1135
01:36:44,645 --> 01:36:47,079
- Hard to port!
- Hard to port!

1136
01:36:56,724 --> 01:36:57,918
Get back!

1137
01:37:25,923 --> 01:37:27,356
Come on, let's go!

1138
01:37:27,443 --> 01:37:29,877
Get out of the door.
They're closing the doors!

1139
01:37:29,963 --> 01:37:31,157
Get out!

1140
01:37:37,043 --> 01:37:39,238
Get out of the door! Go!

1141
01:37:40,123 --> 01:37:42,842
Come on, lads! Go, lads, go!

1142
01:37:54,763 --> 01:37:55,797
Out!

1143
01:38:09,882 --> 01:38:11,156
Oh, my God.

1144
01:38:12,482 --> 01:38:14,074
That was a close shave, wasn't it?

1145
01:38:14,162 --> 01:38:16,596
Smell ice, can you? Bleeding Christ!

1146
01:38:20,922 --> 01:38:23,436
Note the time and enter it in the log.

1147
01:38:28,961 --> 01:38:30,997
What was that, Mr. Murdoch?

1148
01:38:31,481 --> 01:38:33,039
An iceberg, sir.

1149
01:38:33,881 --> 01:38:37,635
I put her hard to starboard, and ran the
engines full astern, but it was too close.

1150
01:38:37,721 --> 01:38:39,916
I tried to port round it, but she hit.

1151
01:38:40,001 --> 01:38:43,152
- Close the watertight doors.
- Doors are closed, sir.

1152
01:38:45,841 --> 01:38:47,559
- All stop.
- Aye, sir.

1153
01:38:55,681 --> 01:38:57,672
Find the carpenter.
Get him to sound the ship.

1154
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:58,954
Yes, sir.

1155
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:11,396
Come on, let's get the hell 
out of here.

1156
01:39:11,480 --> 01:39:12,515
Come on, hurry up.

1157
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:19,157
Excuse me,
why have the engines stopped?

1158
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:21,231
- I felt a shudder.
- I shouldn't worry, madam.

1159
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:24,232
We've likely thrown a propeller blade.
That's the shudder you felt.

1160
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:26,117
May I bring you anything?

1161
01:39:26,199 --> 01:39:27,268
No, thank you.

1162
01:39:32,359 --> 01:39:34,634
So, now there's talk of an iceberg.
Did you see anything?

1163
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:36,516
I don't see anything now. Do you?

1164
01:39:38,319 --> 01:39:41,470
If this is the direction the rats 
are going, that's good enough for me.

1165
01:39:44,359 --> 01:39:46,350
Everything's under control.

1166
01:39:48,159 --> 01:39:50,195
- You there.
- Sir, there is no emergency.

1167
01:39:50,279 --> 01:39:51,917
Yes, there is. I've been robbed.

1168
01:39:51,999 --> 01:39:53,478
Get the master-at-arms.

1169
01:39:53,559 --> 01:39:55,436
- Now, you moron!
- Yes, sir.

1170
01:39:58,559 --> 01:40:00,435
Hey, did I miss the fun?

1171
01:40:01,918 --> 01:40:03,874
- Did you see what happened?
- No, I missed it.

1172
01:40:03,959 --> 01:40:06,075
Apparently, it hit over there.

1173
01:40:06,278 --> 01:40:08,838
Boiler Room 6 is flooded
8 feet above the plate ...

1174
01:40:08,918 --> 01:40:10,954
and the mail hold is worse.
She's all buckled in —

1175
01:40:11,038 --> 01:40:13,108
- Can you shore up?
- Not unless the pumps get ahead.

1176
01:40:13,198 --> 01:40:14,870
Have you seen the damage
in the mail hold?

1177
01:40:14,958 --> 01:40:17,074
No, she's already underwater.

1178
01:40:17,158 --> 01:40:18,511
This is bad.

1179
01:40:20,718 --> 01:40:22,390
We should tell Mother and Cal.

1180
01:40:23,478 --> 01:40:25,673
I think they're very good, sir.

1181
01:40:28,238 --> 01:40:31,708
Don't touch anything.
I want the entire room photographed.

1182
01:40:36,077 --> 01:40:38,352
We've been looking for you, miss.

1183
01:40:42,477 --> 01:40:43,546
Here we go.

1184
01:40:49,477 --> 01:40:51,672
Something serious has happened.

1185
01:40:52,237 --> 01:40:53,636
Yes, it has.

1186
01:40:54,957 --> 01:40:55,992
Indeed.

1187
01:40:56,077 --> 01:40:58,386
Two things dear to me
have disappeared this evening.

1188
01:40:58,477 --> 01:41:01,593
Now that one is back, I have a pretty 
good idea where to find the other.

1189
01:41:01,677 --> 01:41:02,711
Search him.

1190
01:41:02,797 --> 01:41:04,388
- Take your coat off, son.
- Now what?

1191
01:41:04,477 --> 01:41:05,704
Come on, now.

1192
01:41:05,796 --> 01:41:07,594
Cal, what are you doing?

1193
01:41:07,676 --> 01:41:09,906
We're in the middle of an emergency.
What's going on?

1194
01:41:09,996 --> 01:41:12,066
- Is this it?
- That's it.

1195
01:41:12,676 --> 01:41:14,268
This is horseshit!

1196
01:41:15,116 --> 01:41:16,868
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't.

1197
01:41:16,956 --> 01:41:18,867
- He couldn't have.
- Of course he could.

1198
01:41:18,956 --> 01:41:20,548
It's easy enough for a professional.

1199
01:41:20,636 --> 01:41:23,275
But I was with him the whole time.
This is absurd.

1200
01:41:23,356 --> 01:41:27,315
Perhaps he did it while you were putting
your clothes back on, dear.

1201
01:41:27,716 --> 01:41:29,866
Real slick, Cal.
Rose, they put it in my pocket.

1202
01:41:29,956 --> 01:41:32,868
- Shut up.
- It isn't even your pocket. Is it, son?

1203
01:41:32,955 --> 01:41:34,947
"Property of A.L. Ryerson."

1204
01:41:38,555 --> 01:41:39,955
That was reported stolen today.

1205
01:41:40,035 --> 01:41:41,866
I just borrowed it. 
I was gonna return it.

1206
01:41:41,955 --> 01:41:44,344
An honest thief.
We have an honest thief here, do we?

1207
01:41:44,435 --> 01:41:47,233
You know I didn't do this, Rose.
You know it.

1208
01:41:47,395 --> 01:41:49,033
Don't believe them, Rose. You know it.

1209
01:41:49,115 --> 01:41:51,948
- You know I didn't do it.
- Come on, son. Let's go.

1210
01:41:52,035 --> 01:41:54,424
- Rose!
- Come on, there's a good lad.

1211
01:41:54,915 --> 01:41:56,030
Come on.

1212
01:41:56,115 --> 01:41:58,310
You know I didn't do it. You know me!

1213
01:41:59,555 --> 01:42:01,511
This is most unfortunate, Captain.

1214
01:42:05,394 --> 01:42:08,466
Water 14 feet above the keel
in 10 minutes ...

1215
01:42:09,154 --> 01:42:12,306
in the forepeak, in all 3 holds,
and in Boiler Room 6.

1216
01:42:12,394 --> 01:42:15,227
- That's right, sir.
- When can we get underway, damn it?

1217
01:42:15,314 --> 01:42:17,270
That's 5 compartments.

1218
01:42:18,914 --> 01:42:21,428
She can stay afloat with the 
first 4 compartments breached ...

1219
01:42:21,514 --> 01:42:22,913
but not 5.

1220
01:42:23,354 --> 01:42:24,548
Not 5.

1221
01:42:24,754 --> 01:42:26,267
As she goes down by the head ...

1222
01:42:26,354 --> 01:42:29,505
the water will spill over the tops 
of the bulkheads at "E" deck ...

1223
01:42:29,834 --> 01:42:32,143
from one to the next, back and back.

1224
01:42:32,314 --> 01:42:34,111
There's no stopping it.

1225
01:42:34,194 --> 01:42:35,513
The pumps. We open the pumps ...

1226
01:42:35,594 --> 01:42:38,267
The pumps buy you time,
but minutes only.

1227
01:42:39,313 --> 01:42:41,589
From this moment,
no matter what we do ...

1228
01:42:42,353 --> 01:42:44,071
Titanic will founder.

1229
01:42:46,673 --> 01:42:48,072
But this ship can't sink.

1230
01:42:48,153 --> 01:42:51,941
She's made of iron, sir.
I assure you, she can. And she will.

1231
01:42:53,033 --> 01:42:54,910
It is a mathematical certainty.

1232
01:42:59,393 --> 01:43:00,826
How much time?

1233
01:43:07,992 --> 01:43:10,188
An hour. Two, at most.

1234
01:43:16,232 --> 01:43:18,541
And how many aboard, Mr. Murdoch?

1235
01:43:18,712 --> 01:43:20,942
2,200 souls on board, sir.

1236
01:43:27,952 --> 01:43:30,910
Well, I believe you may 
get your headlines, Mr. Ismay.

1237
01:43:48,110 --> 01:43:50,340
Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it?

1238
01:43:51,070 --> 01:43:53,061
You look at me 
when I'm talking to you!

1239
01:43:53,230 --> 01:43:55,347
- Mr. Hockley?
- Not now. We're busy.

1240
01:43:55,431 --> 01:43:58,150
Sir, I've been told to ask you
to put on your lifebelts ...

1241
01:43:58,231 --> 01:44:00,222
and come up to the boat deck.
- I said, not now.

1242
01:44:00,311 --> 01:44:03,303
I'm sorry to inconvenience you,
Mr. Hockley, but it's Captain's orders.

1243
01:44:03,391 --> 01:44:05,269
Now please, dress warmly.

1244
01:44:05,552 --> 01:44:07,622
It's quite cold out tonight.

1245
01:44:07,992 --> 01:44:10,506
Now, may I suggest topcoats and hats?

1246
01:44:10,992 --> 01:44:12,664
This is ridiculous.

1247
01:44:13,352 --> 01:44:16,629
Not to worry, miss.
I'm sure it's just a precaution.

1248
01:44:17,073 --> 01:44:18,904
Everybody up. Lifebelts on.

1249
01:44:20,913 --> 01:44:22,631
What's he on about?

1250
01:44:22,713 --> 01:44:24,988
- Everybody up. Put your lifebelts on.
- What's the ruckus?

1251
01:44:25,073 --> 01:44:26,348
Just put your lifebelts on.

1252
01:44:27,794 --> 01:44:28,783
CQD?

1253
01:44:29,474 --> 01:44:30,543
Sir?

1254
01:44:32,074 --> 01:44:34,190
That's right, CQD, the distress call.

1255
01:44:34,674 --> 01:44:35,993
That's our position.

1256
01:44:41,195 --> 01:44:43,663
Tell whoever responds that we're 
going down by the head ...

1257
01:44:43,755 --> 01:44:45,632
and need immediate assistance.

1258
01:44:54,156 --> 01:44:55,350
Blimey.

1259
01:45:05,357 --> 01:45:06,676
Keep lowering!

1260
01:45:12,678 --> 01:45:16,273
Steady! Make it taut! And winch out!

1261
01:45:21,239 --> 01:45:24,390
Uncover this boat!
Uncover all the boats aft!

1262
01:45:24,479 --> 01:45:26,151
Release those ties!

1263
01:45:26,359 --> 01:45:29,112
Roll back that cover! Smartly now!

1264
01:45:29,639 --> 01:45:31,278
Mr. Wilde, where are the passengers?

1265
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:34,636
They've all gone back inside.
Too damn cold and noisy for them.

1266
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:35,755
You there!

1267
01:45:36,720 --> 01:45:38,631
Get down here 
and help with these lines!

1268
01:45:52,562 --> 01:45:54,393
Care for a drink, sir?

1269
01:45:55,482 --> 01:45:56,756
Please put your lifebelts on.

1270
01:45:56,842 --> 01:45:58,514
Sonny, what's doing?

1271
01:45:58,642 --> 01:46:01,440
You got us all trussed up here
and now we're cooling our heels.

1272
01:46:01,522 --> 01:46:03,434
Sorry, ma'am. Let me go find out.

1273
01:46:04,283 --> 01:46:07,036
I don't think anybody knows
what the hell's going on around here.

1274
01:46:07,123 --> 01:46:09,876
It's just the goddamned English,
doing everything by the book.

1275
01:46:09,963 --> 01:46:12,682
There's no need 
for language, Mr. Hockley.

1276
01:46:12,923 --> 01:46:15,199
Go back and turn the heaters on
in our rooms.

1277
01:46:15,284 --> 01:46:17,081
I'd like a cup of tea when I return.

1278
01:46:17,164 --> 01:46:18,961
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

1279
01:46:28,165 --> 01:46:29,644
Mr. Andrews ...

1280
01:46:31,085 --> 01:46:33,997
I saw the iceberg.
And I see it in your eyes.

1281
01:46:34,365 --> 01:46:35,765
Please tell me the truth.

1282
01:46:44,006 --> 01:46:45,679
The ship will sink.

1283
01:46:47,327 --> 01:46:48,919
- You're certain?
- Yes.

1284
01:46:49,207 --> 01:46:50,879
In an hour or so ...

1285
01:46:51,647 --> 01:46:54,719
all this will be
at the bottom of the Atlantic.

1286
01:46:55,407 --> 01:46:56,443
What?

1287
01:46:56,528 --> 01:46:58,484
Please, tell only who you must.

1288
01:46:58,568 --> 01:47:00,718
I don't want to be 
responsible for a panic.

1289
01:47:00,888 --> 01:47:03,448
And get to a boat. 
Quickly. Don't wait.

1290
01:47:04,488 --> 01:47:07,322
You remember
what I told you about the boats?

1291
01:47:09,649 --> 01:47:10,684
Yes.

1292
01:47:12,569 --> 01:47:14,002
I understand.

1293
01:47:18,170 --> 01:47:20,479
Yes, madam, 
please put it on immediately.

1294
01:47:21,690 --> 01:47:23,169
Over here, son.

1295
01:47:24,010 --> 01:47:26,399
Sir, they need you up
at the second-class purser's office.

1296
01:47:26,490 --> 01:47:29,369
- There's a big mob up there.
- Go on. I'll keep an eye on him.

1297
01:47:29,891 --> 01:47:31,244
Aye. Right.

1298
01:47:44,612 --> 01:47:45,681
Sir!

1299
01:47:45,772 --> 01:47:48,127
Carpathia says they're making 17 knots.

1300
01:47:48,212 --> 01:47:50,089
Full steam for them, sir.

1301
01:47:51,373 --> 01:47:52,931
She's the only one who's responding?

1302
01:47:53,013 --> 01:47:54,412
The only one close, sir.

1303
01:47:54,493 --> 01:47:56,609
Says they can be here in 4 hours.

1304
01:47:57,133 --> 01:47:58,452
4 hours!

1305
01:48:03,574 --> 01:48:05,132
Thank you, Bride.

1306
01:48:09,454 --> 01:48:10,603
My God.

1307
01:48:19,855 --> 01:48:22,085
We are swung out and ready, sir.

1308
01:48:23,216 --> 01:48:26,413
Hadn't we better get the women
and children into the boats, sir?

1309
01:48:28,896 --> 01:48:30,011
Yes.

1310
01:48:30,096 --> 01:48:31,131
Sir?

1311
01:48:33,697 --> 01:48:36,894
Women and children first, yes.

1312
01:48:38,257 --> 01:48:39,485
Yes, sir.

1313
01:48:42,297 --> 01:48:45,335
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please!

1314
01:48:45,658 --> 01:48:47,888
Step this way, please. That's right.

1315
01:48:48,058 --> 01:48:50,367
Come towards me. Thank you.

1316
01:48:51,818 --> 01:48:52,887
Good.

1317
01:48:53,058 --> 01:48:56,938
For the time being, I shall 
require only women and children.

1318
01:48:57,219 --> 01:48:59,255
- Gentlemen, please.
- Right here.

1319
01:48:59,339 --> 01:49:02,968
All right, boys. Like the Captain said,
nice and cheery, so there's no panic.

1320
01:49:04,019 --> 01:49:05,578
Wedding Dance.

1321
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:15,655
Lifebelts on. Put your lifebelts on.

1322
01:49:17,181 --> 01:49:18,819
Here, put your lifebelt on.

1323
01:49:18,901 --> 01:49:20,937
Yeah, come on. Put your lifebelt on.

1324
01:49:21,021 --> 01:49:22,579
Turn that around.

1325
01:49:23,621 --> 01:49:24,815
Please.

1326
01:49:26,781 --> 01:49:29,171
It isn't time to go up to the boats yet!

1327
01:49:29,542 --> 01:49:31,021
Please stay calm.

1328
01:49:31,102 --> 01:49:34,777
Make sure, everybody,
you've got your lifebelts on.

1329
01:49:34,862 --> 01:49:37,535
And, gentlemen, allow the women
and children through to the front.

1330
01:49:37,622 --> 01:49:39,932
- What are we doing, Mommy?
- We're just waiting, dear.

1331
01:49:40,023 --> 01:49:42,412
When they finish putting
first-class people in the boats ...

1332
01:49:42,503 --> 01:49:45,540
they will be starting with us
and we'll want to be all ready, won't we?

1333
01:49:45,623 --> 01:49:47,056
Everybody, not just right yet.

1334
01:49:47,143 --> 01:49:48,975
Don't push on the gates.
You won't get out any faster.

1335
01:49:49,064 --> 01:49:50,417
- Someone help.
- Go and get some help.

1336
01:49:50,504 --> 01:49:52,972
Lower it away, left and right together!

1337
01:49:55,144 --> 01:49:57,419
Both sides together! Steady!

1338
01:49:58,224 --> 01:49:59,419
Steady!

1339
01:50:02,465 --> 01:50:03,944
Stop!

1340
01:50:04,945 --> 01:50:06,617
Hold the left side!

1341
01:50:06,705 --> 01:50:08,900
Right side only!

1342
01:50:09,225 --> 01:50:11,535
Right side only. Hold the left side!

1343
01:50:12,906 --> 01:50:14,624
Lower away together!

1344
01:50:16,346 --> 01:50:17,779
Steady, lads!

1345
01:51:03,510 --> 01:51:06,469
You know, 
I do believe this ship may sink.

1346
01:51:08,951 --> 01:51:12,739
I've been asked to give you
this small token of our appreciation.

1347
01:51:15,632 --> 01:51:18,021
Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley.

1348
01:51:24,712 --> 01:51:27,466
Come on, sister. You heard the man.
Into the boat.

1349
01:51:27,833 --> 01:51:29,630
Any room for a gentleman, gentlemen?

1350
01:51:29,713 --> 01:51:31,783
Only women at this time, sir.

1351
01:51:34,153 --> 01:51:36,952
Will the lifeboats be seated
according to class?

1352
01:51:38,354 --> 01:51:40,584
I hope they're not too crowded.

1353
01:51:41,674 --> 01:51:43,904
Oh, Mother, shut up!

1354
01:51:44,394 --> 01:51:45,873
Don't you understand?

1355
01:51:45,954 --> 01:51:48,230
The water is freezing
and there aren't enough boats.

1356
01:51:48,315 --> 01:51:49,953
Not enough by half.

1357
01:51:50,315 --> 01:51:52,545
Half the people on this ship
are going to die.

1358
01:51:52,835 --> 01:51:54,553
Not the better half.

1359
01:51:56,235 --> 01:52:00,070
Come on, Ruth, get in the boat.
First-class seats are right up here.

1360
01:52:00,756 --> 01:52:02,792
You know, it's a pity
I didn't keep that drawing.

1361
01:52:02,876 --> 01:52:04,753
It'll be worth a lot more by morning.

1362
01:52:04,836 --> 01:52:07,794
Women and children
towards the front, please.

1363
01:52:07,876 --> 01:52:10,266
You unimaginable bastard.

1364
01:52:11,197 --> 01:52:13,836
Come on, Rose, darling.
There's plenty of room for you.

1365
01:52:13,917 --> 01:52:15,032
Right this way, miss.

1366
01:52:15,117 --> 01:52:16,516
Come on, Rose.

1367
01:52:16,597 --> 01:52:18,315
You're next, darling.

1368
01:52:18,477 --> 01:52:20,389
Come into the boat, Rose.

1369
01:52:21,518 --> 01:52:22,587
Come.

1370
01:52:23,038 --> 01:52:24,107
Rose?

1371
01:52:25,158 --> 01:52:26,796
Get into the boat.

1372
01:52:27,118 --> 01:52:28,187
Rose?

1373
01:52:29,638 --> 01:52:31,197
Goodbye, Mother.

1374
01:52:32,799 --> 01:52:33,868
Rose?

1375
01:52:34,319 --> 01:52:36,708
- Rose, come back here.
- Where are you going?

1376
01:52:37,199 --> 01:52:38,348
To him?

1377
01:52:38,479 --> 01:52:40,390
What, to be a whore to a gutter rat?

1378
01:52:40,479 --> 01:52:41,469
No, wait.

1379
01:52:41,560 --> 01:52:44,199
I'd rather be his whore 
than your wife.

1380
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:48,189
No!

1381
01:52:48,760 --> 01:52:50,113
I said, no!

1382
01:52:51,801 --> 01:52:53,712
Rose, please stop!

1383
01:52:55,401 --> 01:52:56,959
- Lower away!
- No, stop!

1384
01:52:57,041 --> 01:52:58,679
- All together.
- No, wait!

1385
01:52:58,761 --> 01:53:00,080
Lower away!

1386
01:53:00,241 --> 01:53:01,356
Rose!

1387
01:53:07,522 --> 01:53:08,591
Help!

1388
01:53:09,322 --> 01:53:11,313
Can anybody hear me?

1389
01:53:12,442 --> 01:53:14,320
Hello! Help me!

1390
01:53:24,124 --> 01:53:25,443
Mr. Andrews!

1391
01:53:28,724 --> 01:53:31,284
- Steward, check the starboard corridor.
- Yes, Mr. Andrews.

1392
01:53:31,364 --> 01:53:34,162
Madam, please, put on a lifebelt.
Get to the boat deck immediately.

1393
01:53:34,244 --> 01:53:36,805
Lucy, for God's sake, put on 
a lifebelt and set a good example.

1394
01:53:36,885 --> 01:53:38,113
Yes, sir.

1395
01:53:38,565 --> 01:53:40,760
- Anyone in here?
- Mr. Andrews?

1396
01:53:41,045 --> 01:53:42,080
Thank God.

1397
01:53:42,165 --> 01:53:44,725
Where would the master-at-arms
take someone under arrest?

1398
01:53:45,045 --> 01:53:47,480
- You have to get to a boat right away.
- No!

1399
01:53:47,566 --> 01:53:49,796
I'm doing this with or 
without your help, sir.

1400
01:53:49,886 --> 01:53:51,842
But without will take longer.

1401
01:53:53,126 --> 01:53:55,924
Take the elevator to the very bottom.
Go to the left.

1402
01:53:56,007 --> 01:53:59,556
Down the crewmen's passage, then 
go right and left again at the stairs.

1403
01:53:59,647 --> 01:54:01,080
You'll come to a long corridor.

1404
01:54:05,167 --> 01:54:06,806
This could be bad.

1405
01:54:10,928 --> 01:54:12,122
Oh, shit!

1406
01:54:18,729 --> 01:54:20,481
Excuse me. Thank you.

1407
01:54:21,849 --> 01:54:24,079
- I do not care what you think, sir.
- Lifts are closed.

1408
01:54:24,169 --> 01:54:26,922
I'm sorry, miss, 
but the lifts are closed.

1409
01:54:27,889 --> 01:54:31,360
I'm through being polite, 
God damn it! Now, take me down!

1410
01:54:33,050 --> 01:54:34,165
"E" deck.

1411
01:54:37,610 --> 01:54:38,804
Come on.

1412
01:54:57,612 --> 01:54:59,250
- I'm going back up.
- No.

1413
01:55:04,733 --> 01:55:08,043
Come back! I'm going back up!

1414
01:55:16,374 --> 01:55:17,807
Crew passage.

1415
01:55:39,936 --> 01:55:41,051
Jack!

1416
01:55:53,377 --> 01:55:54,413
Rose!

1417
01:55:55,418 --> 01:55:56,407
Jack!

1418
01:55:56,498 --> 01:55:58,090
Rose, I'm in here!

1419
01:55:59,418 --> 01:56:00,407
Jack!

1420
01:56:01,418 --> 01:56:02,453
- Jack!
- Rose!

1421
01:56:02,538 --> 01:56:05,099
Jack! Jack, I'm sorry.

1422
01:56:05,659 --> 01:56:07,729
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1423
01:56:08,739 --> 01:56:12,254
- That guy, Lovejoy, put it in my pocket.
- I know. I know.

1424
01:56:12,339 --> 01:56:13,488
Listen, Rose ...

1425
01:56:13,579 --> 01:56:15,615
you're gonna have to find 
a spare key, all right?

1426
01:56:15,699 --> 01:56:17,691
Look in that cabinet right there.

1427
01:56:18,020 --> 01:56:20,250
It's a little silver one, Rose.

1428
01:56:21,140 --> 01:56:22,129
Silver.

1429
01:56:22,740 --> 01:56:24,696
These are all brass ones!

1430
01:56:24,940 --> 01:56:26,772
Check right here, Rose.

1431
01:56:30,701 --> 01:56:31,895
Rose ...

1432
01:56:33,061 --> 01:56:35,131
how'd you find out I didn't do it?

1433
01:56:35,301 --> 01:56:38,021
I didn't. 
I just realized I already knew.

1434
01:56:40,542 --> 01:56:41,975
Keep looking.

1435
01:56:50,463 --> 01:56:52,897
No key. There's no key!

1436
01:56:52,983 --> 01:56:54,018
All right, Rose, listen.

1437
01:56:54,103 --> 01:56:56,094
You're gonna have to go 
find some help.

1438
01:56:56,583 --> 01:56:58,096
It'll be all right.

1439
01:57:02,264 --> 01:57:03,936
I'll be right back.

1440
01:57:11,105 --> 01:57:12,823
I'll just wait here!

1441
01:57:25,306 --> 01:57:27,376
Hello? Is there anyone here?

1442
01:57:27,786 --> 01:57:28,901
Hello?

1443
01:57:29,706 --> 01:57:31,777
Is there anybody down here?

1444
01:57:32,427 --> 01:57:34,145
We need help! Hello?

1445
01:57:35,907 --> 01:57:37,101
Damn it.

1446
01:57:42,828 --> 01:57:45,262
Can anybody hear me, please? Hello?

1447
01:57:48,508 --> 01:57:49,736
Oh, thank God.

1448
01:57:49,868 --> 01:57:52,986
Wait, I need your help.
There's a man back here.

1449
01:57:53,309 --> 01:57:54,298
Wait!

1450
01:57:58,309 --> 01:57:59,458
Hello?

1451
01:58:24,391 --> 01:58:25,541
Hello?

1452
01:58:26,352 --> 01:58:27,785
Miss, you shouldn't be here now.

1453
01:58:27,872 --> 01:58:30,306
- I need your help.
- We'll get you topside. This way, quickly.

1454
01:58:30,392 --> 01:58:31,791
There's a man down here. He's trapped.

1455
01:58:31,872 --> 01:58:34,147
- This way. There is no need to panic.
- Please!

1456
01:58:34,232 --> 01:58:36,906
No, I'm not panicking!
You're going the wrong way!

1457
01:58:37,193 --> 01:58:38,911
Let go of me! Listen!

1458
01:58:44,033 --> 01:58:45,625
The hell with you.

1459
01:59:21,557 --> 01:59:22,910
Oh, my God.

1460
02:00:09,361 --> 02:00:10,430
Jack!

1461
02:00:10,921 --> 02:00:11,990
Rose!

1462
02:00:13,082 --> 02:00:14,561
Will this work?

1463
02:00:15,482 --> 02:00:17,712
I guess we'll find out. Come on.

1464
02:00:21,082 --> 02:00:22,151
Wait.

1465
02:00:22,442 --> 02:00:24,399
Try a couple 
of practice swings over there.

1466
02:00:30,123 --> 02:00:33,832
Good. Now try to hit the same 
mark again, Rose. You can do it.

1467
02:00:39,444 --> 02:00:41,196
Okay. That's enough practice.

1468
02:00:41,524 --> 02:00:43,116
Come on, Rose. You can do it.

1469
02:00:43,924 --> 02:00:46,962
Listen, just hit it really hard
and really fast.

1470
02:00:48,885 --> 02:00:50,238
Come on. Wait.

1471
02:00:50,365 --> 02:00:51,957
Open your hands up a little more.

1472
02:00:52,045 --> 02:00:53,114
- Good.
- Like that?

1473
02:00:53,205 --> 02:00:54,354
Right.

1474
02:00:54,605 --> 02:00:56,562
Listen, Rose, I trust you.

1475
02:01:01,366 --> 02:01:02,355
Go.

1476
02:01:08,167 --> 02:01:09,316
You did it!

1477
02:01:09,687 --> 02:01:11,245
Come on, let's go.

1478
02:01:11,367 --> 02:01:13,198
Oh, shit, this is cold!

1479
02:01:21,088 --> 02:01:22,806
This is the way out.

1480
02:01:23,008 --> 02:01:25,476
We have to find another way. 
Come on.

1481
02:01:39,050 --> 02:01:41,484
Now there's something
you don't see every day.

1482
02:02:02,771 --> 02:02:06,047
What's this luggage doing here?
Get rid of it. We need the room.

1483
02:02:06,131 --> 02:02:07,689
Get rid of that! Out!

1484
02:02:08,091 --> 02:02:11,129
Come. Time for her to go, sir. 
Step back.

1485
02:02:11,212 --> 02:02:13,362
- Keep calm. Sit down.
- No.

1486
02:02:13,652 --> 02:02:16,007
- No!
- Make more room.

1487
02:02:17,052 --> 02:02:18,724
That's right. Look sharp.

1488
02:02:19,612 --> 02:02:20,761
Lovejoy.

1489
02:02:20,852 --> 02:02:22,969
She's not on the starboard side, either.

1490
02:02:23,253 --> 02:02:24,402
We're running out of time.

1491
02:02:24,493 --> 02:02:27,530
This strutting martinet
isn't letting any men on at all.

1492
02:02:27,773 --> 02:02:30,241
There's one on the other side
letting men on.

1493
02:02:30,333 --> 02:02:31,766
Then that's our play.

1494
02:02:32,013 --> 02:02:34,653
We'll need some insurance first. 
Come on.

1495
02:02:34,734 --> 02:02:37,407
Come on, this way, please.
All the way down there.

1496
02:02:39,854 --> 02:02:40,923
Here!

1497
02:02:41,694 --> 02:02:43,890
What do you think you're doing?

1498
02:02:43,975 --> 02:02:46,045
You'll have to pay for that, you know.

1499
02:02:46,175 --> 02:02:48,894
- That's White Star Line property.
- Shut up!

1500
02:02:50,535 --> 02:02:54,006
Will you hold the boat a moment?
I just have to run back to my room ...

1501
02:02:54,096 --> 02:02:57,054
- Sit down.
- She's the last.

1502
02:02:57,136 --> 02:03:00,890
Mr. Lightoller, why are the boats 
being launched half-full?

1503
02:03:00,976 --> 02:03:02,648
- Not now, Mr. Andrews.
- There, look.

1504
02:03:02,776 --> 02:03:05,291
20 or so in a boat built for 65?

1505
02:03:05,377 --> 02:03:07,732
And I saw one boat with only 12. 12!

1506
02:03:07,817 --> 02:03:10,536
We weren't sure of the weight,
Mr. Andrews.

1507
02:03:10,617 --> 02:03:12,847
- These boats may buckle.
- Rubbish!

1508
02:03:13,057 --> 02:03:15,618
They were tested in Belfast
with the weight of 70 men.

1509
02:03:15,698 --> 02:03:18,656
Now fill these boats, Mr. Lightoller.
For God's sake, man!

1510
02:03:25,498 --> 02:03:28,297
Please, I need more 
women and children!

1511
02:03:32,939 --> 02:03:35,294
Get back in there! 
This is not an exit.

1512
02:03:35,379 --> 02:03:36,938
Get back in there.

1513
02:03:39,460 --> 02:03:43,135
You can't keep us locked in here
like animals. The ship's bloody sinking.

1514
02:03:43,220 --> 02:03:45,256
Bring forward the women.

1515
02:03:45,340 --> 02:03:47,296
Unlock the gates.

1516
02:03:47,660 --> 02:03:49,299
Women only!

1517
02:04:02,222 --> 02:04:03,735
Lock the gates!

1518
02:04:11,823 --> 02:04:14,860
For God's sake, man, there are
women and children down here!

1519
02:04:14,983 --> 02:04:17,577
Let us up, so we can have a chance!

1520
02:04:17,863 --> 02:04:19,091
Get back!

1521
02:04:22,424 --> 02:04:23,698
- Jack.
- Tommy.

1522
02:04:23,784 --> 02:04:25,581
- Can we get out?
- It's hopeless that way.

1523
02:04:25,664 --> 02:04:27,700
Whatever we do, 
we've got to do it fast.

1524
02:04:27,824 --> 02:04:29,018
Jack!

1525
02:04:29,104 --> 02:04:30,332
Fabrizio.

1526
02:04:30,785 --> 02:04:32,059
The boats are all gone.

1527
02:04:32,145 --> 02:04:34,101
This whole place is flooding.
We've got to get out.

1528
02:04:34,185 --> 02:04:36,062
- There is niente this way.
- All right.

1529
02:04:36,185 --> 02:04:37,857
Let's go this way, 
all right? Come on.

1530
02:04:43,426 --> 02:04:45,701
- I make my own luck.
- So do I.

1531
02:04:53,547 --> 02:04:54,741
Come on!

1532
02:04:55,387 --> 02:04:56,900
No, come on, let's go this way.

1533
02:05:05,828 --> 02:05:07,102
This way.

1534
02:05:07,188 --> 02:05:11,306
Just go back to the main stairwell
and everything will be sorted out there.

1535
02:05:11,388 --> 02:05:12,377
The hell it will.

1536
02:05:12,708 --> 02:05:15,985
It will all get sorted out back there.
Go back to the main stairwell.

1537
02:05:16,109 --> 02:05:18,100
- Open the gate.
- Go back down the main stairwell.

1538
02:05:18,189 --> 02:05:19,178
Open the gate right now.

1539
02:05:19,269 --> 02:05:21,624
Go back down the main stairwell
like I told you!

1540
02:05:23,749 --> 02:05:26,344
God damn it! Son of a bitch!

1541
02:05:26,510 --> 02:05:27,784
Stop that!

1542
02:05:27,950 --> 02:05:29,702
Open the damn gate!

1543
02:05:32,270 --> 02:05:33,464
Fabri, Tommy, give me hand here.

1544
02:05:33,550 --> 02:05:35,701
- Move aside. Move aside!
- Pull!

1545
02:05:36,791 --> 02:05:37,860
Pull!

1546
02:05:38,591 --> 02:05:40,741
- Move aside.
- Put that down!

1547
02:05:40,831 --> 02:05:42,469
- Move aside!
- Put that down!

1548
02:05:42,551 --> 02:05:44,587
- One! Two!
- Stop that!

1549
02:05:44,791 --> 02:05:45,780
Three!

1550
02:05:47,912 --> 02:05:48,901
Again!

1551
02:05:51,032 --> 02:05:52,260
Let's go!

1552
02:05:54,192 --> 02:05:55,227
Let's go, Rose.

1553
02:05:55,312 --> 02:05:57,508
You can't go up there! 
You can't do this!

1554
02:06:03,913 --> 02:06:05,585
Keep order here!

1555
02:06:05,673 --> 02:06:07,790
Get back. Get back!

1556
02:06:12,674 --> 02:06:14,153
Hold on to her!

1557
02:06:15,114 --> 02:06:16,263
Pull her in.

1558
02:06:16,914 --> 02:06:18,985
Get back, I say ...

1559
02:06:19,195 --> 02:06:21,663
or I'll shoot you all like dogs!

1560
02:06:21,755 --> 02:06:22,983
Keep order here!

1561
02:06:24,555 --> 02:06:26,068
Keep order, I say.

1562
02:06:27,635 --> 02:06:29,513
Mr. Lowe, man this boat.

1563
02:06:33,756 --> 02:06:34,825
Right.

1564
02:06:34,916 --> 02:06:37,669
Is everybody all right? Nobody panic.

1565
02:06:43,757 --> 02:06:44,985
Stay back!

1566
02:06:45,677 --> 02:06:46,826
We're too late.

1567
02:06:46,917 --> 02:06:48,794
There are more boats down the front.

1568
02:06:48,877 --> 02:06:51,915
Stay with this one. Murdoch.
He seems to be quite practical.

1569
02:06:53,838 --> 02:06:55,317
Stop lowering!

1570
02:06:56,438 --> 02:06:57,666
Stop lowering!

1571
02:06:57,998 --> 02:06:59,317
Cut the falls!

1572
02:07:05,999 --> 02:07:07,318
Sit down!

1573
02:07:08,359 --> 02:07:10,748
Stay back, you lot! Just stay back!

1574
02:07:10,959 --> 02:07:13,394
Stay back, the lot of you! 
Just stay back!

1575
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:18,480
It's starting to fall apart.
We don't have much time.

1576
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:21,114
Mr. Murdoch?

1577
02:07:21,240 --> 02:07:23,914
Mr. Hockley. You two, with me, now!

1578
02:07:24,241 --> 02:07:27,438
I'm a businessman, as you know,
I have a business proposition for you.

1579
02:07:34,842 --> 02:07:35,991
Come on, Rose.

1580
02:07:39,282 --> 02:07:41,034
The boats are gone!

1581
02:07:45,683 --> 02:07:47,275
Colonel, are there any boats 
on that side?

1582
02:07:47,363 --> 02:07:49,752
No, miss, but there are a couple 
of boats all the way forward.

1583
02:07:49,843 --> 02:07:51,401
This way, I'll lead you.

1584
02:07:57,404 --> 02:08:00,077
What's the use?
Nobody's listening to us anyway.

1585
02:08:00,604 --> 02:08:04,392
They don't listen to us at dinner, either.
Come on, let's play. Keep us warm.

1586
02:08:05,764 --> 02:08:06,880
Orpheus.

1587
02:08:11,645 --> 02:08:14,478
Music to drown by.
Now I know I'm in first class.

1588
02:08:19,526 --> 02:08:22,484
- Where is everyone?
- They're all still aft, sir.

1589
02:08:22,686 --> 02:08:24,165
Come on, madam, don't cry.

1590
02:08:24,886 --> 02:08:27,081
We have an understanding, 
then, Mr. Murdoch.

1591
02:08:37,767 --> 02:08:41,556
Will the men please hold back?
Hold back, I say!

1592
02:08:44,128 --> 02:08:47,677
Women and children only! Get back!

1593
02:08:48,128 --> 02:08:50,199
I said, step back, sir.
Come through, madam.

1594
02:08:50,289 --> 02:08:52,086
This way. Step back, sir!

1595
02:08:52,169 --> 02:08:53,158
Let the women —

1596
02:08:53,249 --> 02:08:55,285
You better check the other side. Go!

1597
02:09:02,810 --> 02:09:06,325
I found her, on the other side.
Waiting for a boat ...

1598
02:09:06,970 --> 02:09:08,119
with him.

1599
02:09:09,290 --> 02:09:11,930
- Any more women and children?
- They're all aboard, Mr. Murdoch.

1600
02:09:12,011 --> 02:09:13,524
Anyone else then?

1601
02:09:14,491 --> 02:09:15,844
- Hop on, sir.
- Anyone else?

1602
02:09:15,931 --> 02:09:17,762
Do hurry. Hurry along.

1603
02:09:20,971 --> 02:09:22,325
Stand by the falls.

1604
02:09:22,412 --> 02:09:24,209
God damn it all to hell.

1605
02:09:26,692 --> 02:09:27,727
Shit.

1606
02:09:27,812 --> 02:09:28,801
Fire!

1607
02:09:29,932 --> 02:09:32,128
Sir, you can't go through here.

1608
02:09:32,493 --> 02:09:34,290
Sir, you can't go through.

1609
02:09:36,053 --> 02:09:38,009
That's it. Splendid. Right.

1610
02:09:42,213 --> 02:09:43,567
Prepare to lower!

1611
02:09:45,814 --> 02:09:47,406
Ready on the left!

1612
02:09:53,254 --> 02:09:54,574
Take them down.

1613
02:09:59,415 --> 02:10:00,689
Keep it steady.

1614
02:10:03,135 --> 02:10:06,446
Both sides together.
Steady. Keep it steady.

1615
02:10:07,976 --> 02:10:10,046
- Give her to me.
- Daddy.

1616
02:10:10,336 --> 02:10:12,896
- It'll be fine, darling. Don't you worry.
- Take her.

1617
02:10:12,976 --> 02:10:14,694
Daddy, get in the boat.

1618
02:10:14,776 --> 02:10:18,087
It's goodbye for a little while.
Only for a little while.

1619
02:10:18,177 --> 02:10:19,815
There'll be another 
boat for the daddies ...

1620
02:10:19,897 --> 02:10:21,569
this boat's for the mommies
and the children.

1621
02:10:21,657 --> 02:10:24,410
You hold Mommy's hand
and be a good little girl.

1622
02:10:25,097 --> 02:10:26,292
I'm not going without you.

1623
02:10:26,378 --> 02:10:28,687
- No. You have to go, now.
- No, Jack.

1624
02:10:29,018 --> 02:10:30,576
Get in the boat, Rose.

1625
02:10:30,658 --> 02:10:31,647
No, Jack.

1626
02:10:31,738 --> 02:10:33,456
Yes. Get on the boat.

1627
02:10:33,658 --> 02:10:35,535
Yes, get on the boat, Rose.

1628
02:10:38,619 --> 02:10:41,258
My God. Look at you. 
You look a fright.

1629
02:10:41,779 --> 02:10:42,814
Here.

1630
02:10:44,419 --> 02:10:46,455
Put this on. Come on.

1631
02:10:51,780 --> 02:10:53,611
Go on. I'll get the next one.

1632
02:10:53,700 --> 02:10:55,577
No, not without you.

1633
02:10:55,660 --> 02:10:57,616
I'll be all right. 
Listen, I'll be fine.

1634
02:10:57,700 --> 02:10:59,737
I'm a survivor, all right?
Don't worry about me.

1635
02:10:59,821 --> 02:11:01,015
Now, go on. Get on.

1636
02:11:01,101 --> 02:11:03,740
I have an arrangement with an officer
on the other side of the ship.

1637
02:11:03,821 --> 02:11:06,210
Jack and I can get off safely. 
Both of us.

1638
02:11:07,661 --> 02:11:09,857
See? I got my own boat to catch.

1639
02:11:09,942 --> 02:11:12,502
- Go.
- Come on, hurry. They're almost full.

1640
02:11:13,782 --> 02:11:14,817
Step aboard, miss.

1641
02:11:14,902 --> 02:11:16,255
- Go.
- Come on, hurry.

1642
02:11:17,062 --> 02:11:19,098
- Step aboard, please.
- You're Daddy's good girl.

1643
02:11:19,182 --> 02:11:21,333
- Step lively!
- Keep back.

1644
02:11:21,463 --> 02:11:23,101
Keep back, I say.

1645
02:11:24,863 --> 02:11:26,581
Clear the rail, please.

1646
02:11:27,583 --> 02:11:28,857
Lower away!

1647
02:11:32,424 --> 02:11:33,652
Steady.

1648
02:11:36,464 --> 02:11:38,534
And lower away evenly, lads.

1649
02:11:39,264 --> 02:11:40,253
Easy.

1650
02:11:40,704 --> 02:11:41,933
Lower away.

1651
02:11:42,025 --> 02:11:43,743
You're a good liar.

1652
02:11:43,905 --> 02:11:45,133
Almost as good as you.

1653
02:11:45,225 --> 02:11:47,898
Easy, now. And lower away.

1654
02:11:50,185 --> 02:11:53,258
There's no ... 
There's no arrangement, is there?

1655
02:11:54,906 --> 02:11:56,419
No, there is.

1656
02:11:56,626 --> 02:11:58,776
Not that you'll benefit much from it.

1657
02:11:58,866 --> 02:12:00,060
And even away.

1658
02:12:00,466 --> 02:12:01,455
I always win, Jack.

1659
02:12:01,546 --> 02:12:03,344
And lower away evenly, lads.

1660
02:12:03,427 --> 02:12:04,496
One way or another.

1661
02:12:04,587 --> 02:12:07,260
Watch that trim. Trim that boat.

1662
02:12:08,347 --> 02:12:09,336
Easy.

1663
02:12:10,307 --> 02:12:11,581
Even, lads.

1664
02:12:12,187 --> 02:12:14,816
Keep going!

1665
02:13:00,512 --> 02:13:01,581
Rose!

1666
02:13:03,752 --> 02:13:05,151
- Stop her!
- Rose!

1667
02:13:05,472 --> 02:13:07,384
- What are you doing?
- Stop her!

1668
02:13:08,353 --> 02:13:09,388
No!

1669
02:13:26,954 --> 02:13:28,069
Rose!

1670
02:13:31,355 --> 02:13:34,028
You're so stupid! 
Why did you do that?

1671
02:13:34,435 --> 02:13:36,107
You're so stupid, Rose.

1672
02:13:37,835 --> 02:13:39,747
Why did you do that? Why?

1673
02:13:40,316 --> 02:13:42,193
You jump, I jump, right?

1674
02:13:44,276 --> 02:13:45,311
Right.

1675
02:13:47,356 --> 02:13:48,505
Oh, God.

1676
02:13:48,596 --> 02:13:50,986
I couldn't go. I couldn't go, Jack.

1677
02:13:51,557 --> 02:13:53,912
It's all right. 
We'll think of something.

1678
02:13:54,797 --> 02:13:56,833
At least I'm with you.

1679
02:14:09,918 --> 02:14:11,237
Come on! Move!

1680
02:14:12,239 --> 02:14:13,467
Come on!

1681
02:14:14,319 --> 02:14:15,911
Come on! Move!

1682
02:14:21,999 --> 02:14:23,149
Come on!

1683
02:14:30,680 --> 02:14:31,715
Move!

1684
02:14:37,641 --> 02:14:39,040
Come on, come on, Rose!

1685
02:14:41,361 --> 02:14:42,760
Rose, come on!

1686
02:14:45,442 --> 02:14:46,511
Move, Rose!

1687
02:14:49,522 --> 02:14:50,557
Go!

1688
02:15:00,483 --> 02:15:02,633
I hope you enjoy your time together!

1689
02:15:16,605 --> 02:15:18,402
What could possibly be funny?

1690
02:15:19,285 --> 02:15:21,435
I put the diamond in the coat.

1691
02:15:24,325 --> 02:15:26,316
And I put the coat on her!

1692
02:15:27,846 --> 02:15:29,040
Come on.

1693
02:15:47,367 --> 02:15:49,040
Dada!

1694
02:15:52,088 --> 02:15:53,487
We can't leave him.

1695
02:15:57,488 --> 02:15:58,921
All right, come on!

1696
02:16:00,609 --> 02:16:02,440
Dada!

1697
02:16:14,810 --> 02:16:15,879
Go back!

1698
02:16:26,411 --> 02:16:28,606
That's the wrong way! Come back!

1699
02:16:35,092 --> 02:16:36,081
Go!

1700
02:16:38,412 --> 02:16:39,447
Go!

1701
02:16:40,332 --> 02:16:41,685
Run, Rose!

1702
02:16:48,813 --> 02:16:49,802
Jack!

1703
02:16:53,013 --> 02:16:54,447
- Jack!
- Rose!

1704
02:17:06,735 --> 02:17:07,804
This way!

1705
02:17:16,816 --> 02:17:17,805
Come on!

1706
02:17:19,136 --> 02:17:20,455
Give me your hand!

1707
02:17:28,897 --> 02:17:30,216
Oh, God!

1708
02:17:34,537 --> 02:17:35,572
Help!

1709
02:17:41,098 --> 02:17:42,213
Help!

1710
02:17:44,138 --> 02:17:46,447
Wait, sir! Sir, 
open the gate, please!

1711
02:17:46,538 --> 02:17:48,928
- Please!
- Please, help us!

1712
02:17:49,179 --> 02:17:50,692
- Please!
- Please!

1713
02:17:51,899 --> 02:17:53,048
Bloody hell!

1714
02:17:56,299 --> 02:17:57,288
Hurry.

1715
02:17:58,700 --> 02:18:00,452
- Come on, come on!
- Come on!

1716
02:18:00,980 --> 02:18:02,129
Go, go!

1717
02:18:02,220 --> 02:18:03,289
Jesus.

1718
02:18:04,100 --> 02:18:05,419
- Please!
- Come on!

1719
02:18:05,740 --> 02:18:06,729
Hurry!

1720
02:18:07,100 --> 02:18:08,135
Come on!

1721
02:18:13,261 --> 02:18:14,933
I'm sorry, I dropped the keys.

1722
02:18:15,661 --> 02:18:16,935
- Wait, please!
- Wait!

1723
02:18:18,221 --> 02:18:21,055
Don't leave! Please, send for help!

1724
02:18:38,743 --> 02:18:40,814
I got it! Which one is it, Rose?

1725
02:18:41,104 --> 02:18:42,981
The short one. Try the short one.

1726
02:18:43,944 --> 02:18:45,218
Hurry, Jack.

1727
02:18:48,304 --> 02:18:50,295
Oh, no! No, it won't go in.

1728
02:18:50,544 --> 02:18:51,773
Hurry, Jack.

1729
02:18:54,305 --> 02:18:56,296
It's stuck! It's stuck!

1730
02:18:57,105 --> 02:18:59,016
- Come on!
- Hurry, Jack!

1731
02:19:00,305 --> 02:19:01,784
Hurry, Jack!

1732
02:19:04,466 --> 02:19:06,741
I got it! Go, Rose!

1733
02:19:07,626 --> 02:19:09,059
Go!

1734
02:19:18,747 --> 02:19:20,021
Jack!

1735
02:19:21,987 --> 02:19:23,386
Come on!

1736
02:19:24,708 --> 02:19:25,982
Move, move.

1737
02:19:35,669 --> 02:19:38,706
- Get those oars in place.
- Get an oar under it.

1738
02:19:39,429 --> 02:19:41,624
Women and children only, damn you!

1739
02:19:42,429 --> 02:19:44,989
Hold it!

1740
02:19:55,230 --> 02:19:59,144
Get these davits cranked in!
Let's get the falls hooked up!

1741
02:20:07,952 --> 02:20:09,180
Stay back!

1742
02:20:10,992 --> 02:20:12,311
Mommy!

1743
02:20:12,912 --> 02:20:14,504
Stay back, sir!

1744
02:20:15,912 --> 02:20:17,551
Stay back, I say.

1745
02:20:18,993 --> 02:20:20,426
Keep going up!

1746
02:20:23,193 --> 02:20:24,751
Stop pushing!

1747
02:20:25,713 --> 02:20:27,704
Stay back!

1748
02:20:27,793 --> 02:20:30,467
Will you give us a chance to live,
you limey bastard?

1749
02:20:30,554 --> 02:20:33,273
I'll shoot any man who tries 
to get past me! Get back!

1750
02:20:33,354 --> 02:20:34,423
Bastard!

1751
02:20:34,514 --> 02:20:35,788
Get back!

1752
02:20:36,434 --> 02:20:38,345
We had a deal, damn it!

1753
02:20:40,675 --> 02:20:44,554
Your money can't save you anymore
than it can save me. Get back!

1754
02:20:45,755 --> 02:20:47,473
Women and children only!

1755
02:20:49,876 --> 02:20:51,150
Stop pushing!

1756
02:20:53,276 --> 02:20:54,550
No, Tommy!

1757
02:20:55,076 --> 02:20:56,828
No! No, Tommy!

1758
02:20:57,516 --> 02:20:58,744
Bastardo!

1759
02:21:15,678 --> 02:21:16,906
No, Will!

1760
02:21:23,399 --> 02:21:24,388
Now stand back, damn you!

1761
02:21:28,199 --> 02:21:30,508
Gently, hold it.

1762
02:21:40,560 --> 02:21:42,152
I have a child!

1763
02:21:43,240 --> 02:21:44,833
Clear a path!

1764
02:21:44,921 --> 02:21:46,832
Please, I have a child.

1765
02:21:47,561 --> 02:21:50,029
Please, I'm all she has in the world.

1766
02:21:50,841 --> 02:21:51,876
Go on.

1767
02:21:52,241 --> 02:21:53,674
Step back!

1768
02:21:53,761 --> 02:21:54,751
Please!

1769
02:21:54,842 --> 02:21:56,798
Here. Give her to me.

1770
02:22:02,562 --> 02:22:04,280
There, there.

1771
02:22:08,083 --> 02:22:10,472
Wait! Mr. Andrews.

1772
02:22:12,963 --> 02:22:14,191
Oh, Rose.

1773
02:22:16,724 --> 02:22:18,954
Won't you even make a try for it?

1774
02:22:20,164 --> 02:22:23,918
I'm sorry that I didn't build you
a stronger ship, young Rose.

1775
02:22:26,524 --> 02:22:28,516
It's going fast. We have to move.

1776
02:22:28,605 --> 02:22:29,640
Wait.

1777
02:22:32,645 --> 02:22:34,476
Good luck to you, Rose.

1778
02:22:35,925 --> 02:22:37,199
And to you.

1779
02:22:49,087 --> 02:22:51,806
Mr. Guggenheim? These are for you.

1780
02:22:51,887 --> 02:22:54,401
No, thank you.
We are dressed in our best ...

1781
02:22:54,487 --> 02:22:57,081
and are prepared to go down
as gentlemen.

1782
02:22:57,847 --> 02:22:59,486
But we would like a brandy.

1783
02:23:00,208 --> 02:23:02,085
Get the falls over here now!

1784
02:23:02,808 --> 02:23:05,242
Make them taut. Then we'll right it!

1785
02:23:11,609 --> 02:23:14,601
Capitain, Capitain, 
where should I go? Please.

1786
02:23:20,410 --> 02:23:22,970
Captain. Sir.

1787
02:23:52,773 --> 02:23:54,650
Right. That's it, then.

1788
02:23:55,653 --> 02:23:57,689
Goodbye, Wally, good luck.

1789
02:23:58,013 --> 02:24:00,527
- Goodbye, Wallace.
- So long, old chap.

1790
02:25:11,460 --> 02:25:15,089
And so they lived happily 
together for 300 years ...

1791
02:25:16,180 --> 02:25:18,614
in the land of "Tir na nÓg" ...

1792
02:25:18,901 --> 02:25:21,210
land of eternal youth and beauty.

1793
02:25:55,664 --> 02:25:58,417
There's no time! Cut the falls!

1794
02:25:58,504 --> 02:26:00,859
Cut them if you have to!

1795
02:26:01,464 --> 02:26:03,695
I need a knife!

1796
02:26:05,225 --> 02:26:08,615
Cut the falls now! Cut them loose!

1797
02:26:19,426 --> 02:26:21,223
Cut those bloody falls!

1798
02:27:06,751 --> 02:27:10,426
Gentlemen, it has been a privilege
playing with you tonight.

1799
02:28:08,956 --> 02:28:10,993
We have to stay on the ship
as long as possible.

1800
02:28:11,077 --> 02:28:12,271
Come on.

1801
02:28:23,718 --> 02:28:25,629
This way. Hold the rail.

1802
02:28:27,438 --> 02:28:29,633
Come on, Rose. Jump.

1803
02:28:32,078 --> 02:28:33,228
Come on.

1804
02:29:05,322 --> 02:29:06,960
I got you. Jump!

1805
02:29:09,402 --> 02:29:11,120
I've got you, miss.

1806
02:29:11,562 --> 02:29:12,961
- Jack!
- What?

1807
02:29:14,762 --> 02:29:15,798
Back!

1808
02:29:44,725 --> 02:29:46,397
No, you'll swamp us!

1809
02:29:54,406 --> 02:29:55,680
Nobody panic.

1810
02:29:58,887 --> 02:30:01,959
Yea, though I walk through the 
valley of the shadow of death —

1811
02:30:02,047 --> 02:30:04,720
You want to walk a little faster
through that valley, there?

1812
02:30:52,692 --> 02:30:55,160
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us, sinners ...

1813
02:30:55,252 --> 02:30:57,561
now and at the hour 
of our death. Amen.

1814
02:30:57,652 --> 02:30:59,085
Hail Mary, full of grace ...

1815
02:30:59,172 --> 02:31:00,366
This way.

1816
02:31:10,973 --> 02:31:12,372
Come on!

1817
02:31:21,334 --> 02:31:23,564
And I saw a new heaven 
and a new Earth.

1818
02:31:23,654 --> 02:31:26,965
For the first heaven and the 
first Earth had passed away ...

1819
02:31:28,255 --> 02:31:30,246
and there was no more sea.

1820
02:31:35,856 --> 02:31:38,893
It'll be over soon. 
It'll all be over soon.

1821
02:31:44,576 --> 02:31:46,169
And he shall dwell with them ...

1822
02:31:46,257 --> 02:31:47,975
and they shall be his people ...

1823
02:31:48,057 --> 02:31:51,493
and God himself shall be with them
and be their God.

1824
02:31:52,617 --> 02:31:53,811
Jack ...

1825
02:31:54,617 --> 02:31:56,096
this is where we first met.

1826
02:32:03,178 --> 02:32:06,488
And God shall wipe away
all the tears from their eyes ...

1827
02:32:06,578 --> 02:32:08,854
and there shall be no more death ...

1828
02:32:09,419 --> 02:32:11,933
neither shall there 
be sorrow or crying ...

1829
02:32:12,019 --> 02:32:14,487
neither shall there 
be any more pain ...

1830
02:32:14,859 --> 02:32:17,327
for the former world has passed away.

1831
02:32:31,621 --> 02:32:33,816
Bloody pull faster! And pull!

1832
02:32:56,223 --> 02:32:57,656
Hang on, Miss Trudy!

1833
02:33:31,906 --> 02:33:33,544
Hold on real tight.

1834
02:33:50,428 --> 02:33:51,827
God almighty!

1835
02:33:59,029 --> 02:34:01,384
Keep those breakers in! Keep them in!

1836
02:35:17,396 --> 02:35:18,954
We have to move!

1837
02:35:24,157 --> 02:35:26,034
Give me your hand, I'll pull you over.

1838
02:35:26,357 --> 02:35:28,348
Come on, give me your hand.

1839
02:35:30,597 --> 02:35:32,714
I've got you. I won't let go.

1840
02:35:32,798 --> 02:35:33,787
Come on, I've got you.

1841
02:35:44,879 --> 02:35:47,393
- What's happening, Jack?
- I don't know.

1842
02:35:56,560 --> 02:35:58,118
- Hold on!
- Jack!

1843
02:36:01,120 --> 02:36:03,270
Somebody help me, please!

1844
02:36:38,324 --> 02:36:39,643
This is it!

1845
02:36:51,245 --> 02:36:53,475
Oh, my God, Jack!

1846
02:36:54,605 --> 02:36:55,799
Hold on!

1847
02:37:10,327 --> 02:37:12,557
The ship is gonna suck us down.

1848
02:37:12,847 --> 02:37:14,439
Take a deep breath when I say.

1849
02:37:19,888 --> 02:37:22,243
Kick for the surface and keep kicking.

1850
02:37:22,328 --> 02:37:23,807
Do not let go of my hand.

1851
02:37:30,809 --> 02:37:33,277
We're going to make it, Rose. Trust me.

1852
02:37:33,369 --> 02:37:34,688
I trust you.

1853
02:37:39,168 --> 02:37:42,400
Ready? Now!

1854
02:38:17,692 --> 02:38:19,444
Jack!

1855
02:38:23,212 --> 02:38:24,566
- Rose!
- Jack!

1856
02:38:29,013 --> 02:38:30,002
Jack!

1857
02:38:49,855 --> 02:38:51,447
Jack!

1858
02:39:02,056 --> 02:39:03,569
Get off her!

1859
02:39:07,136 --> 02:39:08,286
- Rose!
- Jack!

1860
02:39:08,377 --> 02:39:10,607
Swim, Rose! I need you to swim!

1861
02:39:14,337 --> 02:39:15,770
Keep swimming.

1862
02:39:19,498 --> 02:39:21,728
- It's so cold.
- Swim, Rose!

1863
02:39:26,978 --> 02:39:28,697
Come on. Here.

1864
02:39:30,059 --> 02:39:32,209
Keep swimming. Come on.

1865
02:39:34,499 --> 02:39:36,091
Here, get on it.

1866
02:39:37,379 --> 02:39:38,812
Get on top.

1867
02:39:45,980 --> 02:39:47,413
Come on, Rose.

1868
02:39:56,421 --> 02:39:58,332
Stay on it. Stay on, Rose.

1869
02:40:18,983 --> 02:40:20,814
It'll be all right now.

1870
02:40:22,864 --> 02:40:24,582
You'll be all right now.

1871
02:40:31,544 --> 02:40:34,423
Return the boats!

1872
02:40:38,265 --> 02:40:40,654
The boats are coming 
back for us, Rose.

1873
02:40:40,945 --> 02:40:43,061
Hold on just a little bit longer.

1874
02:40:43,145 --> 02:40:45,706
They had to row away 
for the suction ...

1875
02:40:46,946 --> 02:40:49,141
but now they'll be coming back.

1876
02:40:50,746 --> 02:40:52,065
For God's sake!

1877
02:40:52,146 --> 02:40:55,139
Please help us!

1878
02:41:00,267 --> 02:41:01,985
You don't understand.

1879
02:41:02,667 --> 02:41:06,786
If we go back, they'll swamp the boat.
They'll pull us right down, I'm telling you.

1880
02:41:06,868 --> 02:41:09,223
Knock it off. You're scaring me.

1881
02:41:09,548 --> 02:41:12,142
Come on, girls, grab an oar. Let's go.

1882
02:41:12,228 --> 02:41:15,504
Are you out of your mind? We're in 
the middle of the North Atlantic.

1883
02:41:15,588 --> 02:41:18,865
Now, do you people want to live
or do you want to die?

1884
02:41:25,309 --> 02:41:27,540
I don't understand a one of you.

1885
02:41:29,230 --> 02:41:32,427
What's the matter with you?
It's your men out there!

1886
02:41:35,110 --> 02:41:36,748
There's plenty of room for more.

1887
02:41:36,830 --> 02:41:38,662
And there'll be one less on this boat.

1888
02:41:38,751 --> 02:41:41,470
If you don't shut 
that hole in your face!

1889
02:41:56,952 --> 02:41:58,908
Bring in your oars over there.

1890
02:41:58,992 --> 02:42:01,507
Tie these two boats together as well.

1891
02:42:05,193 --> 02:42:07,912
Now, make sure that's tied up
nice and tight.

1892
02:42:11,114 --> 02:42:13,503
Right, listen to me, men.
We have to go back.

1893
02:42:13,594 --> 02:42:17,109
I want to transfer all the women
from this boat into that boat right now.

1894
02:42:17,194 --> 02:42:18,513
As quick as you can, please.

1895
02:42:18,594 --> 02:42:21,063
Let's create some space over there.
Move forward and out.

1896
02:42:30,435 --> 02:42:32,108
It's getting quiet.

1897
02:42:34,396 --> 02:42:39,106
It's just going to take a couple of 
minutes to get the boats organized.

1898
02:42:42,597 --> 02:42:44,428
I don't know about you ...

1899
02:42:44,517 --> 02:42:48,271
but I intend to write
a strongly-worded letter ...

1900
02:42:48,357 --> 02:42:50,825
to the White Star Line about all this.

1901
02:42:57,718 --> 02:42:59,310
I love you, Jack.

1902
02:43:05,719 --> 02:43:07,311
Don't you do that.

1903
02:43:08,599 --> 02:43:10,715
Don't you say your goodbyes.

1904
02:43:11,159 --> 02:43:13,275
Not yet. Do you understand me?

1905
02:43:13,879 --> 02:43:15,233
I'm so cold.

1906
02:43:16,120 --> 02:43:17,553
Listen, Rose ...

1907
02:43:18,640 --> 02:43:20,517
you're gonna get out of here.

1908
02:43:21,280 --> 02:43:22,998
You're gonna go on ...

1909
02:43:23,480 --> 02:43:26,075
and you're gonna make lots of babies.

1910
02:43:26,521 --> 02:43:28,637
And you're gonna watch them grow.

1911
02:43:29,881 --> 02:43:33,840
You're gonna die an old lady,
warm in her bed.

1912
02:43:36,041 --> 02:43:37,236
Not here.

1913
02:43:37,802 --> 02:43:39,281
Not this night.

1914
02:43:39,682 --> 02:43:42,116
Not like this. 
Do you understand me?

1915
02:43:44,962 --> 02:43:46,680
I can't feel my body.

1916
02:43:48,803 --> 02:43:52,591
Winning that ticket was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1917
02:43:54,403 --> 02:43:56,121
It brought me to you.

1918
02:43:57,764 --> 02:43:59,994
And I'm thankful for that, Rose.

1919
02:44:00,684 --> 02:44:02,083
I'm thankful.

1920
02:44:04,124 --> 02:44:06,513
You must ...

1921
02:44:07,644 --> 02:44:09,203
do me this honor.

1922
02:44:12,245 --> 02:44:15,043
You must promise me that you'll survive.

1923
02:44:16,485 --> 02:44:18,794
That you won't give up ...

1924
02:44:20,086 --> 02:44:21,963
no matter what happens.

1925
02:44:24,406 --> 02:44:26,362
No matter how hopeless.

1926
02:44:29,967 --> 02:44:31,685
Promise me now, Rose.

1927
02:44:34,127 --> 02:44:36,436
And never let go of that promise.

1928
02:44:37,767 --> 02:44:39,041
I promise.

1929
02:44:41,288 --> 02:44:42,721
Never let go.

1930
02:44:45,528 --> 02:44:47,439
I'll never let go, Jack.

1931
02:44:50,248 --> 02:44:51,841
I'll never let go.

1932
02:45:15,011 --> 02:45:16,603
Right ahead, sir.

1933
02:45:19,571 --> 02:45:20,606
Oars!

1934
02:45:21,331 --> 02:45:23,128
Do you see any moving?

1935
02:45:24,012 --> 02:45:25,923
No, sir. None moving, sir.

1936
02:45:26,452 --> 02:45:27,771
Check them.

1937
02:45:28,092 --> 02:45:29,923
Bring that oar up here.

1938
02:45:35,733 --> 02:45:37,564
Check them. Make sure.

1939
02:45:37,933 --> 02:45:39,685
These are dead, sir.

1940
02:45:40,173 --> 02:45:42,448
Now give way. Ahead easy.

1941
02:45:49,174 --> 02:45:51,847
Careful with your oars. 
Don't hit them.

1942
02:45:54,654 --> 02:45:56,885
Is there anyone alive out there?

1943
02:45:58,415 --> 02:46:00,326
Can anyone hear me?

1944
02:46:02,215 --> 02:46:04,445
Is there anyone alive out there?

1945
02:46:11,176 --> 02:46:12,655
We waited too long.

1946
02:46:16,496 --> 02:46:18,852
Keep checking them! Keep looking!

1947
02:46:20,217 --> 02:46:22,447
Is there anyone alive out there?

1948
02:46:25,937 --> 02:46:27,609

There's a boat.

1956
02:47:51,185 --> 02:47:52,220
Jack?

1957
02:48:16,508 --> 02:48:18,226
There's a boat, Jack.

1958
02:49:00,192 --> 02:49:01,466
Come back.

1959
02:49:10,873 --> 02:49:12,147
Come back!

1960
02:49:16,793 --> 02:49:18,431
Hello!

1961
02:49:19,873 --> 02:49:21,705
Can anyone hear me?

1962
02:49:22,634 --> 02:49:24,590
There's nothing here, sir.

1963
02:49:26,394 --> 02:49:27,668
Come back.

1964
02:49:37,875 --> 02:49:40,628
I'll never let go. I promise.

1965
02:50:22,559 --> 02:50:23,878
Come about!

1966
02:50:44,521 --> 02:50:47,719
1,500 people went into the sea ...

1967
02:50:48,242 --> 02:50:51,075
when Titanic sank from under us.

1968
02:50:53,122 --> 02:50:55,875
There were 20 boats floating nearby ...

1969
02:50:57,202 --> 02:50:59,080
and only one came back.

1970
02:51:01,283 --> 02:51:02,272
One.

1971
02:51:04,003 --> 02:51:06,437
6 were saved from the water ...

1972
02:51:06,803 --> 02:51:08,362
myself included.

1973
02:51:09,764 --> 02:51:14,042
6 out of 1,500.

1974
02:51:17,204 --> 02:51:21,357
Afterward, 
the 700 people in the boats ...

1975
02:51:21,725 --> 02:51:24,034
had nothing to do but wait.

1976
02:51:25,805 --> 02:51:28,797
Wait to die, wait to live.

1977
02:51:30,286 --> 02:51:32,356
Wait for an absolution ...

1978
02:51:32,846 --> 02:51:34,757
that would never come.

1979
02:52:36,372 --> 02:52:38,647
Sir, I don't think you'll find
any of your people down here.

1980
02:52:38,732 --> 02:52:40,324
It's all steerage.

1981
02:52:45,213 --> 02:52:48,046
His hair is reddish brown,
and a white beard.

1982
02:52:48,173 --> 02:52:50,971
- Isn't there another passenger list?
- There's no other list.

1983
02:52:51,053 --> 02:52:54,363
- Perhaps he's on another ship.
- We're doing all we can.

1984
02:53:17,096 --> 02:53:19,610
That's the last time I ever saw him.

1985
02:53:19,816 --> 02:53:22,888
He married, of course,
and inherited his millions.

1986
02:53:24,056 --> 02:53:27,173
But the crash of '29 
hit his interests hard.

1987
02:53:27,576 --> 02:53:30,137
And he put a pistol 
in his mouth that year.

1988
02:53:30,457 --> 02:53:31,856
Or so I read.

1989
02:53:44,458 --> 02:53:46,574
Can I take your name, please, love?

1990
02:53:48,858 --> 02:53:49,974
Dawson.

1991
02:53:52,219 --> 02:53:53,572
Rose Dawson.

1992
02:53:54,659 --> 02:53:55,933
Thank you.

1993
02:54:02,620 --> 02:54:06,454
We never found anything on Jack.
There's no record of him at all.

1994
02:54:07,420 --> 02:54:09,297
No, there wouldn't be, would there?

1995
02:54:09,940 --> 02:54:14,457
And I've never spoken of him 
until now. Not to anyone.

1996
02:54:15,261 --> 02:54:17,331
Not even your grandfather.

1997
02:54:17,621 --> 02:54:20,897
A woman's heart
is a deep ocean of secrets.

1998
02:54:22,222 --> 02:54:25,498
But now you know there was a 
man named Jack Dawson ...

1999
02:54:25,982 --> 02:54:27,779
and that he saved me ...

2000
02:54:28,262 --> 02:54:31,015
in every way 
that a person can be saved.

2001
02:54:33,263 --> 02:54:35,652
I don't even have a picture of him.

2002
02:54:38,223 --> 02:54:41,932
He exists now only in my memory.

2003
02:54:46,784 --> 02:54:49,503
Keldysh, Mir-2 on our way 
to the surface.

2004
02:55:05,986 --> 02:55:08,898
I was saving this
for when I found the diamond.

2005
02:55:17,667 --> 02:55:18,941
I'm sorry.

2006
02:55:21,627 --> 02:55:22,946
3 years.

2007
02:55:23,587 --> 02:55:26,227
I've thought of nothing 
except Titanic.

2008
02:55:26,828 --> 02:55:28,546
But I never got it.

2009
02:55:31,523 --> 02:55:33,115
I never let it in.
