1
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,100
<i>The world is changed.</i>

2
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,300
<i>I feel it in the water.</i>

3
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,900
<i>I feel it in the earth.</i>

4
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,500
<i>I smell it in the air.</i>

5
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,900
<i>Much that once was...</i>

6
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,600
<i>...is lost.</i>

7
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,300
<i>For none now live who remember it.</i>

8
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,600
<i>It began with the forging</i>
<i>of the Great Rings.</i>

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,800
<i>Three were given to the Elves:</i>

10
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,700
<i>Immortal, wisest and fairest</i>
<i>of all beings.</i>

11
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,900
<i>Seven to the Dwarf-lords:</i>

12
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,000
<i>Great miners and craftsmen</i>
<i>of the mountain halls.</i>

13
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,800
<i>And nine...</i>

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,900
<i>...nine rings were gifted</i>
<i>to the race of Men...</i>

15
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:36,000
<i>...who, above all else, desire power.</i>

16
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:42,300
<i>For within these rings was bound</i>
<i>the strength and will to govern each race.</i>

17
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,900
<i>But they were all of them deceived.</i>

18
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,400
<i>For another ring was made.</i>

19
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,700
<i>In the land of Mordor,</i>
<i>in the fires of Mount Doom...</i>

20
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,600
<i>...the Dark Lord Sauron forged</i>
<i>in secret a Master Ring...</i>

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
<i>...to control all others.</i>

22
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,000
<i>And into this Ring he poured</i>
<i>his cruelty, his malice...</i>

23
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,400
<i>...and his will to dominate all life.</i>

24
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,200
<i>One Ring to rule them all.</i>

25
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,800
<i>One by one...</i>

26
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,600
<i>...the Free Lands of Middle-earth</i>
<i>fell to the power of the Ring.</i>

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,900
<i>But there were some who resisted.</i>

28
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,000
<i>A Last Alliance of Men and Elves</i>
<i>marched against the armies of Mordor.</i>

29
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,800
<i>And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they</i>
<i>fought for the freedom of Middle-earth.</i>

30
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,900
<i>Victory was near.</i>

31
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,400
<i>But the power of the Ring...</i>

32
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,700
<i>...could not be undone.</i>

33
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,100
<i>It was in this moment...</i>

34
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,700
<i>...when all hope had faded...</i>

35
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
<i>...that Isildur, son of the king,</i>
<i>took up his father's sword.</i>

36
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:27,500
<i>Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples</i>
<i>of Middle-earth, was defeated.</i>

37
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,700
<i>The Ring passed to Isildur...</i>

38
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
<i>...who had this one chance</i>
<i>to destroy evil forever.</i>

39
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,000
<i>But the hearts of Men...</i>

40
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,700
<i>...are easily corrupted.</i>

41
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,400
<i>And the Ring of Power</i>
<i>has a will of its own.</i>

42
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,300
<i>It betrayed Isildur...</i>

43
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,600
<i>...to his death.</i>

44
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,600
<i>And some things</i>
<i>that should not have been forgotten...</i>

45
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,200
<i>...were lost.</i>

46
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,300
<i>History became legend...</i>

47
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,500
<i>...legend became myth.</i>

48
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,500
<i>And for</i>
<i>two and a half thousand years...</i>

49
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,400
<i>...the Ring passed</i>
<i>out of all knowledge.</i>

50
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,900
<i>Until, when chance came...</i>

51
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,600
<i>...it ensnared a new bearer.</i>

52
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,800
My precious.

53
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,600
<i>The Ring came to the creature</i>
<i>Gollum...</i>

54
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,700
<i>...who took it deep into the tunnels</i>
<i>of the Misty Mountains.</i>

55
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,900
<i>And there it consumed him.</i>

56
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,200
It came to me.

57
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,700
My own. My love. My own.

58
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,600
My precious.

59
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,700
<i>The Ring brought to Gollum</i>
<i>unnatural long life.</i>

60
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,800
<i>For 500 years it poisoned his mind.</i>

61
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:37,500
<i>And in the gloom of Gollum's cave,</i>
<i>it waited.</i>

62
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,000
<i>Darkness crept back</i>
<i>into the forests of the world.</i>

63
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,100
<i>Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...</i>

64
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,100
<i>...whispers of a nameless fear.</i>

65
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,600
<i>And the Ring of Power perceived...</i>

66
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,700
<i>...its time had now come.</i>

67
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,800
<i>It abandoned Gollum.</i>

68
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,800
<i>But something happened then</i>
<i>the Ring did not intend.</i>

69
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,200
<i>It was picked up by the most unlikely</i>
<i>creature imaginable.</i>

70
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,600
What's this?

71
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,300
<i>A Hobbit.</i>

72
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,200
<i>Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.</i>

73
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,200
A ring.

74
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,300
Lost!

75
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,300
My precious is lost!

76
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,900
<i>For the time will soon come...</i>

77
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:33,200
<i>...when Hobbits will shape</i>
<i>the fortunes of all.</i>

78
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,100
The 22nd day of September...

79
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,500
...in the year 1400...

80
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,100
...by Shire-reckoning.

81
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,900
Bag End, Bagshot Row, Hobbiton,
Westfarthing...

82
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,200
...the Shire...

83
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,200
...Middle-earth.

84
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,200
The Third Age of this world.

85
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,700
<i>There and Back Again:</i>

86
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,100
<i>A Hobbit's Tale.</i>

87
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,200
By Bilbo Baggins.

88
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,800
Now...

89
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,500
...where to begin?

90
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,900
Ah, yes...

91
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,200
"Concerning...

92
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,900
...Hobbits."

93
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,500
<i>Hobbits have been living and farming</i>
<i>in the four Farthings of the Shire...</i>

94
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,700
<i>...for many hundreds of years...</i>

95
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,900
<i>...quite content to ignore</i>
<i>and be ignored...</i>

96
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,200
<i>...by the world of the Big Folk.</i>

97
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,100
<i>Middle-earth being, after all,</i>
<i>full of strange creatures beyond count...</i>

98
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,600
<i>...Hobbits must seem</i>
<i>of little importance...</i>

99
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,700
<i>...being neither renowned</i>
<i>as great warriors...</i>

100
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,100
<i>...nor counted among the very wise.</i>

101
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,500
Frodo! Someone at the door.

102
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,300
<i>In fact, it has been remarked by some...</i>

103
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,800
<i>...that Hobbits' only real passion</i>
<i>is for food.</i>

104
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,500
<i>A rather unfair observation...</i>

105
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,300
<i>...as we have also developed a keen</i>
<i>interest in the brewing of ales...</i>

106
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,500
<i>...and the smoking of pipe-weed.</i>

107
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,800
<i>But where our hearts truly lie...</i>

108
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,100
<i>...is in peace and quiet...</i>

109
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,100
<i>...and good, tilled earth.</i>

110
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:59,300
<i>For all Hobbits share a love</i>
<i>of things that grow.</i>

111
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,800
<i>And, yes, no doubt to others,</i>
<i>our ways seem quaint.</i>

112
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,300
<i>But today of all days,</i>
<i>it is brought home to me:</i>

113
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,700
<i>It is no bad thing</i>
<i>to celebrate a simple life.</i>

114
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,200
Frodo, the door!

115
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,000
Sticklebacks. Where is that boy?

116
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,900
Frodo!

117
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,200
<i>Down from the door where it began</i>

118
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,800
<i>And I must follow if I can</i>

119
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,900
<i>The road goes ever on and on</i>

120
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,500
<i>Down from the door where it began</i>

121
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:05,700
<i>Now far ahead the road has gone</i>

122
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,100
- <i>And I must follow if I can</i>
- You're late.

123
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,200
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.

124
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,600
Nor is he early. He arrives
precisely when he means to.

125
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,000
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

126
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,600
You didn't think I'd miss
your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?

127
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,500
How is the old rascal?

128
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,500
I hear it's going to be a party
of special magnificence.

129
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,200
You know Bilbo.
He's got the whole place in an uproar.

130
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,300
Well, that should please him.

131
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,400
Half the Shire's been invited.

132
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,300
And the rest of them are turning up
anyway.

133
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,700
<i>And so life in the Shire goes</i> on...

134
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,000
<i>...very much as it has</i>
<i>this past Age...</i>

135
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:17,600
<i>...full of its own comings and goings,</i>
<i>with change coming slowly.</i>

136
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,800
<i>If it comes at all.</i>

137
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,500
<i>For things are made to endure</i>
<i>in the Shire...</i>

138
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,100
<i>...passing from one generation</i>
<i>to the next.</i>

139
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,500
<i>There's always been a Baggins</i>
<i>living here under the Hill...</i>

140
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,200
<i>...in Bag End.</i>

141
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,600
And there always will be.

142
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,800
To tell you the truth,
Bilbo's been a bit odd lately.

143
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,300
I mean, more than usual.

144
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,200
He's taken to locking himself
in his study.

145
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,800
<i>He spends hours poring over old maps</i>
<i>when he thinks I'm not looking.</i>

146
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,300
Where's it gone?

147
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,200
He's up to something.

148
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,800
- All right, then. Keep your secrets.
- What?

149
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,800
But I know you have something
to do with it.

150
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,100
Good gracious me.

151
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,300
Before you came along, we Bagginses
were very well thought of.

152
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,500
Indeed.

153
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,900
Never had any adventures
or did anything unexpected.

154
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,300
If you're referring to the incident
with the dragon, I was barely involved.

155
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:11,100
All I did was give your uncle
a little nudge out of the door.

156
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,400
Whatever you did, you've been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace.

157
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,700
Oh, really?

158
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,400
Gandalf! Gandalf!

159
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,800
Fireworks, Gandalf!

160
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,500
- Gandalf!
- Fireworks, Gandalf!

161
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,300
Gandalf?

162
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,900
- I'm glad you're back.
- So am I, dear boy.

163
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,200
So am I.

164
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,500
No, thank you!

165
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,600
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers or distant relations!

166
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,400
And what about very old friends?

167
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,200
Gandalf?

168
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,300
- Bilbo Baggins.
- My dear Gandalf!

169
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:04,600
Good to see you. 111 years old!
Who would believe it?

170
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,500
You haven't aged a day.

171
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,100
Come on, come in!

172
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,700
Welcome, welcome.

173
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,300
Oh, here we are.

174
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,500
Tea? Or maybe something
a little stronger?

175
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,400
I've got a few bottles
of the Old Winyard left. 1296.

176
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,700
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.

177
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,300
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?

178
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,300
Just tea, thank you.

179
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,400
I was expecting you sometime
last week.

180
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,700
Not that it matters. You come and go as
you please. Always have and always will.

181
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:01,100
You caught me a bit unprepared. We've only
got cold chicken and a bit of pickle...

182
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,800
There's some cheese here.
No, that won't do.

183
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,900
We've got raspberry jam,
an apple tart...

184
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:13,500
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we're all right.

185
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,600
I've just found some sponge cake.

186
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,900
I could make you some eggs
if you'd...

187
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,400
- just tea, thank you.
- Oh, right.

188
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,800
- You don't mind if I eat, do you?
- No, not at all.

189
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,700
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!

190
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,500
I'm not at home!

191
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,100
It's the Sackville-Bagginses.

192
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
- I know you're in there!
- They're after the house.

193
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,600
They've never forgiven me
for living this long.

194
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,600
I've got to get away from these confounded
relatives, hanging on the bell all day...

195
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,700
...never giving me a moment's peace.

196
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,900
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, Gandalf!

197
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:03,600
And then find somewhere quiet
where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.

198
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,800
- So you mean to go through with your plan?
- Yes, yes. It's all in hand.

199
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,300
All the arrangements are made.

200
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,900
Oh, thank you.

201
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,700
Frodo suspects something.

202
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,400
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...

203
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,200
...not some blockheaded Bracegirdle
from Hardbottle.

204
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,500
You will tell him, won't you?

205
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,500
- Yes, yes.
- He's very fond of you.

206
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,200
I know.

207
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,900
He'd probably come with me
if I asked him.

208
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,000
I think in his heart, Frodo's
still in love with the Shire.

209
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,900
The woods, the fields.

210
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,400
Little rivers.

211
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,600
I am old, Gandalf.

212
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,100
I know I don't look it, but I'm
beginning to feel it in my heart.

213
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,800
I feel thin.

214
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,800
Sort of stretched...

215
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,400
...like butter scraped
over too much bread.

216
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:18,000
I need a holiday. A very long holiday.

217
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,500
And I don't expect I shall return.

218
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,900
In fact, I mean not to.

219
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,700
Old Toby. The finest weed
in the Southfarthing.

220
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,500
Gandalf, my old friend...

221
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,600
...this will be a night to remember.

222
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,600
Hello, hello.

223
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,700
Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

224
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,300
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.

225
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,600
- I think I'll just have another ale.
- Oh, no, you don't.

226
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,400
Go on!

227
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,400
So there I was...

228
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,500
...at the mercy
of three monstrous trolls.

229
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,900
And they were all arguing
amongst themselves...

230
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,400
...about how they were
going to cook us.

231
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:03,600
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit
on us one by one, squash us into jelly.

232
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,100
They spent so much time arguing
the whithertos and the whyfors...

233
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,000
...that the sun's first light
crept over the top of the trees...

234
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,500
...and turned them all to stone!

235
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,200
Quickly.

236
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,400
Up they go!

237
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,500
No, the big one.

238
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,400
Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

239
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,600
Are all these children yours?

240
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,800
Good gracious,
you have been productive.

241
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,200
Bilbo?

242
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,600
Sackville-Bagginses!

243
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,900
Quickly, hide!

244
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,900
Thank you, my boy.

245
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,800
You're a good lad, Frodo.

246
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,800
I'm very selfish, you know.

247
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,700
Yes, I am. Very selfish.

248
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,300
I don't know why I took you in
after your mother and father died...

249
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,000
...but it wasn't out of charity.

250
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,000
I think it was because...

251
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,500
...of all my numerous relations...

252
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,300
...you were the one Baggins
that showed real spirit.

253
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,400
Bilbo, have you been
at the Gaffer's home brew?

254
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,300
No.

255
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,200
Well, yes, but that's not the point.

256
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,700
The point is, Frodo...

257
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,700
...you'll be all right.

258
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,200
- Done!
- You're supposed to stick it in the ground.

259
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,900
- It is in the ground.
- Outside!

260
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,600
This was your idea.

261
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,000
Bilbo.

262
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,900
Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!

263
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,500
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon
in these parts for a thousand years.

264
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,600
- That was good.
- Let's get another one.

265
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:46,400
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.

266
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,500
I might've known.

267
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,500
Speech, Bilbo!

268
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,700
Speech!

269
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,900
Speech!

270
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,400
My dear Bagginses and Boffins...

271
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,300
...Tooks and Brandybucks...

272
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,000
...Grubbs, Chubbs...

273
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,300
...Hornblowers...

274
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,100
...Bolgers...

275
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,100
...Bracegirdles...

276
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,900
...and Proudfoots.
- Proudfeet!

277
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,200
Today is my 111th birthday!

278
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,600
Happy birthday!

279
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,900
But alas, eleventy-one years is
far too short a time to live among...

280
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,100
...such excellent
and admirable Hobbits.

281
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,800
I don't know half of you
half as well as I should like...

282
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:46,500
...and I like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve.

283
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,000
I have things to do.

284
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,500
I've put this off far too long.

285
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,200
I regret to announce this is the end!

286
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,600
I'm going now.

287
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,600
I bid you all a very fond farewell.

288
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,200
Goodbye.

289
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,500
I suppose you think
that was terribly clever.

290
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:05,100
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?

291
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:10,200
There are many magic rings in this world,
and none of them should be used lightly.

292
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,700
It was just a bit of fun.

293
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,600
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.

294
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,500
- You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
- Two eyes.

295
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,500
As often as I can spare them.

296
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,800
- I'm leaving everything to him.
- What about this ring of yours?

297
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,300
- Is that staying too?
- Yes, yes.

298
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,800
It's in an envelope over there
on the mantelpiece.

299
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,900
No. Wait, it's...

300
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,100
...here in my pocket.

301
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,900
Isn't that...? Isn't that odd, now?

302
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:58,100
Yet, after all, why not?

303
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:04,400
- Why shouldn't I keep it?
- I think you should leave the ring behind.

304
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,100
Is that so hard?

305
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,700
Well, no.

306
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,700
And yes.

307
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,600
Now it comes to it,
I don't feel like parting with it.

308
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,700
It's mine. I found it! It came to me!

309
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
- There's no need to get angry.
- Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!

310
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,300
It's mine.

311
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,100
My own.

312
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,300
- My precious.
- Precious?

313
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,500
It's been called that before,
but not by you.

314
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,200
What business is it of yours
what I do with my own things?

315
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,200
I think you've had that ring
quite long enough.

316
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,200
- You want it for yourself!
- Bilbo Baggins!

317
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,600
Do not take me for some conjurer
of cheap tricks.

318
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,500
I am not trying to rob you.

319
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,300
I'm trying to help you.

320
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,100
All your long years,
we've been friends.

321
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,600
Trust me as you once did.

322
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,400
Let it go.

323
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,900
You're right, Gandalf.

324
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,700
The ring must go to Frodo.

325
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,000
It's late. The road is long.

326
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,700
Yes, it is time.

327
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:42,400
Bilbo, the ring is still in your pocket.

328
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,200
I've thought up an ending for my book:

329
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:26,700
"And he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days."

330
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,400
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

331
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,000
Goodbye, Gandalf.

332
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,400
Goodbye, dear Bilbo.

333
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:50,300
<i>The road goes ever on and on</i>

334
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,400
Until our next meeting.

335
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,300
<i>It's mine. My own.</i>

336
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,000
<i>My precious.</i>

337
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,100
Riddles in the dark.

338
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,900
Bilbo!

339
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,600
Bilbo!

340
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,100
My precious.

341
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,900
Precious.

342
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,700
He's gone, hasn't he?

343
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,500
He talked for so long about leaving...

344
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,500
...I didn't think he'd really do it.

345
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,900
Gandalf?

346
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,800
Bilbo's ring.

347
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,500
He's gone to stay with the Elves.

348
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,800
He's left you Bag End.

349
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,800
Along with all his possessions.

350
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,900
The ring is yours now.

351
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,000
- Put it somewhere out of sight.
- Where are you going?

352
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,500
- There are some things that I must see to.
- What things?

353
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,900
- Questions. Questions that need answering.
- You've only just arrived.

354
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,500
I don't understand.

355
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,900
Neither do I.

356
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,400
Keep it secret.

357
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,500
Keep it safe.

358
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,600
<i>Shire!</i>

359
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
<i>Baggins!</i>

360
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,500
<i>"The year 3434 of the Second Age.</i>

361
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:35,000
<i>Here follows the account of Isildur,</i>
<i>High King of Gondor...</i>

362
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,900
<i>...and the finding</i>
<i>of the Ring of Power. "

363
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,300
<i>"It has come to me.</i>

364
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,900
<i>The One Ring. It shall be</i>
<i>an heirloom of my kingdom.</i>

365
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,500
<i>All those who follow in my bloodline</i>
<i>shall be bound to its fate...</i>

366
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:55,500
<i>...for I will risk</i>
<i>no hurt to the Ring.</i>

367
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,200
<i>It is precious to</i> me...

368
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,800
<i>...though I buy it with great pain.</i>

369
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
<i>The markings upon the band</i>
<i>begin to fade.</i>

370
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:14,100
<i>The writing, which at first was as clear</i>
<i>as red flame, has all but disappeared.</i>

371
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,400
<i>A secret now</i>
<i>that only fire can tell. "

372
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,800
Shire.

373
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,100
Baggins.

374
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:44,500
There's no Bagginses around here.
They're all up in Hobbiton.

375
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,900
That way.

376
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
<i>To heal my heart and drown my woe</i>

377
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,500
<i>Rain may fall and wind may blow</i>

378
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,700
<i>But there still be</i>

379
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,300
<i>Many miles to go</i>

380
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,400
<i>Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain</i>

381
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,800
<i>And the stream that falls</i>
<i>From hill to plain</i>

382
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,800
<i>Better than rain or rippling brook</i>

383
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,400
<i>Is a mug of beer inside this Took</i>

384
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,600
There's been some strange folk
crossing the Shire.

385
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,900
Dwarves and others of a less
than savory nature.

386
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,900
War is brewing.

387
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,300
The mountains are fair teeming
with goblins.

388
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,200
Far-off tales and children's stories,
that's all that is.

389
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:34,800
You're beginning to sound like that old
Bilbo Baggins. Cracked, he was.

390
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,000
Young Mr. Frodo here,
he's cracking.

391
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,600
And proud of it.

392
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,100
- Cheers, Gaffer.
- Cheers.

393
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,300
It's none of our concern what goes on
beyond our borders.

394
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:50,700
Keep your nose out of trouble,
and no trouble'll come to you.

395
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,500
- Good night, lads.
- Good night.

396
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:00,900
Good night, sweet maiden
of the golden ale.

397
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,600
Mind who you're sweet-talking.

398
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:08,200
Don't worry, Sam. Rosie knows an idiot
when she sees one.

399
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,700
Does she?

400
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,200
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night, Mister Frodo.

401
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,500
Is it secret? Is it safe?

402
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,500
What are you doing?

403
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,600
Hold out your hand, Frodo.

404
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,100
It's quite cool.

405
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,300
What can you see?

406
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,500
Can you see anything?

407
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,600
Nothing.

408
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,300
There's nothing.

409
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,800
Wait.

410
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,100
There are markings.

411
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,000
It's some form of Elvish.
I can't read it.

412
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,800
There are few who can.

413
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:47,100
The language is that of Mordor,
which I will not utter here.

414
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,900
Mordor!

415
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,100
In the common tongue, it says:

416
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,800
"One Ring to rule them all...

417
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,400
...One Ring to find them...

418
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,900
...One Ring to bring them all...

419
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,100
...and in the darkness bind them."

420
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,800
This is the One Ring...

421
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,200
...forged by the Dark Lord Sauron
in the fires of Mount Doom.

422
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,500
Taken by Isildur
from the hand of Sauron himself.

423
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,900
Bilbo found it.

424
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,200
- In Gollum's cave.
- Yes.

425
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,900
For 60 years, the Ring lay quiet
in Bilbo's keeping...

426
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,500
...prolonging his life,
delaying old age.

427
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,600
But no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor.

428
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,200
The Ring has awoken.

429
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,200
It's heard its master's call.

430
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:45,300
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.

431
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,100
No, Frodo.

432
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,300
The spirit of Sauron endured.

433
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:02,800
His life force is bound to the Ring,
and the Ring survived.

434
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,400
Sauron has returned.

435
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,400
His Orcs have multiplied.

436
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:12,500
His fortress at Barad-dr
is rebuilt in the land of Mordor.

437
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:17,500
Sauron needs only this Ring to cover
all the lands in a second darkness.

438
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,900
He is seeking it.

439
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,900
Seeking it. All his thought
is bent on it.

440
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,800
For the Ring yearns above all else...

441
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:30,400
...to return to the hand
of its master.

442
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,500
They are one...

443
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,700
...the Ring and the Dark Lord.

444
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Frodo...

445
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,400
...he must never find it.

446
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,700
All right.

447
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:45,200
We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.

448
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,200
No one knows it's here, do they?

449
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,000
Do they, Gandalf?

450
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,400
There is one other who knew
that Bilbo had the Ring.

451
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,700
I looked everywhere
for the creature Gollum.

452
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
But the enemy found him first.

453
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,300
<i>I don't know how long</i>
<i>they tortured him.</i>

454
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:14,900
<i>But amidst the endless screams and</i>
<i>inane babble, they discerned two words:</i>

455
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,300
Shire!

456
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,200
Baggins!

457
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,200
Shire.

458
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,200
Baggins. But that would
lead them here!

459
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,200
Who goes there?

460
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,100
Take it, Gandalf!

461
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,600
- Take it!
- No, Frodo.

462
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,000
- You must take it!
- You cannot offer me this ring!

463
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,500
- I'm giving it to you!
- Don't tempt me, Frodo!

464
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,300
I dare not take it.

465
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,100
Not even to keep it safe.

466
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,300
Understand, Frodo...

467
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:52,500
...I would use this Ring
from a desire to do good.

468
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:03,600
But through me, it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine.

469
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,200
- But it cannot stay in the Shire!
- No.

470
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,700
No, it can't.

471
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,500
What must I do?

472
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,600
- You must leave. And leave quickly.
- Where? Where do I go?

473
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,100
Get out of the Shire.
Make for the village of Bree.

474
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,500
Bree.

475
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,500
- What about you?
- I'll be waiting for you...

476
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,100
...at the inn of the Prancing Pony.

477
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:37,000
- And the Ring will be safe there?
- I don't know, Frodo.

478
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,300
I don't have any answers.

479
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:46,200
I must see the head of my order. He is
both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.

480
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,600
He'll know what to do.

481
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:52,000
You'll have to leave the name
of Baggins behind you.

482
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,800
That name is not safe
outside the Shire.

483
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,700
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.

484
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,600
I can cut across country
easily enough.

485
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,500
My dear Frodo.

486
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,700
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.

487
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,800
You can learn all that there is to
know about their ways in a month.

488
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,400
And yet, after a hundred years...

489
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,600
...they can still surprise you.

490
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,700
Get down.

491
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:36,200
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?

492
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:40,900
I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.
I was cutting the grass under the window.

493
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,600
A little late for trimming the verge,
don't you think?

494
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,600
- I heard raised voices.
- What did you hear? Speak!

495
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Nothing important.

496
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:52,600
That is, I heard a good deal about a ring,
a Dark Lord and the end of the world but...

497
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:57,400
Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural.

498
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,000
No?

499
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,300
Perhaps not.

500
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,900
I've thought of a better use for you.

501
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,600
Come along, Samwise. Keep up.

502
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,400
Be careful, both of you.

503
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,400
The enemy has many spies
in his service:

504
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,600
Birds, beasts.

505
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,200
Is it safe?

506
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,200
Never put it on...

507
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:31,800
...for the agents of the Dark Lord
will be drawn to its power.

508
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,500
Always remember, Frodo...

509
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:37,100
...the Ring is trying to get back
to its master.

510
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,700
It wants to be found.

511
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,500
This is it.

512
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,900
This is what?

513
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,300
If I take one more step...

514
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:31,600
...it'll be the farthest away
from home I've ever been.

515
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,500
Come on, Sam.

516
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,800
Remember what Bilbo used to say:

517
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,000
- "It's a dangerous business, Frodo."
- <i>"Going out your door.</i>

518
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:56,600
<i>You step onto the road,</i>
<i>and if you don't keep your feet...</i>

519
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
<i>...there's no knowing where</i>
<i>you might be swept off to. "

520
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,700
Sam.

521
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,400
Wood-elves.

522
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,600
They're going to the harbor
beyond the White Towers.

523
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,900
To the Grey Havens.

524
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,400
They're leaving Middle-earth.

525
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,900
Never to return.

526
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,900
I don't know why...

527
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,900
...it makes me sad.

528
00:45:56,100 --> 00:46:00,600
Everywhere I lie there's a dirty
great root sticking into my back.

529
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,100
Just shut your eyes...

530
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,000
...and imagine you're back
in your own bed...

531
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:10,100
...with a soft mattress
and a lovely feather pillow.

532
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,200
It's not working, Mr. Frodo.

533
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,200
I'm never going to be able
to sleep out here.

534
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:29,900
Me neither, Sam.

535
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:01,500
<i>Smoke rises</i>
<i>from the Mountain of Doom.</i>

536
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,300
<i>The hour grows late.</i>

537
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:07,100
<i>And Gandalf the Grey</i>
<i>rides to Isengard...</i>

538
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,700
<i>...seeking my counsel.</i>

539
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,800
For that is why you have come,
is it not?

540
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,400
My old friend.

541
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,300
Saruman.

542
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,000
- You are sure of this?
- Beyond any doubt.

543
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,200
So the Ring of Power has been found.

544
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,600
All these long years,
it was in the Shire.

545
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:34,900
- Under my very nose.
- Yet you did not have the wit to see it.

546
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:39,900
Your love of the halfling's leaf
has clearly slowed your mind.

547
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,800
But we still have time. Time enough
to counter Sauron if we act quickly.

548
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,700
Time?

549
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:50,200
What time do you think we have?

550
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:54,400
Sauron has regained
much of his former strength.

551
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,900
He cannot yet take physical form...

552
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,800
...but his spirit has lost
none of its potency.

553
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:05,400
Concealed within his fortress,
the Lord of Mordor sees all.

554
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:11,900
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow,
earth and flesh.

555
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,600
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.

556
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:22,700
A Great Eye, lidless,
wreathed in flame.

557
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,700
The Eye of Sauron.

558
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,300
He is gathering all evil to him.

559
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,800
Very soon, he'll have summoned
an army...

560
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,600
...great enough for an assault
upon Middle-earth.

561
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,400
You know this?

562
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,500
How?

563
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,700
I have seen it.

564
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:44,300
A palantr is a dangerous tool,
Saruman.

565
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:46,500
Why?

566
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:49,700
Why should we fear to use it?

567
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:56,200
They are not all accounted for,
the lost Seeing-stones.

568
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,700
We do not know who else
may be watching.

569
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,000
The hour is later than you think.

570
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:07,500
Sauron's forces are already moving.

571
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:12,500
The Nine have left Minas Morgul.

572
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,100
The Nine?

573
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:17,100
They crossed the River Isen
on Midsummer's Eve...

574
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,000
...disguised as riders in black.

575
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,200
- They've reached the Shire?
- They will find the Ring.

576
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,100
And kill the one who carries it.

577
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,100
Frodo!

578
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:47,000
You did not seriously think that a Hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?

579
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,600
There are none who can.

580
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,800
Against the power of Mordor...

581
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:58,600
...there can be no victory.

582
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:03,800
We must join with him, Gandalf.

583
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,400
We must join with Sauron.

584
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,800
It would be wise, my friend.

585
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:14,700
Tell me...

586
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
...friend...

587
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:21,400
...when did Saruman the Wise
abandon reason for madness?

588
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,700
I gave you the chance...

589
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,400
...of aiding me willingly...

590
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,700
...but you have elected
the way of pain!

591
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,600
Mr. Frodo?

592
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,000
Frodo? Frodo!

593
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:42,600
- I thought I'd lost you.
- What are you talking about?

594
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,800
- It's just something Gandalf said.
- What did he say?

595
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,500
"Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee."
And I don't mean to.

596
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:54,400
Sam, we're still in the Shire.
What could possibly happen?

597
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:58,500
Frodo.

598
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,900
- Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
- Hello, Frodo.

599
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,500
Get off him.

600
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:04,500
Come on, Frodo.

601
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,600
What's the meaning of this?

602
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,100
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

603
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,400
You get back here!

604
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,800
Get out of my field!

605
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,700
You'll know the devil
if I catch up with you!

606
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:21,900
I don't know why he's so upset.
It's only a couple of carrots.

607
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,200
And some cabbages.

608
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:26,200
And those three bags of potatoes
that we lifted last week.

609
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:30,500
- And then the mushrooms the week before.
- Yes, Pippin. My point is...

610
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,900
...he's clearly overreacting.

611
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,600
Run!

612
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,600
Oh, that was close.

613
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:54,800
I think I've broken something.

614
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,200
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!

615
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:02,000
What? That was just a detour.
A short cut.

616
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:04,500
- Short cut to what?
- Mushrooms!

617
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,800
That's mine.

618
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,100
That's nice, Merry.

619
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,700
Here's a nice one, Sam.

620
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,400
I think we should get off the road.

621
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:35,000
Get off the road!

622
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:36,800
Quick!

623
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,900
Be quiet!

624
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,300
What was that?

625
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:33,500
Anything?

626
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:35,700
Nothing.

627
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,700
What is going on?

628
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:43,000
That Black Rider was looking
for something. Or someone.

629
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:45,900
Frodo?

630
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:47,600
Get down!

631
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:06,800
I have to leave the Shire.

632
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:10,000
Sam and I must get to Bree.

633
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,700
Right.

634
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,300
Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me.

635
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:25,000
Run!

636
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,100
This way! Follow me!

637
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:32,900
Run!

638
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:47,900
Get the rope, Sam!

639
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,000
Frodo!

640
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,200
Run, Frodo!

641
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:55,600
Go!
- Hurry!

642
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:58,400
Frodo, come on!

643
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,400
- Come on! Faster!
- Jump!

644
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,400
- How far to the nearest crossing?
- The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles.

645
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:36,700
Come on.

646
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:51,200
- What do you want?
- We're heading for the Prancing Pony.

647
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:57,600
Hobbits. Four Hobbits!

648
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:01,700
What's more, out of the Shire by your
talk. What business brings you to Bree?

649
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,300
We wish to stay at the inn.
Our business is our own.

650
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,900
All right, young sir.
I meant no offense.

651
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:11,700
It's my job to ask questions
after nightfall.

652
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,700
There's talk of strange folk abroad.

653
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:17,100
Can't be too careful.

654
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:40,300
Out of the way!
Watch where you're walking.

655
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,000
Excuse me.

656
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:09,700
Good evening, little masters.
What can I do for you?

657
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:15,800
If you're seeking accommodation, we got
some cozy Hobbit-sized rooms available.

658
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:20,800
Always proud to cater
to the Little Folk, Mister?

659
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,000
Underhill. My name's Underhill.

660
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,800
- Underhill, yes.
- We're friends of Gandalf the Grey.

661
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:31,200
- Can you tell him we've arrived?
- Gandalf?

662
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,300
Gandalf.

663
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,800
Oh, yes...

664
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,100
...I remember. Elderly chap.

665
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:41,400
Big grey beard, pointy hat.

666
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:43,600
Not seen him for six months.

667
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:51,800
What do we do now?

668
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,200
Sam...

669
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,300
...he'll be here. He'll come.

670
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:07,100
Get out of my way!

671
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,200
What's that?

672
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,800
This, my friend, is a pint.

673
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:15,700
It comes in pints?

674
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:19,700
- I'm getting one.
- You got a whole half already!

675
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:29,800
That fellow's done nothing
but stare at you since we arrived.

676
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,000
Excuse me.

677
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:39,800
That Man in the corner. Who is he?

678
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,200
He's one of them Rangers. They're
dangerous folk, wandering the Wilds.

679
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:50,000
What his right name is, I've never heard,
but around here he's known as Strider.

680
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:53,700
Strider.

681
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:09,900
<i>Baggins.</i>

682
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,000
<i>Baggins.</i>

683
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,500
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.

684
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:33,200
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.

685
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:36,400
He's my second cousin,
once removed on his mother's side...

686
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:38,900
...and my third cousin, twice removed...

687
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,200
- Pippin!
- Steady on, Frodo.

688
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:17,200
You cannot hide.

689
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:23,200
I see you.

690
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:27,700
There is no life...

691
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
...in the void.

692
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:31,800
Only...

693
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,200
...death.

694
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:44,900
You draw far too much attention
to yourself, "Mr. Underhill."

695
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:50,800
What do you want?

696
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:53,000
A little more caution from you.
That is no trinket you carry.

697
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:56,400
- I carry nothing.
- Indeed.

698
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:59,200
I can avoid being seen if I wish...

699
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:03,000
...but to disappear entirely,
that is a rare gift.

700
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:06,200
- Who are you?
- Are you frightened?

701
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:08,500
Yes.

702
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:12,500
Not nearly frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.

703
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:19,100
Let him go!
Or I'll have you, Longshanks.

704
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:24,800
You have a stout heart, little Hobbit.
But that will not save you.

705
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:27,900
You can no longer wait
for the wizard, Frodo.

706
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:29,400
They're coming.

707
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:54,400
What are they?

708
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:58,700
They were once Men.

709
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,100
Great kings of Men.

710
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:04,700
Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them
nine rings of power.

711
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:08,400
Blinded by their greed,
they took them without question.

712
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:11,900
One by one, falling into darkness.

713
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:14,600
Now they are slaves to his will.

714
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:18,800
They are the NazgI.

715
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:21,700
Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

716
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:23,800
At all times they feel...

717
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,000
<i>...the presence of the Ring...</i>

718
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:30,600
<i>...drawn to the power of the One.</i>
<i>They will never stop hunting you.</i>

719
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:43,600
- Where are you taking us?
- Into the Wild.

720
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:55,800
How do we know this Strider
is a friend of Gandalf?

721
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:58,900
I think a servant of the enemy
would look fairer...

722
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:03,100
...and feel fouler.
- He's foul enough.

723
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:06,600
We have no choice but to trust him.

724
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,300
- But where is he leading us?
- To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.

725
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:15,900
- To the house of Elrond.
- Did you hear that? Rivendell.

726
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:19,300
We're going to see the Elves.

727
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:45,000
- Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.
- What about breakfast?

728
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:48,000
- You've already had it.
- We've had one, yes.

729
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:50,400
What about second breakfast?

730
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Don't think he knows
about second breakfast, Pip.

731
01:06:57,300 --> 01:07:02,300
What about elevenses? Luncheon?
Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?

732
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:06,700
- He knows about them, doesn't he?
- I wouldn't count on it.

733
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,900
Pippin!

734
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:33,900
What do they eat
when they can't get Hobbit?

735
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,900
Who is she?

736
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:18,200
This woman you sing of.

737
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:24,000
'Tis the lady of Lthien.

738
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:29,300
The Elf-maiden who gave her love
to Beren, a mortal.

739
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:33,300
What happened to her?

740
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,000
She died.

741
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,400
Get some sleep, Frodo.

742
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:58,700
<i>The power of Isengard</i>
<i>is at your command...</i>

743
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:03,300
<i>...Sauron, Lord of the Earth.</i>

744
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:12,400
<i>Build me an army worthy of Mordor.</i>

745
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:22,500
What orders from Mordor, my lord?
What does the Eye command?

746
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,000
We have work to do.

747
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:12,100
The trees are strong, my lord.
Their roots go deep.

748
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:14,500
Rip them all down.

749
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,700
This was the great watchtower
of Amon SI.

750
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:49,100
We shall rest here tonight.

751
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:04,200
These are for you.
Keep them close.

752
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:06,900
I'm going to have a look around.

753
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:11,200
Stay here.

754
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:15,900
My tomato's burst.

755
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:18,100
Could I have some bacon?

756
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,200
Want a tomato, Sam?

757
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:24,200
- What are you doing?!
- Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.

758
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:27,100
- We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.
- Put it out, you fools!

759
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:31,200
- Put it out!
- That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!

760
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:41,500
Go!

761
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:36,500
Back, you devils!

762
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:01,200
Frodo!

763
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,100
Oh, Sam.

764
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:45,200
Strider!

765
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:53,200
- Help him, Strider.
- He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.

766
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:59,600
This is beyond my skill to heal.
He needs Elvish medicine.

767
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,400
Hurry!

768
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:09,500
We're six days from Rivendell!
He'll never make it!

769
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:11,600
Hold on, Frodo.

770
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:14,200
Gandalf!

771
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:55,300
Look, Frodo. It's Mr. Bilbo's trolls.

772
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:00,300
Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.

773
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:05,000
Is he going to die?

774
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:10,000
He's passing into the Shadow World.
He'll soon become a Wraith like them.

775
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:19,000
- They're close.
- Sam, do you know the Athelas plant?

776
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:20,800
- Athelas?
- Kingsfoil.

777
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed.

778
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:25,300
It may help to slow the poisoning.
Hurry!

779
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:43,800
What's this?
A Ranger caught off his guard?

780
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:09,800
Frodo.

781
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:14,800
I am Arwen - I've come to help you.

782
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:14,800
I am Arwen - I've come to help you.

783
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:19,100
Hear my voice...

784
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:19,100
Hear my voice...

785
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:21,500
Come back to the light.

786
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:21,500
Come back to the light.

787
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:28,500
Who is she?

788
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:30,900
Frodo.

789
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:34,600
- She's an Elf.
- He's fading.

790
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,100
He's not going to last.

791
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:42,000
We must get him to my father.

792
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:45,600
- I've been looking for you for two days.
- Where are you taking him?

793
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:51,800
There are five Wraiths behind you.
Where the other four are, I do not know.

794
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:55,400
Stay with the Hobbits -
I'll send horses for you.

795
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:55,400
Stay with the Hobbits -
I'll send horses for you.

796
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,300
I'm the faster rider - I'll take him

797
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,300
I'm the faster rider - I'll take him

798
01:19:58,300 --> 01:19:59,600
The Road is too dangerous.

799
01:19:58,300 --> 01:19:59,600
The Road is too dangerous.

800
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:01,000
What are they saying?

801
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:03,200
If I can get across the river...

802
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:03,200
If I can get across the river...

803
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:06,000
...the power of my people
will protect him.

804
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:06,000
...the power of my people
will protect him.

805
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,700
I do not fear them.

806
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:19,900
Arwen...

807
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:23,300
...ride hard. Don't look back.

808
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:32,600
What are you doing?!
Those Wraiths are still out there!

809
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:30,000
Give up the halfling, She-Elf.

810
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:33,500
If you want him, come and claim him.

811
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:29,900
No. No!

812
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:35,500
Frodo, no.

813
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:38,000
Frodo, don't give in.

814
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:40,200
Not now.

815
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:53,600
<i>What grace is given</i> me...

816
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:56,100
<i>...let it pass to him.</i>

817
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,500
<i>Let him be spared.</i>

818
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:01,100
<i>Save him.</i>

819
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:18,600
- Where am I?
- You are in the house of Elrond.

820
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:25,400
And it is 10:00 in the morning
on October 24th, if you want to know.

821
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:31,300
- Gandalf!
- Yes, I'm here.

822
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:36,100
And you're lucky to be here too.

823
01:24:36,900 --> 01:24:40,800
A few more hours and you
would have been beyond our aid.

824
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:45,000
But you have some strength in you,
my dear Hobbit.

825
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:55,200
What happened, Gandalf?

826
01:24:56,300 --> 01:25:01,500
- Why didn't you meet us?
- I am sorry, Frodo.

827
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:08,100
I was delayed.

828
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:13,100
A friendship with Saruman
is not lightly thrown aside.

829
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:21,900
One ill turn deserves another.
It is over.

830
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:25,000
Embrace the power of the Ring...

831
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:28,200
...or embrace your own destruction!

832
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:34,300
There is only one Lord of the Ring.

833
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:38,500
Only one who can bend it to his will.

834
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:43,300
And he does not share power.

835
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:01,000
So you have chosen death.

836
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:14,800
Gandalf? What is it?

837
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,700
Nothing, Frodo.

838
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:20,300
Frodo!

839
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:24,100
- Sam.
- Bless you, you're awake!

840
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:27,000
Sam has hardly left your side.

841
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:29,400
We were that worried about you.
Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?

842
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:34,800
By the skills of Lord Elrond,
you're beginning to mend.

843
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:39,900
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

844
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:31,300
- Bilbo!
- Hello, Frodo, my lad.

845
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,200
Bilbo.

846
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:40,000
<i>"There and Back Again:</i>

847
01:27:40,300 --> 01:27:43,000
<i>A Hobbit's Tale,</i> by Bilbo Baggins."

848
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:49,500
- This is wonderful.
- I meant to go back...

849
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:53,700
...wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...

850
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:56,400
...visit Lake-town...

851
01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:00,000
...see the Lonely Mountain again.

852
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:05,300
But age, it seems,
has finally caught up with me.

853
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:19,400
I miss the Shire.

854
01:28:19,900 --> 01:28:24,800
I spent all my childhood pretending
I was off somewhere else.

855
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:28,700
Off with you,
on one of your adventures.

856
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:35,300
But my own adventure turned out
to be quite different.

857
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:43,700
I'm not like you, Bilbo.

858
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,200
My dear boy.

859
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:55,200
- Now, what have I forgotten?
- Packed already?

860
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:57,900
No harm in being prepared.

861
01:28:58,100 --> 01:29:00,600
- I thought you wanted to see the Elves.
- I do.

862
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:03,600
- More than anything.
- I did.

863
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,900
It's just...

864
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:09,200
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?

865
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:13,000
We got the Ring this far,
to Rivendell. And I thought...

866
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:16,600
...seeing as how you're on the mend,
we'd be off soon.

867
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:18,500
Off home.

868
01:29:22,700 --> 01:29:24,600
You are right, Sam.

869
01:29:26,900 --> 01:29:29,600
We did what we set out to do.

870
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:32,700
The Ring will be safe in Rivendell.

871
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:39,200
I am ready to go home.

872
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,900
His strength returns.

873
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:47,700
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.

874
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:51,000
And yet to have come so far
still bearing the Ring...

875
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:54,800
...the Hobbit has shown extraordinary
resilience to its evil.

876
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:58,500
It is a burden he should never
have had to bear.

877
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:04,000
- We can ask no more of Frodo.
- Gandalf, the enemy is moving.

878
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:08,900
Sauron's forces are massing in the East.
His Eye is fixed on Rivendell.

879
01:30:09,300 --> 01:30:11,900
And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.

880
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:15,400
Our list of allies grows thin.

881
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:18,900
His treachery runs deeper
than you know.

882
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:22,700
By foul craft, Saruman
has crossed Orcs with Goblin-men.

883
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:25,400
He's breeding an army
in the caverns of Isengard.

884
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:30,200
An army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed.

885
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:32,900
Saruman is coming for the Ring.

886
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:37,300
This evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the Elves.

887
01:30:37,700 --> 01:30:41,900
We do not have the strength
to fight both Mordor and Isengard!

888
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:46,900
Gandalf...

889
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:50,700
...the Ring cannot stay here.

890
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:13,500
<i>This peril belongs</i>
<i>to all Middle-earth.</i>

891
01:31:13,900 --> 01:31:16,500
<i>They must decide now how to end it.</i>

892
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:21,000
The time of the Elves is over.
My people are leaving these shores.

893
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:25,300
Who will you look to when we've gone?
The Dwarves?

894
01:31:25,700 --> 01:31:30,600
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.

895
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:35,100
It is in Men
that we must place our hope.

896
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:37,200
Men?

897
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:41,200
Men are weak.
The race of Men is failing.

898
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:45,800
The blood of Nmenor is all but spent,
its pride and dignity forgotten.

899
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:49,700
It is because of Men
the Ring survives.

900
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:51,600
I was there, Gandalf.

901
01:31:52,300 --> 01:31:55,000
<i>I was there 3000 years ago...</i>

902
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:04,200
<i>...when Isildur took the Ring.</i>

903
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:08,200
I was there the day
the strength of Men failed.

904
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,500
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.

905
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:18,700
<i>I led Isildur into the heart</i>
<i>of Mount Doom...</i>

906
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,400
<i>...where the Ring was forged,</i>
<i>the one place it could be destroyed.</i>

907
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:25,200
Cast it into the fire!

908
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:34,100
- Destroy it!
- No.

909
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:37,700
Isildur!

910
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:42,800
<i>It should have ended that day,</i>
<i>but evil was allowed to endure.</i>

911
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:51,200
Isildur kept the Ring.
The line of kings is broken.

912
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:55,800
There's no strength left
in the world of Men.

913
01:32:56,200 --> 01:33:00,800
- They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
- There is one who could unite them.

914
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:04,400
One who could reclaim
the throne of Gondor.

915
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:09,900
He turned from that path
a long time ago.

916
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:12,200
He has chosen exile.

917
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:45,300
You are no Elf.

918
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,600
Men of the South are welcome here.

919
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:51,700
- Who are you?
- I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.

920
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:56,000
Then we are here on common purpose...

921
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:57,800
...friend.

922
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:15,900
The shards of Narsil.

923
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:23,900
The blade that cut the Ring
from Sauron's hand.

924
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,100
It's still sharp.

925
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:41,000
But no more than a broken heirloom.

926
01:35:07,900 --> 01:35:10,800
Why do you fear the past?

927
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:17,000
You are Isildur's heir,
not Isildur himself.

928
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:20,700
You are not bound to his fate.

929
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:25,200
The same blood flows in my veins.

930
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:30,900
The same weakness.

931
01:35:33,700 --> 01:35:36,300
Your time will come.

932
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:40,900
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.

933
01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:46,600
The Shadow does not hold sway yet.

934
01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:46,600
The Shadow does not hold sway yet.

935
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:51,200
Not over you... not over me.

936
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:51,200
Not over you... not over me.

937
01:36:02,700 --> 01:36:05,800
Do you remember when we first met?

938
01:36:02,700 --> 01:36:05,800
Do you remember when we first met?

939
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:13,700
I thought I had strayed into a dream.

940
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:13,700
I thought I had strayed into a dream.

941
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:16,900
Long years have passed.

942
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:16,900
Long years have passed.

943
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:21,900
You did not have the cares you carry now.

944
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:21,900
You did not have the cares you carry now.

945
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:25,500
Do you remember what I told you?

946
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:25,500
Do you remember what I told you?

947
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:34,100
You said you'd bind yourself to me...

948
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:41,000
...forsaking the immortal life
of your people.

949
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:44,200
And to that I hold.

950
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:48,000
I would rather share
one lifetime with you...

951
01:36:48,300 --> 01:36:52,000
...than face all the Ages
of this world alone.

952
01:37:01,100 --> 01:37:04,400
I choose a mortal life.

953
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:09,800
- You cannot give me this.
- It is mine to give to whom I will...

954
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:15,600
...like my heart.

955
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:35,100
Strangers from distant lands,
friends of old...

956
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:39,300
...you've been summoned here
to answer the threat of Mordor.

957
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:44,700
Middle-earth stands upon the brink
of destruction. None can escape it.

958
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:48,600
You will unite, or you will fall.

959
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:53,000
Each race is bound to this fate,
this one doom.

960
01:37:55,100 --> 01:37:58,400
Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.

961
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:14,300
So it is true.

962
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:33,800
In a dream...

963
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:38,600
...I saw the eastern sky grow dark...

964
01:38:39,100 --> 01:38:40,700
...but in the West
a pale light lingered.

965
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:43,300
A voice was crying:

966
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:46,300
"Your doom is near at hand.

967
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:50,100
Isildur's Bane is found."

968
01:38:54,300 --> 01:38:56,000
Isildur's Bane.

969
01:38:56,700 --> 01:38:57,900
Boromir!

970
01:39:21,100 --> 01:39:24,700
Never before has any voice uttered the
words of that tongue here in Imladris.

971
01:39:25,100 --> 01:39:28,600
I do not ask your pardon,
Master Elrond...

972
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
...for the Black Speech of Mordor...

973
01:39:31,400 --> 01:39:32,700
...may yet be heard...

974
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,800
...in every corner of the West!

975
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:38,700
The Ring is altogether evil.

976
01:39:39,100 --> 01:39:40,600
It is a gift.

977
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:43,200
A gift to the foes of Mordor.

978
01:39:43,900 --> 01:39:45,900
Why not use this Ring?

979
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:48,900
Long has my father,
the Steward of Gondor...

980
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:53,300
...kept the forces of Mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people...

981
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:55,900
...are your lands kept safe.

982
01:39:57,800 --> 01:40:02,000
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.

983
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:06,000
You cannot wield it.
None of us can.

984
01:40:06,700 --> 01:40:10,600
The One Ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.

985
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:14,400
And what would a Ranger know
of this matter?

986
01:40:14,900 --> 01:40:16,800
This is no mere Ranger.

987
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:21,300
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

988
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,800
You owe him your allegiance.

989
01:40:28,900 --> 01:40:30,800
Aragorn.

990
01:40:32,700 --> 01:40:35,400
This is Isildur's heir?

991
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:40,400
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

992
01:40:42,700 --> 01:40:44,100
Sit down, Legolas.

993
01:40:42,700 --> 01:40:44,100
Sit down, Legolas.

994
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:50,200
Gondor has no king.

995
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:53,800
Gondor needs no king.

996
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:04,000
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

997
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:08,500
You have only one choice.

998
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,200
The Ring must be destroyed.

999
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:19,000
What are we waiting for?

1000
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:34,100
The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli,
son of Glin...

1001
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:38,500
...by any craft that we here possess.

1002
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:43,100
The Ring was made in the fires
of Mount Doom.

1003
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:47,200
Only there can it be unmade.

1004
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:50,900
It must be taken deep into Mordor...

1005
01:41:51,300 --> 01:41:56,000
...and cast back into the fiery chasm
from whence it came.

1006
01:41:58,200 --> 01:42:00,100
One of you...

1007
01:42:00,700 --> 01:42:02,800
...must do this.

1008
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:09,400
One does not simply walk into Mordor.

1009
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:13,900
Its Black Gates are guarded
by more than just Orcs.

1010
01:42:14,900 --> 01:42:18,900
There is evil there
that does not sleep.

1011
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:23,300
The Great Eye is ever-watchful.

1012
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:26,100
It is a barren wasteland...

1013
01:42:26,500 --> 01:42:29,900
...riddled with fire, and ash
and dust.

1014
01:42:30,300 --> 01:42:34,000
The very air you breathe
is a poisonous fume.

1015
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:38,500
Not with 10,000 men
could you do this. It is folly.

1016
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:43,100
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond
has said? The Ring must be destroyed.

1017
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:45,900
And I suppose you think
you are the one to do it!

1018
01:42:46,300 --> 01:42:50,700
And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

1019
01:42:51,100 --> 01:42:56,200
I will be dead before I see the Ring
in the hands of an Elf!

1020
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:00,800
Never trust an Elf!

1021
01:43:02,100 --> 01:43:07,700
Do you not understand? While you bicker
amongst yourselves, Sauron's power grows!

1022
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:11,000
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!

1023
01:43:29,900 --> 01:43:32,000
I will take it.

1024
01:43:34,100 --> 01:43:36,600
I will take it.

1025
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:45,400
I will take the Ring to Mordor.

1026
01:43:53,700 --> 01:43:54,800
Though...

1027
01:43:58,100 --> 01:43:59,800
...I do not know the way.

1028
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:05,900
I will help you bear
this burden, Frodo Baggins...

1029
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:09,600
...as long as it is yours to bear.

1030
01:44:10,900 --> 01:44:13,800
If by my life
or death I can protect you...

1031
01:44:14,700 --> 01:44:16,000
...I will.

1032
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:21,400
You have my sword.

1033
01:44:23,300 --> 01:44:25,300
And you have my bow.

1034
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,400
And my ax.

1035
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:38,400
You carry the fates
of us all, little one.

1036
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:44,000
If this is indeed
the will of the Council...

1037
01:44:44,700 --> 01:44:47,000
...then Gondor will see it done.

1038
01:44:49,700 --> 01:44:54,300
- Frodo's not going anywhere without me.
- It is hardly possible to separate you...

1039
01:44:54,700 --> 01:44:59,300
...even when he is summoned
to a secret Council and you are not.

1040
01:45:00,100 --> 01:45:01,900
We're coming too!

1041
01:45:04,100 --> 01:45:06,700
You'll have to send us home
tied up in a sack to stop us.

1042
01:45:07,100 --> 01:45:10,300
Anyway, you need people
of intelligence on this sort of...

1043
01:45:10,700 --> 01:45:11,900
...mission.

1044
01:45:12,300 --> 01:45:13,600
Quest.

1045
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:15,200
Thing.

1046
01:45:17,100 --> 01:45:19,700
Well, that rules you out, Pip.

1047
01:45:21,400 --> 01:45:23,200
Nine companions.

1048
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:26,800
So be it.

1049
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:30,100
You shall be
the Fellowship of the Ring.

1050
01:45:30,900 --> 01:45:32,700
Great!

1051
01:45:33,100 --> 01:45:35,300
Where are we going?

1052
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,400
She wanted to protect her child...

1053
01:46:15,300 --> 01:46:18,900
she thought in Rivendell
you would be safe.

1054
01:46:21,300 --> 01:46:24,600
In her heart, your mother knew
you'd be hunted all your life.

1055
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:26,800
That you'd never escape your fate.

1056
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:30,900
The skill of the Elves
can reforge the sword of kings...

1057
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:35,300
...but only you have the power
to wield it.

1058
01:46:36,500 --> 01:46:38,800
I do not want that power.

1059
01:46:39,100 --> 01:46:41,700
I have never wanted it.

1060
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:45,600
You are the last of that bloodline.
There is no other.

1061
01:46:50,300 --> 01:46:52,500
My old sword! Sting.

1062
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:53,900
Here, take it. Take it.

1063
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:03,100
- It's so light.
- Yes. Made by the Elves, you know.

1064
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:08,000
The blade glows blue
when Orcs are close.

1065
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:12,800
And it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

1066
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:15,600
Here's a pretty thing.

1067
01:47:16,100 --> 01:47:17,300
Mithril.

1068
01:47:18,200 --> 01:47:22,400
As light as a feather,
and as hard as dragon scales.

1069
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:25,900
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

1070
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
My old ring.

1071
01:47:37,400 --> 01:47:41,100
I should very much like...

1072
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:45,300
...to hold it again, one last time.

1073
01:48:02,900 --> 01:48:06,400
I'm sorry I brought this upon you,
my boy.

1074
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:10,800
I'm sorry that you
must carry this burden.

1075
01:48:15,500 --> 01:48:18,400
I'm sorry for everything.

1076
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:37,600
The Ring-bearer is setting out
on the Quest of Mount Doom.

1077
01:48:39,100 --> 01:48:41,600
On you who travel with him,
no oath...

1078
01:48:41,900 --> 01:48:44,900
...nor bond is laid to go further
than you will.

1079
01:48:48,500 --> 01:48:50,900
Farewell. Hold to your purpose.

1080
01:48:51,500 --> 01:48:55,200
May the blessings of Elves and Men...

1081
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,500
...and all Free Folk go with you.

1082
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:05,500
The Fellowship awaits the Ring-bearer.

1083
01:49:24,100 --> 01:49:26,500
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?

1084
01:49:27,200 --> 01:49:29,000
Left.

1085
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:52,900
<i>We must hold to this course, west</i>
<i>of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.</i>

1086
01:50:53,300 --> 01:50:56,900
<i>If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan</i>
<i>will still be open to us.</i>

1087
01:50:57,200 --> 01:51:00,600
<i>From there, our road</i>
<i>turns east to Mordor.</i>

1088
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:04,600
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

1089
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:07,600
Move your feet.

1090
01:51:07,900 --> 01:51:09,100
- You look good, Pippin.
- Thanks.

1091
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:10,700
Faster!

1092
01:51:12,100 --> 01:51:15,700
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which I note they're not...

1093
01:51:16,100 --> 01:51:18,800
...I'd say we were taking
the long way 'round.

1094
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:22,300
Gandalf, we could pass through
the Mines of Moria.

1095
01:51:23,100 --> 01:51:26,800
My cousin Balin would give us
a royal welcome.

1096
01:51:27,100 --> 01:51:32,300
No, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.

1097
01:51:41,700 --> 01:51:42,800
Sorry!

1098
01:51:43,600 --> 01:51:45,100
Get him!

1099
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:48,900
- For the Shire!
- Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!

1100
01:51:49,700 --> 01:51:51,900
Gentlemen, that's enough.

1101
01:51:55,700 --> 01:51:57,300
You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!

1102
01:51:57,800 --> 01:52:00,300
- What is that?
- Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

1103
01:52:00,700 --> 01:52:03,200
It's moving fast.

1104
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:05,700
Against the wind.

1105
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:08,600
- Crebain from Dunland!
- Hide!

1106
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:11,500
- Hurry!
- Take cover!

1107
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,600
Spies of Saruman.

1108
01:52:47,500 --> 01:52:50,600
The passage south is being watched.

1109
01:52:51,900 --> 01:52:55,100
We must take the Pass of Caradhras.

1110
01:53:07,900 --> 01:53:09,600
Frodo!

1111
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:30,800
Boromir.

1112
01:53:31,100 --> 01:53:35,100
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt...

1113
01:53:35,500 --> 01:53:38,500
...over so small a thing.

1114
01:53:41,800 --> 01:53:43,700
Such a little thing.

1115
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:45,400
Boromir!

1116
01:53:46,100 --> 01:53:48,600
Give the Ring to Frodo.

1117
01:53:58,600 --> 01:54:00,500
As you wish.

1118
01:54:01,300 --> 01:54:03,300
I care not.

1119
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:43,300
So, Gandalf, you try
to lead them over Caradhras.

1120
01:54:43,700 --> 01:54:48,100
And if that fails,
where then will you go?

1121
01:54:49,600 --> 01:54:52,400
<i>If the mountain defeats you...</i>

1122
01:54:52,700 --> 01:54:57,000
<i>...will you risk</i>
<i>a more dangerous road?</i>

1123
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:12,300
There is a fell voice on the air.

1124
01:55:13,600 --> 01:55:15,000
It's Saruman!

1125
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:28,400
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!

1126
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:30,600
No!

1127
01:56:37,100 --> 01:56:38,900
We must get off the mountain!

1128
01:56:39,400 --> 01:56:43,600
Make for the Gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!

1129
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:47,200
The Gap of Rohan takes us
too close to Isengard!

1130
01:56:47,500 --> 01:56:51,100
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

1131
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:54,200
Let us go through the Mines of Moria.

1132
01:56:56,200 --> 01:56:59,800
<i>Moria. You fear to go</i>
<i>into those mines.</i>

1133
01:57:00,600 --> 01:57:05,400
The Dwarves delved too greedily
and too deep.

1134
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:11,100
<i>You know what they awoke</i>
<i>in the darkness of Khazad-dm:</i>

1135
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:15,900
Shadow and flame.

1136
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:22,100
Let the Ring-bearer decide.

1137
01:57:26,900 --> 01:57:28,900
We cannot stay here!

1138
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:31,800
This will be the death of the Hobbits.

1139
01:57:32,200 --> 01:57:33,700
Frodo?

1140
01:57:36,900 --> 01:57:39,600
We will go through the mines.

1141
01:57:40,600 --> 01:57:42,400
So be it.

1142
01:57:49,100 --> 01:57:52,800
Frodo, come and help an old man.

1143
01:57:56,500 --> 01:57:58,600
How is your shoulder?

1144
01:57:58,900 --> 01:58:02,000
- Better than it was.
- And the Ring?

1145
01:58:03,700 --> 01:58:06,100
You feel its power growing, don't you?

1146
01:58:06,700 --> 01:58:09,500
I've felt it too.
You must be careful now.

1147
01:58:10,100 --> 01:58:13,800
Evil will be drawn to you
from outside the Fellowship.

1148
01:58:14,100 --> 01:58:16,600
And, I fear, from within.

1149
01:58:19,400 --> 01:58:23,300
- Who then do I trust?
- You must trust yourself.

1150
01:58:23,700 --> 01:58:26,400
Trust your own strengths.

1151
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:29,200
- What do you mean?
- There are many powers in this world...

1152
01:58:29,500 --> 01:58:31,500
...for good or for evil.

1153
01:58:31,800 --> 01:58:34,000
Some are greater than I am.

1154
01:58:34,600 --> 01:58:38,100
And against some I have not yet
been tested.

1155
01:58:39,600 --> 01:58:40,900
The walls...

1156
01:58:41,700 --> 01:58:43,700
...of Moria.

1157
01:58:49,500 --> 01:58:52,300
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

1158
01:58:52,700 --> 01:58:56,900
Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot find
them if their secrets are forgotten.

1159
01:58:57,500 --> 01:58:59,800
Why doesn't that surprise me?

1160
01:59:07,900 --> 01:59:11,100
Well, let's see.

1161
01:59:11,500 --> 01:59:12,800
Ithildin.

1162
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:16,800
It mirrors only starlight
and moonlight.

1163
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:34,900
It reads, "The Doors of Durin,
Lord of Moria.

1164
01:59:35,700 --> 01:59:40,100
- Speak, friend, and enter."
- What do you suppose that means?

1165
01:59:40,500 --> 01:59:45,000
It's simple. If you are a friend, you speak
the password and the doors will open.

1166
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:10,000
Nothing's happening.

1167
02:00:17,200 --> 02:00:21,200
I once knew every spell
in all the tongues of Elves...

1168
02:00:21,600 --> 02:00:24,200
...Men and Orcs.

1169
02:00:24,700 --> 02:00:25,900
What are you going to do, then?

1170
02:00:26,100 --> 02:00:28,200
Knock your head against these doors,
Peregrin Took!

1171
02:00:28,600 --> 02:00:30,500
And if that does not shatter them...

1172
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:33,300
...and I am allowed a little peace
from foolish questions...

1173
02:00:33,600 --> 02:00:36,900
...I will try to find the opening words.

1174
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,400
Mines are no place for a pony.

1175
02:00:52,800 --> 02:00:56,700
- Even one so brave as Bill.
- Bye-bye, Bill.

1176
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,700
Go on, Bill. Go on.

1177
02:01:01,400 --> 02:01:04,800
Don't worry, Sam,
he knows the way home.

1178
02:01:11,800 --> 02:01:14,200
Do not disturb the water.

1179
02:01:14,500 --> 02:01:16,300
Oh, it's useless.

1180
02:01:29,100 --> 02:01:31,200
It's a riddle.

1181
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:37,000
"Speak 'friend' and enter."

1182
02:01:37,500 --> 02:01:40,300
What's the Elvish word for "friend"?

1183
02:01:41,800 --> 02:01:43,100
<i>Mellon.</i>

1184
02:02:01,200 --> 02:02:05,900
Soon, Master Elf, you will enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves.

1185
02:02:06,500 --> 02:02:12,000
Roaring fires, malt beer,
ripe meat off the bone!

1186
02:02:13,700 --> 02:02:16,700
This, my friend,
is the home of my cousin Balin.

1187
02:02:17,200 --> 02:02:19,500
And they call it a mine.

1188
02:02:19,800 --> 02:02:21,700
A mine!

1189
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:26,000
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

1190
02:02:32,300 --> 02:02:33,800
No...

1191
02:02:35,100 --> 02:02:36,700
No!

1192
02:02:39,400 --> 02:02:40,900
Goblins.

1193
02:02:44,900 --> 02:02:49,000
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.

1194
02:02:50,200 --> 02:02:52,700
Now, get out of here. Get out!

1195
02:02:55,600 --> 02:02:57,800
- Frodo!
- Help!

1196
02:02:58,100 --> 02:02:59,600
Strider!

1197
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,600
- Help!
- Get off him!

1198
02:03:02,900 --> 02:03:03,900
Aragorn!

1199
02:03:14,400 --> 02:03:15,400
Frodo!

1200
02:03:41,700 --> 02:03:42,700
Into the mines!

1201
02:03:42,900 --> 02:03:46,000
- Legolas!
- Into the cave!

1202
02:03:50,500 --> 02:03:52,200
Run!

1203
02:04:09,100 --> 02:04:12,500
We now have but one choice.

1204
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:17,600
We must face the long dark of Moria.

1205
02:04:18,100 --> 02:04:19,900
Be on your guard.

1206
02:04:20,300 --> 02:04:23,500
There are older
and fouler things than Orcs...

1207
02:04:23,800 --> 02:04:27,200
...in the deep places of the world.

1208
02:04:35,400 --> 02:04:39,100
Quietly now. It's a four-day journey
to the other side.

1209
02:04:39,500 --> 02:04:43,200
Let us hope that our presence
may go unnoticed.

1210
02:05:29,100 --> 02:05:32,600
The wealth of Moria was not in gold...

1211
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,200
...or jewels...

1212
02:05:35,500 --> 02:05:38,400
...but mithril.

1213
02:05:57,000 --> 02:06:01,600
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings
that Thorin gave him.

1214
02:06:02,100 --> 02:06:05,800
- Oh, that was a kingly gift.
- Yes.

1215
02:06:06,200 --> 02:06:08,000
I never told him...

1216
02:06:08,300 --> 02:06:13,100
...but its worth was greater than
the value of the Shire.

1217
02:06:25,600 --> 02:06:27,300
Pippin.

1218
02:06:47,700 --> 02:06:50,500
I have no memory of this place.

1219
02:06:52,700 --> 02:06:54,000
- Are we lost?
- No.

1220
02:06:54,400 --> 02:06:56,800
- I think we are.
- Gandalf's thinking.

1221
02:06:57,100 --> 02:06:58,500
- Merry?
- What?

1222
02:06:58,700 --> 02:07:00,500
I'm hungry.

1223
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:16,300
- There's something down there.
- It's Gollum.

1224
02:07:16,700 --> 02:07:20,600
- Gollum?
- He's been following us for three days.

1225
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:24,900
- He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dr?
- Escaped...

1226
02:07:25,800 --> 02:07:27,400
...or was set loose.

1227
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:31,500
Now the Ring has brought him here.

1228
02:07:34,300 --> 02:07:36,900
He will never be rid of his need for it.

1229
02:07:37,300 --> 02:07:42,700
He hates and loves the Ring,
as he hates and loves himself.

1230
02:07:43,100 --> 02:07:47,700
Smagol's life is a sad story.

1231
02:07:48,100 --> 02:07:53,800
Yes, Smagol he was once called.
Before the Ring found him.

1232
02:07:55,100 --> 02:07:57,700
Before it drove him mad.

1233
02:07:58,200 --> 02:08:00,900
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance.

1234
02:08:01,300 --> 02:08:02,400
Pity?

1235
02:08:03,500 --> 02:08:06,300
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

1236
02:08:07,300 --> 02:08:12,300
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

1237
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,300
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

1238
02:08:18,900 --> 02:08:22,700
Do not be too eager
to deal out death and judgment.

1239
02:08:23,100 --> 02:08:25,900
Even the very wise
cannot see all ends.

1240
02:08:26,500 --> 02:08:32,200
My heart tells me that Gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...

1241
02:08:33,300 --> 02:08:36,000
...before this is over.

1242
02:08:37,700 --> 02:08:41,300
The pity of Bilbo
may rule the fate of many.

1243
02:08:48,200 --> 02:08:51,300
I wish the Ring
had never come to me.

1244
02:08:52,900 --> 02:08:54,900
I wish none of this had happened.

1245
02:08:55,200 --> 02:09:00,000
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.

1246
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:06,200
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

1247
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:11,800
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

1248
02:09:12,400 --> 02:09:14,700
Bilbo was meant to find the Ring.

1249
02:09:15,300 --> 02:09:19,400
In which case,
you also were meant to have it.

1250
02:09:19,900 --> 02:09:22,900
And that is an encouraging thought.

1251
02:09:27,900 --> 02:09:29,700
It's that way.

1252
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,200
- He's remembered.
- No.

1253
02:09:32,500 --> 02:09:36,100
But the air doesn't smell
so foul down here.

1254
02:09:36,600 --> 02:09:41,500
If in doubt, Meriadoc,
always follow your nose.

1255
02:09:56,600 --> 02:10:00,500
Let me risk a little more light.

1256
02:10:05,300 --> 02:10:07,300
Behold...

1257
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:12,800
...the great realm
and Dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.

1258
02:10:15,600 --> 02:10:18,900
There's an eye opener, and no mistake.

1259
02:10:43,900 --> 02:10:45,500
Gimli!

1260
02:10:53,100 --> 02:10:54,600
No!

1261
02:10:57,300 --> 02:11:00,300
Oh, no.

1262
02:11:02,300 --> 02:11:03,500
No.

1263
02:11:10,800 --> 02:11:12,700
"Here lies Balin...

1264
02:11:13,300 --> 02:11:15,200
...son of Fundin...

1265
02:11:15,600 --> 02:11:18,100
...Lord of Moria."

1266
02:11:19,300 --> 02:11:20,900
He is dead, then.

1267
02:11:22,700 --> 02:11:24,300
It's as I feared.

1268
02:11:42,600 --> 02:11:45,400
We must move on. We cannot linger.

1269
02:11:45,700 --> 02:11:50,200
"They have taken the bridge
and the second hall.

1270
02:11:51,500 --> 02:11:54,000
We have barred the gates...

1271
02:11:54,800 --> 02:11:57,100
...but cannot hold them for long.

1272
02:11:57,400 --> 02:12:00,100
The ground shakes.

1273
02:12:00,600 --> 02:12:02,100
Drums...

1274
02:12:02,600 --> 02:12:05,800
...drums in the deep.

1275
02:12:09,600 --> 02:12:11,500
We cannot get out.

1276
02:12:13,600 --> 02:12:17,300
A Shadow moves in the dark.

1277
02:12:19,100 --> 02:12:21,600
We cannot get out.

1278
02:12:24,700 --> 02:12:26,500
They are coming."

1279
02:13:09,700 --> 02:13:11,400
Fool of a Took!

1280
02:13:11,800 --> 02:13:15,400
Throw yourself in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity.

1281
02:13:41,700 --> 02:13:43,300
Frodo!

1282
02:13:45,700 --> 02:13:47,000
Orcs.

1283
02:13:54,200 --> 02:13:56,100
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

1284
02:14:03,300 --> 02:14:05,100
They have a cave-troll.

1285
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:22,100
Let them come!

1286
02:14:22,600 --> 02:14:26,000
There is one Dwarf yet in Moria
who still draws breath.

1287
02:16:45,300 --> 02:16:48,000
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

1288
02:16:52,800 --> 02:16:54,500
Frodo!

1289
02:17:28,100 --> 02:17:29,900
Aragorn! Aragorn!

1290
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:32,800
Frodo!

1291
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:19,800
Frodo!

1292
02:19:20,200 --> 02:19:21,400
Oh, no.

1293
02:19:29,800 --> 02:19:31,600
He's alive.

1294
02:19:34,200 --> 02:19:37,000
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

1295
02:19:37,400 --> 02:19:39,500
You should be dead.

1296
02:19:39,800 --> 02:19:42,200
That spear would have skewered
a wild boar.

1297
02:19:42,500 --> 02:19:47,100
I think there's more to this Hobbit
than meets the eye.

1298
02:19:53,100 --> 02:19:54,100
Mithril.

1299
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,500
You are full of surprises,
Master Baggins.

1300
02:20:05,600 --> 02:20:07,400
To the Bridge of Khazad-dm!

1301
02:20:22,600 --> 02:20:24,100
This way!

1302
02:21:34,500 --> 02:21:37,400
What is this new devilry?

1303
02:21:53,600 --> 02:21:56,300
A Balrog.

1304
02:21:56,700 --> 02:21:59,700
A demon of the ancient world.

1305
02:22:02,100 --> 02:22:04,400
This foe is beyond any of you.

1306
02:22:05,700 --> 02:22:07,200
Run!

1307
02:22:14,600 --> 02:22:16,100
Quickly!

1308
02:22:32,700 --> 02:22:33,900
Gandalf.

1309
02:22:34,600 --> 02:22:36,100
Lead them on, Aragorn.

1310
02:22:37,600 --> 02:22:40,000
The bridge is near.

1311
02:22:42,200 --> 02:22:46,100
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.

1312
02:23:15,400 --> 02:23:17,000
Gandalf!

1313
02:23:35,500 --> 02:23:36,600
Merry! Pippin!

1314
02:23:47,800 --> 02:23:49,300
Sam!

1315
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:55,100
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.

1316
02:23:58,300 --> 02:23:59,700
Not the beard!

1317
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:14,800
Steady.

1318
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:18,600
Hold on!

1319
02:24:39,700 --> 02:24:40,800
Hang on!

1320
02:24:51,700 --> 02:24:53,300
Lean forward!

1321
02:24:56,400 --> 02:24:57,400
Steady.

1322
02:24:58,800 --> 02:24:59,900
Come on!

1323
02:25:00,100 --> 02:25:01,500
Now!

1324
02:25:18,800 --> 02:25:20,600
Over the bridge!

1325
02:25:20,900 --> 02:25:22,400
Fly!

1326
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:08,900
You cannot pass!

1327
02:26:09,200 --> 02:26:10,700
Gandalf!

1328
02:26:15,100 --> 02:26:19,800
I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

1329
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:24,600
The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udn!

1330
02:26:34,800 --> 02:26:36,600
Go back to the Shadow.

1331
02:26:44,600 --> 02:26:48,800
You shall not pass!

1332
02:27:16,200 --> 02:27:19,900
- No! No!
- Gandalf!

1333
02:27:27,700 --> 02:27:30,000
Fly, you fools!

1334
02:27:34,300 --> 02:27:36,300
No!

1335
02:27:42,500 --> 02:27:44,600
Aragorn!

1336
02:28:42,100 --> 02:28:44,700
Legolas, get them up.

1337
02:28:48,900 --> 02:28:50,700
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

1338
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:54,400
By nightfall, these hills will
be swarming with Orcs.

1339
02:28:54,900 --> 02:28:58,000
We must reach the woods of Lothlrien.

1340
02:28:59,100 --> 02:29:02,300
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.

1341
02:29:03,900 --> 02:29:06,000
On your feet, Sam.

1342
02:29:06,500 --> 02:29:07,900
Frodo?

1343
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:11,600
Frodo!

1344
02:30:04,200 --> 02:30:06,600
Stay close, young Hobbits!

1345
02:30:07,400 --> 02:30:11,400
They say that a great sorceress
lives in these woods.

1346
02:30:11,800 --> 02:30:14,200
An Elf-witch...

1347
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,700
...of terrible power.

1348
02:30:18,300 --> 02:30:20,400
All who look upon her...

1349
02:30:20,800 --> 02:30:22,500
...fall under her spell.

1350
02:30:22,800 --> 02:30:24,000
<i>Frodo!</i>

1351
02:30:26,300 --> 02:30:28,200
And are never seen again.

1352
02:30:28,500 --> 02:30:32,800
<i>Your coming to us is</i>
<i>as the footsteps of doom.</i>

1353
02:30:33,300 --> 02:30:36,800
<i>You bring great evil here,</i>
<i>Ring-bearer.</i>

1354
02:30:37,200 --> 02:30:38,900
Mr. Frodo?

1355
02:30:44,300 --> 02:30:49,600
Well, here's one Dwarf
she won't ensnare so easily.

1356
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:54,400
I have the eyes of a hawk
and the ears of a fox.

1357
02:31:02,300 --> 02:31:06,600
The Dwarf breathes so loud,
we could have shot him in the dark.

1358
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:13,900
Welcome Legolas, son of Thranduil.

1359
02:31:14,900 --> 02:31:17,400
Our Fellowship stands in your debt.

1360
02:31:20,300 --> 02:31:21,900
Aragorn of the Dunedain...

1361
02:31:22,700 --> 02:31:24,000
you are known to us.

1362
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,100
So much for the legendary courtesy
of the Elves!

1363
02:31:27,400 --> 02:31:29,200
Speak words we can all understand!

1364
02:31:29,500 --> 02:31:33,900
We have not had dealings
with the Dwarves since the Dark Days.

1365
02:31:34,400 --> 02:31:36,800
And you know what this Dwarf
says to that?

1366
02:31:43,800 --> 02:31:45,600
That was not so courteous.

1367
02:31:52,200 --> 02:31:56,100
You bring great evil with you.

1368
02:31:58,100 --> 02:32:00,200
You can go no further.

1369
02:32:37,700 --> 02:32:40,200
Gandalf's death was not in vain.

1370
02:32:41,400 --> 02:32:43,200
Nor would he have you give up hope.

1371
02:32:44,900 --> 02:32:48,000
You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.

1372
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,900
Don't carry the weight of the dead.

1373
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:56,900
You will follow me.

1374
02:33:08,700 --> 02:33:10,500
Caras Galadhon.

1375
02:33:11,300 --> 02:33:14,000
The heart of Elvendom on earth.

1376
02:33:14,500 --> 02:33:19,900
Realm of the Lord Celeborn
and of Galadriel, Lady of Light.

1377
02:34:39,200 --> 02:34:42,100
The enemy knows you have entered here.

1378
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:47,900
What hope you had in secrecy
is now gone.

1379
02:34:49,900 --> 02:34:54,100
Eight there are here, yet nine there
were set out from Rivendell.

1380
02:34:54,600 --> 02:34:56,300
Tell me, where is Gandalf?

1381
02:34:56,500 --> 02:34:59,500
For I much desire to speak with him.

1382
02:34:59,900 --> 02:35:02,500
I can no longer see him from afar.

1383
02:35:03,500 --> 02:35:08,400
Gandalf the Grey did not pass
the borders of this land.

1384
02:35:08,900 --> 02:35:11,200
He has fallen into Shadow.

1385
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:20,300
He was taken by both Shadow and flame.

1386
02:35:22,300 --> 02:35:25,800
A Balrog of Morgoth.

1387
02:35:26,700 --> 02:35:29,900
For we went needlessly
into the net of Moria.

1388
02:35:32,200 --> 02:35:35,300
Needless were none of the deeds
of Gandalf in life.

1389
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:39,100
We do not yet know his full purpose.

1390
02:35:44,100 --> 02:35:48,200
Do not let the great emptiness
of Khazad-dm fill your heart...

1391
02:35:48,600 --> 02:35:50,900
...Gimli, son of Glin.

1392
02:35:51,900 --> 02:35:55,300
For the world has grown
full of peril...

1393
02:35:56,900 --> 02:35:59,400
...and in all lands...

1394
02:35:59,800 --> 02:36:03,100
...Iove is now mingled with grief.

1395
02:36:15,900 --> 02:36:18,500
What now becomes of this Fellowship?

1396
02:36:19,200 --> 02:36:22,000
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.

1397
02:36:25,200 --> 02:36:28,300
The quest stands upon the edge
of a knife.

1398
02:36:28,600 --> 02:36:31,500
Stray but a little and it will fail...

1399
02:36:32,400 --> 02:36:35,100
...to the ruin of all.

1400
02:36:39,600 --> 02:36:45,100
Yet hope remains
while the Company is true.

1401
02:36:46,900 --> 02:36:51,500
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Go now and rest...

1402
02:36:52,200 --> 02:36:55,700
...for you are weary with sorrow
and much toil.

1403
02:36:58,100 --> 02:37:00,100
Tonight, you will sleep...

1404
02:37:00,500 --> 02:37:03,800
<i>Welcome, Frodo of the Shire...</i>

1405
02:37:05,400 --> 02:37:07,100
<i>...one who has seen the Eye!</i>

1406
02:37:21,800 --> 02:37:24,300
A lament for Gandalf.

1407
02:37:31,700 --> 02:37:33,100
What do they say about him?

1408
02:37:33,400 --> 02:37:35,900
I have not the heart to tell you.

1409
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,100
For me, the grief is still too near.

1410
02:37:44,200 --> 02:37:46,800
I bet they don't mention his fireworks.

1411
02:37:47,200 --> 02:37:50,100
There should be a verse about them.

1412
02:37:53,800 --> 02:37:55,700
<i>The finest rockets ever seen</i>

1413
02:37:56,900 --> 02:37:59,600
<i>They burst in stars of blue and green</i>

1414
02:38:00,600 --> 02:38:05,600
<i>Or after thunder, silver showers</i>

1415
02:38:06,600 --> 02:38:09,200
<i>Came falling like a rain of flowers</i>

1416
02:38:09,500 --> 02:38:13,200
Oh, that doesn't do them justice
by a long road.

1417
02:38:24,100 --> 02:38:26,700
Take some rest.

1418
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,500
These borders are well-protected.

1419
02:38:29,800 --> 02:38:32,200
I will find no rest here.

1420
02:38:35,300 --> 02:38:38,100
I heard her voice inside my head.

1421
02:38:38,600 --> 02:38:42,000
She spoke of my father
and the fall of Gondor.

1422
02:38:42,500 --> 02:38:47,700
She said to me,
"Even now there is hope left."

1423
02:38:49,200 --> 02:38:51,900
But I cannot see it.

1424
02:38:53,400 --> 02:38:55,800
It is long since we had any hope.

1425
02:39:06,100 --> 02:39:08,100
My father is a noble man.

1426
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,100
But his rule is failing...

1427
02:39:14,400 --> 02:39:16,900
...and our people lose faith.

1428
02:39:18,400 --> 02:39:21,700
He looks to me to make things right,
and I would do it.

1429
02:39:22,100 --> 02:39:25,500
I would see the glory
of Gondor restored.

1430
02:39:28,500 --> 02:39:31,300
Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?

1431
02:39:32,100 --> 02:39:34,000
The White Tower of Ecthelion.

1432
02:39:34,400 --> 02:39:38,000
Glimmering like a spike
of pearl and silver.

1433
02:39:38,900 --> 02:39:42,200
Its banners caught high
in the morning breeze.

1434
02:39:45,200 --> 02:39:47,100
Have you ever been called home...

1435
02:39:47,400 --> 02:39:51,100
...by the clear ringing
of silver trumpets?

1436
02:39:51,900 --> 02:39:55,000
I have seen the White City...

1437
02:39:55,500 --> 02:39:56,900
...Iong ago.

1438
02:39:57,900 --> 02:40:02,700
One day, our paths will lead us there.

1439
02:40:03,900 --> 02:40:06,700
And the tower guard
shall take up the call:

1440
02:40:07,300 --> 02:40:10,400
"The Lords of Gondor have returned."

1441
02:41:17,800 --> 02:41:20,200
Will you look into the mirror?

1442
02:41:20,500 --> 02:41:22,000
What will I see?

1443
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:27,200
Even the wisest cannot tell.

1444
02:41:28,200 --> 02:41:30,000
For the mirror...

1445
02:41:30,300 --> 02:41:32,700
...shows many things.

1446
02:41:35,800 --> 02:41:38,100
Things that were...

1447
02:41:38,400 --> 02:41:40,900
...things that are...

1448
02:41:41,800 --> 02:41:43,700
...and some things...

1449
02:41:47,300 --> 02:41:50,500
...that have not yet come to pass.

1450
02:43:13,200 --> 02:43:15,900
I know what it is you saw.

1451
02:43:18,500 --> 02:43:20,900
For it is also in my mind.

1452
02:43:22,800 --> 02:43:26,700
<i>It is what will come to pass</i>
<i>if you should fail.</i>

1453
02:43:29,200 --> 02:43:33,800
<i>The Fellowship is breaking.</i>
<i>It is already begun.</i>

1454
02:43:34,800 --> 02:43:37,900
<i>He will try to take the Ring.</i>

1455
02:43:38,200 --> 02:43:40,100
<i>You know of whom I speak.</i>

1456
02:43:41,200 --> 02:43:45,700
<i>One by one, it will destroy them all.</i>

1457
02:43:47,400 --> 02:43:49,800
<i>If you ask it of</i> me...

1458
02:43:50,200 --> 02:43:53,200
<i>...I will give you the One Ring.</i>

1459
02:43:54,400 --> 02:43:56,500
You offer it to me freely.

1460
02:44:01,100 --> 02:44:04,800
I do not deny that my heart
has greatly desired this.

1461
02:44:11,500 --> 02:44:14,600
In place of a Dark Lord,
you would have a queen...

1462
02:44:15,200 --> 02:44:18,800
...not dark but beautiful,
and terrible as the dawn!

1463
02:44:19,600 --> 02:44:22,500
Treacherous as the sea!

1464
02:44:23,100 --> 02:44:27,800
Stronger than the foundations
of the earth!

1465
02:44:28,600 --> 02:44:30,800
All shall love me...

1466
02:44:31,100 --> 02:44:33,800
...and despair.

1467
02:44:48,100 --> 02:44:52,200
I pass the test. I will diminish...

1468
02:44:52,600 --> 02:44:54,900
...and go into the West...

1469
02:44:55,300 --> 02:44:59,600
...and remain Galadriel.
- I cannot do this alone.

1470
02:45:03,400 --> 02:45:07,300
You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo.
To bear a Ring of Power...

1471
02:45:08,400 --> 02:45:09,900
...is to be alone.

1472
02:45:13,300 --> 02:45:15,900
This is Nenya,
the Ring of Adamant.

1473
02:45:16,200 --> 02:45:17,700
And I am its keeper.

1474
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:24,500
This task was appointed to you.

1475
02:45:25,700 --> 02:45:28,400
And if you do not find a way...

1476
02:45:29,800 --> 02:45:31,700
...no one will.

1477
02:45:32,200 --> 02:45:35,200
Then I know what I must do.

1478
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:37,100
It's just...

1479
02:45:40,500 --> 02:45:42,600
...I'm afraid to do it.

1480
02:45:46,200 --> 02:45:51,100
Even the smallest person can change
the course of the future.

1481
02:45:56,700 --> 02:46:02,200
Do you know how the Orcs
first came into being?

1482
02:46:03,200 --> 02:46:06,300
They were Elves once.

1483
02:46:07,700 --> 02:46:10,900
Taken by the Dark Powers...

1484
02:46:11,300 --> 02:46:14,300
...tortured and mutilated.

1485
02:46:14,700 --> 02:46:19,800
A ruined and terrible form of life.

1486
02:46:20,300 --> 02:46:22,000
And now...

1487
02:46:23,700 --> 02:46:25,400
...perfected.

1488
02:46:26,200 --> 02:46:29,300
My fighting Uruk-hai...

1489
02:46:31,400 --> 02:46:33,500
...whom do you serve?

1490
02:46:33,900 --> 02:46:36,200
Saruman!

1491
02:46:57,200 --> 02:47:00,400
Hunt them down. Do not stop
until they are found.

1492
02:47:00,800 --> 02:47:03,600
You do not know pain.
You do not know fear.

1493
02:47:03,900 --> 02:47:06,800
You will taste Man-flesh!

1494
02:47:12,200 --> 02:47:15,700
One of the halflings carries
something of great value.

1495
02:47:16,100 --> 02:47:20,200
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.

1496
02:47:22,100 --> 02:47:23,300
Kill the others.

1497
02:47:42,600 --> 02:47:47,900
Never before have we clad strangers
in the garb of our own people.

1498
02:47:49,200 --> 02:47:52,800
May these cloaks help shield you
from unfriendly eyes.

1499
02:48:00,200 --> 02:48:01,800
Lembas.

1500
02:48:02,100 --> 02:48:03,600
Elvish waybread.

1501
02:48:06,100 --> 02:48:09,000
One small bite is enough to fill
the stomach of a grown man.

1502
02:48:15,600 --> 02:48:17,400
How many did you eat?

1503
02:48:17,800 --> 02:48:19,300
Four.

1504
02:48:25,200 --> 02:48:27,700
<i>Every league you travel south,</i>
<i>the danger will increase.</i>

1505
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:31,900
<i>Mordor Orcs now hold the eastern shore</i>
<i>of the Anduin.</i>

1506
02:48:32,300 --> 02:48:34,700
<i>Nor will you find safety</i>
<i>on the western bank.</i>

1507
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:38,600
Strange creatures bearing the White Hand
have been seen on our borders.

1508
02:48:39,100 --> 02:48:43,900
Seldom do Orcs journey in the open
under the sun, yet these have done so.

1509
02:48:52,800 --> 02:48:55,200
You are being tracked.

1510
02:48:56,800 --> 02:49:01,200
By river you have the chance of outrunning
the enemy to the Falls of Rauros.

1511
02:49:18,700 --> 02:49:23,300
My gift for you, Legolas,
is a bow of the Galadhrim.

1512
02:49:23,700 --> 02:49:27,000
Worthy of the skill
of our woodland kin.

1513
02:49:32,500 --> 02:49:34,800
These are the daggers of the Noldorin.

1514
02:49:35,200 --> 02:49:39,000
They have already seen service in war.

1515
02:49:39,300 --> 02:49:41,500
Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.

1516
02:49:41,800 --> 02:49:44,900
<i>You will find your courage.</i>

1517
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:48,800
<i>And for you, Samwise Gamgee...</i>

1518
02:49:49,100 --> 02:49:51,500
...EIven rope made of hithlain.

1519
02:49:51,800 --> 02:49:53,900
Thank you, my lady.

1520
02:49:55,800 --> 02:49:59,000
Have you run out
of those nice, shiny daggers?

1521
02:50:05,600 --> 02:50:08,500
And what gift would a dwarf ask
of the Elves?

1522
02:50:08,800 --> 02:50:10,800
Nothing.

1523
02:50:11,500 --> 02:50:14,700
Except to look upon the lady
of the Galadhrim one last time...

1524
02:50:15,500 --> 02:50:20,500
...for she is more fair
than all the jewels beneath the earth.

1525
02:50:27,800 --> 02:50:29,200
Actually...

1526
02:50:29,600 --> 02:50:31,100
There was one thing.

1527
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:34,500
No, no, I couldn't.
It's quite impossible.

1528
02:50:34,800 --> 02:50:37,500
<i>Stupid to ask.</i>

1529
02:50:40,200 --> 02:50:42,100
<i>I have nothing greater to give...</i>

1530
02:50:42,500 --> 02:50:45,900
...than the gift you already bear.

1531
02:50:47,300 --> 02:50:48,300
For her love,

1532
02:50:49,600 --> 02:50:54,800
I fear the grace of Arwen Evenstar
will diminish.

1533
02:50:55,700 --> 02:50:58,900
I would have her leave these shores,

1534
02:51:00,600 --> 02:51:03,300
and be with her people.

1535
02:51:05,500 --> 02:51:10,900
I would have her take the ship to Valinor.

1536
02:51:11,500 --> 02:51:14,400
That choice is yet before her.

1537
02:51:15,300 --> 02:51:18,000
You have your own choice to make,
Aragorn.

1538
02:51:18,600 --> 02:51:24,100
To rise above the height of all
your fathers since the days of Elendil...

1539
02:51:24,500 --> 02:51:28,700
...or to fall into darkness
with all that is left of your kin.

1540
02:51:36,100 --> 02:51:37,400
Farewell.

1541
02:51:41,300 --> 02:51:44,500
There is much you have yet to do.

1542
02:51:51,200 --> 02:51:52,400
We shall not meet again...

1543
02:51:52,700 --> 02:51:54,000
Elessar.

1544
02:51:56,400 --> 02:51:59,400
<i>Farewell, Frodo Baggins.</i>

1545
02:51:59,900 --> 02:52:03,100
I give you the light of Erendil...

1546
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:06,200
...our most beloved star.

1547
02:52:15,500 --> 02:52:19,700
<i>May it be a light for you</i>
<i>in dark places...</i>

1548
02:52:20,100 --> 02:52:24,000
<i>...when all other lights go out.</i>

1549
02:52:33,200 --> 02:52:36,200
I have taken my worst wound
at this parting...

1550
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:41,100
...having looked my last upon that
which is fairest.

1551
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:45,200
Henceforth I will call nothing fair
unless it be her gift to me.

1552
02:52:45,600 --> 02:52:47,400
What was her gift?

1553
02:52:47,700 --> 02:52:52,400
I asked her for one hair
from her golden head.

1554
02:52:53,400 --> 02:52:56,100
She gave me three.

1555
02:54:38,500 --> 02:54:41,700
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

1556
02:54:45,600 --> 02:54:48,600
I had hoped we would lose him
on the river.

1557
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:52,100
But he's too clever a waterman.

1558
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:56,100
And if he alerts the enemy
to our whereabouts...

1559
02:54:56,500 --> 02:54:58,600
...it will make the crossing
even more dangerous.

1560
02:54:58,900 --> 02:55:00,900
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

1561
02:55:01,100 --> 02:55:04,000
- No, Sam.
- You haven't eaten anything all day.

1562
02:55:04,400 --> 02:55:07,400
You're not sleeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

1563
02:55:08,400 --> 02:55:11,200
- Mr. Frodo...
- I'm all right.

1564
02:55:11,700 --> 02:55:12,800
But you're not.

1565
02:55:13,100 --> 02:55:15,400
I'm here to help you.

1566
02:55:15,800 --> 02:55:17,400
I promised Gandalf that I would.

1567
02:55:23,500 --> 02:55:26,100
You can't help me, Sam.

1568
02:55:28,400 --> 02:55:30,100
Not this time.

1569
02:55:32,900 --> 02:55:35,000
Get some sleep.

1570
02:55:41,300 --> 02:55:43,400
Minas Tirith is the safer road.

1571
02:55:44,100 --> 02:55:46,700
You know that.
From there we can regroup.

1572
02:55:47,500 --> 02:55:49,600
Strike out for Mordor from a place
of strength.

1573
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:52,700
There is no strength in Gondor
that can avail us.

1574
02:55:53,400 --> 02:55:55,300
You were quick enough to trust
the Elves.

1575
02:55:57,200 --> 02:55:59,800
Have you so little faith
in your own people?

1576
02:56:00,300 --> 02:56:03,100
Yes, there is weakness.
There is frailty.

1577
02:56:03,400 --> 02:56:06,600
But there is courage also,
and honor to be found in Men.

1578
02:56:06,900 --> 02:56:09,000
But you will not see that.

1579
02:56:09,400 --> 02:56:10,800
You are afraid!

1580
02:56:11,100 --> 02:56:13,600
All your life, you have hidden
in the shadows.

1581
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:17,300
Scared of who you are,
of what you are.

1582
02:56:19,900 --> 02:56:24,100
I will not lead the Ring within
a hundred leagues of your city.

1583
02:56:36,100 --> 02:56:37,300
Frodo.

1584
02:56:39,200 --> 02:56:40,700
The Argonath.

1585
02:56:44,300 --> 02:56:47,800
Long have I desired
to look upon the kings of old.

1586
02:56:48,700 --> 02:56:50,500
My kin.

1587
02:58:09,600 --> 02:58:11,700
We cross the lake at nightfall.

1588
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:14,500
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

1589
02:58:14,800 --> 02:58:18,100
- We approach Mordor from the North.
- Oh, yes?

1590
02:58:18,700 --> 02:58:22,300
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil...

1591
02:58:22,700 --> 02:58:25,800
...an impassable labyrinth
of razor-sharp rocks.

1592
02:58:26,100 --> 02:58:29,100
And after that, it gets even better.

1593
02:58:29,700 --> 02:58:34,300
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

1594
02:58:34,800 --> 02:58:36,100
That is our road.

1595
02:58:37,700 --> 02:58:40,700
I suggest you take some rest
and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

1596
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:42,700
Recover my...

1597
02:58:45,800 --> 02:58:47,700
- We should leave now.
- No.

1598
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:52,200
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

1599
02:58:52,600 --> 02:58:55,900
It is not the eastern shore
that worries me.

1600
02:58:56,200 --> 02:59:00,100
A shadow and a threat
has been growing in my mind.

1601
02:59:00,800 --> 02:59:04,800
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

1602
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:11,700
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.

1603
02:59:12,400 --> 02:59:14,000
Where's Frodo?

1604
02:59:39,800 --> 02:59:41,600
None of us should wander alone.

1605
02:59:43,000 --> 02:59:45,000
You, least of all.

1606
02:59:45,400 --> 02:59:47,700
So much depends on you.

1607
02:59:48,900 --> 02:59:50,800
Frodo?

1608
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:00,500
I know why you seek solitude.

1609
03:00:01,300 --> 03:00:04,500
You suffer. I see it day by day.

1610
03:00:05,500 --> 03:00:08,400
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

1611
03:00:10,100 --> 03:00:12,700
There are other ways, Frodo.

1612
03:00:13,100 --> 03:00:16,700
- Other paths that we might take.
- I know what you would say.

1613
03:00:17,100 --> 03:00:20,700
It would seem like wisdom
but for the warning in my heart.

1614
03:00:21,100 --> 03:00:24,000
Warning? Against what?

1615
03:00:24,400 --> 03:00:26,400
We're all afraid, Frodo.

1616
03:00:26,700 --> 03:00:30,200
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

1617
03:00:30,600 --> 03:00:34,200
...don't you see that is madness?
- There is no other way.

1618
03:00:36,100 --> 03:00:39,300
I ask only for the strength
to defend my people!

1619
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:43,000
- Lf you would but lend me the Ring.
- No.

1620
03:00:44,300 --> 03:00:47,800
- Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
- You are not yourself.

1621
03:00:49,800 --> 03:00:53,000
What chance do you think you have?

1622
03:00:53,300 --> 03:00:57,800
They will find you.
They will take the Ring.

1623
03:00:58,200 --> 03:01:01,700
And you will beg for death
before the end!

1624
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:06,000
You fool!

1625
03:01:06,300 --> 03:01:10,100
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

1626
03:01:10,500 --> 03:01:13,200
It should be mine! Give it to me!

1627
03:01:13,500 --> 03:01:14,700
- Give it to me!
- No!

1628
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:16,700
- Give it to me!
- No.

1629
03:01:24,500 --> 03:01:26,400
I see your mind.

1630
03:01:26,700 --> 03:01:29,500
You will take the Ring to Sauron!

1631
03:01:29,900 --> 03:01:31,600
You will betray us!

1632
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:35,000
You'll go to your death,
and the death of us all!

1633
03:01:35,500 --> 03:01:39,000
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!

1634
03:01:46,300 --> 03:01:47,800
Frodo?

1635
03:01:52,100 --> 03:01:53,600
Frodo.

1636
03:01:57,600 --> 03:01:59,500
What have I done?

1637
03:01:59,900 --> 03:02:01,500
Please, Frodo.

1638
03:02:01,800 --> 03:02:04,400
Frodo, I'm sorry!

1639
03:02:53,100 --> 03:02:54,400
Frodo?

1640
03:02:55,700 --> 03:02:58,700
- It has taken Boromir.
- Where is the Ring?

1641
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:00,700
Stay away!

1642
03:03:01,200 --> 03:03:02,700
Frodo!

1643
03:03:05,100 --> 03:03:08,700
- I swore to protect you.
- Can you protect me from yourself?

1644
03:03:18,500 --> 03:03:20,900
Would you destroy it?

1645
03:03:26,000 --> 03:03:27,900
<i>Aragorn.</i>

1646
03:03:31,500 --> 03:03:33,700
<i>Aragorn.</i>

1647
03:03:35,500 --> 03:03:37,300
<i>Elessar.</i>

1648
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:48,300
I would have gone with you to the end.

1649
03:03:49,100 --> 03:03:51,800
Into the very fires of Mordor.

1650
03:03:55,200 --> 03:03:56,300
I know.

1651
03:03:58,900 --> 03:04:04,100
Look after the others. Especially Sam.
He will not understand.

1652
03:04:08,200 --> 03:04:09,800
Go, Frodo!

1653
03:04:12,800 --> 03:04:14,200
Run.

1654
03:04:14,600 --> 03:04:16,100
Run!

1655
03:04:40,800 --> 03:04:42,400
Mr. Frodo!

1656
03:04:51,700 --> 03:04:53,400
Find the halfling!

1657
03:04:55,200 --> 03:04:57,600
Find the halfling!

1658
03:05:01,100 --> 03:05:02,700
Elendil!

1659
03:05:09,300 --> 03:05:10,700
Aragorn, go!

1660
03:05:32,600 --> 03:05:33,800
Frodo!

1661
03:05:34,500 --> 03:05:36,000
Hide here. Quick!

1662
03:05:36,800 --> 03:05:38,100
Come on!

1663
03:05:40,600 --> 03:05:42,600
What's he doing?

1664
03:05:46,900 --> 03:05:48,800
He's leaving.

1665
03:05:53,700 --> 03:05:56,500
- No!
- Pippin!

1666
03:06:01,600 --> 03:06:03,800
Run, Frodo. Go on!

1667
03:06:04,400 --> 03:06:07,400
- Hey! Hey, you!
- Over here!

1668
03:06:07,900 --> 03:06:09,400
- Over here!
- This way!

1669
03:06:20,300 --> 03:06:22,600
- It's working!
- I know it's working! Run!

1670
03:07:18,100 --> 03:07:21,000
- The horn of Gondor.
- Boromir.

1671
03:08:04,200 --> 03:08:05,300
Run!

1672
03:11:36,900 --> 03:11:38,500
No.

1673
03:11:42,500 --> 03:11:45,400
- They took the little ones.
- Hold still.

1674
03:11:45,700 --> 03:11:47,700
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

1675
03:11:49,700 --> 03:11:51,100
I let Frodo go.

1676
03:11:51,800 --> 03:11:54,300
Then you did what I could not.

1677
03:11:55,400 --> 03:11:58,500
I tried to take the Ring from him.

1678
03:11:59,300 --> 03:12:03,300
- The Ring is beyond our reach now.
- Forgive me.

1679
03:12:03,700 --> 03:12:05,800
I did not see it.

1680
03:12:06,300 --> 03:12:09,300
- I have failed you all.
- No, Boromir.

1681
03:12:09,800 --> 03:12:12,300
You fought bravely.

1682
03:12:12,700 --> 03:12:15,200
You have kept your honor.

1683
03:12:15,900 --> 03:12:17,700
Leave it.

1684
03:12:18,100 --> 03:12:20,100
It is over.

1685
03:12:21,500 --> 03:12:26,500
The world of Men will fall.
And all will come to darkness...

1686
03:12:27,100 --> 03:12:30,000
...and my city to ruin.

1687
03:12:34,200 --> 03:12:36,800
I do not know what strength
is in my blood...

1688
03:12:37,100 --> 03:12:40,900
...but I swear to you,
I will not let the White City fall...

1689
03:12:42,100 --> 03:12:44,500
...nor our people fail.

1690
03:12:45,600 --> 03:12:46,900
Our people.

1691
03:12:50,800 --> 03:12:52,800
Our people.

1692
03:13:14,600 --> 03:13:17,500
I would have followed you, my brother.

1693
03:13:19,200 --> 03:13:21,100
My captain.

1694
03:13:23,800 --> 03:13:25,600
My king.

1695
03:13:45,400 --> 03:13:47,500
Be at peace...

1696
03:13:48,000 --> 03:13:49,900
...son of Gondor.

1697
03:14:06,500 --> 03:14:09,700
They will look for his coming
from the White Tower.

1698
03:14:10,300 --> 03:14:13,200
But he will not return.

1699
03:14:36,600 --> 03:14:38,500
Frodo!

1700
03:14:58,000 --> 03:15:01,200
<i>I wish the Ring had never come to me.</i>

1701
03:15:02,500 --> 03:15:05,300
<i>I wish none of this had happened.</i>

1702
03:15:08,500 --> 03:15:11,100
<i>So do all who live</i>
<i>to see such times...</i>

1703
03:15:11,400 --> 03:15:14,700
<i>...but that is not for them to decide.</i>

1704
03:15:15,200 --> 03:15:17,700
<i>All you have to decide...</i>

1705
03:15:18,000 --> 03:15:22,500
...is what to do with the time
that is given to you.

1706
03:15:51,500 --> 03:15:53,500
Frodo, no!

1707
03:15:54,100 --> 03:15:55,300
Frodo!

1708
03:15:56,200 --> 03:15:58,800
- Mr. Frodo!
- No, Sam.

1709
03:16:02,500 --> 03:16:04,300
Go back, Sam!

1710
03:16:04,900 --> 03:16:08,300
- I'm going to Mordor alone.
- Of course you are.

1711
03:16:08,700 --> 03:16:11,400
And I'm coming with you!

1712
03:16:12,100 --> 03:16:14,400
You can't swim!

1713
03:16:18,200 --> 03:16:19,800
Sam!

1714
03:16:25,500 --> 03:16:26,800
Sam!

1715
03:17:07,700 --> 03:17:10,300
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

1716
03:17:10,900 --> 03:17:15,000
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."

1717
03:17:16,300 --> 03:17:18,800
And I don't mean to.

1718
03:17:19,200 --> 03:17:21,200
I don't mean to.

1719
03:17:23,000 --> 03:17:24,800
Sam.

1720
03:17:40,000 --> 03:17:41,600
Come on.

1721
03:18:10,200 --> 03:18:14,500
Hurry! Frodo and Sam
have reached the eastern shore.

1722
03:18:29,600 --> 03:18:34,400
- You mean not to follow them.
- Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

1723
03:18:38,000 --> 03:18:42,600
Then it has all been in vain.
The Fellowship has failed.

1724
03:18:54,700 --> 03:18:57,700
Not if we hold true to each other.

1725
03:18:59,300 --> 03:19:03,500
We will not abandon Merry and Pippin
to torment and death.

1726
03:19:04,700 --> 03:19:09,700
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

1727
03:19:11,300 --> 03:19:13,200
We travel light.

1728
03:19:13,500 --> 03:19:15,300
Let us hunt some Orc.

1729
03:19:18,400 --> 03:19:20,300
Yes!

1730
03:19:39,400 --> 03:19:40,700
Mordor.

1731
03:19:41,500 --> 03:19:44,700
I hope the others find a safer road.

1732
03:19:45,800 --> 03:19:48,200
Strider will look after them.

1733
03:19:49,200 --> 03:19:52,500
I don't suppose
we'll ever see them again.

1734
03:19:53,000 --> 03:19:55,300
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

1735
03:19:55,600 --> 03:19:57,100
We may.

1736
03:19:59,200 --> 03:20:00,200
Sam...

1737
03:20:03,900 --> 03:20:06,400
...I'm glad you are with me.
