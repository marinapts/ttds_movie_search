1
00:01:58,148 --> 00:02:01,014
What's this war in the heart of nature?

2
00:02:04,186 --> 00:02:07,099
Why does nature vie with itself?

3
00:02:08,392 --> 00:02:10,880
The land contend with the sea?

4
00:02:22,301 --> 00:02:25,002
Is there an avenging power in nature?

5
00:02:28,089 --> 00:02:30,375
Not one power, but two?

6
00:04:22,026 --> 00:04:24,560
I remember my mother when she was dying.

7
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:27,977
Looked all shrunk up and grey.

8
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,431
I asked her if she was afraid.

9
00:04:35,936 --> 00:04:38,220
She just shook her head.

10
00:04:39,642 --> 00:04:42,425
I was afraid to touch the
death I seen in her.

11
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:49,172
I couldn't find nothing beautiful or uplifting
about her going back to God.

12
00:04:52,302 --> 00:04:56,458
I heard people talk about immortality,
but I ain't seen it.

13
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,338
I wondered how it'd be when I died.

14
00:06:09,092 --> 00:06:11,882
What it'd be like to
know that this breath now

15
00:06:11,883 --> 00:06:14,375
was the last one you
was ever gonna draw.

16
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,826
I just hope I can meet it
the same way she did.

17
00:06:23,002 --> 00:06:25,619
With the same... calm.

18
00:06:28,624 --> 00:06:33,278
Cos that's where it's hidden -
the immortality I hadn't seen.

19
00:07:14,682 --> 00:07:16,966
Kids around here never fight.

20
00:07:17,513 --> 00:07:19,502
Sometimes.

21
00:07:19,595 --> 00:07:22,591
Sometimes when you see them playing

22
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:24,832
they always fight!

23
00:07:28,757 --> 00:07:31,291
- Is she afraid of me?
- Little bit.

24
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:36,044
- Are you afraid of me?
- Yes.

25
00:07:36,128 --> 00:07:39,242
- Why?
- Cos you look...

26
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,656
You look as an army!

27
00:07:42,749 --> 00:07:44,821
- I look army?
- Yes.

28
00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:48,653
Well, that don't matter.

29
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,444
It doesn't matter.

30
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,982
- Baby's tired.
- Yes.

31
00:07:59,448 --> 00:08:02,018
If she swims, she wants, she will sleep.

32
00:08:31,681 --> 00:08:33,835
All right, come on. Turn around.

33
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:36,002
Go, go, go, go. Go!

34
00:08:36,845 --> 00:08:38,917
Come on, go.

35
00:08:42,841 --> 00:08:44,913
Go, go, go, go!

36
00:10:22,808 --> 00:10:25,050
Witt, patrol boat!

37
00:10:25,144 --> 00:10:27,219
She's American.

38
00:10:37,948 --> 00:10:40,189
What's it doing out here all alone?

39
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:10,012
You haven't changed at all, have you, Witt?

40
00:11:10,104 --> 00:11:12,393
You haven't learned a thing.

41
00:11:14,233 --> 00:11:18,694
All a man has to do is leave it to you,
you'll put your head in the noose for him.

42
00:11:25,077 --> 00:11:27,153
How many times you been AWOL?

43
00:11:30,248 --> 00:11:32,870
Been in the army, what? Six years now?

44
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,957
Ain't it time you smartened up
and stopped being such a punk recruit?

45
00:11:37,048 --> 00:11:39,123
I mean, if you're ever gonna.

46
00:11:39,216 --> 00:11:41,292
We can't all be smart.

47
00:11:42,886 --> 00:11:45,377
No, we can't, and that's a shame.

48
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:47,548
Look at you.

49
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:56,522
Truth is,
you can't take straight duty in my company.

50
00:11:58,026 --> 00:12:01,477
You'll never be a real soldier,
not in God's world.

51
00:12:04,407 --> 00:12:07,859
This is C Company, of which I'm First Sergeant.
I run this outfit.

52
00:12:07,952 --> 00:12:12,780
Captain Staros, he's the CO, but I'm the guy
who runs it. Nobody's gonna foul that up.

53
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,705
You're just another mouth for me to feed.

54
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,085
Normally, you'd be court-martialled.

55
00:12:22,592 --> 00:12:24,668
But I worked a deal for ya.

56
00:12:24,761 --> 00:12:26,837
Gotta consider yourself lucky.

57
00:12:28,805 --> 00:12:32,140
I'm sending you to a disciplinary outfit.

58
00:12:32,226 --> 00:12:36,639
You'll be a stretcher-bearer.
You'll be taking care of the wounded.

59
00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:40,940
I can take anything you dish out.

60
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:43,351
I'm twice the man you are.

61
00:12:54,831 --> 00:12:56,907
In this world...

62
00:12:57,834 --> 00:13:01,666
a man himself is nothing.

63
00:13:05,342 --> 00:13:09,386
And there ain't no world but this one.

64
00:13:12,098 --> 00:13:14,175
You're wrong there, Top.

65
00:13:16,978 --> 00:13:19,054
I seen another world.

66
00:13:24,653 --> 00:13:28,519
Sometimes I think
it was just... my imagination.

67
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:33,026
Well,

68
00:13:33,244 --> 00:13:35,817
then you've seen things I never will.

69
00:13:45,547 --> 00:13:48,305
We're living in a world
that's blowing itself

70
00:13:48,306 --> 00:13:51,004
to hell as fast as
everybody can arrange it.

71
00:13:51,971 --> 00:13:56,929
In a situation like that all a man can do
is shut his eyes and let nothing touch him.

72
00:13:57,018 --> 00:13:59,092
Look out for himself.

73
00:14:11,364 --> 00:14:14,070
I might be the best friend you ever had.

74
00:14:16,286 --> 00:14:18,362
You don't even know it.

75
00:14:49,902 --> 00:14:52,190
He hates you worse than poison.

76
00:14:56,992 --> 00:15:00,444
I never felt he hated me,
cos I don't hate him.

77
00:15:41,411 --> 00:15:43,486
I love Charlie Company.

78
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:50,535
They're my people.

79
00:16:15,443 --> 00:16:17,318
They call it "The Rock".

80
00:16:17,405 --> 00:16:20,654
Nobody wants this island.
Japs just put an airfield there.

81
00:16:20,741 --> 00:16:22,614
Fighting's confined to this area.

82
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:28,288
This is their road to Australia, and this is their
way of controlling the sea lanes to America.

83
00:16:28,373 --> 00:16:33,580
If we're gonna stop the Japs' advance into the
South Pacific, we've gotta do it right there.

84
00:16:35,171 --> 00:16:38,172
The Marines have done their job.
Now it's our turn.

85
00:16:39,634 --> 00:16:41,710
Worked my ass off.

86
00:16:43,262 --> 00:16:45,338
Brown-nosed the generals.

87
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,676
Degraded myself

88
00:16:51,562 --> 00:16:54,729
for them and my family.

89
00:16:56,025 --> 00:16:58,101
For my home.

90
00:16:58,777 --> 00:17:02,063
- I admire you, Colonel. I do.
- Thank you, sir.

91
00:17:02,156 --> 00:17:05,110
Most men your age
would have retired by now.

92
00:17:05,201 --> 00:17:07,276
It's OK.

93
00:17:07,995 --> 00:17:11,992
We need general officers
with maturity and character like you.

94
00:17:12,082 --> 00:17:15,451
We've got good sergeants
and good lieutenant colonels.

95
00:17:15,545 --> 00:17:18,912
But once a man gets those eagles,
he can't wait to get that star.

96
00:17:19,006 --> 00:17:21,082
He becomes a politician, right?

97
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:23,251
Goes along to get along.

98
00:17:24,719 --> 00:17:27,970
So goddamn hard to stay upright.

99
00:17:28,055 --> 00:17:32,101
- You said it there, sir.
- With the Admiral watching, which he will be.

100
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:35,103
- There's always someone watching.
- Yeah.

101
00:17:35,897 --> 00:17:38,139
Like a hawk.

102
00:17:38,233 --> 00:17:41,352
Always someone ready to jump in,
if you're not.

103
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:55,783
- D'you have a son, Colonel?
- Yes, sir.

104
00:17:55,875 --> 00:18:00,287
Good. We don't want our sons or grandsons
fighting this war 30 years from now, do we?

105
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:03,914
- No, sir, we sure don't.
- Then you crush 'em without mercy.

106
00:18:04,008 --> 00:18:07,044
You dig them out of the hills
and protect that airfield.

107
00:18:07,136 --> 00:18:09,009
Yes, sir.

108
00:18:09,096 --> 00:18:15,265
You wonder why... Why did the Japs
put an airfield there of all places?

109
00:18:15,812 --> 00:18:19,430
I guess we don't know the bigger picture,
if there is such a thing.

110
00:18:19,523 --> 00:18:23,603
- What do you think?
- Well, sir, I never ask myself that question.

111
00:18:23,693 --> 00:18:25,354
You're a humble man.

112
00:18:27,489 --> 00:18:30,693
Nobody wants that island... but you.

113
00:18:31,952 --> 00:18:34,277
How much do you want it?

114
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,778
As much as I have to, sir.

115
00:18:40,043 --> 00:18:42,713
All they sacrificed for me

116
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:48,509
poured out like water on the ground.

117
00:18:54,307 --> 00:18:57,224
All I might have given for love's sake.

118
00:19:11,741 --> 00:19:13,817
Too late.

119
00:19:18,665 --> 00:19:20,740
Died...

120
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:24,244
slow as a tree.

121
00:19:26,504 --> 00:19:28,581
D'you feel it?

122
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,375
Yes, sir.

123
00:19:35,513 --> 00:19:37,589
Thank you, sir.

124
00:19:50,946 --> 00:19:53,234
Take topside to the signal bridge.

125
00:19:59,328 --> 00:20:02,578
The closer you are to Caesar,
the greater the fear.

126
00:20:19,431 --> 00:20:22,883
I just can't help
how damn scared I am, sarge, all right?

127
00:20:23,936 --> 00:20:25,596
I can't help it. I got...

128
00:20:25,688 --> 00:20:29,057
My step daddy took a block
and beat me when I was real little

129
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,936
and I was scared
and I used to run, I used to hide.

130
00:20:32,027 --> 00:20:35,692
Hell, I slept in the chicken coop
a whole lot of nights.

131
00:20:35,782 --> 00:20:39,944
And I never thought
it'd get no worse than that.

132
00:20:41,245 --> 00:20:45,077
But I'm living by the... by the minute here.
I'm counting the seconds.

133
00:20:45,165 --> 00:20:49,625
Hell, we're gonna be landing soon
and there's gonna be air raids.

134
00:20:49,711 --> 00:20:53,127
We're probably gonna die
before we get off the beach.

135
00:20:53,214 --> 00:20:57,212
This place is...
It's like a big floating graveyard.

136
00:20:57,302 --> 00:21:01,514
- What's your name, kid?
- I wanna own an automobile when I get out.

137
00:21:02,973 --> 00:21:05,762
- What's your name?
- Edward, Edward B Train.

138
00:21:05,852 --> 00:21:06,931
Train?

139
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:12,441
The only things that are permanent
is, is dying and the Lord. That's it.

140
00:21:12,525 --> 00:21:14,648
That's all you gotta worry about.

141
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:18,445
This war ain't... gonna be
the end of me or you neither.

142
00:21:18,531 --> 00:21:21,864
- Think we'll catch an air raid?
- How in the hell should I know?

143
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:26,696
All's I know are them crew guys said
they didn't catch no air raid the last time.

144
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:30,372
On the other hand,
time before last they nearly got blew up.

145
00:21:30,459 --> 00:21:32,333
What d'you want me to tell you?

146
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,457
You're a big help, Tills.
Nothing. Tell me nothing.

147
00:21:35,548 --> 00:21:37,006
Tell you something.

148
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:41,669
We're sitting out here on this ocean
like a couple of fuckin' ducks in these boats.

149
00:21:41,762 --> 00:21:43,719
I already know that.

150
00:21:43,806 --> 00:21:45,549
Well, brood on it, Tills.

151
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,930
Brood on it.

152
00:21:48,018 --> 00:21:51,435
- Ain't you watching the fun?
- I ain't interested.

153
00:21:51,522 --> 00:21:55,982
- Yeah, I guess it is pretty crowded.
- Wouldn't be interested, even if it wasn't.

154
00:21:56,067 --> 00:21:58,855
Well, I'm on my way to get me that pistol.

155
00:21:58,945 --> 00:22:00,606
Yeah? Well, have fun.

156
00:22:00,697 --> 00:22:02,903
Yeah, have fun.

157
00:22:02,991 --> 00:22:07,819
You'll wish you had one once we get ashore
and run into some of them samurai sabres.

158
00:22:07,913 --> 00:22:11,531
Open this door! Open this goddamn door!

159
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:13,498
Open the door!

160
00:22:15,461 --> 00:22:18,165
You all learn to deal these cards...

161
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,873
All right. Here I am sleeping, yeah.

162
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,219
All right, ladies.
Is this a sewing circle or a card game?

163
00:22:27,306 --> 00:22:31,056
All right, jack's high, jack to bet.
Robert's got two jacks.

164
00:22:34,147 --> 00:22:39,105
I never bargained for nothing like this when I
signed up for this man's army before the war.

165
00:22:39,193 --> 00:22:43,986
How was I supposed to know there was
gonna be a fuckin' war, huh? Answer me that.

166
00:22:47,076 --> 00:22:50,943
All I know is Charlie Company's
always getting screwed. Always.

167
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:53,790
And I can tell you whose fault it is, too.

168
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:55,831
It's that captain of ours.

169
00:22:55,917 --> 00:23:00,710
First he gets us stuck off on this boat
where we don't know a fucking soul.

170
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:06,254
Then he gets us stuck way down in fourth
place on the list to get off this son of a bitch.

171
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:22,017
Hello, Captain.

172
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:09,686
I read in your 201file
that you were an officer before the war.

173
00:24:10,281 --> 00:24:12,441
How'd you end up a private?

174
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,610
Cos of my wife.

175
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,576
I was in the corps of engineers.

176
00:24:18,873 --> 00:24:21,827
We'd never been separated before,

177
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,995
not even for a night.

178
00:24:24,879 --> 00:24:28,829
I took it for four months and then I quit.

179
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:32,837
Just resigned.

180
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:36,556
They sent me back to the States.

181
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:39,725
They told me
I'd never get another commission.

182
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:45,482
They said they'd see to it I got drafted
and that I for damn sure'd be in the infantry.

183
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:48,184
Sons of bitches.

184
00:24:48,819 --> 00:24:50,896
No, I don't blame them.

185
00:24:53,157 --> 00:24:55,399
Well, where is she now?

186
00:24:56,285 --> 00:24:58,361
She's home.

187
00:25:11,591 --> 00:25:14,165
Why should I be afraid to die?

188
00:25:16,805 --> 00:25:18,263
I belong to you.

189
00:25:20,517 --> 00:25:23,353
Move! Move! Move!

190
00:25:23,436 --> 00:25:25,512
Move! Move!

191
00:25:32,654 --> 00:25:33,899
Move! Move!

192
00:25:33,988 --> 00:25:35,234
Moving out!

193
00:25:35,323 --> 00:25:39,487
If I go first, I'll wait for you there.

194
00:25:40,828 --> 00:25:43,236
On the other side of the dark waters.

195
00:25:50,547 --> 00:25:52,622
Put your helmet on.

196
00:25:53,758 --> 00:25:55,834
Be with me now.

197
00:26:05,894 --> 00:26:08,386
- Feeling the pressure, Captain?
- Yes, sir.

198
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:12,063
I like you, Captain.

199
00:26:12,151 --> 00:26:17,656
And I just want you to know, well,
we're in this thing together. All right?

200
00:26:17,739 --> 00:26:21,820
Keep pressing inland till you reach the line.
I'll catch up with you there.

201
00:26:21,911 --> 00:26:23,784
- Yes, sir.
- It's all yours, Captain.

202
00:26:23,871 --> 00:26:26,326
Gangway! Gangway there!

203
00:26:26,414 --> 00:26:27,873
Coming through!

204
00:26:27,959 --> 00:26:30,875
Squad leaders! Both teams!

205
00:26:30,961 --> 00:26:33,286
This way, son. This way, right here.

206
00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:36,415
Stand by to go over the side!

207
00:27:49,329 --> 00:27:51,404
Our Father, who art in heaven...

208
00:27:52,416 --> 00:27:56,282
And forgive us our debts,
as we forgive our debtors.

209
00:27:56,377 --> 00:27:59,995
For Thine is the kingdom,
and the power, and the glory.

210
00:28:12,893 --> 00:28:14,766
Your outfit's lucky.

211
00:28:14,854 --> 00:28:16,930
Transports must've been spotted.

212
00:28:17,022 --> 00:28:19,940
You're getting outta here
just ahead of time.

213
00:28:30,327 --> 00:28:32,818
Take a breath, mister. You gotta breathe!

214
00:29:02,984 --> 00:29:04,644
- You Charlie Company?
- Yeah.

215
00:29:04,736 --> 00:29:06,812
We went in a mile. Nothing there.

216
00:29:06,905 --> 00:29:09,442
Some oil drums.
There'd be nothing there for...

217
00:29:09,532 --> 00:29:10,907
- A week.
- A week, sir.

218
00:29:10,991 --> 00:29:13,448
No casualties. Japs must've hauled ass.

219
00:29:13,536 --> 00:29:16,573
Two mortars hit the beach,
but most guys came in standing up.

220
00:29:16,664 --> 00:29:18,538
Darnedest thing I ever did see.

221
00:29:20,793 --> 00:29:23,580
They got fish that live in trees.

222
00:29:27,174 --> 00:29:31,752
If they didn't know this beach was deserted,
what else don't they know?

223
00:31:03,184 --> 00:31:06,720
Who are you to live in all these many forms?

224
00:31:38,719 --> 00:31:41,210
Your death that captures all.

225
00:31:47,603 --> 00:31:51,553
You, too, are the source
of all that's gonna be born.

226
00:32:15,714 --> 00:32:17,790
Your glory.

227
00:32:21,095 --> 00:32:23,169
Mercy.

228
00:32:24,723 --> 00:32:26,799
Peace.

229
00:32:28,768 --> 00:32:30,844
Truth.

230
00:32:37,485 --> 00:32:39,773
You give calm a spirit,

231
00:32:42,823 --> 00:32:44,900
understanding,

232
00:32:46,702 --> 00:32:48,778
courage.

233
00:32:53,459 --> 00:32:55,535
The contented heart.

234
00:36:35,801 --> 00:36:37,877
Get a medic here!

235
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:47,642
Maybe all men got one big soul
who everybody's a part of.

236
00:36:50,357 --> 00:36:52,848
All faces of the same man.

237
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:56,186
One big self.

238
00:37:30,437 --> 00:37:33,521
Everyone looking for salvation by himself.

239
00:37:40,364 --> 00:37:42,688
Each like a coal

240
00:37:42,783 --> 00:37:44,859
drawn from the fire.

241
00:38:16,899 --> 00:38:19,735
We're going straight up that hill there.

242
00:38:23,364 --> 00:38:27,493
- We can't do that, Colonel.
- Well, there's no way to outflank it.

243
00:38:27,576 --> 00:38:30,495
On the left is a cliff
that falls down into the river.

244
00:38:30,579 --> 00:38:34,363
The Japanese hold the jungle.
It has to be taken frontally.

245
00:38:36,586 --> 00:38:39,503
What about water, sir?
It's not getting up here.

246
00:38:39,589 --> 00:38:41,996
My men are... passing out, sir.

247
00:38:49,723 --> 00:38:53,673
Only time you worry about a soldier
is when he stops bitching.

248
00:39:07,116 --> 00:39:11,195
We're all gonna attack abreast.
Third Platoon in reserve.

249
00:39:11,286 --> 00:39:14,655
We've gotta cross
those three folds of ground. You see?

250
00:39:14,747 --> 00:39:17,535
Once we get beyond that,
we gotta attack that hill.

251
00:39:29,137 --> 00:39:31,644
Colonel says there's
no way to outflank it,

252
00:39:31,645 --> 00:39:34,379
so we gotta take it
head-on by frontal assault.

253
00:39:36,143 --> 00:39:37,603
- Whyte?
- Yeah?

254
00:39:37,687 --> 00:39:40,688
- See the grassy ridges at the foot of that hill?
- Yeah.

255
00:39:40,773 --> 00:39:45,767
When you get to the end of that field,
eliminate all strong points on those ridges.

256
00:39:49,949 --> 00:39:54,029
I'm sure the Japs got something there
to protect the approaches.

257
00:40:47,296 --> 00:40:49,372
Are you here?

258
00:41:03,688 --> 00:41:05,763
Let me not betray you.

259
00:41:09,484 --> 00:41:11,560
Let me not betray my men.

260
00:41:19,244 --> 00:41:21,533
In you I place my trust.

261
00:41:37,553 --> 00:41:39,629
Rosy-fingered dawn.

262
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,548
You're Greek, arent you, Captain?

263
00:41:43,643 --> 00:41:45,718
D'you ever read Homer?

264
00:41:45,812 --> 00:41:48,350
We read Homer at the Point.

265
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:50,313
In Greek.

266
00:41:50,399 --> 00:41:53,899
What kind of artillery support
do we have, sir? Over.

267
00:41:53,986 --> 00:41:58,564
- Two batteries of 105s.
- They won't make a dent. Over.

268
00:41:58,658 --> 00:42:03,035
No, but it bucks the men up.
It'll look like the Japs are catching hell.

269
00:42:56,881 --> 00:42:58,755
OK, you guys.

270
00:42:58,841 --> 00:43:00,501
This is it.

271
00:43:00,592 --> 00:43:03,084
We're going down in groups of ten.

272
00:43:04,471 --> 00:43:08,933
There's no point in going by rushes.
Only make a better target stopped, so...

273
00:43:09,018 --> 00:43:11,343
run all the way.

274
00:43:11,437 --> 00:43:14,770
We ain't got no choice.
We're picked, so we gotta go.

275
00:43:17,901 --> 00:43:20,190
I'm gonna take the first bunch myself.

276
00:43:20,279 --> 00:43:22,604
I want Charlie Dale with me. Dale?

277
00:43:22,697 --> 00:43:25,403
You go organise them guys that's up there.

278
00:43:31,123 --> 00:43:33,412
Moving out in five minutes.

279
00:43:34,292 --> 00:43:35,917
Let's go.

280
00:43:40,132 --> 00:43:42,005
Sico?

281
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,754
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm sick to my stomach.

282
00:43:45,845 --> 00:43:49,179
Sico, you get up now,
or I'll kick you so hard you're gonna be sick.

283
00:43:49,265 --> 00:43:51,057
I can't. I would if I could.

284
00:43:51,142 --> 00:43:55,435
I'm sick.

285
00:43:55,522 --> 00:43:57,597
You ain't sick. Get up!

286
00:44:01,902 --> 00:44:05,319
- What's the matter, Sico?
- I don't know, Sergeant.

287
00:44:05,406 --> 00:44:08,572
It's my stomach. I'm in pain, I got cramps.

288
00:44:08,658 --> 00:44:10,901
I can't even sit up straight. I'm sick.

289
00:44:14,916 --> 00:44:16,789
- Come on, get up!
- Leave him.

290
00:44:16,875 --> 00:44:21,122
I need a volunteer to carry the BAR!
Drop your gear. I'm taking you to the medics.

291
00:44:21,213 --> 00:44:23,289
Thank you, Sergeant.

292
00:44:25,592 --> 00:44:27,669
Don't argue with me.

293
00:44:27,761 --> 00:44:29,837
Good luck, Keck.

294
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,276
Plug that hole on your right!

295
00:45:35,368 --> 00:45:37,243
Move!

296
00:45:56,932 --> 00:45:59,008
Maybe they pulled out.

297
00:48:09,728 --> 00:48:11,353
Hit dirt!

298
00:48:11,772 --> 00:48:13,681
Hit dirt!

299
00:48:18,779 --> 00:48:21,530
Calm down, calm down,
calm down, calm down.

300
00:48:26,327 --> 00:48:28,367
Stretcher-bearers!

301
00:48:44,053 --> 00:48:45,713
Come on!

302
00:48:45,804 --> 00:48:47,880
Stretcher-bearers, this way!

303
00:48:48,974 --> 00:48:52,178
- Go get that man.
- We already got eight or nine down there...

304
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:56,314
- Don't argue with me! Get that man!
- He's not the one we should think about...

305
00:48:56,398 --> 00:48:59,684
Goddamn it, all of you!
Am I in command here or am I not?!

306
00:48:59,776 --> 00:49:03,856
- Am I the captain or a goddamn private?
- Others are hit bad. That's all I meant.

307
00:49:05,824 --> 00:49:07,947
- I gave you an order, private!
- Yes, sir!

308
00:49:10,704 --> 00:49:12,364
Hello, First Sergeant.

309
00:49:14,124 --> 00:49:16,532
Who we going after over here?

310
00:49:17,336 --> 00:49:19,411
We think it's Jacques.

311
00:49:19,962 --> 00:49:21,623
Ol' Jockey.

312
00:49:21,714 --> 00:49:24,420
Well, shit. That's, that's, that's too bad.

313
00:49:24,884 --> 00:49:26,344
Sir?

314
00:49:27,012 --> 00:49:32,301
Sir? Sir, can I come back to the company
after we get Jockey back to the battalion?

315
00:49:33,143 --> 00:49:37,223
- OK, but you gotta get permission.
- Sure. And my rifle.

316
00:49:40,275 --> 00:49:42,681
Nicky! You're still alive!

317
00:49:43,611 --> 00:49:45,485
Keep moving! Keep moving!

318
00:49:46,573 --> 00:49:48,703
Magnificent, Staros, magnificent.

319
00:49:48,704 --> 00:49:52,576
The finest thing these old
eyes have seen in a long time!

320
00:49:52,661 --> 00:49:57,158
Beautifully conceived and executed!
You'll be mentioned in battalion orders.

321
00:49:57,249 --> 00:49:59,787
Young Whyte led beautifully.

322
00:49:59,877 --> 00:50:01,952
Yes, sir. Over.

323
00:50:02,087 --> 00:50:04,922
But sending in your second
too was brilliant.

324
00:50:05,007 --> 00:50:06,901
They may have carried the ridge.

325
00:50:06,902 --> 00:50:10,511
I don't think they were hurt
too bad. Blane led well, too.

326
00:50:10,596 --> 00:50:13,383
Now, how many emplacements
did they locate?

327
00:50:13,473 --> 00:50:15,549
Did they knock any out?

328
00:50:15,642 --> 00:50:19,687
We ought to have those ridges
cleaned out by noon! Over.

329
00:50:21,816 --> 00:50:24,103
Hello! Hello! Staros, are you there?

330
00:50:24,191 --> 00:50:26,434
Here, sir. Over.

331
00:50:26,528 --> 00:50:31,403
I said, how many emplacements did they
locate? Did they knock any out? Over.

332
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:33,863
Children.

333
00:50:33,952 --> 00:50:36,787
I don't know, sir.

334
00:50:36,871 --> 00:50:41,368
What the hell do you mean, you don't know?
How can you not know? Over.

335
00:50:41,501 --> 00:50:45,795
I'm right here behind the first swell, sir.
I'm right here behind the swell.

336
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,205
You want me to stand up and wave? Over.

337
00:50:48,299 --> 00:50:51,502
No, I can see where you are.
I want you to do something.

338
00:50:51,594 --> 00:50:54,798
I want you to get up there
and see what the situation is.

339
00:50:54,889 --> 00:50:57,130
I want Hill 210 in my hands tonight.

340
00:50:57,225 --> 00:51:00,558
Now, goddamn it,
the Admiral got up at dawn for this!

341
00:51:00,645 --> 00:51:03,100
Come to life up there, Staros. Out!

342
00:51:29,464 --> 00:51:31,540
Move up!

343
00:51:49,901 --> 00:51:51,360
Hey, Keck!

344
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:54,444
Yeah!

345
00:51:54,823 --> 00:51:57,693
- We gotta get out of here.
- I know it.

346
00:51:58,659 --> 00:52:00,568
Blane's dead.

347
00:52:00,661 --> 00:52:02,737
You're in charge.

348
00:52:05,709 --> 00:52:08,828
We know you there, Yank!

349
00:52:09,628 --> 00:52:11,705
Tojo eats shit!

350
00:52:11,922 --> 00:52:15,042
No! Roosevelt eats shit!

351
00:52:50,794 --> 00:52:52,667
I got him! I got him!

352
00:53:10,605 --> 00:53:12,681
I killed a man.

353
00:53:12,774 --> 00:53:14,849
Hey, Queen!

354
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:17,441
Queen, you there?

355
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:21,572
Worst thing you can do.
Worse than rape.

356
00:53:21,657 --> 00:53:24,611
Queen! You see them Japs
leaving that left ridge?

357
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:28,533
- I killed a man. Nobody can touch me for it.
- I ain't seen nothing.

358
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:31,658
Well, get your fuckin' head up
and look around!

359
00:53:33,002 --> 00:53:35,207
I'm serious!

360
00:53:35,294 --> 00:53:39,210
I counted seven Japs
leaving that left-hand grassy ridge!

361
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,792
I got me one of'em.

362
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,130
So?

363
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:45,461
I think maybe they're pulling out.

364
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:51,180
Maybe somebody
ought to go tell the captain.

365
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:52,812
You wanna be the one to do it?

366
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:01,267
You just stay put! I'm ordering you!

367
00:54:24,385 --> 00:54:25,843
Down!

368
00:54:34,519 --> 00:54:36,596
Stay low.

369
00:55:03,172 --> 00:55:05,249
Go! Go!

370
00:55:05,466 --> 00:55:07,542
Go! Go!

371
00:55:48,341 --> 00:55:50,418
What do we do now?

372
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:54,674
We wait right here. Maybe
they'll send us up some reinforcements.

373
00:55:54,765 --> 00:55:56,223
To do what?

374
00:55:56,308 --> 00:55:59,344
To capture some of these
fucking positions around here!

375
00:55:59,436 --> 00:56:04,892
- You mean you really wanna go on with this?
- Hell, no. No, not no uphill charge.

376
00:56:04,984 --> 00:56:08,648
If they send us reinforcements,
maybe we could scout around

377
00:56:08,737 --> 00:56:10,813
and locate these machine guns.

378
00:56:10,905 --> 00:56:14,904
- Anyway, it's better than going back down.
- Something's coming!

379
00:56:14,993 --> 00:56:16,902
They're coming!

380
00:56:22,416 --> 00:56:23,661
What are they doin'?

381
00:56:23,751 --> 00:56:26,835
If they want to throw us out,
why didn't they come in force?

382
00:56:26,921 --> 00:56:29,128
Maybe they was acting on their own.

383
00:56:30,633 --> 00:56:33,124
Maybe they wanted to get into nirvana.

384
00:56:34,637 --> 00:56:36,510
They're coming.

385
00:56:46,565 --> 00:56:47,728
Keck!

386
00:56:47,816 --> 00:56:49,227
Jesus!

387
00:56:49,318 --> 00:56:51,395
Oh, Jesus!

388
00:56:53,029 --> 00:56:54,654
I blew my butt off!

389
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:58,156
- It's all right. It's all right.
- I blew my butt off!

390
00:56:58,243 --> 00:56:59,702
Lay down!

391
00:56:59,787 --> 00:57:02,538
What a fucking recruit trick to pull!

392
00:57:02,623 --> 00:57:05,624
- Take it easy. Take it easy.
- I grabbed it by the pin!

393
00:57:06,334 --> 00:57:10,747
You write my old lady. You tell her...
I want her to know I died like a man.

394
00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:13,164
Nobody's gonna have to write her.
You'll make it.

395
00:57:13,257 --> 00:57:15,131
- Don't bullshit me!
- Stay down!

396
00:57:15,219 --> 00:57:17,294
Hey, hey.

397
00:57:18,388 --> 00:57:20,179
Have I got mud on my face?

398
00:57:20,265 --> 00:57:22,341
Wipe it off. Get it off.

399
00:57:23,852 --> 00:57:25,927
No!

400
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:28,096
I'll write her. I promise.

401
00:57:31,526 --> 00:57:35,523
Take my canteen.
There's still some water in there.

402
00:57:40,326 --> 00:57:42,402
It's for the best.

403
00:57:43,288 --> 00:57:45,576
I'm all messed up down there.

404
00:57:46,749 --> 00:57:48,825
I can't fuck no more.

405
00:57:51,211 --> 00:57:54,581
Whoa... Where am I?

406
00:57:56,049 --> 00:57:57,710
Where am I?

407
00:58:00,554 --> 00:58:02,843
You're gonna be all right.

408
00:58:02,932 --> 00:58:07,059
Even if you die,
you didn't let your brother down.

409
00:58:07,144 --> 00:58:11,852
If you hadn't thrown yourself against
that embankment, we'd all have been killed.

410
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:14,017
I'm cold.

411
00:58:16,445 --> 00:58:18,603
I'm cold.

412
00:58:19,865 --> 00:58:21,940
I'm... freezing.

413
00:59:17,295 --> 00:59:19,372
You gonna write his wife?

414
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:22,673
Fuck, no.

415
00:59:23,093 --> 00:59:25,168
I don't know his old lady.

416
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:30,306
That's the company commander's job. You
outta your mind? I ain't no good at writing.

417
00:59:30,392 --> 00:59:32,468
You told him you would.

418
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:36,344
I'll say anything to 'em
when they're like that.

419
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:39,064
Somebody ought to do it.

420
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:42,020
Well, then, you write her.
Yeah, you write her.

421
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:53,576
What's wrong, Jim?

422
01:01:14,118 --> 01:01:18,660
There's nothing anybody can do for him.
He'll die before they get him to a surgeon.

423
01:01:18,747 --> 01:01:23,742
- Then I can't ask you to go out there.
- Maybe I could get some morphine into him.

424
01:01:23,836 --> 01:01:27,086
- Would it keep him quiet?
- Not for long, but I can give him two.

425
01:01:27,173 --> 01:01:30,588
And I could maybe leave him
three or four for himself.

426
01:01:32,678 --> 01:01:34,966
Couldn't you give 'em to him all at once?

427
01:01:53,448 --> 01:01:55,524
That's what you are.

428
01:01:57,243 --> 01:02:00,362
That's all there is for us.
That's us, that's us.

429
01:02:00,955 --> 01:02:04,205
I lost all twelve. I lost all twelve.

430
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:07,333
All twelve of'em.

431
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:08,878
It's insanity up there.

432
01:02:08,964 --> 01:02:13,043
I told 'em what to do, I showed 'em
where to go and I gave 'em a push.

433
01:02:13,133 --> 01:02:18,472
- Somebody help!
- I know you. I know you, Sergeant.

434
01:02:18,555 --> 01:02:23,264
It's insane. I don't know who's in charge here,
but don't let him go! Don't let him go!

435
01:02:23,352 --> 01:02:25,391
I'm outta here. I'm outta here.

436
01:02:25,479 --> 01:02:29,607
I'm outta here. All right, move feet.
Move, move, move, move. Move, move!

437
01:02:29,692 --> 01:02:32,443
I'm moving. I'm moving. I'm moving now.

438
01:02:32,528 --> 01:02:37,190
Don't touch. Don't touch. Don't look at me.
Don't touch. OK, I'm outta here.

439
01:02:37,283 --> 01:02:42,322
All right. All right.

440
01:03:00,347 --> 01:03:02,469
Somebody help me!

441
01:03:02,557 --> 01:03:03,802
Help me!

442
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:08,682
You gotta be quiet.
I came to help you, Tella.

443
01:03:08,772 --> 01:03:11,179
- OK. Calm down.
- Fuck you!

444
01:03:11,274 --> 01:03:14,359
I'm dying! I'm dying, sarge!

445
01:03:14,444 --> 01:03:16,851
OK. Well, goddamn it, do it with less noise!

446
01:03:17,864 --> 01:03:20,699
- How you gonna get me out?
- I'm gonna take you back.

447
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:25,779
- Come on.
- No!

448
01:03:25,872 --> 01:03:28,445
Put me down! Put me down!

449
01:03:33,837 --> 01:03:36,791
Leave me alone... Leave me alone.

450
01:03:36,924 --> 01:03:39,248
Please, leave me alone.

451
01:03:47,684 --> 01:03:49,761
Give me more. Give me more.

452
01:03:50,396 --> 01:03:54,889
Give me more. Give me more.

453
01:03:58,027 --> 01:03:59,272
Here, Tella.

454
01:04:08,038 --> 01:04:10,659
Goodbye... goodbye.

455
01:04:13,959 --> 01:04:15,620
Bye, kid.

456
01:04:15,711 --> 01:04:18,712
Goodbye, sarge. Goodbye.

457
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:38,930
Fortunately, Jim, the fate of the company
doesn't depend on one man.

458
01:04:43,822 --> 01:04:46,907
Sergeant, I saw the whole thing
through the glasses.

459
01:04:46,992 --> 01:04:51,238
I'm gonna mention you in orders tomorrow
and recommend you for the Silver Star.

460
01:04:51,330 --> 01:04:53,951
- It's the most courageous thing...
- Captain,

461
01:04:54,041 --> 01:04:58,252
you say one more word to thank me,
I'll knock you right in the teeth.

462
01:04:58,336 --> 01:05:02,037
You mention me in your fuckin' orders,
and I'll resign so fast

463
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:06,177
and leave you here
to run this busted-up outfit by yourself.

464
01:05:07,429 --> 01:05:09,505
You understand?

465
01:05:10,223 --> 01:05:13,972
Property!
Whole fuckin' thing's about property.

466
01:05:28,866 --> 01:05:33,160
What's the matter with you, Staros? Those
men should be reinforced immediately!

467
01:05:33,245 --> 01:05:36,081
What are they doing?
I can see 'em through my glasses.

468
01:05:36,165 --> 01:05:38,241
They're lying behind that ledge!

469
01:05:38,333 --> 01:05:41,869
They should be up and out,
cleaning out those machine guns! Over!

470
01:05:41,962 --> 01:05:44,880
I don't think you understand
what's going on, sir.

471
01:05:44,965 --> 01:05:47,836
We've had... heavy casualties.

472
01:05:47,926 --> 01:05:52,803
We had a man... His gut got shot out
on the slopes, sir. Created quite an upset.

473
01:05:52,890 --> 01:05:56,056
Fine, fine. Now,
what about those reinforcements? Over.

474
01:05:56,143 --> 01:05:59,677
I have... two squads to...

475
01:05:59,772 --> 01:06:01,977
First Platoon I can send up, sir. Over.

476
01:06:02,065 --> 01:06:04,473
What the hell do you mean, two squads?!

477
01:06:04,567 --> 01:06:08,019
Goddamn you, Staros!
When I say reinforcements,

478
01:06:08,113 --> 01:06:12,859
goddamn it, I mean it! You commit
everybody you have there and do it now!

479
01:06:12,951 --> 01:06:16,949
Your First Platoon, too. I see 'em
lying on their fat asses doing nothing.

480
01:06:17,038 --> 01:06:19,808
Get a man to 'em right
now with orders to attack,

481
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:22,080
and move 'em by the flank to the ridge.

482
01:06:22,169 --> 01:06:24,956
Then get that Second Platoon
over to the hill!

483
01:06:25,046 --> 01:06:28,296
Have 'em press the centre.
Go straight up that goddamn hill!

484
01:06:28,382 --> 01:06:30,043
Attack them right now!

485
01:06:30,134 --> 01:06:33,918
Jesus, Staros! Do I have to give you
a lesson on infantry tactics

486
01:06:34,014 --> 01:06:36,635
while your men
are getting their asses shot off?

487
01:06:36,724 --> 01:06:40,473
Colonel, I don't think you fully understand
what is going on here.

488
01:06:40,561 --> 01:06:43,765
My company alone
cannot take that position, sir.

489
01:06:43,856 --> 01:06:47,355
The Japs are too well dug in.
They've got too much fire power.

490
01:06:47,444 --> 01:06:49,519
Colonel, there's a bunker up there.

491
01:06:49,612 --> 01:06:52,981
We can't see it, and it's...
it's chewing my men to pieces, sir.

492
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:59,743
I request permission
for patrol reconnaissance around

493
01:06:59,830 --> 01:07:03,448
to the right of Hill 210.
I believe the entire position, sir,

494
01:07:03,542 --> 01:07:06,163
can be outflanked
with a manoeuvre there in force.

495
01:07:06,252 --> 01:07:08,542
- No! Goddamn it, no!
- Might save lives!

496
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:10,504
There'll be no flanking move.

497
01:07:10,591 --> 01:07:13,425
Listen, Staros.
You're not gonna take your men

498
01:07:13,510 --> 01:07:16,962
around into the jungle
to avoid a goddamn fight!

499
01:07:17,055 --> 01:07:22,595
Do you hear me, Staros? I want you to attack
right now with every man at your disposal!

500
01:07:22,685 --> 01:07:25,556
Now, attack, Staros! That's a direct order!

501
01:07:34,948 --> 01:07:37,901
Sir, I must tell you
that I refuse to obey your order.

502
01:07:52,381 --> 01:07:56,330
- There it is, right there. See it?
- I don't see it.

503
01:07:57,095 --> 01:07:59,881
This is not your fault, Jim.
He's ordering you to.

504
01:08:03,433 --> 01:08:08,890
I again request permission for patrol
reconnaissance around to the right in force.

505
01:08:10,149 --> 01:08:13,849
The time, sir,... is 1321 hours, 25 seconds.

506
01:08:13,944 --> 01:08:18,938
I have two witnesses here. I request that
you do the same with witnesses there. Over.

507
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:27,656
Staros, don't pull this
guardhouse-lawyer bullshit with me!

508
01:08:27,749 --> 01:08:31,830
Now, I know you're a goddamn lawyer!
This is not a court of law.

509
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:34,162
This is a war. It's a goddamn battle!

510
01:08:34,256 --> 01:08:39,131
Now, I want that frontal attack.
I repeat my order. Over.

511
01:08:39,219 --> 01:08:42,885
Colonel, I refuse to take my men up there
in a frontal attack.

512
01:08:42,973 --> 01:08:45,130
It's suicide, sir.

513
01:08:45,224 --> 01:08:50,385
I've lived with these men for two years, and
I will not order them all to their deaths. Over.

514
01:08:59,405 --> 01:09:01,979
This is a very important decision, Staros.

515
01:09:05,578 --> 01:09:09,410
But if you feel that strongly, maybe
you have a reason, so I'm coming down.

516
01:09:09,498 --> 01:09:11,870
Go take a look.

517
01:09:11,958 --> 01:09:14,664
I'm not rescinding my order to you, son,

518
01:09:14,754 --> 01:09:19,581
but if I find extenuating circumstances
when I get there, I'll take that into account.

519
01:09:19,675 --> 01:09:23,968
Now, in the meantime, goddamn it,
I want you to hold on until I get there.

520
01:09:24,054 --> 01:09:28,265
And, if possible, you get those men
on the ridge out and moving! Out.

521
01:09:41,489 --> 01:09:44,109
One spot's as good as another, men.

522
01:09:44,198 --> 01:09:46,274
There's no place to hide.

523
01:09:50,789 --> 01:09:55,284
Just take it easy, son.
Take it easy. Take it easy.

524
01:09:56,294 --> 01:09:58,749
Where's... where's Fife?

525
01:09:58,838 --> 01:10:01,045
Fife? He's right here, son. Fife.

526
01:10:01,132 --> 01:10:03,754
Hold my hand, Fife.

527
01:10:04,678 --> 01:10:06,754
Hold my hand.

528
01:10:11,934 --> 01:10:13,927
I got it.

529
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:20,017
I'm dying, Fife.

530
01:10:47,051 --> 01:10:49,211
Oh, Captain...

531
01:11:38,268 --> 01:11:40,558
Shut up in a tomb.

532
01:11:42,523 --> 01:11:44,812
Can't lift the lid.

533
01:11:47,068 --> 01:11:49,357
Played a role I never conceived.

534
01:11:49,738 --> 01:11:53,652
Get that blouse on, soldier.
It's not a goddamn bathing beach!

535
01:11:53,742 --> 01:11:55,402
Put it on right now.

536
01:11:55,493 --> 01:11:58,863
What you aiming at, son?
Let's go get those son of a bitches.

537
01:11:58,955 --> 01:12:01,031
Move up!

538
01:12:10,884 --> 01:12:14,548
What are you doing laying down there
where you can't see a damn thing?

539
01:12:20,142 --> 01:12:23,428
Observing, sir. Just sent
First Platoon forward to the ridge.

540
01:12:23,521 --> 01:12:27,139
- How many of'em were hit this time?
- None, sir.

541
01:12:27,233 --> 01:12:29,308
None? Not one?

542
01:12:30,319 --> 01:12:34,269
Doesn't sound like the situation
you described to me over the sound power.

543
01:12:34,365 --> 01:12:38,943
Well, it's not. The situation's changed
just in the last five minutes, sir.

544
01:12:42,497 --> 01:12:44,573
Captain, you listen to me.

545
01:12:44,667 --> 01:12:47,288
We're going over there
and taking everybody with us.

546
01:12:47,377 --> 01:12:49,869
Do you have any more complaints
or demurrers?

547
01:12:51,298 --> 01:12:54,632
- No, sir. Not now.
- All right! We're gonna do things my way!

548
01:12:54,718 --> 01:12:57,126
My way! You understand that, Captain?

549
01:12:57,220 --> 01:13:01,514
We're taking everybody over to that ledge!
We may take that ridge by nightfall!

550
01:13:01,599 --> 01:13:05,467
I think the ridge
is quite a way from being reduced, sir.

551
01:13:12,651 --> 01:13:15,144
Show me how-to see things the way you do.

552
01:13:18,366 --> 01:13:20,692
Show me how-to see things the way you do.

553
01:13:24,038 --> 01:13:27,158
We're just dirt. We're just dirt.

554
01:13:50,773 --> 01:13:53,263
We're gonna get killed if we stay here.

555
01:13:53,359 --> 01:13:56,608
Bell, take six men

556
01:13:56,696 --> 01:13:58,771
and go see what's up there.

557
01:14:04,161 --> 01:14:07,197
And we'll cover you the best we can
from down there.

558
01:15:26,907 --> 01:15:28,367
OK.

559
01:15:28,452 --> 01:15:30,943
You guys, you guys, stay here. OK?

560
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:34,155
I'm going alone.

561
01:17:13,762 --> 01:17:15,839
Come out.

562
01:17:21,186 --> 01:17:23,263
Come out where I am.

563
01:18:31,713 --> 01:18:34,465
There was a... There was a...

564
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:38,463
There's a bunker... up there.

565
01:18:40,305 --> 01:18:42,381
It's five guns.

566
01:18:42,724 --> 01:18:45,013
It's five guns.

567
01:18:49,439 --> 01:18:54,315
That strongpoint up there,
somewhere up there around those rocks,

568
01:18:54,402 --> 01:18:56,477
is the key to this ridge.

569
01:18:59,575 --> 01:19:01,696
Bell here is quite right.

570
01:19:01,784 --> 01:19:07,491
From their knob up there, those little brown
brothers can cover the whole of the ground

571
01:19:07,582 --> 01:19:11,912
in front of this position for 1,000 yards.
They've left this ledge unguarded.

572
01:19:12,003 --> 01:19:15,952
Now, goddamn it, that's a mistake.
That's a hell of a mistake.

573
01:19:16,048 --> 01:19:20,211
We need to take advantage of it
before they see their error.

574
01:19:22,638 --> 01:19:26,090
All right, all right,
I know you're all pretty exhausted,

575
01:19:26,183 --> 01:19:29,634
and we've had a hell of a time
getting water up here.

576
01:19:30,521 --> 01:19:33,438
For that I'm sorry. I apologise to you all.

577
01:19:34,566 --> 01:19:39,228
But if we can reduce this bunker tomorrow,
I think we can take this ridge.

578
01:19:42,074 --> 01:19:44,399
So I'm asking for volunteers.

579
01:19:44,492 --> 01:19:46,735
Go back up there and knock it out.

580
01:19:46,829 --> 01:19:48,904
Sir?

581
01:19:48,997 --> 01:19:51,074
I'll be glad to go back up

582
01:19:51,166 --> 01:19:53,491
- and lead the way back for a party.
- Right.

583
01:19:53,585 --> 01:19:55,293
- I'll go, sir.
- You.

584
01:19:56,045 --> 01:19:57,504
All right.

585
01:19:57,589 --> 01:20:02,416
- I'd like to lead the party, Colonel.
- All right, John. I was hoping you'd say that.

586
01:20:02,510 --> 01:20:05,428
- You'll be in command.
- I'll go, sir.

587
01:20:05,513 --> 01:20:06,888
- Sir?
- You.

588
01:20:06,973 --> 01:20:10,971
All right, men, that's enough.
Seven is plenty. Gather up.

589
01:20:14,773 --> 01:20:19,268
I don't know if you realise the importance
of this operation, Staros.

590
01:20:20,445 --> 01:20:23,861
Once our position is secured,
we can move the bombers in.

591
01:20:23,948 --> 01:20:27,897
That means air power
for 1,000 miles in every direction.

592
01:20:29,328 --> 01:20:32,449
Guadalcanal may be
the turning point in the war.

593
01:20:33,581 --> 01:20:37,165
- It'll cost lives. Is that what's troubling you?
- No, sir.

594
01:20:40,297 --> 01:20:43,298
I explained to you
the importance of this objective.

595
01:20:43,384 --> 01:20:46,587
How many men do you think it's worth?
How many lives?

596
01:20:46,679 --> 01:20:48,754
I can't say, sir.

597
01:20:55,061 --> 01:20:59,890
Are you prepared to sacrifice the lives
of any of your men in this campaign?

598
01:21:02,277 --> 01:21:04,353
How many? One? Two?

599
01:21:05,955 --> 01:21:08,031
Twenty?

600
01:21:09,250 --> 01:21:12,371
Lives will be lost in your company, Captain.

601
01:21:13,672 --> 01:21:18,084
And if you don't have the stomach for it,
now is the time to let me know.

602
01:21:18,968 --> 01:21:22,882
No, sir. You're right...
about everything you said.

603
01:21:22,972 --> 01:21:25,047
Fine, fine.

604
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:27,217
That's all, Captain.

605
01:21:28,936 --> 01:21:31,012
One more thing, Staros.

606
01:21:31,772 --> 01:21:36,066
It's not necessary for you
to ever tell me that you think I'm right.

607
01:21:36,652 --> 01:21:38,311
Ever.

608
01:21:38,403 --> 01:21:40,729
We'll assume it.

609
01:21:40,823 --> 01:21:42,696
Dismissed.

610
01:21:59,425 --> 01:22:01,500
I feel sorry for you, kid.

611
01:22:02,886 --> 01:22:04,962
- Yeah?
- Yeah, a little.

612
01:22:08,433 --> 01:22:10,509
This army's gonna kill you.

613
01:22:14,021 --> 01:22:17,095
If you were smart, you'd
take care of yourself.

614
01:22:17,096 --> 01:22:19,976
There's nothing you
can do for anybody else.

615
01:22:20,069 --> 01:22:24,233
You're just running into a burning house
where nobody can be saved.

616
01:22:37,085 --> 01:22:41,913
What difference do you think you can make?
One single man in all this madness.

617
01:22:47,471 --> 01:22:49,878
If you die, it's gonna be for nothing.

618
01:22:54,019 --> 01:22:58,682
There's not some other world out there
where everything's gonna be OK.

619
01:22:58,774 --> 01:23:00,850
There's just this one.

620
01:23:02,778 --> 01:23:04,854
Just this rock.

621
01:23:41,815 --> 01:23:44,307
Go ahead! Come on, come on.

622
01:23:44,401 --> 01:23:47,521
Who's deciding who's gonna live?

623
01:23:47,613 --> 01:23:50,318
Who's deciding who's gonna die?

624
01:23:52,201 --> 01:23:54,277
This is futile!

625
01:23:55,746 --> 01:24:00,822
Look at me!
I stand right up here and not one bullet.

626
01:24:00,918 --> 01:24:02,993
Not one shot!

627
01:24:03,921 --> 01:24:05,795
Why?

628
01:24:06,089 --> 01:24:08,165
How come they all had to die?

629
01:24:08,258 --> 01:24:12,719
I can stand right here, I can stand right up
and nothing happens to me!

630
01:24:33,199 --> 01:24:35,275
We.

631
01:24:41,832 --> 01:24:43,908
We together.

632
01:24:54,636 --> 01:24:56,712
One being.

633
01:25:11,736 --> 01:25:14,025
Flow together like water,

634
01:25:17,326 --> 01:25:19,613
till I can't tell you from me.

635
01:25:37,512 --> 01:25:39,588
I drink you.

636
01:25:41,641 --> 01:25:43,717
Now.

637
01:25:46,062 --> 01:25:48,138
Now.

638
01:26:24,766 --> 01:26:26,842
You're my light.

639
01:26:30,105 --> 01:26:32,181
My guide.

640
01:27:41,007 --> 01:27:44,673
John, I'll be behind you.
If you wanna breakthrough, we'll come after.

641
01:27:44,761 --> 01:27:47,298
We'll charge at your whistle signal.

642
01:27:48,055 --> 01:27:50,548
All right, let's go, men. Go get 'em.

643
01:29:44,879 --> 01:29:46,953
OK.

644
01:29:47,965 --> 01:29:50,633
Stay down, below this ledge,

645
01:29:50,717 --> 01:29:54,715
and I'll call down the data from above.

646
01:29:54,805 --> 01:29:59,384
Once the 81s have plastered that rock...
as much as possible,

647
01:29:59,476 --> 01:30:03,259
we're gonna crawl out
along that big rock for cover

648
01:30:04,773 --> 01:30:06,848
and then flank 'em to the right.

649
01:30:06,941 --> 01:30:08,815
OK?

650
01:30:10,319 --> 01:30:12,893
OK. OK.

651
01:30:33,593 --> 01:30:38,171
Azimuth 1470... from Easy Roger 7.

652
01:30:39,057 --> 01:30:41,381
100 left, add 200.

653
01:30:41,474 --> 01:30:44,144
Uncle Baker 1, fire mission.

654
01:30:44,228 --> 01:30:47,229
Azimuth 1470 from Easy Roger 7.

655
01:30:47,314 --> 01:30:50,517
Left 100, add 200.

656
01:30:51,193 --> 01:30:54,479
Machine gun. Will adjust. Over.

657
01:30:54,571 --> 01:30:57,322
Understand. 1470 from Easy Roger 7.

658
01:31:11,713 --> 01:31:13,789
Left 25, drop 50!

659
01:31:14,966 --> 01:31:17,042
Left 25, Uncle Baker 1.

660
01:31:17,134 --> 01:31:19,424
Left 25, drop 50.

661
01:31:19,512 --> 01:31:21,588
Fire for effect. Over.

662
01:31:21,849 --> 01:31:23,923
Roger, Uncle Baker 1.

663
01:31:46,289 --> 01:31:47,948
Let's go!

664
01:32:03,389 --> 01:32:06,804
OK, we're gonna continue on
up the hill to the right.

665
01:32:06,891 --> 01:32:11,138
Nobody fire or throw the grenades
till I give the signal.

666
01:32:11,229 --> 01:32:13,306
OK, let's do it.

667
01:32:27,954 --> 01:32:30,908
Is he OK? Is he all right?

668
01:32:30,999 --> 01:32:33,371
What we gonna do? Can't take him with us.

669
01:32:33,459 --> 01:32:37,504
- No, we can't leave him here.
- He's from your platoon. You stay with him.

670
01:32:37,589 --> 01:32:41,586
We can leave him and pick him up
on the way back,... if he's still alive.

671
01:32:45,471 --> 01:32:47,878
- Is he dead?
- Not yet.

672
01:32:47,974 --> 01:32:51,556
Dale, stay with him!
Cover our flank! Move!

673
01:33:16,293 --> 01:33:17,372
Behind you!

674
01:33:32,808 --> 01:33:34,884
We're pinned down!

675
01:34:04,798 --> 01:34:06,875
Fall back!

676
01:34:11,847 --> 01:34:13,305
Go!

677
01:35:24,418 --> 01:35:26,493
Watch out.

678
01:36:05,124 --> 01:36:06,583
Clear!

679
01:36:58,801 --> 01:37:00,878
Come on. Get out.

680
01:37:02,263 --> 01:37:04,339
Go on.

681
01:37:07,309 --> 01:37:09,386
Think you're soldiers?

682
01:37:16,402 --> 01:37:18,643
You piece of shit!

683
01:37:24,910 --> 01:37:28,947
Son of a bitch!

684
01:37:47,975 --> 01:37:50,050
All right?

685
01:37:52,813 --> 01:37:54,888
I shot a man.

686
01:38:30,141 --> 01:38:32,216
Stinks around here.

687
01:38:33,435 --> 01:38:36,970
- All these dead people.
- Put a cigarette up your nose.

688
01:39:59,102 --> 01:40:03,390
Look at 'em move!

689
01:40:03,482 --> 01:40:05,356
We got 'em on the run!

690
01:40:05,442 --> 01:40:08,645
Way to go, John. When they saw you
make that attack and win,

691
01:40:08,736 --> 01:40:11,275
you put their hearts back into them.

692
01:40:11,365 --> 01:40:13,570
- Hey, hey!
- Don't do that, soldier.

693
01:40:13,657 --> 01:40:18,450
Take care of the others. G-2 will want them.
There'll be somebody around before long.

694
01:40:18,537 --> 01:40:20,993
We've wasted enough time here. Let's go.

695
01:40:21,082 --> 01:40:23,834
Sir, I've a few recommendations
for decorations.

696
01:40:23,918 --> 01:40:27,453
Yes. We'll get everything for all of'em
that we can, but later.

697
01:40:27,546 --> 01:40:32,008
Meantime, I want you to know I'm personally
recommending you for something, John.

698
01:40:32,093 --> 01:40:33,551
Perhaps the big one.

699
01:40:33,636 --> 01:40:36,720
- Thank you, sir, but I don't feel...
- Yes, you do, John.

700
01:40:36,806 --> 01:40:39,641
Getting it for you
will be the goddamn problem!

701
01:40:39,725 --> 01:40:44,137
But, hell, it'd be a big thing for the battalion
and the regiment, if you did get it.

702
01:40:44,230 --> 01:40:45,889
We better move out.

703
01:40:45,980 --> 01:40:50,525
We need to extend our lines, hook up with
the other companies and push on to the top.

704
01:40:50,611 --> 01:40:53,564
Would you like to take command
of Baker Company?

705
01:40:53,656 --> 01:40:54,687
Of course.

706
01:40:54,782 --> 01:40:58,009
Sir, I don't mean to be a wet
blanket, but about the water.

707
01:40:58,010 --> 01:40:59,407
If we don't get water...

708
01:40:59,495 --> 01:41:01,571
Don't worry about water.

709
01:41:03,081 --> 01:41:08,324
John, I don't want anything to break up this
attack of ours now we have the momentum.

710
01:41:08,419 --> 01:41:11,955
We'll have some water in a...
couple of hours.

711
01:41:12,048 --> 01:41:14,124
I've arranged for that.

712
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:18,258
Now, we just can't stop now, goddamn it,
and wait for it.

713
01:41:18,346 --> 01:41:20,220
No, sir.

714
01:41:20,307 --> 01:41:22,512
That's right.

715
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:28,390
And if some of the men... pass out,
why, hell, they'll just have to pass out.

716
01:41:32,193 --> 01:41:34,067
All right.

717
01:41:34,153 --> 01:41:35,612
They could...

718
01:41:35,697 --> 01:41:39,030
- They could die from it.
- They could die from enemy fire, too!

719
01:41:40,367 --> 01:41:42,657
They're all tough boys.

720
01:41:47,416 --> 01:41:52,541
Come on, men, let's go! You'll see
plenty more of those where we're going!

721
01:41:52,630 --> 01:41:55,203
Are we going up this hill or aren't we?

722
01:41:59,095 --> 01:42:03,045
John, I'm convinced that
the Japanese position can be broken now.

723
01:42:03,140 --> 01:42:06,341
All we have to do is keep
going and we'll have this hill.

724
01:42:06,342 --> 01:42:08,217
We'll have this hill by sundown.

725
01:42:08,311 --> 01:42:11,312
You see the spirit in these men?
D'you see the new spirit?

726
01:42:11,398 --> 01:42:16,559
Well, I want to take advantage of that before
something happens to sap their strength.

727
01:42:16,653 --> 01:42:19,524
To have this battalion relieved in a defeat,

728
01:42:19,615 --> 01:42:23,279
or even to have it reinforced
from troops from the reserves,

729
01:42:23,368 --> 01:42:26,535
if we were to stall
before reaching the top, well,

730
01:42:26,621 --> 01:42:30,867
Jesus Christ, that's just
a hell of a lot more than I could stand!

731
01:42:30,959 --> 01:42:33,331
I've waited all my life for this.

732
01:42:33,419 --> 01:42:37,962
I've worked, slaved, eaten... oh, untold
buckets of shit to have this opportunity!

733
01:42:38,049 --> 01:42:40,504
And I don't intend to give it up now.

734
01:42:43,679 --> 01:42:47,344
You don't know what it feels like
to be passed over.

735
01:42:47,432 --> 01:42:50,599
I mean, you're young.
You're just out of the Academy.

736
01:42:50,687 --> 01:42:56,357
You're, you know, you've got your war!
This 15 years, this is my first war!

737
01:43:01,822 --> 01:43:05,155
John, some day you'll understand.

738
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:13,115
You're like a son to me, John.

739
01:43:15,502 --> 01:43:17,579
You know what my son does?

740
01:43:18,505 --> 01:43:20,582
He's a bait salesman.

741
01:43:23,176 --> 01:43:25,252
You've done a hell of a job, John.

742
01:43:25,344 --> 01:43:30,173
I'm gonna make sure that you get everything,
everything that you deserve.

743
01:43:32,435 --> 01:43:34,511
Thank you, sir.

744
01:43:36,606 --> 01:43:38,682
God...

745
01:43:39,734 --> 01:43:42,225
Goddamn it! I want three runners!

746
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:43,980
Get me three runners!

747
01:43:44,072 --> 01:43:46,314
You go back to the rear to find water

748
01:43:46,407 --> 01:43:49,278
and get back here with it
as fast as you can!

749
01:43:50,203 --> 01:43:53,406
We attack in one hour!
We'll throw everything we got at 'em.

750
01:43:53,497 --> 01:43:55,989
We're going all the way! Nothing'll stop us.

751
01:43:56,084 --> 01:43:58,160
It's high ground by nightfall!

752
01:44:22,318 --> 01:44:24,856
You seen many dead people?

753
01:44:25,654 --> 01:44:27,611
Plenty.

754
01:44:27,698 --> 01:44:30,319
They're no different than dead dogs,

755
01:44:31,034 --> 01:44:33,110
once you get used to the idea.

756
01:44:37,958 --> 01:44:40,033
They're meat, kid.

757
01:44:56,101 --> 01:44:59,054
Are you righteous? Kind?

758
01:45:02,148 --> 01:45:04,306
Does your confidence lie in this?

759
01:45:07,737 --> 01:45:09,812
Are you loved by all?

760
01:45:12,115 --> 01:45:14,192
Know that I was, too.

761
01:45:17,787 --> 01:45:22,450
Do you imagine your sufferings will be less
because you loved goodness?

762
01:45:23,085 --> 01:45:25,162
Truth?

763
01:49:23,487 --> 01:49:26,689
Get fucking on the ground!
Get down! Get down!

764
01:49:27,448 --> 01:49:29,524
Get down. Stay there.

765
01:49:38,001 --> 01:49:41,867
Get on the ground!
Get on the fucking ground!

766
01:49:41,963 --> 01:49:43,836
Now!

767
01:50:43,523 --> 01:50:45,598
This great evil.

768
01:50:48,361 --> 01:50:50,436
Where's it come from?

769
01:50:55,117 --> 01:50:57,193
How'd it steal into the world?

770
01:51:08,965 --> 01:51:12,498
What seed, what root did it grow from?

771
01:51:17,430 --> 01:51:19,507
Who's doing this?

772
01:51:22,102 --> 01:51:24,177
Who's killing us?

773
01:51:28,149 --> 01:51:30,641
Robbing us of life and light.

774
01:51:35,406 --> 01:51:38,822
Mocking us with the sight
of what we might have known.

775
01:52:04,810 --> 01:52:07,514
Does our ruin benefit the Earth?

776
01:52:09,898 --> 01:52:13,516
Does it help the grass to grow
or the sun to shine?

777
01:52:19,699 --> 01:52:21,988
Is this darkness in you, too?

778
01:52:28,458 --> 01:52:30,784
Have you passed through this night?

779
01:52:37,008 --> 01:52:39,546
I'm gonna sink my teeth into your liver.

780
01:52:43,265 --> 01:52:45,340
You're dying.

781
01:52:57,278 --> 01:52:59,354
See them birds up there?

782
01:53:01,115 --> 01:53:03,404
You know they eat you raw?

783
01:53:08,330 --> 01:53:11,497
Where you're going,
you're not coming back from.

784
01:54:22,986 --> 01:54:25,063
What are you to me?

785
01:54:30,869 --> 01:54:32,946
Nothing.

786
01:56:54,134 --> 01:56:56,210
Have a seat here.

787
01:57:06,479 --> 01:57:09,267
Staros, I'm relieving you of your command.

788
01:57:12,652 --> 01:57:15,024
Lieutenant Band will take over for you.

789
01:57:16,740 --> 01:57:18,815
I already told him.

790
01:57:29,210 --> 01:57:31,499
It's a hard thing to do.

791
01:57:32,296 --> 01:57:34,372
Difficult decision to make.

792
01:57:37,509 --> 01:57:39,668
I don't think you're tough enough.

793
01:57:41,180 --> 01:57:46,175
You're too soft. You're just too softhearted.
You're not tough-fibred enough.

794
01:57:50,732 --> 01:57:54,681
Anyway, it's my decision to make.
I've already made it.

795
01:57:55,402 --> 01:57:57,892
I don't like to see my men get killed, sir.

796
01:58:06,163 --> 01:58:09,366
Have you ever had anyone
die in your arms, sir?

797
01:58:09,457 --> 01:58:11,747
Have you?

798
01:58:24,389 --> 01:58:27,342
I don't see any reason
to make a scandal out of this.

799
01:58:27,433 --> 01:58:30,200
I don't want it in the
records of the battalion.

800
01:58:30,201 --> 01:58:32,854
There's no reason for
you to have it on yours.

801
01:58:32,940 --> 01:58:36,521
This has nothing to do with
cowardice or inefficiency.

802
01:58:39,821 --> 01:58:42,109
Look at this jungle.

803
01:58:42,198 --> 01:58:47,537
Look at those vines, the way they twine
around the trees, swallowing everything.

804
01:58:49,955 --> 01:58:52,244
Nature's cruel, Staros.

805
01:59:01,508 --> 01:59:07,048
I'm going to let you apply for reassignment
to the Judge Advocate General Corps

806
01:59:07,139 --> 01:59:09,013
for reasons of ill health.

807
01:59:09,100 --> 01:59:10,474
You're a lawyer.

808
01:59:10,558 --> 01:59:12,930
- You had malaria yet?
- No, I haven't.

809
01:59:13,020 --> 01:59:15,392
Doesn't matter. I can fix that.

810
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:17,722
Anyway, you probably will have it.

811
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:21,436
I'm also recommending you
for the Silver Star.

812
01:59:21,528 --> 01:59:25,691
And I'll recommend it in such a way
it definitely won't be refused.

813
01:59:26,617 --> 01:59:29,238
Might as well have the Purple Heart, too.

814
01:59:31,913 --> 01:59:33,573
Why?

815
01:59:33,665 --> 01:59:39,287
Because of that scratch on your face
and because of those cuts on your hands.

816
01:59:39,378 --> 01:59:41,038
Listen to me, Staros.

817
01:59:41,130 --> 01:59:45,175
I think it's best you go back with
the next batch of wounded and prisoners.

818
01:59:45,260 --> 01:59:49,043
It is no goddamn good for you
to keep hanging around.

819
01:59:49,138 --> 01:59:52,673
The quieter we keep this,
the better it'll be for all.

820
02:00:27,342 --> 02:00:29,584
This is from Colonel Tall.

821
02:00:31,095 --> 02:00:34,595
"Our victory gives us
the highest reasons for pride. "

822
02:00:35,684 --> 02:00:39,218
"It will prove a milestone
in the battle for Guadalcanal. "

823
02:00:40,563 --> 02:00:45,558
"Tomorrow the division commander
will arrive to make an inspection of the line. "

824
02:00:45,651 --> 02:00:50,895
"After the inspection we're to be relieved by a
battalion of the division's reserve regiment. "

825
02:00:52,367 --> 02:00:56,614
"I've secured for the battalion
a week's rest off the line. "

826
02:01:00,875 --> 02:01:02,334
That's all.

827
02:02:57,739 --> 02:02:59,815
Hours like months.

828
02:03:02,576 --> 02:03:04,653
Days like years.

829
02:03:07,999 --> 02:03:10,075
Walked into the golden age.

830
02:03:14,047 --> 02:03:16,619
Stood on the shores of the New World.

831
02:03:27,559 --> 02:03:30,513
I would've come by
and paid you guys a visit,

832
02:03:30,604 --> 02:03:32,264
but...

833
02:03:35,400 --> 02:03:38,022
I just felt like being alone, you know?

834
02:03:39,821 --> 02:03:41,898
Yeah?

835
02:03:52,083 --> 02:03:54,160
We wanted to thank you, sir.

836
02:03:58,214 --> 02:04:00,705
For asking to make that flanking move.

837
02:04:02,803 --> 02:04:04,878
For watching out for us.

838
02:04:06,932 --> 02:04:09,008
Keeping us together.

839
02:04:14,188 --> 02:04:16,265
We're all sorry to see you go.

840
02:04:16,357 --> 02:04:18,516
We feel like you got a rotten deal.

841
02:04:20,778 --> 02:04:23,944
Well, I'm not sure that youre right.

842
02:04:26,701 --> 02:04:28,575
Tough part is...

843
02:04:30,495 --> 02:04:32,951
not knowing if you're doing any good.

844
02:04:34,833 --> 02:04:36,910
That's the hard part.

845
02:04:38,671 --> 02:04:41,292
But it doesn't matter. I don't care.

846
02:04:42,132 --> 02:04:44,209
I'm glad to be going.

847
02:04:45,469 --> 02:04:47,426
I'm glad.

848
02:04:47,513 --> 02:04:51,296
- There's still time. We could file a complaint.
- For what?

849
02:04:52,392 --> 02:04:54,635
What good would that do?

850
02:04:56,354 --> 02:04:58,014
Anyway, I wanna go.

851
02:05:00,943 --> 02:05:03,398
Leave it alone. Let it lay.

852
02:05:15,999 --> 02:05:18,074
What does that mean, sir?

853
02:05:20,795 --> 02:05:23,120
It means "You've been like my sons".

854
02:05:34,392 --> 02:05:36,468
You are my sons.

855
02:05:37,728 --> 02:05:39,805
My dear sons.

856
02:05:43,692 --> 02:05:45,768
You live inside me now.

857
02:05:49,781 --> 02:05:51,857
I'll carry you wherever I go.

858
02:06:07,883 --> 02:06:10,669
Can't nothing make you forget it.

859
02:06:14,389 --> 02:06:16,880
Each time you start from scratch.

860
02:06:22,689 --> 02:06:25,309
War don't ennoble men.

861
02:06:26,359 --> 02:06:28,648
It turns 'em into dogs.

862
02:06:34,450 --> 02:06:36,526
Poisons the soul.

863
02:07:40,514 --> 02:07:42,591
My dear wife,

864
02:07:45,353 --> 02:07:51,936
you get something twisted out of your
insides by all this blood, filth, and noise.

865
02:08:01,410 --> 02:08:04,031
I wanna stay changeless for you.

866
02:08:06,623 --> 02:08:09,624
I wanna come back to you
the man I was before.

867
02:08:17,634 --> 02:08:20,339
How do we get to those other shores?

868
02:08:24,183 --> 02:08:26,258
To those blue hills.

869
02:08:36,486 --> 02:08:38,146
Love.

870
02:08:47,705 --> 02:08:49,782
Where does it come from?

871
02:08:58,216 --> 02:09:00,291
Who lit this flame in us?

872
02:09:07,349 --> 02:09:09,425
No war can put it out,

873
02:09:10,936 --> 02:09:13,013
conquer it.

874
02:09:20,863 --> 02:09:22,939
I was a prisoner.

875
02:09:27,410 --> 02:09:29,486
You set me free.

876
02:09:33,625 --> 02:09:36,163
No matter how much training you got,

877
02:09:37,296 --> 02:09:39,372
how careful you are,

878
02:09:40,757 --> 02:09:44,208
it's a matter of luck
whether or not you get killed.

879
02:09:44,302 --> 02:09:49,545
Makes no difference who you are,
or how tough a guy you might be,

880
02:09:51,601 --> 02:09:56,013
if you're in the wrong spot
at the wrong time, you're gonna get it.

881
02:10:06,740 --> 02:10:09,196
I look at that boy dying,

882
02:10:10,702 --> 02:10:12,779
I don't feel nothing.

883
02:10:16,041 --> 02:10:18,711
I don't care about nothing any more.

884
02:10:23,382 --> 02:10:25,457
Sounds like bliss.

885
02:10:29,931 --> 02:10:32,005
I don't have that feeling yet.

886
02:10:33,432 --> 02:10:35,509
That numbness.

887
02:10:36,562 --> 02:10:38,637
Not like the rest of you guys.

888
02:10:42,984 --> 02:10:45,273
Maybe cos I knew what to expect.

889
02:10:48,489 --> 02:10:50,732
Maybe I was just frozen up already.

890
02:11:34,535 --> 02:11:38,033
I haven't touched another woman
since I was called up.

891
02:11:39,122 --> 02:11:41,198
Or talked to one.

892
02:11:45,212 --> 02:11:47,287
I don't wanna...

893
02:11:48,006 --> 02:11:50,544
I don't wanna feel the desire.

894
02:12:27,627 --> 02:12:29,288
All right. Abrahams!

895
02:12:29,379 --> 02:12:31,040
Abrahams. Here you go.

896
02:12:31,131 --> 02:12:33,005
Stack! Where's Stack?

897
02:12:33,092 --> 02:12:35,132
Bring him out.

898
02:12:35,219 --> 02:12:37,294
Bell?

899
02:12:37,387 --> 02:12:39,262
Bell!

900
02:12:40,307 --> 02:12:42,797
Another one for Bell. Another one for Bell.

901
02:12:45,563 --> 02:12:47,638
Dear Jack,

902
02:12:49,441 --> 02:12:54,601
I've met an Air Force captain.
I've fallen in love with him.

903
02:12:57,323 --> 02:12:59,613
I want a divorce to marry him.

904
02:13:05,957 --> 02:13:09,540
I know you can say no,
but I'm asking you anyway,

905
02:13:09,627 --> 02:13:12,415
out of the memory of what we had together.

906
02:13:19,178 --> 02:13:21,254
Forgive me.

907
02:13:22,223 --> 02:13:24,796
It just got too lonely, Jack.

908
02:13:45,120 --> 02:13:47,196
We'll meet again some day.

909
02:13:51,001 --> 02:13:54,950
People who have been as close as we've been
always meet again.

910
02:14:03,430 --> 02:14:06,265
I have no right to speak to you this way.

911
02:14:06,349 --> 02:14:08,638
I can't stop myself.

912
02:14:09,143 --> 02:14:11,219
A habit so strong.

913
02:14:13,399 --> 02:14:16,019
Oh, my friend of all those shining years.

914
02:14:20,155 --> 02:14:22,231
Help me leave you!

915
02:15:49,491 --> 02:15:51,567
What's your name?

916
02:17:03,605 --> 02:17:05,682
We were a family.

917
02:17:08,944 --> 02:17:11,517
How'd it break up and come apart?

918
02:17:14,783 --> 02:17:18,282
So that now we're turned against each other.

919
02:17:20,164 --> 02:17:22,737
Each standing in the other's light.

920
02:17:31,966 --> 02:17:34,588
How did we lose the good that was given us?

921
02:17:36,387 --> 02:17:38,464
Let it slip away?

922
02:17:41,267 --> 02:17:43,344
Scatter it careless?

923
02:18:04,039 --> 02:18:06,447
What's keeping us from reaching out?

924
02:18:07,084 --> 02:18:09,161
Touching the glory?

925
02:18:11,213 --> 02:18:14,961
I'd have had you, Witt, if you was a Jap,

926
02:18:15,049 --> 02:18:17,126
long ago.

927
02:18:18,720 --> 02:18:20,797
They leave you here?

928
02:18:22,348 --> 02:18:23,808
Yup.

929
02:18:23,892 --> 02:18:25,968
I slowed 'em up.

930
02:18:26,644 --> 02:18:28,555
Don't mind, really.

931
02:18:29,565 --> 02:18:32,352
The medic fixed me up pretty good.

932
02:18:32,484 --> 02:18:34,560
I got plenty of ammo.

933
02:18:37,239 --> 02:18:39,859
Somebody'll be along for me eventually.

934
02:18:44,954 --> 02:18:47,243
- They got you good.
- Right in the knee.

935
02:18:47,331 --> 02:18:49,039
Yeah.

936
02:18:49,125 --> 02:18:51,698
I'm out of this war for good, Witt.

937
02:18:57,008 --> 02:19:00,590
- What you doin' down here?
- Just, you know,

938
02:19:00,678 --> 02:19:02,967
I'm heading back to the company.

939
02:19:03,640 --> 02:19:05,299
Yeah.

940
02:19:06,142 --> 02:19:08,430
Well, you give all them boys my best.

941
02:19:08,519 --> 02:19:10,974
You can come with me if you want.

942
02:19:11,063 --> 02:19:13,186
I'll help you along.

943
02:19:14,817 --> 02:19:17,391
No, it's nice and quiet.

944
02:19:17,486 --> 02:19:19,562
Peaceful up here.

945
02:19:21,949 --> 02:19:25,116
I'd just slow you up.
There'll be somebody along.

946
02:19:28,998 --> 02:19:31,073
I'll remind 'em.

947
02:19:31,542 --> 02:19:33,617
OK.

948
02:21:08,845 --> 02:21:10,921
Hey, Witt.

949
02:21:15,476 --> 02:21:17,634
Who you making trouble for today?

950
02:21:18,688 --> 02:21:20,764
What d'you mean?

951
02:21:21,524 --> 02:21:24,691
Well, isn't that what you like to do?

952
02:21:24,777 --> 02:21:27,446
Turn left when they say go right?

953
02:21:34,245 --> 02:21:36,735
Why are you such a troublemaker, Witt?

954
02:21:39,166 --> 02:21:41,704
You care about me, dont you, Sergeant?

955
02:21:43,086 --> 02:21:45,163
I always felt like you did.

956
02:21:47,007 --> 02:21:49,712
Why do you always
make yourself out like a rock?

957
02:21:51,011 --> 02:21:53,383
One day I can come up and talk to you,

958
02:21:54,431 --> 02:21:58,298
by the next day it's like we never even met.

959
02:22:12,658 --> 02:22:14,733
Lonely house now.

960
02:22:17,412 --> 02:22:19,488
You ever get lonely?

961
02:22:19,581 --> 02:22:21,656
Only around people.

962
02:22:23,584 --> 02:22:25,661
Only around people.

963
02:22:30,299 --> 02:22:33,715
You still believing in the beautiful light,
are you?

964
02:22:41,309 --> 02:22:43,386
How do you do that?

965
02:22:45,064 --> 02:22:47,140
You're a magician to me.

966
02:22:56,199 --> 02:22:58,275
I still see a spark in you.

967
02:23:23,560 --> 02:23:29,100
One man looks at a dying bird and
thinks there's nothing but unanswered pain.

968
02:23:31,818 --> 02:23:33,894
But death's got the final word.

969
02:23:36,990 --> 02:23:39,065
It's laughing at him.

970
02:23:48,375 --> 02:23:50,866
Another man sees that same bird,

971
02:23:53,797 --> 02:23:55,873
feels the glory.

972
02:24:00,929 --> 02:24:03,421
Feels something smiling through him.

973
02:25:00,738 --> 02:25:03,193
We need to get out of here right now.

974
02:25:03,282 --> 02:25:07,860
- You explain to... headquarters the situation?
- No.

975
02:25:07,954 --> 02:25:12,033
Do they know where we are?
Cos we're sitting ducks out here.

976
02:25:13,208 --> 02:25:16,743
Well, I think thats...
up to me to judge, Sergeant.

977
02:25:18,380 --> 02:25:23,967
I think we just need to send somebody
up there and find out how close they are. OK?

978
02:25:24,052 --> 02:25:25,926
It's easy.

979
02:25:26,013 --> 02:25:29,381
Hey, Weld...
get headquarters on that thing.

980
02:25:29,475 --> 02:25:31,384
The fire's coming closer, sir.

981
02:25:31,476 --> 02:25:32,507
Line's cut!

982
02:25:35,521 --> 02:25:39,685
We need to send somebody out there
to find out where that line is being cut.

983
02:25:39,776 --> 02:25:42,397
And we need to find out how close they are.

984
02:25:42,486 --> 02:25:44,029
Come on.

985
02:25:44,114 --> 02:25:46,651
OK. OK.

986
02:25:50,787 --> 02:25:52,863
Hey, you.

987
02:25:53,498 --> 02:25:54,743
You go.

988
02:25:55,750 --> 02:25:57,410
You're going, Fife.

989
02:26:03,049 --> 02:26:06,049
Coombs. You go, too.

990
02:26:06,135 --> 02:26:07,795
Come on!

991
02:26:07,886 --> 02:26:12,430
I'll go. I want you to know
I think the whole thing's a bad idea, though.

992
02:26:12,516 --> 02:26:17,558
If they come down here in any strength,
Lieutenant, they'll knock our position to hell.

993
02:26:17,647 --> 02:26:20,102
You don't have to go. Others'll volunteer.

994
02:26:20,191 --> 02:26:25,315
No, I wanna go, sir. In case
something bad happens, I wanna be there.

995
02:26:25,404 --> 02:26:27,894
All right. You stay by the river.

996
02:26:27,990 --> 02:26:30,907
That jungle's too thick.
And be very careful.

997
02:26:30,993 --> 02:26:33,068
I will.

998
02:26:33,161 --> 02:26:35,118
Good luck, Witt.

999
02:26:35,204 --> 02:26:37,328
You OK, Fife?

1000
02:28:04,459 --> 02:28:07,080
A reinforce battalion.

1001
02:28:08,672 --> 02:28:10,331
We need to go back.

1002
02:28:10,423 --> 02:28:12,296
Tell the lieutenant.

1003
02:28:16,096 --> 02:28:17,969
Let's go.

1004
02:28:35,238 --> 02:28:37,314
I'm hit!

1005
02:29:36,256 --> 02:29:39,044
One of us needs to stay here
and hold 'em off.

1006
02:29:46,182 --> 02:29:48,259
We'll be all right.

1007
02:29:53,273 --> 02:29:56,274
My friend here doesn't have long,

1008
02:29:56,360 --> 02:29:59,277
so... you go.

1009
02:30:00,489 --> 02:30:01,947
You go on ahead.

1010
02:30:25,179 --> 02:30:27,255
Witt!

1011
02:31:13,059 --> 02:31:15,135
They're coming.

1012
02:31:16,604 --> 02:31:19,938
I gotta go. I don't want you to be afraid.

1013
02:31:20,692 --> 02:31:24,855
Just hide out here till you hear firing,
then push on down the river.

1014
02:31:24,946 --> 02:31:26,405
No.

1015
02:32:06,653 --> 02:32:10,318
- Where's Coombs?
- Get back. Get back, they're coming.

1016
02:32:11,282 --> 02:32:13,358
Fall back.

1017
02:32:14,870 --> 02:32:17,408
Where's Witt? Fife, where's Witt?

1018
02:32:23,628 --> 02:32:25,703
Fife, where's Witt?

1019
02:32:29,426 --> 02:32:32,426
Fife. Fife, where's Witt?

1020
02:34:15,737 --> 02:34:17,611
America.

1021
02:37:06,821 --> 02:37:08,897
Where's your spark now?

1022
02:37:31,636 --> 02:37:35,717
Now, I know you men have been
making and drinking this goddamn swipe.

1023
02:37:35,808 --> 02:37:37,053
That's OK by me.

1024
02:37:37,142 --> 02:37:38,850
Everything a lie.

1025
02:37:38,935 --> 02:37:42,601
Any man in my outfit
can get as drunk as he wants to every night.

1026
02:37:42,690 --> 02:37:44,813
Everything you hear and see.

1027
02:37:44,900 --> 02:37:49,064
As long as he's in shape to make reveille
and carry out any assignment given.

1028
02:37:49,154 --> 02:37:53,021
If he can't do that,
he's gonna have trouble from me.

1029
02:37:53,117 --> 02:37:56,948
- So much to spew out.
- I prefer to think of myself as a family man,

1030
02:37:57,036 --> 02:38:00,240
and that's what we all are here,
whether we like it or not.

1031
02:38:00,331 --> 02:38:02,408
We are a family.

1032
02:38:03,501 --> 02:38:05,659
I'm the father.

1033
02:38:06,337 --> 02:38:09,422
Guess that makes
Sergeant Welsh here the mother.

1034
02:38:09,506 --> 02:38:12,212
They just keep coming, one after another.

1035
02:38:12,301 --> 02:38:15,587
That makes you all the
children in this family.

1036
02:38:15,680 --> 02:38:19,214
Now, a family can have only one head,
and that is the father.

1037
02:38:19,308 --> 02:38:23,970
Father's the head, mother runs it.
That's the way it's gonna work here.

1038
02:38:24,063 --> 02:38:27,764
- If any of you wanna see me about anything,
- You're in a box.

1039
02:38:27,858 --> 02:38:29,981
- anything at all,
- A moving box.

1040
02:38:30,069 --> 02:38:32,145
you will find that I am available.

1041
02:38:32,238 --> 02:38:35,192
This war is not gonna be over
by next Christmas.

1042
02:38:35,283 --> 02:38:38,235
It's gonna be a long time
before we get home...

1043
02:38:38,328 --> 02:38:40,403
They want you dead.

1044
02:38:42,789 --> 02:38:44,865
Or in their lie.

1045
02:38:50,088 --> 02:38:52,164
Only one thing a man can do.

1046
02:38:55,176 --> 02:38:57,253
Find something that's his.

1047
02:39:00,515 --> 02:39:02,591
Make an island for himself.

1048
02:39:16,072 --> 02:39:18,564
If I never meet you in this life,

1049
02:39:19,993 --> 02:39:22,069
let me feel the lack.

1050
02:39:30,627 --> 02:39:35,041
A glance from your eyes,
and my life will be yours.

1051
02:40:24,180 --> 02:40:28,225
Somethin' I can come back to.
Some kind of foundation.

1052
02:40:28,393 --> 02:40:32,971
I mean, I don't know what, you know,
what your plans are, but...

1053
02:40:33,064 --> 02:40:37,013
I'm determined now.
I've been through the thick and thin of it.

1054
02:40:37,110 --> 02:40:40,443
You know, I may be young,
but I've lived plenty of life.

1055
02:40:41,155 --> 02:40:43,397
I'm ready to start living it good.

1056
02:40:43,491 --> 02:40:48,449
You know, my daddy always told me it's
gonna get a lot worse before it gets better.

1057
02:40:48,537 --> 02:40:53,079
You know, cos life ain't supposed to be
that hard when you're young.

1058
02:40:53,166 --> 02:40:56,832
Well, I figure after this
the worst is gonna be gone.

1059
02:40:57,546 --> 02:41:01,128
It's time for things to get better.
That's what I want.

1060
02:41:02,134 --> 02:41:04,210
That's what's gonna happen.

1061
02:41:05,345 --> 02:41:07,422
I'm getting older now.

1062
02:41:08,264 --> 02:41:10,755
By no means old, but older.

1063
02:41:11,560 --> 02:41:14,726
Where is it that we were together?

1064
02:41:17,899 --> 02:41:20,188
Who were you that I lived with?

1065
02:41:24,906 --> 02:41:26,982
Walked with?

1066
02:41:34,124 --> 02:41:36,199
The brother.

1067
02:41:42,715 --> 02:41:44,791
The friend.

1068
02:42:11,117 --> 02:42:13,194
Darkness from light.

1069
02:42:14,705 --> 02:42:16,780
Strife from love.

1070
02:42:17,958 --> 02:42:21,077
Are they the workings of one mind?

1071
02:42:22,462 --> 02:42:25,214
The features of the same face?

1072
02:42:40,105 --> 02:42:42,181
Oh, my soul,

1073
02:42:43,816 --> 02:42:45,892
let me be in you now.

1074
02:42:51,950 --> 02:42:54,238
Look out through my eyes.

1075
02:42:55,536 --> 02:42:58,027
Look out at the things you made.

1076
02:43:02,960 --> 02:43:05,249
All things shining.
