00:02:03,776 --> 00:02:05,710
Narrator:
People are always asking me

2
00:02:05,778 --> 00:02:07,370
if I know Tyler Durden.

3
00:02:07,446 --> 00:02:08,147
Tyler: 3 minutes.

4
00:02:08,147 --> 00:02:09,171
Tyler: 3 minutes.

5
00:02:09,248 --> 00:02:12,342
This is it: ground zero.

6
00:02:12,418 --> 00:02:14,511
Would you like to say a few
words to mark the occasion?

7
00:02:14,586 --> 00:02:15,678
[Muffled]

8
00:02:15,754 --> 00:02:17,551
Narrator: With a gun barrel
between your teeth,

9
00:02:17,623 --> 00:02:19,682
you speak only in vowels.

10
00:02:19,758 --> 00:02:21,020
I can't think
of anything.

11
00:02:21,093 --> 00:02:22,685
For a second
I totally forget

12
00:02:22,761 --> 00:02:25,286
about Tyler's whole
controlled demolition thing,

13
00:02:25,364 --> 00:02:27,525
and I wonder
how clean that gun is.

14
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,362
Tyler: Getting
exciting now.

15
00:02:29,435 --> 00:02:30,459
That old saying,

16
00:02:30,536 --> 00:02:32,697
how you always hurt
the one you love?

17
00:02:32,771 --> 00:02:34,959
Well, it works both ways.

18
00:02:35,093 --> 00:02:35,650
[Police Sirens]

19
00:02:35,727 --> 00:02:37,160
We have front row seats

20
00:02:37,228 --> 00:02:39,253
for this theater
of mass destruction.

21
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,662
The demolitions committee
of Project Mayhem

22
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:44,167
wrapped the foundation
columns of a dozen buildings

23
00:02:44,235 --> 00:02:47,170
with blasting gelatin.
In 2 minutes,

24
00:02:47,238 --> 00:02:49,172
primary charges
will blow base charges

25
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,502
and a few square blocks

26
00:02:50,575 --> 00:02:53,271
will be reduced
to smoldering rubble.

27
00:02:53,344 --> 00:02:54,402
I know this...

28
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,174
because Tyler knows this.

29
00:02:56,247 --> 00:02:57,839
2 1 /2.

30
00:02:57,915 --> 00:02:59,815
Think of everything
we've accomplished.

31
00:02:59,884 --> 00:03:02,876
And suddenly, I realize
that all of this:

32
00:03:02,954 --> 00:03:05,445
the gun, the bombs,
the revolution...

33
00:03:05,523 --> 00:03:08,981
has got something to do with
a girl named Marla Singer.

34
00:03:10,528 --> 00:03:13,554
Bob. Bob had bitch-tits.

35
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:17,624
This was a support group for
men with testicular cancer.

36
00:03:17,702 --> 00:03:20,136
The big moosey
slobbering all over me,

37
00:03:20,204 --> 00:03:21,193
that was Bob.

38
00:03:21,272 --> 00:03:23,433
We're still men.

39
00:03:23,508 --> 00:03:25,499
Yes, we're men.

40
00:03:25,576 --> 00:03:28,010
Men is what we are.

41
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:30,138
8 months ago, Bob's
testicles were removed.

42
00:03:30,214 --> 00:03:33,706
Then hormone therapy.
He developed bitch-tits

43
00:03:33,785 --> 00:03:35,776
because his testosterone
was too high,

44
00:03:35,853 --> 00:03:37,650
and his body
upped the estrogen.

45
00:03:37,722 --> 00:03:38,984
And that was where I fit...

46
00:03:39,057 --> 00:03:40,991
They're gonna have to
open up my pecks again

47
00:03:41,059 --> 00:03:42,083
and drain the fluid.

48
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,991
Narrator: Between those huge,
sweating tits

49
00:03:44,062 --> 00:03:47,429
that hung enormous the way
you'd think of Gods as big.

50
00:03:47,498 --> 00:03:50,592
OK. You cry now.

51
00:03:50,668 --> 00:03:54,160
No, wait. Back up.
Let me start earlier.

52
00:03:54,405 --> 00:03:57,238
For 6 months,
I couldn't sleep.

53
00:03:57,308 --> 00:03:59,868
Echo: I couldn't sleep.
I couldn't sleep.

54
00:03:59,944 --> 00:04:02,105
With insomnia,
nothing's real.

55
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,774
Everything's far away.

56
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:09,650
Everything's a copy
of a copy of a copy.

57
00:04:12,523 --> 00:04:14,787
When deep space
exploration ramps up,

58
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:17,555
it'll be the corporations
that names everything:

59
00:04:17,628 --> 00:04:20,119
the I.B.M. Stellar sphere,

60
00:04:20,198 --> 00:04:22,132
the Microsoft Galaxy,

61
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,760
Planet Starbucks.

62
00:04:24,836 --> 00:04:26,463
Gonna need you out of town
a little more this week.

63
00:04:26,537 --> 00:04:27,970
We got some
red flags to cover.

64
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:29,438
It must've been Tuesday.

65
00:04:29,507 --> 00:04:31,634
He was wearing
his cornflower-blue tie.

66
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:33,802
You want me to deprioritize
my current reports

67
00:04:33,878 --> 00:04:36,278
until you advise
of a status upgrade?

68
00:04:36,347 --> 00:04:38,144
Make these your primary
action items.

69
00:04:38,216 --> 00:04:39,308
Here's
your flight coupons.

70
00:04:39,383 --> 00:04:40,941
Call me from the road
if there's any snags.

71
00:04:41,018 --> 00:04:42,485
Narrator:
He was full of pep.

72
00:04:42,553 --> 00:04:45,750
Must have had
his grandee latte enema.

73
00:04:47,058 --> 00:04:49,652
Like so many others,
I had become a slave

74
00:04:49,727 --> 00:04:51,991
to the IKEA
nesting instinct.

75
00:04:52,063 --> 00:04:55,965
Uh, yes. I'd like to order
the Erica Pekkary dust ruffles.

76
00:04:56,033 --> 00:04:57,000
Operator: Please hold.

77
00:04:57,068 --> 00:04:58,330
If I saw something clever

78
00:04:58,402 --> 00:05:01,394
Like a little coffee table
in the shape of a yin-yang,

79
00:05:01,472 --> 00:05:03,269
I had to have it.

80
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:06,174
The Klipske
personal of fice unit,

81
00:05:06,244 --> 00:05:08,712
the Hovetrekke
home exert-bike,

82
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:10,440
or the Johannshamn sofa

83
00:05:10,515 --> 00:05:12,779
with the Strinne green
stripe pattern.

84
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,784
Even the Rizlampa wire lamps

85
00:05:14,852 --> 00:05:17,946
of environmentally friendly
unbleached paper.

86
00:05:18,022 --> 00:05:19,853
I'd flip through catalogs
and wonder:

87
00:05:19,924 --> 00:05:23,951
What kind of dining set
defines me as a person?

88
00:05:24,028 --> 00:05:25,393
I had it all.

89
00:05:25,463 --> 00:05:26,657
Even the glass dishes

90
00:05:26,731 --> 00:05:28,631
with tiny bubbles
and imperfections.

91
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,793
Proof  that they were crafted
by the honest, simple,

92
00:05:31,869 --> 00:05:33,632
hard-working indigenous
peoples of --

Operator: Please hold.

94
00:05:34,705 --> 00:05:35,637
Narrator: Wherever.

95
00:05:35,706 --> 00:05:37,003
I was holding.

96
00:05:37,074 --> 00:05:39,668
We used to read pornography.

97
00:05:39,744 --> 00:05:41,803
Now it was
the Horchow collection.

98
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:44,871
No, you can't
die from insomnia.

99
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:46,041
What about narcolepsy?

100
00:05:46,117 --> 00:05:49,052
I nod of f. I wake up
in strange places.

101
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,678
I have no idea
how I got there.

102
00:05:50,755 --> 00:05:52,484
You need to lighten up.

103
00:05:52,557 --> 00:05:54,821
Can you please just
get me something?

104
00:05:54,892 --> 00:05:58,089
Narrator: Red and blue Tuenois,
lipstick-red Seconais.

105
00:05:58,162 --> 00:06:02,792
No. You need
healthy natural sleep.

106
00:06:02,867 --> 00:06:06,428
Chew some Valerian root
and get more exercise.

107
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,604
Hey, come on.
I'm in pain.

108
00:06:11,676 --> 00:06:13,439
You wanna see pain?

00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:15,240
Swing by First Methodist
Tuesday nights.

110
00:06:15,313 --> 00:06:18,407
See the guys
with testicular cancer.

111
00:06:18,482 --> 00:06:20,109
That's pain.

00:06:36,033 --> 00:06:37,898
I always wanted 3 kids,

2 boys and a girl.

116
00:06:39,971 --> 00:06:43,873
Mindy wanted
2 girls and a boy.

117
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:46,876
We never could
agree on anything.

118
00:06:46,944 --> 00:06:48,912
Well, uh,
you know, she--

119
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,540
She had her first child
last week, a...

120
00:06:51,616 --> 00:06:53,345
a girl.

121
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:56,978

with her new husband.

Man: [Whispering] Fuck.

123

Hey--Hey, thank God,
you know.

124
00:07:03,661 --> 00:07:06,027
I'm--I'm glad for her.

125
00:07:06,097 --> 00:07:10,466
Because she deserves it.

126
00:07:10,534 --> 00:07:13,094
Group Leader: Aw.

127
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:16,731
Everyone, let's thank Thomas
for sharing himself with us.

128
00:07:16,807 --> 00:07:19,105
All: Thank you, Thomas.

129
00:07:19,176 --> 00:07:22,441
I look around this room,
and I see a lot of  courage,

130
00:07:22,513 --> 00:07:24,606
and that gives me strength.

131
00:07:24,682 --> 00:07:27,048
We give each other strength.

132
00:07:27,118 --> 00:07:29,052
It's time
for the one-on-ones.

133
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,918
So let's all of  us here
follow Thomas' good example

134
00:07:31,989 --> 00:07:34,423
and really open ourselves up.

135
00:07:34,492 --> 00:07:36,790
Would you find a partner?

136
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,294
Narrator: And this is how
I met the big moosey...

137
00:07:41,365 --> 00:07:43,492
Man: Come on.
Let's go over here.

138
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:46,798
His eyes already
shrink-wrapped in tears...

139
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:52,475
knees together,
those awkward little steps.

140
00:07:57,381 --> 00:07:58,473
My name is Bob.

141
00:07:58,549 --> 00:07:59,982
Bob.

142
00:08:00,051 --> 00:08:02,576
Narrator: Bob had been
a champion body-builder.

143
00:08:02,653 --> 00:08:04,587
You know that
chest-expansion program

144
00:08:04,655 --> 00:08:07,749
you see on late-night TV ?
That was his idea.

145
00:08:07,825 --> 00:08:09,588
I was a juicer.

146
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,255
You know,
using steroids.

147
00:08:13,331 --> 00:08:16,061
Diabonal and...

148
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:18,601
Wistrol.
Oh, they use that

149
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:21,934
on racehorses,
for Christ sakes.

150
00:08:22,006 --> 00:08:24,770
And now I'm bankrupt.

151
00:08:24,842 --> 00:08:26,935
I'm divorced.

152
00:08:27,011 --> 00:08:30,447
My 2 grown kids...

153
00:08:30,514 --> 00:08:34,314
won't even return
my phone calls.

Narrator: Strangers
with this kind of honesty

155
00:08:36,153 --> 00:08:38,678
make me go
a big rubbery one.

156
00:08:41,025 --> 00:08:43,459
Go ahead, Cornelius.

157
00:08:43,527 --> 00:08:44,755

159
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:03,246
Narrator: And then,
something happened.

160
00:09:03,314 --> 00:09:04,747
I let go.

161
00:09:04,815 --> 00:09:06,282
That's really good.

162
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,341
Lost in oblivion...

163
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:11,582
dark and silent
and complete.

164
00:09:13,324 --> 00:09:15,087
I found freedom.

165
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:18,925
Losing all hope was freedom.

166
00:09:18,996 --> 00:09:20,930
It's OK.

167
00:09:24,235 --> 00:09:26,430

this well.

169
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,604
I became addicted.

Come on.

171
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,556
Narrator:
If I didn't say anything...

172
00:09:48,626 --> 00:09:50,457
people always
assumed the worst.

173
00:09:50,528 --> 00:09:51,460

00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:53,394
Second man: Welcome, Travis.

175
00:09:55,032 --> 00:09:57,296
They cried harder...

176
00:09:57,368 --> 00:09:59,598
then I cried harder.

362
00:17:54,154 --> 00:17:55,974
What, are you selling those?

363
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:57,837
Yes! I'm selling
some clothes.

364
00:17:57,909 --> 00:17:58,967
So,

365
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:00,375
we each have 3.
That's 6.

366
00:18:00,445 --> 00:18:02,675
What about the seventh day?
I want ascending bowel cancer.

367
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,181
Narrator: The girl
had done her homework.

368
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,181
Thank you.

369
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,182
No. No, l...

370
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,481
I want bowel cancer.

371
00:18:08,553 --> 00:18:10,282
That's your favorite, too?

372
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:12,585
Try to slip it by me, eh?

373
00:18:12,657 --> 00:18:14,124
Look, we're gonna
split it, OK?

374
00:18:14,192 --> 00:18:15,955
Take the first and third
Sunday of the month.

375
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:20,298
Deal.

376
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:24,802
Looks like
this is good-bye.

377
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,997
Well, let's not make a
big thing out of  it, OK?

378
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:28,937
How's this for not
making a big thing?

379
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:33,435
[Door Opens]

380
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:34,809
Hey, Marla!

381
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,812
[Horn Honks]

382
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:36,813
Marla!

383
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,476
May-Maybe we should
exchange numbers.

384
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:41,985
Should we?

385
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,022
W-We might want
to switch nights.

386
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,579
OK.

387
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:54,088
Narrator: This is how I met
Marla Singer.

388
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,100
[Humming]

389
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:57,465
Marla's philosophy of  life

390
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:59,595
was that she might die
at any moment.

391
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:02,367
The tragedy, she said,
was that she didn't.

392
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:03,601
It doesn't have
your name.

393
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:04,699
Who are you,

394
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,835
Cornelius,
Rupert,

395
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,243
Travis,

396
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,507
any of the
stupid names

397
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:10,741
you give each
night?

398
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:16,819
You wake up
at SeaTac.

399
00:19:16,888 --> 00:19:18,082
S.F.O...

400
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:20,181
L.A.X...

401
00:19:20,258 --> 00:19:22,089
You wake up at O'Hare...

402
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,650
Dallas-Fort Worth...

403
00:19:23,728 --> 00:19:25,696
B.W.I...

404
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:27,994
Pacific, mountain,
central...

405
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:29,624
Lose an hour,
gain an hour...

406
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,225
Check-in for that
flight doesn't begin

407
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:32,793
for another 2 hours,
sir.

408
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:36,898
This is your life, and it's
ending one minute at a time.

409
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,375
You wake up at Air Harbor
international...

410
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:41,378
P.A.: ...the aircraft has
come to a complete stop.

411
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,107
If you wake up
at a different time,

412
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:45,149
in a different place,

413
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,310
could you wake up
as a different person?

414
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,520
Everywhere I travel,

415
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:52,022
tiny life...

416
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,921
single-serving sugar...

417
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:55,118
single-serving cream...

418
00:19:55,193 --> 00:19:57,024
single pat of butter...

419
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:59,928
a microwave cordon-bleu
hobby kit.

420
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:01,966
Shampoo-conditioner combos.

421
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:05,264
Sample package mouthwash,
tiny bars of soap.

422
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,897
The people I meet
on each flight,

423
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:13,035
they're single-serving
friends.

424
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:15,909
Between takeoff and landing,
we have our time together,

425
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,245
but that's all we get.

426
00:20:18,316 --> 00:20:20,181
Together: Welcome!

427
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,378
Narrator: On
a long enough timeline,

428
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:25,980
the survival rate
for everyone drops to zero.

429
00:20:26,057 --> 00:20:28,116
I was a recall coordinator.

430
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:30,252
My job was
to apply the formula.

431
00:20:30,328 --> 00:20:31,260
Here's where
the infant

432
00:20:31,329 --> 00:20:32,626
went through
the windshield.

433
00:20:32,697 --> 00:20:33,686
3 points.

434
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:35,096
Narrator: A new car
built by my company

435
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,533
Ieaves somewhere traveling
at 60 miles per hour.

436
00:20:37,602 --> 00:20:40,093
The rear differential
locks up.

437
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,161
The teenager's braces

438
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:42,763
are wrapped around
the back seat ashtray.

439
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:45,105
Might make
a good antismoking ad.

440
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:46,610
Narrator:
The car crashes and burns

441
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:48,270
with everyone
trapped inside.

442
00:20:48,346 --> 00:20:50,837
Now, should we
initiate a recall?

443
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,110
The father
must've been huge.

444
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:53,344
You see
where the fat

445
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,578
has burned
to the seat,

446
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:56,143
the polyester shirt?

447
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,280
- Very modern art.
- Ha ha ha!

448
00:20:58,356 --> 00:21:01,325
Narrator: Take the number of 
vehicles in the field, "A,"

449
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:04,021
multiply it by the probable
rate of failure, " B,"

450
00:21:04,095 --> 00:21:05,119
then multiply the result

451
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,495
by the average out-of -court
settlement, "C."

452
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:10,296
"A" times " B" times "C"

453
00:21:10,368 --> 00:21:11,835
equals "X."

454
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:14,838
If "X" is less
than the cost of  a recall,

455
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:17,101
we don't do one.

456
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:18,403
Are there a lot

457
00:21:18,476 --> 00:21:20,376
of  these kinds
of  accidents?

458
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,310
You wouldn't believe.

459
00:21:24,115 --> 00:21:26,345
Which car company
do you work for?

460
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,080
A major one.

461
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:33,047
Narrator: Every time the plane
banked too sharply

462
00:21:33,124 --> 00:21:34,955
on takeoff or landing,

463
00:21:35,026 --> 00:21:36,891
I prayed for a crash

464
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,452
or a midair collision.

465
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,498
Anything.

466
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:44,868
[Screaming]

467
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:51,172
Life insurance
pays of f triple

468
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:52,733
if you die
on a business trip.

469
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,835
[Ding]

470
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:58,614
"If you are seated in an
emergency exit row..."

471
00:21:58,683 --> 00:21:59,877
Yeah...

472
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:01,543
"And you feel
you would be unable

473
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,019
or unwilling to
perform the duties

474
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:04,817
Listed on
the safety card,

475
00:22:04,889 --> 00:22:06,481
please ask
a flight attendant

476
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:07,490
to reseat you."

477
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:11,389
It's a lot
of  responsibility.

478
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:13,693
Wanna switch seats?

479
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,323
No. I'm not sure
I'm the man

480
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,231
for that particular job.

481
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:20,203
An exit-door procedure
at 30,000 feet.

482
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:21,830
Mm-hmm.

483
00:22:21,906 --> 00:22:23,840
The illusion of  safety.

484
00:22:23,908 --> 00:22:26,638
Yeah. I guess so.

485
00:22:26,711 --> 00:22:29,202
You know why they put
oxygen masks on planes?

486
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,010
So you can breathe.

487
00:22:31,082 --> 00:22:33,949
Oxygen gets you high.

488
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,452
In a catastrophic
emergency,

489
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,512
you're taking giant
panicked breaths.

490
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,150
Suddenly you become
euphoric, docile.

491
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:43,456
You accept your fate.

492
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,122
It's all right here.

493
00:22:46,197 --> 00:22:47,926
Emergency
water landing--

494
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:49,466
600 miles an hour.

495
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:50,558
Blank faces,

496
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:52,296
calm as Hindu cows.

497
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,395
That's, um...

498
00:22:54,472 --> 00:22:57,498
That's an interesting
theory.

499
00:23:00,111 --> 00:23:01,442
What do you do?

500
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:02,946
What do you mean?

501
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:04,276
What do you do
for a living?

502
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:07,477
Why? So you can pretend
like you're interested?

503
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,076
[Laughs]

504
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:11,347
OK.

505
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:13,254
You have a kind of 
sick desperation

506
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:14,553
in your laugh.

507
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:19,889
We have
the exact same briefcase.

508
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,793
Soap.

509
00:23:22,867 --> 00:23:23,799
Sorry?

510
00:23:23,868 --> 00:23:26,598
I make
and I sell soap--

511
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:29,504
the yard stick
of  civilization.

512
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,303
Narrator: And this is
how I met...

513
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:33,071
"Tyler Durden."

514
00:23:33,144 --> 00:23:34,975
Did you know, if you
mixed equal parts

515
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:36,946
of  gasoline and frozen
or angejuice concentrate,

516
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:38,812
you can make napalm?

517
00:23:38,883 --> 00:23:40,714
No, I did not know that.
Is that true?

518
00:23:40,785 --> 00:23:41,843
That's right.

519
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,512
One can make all kinds
of  explosives

520
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,385
using simple
household items.

521
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:46,549
Really?

522
00:23:46,624 --> 00:23:48,251
If one were
so inclined.

523
00:23:52,997 --> 00:23:55,693
Tyler, you are, by far,
the most interesting

524
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,292
"single-serving" friend
I've ever met.

525
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,167
See, obviously,

526
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:02,103
everything on a plane
is single-serving, even--

527
00:24:02,173 --> 00:24:04,368
Oh, I get it.
It's very clever.

528
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:06,000
Thank you.

529
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:08,841
How's that working out
for you?

530
00:24:08,913 --> 00:24:09,845
What?

531
00:24:09,914 --> 00:24:11,040
Being clever.

532
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,516
Great.

533
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:15,519
Keep it up, then.

534
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:16,519
Right up.

535
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,857
Now a question
of etiquette.

536
00:24:19,924 --> 00:24:21,016
As I pass,

537
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:22,525
do I give you the ass
or the crotch?

538
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:32,860
Narrator: How I came
to live with Tyler is...

539
00:24:32,937 --> 00:24:35,929
airlines have this policy
about vibrating luggage.

540
00:24:43,681 --> 00:24:45,114
Was--Was it ticking?

541
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:47,549
Actually, throwers don't
worry about ticking,

542

The gas was
just the detonator.

Who would go and do
such a thing?

to homemade dynamite?

- Enemies?
- Reject the basic

- Tonight?
- Yeah.

1344
01:00:10,948 --> 01:00:12,939
We make soap.

1345
01:00:13,017 --> 01:00:14,109
Really.

1346
01:00:14,185 --> 01:00:15,243
To make soap,
first we render fat.

1347
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:37,664
The salt balance
has to be just right,

1348
01:00:37,734 --> 01:00:40,430
so the best fat for making
soap comes from humans.

Get another one.
Unhh!

1357
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:24,272
As the fat renders, the tallows
float to the surface.

If you were to add nitric
acid, you got nitroglycerin.

1364
01:01:38,662 --> 01:01:39,924
If you were then to add
sodium nitrate

1365
01:01:39,997 --> 01:01:42,625
and a dash of sawdust,
you got dynamite.

1366

Yeah, with enough soap,

1367
01:01:44,568 --> 01:01:46,866
we could blow up
just about anything.

Narrator: Tyler was full
of useful information.

into the wood and ashes

to create lye.

1376
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,853
This is lye,
the crucial ingredient.

1377
01:02:07,925 --> 01:02:09,654
Once it mixed with the
melted fat of bodies,

1378
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,193
a thick, white,
soapy discharge

1379

01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:41,892
What are you doing?

1786
01:21:41,961 --> 01:21:42,893
Meet me in the back.

1787
01:21:42,962 --> 01:21:44,395
Hey, don't fuck around.

1788
01:21:44,464 --> 01:21:45,692
Meet me in the back.

1789
01:21:45,765 --> 01:21:47,892
Narrator: On a long enough
time line,

1790
01:21:47,967 --> 01:21:50,333
the survival rate
for everyone drops to zero.

1791
01:21:51,471 --> 01:21:53,439
What are you doing?
Come on.

1792
01:21:53,506 --> 01:21:54,871
Hands behind your back.

1793
01:21:54,941 --> 01:21:55,873
God.

1794
01:21:55,942 --> 01:21:57,034
Give me your wallet.

1795
01:21:58,311 --> 01:21:59,642
Raymond K. Hessel,

1796
01:21:59,712 --> 01:22:02,704
1 320 Southeast Banning,
apartment A.

1797
01:22:02,782 --> 01:22:04,113
Small, cramped basement
apartment, Raymond?

1798
01:22:04,183 --> 01:22:05,207
How did you know?

1799
01:22:05,285 --> 01:22:06,912
Because they give
shitty basement apartments

1800
01:22:06,986 --> 01:22:08,920
Letters instead of numbers.

1801
01:22:08,988 --> 01:22:10,421
Raymond...

1802
01:22:10,490 --> 01:22:11,923
you're going to die.

1803
01:22:11,991 --> 01:22:13,458
[Crying]
Oh, my God, no...

1804
01:22:13,526 --> 01:22:14,720
Is that your mom and dad?

1805
01:22:14,794 --> 01:22:16,284
Mom and dad are going
to have to call up

1806
01:22:16,362 --> 01:22:17,351
kindly Dr. So-And-So

1807
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:18,829
to pick up
your dental records.

1808
01:22:18,898 --> 01:22:20,092
You want to know why?

1809
01:22:20,166 --> 01:22:21,895
Because there's going to be
nothing left of your face.

1810
01:22:21,968 --> 01:22:23,731
- Aw, come on.
- [Crying]

1811
01:22:23,803 --> 01:22:26,237
An expired community college
student I.D.

1812
01:22:26,306 --> 01:22:27,739
What'd you study, Raymond?

1813
01:22:27,807 --> 01:22:29,365
S-S-S-Stuff.

1814
01:22:29,442 --> 01:22:30,841
Stuff?

1815
01:22:30,910 --> 01:22:33,037
Were the midterms hard?

1816
01:22:33,112 --> 01:22:34,079
[Whimpering]

1817
01:22:34,147 --> 01:22:35,512
I asked you
what you studied.

1818
01:22:35,581 --> 01:22:36,707
Biology, mostly.

1819
01:22:36,783 --> 01:22:37,909
Why?

1820
01:22:37,984 --> 01:22:39,884
I--I don't know.

1821
01:22:39,952 --> 01:22:43,353
What did you want to be,
Raymond K. Hessel?

1822
01:22:43,423 --> 01:22:44,754
[Click]

1823
01:22:44,824 --> 01:22:46,951
The question, Raymond,

1824
01:22:47,026 --> 01:22:50,416
was what did you
want to be?

1825
01:22:50,550 --> 01:22:52,381
Answer him,
Raymond! Jesus!

1826
01:22:52,452 --> 01:22:53,851
Veterinarian!
Veterinarian!

1827
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:54,978
Animals.

1828
01:22:55,054 --> 01:22:56,988
Yeah, animal s-s-s--

1829
01:22:57,056 --> 01:22:58,080
Stuff.
Yeah, I got that.

1830
01:22:58,157 --> 01:22:59,215
That means you have to
get more schooling.

1831
01:22:59,292 --> 01:23:00,725
Too much school.

1832
01:23:00,793 --> 01:23:02,158
Would you rather be dead?

1833
01:23:02,228 --> 01:23:03,160
No...

1834
01:23:03,229 --> 01:23:04,457
Would you
rather die, here,

1835
01:23:04,530 --> 01:23:05,963
on your knees,

1836
01:23:06,032 --> 01:23:07,829
in the back
of a convenience store?

1837
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:09,458
[Whimpering]
No...No, please...

1838
01:23:09,535 --> 01:23:10,797
no...

1839
01:23:10,870 --> 01:23:12,565
[Releases Hammer]

1840
01:23:14,073 --> 01:23:15,631
I'm keeping your license.

1841
01:23:16,909 --> 01:23:18,467
Gonna check in on you.

1842
01:23:18,544 --> 01:23:20,478
I know where you live.

1843
01:23:20,546 --> 01:23:23,481
If youre not on your way
to becoming a veterinarian

1844
01:23:23,549 --> 01:23:25,176
in 6 weeks,
you will be dead.

1845
01:23:25,251 --> 01:23:26,980
[Whimpering]

1846
01:23:27,053 --> 01:23:28,884
Now run on home.

1847
01:23:33,659 --> 01:23:35,957
Run, Forrest, run!

1848
01:23:37,597 --> 01:23:38,962
I feel ill.

1849
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,233
Imagine how he feels.

1850
01:23:42,301 --> 01:23:44,235
Come on,
this isn't funny!

1851
01:23:44,303 --> 01:23:45,736
That wasn't funny.

1852
01:23:45,805 --> 01:23:47,830
What the fuck
was the point of that?

1853
01:23:47,907 --> 01:23:49,340
Tomorrow will be
the most beautiful day

1854
01:23:49,408 --> 01:23:50,841
of  Raymond K. Hessel's life.

1855
01:23:50,910 --> 01:23:52,343
His breakfast
will taste better

1856
01:23:52,411 --> 01:23:55,312
than any meal you and I
have ever tasted.

1857
01:23:56,849 --> 01:23:59,443
Narrator: You had to
give it to him.

1858
01:23:59,519 --> 01:24:00,850
Come on.

1859
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:01,887
He had a plan.

1860
01:24:01,954 --> 01:24:03,888
And it started
to make sense

1861
01:24:03,956 --> 01:24:05,321
in a Tyler sort of way.

1862
01:24:05,391 --> 01:24:06,380
No fear.

1863
01:24:06,459 --> 01:24:08,393
No distractions.

1864
01:24:08,461 --> 01:24:11,828
The ability to let
that which does not matter

1865
01:24:11,898 --> 01:24:13,866
truly slide.

1866
01:24:26,012 --> 01:24:27,639
You're not your job.

1867
01:24:29,882 --> 01:24:33,147
You're not how much money
you have in the bank.

1868
01:24:34,887 --> 01:24:37,651
You're not
the car you drive.

1869
01:24:37,723 --> 01:24:40,317
You're not the contents
of your wallet.

1870
01:24:41,794 --> 01:24:43,819
You're not
your fuckin' khakis.

1871
01:24:46,032 --> 01:24:49,468
You're the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.

1872
01:24:58,511 --> 01:25:01,446
I'll be out of your way
in a sec.

1873
01:25:01,514 --> 01:25:02,981
You don't have to go.

1874
01:25:05,084 --> 01:25:06,176
Whatever.

1875
01:25:07,253 --> 01:25:10,188
No, I mean, uh...

1876
01:25:10,256 --> 01:25:11,484
It's OK.

1877
01:25:20,933 --> 01:25:23,800
Are you still going
to groups?

1878
01:25:23,869 --> 01:25:24,961
Yeah.

1879
01:25:27,139 --> 01:25:28,970
Chloe's dead.

1880
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:31,737
Ah, Chloe.

1881
01:25:31,811 --> 01:25:33,972
When did that happen?

1882
01:25:34,046 --> 01:25:36,446
do you care?

1883
01:25:36,515 --> 01:25:37,812
I don't know.

1884
01:25:37,883 --> 01:25:40,078
I haven't thought
about it in a while.

1885
01:25:40,152 --> 01:25:42,416
Yeah, well...

1886
01:25:42,488 --> 01:25:45,616
I think it was
a smart move on her part.

1887
01:25:46,759 --> 01:25:48,090
Hey, listen, uh...

1888
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:51,823
what are you getting
out of all this?

1889
01:25:51,897 --> 01:25:53,057
What?

1890
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:55,733
I mean, all this.

1891
01:25:55,801 --> 01:25:57,234
Why do you keep...

1892
01:25:57,303 --> 01:25:59,771
Is this
making you happy?

1893
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:03,465
Yeah, well, sometimes.

1894
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:07,344
I don't know.
I don't understand.

1895
01:26:07,413 --> 01:26:09,347
Why does
a weaker person

1896
01:26:09,415 --> 01:26:11,849
need to latch on to
a strong person?

1897
01:26:11,917 --> 01:26:13,179
What is that?

1898
01:26:13,252 --> 01:26:15,379
Well, what do you
get out of it?

1899
01:26:17,323 --> 01:26:19,257
No--It's--It's not
the same thing at all.

1900
01:26:19,325 --> 01:26:21,190
I mean, we're...it's
totally different with us.

1901
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:22,352
We're--We're--

1902
01:26:22,428 --> 01:26:23,486
Us?

1903
01:26:23,562 --> 01:26:25,359
What do you mean by "us"?

1904
01:26:25,431 --> 01:26:27,160
I'm sorry,
do you hear this?

1905
01:26:27,233 --> 01:26:28,257
Hear what?

1906
01:26:28,334 --> 01:26:30,302
You're not hearing
all that noise?

1907
01:26:30,369 --> 01:26:31,301
Just--Hold on a second.

1908
01:26:31,370 --> 01:26:32,530
No, wait.
What were you saying?

1909
01:26:32,605 --> 01:26:34,266
Don't change the subject.
I want to talk about this.

1910
01:26:34,340 --> 01:26:36,035
You're not talking
about me, are you?

1911
01:26:36,108 --> 01:26:37,939
No. What?

1912
01:26:38,010 --> 01:26:39,807
That day you came over
to my place to play doctor--

1913
01:26:39,879 --> 01:26:41,471
what was going on there?

1914
01:26:41,547 --> 01:26:42,514
What are you
talking about?

1915
01:26:42,581 --> 01:26:44,014
Nothing. Nothing.

1916
01:26:44,083 --> 01:26:45,141
I don't think so.

1917
01:26:45,217 --> 01:26:46,479
Come on,
what do you want?

1918
01:26:46,552 --> 01:26:47,814
- Look at me.
- No. What?

1919
01:26:47,887 --> 01:26:49,650
Look at me.

1920
01:26:49,722 --> 01:26:51,155
What is that?

1921
01:26:51,223 --> 01:26:52,815
It's nothing.
Don't worry about it.

1922
01:26:52,892 --> 01:26:53,824
Oh, my God.

1923
01:26:53,893 --> 01:26:54,917
Who did this?

1924
01:26:54,994 --> 01:26:55,926
A person.

1925
01:26:55,995 --> 01:26:56,984
Guy or girl?

1926
01:26:57,063 --> 01:26:59,054
What do you care
if its a guy or a girl?

1927
01:26:59,131 --> 01:27:00,189
What do you care
if I ask?

1928
01:27:00,266 --> 01:27:01,426
This is none of your
business. Leave me alone.

1929
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:02,432
You're afraid to say it.

1930
01:27:02,501 --> 01:27:03,433
I am not afraid to say.
Let me go.

1931
01:27:03,502 --> 01:27:04,560
No! Talk to me.

1932
01:27:04,637 --> 01:27:05,831
- No!
- Let go of me. Leave me alone.

1933
01:27:05,905 --> 01:27:07,395
This conversation...

1934
01:27:07,473 --> 01:27:08,599
This conversation...

1935
01:27:08,674 --> 01:27:10,471
is over.

1936
01:27:10,543 --> 01:27:11,976
is over.

1937
01:27:13,145 --> 01:27:15,511
I just can't win
with you, can l?

1938
01:27:23,322 --> 01:27:26,257
Hey, this is getting
a little old.

1939
01:27:26,325 --> 01:27:27,792
[Doorbell]

1940
01:27:27,860 --> 01:27:30,055
What is--What is all this?

1941
01:27:30,129 --> 01:27:31,562
What do you think?

1942
01:27:32,998 --> 01:27:36,058
Hey, why do we need
bunk beds?

1943
01:27:36,135 --> 01:27:37,067
Hey.

1944
01:27:44,176 --> 01:27:45,734
Too young.

1945
01:27:45,811 --> 01:27:47,369
Sorry.

1946
01:27:47,446 --> 01:27:49,676
What's all that?

1947
01:27:49,749 --> 01:27:52,274
If the applicant is young,
tell him he's too young.

1948
01:27:52,351 --> 01:27:53,818
Old, too old.
Fat, too fat.

1949
01:27:53,886 --> 01:27:54,853
Applicant?

1950
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:56,785
If the applicant
then waits for 3 days

1951
01:27:56,856 --> 01:27:58,790
without food, shelter
or encouragement,

1952
01:27:58,858 --> 01:28:01,292
he may then enter
and begin his training.

1953
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:02,918
Training for what?

1954
01:28:08,067 --> 01:28:10,001
You think
this is a game?

1955
01:28:10,069 --> 01:28:12,003
You're too young
to train here.

1956
01:28:12,071 --> 01:28:14,005
End of story.
Quit wasting our time.

1957
01:28:14,073 --> 01:28:15,506
Get the fuck
out of here.

1958
01:28:20,112 --> 01:28:21,511
Bad news, friend.

1959
01:28:22,681 --> 01:28:24,615
It's not gonna happen.

1960
01:28:24,683 --> 01:28:27,618
I'm sorry if there was
a misunderstanding.

1961
01:28:27,686 --> 01:28:29,654
It's not the end
of the world.

1962
01:28:29,722 --> 01:28:31,155

01:38:30,305 --> 01:38:31,329
Should I e-mail you?

2142
01:38:31,406 --> 01:38:32,930
Should I put this
on your action item list?

2143
01:38:33,008 --> 01:38:34,498
You decide your own
level of involvement!

2144
01:38:34,576 --> 01:38:37,272
I will! I want to know
certain things first.

2145
01:38:37,345 --> 01:38:38,972
The first rule
of  Project Mayhem--

2146
01:38:39,047 --> 01:38:39,979
Shut up!

2147
01:38:40,048 --> 01:38:42,175
I want to know
what you're thinking.

2148
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:43,217
Fuck what you know.

2149
01:38:43,284 --> 01:38:44,512
You need to forget
about what you know.

2150
01:38:44,586 --> 01:38:45,518
That's your problem.

2151
01:38:45,587 --> 01:38:46,849
Forget about what
you think you know

2152
01:38:46,921 --> 01:38:48,718
about life,
about friendship,

2153
01:38:48,790 --> 01:38:51,156
and especially
about you and me.

2154
01:38:51,226 --> 01:38:52,193
What?

2155
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:54,524
What is that supposed
to mean? What...

2156
01:38:57,866 --> 01:38:58,798
What are you doing?

2157
01:39:01,002 --> 01:39:03,698
Guys, what do you wish
you'd done before you die?

2158
01:39:03,772 --> 01:39:04,796
Paint a self-portrait.

2159
01:39:04,873 --> 01:39:05,805
Build a house.

2160
01:39:05,874 --> 01:39:07,341
And you?

2161
01:39:07,409 --> 01:39:09,969
I don't know.
Get in the right lane.

2162
01:39:10,045 --> 01:39:11,637
I have to know the answer
to this question.

2163
01:39:11,713 --> 01:39:12,771
If you were to die
right now,

2164
01:39:12,847 --> 01:39:14,781
how would you feel
about your life?

2165
01:39:14,849 --> 01:39:15,873
I don't know!

2166
01:39:15,950 --> 01:39:17,144
I wouldn't feel anything
good about my life.

2167
01:39:17,218 --> 01:39:18,515
Is that what you want
to hear me say? Fine.

2168
01:39:18,586 --> 01:39:20,178
- Come on!
- Not good enough.

2169
01:39:20,255 --> 01:39:22,052
- [Honking]
- Stop fucking around!

2170
01:39:22,123 --> 01:39:23,385
Tyler!

2171
01:39:23,458 --> 01:39:25,483
[Honking]

2172
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:27,619
Jesus Christ!

2173
01:39:27,696 --> 01:39:28,822
Goddamn it!

2174
01:39:28,897 --> 01:39:30,455
Goddamn it!
Fuck you!

2175
01:39:30,532 --> 01:39:31,897
Fuck Fight Club.

2176
01:39:31,966 --> 01:39:34,628
Fuck Marla.
I'm sick of all your shit.

2177
01:39:34,703 --> 01:39:36,671
OK.

2178
01:39:36,738 --> 01:39:38,399
OK.

2179
01:39:38,473 --> 01:39:40,031
Quit screwing around.
Take the wheel.

2180
01:39:40,108 --> 01:39:41,040
Look at you.

2181
01:39:41,109 --> 01:39:42,041
Take the wheel!

2182
01:39:42,110 --> 01:39:43,873
Look at you!
You're fuckin' pathetic!

2183
01:39:43,945 --> 01:39:45,503
Why? Why?
What are you talking about?

2184
01:39:45,580 --> 01:39:49,038
Why do you think
I blew up your condo?

2185
01:39:50,151 --> 01:39:51,243
What?

2186
01:39:51,319 --> 01:39:53,344
Hitting bottom
isn't a weekend retreat.

2187
01:39:53,421 --> 01:39:55,252
It's not
a goddamn seminar.

2188
01:39:55,323 --> 01:39:57,257
Stop trying
to control everything

2189
01:39:57,325 --> 01:39:58,917
and just let go.

2190
01:40:00,762 --> 01:40:02,662
Let go!

2191
01:40:02,731 --> 01:40:04,460
All right. Fine.

2192
01:40:05,667 --> 01:40:07,567
Fine.

2193
01:41:05,460 --> 01:41:08,793
Narrator: I'd never been
in a car accident.

2194
01:41:08,863 --> 01:41:11,798
This must have been what
all those people felt like

2195
01:41:11,866 --> 01:41:15,802
before I filed them
as statistics in my reports.

2196
01:41:15,870 --> 01:41:17,167
Goddamn.

2197
01:41:17,238 --> 01:41:18,671
Huh?

2198
01:41:18,740 --> 01:41:20,731
Ha ha ha ha ha hahh!

2199
01:41:20,809 --> 01:41:23,505
We just had
a near-life experience.

2200
01:41:28,817 --> 01:41:31,251
In the world I see,

2201
01:41:31,319 --> 01:41:34,083
you're stalking elk through
the damp canyon forest,

2202
01:41:34,155 --> 01:41:36,680
around the ruins
of  Rockefeller Center.

2203
01:41:38,893 --> 01:41:40,758
You'll wear leather clothes

2204
01:41:40,829 --> 01:41:43,764
that will last you
the rest of your life.

2205
01:41:43,832 --> 01:41:47,268
You'll climb the vines
that wrap the Sears Tower.

2206
01:41:48,736 --> 01:41:50,670
And when you look down,

2207
01:41:50,738 --> 01:41:53,673
you'll see tiny figures
pounding corn,

2208
01:41:53,741 --> 01:41:57,177
Laying strips of venison
on the empty carpool lane

2209
01:41:57,245 --> 01:41:59,179
of some abandoned
superhighway.

2210
01:42:12,093 --> 01:42:13,560
Feel better, champ.

2211
01:42:19,834 --> 01:42:21,461
[Door Closes]

2212
01:42:31,713 --> 01:42:33,738
Narrator: And then...

2213
01:42:33,815 --> 01:42:35,248
Tyler?

2214
01:42:35,316 --> 01:42:36,840
Tyler was gone.

2215
01:42:44,659 --> 01:42:46,889
Was I asleep?

2216
01:42:48,563 --> 01:42:49,860
Had I slept?

2217
01:42:49,931 --> 01:42:51,364
You are not
a beautiful

2218
01:42:51,432 --> 01:42:52,865
unique snowflake,
do you understand me?

2219
01:42:52,934 --> 01:42:55,869
Narrator: The house had become
a living thing,

2220
01:42:55,937 --> 01:42:58,371
wet inside
from so many people

2221
01:42:58,439 --> 01:42:59,770
sweating and breathing.

2222
01:42:59,841 --> 01:43:01,775
We are all from
the same compost.

2223
01:43:01,843 --> 01:43:04,038
So many people moving,
the house moved.

2224
01:43:06,347 --> 01:43:07,780
Planet Tyler.

2225
01:43:07,849 --> 01:43:09,783
I had to hug the walls.

2226
01:43:09,851 --> 01:43:13,412
Trapped inside this
clock work of space monkeys.

2227
01:43:13,488 --> 01:43:14,921
You can't be
smoking in here.

2228
01:43:14,989 --> 01:43:17,719
do you know how much ether
we have in this fucking house?

2229
01:43:17,792 --> 01:43:20,124
Cooking, working,
and sleeping in teams.

2230
01:43:22,697 --> 01:43:24,426
Hang on a second.

2231
01:43:43,351 --> 01:43:46,013
It's under control, sir.

2232
01:43:48,523 --> 01:43:50,388
Where is Tyler?

2233
01:43:50,458 --> 01:43:53,450
Sir, the first rule of 
Project Mayhem is you do not--

2234
01:43:53,528 --> 01:43:55,462
Right, uh...OK.

2235
01:43:57,899 --> 01:44:00,265
I'm all alone.

2236
01:44:00,335 --> 01:44:02,269
My father dumped me.

2237
01:44:02,337 --> 01:44:03,770
Tyler dumped me.

2238
01:44:03,838 --> 01:44:07,035
I am Jacks broken heart.

2239
01:44:10,311 --> 01:44:13,246
What comes next
in Project Mayhem,

2240
01:44:13,314 --> 01:44:14,781
only Tyler knows.

2241
01:44:14,849 --> 01:44:18,307
The second rule is
you do not ask questions.

2242
01:44:20,788 --> 01:44:22,221
Get the fuck
away from me.

2243
01:44:22,290 --> 01:44:23,780
Get the fuck
away from me!

2244
01:44:23,858 --> 01:44:26,258
Who are all these people?

2245
01:44:31,532 --> 01:44:33,659
Paper Street Soap Company.

2246
01:44:35,903 --> 01:44:37,962
Can I come in?

2247
01:44:41,009 --> 01:44:42,670
He's not here.

2248
01:44:42,744 --> 01:44:44,905
What?

2249
01:44:46,180 --> 01:44:49,581
Tyler isn't here.

2250
01:44:49,650 --> 01:44:52,118
Tyler went away.

2251
01:44:52,186 --> 01:44:53,483
Tyler's gone.

2252
01:45:11,272 --> 01:45:12,967
[Shouting]

2253
01:45:24,152 --> 01:45:25,244
Lay him down!

2254
01:45:25,319 --> 01:45:26,650
Gunshot wounds
comin' through!

2255
01:45:26,721 --> 01:45:29,102
Clear some fucking room!

2256
01:45:29,236 --> 01:45:31,500
What happened?!
What happened?!

2257
01:45:31,571 --> 01:45:33,129
We were on assignment.
We were supposed to kill

2258
01:45:33,206 --> 01:45:35,674
2 birds with one stone.

2259
01:45:35,742 --> 01:45:37,835
Destroy a piece
of corporate art...

2260
01:45:37,911 --> 01:45:40,471
Operation Latte Thunder,
go.

2261
01:45:42,382 --> 01:45:44,247
and trash a franchise
coffee bar.

2262
01:45:50,724 --> 01:45:52,021
We had it all
worked out, sir.

2263
01:46:01,234 --> 01:46:02,223
It went smooth
until...

2264
01:46:02,302 --> 01:46:04,532
Police! Freeze!

2265
01:46:04,604 --> 01:46:06,196
Until what?

2266
01:46:06,273 --> 01:46:07,297
They shot Bob.

2267
01:46:08,875 --> 01:46:10,172
They shot him
in the head.

2268
01:46:10,243 --> 01:46:11,232
Those fuckin' pigs!

2269
01:46:14,748 --> 01:46:15,680
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

2270
01:46:15,749 --> 01:46:17,740
- Oh, God.
- Son of a--

2271
01:46:18,818 --> 01:46:20,911
Those motherfuckers!

2272
01:46:20,987 --> 01:46:22,750
You morons.

2273
01:46:22,822 --> 01:46:25,086
You're running around
in ski masks,

2274
01:46:25,158 --> 01:46:26,284
trying
to blow things up.

2275
01:46:26,359 --> 01:46:27,621
What did you think
was gonna happen?!

2276
01:46:31,698 --> 01:46:32,665
OK, quick,

2277
01:46:32,732 --> 01:46:34,097
we gotta get rid
of the evidence.

2278
01:46:34,167 --> 01:46:35,099
We gotta get rid
of this body!

2279
01:46:35,168 --> 01:46:36,157
Bury him.

2280
01:46:36,236 --> 01:46:37,669
What?

2281
01:46:37,737 --> 01:46:38,669
Take him
to the garden

2282
01:46:38,738 --> 01:46:39,864
and bury him.

2283
01:46:40,974 --> 01:46:41,906
Come on,
people!

2284
01:46:41,975 --> 01:46:42,907
Let's go!

2285
01:46:42,976 --> 01:46:44,136
Hey, get
the fuck of f!.

2286
01:46:44,211 --> 01:46:45,143
Get away from him!

2287
01:46:45,212 --> 01:46:46,770
What are you
talking about?

2288
01:46:46,846 --> 01:46:48,177
This isn't a fucking
piece of evidence,

2289
01:46:48,248 --> 01:46:49,510
this is a person!

2290
01:46:49,583 --> 01:46:50,515
He's a friend
of mine,

2291
01:46:50,584 --> 01:46:51,676
and you're not
gonna bury him

2292
01:46:51,751 --> 01:46:52,740
in the fucking garden.

2293
01:46:52,819 --> 01:46:55,811
He was killed serving
Project Mayhem, sir.

2294
01:46:55,889 --> 01:46:57,015
This is Bob.

2295
01:46:57,090 --> 01:46:59,524
But sir, in--in
Project Mayhem

2296
01:46:59,593 --> 01:47:01,151
we have no names.

2297
01:47:01,228 --> 01:47:02,195
No, you
listen to me.

2298
01:47:02,262 --> 01:47:04,127
This is a man,
and he has a name.

2299
01:47:04,197 --> 01:47:06,825
And it's
Robert Paulson, OK?

2300
01:47:06,900 --> 01:47:08,265
Robert
Paulson?

2301
01:47:08,335 --> 01:47:09,927
He's a man
and he's dead now

2302
01:47:10,003 --> 01:47:11,027
because of us,
all right?

2303
01:47:11,104 --> 01:47:12,298
do you understand that?

2304
01:47:12,372 --> 01:47:14,602
I understand.

2305
01:47:17,177 --> 01:47:18,474
In death,

2306
01:47:18,545 --> 01:47:20,308
a member of 
Project Mayhem

2307
01:47:20,380 --> 01:47:22,007
has a name.

2308
01:47:23,250 --> 01:47:25,445
His name is
Robert Paulson.

2309
01:47:26,519 --> 01:47:28,350
His name is

2310
01:47:28,421 --> 01:47:32,517
His name is

2311
01:47:32,592 --> 01:47:35,618
His name is
Robert Paulson.

2312
01:47:35,695 --> 01:47:37,026
Come on, guys,
please, stop it.

2313
01:47:37,097 --> 01:47:38,564
His name is
Robert Paulson.

2314
01:47:38,632 --> 01:47:41,260
[Chanting] His name
is Robert Paulson.

2315
01:47:41,334 --> 01:47:43,359
Shut up!

2316
01:47:43,436 --> 01:47:44,425
This is all
over with!

2317
01:47:44,504 --> 01:47:46,267
[Chanting] His name
is Robert Paulson.

2318
01:47:46,339 --> 01:47:48,466
His name is
Robert Paulson.

2319
01:47:48,541 --> 01:47:51,101
His name is

01:54:22,890 --> 01:54:24,414
Marla--You're
fucking Marla, Tyler.

2498
01:54:24,492 --> 01:54:26,460
Uh, technically,
you're fucking Marla.

2499
01:54:26,527 --> 01:54:27,824
But it's
all the same to her.

2500
01:54:30,164 --> 01:54:31,654
Oh, my God.

2501
01:54:32,734 --> 01:54:34,725
Now you see
our dilemma.

2502
01:54:34,802 --> 01:54:36,827
She knows too much.

2503
01:54:37,972 --> 01:54:39,030
I think we're going
to have to talk

2504
01:54:39,107 --> 01:54:42,304
about how this might
compromise our goals.

2505
01:54:42,377 --> 01:54:45,403
Wh--What are
you saying?

2506
01:54:45,480 --> 01:54:47,141
This is--
This is bullshit.

2507
01:54:47,215 --> 01:54:48,705
This is bullshit.

2508
01:54:48,783 --> 01:54:49,750
I'm not listening
to this.

2509
01:54:49,817 --> 01:54:50,749
You are insane.

2510
01:54:50,818 --> 01:54:52,649
No, you're insane.

2511
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:55,245
And we simply do not
have time for this crap.

2512
01:54:57,825 --> 01:54:59,690
It's called
a changeover.

2513
01:54:59,761 --> 01:55:01,285
The movie goes on,

2514
01:55:01,362 --> 01:55:02,795
and nobody
in the audience

2515
01:55:02,864 --> 01:55:04,422
has any idea.

2516
01:55:17,412 --> 01:55:18,344
Woman: Sir!

2517
01:55:18,413 --> 01:55:19,744
Are you checking out?

2518
01:55:19,814 --> 01:55:21,008
Yeah, uh,
b-bill me.

2519
01:55:21,082 --> 01:55:22,743
I need you to
initial this list

2520
01:55:22,817 --> 01:55:23,909
of phone calls,
please.

2521
01:55:27,922 --> 01:55:29,082
When were
these made?

2522
01:55:29,157 --> 01:55:30,351
It says
right there, sir,

2523
01:55:30,425 --> 01:55:31,983
between 2:00 and 3:30
this morning.

2524
01:55:32,060 --> 01:55:33,391
No, I w--

2525
01:55:37,298 --> 01:55:38,356
Have I been
going to bed

2526
01:55:38,433 --> 01:55:39,695
earlier
every night?

2527
01:55:39,767 --> 01:55:41,792
Have I been
sleeping later?

2528
01:55:43,771 --> 01:55:46,797
Have I been Tyler
longer and longer?

2529
01:55:50,344 --> 01:55:51,276
Is anybody here?

2530
01:55:54,348 --> 01:55:57,181
Dj vu
all over again.

2531
01:55:58,252 --> 01:55:59,184
Yeah, with
enough soap,

2532
01:55:59,253 --> 01:56:00,652
we could blow up
just about anything.

2533
01:56:03,825 --> 01:56:05,850
Oh, my God.

2534
01:56:08,963 --> 01:56:09,930
Man On Telephone:
1 888.

2535
01:56:09,997 --> 01:56:11,259
I'm sorry,
who am I calling?

2536
01:56:11,332 --> 01:56:13,300
1 888 Franklin.
This is Maintenance.

2537
01:56:15,403 --> 01:56:16,836
Hello?

2538
01:56:16,904 --> 01:56:17,836
Hello?

2539
01:56:17,905 --> 01:56:19,770
1 888 Franklin Street?

2540
01:56:19,841 --> 01:56:22,935
Yes.
Can I help you?

2541
01:56:25,246 --> 01:56:26,873
Hello?

2542
01:56:26,948 --> 01:56:28,074
Yeah, yeah.

2543
01:56:28,149 --> 01:56:29,411
Uh, I need to talk
to your supervisor

2544
01:56:29,484 --> 01:56:30,416
right away.

2545
01:56:30,485 --> 01:56:31,417
Speaking.

2546
01:56:31,486 --> 01:56:32,418
OK, listen to me.

2547
01:56:32,487 --> 01:56:33,681
I think something
really terrible

2548
01:56:33,754 --> 01:56:34,721
is about to happen
at your building.

2549
01:56:34,789 --> 01:56:35,778
You have got--

2550
01:56:35,857 --> 01:56:37,085
It's under
control, sir.

2551
01:56:38,459 --> 01:56:39,426
Excuse me?

2552
01:56:39,494 --> 01:56:41,052
Don't worry
about us, sir.

2553
01:56:41,129 --> 01:56:42,528
We're solid.

2554
01:56:46,167 --> 01:56:47,464
Man On Telephone:
21 60.

2555
01:56:55,409 --> 01:56:56,433
Marla!
Marla!

2556
01:56:56,511 --> 01:56:58,502
Hey--Fuck!--Wait!

2557
01:56:59,580 --> 01:57:01,275
Wait, I gotta
talk to you!

2558
01:57:01,349 --> 01:57:02,509
Marla, Marla!

2559
01:57:02,583 --> 01:57:03,675
Your whacked-out
bald freaks

2560
01:57:03,751 --> 01:57:05,218
hit me with
a fucking broom!

2561
01:57:05,286 --> 01:57:06,947
They almost
broke my arm!

2562
01:57:07,021 --> 01:57:08,648
They were burning their
fingertips with lye,

2563
01:57:08,723 --> 01:57:09,712
the stink was
unbelievable.

2564
01:57:09,790 --> 01:57:10,722
Look--Look,
listen,

2565
01:57:10,791 --> 01:57:11,723
it's gonna take
a tremendous act

2566
01:57:11,792 --> 01:57:12,724
of faith
on your part,

2567
01:57:12,793 --> 01:57:13,760
but you've got
to hear me out.

2568
01:57:13,828 --> 01:57:15,728
Oh, here comes
an avalanche of bullshit.

2569
01:57:15,796 --> 01:57:17,263
A little more faith
than that.

2570
01:57:21,636 --> 01:57:22,568
No, listen,
I don't want to hear

2571
01:57:22,637 --> 01:57:23,569
anything
you have to say.

2572
01:57:23,638 --> 01:57:25,697
You have every
right to be...

2573
01:57:25,773 --> 01:57:27,832
Um, I'll just have
a coffee, thanks.

2574
01:57:27,909 --> 01:57:30,844
Sir, anything you order
is free of charge, sir.

2575
01:57:30,912 --> 01:57:32,971
Why is it
free of charge?

2576
01:57:33,047 --> 01:57:34,139
Don't--Don't ask.

2577
01:57:34,215 --> 01:57:35,273
Whatever.

2578
01:57:35,349 --> 01:57:37,977
I'll have the clam chowder,
the fried chicken

2579
01:57:38,052 --> 01:57:39,144
with the baked potato
with everything,

2580
01:57:39,220 --> 01:57:40,687
and a chocolate
chiffon pie.

2581
01:57:40,755 --> 01:57:42,848
Clean food, please.

2582
01:57:42,924 --> 01:57:44,687
In that case, sir,
may I advise against

2583
01:57:44,759 --> 01:57:45,987
the lady eating
the clam chowder?

2584
01:57:46,060 --> 01:57:48,051
No clam chowder,
thank you.

2585
01:57:50,264 --> 01:57:51,788
You've got
about 30 seconds.

2586
01:57:54,535 --> 01:57:55,467
Marla, I know that
I've been acting

2587
01:57:55,536 --> 01:57:56,730
very, very strange.

2588
01:57:56,804 --> 01:57:58,965
OK, I know that
it's got to seem

2589
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:00,098
Like there's
2 sides to me--

2590
01:58:00,174 --> 01:58:01,106
2 sides?

2591
01:58:01,175 --> 01:58:02,472
You're Dr.Jekyll
and Mr.Jackass.

2592
01:58:02,543 --> 01:58:03,475
I deserve that,
but--

2593
01:58:03,544 --> 01:58:04,704
I've come
to realize something

2594
01:58:04,779 --> 01:58:05,711
very, very
important.

2595
01:58:05,780 --> 01:58:06,838
What?

2596
01:58:06,914 --> 01:58:08,347
The full extent
of our relationship

2597
01:58:08,416 --> 01:58:10,475
wasn't really clear
to me up until now,

2598
01:58:10,551 --> 01:58:11,745
for reasons I'm not
going to go into,

2599
01:58:11,819 --> 01:58:13,252
but the important
thing is, I know

2600
01:58:13,321 --> 01:58:14,515
that I haven't been
treating you so nice.

2601
01:58:14,589 --> 01:58:15,521
Yeah, whatever.

2602
01:58:15,590 --> 01:58:16,557
No, no--
1 5 seconds.

2603
01:58:16,624 --> 01:58:17,818
1 5 seconds,
please, please.

2604
01:58:17,892 --> 01:58:19,723
1 5 seconds, don't
open your mouth.

2605
01:58:19,794 --> 01:58:22,354
I'm trying to tell you
that I'm sorry.

2606
01:58:22,430 --> 01:58:23,624
Because what
I've come to realize

2607
01:58:23,698 --> 01:58:26,462
is that I really
like you, Marla.

2608
01:58:27,668 --> 01:58:28,965
You do?

2609
01:58:29,036 --> 01:58:30,560
I really do.

2610
01:58:30,638 --> 01:58:31,605
I care about you

2611
01:58:31,672 --> 01:58:32,696
and I don't want
anything bad

2612
01:58:32,773 --> 01:58:35,333
to happen to you
because of me.

2613
01:58:35,409 --> 01:58:38,105
Marla, your life
is in danger.

2614
01:58:39,247 --> 01:58:40,179
What?

2615
01:58:40,248 --> 01:58:42,648
You need to leave
town for a while.

2616
01:58:42,717 --> 01:58:43,979
Get out of 
any major city

2617
01:58:44,051 --> 01:58:45,177
and just go camping
or something.

2618
01:58:45,253 --> 01:58:46,311
You're an insane person.

2619
01:58:46,387 --> 01:58:47,479
No, no,
I've involved you

2620
01:58:47,555 --> 01:58:49,352
in something terrible
that's about to happen.

2621
01:58:49,423 --> 01:58:50,856
No.
Shut up,

2622
01:58:50,925 --> 01:58:52,085
shut up!

2623
01:58:55,296 --> 01:58:57,025
Listen,
I tried, Tyler.

2624
01:58:57,098 --> 01:58:58,258
I really tried.

2625
01:58:58,332 --> 01:58:59,264
I know you did.

2626
01:58:59,333 --> 01:59:01,301
There are things
about you I like.

2627
01:59:01,369 --> 01:59:02,859
You're smart,
you're funny,

2628
01:59:02,937 --> 01:59:05,303
you're spectacular
in bed.

2629
01:59:05,373 --> 01:59:08,536
But you're
intolerable.

2630
01:59:08,609 --> 01:59:11,510
You have very serious
emotional problems.

2631
01:59:11,579 --> 01:59:13,342
Deep-seated problems
for which you should seek

2632
01:59:13,414 --> 01:59:14,745
professional help.

2633
01:59:14,815 --> 01:59:16,214
I know,
and I'm sorry.

2634
01:59:16,284 --> 01:59:17,148
Yeah, you're sorry,
I'm sorry,

2635
01:59:17,218 --> 01:59:18,344
everyone's sorry.
But...

2636
01:59:19,887 --> 01:59:21,582
I can't
do this anymore.

2637
01:59:22,690 --> 01:59:24,214
I can't.

2638
01:59:24,292 --> 01:59:25,281
And I won't.

2639
01:59:26,861 --> 01:59:27,885
I'm gone.

2640
01:59:29,597 --> 01:59:30,529
You can't leave,
Marla,

2641
01:59:30,598 --> 01:59:32,267
you're not safe!

2642
01:59:36,171 --> 01:59:37,103
No!
Leave me alone!

2643
01:59:37,172 --> 01:59:39,037
Marla, I'm trying
to protect you.

2644
01:59:39,107 --> 01:59:40,631
I don't ever want
to see you again!

2645
01:59:40,709 --> 01:59:42,370
That's fine, if
that's what it takes...

2646
01:59:42,444 --> 01:59:43,775
You wait.
Wait right here.

2647
01:59:44,980 --> 01:59:46,675
[Brakes Squealing]

2648
01:59:48,450 --> 01:59:49,382
Hold it
right there.

2649
01:59:49,451 --> 01:59:50,383
- [Honking]
- Shut up!

2650
01:59:50,452 --> 01:59:51,476
Shut up!

2651
01:59:51,553 --> 01:59:53,384
Take this money
and get on this bus.

2652
01:59:53,455 --> 01:59:54,387
And I promise you

2653
01:59:54,456 --> 01:59:55,445
I will never
bother you again

2654
01:59:55,524 --> 01:59:56,456
if that's
what you want.

2655
01:59:56,525 --> 01:59:57,753
- [Honks]
- Shut up!

2656
01:59:57,826 --> 01:59:59,157
Please get
on the bus.

2657
01:59:59,227 --> 02:00:00,626
Please get
on the bus!

2658
02:00:02,397 --> 02:00:03,557
Why are you
doing this?

2659
02:00:03,632 --> 02:00:05,224
Because they think you're
some kind of a threat.

2660
02:00:05,300 --> 02:00:06,392
I--I can't explain it
right now,

2661
02:00:06,468 --> 02:00:07,400
just trust me.

2662
02:00:07,469 --> 02:00:08,401
If I see
where you're going,

2663
02:00:08,470 --> 02:00:09,402
you will
not be safe.

2664
02:00:09,471 --> 02:00:10,665
I'm not paying
this back.

2665
02:00:10,739 --> 02:00:12,206
I consider it
asshole tax.

2666
02:00:12,274 --> 02:00:14,367
That's fine. Remember,
stay out of major cities

2667
02:00:14,443 --> 02:00:15,569
for at least
a couple of days, OK?

2668
02:00:15,644 --> 02:00:16,576
Tyler.

2669
02:00:18,180 --> 02:00:19,511
You're
the worst thing

2670
02:00:19,581 --> 02:00:20,980
that ever
happened to me.

2671
02:00:28,523 --> 02:00:29,455
[Honking]

2672
02:00:36,064 --> 02:00:37,429
Hello.

2673
02:00:37,499 --> 02:00:39,091
I need you
to arrest me.

2674
02:00:39,167 --> 02:00:41,465
I am the leader of 
a terrorist organization

2675
02:00:41,536 --> 02:00:43,834
responsible for numerous
acts of vandalism,

2676
02:00:43,905 --> 02:00:45,600
and assault
all over this city.

2677
02:00:46,675 --> 02:00:47,903
...in the
metropolitan area,

2678
02:00:47,976 --> 02:00:50,501
with probably a couple
hundred members.

2679
02:00:50,579 --> 02:00:51,671
Chapters
have sprung up

2680
02:00:51,747 --> 02:00:54,511
in 5 or 6 other
major cities already.

2681
02:00:54,583 --> 02:00:57,643
This is a tightly
regimented organization,

2682
02:00:57,719 --> 02:00:59,812
with many cells
capable of operating

2683
02:00:59,888 --> 02:01:02,914
completely independent
of central leadership.

2684
02:01:02,991 --> 02:01:05,118
Look, look,
go to that house, OK?

2685
02:01:05,193 --> 02:01:07,320
1 537 Paper Street.

2686
02:01:07,396 --> 02:01:09,330
That's our headquarters.

2687
02:01:09,398 --> 02:01:11,923
In the back,
buried in the garden,

2688
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:15,094
you'll find the body
of  Robert Paulson.

2689
02:01:15,170 --> 02:01:17,104
In the basement,

2690
02:01:17,172 --> 02:01:18,366
you're gonna find
some bathtubs

2691
02:01:18,440 --> 02:01:19,964
that have been used
very recently

2692
02:01:20,041 --> 02:01:24,068
to make large quantities
of nitroglycerin.

2693
02:01:24,146 --> 02:01:25,204
I believe the plan

2694
02:01:25,280 --> 02:01:27,043
is to blow up
the headquarters

2695
02:01:27,115 --> 02:01:28,707
of these credit card
companies,

2696
02:01:28,784 --> 02:01:30,649
and the T.R.W. building.

2697
02:01:32,387 --> 02:01:33,615
Why these buildings?

2698
02:01:33,688 --> 02:01:35,713
Why credit card
companies?

2699
02:01:35,791 --> 02:01:37,622
If you erase
the debt record,

2700
02:01:37,692 --> 02:01:40,183
then we all
go back to zero.

2701
02:01:40,262 --> 02:01:42,287
It'll create
total chaos.

2702
02:01:45,066 --> 02:01:46,055
Keep him talking.

2703
02:01:46,134 --> 02:01:47,123
I need to make
a phone call.

2704
02:01:58,013 --> 02:01:59,947
I really admire
what you're doing.

2705
02:02:01,616 --> 02:02:02,548
What?

2706
02:02:02,617 --> 02:02:04,812
You're a brave man
to order this.

2707
02:02:04,886 --> 02:02:06,547
You're a genius,
sir.

2708
02:02:06,621 --> 02:02:09,556
You said, if anyone
ever interferes

2709
02:02:09,624 --> 02:02:11,387
with Project Mayhem--
even you--

2710
02:02:11,460 --> 02:02:13,758
we gotta
get his bails.

2711
02:02:15,230 --> 02:02:16,197
It's useless
to fight.

2712
02:02:16,264 --> 02:02:17,390
This is really
a powerful gesture,

2713
02:02:17,466 --> 02:02:18,398
Mr. Durden.

2714
02:02:18,467 --> 02:02:19,729
It'll set quite
an example.

2715
02:02:19,801 --> 02:02:21,894
You're making
a big mistake, fellas.

2716
02:02:21,970 --> 02:02:22,902
You said
you'd say that.

2717
02:02:22,971 --> 02:02:24,438
I'm not
Tyler Durden!

2718
02:02:24,506 --> 02:02:26,030
You told us
you'd say that, too.

2719
02:02:26,107 --> 02:02:28,940
All right,
I am Tyler Durden.

2720
02:02:29,010 --> 02:02:30,204
Listen to me,

2721
02:02:30,278 --> 02:02:31,836
I'm giving you
a direct order.

2722
02:02:31,913 --> 02:02:33,904
We are aborting this
mission, right now.

2723
02:02:33,982 --> 02:02:35,381
You said you would
definitely say that.

2724
02:02:41,590 --> 02:02:42,614
Are you fucking
out of your minds?

2725
02:02:42,691 --> 02:02:43,988
You're
police officers!

2726
02:02:46,995 --> 02:02:48,121
Somebody
timing this?

2727
02:02:48,196 --> 02:02:49,128
No! No!

2728
02:02:49,197 --> 02:02:50,721
Keep your
mouth shut!

2729

[Knock On Door]

2730
02:02:51,800 --> 02:02:52,732
Shit.

2731
02:02:55,504 --> 02:02:56,471
Yeah?

2732
02:02:56,538 --> 02:02:57,562
Hey, you know, some
of this information

2733
02:02:57,639 --> 02:02:58,901
checks out.

2734
02:02:58,974 --> 02:03:00,532
Let's go over
to that house

2735
02:03:00,609 --> 02:03:01,667
on Paper Street.

2736
02:03:01,743 --> 02:03:02,801
Be right there.

2738
02:03:03,879 --> 02:03:05,244
Hey! Wait!

2739
02:03:05,313 --> 02:03:06,541
I got him.

2740
02:03:06,615 --> 02:03:07,877
Sir, we have
to do this, sir.

2741
02:03:07,949 --> 02:03:09,075
Stop fighting.

2742
02:03:09,150 --> 02:03:10,447
Where's the rubber band?

2743
02:03:10,519 --> 02:03:11,611
Get away from me!

2744
02:03:11,686 --> 02:03:12,618
Drop that
fucking knife!

2745
02:03:12,687 --> 02:03:13,619
Drop it!

2746
02:03:16,858 --> 02:03:17,790
Back up.

Face down
on the floor,

2748
02:03:18,994 --> 02:03:19,926
both of you,
right now!

2749
02:03:22,497 --> 02:03:24,089
Get down
on the floor!

[Horns Blaring]

2753
02:03:57,933 --> 02:03:59,833
Get away!
Get away!

2754
02:04:12,547 --> 02:04:14,014
I ran.

2755
02:04:15,550 --> 02:04:17,279
I ran until
my muscles burned

2756
02:04:17,352 --> 02:04:19,479
and my veins pumped
battery acid.

2757
02:04:22,257 --> 02:04:23,918
Then I ran
some more.

2758
02:05:05,533 --> 02:05:07,364
What the fuck
are you doing?

2759
02:05:07,435 --> 02:05:09,027

in your underpants.

2760

Man, you look
like a crazy person.

No, I'm
onto you.

2762
02:05:12,273 --> 02:05:13,399
I know what's
going on here.

2763
02:05:13,475 --> 02:05:14,533
Well come on,
then.

2764
02:05:14,609 --> 02:05:16,099
I got us a great place
to watch from.

Oh, Christ.

Now what
are you doing?

Why? Greatest thing
you've ever done, man.

No, I can't
let this happen.

God damn it, since when
is Project Mayhem

are empty.

even there.

Wouldn't do that.

Not unless I knew which
wires were what.

then I know.

the whole day

not the green one.
