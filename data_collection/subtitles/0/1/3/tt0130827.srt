1
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:22,683
"We shall not cease from exploration...

2
00:00:22,763 --> 00:00:25,718
and the end of all our exploring
will be to arrive where we started...

3
00:00:25,799 --> 00:00:28,594
and know the place for the first time."
- T.S. Eliot, "Little Gidding"

4
00:00:28,676 --> 00:00:34,587
"After the game is before the game."
- S. Herberger

5
00:01:52,007 --> 00:01:54,243
Man...

6
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:58,476
probably the most mysterious species
on our planet.

7
00:01:58,558 --> 00:02:01,673
A mystery of unanswered questions.

8
00:02:01,753 --> 00:02:05,587
Who are we?
Where do we come from?

9
00:02:05,669 --> 00:02:11,061
Where are we going?
How do we know what we think we know?

10
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,734
Why do we believe anything at all?

11
00:02:15,815 --> 00:02:19,729
Countless questions
in search of an answer...

12
00:02:19,809 --> 00:02:24,802
an answer that will give rise
to a new question...

13
00:02:24,883 --> 00:02:30,634
and the next answer will give rise
to the next question and so on.

14
00:02:32,113 --> 00:02:36,906
But, in the end,
isn't it always the same question?

15
00:02:36,987 --> 00:02:41,420
And always the same answer?

16
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:48,890
The ball is round. The game lasts
90 minutes. That's a fact.

17
00:02:48,931 --> 00:02:51,327
Everything else is pure theory.

18
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:57,120
Here we go!

19
00:04:48,704 --> 00:04:50,672
- Manni?
- Lola.

20
00:04:50,739 --> 00:04:53,037
What's up? Where are you?

21
00:04:53,108 --> 00:04:55,838
Where were you, damn it?

22
00:04:55,911 --> 00:05:00,712
- I got there too late.
- But why today? You're always on time!

23
00:05:00,816 --> 00:05:03,944
My moped got ripped off.
It doesn't matter.

24
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:05,509
Yes, it matters!

25
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:07,620
What's wrong?

26
00:05:07,723 --> 00:05:11,682
It wasn't my fault, Manni.
I went to get some cigarettes.

27
00:05:12,928 --> 00:05:15,488
I can't believe how fast
that guy was.

28
00:05:15,564 --> 00:05:19,193
There was nothing I could do.
He was gone before I got outside.

29
00:05:19,268 --> 00:05:20,997
I even took a taxi.

30
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,130
That dumbass drove east.
They got a Grunewald St. there too.

31
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:26,901
When I noticed, it was too late.

32
00:05:26,975 --> 00:05:31,071
It just didn't occur to me. I was
so screwed up because of our moped.

33
00:05:31,146 --> 00:05:33,842
- Doesn't matter.
- And when I got there, you were gone.

34
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,414
It doesn't matter now anyway.
I'm done for.

35
00:05:37,486 --> 00:05:40,387
- But why?
- Help me, Lola!

36
00:05:40,456 --> 00:05:43,755
I don't know what to do.

37
00:05:43,859 --> 00:05:46,327
You weren't there,
and I messed it up.

38
00:05:46,395 --> 00:05:48,795
I blew it. I'm such a jerk!

39
00:05:49,498 --> 00:05:52,592
Just calm down.
Now what happened?

40
00:05:52,668 --> 00:05:56,069
Just tell me what happened, okay?

41
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:59,404
Lola, he's gonna kill me.
I'm gonna die.

42
00:05:59,475 --> 00:06:02,000
Stop it! You're scaring me.
What's up?

43
00:06:02,077 --> 00:06:05,979
- Did you get caught?
- No, but that would've been something.

44
00:06:06,682 --> 00:06:10,982
Everything went really great. We drove
the cars there, and those guys came.

45
00:06:11,086 --> 00:06:14,055
They paid, and that was it.
Easy as pie.

46
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:19,925
I got waved across fhe border,
and then they dropped me off out there.

47
00:06:19,995 --> 00:06:23,692
Then I went to see that cyclops,
and he was finished in no time.

48
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:27,326
And everything was on time,
except for you.

49
00:06:27,403 --> 00:06:29,337
You weren't there.

50
00:06:31,407 --> 00:06:34,638
- Then what?
- Nothing. Not even a phone booth.

51
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,437
I couldn't even call a taxi,
so l walked to the subway station.

52
00:06:38,514 --> 00:06:41,915
On the train, there was this bum...

53
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,646
who somehow fell down,
and suddenly these inspectors showed up.

54
00:06:45,521 --> 00:06:48,149
And I got out like always--
an old reflex.

55
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:02,466
- The bag!
- The bag.

56
00:07:35,771 --> 00:07:37,329
The bag!

57
00:07:38,073 --> 00:07:41,770
I'm such a fucking amateur!
A dumbass!

58
00:07:41,877 --> 00:07:46,678
This could only happen to me! If you'd
picked me up, it wouldn't have happened.

59
00:07:46,715 --> 00:07:49,582
I was so out of it.
You're always on time otherwise!

60
00:07:49,685 --> 00:07:52,586
- Didn't you call the next station?
- Sure.

61
00:07:52,621 --> 00:07:56,079
But it was too late.
The fucking bag was already gone.

62
00:07:56,124 --> 00:07:58,786
And I know who has it. That bum!
That plastic bag freak!

63
00:07:58,894 --> 00:08:01,658
He's on a plane to Florida
or Hawaii...

64
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:05,791
or Canada or Hong Kong
or Bermuda or whatever.

65
00:08:09,404 --> 00:08:11,804
- What about Ronnie?
- He'll kill me.

66
00:08:11,907 --> 00:08:14,068
- You gotta tell him.
- Forget it!

67
00:08:14,142 --> 00:08:16,440
- Why?
- He won't believe a single word.

68
00:08:16,512 --> 00:08:20,642
I kept a carton of cigarettes once.
He noticed right away.

69
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,816
He doesn't believe anybody.

70
00:08:23,852 --> 00:08:26,980
The jobs with those mercs
was a kind of test...

71
00:08:28,056 --> 00:08:30,524
to see if he could trust me.

72
00:08:32,427 --> 00:08:34,861
How much was there,
in the bag?

73
00:08:35,564 --> 00:08:38,192
- 100,000.
- What?

74
00:08:39,334 --> 00:08:43,236
- 100,000. A test.
- Oh, shit!

75
00:08:43,338 --> 00:08:46,102
See! I knew you wouldn't come up
with any idea.

76
00:08:46,174 --> 00:08:49,473
I always said someday
you wouldn't know what to do.

77
00:08:49,545 --> 00:08:51,479
Not when you die, sooner!

78
00:08:51,547 --> 00:08:54,209
You said, "Love can do everything."

79
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:57,480
- So find 100,000 marks in 20 minutes.
- 20 minutes?

80
00:08:57,553 --> 00:09:01,489
At 12:00 by the water tower
around the corner, Ronnie said.

81
00:09:01,557 --> 00:09:04,048
- In 20 minutes.
- Run away, Manni!

82
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:05,421
- No.
- Why not?

83
00:09:06,862 --> 00:09:09,888
- Nobody escapes Ronnie.
- I'll go with you.

84
00:09:09,965 --> 00:09:12,957
When Ronnie gets here in 20 minutes,
I'll be a goner.

85
00:09:13,068 --> 00:09:14,865
Stop it, Manni!

86
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,734
What for? You can't get me
100 grand either!

87
00:09:17,806 --> 00:09:22,175
He'll rub me out, and all that's
left of me will be 100,000 ashes...

88
00:09:22,277 --> 00:09:25,610
floating down the Spree to the North Sea
and no more Manni!

89
00:09:25,681 --> 00:09:28,946
- You can't do a thing!
- Shut up!

90
00:09:38,594 --> 00:09:39,822
Listen.

91
00:09:39,895 --> 00:09:44,594
Wait for me. I'll help you.
Stay put. I'll be there in 20 minutes.

92
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,964
- Okay?
- Gonna pawn all your jewelry?

93
00:09:47,035 --> 00:09:49,094
Where are you?

94
00:09:49,204 --> 00:09:53,140
In a phone booth, downtown,
in front of the Spirale Bar.

95
00:09:53,842 --> 00:09:56,675
Okay, stay where you are.
I promise I'll come up with something.

96
00:09:56,745 --> 00:09:58,440
In 20 minutes, okay?

97
00:10:00,415 --> 00:10:03,043
What the hell. I'll go over to the Bolle
and get that 100 grand.

98
00:10:03,118 --> 00:10:04,813
Cut it out!

99
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,515
Ronnie said they make 200 grand a day,
so they must have 100 grand by noon.

100
00:10:08,624 --> 00:10:12,526
You're nuts! Don't do a thing! Just
stay in the damned booth! I'm coming.

101
00:10:12,628 --> 00:10:15,529
- That's it. I'll rob the store.
- Are you cracked?

102
00:10:15,631 --> 00:10:19,863
-Don't do a thing! Stay put! I'm coming.
-Then what?

103
00:10:19,935 --> 00:10:21,459
I'll think of something!

104
00:10:21,536 --> 00:10:24,699
In 20 minutes I'll be dead
unless I steal the money!

105
00:10:24,773 --> 00:10:26,741
- No, wait!
- What for?

106
00:10:26,842 --> 00:10:29,606
I'll get the money somehow.

107
00:10:32,748 --> 00:10:34,807
I'm going in there at 12:00,
if you aren't here.

108
00:11:01,977 --> 00:11:04,138
Okay! Who? Who?

109
00:11:42,181 --> 00:11:43,459
Dad!

110
00:11:51,414 --> 00:11:54,491
Lola, are you going shopping?
I need shampoo.

111
00:11:57,051 --> 00:12:00,288
Of course, I knew that Sagittarius
was your ascendant.

112
00:12:00,368 --> 00:12:04,668
Sure, the more I think about it,
I don't know.

113
00:12:06,606 --> 00:12:09,402
Yeah, but you're married too.

114
00:13:03,927 --> 00:13:07,084
Hey! Get your eyes open!

115
00:13:10,205 --> 00:13:11,934
You bitch.

116
00:13:12,007 --> 00:13:12,996
"And Then"

117
00:14:17,472 --> 00:14:20,373
It's worst at night.

118
00:14:20,475 --> 00:14:23,273
I wake up
and can't fall asleep again.

119
00:14:23,378 --> 00:14:26,176
And then I'm afraid.

120
00:14:26,281 --> 00:14:28,306
Me! Afraid of the dark.

121
00:14:29,384 --> 00:14:32,842
I've never been afraid of the dark.
I've never been afraid before.

122
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,190
But I think about us...

123
00:14:40,395 --> 00:14:43,523
and I just think
it'll keep going on like this.

124
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,063
And you wouldn't dare--

125
00:14:57,212 --> 00:14:59,976
And then I ask myself
what I'm doing here.

126
00:15:00,048 --> 00:15:05,509
How long will this go on?
The secrecy, all this damned lying?

127
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:10,683
Should I grow old, waiting for a man
who won't stand by me?

128
00:15:48,563 --> 00:15:50,463
Hey! You need a bike?

129
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,598
50 marks, as good as new.

130
00:15:55,203 --> 00:15:56,636
No.

131
00:15:59,174 --> 00:16:00,801
"And Then"

132
00:16:47,722 --> 00:16:50,885
Hey, man, l know that!

133
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,553
It's not my fault
it's so much money!

134
00:16:58,533 --> 00:17:01,468
500? What am I supposed to do
with 500 marks?

135
00:17:17,452 --> 00:17:19,044
Thanks.

136
00:17:30,698 --> 00:17:32,097
Your phone card!

137
00:17:52,887 --> 00:17:56,084
I have to go.
Meyer will be here in a minute.

138
00:18:00,595 --> 00:18:02,995
Can we meet later on?

139
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:06,963
- Do you love me?
- What?

140
00:18:07,035 --> 00:18:09,128
Do you love me?

141
00:18:09,204 --> 00:18:11,331
Why are you asking now?

142
00:18:11,406 --> 00:18:13,897
Do you love me?

143
00:18:14,008 --> 00:18:16,135
Yes, I do, damn it!

144
00:18:17,112 --> 00:18:19,205
Then decide.

145
00:18:19,314 --> 00:18:20,747
But not now!

146
00:18:20,815 --> 00:18:23,648
You have to decide sometime.

147
00:18:23,718 --> 00:18:26,551
But why now, here, at once?

148
00:18:32,927 --> 00:18:35,122
Because I'm pregnant.

149
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:49,142
Hey, look at that? Our little princess,
Lola! What a rare pleasure.

150
00:18:51,379 --> 00:18:53,711
- Why the rush?
- Please, let me in.

151
00:18:53,781 --> 00:18:57,979
Little Miss wants to see Big Daddy?
Sure thing.

152
00:19:10,098 --> 00:19:11,793
Sorry.

153
00:19:13,668 --> 00:19:14,965
"And Then"

154
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:26,306
Tell me, do you want
to have a baby with me?

155
00:19:31,085 --> 00:19:32,609
Yes.

156
00:19:36,191 --> 00:19:37,556
Lola?

157
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,217
Dad.

158
00:19:39,294 --> 00:19:41,125
Your daughter?

159
00:19:47,535 --> 00:19:50,265
I'm Jutta Hansen
from the board of directors.

160
00:19:50,338 --> 00:19:52,898
Sorry to interrupt.
It's urgent.

161
00:19:53,007 --> 00:19:55,669
It's okay.
I was just about to--

162
00:19:57,212 --> 00:20:00,204
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

163
00:20:04,719 --> 00:20:06,050
Nothing.

164
00:20:14,729 --> 00:20:19,189
Listen, if I tell you
I need your help...

165
00:20:19,267 --> 00:20:23,931
more than ever in my whole life, and
you're the only one who can help me...

166
00:20:24,038 --> 00:20:25,130
would you help me?

167
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,435
- You look terrible.
- Would you help me?

168
00:20:27,542 --> 00:20:31,034
-What happened?
-I can't explain now. Would you help me?

169
00:20:31,145 --> 00:20:32,976
With what, damn it?

170
00:20:33,748 --> 00:20:36,808
- I need 100,000 marks immediately.
- What?

171
00:20:36,884 --> 00:20:40,911
I need it within the next five minutes,
or else--

172
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,389
- Or else what?
- Something terrible will happen!

173
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:46,784
I don't understand.
What's going on here today?

174
00:20:46,861 --> 00:20:49,762
Please, Dad!
You gotta help me! Please!

175
00:20:49,797 --> 00:20:53,130
- I don't have 100,000 marks.
- What about my life insurance?

176
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:56,170
What about it?
It isn't worth 100,000.

177
00:20:56,271 --> 00:20:59,968
Please, Dad. I'm serious.
This isn't a joke.

178
00:21:00,074 --> 00:21:04,670
-Yes, it is, Lola! You can't be serious!
-If you don't help me, he'll die!

179
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:06,474
- Who'll die?
- Manni.

180
00:21:06,581 --> 00:21:08,048
Who's Manni?

181
00:21:08,116 --> 00:21:10,209
My boyfriend, for over a year!

182
00:21:10,285 --> 00:21:14,187
-I don't even know him. Why will he die?
-It doesn't matter!

183
00:21:21,596 --> 00:21:24,360
Okay, come with me.

184
00:21:33,741 --> 00:21:36,232
- Are you going to help me?
- Of course.

185
00:21:36,311 --> 00:21:38,836
Go home and go to bed.

186
00:21:38,913 --> 00:21:43,873
And tell your mother I won't be home
today or tomorrow or ever again.

187
00:21:43,918 --> 00:21:47,445
I'm leaving you guys
and marrying another woman.

188
00:21:48,523 --> 00:21:53,085
We're going to have kids, and I'll try
to be happy because she wants me.

189
00:21:53,161 --> 00:21:58,599
I'm so sick of hearing, "All you do
is work. You always play the boss."

190
00:21:58,633 --> 00:22:02,660
Maybe so, but so what!
You guys have no idea!

191
00:22:02,737 --> 00:22:06,969
I'm so tired of being the fool,
the one to blame!

192
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:11,535
But Daddy's dough is good enough, huh?
Well, not anymore!

193
00:22:14,682 --> 00:22:18,482
Anyway, I'd never have fathered
a weirdo like you.

194
00:22:18,553 --> 00:22:21,351
- But you did, you jerk!
- No, I didn't!

195
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:27,284
All I'm saying is
you're a cuckoo's egg.

196
00:22:34,602 --> 00:22:36,069
Now you know.

197
00:22:38,072 --> 00:22:41,530
The guy who fathered you
didn't live to see your birth.

198
00:22:43,978 --> 00:22:45,411
Throw her out, please.

199
00:22:47,982 --> 00:22:50,246
Come on!
Get her out of here!

200
00:23:23,117 --> 00:23:25,517
Well, we all have our bad days.

201
00:23:28,623 --> 00:23:30,386
See you around.

202
00:23:43,271 --> 00:23:45,068
My dear...

203
00:23:45,139 --> 00:23:47,164
what's wrong?
whatSwrong?

204
00:23:48,042 --> 00:23:50,237
Do you have the time?

205
00:24:31,886 --> 00:24:33,649
This afternoon?

206
00:24:35,723 --> 00:24:38,191
All right. No, forget it.

207
00:24:38,292 --> 00:24:41,193
It's okay. Yeah.

208
00:26:15,423 --> 00:26:17,015
Wait!

209
00:26:18,092 --> 00:26:20,083
Don't do it!

210
00:26:20,127 --> 00:26:22,095
Manni, please!

211
00:26:22,129 --> 00:26:25,326
Wait for me!

212
00:26:26,534 --> 00:26:28,832
I'll be right there.

213
00:26:28,903 --> 00:26:30,894
Please.

214
00:26:31,005 --> 00:26:34,202
Manni, please, wait!

215
00:27:15,149 --> 00:27:16,616
Okay.

216
00:27:20,354 --> 00:27:22,686
Lie down on the floor!

217
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:25,391
On the floor!

218
00:27:31,265 --> 00:27:33,529
Hands behind your head
and keep quiet!

219
00:27:34,568 --> 00:27:36,331
Hands behind your head
and keep quiet.

220
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:41,205
Open the cash registers!
Open all the cash registers!

221
00:27:43,878 --> 00:27:48,178
Open them and lie down !
I'll shoot anybody who bugs me!

222
00:27:49,917 --> 00:27:52,317
I'll shoot anybody who bugs me!

223
00:27:54,321 --> 00:27:55,982
Manni!

224
00:27:57,892 --> 00:28:01,692
- Lola, where were you?
- I couldn't get here faster.

225
00:28:02,296 --> 00:28:05,424
- Will you help me?
- Can't we just get out of here?

226
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,291
Not anymore.
You see the shit I'm in.

227
00:28:10,304 --> 00:28:12,397
Why didn't you wait for me?

228
00:28:12,506 --> 00:28:15,669
I did. You got here too late.

229
00:28:15,743 --> 00:28:17,938
So, are you with me?

230
00:28:18,012 --> 00:28:21,175
Put your hands up! Fast!

231
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,912
Come on!

232
00:28:31,258 --> 00:28:33,783
Drop your gun! Hurry up!

233
00:28:40,434 --> 00:28:41,628
Don't move.

234
00:28:42,837 --> 00:28:44,270
The safety catch is on.

235
00:28:44,338 --> 00:28:47,136
- How does it work?
- The little lever on the side.

236
00:28:47,241 --> 00:28:49,675
Girl, listen--

237
00:28:54,749 --> 00:28:56,683
Don't move.

238
00:28:59,286 --> 00:29:00,878
Come here.

239
00:29:05,593 --> 00:29:07,925
Cover me. I'll grab the cash.

240
00:29:21,175 --> 00:29:23,336
Hurry, before the cops come.

241
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:18,057
Don't move!

242
00:31:48,222 --> 00:31:49,655
Manni?

243
00:31:53,928 --> 00:31:55,862
Do you love me?

244
00:31:58,265 --> 00:31:59,857
Sure, I do.

245
00:32:03,137 --> 00:32:05,537
How can you be so sure?

246
00:32:06,573 --> 00:32:09,542
I don't know. I just am.

247
00:32:10,744 --> 00:32:12,974
I could be some other girl.

248
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,275
Why not?

249
00:32:18,953 --> 00:32:21,080
Because you're the best.

250
00:32:21,155 --> 00:32:23,988
- The best what?
- The best girl.

251
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:27,493
Of all the girls in the world?

252
00:32:28,662 --> 00:32:29,959
Sure.

253
00:32:30,898 --> 00:32:32,490
How do you know?

254
00:32:33,767 --> 00:32:35,758
I just do.

255
00:32:37,604 --> 00:32:40,129
You think so.

256
00:32:40,207 --> 00:32:42,698
Okay, I think so.

257
00:32:43,978 --> 00:32:46,310
- You see?
- What?

258
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,972
You aren't sure.

259
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:51,517
Are you nuts or what?

260
00:32:57,191 --> 00:32:59,819
What if you never met me?

261
00:33:01,095 --> 00:33:02,995
What do you mean?

262
00:33:05,099 --> 00:33:07,533
You'd be telling the same thing
to someone else.

263
00:33:07,601 --> 00:33:10,331
Okay, if you don't want to hear it.

264
00:33:10,404 --> 00:33:13,430
I don't want to hear anything.
I want to know how you feel.

265
00:33:14,208 --> 00:33:17,609
Okay, my feelings say...

266
00:33:20,147 --> 00:33:21,671
that you're the best.

267
00:33:22,616 --> 00:33:26,313
Who is "your feelings" anyway?

268
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,978
It's me.

269
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,055
My heart.

270
00:33:32,126 --> 00:33:34,822
Your heart says,
"Hi, Manni. She's the one."

271
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:38,457
- Exactly.
- And you say...

272
00:33:38,532 --> 00:33:41,558
"Thanks for the information.
See you around."

273
00:33:41,635 --> 00:33:43,660
Exactly.

274
00:33:43,737 --> 00:33:46,467
And you do whatever
your heart says?

275
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,599
Well, it really doesn't
"say" anything.

276
00:33:49,676 --> 00:33:51,268
I don't know.

277
00:33:53,247 --> 00:33:54,839
It just feels.

278
00:33:55,749 --> 00:33:58,411
So what does it feel now?

279
00:33:58,485 --> 00:34:00,783
That someone's asking
rather stupid questions.

280
00:34:00,854 --> 00:34:04,654
Man, you aren't taking me seriously.

281
00:34:04,758 --> 00:34:06,726
Lola, what's wrong?

282
00:34:07,761 --> 00:34:11,822
You want to leave me?

283
00:34:14,568 --> 00:34:16,468
I don't know.

284
00:34:20,574 --> 00:34:22,838
I think I have to make
a decision.

285
00:34:35,289 --> 00:34:39,191
But I don't want to.
I don't want to leave.

286
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,096
Stop.

287
00:34:54,641 --> 00:34:57,303
Lola, are you going shopping?
I need shampoo.

288
00:35:00,247 --> 00:35:03,478
Of course, I knew that Sagittarius
was your ascendant.

289
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:07,850
Sure, the more I think about it,
I don't know.

290
00:35:09,823 --> 00:35:12,587
Yeah, but you're married too.

291
00:36:21,428 --> 00:36:23,555
Watch out, you stupid cow!

292
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:27,064
Fucking bitch!

293
00:37:35,369 --> 00:37:38,634
- Hey! You need a bike?
- No.

294
00:37:38,705 --> 00:37:41,674
- 50 marks, as good as new.
- But it's stolen!

295
00:37:55,989 --> 00:37:58,685
500? What am I supposed
to do with 500 marks?

296
00:38:38,532 --> 00:38:41,023
Tell me, do you want
to have a baby with me?

297
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,098
Yes.

298
00:38:58,485 --> 00:39:01,454
Even if it isn't from you?

299
00:39:06,059 --> 00:39:08,584
Hey, look at that.
Our little princess.

300
00:39:08,662 --> 00:39:10,391
I'm in a hurry, please!

301
00:39:12,165 --> 00:39:13,496
Let me in.

302
00:39:13,567 --> 00:39:17,003
Courtesy and composure
are the queen's jewels.

303
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:21,530
-Let me in, please.
-A little anger is good for the heart...

304
00:39:21,575 --> 00:39:24,408
the circulation, the skin.

305
00:39:44,197 --> 00:39:49,294
I don't care whether it was an accident
or not! Great start for a new love!

306
00:39:49,403 --> 00:39:52,065
If you hadn't neglected me,
it wouldn't have happened.

307
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,800
I have a family!

308
00:39:53,907 --> 00:39:56,899
I can't leave a sick wife and
three kids just to please Her Highness.

309
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:59,604
Your wife is drunk
from morning to night!

310
00:39:59,713 --> 00:40:02,273
So what?
What do you know?

311
00:40:02,349 --> 00:40:05,341
Don't you see
you're bothering us?

312
00:40:07,521 --> 00:40:08,886
Lola?

313
00:40:10,123 --> 00:40:11,488
Hi, Dad.

314
00:40:12,225 --> 00:40:13,988
Why didn't you knock?

315
00:40:15,529 --> 00:40:16,962
What's going on?

316
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:20,431
- What do you want?
- Is she your daughter?

317
00:40:20,467 --> 00:40:22,059
Shut the door.

318
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,731
What do you want?

319
00:40:29,843 --> 00:40:32,505
- I need your help.
- You see that I'm busy.

320
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:34,911
- There's no other way.
- Damn it!

321
00:40:34,981 --> 00:40:37,449
Why are you disturbing me
right now?

322
00:40:37,484 --> 00:40:39,645
I have a problem,
you understand?

323
00:40:43,457 --> 00:40:46,756
- Who's that slut?
- That's none of your business!

324
00:40:56,169 --> 00:40:57,864
Lola, leave.

325
00:40:57,971 --> 00:41:01,372
Go home. Leave me alone.

326
00:41:02,609 --> 00:41:04,167
I can't!

327
00:41:04,277 --> 00:41:05,574
Why not?

328
00:41:06,313 --> 00:41:07,871
I need money.

329
00:41:09,316 --> 00:41:12,615
- Then get a job.
- I will, but I need the money now!

330
00:41:14,588 --> 00:41:18,786
Okay, just so you get out of here.
How much?

331
00:41:18,892 --> 00:41:21,292
No, no. I need lots more.

332
00:41:21,328 --> 00:41:25,526
- What do you mean, "lots more?"
- A whole lot more!

333
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,626
Aren't you ashamed barging in like this?
Can't you see we're busy?

334
00:41:29,703 --> 00:41:32,194
I don't give a shit, you stupid cow!
I have other problems.

335
00:41:34,808 --> 00:41:36,173
Don't you dare--

336
00:42:05,672 --> 00:42:07,299
What?

337
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:26,458
Hey! What's up? What's up?

338
00:42:28,595 --> 00:42:31,587
It just isn't your day today.
Doesn't matter.

339
00:42:31,665 --> 00:42:33,599
You can't have everything.

340
00:43:11,237 --> 00:43:13,000
Come with me.

341
00:43:15,208 --> 00:43:17,039
Have you gone crazy?

342
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:20,876
- Think you can do anything you like?
- Shut up! You go first.

343
00:43:20,947 --> 00:43:25,577
Girl, listen. You don't know
how to use that thing.

344
00:43:27,721 --> 00:43:29,746
Let me make a suggestion.

345
00:43:51,945 --> 00:43:53,435
Get away.

346
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:59,275
- Listen, dear, we can talk it over--
- Fuck off!

347
00:44:13,266 --> 00:44:16,497
- Shit!
- The combination.

348
00:44:20,006 --> 00:44:21,598
Quiet!

349
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:26,276
Lola, what--

350
00:44:27,614 --> 00:44:29,946
what the heck are you doing?

351
00:44:38,191 --> 00:44:39,283
Open up!

352
00:44:52,605 --> 00:44:56,905
Lola, there are cameras everywhere.
You'll never get out of here.

353
00:44:57,010 --> 00:44:59,706
The police will be here
in a second.

354
00:44:59,813 --> 00:45:03,305
You said they always come too late.

355
00:45:03,416 --> 00:45:06,044
Bag it, 100,000.

356
00:45:15,929 --> 00:45:18,159
Come on, little miss.

357
00:45:19,032 --> 00:45:20,659
Leave your daddy alone.

358
00:45:21,634 --> 00:45:24,694
You don't want to hurt anyone,
do you?

359
00:45:24,771 --> 00:45:26,261
I don't know.

360
00:45:43,757 --> 00:45:45,691
- I don't have it.
- Why not?

361
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,394
There's only 88,000.

362
00:45:50,663 --> 00:45:53,996
I'll have to get the rest
from downstairs.

363
00:45:55,869 --> 00:45:59,270
Okay, get going.
Go, go!

364
00:46:00,707 --> 00:46:02,675
Hurry up, man!

365
00:46:59,632 --> 00:47:01,190
100,000.

366
00:47:04,838 --> 00:47:06,430
In there.

367
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,468
Bye, Dad.

368
00:47:56,589 --> 00:47:58,921
I don't believe it.

369
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,500
Hey, girl. Get away.

370
00:48:10,904 --> 00:48:12,599
Get away from there!

371
00:48:20,413 --> 00:48:22,677
Hey, girl, you want to get killed?

372
00:48:28,054 --> 00:48:32,013
Attention! This is the police!

373
00:48:32,058 --> 00:48:34,390
The building is surrounded--

374
00:48:37,563 --> 00:48:40,794
- What a ruckus.
- Do you have the time?

375
00:49:06,259 --> 00:49:07,817
Okay.

376
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,768
Hey, get away!

377
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:20,195
Give me a lift, will you?
Please?

378
00:49:21,607 --> 00:49:23,268
Wait!

379
00:50:29,175 --> 00:50:32,201
Wait, Manni. I'm coming.

380
00:50:32,278 --> 00:50:34,246
I'm almost there.

381
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:38,546
Wait! I'm gonna make it.

382
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:39,337
Lola.

383
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:44,536
What would you do if I died?

384
00:52:45,211 --> 00:52:47,679
- I wouldn't let you die.
- Yeah, well...

385
00:52:49,015 --> 00:52:51,540
what if I were fatally ill?

386
00:52:51,617 --> 00:52:52,948
I'd find a way.

387
00:52:53,019 --> 00:52:57,319
What if I were in a coma,
and the doc said, "One more day"?

388
00:52:57,390 --> 00:53:00,291
I'd throw you into the ocean--
shock therapy.
dthOwy0uintotheoceanShOCktherapy

389
00:53:00,393 --> 00:53:03,556
What if I were dead anyway?

390
00:53:05,598 --> 00:53:07,793
- What do you want to hear?
- Come on. Tell me.

391
00:53:09,035 --> 00:53:11,902
I'd go to the Isle of Rugen
and cast your ashes to the wind.

392
00:53:12,004 --> 00:53:13,232
And then?

393
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:17,140
I don't know.
It's a stupid question.

394
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:21,613
I know what you'd do.
You'd forget me.

395
00:53:21,647 --> 00:53:23,239
- No!
- Sure you would.

396
00:53:23,316 --> 00:53:29,118
What else could you do?
Sure, you'd mourn for a few weeks.

397
00:53:29,155 --> 00:53:33,558
Not a bad idea.
And everybody's real compassionate...

398
00:53:33,626 --> 00:53:38,427
and everything's so incredibly sad,
and everyone feels sorry for you.

399
00:53:39,565 --> 00:53:44,264
You can show everyone how strong you
are. "What a great woman," they'll say.

400
00:53:44,337 --> 00:53:48,000
"She really pulls herself together
instead of crying all day."

401
00:53:50,142 --> 00:53:53,737
And all at once this really nice guy
with green eyes shows up.

402
00:53:53,846 --> 00:53:57,179
And he's super sensitive,
listens to you all day.

403
00:53:57,250 --> 00:53:59,184
And you can talk his ear off.

404
00:53:59,952 --> 00:54:02,853
And you can tell him
how tough things are for you...

405
00:54:02,888 --> 00:54:06,654
and that you have to look after yourself
and don't know what's gonna happen...

406
00:54:06,759 --> 00:54:09,956
and blah, blah, blah.

407
00:54:10,062 --> 00:54:14,499
Then you'd hop onto his lap and cross me
off your list. That's how it goes.

408
00:54:15,968 --> 00:54:18,698
- Manni.
- What?

409
00:54:18,771 --> 00:54:20,705
You haven't died yet.

410
00:54:31,083 --> 00:54:32,641
No?

411
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,726
Lola, are you going shopping?
I need shampoo.

412
00:54:53,306 --> 00:54:56,537
Of course, I knew that Sagittarius
was your ascendant.

413
00:54:56,609 --> 00:55:00,909
Sure, the more I think about it,
I don't know.

414
00:55:02,915 --> 00:55:05,645
Yeah, but you're married too.

415
00:56:56,862 --> 00:56:59,695
- Watch out!
- Sorry.

416
00:56:59,765 --> 00:57:01,733
I bet you're sorry.

417
00:57:21,754 --> 00:57:23,847
Fries and a sausage.

418
00:57:23,956 --> 00:57:26,015
Give me another one.

419
00:57:29,995 --> 00:57:32,395
I'll be damned.

420
00:57:32,465 --> 00:57:34,899
Life's really crazy sometimes,
isn't it?

421
00:57:38,103 --> 00:57:41,163
Come on, kid.
I'll buy you a drink.

422
00:57:43,008 --> 00:57:44,600
You need a bike?

423
00:57:46,412 --> 00:57:49,142
A special price, 70 marks.

424
00:58:03,996 --> 00:58:05,793
Lola?

425
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,791
Mr. Meyer?

426
00:58:09,835 --> 00:58:11,666
Is everything okay?

427
00:58:11,737 --> 00:58:13,170
No.

428
00:58:40,933 --> 00:58:44,460
Tell me, do you want
to have a baby with me?

429
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:49,698
Yes.

430
00:58:53,145 --> 00:58:54,874
Mr. Meyer is here.

431
00:58:56,382 --> 00:58:58,714
- There's something else.
- Not now.

432
00:58:58,784 --> 00:59:01,514
Mr. Meyer asked if he should park,
or if you're coming out.

433
00:59:01,587 --> 00:59:03,487
Coming.

434
00:59:03,556 --> 00:59:06,491
That's the nicest present
you could ever give me.

435
00:59:12,965 --> 00:59:14,899
Can we meet later on?

436
00:59:31,083 --> 00:59:32,983
Hi there.

437
00:59:39,625 --> 00:59:40,983
Hi there, Ms. Jager.

438
00:59:57,543 --> 00:59:59,670
- Hi there.
- Hello.

439
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:10,149
Hi.

440
01:00:31,877 --> 01:00:34,049
- Nice to see you.
- Hello, Mr. Meyer.

441
01:00:41,053 --> 01:00:42,543
Dad!

442
01:00:49,862 --> 01:00:51,921
Wait!

443
01:00:53,666 --> 01:00:57,864
You know what?
I just had a strange encounter.

444
01:00:57,970 --> 01:01:00,131
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, with your daughter.

445
01:01:00,205 --> 01:01:02,765
- With whom?
- Your daughter.

446
01:01:02,875 --> 01:01:04,274
Dad!

447
01:01:06,578 --> 01:01:08,512
Shit! Shit!

448
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:26,361
You've come at last, dear.

449
01:01:56,528 --> 01:01:58,086
Thanks.

450
01:01:58,163 --> 01:01:59,755
Wait.

451
01:02:27,593 --> 01:02:30,460
So I decided it'd be best
for me not to have kids.

452
01:02:30,562 --> 01:02:33,258
I work so much
that they'd never see me.

453
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:39,632
Watch out!

454
01:03:12,805 --> 01:03:14,705
What can I do?

455
01:03:18,911 --> 01:03:20,845
What can I do?

456
01:03:30,722 --> 01:03:32,155
Come on.

457
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:35,993
Help me.

458
01:03:37,729 --> 01:03:38,957
Please.

459
01:03:40,933 --> 01:03:42,867
Just this once.

460
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:47,202
I'll just keep on running, okay?

461
01:03:52,778 --> 01:03:54,609
I'm waiting.

462
01:03:55,848 --> 01:03:58,408
I'm waiting.

463
01:03:58,483 --> 01:04:01,281
I'm waiting.

464
01:04:01,353 --> 01:04:03,685
I'm waiting.

465
01:04:11,363 --> 01:04:12,955
You wanna get killed?

466
01:04:46,798 --> 01:04:49,096
- How does this work?
- You buy chips...

467
01:04:49,201 --> 01:04:50,828
- and gamble them away.
- Okay.

468
01:04:54,706 --> 01:04:56,503
You can't go in there like that.

469
01:04:56,608 --> 01:04:57,939
I have to.

470
01:04:59,311 --> 01:05:02,337
Ninety-nine marks, 20.
What kind of chips?

471
01:05:02,414 --> 01:05:04,006
One for 100?

472
01:05:05,217 --> 01:05:06,684
You're short.

473
01:05:07,519 --> 01:05:08,850
Please.

474
01:05:44,156 --> 01:05:46,420
Place your bets, please.

475
01:05:54,366 --> 01:05:56,561
Your bets, please.

476
01:06:06,678 --> 01:06:08,612
No more bets.

477
01:06:17,289 --> 01:06:19,757
Twenty, black, even, pass.
No series.

478
01:06:24,896 --> 01:06:26,955
1,500 for black.

479
01:06:33,905 --> 01:06:36,806
One hundred and 400.

480
01:06:40,145 --> 01:06:44,206
Three thousand, five hundred
for 100 marks on 20.

481
01:06:49,154 --> 01:06:51,384
Here you are-- 3,500.

482
01:07:04,870 --> 01:07:06,132
Come with me, please.

483
01:07:11,143 --> 01:07:12,872
Just one more game.

484
01:07:21,653 --> 01:07:23,484
Please place your bets.

485
01:08:29,955 --> 01:08:33,823
Twenty, black, even, pass.

486
01:08:40,332 --> 01:08:44,132
Hurry up. I need a plastic bag.

487
01:09:36,087 --> 01:09:37,748
Stop!

488
01:09:56,508 --> 01:09:57,907
That's mine.

489
01:09:58,009 --> 01:10:00,443
I know!

490
01:10:11,856 --> 01:10:13,323
I'm sorry.

491
01:10:14,125 --> 01:10:16,355
And what about me?

492
01:10:20,232 --> 01:10:23,030
At least give me that.

493
01:11:30,302 --> 01:11:32,463
What're you doing here?

494
01:11:57,062 --> 01:12:00,327
- I'll stay with him.
- What?

495
01:12:53,785 --> 01:12:55,685
Okay.

496
01:13:32,056 --> 01:13:33,614
Manni?

497
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:50,435
Manni?

498
01:15:03,314 --> 01:15:04,338
Hey.

499
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:10,747
What happened to you?

500
01:15:12,824 --> 01:15:14,416
Did you run here?

501
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:19,129
Don't worry. Everything's okay.
Come on.

502
01:15:27,639 --> 01:15:29,539
What's in the bag?
