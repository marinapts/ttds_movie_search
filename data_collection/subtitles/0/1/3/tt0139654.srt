1
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,770
It's time.

2
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,320
Hey, there.

3
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,280
Morning.

4
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,780
How are
you today?

5
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,320
Hey. What are you doing up?

6
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,320
Moo.

7
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,790
Is that daddy?

8
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,790
Hey, there, cowgirl.

9
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,800
She's a little
feisty today.

10
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,300
Babies are supposed
to be sleeping.

11
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,300
I'm too
hungry for my own good.

12
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,300
Yes.

13
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,810
I got to get ready.

14
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,820
Wrong day
to be forgetting stuff.

15
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,820
Listen, everyone is
telling you how lucky you are.

16
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,820
Don't screw this up.

17
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,320
All right. Jesus.

18
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,320
She go back to sleep?

19
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,330
Yep. Ate like a pig.

20
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,830
I know how lucky I am.

21
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,830
I ace this assignment,
department's wide open.

22
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,840
Get my own division someday.

23
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,840
You should see
those guys' houses.

24
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,850
Hello?

25
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,350
Why, yes.

26
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,850
Don't worry.
I will.

27
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,850
Yeah,
he's right here.

28
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,360
Hello.

29
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,410
Hoyt?

30
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,410
Uh, yes, sir.

31
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,410
You on your way
to roll call?

32
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,410
Yeah, I'm on my way

33
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,410
Out the door
right now.

34
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,870
Hoyt.
Uh, yes, sir?

35
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,370
Patrol fairies
go to roll call.

36
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,370
We don't
go to roll call.

37
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,410
OK, that's
good to know.

38
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,880
Listen, there's a coffee shop
at seventh and whitman.

39
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,880
See you there at 10:00.
Be in civvies.

40
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,880
Comfortable shoes.
Got a backup gun?

41
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,880
Something pocket-Sized?

42
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,880
Uh, no, sir,
I don't.

43
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,880
I got the department
issue Beretta.

44
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,430
Good, good.
Bring it. Cuffs too.

45
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,890
Going to be
in the office all day,

46
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,430
But who knows, maybe
we'll do some business.

47
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,390
We're an aggressive unit.

48
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:20,890
I know. Sir, that's
why I signed up.

49
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:21,890
And, you know,
I just want to say

50
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:22,890
Thank you for
giving me this...

51
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,450
What's wrong?

52
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:38,450
I feel like
it's the first day

53
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:39,450
Of football tryouts.

54
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,410
I mean, I wish it was
tomorrow already

55
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,910
So I'd know whether
I made his squad.

56
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,460
Listen, it's not tomorrow,
it's today.

57
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,460
I know it's going to work out.

58
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,460
You do?

59
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,460
Mm-Hmm.

60
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,690
Good morning, sir.

61
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,700
Uh, no,
thank you, ma'am.

62
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,700
Oh, get some chow in you

63
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,200
Before we go
to the office. My dollar.

64
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,700
Uh, thank you, sir,
but I ate.

65
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,210
All right, fine. Don't.

66
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,210
It's nice here.

67
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,720
May I read my paper?

68
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,220
I'm sorry, sir. I...

69
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,720
Thank you.

70
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,220
You know what? I'll get
something to eat.

71
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,220
No. Hell, no, you won't.
You fucked that up.

72
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,730
I'm trying to read my paper.
Please, shut up.

73
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,750
I sure wouldn't mind
not roasting

74
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,750
In a hot black and white
all summer.

75
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,760
Tell me a story, Hoyt.

76
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,760
Like, my story?

77
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,260
No, not your story.
A story.

78
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,260
Since you can't
keep your mouth shut

79
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:27,770
Long enough for me
to read my paper,

80
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,270
Tell me a story.

81
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,770
I don't think
I know any stories.

82
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,270
You don't know any stories?

83
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,270
All right,
I'll tell you a story.

84
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,270
This is a newspaper, right?

85
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:39,280
It's 90% bullshit,
but it's entertaining.

86
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,780
That's why I read it,
because it entertains me.

87
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,780
You won't let me read it,
so you entertain me

88
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,790
With your bullshit.
Tell me a story right now. Go.

89
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:49,790
Well, there was
a D.U.I. Stop...

90
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:53,290
A d.U.I. Stop?
Well, let me load up my guns.

91
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,290
A d.U.I.?! Oh, shit!

92
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,800
Listen, all right?
It's good.

93
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:58,800
We were on mid-Watch...

94
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,300
We?

95
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,300
Oh, me and Debbie...

96
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,800
Who's Debbie?

97
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,300
Uh, oh, I'm sorry.

98
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,300
Uh, Debbie Maxwell,
my training officer.

99
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,310
You had a female
training officer?

100
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,310
Yes, sir.

101
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,810
Ah, OK. OK.
All right. All right.

102
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,310
Ha ha ha! So what was she?
Black? White?

103
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,310
She was white.

104
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,820
Ah-Ha. Lick her license?

105
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,320
Uh, what?

106
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,820
A lick her license.
Was she a dyke? A lesbian?

107
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,820
Oh.

108
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,820
Is she any good?

109
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,330
Yeah, she's pretty good.

110
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,830
OK. Pretty good Debbie,
mid-Watch. Go.

111
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,830
All right. So it was
a real quiet night...

112
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,830
Boom!

113
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,830
Ha ha! You never know.
That's the point. Go.

114
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,340
All right, well,
it was a quiet night.

115
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,340
We're rolling
on vanowen. I'm driving.

116
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,840
This Acura,
just a beautiful car,

117
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,340
Comes out a side street,

118
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,840
All over the median.
In excess.

119
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,850
I light it up,
hit the wailer.

120
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:48,850
Guy drives on
like I'm invisible

121
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,350
For 10 blocks
before he pulls over.

122
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,350
All right?
Plates run clean,

123
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,850
So I field test
and arrest.

124
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,350
And I'm belting him
in our unit,

125
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,860
And Debbie's
tossing his car.

126
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,360
She calls me over
to the vehicle

127
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,860
And shows me a snub .38
and 2 shotguns

128
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,860
Fully loaded and locked.

129
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:03,860
No shit?

130
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,360
No shit. So, uh,
she calls our supervisor

131
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:07,370
And I keep searching.

132
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,370
I find 500 grams of meth
in the dash.

133
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,870
Turns out this d.U.I.

134
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,870
Is on bail
for distribution.

135
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,870
He's on his way
to smoke his ex-Partner

136
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,880
Before trial.

137
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,880
Boom.

138
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,380
We prevented a murder.

139
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,380
You go him. That's amazing.

140
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,380
It is.

141
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,880
That you could be out there
with a fine bitch for a year,

142
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,890
And the most entertaining story
that you can come up with

143
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,890
To tell me is a drunk stop.

144
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:38,400
But I don't believe you.

145
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,900
You tapped that ass,
didn't you?

146
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,900
Tell the truth.
You know you tapped that ass.

147
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,910
You put her in the backseat.
Bam! Code x.

148
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:47,910
Look, man, I got a wife.

149
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,910
You got a dick.

150
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,410
You do have a dick, don't you?

151
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:53,410
Yes.

152
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,910
OK, your dick lines up

153
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:55,910
Straight like that, right?

154
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,420
To the right of it
and to the left of it

155
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,920
Are pockets, right?
In those pockets are money.

156
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,090
Look in either one of them,
pay the bill.

157
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,560
Hey, grab that menu
off that window for me,

158
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,560
All right?

159
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,570
Get in. It's unlocked.

160
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,070
Just throw that
in the glove box.

161
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,580
This car is not
from the motor pool.

162
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,620
No, it's not.
Sexy, though, isn't it?

163
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,080
So where's the office?
Back at division?

164
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,080
You're in
the office, baby.

165
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,130
Going up.

166
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,110
Today's a training day,
officer Hoyt.

167
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,160
Show you around.

168
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,620
Give you a taste of
the business, you know?

169
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,660
I got 38 cases
pending trials,

170
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,620
63 in active
investigation,

171
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,620
Another 250 on the log
I can't clear.

172
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,670
I supervise 5 officers.

173
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,130
That's 5 different
personalities.

174
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,130
5 sets of problems.

175
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,130
You could be number 6
if you act right.

176
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,630
But I am holding no
hands, you understand?

177
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:29,630
I am not baby-Sitting.
You got today

178
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,630
And today only
to show me who

179
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,140
And what you're made of.

180
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,640
You don't
like narcotics,

181
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,640
Get the fuck
out of my car,

182
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,640
Go back to the office,

183
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,640
Get a nice, pussy
desk job, you know?

184
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,640
Chasing bad checks or
something. You hear me?

185
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,650
I hear you.
OK.

186
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,150
Why do you
want to be a narc?

187
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,650
I want to, um,
serve my community

188
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,650
By ridding it
of dangerous drugs.

189
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,660
Right. Right. But why
do you want to be a narc?

190
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,660
Ha ha ha. Uh, I want
to make detective.

191
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,160
There you go.
You can do it.

192
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,210
Stick with me.
You can do it.

193
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,160
Unlearn that bullshit

194
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,670
They teach you
at the academy, though.

195
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,170
Don't bring none
of that shit in here.

196
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,670
Shit will get you
killed out here.

197
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,670
I will do anything
you want me to do.

198
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:13,180
My niggah.

199
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,180
Roll your window down.
Start there.

200
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,720
Ha ha ha. See, you got to
hear the street.

201
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,220
You got to smell it,
you know?

202
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,230
You got to taste that
shit, feel it.

203
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,190
How's your Espaol?

204
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,690
Um...mas o menos.

205
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,190
Learn that shit,
brother.

206
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,190
Learn that shit.
That shit will get you killed.

207
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,190
These motherfuckers out here
plotting all kinds of shit

208
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,700
Behind your back.

209
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,200
Shit, man. You going to
teach me that old school,

210
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,200
Hard charging,
beat up everything that moves,

211
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,200
Rodney king shit?

212
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
We don't do that no more.
That day's dead, dog.

213
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
We don't roll
like that no more.

214
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,750
Now we use this.
Brain power.

215
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,250
These niggahs are
too strong out here anyway.

216
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,210
You think I'm crazy,
right? Huh?

217
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,250
I don't know what to think.

218
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,210
Yeah?

219
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,210
Yeah.

220
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,710
Good.

221
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,220
Good.

222
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,770
Ah...

223
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:07,770
How long have
you been married?

224
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,270
About a year.

225
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,230
Yeah?
Yeah.

226
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,230
You got
a kid, right?

227
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,740
That's right. A little girl.
9 months old.

228
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,740
Yeah. I got 4.
Boys.

229
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,740
You need a son,
you let me know.

230
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,740
I'll hook your old
lady up, you know?

231
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,740
I can't miss.

232
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,250
Can we not talk
about my family,

233
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,750
All right?

234
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,250
I respect that.

235
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,250
I'm married.
I got my queen, too.

236
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,760
I remember
what it was like

237
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,760
To have a pretty
young bride.

238
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,760
You probably
fuck her

239
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,760
Face to face,
don't you?

240
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,260
All right, man.

241
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,260
Let's just not talk about
my wife, all right?

242
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,760
Yeah, that's my point,
you see?

243
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,770
You're so in love,

244
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:42,770
The shit is coming
out of your eyes.

245
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,270
The day you bring
your old lady to the office

246
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,270
Is the day that you don't
make it back home.

247
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:50,270
You got to hide that love deep
inside you, you understand?

248
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,780
Otherwise, these maggots
out here on the street,

249
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,780
They'll find it.
They'll use it against you,

250
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,280
And they will chew you up...

251
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,280
Never wear that
wedding ring to work.

252
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,280
I'm serious about that.

253
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,790
All right.
All right. Thanks.

254
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,320
What's here?

255
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,320
Transactions.

256
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,320
You see that
salvatrucha zero head

257
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,330
Sitting over there
on the fence

258
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,330
Trying to act like
he's not slanging dope?

259
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,330
Yeah.
Yeah. That's my boy.

260
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,830
That's my boy neto.

261
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:51,840
The punk's only 17,

262
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,840
But he can kill
with the best of them.

263
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,340
He works for me.

264
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,840
Jesus, he's an...
He's an informer?

265
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,840
Teammate, you know?
I got eyes everywhere.

266
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,340
He gets to pedal
a little reefer,

267
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,840
Make a little cash
for the family.

268
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,350
He gives me
the head's up

269
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,350
When big things
are happening.

270
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,350
Big transactions.

271
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,350
boom. Boom,
boom, boom, boom, boom.

272
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,350
And you trust him?

273
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,350
Damn right I trust him.

274
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,360
I sprung his mom
from I.N.S. Detention.

275
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,860
Here we go.
Here we go. Here we go.

276
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,860
Watch this.

277
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:22,370
That's right.
Come on down.

278
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:25,870
Come on. Look at it.
Sexy, isn't it?

279
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,870
That's right.

280
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,370
See the hand-To-Hand?

281
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:32,380
Yeah, I saw it.
I saw it.

282
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,380
All right. When was
the last time

283
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,880
You did
a felony stop?

284
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,880
Uh, a couple weeks ago.

285
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,380
Good. You need practice.

286
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,880
They look like
college kids.

287
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,880
They'll get education today.

288
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,390
I want the Brady bunch
grabbing glass.

289
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:43,890
I'm going to take the front,
you take the back.

290
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,890
Stay off of the rover.
Let's go.

291
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,900
Yeah, you little fuckers.

292
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,900
Run, baby, run.
That's right.

293
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,910
Police officers.
Let's see your hands.

294
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,920
Police.
Put your hands up!

295
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,420
Put them up!
Put them up!

296
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,420
Driver, right side
passenger, hands on

297
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,920
The windshield. Put them
on the windshield!

298
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,920
You, in the back, hands
on the side of the glass.

299
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,920
Look straight ahead.

300
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,930
Put it in park!
Stick shift.

301
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,930
Grab the keys and throw
them out the window.

302
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:24,930
Grab the keys and throw
them out the window.

303
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:25,930
Put your hands
on your chest.

304
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,430
Put your hands
on your chest!

305
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,430
All right. Fork
it over, smart man.

306
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,940
What?

307
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,940
You know what
I'm talking about.

308
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,940
Aah!
The marijuana.

309
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,440
Give it to me!
Give it to me!

310
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,440
Ow!
Give it to me!

311
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,440
OK, OK, OK.

312
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,440
Sorry, sir. I...

313
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,440
Shut up.
Too late for that.

314
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,440
Give me that pipe
you got.

315
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,450
Down there on
the floor, too.

316
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:43,950
My mom gave me
this pipe.

317
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:44,950
I don't care
who gave it to you.

318
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,450
She could pick it up
in jail. What else you got?

319
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:47,950
Give me them cigarettes, too.

320
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,450
Give me, give me, give me,
give me, give me. Hey!

321
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,450
Control your suspect.

322
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:51,960
Miss, palms
on the glass.

323
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:52,960
you move those hands,

324
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,460
I'll slap the taste
out of your mouth,

325
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,460
You understand me?

326
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,460
Put your face right up
against the glass.

327
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,460
Right there.

328
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,460
Now, what are you
doing down here?

329
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,970
You know this is a gang
neighborhood, don't you?

330
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:02,970
Ow, ow! Yeah, yeah!

331
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:03,970
You know it's
a gang neighborhood?

332
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,970
Then don't
come down here.

333
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,970
I see you
down here again,

334
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,470
I'm going to
take your vehicle.

335
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,470
I'm going to
...make you walk home.

336
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,480
I'm going to let
the homeboys up the hill...

337
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,480
...Run a train
on your girlfriend.

338
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,980
You know what a train
is, don't you, huh?

339
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,480
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

340
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,980
All right, gentlemen.

341
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,490
Thanks for
your cooperation.

342
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:25,990
Let's go.
Safe your iron, son.

343
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,490
Shit!

344
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:41,550
I like that shit.

345
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,550
Hey, I like the way
you moved out there.

346
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,550
You were trained
very well.

347
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,550
Check that out.

348
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:48,050
It's a shitty dime.
See the small hairs,

349
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,050
Undeveloped seeds...

350
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,060
All the stems in it?
See how immature it is?

351
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,560
That's classic
brick-Pack Mexican.

352
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,560
That's garbage.

353
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,560
Let me see. Give me.

354
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:56,560
Yeah, it's old, too.

355
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:57,560
Shit is probably
from last year.

356
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,560
To be truly effective,

357
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,070
A good narcotics agent
must know and love narcotics.

358
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,570
In fact,
a good narcotics agent

359
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:10,080
Should have narcotics
in his blood.

360
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,580
what...

361
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,580
What, are you going to
smoke that?

362
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,080
Nope, you are.

363
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,080
hell if I am.

364
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,080
Yeah? Yeah?
You're not?

365
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,090
No.

366
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,090
Why, you a Mormon
or something?

367
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,090
You're a Jesus freak?

368
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,590
No, man. I'm not
losing my job.

369
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,590
This is your job.

370
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,590
I can't do that.
Smoke it.

371
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,590
This isn't a test.
Just take a hit.

372
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,600
No, man, listen.
I became a cop

373
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,100
To stop people
from using...

374
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,600
Yeah, yeah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

375
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,600
It's not a review board
and it isn't cocaine.

376
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,100
Take a hit.
No, man.

377
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,610
Jesus Christ.

378
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,610
Yeah, right.

379
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,610
If I was a dealer,

380
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,110
You'd be dead by
now, motherfucker.

381
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,610
You turn shit down
on the street,

382
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:50,620
And the chief
brings your wife

383
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,620
A crisply
folded flag.

384
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,120
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

385
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,120
Talking about...
You know what?

386
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,120
I don't want
you in my unit,

387
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,120
And I don't want you
in my division.

388
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,120
Get the fuck
out of my car.

389
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,630
Go back to
the valley, rookie.

390
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:04,130
Pooping ass.

391
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,640
Give me that thing.

392
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,140
I'll smoke it, man.
Give it to me.

393
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,650
You want me to smoke it,
I'll smoke it.

394
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,660
ah, virgin lungs.

395
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,660
Man up, now.
Man up, niggah.

396
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,160
Here you go.
Go ahead.

397
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,160
Dog, you didn't
even get it.

398
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,170
come on!


399
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:42,670
Shut the fuck up,
and just wait.

400
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,670
Oh, god.

401
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:51,680
man the fuck up.

402
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,680
Finish that shit.
Aha!

403
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,190
Let's go, niggah.
Let's go.

404
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,740
Oh, shit.

405
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,250
You OK, kid?

406
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,260
That was a man-Size
hit you took, dog.

407
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,260
When was the last time
you smoked weed?

408
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,760
Uh, the last... Last,
uh, 12th grade.

409
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,760
We were...

410
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,770
Oh, we were, um...

411
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:22,770
Smoking weed.

412
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:23,770
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

413
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:27,770
Yeah, left that out

414
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,270
Of your service
jacket, didn't you?

415
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,280
Yeah, I knew
you got secrets.

416
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,780
Everybody got secrets.
Didn't know

417
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,780
You liked
to get wet, though.

418
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,780
What's "wet?"

419
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,790
Butt-Naked. Ill.

420
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,790
Sherms. Dust.

421
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:46,290
P.C.P. Primos.

422
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:49,290
P-Dog. That's what you had.

423
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,800
That's what
you were smoking.

424
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,800
You couldn't taste it?

425
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,800
Nah, I never done it.

426
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,300
You have now.

427
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,800
I haven't,
but you have.

428
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:07,810
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

429
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:08,810
Man, I'm going to
get piss-Tested,

430
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:09,810
And I'm
going to get fired.

431
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,320
Lieutenant's got our back.

432
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,320
We know a week
before we piss.

433
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,820
Oh, shit.

434
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:17,820
Shit.
Boom!

435
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,820
Why did you
do this to me?

436
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,830
Ah, you're an adult,
man. Shit.

437
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,330
Nobody told you
to smoke that.

438
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:25,830
You made the decision.
Live with your decision.

439
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,830
Isn't like I put
a gun to your head.

440
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,130
shit, man.

441
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,150
Oh, man. Shit.

442
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,150
Come on. Get your
shit together now.

443
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,150
This is
my dog's house.

444
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,660
We'll see what
he thinks of you.

445
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,170
Brother,
get your ass in here.

446
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,210
roger, what's up, boy?

447
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,170
All right. How they

448
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,170
Give me a pound.

449
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:17,170
All right.

450
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:18,170
I didn't
wake you up, did I?

451
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,180
no, baby.
You know I never sleep.

452
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,180
That's right. Hey,

453
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,180
Come on in.

454
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:27,680
Yeah, time to get
my swerve on here.

455
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,190
What you

456
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,690
What am I drinking?
The best.

457
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:34,190
The best. I know. It's
the best for the best.

458
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:36,690
I heard you had
a beef in Vegas.

459
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,190
There's a green light
on your ass.

460
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,700
Nah, no problem.
It's all good.

461
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,200
the Russians
want your head.

462
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,200
You know I got your back.

463
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,740
I know that.
Thank you.

464
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,200
Here.

465
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,710
Get that medicine
up in you.

466
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,210
Back to
the world, dog.

467
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,710
Back to the world.

468
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,220
You went and got yourself
a daisy fresh rookie.

469
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,730
Jesus, Alonzo, he's high
as a motherfucker.

470
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,230
What the hell
you give him?

471
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,230
Oh, Mexico's finest.

472
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,230
Yeah.

473
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,280
oh.

474
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,740
Garbage.

475
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,740
Where did you grow up?

476
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,240
North Hollywood.

477
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,750
what's
your last name?

478
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,750
Hoyt.
Hoyt.

479
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,750
Hoyt. Hoyt...

480
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:37,250
Strong safety,
north Hollywood high.

481
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,260
that's right.

482
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,260
How did you know that?

483
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,800
Yeah, how the fuck
did you know that?

484
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,760
I follow all
the good players.

485
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,760
Uh, excuse me.

486
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:52,270
Strong safety, huh?

487
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,270
it's me.
What's up?

488
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,770
I can't do
a thing for you.

489
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:56,770
It's your mess.
You clean it up.

490
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:58,780
Don't be calling me.

491
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:02,280
Hey...


492
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,280
Here's a joke, boy.

493
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,280
A man walks out of his house
on his way to work,

494
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,290
Sees this snail
lying on his porch.

495
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:12,790
So he picks it up,
chucks it over the roof

496
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,290
Into the backyard.

497
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:16,290
Snail bounces off a rock,

498
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:18,800
Busts its shell up
all to shit,

499
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,300
Lands in the grass.

500
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,800
Hmm? Snail lies there dying.

501
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,810
But the snail doesn't die.

502
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,810
And then after a while,
it can crawl again.

503
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:36,810
And one day the snail
up and heads back

504
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:38,310
To the front of the house.

505
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:42,820
And finally, after,
oh, about a year,

506
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,820
The little guy crawls
back on the porch.

507
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,320
Right then the man
walks out of his house

508
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,830
On his way to work.
He sees this snail again.

509
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,830
So he looks at it,
and he says...

510
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,840
"What the fuck is
your problem?!"

511
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,340
That's not funny.
That's not funny.

512
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,850
What you
laughing for then,

513
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:10,850
...If it isn't funny?

514
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,850
I don't know, man. I...

515
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:15,850
Hey, hey!
You figure that joke out,

516
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:18,350
You'll figure
the streets out.

517
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,360
Shit, there is
nothing to figure out.

518
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,860
That's just some
senseless bullshit.

519
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,860
Don't listen to him.

520
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,860
Yeah, well, I...

521
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,860
I already
figured them out.

522
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,410
Oh, yeah?
Oh, really?

523
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:28,360
Yeah.

524
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,370
You already
figured the streets out?

525
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:31,370
Yeah, well, it's...

526
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:35,370
It's all about
smiles and cries.

527
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,870
Put the drink down, man.

528
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:38,370
This motherfucker is
out of his mind.

529
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,920
Hey, hold on, Alonzo.
Hold on, hold on.

530
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,380
Smiles and cries.
Smiles and cries.

531
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,380
Smiles and cries.
I hear you.

532
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,880
Yeah, you got to...

533
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,390
You got to control
your smiles and cries,

534
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:51,390
Because that's
all you have,

535
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:54,390
And nobody can
take that away from you.

536
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,890
Oh, shit.

537
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,400
What you think, dog?
Hmm?

538
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,900
Think this greenhorn
can handle undercover?

539
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,410
You were just like him.

540
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:11,410
What?

541
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,910
Same silly-Ass look
and everything.

542
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:15,910
Saving the god damn world!

543
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:16,910
Yeah.
Yeah!

544
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,920
Yeah, now that's
some smiles and cries

545
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,420
For your ass.

546
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,420
Yeah. Shit lasted
about a week.

547
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,420
yeah.

548
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,920
I got to get back
to the office.

549
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,420
Thanks for the snort,
dog.

550
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,930
Always good
to see you, brother.

551
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:29,970
Yeah.
Yes, sir!

552
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,430
Mm-Hmm. What you doing
later on?

553
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,930
Stay in the house,
save some cheddar.

554
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,930
I'm less than a year
away from my dream.

555
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,430
Philippine islands,
here I come,

556
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:38,940
And I am never
coming back!

557
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,440
That's right.
Let me go with you.

558
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,400
You're invited.
Aaugh!

559
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,460
Hey.

560
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,960
Open your eyes, man,
you'll feel a lot better.

561
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:09,970
Boom! Come on, man,
sit your ass up.

562
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:16,970
Who are you?

563
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,980
I'm the zigzag man.
Who the fuck are you?

564
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,480
I'm a cop, man.
Watch out.

565
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,980
Alright.
Don't shoot nobody.

566
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:26,980
Why don't you get
that beer in you, man?

567
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,490
That will give you ballast.

568
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:29,490
Oh, no.
For real.

569
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:30,490
Get that up in you, man.

570
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,530
You'll feel better.

571
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,010
Stop the car, man!
What?

572
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,010
Stop the car. Stop...
Stop the car!

573
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:55,010
I saw something.
Stop the fucking car!

574
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:56,510
All right, hold on.
Hold the fuck...

575
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:58,010
Hey. Hey! Hey!

576
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,020
Fuck me, man! Shit!

577
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,530
Police officer!
Get away from the girl!

578
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,530
Get away from her!

579
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,530
I'm going to fuck you, too, cop!

580
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,030
Aah!

581
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,570
We didn't
do shit, man!

582
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:51,570
That bitch is crazy!
Unh!

583
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:58,580
Roll over, man.
Roll the fuck over!

584
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,580
Fucking-Ass prick!

585
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,580
My niggah!

586
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,580
Go ahead, cowboy.

587
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,590
You got
mad squabbles, boy!

588
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:11,590
Thanks for the help.

589
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,090
Yeah, you should have
shot them.

590
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:15,590
What's happening?
Oh, hey.

591
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,590
You're fucking dead!

592
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,090
OK, wait a minute.
Hold it. Hold it!

593
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:20,100
You, too,
fucking white boy!

594
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,600
My cousins are
from Hillside Trece,

595
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,100
And they're going to
blast you fools!

596
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,140
Calm down. Calm down,
all right? Are you OK?

597
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,100
No, I'm not OK.
Look at my nose, man!

598
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,610
It's just a little
nosebleed.

599
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:30,610
Just put a little ice
on it, you're going to be fine.

600
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:32,110
What are you doing
out here anyway? Huh?

601
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,110
These pieces of shit,
they probably got aids,

602
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:36,110
You know? Why are you
not in school?

603
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:39,120
I was just going
to a ditch party...

604
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:42,620
You almost became a part
of the ditch party.

605
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,120
Now, you say
your cousins from where?

606
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,620
From Hillside Trece!
You fucking remember that, too!

607
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,620
Tell your cousins
to get your back,

608
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,130
All right?

609
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:51,130
Grab your bag
and go home right now.

610
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,130
Whoa, I need to get...

611
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,130
Go home right now!

612
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:55,130
We don't need
no statement. Go! Go.

613
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:57,130
Yeah, they're going to
fuck you up, iputo!

614
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,130
We're going to cut them loose?

615
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,140
What, do you want
to beat them up? Go ahead.

616
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,140
Get down. Protect
and serve, brother.

617
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,680
I got a punching bag
at home.

618
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,640
These guys should
be off the streets.

619
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,140
You hear that, homey?

620
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,150
You want to go home, or you
want to go to jail, huh?

621
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,650
What you think?!

622
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:13,650
Ahh. Got room for you
at the booty house.

623
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,650
You ever been
to the booty house?

624
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,150
Huh?

625
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:19,160
Big boys have you
grab your ankles, man.

626
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,160
Suck my dick, bitch!
I know people!

627
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,160
That's how it starts.

628
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,160
What about you, my man?
What you got?

629
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,160
You ain't got nothing?

630
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,670
No, man.
You sure?

631
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,670
Yeah, I'm sure.

632
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:30,670
Where's your horn?

633
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:31,670
I have got no horn.

634
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,670
No?
Uh-Uh.

635
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:36,670
You got money, though.

636
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:39,680
Aw, you lied to me.

637
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,180
You lied to me.

638
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,180
Lucky I don't make you
eat that, dog.

639
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,680
Stand up, you. Stand up.

640
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,690
Stand the fuck up!

641
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:58,700
Yeah. Oh, shit, huh?!
Huh? Huh?

642
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,700
Turn around, sucker.

643
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,710
Turn around.

644
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:12,210
So you like raping
young girls, huh?

645
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:14,710
Hmm? You like to rape
young girls?

646
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:15,710
That's your m.O.?
No, no...

647
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:17,210
That's what you like,
isn't it?

648
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:18,210
You like to rape
young girls.

649
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,720
That's what you like
to do, right?

650
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,220
Don't lie to me.

651
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,220
You told me to "suck
your dick, bitch."

652
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,720
Isn't that what
you said to me?

653
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,230
Look at me.

654
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,270
You wanted me
to suck your dick.

655
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,730
That's what you said,
right?

656
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,730
That what you said? Hmm?

657
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:36,730
Didn't you say,
"suck my dick, bitch"?

658
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:37,730
Don't lie to me. That's
what... You keep telling me,

659
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:38,740
I'm a liar.
You didn't say,

660
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:39,740
"Suck my dick, bitch"?

661
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,240
That's not what
you said to me?

662
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,740
So I'm lying?
Am I lying?

663
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,740
No. Please. Please!

664
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,740
Where is it?
I can't even find it.

665
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:50,250
Let me see.
Pull your pants down.

666
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,750
Pull them down.

667
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,750
Which nut you want?

668
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:58,250
I'll leave you one nut.
Which one you want?

669
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,260
Make a decision.
Make a decision.

670
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,760
All right, all right.

671
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,260
Put your hands
on your head.

672
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,810
Close your eyes.

673
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:11,270
Close your eyes.

674
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,270
Uhh!

675
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,770
You're lucky I have
more pressing business.

676
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:19,280
I'd cut your fucking
dick off

677
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,280
And stick it right up that
little funky ass of yours,

678
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,280
Bitch!

679
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,780
Damn, I'm thirsty!

680
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,280
I want a beer.
What about you?

681
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,790
You want a beer?

682
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:36,290
I'm going to leave
you three to it, man.

683
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,800
Pussy-Ass bitch!

684
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,300
When I see you again, I'm going to
fuck your shit up, bitch!

685
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,310
You aren't going to
see shit coming, man!

686
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,310
I'll sneak up behind you

687
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,810
Like a
motherfucking ninja, man.

688
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:55,310
I'll crack your head open,
you fucking pig! Come on!

689
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,830
That girl's 14.

690
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,830
She all woman, though, man.

691
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,830
You tax that ass
for days, man.

692
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,830
Yeah, keep walking,
bitch! Unh!

693
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:27,180
You want a beer?

694
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,680
No, I don't
want a beer, man.

695
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,220
No? You mad?

696
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,700
You want to book
that 60 bucks, huh?

697
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,700
Here. Go ahead.

698
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,700
Book it
into evidence, man.

699
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,200
Where are your suspects,
though?

700
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,200
You got to go back
and get the suspects.

701
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,700
I don't know where they are.
You let them go.

702
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:53,700
Oh, I let them go.

703
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,210
Yeah, you let them go.
They're...

704
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:57,210
Hey, man, you want
to run and gun, man,

705
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:59,710
Stay in patrol, OK?
This is investigations,

706
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:00,710
Alright?

707
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,710
Let the garbage men
handle the garbage.

708
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,710
We're professional
anglers, OK?

709
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,720
We go after
the big fish.

710
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,720
Chasing them
monkey-Strung

711
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,220
Crackhead motherfuckers
anyway! You know,

712
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,220
They'd have killed you
without hesitating.

713
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,220
That's why they belong
in prison.

714
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,720
For what?
They got beat down,

715
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,220
They lost their rock,
they lost their money.

716
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,230
Them eses from hillside
probably going to smoke them.

717
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,730
I mean, Jesus,
what more you want?

718
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:18,730
I want justice.

719
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:19,730
Is that not justice?

720
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:20,730
That's street justice.

721
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:22,230
What's wrong
with street justice?

722
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,730
Just let the animals
wipe themselves out.

723
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:25,240
God willing! Fuck them,

724
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,240
And everybody
who looks like them.

725
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,740
Unfortunately, it doesn't
work that way.

726
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,740
The good guys,
they die first, right?

727
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:33,790
The school kids and moms,
family men...

728
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,250
They the ones
catch the stray bullets

729
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,250
In the noodle.

730
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:40,250
To protect the sheep,
you got to catch the wolf,

731
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,750
And it takes a wolf
to catch a wolf.

732
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:42,750
You understand?

733
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:43,750
What!?

734
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,300
I said you protect the sheep

735
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,260
By killing
the motherfucking wolves.

736
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,760
No, you didn't hear me.
You listening,

737
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,760
But you didn't hear me.

738
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:50,760
All right, whatever.

739
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,760
Yeah, whatever.
Whatever the fuck ever.

740
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,280
Well, let me
ask you this.

741
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,780
When do you
lock anybody up?

742
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,780
I mean, it seems you're pretty
busy keeping people out.

743
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,280
What the fuck
you talking about?!

744
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,320
You don't know what you're
talking about, Betty Boop!

745
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,780
Got nothing but shit
between your ears.

746
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,780
Shit, they build jails
because of me!

747
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:17,790
Judges have handed out
over 15,000 man-Years

748
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:20,290
Of incarceration time based
on my investigations, OK?

749
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:22,790
My record speaks for itself.

750
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:25,300
How many felons
have you collared?

751
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,300
Huh?

752
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,800
Yeah, I rest my case.

753
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,350
Oh, look, man, I'm not
smoking crack, all right?

754
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:39,810
Glad to hear that. Just
put it in the glove box.

755
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,810
Put the $60
in there, too.

756
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:43,310
That will come in handy
later on.

757
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:46,320
We'll use it like... Like
a credit card or something.

758
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:58,330
Hey, no matter what I say,
you did the right thing.

759
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:01,830
Reminds me
of when I was out there

760
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:04,830
Chasing down bad guys,
rocking their world.

761
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:07,840
That was some pretty amazing
shit you did back there, Hoyt.

762
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,840
thanks.

763
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,840
Hey, I noticed
you applied that, uh,

764
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,850
That choke hold,
though, huh?

765
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:17,850
I thought that was
a no-No procedure, boy.

766
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,850
I was getting
my ass kicked.

767
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:23,850
And you did
what you had to do, right?

768
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:26,400
You did
what you had to do.

769
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,860
That's right.

770
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:35,370
That's what a wolf does.
You a wolf?

771
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:36,870
Heh heh heh.
Come on, wolf!

772
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:38,370
come on, dog.

773
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:43,920
Heh heh. No, I said
a wolf, not a rooster!

774
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,380
A wolf.


775
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,380
That's a rooster.
Give me a wolf.

776
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,380
Fuck this, man!
Give me that beer.

777
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,880
Alright, there you go.
That's my niggah.

778
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:58,390
You got the magic eye,
Hoyt.

779
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:01,890
You have the magic eye!

780
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:04,390
You up your street IQ,

781
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:06,900
You going to do some damage
out here, I guarantee.

782
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,940
Crime fighter.

783
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,440
What you need, homey?

784
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,450
Uh, crack.
About 20 bucks worth.

785
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,990
Crack?!
Yeah.

786
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:02,450
Smell like bacon
in this motherfucker.

787
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:04,450
What, I look like a sucker
to you, niggah?!

788
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:06,960
Fuck you, rookie!

789
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,960
Go on, fetch, dog.

790
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,470
You want me to...

791
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:17,970
come on, man!

792
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:19,970
Shit!

793
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,520
Yo!

794
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,980
Yo, give me a break, man!
Hey! Yo! Slow up!

795
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,980
Excuse me.

796
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:36,530
Come on, buddy, stop.
I'm a police officer.

797
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:37,990
Police officer!
Stop!

798
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:40,990
Come on, man, give me a break,
all right? Shit!

799
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:42,990
you get out.
You don't look at my things.

800
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:46,000
Get out of here,
or I call police!

801
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,500
Police officer, ma'am.
Calm down.

802
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,540
Yo, man, I said stop,
all right?!

803
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,000
I said stop!

804
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,510
You're making this
so much harder. All right.

805
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,050
Just calm down. Calm down!

806
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,520
You love this shit, huh?

807
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:13,570
hey, man...

808
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:15,070
Pick him up.

809
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,530
Civil rights violating
motherfuckers!

810
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:18,530
Watch his legs.
Watch his legs.

811
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,030
Fuck!

812
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,030
You fucked
with my legs, man!

813
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:24,030
Pick his legs up, man.
Pick his legs up.

814
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,080
You motherfuckers have
got nothing better to do

815
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,040
Than fuck
with me, man?! Shit!

816
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,040
Alright,
who you working for?

817
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,040
Fuck, man, you know I don't
work for nobody.

818
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,050
I'm on disability,
man, shit!

819
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:38,050
That's bullshit. You're
cracking and you know it.

820
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:40,090
Man, I don't sell that shit
no more. You know that.

821
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,550
No rocks?

822
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:44,550
No rocks, man,
but I found this.

823
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:45,560
Oh, no, you don't.

824
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,560
Man, that isn't mine, man.
That motherfucker

825
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,560
Planted that shit
on me, man.

826
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,060
Put me in the front seat
with him,

827
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,100
And I bet I whup his ass!

828
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,560
Yeah.

829
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,070
Who you working for?

830
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:58,070
I told you I don't work
for nobody, man.

831
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,110
Why the fuck
is y'all sweating me

832
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,070
Any-Motherfucking-Way, man?

833
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:02,070
Where the rocks at?

834
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:05,120
I haven't got nothing on me.
I gave it up, dog.

835
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,580
Where the rocks at?

836
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,580
Open your mouth.

837
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,580
What is you, a doctor now?

838
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,630
I'm a dentist.
Open your mouth.

839
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,090
Lift up your tongue.

840
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:21,590
I haven't got shit.

841
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,140
Your partner already done
searched me. I'm straight.

842
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:26,600
Yeah, OK.
You got a pen?

843
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,640
You got a writing pen?

844
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,600
I didn't even see
the motherfucker coming.

845
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,110
You haven't got nothing
in there, right?

846
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,110
Huh?

847
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,110
Nothing, man!

848
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:40,110
You haven't got nothing, huh?

849
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,610
God!

850
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,120
Damn!

851
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,620
Now what is that?

852
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,620
Motherfucking
crack, man.

853
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,120
That's right,
jimmy crack corn.

854
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,670
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

855
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:56,130
Oh, you're
federally fucked now.

856
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,130
You got crack...

857
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,630
And a gun.

858
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:02,630
Now you know with your record,
you can get 10 years per bullet?

859
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,630
Do you know that?
Man!

860
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,140
Now you're going to
give me a name, now.

861
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,680
That's 10
right there, dog.

862
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,640
Come on, man, you know
I am no snitch.

863
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,140
I know you are
no snitch.

864
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,140
Give me a name.

865
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,140
Fuck!

866
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,190
That's 20.
Give me a name.

867
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:17,150
That's 30 years.

868
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:18,690
You want to go to jail,
or you want to go home?

869
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:21,650
He in the county, man!

870
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:23,150
Who?

871
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,150
This niggah
named sandman.

872
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:27,160
That's all the fuck
I know, man. Shit!

873
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,160
Sandman?

874
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,160
Sandman!

875
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,660
See how easy that was?

876
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:34,660
Unhook him.

877
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:37,170
I'm sick of
this shit, man!

878
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:38,670
Want to collect the evidence?

879
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:39,670
Fuck that, man.

880
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,210
my niggah.

881
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:56,730
it's bob.

882
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:59,230
good afternoon, bob.
Yeah, yeah, it's Alonzo.

883
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,230
Hey, listen,
you got your gang book?

884
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:01,230
yeah, what do you need?

885
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:02,730
Yeah, I need
a res on a sandman.

886
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:03,740
Uh-Huh.

887
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,240
Yeah, with the mobsters.
He may be in custody.

888
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:06,740
OK, hold on. I'll
check it out for you.

889
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,740
Yeah, no problem.
I'll hold on.

890
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,740
That stuff
doesn't fly anymore, man,

891
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:10,740
Shoving a pen down.

892
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,740
I mean, what if
that guy complains?

893
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:13,750
To who?...yeah...

894
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:15,250
23130 113th street.

895
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:17,250
Kevin miller,
AKA Sandman, got it?

896
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,250
I like my badge.

897
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,750
Yeah, I got it.
I know where it is.

898
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,750
Out there by, uh,
imperial courts.

899
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,250
exactly, uh-Huh.

900
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,760
Right, OK.
Thanks a lot.

901
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,260
No problem.

902
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,260
We go after sandman?

903
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,760
We go after the sandman.

904
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:21,310
What, are you opening
a circuit city?

905
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:23,820
Nah, it's unclaimed shit
from property.

906
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:27,320
Hand it out to my C.I.S,
witnesses, victims.

907
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,820
Try to help them out
with their families.

908
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,820
Here, put this on.

909
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,830
Come on, let's go.

910
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:36,330
Now listen, intel says
that she lives here alone.

911
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:39,830
She got 2 female juveniles,

912
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:41,830
One possible male juvenile.

913
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:43,330
Well, if he's not here,
why are we here?

914
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:44,840
We're here
to serve this warrant.

915
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,840
come on, man.

916
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,840
We can't do that.

917
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,840
Hell, yeah, we can.
We the police.

918
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,340
We can do the fuck
we want to do.

919
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,340
Why don't we just
get a real warrant.

920
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,840
Listen, we're trying
to get shit done, all right?

921
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,340
Just stand over there
and don't get me killed,

922
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,350
All right, new guy?

923
00:42:57,850 --> 00:42:59,350
Police, we got
a search warrant.

924
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:00,850
LAPD., open up.

925
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:04,360
Kevin isn't here.
He at the honor ranch.

926
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,360
OK, just open the door.

927
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:06,860
We don't want to
have to kick it in, now.

928
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,360
Kevin isn't here.
He up at the honor ranch.

929
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,360
Open the door, ma'am.

930
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,360
We don't want to have
to knock the door down.

931
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,360
he isn't even here.

932
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:13,870
I said Kevin
at the honor ranch,

933
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:14,870
He isn't even over here.

934
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:15,870
Right. We got
a search warrant.

935
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:16,870
Unlock the door,
please, ma'am.

936
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:17,870
damn!

937
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:19,870
Is nobody here!

938
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:21,370
Get your big ass down!

939
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:22,870
Right down! Down!
Get down!

940
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:24,380
Don't move!
Spread them out!

941
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:25,880
Don't move!

942
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,880
Anybody in the house?

943
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,380
is anybody in the house?

944
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,380
My nephew Dimitri,

945
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,380
He's in the bedroom.
He's 10 years old.

946
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:33,380
OK, OK.

947
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:34,890
All right, I'm going to
clear the house,

948
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:36,390
Check her for weapons.

949
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,900
Kitchen's clear.

950
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:58,910
Dimitri?

951
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:00,410
Yeah?

952
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:02,410
Put your hands up, son.
Put them up! Put them up!

953
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:03,420
Anybody else in there?

954
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,420
No.

955
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,420
You sure?
Yeah.

956
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,420
OK, just stay right there,
right there, right there.

957
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,920
Don't move.
Don't you move.

958
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,420
OK, stand up.

959
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,430
Stand up.

960
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:14,430
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

961
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:15,930
Keep your hands where
I can see them.

962
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:17,930
Sit down and place them
on your knees.

963
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:18,930
Just sit down, OK?

964
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:20,430
We're the good guys,
you got nothing to worry about.

965
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:21,930
You just take a seat
right over there,

966
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:22,930
Next to your auntie.

967
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:23,940
Right over
there, son.

968
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:24,940
Right there.
Right over in there.

969
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:26,940
House is code 4.

970
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:27,940
I'm going to
start the search.

971
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:42,450
I want to see that warrant.

972
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:43,460
My what?

973
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:44,460
I want to see the warrant.

974
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:45,960
You... You're supposed
to give me a copy.

975
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:46,960
Yeah, well,
my partner has it.

976
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,960
He'll be out
with it in a second.

977
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:51,960
Where the fuck is your back-Up?

978
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,470
Ma'am, do me a favor,
and just be quiet

979
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:56,970
Until we're through
with our investigation.

980
00:44:56,970 --> 00:44:59,470
Well, you got the gun,
don't you, boss?

981
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:00,470
That's right, I do.

982
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:03,480
Punk-Ass, bitch-Ass,
crooked-Ass cop.

983
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,480
OK.

984
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:05,980
You're a rookie.

985
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:08,980
Give me a break, OK.

986
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:16,490
Dimitri, how you doing
over there, huh?

987
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:17,490
You cool? You cool?
Come on.

988
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:19,990
All right,
don't worry about it,

989
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:22,120
You're cool.
Just stay cool.

990
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:24,660
Great.

991
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:31,170
Ma'am, please stay seated!

992
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:32,130
You come up here like

993
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,130
You pay the rent,
motherfucker.

994
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:34,130
Sit down!
And you all stink!

995
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:36,130
You got to get
liquored up

996
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:37,630
To do your business
up in here!

997
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:39,140
All right,
sit down, now!

998
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,640
You going to shoot me, boss?

999
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,140
Dimitri, close your eyes.

1000
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:48,650
The punk-Ass cop
is going to shoot me!

1001
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:50,650
Sit down, right now!

1002
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:52,150
OK, OK, OK.
Everything is fine.

1003
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:53,650
We made a mistake.

1004
00:45:55,150 --> 00:46:00,160
Didn't find a damn thing.
I'm very sorry. And, uh,

1005
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,160
Thanks for your cooperation.
Let's go.

1006
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,660
I want to see
that warrant!

1007
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,160
What?

1008
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,160
I want to see
that god damn warrant.

1009
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:12,170
Here you go.

1010
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:13,170
Let's go.

1011
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,680
You motherfuckers!

1012
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,680
Hey, jackers!

1013
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:26,180
Listen, you better give me

1014
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:27,180
My fucking money back,
motherfucker.

1015
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,690
You are no police!

1016
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:30,690
Fuck you! Give me my
fucking money back!

1017
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:32,690
Hey, jackers, what y'all
sitting over there

1018
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:33,690
Looking pretty for?!

1019
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:35,190
Blast them fools!

1020
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:36,690
Give me my money back,
motherfuckers!

1021
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:38,190
You are no police!

1022
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:40,700
You are no police!

1023
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,700
Start, you motherfucker.

1024
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,200
Fuck! Gun!

1025
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,200
Shit, man, just get
the fuck out of here!

1026
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,200
Calm the fuck down, OK?
Just stay in the car.

1027
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:52,710
Yeah, motherfucker!

1028
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:15,900
god damn it, man,

1029
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,900
That was not cool, all right?
That was not cool at all,

1030
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,910
Where you're opening fire
in the middle of a neighborhood.

1031
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:24,410
Shit, man,
where was the sandman, huh?

1032
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:26,410
I mean, what the hell
were you doing back there?

1033
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:28,910
I was checking for
narcotics activity, you know,

1034
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:31,410
Drugs, guns, baggies,
you know.

1035
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:32,920
Yeah, cash!

1036
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,420
Speak on it, son.

1037
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:35,920
Man, she's screaming
about money, all right.

1038
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,420
Oh, that bitch
is talking shit!

1039
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:38,920
She's screaming about
trying to get us killed.

1040
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:39,920
Whatever,
all right, man?

1041
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,930
I'm going to be on
the 6:00 news

1042
00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:43,930
In an orange jumpsuit
and handcuffs

1043
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:45,430
Because of you, OK, man.

1044
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:46,930
With the scandals
and what not,

1045
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:48,930
It is open season
on misconduct.

1046
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:50,430
They will nail us
to the wall.

1047
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:51,940
Pull over.

1048
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:53,440
Pull over.

1049
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:54,940
On the highway?
Pull over.

1050
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,440
Shit!

1051
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,460
What?

1052
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,460
Listen,

1053
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:23,470
You're in a privileged position
to learn a thing or two.

1054
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:25,470
Keep your mouth shut
and your eyes open.

1055
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:26,970
You say you're serious

1056
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:28,470
About doing some good
in the real world,

1057
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:29,470
Well, this is
the place to learn.

1058
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:31,470
But if this kind of shit
shakes you up,

1059
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:33,980
Maybe you ought to go back
to your division, you know?

1060
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:34,980
Cry to the watch commander

1061
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,480
To give you a nice job
lighting flares

1062
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,480
Or measuring car wrecks.

1063
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:41,990
You got to decide
whether you're a wolf...

1064
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:44,490
Or a sheep.

1065
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:50,990
Get your ink

1066
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:52,000
Or...

1067
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Go give him a hand.

1068
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:29,200
what are we doing
going in here, man?

1069
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,200
We'll get killed
coming in here.

1070
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,700
Ah, you know about
this place, huh?

1071
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:33,700
Yeah, it's
the jungle, right?

1072
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:34,700
That's right.

1073
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:35,710
They say don't come in here

1074
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:36,710
With anything
less than a platoon.

1075
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:38,210
That's right.

1076
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:50,720
That's the heart
of it, right here.

1077
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,720
Jungle Damu
headquarters.

1078
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,230
Stoners...

1079
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:56,730
Yeah, a lot of
murder investigations

1080
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:58,230
Lead right here.

1081
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:01,230
One way in, one way out.

1082
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:03,730
Thought we were going to get
something to eat?

1083
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:05,240
Hey, don't ever
come up here without me,

1084
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,240
You hear me?

1085
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,240
I'm serious.
For your safety.

1086
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,250
How come you got
the golden pass?

1087
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:16,750
Because I treat
them fair.

1088
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:18,750
They know if
they cross the line,

1089
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:20,250
I'm taxing that ass.

1090
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,270
What's that up there?

1091
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:38,270
They're flipping pigeons.

1092
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:40,270
They want to let everybody
know I'm here.

1093
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,800
One time, what's up, bone?

1094
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:10,300
What's up,
Alonzo?

1095
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,300
What's happening
with you, Damu?

1096
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,300
It's all good,
it's all good.

1097
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:13,300
I just want to tell you,
man, I appreciate

1098
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:14,300
What you did
for my nephew.

1099
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:15,810
That's some
real shit.

1100
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:17,310
For sure. For sure.

1101
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:21,810
Heh.
You better call me.

1102
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:26,820
Man, I'm sick
of this shit, man.

1103
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:28,320
I can't stand
that motherfucker.

1104
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,320
Who are they?

1105
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,820
Nobody. Some
buster-Ass niggahs.

1106
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:32,320
I got them all
under my thumb.

1107
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,320
What's up, Alonzo?

1108
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,320
All right, spider.
What's happening?

1109
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:35,330
What's happening,
dog?

1110
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:36,830
Alright.

1111
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:38,330
Hey, what's up, girl?
Look at you.

1112
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:39,330
Hi, Alonzo.

1113
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:40,330
Go ahead.

1114
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:42,330
All that jelly
and no toast.

1115
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:43,830
Who lives here?

1116
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:45,840
Just one of my lovelies.
You know, one of my dimes.

1117
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,840
A loving touch, you know.
Don't worry about it.

1118
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,850
Policia. Policia, senorita.

1119
00:51:55,850 --> 00:51:56,850
Papi.

1120
00:51:56,850 --> 00:51:57,850
Ah, mami.

1121
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:01,850
Ooh...

1122
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:17,370
New guy. Jake.

1123
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:18,370
Hi.

1124
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:19,370
Hi. Jake.

1125
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:20,370
Nice to meet you.

1126
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:21,870
Come in.
Welcome to my house.

1127
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:22,870
Yeah, yeah, hook him
up with some food.

1128
00:52:23,370 --> 00:52:23,870
You know,
take care of him?

1129
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:24,870
Yeah, of course.

1130
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:26,880
Huh?


1131
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:28,880
All right.

1132
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:29,880
Of course.

1133
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:30,880
How are you?

1134
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:31,880
Good, good.

1135
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,380
Good.

1136
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:34,880
I have cable.

1137
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,390
You watch whatever
you want, OK?

1138
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:39,390
All right, thanks.

1139
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:41,390
This is your house.

1140
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:44,890
I'll be right back.

1141
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:54,900
How you doing?

1142
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:55,910
Fine.

1143
00:52:57,410 --> 00:52:58,910
OK.

1144
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:04,410
Now this...

1145
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:07,420
Is all
El Salvadorian food.

1146
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:09,420
Thank you.
It looks great.

1147
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:13,420
I have to go.

1148
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:16,430
Yeah...all right.

1149
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:02,970
Let's go.

1150
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:04,470
We got a meeting
in 15 minutes.

1151
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:05,480
Yeah, I just need to...

1152
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:07,480
Forget that.
Let's go.

1153
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:09,980
I'll see you, buddy.

1154
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:23,490
Como esta, mijo?

1155
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:24,990
Te portas bien?

1156
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:26,500
Si.

1157
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,500
Si?

1158
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:31,000
Esta...

1159
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,500
Creciendo, papasito.

1160
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:37,010
Creciendo.

1161
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:40,010
You OK?

1162
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:41,510
Si.

1163
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,520
OK.

1164
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:20,430
Here, use this.

1165
00:55:20,930 --> 00:55:21,930
Who's here?

1166
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:23,430
LAPD.'S finest.

1167
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:25,430
Don't speak unless
you're spoken to.

1168
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:26,930
Come on.

1169
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:45,450
Good to see you, gents.

1170
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:47,450
That's my new guy.
He works on my squad.

1171
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:49,950
Jake Hoyt.
Captain Lou Jacobs.

1172
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:50,960
You ever need to talk
to the feds,

1173
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:52,460
You talk to him first.
This is a good man.

1174
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:53,960
He can take
your back for you.

1175
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:54,960
Pleased
to meet you, sir.

1176
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:55,960
Stan Gursky over here...

1177
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:57,960
He runs
the DA. Shooting team.

1178
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,470
You think about him
before you pull the trigger,

1179
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:01,970
Because if you're wrong,

1180
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:03,970
He'll snatch your fucking
nuts out, use them for dice.

1181
00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:07,970
Detective
Doug Rosselli right here...

1182
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:09,470
Handles high-Dollar
theft cases

1183
00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:10,480
For the French
poodle crowd.

1184
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,480
You know,
if you lose a Picasso,

1185
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,980
He'll find it for you
or die trying.

1186
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:13,980
He's a good man.

1187
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:15,480
Pleased to meet you.

1188
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:16,980
Good man.

1189
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:17,980
Should I...

1190
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:19,480
Boom. Shoo.

1191
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,490
Get yourself a baseball
steak or something.

1192
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:24,490
All right, gents.

1193
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:26,990
I don't know why
I'm meeting you.

1194
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:29,490
I don't talk
to dead men.

1195
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:32,000
I am not dead yet.

1196
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,500
Fucking prick.

1197
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:34,500
Excuse me.

1198
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,500
Why the long face,
Doug, huh?

1199
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,510
Feds seize your house
or something?

1200
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:43,010
Fuck yourself,
Alonzo.

1201
00:56:43,010 --> 00:56:46,010
tell him the story.

1202
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:47,010
Come on,
tell the story.

1203
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:49,010
Oh, you think it's
so funny, you tell it.

1204
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:51,020
No, no. It's your story.
You tell it.

1205
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,520
Asshole.

1206
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:58,020
all right,
all right, all right.

1207
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:01,030
There's this...
serial burglar, and, uh,

1208
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:03,030
Chasing him
for 12 months.

1209
00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:05,030
A real slickster,
gave up nothing.

1210
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:07,030
Captain's riding my ass
the entire time.

1211
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:09,030
Sentencing was today.

1212
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:10,540
judge is female.

1213
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:12,540
That's right.
Landers.

1214
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:15,540
Yeah, I know Landers.
She's a sharp lady.

1215
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:19,540
No?

1216
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:20,550
so before
the hearing,

1217
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:23,050
Guy gets hold of
some peanut butter,

1218
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:24,550
Packs his ass crack
with it...

1219
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:25,550
What?

1220
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:28,050
Then he's standing tall
before the bench,

1221
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:29,550
And he's waiting
to give his statement.

1222
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:31,560
So he shoves
his hand down his pants,

1223
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:34,060
Comes out with a gob
of extra-Chunky Jif.

1224
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:39,060
Bailiffs won't
come near him.

1225
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:47,070
Now he's... Now he's looking
the judge right in the eyes

1226
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:49,070
And licks his fingers clean.

1227
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:53,080
Holy shit.

1228
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,580
So the judge says, uh,

1229
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:58,580
"Oh, this poor man's insane.
He can't go to prison."

1230
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:00,090
Orders him to psychiatric.

1231
00:58:00,090 --> 00:58:01,090
She fell for it.

1232
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:04,090
Yeah. That's because
she's so fucking smart.

1233
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:06,090
Time she found out
it was sandwich spread,

1234
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:08,590
The order was signed,
the guy's been transferred.

1235
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:15,600
Proceedings closed.

1236
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,100
Yeah, closed.

1237
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:21,110
That prick will do 6 months
in the puzzle factory,

1238
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:23,110
Then they'll call him normal
and let him loose.

1239
00:58:23,110 --> 00:58:24,610
Never, ever do
a day in prison.

1240
00:58:24,610 --> 00:58:26,110
Yeah, give him
credit, though.

1241
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:27,110
Shit, he worked
the system,

1242
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:29,110
Deserves
his freedom.

1243
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:31,120
Yeah? Think so?

1244
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:33,120
Or not.

1245
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:35,620
I'll tell you what.

1246
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:39,620
I'm going to find
this guy on the street...

1247
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:41,130
And I'm going to do him.

1248
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:48,630
You better take his
bullets from him, Stan.

1249
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:50,640
Shit.

1250
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,140
ahh...

1251
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:54,640
Alonzo...

1252
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,640
Heard you had an expensive
weekend in Vegas.

1253
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:01,150
How did you ever
screw up so bad?

1254
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:03,150
Nothing. It's nothing.
Forget it.

1255
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:04,650
You know, I didn't know.
It's not my town.

1256
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:05,650
I'm not omniscient.

1257
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:08,150
The Russians don't
care if you have a badge.

1258
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:10,160
They'll whack you.

1259
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,660
You ought to hop
a jet out of here.

1260
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:13,660
Why?

1261
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:14,660
It's an easy fix.

1262
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:15,660
How?

1263
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:17,660
I'll just cash
in an account.

1264
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:18,660
oh, yeah?
Yeah.

1265
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:20,170
Whose?

1266
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:21,670
One of my old ones.
My first one.

1267
00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:24,670
It's not a problem.
Look, the guy's

1268
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:25,670
A high-Security risk
anyway.

1269
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:27,170
If I'm not around,
who's going to keep him

1270
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:28,670
Off the radar, you?

1271
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:31,680
I'm just taxing him,
that's all.

1272
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:33,680
OK?

1273
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,440
Well, it's your call.

1274
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:45,940
I do not want you
to dick this up.

1275
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:48,440
I do not want to see you
on the front page

1276
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:50,450
Like those other assholes.

1277
00:59:50,450 --> 00:59:52,450
Yeah, I understand.

1278
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:55,950
Who's driving?

1279
00:59:55,950 --> 00:59:57,450
Uh, me.

1280
00:59:57,450 --> 00:59:58,450
Grey Mercedes.

1281
00:59:58,450 --> 00:59:59,870
OK.

1282
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:01,870
Get the car.

1283
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:04,380
All right. All right.

1284
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:06,880
Uh, what, the black
Monte Carlo there

1285
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,880
With the back windows
shot out.

1286
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:23,900
hey, yeah, it's me.

1287
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,400
Listen, we got
the green light.

1288
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,400
Right. That's right.

1289
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,900
I want you to fax
a copy of the warrant

1290
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,400
To the clerk,
get her to get the judge

1291
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,400
To sign it,
and I want you and Paul

1292
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,910
To bring it to me
at location one.

1293
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:35,410
You got that? Now,
get a hold of Jeff,

1294
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:36,910
Tell him to pick up
some tools...

1295
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:38,410
Picks and shovels.

1296
01:00:38,410 --> 01:00:40,910
Make sure he signs them
out from maintenance.

1297
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:42,910
That's right. Copy?

1298
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:44,420
That's right.
All right, hurry up.

1299
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:45,920
Later.

1300
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:50,420
So how much cash
was in that jacket?

1301
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:52,420
40 gs.

1302
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:53,930
What's...
What's that for?

1303
01:00:55,430 --> 01:00:55,930
You really want to know?

1304
01:00:56,430 --> 01:00:57,930
Yeah, I really
want to know.

1305
01:00:57,930 --> 01:00:58,930
Yeah...

1306
01:00:58,930 --> 01:01:00,930
There's nothing free
in this world, Jake.

1307
01:01:00,930 --> 01:01:03,440
Not even
arrest warrants.

1308
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:06,940
Shit, man.
I didn't want to know.

1309
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:19,950
Yo, homes. Check
this motherfucker out.

1310
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:20,950
Nice suit, mark.

1311
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:21,950
beautiful suit.

1312
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:23,960
yeah,
fuck you guys.

1313
01:01:41,470 --> 01:01:43,480
All right.
Nice, nice, nice.

1314
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:45,980
What's up, Alonzo?

1315
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:46,980
You got the picks
and shovels?

1316
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,480
They're in the truck.

1317
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:49,980
You're going to
dig a ditch?

1318
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:53,490
No, you are.

1319
01:01:53,490 --> 01:01:54,990
That's a nice suit
you got on there.

1320
01:01:54,990 --> 01:01:55,990
that's
what I said.

1321
01:01:57,990 --> 01:01:58,490
What up, killer?

1322
01:01:58,990 --> 01:01:59,990
I can't call it.
What's up with you?

1323
01:02:00,490 --> 01:02:01,990
I've been hearing
a lot of shit

1324
01:02:01,990 --> 01:02:03,500
Out here on these streets,
man. You all right?

1325
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:05,000
It's all good. I talked
to the 3 wise men.

1326
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Everything is lovely.

1327
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Shit, if you say
we can get away with it,

1328
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:09,500
I'm with you.
Know what I'm saying?

1329
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:12,000
Who the fuck is this?

1330
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,010
Jake Hoyt. It's
my first day in the unit.

1331
01:02:14,510 --> 01:02:16,010
I'm from valley patrol.

1332
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:19,010
You a long way
from Starbucks, homey.

1333
01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:23,010
Now, why the fuck
is he in on this?

1334
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:25,020
Got to get his cherry
popped sometime.

1335
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:26,520
Look, man, stay the fuck
out of my way, all right?

1336
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:30,020
It's just for
the big dogs. Feel me?

1337
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:31,520
Here it is, dog.

1338
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:33,530
It's all good and legit.

1339
01:02:33,530 --> 01:02:34,530
Signed by the judge, OK?

1340
01:02:34,530 --> 01:02:37,030
Thanks to the sandman.
Now listen up.

1341
01:02:37,030 --> 01:02:39,030
Safety is first.

1342
01:02:39,030 --> 01:02:41,530
He gives us shit... Boom,
we're giving him lead.

1343
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:43,540
Let's do this right
so we can all go home

1344
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:45,040
And do the wife
or the girlfriend thing,

1345
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:46,040
All right?

1346
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,540
Let's suit up, ladies.
Time to punch in.

1347
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:36,920
Freeze up!

1348
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:39,920
Down on the floor!
Get down, motherfucker!

1349
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,430
What are you clowns
doing here?

1350
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:42,430
hey, new guy,
watch him.

1351
01:03:42,430 --> 01:03:43,930
If he moves,
cap his ass!

1352
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:45,930
Yeah, I'm on him.

1353
01:03:46,430 --> 01:03:47,430
Do you know what
you're doing, son?

1354
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:49,430
drop what's in
your hands before zero.

1355
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:50,440
5...

1356
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:53,440
4, 3, 2...

1357
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,440
boom.

1358
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:58,940
Give me a reason.

1359
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:03,450
Alonzo's going to have
y'all's ass.

1360
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:05,450
What's up, roger?

1361
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:06,950
What's going down, brother?

1362
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:07,950
Oh, it's all good, baby.

1363
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:13,960
It's all good.

1364
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:17,460
That's for you.

1365
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:23,970
What am I supposed to do
with this, wipe my ass?

1366
01:04:26,970 --> 01:04:28,970
Bad news, dog.

1367
01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:30,480
You don't mind
if I have some of

1368
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,980
Your $300-A-Glass shit
there, will you?

1369
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:33,980
Please.

1370
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:37,980
Had lunch with
the wise men today.

1371
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:40,490
They said you got
to render unto Caesar.

1372
01:04:40,490 --> 01:04:42,490
Fucking vampires
want my pension?

1373
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:44,490
Nah, it's nothing
like that.

1374
01:04:44,990 --> 01:04:46,990
Ahh...

1375
01:04:46,990 --> 01:04:48,490
Hmm.

1376
01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:51,000
They just want to tax
you a little bit.

1377
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
You know,
they got their boats

1378
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,500
And mistresses
and, you know,

1379
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
House payments.

1380
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,500
Nothing I can do
about it, you know?

1381
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:58,500
They're
making me do it.

1382
01:04:58,500 --> 01:04:59,500
I'm just a lowly
civil servant.

1383
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:02,010
ahh,
you're their bitch.

1384
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:03,510
What happens to me?

1385
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:05,010
I got your back, bro.

1386
01:05:05,010 --> 01:05:06,510
I promised you
you'd never have to

1387
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:07,510
Go back to prison.

1388
01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:09,510
You aren't even going to
miss what we take.

1389
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,520
I'm sorry. Orders
is orders, dog.

1390
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,020
No you aren't, cop.

1391
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:18,520
Tim, Jeff, Jake,

1392
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:20,020
We're going to work
in the kitchen.

1393
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:22,030
Grab the tools.
Give me the bitch.

1394
01:05:23,030 --> 01:05:24,530
You guys hold him down.

1395
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:27,530
Who's paying
for my floor?

1396
01:05:27,530 --> 01:05:29,030
The city.

1397
01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:38,540
Right here.

1398
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:47,050
Ow!

1399
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:20,590
That's it. That's
what I'm talking about.

1400
01:06:28,590 --> 01:06:29,590
What's in here, coke?

1401
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:31,600
Don't worry about it.
You'll see.

1402
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:33,100
Hey, grab that hammer
right there.

1403
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:35,100
Knock this lock off.

1404
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:41,110
Yeah. 1, 2...

1405
01:06:44,110 --> 01:06:46,110
Shit...

1406
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:50,120
That's a quarter million
dollars you holding

1407
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:51,120
Right there
in your hand.

1408
01:06:51,620 --> 01:06:53,120
Over 4 million
in here.

1409
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:54,620
First day
on the job,

1410
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:56,120
You hit
a $3 million seizure.

1411
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:57,120
Wait, you said 4.

1412
01:06:57,620 --> 01:06:59,620
Ah, taxation without
representation, brother.

1413
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:00,630
Nothing is free
in this world,

1414
01:07:00,630 --> 01:07:02,630
You lucky
first-Day motherfucker.

1415
01:07:02,630 --> 01:07:04,130
Buy your wife
a minivan with that.

1416
01:07:04,130 --> 01:07:05,130
Put the kids
through college.

1417
01:07:05,130 --> 01:07:06,130
Give me that bag.

1418
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:07,130
No, you know.

1419
01:07:07,130 --> 01:07:09,130
I mean, the only checks
I cash say, uh,

1420
01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:11,140
"LAPD." On them, right?

1421
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:15,640
Somebody didn't sleep
through ethics, did they?

1422
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:16,640
what's the matter?

1423
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,640
You don't want
a piece of this, huh?

1424
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:20,650
Well, I...

1425
01:07:20,650 --> 01:07:23,150
No, right?

1426
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:27,150
Not like this.
I mean...no.

1427
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:29,650
No?

1428
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:34,160
right, right, OK.

1429
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:36,160
First time.
You're not comfortable.

1430
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:38,660
I'll hold it
for you, OK?

1431
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:39,660
What about you,
are you comfortable?

1432
01:07:40,170 --> 01:07:42,170
Oh, I'm comfortable.

1433
01:07:42,170 --> 01:07:43,170
How's
your comfort level?

1434
01:07:43,170 --> 01:07:45,170
I'm very comfortable.

1435
01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:47,670
come on,
let's wrap this up.

1436
01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:50,180
Uh, I...

1437
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:51,680
Don't touch a thing.

1438
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:53,680
Evidence.

1439
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:54,680
That's it.

1440
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:01,190
Alonzo, what are those
assholes thinking?

1441
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:02,690
That I'm really
going to stand still

1442
01:08:02,690 --> 01:08:04,690
And let them
horsefuck me?

1443
01:08:06,190 --> 01:08:07,690
Could put you
out of your misery.

1444
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,200
Hey, Jake, here.

1445
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:16,200
Hey, come sit down.
Sit down. Right here.

1446
01:08:20,710 --> 01:08:22,210
I'll tell you a secret.

1447
01:08:22,710 --> 01:08:25,210
When you kill
someone on duty...

1448
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:26,710
They have
to be your slave...

1449
01:08:26,710 --> 01:08:28,210
In the afterlife.

1450
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:34,720
there you go.

1451
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,220
Start an entourage.

1452
01:08:40,230 --> 01:08:41,230
What, you want me
to shoot him?

1453
01:08:41,230 --> 01:08:42,230
Yeah.

1454
01:08:42,230 --> 01:08:44,730
Come on, kid.
Do me a favor.

1455
01:08:44,730 --> 01:08:45,730
Come on.

1456
01:08:46,730 --> 01:08:49,230
Do yourself a favor.
Hit him.

1457
01:08:49,230 --> 01:08:50,740
Are you serious?

1458
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:52,740
Hey, close the blinds.

1459
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:04,750
All right, I'll...
I'll shoot him.

1460
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:06,250
Go.

1461
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:12,260
Pow!
Boom!

1462
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:16,760
Shoot him.

1463
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:18,760
No, man. I'm...

1464
01:09:20,270 --> 01:09:22,270
Youngsters
these days, huh?

1465
01:09:22,270 --> 01:09:23,270
You're not
going to shoot him?

1466
01:09:23,270 --> 01:09:24,270
No, man.
All right,

1467
01:09:24,270 --> 01:09:25,270
Give it to me.

1468
01:09:26,770 --> 01:09:27,770
Rookies.

1469
01:09:27,770 --> 01:09:29,270
Yeah, you want
to get shit done,

1470
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:31,280
You got to get it
done yourself.

1471
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:33,280
Holy shit!

1472
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:37,780
Come on, breathe.

1473
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:39,780
Breathe. There you go.

1474
01:09:42,790 --> 01:09:44,290
Just let it go.

1475
01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:46,790
Breathe, dog.

1476
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,470
Yeah, he's finished.

1477
01:09:57,970 --> 01:09:58,470
Where's the stinger?

1478
01:09:58,970 --> 01:09:59,970
It's right here.

1479
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:05,480
All right, Jeff.

1480
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:06,980
You took fire coming
through the door.

1481
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:09,480
I need
some time off, but...

1482
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:11,480
OK, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, OK?

1483
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:12,480
Watch the shades.

1484
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:13,490
All right.

1485
01:10:13,990 --> 01:10:14,990
OK.

1486
01:10:17,490 --> 01:10:18,990
All right, you ready?

1487
01:10:18,990 --> 01:10:20,990
Kiss me, baby.
One...

1488
01:10:20,990 --> 01:10:21,990
Oh!

1489
01:10:21,990 --> 01:10:24,000
yeah?

1490
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
You all right?

1491
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Yeah.

1492
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,500
I got to give you
one more, though.

1493
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:29,500
Do it.

1494
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:32,000
Ah, fuck!

1495
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,510
All right, listen.
It's not what you know,

1496
01:10:34,510 --> 01:10:36,510
It's what you can prove.
OK, here's the scenario.

1497
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:38,510
Mark and Paul,
you kicked the door.

1498
01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:40,510
Jeff's
the first one through.

1499
01:10:40,510 --> 01:10:43,010
Roger opens fire...
Hits Jeff twice, right?

1500
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:44,020
Fuck.

1501
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:47,020
What's the matter,
one go through?

1502
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:48,520
Shit!

1503
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:50,020
Yeah, man.
You shot him.

1504
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:51,020
You fucking
shot me, man!

1505
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:52,020
All right, all right.

1506
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:53,020
You'll get a medal.
Don't worry about it.

1507
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:54,530
Get me an ambulance!

1508
01:10:54,530 --> 01:10:55,530
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1509
01:10:55,530 --> 01:10:57,530
You want to go to jail
or you want to go home?

1510
01:10:57,530 --> 01:10:59,030
All right, here's
the scenario, all right?

1511
01:10:59,030 --> 01:11:00,030
Let me quarterback
this thing.

1512
01:11:00,030 --> 01:11:02,030
Mark, Paul,
you kicked the door in.

1513
01:11:02,530 --> 01:11:03,540
Jeff's
the first one through.

1514
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:05,040
Roger opens fire...
Bang, bang.

1515
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:06,040
Hits Jeff twice.

1516
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:07,540
Our new guy, Hoyt,

1517
01:11:07,540 --> 01:11:09,040
He's in second,

1518
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:11,040
Drops roger with
some fine shotgun work.

1519
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:12,040
Who shot roger?

1520
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:13,550
New guy...
Came in spraying.

1521
01:11:13,550 --> 01:11:14,550
Paul?
Boot shot him.

1522
01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:15,550
What did
you guys see?

1523
01:11:15,550 --> 01:11:16,550
Hoyt blasted him.

1524
01:11:16,550 --> 01:11:18,550
Yeah, fuck Hoyt, OK?
Ambulance time.

1525
01:11:18,550 --> 01:11:21,050
Done.
Paul, call them up.

1526
01:11:21,050 --> 01:11:24,560
11-49-9-9-8.
Shots fired.

1527
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:27,060
Officer down.
Repeat, officer down.

1528
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:29,560
5951 Baxter street.

1529
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:31,560
Congratulations, son.

1530
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:34,070
You're going to get a medal
of valor for this.

1531
01:11:34,070 --> 01:11:35,570
I didn't shoot him.

1532
01:11:35,570 --> 01:11:37,570
A roomful of cops
said you did.

1533
01:11:37,570 --> 01:11:39,070
But I didn't.

1534
01:11:39,070 --> 01:11:40,070
You did.

1535
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:45,080
A Los Angles
police department

1536
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:48,580
Narcotics officer
was killed today

1537
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:51,080
Serving a high-Risk
warrant in echo park.

1538
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:53,590
Give me the bitch.

1539
01:11:55,590 --> 01:11:58,090
LAPD. Spokesperson

1540
01:11:58,090 --> 01:11:59,590
Said the officer

1541
01:11:59,590 --> 01:12:02,090
Is survived...

1542
01:12:02,090 --> 01:12:03,600
By his wife
and infant child.

1543
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:05,600
Shit gets deeper.

1544
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:06,600
You get the picture?

1545
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,600
Yeah, I got the picture.

1546
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:09,600
Hey, hey, hey!

1547
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,100
That is the second time
you pointed a gun at me!

1548
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:12,600
There will not
be a third.

1549
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:14,110
God damn, boy!

1550
01:12:14,110 --> 01:12:15,610
That's what I'm
talking about, Jake.

1551
01:12:16,110 --> 01:12:18,610
My niggah. Are you all
watching this? That's it.

1552
01:12:18,610 --> 01:12:21,110
It'd be my pleasure to put
a hydra shock in that melon.

1553
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:22,110
Hey, hey, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

1554
01:12:22,110 --> 01:12:23,620
no, but I'm
going to be cool.

1555
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:25,120
Now drop
the fucking gun now!

1556
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,120
You want to shoot me,
Paul, go ahead,

1557
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:27,620
But I'm taking
him with me.

1558
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:28,620
I'm going,
Alonzo.

1559
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:30,120
This motherfucker is
a fed, man.

1560
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:31,620
No, he is no fed.
He's just a choir boy

1561
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:34,130
With a heart that got
the drop on all you fools.

1562
01:12:34,130 --> 01:12:37,130
Listen, everybody just
take a deep breath,

1563
01:12:37,130 --> 01:12:39,130
And just diffuse this thing.
You hear me, Jake?

1564
01:12:39,130 --> 01:12:40,130
You can't pull
this shit on me, man.

1565
01:12:40,130 --> 01:12:42,130
I didn't
sign up for this.

1566
01:12:42,130 --> 01:12:43,130
OK, OK.
I know you're angry.

1567
01:12:43,130 --> 01:12:45,640
Everybody,
just put your guns down.

1568
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:46,640
Hell, no.

1569
01:12:47,140 --> 01:12:47,640
no, no, no, no...

1570
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:49,140
Choir boy first.

1571
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:50,640
Hey, listen to me.
Put the guns down!

1572
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,640
That's an order.
Put them down!

1573
01:13:01,150 --> 01:13:03,150
Use your ears
and you hear me, Jake.

1574
01:13:03,150 --> 01:13:05,160
Sometime we got to take
this shit all the way.

1575
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:06,660
It's not like we do this
every day, all right?

1576
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:09,160
It's just the nature
of the business.

1577
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:11,160
Now, no one will
ever ask you again

1578
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:13,670
To pull the trigger if you
don't want to, all right?

1579
01:13:14,670 --> 01:13:16,170
Hey, mark, where are
you transferring to?

1580
01:13:16,670 --> 01:13:17,170
S.I.S.

1581
01:13:17,670 --> 01:13:19,670
S.I.S.
Detective.

1582
01:13:19,670 --> 01:13:21,670
You give me 18 months,

1583
01:13:21,670 --> 01:13:24,180
I give you a career.

1584
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:25,680
We make the big
seizures, Jake.

1585
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:26,680
We make
the big arrests.

1586
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:28,180
But if you're
in my unit,

1587
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:29,180
You got to be in it
all the way

1588
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:31,180
Or not at all,
you understand me?

1589
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:32,680
I mean, I thought
you were man enough

1590
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:34,690
To handle this shit.
I guess I was wrong.

1591
01:13:34,690 --> 01:13:36,690
5 proven,
decorated officers

1592
01:13:36,690 --> 01:13:38,690
Says that you're
the shooter, OK?

1593
01:13:39,190 --> 01:13:40,690
The investigators
are going to want to pull...

1594
01:13:40,690 --> 01:13:43,190
... a tube of your blood
to check for intoxicants.

1595
01:13:43,190 --> 01:13:45,200
What are they going to find,
Jake? Do the math.

1596
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:47,700
You been smoking P.C.P.
All day, haven't you?

1597
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:49,200
Huh? Remember?

1598
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:50,200
You've been
planning this all day.

1599
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:52,700
I've been planning it
all week, son.

1600
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:55,210
You talk that crazy shit,
I'll make sure your blood

1601
01:13:55,710 --> 01:13:56,710
Gets to the lab.

1602
01:13:57,210 --> 01:13:58,710
You want to walk your little
baby nuts around the block,

1603
01:13:58,710 --> 01:14:00,210
You won't make it
to the corner,

1604
01:14:00,210 --> 01:14:02,710
But if you're cool...
If you're cool...

1605
01:14:02,710 --> 01:14:04,220
You're a hero.

1606
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:06,720
You're a virgin shooter
above suspicion.

1607
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:07,720
Alonzo,
there's 2 shots left

1608
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:08,720
In that other stinger.

1609
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:11,220
We need to just kill
your boy right now,

1610
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:13,220
And say roger got him
coming through the door.

1611
01:14:14,730 --> 01:14:17,230
No, we are
killing nobody.

1612
01:14:17,230 --> 01:14:18,730
This is a good man
right here.

1613
01:14:18,730 --> 01:14:20,730
He's got the magic eye.
I can feel it.

1614
01:14:20,730 --> 01:14:22,730
Just had a little
freak out, that's all.

1615
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:24,740
We all been there.

1616
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:27,240
No, I say he's cool.

1617
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:30,240
And I say nobody is
going to hurt him.

1618
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:32,740
But you do have
a decision to make, Jake.

1619
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:33,750
because in about
10 seconds,

1620
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:37,250
This place is going to be
overrun with blue suits.

1621
01:14:37,250 --> 01:14:39,750
So why don't you
please go outside,

1622
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:42,750
Clear your head...

1623
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:45,260
Or shoot me.

1624
01:14:58,770 --> 01:14:59,770
hey, Paul.

1625
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:06,280
You're dead,
motherfucker!

1626
01:15:06,780 --> 01:15:08,280
You hear me?
You're fucking dead!

1627
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:21,980
Yeah. 

1628
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:27,980
Ha, that's right.
Well, lay off that rice.

1629
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:29,490
All right.

1630
01:16:31,490 --> 01:16:34,490
Yeah, just make sure that
bathtub is clean, homey.

1631
01:16:34,490 --> 01:16:36,490
All right?

1632
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:41,000
All right. Later.

1633
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:46,500
You all right?

1634
01:16:53,510 --> 01:16:55,010
It behooves you
not to dick around

1635
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:57,510
On this one.

1636
01:16:57,510 --> 01:17:01,020
Justifiable homicide
in the line of duty, OK?

1637
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:02,060
Now what happened...

1638
01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:04,060
What happened was murder...

1639
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:05,020
And armed robbery.

1640
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:09,030
Oh, wait. We... We had badges,
so it's different?

1641
01:17:09,030 --> 01:17:12,030
Oh, son, open your eyes.
Can't you see? Huh?

1642
01:17:12,030 --> 01:17:14,030
That man was your friend,

1643
01:17:14,030 --> 01:17:16,070
And you killed him
like a fly.

1644
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:17,080
come on.
My friend, huh?

1645
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:18,030
Yeah.
Tell me why.

1646
01:17:18,030 --> 01:17:22,040
Because he knows
my first name?

1647
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:24,040
Son, this is the game.
I'm playing his ass.

1648
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:27,540
That's my job.
That's your job.

1649
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:30,050
Roger sold dope to kids.

1650
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:32,550
The world is a better
place without him.

1651
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:37,050
Hey, this man was
the biggest major violator

1652
01:17:37,050 --> 01:17:39,060
In Los Angles.

1653
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:41,100
I watched that cocksucker
operate with impunity

1654
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:43,560
For over 10 years,
and now I got him.

1655
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:45,560
This shit is chess.
It isn't checkers.

1656
01:17:53,610 --> 01:17:54,610
What you think we going to do?

1657
01:17:54,610 --> 01:17:57,070
We going to... We going to roll up
in a black-And-White, huh?

1658
01:17:57,070 --> 01:18:00,080
Slap the cuffs on him.
"You're under arrest."

1659
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:02,080
That's a high roller, dog.

1660
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,620
Take the money.

1661
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:08,080
Hey, man, I already told you,
I'm not going to take that.

1662
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:09,090
I'm not going to take that.

1663
01:18:09,090 --> 01:18:11,090
OK, don't. Just burn it,
barbecue it,

1664
01:18:11,090 --> 01:18:12,090
Fish fry it.
I don't give a fuck,

1665
01:18:12,590 --> 01:18:14,090
But the boys will
feel better about it.

1666
01:18:14,090 --> 01:18:15,090
Fuck their feelings.

1667
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:17,140
Jake, you're
not making them feel

1668
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:18,640
Like you're
part of the team.

1669
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:20,100
The team?

1670
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:22,100
You guys are fucking insane.

1671
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:24,600
All right.
I'll go back to the valley.

1672
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:27,600
I'll cut parking tickets,
you know?

1673
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,110
God.

1674
01:18:31,150 --> 01:18:33,110
It... It can't be like this.

1675
01:18:33,110 --> 01:18:34,110
It is this way, man.

1676
01:18:34,110 --> 01:18:36,110
I'm sorry I exposed you
to it, but it is.

1677
01:18:36,110 --> 01:18:39,120
It's ugly,
but it's necessary.

1678
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:41,620
I became a cop
to put away drug dealers,

1679
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:44,160
The poisoners, the criminals,
not to be one.

1680
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:46,120
You sound just like me,

1681
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:47,620
And I know what
you're going through.

1682
01:18:47,620 --> 01:18:49,130
I know what
you're feeling.

1683
01:18:49,130 --> 01:18:50,130
You're scared.

1684
01:18:50,130 --> 01:18:51,130
I'm not scared.

1685
01:18:51,130 --> 01:18:52,130
Yes, you are.
You're terrified.

1686
01:18:52,630 --> 01:18:54,130
Everybody goes through
that the first time.

1687
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:55,670
I went through it.

1688
01:18:55,670 --> 01:19:00,640
The sooner you can match
what's in your head

1689
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:03,140
With what's going on
in the real world,

1690
01:19:03,140 --> 01:19:06,140
The better
you're going to feel.

1691
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:08,190
In this business,

1692
01:19:08,190 --> 01:19:10,150
You got to have
a little dirt on you

1693
01:19:10,150 --> 01:19:12,150
For anybody
to trust you,

1694
01:19:12,150 --> 01:19:15,150
And when all this
is behind you,

1695
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:16,150
There's going to be
a whole other world

1696
01:19:16,650 --> 01:19:19,160
That opens up for you.

1697
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:22,200
I walk a higher path, son.

1698
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:25,160
I can give you the keys
to all the doors.

1699
01:19:25,660 --> 01:19:28,160
What are you talking about?

1700
01:19:28,670 --> 01:19:31,670
My guys are pretty good,
but they're not leaders.

1701
01:19:31,670 --> 01:19:32,670
They're clowns.
You're a leader.

1702
01:19:33,210 --> 01:19:34,710
You want my job?
You got it.

1703
01:19:34,710 --> 01:19:36,170
You want to lock up
poisoners?

1704
01:19:36,670 --> 01:19:38,170
This is the best place
to do it.

1705
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:43,180
But you got to just,
you know, take your time.

1706
01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:45,180
You make detective.
You play the game.

1707
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:49,190
You grow wise, and then
you can change things,

1708
01:19:49,690 --> 01:19:52,690
But you got to change them
from the inside, son.

1709
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:57,690
Let's go downtown
to the station.

1710
01:19:57,690 --> 01:20:00,200
You talk to my guy Stan,

1711
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:01,700
And he'll walk you through

1712
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:04,700
What you got to say
to the DA. Guys, OK?

1713
01:20:12,710 --> 01:20:14,210
OK.

1714
01:20:54,630 --> 01:20:56,630
What the hell we doing now?

1715
01:20:56,630 --> 01:20:58,130
An informant of mine is
up in chino.

1716
01:20:58,630 --> 01:21:01,130
I promised I'd take care
of his family for him.

1717
01:21:05,140 --> 01:21:07,140
I bring them some food,
you know, stuff like that.

1718
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:10,140
Got to help out the family.

1719
01:21:11,140 --> 01:21:12,140
Believe it or not,

1720
01:21:12,140 --> 01:21:15,150
I do try to do some
good in the community.

1721
01:21:15,650 --> 01:21:16,650
It was, like,
right there, right?

1722
01:21:16,650 --> 01:21:18,650
Just right there.

1723
01:21:19,150 --> 01:21:19,650
What's up, dog?

1724
01:21:20,150 --> 01:21:21,150
You know where
you're at, fool?

1725
01:21:26,660 --> 01:21:28,660
What the fuck
you looking at?

1726
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:33,160
All right.

1727
01:21:37,170 --> 01:21:39,170
What's up, punk?

1728
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:06,700
hey, we got some
things for the family.

1729
01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:23,720
Kitchen's this way.

1730
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:24,720
we're on every day.

1731
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:25,720
every day?

1732
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:27,720
OK, tell us a little bit
about that touring thing

1733
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:30,720
With divas of dance 2000.
That sounds exciting.

1734
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:31,720
put the shit
on the counter.

1735
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:33,220
where's the head?

1736
01:22:33,730 --> 01:22:34,730
right through.

1737
01:22:39,730 --> 01:22:40,730
so you're happy?

1738
01:22:40,730 --> 01:22:41,730
oh, yes!


1739
01:22:42,230 --> 01:22:43,230
Now for example...

1740
01:22:43,230 --> 01:22:44,740
I'm going to go
to the head, OK?

1741
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:46,740
I'm going to be 2 seconds.
We rolling.

1742
01:22:47,740 --> 01:22:49,240
Hey, that's nice, homes.

1743
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:51,240
Let me
get the CD player, eh?

1744
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:53,750
You get the blender.
CD player's mine.

1745
01:22:53,750 --> 01:22:57,750
Dreamer, get
your ass in here!

1746
01:22:57,750 --> 01:23:00,750
Count that shit
in the bedroom, huh?

1747
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:03,760
Thanks a lot, eh. I was
doing stuff, you know?

1748
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:06,760
Better learn how to count,
fucking math whiz.

1749
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:09,260
yeah.

1750
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:10,760
You looked at them.

1751
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:11,760
No, I didn't. Now what?

1752
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:14,270
You calling me a fucking
cheater, Tse, or what?

1753
01:23:14,270 --> 01:23:16,270
Deal again, huh, sniper.

1754
01:23:16,270 --> 01:23:17,270
Dama.

1755
01:23:19,270 --> 01:23:20,770
You play cards, cop?

1756
01:23:21,270 --> 01:23:23,270
Uh, nah, not really.

1757
01:23:23,270 --> 01:23:24,280
Hey, you want a beer, homes?

1758
01:23:24,780 --> 01:23:26,280
Something to drink?
Have a cold one.

1759
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:28,280
Eh, no, thanks.
I'm good.

1760
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:30,780
come on,
sit down, eh,

1761
01:23:30,780 --> 01:23:32,780
Play a card game
with us.

1762
01:23:32,780 --> 01:23:34,290
don't be rude, Tse.

1763
01:23:34,290 --> 01:23:35,790
You're the invited guest.

1764
01:23:35,790 --> 01:23:36,790
Why don't you sit down
and play one hand?

1765
01:23:36,790 --> 01:23:37,790
There you go.

1766
01:23:38,290 --> 01:23:39,290
Don't sweat it, judo.

1767
01:23:39,290 --> 01:23:40,790
We aren't
playing for money.

1768
01:23:40,790 --> 01:23:43,290
Nah. It's just we
got to roll in a second.

1769
01:23:43,290 --> 01:23:46,800
Alonzo's taking a shit.
Go ahead. Take a seat.

1770
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:51,800
All right,
I'll play one hand.

1771
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:54,310
What do you guys got
going on here, 5 card draw?

1772
01:23:54,310 --> 01:23:56,310
yeah,
jokers are wild.

1773
01:23:56,310 --> 01:23:57,810
Jokers wild.

1774
01:23:57,810 --> 01:24:00,810
Hey, so, um, why don't you
tell us something, homes.

1775
01:24:00,810 --> 01:24:02,810
How long you been a pig?

1776
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:05,820
I'm... My bad, my bad.

1777
01:24:05,820 --> 01:24:08,820
I meant... I meant...
I meant a police officer.

1778
01:24:08,820 --> 01:24:09,820
That's what I meant.

1779
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:11,320
I been a pig
for 19 months.

1780
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:12,320
Is that right?

1781
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:13,320
That's right.

1782
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:14,330
And you like it or what?

1783
01:24:14,330 --> 01:24:15,330
I should have been
a fireman.

1784
01:24:15,330 --> 01:24:17,330
I need one more.

1785
01:24:20,330 --> 01:24:21,830
What you got, dog?

1786
01:24:21,830 --> 01:24:23,330
3 of a kind, 3 jacks.

1787
01:24:23,330 --> 01:24:25,840
Ahh, chingo.
Didn't get shit.

1788
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:28,340
Pujo, baby! Whoo!

1789
01:24:28,340 --> 01:24:29,840
2 pair!

1790
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:33,850
2 pair! 

1791
01:24:34,350 --> 01:24:36,850
What the fuck are
you doing, sniper?

1792
01:24:36,850 --> 01:24:38,350
Porca won.

1793
01:24:38,350 --> 01:24:41,850
Smiley, homes,
I got 2 pair, eh!

1794
01:24:41,850 --> 01:24:43,350
3 of a kind
beats 2 pair,

1795
01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:45,860
You fucking dumb truck.

1796
01:24:45,860 --> 01:24:46,860
Serio?

1797
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:48,360
serios, Tse.

1798
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:49,860
Hey, you're fucking
stupid, Tse.

1799
01:24:49,860 --> 01:24:50,860
Why don't you
take your medication

1800
01:24:50,860 --> 01:24:52,860
Or something, homes.
Seriously, eh.

1801
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:54,370
I know I'm number one.

1802
01:24:54,870 --> 01:24:55,870
See why we don't
play for money, homes?

1803
01:24:55,870 --> 01:24:56,870
because of this Vato, eh.

1804
01:24:58,870 --> 01:25:00,870
Hey, that's nice, eh.
Let me see your Cohete there.

1805
01:25:00,870 --> 01:25:01,870
What?

1806
01:25:02,370 --> 01:25:03,880
Your gun, homes,
underneath your shirt.

1807
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:04,880
Let him see it.

1808
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:06,380
no, that's
all right, man.

1809
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:07,880
Come on, man. What is it,
like, a .380 stainless?

1810
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:09,880
9 millimeter Beretta.

1811
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:11,880
Like... Like this one here?

1812
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:14,390
Just like that one.

1813
01:25:14,390 --> 01:25:15,390
is that right?

1814
01:25:15,390 --> 01:25:18,890
But see, here's where
the problem comes into play.

1815
01:25:18,890 --> 01:25:22,390
I seen this one.
I want to see yours.

1816
01:25:23,390 --> 01:25:25,900
Come on, Tse. I am
going to shoot nobody.

1817
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:27,900
Ha ha, qu? No.

1818
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:29,400
Come on, homes.

1819
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:31,400
Let me check it out, eh?

1820
01:25:34,410 --> 01:25:35,910
Qu? No.

1821
01:25:40,910 --> 01:25:42,410
Whoo! Damn!

1822
01:25:42,910 --> 01:25:43,920
You learn that
in the academy or what?

1823
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:44,920
yeah, man.

1824
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:45,920
It's a neat little trick.

1825
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:48,420
This is nice, homes.
Nice right here.

1826
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:51,420
Fuck Vato up with this,
huh, qu? No?

1827
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:53,930
Hell, yeah, homes.


1828
01:25:53,930 --> 01:25:55,430
You know what you do
is you aim...

1829
01:25:55,930 --> 01:25:57,430
Kind of like that.

1830
01:25:57,430 --> 01:25:59,930
Ahh, ha ha!

1831
01:26:01,930 --> 01:26:02,930
I just playing
with you, dog.

1832
01:26:02,930 --> 01:26:04,440
Yeah, right. I got to go.

1833
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:05,940
Yo, Alonzo!

1834
01:26:05,940 --> 01:26:06,940
Let me see that.

1835
01:26:06,940 --> 01:26:08,940
kick back
and party, eh?

1836
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:11,440
There is nothing
out there for you.

1837
01:26:11,940 --> 01:26:13,450
What are you
talking about?

1838
01:26:17,450 --> 01:26:18,950
hey, white boy...

1839
01:26:18,950 --> 01:26:20,450
You ask me, homes...

1840
01:26:20,450 --> 01:26:23,460
But that's just,
of course, if you ask...

1841
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:25,460
I think Alonzo played you
for a fool, Tse.

1842
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:28,460
big time, homes.

1843
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:31,960
Wait, where you going?
Where you going? Huh?

1844
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:33,970
It's your deal.

1845
01:26:43,980 --> 01:26:45,980
it's all there.

1846
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:47,980
sure?

1847
01:26:47,980 --> 01:26:50,480
If you don't believe me,
you can count it yourself.

1848
01:26:55,490 --> 01:26:58,490
Alonzo pulled off
a miracle, eh?

1849
01:26:58,990 --> 01:26:59,990
Times are tight.

1850
01:26:59,990 --> 01:27:01,990
Scared up a lot of cash.

1851
01:27:01,990 --> 01:27:04,000
Who did he jack, homes?

1852
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:06,000
I don't know.

1853
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:11,000
He jacked roger.

1854
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,510
Blasted
the fool, huh?

1855
01:27:14,010 --> 01:27:16,510
Alonzo, homes, I think
he's a low-Down, dirty,

1856
01:27:16,510 --> 01:27:20,010
Ruthless Vato, eh,
but I like that, homes.

1857
01:27:20,010 --> 01:27:21,010
I like that.

1858
01:27:21,510 --> 01:27:25,020
no, that's why I
never shake his hand, homes.

1859
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:27,520
He don't respect nada.

1860
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:29,020
You know what
the money's for?

1861
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:34,030
Alonzo,
he's a hothead.

1862
01:27:34,030 --> 01:27:35,530
Last week in Vegas,

1863
01:27:35,530 --> 01:27:37,530
Some Russian
starts talking shit,

1864
01:27:37,530 --> 01:27:40,530
And Alonzo,
he just snapped.

1865
01:27:40,530 --> 01:27:43,030
Beat his ass to death.

1866
01:27:43,030 --> 01:27:45,040
Well, turns out
that Russian...

1867
01:27:45,540 --> 01:27:47,040
He's a somebody.

1868
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:49,540
Now, Alonzo...

1869
01:27:49,540 --> 01:27:52,040
He's into the Russians
for a million.

1870
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:54,550
How do you know that?

1871
01:27:58,550 --> 01:28:01,050
They gave Alonzo
till tonight to pay up,

1872
01:28:01,050 --> 01:28:04,060
But his name's still
on their list, huh?

1873
01:28:04,060 --> 01:28:07,060
Nobody thought he could
get cash that big.

1874
01:28:07,060 --> 01:28:09,560
Good thing he got
his blood money,

1875
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:11,560
because there's
a crew on standby.

1876
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:15,570
If he don't turn up
downtown with the cash

1877
01:28:15,570 --> 01:28:18,070
By midnight, and
not a minute after...

1878
01:28:18,070 --> 01:28:20,070
Whew, your Vato...

1879
01:28:20,570 --> 01:28:22,070
He's dead.

1880
01:28:22,070 --> 01:28:25,080
Hey, pig, you ever had
your shit pushed in?

1881
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:27,580
Your shit pushed in?

1882
01:28:27,580 --> 01:28:28,580
Simple question.

1883
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:30,080
Nah?
No.

1884
01:28:30,580 --> 01:28:32,080
I had my shit pushed in.

1885
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:37,590
Yeah, man, I had my shit
pushed in, bro...

1886
01:28:37,590 --> 01:28:38,590
Big time!

1887
01:28:40,590 --> 01:28:41,590
smiley?

1888
01:28:41,590 --> 01:28:47,100
Sure, I'm always getting
love from the homeys.

1889
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:52,100
hit them!

1890
01:28:55,610 --> 01:28:58,610
Damn, you guys
fucked him up, eh?

1891
01:28:58,610 --> 01:29:00,610
Get the girls next door.

1892
01:29:00,610 --> 01:29:02,610
Dreamer, get the fuck
out of here!

1893
01:29:03,620 --> 01:29:05,120
Oh!

1894
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:06,620
You fucked up.

1895
01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:09,620
You're under arrest,
bitch...

1896
01:29:09,620 --> 01:29:11,620
For being a judo, cop,

1897
01:29:11,620 --> 01:29:13,120
And dogging me
in the mouth

1898
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:15,130
In my own pad.

1899
01:29:15,130 --> 01:29:17,130
You got the right
to be bitch-Slapped,

1900
01:29:17,630 --> 01:29:19,130
You little motherfucker!

1901
01:29:19,130 --> 01:29:20,130
Aah!

1902
01:29:22,130 --> 01:29:24,140
Drag his ass in the tub.

1903
01:29:24,140 --> 01:29:25,640
Motherfucker!

1904
01:29:27,430 --> 01:29:28,930
Come on,
raid his ass!

1905
01:29:28,930 --> 01:29:30,930
Ahh, shit!

1906
01:29:30,930 --> 01:29:32,440
God!

1907
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:33,940
Aah!

1908
01:29:33,940 --> 01:29:36,440
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

1909
01:29:42,450 --> 01:29:44,450
Aah! Aah! Help!

1910
01:29:44,450 --> 01:29:46,950
Help! Help! Help!

1911
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:50,500
Aah. Aah. Shit.

1912
01:29:52,460 --> 01:29:53,960
Aah!
do it, eh?

1913
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:55,960
close the door.
It's going to be loud.

1914
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:00,960
Hey, smiley.
Back up, Tse out of.

1915
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:02,010
Let me get
his money first, OK?

1916
01:30:02,010 --> 01:30:03,510
Hold off, Tse.

1917
01:30:03,510 --> 01:30:05,470
Come on. Hurry up.

1918
01:30:11,470 --> 01:30:13,480
Hey, smiley.
You going to trip out, homes.

1919
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:16,020
Is that your little
cousin or what, eh?

1920
01:30:23,490 --> 01:30:23,990
Where would you get this?

1921
01:30:24,490 --> 01:30:25,490
Oh, fuck! I found it!

1922
01:30:25,990 --> 01:30:26,490
Alonzo
give it to you?

1923
01:30:27,030 --> 01:30:28,530
I found it!

1924
01:30:28,530 --> 01:30:29,530
Where?

1925
01:30:29,530 --> 01:30:31,490
I found it
in MacArthur park!

1926
01:30:31,490 --> 01:30:32,500
where?

1927
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:33,500
MacArthur park.

1928
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
No, homes.

1929
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,500
You fucked up.

1930
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:39,540
Hey, wait up, Tse out of.
I can't even see, homes.

1931
01:30:39,540 --> 01:30:41,050
aah! Please!

1932
01:30:41,050 --> 01:30:42,050
shut the fuck up!

1933
01:30:42,510 --> 01:30:43,510
If you're religious,

1934
01:30:43,510 --> 01:30:45,010
Go ahead and get in
your last prayer.

1935
01:30:45,010 --> 01:30:46,510
Listen to me, man.
Listen to me.

1936
01:30:46,510 --> 01:30:48,010
That girl was being raped,
all right?

1937
01:30:48,010 --> 01:30:50,010
I saw these
2 fucking drug addicts

1938
01:30:50,510 --> 01:30:52,520
Attacking her,
and I stopped them, man!

1939
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:53,560
What?

1940
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:55,020
I swear to god!
I stopped them!

1941
01:30:55,020 --> 01:30:56,020
You're lying to me.

1942
01:30:56,020 --> 01:30:57,020
I'm not lying!

1943
01:30:57,020 --> 01:30:58,020
You're lying to me!

1944
01:30:58,020 --> 01:30:59,520
I swear to god!

1945
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:01,520
She was being raped!
All right,

1946
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:04,030
And I stopped them!
Oh, please, man!

1947
01:31:04,030 --> 01:31:05,030
I got a little kid.

1948
01:31:05,030 --> 01:31:06,030
Shut the fuck up, faggot!

1949
01:31:06,030 --> 01:31:08,030
Blast his ass, homes.

1950
01:31:08,530 --> 01:31:11,030
I have a little girl!

1951
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:13,540
do it, eh.

1952
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:17,540
I'm going to get to the bottom
of your bullshit.

1953
01:31:17,540 --> 01:31:19,540
She's my cousin, homes.
She's a civilian.

1954
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:21,540
Is not right involving her.

1955
01:31:22,050 --> 01:31:23,550
You just fucked up.

1956
01:31:27,550 --> 01:31:29,550
You're lying to me,

1957
01:31:29,550 --> 01:31:32,060
I'm going to blow
your fucking balls off.

1958
01:31:32,060 --> 01:31:33,060
hello.

1959
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:34,560
Hey, what's up, Letty?
What you doing?

1960
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:37,560
Hey, smiley.
Just, uh, doing homework.

1961
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:39,060
You want to talk
to Tony?

1962
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:40,560
Oh, no, no. I want
to talk to you.

1963
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:41,560
Uh, you go
to school today?

1964
01:31:42,070 --> 01:31:43,570
Yep...yep.

1965
01:31:43,570 --> 01:31:45,070
All day.
You didn't ditch?

1966
01:31:45,570 --> 01:31:49,070
No. No. I want to
every class. Why?

1967
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:50,070
I heard different.

1968
01:31:50,570 --> 01:31:52,580
nuh-Uh.

1969
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:55,580
Cops talk to you today?

1970
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:58,580
Um...

1971
01:31:58,580 --> 01:32:00,580
No...no.

1972
01:32:00,580 --> 01:32:02,090
All right, Letty,
tell me what happened,

1973
01:32:02,090 --> 01:32:03,090
OK? Don't bullshit me.

1974
01:32:07,090 --> 01:32:08,090
Um, all right.

1975
01:32:08,090 --> 01:32:10,090
I got jumped by
these 2 crackheads today.

1976
01:32:10,090 --> 01:32:11,090
You got jumped, huh?

1977
01:32:11,090 --> 01:32:12,600
Well, I think
they wanted to, like,

1978
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:13,600
Rape me or something.
I don't know.

1979
01:32:14,100 --> 01:32:15,600
I mean, he just slapped me
around and everything,

1980
01:32:16,100 --> 01:32:19,600
But nothing happened, OK,
because this cop came.

1981
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:20,600
I mean, he came
out of nowhere,

1982
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:21,600
And they almost
killed him, though,

1983
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:24,110
But he kicked
their asses like that.

1984
01:32:24,610 --> 01:32:25,610
This cop,
what would he look like?

1985
01:32:25,610 --> 01:32:27,610
Um, he was a white boy,

1986
01:32:27,610 --> 01:32:30,610
And he looked
real young, too.

1987
01:32:30,610 --> 01:32:32,120
You sure you OK?

1988
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:33,120
Yeah, I'm fine.
Nothing happened.

1989
01:32:33,620 --> 01:32:35,120
Hey, Letty.
Yeah.

1990
01:32:35,620 --> 01:32:36,620
We're going to talk more
about this later.

1991
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:38,120
OK.
All right.

1992
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:40,620
What's up? What happened?

1993
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:42,630
Aren't you going to blast him
or what, homes?

1994
01:32:44,130 --> 01:32:47,630
Vato was telling
the truth.

1995
01:32:47,630 --> 01:32:49,630
Life's a trip,
qu? No?

1996
01:32:50,130 --> 01:32:52,140
This is some
trippy-Ass shit, homes.

1997
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:02,650
Hey.

1998
01:33:06,150 --> 01:33:08,650
Thanks for getting
my cousin's back, huh?

1999
01:33:10,650 --> 01:33:12,160
Here, put this
on your head.

2000
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:14,160
You'll mess up my floor.

2001
01:33:14,660 --> 01:33:17,660
You know this shit
was just business, right?

2002
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:22,670
right?

2003
01:33:24,670 --> 01:33:26,170
Right.

2004
01:34:40,910 --> 01:34:42,910
what you doing
on the block, rookie?

2005
01:34:42,910 --> 01:34:45,420
You know you don't
belong around here.

2006
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:49,420
what's up?

2007
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:51,420
must be lost, motherfucker.

2008
01:35:08,940 --> 01:35:11,440
You got business here,
rookie?

2009
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:13,940
I'm here for Alonzo.

2010
01:36:23,510 --> 01:36:27,020
Hey. Is your dad home?

2011
01:36:27,020 --> 01:36:28,020
In the bedroom.

2012
01:36:28,020 --> 01:36:30,020
He's in the bedroom?
All right, all right.

2013
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:32,020
You want to
open up the door?

2014
01:36:32,020 --> 01:36:33,020
OK.

2015
01:36:33,020 --> 01:36:37,030
Thanks. You watching TV?

2016
01:36:37,030 --> 01:36:39,030
Anything good on?

2017
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:49,540
Do you want me
to call my mom?

2018
01:36:49,540 --> 01:36:51,540
No, I don't.

2019
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:54,540
I'll tell you what I want.

2020
01:36:54,540 --> 01:36:56,550
I want you to find
a good hiding spot.

2021
01:36:56,550 --> 01:37:00,050
Do you have a favorite one,
a favorite place to hide?

2022
01:37:00,550 --> 01:37:02,050
The closet.

2023
01:37:02,050 --> 01:37:04,050
Right here in the closet?
That's perfect.

2024
01:37:04,050 --> 01:37:06,060
OK, open up the closet.

2025
01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:07,560
All right. Good, good.

2026
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:10,560
Can you sit down in there?

2027
01:37:11,060 --> 01:37:13,560
All right. Now stay in here.

2028
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:17,070
Be very quiet.
I'll be right back.

2029
01:37:17,070 --> 01:37:18,570
All right?

2030
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:47,600
it's all good, baby.

2031
01:37:50,100 --> 01:37:51,600
all right.

2032
01:37:55,610 --> 01:37:57,610
You, against the wall.
Move real slow.

2033
01:37:57,610 --> 01:37:58,610
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

2034
01:37:59,110 --> 01:38:01,110
I want you to put
that money in that bag,

2035
01:38:01,110 --> 01:38:02,110
Take your weapons

2036
01:38:02,110 --> 01:38:04,610
And place them inside
that pillowcase right there.

2037
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:09,120
Congratulations, son.

2038
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:11,120
You made it.

2039
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:13,120
You passed the test.
You're a narc. You're in.

2040
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:14,620
Please, put the gun down

2041
01:38:14,620 --> 01:38:16,130
Before you give my girl
a heart attack here.

2042
01:38:16,130 --> 01:38:17,130
Put the gun down.

2043
01:38:17,130 --> 01:38:19,630
I said take the money
and put it in that bag,

2044
01:38:19,630 --> 01:38:20,630
Take your weapons

2045
01:38:21,130 --> 01:38:22,130
And place them
inside that pillowcase.

2046
01:38:22,630 --> 01:38:23,630
You can fuck
your appointment

2047
01:38:24,130 --> 01:38:24,630
With the Russians.

2048
01:38:25,140 --> 01:38:26,140
You're not
going to make it.

2049
01:38:26,140 --> 01:38:29,640
Ohh, OK.

2050
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:32,140
OK. Hand me
the pillowcase, baby.

2051
01:38:32,140 --> 01:38:35,150
Baby! Hand me
the pillowcase.

2052
01:38:35,150 --> 01:38:37,150
So you're going to
hook me and book me, huh?

2053
01:38:37,150 --> 01:38:38,650
You're the one that was
smoking the dust, Jake,

2054
01:38:38,650 --> 01:38:40,150
You're the one that
ran out like a maniac,

2055
01:38:40,150 --> 01:38:42,650
And you're the one
that shot roger.

2056
01:38:44,150 --> 01:38:45,160
Here you go.

2057
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:47,660
And how about
the one on your ankle?

2058
01:38:47,660 --> 01:38:49,160
You want the one
in my back pocket, too?

2059
01:38:49,660 --> 01:38:51,160
Yeah, I would.

2060
01:38:54,160 --> 01:38:55,670
You got one problem,
though, Jake.

2061
01:38:55,670 --> 01:38:56,670
You got no witnesses.

2062
01:38:56,670 --> 01:38:58,170
Who're your fucking
witnesses, huh?

2063
01:38:58,170 --> 01:39:00,670
Roger? Smiley?

2064
01:39:00,670 --> 01:39:02,670
You think my troops
are going to help you?

2065
01:39:02,670 --> 01:39:05,680
It's not what you know.

2066
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:07,680
It's what you can prove.

2067
01:39:08,180 --> 01:39:09,180
Here.

2068
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:13,680
What can you prove, huh?

2069
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:15,190
Nothing. Where's
your evidence, huh?

2070
01:39:15,190 --> 01:39:16,690
It's right there.

2071
01:39:24,690 --> 01:39:26,700
Oh, shit.

2072
01:39:26,700 --> 01:39:29,200
aw,
it's on now, Jake.

2073
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:30,700
Don't move.

2074
01:39:33,700 --> 01:39:35,210
Where you at, Jake?

2075
01:39:35,210 --> 01:39:36,710
Damn.

2076
01:39:36,710 --> 01:39:38,210
Come on out, dog!

2077
01:39:51,220 --> 01:39:53,720
Ah! I see you.

2078
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:55,230
Oh, shit.

2079
01:39:57,230 --> 01:39:58,730
Ha ha ha ha.

2080
01:39:59,230 --> 01:40:01,230
you know,
I'm surgical

2081
01:40:01,230 --> 01:40:02,230
With this bitch, Jake.

2082
01:40:02,230 --> 01:40:03,730
How you want it, dog,
huh?

2083
01:40:03,730 --> 01:40:05,240
Closed casket?

2084
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:06,740
You remember that fool
in the wheelchair?

2085
01:40:06,740 --> 01:40:07,740
How you think
he got there?

2086
01:40:10,740 --> 01:40:12,240
mommy.

2087
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:13,740
Alonzito!

2088
01:40:16,750 --> 01:40:18,250
You see what I see, Jake?

2089
01:40:18,250 --> 01:40:20,250
Officer Hoyt.

2090
01:40:20,250 --> 01:40:22,750
Job number one:
preserve life.

2091
01:40:22,750 --> 01:40:24,750
There's my son.

2092
01:40:25,260 --> 01:40:26,260
Don't hurt him.

2093
01:40:26,260 --> 01:40:28,760
We walking out of here
together, mijo.

2094
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:29,760
no.

2095
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:32,260
no, mijo,
es El cucuy.

2096
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:48,780
no! Alonzito!

2097
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,280
Alonzito!

2098
01:40:54,780 --> 01:40:55,790
You all right?

2099
01:40:55,790 --> 01:40:57,290
I want my mommy.

2100
01:40:57,290 --> 01:40:59,290
I know. I know.
I know.

2101
01:40:59,790 --> 01:41:01,790
Just sit tight,
all right?

2102
01:41:01,790 --> 01:41:02,790
It's going to be
all right.

2103
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:13,300
Ohh, god!

2104
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:15,310
All right, let me see
your hands. Where is he?

2105
01:41:15,310 --> 01:41:16,310
The window.

2106
01:41:16,310 --> 01:41:18,810
Come on, come on, come on!
Get your kid and stay down.

2107
01:41:18,810 --> 01:41:19,810
Alonzito!

2108
01:42:24,870 --> 01:42:26,380
Jesus.

2109
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:46,900
Aah!

2110
01:43:36,450 --> 01:43:37,450
Aah!

2111
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:52,960
Aah!

2112
01:44:05,480 --> 01:44:06,480
Aah!

2113
01:45:49,950 --> 01:45:50,960
Uhh! Aah!

2114
01:45:53,460 --> 01:45:54,960
Ohh!

2115
01:46:22,490 --> 01:46:24,490
hey, man, dude's over
here tripping, in blood?

2116
01:46:24,490 --> 01:46:26,990
It's no fun when the rabbit
has the gun, is it?

2117
01:46:29,490 --> 01:46:30,500
My niggah.

2118
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Hey...

2119
01:46:35,500 --> 01:46:38,000
First Damu puts one
in his head...

2120
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,010
I make you a rich man.

2121
01:46:43,010 --> 01:46:45,510
Come on, now...
who want to get paid?

2122
01:46:47,510 --> 01:46:49,510
Who want to get paid?!

2123
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:53,520
they're not like you.

2124
01:46:55,520 --> 01:46:57,020
You know what
I learned today?

2125
01:46:58,520 --> 01:46:59,520
I'm not like you.

2126
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:01,030
That's good, Jake.

2127
01:47:01,530 --> 01:47:02,530
I'm glad to hear that.

2128
01:47:04,030 --> 01:47:05,530
Good.

2129
01:47:05,530 --> 01:47:06,530
What now?

2130
01:47:07,030 --> 01:47:08,030
Huh?

2131
01:47:09,530 --> 01:47:11,040
What you going to do?
You going to shoot me?

2132
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:14,540
You going to bust your cherry
killing a cop?

2133
01:47:20,040 --> 01:47:21,050
There it is, Jake.

2134
01:47:23,550 --> 01:47:24,550
Hit me.

2135
01:47:25,550 --> 01:47:27,550
You have never killed
nobody before, have you?

2136
01:47:28,050 --> 01:47:30,050
It isn't like
stepping on ants, Jake.

2137
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:32,060
Takes a man to kill.

2138
01:47:34,060 --> 01:47:36,060
You man enough
to kill, Jake?

2139
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:40,070
Hit me right there.

2140
01:47:44,070 --> 01:47:45,570
Kill me, Jake.
Kill me.

2141
01:47:46,070 --> 01:47:47,570
Hit me. Hit me.

2142
01:47:47,570 --> 01:47:50,080
You can't do it.

2143
01:47:51,580 --> 01:47:53,080
Somebody drop
this fool for me.

2144
01:48:10,100 --> 01:48:11,600
You got us
twisted, homey.

2145
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:13,600
You got to put your own work
in around here.

2146
01:48:15,100 --> 01:48:16,100
Alright.

2147
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:17,600
It's like that, bone?

2148
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:18,600
It's like that.

2149
01:48:22,610 --> 01:48:24,110
Player to player...

2150
01:48:24,610 --> 01:48:26,110
Pimp to pimp.

2151
01:48:26,110 --> 01:48:27,610
I don't believe
you shoot me, niggah.

2152
01:48:28,110 --> 01:48:29,610
Don't do it.

2153
01:48:30,620 --> 01:48:32,120
Don't do it.

2154
01:48:32,120 --> 01:48:33,620
Nah, I don't believe you
got it in you, Jake.

2155
01:48:34,120 --> 01:48:35,620
Ah, shit.

2156
01:48:44,130 --> 01:48:45,920
I'm going to get
that gun...

2157
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:47,920
And then I'm going to
get that money.

2158
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:49,930
And you aren't going to do
a damn thing

2159
01:48:49,930 --> 01:48:51,930
because you aren't going to
shoot no cop in the back,

2160
01:48:51,930 --> 01:48:53,430
Are you?

2161
01:48:54,430 --> 01:48:55,430
Don't do it.
You know what

2162
01:48:55,930 --> 01:48:56,930
They give you
for that?

2163
01:48:56,930 --> 01:48:57,930
The gas chamber.

2164
01:48:57,930 --> 01:49:00,440
You know what the gas
chamber smells like?

2165
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:01,440
Pine oil.

2166
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:03,440
That's where
you headed, boy...

2167
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:04,940
To pine oil heaven.

2168
01:49:04,940 --> 01:49:06,440
I'm going to get that gun,

2169
01:49:06,440 --> 01:49:07,940
And then I'm going to
get that money.

2170
01:49:07,940 --> 01:49:09,450
I don't believe you
got it in you, Jake.

2171
01:49:09,450 --> 01:49:11,450
I'm going to go get it
right now.

2172
01:49:11,450 --> 01:49:12,450
Aah!
Oh!

2173
01:49:12,450 --> 01:49:13,950
Shit!

2174
01:49:13,950 --> 01:49:15,450
Aaahhhh...

2175
01:49:15,450 --> 01:49:16,950
You motherfucker!

2176
01:49:16,950 --> 01:49:18,460
The next one
will kill you.

2177
01:49:18,460 --> 01:49:21,460
Ohhh! Son of a bitch!

2178
01:49:21,460 --> 01:49:22,960
You shot me in the ass!

2179
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:25,460
OK. Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait. OK. OK.

2180
01:49:25,460 --> 01:49:27,460
OK. All right, listen.

2181
01:49:27,460 --> 01:49:28,970
Come on, Jake,
I need the money.

2182
01:49:28,970 --> 01:49:30,470
Give me the money, Jake.

2183
01:49:30,470 --> 01:49:32,970
Give me the money, please,
Jake. Give me that money!

2184
01:49:33,470 --> 01:49:34,970
It's not going to happen.

2185
01:49:34,970 --> 01:49:36,470
Oh, you... You
going to jack me now?

2186
01:49:36,470 --> 01:49:37,970
You going to take my own
money from me? Huh?

2187
01:49:37,970 --> 01:49:38,980
I told you,
that's my evidence.

2188
01:49:38,980 --> 01:49:40,480
You want to go to jail
or you want to go home?

2189
01:49:43,980 --> 01:49:45,480
I want to go home, Jake.

2190
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:49,990
Come on. Give me the money
and let me go home.

2191
01:49:49,990 --> 01:49:51,490
Yeah. You want
to go home?

2192
01:49:51,990 --> 01:49:53,490
Yeah, let me
go home, Jake.

2193
01:49:53,490 --> 01:49:55,990
Come on, give me the money
and let me go home.

2194
01:49:57,990 --> 01:49:59,000
Give me the money
and let me go home.

2195
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Come on, Jake.

2196
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
That's right,
come on, Jake.

2197
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:08,000
You don't deserve this.

2198
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,510
OK.

2199
01:50:09,510 --> 01:50:11,010
OK, you
motherfucker.

2200
01:50:16,010 --> 01:50:17,010
Jake.

2201
01:50:17,010 --> 01:50:18,520
Go ahead
and bounce, homey.

2202
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:20,020
Get up out of here.

2203
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:21,520
We got your back.

2204
01:50:22,520 --> 01:50:24,020
what?

2205
01:50:24,020 --> 01:50:25,020
It's like that.

2206
01:50:25,020 --> 01:50:27,020
oh, no,
you didn't.

2207
01:50:27,020 --> 01:50:29,530
Wait a minute.
No, you di...

2208
01:50:29,530 --> 01:50:31,030
Hey! Hey, Jake!

2209
01:50:31,030 --> 01:50:32,030
Hey!

2210
01:50:32,030 --> 01:50:33,030
Jake!

2211
01:50:33,030 --> 01:50:34,030
Jake!

2212
01:50:34,030 --> 01:50:36,030
Jake!
Come back here!

2213
01:50:37,530 --> 01:50:38,540
Jake!

2214
01:50:41,540 --> 01:50:43,040
You disloyal,

2215
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:45,040
Fool-Ass,
bitch-Made punk.

2216
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:47,040
Jake!

2217
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:49,050
I need my money!

2218
01:50:51,550 --> 01:50:52,550
Jake!

2219
01:50:56,050 --> 01:50:57,550
Oh, you motherfuckers.

2220
01:50:57,550 --> 01:51:00,060
Ha ha ha! OK.

2221
01:51:00,060 --> 01:51:01,060
All right.

2222
01:51:01,060 --> 01:51:04,060
I'm putting cases
on all you bitches.

2223
01:51:04,060 --> 01:51:06,060
Huh? You think you
can do this shit?

2224
01:51:06,060 --> 01:51:07,060
Jake!

2225
01:51:08,060 --> 01:51:10,070
You think you
can do this to me?!

2226
01:51:11,070 --> 01:51:14,070
You motherfuckers will
be playing basketball

2227
01:51:14,070 --> 01:51:17,070
In pelican bay when
I get finished with you!

2228
01:51:18,580 --> 01:51:20,580
Shoe program, niggah!

2229
01:51:21,580 --> 01:51:23,080
23-Hour lock down!

2230
01:51:23,080 --> 01:51:26,080
I'm the man
up in this place!

2231
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:28,080
You'll never see
the light of day!

2232
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:30,090
Who the fuck do you think
you fucking with?!

2233
01:51:30,090 --> 01:51:32,590
I'm the police!
I run shit here!

2234
01:51:32,590 --> 01:51:33,590
You just live here!

2235
01:51:36,090 --> 01:51:37,590
Yeah, that's right!
You better walk away!

2236
01:51:37,590 --> 01:51:39,100
Go on, walk away,
because I'm going to burn

2237
01:51:39,100 --> 01:51:40,600
This motherfucker down!

2238
01:51:42,100 --> 01:51:45,100
King Kong
has not got shit on me!

2239
01:51:57,110 --> 01:51:58,620
that's all right.

2240
01:51:58,620 --> 01:52:00,120
That's all right.

2241
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:02,120
Shit. I don't fuck...

2242
01:52:02,120 --> 01:52:04,120
I'm winning anyway.

2243
01:52:04,620 --> 01:52:05,620
I'm winning.

2244
01:52:06,620 --> 01:52:08,120
I'm winning
any motherfucking way.

2245
01:52:08,120 --> 01:52:09,130
I can't lose.

2246
01:52:10,130 --> 01:52:12,130
Shit. You can shoot me...

2247
01:52:12,630 --> 01:52:14,130
But you can't kill me.

2248
01:52:18,130 --> 01:52:19,140
Shit.

2249
01:52:19,140 --> 01:52:20,140
Ha!

2250
01:52:20,140 --> 01:52:21,640
Oh, what a day.

2251
01:52:22,140 --> 01:52:23,140
Ha ha!

2252
01:52:23,140 --> 01:52:24,640
What a motherfucking day.

2253
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:26,640
Heh. Heh.

2254
01:54:02,280 --> 01:54:03,280
Unh!

2255
01:55:22,860 --> 01:55:24,860
A Los Angles
police department

2256
01:55:24,860 --> 01:55:26,870
Narcotics officer
was killed today

2257
01:55:26,870 --> 01:55:29,370
Serving a high-Risk warrant
near LAX.

2258
01:55:29,370 --> 01:55:32,870
An LAPD. Spokesperson
said officer Alonzo Harris

2259
01:55:32,870 --> 01:55:36,880
Was survived by his wife
and 4 sons.

2260
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:38,380
the highly decorated officer,

2261
01:55:38,380 --> 01:55:40,380
A 13-Year LAPD. Veteran...

2262
01:58:06,190 --> 01:58:07,190
Uh-Huh.

2263
01:58:08,190 --> 01:58:12,700
We wolves, baby.
We wolves.

2264
01:58:56,240 --> 01:58:57,240
Fire!

2265
02:00:47,850 --> 02:00:49,350
Number one.
