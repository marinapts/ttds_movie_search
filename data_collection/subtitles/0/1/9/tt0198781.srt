35
00:03:10,087 --> 00:03:12,123
All right,
Mr Bile, is it?

36
00:03:12,207 --> 00:03:14,596
Uh... my friends
call me Phlegm.

37
00:03:14,687 --> 00:03:15,881
Uh-huh.

38
00:03:15,967 --> 00:03:18,083
Mr Bile, can you tell me
what you did wrong?

39
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:19,202
I fell down?

40
00:03:19,287 --> 00:03:21,005
No, no, before that.

41
00:03:21,087 --> 00:03:24,682
Can anyone tell me
Mr Bile's big mistake?

42
00:03:24,767 --> 00:03:25,995
Anyone?

43
00:03:26,087 --> 00:03:27,645
( coughs )

44
00:03:27,727 --> 00:03:28,443
( groans )

45
00:03:28,527 --> 00:03:29,880
Let's take a look
at the tape.

46
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:30,922
Here we go.

47
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:32,998
Uh, right...
puh-puh-puh-puh...

48
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,486
Ah! There, see?

49
00:03:34,567 --> 00:03:36,319
The door.
You left it wide open.

50
00:03:36,407 --> 00:03:37,157
( whiopers )

51
00:03:37,247 --> 00:03:38,839
( all ourouring )

52
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,804
And leaving the door open
is the worst mistake

53
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,401
any employee
can make because...?

54
00:03:43,487 --> 00:03:46,160
Um... it could let in a draft?

55
00:03:46,247 --> 00:03:47,521
It could let in

56
00:03:47,607 --> 00:03:49,563
a child!

57
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:50,716
Oh! Mr Waternoose!

58
00:03:50,807 --> 00:03:55,437
There is nothing more toxic
or deadly than a human child.

59
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,597
A single touch could kill you!

60
00:03:57,687 --> 00:03:59,564
Leave a door open

61
00:03:59,647 --> 00:04:02,445
and a child could walk
right into this factory!

62
00:04:02,527 --> 00:04:04,358
Right into the monster world!

63
00:04:04,447 --> 00:04:05,675
I won't go
in a kid's room!

64
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:06,643
You can't make me!

65
00:04:06,727 --> 00:04:09,560
You're going in there
because we need this.

66
00:04:09,647 --> 00:04:11,797
( children screaoing )

67
00:04:11,887 --> 00:04:13,605
( whiopering )

68
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:14,802
( static and feedback )

69
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:15,763
( screaoing stops )

70
00:04:15,847 --> 00:04:17,758
Our city is counting on you

71
00:04:17,847 --> 00:04:19,963
to collect
those children's screams.

72
00:04:20,047 --> 00:04:22,720
Without scream,
we have no power.

73
00:04:22,807 --> 00:04:24,638
Yes, it's dangerous work

74
00:04:24,727 --> 00:04:27,525
and that's why I need
you to be at your best.

75
00:04:27,607 --> 00:04:30,519
I need scarers
who are confident, tenacious

76
00:04:30,607 --> 00:04:33,280
tough, intimidating.

77
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:38,600
I need scarers like... like...
James P. Sullivan.

78
00:04:38,687 --> 00:04:41,565
( snoring )

79
00:04:41,647 --> 00:04:43,319
Hey! Good morning,
Monstropolis.

80
00:04:43,407 --> 00:04:45,557
It's now five after
the hour of 6:00 a.m.

81
00:04:45,647 --> 00:04:46,966
in the big monster city.

82
00:04:47,047 --> 00:04:48,639
Temperature's a
balmy 65 degrees--

83
00:04:48,727 --> 00:04:50,558
which is good news
for you reptiles--

84
00:04:50,647 --> 00:04:52,877
and it looks like it's
going to be a perfect day

85
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:54,878
to maybe, hey,
just lie in bed, sleep in

86
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:58,642
or simply... work out that flab
that's hanging over the bed!

87
00:04:58,727 --> 00:05:00,080
Get up, Sulley!

88
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:01,839
-( honking )
-( screaoing )

89
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:05,602
I don't believe I ordered
a wake-up call, Mikey.

90
00:05:05,687 --> 00:05:07,598
Hey! Less talk, more pain,
marshmallow boy!

91
00:05:07,687 --> 00:05:09,086
-( growling )
-Feel the burn!

92
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:10,441
You call yourself
a monster?

93
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,403
( growling )

94
00:05:11,487 --> 00:05:12,886
Scary feet, scary feet,
scary feet!

95
00:05:12,967 --> 00:05:14,002
Oop! The kid's awake!

96
00:05:14,087 --> 00:05:15,679
Okay, scary feet, scary feet,
scary feet, scary feet--

97
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:16,643
Kid's asleep!

98

( roaring )

99
00:05:17,687 --> 00:05:18,756
Twins! In a bunk bed!

100
00:05:18,847 --> 00:05:21,077
( growling )

101
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:22,395
Ooh! I thought I had you there.

102
00:05:22,487 --> 00:05:23,920
Okay, Sulley, here we go.

103
00:05:24,007 --> 00:05:25,156
You ready? Follow it.

104
00:05:25,247 --> 00:05:26,202
Oh! It's over here!

105
00:05:26,287 --> 00:05:27,356
Oh, look over there!

106
00:05:27,447 --> 00:05:28,721
Don't let the kid
touch you!

107
00:05:28,807 --> 00:05:29,796
Don't let it touch you!

108
00:05:29,887 --> 00:05:31,639
I don't know,
but it's been said

109
00:05:31,727 --> 00:05:33,160
I love scaring kids in bed!

110
00:05:33,247 --> 00:05:35,078
Come on, fight that plaque!
Fight that plaque!

111
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:36,395
Scary monsters
don't have plaque!

112
00:05:36,487 --> 00:05:38,717
1 1 8... do you have 1 1 9?

113
00:05:38,807 --> 00:05:40,206
Do I see 1 20?

114
00:05:40,287 --> 00:05:41,402
Oh, I don't believe it!

115
00:05:41,487 --> 00:05:42,840
I'm not even
breaking a sweat.

116
00:05:42,927 --> 00:05:43,803
Not you!

117
00:05:43,887 --> 00:05:45,036
Look! The new

the window of innocence
is shrinking.

136
00:06:16,967 --> 00:06:19,242
Human kids are harder to scare.

137
00:06:19,327 --> 00:06:21,841
Of course, M.I. is prepared
for the future

138
00:06:21,927 --> 00:06:22,996

I can't believe it.

149
00:06:44,927 --> 00:06:45,962
Oh, Mike...

150
00:06:46,047 --> 00:06:48,402
I was on TV!

151
00:06:48,487 --> 00:06:50,000
Did you see me?
I'm a natural!

152
00:06:50,087 --> 00:06:50,963
( phone rings )

153
00:06:51,047 --> 00:06:51,923
Hello.

154
00:06:52,007 --> 00:06:52,883
I know!

155
00:06:52,967 --> 00:06:53,843
Hey, wasn't I great?

156
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:55,042
Did the whole
family see it?

157
00:06:55,127 --> 00:06:56,162
It's your mom.

158
00:06:56,247 --> 00:06:58,363
What can I say?
The camera loves me.

159
00:07:08,527 --> 00:07:09,642
( bicycle bell rings )

160
00:07:09,727 --> 00:07:11,399
I'm telling you, big daddy

161
00:07:11,487 --> 00:07:13,796
you're going to be seeing
this face on TV a lot more often.

162
00:07:13,887 --> 00:07:15,684
~Yeah? Like, on
Monstropolis's Most Wanted?

163
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:16,882
( oocking laughter )

164
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:18,320
You've been jealous
of my good looks

165
00:07:18,407 --> 00:07:19,442
since the
fourth grade, pal.

166
00:07:19,527 --> 00:07:20,880
Have a good day, sweetie.

167
00:07:20,967 --> 00:07:23,083
You, too, hon.

168
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:24,998
Whoo!
Okay, Sulley, hop on in.

169
00:07:25,087 --> 00:07:26,076
Nope. Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

170
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:27,043
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

171
00:07:27,127 --> 00:07:28,321
Where you going?
What are you doing?

172
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:30,125
Mikey, there's a scream shortage.
We're walking.

173
00:07:30,207 --> 00:07:31,162
Walking?! Yep.

174
00:07:31,247 --> 00:07:32,123
No, no, no, my baby.

175
00:07:32,207 --> 00:07:33,083
Come on. Come on.

176
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:34,202
Look, she needs
to be driven.

177
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,676
Bye, baby.
I... I'll call you!

178
00:07:36,767 --> 00:07:38,405
MIKE:
Hey, genius,
you want to know why

179
00:07:38,487 --> 00:07:39,681
I bought the car? Huh?

180
00:07:39,767 --> 00:07:40,643
Not really.

181
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:41,682
To drive it!

182
00:07:41,767 --> 00:07:43,086
You know, like,
on the street?

183
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:44,395
With the honk-honk
and the vroom-vroom

184
00:07:44,487 --> 00:07:45,363
and no walking involved.

185
00:07:45,447 --> 00:07:46,323
( oock whining )

186
00:07:46,407 --> 00:07:47,760
Give it a rest,
will you, butterball?

187
00:07:47,847 --> 00:07:49,405
Come on, you could
use the exercise.

188
00:07:49,487 --> 00:07:50,715
I could use
the exercise?!

189
00:07:50,807 --> 00:07:52,843
Look at you.
You have your own climate!

190
00:07:52,927 --> 00:07:55,043
GIRL MONSTERS:
How many tentacles
jump the rope?

191
00:07:55,127 --> 00:07:56,606
BO Y MONSTER:
Morning, Mike!
Morning, Sulley!

192
00:07:56,687 --> 00:07:57,563
Hey! Morning, kids.

193
00:07:57,647 --> 00:07:58,523
Hey, kids.

194
00:07:58,607 --> 00:07:59,483
How you doing?

195
00:07:59,567 --> 00:08:01,125
Bye, Mike!
Bye, Sulley!

196
00:08:01,207 --> 00:08:02,879
BIG EYE:
Ow! Hey!

197
00:08:02,967 --> 00:08:04,844
( huooing )

198
00:08:07,527 --> 00:08:09,358
( sneezing )

199
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,926
Ah, nuts.

200
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,884
( singing )

201
00:08:12,967 --> 00:08:14,719
Hey, hey, hey! Fellas!

202
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:15,683
Hey, Tony!

203
00:08:15,767 --> 00:08:17,962
Tony! Ba-da-bing!

204
00:08:18,047 --> 00:08:18,923
-Hey, Tony!
-Tony!

205
00:08:19,007 --> 00:08:19,883
Pow, pow,
pow, pow, pow!

206
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,366
I hear somebody's
close to breaking

207
00:08:21,447 --> 00:08:22,323
the all-time
scare record.

208
00:08:22,407 --> 00:08:23,522
Ah, just trying
to make sure

209
00:08:23,607 --> 00:08:24,960
there's enough scream
to go around.

210
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:25,957
( laughing )

211
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,196
Hey! On the house!

212
00:08:27,287 --> 00:08:29,118
-Hey, thanks!
-Grazie!

213
00:08:29,207 --> 00:08:30,845
MIKE:
Ba-da-bing!

214
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,519
( startled gasp )

215
00:08:32,607 --> 00:08:34,404
Oh, great.

216
00:08:34,487 --> 00:08:35,442
Hey, Ted!

217
00:08:35,527 --> 00:08:36,960
Good morning!

218
00:08:37,047 --> 00:08:38,162
( clucking )

219
00:08:40,007 --> 00:08:41,201
See that, Mikey?

220
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:42,606
Ted's walking to work.

221
00:08:42,687 --> 00:08:43,836
Big deal.

222
00:08:43,927 --> 00:08:45,599
Guy takes five steps
and he's there.

223
00:08:51,407 --> 00:08:52,840
( phones ringing )

224
00:08:52,927 --> 00:08:54,485
FEMALE MONSTER:
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.

225
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,683
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.

226
00:08:56,767 --> 00:08:57,643
Morning, Sulley.

227
00:08:57,727 --> 00:08:58,603
Morning, Ricky.

228
00:08:58,687 --> 00:08:59,563
Hey, it's the Sullster!

229
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,682
See you on the scare floor,
buddy!

230
00:09:00,767 --> 00:09:01,836
Hey, Marge.
Hey, how was jury duty?

231
00:09:01,927 --> 00:09:03,485
Morning, Sulley!

232
00:09:03,567 --> 00:09:04,716
Hey!

233
00:09:05,767 --> 00:09:07,678
Hey, it's still
leaning to the left.

234
00:09:07,767 --> 00:09:08,756
It is not!

235
00:09:08,847 --> 00:09:09,723
Hey, fellas.

236
00:09:09,807 --> 00:09:10,683
Hey,Jerry.

237
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:12,041
Hey, Mr Sullivan!

238
00:09:12,127 --> 00:09:14,846
Guys, I told you,
call me Sulley.

239
00:09:14,927 --> 00:09:15,803
( nervous giggling )

240
00:09:15,887 --> 00:09:16,763
I don't think so.

241
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,644
We just wanted to wish
you good luck today.

242
00:09:18,727 --> 00:09:19,682
Hey. Hey, hey,
hey, hey!

243
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:20,916
Come on, get lost,
you two.

244
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:22,360
You're making him
lose his focus.

245
00:09:22,447 --> 00:09:23,323
Oh. Sorry.

246
00:09:23,407 --> 00:09:24,283
See you later,
fellas.

247
00:09:24,367 --> 00:09:26,085
Go get 'em,
Mr Sullivan!

248
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:29,079
Quiet! You'll make
him lose his focus.

249
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:30,043
Oh, no. Sorry!

250
00:09:30,127 --> 00:09:31,082
Shut up!

251
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:32,919
-( phones ringing )
-Monsters, Inc. Please hold.

252
00:09:33,007 --> 00:09:35,043
Monsters, Inc.
I'll connect you.

253
00:09:35,127 --> 00:09:36,242
Ms Fearmonger is on vacation.

254
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:37,442
Would you like her voice mail?

255
00:09:37,527 --> 00:09:40,121
Oh, Schmoopsie-poo.

256
00:09:40,207 --> 00:09:41,925
-( snakes squealing )
-Googley Bear!

257
00:09:42,007 --> 00:09:43,042
Happy birthday.

258
00:09:43,127 --> 00:09:45,595
Oh, Googley-woogley,
you remembered!

259
00:09:45,687 --> 00:09:46,836
Hey, Sulley-wulley.

260
00:09:46,927 --> 00:09:48,155
Oh, hey, Celia...

261
00:09:48,247 --> 00:09:49,202
weelia.

262
00:09:49,287 --> 00:09:50,879
( clears throat ):
Happy birthday.

263
00:09:50,967 --> 00:09:52,195
Thanks.

264
00:09:52,287 --> 00:09:55,085
So, uh... are we going
anywhere special tonight?

265
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:57,442
I just got us
into a little place

266
00:09:57,527 --> 00:09:59,404
called, um...
Harryhausen's.

267
00:09:59,487 --> 00:10:00,363
( gasps )

268
00:10:00,447 --> 00:10:01,516
Harryhausen's?!

269
00:10:01,607 --> 00:10:03,643
But it's impossible to
get a reservation there!

270
00:10:03,727 --> 00:10:05,604
Not for Googley Bear.

271
00:10:05,687 --> 00:10:07,200
I will see you
at quitting time

272
00:10:07,287 --> 00:10:08,481
and not a minute later.

273
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:09,522
Okay, sweetheart.

274
00:10:09,607 --> 00:10:10,881
Think romantical
thoughts.

275
00:10:10,967 --> 00:10:12,958
You and me

276
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:14,275
Me and you

277
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:16,597
Both of us together!

278
00:10:16,687 --> 00:10:18,917
You know, pal, she's the one.

279
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,235
That's it.
She is the one!

280
00:10:20,327 --> 00:10:21,760
I'm happy for you.

281
00:10:21,847 --> 00:10:23,405
Oh, and, uh,
thanks for hooking me up

282
00:10:23,487 --> 00:10:24,761
with those reservations.

283
00:10:24,847 --> 00:10:26,803
Oh, no problem.
They're under the
name Googley Bear.

284
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:27,763
Oh, good ide...

285
00:10:27,847 --> 00:10:29,917
You know,
that wasn't very funny.

286
00:10:30,007 --> 00:10:31,042
( gasps )

287
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:33,243
What the...?

288
00:10:33,327 --> 00:10:34,203
Wazowski!

289
00:10:34,287 --> 00:10:35,163
( screaos )

290
00:10:35,247 --> 00:10:36,396
( grunts )

291
00:10:36,487 --> 00:10:37,317
( chuckling )

292
00:10:37,407 --> 00:10:38,476
What do you know?

293
00:10:38,567 --> 00:10:41,286
It scares little kids
and little monsters.

294
00:10:41,367 --> 00:10:42,277
I wasn't scared.

295
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:44,597
I have... allergies.

296
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:45,597
( coughing )

297
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,166
Uh-huh. Sure.

298
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:49,044
Hey, Randall, save it for
the scare floor, will you?

299
00:10:49,127 --> 00:10:50,560
I'm in the zone today,
Sullivan.

300
00:10:50,647 --> 00:10:52,444
Going to be doing
some serious scaring.

301
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:53,960
Putting up some big numbers.

302
00:10:54,047 --> 00:10:55,082
Wow, Randall.

303
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:56,202
That's great.

304
00:10:56,287 --> 00:10:57,800
That should make it
even more humiliating

305
00:10:57,887 --> 00:10:59,081
when we break the record first.

306
00:10:59,167 --> 00:10:59,644
Ha, ha!

307
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:01,160
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh.

308
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,475
Do you hear that?

309
00:11:02,567 --> 00:11:05,400
It's the winds of change.

310
00:11:06,607 --> 00:11:09,246
( oocking voice ):
''You hear it?
You hear the winds of ch...?''

311
00:11:09,327 --> 00:11:10,521
Oh, what a creep.

312
00:11:10,607 --> 00:11:12,723
One of these days,
I am really...

313
00:11:12,807 --> 00:11:15,116
going to let you
teach that guy a lesson.

314
00:11:17,407 --> 00:11:18,681
( deep croaking )

315
00:11:18,767 --> 00:11:20,041
( liquid squishing )

316
00:11:21,767 --> 00:11:24,076
Chalooby! Baby!

317
00:11:25,287 --> 00:11:26,720
MIKE:
Good morning, Roz

318
00:11:26,807 --> 00:11:28,638
my succulent
little garden snail.

319
00:11:28,727 --> 00:11:30,160
And who would
we be scaring today?

320
00:11:30,247 --> 00:11:34,320
Wazowski, you didn't file
your paperwork last night.

321
00:11:34,407 --> 00:11:35,999
Oh, that darn paperwork.

322
00:11:36,087 --> 00:11:39,523
Wouldn't it be easier
if it all just blew away?

323
00:11:39,607 --> 00:11:40,562
( chair squeaking )

324
00:11:40,647 --> 00:11:42,922
Don't let it happen again.

325
00:11:43,007 --> 00:11:44,440
Yes, well, I'll, uh...

326
00:11:44,527 --> 00:11:46,757
I'll try to be less careless.

327
00:11:46,847 --> 00:11:49,077
I'm watching you, Wazowski.

328
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,044
Always watching.

329
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,082
Whoo! She's nuts.

330
00:11:52,167 --> 00:11:53,919
Always!

331
00:11:54,007 --> 00:11:57,079
CELIA ( over P.A. ):
All scare floors are now active.

332
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:59,806
Assistants, please report
to your stations.

333
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:01,081
( oetallic clunk )

334
00:12:08,887 --> 00:12:11,117
( oachine beeps, bell dings )

335
00:12:17,207 --> 00:12:18,799
( bell dings )

336
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:38,486
( clanking and whirring )

337
00:12:42,687 --> 00:12:43,881
( chioe rings )

338
00:12:43,967 --> 00:12:47,437
Okay, people,
eastern seaboard coming on-line.

339
00:12:47,527 --> 00:12:49,404
We got scarers coming out!

340
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:55,682
( draoatic brass fanfare
~ playing )

341
00:13:02,807 --> 00:13:05,560
Ooh, they're
so awesome.

342
00:13:24,127 --> 00:13:26,038
( knuckles cracking )

343
00:13:26,127 --> 00:13:27,879
( clanging and growling )

344
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:30,156
( snarls )

345
00:13:33,967 --> 00:13:34,922
( blowing )

346
00:13:35,007 --> 00:13:36,156
( growling )

347
00:13:49,927 --> 00:13:52,725
Hey... may
the best monster win.

348
00:13:52,807 --> 00:13:54,035
I plan to.

349
00:13:54,127 --> 00:13:55,162
( bell ringing )

350
00:13:55,247 --> 00:13:57,841
We are on in seven... six...

351
00:13:57,927 --> 00:14:01,556
five... four... three...

352
00:14:01,647 --> 00:14:03,558
two...

353
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:06,002
( horn blaring )

354
00:14:06,087 --> 00:14:06,883
( growls )

355
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:09,361
You're the boss.
You're the boss.

356
00:14:09,447 --> 00:14:10,516
You're the big,
hairy boss.

357
00:14:15,247 --> 00:14:16,475
( child screaoing )

358
00:14:18,047 --> 00:14:19,082
( bell dings )

359
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:21,362
Oh, I'm feeling
good today, Mikey!

360
00:14:21,447 --> 00:14:22,323
Yeah!

361
00:14:22,407 --> 00:14:23,522
MIKE:
Whoa!

362
00:14:23,607 --> 00:14:24,801
Attaboy.
Attaboy.

363
00:14:24,887 --> 00:14:26,115
Another door coming right up.

364
00:14:26,207 --> 00:14:28,767
( whirring and clanking )

365
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:29,962
( child screaoing )

366
00:14:30,047 --> 00:14:31,082
( bell dings )

367
00:14:32,847 --> 00:14:33,723
( growling )

368
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:35,081
You're still behind,
Randall.

369
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:37,123
You know, maybe I should
realign the scream intake valve.

370
00:14:37,207 --> 00:14:38,037
Just get me
another door!

371
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,242
A door! Yes, door!

372
00:14:39,327 --> 00:14:41,682
( child screaoing )

373
00:14:41,767 --> 00:14:43,359
( bell dings )

374
00:14:43,447 --> 00:14:44,641
( bells dinging )

375
00:14:46,487 --> 00:14:48,637
( beeping )

376
00:14:48,727 --> 00:14:49,443
( oetallic clanking )

377
00:14:49,527 --> 00:14:50,357
( click and hiss )

378
00:14:50,447 --> 00:14:52,881
( children screaoing )

379
00:14:52,967 --> 00:14:55,117
( bells dinging )

380
00:14:55,207 --> 00:14:57,516
( children screaoing )

381
00:15:03,847 --> 00:15:06,077
Well,Jerry, what's
the damage so far?

382
00:15:06,167 --> 00:15:08,635
We may actually
make our quota today, sir.

383
00:15:08,727 --> 00:15:11,525
Hmm. First time
in a month.

384
00:15:11,607 --> 00:15:13,563
( gurgling and burping )

385
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:15,080
Huh?!

386
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:16,316
( door buzzing )

387
00:15:16,407 --> 00:15:18,238
( screaoing and sobbing )

388
00:15:18,327 --> 00:15:19,680
What happened?

389
00:15:19,767 --> 00:15:20,836
The kid almost
touched me!

390
00:15:20,927 --> 00:15:22,121
She got this close
to me!

391
00:15:22,207 --> 00:15:23,481
She wasn't
scared of you?

392
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:24,602
She was only six!

393
00:15:24,687 --> 00:15:25,961
I could've been dead!

394
00:15:26,047 --> 00:15:27,878
I could've died!

395
00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:30,003
Keep it together, man.

396
00:15:30,087 --> 00:15:31,076
( whistling )

397
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:32,646
Hey! We got a dead
door over here!

398
00:15:32,727 --> 00:15:34,001
-We're coming!
-Coming!

399
00:15:34,087 --> 00:15:35,679
-Look out!
-Out of the way!

400
00:15:35,767 --> 00:15:37,564
-Coming through!
-Excuse us.

401
00:15:37,647 --> 00:15:40,036
( whiopering )

402
00:15:40,127 --> 00:15:42,595
We've lost 58 doors
this week, sir.

403
00:15:42,687 --> 00:15:44,518
Oh, kids these days.

404
00:15:44,607 --> 00:15:46,916
They just don't get
scared like they used to.

405
00:15:47,007 --> 00:15:48,918
Let her rip!

406
00:15:49,007 --> 00:15:51,726
( buzzing )

407
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:55,837
( oetallic clank )

408
00:15:55,927 --> 00:15:58,395
( eerie blubbering )

409
00:15:58,487 --> 00:15:59,363
( child screaoing )

410
00:15:59,447 --> 00:16:00,323
( bell dings )

411
00:16:00,407 --> 00:16:01,283
Uh, sir?

412
00:16:01,367 --> 00:16:02,243
What?!

413
00:16:02,327 --> 00:16:03,726
Look.

414
00:16:03,807 --> 00:16:05,877
CELIA ( over P.A. ):
Attention.

415
00:16:05,967 --> 00:16:07,878
We have a new scare leader:
Randall Boggs.

416
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,036
( snickering )

417
00:16:09,127 --> 00:16:11,561
( assistants cheering )

418
00:16:11,647 --> 00:16:14,525
( children screaoing )

419
00:16:16,367 --> 00:16:17,482
( knuckles cracking )

420
00:16:17,567 --> 00:16:18,397
Slumber party.

421
00:16:18,487 --> 00:16:19,363
( laughing )

422
00:16:19,447 --> 00:16:20,402
Whoo!

423
00:16:20,487 --> 00:16:22,000
( beeping )

424
00:16:22,087 --> 00:16:23,566
CELIA ( over P.A. ):
Never mind.

425
00:16:23,647 --> 00:16:25,285
Hey! Watch it!

426
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:27,597
( Sulley laughing )

427
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:30,406
Well,James, that was
an impressive display!

428
00:16:30,487 --> 00:16:32,364
Oh, just doing my job,
Mr Waternoose.

429
00:16:32,447 --> 00:16:34,358
Of course, I did
learn from the best.

430
00:16:34,447 --> 00:16:35,562
( both laughing )

431
00:16:35,647 --> 00:16:38,764
If I don't see a new door at
my station in five seconds

432
00:16:38,847 --> 00:16:41,520
I will personally
put you through the shredder!

433
00:16:41,607 --> 00:16:42,357
( screaos )

434
00:16:42,591 --> 00:16:45,185
Hey, Wazowski, nice job!

435
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:46,704
Those numbers
are pretty sweet.

436
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:47,985
Are they?

437
00:16:48,071 --> 00:16:49,424
You know,
I hadn't even noticed.

438
00:16:49,511 --> 00:16:50,864
And, uh...
how is Georgie doing?

439
00:16:50,951 --> 00:16:52,020
He's doing great!

440
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,385
I love working
with that big guy.

441
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:54,381
( child screaoing )

442
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,506
Keep the doors coming,
Charlie.

443
00:16:55,591 --> 00:16:56,626
I'm on a roll today.

444
00:16:56,711 --> 00:16:58,349
George and I
are like brothers.

445
00:16:58,431 --> 00:16:59,307
( gasping )

446
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,905
231 9!

447
00:17:01,991 --> 00:17:03,902
( gasping )

448
00:17:06,031 --> 00:17:07,350
( alaro blaring )

449
00:17:07,431 --> 00:17:09,547
COMPUTER VOICE ( over P.A. ):
Red alert! Red alert!

450
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,950
Red alert! Red alert! Red alert!

451
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,464
FEMALE ( over P.A. ):
George Sanderson

452
00:17:12,551 --> 00:17:14,143
please remain motionless.

453
00:17:14,231 --> 00:17:15,380
Prepare for decontamination.

454
00:17:15,471 --> 00:17:16,620
Get it off!

455
00:17:16,711 --> 00:17:18,303
JERRY:
Duck and cover, people!

456
00:17:20,871 --> 00:17:23,260
Oh, not the CD A.

457
00:17:26,391 --> 00:17:28,302
( siren wailing )

458
00:17:31,031 --> 00:17:31,986
CD A AGENT:
Move! Move! Move!

459
00:17:32,071 --> 00:17:33,550
Coming through, please.
Stand aside.

460
00:17:33,631 --> 00:17:34,700
CD A AGENT 2:
Clear the contaminated area.

461
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:35,780
( screaos )

462
00:17:35,871 --> 00:17:37,509
CD A AGENT:
This is a 231 9 in progress.

463
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:38,467
Keep the area clear.

464
00:17:38,551 --> 00:17:39,620
Coming through.
Watch yourself.

465
00:17:39,711 --> 00:17:40,746
( grunts )

466
00:17:40,831 --> 00:17:42,150
( whiopering )

467
00:17:43,591 --> 00:17:44,865
Stand back.

468
00:17:44,951 --> 00:17:46,748
Careful.

469
00:17:46,831 --> 00:17:48,105
( oetallic clang )

470
00:17:48,191 --> 00:17:49,385
( drills whirring )

471
00:17:53,671 --> 00:17:54,421
( all gasping )

472
00:17:54,511 --> 00:17:56,547
( ouffled explosion )

473
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,941
( drills whirring )

474
00:18:00,031 --> 00:18:01,225
All clear.

475
00:18:01,311 --> 00:18:02,824
Situation is niner-niner-zero.

476
00:18:02,911 --> 00:18:04,344
Ready for decon.

477
00:18:04,431 --> 00:18:05,466
Hey, thanks, guys.

478
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:06,620
That was a close one.

479
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:08,064
Okay.

480
00:18:08,151 --> 00:18:09,982
( shears buzzing )

481
00:18:10,071 --> 00:18:11,629
( screaoing )

482
00:18:11,711 --> 00:18:13,542
( whiopering )

483
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,462
( ripping )

484
00:18:15,551 --> 00:18:17,507
( screaoing )

485
00:18:17,591 --> 00:18:20,059
JERRY:
Okay, people, take a break!

486
00:18:20,151 --> 00:18:21,425
We got to shut down
for a half-hour

487
00:18:21,511 --> 00:18:22,500
and reset the system.

488
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:25,025
An entire scare floor
out of commission.

489
00:18:25,111 --> 00:18:26,783
What else can go wrong?

490
00:18:28,311 --> 00:18:30,620
Oh... what a day.

491
00:18:30,711 --> 00:18:32,383
We're just going through
a rough time, sir.

492
00:18:32,471 --> 00:18:34,507
Everyone knows you're going
to get us through it.

493
00:18:34,591 --> 00:18:36,388
Tell that to the
board of directors.

494
00:18:36,471 --> 00:18:37,904
( slurping )

495
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,504
James, this company

496
00:18:39,591 --> 00:18:42,230
has been in my family
for three generations.

497
00:18:42,311 --> 00:18:45,269
I would do anything to
keep it from going under.

498
00:18:45,351 --> 00:18:46,545
Oh, so would I, sir.

499
00:18:46,631 --> 00:18:47,984
Well...

500
00:18:48,071 --> 00:18:50,665
Say, I could use your help
with something.

501
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,150
Anything, sir.

502
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:54,222
You see, we've hired
some new scare recruits

503
00:18:54,311 --> 00:18:56,142
and frankly, they're...
they're, um... uh...

504
00:18:56,231 --> 00:18:57,664
Inexperienced?

505
00:18:57,751 --> 00:18:59,150
Oh, they stink!

506
00:18:59,231 --> 00:19:00,425
Uh-huh.

507
00:19:00,511 --> 00:19:02,308
And I thought maybe
you might come by tomorrow

508
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,824
and give them a demonstration.

509
00:19:03,911 --> 00:19:06,869
Show them what it takes
to be a top scarer, huh?

510
00:19:06,951 --> 00:19:09,909
I'll start out with the old
Waternoose jump-and-growl.

511
00:19:09,991 --> 00:19:11,504
( growling loudly )

512
00:19:11,591 --> 00:19:13,388
Ha! Oh, oh, yes!

513
00:19:13,471 --> 00:19:14,745
Now, that's my boy!

514
00:19:14,831 --> 00:19:16,059
( both laughing )

515
00:19:17,671 --> 00:19:19,980
( ringing )

516
00:19:21,391 --> 00:19:22,949
JERRY:
Let's go, everybody!

517
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:24,305
All doors must be returned!

518
00:19:24,391 --> 00:19:25,983
No exceptions!

519
00:19:30,511 --> 00:19:31,500
-Whoo!
-Oh, yeah.

520
00:19:31,591 --> 00:19:33,343
I've never seen anything
like you today.

521
00:19:33,431 --> 00:19:34,659
You were on
a roll, my man.

522
00:19:34,751 --> 00:19:35,627
Another day like this

523
00:19:35,711 --> 00:19:36,826
and that scare record's
in the bag.

524
00:19:36,911 --> 00:19:37,866
That's right, baby!

525
00:19:37,951 --> 00:19:38,940
Uh-huh.

526
00:19:42,831 --> 00:19:44,310
So get this--
as if dinner wasn't enough

527
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,382
I'm taking her to
a monster truck rally afterwards.

528
00:19:46,471 --> 00:19:47,347
Nice.

529
00:19:47,431 --> 00:19:48,625
What's on your agenda?

530
00:19:48,711 --> 00:19:50,224
I'm going to head home
and work out some more.

531
00:19:50,311 --> 00:19:52,222
Again? You know, there's
more to life than scaring.

532
00:19:52,311 --> 00:19:53,266
( sniffing )

533
00:19:53,351 --> 00:19:54,625
Whew. Hey, can I
borrow your odorant?

534
00:19:54,711 --> 00:19:56,064
Yeah. I got, uh...

535
00:19:56,151 --> 00:19:58,904
smelly garbage or old dumpster.

536
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:00,106
You got low tide?

537
00:20:00,191 --> 00:20:01,067
No.

538
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,027
How about wet dog?

539
00:20:02,111 --> 00:20:03,066
Yep. Stink it up.

540
00:20:04,551 --> 00:20:05,427
( growling )

541
00:20:05,511 --> 00:20:06,739
You know, I am so romantic

542
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,389
sometimes I think
I should just marry myself.

543
00:20:08,471 --> 00:20:09,699
Give me a break,
Mike.

544
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,225
What a night of romance
I got ahead of me.

545
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:13,460
Tonight is about me

546
00:20:13,551 --> 00:20:15,223
and Celia.

547
00:20:15,311 --> 00:20:17,825
Ooh, the love boat
is about to set sail.

548
00:20:17,911 --> 00:20:18,741
( ioitating ship horn )

549
00:20:18,831 --> 00:20:19,946
'Cause I got
to tell you, buddy

550
00:20:20,031 --> 00:20:22,067
that face of hers,
it just makes my heart go...

551
00:20:22,151 --> 00:20:23,027
Yikes!

552
00:20:23,111 --> 00:20:24,180
Hello, Wazowski.

553
00:20:24,271 --> 00:20:26,944
Fun-filled evening
planned for tonight?

554
00:20:27,031 --> 00:20:28,703
Well, as a
matter of fact...

555
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:31,146
Then I'm sure you
filed your paperwork

556
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,222
correctly... for once.

557
00:20:34,351 --> 00:20:37,866
Your stunned silence
is very reassuring.

558
00:20:37,951 --> 00:20:39,782
Oh, no. My scare reports--
I left them on my desk

559
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:41,748
and if I'm not at
the restaurant in five minutes

560
00:20:41,831 --> 00:20:42,900
they're going to give
our table away!

561
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:43,867
What am I going to tell...

562
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:44,827
Schmoopsie-poo.

563
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:46,344
Hey, Googley Bear.
Want to get going?

564
00:20:46,431 --> 00:20:47,466
Do I ever!
It's just that...

565
00:20:47,551 --> 00:20:48,586
What?

566
00:20:48,671 --> 00:20:49,581
Uh, you know,
there's a small....

567
00:20:49,671 --> 00:20:50,865
I don't understand.

568
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:52,589
It's just that I forgot
about some paperwork

569
00:20:52,671 --> 00:20:53,740
I was supposed to file.

570
00:20:53,831 --> 00:20:55,310
Mike was reminding me.

571
00:20:55,391 --> 00:20:56,346
Thanks, buddy.

572
00:20:56,431 --> 00:20:57,466
Whoo.

573
00:20:57,551 --> 00:20:58,904
I was? I mean, I was!
Yeah, I was.

574
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,185
Oh, okay.
Let's go then.

575
00:21:00,271 --> 00:21:01,147
We're going!

576
00:21:01,231 --> 00:21:02,107
On my desk, Sulley.

577
00:21:02,191 --> 00:21:03,385
The pink copies
go to Accounting

578
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:04,699
the fuchsia ones
go to Purchasing

579
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:05,906
and goldenrod ones
go to Roz.

580
00:21:05,991 --> 00:21:06,867
Huh!

581
00:21:06,951 --> 00:21:07,986
Leave the puce.

582
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,589
SULLEY:
Pink copies go to Accounting,
the fuchsia ones go to Roz.

583
00:21:13,671 --> 00:21:15,662
No, fuchsia ones
go to Purchasing.

584
00:21:15,751 --> 00:21:17,503
The goldenrod ones go to Roz.

585
00:21:17,591 --> 00:21:20,185
Man, I have no idea
what puce is.

586
00:21:23,191 --> 00:21:25,182
Oh, that's puce.

587
00:21:25,271 --> 00:21:28,502
Hmm?

588
00:21:28,591 --> 00:21:31,264
Uh, hello?

589
00:21:31,351 --> 00:21:33,467
Anyone?

590
00:21:33,551 --> 00:21:35,701
There's a door here.

591
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:36,746
Hmm.

592
00:21:48,711 --> 00:21:50,781

593
00:21:50,871 --> 00:21:52,350

00:21:54,591 --> 00:21:55,467
( whispering ):
Hello?

595
00:21:55,551 --> 00:21:56,427
Hey.

596
00:21:56,511 --> 00:21:57,387
Psst.

597
00:21:57,471 --> 00:21:59,063
Anybody scaring in here?

598
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,982
Hello?

599
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:02,026
Yo!

600
00:22:08,351 --> 00:22:10,307
Hmm.

601
00:22:10,391 --> 00:22:11,346

Oh!

608

609
00:22:27,111 --> 00:22:28,180
Gotcha!

610

611
00:22:31,111 --> 00:22:32,066
( squeals in delight )

612
00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:33,106
Eh!

613

Oh!

621
00:22:45,671 --> 00:22:47,468
( loud crashing, toy squeaking )

622
00:22:48,591 --> 00:22:49,865
Yeow!

623
00:22:50,951 --> 00:22:51,906

( speaking baby talk )

640
00:23:51,551 --> 00:23:52,461
No, no-- stay back.

( speaking baby talk )

642
00:23:55,631 --> 00:23:56,700

Get a paper bag!

( laughing )

660
00:25:04,071 --> 00:25:06,426
Oh, Michael, I've had
a lot of birthday...

661
00:25:06,511 --> 00:25:08,024
well, not a
lot of birthdays

662
00:25:08,111 --> 00:25:10,102
but this is the
best birthday ever.

663
00:25:10,191 --> 00:25:11,067
Hmm.

664
00:25:11,151 --> 00:25:13,187
What are you
looking at?

665
00:25:13,271 --> 00:25:14,260
I was just thinking

666
00:25:14,351 --> 00:25:16,182
about the first time
I laid eye on you--

667
00:25:16,271 --> 00:25:17,226
how pretty you looked.

668
00:25:17,311 --> 00:25:18,346
Stop it!

669
00:25:18,431 --> 00:25:19,580
Your hair was
shorter then.

670
00:25:19,671 --> 00:25:21,070
Mm-hmm. I'm thinking
about getting it cut.

671
00:25:21,151 --> 00:25:22,027
( faint squeal of fear )

672
00:25:22,111 --> 00:25:23,180
No, no, I like
it this length.

673
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:24,147
( sighs of relief )

674
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,630
I like everything
about you.

675
00:25:25,711 --> 00:25:26,621
Just the other day

676
00:25:26,711 --> 00:25:28,030
someone asked me
who I thought

677
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:29,908
the most beautiful monster was
in all of Monstropolis.

678
00:25:29,991 --> 00:25:30,867
You know what I said?

679
00:25:30,951 --> 00:25:32,225
What did you say?

680
00:25:32,311 --> 00:25:33,187
I said...

681
00:25:33,271 --> 00:25:34,306
Sulley?

682
00:25:34,391 --> 00:25:35,619
Sulley?

683
00:25:35,711 --> 00:25:36,666
No! No, no.

684
00:25:36,751 --> 00:25:37,979
That's not
what I was going to say.

685
00:25:38,071 --> 00:25:39,424
Mike, you're not making sense.

686
00:25:39,511 --> 00:25:41,103
SULLEY:
Hi, guys!

687
00:25:41,191 --> 00:25:42,510
What a coincidence,
running into you here!

688
00:25:42,591 --> 00:25:44,024
Uh, I'm just going
to order something to go.

689
00:25:44,111 --> 00:25:44,987
Michael...

690
00:25:45,071 --> 00:25:45,947
Sulley!

691
00:25:46,031 --> 00:25:47,066
I wonder what's good here.

692
00:25:47,151 --> 00:25:48,504
Get out of here.
You're ruining everything.

693
00:25:48,591 --> 00:25:49,626
I went back to get
your paperwork

694
00:25:49,711 --> 00:25:50,587
and there was a door.

695
00:25:50,671 --> 00:25:51,626
What?

696
00:25:52,991 --> 00:25:54,504
( rattling )

697
00:25:54,591 --> 00:25:55,467
A door?!

698
00:25:55,551 --> 00:25:56,427
Randall was in it.

699
00:25:56,511 --> 00:25:57,421
Wait a minute.
Randall?

700
00:25:57,511 --> 00:25:58,421
That cheater!

701
00:25:58,511 --> 00:26:00,183
He's trying
to boost his numbers!

702
00:26:00,271 --> 00:26:01,499
There's something else.

703
00:26:01,591 --> 00:26:02,467
What?!

704
00:26:02,551 --> 00:26:03,666
Ook-lay in the ag-bay.

705
00:26:03,751 --> 00:26:04,627
What?!

706
00:26:04,711 --> 00:26:05,780
Look in the bag.

707
00:26:05,871 --> 00:26:07,509
What bag?

708
00:26:07,591 --> 00:26:09,707
( sighs )

709
00:26:10,751 --> 00:26:12,469
( gasps )

710
00:26:12,551 --> 00:26:14,143
( giggling )

711
00:26:14,231 --> 00:26:15,346
Oh!

712
00:26:15,431 --> 00:26:16,500
They don't have
anything I like here.

713
00:26:16,591 --> 00:26:17,546
So take care, Celia!

714
00:26:17,631 --> 00:26:18,461
Excuse me, sir.

715
00:26:18,551 --> 00:26:19,427
What's going on?

716
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:20,944
Celia, please try
to understand.

717
00:26:22,191 --> 00:26:23,704
I have to do something!

718
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:24,667
Michael?

719
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:26,230

On three.

720
00:26:26,311 --> 00:26:27,426

A kid!

727

There's a kid here--
a human kid!

00:26:41,671 --> 00:26:43,184
( exclaioing in baby talk )

729
00:26:43,271 --> 00:26:45,068

CD A HELICOPTER PILOT:
Please remain calm.

737
00:27:01,791 --> 00:27:02,826
This is not a drill.

738
00:27:02,911 --> 00:27:04,629
( siren wailing,
~ tyres screeching )

739
00:27:04,711 --> 00:27:06,588
CD A AGENT:
We have an 835 in progress.

740
00:27:06,671 --> 00:27:07,501
Please advise.

741
00:27:07,591 --> 00:27:09,786
Michael? Michael?

742
00:27:09,871 --> 00:27:10,860
Oh, Celia.

743
00:27:10,951 --> 00:27:12,430
-Please come with me.
-Ow. Stop pushing.

744
00:27:12,511 --> 00:27:14,308
Hey, get your hands off
my Schmoopsie-poo!

745
00:27:14,391 --> 00:27:16,586
Building clear.
Ready for decontamination.

746
00:27:16,671 --> 00:27:19,504
Well, I don't think that date
could have gone any worse.

747
00:27:19,591 --> 00:27:20,546
( explosion )

748
00:27:20,631 --> 00:27:22,269
( electrical buzzing )

749
00:27:26,071 --> 00:27:27,823
If witnesses are to be believed

750
00:27:27,911 --> 00:27:29,947
there has been
a child security breach

751
00:27:30,031 --> 00:27:32,181
for the first time
in monster history.

752
00:27:32,271 --> 00:27:33,590
We can neither confirm nor deny

753
00:27:33,671 --> 00:27:35,662
the presence of
a human child here tonight.

754
00:27:35,751 --> 00:27:37,389
Well, a kid flew right over me

755
00:27:37,471 --> 00:27:39,621
and blasted a car
with its laser vision!

756
00:27:39,711 --> 00:27:41,861
I tried to run from it,
but it picked me up

757
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:44,340
with its mind powers
and shook me like a doll!

758
00:27:44,431 --> 00:27:46,228
It's true!
I saw the whole thing!

759
00:27:46,311 --> 00:27:48,779
It is my
professional opinion

760
00:27:48,871 --> 00:27:51,669
that now is the time
to... panic!

761
00:27:51,751 --> 00:27:52,945
Oh-oh.

762
00:27:53,031 --> 00:27:55,022
( both yelling )

763
00:27:55,111 --> 00:27:56,226
Oh, it's coming!

764
00:27:56,311 --> 00:27:57,460
It's coming!

765
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:59,303
( giggling ):
Boo!

766
00:27:59,391 --> 00:28:00,506
( both screaoing )

767
00:28:00,591 --> 00:28:02,422
( distant sirens wailing )

768
00:28:03,471 --> 00:28:04,984
( delighted cry )

769
00:28:05,071 --> 00:28:06,709
( yelling )

770
00:28:06,791 --> 00:28:08,190
No, no, no, no, no!

771
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:09,386
Come here, kid.

772
00:28:09,471 --> 00:28:10,426
Whee.

773
00:28:12,551 --> 00:28:13,950
No, don't touch those,
you little...!

774
00:28:14,031 --> 00:28:14,907
Oh, now

775
00:28:14,991 --> 00:28:16,026
those were alphabetized.

776
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,100
It's okay, it's all right.

777
00:28:17,191 --> 00:28:18,385
As long as it doesn't
come near us

778
00:28:18,471 --> 00:28:19,347
we're going to be okay.

779
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:20,307
( sneezes )

780
00:28:20,391 --> 00:28:21,540
( screaos )

781
00:28:22,271 --> 00:28:23,499
( yelling in pain )

782
00:28:23,591 --> 00:28:24,819
( whiopering in fear )

783
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,026
Wanna ride on it!

784
00:28:27,511 --> 00:28:28,148
Da, da-da.

785
00:28:28,231 --> 00:28:29,107
Da-da-da.

786
00:28:29,191 --> 00:28:30,226
Oh, y-you like this?

787
00:28:30,311 --> 00:28:31,141
Fetch!

788
00:28:31,231 --> 00:28:32,107
( giggles )

789
00:28:32,191 --> 00:28:33,670
( gasps )

790
00:28:33,751 --> 00:28:35,070
Hey, hey, that's it!

791
00:28:35,151 --> 00:28:36,982
No one touches
little Mikey!

792
00:28:37,071 --> 00:28:38,789
( whining )

793
00:28:38,871 --> 00:28:40,748
Mike, give her the bear.

794
00:28:42,391 --> 00:28:43,267
Oh, no.

795
00:28:43,351 --> 00:28:45,103
( piercing screao )

796
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:46,544
( electrical buzzing )

797
00:28:48,191 --> 00:28:50,944
( screaoing and crying
~ continue )

798
00:28:51,031 --> 00:28:53,909
( buzzing continues )

799
00:28:56,191 --> 00:28:57,101
( exclaioing in fear )

800
00:28:57,191 --> 00:28:58,385
Make it stop, Sulley!

801
00:28:58,471 --> 00:28:59,540
Make it stop!

802
00:28:59,631 --> 00:29:00,780
Look!
See the bear?

803
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:01,860
Ooh, nice bear.

804
00:29:01,951 --> 00:29:02,986
( screaos )

805
00:29:03,071 --> 00:29:04,106
Sulley!

806
00:29:04,191 --> 00:29:05,180
See?

807
00:29:05,271 --> 00:29:06,260
Ooh, bear, ooh.

808
00:29:06,351 --> 00:29:08,023
Oh, he's
a happy bear.

809
00:29:08,111 --> 00:29:09,624
He's not crying,
neither should you

810
00:29:09,711 --> 00:29:10,985
Or we'll be in trouble

811
00:29:11,071 --> 00:29:12,060
'Cause they're gonna find us

812
00:29:12,151 --> 00:29:14,142
So please stop crying

813
00:29:14,231 --> 00:29:15,266
Right now.

814
00:29:15,351 --> 00:29:16,340
Good, good, Sulley.
Keep it up.

815
00:29:16,431 --> 00:29:17,625
You're doing great.

816
00:29:17,711 --> 00:29:18,860
Ooh, the happy bear,
he has no...

817
00:29:18,951 --> 00:29:20,100
( screaoing )

818
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:21,419
She touched me!

819
00:29:21,511 --> 00:29:22,421
Sulley, the bear!

820
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:23,387
The bear!

821
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:24,381
Give her the...

822
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:25,950
Whoa!

823
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:29,744
( giggles )

824
00:29:29,831 --> 00:29:31,059
( screaoing with laughter )

825
00:29:31,151 --> 00:29:32,903
( electrical buzzing
~ grows louder )

826
00:29:32,991 --> 00:29:33,946
( light bulb shatters )

827
00:29:34,031 --> 00:29:34,941
( giggles )

828
00:29:35,031 --> 00:29:36,589
What was that?

829
00:29:36,671 --> 00:29:37,581
( thuoping )

830
00:29:37,671 --> 00:29:38,547
I have no idea

831
00:29:38,631 --> 00:29:40,349
but it would be
really great

832
00:29:40,431 --> 00:29:41,864
if it didn't
do it again.

833
00:29:41,951 --> 00:29:43,066
( giggles )

834
00:29:43,151 --> 00:29:44,425
Shh, shh, shh.

835
00:29:44,511 --> 00:29:45,580
Shh...

836
00:29:45,671 --> 00:29:46,786
Shh.

837
00:29:46,871 --> 00:29:48,463
Shh...

838
00:29:57,071 --> 00:29:58,299
Ah!

839
00:30:01,671 --> 00:30:02,740
How could I do this?

840
00:30:02,831 --> 00:30:04,264
How could I be so stupid?

841
00:30:04,351 --> 00:30:05,830
This could destroy
the company.

842
00:30:05,911 --> 00:30:06,787
The company?

843
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:08,190
Who cares
about the company?!

844
00:30:08,271 --> 00:30:09,147
What about us?

845
00:30:09,231 --> 00:30:10,664
That thing is
a killing machine!

846
00:30:10,751 --> 00:30:12,787
La-la-la-la-la-la

847
00:30:12,871 --> 00:30:14,668
I bet it's just waiting
for us to fall asleep

848
00:30:14,751 --> 00:30:15,786
and then wham!

849
00:30:15,871 --> 00:30:17,543
Oh, we're easy prey,
my friend-- easy prey.

850
00:30:17,631 --> 00:30:19,428
We're sitting targets.

851
00:30:19,511 --> 00:30:20,341
Okay, look, I think

852
00:30:20,431 --> 00:30:21,705
I have a plan here.

853
00:30:21,791 --> 00:30:24,863
Using mainly spoons, we dig
a tunnel under the city

854
00:30:24,951 --> 00:30:26,748
and release it into the wild.

855
00:30:26,831 --> 00:30:28,822
Spoons.

856
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:30,264
That's it, I'm out of ideas.

857
00:30:30,351 --> 00:30:31,704
We're closed.
Hot air balloon?

858
00:30:31,791 --> 00:30:33,383
Too expensive.
Giant slingshot?

859
00:30:33,471 --> 00:30:34,347
Too conspicuous.

860
00:30:34,431 --> 00:30:35,466
Enormous wooden horse?
Too Greek!

861
00:30:35,551 --> 00:30:38,623
( speaking baby talk )

862
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:40,667
No plan. No plan.

863
00:30:40,751 --> 00:30:42,981
Can't think.
Can't think.

864
00:30:43,071 --> 00:30:44,026
Flatlining.

865
00:30:44,111 --> 00:30:44,987
Uh, Mike?

866
00:30:45,071 --> 00:30:47,187
I think she's getting tired.

867
00:30:47,271 --> 00:30:49,023
Well, then
why don't you

868
00:30:49,111 --> 00:30:51,500
find someplace
for it to sleep?

869
00:30:51,591 --> 00:30:53,104
While I think of a plan!

870
00:30:54,631 --> 00:30:56,223
Are you sleepy?

871
00:30:56,311 --> 00:30:58,222
You want to sleep?

872
00:30:58,311 --> 00:30:59,300
Is that what you want?

873
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:00,710
Huh?

874
00:31:08,631 --> 00:31:12,510
( crunching )

875
00:31:12,591 --> 00:31:13,626
Okay, all right.

876
00:31:13,711 --> 00:31:15,224
I'm making a nice
little area for you to...

877
00:31:15,311 --> 00:31:16,346
( giggling )

878
00:31:16,431 --> 00:31:18,149
No. Hey, hey,
that's my bed!

879
00:31:18,231 --> 00:31:19,584
You're going to get
your germs all over it.

880
00:31:21,711 --> 00:31:22,666
( sighing ):
Fine.

881
00:31:22,751 --> 00:31:25,026
My chair is
more comfortable anyway.

882
00:31:25,111 --> 00:31:26,339
( yells )

883
00:31:26,431 --> 00:31:27,307
What?

884
00:31:27,391 --> 00:31:28,540
( speaking fearfully )

885
00:31:30,231 --> 00:31:31,107
It's just a closet.

886
00:31:31,191 --> 00:31:32,260
Will you go to sleep?

887
00:31:35,911 --> 00:31:37,663
Hey, that looks like Randall.

888
00:31:37,751 --> 00:31:40,026
Randall's your monster.

889
00:31:40,111 --> 00:31:43,023
You think he's going
to come through the closet

890
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:43,987
and scare you.

891
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:45,982
Oh, boy,
how do I explain this?

892
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:46,981
Uh, it's empty.

893
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,345
-See?
-Ah!

894
00:31:48,431 --> 00:31:50,103
No monster in here.

895
00:31:53,551 --> 00:31:54,950
Well, now there is

896
00:31:55,031 --> 00:31:57,545
but I'm not going to scare you.

897
00:31:57,631 --> 00:31:58,700
I'm off-duty.

898
00:32:02,511 --> 00:32:03,739
Okay.

899
00:32:03,831 --> 00:32:08,109
How about I sit here,
until you fall asleep?

900
00:32:10,111 --> 00:32:11,226
Go ahead.

901
00:32:11,311 --> 00:32:12,630
Go to sleep.

902
00:32:12,711 --> 00:32:13,587
Now.

903
00:32:13,671 --> 00:32:16,469
Now... go.

904
00:32:16,551 --> 00:32:17,745
Uh, you...

905
00:32:17,831 --> 00:32:18,980
go...

906
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:20,060
to...

907
00:32:20,151 --> 00:32:21,140
sleep.

908
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:22,710
( ioitating snoring )

909
00:32:22,791 --> 00:32:24,144
( giggles )

910
00:32:27,511 --> 00:32:29,229
( sighs in relief )

911
00:32:45,471 --> 00:32:47,826
( door creaks softly )

912
00:32:53,391 --> 00:32:54,904
Hey, Mike,
this might sound crazy

913
00:32:54,991 --> 00:32:57,027
but I don't think
that kid's dangerous.

914
00:32:57,111 --> 00:32:59,181
Really? Well, in that case,
let's keep it.

915
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:01,148
I always wanted a pet
that could kill me!

916
00:33:01,231 --> 00:33:02,380
Now, look.

917
00:33:02,471 --> 00:33:04,143
What if we just put
her back in her door?

918
00:33:04,231 --> 00:33:05,584
What?

919
00:33:05,671 --> 00:33:06,581
Mike, think about it.

920
00:33:06,671 --> 00:33:08,104
If we send her back,
it's like it never happened.

921
00:33:08,191 --> 00:33:09,180
Everything goes back to normal.

922
00:33:09,271 --> 00:33:10,147
Is that a joke?

923
00:33:10,231 --> 00:33:11,266
Tell me you're joking.

924
00:33:12,871 --> 00:33:15,146
Sulley, I'd like to think
that, given the circumstances

925
00:33:15,231 --> 00:33:16,869
I have been extremely
forgiving up to now

926
00:33:16,951 --> 00:33:18,100
but that is a horrible idea!

927
00:33:18,191 --> 00:33:19,385
What are we going to do?

928
00:33:19,471 --> 00:33:21,223
March right out into
public with that thing?

929
00:33:21,311 --> 00:33:23,700
Then I guess we just waltz
right up to the factory, right?

930
00:33:23,875 --> 00:33:26,867
I can't believe we
are waltzing right
up to the factory.

931
00:33:26,955 --> 00:33:29,913
Sulley, a mop,
a couple of lights
and some chair fabric

932
00:33:29,995 --> 00:33:31,553
are not going
to fool anyone!

933
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:33,751
Just think about
a few names, will you?

934
00:33:33,835 --> 00:33:35,951
Loch Ness, Bigfoot,
the Abominable Snowman--

935
00:33:36,035 --> 00:33:38,549
they all got one thing
in common, pal-- banishment.

936
00:33:38,635 --> 00:33:39,909
We could be next!

937
00:33:39,995 --> 00:33:41,110
Don't panic--
we can do this.

938
00:33:41,195 --> 00:33:42,230
Hey, how you doing, Frank?

939
00:33:42,315 --> 00:33:43,225
Hey, guys.

940
00:33:43,315 --> 00:33:44,350
Everything's going

941
00:33:44,435 --> 00:33:45,584
to be okay.

942
00:33:45,675 --> 00:33:46,585
( gasping )

943
00:33:46,675 --> 00:33:48,586
( equipoent buzzing loudly )

944
00:33:50,355 --> 00:33:51,947
Number One wants this place
dusted for prints.

945
00:33:52,035 --> 00:33:53,184
Careful with that.

946
00:33:53,275 --> 00:33:54,594
I got a good view from here.

947
00:33:54,675 --> 00:33:56,233
A little lower.

948
00:33:56,315 --> 00:33:58,829
This was recovered
at the scene.

949
00:33:58,915 --> 00:33:59,791
Don't panic.
Don't panic!

950
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:00,785
Don't tell me
not to panic.

951
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:01,785
Just keep it together.

952
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:02,751
Everything is not okay!

953
00:34:02,835 --> 00:34:03,711
LITTLE GIRL:
Boo.

954
00:34:03,795 --> 00:34:05,228
...could be contaminated.

955
00:34:05,315 --> 00:34:06,350
Gentlemen, safety

956
00:34:06,435 --> 00:34:07,550
is our number one concern.

957
00:34:07,635 --> 00:34:08,909
If there's anything that...

958
00:34:08,995 --> 00:34:09,905
Not now, not now.

959
00:34:09,995 --> 00:34:11,474
Oh, hello, little one.

960
00:34:11,555 --> 00:34:13,193
Where did you come from?

961
00:34:13,275 --> 00:34:14,230
Mr Waternoose!

962
00:34:14,315 --> 00:34:15,953
Ah,James!
Is this one yours?

963
00:34:16,035 --> 00:34:19,505
Actually, that's my, uh,
cousin's sister's daughter, sir.

964
00:34:19,595 --> 00:34:21,267
Yeah, it's, uh...

965
00:34:21,355 --> 00:34:24,028
''Bring an Obscure Relative
to Work Day.''

966
00:34:24,115 --> 00:34:25,548
Hmm, must have
missed the memo.

967
00:34:25,635 --> 00:34:26,670
Well, listen,James

968
00:34:26,755 --> 00:34:29,144
why don't you stop by
the simulator after lunch today

969
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:30,827
and give us
that scare demonstration

970
00:34:30,915 --> 00:34:32,030
we talked about, huh?

971
00:34:32,115 --> 00:34:33,594
Oh, oh, sir, uh....

972
00:34:33,675 --> 00:34:34,903
Excuse me,
Mr Waternoose?

973
00:34:34,995 --> 00:34:36,110
Yes, yes, I'm coming.

974
00:34:36,195 --> 00:34:38,345
All right then, I'll see
you this afternoon,James.

975
00:34:38,435 --> 00:34:40,551
That is, if these gentlemen
haven't shut us down.

976
00:34:40,635 --> 00:34:41,590
Oh, boy.

977
00:34:41,675 --> 00:34:42,585
Oh, a scare demo.

978
00:34:42,675 --> 00:34:43,630
Well, that is great.

979
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:44,704
Why am I
the last to know?

980
00:34:44,795 --> 00:34:46,831
We can bring your cousin's
sister's daughter along.

981
00:34:46,915 --> 00:34:47,825
She'll be a big hit!

982
00:34:47,915 --> 00:34:49,030
( equipoent buzzing loudly )

983
00:34:49,115 --> 00:34:50,150
Halt!

984
00:34:50,235 --> 00:34:51,145
( yelling )

985
00:34:51,235 --> 00:34:52,190
Stop him!

986
00:34:52,275 --> 00:34:53,867
Hold him down.

987
00:34:57,435 --> 00:34:58,550
Come on,
the coast is clear.

988
00:34:58,635 --> 00:35:01,069
Okay, all we have to do
is get rid of that thing.

989
00:35:01,155 --> 00:35:03,146
So, wait here while
I get its card key.

990
00:35:03,235 --> 00:35:04,384
But she can't stay here.

991
00:35:04,475 --> 00:35:05,624
This is the men's room.

992
00:35:05,715 --> 00:35:08,354
That is the weirdest thing
you have ever said.

993
00:35:08,435 --> 00:35:09,629
It's fine. It's okay.

994
00:35:09,715 --> 00:35:10,750
Look, it loves it here!

995
00:35:10,835 --> 00:35:11,824
It's dancing with joy!

996
00:35:11,915 --> 00:35:13,143
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

997
00:35:13,235 --> 00:35:15,191
I'll be right back
with its door key.

998
00:35:15,275 --> 00:35:16,390
( laughs )

999
00:35:16,475 --> 00:35:18,943
That's a cute little
dance you've got.

1000
00:35:19,035 --> 00:35:20,627
It almost looks
like you've got to...

1001
00:35:20,715 --> 00:35:22,307
( whining )

1002
00:35:22,395 --> 00:35:24,226
Oh.

1003
00:35:24,315 --> 00:35:27,193
( singing in baby talk )

1004
00:35:31,875 --> 00:35:33,706
( singing stops )

1005
00:35:33,795 --> 00:35:37,344
Uh, are you
done in there?

1006
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:38,584
( squeals )

1007
00:35:38,675 --> 00:35:41,030
Ah! Sorry. Sorry.

1008
00:35:41,115 --> 00:35:43,754
( singing )

1009
00:35:49,715 --> 00:35:52,354
( toilet flushes )

1010
00:35:52,435 --> 00:35:54,505
Okay, you
finished now, right?

1011
00:35:54,595 --> 00:35:55,789
Hello?

1012
00:35:57,195 --> 00:35:58,071
( yells )

1013
00:36:00,275 --> 00:36:01,469
Boo.

1014
00:36:01,555 --> 00:36:02,783
( giggles )

1015
00:36:02,875 --> 00:36:05,025
( sighs )

1016
00:36:05,115 --> 00:36:06,628
( giggling )

1017
00:36:08,715 --> 00:36:10,467
( chuckles )

1018
00:36:10,555 --> 00:36:13,228
Where did she go?

1019
00:36:13,315 --> 00:36:15,545
Oh, did she disappear?

1020
00:36:15,635 --> 00:36:17,990
Did she turn invisible?

1021
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:19,667
( giggling softly )

1022
00:36:19,755 --> 00:36:21,234
I just have no idea.

1023
00:36:22,595 --> 00:36:24,028
Gotcha!

1024
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:26,629
Boo.

1025
00:36:26,715 --> 00:36:27,864
( giggles )

1026
00:36:27,955 --> 00:36:29,786
Hey, you're good.

1027
00:36:31,275 --> 00:36:32,594
( sighs )

1028
00:36:35,315 --> 00:36:38,625
Be relaxed,
be relaxed, be relaxed.

1029
00:36:38,715 --> 00:36:40,148
Roz, my tender,
oozing blossom

1030
00:36:40,235 --> 00:36:41,714
you're looking
fabulous today.

1031
00:36:41,795 --> 00:36:42,944
Is that a new haircut?

1032
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:43,945
Come on, tell me.

1033
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,354
It's a new haircut,
isn't it?

1034
00:36:45,435 --> 00:36:46,311
That's got to be
a new haircut.

1035
00:36:46,395 --> 00:36:47,305
New make-up?
You've had a lift.

1036
00:36:47,395 --> 00:36:48,714
You've had a tuck.
You've had something.

1037
00:36:48,795 --> 00:36:50,513
Something has been
inserted in your skin

1038
00:36:50,595 --> 00:36:51,789
that makes you look like...

1039
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:53,388
( sighs )

1040
00:36:53,475 --> 00:36:54,669
Listen, I need a favour.

1041
00:36:54,755 --> 00:36:56,586
Randall was working
late last night

1042
00:36:56,675 --> 00:36:57,949
out on the scare floor.

1043
00:36:58,035 --> 00:37:00,629
I really need the key
for the door he was using.

1044
00:37:00,715 --> 00:37:02,228
Well, isn't that nice?

1045
00:37:02,315 --> 00:37:04,510
But guess what?

1046
00:37:04,595 --> 00:37:07,792
You didn't turn in
your paperwork last night.

1047
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:09,672
He didn't... I...
no paperwork?

1048
00:37:09,755 --> 00:37:11,711
This office is now closed.

1049
00:37:12,715 --> 00:37:14,273
( Mike screaos in pain )

1050
00:37:14,355 --> 00:37:16,630
Ready or not, here I come!

1051
00:37:16,715 --> 00:37:18,467
I'm getting warmer.

1052
00:37:18,555 --> 00:37:19,704
Any second now.

1053
00:37:19,795 --> 00:37:22,787
Fee fi fo...

1054
00:37:22,875 --> 00:37:23,910
What are you doing?!

1055
00:37:23,995 --> 00:37:25,667
I-I'm looking
for the kid.

1056
00:37:25,755 --> 00:37:26,870
You lost it?!

1057
00:37:26,955 --> 00:37:28,104
No, no, she was just....

1058
00:37:28,195 --> 00:37:29,867
( squeals )

1059
00:37:29,955 --> 00:37:31,024
Here she is.

1060
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:32,070
( whining )

1061
00:37:32,155 --> 00:37:33,429
Hey, what's the matter?

1062
00:37:33,515 --> 00:37:36,075
RAND ALL:
I already told your buddies
I haven't seen anything.

1063
00:37:36,155 --> 00:37:37,554
CD A AGENT:
All right. Carry on.

1064
00:37:45,475 --> 00:37:46,544
( splashing )

1065
00:37:47,355 --> 00:37:48,549
Randall!
Thank goodness!

1066
00:37:48,635 --> 00:37:50,865
What are we going to do
about the child?

1067
00:37:50,955 --> 00:37:52,104
Shh!

1068
00:37:53,275 --> 00:37:55,186
Shh, shh, shh.

1069
00:38:00,075 --> 00:38:01,872
( door slaos open )

1070
00:38:05,715 --> 00:38:06,750
( door slaos open )

1071
00:38:11,475 --> 00:38:13,386
The front page!
It's on the front page.

1072
00:38:13,475 --> 00:38:15,147
The child--
the one you were after.

1073
00:38:15,235 --> 00:38:16,270
Will you be quiet?!

1074
00:38:16,355 --> 00:38:18,391
Don't you think I'm aware
of the situation?

1075
00:38:18,475 --> 00:38:20,193
I was up all night
trying to find it.

1076
00:38:20,275 --> 00:38:21,594
I did a simple
calculation

1077
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:24,064
factoring in the size
of the sushi restaurant.

1078
00:38:24,155 --> 00:38:25,554
The child
may have escaped!

1079
00:38:25,635 --> 00:38:27,148
Yeah, well, until
we know for sure

1080
00:38:27,235 --> 00:38:29,305
we're going to act like
nothing happened, understand?

1081
00:38:29,395 --> 00:38:31,033
You just get the
machine up and running.

1082
00:38:31,115 --> 00:38:32,184
I'll take care of the kid.

1083
00:38:32,275 --> 00:38:34,391
And when I find whoever
let it out, they're dead!

1084
00:38:34,475 --> 00:38:35,828
Oh!

1085
00:38:37,275 --> 00:38:38,469
Why are you still here?

1086
00:38:38,555 --> 00:38:39,704
Come on, go!

1087
00:38:39,795 --> 00:38:40,864
Move! Now!

1088
00:38:40,955 --> 00:38:42,229
FUNGUS:
Ow, ow! I'm not here.

1089
00:38:42,315 --> 00:38:44,351
SULLEY ( whispering ):
They're gone.

1090
00:38:44,435 --> 00:38:45,868
( squeaking and splashing )

1091
00:38:45,955 --> 00:38:47,627
LITTLE GIRL:
Ew.

1092
00:38:47,715 --> 00:38:48,830
MIKE:
This is bad.

1093
00:38:48,915 --> 00:38:50,268
This is so very bad.

1094
00:38:50,355 --> 00:38:51,834
What were they talking
about a machine?

1095
00:38:51,915 --> 00:38:52,904
Who cares? Oh!

1096
00:38:52,995 --> 00:38:54,394
Look, don't panic--
all we have to do

1097
00:38:54,475 --> 00:38:56,033
is call her door down
and send her home.

1098
00:38:56,115 --> 00:38:57,184
You're right.
You're right.

1099
00:38:57,275 --> 00:38:59,391
We're just two regular joes
on our way to work.

1100
00:38:59,475 --> 00:39:00,828
We will blend right in.

1101
00:39:00,915 --> 00:39:02,143
Top of the mornin', fellas!

1102
00:39:02,235 --> 00:39:03,509
Hey, what's shakin',
bacon?

1103
00:39:03,595 --> 00:39:04,630
Did you lose weight?

1104
00:39:04,715 --> 00:39:05,830
Or a limb?

1105
00:39:05,915 --> 00:39:07,109
You have
her card key, right?

1106
00:39:07,195 --> 00:39:08,389
Of course
I have her card key.

1107
00:39:08,475 --> 00:39:09,828
I told you
I'd get her card key.

1108
00:39:09,915 --> 00:39:10,984
I went and got
her card key

1109
00:39:11,075 --> 00:39:12,986
and now I have her card key.

1110
00:39:14,075 --> 00:39:16,111
Okay, here we go.

1111
00:39:16,195 --> 00:39:17,264
Take care of yourself.

1112
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,311
Try not to run
through any more closets.

1113
00:39:19,395 --> 00:39:20,828
( giggles )

1114
00:39:20,915 --> 00:39:23,270
Mike,
that's not her door.

1115
00:39:23,355 --> 00:39:24,913
What are you
talking about?

1116
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:26,508
Of course it's her door.
It's her door.

1117
00:39:26,595 --> 00:39:28,551
No, her door was white
and it had flowers on it.

1118
00:39:28,635 --> 00:39:30,353
No. It must have been
dark last night

1119
00:39:30,435 --> 00:39:31,550
because this is its door.

1120
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:32,704
( polka ousic playing )

1121
00:39:32,795 --> 00:39:33,750
Hey, you hear that?

1122
00:39:33,835 --> 00:39:35,712
Sounds like fun in there!

1123
00:39:35,795 --> 00:39:37,114
Okay, send me a postcard, kid.

1124
00:39:37,195 --> 00:39:38,594
That's Mike Wazowski, care of

1125
00:39:38,675 --> 00:39:40,791
22 Mike-Wazowski-
you-got-your-life-back Lane.

1126
00:39:40,875 --> 00:39:42,194
Mowki Kowski.

1127
00:39:42,275 --> 00:39:43,867
Very good.
Now bon voyage!

1128
00:39:43,955 --> 00:39:45,308
Bye-bye!
Come on.

1129
00:39:45,395 --> 00:39:46,908
Look at the stick.
See the stick?

1130
00:39:46,995 --> 00:39:48,144
Go get the stick!
Go fetch.

1131
00:39:48,235 --> 00:39:50,112
Mike, this isn't
Boo's door.

1132
00:39:50,195 --> 00:39:51,469
Boo? What's Boo?

1133
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,785
That's what I decided
to call her.

1134
00:39:53,875 --> 00:39:55,274
Is there a problem?

1135
00:39:55,355 --> 00:39:56,993
Sulley, you're not
supposed to name it.

1136
00:39:57,075 --> 00:39:59,270
Once you name it,
you start getting attached to it!

1137
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,344
Now put that thing

1138
00:40:00,435 --> 00:40:03,233
back where it came from,
or so help me...

1139
00:40:06,715 --> 00:40:07,750
Oh, hey!

1140
00:40:07,835 --> 00:40:10,395
We're rehearsing a scene
for the upcoming company play

1141
00:40:10,475 --> 00:40:12,705
~called Put That Thing
Back Where It Caoe Froo

1142
00:40:12,795 --> 00:40:13,989
Or So Help Me.

1143
00:40:14,075 --> 00:40:14,985
( Mike laughing )

1144
00:40:15,075 --> 00:40:16,064
It's a musical!

1145
00:40:16,155 --> 00:40:18,146
Put that thing back where
it came from or so help me

1146
00:40:18,235 --> 00:40:19,350
Bom-bom, bom-bom,
bom-bom...

1147
00:40:19,435 --> 00:40:20,311
So help me,
so help me.

1148
00:40:20,395 --> 00:40:21,544
And cut!

1149
00:40:21,635 --> 00:40:22,704
We're still working on it.

1150
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:23,671
It's a work in progress

1151
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,268
but, hey,
we need ushers.

1152
00:40:25,355 --> 00:40:26,390
Sulley, I've had enough.

1153
00:40:26,475 --> 00:40:28,067
Now say goodbye to...
where'd it go?

1154
00:40:28,155 --> 00:40:29,110
What'd you do with it?

1155
00:40:29,195 --> 00:40:30,105
( gasps ):
Where is she?

1156
00:40:30,195 --> 00:40:31,150
I don't believe it.

1157
00:40:31,235 --> 00:40:32,463
She got away
from you again?!

1158
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:33,351
Well, that is just...

1159
00:40:33,435 --> 00:40:34,390
Wait a minute.

1160
00:40:34,475 --> 00:40:35,954
The sun is coming up.

1161
00:40:36,035 --> 00:40:37,184
This is perfect!

1162
00:40:37,275 --> 00:40:38,993
She's gone!

1163
00:40:39,075 --> 00:40:40,349
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1164
00:40:40,435 --> 00:40:41,311
Where are you going?

1165
00:40:41,395 --> 00:40:42,589
Sulley, please,
don't blow this.

1166
00:40:42,675 --> 00:40:44,506
Not when we're so close
to breaking the record.

1167
00:40:44,595 --> 00:40:45,823
Somebody else
will find the kid.

1168
00:40:45,915 --> 00:40:47,143
It'll be their problem,
not ours!

1169
00:40:47,235 --> 00:40:48,145
She's out of our hair!

1170
00:40:49,115 --> 00:40:50,514
What are you
two doing?

1171
00:40:50,595 --> 00:40:52,586
They're rehearsing a play.

1172
00:40:52,675 --> 00:40:54,154
She's out of our hair!

1173
00:40:54,235 --> 00:40:55,304
Can it, Wazowski!

1174
00:40:55,395 --> 00:40:58,228
So, what do you think
of that kid getting out, Sullivan?

1175
00:40:58,315 --> 00:40:59,384
Pretty crazy, huh?

1176
00:40:59,475 --> 00:41:01,227
Oh, yeah, crazy.

1177
00:41:01,315 --> 00:41:02,304
Word on the street is the kid's

1178
00:41:02,395 --> 00:41:03,464
been traced back
to this factory.

1179
00:41:03,555 --> 00:41:04,704
You haven't seen anything,
have you?

1180
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,194
Uh, well, uh...

1181
00:41:06,275 --> 00:41:07,390
No, no way!

1182
00:41:07,475 --> 00:41:09,625
But if it was
an inside job

1183
00:41:09,715 --> 00:41:11,512
I'd put my money
on Waxford.

1184
00:41:11,595 --> 00:41:12,664
Waxford?

1185
00:41:12,755 --> 00:41:13,904
Yeah, the one
at station six.

1186
00:41:13,995 --> 00:41:15,428
You know, he's got
them shifty eyes.

1187
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:16,709
Hey, Waxford!

1188
00:41:16,795 --> 00:41:17,910
Sulley!

1189
00:41:17,995 --> 00:41:19,553
CELIA:
Michael Wazowski!

1190
00:41:21,235 --> 00:41:22,270
( whiopers )

1191
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:24,391
Last night was one
of the worst nights

1192
00:41:24,475 --> 00:41:25,988
of my entire life,
bar none!

1193
00:41:26,075 --> 00:41:27,508
( hissing )

1194
00:41:28,395 --> 00:41:29,589
I thought
you cared about me.

1195
00:41:29,675 --> 00:41:30,585
Honey, please.

1196
00:41:30,675 --> 00:41:32,870
Schmoopsie, I thought
you liked sushi.

1197
00:41:32,955 --> 00:41:34,388
CELIA:
Sushi? Sushi?!!

1198
00:41:34,475 --> 00:41:36,989
You think this is
about sushi?!

1199
00:41:42,395 --> 00:41:43,544
Wazowski!

1200
00:41:43,635 --> 00:41:45,148
Michael! Mike...

1201
00:41:45,235 --> 00:41:46,429
Men.

1202
00:41:46,515 --> 00:41:47,470
( panting )

1203
00:41:47,555 --> 00:41:48,954
Breathe. Keep breathing.

1204
00:41:57,195 --> 00:41:58,708
Whew.

1205
00:41:58,795 --> 00:41:59,830
Yikes!

1206
00:41:59,915 --> 00:42:01,633
Where's the kid?

1207
00:42:01,715 --> 00:42:03,273
Kid? What kid?

1208
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:04,754
It's here in
the factory, isn't it?

1209
00:42:04,835 --> 00:42:05,984
You're not
pinning this on me.

1210
00:42:06,075 --> 00:42:07,269
It never would
have gotten out

1211
00:42:07,355 --> 00:42:08,913
if you hadn't been
cheating last night!

1212
00:42:08,995 --> 00:42:10,144
Cheating?

1213
00:42:11,355 --> 00:42:12,913
Cheating. Right.

1214
00:42:12,995 --> 00:42:16,783
Okay, I think I know how
to make this all go away.

1215
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:20,914
What happens when
the whistle blows
in five minutes?

1216
00:42:20,995 --> 00:42:23,429
Uh... I get a time-out?

1217
00:42:23,515 --> 00:42:26,109
Everyone goes to lunch!

1218
00:42:26,195 --> 00:42:29,346
Which means the scare floor
will be...?

1219
00:42:30,595 --> 00:42:31,710
Painted?

1220
00:42:31,795 --> 00:42:34,628
Empty! It'll be
empty, you idiot!

1221
00:42:34,715 --> 00:42:36,387
You see that clock?

1222
00:42:36,475 --> 00:42:38,545
When the big hand
is pointing up

1223
00:42:38,635 --> 00:42:40,751
and the little hand
is pointing up

1224
00:42:40,835 --> 00:42:43,110
the kid's door
will be in my station.

1225
00:42:43,195 --> 00:42:45,390
But when the big hand
points down

1226
00:42:45,475 --> 00:42:47,943
the door will be gone.

1227
00:42:48,035 --> 00:42:50,947
You have until then
to put the kid back.

1228
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:53,629
Get the picture?

1229
00:42:53,715 --> 00:42:56,149
( roaring playfully )

1230
00:43:03,315 --> 00:43:04,191
Boo!

1231
00:43:04,275 --> 00:43:05,708
( giggles )

1232
00:43:05,795 --> 00:43:06,671
No.

1233
00:43:06,755 --> 00:43:07,790
Hey, you! Halt!

1234
00:43:07,875 --> 00:43:09,388
He's the one.

1235
00:43:09,475 --> 00:43:10,749
The one from
the commercial!

1236
00:43:10,835 --> 00:43:11,950
Affirmative.
That's him.

1237
00:43:12,035 --> 00:43:13,184
Can we get
an autograph?

1238
00:43:13,275 --> 00:43:14,708
Oh, oh, sure.
No problem.

1239
00:43:14,795 --> 00:43:17,673
You can make that out
to Bethany, my daughter.

1240
00:43:17,755 --> 00:43:18,949
Yes. Let's see....

1241
00:43:19,035 --> 00:43:20,707
''From your scary friend

1242
00:43:20,795 --> 00:43:22,308
best wishes...''

1243
00:43:22,395 --> 00:43:24,306
So I said,
''If you talk to me

1244
00:43:24,395 --> 00:43:26,511
like that again,
we're through!''

1245
00:43:26,595 --> 00:43:27,584
What'd she say?

1246
00:43:27,675 --> 00:43:28,744
You know my mom.

1247
00:43:28,835 --> 00:43:30,473
She sent me to my room.

1248
00:43:30,555 --> 00:43:32,147
See you guys later.
Take it easy.

1249
00:43:32,235 --> 00:43:33,350
Bottoms up!

1250
00:43:36,475 --> 00:43:37,191
( gasps in horror )

1251
00:43:49,595 --> 00:43:50,664
No!

1252
00:43:50,755 --> 00:43:54,191
( singing )

1253
00:43:54,275 --> 00:43:55,105
Whoa!

1254
00:43:55,195 --> 00:43:56,310
Hey.

1255
00:43:56,395 --> 00:43:58,431
( growling )

1256
00:43:58,515 --> 00:43:59,948
Oh, well, hello, there.

1257
00:44:00,035 --> 00:44:01,309
What's your name?

1258
00:44:01,395 --> 00:44:03,113
Mike Wazowski!

1259
00:44:04,275 --> 00:44:06,869
( oachinery pounding loudly )

1260
00:44:14,995 --> 00:44:16,951
( grinding and chopping )

1261
00:44:24,755 --> 00:44:26,871
( panting )

1262
00:44:36,115 --> 00:44:39,027
( ooans )

1263
00:44:40,475 --> 00:44:42,033
Sulley!

1264
00:44:42,115 --> 00:44:43,787
Oh, Sulley.

1265
00:44:44,795 --> 00:44:47,070
Okay, Sulley, come on, enough.

1266
00:44:47,155 --> 00:44:49,111
Hey, you guys seen
Sulley anywhere?

1267
00:44:49,195 --> 00:44:50,344
Nope. Sorry.

1268
00:44:50,435 --> 00:44:51,504
Oh, Sulley!

1269
00:44:51,595 --> 00:44:53,984
Boy, Wazowski looks
like he's in trouble.

1270
00:44:54,075 --> 00:44:55,428
( squeaking and quacking )

1271
00:44:55,515 --> 00:44:56,709
231 9!

1272
00:44:56,795 --> 00:44:58,353
We have a 231 9!

1273
00:44:58,435 --> 00:44:59,504
Oh, dear.

1274
00:44:59,595 --> 00:45:00,664
Get him!

1275
00:45:00,755 --> 00:45:02,586
Sulley?

1276
00:45:02,675 --> 00:45:04,154
Sulley!

1277
00:45:05,395 --> 00:45:06,953
( ooaning )

1278
00:45:07,035 --> 00:45:07,990
Sulley!

1279
00:45:08,075 --> 00:45:09,144
Oh, great news, pal.

1280
00:45:09,235 --> 00:45:10,463
I got us a way out of this mess

1281
00:45:10,555 --> 00:45:11,670
but we got to hurry.

1282
00:45:11,755 --> 00:45:12,790
Where is it?

1283
00:45:12,875 --> 00:45:14,831
( whiopering )

1284
00:45:14,915 --> 00:45:16,712
Sull, that's
a cube of garbage.

1285
00:45:16,795 --> 00:45:18,023
( squeaks )

1286
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:19,309
Uh-oh.

1287
00:45:19,395 --> 00:45:22,148
I-I can still hear
her little voice.

1288
00:45:22,235 --> 00:45:23,588
BOO:
Mike Wazowski!

1289
00:45:23,675 --> 00:45:24,949
Hey, I can hear her, too.

1290
00:45:25,035 --> 00:45:26,468
BABY MONSTERS:
Mike Wazowski!

1291
00:45:26,555 --> 00:45:28,113
How many kids
you got in there?

1292
00:45:28,195 --> 00:45:30,026
Mike Wazowski!

1293
00:45:30,115 --> 00:45:31,184
Kitty!

1294
00:45:31,275 --> 00:45:32,913
Boo!

1295
00:45:33,915 --> 00:45:35,234
Boo, oh,
you're all right!

1296
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:37,146
I was so worried!

1297
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:41,513
Don't you ever run away
from me again, young lady!

1298
00:45:41,595 --> 00:45:44,473
Oh, but I'm so glad
you're safe.

1299
00:45:44,555 --> 00:45:47,513
My, what an affectionate father.

1300
00:45:47,595 --> 00:45:49,506
Actually, she's
my cousin's sister's...

1301
00:45:49,595 --> 00:45:50,471
Okay, Sulley.

1302
00:45:50,555 --> 00:45:51,544
That's enough.
Let's go.

1303
00:45:51,635 --> 00:45:52,511
Mike Wazowski!

1304
00:45:52,595 --> 00:45:53,471
Yeah, yeah.

1305
00:45:53,555 --> 00:45:54,829
Step aside, kid.
We're in a...

1306
00:45:54,915 --> 00:45:55,665
( screaos in pain )

1307
00:45:55,755 --> 00:45:56,551
( screaos with laughter )

1308
00:45:56,635 --> 00:45:57,306
( electrical buzzing )

1309
00:45:57,395 --> 00:45:58,305
( light bulbs shattering )

1310
00:45:58,395 --> 00:45:59,464
( gasping )

1311
00:45:59,555 --> 00:46:01,785
( baby oonsters screaoing
~ and crying )

1312
00:46:01,875 --> 00:46:04,389
Will you stop
making Boo laugh?

1313
00:46:04,475 --> 00:46:06,067
I didn't, so come on!

1314
00:46:06,155 --> 00:46:08,544
( screaoing and crying
~ continue )

1315
00:46:08,635 --> 00:46:09,590
I still don't understand.

1316
00:46:09,675 --> 00:46:10,551
You've got Boo's door?

1317
00:46:10,635 --> 00:46:11,465
I'll explain later.

1318
00:46:11,555 --> 00:46:12,431
Run.

1319
00:46:12,515 --> 00:46:13,834
Okay, let's move,
let's move, let's move.

1320
00:46:13,915 --> 00:46:14,950
Come on.

1321
00:46:15,035 --> 00:46:16,832
Oh, please be there, please
be there, please be there.

1322
00:46:16,915 --> 00:46:18,348
There it is!

1323
00:46:18,435 --> 00:46:19,311
Just like Randall said!

1324
00:46:19,395 --> 00:46:20,305
Randall?
Wait a minute.

1325
00:46:20,395 --> 00:46:21,271
( cries out in fear )

1326
00:46:21,355 --> 00:46:22,231
Oh, hey.

1327
00:46:22,315 --> 00:46:23,191
One, two, three, four!

1328
00:46:23,275 --> 00:46:24,264
Get the kid back
through the door!

1329
00:46:24,355 --> 00:46:25,231
Hey, hey.

1330
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:26,384
We're going to get
our lives back.

1331
00:46:26,475 --> 00:46:27,351
The nightmare is over.

1332
00:46:27,435 --> 00:46:28,311
Hey, it's okay, Boo.

1333
00:46:28,395 --> 00:46:29,066
What's the matter?

1334
00:46:29,155 --> 00:46:30,383
Come on, it's time to move!

1335
00:46:30,475 --> 00:46:31,385
Mike, what are you thinking?

1336
00:46:31,475 --> 00:46:32,351
We can't trust Randall.

1337
00:46:32,435 --> 00:46:33,311
He's after Boo.

1338
00:46:33,395 --> 00:46:34,271
Who cares?
Let's go.

1339
00:46:34,355 --> 00:46:35,310
This is a limited time offer.

1340
00:46:35,395 --> 00:46:36,271
No, no.

1341
00:46:36,355 --> 00:46:37,231
I don't like this.

1342
00:46:37,315 --> 00:46:39,624
Look, Sulley, you wanted
her door and there it is.

1343
00:46:39,715 --> 00:46:40,591
Now, let's move.

1344
00:46:40,675 --> 00:46:42,188
No, Mike.

1345
00:46:42,275 --> 00:46:44,391
( sighs ):
You want me to prove
everything's on the up-and-up?

1346
00:46:44,475 --> 00:46:45,908
Fine! He wants the door,
I get the door...

1347
00:46:45,995 --> 00:46:46,791
( whispering ):
Mike, wait!

1348
00:46:46,875 --> 00:46:48,467
He's a paranoid
delusional furball.

1349
00:46:51,035 --> 00:46:51,831
Mike!

1350
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:57,708
( whiopers in fear )

1351
00:47:02,115 --> 00:47:03,309
( whining )

1352
00:47:03,395 --> 00:47:05,067
Shh, shh, shh.

1353
00:47:19,875 --> 00:47:20,910
( soall cry of surprise )

1354
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:41,033
( lunch bell rings )

1355
00:47:48,315 --> 00:47:51,546
Hey, Sulley,
where you been all day?

1356
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:53,114
Sulley? Sulley?

1357
00:48:07,035 --> 00:48:07,945
Huh?

1358
00:48:08,035 --> 00:48:09,309
( whispering ):
Mike?

1359
00:48:09,395 --> 00:48:10,271
Mike?

1360
00:48:10,355 --> 00:48:13,028
Where are you?

1361
00:48:13,115 --> 00:48:14,867
You in there?

1362
00:48:14,955 --> 00:48:16,707
Where are you, buddy?

1363
00:48:16,795 --> 00:48:17,750
Mike?

1364
00:48:17,835 --> 00:48:19,154
Hey.

1365
00:48:25,275 --> 00:48:26,674
( door thunks )

1366
00:48:28,275 --> 00:48:29,469
( excited baby talk )

1367
00:48:29,555 --> 00:48:31,113
Boo, way to go.

1368
00:48:31,195 --> 00:48:32,184
( giggles )

1369
00:48:38,795 --> 00:48:39,989
It's okay.

1370
00:48:43,555 --> 00:48:45,864
( door clunks shut )

1371
00:48:55,115 --> 00:48:59,666
( pipes whistling and venting )

1372
00:49:03,475 --> 00:49:06,035
( distant voices )

1373
00:49:08,875 --> 00:49:10,991
RAND ALL:
Yes! I got the kid!

1374
00:49:11,075 --> 00:49:12,428
FUNGUS:
Oh, huzzah!

1375
00:49:12,515 --> 00:49:13,391
That's great news.

1376
00:49:13,475 --> 00:49:15,227
Not that I was concerned,
of course.

1377
00:49:15,315 --> 00:49:16,794
Just get over
here and help me!

1378
00:49:16,875 --> 00:49:17,671
Come on, come
on, come on.

1379
00:49:17,755 --> 00:49:18,710
While we're young
here, Fungus!

1380
00:49:20,955 --> 00:49:23,230
( both straining )

1381
00:49:23,315 --> 00:49:25,033
Kid needs to take
off a few pounds.

1382
00:49:28,915 --> 00:49:29,791
( yelps )

1383
00:49:29,875 --> 00:49:30,785
Wazowski?!

1384
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:32,274
Where is it,
you little one-eyed cretin?

1385
00:49:32,355 --> 00:49:33,344
Okay, first of all,
it's cree-tin.

1386
00:49:33,435 --> 00:49:34,311
If you're going
to threaten me

1387
00:49:34,395 --> 00:49:35,350
do it properly.

1388
00:49:35,435 --> 00:49:37,426
Second of all, you're nuts
if you think kidnapping me

1389
00:49:37,515 --> 00:49:39,233
is going to help you cheat
your way to the top!

1390
00:49:39,315 --> 00:49:40,589
( chuckling evilly )

1391
00:49:40,675 --> 00:49:44,793
You still think this is about
that stupid scare record?

1392
00:49:44,875 --> 00:49:48,072
Well... I did, right up
until you chuckled like that

1393
00:49:48,155 --> 00:49:51,306
and now I'm thinking
I should just get out of here.

1394
00:49:51,395 --> 00:49:54,626
I am about to revolutionise
the scaring industry

1395
00:49:54,715 --> 00:49:57,832
and when I do, even
the great James P. Sullivan

1396
00:49:57,915 --> 00:49:59,394
is going to be
working for me.

1397
00:49:59,475 --> 00:50:00,351
MIKE:
Well

1398
00:50:00,435 --> 00:50:02,585
somebody's certainly
been a busy bee.

1399
00:50:02,675 --> 00:50:04,267
First, I need to know
where the kid is

1400
00:50:04,355 --> 00:50:05,504
and you're going
to tell me.

1401
00:50:05,595 --> 00:50:06,744
Yeah, I don't
know anything.

1402
00:50:06,835 --> 00:50:07,745
Uh-huh, sure.

1403
00:50:07,835 --> 00:50:08,711
MIKE:
I don't.

1404
00:50:08,795 --> 00:50:09,784
I mean, I don't.

1405
00:50:09,875 --> 00:50:11,194
Uh-oh.

1406
00:50:11,275 --> 00:50:12,594
( oechanical clanging
~ and grinding )

1407
00:50:12,675 --> 00:50:13,551
What's that?

1408
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:14,909
Come on.
Wait, wait, wait.

1409
00:50:14,995 --> 00:50:16,223
Oh-oh. Oh-oh.
Oh, come on.

1410
00:50:16,315 --> 00:50:17,191
No, no, no, no, no.

1411
00:50:17,275 --> 00:50:18,344
Come on,
hey, hey, hey.

1412
00:50:18,435 --> 00:50:20,073
This thing is moving.

1413
00:50:20,155 --> 00:50:22,066
I don't like big...

1414
00:50:22,155 --> 00:50:24,305
moving things that are
moving towards me.

1415
00:50:24,395 --> 00:50:25,669
No! Come on!

1416
00:50:25,755 --> 00:50:27,188
Hey, Randall!

1417
00:50:27,275 --> 00:50:30,312
Say hello
to the scream extractor.

1418
00:50:30,395 --> 00:50:32,272
Hello.

1419
00:50:32,355 --> 00:50:33,504
Come on,
where you going?

1420
00:50:33,595 --> 00:50:34,425
We'll talk.

1421
00:50:34,515 --> 00:50:35,584
Come on,
we'll have a latte!

1422
00:50:35,675 --> 00:50:36,664
Come on.

1423
00:50:36,755 --> 00:50:38,347
We can talk
about this.

1424
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:41,154
( electrical whirring starts,
~ then grows louder )

1425
00:50:41,235 --> 00:50:43,829
What's that thing?
What is that thing?

1426
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:45,030
Wait, wait, wait!

1427
00:50:45,115 --> 00:50:46,150
Stop, stop!

1428
00:50:46,235 --> 00:50:47,463
No, no!

1429
00:50:47,555 --> 00:50:48,465
Come on, hey!

1430
00:50:48,555 --> 00:50:49,988
( deep, resonating whirring )

1431
00:50:50,075 --> 00:50:51,667
Help! Help! Help!

1432
00:50:51,755 --> 00:50:52,665
Help!

1433
00:50:52,755 --> 00:50:54,666
( yelling )

1434
00:50:57,515 --> 00:50:58,914
( noise dies away )

1435
00:50:58,995 --> 00:50:59,950
Oh, for...

1436
00:51:00,035 --> 00:51:01,309
What did you
do wrong this time?

1437
00:51:01,395 --> 00:51:02,384
I don't know.

1438
00:51:02,475 --> 00:51:03,624
I calibrated the drive...

1439
00:51:03,715 --> 00:51:04,989
Go check the machine!

1440
00:51:05,075 --> 00:51:07,225
There must be something wrong
with the scream intake valve.

1441
00:51:07,315 --> 00:51:09,829
That's the problem
with these 3250 units...

1442
00:51:09,915 --> 00:51:11,826
Huh?

1443
00:51:14,595 --> 00:51:16,551
Hmm.

1444
00:51:26,388 --> 00:51:27,616
Psst!

1445
00:51:27,708 --> 00:51:28,982
Fungus.
Fungus.

1446
00:51:29,068 --> 00:51:31,059
You like cars, huh?

1447
00:51:31,148 --> 00:51:32,547
'Cause I got a really nice car.

1448
00:51:32,628 --> 00:51:34,858
If you let me go,
I'll give you...

1449
00:51:34,948 --> 00:51:36,176
a ride in the car.

1450
00:51:36,268 --> 00:51:37,542
Please, Fungus?

1451
00:51:37,628 --> 00:51:39,220
I'm sorry, Wazowski,
but Randall said

1452
00:51:39,308 --> 00:51:42,027
I'm not allowed to fraternize
with victims of his evil plot.

1453
00:51:42,108 --> 00:51:43,063
( gasps )

1454
00:51:43,148 --> 00:51:44,467
( clanging )

1455
00:51:44,548 --> 00:51:45,822
Hmm...

1456
00:51:46,788 --> 00:51:47,664
( zapping )

1457
00:51:47,748 --> 00:51:49,739
( electrical whirring )

1458
00:51:49,828 --> 00:51:52,820
( clanking, rattling, whirring )

1459
00:51:52,908 --> 00:51:53,784
( gasps )

1460
00:51:53,868 --> 00:51:54,744
( ouffled screaos )

1461
00:51:54,828 --> 00:51:55,544
What happened?

1462
00:51:55,628 --> 00:51:57,266
Where's Wazowski?

1463
00:51:57,348 --> 00:51:58,940
( ouffled screaos )

1464
00:51:59,028 --> 00:52:00,780
( shuts off oachine )

1465
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:02,062
Where is he?!

1466
00:52:02,148 --> 00:52:03,706
( whiopering )

1467
00:52:03,788 --> 00:52:04,857
( growls )

1468
00:52:04,948 --> 00:52:06,097
( whiopering )

1469
00:52:06,188 --> 00:52:07,223
( squeals )

1470
00:52:07,308 --> 00:52:08,457
Come on!

1471
00:52:08,548 --> 00:52:09,981
This is crazy.
He's going to kill us!

1472
00:52:10,068 --> 00:52:12,104
CD A AGENT:
Careful.
That could be contaminated.

1473
00:52:12,188 --> 00:52:13,667
We got to get out of here now!

1474
00:52:13,748 --> 00:52:16,137
We can start a whole new life
somewhere far away.

1475
00:52:16,228 --> 00:52:17,422
Goodbye, Monsters, Inc.!

1476
00:52:17,508 --> 00:52:19,226
Goodbye, Mr Waternoose!

1477
00:52:19,308 --> 00:52:20,627
No, Mike, wait!

1478
00:52:20,708 --> 00:52:22,027
Hey, what are you doing?

1479
00:52:22,108 --> 00:52:23,461
Follow me. I have an idea.

1480
00:52:23,548 --> 00:52:26,267
No! No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no...

1481
00:52:26,348 --> 00:52:28,339
COMPUTER VOICE ( over P.A. ):
Simulation terminated.

1482
00:52:28,428 --> 00:52:29,577
WATERNOOSE:
No, no, no, no, no.

1483
00:52:29,668 --> 00:52:30,703
What was that?

1484
00:52:30,788 --> 00:52:33,427
You're trying to scare the kid,
not lull it to sleep.

1485
00:52:33,508 --> 00:52:36,341
I was going for a
snake/ ninja approach

1486
00:52:36,428 --> 00:52:37,656
with a little hissing.

1487
00:52:37,748 --> 00:52:38,624
( hisses )

1488
00:52:38,708 --> 00:52:41,017
How many times
do I have to tell you?

1489
00:52:41,108 --> 00:52:42,621
It's all about presence!

1490
00:52:42,708 --> 00:52:44,585
About how you enter the room!

1491
00:52:44,668 --> 00:52:46,101
Mr Waternoose!

1492
00:52:46,188 --> 00:52:47,985
James! Perfect timing.

1493
00:52:48,068 --> 00:52:49,467
No, no. Sir, you
don't understand.

1494
00:52:49,548 --> 00:52:51,379
Ah, now, show these monsters
how it's done.

1495
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:52,344
What? No, no,
I can't...

1496
00:52:52,428 --> 00:52:53,338
Sir...
sir, you have

1497
00:52:53,428 --> 00:52:54,304
to listen to me.

1498
00:52:54,388 --> 00:52:55,377
Pay attention, everyone.

1499
00:52:55,468 --> 00:52:56,344
You're about to see

1500
00:52:56,428 --> 00:52:57,747
the best in the business.

1501
00:52:57,828 --> 00:52:58,704
Reset the simulator.

1502
00:52:58,788 --> 00:52:59,664
But-but, sir!

1503
00:52:59,748 --> 00:53:00,976
MOTHER:
Good night, sweetheart.

1504
00:53:01,068 --> 00:53:02,342
ANIMATRONIC BO Y:
Night, Mom.

1505
00:53:02,428 --> 00:53:03,304
Kitty!

1506
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:04,423
No, Boo, no, no!

1507
00:53:04,508 --> 00:53:06,066
Now, give us a big, loud roar.

1508
00:53:06,148 --> 00:53:07,820
Mr Waternoose,
there's no time for this.

1509
00:53:07,908 --> 00:53:09,500
Come on. What are you
waiting for? Roar!

1510
00:53:09,588 --> 00:53:10,464
But-but-but, sir!

1511
00:53:10,548 --> 00:53:11,264
Roar!

1512
00:53:11,348 --> 00:53:12,542
( groans )

1513
00:53:12,628 --> 00:53:13,822
( roaring ferociously )

1514
00:53:13,908 --> 00:53:15,341
( shrieking in terror )

1515
00:53:15,428 --> 00:53:16,907
( gasps )

1516
00:53:16,988 --> 00:53:18,023
( roaring ferociously )

1517
00:53:18,108 --> 00:53:19,097
( squeals )

1518
00:53:19,188 --> 00:53:21,383
( Boo crying )

1519
00:53:21,468 --> 00:53:22,423
( students applauding )

1520
00:53:22,508 --> 00:53:23,418
WATERNOOSE:
Well done.

1521
00:53:23,508 --> 00:53:25,146
Well done,James.

1522
00:53:25,228 --> 00:53:26,661
Boo?

1523
00:53:26,748 --> 00:53:29,262
-All right, gentlemen,
I hope you've learned...
-Right this way, everyone.

1524
00:53:29,348 --> 00:53:30,906
...a valuable lesson
in scaring today.

1525
00:53:30,988 --> 00:53:32,341
( fearful whioper )

1526
00:53:32,428 --> 00:53:33,577
( whines softly )

1527
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:35,021
Boo.

1528
00:53:35,108 --> 00:53:36,507
( nervous grunt )

1529
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:38,385
( whining )

1530
00:53:39,388 --> 00:53:40,616
Boo?

1531
00:53:41,588 --> 00:53:43,704
( panicked grunts )

1532
00:53:43,788 --> 00:53:44,903
( door slaos )

1533
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:47,627
Boo, it's me.

1534
00:53:47,708 --> 00:53:48,823
( squealing )

1535
00:53:49,788 --> 00:53:51,221
( gasps ):
The child!

1536
00:53:51,308 --> 00:53:52,263
Sir, she isn't toxic.

1537
00:53:52,348 --> 00:53:54,145
I know it sounds
crazy, but trust me.

1538
00:53:54,228 --> 00:53:55,104
Boo?

1539
00:53:55,188 --> 00:53:56,223
No, no, no, no.

1540
00:53:56,308 --> 00:53:57,184
It's okay.

1541
00:53:57,268 --> 00:53:58,337
I was just...

1542
00:53:58,428 --> 00:53:59,463
( whiopering in fear )

1543
00:53:59,548 --> 00:54:01,345
No, no, no, no, no,
don't be scared.

1544
00:54:01,428 --> 00:54:03,066
That wasn't real.

1545
00:54:03,148 --> 00:54:04,263
It's just a...

1546
00:54:04,348 --> 00:54:05,383
I was just...

1547
00:54:05,468 --> 00:54:06,696
( crying ):
No...

1548
00:54:08,948 --> 00:54:10,904
( Boo continues crying )

1549
00:54:15,868 --> 00:54:17,187
( Boo sobbing )

1550
00:54:17,268 --> 00:54:18,462
Boo.

1551
00:54:18,548 --> 00:54:20,061
MIKE:
...and he was going
to test it out

1552
00:54:20,148 --> 00:54:22,025
on that sweet,
little girl.

1553
00:54:22,108 --> 00:54:23,826
Boo.
Now that we
have her...

1554
00:54:23,908 --> 00:54:25,057
...he is trying
to kill us.

1555
00:54:25,148 --> 00:54:26,740
This whole thing
is Randall's fault.

1556
00:54:26,828 --> 00:54:28,056
Randall?

1557
00:54:28,148 --> 00:54:30,457
Yes. And we can take
you to his secret lab,
which is right here

1558
00:54:30,548 --> 00:54:31,424
in this factory.

1559
00:54:31,508 --> 00:54:32,702
How could this happen?

1560
00:54:32,788 --> 00:54:34,585
Oh, how could this happen?

1561
00:54:34,668 --> 00:54:36,704
Does anyone else
know about this?

1562
00:54:36,788 --> 00:54:37,664
No, sir.

1563
00:54:37,748 --> 00:54:39,067
Good.

1564
00:54:39,148 --> 00:54:41,901
This company can't afford
any more bad publicity.

1565
00:54:41,988 --> 00:54:45,981
Now, before we do
anything else, let's...

1566
00:54:46,068 --> 00:54:48,298
take care of the child.

1567
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:54,864
Oh, I never thought things
would come to this...

1568
00:54:54,948 --> 00:54:57,746
not in my factory.

1569
00:54:57,828 --> 00:55:00,900
I'm sorry you boys
got mixed up in this.

1570
00:55:00,988 --> 00:55:02,421
Especially you,James.

1571
00:55:02,508 --> 00:55:04,146
But now we can set

1572
00:55:04,228 --> 00:55:07,538
everything straight again
for the good of the company.

1573
00:55:07,628 --> 00:55:08,663
( whirring )

1574
00:55:08,748 --> 00:55:10,101
( thunk )

1575
00:55:10,188 --> 00:55:11,223
MIKE:
Uh...

1576
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:13,424
sir, that's not her door.

1577
00:55:13,508 --> 00:55:15,021
I know, I know.

1578
00:55:17,868 --> 00:55:18,903
It's yours.

1579
00:55:18,988 --> 00:55:19,977
( startled gasps )

1580
00:55:20,068 --> 00:55:21,057
( grunts )

1581
00:55:21,148 --> 00:55:23,264
( yelling )

1582
00:55:23,348 --> 00:55:24,144
No!

1583
00:55:25,268 --> 00:55:26,496
( gasps )

1584
00:55:26,588 --> 00:55:30,547
( voice echoing ):
Boo!

1585
00:55:33,548 --> 00:55:34,503
( gasps )

1586
00:55:34,588 --> 00:55:35,543
No! No!

1587
00:55:35,628 --> 00:55:37,505
No! No! No! No!

1588
00:55:37,588 --> 00:55:38,543
No!

1589
00:55:38,628 --> 00:55:39,822
( desperate grunts )

1590
00:55:39,908 --> 00:55:40,818
It's too late!

1591
00:55:40,908 --> 00:55:42,421
We're banished, genius.

1592
00:55:42,508 --> 00:55:44,260
We're in the human world!

1593
00:55:44,348 --> 00:55:47,545
Oh, what a great idea, going
to your old pal Waternoose!

1594
00:55:47,628 --> 00:55:49,698
Too bad he was in
on the whole thing!

1595
00:55:49,788 --> 00:55:53,303
All you had to do was listen
to me--just once!

1596
00:55:53,388 --> 00:55:55,458
But you didn't, did you?

1597
00:55:55,548 --> 00:55:57,903
You're still not listening!

1598
00:55:57,988 --> 00:56:00,661
( yelling )

1599
00:56:00,748 --> 00:56:04,787
( Sulley grunting and groaning )

1600
00:56:04,868 --> 00:56:05,903
Take that!

1601
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:07,580
( growling )

1602
00:56:07,668 --> 00:56:09,226
( gasps in horror )

1603
00:56:11,828 --> 00:56:14,137
Welcome to the Himalayas!

1604
00:56:14,228 --> 00:56:16,458
( wind gusting )

1605
00:56:16,548 --> 00:56:18,061
''Abominable''!

1606
00:56:18,148 --> 00:56:19,024
( chuckles )

1607
00:56:19,108 --> 00:56:20,302
Can you believe that?

1608
00:56:20,388 --> 00:56:22,106
Do I look abominable to you?

1609
00:56:22,188 --> 00:56:24,986
Why can't they call me
the Adorable Snowman or...

1610
00:56:25,068 --> 00:56:27,787
or the Agreeable Snowman,
for crying out loud?

1611
00:56:27,868 --> 00:56:29,096
I'm a nice guy.

1612
00:56:29,188 --> 00:56:30,382
Snow cone?

1613
00:56:30,468 --> 00:56:31,344
Yuck.

1614
00:56:31,428 --> 00:56:32,258
No, no, no.

1615
00:56:32,348 --> 00:56:33,861
Don't worry--
it's lemon.

1616
00:56:33,948 --> 00:56:35,984
Uh, how about
you, big fella?

1617
00:56:36,068 --> 00:56:38,138
Snow cone?

1618
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:42,619
Did you see the way she...
looked at me?

1619
00:56:42,708 --> 00:56:44,141
( sighs )

1620
00:56:44,228 --> 00:56:45,980
Ah, poor guy.

1621
00:56:46,068 --> 00:56:47,057
I understand.

1622
00:56:47,148 --> 00:56:48,740
It ain't easy
being banished.

1623
00:56:48,828 --> 00:56:50,022
Take my buddy, Bigfoot.

1624
00:56:50,108 --> 00:56:51,257
When he was banished

1625
00:56:51,348 --> 00:56:54,226
he fashioned an enormous diaper
out of poison ivy.

1626
00:56:54,308 --> 00:56:56,105
Wore it on his head
like a tiara.

1627
00:56:56,188 --> 00:56:57,667
Called himself King Itchy.

1628
00:56:57,748 --> 00:57:00,387
Ah, it won't be so hard for
you guys, though, you know.

1629
00:57:00,468 --> 00:57:01,821
I mean, how lucky
can you get?

1630
00:57:01,908 --> 00:57:03,341
Banished with your
best friend.

1631
00:57:03,428 --> 00:57:04,781
He is not my friend.

1632
00:57:04,868 --> 00:57:06,699
Oh. I just assumed you
were buddies, you know

1633
00:57:06,788 --> 00:57:08,267
when I saw you out
there in the snow

1634
00:57:08,348 --> 00:57:09,224
hugging and all that.

1635
00:57:09,308 --> 00:57:10,263
Look at that big jerk.

1636
00:57:10,348 --> 00:57:11,781
Ruined my life, and for what?

1637
00:57:11,868 --> 00:57:12,903
A stupid kid!

1638
00:57:12,988 --> 00:57:14,819
Because of you,
I am now stuck

1639
00:57:14,908 --> 00:57:16,341
in this frozen
wasteland!

1640
00:57:16,428 --> 00:57:17,338
Wasteland?

1641
00:57:17,428 --> 00:57:19,783
I think you mean wonderland!

1642
00:57:19,868 --> 00:57:22,177
I mean, how about
all this fabulous snow, huh?

1643
00:57:22,268 --> 00:57:24,657
Oh, and wait till you see
the local village.

1644
00:57:24,748 --> 00:57:26,261
Cutest thing in the world.

1645
00:57:26,348 --> 00:57:28,578
I haven't even mentioned
all the free yak's milk.

1646
00:57:28,668 --> 00:57:30,101
What... what did you say?

1647
00:57:30,188 --> 00:57:31,064
Yak's milk.

1648
00:57:31,148 --> 00:57:32,786
Milking a yak
ain't exactly a picnic.

1649
00:57:32,868 --> 00:57:34,506
You know, once you pick
the hairs out

1650
00:57:34,588 --> 00:57:35,543
it's very nutritious.

1651
00:57:35,628 --> 00:57:37,425
No, no. Something
about a village.

1652
00:57:37,508 --> 00:57:38,623
Where?
Are there kids in it?

1653
00:57:38,708 --> 00:57:39,618
Kids? Sure.

1654
00:57:39,708 --> 00:57:41,426
Tough kids, sissy kids,
kids who climb on rocks...

1655
00:57:41,508 --> 00:57:42,384
Where is it?!

1656
00:57:42,468 --> 00:57:43,787
It's at the bottom
of the mountain.

1657
00:57:43,868 --> 00:57:44,937
Around a three-day hike.

1658
00:57:45,028 --> 00:57:46,222
Oh, three days?!

1659
00:57:46,308 --> 00:57:47,627
We need to get there now!

1660
00:57:47,708 --> 00:57:49,824
( thuop )

1661
00:57:51,588 --> 00:57:52,543
( ding )

1662
00:57:58,228 --> 00:57:59,980
You want to go to the village?

1663
00:58:00,068 --> 00:58:02,104
Okay, rule number one
out here.

1664
00:58:02,188 --> 00:58:03,177
Always...

1665
00:58:03,268 --> 00:58:04,337
No.

1666
00:58:04,428 --> 00:58:06,578
Never go out in a blizzard.

1667
00:58:06,668 --> 00:58:08,226
We need to get to Boo.

1668
00:58:08,308 --> 00:58:09,661
( grunts, then gasps )

1669
00:58:09,748 --> 00:58:11,466
Boo?!

1670
00:58:11,548 --> 00:58:12,867
What about us?

1671
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:13,824
( grunts )

1672
00:58:13,908 --> 00:58:15,500
Ever since that kid
came in

1673
00:58:15,588 --> 00:58:16,907
you've ignored
everything I've said

1674
00:58:16,988 --> 00:58:18,137
and now look where we are!

1675
00:58:19,188 --> 00:58:21,622
Oh, we were about
to break the record, Sulley.

1676
00:58:21,708 --> 00:58:23,141
We would have had it made!

1677
00:58:23,228 --> 00:58:24,343
None of that matters now.

1678
00:58:24,428 --> 00:58:26,817
None of it matter...

1679
00:58:26,908 --> 00:58:28,023
Wa-wait a second.

1680
00:58:28,108 --> 00:58:30,224
None of it matters?

1681
00:58:30,308 --> 00:58:31,787
( sighs )

1682
00:58:31,868 --> 00:58:33,187
MIKE:
Okay.

1683
00:58:33,268 --> 00:58:35,179
That's.... no. Good. Great.

1684
00:58:35,268 --> 00:58:37,828
So, now the truth
comes out, doesn't it?

1685
00:58:37,908 --> 00:58:40,980
Oh, would you
look at that?

1686
00:58:41,068 --> 00:58:42,786
We're out of
snow cones, uh...

1687
00:58:42,868 --> 00:58:44,426
Let me... just go outside

1688
00:58:44,508 --> 00:58:45,657
and make some more.

1689
00:58:45,748 --> 00:58:50,026
Sulley, what about everything
we ever worked for?

1690
00:58:50,108 --> 00:58:53,180
Does that matter?
Huh?

1691
00:58:53,268 --> 00:58:55,099
And what about Celia?

1692
00:58:55,188 --> 00:58:58,783
I am never... never
going to see her again.

1693
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:00,347
Doesn't that matter?

1694
00:59:03,628 --> 00:59:04,583
( sighs )

1695
00:59:05,788 --> 00:59:07,187
What about me?

1696
00:59:07,268 --> 00:59:08,781
I'm your pal.

1697
00:59:08,868 --> 00:59:10,824
I'm... I'm your best friend.

1698
00:59:10,908 --> 00:59:12,944
Don't I matter?

1699
00:59:14,708 --> 00:59:16,141
( sighs )

1700
00:59:16,228 --> 00:59:17,263
I'm sorry, Mike.

1701
00:59:17,348 --> 00:59:20,146
I'm sorry we're stuck out here.

1702
00:59:20,228 --> 00:59:22,298
I didn't mean
for this to happen.

1703
00:59:22,388 --> 00:59:23,946
But Boo's in trouble.

1704
00:59:24,028 --> 00:59:25,780
I think there might
be a way to save her

1705
00:59:25,868 --> 00:59:27,381
if we can just
get down to that...

1706
00:59:27,468 --> 00:59:28,344
''We''?

1707
00:59:28,428 --> 00:59:30,146
Whoa, whoa, whoa. ''We''?

1708
00:59:30,228 --> 00:59:31,422
No.

1709
00:59:31,508 --> 00:59:33,339
There's no ''we'' this time, pal.

1710
00:59:33,428 --> 00:59:35,623
I-if-if you want
to go out there

1711
00:59:35,708 --> 00:59:36,902
and freeze to death

1712
00:59:36,988 --> 00:59:39,263
you be my guest...

1713
00:59:39,348 --> 00:59:42,181
because you're on your own.

1714
01:00:04,308 --> 01:00:07,664
( wind whistles )

1715
01:00:17,468 --> 01:00:19,982
Hey, I got more snow cones!

1716
01:00:25,028 --> 01:00:25,938
Ohh!

1717
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:31,623
Ahh!

1718
01:00:38,348 --> 01:00:38,780
Ahh!

1719
01:00:38,868 --> 01:00:39,744
( yells )

1720
01:00:39,828 --> 01:00:42,820
( grunting and groaning )

1721
01:00:46,268 --> 01:00:49,146
( wind howling )

1722
01:00:51,548 --> 01:00:54,745
( distant child screaoing )

1723
01:00:58,748 --> 01:01:01,660
( children screaoing )

1724
01:01:04,988 --> 01:01:06,421
Oh, come on, now, George.

1725
01:01:06,508 --> 01:01:08,066
I know you can do this.

1726
01:01:08,148 --> 01:01:11,140
I picked out an easy door
for you-- in Nepal.

1727
01:01:11,228 --> 01:01:13,219
Nice, quiet Nepal.

1728
01:01:13,308 --> 01:01:14,900
You know, you're right.

1729
01:01:14,988 --> 01:01:16,137
Here, take this.

1730
01:01:16,228 --> 01:01:17,786
Go get 'em, Georgie!

1731
01:01:17,868 --> 01:01:19,506
Gangway! Look out!
Coming through!

1732
01:01:19,588 --> 01:01:20,782
Sorry, George.

1733
01:01:20,868 --> 01:01:22,142
Hey, you can't just...

1734
01:01:22,228 --> 01:01:23,104
( gasps )

1735
01:01:23,188 --> 01:01:24,018
23...

1736
01:01:24,108 --> 01:01:25,746
( gagging )

1737
01:01:28,708 --> 01:01:29,857
( whistling )

1738
01:01:29,948 --> 01:01:31,063
Out of the way!

1739
01:01:31,148 --> 01:01:32,024
-Hey!
-Whoa!

1740
01:01:32,108 --> 01:01:33,507
Don't!

1741
01:01:33,588 --> 01:01:35,146
( gasps )

1742
01:01:35,228 --> 01:01:36,217
( whiopers )

1743
01:01:36,308 --> 01:01:37,502
Finally!

1744
01:01:37,588 --> 01:01:39,704
I never should have
trusted you with this.

1745
01:01:39,788 --> 01:01:42,097
Because of you, I had
to banish my top scarer!

1746
01:01:42,188 --> 01:01:44,418
With this machine,
we won't need scarers.

1747
01:01:44,508 --> 01:01:46,658
Besides, Sullivan got
what he deserved.

1748
01:01:46,748 --> 01:01:49,626
Sullivan was twice the scarer
you will ever be!

1749
01:01:49,708 --> 01:01:50,618
( low growl )

1750
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:51,777
( panting )

1751
01:01:51,868 --> 01:01:52,744
( clanging )

1752
01:01:52,828 --> 01:01:54,022
( grunting )

1753
01:01:54,108 --> 01:01:55,382
( yells with effort )

1754
01:01:57,148 --> 01:02:00,345
( oechanical whirring )

1755
01:02:00,428 --> 01:02:01,941
( gasps )

1756
01:02:02,028 --> 01:02:04,178
Kitty!

1757
01:02:04,268 --> 01:02:05,303
( whirring and hissing )

1758
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:06,946
( yelling )

1759
01:02:07,028 --> 01:02:08,256
( shrieking )

1760
01:02:08,348 --> 01:02:09,463
( roaring )

1761
01:02:11,068 --> 01:02:11,864
Kitty!

1762
01:02:11,948 --> 01:02:12,539
Sullivan?

1763
01:02:12,628 --> 01:02:13,856
( grunting )

1764
01:02:16,588 --> 01:02:18,465
Wh-whoa!

1765
01:02:18,548 --> 01:02:19,742
Kitty!

1766
01:02:19,828 --> 01:02:20,897
Sorry, Boo.

1767
01:02:20,988 --> 01:02:22,262
Stop him!

1768
01:02:22,348 --> 01:02:23,383
( growls )

1769
01:02:23,468 --> 01:02:25,823
Let's get you home.

1770
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:26,465
( panting )

1771
01:02:26,548 --> 01:02:27,424
( blow lands )

1772
01:02:27,508 --> 01:02:28,384
Ooh!

1773
01:02:28,468 --> 01:02:29,742
WATERNOOSE:
Finish him off!

1774
01:02:29,828 --> 01:02:30,738
Oh! Ooh! Oh!

1775
01:02:30,828 --> 01:02:32,659
( clanging )

1776
01:02:33,948 --> 01:02:34,903
( thunk )

1777
01:02:36,428 --> 01:02:37,941
You don't know how long

1778
01:02:38,028 --> 01:02:40,701
I've wanted to do
that, Sullivan.

1779
01:02:40,788 --> 01:02:41,664
( grunts )

1780
01:02:41,748 --> 01:02:43,147
( chuckles )

1781
01:02:43,228 --> 01:02:45,139
( punches landing )

1782
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:46,138
Hah!

1783
01:02:46,228 --> 01:02:46,944
Ooh!

1784
01:02:47,028 --> 01:02:48,256
( shrieks )

1785
01:02:49,668 --> 01:02:51,306
( panting )

1786
01:02:51,388 --> 01:02:52,298
Ooh!

1787
01:02:52,388 --> 01:02:53,298
Mike?!

1788
01:02:53,388 --> 01:02:55,060
Look, it's not that I
don't care about the kid.

1789
01:02:55,148 --> 01:02:56,376
Mike, you don't
understand.

1790
01:02:56,468 --> 01:02:58,140
Yes, I do. I was
just mad, that's all.

1791
01:02:58,228 --> 01:02:59,502
I needed some time to think.

1792
01:02:59,588 --> 01:03:01,465
But you shouldn't
have left me out there.

1793
01:03:01,548 --> 01:03:02,458
( thuop )

1794
01:03:02,548 --> 01:03:03,867
I'm being attacked!

1795
01:03:03,948 --> 01:03:05,142
No, I'm not attacking you.

1796
01:03:05,228 --> 01:03:06,297
I'm trying to be honest.

1797
01:03:06,388 --> 01:03:07,264
Just hear me out.

1798
01:03:07,348 --> 01:03:08,497
You and I are a team.

1799
01:03:08,588 --> 01:03:11,102
Nothing is more important
than our friendship.

1800
01:03:11,188 --> 01:03:12,064
I-I-I know, kid.

1801
01:03:12,148 --> 01:03:13,263
He's too sensitive.

1802
01:03:13,348 --> 01:03:14,827
( gagging )

1803
01:03:14,908 --> 01:03:15,624
( whining cry )

1804
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:16,982
Come on, pal.

1805
01:03:17,068 --> 01:03:18,626
If you start crying,
I'm going to cry

1806
01:03:18,708 --> 01:03:20,061
and I'll never get through this.

1807
01:03:20,148 --> 01:03:22,537
I'm sorry
I wasn't there for you

1808
01:03:22,628 --> 01:03:23,504
but I am now.

1809
01:03:23,588 --> 01:03:24,338
Ow!

1810
01:03:24,428 --> 01:03:25,781
Sulley, I am baring
my soul here.

1811
01:03:25,868 --> 01:03:27,859
The least you could do
is pay attention!

1812
01:03:28,868 --> 01:03:30,381
( yells in pain )

1813
01:03:30,468 --> 01:03:32,345
( sighs in relief )

1814
01:03:32,428 --> 01:03:34,544
Hey, look at that--
it's Randall! It's...

1815
01:03:34,628 --> 01:03:35,458
Oh.

1816
01:03:35,548 --> 01:03:36,742
Come on!

1817
01:03:36,828 --> 01:03:38,022
WATERNOOSE:
Get up!

1818
01:03:38,108 --> 01:03:39,905
There can't be
any witnesses.

1819
01:03:39,988 --> 01:03:41,137
There won't be.

1820
01:03:41,228 --> 01:03:42,661
I'm glad you came back, Mike.

1821
01:03:42,748 --> 01:03:45,137
Somebody's gotta take care
of you, you big hair ball.

1822
01:03:45,228 --> 01:03:46,138
( Celia screaoing )

1823
01:03:46,228 --> 01:03:47,786
( screaoing )

1824
01:03:47,868 --> 01:03:48,744
Ow!

1825
01:03:48,828 --> 01:03:50,705
Schmoopsie-poo,
I really can't talk.

1826
01:03:50,788 --> 01:03:51,743
Come on!

1827
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,261
Michael, if you
don't tell me

1828
01:03:53,348 --> 01:03:55,464
what's going on right
now, we are through!

1829
01:03:55,548 --> 01:03:56,617
You hear me? Through!

1830
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:57,777
Here's the truth.

1831
01:03:57,868 --> 01:03:59,506
You know the kid that they're
looking for-- Sulley let her in.

1832
01:03:59,588 --> 01:04:00,498
We tried to
send her back

1833
01:04:00,588 --> 01:04:01,782
but Waternoose
had this secret plot

1834
01:04:01,868 --> 01:04:04,177
and now Randall's right behind
us and he's trying to kill us!

1835
01:04:04,268 --> 01:04:07,385
You expect me to believe that
pack of lies, Mike Wazowski?!

1836
01:04:07,468 --> 01:04:08,696
Mike Wazowski!

1837

( startled yell )

1838
01:04:10,028 --> 01:04:11,347
I love you, Schmoopsie-poo!

Move it! Look out, you...

1840

Oh!

1844
01:04:18,068 --> 01:04:19,183
Make way. Move it!

1845
01:04:19,268 --> 01:04:20,462
Hurry up. Hurry up.

1849
01:04:28,028 --> 01:04:28,904
Huh?

1850
01:04:28,988 --> 01:04:29,864
No, I didn't.

1851
01:04:29,948 --> 01:04:30,983
Get out of my way!

1852

Get off my tail!

1857
01:04:37,308 --> 01:04:38,423
Let me through!

1858
01:04:42,232 --> 01:04:43,221
Sulley,
what are you doing?

1859
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:44,188
Grab on, Mike!

1860
01:04:44,272 --> 01:04:45,307

MIKE:
Sulley, what are we doing?

1865
01:04:56,032 --> 01:04:59,069
We have to get Boo's door
and find a station.

1866
01:04:59,152 --> 01:05:02,542
MIKE:
What a plan--
simple, yet insane!

( growls )

1868
01:05:04,712 --> 01:05:05,986

1874
01:05:25,832 --> 01:05:26,628
Wow!

1875
01:05:26,712 --> 01:05:27,622
Don't look down!

1876
01:05:29,312 --> 01:05:30,381

How are we supposed
to get it now?

That's right, Boo.

2000
01:10:06,272 --> 01:10:07,307
You did it.

2001
01:10:07,392 --> 01:10:08,427
You beat him.

01:10:12,952 --> 01:10:14,988
Okay, Boo,
it's time to go home.

2005
01:10:15,072 --> 01:10:17,222
Take care of yourself,
and be a good girl, okay?

2006
01:10:17,312 --> 01:10:18,347
( gasps )

2007
01:10:18,432 --> 01:10:19,421
Oh, no!

2008
01:10:19,512 --> 01:10:20,388
The power's out!

2009
01:10:20,472 --> 01:10:21,825
Make her laugh again.

2010
01:10:21,912 --> 01:10:23,106
All right, I got a move here.

2011
01:10:23,192 --> 01:10:24,386
It'll bring down the house.

2012
01:10:24,472 --> 01:10:25,541
Up...

2013
01:10:25,632 --> 01:10:26,667
( oetallic clang )

2014
01:10:26,752 --> 01:10:27,787
( groans softly )

2015
01:10:27,872 --> 01:10:30,102
Oh, sorry, she didn't see that.

2016
01:10:30,192 --> 01:10:31,625
What?! What'd you do,
forget to check

2017
01:10:31,712 --> 01:10:32,701
if her stupid hood was up

2018
01:10:32,792 --> 01:10:33,861
ya big dope?!

2019
01:10:33,952 --> 01:10:36,147
( singsong ):
Uncle Mike, try not to yell
in front of her.

2020
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:37,665
You know we still need her
to laugh.

2021
01:10:37,752 --> 01:10:38,628
Right.

2022
01:10:38,712 --> 01:10:39,588
( laughs )

2023
01:10:39,672 --> 01:10:41,230
Hey, Boo, just kidding. Look!

2024
01:10:41,312 --> 01:10:42,188
( gibberish )

2025
01:10:42,272 --> 01:10:43,705
Funny, right? Huh?
See what the...

2026
01:10:43,792 --> 01:10:44,861
These are the jokes, kid.

2027
01:10:44,952 --> 01:10:45,987
Whoa!

2028
01:10:46,072 --> 01:10:47,710
What's happening?

2029
01:10:47,792 --> 01:10:50,022
SULLEY:
Hold on!

2030
01:10:50,112 --> 01:10:52,990
When the door lands
in this station, cut the power.

2031
01:10:53,072 --> 01:10:56,064
You'll have the child
and the criminals responsible

2032
01:10:56,152 --> 01:10:58,427
for this whole mess.

2033
01:10:58,512 --> 01:11:00,389
Great.
A welcoming committee!

2034
01:11:00,472 --> 01:11:02,144
What are we going to do?!

2035
01:11:02,232 --> 01:11:05,747
( electrical huooing )

2036
01:11:08,072 --> 01:11:09,505
( clang )

2037
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:14,387
This is the CD A.

2038
01:11:14,472 --> 01:11:15,507
Come out slowly

2039
01:11:15,592 --> 01:11:17,105
with the child
in plain sight.

2040
01:11:17,192 --> 01:11:19,342
Okay, okay.

2041
01:11:19,432 --> 01:11:20,308
You got us.

2042
01:11:20,392 --> 01:11:21,381
Here we are.

2043
01:11:21,472 --> 01:11:22,382
Here's the kid.

2044
01:11:22,472 --> 01:11:23,905
I'm cooperating.

2045
01:11:23,992 --> 01:11:25,789
But before you take us away,
I have one thing to say:

2046
01:11:25,872 --> 01:11:26,748
( gags )

2047
01:11:26,832 --> 01:11:28,106
Catch!

2048
01:11:28,192 --> 01:11:30,023
( all shouting ):
231 9!

2049
01:11:30,112 --> 01:11:31,704
We have a toxic
projectile!

2050
01:11:31,792 --> 01:11:33,350
Halt! After the suspect!

2051
01:11:33,432 --> 01:11:34,785
Cover the area!
Bring in reinforcements!

2052
01:11:34,872 --> 01:11:36,271
WATERNOOSE:
Stop him!

2053
01:11:36,352 --> 01:11:38,866
( Boo squeaks )

2054
01:11:38,952 --> 01:11:40,021
Come on.

2055
01:11:40,112 --> 01:11:42,228
Don't let them get away.

2056
01:11:42,312 --> 01:11:43,188
What...?!

2057
01:11:43,272 --> 01:11:44,307
No, wait, wait!

2058
01:11:44,392 --> 01:11:45,950
Come back!
He has the child!

2059
01:11:46,032 --> 01:11:47,226
( frustrated growl )

2060
01:11:49,312 --> 01:11:50,984
( Boo squeaks )

2061
01:11:51,072 --> 01:11:53,461
Sullivan? Sullivan!

2062
01:11:53,552 --> 01:11:55,031
Give me the child!

2063
01:11:55,112 --> 01:11:56,227
Me not go!

2064
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:57,188
Give her to me!

2065
01:11:58,352 --> 01:12:00,422
( panting )

2066
01:12:00,512 --> 01:12:01,945
( grunts )

2067
01:12:03,752 --> 01:12:05,549
( oetallic creaking )

2068
01:12:05,632 --> 01:12:09,830
WATERNOOSE:
Open this door!
Open this door!

2069
01:12:09,912 --> 01:12:11,504
( growling and pounding )

2070
01:12:11,592 --> 01:12:13,310
Hey!

2071
01:12:13,392 --> 01:12:14,791
Sullivan!

2072
01:12:14,872 --> 01:12:15,702
( yells )

2073
01:12:15,792 --> 01:12:17,464
WATERNOOSE:
Don't do it.

2074
01:12:17,552 --> 01:12:18,223
( beep )

2075
01:12:18,312 --> 01:12:18,983
Come on.

2076
01:12:19,072 --> 01:12:21,950
Don't go in that room!

2077
01:12:22,032 --> 01:12:23,545
( yelling )

2078
01:12:23,632 --> 01:12:25,827
I think we stopped him, Boo.

2079
01:12:25,912 --> 01:12:26,947
You're safe now.

2080
01:12:27,032 --> 01:12:30,104
You be a good girl, okay?

2081
01:12:30,192 --> 01:12:32,581
This has gone
far enough,James.

2082
01:12:32,672 --> 01:12:33,900
She's home now!
Just leave her alone!

2083
01:12:33,992 --> 01:12:35,027
I can't do that!

2084
01:12:35,112 --> 01:12:36,147
She's seen too much.

2085
01:12:36,232 --> 01:12:37,790
You both have.

2086
01:12:37,872 --> 01:12:39,271
It doesn't have to be this way.

2087
01:12:39,352 --> 01:12:40,865
I have no choice!

2088
01:12:40,952 --> 01:12:41,941
Times have changed.

2089
01:12:42,032 --> 01:12:43,545
Scaring isn't enough any more.

2090
01:12:43,632 --> 01:12:44,985
But kidnapping children?!

2091
01:12:45,072 --> 01:12:46,585
I'll kidnap
a thousand children

2092
01:12:46,672 --> 01:12:48,025
before I let
this company die

2093
01:12:48,112 --> 01:12:49,784
and I'll silence anyone

2094
01:12:49,872 --> 01:12:51,624
who gets in my way!

2095
01:12:51,712 --> 01:12:52,940
No!

2096
01:12:53,032 --> 01:12:55,182
( child's voice ):
Good night, Mom.

2097
01:12:55,272 --> 01:12:56,864
( wooan's voice ):
Good night, sweetheart.

2098
01:12:56,952 --> 01:12:57,828
Good night, Mom.

2099
01:12:57,912 --> 01:13:00,062
What, wh-what is this?!
What? Who? Huh?

2100
01:13:00,152 --> 01:13:02,427
COMPUTER:
Simulation terminated.
Simulation terminated.

2101
01:13:02,512 --> 01:13:04,343
Well, I don't know
about the rest of you guys

2102
01:13:04,432 --> 01:13:06,229
but I spotted
several big mistakes.

2103
01:13:06,312 --> 01:13:07,745
But-but-but how-how did...?
How did...?

2104
01:13:07,832 --> 01:13:08,867
MIKE:
You know what?

2105
01:13:08,952 --> 01:13:11,591
Let's watch my favourite part
again... shall we?

2106
01:13:11,672 --> 01:13:14,664
( repeating ):
I'll kidnap a thousand children
before I let this company die.

2107
01:13:14,752 --> 01:13:16,504
What...? Wha...?

2108
01:13:16,592 --> 01:13:18,503
I'll kidnap
a thousand children before...

2109
01:13:18,592 --> 01:13:19,866
( baby talk )

2110
01:13:19,952 --> 01:13:21,305
Shh, shh, shh, shh!

2111
01:13:21,392 --> 01:13:22,791
Shh!

2112
01:13:22,872 --> 01:13:23,748
I'll get him.

2113
01:13:23,832 --> 01:13:24,867
All right,
come with us, sir.

2114
01:13:24,952 --> 01:13:26,021
Wh-what are
you doing?

2115
01:13:26,112 --> 01:13:26,988
Take your
hands off me!

2116
01:13:27,072 --> 01:13:28,107
You can't arrest me!

2117
01:13:28,192 --> 01:13:29,307
I hope you're happy, Sullivan!

2118
01:13:29,392 --> 01:13:31,587
You've destroyed this company.
Monsters, Incorporated is dead!

2119
01:13:31,672 --> 01:13:34,186
Where will everyone
get their scream now?!

2120
01:13:34,272 --> 01:13:36,422
The energy crisis
will only get worse

2121
01:13:36,512 --> 01:13:38,025
because of you!

2122
01:13:38,112 --> 01:13:39,340
( loud clang )

2123
01:13:41,032 --> 01:13:43,182
Stay where you are.

2124
01:13:43,272 --> 01:13:44,102
Huh?

2125
01:13:44,192 --> 01:13:45,511
Number One
wants to talk to you.

2126
01:13:45,592 --> 01:13:47,628
Attention!

2127
01:13:53,392 --> 01:13:55,303
Hello, boys.

2128
01:13:55,392 --> 01:13:56,302
BOTH:
Roz?!

2129
01:13:56,392 --> 01:14:00,146
Two and a half years
of undercover work

2130
01:14:00,232 --> 01:14:02,063
were almost wasted

2131
01:14:02,152 --> 01:14:05,588
when you intercepted
that child, Mr Sullivan.

2132
01:14:05,672 --> 01:14:09,028
Of course, without your help,
I never would have known

2133
01:14:09,112 --> 01:14:11,831
that this went all the way up
to Waternoose.

2134
01:14:11,912 --> 01:14:13,584
( baby talk )

2135
01:14:13,672 --> 01:14:15,151
( gasps )

2136
01:14:15,232 --> 01:14:16,426
ROZ:
Now...

2137
01:14:16,512 --> 01:14:17,991
about the girl...

2138
01:14:18,072 --> 01:14:21,109
I just want to
send her home.

2139
01:14:21,192 --> 01:14:22,261
Very good.

2140
01:14:22,352 --> 01:14:23,387
( chioing tones )

2141
01:14:23,472 --> 01:14:25,064
Bring me a door shredder.

2142
01:14:25,152 --> 01:14:28,064
What, you mean... you mean,
I can't see her again?

2143
01:14:28,152 --> 01:14:31,383
That's the way it has to be.

2144
01:14:31,472 --> 01:14:34,430
I'll give you
five minutes.

2145
01:14:39,312 --> 01:14:40,586
( whirring huo )

2146
01:14:44,592 --> 01:14:46,150
Well, so long, kid.

2147
01:14:46,232 --> 01:14:48,029
Mike Wazowski!

2148
01:14:48,112 --> 01:14:49,465
Yeah.

2149
01:14:49,552 --> 01:14:54,580
Ah, Boo,
it's been fun.

2150
01:14:54,672 --> 01:14:55,866
Go ahead.

2151
01:14:55,952 --> 01:14:58,341
Go grow up.

2152
01:15:04,152 --> 01:15:06,108
( door creaking )

2153
01:15:08,672 --> 01:15:10,822
( squealing in delight )

2154
01:15:10,912 --> 01:15:12,027
( laughing )

2155
01:15:16,312 --> 01:15:17,188
Uh-uh, B-Boo...?

2156
01:15:17,272 --> 01:15:18,148
( speaking baby talk )

2157
01:15:18,232 --> 01:15:19,267
Um... Boo?

2158
01:15:19,352 --> 01:15:20,705
( speaking baby talk )

2159
01:15:20,792 --> 01:15:21,827
Oh, look at that.

2160
01:15:21,912 --> 01:15:24,062
Yeah, you know...

2161
01:15:24,152 --> 01:15:25,824
Oh, that's cute, yeah.

2162
01:15:25,912 --> 01:15:26,901
( baby talk )

2163
01:15:26,992 --> 01:15:28,061
Uh, Boo, um...

2164
01:15:28,152 --> 01:15:29,062
( squeaking toy )

2165
01:15:29,152 --> 01:15:30,505
Well, that's very nice.

2166
01:15:30,592 --> 01:15:32,264
( giggling )

2167
01:15:32,352 --> 01:15:33,626
Come here, you!

2168
01:15:33,712 --> 01:15:34,940
( squeals )

2169
01:15:35,032 --> 01:15:36,988
( both laughing )

2170
01:15:41,512 --> 01:15:44,151
Oh, he's a happy bear...

2171
01:15:44,232 --> 01:15:45,711
( giggling )

2172
01:15:45,792 --> 01:15:47,828
( baby talk )

2173
01:15:49,592 --> 01:15:51,344
Nothing's coming
out of your closet

2174
01:15:51,432 --> 01:15:52,831
to scare you
any more, right?

2175
01:15:52,912 --> 01:15:53,981
Mm...

2176
01:15:54,072 --> 01:15:56,381
Yeah.

2177
01:15:56,472 --> 01:15:58,827
Goodbye, Boo.

2178
01:15:58,912 --> 01:16:01,346
Kitty.

2179
01:16:01,432 --> 01:16:03,502
Kitty has to go.

2180
01:16:42,192 --> 01:16:44,262
Boo!

2181
01:16:44,352 --> 01:16:46,502
( gasps )

2182
01:16:46,592 --> 01:16:49,470
Kitty?

2183
01:16:49,552 --> 01:16:51,827
( ootor buzzing loudly )

2184
01:16:55,232 --> 01:16:56,426
( clicks off )

2185
01:16:56,512 --> 01:16:57,786
None of this

2186
01:16:57,872 --> 01:17:00,670
ever happened, gentlemen.

2187
01:17:00,752 --> 01:17:05,268
And I don't want to see
any paperwork on this.

2188
01:17:07,592 --> 01:17:09,662
( door closes )

2189
01:17:25,992 --> 01:17:28,028
Take him away.

2190
01:17:28,112 --> 01:17:29,943
( all ourouring )

2191
01:17:30,032 --> 01:17:31,863
I bet we get
the rest of the day off.

2192
01:17:31,952 --> 01:17:32,987
You idiot!

2193
01:17:33,072 --> 01:17:35,063
They're going
to shut down the factory!

2194
01:17:35,152 --> 01:17:36,744
( all gasp )

2195
01:17:36,832 --> 01:17:38,788
I'm telling you, pal,
when that wall went up

2196
01:17:38,872 --> 01:17:41,227
you should have seen the look
on Waternoose's face.

2197
01:17:41,312 --> 01:17:43,382
Whoo-hoo! I hope we get
a copy of that tape.

2198
01:17:43,472 --> 01:17:44,541
Hey, you all right?

2199
01:17:44,632 --> 01:17:46,623
Come on, pal,
cheer up, we did it!

2200
01:17:46,712 --> 01:17:47,701
We got Boo home.

2201
01:17:47,792 --> 01:17:50,022
Ah, sure, we put the factory
in the toilet, and...

2202
01:17:50,112 --> 01:17:52,342
gee, hundreds of people
will be out of work now.

2203
01:17:52,432 --> 01:17:54,662
Not to mention the angry mob
that'll come after us

2204
01:17:54,752 --> 01:17:56,549
when there's no more power,
but, hey...

2205
01:17:56,632 --> 01:17:59,510
at least we had
some laughs, right?

2206
01:18:01,592 --> 01:18:04,311
Laughs...

2207
01:18:04,392 --> 01:18:05,541
( crickets chirping )

2208
01:18:05,632 --> 01:18:07,304
( wind blowing softly )

2209
01:18:07,392 --> 01:18:10,031
( door quietly creaks open )

2210
01:18:19,272 --> 01:18:20,421
( boy gasps )

2211
01:18:22,872 --> 01:18:24,271
Hey, is this thing on?
Hello?

2212
01:18:24,352 --> 01:18:25,944
Hello?
Testing, testing.

2213
01:18:26,032 --> 01:18:27,351
Hey, good evening.
How are you?

2214
01:18:27,432 --> 01:18:28,660
How are you?
Nice to see you.

2215
01:18:28,752 --> 01:18:30,663
I tell you, it's good
to be here in... your room.

2216
01:18:30,752 --> 01:18:31,821
Where you from?

2217
01:18:31,912 --> 01:18:33,061
Never mind.

2218
01:18:33,152 --> 01:18:35,063
You're in
kindergarten, right?

2219
01:18:35,152 --> 01:18:36,187
Oh, I love kindergarten.

2220
01:18:36,272 --> 01:18:37,944
Best three years of my life.

2221
01:18:38,912 --> 01:18:40,231
Of my life.

2222
01:18:40,312 --> 01:18:41,188
But I love sports.

2223
01:18:41,272 --> 01:18:42,466
Dodgeball was the best.

2224
01:18:42,552 --> 01:18:43,428
Oh, yeah.

2225
01:18:43,512 --> 01:18:44,865
I was the fastest one out there.

2226
01:18:44,952 --> 01:18:46,510
Course I was the ball.

2227
01:18:46,592 --> 01:18:48,230
But I...

2228
01:18:48,312 --> 01:18:49,745
was the ball, see?

2229
01:18:49,832 --> 01:18:51,424
All right.

2230
01:18:55,472 --> 01:18:56,985
( ruobling )

2231
01:18:57,072 --> 01:18:58,505
( ruobling gets louder )

2232
01:18:58,592 --> 01:18:59,707
( gurgling )

2233
01:18:59,792 --> 01:19:01,623
Ah...

2234
01:19:01,712 --> 01:19:02,827
( huge burp )

2235
01:19:02,912 --> 01:19:03,981
Ah?

2236
01:19:04,072 --> 01:19:05,505
( laughing )

2237
01:19:05,592 --> 01:19:06,707
Hey, thanks a lot.

2238
01:19:06,792 --> 01:19:07,861
I'll be here all week.

2239
01:19:07,952 --> 01:19:09,544
Remember to tip your waitresses.

2240
01:19:09,632 --> 01:19:11,270
( guffawing )

2241
01:19:11,352 --> 01:19:12,626
( rippling gurgle )

2242
01:19:12,712 --> 01:19:13,861
( bell dings )

2243
01:19:13,952 --> 01:19:15,180
Great job, Mikey.

2244
01:19:15,272 --> 01:19:17,388
You filled your quota on
the first kid of the day.

2245
01:19:17,472 --> 01:19:18,461
Not bad, huh?

2246
01:19:18,552 --> 01:19:20,622
You know, only somebody
with perfect comedic timing

2247
01:19:20,712 --> 01:19:22,384
could produce this much energy
in one shot.

2248
01:19:22,472 --> 01:19:23,905
Uh-huh, and the fact
that laughter is

2249
01:19:23,992 --> 01:19:25,425
ten times more
powerful than scream

2250
01:19:25,512 --> 01:19:26,547
had nothing to do with it.

2251
01:19:26,632 --> 01:19:27,621
( clears throat )

2252
01:19:27,712 --> 01:19:28,940
CELIA:
Oh, Googley Bear.

2253
01:19:29,032 --> 01:19:31,227
Come here, you.

2254
01:19:31,312 --> 01:19:32,188
Schmoopsie-poo!

2255
01:19:32,272 --> 01:19:33,182
Googley.

2256
01:19:33,272 --> 01:19:34,261
Whoa!

2257
01:19:34,352 --> 01:19:35,387
( snakes chittering )

2258
01:19:35,472 --> 01:19:36,507
( Mike giggling )

2259
01:19:36,592 --> 01:19:37,547
Girls!
Girls, put...

2260
01:19:37,632 --> 01:19:39,748
Stop, stop, stop!

2261
01:19:39,832 --> 01:19:42,027
Michael,
you're such a charmer.

2262
01:19:42,112 --> 01:19:43,340
Hey, did you bring
the magazine?

2263
01:19:43,432 --> 01:19:44,660
They just delivered
a whole box.

2264
01:19:44,752 --> 01:19:45,628
Let me see it!

2265
01:19:45,712 --> 01:19:46,781
( laughing )

2266
01:19:46,872 --> 01:19:48,271
Sulley and I
made the cover, right?

2267
01:19:48,352 --> 01:19:51,503
( whispering ):
I don't believe it.

2268
01:19:51,592 --> 01:19:53,105
( syopathetically ):
~Googley Bear...

2269
01:19:53,192 --> 01:19:56,389
I'm on the cover
of a magazine!

2270
01:19:56,472 --> 01:19:57,825
Ow!

2271
01:19:57,912 --> 01:19:59,186
( chattering )

2272
01:20:00,632 --> 01:20:02,145
( jittering blubbers )

2273
01:20:02,232 --> 01:20:04,223
Oh, this is great!

2274
01:20:04,312 --> 01:20:06,587
( huooing happily )

2275
01:20:06,672 --> 01:20:08,390
( child laughing uproariously )

2276
01:20:08,472 --> 01:20:09,461
( bell dings )

2277
01:20:09,552 --> 01:20:12,225
Oh.

2278
01:20:14,872 --> 01:20:17,102
( distant laughter )

2279
01:20:17,192 --> 01:20:18,511
( kazoo whirs )

2280
01:20:18,592 --> 01:20:20,423
( toy horn toots )

2281
01:20:29,552 --> 01:20:30,587
MIKE:
Hey, Sulley!

2282
01:20:30,672 --> 01:20:31,787
( yells )

2283
01:20:31,872 --> 01:20:32,941
Hey, uh, Mike.
I was, uh, just...

2284
01:20:33,032 --> 01:20:34,101
Well, listen,
if you got a minute

2285
01:20:34,192 --> 01:20:35,420
there's something
I want to show you.

2286
01:20:35,512 --> 01:20:36,388
But-but-but...

2287
01:20:36,472 --> 01:20:37,348
Okay, close your eyes.

2288
01:20:37,432 --> 01:20:38,421
Follow me.
Come on.

2289
01:20:38,512 --> 01:20:39,388
I-I-I...

2290
01:20:39,472 --> 01:20:40,541
No peeking.

2291
01:20:40,632 --> 01:20:42,065
Keep coming,
keep coming,
keep coming.

2292
01:20:42,152 --> 01:20:43,187
Come on,
keep coming.

2293
01:20:43,272 --> 01:20:44,307
Keep coming,
keep coming.

2294
01:20:44,392 --> 01:20:45,427
Mike...

2295
01:20:45,512 --> 01:20:46,945
Follow the sultry
sound of my voice.

2296
01:20:47,032 --> 01:20:47,908
Okay, stop.

2297
01:20:47,992 --> 01:20:48,947
Open them.

2298
01:20:50,112 --> 01:20:51,750
Ta-da!

2299
01:20:51,832 --> 01:20:53,470
Mike...

2300
01:20:53,552 --> 01:20:54,701
is that...?

2301
01:20:54,792 --> 01:20:55,986
Sorry it took

2302
01:20:56,072 --> 01:20:57,107
so long, pal.

2303
01:20:57,192 --> 01:20:59,501
It was a lot of wood
to go through.

2304
01:20:59,592 --> 01:21:01,071
You know,
it only works

2305
01:21:01,152 --> 01:21:03,108
if you have
every piece.

2306
01:21:15,872 --> 01:21:17,624
( whirring huo )

2307
01:21:26,512 --> 01:21:28,787
( creaking )

2308
01:21:28,872 --> 01:21:30,863
Boo?

2309
01:21:30,952 --> 01:21:32,670
BOO:
Kitty!

2310
01:21:40,996 --> 01:21:43,271
( bouncy blues oelody plays )

2311
01:21:43,356 --> 01:21:44,425
-Speed.
-Marker.

2312
01:21:44,516 --> 01:21:45,505
And... action.

2313
01:21:45,596 --> 01:21:49,191
SULLEY:
If I were a rich man

2314
01:21:49,276 --> 01:21:53,030
With a million or two

2315
01:21:53,116 --> 01:21:55,949
MIKE:
I'd live in
a penthouse

2316
01:21:56,036 --> 01:22:00,393
In a room
with a view

2317
01:22:00,476 --> 01:22:02,148
And if I were handsome

2318
01:22:02,236 --> 01:22:03,112
No way.

2319
01:22:03,196 --> 01:22:04,345
It could happen.

2320
01:22:04,436 --> 01:22:08,395
Those dreams
do come true

2321
01:22:08,476 --> 01:22:12,389
I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have you

2322
01:22:12,476 --> 01:22:16,151
Wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have

2323
01:22:16,236 --> 01:22:19,706
Wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have

2324
01:22:19,796 --> 01:22:22,390
Wouldn't have nothing...

2325
01:22:22,476 --> 01:22:23,465
( giggling )

2326
01:22:23,556 --> 01:22:24,466
DIRECTOR:
Okay, cut.

2327
01:22:24,556 --> 01:22:27,150
( flushing )

2328
01:22:27,236 --> 01:22:29,386
Okay, you finished
now, right?

2329
01:22:29,476 --> 01:22:30,352
Hello?

2330
01:22:30,436 --> 01:22:31,312
Hello.

2331
01:22:31,396 --> 01:22:32,272
( yells )

2332
01:22:32,356 --> 01:22:33,311
( laughs )

2333
01:22:33,396 --> 01:22:34,988
( both laugh )

2334
01:22:35,076 --> 01:22:36,145
Come on, get lost, you two.

2335
01:22:36,236 --> 01:22:37,555
You're making him
lose his focus.

2336
01:22:37,636 --> 01:22:38,512
Oh, sorry.

2337
01:22:38,596 --> 01:22:39,790
See you later, fellas.

2338
01:22:39,876 --> 01:22:40,911
Go get 'em, Mr Solomon.

2339
01:22:40,996 --> 01:22:41,872
You idiot!

2340
01:22:41,956 --> 01:22:42,945
It's Sullivan, not Solomon!

2341
01:22:43,036 --> 01:22:43,912
What?

2342
01:22:43,996 --> 01:22:44,906
You're messing up the scene!

2343
01:22:44,996 --> 01:22:45,872
Sorry.

2344
01:22:45,956 --> 01:22:47,355
We're never going to work
in Hollywood again!

2345
01:22:47,436 --> 01:22:48,312
Let me do it over.

2346
01:22:48,396 --> 01:22:49,272
Shut up!

2347
01:22:49,356 --> 01:22:50,232
Keep rolling!

2348
01:22:50,316 --> 01:22:51,226
You're making it worse!

2349
01:22:51,316 --> 01:22:53,352
JERRY:
Duck and cover, people!

2350
01:22:56,036 --> 01:22:58,630
( squeaking )

2351
01:22:58,716 --> 01:22:59,626
Hey, thanks, guys.

2352
01:22:59,716 --> 01:23:00,865
That was a close one.

2353
01:23:00,956 --> 01:23:06,030
( yelling )

2354
01:23:06,116 --> 01:23:08,186
Ta-da!

2355
01:23:08,276 --> 01:23:10,949
( all laughing )

2356
01:23:11,036 --> 01:23:13,709
Oh, Boo, it's been fun.

2357
01:23:16,076 --> 01:23:17,304
Go ahead.

2358
01:23:17,396 --> 01:23:19,148
Go throw up.

2359
01:23:19,236 --> 01:23:20,146
( Boo giggles )

2360
01:23:20,236 --> 01:23:21,669
What?
What did I say?

2361
01:23:21,756 --> 01:23:22,632
What? What?

2362
01:23:22,716 --> 01:23:23,671
Cut.

2363
01:23:25,316 --> 01:23:26,192
Hey, Ted!

2364
01:23:26,276 --> 01:23:27,231
Good morning!

2365
01:23:27,316 --> 01:23:28,351
( unrealistic roaring )

2366
01:23:28,436 --> 01:23:29,346
Cut.

2367
01:23:29,436 --> 01:23:30,789
Hey, how was that?
Was I scary?

2368
01:23:30,876 --> 01:23:31,786
Do I get the part?

2369
01:23:31,876 --> 01:23:32,786
Thank you.

2370
01:23:32,876 --> 01:23:33,786
Can I do it again?

2371
01:23:33,876 --> 01:23:34,786
I can be taller!

2372
01:23:34,876 --> 01:23:35,786
Next!

2373
01:23:35,876 --> 01:23:37,787
And action!

2374
01:23:37,876 --> 01:23:39,514
Okay, let's move.
Let's move, let's move!

2375
01:23:39,596 --> 01:23:40,472
( yelling )

2376
01:23:40,556 --> 01:23:41,432
( loud crash )

2377
01:23:41,516 --> 01:23:42,392
Ow!

2378
01:23:42,476 --> 01:23:43,670
( laughter )

2379
01:23:43,756 --> 01:23:46,395
Can we get a little more wax
on the floor, please?

2380
01:23:46,476 --> 01:23:47,386
Wait a minute.
Randall?

2381
01:23:47,476 --> 01:23:48,386
That cheater!

2382
01:23:48,476 --> 01:23:50,194
He's trying
to boost his numbers!

2383
01:23:50,276 --> 01:23:51,504
There's something else.

2384
01:23:51,596 --> 01:23:52,472
What?!

2385
01:23:52,556 --> 01:23:54,865
Look-lay in the bag-bay.

2386
01:23:54,956 --> 01:23:57,106
I think you mean
''Ook-lay in the ag-bay.''

2387
01:23:57,196 --> 01:23:58,265
What? Didn't I...?

2388
01:23:58,356 --> 01:24:00,153
Well, you know, maybe
you should just take a minute

2389
01:24:00,236 --> 01:24:01,191
and ead-ray
your ipt-scray.

2390
01:24:01,276 --> 01:24:02,152
( chuckles )

2391
01:24:02,236 --> 01:24:04,591
You think he's in going
to come through the closet

2392
01:24:04,676 --> 01:24:05,552
and scare you.

2393
01:24:05,636 --> 01:24:07,308
Oh, boy, how do I explain this?

2394
01:24:07,396 --> 01:24:08,545
Uh, it's empty.

2395
01:24:08,636 --> 01:24:09,625
See?

2396
01:24:09,716 --> 01:24:11,149
Guess who.

2397
01:24:11,236 --> 01:24:14,706
( laughter )

2398
01:24:14,796 --> 01:24:16,149
Action.

2399
01:24:20,756 --> 01:24:21,905
Hey, what's the...

2400
01:24:21,996 --> 01:24:22,985
( laughing )

2401
01:24:23,076 --> 01:24:24,031
( chuckles )

2402
01:24:24,116 --> 01:24:25,185
Okay, very funny.

2403
01:24:25,276 --> 01:24:27,073
Hey, I look good in a suit.

2404
01:24:27,156 --> 01:24:27,906
Marker.

2405
01:24:27,996 --> 01:24:28,985
And action.

2406
01:24:29,076 --> 01:24:30,953
Let her rip.

2407
01:24:31,036 --> 01:24:32,151
Go.

2408
01:24:32,236 --> 01:24:34,147
( loud whirring )

2409
01:24:34,236 --> 01:24:35,112
Whoa!

2410
01:24:35,196 --> 01:24:37,232
Shut it off!
Shut it off!

2411
01:24:37,316 --> 01:24:38,271
( yelling )

2412
01:24:38,356 --> 01:24:39,789
Pull the lever!

2413
01:24:39,876 --> 01:24:41,025
( yells )

2414
01:24:41,116 --> 01:24:43,186
You're making it worse!

2415
01:24:45,076 --> 01:24:48,193
MIKE:
But I must admit it

2416
01:24:48,276 --> 01:24:52,554
Big guy, you
always come through

2417
01:24:52,636 --> 01:24:57,630
I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have you

2418
01:24:59,836 --> 01:25:03,351
BOTH:
You and me together

2419
01:25:03,436 --> 01:25:07,065
That's how it
always should be

2420
01:25:07,156 --> 01:25:12,913
One without the other
don't mean nothing to me

2421
01:25:12,996 --> 01:25:15,669
Nothing to me...

2422
01:25:15,756 --> 01:25:16,745
Oh, hey!

2423
01:25:16,836 --> 01:25:19,396
We're rehearsing a scene

2424
01:25:19,476 --> 01:25:21,751

2427
01:25:24,076 --> 01:25:25,111
It's a musical!

01:25:32,596 --> 01:25:35,064
Or I'll poke myself
in the eye!

2433
01:25:35,156 --> 01:25:36,828
It's a work in progress.

2434
01:25:36,916 --> 01:25:38,588
It's gonna get better.

2435
01:25:41,356 --> 01:25:42,675
Ladies and gentlemen

2436
01:25:42,756 --> 01:25:45,589

01:25:49,876 --> 01:25:51,992
And produced

2441
01:25:52,076 --> 01:25:53,668
Oh.

2442
01:25:53,756 --> 01:25:54,666
( applause and cheers )

2443
01:25:54,756 --> 01:25:55,825

2444
01:25:55,916 --> 01:25:59,704

So help me

2450
01:26:06,836 --> 01:26:08,633
I just gotta cry...

2451
01:26:08,716 --> 01:26:10,547
Your seat is right
over there, sir.

2452
01:26:10,636 --> 01:26:12,069
Boo!

2453
01:26:12,156 --> 01:26:13,714
There's a child,
there's a child

2454
01:26:13,796 --> 01:26:14,945
There's a human child

2455
01:26:15,036 --> 01:26:15,912
Oh, no!

2456
01:26:15,996 --> 01:26:17,031
Running
'round the restaurant

2457
01:26:17,116 --> 01:26:17,992
This is really wild

2458
01:26:18,076 --> 01:26:18,952
( screaoing )

2459
01:26:19,036 --> 01:26:20,674
What in heaven's name
will become of us?

2460
01:26:20,756 --> 01:26:22,986
We who are living
in Monstropolis?

2461
01:26:23,076 --> 01:26:24,509
( tinkling crash )

2462
01:26:24,596 --> 01:26:26,393
( piano segues to ballad )

2463
01:26:26,476 --> 01:26:28,228
All right, Wazowski.

2464
01:26:28,316 --> 01:26:30,625
Tell us where the kid is.

2465
01:26:30,716 --> 01:26:32,354
( booing and hissing )

2466
01:26:32,436 --> 01:26:34,154
I will never talk!

2467
01:26:34,236 --> 01:26:35,191
Never!

2468
01:26:37,556 --> 01:26:40,548
She's out of our hair

2469
01:26:40,636 --> 01:26:42,592
( light applause and whistles )

2470
01:26:42,676 --> 01:26:47,511
And just when I dare...
to care

2471
01:26:47,596 --> 01:26:50,793
She says, ''au contraire''

2472
01:26:50,876 --> 01:26:54,869
You're my pair...
of friends

2473
01:26:54,956 --> 01:26:55,866
I love you.

2474
01:26:55,956 --> 01:26:56,911
( sobbing loudly )

2475
01:26:56,996 --> 01:26:58,475
Keep it together, man!

2476
01:26:58,556 --> 01:27:05,075
And so we put that kid
back where she came from

2477
01:27:05,156 --> 01:27:07,909
And she helped us to find

2478
01:27:07,996 --> 01:27:14,231
A better tomorrow today!

2479
01:27:14,316 --> 01:27:15,669
Thank you!

2480
01:27:15,756 --> 01:27:17,951
What a night for my mother
to be in the audience!

2481
01:27:18,036 --> 01:27:18,912
Ladies and gentlemen

2482
01:27:18,996 --> 01:27:19,872
my mom!

2483
01:27:19,956 --> 01:27:22,072
( whistling loudly )

2484
01:27:22,156 --> 01:27:25,148
Thank you, Monstropolis!

2485
01:27:25,236 --> 01:27:27,909
BOTH:
I don't have to say it

2486
01:27:27,996 --> 01:27:29,031
SULLEY:
Ah, say it anyway.

2487
01:27:29,116 --> 01:27:29,992
MIKE:
'Cause we...

2488
01:27:30,076 --> 01:27:32,590
Both know it's true

2489
01:27:32,676 --> 01:27:37,192
I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have

2490
01:27:37,276 --> 01:27:40,791
I wouldn't have
nothing if I didn't have

2491
01:27:40,876 --> 01:27:44,994
I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have you

2492
01:27:45,076 --> 01:27:51,106
Wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have you.

2493
01:27:51,196 --> 01:27:52,072
( ousic ends )

2494
01:27:52,156 --> 01:27:54,033
One more time.

2495
01:27:54,116 --> 01:27:55,788
( ousic begins again )

2496
01:27:55,876 --> 01:27:56,752
It worked!

2497
01:27:56,836 --> 01:27:58,474
I don't have to say it

2498
01:27:58,556 --> 01:27:59,830
I'm gonna anyway!

2499
01:27:59,916 --> 01:28:01,907
'Cause we both
know it's true

2500
01:28:01,996 --> 01:28:03,827
Let's take it
home, big guy.

2501
01:28:03,916 --> 01:28:07,829
BOTH:
I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have

2502
01:28:07,916 --> 01:28:11,306
I wouldn't have
nothing if I didn't have

2503
01:28:11,396 --> 01:28:15,548
I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have you

2504
01:28:15,636 --> 01:28:17,228
You, you

2505
01:28:17,316 --> 01:28:18,305
A, E, I, O...

2506
01:28:18,396 --> 01:28:20,352
That means you, yeah.

2507
01:28:20,436 --> 01:28:21,630
( ousic ends )
