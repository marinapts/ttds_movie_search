1
00:50:24,537 --> 00:50:26,471
- In the bag.
- In the bag.

2
00:50:27,139 --> 00:50:28,766
You're quite a guy!

3
00:50:29,208 --> 00:50:30,607
So am I.

4
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:34,709
We sure impressed that ambassador.

5
00:50:36,215 --> 00:50:37,705
He's been taken in.

6
00:50:38,784 --> 00:50:41,685
More champagne!
That's what we need.

7
00:50:42,087 --> 00:50:44,180
The way we suckered him...

8
00:50:45,491 --> 00:50:48,517
What are you doing?
What's the matter with you?

9
00:50:49,228 --> 00:50:52,254
We told you to drive carefully.
We're important people.

10
00:50:52,364 --> 00:50:56,027
Hell yes! Extremely important people.

11
00:50:56,368 --> 00:50:58,359
If you only knew what's in this case.

12
00:50:58,537 --> 00:51:00,004
Don't you tell him.

13
00:51:00,472 --> 00:51:02,963
The Cameroon ambassador
wants to see us in the morning.

14
00:51:03,142 --> 00:51:03,972
In one piece.

15
00:51:04,076 --> 00:51:07,102
And you drive like a lizard,
first left, then right.

16
00:51:07,213 --> 00:51:08,874
You think you're in your jungle here?

17
00:51:10,082 --> 00:51:13,381
We're not from the same
jungle, are we? No.

18
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:14,916
Drive carefully.

19
00:51:15,154 --> 00:51:19,352
These little brothers who come to
France, don't they have any respect?

20
00:51:19,491 --> 00:51:22,051
Did you even hear him say hello?

21
00:51:22,261 --> 00:51:24,889
Little brother, where do you
come from that you're so rude?

22
00:51:26,165 --> 00:51:26,893
You from Togo?

23
00:51:27,533 --> 00:51:28,500
From Gabon?

24
00:51:29,435 --> 00:51:32,370
You can't be from Cameroon.
From Dakar?

25
00:51:32,471 --> 00:51:35,269
Wait, I'll have a closer look.

26
00:51:36,609 --> 00:51:38,577
If his looks don't kill you.

27
00:51:38,711 --> 00:51:40,508
With that face he might.

28
00:51:51,624 --> 00:51:52,682
I'll tell you.

29
00:51:52,791 --> 00:51:54,281
With a face like that,

30
00:51:54,426 --> 00:51:56,917
he must be a representative
of King Beyanzed.

31
00:51:58,330 --> 00:51:59,592
You're killing me.

32
00:52:00,499 --> 00:52:01,625
It's true!

33
00:52:01,767 --> 00:52:03,667
That's a Beninese's face!

34
00:52:03,769 --> 00:52:05,737
That's it. Benin.

35
00:52:07,506 --> 00:52:08,370
Little brother,

36
00:52:09,475 --> 00:52:10,703
are you from Benin?

37
00:52:13,412 --> 00:52:14,572
The lvory Coast.

38
00:52:17,516 --> 00:52:19,074
Ivory Coast.

39
00:52:20,152 --> 00:52:22,017
He's an Ivoirien.

40
00:52:24,823 --> 00:52:26,450
"Can't see a thing!"

41
00:52:26,592 --> 00:52:27,957
That explains it!

42
00:52:28,127 --> 00:52:30,254
He's an "Y voit rien. "

43
00:52:31,363 --> 00:52:34,230
You've run four red lights,

44
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:37,393
you can't see a thing, and you drive
at night without your glasses on.

45
00:52:39,505 --> 00:52:42,133
Don't leave your glasses at home!
Keep your eyes on the road.

46
00:52:42,508 --> 00:52:44,942
Look! The road is over there!

47
00:52:45,444 --> 00:52:48,436
Who gives these people cars?
An Ivoirien!

48
00:52:51,183 --> 00:52:54,175
What do you mean, "that explains it"?

49
00:52:57,723 --> 00:53:01,921
I work from 8:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m.,
so don't fuck with me in my own taxi.

50
00:53:02,361 --> 00:53:04,488
And I don't give a shit
about your ambassador, okay?

51
00:53:05,164 --> 00:53:08,156
Can't we have some fun?

52
00:53:08,967 --> 00:53:11,492
We've had champagne,
we're very happy...

53
00:53:11,637 --> 00:53:14,663
No, you don't have fun in my taxi.
I work in this taxi.

54
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:18,139
It's my place of business,
not your fucking playground!

55
00:53:18,744 --> 00:53:20,109
Okay, get out.

56
00:53:20,312 --> 00:53:21,279
What do you mean?

57
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:23,280
Just get out of my taxi.

58
00:53:23,382 --> 00:53:25,782
Little brother, I only said...

59
00:53:25,918 --> 00:53:27,180
Forget it. Just get out.

60
00:53:28,654 --> 00:53:29,678
Out of my taxi!

61
00:53:29,822 --> 00:53:32,017
But it's 4:00 in the morning.

62
00:53:34,993 --> 00:53:36,654
Little brother, what's wrong with you?

63
00:53:36,829 --> 00:53:38,558
Look where you're leaving us!

64
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:44,164
Can you believe this guy?

65
00:53:44,269 --> 00:53:46,294
Does he expect us to find a taxi here?

66
00:53:51,543 --> 00:53:53,534
What a fucked-up day.

67
00:54:02,588 --> 00:54:04,419
Big brothers, my ass...

68
00:54:06,291 --> 00:54:09,488
Shit, they didn't even pay!

69
00:54:09,595 --> 00:54:11,563
I can't believe this shit.

70
00:54:21,607 --> 00:54:23,074
I'll kick your ass.

71
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,870
Here's one that won't give me any shit.

72
00:55:10,956 --> 00:55:13,447
Nice driving, asshole.
You almost flattened me.

73
00:55:26,805 --> 00:55:27,931
What are we waiting for?

74
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,167
Quai de l'Oise,
near Porte de la Villette.

75
00:55:30,476 --> 00:55:31,807
It's near the canal.

76
00:55:50,762 --> 00:55:52,889
At the next intersection

77
00:55:53,031 --> 00:55:55,966
just follow Canal St. Martin
up to Stalingrad Place

78
00:55:56,068 --> 00:55:57,899
then along Quai de la Seine.

79
00:55:58,403 --> 00:56:01,839
Look, I know my job.
Don't tell me how to do my job.

80
00:56:09,781 --> 00:56:13,410
IF YOU HAVE A PREFERRED ROUTE,
lNDlCATE THlS TO THE DRlVER

81
00:56:17,155 --> 00:56:20,454
Doesn't this sign say
to follow my directions?

82
00:56:57,996 --> 00:57:00,089
Did you change something?

83
00:57:00,933 --> 00:57:02,901
What, me? Nothing!

84
00:57:16,048 --> 00:57:19,176
Don't they teach you how to drive
before unleashing you?

85
00:58:07,165 --> 00:58:08,757
What are we doing in this tunnel?

86
00:58:09,301 --> 00:58:12,828
Why'd you take the fucking tunnel?
I didn't tell you to go this way!

87
00:58:17,876 --> 00:58:19,605
I hate the tunnel.

88
00:58:33,025 --> 00:58:34,652
Hold still. I got it.

89
00:59:19,337 --> 00:59:22,033
Hey, don't blind people
usually wear dark glasses?

90
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:25,940
Do they? I wouldn't know.
I've never seen a blind person.

91
00:59:35,153 --> 00:59:36,848
You've always been blind?

92
00:59:37,255 --> 00:59:38,347
Yeah.

93
00:59:45,931 --> 00:59:48,126
Must be a real drag being blind, huh?

94
00:59:48,233 --> 00:59:50,827
Listen, jerk-off.
I can do anything you can

95
00:59:50,936 --> 00:59:52,665
and a lot of things you'll never do.

96
00:59:52,871 --> 00:59:54,463
I'm blind, that's all.

97
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:57,868
You can't drive a car, for example.

98
00:59:58,043 --> 00:59:59,635
And you can?

99
01:00:09,421 --> 01:00:11,082
I didn't mean to make you mad.

100
01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:14,852
I don't know any blind people.
I'm curious, that's all.

101
01:00:15,227 --> 01:00:19,493
I'm just like you.
I drink, I eat, I taste things.

102
01:00:20,999 --> 01:00:24,196
I listen to music.
I feel music.

103
01:00:25,137 --> 01:00:27,697
I do whatever I want.
I even go to the movies.

104
01:00:30,142 --> 01:00:31,404
The movies?

105
01:00:33,044 --> 01:00:34,773
And what do you see at the movies?

106
01:00:37,449 --> 01:00:39,110
Sometimes I feel the film.

107
01:00:40,819 --> 01:00:41,751
I can hear it.

108
01:00:43,121 --> 01:00:45,248
Oh, forget it.
You're a pain in the ass.

109
01:00:47,793 --> 01:00:50,591
Yeah, but when you eat,
you can't see the food.

110
01:00:51,296 --> 01:00:54,356
The carrots could be blue,
for example.

111
01:00:55,834 --> 01:00:58,098
And with music,
you can't see the musicians!

112
01:00:58,270 --> 01:01:00,363
You don't even know
the shape of a guitar.

113
01:01:00,472 --> 01:01:03,066
Yes I know the shape
of a fucking guitar.

114
01:01:03,208 --> 01:01:05,574
I feel things I'm sure you never will.

115
01:01:20,158 --> 01:01:24,424
Okay then, if you're so smart,
let me ask you a question.

116
01:01:26,298 --> 01:01:28,232
Here's the question.

117
01:01:29,034 --> 01:01:30,592
What color am l?

118
01:01:30,969 --> 01:01:32,903
I don't give a fuck about colors.

119
01:01:34,105 --> 01:01:36,699
But people have different
colors of skin!

120
01:01:36,808 --> 01:01:41,302
Look, I don't care if you're
green or... blue like a carrot.

121
01:01:41,446 --> 01:01:43,812
For me the word color
doesn't mean anything.

122
01:01:44,182 --> 01:01:45,581
I feel colors.

123
01:01:46,785 --> 01:01:48,582
But you'd never understand that.

124
01:01:59,798 --> 01:02:02,289
Okay. You hear my voice, my accent.

125
01:02:03,034 --> 01:02:04,331
Tell me where I'm from.

126
01:02:06,071 --> 01:02:08,835
And if I'm right I win a color TV,
is that it?

127
01:02:11,376 --> 01:02:13,173
I don't know, Africa.

128
01:02:16,214 --> 01:02:17,374
From Cameroon.

129
01:02:18,884 --> 01:02:20,146
No, the lvory Coast.

130
01:02:23,355 --> 01:02:24,219
Not bad!

131
01:02:25,790 --> 01:02:28,486
You're exactly right! Treichville.

132
01:03:33,291 --> 01:03:35,418
Can I ask you something personal?

133
01:03:36,061 --> 01:03:37,528
What now?

134
01:03:42,934 --> 01:03:44,765
What's it like in bed?

135
01:03:45,637 --> 01:03:47,070
What in bed?

136
01:03:49,507 --> 01:03:53,944
With a man, if you can't see anything,
when you make love,

137
01:03:55,313 --> 01:03:58,111
how do you know who's next to you,

138
01:04:00,585 --> 01:04:03,076
who you're making love with?

139
01:04:07,025 --> 01:04:10,461
Listen, when I make love
it's with every centimeter of my body,

140
01:04:10,595 --> 01:04:13,723
every pore of my skin.
Unlike you, I'm sure.

141
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,532
Believe me, I know the man
I make love with.

142
01:04:19,404 --> 01:04:21,770
Even when he's on the stairs,
I know it's him.

143
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,574
I can smell him from a block away.

144
01:04:26,578 --> 01:04:29,240
A block away!
He must really stink.

145
01:04:30,015 --> 01:04:30,947
Fuck you.

146
01:04:31,249 --> 01:04:34,480
I'm glad I can't see you,
'cause you must be an ugly bastard.

147
01:04:36,187 --> 01:04:37,279
That's right.

148
01:05:27,672 --> 01:05:29,162
Is this Quai de l'Oise?

149
01:05:30,742 --> 01:05:31,868
Which side?

150
01:05:33,211 --> 01:05:35,611
West of the canal,
facing Porte de la Villette.

151
01:05:36,681 --> 01:05:37,613
How much is it?

152
01:05:41,319 --> 01:05:42,377
Forty francs.

153
01:05:43,121 --> 01:05:45,681
Listen, asshole. I've been
trapped in here longer than that,

154
01:05:45,790 --> 01:05:48,054
and I don't need your fuckin' charity.

155
01:05:49,127 --> 01:05:50,594
It must be 48 or 49.

156
01:05:50,795 --> 01:05:52,387
Here's 50.

157
01:05:52,564 --> 01:05:53,792
Keep the change.

158
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:57,465
You think I was born yesterday?

159
01:06:17,155 --> 01:06:18,588
Watch out for yourself!

160
01:06:19,824 --> 01:06:21,917
Watch out yourself.

161
01:07:16,014 --> 01:07:17,879
Don't you look where you're going?
We're not in Africa here!

162
01:07:17,982 --> 01:07:19,381
You're a racist!

163
01:07:19,584 --> 01:07:22,280
No, I'm not a racist,
but you drive like a fuckin' black!

164
01:07:23,021 --> 01:07:25,319
The road goes this way,
and you were going that way!

165
01:07:26,191 --> 01:07:28,022
Are you blind or what?

166
01:07:29,327 --> 01:07:30,624
But it's not my fault!

167
01:09:54,539 --> 01:09:55,938
I can't see a thing.

168
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:59,969
They could put up a streetlight
once in a while in Rome.

169
01:10:18,696 --> 01:10:22,063
Would you like to meet and make love?

170
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:25,328
Confirmed. I repeat,
send a car immediately.

171
01:10:25,503 --> 01:10:27,164
Where should we do it?

172
01:10:27,271 --> 01:10:28,932
12 Marmoratta Street.

173
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:29,870
And then?

174
01:10:30,007 --> 01:10:31,031
Buffalota Street, number 40.

175
01:10:31,175 --> 01:10:32,142
And after?

176
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:34,437
Piazza Quadrata, but there is no number.

177
01:10:34,679 --> 01:10:37,978
Okay, we'll do it in Piazza Quadrata.

178
01:10:38,116 --> 01:10:40,380
Correct, confirmed,
but there is no number.

179
01:10:42,019 --> 01:10:43,850
How many times will we do it?

180
01:10:44,088 --> 01:10:45,646
One thousand and one.

181
01:10:45,757 --> 01:10:46,985
How soon?

182
01:10:47,358 --> 01:10:49,019
Five minutes. Three cars.

183
01:10:49,127 --> 01:10:52,494
Three taxis? You little slut!
We're through.

184
01:11:13,484 --> 01:11:16,009
Hotel Genius.
What a name for a hotel!

185
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,754
Good evening.
I'd like a room between...

186
01:11:19,657 --> 01:11:21,989
Leonardo da Vinci and Einstein.

187
01:11:22,193 --> 01:11:23,990
Yes, thank you.
Who's this?

188
01:11:24,128 --> 01:11:25,356
Dante Alighieri, how's it going?

189
01:11:25,496 --> 01:11:27,930
I'm here having coffee
with Shakespeare.

190
01:11:28,065 --> 01:11:29,089
Isaac Newton!

191
01:11:29,267 --> 01:11:30,325
Beethoven!

192
01:11:30,701 --> 01:11:33,033
Beethoven, I'd like you to meet
Charlie Parker.

193
01:11:37,074 --> 01:11:38,541
Say something to him, Charlie.

194
01:11:46,784 --> 01:11:49,218
Charlie Parker at the Hotel Genius...

195
01:11:51,222 --> 01:11:53,281
If there's no room
at the Hotel Genius

196
01:11:53,491 --> 01:11:55,516
I'll take a room
at the Hotel lmbecile.

197
01:12:04,869 --> 01:12:07,269
Rome deserted.

198
01:12:08,406 --> 01:12:10,067
Beautiful city.

199
01:12:10,508 --> 01:12:12,499
The Romans have all left Rome.

200
01:12:12,610 --> 01:12:13,907
Where did they go?

201
01:12:14,111 --> 01:12:15,635
Everyone's in Bergamo.

202
01:12:15,847 --> 01:12:17,872
What do they do in Bergamo?

203
01:12:29,827 --> 01:12:32,193
I love these one-way streets!

204
01:12:34,799 --> 01:12:37,393
It's like bumper cars.

205
01:12:38,536 --> 01:12:41,664
"ln the middle
of the journey of our life,

206
01:12:41,806 --> 01:12:44,104
oh, dear friends, to you I convey,

207
01:12:44,208 --> 01:12:46,904
I found myself
down a street one way."

208
01:12:56,854 --> 01:12:59,414
It's a one-way street!

209
01:13:00,458 --> 01:13:03,325
That's right,
it's one-way, you jerk!

210
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:14,432
This wall wasn't here yesterday!

211
01:13:14,639 --> 01:13:16,732
Like Saint Pete, I will retreat.

212
01:13:19,477 --> 01:13:22,810
And like the saints that led,
I'll move ahead.

213
01:13:25,416 --> 01:13:26,849
Another one-way street!

214
01:13:26,984 --> 01:13:30,112
They're always changing everything.
Fuckin' idiots...

215
01:13:36,861 --> 01:13:38,021
I'm dangerous?

216
01:13:38,529 --> 01:13:41,089
I've got a taxi and they've got guns

217
01:13:41,332 --> 01:13:43,129
and I'm dangerous!

218
01:13:46,671 --> 01:13:50,129
I should turn around
and run them both over.

219
01:14:22,807 --> 01:14:25,674
A bishop alone in Rome at 4:00 a.m.!

220
01:14:26,077 --> 01:14:27,237
Bad luck! Touch my balls.

221
01:15:07,585 --> 01:15:10,418
Excuse me, Father.
The statue confused me.

222
01:15:10,521 --> 01:15:12,614
I couldn't see you. Excuse me.

223
01:15:12,757 --> 01:15:16,124
Across town, please. To Tiburtino.

224
01:15:16,227 --> 01:15:18,718
Tiburtino? Not the Vatican?
Aren't you a bishop?

225
01:15:18,996 --> 01:15:22,227
No, not the Vatican.
And I'm not a bishop.

226
01:15:52,963 --> 01:15:59,163
Father, I want to tell you
that I'm deeply honored

227
01:15:59,370 --> 01:16:01,429
to have a bishop in my taxi.

228
01:16:02,173 --> 01:16:04,664
My dear son, I'm not a bishop.

229
01:16:04,975 --> 01:16:07,500
Yes, I know,
you're not a bishop, but...

230
01:16:14,185 --> 01:16:16,949
My son, may I ask you a favor?

231
01:16:17,221 --> 01:16:18,347
Anything, Father!

232
01:16:18,756 --> 01:16:20,883
Could you remove your sunglasses?

233
01:16:21,025 --> 01:16:23,892
It's not safe to drive at night
with dark glasses.

234
01:16:32,369 --> 01:16:35,202
I put them on this morning
and forgot I was wearing them.

235
01:16:36,006 --> 01:16:38,065
I see better now. Thank you!

236
01:16:39,477 --> 01:16:43,641
I feel like a blind man
who's miraculously recovered his sight!

237
01:17:02,566 --> 01:17:04,329
Everything okay, Father?

238
01:17:04,502 --> 01:17:05,867
Everything's okay.

239
01:17:37,401 --> 01:17:41,167
Excuse me,
but it says NO SMOKlNG.

240
01:17:41,505 --> 01:17:44,872
That sign? I keep forgetting
to get rid of it. Sorry, Father.

241
01:17:47,244 --> 01:17:50,509
They put one in every taxi.
It's ridiculous.

242
01:18:21,378 --> 01:18:25,075
Father, I know this will sound
a little strange,

243
01:18:25,282 --> 01:18:27,682
but here we are alone,
at night in a taxi,

244
01:18:28,619 --> 01:18:30,712
and it's a little embarrassing,

245
01:18:30,988 --> 01:18:32,353
but I would like to confess.

246
01:18:33,757 --> 01:18:36,351
But this is not
the appropriate place, my son.

247
01:18:37,127 --> 01:18:38,924
I know, I said it myself

248
01:18:39,063 --> 01:18:42,692
we're in a taxi, not church,
but I must confess, Father.

249
01:18:43,133 --> 01:18:46,227
Dear son, confession is an act
that must remain anonymous.

250
01:18:46,337 --> 01:18:50,273
The church must preserve this
anonymity. Otherwise...

251
01:18:51,175 --> 01:18:53,973
But I promise I won't tell anyone!

252
01:18:55,145 --> 01:18:57,670
I'm not Roman, I'm Tuscan.

253
01:18:57,781 --> 01:19:00,045
I've had this taxi for 1 5 years
here in Rome,

254
01:19:00,150 --> 01:19:01,412
and in 1 5 years

255
01:19:01,518 --> 01:19:04,146
I swear I've never
picked up the same person twice.

256
01:19:04,722 --> 01:19:07,418
And even if I picked you up
again in 1 0 years

257
01:19:07,658 --> 01:19:09,523
I wouldn't recognize you,
dressed as a bishop.

258
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:12,420
And I promise I won't
look you in the face.

259
01:19:12,763 --> 01:19:14,697
After all, I've got to drive.

260
01:19:16,767 --> 01:19:19,167
I must confess. Please!

261
01:19:20,104 --> 01:19:23,562
You won't have to pay the fare, okay?

262
01:19:25,509 --> 01:19:29,070
If you don't hear my confession,
I'm afraid I'll burn in hell.

263
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:31,675
But this is unacceptable.

264
01:19:33,450 --> 01:19:36,385
Father, I've got
so many sins to confess.

265
01:19:38,522 --> 01:19:42,014
First thing, when I was about
1 2 or 1 3 years old,

266
01:19:42,226 --> 01:19:45,093
when boys become big men,

267
01:19:45,362 --> 01:19:47,455
well, each his own physique...

268
01:19:48,632 --> 01:19:53,763
and you begin to feel that
desire for, how can I say it...

269
01:19:54,171 --> 01:19:55,103
for love!

270
01:19:55,472 --> 01:19:56,461
For sex!

271
01:19:57,308 --> 01:19:58,605
You feel the need for

272
01:19:59,209 --> 01:20:00,369
release!

273
01:20:03,147 --> 01:20:07,607
You understand?
To relieve this desire to...

274
01:20:09,787 --> 01:20:13,746
Anyway, I lived in the country
and there weren't many women,

275
01:20:13,891 --> 01:20:15,859
and though you're still a kid,

276
01:20:17,695 --> 01:20:19,959
inside you feel a man's feeling,

277
01:20:20,864 --> 01:20:25,358
and there was no way to...
release this feeling.

278
01:20:27,504 --> 01:20:31,838
So the idea, not mine,
but a real intelligent friend of mine's,

279
01:20:31,942 --> 01:20:34,137
of relieving ourselves with...

280
01:20:34,278 --> 01:20:37,179
we made love with...
how do I say this?

281
01:20:37,915 --> 01:20:39,815
With pumpkins.

282
01:20:40,751 --> 01:20:44,551
Warm, soft, damp,
with seeds inside, so round...

283
01:20:47,558 --> 01:20:51,892
And we would...
Help me find the words, Father.

284
01:20:52,396 --> 01:20:55,058
We relieved ourselves
with these pumpkins.

285
01:20:58,569 --> 01:21:02,027
But then, after a certain age, I quit.

286
01:21:02,740 --> 01:21:05,140
I don't know if my friends quit,
but that's their business.

287
01:21:06,944 --> 01:21:10,505
I quit because I felt, Father,
and I'm sure you'll agree,

288
01:21:10,614 --> 01:21:14,641
in growing up to be a sensitive,
even religious man,

289
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:17,550
that love is something every man needs

290
01:21:17,888 --> 01:21:20,686
not with a vegetable,
but with something

291
01:21:20,991 --> 01:21:21,923
alive!

292
01:21:22,893 --> 01:21:28,092
Something that moves, that's warm,
that looks you in the eyes.

293
01:21:28,632 --> 01:21:30,759
Something with a soul.

294
01:21:31,301 --> 01:21:32,700
Anyway, there was a...

295
01:21:32,803 --> 01:21:34,327
a sheep.

296
01:21:34,438 --> 01:21:36,269
A beautiful little sheep!

297
01:21:38,442 --> 01:21:42,242
She was nice, kind, sweet, pretty.

298
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:44,675
I called her Lola.

299
01:21:44,782 --> 01:21:47,444
Not an ugly old sheep like the others,

300
01:21:47,918 --> 01:21:50,819
but a little sheep. So delicate, refined!

301
01:21:51,488 --> 01:21:54,787
Soft wool, two big eyes watching me.

302
01:21:55,325 --> 01:21:57,623
At first I didn't even notice.

303
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:02,459
And what a sweet little voice!

304
01:22:05,969 --> 01:22:07,800
And I was enchanted.

305
01:22:08,005 --> 01:22:08,937
Not like the other sheep.

306
01:22:12,342 --> 01:22:15,470
Her movements were so refined.

307
01:22:18,649 --> 01:22:20,708
She'd come beside me, and somehow

308
01:22:21,185 --> 01:22:22,880
I was always on top of her.

309
01:22:25,322 --> 01:22:28,086
She was so pretty... even erotic!

310
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:32,151
She would embarrass me because

311
01:22:33,697 --> 01:22:36,495
she would come around
when I was with my friends.

312
01:22:40,337 --> 01:22:43,272
People began to notice this.
It was embarrassing.

313
01:22:44,208 --> 01:22:46,403
In fact, finally my father noticed.

314
01:22:47,211 --> 01:22:48,644
A horrible memory.

315
01:22:48,912 --> 01:22:50,846
Do you know what my father did?

316
01:22:50,981 --> 01:22:52,915
He sold her to a

317
01:22:57,087 --> 01:22:58,349
a butcher.

318
01:22:59,857 --> 01:23:02,655
He sold my Lola to a butcher!

319
01:23:03,026 --> 01:23:05,893
A butcher named Guido Rusticoni.

320
01:23:06,029 --> 01:23:10,693
A fat, hairy, sweaty guy.
Rude, uneducated.

321
01:23:10,868 --> 01:23:14,497
Really ugly, disgusting.
He was horrible.

322
01:23:15,105 --> 01:23:17,801
My Lola to a butcher
for 80,000 lire.

323
01:23:18,041 --> 01:23:21,374
I felt so badly that
I haven't eaten meat since.

324
01:23:21,678 --> 01:23:24,704
Even now when they ask me,
"Do you want some lamb?"

325
01:23:24,948 --> 01:23:27,178
Me, lamb? No, thanks.

326
01:23:27,618 --> 01:23:30,712
I don't eat vegetables either,
because of the pumpkins.

327
01:23:31,288 --> 01:23:33,916
In fact, I don't eat much
at all anymore.

328
01:23:34,858 --> 01:23:37,418
It was very traumatic for me.

329
01:23:37,761 --> 01:23:42,664
What I want to say is,
I understand that these are big sins,

330
01:23:43,901 --> 01:23:46,665
but truly, Father, they are sins of love.

331
01:24:21,004 --> 01:24:23,234
Gino, how are you?

332
01:24:25,475 --> 01:24:28,808
Nothing's going on, really.
No customers.

333
01:24:28,946 --> 01:24:30,277
It's a lousy night.

334
01:24:30,747 --> 01:24:32,840
Nothing here either. A real slow night.

335
01:24:32,983 --> 01:24:35,281
We haven't made a cent.

336
01:24:36,687 --> 01:24:37,619
A bishop.

337
01:24:37,921 --> 01:24:39,218
A bishop?!

338
01:24:39,323 --> 01:24:41,416
A real one? Oh, let me see!

339
01:24:41,858 --> 01:24:44,622
What a darling little bishop!

340
01:24:51,134 --> 01:24:52,192
He's charming.

341
01:24:55,105 --> 01:24:57,471
Stop by later, okay?

342
01:25:08,018 --> 01:25:10,316
Gino always cheers me up.

343
01:25:13,957 --> 01:25:15,754
Pretty girls, eh?

344
01:25:16,026 --> 01:25:18,995
So, my brother Vincenzo
lives here in Rome too.

345
01:25:19,429 --> 01:25:22,796
He's a plumber. Repairs pipes, water.

346
01:25:22,966 --> 01:25:24,991
One night he invited me to dinner,

347
01:25:26,169 --> 01:25:28,433
he and my sister-in-law.
Monica.

348
01:25:28,805 --> 01:25:30,932
So I went to their house.

349
01:25:31,041 --> 01:25:33,942
They have a female dog too.
Very cute.

350
01:25:34,344 --> 01:25:37,939
So after dinner,
he got an emergency call.

351
01:25:40,751 --> 01:25:44,847
The pipes exploded in a condominium.
Water everywhere.

352
01:25:46,757 --> 01:25:49,351
And like a lightning bolt,
he ran off with his tools,

353
01:25:50,661 --> 01:25:53,027
and I was left alone with Monica.

354
01:25:53,263 --> 01:25:56,528
Now, Monica is beautiful!
You should see her.

355
01:25:56,667 --> 01:25:58,794
Absolutely gorgeous.

356
01:26:01,071 --> 01:26:03,539
She really likes me.

357
01:26:04,207 --> 01:26:08,837
She always looks at me
with those strange "sister-in-law eyes."

358
01:26:09,046 --> 01:26:11,344
At their wedding I said,
"Congratulations!"

359
01:26:12,215 --> 01:26:14,206
But she looked at me strangely.

360
01:26:14,351 --> 01:26:17,081
She married my brother,
and we're the same type.

361
01:26:17,187 --> 01:26:19,587
I'm even more handsome than he is.

362
01:26:20,190 --> 01:26:22,181
So Monica and I were alone.

363
01:26:22,526 --> 01:26:25,154
She started to clean up at the sink.

364
01:26:25,462 --> 01:26:29,091
As she bent over,
I was sitting behind her like this,

365
01:26:29,933 --> 01:26:32,697
and from this position I saw

366
01:26:32,903 --> 01:26:34,029
two cheeks!

367
01:26:36,940 --> 01:26:39,670
An ass from out of this world!

368
01:26:39,776 --> 01:26:41,471
With tiny white panties,

369
01:26:41,578 --> 01:26:44,604
riding up a little
so you could see one whole cheek!

370
01:26:44,748 --> 01:26:46,045
The other was partly covered.

371
01:26:46,149 --> 01:26:50,108
Father, I couldn't control myself!

372
01:26:50,587 --> 01:26:54,114
She turned and looked back at me
with those eyes...

373
01:26:56,259 --> 01:26:58,591
and suddenly I was on top of her.

374
01:26:58,795 --> 01:27:00,729
Father, that beautiful ass!

375
01:27:02,099 --> 01:27:05,762
Pink, soft, round like a pumpkin!

376
01:27:06,069 --> 01:27:09,095
Those soft, wool panties
reminded me of the sheep,

377
01:27:09,272 --> 01:27:11,604
the pumpkin, the sheep,
my brother's wife...

378
01:27:12,142 --> 01:27:13,734
I was on fire!

379
01:27:15,479 --> 01:27:18,778
Then we were on the floor,
under the table!

380
01:27:19,649 --> 01:27:21,014
The beauty of it!

381
01:27:21,118 --> 01:27:25,384
What pleasure! We enjoyed ourselves like...
imagine, Father...

382
01:27:25,522 --> 01:27:27,490
Heaven on earth!

383
01:27:28,658 --> 01:27:32,389
I said to myself,
"But this is my brother's wife!"

384
01:27:32,496 --> 01:27:34,054
But I couldn't stop!

385
01:27:34,164 --> 01:27:37,725
And I said it again,
"It's your brother's wife! Stop!"

386
01:27:37,834 --> 01:27:39,131
But I couldn't!

387
01:27:41,972 --> 01:27:43,234
It lasted hours!

388
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:44,500
And she screamed!

389
01:27:45,475 --> 01:27:46,601
And I screamed!

390
01:27:48,178 --> 01:27:49,975
It was terrible.

391
01:27:50,147 --> 01:27:51,512
Just beautiful.

392
01:27:51,782 --> 01:27:52,840
I turned her over,

393
01:27:54,284 --> 01:27:57,981
kissed her all over,
her neck, her perfect breasts...

394
01:27:58,722 --> 01:28:00,952
I stayed there all night.

395
01:28:01,825 --> 01:28:04,623
I never went back
because she's my brother's wife,

396
01:28:05,061 --> 01:28:06,995
although he never noticed anything.

397
01:28:07,197 --> 01:28:09,290
Now she smiles
whenever she sees me

398
01:28:10,801 --> 01:28:14,862
and I say, "Remember when
we fucked like animals on the floor?"

399
01:28:15,005 --> 01:28:17,599
It was truly paradise!

400
01:28:17,707 --> 01:28:19,868
My gorgeous sister-in-law!

401
01:28:20,877 --> 01:28:24,404
I don't know if you ever made love
with your sister-in-law, Father,

402
01:28:24,548 --> 01:28:28,575
but you should try it,
because it's absolute heaven.

403
01:28:28,718 --> 01:28:31,312
Then you just confess. It's incredible.

404
01:28:31,721 --> 01:28:36,181
Father, I know these sins
must be confessed,

405
01:28:36,593 --> 01:28:38,686
but they were just so wonderful.

406
01:28:54,611 --> 01:28:56,545
I haven't upset you, have l?

407
01:28:56,746 --> 01:28:57,906
I guess he fell asleep.

408
01:29:10,060 --> 01:29:11,823
Father, don't fool around!

409
01:29:21,571 --> 01:29:23,596
Not feeling well?

410
01:29:26,610 --> 01:29:29,579
You're not... dead, are you?
I don't hear anything!

411
01:29:29,779 --> 01:29:30,837
Holy shit!

412
01:29:35,585 --> 01:29:37,416
It's me, your taxi driver!

413
01:29:37,921 --> 01:29:39,411
I've killed him!

414
01:29:45,128 --> 01:29:47,426
My God, what have I done?

415
01:29:48,131 --> 01:29:48,995
He's dead!

416
01:29:55,005 --> 01:29:56,563
I've killed a priest.

417
01:29:56,706 --> 01:29:58,765
Even worse, a bishop!

418
01:30:01,311 --> 01:30:02,778
They'll give me life!

419
01:30:03,113 --> 01:30:05,809
How many years do you get
for a bishop? Twenty? Thirty?

420
01:30:08,952 --> 01:30:10,214
Are you asleep?

421
01:30:10,987 --> 01:30:12,147
Joking?

422
01:30:13,957 --> 01:30:15,891
He's dead. I've killed a priest!

423
01:30:16,226 --> 01:30:17,716
I'll be in all the papers:

424
01:30:17,827 --> 01:30:19,727
TAXl DRlVER KlLLS BlSHOP

425
01:30:20,096 --> 01:30:23,554
My brother will find out everything
about me and Monica!

426
01:30:23,667 --> 01:30:25,134
What a fucking mess!

427
01:30:31,007 --> 01:30:33,441
And such a nice little priest.
So delicate!

428
01:30:33,677 --> 01:30:36,771
I shouldn't have told him
about the sheep and Monica!

429
01:30:37,981 --> 01:30:41,109
I'm sorry, Father.
Now I'll really burn in hell!

430
01:30:43,820 --> 01:30:45,310
Where should I put him?

431
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:53,684
Only a priest,
but he weighs enough to be a cardinal.

432
01:36:54,791 --> 01:36:58,227
40 India Street, first call.

433
01:36:59,162 --> 01:37:02,222
40 India Street, car needed.
Second call.

434
01:37:03,599 --> 01:37:09,094
Car 285 to India Street.
Thanks, 285.

435
01:37:12,675 --> 01:37:17,305
29 Industrial Road,
three customers waiting. First call.

436
01:37:18,214 --> 01:37:21,945
29 Industrial Road,
three customers. Second call.

437
01:37:22,819 --> 01:37:26,687
Industrial Road 29,
three customers. Third call.

438
01:37:29,692 --> 01:37:32,160
Car 1 01 will take I ndustrial Road.

439
01:37:34,864 --> 01:37:37,128
Hi, Mika! Okay. Bye, bye.

440
01:37:38,668 --> 01:37:39,635
Bye, bye.

441
01:38:51,274 --> 01:38:52,741
You called a taxi?

442
01:38:53,810 --> 01:38:55,903
No, we called a garbage truck.

443
01:38:57,547 --> 01:38:59,981
But you'll have to do the job.

444
01:39:15,465 --> 01:39:16,796
Is he all right?

445
01:39:18,801 --> 01:39:20,769
No, he's not all right.

446
01:39:22,405 --> 01:39:24,066
But don't worry about it.

447
01:39:27,810 --> 01:39:28,902
Let's go.

448
01:39:29,812 --> 01:39:30,710
Where?

449
01:39:32,515 --> 01:39:33,607
Home.

450
01:39:34,484 --> 01:39:37,180
My house is closest,
so drop me off first.

451
01:39:37,854 --> 01:39:39,947
We're gonna take Aki home first.

452
01:39:41,157 --> 01:39:43,421
But he lives furthest away,
and he's fucked-up.

453
01:39:43,860 --> 01:39:46,351
You're the one who's fucked-up.
He's our friend,

454
01:39:46,562 --> 01:39:49,588
and in that condition, we've got to
make sure he gets home okay.

455
01:39:49,832 --> 01:39:51,129
Then you'll have to pay.

456
01:39:51,334 --> 01:39:52,392
But I don't have any money!

457
01:39:52,602 --> 01:39:53,762
Well, I don't either!

458
01:39:59,842 --> 01:40:01,275
What about him?

459
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:06,110
His severance pay.

460
01:40:06,849 --> 01:40:08,976
Okay, we've got money.

461
01:40:09,519 --> 01:40:10,417
Let's go.

462
01:40:10,987 --> 01:40:12,113
Where?

463
01:40:13,022 --> 01:40:15,354
We all live on the same block.

464
01:40:16,058 --> 01:40:17,992
Just drive across town.

465
01:40:55,731 --> 01:40:57,323
What's your name?

466
01:40:57,967 --> 01:40:58,831
Mika.

467
01:41:00,536 --> 01:41:03,767
When I was a kid
I had a hamster named Mika.

468
01:41:09,946 --> 01:41:13,211
By the way, what was that
about his severance pay?

469
01:41:15,084 --> 01:41:17,177
He lost his job today.

470
01:41:19,522 --> 01:41:20,580
Is he all right?

471
01:41:22,258 --> 01:41:24,419
No, he's not all right.

472
01:41:24,827 --> 01:41:28,263
Didn't he just tell you
that he lost his job today?

473
01:41:30,633 --> 01:41:32,863
He's all fucked-up,

474
01:41:33,169 --> 01:41:37,265
and losing his job
is just a small part of it.

475
01:41:38,641 --> 01:41:39,801
What do you mean?

476
01:41:41,477 --> 01:41:45,106
Today was the worst fuckin' day
of his entire life,

477
01:41:46,282 --> 01:41:48,079
that's what I fuckin' mean.

478
01:41:51,020 --> 01:41:54,080
Or yesterday was, anyway...

479
01:41:58,494 --> 01:41:59,756
I'm sorry to hear that.

480
01:42:02,632 --> 01:42:04,361
What would you know about it?

481
01:42:05,701 --> 01:42:08,192
You have no idea how he feels.

482
01:42:12,575 --> 01:42:15,703
At the moment, I doubt he feels
much of anything.

483
01:42:17,980 --> 01:42:22,349
Look, Mr. Taxi Man, don't fuck with us!

484
01:42:22,652 --> 01:42:25,177
Be careful, you idiot! He's driving!

485
01:42:25,388 --> 01:42:26,355
You're the idiot!

486
01:42:26,589 --> 01:42:29,649
Stop! Or you morons can walk home!

487
01:42:50,613 --> 01:42:52,012
Can I ask something?

488
01:42:53,582 --> 01:42:54,378
What?

489
01:42:56,552 --> 01:43:00,420
Your friend. What happened to him
that was so terrible?

490
01:43:01,223 --> 01:43:02,520
Besides losing his job, I mean.

491
01:43:05,394 --> 01:43:07,328
What was so terrible?

492
01:43:08,698 --> 01:43:11,189
I'll tell you what was so terrible.

493
01:43:12,468 --> 01:43:16,165
This morning
he drives his car to work.

494
01:43:16,405 --> 01:43:18,566
New car, just paid off.

495
01:43:19,842 --> 01:43:22,106
He parks and goes to work.

496
01:43:24,547 --> 01:43:27,107
He's late for work,
but that's nothing new.

497
01:43:27,650 --> 01:43:30,244
But today, bad news:

498
01:43:30,553 --> 01:43:32,111
he's fired.

499
01:43:32,321 --> 01:43:34,414
Late once too often.

500
01:43:35,791 --> 01:43:38,282
So then he has a big fight
with his boss.

501
01:43:38,427 --> 01:43:41,590
They throw him out into the street

502
01:43:41,831 --> 01:43:43,924
and his severance pay after him.

503
01:43:46,635 --> 01:43:49,934
He picks up the envelope,
brushes himself off

504
01:43:50,039 --> 01:43:52,633
and walks back to his car.

505
01:43:53,142 --> 01:43:56,669
But instead of his brand-new car

506
01:43:58,514 --> 01:44:03,383
there's a smashed,
fucked-up ghost of his car.

507
01:44:03,753 --> 01:44:05,220
Smashed to fuckin' shit.

508
01:44:06,455 --> 01:44:10,255
Some fuckin' idiot
has turned his brand-new car

509
01:44:10,793 --> 01:44:12,522
into a useless pile of shit.

510
01:44:13,929 --> 01:44:18,457
So he has a few drinks to calm down,
then takes a bus home.

511
01:44:18,667 --> 01:44:22,569
At home, waiting for him,
are his wife and 1 6-year-old daughter.

512
01:44:23,038 --> 01:44:27,737
They're both crying, and the wife
tells him they have a big problem.

513
01:44:29,178 --> 01:44:33,308
Then the daughter runs off
to her room, crying.

514
01:44:33,516 --> 01:44:37,077
And the wife tells him that
his daughter, 1 6 and unmarried,

515
01:44:37,286 --> 01:44:38,651
is pregnant.

516
01:44:38,854 --> 01:44:41,448
A beautiful girl too, his daughter.

517
01:44:41,724 --> 01:44:46,593
You shut up! That's no way to talk
about our best friend's little daughter.

518
01:44:46,762 --> 01:44:48,093
I didn't mean it like that!

519
01:44:48,197 --> 01:44:52,224
I know what you meant,
you fuckin' slimy fungus!

520
01:44:53,669 --> 01:44:55,261
So, is that all?

521
01:44:57,006 --> 01:44:58,769
No, that's not all.

522
01:45:00,042 --> 01:45:03,273
He tells his wife that he's lost his job

523
01:45:03,479 --> 01:45:05,572
and then about their car.

524
01:45:06,415 --> 01:45:11,114
She becomes hysterical
and screams that she wants a divorce.

525
01:45:12,455 --> 01:45:16,186
That he's no good as a father
or a husband.

526
01:45:17,460 --> 01:45:20,020
And then she chases him from the house

527
01:45:20,729 --> 01:45:22,629
with a big fuckin' butcher's knife.

528
01:45:22,832 --> 01:45:23,799
A bread knife.

529
01:45:24,033 --> 01:45:25,193
A butcher's knife!

530
01:45:25,468 --> 01:45:27,231
He said it was a bread knife!

531
01:45:27,470 --> 01:45:29,961
No, he made a point of saying
it was a butcher's knife!

532
01:46:17,786 --> 01:46:19,651
Things could have been worse.

533
01:46:24,126 --> 01:46:26,026
What could possibly be worse than that?

534
01:46:28,197 --> 01:46:31,189
Okay, Mr. Taxi Man.

535
01:46:32,468 --> 01:46:36,268
Whatever happened to you
that was worse than that?

536
01:46:38,173 --> 01:46:39,367
You want me to tell you?

537
01:46:40,643 --> 01:46:41,439
Yeah.

538
01:46:42,478 --> 01:46:45,106
Do you have any children?

539
01:46:45,848 --> 01:46:46,906
I have a son.

540
01:46:47,182 --> 01:46:48,274
I have a daughter.

541
01:46:49,852 --> 01:46:53,151
I'm glad I have a son
and not a daughter.

542
01:46:53,322 --> 01:46:55,688
You're an idiot.
A daughter is much better.

543
01:46:56,191 --> 01:46:59,126
That way you won't have a son
who'll grow up to be like you.

544
01:47:00,296 --> 01:47:02,526
Even more important then,
in your case.

545
01:47:02,765 --> 01:47:05,199
In your case,
soon nothing will be important!

546
01:47:05,401 --> 01:47:08,427
Knock it off!
Or you idiots will have a long walk.

547
01:47:15,945 --> 01:47:19,142
What about the terrible story
you were about to tell us?

548
01:47:21,717 --> 01:47:22,979
I'm married.

549
01:47:23,719 --> 01:47:25,380
That is terrible!

550
01:47:25,588 --> 01:47:26,577
Big deal.

551
01:47:26,722 --> 01:47:32,422
My wife and I both work hard.
She has a job, and I have two jobs.

552
01:47:33,596 --> 01:47:36,224
We've been saving money
because we want to have a family.

553
01:47:36,565 --> 01:47:38,726
A daughter or a son.

554
01:47:40,202 --> 01:47:42,898
For a year we've worked at
having a baby.

555
01:47:43,706 --> 01:47:45,936
Nice work if you can get it.

556
01:47:46,241 --> 01:47:48,766
Shut up and let him finish.

557
01:47:49,678 --> 01:47:52,078
Is that your wife?

558
01:47:52,548 --> 01:47:53,037
Yeah.

559
01:47:54,450 --> 01:47:55,610
Eija.

560
01:47:57,953 --> 01:48:01,616
Anyway, after a while
my wife became pregnant.

561
01:48:02,424 --> 01:48:06,019
We were so happy.
My wife's belly got bigger and bigger.

562
01:48:06,829 --> 01:48:09,855
Then, in the sixth month,
she started feeling strange

563
01:48:10,366 --> 01:48:12,630
so I took her to the hospital
right away.

564
01:48:14,770 --> 01:48:16,067
Was she all right?

565
01:48:16,939 --> 01:48:19,908
Well, I took her to the hospital
and they took her inside.

566
01:48:21,076 --> 01:48:23,909
I was worried,
waiting and waiting for hours.

567
01:48:25,414 --> 01:48:27,314
Finally the doctor came and told me

568
01:48:27,516 --> 01:48:29,541
that Eija had a baby.

569
01:48:30,419 --> 01:48:35,254
She was all right, and the baby,
a little girl, was alive.

570
01:48:36,325 --> 01:48:38,589
I was so happy
I was about to explode.

571
01:48:39,461 --> 01:48:40,894
A little daughter.

572
01:48:43,932 --> 01:48:45,763
But the doctor looked worried.

573
01:48:46,702 --> 01:48:49,000
He told me the baby
was way too early.

574
01:48:50,205 --> 01:48:53,902
So far she was okay,
but she was in an incubator.

575
01:48:55,310 --> 01:48:56,572
And then he said

576
01:48:58,147 --> 01:49:00,843
there was almost no chance
the baby would live.

577
01:49:08,657 --> 01:49:09,954
So what happened?

578
01:49:12,961 --> 01:49:16,624
The next day I brought my wife home
from the hospital,

579
01:49:17,566 --> 01:49:20,160
but the baby stayed there
in the incubator.

580
01:49:22,004 --> 01:49:23,494
You should have seen her though.

581
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:26,803
So tiny and perfect.

582
01:49:27,543 --> 01:49:29,636
Tiny hands, tiny feet.

583
01:49:31,513 --> 01:49:34,676
She was shaped like a little peanut.

584
01:49:41,523 --> 01:49:43,957
But the doctor didn't give us much hope.

585
01:49:44,927 --> 01:49:48,158
He said she wouldn't live
more than a week,

586
01:49:48,430 --> 01:49:50,022
our tiny daughter.

587
01:49:51,366 --> 01:49:54,199
Eija was so scared
that she was about to go crazy.

588
01:49:54,870 --> 01:49:56,337
So I made a big decision.

589
01:49:57,372 --> 01:50:00,671
I decided that I wouldn't love
this tiny little child.

590
01:50:01,844 --> 01:50:05,871
If she was going to die, I would
have to stay strong and distant.

591
01:50:06,348 --> 01:50:10,182
I couldn't stand the pain
of losing this child.

592
01:50:12,054 --> 01:50:15,080
So I decided to kill my love.

593
01:50:23,766 --> 01:50:26,826
A week went by, and the baby lived.

594
01:50:30,873 --> 01:50:34,604
Then another week went by,
and part of a third.

595
01:50:36,078 --> 01:50:39,343
After three entire weeks
the child was still alive.

596
01:50:40,048 --> 01:50:42,448
But the doctor was still very negative.

597
01:50:43,118 --> 01:50:44,983
That started to make me angry.

598
01:50:45,854 --> 01:50:48,220
I sat up all night in the kitchen

599
01:50:48,757 --> 01:50:50,884
while my poor wife lay awake
in the bedroom.

600
01:50:53,428 --> 01:50:56,226
And I sat there, just as the dawn
was about to break.

601
01:50:57,499 --> 01:51:00,229
The light outside
was just like it is right now.

602
01:51:01,703 --> 01:51:05,264
Then Eija came to me
and said I'd made a mistake.

603
01:51:06,708 --> 01:51:08,198
I realized she was right.

604
01:51:08,944 --> 01:51:12,471
If that baby was going to make it,
it needed all my love.

605
01:51:13,248 --> 01:51:15,011
The strongest love possible.

606
01:51:16,652 --> 01:51:18,176
It was a relief.

607
01:51:18,620 --> 01:51:25,856
I felt my love for that baby surge
through every pore of my worthless body.

608
01:51:29,064 --> 01:51:31,658
I felt so happy and clear.

609
01:51:32,868 --> 01:51:35,428
That little peanut was our child

610
01:51:36,939 --> 01:51:39,203
and we cried out of happiness.

611
01:51:40,209 --> 01:51:43,076
We tried to eat some breakfast,
but we couldn't.

612
01:51:46,882 --> 01:51:48,679
Then we drove to the hospital.

613
01:51:49,818 --> 01:51:53,584
We wanted that baby to feel
all the strength of our love.

614
01:51:57,593 --> 01:51:58,890
At the hospital

615
01:51:58,994 --> 01:52:01,224
the doctor was right there to meet us.

616
01:52:02,264 --> 01:52:04,198
His face was very serious.

617
01:52:05,067 --> 01:52:06,830
He took us aside.

618
01:52:09,338 --> 01:52:12,171
And then he told us
that a short time earlier,

619
01:52:12,274 --> 01:52:14,037
just before sunrise,

620
01:52:14,209 --> 01:52:15,767
the baby had died.

621
01:52:16,144 --> 01:52:20,444
Nothing could be done.
It was too late...

622
01:52:43,705 --> 01:52:44,729
Don't worry.

623
01:52:45,774 --> 01:52:49,107
You and your wife can make another baby.

624
01:52:52,147 --> 01:52:54,308
Maybe we can, sometime.

625
01:52:57,986 --> 01:53:00,045
Such a sad story.

626
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:06,928
You're a good guy, Mika.

627
01:53:09,598 --> 01:53:11,259
Aki is so full of shit.

628
01:53:14,136 --> 01:53:16,832
His life isn't so terrible after all.

629
01:53:17,139 --> 01:53:20,074
He fuckin' whines
about such trivial shit.

630
01:53:20,175 --> 01:53:23,941
Some people have got real troubles.

631
01:53:27,716 --> 01:53:29,445
You're right, Mika.

632
01:53:33,021 --> 01:53:34,955
You're a good man.

633
01:53:41,296 --> 01:53:42,786
We're almost home.

634
01:53:44,032 --> 01:53:48,093
Take the next right, then a left.
That's our street.

635
01:53:49,304 --> 01:53:52,398
What about your friend?
Is he okay now?

636
01:53:52,874 --> 01:53:53,670
Fuck him.

637
01:53:53,809 --> 01:53:55,071
Yeah, forget about him.

638
01:53:55,210 --> 01:53:57,542
What about his wife,
and the big knife?

639
01:53:58,847 --> 01:54:00,474
What knife?

640
01:54:01,483 --> 01:54:03,610
Oh, that. Fuck it.

641
01:54:03,719 --> 01:54:09,021
He'll push his way into one of our houses
if he can't get into his own.

642
01:54:10,158 --> 01:54:11,853
He's a leech anyway.

643
01:55:18,860 --> 01:55:22,853
Don't worry.
Everything will be all right.

644
01:55:23,732 --> 01:55:27,828
Yeah. And send greetings
to your wife, Eija.

645
01:55:28,670 --> 01:55:30,729
Yeah, give her my best too.

646
01:56:44,813 --> 01:56:46,212
Wake up, Aki!

647
01:56:50,585 --> 01:56:52,177
Who the fuck are you?

648
01:56:54,156 --> 01:56:55,623
Where the fuck am l?

649
01:56:55,857 --> 01:56:59,190
You're in a fucking taxi,
near your fucking home

650
01:56:59,327 --> 01:57:01,420
and you owe me the fucking fare.

651
01:57:03,398 --> 01:57:08,335
Yeah, I know. Nothin' for free.

652
01:57:22,250 --> 01:57:23,148
Thanks.

653
01:57:38,533 --> 01:57:39,830
You all right?

654
01:57:43,805 --> 01:57:45,466
You know where you are?

655
01:57:47,008 --> 01:57:47,975
Yeah.

656
01:57:49,678 --> 01:57:50,906
Helsinki.

657
01:58:56,978 --> 01:58:58,206
Morning, Aki.

658
01:58:59,147 --> 01:59:00,273
Morning.
