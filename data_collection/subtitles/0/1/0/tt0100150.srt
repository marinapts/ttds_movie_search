You know I'm a sportin' man.

7
00:00:38,615 --> 00:00:41,049

But I ain't {i1}that{} sportin'.

When I fix a fight--
Say I pay a three to one favorite...

10

to throw a goddamned fight.

11

I figure I got the right
to expect that fight
to go off at three to one.

12
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:56,760
But every time I lay in bed
with this son of a bitch
Bernie Bernbaum,

13
00:00:56,833 --> 00:01:00,132
before I know it,
the odds is even up.

14
00:01:00,203 --> 00:01:02,763
Or worse, I'm bettin'
on the short money.

The odds go straight to hell.

he can make off the vig.{}

He ain't satisfied with
the business I do on his book.

23
00:01:26,429 --> 00:01:29,330
He is sellin' tips on how I bet.

24
00:01:29,399 --> 00:01:32,562
And that means part
of the payoff that should
be riding on my hip...

25
00:01:32,635 --> 00:01:34,796
is riding on someone else's.

26
00:01:34,871 --> 00:01:37,396
So, back we go
to these questions--

27
00:01:37,473 --> 00:01:41,341

28
00:01:41,411 --> 00:01:43,743

29
00:01:46,883 --> 00:01:48,942
So, it's clear what I'm saying?

30
00:01:50,386 --> 00:01:53,253
As mud.

31
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:59,825
It's gettin' so a businessman
can't expect no return
from a fixed fight.

32
00:02:01,631 --> 00:02:05,089
Now, if you can't trust a fix,
what can you trust?

33
00:02:05,168 --> 00:02:08,569
{i1}For a good return, you gotta
go bettin' on chance,{}

34

{i1}and then you're

{i1}Right back in the jungle.{}

36
00:02:12,942 --> 00:02:16,942
{i1}That's why ethics is important--

Where as, uh, Bernie Bernbaum
is a horse of a different color,

40
00:02:26,923 --> 00:02:30,654
ethics-wise, as in
he ain't got any.

41

- You sure it's Bernie
selling you out?
- It ain't elves.

42
00:02:34,897 --> 00:02:38,765
- No one else knows about the fix?
- No one that ain't got ethics.

43
00:02:38,835 --> 00:02:41,861
{i1}What about the fighters
you pay to tank out?{}

44
00:02:41,938 --> 00:02:45,874
We only pick fighters
we know we can put
the fear of God in.

45
00:02:45,942 --> 00:02:48,240
Any other bookies know?
You play anyone else's book?

46
00:02:48,311 --> 00:02:51,542
I-I lay an occasional bet
with Mink Larouie.

47
00:02:51,614 --> 00:02:54,139

I'll vouch for that.
{i1}-How do you know?{}

48
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:57,482
It ain't Mink.
Mink is Eddie Dane's boy.

49
00:02:57,553 --> 00:03:01,387
Of course the Dane
always knows about the fix.

50
00:03:01,457 --> 00:03:03,584
And what the hell
is that supposed to mean?

51
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:07,186
Let it drift. All it means is
a lot of people know.

been listenin'.

54

150
00:12:42,374 --> 00:12:44,899
That's sort of why I'm, uh--

151
00:12:47,512 --> 00:12:50,538
Tommy, I don't know where Verna is.

152
00:12:50,615 --> 00:12:53,914
- Uh-huh.
- I know what youre thinkin',
what else is new?

153
00:12:53,985 --> 00:12:56,977
But the situation now--
I'm worried.

154
00:12:57,055 --> 00:13:00,491
Verna can take care of herself,
maybe better than you can.

155
00:13:00,558 --> 00:13:04,153
- What does that mean?
- Want another one?

00:13:04,229 --> 00:13:06,163
No.

157
00:13:06,231 --> 00:13:08,290
What does that mean?

158
00:13:08,366 --> 00:13:10,766
How far she got
her hooks into you?

159
00:13:10,835 --> 00:13:12,928
That's a hell of a question.

160
00:13:15,073 --> 00:13:17,337
It's a grift.

161
00:13:17,409 --> 00:13:21,072
If she didn't need you
to protect her brother
from Johnny Caspar,

162
00:13:21,146 --> 00:13:24,809
you think she'd still be going
on slow carriage rides with you
through the park?

till Caspar cools down?{}

164
00:13:29,354 --> 00:13:33,222
Jesus, you're a prickly pear.
What's wrong with her wanting
her brother taken care of?

00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,225
{i1}Nothing. I don't blame her.{}

which is you, she plays it.

just like her brother.{}

00:13:40,732 --> 00:13:42,996
Probably had grifter parents
and grifter grandparents...

169
00:13:43,068 --> 00:13:46,162
and someday they're each
gonna spawn little grifter kids.

170

about this. You don't know
what's in Verna's heart.

I put a tail on her this afternoon.

180
00:14:19,514 --> 00:14:23,514
- Uh-huh.
- I asked Rug Daniels
to follow her around,

181
00:14:24,218 --> 00:14:27,415
just, you know,
to keep her out of trouble.

182
00:14:27,488 --> 00:14:31,488
I was worried.
After that meeting with Caspar,
you can't be too careful.

183
00:14:31,693 --> 00:14:34,992
- So what did Rug say that has you
scurrying over here?
- That's just it.

184
00:14:35,063 --> 00:14:39,063
- Nothing. He's disappeared.
- So you lost your lady friend
and the tail you put on her?

185
00:14:40,802 --> 00:14:43,396
I guess it does sound
pretty sorry at that.

You shouldn't be confronting

I've been trying to tell you.

You can't trade
body blows with him.
He's gotten too strong.

I reckon I can still trade body blows
with any man in this town.

Did you see

What did you tell Leo?

I told him you were a tramp
and he should dump you.

00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:05,015
Jesus, Tom. It sounds like
a bad break for me
I wasn't killed!

586
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:08,143
I mean it, Leo.
Start taking Caspar seriously.

587
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:12,219
I know, I know.
Retreat to win, give up Bernie.
That'll solve all our problems.

Wont anymore, I'll grant you that.

But going toe-to-toe
with a psychopath
will get you no where.

590
00:43:17,195 --> 00:43:19,891
It'll force people
to choose sides just when
you're looking shaky.

- The hell I do!
- Then where's the mayor?

Why aren't there
any police here?

593
00:43:25,637 --> 00:43:27,662
Why weren't there any police
At your place last night?

- Dont you think
I can take care of myself?
- I know you can't.

598
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:42,818
Here's the smart play, Leo.
You lay back, you give Bernie up,

599
00:43:42,887 --> 00:43:44,878
you let Caspar think
he's made his point.

600
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:47,948
- Then you wait for him
to show a weakness.
- Please, Tom.

601
00:43:48,026 --> 00:43:50,256
You're sticking on Bernie.
You're sticking your neck out...

602
00:43:50,328 --> 00:43:53,263
for a guy who'd chop you off
at the heels if there
was two bits in it.

Not that I haven't
been a gentleman, but--

608
00:44:17,522 --> 00:44:20,980
I plan to ask her
to marry me, Tom.

609
00:44:25,697 --> 00:44:29,064
I guess you think
that's a bonehead play.

610
00:44:33,371 --> 00:44:37,171
- You think she wants you to?
- How the hell do I know?

611
00:44:37,242 --> 00:44:39,938
I think she does.
Yeah, of course she does.

612

I know you think different,
but, well, we just, uh--

00:44:43,948 --> 00:44:46,314
We just differ on that.

614
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:52,283
Leo, Caspar didn't kill Rug.

615
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:56,123
- Course he did.
- No. Think about it
just this one time.

616
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:58,219
- Who was Rug following?
- Huh?

617
00:44:58,296 --> 00:45:01,857
It needn't have been that
sinister. Strange man follows
her down a dark alleyway.

618
00:45:01,933 --> 00:45:04,333
- I told you she can
look after herself.
- Verna wouldnt panic,

619
00:45:04,402 --> 00:45:07,599
shoot someone just because
he was following her.

620
00:45:07,672 --> 00:45:11,472
Nah, it wouldn't have happened
like that, and if it had
she would have told me.

621
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:14,773
They pulled a .22 slug out of him.
A pop gun, Leo, a woman's gun.

622
00:45:14,846 --> 00:45:17,041
I know you don't
like her, Tom,

623
00:45:17,115 --> 00:45:20,107
but I trust Verna
as much as I trust you.

Okay, Leo.

625
00:45:23,688 --> 00:45:25,986
Maybe it wasn't that innocent.

626
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:29,720
Maybe Rug knew something
she didn't like him knowing
and wouldn't want you to know.

627
00:45:29,794 --> 00:45:33,457
Rug was following her.
Maybe he knew
where she was sleeping,

Mink was robbing me
right along with the shmatte.

884
01:04:16,977 --> 01:04:18,911
What convinced you of that?

885
01:04:18,979 --> 01:04:21,277
Mink took a powder.
We can't find him.

886
01:04:21,348 --> 01:04:23,782
The Dane, hes making
excuses for him.

887
01:04:23,851 --> 01:04:26,285
But personally,
I think you was right.

888
01:04:26,353 --> 01:04:28,981
I think that Mink and Bernie
was in it together.

889
01:04:29,056 --> 01:04:32,492
I think Mink heard
that you bumped
the shmatte and lit out.

890
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:34,858
Lousy son of a bitch.

891
01:04:36,564 --> 01:04:40,091
- I told you so.
- What?

892
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:42,101
[ Laughs ]

893
01:04:42,169 --> 01:04:46,037
You got a lip on you.
That's all right.

894
01:04:46,106 --> 01:04:49,200
I don't generally care for it,
but that's all right.

895
01:04:50,544 --> 01:04:53,479
You was a good sport
to bump the shmatte.

896
01:04:54,548 --> 01:04:56,641
How do you know
Mink skipped?

897
01:04:56,717 --> 01:04:59,550
- Because the Dane can't find him.
- So he says.

898
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:03,620
- Meaning what exactly?
-Maybe nothing.

899
01:05:03,791 --> 01:05:07,791
I didn't give it much thought,
'cause a guy'll say anything
when his number is up.

900
01:05:07,928 --> 01:05:10,658
But, uh,just before
I bumped Bernie,

901
01:05:10,731 --> 01:05:13,825
he swore tome
that Eddie Dane and Mink
were setting him up--

902
01:05:13,901 --> 01:05:16,836
that they were the ones
who sold out your fix.

903
01:05:25,412 --> 01:05:27,346
Well, uh--

904
01:05:27,414 --> 01:05:29,746
Well, like you say, uh,
a guy'll say anything.

905
01:05:29,817 --> 01:05:32,251
So why isn't
Eddie Dane here?

906
01:05:34,021 --> 01:05:36,649
Well, he don't
care for you, kid.

907
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:40,660
Maybe it's only fair to tell you.

908
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:44,220
After you left us,
he tried to sell me
on a double-cross.

909
01:05:44,298 --> 01:05:47,199
He says tome,
why don't we double-cross you
and give you the bump...

910
01:05:47,268 --> 01:05:49,202
after we get the shmatte.

911
01:05:49,270 --> 01:05:53,263
Well, I figure a deal's a deal.
You're square with me.

912
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:57,340
You bump the shmatte,
I hold up my end.
It's a question of ethics.

913
01:05:58,145 --> 01:06:02,145
Everything above board so
everybody knows who's a friend,
whos an enemy.

914
01:06:03,817 --> 01:06:07,014
So the Dane doesn't like you,
but he wouldn't cross me.

915
01:06:07,087 --> 01:06:09,021
We go back.

916
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:14,925
Of course there's always
that wild card when,
uh, love is involved.

917
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:21,200
I know Mink
is Eddie Dane's boy.

918
01:06:23,203 --> 01:06:25,763
Still, I--
I don't make it that way.

919
01:06:27,608 --> 01:06:30,975
- Then there's nothing
to worry about.
- Yeah.

920
01:06:31,045 --> 01:06:35,045
Papa, Papa, I got a prize
from the sister! Papa, Papa,
I got a prize from the sister!

921
01:06:35,449 --> 01:06:38,850
- Papa, Papa, I got a prize
from the sister!
- Yeah. Just a minute.

922
01:06:38,919 --> 01:06:41,114
- Of course, then, there's
no reason-- Shut up!
- Papa, Papa, I got--

out of this guy's book.

924
01:06:44,658 --> 01:06:48,658
- A little less you talk,
a little more you think!
- [ Bawling ]

Kids. You gotta be firm.

926
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:57,400
Anyways, there's no reason
not to check things out.

927
01:06:58,205 --> 01:07:01,606
If Mink is around,
I want you to find him.
He can tell us what's what.

928
01:07:01,675 --> 01:07:04,735
What's the matter?
Somebody hit you?

929
01:07:04,812 --> 01:07:07,645
What's the matter?
Aren't we friends anymore?

930
01:07:07,715 --> 01:07:10,650
If you find him,
I wanna talk to him alone.

931
01:07:10,718 --> 01:07:13,346
That's the way you get
the straight dope--man to man.

932
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:17,117
Just me, Mink...
and my friend Roscoe.

933
01:07:17,191 --> 01:07:19,853
You understand
what I'm saying?

934
01:07:19,927 --> 01:07:22,361
- It ain't complicated.
- [Boy Howling]

935
01:07:33,073 --> 01:07:37,073
You should leave town
for a few days. Things are
gonna heat up around here.

936
01:07:37,611 --> 01:07:40,045
Go to the Palisades.
I'll join you soon as I'm done.

937
01:07:40,114 --> 01:07:43,049
I can't find Bernie.
Did you find him?

938
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:46,285
Yeah.

939
01:07:46,353 --> 01:07:48,548
Is he leaving?

940
01:07:48,622 --> 01:07:52,622
He, uh-- He left.

941
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:55,654
- He say where to?
- He didn't say.

942
01:07:55,729 --> 01:07:57,924
- You--
- Thanks.

- [Thug]Beats me.

01:08:14,982 --> 01:08:17,450
- That's Bernie's sister, ain't it?
- Beats me.

945
01:08:17,518 --> 01:08:19,918
- What's he seeing her for?
- Beats me. Maybe--

946
01:08:19,987 --> 01:08:23,753
Shut up. Get lost.

947
01:08:23,824 --> 01:08:26,384
I'll see where
the twist fops.

948
01:08:27,594 --> 01:08:31,086
You know who I am?

949
01:08:31,165 --> 01:08:33,827
Yeah, Johnny Caspar's shadow.
What, did he stay in bed today?

Jesus. I open my mouth,
the whole world turns smart.

- You're Leo's twist, right?
- Me and Leo are through.

01:08:41,575 --> 01:08:44,339
Yeah?
So youre sluttin' around
with Tom now, huh?

01:08:44,411 --> 01:08:47,175
You get outta here.

01:08:47,247 --> 01:08:49,545
Okay. See you later.

what's your boyfriend up to?

- Nothing I know about.
- Yeah?

who put a bullet in your brother.

looked-out for.

01:09:36,096 --> 01:09:40,096
Well, you did a bang-up job.
I'll be sure to tell him.

965
01:09:40,367 --> 01:09:44,367
- Where's Leo?
- If I tell you, how do I know
you won't kill me?

966
01:09:44,505 --> 01:09:48,505
Because if you told me and I
killed you and you were lying,
I wouldn't get to kill you then.

01:09:49,743 --> 01:09:52,439
- Where's Leo?
- He's moving around.

968

- He's getting his mob together
tomorrow at Whiskey Nick's.
- You sure?

01:09:56,683 --> 01:09:58,617
Check it. It's gold.

Hello, Bernie. Come on in.

Hello, Tom.

979
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:40,806
I thought I'd do that,
since you didn't seem to be in.

980
01:11:40,877 --> 01:11:44,877
Figured it was a bad idea
to wait in the hall, seeing
as I'm supposed to be dead.

who'd knock and then break in.

wouldn't break in?

My other friends
want to kill me,
so they wouldn't knock.

I'm supposed to be
gone far away.

988
01:12:11,408 --> 01:12:14,502
I guess it seems sort of
irresponsible, my being here.

01:12:17,013 --> 01:12:20,505
And I was gonna leave.
Honest, I was.

990
01:12:20,584 --> 01:12:22,518
But then I started thinking...

991
01:12:22,586 --> 01:12:25,453
if I stuck around,
that would not be good for you.

992
01:12:25,522 --> 01:12:28,252
Then I started
thinking that--

993
01:12:28,325 --> 01:12:30,759
that might not
be bad for me.

It's a painful memory...

and I can't help remembering
that you put the finger on me,

and you took me out there
to whack me.

to watch you squirm.

it ruins it.

There's one other thing I want.

1021
01:14:21,604 --> 01:14:24,368
I want to see Johnny Caspar
cold and stiff.

1022

That's what youll do
for your friend Bernie.

In the meantime,
I'll stay out of sight.

But if Caspar ain't stiff
in a couple of days...
