1
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:09,128
Just tell him, damn it! 

2
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,297
- Tell him to give him coffee.
- You tell him! 

3
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:12,507
Give me that! 

4
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,885
Look, get him some coffee or cookies. 

5
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:54,257
I know that! 

6
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,591
Give me the phone. 

7
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:43,532
Hey! 

8
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,202
Where do you think you're going?

9
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,079
Going home.

10
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:51,290
Hey. Hey! 

11
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,334
Officer.

12
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:39,880
The guy walked into the bushes,
maybe to pee, but he never came back.

13
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,590
Do you need help?

14
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,426
Do you own this car?

15
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,345
That's not him.
The guy walked into the bushes.

16
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,222
He said he was going home.

17
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,724
Going home?

18
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:52,560
Gentlemen, return to your cars.

19
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,020
What about the car?

20
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,272
I'll radio for a tow truck.

21
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:59,859
Let's shove it out of the way. 
We'll get this lane moving!

22
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:01,861
It's dangerous.

23
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:06,282
We got a lot of glass and steel
rushing by us at high speeds.

24
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:08,534
Wait a minute.

25
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:13,205
Prendergast. Downtown Robbery.
Let's go.

26
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:15,124
I'm in linoleum tile, myself.

27
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,294
All right.
You, back in your vehicle.

28
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,546
You push. I'll steer.

29
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:27,011
We do ceramics too.
Special discount for law officers.

30
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:31,932
I love <i>Cops,</i> the TV show.
Don't you watch it? I never miss it.

31
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,642
You're lucky you caught me.

32
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:34,894
I am?

33
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,563
Today's my last day as a cop.

34
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:39,982
Lucky me.

35
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,278
Don't touch it!

36
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:47,156
Don't touch it!
Just get this lane moving.

37
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,325
Okay. Sorry.

38
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,661
Officer?

39
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:55,664
Officer?

40
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,261
Oh, my God! The phone!

41
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,014
Come on, baby.

42
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,977
Watch your fingers.

43
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:19,355
Take Tucker, okay?

44
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,320
Hello? 

45
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,156
<i>Mom?</i>

46
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:30,366
<i>Hello?</i> 

47
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,494
Mom, can you help me open this?

48
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:36,956
Hello?

49
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,833
Can I get some change 
for the phone, please?

50
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,752
No change. 
Have to buy something.

51
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,178
- Eighty-fie sen.
- What?

52
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,721
Eighty-fie sen.

53
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,141
- I don't understand.
- Eighty-fie sen!

54
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,478
Eighty-five cents?

55
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:26,315
It doesn't give me enough money
for the phone call.

56
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:33,322
I'll give you 50 cents.
You give me 50 cents change.

57
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:36,325
- No way.
- Yes, way.

58
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,453
Drink, eighty-fie sen.
You pay or go!

59
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:43,624
I don't understand "fie."
There's a "V" in the word "five."

60
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,000
No "V's" in China?

61
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,920
- Not Chinese. I'm Korean.
- Whatever.

62
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:52,800
You come to my country, take my money
and don't even learn my language?

63
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,596
You're Korean?

64
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:02,518
Do you have any idea how much money
my country has given your country?

65
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:03,852
How much?

66
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:09,024
I don't know. It's a lot.
You can bet on that.

67
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:11,694
You go now! No trouble!

68
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,156
I stay.

69
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,200
What do you think of that?

70
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,537
Where are you going?
You got a bat?

71
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,872
What are you doing?
That bat--

72
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,922
Let go. Let go!

73
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,512
Jesus Christ! What is this?

74
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,348
The last stand on Fiji?

75
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,394
- Take the money! Take the money!
- What?

76
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,895
Take the money.

77
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:50,274
Take your hands away from your--
I can't under-- Stop it!

78
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:55,154
All right.
Speak slowly and distinctly.

79
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,697
Take the money.

80
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,913
You think I'm a thief?

81
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,585
You see, I'm not the thief.

82
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,796
I'm not the one charging 85 cents
for a stinking soda!

83
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:14,548
You're the thief!

84
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:21,847
I'm just standing up
for my rights as a consumer.

85
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:27,561
I'm rolling back prices to 1965.
What do you think of that?

86
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,276
Doughnuts. Package of six.
How much?

87
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:35,819
$1.12.

88
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:40,115
Too much.

89
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,204
Aspirin. Price?

90
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:46,622
$3.40.

91
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,457
Oh, please!

92
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:57,299
AA batteries. Package of four.

93
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,053
$4.29.

94
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,390
Nice try.

95
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,934
This whole shelf looks suspect.

96
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,949
One soda...

97
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,492
12 ounces.

98
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:26,578
Fifty sen!

99
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,291
Sold.

100
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,854
It's been a pleasure
frequenting your establishment.

101
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,324
Very funny.

102
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,535
Very, very funny.

103
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:10,289
Genuine Arizona sand, Prendergast. 
Get used to it.

104
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,540
I bet.

105
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,042
Genuine Santa Monica sand's
more like it.

106
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:18,547
It's from my cat's litterbox,
but he said you could keep the lumps.

107
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,469
You took my stuff out first?

108
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,387
Heck, no. 
How fun would that be?

109
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:29,475
- How do I get a pen out?
- Don't need no pen. Use the cat turd.

110
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:35,439
It's your last day. Be careful.
Remember Forsythe?

111
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,401
- Forsythe got 5 minutes to retirement.
- Two!

112
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:43,363
Two minutes, nothing! 
The guy was on the way to his fucking car.

113
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:46,867
Mowed down by a runaway impound.
Nasty.

114
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,869
- Ironic.
- Ironic as fuck!

115
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,038
Anything can happen today.

116
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,832
You know how dangerous a desk can be.

117
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,585
Watch out for paper cuts.

118
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:58,545
Funny, funny, funny.

119
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:01,548
Sorry.
I tried to dissuade them.

120
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:05,344
Hey, Sandra.
It's obligatory, I guess.

121
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,681
Now, what else do they have 
up their sleeve?

122
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,684
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

123
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:17,606
Are we still on for lunch?
You're not going home early?

124
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:19,233
Why would I go home early?

125
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,276
Last day and all.

126
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:22,903
I'm not superstitious.

127
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,364
- Sandy, you ready?
- In a minute.

128
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,033
Leave the poor desk jockey alone.

129
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:30,118
See if you know how to start the car.

130
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:33,705
Let's not get our pantyhose in a bind.

131
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,208
I'll miss you, Prendergast.

132
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:39,294
You really will? Me too.

133
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,880
Come on, let's go!

134
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,341
- Lunch?
- Yup. 

135
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,782
- Mommy! 
- Just a second, baby.

136
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,952
When will we make the strawberry cake?

137
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,621
Soon. I thought sundown would be good.

138
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,915
- Here. Not in the house.
- Okay, mom.

139
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,836
Just a few kids. 
I didn't want to do a whole big thing.

140
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,797
No.

141
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,541
Prendergast here.

142
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,543
- Hi.
<i>- Hello?</i>

143
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,795
- It's me.
<i>- Hi.</i> 

144
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:08,175
I wish you were home.
Wouldn't you come home now?

145
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,052
What's wrong?

146
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,845
<i>I don't know.</i>

147
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:15,223
I got a little scared....

148
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,227
I'd really like you to come home.

149
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:22,230
What is it, honey?

150
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,903
I don't know.
I was wrapping some...

151
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:31,073
some glasses up and some things...

152
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:35,077
and I got really scared.

153
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:41,917
You're not doing this move
just for me, are you?

154
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,920
You really want to do it, don't you?

155
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:48,924
The important thing is we're together.
That's what counts.

156
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,551
Yeah, but you're not here.

157
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,012
Well, I will be soon, baby.

158
00:16:58,518 --> 00:16:59,768
Say it.

159
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:04,356
<i>- Say it!</i>
- I'll be home soon.

160
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,525
No, say it!

161
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:10,946
I'll be home soon, and I love you.

162
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,158
I love you too.

163
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,955
- Feel better?
- No, I don't feel better!

164
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:25,419
<i>London Bridge is falling down</i>

165
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,963
<i>Falling down, falling down</i>

166
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,382
<i>London bridge is falling down</i>
Help me.

167
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,927
<i>My fair lady</i>

168
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,888
You my fair lady?

169
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,227
Yes.

170
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:48,066
<i>- Bye.</i>
- Bye-bye.

171
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:39,367
What you doing, mister?

172
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,453
Nothing.

173
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,372
You're trespassing on private property.

174
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,208
- Trespassing?
- Loitering too.

175
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,627
That's right.
You're loitering too.

176
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,171
I didn't see any signs.

177
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,548
What you call that?

178
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:58,053
- Graffiti?
- No, man.

179
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:02,057
That's not fucking graffiti!
That's a sign.

180
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,392
He can't read it, man.

181
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,355
I'll read it for you.
It says this is private property.

182
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:11,191
No fucking trespassing.

183
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,568
This means fucking you!

184
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,739
-It says all that?
- Yeah!

185
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:21,368
If you wrote it in English,
I'd fucking understand it!

186
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,287
- Thinks he's being funny.
- I'm not laughing.

187
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,207
- I'm not either.
- Hold it, fellas.

188
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,252
We're getting off on the wrong foot.

189
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:36,049
This is a gangland thing, isn't it?

190
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:39,845
We're having a territorial dispute?

191
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:45,267
I've wandered into your pissing ground
or whatever the damn thing is...

192
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,687
and you're offended by my presence.
I understand that.

193
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:52,524
I mean, I wouldn't want you people
in my back yard, either.

194
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,442
This is your home...

195
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,362
and your home is your home.
I respect that.

196
00:19:57,572 --> 00:20:01,867
So if you would just back up
a step or two...

197
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,619
I'll take my problems elsewhere.

198
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:07,289
Fair enough?

199
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,541
- What do you think?
- He should pay a toll.

200
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,543
Good idea.

201
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,837
You should pay a toll.

202
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,214
Listen, fellas...

203
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,551
I've had a rare morning.
I'm not in the mood to--

204
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:20,969
What should he pay?

205
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,804
How about that briefcase?

206
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,390
Good idea.

207
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,143
Give us your briefcase, man.

208
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,481
I'm not giving you my goddamn briefcase.

209
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,860
Motherfucker, give us
your motherfucking briefcase!

210
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,240
Okay.

211
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,868
Okay.

212
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:48,246
I was willing to mind my own business.

213
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:53,126
I was willing to respect your territory
and treat you like a man.

214
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:54,920
You couldn't let a man...

215
00:20:55,171 --> 00:21:00,133
sit here for five minutes to rest
on your precious piece-of-shit hill?

216
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:06,014
Want my briefcase?
I'll get it for you, all right?

217
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,850
You want my briefcase?
Here's my briefcase!

218
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,151
Where are you going?

219
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:20,362
You forgot the briefcase!

220
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:30,914
I'm going home!
Clear the path, you motherfucker!

221
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:33,708
Clear the path!

222
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,002
I'm going home!

223
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:58,316
How'd they do that?

224
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:03,071
- Gun!
- What?

225
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,866
You're leaving today, right?
I gotta get your gun.

226
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:09,077
Right.

227
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:14,708
I need your John Doe right here, 
here and here.

228
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,552
Got time to take a statement?

229
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,096
I know you wanna go
before you get killed....

230
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,724
Yeah, Brian, I'm still working here.

231
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:32,600
This guy's a little excited.

232
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:35,228
Mr. Lee, come on in.

233
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,358
What'd he say?

234
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,528
You know, I don't know.
Mr. Lee is Korean.

235
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:47,115
I'm Japanese, in case
you never bothered to notice.

236
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:50,118
- Mr. Lee, speak English, okay?
- Sure.

237
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:51,911
Sit down.

238
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:57,000
He'll help you. Mr. Lee owns a market.
He was hit less than an hour ago.

239
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:59,627
Sorry, Mr. Lee, no smoking.

240
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:04,299
Mr. Lee, let's just start off
with what he looked like.

241
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:09,054
White man, white shirt, tie.

242
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,931
- What color was his tie?
- Color?

243
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:17,312
I don't know color.
The guy attack me, okay?

244
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,023
He bust up my store.
I'm lucky to be alive.

245
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:23,651
Just try and relax.
What did he steal from you?

246
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:26,154
Did not steal!
Attack me, okay?

247
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,282
Say he fix my prices.
Bust up my merchandise.

248
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:30,492
He didn't rob you?

249
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:33,787
The guy crazy! 
I told him, "Take my money."

250
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:38,583
He say no. He call me "thief,"
then he break up my merchandise.

251
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,668
Then he buy a soda and take off.

252
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:43,463
He bought a soda. 
He paid for it?

253
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,924
I told you, the guy crazy.

254
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,259
Sorry, I thought this was a robbery.

255
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:51,638
Mr. Lee, we have to go talk 
to somebody else.

256
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:55,058
- You were assaulted, this man works robberies. 
- Robberies?

257
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:57,185
That's right. Come on.

258
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,981
- Baseball bat!
- What's that?

259
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:04,984
- The guy take my baseball bat.
- You sell bats?

260
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,822
No, keep for defense.
Under counter. Defense.

261
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:12,534
You mean he stole your baseball bat
but paid for the soda?

262
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,160
This guy's discriminating.

263
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,871
That still doesn't count.
Let's go. Thanks.

264
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:23,169
Go to the hospital.
Your arm might be broken!

265
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:26,047
We'll look for this guy,
so shut the fuck up!

266
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:29,801
What did this guy do?
Threaten you with his credit card?

267
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,636
I told you he had a bat!

268
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:35,181
If this guy's still around,
we'll find him and fuck him up.

269
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:36,891
Then you go to the hospital?

270
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:38,393
Shut up!

271
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:48,403
Hello?

272
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,407
Hello?

273
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:58,079
Cut the crap. I know it's you.
What do you want?

274
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:03,084
<i>It is you, isn't it?</i>

275
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,211
Yeah.

276
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:06,671
Yeah, it's me.

277
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,720
You gotta stop calling me.

278
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,764
It's Adele's birthday.

279
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,268
Yes, I know.
What do you want?

280
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,106
I'm coming home.

281
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,358
What are you talking about?

282
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,778
I just....

283
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:35,408
I want you to know that
I'm coming home for her birthday.

284
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,911
You're not coming here.

285
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,873
Listen, Beth...

286
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,628
I gotta see you.

287
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:52,800
No, you listen to me.
This is my house now. I pay the rent.

288
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:54,928
You don't pay child support.

289
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:59,390
<i>- You just can't walk in and out.</i>
- Don't talk like that, Beth.

290
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,561
I have to come home.

291
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:05,980
I have to bring her a present.

292
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:10,485
You know you can't come here!

293
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:18,451
Hey!

294
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,832
It's him! It's him, man!

295
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:28,670
How's Adele?

296
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:32,257
This isn't your home anymore.

297
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,096
How is she?

298
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,308
She's doing just fine without you.

299
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:46,604
- Angie, get out.
- Come on, man.

300
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:50,316
It's fucking broad daylight!
This shit ain't worth it!

301
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,777
- Get the fuck out!
- Get out of the car!

302
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,862
Give me one. Give me one.

303
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:58,866
- And you?
- Don't.

304
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,870
I'll call the police.

305
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:04,539
Go, go, go!

306
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,834
- I'm coming home.
- No.

307
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,046
- I'm coming home.
- No.

308
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,687
Did you get him?

309
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:29,332
You missed.

310
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,432
I missed too.

311
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:00,780
No, don't fucking do it!

312
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,493
No, man.
Fuck you, mother--!

313
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:10,998
There, you see?

314
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:15,002
That's the concept.

315
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,847
Take some shooting lessons, asshole!

316
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:49,829
She's open.

317
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,295
Prendergast.

318
00:29:58,005 --> 00:29:59,422
Have a seat.

319
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,340
Captain.

320
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:08,806
Did you hear?

321
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,892
The drive-by shooting?

322
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,894
Disgusting!

323
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:16,063
You know who'll have to take
the heat again...

324
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,816
when the shit hits the fan.

325
00:30:24,907 --> 00:30:27,158
You're retiring a little early.

326
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:30,077
You won't be getting your full pension.

327
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:33,581
Yes, sir, that's right.
I won't.

328
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,878
This isn't because you were wounded, is it?

329
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,216
Wounded?

330
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:45,092
Because, I mean...

331
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,887
you're behind a desk now.

332
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,264
Not much chance of getting wounded there.

333
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:54,060
Look, captain, 
it has nothing to do with that.

334
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:00,525
I'll make my speech.

335
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,569
They make me do this, you understand.

336
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:06,989
I hate to lose a good cop.

337
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:10,535
Not too late to change your mind.

338
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:14,288
Lot of good cops want to drop
the whole kit and caboodle.

339
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,040
And who wouldn't?

340
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,500
The pay stinks...

341
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:21,504
and you're up to your ears
in human scum 16 hours a day.

342
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,633
But it gets in your blood.

343
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:29,470
A lot of good cops
get to the point of...

344
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:31,931
slapping their badge down
on this desk...

345
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:36,143
and find they just can't do it.
How about you?

346
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,604
Will you stick with the team?

347
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,318
No, captain.
I don't think I will.

348
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:52,535
Like I say, they make me ask.
You understand.

349
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:55,121
How are the kids?

350
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,082
I don't have any.

351
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:01,002
What the hell?

352
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:05,131
I'd like to take my stick
to these clerks.

353
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:09,927
- The file says--
- We lost a child.

354
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,431
- Lost it?
- Her. Lost her.

355
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:16,267
Yes, of course. Her.
That's rough.

356
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:20,313
Well, it can be.
Yes, sir.

357
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,777
Still married, right?

358
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:29,697
Yes, sir, I am.

359
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,873
That's good.

360
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:49,568
Where you going?

361
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:51,445
- I'm going home.
- Not this way.

362
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:55,074
- Why not?
- Metrorail construction, that's why not.

363
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:57,284
Go around.

364
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:59,412
Just follow your tootsies.

365
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:04,458
You sure you don't want something?
Coffee, soda, something?

366
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,669
No, thank you, ma'am.

367
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:09,797
I feel kind of stupid about this.

368
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,924
Better safe than sorry.

369
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,759
That's what I thought.

370
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,679
You have a restraining order
against your husband?

371
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,222
Ex-husband.

372
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:20,975
He'd show up on the wrong day...

373
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:24,979
or in the middle of the night,
pounding on the door.

374
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,982
Thing is, he has this horrendous temper.

375
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:31,235
I didn't know if a restraining order 
was a good idea...

376
00:34:31,445 --> 00:34:33,571
and if it'd do more harm than good.

377
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:37,491
But the judge said 
we should make an example of him.

378
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:41,954
So he can't come within 100 feet of us.

379
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:45,499
Or is it yards?
Which is it? Feet or yards?

380
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:47,209
That's up to the judge.

381
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:50,337
- I thought it was a set thing.
- It's at his discretion.

382
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,922
That's interesting.

383
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:53,132
Does he drink?

384
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,970
Oh, I thought you meant the judge!

385
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,015
- No, I wouldn't say so.
- Do drugs?

386
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,683
Oh, no.

387
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,811
But he has a propensity for violence?

388
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:08,856
Yeah, I think you could say that.

389
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,359
Did he strike the little girl?

390
00:35:13,487 --> 00:35:16,113
- Well, no.
- Did he strike you?

391
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:18,532
Not exactly.

392
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,285
Not exactly?

393
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,957
You know, there were times...

394
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:29,376
when I thought he was going to...

395
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:33,047
but I just didn't want to wait
until he got around to it.

396
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:40,054
It's hard to explain.

397
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,850
He could, I think.

398
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:46,352
You think?

399
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:55,629
Hello, sir.
How are you today?

400
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:57,131
I'm doing all right.

401
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:59,425
- How about you?
- Me? I'm terrible.

402
00:36:59,593 --> 00:37:00,593
I'm sorry.

403
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:04,722
I came from Santa Barbara,
and my friend wasn't home...

404
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,056
and he owes me money...

405
00:37:06,308 --> 00:37:08,350
so I have no money to go home.

406
00:37:08,602 --> 00:37:11,395
I'm almost out of gas.
I had to sleep in my car.

407
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:14,607
Do you have a few bucks?
It would really help me out.

408
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:17,651
Give me your address,
I'll mail it back. Honest.

409
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:21,071
- Let me see your driver's license.
- What for?

410
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:23,282
It'll have your address on it.

411
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:26,744
- I don't have a license.
- You drove all the way without it?

412
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,162
Are you a cop?

413
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:30,664
Let's see your car registration
and your car.

414
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:34,793
All right, forget it.
Okay, just forget it!

415
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:38,589
That's a hell of a way
to treat a vet, man.

416
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:44,094
- You're an animal doctor?
- No, a veteran. I was in Nam.

417
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,764
You must've been 10 years old.

418
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,308
I meant to say the Gulf.

419
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,519
Come on! 
All I'm asking for is a little change.

420
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,522
I haven't eaten in three days.

421
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:58,150
Well, I mean, except for this.

422
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:02,404
Fuck it! Give me some money, man.
Just give me some money.

423
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:05,491
How about a dime?
Give it to me.

424
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,034
I'm not giving you any.

425
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:09,036
- You got a cigarette?
- No.

426
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:12,623
- You gotta give me something.
- Why don't you get a job?

427
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:15,209
This is my park. I live here!

428
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:18,671
Who are you, 
walking through my park with two bags?

429
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,048
I don't got any. 
Is that fair?

430
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:24,343
What's in those bags, anyway?
Give me one.

431
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:27,930
I could sell those bags
and eat for a week with the money.

432
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:30,975
You've got two of them.
Why do you need two?

433
00:38:31,685 --> 00:38:33,185
You're right.

434
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:34,561
Here.

435
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:37,564
- Are you serious?
- I don't need it anymore.

436
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:43,946
All right! Come on, now.
Come on. What the--

437
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:50,703
Son of a bitch!

438
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,754
- Can we cut the crap this time?
- I'm telling you the truth!

439
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:02,381
Yeah, right.

440
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,680
- What's up?
- She was at the drive-by.

441
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:12,433
- Angie, who hit your guys?
- I told you.

442
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,186
We know. The big bad white man.
We're not buying it.

443
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:18,230
Who are you protecting?

444
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:22,401
They put your boyfriend in the hospital.
He's probably dead.

445
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,362
Do you realize that?
He's probably fucking dead!

446
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:28,866
- Stop saying that!
- You picked a good day to leave.

447
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:32,119
You want another 3-year-old
to get shot in the head?

448
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,871
Is that what you want?

449
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:39,793
Tell me the truth!

450
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:42,796
I'm telling you the truth!

451
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:45,049
It was a white guy!

452
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,635
- Why would he go for your friends?
- I don't know!

453
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:52,723
He attacked them on Angel's Flight Hill
with a baseball bat!

454
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:54,933
A baseball bat?
Wait!

455
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:58,896
Baseball bat.
What did this guy look like?

456
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:02,066
I don't know.
He looked like you...

457
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:04,068
except he was taller and had hair.

458
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,153
Good description, Angie!

459
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,155
Did he wear a white shirt and tie?

460
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:12,993
Come over here, will you?

461
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,414
We gotta keep the pressure on her.
Don't interrupt.

462
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:18,749
What about the bat?

463
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,002
- The white shirt and tie!
- What will she think of next?

464
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,171
I'm sorry you're leaving,
but you are.

465
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:28,509
- Sanchez, listen to me!
- Check me later, babe.

466
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:35,808
Hey, Brian? 

467
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:38,143
Remember that storekeeper,
the Korean guy?

468
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:39,853
- Mr. Lee?
- Come here.

469
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,272
Where was his place?

470
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,191
Right there.

471
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,652
He was assaulted sometime after 8 a.m.?

472
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:50,864
- About that.
- And the drive-by was here, right?

473
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:52,116
What's going on?

474
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:56,495
I may be nuts, but Angel's Flight Hill
is between those two spots.

475
00:40:56,704 --> 00:41:00,165
- It was a classy neighborhood.
- It's a shit hole. Gangland.

476
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:04,711
I know. What would a white guy
in a shirt and tie be doing in...

477
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:06,338
gangland?

478
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:22,688
Hi. Can I help you?

479
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:27,067
I'd like a ham and cheese Whamlette,
an order of Wham fries--

480
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,654
Sorry, we stopped serving breakfast.
We're on the lunch menu.

481
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:32,573
I want breakfast.

482
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:34,616
We're not serving it.

483
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:37,244
So you said.

484
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:39,663
Is that the manager?

485
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:41,081
Yeah.

486
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,916
Could I speak to him, please?

487
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:45,127
Sure.

488
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,005
Rick, a customer would like
to speak to you.

489
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:53,260
- Yes, sir.
- I'd like some breakfast.

490
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,929
We stopped serving breakfast.

491
00:41:56,181 --> 00:42:01,268
I know you stopped breakfast, Rick.
Sheila told me you stopped....

492
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:04,730
Why am I calling you by first names?
I don't know you.

493
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:09,610
I call my boss "mister" after 7 years,
but I walk in here, a stranger...

494
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:14,031
and I'm calling you Rick and Sheila
like we're in an AA meeting.

495
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:18,911
I don't want to be your buddy, Rick.
I just want a little breakfast.

496
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:21,788
You can call me Miss Folsom
if you want to.

497
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,958
We stopped serving breakfast at 11:30.

498
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:40,641
Have you ever heard the expression,
"The customer is always right"?

499
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:42,226
Yeah.

500
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:45,896
Well, here I am.

501
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:48,440
The customer.

502
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,484
That's not our policy.

503
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:53,820
You have to order something
from the lunch menu.

504
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:57,491
I don't want lunch.

505
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,076
I want breakfast.

506
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:01,912
Yeah, well, hey, I'm really sorry.

507
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:04,581
Yeah, well, hey, I'm really sorry too!

508
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,166
He's got a gun!

509
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,418
Let's get organized!

510
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:10,087
Calm down!

511
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:13,215
Just calm down, everybody.
Sit down over there!

512
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:15,968
Mister.

513
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:18,720
Where are you going?

514
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:21,932
No. You sit down there,
and you finish your lunch.

515
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:26,103
Everybody just relax and take it easy.

516
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,940
Eat your lunch. Please.

517
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,234
You all need your vitamins A, B and--

518
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:36,613
Don't! It was an accident!

519
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:40,200
It's the trigger, it's sensitive.
It's okay!

520
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,538
It's a sensitive trigger.

521
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:50,961
Could I have my breakfast?

522
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:53,297
Yes, sir. Sheila?

523
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:04,391
Rick? Miss Folsom?

524
00:44:05,018 --> 00:44:06,310
You know what?

525
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:08,395
You were right.
I've changed my mind.

526
00:44:09,022 --> 00:44:10,897
I'm going to have some lunch.

527
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:14,526
Could I have 
a double Whammyburger with cheese--

528
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:17,070
- You getting this?
- Yes, sir.

529
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:20,866
And an order of Whammy fries
and, let's see...

530
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:22,659
a Choco-Wham shake.

531
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:25,412
Yes, sir.
Sheila, get his order.

532
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,873
Rick, could you get it for me, please?

533
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:33,754
I feel comfortable calling you Rick
after all we've been through together.

534
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,802
How you doing?

535
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,347
Enjoying your meal?

536
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:48,352
How about you?
Is it good?

537
00:44:52,482 --> 00:44:54,358
And you, ma'am? How's the food?

538
00:44:56,986 --> 00:44:58,612
I think we have a critic.

539
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:03,867
I don't think she likes the special sauce.

540
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:07,454
That's a joke.

541
00:45:08,498 --> 00:45:09,956
Now, here we go.

542
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:11,458
Thank you.

543
00:45:15,505 --> 00:45:17,631
See, this is what I'm talking about.

544
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:19,216
Look at that.

545
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:23,220
See what I mean?
It's plump, juicy, three inches thick.

546
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:31,103
Look at this sorry, miserable, 
squashed thing.

547
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:34,898
Can anybody tell me
what's wrong with this picture?

548
00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:37,859
Anybody?

549
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:40,570
Anybody at all.

550
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:53,250
You guys are partners again!

551
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:56,753
No such luck, Lita.
He's moving to Lake Havasu.

552
00:45:57,088 --> 00:45:59,756
- What's in Lake Havasu?
- London Bridge.

553
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:03,301
- Are you going to England?
- They moved it to Arizona.

554
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,888
- Stone by stone.
- Oh, yeah. I heard about that.

555
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:10,016
You're better off,
because cops get killed.

556
00:46:10,643 --> 00:46:12,811
- What'd we used to get, six?
- Seven.

557
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:14,771
Two sevens.

558
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:22,529
- You all right?
- Yeah.

559
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:25,657
You sure?

560
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:28,660
What?

561
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:35,876
I'm sorry, I wasn't gonna do this.

562
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:38,712
I should just shut up.
It's none of my business.

563
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,422
Tell me.

564
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:43,467
Lake Havasu?

565
00:46:44,594 --> 00:46:46,094
It's nice. We like it.

566
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,637
She likes it.

567
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,056
What'll you do, watch cactus grow?

568
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:51,725
Cacti.

569
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,230
She's not handling middle age too well.

570
00:46:57,482 --> 00:47:01,234
The change of life and all that,
whatever it is that is.

571
00:47:02,612 --> 00:47:03,653
What about you?

572
00:47:03,863 --> 00:47:06,698
Me? It's different,
because she's a woman.

573
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:09,117
Different? I'm a woman.

574
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,578
But she was once very beautiful.

575
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,414
Thanks a lot!

576
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:17,375
You know what I mean.
Come on, come on.

577
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:20,170
She could've been anything.
Anything but a cop's wife.

578
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:21,463
She's high-strung.

579
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:25,675
Don't give me that queen of the hop,
homecoming queen bullshit again.

580
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:27,761
That was a long time ago.

581
00:47:28,638 --> 00:47:30,722
Sandra, you have a career.

582
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:34,267
It's hard to lose your beauty
when that's all you've got.

583
00:47:34,477 --> 00:47:35,810
What about your career?

584
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,438
I'll be okay...

585
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,899
you know, even without you.

586
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:48,365
Sorry to break this up.

587
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:50,700
- Why are you here?
- We got a call.

588
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:52,369
Watch out! Hot plates!

589
00:47:52,662 --> 00:47:55,372
- Don't touch my gun.
- Fuck you!

590
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:58,959
You'll love this one.
Some dickhead went into Whammyburger...

591
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,711
pulled out a gun
when he couldn't get breakfast.

592
00:48:01,963 --> 00:48:04,464
Then he paid for it and left.

593
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,967
- Sorry, Prendergast.
- He paid for it?

594
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:09,344
Yeah. Move your buns.
Let's go.

595
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:10,554
I gotta go.

596
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:11,972
Where was this?

597
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:14,933
Quintero and Fourth.
Bye, ladies.

598
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:18,436
Wait a minute. Wait, wait!

599
00:48:18,813 --> 00:48:21,982
Let me know what this guy 
was wearing, okay?

600
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:26,236
You trying to crack a big one
before you disappear into the desert?

601
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:29,739
Sandra, find out if he's wearing
a white shirt and tie.

602
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:31,449
Let's go, lovebirds.

603
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:33,451
- I gotta go.
- Wait.

604
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:37,163
Something about my wife.
Maybe I never mentioned it.

605
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,166
What?

606
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:44,504
I love her.

607
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:47,424
Let's go!

608
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:16,703
For seven years, I banked here.

609
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:20,582
When I asked them for a loan,
a small loan...

610
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:24,794
they told me that I was not
"economically viable."

611
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:36,306
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.

612
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:39,351
How'd your loan work out?
Did they give you a loan?

613
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:42,520
He must be economically viable!

614
00:49:42,772 --> 00:49:45,857
There's a man with a smiling face.
A happy customer.

615
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:49,778
That's what an economically
viable person looks like!

616
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:03,333
How much is the...?

617
00:50:03,793 --> 00:50:05,627
That is only $3.

618
00:50:09,882 --> 00:50:12,967
I asked them for a small loan.
You know what they told me?

619
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:15,762
I was not economically viable.

620
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,014
That's enough.

621
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:22,310
- I'll buy this.
- Yes, sir. That is $3.

622
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:34,280
I'm going away now!
I'm going away, everybody!

623
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:39,411
This is what happens
if you're not economically viable!

624
00:50:50,131 --> 00:50:51,965
Don't let this happen to you!

625
00:50:53,134 --> 00:50:54,509
Bye, everybody!

626
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:00,807
Don't forget me.

627
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:22,162
I'm sorry.

628
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:24,831
We're leaving now.

629
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:26,541
You are? Really?

630
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:29,502
It doesn't look like
your husband's gonna show.

631
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:34,591
He probably realized he could get 
into trouble if he harassed you.

632
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:38,011
You should call your lawyer
and tell him about it.

633
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:41,848
It's one of those services.
I didn't have much money.

634
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:46,019
Have them call your husband's lawyer,
make it official.

635
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:51,149
In the meantime, lock up.
And if anything else happens, call us.

636
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,860
- Okay, thanks.
- Sure thing.

637
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:10,293
Excuse me. Hey, excuse me!

638
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:14,547
If you haven't noticed,
others are waiting to use the phone.

639
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:17,258
- Others want the phone?
- Right, asshole!

640
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:20,762
Jeez, that's too bad,
because you know what?

641
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:28,478
I think it's out of order.

642
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,280
Yeah, Prendergast.

643
00:52:39,532 --> 00:52:40,698
Hi, it's me.

644
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:43,409
He's eating and resting comfortably now.

645
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:44,786
<i>- Who is?</i>
- Mr. Peepers.

646
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,913
<i>- Good!</i>
- I'm sorry about before.

647
00:52:47,248 --> 00:52:49,165
I really blew my top....

648
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:52,293
That's okay, honey.
Could you hold on one second?

649
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:54,754
- Prendergast.
- White shirt and tie.

650
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,214
Could you hold on?

651
00:52:56,465 --> 00:52:57,549
I gotta go.

652
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,718
Just one second.
It's very important.

653
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:03,930
Detective Torres!
Excuse me.

654
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:07,517
We have about 7 million people
waiting to make a statement.

655
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:10,270
Let me call you right back.

656
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:12,230
What's wrong?
What are you doing?

657
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:15,275
Nothing's wrong.
What do you mean?

658
00:53:15,693 --> 00:53:18,069
- You come home then.
<i>- I can't.</i>

659
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:21,364
It's your last day.
What are they going to do, fire you?

660
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:25,159
There's a lot of red tape.
As soon as I get done, I can go home.

661
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:27,537
I'll call you in a while, okay?

662
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:29,831
Wait a minute. Make a list.

663
00:53:30,082 --> 00:53:32,458
- A list?
<i>- We need boneless chicken...</i>

664
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,085
skinless. Red peppers...

665
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:35,879
<i>not green, red.</i>

666
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:38,006
Honey, hold on one second.

667
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:40,967
I am tying up the phone here.

668
00:53:41,302 --> 00:53:43,761
<i>Just listen for once in your life.</i>

669
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:47,682
<i>A girl at the drive-by 
said a man in a shirt and tie...</i>

670
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:50,852
attacked her homeboys with a baseball bat.

671
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,146
Somebody's let that dog off the leash.

672
00:53:53,981 --> 00:53:55,815
I think you've got last-day-itis.

673
00:53:56,025 --> 00:53:59,277
This man was not swinging a bat.
He has a gym bag full of guns.

674
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:00,987
Miss, do you work here? 

675
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,697
A gym bag?

676
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:06,492
You asked me to tell you what he wore. 
I gotta run.

677
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:08,411
We have to canvass the neighborhood.

678
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:10,163
<i>One more second.</i>

679
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:11,831
Please. It's important.

680
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:15,585
<i>- Why don't you go to the store?</i>
- Why?

681
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:17,295
It's my last day.

682
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:20,506
The guys might want to have
a send off or something.

683
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:22,884
What're they gonna do?
Get some broad...

684
00:54:23,135 --> 00:54:25,887
<i>with tassels dangling,
dancing on your desk?</i>

685
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,847
Course not.

686
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:31,059
Look, while you have been playing cop...

687
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:33,853
I'm at home planning your retirement.

688
00:54:34,063 --> 00:54:36,856
It's over. 
The sooner you get that, the better.

689
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:41,069
<i>You are no longer
in the law-enforcement business.</i>

690
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:44,656
Now, I will expect you
at the usual time. <i>Capito?</i>

691
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:49,118
Sandra, are you mad at me?

692
00:54:50,162 --> 00:54:52,747
- I hate you, but I'm not mad.
- You retiring too?

693
00:54:57,461 --> 00:55:00,254
Just don't leave without saying goodbye.

694
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:01,839
Goodbye.

695
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:04,717
If you go up against this guy...

696
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:06,344
be careful.

697
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:31,220
- Hi.
- Hi.

698
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,139
I'm Nick.

699
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,142
What can I do you for?

700
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:38,478
I'm just looking for some hiking boots.

701
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:41,397
Well, well. 
Hiking boots, huh?

702
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:43,983
Let's see what we got.

703
00:56:44,193 --> 00:56:45,902
These are the top of the line.

704
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:49,030
Scientifically engineered
and all that crap.

705
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:52,784
Guaranteed by some Sierra Club asshole 
not to hurt a chipmunk...

706
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:54,827
if you step on it.

707
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:57,830
Personally, I think they're
for pussies and faggots!

708
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,792
Now these...

709
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,002
are Vietnam jungle boots.

710
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:07,048
Cost half as much,
last twice as long and are great...

711
00:57:07,299 --> 00:57:09,258
for stomping queers!

712
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:13,554
When you're done, you gotta clean out 
the waffle with a stick...

713
00:57:13,806 --> 00:57:16,307
but you can't have everything, right?

714
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:18,768
Forget it.

715
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:21,187
Come on, let's go.

716
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,981
Have a nice day, fellas!

717
00:57:24,233 --> 00:57:26,567
Y'all come back now, you hear?

718
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:28,736
You got a problem, buddy?

719
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:32,907
- Huh? Huh?
- Uh-uh. 

720
00:57:33,534 --> 00:57:34,700
You got the problem!

721
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:37,370
- No, you do, buddy!
- Read the sign!

722
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:39,497
"I reserve the right."

723
00:57:40,332 --> 00:57:41,624
Now take a hike.

724
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:43,584
Make me.

725
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:48,381
Take it easy, Mary.
Take it easy.

726
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:52,051
- Jesus!
- Come on, make your play.

727
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:55,888
Would you just come on!
I don't need this shit today.

728
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:58,266
Fucking redneck!

729
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,227
Fascist!

730
00:58:05,357 --> 00:58:07,650
Fucking faggots!

731
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:09,735
You believe this shit?

732
00:58:11,113 --> 00:58:12,989
Jesus!

733
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:16,534
Alternate lifestyle, my ass!

734
00:58:17,786 --> 00:58:21,372
Imagine what those pumpkins do 
with each other when they're alone!

735
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:25,585
And what about the muff divers?
Think about it.

736
00:58:28,881 --> 00:58:31,257
- Sergeant Prendergast.
- She don't have to talk!

737
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:35,303
What do you want?
I admitted it was a gang!

738
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:37,305
She don't have to say a word!

739
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:42,393
I know it was a white guy.
We gotta talk. It's important.

740
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:48,274
How many guns were in the gym bag?

741
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:52,111
I don't know what you're talking about.
I didn't see no gym bag!

742
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:55,865
The white guy took it, right?
More people could get hurt.

743
00:58:56,116 --> 00:58:57,617
Now help me out.

744
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:02,872
The bag was already in the car
when I got in.

745
00:59:03,123 --> 00:59:04,582
How many guns were in it?

746
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:06,292
I don't know.

747
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:10,129
Lots of guns.

748
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,882
They got all the guns
in the fucking world.

749
00:59:37,616 --> 00:59:38,658
Good?

750
00:59:41,453 --> 00:59:42,453
Hi.

751
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:45,039
Hi.
Can I help you?

752
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:47,541
Police officer.
I'm looking for a man.

753
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:49,752
Are you now?

754
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:51,837
Late 30s...

755
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:53,547
white shirt and tie...

756
00:59:54,508 --> 00:59:56,634
he'd be carrying a gym bag.

757
01:00:02,474 --> 01:00:04,100
What's the police scanner for?

758
01:00:04,977 --> 01:00:06,727
My own personal amusement.

759
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:10,356
Seen anyone like I've described?

760
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:11,565
Nope.

761
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:14,360
- Okay, thanks.
- Listen.

762
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,445
Tell me something.

763
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:19,031
Why don't they call you guys...

764
01:00:19,241 --> 01:00:21,617
officer-esses?

765
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,286
I beg your pardon?

766
01:00:23,495 --> 01:00:27,498
You know, like actress?
Like that?

767
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:32,003
Something to signify...

768
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:34,588
you know.

769
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:40,886
I guess they feel that a police officer
is a police officer...

770
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:42,805
not a...

771
01:00:43,807 --> 01:00:45,224
"you know."

772
01:00:46,685 --> 01:00:48,644
Thanks for your cooperation, sir.

773
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:52,273
Sorry I couldn't be of more help, 
officer-ess.

774
01:01:01,742 --> 01:01:02,742
Why'd you do that?

775
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:05,619
There's something I wanna show you.

776
01:01:06,538 --> 01:01:09,957
I'm not gonna turn you in.
I'm your friend.

777
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:12,126
Come on.

778
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:15,838
I don't bring just anybody back here.

779
01:01:16,048 --> 01:01:18,799
This is my own private stash.

780
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,927
I got some great stuff here.

781
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:29,977
Boo!
World War I. Good shape.

782
01:01:31,355 --> 01:01:33,731
Speaking of gas, wait a minute.

783
01:01:33,982 --> 01:01:35,941
Wait just a minute.

784
01:01:45,994 --> 01:01:47,995
You know what was in this?

785
01:01:48,455 --> 01:01:50,122
Zyklon-B.

786
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:52,375
You remember?

787
01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:53,751
What the Nazis had?

788
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:57,296
Listen.

789
01:02:00,384 --> 01:02:01,467
Empty.

790
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:03,386
This was used, man.

791
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:07,181
This was actually used.

792
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:12,186
I wonder how many kikes
this little can took out.

793
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:15,773
Think about it. 
Here.

794
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:23,864
Why are you showing me this?

795
01:02:24,324 --> 01:02:25,324
I'm not.

796
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:29,495
That's just for fun.
You can keep that.

797
01:02:32,374 --> 01:02:35,000
This is what I want to show you.

798
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,670
The real thing.

799
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:42,049
Heat-seeking, shoulder-fired.
It's fucking disposable!

800
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:44,927
You can take out a jet
with one of these monkeys.

801
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:48,681
It's for you.

802
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:52,351
- I want you to have it.
- Why?

803
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:54,728
Because I'm with you.

804
01:02:55,147 --> 01:02:56,439
Don't you get it?

805
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:59,650
I listened to the scanner.
I heard about Whammyburger.

806
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:02,611
Fucking fantastic!

807
01:03:02,821 --> 01:03:07,241
It's a bunch of niggers, right?
On TV, it's always white kids.

808
01:03:07,451 --> 01:03:10,911
But when you go in there,
it's nothing but a bunch of niggers!

809
01:03:11,413 --> 01:03:14,081
They'll spit on your food
if you're not nice.

810
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:16,333
I know all about it.

811
01:03:17,961 --> 01:03:19,378
I'm with you.

812
01:03:19,588 --> 01:03:22,047
We're the same, you and me.

813
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:23,966
We're the same. Don't you see?

814
01:03:24,176 --> 01:03:26,635
We are not the same.

815
01:03:26,928 --> 01:03:29,680
I'm an American.
You're a sick asshole.

816
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:34,101
What kind of vigilante are you?

817
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:37,146
I am not a vigilante.

818
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:40,691
I'm just trying to get home
for my little girl's birthday.

819
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:46,071
And if everybody will stay out of my way, 
nobody will get hurt.

820
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,240
Fuck you!

821
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:51,243
Who the fuck are you?
Are you fucking with me?

822
01:03:51,453 --> 01:03:54,121
I am just disagreeing with you!

823
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:58,626
In America, we have freedom of speech,
the right to disagree!

824
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,878
Fuck you and your freedom!

825
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:02,755
Who the fuck are you?

826
01:04:02,964 --> 01:04:05,090
You fuck!
You faggot fuck!

827
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:06,717
Gonna take my rocket.

828
01:04:06,927 --> 01:04:10,471
I ought to shoot you, motherfucker!
Now turn around!

829
01:04:10,722 --> 01:04:13,307
Now lean on that counter!
Go on, lean on it!

830
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,899
Look at this shit!

831
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,530
What is this doing in there?

832
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:29,990
- Faggot shit!
- No!

833
01:04:32,202 --> 01:04:36,163
You want freedom, huh?
I'll give you fucking freedom!

834
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:39,041
Further back.
Feet farther back.

835
01:04:39,668 --> 01:04:42,002
Spread them out.
Farther.

836
01:04:42,837 --> 01:04:46,131
You're going to jail, motherfucker!
How's that for freedom?

837
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:49,385
Freedom to get fucked up the ass
by some big buck nigger.

838
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:50,886
Give me your hand.

839
01:04:54,975 --> 01:04:59,353
He's gonna be right behind you,
just like this.

840
01:05:00,564 --> 01:05:03,774
Think about it.
You gonna like that, faggot?

841
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:08,028
You gonna like that, you faggot fuck?
Give me your other hand.

842
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:10,281
- I can't.
- Why not?

843
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:11,574
Gravity.

844
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:14,034
Gravity?
What the fuck does that mean?

845
01:05:14,244 --> 01:05:15,828
I'll fall down.

846
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:20,958
Now give me your other hand!
Give it to me now!

847
01:05:21,501 --> 01:05:23,460
Give it to me! 
Give it to me!

848
01:05:23,837 --> 01:05:24,878
Come on. Come on.

849
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:26,839
Give it to me.

850
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:37,808
Aah!

851
01:05:46,735 --> 01:05:48,444
This isn't one of mine.

852
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:06,629
Oh, my God!

853
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:11,050
- Oh, my God!
- Good!

854
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:13,010
Freedom of religion.

855
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,012
Now you get the swing of it!

856
01:06:15,847 --> 01:06:17,931
Feels good to exercise your rights.

857
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,112
I'm listening.

858
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:35,032
We got a nutcase
with a bag full of guns.

859
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:37,785
He's in Hollywood, heading west.

860
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,161
What is he up to?

861
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:41,538
He's up to a lot of trouble.

862
01:06:41,748 --> 01:06:45,459
Never mind, we've got a hallway 
full of suspects.

863
01:06:45,669 --> 01:06:48,337
It wasn't a gang thing.
I can tell you that.

864
01:06:48,588 --> 01:06:50,673
Angelina is a tramp and a liar.

865
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:54,301
We don't appreciate you interfering
with our investigation.

866
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:58,847
I've got a positive ID
on the gym bag, okay?

867
01:07:01,393 --> 01:07:02,810
What's this?

868
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:04,311
A gym bag.

869
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:07,606
Does this mean you're putting me 
under arrest?

870
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:11,985
You guys take off.

871
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:17,991
I gave you that speech earlier...

872
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:21,704
because that's regulations.
They make me do it.

873
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,707
This one's from me.
I've never liked you.

874
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:29,002
You know why? You don't curse.
I don't trust a man who doesn't curse.

875
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:33,924
Not a "fuck" or a "shit" in all these years. 
Real men curse.

876
01:07:34,342 --> 01:07:37,302
And I don't like a man
who's afraid to hit the street.

877
01:07:37,512 --> 01:07:40,055
- It's bad for morale.
- I'm not afraid.

878
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:42,641
Get back behind that desk
where you belong...

879
01:07:42,934 --> 01:07:46,812
and don't waste any more of my time
pretending you're a cop.

880
01:07:52,861 --> 01:07:57,322
A man in a white shirt and tie shot up
a phone booth near the Whammyburger.

881
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:00,993
- Did you hear me?
- I heard you.

882
01:08:01,828 --> 01:08:03,954
Right about here, right?

883
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:05,831
How did you know?

884
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:08,333
He got the bag of guns at the drive-by.

885
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:09,835
Then you were right.

886
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:11,253
Excuse me.

887
01:08:11,463 --> 01:08:14,089
- What is wrong with you?
- Me?

888
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:17,217
I'm a coward, the captain told me.
Get out of my way.

889
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:19,386
Hey, look. It is your own fault.

890
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:22,556
You let everybody think that,
when it was your wife.

891
01:08:23,141 --> 01:08:24,850
She made you get off the street.

892
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:29,229
What happens between me and my wife
is nobody's business but mine!

893
01:08:29,856 --> 01:08:31,648
Sorry, I've been a bitch all day.

894
01:08:31,858 --> 01:08:34,860
She didn't make me quit.
I came home late one night...

895
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:37,154
and found her sitting in the dark.

896
01:08:37,405 --> 01:08:39,072
She thought I'd been killed.

897
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:42,868
She thought I was a ghost.
I had to chase her all over the house.

898
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:48,123
- I'm sorry.
- Forget it.

899
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:52,002
- Where are you going?
- See if I can earn my last day's pay.

900
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:53,962
Let me go with you.

901
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:57,090
I thought you were on duty.

902
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:01,887
What do you say, partner?

903
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:05,390
Fuck them!

904
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:09,061
Go!

905
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:22,533
Hello?

906
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:26,286
<i>Who were you talking to a while ago?</i>

907
01:09:29,207 --> 01:09:30,707
You're trying to scare me.

908
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:33,460
Am I succeeding?

909
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:37,548
<i>No, you're not succeeding.
So you just might as well stop it.</i>

910
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:41,468
<i>And you're not scaring me
out of my own house.</i>

911
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:42,928
<i>And you're not coming here.</i>

912
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:47,766
But I am. I'm on my way.
You can count on that.

913
01:09:49,853 --> 01:09:52,563
I'm past the point of no return.

914
01:09:54,232 --> 01:09:56,108
Do you know when that is?

915
01:09:57,235 --> 01:09:59,945
That's the point in a journey...

916
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:03,073
where it's longer to go back
to the beginning...

917
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:05,993
than it is to continue to the end.

918
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:09,037
It's like....

919
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:12,040
Remember when those astronauts 
got in trouble?

920
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:15,961
They were going to the moon
and something went wrong.

921
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:17,671
They had to get back to Earth...

922
01:10:17,881 --> 01:10:21,216
but they had passed the point 
of no return.

923
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:26,388
<i>So they had to go all the way
around the moon to get back...</i>

924
01:10:26,598 --> 01:10:30,809
<i>and they were out of contact for hours.</i>

925
01:10:32,395 --> 01:10:35,814
Everybody waited to see
if a bunch of dead guys in a can...

926
01:10:36,024 --> 01:10:38,233
would pop out the other side.

927
01:10:42,113 --> 01:10:43,655
That's me.

928
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,618
On the other side of the moon now...

929
01:10:48,036 --> 01:10:50,120
out of contact...

930
01:10:51,164 --> 01:10:55,042
and everybody's just going
to have to wait till I pop out.

931
01:10:58,129 --> 01:10:59,922
The police are here.

932
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:03,383
<i>Did you know, Beth...</i>

933
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:07,888
that in certain South American countries 
it's still legal...

934
01:11:08,139 --> 01:11:10,849
to kill your wife if she insults you?

935
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:17,064
They're here right now.
I'm looking at one right now.

936
01:11:17,732 --> 01:11:18,815
Put him on the phone.

937
01:11:36,084 --> 01:11:39,336
- What are we gonna do?
- Talk to the Korean guy.

938
01:11:40,672 --> 01:11:43,298
Then we just start banging on doors.

939
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:56,853
What is it?

940
01:12:00,483 --> 01:12:02,484
Where are you going?

941
01:12:02,694 --> 01:12:04,361
I'll be right back.

942
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:09,783
I'm sure the guy 
will let you use his bathroom.

943
01:12:23,297 --> 01:12:25,298
Prendergast, what are you doing?

944
01:12:36,644 --> 01:12:39,021
- I know who this guy is!
- Who is he?

945
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:43,400
He had a personalized license plate.
What the hell was it?

946
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:45,736
It said, "D-Fens."

947
01:12:46,112 --> 01:12:47,112
Defense?

948
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:51,366
D-dash-F-E-N-S.
"D-Fens."

949
01:12:51,743 --> 01:12:55,412
They said he was on his way home.
Go check out his address.

950
01:12:55,955 --> 01:12:56,955
Mr. Lee!

951
01:12:58,458 --> 01:13:00,000
Defense!

952
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:13,221
Honey, honey. No, no. 

953
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:29,279
Hold it! Back up.

954
01:13:33,076 --> 01:13:36,161
You dumb bitch! You cut me off!
What's wrong with you!

955
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:38,038
Move back! 
Out of the way!

956
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:39,706
What are you, a moron?

957
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:44,878
If I wanted to be in a parking lot,
I'd buy a ticket, you dumb bitch!

958
01:14:04,357 --> 01:14:06,274
You can't come this way.

959
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:08,110
What are you doing?

960
01:14:08,528 --> 01:14:10,779
Fixing the street!
What does it look like?

961
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:14,324
Two days ago, it was fine.

962
01:14:14,575 --> 01:14:16,785
You're saying it fell apart in two days?

963
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:19,204
Well, I guess so.

964
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:22,124
Pardon me, but that's bullshit!

965
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:26,378
I don't think anything's wrong 
with the street.

966
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:28,755
You're trying to justify your budgets.

967
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:30,841
- Are you nuts?
- I know how it works.

968
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:35,303
If you don't spend your budget,
you won't get any money next year.

969
01:14:35,805 --> 01:14:38,598
I want you to admit
nothing's wrong with the street!

970
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:40,225
Fuck you, pal!

971
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:45,355
You're not gonna hold us hostage 
with these yellow lights and big trucks.

972
01:14:47,275 --> 01:14:50,443
I'm just here to keep people 
from falling in. That's all.

973
01:14:50,862 --> 01:14:52,863
I want to hear it from you.

974
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:55,991
What's wrong with the street?

975
01:14:56,242 --> 01:14:59,578
I don't know. I really don't.
I think it's a sewer job.

976
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:02,455
You're lying.

977
01:15:02,957 --> 01:15:05,041
What's wrong with the street?

978
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:08,420
Nothing.

979
01:15:10,882 --> 01:15:12,257
I knew it.

980
01:15:12,425 --> 01:15:14,926
See, I knew it was fine.

981
01:15:16,596 --> 01:15:18,763
But I'll give you something to fix.

982
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:21,057
- Oh, Jesus--
- Here!

983
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:24,853
Hey, Charlie!
Oh, please, man!

984
01:15:25,104 --> 01:15:27,147
We got a goddamn nut here!

985
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:31,484
Fucking guy back there with a bazooka!

986
01:15:31,694 --> 01:15:32,777
Pull that thing off.

987
01:15:32,987 --> 01:15:34,154
- What thing?
- That.

988
01:15:34,405 --> 01:15:36,990
Then pull on both ends.
It gets bigger.

989
01:15:38,117 --> 01:15:39,201
Like this?

990
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:42,287
Now flip that thing up.
It's your aimer.

991
01:15:42,496 --> 01:15:43,496
How do you know?

992
01:15:43,706 --> 01:15:45,498
I saw it on TV.

993
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:47,667
What's the name of the movie?

994
01:15:47,919 --> 01:15:50,003
What's the movie you're making?

995
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:53,673
<i>Under Construction.</i> 
You like it?

996
01:15:53,925 --> 01:15:56,092
It's all right.
Where's the cameras?

997
01:15:56,469 --> 01:15:59,179
The cameras are on.
Just stand back.

998
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:02,933
What do I do now?

999
01:16:03,142 --> 01:16:07,395
Just look through the aimer.
What you aiming at?

1000
01:16:09,232 --> 01:16:11,316
That yellow monster down there.

1001
01:16:12,193 --> 01:16:14,945
Look at it and pull the trigger.
It's really easy.

1002
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:16,905
Trigger?

1003
01:16:18,157 --> 01:16:20,242
That one right there.

1004
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:22,953
But aim first, man.

1005
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:25,664
Look out!

1006
01:16:31,462 --> 01:16:35,257
- Nothing happened.
- Must have been a dud or something.

1007
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:48,853
Cool, man!

1008
01:17:00,157 --> 01:17:01,616
What is it?
I'll sic the dog on you!

1009
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:04,035
Police officers, ma'am.

1010
01:17:16,173 --> 01:17:17,590
How are you?

1011
01:17:18,175 --> 01:17:19,926
Where's the dog?

1012
01:17:23,431 --> 01:17:25,098
He's dead.

1013
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:30,312
- What is it?
- We need to ask some questions.

1014
01:17:30,813 --> 01:17:32,897
Just a few questions, ma'am.

1015
01:17:33,107 --> 01:17:35,025
What kind of questions?

1016
01:17:35,234 --> 01:17:37,027
Do you have a warrant?

1017
01:17:37,236 --> 01:17:38,737
You invited us in.

1018
01:17:38,946 --> 01:17:41,281
Now I'm inviting you out.

1019
01:17:41,532 --> 01:17:43,950
What relation are you to William Foster?

1020
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:48,288
What are you saying? He's my son. 
I don't want you here.

1021
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:51,750
Would you look at this?
This is really amazing.

1022
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:52,917
Amazing!

1023
01:17:53,127 --> 01:17:57,005
Does he have another house,
another place he might call home?

1024
01:17:57,256 --> 01:17:58,715
Now, this is a what?

1025
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:01,009
- A dragon?
- Don't touch that!

1026
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:05,347
Why would he do that?
This is his home.

1027
01:18:05,556 --> 01:18:08,516
- I want you to go now.
- Did this one melt?

1028
01:18:09,352 --> 01:18:10,560
That one.

1029
01:18:15,358 --> 01:18:18,276
It's a giraffe, drinking.

1030
01:18:19,153 --> 01:18:20,195
Mm-hm.

1031
01:18:21,614 --> 01:18:24,741
Now, of all of these,
which is your very favorite?

1032
01:18:28,871 --> 01:18:31,039
Right now, I think this skunk.

1033
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:32,874
That's lovely.

1034
01:18:34,001 --> 01:18:35,168
That's not paint.

1035
01:18:35,753 --> 01:18:37,045
You know, his stripe.

1036
01:18:37,296 --> 01:18:38,296
It isn't?

1037
01:18:38,464 --> 01:18:40,965
It might be, but it's not painted on.

1038
01:18:41,801 --> 01:18:44,052
It's in the glass.

1039
01:19:26,303 --> 01:19:28,096
What the hell?

1040
01:19:30,057 --> 01:19:31,057
It's the groundskeeper.

1041
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:34,686
Well, if he is, he's out of uniform. 
Hey, you there!

1042
01:19:35,312 --> 01:19:37,230
What are you doing there?

1043
01:19:37,815 --> 01:19:39,023
Just passing through.

1044
01:19:39,525 --> 01:19:43,194
Nobody said you could play through.
Get off my hole.

1045
01:19:43,404 --> 01:19:45,613
He said he was passing through.

1046
01:19:45,823 --> 01:19:47,824
He's not a member.
Look how he's dressed.

1047
01:19:48,033 --> 01:19:49,742
Get off my golf course!

1048
01:19:50,661 --> 01:19:51,870
I am!

1049
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:53,913
Go back the way you came!

1050
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:56,708
I don't like his looks.
Leave him alone.

1051
01:19:56,917 --> 01:19:59,586
What am I paying dues for?
This is my golf course!

1052
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:02,380
If I want to play here, I will!

1053
01:20:02,590 --> 01:20:05,550
If he gets hit with my Titleist,
that's his problem!

1054
01:20:05,718 --> 01:20:08,470
Don't yell at me.
I'm just here playing with you--

1055
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:10,388
Fore!

1056
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:12,807
Fore!

1057
01:20:19,565 --> 01:20:20,565
Five!

1058
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:22,233
Wait a minute!

1059
01:20:22,443 --> 01:20:26,279
What the hell you trying to do?
Kill me with a golf ball?

1060
01:20:26,697 --> 01:20:29,699
It's not enough you got all this land 
for your little game?

1061
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:32,619
But you had to kill me
with a golf ball?

1062
01:20:33,287 --> 01:20:36,915
You should have children playing here.
Family picnics.

1063
01:20:37,124 --> 01:20:39,125
You should have a petting zoo...

1064
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:44,672
instead of electric carts for you old men 
with nothing better to do.

1065
01:20:50,930 --> 01:20:53,848
Frank, what's wrong? 
Frank!

1066
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:57,602
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

1067
01:20:57,770 --> 01:21:00,855
- I gotta get some help!
- What's wrong with you?

1068
01:21:01,106 --> 01:21:03,149
- Help!
- Your heart?

1069
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:06,277
Something's wrong with your heart?
What can I do?

1070
01:21:07,905 --> 01:21:09,614
Pills! Pills!

1071
01:21:09,782 --> 01:21:10,782
Pills?

1072
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:12,617
Where are they?

1073
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:14,953
Cart, cart.

1074
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:21,209
Call the paramedics!
My friend just had a heart attack!

1075
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:25,338
I guess you're out of luck.
Your little cart's gonna drown.

1076
01:21:25,923 --> 01:21:29,509
Aren't you sorry you didn't let me pass 
through your golf course?

1077
01:21:31,971 --> 01:21:36,808
Now you're gonna die wearing that stupid 
little hat. How does it feel?

1078
01:21:40,521 --> 01:21:42,855
This is his room.

1079
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,650
You're a very neat and tidy lady.

1080
01:21:45,859 --> 01:21:48,403
He cleans his own room.

1081
01:21:49,071 --> 01:21:51,072
Now don't make me call you a liar.

1082
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:56,369
If he wasn't at work,
I'd be afraid to set foot in here.

1083
01:21:56,579 --> 01:21:58,246
What's he been doing lately?

1084
01:21:58,455 --> 01:21:59,914
Same as ever.

1085
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:03,918
Building important things 
to protect us from the Communists.

1086
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:06,296
He works at Notec.

1087
01:22:06,797 --> 01:22:08,506
The defense plant.

1088
01:22:09,174 --> 01:22:10,675
D-Fens.

1089
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:13,886
Call Notec and see if you can get him.

1090
01:22:18,392 --> 01:22:20,602
So what's going on with your son?

1091
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:26,691
- How do you mean?
- You know exactly what I mean.

1092
01:22:31,322 --> 01:22:34,991
Sometimes he sits through an entire meal 
without saying a word.

1093
01:22:38,412 --> 01:22:41,456
He just shovels food into his mouth 
like a machine.

1094
01:22:41,707 --> 01:22:43,750
I get so nervous...

1095
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:46,461
I can't swallow.

1096
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:50,423
I'll sit there with
the same piece of food in my mouth.

1097
01:22:51,759 --> 01:22:54,761
I have to spit it out.
When I do, he looks at me...

1098
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:57,513
like he'd like to kill me.

1099
01:22:59,725 --> 01:23:01,351
Don't tell him I said that.

1100
01:23:01,602 --> 01:23:03,978
I promise I won't.

1101
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:08,775
I try not to be a burden.
I'm not just talking financial.

1102
01:23:09,068 --> 01:23:11,736
How could you be a burden to anyone?

1103
01:23:13,322 --> 01:23:15,782
If William, or Bill,
as I like to call him--

1104
01:23:16,033 --> 01:23:18,951
He likes Bill.
I call him Bill too.

1105
01:23:19,244 --> 01:23:20,953
If Bill said he was going home...

1106
01:23:21,163 --> 01:23:24,248
could he have meant
where his wife and child live?

1107
01:23:24,458 --> 01:23:26,959
Ex-wife.
We shouldn't be in here.

1108
01:23:28,754 --> 01:23:32,590
Ex-wife, right. Elizabeth.
What's her maiden name?

1109
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:35,760
Trevino. She was part Italian.
You know how they are.

1110
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:38,513
- Where's Elizabeth now?
- I wouldn't know.

1111
01:23:40,057 --> 01:23:42,308
You don't know where your grandchild lives?

1112
01:23:43,686 --> 01:23:48,189
He doesn't want me to know.
He blames me for what happened.

1113
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:52,026
What's the word?

1114
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:56,823
- He was fired over a month ago.
- What?

1115
01:24:04,707 --> 01:24:07,375
Where has he been going every day?

1116
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:10,294
Where has he been eating his lunch?

1117
01:24:23,726 --> 01:24:26,310
Why are you putting barbed wire 
on that fence?

1118
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:27,562
Is it a joke?

1119
01:24:27,813 --> 01:24:31,399
Is this how rich people have fun?
You put barbed wire on the fence...

1120
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:34,694
so innocent people like me
can cut our hands?

1121
01:24:36,447 --> 01:24:38,865
No, please. I'm the caretaker.

1122
01:24:39,116 --> 01:24:40,658
It's just a barbecue.

1123
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:44,328
Dr. Ashcroft has let us do this before.

1124
01:24:46,039 --> 01:24:47,623
You don't live here?

1125
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:50,084
Is it really necessary to tell them?

1126
01:24:51,462 --> 01:24:52,670
Tell who?

1127
01:24:53,881 --> 01:24:54,881
Altmore Security.

1128
01:24:56,258 --> 01:24:58,259
Aren't you with them?

1129
01:25:07,478 --> 01:25:09,353
No, please!

1130
01:25:10,522 --> 01:25:12,607
It's okay, honey.
It's okay, baby.

1131
01:25:26,079 --> 01:25:27,997
What kind of doctor lives here?

1132
01:25:29,416 --> 01:25:30,917
Plastic surgeon.

1133
01:25:35,005 --> 01:25:36,964
Plastic surgery bought all this?

1134
01:25:39,009 --> 01:25:41,219
Guess I'm in the wrong racket.

1135
01:25:43,514 --> 01:25:46,641
Are there correspondence courses
in plastic surgery?

1136
01:25:51,522 --> 01:25:53,523
I lost my job.

1137
01:25:53,732 --> 01:25:57,026
Actually, I didn't lose it.
It lost me.

1138
01:25:57,778 --> 01:26:01,572
I'm overeducated, underskilled....

1139
01:26:04,117 --> 01:26:06,577
Maybe it's the other way around.
I forget.

1140
01:26:06,912 --> 01:26:08,746
And I'm obsolete.

1141
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:13,960
I'm not economically viable.

1142
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:20,633
I can't even support my own kid.

1143
01:26:23,637 --> 01:26:25,513
Are you hurt? 
I'm sorry.

1144
01:26:25,764 --> 01:26:27,974
I didn't hurt you, honey.
I'm sorry.

1145
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:31,435
It's all right. It's your hand.

1146
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:34,605
You cut your hand.

1147
01:26:37,818 --> 01:26:39,610
It's my hand.

1148
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:46,701
- Please take me with you.
- No!

1149
01:26:48,036 --> 01:26:50,955
They won't do anything
if I'm with you.

1150
01:26:52,124 --> 01:26:54,000
Just please let them go.

1151
01:26:57,838 --> 01:27:01,382
What do you think?
You think I want to hurt your family?

1152
01:27:05,137 --> 01:27:07,346
I have a family of my own.

1153
01:27:09,308 --> 01:27:10,308
You don't believe me?

1154
01:27:11,727 --> 01:27:13,185
We believe you.

1155
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:20,693
That's where I'm going.
I'm going home to see my family.

1156
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:26,991
It's my little girl's birthday today.

1157
01:27:28,827 --> 01:27:32,788
We were gonna have a barbecue,
like you guys...

1158
01:27:34,207 --> 01:27:36,751
and she was gonna play outside...

1159
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:40,713
and my wife would hold my hand...

1160
01:27:42,049 --> 01:27:44,675
and talk about grownup things.

1161
01:27:48,722 --> 01:27:50,932
And then when it got dark...

1162
01:27:52,184 --> 01:27:54,685
we'd all go to sleep together.

1163
01:27:57,356 --> 01:27:59,899
We'd all sleep together in the dark.

1164
01:28:02,694 --> 01:28:04,528
And everything...

1165
01:28:05,072 --> 01:28:08,032
would be just like it was before.

1166
01:28:17,626 --> 01:28:21,045
You can't leave. Believe me,
something's happened to him.

1167
01:28:21,254 --> 01:28:24,340
It doesn't take all day
to drive from Pasadena to Venice.

1168
01:28:24,549 --> 01:28:27,718
That doesn't constitute
a threatening phone call.

1169
01:28:27,928 --> 01:28:30,388
The guy was talking 
about <i>Star Trek</i> or something.

1170
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:34,141
- He's getting a kick out of scaring you.
- Please don't leave.

1171
01:28:34,393 --> 01:28:38,062
There's only one thing you can do
to really feel safer.

1172
01:28:38,271 --> 01:28:40,231
Next time there's a proposition...

1173
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:44,819
to cut the number of patrol cars 
on the street, vote no, okay?

1174
01:28:45,070 --> 01:28:47,029
Have a nice day.

1175
01:29:04,381 --> 01:29:06,007
What have you found so far?

1176
01:29:06,216 --> 01:29:07,717
No luck on Foster-Trevino.

1177
01:29:07,968 --> 01:29:10,386
Go straight to the maiden name.

1178
01:29:10,887 --> 01:29:13,597
I've got something on an Army-Navy store.

1179
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:16,434
- Where?
- Here.

1180
01:29:17,728 --> 01:29:20,354
Jesus, Prendergast, I was there!

1181
01:29:20,605 --> 01:29:22,106
That guy was a prick.

1182
01:29:22,357 --> 01:29:23,983
You know what else he was?

1183
01:29:24,401 --> 01:29:28,112
Murdered. They found him stuffed
in his own display case.

1184
01:29:28,363 --> 01:29:29,822
Oh, my God!

1185
01:29:30,115 --> 01:29:31,240
Here, I'll help you.

1186
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:39,790
Hello?

1187
01:29:40,292 --> 01:29:41,876
You know what they did?

1188
01:29:42,127 --> 01:29:46,964
They turned our ice-cream parlor 
into a Southwest American, New Age thing.

1189
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:49,133
<i>I went to buy a rocking horse.</i>

1190
01:29:49,342 --> 01:29:52,970
All I could find was a unicorn
with an Indian on top of it.

1191
01:29:53,180 --> 01:29:56,223
Can you believe that, Elizabeth?
Can you believe it?

1192
01:29:59,227 --> 01:30:00,352
Come on!

1193
01:30:01,313 --> 01:30:03,481
Where are we going?
When's my birthday?

1194
01:30:48,568 --> 01:30:51,821
Some G.I. Joe gave a geezer a heart attack 
at the golf course...

1195
01:30:52,030 --> 01:30:54,740
and accosted a family
right next door.

1196
01:30:54,908 --> 01:30:55,908
A G.I. Joe?

1197
01:30:56,118 --> 01:31:00,496
He's wearing the kind of jacket
you find in an Army-Navy store.

1198
01:31:01,623 --> 01:31:05,209
- I found her! Trevino, Elizabeth.
- Don't tell me.

1199
01:31:06,086 --> 01:31:07,086
Venice.

1200
01:31:08,713 --> 01:31:09,713
How'd you know?

1201
01:31:09,923 --> 01:31:12,341
Where else would an Italian move to?

1202
01:31:12,592 --> 01:31:15,511
<i>Look what I got.</i>

1203
01:31:16,888 --> 01:31:22,017
<i>We got a puppy.
We got a puppy.</i>

1204
01:31:23,937 --> 01:31:27,231
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1205
01:31:28,108 --> 01:31:31,443
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1206
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:47,960
<i>Hi, puppy!</i>

1207
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,641
No answer at the ex-wife.

1208
01:32:02,893 --> 01:32:05,769
- You send the cavalry?
- No, Pacific Division are pricks.

1209
01:32:05,979 --> 01:32:09,773
They can't send units to the same address 
three times in a day...

1210
01:32:09,941 --> 01:32:11,692
to comfort some hysterical woman.

1211
01:32:11,902 --> 01:32:14,320
- What do you want to do?
- Go to Venice.

1212
01:32:16,865 --> 01:32:17,865
Prendergast here.

1213
01:32:18,116 --> 01:32:19,200
Who the fuck is this?

1214
01:32:19,826 --> 01:32:21,702
Shit. It's your wife.

1215
01:32:21,953 --> 01:32:23,329
Oh, boy. Hon?

1216
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:26,290
Yeah, "hon." 
I know who that was!

1217
01:32:26,499 --> 01:32:28,959
Mr. Peepers just scratched
the shit out of me...

1218
01:32:29,211 --> 01:32:31,295
and I'm bleeding like a stuck pig.

1219
01:32:31,922 --> 01:32:33,714
Something important's come up.

1220
01:32:34,216 --> 01:32:36,091
What am I? Dog vomit?

1221
01:32:36,301 --> 01:32:38,344
Your wife says she's bleeding to death...

1222
01:32:38,553 --> 01:32:40,888
and you say something important 
has come up?

1223
01:32:42,015 --> 01:32:44,433
<i>- When are you coming home?</i>
- I don't know.

1224
01:32:45,477 --> 01:32:48,145
Don't tell me you don't know.

1225
01:32:48,355 --> 01:32:51,732
I want to know when the hell
you're coming home, now!

1226
01:32:51,983 --> 01:32:54,318
Amanda, shut up!

1227
01:32:54,653 --> 01:32:56,320
<i>Did you hear me?
Shut up!</i>

1228
01:32:57,989 --> 01:33:01,617
I'll get home when I'm finished,
not a second before. Is that clear?

1229
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:03,827
Is that clear?

1230
01:33:06,081 --> 01:33:08,749
You don't have to bite my head off.

1231
01:33:09,876 --> 01:33:14,171
And you have dinner ready
and waiting for me, okay?

1232
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:18,842
And leave the skin on the chicken.
All right?

1233
01:33:22,055 --> 01:33:23,097
Goodbye.

1234
01:33:28,144 --> 01:33:29,395
Shit!

1235
01:33:30,146 --> 01:33:31,188
Let's go!

1236
01:33:31,648 --> 01:33:33,732
Surprise!

1237
01:33:36,778 --> 01:33:38,779
I'm sorry, Prendergast!

1238
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:44,159
We tried and tried, but could not fit 
your fucking name on the cake!

1239
01:33:46,913 --> 01:33:48,872
Congratulations.
You made it out alive!

1240
01:33:49,207 --> 01:33:52,876
- Listen, listen.
- All right, hold it, hold it.

1241
01:33:53,211 --> 01:33:56,505
Ladies and gentlemen,
the moment you've been waiting for.

1242
01:33:56,756 --> 01:34:01,093
This afternoon's entertainment,
Miss Suzie!

1243
01:34:08,893 --> 01:34:10,019
Suzie Q!

1244
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:12,563
Do your thing!

1245
01:34:13,189 --> 01:34:15,733
Is this the retiring boy?

1246
01:34:16,026 --> 01:34:17,985
Wait, wait!
This is great, guys.

1247
01:34:18,194 --> 01:34:22,990
This is great.
I appreciate it, but I can't stay.

1248
01:34:23,491 --> 01:34:26,827
Jesus! What's your problem?
You afraid of women too?

1249
01:34:27,037 --> 01:34:29,663
I don't blame him.
You ever met his wife?

1250
01:34:31,041 --> 01:34:32,041
What did you say?

1251
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:33,834
- What?
- What did you say?

1252
01:34:34,044 --> 01:34:37,588
- Nothing.
- We don't have time for this.

1253
01:34:39,299 --> 01:34:40,716
You're right.

1254
01:34:46,556 --> 01:34:47,723
<i>Ready, honey?</i>

1255
01:34:52,479 --> 01:34:56,440
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1256
01:34:57,275 --> 01:34:59,068
<i>Happy birthday...</i>

1257
01:34:59,361 --> 01:35:01,362
<i>to you</i>

1258
01:35:02,739 --> 01:35:03,822
<i>No cake for you?</i>

1259
01:35:04,074 --> 01:35:06,367
<i>If she doesn't want it,
don't force her.</i>

1260
01:35:06,618 --> 01:35:08,452
<i>Okay, you can have the teddy.</i>

1261
01:35:08,703 --> 01:35:10,454
<i>Time to go horsy!</i>

1262
01:35:11,873 --> 01:35:14,291
<i>Oh, It's okay. Horsy!
It's okay.</i>

1263
01:35:15,001 --> 01:35:17,628
<i>Giddyap, giddyap.</i>

1264
01:35:22,592 --> 01:35:25,969
<i>- She doesn't want to.
- Just put her on the horse!</i>

1265
01:35:26,596 --> 01:35:28,972
<i>There we go! Horsy ride.</i>

1266
01:35:30,266 --> 01:35:31,350
<i>She doesn't want to.</i>

1267
01:35:31,601 --> 01:35:35,104
<i>- Put her on the horse!
- You can't force her like that.</i>

1268
01:35:35,355 --> 01:35:37,689
<i>I bought her the goddamn horse.</i>

1269
01:35:37,982 --> 01:35:40,150
<i>Here we go! Horsy ride.</i>

1270
01:35:40,402 --> 01:35:43,487
<i>You're scaring her.
I want you to stop this.</i>

1271
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:50,494
<i>Come on, honey.
It's your birthday. It's the pier.</i>

1272
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:54,123
<i>It's your favorite place.
You love the pier.</i>

1273
01:35:57,293 --> 01:35:58,710
<i>Why do you do this?</i>

1274
01:36:25,947 --> 01:36:27,406
Take the back.

1275
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:01,440
You okay?

1276
01:37:01,691 --> 01:37:04,193
- I'm all right.
- Somebody get an ambulance.

1277
01:37:04,611 --> 01:37:08,071
Get an ambulance! Call 911!
Get an ambulance!

1278
01:37:08,364 --> 01:37:12,868
Tell them an officer's been shot!
Go, go, go! Get an ambulance!

1279
01:37:15,288 --> 01:37:16,288
Be careful.

1280
01:37:18,458 --> 01:37:19,917
Go get the bastard!

1281
01:37:20,251 --> 01:37:22,085
He's still dressed like G.I. Joe!

1282
01:38:16,474 --> 01:38:18,725
Daddy! Mommy, look.
Daddy!

1283
01:38:36,744 --> 01:38:40,247
Hi, honey.
I thought I'd find you here.

1284
01:38:42,792 --> 01:38:44,001
Leave us alone!

1285
01:38:45,503 --> 01:38:47,671
What? I can't talk to my wife?

1286
01:38:48,381 --> 01:38:49,756
I'm not your wife anymore.

1287
01:38:50,091 --> 01:38:54,219
No? Sugar, does this ring a bell?
"Till death do us part"?

1288
01:38:54,721 --> 01:38:56,471
Do you remember that?

1289
01:39:03,271 --> 01:39:04,271
I'm sorry.

1290
01:39:04,689 --> 01:39:06,189
Sorry, sorry.

1291
01:39:06,441 --> 01:39:07,441
What are you doing?

1292
01:39:07,692 --> 01:39:10,319
I'm coming home 
from a hard day at the office.

1293
01:39:10,570 --> 01:39:12,988
God bless the working stiffs!

1294
01:39:20,079 --> 01:39:22,331
Please leave her alone!

1295
01:39:29,339 --> 01:39:30,339
Adele?

1296
01:39:33,217 --> 01:39:34,885
You're so big!

1297
01:39:36,721 --> 01:39:38,221
How'd you get so big?

1298
01:39:41,434 --> 01:39:42,851
I missed it.

1299
01:39:43,853 --> 01:39:45,937
They stole it from me, honey.

1300
01:39:46,939 --> 01:39:49,733
Don't you worry. 
They're not gonna take it anymore.

1301
01:39:54,989 --> 01:39:56,823
Bill, listen, please.

1302
01:39:59,243 --> 01:40:01,578
You've got to stop this.

1303
01:40:05,416 --> 01:40:07,000
You need help.

1304
01:40:08,628 --> 01:40:09,753
You're sick.

1305
01:40:10,588 --> 01:40:11,630
Sick?

1306
01:40:12,757 --> 01:40:14,383
You wanna see sick?

1307
01:40:14,592 --> 01:40:16,885
Take a walk around this town.
That's sick.

1308
01:40:17,095 --> 01:40:18,303
You ain't kidding.

1309
01:40:22,266 --> 01:40:25,143
Would you believe it
that I used to fish right here?

1310
01:40:27,814 --> 01:40:29,773
This very spot?

1311
01:40:30,274 --> 01:40:33,068
Now they tell you,
"Don't eat the fish. It's poisonous."

1312
01:40:34,612 --> 01:40:36,905
You can't even swim in the water.

1313
01:40:37,281 --> 01:40:40,158
It'll give you some kind 
of bacterial infection.

1314
01:40:41,703 --> 01:40:43,495
How's that for sick?

1315
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:46,998
I'm having a private moment with my family. 
Leave us alone.

1316
01:40:47,458 --> 01:40:49,334
I'm leaving soon.

1317
01:40:50,461 --> 01:40:53,171
I'm retiring to Arizona.
Lake Havasu City.

1318
01:40:53,881 --> 01:40:54,923
You been there?

1319
01:40:55,174 --> 01:40:56,842
That's not what I mean!

1320
01:40:58,803 --> 01:41:02,848
They call it a lake, but it's really
just a big bowl of muddy water.

1321
01:41:03,057 --> 01:41:05,600
But the wife thinks it's paradise.

1322
01:41:06,394 --> 01:41:09,354
Everybody has their own idea
of what paradise is.

1323
01:41:12,817 --> 01:41:13,900
Take me, for instance.

1324
01:41:16,612 --> 01:41:18,739
You know what I thought paradise was?

1325
01:41:18,948 --> 01:41:21,450
- What?
- If you'll excuse me.

1326
01:41:22,994 --> 01:41:24,202
Making babies.

1327
01:41:25,246 --> 01:41:28,331
Ain't that a kick?
Making babies.

1328
01:41:29,751 --> 01:41:31,460
This your little girl?

1329
01:41:32,336 --> 01:41:33,754
Beautiful.

1330
01:41:35,715 --> 01:41:36,923
She's special.

1331
01:41:41,721 --> 01:41:44,848
You know, my wife never was
cut out for motherhood.

1332
01:41:45,475 --> 01:41:46,558
She did it all for me.

1333
01:41:46,851 --> 01:41:49,603
Went through all that pain,
lost her figure, for me.

1334
01:41:50,688 --> 01:41:53,565
Then the kid went to sleep one night, 
never woke up.

1335
01:41:54,776 --> 01:41:57,110
They called it "Infant Death...

1336
01:41:58,446 --> 01:42:00,030
Syndrome."

1337
01:42:01,157 --> 01:42:03,867
But she wasn't an infant.
She was 2 years old.

1338
01:42:04,035 --> 01:42:05,869
She was a big girl.

1339
01:42:07,538 --> 01:42:09,206
She was our baby.

1340
01:42:12,293 --> 01:42:15,170
Here, darling, this is for you.
Here you go.

1341
01:42:21,761 --> 01:42:23,595
What can you do?

1342
01:42:24,889 --> 01:42:27,766
If she'd been hit by a drunk driver....

1343
01:42:28,059 --> 01:42:30,685
But who do you blame
when they just don't wake up?

1344
01:42:31,395 --> 01:42:32,395
Thank you, sweetheart.

1345
01:42:36,734 --> 01:42:38,068
There's a guy with a gun!

1346
01:42:42,281 --> 01:42:44,032
No! Don't!

1347
01:42:45,910 --> 01:42:46,910
Elizabeth, no!

1348
01:42:47,662 --> 01:42:50,288
Freeze!
You're under arrest.

1349
01:42:50,498 --> 01:42:51,540
Get out of here!

1350
01:42:51,749 --> 01:42:54,042
- Elizabeth! 
- Freeze!

1351
01:42:57,338 --> 01:42:59,714
- What were you gonna do?
- I don't know!

1352
01:42:59,924 --> 01:43:02,092
Guys like you always say that!

1353
01:43:02,343 --> 01:43:06,721
You know exactly what you were gonna do. 
Kill your wife and child!

1354
01:43:08,182 --> 01:43:12,727
Then it'd be too late to turn back.
It'd be easy to kill yourself.

1355
01:43:13,229 --> 01:43:16,815
Let's go meet some nice policemen.
They're good guys. Let's go.

1356
01:43:18,234 --> 01:43:20,569
- I'm the bad guy?
- Yeah.

1357
01:43:25,575 --> 01:43:27,617
How did that happen?

1358
01:43:29,036 --> 01:43:31,580
I did everything they told me to.

1359
01:43:34,792 --> 01:43:36,293
Did you know I build missiles?

1360
01:43:37,211 --> 01:43:39,087
I help to protect America.

1361
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:44,467
You should be rewarded for that.

1362
01:43:44,677 --> 01:43:48,305
Instead, they give it to the plastic surgeon. 
They lied to me.

1363
01:43:50,641 --> 01:43:54,519
Is that what this is about?
You're angry because you got lied to?

1364
01:43:55,021 --> 01:43:57,314
Is that why my dinner's drying out 
in the oven?

1365
01:43:58,107 --> 01:44:01,234
They lie to everybody.
They lie to the fish!

1366
01:44:02,695 --> 01:44:05,614
That doesn't give you any right
to do what you did today.

1367
01:44:06,282 --> 01:44:11,161
The only thing that makes you special
is that little girl. Now, let's go.

1368
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:13,705
Let's go!

1369
01:44:21,047 --> 01:44:22,672
Sure was hot today, wasn't it?

1370
01:44:25,635 --> 01:44:27,510
He has a gun!
The end of the pier!

1371
01:44:27,678 --> 01:44:30,639
Keep this crowd back!
Let's get some backup!

1372
01:44:35,519 --> 01:44:36,895
You know, I got a gun.

1373
01:44:43,277 --> 01:44:44,527
In my pocket.

1374
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:50,325
I got lots of guns.

1375
01:44:50,576 --> 01:44:52,911
Stay there. Don't move.

1376
01:44:53,412 --> 01:44:54,412
You wanna draw?

1377
01:44:55,081 --> 01:44:57,791
Let's not.
Let's call it a day.

1378
01:44:58,042 --> 01:44:59,793
Now, come on.

1379
01:45:00,044 --> 01:45:01,878
It's perfect.

1380
01:45:02,421 --> 01:45:05,924
Showdown between the sheriff
and the bad guy?

1381
01:45:08,052 --> 01:45:09,219
It's beautiful.

1382
01:45:14,266 --> 01:45:15,392
On three.

1383
01:45:15,643 --> 01:45:19,062
This doesn't have to be the end.
You have a choice.

1384
01:45:19,271 --> 01:45:22,607
My little girl is dead.
I don't have a choice. You do!

1385
01:45:23,234 --> 01:45:25,485
No, you have two choices:

1386
01:45:25,945 --> 01:45:27,112
I can kill you.

1387
01:45:28,239 --> 01:45:30,240
Or you can kill me...

1388
01:45:30,658 --> 01:45:33,368
and my little girl
can get the insurance.

1389
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:39,207
- One....
- Don't you wanna see her grow up?

1390
01:45:39,834 --> 01:45:41,710
Behind bars?

1391
01:45:44,964 --> 01:45:47,590
- Two....
- Don't do this. Please.

1392
01:45:49,301 --> 01:45:50,593
- Let's go!
- Three.

1393
01:45:59,729 --> 01:46:01,938
I would have got you.

1394
01:46:41,353 --> 01:46:45,523
What cooperation was there
between Pacific Division and Downtown?

1395
01:46:45,733 --> 01:46:47,859
Not to denigrate the Venice Police...

1396
01:46:48,152 --> 01:46:51,654
but it was one of our fellows
that put this together.

1397
01:46:51,864 --> 01:46:53,281
Prendergast!

1398
01:46:53,949 --> 01:46:57,660
This is Sergeant Prendergast.
Damn fine work, Prendergast.

1399
01:46:57,912 --> 01:47:00,789
Fuck you, Captain Yardley.
Fuck you very much!

1400
01:47:00,998 --> 01:47:03,166
I can't believe--
Did he just say that?

1401
01:47:03,334 --> 01:47:04,751
You're welcome.

1402
01:47:08,964 --> 01:47:11,049
- You still here?
- Afraid so.

1403
01:47:11,258 --> 01:47:14,469
We've stabilized her.
She'll be all right.

1404
01:47:14,678 --> 01:47:16,805
I'll see you at the hospital.

1405
01:47:20,184 --> 01:47:21,810
How are you doing?

1406
01:47:25,231 --> 01:47:26,481
I haven't told her yet.

1407
01:47:28,067 --> 01:47:29,734
Oh, shit!

1408
01:47:30,945 --> 01:47:33,613
It's her birthday.
What should I do?

1409
01:47:34,824 --> 01:47:36,616
Tell her tomorrow.

1410
01:47:37,118 --> 01:47:38,743
Let her have her little party.

1411
01:47:46,418 --> 01:47:48,920
- What's your name, darling?
- Adele.

1412
01:47:49,130 --> 01:47:51,840
Adele?
That's a nice name.

1413
01:47:52,466 --> 01:47:55,552
If I had a little girl,
I'd want her to be named Adele.

1414
01:47:55,761 --> 01:47:58,513
- What's yours?
- Mine?

1415
01:48:00,391 --> 01:48:02,267
My name is mud.

1416
01:48:04,562 --> 01:48:06,229
Your name is not mud.

1417
01:48:06,397 --> 01:48:09,357
It will be when my wife
finds out that...

1418
01:48:09,567 --> 01:48:11,442
I'm still a cop.

1419
01:48:16,657 --> 01:48:17,907
Excuse me.

1420
01:48:22,037 --> 01:48:23,955
Sergeant just signed us out.

1421
01:48:24,165 --> 01:48:26,833
- All right, let's eat.
- Where you wanna go?

1422
01:48:27,585 --> 01:48:30,461
Let's go around the corner
and get one of those....

1423
01:48:35,801 --> 01:48:38,761
<i>Look what I got!</i>

1424
01:48:42,266 --> 01:48:44,559
<i>Just call him, 
"Hi, Puppy."</i>

1425
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:46,561
<i>Hi, Puppy.</i>

1426
01:48:47,897 --> 01:48:49,439
<i>Hi, Puppy.</i>

1427
01:48:54,612 --> 01:48:57,780
<i>There we are!
We got everybody there.</i>

1428
01:48:58,574 --> 01:49:00,450
<i>We got everybody--</i>
