1
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,713
This "pestilent dust"
has appeared only three times.

2
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:38,399
It was found to be limestone...
Messy, but innocuous.

3
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,952
- lnnocuous?
- Harmless.

4
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,317
I know what it means. May l?

5
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,438
Your Honour...

6
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,311
Imagine how
the neighbourhood children feel.

7
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,837
The pounding of construction
ringing in their ears.

8
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,630
This skyscraper, a tribute
to mankind's greed, grows daily.

9
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:11,193
It casts a shadow over their lives
and surrounds them with toxic dust.

10
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,838
Kendall Construction is rebuilding
this neighbourhood.

11
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,473
Granting a restraining order here
will throw 753 people out of work.

12
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,839
You cannot validate this groundless
example of rapacious litigation.

13
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,393
- It is a threat to our society.
- Let's not go off the deep end.

14
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,519
You have made
a compelling case, Mr. Miller.

15
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,911
- But there is no irreparable harm.
- Not yet.

16
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:06,394
- Is that you?
- Yeah, it's me.

17
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,633
- A client of yours?
- Funny!

18
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,713
Excuse me, sir...

19
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,550
I went to a restaurant the other day
and ordered coffee.

20
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,840
The waiter asked, "Would you
like sugar or Sweet & Low?"

21
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,551
I said, "Do I look like
I should be on a diet?"

22
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,117
- Andy.
- Hi, Doc.

23
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:05,274
Your blood work came back.
When I return, we'll discuss it.

24
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,512
I'll be right here.

25
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,271
- Hi, how are you feeling?
- Pretty good.

26
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,353
Make a fist for me.

27
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,958
We're gonna have to start
looking for veins in your feet.

28
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,518
- Terrific job on the Kendall case.
- Thanks, Kenneth.

29
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,356
Anthea, just the paralegal
extraordinaire I was hoping to see.

30
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,638
- The answer is no.
- Dinner at Felicia's...

31
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,475
- I've got a class.
- My briefs need proofing.

32
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,519
Exploit somebody else.
Since you've asked...

33
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,389
- Your exam!
- 98.

34
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,791
98! Congratulations!

35
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:25,671
- Let's talk about the Hansen case.
- Yeah. Thank Amy for the painting.

36
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:32,598
Here are the numbers. The copy's
on your desk. Do you need me?

37
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,991
No. It's 6:30. Go home.

38
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,915
Hello? Hi, darling.
What a surprise. How are you?

39
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,993
- Good.
- What does Dr. Gillman say?

40
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:52,871
She says I am fine.
My blood work is excellent.

41
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:59,036
- How about my platelets?
- Even my platelets look good.

42
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,751
Mom, more importantly,
how are you?

43
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,550
- I'm fine. Your dad is fine.
- What are you doing?

44
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:48,400
- Andy, am I interrupting you?
- In a word, Bob.

45
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,633
Charles wants to see you upstairs.

46
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,511
I was just about to take a break.
You're sure I'm not underdressed?

47
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:05,233
Andy has expressed a keen interest
in Highline versus Sander Systems.

48
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:12,112
- The participants interest me.
- It's an anti-trust action.

49
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:21,234
Is it? Sander Systems copies
Highline's spreadsheet program.

50
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:27,999
For me, the legal principle involved
is copyright infringement.

51
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:35,152
Tell me this, Andy. Which side would
you like to see emerge victorious?

52
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:42,158
Don't be influenced by my friendship
with Sander's CEO Bill Wright.

53
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,637
- I'd like to see Highline win.
- Why, Beckett?

54
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:57,668
If Sander Systems wins, an energetic
young company is destroyed.

55
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:05,315
Copyright laws were enacted to stop
exactly what Sander are doing.

56
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,314
- You know who reps Highline.
- Rodney Bailey.

57
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:17,874
He couldn't find his way around
copyright law with a map.

58
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,276
Apparently the fellas
at Highline agree with you.

59
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:29,434
Therefore, as of 9:03 this evening,
right after the dessert course, -

60
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,038
- they're now represented by Wyant,
Wheeler, Hellerman, Tetlow & Brown.

61
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,351
Outstanding!

62
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:44,117
And more specifically,
senior associate Andrew Beckett.

63
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,233
- Thank you, Robert.
- Start on Highline right away.

64
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,837
- I'm right on it.
- We have to file within ten days.

65
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,118
- Tokyo on line four, Bob.
- Walter, thank you.

66
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,479
- Thank you, Kenneth.
- Congratulations.

67
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,918
- What's that on your forehead?
- Where?

68
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,958
That, right there on your forehead.

69
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:27,638
I got whacked
with a racquet ball... Excuse me.

70
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:38,635
Charles... I sincerely appreciate
your faith in my abilities.

71
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,590
Faith is a belief in something
for which we have no evidence.

72
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,355
It does not apply in this situation.

73
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,115
Go home.
No... go back to work!

74
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:08,229
- Thank you, Charles.
- No sweat, buddy.

75
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,475
Tommy, how are you?

76
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:12,030
The complaint is on my desk, Shelby.
Tell Jamey to get on top of it.

77
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,236
Anything else?

78
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:20,270
No, I'll be working out of the house
for the rest of the afternoon.

79
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,079
Bye.

80
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:28,758
You want to apply the foundation
as evenly as you can.

81
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:35,678
It shouldn't look like
you threw it on with a spoon.

82
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,674
You don't think this
is a little too orange for me?

83
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,958
It's Tahitian Bronze.
That works best on these lesions.

84
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:50,514
- Say you've been to Aruba.
- I've called in sick for four days.

85
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,592
Now they'll think I was on a cruise.

86
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,877
- Fax.
- Thank you, Bruno.

87
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,077
We could try this Light Egypt...

88
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,994
- What?
- Andy?

89
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,316
Excuse me.

90
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,278
Just like my cousin Fredo.

91
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,599
Hi... Does anybody want a bagel?

92
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,236
Are you okay, Andy?

93
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,756
I need to go to the hospital.

94
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:23,039
- It's all right.
- I'm getting out of here.

95
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,830
- One more.
- Thank you for driving me here.

96
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,676
I told Dr. Gillman to take a day off
and she took a day off!

97
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:39,359
- Did they take a specimen?
- Blood... I'm empty.

98
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,118
You have a fever, baby.

99
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:50,070
- This is my guy. Excuse me...
- Just one second.

100
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:57,390
I ran to the bathroom. I almost
lost it in front of everybody.

101
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,712
- It's nothing to be ashamed of.
- It's just...

102
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:07,830
- Any news on my blood work?
- No. We'll do a colonoscopy.

103
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,034
- It sounds delightful.
- Wait. Why do that?

104
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,397
- Who are you?
- Who are you, Doctor...

105
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,677
This is my partner.

106
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:28,868
- He records all my hospital visits.
- I'm Dr. Klenstein.

107
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:35,912
A colonoscopy will show us if it's
the K.S. causing the diarrhoea.

108
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:41,950
- It could be an infection...
- A reaction to AZT.

109
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,839
That's possible...

110
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,232
He's not having this
until we cancel out everything else.

111
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,916
I'm trying to help your partner.
You're not a member of his family.

112
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,915
- I could have you removed.
- He's upset. He's sorry.

113
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:04,200
- No, don't apologize for me.
- Okay, he's not sorry.

114
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:10,799
Let's see what the blood work
tells us. I'll give a specimen.

115
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:15,875
Maybe we'll hear from Dr. Gillman.
Everybody happy?

116
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,635
- I'll check on the blood work.
- Sorry...

117
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:28,910
- That's the third time.
- Dr. Klenstein...

118
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,914
I have to call the office.
I want you to relax.

119
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:38,313
- I am relaxed.
- Good. Is there a phone around?

120
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:47,068
If you have been injured, you may
be entitled to a cash settlement...

121
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,391
Good Lord!

122
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:50,720
- Mr. Beckett's office.
- Shelby, it's me.

123
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,076
- Mr. Beckett's office.
- Shelby, it's me.

124
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,596
- Jamey beeped me.
- I'm glad you called.

125
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:04,472
It's about the Highline complaint.
Jamey is going ballistic!

126
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,714
- Calm down. Put him on.
- One second.

127
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:14,829
- Where's the Highline complaint?
- Wait! Slow down.

128
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,039
It was supposed to be here
this morning.

129
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:26,675
I left it in my office last night.
I put the corrected copy on my desk.

130
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:32,392
- I'm telling you, it's not here.
- All right, try my hard disk.

131
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,519
You'll have
to print it out yourself.

132
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,831
- What did you file it under?
- HL1.

133
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,879
You know that there's
a statute of limitations on this.

134
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,918
It runs out...

135
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,514
... in 75 minutes.

136
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:57,238
- It's not here. Andy.
- It's not there? I'm on my way!

137
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:05,109
Every problem has a solution.

138
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,876
Push, baby.

139
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,273
It's a girl!

140
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,551
- Take a picture, Joe.
- I can't get the film in there.

141
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,429
Help me, baby.

142
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,191
Look at her. A sweet little...

143
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,959
She's perfect.

144
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,797
Go down to the deli.
Get a pound of Scotch salmon.

145
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,635
Rolls, bagels...
Give me a call.

146
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,315
- And some champagne.
- You're that TV guy.

147
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,040
Dom Perignon.

148
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,273
$100? No, get a nice Californian.

149
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:11,037
Get it over here, she's starving.
No, not the baby... Lisa!

150
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:17,196
- lris... anybody call?
- Yes, an Andrew Beckett.

151
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,797
- Who's Andrew Beckett?
- Hey, Joseph!

152
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,278
Explain it like I'm a six-year-old.

153
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,514
The entire street is clear except
for a large hole under construction.

154
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,717
It's marked and blocked off.

155
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,078
You decide to cross the street
and fall down the hole.

156
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,756
- Now you want to sue the city.
- Yes. Do I have a case?

157
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,708
- Yeah, of course you do.
- Great.

158
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:24,874
Go with my assistant lris.
Sort out the fee arrangement.

159
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,350
We take no cash
unless we get justice.

160
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,638
- How's your back? Any pain?
- Now that you mention it...

161
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:40,036
- lris, take good care of him.
- I will. Mr. Beckett's here.

162
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,794
Mr. Beckett.

163
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,914
Come in.

164
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,120
Good to see you again, counsellor.
Judge Tate. Kendall Construction.

165
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,670
"lnnocuous!"

166
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:06,631
- What happened to your face?
- I have AlDS.

167
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,190
I'm sorry.

168
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,990
- Can I sit down?
- Yeah.

169
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:31,799
Look at this...
you have a new baby.

170
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,356
Yeah, a little baby girl.

171
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:46,636
- "It's a girl." Congratulations.
- Yeah, one week old.

172
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:53,114
- Kids are great.
- Yeah, I'm real excited about it.

173
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:02,793
- What can I do for you?
- I've been fired by Wyant Wheeler.

174
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,919
I want to sue them
for wrongful termination.

175
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,834
You want to sue Wyant, Wheeler,
Hellerman, Tetlow & Brown?

176
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,552
- Yes. I'm seeking representation.
- Continue.

177
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,631
I misplaced an important complaint.
That's their story.

178
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,315
Do you want to hear mine?

179
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:32,795
- Have you been to other lawyers?
- Yes, nine.

180
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,709
Continue.

181
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:42,318
The night before it was due, I left
a copy of the complaint on my desk.

182
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:49,909
The next day the complaint vanished.
No hard copy.

183
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,358
All traces of it mysteriously gone
from my computer.

184
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:02,715
Miraculously, a copy was found
just in time to get it to court.

185
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:09,115
But the next day I was summoned
to a meeting with the partners.

186
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:14,638
Hel lo, Andy. Come on in.
Hit the windows.

187
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,836
- Thanks. Come on in.
- Hel lo, everybody.

188
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,390
Thanks for coming in.

189
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:32,511
Before we begin, I'd like to say
that everyone here is your friend.

190
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:38,357
- I know that, Charles.
- More than your friend. Family.

191
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:46,034
Charles... I must apologize again
for the Highline mishap yesterday.

192
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,875
That was some scary moment
around here.

193
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:54,238
Thank God that no damage was done.

194
00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:02,114
- This time. What about next time?
- There won't be a next time.

195
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:08,392
Something's come over you lately.
I don't know...

196
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:14,635
- A kind of stupor or fogginess.
- You have an attitude problem.

197
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,109
Really?

198
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:23,398
- Who thinks that?
- I do.

199
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:31,077
Excuse me...
Am I being fired?

200
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:37,679
Let me put it this way: Your place
at this firm is no longer secure.

201
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:44,439
It isn't fair to keep you here
when your prospects are limited.

202
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:51,591
- I don't want to rush you...
- We've got a committee meeting.

203
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:57,517
This is preposterous.
It doesn't make any sense.

204
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,639
- You do have an attitude problem.
- Take it easy.

205
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,792
Why did you ever give me Highline?

206
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:11,718
You nearly blew the entire case.
It could have been a catastrophe.

207
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,233
You concealed your illness.

208
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,071
That's correct.

209
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:33,632
Explain it like I'm a two-year-old.
I can't seem to grasp this.

210
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:39,272
Weren't you obliged to tell
your employer you had AlDS?

211
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,113
That's not the point.

212
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:46,956
I always served my clients
with absolute excellence.

213
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,635
If they hadn't fired me,
I'd still do that.

214
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,190
They couldn't fire you
for being sick, -

215
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,035
- so they tried
to make you look imcompetent.

216
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,033
Correct. I was sabotaged.

217
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,752
I don't buy it, counsellor.

218
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:13,709
- That's very disappointing.
- I don't see a case.

219
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,397
I have a case.

220
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:24,270
- If you don't want it...
- That's correct. I don't.

221
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,195
Thank you for your time.

222
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,073
Mr. Beckett...

223
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,389
I'm sorry about what happened.
It's a bitch.

224
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,838
- Have a nice day, Mr. Beckett.
- What's the matter with that guy?

225
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,719
Iris, get me Armbruster.

226
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,919
I want to see Armbruster
sometime this afternoon.

227
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,040
Right away, lris.

228
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,119
Right away, lris.

229
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:48,237
HlV-virus can only be transmitted
by the exchange of bodily fluids.

230
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,871
Blood, semen,
and vaginal secretions.

231
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:57,830
But they're finding out new things
about this disease every day.

232
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,595
Today you tell me there's no danger.

233
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,753
But six months from now
you may know different.

234
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:10,277
Maybe you can carry it
on your shirt or your clothes.

235
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,200
What are you doing?

236
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:18,148
- We're gonna draw blood.
- Why?

237
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:27,228
Joe, I've known you a long time.
Your private life is your business.

238
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:35,111
I don't need an AlDS test.
Just send the bill to my office.

239
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,636
Thanks for the information.

240
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,309
- You have a problem with gays.
- Not especially.

241
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,870
- Do you know any gays?
- Do you?

242
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,190
- Yes.
- Who?

243
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,352
Karen Berman. My Aunt Teresa.

244
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:01,469
Cousin Tommy in Rochester.
Eddie Meyers from the office.

245
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:06,714
- Stanley, who fixed the kitchen.
- Aunt Teresa is gay?

246
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,998
That beautiful, voluptuous woman
is a lesbian?

247
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:16,792
- Since when?
- Probably since she was born.

248
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,592
I admit it, okay. I'm prejudiced.
I don't like homosexuals.

249
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:26,878
The way they do that thing.
Don't they get confused?

250
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,918
"ls this yours or mine?"

251
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:35,752
I don't want to be in bed with
anybody who is stronger than me.

252
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:41,278
You can call me old-fashioned
and conservative, but I'm a man.

253
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:48,915
Any man will tell you
how disgusting that whole idea is.

254
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:54,234
- Little cave man of the house.
- You damn skippy.

255
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,791
- Stay away from your Aunt Teresa.
- Don't say that to her.

256
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:05,229
Guys trying to be macho
and faggot at the same time.

257
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:09,791
- I'm being totally honest with you.
- Yeah, you are.

258
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:15,830
Would you accept a client
if you were constantly thinking:

259
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,438
"l don't want this person
to touch me or even breathe on me?"

260
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:27,035
- Not if I was you, honey.
- Exactly... What?

261
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,717
Merry Christmas.

262
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,678
- Thank you.
- Happy New Year.

263
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,077
- You're the...
- TV guy.

264
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,677
This is the supplement.

265
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,868
You're right. There is a section
on HlV-related discrimination.

266
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:51,352
Thank you very much.

267
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,110
We do have
a private research room.

268
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:09,116
- I'm fine right here.
- I'm looking for the Murdoch case.

269
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,033
Just a moment.

270
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:35,358
Wouldn't you be more comfortable
in a research room?

271
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,993
No...
would it make you more comfortable?

272
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,830
Beckett, how are you doing?

273
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,070
Counsellor.

274
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,997
Whatever, sir.

275
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,232
Excuse me.

276
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:46,234
Who did you get?
Did you find a lawyer?

277
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,831
I'm a lawyer.

278
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:57,310
- How's your baby?
- She's... wonderful.

279
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,229
- What's her name?
- Larice.

280
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:06,790
- That's a beautiful name.
- We named her after my sister.

281
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,792
Look...

282
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,392
How did they find out you had AlDS?

283
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,678
One of the partners
noticed a lesion on my forehead.

284
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,275
But how..?

285
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:11,117
How do you go from that,
which could have been anything, -

286
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:18,436
- to deducing that you had AlDS
and terminating you on that basis?

287
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,755
That's a good point.

288
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,316
The partner who spotted the lesion,
Walter Kenton, -

289
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:37,439
- worked for Walsh, Ulmer & Brahm
in D.C.

290
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:43,436
A paralegal there, Melissa Benedict,
showed lesions on and off.

291
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:47,275
It was common knowledge
that she had AlDS.

292
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,309
- But they didn't fire her.
- No, they did not fire her.

293
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,916
Have you got a relevant precedent?

294
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:02,599
The Arline decision...
Supreme Court.

295
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,789
"The Federal Rehabilitation Act
of 1973, -

296
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:26,112
- prohibits discrimination
against handicapped persons -

297
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:30,319
- if they can perform the duties
required of them."

298
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,598
"Though the ruling did not specify
AlDS discrimination..."

299
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:39,276
"... subsequent decisions have held
that AlDS is a handicap -

300
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,955
- because of the physical
limitations it imposes -

301
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:48,513
- and the prejudice surrounding it,
which exacts a social death...

302
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:57,153
... that proceeds
the actual physical one."

303
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,512
"This is the essence
of discrimination."

304
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,196
"Formulating opinions about others
not based on their merits, -

305
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:17,309
- but on their membership in a group
with the same characteristics."

306
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,715
- Charles Wheeler.
- Julius Erving. Glad to see you.

307
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,156
Ken Starr.

308
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,517
It'll only take a minute.

309
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,954
Charles Wheeler. How are you doing?
A summons for you.

310
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:08,318
Take a look at it.
Dr. J., you're the best.

311
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,156
If you ever need a lawyer,
just give me a call.

312
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,198
See you in court.

313
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,033
You're the TV guy.

314
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,191
What's up?

315
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:29,831
I want to know everything
about Andy's personal life.

316
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,436
Does he frequent
those pathetic bars?

317
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:37,752
What other homosexual facilities
does he go to?

318
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,596
What deviant groups
does he secretly belong to?

319
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:48,676
- What is it, Bob?
- Let's make a settlement offer.

320
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:55,752
Andy brought AlDS into our offices,
into our men's room.

321
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,232
He brought AlDS
to our annual family picnic!

322
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,313
- We ought to be suing him.
- Show some compassion.

323
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,040
We gave him Highline.

324
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:13,196
Did Beckett say, "l won't be able to
function to the best of my ability?"

325
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:17,194
Now, discarding the trust
I conferred upon him, -

326
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:21,433
- Andrew Beckett proposes
to haul me into court.

327
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,275
To sling accusations at me.
To call me a bigot...

328
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:31,117
... in full view of the Philadelphia
judicial establishment.

329
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,870
Beckett doesn't want to go to court.

330
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:45,955
- A jury might side with him.
- Wait a minute...

331
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:50,671
He was fired for incompetence,
not because he has AlDS.

332
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:56,039
- Did you know he was sick?
- Did you, Bob?

333
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,153
No... not really.

334
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,035
Everybody,
this is the house that I grew up in.

335
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,670
Right here in
Lower Merion, Pennsylvania.

336
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,991
Here's proof.

337
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,436
There. My hand prints
from when I was a cute little boy.

338
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:35,913
Today is the 40th wedding
anniversary of my mom and dad.

339
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:42,952
- A tough life in all that poverty.
- Those can be some mean streets.

340
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:48,592
Here's the front door. I once
broke this finger in this door.

341
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,468
- Where's my brother?
- There's my sister Jill.

342
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,997
- Say hello, Alexis.
- Mommy's pregnant again.

343
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,549
Are you really?

344
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,474
- Hello, Meghan.
- Uncle Andy.

345
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,871
- Where's Dad?
- Fixing the snowblower.

346
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,953
It snows once in seven years,
and Dad buys a new snowblower.

347
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:15,635
- How are you?
- Today's a good day.

348
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:22,114
Meghan, you're doing a great job.
I've got to say hello to my sisters.

349
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,993
Put me down!

350
00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:00,512
Parts of the trial
will be hard for you to hear, -

351
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:06,391
- about my personal life.
And there's going to be publicity.

352
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:11,998
- Do you want me to take her?
- No, she's fine.

353
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:18,629
I think it's great you're asking...
but this is really your call.

354
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,519
Thanks, brother.

355
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:26,868
You're my kid brother.
That's all that matters, okay?

356
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,190
To be honest,
I'm worried about Mommy and Daddy.

357
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:38,992
They've been through so much, and
there are some tough times ahead.

358
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:45,596
Andy, the way that you've
handled this whole thing...

359
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,390
... you and Miguel...
with so much courage...

360
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,838
There's nothing
that anybody could say -

361
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,518
- that could make us feel anything
but incredibly proud of you.

362
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,873
I didn't raise my kids
to sit in the back of the bus.

363
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,795
You get in there
and you fight for your rights.

364
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:14,554
I love you guys.

365
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,075
Ladies and gentlemen...

366
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:48,351
Forget everything you've seen
on TV and in the movies.

367
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:53,230
There will be no surprise witnesses
or tearful confessions.

368
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,154
You're going to be presented
with a simple fact.

369
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:01,158
Andrew Beckett was fired.

370
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:05,871
You'll hear two explanations
for why he was fired.

371
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,873
It is up to you
to sift through the facts -

372
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,033
- until you determine
what you think to be the truth.

373
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:21,150
Certain points must be proven.
One: Andrew Beckett was...

374
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:24,756
... is a brilliant lawyer.

375
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:28,549
Two: Andrew Beckett,
has a debilitating disease.

376
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:36,274
He made the legal choice to keep
this fact from his employers.

377
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:43,039
Three: His employer discovered this.
The illness here is AlDS.

378
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,988
Four: They panicked.

379
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,754
They did what most of us
would like to do with AlDS.

380
00:45:54,920 --> 00:46:01,075
Get it and everybody who has it
as far away from us as possible.

381
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:07,960
Such behaviour may seem reasonable
to you. It does to me.

382
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:11,112
AlDS is an incurable disease.

383
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:18,118
But no matter what moral judgement
you make upon his employers, -

384
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:23,513
- the fact that Beckett was fired
because he had AlDS...

385
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,673
... means they broke the law.

386
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,719
Fact:

387
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:43,159
Andrew Beckett's performance
on the job varied from competent...

388
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:47,313
... to, often times, mediocre...

389
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:51,871
... to sometimes
flagrantly incompetent.

390
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,600
Fact:

391
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:59,390
He claims
he's the victim of lies and deceit.

392
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,031
Fact:

393
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:09,038
It was Andrew Beckett who lied
about his disease to his employers.

394
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,351
Fact:

395
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:16,799
He was successful in his duplicity.

396
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,555
The partners at Wyant Wheeler
did not know -

397
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:25,077
- that Andrew Beckett had AlDS
when they fired him.

398
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,316
Fact:

399
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,836
Andrew Beckett is dying.

400
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:45,391
Fact:
Andrew Beckett is angry.

401
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:53,752
His lifestyle and reckless behaviour
have cut short his life.

402
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:59,598
In his anger and rage
he is lashing out.

403
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,511
He wants someone to pay.

404
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,314
Thank you.

405
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:28,112
Andrew Beckett represented
your firm in 1990, is that correct?

406
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:32,319
- That's correct.
- Were you pleased with his work?

407
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:36,678
We were satisfied
with the outcome of the litigation.

408
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:41,431
Satisfied.

409
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:49,317
Mr. Laird, you gave me sworn
testimony in your deposition.

410
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:53,030
- Is that correct?
- Correct.

411
00:48:53,200 --> 00:49:00,595
You said you were impressed
and delighted with Beckett's work.

412
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,399
Do you recall saying that?

413
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:15,873
In all honesty I was delighted
with aspects of Andy's efforts.

414
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:21,910
But in general, I found the work
to be merely satisfactory.

415
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:31,868
Do you agree...

416
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:35,835
... that a baloney sandwich
is a satisfactory meal?

417
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:42,439
Whereas, caviar and champagne,
roast duck and baked Alaska...

418
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,433
... might be considered delightful?

419
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:50,628
We object. These gastronomical
comments are irrelevant.

420
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:56,750
Five months ago you characterised
Andrew Beckett as caviar.

421
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:59,798
Now he's a baloney sandwich.

422
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:05,637
What powerful force
caused this change of mind?

423
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,831
He hasn't changed his mind.
He's amplified his answer.

424
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,719
Objection sustained.

425
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:28,036
Mr. Laird, explain this to me
like I'm a four-year-old.

426
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:31,909
Did Andrew Beckett
win your lawsuit for you?

427
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:38,589
- Yes, we won.
- Congratulations. What a...

428
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,877
... satisfactory experience.

429
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,348
Ready, Mr. Beckett.

430
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,472
Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve!

431
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:24,872
Do you see this
as a gay-rights issue?

432
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,915
I am not political.
I just want what is fair.

433
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,275
You are gay?

434
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,433
That's none of your business,
but yes, I am.

435
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,551
Do homosexuals
deserve special treatment?

436
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,870
Hell no!

437
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:47,874
Philadelphia
is the city of brotherly love.

438
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:51,350
The Declaration of Independence
was signed here.

439
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,590
That document says:

440
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:58,550
"All men are created equal. "

441
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,831
Give me a break.

442
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:10,399
- We scorn discriminatory practices.
- Thank you, Mayor.

443
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:15,680
You're not getting a little light
in the sneakers, are you, pal?

444
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:30,030
Yeah, I am, Filko. I'm changing.

445
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,668
I'm on the prowl.

446
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:37,436
And I'm looking for a hunk.
A real man... Iike you.

447
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:42,148
You know what we do.
You want to play sailor?

448
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:45,511
- Columbus and the first mate.
- That's not funny!

449
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:50,674
These people make me sick...
but the law's been broken.

450
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:54,116
You remember the law, don't you?

451
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:02,399
- At least we agree on one thing.
- What's that?

452
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,995
Tutti-fruttis make me sick, too.

453
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:16,113
Ms. Benedict, you worked
for Walsh, Ulmer & Brahm.

454
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:20,796
- At the same time as Walter Kenton?
- That's correct.

455
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:26,353
He knew the lesions on your face
and arms were caused by AlDS?

456
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:29,592
Definitely, I told all the partners.

457
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,753
How did Walter Kenton
treat you after that?

458
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:38,596
Every time we met,
he'd get this look on his face.

459
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:44,278
The "Oh God!" expression. As in,
"Oh God, that woman has AlDS."

460
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,477
Thank you. No more questions.

461
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:52,674
Ms. Benedict,
how did you contract AlDS?

462
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:56,674
Through a transfusion
just after childbirth.

463
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:02,119
So it was not your behaviour
which caused you to be infected.

464
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:05,397
You were unable to avoid it.

465
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:10,752
I guess.

466
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,471
Thank you.

467
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:21,236
But I don't consider myself
different to anyone else with AlDS.

468
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:26,235
I'm not guilty. I'm not innocent.
I'm just trying to survive.

469
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:31,269
Thank you, Ms. Benedict.
No further questions at this time.

470
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:36,148
You may step down, Ms. Benedict.

471
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:42,836
Apart from the marks on his face,
were there other things -

472
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,788
- that made you suspect he had AlDS?

473
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:52,273
He was thin and he seemed tired,
but he was working so hard.

474
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,829
Something was wrong.

475
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,152
They're trying to pretend
that they didn't notice anything.

476
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:03,472
- Objection.
- Just answer the question.

477
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:08,589
Have you ever felt discriminated
against at Wyant Wheeler?

478
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:12,438
- Yes.
- In what way?

479
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,831
Mr. Wheeler's secretary Lydia -

480
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,278
- said that Mr. Wheeler
had a problem with my earrings.

481
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:26,310
Apparently Mr. Wheeler felt
that they were too "ethnic".

482
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:31,600
She told me he'd like something
a little less garish...

483
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:37,756
- Something more "American".
- What did you say?

484
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:42,596
I said, "My earrings are American.
They're African-American."

485
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:49,873
- Let's have order, please.
- No more questions.

486
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:54,795
Ms. Burton,
weren't you recently promoted?

487
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:59,272
Yes, I'm in charge
of the paralegal department.

488
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,391
Congratulations on your unfettered
success at Wyant Wheeler.

489
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:08,438
Unfettered?

490
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,717
I don't understand this.

491
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:17,955
The promotion of an obviously
intelligent, articulate...

492
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:23,035
... qualified
African-American woman -

493
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:27,398
- in a firm which practices
wanton discrimination.

494
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:32,953
- That is what's claimed here.
- I can't explain it.

495
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:39,389
Could it be that
these instances of discrimination -

496
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:46,079
- are in fact misunderstandings that
have been blown out of proportion?

497
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:51,918
I think counsel tends
to oversimplify the issue.

498
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:57,996
Thank you, Ms. Burton,
I'll take that into consideration.

499
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,915
How's the trial going?

500
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:22,595
I saw you on TV.
I'm a law student at Penn.

501
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:27,038
You saw me on TV?
It's a good school, Penn.

502
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:31,239
I'm in my second year.
I just wanted to tell you -

503
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:36,838
- this case is extremely important.
You're doing a fantastic job.

504
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,753
When you graduate, call me.

505
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:48,198
Thank you very much.
Listen, Joe...

506
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:56,674
- Would you like to get a beer?
- No, my wife is...

507
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:01,635
I don't pick up people
in drug stores every day.

508
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:12,076
- Do you think I'm gay?
- Aren't you?

509
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:17,678
- Do I look gay to you?
- Do I look gay to you?

510
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,516
- Relax.
- I ought to kick your faggoty ass.

511
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,592
Take it as a compliment.

512
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,915
That is exactly the kind of bullshit
that makes people hate your...

513
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,196
... faggoty asses.

514
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:40,310
- You try and kick my ass, asshole.
- No, you're the asshole, buddy!

515
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,070
Continue, Ms. O'Hara.

516
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:55,519
We were going crazy
looking for this complaint.

517
00:58:55,680 --> 00:59:00,800
Mr. Beckett was screaming.
He looked so freaky.

518
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:06,592
Mr. Kenton kept saying,
"You lost the Highline complaint!"

519
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:10,753
All of a sudden,
Jamey comes in with the complaint.

520
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:15,835
- He says "lt was in Central Files!"
- Central Files?

521
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:21,233
That's where files are sent
when cases are closed.

522
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:28,351
Jamey got to the court just in time.
Everybody was completely wasted.

523
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:37,599
Mr. Beckett just kept saying,
"I'm sorry. I don't understand."

524
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,709
Thank you.

525
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,758
No further questions.

526
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,430
Mr. Miller.

527
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:56,232
- May l?
- Certainly.

528
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:07,035
Thank you.

529
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,350
Are you okay?

530
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:13,110
- Do you want a glass of water?
- No.

531
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:21,116
- Was Andy a good boss?
- Yes.

532
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,238
He was very sweet.

533
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:30,633
How would you characterize
his work as an attorney?

534
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:34,594
How would I know?
I just worked for him.

535
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:40,189
Excuse me, Your Honour,
is this for the record?

536
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:45,514
Mr. Miller, perhaps you should
return to counsel's table.

537
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:58,953
Ms. O'Hara...

538
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:02,476
Were you aware of any problems -

539
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:08,272
- that the senior partners had
with Andrew's work prior to this?

540
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:15,237
- No, I wasn't.
- Thank you. No more questions.

541
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:28,278
- Was Mr. Beckett forgetful?
- Not to my knowledge. No.

542
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:33,434
How would you go about
making a lawyer look incompetent?

543
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:37,070
Hiding an important document
for a few hours?

544
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:40,630
Making it look like
the responsible lawyer misplaced it?

545
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:46,352
Would the partners do that
if they found out Andy was sick?

546
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:48,636
Perhaps.

547
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:55,353
We've had lawyers who've had
heart attacks, ulcers, cancer...

548
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:59,798
Did you have something to do with
this file being lost accidentally?

549
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:04,750
- Objection.
- Did you misplace this file?

550
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:09,550
- Absolutely not.
- Are you a homosexual?

551
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:14,236
Answer the question.
Are you a homo? A faggot?

552
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:20,714
You know, a queen? A fairy?
Rump-roaster? Are you gay?

553
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,155
Objection!

554
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:26,517
Counsel's attacking his own witness.

555
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:31,993
Mr. Collin's sexual orientation
has nothing to do with this case.

556
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:35,955
Please have a seat, Ms. Conine.

557
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:42,479
Approach the bench, Mr. Miller.

558
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:57,314
Kindly share with me exactly
what's going on in your head.

559
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:01,553
Because I haven't a clue.

560
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:07,989
Your Honour...

561
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:13,996
Everybody in this room is thinking
about sexual orientation.

562
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:17,232
Sexual preference, whatever.

563
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:21,439
Who does what to whom,
and how they do it.

564
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:24,672
They're thinking
about Andrew Beckett.

565
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:28,549
Mr. Wheeler, Ms. Conine,
even you, Your Honour.

566
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:31,359
They're wondering.

567
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:37,436
I know they're thinking about me.
Let's get it out in the open...

568
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:43,152
... out of the closet.
This case isn't just about AlDS.

569
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:47,518
Let's talk about
what this case is really all about.

570
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:52,959
The general public's loathing,
hatred and fear of homosexuals.

571
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:59,753
And how that hatred translated
into the firing of this homosexual.

572
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:04,072
My client. Andrew Beckett.

573
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:07,869
Please have a seat, Mr. Miller.

574
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,876
Very good.

575
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:20,878
In this court, justice is blind
to matters of race, creed, colour, -

576
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:24,032
- and sexual orientation.

577
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:28,036
With all due respect,
Your Honour...

578
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:32,239
We don't live in this courtroom,
do we?

579
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:39,955
No, but with regard to this witness,
I'll sustain the objection.

580
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:47,239
How many weeks at a time
would you be out to sea?

581
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:50,949
Anywhere from two weeks
to several months.

582
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:57,434
- Any women on board?
- Not when I was in the Navy.

583
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:04,752
During these long voyages,
no women in sight...

584
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:09,072
Hundreds of hard working,
robust young men in their prime...

585
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:15,395
At the peak of their
natural appetites and desires...

586
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:19,235
- Anything going on?
- Like what?

587
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:23,552
Like two sailors down below
making flippy-flop.

588
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:26,314
Objection.

589
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:29,229
There was one.

590
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:32,949
- Objection.
- Continue, Mr. Miller.

591
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:36,999
You mean a homosexual?

592
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:43,030
He strutted around naked
trying to be noticed. It was sick.

593
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:49,036
It was destroying our morale.
We let him know what we thought.

594
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:55,036
- Did you write him a letter?
- We stuck his head in a latrine.

595
01:05:55,200 --> 01:06:01,230
You taught him a lesson. Just like
firing Beckett taught him a lesson.

596
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:07,236
- You knew Ms. Benedict had AlDS?
- She didn't try to conceal it.

597
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:11,632
So you know the difference
between a bruise and a lesion?

598
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,837
Beckett told me
he'd been hit by a ball.

599
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,278
How did hearing of Ms. Benedict's
illness affect you?

600
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:25,072
She said that you were repulsed
by her and avoided her.

601
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:31,236
I feel nothing but the deepest
sympathy for people like Melissa, -

602
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:37,236
- who contracted this disease
through no fault of their own.

603
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,117
Andy, don't move now.

604
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:15,158
It's not going through.

605
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:20,633
We may have to flush it out again.

606
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:27,837
The vein's closed.

607
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,551
- We'd better call Barbara.
- Nurse Ratchett?

608
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:37,794
Tell her to come over.

609
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:47,516
There's so much stuff
I need to get done.

610
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:51,195
Can't we just skip
treatment for tonight?

611
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:55,433
No, we are not skipping
this treatment.

612
01:07:55,600 --> 01:08:01,436
It's my arm and my treatment,
and I say skip it.

613
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:12,793
You know something?

614
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:17,636
- That stuff is saving your life.
- What's the matter with you?

615
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:20,872
- Close the law book.
- Let me...

616
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:36,196
The least you can do
is look at me -

617
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:40,956
- and give me
a little of your time. Got it?

618
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:49,073
You are worried we don't have
very much time left, aren't you?

619
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:51,595
No.

620
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:09,078
I'll tell you what...

621
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:17,557
We'll plan my memorial service
and prepare for the inevitable.

622
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:24,869
Maybe you should think about it.

623
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:44,400
No.

624
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:56,112
No... I've got a better idea.

625
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,470
Hi, Andrew. Hi, Miguel.

626
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:19,953
Joe Miller...
Lisa, nice to meet you!

627
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:25,274
This is Miguel's sister. Maria.

628
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:32,189
- Would you like a drink?
- I'll take care of Joe.

629
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:39,710
- You're looking... alive tonight.
- I had a blood transfusion.

630
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:44,715
Do you like it? I'm a lawsuit.

631
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:49,908
- Not bad. What are you drinking?
- Wine is good.

632
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:53,789
Could I have some of the red?

633
01:10:54,240 --> 01:11:02,272
- I've got some questions for you.
- I'm at a party right now.

634
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:05,113
We'll get to it later.

635
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:08,078
Hi, Joe Miller.

636
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:12,677
- Do I know you?
- Mona Lisa.

637
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:17,152
- Lawsuit.
- Nice. Have fun.

638
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,110
Thank you.

639
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:10,192
- Congratulations, counsellor.
- With what?

640
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:16,310
You survived what I presume to be
your first gay party, intact.

641
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:24,876
When you're brought up
the way most people are, -

642
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:31,149
- there's not a lot of discussion
about homosexuality.

643
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:34,752
As a kid you're taught
that queers are funny.

644
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:41,109
Queers dress up like their mother.
That they're a danger to kids.

645
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:46,798
And that all they want to do
is get into your pants.

646
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:52,273
That pretty much sums up
the general thinking out there.

647
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:58,470
- Thanks for sharing that with me.
- Let's go over this testimony.

648
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:03,392
First, I'll ask you:

649
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:08,714
Can you describe the circumstances
in which you joined Wyant Wheeler?

650
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:11,599
Miller?

651
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:16,393
Do you ever pray?

652
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:22,510
That's not the answer I want.
But, yes, I pray.

653
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:28,710
- What do you pray for?
- I pray that...

654
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:34,830
I pray that my baby is healthy.
I prayed at her delivery.

655
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:40,199
I pray the Phillies win the pennant.
Now can we get to the questions?

656
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:46,879
Can you describe the circumstances
in which you joined Wyant Wheeler?

657
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:53,149
- Can you do that?
- I may miss the end of this trial.

658
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:56,159
Yes, I've considered that.

659
01:14:56,320 --> 01:15:01,952
I've made some provisions in my will
for some charities.

660
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:07,831
- Miguel will need a lawyer.
- I know a good probate.

661
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,276
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

662
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:17,834
Can you describe the circumstances
in which you joined Wyant Wheeler?

663
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:25,358
Do you like opera?

664
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:33,239
I'm not that familiar with opera.

665
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:38,558
This is my favourite aria.

666
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:42,358
This is Maria Callas.

667
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:46,272
This is "Andrea Chenier".

668
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:51,194
Umberto Giordano.

669
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:55,911
This is Madeleine.

670
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:59,672
She's saying how...

671
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:06,757
... during the French Revolution
a mob set fire to her house.

672
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:12,313
And her mother died... saving her.

673
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:17,270
"Look, the place that
cradled me is burning."

674
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:33,153
Can you hear
the heartache in her voice?

675
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:36,911
Can you feel it, Joe?

676
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:47,389
In come the strings
and it changes everything.

677
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:51,553
The music fills with a hope.

678
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:57,909
And that'll change again. Listen.

679
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:02,909
Listen.

680
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:09,275
"l bring sorrow
to those who love me."

681
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:13,069
Oh, that single cello.

682
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:26,353
"lt was during this sorrow
that love came to me."

683
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:37,231
"A voice filled with harmony."

684
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:42,353
"lt said, live still."

685
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:48,114
"l am life."

686
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:51,718
"Heaven is in your eyes."

687
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:37,630
"ls everything around you
just the blood and mud?"

688
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:41,270
"l am divine."

689
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:45,194
"l am oblivion."

690
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:50,596
"l am the god...

691
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:57,594
... that comes down from the heavens
and makes of the earth a heaven."

692
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:12,795
"l am love!"

693
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:17,275
"l am love."

694
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:37,790
I'd better get out of here.

695
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:43,117
Lisa... I told her that...

696
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:49,955
- I'll look over the Q & A.
- No, you're ready.

697
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:29,396
Jesus...

698
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:55,470
God!

699
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:40,716
I love you, little Larice.

700
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:18,873
Left hand on the Bible.

701
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:22,396
Do you swear to tell the truth?

702
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:25,597
- I do.
- Please be seated.

703
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:31,314
Andrew...

704
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:39,034
Can you describe the circumstances
in which you joined Wyant Wheeler?

705
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:43,870
Wyant Wheeler
aggressively recruited me.

706
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:51,435
The were a very prestigious firm.
I was impressed with the partners.

707
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:54,990
- lncluding Charles Wheeler?
- Particularly Charles.

708
01:23:55,160 --> 01:24:00,917
- What impressed you?
- The kind of lawyer he was.

709
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:08,555
- What kind was that?
- One of great legal knowledge.

710
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:14,477
A genuine leader. Gifted at
bringing out the best in others.

711
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:20,988
An awesome ability to illuminate
complex legal problems -

712
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:26,154
- to a colleague, a courtroom,
to the man on the street.

713
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:32,589
The kind of man who can play three
sets of tennis but doesn't sweat.

714
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:39,438
Underneath an elegant surface
he has an adventurous spirit.

715
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:46,118
Did you ever tell Charles Wheeler
you were gay?

716
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:49,950
- No, I didn't.
- Why not?

717
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:55,069
In a law firm you're not really
supposed to have a personal life.

718
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:59,597
I did plan
to tell Charles eventually.

719
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:03,878
But then something happened
at the racquet club.

720
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:07,430
About three years ago.

721
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:11,559
Somebody started telling jokes.

722
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:18,876
What do you call a woman who
has PMS and ESP at the same time?

723
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:23,670
- I don't know.
- A bitch who knows everything.

724
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,718
Sounds like somebody I know.

725
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:34,798
- How does a faggot fake an orgasm?
- He throws hot yogurt on your back.

726
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:41,798
- How did that make you feel?
- Relieved...

727
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:47,796
... that I never told him I was gay.
Just very relieved.

728
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:55,792
- Are you a good lawyer?
- I'm an excellent lawyer.

729
01:25:55,960 --> 01:26:00,476
- What makes you that?
- I love the law.

730
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:04,394
I know the law.
I excel at practicing it.

731
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:11,193
- What do you love about the law?
- Many things.

732
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:16,115
What do I love most about the law?

733
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:23,311
Every now and again,
not often, but occasionally, -

734
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:29,953
- you get to be a part
of justice being done.

735
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:37,115
It really is quite a thrill
when that happens.

736
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:45,550
Thank you, Andrew.

737
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:54,433
You said earlier you aspired to be
a person of adventurous spirit.

738
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:57,876
- Is that correct?
- Something like that.

739
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:05,469
- Do you take risks?
- In this job you have to.

740
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:13,112
Did your doctor ever tell you
to reduce stress?

741
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:20,789
That long hours at work
might speed up your illness?

742
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:26,833
My doctor mentioned
the impact AlDS... Excuse me...

743
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:31,915
My doctor mentioned the impact
of stress on the immune system.

744
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:38,997
Have you ever been to the
Stallion Showcase Cinema?

745
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:52,116
I've been to...

746
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:54,919
... that...

747
01:27:55,080 --> 01:28:01,110
I've been to that theatre
three times in my life.

748
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:05,512
- What type of movies do they show?
- Gay movies.

749
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:09,309
- Gay pornographic movies?
- Yes.

750
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:12,677
Objection, Your Honour.

751
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:18,119
This kind of questioning is vital
to the issue of credibility.

752
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:22,034
Let's see where this is going.

753
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:24,270
Continue, counsellor.

754
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:30,993
- Do men have sex there?
- Some men.

755
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:35,199
Have you ever had sex
with anyone in that theatre?

756
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:38,397
- I'm Robert.
- Andy.

757
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:41,996
Yes, once.

758
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:47,310
Approximately what year
did that event take place?

759
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:53,592
I guess it was 1984...

760
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:56,752
... 84 or 85.

761
01:28:56,920 --> 01:29:02,836
Were you aware in 1984
of the fatal disease called AlDS?

762
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:07,869
And that you could contract it
through sexual activity?

763
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:12,989
I'd heard of something...

764
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:17,595
The gay plague.
The gay cancer.

765
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:24,552
We didn't know how you could get it
or that it killed you.

766
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:29,314
Do you need a break, Mr. Beckett?

767
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:33,678
No... I could use some water.

768
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:38,516
John, would you bring
Mr. Beckett some water, please?

769
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:45,475
While you were at Wyant Wheeler,
you did hide the fact -

770
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:49,758
- that you were an active
homosexual. is that correct?

771
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:55,790
No. That's not correct.
I never lied about it.

772
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:09,075
As a homosexual, one is often
forced to conceal one's sexuality.

773
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:13,677
- lsn't that right?
- In some circumstances, yes.

774
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:19,676
You have spent your life pretending
to be something that you're not.

775
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:24,630
- Concealment and dishonesty...
- I object.

776
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:27,394
I'll withdraw it.

777
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:35,148
Were you living with
Miguel Alvarez in 1984, -

778
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:37,834
- when you had your...

779
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:43,279
... anonymous sexual encounter
in the porn theatre?

780
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:45,476
Yes.

781
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:53,073
- So you could have infected him?
- Miguel has not been infected.

782
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:59,554
You didn't answer my question.
Could you have infected him?

783
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:04,990
Yes.

784
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:11,713
You say the lesions on your face
were clearly visible.

785
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:13,950
That's right.

786
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:18,193
Is it your contention that when
the partners saw these lesions, -

787
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:23,753
- they leapt to the conclusion
you had AlDS and they fired you?

788
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:28,874
As painful as it is...

789
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:35,434
... to accuse my colleagues
of such reprehensible behaviour...

790
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:39,912
... it is the only conclusion
I could come to.

791
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:44,392
Do you have any lesions on your face
at this time?

792
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:51,354
One, here... by my ear.

793
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:57,155
- May I approach the witness?
- Yes, you may.

794
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:12,277
Remembering that you're under oath,
answering truthfully...

795
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:17,958
Can you see the lesions on your face
in this mirror from three feet away?

796
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:22,159
Answering truthfully.

797
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:34,590
At the time I was fired,
the lesions were much bigger.

798
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:39,151
Answer my question, please.

799
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:46,674
No, I can't really see them.

800
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:52,479
No more questions.

801
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:57,196
We'll take a break now.
We'll reconvene in the morning.

802
01:32:57,360 --> 01:32:59,669
I hate this case.

803
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:07,349
- I'd like five minutes in redirect.
- Mr. Beckett, can you go on?

804
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:10,159
Three minutes.

805
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:13,915
May I borrow your mirror, please?

806
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:17,198
Andrew...

807
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:22,994
Do you have any lesions
on your body -

808
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:29,076
- that resemble the lesions you had
on your face when you were fired?

809
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:33,552
Yes, on my torso.

810
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:38,430
I would like to ask Andrew
to remove his shirt -

811
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:42,115
- so we can all
see what we're talking about.

812
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:46,592
Objection. It would
unfairly influence the jury.

813
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:50,753
If Andrew's illness forced him
to use a wheelchair, -

814
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:55,675
- would he have to park it outside
so as not to influence the jury?

815
01:33:55,840 --> 01:34:00,118
This is AlDS.
Let's see what we're talking about.

816
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:06,515
I'll allow it.
Please remove your shirt.

817
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:22,269
- God, what a nightmare.
- He asked for it.

818
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:09,554
- Can you see these lesions?
- Yes.

819
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:13,360
Thank you.

820
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:26,871
- Do you swear to tell the truth?
- I do.

821
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:29,998
Please be seated.

822
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:42,279
Mr. Wheeler, were you aware
that Andrew Beckett had AlDS -

823
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:46,752
- at the time of his departure
from Wyant Wheeler?

824
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:50,071
- No.
- For absolute clarity...

825
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:55,439
Did you fire Andrew Beckett
because he had AlDS?

826
01:35:55,600 --> 01:36:00,037
No. I did not fire Andrew Beckett
because he had AlDS.

827
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:04,990
Can you explain in a way
that leaves no doubt -

828
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:10,109
- why you promoted
Andrew Beckett in your firm?

829
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:16,389
And then, most importantly,
why you asked him to leave?

830
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:25,069
If you're the owner of a ball club,
you recruit the hot rookie.

831
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:34,672
Andy was tremendously promising.
Fresh out of Penn. Crackerjack.

832
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:42,633
That's why we hired him,
and why we stuck by him for so long.

833
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:48,796
Why did you give him
all this opportunity?

834
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:54,080
When you've groomed someone
the way we groomed Andy, -

835
01:36:54,240 --> 01:36:59,792
- nurturing him and lavishing
special treatment on him, -

836
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:02,554
- it's quite an investment.

837
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:06,190
We were waiting for the promise
to deliver.

838
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:14,074
But ultimately, we could not ignore
the gap between reality and promise.

839
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:23,916
Thank you, Mr. Wheeler.

840
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:29,195
No more questions, Your Honour.

841
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:37,072
- Objection, Your Honour.
- All right, Mr. Miller.

842
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:41,199
Mr. Wheeler, you are magnificent.

843
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:46,229
You are my hero. Andrew's right.
You are the greatest.

844
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:48,789
Are you gay?

845
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:52,477
Objection.

846
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:58,280
- How dare you!
- The witness will kindly answer.

847
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:03,794
No, I am not a homosexual.

848
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:09,273
Isn't it true that when you realized
your future senior partner was gay -

849
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:16,073
- and had AlDS, it drove fear right
through your heterosexual heart?

850
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:20,950
Remembering the hugs
and the handshakes. The sauna.

851
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:25,557
The friendly pats on the backside
that guys exchange sometimes.

852
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:31,272
It made you say, "My God!
What does this say about me?"

853
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:34,716
Objection.

854
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:39,713
The witness will please
respond to the question.

855
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:46,399
Mr. Miller, your innuendos
and locker-room fantasies -

856
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:52,476
- can't hide the fact your client
only worked when he wanted to.

857
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:56,758
Telling us what he thought we needed
to know about who he really was.

858
01:38:56,920 --> 01:39:03,951
Andy insisted on bending the rules.
His work suffered as a result.

859
01:39:04,120 --> 01:39:08,113
Explain it like I'm a six-year-old,
because I just don't get it.

860
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:12,319
Who makes these rules? You?

861
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:17,554
Read your Bible, Mr. Miller.
Old and New Testament.

862
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:19,995
Valuable rules.

863
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:24,756
- Excuse me...
- Andrew?

864
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:28,191
I can't...

865
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:36,357
Somebody get a doctor.

866
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:40,754
Turn him over.

867
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:43,832
Call an ambulance.

868
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:48,834
Let him breathe. Please, make room.

869
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:56,393
It's not working!

870
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:59,996
It's making him worse!

871
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:05,998
Did you notice any changes
in Andrew's appearance -

872
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:09,835
- in the year
leading up to his termination?

873
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:15,757
- Yes, I did.
- Were they for the better or worse?

874
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:19,879
Sometimes for the better,
but generally for the worse.

875
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:26,036
Mr. Seidman, what did you think
caused these changes in appearance?

876
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:29,954
I was afraid...

877
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:33,237
I suspected Andy had AlDS.

878
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:37,559
- Order!
- Thank you. Your witness.

879
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:45,115
Did you share your suspicions
with any of the other partners -

880
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:49,592
- before the decision
to fire Andrew Beckett was made?

881
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:56,199
No, I didn't mention it to anyone.
Not even Andy.

882
01:40:56,360 --> 01:41:01,115
I didn't even give him a chance
to talk about it.

883
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:06,070
And I think I'm going to regret that
for as long as I live.

884
01:41:06,240 --> 01:41:09,710
- Any more questions?
- That's all.

885
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:14,795
They are saying
that he wasn't a good lawyer.

886
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:21,195
Yet they gave him a lawsuit for
one of their most important clients.

887
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:25,717
They say that doesn't prove
anything. It was just a test.

888
01:41:25,880 --> 01:41:28,792
They call it a "carrot".

889
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:32,748
They wanted to see
if he would rise to the occasion.

890
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:39,712
Say I had to send up a pilot up
in a plane that cost $350 million.

891
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:43,111
Who am I gonna put in that plane?

892
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:47,876
Some rookie, to see
if he can rise to the challenge?

893
01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:52,158
Or am I gonna give that assignment
to my best pilot?

894
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:57,235
My most experienced... my top gun.

895
01:41:57,400 --> 01:42:00,358
I just don't get that.

896
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:06,914
Will somebody explain it to me...
"like I'm a six-year-old".

897
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:11,112
- Juror number 6?
- I agree.

898
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:13,919
- Juror number 7?
- I agree.

899
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:22,197
- Juror number 10?
- I disagree.

900
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:24,828
- Juror number 1 1?
- I agree.

901
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:28,356
- Juror number 12?
- I agree.

902
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:33,589
- Have you awarded any damages?
- Yes, we have.

903
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:39,039
For back pay and loss of benefits,
we award $143,000.

904
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:43,637
For mental anguish and humiliation,
we award $100,000.

905
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:49,397
And for punitive damages,
we award $4,782,000.

906
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:55,994
You may record the verdict.

907
01:42:56,160 --> 01:43:00,915
Everyone remain seated
until the jury is removed.

908
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:08,275
This trial is now concluded.

909
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:13,913
Congratulations.

910
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:19,438
- We'll get a reversal on this one.
- We'll get started in the morning.

911
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:22,990
Congratulations, Mr. Miller.
I'll see you at the appeal.

912
01:43:23,160 --> 01:43:26,436
Congratulations, well done.

913
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:32,911
- Thanks a lot.
- I'll see you at the hospital.

914
01:43:40,360 --> 01:43:42,590
Mr. Miller, hi.

915
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:47,038
He's just down the hall.

916
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,992
I doubt he'll leave the hospital.

917
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:57,597
If he does, he won't be
how he was before this crisis.

918
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:00,593
He's lost the vision in one eye.

919
01:44:00,760 --> 01:44:04,992
And because of CMV
he will not regain his vision.

920
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:09,676
- Next door on the right.
- CMV has ravaged his body.

921
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:19,029
Congratulations.

922
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:22,431
The man of the hour.

923
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:32,119
Hi, Joe.

924
01:44:32,280 --> 01:44:35,158
We are so grateful to you.

925
01:44:35,320 --> 01:44:42,749
- Can I take that for you?
- It's some cheese... and stuff.

926
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:08,633
How are you doing?

927
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:23,472
What do you call a thousand lawyers
chained together on the sea bed?

928
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:29,033
- I don't know.
- A good start.

929
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:39,997
Excellent work, counsellor.

930
01:45:41,680 --> 01:45:44,399
I thank you.

931
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:49,953
It was great working with you,
counsellor.

932
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:23,395
I'd better go.

933
01:46:25,680 --> 01:46:28,478
Sure thing.

934
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:31,313
I'll see you later?

935
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:38,312
Thanks for stopping by.

936
01:46:39,880 --> 01:46:43,555
I'll see you again.

937
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:54,439
I'll keep it on ice for you.

938
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:21,230
- He's a fighter.
- I just want to get him home.

939
01:47:21,880 --> 01:47:25,668
Thank you, Joe.

940
01:47:50,240 --> 01:47:54,870
What do you call a thousand lawyers
chained together on the sea bed?

941
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:58,000
- A good start.
- Very amusing.

942
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,035
- A good start.
- Very amusing.

943
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:05,319
I'll see you tomorrow, buddy.

944
01:48:14,200 --> 01:48:17,829
God bless you, Andy.

945
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:25,276
Good night, son.
Try to get some rest.

946
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:30,639
- I love you, Andy.
- I love you too, Dad.

947
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:37,190
See you first thing tomorrow.

948
01:48:58,280 --> 01:49:04,515
- See you tomorrow.
- Come on, sweetheart.

949
01:49:14,240 --> 01:49:17,755
Good night, my angel.

950
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:21,595
My sweet boy.

951
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:20,556
Let me help you.

952
01:50:27,680 --> 01:50:31,070
Miguel...

953
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:37,035
I'm ready.

954
01:50:55,800 --> 01:50:59,156
Joe, it's Miguel.

955
