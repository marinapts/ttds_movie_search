1
00:01:22,161 --> 00:01:25,957
Everybody, heads up!
Heads up! Keep clear!

2
00:01:26,096 --> 00:01:29,162
Keep it clear!
Okay, down!

3
00:01:29,296 --> 00:01:33,038
Andale, si! Vamonos.

4
00:01:33,167 --> 00:01:36,549
Keep it goin'!
Come on!

5
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:42,756
That's good, stay!
Slow it down.

6
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:45,379
No lo vayan a tirar!
Cuidado!

7
00:01:45,582 --> 00:01:49,510
Traigala, traigala!

8
00:01:52,525 --> 00:01:55,427
Okay, pushing team,
move in there. Move it!

9
00:01:55,565 --> 00:01:58,913
Cuidado, vamos! I want
tasers on full charge.

10
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,441
Aaah!

11
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,434
Come on,
step back in.

12
00:02:03,564 --> 00:02:05,953
Move it! Adelante! Puje, puje!

13
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,939
And push!

14
00:02:14,922 --> 00:02:17,311
We're locked.
Loading team, step away.

15
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:19,782
Gate keeper!

16
00:02:25,864 --> 00:02:28,482
Jophery,
raise the gate.

17
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:42,177
Aaah!

18
00:02:42,311 --> 00:02:44,383
Aaah!

19
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:47,877
Block the opening!
Don't let her get out!

20
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,852
Aaah!

21
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:57,115
Aaah!

22
00:02:57,252 --> 00:02:59,903
Work her back!

23
00:03:06,499 --> 00:03:10,296
Aaah!

24
00:03:10,435 --> 00:03:13,336
Shoot her!

25
00:03:13,474 --> 00:03:16,027
Shoot her!
Aaah!

26
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,941
Apuesto mil pesos
que se cae.

27
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,515
Hola, Juanito. Hola. Bienvenido.

28
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:49,749
What's this I hear
at the airport?

29
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:52,153
Hammond's not even here?
He sends his apologies.

30
00:03:52,285 --> 00:03:54,871
We are facing a $20-million lawsuit
by the family of that worker,

31
00:03:55,005 --> 00:03:57,787
and you're telling me that Hammond
can't even be bothered to see me?

32
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:00,371
He wants to be with his
daughter. She's getting a divorce.

33
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:03,803
I understand that, but we've been
advised to deal with the situation now.

34
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,860
The insurance company
- Okay?

35
00:04:07,995 --> 00:04:10,613
The underwriters feel that
the accident has raised...

36
00:04:10,746 --> 00:04:13,015
some very serious safety
questions about the park.

37
00:04:13,146 --> 00:04:15,415
That makes the investors
very, very anxious.

38
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:19,320
I had to promise to conduct a
very thorough on-site inspection.

39
00:04:19,514 --> 00:04:22,547
Hammond hates inspections.
They slow everything down.

40
00:04:22,745 --> 00:04:25,014
Juanito, they'll pull
the funding. Jefe, jefe!

41
00:04:25,144 --> 00:04:27,283
That'll slow him down more.
Encontramos otros mosquitos.

42
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,620
Seguro? A ver, muestrame. Si, venga.

43
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:33,810
Ooh! Aaah!
Watch your head.

44
00:04:33,943 --> 00:04:36,693
If two experts
sign off on the island,

45
00:04:36,823 --> 00:04:38,765
the insurance guys
will back off.

46
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:41,488
I've already got Ian Malcolm,
but they think he's too trendy.

47
00:04:41,622 --> 00:04:44,557
They want Alan Grant. Grant?
You'll never get him out of Montana.

48
00:04:44,694 --> 00:04:46,636
Luz, mas luz!
Why not?

49
00:04:46,774 --> 00:04:48,977
Muchachos, echenme luz!
Si.

50
00:04:49,109 --> 00:04:50,898
Why not?

51
00:04:52,597 --> 00:04:55,444
Because Grant's like me.

52
00:04:56,341 --> 00:04:59,155
He's a digger.

53
00:05:01,236 --> 00:05:03,308
Que lindo eres.

54
00:05:03,412 --> 00:05:06,128
Vas a ser-

55
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:44,490
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler,
we're ready to try again.

56
00:05:44,622 --> 00:05:48,550
I hate computers. The feeling's mutual.

57
00:05:59,499 --> 00:06:02,314
You'll get a reading from that.

58
00:06:02,476 --> 00:06:05,126
Take a look.

59
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:07,560
Did it work?

60
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:10,559
How long does this take? It
should bring an immediate return.

61
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:14,210
You shoot the radar into the ground,
and the bone bounces the image back.

62
00:06:14,346 --> 00:06:16,418
Bounces it back.

63
00:06:16,554 --> 00:06:20,743
This new program's incredible.

64
00:06:20,873 --> 00:06:24,418
A few more years'development, and
we won't even have to dig anymore.

65
00:06:24,553 --> 00:06:26,658
Where's the fun
in that?

66
00:06:26,856 --> 00:06:30,979
It's a little distorted, but I
don't think it's the computer. Oh.

67
00:06:31,112 --> 00:06:34,526
Postmortem contraction of
the posterior neck ligaments.

68
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:37,695
Velociraptor?
Yes, good shape too.

69
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:41,147
It's five, six feet high, I'm guessing
nine feet long. Look at the extraordinary-

70
00:06:41,286 --> 00:06:43,293
What'd you do?
He touched it.

71
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,470
Dr. Grant's not
machine compatible.

72
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:48,061
Hell, they've
got it in for me.

73
00:06:48,197 --> 00:06:50,585
And look at the half-moon
shaped bones in the wrist.

74
00:06:50,724 --> 00:06:53,659
It's no wonder these guys
learned how to fly.

75
00:06:53,797 --> 00:06:57,374
No, seriously.

76
00:06:57,508 --> 00:07:00,922
Well, maybe dinosaurs have more
in common with present-day birds...

77
00:07:01,124 --> 00:07:03,579
than they do
with reptiles.

78
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:06,462
Look at the pubic bone, turned
backward, just like a bird.

79
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:10,391
Look at the vertebrae, full of air
sacs and hollows, just like a bird.

80
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,628
And even the word "raptor"
means "bird of prey. "

81
00:07:13,761 --> 00:07:16,412
That doesn't look
very scary.

82
00:07:16,545 --> 00:07:18,454
That kid's a pistol.

83
00:07:18,593 --> 00:07:21,888
More like
a six-foot turkey.

84
00:07:22,017 --> 00:07:25,147
A turkey, huh?
Oh, no.

85
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,557
Here we go. Okay, try to imagine
yourself in the Cretaceous period.

86
00:07:29,696 --> 00:07:33,688
You get your first look at this
six-foot turkey as you enter a clearing.

87
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:37,596
He moves like a bird,
lightly bobbing his head.

88
00:07:37,726 --> 00:07:40,312
And you keep still because you
think that maybe his visual acuity...

89
00:07:40,446 --> 00:07:43,707
is based on movement, like T-Rex,
and he'll lose you if you don't move.

90
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:47,066
But no,
not Velociraptor.

91
00:07:47,198 --> 00:07:50,546
You stare at him, and
he just stares right back.

92
00:07:50,685 --> 00:07:52,572
And that's when
the attack comes.

93
00:07:52,701 --> 00:07:55,799
Not from the front,
but from the side.

94
00:07:55,932 --> 00:07:59,347
From the other two raptors
you didn't even know were there.

95
00:07:59,483 --> 00:08:02,898
Because Velociraptor's
a pack hunter, you see.

96
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:05,750
He uses coordinated
attack patterns,

97
00:08:05,915 --> 00:08:08,729
and he is
out in force today.

98
00:08:08,923 --> 00:08:11,672
And he slashes at you
with this,

99
00:08:11,802 --> 00:08:15,828
a six-inch retractable claw,
like a razor, on the middle toe.

100
00:08:15,961 --> 00:08:18,895
He doesn't bother to bite
your jugular like a lion, say.

101
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:24,269
No, no. He slashes at you
here or here.

102
00:08:24,408 --> 00:08:26,131
Oh, Alan.

103
00:08:26,264 --> 00:08:30,900
Or maybe across the belly,
spilling your intestines.

104
00:08:31,031 --> 00:08:35,853
The point is, you are alive
when they start to eat you.

105
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:42,220
So you know, try to show
a little respect. Okay.

106
00:08:49,109 --> 00:08:52,043
Hey, Alan, if you wanted
to scare the kid,

107
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,351
you could have pulled
a gun on him, you know.

108
00:08:54,484 --> 00:08:57,386
Yeah, I know.
Kids.

109
00:08:57,524 --> 00:09:00,819
You want to have one of
those? I don't want that kid.

110
00:09:00,948 --> 00:09:04,809
But a breed of child, Dr. Grant,
could be intriguing.

111
00:09:04,947 --> 00:09:07,914
I mean, what's so wrong
with kids? Oh, Ellie, look.

112
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:12,783
They're noisy, they're messy,
they're expensive. Cheap, cheap.

113
00:09:12,914 --> 00:09:15,248
They smell.
They do not smell.

114
00:09:15,441 --> 00:09:18,191
Give me a break! Some of
them smell. Babies smell.

115
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,499
Cover the site!
Cover up the dig!

116
00:09:27,632 --> 00:09:29,901
Tell them to shut down!
Shut down! Cut the machine!

117
00:09:30,031 --> 00:09:32,714
Cover it all up!
Pull it over!

118
00:09:32,847 --> 00:09:35,563
Just cut it,
will ya?

119
00:09:35,695 --> 00:09:38,215
Cut it out!
Shut it down!

120
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,684
What?

121
00:09:52,685 --> 00:09:55,434
What the hell do you think
you're doing in here?

122
00:09:55,564 --> 00:09:59,361
Hey, we were saving that!

123
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,736
For today.
I guarantee it.

124
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:06,089
Who in God's name do you
think you are? John Hammond,

125
00:10:06,219 --> 00:10:10,244
and I'm delighted to meet you
finally in person, Dr. Grant.

126
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,352
Mr. Hammond
- Well, I can see that my, uh,

127
00:10:12,553 --> 00:10:15,041
50,000 a year
has been well spent.

128
00:10:15,241 --> 00:10:17,029
Okay, who's the jerk?

129
00:10:17,161 --> 00:10:20,324
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr.
- Sattler.

130
00:10:20,457 --> 00:10:23,009
Aha! Ellie, this is, uh, Mr. Hammond.

131
00:10:23,112 --> 00:10:25,926
I'm sorry about the dramatic
entrance, Dr. Sattler,

132
00:10:26,056 --> 00:10:28,325
but we're in a wee bit of
a hurry. Did I say "jerk"?

133
00:10:28,456 --> 00:10:31,685
Will you have a drink? We won't let
it get warm. Come along, sit down.

134
00:10:31,815 --> 00:10:34,019
Here, let me
- I'll just get a glass or two.

135
00:10:34,151 --> 00:10:36,005
No, no, no, no,
I can manage this.

136
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,044
I know my way
around the kitchen.

137
00:10:38,182 --> 00:10:40,287
Now, I'll get
right to the point.

138
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:44,251
Um, I like ya,
both of ya.

139
00:10:44,453 --> 00:10:46,973
I can tell instantly
about people.

140
00:10:47,173 --> 00:10:49,027
It's a gift.

141
00:10:50,756 --> 00:10:54,072
I own an island off
the coast of Costa Rica.

142
00:10:54,212 --> 00:10:56,121
I've leased it
from the government,

143
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,903
and I've spent the last five years
setting up a kind of biological preserve.

144
00:11:00,036 --> 00:11:02,305
Really spectacular.
Spared no expense.

145
00:11:02,435 --> 00:11:05,696
Make the one I've got down in
Kenya look like a petting zoo.

146
00:11:05,827 --> 00:11:09,568
And there's no doubt our attractions
will drive kids out of their minds.

147
00:11:09,698 --> 00:11:12,959
And what are those? Small
versions of adults, honey.

148
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,024
And not just kids, everyone.
We're going to open next year.

149
00:11:16,225 --> 00:11:18,232
That is, if the lawyers
don't kill me first.

150
00:11:18,432 --> 00:11:20,439
I don't care for
lawyers. Do you?

151
00:11:20,641 --> 00:11:23,674
Oh, we, uh, don't know any.
I don't really know any.

152
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,596
Well, I do,
I'm afraid.

153
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:29,110
There's a particular pebble in
my shoe, represents my investors.

154
00:11:29,247 --> 00:11:33,502
Says that they insist on outside
opinions. What kind of opinions?

155
00:11:33,631 --> 00:11:36,500
Well, your kind, not to
put too fine a point on it.

156
00:11:36,638 --> 00:11:38,427
I mean, let's face it.

157
00:11:38,558 --> 00:11:40,979
In your particular field,
you're the top minds.

158
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:45,078
And if I could just persuade you
to sign off on the park,

159
00:11:45,213 --> 00:11:47,187
you know, give it
your endorsement,

160
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:49,396
maybe even pen
a wee testimonial,

161
00:11:49,596 --> 00:11:51,930
I could get back on
"shedual," uh, schedule.

162
00:11:52,124 --> 00:11:55,833
Why would they care what we
think? What kind of park is this?

163
00:11:58,332 --> 00:12:01,146
It's right up your alley.

164
00:12:01,275 --> 00:12:03,576
I'll tell you what.

165
00:12:03,707 --> 00:12:06,935
Why don't you come down, just
the pair of ya, for the weekend?

166
00:12:07,067 --> 00:12:09,750
I'd love to have an opinion
of a paleobotanist as well.

167
00:12:09,882 --> 00:12:13,394
I've got a jet
standing by at Choteau.

168
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:16,147
Look, I'm sorry. This
is impossible. Yeah, we-

169
00:12:16,281 --> 00:12:18,103
We just dug up
a new skeleton.

170
00:12:18,265 --> 00:12:22,039
I could compensate you
by fully funding your dig.

171
00:12:22,232 --> 00:12:25,014
And this is a very unusual
time. The timing is-

172
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:26,932
For a further three years.

173
00:12:27,064 --> 00:12:28,852
Hmm?

174
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:31,349
Well, uh,

175
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:33,300
where's the plane?

176
00:12:34,903 --> 00:12:37,172
Yeah, okay. Cheers. Cheers.

177
00:12:37,302 --> 00:12:41,393
Okay.

178
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,598
Yo, Dodgson!

179
00:13:27,151 --> 00:13:29,540
You shouldn't
use my name.

180
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:32,710
Dodgson, Dodgson!
We've got Dodgson here!

181
00:13:32,847 --> 00:13:36,163
See? Nobody cares.
Nice hat.

182
00:13:36,302 --> 00:13:38,571
What are you tryin' to
look like, a secret agent?

183
00:13:38,702 --> 00:13:41,702
Well?
Seven fifty.

184
00:13:41,869 --> 00:13:44,008
On delivery, 50,000 more
for each viable embryo.

185
00:13:44,141 --> 00:13:47,402
That's 1.5 million, if you get
all 15 species off the island.

186
00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:49,868
Oh, I'll get 'em all.
Remember, viable embryos.

187
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,265
They're no use to us
if they don't survive.

188
00:13:52,396 --> 00:13:55,014
Oh! How am I supposed
to transport them?

189
00:13:57,835 --> 00:14:00,999
The bottom screws open.

190
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,986
That's great.
Oh, my God.

191
00:14:03,147 --> 00:14:05,121
It's cooled and
compartmentalized inside.

192
00:14:05,258 --> 00:14:09,000
Oh, that's great! Customs can
even check it if they want to.

193
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,039
Let me see. Oh! Go on.

194
00:14:11,178 --> 00:14:13,992
There's enough coolant inside
for 36 hours. No menthol?

195
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:16,576
The embryos have to be back
here in San Jose by then.

196
00:14:16,712 --> 00:14:18,600
That's up to your guy
on the boat.

197
00:14:18,729 --> 00:14:21,598
7:00 tomorrow night on the east
dock. Make sure he gets it right.

198
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:23,645
How are you planning
to beat security?

199
00:14:23,783 --> 00:14:25,671
I've got
an 18-minute window.

200
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,858
Eighteen minutes, and your company
catches up on ten years of research.

201
00:14:30,055 --> 00:14:32,291
Gracias, senor.

202
00:14:34,054 --> 00:14:36,803
Don't get cheap on me,
Dodgson.

203
00:14:38,054 --> 00:14:40,475
That was
Hammond's mistake.

204
00:14:53,668 --> 00:14:56,220
So you two, um,
dig up dinosaurs?

205
00:14:58,627 --> 00:15:01,474
Well-
We try to.

206
00:15:07,042 --> 00:15:09,213
You'll have to get used
to Dr. Malcolm.

207
00:15:09,346 --> 00:15:12,063
He suffers from a deplorable
excess of personality,

208
00:15:12,193 --> 00:15:15,542
especially for a mathematician.
Chaotician, actually.

209
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:17,503
John doesn't
subscribe to chaos,

210
00:15:17,633 --> 00:15:20,480
particularly what it has to say about
his science project. Codswallop, Ian.

211
00:15:20,576 --> 00:15:23,161
You've never been able to sufficiently
explain your concerns about the island.

212
00:15:23,295 --> 00:15:26,262
Oh,John,John. Because of the
behavior of the system in phase space?

213
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,017
A load, if I may say so, of
fashionable number crunching.

214
00:15:29,151 --> 00:15:31,061
Is not. I do wish you wouldn't do that.

215
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,012
Dr. Sattler, Dr. Grant,
you've heard of chaos theory?

216
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,404
No. No? Non-linear equations?

217
00:15:37,566 --> 00:15:39,420
Strange attractors?

218
00:15:40,989 --> 00:15:43,607
Dr. Sattler, I refuse
to believe that you...

219
00:15:43,741 --> 00:15:46,458
aren't familiar with
the concept of attraction.

220
00:15:48,668 --> 00:15:52,923
Hmm! I bring scientists,
you bring a rock star.

221
00:15:55,964 --> 00:15:57,752
There it is.

222
00:16:23,288 --> 00:16:25,076
Bad wind shears.

223
00:16:25,207 --> 00:16:27,476
We have to drop pretty fast,
so hold on,

224
00:16:27,607 --> 00:16:30,323
'cause it can be just
a little thrilling.

225
00:16:30,455 --> 00:16:33,651
Ya-hoo!

226
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,448
No, no, you need that piece
over here, and that piece-

227
00:16:58,579 --> 00:17:01,894
Look, we'll have landed
by the time you get it right.

228
00:18:16,873 --> 00:18:19,742
The full 50 miles of
perimeter fence are in place?

229
00:18:19,912 --> 00:18:23,227
And the concrete moats, and the
motion sensor tracking systems.

230
00:18:23,367 --> 00:18:26,596
Donald, dear boy, relax.
Try and enjoy yourself.

231
00:18:26,728 --> 00:18:28,669
Let's get something
straight,John.

232
00:18:28,806 --> 00:18:30,748
This is not
a weekend excursion.

233
00:18:30,886 --> 00:18:33,253
This is a serious investigation
of the stability of the island.

234
00:18:33,382 --> 00:18:36,099
Your investors, whom I
represent, are deeply concerned.

235
00:18:36,229 --> 00:18:39,076
Forty-eight hours from now, if they're
not convinced, I'm not convinced.

236
00:18:39,206 --> 00:18:41,791
I'll shut you down,
John.

237
00:18:41,925 --> 00:18:45,220
In 48 hours, I'llbe
accepting your apologies.

238
00:18:54,019 --> 00:18:58,274
All right, slow down.
Stop, stop, stop!

239
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:00,443
This shouldn't be here.

240
00:19:19,584 --> 00:19:21,918
Alan, this species of
veriforman's been extinct...

241
00:19:22,048 --> 00:19:24,252
since the Cretaceous Period.

242
00:19:24,383 --> 00:19:27,765
I mean, this thing is humongous.
What? What?

243
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:57,206
Look at that.

244
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,679
Um, it's- it's a dinosaur.
Uh-huh.

245
00:20:04,634 --> 00:20:06,739
You did it.

246
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:09,873
You crazy son of a bitch,
you did it.

247
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:12,692
Oh, Ellie, we could just tear up
the rule book on cold-bloodedness.

248
00:20:12,824 --> 00:20:14,712
It doesn't apply.
They're totally wrong.

249
00:20:14,841 --> 00:20:17,743
This is a warm-blooded creature.
This thing doesn't live in a swamp.

250
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,749
- This thing's got what, a 27-foot
neck? - The brachiosaur, 30.

251
00:20:20,952 --> 00:20:22,261
Thirty feet.

252
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,720
We're gonna make a fortune
with this place.

253
00:20:44,693 --> 00:20:48,041
How fast are they? Well,
we clocked the T-Rex...

254
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,344
at 32 miles an hour.

255
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:53,873
T- T-Rex?
Mm-hmm.

256
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:56,653
You said you've
got a T-Rex? Uh-huh.

257
00:20:56,787 --> 00:20:58,826
Say again.

258
00:20:58,962 --> 00:21:01,995
We have a T-Rex.
Oh.

259
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,879
Put your head
between your knees.

260
00:21:05,009 --> 00:21:08,271
Dr. Grant,
my dear Dr. Sattler,

261
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:12,143
welcome to Jurassic Park.

262
00:21:34,254 --> 00:21:36,742
They're moving in herds.

263
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:40,069
They do move in herds.

264
00:21:46,444 --> 00:21:48,931
How'd you do this?

265
00:21:51,691 --> 00:21:53,578
I'll show you.

266
00:22:16,072 --> 00:22:18,341
G'day, g'day, g'day!

267
00:22:18,472 --> 00:22:22,246
Now, the most advanced amusement
park in the entire world,

268
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,644
incorporating all
the latest technologies.

269
00:22:24,775 --> 00:22:28,070
And I'm not talking just about
rides, you know. Everybody has rides.

270
00:22:28,199 --> 00:22:32,322
No, we've made living biological
attractions so astounding...

271
00:22:32,454 --> 00:22:35,236
that they'll capture the
imagination of the entire planet.

272
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:38,746
So what are you
thinking?

273
00:22:38,885 --> 00:22:43,107
That we're out of a job.
Don't you mean "extinct"?

274
00:22:49,476 --> 00:22:51,810
Well, now, why don't
you all sit down?

275
00:22:51,939 --> 00:22:54,208
Uh, Donald,
sit down, sit down.

276
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:56,378
Ah, here.
Here he comes.

277
00:22:56,514 --> 00:22:58,936
Well, here I come.
Yes.

278
00:23:01,602 --> 00:23:04,417
Hello, hello. Say hello. Say hello.

279
00:23:04,545 --> 00:23:06,814
Hello.
H- Hello.

280
00:23:06,945 --> 00:23:10,840
Hello,John. Oh, yes, I've got lines.

281
00:23:10,977 --> 00:23:14,108
Well, fine, fine, I guess.
But how did I get here?

282
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,760
Uh, uh, well,
let me show you.

283
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:20,092
First I'll need a drop
of blood, your blood.

284
00:23:20,224 --> 00:23:22,492
Right.

285
00:23:22,623 --> 00:23:24,826
Ooh! John, that hurt.

286
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:27,675
Relax, John, it's all part
of the miracle of cloning.

287
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:30,806
Hello,John.
Hello,John.

288
00:23:30,974 --> 00:23:33,243
Hello.
Cloned from what?

289
00:23:33,406 --> 00:23:35,674
Loy extraction has never
recreated an intact D.N.A. strand.

290
00:23:35,806 --> 00:23:37,660
Not without
massive sequence gaps.

291
00:23:37,789 --> 00:23:39,992
Paleo-D.N.A.
from what source?

292
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:42,612
Where do you get a
100-million-year-old dinosaur blood?

293
00:23:42,748 --> 00:23:44,537
Shhh!

294
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,561
What?
What?

295
00:23:49,692 --> 00:23:53,368
Oh, well, Mr. D.N.A.!
Where did you come from?

296
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:55,321
From your blood.

297
00:23:55,451 --> 00:23:57,720
Just one drop of
your blood contains...

298
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:00,184
billions of strands of D.N.A.,
the building blocks of life.

299
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:06,646
A D.N.A. strand like me is a
blueprint for building a living thing.

300
00:24:06,777 --> 00:24:10,704
And sometimes, animals that went
extinct millions of years ago,

301
00:24:10,841 --> 00:24:14,702
like dinosaurs, left their
blueprints behind for us to find.

302
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,044
We just had to know
where to look.

303
00:24:17,176 --> 00:24:21,583
100 million years ago, there
were mosquitoes, just like today.

304
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:27,567
And just like today, they fed on
the blood of animals, even dinosaurs.

305
00:24:27,702 --> 00:24:29,677
Sometimes,
after bitin'a dinosaur,

306
00:24:29,814 --> 00:24:32,334
the mosquito would land
on the branch of a tree...

307
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,379
and get stuck in the sap.

308
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:37,932
After a long time,
the tree sap would get hard...

309
00:24:38,133 --> 00:24:41,002
and become fossilized,
just like a dinosaur bone,

310
00:24:41,205 --> 00:24:44,270
preserving the mosquito inside.

311
00:24:44,404 --> 00:24:48,681
This fossilized tree sap,
which we call amber,

312
00:24:48,819 --> 00:24:53,292
waited for millions of years
with the mosquito inside.

313
00:24:53,427 --> 00:24:55,369
Until Jurassic Park
scientists came along.

314
00:24:55,507 --> 00:24:58,572
Using sophisticated techniques,

315
00:24:58,707 --> 00:25:01,390
they extract the preserved blood
from the mosquito,

316
00:25:01,522 --> 00:25:05,166
and bingo.:
dino D.N.A.

317
00:25:05,297 --> 00:25:09,999
A full D.N.A. strand contains
three billion genetic codes.

318
00:25:10,128 --> 00:25:14,318
If we looked at screens like these
once a second for eight hours a day,

319
00:25:14,448 --> 00:25:18,222
it'd take two years to look at
the entire D.N.A. strand.

320
00:25:18,352 --> 00:25:20,140
It's that long.

321
00:25:20,272 --> 00:25:23,500
Since it's so old,
it's full of holes.

322
00:25:23,631 --> 00:25:26,052
Now that's where our
geneticists take over.

323
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:29,289
Thinkin'machine super-computers
and gene sequencers...

324
00:25:29,423 --> 00:25:32,324
break down the strand
in minutes.

325
00:25:32,461 --> 00:25:37,578
And virtual-reality displays show our
geneticists the gaps in the D.N.A. sequence.

326
00:25:37,709 --> 00:25:42,117
We use the complete D.N.A. of
a frog to fill in the holes...

327
00:25:42,316 --> 00:25:44,705
and complete the code.

328
00:25:44,908 --> 00:25:46,217
Phew!

329
00:25:46,348 --> 00:25:49,163
And now, we can make
a baby dinosaur.

330
00:25:51,915 --> 00:25:53,638
This score is only temporary.

331
00:25:53,771 --> 00:25:56,454
It all has very dramatic music,
of course. Rum-pum-pum!

332
00:25:56,587 --> 00:25:58,855
A march or something.
It hasn't been written yet.

333
00:25:58,986 --> 00:26:01,985
And then, of course,
the tour moves on.

334
00:26:09,737 --> 00:26:11,777
Well, lookie here!

335
00:26:11,976 --> 00:26:14,245
Those hard-workin'cowpokes
you see behind the glass-

336
00:26:14,376 --> 00:26:16,743
This is overwhelming,
John.

337
00:26:16,936 --> 00:26:20,863
Are- Are these characters,
uh, auto-erotica?

338
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:23,683
No, no, no, we have no
animatronics here, no.

339
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:26,531
Those people are the real
miracle workers of Jurassic Park.

340
00:26:26,663 --> 00:26:30,143
...D.N.A. in unfertilized
emu or ostrich eggs.

341
00:26:30,278 --> 00:26:33,594
Wait a minute. How do you
interrupt the cellular mitosis?

342
00:26:33,734 --> 00:26:37,214
Can't we see the unfertilized
eggs? Shortly, shortly, shortly.

343
00:26:37,349 --> 00:26:40,665
Now, a whole team of
genetic engineers-

344
00:26:40,805 --> 00:26:44,001
Can't
- Can't you stop these things? I'm sorry, it's kind of a ride.

345
00:26:44,196 --> 00:26:46,977
One, two, three.

346
00:26:47,108 --> 00:26:49,344
Uh-
You can't do that.

347
00:26:49,475 --> 00:26:51,646
What?
Can they do that?

348
00:26:53,315 --> 00:26:55,453
A reminder.:

349
00:26:55,586 --> 00:26:58,139
The boat for the mainland
will be leaving at 1900 hours.

350
00:26:58,274 --> 00:27:03,609
All personnel be at the dock no
later than 1845. No exceptions.

351
00:27:03,746 --> 00:27:07,128
G'day, Henry.
Oh, good day, sir.

352
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:21,918
Oh. It's turning the eggs.

353
00:27:24,703 --> 00:27:26,972
Oh, God.
Oh, perfect timing.

354
00:27:27,102 --> 00:27:29,338
I'd hoped they'd hatch
before I had to go to the boat.

355
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:31,804
Henry, Henry, Henry,
why didn't you tell me?

356
00:27:31,934 --> 00:27:35,545
I insist on being here
when they're born.

357
00:27:35,677 --> 00:27:39,953
Come on, come on.

358
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:43,321
Come on, little one.

359
00:27:43,452 --> 00:27:45,427
Come on.

360
00:27:45,596 --> 00:27:49,589
Come on, little one, come on.
Come on, then.

361
00:27:49,787 --> 00:27:52,121
Come on, then.

362
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:55,730
Very good.
Push, push!

363
00:27:55,867 --> 00:27:58,103
Very good!
Oh, God.

364
00:27:58,234 --> 00:28:01,049
Push, come on!

365
00:28:01,178 --> 00:28:03,992
Come on, then.
Come on, then.

366
00:28:04,121 --> 00:28:06,870
There you are.
There you are.

367
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,710
There.

368
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,768
They imprint on the first
creature they come in contact with.

369
00:28:14,904 --> 00:28:18,035
That's it!
Helps them to trust me.

370
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,752
I've been present
for the birth...

371
00:28:20,951 --> 00:28:23,089
of every little creature
on this island.

372
00:28:23,255 --> 00:28:26,516
Well, surely not the ones
that have bred in the wilds.

373
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:29,459
Yes. Actually, they
can't breed in the wild.

374
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:32,437
Population control is one
of our security precautions.

375
00:28:32,565 --> 00:28:35,980
There's no unauthorized
breeding in Jurassic Park.

376
00:28:36,117 --> 00:28:38,451
How do you know
they can't breed?

377
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,896
Well, because all the animals
in Jurassic Park are female.

378
00:28:42,036 --> 00:28:45,167
Oh. We've engineered them that way.

379
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:48,266
There you are.

380
00:28:48,403 --> 00:28:51,534
Oh, my God!
Look at that.

381
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:55,211
Blood temperature seems like
about high 80's maybe.

382
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:57,352
Wu?
Uh, 91.

383
00:28:57,554 --> 00:29:00,554
Homeothermic? It holds that
temperature? Mm-hmm, yeah.

384
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:02,478
That's incredible.

385
00:29:03,793 --> 00:29:05,484
Ooh.

386
00:29:05,617 --> 00:29:08,584
But, um, again, how do you
know they're all female?

387
00:29:08,721 --> 00:29:12,233
What, does somebody go out in the
park and pull up the dinosaurs' skirts?

388
00:29:12,369 --> 00:29:15,751
We control their chromosomes.
It's really not that difficult.

389
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:18,375
All vertebrate embryos are
inherently female anyway.

390
00:29:18,511 --> 00:29:21,991
They require an extra hormone given at the
right developmental stage to make them male.

391
00:29:22,126 --> 00:29:23,915
We simply
deny them that.

392
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:26,925
Deny them that?
John, the kind of control...

393
00:29:27,054 --> 00:29:29,705
you're attempting is, uh,
it's not possible.

394
00:29:29,838 --> 00:29:32,172
If there's one thing the history
of evolution has taught us,

395
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:34,121
it's that life
will not be contained.

396
00:29:34,253 --> 00:29:36,522
Life breaks free,
it expands to new territories...

397
00:29:36,653 --> 00:29:39,751
and crashes through barriers
painfully, maybe even dangerously,

398
00:29:39,884 --> 00:29:43,397
but, uh,
well, there it is.

399
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,598
There it is.

400
00:29:46,731 --> 00:29:50,887
You're implying that a group composed
entirely of female animals will breed?

401
00:29:51,018 --> 00:29:55,939
No, I'm simply saying that life,
uh, finds a way.

402
00:30:02,185 --> 00:30:04,868
What species is this?

403
00:30:05,001 --> 00:30:07,652
Uh... it's a velociraptor.

404
00:30:10,632 --> 00:30:12,487
You bred raptors?

405
00:30:25,446 --> 00:30:27,650
Dr. Grant, as I was saying,

406
00:30:27,845 --> 00:30:31,041
we laid on lunch for you before
you set out into the park.

407
00:30:31,174 --> 00:30:34,948
Our gourmet chef, Alejandro
- Oh. What are they doing?

408
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:40,765
Feeding them.

409
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:50,844
Alejandro's, uh, prepared a delightful
menu for us: Chilean sea bass, I believe.

410
00:30:50,979 --> 00:30:53,630
Uh, shall we?

411
00:31:30,845 --> 00:31:32,754
They should all
be destroyed.

412
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:35,772
Robert. Robert Muldoon,
my game warden from Kenya.

413
00:31:35,965 --> 00:31:38,746
Bit of an alarmist, I'm afraid, but
knows more about raptors than anyone.

414
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,623
What kind of metabolism do they
have? What's their growth rate?

415
00:31:41,755 --> 00:31:44,505
They're lethal at eight
months, and I do mean lethal.

416
00:31:44,635 --> 00:31:47,220
I've hunted most things that can hunt
you, but the way these things move-

417
00:31:47,356 --> 00:31:49,460
Fast for a biped?
Cheetah speed.

418
00:31:49,595 --> 00:31:53,685
Fifty, sixty miles per hour, if they ever got
out in the open. And they're astonishing jumpers.

419
00:31:53,819 --> 00:31:56,818
Yes, yes, yes, yes. That's why
we're taking extreme precautions.

420
00:31:56,954 --> 00:31:59,823
The viewing area set down below
here... Do they show intelligence?

421
00:31:59,961 --> 00:32:02,416
With their brain cavities, we assumed that
- They're extremely intelligent.

422
00:32:02,585 --> 00:32:06,774
Even problem-solving intelligence;
especially the big one.

423
00:32:06,905 --> 00:32:09,654
We bred eight originally,
but she took over the pride...

424
00:32:09,784 --> 00:32:12,370
and killed all
but two of the others.

425
00:32:12,504 --> 00:32:15,253
That one, when she
looks at you,

426
00:32:15,384 --> 00:32:18,001
you can see
she's working things out.

427
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:20,753
That's why we have
to feed 'em like this.

428
00:32:20,887 --> 00:32:23,308
She had them all attacking the
fences when the feeders came.

429
00:32:23,446 --> 00:32:25,813
The fences are electrified,
though, right?

430
00:32:25,942 --> 00:32:29,106
That's right, but they never
attack the same place twice.

431
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:33,809
They were testing the fences
for weaknesses systematically.

432
00:32:33,941 --> 00:32:37,585
They remember.

433
00:32:46,291 --> 00:32:49,008
Yes. Well.
Who's hungry?

434
00:32:49,139 --> 00:32:51,986
More adventurous guests...

435
00:32:52,115 --> 00:32:54,864
can opt for ourjungle river cruise or for a
close-up look at our majestic winged dinosaurs-

436
00:32:54,994 --> 00:32:57,034
None of these attractions
are ready yet,

437
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:00,847
but the park will open with the
basic tour you're about to take.

438
00:33:00,977 --> 00:33:03,824
Other rides will come on-line
six or twelve months after that.

439
00:33:03,952 --> 00:33:07,051
Absolutely spectacular designs.
Spared no expense.

440
00:33:07,248 --> 00:33:11,917
And we can charge anything we want: 2,000
a day, 10,000 a day. And people will pay it.

441
00:33:12,048 --> 00:33:15,146
Then there's the merchandise. I can personally advise
- Donald. Donald.

442
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:18,475
This park was not built to cater
only for the super rich.

443
00:33:18,575 --> 00:33:22,764
Everyone in the world has the right to
enjoy these animals. Sure. They will.

444
00:33:22,895 --> 00:33:26,789
What, we'll have, uh,
a coupon day or something.

445
00:33:29,614 --> 00:33:33,388
Gee, the lack of humility before
nature that's being displayed here,

446
00:33:33,517 --> 00:33:35,621
um... staggers me.

447
00:33:35,757 --> 00:33:38,604
Well, thank you, Dr. Malcolm, but I
think things are a little bit different...

448
00:33:38,764 --> 00:33:40,771
than you and I feared.
Yeah. They're a lot worse.

449
00:33:40,972 --> 00:33:43,787
Now wait a second. We haven't
even seen the park yet,

450
00:33:43,979 --> 00:33:46,662
and you
- No, Donald, Donald. Donald, let him talk.

451
00:33:46,795 --> 00:33:49,642
I want to hear every
viewpoint. I really do.

452
00:33:49,771 --> 00:33:54,440
Yeah. Don't you see the danger, uh,John,
inherent in what you're doing here?

453
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:57,156
Genetic power's the most awesome
force the planet's ever seen,

454
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:59,908
but you wield it like a kid
that's found his dad's gun.

455
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:03,008
- It's hardly appropriate to start
hurling generalizations- - If I may.

456
00:34:03,145 --> 00:34:06,592
Um, I'll tell you the problem with the
scientific power that you're using here.

457
00:34:06,729 --> 00:34:10,557
Uh, it didn't require
any discipline to attain it.

458
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,305
You know, you read what others had
done and you took the next step.

459
00:34:14,503 --> 00:34:17,918
You didn't earn the knowledge for yourselves,
so you don't take any responsibility...

460
00:34:18,087 --> 00:34:19,909
for it.

461
00:34:20,007 --> 00:34:23,868
You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to
accomplish something as fast as you could,

462
00:34:24,006 --> 00:34:25,981
and before you even
knew what you had,

463
00:34:26,118 --> 00:34:29,565
you patented it, packaged it and
slapped it on a plastic lunch box.

464
00:34:29,733 --> 00:34:32,864
And now you're selling it.
You wanna sell it. Well-

465
00:34:32,997 --> 00:34:35,615
I, I don't think you're
giving us our due credit.

466
00:34:35,748 --> 00:34:38,912
Our scientists have done things
which nobody's ever done before.

467
00:34:39,044 --> 00:34:41,793
Your scientists were so preoccupied
with whether or not they could,

468
00:34:41,923 --> 00:34:44,738
they didn't stop
to think if they should.

469
00:34:44,867 --> 00:34:47,682
Condors. Condors are
on the verge of extinction.

470
00:34:47,811 --> 00:34:49,666
No! If I was to
- No, no.

471
00:34:49,858 --> 00:34:53,207
If I was to create a flock of condors,
you wouldn't have anything to say.

472
00:34:53,346 --> 00:34:57,088
Hold on. This isn't some species that
was obliterated by deforestation...

473
00:34:57,217 --> 00:34:59,289
or the building
of a dam.

474
00:34:59,457 --> 00:35:01,726
Dinosaurs, uh, uh,
had their shot,

475
00:35:01,857 --> 00:35:05,469
and nature selected them
for extinction.

476
00:35:05,601 --> 00:35:09,975
I simply don't understand this Luddite
attitude, especially from a scientist.

477
00:35:10,112 --> 00:35:14,781
I mean, how can we stand in the
light of discovery and not act?

478
00:35:14,975 --> 00:35:17,364
Oh, what's so great about
discovery? It's a violent,

479
00:35:17,567 --> 00:35:20,120
penetrative act
that scars what it explores.

480
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:22,621
What you call
discovery...

481
00:35:22,782 --> 00:35:25,237
I call the rape
of the natural world.

482
00:35:25,374 --> 00:35:27,348
Well, the question is:

483
00:35:27,485 --> 00:35:30,332
How can you know anything
about an extinct ecosystem?

484
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:33,144
And therefore, how could you ever
assume that you can control it?

485
00:35:33,277 --> 00:35:35,862
You have plants in this
building that are poisonous.

486
00:35:35,997 --> 00:35:37,938
You picked them
because they look good;

487
00:35:38,076 --> 00:35:41,076
but these are aggressive living things
that have no idea what century they're in,

488
00:35:41,212 --> 00:35:44,245
and they'll defend themselves,
violently, if necessary.

489
00:35:46,907 --> 00:35:49,754
Dr. Grant, if there's
one person here...

490
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:53,263
who could appreciate
what I'm trying to do-

491
00:35:53,466 --> 00:35:58,287
The world has just changed so radically,
and we're all running to catch up.

492
00:35:58,425 --> 00:36:01,808
I don't want to jump to
any conclusions, but look,

493
00:36:01,945 --> 00:36:06,930
dinosaurs and man, two species separated
by 65 million years of evolution,

494
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:10,293
have just been suddenly thrown
back into the mix together.

495
00:36:10,423 --> 00:36:15,060
How can we possibly have the
slightest idea of what to expect?

496
00:36:15,191 --> 00:36:18,257
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.

497
00:36:18,423 --> 00:36:20,975
You're meant to defend me
against these characters,

498
00:36:21,175 --> 00:36:24,273
and the only one I've got on my
side is the bloodsucking lawyer.

499
00:36:24,406 --> 00:36:26,675
Thank you.

500
00:36:31,636 --> 00:36:34,603
Well. They're here.

501
00:36:34,932 --> 00:36:38,030
You four are gonna have a spot
of company out in the park.

502
00:36:38,164 --> 00:36:40,814
Spend a little time
with our target audience.

503
00:36:40,947 --> 00:36:43,630
- Grandpa!
- Kids!

504
00:36:46,451 --> 00:36:49,232
Wait! Careful with the
old man. We miss you.

505
00:36:49,363 --> 00:36:52,112
Thanks for the presents. We loved
the presents. They were great.

506
00:36:52,274 --> 00:36:54,161
Did you enjoy
the helicopter?

507
00:36:54,354 --> 00:36:56,655
Yeah! It went down,
and we all went right up.

508
00:36:59,121 --> 00:37:03,114
Now, kids, come away.
Not too close to the cars.

509
00:37:03,249 --> 00:37:06,696
Aren't they lovely?
Aren't they glorious?

510
00:37:06,832 --> 00:37:09,581
These will be your
transports for the afternoon.

511
00:37:09,712 --> 00:37:11,981
No drivers.
No, no, no, no. No drivers.

512
00:37:12,111 --> 00:37:15,177
They're electric. They run on this
track in the middle of the roadway.

513
00:37:15,311 --> 00:37:18,093
Totally non-polluting. Top of
the line. Spared no expense.

514
00:37:18,222 --> 00:37:20,589
It's an interactive
CD-ROM! Look!

515
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:23,979
You just touch the screen and
it talks about whatever you want.

516
00:37:24,142 --> 00:37:26,116
Lex, darling, you're
all right in there.

517
00:37:26,317 --> 00:37:28,651
Dr. Sattler, come with me. Dr.
Grant, come in the second car.

518
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:31,563
I'm gonna ride with,
uh, Dr. Sattler.

519
00:37:42,412 --> 00:37:44,451
I read your book.

520
00:37:44,587 --> 00:37:46,594
Well, that's...
that's great.

521
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:51,105
Do you really think that dinosaurs turned
into birds and that's where they all went?

522
00:37:51,242 --> 00:37:55,682
Well, a few species may have
evolved along those lines.

523
00:38:00,137 --> 00:38:03,585
They sure don't look
like birds to me.

524
00:38:03,721 --> 00:38:06,535
I heard that there's
this, um, meteor,

525
00:38:06,664 --> 00:38:10,886
hit the earth someplace in
Mexico and made this big crater?

526
00:38:11,015 --> 00:38:13,982
Listen, uh-
Tim.

527
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:17,915
Tim, which car
were you planning on?

528
00:38:18,023 --> 00:38:20,805
Whichever one you are.

529
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:24,835
Then I heard about
this thing in Omni...

530
00:38:24,998 --> 00:38:27,747
about this, um, meteor
making all this heat.

531
00:38:27,909 --> 00:38:31,706
And it made diamond dust. That changed the
weather, and they died because of the weather.

532
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:34,756
Then my teacher tells me about this
book by a guy named Bakker. He says-

533
00:38:37,828 --> 00:38:41,886
She said I should ride with you
because it'd be good for you.

534
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,929
The boat is now loading.

535
00:38:44,067 --> 00:38:48,322
Everyone must be on the dock
for the 1900-hour departure.

536
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:49,465
National Weather Service is
tracking a tropical storm...

537
00:38:49,538 --> 00:38:51,611
National Weather Service is
tracking a tropical storm...

538
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:54,015
about 75 miles
west of us.

539
00:38:54,146 --> 00:38:56,731
Aye-yi-yi-yi. Why didn't
I build in Orlando?

540
00:38:56,897 --> 00:39:01,915
I'll keep an eye on it. Maybe it'll
spring south like the last one.

541
00:39:03,073 --> 00:39:06,301
Ray, start
the tour program.

542
00:39:15,135 --> 00:39:17,884
Hold onto your butts.

543
00:39:24,573 --> 00:39:29,559
And why did they
put the fiberglass thing?

544
00:39:29,725 --> 00:39:31,612
I know.

545
00:39:31,804 --> 00:39:34,870
What kind of dinosaurs
are we gonna see now?

546
00:39:35,036 --> 00:39:38,418
Hey, lookit! A ghost, a ghost!
Aah! Oh, no. It's driving.

547
00:39:38,588 --> 00:39:41,337
Turn in your fear at the door
and join the future, right?

548
00:39:41,467 --> 00:39:44,314
Oh, God help us. We're
in the hands of engineers.

549
00:39:44,443 --> 00:39:46,963
During most of your tour,
the appropriate information...

550
00:39:47,098 --> 00:39:49,781
will be automatically selected
and displayed for you.

551
00:39:49,914 --> 00:39:52,467
Hey, look! Simply touch the
area of the screen displaying...

552
00:39:52,602 --> 00:39:54,511
the appropriate icon.
Are we gonna hit that?

553
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:57,399
Welcome to Jurassic Park.

554
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,058
What have they got
in there, King Kong?

555
00:40:15,351 --> 00:40:18,449
The voice you're now hearing
is Richard Kiley.

556
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,364
We spared no expense.
If you look to the right,

557
00:40:21,494 --> 00:40:26,993
you will see a herd of the first dinosaurs
on our tour, called Dilophosaurus.

558
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:29,329
- Dilophosaurus!
- Oh, shit!

559
00:40:29,461 --> 00:40:31,403
One of the earliest carnivores,

560
00:40:31,604 --> 00:40:34,386
we now know Dilophosaurus
is actually poisonous,

561
00:40:34,516 --> 00:40:38,858
spitting its venom at its prey, causing
blindness and eventually paralysis,

562
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,710
allowing the carnivore
to eat at its leisure.

563
00:40:41,843 --> 00:40:44,298
I can't see.
This makes Dilophosaurus...

564
00:40:44,435 --> 00:40:46,857
a beautiful
but deadly addition...

565
00:40:46,995 --> 00:40:50,638
to Jurassic Park.

566
00:40:55,601 --> 00:40:58,862
Alan... where?

567
00:41:01,553 --> 00:41:03,691
Damn.

568
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:10,985
Vehicle headlights are on
and they're not responding.

569
00:41:11,152 --> 00:41:15,406
Those shouldn't be running off the car
batteries. Item 151 on today's glitch list.

570
00:41:15,566 --> 00:41:18,730
We have all the problems of a
major theme park and a major zoo,

571
00:41:18,862 --> 00:41:21,764
and the computers aren't
even on their feet yet.

572
00:41:21,902 --> 00:41:26,887
Dennis, our lives are in your
hands, and you have butterfingers?

573
00:41:27,021 --> 00:41:30,731
I'm totally unappreciated
in my time.

574
00:41:30,861 --> 00:41:34,570
You can run this park from this room
with minimal staff for up to three days.

575
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:38,529
You think that kind of
automation is easy? Or cheap?

576
00:41:38,732 --> 00:41:41,481
You know anybody who can network
eight Connection Machines...

577
00:41:41,611 --> 00:41:44,361
and debug two million lines of
code for what I bid for this job?

578
00:41:44,491 --> 00:41:46,760
If you can, I'd love to
see him try. I'm sorry...

579
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:49,639
about your financial problems,
but they are your problems.

580
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:52,355
Oh, you're right, you're absolutely
right. Everything's my problem.

581
00:41:52,489 --> 00:41:56,067
I will not get drawn into another
financial debate with you, Dennis.

582
00:41:56,201 --> 00:41:59,016
I really will not. There's
been hardly any debate at all.

583
00:41:59,145 --> 00:42:02,276
I don't blame people
for their mistakes,

584
00:42:02,408 --> 00:42:05,125
but I do ask
that they pay for them.

585
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:07,263
Thanks, Dad.
Dennis!

586
00:42:07,432 --> 00:42:09,319
The headlights.

587
00:42:09,479 --> 00:42:12,130
Yeah. I'll debug the tour
program when they get back, okay?

588
00:42:12,295 --> 00:42:15,556
Okay? It'll eat a lot of compute cycles.
We'll lose part of the system for a while.

589
00:42:15,751 --> 00:42:17,539
There's a finite amount
of memory.

590
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:22,339
You gonna compile for half an hour,
for crying out loud? Quiet! All of you!

591
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:24,804
They're approaching
the tyrannosaur paddock.

592
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:17,174
God creates dinosaurs.
God destroys dinosaurs.

593
00:43:17,374 --> 00:43:21,913
God creates man. Man destroys
God. Man creates dinosaurs.

594
00:43:23,229 --> 00:43:25,367
Dinosaurs...

595
00:43:25,501 --> 00:43:27,922
eat man.

596
00:43:28,061 --> 00:43:31,377
Woman inherits the Earth.

597
00:43:37,371 --> 00:43:40,666
We'll try to tempt the Rex now.
Keep watching the fence.

598
00:43:49,466 --> 00:43:51,735
What's gonna happen
to the goat?

599
00:43:55,321 --> 00:43:59,630
He's gonna eat the goat? Excellent.

600
00:43:59,768 --> 00:44:03,827
What's the matter, kid?
You never had lamb chops?

601
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,058
I happen to be
a vegetarian.

602
00:44:13,975 --> 00:44:18,164
T
- Rex doesn't want to be fed. He wants to hunt.

603
00:44:18,294 --> 00:44:23,181
Can't just suppress 65
million years of gut instinct.

604
00:44:43,762 --> 00:44:46,631
Uh, uh, now, eventually you
do plan to have dinosaurs...

605
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:49,585
on your, on your
dinosaur tour, right?

606
00:44:49,713 --> 00:44:52,582
Hello? H-Hello.

607
00:44:52,786 --> 00:44:55,087
Yes?

608
00:44:55,217 --> 00:44:57,638
I really hate that man.

609
00:45:01,968 --> 00:45:06,343
See, the tyrannosaur, uh, uh, doesn't obey
any set patterns or, or park schedules.

610
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,967
The essence, uh,
of chaos.

611
00:45:09,104 --> 00:45:12,332
Um, I'm still not clear on
chaos. Wh-What does that mean?

612
00:45:12,463 --> 00:45:17,132
Oh, oh, it simply deals with, uh,
unpredictability in complex systems.

613
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:20,291
The shorthand is
the, the Butterfly Effect.

614
00:45:20,493 --> 00:45:22,795
A butterfly can flap
its wings in Peking,

615
00:45:22,925 --> 00:45:25,674
and in Central Park you get
rain instead of sunshine.

616
00:45:27,693 --> 00:45:30,410
I go too fast. I did
a fly-by. I missed it.

617
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:33,289
Give me that glass of water. We're
going to conduct an experiment.

618
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:36,267
It should be still. The car's
bouncin' up and down, but that's okay.

619
00:45:36,395 --> 00:45:39,078
Now, put your hand flat
like a hieroglyphic.

620
00:45:39,211 --> 00:45:41,699
Say a drop of water
falls on your hand.

621
00:45:41,835 --> 00:45:44,802
Which way is the drop going
to fall off? Which finger?

622
00:45:44,938 --> 00:45:47,720
Thumb, I'd say.

623
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:50,599
Aha. Okay. Now freeze
your hand. Don't move.

624
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:53,632
I'm going to do the same thing,
start with the same place again.

625
00:45:53,801 --> 00:45:56,670
Which way is it going to roll
off? Let's say back, the same way.

626
00:45:56,873 --> 00:45:58,760
S- Same way.
Back the same way.

627
00:45:58,953 --> 00:46:01,221
It changed.

628
00:46:01,352 --> 00:46:04,929
It changed. Why?
Because tiny variations:

629
00:46:05,064 --> 00:46:08,576
uh, the orientation of the hairs on
your hands, Hey, Alan, look at this.

630
00:46:08,711 --> 00:46:11,940
um, the amount of blood distending
your vessels, imperfections in the skin-

631
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:15,299
Imperfections in the skin? Oh,
just... microscopic. Microscopic.

632
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:18,114
And never repeat and
vastly affect the outcome.

633
00:46:18,246 --> 00:46:20,547
That's... what?
Unpredictability.

634
00:46:20,678 --> 00:46:23,198
Right.

635
00:46:23,333 --> 00:46:25,569
There.
Look at this. See?

636
00:46:25,733 --> 00:46:28,733
I'm right again. Nobody could've
predicted that Dr. Grant would suddenly,

637
00:46:28,932 --> 00:46:32,095
suddenly jump out of
a moving vehicle. Alan?

638
00:46:32,228 --> 00:46:35,075
Alan! There's, uh, another example.

639
00:46:35,236 --> 00:46:39,164
See, here I'm now by myself,
uh, er, talking to myself.

640
00:46:39,299 --> 00:46:41,665
That's, that's
chaos theory.

641
00:46:41,795 --> 00:46:45,023
Stop the program.
Stop the program.

642
00:46:46,402 --> 00:46:48,922
I told you how many times...

643
00:46:49,058 --> 00:46:51,643
we needed locking mechanisms
on the vehicle doors?

644
00:46:51,777 --> 00:46:53,882
Stopping park vehicles
and rebooting program.

645
00:46:54,017 --> 00:46:57,148
We're on.
Will notify for resume.

646
00:46:57,313 --> 00:47:00,411
I'll switch it
over to TelePromp Ter.

647
00:47:00,576 --> 00:47:02,332
What about the circuit
integrities?

648
00:47:02,464 --> 00:47:04,831
Screen says faulty sensor.

649
00:47:04,992 --> 00:47:06,999
I'll call security.

650
00:47:07,135 --> 00:47:09,720
We're a full go on that.
Looks good.

651
00:47:09,854 --> 00:47:13,432
Like I was saying, there's this
other book by a guy named Bakker,

652
00:47:13,566 --> 00:47:16,381
- and he says the dinosaurs died of a bunch of diseases.
- Where are we going?

653
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:18,299
You see something?

654
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:21,147
Is there anybody else who thinks
we shouldn't be out here?

655
00:47:21,277 --> 00:47:24,179
His book was a lot fatter
than yours was. Really?

656
00:47:24,317 --> 00:47:27,000
Yours was fully illustrated, honey. Hey.

657
00:47:27,165 --> 00:47:28,855
You okay?

658
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:31,737
Hey, look at this.
Wait. Hey, watch.

659
00:47:31,868 --> 00:47:35,184
Hey, come on.
Watch this.

660
00:47:35,387 --> 00:47:39,097
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

661
00:47:39,227 --> 00:47:42,129
Everybody stay here.

662
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:49,973
Timmy!
Hey, Timmy-

663
00:47:55,129 --> 00:47:57,878
Oh, wow.

664
00:47:58,008 --> 00:48:00,212
Okay?
Of course.

665
00:48:02,616 --> 00:48:06,609
Don't be scared. It's okay.
Muldoon tranquilized her for me.

666
00:48:06,775 --> 00:48:08,979
She's sick.

667
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:17,492
Oh, my God.

668
00:48:21,109 --> 00:48:21,775
Hey! Hey, baby.

669
00:48:32,436 --> 00:48:34,323
Hey, baby girl.

670
00:48:34,483 --> 00:48:36,872
Yeah.

671
00:48:39,251 --> 00:48:41,672
She was my favorite
when I was a kid.

672
00:48:41,843 --> 00:48:45,519
Now I see her, she's the most
beautiful thing I ever saw.

673
00:48:49,041 --> 00:48:51,823
It's okay.

674
00:48:53,745 --> 00:48:56,843
Microvesicles.
That's interesting.

675
00:48:58,096 --> 00:49:00,779
Thanks.
What are her symptoms?

676
00:49:00,912 --> 00:49:03,661
Oh, imbalance, disorientation,
labored breathing. Right.

677
00:49:03,823 --> 00:49:06,856
It seems to happen about every
six weeks or so. Six weeks.

678
00:49:20,013 --> 00:49:22,664
These are dilated.
Take a look. They are?

679
00:49:22,797 --> 00:49:24,804
It's okay.
I'll be damned.

680
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:29,446
That's pharmacological.
From local plant life.

681
00:49:35,979 --> 00:49:38,400
Is this West Indian lilac?

682
00:49:38,571 --> 00:49:43,273
Yes. We know they're toxic,
but the animals don't eat 'em.

683
00:49:46,282 --> 00:49:48,998
Are you sure?
Pretty sure.

684
00:49:50,409 --> 00:49:53,256
There's only one way
to be positive.

685
00:49:53,384 --> 00:49:56,548
I'd have to see
the dinosaur's droppings.

686
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:00,574
Dino... droppings, droppings? Yeah.

687
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:07,745
Yep. Yep.
Yeah, I got that.

688
00:50:07,911 --> 00:50:10,780
That storm center hasn't
dissipated or changed course.

689
00:50:10,982 --> 00:50:13,732
We're gonna have to cut
the tour short, I'm afraid.

690
00:50:13,862 --> 00:50:16,928
Pick it up again tomorrow where we
left off. Are you sure we have to?

691
00:50:17,062 --> 00:50:19,167
It's not worth taking the chance. Well-

692
00:50:19,301 --> 00:50:22,148
Sustained winds, 45 knots. Tell
them when they get back in the cars.

693
00:50:22,277 --> 00:50:25,027
Ladies and gentlemen, last
shuttle leaving for the dock...

694
00:50:25,157 --> 00:50:27,164
leaves in approximately
five minutes.

695
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:30,049
Drop what you're doing
and leave now.

696
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:33,081
Damn!

697
00:50:40,099 --> 00:50:42,848
That is
one big pile of shit.

698
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:51,773
You're right. There's no
trace of lilac berries.

699
00:50:51,905 --> 00:50:53,912
That's so odd,
though.

700
00:50:54,049 --> 00:50:58,718
All right, so she's suffering
from Melia toxicity...

701
00:50:58,848 --> 00:51:01,598
every six weeks.

702
00:51:02,847 --> 00:51:07,037
Let's see.
Rats. Nada.

703
00:51:07,167 --> 00:51:10,549
Every six weeks. She's, um... tenacious.

704
00:51:10,686 --> 00:51:14,428
You have no idea.

705
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:18,332
You will remember to wash your
hands before you eat anything?

706
00:51:29,756 --> 00:51:34,228
Doctors, if you please, I have
to insist that we get moving.

707
00:51:34,364 --> 00:51:36,632
You know,
if it's all right,

708
00:51:36,763 --> 00:51:39,697
I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding
and finish up with the trike.

709
00:51:39,834 --> 00:51:41,841
Sure. I'm in
a gas-powered jeep.

710
00:51:41,978 --> 00:51:45,523
I can drop her off at the visitor's
center before I make the boat.

711
00:51:45,689 --> 00:51:47,576
Then I'll
catch up with you.

712
00:51:47,769 --> 00:51:50,638
You sure? Yeah. I wanna stay
with her a little longer.

713
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:53,077
Okay, then.
Okay.

714
00:51:53,209 --> 00:51:56,176
Now!

715
00:52:06,871 --> 00:52:11,245
There's nothing I can do. The
captain says we gotta go, we gotta go!

716
00:52:11,382 --> 00:52:14,830
You gotta give me the time. I did a test
run on this thing. It took me twenty minutes.

717
00:52:14,966 --> 00:52:18,642
I could maybe push it to eighteen, but
you gotta give me at least fifteen minutes.

718
00:52:18,805 --> 00:52:21,555
No promises!

719
00:52:27,284 --> 00:52:31,310
Visitor vehicles are
returning to the garage.

720
00:52:31,444 --> 00:52:34,029
So much for our first tour.

721
00:52:34,163 --> 00:52:37,872
Two no-shows
and one sick triceratops.

722
00:52:38,003 --> 00:52:41,712
It could've been worse,
John. A lot worse.

723
00:52:41,842 --> 00:52:43,751
Anybody want a soda
or something?

724
00:52:43,889 --> 00:52:48,166
I'm going to the machine. I thought, you
know, maybe I'd get somebody something.

725
00:52:48,337 --> 00:52:50,857
I've had only sweets, and
I'm gonna get something salty.

726
00:52:51,057 --> 00:52:53,326
I thought maybe
somebody would, uh-

727
00:52:53,425 --> 00:52:58,574
Oh, I finished debugging the phones. I was gonna debu
- So I did.

728
00:52:58,704 --> 00:53:01,289
You told me to, uh,
so I debugged the phones.

729
00:53:01,423 --> 00:53:04,325
I should tell you the system
is gonna be compiling...

730
00:53:04,463 --> 00:53:06,405
for, uh, eighteen
to twenty minutes.

731
00:53:06,543 --> 00:53:09,444
Some of the minor systems might go on
or off, but it's nothing to worry about.

732
00:53:09,583 --> 00:53:11,524
It's a simple thing.

733
00:53:31,019 --> 00:53:35,394
You got any kids? Me?
Oh, oh, hell, yeah, three.

734
00:53:35,531 --> 00:53:38,149
I love kids.
Hmm.

735
00:53:38,283 --> 00:53:41,097
Anything at all
can and does happen.

736
00:53:41,226 --> 00:53:44,837
Same with wives, for
that matter. You married?

737
00:53:44,969 --> 00:53:48,831
Occasionally.
Uh, yeah,

738
00:53:48,969 --> 00:53:53,224
I'm always on the lookout
for a future ex-Mrs. Malcolm.

739
00:54:04,871 --> 00:54:10,085
Five, four, three,
two, one.

740
00:54:17,861 --> 00:54:19,649
That's odd.

741
00:54:19,781 --> 00:54:23,871
What? Door security
systems are shutting down.

742
00:54:24,036 --> 00:54:27,451
Well, Nedry said a few systems
would go off-line, didn't he?

743
00:55:20,989 --> 00:55:26,138
By the way, Dr. Sattler, um,
she's not, like, available, is she?

744
00:55:26,268 --> 00:55:30,904
Why?
Yeah, I'm sorry.

745
00:55:31,067 --> 00:55:33,555
You two are, uh-
Yeah.

746
00:55:33,755 --> 00:55:36,853
Hey, what'd I touch?

747
00:55:36,955 --> 00:55:39,475
Uh, you didn't touch
anything. We stopped.

748
00:55:46,905 --> 00:55:49,775
Whoa, whoa. What the
hell? What the hell?

749
00:55:49,913 --> 00:55:52,879
What now? Fences are
failing all over the park.

750
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:54,926
Find Nedry!
Check the vending machines.

751
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:28,977
Look at this workstation.
What a complete slob.

752
00:56:29,107 --> 00:56:32,041
The raptor fences
aren't out, are they?

753
00:56:36,371 --> 00:56:39,502
No, no.
They're still on.

754
00:56:41,329 --> 00:56:44,264
Why the hell would he
turn the other ones off?

755
00:57:22,797 --> 00:57:26,757
Access main program.
Access main security.

756
00:57:26,892 --> 00:57:28,801
Access main program grid.

757
00:57:36,427 --> 00:57:39,906
Uh, uh, uh!
You didn't say the magic word.

758
00:57:40,106 --> 00:57:42,440
Uh, uh, uh! Uh, uh,
uh! Please! Goddamn it!

759
00:57:42,602 --> 00:57:47,423
I hate this hacker crap! Call
Nedry's people in Cambridge.

760
00:57:47,561 --> 00:57:51,389
Uh, uh, uh!
Phones are out too.

761
00:57:51,528 --> 00:57:55,838
Uh, uh, uh! Where did the vehicles stop?

762
00:58:16,005 --> 00:58:19,168
Their radio's out too.
Gennaro said to stay put.

763
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:21,667
Kids okay? I didn't ask.
Why wouldn't they be?

764
00:58:21,764 --> 00:58:24,185
Kids get scared. What's
to be scared about?

765
00:58:24,324 --> 00:58:27,139
It's just a little hiccup in the
power. I didn't say I was scared.

766
00:58:27,267 --> 00:58:29,984
I didn't say you were scared. I know.

767
00:58:30,115 --> 00:58:32,504
Boo!

768
00:58:32,643 --> 00:58:36,537
Hey, where did you find
those? Under my seat.

769
00:58:36,674 --> 00:58:38,845
Are they heavy?
Yeah!

770
00:58:38,978 --> 00:58:41,825
Then they're expensive.
Put 'em back.

771
00:58:47,521 --> 00:58:49,888
Don't scare me.

772
00:58:58,911 --> 00:59:02,424
Oh, cool. Night vision.

773
00:59:24,284 --> 00:59:26,967
Do you feel that?

774
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:02,869
Maybe it's the power
tryin' to come back on.

775
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:07,155
What is that?

776
01:00:20,052 --> 01:00:22,954
Where's the goat?

777
01:00:44,977 --> 01:00:47,279
Oh,Jesus!

778
01:00:51,697 --> 01:00:53,835
He left us. He left us.

779
01:01:03,886 --> 01:01:07,366
Where does he think
he's going?

780
01:01:07,502 --> 01:01:12,390
When you gotta go,
you gotta go.

781
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:27,492
Dr. Grant?

782
01:01:39,082 --> 01:01:42,049
Boy, do I hate
being right all the time.

783
01:01:50,536 --> 01:01:55,140
Keep absolutely still. Its
vision is based on movement.

784
01:02:08,262 --> 01:02:12,734
Turn the light off.
Turn the light off.

785
01:02:13,829 --> 01:02:16,131
Turn the light off!

786
01:03:09,437 --> 01:03:12,252
Turn- Turn it off!
I'm sorry!

787
01:03:12,381 --> 01:03:15,381
I'm sorry!

788
01:03:15,517 --> 01:03:17,721
You're the one
who turned it-

789
01:03:56,471 --> 01:03:58,675
No!

790
01:04:16,468 --> 01:04:21,388
Hey!

791
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:23,378
Oh, God.

792
01:04:30,835 --> 01:04:35,111
- Hey-hey! Hey-hey!
- Ian, freeze!

793
01:04:35,314 --> 01:04:39,088
Get the kids! Get rid of the flare!

794
01:04:39,282 --> 01:04:43,372
Get the kids! Get rid of the flare!

795
01:04:44,945 --> 01:04:48,556
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord be with me-

796
01:04:48,688 --> 01:04:51,273
Aaah!

797
01:05:03,630 --> 01:05:06,477
No! No! Aaah-

798
01:05:08,557 --> 01:05:13,161
Dr. Grant! Dr. Grant!
Okay, Lex, I got ya.

799
01:05:13,292 --> 01:05:17,034
I'm stuck!
The seat's got my feet!

800
01:05:17,196 --> 01:05:20,043
I'll get you next.
You're okay. Dad! Dad!

801
01:05:20,172 --> 01:05:24,710
You're all right.
Tim! Tim?

802
01:05:27,979 --> 01:05:30,662
Don't move. He can't see us
if we don't move.

803
01:06:06,406 --> 01:06:10,628
This way-
Wait, wait, wait!

804
01:06:10,821 --> 01:06:14,083
Timmy? Timmy!
Tim!

805
01:06:30,850 --> 01:06:35,323
Lex! Lex!
You're chokin' me!

806
01:06:37,665 --> 01:06:41,887
Grab the wire!

807
01:06:57,375 --> 01:07:01,498
"Keycheck space minus O, keychecks
off, safety space minus O."

808
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:05,274
He's turning the safety systems off. He doesn't
want anybody to see what he's about to do.

809
01:07:05,406 --> 01:07:08,155
Look at this next entry. It's the
kicker. "White rabbit object. "

810
01:07:08,285 --> 01:07:11,863
It did it all, but with the keychecks off,
the computer didn't file the keystrokes.

811
01:07:12,029 --> 01:07:15,476
The only way to find them is to go through
the computer's lines of code one by one.

812
01:07:15,676 --> 01:07:18,491
How many lines of code are
there? About two million.

813
01:07:18,652 --> 01:07:20,474
Two million?
Yeah.

814
01:07:23,131 --> 01:07:26,360
Robert, I, I wonder if perhaps
you would be good enough...

815
01:07:26,491 --> 01:07:31,062
to take a gas jeep and
bring back my grandchildren.

816
01:07:31,194 --> 01:07:33,944
Sure.

817
01:07:35,961 --> 01:07:39,277
I'm going with him.

818
01:07:39,417 --> 01:07:44,435
John. John?
The magic word, the magic word-

819
01:07:44,568 --> 01:07:47,251
Uh, uh, uh!

820
01:07:47,416 --> 01:07:51,158
I can't get Jurassic Park back
on-line without Dennis Nedry.

821
01:07:53,591 --> 01:07:56,111
Should have been there
by now.

822
01:07:57,527 --> 01:07:59,796
No damn good.

823
01:08:09,941 --> 01:08:12,559
Oh, damn!

824
01:08:17,684 --> 01:08:20,979
There's the road!

825
01:08:25,171 --> 01:08:29,807
Winch this sucker off the thing and then
I tie it to that thing there and then I...

826
01:08:29,938 --> 01:08:32,240
pull down this thing
here and I-

827
01:08:32,370 --> 01:08:36,647
Oh. Oh!

828
01:08:40,113 --> 01:08:44,074
My glasses!
I can afford more glasses.

829
01:08:57,327 --> 01:08:59,432
Oh, geez!

830
01:09:10,732 --> 01:09:13,732
You got time, you got time.
You can do it!

831
01:09:13,868 --> 01:09:16,388
You can do it.
Come on, Dennis!

832
01:09:20,843 --> 01:09:23,745
Hello?

833
01:09:26,187 --> 01:09:30,791
Ha! Yeah, yeah,
that's nice. Gotta go.

834
01:09:38,922 --> 01:09:43,743
Oh. Ah, nice boy.
Nice boy!

835
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:46,782
Nice dinosaur.

836
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:50,236
I thought you were one of your
big brothers. You're not so bad.

837
01:09:50,376 --> 01:09:53,375
What do you want? You
want food? Look at me.

838
01:09:53,543 --> 01:09:55,812
I just fell down a hill. I'm
soakin' wet. I don't have any food!

839
01:09:55,975 --> 01:09:59,171
I have no food on me.
I have nothing on me.

840
01:09:59,302 --> 01:10:03,164
Play fetch?
Play fetch?

841
01:10:03,302 --> 01:10:05,124
Look, see?
See stick?

842
01:10:05,253 --> 01:10:07,522
See stick?
Yeah, look, stick.

843
01:10:07,653 --> 01:10:11,875
Look, stick! Stick, stupid!
Fetch the stick, boy!

844
01:10:12,005 --> 01:10:13,859
You like the stick?

845
01:10:13,988 --> 01:10:17,468
No wonder you're extinct.

846
01:10:17,604 --> 01:10:19,644
I'm gonna run you over
when I come back down.

847
01:10:48,992 --> 01:10:50,847
Aaah!

848
01:10:50,975 --> 01:10:54,390
Aaah!

849
01:11:32,826 --> 01:11:35,346
Timmy? Timmy!

850
01:11:35,514 --> 01:11:37,750
Tim!

851
01:11:37,881 --> 01:11:42,834
Now, Lex, listen, listen
to me. I'm right here.

852
01:11:42,968 --> 01:11:45,651
I'm gonna look after you, but
I have to go help your brother.

853
01:11:45,784 --> 01:11:48,205
So I want you to stay
right here and wait for me!

854
01:11:48,344 --> 01:11:50,384
He left us.
He left us!

855
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:54,414
But that's not...
what I'm gonna do.

856
01:11:54,551 --> 01:11:57,812
Okay?

857
01:11:57,943 --> 01:12:01,804
Stay here.

858
01:12:07,094 --> 01:12:08,882
Timmy?

859
01:12:22,515 --> 01:12:27,784
Tim? You hear me?
I'm coming up.

860
01:12:27,922 --> 01:12:32,394
I hate climbing. I hate
trees. Way too high.

861
01:12:33,810 --> 01:12:36,908
Oh, goddamn tree.

862
01:12:37,073 --> 01:12:39,975
Hey, Tim?

863
01:12:43,313 --> 01:12:45,581
Tim?

864
01:12:52,623 --> 01:12:55,917
Tim.

865
01:12:59,406 --> 01:13:04,708
You okay? You okay? I threw up.

866
01:13:04,909 --> 01:13:08,204
Oh. Oh, that's okay.

867
01:13:09,804 --> 01:13:13,448
Just give me your hand.

868
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:16,962
Hey, Tim, I won't
tell anyone you threw up.

869
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:19,652
Just, just
give me your hand.

870
01:13:27,498 --> 01:13:32,069
Here, I gotcha. Come on. Okay.

871
01:13:32,202 --> 01:13:36,544
That's good. Over the wheel.
Don't pull me too hard.

872
01:13:36,713 --> 01:13:40,390
No hurry.

873
01:13:40,553 --> 01:13:42,462
Stand on the door.
Hang onto me.

874
01:13:42,664 --> 01:13:45,086
Okay, I got you.
Okay.

875
01:13:45,255 --> 01:13:48,768
Okay, that's not too bad,
right, Tim? Yes, it is.

876
01:13:48,903 --> 01:13:51,750
Just like coming out of a tree house.
Did your dad ever build you a tree house?

877
01:13:51,879 --> 01:13:54,464
No!
Yeah, me too.

878
01:13:54,599 --> 01:13:58,177
The thing about climbing is, you never,
never look down! This is impossible.

879
01:13:58,310 --> 01:14:00,960
How am I gonna do this? It's about
50, 50 feet- I'm gonna help you-

880
01:14:07,141 --> 01:14:09,312
Oh, no.
Tim, go!

881
01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:33,879
Oh! Go, go, go!
Go, Tim, go!

882
01:14:40,065 --> 01:14:43,447
Faster, Tim!

883
01:14:47,936 --> 01:14:50,521
Tim, jump!

884
01:14:52,671 --> 01:14:55,126
Go, Tim!

885
01:15:00,733 --> 01:15:05,173
Well... we're back...
in the car again.

886
01:15:05,309 --> 01:15:09,083
Well, at least
you're out of the tree.

887
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:17,776
Where's the other car?
Where's the other car!

888
01:15:18,651 --> 01:15:22,000
Alan!
Dr. Grant!

889
01:15:22,171 --> 01:15:25,585
Alan!

890
01:15:27,642 --> 01:15:30,489
Grant!

891
01:15:37,433 --> 01:15:41,655
I think this was Gennaro.
I think this was too.

892
01:15:41,784 --> 01:15:45,232
I think
it's ahead of us.

893
01:15:45,399 --> 01:15:49,174
It could be anywhere. With the fences down, it
can wander in and out of any paddock it likes.

894
01:15:56,694 --> 01:16:00,109
He put a tourniquet on.
Ian. Ian!

895
01:16:00,245 --> 01:16:03,114
Remind me to thank John
for a lovely weekend.

896
01:16:07,637 --> 01:16:10,124
Can we chance
moving him?

897
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:12,082
Please chance it.

898
01:16:17,843 --> 01:16:21,737
Ellie, come on!

899
01:16:21,939 --> 01:16:24,273
Wait, wait.

900
01:16:28,722 --> 01:16:31,177
The other car!

901
01:16:31,313 --> 01:16:33,702
Dr. Grant?

902
01:16:33,841 --> 01:16:36,361
Alan!

903
01:16:36,497 --> 01:16:39,912
They're not here.

904
01:17:05,485 --> 01:17:08,135
Anybody hear that?

905
01:17:08,269 --> 01:17:13,353
It's a, um
- It's an impact tremor is what it is.

906
01:17:13,484 --> 01:17:16,233
I'm fairly alarmed here.

907
01:17:16,395 --> 01:17:20,421
Come on, come on, come on. We gotta
get outta here. Now, now! Right now!

908
01:17:20,587 --> 01:17:24,361
Go, go, go!
Let's go!

909
01:17:24,522 --> 01:17:27,239
Start the engine!

910
01:17:32,969 --> 01:17:36,035
Must go faster!

911
01:17:36,169 --> 01:17:39,878
Here it comes! Fifth
gear! Shit! Shit! Shit!

912
01:17:45,799 --> 01:17:47,709
Get off the stick!
Bloody move!

913
01:17:47,848 --> 01:17:52,037
Look out!
Down!

914
01:18:14,019 --> 01:18:17,335
Think they'll have that
on the tour?

915
01:18:25,058 --> 01:18:28,374
Are you hearing this?

916
01:18:30,978 --> 01:18:35,799
Come on, Tim.
Come on, hurry up.

917
01:18:35,937 --> 01:18:40,192
Let's, uh, get up this tree. Oh, no.

918
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:43,931
Come on, Tim, it's okay.
Try up here. I don't want to.

919
01:18:44,064 --> 01:18:47,162
Okay.
Oh, man.

920
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:50,262
I hate trees.
They don't bother me.

921
01:18:50,398 --> 01:18:53,714
Oh, yeah, well,
you weren't in the last one.

922
01:19:05,021 --> 01:19:09,298
Hey, those are brontosauruses.
I mean, uh, brachiosaurs.

923
01:19:09,437 --> 01:19:12,600
They're singing.

924
01:19:37,465 --> 01:19:40,693
Shh, shh!

925
01:19:40,824 --> 01:19:43,060
Don't let the monsters come over
here! They're not monsters, Lex.

926
01:19:43,191 --> 01:19:45,493
They're just animals.
These are herbivores.

927
01:19:45,623 --> 01:19:49,397
That means they only eat vegetables, but
for you I think they'd make an exception.

928
01:19:49,527 --> 01:19:52,658
Tim. Oh, I hate the other kind.

929
01:19:52,790 --> 01:19:57,296
The other kind just...
do what they do.

930
01:20:09,748 --> 01:20:11,821
Ooh! Aah!

931
01:20:15,091 --> 01:20:17,033
What's that?

932
01:20:21,203 --> 01:20:26,123
What are you and Ellie gonna do now if you
don't have to pick up dinosaur bones anymore?

933
01:20:26,258 --> 01:20:31,276
I don't know. I guess...
we'll just have to evolve too.

934
01:20:33,585 --> 01:20:37,862
What do you call
a blind dinosaur?

935
01:20:38,064 --> 01:20:40,781
I don't know. What do
you call a blind dinosaur?

936
01:20:40,912 --> 01:20:43,246
Do-you-think-he-saurus.

937
01:20:45,967 --> 01:20:50,506
What do you call a blind
dinosaur's dog? You got me.

938
01:20:50,638 --> 01:20:53,453
A do-you-think-he-saurus'
Rex.

939
01:20:53,582 --> 01:20:56,615
Alan?

940
01:20:56,749 --> 01:21:01,538
Yeah? What if the dinosaurs
come back while we're asleep?

941
01:21:01,677 --> 01:21:04,492
Well, I'll stay awake.

942
01:21:04,621 --> 01:21:07,490
All night?

943
01:21:07,692 --> 01:21:10,594
All night.

944
01:21:53,446 --> 01:21:55,813
Hmph.

945
01:21:55,942 --> 01:21:59,520
They were
all melting.

946
01:22:01,989 --> 01:22:05,337
Malcolm's okay for now. I
gave him a shot of morphine.

947
01:22:07,748 --> 01:22:11,097
They'll be fine.

948
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:15,522
Who better to get the children through
Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?

949
01:22:19,683 --> 01:22:22,465
You know the first...

950
01:22:22,626 --> 01:22:27,414
attraction I ever built when
I came down from Scotland...

951
01:22:27,554 --> 01:22:31,001
was a flea circus,
Petticoat Lane.

952
01:22:31,137 --> 01:22:33,341
Really quite wonderful.

953
01:22:33,473 --> 01:22:37,466
We had, uh,
a wee trapeze and, uh,

954
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,388
a merry-go-

955
01:22:39,551 --> 01:22:44,406
A carousel.
Huh.

956
01:22:44,607 --> 01:22:46,941
And a seesaw.

957
01:22:47,103 --> 01:22:50,583
They all move motorized, of course, but, uh,
people would say they could see the fleas.

958
01:22:50,718 --> 01:22:53,979
"Oh, I can see the fleas, Mummy.
Can't you see the fleas?"

959
01:22:54,110 --> 01:22:58,549
Clown fleas and high-wire fleas
and fleas on parade.

960
01:23:04,412 --> 01:23:07,892
But with this place,

961
01:23:08,028 --> 01:23:12,021
I wanted to show them something
that wasn't an illusion.

962
01:23:12,187 --> 01:23:14,325
Something that was real.

963
01:23:14,523 --> 01:23:18,232
Something that they could...

964
01:23:18,362 --> 01:23:22,355
see and touch.

965
01:23:24,154 --> 01:23:28,310
An aim not devoid
of merit.

966
01:23:28,442 --> 01:23:32,270
But you can't think
through this one,John.

967
01:23:32,409 --> 01:23:34,296
You have to feel it.

968
01:23:34,424 --> 01:23:39,639
You're right.
You're absolutely right.

969
01:23:39,768 --> 01:23:43,412
Hiring Nedry was a mistake. That's
obvious. We're overdependent on automation.

970
01:23:43,575 --> 01:23:47,022
I can see that now. Now, the next
time, everything's correctable.

971
01:23:47,223 --> 01:23:49,011
John.
Creation...

972
01:23:49,143 --> 01:23:53,332
is an act
of sheer will.

973
01:23:53,461 --> 01:23:55,534
Next time,
it'll be flawless.

974
01:23:55,701 --> 01:23:59,084
It's still the flea circus.
It's all an illusion.

975
01:23:59,221 --> 01:24:04,042
When we have control again
- You've never had control. That's the illusion!

976
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:07,114
I was overwhelmed
by the power of this place!

977
01:24:07,252 --> 01:24:09,161
But I made a mistake too.

978
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:12,780
I didn't have enough respect
for that power and it's out now.

979
01:24:14,068 --> 01:24:16,489
The only thing
that matters now...

980
01:24:16,658 --> 01:24:19,953
are the people we love.

981
01:24:20,146 --> 01:24:23,528
Alan and Lex and Tim.

982
01:24:23,698 --> 01:24:28,519
John, they're out there
where people are dying.

983
01:24:34,128 --> 01:24:36,517
So-

984
01:24:42,575 --> 01:24:45,422
It's good.

985
01:24:47,855 --> 01:24:51,367
Spared no expense.

986
01:25:15,595 --> 01:25:19,140
Go away! It's okay, it's
okay. It's a brachiosaur.

987
01:25:19,306 --> 01:25:21,673
It's a veggie-saurus, Lex,
veggie-saurus.

988
01:25:21,834 --> 01:25:25,892
Veggie.
Come on, come on, girl.

989
01:25:26,058 --> 01:25:28,294
Come on.

990
01:25:28,425 --> 01:25:30,880
Come on.
Come on, baby.

991
01:25:34,024 --> 01:25:37,504
Yo! All right!

992
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:41,316
I'm not letting go!

993
01:25:49,894 --> 01:25:53,123
Looks like it has a cold. Yeah, maybe.

994
01:25:53,286 --> 01:25:55,358
Can I touch it?
Sure.

995
01:25:55,558 --> 01:26:00,194
Just think of it as...
kind of a big cow.

996
01:26:00,325 --> 01:26:04,001
I like cows.

997
01:26:12,388 --> 01:26:14,427
Hey, come on, girl.
Come on up here, girl.

998
01:26:14,562 --> 01:26:19,068
Come on, up here.

999
01:26:21,730 --> 01:26:25,079
God bless you!

1000
01:26:28,193 --> 01:26:32,383
Yuck! Oh, great, now she'll
never try anything new.

1001
01:26:32,512 --> 01:26:35,447
She'll just sit in her room and never
come out and play on her computer.

1002
01:26:35,584 --> 01:26:38,333
I'm a hacker! That's what
I said. You're a nerd.

1003
01:26:38,463 --> 01:26:41,562
I am not a computer nerd. I
prefer to be called a hacker.

1004
01:26:41,663 --> 01:26:45,973
Oh, God.

1005
01:26:47,487 --> 01:26:50,715
You know what this is?

1006
01:26:50,846 --> 01:26:53,267
It's a dinosaur egg.

1007
01:26:53,406 --> 01:26:57,977
The dinosaurs...
are breeding.

1008
01:26:59,613 --> 01:27:04,566
But, my grandpa said all
the dinosaurs were girls.

1009
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:07,961
Amphibian DNA.
What's that?

1010
01:27:08,123 --> 01:27:12,531
Well, on the tour,
the film said they used...

1011
01:27:12,667 --> 01:27:16,660
frog DNA to fill in
the gene sequence gaps.

1012
01:27:16,795 --> 01:27:19,729
They mutated the
dinosaur genetic code...

1013
01:27:19,866 --> 01:27:22,615
and blended it
with that of frogs.

1014
01:27:22,746 --> 01:27:27,830
Now, some West African frogs have been
known to spontaneously change sex...

1015
01:27:27,993 --> 01:27:32,727
from male to female
in a single sex environment.

1016
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:36,781
Malcolm was right.
Look.

1017
01:27:45,206 --> 01:27:48,686
Life found a way.

1018
01:27:48,823 --> 01:27:53,012
No, no, no, that's crazy.
You're out of your mind.

1019
01:27:53,141 --> 01:27:55,858
Wait a minute,
what exactly would this mean?

1020
01:27:55,989 --> 01:27:59,851
We're talking about a calculated risk,
which is about the only option left to us.

1021
01:28:00,021 --> 01:28:04,809
We will never find the command that Nedry
used. He's covered his tracks far too well.

1022
01:28:05,012 --> 01:28:07,499
I think it's obvious now
that he's not coming back.

1023
01:28:07,668 --> 01:28:10,057
So, shutting down
the entire system-

1024
01:28:10,227 --> 01:28:12,845
You can get somebody else,
because I won't do it.

1025
01:28:12,978 --> 01:28:17,931
Shutting down the system is the only
way to wipe out everything that he did.

1026
01:28:18,066 --> 01:28:21,514
Now, as I understand it, all the
systems will then come back...

1027
01:28:21,650 --> 01:28:24,039
on their original
start-up mode, correct?

1028
01:28:24,178 --> 01:28:27,308
Theoretically, yes. But we've never
shut down the entire system before.

1029
01:28:27,441 --> 01:28:30,091
It may not come back on at
all. Will we get the phones?

1030
01:28:30,224 --> 01:28:32,166
Yes, again,
in theory.

1031
01:28:32,336 --> 01:28:34,725
What about the
lysine contingency?

1032
01:28:34,928 --> 01:28:36,902
We could put that into
effect. What's that?

1033
01:28:37,104 --> 01:28:39,624
That is absolutely
out of the question.

1034
01:28:39,792 --> 01:28:41,701
The lysine contingency is intended to
prevent the spread of the animals...

1035
01:28:41,871 --> 01:28:43,660
in case they ever
get off the island.

1036
01:28:43,791 --> 01:28:47,238
Dr. Wu inserted a gene that creates a
single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism.

1037
01:28:47,375 --> 01:28:50,222
The animals can't manufacture
the amino acid lysine.

1038
01:28:50,350 --> 01:28:53,797
Unless they're completely supplied with
lysine by us, they slip into a coma and die.

1039
01:28:53,934 --> 01:28:57,162
People... are... dying.

1040
01:28:59,181 --> 01:29:03,174
Will you please
shut down the system?

1041
01:29:23,529 --> 01:29:25,798
Hold onto your butts.

1042
01:29:31,848 --> 01:29:33,636
Um.

1043
01:29:44,359 --> 01:29:46,595
It's okay.
Look. See that?

1044
01:29:46,726 --> 01:29:49,377
It's on.
It worked.

1045
01:29:49,510 --> 01:29:52,325
Wait a minute. What do you mean,
it worked? Everything's still off.

1046
01:29:52,453 --> 01:29:54,722
Maybe the shutdown tripped
the circuit breakers.

1047
01:29:54,853 --> 01:29:57,242
All we have to do is turn
them on, reboot the system:

1048
01:29:57,381 --> 01:29:59,999
telephones, security doors, half
a dozen others, but it worked.

1049
01:30:00,132 --> 01:30:02,368
System's ready.
Where are the breakers?

1050
01:30:02,501 --> 01:30:04,256
Maintenance shed,
the other end of the compound.

1051
01:30:04,388 --> 01:30:06,754
Three minutes, I can have power
back on in the entire park.

1052
01:30:06,915 --> 01:30:09,730
Just to be safe, I want everybody
in the emergency bunker...

1053
01:30:09,891 --> 01:30:13,403
until Mr. Arnold returns and the
whole system is running again.

1054
01:30:13,570 --> 01:30:15,425
I'm tired, I'm hot.
I'm dirty, my legs hurt.

1055
01:30:15,618 --> 01:30:17,506
Just keep going, guys.

1056
01:30:17,666 --> 01:30:22,138
The visitors center is just
about a mile over that rise.

1057
01:30:22,273 --> 01:30:25,622
Just... keep-

1058
01:30:25,761 --> 01:30:27,321
What is that?

1059
01:30:28,257 --> 01:30:31,420
Tim. Tim, can you tell me
what they are?

1060
01:30:33,824 --> 01:30:37,785
Gr- Ga, uh, uh,
gala-

1061
01:30:37,919 --> 01:30:39,893
Uh, gallimimus.

1062
01:30:40,063 --> 01:30:43,161
Are, are those, um,
meat-eating?

1063
01:30:43,359 --> 01:30:45,464
Um, meat-asaurusses?

1064
01:30:50,366 --> 01:30:52,602
Look at the wheeling.
Uniform direction changes...

1065
01:30:52,733 --> 01:30:56,726
just like a flock of birds
evading a predator.

1066
01:30:56,861 --> 01:31:00,309
They're, uh-
They're flocking this way.

1067
01:31:41,143 --> 01:31:43,117
I wanna go now.
Look how it eats.

1068
01:31:43,287 --> 01:31:47,083
Please! I bet you never look
at birds the same way again.

1069
01:31:47,286 --> 01:31:51,027
Yes.
Go now.

1070
01:31:51,158 --> 01:31:55,729
Okay. Keep low
and follow me.

1071
01:31:55,861 --> 01:31:58,130
Look how much blood.

1072
01:31:59,701 --> 01:32:02,570
Oh, God.
Something went wrong.

1073
01:32:02,708 --> 01:32:04,879
Something's happened.

1074
01:32:05,012 --> 01:32:08,623
Something's wrong.

1075
01:32:08,755 --> 01:32:10,762
This is just a delay.

1076
01:32:10,899 --> 01:32:13,386
All major theme parks
have delays.

1077
01:32:13,491 --> 01:32:17,614
When they opened Disneyland
in 1956, nothing worked. John.

1078
01:32:17,778 --> 01:32:19,949
But,John, if Pirates of
the Caribbean breaks down,

1079
01:32:20,114 --> 01:32:22,983
the pirates don't eat the
tourists. I can't wait anymore.

1080
01:32:23,185 --> 01:32:26,633
Something went wrong. I'm
gonna go get the power back on.

1081
01:32:26,769 --> 01:32:29,190
You can't just stroll
down the road, you know.

1082
01:32:29,328 --> 01:32:32,808
Don't let's be too hasty.
He's only been gone-

1083
01:32:34,768 --> 01:32:37,801
I'm going with you.
Okay.

1084
01:32:51,597 --> 01:32:53,385
Sorry.

1085
01:32:57,197 --> 01:33:01,255
This isn't going to be just like
switching on the kitchen light,

1086
01:33:01,388 --> 01:33:04,617
but I think I can follow this
and then talk you through it.

1087
01:33:08,779 --> 01:33:10,567
Right.

1088
01:33:14,282 --> 01:33:17,794
But, uh... it ought
to be me really going.

1089
01:33:17,930 --> 01:33:21,093
Why? Well, I'm
a- And you're, um-

1090
01:33:21,257 --> 01:33:24,257
- Look.
- Come on, let's go.

1091
01:33:24,457 --> 01:33:27,304
We can discuss sexism in survival
situations when I get back.

1092
01:33:27,497 --> 01:33:31,042
You just take me through this
step-by-step. I'm on channel two.

1093
01:33:31,176 --> 01:33:33,031
Right.

1094
01:34:02,756 --> 01:34:06,498
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

1095
01:34:06,627 --> 01:34:09,529
The shutdown must have
turned off all the fences.

1096
01:34:09,667 --> 01:34:12,863
Damn it, even Nedry knew better
than to mess with the raptor fences.

1097
01:34:18,337 --> 01:34:20,126
Come on, this way.

1098
01:34:26,272 --> 01:34:29,174
I can see the shed
from here.

1099
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:31,383
We can make it
if we run.

1100
01:34:31,552 --> 01:34:34,650
No. We can't.

1101
01:34:34,784 --> 01:34:38,166
Why not? Because we're being hunted.

1102
01:34:38,303 --> 01:34:41,685
Oh, God. In the bushes, straight ahead.

1103
01:34:44,095 --> 01:34:48,371
It's all right.
Like hell it is.

1104
01:34:48,509 --> 01:34:53,331
Run.
Towards the shed.

1105
01:34:53,469 --> 01:34:55,924
I've got her.

1106
01:34:56,092 --> 01:34:57,881
Go! Now!

1107
01:35:15,834 --> 01:35:18,800
Mr. Arnold?

1108
01:35:20,857 --> 01:35:23,857
Mr. Arnold?
John, I'm in.

1109
01:35:23,993 --> 01:35:26,197
Great. Now,

1110
01:35:26,329 --> 01:35:28,663
ahead of you
is a metal staircase.

1111
01:35:28,792 --> 01:35:33,713
Go down it.
Okay. Going down.

1112
01:35:33,879 --> 01:35:36,083
After 20 or 30 feet you come
to a T-junction. Take a left.

1113
01:35:37,527 --> 01:35:40,788
Have her follow the main cable. I
understand how to read a schematic.

1114
01:36:09,490 --> 01:36:12,010
I guess that means
the power's off.

1115
01:36:24,369 --> 01:36:27,216
That's not funny.
That was great.

1116
01:36:29,456 --> 01:36:32,652
Well, maybe, we could-

1117
01:36:48,366 --> 01:36:50,787
Damn it.
Dead end.

1118
01:36:50,925 --> 01:36:53,030
Uh, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

1119
01:36:53,197 --> 01:36:56,808
There should have been a right
turn back there somewhere.

1120
01:36:56,909 --> 01:36:59,876
Ellie, look above you.

1121
01:37:00,012 --> 01:37:03,492
There should be a large bundle of cable
and pipes all heading in the same direction.

1122
01:37:03,628 --> 01:37:07,588
- Follow that.
- Okay. Following the piping.

1123
01:37:10,058 --> 01:37:11,847
Timmy, I bet I could
climb over the top...

1124
01:37:11,978 --> 01:37:14,661
and be on the other side
before you could get to the top.

1125
01:37:14,794 --> 01:37:17,893
What would you give me?
Respect.

1126
01:37:18,026 --> 01:37:20,164
Come on, guys,
it's not a race.

1127
01:37:21,481 --> 01:37:26,598
I see the box.
It says "high voltage. "

1128
01:37:26,696 --> 01:37:28,965
Yeah. Okay.

1129
01:37:29,096 --> 01:37:31,300
Okay.

1130
01:37:34,887 --> 01:37:39,971
Good. Here we go.
Over the top.

1131
01:37:40,103 --> 01:37:43,364
Take your time, Tim.
That's good. Come on.

1132
01:37:43,526 --> 01:37:47,006
Find your footing.
Find your footing.

1133
01:37:47,141 --> 01:37:50,785
Ellie, you can't throw
the main switch by hand.

1134
01:37:50,917 --> 01:37:54,146
You've got to pump up the primer
handle in order to get the charge.

1135
01:37:54,277 --> 01:37:56,829
It's large,
flat and gray.

1136
01:37:56,964 --> 01:38:00,379
All right,
here I go. Okay?

1137
01:38:00,516 --> 01:38:05,851
One, two,
three, four.

1138
01:38:05,987 --> 01:38:07,874
Okay. Charged.

1139
01:38:08,002 --> 01:38:09,890
Under the words
"contact position"...

1140
01:38:10,051 --> 01:38:14,622
there's a round, green button
which says, "push to close. "

1141
01:38:14,754 --> 01:38:19,096
"Push to close. "
Okay.

1142
01:38:19,233 --> 01:38:21,175
Push it.

1143
01:38:28,512 --> 01:38:31,064
Ah!

1144
01:38:33,951 --> 01:38:39,068
Now, Ellie, the red buttons turn
on the individual park systems.

1145
01:38:39,199 --> 01:38:41,086
Switch 'em on.

1146
01:38:52,093 --> 01:38:54,264
Timmy! You're gonna have
to jump! Get down now!

1147
01:38:54,396 --> 01:38:56,338
You crazy?
I'm not gonna jump.

1148
01:38:56,476 --> 01:38:59,345
Do what Dr. Grant says! Let
go! I'll count to three! One,

1149
01:38:59,483 --> 01:39:02,233
two, three!

1150
01:39:02,363 --> 01:39:04,752
Control room.
Tour.

1151
01:39:04,891 --> 01:39:08,207
I'm coming up. I'm coming up to
get you. Lex, I've gotta get Tim.

1152
01:39:08,347 --> 01:39:10,451
Okay. I'm gonna
count to three.

1153
01:39:12,378 --> 01:39:14,418
One,

1154
01:39:15,897 --> 01:39:17,752
two-

1155
01:39:20,601 --> 01:39:22,705
Timmy!
Timmy!

1156
01:39:26,904 --> 01:39:28,879
He's not breathing.

1157
01:39:33,335 --> 01:39:36,880
Mr. Hammond, I think
we're back in business!

1158
01:39:37,014 --> 01:39:39,567
Oh, my God!

1159
01:39:43,798 --> 01:39:46,066
Goddamn!

1160
01:39:55,252 --> 01:39:57,488
Oh, Mr. Arnold.

1161
01:41:09,930 --> 01:41:13,225
Clever girl.

1162
01:41:32,743 --> 01:41:35,132
Tim!

1163
01:41:35,271 --> 01:41:38,020
No, Tim!

1164
01:41:40,134 --> 01:41:43,395
Good boy,
good boy.

1165
01:41:43,525 --> 01:41:46,208
Good boy,
good boy, Tim.

1166
01:41:46,342 --> 01:41:49,276
Three.

1167
01:41:52,420 --> 01:41:54,689
Hello?

1168
01:42:03,171 --> 01:42:07,447
Okay. I'm gonna
have to find the others,

1169
01:42:07,586 --> 01:42:10,041
get you to a doctor.

1170
01:42:12,161 --> 01:42:15,063
Lex, you look after Tim. Hey! Yeah.

1171
01:42:15,201 --> 01:42:18,998
Your hair is
all sticking up.

1172
01:42:19,137 --> 01:42:22,136
Big Tim,
the human piece of toast.

1173
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:27,898
I'll be back soon.
I promise.

1174
01:42:48,541 --> 01:42:51,093
Ellie!

1175
01:42:53,148 --> 01:42:56,246
- Run.
- Ellie!

1176
01:44:08,562 --> 01:44:11,660
It's just the two raptors,
right?

1177
01:44:11,762 --> 01:44:14,990
You sure the third one's contained? Yes.

1178
01:44:15,122 --> 01:44:17,707
Unless they figure out
how to open doors.

1179
01:44:42,413 --> 01:44:44,268
Timmy, what is it?

1180
01:44:44,397 --> 01:44:48,009
It's a velociraptor.

1181
01:44:48,141 --> 01:44:50,857
It's inside.

1182
01:45:12,202 --> 01:45:14,820
Follow me.

1183
01:47:44,309 --> 01:47:46,448
It's in there.

1184
01:47:46,645 --> 01:47:48,750
Control room.

1185
01:47:52,724 --> 01:47:54,512
We can call for help?

1186
01:47:54,643 --> 01:47:57,872
We gotta
reboot the system first.

1187
01:47:59,859 --> 01:48:01,833
The door locks!

1188
01:48:01,971 --> 01:48:03,858
Ellie, boot up
the door locks!

1189
01:48:07,058 --> 01:48:09,097
God!

1190
01:48:11,090 --> 01:48:14,799
No, boot up the door locks!

1191
01:48:14,961 --> 01:48:17,448
Ellie, get back!
Boot up the door locks!

1192
01:48:17,649 --> 01:48:20,332
You can't hold it
by yourself!

1193
01:48:27,568 --> 01:48:31,113
It's a UNIX system.
I know this.

1194
01:48:31,247 --> 01:48:34,662
It's all the files of the whole
park. It tells you everything.

1195
01:48:34,798 --> 01:48:36,620
Um, I gotta find
the right file.

1196
01:48:36,750 --> 01:48:39,303
Try to reach the gun!

1197
01:48:47,245 --> 01:48:49,067
I can't get it
unless I move.

1198
01:49:03,498 --> 01:49:05,887
Oh, this is it!
This might be the right file.

1199
01:49:06,026 --> 01:49:09,222
Wait. It's coming.
This isn't the right file.

1200
01:49:12,233 --> 01:49:15,167
Come on, Lex!
Oh!

1201
01:49:21,224 --> 01:49:23,612
You got it?
Yes!

1202
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:27,654
You got it!

1203
01:49:27,784 --> 01:49:29,823
Yes! Yes, this is it! Yes!

1204
01:49:33,287 --> 01:49:37,890
What works? Phones, security
systems; you name it, we got it.

1205
01:49:46,469 --> 01:49:50,746
- Grant?
- Mr. Hammond, the phones are working.

1206
01:49:50,884 --> 01:49:53,785
The children all right?
The children are fine.

1207
01:49:53,988 --> 01:49:57,784
Call the mainland. Tell 'em
to send the damn helicopters.

1208
01:49:57,987 --> 01:49:59,361
Gonna cut through the glass!

1209
01:50:02,754 --> 01:50:03,964
Grant!

1210
01:50:04,034 --> 01:50:05,376
Grant!

1211
01:50:50,300 --> 01:50:52,885
Move! Quickly!
Tim, move!

1212
01:51:33,622 --> 01:51:37,364
Tim, let go. Yeah.

1213
01:51:50,740 --> 01:51:52,649
Aaah!

1214
01:52:49,292 --> 01:52:51,299
Hold onto me!
Mr. Hammond!

1215
01:52:51,435 --> 01:52:54,086
After careful consideration,
I've decided...

1216
01:52:54,219 --> 01:52:58,179
not to endorse your park. So have I.
