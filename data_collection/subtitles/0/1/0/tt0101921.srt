2
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:45,423
<i>[Man] Yes, ma'am, how ya doin'?</i>

3
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,796
<i>Is this Rose Hill?</i>

4
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:50,427
<i>Good.
This is Ed Couch.</i>

5
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,937
<i>I'm Vesta Adcock's nephew.</i>

6
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,236
<i>I need to get up there
and see her,</i>

7
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:59,301
<i>but I'm gonna be late
'cause I'm lost out here.</i>

8
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,847
<i>We're off the Alabama interstate
but I don't know where.</i>

9
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:05,407
<i>[Train Whistle]</i>

10
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,654
<i>[Train Chugging]</i>

11

<i>[Train Rumbling]</i>

12
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:42,186
Did you hear that?
What?

13
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,314
The train.

14
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,257
No, I didn't hear
no train.

15
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:51,360
Oh, nothin',
I guess.

16
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:55,834
Where's "Whistle Stop" on
the map? I can't find it.

17
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:59,770
Why did you tell me to
turn right 10 miles back there?

18
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:04,834
God, you got a negative
sense of direction, hon.

19
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,778
[Woman]
I'm sorry.

20
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:12,045
Oh, Ed, your aunt's gonna be
so disappointed we're late.

21
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:16,111
I know she's been looking forward
to this visit all week long.

22
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:19,454
Bless her sweet,
little ol' heart.

23
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,463
Hey, how's my sweet Auntie V
this afternoon?

24
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:29,126
Remember us?

25
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:32,262
<i>Don't you look pretty!
We brought you something.</i>

26
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:35,501
<i>[Ed] Let me look at
you. [Auntie V: Grunting]</i>

27
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:38,169
<i>[Ed] Don't you know Evelyn loves you?</i>

28
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:43,079
Well, honey, I guess it'd be
better if you wait out here for me.

29
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:47,609
I'll get all this stuff.
Well, if you think it's best.

30
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,986
Yeah, I do this time.
Okay?

31
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,218
Have a nice day,
Aunt Vesta.

32
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,227
<i>[Ed] Don't you pitch a fit like that!</i>

33
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:09,902
Did you know
they took my gallbladder out?

34
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,471
No, I didn't.

35
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:17,209
<i>Oh, yes. Still
in the hospital in a jar.</i>

36
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:22,084
I guess that's where
they keep 'em.

37
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,123
I guess.

38
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,420
When I was
in the hospital,

39
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:30,451
the nurse gave me one of them
Fleet enemas they're so fond of.

40
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,124
Mrs. Cleo Threadgoode,

41
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,498
82 year old widow,
imagine that.

42
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:39,697
Actually,
everybody calls me Ninny.

43
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:42,002
'Course I'm
just visitin' here.

44
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:47,342
Did you ever have
one of them Fleet enemas?

45
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,347
Um, well?

46
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:51,474
No.

47
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:54,782
You'd remember it.

48
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:58,517
Me and my friend, Mrs. Otis,
come from Whistle Stop.

49
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:00,786
You ever been
to Whistle Stop?

50
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,261
Why, yes. I just
passed by there today.

51
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:09,199
<i>She's lived down the street
from me for 30 years or more.</i>

52
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:11,259
After her son died,

53
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:14,932
her daughter-in-law had a fit for
her to come live at the nursing home.

54
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:18,306
They asked me to come
and be her roommate.

55
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:22,610
<i>Mrs. Otis don't know it, but I'm going
home just soon as she gets settled in good.</i>

56
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:28,352
Does the name "Idgie
Threadgoode" ring a bell?

57
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:31,948
Um, no, ma'am.
I don't think so.

58
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:34,822
You'd remember her.

59
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:38,796
You see, I was practically
adopted by the Threadgoode family.

60
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:41,197
I married her brother,
Cleo. Oh, uh-huh.

61
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:46,034
<i>Idgie and her friend, Ruth,
ran the Whistle Stop Cafe.</i>

62
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:48,039
<i>Oh.</i>

63
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:50,803
Idgie was a character,
all right.

64
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:54,210
<i>But how anybody
could've thought...</i>

65
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,307
<i>she murdered that man
is beyond me.</i>

66
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,352
I beg your pardon?

67
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,981
You sit and relax a while.
I'll tell you all about it.

68
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:06,684
Oh, now, let's see.

69
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,217
I 'member the day they pulled
that truck up out of the river.

70
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:14,255
<i>[Ninny] That same rainy, summer day...</i>

71
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:19,270
<i>Idgie Threadgoode was arrested for
the murder of the owner of that truck,</i>

72
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:22,307
<i>Frank Bennett.</i>

73
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,044
I guess,
to understand Idgie,

74
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,810
you'd have to start way back
with her brother, Buddy.

75
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:35,820
<i>Idgie was Buddy's pet
from the day she was born.</i>

76
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:41,990
<i>I 'member the day we was all
gettin'ready for Leona's weddin'.</i>

77
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:44,029
<i>The war had just ended,</i>

78
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:46,428
<i>the Great one,
you know.</i>

79
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:51,163
<i>And another one was about to
begin in the Threadgoode house.</i>

80
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,671
<i>[Woman] Sipsey, honey, is that finished?</i>

81
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:58,176
<i>Buddy, get dressed, honey. Mama?</i>

82
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,212
Leona, what is it?

83
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,144
Idgie's upstairs
in her room...

84
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:04,183
and says she won't come out
as long as she lives.

85
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,377
She is gonna ruin my weddin'! Shh.

86
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:09,250
Leona, you're gonna be
the most beautiful bride.

87
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,587
Of course she is, Papa.

88
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:16,594
Your papa has spent every last
nickel he has just to make you happy.

89
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:20,462
Now, you try to act
a little grateful, young lady.

90
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,627
Imogene Louise Threadgoode!

91
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:26,228
This is your mama!

92
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:33,578
You come down here right now.
Do you hear me?

93
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:36,274
Buddy, fetch her. She'll listen
to you. Come on down, little bit.

94
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,909
<i>[Buddy] There's no firin'
squad waitin' for you.</i>

95
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:44,321
<i>[Mama] Ohh! Come on,
honey. Let us see you.</i>

96
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,551
<i>You look so pretty.</i>

97
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:49,459
<i>I see London, I see... Hush!</i>

98
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,633
Julian, hush.

99
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,430
<i>Come ahead, sweetheart.</i>

100
00:08:57,503 --> 00:09:01,234
<i>[Mama] You look awful nice in that.</i>

101
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:02,899
Mama!
You look fine.

102
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,466
<i>[Julian]
She looks like a monkey.</i>

103
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,342
<i>Julian, stop it
right this second!</i>

104
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:10,746
<i>[Idgie] Take it back!
Take it back! Idgie, hey!</i>

105
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:13,910
I told you she
was gonna ruin my weddin'!

106
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:16,352
<i>Idgie, get up.
Take it back!</i>

107
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,583
Take it back!

108
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:21,991
I'll get you for this.
No, Buddy.

109
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,722
<i>[Leona:
Sobbing]</i>

110
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:28,858
<i>[Mama] We have to be careful
when she's dressing up.</i>

111
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,869
<i>[Leona]
She's just a pain!</i>

112
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:34,464
<i>Leona, will you
stop shrieking!</i>

113
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,236
<i>This is your
weddin'day!</i>

114
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,087
<i>[Buddy] Looks like you got
yourself up a tree, little bit.</i>

115
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:54,183
[Idgie] I'm sick of
people makin' fun of me.

116
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,785
So you're gonna stay up here
all day long.

117
00:09:56,862 --> 00:10:00,059
Yep.
The hell with them.

118
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:04,068
Who wants to wear
that stupid ol' dress anyway?

119
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:07,503
<i>I ever tell you about
the oysters? Oysters?</i>

120
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:09,507
I tell you about the oysters? No.

121
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:14,239
<i>[Buddy] Think about the millions
of oysters lyin'around the ocean.</i>

122
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:16,645
Then one day...

123
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:19,514
God comes along and sees one
and he says,

124
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:22,486
"I think I'm gonna make
that one different."

125
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,750
You know what he does?

126
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:27,987
He puts a little
piece of sand in it.

127
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:32,292
Guess what it can do that
the others can't. What?

128
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:35,664
It can make
a beautiful pearl.

129
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,896
What if God
made a mistake?

130
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:43,067
Well, the way I figure it,
he never makes mistakes.

131
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,906
I mean, he made sure
we got together.

132
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,969
He made sure you got
the best looking,

133
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,242
most charmin' brother
in the world...

134
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,683
who's gonna beat you to the
chocolate cake. You will not.

135
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:56,119
Got you out of the tree,
didn't I?

136
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:59,123
Did not!

137
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:02,820
<i>[Reverend] Into this estate,
these two come now to be joined.</i>

138
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,988
<i>If any man present
can show cause...</i>

139
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,464
<i>why they may not lawfully
be joined together,</i>

140
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:12,664
let him speak now or
forever after hold his peace.

141
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,400
Please be seated.

142
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,972
If either of you
know any reason...

143
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:23,015
<i>why you may not justly be joined
together in holy matrimony,</i>

144
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:25,550
do you now confess it?

145
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,890
It is then your will
to proceed.

146
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:41,660
<i>Do you,
Charles Osgood Justice...</i>

147
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:50,839
<i>[Mama] Thank you. I don't know what
we'd do without your generosity.</i>

148
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,879
Sipsey, especially you.
Look what you've done!

149
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:57,882
[Sipsey] Thank you, Mrs.
Threadgoode. Gimme that, you rascal!

150
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,781
Ohh!
Jump on my back.

151
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:08,486
<i>[Ninny] I don't think there ever was
a sweeter boy than Buddy Threadgoode.</i>

152
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:13,055
You look beautiful, Lily.
Yes, Lily, you sure do.

153
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:16,568
<i>[Ninny] I had the biggest crush on him.</i>

154
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:18,967
<i>He was a terrible flirt!</i>

155
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:22,269
<i>But his heart belonged
to Ruth Jamison.</i>

156
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:25,504
<i>She was the daughter of
a friend of his mama's...</i>

157
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,376
<i>who was visitin'
that summer.</i>

158
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:31,905
Ruth Jamison, you're just
the one I've been lookin' for.

159
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:35,078
Are you thirsty? Let's
go visit someplace else.

160
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:38,089
<i>["My Blue Heaven"]</i>

161
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:40,921
<i>A little nest
that's nestled</i>

162
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:44,326
Think that's a big lake, you should've
seen the one next to our house.

163
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:46,523
We used to swim in it
and fish.

164
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,261
I sure do miss it.
Sure do.

165
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:52,065
What happened to it?
Did it dry up?

166
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,072
No, worse than that.

167
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,199
Last fall,
a flock of ducks,

168

smack in the middle of it.</i>

This fluke thing
happened.

170
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:05,016
The temperature dropped so fast
that the whole lake froze...

171
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,075
in three seconds,
just like that!

172
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,451
Those poor little ducks.
Did it kill them?

173
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:12,719
No, they flew off
and took the lake with 'em.

174
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:16,159
To this very day, that lake
is somewhere over in Georgia.

385

Your mother was so worried, she thought I

00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:07,116
Idgie, will you dance with me? No.

678
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:09,819
Come on.
It's only a dance.

679
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:16,724
Miss Idgie Threadgoode...
Get your butt off the floor.

680
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,031
Will you dance
with me?

681
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:27,005
I will not dance with you,
and I will not marry you.

682
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:30,240
Go marry Gladys Moats.
She just adores you.

683
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:34,273
But she did fall on her
head when she was a child.

684
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:38,784
You're just a goofy girl,
Idgie, a goofy girl.

685
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,847
Who're you callin'
a goof? Ow-ow-ow!

686
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:44,087
Who you callin' a goof? Stop
that before I get mad and hurt ya.

687
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:46,322
Oh, yeah.
You try it.

688
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:49,923
Grady! There now, you give up?

689
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,968
No, I'll never
give up!

690
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:56,563
<i>[Ninny] Grady finally
got dizzy and give up.</i>

691
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:01,270
<i>Try as they might, none of them
fellas could tame Idgie.</i>

692
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:04,174
<i>Now,
a little while later,</i>

693
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:08,014
<i>a letter
come from Ruth.</i>

694
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:15,285
Oh,
it's an obituary.

695
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,795
Oh, no, honey,
Ruth's mother died.

696
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:20,796
Oh.

697
00:48:20,864 --> 00:48:22,957
And this
is from the Bible.

698
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:25,593
<i>It's from
the book of Ruth.</i>

699
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:30,902
"And Ruth said,
whither thou goest, I will go;

700
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:33,306
"where thou lodgest,
I will lodge;

701
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:37,074
thy people
shall be my people."

702
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:59,028
[Idgie] All right, Julian,
you and Big George wait here.

703
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:14,243
Mama died.
I know.

704
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:20,755
And I'm pregnant.

705
00:49:38,075 --> 00:49:41,670
<i>[Idgie] Julian, I got another
box here when you're done!</i>

706
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:54,447
<i>[Idgie] I never seen
anybody with so many hats.</i>

707
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:56,685
<i>Why don't we put
three in one box?</i>

708
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,695
<i>I don't think we can fit
all these in the car.</i>

709
00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:02,857
<i>We're gonna need a separate
truck for all your stuff.</i>

710
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:04,867
<i>[Frank] What the hell is going on here?</i>

711
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:06,869
Looks like your wife's
leavin' you, mister.

712
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:11,772
<i>Sure she is. [Idgie] Don't
you touch her! Let go.</i>

713
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:15,437
You bastard!

714
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:17,446
<i>[Ruth]
Put her down!</i>

715
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,744
Bastard!
Whoooo!

716
00:50:19,816 --> 00:50:21,943
<i>[Ruth]
Stop it!</i>

717
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:26,416
Don't you hurt her!

718
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:29,391
<i>[Ruth]
Frank!</i>

719
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:32,622
[Groaning]

720
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:36,063
I wouldn't do that
if I was you, mister.

721
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:42,435
See, the thing is,
you might upset Big George.

722
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:44,906
<i>And he's crazy.</i>

723
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:49,071
<i>There's no tellin'
what he might do.</i>

724
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:13,233
Go on,
get outta here.

725
00:51:23,346 --> 00:51:25,974
- [Screaming]
- Hey!

726
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:29,348
<i>[Big George] Come on!
Hey, hey! Come on now!</i>

727
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:32,411
Let's go. Come on.
You okay?

728
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:35,083
<i>[Big George] Let's get Miss
Ruth and get outta here.</i>

729
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:38,855
<i>Come on, Miss Ruth.
Come on.</i>

730
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:44,356
If you ever touch her again,
I'll kill you.

731
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:53,271
<i>[Idgie] Well, I sure as
hell scared him, didn't I?</i>

732
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:55,971
<i>[Ruth]
Yeah, you sure scared him.</i>

733
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:59,015
<i>[Idgie] Towanda, the
amazing Amazon woman!</i>

734
00:51:59,082 --> 00:52:01,073
<i>[Ruth]
Towanda?</i>

735
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:03,949
<i>[Idgie Echoing]
Towanda! Towanda!</i>

736
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:09,792
<i>Evelyn?
Evelyn!</i>

737
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,021
Oh!
I'm sorry.

738
00:52:12,095 --> 00:52:14,154
I was just lookin'
at the pictures, Missy.

739
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:17,564
They have the greatest stories
in that magazine, don't they?

740
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:20,000
Will I see you
in group tonight?

741
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:22,595
We'll be talking about
masturbation.

742
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:26,768
No, I don't think so. I think I've
had enough learnin' for the time bein'.

743
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:30,609
Thank you.
Thank you.

744
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,410
Oh!
Excuse me.

745
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:36,475
Screw you!

746
00:52:43,226 --> 00:52:45,251
Excuse me,
young man.

747
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:49,128
There was no reason for you
to be so rude to me.

748
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:51,759
Get away from me, you fat
cow. What did you call me?

749
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:54,326
Beat it,
you old bitch.

750
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:57,373
Why are you being
so mean to me?

751
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,603
What did I ever
do to you...

752
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:04,135
I don't understand!

753
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:15,549
Look at my Stove Top!

754
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,865
Boo!

755
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:29,531
Oh, honey, what in the world
is the matter?

756
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:32,336
I don't know.

757
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:37,477
Come on.

758
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:40,539
Come on.
I need some exercise.

759
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:54,462
Now, you tell me what's
botherin' you, sugar.

760
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:59,093
I just...
I just feel so useless.

761
00:53:59,169 --> 00:54:03,003
So...
So powerless.

762
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:08,010
Everybody goes through that.
But I can't stop eatin'.

763
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:13,015
Every day I try and try
and every day I go off.

764
00:54:16,052 --> 00:54:19,078
I hide candy bars
all over the house.

765
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:22,124
A candy bar ain't
gonna hurt ya none.

766
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:26,526
One, no.
But 10 or 11?

767
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:31,298
I can't even look
at my own vagina.

768
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:34,826
I can't help ya
on that one.

769
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:39,307
I wish I had the courage to get
it over with and get really fat.

770
00:54:43,246 --> 00:54:47,683
Oh, Mrs. Threadgoode,
I just...

771
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:52,245
I'm too young to be old
and I'm too old to be young.

772
00:54:54,157 --> 00:54:56,990
Maybe I'm just
goin' crazy.

773
00:54:58,595 --> 00:55:01,792
You get hot flashes?

774
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:03,799
Sometimes.

775
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:07,894
You get the sweats and your
hearts starts a-poundin'?

776
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:10,303
- How did you know?
- Simple, honey.

777
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:14,070
You're going through
the change. [Sobbing]

778
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:18,638
[Laughing] I used to burst
into tears for no reason at all.

779
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,615
You need some hormones. Hmm?

780
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:26,281
Maybe some Stresstabs
number 4 for good measure.

781
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:29,814
- Really? Is that all?
- Sure, honey.

782
00:55:29,893 --> 00:55:32,225
You get yourself
some hormones.

783
00:55:32,295 --> 00:55:35,787
Then you get outta
the house and get a job.

784
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,601
With your
pretty complexion...

785
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:43,435
I'll bet you'll be
great with cosmetics.

786
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:48,402
I know how
you feel.

787
00:55:48,478 --> 00:55:51,914
I was about your age
when I had my child.

788
00:55:51,981 --> 00:55:54,472
Then I went through
the change of life.

789
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:59,181
I didn't know you had
a child. Yes, I did.

790
00:55:59,255 --> 00:56:02,224
Albert.

791
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:06,888
When he was born, the doctor said
it would be best if I didn't see him.

792
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:11,059
He said his mind would never
develop past the age of five,

793
00:56:11,134 --> 00:56:14,103
and I should just put him
in an institution...

794
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:18,834
because the burden of raisin' a
child like that would be too great.

795
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:24,878
Well, I thought
about Ruth.

796
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:28,781
She always said...

797
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:32,288
there was a separate
God for children.

798
00:56:32,355 --> 00:56:37,258
So I smiled at him and
I asked for the baby.

799
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:42,026
Oh, how could anybody think
that sweet, precious baby...

800
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:44,328
could ever
be a burden?

801
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:48,701
Why, from the minute he was born,
Albert was the joy of my life,

802
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:51,798
the Lord's
greatest gift.

803
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:56,437
I don't believe there was a purer
soul ever lived on this earth.

804
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:59,482
I had him with me
till he was 30.

805
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:03,815
Then he went to sleep
and didn't wake up.

806
00:57:05,221 --> 00:57:07,951
Sometimes I can't wait to get
to heaven to see him again.

807
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,528
<i>[Idgie]
Whoo!</i>

808
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:16,861
Shit!
It's a boy!

809
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:18,992
[Cheering]

810
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:22,765
I think a prayer of
thanksgivin' would be in order.

811
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:26,832
Goddamn it to hell, son-of-a-bitch,
she did it! Here's to Ruth!

812
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:31,176
<i>[Ninny] Idgie always did have a
way with words around the reverend.</i>

813
00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:35,373
<i>Well, Ruth had a baby.</i>

814
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:38,182
<i>She named him Buddy...
Buddy Junior.</i>

815
00:57:38,254 --> 00:57:43,385
<i>Papa went out and borrowed money so
Ruth and Idgie could start a cafe,</i>

816
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,690
<i>the Whistle Stop Cafe.</i>

817
00:57:45,762 --> 00:57:48,322
[Whistle]

818
00:57:50,433 --> 00:57:55,700
<i>When you come by my house
come down behind the jail</i>

819
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:58,366
<i>I've got a sign
on my door</i>

820
00:57:58,441 --> 00:58:00,705
<i>Barbecue for sale</i>

821
00:58:00,777 --> 00:58:03,541
<i>I'm talkin'
about barbecue</i>

822
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:08,550
<i>Only thing I crave</i>

823
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:11,678
<i>And a good-doin' meat</i>

824
00:58:11,754 --> 00:58:17,021
<i>Will carry me
to my grave</i>

825
00:58:17,093 --> 00:58:21,860
<i>I'm sellin' it for cheap
'cause I got good stuff</i>

826
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:24,195
<i>Miss Idgie,
can you get the door?</i>

827
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:27,862
Yes.
Big George.

828
00:58:27,937 --> 00:58:31,236
<i>[Man] Miss Ruth, me and the
missus want to thank you...</i>

829
00:58:31,307 --> 00:58:33,468
for sendin' that soup
over last night.

830
00:58:33,543 --> 00:58:37,775
I'll pay you when I get
ahead. You don't owe me, Ocie.

831
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:40,509
Thank you. I'm just glad they're better.

832
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:44,246
How is this, by the way?
It's good, very good.

833
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:47,778
<i>[Ruth] I'm not happy
till I see clean plates.</i>

834
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:52,985
Can't go on,
Idgie.

835
00:58:53,062 --> 00:58:55,360
I'm talking to you
as a friend.

836
00:58:55,431 --> 00:58:59,891
There's people in this town, paying
customers too... There you go.

837
00:58:59,969 --> 00:59:03,598
But some people
don't like you...

838
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:05,834
<i>sellin' to coloreds.</i>

839
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:07,877
Here you go.

840
00:59:07,944 --> 00:59:11,846
Tell you what. Next time
those "some people" come here,

841
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:14,349
I'm gonna ask if they

under those sheets...

843
00:59:16,653 --> 00:59:20,749

- More pie, Grady?

860
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:17,279
Don't make no sense. Big ox like Grady
won't sit next to a colored child,

all these ducks

Then the temperature dropped so
fast, the whole lake just froze.

Then the ducks took off
and took the lake with 'em.

1009
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:54,836
Thank you.

1010
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:57,337
Hi there. What can I do for you boys?

1011
01:12:57,406 --> 01:12:59,340
Idgie.
Grady.

1012
01:12:59,408 --> 01:13:02,571
This here is Sheriff
Curtis Smoote. Hi there.

1013
01:13:02,644 --> 01:13:05,704
He's over here from Georgia.
He's lookin' for a fella. Oh.

1014
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:10,909
You recognize him?
No.

1015
01:13:10,986 --> 01:13:15,753
That's my husband, but I
haven't seen him in months.

1016
01:13:15,824 --> 01:13:19,055
I heard he got run over
by a Brinks armored truck.

1017
01:13:19,128 --> 01:13:21,153
[Idgie]
What's he done?

1018
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:25,223
Nothin' that we know of. We're tryin'
to find out what's been did to him.

1019
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:28,792
He told his hired man he was
comin' to see his wife and baby,

1020
01:13:28,871 --> 01:13:32,864
but he ain't never
showed up back home.

1021
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:35,637
Hell, I told him
if he showed up in this town,

1022
01:13:35,711 --> 01:13:37,838
we'd all have known.

1023
01:13:37,913 --> 01:13:40,347
Looks a little sissified
to me.

1024
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:44,409
From what I hear,
most you boys in Georgia...

1025
01:13:44,486 --> 01:13:45,919
<i>are a little light
on your feet.</i>

1026
01:13:45,988 --> 01:13:49,151
That's the way
I heard it.

1027
01:13:49,224 --> 01:13:51,351
Could I interest you
in some pie?

1028
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:55,329
No, ma'am, but that
barbecue sure smells good.

1029
01:13:55,397 --> 01:13:58,833
Best damn barbecue
in the state of Alabama.

1030
01:14:28,063 --> 01:14:30,691
Here you go.
That's your 4th one today.

1031
01:14:30,766 --> 01:14:33,599
I swear you're about
to eat up all my barbecue.

1032
01:14:33,669 --> 01:14:39,474
Sit down.

1033
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:43,271
You ain't foolin' me,
girlie girl.

1034
01:14:43,345 --> 01:14:46,007
I know who you are.

1035
01:14:46,081 --> 01:14:49,244
I heard from Bennett's hired hand
that you threatened to kill Frank.

1036
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:52,515
<i>He ain't showed up
dead yet.</i>

1037
01:14:52,588 --> 01:14:56,354
But if he does, you in a whole
mess of trouble. You understand?

1038
01:14:56,425 --> 01:15:00,486
<i>What we talkin'about
is murder here.</i>

1039
01:15:00,562 --> 01:15:03,759
<i>Runnin'a foul of the law
and nobody gets away with that,</i>

1040
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:07,632
not even a bunch
of Alabama smart alecks.

1041
01:15:07,703 --> 01:15:10,331
If I find so much
as a hair of his head,

1042
01:15:10,405 --> 01:15:13,067
I'll arrest you faster
than you can slap a tick,

1043
01:15:13,141 --> 01:15:18,704
<i>'cause I'm the law,
and you can't beat the law.</i>

1044
01:15:38,967 --> 01:15:42,334
Hey there.
[Sighs]

1045
01:15:42,404 --> 01:15:44,998
Tell me what he said.

1046
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:49,942
Smoote's? I told you.
He said...

1047
01:15:50,012 --> 01:15:53,311
that was the best damn
barbecue he ever had.

1048
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:56,112
That's all?
No.

1049
01:15:56,184 --> 01:16:02,589
What else? He said the
pie was pretty good too.

1050
01:16:07,529 --> 01:16:10,191
You sure you ain't
never seen this man, boy?

1051
01:16:10,265 --> 01:16:13,894
<i>[Big George] Yes, sir, and I already
told ya, I ain't never seen him.</i>

1052
01:16:13,969 --> 01:16:16,460
You'd do anything for
Miss Idgie, wouldn't ya, boy?

1053
01:16:18,373 --> 01:16:20,307
Yes, sir.

1054
01:16:23,545 --> 01:16:27,140
Would ya kill for her?
Did ya kill for her?

1055
01:16:34,523 --> 01:16:36,650
No, sir.

1056
01:16:36,725 --> 01:16:41,560
Well, now, maybe one of these
days you'll tell the truth.

1057
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:46,295
Just remember, we hang
lyin' niggers in Georgia...

1058
01:16:46,368 --> 01:16:49,337

Takin' care of business,
havin' a good time.

1066
01:17:48,096 --> 01:17:51,657
I've been thinkin'
maybe I should move on...

1067
01:17:51,733 --> 01:17:54,201
<i>because of Frank

<i>I just...</i>

1071
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:07,010
don't want to be selfish,
that's all.

1072
01:18:07,082 --> 01:18:09,414
Maybe if I wasn't here,
you'd settle down.

1073
01:18:09,484 --> 01:18:14,387
I'm as settled
as I ever hope to be.

1074
01:18:29,004 --> 01:18:33,703
Then... why can't you
tell me where you were?

1075
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:47,311
I had a dream...
the other night.

1076
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:52,691
I dreamt that
Buddy was gone.

1077
01:18:52,761 --> 01:18:57,221
I ran to his crib and there
he was, sleepin' like an angel.

1078
01:18:57,299 --> 01:18:59,927
You know,
I thanked God...

1079
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:02,970
for lettin' me
still have Buddy.

1080
01:19:03,038 --> 01:19:05,598
And I remembered...

1081
01:19:05,674 --> 01:19:09,405
havin' the same reaction
after Frank would beat me,

1082
01:19:09,478 --> 01:19:13,175
thankin' the Lord for givin' me
the strength to take it.

1083
01:19:13,248 --> 01:19:15,409
And I remembered...

1084
01:19:15,484 --> 01:19:19,921
thankin' the Lord
for each day my mother lived,

1085
01:19:20,989 --> 01:19:24,288
even when she was
spittin' up blood...

1086
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:28,227
and prayin' for me
to kill her.

1087
01:19:28,296 --> 01:19:32,392
<i>I looked in my mother's eyes
pleadin'for me to help her...</i>

1088
01:19:32,467 --> 01:19:36,961
and all I could do
was pray.

1089
01:19:40,742 --> 01:19:44,735
While you were gone,
as I was holdin' Buddy,

1090
01:19:44,813 --> 01:19:49,273
I thought if that bastard,
Frank Bennett...

1091
01:19:49,351 --> 01:19:54,050
ever tries
to take my child,

1092
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:57,558
I won't pray.

1093
01:19:57,626 --> 01:20:00,220
I'll break his neck.

1094
01:20:03,565 --> 01:20:07,592
<i>Ruth, you don't have to worry
about Frank Bennett anymore.</i>

1095

How can you say that?
It's his child too.

1096
01:20:11,373 --> 01:20:14,103
He won't give up
on his blood.

1097
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:17,543
I'm only gonna
tell you this one time.

1173
01:25:50,245 --> 01:25:53,271
Where were we?

1174
01:25:53,348 --> 01:25:56,078
You didn't kill Ed,
did ya?

1175
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:59,814
Not yet.
Oh, good.

1176
01:25:59,888 --> 01:26:04,552
Anyway, five years had passed
since Frank Bennett disappeared.

1177
01:26:04,626 --> 01:26:09,325
<i>[Ninny] And Smokey Lonesome been
missin'ever since that same terrible night.</i>

1178
01:26:09,397 --> 01:26:12,457
<i>I 'member the day
when he showed up again.</i>

1179
01:26:13,401 --> 01:26:15,369
My God, son,

1180
01:26:15,436 --> 01:26:17,597
you're the spittin'
image of Ruth.

1181
01:26:17,672 --> 01:26:21,005
Buddy Threadgoode, Jr.
Nice to meet you, sir.

1182
01:26:21,075 --> 01:26:23,441
Well, sir,
Smokey Lonesome.

1183
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:26,708
<i>[Ninny] Curtis Smoote was making one
of his visits to Whistle Stop, Alabama,</i>

1184
01:26:26,781 --> 01:26:29,579
<i>still huntin'and peckin'
for any scrap of evidence...</i>

1185
01:26:29,651 --> 01:26:32,677
<i>about Frank Bennett's
whereabouts.</i>

1186
01:26:32,754 --> 01:26:35,245
<i>[Ruth] Who wants to begin? Oh, I do.</i>

1187
01:26:35,323 --> 01:26:37,154
<i>I do, Miss Ruth.
Thank you.</i>

1188
01:26:37,225 --> 01:26:40,490
We'll begin
on page five.

1189
01:26:40,562 --> 01:26:43,827
<i>[Ninny] Life has a funny
way of working things out.</i>

1190
01:26:43,898 --> 01:26:45,729
Well, hey there!

1191
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:49,361
<i>Smokey!
Idgie?</i>

1192
01:26:49,437 --> 01:26:52,964
Smokey Lonesome!
If it isn't old home week.

1193
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:56,636
How are you? Well, I'm
rattlin' but I'm rollin'.

1194
01:26:56,711 --> 01:27:00,272
What brings you to these
parts? Smell of good cookin'.

1195
01:27:00,348 --> 01:27:01,940
Hey, Smokey.

1196
01:27:02,016 --> 01:27:05,076
Sipsey. Let me fix you some lunch.

1197
01:27:05,153 --> 01:27:09,556
You know just about everybody
except Curtis Smoote.

1198
01:27:09,624 --> 01:27:13,116
<i>He's the officer from
over at Valdosta, Georgia.</i>

1199
01:27:13,194 --> 01:27:17,290
He's been lookin' for the same man for
almost 5 years. Very stubborn fella.

1200
01:27:17,365 --> 01:27:21,301
<i>He loves our barbecue.</i>

1201
01:27:21,369 --> 01:27:22,700
<i>[Buddy, Jr.]
Mommy! Mommy!</i>

1202
01:27:23,404 --> 01:27:25,338
<i>[Screaming]</i>

1203
01:27:30,878 --> 01:27:32,812
<i>Buddy.</i>

1204
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,814
Everybody
outta the way.

1205
01:27:34,882 --> 01:27:38,648
Give him here.
Let him go. I've got him.

1206
01:27:40,622 --> 01:27:42,817
Come on. You're
gonna be all right.

1207
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:45,222
Open the door!

1208
01:27:45,293 --> 01:27:49,354
<i>[Idgie] Put him in the
car. It's all right, honey.</i>

1209
01:27:53,968 --> 01:27:57,529
<i>["Taps"]</i>

1210
01:28:10,585 --> 01:28:12,485
<i>[Ruth]
I can understand...</i>

1211
01:28:12,553 --> 01:28:15,078
having a funeral
for an arm.

1212
01:28:15,156 --> 01:28:18,683
I just don't know why she
insists on callin' him "Stump."

1213
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:21,752
<i>[Sipsey] She say everybody
else gonna be callin'him that...</i>

1214
01:28:21,829 --> 01:28:25,925
so we might just as well
be the first.

1215
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:30,164
Okay, ice cream
and cake for everybody.

1216
01:28:30,238 --> 01:28:32,035
Go on.

1217
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:40,304
My daddy always used to say there
was a separate God for children.

1218
01:28:44,185 --> 01:28:47,712
<i>[Ninny] The good Lord was
watchin' over stump that day.</i>

1219
01:28:47,789 --> 01:28:51,156
<i>But then it started to rain
that month.</i>

1220
01:28:51,225 --> 01:28:56,060
<i>It rained and rained, and it
flooded parts of Whistle Stop.</i>

1221
01:28:56,130 --> 01:29:01,261
<i>That's why Grady's deputies stumbled
onto Frank Bennett's pickup truck,</i>

1222
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:05,329
<i>and I just knew Idgie'd
never get out of this mess.</i>

1223
01:29:05,406 --> 01:29:09,172
Now, you in or out? Remember,
I didn't take any cards.

1224
01:29:09,243 --> 01:29:11,677
Look at me and
let me see your face.

1225
01:29:11,746 --> 01:29:13,976
Idgie, I have to talk
to you. You're bluffin'.

1226
01:29:14,048 --> 01:29:17,814
Why don't you sit in? I'll deal
you a new hand. Gladys won't mind.

1227
01:29:17,885 --> 01:29:19,978
In private, Idgie.

1228
01:29:20,054 --> 01:29:23,080
Excuse us, Ruth.

1229
01:29:23,157 --> 01:29:27,423
A-ha. I'm just tryin' to teach
you not to fall for any tricks.

1230
01:29:27,495 --> 01:29:30,123
You're doin'
a great job.

1231
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:41,170
What's your hurry?

1232
01:29:41,242 --> 01:29:44,473
And what is
so important?

1233
01:29:44,545 --> 01:29:46,775
What's that?

1234
01:29:46,848 --> 01:29:50,181
<i>[Grady] Somebody found Frank
Bennett's truck in the river.</i>

1235
01:29:50,251 --> 01:29:53,414
What's that got
to do with me?

1236
01:29:53,488 --> 01:29:57,447
Officially, you and Big George
are under arrest for murder.

1237
01:29:57,525 --> 01:30:00,426
You're in my custody
until tomorrow.

1238
01:30:00,495 --> 01:30:03,191
I'm supposed to take you to
Georgia first thing in the morning.

1239
01:30:05,266 --> 01:30:07,461
<i>Unless, of course...</i>

1240
01:30:07,535 --> 01:30:10,265
Well, some people have
been known to pack up...

1241
01:30:10,338 --> 01:30:14,741
and sneak out of town
in the middle of the night.

1242
01:30:16,477 --> 01:30:19,037
<i>[Idgie]
What about Big George?</i>

1243
01:30:19,113 --> 01:30:21,843
Well, the way
I figure it,

1244
01:30:21,916 --> 01:30:25,147
they'd be satisfied
if they had him.

1245
01:30:25,219 --> 01:30:27,278
Idgie,
this is serious.

1246
01:30:27,355 --> 01:30:29,949
We're talkin'
murder of a white man.

1247
01:30:30,024 --> 01:30:32,254
Someone's
gonna have to pay.

1248
01:30:32,326 --> 01:30:35,159
Nobody wants
to hang a woman.

1249
01:30:36,697 --> 01:30:38,688
No deal.

1250
01:30:38,766 --> 01:30:41,360
Idgie, I know how you feel
about Big George.

1251
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:43,563
Hell, we all do.

1252
01:30:43,638 --> 01:30:46,801
But these just
the facts of life.

1253
01:30:49,243 --> 01:30:51,507
I can't do that.

1254
01:30:51,579 --> 01:30:54,343
Take me to jail
if you have to.

1255
01:30:54,415 --> 01:30:56,906
Well, that's what
I thought you'd say...

1256
01:30:56,984 --> 01:30:59,384
'cause you're absolutely,
unconditionally,

1257
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:03,948
<i>positively the most stubborn
person I've known in my life.</i>

1258
01:31:05,793 --> 01:31:10,492
<i>[Ninny] Idgie and Big George went
to the county jail in Valdosta...</i>

1259
01:31:10,565 --> 01:31:14,365
<i>to await trial for
the murder of Frank Bennett.</i>

1260
01:31:14,435 --> 01:31:16,562
<i>They didn't have
to wait too long.</i>

1261
01:31:16,637 --> 01:31:20,038
Did you know Frank Bennett? No, sir.

1262
01:31:20,107 --> 01:31:22,507
You mean, you
never met the man...

1263
01:31:22,577 --> 01:31:27,105
<i>whose wife, Ruth, is your
business partner? That's right.</i>

1264
01:31:27,181 --> 01:31:30,014
You never threatened to kill
Frank Bennett at his home...

1265
01:31:30,084 --> 01:31:33,781
in front of his hired man
in June of 1932?

1266
01:31:33,855 --> 01:31:38,883
<i>The same Frank Bennett you did not
know. Oh, that was me, all right.</i>

1267
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:42,191
<i>I thought you wanted to know if we'd
ever met... and the answer is no.</i>

1268
01:31:42,263 --> 01:31:44,823
<i>Um, I threatened
to kill him,</i>

1269
01:31:44,899 --> 01:31:49,063
<i>but we were never, what you
might say, properly introduced.</i>

1270
01:31:49,136 --> 01:31:53,129
Is it not true that in September
of 1932 you came to Valdosta...

1271
01:31:53,207 --> 01:31:57,041
<i>and took Frank Bennett's wife and
child back to Alabama with you?</i>

1272
01:31:57,111 --> 01:31:59,579
Um... just the wife.
The child came later.

1273
01:31:59,647 --> 01:32:03,105
How much later? The usual. Nine months.

1274
01:32:03,184 --> 01:32:06,051
<i>[Laughter] I suggest that you bribed...</i>

1275
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:11,422
this poor, weak woman with
promises of liquor and money,

1276
01:32:11,492 --> 01:32:15,223
and she lost control
of her senses momentarily.

1277
01:32:15,296 --> 01:32:18,288
When her husband came back
to get her and take her home,

1278
01:32:18,366 --> 01:32:22,996
you and your colored man
murdered him in cold blood.

1279
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:25,797
No, sir.

1280
01:32:25,873 --> 01:32:31,140
Well, where were you on the
night of September 30, 1933?

1281
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:33,510
I was at the town hall
doing a show.

1282
01:32:33,581 --> 01:32:36,675
And after that? I was
at my mother's house.

1283
01:32:36,751 --> 01:32:39,276
Oh, yeah?
Who was with you?

1284
01:32:39,353 --> 01:32:43,687
<i>Just Big George and myself. What about
your mother? Can she confirm that?</i>

1285
01:32:43,758 --> 01:32:46,022
No, sir.
She died a year ago.

1286
01:32:46,093 --> 01:32:48,584
I'm sorry to hear that.

1287
01:32:48,663 --> 01:32:52,360
But do you expect 12 intelligent
men to believe you,

1288
01:32:52,433 --> 01:32:55,061
although one witness is dead and
the other is a colored man,

1289
01:32:55,136 --> 01:32:58,537
known to be a worthless,
no-good, lying nigger?

1290
01:32:58,606 --> 01:33:00,870
You expect these men
to take your word for it...

1291
01:33:00,942 --> 01:33:03,604
<i>Just because
you say so?</i>

1292
01:33:03,678 --> 01:33:08,206
That's right, you gump-faced,
blown-up, baboon-assed bastard!

1293
01:33:08,282 --> 01:33:11,740
<i>[Gasping] One more outburst like that...</i>

1294
01:33:11,819 --> 01:33:15,311
and I'll hold you in contempt
of court. You understand?

1295
01:33:15,389 --> 01:33:18,187
Yes, sir.

1296
01:33:19,894 --> 01:33:23,455
Oh, Lord.
Next witness.

1297
01:33:26,033 --> 01:33:27,500
<i>[Prosecutor] Did you know
that you were pregnant...</i>

1298
01:33:27,568 --> 01:33:30,503
<i>at the time
you left Valdosta?</i>

1299
01:33:30,571 --> 01:33:32,505
<i>[Ruth]
Yes.</i>

1300
01:33:32,573 --> 01:33:36,168
<i>And yet, you tell us
over and over...</i>

1301
01:33:36,243 --> 01:33:40,805
<i>that you went with this
woman... willingly?</i>

1302
01:33:40,881 --> 01:33:45,079
Yes. I wouldn't raise
my child with Frank Bennett.

1303
01:33:45,152 --> 01:33:47,245
<i>But why?</i>

1304
01:33:47,321 --> 01:33:51,519
<i>Did this woman promise you money? No.</i>

1305
01:33:51,592 --> 01:33:54,152
<i>A bigger home?</i>

1306
01:33:54,228 --> 01:33:57,322
No. No.

1307
01:33:57,398 --> 01:34:00,026
<i>Then tell us,
Mrs. Bennett,</i>

1308
01:34:00,101 --> 01:34:02,626
<i>why would a respectable
Christian woman...</i>

1309
01:34:02,703 --> 01:34:05,501
<i>go anywhere with this Idgie
Threadgoode... I object.</i>

1310
01:34:05,573 --> 01:34:07,700
<i>Whose reputation
is known far and wide...</i>

1311
01:34:07,775 --> 01:34:10,005
<i>as a notorious liar
and drunkard?</i>

1312
01:34:10,077 --> 01:34:12,375
<i>- Objection!
- Sustained!</i>

1313
01:34:15,783 --> 01:34:18,081
<i>Why did you leave...</i>

1314
01:34:18,152 --> 01:34:22,111
<i>with Idgie Threadgoode
that day?</i>

1315
01:34:23,524 --> 01:34:26,823
<i>[Judge] Answer the
question, Mrs. Bennett.</i>

1316
01:34:27,695 --> 01:34:30,721
Because she...

1317
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:35,894
She's the best friend
I ever had,

1318
01:34:35,970 --> 01:34:38,063
and I love her.

1319
01:34:38,773 --> 01:34:41,674
<i>[Prosecutor] Thank you, Mrs.
Bennett. That will be all.</i>

1320
01:34:41,742 --> 01:34:44,575
<i>[Defense Attorney] The defense
calls as its last witness...</i>

1321
01:34:44,645 --> 01:34:47,375
<i>the Rev.
Herbert Scroggins.</i>

1322
01:34:48,716 --> 01:34:51,708
Place your right hand
on the Bible, please.

1323
01:34:51,786 --> 01:34:54,983
I brought my own,
if you don't mind.

1324
01:34:55,056 --> 01:34:59,117
You swear to tell the whole
truth and nothing but the truth?

1325
01:34:59,193 --> 01:35:01,184
I do.

1326
01:35:03,230 --> 01:35:07,462
<i>[Defense Attorney] You have
information about the whereabouts...</i>

1327
01:35:07,535 --> 01:35:11,130
<i>of Idgie Threadgoode and her
colored man, known as Big George,</i>

1328
01:35:11,205 --> 01:35:14,971
on the night
of September 30, 1933?

1329
01:35:15,042 --> 01:35:17,010
Yes, sir,
I do.

1330
01:35:17,078 --> 01:35:19,512
<i>It has been
suggested here...</i>

1331
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:23,038
<i>that she and her colored man
were at her mother's house.</i>

1332
01:35:23,117 --> 01:35:27,349
<i>Can you confirm that?
No, sir. That is a lie.</i>

1333
01:35:27,421 --> 01:35:30,151
[Whispering]
Oh, shit.

1334
01:35:30,224 --> 01:35:33,455
<i>[Rev. Scroggins] It has been my
habit to write all the dates...</i>

1335
01:35:33,527 --> 01:35:36,462
<i>of the activities of
the church in my Bible.</i>

1336
01:35:36,530 --> 01:35:41,194
<i>I show that the night
of September 30, 1933...</i>

1337
01:35:41,268 --> 01:35:44,294
was the start of our
annual revival...

1338
01:35:44,371 --> 01:35:47,135
down at the
Baptist campground.

1339
01:35:47,208 --> 01:35:49,301
Sister Threadgoode
was there...

1340
01:35:49,376 --> 01:35:53,403
<i>along with her hired man,
George Pullman,</i>

1341
01:35:53,481 --> 01:35:57,611
who was in charge of the
barbecue as he has been...

1342
01:35:57,685 --> 01:36:00,347
<i>for the last ten years.
Objection.</i>

1343
01:36:00,421 --> 01:36:04,949
That doesn't mean anything. Murder could've
taken place any time the next couple of days.

1344
01:36:05,025 --> 01:36:10,053
<i>Have you ever been to one of
our revivals, sir? Well, no.</i>

1345
01:36:10,131 --> 01:36:12,190
Do you attend church
regularly, sir?

1346
01:36:12,266 --> 01:36:14,461
'Course I do.

1347
01:36:14,535 --> 01:36:19,063
<i>Good. Well, maybe if you
attended one of our revivals,</i>

1348
01:36:19,140 --> 01:36:21,506
<i>you'd know
they last three days...</i>

1349
01:36:21,575 --> 01:36:23,907
and three nights,
Your Honor.

1350
01:36:24,645 --> 01:36:26,112
<i>[Gavel Pounding]</i>

1351
01:36:26,180 --> 01:36:29,149
<i>[Judge]
Approach the bench.</i>

1352
01:36:29,216 --> 01:36:33,915
Percy, it don't look like
you got a case at all.

1353
01:36:33,988 --> 01:36:36,548
In the first place,
there's no body.

1354
01:36:36,624 --> 01:36:39,889
Second, we got us a preacher
nobody's gonna dispute.

1355
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:44,158
But, Your Honor... I'm tellin' you.
What you got is a lot of nothing.

1356
01:36:44,231 --> 01:36:47,462
<i>[Judge] I say Frank
Bennett got himself drunk,</i>

1357
01:36:47,535 --> 01:36:51,699
<i>drove into the river and
was long ago eaten up...</i>

1358
01:36:51,772 --> 01:36:54,935
and I don't give
a good goddamn!

1359
01:36:55,009 --> 01:36:58,467
What we got here is a
case of accidental death.

1360
01:36:58,546 --> 01:37:00,173
Case dismissed.

1361
01:37:00,247 --> 01:37:02,681
Whoo!

1362
01:37:09,623 --> 01:37:12,524
See you in church,
Sister?

1363
01:37:13,427 --> 01:37:15,657
Reverend.

1364
01:37:15,729 --> 01:37:20,029
I can't believe he
actually swore on a Bible.

1365
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:22,034
Well, not really.

1366
01:37:22,102 --> 01:37:24,093
If that judge
had looked closer,

1367
01:37:24,171 --> 01:37:27,231
<i>he'd have seen it was really
a copy of Moby Dick.</i>

1368
01:37:29,276 --> 01:37:33,679
But why did he do it? For the sheer
joy of seeing you in church again...

1369
01:37:33,747 --> 01:37:36,580
which I suggested to him
might be your penance.

1370
01:37:36,650 --> 01:37:39,278
You didn't promise him,
did you? Yes, ma'am, I did.

1371
01:37:39,353 --> 01:37:41,287
And I never
break my word.

1372
01:37:41,355 --> 01:37:45,724
If I live 1,000 years,
I will never forgive you.

1373
01:37:45,793 --> 01:37:49,957
I don't know what's worse,
church or jail.

1374
01:38:00,941 --> 01:38:04,069
There now.
Don't you look pretty?

1375
01:38:04,144 --> 01:38:06,271
Oh, yes, honey.

1376
01:38:06,347 --> 01:38:11,011
You'll have me lookin' like
Ginger Rogers before you're done.

1377
01:38:11,085 --> 01:38:15,317
Don't let Mr. Dunaway see me.
He's liable to go wild.

1378
01:38:16,824 --> 01:38:20,055
I'm glad to see
you're in a good mood.

1379
01:38:20,127 --> 01:38:23,255
You've slimmed down quite a bit
in the last few weeks.

1380
01:38:23,330 --> 01:38:27,630
I'm just so happy Big George
and Idgie got off.

1381
01:38:27,701 --> 01:38:30,693
I would have killed Frank
Bennett if I could've.

1382
01:38:30,771 --> 01:38:33,296
Did anybody really
think she did it?

1383
01:38:33,374 --> 01:38:36,002
Some said yes,
some said no.

1384
01:38:36,076 --> 01:38:39,204
'Course the only one who really
knew was Frank Bennett.

1385
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:44,684
And you know what they say.
Dead men tell no tales.

1386
01:38:45,352 --> 01:38:47,650
<i>[Evelyn]
Towanda-a-a!</i>

1387
01:38:47,721 --> 01:38:50,884
<i>[Grunting]</i>

1388
01:39:10,945 --> 01:39:13,971
Evelyn, what in the hell
are you doing?

1389
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:16,949
I need some light
and air.

1390
01:39:17,017 --> 01:39:20,214
Why don't you take one of
your walks or your jog...

1391
01:39:20,287 --> 01:39:23,814
or whatever it is
you do?

1392
01:39:23,891 --> 01:39:26,792
There's no dinner
either!

1393
01:39:26,860 --> 01:39:31,297
Ed, you have any idea why I've
been goin' to all these classes?

1394
01:39:31,365 --> 01:39:34,892
<i>No. I've been trying
to save our marriage.</i>

1395
01:39:34,969 --> 01:39:36,994
What's the point
of my tryin'...

1396
01:39:37,071 --> 01:39:41,735
if you're gonna sit on
your butt drinking beer...

1397
01:39:41,809 --> 01:39:44,642
and watching baseball,
basketball, football...

1398
01:39:44,712 --> 01:39:47,840
bowling and hockey
and golf...

1399
01:39:47,915 --> 01:39:51,783
<i>and Challenge
of the Gladiators?</i>

1400
01:39:57,491 --> 01:40:02,019
<i>Mrs. Couch, I'm Sue,
Mrs. Otis'daughter-in-law.</i>

1401
01:40:02,096 --> 01:40:05,532
How are you? I've heard about
you from Mrs. Threadgoode.

1402
01:40:05,599 --> 01:40:09,296
She is so sweet. She's been
lookin' after my mother-in-law.

1403
01:40:09,370 --> 01:40:12,134
Now, how is Mrs. Otis doin', by the way?

1404
01:40:12,206 --> 01:40:16,666
Much better, thank you. It takes
time getting used to a strange place.

1405
01:40:16,744 --> 01:40:20,771
I'm glad to hear it. Mrs.
Threadgoode's been anxious to get home.

1406
01:40:20,848 --> 01:40:25,046
Mrs. Couch, Mrs. Threadgoode
doesn't have a house anymore.

1407
01:40:25,119 --> 01:40:28,577
They tore that down. What?

1408
01:40:28,655 --> 01:40:32,887
They had to. It was falling
apart, and it was condemned.

1409
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:35,895
Oh, no.

1410
01:40:35,963 --> 01:40:40,161
<i>Does she know that? No, well, we
didn't see any point in telling her.</i>

1411
01:40:40,234 --> 01:40:42,725
<i>It would just break her heart,
poor old thing.</i>

1412
01:40:42,803 --> 01:40:46,739
But I am so glad
I got a chance to meet you.

1413
01:40:46,807 --> 01:40:50,004
You take care of yourself now.
Bye-bye.

1414
01:41:59,980 --> 01:42:02,278
Oh, Evelyn, hey!

1415
01:42:02,349 --> 01:42:04,817
Hey.

1416
01:42:04,885 --> 01:42:07,251
Do you like
my roses?

1417
01:42:07,321 --> 01:42:10,654
Since I can't get home
to look at my own roses...

1418
01:42:10,724 --> 01:42:13,090
I made myself
a paper garden.

1419
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:16,652
<i>Got everything but the
bugs. They're lovely.</i>

1420
01:42:16,730 --> 01:42:19,995
You been here long?
Happy birthday!

1421
01:42:20,067 --> 01:42:22,558
Oh! I shouldn't have woken you up.

1422
01:42:22,636 --> 01:42:26,902
'Course you should've. Don't you never let
me sleep through a visitor's day, honey.

1423
01:42:26,974 --> 01:42:31,707
I look forward to them all
week. So do I, Mrs. Threadgoode.

1424
01:42:31,778 --> 01:42:35,111
[Gasp] Oh! I can't
believe you remembered.

1425
01:42:35,182 --> 01:42:39,380
You made me
fried green tomatoes!

1426
01:42:41,822 --> 01:42:43,847
Mmm!
They're delicious.

1427
01:42:43,924 --> 01:42:47,257
It's your recipe. Are they
cold? No. They're just the way...

1428
01:42:47,327 --> 01:42:51,593
we used to have 'em at
the Whistle Stop Cafe. Mmm!

1429
01:42:51,665 --> 01:42:55,601
You couldn't be sweeter to me
if you was my own daughter.

1430
01:42:55,669 --> 01:42:57,830
Here's your napkin.

1431
01:42:57,905 --> 01:42:59,930
And wait-wait-wait.

1432
01:43:00,007 --> 01:43:02,567
Queen, queen.

1433
01:43:05,746 --> 01:43:09,876
You know,
I don't feel 83.

1434
01:43:09,950 --> 01:43:14,080
It sorta slipped up on me.
[Whistle]

1435
01:43:16,190 --> 01:43:19,626
I never expected
to live this long.

1436
01:43:19,693 --> 01:43:25,290
'Course, the Lord takes us home
when he wants us.

1437
01:43:34,308 --> 01:43:37,937
Are you all right?

1438
01:43:38,011 --> 01:43:40,343
I was thinking
about Ruth.

1439
01:43:40,414 --> 01:43:43,212
After the trial
was over,

1440
01:43:43,283 --> 01:43:45,478
everything went back
to normal...

1441
01:43:45,552 --> 01:43:49,318
<i>till that fall
when Ruth lost her appetite.</i>

1442
01:43:49,389 --> 01:43:51,949
<i>By the time Doc Hadley
looked at her,</i>

1443
01:43:52,025 --> 01:43:56,223
<i>he said the cancer was so bad
she only had a couple of weeks.</i>

1444
01:43:56,296 --> 01:43:59,026
<i>Well, we moved her
to the Threadgoode house...</i>

1445
01:43:59,099 --> 01:44:03,934
<i>and put her downstairs
so she'd be more comfortable.</i>

1446
01:44:04,004 --> 01:44:08,498
<i>Sipsey moved in with her
and never left her side.</i>

1447
01:44:08,575 --> 01:44:10,702
<i>[Sipsey] Hold on, baby. I'm right here.</i>

1448
01:44:10,777 --> 01:44:15,441
<i>[Ninny] Idgie just prayed for a miracle.</i>

1449
01:44:34,735 --> 01:44:38,193
Now, listen to me.

1450
01:44:38,272 --> 01:44:40,797
Make sure he graduates.

1451
01:44:40,874 --> 01:44:45,072
And don't... let him
come to the funeral.

1452
01:44:45,145 --> 01:44:47,807
I don't want him going
through that mess.

1453
01:44:47,881 --> 01:44:51,180
Would you quit talkin'
like that?

1454
01:44:51,251 --> 01:44:53,742
What funeral?

1455
01:44:53,820 --> 01:44:56,186
You're gonna be back on
your feet feelin' just fine...

1456
01:44:56,256 --> 01:44:58,918
<i>in just a few days.</i>

1457
01:44:58,992 --> 01:45:01,893
<i>Just you wait.</i>

1458
01:45:01,962 --> 01:45:05,090
Oh, what's the matter,
son?

1459
01:45:10,937 --> 01:45:14,600
Well,
let's go for a walk.

1460
01:45:15,309 --> 01:45:16,901
<i>[Idgie] Did you get into a fight?</i>

1461
01:45:16,977 --> 01:45:19,673
I got punched
in the nose.

1462
01:45:19,746 --> 01:45:23,238
I can't play
like everyone else.

1463
01:45:23,317 --> 01:45:26,844
Did I ever tell you the
story about... the oysters?

1464
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:29,388
All the millions of'em
just lying around...

1465
01:45:29,456 --> 01:45:34,291
And God put sand in one of'em,
and it makes a pearl. Oh.

1466
01:45:36,063 --> 01:45:38,725
Did I ever tell you about
Eva's three-legged dog?

1467
01:45:38,799 --> 01:45:40,892
How it never felt sorry
for itself...

1468
01:45:40,967 --> 01:45:44,596
and how I ought to be smarter than a
dumb dog and not feel sorry for myself.

1469
01:45:46,406 --> 01:45:49,739
You listen to everything
I say, don't you?

1470
01:45:49,810 --> 01:45:52,779
You get real mad at me
when I don't.

1471
01:45:52,846 --> 01:45:54,541
Well,

1472
01:45:57,017 --> 01:46:00,009
you know about
your mama.

1473
01:46:00,087 --> 01:46:02,578
She's sick.

1474
01:46:02,656 --> 01:46:04,681
Mm-hmm.

1475
01:46:06,226 --> 01:46:09,662
See, now is the time
for courage.

1476
01:46:09,730 --> 01:46:13,427
<i>I guess you already know
that there are...</i>

1477
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:16,492
angels masqueradin' as people
walkin' around this planet,

1478
01:46:16,570 --> 01:46:19,733
and your mom's
the bravest one of those.

1479
01:46:24,010 --> 01:46:26,103
Come here.

1480
01:46:27,681 --> 01:46:29,740
<i>[Thunder]</i>

1481
01:46:33,820 --> 01:46:36,220
Mama, I can hit!
You should see me.

1482
01:46:36,289 --> 01:46:39,087
Idgie, she hit me in
the back with a curveball.

1483
01:46:39,159 --> 01:46:41,320
I didn't duck,
and I hardly cried.

1484
01:46:41,395 --> 01:46:44,853
She hit you?

1485
01:46:44,931 --> 01:46:48,924
Well, she did that
to me once too,

1486
01:46:49,002 --> 01:46:51,766
but I think
I did cry.

1487
01:46:53,673 --> 01:46:57,632
<i>Mama, I'm sorry
if you're sad.</i>

1488
01:46:57,711 --> 01:47:00,009
Well,

1489
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:03,174
give me a big kiss then,
and I'll never be sad again.

1490
01:47:10,724 --> 01:47:13,625
And you best not be sad
neither.

1491
01:47:13,693 --> 01:47:16,924
You understand?

1492
01:47:16,997 --> 01:47:18,931
You promise?

1493
01:47:18,999 --> 01:47:21,024
Promise.

1494
01:47:21,101 --> 01:47:25,037
Attaboy.
You go and wash up.

1495
01:47:29,042 --> 01:47:32,307
<i>[Gasping, Wheezing]</i>

1496
01:47:48,862 --> 01:47:50,887
Sweet baby.

1497
01:47:54,868 --> 01:47:58,133
You two
be alone now.

1498
01:47:58,839 --> 01:48:02,502
Hey, girl.

1499
01:48:05,011 --> 01:48:07,070
No.

1500
01:48:09,015 --> 01:48:12,075
That's nice.

1501
01:48:13,086 --> 01:48:16,783
Will you do one thing
for me?

1502
01:48:16,857 --> 01:48:20,452
Yeah, anything.
Be good to yourself.

1503
01:48:20,527 --> 01:48:23,462
Even...

1504
01:48:23,530 --> 01:48:26,055
settle down if
you can find someone...

1505
01:48:26,132 --> 01:48:28,862
who can beat you
in poker.

1506
01:48:36,576 --> 01:48:41,536
There's so many things
I want to say to you.

1507
01:48:41,615 --> 01:48:44,140
No.

1508
01:48:44,985 --> 01:48:47,647
I love your stories.

1509
01:48:47,721 --> 01:48:50,656
Tell me a story,
Idgie.

1510
01:48:53,527 --> 01:48:57,361
[Whispering]
Oh, God.

1511
01:48:57,430 --> 01:49:00,524
<i>Go on,
you old bee charmer.</i>

1512
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:04,263
<i>Tell me
a good tall tale.</i>

1513
01:49:05,672 --> 01:49:09,369
Tell me the one
about the lake.

1514
01:49:10,677 --> 01:49:15,307
What lake? The one...
that used to be here.

1515
01:49:17,450 --> 01:49:19,384
Oh.

1516
01:49:21,454 --> 01:49:25,015
Well, that was
just a lie.

1517
01:49:25,091 --> 01:49:27,855
I know that, fool.

1518
01:49:27,928 --> 01:49:29,987
Tell me anyway.

1519
01:49:30,063 --> 01:49:33,464
Tell me the story.

1520
01:49:35,035 --> 01:49:38,471
Well...

1521
01:49:40,507 --> 01:49:42,975
one time...

1522
01:49:43,043 --> 01:49:45,841
there was this lake.

1523
01:49:50,283 --> 01:49:54,652
And, uh, it was
right outside of town.

1524
01:49:54,721 --> 01:50:00,159
We used to go fishin' and
swimmin' and canoein' in it.

1525
01:50:00,226 --> 01:50:03,457
And see,
one November...

1526
01:50:03,530 --> 01:50:05,828
this big flock
of ducks...

1527
01:50:05,899 --> 01:50:10,927
came in and landed
on that lake and, uh,

1528
01:50:11,004 --> 01:50:15,839
and then the temperature dropped so fast
that the lake just froze right there.

1529
01:50:15,909 --> 01:50:18,173
And the, uh,

1530
01:50:18,244 --> 01:50:22,010
the ducks, they...

1531
01:50:22,082 --> 01:50:26,246
flew off, you see,
and took that lake with 'em.

1532
01:50:26,319 --> 01:50:29,550
And, uh,

1533
01:50:29,623 --> 01:50:34,617
now they say that lake is
somewhere over in Georgia.

1534
01:50:34,694 --> 01:50:37,754
Can you imagine?

1535
01:51:35,455 --> 01:51:38,720
It's all right,
honey.

1536
01:51:38,792 --> 01:51:44,761
Let her go.

1537
01:51:44,831 --> 01:51:49,063
You know,
Miss Ruth was a lady.

1538
01:51:49,135 --> 01:51:52,400
And a lady
always knows...

1539
01:51:52,472 --> 01:51:55,464
when to leave.

1540
01:51:55,542 --> 01:51:59,205
[Sigh]

1541
01:52:00,980 --> 01:52:05,076
<i>[Rev. Scroggins] When I think on
our departed sister, Ruth Jamison,</i>

1542
01:52:05,151 --> 01:52:08,245
<i>I'm reminded of our
Lord's Sermon on the Mount...</i>

1543
01:52:08,321 --> 01:52:10,789
<i>and how his teachings...</i>

1544
01:52:10,857 --> 01:52:15,294
<i>[Ninny] It's funny how
strong Ruth affected everyone,</i>

1545
01:52:15,361 --> 01:52:18,762
<i>even Smokey Lonesome.</i>

1546
01:52:18,832 --> 01:52:21,494
<i>When he died
a few years back...</i>

1547
01:52:21,568 --> 01:52:24,264
<i>he had one possession
on him,</i>

1548
01:52:24,337 --> 01:52:26,931
<i>a picture of Ruth.</i>

1549
01:52:28,308 --> 01:52:32,404
<i>He was in love with her
from the first time he saw her.</i>

1550
01:52:32,479 --> 01:52:35,346
<i>We all were.</i>

1551
01:52:41,321 --> 01:52:43,789
I shouldn't
a-told you this.

1552
01:52:45,725 --> 01:52:49,684
I hate death.
It scares me so.

1553
01:52:49,763 --> 01:52:52,288
Death is nothin'
to be afraid of!

1554
01:52:52,365 --> 01:52:55,425
Look at me. I'm at
the jumpin'-off place,

1555
01:52:55,502 --> 01:52:58,733
<i>and I ain't afraid
one bit.</i>

1556
01:52:58,805 --> 01:53:02,502
Oh, Ninny,
you're so brave.

1557
01:53:04,077 --> 01:53:08,013
Ruth and Idgie were brave,
not me.

1558
01:53:08,081 --> 01:53:11,448
I wouldn't be afraid
of death if I was you.

1559
01:53:11,518 --> 01:53:16,455
I'd be more afraid of driving
in rush-hour traffic.

1560
01:53:18,725 --> 01:53:23,662
Oh-oh-oh

1561
01:53:23,730 --> 01:53:26,563
Just listen to that rain

1562
01:53:26,633 --> 01:53:29,101
A-rainin' in the north

1563
01:53:29,169 --> 01:53:30,761
A-rainin' in the south

1564
01:53:30,837 --> 01:53:34,136
A-rainin' in the east

1565
01:53:34,207 --> 01:53:36,368
A-rainin' in the west

1566
01:53:36,442 --> 01:53:38,842
Ooh-ooh

1567
01:53:38,912 --> 01:53:42,439
Tell me didn't it rain
children

1568
01:53:42,515 --> 01:53:44,449
<i>Rain all night long</i>

1569
01:53:44,517 --> 01:53:46,678
<i>Didn't it
you know it did</i>

1570
01:53:46,753 --> 01:53:51,019
<i>I said, o my good Lord
didn't it rain</i>

1571
01:53:51,090 --> 01:53:54,526
Hey, it rained 40 days and
40 nights without stoppin'

1572
01:53:54,594 --> 01:53:56,994
Noah got worried
and the rain kept a-droppin'

1573
01:53:57,063 --> 01:53:59,463
He sent out a raven
Sent out a dove

1574
01:53:59,532 --> 01:54:01,830
The water, good God
came down from above

1575
01:54:01,901 --> 01:54:04,165
<i>They tell me my God
went and sent the rain</i>

1576
01:54:04,237 --> 01:54:06,671
The women and the children
did begin to scream

1577
01:54:06,739 --> 01:54:08,798
They knocked on the windows
and they batted at the doors

1578
01:54:08,875 --> 01:54:11,776
While they... Hoo, hoo
Take on more

1579
01:54:11,845 --> 01:54:14,109
<i>Noah said
No, no, my friend</i>

1580
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:16,307
<i>God said
I can't let you in</i>

1581
01:54:16,382 --> 01:54:19,010
Hoo, hoo

1582
01:54:19,085 --> 01:54:21,519
Listen to the rain

1583
01:54:21,588 --> 01:54:26,321
Uh-oh
Just listen to the rain

1584
01:54:26,392 --> 01:54:28,690
Listen to the rain

1585
01:54:28,761 --> 01:54:30,786
Just listen to the rain
Oh, oh

1586
01:54:30,864 --> 01:54:33,833
Listen, a-listen to the rain
Oh, oh, listen

1587
01:54:33,900 --> 01:54:36,266
Listen to the rain
Yeah, yeah, listen

1588
01:54:36,336 --> 01:54:38,770
Listen to the rain
Uh-oh, listen

1589
01:54:38,838 --> 01:54:41,329
<i>Listen to the rain
Yeah, yeah, listen</i>

1590
01:54:41,407 --> 01:54:45,867
<i>Last chance
Listen to the rain now</i>

1591
01:54:45,945 --> 01:54:48,539
<i>And then drip, drop
drip, drop</i>

1592
01:54:48,615 --> 01:54:52,745
Drip, drop drip,
drip, a-drop drip, drop

1593
01:54:53,419 --> 01:54:55,853
<i>Yeah, drip, drip, a-drop</i>

1594
01:54:55,922 --> 01:54:58,083
<i>Now, drip, drop</i>

1595
01:54:58,157 --> 01:55:01,957
<i>Drip, drip, a-drop</i>

1596
01:55:11,671 --> 01:55:14,663
Hi, honey.
Look what I got you.

1597
01:55:14,741 --> 01:55:16,766
Ah...

1598
01:55:16,843 --> 01:55:20,301
Ed, how sweet!

1599
01:55:20,380 --> 01:55:22,814
Lilies! My favorite. Yeah.

1600
01:55:22,882 --> 01:55:26,010
I know.
Sometimes I even amaze myself.

1601
01:55:26,085 --> 01:55:30,181
What's the occasion?
Oh, honey, I just...

1602
01:55:30,256 --> 01:55:33,225
feel sorry about
the past few months.

1603
01:55:33,293 --> 01:55:37,286
I don't know what you're really
up to and what's going on with you,

1604
01:55:37,363 --> 01:55:41,766
but I guess I could've been more helpful
with your job and everything, you know.

1605
01:55:43,002 --> 01:55:44,867
Well, why are you...

1606
01:55:44,938 --> 01:55:47,907
puttin' up this wall
where you just tore one down?

1607
01:55:47,974 --> 01:55:51,102
Well...
I changed my mind.

1608
01:55:51,177 --> 01:55:53,941
I don't mean to seem
dense or anything,

1609
01:55:54,013 --> 01:55:58,245
but what's changed?
The air and the light.

1610
01:56:00,620 --> 01:56:03,214
Ed...
Hmm?

1611
01:56:03,289 --> 01:56:05,757
You remember how
you used to tell me...

1612
01:56:05,825 --> 01:56:08,555
you always wanted
two women in your house?

1613
01:56:08,628 --> 01:56:10,926
[Laughing]
Oh, God.

1614
01:56:10,997 --> 01:56:12,658
Yeah.

1615
01:56:12,732 --> 01:56:14,757
Well...

1616
01:56:14,834 --> 01:56:17,769
what if I was
the younger of the two?

1617
01:56:17,837 --> 01:56:21,364
I don't believe
I get your drift.

1618
01:56:21,441 --> 01:56:25,969
I want something more than I've
ever wanted anything before.

1619
01:56:26,045 --> 01:56:28,809
I want to bring
Mrs. Threadgoode...

1620
01:56:28,881 --> 01:56:31,076
to our home.

1621
01:56:31,150 --> 01:56:33,778
I want her
to live here with us.

1622
01:56:33,853 --> 01:56:36,344
I want to give her the love
she's given me.

1623
01:56:36,422 --> 01:56:40,586
[Snicker] You're kiddin' me,
aren't you? I'm absolutely serious.

1624
01:56:40,660 --> 01:56:45,495
That's why I'm puttin' the
wall to Kyle's room back up.

1625
01:56:45,565 --> 01:56:48,625
Well, honey, this isn't
something you're just go and do.

1626
01:56:48,701 --> 01:56:51,363
I mean,
she's an old woman.

1627
01:56:51,437 --> 01:56:54,668
What if she got sick?
Who's gonna take care of her?

1628
01:56:54,741 --> 01:56:56,436
I will!

1629
01:56:56,509 --> 01:56:58,500
I can't leave her
in that place.

1630
01:56:58,578 --> 01:57:02,480
She's not a stray cat.
Hell, she isn't even family.

1631
01:57:02,548 --> 01:57:05,608
She's family to me.
Now, Evelyn.

1632
01:57:06,452 --> 01:57:09,512
<i>Evelyn?</i>

1633
01:57:09,589 --> 01:57:11,454
<i>Honey?</i>

1634
01:57:11,524 --> 01:57:13,515
<i>Ah, look...</i>

1635
01:57:13,593 --> 01:57:17,825
have you mentioned this
harebrained idea to her?

1636
01:57:17,897 --> 01:57:20,957
Not yet.
Well, good!

1637
01:57:21,034 --> 01:57:23,502
Then we'll just pretend
it never happened.

1638
01:57:23,569 --> 01:57:26,595
I'm making my own money.
I'll pay for everything.

1639
01:57:26,672 --> 01:57:30,233
You don't have to do
a thing.

1640
01:57:30,309 --> 01:57:32,800
Evelyn...

1641
01:57:32,879 --> 01:57:35,347
it's never
gonna happen.

1642
01:57:35,415 --> 01:57:38,077
So just forget
about it.

1643
01:57:39,685 --> 01:57:42,449
Don't you ever
say "never" to me.

1644
01:57:51,397 --> 01:57:54,195
Someone helped put a mirror
up in front of my face,

1645
01:57:54,267 --> 01:57:56,861
and I didn't like
what I saw one bit.

1646
01:57:56,936 --> 01:58:00,770
You know what I did?
I changed.

1647
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:04,742
And that someone...
was Mrs. Threadgoode.

1648
01:58:04,811 --> 01:58:09,305
She needs my love and care,
and I'm gonna give it to her.

1649
01:58:11,084 --> 01:58:14,713
If you'll excuse me,
I have to go to the gym.

1650
01:58:19,659 --> 01:58:22,685
And if you won't listen
to reason...

1651
01:58:22,762 --> 01:58:26,391
there's always Towanda.

1652
01:58:41,180 --> 01:58:44,149
Hey, Nin...

1653
01:58:46,819 --> 01:58:49,845
What are you doing?

1654
01:58:49,922 --> 01:58:52,652
Those are her things,
Mrs. Threadgoode's things!

1655
01:58:52,725 --> 01:58:55,819
What are you doing in here?
Where's Mrs. Threadgoode? Who?

1656
01:58:55,895 --> 01:58:58,728
Mrs. Threadgoode! The woman
who lives here. Are you deaf?

1657
01:58:58,798 --> 01:59:01,699
I'm sorry, miss.
All they told me...

1658
01:59:01,767 --> 01:59:05,965
was that the woman who lived
in here died this morning.

1659
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:09,967
Oh, my God!

1660
01:59:10,042 --> 01:59:14,376
Wha... What
are you sayin'?

1661
01:59:14,447 --> 01:59:16,608
<i>She died early
this morning.</i>

1662
01:59:16,682 --> 01:59:21,016
<i>They were shorthanded so they asked
me to take all this stuff down.</i>

1663
01:59:21,087 --> 01:59:23,578
<i>That's all I know.</i>

1664
01:59:42,975 --> 01:59:44,909
Stop that!

1665
01:59:44,977 --> 01:59:47,343
What is the matter
with you people?

1666
01:59:47,413 --> 01:59:50,348
Can't you wait a goddamn day,
for Chrissake?

1667
01:59:50,416 --> 01:59:53,408
Do you have no respect?
These are her things!

1668
01:59:53,486 --> 01:59:57,650
I'm sorry, but they told me to get
this room ready for another patient.

1669
01:59:57,723 --> 02:00:00,920
She may be just
another patient to you,

1670
02:00:00,993 --> 02:00:05,089
but she was my friend,
and I loved her. I'm sorry.

1671
02:00:05,164 --> 02:00:07,098
I'm just
following orders.

1672
02:00:07,166 --> 02:00:10,101
What is going on? Why
didn't you call me?

1673
02:00:10,169 --> 02:00:13,502
You could've called me before
you sent that idiot... I'm sorry.

1674
02:00:13,573 --> 02:00:16,235
It never occurred to me that
you would take it this hard.

1675
02:00:16,309 --> 02:00:19,938
I didn't even get to tell
her good-bye. Oh, I know.

1676
02:00:20,012 --> 02:00:23,971
These things are difficult, but
she died peacefully in her sleep.

1677
02:00:24,050 --> 02:00:27,315
To tell you the truth, I thought
you'd be happy for Mrs. Threadgoode.

1678
02:00:27,386 --> 02:00:30,412
Happy? Why, yes! This
is what she wanted.

1679
02:00:30,489 --> 02:00:32,423
What?
To be dead?

1680
02:00:32,491 --> 02:00:35,016
No, to go home.
You just missed her.

1681
02:00:35,094 --> 02:00:37,528
She left in a yellow cab
about a half hour ago.

1682
02:00:37,597 --> 02:00:40,293
I don't understand.
What? A cab?

1683
02:00:40,366 --> 02:00:44,632
She said there wasn't no reason for
her to stay now that Mrs. Otis had died.

1684
02:00:44,704 --> 02:00:47,332
Mrs...

1685
02:00:47,406 --> 02:00:49,567
Otis is dead?

1686
02:00:49,642 --> 02:00:53,510
Oh, Mrs. Otis died.

1687
02:00:53,579 --> 02:00:55,570
Mrs. Otis died!

1688
02:00:55,648 --> 02:00:58,845
Mrs. Otis!
Oh, God!

1689
02:00:58,918 --> 02:01:02,945
Not that... I'm glad that
Mrs. Otis died, it's just...

1690
02:01:03,022 --> 02:01:05,650
Oh, God,
I've gotta stop her.

1691
02:01:45,097 --> 02:01:48,328
Hey, Evelyn,
somebody stole my house.

1692
02:01:48,401 --> 02:01:51,302
It was right here
when I left.

1693
02:01:51,370 --> 02:01:56,137
Unless... Oh, Evelyn, you
don't reckon I'm crazy, do you?

1694
02:01:56,208 --> 02:02:00,406
It was here when I left.
No, honey, you're not crazy.

1695
02:02:00,479 --> 02:02:03,243
This is the place.

1696
02:02:03,316 --> 02:02:07,343
Why would anyone want to
steal an old lady's home?

1697
02:02:07,420 --> 02:02:09,547
Wasn't worth nothin'.

1698
02:02:09,622 --> 02:02:13,023
Oh, honey,
nobody stole it.

1699
02:02:13,092 --> 02:02:16,960
They had to tear it down.
It was condemned.

1700
02:02:17,029 --> 02:02:19,156
I'm sorry.
I shoulda told you.

1701
02:02:19,231 --> 02:02:22,496
Well, somebody
shoulda told me.

1702
02:02:22,568 --> 02:02:27,403
I'm old. I'm not a child. I'm sorry.

1703
02:02:27,473 --> 02:02:30,806
My husband Cleo and I
lived in this house...

1704
02:02:30,876 --> 02:02:33,367
for more than 40 years.

1705
02:02:33,446 --> 02:02:36,847
Now, it's... it's gone.

1706
02:02:36,916 --> 02:02:40,477
83 years worth of livin'
and all that's left of me...

1707
02:02:40,553 --> 02:02:44,580
is what's in this box, a
bunch of old cards and pictures.

1708
02:02:44,657 --> 02:02:47,125
Come on.
I'll take you home.

1709
02:02:47,193 --> 02:02:49,320
This is my home!

1710
02:02:49,395 --> 02:02:51,386
And now it's gone.

1711
02:02:51,464 --> 02:02:53,989
And Mrs. Otis
is gone.

1712
02:02:54,066 --> 02:02:56,159
I...

1713
02:02:56,235 --> 02:02:58,829
I don't quite
know what to do.

1714
02:02:58,904 --> 02:03:02,738
This is the first time I can remember
when I don't have a soul to look after.

1715
02:03:02,808 --> 02:03:05,174
You can come
look after me and Ed.

1716
02:03:05,244 --> 02:03:07,542
Oh, you're sweet,

1717
02:03:07,613 --> 02:03:10,411
but I think you're doin'
just fine on your own.

1718
02:03:10,483 --> 02:03:14,783
Don't you know you'd be
like a gift for us?

1719
02:03:14,854 --> 02:03:18,017
You're the reason
I get up every morning...

1720
02:03:18,090 --> 02:03:21,423
and that Mary Kay's
havin' such a good year...

1721
02:03:21,494 --> 02:03:26,056
and I don't look like some
blob from a horror movie.

1722
02:03:26,132 --> 02:03:30,159
Well, with a little help
from Idgie and Ruth.

1723
02:03:31,737 --> 02:03:34,262
Come on. I've got
your room all ready.

1724
02:03:34,340 --> 02:03:36,740
What does Ed say
about all this?

1725
02:03:36,809 --> 02:03:40,643
He'll learn
to love it.

1726
02:03:44,116 --> 02:03:48,246
Did I ever tell you that Mrs.
Otis was Sipsey's baby sister?

1727
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:50,982
No, ma'am.
Yes, she was.

1728
02:03:51,056 --> 02:03:54,924
Mrs. Otis was with Sipsey
and me the night Sipsey died.

1729
02:03:54,994 --> 02:04:00,159
Sipsey told me a story that night
I've never told a living soul, Evelyn.

1730
02:04:00,232 --> 02:04:03,360
<i>A story about
what really happened...</i>

1731
02:04:03,436 --> 02:04:06,769
<i>the night Frank Bennett
disappeared.</i>

1732
02:04:31,063 --> 02:04:33,497
<i>[Applause, Whistling]</i>

1733
02:04:39,338 --> 02:04:42,865
Hey there! You got to come quick.

1734
02:04:42,942 --> 02:04:47,902
The show has hardly begun. You
got to come quick. You hear me?

1735
02:04:53,819 --> 02:04:56,413
Run, get help! Run,
quick! Where's the baby?

1736
02:04:56,489 --> 02:04:58,286
Never mind.

1737
02:05:00,526 --> 02:05:02,653

1738
02:05:05,931 --> 02:05:08,866

1739
02:05:17,009 --> 02:05:18,670
Excuse me, sir.

1740
02:05:18,744 --> 02:05:24,239
I don't believe you should be
goin' anywhere with Ruth's baby.

1741
02:05:24,316 --> 02:05:27,080
<i>[Crying]</i>

1742
02:05:35,895 --> 02:05:38,625
Like I said,
you ain't goin' nowhere.

1743
02:05:38,697 --> 02:05:41,257
Damn, you a thickheaded
son-of-a-bitch, ain't you?

1744
02:05:45,471 --> 02:05:47,439
<i>I told you...</i>

1745
02:05:47,506 --> 02:05:51,943
you ain't goin' nowheres
with Miss Ruth's baby.

1746
02:05:52,011 --> 02:05:54,036
<i>[Crying]</i>

1747
02:05:57,583 --> 02:05:59,778
Come on, angel.
Come on.

1748
02:05:59,852 --> 02:06:03,686
Come on, sweetheart.
It's all right.

1749
02:06:03,756 --> 02:06:06,247
Come on.
It's all right, baby.

1750
02:06:09,161 --> 02:06:11,891
<i>[Idgie]
It was self-defense.</i>

1751
02:06:11,964 --> 02:06:16,799
I don't know why any white
jury would care why I did it.

1752
02:06:16,869 --> 02:06:19,667
Well, I saw it, and I can
testify. Excuse me here.

1753
02:06:19,738 --> 02:06:21,899
I don't mean
no offense here,

1754
02:06:21,974 --> 02:06:25,034
but I don't know who's less
likely to convince a jury,

1755
02:06:25,110 --> 02:06:27,374
my mama...
or Mr. Smokey.

1756
02:06:27,446 --> 02:06:30,244
No offense taken.

1757
02:06:30,316 --> 02:06:32,716
You're a good man,
Mr. Smokey.

1758
02:06:32,785 --> 02:06:36,812
You did good.
The sun's almost up.

1759
02:06:40,359 --> 02:06:43,726
George?
Mm-hmm?

1760
02:06:43,796 --> 02:06:46,560
I think...

1761
02:06:46,632 --> 02:06:50,159
it's hog-boiling time.

1762
02:06:50,235 --> 02:06:52,499
No, ma'am. It
ain't cold enough.

1763
02:06:52,571 --> 02:06:55,335
It's hog-boiling time.

1764
02:06:58,277 --> 02:07:00,211
<i>Big George?</i>

1765
02:07:00,279 --> 02:07:03,373
Uh-huh? When is that
barbecue gonna be ready?

1766
02:07:03,449 --> 02:07:05,781
It's gonna be ready
any time now.

1767
02:07:05,851 --> 02:07:10,754
Smells so damn good I just
can't wait to get me some.

1768
02:07:10,823 --> 02:07:15,123
Now, don't you forget to call
me when that's ready. All right.

1769
02:07:28,874 --> 02:07:31,138
Here you go.

1770
02:07:32,711 --> 02:07:36,340
Miss Idgie? Smokey left town. Yeah?

1771
02:07:36,415 --> 02:07:40,408
I thought it'd be best
under the circumstances.

1772
02:07:40,486 --> 02:07:44,445
He asked that
you tell Ruth good-bye.

1773
02:07:44,523 --> 02:07:46,991
Shame he had to go.

1774
02:07:53,966 --> 02:07:58,869
<i>[Knocking]
Hold on! I'm comin'.</i>

1775
02:08:03,742 --> 02:08:06,506
What you want?
We want some barbecue.

1776
02:08:06,578 --> 02:08:10,275
Not today you don't.
Go on.

1777
02:08:23,328 --> 02:08:26,456
Why, this is about the
best barbecue I ever ate!

1778
02:08:27,966 --> 02:08:31,458
The secret's
in the sauce.

1779
02:08:40,245 --> 02:08:44,113
Sipsey?
My God!

1780
02:08:44,183 --> 02:08:48,517
That fryin' pan did more
than fry chicken that night.

1781
02:08:50,289 --> 02:08:54,749
Did Idgie really barbecue Frank
Bennett? Are you pullin' my leg?

1782
02:08:54,827 --> 02:08:58,524
Secret's in the sauce,
or so I've been told.

1783
02:09:02,034 --> 02:09:05,868
Now you know why
Idgie had to go on trial.

1784
02:09:05,938 --> 02:09:09,567
She knew the law would never
believe Sipsey. No!

1785
02:09:09,641 --> 02:09:12,132
Sipsey or Big George
or anyone else of color...

1786
02:09:12,211 --> 02:09:15,669
would've been hangin'
from the nearest tree.

1787
02:09:15,748 --> 02:09:18,012
To this day,
I'm still not sure...

1788
02:09:18,083 --> 02:09:20,643
whether Ruth
ever believed...

1789
02:09:20,719 --> 02:09:24,849
that Idgie didn't kill
Frank Bennett.

1790
02:09:24,923 --> 02:09:29,155
Truth's a funny thing
sometimes.

1791
02:09:29,228 --> 02:09:33,187
I feel better now.
Good.

1792
02:09:33,265 --> 02:09:36,564
I feel better 'cause
all these people'll live...

1793
02:09:36,635 --> 02:09:39,695
as long as
you remember 'em.

1794
02:09:39,772 --> 02:09:41,706
You reminded me...

1795
02:09:41,774 --> 02:09:45,175
about what the most
important thing in life is.

1796
02:09:45,244 --> 02:09:47,576
Do you know what I
think it is? No, ma'am.

1797
02:09:47,646 --> 02:09:50,911

Best friends.

02:09:55,187 --> 02:09:56,916

02:10:02,194 --> 02:10:04,025
Oh!

1801
02:10:23,248 --> 02:10:25,182
Idgie?

1802
02:10:28,654 --> 02:10:32,522
<i>Idgie's alive?
Oh, yes!</i>

1803
02:10:32,591 --> 02:10:36,857
She's still out and about
charmin' bees and selling honey.

1804
02:10:36,929 --> 02:10:40,888
Sometimes I think
I catch a glimpse of her.

1805
02:10:46,805 --> 02:10:49,239
Maybe we'll
see her today.

1806
02:10:49,308 --> 02:10:51,936
Maybe.

1807
02:10:53,612 --> 02:10:56,308

1813
02:11:26,178 --> 02:11:30,274
<i>the heart of the town

02:13:19,992 --> 02:13:23,985
<i>Now listen
didn't I</i>

1828
02:13:24,062 --> 02:13:28,089
<i>Didn't I love you</i>

1829
02:13:28,166 --> 02:13:34,537
<i>Didn't I
didn't I care</i>

1830
02:13:34,606 --> 02:13:40,567
<i>Didn't I sleep
and didn't I weep beside you</i>

1831
02:13:40,645 --> 02:13:45,981
<i>With the rain that
was blowing in your hair</i>

1832
02:13:46,051 --> 02:13:48,110
<i>Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh</i>

1833
02:13:49,221 --> 02:13:52,156
<i>I'll remember you</i>

1834
02:13:53,425 --> 02:13:55,655
<i>When the wind blows</i>

1835
02:13:55,727 --> 02:13:59,823
<i>On through
the piney wood</i>

1836
02:14:01,266 --> 02:14:07,671
<i>It was you who came
right through for me, baby</i>

1837
02:14:07,739 --> 02:14:11,368
<i>It was you
who understood</i>

1838
02:14:12,511 --> 02:14:15,742
<i>Though I'd never say</i>

1839
02:14:15,814 --> 02:14:20,683
<i>That I turned the way</i>

1840
02:14:20,752 --> 02:14:25,314
<i>That you
have led me to</i>

1841
02:14:25,390 --> 02:14:29,326
<i>Darling, in the end</i>

1842
02:14:29,394 --> 02:14:33,524
<i>My dear sweet friend</i>

1843
02:14:33,598 --> 02:14:36,897
<i>I'll remember you</i>

1844
02:14:36,968 --> 02:14:40,563
<i>Yes, I will now</i>

<i>I'll remember</i>

<i>I will remember you
Yes, I will</i>

1850
02:15:04,830 --> 02:15:08,664
<i>Time ain't gonna
change nothin', baby</i>

1851
02:15:08,733 --> 02:15:11,964
<i>We can be halfway across
the world from each other</i>

1852
02:15:12,037 --> 02:15:15,268
<i>Don't make no difference</i>

1853
02:15:15,340 --> 02:15:21,671
<i>I'll remember</i>

1854
02:15:21,746 --> 02:15:24,840
<i>Every hour, every second</i>

1855
02:15:24,916 --> 02:15:28,750
<i>Every moment
that we had</i>

1856
02:15:28,820 --> 02:15:31,914
<i>We do it, we do it</i>

1857
02:15:31,990 --> 02:15:35,084
<i>We do it
don't do it</i>

1858
02:15:35,160 --> 02:15:40,188
<i>Gonna do it, do it
do it, do it, do it</i>

1859
02:15:41,533 --> 02:15:44,730
<i>I'll remember,
I'll remember</i>

1860
02:15:44,803 --> 02:15:48,000
<i>Oh, I'll remember you</i>

1861
02:15:48,073 --> 02:15:53,204
<i>I'll remember you</i>

1862
02:15:57,616 --> 02:16:00,176
<i>I'll remember you</i>
