1
00:01:56,461 --> 00:01:58,861
This has been
a long time coming, fellas.

2
00:01:59,064 --> 00:02:00,827
Three years on the plates alone.

3
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:03,297
But you'll find the product
worth the wait.

4
00:02:03,502 --> 00:02:05,834
Go ahead. Take a good look, boys.

5
00:02:07,472 --> 00:02:09,838
Jeez, Mr. Sol, I can't tell
the difference.

6
00:02:10,042 --> 00:02:14,706
You'd need a neutron microscope.
Identical, to Ben Franklin's stubble.

7
00:02:14,913 --> 00:02:18,474
I want half a mil a week laundered in
the casino. 3/4 mil by March.

8
00:02:18,717 --> 00:02:20,742
Anybody got a problem with that?

9
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,617
The Bat!

10
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,918
Get him!

11
00:03:05,964 --> 00:03:07,898
Chuckie Sol.

12
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:08,828
Batman!

13
00:03:09,034 --> 00:03:10,501
How'd you get here?

14
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:19,435
Your Angel of Death awaits.

15
00:03:19,644 --> 00:03:20,872
You ain't the Bat!

16
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:26,881
Who are you? What do you want?

17
00:03:27,853 --> 00:03:30,413
I want you, Chuckie-boy.

18
00:04:12,664 --> 00:04:15,724
This time I got you,
you lousy, stinking...

19
00:04:16,334 --> 00:04:17,562
What...?!

20
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,046
- Look!
- Good Lord!

21
00:04:36,254 --> 00:04:39,246
- What happened?
- Hey, look! It's Batman!

22
00:05:01,513 --> 00:05:04,744
I'm telling you, it's vigilantism
at its deadliest.

23
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:08,579
How many times are we gonna let
Batman cross the line?

24
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,013
Councilman, you can't blame Batman
for what happened to Chuckie Sol.

25
00:05:13,225 --> 00:05:15,853
Why not?
He's a loose cannon, commissioner.

26
00:05:16,061 --> 00:05:20,020
It's not just my opinion. A lot of
people, including the police...

27
00:05:20,232 --> 00:05:22,723
...think Batman's as unstable
as the crooks.

28
00:05:22,934 --> 00:05:25,903
What kind of city are we running...

29
00:05:26,104 --> 00:05:29,301
<i>... - when we depend on the support</i>
<i>of a potential madman?!</i>

30
00:05:31,376 --> 00:05:35,107
Such rot, sir. Why, you're
the very model of sanity.

31
00:05:35,847 --> 00:05:39,783
By the way, I pressed your tights and
put away your exploding gas balls.

32
00:05:39,985 --> 00:05:41,646
Thank you, Alfred.

33
00:05:42,921 --> 00:05:45,321
Might one inquire what this is?

34
00:05:45,523 --> 00:05:48,981
A piece of windshield
from Chuckie Sol's car.

35
00:05:52,063 --> 00:05:53,894
There's a chemical residue on it.

36
00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:58,866
A dense, long-chain macromolecular
polymer. Adaptogenic, of course.

37
00:05:59,337 --> 00:06:00,668
Of course.

38
00:06:04,743 --> 00:06:06,734
I should be landing any minute.

39
00:06:06,945 --> 00:06:09,345
- It'll be good to see you again.
<i>- You too-</i>

40
00:06:09,547 --> 00:06:13,483
And don't worry about a thing. We'll
clear up these old family finances.

41
00:06:13,685 --> 00:06:14,549
Don't forget...

42
00:06:14,753 --> 00:06:17,415
...you've got a bigtime councilman
on your side.

43
00:06:17,622 --> 00:06:19,852
I can't believe it's been 10 years.

44
00:06:20,058 --> 00:06:22,925
Thinking of looking up some old friends?

45
00:06:23,461 --> 00:06:25,588
Arthur, don't start that again.

46
00:06:27,198 --> 00:06:28,756
He's ancient history.

47
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,067
That's encouraging. I'll see you soon.

48
00:06:50,155 --> 00:06:53,613
Oh, come on, Bruce! All alone
in this big mansion...

49
00:06:54,292 --> 00:06:57,728
Haven't you ever thought about marriage,
even once?

50
00:06:57,929 --> 00:07:02,263
Never say the "M" word in front of
Bruce. It makes him nervous.

51
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,092
What about the "l" word?

52
00:07:04,602 --> 00:07:05,728
The "l" word?

53
00:07:05,937 --> 00:07:07,564
"Ingagement."

54
00:07:08,239 --> 00:07:10,833
I'd watch out for Brucie
if I were you, girls.

55
00:07:11,309 --> 00:07:16,076
He makes you think you're the only woman
he's ever been interested in.

56
00:07:16,715 --> 00:07:20,048
And just when you're wondering where to
register the china...

57
00:07:20,251 --> 00:07:22,412
...he forgets your phone number.

58
00:07:23,655 --> 00:07:25,850
That's Bruce Wayne's style.

59
00:07:26,257 --> 00:07:27,121
Bruce?

60
00:07:27,492 --> 00:07:28,823
Excuse me.

61
00:07:32,664 --> 00:07:33,892
Friend in need?

62
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,259
Councilman.
So how goes the Bat bashing?

63
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:39,634
Better than your love life.

64
00:07:39,938 --> 00:07:44,272
You seem to pick them knowing there's no
chance for a serious relationship.

65
00:07:44,476 --> 00:07:47,377
Since that one girl. What was her name?

66
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:49,945
Anne? Andi? Andrea?

67
00:07:50,448 --> 00:07:52,348
Yes, Andrea Beaumont!

68
00:07:52,684 --> 00:07:54,379
There was a sweet number.

69
00:07:54,652 --> 00:07:56,449
How'd you let her get loose?

70
00:07:56,654 --> 00:07:58,781
Thanks for the handkerchief, Arthur.

71
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,151
You know where you can stick it.

72
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:11,134
<i>Andrea...</i>

73
00:08:42,967 --> 00:08:47,904
If Daddy gets any more protective,
he'll build a moat around my bedroom.

74
00:08:49,741 --> 00:08:52,039
Times like this
I wish you were around to...

75
00:08:53,578 --> 00:08:57,912
Excuse me. I thought you were
saying something. To me, I mean.

76
00:09:03,855 --> 00:09:04,981
Know who that was?

77
00:09:05,223 --> 00:09:08,317
Bruce Wayne. You know,
Wayne Enterprises?

78
00:09:08,726 --> 00:09:12,423
I've seen him on campus. Very moody.
Cute, though.

79
00:09:13,531 --> 00:09:15,965
- Yes?
- I heard my name. I thought...

80
00:09:16,668 --> 00:09:18,898
- Who are you talking to?
- My mother.

81
00:09:20,772 --> 00:09:22,501
Oh. I didn't mean to...

82
00:09:22,707 --> 00:09:26,768
That's okay. We're done.
Mom doesn't have much to say today.

83
00:09:27,979 --> 00:09:31,107
I'm not the only one
who talks to their loved ones.

84
00:09:31,316 --> 00:09:32,749
I didn't say anything.

85
00:09:38,022 --> 00:09:42,356
When I talk to her out loud,
I can imagine how she'd reply.

86
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,958
I can hear her, like she's right there.

87
00:09:45,763 --> 00:09:47,458
I talked to my parents.

88
00:09:47,665 --> 00:09:48,723
What did you say?

89
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:51,128
- I made a vow.
- What vow?

90
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,167
A secret one.

91
00:09:53,371 --> 00:09:55,305
A man of mystery!

92
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,603
Have you kept your vow?

93
00:09:58,343 --> 00:09:59,810
So far.

94
00:10:04,382 --> 00:10:06,077
Andrea Beaumont.

95
00:10:06,317 --> 00:10:07,113
Bruce Wayne.

96
00:10:07,318 --> 00:10:09,252
I know. "The boy billionaire."

97
00:10:09,454 --> 00:10:13,982
With all that money, why do you always
look like you want to jump off a cliff?

98
00:10:14,492 --> 00:10:16,722
- Why should you care?
- I don't.

99
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,991
Mother was asking.

100
00:10:45,256 --> 00:10:48,248
Let's step on it!
We ain't got all night.

101
00:10:52,864 --> 00:10:54,354
Wait for me!

102
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,897
Coming through.

103
00:10:57,101 --> 00:10:59,661
Okay, Skaz. We're done shopping.

104
00:11:00,672 --> 00:11:01,969
All clear here.

105
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,900
Well, Bruce, here goes.

106
00:11:05,944 --> 00:11:08,003
Let's blow this pop stand.

107
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,484
On your stomachs, arms spread!

108
00:11:14,686 --> 00:11:15,653
Who's this clown?

109
00:11:15,853 --> 00:11:16,751
You heard me!

110
00:11:16,955 --> 00:11:19,355
Yeah, you heard him, boys.

111
00:11:19,557 --> 00:11:21,957
You heard Mr. Kung Fu.

112
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,628
- I'm shaking.
- Say your prayers, sucker!

113
00:11:46,718 --> 00:11:47,946
Yes...!

114
00:11:56,127 --> 00:11:57,492
Excuse me.

115
00:12:26,858 --> 00:12:27,688
Hey, Jonesey!

116
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:29,517
There!

117
00:14:03,321 --> 00:14:06,916
I read about your anonymous exploits,
and I must say...

118
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,855
...are you sure you won't
reconsider rugby?

119
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:12,996
Sorry, Alfred, but the plan is working.

120
00:14:13,431 --> 00:14:15,729
I had the edge. I could feel it!

121
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,792
There was only one thing wrong.

122
00:14:18,002 --> 00:14:19,469
They weren't afraid of me.

123
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,797
I've got to strike fear in them.

124
00:14:22,006 --> 00:14:25,806
Pardon, Master Bruce. We may want
to postpone the shoptalk.

125
00:14:26,277 --> 00:14:28,108
I believe you have a visitor.

126
00:14:28,312 --> 00:14:32,749
Hi! Hey, what happened to you?
Trip over some loose cash?

127
00:14:33,084 --> 00:14:37,851
It's been 3 days since we met, and still
no calls. I figured you must be dead.

128
00:14:38,055 --> 00:14:40,455
You expect every guy you meet
to call you?

129
00:14:40,658 --> 00:14:43,126
The ones that are smart enough
to dial a phone.

130
00:14:44,195 --> 00:14:46,186
- What is that?
- Jujitsu.

131
00:14:46,397 --> 00:14:47,295
Gesundheit.

132
00:14:48,766 --> 00:14:49,824
That was a joke.

133
00:14:50,034 --> 00:14:51,501
Jujitsu is no joke.

134
00:14:51,702 --> 00:14:53,602
It takes years to master.

135
00:14:57,308 --> 00:14:59,742
Got a few moves of my own.

136
00:14:59,944 --> 00:15:02,378
Miss Hovey's self-defense class
for girls.

137
00:15:03,948 --> 00:15:05,313
Oh, he laughs!

138
00:15:12,457 --> 00:15:15,119
Nice footwork. Can you dance too?

139
00:15:34,445 --> 00:15:38,006
Pardon, sir, but Miss Bambi
is dancing on the piano.

140
00:15:38,216 --> 00:15:41,481
Brucie! Where are you?

141
00:16:11,816 --> 00:16:13,010
You guys wait here.

142
00:16:13,351 --> 00:16:15,080
Whatever you say, Mr. Bronski.

143
00:16:19,957 --> 00:16:22,152
They say the Bat iced this guy.

144
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,486
I know.

145
00:16:33,304 --> 00:16:35,704
Chuckie, Chuckie...

146
00:16:37,508 --> 00:16:39,408
You always were a loser.

147
00:16:40,344 --> 00:16:41,641
Buzz...

148
00:16:43,247 --> 00:16:44,236
Who's there?

149
00:16:55,226 --> 00:16:56,955
Buzz Bronski.

150
00:16:57,828 --> 00:17:00,262
Your Angel of Death awaits.

151
00:17:00,631 --> 00:17:01,996
Get away, you freak!

152
00:17:26,223 --> 00:17:29,124
Time to pay for your sins, Mr. Bronski.

153
00:17:43,374 --> 00:17:45,672
All right, creep. Catch this!

154
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,472
What the...?

155
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,115
Jake! Dougan!

156
00:17:56,487 --> 00:17:57,818
Boys!

157
00:17:58,055 --> 00:17:59,283
Come on!

158
00:18:03,194 --> 00:18:04,718
He was up here!

159
00:18:05,062 --> 00:18:06,723
Boss! Boss!

160
00:18:09,967 --> 00:18:11,628
Boys! Hurry!

161
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:29,115
You always were a loser, Mr. Bronski.

162
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,620
Farewell, Mr. Bronski!

163
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:03,946
Oh, man!

164
00:19:08,793 --> 00:19:09,725
It's the Bat!

165
00:19:13,164 --> 00:19:14,756
It's the stinking Bat!

166
00:19:34,051 --> 00:19:34,915
Buzz!

167
00:19:56,173 --> 00:19:58,641
What do you mean?
You have to go after him!

168
00:19:58,843 --> 00:20:00,367
He didn't do it!

169
00:20:00,578 --> 00:20:04,105
It's garbage, Mr. Reeves.
Batman does not kill. Period!

170
00:20:06,016 --> 00:20:08,849
You want him, you get him.
I'll have no part of it.

171
00:20:09,787 --> 00:20:11,186
Well, gentlemen?

172
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,314
Any ideas?

173
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:24,426
He's usually here by now.

174
00:20:37,114 --> 00:20:40,606
There appears to be some chemical
residue on the lawn.

175
00:20:41,218 --> 00:20:42,947
Could match the traces on the glass.

176
00:20:43,154 --> 00:20:46,351
Not much,
but it's been that kind of day.

177
00:21:06,877 --> 00:21:09,641
You'd think they could afford
a weed-eater.

178
00:21:11,615 --> 00:21:15,107
Sorry, Mom, but the whole world's
going to seed.

179
00:21:20,324 --> 00:21:21,484
You!

180
00:21:31,902 --> 00:21:33,062
Bruce?

181
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:45,377
I'm having the banker cut through some
red tape. He can roll your money into...

182
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,141
...a higher-yield account.

183
00:21:47,351 --> 00:21:48,978
Amount? What amount?

184
00:21:49,486 --> 00:21:50,453
I said "account."

185
00:21:50,654 --> 00:21:53,885
I'm sorry, I was just... reminiscing.

186
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:57,493
That's okay.
You must have a lot on your mind.

187
00:21:57,695 --> 00:21:58,684
Monsieur?

188
00:22:08,372 --> 00:22:09,339
Remember this place?

189
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:13,408
Sure. You, me and Daddy used to come
here all the time.

190
00:22:13,711 --> 00:22:16,339
How is the old guy?
You're still close, aren't you?

191
00:22:16,547 --> 00:22:17,605
Closer than ever.

192
00:22:18,082 --> 00:22:21,017
I'm sorry he couldn't
make it into town, but...

193
00:22:21,385 --> 00:22:24,912
...l've always wished I could have
some time alone with you.

194
00:22:25,689 --> 00:22:28,624
Well, who knows what the future
might bring?

195
00:22:45,643 --> 00:22:49,636
<i>Welcome to the Gotham World's Fair,</i>
<i>a dream of the future-</i>

196
00:22:50,281 --> 00:22:54,741
<i>A bright tomorrow filled with hope</i>
<i>and promise for all mankind-</i>

197
00:22:55,085 --> 00:22:58,213
<i>This is a vision</i>
<i>of the shimmering utopia... - </i>

198
00:22:58,422 --> 00:23:02,051
<i>... - where we shall all spend</i>
<i>the rest of our lives-</i>

199
00:23:38,162 --> 00:23:41,461
Do you think we'll really see
any of this in our lifetime?

200
00:23:49,573 --> 00:23:51,336
Bruce, I'm talking to you.

201
00:23:52,476 --> 00:23:53,966
Oh! I'm sorry, Andi.

202
00:23:54,445 --> 00:23:56,709
- My mind was on something else.
- What?

203
00:23:57,047 --> 00:23:59,538
Oh, just, you know...
The future!

204
00:23:59,984 --> 00:24:03,351
Anyone's in particular,
or just the generic brand?

205
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:04,853
You know.

206
00:24:05,122 --> 00:24:08,956
No, I don't. Since when
do you talk to me about your plans?

207
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:10,091
By the way...

208
00:24:10,294 --> 00:24:13,195
...Dad's been wanting to meet you.
- Oh, yeah?

209
00:24:13,397 --> 00:24:15,331
I told him you're not up to it yet.

210
00:24:15,532 --> 00:24:16,362
I can meet him.

211
00:24:16,567 --> 00:24:17,829
Great!

212
00:24:18,402 --> 00:24:20,165
I'll call him right now.

213
00:24:23,374 --> 00:24:24,534
You sure about this?

214
00:24:24,842 --> 00:24:26,173
Sure, I'm sure.

215
00:24:26,977 --> 00:24:29,810
What am I doing?
This isn't part of the plan.

216
00:24:30,014 --> 00:24:31,641
I must be going nuts.

217
00:24:31,849 --> 00:24:36,183
If I may make so bold, Master Bruce,
I'd say quite the reverse.

218
00:24:37,454 --> 00:24:40,355
Mr. Beaumont,
here are the partnership papers.

219
00:24:40,891 --> 00:24:42,586
If you could just go over them...

220
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,591
IKnock, knock!

221
00:24:46,897 --> 00:24:49,422
This is a most pleasant interruption!

222
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,532
At last I meet the elusive Bruce Wayne.

223
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,828
Nice to meet you, sir.

224
00:24:54,038 --> 00:24:56,598
"Sir"? Don't be so formal, Bruce.

225
00:24:56,874 --> 00:25:00,105
She's said so much about you,
I feel we're practically family.

226
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,174
Daddy...

227
00:25:02,479 --> 00:25:04,106
Don't mind me. I was just leaving.

228
00:25:04,481 --> 00:25:05,505
I'm sorry.

229
00:25:05,916 --> 00:25:09,750
Arthur Reeves, one of the hot Young
Turks from my legal department.

230
00:25:09,953 --> 00:25:11,386
You should get to know him.

231
00:25:19,463 --> 00:25:21,021
I hope we're not interrupting.

232
00:25:21,231 --> 00:25:25,065
Not at all! I'm never too busy
for my Andi and her friends.

233
00:25:25,369 --> 00:25:28,304
I tell you, Bruce, I do
a lot of financial planning.

234
00:25:28,505 --> 00:25:31,440
In money matters, you can't
take the future for granted.

235
00:25:31,809 --> 00:25:35,677
But money means little without
loved ones to share it with.

236
00:25:35,913 --> 00:25:38,279
Nothing's more important than family.

237
00:25:38,715 --> 00:25:39,841
Yes, Mr. Beaumont.

238
00:25:40,217 --> 00:25:41,707
- Carl.
- Excuse me, sir...

239
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,944
...a Mr. Valestra is here to see you.

240
00:25:44,154 --> 00:25:46,679
He says he has an appointment...

241
00:25:47,758 --> 00:25:50,283
If he says he has an appointment...

242
00:25:50,494 --> 00:25:52,428
...then he has an appointment.

243
00:25:52,763 --> 00:25:55,698
That's what I like about your pop,
kiddo.

244
00:25:55,999 --> 00:25:58,490
He knows his priorities.

245
00:26:07,444 --> 00:26:10,538
Is my shirt too big,
or is that my flesh crawling?

246
00:26:10,747 --> 00:26:14,046
Mr. Valestra is not what you'd call
a "people person."

247
00:26:14,251 --> 00:26:15,275
No kidding!

248
00:26:15,486 --> 00:26:18,683
That's just Daddy's business.
He deals with everyone.

249
00:26:18,889 --> 00:26:20,948
It's not your father, Andi, it's...

250
00:26:21,158 --> 00:26:22,819
...it's everything!

251
00:26:25,929 --> 00:26:28,090
I said hand over the cashbox, man!

252
00:26:35,739 --> 00:26:36,865
Give me!

253
00:26:37,107 --> 00:26:40,474
- Pops here needs some persuasion.
- Don't hurt me!

254
00:26:40,744 --> 00:26:43,770
- Stay here! I gotta stop this.
- Bruce, don't.

255
00:26:44,548 --> 00:26:46,482
What should I do? Just stand here?

256
00:26:46,817 --> 00:26:49,718
Just come back to me in one piece,
please?

257
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:08,661
Better have your
insurance paid up, sucker!

258
00:28:01,458 --> 00:28:03,323
Come on! Pick up the box!

259
00:28:03,527 --> 00:28:04,619
Pick up the box!

260
00:28:11,068 --> 00:28:13,764
Thank God you're all right.
I was so frightened!

261
00:28:14,037 --> 00:28:15,698
Let me have a look at you.

262
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:17,597
Andrea, please!

263
00:28:31,655 --> 00:28:34,249
What am I still doing this for?

264
00:28:42,366 --> 00:28:45,665
It's gotta be one or the other.
I can't have it both ways.

265
00:28:45,869 --> 00:28:49,396
I can't put myself on the line
if someone's waiting for me at home.

266
00:28:49,606 --> 00:28:52,803
Miss Beaumont would be glad to know
you feel that way.

267
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:55,478
She's holding on line one, sir.

268
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:00,981
Master Bruce?

269
00:29:01,418 --> 00:29:03,682
Alfred, I can't. Not now.

270
00:29:05,188 --> 00:29:06,450
What shall I say, sir?

271
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,417
I don't know.

272
00:29:08,892 --> 00:29:10,450
I just don't know!

273
00:29:17,701 --> 00:29:19,464
It doesn't mean I don't care anymore.

274
00:29:20,304 --> 00:29:22,795
I don't want to let you down, honest.

275
00:29:24,041 --> 00:29:26,976
But it just doesn't hurt
so bad anymore.

276
00:29:27,711 --> 00:29:29,508
You can understand, can't you?

277
00:29:29,713 --> 00:29:32,614
I can give money to the city
to hire more cops.

278
00:29:32,816 --> 00:29:35,307
Let others take the risk.
It's different now!

279
00:29:41,858 --> 00:29:45,555
Please. I need it to be different now.

280
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,394
I know I made a promise.
But I didn't see this coming!

281
00:29:53,403 --> 00:29:55,064
I didn't count on being happy.

282
00:30:00,644 --> 00:30:01,838
Please...

283
00:30:02,412 --> 00:30:04,403
...tell me that it's okay.

284
00:30:05,082 --> 00:30:07,016
Maybe they already have.

285
00:30:11,588 --> 00:30:12,816
Maybe they sent me.

286
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,420
Get in.

287
00:30:53,997 --> 00:30:56,591
All I want to know is, is it true?

288
00:30:56,933 --> 00:30:59,697
Is the Batman really hitting our people?

289
00:30:59,936 --> 00:31:01,597
We have eyewitnesses.

290
00:31:01,872 --> 00:31:02,839
Beautiful.

291
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,906
That's just beautiful. Why?

292
00:31:06,109 --> 00:31:09,977
He never leaned on us before.
I'm too old for this.

293
00:31:10,213 --> 00:31:12,579
You could demand police protection.

294
00:31:12,783 --> 00:31:17,083
What are you, a comedian?
This is the Batman we're talking about.

295
00:31:17,287 --> 00:31:18,584
A freak job!

296
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:20,882
He'll crucify me!

297
00:31:31,701 --> 00:31:32,599
Pull over.

298
00:31:34,738 --> 00:31:36,763
It's not very healthy in here.

299
00:31:43,914 --> 00:31:45,939
"O'Neil Funding Corporation."

300
00:31:46,149 --> 00:31:47,673
"Adam's Tool and Die."

301
00:31:47,918 --> 00:31:49,852
I should've known.

302
00:31:50,153 --> 00:31:51,085
Sir?

303
00:31:51,288 --> 00:31:53,085
Chuckie Sol and Buzz Bronski.

304
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:56,191
They have a history as partners
in dummy corporations...

305
00:31:56,393 --> 00:31:58,452
...set up over 10 years ago.

306
00:31:58,829 --> 00:32:02,959
The third director
was one Salvatore Valestra.

307
00:32:05,469 --> 00:32:07,437
Sal's having company tonight.

308
00:32:07,637 --> 00:32:09,229
Don't wait up.

309
00:32:09,773 --> 00:32:14,039
Meaning, I trust that once you're done
with him, you'll be seeing her?

310
00:32:14,244 --> 00:32:17,042
You think you know everything about me,
don't you?

311
00:32:17,247 --> 00:32:21,513
I diapered your bottom.
I bloody well ought to... sir!

312
00:32:23,587 --> 00:32:24,815
Well, you're wrong!

313
00:33:00,857 --> 00:33:02,848
Andrea's father...?

314
00:33:04,194 --> 00:33:06,924
You know how I've always
wanted to see Europe.

315
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:12,033
Dad has business there. It's a hush-
hush deal. He won't tell me a thing.

316
00:33:12,369 --> 00:33:14,337
Not even when we'd be coming back.

317
00:33:14,538 --> 00:33:18,099
Will you at least let me try
to talk you out of it?

318
00:33:18,308 --> 00:33:19,434
Wait, please.

319
00:33:22,546 --> 00:33:24,070
Never mind.

320
00:33:24,981 --> 00:33:26,573
I'm no good at this.

321
00:33:29,152 --> 00:33:31,746
Here. You'll get the idea.

322
00:33:37,727 --> 00:33:38,853
What do you say?

323
00:33:41,164 --> 00:33:44,691
Of course I will!
I never thought this would happen.

324
00:33:44,901 --> 00:33:48,200
I always felt like I'd
thrown you a curve ball.

325
00:33:48,405 --> 00:33:51,704
Like you never knew what to do with me,
since I wasn't in the plan.

326
00:33:51,908 --> 00:33:55,036
You are now. I'm changing the plan.

327
00:34:17,734 --> 00:34:19,395
Looks like Dad's got company.

328
00:34:19,703 --> 00:34:21,227
Business-type company.

329
00:34:21,438 --> 00:34:24,464
He doesn't usually see clients here.
Not at this hour.

330
00:34:29,245 --> 00:34:32,214
Maybe we should wait
to tell him the good news.

331
00:34:32,415 --> 00:34:34,508
- Maybe.
- Good night, Bruce.

332
00:34:35,018 --> 00:34:36,952
- Alfred.
- Miss.

333
00:34:54,137 --> 00:34:55,934
It's another cave, all right.

334
00:34:58,441 --> 00:35:02,275
As big as the house, judging from
all the bats that came out of it.

335
00:35:02,579 --> 00:35:04,046
Alfred, what's wrong?

336
00:35:04,247 --> 00:35:06,238
This just arrived, sir.

337
00:35:15,325 --> 00:35:17,225
"Left with Dad.

338
00:35:17,427 --> 00:35:18,894
Too young...

339
00:35:19,095 --> 00:35:20,562
...need time.

340
00:35:20,764 --> 00:35:22,231
Forget about me."

341
00:36:10,547 --> 00:36:12,037
My God!

342
00:36:47,751 --> 00:36:50,413
If there was just some other way...

343
00:37:17,614 --> 00:37:19,946
I hate that song.

344
00:37:20,784 --> 00:37:21,751
Gasp!

345
00:37:21,951 --> 00:37:23,350
Can it be?

346
00:37:23,553 --> 00:37:26,954
Old Sallie "The Wheezer" Valestra.

347
00:37:28,224 --> 00:37:30,283
Welcome, paisan!

348
00:37:30,894 --> 00:37:33,192
It's been a dog's age.

349
00:37:33,396 --> 00:37:36,854
Hello, Joker.
Didn't mean to drop by unannounced.

350
00:37:37,066 --> 00:37:38,863
Oh, Salvatore!

351
00:37:39,068 --> 00:37:40,865
Why so formal?

352
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:44,631
<i>Mi casa nostra es su casa nostra-</i>

353
00:37:46,409 --> 00:37:50,607
What does an old-timer like you
want with a two-timer like me?

354
00:37:50,814 --> 00:37:52,247
Business.

355
00:37:52,482 --> 00:37:53,779
Oh, business!

356
00:37:53,983 --> 00:37:55,951
Sounds like fun! Come!

357
00:37:56,152 --> 00:37:59,178
We'll repair to more
comfortable environs.

358
00:37:59,389 --> 00:38:02,847
Now hold on to your hat,
and watch those valuables.

359
00:38:03,059 --> 00:38:05,687
It's going to be a bumpy ride!

360
00:38:22,712 --> 00:38:24,680
Honey, I'm home!

361
00:38:30,053 --> 00:38:32,487
Don't mind my home-security system.

362
00:38:32,689 --> 00:38:34,452
Down, Rusty.

363
00:38:36,226 --> 00:38:39,923
Can't be too careful,
with all those weirdos around.

364
00:38:43,867 --> 00:38:46,495
What? Meat loaf again?

365
00:38:46,703 --> 00:38:48,933
Oh, I had it for lunch!

366
00:38:49,138 --> 00:38:51,572
Isn't Hazel here a cutie?

367
00:38:51,808 --> 00:38:56,177
True, she's a real homebody, but you
can't help who you fall in love with.

368
00:38:58,681 --> 00:39:01,172
Come. Have a seat, Sal.

369
00:39:02,418 --> 00:39:05,080
Tell me what's on your so-called mind.

370
00:39:06,222 --> 00:39:07,655
It's Batman.

371
00:39:07,857 --> 00:39:09,222
He's gone nuts!

372
00:39:09,425 --> 00:39:11,290
First he whacked Chuckie Sol...

373
00:39:11,527 --> 00:39:12,619
...then Buzz.

374
00:39:12,929 --> 00:39:14,328
Now he's after me.

375
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:19,433
I've been reading lately how old
guano-man is wound tight enough to snap.

376
00:39:19,869 --> 00:39:24,363
Wouldn't it be great if I'd finally
driven him off the deep end?

377
00:39:24,807 --> 00:39:26,172
This isn't a joke!

378
00:39:26,376 --> 00:39:29,311
He's knocking us off, and
only you can take him down.

379
00:39:29,545 --> 00:39:33,413
Five million up front, with
whatever you want to finish him off.

380
00:39:36,386 --> 00:39:39,048
What do I look like? Pest control?

381
00:39:39,656 --> 00:39:43,387
Think, you fool! Once he gets me,
how long till he gets you?

382
00:39:43,626 --> 00:39:45,526
You know what I'm talking about.

383
00:39:45,728 --> 00:39:47,889
Your hands are just as dirty.

384
00:39:48,564 --> 00:39:49,758
Dirtier!

385
00:39:51,734 --> 00:39:55,727
Don't touch me, old man!
I don't know where you've been!

386
00:39:56,139 --> 00:39:59,700
Oh, Sal, no one could
take a joke like you.

387
00:39:59,909 --> 00:40:02,434
- Of course I'll help you out.
- Really?

388
00:40:02,745 --> 00:40:04,042
<i>Certainement-</i>

389
00:40:04,247 --> 00:40:07,910
No way is anybody
gonna hurt my pal Sal.

390
00:40:08,918 --> 00:40:09,942
That's it!

391
00:40:10,153 --> 00:40:12,178
That's what I want to see.

392
00:40:12,522 --> 00:40:15,457
A nice, big smile.

393
00:40:17,327 --> 00:40:20,262
- Thanks for another lovely dinner.
- My pleasure.

394
00:40:21,998 --> 00:40:25,161
You know, it's not good to go to bed
on a full stomach.

395
00:40:25,435 --> 00:40:26,800
We could stay up...

396
00:40:27,036 --> 00:40:28,230
...talk for a while.

397
00:40:28,438 --> 00:40:30,929
I've got a killer day tomorrow, Artie.

398
00:40:31,374 --> 00:40:32,807
But call me, okay?

399
00:40:36,279 --> 00:40:37,246
Good night.

400
00:40:45,688 --> 00:40:48,282
So we meet again. I like the cape.

401
00:40:48,524 --> 00:40:51,015
I'm not sure about the mask though.

402
00:40:52,462 --> 00:40:53,861
Have you ever seen this?

403
00:40:56,866 --> 00:40:58,629
But that's your father.

404
00:40:58,968 --> 00:41:01,266
He set up their corporate partnership.

405
00:41:01,471 --> 00:41:03,098
So? That's his job.

406
00:41:03,539 --> 00:41:06,667
He's the one element
that tied these gangsters together.

407
00:41:06,876 --> 00:41:09,174
- Where's your father now?
- Haven't a clue.

408
00:41:09,379 --> 00:41:11,006
Why don't you try Madagascar?

409
00:41:11,214 --> 00:41:12,806
That's not what you told Reeves.

410
00:41:13,016 --> 00:41:15,416
You said you were closer than ever
to your father.

411
00:41:15,618 --> 00:41:17,142
You had me bugged?

412
00:41:17,353 --> 00:41:18,377
I can read lips.

413
00:41:18,621 --> 00:41:21,317
Then read them now. Get out.

414
00:41:26,029 --> 00:41:27,929
Still following your Dad's orders?

415
00:41:28,197 --> 00:41:33,100
The way I see it, the only one in this
room controlled by his parents is you.

416
00:42:23,152 --> 00:42:25,143
Sal Valestra...

417
00:42:25,354 --> 00:42:27,845
...your Angel of Death awaits.

418
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:37,629
<i>Guess the joke is on me!</i>
<i>You're not Batman after a</i>//-

419
00:42:37,834 --> 00:42:40,132
<i>Looks like there's a new face</i>
<i>in Gotham... - </i>

420
00:42:40,336 --> 00:42:43,863
<i>... - and soon his name</i>
<i>will be all over town-</i>

421
00:42:44,073 --> 00:42:48,032
<i>To say nothing of his legs,</i>
<i>feet, spleen... - </i>

422
00:42:48,244 --> 00:42:49,370
<i>... - and head!</i>

423
00:43:40,062 --> 00:43:42,690
Stay away! This is not your fight!

424
00:43:44,834 --> 00:43:46,699
This madness ends now!

425
00:43:58,848 --> 00:44:01,942
<i>Batman, this is the police-</i>
<i>You are under arrest-</i>

426
00:44:02,151 --> 00:44:04,051
<i>Step away from the edge of the roof-</i>

427
00:44:04,253 --> 00:44:08,212
<i>Put your hands on top of your head</i>
<i>and stay in the light-</i>

428
00:44:08,925 --> 00:44:10,358
Stay on him!

429
00:44:12,562 --> 00:44:15,998
<i>This is 6-30 in pursuit-</i>
<i>Subject moving north along Denny Drive-</i>

430
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:20,192
<i>All units approach with caution-</i>
<i>Subject is armed and dangerous-</i>

431
00:44:20,403 --> 00:44:22,530
<i>Use of deadly force is authorized-</i>

432
00:44:35,718 --> 00:44:38,152
Take it down! I gotta get closer!

433
00:44:45,261 --> 00:44:46,250
Freeze!

434
00:44:56,038 --> 00:44:58,268
He's heading for the
construction site!

435
00:44:58,741 --> 00:45:02,802
<i>SWAT deployment teams, move</i>
<i>into position- All units acknowledge-</i>

436
00:45:03,012 --> 00:45:05,503
<i>Roger that- Moving into position-</i>

437
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,796
<i>All available units to 4th and Madison,</i>
<i>the construction site-</i>

438
00:45:20,997 --> 00:45:23,864
<i>Charlie-three, prepare for tear gas-</i>

439
00:45:30,773 --> 00:45:32,138
There he is, men!

440
00:45:36,912 --> 00:45:38,311
Hey, wait!

441
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:45,882
You jerk!

442
00:45:47,256 --> 00:45:48,723
Get a light up there!

443
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:10,006
<i>Delta-three to ground-</i>
<i>He's down- We have him!</i>

444
00:46:18,788 --> 00:46:19,982
Fire!

445
00:46:29,799 --> 00:46:31,198
<i>Quick, around the back!

446
00:46:36,305 --> 00:46:38,102
Come on, you grunts!

447
00:46:59,995 --> 00:47:01,155
Hurry!

448
00:47:04,367 --> 00:47:05,527
Who's that?

449
00:47:15,878 --> 00:47:19,370
There are certain advantages
to having a sturdy cranium.

450
00:47:19,882 --> 00:47:23,374
But then, hardheadedness
was always your virtue.

451
00:47:23,753 --> 00:47:26,916
Well, I'm sure I have things
to do elsewhere.

452
00:47:27,423 --> 00:47:31,359
You have an excellent sense of timing.

453
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,222
It was all over TV.
I had to do something.

454
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:35,861
I'm grateful, of course.

455
00:47:36,065 --> 00:47:40,229
But I need to know why you won't
tell me the truth about your father.

456
00:47:42,171 --> 00:47:46,198
I suppose the "world's greatest
detective" will find out eventually.

457
00:47:46,409 --> 00:47:50,573
You remember Daddy was having a meeting
that night with his partners...

458
00:48:00,256 --> 00:48:02,121
You're a liar and a cheat, Carl.

459
00:48:02,958 --> 00:48:04,687
You've taken what's ours.

460
00:48:04,894 --> 00:48:07,556
- You're gonna pay one way or another.
- No! Please!

461
00:48:07,797 --> 00:48:08,889
Daddy! What's going on?

462
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:14,394
I'm sorry you had to see this,
Miss Beaumont.

463
00:48:16,939 --> 00:48:18,167
Let her go!

464
00:48:18,374 --> 00:48:19,432
Watch it, Carl!

465
00:48:20,876 --> 00:48:24,312
Please, Sal, give me one more day.
I swear I'll get the money.

466
00:48:24,513 --> 00:48:26,242
Convince me.

467
00:48:26,449 --> 00:48:28,542
This time tomorrow.
On my mother's grave.

468
00:48:28,751 --> 00:48:32,949
As soon as the European banks open,
I'll have it wired to you.

469
00:48:44,934 --> 00:48:46,925
Twenty-four hours.

470
00:48:47,303 --> 00:48:50,204
This time tomorrow
we'll have the money...

471
00:48:50,406 --> 00:48:53,603
...or I'll have your heart
in my hand.

472
00:48:53,809 --> 00:48:54,707
Let's go, boys.

473
00:49:07,289 --> 00:49:08,483
Are you all right?

474
00:49:08,691 --> 00:49:11,956
Pack a suitcase.
We've got to get to the airport, now!

475
00:49:12,194 --> 00:49:13,889
But you said you'd have the money.

476
00:49:14,129 --> 00:49:17,030
It's not that simple.
It's tied up in investments.

477
00:49:17,233 --> 00:49:20,031
- It could take weeks.
- But I can't leave!

478
00:49:20,402 --> 00:49:22,666
Bruce proposed.
We're getting married.

479
00:49:22,872 --> 00:49:24,169
Listen to me.

480
00:49:24,373 --> 00:49:27,865
I just used up the last shred
of pity Sal Valestra has.

481
00:49:28,143 --> 00:49:32,136
If I don't pay him within 24 hours,
they'll kill us both!

482
00:49:33,549 --> 00:49:37,451
Why did you do this? Why did you
get involved with these people?

483
00:49:37,653 --> 00:49:39,086
I'm sorry, Andi.

484
00:49:39,488 --> 00:49:41,683
I just wanted a chance for you.

485
00:49:41,891 --> 00:49:44,917
I'll get you out of this.
We'll be free of those guys.

486
00:49:45,261 --> 00:49:47,126
Whatever it takes.

487
00:49:47,329 --> 00:49:49,058
That's a promise.

488
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,798
<i>From that night, we were on the run-</i>

489
00:49:54,003 --> 00:49:58,030
<i>We hid all over Europe, eventually</i>
<i>settled on the Mediterranean coast-</i>

490
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,903
<i>Dad was able to parlay the money</i>
<i>he embezzled into a fortune-</i>

491
00:50:03,245 --> 00:50:06,237
Finally, he thought he had enough
to pay them back.

492
00:50:06,582 --> 00:50:08,049
It would never be enough.

493
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:12,346
They wanted interest compounded
in blood. He had to find another way.

494
00:50:12,688 --> 00:50:15,248
The man in the costume...
Your father?

495
00:50:15,524 --> 00:50:17,651
He said he'd get them. Somehow.

496
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:19,760
When I heard about Chuckie Sol...

497
00:50:20,029 --> 00:50:21,462
...I had to come back...

498
00:50:21,664 --> 00:50:23,825
...to find him, to stop him.

499
00:50:24,033 --> 00:50:25,864
I'm sorry, Bruce.

500
00:50:26,268 --> 00:50:30,534
That's twice now I've come
into your life and screwed it up.

501
00:51:09,745 --> 00:51:11,975
Can we make it work this time?

502
00:51:12,247 --> 00:51:14,215
I want to say yes...

503
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:17,715
...but you know it'll come down
between me and your father.

504
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,081
Daddy doesn't matter anymore.

505
00:51:32,668 --> 00:51:33,760
I'll see you tonight.

506
00:51:34,269 --> 00:51:35,429
I'll be here.

507
00:51:40,943 --> 00:51:44,106
It's so good to see you
and Miss Beaumont together again.

508
00:51:44,313 --> 00:51:47,840
Might one ask what this bodes
for your alter ego?

509
00:51:50,619 --> 00:51:52,587
I'm not sure, Alfred.

510
00:51:53,689 --> 00:51:56,283
Everything's happening so fast.

511
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:59,327
So much has changed.

512
00:51:59,528 --> 00:52:01,257
You still love each other.

513
00:52:01,463 --> 00:52:02,930
That's true.

514
00:52:03,132 --> 00:52:04,793
I love her.

515
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,361
Maybe after this is settled...

516
00:52:07,903 --> 00:52:09,598
Maybe then...

517
00:52:09,805 --> 00:52:12,365
I'm sure they'd have
wanted you to be happy.

518
00:52:22,217 --> 00:52:23,980
Is something wrong?

519
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,051
Maybe.

520
00:52:41,737 --> 00:52:46,606
You're saying there were 4 precincts on
Batman's heels, and he still got away?

521
00:52:49,678 --> 00:52:51,009
Unbelievable!

522
00:52:52,581 --> 00:52:54,071
Tsk, tsk.

523
00:52:54,349 --> 00:52:57,750
And to think our tax money
goes to pay those jerks.

524
00:53:00,789 --> 00:53:01,915
You!

525
00:53:04,026 --> 00:53:08,963
That's right, Artie. Bring in the
press, why don't you? What a photo-op.

526
00:53:09,198 --> 00:53:12,133
The Councilman and his wacky pal!

527
00:53:12,534 --> 00:53:13,899
You're no friend of mine.

528
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:17,736
Oh, Artie, I'm crushed!

529
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:20,340
How the high and mighty forget!

530
00:53:20,542 --> 00:53:21,804
Don't you remember?

531
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:23,034
You, me...

532
00:53:23,245 --> 00:53:25,213
...Sallie and the gang?

533
00:53:25,714 --> 00:53:29,241
What are you talking about?
I never met them or you.

534
00:53:29,451 --> 00:53:32,420
I worked for Beaumont.
I didn't know what he was doing.

535
00:53:32,721 --> 00:53:35,087
But you knew about it afterwards.

536
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:37,952
And put it to good use, eh?

537
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:39,620
What do you want?

538
00:53:40,395 --> 00:53:43,262
To find out who has iced the old gang.

539
00:53:44,133 --> 00:53:46,931
Haven't you read the papers?
It's Batman!

540
00:53:49,138 --> 00:53:51,265
Wrong! It ain't the Bat.

541
00:53:51,473 --> 00:53:53,270
Nope, I've seen the guy.

542
00:53:53,475 --> 00:53:56,603
He looks more like
the Ghost of Christmas Future.

543
00:53:56,812 --> 00:53:59,212
Nowhere near as cute as Batboy.

544
00:53:59,414 --> 00:54:01,006
You say it's someone else?

545
00:54:02,317 --> 00:54:06,811
Someone who wouldn't mind seeing
our old pals out of the way.

546
00:54:08,423 --> 00:54:09,390
Maybe...

547
00:54:09,591 --> 00:54:11,354
...gulp... sob...

548
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,057
...me too!

549
00:54:13,262 --> 00:54:15,787
That's when I thought
about you, Arturo.

550
00:54:15,998 --> 00:54:20,059
An important, upstanding guy like you
could find it awkward...

551
00:54:20,269 --> 00:54:23,500
...if certain secrets were
revealed about his past.

552
00:54:24,206 --> 00:54:27,300
Wait. You're not saying that l...

553
00:54:27,576 --> 00:54:29,567
<i>Mr- Reeves, Miss Beaumont</i>
<i>on the line-</i>

554
00:54:29,778 --> 00:54:32,508
Beaumont? Not the babe!

555
00:54:33,515 --> 00:54:35,506
Oh, you devil!

556
00:54:39,855 --> 00:54:41,516
Arthur, are you there?

557
00:54:42,791 --> 00:54:46,386
Hello, Andrea.
We're still on for lunch, right?

558
00:54:46,762 --> 00:54:51,699
I'm sorry, I can't. I got hung up.
I'll explain everything tonight.

559
00:54:52,634 --> 00:54:53,965
All right.

560
00:54:54,203 --> 00:54:55,795
I'll see you then.

561
00:54:56,972 --> 00:54:59,497
Now, ain't that a co-inky-dink?

562
00:54:59,708 --> 00:55:01,801
We're talking about the old man...

563
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:05,036
...and the spawn of his loins
just happens to call.

564
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,846
Makes you want to laugh, doesn't it?

565
00:55:32,708 --> 00:55:33,606
Good heavens!

566
00:55:35,077 --> 00:55:38,240
Councilman, please.
You've got to control yourself.

567
00:55:38,847 --> 00:55:40,474
I'm trying, for God's sake!

568
00:55:40,682 --> 00:55:42,513
Here's the relaxant, doctor.

569
00:55:44,586 --> 00:55:45,746
I need some help.

570
00:55:45,954 --> 00:55:46,978
IKeep him still!

571
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:49,921
Councilman, please!

572
00:55:51,393 --> 00:55:52,724
That's it.

573
00:55:52,928 --> 00:55:54,691
That's right...

574
00:55:57,199 --> 00:56:00,430
That should relax you enough
for the toxin to run its course.

575
00:56:00,636 --> 00:56:02,103
Try to stay calm.

576
00:56:27,496 --> 00:56:29,225
Oh, no!

577
00:56:30,299 --> 00:56:32,233
Why did the Joker meet with you?

578
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:37,461
Is it about
the gangster murders?

579
00:56:38,006 --> 00:56:40,406
He thinks you're involved. Why?!

580
00:56:43,812 --> 00:56:45,302
I don't know.

581
00:56:46,949 --> 00:56:49,110
That's not the answer I want.

582
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:55,954
Beaumont needed me to help him
and his kid get out of town.

583
00:56:56,158 --> 00:56:57,455
He kept in touch.

584
00:56:57,826 --> 00:56:59,521
When did you last speak?

585
00:56:59,795 --> 00:57:01,126
Years ago.

586
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:03,389
My first election campaign.

587
00:57:03,598 --> 00:57:07,125
I was running out of money
and asked Beaumont for help.

588
00:57:07,936 --> 00:57:09,597
He said no!

589
00:57:10,706 --> 00:57:12,697
So you sold him to the Mob.

590
00:57:16,178 --> 00:57:18,305
I was broke, desperate!

591
00:57:18,513 --> 00:57:21,448
They said all they wanted
was their money back.

592
00:57:29,124 --> 00:57:30,022
Councilman.

593
00:57:30,225 --> 00:57:31,817
Councilman, please!

594
00:58:15,003 --> 00:58:17,665
<i>Hello, anybody home?</i>

595
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:22,640
Listen, boopsie, even though
you never call and never write...

596
00:58:22,844 --> 00:58:24,971
...I still got a soft spot for you.

597
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:28,377
So I'm sending you a fun gift.
Airmail.

598
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:32,846
<i>And there's no use jumping</i>
<i>out the window this time, toots-</i>

599
00:58:33,388 --> 00:58:37,825
<i>The plane of the future</i>
<i>is going to make you history-</i>

600
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:50,638
<i>Hello? Hello, operator?</i>

601
00:58:50,839 --> 00:58:52,500
<i>I believe my party's been... - </i>

602
00:58:52,707 --> 00:58:54,572
<i>... - disconnected!</i>

603
00:59:20,102 --> 00:59:21,126
You!

604
00:59:21,336 --> 00:59:23,600
But he paid you!

605
00:59:25,107 --> 00:59:26,506
Dad?!

606
00:59:40,889 --> 00:59:44,290
Well, Haze, guess it's
time to call it a night.

607
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:50,425
What do you say, hon?

608
00:59:50,632 --> 00:59:53,294
Feeling the old electricity tonight?

609
01:00:00,475 --> 01:00:05,276
Ain't it always the way? You get
in the mood and company shows up.

610
01:00:06,815 --> 01:00:08,009
Joker...

611
01:00:08,216 --> 01:00:10,878
...your Angel of Death awaits.

612
01:00:11,219 --> 01:00:13,016
I'm impressed, lady.

613
01:00:13,221 --> 01:00:16,952
You're harder to kill
than a cockroach on steroids.

614
01:00:17,292 --> 01:00:19,226
So, you figured it out?

615
01:00:21,563 --> 01:00:23,827
Gotta hand it to you. Nice scheme!

616
01:00:24,032 --> 01:00:27,866
Costume's a bit theatrical,
but hey, who am I to talk?

617
01:00:37,846 --> 01:00:39,438
Very cute...

618
01:00:39,648 --> 01:00:42,515
...but I can blow smoke too, toots!

619
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:54,057
Nice trick, sweetheart.

620
01:00:54,262 --> 01:00:57,663
You could teach old Batsy
a thing or two about disappearing.

621
01:01:00,869 --> 01:01:02,700
You're not smiling, Joker.

622
01:01:03,104 --> 01:01:04,901
I thought you found death amusing.

623
01:01:05,106 --> 01:01:06,767
Me? Oh, no.

624
01:01:06,975 --> 01:01:09,102
You won't hear a giggle out of me.

625
01:01:15,317 --> 01:01:16,215
Made you look!

626
01:01:50,452 --> 01:01:52,477
Well, if it isn't Smokey the Babe!

627
01:01:52,687 --> 01:01:55,588
Just in time to meet her biggest fan!

628
01:02:01,129 --> 01:02:03,927
How about a little pick-me-up?

629
01:03:17,339 --> 01:03:19,000
Your father's dead, isn't he?

630
01:03:19,207 --> 01:03:21,835
You came into town early
to get Chuckie Sol...

631
01:03:22,177 --> 01:03:25,146
...so you could shift the blame
to your father.

632
01:03:25,347 --> 01:03:27,144
They took everything, Bruce.

633
01:03:27,349 --> 01:03:28,873
My dad, my life...

634
01:03:29,084 --> 01:03:30,073
...you.

635
01:03:30,585 --> 01:03:34,214
I'm not saying it's right, or even
sane, but it's all I've got left.

636
01:03:34,422 --> 01:03:36,652
So either help me
or get out of the way!

637
01:03:36,891 --> 01:03:38,324
You know I can't do that.

638
01:03:38,526 --> 01:03:40,255
Look at what they did to us...

639
01:03:40,462 --> 01:03:42,020
...what we could have had!

640
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:43,754
They had to pay.

641
01:03:43,965 --> 01:03:47,230
But Andi, what will vengeance solve?

642
01:03:47,435 --> 01:03:50,097
If anyone knows the answer
to that, Bruce...

643
01:03:50,338 --> 01:03:51,703
...it's you.

644
01:03:53,241 --> 01:03:54,469
Leave, Andi.

645
01:03:54,676 --> 01:03:55,938
Now.

646
01:03:56,578 --> 01:03:57,738
Please.

647
01:04:11,059 --> 01:04:12,617
Oh, Batsy!

648
01:04:15,463 --> 01:04:16,794
Yoo-hoo!

649
01:06:11,112 --> 01:06:13,342
You're too late, Batman!

650
01:06:13,548 --> 01:06:16,312
There are 20 miles of tunnels
under this place.

651
01:06:16,551 --> 01:06:18,883
And they're all filled
with explosives.

652
01:06:19,187 --> 01:06:22,748
In five minutes, everything goes up!

653
01:07:23,985 --> 01:07:27,284
You just don't know
when to quit, do you?

654
01:07:32,794 --> 01:07:34,489
What are you doing?

655
01:07:36,464 --> 01:07:39,661
You're crazy! I'm your only chance
to get out of here!

656
01:07:39,901 --> 01:07:42,199
Let me go or we'll both die!

657
01:07:42,537 --> 01:07:43,834
Whatever it takes!

658
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:06,988
For once...

659
01:08:07,195 --> 01:08:09,993
...l'm stuck without a punch line.

660
01:08:14,235 --> 01:08:15,395
Okay...

661
01:08:15,603 --> 01:08:16,763
...I give up.

662
01:08:17,038 --> 01:08:18,665
I surrendered already.

663
01:08:18,873 --> 01:08:20,340
Tell her, Batman.

664
01:08:21,709 --> 01:08:24,269
You've got to get out of here.

665
01:08:24,545 --> 01:08:27,810
The place is wired to explode!

666
01:08:28,116 --> 01:08:31,176
No. One way or another,
it ends tonight.

667
01:08:31,819 --> 01:08:33,184
Goodbye, my love.

668
01:10:07,315 --> 01:10:09,340
I couldn't save her, Alfred.

669
01:10:09,550 --> 01:10:11,780
I don't think she wanted to be saved.

670
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:15,018
Vengeance blackens the soul, Bruce.

671
01:10:15,423 --> 01:10:19,086
I always feared you would become
that which you fought against.

672
01:10:19,293 --> 01:10:23,195
You walk the edge of that abyss
every night, but you haven't fallen in.

673
01:10:23,397 --> 01:10:25,661
And I thank heaven for that.

674
01:10:28,669 --> 01:10:31,934
But Andrea fell into
that pit years ago.

675
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:35,007
No one, not even you,
could have pulled her back.

676
01:10:45,753 --> 01:10:46,913
What is it?

677
01:11:31,065 --> 01:11:32,464
<i>Quite a sight.

678
01:11:34,035 --> 01:11:35,627
I'm sorry...

679
01:11:36,070 --> 01:11:37,935
...do you want to be alone?

680
01:11:38,272 --> 01:11:39,739
I am.

682
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:22,040
