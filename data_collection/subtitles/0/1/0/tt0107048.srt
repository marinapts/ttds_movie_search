1
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,113
<i>Somebody asked me,</i>

2
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,477
<i>"Phil, if you could be anywhere,</i>
<i>where would you be?"</i>

3
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,154
I said to him,
<i>"</i> Probably right here...

4
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,358
...EIko, Nevada.<i>"</i>
Our nation<i>'</i>s high at 79 today.

5
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,154
In California, they<i>'</i>ll have
warm weather tomorrow...

6
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,914
...gang wars and some
overpriced real estate.

7
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,879
In the Pacific Northwest,
they<i>'</i>ll have some...

8
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,718
...very, very tall trees.

9
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,394
Clear across the Rockies
and Great Plains.

10
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,949
But look out, here comes trouble.

11
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,029
Oh, boy!

12
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,318
Front coming our way!
Look out!

13
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,196
What will that mean to us?
One of these big blue things!

14
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,149
This cold, frigid arctic air,
this big mass out of the north.

15
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,191
It<i>'</i>ll meet up with all this
moisture out of the Gulf.

16
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,715
They<i>'</i>ll mix at high altitudes
and cause snow.

17
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,190
It won<i>'</i>t hit us here in Pittsburgh.
It<i>'</i>ll push off and hit Altoona.

18
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,435
Close call!

19
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,272
Let<i>'</i>s look at the five-day.

20
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,753
As you can see, nothing to be
too scared about.

21
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,550
Bundle up warm, but you can
leave your galoshes at home.

22
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,399
I won<i>'</i>t be here at 10:00.
Tomorrow<i>'</i>s Groundhog Day.

23
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,952
I<i>'</i>ll be in Punxsutawney for our
country<i>'</i>s oldest Groundhog Festival.

24
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,272
According to the legend,
tomorrow, February 2nd...

25
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,154
...if the groundhog wakes
and sees his shadow...

26
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,396
...we<i>'</i>ve got six more weeks
of winter.

27
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,669
Sounds like fun.

28
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,310
You must really enjoy it.
This is your third year in a row.

29
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,754
Four, Nan.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,910
Four.

31
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,275
Thanks, Phil.

32
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,998
Next, our entertainment editor
looks at sex and violence in movies.

33
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,275
Stay with us.

34
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,229
We<i>'</i>re clear.

35
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,277
Have fun in Punxsutawney.

36
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,030
For your information, Hairdo,
a major network is interested in me.

37
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,794
That would be the
Home Shopping Network.

38
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,680
Thanks, Larry.
Go wait in the van.

39
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,629
That was nice, Phil.
<i>"</i> Big trees<i>"</i>!

40
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,710
Stop, Kenny.

41
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,480
Look, can you handle
the 10:00 or not?

42
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,679
If you don<i>'</i>t want to rush back,
I can do the 5:00 tomorrow.

43
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,753
Stay an extra second in Punxsutawney?
Please!

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,116
Rita thinks it<i>'</i>d be
a great idea...

45
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,591
...to stay for other events.
You<i>'</i>ll get incredible footage.

46
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,070
The people and the fun.
The excitement!

47
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,357
You haven<i>'</i>t worked with her yet.
She<i>'</i>s really nice.

48
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,597
I think she<i>'</i>ll be
a really good producer.

49
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,149
You guys are going to have fun.

50
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,353
She<i>'</i>s fun. But not my kind of fun.
I<i>'</i>ll be here for the 5:00.

51
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,837
Can you keep a secret, Larry?

52
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,437
I<i>'</i>m probably leaving PBH.

53
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,394
So this will be the last time...

54
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,153
...we do the Groundhog together.

55
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,520
What<i>'</i>s wrong with
the Groundhog Festival?

56
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,795
In San Diego...

57
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,555
...I covered the swallows returning
to Capistrano for six years.

58
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,193
Someone will see me interview
a groundhog and think I have no future.

59
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,391
I think it<i>'</i>s a nice story.

60
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,313
He comes out.
He looks around.

61
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,192
He wrinkles up his nose.

62
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,069
He sees his shadow or not.
It<i>'</i>s nice! People like it!

63
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,595
You are new, aren<i>'</i>t you?

64
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,350
People like blood sausage too.

65
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,035
People are morons!

66
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,198
Nice attitude.

67
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,592
Look in the mirror and see how you
look when you do that groundhog thing.

68
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,955
For me? Once?

69
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,789
He comes out, and there he
looks at his little shadow.

70
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,957
Want some blood sausage?
I have some...

71
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,991
I like blood sausage.

72
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,319
Rita, I can<i>'</i>t stay here.

73
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,994
Prima donna.

74
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,358
- What<i>'</i>s the matter?
- I hate this place.

75
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,120
I stayed here two years ago.
I was miserable.

76
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,834
- I won<i>'</i>t stay here.
- You<i>'</i>re not staying here.

77
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,149
I<i>'</i>m not?

78
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,314
Larry<i>'</i>s dropping me off.

79
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,988
I booked you in
a nice bed and breakfast.

80
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,109
Great.

81
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,356
I think this is one of the traits
of a good producer.

82
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,232
Keep the talent happy.

83
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,868
Anything I can do.

84
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,549
Would you help me
with my pelvic tilt?

85
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,870
Within reason. Want to come
to dinner with Larry and me?

86
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,154
No, thank you.
I<i>'</i>ve seen Larry eat.

87
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,074
You get your sleep.
See you in the morning.

88
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,239
Don<i>'</i>t be late.

89
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,829
Did he actually call himself
<i>"</i>the talent<i>"</i>?

90
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,270
<i>Campers, rise and shine!</i>
<i>Don't forget your booties,</i>

91
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,193
<i>- It's cold out there!</i>
<i>- It's cold every day!</i>

92
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,595
<i>- Is this Miami Beach?</i>
<i>- Not hardly!</i>

93
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,513
<i>Expect hazardous travel</i>
<i>later today with,,,</i>

94
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,113
<i>,,, that blizzard thing,</i>

95
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,352
<i>That blizzard thing,</i>
<i>Here's the report,</i>

96
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,752
<i>The National Weather Service</i>
<i>is calling for a big blizzard thing,</i>

97
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,633
<i>There's another reason</i>
<i>today's especially ex citing...</i>

98
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,512
<i>Especially cold,</i>

99
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,075
<i>The big question</i>
<i>on everybody's lips...</i>

100
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,880
<i>- Their chapped lips,</i>
<i>- On their chapped lips,</i>

101
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,594
<i>Will Phil come out</i>
<i>and see his shadow?</i>

102
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,991
<i>- Punxsutawney Phil!</i>
<i>- That's right, woodchuck chuckers!</i>

103
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,593
<i>It's Groundhog Day!</i>

104
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,752
<i>Get up and chuck me a hog!</i>

105
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,755
- Morning!
- Morning.

106
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,991
- Off to see the groundhog?
- I am.

107
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,191
Think it<i>'</i>ll be an early spring?

108
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,391
I<i>'</i>m predicting March 21 st.

109
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,759
Good guess!

110
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,476
I think that actually is
the first day of spring.

111
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,274
- Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?
- I slept alone, Mrs. Lancaster.

112
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,674
Like some coffee?

113
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,198
Is there any possibility of getting
an espresso or cappuccino?

114
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,311
I really don<i>'</i>t know...

115
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,990
How to spell espresso or cappuccino.
This looks fine.

116
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,310
I hope you enjoy the festivities.

117
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,677
- I<i>'</i>m sure I will.
- There<i>'</i>s talk of a blizzard.

118
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,277
We may catch a break and
it will blow right by.

119
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,590
The moisture coming
out of the south...

120
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,956
...by midday will
push on to the east.

121
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,950
At high altitudes it<i>'</i>ll crystallize
and give us what we call snow.

122
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,789
Our high will get to
about 30 today, teens tonight.

123
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,595
Chance of precipitation,
about 20% today, 20% tomorrow.

124
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,718
Did you want to talk about
the weather or just chitchat?

125
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,589
Chitchat.

126
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,319
See you later.

127
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,551
Will you be checking out today?

128
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,990
Chance of departure today, 100%.

129
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,149
Phil Connors!
I thought that was you!

130
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,555
How you doing?
Thanks for watching.

131
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,112
Don<i>'</i>t tell me you don<i>'</i>t remember me.
I sure as heckfire remember you.

132
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,189
Not a chance.

133
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,753
Ned!

134
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,432
Ryerson!

135
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,912
Needlenose Ned.
Ned the Head.

136
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,429
Come on, buddy,
Case Western High!

137
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,394
I did the whistling bellybutton
trick at the talent show.

138
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,316
Bing! Got the shingles real bad
senior year. Almost didn<i>'</i>t graduate.

139
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,397
Bing again!

140
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,513
I dated your sister a couple times
till you told me not to anymore.

141
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,948
Well?

142
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,590
Ned Ryerson?

143
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,750
Bing!

144
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,228
Bing.

145
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,838
Did you turn pro with
that bellybutton thing?

146
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,359
I sell insurance.

147
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,750
- What a shock.
- Do you have insurance?

148
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,837
If you do, you could
always use more.

149
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,554
Am I right or am I right
or am I right?

150
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,153
I would love to stand here
and talk with you.

151
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,588
But I<i>'</i>m not going to.

152
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,750
See you.

153
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,752
That<i>'</i>s all right!
I<i>'</i>ll walk with you.

154
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,758
I see an opportunity,
I charge it like a bull.

155
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,752
Ned the Bull, that<i>'</i>s me now.

156
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,390
I got friends who live and die
by the actuarial tables.

157
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,552
I say it<i>'</i>s all one big
crapshoot anyhoo.

158
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,470
Ever heard of single-premium life?
That could be the ticket for you.

159
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,073
Oh, God!

160
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,074
It is so good to see you!
What are you doing for dinner?

161
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,548
Something else.

162
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,116
It<i>'</i>s been great seeing you,
Needlehead. Take care.

163
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,590
Watch out for that first step.
It<i>'</i>s a doozy!

164
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,355
Phil!

165
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,118
Phil, over here!

166
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,759
Where have you been?

167
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,479
It was horrible.

168
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,551
A giant leech got me.

169
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,270
You<i>'</i>re missing all the fun.
These people are great!

170
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,990
Some of them partied all night.
They sing till they get cold.

171
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,714
Then they go sit by the fire
and get warm.

172
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,229
Then they come back
and sing some more!

173
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,758
They<i>'</i>re hicks, Rita.

174
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,795
So did you sleep okay without me?

175
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,712
You tossed and turned, didn<i>'</i>t you?

176
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,069
You<i>'</i>re incredible.

177
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,469
Who told you?

178
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,634
It<i>'</i>s groundhog time.

179
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,038
Okay.
On me in three...

180
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,878
...two, one.

181
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,351
Once a year, the eyes of the nation
turn to this tiny hamlet...

182
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,158
...to watch a master at work.

183
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,276
The master?

184
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,794
Punxsutawney Phil...

185
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,191
...the world<i>'</i>s most famous weatherman.
The groundhog.

186
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,399
Who, as legend has it,
can predict an early spring.

187
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,200
The question we have
to ask ourselves is:

188
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,351
<i>"</i> Does Phil feel lucky?<i>"</i>

189
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,359
Every year, the guy comes with
a big stick and raps on the door.

190
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,199
They pull the little rat out,
talk to him.

191
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,591
The rat talks back.
Then they tell us when it<i>'</i>ll end.

192
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,478
Isn<i>'</i>t he cute?

193
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,716
Do you like the guys
with the prominent upper teeth?

194
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,554
This February 2nd, at 7:20
and 30 seconds...

195
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,159
...Punxsutawney Phil...

196
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,879
...the seer of seers...

197
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,953
...prognosticator of prognosticators...

198
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,071
...emerged reluctantly...

199
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,309
...but alertly...

200
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,476
...in Punxsutawney, PA...

201
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,268
...and stated in groundhog-ese...

202
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,590
...<i>"</i> I definitely see a shadow.<i>"</i>

203
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,270
Sorry, folks.

204
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,988
Six more weeks of winter.

205
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,116
On me in three...

206
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,912
...two, one.

207
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,435
This is one time where
television fails...

208
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,393
...to capture the excitement
of a large squirrel...

209
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,789
...predicting the weather.

210
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,191
I<i>'</i>m grateful to have been here.
From Punxsutawney...

211
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,000
...this is Phil Connors.
So long.

212
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,270
Want to try it again
without the sarcasm?

213
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,954
We got it.
I<i>'</i>m out of here.

214
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,392
Prima donnas.

215
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,068
Oh, boy.
Take a look at this.

216
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,752
What is going on?

217
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,748
I don<i>'</i>t know. Perhaps that
blizzard we<i>'</i>re not supposed to get.

218
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,792
This is impossible.

219
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,598
Nobody honks this horn but me,
okay, pal?

220
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,553
Take it out of here.

221
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,276
Commander, what<i>'</i>s going on?

222
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,556
Nothing.
We<i>'</i>re closing the road.

223
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,236
- Big blizzard moving in.
- It<i>'</i>s a couple of flakes.

224
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,029
Don<i>'</i>t you listen to the weather?

225
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,152
I make the weather.

226
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,150
All this moisture from the Gulf
will push off to the east in Altoona.

227
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,749
You got that moisture on your head.

228
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,871
You can go back to Punxsutawney...

229
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,273
...or you can freeze to death.
It<i>'</i>s your choice.

230
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,556
So, what<i>'</i>s it going to be?

231
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,515
I<i>'</i>m thinking.

232
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,556
Come on, all the long-distance
lines are down?

233
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,759
What about the satellite?

234
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,831
Is it snowing in space?

235
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:20,112
Don<i>'</i>t you keep a line open
for emergencies or celebrities?

236
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,431
I<i>'</i>m both.
I<i>'</i>m a celebrity in an emergency.

237
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,315
Can you patch me through
on that line?

238
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,352
Could I have one more of these
with some booze in it?

239
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,953
I like it here.

240
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,271
Going to the groundhog dinner?

241
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,158
No, I had groundhog for lunch.

242
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,555
Wasn<i>'</i>t bad.
Tastes like chicken.

243
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,636
You two run along.

244
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,831
Looking foxy tonight, man.

245
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,397
Is your troop selling
cookies again this year?

246
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,868
That<i>'</i>s so funny.

247
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,519
So, what are you doing?

248
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,156
I think I<i>'</i>ll go back to my room...

249
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,790
...take a hot shower
and maybe read <i>Hustler,</i>

250
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,353
Suit yourself.

251
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,275
Yo, mom.

252
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,158
Isn<i>'</i>t there any hot water?

253
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,197
Oh, no, there wouldn<i>'</i>t be today.

254
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,795
Of course not.
Silly me.

255
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,399
Sweet dreams.

256
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,112
<i>Campers, rise and shine!</i>
<i>Don't forget your booties,</i>

257
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,397
<i>- It's cold out there!</i>
<i>- It's cold every day!</i>

258
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,392
<i>- Is this Miami Beach?</i>
<i>- Not hardly!</i>

259
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,791
Nice going, boys.
You<i>'</i>re playing yesterday<i>'</i>s tape.

260
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,439
<i>- With that blizzard thing,</i>

261
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,240
<i>That blizzard thing?</i>
<i>Here's the report,</i>

262
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,752
<i>The National Weather Service</i>
<i>is calling for a big blizzard thing,</i>

263
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,838
<i>There's another reason</i>
<i>today's especially ex citing...</i>

264
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,996
<i>Especially cold,</i>

265
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,310
<i>The big question</i>
<i>on everybody's lips...</i>

266
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,994
- Chapped lips.
<i>- Their chapped lips,</i>

267
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,993
<i>Will Phil come out</i>
<i>and see his shadow?</i>

268
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,397
<i>- Punxsutawney Phil!</i>
<i>- That's right, woodchuck chuckers!</i>

269
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,919
<i>It's Groundhog Day!</i>

270
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,758
<i>Get up and chuck me a hog!</i>

271
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,239
What the hell?

272
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,758
Morning!
Off to see the groundhog?

273
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,992
Think it<i>'</i>ll be an early spring?

274
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,637
Didn<i>'</i>t we do this yesterday?

275
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,639
I don<i>'</i>t know what you mean.

276
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,431
Don<i>'</i>t mess with me, Pork Chop!

277
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,758
- What day is this?
- It<i>'</i>s February 2nd.

278
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,479
Groundhog Day.

279
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,078
I<i>'</i>m sorry.
I thought it was yesterday.

280
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,591
Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?

281
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,798
Did I sleep well?

282
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,672
Like some coffee?

283
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,480
Yes, please.
I think I<i>'</i>ll have a double.

284
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,035
I hope you enjoy the festivities.

285
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,590
There<i>'</i>s talk of a blizzard.

286
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,230
Ever have dj vu,
Mrs. Lancaster?

287
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,994
I<i>'</i>ll check with the kitchen.

288
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,077
That<i>'</i>s okay.
Thank you.

289
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,040
Will you be checking out today?

290
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,358
I<i>'</i>d say the chance
of departure is 80 percent.

291
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,158
75-80.

292
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,559
Excuse me!

293
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,470
Excuse me.
Where<i>'</i>s everybody going?

294
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,439
To Gobbler<i>'</i>s Knob.

295
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,834
It<i>'</i>s Groundhog Day.

296
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,949
It<i>'</i>s still just once a year,
isn<i>'</i>t it?

297
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,990
Phil Connors!
I thought that was you!

298
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,390
My, oh my, Phil Connors!

299
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,394
Don<i>'</i>t say you don<i>'</i>t remember me.
I sure as heckfire remember you.

300
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,989
- Well?
- Ned Ryerson?

301
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,437
Bing! First shot
right out of the box!

302
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,154
So how<i>'</i>s it going, old buddy?

303
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,159
I<i>'</i>m not feeling well.
Would you excuse me?

304
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,996
It<i>'</i>s funny you should mention
your health. Guess what I do now.

305
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,151
Do you sell insurance?

306
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,159
Bing again!
You are sharp as a tack today!

307
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,152
Do you have life insurance?

308
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,595
If you do, you could
always use more.

309
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,671
Right! I mean, who couldn<i>'</i>t?

310
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,194
But you want to know something?

311
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,351
I gots a feeling...

312
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,193
...you ain<i>'</i>t got any.

313
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,159
Am I right or am I right
or am I right?

314
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,679
I got to go.

315
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,748
Watch out for that first step.
It<i>'</i>s a doozy!

316
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,672
Phil! Over here!

317
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,320
- Where have you been?
- Rita. Do me a favour.

318
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,512
I need someone to give me a
good, hard slap in the face.

319
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,473
How<i>'</i>s that?

320
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,476
Good!

321
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,270
If you need help with the other cheek,
I<i>'</i>m right here.

322
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,279
Something<i>'</i>s going on.

323
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,120
- Are you drunk or something?
- Drunk<i>'</i>s more fun.

324
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,271
Can I be serious with you
for a minute?

325
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,549
Can you?

326
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,512
I<i>'</i>m being serious!

327
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,594
I<i>'</i>m having a problem.
I may be having a problem.

328
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,955
It<i>'</i>s groundhog time.

329
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,310
See? I knew you<i>'</i>d say that!

330
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,199
I really feel...

331
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,793
...weird.

332
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,235
Let<i>'</i>s just do this.
Then we<i>'</i>ll talk.

333
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,873
All right, on me in three...

334
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,839
...two, one.

335
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,078
Well, it<i>'</i>s Groundhog Day...

336
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,594
...again...

337
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,593
...and that must mean we<i>'</i>re
up here at Gobbler<i>'</i>s Knob...

338
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,435
...waiting for the world<i>'</i>s most famous
groundhog<i>l</i>weatherman...

339
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,914
...Punxsutawney Phil...

340
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,948
...who<i>'</i>s about to tell us how much more
winter to expect.

341
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,759
This is a riot!

342
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,275
Isn<i>'</i>t he cute?

343
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,069
This February 2nd, at 7:20
and 30 seconds...

344
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,837
...Punxsutawney Phil,
the seer of seers...

345
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,794
...prognosticator of prognosticators...

346
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,918
...emerged reluctantly...

347
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,310
...but alertly in Punxsu...

348
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,676
Oh, my gosh!

349
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,071
I know there<i>'</i>s a blizzard.

350
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,278
When will the long-distance
lines be repaired?

351
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,073
What if there is no tomorrow?
There wasn<i>'</i>t one today.

352
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,795
Morning!

353
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,519
Off to see the groundhog?

354
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,831
Did you sleep well, Mr...

355
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,676
Phil Connors! I thought...

356
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,277
Don<i>'</i>t say you don<i>'</i>t remember me.
I sure as heckfire remember you!

357
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,471
It<i>'</i>s me, Ned! Ryerson!

358
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,069
Needlenose Ned! Ned the Head!

359
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,708
Phil! Over here!

360
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,873
Can I talk to you?
It<i>'</i>s not work-related.

361
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,878
- You never talk about work.
- We have to talk.

362
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,072
- It<i>'</i>s a creative meeting.
- We<i>'</i>ve got work to do!

363
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,589
I don<i>'</i>t.
I<i>'</i>ve already done it twice.

364
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,673
When you get finished,
meet me in the diner.

365
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,998
- What<i>'</i>s that all about?
- I don<i>'</i>t know.

366
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,753
Prima donnas.

367
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,155
More coffee?

368
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,035
Just the check, please.
These sticky buns are heaven.

369
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,673
Aren<i>'</i>t they?

370
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,355
Just put that anywhere, pal!

371
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,073
Good save!

372
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,837
Tell me why you<i>'</i>re too sick to work.
It better be good.

373
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,669
I<i>'</i>m reliving the same day
over and over.

374
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,270
Groundhog Day. Today.

375
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,877
Okay. I<i>'</i>m waiting for the punch line.

376
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,913
Really! This is the third time!

377
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,037
It<i>'</i>s like yesterday never happened!

378
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,075
I<i>'</i>m racking my brain trying to imagine
why you<i>'</i>d make this up.

379
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,520
I<i>'</i>m not making it up.
I<i>'</i>m asking for help!

380
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,957
What do you want me to do?

381
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,357
I don<i>'</i>t know! You<i>'</i>re a producer.
Come up with something.

382
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,074
You should get
your head examined...

383
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,471
...if you expect me to believe
a stupid story like that!

384
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,398
Phil? Like the groundhog Phil?

385
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,188
Yeah. Like the groundhog Phil.

386
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,910
Look out for your shadow, pal!

387
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,591
Morons, your bus is leaving!

388
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,110
You guys ready? We better go,
to stay ahead of the weather.

389
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,717
- Let<i>'</i>s talk about it in Pittsburgh.
- I<i>'</i>m not going back to Pittsburgh.

390
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,116
- Why not?
- Because of the blizzard!

391
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,709
You said it was going
to hit Altoona.

392
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,480
I know that<i>'</i>s what I said.

393
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,076
I think you need help.

394
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,798
That<i>'</i>s what I<i>'</i>ve been saying.
I need help.

395
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,312
No spots.

396
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,915
No clots, no tumours.

397
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,479
No lesions.

398
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,193
No aneurisms.

399
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,919
At least none that I can see.

400
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,869
If you want a CAT scan or an MRI,
you<i>'</i>ll have to go into Pittsburgh.

401
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,196
I can<i>'</i>t go into Pittsburgh.

402
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,876
- Why can<i>'</i>t you go into Pittsburgh?
- I told you, there<i>'</i>s a blizzard.

403
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,274
Right. The blizzard!

404
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,080
You know what you may need,
Mr. Connors?

405
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,114
A biopsy.

406
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,278
A psychiatrist.

407
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,314
That<i>'</i>s an unusual problem...

408
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,595
...Mr. Connors.

409
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,831
Most of my work is with couples,
families. I have an alcoholic now.

410
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,752
You went to college, right?

411
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,190
It wasn<i>'</i>t veterinary
psychology, was it?

412
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,273
Didn<i>'</i>t you take a course that
covered this stuff?

413
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,869
Sort of, I guess.

414
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,152
Abnormal psychology.

415
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,437
So...

416
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,748
...what do I do?

417
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,834
We should meet again.

418
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,671
How<i>'</i>s tomorrow for you?

419
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,639
Is that not good?

420
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,713
I was in the Virgin Islands once.

421
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,871
I met a girl.

422
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,308
We ate lobster.

423
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,471
Drank pia coladas.

424
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,154
At sunset, we made love
like sea otters.

425
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,070
That was a pretty good day.

426
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,072
Why couldn<i>'</i>t I get that day...

427
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,349
...over...

428
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,676
...and over and over?

429
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,669
Some guys would look
at this glass and say:

430
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,279
<i>"</i>That glass is half empty.<i>"</i>

431
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,149
Other guys would say,
<i>"</i>That glass is half full.<i>"</i>

432
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,597
I peg you as a <i>"</i>glass is half empty<i>"</i>
kind of guy. Right?

433
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,717
What would you do if you were
stuck in one place...

434
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,714
...and every day was exactly the same,
and nothing you did mattered?

435
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,839
That about sums it up for me.

436
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,075
Good luck.

437
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,673
I<i>'</i>ll drop you off.

438
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,876
This thing sticks a little bit.

439
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,553
You got to jiggle it...

440
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,870
Come on up here, pal.

441
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,435
Give me your keys, pal.
Give me the keys.

442
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,279
Friends don<i>'</i>t let friends drive, right?
Stand up here.

443
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,313
Take a deep breath. You feel okay?

444
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,879
You<i>'</i>re all right.

445
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,680
You want to throw up here
or in the car?

446
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,474
I think, both.

447
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,077
I don<i>'</i>t think I should drive.

448
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,117
I don<i>'</i>t either.

449
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,679
Watch your head.

450
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,917
Watch your knees.
Don<i>'</i>t break anything.

451
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,196
Let<i>'</i>s not forget seat belts.

452
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,072
Who else could go for some
flapjacks right now?

453
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,758
Let me ask you a question.

454
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,830
Shoot.

455
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,191
What if there were no tomorrow?

456
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,871
No tomorrow? That means there<i>'</i>d be
no consequences...

457
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,599
...no hangovers.

458
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,195
We could do whatever we wanted!

459
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,879
That<i>'</i>s true.

460
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,072
We could do whatever we want.

461
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,830
If we wanted to hit mailboxes
we could let Ralph drive!

462
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,873
They want you to stop.

463
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:19,956
Hang on!

464
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,391
It<i>'</i>s the same thing
your whole life.

465
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,638
<i>"</i> Clean up your room! Stand up
straight! Pick up your feet!

466
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,559
Take it like a man!

467
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,352
Be nice to your sister!

468
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,549
Don<i>'</i>t mix beer and wine, ever!

469
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,396
Don<i>'</i>t drive on the railroad tracks!<i>"</i>

470
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,148
That<i>'</i>s one I agree with.

471
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,396
I don<i>'</i>t know, Gus.

472
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,279
Sometimes I think you just have to...

473
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,795
...take the big chances.

474
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,270
<i>This is the police! Pull over now!</i>

475
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,716
We<i>'</i>re talking in here!

476
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,511
I bet he swerves first.

477
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,311
I<i>'</i>m not going to live by
their rules anymore!

478
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,078
I noticed that.

479
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,714
You make choices
and you live with them.

480
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,795
My knee!

481
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,278
Let me handle this.

482
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,399
Three cheeseburgers,
two large fries...

483
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,551
...two chocolate shakes
and one large Coke.

484
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,671
And some flapjacks!

485
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,672
Too early for flapjacks?

486
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,908
Yes!

487
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,672
Rise and shine, campers!

488
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,798
Don<i>'</i>t forget your booties!
It<i>'</i>s cold out there today!

489
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,359
It<i>'</i>s cold every day.

490
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,558
What is this, Miami Beach?
Not hardly!

491
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,313
Slept like a baby.

492
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,471
I<i>'</i>d love some of your coffee.

493
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,438
- I hope...
- Flurries moving in later...

494
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,710
...but the blizzard<i>'</i>s going to hit
outside of town.

495
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,915
Mrs. Lancaster?

496
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,355
Was anybody looking for me
here this morning?

497
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,876
Perhaps a state official?
Maybe a blue hat, gun, nightstick?

498
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,878
No, no one like that!
Will there be?

499
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,672
Apparently not.

500
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,951
Will you hold my room for me?
I<i>'</i>m staying an extra day.

501
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,471
Catch you tomorrow, pops.

502
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,876
- Phil Connors!
- Ned?

503
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,156
I like to see a man of advancing years
throw caution to the wind.

504
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,555
It<i>'</i>s inspiring, in a way.

505
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,675
My years are not advancing
as fast as you think.

506
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,116
More coffee?

507
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,875
Keep it coming.

508
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,269
Sure thing.

509
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,315
Just put that anywhere, pal!

510
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,874
Good save!

511
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,475
Don<i>'</i>t you worry about cholesterol,
lung cancer, love handles?

512
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,358
I don<i>'</i>t worry anymore.

513
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,995
What makes you special?
Everybody worries.

514
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,954
That<i>'</i>s exactly what makes me
so special.

515
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,878
I don<i>'</i>t even have to floss.

516
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,110
What?

517
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,475
<i>"</i>The wretch, concentred all in self

518
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,110
<i>"</i> Living, shall forfeit fair renown

519
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,318
<i>"</i>And doubly dying, shall go down

520
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,398
<i>"</i>To the vile dust from whence he sprung

521
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,959
<i>"</i> Unwept...

522
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,515
<i>"</i>... unhonoured and unsung<i>"</i>

523
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,076
Sir Walter Scott.

524
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,433
You don<i>'</i>t like poetry?

525
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,479
I love poetry!

526
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,672
I just thought that was Willard Scott.
I was confused.

527
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,515
You think I act like this
because I<i>'</i>m egocentric?

528
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,797
You are egocentric.
It<i>'</i>s your defining characteristic.

529
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,475
You guys ready? We better go,
to stay ahead of the weather.

530
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,510
Thanks, Larry.

531
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,876
Would you like a doggie bag?

532
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,673
I<i>'</i>ll stay and finish.

533
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,075
I thought you hated this town.

534
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,077
It<i>'</i>s beginning to grow on me.

535
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,588
Larry, quit staring.

536
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,673
- These are excellent.
<i>- Bon apptit,</i>

537
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,870
You see the groundhog
this morning?

538
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,072
I never miss it.

539
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,873
What<i>'</i>s your name?

540
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,671
Nancy Taylor. And you are?

541
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,314
- What high school did you go to?
- What?

542
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,509
High school.

543
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,308
Lincoln, in Pittsburgh.
Who are you?

544
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,592
Who was your 12th grade
English teacher?

545
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,159
Are you kidding?

546
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,516
In 12th grade,
your English teacher was...

547
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,551
Mrs. Walsh.

548
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,672
Nancy. Lincoln. Walsh.

549
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,276
Thanks very much.

550
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,273
Nancy?

551
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,475
Nancy Taylor!

552
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,076
Lincoln High School!

553
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,677
I sat next to you in
Mrs. Walsh<i>'</i>s English class!

554
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,271
- I<i>'</i>m sorry.
- Phil Connors!

555
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,869
- That<i>'</i>s amazing!
- You don<i>'</i>t remember me?

556
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,039
I asked you to the prom.

557
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,912
Phil Connors?

558
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,556
I was short and I<i>'</i>ve sprouted.

559
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,432
How are you?

560
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,109
Great.

561
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,998
You look terrific!

562
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,317
You look very, very terrific!

563
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,069
Listen, I got to go do this report.

564
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,474
Are you a reporter?

565
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,069
A weatherman with
Channel 9, Pittsburgh.

566
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,151
I should have known! That<i>'</i>s great!

567
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,032
But maybe later we could...

568
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,434
Yeah, whatever!

569
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,352
Stay right here.

570
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,797
Promise me?
I<i>'</i>ll be right back. Wish me luck!

571
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,678
Good luck!

572
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,068
Oh, Phil.

573
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,399
Oh, Rita.

574
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,269
Who<i>'</i>s Rita?

575
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,273
How should I know?

576
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,994
What is this,
some kind of one-night stand?

577
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,117
On the contrary, Nancy...

578
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,477
...I love you.
I<i>'</i>ve always loved you.

579
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,629
This is going to seem sudden but...

580
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,871
...Nancy, will you be my wife?

581
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,879
Rita.

582
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,069
- Nancy.
- Whatever.

583
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,476
A gust of wind.

584
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,878
A dog barks.

585
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,559
Cue the truck.

586
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,109
Exit Herman.

587
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,597
Walk on to the bank.

588
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:48,719
Exit Felix, and stand there with a
not-so-bright look on your face.

589
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,471
All right, Doris. Come on.

590
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,918
Fix your bra, honey.
That<i>'</i>s better.

591
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,233
Felix!

592
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,833
How you doing, Doris?

593
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,508
Can I have a roll of quarters?

594
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:08,117
Ten... nine... eight...

595
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,074
...car...

596
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,238
...six... five...

597
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,516
...quarters...

598
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,316
...three... two...

599
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,915
Felix?

600
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:31,556
- Did I bring out two bags or one?
- I don<i>'</i>t know.

601
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,154
I thought we were going
to a costume party.

602
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,153
It<i>'</i>s like I said, I love this film.

603
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,516
I<i>'</i>ve seen it over 100 times.

604
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,715
Phil!

605
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,154
Told you...

606
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,550
...call me <i>"</i> Bronco.<i>"</i>

607
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,518
Sorry, Bronco.

608
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,312
Hi, Nancy.

609
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,237
My own fiance...

610
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,516
...doesn<i>'</i>t remember me.

611
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,954
That<i>'</i>ll be one adult and...

612
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,317
- Two adults.
- Two adults, I guess.

613
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,915
<i>- Groundhog who, as legend has it,</i>
<i>can predict an early spring,</i>

614
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,759
<i>The question we have</i>
<i>to ask ourselves today is,</i>

615
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,877
<i>"Does Phil feel lucky?"</i>

616
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,753
Rita, if you only
had one day to live...

617
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,558
...what would you do?

618
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,234
I don<i>'</i>t know.
What are you dying of?

619
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,758
No, the whole world
is about to explode.

620
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,915
What do you do?

621
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,355
I want to know
where to put the camera.

622
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,949
What are you looking for?
A date for the weekend?

623
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,919
No, I<i>'</i>m just interested in you.

624
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,310
What do you want?
What do you like?

625
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,317
What do you think about?

626
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,755
What kind of men
are you interested in?

627
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,712
What do you do for fun?

628
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,477
Are you trying to
make me look like a fool?

629
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:22,719
I<i>'</i>m trying to talk like normal people.
Isn<i>'</i>t this how they talk?

630
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,150
- Close.
- Okay, so talk to me.

631
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,516
Let me buy you a cup of coffee.

632
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,550
And a doughnut.

633
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,318
All right.

634
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,511
<i>So what do you want out of life?</i>

635
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,510
I guess I want what everybody wants.

636
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,110
Career, love, marriage, children.

637
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,919
Are you seeing anyone?

638
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,871
This is getting too personal.
I<i>'</i>m not ready to share this with you.

639
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,150
How about you?
What do you want?

640
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,431
What I really want
is someone like you.

641
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,908
Oh, please!

642
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,230
Why not? What are you looking for?

643
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,754
Who<i>'</i>s your perfect guy?

644
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:08,914
First of all, he<i>'</i>s too humble
to know he<i>'</i>s perfect.

645
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,519
That<i>'</i>s me!

646
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,957
He<i>'</i>s intelligent,
supportive, funny...

647
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,316
Intelligent, supportive, funny.

648
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,757
Me, me, me.

649
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,673
He<i>'</i>s romantic and courageous.

650
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,114
Me also.

651
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,116
He<i>'</i>s got a good body but doesn<i>'</i>t
have to look in the mirror often.

652
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,390
I have a great body, and sometimes
I go months without looking.

653
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,156
He<i>'</i>s kind, sensitive and gentle.

654
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,432
He<i>'</i>s not afraid to cry.

655
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,148
This is a man
we<i>'</i>re talking about, right?

656
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:50,155
He likes animals, children,
and he<i>'</i>ll change poopy diapers.

657
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,675
Does he have to use the word <i>"</i> poopy<i>"</i>?

658
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,470
He plays an instrument,
and he loves his mother.

659
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,319
I am really close on this one.

660
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,719
Really, really close.

661
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,513
It<i>'</i>s Phil Connors!

662
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:11,948
Hello.

663
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,912
Thanks for watching.

664
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:29,357
What are the chances
of getting out today?

665
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,750
Van won<i>'</i>t start.
Larry<i>'</i>s working on it.

666
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,353
Wouldn<i>'</i>t you know it?

667
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,318
Can I buy you a drink?

668
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,400
Jim Beam, ice, water.

669
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,269
For you, miss?

670
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,917
Sweet vermouth on the rocks
with a twist, please.

671
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,150
What are the chances
of getting out today?

672
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,709
Van won<i>'</i>t start.
Larry<i>'</i>s working on it.

673
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,518
Wouldn<i>'</i>t you know it?

674
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,517
Can I buy you a drink?

675
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,874
Sweet vermouth, rocks,
with a twist, please.

676
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:05,910
For you, miss?

677
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,713
The same.

678
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,112
That<i>'</i>s my favourite drink.

679
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,032
Mine too!

680
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,759
It makes me think of Rome.

681
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,117
The way the sun hits
the buildings in the afternoon.

682
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,711
What should we drink to?

683
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,751
To the groundhog!

684
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,514
I always drink to world peace.

685
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,911
Can I buy you a drink?

686
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,632
Sweet vermouth, rocks,
with a twist, please.

687
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,918
For you, miss?

688
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,752
The same.

689
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,759
That<i>'</i>s my favourite drink.

690
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,513
Mine too!

691
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,830
It makes me think of Rome.

692
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:57,709
The way the sun hits
the buildings in the afternoon.

693
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,512
What should we drink to?

694
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,517
I<i>'</i>d like to say a prayer
and drink to world peace.

695
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,118
To world peace.

696
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:21,957
- This is wonderful!
- See? Didn<i>'</i>t I tell you?

697
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,116
How do you know so much
about Punxsutawney?

698
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,629
I spent a lot of time here.

699
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,836
Small-town people are
more real, down-to-earth.

700
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,355
- That<i>'</i>s how I feel!
- Really?

701
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,552
- Some white chocolate?
- Yuck, don<i>'</i>t make me sick.

702
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,915
No white chocolate.

703
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,918
There is something
so familiar about this.

704
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,151
Do you ever have dj vu?

705
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,516
Didn<i>'</i>t you just ask me that?

706
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:50,756
People place too much
emphasis on their careers.

707
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,997
I wish we could all live
in the mountains.

708
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,634
That<i>'</i>s where I see myself
in five years.

709
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:57,756
How about you?

710
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,719
I agree. I just like
to go with the flow.

711
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,911
See where it leads me.

712
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,912
Well, it<i>'</i>s led you here.

713
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:10,115
It<i>'</i>s about a million miles
from where I started in college.

714
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:13,716
You weren<i>'</i>t in broadcasting
or journalism?

715
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:18,719
Believe it or not, I studied
19th-century French poetry.

716
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,513
What a waste of time!

717
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,553
I mean, for someone else
that<i>'</i>d be a total waste.

718
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,756
So bold of you to choose that.

719
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,515
It<i>'</i>s incredible.
You must be a very strong person.

720
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,556
People place too much
emphasis on their careers.

721
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:39,157
I wish we could all
live in the mountains.

722
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,550
That<i>'</i>s where I see myself
in five years.

723
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,715
How about you?

724
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,714
I agree. I like to go
with the flow, see what happens.

725
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,155
Well, it<i>'</i>s gotten you here.

726
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,752
It<i>'</i>s a million miles
from where I started in college.

727
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,310
You weren<i>'</i>t in broadcasting
or journalism or anything like that?

728
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:01,313
Believe it or not, I studied
19th-century French poetry.

729
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:18,788
You speak French!

730
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,960
I haven<i>'</i>t done this since I was a kid.

731
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,918
Me neither. It<i>'</i>s fun!

732
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,190
Clean fun.

733
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,316
I hope one day I can do this
with my own children.

734
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,750
Where<i>'</i>d you get that?

735
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,514
Well, I went over
to the snowman shop.

736
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,759
Hey, an assassin!

737
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,713
I<i>'</i>ll protect you!

738
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,839
I shall die for you.
You shall not take her!

739
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,268
Find cover!

740
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,750
I<i>'</i>m getting some good ones.

741
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,713
That<i>'</i>s a boy! Good try.

742
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,512
Help me!

743
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,315
What?

744
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:02,439
I<i>'</i>m just amazed,
and I<i>'</i>m not easily amazed.

745
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,033
About what?

746
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:06,919
How you can start a day with one
kind of expectation...

747
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,111
...and end up
so completely different.

748
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,517
Do you like the way
this day is turning out?

749
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,029
I like it very much.

750
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:19,636
It<i>'</i>s a perfect day.
You couldn<i>'</i>t plan a day like this.

751
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,074
Well, you can.

752
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,158
It just takes an awful lot of work.

753
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,516
Come in.
I want to show you something.

754
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,915
- I don<i>'</i>t think I should.
- I agree.

755
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:33,312
That<i>'</i>s why I want to show you one thing,
then kick you right out.

756
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,310
It<i>'</i>s just lovely.

757
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,919
Would you like to sit
and stare at the fake fire?

758
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,516
It<i>'</i>s a really wonderful room.

759
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,512
It is now.

760
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,515
I don<i>'</i>t think we should do this.

761
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,318
I don<i>'</i>t either.

762
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,514
On second thought,
I think we should.

763
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:24,357
It<i>'</i>s the perfect end
to a perfect day.

764
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,718
Well, it<i>'</i>s a little fast for me.

765
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,313
Me too.

766
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,910
Maybe I should go.

767
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,951
Where would you go?

768
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,519
Why?

769
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,915
We<i>'</i>ve got a perfect fire.

770
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:41,112
I<i>'</i>ve got some French poetry here.
Baudelaire...

771
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,033
I will read to you.

772
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:48,719
I<i>'</i>ve got some ice cream on
the windowsill. Hold on a minute.

773
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,109
Rocky road.

774
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,839
I love rocky road.

775
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,911
Yeah, I thought so.

776
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,838
You have to stay.

777
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:04,709
No, really, I<i>'</i>m tired.
We can see each other tomorrow.

778
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,555
No, tonight.
It<i>'</i>s got to be tonight.

779
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,513
No, Phil, really.

780
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,517
Just stay for a while and
if you like it, stay longer.

781
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,756
And if you like that, stay longer.

782
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,757
Let<i>'</i>s not spoil it, okay?

783
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,309
I don<i>'</i>t want to spoil it either.

784
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:25,318
You know I can<i>'</i>t stay with you.

785
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,518
Why not? I love you.

786
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,516
You love me?

787
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:36,719
- You don<i>'</i>t even know me.
- I know you.

788
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,033
Oh, no. I can<i>'</i>t believe
I fell for this!

789
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,555
This whole day has been
one long setup.

790
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:44,710
No, it hasn<i>'</i>t.

791
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,599
And I hate fudge. Yuck!

792
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,836
No white chocolate, no fudge.

793
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,676
What are you doing?
Are you making some kind of list?

794
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,952
Did you call my friends
and ask them what I like?

795
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,556
- Is this what love is for you?
- This is real. This is love.

796
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,159
Stop saying that!

797
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,239
You must be crazy.

798
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,029
I could never love you because
you<i>'</i>ll never love anyone but yourself.

799
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:11,996
I don<i>'</i>t even like myself.
Give me another chance.

800
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,114
That<i>'</i>s for making me
care about you.

801
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,155
I haven<i>'</i>t done this
since I was a kid.

802
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,355
It<i>'</i>s fun!

803
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:30,712
And good, clean fun too.
That<i>'</i>s what<i>'</i>s missing in the world.

804
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,554
I can<i>'</i>t wait to do this
with my own children.

805
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,239
I want lots of kids!

806
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:39,155
I want to adopt, I want my own kids,
I want to have foster kids.

807
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,550
I got this at Snowman City.

808
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,519
Hey! Some kid just
threw a snowball at us.

809
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:47,479
Come here! Let<i>'</i>s have some fun!

810
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,273
I wish these were my own kids.

811
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,314
Are any of you up for adoption?

812
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,309
Here<i>'</i>s a humdinger over here!

813
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,516
Wasn<i>'</i>t that great?

814
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,158
Stop it!

815
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,031
Phil! Over here!

816
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,834
Where have you been?
You<i>'</i>re missing the fun.

817
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,877
Phil, you look terrible.

818
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,909
What happened? Rough night?

819
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,992
Okay, campers.

820
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,152
Rise and shine.

821
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,515
Don<i>'</i>t forget your booties,
because it<i>'</i>s cold out there.

822
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,709
It<i>'</i>s cold out there every day.

823
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:41,075
<i>This country's largest lake,</i>
<i>Chapala, is located near Guadalajara,</i>

824
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,235
What is Mexico?

825
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,429
<i>What is Mexico?</i>

826
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,512
<i>- Correct,</i>
<i>- Lakes and Rivers, 400,</i>

827
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,320
<i>Seneca is the largest</i>
<i>of these lakes,</i>

828
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:51,393
What are the Finger Lakes?

829
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:54,433
<i>- What are the Finger Lakes?</i>
<i>- Correct,</i>

830
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:58,633
<i>- This lake in Bolivia...</i>
- What is Titicaca?

831
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,552
<i>- What is Titicaca?</i>
<i>- Correct,</i>

832
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:01,670
For 1,000.

833
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:03,711
<i>- Milky-coloured...</i>
- The Rhone.

834
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,518
<i>,,, when entering Lake Geneva,,,</i>

835
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,194
<i>,,, this river is</i>
<i>clear blue upon exiting,</i>

836
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,310
<i>- Jim?</i>
<i>- The Rhone,</i>

837
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:10,834
<i>Good for $1, 000,</i>

838
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:13,389
<i>You're $500 off the lead right now,</i>

839
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,672
This is pitiful.

840
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,353
A thousand people...

841
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:22,478
...freezing their butts off,
waiting to worship a rat.

842
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,193
What a hype.

843
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:28,719
They used to pull the hog out,
and they used to eat it.

844
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,912
You<i>'</i>re hypocrites! All of you!

845
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:35,599
You got a problem, Larry?

846
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:37,796
Untie your tongue.

847
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,275
Come here and talk.
Am I upsetting you...

848
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,629
...princess?

849
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:43,558
You want a prediction
about the weather?

850
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,360
You<i>'</i>re asking the wrong Phil.

851
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:49,160
I<i>'</i>ll give you a winter prediction.

852
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,356
It<i>'</i>s going to be cold.

853
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,716
It<i>'</i>s going to be gray.

854
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:58,516
And it<i>'</i>s going to last you
for the rest of your life.

855
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,515
Once again the eyes of the nation
have turned here...

856
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,117
...to this tiny village
in Western Pennsylvania.

857
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:42,118
There is no way that this winter...

858
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:45,113
...is ever going to end...

859
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:49,108
...as long as this groundhog
keeps seeing his shadow.

860
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:51,157
I don<i>'</i>t see any other way out.

861
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,717
He<i>'</i>s got to be stopped.

862
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:56,479
And I have to stop it.

863
00:57:58,920 --> 00:57:59,716
Real good, Phil.

864
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,154
Real good.

865
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:04,193
He<i>'</i>s out of his gourd.

866
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:11,911
I<i>'</i>m worried. There<i>'</i>s something
really wrong with Phil.

867
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,720
There<i>'</i>s a lot of things
wrong with Phil.

868
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:17,994
Hi, Phil.

869
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,436
I<i>'</i>ve come to the end of me.

870
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,716
There<i>'</i>s no way out now.

871
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:27,317
Just remember, we had
a beautiful day together once.

872
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:31,953
All right, little fellow.

873
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:35,431
Good job. He just smiled at me!
Did you see that?

874
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,113
I believe he did.

875
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,719
Okay, little fellow.
There you go.

876
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,915
Hi, there. Something I can
do you for?

877
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,231
Hey! What are you doing?

878
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,756
Get the word out.
Somebody kidnapped Phil!

879
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,394
We are going after him!

880
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,109
Why would anybody steal a groundhog?

881
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:08,312
I could think of reasons.

882
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:09,430
Pervert.

883
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,118
He must have just snapped!

884
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:37,594
This ought to be good.

885
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:41,074
What is he doing?

886
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,759
What can he be thinking?

887
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:44,913
Not bad for a quadruped.

888
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:48,914
Check your mirrors. Side of your eye.
Side of your eye.

889
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,153
That<i>'</i>s it.

890
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,312
Hey, they<i>'</i>re chasing us!
Come on, make it fun.

891
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,315
Don<i>'</i>t drive angry.

892
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:09,669
Don<i>'</i>t drive angry.

893
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,633
There<i>'</i>s no way out
except the way we came in!

894
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:33,279
We got him now!

895
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:52,949
What is he doing?

896
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,155
I don<i>'</i>t know.

897
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,993
If you got to shoot,
don<i>'</i>t hit the groundhog.

898
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,272
Mustn<i>'</i>t keep them waiting.

899
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:11,754
It<i>'</i>s showtime.

900
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,108
On me in three...

901
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:21,956
...two...

902
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:24,710
...one.

903
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:38,949
Phil!

904
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,519
He might be okay.

905
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,394
Well, no. Probably not now.

906
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:05,594
Nuts.

907
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,998
Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?

908
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,592
Would you like...

909
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,553
...some toast?

910
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,151
Oh, my God!

911
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:12,719
That<i>'</i>s him.

912
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:19,036
He was a really, really great guy.

913
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,918
I really, really liked him...

914
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:22,309
...a lot.

915
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:31,271
I<i>'</i>m sorry?
What was that again?

916
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:34,319
- I<i>'</i>m a god.
- You<i>'</i>re God?

917
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:37,637
I<i>'</i>m a god. I<i>'</i>m not the god,
I don<i>'</i>t think.

918
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,236
Because you survived a car wreck?

919
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:41,555
You folks ready to order?

920
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,872
I didn<i>'</i>t just survive a wreck.
I wasn<i>'</i>t just blown up.

921
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,748
I have been stabbed,
shot, poisoned...

922
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:51,157
...frozen, hung, electrocuted
and burned.

923
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,634
Oh, really.

924
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:56,919
Every morning I wake up without a
scratch, not a dent in the fender.

925
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,635
I am an immortal.

926
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:01,354
Special today is blueberry waffles.

927
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,312
Why are you telling me this?

928
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:05,636
Because I want you to believe in me.

929
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,114
You are not a god.

930
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:10,596
Take my word. It<i>'</i>s 12 years
of Catholic school talking.

931
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:12,997
I can come back if you<i>'</i>re not ready.

932
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,111
How do you know I<i>'</i>m not a god?

933
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:16,514
Please.

934
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,990
- How do you know?
- It<i>'</i>s not possible.

935
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,872
I<i>'</i>ll come back.

936
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:22,394
Doris.

937
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:28,148
This is Doris.
Her brother-in-law owns this diner.

938
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:31,915
She<i>'</i>s worked here since she was 17.
She wants to see Paris...

939
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:33,269
...before she dies.

940
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:34,390
Boy, would I!

941
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:37,160
- What are you doing?
- Debbie and her fianc.

942
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:38,594
Do I know you?

943
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:41,553
They<i>'</i>re supposed to get married.
She<i>'</i>s having second thoughts.

944
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:42,915
What?

945
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:44,229
Lovely ring.

946
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:49,110
Bill<i>'</i>s been a waiter three years,
since he left Penn State to work.

947
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:52,318
He likes the town,
paints toy soldiers, and he<i>'</i>s gay.

948
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:53,509
I am.

949
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:56,759
Gus hates it here,
wishes he<i>'</i>d stayed in the Navy.

950
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,434
I could<i>'</i>ve retired
on half pay after 20 years.

951
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,432
Excuse me. Is this a trick?

952
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:05,355
Maybe the real God uses tricks.
Maybe he<i>'</i>s not omnipotent...

953
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,431
...he just knows everything.

954
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:08,954
- Who<i>'</i>s that?
- Tom.

955
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,111
He worked in the coal mine
till it closed.

956
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:12,435
- And her?
- Alice.

957
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:15,114
Came from Ireland when she
was a baby. Lived in Erie.

958
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:16,156
He<i>'</i>s right.

959
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:17,713
- And her?
- Nancy.

960
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:21,748
Works in a shop, makes noises like
a chipmunk when she gets excited.

961
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,638
- It<i>'</i>s true.
- How do you know this?

962
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:25,518
I told you, I know everything.

963
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:28,513
In five seconds, a waiter
will drop a tray.

964
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,359
- Five, four, three, two, one.
- This is nuts.

965
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,909
- Okay?
- Okay, that<i>'</i>s enough.

966
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:39,036
What about me?
Do you know me too?

967
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:43,319
I know all about you. You hope
for more than Channel 9 Pittsburgh.

968
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,829
Well, everyone knows that.

969
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,668
You like boats but not the ocean.

970
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:52,311
You go to a lake in the summer
with your family.

971
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:56,314
There<i>'</i>s a dock and a boathouse
with boards missing from the roof...

972
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,798
...and a place you used to
crawl underneath to be alone.

973
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:03,517
You<i>'</i>re a sucker for
French poetry and rhinestones.

974
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,553
You<i>'</i>re very generous.

975
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:08,189
You<i>'</i>re kind to strangers
and children.

976
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:11,439
When you stand in the snow
you look like an angel.

977
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:13,359
How are you doing this?

978
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,233
I told you. I wake up every day.

979
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:19,072
Right here.

980
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:22,556
Right in Punxsutawney.
And it<i>'</i>s always February 2nd.

981
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:25,909
And there<i>'</i>s nothing
I can do about it.

982
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:29,558
If you still can<i>'</i>t believe me, listen:

983
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:31,711
In 10 seconds...

984
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:35,510
...Larry is going to come
and take you away from me.

985
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,512
But you can<i>'</i>t let him.

986
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:41,392
Please believe me.
You<i>'</i>ve got to believe me.

987
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:50,114
You guys ready? We better go,
to stay ahead of the weather.

988
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:51,914
What<i>'</i>s that?

989
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,109
<i>"</i>... to stay ahead of the weather.<i>"</i>

990
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:04,313
Maybe it really is happening.
How else could you know so much?

991
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,909
There is no way.
I<i>'</i>m not that smart.

992
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,150
Maybe I should
spend the day with you...

993
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:13,710
...as an objective witness,
just to see what happens.

994
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:16,315
This sounds like a science project.

995
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,549
Concentrate.

996
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,518
You got to want it.

997
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:22,951
You got to want it, Rita.

998
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:27,109
Come on. It<i>'</i>s more
in the wrist than the fingers.

999
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:36,832
Be the hat. Come on, go.

1000
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:39,913
- It<i>'</i>d take me a year to get good.
- Six months.

1001
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:43,277
Four to five hours a day,
and you<i>'</i>d be an expert.

1002
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:47,230
- Is this what you do with eternity?
- Now you know.

1003
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:50,556
That<i>'</i>s not the worst part.

1004
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,153
What<i>'</i>s the worst part?

1005
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,311
The worst part is that...

1006
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:56,954
...tomorrow you<i>'</i>ll have
forgotten all about this...

1007
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,316
...and you<i>'</i>ll treat me
like a jerk again.

1008
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:01,799
I am a jerk.

1009
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,752
No, you<i>'</i>re not.

1010
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:08,432
It doesn<i>'</i>t make any difference.
I<i>'</i>ve killed myself so many times...

1011
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,318
...I don<i>'</i>t even exist anymore.

1012
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:13,519
Sometimes I wish I had
a thousand lifetimes.

1013
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:16,958
I don<i>'</i>t know.
Maybe it<i>'</i>s not a curse.

1014
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:19,714
It just depends
on how you look at it.

1015
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,316
Gosh, you<i>'</i>re an upbeat lady!

1016
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:29,517
I want you to know it<i>'</i>s been
a really nice day for me.

1017
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:30,590
Me too.

1018
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:31,949
And maybe...

1019
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:35,715
...if it<i>'</i>s not too boring,
we can do it again sometime.

1020
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,313
I hope so.

1021
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,718
You<i>'</i>re still here?

1022
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,719
I thought you were supposed
to disappear. Or I was.

1023
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:57,552
Not until 6.

1024
01:08:58,400 --> 01:08:59,753
You rat!

1025
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,752
I never said midnight.

1026
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,435
You knew I was waiting for midnight.

1027
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,553
Are you going to leave?

1028
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,269
Good.

1029
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:23,112
I<i>'</i>m sorry.

1030
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,710
It<i>'</i>s all right.
You can fall asleep.

1031
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:29,910
I promise I won<i>'</i>t touch you.

1032
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:31,794
Much.

1033
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:35,719
It<i>'</i>s all right. I<i>'</i>m not tired.

1034
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:38,112
What were you saying?

1035
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:42,631
I think the last thing
that you heard was...

1036
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,440
...only God could make a tree.

1037
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:46,715
Really?

1038
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:25,515
What I wanted to say was...

1039
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:29,236
...I think you are the kindest...

1040
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:31,914
...sweetest, prettiest person...

1041
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,311
...I<i>'</i>ve ever met in my life.

1042
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,916
I<i>'</i>ve never seen anyone...

1043
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,909
...that<i>'</i>s nicer to people
than you are.

1044
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,316
And the first time I saw you...

1045
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:58,510
...something happened to me.

1046
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:01,756
I never told you...

1047
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,309
...but I knew I wanted
to hold you...

1048
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,317
...as hard as I could.

1049
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:24,115
I don<i>'</i>t deserve someone like you.

1050
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:29,518
But if I ever could...

1051
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,911
...I swear I would love you...

1052
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:35,316
...for the rest of my life.

1053
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:41,517
Did you say something?

1054
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,513
Good night, Rita.

1055
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:51,193
Good night, Phil.

1056
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:18,317
<i>Campers, rise and shine!</i>
<i>Don't forget your booties,</i>

1057
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:21,432
<i>- It's cold out there!</i>
<i>- It's cold every day,</i>

1058
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:23,835
<i>- Is this Miami Beach?</i>
<i>- Not hardly!</i>

1059
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:00,155
Who wants coffee?
Get it while it<i>'</i>s hot.

1060
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,115
Thanks, Phil.

1061
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:03,116
Larry?

1062
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,351
Skim milk, two sugar.

1063
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:06,874
Thanks, Phil.

1064
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:08,195
Pastry?

1065
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:09,555
We<i>'</i>re setting up.

1066
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,478
Pastry, Larry?
Take your pick.

1067
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:14,636
Thanks. Raspberry. Great.

1068
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:18,157
I talked with Buster Green,
the head groundhog honcho.

1069
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:21,073
He said if we set up here
we<i>'</i>ll get a better shot.

1070
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,670
- What do you think?
- Sounds good.

1071
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,149
Larry?

1072
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,231
Yeah. Let<i>'</i>s go for it.

1073
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:29,469
Good work, Phil.

1074
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:33,317
Maybe we<i>'</i>ll get lucky.
Let me give you a hand.

1075
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:37,518
No, no. You got your coffee.
I<i>'</i>ll get it.

1076
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:40,557
We never talk.
Do you have kids?

1077
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:15,672
I<i>'</i>d like a piano lesson.

1078
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,788
I<i>'</i>m with a student. But if you
want to come back tomorrow...

1079
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,117
I kind of want to get started.
I can give you $1,000.

1080
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:26,636
Come on in.

1081
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:47,356
Morning!
Off to see the groundhog?

1082
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:49,516
<i>Buon giorno, signore!</i>

1083
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,835
Think it<i>'</i>ll be an early spring?

1084
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:55,355
<i>"</i>Winter, slumbering in the open air

1085
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,158
Wears on his smiling face...

1086
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:59,516
...a dream of spring<i>"</i>

1087
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:00,749
Ciao!

1088
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,149
Ciao!

1089
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:40,914
How does she look?

1090
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:42,235
Great.

1091
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:43,596
Thank you.

1092
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:47,110
Did you know he could ice sculpt?

1093
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:03,672
Not bad. You say
this is your first lesson?

1094
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:07,717
Yes, but my father
was a piano mover, so...

1095
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:17,712
- Phil Connors, I thought it was you.
- Ned Ryerson.

1096
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:21,794
I have missed you so much.

1097
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,390
I don<i>'</i>t know where you<i>'</i>re headed,
but can you call in sick?

1098
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:34,511
I got to get going.

1099
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:37,316
It<i>'</i>s good to see you, Phil.

1100
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:56,079
Hello, father.

1101
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,438
Let<i>'</i>s get you someplace warm.

1102
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:01,519
Remember me?

1103
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:09,718
You brought the old man in?

1104
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:10,909
How is he?

1105
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,511
He just passed away.

1106
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:18,112
- What did he die of?
- He was just old.

1107
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:20,112
It was just his time.

1108
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:25,638
- I want to see his chart. Excuse me.
- Sir!

1109
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,558
You can<i>'</i>t come in here.

1110
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:30,314
Sir, this is a restricted area.

1111
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:40,712
Where<i>'</i>s the chart?

1112
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:43,430
Sometimes people just die.

1113
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:45,719
Not today.

1114
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,716
Gets hard down there at the bottom.

1115
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:03,669
Here you go.

1116
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,069
Thank you.

1117
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:10,355
Come on, dad.

1118
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:11,919
Come on, pop.

1119
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:15,518
Come on. Come on, breathe.

1120
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:18,320
Breathe, pop! Breathe, pop!

1121
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,560
When Chekhov saw the long winter...

1122
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,231
...he saw a winter bleak
and dark and bereft of hope.

1123
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:53,951
Yet we know winter is just
another step in the cycle of life.

1124
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:57,715
But standing here among
the people of Punxsutawney...

1125
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:00,633
...and basking in the warmth
of their hearths and hearts...

1126
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:03,875
...I couldn<i>'</i>t imagine a better fate...

1127
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:06,913
...than a long and lustrous winter.

1128
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:09,833
From Punxsutawney, it<i>'</i>s Phil Connors.

1129
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:11,308
So long.

1130
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:14,758
Nice speech. Very nice.

1131
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,115
Thank you.

1132
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:20,517
- How was that for you two?
- My man, you touched me.

1133
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:22,352
- Thanks, Larry.
- Thank you.

1134
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:24,556
I got to go.

1135
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:29,959
That was surprising.
I didn<i>'</i>t know you were so versatile.

1136
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:31,792
I surprise myself sometimes.

1137
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,911
Would you like a cup of coffee?

1138
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:37,908
I<i>'</i>d love to. Can I have a rain check?
I<i>'</i>ve got some errands.

1139
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,351
Errands? What errands?

1140
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,716
I thought we were going back.

1141
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:05,359
What do you say?
What do you say?

1142
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:08,313
You little brat.
You have never thanked me!

1143
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,558
I<i>'</i>ll see you tomorrow...

1144
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:11,835
...maybe.

1145
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:21,470
You totaled it.

1146
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:25,639
- It<i>'</i>s only a flat tire.
- What are we going to do?

1147
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:30,236
- It<i>'</i>s an earthquake!
- It<i>'</i>s not an earthquake.

1148
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:31,395
What is it?

1149
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:36,831
Thank you, young man.

1150
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:40,195
It<i>'</i>s nothing.
I had the tire and the jack.

1151
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:42,954
Just be comfortable.
It<i>'</i>ll be a minute.

1152
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:44,349
Who is that?

1153
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:47,239
He must be from the motor club.

1154
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:51,000
He<i>'</i>s having a heart attack!
Do something!

1155
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:55,153
Call 411, an ambulance, a lawyer,
doctor, anything!

1156
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:03,599
I think that did it.

1157
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:10,073
If you<i>'</i>re going to eat steak,
get sharper teeth.

1158
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,550
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

1159
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:14,394
Who was that?

1160
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:17,194
- I<i>'</i>m fine, I<i>'</i>m fine.
- Are you sure?

1161
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:18,270
Eat, eat!

1162
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:23,999
<i>People don't understand,,,</i>

1163
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:26,873
...what<i>'</i>s involved.
This is an art form.

1164
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:29,475
I think most people just think...

1165
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:32,757
...that I hold a camera
and point it at stuff.

1166
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,195
There<i>'</i>s a lot more to it than that.

1167
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:40,516
Would you be interested in seeing
the inside of a van?

1168
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:43,871
You know, I really have to
get back to the party.

1169
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:45,758
Great idea.
I<i>'</i>ll go with you.

1170
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,150
Let me just drop a tip here.

1171
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:55,393
Hi! How are you?

1172
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:57,358
Rita, this is Nancy.

1173
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:00,590
We were going to the party.
You going?

1174
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:03,314
Sounds like fun.
Maybe we should call Phil.

1175
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:06,351
I think he<i>'</i>s already in there.

1176
01:23:58,280 --> 01:23:59,474
Isn<i>'</i>t he good?

1177
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:00,789
He<i>'</i>s great!

1178
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:02,598
He<i>'</i>s my student.

1179
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:06,917
I<i>'</i>m so proud.

1180
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:09,189
Thank you.

1181
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:12,276
Hello, welcome to our party.

1182
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:14,670
I didn<i>'</i>t know you could
play like that.

1183
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:16,558
I<i>'</i>m versatile.

1184
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:26,552
It<i>'</i>s that nice young man
from the motor club.

1185
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:28,193
Thank you again.

1186
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:29,793
It<i>'</i>s nothing, ladies.

1187
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:33,157
He<i>'</i>s the fastest jack
in Jefferson County.

1188
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:37,078
What was that all about?

1189
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:40,278
Don<i>'</i>t know. They<i>'</i>ve been
hitting on me all night.

1190
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:42,439
There you are!

1191
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:47,392
I never thanked you properly
for what you did.

1192
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:49,596
He would<i>'</i>ve choked for sure.

1193
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:53,389
He may have. He was trying
to swallow a whole cow.

1194
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:54,789
I owe you one, buddy.

1195
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:58,032
Hang on to him, dear.
He<i>'</i>s a real find.

1196
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:01,998
What did you do today?

1197
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:03,753
Same old, same old.

1198
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:10,759
Excuse me, Mr. Connors.

1199
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:12,473
Fred, how was the wedding?

1200
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:15,598
Thank you for making
Debbie go through with it.

1201
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:18,752
All I did was fan her flame
of passion for you.

1202

You are the best.

1203
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:21,389
No, you are.

1204
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:24,677
Rita, this is
Debbie and Fred Kleiser.

1205
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:28,595
- Here you go, kids. Congratulations.
- What is this?

1206
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:30,792
No way!

1207
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:34,032
WrestleMania!
No way!

1208
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:37,793
How<i>'</i>d you know?
We<i>'</i>ll be in Pittsburgh anyway!

Thank you. You<i>'</i>re a real pal.

1210
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:41,837
Oh, this is the best.

1211
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:47,793
I don<i>'</i>t understand.

1212
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:49,678
I guess not.

1213
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:52,799
How does everyone know you?
You come once a year.

1214
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:54,792
You<i>'</i>re the most popular
person in town.

1215
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:57,156
Excuse me, Dr. Connors?

1216
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:00,158
I want to thank you
for fixing Felix<i>'</i>s back.

1217
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:02,351
He can help around the house again.

1218
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:04,949
Well, I<i>'</i>m sorry
to hear that, Felix.

1219
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:08,798
Dr. Connors?

1220
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:11,390
It<i>'</i>s kind of an honorary title.

1221
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:13,153
What is going on?

1222
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:14,349
I really don<i>'</i>t know.

1223
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:16,955
There is something
going on with you.

1224
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:19,397
You want the long or short version?

1225
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:22,359
Let<i>'</i>s start with the short
and go from there.

1226
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:29,831
Okay, folks, attention.

1265
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:36,394
Phil Connors,
I thought that was you.

1266
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:38,995
This is Ned Ryerson,
my new insurance agent.

1267
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:40,434
I<i>'</i>ll say.

1268
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,477
I haven<i>'</i>t seen him for 20 years.

1269
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:48,555
He comes up and buys whole life,
term, fire, auto, dental, health...

1270
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:51,558
...with the optional death
and dismemberment plan.

1271
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:53,870
This is the best day of my life.

1272
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:56,156
- Mine too.
- Mine too.

1273
01:28:56,360 --> 01:28:57,554
Where are we going?

1274
01:28:57,800 --> 01:28:59,438
Let<i>'</i>s not spoil it.

1275
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:03,434
Let<i>'</i>s not...
I got that.

1276
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:07,593
Why can<i>'</i>t I look?

1277
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:09,792
Because you bother me a lot.

1278
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:11,399
I<i>'</i>m getting cold.

1279
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:13,158
How long do I have to sit here?

1280
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:16,752
I<i>'</i>m giving you your money<i>'</i>s worth.
You paid top dollar for me.

1281
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:19,550
Well, I think you were a bargain.

1282
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:22,396
Sweet of you to say.
You<i>'</i>re right.

1283
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:26,393
Is it finished yet?

1284
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:29,993
I still have to put
cherry syrup on the top...

1285
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:31,189
...then we can eat it.

1286
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:34,000
Come on, Phil.
I<i>'</i>m freezing!

1287
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:35,792
One second, one second.

1288
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:37,758
Let me turn it in the light.

1289
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:44,473
It<i>'</i>s amazing.

1290
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:46,394
It<i>'</i>s beautiful.

1291
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:51,839
How did you do that?

1292
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:56,269
I know your face so well,
I could<i>'</i>ve done it with my eyes closed.

1293
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:01,993
It<i>'</i>s lovely.

1294
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:04,472
I don<i>'</i>t know what to say.

1295
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:06,789
I do.

1296
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:10,995
No matter what happens tomorrow...

1297
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:13,037
...or for the rest of my life...

1298
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:14,878
...I<i>'</i>m happy now...

1299
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:17,553
...because I love you.

1300
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:20,158
I think I<i>'</i>m happy too.

1301
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:17,555
<i>Please, Not again,</i>

1302
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,557
<i>- That's a great song,</i>
<i>- It's not,</i>

1303
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:21,756
<i>Don't listen to this man...</i>

1304
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:24,629
It<i>'</i>s too early.

1305
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:36,638
Something is different.

1306
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:38,434
Good or bad?

1307
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,995
Anything different is good.

1308
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:45,555
But this could be real good.

1309
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:51,593
Why are you here?

1310
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:54,031
I bought you.
I own you.

1311
01:31:56,440 --> 01:31:57,953
But why are you still here?

1312
01:31:58,200 --> 01:32:01,158
You said, <i>"</i>Stay,<i>"</i>
so I stayed.

1313
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:05,676
I said, <i>"</i>Stay,<i>"</i>
so you stayed.

1314
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:08,354
I can<i>'</i>t even make a collie stay.

1315
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:12,351
I got to check something.

1316
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:14,439
Stay.

1317
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:15,909
Stay.

1318
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:22,548
They<i>'</i>re gone!

1319
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:24,953
They<i>'</i>re all gone.

1320
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:29,554
- Do you know what today is?
- No, what?

1321
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:32,751
Today is tomorrow.

1322
01:32:33,320 --> 01:32:34,594
It happened.

1323
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:38,910
- You<i>'</i>re here.
- I<i>'</i>m here.

1324
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:47,357
Why weren<i>'</i>t you like this last night?
You just fell asleep.

1325
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:51,793
It was the end of a very long day.

1326
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:58,389
Is there anything I can do
for you today?

1327
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:01,754
I<i>'</i>m sure I can think of something.

1328
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:35,431
It<i>'</i>s so beautiful!

1329
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:47,198
Let<i>'</i>s live here.

1330
01:33:57,240 --> 01:33:59,196
We<i>'</i>ll rent to start.
