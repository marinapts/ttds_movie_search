1
00:00:03,572 --> 00:00:07,446
Come to me

2
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,545
Come lie beside me

3
00:00:10,631 --> 00:00:15,377
And don't deny me your love

4
00:00:18,725 --> 00:00:22,282
Make sense of me

5
00:00:23,597 --> 00:00:25,626
Walk through my doorway

6
00:00:25,707 --> 00:00:29,504
Don't hide in the hallway
oh, love

7
00:00:33,072 --> 00:00:36,062
Step over

8
00:00:42,202 --> 00:00:45,454
I'll followyou down

9
00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:10,702
In the name of whisky

10
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:13,119
In the name of song

11
00:01:13,812 --> 00:01:15,536
You didn't look back

12
00:01:16,383 --> 00:01:18,259
You didn't belong

13
00:01:18,915 --> 00:01:20,824
In the name of reason

14
00:01:21,446 --> 00:01:23,356
In the name ofhope

15
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:25,926
In the name of religion

16
00:01:26,357 --> 00:01:28,266
In the name of dope

17
00:01:29,004 --> 00:01:30,530
In the name of freedom

18
00:01:31,574 --> 00:01:33,636
You drifted away

19
00:01:33,722 --> 00:01:36,362
To see the sun shining

20
00:01:36,446 --> 00:01:38,585
On someone else's day

21
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,900
In the name of United

22
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,355
And the BBC

23
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,848
In the name of Georgie Best

24
00:01:56,662 --> 00:01:58,386
And LSD

25
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:01,408
In the name ofthe Father

26
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,449
And His wife, the Spirit

27
00:02:03,913 --> 00:02:05,865
You said you did not

28
00:02:06,445 --> 00:02:08,397
They said you did

29
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,809
In the name ofjustice

30
00:02:11,355 --> 00:02:13,264
In the name of fun

31
00:02:13,964 --> 00:02:15,873
In the name ofthe Father

32
00:02:16,419 --> 00:02:18,328
In the name ofthe Son

33
00:02:28,886 --> 00:02:32,443
Call to me

34
00:02:33,681 --> 00:02:35,743
No one is listening

35
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:40,499
I'm waiting to hear from you, love

36
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,241
Hello, hello.

37
00:02:53,323 --> 00:02:57,305
Good. I never said "thank you"'
for taking up our case.

38
00:02:57,389 --> 00:02:59,494
Never thought I'd trust
an English person again...

39
00:02:59,576 --> 00:03:01,528
especially a lawyer.

40
00:03:01,609 --> 00:03:05,787
Anyhow, I'll be as accurate as I can
with names, dates and places...

41
00:03:05,867 --> 00:03:08,474
anything that might help
in our defence.

42
00:03:08,552 --> 00:03:11,116
To explain howl happened
to be in England in 1974...

43
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,650
at the time ofthe bombing...

44
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,832
I'd better take you back
to Northern Ireland, where I come from.

45
00:03:15,918 --> 00:03:19,518
Belfast in the early '70s was chaos.

46
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,356
It was strange to see
soldiers on the street...

47
00:03:21,442 --> 00:03:24,311
all ofthem terrified
ofthe civilian population...

48
00:03:24,396 --> 00:03:26,381
any one of whom could be
an IRA gunman.

49
00:03:27,848 --> 00:03:29,604
I wasjust a petty thief...

50
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:31,642
stealing scrap metal.

51
00:03:31,723 --> 00:03:34,089
In Belfast, that was
a dangerous occupation.

52
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:38,010
Get down, Gerry,
for fuck's sake.

53
00:03:38,091 --> 00:03:39,193
Tommo!

54
00:03:40,622 --> 00:03:42,728
The IRA had already
given me three warnings...

55
00:03:42,809 --> 00:03:46,137
and when a British patrol mistook me for
a gunman, that got me into real trouble.

56
00:03:46,223 --> 00:03:48,023
Is he trying to fucking shoot us?

57
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,647
There's a sniper! He's up there!

58
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:02,482
I can't get a bead on him.

59
00:04:02,565 --> 00:04:04,747
Shoot him
before he fucking kills us!

60
00:04:19,982 --> 00:04:21,629
Fucking bastards!

61
00:04:29,457 --> 00:04:32,174
All right, hurry up
and tell Mr Kelly, love.

62
00:04:34,329 --> 00:04:36,740
Two suspects proceeding
back west...

63
00:04:37,474 --> 00:04:38,696
Mr Kelly!

64
00:04:39,661 --> 00:04:41,112
Bastards!

65
00:04:41,196 --> 00:04:43,956
We have to move the guns.
You go and move the gear.

66
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,019
Right. Everyone out now!
Come on!

67
00:04:47,065 --> 00:04:49,628
Get out ofthe fucking way.
The Brits is after us!

68
00:04:52,013 --> 00:04:54,926
The Brits is after us!
The Brits are after us!

69
00:04:55,006 --> 00:04:57,843
- In here, in here!
- Gerry!

70
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,865
Come on, come on.
This way, lads.

71
00:05:02,755 --> 00:05:04,402
Go! Go! Go, go!

72
00:05:20,401 --> 00:05:21,623
Go on, Gerry!

73
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:28,453
Looks like they're
coming out of everywhere.

74
00:05:29,838 --> 00:05:31,977
They're right in front of us, boys.

75
00:05:35,822 --> 00:05:37,470
- Who is it?
- It's Conlon.

76
00:05:37,549 --> 00:05:38,574
Grab him!

77
00:05:56,193 --> 00:05:58,800
It's your brother!
Your brother Gerry!

78
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:01,859
Oh, my God!

79
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:20,238
Fucking English bastards!

80
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:25,758
They've started a riot
to cover the sniper.

81
00:06:25,846 --> 00:06:27,569
If we can isolate him,
we can grab him.

82
00:06:27,649 --> 00:06:28,871
Let's go, lads.

83
00:06:31,063 --> 00:06:33,048
Let's go, let's go!
Move it!

84
00:06:36,971 --> 00:06:39,688
Get that child out ofhere now!

85
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,676
Move that child!

86
00:06:50,781 --> 00:06:53,192
Shoot that fucking gas now!

87
00:07:01,331 --> 00:07:03,697
Come and fucking get us now,
you bastards!

88
00:07:11,343 --> 00:07:13,557
Let him go, you bastards!

89
00:07:13,645 --> 00:07:15,445
Fucking bitch!

90
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:30,861
You okay?

91
00:07:30,946 --> 00:07:32,855
- I got a friend wants to talk to you.
- Oh, fuck's sake.

92
00:07:32,941 --> 00:07:35,624
Hey, come on. We can do this
the easy way or the hard way, all right?

93
00:07:35,703 --> 00:07:37,612
Let's be smart.
Come on.

94
00:07:39,846 --> 00:07:41,111
They're taking
your brother away!

95
00:07:43,452 --> 00:07:44,946
Where are you going now?

96
00:07:45,024 --> 00:07:46,748
- We weren't robbing no houses.
- Don't fuck with me.

97
00:07:46,827 --> 00:07:48,398
Suddenly you're a good boy?

98
00:07:48,477 --> 00:07:50,811
- Have you been robbing houses again?
- We weren't robbing houses.

99
00:07:50,894 --> 00:07:53,108
Search him.
Did you get away all right?

100
00:07:53,196 --> 00:07:54,952
- Aye.
- Who was it?

101
00:07:55,037 --> 00:07:56,608
- It was those two.
- Those two?

102
00:07:56,686 --> 00:07:59,828
- That isn't mine. It isn't.
- Peter?

103
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:02,472
Shoot the bastards!
They're always robbing our houses!

104
00:08:02,556 --> 00:08:03,658
Fuck you!

105
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,884
Daddy, Daddy,
the IRA has our Gerry.

106
00:08:10,727 --> 00:08:12,560
Go on, showme.

107
00:08:12,645 --> 00:08:14,936
Yo, give him that.

108
00:08:15,023 --> 00:08:17,085
Right, Tommo, lad.

109
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:29,598
Tommo, get their trousers down.
I fucking warned you, Danny.

110
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:31,707
- Peter, we didn't do nothing, honestly.
- Give you a break?

111
00:08:31,787 --> 00:08:34,002
What's she saying?
What are we supposed to have done?

112
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:36,151
This is what I'm gonna give you.
Nowget your trousers down.

113
00:08:36,237 --> 00:08:38,528
You just ran into the house
where we had all that gear.

114
00:08:38,616 --> 00:08:41,071
What was I supposed to know?
I was trying to get away from the Brits.

115
00:08:41,148 --> 00:08:42,828
'Cause you were
stealing lead again, weren't you?

116
00:08:42,912 --> 00:08:44,286
You were stealing lead.

117
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,475
- Shut up, Danny!
- They were shooting at us.

118
00:08:46,557 --> 00:08:48,237
- Get the strides down now.
- Why?

119
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:51,005
'Cause you'll get cloth in the wound
and lose your leg, that's why.

120
00:08:52,042 --> 00:08:54,072
Come on, Peter. Give us a few slaps.
You don't have to shoot us.

121
00:08:54,152 --> 00:08:55,908
- Fuck's sake.
- Fucking Tarzan.

122
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:57,641
Look at the balls on him!

123
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:02,543
Jesus! Christ!
Peter! Peter!

124
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,041
They're only young.
Give 'em a chance.

125
00:09:05,124 --> 00:09:07,535
We werejust trying
to scare some sense into them.

126
00:09:07,617 --> 00:09:09,340
He was stealing lead again.

127
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,449
He ran through one of our houses
and started all this shit.

128
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,101
Did you start all this?

129
00:09:14,944 --> 00:09:17,781
He'll never survive
in this town. Never.

130
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,660
This is the last time.
You two blow!

131
00:09:19,739 --> 00:09:21,266
And, Danny, it's the last time.

132
00:09:21,351 --> 00:09:22,998
- The same for you, Conlon.
- Pull up your trousers.

133
00:09:23,077 --> 00:09:24,648
Come back here!

134
00:09:26,069 --> 00:09:29,211
- We've never had a thiefin our family.
- We've never had nothing in our family.

135
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:32,543
- Will you get ajob?
- You knowwe can't getjobs.

136
00:09:33,933 --> 00:09:35,657
I have ajob.

137
00:09:35,736 --> 00:09:37,765
Do you want me to work
as a bookie's clerk?

138
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:41,949
- I want you to have some respect.
- Aye, respect for who?

139
00:09:43,102 --> 00:09:44,476
For yourself.

140
00:09:53,229 --> 00:09:55,520
We're getting you out ofhere.

141
00:09:58,408 --> 00:10:00,317
He'll do no growing up
in England, Giuseppe.

142
00:10:00,403 --> 00:10:02,661
No family life there.

143
00:10:02,743 --> 00:10:04,925
Oh, give over, Ma.

144
00:10:05,006 --> 00:10:07,614
I'm gonna miss the boat.
What's that?

145
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:10,147
- Sausages for your Aunt Annie.
- Jesus Christ, Ma!

146
00:10:10,223 --> 00:10:11,947
- Here you are, son.
- Here, let me do that.

147
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:18,461
All right, I'm ready.
Where are you going?

148
00:10:18,548 --> 00:10:19,650
I'll walk with you.

149
00:10:19,737 --> 00:10:21,308
Do you not trust me
to get on the boat?

150
00:10:22,614 --> 00:10:25,025
I'm sure I'll be back
when I'm a millionaire, Gran.

151
00:10:25,108 --> 00:10:26,940
Good luck. God bless.

152
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,706
I love you, son.

153
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,972
- Cheerio, Gerry.
- Behave yourself, Ann.

154
00:10:31,054 --> 00:10:32,395
Cheerio, Gerry.

155
00:10:32,473 --> 00:10:33,695
Bye, Bridie.

156
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,075
He's gone nowforever.

157
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,615
I'll be surprised ifhe lasts a month.

158
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:54,867
Did I ever tell you
the time I jumped ship?

159
00:10:56,027 --> 00:10:58,209
Jumped overboard
about 200 yards out to sea...

160
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,352
swam back to this
godforsaken place.

161
00:11:05,004 --> 00:11:07,186
Why did you swim back?

162
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:09,100
There was a woman involved.

163
00:11:10,643 --> 00:11:12,017
Oh, aye?

164
00:11:13,405 --> 00:11:16,318
It was when I was healthy,
before you were born.

165
00:11:26,409 --> 00:11:28,242
What was her name?

166
00:11:28,328 --> 00:11:30,694
Aye, you knowher name.
You knowyour own mother's name.

167
00:11:30,783 --> 00:11:34,383
Sarah.
Sarah Maguire she was.

168
00:11:34,465 --> 00:11:37,149
Then she had the misfortune
to change it to Conlon.

169
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,339
Boarding all passengers.

170
00:11:49,426 --> 00:11:52,110
All second-class passengers
boarding now.

171
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,531
Go and live.
Go and live, son.

172
00:12:06,612 --> 00:12:08,413
That's the best advice
I can give you.

173
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:17,925
Remember,
honest money goes further.

174
00:12:18,927 --> 00:12:20,574
Honest money goes further.

175
00:12:20,653 --> 00:12:22,256
A bird in the hand is worth
two in the bush.

176
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:24,555
Never look a gift horse
in the mouth.

177
00:12:24,642 --> 00:12:27,053
He'd a cliche
for every occasion.

178
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:31,124
I'll give you a call.

179
00:12:31,202 --> 00:12:32,729
Right, son.

180
00:12:34,655 --> 00:12:37,567
I ran up the gangplank
to get away from him...

181
00:12:37,647 --> 00:12:39,786
and then I suddenly
felt bad about it.

182
00:12:39,872 --> 00:12:41,628
I decided to turn back...

183
00:12:41,713 --> 00:12:45,117
to call him Giuseppe
for the first time in my life.

184
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,416
When I turned around,
he had already walked away.

185
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,291
- I just called after him.
- Good-bye, Da!

186
00:12:56,828 --> 00:13:00,854
Then I met my old schoolmate,
Paul Hill.

187
00:13:00,933 --> 00:13:04,533
Little did I knowthat after meeting him
my life would change forever.

188
00:13:10,216 --> 00:13:11,820
You're under arrest.

189
00:13:14,551 --> 00:13:16,504
Fuck's sake, Gerry!

190
00:13:16,584 --> 00:13:19,759
- Still a head case.
- James Bond, license to kill.

191
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:23,289
Look at you... you're a fucking nervous
wreck. What's the matter with you?

192
00:13:23,374 --> 00:13:24,945
I'm glad to get outta Belfast.

193
00:13:30,318 --> 00:13:32,118
Where're you going?

194
00:13:32,197 --> 00:13:34,881
- I'm going to London. What about you?
- The same.

195
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,912
I need a drink.

196
00:13:36,993 --> 00:13:40,288
Aye, I'm skint.
I'll let you buy me one.

197
00:13:51,608 --> 00:13:54,325
Once upon a time
you dressed so fine

198
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:56,940
You threwthe bums a dime
in your prime

199
00:13:57,976 --> 00:13:59,503
Didn't you

200
00:14:01,314 --> 00:14:04,151
I arrived in London
on the 26th ofJune.

201
00:14:04,229 --> 00:14:06,717
My mother had given me
the address of my Aunt Annie...

202
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,746
but I had an invitation to a hippie
commune from my old friend...

203
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,892
Paddy Armstrong.

204
00:14:11,978 --> 00:14:14,193
Jesus, Gerry, we've been
walking around for hours.

205
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,539
- It's only that big on the map.
- But it's a map, Gerry.

206
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,496
London's a big place, you know.

207
00:14:21,645 --> 00:14:26,053
What I was really looking for
was free love and dope.

208
00:14:27,898 --> 00:14:29,884
I think it's this way.

209
00:14:44,432 --> 00:14:46,417
Paddy?

210
00:14:47,194 --> 00:14:49,529
- Yeah, what is it?
- We're looking for Paddy.

211
00:14:49,611 --> 00:14:51,902
- Paddy who?
- Paddy from Belfast. Paddy Armstrong.

212
00:14:54,483 --> 00:14:58,509
- There's some people here to see you!
- Who is it?

213
00:14:58,588 --> 00:14:59,853
Some Irish boys.

214
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,916
Jesus! Gerry Conlon.

215
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:03,496
What about you, Paddy?

216
00:15:03,575 --> 00:15:05,375
Thought you was the drug squad.
Come on in.

217
00:15:10,979 --> 00:15:12,200
There you go.

218
00:15:16,042 --> 00:15:17,766
Welcome to Xanadu.

219
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,602
Hi.

220
00:15:22,794 --> 00:15:24,703
Jesus fucking wept.

221
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:26,851
Neat, ain't it?

222
00:15:26,937 --> 00:15:28,540
Deptford Jim.

223
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,883
- Paul Hill. Gerry Conlon from home.
- Right.

224
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:35,675
Before you can enter the circle...

225
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,317
you have to have
the rite of passage.

226
00:15:39,404 --> 00:15:41,128
Open your mouth.

227
00:15:53,215 --> 00:15:55,167
I enjoyed that.

228
00:15:55,862 --> 00:15:57,356
They can't stay.

229
00:15:57,434 --> 00:15:59,267
- There's not enough room.
- Jim!

230
00:15:59,353 --> 00:16:03,990
Our rule:
No property. No law.

231
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:05,947
- Just love.
- All right, let's vote on it.

232
00:16:06,027 --> 00:16:07,249
If you want Gerry and...

233
00:16:07,332 --> 00:16:09,132
- What's your name?
- Paul.

234
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:14,117
We're gonna call you
"Saddest Moon."

235
00:16:16,193 --> 00:16:18,255
- Fuck off.
- Right?

236
00:16:18,342 --> 00:16:20,872
If you want Gerry and Saddest Moon
to stay, raise your hands.

237
00:16:21,909 --> 00:16:23,862
Four, five, six...

238
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:26,201
- Put your hand up, Paddy.
- Right.

239
00:16:26,282 --> 00:16:28,617
- Eight.
- Looks like we're staying then.

240
00:16:35,451 --> 00:16:36,825
What shall we call you then?

241
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,777
You can call me "Wild One."

242
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,271
Here, hold on. Come here.

243
00:16:43,353 --> 00:16:44,957
Get off, all right?

244
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,951
What's the fucking problem?

245
00:16:48,494 --> 00:16:50,370
They have dead pig in here.

246
00:16:51,217 --> 00:16:52,636
Just some sausages.

247
00:16:52,714 --> 00:16:54,776
We're all vegetarians here.

248
00:16:54,862 --> 00:16:56,924
I am a vegetarian.
We're both vegetarians.

249
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:59,344
I wasjust taking them sausages
to me Auntie Annie's.

250
00:16:59,427 --> 00:17:02,831
I have to be around there now. I'll be
back in a fewminutes, all right?

251
00:17:03,877 --> 00:17:05,371
Be back in a fewminutes.

252
00:17:07,138 --> 00:17:08,315
Piggy.

253
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:09,930
And Porky.

254
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:17,720
Is she related to the
Royal Family or something?

255
00:17:17,802 --> 00:17:19,635
Aye, she's fifth in line
to the throne.

256
00:17:22,252 --> 00:17:25,547
Ferguson's sausages... only good thing
that came out ofthat godforsaken place.

257
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,155
- Would you like some more?
- No, I'm fine, thanks.

258
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:30,228
- We better make tracks.
- Won't you stay? I've the bed made up.

259
00:17:30,308 --> 00:17:32,642
You're very kind, but we need
a bit of space, Auntie Annie.

260
00:17:32,725 --> 00:17:34,558
We're forming a band
and that there.

261
00:17:34,643 --> 00:17:36,748
Aye. A rock band.

262
00:17:39,246 --> 00:17:40,424
Where are you staying?

263
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:43,925
- The address, you mean?
- Uh-huh.

264
00:17:45,768 --> 00:17:47,982
- Fillmore.
- Fillimore.

265
00:17:48,069 --> 00:17:51,321
Fillimore Road.
It's number 60...

266
00:17:51,407 --> 00:17:54,581
something...
the number dropped offthe door.

267
00:17:57,161 --> 00:17:58,961
What do you mean,
the number dropped offthe door?

268
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:03,063
Well, would you let me have it
when you find out what it is?

269
00:18:03,146 --> 00:18:05,863
- Aye.
- And would you phone your mother?

270
00:18:05,946 --> 00:18:08,477
Aye.
There's only one problem.

271
00:18:10,895 --> 00:18:12,575
It doesn't have a phone.

272
00:18:17,608 --> 00:18:20,597
Hello, Marian. Any problems?

273
00:18:20,677 --> 00:18:22,400
- Is it all there?
- Yeah.

274
00:18:23,285 --> 00:18:25,347
Okay.
We're in business.

275
00:18:25,434 --> 00:18:27,997
Watch the cracks.
Watch the cracks.

276
00:18:28,081 --> 00:18:30,721
It's not fair.
Their skirts are covering the cracks.

277
00:18:30,804 --> 00:18:32,408
He's cheating!

278
00:18:32,492 --> 00:18:33,670
- I'm a referee!
- He's cheating.

279
00:19:19,677 --> 00:19:21,630
- That wasn't too far away, was it?
- Is that a bomb, Paddy?

280
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,620
It's getting more like home.

281
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:27,343
Hello? Hold on, hold on.

282
00:19:27,426 --> 00:19:29,685
Giuseppe. Giuseppe.
Long-distance call.

283
00:19:29,766 --> 00:19:31,599
- What?
- Long-distance call.

284
00:19:34,485 --> 00:19:35,750
- Go ahead.
- Hello?

285
00:19:35,827 --> 00:19:37,627
- Ask him for the money.
- Hey, Da.

286
00:19:37,707 --> 00:19:39,278
- It's Gerry speaking.
- Son.

287
00:19:39,357 --> 00:19:41,266
- Hi. Howare you doing?
- I'm fine. Howare you?

288
00:19:41,351 --> 00:19:43,381
It's been six weeks
since you've been in touch.

289
00:19:43,461 --> 00:19:45,414
I know. Sorry about that.
I've been a bit busy.

290
00:19:45,494 --> 00:19:48,713
It'sjust your ma's a bit worried,
you know. You still going to Mass?

291
00:19:48,794 --> 00:19:51,663
- Aye, every Sunday. Like clockwork.
- Good.

292
00:19:51,747 --> 00:19:55,272
- Are you working?
- I have a couple ofthings going here.

293
00:19:55,353 --> 00:19:56,880
Ah, good.
And are you safe?

294
00:19:56,965 --> 00:19:59,681
- How do you mean?
- From all the bombs.

295
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:02,405
Aye, you could just hear them
in the distance like, but...

296
00:20:03,755 --> 00:20:05,129
Sorry about that.

297
00:20:05,212 --> 00:20:07,394
- Are you stuck?
- How do you mean, Da?

298
00:20:07,476 --> 00:20:08,894
Are you short of cash?

299
00:20:08,972 --> 00:20:11,427
Uh, no. No, I'm flush
at the moment.

300
00:20:11,504 --> 00:20:13,915
No problem.
No, I have plenty of money.

301
00:20:13,997 --> 00:20:16,179
All right.
And, Gerry, keep in touch.

302
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,435
- Aye. All right. Bye-bye, Da.
- All right, son. I'll tell your ma...

303
00:20:21,132 --> 00:20:22,659
Bye.

304
00:20:24,508 --> 00:20:26,188
Sorry about that.

305
00:20:26,273 --> 00:20:28,640
We've enough for chips.

306
00:20:31,567 --> 00:20:33,596
Sorry, we'd only
enough money for two chips.

307
00:20:33,677 --> 00:20:35,128
Are you all right?

308
00:20:35,211 --> 00:20:36,859
What?

309
00:20:36,937 --> 00:20:38,693
There's bombs everywhere.
People have been hurt.

310
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,691
There they are.
It's the Irish.

311
00:20:41,771 --> 00:20:43,527
Bringing all their troubles
over here again.

312
00:20:43,612 --> 00:20:48,053
Aye, it's all right when it happens
over in Belfast. You fucking prick!

313
00:20:48,139 --> 00:20:51,663
I've seen people killed
in front of my fucking eyes!

314
00:20:51,745 --> 00:20:55,193
- You stupid fucking prick!
- Go home! Fuck you!

315
00:20:55,274 --> 00:20:57,336
I don't fucking believe this.
I'm getting out ofhere.

316
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,637
- Are you coming, Paddy?
- Where are you gonna sleep?

317
00:20:59,724 --> 00:21:02,364
Ah, no problem. We'll sleep
in the park or something.

318
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:06,858
- I'll see you soon, sweetheart.
- Take care.

319
00:21:06,936 --> 00:21:09,544
- Mind your fucking manners!
- Prick.

320
00:21:09,621 --> 00:21:12,840
Troops have entered
the Ardoyne area ofWest Belfast...

321
00:21:12,921 --> 00:21:16,292
since the collapse ofthe provisional
IRA cease-fire over the weekend.

322
00:21:16,373 --> 00:21:18,435
Yeah, I'm watching it.

323
00:21:18,521 --> 00:21:23,006
Civilians have been evacuated, and there
are reports of casualties in many areas.

324
00:21:23,086 --> 00:21:25,770
- Both sides are blaming each other...
- Okay, I'll take care ofit.

325
00:21:27,575 --> 00:21:30,597
That's it. 8:00 tonight.

326
00:21:31,257 --> 00:21:32,632
No warning.

327
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:44,026
That's my place.
Youse are sitting there too long.

328
00:21:44,109 --> 00:21:48,593
CB... Charlie Burke.
That's me.

329
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:51,314
I carved my initials
with this penknife.

330
00:21:51,397 --> 00:21:54,768
No problem, Charlie.
No problem. Whatever you say.

331
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:57,916
Closing the park.
Park closing now.

332
00:21:57,996 --> 00:22:00,407
- Easy with the feet there, Charlie.
- It's a big bench, you know?

333
00:22:00,489 --> 00:22:02,518
There's room for three of us here.

334
00:22:03,711 --> 00:22:05,544
You're Irish too, aren't you?

335
00:22:07,663 --> 00:22:10,532
I come over here
when I was about your age.

336
00:22:10,616 --> 00:22:12,951
Did you ever think
of going home, Charlie?

337
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:15,018
Ah, shit.

338
00:22:15,105 --> 00:22:17,745
There's nothing for me
over there now.

339
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:24,769
- Closing the park!
- Could you lend us a few shillings?

340
00:22:24,849 --> 00:22:26,572
I was gonna ask you the same.

341
00:22:34,439 --> 00:22:36,621
- Gerry, we've no money left.
- It's all I have.

342
00:22:36,702 --> 00:22:39,419
Well, now, like I wouldn't like
to take all your money.

343
00:22:39,503 --> 00:22:41,412
No problem.
Catch you again, Charlie.

344
00:22:41,498 --> 00:22:44,639
- Come on. It's not even 8:00 yet.
- All right, all right.

345
00:22:55,154 --> 00:22:59,136
We must'vejust said good night
to Charlie Burke when the bomb went off.

346
00:22:59,221 --> 00:23:02,701
All we were concerned about was
where we were gonna sleep that night.

347
00:23:02,788 --> 00:23:04,698
We'd no money
in our pockets.

348
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:07,729
We hadn't even the bus fare to Guildford
even if we'd known where it was.

349
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:12,607
No fucking way I'm going
back to Belfast.

350
00:23:12,686 --> 00:23:14,212
I tell you that.

351
00:23:17,481 --> 00:23:20,121
- Hey, blondie.
- Hey, sexy.

352
00:23:20,204 --> 00:23:22,190
- You dropped something.
- Back off, paddy.

353
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:24,076
She's outta your league.

354
00:23:24,156 --> 00:23:25,378
Here.

355
00:23:32,941 --> 00:23:35,307
It's her fucking keys.
I'm going in.

356
00:23:35,396 --> 00:23:37,959
We should give 'em back, Gerry.
Put 'em through the letter box.

357
00:23:38,043 --> 00:23:40,148
Put the keys back
in the letter box, Gerry.

358
00:24:32,631 --> 00:24:34,541
Jesus Christ,
howmuch money is there?

359
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:41,101
I got 700 from
the hooker's apartment.

360
00:24:41,186 --> 00:24:43,717
I did feel a little bit
guilty about that.

361
00:24:45,022 --> 00:24:47,630
We spent that night
in a hotel.

362
00:24:47,707 --> 00:24:51,689
The next day we went and bought
the same clothes... the same trousers...

363
00:24:51,774 --> 00:24:54,305
samejackets,
even the same shoes.

364
00:25:05,776 --> 00:25:08,231
Hey, mister,
has your coat got fleas?

365
00:25:31,018 --> 00:25:34,498
Who are those two gorgeous
women in the kitchen?

366
00:25:35,928 --> 00:25:40,565
- Did you miss me, Bridie?
- Look at Gerry. He's a hippie!

367
00:25:40,646 --> 00:25:41,672
Daddy, look at the money!

368
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:43,635
- Do you want it?
- Oh, my God!

369
00:25:43,715 --> 00:25:45,668
Do you wanna be in my gang?

370
00:25:45,749 --> 00:25:48,890
Yes, Gerry, I wanna be in your gang.
I wanna be in your gang.

371
00:25:48,971 --> 00:25:50,956
- Over here.
- Take it easy.

372
00:25:51,042 --> 00:25:54,413
Steady. Calm it down.
Just calm it down.

373
00:25:54,495 --> 00:25:57,103
It's my money!
It's mine!

374
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,861
Calm it down. Stop it.

375
00:25:58,945 --> 00:26:00,548
- It's my money! He gave it to me!
- Stop that!

376
00:26:00,633 --> 00:26:01,898
Stop that!

377
00:26:07,193 --> 00:26:09,680
And they were always talking about
the troubles, were they?

378
00:26:10,914 --> 00:26:13,631
Yeah.
Especially Paul Hill.

379
00:26:13,714 --> 00:26:17,511
He was always talking about Belfast,
the IRA, all that stuff.

380
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,115
Look, all I'm saying is this:

381
00:26:22,192 --> 00:26:25,749
They had a lot of money,
and Conlon went back to Belfast.

382
00:26:25,836 --> 00:26:28,324
- Come along, into the car.
- What the fuck is going on?

383
00:26:30,363 --> 00:26:32,273
That was a bloody disgrace,
them shooting you.

384
00:26:32,358 --> 00:26:34,540
- Aye.
- Did it hurt you, Danny?

385
00:26:34,621 --> 00:26:37,796
It wasn't too bad. The bullet bounced
offthe kneecap and out the other side.

386
00:26:37,882 --> 00:26:39,256
Five people are dead...

387
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:42,514
and 75 seriously injured
as a result ofthe IRA 's...

388
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,972
no-warning bomb attack
on a Guildford pub.

389
00:26:46,053 --> 00:26:49,304
Parliament has passed
the Prevention of Terrorism Act...

390
00:26:49,391 --> 00:26:52,838
which allows terrorist suspects to be
held by police for up to seven days.

391
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,483
Seven days. Geez.

392
00:26:55,567 --> 00:26:58,327
It's the same here.
Seven days. No difference.

393
00:26:58,405 --> 00:27:02,355
...around London
and arrested 19 suspects.

394
00:27:02,433 --> 00:27:04,463
Gerry, there's your shoes.

395
00:27:04,543 --> 00:27:06,999
Our reporter spoke to Commander Robert
Dixon ofthe antiterrorist squad...

396
00:27:07,075 --> 00:27:08,723
about those arrests.

397
00:27:08,801 --> 00:27:10,983
We can't pretend
people won't be inconvenienced.

398
00:27:11,065 --> 00:27:12,865
Some ofthem may not deserve it.

399
00:27:12,945 --> 00:27:16,348
That's why we shall use these powers
as selectively as possible.

400
00:27:23,686 --> 00:27:26,141
Get up out ofbed,
you dirty, murdering bastard!

401
00:27:26,218 --> 00:27:27,440
Hands above your head!

402
00:27:29,325 --> 00:27:31,201
I don't knowwhat the fuck youse are
looking for, mister, but I'm not it.

403
00:27:31,281 --> 00:27:34,652
Gerry, your coat.
He's done nothing.

404
00:27:34,734 --> 00:27:36,076
- Inside, sir.
- He's not political.

405
00:27:36,153 --> 00:27:37,877
I have a right to speak to my son.

406
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,211
Keep calm, Gerry.

407
00:27:43,327 --> 00:27:45,694
Get back in.
Get back inside.

408
00:27:48,045 --> 00:27:50,882
It's all right.
It's all right.

409
00:28:04,925 --> 00:28:07,291
- Where are we going?
- You'll find out soon enough.

410
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:12,937
- Where'd he get this money?
- I don't know.

411
00:28:14,899 --> 00:28:17,462
They have no right
to take him to England.

412
00:28:20,001 --> 00:28:21,527
Slow down a bit.

413
00:29:11,252 --> 00:29:13,892
Look, I don't have a fucking clue
what this is about.

414
00:29:19,538 --> 00:29:21,414
I've done nothing wrong.

415
00:29:37,453 --> 00:29:39,482
When can I go back to Belfast?

416
00:29:39,563 --> 00:29:42,246
Next time you see Belfast, they'll be
flying day trips to the moon.

417
00:29:42,939 --> 00:29:45,044
I always wanted
to be an astronaut.

418
00:29:55,713 --> 00:29:57,622
What are you charging me with?

419
00:29:57,708 --> 00:30:00,271
You're being held
under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.

420
00:30:00,355 --> 00:30:01,380
What?

421
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:04,915
We can hold you for seven days
and seven nights without charging you.

422
00:30:04,997 --> 00:30:08,248
- When was I a fucking terrorist?
- Were you part ofthat, Gerry?

423
00:30:10,444 --> 00:30:13,237
And that.
You proud ofthat?

424
00:30:14,587 --> 00:30:17,380
- And that.
- Why are you showing me these people?

425
00:30:19,114 --> 00:30:21,721
No marks!
Don't mark him! Don't mark him!

426
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:23,326
Are you fucking proud ofthat?

427
00:30:24,484 --> 00:30:27,354
Look at that young,
pretty girl there!

428
00:30:27,438 --> 00:30:30,612
- Nowlook at her!
- You're out of your fucking minds!

429
00:30:30,699 --> 00:30:32,422
- Do you?
- You're out of your fucking minds!

430
00:30:34,995 --> 00:30:36,981
The children knowthere's
something terrible going on.

431
00:30:37,067 --> 00:30:40,787
- And you're not making it easier.
- I haven't the strength for this.

432
00:30:41,824 --> 00:30:43,733
Lfhe killed innocent people,
I haven't the strength for it.

433
00:30:43,818 --> 00:30:46,000
Listen, I knowthat child.
I carried that child.

434
00:30:46,082 --> 00:30:47,991
If you're not gonna
believe in him, I will.

435
00:30:48,077 --> 00:30:49,757
You think he's innocent?

436
00:30:49,841 --> 00:30:52,100
When your son walked through that door
looking like a bloody circus clown...

437
00:30:52,181 --> 00:30:54,057
do you think he had murder
in his eyes?

438
00:30:55,058 --> 00:30:56,934
Happy birthday to you

439
00:30:57,015 --> 00:31:00,004
- It's a surprise.
- Shut up. Shut up!

440
00:31:13,971 --> 00:31:16,033
When will Daddy be back?

441
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:17,995
He'll be back
in a couple of days.

442
00:31:19,725 --> 00:31:21,558
Why did they put
Gerry in jail?

443
00:31:21,643 --> 00:31:23,170
It's a mistake.

444
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,166
I'm on my way over
to bring him back home.

445
00:31:27,244 --> 00:31:29,349
Why are you getting
narky again?

446
00:31:30,965 --> 00:31:32,721
Are we touching a sore spot?

447
00:31:32,806 --> 00:31:34,836
Name all the places you stayed
while you were in England.

448
00:31:35,952 --> 00:31:37,600
I told you about 100 times.

449
00:31:37,678 --> 00:31:38,900
Then tell us again!

450
00:31:42,704 --> 00:31:45,235
I stayed at the squat
most ofthe time.

451
00:31:45,312 --> 00:31:47,036
I was a couple of nights
at my Auntie Annie's...

452
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:49,526
and one night at the hotel
after I robbed the money.

453
00:32:04,531 --> 00:32:06,987
Male. Late forties.

454
00:32:07,063 --> 00:32:09,354
Who taught you
howto make the bomb, Gerry?

455
00:32:10,477 --> 00:32:12,583
I never made any bombs.

456
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:14,158
Did Annie make the bomb,
Gerry?

457
00:32:16,654 --> 00:32:18,072
Is Annie Marian, Gerry?

458
00:32:20,145 --> 00:32:21,290
Is Annie Marian?

459
00:32:22,715 --> 00:32:25,203
- Annie who?
- Annie Maguire!

460
00:32:25,285 --> 00:32:28,122
My Aunt Annie?

461
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,037
Oh, aye, Annie made the bomb,
and Mother Teresa planted it.

462
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:33,221
What was Carole Richardson's
part in this operation?

463
00:32:33,303 --> 00:32:35,288
Are you Marian?

464
00:32:38,673 --> 00:32:40,778
What?

465
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,038
Are you Marian?

466
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:45,574
She had nothing
to do with it.

467
00:32:49,453 --> 00:32:52,016
This man comes into my house.
He puts a gun to my head.

468
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,933
He says I done Guildford.

469
00:32:54,977 --> 00:32:58,577
I left Belfast to get away
from people like him.

470
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:02,063
Showme what you want me to sign.
I have an alibi for that night.

471
00:33:07,138 --> 00:33:09,593
What are you showing me
these for?

472
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:13,997
Gerry told us you did it.

473
00:33:14,081 --> 00:33:15,914
Then he's a fucking liar.

474
00:33:15,999 --> 00:33:20,102
Armstrong drove the car.
Who was the woman in the back?

475
00:33:22,981 --> 00:33:24,704
I don't know.

476
00:33:24,784 --> 00:33:27,806
But you were
in the Ford Cortina.

477
00:33:27,891 --> 00:33:30,651
But you were
in the red Ford Cortina.

478
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:32,759
He'll get used to your methods,
and then he'll clam up.

479
00:33:33,607 --> 00:33:38,124
I told you I was in the Cortina.
I told you it was a taxi.

480
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:40,392
No. The taxi was
a Toyota Corolla.

481
00:33:40,474 --> 00:33:42,656
When can I ring home?

482
00:33:42,737 --> 00:33:46,992
- Let's start again. Who's Marian?
- Was it someone Irish?

483
00:33:47,072 --> 00:33:50,520
Why are you getting narky again?
Touching a sore spot? What was her name?

484
00:33:50,601 --> 00:33:54,005
- Nothing to do with what, Gerry?
- Talk to me.

485
00:33:54,092 --> 00:33:55,586
You're evading the truth, Gerry.
What was her name?

486
00:33:55,665 --> 00:33:59,996
Two little girls asked me,
"Why was Daddy blown up?"

487
00:34:00,077 --> 00:34:01,986
Who taught you how
to make the bomb, Gerry?

488
00:34:06,099 --> 00:34:07,321
Talk to me.

489
00:34:13,657 --> 00:34:15,489
He'll do what he's told.

490
00:34:16,726 --> 00:34:18,482
Look at him.
He's a lying bastard.

491
00:34:18,567 --> 00:34:21,175
He's a right fucking comedian.
Aren't you, Gerry?

492
00:34:21,252 --> 00:34:23,543
- Who's Marian?
- I don't knowwhat...

493
00:34:23,631 --> 00:34:26,620
I'm getting fucking bored with this.
Who is Marian?

494
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:30,606
I'm gonna keep on asking until
you give me a fucking answer!

495
00:34:30,689 --> 00:34:32,108
- Who is Marian?
- I don't know!

496
00:34:32,185 --> 00:34:34,716
Yes, you fucking do!
Bollocks! Who is Marian?

497
00:34:39,627 --> 00:34:41,231
We knowwho Marian is.

498
00:34:51,404 --> 00:34:53,892
- Are you the man in charge?
- Yes, I am.

499
00:34:53,975 --> 00:34:56,615
For fuck's sake,
tell 'em to stop hurting me.

500
00:35:00,918 --> 00:35:02,751
I swear to God...

501
00:35:02,836 --> 00:35:05,596
I knowwhere I was
at the time ofthe bombings.

502
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:13,416
I was with a madman
called Charlie Burke.

503
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,063
Have you any other alibis?

504
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:19,246
I have told youse before...

505
00:35:19,332 --> 00:35:21,743
I was with Paul Hill
most ofthe day.

506
00:35:29,536 --> 00:35:31,598
Tell Gerry Conlon
like you said you would.

507
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:41,691
- Who's this?
- Gerry Conlon.

508
00:35:46,415 --> 00:35:48,019
Have you anything
to say to him?

509
00:35:49,676 --> 00:35:52,359
I've cleared my conscience.

510
00:35:52,438 --> 00:35:54,500
I advise you to do the same.

511
00:36:08,396 --> 00:36:09,923
There's your statement.

512
00:36:12,348 --> 00:36:14,180
I didn't do this.

513
00:36:15,225 --> 00:36:17,712
I didn't fucking do this!

514
00:36:22,398 --> 00:36:24,929
Please believe me.

515
00:36:25,007 --> 00:36:27,996
What are you doing to me?

516
00:36:32,027 --> 00:36:35,201
They wouldn't hold him
ifhe hadn't done something.

517
00:36:36,247 --> 00:36:39,346
- Gerry is no angel.
- I knowthat.

518
00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:41,264
He needs a strong hand.

519
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:48,400
You're all under arrest.

520
00:36:48,484 --> 00:36:50,819
- No, no, don't. Don't hurt the child!
- Put your hands up!

521
00:36:50,901 --> 00:36:53,890
You're all being held under
the Prevention of Terrorism Act.

522
00:37:00,683 --> 00:37:04,742
- Is Hill leading us up the garden path?
- I don't know.

523
00:37:10,542 --> 00:37:12,681
I can make him confess.

524
00:37:12,767 --> 00:37:14,447
Why don't you have
a word in his ear?

525
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:17,249
You're from the same town.
He'll understand you.

526
00:37:17,332 --> 00:37:19,165
Will you have the bomber?

527
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,312
Ourjob is
to stop the bombing.

528
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:23,195
I'm gonna shoot your da.

529
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,568
What did you say to me?

530
00:38:28,915 --> 00:38:32,712
Little Bridie'll
have no daddy.

531
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:34,851
I'm gonna shoot Giuseppe.

532
00:38:44,528 --> 00:38:46,361
He's threatening to shoot my da!

533
00:38:46,446 --> 00:38:49,239
He's threatening to kill my da!

534
00:38:49,323 --> 00:38:50,971
Look at him!
Look at him!

535
00:38:52,316 --> 00:38:53,886
He's a madman!

536
00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:57,598
I think you're hallucinating.
Nobody's gonna harm your father.

537
00:38:59,297 --> 00:39:01,708
Get him back.
Get him back.

538
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:05,510
He threatened to kill my da.

539
00:39:05,589 --> 00:39:07,465
Nobody's gonna kill your father.

540
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:10,382
- You mad bastard!
- Take it easy, son. Take it easy.

541
00:39:12,072 --> 00:39:13,828
He's not gonna harm your father.

542
00:39:15,371 --> 00:39:17,705
Come on, let it all out.

543
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:19,620
Let it all out...
all that hatred.

544
00:39:23,887 --> 00:39:26,026
You hate us, don't you?

545
00:39:26,112 --> 00:39:28,600
You hate us enough
to bomb and maim.

546
00:39:28,682 --> 00:39:31,672
That is the trouble.
You let it all out. Come on.

547
00:39:31,751 --> 00:39:34,544
- I don't hate you.
- Yes, you do.

548
00:39:34,628 --> 00:39:37,880
I can see it in your face.
I can see all that hatred.

549
00:39:37,966 --> 00:39:40,333
So why don't you just
let it off your chest...

550
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:42,755
before it starts to mess up
with your mind?

551
00:39:48,746 --> 00:39:50,469
Give me the fucking statement.

552
00:39:50,549 --> 00:39:54,498
For fuck's sake,
give me the statement.

553
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:58,291
Give me a fucking pen.

554
00:40:05,164 --> 00:40:09,452
Right, that's my fucking name there.
You can write what you like.

555
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,751
All right, nice and easy.
Come on.

556
00:40:13,834 --> 00:40:17,238
- Paul! What's going on?
- Gerry!

557
00:40:17,325 --> 00:40:19,736
They stuck a fucking gun
in my mouth!

558
00:40:19,818 --> 00:40:21,466
So I told 'em
a lot ofbullshit!

559
00:40:21,545 --> 00:40:24,491
- Why did you give 'em my fucking name?
- I'm sorry!

560
00:40:24,575 --> 00:40:28,831
It's fucking mad!
Lt'll be laughed out of fucking court!

561
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:31,169
Lt'll be laughed
out of fucking court!

562
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:33,858
The four of us were split up.

563
00:40:33,936 --> 00:40:36,576
I was taken to
South London Remand Centre.

564
00:40:36,659 --> 00:40:39,070
You can check the dates, Gareth.

565
00:40:46,211 --> 00:40:47,935
Kill that fucker!

566
00:40:50,316 --> 00:40:54,113
You fucking son
of an Irish cow!

567
00:40:57,988 --> 00:41:00,825
Kick that Irish fucking ass!

568
00:41:00,865 --> 00:41:02,775
- What is that?
- Delousing.

569
00:41:02,822 --> 00:41:04,545
I don't have fucking lice.
I don't want that.

570
00:41:04,625 --> 00:41:06,458
You have no choice, mate.

571
00:41:06,543 --> 00:41:08,834
You'll never clean the scum
offthat...

572
00:41:08,921 --> 00:41:11,943
Okay, Conlon.
Go see the room, shall we?

573
00:41:16,939 --> 00:41:18,892
Come on, Mr Conlon.

574
00:41:23,959 --> 00:41:25,792
We got your son.

575
00:41:27,642 --> 00:41:28,984
Let's go.

576
00:41:30,596 --> 00:41:33,473
Da!

577
00:41:33,473 --> 00:41:35,153
Is that you, son?

578
00:41:35,237 --> 00:41:39,722
- Da, here!
- Where are you?

579
00:41:43,025 --> 00:41:45,513
Don't harm my father.
Don't harm my father!

580
00:41:45,595 --> 00:41:46,969
- Are you all right, son?
- Don't kill him!

581
00:41:52,308 --> 00:41:55,531
Come on, move along.
Move along. Come on, you.

582
00:41:55,531 --> 00:41:58,094
- Fuck you!
- Shut up, you!

583
00:41:59,367 --> 00:42:01,320
- Shut up!
- On the floor!

584
00:42:01,592 --> 00:42:05,116
You look fucking brave now.

585
00:42:11,834 --> 00:42:14,712
What the fuck
are you doing here, Da?

586
00:42:14,712 --> 00:42:17,886
I come over to your Aunt Annie's
to get you a lawyer.

587
00:42:17,972 --> 00:42:19,507
They arrested everybody
in the house.

588
00:42:19,507 --> 00:42:21,425
What?

589
00:42:21,425 --> 00:42:24,302
- What for, fuck's sake?
- Conspiracy to murder.

590
00:42:24,302 --> 00:42:26,593
Oh, no.
Oh, fuck's sake, no. Geez.

591
00:42:32,013 --> 00:42:35,570
Did you do it?
Did you do it, son?

592
00:42:35,657 --> 00:42:37,108
No, I did not!

593
00:42:41,565 --> 00:42:44,248
Of course I fucking
didn't do it, fuck's sake!

594
00:42:54,684 --> 00:42:56,899
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- What?

595
00:43:01,091 --> 00:43:03,273
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- Like what?

596
00:43:03,354 --> 00:43:05,230
Why do you always followme?

597
00:43:08,188 --> 00:43:10,980
Why do you always followme
when I do something wrong?

598
00:43:11,065 --> 00:43:13,705
Why can't you followme
when I do something right?

599
00:43:13,789 --> 00:43:16,080
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about?

600
00:43:16,167 --> 00:43:18,534
- I'm talking about the medal.
- What medal?

601
00:43:18,622 --> 00:43:21,230
What fucking medal?
What fucking medal?

602
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:25,410
The only fucking medal that was ever
in our house. That fucking medal.

603
00:43:25,489 --> 00:43:28,096
The medal I won at football.

604
00:43:28,174 --> 00:43:30,433
And you sat on the sidelines
shouting instructions...

605
00:43:30,476 --> 00:43:31,850
like you could only see
what I was doing...

606
00:43:31,934 --> 00:43:34,312
you couldn't even
fucking play football...

607
00:43:34,312 --> 00:43:36,920
and you could only see
what I was doing wrong.

608
00:43:36,997 --> 00:43:38,983
I could never do anything
good enough for you.

609
00:43:39,069 --> 00:43:41,752
And after the game,
you came up to me and said...

610
00:43:41,831 --> 00:43:44,743
"Gerry, did you foul the ball?"

611
00:43:44,823 --> 00:43:48,118
And I walked away from you, remember?
I walked away into the dressing room.

612
00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:51,341
You followed me in there and said again,
"Gerry, did you foul the ball?"

613
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:53,560
All the other fathers were in there
laughing at you...

614
00:43:53,838 --> 00:43:55,411
calling you "Poor Giuseppe."

615
00:43:55,411 --> 00:43:58,968
And I ran out, and I hid,
and I wrote your name on the ground...

616
00:43:59,055 --> 00:44:00,582
your stupid Giuseppe fucking name...

617
00:44:00,666 --> 00:44:03,001
I wrote it in the dirt,
and I fucking pissed on it!

618
00:44:04,925 --> 00:44:06,919
I pissed on it...

619
00:44:06,919 --> 00:44:09,527
because I did foul the ball.

620
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:13,357
What did it matter? We won.
For once in our lives, we won.

621
00:44:13,441 --> 00:44:16,201
You ruined that medal for me! I took it
to the pawn, and they laughed at me.

622
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,735
- They wouldn't give me 50 pence for it.
- This is shock.

623
00:44:18,811 --> 00:44:22,914
And that's when I started to rob,
to prove that I was no good.

624
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:25,141
- Delayed shock.
- Never mind delayed shock.

625
00:44:25,141 --> 00:44:28,011
I've been like this
since I was seven.

626
00:44:28,057 --> 00:44:30,697
I remember Mammy said to me,
"Don't upset Giuseppe. He's not well."

627
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:33,773
Oh, dear Lord, he's not well.
So we'd tiptoe around the house.

628
00:44:33,773 --> 00:44:37,984
Like this, tiptoeing around the house.
"Not well, you know. He's not well."

629
00:44:38,069 --> 00:44:40,486
Then I got Holy Communion.
I thought I was eating you alive.

630
00:44:40,486 --> 00:44:43,246
Is it my fault you weren't well?

631
00:44:43,325 --> 00:44:45,855
Why did you have to be sick
all your life, Giuseppe?

632
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,962
What'd you have to be sick
all your life for?

633
00:44:48,043 --> 00:44:51,447
When that mad bastard out there
threatened to shoot you, I was happy.

634
00:44:51,534 --> 00:44:53,519
I swear to God.
Honest to God, I was happy.

635
00:44:53,605 --> 00:44:56,169
I was delighted! You knowwhy?
Because finally it was all over.

636
00:44:56,252 --> 00:44:59,242
It was over!
You see?

637
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:01,503
And then I knewl was bad.

638
00:45:01,585 --> 00:45:04,345
I knewl was bad then, you see,
so I started to cry.

639
00:45:04,423 --> 00:45:06,380
I started to tell lies...
the same fucking lies...

640
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:09,249
I've been telling
all my gobshite fucking life.

641
00:45:15,011 --> 00:45:17,888
- That means words don't mean nothing.
- Stop this.

642
00:45:17,888 --> 00:45:20,452
Only this time,
I got everyone into trouble.

643
00:45:20,535 --> 00:45:23,372
But it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm
no good anyhow. It doesn't matter.

644
00:45:23,451 --> 00:45:26,014
Keep away from me. You've been
following me all your life.

645
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:30,124
- Are you here deliberately?
- No. Stop it.

646
00:45:31,392 --> 00:45:32,995
You call that a fucking dig, huh?

647
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:37,029
Do you call that a fucking dig?
Hit me harder. Hit me fucking harder!

648
00:45:37,069 --> 00:45:38,979
- Stop it. Calm down.
- For once in your fucking life!

649
00:45:39,064 --> 00:45:41,203
- Hit me like a real father!
- Just calm down. Stop it.

650
00:45:49,422 --> 00:45:51,298
Just relax.

651
00:45:52,836 --> 00:45:54,330
Try to relax.

652
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,604
It's okay.

653
00:46:07,605 --> 00:46:10,365
It's not your fault,
son, all right?

654
00:46:10,444 --> 00:46:13,356
Everything's gonna be
all right.

655
00:46:13,436 --> 00:46:16,119
Okay.
All right, son.

656
00:46:17,771 --> 00:46:19,800
Visitor for Conlon!

657
00:46:22,144 --> 00:46:24,020
Two on for visit!

658
00:46:32,463 --> 00:46:34,373
No touching.

659
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:38,789
- Everybody else was allowed to touch.
- IRA, closed visits. No contact.

660
00:46:49,381 --> 00:46:51,410
Why are you doing this to us?

661
00:46:53,562 --> 00:46:56,246
You have your father
locked up in prison for murder.

662
00:46:56,324 --> 00:46:57,666
Speak up, please.

663
00:46:57,936 --> 00:47:01,809
- It's not my fault, Ma.
- Take it easy, Sarah.

664
00:47:05,915 --> 00:47:08,784
I swear to God,
I've done nothing wrong.

665
00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:11,050
Why did you sign
a confession, son?

666
00:47:11,132 --> 00:47:13,815
He did it
to protect me, love.

667
00:47:13,894 --> 00:47:16,654
You have a good son there.
That's all you need to know.

668
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:19,525
You didn't sign anything
yourself, did you, Giuseppe?

669
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:22,447
The only thing I said
was I wanted to see you.

670
00:47:22,525 --> 00:47:26,082
Look, they've no statement
nor evidence against me.

671
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:30,228
I'll be out and home soon.
Sure I'm only visiting here myself.

672
00:47:31,617 --> 00:47:33,679
I'll be able to help out
Gerry while I'm in here.

673
00:47:36,412 --> 00:47:38,212
Danny's dead, Gerry.

674
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:40,506
What?

675
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:45,573
They found his body
on waste ground.

676
00:47:45,657 --> 00:47:48,527
The IRA said he was
an incurable thief.

677
00:47:51,412 --> 00:47:54,630
I sent a Mass card
from the family.

678
00:47:57,818 --> 00:48:00,807
This one'll not go to school
since you've been away.

679
00:48:00,887 --> 00:48:02,610
Hey, you go to school
for your mammy.

680
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:04,294
Yes, Daddy.

681
00:48:05,337 --> 00:48:07,628
Daddy, when will you be home?

682
00:48:09,557 --> 00:48:12,731
I've pressed your Sunday suits
for the trial.

683
00:48:12,817 --> 00:48:14,923
You make sure
and look your best now, son.

684
00:48:17,306 --> 00:48:20,709
But is there nitro
or was there not nitro?

685
00:48:20,797 --> 00:48:23,743
Yes, there are
traces of nitro.

686
00:48:23,827 --> 00:48:25,857
But are they all positive?

687
00:48:25,899 --> 00:48:29,194
Well, yes, on six ofthem.

688
00:48:29,275 --> 00:48:33,148
- Who'd we miss?
- The aunt, Aggie... Annie.

689
00:48:33,226 --> 00:48:35,757
But her rubber glove
showed a faint trace.

690
00:48:36,832 --> 00:48:38,326
And the children?

691
00:48:39,364 --> 00:48:40,661
Positive.

692
00:48:42,778 --> 00:48:45,341
The results may not
be good enough for court.

693
00:48:45,425 --> 00:48:48,567
Your word will be
good enough for the court.

694
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,099
Yes, sir.

695
00:48:56,089 --> 00:48:58,381
Kill the bastards!
Kill 'em!

696
00:49:04,145 --> 00:49:05,749
Shoot the bastards!

697
00:49:19,221 --> 00:49:21,480
Call number one.

698
00:49:24,899 --> 00:49:26,884
- Let's go.
- Jesus, it's a nightmare, Giuseppe.

699
00:49:26,971 --> 00:49:30,647
Just stay calm, be on your best
behaviour, and this'll be behind us soon.

700
00:49:31,382 --> 00:49:32,876
That's it, come on.

701
00:49:37,635 --> 00:49:39,315
It'll be all right.

702
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,171
All rise.

703
00:50:09,015 --> 00:50:13,270
Sir Michael Hagerty will present
the case on behalf ofthe Crown.

704
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:21,323
There are two series of charges here,
ladies and gentlemen.

705
00:50:21,406 --> 00:50:24,580
The four defendants in front...

706
00:50:24,666 --> 00:50:29,456
are charged with 11 counts in relation
to the explosion ofthe Guildford pub...

707
00:50:29,538 --> 00:50:31,524
and the murders of five people.

708
00:50:31,802 --> 00:50:34,671
The Crown will show
that these were the bombers.

709
00:50:34,756 --> 00:50:36,817
The seven defendants behind...

710
00:50:36,904 --> 00:50:41,115
are charged with the possession
of explosives, not charged with murder.

711
00:50:41,392 --> 00:50:43,607
The Crown's case
against them is...

712
00:50:43,694 --> 00:50:46,760
that they are a support network
for the bombers, and as such...

713
00:50:46,839 --> 00:50:50,669
- should be considered independent.
- Control yourself. Pay attention.

714
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:54,969
My first witness is
Inspector Robert Dixon.

715
00:50:55,049 --> 00:50:58,348
I swear by Almighty God that the
evidence I give shall be the truth...

716
00:50:58,348 --> 00:51:00,257
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

717
00:51:03,565 --> 00:51:07,439
Inspector, why do you believe
these four are the bombers?

718
00:51:08,897 --> 00:51:13,567
First Hill, then Conlon,
Armstrong, Richardson...

719
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:15,454
confessed to the bombing.

720
00:51:15,534 --> 00:51:17,137
They are the IRA's ASU.

721
00:51:17,222 --> 00:51:19,785
Can you explain ASUs for us?

722
00:51:19,869 --> 00:51:22,662
Active Service Unit.
They are the elite ofthe IRA...

723
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,579
who carry out
the bombings and the shootings.

724
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:28,417
Often they are combat veterans with
experience of shooting at soldiers...

725
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,562
and planting explosives.

726
00:51:30,648 --> 00:51:33,518
And the others...
Annie Maguire and her family?

727
00:51:33,602 --> 00:51:35,664
They are the IRA's support network.

728
00:51:35,751 --> 00:51:40,420
Their families and friends store
the weapons and explosives...

729
00:51:40,507 --> 00:51:44,032
and they provide
what we call "safe houses."

730
00:51:44,113 --> 00:51:46,295
Thank you, Inspector.

731
00:51:48,065 --> 00:51:50,127
These people were arrested
two days...

732
00:51:50,175 --> 00:51:53,011
after the Prevention
of Terrorism Act was introduced.

733
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:54,923
That's correct.

734
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:57,839
Can you explain, please, the powers
that this gives to the police?

735
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:00,686
It permits us to hold
suspected terrorists...

736
00:52:00,686 --> 00:52:03,326
for a period of up to seven days.

737
00:52:03,409 --> 00:52:05,395
Quite extraordinary powers
in a democracy.

738
00:52:05,481 --> 00:52:08,318
Quite difficult, I would think for
the police to resist the temptation...

739
00:52:08,358 --> 00:52:10,616
- to deal forcibly with people.
- Objection.

740
00:52:10,698 --> 00:52:14,112
People they suspect ofthe biggest
bombing campaign on British mainland...

741
00:52:14,112 --> 00:52:16,982
- since the Second World War.
- Objection. My lord, I really must...

742
00:52:17,028 --> 00:52:20,552
- Get to the point!
- Now, this bombing campaign...

743
00:52:20,634 --> 00:52:24,311
struck deep into the British people's
sense of security.

744
00:52:24,393 --> 00:52:27,459
The people looked to you,
Inspector, to find those responsible.

745
00:52:27,539 --> 00:52:28,487
Yes.

746
00:52:29,457 --> 00:52:31,333
You must have been under
the most intense pressure.

747
00:52:31,375 --> 00:52:33,284
That's my job.

748
00:52:33,331 --> 00:52:36,168
Now, all ofthe defendants claim...

749
00:52:36,247 --> 00:52:39,847
including young Patrick Maguire,
aged just 14...

750
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:41,839
Patrick,
would you stand up, please?

751
00:52:43,842 --> 00:52:46,209
Thank you.
All ofthe defendants claim...

752
00:52:46,298 --> 00:52:50,171
that they were subjected to physical and
mental abuse while in police custody.

753
00:52:52,090 --> 00:52:54,305
They were never harmed
in any way.

754
00:52:54,392 --> 00:52:56,923
He's fucking lying!
They beat the shite out of us!

755
00:52:59,187 --> 00:53:00,136
Silence!

756
00:53:02,678 --> 00:53:04,783
Please believe us!
They beat us!

757
00:53:05,478 --> 00:53:06,820
Just be quiet.

758
00:53:06,859 --> 00:53:08,778
Sit them down!

759
00:53:08,778 --> 00:53:10,653
Silence in the court!

760
00:53:13,573 --> 00:53:15,558
Mr Conlon says...

761
00:53:15,836 --> 00:53:19,131
that you pulled him by the hair
and squeezed his testicles.

762
00:53:19,212 --> 00:53:21,743
I never even spoke to Mr Conlon.

763
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:23,730
I hope you burn in hell, Dixon.

764
00:53:23,815 --> 00:53:25,463
Silence!

765
00:53:25,542 --> 00:53:29,523
Mr Hill says the police sat astride him
and put a gun in his mouth.

766
00:53:30,835 --> 00:53:33,050
There was no pressure of any kind.

767
00:53:33,137 --> 00:53:35,701
You can go and fuck yourself,
you lying fucking bastard!

768
00:53:35,976 --> 00:53:37,154
Order! Order in court!

769
00:53:37,242 --> 00:53:40,460
Inspector, in the case
ofthe four main defendants...

770
00:53:40,733 --> 00:53:42,762
you have no corroborating evidence
of any kind.

771
00:53:42,843 --> 00:53:46,061
I have the confessions of four obvious
terrorists. What more do you want?

772
00:53:46,142 --> 00:53:49,590
Well, nitroglycerine
is a highly toxic substance.

773
00:53:49,671 --> 00:53:51,624
It's when the substance
to be tested...

774
00:53:51,704 --> 00:53:54,159
After a fewweeks,
we were bored out of our minds...

775
00:53:54,236 --> 00:53:56,069
just messed around
and that there.

776
00:53:57,535 --> 00:54:00,066
They must've been
desperate for evidence.

777
00:54:00,144 --> 00:54:04,279
They produced Annie's washing-up gloves
like a rabbit out of a hat at one point.

778
00:54:04,364 --> 00:54:07,124
Then it was my turn
to take the stand.

779
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:10,115
Mr Conlon,
did you bomb Guildford?

780
00:54:11,115 --> 00:54:12,991
No, I didn't.

781
00:54:13,033 --> 00:54:15,750
The police claim that you were in
Guildford on the night ofthe bombing.

782
00:54:15,834 --> 00:54:17,557
Can you tell us where you were?

783
00:54:17,637 --> 00:54:20,506
I was in a park in London
at that time.

784
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:23,274
- Who with?
- With Paul Hill sitting there.

785
00:54:24,465 --> 00:54:26,756
You met somebody else that night,
about 8:00 p.m.

786
00:54:26,843 --> 00:54:31,255
- Aye, I met a man called Charlie Burke.
- And who is he?

787
00:54:31,255 --> 00:54:35,434
He wasjust a fellow,
a homeless guy that we met in the park.

788
00:54:35,513 --> 00:54:37,652
Why do you remember
this man so clearly?

789
00:54:38,851 --> 00:54:42,483
I was thinking that ifl didn't get out
ofLondon fast, I would end up like him.

790
00:54:42,572 --> 00:54:45,641
- You told this to the police?
- Aye.

791
00:54:45,641 --> 00:54:48,553
- What did they say?
- They said he didn't exist.

792
00:54:48,825 --> 00:54:53,080
Mr Conlon, why did you confess
to the Guildford bombing?

793
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:57,149
They beat me...

794
00:54:57,149 --> 00:54:58,982
and then they threatened
to kill my father.

795
00:54:59,067 --> 00:55:03,552
- Will you repeat that please?
- They terrorized me for seven days.

796
00:55:03,632 --> 00:55:05,814
After that,
they threatened to kill my father.

797
00:55:06,087 --> 00:55:08,543
I'd have fucking signed anything
after that.

798
00:55:09,617 --> 00:55:11,951
- Excuse my language.
- Thank you.

799
00:55:14,105 --> 00:55:17,662
You expect thisjury to believe
that decorated police officers...

800
00:55:17,749 --> 00:55:20,848
would risk their career
and their reputation...

801
00:55:20,933 --> 00:55:23,043
by threatening your father?

802
00:55:23,043 --> 00:55:25,498
I don't expect them to believe it
by the time you finish with them...

803
00:55:25,575 --> 00:55:27,528
but it happens to be truth.

804
00:55:27,608 --> 00:55:29,747
You're an honest man,
aren't you, Mr Conlon?

805
00:55:30,716 --> 00:55:32,242
I like to think so.

806
00:55:32,327 --> 00:55:36,385
You've told us you remember
this Charlie Burke very well.

807
00:55:37,391 --> 00:55:38,994
Aye.

808
00:55:39,078 --> 00:55:42,679
Do you remember telling the police
anything else about that night?

809
00:55:43,874 --> 00:55:46,481
Let me refresh your memory.
You told Inspector Dixon...

810
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:48,970
that you had committed
a robbery on that night.

811
00:55:49,244 --> 00:55:51,229
Now do you remember?

812
00:55:54,116 --> 00:55:55,535
Aye.

813
00:55:55,612 --> 00:56:00,129
- Who did you rob?
- Robbed a hooker.

814
00:56:00,216 --> 00:56:03,314
- You robbed a prostitute?
- Aye.

815
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:07,191
And we are expected to believe a man
who claims he stole from a prostitute...

816
00:56:07,466 --> 00:56:10,995
before we would believe ten police
officers who stood here on oath...

817
00:56:10,995 --> 00:56:12,719
and called you a liar?

818
00:56:12,798 --> 00:56:16,355
That was the truth.

819
00:56:16,443 --> 00:56:19,627
I'm bound to say I don't find
you very convincing.

820
00:56:19,627 --> 00:56:21,536
Thank you, Mr Conlon.

821
00:56:25,688 --> 00:56:28,983
Why didn't you tell me
that you'd stole from that woman?

822
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:33,049
You should've called me.
I would've sent the money.

823
00:56:40,112 --> 00:56:43,101
Are you gonna be a thief
and a liar all your life?

824
00:56:45,521 --> 00:56:49,350
Standing up in that witness box,
making faces to your mates.

825
00:57:01,211 --> 00:57:04,429
At least you told the truth
in there. That'll stand you.

826
00:57:10,494 --> 00:57:12,370
Are you not going
to eat that sausage?

827
00:57:16,939 --> 00:57:19,427
They put a gun in my mouth...

828
00:57:19,509 --> 00:57:23,720
and made me confess
to a murder I didn't commit.

829
00:57:23,806 --> 00:57:26,337
So I said I did the big bombing...

830
00:57:26,414 --> 00:57:29,637
and named anybody I knew
who was not in the IRA.

831
00:57:29,637 --> 00:57:31,555
Not in the IRA?

832
00:57:31,555 --> 00:57:34,424
- Definitely not in the IRA.
- Why?

833
00:57:35,928 --> 00:57:37,302
You knowwhy.

834
00:57:42,027 --> 00:57:44,744
I just wanted to show
howridiculous it all was.

835
00:57:44,828 --> 00:57:48,548
Inspector, the defendant Conlon
presented an alibi...

836
00:57:48,626 --> 00:57:50,736
One Charlie Burke.

837
00:57:50,736 --> 00:57:54,063
That name did appear in Mr Conlon's
statement. We investigated it.

838
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:56,833
We couldn't find any trace
of such a person.

839
00:57:56,912 --> 00:57:59,246
And there was this question
ofthe robbery of a prostitute.

840
00:57:59,329 --> 00:58:02,241
No robberies were reported
in that area that night.

841
00:58:02,321 --> 00:58:05,572
At the start ofthis trial,
I shook Gerry Conlon's hand.

842
00:58:07,039 --> 00:58:09,916
Subsequently, I was deeply shocked
when a fellowattorney came to me...

843
00:58:09,916 --> 00:58:12,372
and asked me ifl was now
going to wash my hand.

844
00:58:13,829 --> 00:58:16,513
In my long legal career,
I cannot remember a case...

845
00:58:16,591 --> 00:58:18,544
where emotions have
been so charged.

846
00:58:19,507 --> 00:58:21,425
It falls to me now
to appeal to you...

847
00:58:21,425 --> 00:58:24,302
the members ofthejury,
not to get caught up in this...

848
00:58:24,302 --> 00:58:26,910
tide of mass hysteria.

849
00:58:26,987 --> 00:58:31,974
Inspector Dixon admits there are scores
ofinconsistencies in the confessions.

850
00:58:31,974 --> 00:58:35,193
My clients contend that
they were forced to confess...

851
00:58:35,273 --> 00:58:38,372
through brutality
and intimidation.

852
00:58:39,992 --> 00:58:41,565
Now, they may be foolish...

853
00:58:41,565 --> 00:58:45,471
petty thieves,
even drug abusers...

854
00:58:45,746 --> 00:58:50,842
but they are not the ruthless bombers
who have terrorized Britain for months.

855
00:58:52,076 --> 00:58:55,796
You should find these young people
not guilty.

856
00:58:55,874 --> 00:58:58,863
- Bollocks!
- Okay, let's go.

857
00:58:59,134 --> 00:59:01,545
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Move it!

858
00:59:01,628 --> 00:59:03,428
- Move it!
- Hands off!

859
00:59:09,377 --> 00:59:10,871
Ladies and gentlemen...

860
00:59:12,983 --> 00:59:15,896
like my learned colleague
in the defence...

861
00:59:15,975 --> 00:59:19,608
I would caution you not
to be swayed by your emotions.

862
00:59:19,696 --> 00:59:23,570
The four people
you see in the front...

863
00:59:23,647 --> 00:59:27,400
are one ofthe most cunning and
cruel criminal conspiracies...

864
00:59:27,484 --> 00:59:30,476
ever to set foot on English soil.

865
00:59:30,476 --> 00:59:33,956
Now, here are the facts
ofthis case:

866
00:59:34,043 --> 00:59:35,919
Inspector Dixon...

867
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,105
a decorated officer
of great expertise...

868
00:59:38,148 --> 00:59:41,025
acting on reliable information
and good detective work...

869
00:59:41,025 --> 00:59:43,902
arrested Paul Hill...

870
00:59:43,902 --> 00:59:48,343
who, guilt-ridden by the shame
ofhis crime, confessed.

871
00:59:48,429 --> 00:59:52,106
That confession led the police
to the ringleader, Conlon...

872
00:59:52,189 --> 00:59:54,452
and his terrorist family...

873
00:59:54,452 --> 00:59:59,121
his aunt, Annie Maguire,
the experienced bomb maker...

874
00:59:59,209 --> 01:00:01,772
who wore rubber gloves
when handling explosives...

875
01:00:01,856 --> 01:00:04,648
in the kitchen
ofher home in Harlesden.

876
01:00:04,733 --> 01:00:07,416
She even allowed her children
to handle explosives...

877
01:00:07,495 --> 01:00:10,441
Vincent, aged 16,
Patrick, 14...

878
01:00:10,525 --> 01:00:15,162
who did not... could not...
knowany better.

879
01:00:15,244 --> 01:00:17,196
Giuseppe Conlon,
her brother-in-law...

880
01:00:17,277 --> 01:00:20,037
the courier who arrived
with more explosives.

881
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:24,142
Armstrong and his dupe
Richardson, who carried the bomb.

882
01:00:24,182 --> 01:00:26,516
Now, these are the people who,
in a panic...

883
01:00:26,599 --> 01:00:30,658
had to dispose
ofthe nitroglycerine...

884
01:00:30,742 --> 01:00:33,459
and that is what sealed
their fate.

885
01:00:33,542 --> 01:00:37,601
How do we knowthis?
Because the truth was on their hands.

886
01:00:41,023 --> 01:00:45,583
It is a story written
in the blood oftheir victims.

887
01:00:45,665 --> 01:00:48,501
You have seen some ofthose
who survived...

888
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:51,526
their callous disregard
for human life.

889
01:00:51,611 --> 01:00:55,746
It is nowyour duty
to protect society from them.

890
01:00:55,830 --> 01:00:59,660
I am confident that
that is what you will do.

891
01:01:34,192 --> 01:01:36,025
Have you reached a verdict?

892
01:01:37,491 --> 01:01:38,866
Yes, we have, my lord.

893
01:01:40,752 --> 01:01:44,232
- How do you find the defendants?
- Guilty as charged.

894
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:49,336
Hang the Irie bastards!

895
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:54,134
Order! Silence!

896
01:01:55,943 --> 01:01:57,623
String 'em up!

897
01:02:04,344 --> 01:02:06,800
Gerard Patrick Conlon.

898
01:02:08,104 --> 01:02:09,707
Stand up.

899
01:02:12,208 --> 01:02:16,038
I feel it is my duty
to wonder aloud...

900
01:02:16,121 --> 01:02:20,715
why you were not charged
with treason to the Crown...

901
01:02:20,801 --> 01:02:24,751
a charge that carries a penalty
of death by hanging...

902
01:02:24,829 --> 01:02:28,233
a sentence I would have had
no difficulty in passing...

903
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,808
in this case.

904
01:02:32,157 --> 01:02:34,032
I sentence you
to life imprisonment...

905
01:02:35,494 --> 01:02:37,403
and I instruct
that you shall serve...

906
01:02:37,489 --> 01:02:40,358
a minimum of 30 years.

907
01:02:41,785 --> 01:02:43,236
Take him down.

908
01:02:54,713 --> 01:02:56,087
Help me.

909
01:03:05,071 --> 01:03:07,209
Paul Michael Hill.

910
01:03:09,866 --> 01:03:13,892
In my view, your crime
is such that...

911
01:03:13,932 --> 01:03:16,191
life shall mean life.

912
01:03:16,272 --> 01:03:20,484
Annie Maguire,
I recommend you serve 14 years!

913
01:03:20,569 --> 01:03:22,554
- What have I done, for Christ's sake?
- Take her down!

914
01:03:23,523 --> 01:03:27,080
- Giuseppe Conlon, 12 years.
- No, my husband's innocent!

915
01:03:27,167 --> 01:03:28,318
Lord have mercy on you!

916
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:31,187
Patrick Joseph Armstrong,
30 years.

917
01:03:36,949 --> 01:03:40,320
Carole Richardson,
30 years.

918
01:04:34,147 --> 01:04:37,824
Our case was so insane that if you
made it up, nobody would believe it.

919
01:04:37,906 --> 01:04:40,895
Look, Gareth, I knowpeople say
that I'm a compulsive storyteller...

920
01:04:40,975 --> 01:04:43,123
and nobody believed
a word I said in court...

921
01:04:43,123 --> 01:04:46,648
but Charlie Burke did exist... he's not
just a figment of my imagination.

922
01:04:52,061 --> 01:04:53,239
Sorry.

923
01:05:04,836 --> 01:05:07,099
We were shipped off
to Park Royal Prison...

924
01:05:07,099 --> 01:05:11,430
an old Victorian fortress where the
most dangerous criminals were held...

925
01:05:11,511 --> 01:05:13,812
in the maximum-security wing.

926
01:05:13,812 --> 01:05:15,722
- Place ofbirth.
- Belfast.

927
01:05:15,769 --> 01:05:17,417
Then you're British.

928
01:05:17,495 --> 01:05:18,608
This is your home
for the rest of your life.

929
01:05:18,608 --> 01:05:21,139
So accept it and get on with it.
Right, come this way.

930
01:05:21,216 --> 01:05:22,438
The chief warder, Barker...

931
01:05:22,521 --> 01:05:25,739
gave us blue denim uniforms
with yellow stripes.

932
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:27,314
We were Category A...

933
01:05:27,584 --> 01:05:30,650
the highest-security class along
with the rapists and murderers.

934
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:32,989
My father said
we'd fight for an appeal...

935
01:05:33,032 --> 01:05:34,984
but I didn't want to know
about the legal system.

936
01:05:36,523 --> 01:05:38,552
- I'm going back to the cell.
- Come on. Followme.

937
01:05:49,297 --> 01:05:50,322
Come on, Gerry.

938
01:05:52,174 --> 01:05:55,502
Hey, Ronnie.
There's those Irish bastards, Ronnie.

939
01:05:57,353 --> 01:05:58,575
Irish scum.

940
01:05:58,657 --> 01:06:01,341
My name's Giuseppe Conlon.
I'm an innocent man.

941
01:06:01,419 --> 01:06:03,601
So is my son.

942
01:06:03,683 --> 01:06:05,254
We shouldn't even be in here.

943
01:06:05,332 --> 01:06:07,317
Get that fucking scum
off my floor.

944
01:06:10,856 --> 01:06:12,612
I said, knock it off!

945
01:06:30,536 --> 01:06:33,710
- They must knowthey've made a mistake.
- No, they don't.

946
01:06:33,797 --> 01:06:37,321
The proof of our innocence
must be there in the evidence.

947
01:06:37,594 --> 01:06:39,242
We have to fight 'em
to get an appeal.

948
01:06:41,085 --> 01:06:44,718
- I'll speak to Father Wilson.
- Speak to everybody.

949
01:06:44,806 --> 01:06:47,370
We'll write letters from in here.
Start a campaign.

950
01:06:47,453 --> 01:06:49,712
Have they been
treating you all right?

951
01:06:49,755 --> 01:06:51,511
Aye, fine. Fine.

952
01:06:52,248 --> 01:06:53,546
Have they, son?

953
01:06:55,202 --> 01:06:57,232
Aye. No problem.

954
01:07:08,897 --> 01:07:11,232
Landing officers, exercise.

955
01:07:13,769 --> 01:07:15,645
Forgot the dessert spoons.

956
01:07:17,452 --> 01:07:19,132
There we go.

957
01:07:29,114 --> 01:07:31,023
These chips are not bad.

958
01:07:37,477 --> 01:07:40,575
- Now don't you despair, son.
- Never mind about "don't despair."

959
01:07:40,853 --> 01:07:42,194
What?

960
01:07:42,272 --> 01:07:44,912
I mean, we're innocent,
we can't even go out ofthe cell.

961
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:51,046
You're better offbeing guilty.
At least you get some respect.

962
01:07:52,054 --> 01:07:54,542
Landing officers
on the threes for exercise.

963
01:07:54,624 --> 01:07:56,730
You can have my chips.

964
01:08:37,628 --> 01:08:40,006
Gerry, man.

965
01:08:40,006 --> 01:08:41,959
Problem? You all right?

966
01:08:44,801 --> 01:08:46,720
Howyou like your newhome?

967
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:49,589
Bombing of pillar-box,
Kensington High Street.

968
01:08:49,673 --> 01:08:51,515
Bombing of pillar-box,
Talbot Lodge.

969
01:08:51,515 --> 01:08:53,348
Bombing of naval club.

970
01:08:53,433 --> 01:08:56,310
Bombing of Aldershot Railway Station.
Attempted murder ofEdward Heath.

971
01:08:56,310 --> 01:08:58,721
Murder ofRoss McWhirter.

972
01:08:58,803 --> 01:09:02,677
Possession of firearms,
Balcombe Street, December 6, 1975.

973
01:09:02,755 --> 01:09:04,740
And the Guildford pub bombings.

974
01:09:06,514 --> 01:09:09,580
You have innocent people
in jail for that.

975
01:09:12,115 --> 01:09:13,566
Take him out.

976
01:09:36,475 --> 01:09:38,001
He did it.

977
01:09:38,086 --> 01:09:40,955
Where's all the missing pieces?

978
01:09:44,799 --> 01:09:47,559
We eat it up, man.

979
01:09:48,942 --> 01:09:50,927
Before my woman
send it in here, right...

980
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:53,616
she have it dipped
in liquid acid...

981
01:09:53,699 --> 01:09:56,307
LSD, man.

982
01:09:56,384 --> 01:09:59,603
We've been dropping the British Empire
for the last six months.

983
01:09:59,683 --> 01:10:02,139
You want to fly?
Pick a country.

984
01:10:02,215 --> 01:10:05,281
Fuck's sake, don't give me Northern
Ireland. I don't want a bad trip.

985
01:10:05,361 --> 01:10:08,274
Try Nepal, man.
Take you to the Himalayas.

986
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:27,067
See the dragon.

987
01:10:51,779 --> 01:10:54,768
Lights out in 15 minutes.
15 minutes.

988
01:11:05,205 --> 01:11:07,572
Are you praying
for the Seventh Cavalry?

989
01:11:09,463 --> 01:11:11,535
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

990
01:11:11,535 --> 01:11:15,092
Blessed art thou amongst women, and
blessed is the fruit ofthy womb, Jesus.

991
01:11:15,179 --> 01:11:16,903
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

992
01:11:16,982 --> 01:11:19,164
nowand at the moment of our death.
Amen.

993
01:11:19,207 --> 01:11:21,040
That's not funny, Gerry.

994
01:11:22,775 --> 01:11:27,292
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

995
01:11:28,798 --> 01:11:30,707
Blessed art thou among women...

996
01:11:30,792 --> 01:11:33,400
and blessed is the fruit
ofthy womb, Jesus.

997
01:11:36,470 --> 01:11:38,226
Holy Mary, mother of God...

998
01:11:38,311 --> 01:11:41,562
pray for us sinners, nowand
at the hour of our death. Amen.

999
01:11:49,896 --> 01:11:51,806
Are you on drugs?

1000
01:12:03,323 --> 01:12:07,688
Look, Da, I'll be older than you are
nowwhen I get out ofthis place.

1001
01:12:09,116 --> 01:12:10,872
Ifl get out.

1002
01:12:14,218 --> 01:12:18,047
- Are you listening to me?
- I'm not talking to you.

1003
01:12:18,131 --> 01:12:20,160
Nowwho's being childish?

1004
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:24,876
I haven't had a sensible word
out of you for two weeks.

1005
01:12:26,877 --> 01:12:28,251
That stuff'll kill you.

1006
01:12:29,754 --> 01:12:31,478
Sure I'm dead anyway.

1007
01:12:35,854 --> 01:12:40,109
Look, I'm sorry. I'll not
take it again so long as you live.

1008
01:12:41,224 --> 01:12:43,254
Are you happy now?

1009
01:12:44,984 --> 01:12:46,816
No.

1010
01:12:46,902 --> 01:12:48,778
Why not?

1011
01:12:51,620 --> 01:12:53,987
I don't want you to take it
whether I live or die.

1012
01:12:57,988 --> 01:12:59,559
Jesus Christ.

1013
01:13:04,433 --> 01:13:07,455
All right. I'll do nothing
to annoy you in your grave.

1014
01:13:09,535 --> 01:13:11,291
Noware you happy?

1015
01:13:12,297 --> 01:13:14,282
Is that a promise?

1016
01:13:17,169 --> 01:13:18,118
Aye.

1017
01:13:19,816 --> 01:13:20,994
Maybe.

1018
01:13:28,256 --> 01:13:31,322
Gerry, man,
check out your friend.

1019
01:13:33,434 --> 01:13:35,310
He look like the real thing.

1020
01:13:38,268 --> 01:13:39,686
Come on.

1021
01:13:52,270 --> 01:13:53,612
- Excuse me.
- All right.

1022
01:13:57,832 --> 01:13:59,708
Let's have a talk.

1023
01:14:02,896 --> 01:14:04,926
We have to eat in the cells.

1024
01:14:05,965 --> 01:14:07,645
See ya later.

1025
01:14:09,955 --> 01:14:11,831
Gerry, come on.

1026
01:14:36,156 --> 01:14:38,294
Morning, paddy.

1027
01:14:43,061 --> 01:14:44,283
Yes!

1028
01:14:51,731 --> 01:14:52,876
Come on!

1029
01:14:53,764 --> 01:14:54,986
Yes, man, Gerry!

1030
01:15:05,541 --> 01:15:09,141
This one, this one, this one,
14 days solitary! Lock up!

1031
01:15:10,221 --> 01:15:11,672
Lock up!

1032
01:15:11,755 --> 01:15:15,051
He'll be all right.
He'll be back in a couple of days.

1033
01:15:24,376 --> 01:15:26,209
I'm worried about Bridie.

1034
01:15:28,865 --> 01:15:30,042
Why?

1035
01:15:31,473 --> 01:15:34,081
She's dyed her hair blonde.

1036
01:15:35,348 --> 01:15:38,140
Well, she's only young.

1037
01:15:40,833 --> 01:15:43,321
She's wearing a dog collar.

1038
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:53,297
There's a fella chained to it.
He's got one on too.

1039
01:15:56,792 --> 01:15:58,625
Well...

1040
01:15:58,710 --> 01:16:01,077
as long as she's happy.

1041
01:16:11,561 --> 01:16:13,132
Lunch break.

1042
01:16:15,858 --> 01:16:17,767
Yes, Gerry, man!
That's right!

1043
01:16:17,852 --> 01:16:19,958
Gerry's a bad boy!

1044
01:16:20,039 --> 01:16:22,330
Put the Englishman
under heavy, heavy manners.

1045
01:16:22,609 --> 01:16:26,820
Yes, sir. Go on, boy.
Kick out them clods, yes?

1046
01:16:26,906 --> 01:16:30,004
This is Joe McAndrew.
He has something important to tell you.

1047
01:16:30,282 --> 01:16:31,656
Hello, Mr Conlon.

1048
01:16:34,118 --> 01:16:36,027
I'm watching you.

1049
01:16:46,892 --> 01:16:49,031
What is it?

1050
01:16:49,117 --> 01:16:51,757
I'm the one who planted
the Guildford bomb, Mr Conlon.

1051
01:16:55,332 --> 01:16:57,470
Did you tell the police that?

1052
01:16:57,557 --> 01:17:00,469
Yes, I did.

1053
01:17:00,549 --> 01:17:04,455
- But we haven't heard a thing.
- See what he has to say, Da.

1054
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:06,835
Go on.

1055
01:17:06,917 --> 01:17:10,899
I told them.
They knowthe truth.

1056
01:17:10,983 --> 01:17:13,624
They can't afford to face it.

1057
01:17:13,707 --> 01:17:16,773
It's a war.
You're one ifits innocent victims.

1058
01:17:16,853 --> 01:17:18,847
I'm sorry for your trouble.

1059
01:17:18,847 --> 01:17:20,833
Don't be sorry for us.

1060
01:17:21,111 --> 01:17:23,293
You should be sorry
for the people you killed.

1061
01:17:24,985 --> 01:17:27,898
It was a military target,
a soldier's pub.

1062
01:17:27,978 --> 01:17:32,274
They were innocent people,
God's children.

1063
01:17:32,274 --> 01:17:36,714
Look, I'll do all I can
to help you while you're in here.

1064
01:17:36,801 --> 01:17:38,023
We don't need your help.

1065
01:17:39,831 --> 01:17:42,198
I'd appreciate it
if you'd leave us alone.

1066
01:17:43,514 --> 01:17:44,812
Whatever you say.

1067
01:17:47,619 --> 01:17:49,528
I'm sorry about that.

1068
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:55,287
What was that all about?
You mind your fucking manners.

1069
01:17:55,329 --> 01:17:59,814
What? Manners to him? I don't want
any part ofhim, or his ways.

1070
01:17:59,894 --> 01:18:02,963
At least he fights back, which is
more than you ever did in your life.

1071
01:18:02,963 --> 01:18:05,451
- What are you talking about?
- Do you remember Lydon Hill?

1072
01:18:05,534 --> 01:18:08,217
You used to ride me up
on your bike up Lydon Hill.

1073
01:18:08,296 --> 01:18:10,205
And then one day
you couldn't make it to the top...

1074
01:18:10,290 --> 01:18:14,472
and I hopped off and looked back,
and your face was all red.

1075
01:18:14,472 --> 01:18:16,424
- Remember that?
- Aye.

1076
01:18:19,267 --> 01:18:21,481
It was working in the paint shed
done that to you.

1077
01:18:21,569 --> 01:18:22,791
What?

1078
01:18:22,873 --> 01:18:26,321
It was the fumes from working
in the paint shed done that to you.

1079
01:18:26,402 --> 01:18:28,769
Never mind jumping offthe ferry,
swimming back to Mammy.

1080
01:18:28,857 --> 01:18:32,228
It was the onejob a Catholic can get,
and you wouldn't even fight back then.

1081
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:37,220
Go on outside.
Play with your newfound friend.

1082
01:18:37,297 --> 01:18:41,279
All I'm saying is that you've been
a victim. It's time you fought back.

1083
01:18:41,325 --> 01:18:43,005
- Get out of my sight.
- I'm going.

1084
01:18:45,813 --> 01:18:48,988
This is the only way it'll work.
We have no alternative.

1085
01:19:05,301 --> 01:19:08,214
- Well, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

1086
01:19:09,713 --> 01:19:12,396
- They didn't do it.
- They all did it.

1087
01:19:15,850 --> 01:19:17,760
I'm going back to Belfast.

1088
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:27,737
After the fight, nobody stopped us
going out in the yard to exercise.

1089
01:19:27,819 --> 01:19:31,038
I felt brilliant.
Joe explained things to me.

1090
01:19:31,118 --> 01:19:33,988
He explained howthe Brits
never left anywhere without a fight...

1091
01:19:34,072 --> 01:19:37,323
howthey had to be beaten out of
every country they ever occupied...

1092
01:19:37,410 --> 01:19:40,628
howthis prison wasjust
an extension oftheir system.

1093
01:19:40,709 --> 01:19:43,043
Calling for work
on the threes.

1094
01:19:43,126 --> 01:19:46,038
We had to confront the chief
prison officer, Barker.

1095
01:19:46,118 --> 01:19:47,499
Mr Smalls.

1096
01:19:47,499 --> 01:19:50,376
But to do that,
we had to take care ofRonnie Smalls.

1097
01:19:50,376 --> 01:19:53,245
Can I have a word
about 54 Halsley Road?

1098
01:19:56,859 --> 01:19:58,659
Take a walk.

1099
01:20:05,721 --> 01:20:09,278
If anything happens to me
or Gerry...

1100
01:20:10,017 --> 01:20:12,434
or any other Irish prisoner...

1101
01:20:12,434 --> 01:20:16,612
we'll have 54 Halsley Road
blown to smithereens...

1102
01:20:16,692 --> 01:20:19,452
with your family in it.

1103
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:23,513
Threaten my family
and I'll cut your fucking head off.

1104
01:20:26,819 --> 01:20:28,652
I don't make threats.

1105
01:20:28,738 --> 01:20:32,567
I just carry out orders.
I don't want to hurt your family.

1106
01:20:37,369 --> 01:20:40,238
Your trouble is, Joe,
you want to rule the fucking world.

1107
01:20:42,624 --> 01:20:43,999
Paddy's all right.

1108
01:20:55,054 --> 01:20:56,548
Soon, we were all
one happy family.

1109
01:20:56,626 --> 01:20:58,307
Again!

1110
01:20:58,391 --> 01:21:01,228
Even Kojak was ready to forgive.

1111
01:21:01,307 --> 01:21:04,222
- Live and let live.
- Barker began to panic.

1112
01:21:04,222 --> 01:21:07,015
He told us to take our socks
out ofthe window.

1113
01:21:07,099 --> 01:21:09,587
He thought we were signalling
to other prisoners.

1114
01:21:09,669 --> 01:21:12,768
We're not signalling.
We're drying our socks out.

1115
01:21:12,853 --> 01:21:14,195
- Take the socks out ofthe window.
- Who says?

1116
01:21:14,273 --> 01:21:15,342
Mr Barker.

1117
01:21:15,424 --> 01:21:19,221
- That was all the excuseJoe needed.
- Give us two minutes.

1118
01:21:19,298 --> 01:21:21,513
- Up and away we went.
- Are you with me?

1119
01:21:21,792 --> 01:21:23,166
What's he up to now?

1120
01:21:26,242 --> 01:21:29,493
All prison officers
to vacate the wing.

1121
01:21:29,579 --> 01:21:31,684
All officers
vacate the wing!

1122
01:21:37,328 --> 01:21:39,084
This'll damage the whole campaign.

1123
01:21:39,170 --> 01:21:41,504
Look, you do it your way,
and we'll do it ours, all right?

1124
01:21:41,586 --> 01:21:45,187
- You can read our demands.
- Go back to your cells.

1125
01:21:45,269 --> 01:21:46,840
Blankets!

1126
01:21:47,686 --> 01:21:51,014
- For God's sake, put a stop to this.
- You're weakening my position.

1127
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:52,823
- It will end in violence.
- Good.

1128
01:21:52,903 --> 01:21:55,117
- What's good about it?
- It's all they understand.

1129
01:21:58,235 --> 01:21:59,916
Barker refused to negotiate.

1130
01:22:00,192 --> 01:22:02,144
But with the screws gone,
we'd a brieftaste of freedom.

1131
01:22:02,225 --> 01:22:03,490
Check out Ronnie!

1132
01:22:05,447 --> 01:22:07,509
Him swallowhalf Africa.

1133
01:22:08,324 --> 01:22:10,048
I give him about an hour.

1134
01:22:16,150 --> 01:22:18,867
We found out later
our protest got on TV.

1135
01:22:18,951 --> 01:22:21,362
And that's when
the riot squad was ordered in.

1136
01:22:35,753 --> 01:22:38,208
We were singled out
as the ringleaders.

1137
01:22:38,285 --> 01:22:39,463
Now!

1138
01:23:04,102 --> 01:23:06,393
You just signed
your own death warrant, Barker.

1139
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:11,802
Are you happy now?

1140
01:23:16,033 --> 01:23:18,400
And then you arrived, Gareth.

1141
01:23:18,488 --> 01:23:22,324
That's the first time I sawyou,
under a raining shower of sparks.

1142
01:23:22,324 --> 01:23:26,160
It was the first time I'd seen a woman
in five years, other than my mother.

1143
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:29,379
But to me, you were a lawyer first.
And I hated lawyers.

1144
01:23:29,459 --> 01:23:34,707
- Do you have a newisolation...
- Prisoners: Barth, Andrew.

1145
01:23:34,792 --> 01:23:37,669
Bailey, Benjamin.
McAndrew, Joseph.

1146
01:23:37,669 --> 01:23:40,461
- Sorry. Can you... I can't hear.
- Conlon, Gerard.

1147
01:23:40,546 --> 01:23:43,383
O'Brien, John.

1148
01:23:43,423 --> 01:23:46,794
Lynch, Bernard.
Crisp, Quincy.

1149
01:23:46,875 --> 01:23:49,167
Lyon, Richard.
Burns, Delrow.

1150
01:23:49,254 --> 01:23:53,007
What about Conlon?
Sorry. Giuseppe Conlon.

1151
01:23:53,090 --> 01:23:55,349
He's on the third floor.

1152
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:59,609
He has difficulty
getting down the stairs.

1153
01:23:59,688 --> 01:24:02,604
Well, I'll just have to
go up and see him then.

1154
01:24:02,604 --> 01:24:05,364
- The delegation has seen enough.
- Right-o. Sorry.

1155
01:24:05,442 --> 01:24:08,355
Well, I won't be a minute. I'll just...
Is that all right? Sorry.

1156
01:24:08,435 --> 01:24:11,806
I'll meet you outside, okay?
Sorry.

1157
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:19,098
Sorry, I can't...

1158
01:24:19,176 --> 01:24:21,129
Pulmonary thrombosis.

1159
01:24:21,209 --> 01:24:24,046
- And he's getting proper medication?
- Aye.

1160
01:24:28,536 --> 01:24:29,758
Son?

1161
01:24:32,411 --> 01:24:34,320
That's... Is it Gerry?

1162
01:24:34,405 --> 01:24:35,747
That's Gerry.

1163
01:24:35,825 --> 01:24:38,433
He's had a spot ofbother
with lawyers in the past.

1164
01:24:42,116 --> 01:24:44,909
He's all yours.
Fifteen minutes.

1165
01:24:44,993 --> 01:24:46,717
- Thank you.
- Sit down.

1166
01:24:53,433 --> 01:24:55,342
You wanted to see me, Gerry?

1167
01:25:15,222 --> 01:25:17,786
Why are you giving
my father false hope?

1168
01:25:17,869 --> 01:25:19,473
Sorry?

1169
01:25:19,557 --> 01:25:22,394
He's been up and down
these stairs to see you.

1170
01:25:22,473 --> 01:25:24,502
He hasn't even seen
my mother in six months.

1171
01:25:24,583 --> 01:25:27,299
I hear you're getting on
very well with her, by the way.

1172
01:25:27,383 --> 01:25:29,522
Yes. She's a very brave woman.

1173
01:25:29,608 --> 01:25:31,441
You don't knowthe half ofit.

1174
01:25:33,866 --> 01:25:35,699
The fucking stairs are killing him.

1175
01:25:35,784 --> 01:25:38,508
It's not the stairs that
are killing your father.

1176
01:25:38,508 --> 01:25:41,803
- What is it, then?
- It's your lack of faith.

1177
01:25:41,884 --> 01:25:44,491
Lack of faith?
Faith in what?

1178
01:25:44,569 --> 01:25:46,217
In yourself.

1179
01:25:46,295 --> 01:25:48,783
No, I have faith in myself.

1180
01:25:50,170 --> 01:25:53,650
Gerry Conlon, lifer,
30-year sentence.

1181
01:25:53,852 --> 01:25:55,838
And I knowhowto survive it.

1182
01:25:57,267 --> 01:25:58,641
At what price?

1183
01:25:58,724 --> 01:26:00,983
I'll pay the fucking price.
Don't you worry about it.

1184
01:26:01,064 --> 01:26:03,672
The price for what?

1185
01:26:05,361 --> 01:26:08,732
You're very good at the English,
aren't you?

1186
01:26:08,813 --> 01:26:11,421
You see, I don't understand
your language.

1187
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:16,869
"Justice." "Mercy." "Clemency."

1188
01:26:16,869 --> 01:26:20,350
I literally don't understand
what those words mean.

1189
01:26:20,437 --> 01:26:23,350
I'd like to put in an application
to get all my teeth extracted.

1190
01:26:23,583 --> 01:26:27,456
That way I could put my fist in my mouth
and never speak another word ofEnglish.

1191
01:26:27,534 --> 01:26:29,989
Do you see what I'm saying?
Mrs Peirce, is it?

1192
01:26:30,066 --> 01:26:32,597
Are you trying to impress me?

1193
01:26:34,362 --> 01:26:35,704
Visit's up.

1194
01:26:35,782 --> 01:26:38,619
Don't give my father
false hope, all right?

1195
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,905
You've got to help him!

1196
01:26:46,101 --> 01:26:49,090
In prison, you pray for anything
to break the monotony.

1197
01:26:49,170 --> 01:26:51,930
A snowstorm is like
a present from God.

1198
01:27:01,944 --> 01:27:03,668
Prison officers are not to be hit!

1199
01:27:04,553 --> 01:27:06,156
You've asked for it.

1200
01:27:06,241 --> 01:27:07,964
Come along!

1201
01:27:08,044 --> 01:27:11,524
After the riot, my father's
health deteriorated badly.

1202
01:27:11,573 --> 01:27:14,868
He couldn't make it down
the stairs to enjoy the snow.

1203
01:27:14,949 --> 01:27:18,429
I waved up to him, but he
was looking at something else.

1204
01:27:27,570 --> 01:27:30,407
My da always sawthe good
in people.

1205
01:27:30,485 --> 01:27:33,889
He recognized it in you
the minute he sawyou, Gareth.

1206
01:27:33,976 --> 01:27:38,112
Guv, guv, where you going?
Where's me letters? Guv'nor!

1207
01:27:41,418 --> 01:27:42,945
Thank you.

1208
01:27:47,288 --> 01:27:49,895
I see you've been mentioned
in Congress, Giuseppe.

1209
01:27:49,973 --> 01:27:51,347
What's that?

1210
01:27:57,339 --> 01:27:59,171
How'd you come by that name?

1211
01:28:01,021 --> 01:28:02,745
An Italian ice cream maker.

1212
01:28:02,824 --> 01:28:05,814
Had a shop on the corner
ofthe street where I was born.

1213
01:28:05,893 --> 01:28:07,923
Giuseppe Fusco.

1214
01:28:08,118 --> 01:28:10,452
My mother fell in love
with the name.

1215
01:28:10,535 --> 01:28:11,953
Were they...

1216
01:28:13,450 --> 01:28:14,901
- You know.
- What?

1217
01:28:16,097 --> 01:28:17,898
- Lovers.
- Who?

1218
01:28:17,977 --> 01:28:19,701
My mother and the ice cream maker?

1219
01:28:20,701 --> 01:28:22,228
Oh, no, God.

1220
01:28:22,312 --> 01:28:24,417
Jesus, no.
No, they were not.

1221
01:28:26,378 --> 01:28:28,331
No, shejust liked the name.

1222
01:28:28,411 --> 01:28:31,478
But it made my life hell.

1223
01:28:31,557 --> 01:28:35,431
All the other children laughing at you.
You have any kids yourself?

1224
01:28:39,805 --> 01:28:41,027
He's talking to Barker.

1225
01:28:41,109 --> 01:28:44,360
Forget it. He can talk
to whoever he fucking likes.

1226
01:28:47,017 --> 01:28:48,435
Two.

1227
01:28:49,779 --> 01:28:51,884
Flown the nest now.

1228
01:29:07,924 --> 01:29:09,800
Whether Barker was
responsible or not...

1229
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:12,870
for bringing in the riot squad,
Joe never forgave him.

1230
01:29:14,407 --> 01:29:16,360
Joe was still at war...

1231
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:18,775
and to him,
Barker was the enemy.

1232
01:29:20,660 --> 01:29:22,078
Number?

1233
01:29:22,156 --> 01:29:23,880
The name is McAndrew.

1234
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:27,830
Get out.
Get out ofthe light!

1235
01:29:29,637 --> 01:29:31,131
- Get out ofthe light.
- Number?

1236
01:29:31,209 --> 01:29:32,857
Name's Gerry Conlon.

1237
01:29:34,509 --> 01:29:36,964
Piss off out ofthe light.
Get out ofthe light!

1238
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:38,796
You're 136.

1239
01:29:44,176 --> 01:29:45,703
There's someone sitting there.

1240
01:29:48,511 --> 01:29:50,191
Move when you're told.

1241
01:29:56,567 --> 01:29:58,018
Put it out.

1242
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:29,207
- How's your boy?
- He's good.

1243
01:30:29,289 --> 01:30:32,049
You know, he looks
more like you every day.

1244
01:30:32,128 --> 01:30:34,659
He's smarter than I am.

1245
01:30:34,851 --> 01:30:36,770
Three years old,
he can read the funny papers.

1246
01:30:36,770 --> 01:30:38,688
There's a hair
in the fucking projector!

1247
01:30:38,688 --> 01:30:41,862
Yeah, get the fucking hair
out the projector, will you?

1248
01:30:42,984 --> 01:30:45,777
- Come on. Get it out!
- Get it out!

1249
01:30:47,933 --> 01:30:49,656
We're going fucking blind up here.

1250
01:30:49,736 --> 01:30:51,154
Lively.

1251
01:30:57,331 --> 01:30:58,935
- We'll get there, Pop.
- Quiet.

1252
01:30:59,019 --> 01:31:00,819
- I didn't say a fucking thing.
- You're blocking.

1253
01:31:00,899 --> 01:31:03,038
Shut it.

1254
01:31:04,735 --> 01:31:07,026
Now, listen.
Whoever comes to you...

1255
01:31:07,114 --> 01:31:08,640
with this Barzini meeting...

1256
01:31:13,942 --> 01:31:18,350
I knewthat Santino was gonna
have to go through all this.

1257
01:31:18,430 --> 01:31:20,154
And Fredo, well...

1258
01:31:21,844 --> 01:31:23,492
Fredo was wrong.

1259
01:31:25,834 --> 01:31:28,627
And I never wanted this for you.

1260
01:31:31,895 --> 01:31:32,539
For you!

1261
01:31:45,897 --> 01:31:47,850
To the floor, mate! Get down!

1262
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:58,397
Come on, mate, get a blanket!
For God's sake, he's burning!

1263
01:31:59,247 --> 01:32:01,658
Barker! Move back, Barker!

1264
01:32:01,741 --> 01:32:03,235
Get in there!

1265
01:32:04,618 --> 01:32:06,527
Get it out!

1266
01:32:27,174 --> 01:32:29,738
- Stretcher!
- Let's check it out.

1267
01:32:29,936 --> 01:32:31,660
All right, mate.
You're with us.

1268
01:32:31,854 --> 01:32:33,273
All right. Stretcher!

1269
01:32:34,808 --> 01:32:36,073
Gently.

1270
01:32:36,151 --> 01:32:37,602
All right, up!

1271
01:32:38,721 --> 01:32:41,514
That was a good day's work,
McAndrew.

1272
01:32:41,598 --> 01:32:43,017
That was a good day's work.

1273
01:32:43,094 --> 01:32:45,429
Get away from me.

1274
01:32:45,511 --> 01:32:47,770
Will you not look me in the eye
when I'm speaking to you?

1275
01:32:50,306 --> 01:32:53,907
I knowhowto look at people
without blinking as well.

1276
01:32:57,288 --> 01:32:59,699
In all my godforsaken life,
I've never known...

1277
01:32:59,782 --> 01:33:02,880
what it was like to want
to kill somebody until now.

1278
01:33:05,191 --> 01:33:08,060
You're a brave man, Joe,
a brave man.

1279
01:33:10,792 --> 01:33:13,093
Gerard Conlon, back on the threes.

1280
01:33:13,093 --> 01:33:16,497
- Stand your ground.
- Hawkins, returning to his cell.

1281
01:33:16,584 --> 01:33:19,268
Benjamin Bailey, back to him cell!

1282
01:33:19,346 --> 01:33:21,331
Burns, returning to his cell.

1283
01:33:21,418 --> 01:33:24,210
7445, Casey, back to his cell.

1284
01:33:24,295 --> 01:33:26,750
6309,Johnston, level three.

1285
01:33:26,827 --> 01:33:29,510
Regis, 113,
going up to number two.

1286
01:33:46,314 --> 01:33:48,802
- Back to your cell now!
- Keep moving.

1287
01:33:49,767 --> 01:33:51,600
Barker was maimed for life...

1288
01:33:51,685 --> 01:33:54,052
and Joe was sent
to another prison.

1289
01:33:54,140 --> 01:33:55,973
He's in solitary confinement
somewhere.

1290
01:33:56,058 --> 01:33:58,469
We've had no news ofhim
since then.

1291
01:33:58,552 --> 01:34:00,690
The new chief screw
had the yard painted...

1292
01:34:00,777 --> 01:34:02,609
and I was back
walking in circles again.

1293
01:34:02,695 --> 01:34:04,298
Back to the cells.

1294
01:34:06,876 --> 01:34:09,091
Come on. Move.

1295
01:34:35,571 --> 01:34:38,440
I'd like to help you out
with the campaign, Da...

1296
01:34:39,599 --> 01:34:42,391
ifthat's all right with you.

1297
01:34:42,476 --> 01:34:44,003
Do you mean it?

1298
01:34:44,202 --> 01:34:45,576
Aye.

1299
01:34:46,465 --> 01:34:48,221
That's great.

1300
01:34:48,307 --> 01:34:51,635
What I need from you is
the whole story, your whole story...

1301
01:34:51,874 --> 01:34:54,241
in as much detail
as you can remember.

1302
01:34:54,330 --> 01:34:57,777
And I need you to write it down.
It's really important.

1303
01:35:03,882 --> 01:35:05,605
I can't do this.

1304
01:35:07,411 --> 01:35:09,363
I can't write this, Da.

1305
01:35:09,444 --> 01:35:11,735
Could your son
not give you a hand?

1306
01:35:11,822 --> 01:35:14,430
He's up in his cell writing away.

1307
01:35:25,901 --> 01:35:27,734
Tape recorder.

1308
01:35:27,819 --> 01:35:29,619
You're a good talker.

1309
01:35:29,699 --> 01:35:31,193
Talk.

1310
01:35:32,730 --> 01:35:34,605
The strange thing is...

1311
01:35:35,645 --> 01:35:37,908
the strange thing is sometimes
I think he's a littlejealous...

1312
01:35:37,908 --> 01:35:40,396
of me taking over the campaign
and that there.

1313
01:35:40,479 --> 01:35:43,468
Going up and down the stairs
to meet you.

1314
01:35:43,663 --> 01:35:45,648
That's something
I never thought about Giuseppe:

1315
01:35:45,734 --> 01:35:47,490
That he could bejealous.

1316
01:35:50,376 --> 01:35:54,212
Anyhow, the main thing is
to get the case reopened...

1317
01:35:54,212 --> 01:35:57,737
because I don't knowhowlong
he can survive in here.

1318
01:36:13,853 --> 01:36:17,650
- I'm tired ofthis.
- Come on. We have to do this.

1319
01:36:17,728 --> 01:36:19,179
You behave yourself.

1320
01:36:22,676 --> 01:36:24,400
Get your head down.

1321
01:36:31,385 --> 01:36:34,483
When I was a wee lad, I used to wonder
what you were doing under the towel.

1322
01:36:34,569 --> 01:36:37,864
One day when you and Ma were out,
I got a big bowl ofboiling water...

1323
01:36:37,944 --> 01:36:41,205
whacked a big drop of Vick
and put the towel over my head.

1324
01:36:41,205 --> 01:36:44,730
I sat there trying to figure out what it
was about 'cause nothing was happening.

1325
01:36:44,811 --> 01:36:46,644
I figured you
must've been drinking it.

1326
01:36:46,729 --> 01:36:48,562
So I stuck my tongue in it.
Do you remember that?

1327
01:36:52,138 --> 01:36:54,014
How could I forget?

1328
01:36:54,823 --> 01:36:57,584
And your tongue
swelled up like a football.

1329
01:36:58,621 --> 01:37:00,651
Had to rush you to the hospital.

1330
01:37:00,731 --> 01:37:02,793
First time you'd stopped
talking in your life.

1331
01:37:06,255 --> 01:37:07,630
Give us that.

1332
01:37:08,710 --> 01:37:11,077
I'll do your chest for you, Da.

1333
01:37:17,994 --> 01:37:19,870
Was I always bad, was I?

1334
01:37:21,101 --> 01:37:22,476
Not always.

1335
01:37:22,559 --> 01:37:25,319
I don't deserve to spend
the rest of my life in here, do I?

1336
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:28,647
All they've done
is block out the light.

1337
01:37:28,735 --> 01:37:30,568
They can't block out
the light in here.

1338
01:37:30,653 --> 01:37:32,377
Listen.

1339
01:37:32,456 --> 01:37:34,027
Every night...

1340
01:37:34,106 --> 01:37:36,440
I take your mother's
hand in mine.

1341
01:37:36,523 --> 01:37:40,429
We go out the front door,
into Cyprus Street...

1342
01:37:40,666 --> 01:37:43,688
down to Falls Road,
up the Antrim Road...

1343
01:37:45,116 --> 01:37:47,025
to Cave Hill.

1344
01:37:47,110 --> 01:37:48,681
We look back down...

1345
01:37:50,985 --> 01:37:52,938
on poor, troubled Belfast.

1346
01:37:56,202 --> 01:37:58,887
I've been doing that every night...

1347
01:37:58,887 --> 01:38:00,611
for five years now.

1348
01:38:02,724 --> 01:38:04,709
As ifl never left your mother.

1349
01:38:14,232 --> 01:38:16,687
What I remember most
about my childhood is...

1350
01:38:16,764 --> 01:38:18,673
holding your hand.

1351
01:38:18,759 --> 01:38:21,214
My wee hand in your big hand.

1352
01:38:21,291 --> 01:38:23,822
And the smell oftobacco.
I remember that...

1353
01:38:23,822 --> 01:38:26,889
I could smell the tobacco
offthe palm of your hand.

1354
01:38:30,152 --> 01:38:33,829
When I want to feel happy, I try
to remember the smell oftobacco.

1355
01:38:37,402 --> 01:38:38,929
Hold my hand.

1356
01:38:39,167 --> 01:38:40,891
Get the fuck...

1357
01:38:42,044 --> 01:38:44,029
Don't go sentimental on me now.

1358
01:38:45,382 --> 01:38:48,982
Don't be upset, Da. Look,
I'll hold your hand if you like.

1359
01:38:51,443 --> 01:38:53,123
I'm going to die.

1360
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:56,153
Don't be saying that.

1361
01:38:57,044 --> 01:38:58,418
I'm scared.

1362
01:39:00,496 --> 01:39:02,406
You've no reason to be scared.

1363
01:39:02,491 --> 01:39:06,975
Don't you be comforting me when I can
see the truth staring me in the face.

1364
01:39:07,056 --> 01:39:10,581
I'm scared I'm gonna die here
among strangers.

1365
01:39:10,815 --> 01:39:12,080
You're not fucking dying.

1366
01:39:12,158 --> 01:39:15,683
Can I not say a thing
without you fucking contradicting me?

1367
01:39:17,030 --> 01:39:21,973
I'm scared to leave
your mother behind.

1368
01:39:23,897 --> 01:39:27,115
Look, you are not going to die,
all right, Da?

1369
01:39:29,229 --> 01:39:32,677
Even if you do, sure I can
look after Ma all right.

1370
01:39:32,873 --> 01:39:35,820
You think I'd leave
Sarah in your care?

1371
01:39:37,285 --> 01:39:38,889
What do you mean?

1372
01:39:38,973 --> 01:39:42,770
You haven't the maturity to take care
of yourself, let alone your mother.

1373
01:39:49,522 --> 01:39:52,054
I haven't much time between
appointments, Mrs Peirce.

1374
01:39:52,054 --> 01:39:54,159
- How can I help you?
- Thank you.

1375
01:39:54,241 --> 01:39:57,808
I'm the solicitor for the Conlons,
Chieflnspector.

1376
01:39:57,808 --> 01:40:01,409
Giuseppe Conlon is critically ill,
as you may know.

1377
01:40:01,645 --> 01:40:03,783
I've petitioned before the court
for his compassionate parole.

1378
01:40:03,870 --> 01:40:05,473
They want your clearance.

1379
01:40:06,517 --> 01:40:08,358
That'll be difficult, Mrs Peirce.

1380
01:40:08,358 --> 01:40:11,609
These people have committed
horrific crimes.

1381
01:40:11,695 --> 01:40:13,910
Society demands
that they serve their time.

1382
01:40:15,071 --> 01:40:17,286
But they didn't do it,
Chieflnspector.

1383
01:40:17,373 --> 01:40:18,907
Says who?

1384
01:40:18,907 --> 01:40:21,122
Say the real bombers.

1385
01:40:21,209 --> 01:40:23,740
They told you they did it,
Mr Dixon.

1386
01:40:23,818 --> 01:40:26,273
Gerry Conlon told me he did it,
Mrs Peirce.

1387
01:40:26,350 --> 01:40:28,837
These people are liars.

1388
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:31,375
They're liars for a cause.
That's the worst kind.

1389
01:40:31,413 --> 01:40:33,552
But he's dying.
Giuseppe's dying.

1390
01:40:33,638 --> 01:40:36,551
A lot of people are dying.
It's a dirty war.

1391
01:40:40,965 --> 01:40:42,883
Well, I'll see what I can do.

1392
01:40:42,883 --> 01:40:44,836
Is this your family, Mr Dixon?

1393
01:40:45,991 --> 01:40:47,867
That's my wife and my son.

1394
01:40:47,947 --> 01:40:50,281
You have another appointment.

1395
01:40:50,364 --> 01:40:51,629
Yes.

1396
01:40:52,934 --> 01:40:55,880
I'll see you again, Mr Dixon.

1397
01:41:30,413 --> 01:41:32,214
Are you all right, Da?

1398
01:41:45,259 --> 01:41:47,365
Are you all right?

1399
01:41:50,055 --> 01:41:51,429
Wake up, Da.

1400
01:41:52,433 --> 01:41:55,575
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Giuseppe?

1401
01:41:56,730 --> 01:41:58,453
Come on, dear God in heaven,
don't do this to me.

1402
01:41:58,648 --> 01:41:59,869
Come on. Wake up.

1403
01:41:59,952 --> 01:42:02,091
Wake up! Fuck's sake, come on!

1404
01:42:02,177 --> 01:42:05,581
There you go. Thank you.
You're all right, Da.

1405
01:42:05,668 --> 01:42:07,544
I'm going to get some help.

1406
01:42:07,624 --> 01:42:10,156
Number 73! Number 73!

1407
01:42:10,156 --> 01:42:12,611
Please come quickly!
My father's sick!

1408
01:42:12,688 --> 01:42:14,215
Benbay, Giuseppe's taken bad!

1409
01:42:14,299 --> 01:42:15,910
Put your arms around me.

1410
01:42:15,910 --> 01:42:18,900
I'm getting you out ofbed.
Put your arms around me.

1411
01:42:21,665 --> 01:42:24,196
- Open the fucking door!
- He's number 73!

1412
01:42:24,273 --> 01:42:25,953
- Open the fucking door!
- Giuseppe!

1413
01:42:27,112 --> 01:42:29,676
Fuck, he can't breathe.
He can't fucking breathe!

1414
01:42:30,488 --> 01:42:33,816
He can't breathe!
Look, my father's fucking dying!

1415
01:42:33,902 --> 01:42:36,771
- He needs oxygen!
- Give him a fucking break!

1416
01:42:37,009 --> 01:42:39,617
Open the fucking gate!
I'm right here, Da.

1417
01:42:39,695 --> 01:42:41,527
Get him in here!

1418
01:42:41,613 --> 01:42:43,904
What the fuck is going on?

1419
01:42:48,134 --> 01:42:49,661
Hammersmith Hospital now.

1420
01:42:49,745 --> 01:42:51,426
I want to go with him.

1421
01:42:52,622 --> 01:42:55,612
I've got to get clearance first.
It's out of my hands.

1422
01:42:55,691 --> 01:42:57,797
You're gonna be all right, Da!

1423
01:42:57,878 --> 01:43:00,977
- I'll be with you as soon as I can.
- Take him back to his cell.

1424
01:43:06,318 --> 01:43:10,576
Leave him alone, you bastards!
Just let him be!

1425
01:43:10,576 --> 01:43:13,453
Stay strong, Gerry!
Stay strong, mate!

1426
01:43:13,453 --> 01:43:15,371
Keep your chin up, mate!

1427
01:43:15,371 --> 01:43:17,019
We're with you, Gerry!

1428
01:43:17,097 --> 01:43:19,202
We're with you all the way, mate!

1429
01:43:31,751 --> 01:43:33,278
He's still awake.

1430
01:43:47,595 --> 01:43:49,886
Your father passed away
an hour ago.

1431
01:43:50,932 --> 01:43:52,459
Thank you very much.

1432
01:43:54,883 --> 01:43:56,607
I'm sorry.

1433
01:44:26,762 --> 01:44:28,671
Giuseppe is dead, man!

1434
01:44:29,601 --> 01:44:31,586
They kill Giuseppe!

1435
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:38,494
Gerry, man!

1436
01:44:43,334 --> 01:44:45,058
They killed Giuseppe!

1437
01:45:31,670 --> 01:45:34,430
Well, I think they ought to take
the word "compassion"...

1438
01:45:34,470 --> 01:45:36,346
out ofthe English dictionary.

1439
01:45:39,304 --> 01:45:41,289
They fouled the ball, Gareth.

1440
01:45:44,137 --> 01:45:47,662
They fouled the fucking ball,
and they're as guilty as sin.

1441
01:45:48,817 --> 01:45:51,687
Believe me, ifthere's one thing
I knowabout, it's guilt.

1442
01:45:52,999 --> 01:45:56,523
Keep looking 'em in the eye,
and it's gonna reveal itself.

1443
01:45:56,605 --> 01:45:58,590
You have to keep up the pressure.

1444
01:46:01,515 --> 01:46:03,391
Do what you have to do.

1445
01:46:05,390 --> 01:46:07,997
Free the Four!
Free the Four!

1446
01:46:26,335 --> 01:46:28,899
Those were meant to be here
three weeks ago.

1447
01:46:31,974 --> 01:46:35,270
"The Parade oflnnocence."
What do you think?

1448
01:46:35,350 --> 01:46:37,729
Thousands of people
lined the streets ofDublin...

1449
01:46:37,729 --> 01:46:39,255
London and Liverpool today
in demonstrations...

1450
01:46:39,340 --> 01:46:41,292
demanding the release
ofthe Guildford Four.

1451
01:46:41,373 --> 01:46:44,442
- Questions have been raised...
- Say good night to Daddy.

1452
01:46:44,442 --> 01:46:46,776
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night, son.

1453
01:46:46,859 --> 01:46:48,615
Free the Four!
Free the Four!

1454
01:47:01,052 --> 01:47:03,005
This was a mistake.

1455
01:47:03,930 --> 01:47:06,111
Why don't we let her
see the files?

1456
01:47:06,193 --> 01:47:08,407
What harm could it do?

1457
01:47:08,456 --> 01:47:10,944
- Mr Dixon!
- Yes?

1458
01:47:11,026 --> 01:47:12,859
Don't you get tired ofthis?

1459
01:47:12,945 --> 01:47:15,585
This is a court order that I be allowed
to see the Giuseppe Conlon case files.

1460
01:47:19,274 --> 01:47:21,914
- Good morning.
- There are a fewrules to be observed.

1461
01:47:23,571 --> 01:47:25,785
Here's a complete list of
the Conlon, Giuseppe case files...

1462
01:47:25,872 --> 01:47:27,705
the only files you'll need to see.

1463
01:47:27,791 --> 01:47:29,929
I'll go to the file drawer
and bring it out.

1464
01:47:30,015 --> 01:47:32,623
You take a page at a time,
read it and then return it.

1465
01:47:32,701 --> 01:47:35,384
Sorry. Is there a problem,
Mr Dixon?

1466
01:47:35,463 --> 01:47:37,263
Problem?
Not at all, Mrs Peirce.

1467
01:47:37,343 --> 01:47:40,670
Our chief archivist, Mr Jenkins,
is here to assist you.

1468
01:47:41,639 --> 01:47:43,973
If you want to make a photocopy,
I alone will do it.

1469
01:47:44,056 --> 01:47:46,773
Use this pen at all times
for any notes.

1470
01:47:46,856 --> 01:47:50,260
If you deface any document, we can
trace it through the ink in this pen.

1471
01:47:50,347 --> 01:47:54,755
There are national security issues
involved here, Mrs Peirce.

1472
01:47:54,835 --> 01:47:56,711
We wouldn't want
police intelligence files...

1473
01:47:56,792 --> 01:47:59,891
leaked to the IRA now, would we?

1474
01:48:02,431 --> 01:48:04,154
Conlon, Giuseppe file.

1475
01:48:04,234 --> 01:48:06,067
Yes, sir.

1476
01:48:18,428 --> 01:48:20,795
Leave my kit on the bus,
'cause I'm not staying in yourjail.

1477
01:48:20,883 --> 01:48:24,407
So, our new VIP prisoner.

1478
01:48:24,489 --> 01:48:25,831
Welcome to Scotland.

1479
01:48:25,908 --> 01:48:28,013
I'm an innocent man.
My father was an innocent man.

1480
01:48:28,057 --> 01:48:32,039
He died in one of yourjails.
There's nothing you can do to hurt me.

1481
01:48:32,123 --> 01:48:33,956
They've moved me to a Scottish
jail to break my confidence.

1482
01:48:34,041 --> 01:48:37,292
- Put him in solitary.
- This is a peaceful protest.

1483
01:48:37,379 --> 01:48:38,873
We'll teach you manners.

1484
01:48:38,951 --> 01:48:40,632
Better men than you
have tried that already.

1485
01:48:40,716 --> 01:48:43,127
I have not seen my client
for two months.

1486
01:48:43,363 --> 01:48:46,691
He's been moved to Scotland, which has
impeded my investigation into his case.

1487
01:48:46,777 --> 01:48:50,302
So I'm filing this motion
to gain proper access...

1488
01:48:50,383 --> 01:48:51,987
Free the Four!

1489
01:49:07,147 --> 01:49:08,795
Here, thanks a lot.
Good day.

1490
01:49:08,873 --> 01:49:10,444
Thanks, thanks, thanks.

1491
01:49:27,479 --> 01:49:30,577
Sorry. Could you copy that
for me, please?

1492
01:49:31,507 --> 01:49:33,569
Thank you.

1493
01:49:42,632 --> 01:49:45,469
I just want my mother to be happy.

1494
01:49:46,813 --> 01:49:49,835
I'd like her to know...

1495
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:53,445
that Giuseppe talked about her
every day ofhis life.

1496
01:49:55,828 --> 01:49:57,704
He missed her terribly.

1497
01:50:02,426 --> 01:50:05,219
It's strange to be in a cell
without him.

1498
01:50:07,759 --> 01:50:10,246
I can't seem to get his face
out of my mind.

1499
01:50:10,329 --> 01:50:12,161
Everywhere I look, I see him.

1500
01:50:19,267 --> 01:50:23,216
Strange what time does
when you're in prison.

1501
01:50:25,367 --> 01:50:29,043
Like, you can be staring
at the wall.

1502
01:50:29,126 --> 01:50:31,460
Drip, drip, drip.

1503
01:50:33,691 --> 01:50:35,033
It takes an eternity.

1504
01:50:35,110 --> 01:50:38,252
And then you blink,
and three years have gone by.

1505
01:50:43,051 --> 01:50:45,161
I mean, what I'm trying to...

1506
01:50:45,161 --> 01:50:48,074
I don't knowwhat the fuck
I'm trying to say.

1507
01:50:50,378 --> 01:50:53,215
But I can't forget
what they did to my family.

1508
01:50:54,905 --> 01:50:56,356
I just can't forget.

1509
01:51:43,394 --> 01:51:44,692
Morning.

1510
01:51:45,926 --> 01:51:48,457
- Where's Jenkins?
- He telephoned in sick.

1511
01:51:48,496 --> 01:51:50,711
I'm afraid you're going
to have to come back tomorrow.

1512
01:51:50,798 --> 01:51:53,438
I can't. I'm in court tomorrow.
There's too much to get through.

1513
01:51:53,522 --> 01:51:54,940
I can't help you.

1514
01:51:55,171 --> 01:51:56,851
Please. I've got the court order.

1515
01:51:57,089 --> 01:51:59,228
You sawwhat Mr Jenkins did.
Hejust brings me the files.

1516
01:51:59,314 --> 01:52:01,681
I take the notes and give them
back to you. Please.

1517
01:52:01,884 --> 01:52:04,372
- What name is it?
- Conlon.

1518
01:52:04,455 --> 01:52:07,367
- All right.
- Thanks. Thank you very much. Cheers.

1519
01:52:13,048 --> 01:52:14,695
What name was that again?

1520
01:52:16,308 --> 01:52:18,370
We've got two Conlon boxes.

1521
01:52:18,457 --> 01:52:22,057
Is it Giuseppe Conlon
or Gerard Conlon?

1522
01:52:24,019 --> 01:52:25,393
Gerard.

1523
01:52:32,574 --> 01:52:34,483
Well, that's for starters.

1524
01:52:55,591 --> 01:52:56,813
Fuck 'em!

1525
01:52:59,465 --> 01:53:00,840
It's good news.

1526
01:53:01,959 --> 01:53:05,177
We're talking about
a piece of evidence...

1527
01:53:05,258 --> 01:53:08,509
that says they knewall along,
that they let my father die in prison?

1528
01:53:08,595 --> 01:53:11,432
Would you mind telling me
what's good about that?

1529
01:53:11,511 --> 01:53:13,344
We'll get them in court.

1530
01:53:13,429 --> 01:53:16,146
"We'll get them in court"?
Will you catch yourself on?

1531
01:53:16,229 --> 01:53:19,175
They've kept us in prison for 15 years.
They can keep us in for another 15.

1532
01:53:19,260 --> 01:53:21,093
This is the fucking
government, Gareth!

1533
01:53:21,178 --> 01:53:24,091
It's the fucking government!
What are they gonna say?

1534
01:53:24,170 --> 01:53:26,275
"We're sorry about that"?

1535
01:53:27,393 --> 01:53:30,229
"Made a wee bit of a mistake,
but you can be on your way now"?

1536
01:53:30,308 --> 01:53:32,370
What are they gonna say?
"Sorry we killed your da"?

1537
01:53:32,456 --> 01:53:35,249
"Sorry we fucked
your fucking life to hell"?

1538
01:53:51,982 --> 01:53:54,819
I am not putting my mother
through hell again.

1539
01:53:55,818 --> 01:53:57,499
Are you afraid of court?

1540
01:53:57,583 --> 01:53:59,842
I just don't wanna be
humiliated again.

1541
01:54:20,101 --> 01:54:21,596
I swear by Almighty God...

1542
01:54:21,674 --> 01:54:24,925
that the evidence I shall give
shall be the truth, the whole truth...

1543
01:54:25,012 --> 01:54:26,888
and nothing but the truth.

1544
01:54:33,643 --> 01:54:37,822
Mr Dixon, do you know
these young people...

1545
01:54:37,901 --> 01:54:40,160
known as the Guildford Four?

1546
01:54:42,696 --> 01:54:44,038
Yes, I do.

1547
01:54:44,116 --> 01:54:47,105
Do you knowhowlong
they have spent in jail?

1548
01:54:48,105 --> 01:54:49,447
Fifteen years.

1549
01:54:52,095 --> 01:54:53,775
Do you know Annie Maguire...

1550
01:54:54,704 --> 01:54:57,770
who served her 14 years
without remission?

1551
01:54:58,770 --> 01:55:01,487
Do you knowher son Vincent
who served five years?

1552
01:55:01,570 --> 01:55:04,211
Her son Patrick who served four?
Do you knowher husband...

1553
01:55:04,294 --> 01:55:07,131
Paddy Maguire, who served 12 years?

1554
01:55:08,169 --> 01:55:11,921
Carole Richardson was 17
when she went to jail, Mr Dixon.

1555
01:55:12,005 --> 01:55:13,761
Now she is 32.

1556
01:55:15,611 --> 01:55:17,529
Do you knowCarole Richardson?

1557
01:55:17,529 --> 01:55:21,632
- What is the point ofthis?
- Yes, come to the point.

1558
01:55:27,656 --> 01:55:30,952
Do you knowwho this is, Mr Dixon?

1559
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:36,323
No, I don't.

1560
01:55:36,403 --> 01:55:38,126
Well, then would you be so kind...

1561
01:55:38,206 --> 01:55:41,505
as to read this statement
that you took from him...

1562
01:55:41,505 --> 01:55:44,374
on the third ofNovember, 1974?

1563
01:55:44,459 --> 01:55:48,016
A statement, My Lord, which
vindicates all ofthese people...

1564
01:55:48,218 --> 01:55:50,901
- all these innocent people.
- I need to see a copy ofthis statement.

1565
01:55:51,095 --> 01:55:54,390
Either that man or his superior
or his superior's superior...

1566
01:55:54,471 --> 01:55:57,417
ordered that these people
be used as scapegoats...

1567
01:55:57,502 --> 01:56:00,491
by a nation
that was baying for blood...

1568
01:56:00,686 --> 01:56:03,326
in return for the innocent blood
spilled on the streets of Guildford!

1569
01:56:03,563 --> 01:56:06,440
- You got your blood, Mr Dixon!
- She is making a political speech.

1570
01:56:06,440 --> 01:56:09,843
You got the blood of Giuseppe Conlon
and the lifeblood of Carole Richardson!

1571
01:56:09,931 --> 01:56:12,920
You got 15 years ofblood and sweat
and pain from my client...

1572
01:56:13,153 --> 01:56:15,717
whose only crime
was that he was Irish...

1573
01:56:15,800 --> 01:56:18,331
and foolish, and he was in
the wrong place at the wrong time!

1574
01:56:18,409 --> 01:56:21,321
Mrs Peirce, I will have you
removed from the court.

1575
01:56:27,155 --> 01:56:29,643
And one of your colleagues,
My Lord...

1576
01:56:29,725 --> 01:56:32,672
who sat where you sit now said,
"It is a pity...

1577
01:56:32,756 --> 01:56:35,211
you were not charged
with treason to the Crown...

1578
01:56:35,211 --> 01:56:38,768
a charge that carries a penalty
of death by hanging...

1579
01:56:38,855 --> 01:56:41,954
a sentence I would have no difficulty
in passing in this case."

1580
01:56:42,039 --> 01:56:44,832
Mrs Peirce, I am trying
to read this document.

1581
01:56:44,917 --> 01:56:48,015
I will not tell you again
to be silent...

1582
01:56:48,101 --> 01:56:51,504
or you will be removed
from the court.

1583
01:57:31,795 --> 01:57:33,933
My Lord, this document...

1584
01:57:34,019 --> 01:57:37,041
brings the entire British
legal system into disrepute.

1585
01:57:37,127 --> 01:57:39,582
My Lord, this is new evidence.

1586
01:57:39,659 --> 01:57:41,611
It is shocking new evidence.

1587
01:57:41,692 --> 01:57:43,303
My Lord, this evidence...

1588
01:57:43,303 --> 01:57:46,369
was not submitted at the trial
that is under appeal.

1589
01:57:46,449 --> 01:57:50,006
That, I believe, is the point
Mrs Peirce is trying to make.

1590
01:57:50,055 --> 01:57:52,618
- Proceed, Mrs Peirce.
- My Lord, I demand a recess.

1591
01:57:52,702 --> 01:57:56,531
There will be no demands made
in my court.

1592
01:57:56,730 --> 01:57:57,995
Stand back.

1593
01:58:02,484 --> 01:58:04,939
This alibi for Gerry Conlon...

1594
01:58:05,016 --> 01:58:06,696
was taken by Mr Dixon...

1595
01:58:06,780 --> 01:58:09,879
one month after
Gerry Conlon was arrested.

1596
01:58:09,964 --> 01:58:13,992
This note was attached to it
when I found it in police files.

1597
01:58:13,992 --> 01:58:17,211
It reads, "Not to be shown
to the defence."

1598
01:58:22,931 --> 01:58:25,877
I have one question
to ask you, Mr Dixon:

1599
01:58:25,961 --> 01:58:28,023
Why was the alibi for Gerry Conlon...

1600
01:58:28,109 --> 01:58:32,212
who was charged with the murder
of five innocent people...

1601
01:58:32,291 --> 01:58:34,243
kept from the defence?

1602
01:58:41,804 --> 01:58:43,714
- Give us an answer!
- Answer the question!

1603
01:58:44,451 --> 01:58:46,284
Silence!

1604
01:58:46,370 --> 01:58:49,282
- It's about time!
- Order in the court!

1605
01:58:50,628 --> 01:58:53,311
My Lord, I would like
to approach the bench.

1606
01:58:53,351 --> 01:58:54,878
This is most irregular.

1607
01:58:54,963 --> 01:58:57,526
Yes. I am aware ofthat, My Lord.

1608
01:58:58,377 --> 01:59:00,177
Very well.

1609
01:59:14,987 --> 01:59:17,442
Mr Dixon, you may stand down.

1610
01:59:18,939 --> 01:59:22,113
This is the man
who should be under arrest!

1611
01:59:22,199 --> 01:59:24,304
Be silent, Mrs Peirce!

1612
01:59:24,386 --> 01:59:26,600
- This court is nowin recess.
- Guards, get ready.

1613
01:59:26,688 --> 01:59:28,979
Don't try and make me
the fall guy...

1614
01:59:29,066 --> 01:59:31,903
for the whole
British legal establishment.

1615
01:59:35,818 --> 01:59:37,803
Ifl accept this mercy deal...

1616
01:59:37,889 --> 01:59:39,722
They have a flipping cheek,
offering me mercy.

1617
01:59:39,807 --> 01:59:41,640
They should be begging
for mercy themselves.

1618
01:59:41,725 --> 01:59:43,329
- You ready, Mr Conlon?
- Aye.

1619
01:59:43,413 --> 01:59:45,399
I knowthe difference
between right and wrong.

1620
01:59:45,485 --> 01:59:47,978
The truth has to come out.
They may not want to hear it...

1621
01:59:47,978 --> 01:59:49,896
but there's people outside
who'll listen.

1622
01:59:49,896 --> 01:59:52,352
- Just think about it, will you?
- All right.

1623
01:59:52,428 --> 01:59:54,490
Aye. Give us three ofthem.

1624
02:00:09,576 --> 02:00:11,103
Silence!

1625
02:00:13,642 --> 02:00:16,173
In the matter ofHer Majesty...

1626
02:00:16,251 --> 02:00:18,934
versus Gerard Patrick Conlon...

1627
02:00:19,013 --> 02:00:21,806
the case is hereby dismissed.

1628
02:00:26,340 --> 02:00:28,445
My husband died in your prison
an innocent man!

1629
02:00:28,527 --> 02:00:31,701
I'm going out the front door.
I'll see you outside.

1630
02:00:31,787 --> 02:00:33,740
- This way.
- I'm going out the front door.

1631
02:00:33,820 --> 02:00:35,042
What about Giuseppe Conlon?

1632
02:00:35,125 --> 02:00:37,842
Your Honour,
he was an innocent man!

1633
02:00:40,419 --> 02:00:42,099
Mr Conlon, that's not a good idea.

1634
02:00:42,183 --> 02:00:43,864
Use the back,
for security reasons.

1635
02:00:43,948 --> 02:00:45,933
I'm a free man,
and I'm going out the front door.

1636
02:00:47,017 --> 02:00:50,388
In the matter of
Her Majesty versus Paul Hill...

1637
02:00:50,469 --> 02:00:53,950
the case is hereby dismissed.

1638
02:01:00,482 --> 02:01:04,508
Leave me alone!
I'm going out the front door with Gerry!

1639
02:01:06,735 --> 02:01:11,524
In the matter of
Her Majesty versus Patrick Armstrong...

1640
02:01:11,607 --> 02:01:13,516
the case is hereby dismissed.

1641
02:01:15,596 --> 02:01:20,037
In the matter of
Her Majesty versus Carole Richardson...

1642
02:01:20,085 --> 02:01:23,412
the case is hereby dismissed.

1643
02:01:23,499 --> 02:01:24,950
I'm an innocent man!

1644
02:01:25,033 --> 02:01:28,710
I spent 15 years in prison
for something I didn't do!

1645
02:01:28,793 --> 02:01:30,625
I watched my father die...

1646
02:01:30,711 --> 02:01:33,471
in a British prison
for something he didn't do!

1647
02:01:33,511 --> 02:01:36,348
And this government
still says he's guilty!

1648
02:01:36,427 --> 02:01:38,030
I want to tell them...

1649
02:01:38,268 --> 02:01:41,137
that until my father
is proved innocent...

1650
02:01:41,184 --> 02:01:45,090
until all the people involved
in this case are proved innocent...

1651
02:01:45,173 --> 02:01:47,584
until the guilty ones
are brought to justice...

1652
02:01:47,667 --> 02:01:49,777
I will fight on...

1653
02:01:49,777 --> 02:01:53,257
in the name of my father
and ofthe truth!
