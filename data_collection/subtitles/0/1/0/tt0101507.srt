1
00:00:03,391 --> 00:00:06,622
Them niggas around the corner
tripped out, man.

2
00:00:06,828 --> 00:00:09,956
-Fuck that shit, man
-Let's go. I'll take my car.

3
00:00:10,164 --> 00:00:13,395
Oh, fuck that. We should've
let these niggas have it.

4
00:00:13,634 --> 00:00:17,126
-Just pull up, just pull up.
-Get your shit ready, nigga.

5
00:00:17,338 --> 00:00:18,498
Damn

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,600
These niggas here?

7
00:00:20,842 --> 00:00:23,333
All right, hold up.
Get ready, get ready.

8
00:00:24,078 --> 00:00:25,272
Look out, niggal What's up, punk?

9
00:00:37,358 --> 00:00:40,020
Possible 187 at corner of
Crenshaw and Century.

10
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,161
They shot my brother

11
00:01:10,391 --> 00:01:12,791
-Tre, you do your homework?
-What homework?

12
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,051
-Yeah, I did it.
-Can I copy it?

13
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:18,162
Hell, no. Too bad,
you should've done it.

14
00:01:18,399 --> 00:01:22,495
-Did you hear the shooting last night?
-Yeah, I got under my bed.

15
00:01:22,737 --> 00:01:24,364
Man, you a scaredy-cat.

16
00:01:24,572 --> 00:01:27,837
My mama say, ''A bullet
don't have no name on it.''

17
00:01:28,042 --> 00:01:31,307
I ain't afraid. My brothers
been shot and they still alive.

18
00:01:31,512 --> 00:01:33,207
They lucky.

19
00:01:35,316 --> 00:01:36,874
Y'all want to see something?

20
00:01:37,652 --> 00:01:38,983
What?

21
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,586
I ain't saying what.
Want to see it or not?

22
00:02:30,605 --> 00:02:31,867
Is that blood?

23
00:02:32,073 --> 00:02:33,267
What happened?

24
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:37,136
Somebody got smoked. Look at
the hole in the wall, stupid.

25
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:40,438
Least I can tell my times tables.

26
00:02:40,715 --> 00:02:43,275
Look! Why is the blood
turning yellow?

27
00:02:43,551 --> 00:02:46,782
That's what happens when it
separates from the plasma.

28
00:02:47,054 --> 00:02:50,455
So that's how the settlers
survived that long hard winter...

29
00:02:50,725 --> 00:02:54,525
...that took so many of their lives,
is by eating foods...

30
00:02:54,729 --> 00:02:59,826
...that were given to them,
like the turkey and the squash...

31
00:03:00,334 --> 00:03:05,271
...and all the foods that we think of
as our traditional holiday meal.

32
00:03:05,506 --> 00:03:08,942
And that's why we celebrate
Thanksgiving...

33
00:03:09,176 --> 00:03:12,236
...to commemorate the unity
between the Indians...

34
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,147
...excuse me...

35
00:03:14,348 --> 00:03:16,407
...the Native Americans...

36
00:03:16,617 --> 00:03:21,350
...and the early English settlers
who were called.... Class?

37
00:03:21,622 --> 00:03:23,317
Pilgrims.

38
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:25,821
That's right, the pilgrims.
Very good.

39
00:03:26,027 --> 00:03:27,324
The penguins!

40
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,988
Who said that?

41
00:03:31,766 --> 00:03:34,530
-Mr. Styles.
-That's me.

42
00:03:34,802 --> 00:03:37,600
How is it you always have
something funny to say?

43
00:03:37,872 --> 00:03:39,533
Because I'm a comedian.

44
00:03:41,642 --> 00:03:44,133
Would you like to come up
and teach the class?

45
00:03:46,447 --> 00:03:47,505
Yeah, I can do that.

46
00:03:47,715 --> 00:03:50,377
Very well, come on up. Instruct us.

47
00:03:56,957 --> 00:04:00,324
-What's the basis of your lecture?
-What?

48
00:04:00,861 --> 00:04:03,022
What are you going to talk about?

49
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,457
I'd tell you if you let me talk.

50
00:04:09,804 --> 00:04:14,002
-What's the name of this place?
-That's Africa. I know that.

51
00:04:14,241 --> 00:04:15,674
Right, that's Africa.

52
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:19,710
Did you know that Africa is where
the body of the first man was found?

53
00:04:20,014 --> 00:04:22,744
My daddy says that's where
all people originated from.

54
00:04:23,017 --> 00:04:26,316
That means everybody's really
from Africa. Everybody.

55
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,750
All y'all. Everybody.

56
00:04:29,023 --> 00:04:32,083
I ain't from Africa.
I'm from Crenshaw Mafia!

57
00:04:35,429 --> 00:04:37,329
Like it or not, you from Africa.

58
00:04:37,531 --> 00:04:41,831
I ain't from Africa. You from Africa.
You African booty-scratcher!

59
00:04:43,037 --> 00:04:44,026
Quiet.

60
00:04:44,271 --> 00:04:45,932
Punk, I'll kick your ass.

61
00:04:46,173 --> 00:04:48,767
That's enough.
Count to 10 and be quiet.

62
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:50,738
I'll get my brother to shoot you!

63
00:04:51,112 --> 00:04:54,878
Get your brother, bitch!
I'll get my daddy. Least I got one.

64
00:04:55,116 --> 00:04:58,051
I ain't your bitch.
Ain't nobody's bitch, bitch!

65
00:04:58,252 --> 00:05:01,744
Are you listening to me?
Sit down, now! That's enough!

66
00:05:04,525 --> 00:05:09,622
As I said, he's highly intelligent.
He has an enormous vocabulary.

67
00:05:10,064 --> 00:05:11,759
It's just that....

68
00:05:12,066 --> 00:05:13,431
Yes, go on.

69
00:05:13,701 --> 00:05:16,864
It's just that he has
a very bad temper.

70
00:05:17,104 --> 00:05:21,564
It's extremely difficult for him
to interact with the other children.

71
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:25,301
Perhaps I could recommend therapy
or a child psychologist.

72
00:05:25,546 --> 00:05:28,106
No, thank you.
We can manage just fine.

73
00:05:28,315 --> 00:05:32,376
Is there some problem in the home?
Are you employed?

74
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,115
That's none of your business, but...

75
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:38,449
...I am employed, and I'm studying
for my master's degree.

76
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:42,595
-Then you are educated.
-Are we gonna talk about me or my son?

77
00:05:42,797 --> 00:05:44,458
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:48,761
Well, we'll be happy to see Tre
back in class on Tuesday.

79
00:05:49,003 --> 00:05:51,767
His suspension was only
for three days, you know.

80
00:05:51,972 --> 00:05:55,635
-No. You won't be seeing Tre again.
-And why is that, may I ask?

81
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:59,744
-Tre is going to live with his father.
-His father?.

82
00:06:00,014 --> 00:06:05,111
Yes, his father. Or did you think
we made babies by ourselves?

83
00:06:07,188 --> 00:06:10,954
-You tell her go jump in the lake?
-What was our agreement?

84
00:06:11,158 --> 00:06:13,490
What did we put down in writing?

85
00:06:17,798 --> 00:06:20,790
''I, Tre Styles,
being of sound mind and body...

86
00:06:21,001 --> 00:06:24,095
...agree not to get into any disputes,
physical or verbal...

87
00:06:24,305 --> 00:06:28,469
...for the rest of the school year.
If I do not conform to this...

88
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:33,840
...I will go to live with my father,
Mr. Furious Styles.''

89
00:06:34,181 --> 00:06:37,344
''Signed....''
Oh, now, who wrote this?

90
00:06:38,953 --> 00:06:41,649
''Tre Styles.''

91
00:06:44,191 --> 00:06:47,058
You have to work on your handwriting.

92
00:06:57,838 --> 00:07:02,468
Bean pies. World-famous bean pies.
Like a bean pie, mister?

93
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,810
I just don't want to
see you end up dead.

94
00:07:09,016 --> 00:07:10,506
Or in jail.

95
00:07:11,652 --> 00:07:15,213
A drunk, standing in front
of one of these liquor stores.

96
00:07:15,489 --> 00:07:16,581
Can you understand?

97
00:07:21,262 --> 00:07:23,560
Look at me. I'm serious.

98
00:07:25,232 --> 00:07:26,995
I love you.

99
00:07:27,334 --> 00:07:28,562
You're my only son.

100
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:04,601
How you doing?

101
00:08:04,872 --> 00:08:09,206
-I'm fine. How about yourself?
-I'm living. That's enough for me.

102
00:08:10,744 --> 00:08:13,770
Well, here he is.

103
00:08:18,552 --> 00:08:22,545
-What's the matter? You can't say hi?
-Hi, Daddy.

104
00:08:25,092 --> 00:08:27,151
Go ahead, talk to your friends.

105
00:08:35,235 --> 00:08:37,760
-What's up, Tre?
-What's up, Doughboy?

106
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,140
Well, there goes your son.

107
00:08:45,946 --> 00:08:47,971
You wanted him, you got him.

108
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,350
Why you trying to make this so easy?

109
00:08:53,854 --> 00:08:55,754
Well, it's like you told me:

110
00:08:57,157 --> 00:08:59,489
I can't teach him how to be a man.

111
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:02,424
That's your job.

112
00:09:04,932 --> 00:09:07,833
So it ain't no weekly thing
no more, huh?

113
00:09:08,035 --> 00:09:09,696
You staying for good?

114
00:09:10,371 --> 00:09:13,772
Chris, you know Tre, right?
Remember, we were playing ball?

115
00:09:14,008 --> 00:09:17,205
Yeah. You the one collect
all those comic books.

116
00:09:17,444 --> 00:09:19,105
You living here now?

117
00:09:22,316 --> 00:09:23,840
Thank you, Reva.

118
00:09:25,152 --> 00:09:26,619
Furious.

119
00:09:30,057 --> 00:09:33,458
-Take care of my baby.
-He is my baby too.

120
00:09:35,295 --> 00:09:36,660
You still collect comics?

121
00:09:38,298 --> 00:09:40,892
This fool got more comics
than a motherfucker.

122
00:09:41,869 --> 00:09:44,064
-Tre, come here.
-Watch my stuff.

123
00:09:47,841 --> 00:09:49,365
What up, Tre?

124
00:09:49,576 --> 00:09:51,168
What's up, Rick?

125
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,816
Well, it looks like you got
all your friends over here.

126
00:09:59,353 --> 00:10:01,378
When you coming to pick me up?

127
00:10:04,591 --> 00:10:05,649
Listen...

128
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,687
...this is just a temporary thing.

129
00:10:08,996 --> 00:10:12,864
When I graduate, I'll get a better
job, a better place to stay.

130
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,195
Maybe a house?

131
00:10:15,436 --> 00:10:19,429
Then you can come back, and things
will be better. Okay?

132
00:10:20,107 --> 00:10:21,404
Okay, Mom.

133
00:10:21,742 --> 00:10:24,540
Okay. Can I have a kiss?

134
00:10:27,347 --> 00:10:30,180
-Love you, love you.
-Me too. Bye, Mommy.

135
00:10:30,384 --> 00:10:33,842
-Doughboy, staying out of trouble?
-I ain't got no troubles.

136
00:10:34,088 --> 00:10:36,249
-You got some troubles?
-Lawn trouble.

137
00:10:36,457 --> 00:10:39,051
-Why don't y'all rake these leaves up?
-How much?

138
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:42,524
I'll give you $5
for the whole lawn.

139
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:45,857
Five dollars. Man, that ain't shit.

140
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,797
-I can make more doing nothing.
-Oh, yeah? Doing what?

141
00:10:50,237 --> 00:10:51,727
He work for his uncle.

142
00:10:51,972 --> 00:10:55,601
That's too bad. I guess I just
have to get my son to do it for me.

143
00:10:55,876 --> 00:10:57,036
Do what?

144
00:10:57,277 --> 00:10:59,973
Want you to rake up these leaves
off the lawn.

145
00:11:00,714 --> 00:11:04,980
Boy, don't look at me funny if I
ask you to do something. Take this.

146
00:11:07,287 --> 00:11:11,451
There's two trash bags right there
on the ground. See y'all later.

147
00:11:15,762 --> 00:11:19,220
Damn, your daddy mean.
He's worse than the bogeyman himself.

148
00:11:19,466 --> 00:11:23,368
Gotta do all these leaves.
Who he think you is, Kunta Kinte?

149
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:26,061
-Later, Tre.
-Later.

150
00:11:26,673 --> 00:11:30,302
What you mean, a bogeyman?
There ain't no such thing.

151
00:11:30,577 --> 00:11:32,602
-Yeah, there is.
-lf there is...

152
00:11:32,813 --> 00:11:35,247
...I'll bet you Hulk
could whip his ass.

153
00:11:37,518 --> 00:11:39,179
Yeah, later.

154
00:12:15,222 --> 00:12:16,780
Tre, I gotta lay down
the rules of the house.

155
00:12:17,024 --> 00:12:19,151
Same thing as weekends,
you remember?

156
00:12:22,563 --> 00:12:23,996
All right, what are they?

157
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:28,294
Clean the bathroom sink,
floor and tub.

158
00:12:28,702 --> 00:12:30,329
I gotta clean that tub?

159
00:12:30,737 --> 00:12:31,795
Yeah.

160
00:12:34,975 --> 00:12:38,001
Clean my room and water the lawn.

161
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:41,147
Dad, can I ask you something?

162
00:12:41,381 --> 00:12:43,849
What do you have to do around here?

163
00:12:48,755 --> 00:12:53,055
I don't have to do nothing around here
except for pay the bills...

164
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:57,424
...put food on the table and put
clothes on your back, you understand?

165
00:12:57,831 --> 00:13:00,095
Glad I don't have to pay no bills.

166
00:13:01,535 --> 00:13:04,902
You may think I'm being hard
on you right now, but I'm not.

167
00:13:05,205 --> 00:13:08,265
I'm trying to teach you
how to be responsible.

168
00:13:08,575 --> 00:13:13,239
Your friends across the street,
they don't have anybody to show them.

169
00:13:13,513 --> 00:13:15,777
You gonna see how they end up too.

170
00:13:20,854 --> 00:13:22,845
I'm glad you're here, Tre.

171
00:13:24,424 --> 00:13:26,187
You're a prince, you know that?

172
00:13:26,593 --> 00:13:28,527
Yeah. You're the prince...

173
00:13:29,129 --> 00:13:30,596
...I'm the king.

174
00:13:31,632 --> 00:13:35,534
Right now, the king says it's time
for the prince to go to bed.

175
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,204
So get yourself together.

176
00:13:38,472 --> 00:13:40,565
I'll see you in the morning, okay?

177
00:14:46,807 --> 00:14:47,933
Oh, shit!

178
00:15:25,312 --> 00:15:27,371
Somebody must've prayed for that fool.

179
00:15:27,647 --> 00:15:31,549
-I swear I aimed right for his head.
-Should've blew it off.

180
00:15:31,818 --> 00:15:33,046
Don't say that.

181
00:15:34,721 --> 00:15:36,313
Don't say that.

182
00:15:38,225 --> 00:15:40,693
It'd be contributing to killing
another brother.

183
00:15:47,734 --> 00:15:50,100
Man, where are these fools?

184
00:15:52,672 --> 00:15:55,539
We've been waiting out here
for almost an hour.

185
00:16:14,561 --> 00:16:18,429
-We got a call of a burglary here.
-That was about an hour ago.

186
00:16:18,632 --> 00:16:21,430
We didn't ask you that.

187
00:16:21,635 --> 00:16:23,125
Yeah, well, I told you.

188
00:16:23,437 --> 00:16:26,235
Besides, I don't like having
my son out in the cold.

189
00:16:26,873 --> 00:16:28,807
Just tell me what happened, sir.

190
00:16:29,042 --> 00:16:30,600
Somebody broke into the house.

191
00:16:30,877 --> 00:16:33,641
I fired at him with my piece,
and he ran away.

192
00:16:34,314 --> 00:16:38,444
-You didn't get him?
-lf I did, he'd be laid out here.

193
00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:41,480
-Is there anything missing?
-No.

194
00:16:41,755 --> 00:16:44,280
Good, no need to make out a report.

195
00:16:44,491 --> 00:16:47,790
--got a 415 on Florence
between Vermont and Normandie.

196
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,891
Too bad you didn't get him.

197
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:55,726
Be one less nigger out here
we have to worry about.

198
00:17:02,275 --> 00:17:04,266
Hey, little man, how you doing?

199
00:17:05,011 --> 00:17:07,479
Go on in the house, Tre. Go on.

200
00:17:11,985 --> 00:17:15,148
-Something wrong?
-Something wrong? Yeah.

201
00:17:17,424 --> 00:17:19,984
It's just too bad you
don't know what it is...

202
00:17:23,263 --> 00:17:24,525
...brother.

203
00:17:37,611 --> 00:17:39,044
Ice-cream man!

204
00:17:39,346 --> 00:17:40,836
Wait up!

205
00:17:54,194 --> 00:17:55,456
What's up?

206
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,694
You ain't shit.

207
00:18:01,902 --> 00:18:03,494
You just like your daddy.

208
00:18:03,737 --> 00:18:06,968
You don't do shit and you never
gonna amount to shit.

209
00:18:07,674 --> 00:18:11,235
All you ever do around here
is eat, sleep and shit.

210
00:18:11,511 --> 00:18:15,641
Look at this place. Way y'all act,
y'all must think I'm the maid.

211
00:18:15,849 --> 00:18:18,818
-Is that it? I gotta go.
-Hell, no, it ain't it!

212
00:18:19,052 --> 00:18:21,885
It ain't it till I say
it's it, damn it!

213
00:18:24,057 --> 00:18:25,524
Cigarette.

214
00:18:25,725 --> 00:18:30,662
Don't get smart with me, I'll knock
your ass in the middle of next week.

215
00:18:32,899 --> 00:18:36,835
Where you going, you little
fat fuck? You ain't got a job.

216
00:18:38,238 --> 00:18:40,433
Who's that little fucker on my porch?

217
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:51,173
Oh, you're Furious' little boy, huh?

218
00:18:51,418 --> 00:18:55,514
Boy, you look more and more
like your daddy every day.

219
00:18:55,722 --> 00:18:56,916
So tell me something.

220
00:18:57,123 --> 00:18:59,921
How come he don't play cards
with us no more?

221
00:19:00,126 --> 00:19:01,388
I don't know.

222
00:19:02,028 --> 00:19:04,622
I know he don't think
he's better than us.

223
00:19:04,898 --> 00:19:06,923
Too busy shooting at people.

224
00:19:07,133 --> 00:19:09,624
I heard what happened there
the other night.

225
00:19:13,073 --> 00:19:15,268
He still got that same girlfriend?

226
00:19:15,542 --> 00:19:16,975
Excuse me, Mama.

227
00:19:19,045 --> 00:19:23,846
-Why do you always play football?
-Because that's what I want to do.

228
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,483
That's right.

229
00:19:30,991 --> 00:19:33,459
I heard Furious shot
at somebody last night.

230
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,560
-He get him?
-No.

231
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:41,132
Who is that?

232
00:19:41,835 --> 00:19:44,269
That's my lady, homie.
Her name's Brandi.

233
00:19:44,738 --> 00:19:47,002
She ain't your woman. She's my woman.

234
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,504
-How, when she my lady?
-She's my wife.

235
00:19:49,776 --> 00:19:53,644
I stick my ding-a-ling in her
every night, so that makes her mine.

236
00:19:53,847 --> 00:19:57,408
Get your ass in here and quit
looking at them boys!

237
00:19:57,617 --> 00:19:58,845
Punk!

238
00:19:59,486 --> 00:20:00,748
Faggot!

239
00:20:00,987 --> 00:20:04,684
Get off me, with your big
4-by-4 head! Get off!

240
00:20:05,525 --> 00:20:06,583
Get off!

241
00:20:08,094 --> 00:20:11,086
Man, forget that girl.
Come on, let's go see Chris.

242
00:20:11,331 --> 00:20:14,198
-Where's my ball?
-Man, don't bring that ball.

243
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:20,370
Me and my daddy going fishing.

244
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,301
We ain't gonna stay long.

245
00:20:22,509 --> 00:20:25,603
-Where's he live?
-He don't live far.

246
00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:33,952
Rick, why you have to bring that ball?
I ain't saying nothing if it get took.

247
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:37,650
Y'all want to see a dead body?

248
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:40,554
Yeah.

249
00:20:41,327 --> 00:20:43,955
Tre's daddy blasted
at somebody last night.

250
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,790
Really? What kind of gun
your daddy got?

251
00:20:47,734 --> 00:20:50,464
I think it's a .357 Magnum.

252
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:52,695
Really? I got a deuce-deuce.

253
00:20:52,906 --> 00:20:55,636
My brother gave it to me
before he went to jail.

254
00:20:55,842 --> 00:20:59,801
I got it under my bed. Want to see?
It's loaded too.

255
00:21:07,353 --> 00:21:08,980
It's up in here.

256
00:21:21,334 --> 00:21:22,266
Damn!

257
00:21:22,535 --> 00:21:25,402
It smell like a dog died.

258
00:21:27,674 --> 00:21:31,337
-Look like Freddy Krueger got him.
-He stink.

259
00:21:31,845 --> 00:21:34,075
That's how they smell after a while.

260
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,508
I wonder why it take them people
so long to pick him up.

261
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:41,883
Yo, man, I ain't going up in there.

262
00:21:42,622 --> 00:21:46,581
-Oh, man.
-Damn, it's stinky in this motherfucker!

263
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,795
-Hey, throw the ball.
-You ain't gonna see it again.

264
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:53,364
Don't you know this is a dead body?

265
00:21:53,566 --> 00:21:55,466
Yeah, I know that shit!

266
00:21:55,735 --> 00:21:58,203
He ain't bothering you,
so don't fuck with him!

267
00:21:59,773 --> 00:22:01,263
Throw the ball, little man.

268
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,467
I ain't gonna take it.

269
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,110
Chris, tell him I ain't
gonna take his ball.

270
00:22:06,379 --> 00:22:10,110
I got enough money to buy me
a hundred balls. Shit!

271
00:22:12,418 --> 00:22:15,251
Man, I told you not
to bring that ball.

272
00:22:21,561 --> 00:22:22,994
Thanks, cuz.

273
00:22:23,296 --> 00:22:24,627
Yo, dog.

274
00:22:25,431 --> 00:22:26,830
Throw the ball.

275
00:22:29,302 --> 00:22:30,769
Shit.

276
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,961
Let's start the game, man.

277
00:22:35,809 --> 00:22:39,040
Man, you stupid! Don't have no sense.

278
00:22:39,245 --> 00:22:42,339
Told you not to bring that ball.
Wait till I tell Mama.

279
00:22:42,582 --> 00:22:44,914
Man, shut up. I don't care.
Tell Mama.

280
00:22:47,253 --> 00:22:48,618
Y'all leaving?

281
00:22:49,923 --> 00:22:51,254
Hell, no.

282
00:22:51,491 --> 00:22:53,288
Give me my brother's ball back!

283
00:22:54,594 --> 00:22:56,858
-No, no!
-Come on, man!

284
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:00,930
No, don't say nothing.
You're gonna lose, man.

285
00:23:02,435 --> 00:23:05,871
-Give me my brother's ball back!
-What'd you say, fat boy?

286
00:23:06,105 --> 00:23:08,869
-Give me my brother's ball back be--
-Before what?

287
00:23:09,175 --> 00:23:11,769
What your fat ass gonna do?

288
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:20,451
Yo, Rock! Give the little
nigga the ball back.

289
00:23:25,158 --> 00:23:26,853
Stupid motherfucker!

290
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,494
I was gonna give it to you too.

291
00:23:41,741 --> 00:23:43,038
Man!

292
00:23:49,816 --> 00:23:52,046
Hey, man, I got a football.

293
00:23:52,318 --> 00:23:54,309
I never use it myself.

294
00:23:54,654 --> 00:23:58,681
-I give it to you when we get home.
-He ain't gonna want it.

295
00:23:59,225 --> 00:24:01,420
His daddy gave him that ball.

296
00:24:01,694 --> 00:24:04,322
Wish I could kill that motherfucker.

297
00:24:21,514 --> 00:24:23,505
Yo, Rock, give me the ball.

298
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:25,784
Give me the fucking ball!

299
00:24:30,123 --> 00:24:31,215
Hey!

300
00:24:31,925 --> 00:24:33,256
Hey, little man!

301
00:24:36,763 --> 00:24:37,923
Catch!

302
00:24:41,601 --> 00:24:43,535
Man, you sorry.

303
00:24:47,373 --> 00:24:50,706
-I'm going to the store.
-Why? You ain't got no money.

304
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,901
I'm going anyway.

305
00:24:56,749 --> 00:25:00,879
-So you a leader or a follower?
-I'm a leader.

306
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,214
Okay, then. What's the three rules?

307
00:25:04,457 --> 00:25:06,618
Break it down for me. And, hey...

308
00:25:06,893 --> 00:25:09,157
-...think before you answer.
-I got it!

309
00:25:10,129 --> 00:25:14,998
Always look a person in the eye.
Do that, they respect you better.

310
00:25:15,335 --> 00:25:19,396
Two was to never be afraid
to ask you for anything.

311
00:25:19,605 --> 00:25:21,470
Stealing isn't necessary.

312
00:25:22,308 --> 00:25:24,242
And the last one, I think, was...

313
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:27,570
...to never respect anybody
who doesn't respect you back.

314
00:25:28,247 --> 00:25:29,305
That right?

315
00:25:30,283 --> 00:25:32,945
Yeah. Yeah, you got it.

316
00:25:41,961 --> 00:25:43,986
What do you know about sex?

317
00:25:46,265 --> 00:25:49,860
-I know a little bit.
-Oh, yeah? What little bit is that?

318
00:25:50,269 --> 00:25:52,635
I know, I take a girl...

319
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:55,034
...stick my thing in her...

320
00:25:55,341 --> 00:25:58,003
...and nine months later
a baby comes out.

321
00:26:02,348 --> 00:26:03,610
You think that's it?

322
00:26:04,317 --> 00:26:05,875
Basically, yeah.

323
00:26:09,455 --> 00:26:11,719
Well, remember this:

324
00:26:12,692 --> 00:26:16,958
Anyone with a dick can make a baby, but
only a real man can raise his kids.

325
00:26:22,168 --> 00:26:25,331
I wasn't but 17 when your mother
was pregnant with you.

326
00:26:27,306 --> 00:26:30,400
All of my friends was dropping out
of high school...

327
00:26:30,676 --> 00:26:35,079
...hanging out in front of liquor
stores, getting drunk, getting high.

328
00:26:38,217 --> 00:26:40,344
Some of them was robbing people.

329
00:26:40,653 --> 00:26:42,848
Some of them was even killing people.

330
00:26:44,157 --> 00:26:46,557
Hey, you remember my friend Marcus?

331
00:26:48,428 --> 00:26:51,556
He got into robbing people,
wanted me to join him...

332
00:26:51,764 --> 00:26:54,995
...but I said, ''No,
I'm getting ready to have a son.''

333
00:26:56,669 --> 00:26:58,102
I knew you'd be a boy.

334
00:27:03,109 --> 00:27:05,737
I wanted to be somebody
you could look up to.

335
00:27:06,012 --> 00:27:09,675
So I guess that's why
I went to Vietnam.

336
00:27:09,916 --> 00:27:11,577
Don't ever go in the Army, Tre.

337
00:27:12,518 --> 00:27:14,918
Black man ain't got
no place in the Army.

338
00:27:19,058 --> 00:27:20,116
Damn!

339
00:27:25,765 --> 00:27:27,562
Why'd you get it all over me?

340
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,200
-Don't do that no more, that's nasty.
-What?

341
00:27:30,436 --> 00:27:34,270
Oh, wait! Listen to this song!
I love this song!

342
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:37,634
Things are gonna get easier

343
00:27:38,144 --> 00:27:42,444
Ooh, child
Things will get brighter

344
00:27:43,783 --> 00:27:48,049
Ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier

345
00:27:48,254 --> 00:27:49,778
Oh, damn!

346
00:27:51,324 --> 00:27:53,087
Looks like they going to juvie.

347
00:27:53,292 --> 00:27:56,921
No, man. They going to the gates.

348
00:28:01,901 --> 00:28:04,392
-Yo, man, what happened?
-They were stealing.

349
00:28:06,005 --> 00:28:10,999
Someday we'll walk in
The rays of a beautiful sun

350
00:28:11,244 --> 00:28:15,180
Someday when the world
Is much brighter

351
00:28:16,849 --> 00:28:21,843
Ooh, child
Things are gonna be easier

352
00:28:22,355 --> 00:28:26,291
Ooh, child
Things will be brighter

353
00:28:28,027 --> 00:28:33,124
Ooh, child
Things are gonna be easier

354
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:37,535
Ooh, child
Things will be brighter

355
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:44,169
Someday, we'll get it together
And we'll get it undone

356
00:28:44,477 --> 00:28:46,377
Someday

357
00:28:49,048 --> 00:28:52,142
Come on, Tre. Let's go, son.

358
00:29:22,348 --> 00:29:23,645
Come here, Rick.

359
00:29:24,517 --> 00:29:25,711
Come on, man.

360
00:29:26,185 --> 00:29:29,211
Come here, man. Look at all
these people back here.

361
00:29:31,324 --> 00:29:32,848
There you go!

362
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:35,687
Want to learn how to barbecue? Huh?

363
00:29:38,831 --> 00:29:42,597
You're not watching this meat.
You just standing here poking at it.

364
00:29:42,835 --> 00:29:45,269
-Give him to me, Ricky.
-Shanice, I got him.

365
00:29:45,538 --> 00:29:47,062
Go on back to your friends.

366
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:51,333
-He's wet. That's why he's crying.
-He ain't wet. Now, go on back.

367
00:29:51,577 --> 00:29:54,444
-Okay.
-Listen, I'm sorry. Come here.

368
00:29:57,383 --> 00:29:59,874
See? That's how y'all got that one.

369
00:30:01,387 --> 00:30:04,584
Ricky, you make sure
she taking them pills.

370
00:30:04,857 --> 00:30:07,018
I don't want a bunch of these around.

371
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,490
I'll be the one
taking care of them.

372
00:30:09,695 --> 00:30:12,220
-I'll put him to bed.
-Go on to Grandma.

373
00:30:12,431 --> 00:30:16,561
It's all right. All right,
okay, shut up, come on.

374
00:30:17,036 --> 00:30:18,901
And fllp that meat over.

375
00:30:24,143 --> 00:30:25,542
I'm winning.

376
00:30:26,912 --> 00:30:29,972
Domino, motherfuckers.
What you say about that?

377
00:30:31,651 --> 00:30:35,052
Fool, that ain't shit.
I beat your ass three times already.

378
00:30:35,288 --> 00:30:37,552
That's just once.
Let's play again.

379
00:30:39,392 --> 00:30:43,488
Fuck that, I don't want to play no more.
Let's bust some spades.

380
00:30:43,763 --> 00:30:46,129
-Yeah, I'm with that.
-Bust some spades?

381
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:47,891
Cool.

382
00:30:51,804 --> 00:30:55,137
-Know how to play spades, Dook?
-Something like that.

383
00:30:55,341 --> 00:30:58,401
I have something to suck on.
Here, cut that, G.

384
00:31:01,314 --> 00:31:03,509
I want one of them hootchies
over there.

385
00:31:09,422 --> 00:31:13,518
Dooky, you full of shit. No bitch
gonna give your ugly ass no pussy.

386
00:31:13,793 --> 00:31:15,590
I bet I get more pussy than you.

387
00:31:16,495 --> 00:31:17,462
Yeah.

388
00:31:18,464 --> 00:31:19,988
You get dope-head pussy.

389
00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:23,325
I get more pussy than your
wannabe mack-daddy ass--

390
00:31:23,602 --> 00:31:26,298
-Who you calling wannabe mack daddy?
-You, nigga!

391
00:31:26,672 --> 00:31:28,833
No-pussy-getting motherfucker!

392
00:31:29,108 --> 00:31:31,975
Fucking them dope-heads,
you stupid-ass nigga.

393
00:31:32,178 --> 00:31:35,841
You don't know what I be getting.
Don't be fucking no dope-heads.

394
00:31:36,048 --> 00:31:39,017
I let them suck my dick,
but I don't fuck them.

395
00:31:39,852 --> 00:31:41,444
They got AIDS and shit.

396
00:31:41,687 --> 00:31:45,646
You can catch that shit from letting
them suck on your dick too.

397
00:31:45,891 --> 00:31:46,983
Thank you.

398
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,961
But I ain't sick.
I ain't all skinny and shit.

399
00:31:51,197 --> 00:31:53,165
What you mean, you ain't skinny?

400
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:56,698
Motherfucker's skinny enough to
hula-hoop through a Cheerio.

401
00:31:56,969 --> 00:32:02,066
You ain't got to be skinny or sick.
You could die in five years from it.

402
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:05,640
-Mark ass.
-Y'all trying to scare me.

403
00:32:10,082 --> 00:32:12,915
Can you really get it from
letting them suck it?

404
00:32:13,386 --> 00:32:14,648
Mark.

405
00:32:33,739 --> 00:32:36,401
Tre? How you doing, baby?

406
00:32:36,609 --> 00:32:39,601
-Fine.
-Good, you just in time for the food.

407
00:32:39,845 --> 00:32:42,075
I'm bringing out
the rest of the things.

408
00:32:42,348 --> 00:32:44,612
Potato salad. You name it, we got it.

409
00:32:45,851 --> 00:32:48,911
-Everybody's here, so have a good time.
-Okay.

410
00:32:49,121 --> 00:32:51,555
Oh, and Tre? Baby, do me a favour.

411
00:32:51,791 --> 00:32:55,283
Talk to Darin for me.
Talk to him seriously, you hear?

412
00:32:55,528 --> 00:32:58,964
I am so sick and tired of him
going in and out of there.

413
00:32:59,231 --> 00:33:02,200
Maybe some of what you got
will rub off on him.

414
00:33:02,701 --> 00:33:04,066
Okay.

415
00:33:12,278 --> 00:33:13,711
What's up, Dough?

416
00:33:14,146 --> 00:33:17,980
Oh, shit! What up, G?
Tre, love in effect.

417
00:33:18,217 --> 00:33:19,741
Yo, what's up, Tre?

418
00:33:20,052 --> 00:33:24,182
-What's up, Chris?
-Heard you're like Mr. GQ Smooth now.

419
00:33:25,591 --> 00:33:29,823
-Working over at the Fox Hills Mall.
-I get discounts on clothes, you like?

420
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:33,225
You look like you selling rocks.

421
00:33:33,432 --> 00:33:37,528
-Tre, you be slinging that shit?
-No, I don't be doing that shit.

422
00:33:37,837 --> 00:33:40,704
Couldn't anyway.
Pops'd kick your ass.

423
00:33:42,842 --> 00:33:44,776
You know, I'm out of the pen now.

424
00:33:46,045 --> 00:33:48,377
Trying to keep my ass out this time.

425
00:33:48,581 --> 00:33:52,415
-That's what we here to celebrate.
-Yeah.

426
00:33:53,886 --> 00:33:55,945
Damn, brother, how did you get so big?

427
00:33:57,389 --> 00:33:59,619
Pumping iron and eating, man.

428
00:33:59,925 --> 00:34:02,359
Nothing else to do in
the motherfucking pen.

429
00:34:02,862 --> 00:34:05,695
Three hots and a cot,
know what I'm saying?

430
00:34:06,365 --> 00:34:09,528
Rest of the time I was
reading and writing my girl.

431
00:34:09,735 --> 00:34:11,965
-Reading?
-Yeah, motherfucker.

432
00:34:12,204 --> 00:34:15,469
I ain't no criminal.
I can read, bitch.

433
00:34:17,776 --> 00:34:19,471
Who is that, Shanice?

434
00:34:19,778 --> 00:34:21,973
That's Tre, Ricky's best friend.

435
00:34:22,248 --> 00:34:25,115
He was best friends with Doughboy
when they was little.

436
00:34:25,384 --> 00:34:27,614
They be trying to act
like they brothers.

437
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,549
Girl, he is fine!
I'd like to rush that!

438
00:34:31,757 --> 00:34:35,591
-He go to Washington?
-He go to Crenshaw.

439
00:34:35,794 --> 00:34:38,729
I seen him before.
He work at the Fox Hills Mall.

440
00:34:38,931 --> 00:34:42,162
Do he got a girlfriend?

441
00:34:43,435 --> 00:34:44,663
Yes.

442
00:34:52,678 --> 00:34:56,614
Jamaica, girl, I was scoping
on this ho's man.

443
00:34:56,849 --> 00:35:00,945
He fine, anyway. You better watch
his ass. Somebody might steal him.

444
00:35:03,522 --> 00:35:05,956
All right, y'all, come and get it!

445
00:35:14,767 --> 00:35:18,430
-Do you live here?
-Okay, girl. Sorry-ass niggas.

446
00:35:19,371 --> 00:35:20,531
Come on.

447
00:35:20,806 --> 00:35:24,799
Why don't y'all act like gentlemen
and let these ladies eat first!

448
00:35:26,445 --> 00:35:29,642
Yeah, you act like you ain't
never had no barbecue before.

449
00:35:29,882 --> 00:35:32,510
Let the ladies eat.
Hos gotta eat too.

450
00:35:32,785 --> 00:35:35,948
Wait, nigga, who you calling a ho?
I ain't no ho.

451
00:35:36,155 --> 00:35:38,487
Oops. I'm sorry, bitch.

452
00:35:38,724 --> 00:35:42,216
-Hey, hey, watch your mouth.
-Just playing.

453
00:35:42,528 --> 00:35:44,120
All right, enjoy.

454
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:45,297
And be nice.

455
00:35:46,899 --> 00:35:49,732
Get out of the way!
You still up here?

456
00:35:52,004 --> 00:35:54,131
-Hi.
-Hello.

457
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,401
So why haven't you called?

458
00:35:58,978 --> 00:36:00,843
Just one minute.

459
00:36:11,423 --> 00:36:13,857
What's up, my brother?
She wants to talk to you.

460
00:36:14,093 --> 00:36:16,687
-I know. I'm just taking my time.
-Oh, I see.

461
00:36:16,929 --> 00:36:20,831
-You trying to run that game on her.
-Yeah, how am I doing?

462
00:36:21,066 --> 00:36:23,728
Well, you're doing just fine.

463
00:36:24,003 --> 00:36:26,267
-Except for one thing.
-Yeah, what's that?

464
00:36:26,572 --> 00:36:27,732
She left.

465
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,098
What?

466
00:36:30,209 --> 00:36:32,507
-Damn!
-That's all right.

467
00:36:34,613 --> 00:36:36,171
Hey, hey, hey.

468
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:42,714
Ain't this a bitch?

469
00:36:45,858 --> 00:36:47,917
Wait! Wait!

470
00:36:51,764 --> 00:36:55,200
-Don't worry about it. I got her.
-Is she all right?

471
00:36:56,268 --> 00:36:57,735
All right, G.

472
00:37:06,111 --> 00:37:08,602
Sheryl! Come on!

473
00:37:11,583 --> 00:37:16,077
Keep your baby out the street.
She gonna get hit one of these days.

474
00:37:16,321 --> 00:37:18,983
You got some blow? You got some rock?

475
00:37:19,291 --> 00:37:23,591
-I'll suck your dick.
-Just keep the baby off the streets.

476
00:37:24,596 --> 00:37:28,555
And change her diapers.
Girl almost smell as bad as you.

477
00:37:38,644 --> 00:37:41,010
What up, punk? What up, fool?

478
00:37:45,651 --> 00:37:46,948
Mark.

479
00:38:02,468 --> 00:38:04,698
-What is that? Barbecue?
-Yeah.

480
00:38:13,812 --> 00:38:16,178
-I know you didn't bring me no swine.
-No.

481
00:38:16,448 --> 00:38:19,042
Mrs. Baker told me
to bring you a plate.

482
00:38:19,685 --> 00:38:21,983
-Brenda, huh?
-Yeah.

483
00:38:23,288 --> 00:38:26,348
She might've had a chance
if she didn't talk so much.

484
00:38:28,193 --> 00:38:29,683
Let's see.

485
00:38:37,803 --> 00:38:41,796
She ain't lost her touch.
She still can make some barbecue.

486
00:38:43,675 --> 00:38:47,475
Hey, Pop, can you fix my fade
back here? And up here?

487
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,513
I'm eating.

488
00:38:50,983 --> 00:38:52,416
After you eat.

489
00:38:55,587 --> 00:38:56,576
Yeah.

490
00:39:00,993 --> 00:39:02,483
Yeah, real close.

491
00:39:02,728 --> 00:39:06,186
So I can brush it, you know,
hook up some waves.

492
00:39:11,703 --> 00:39:12,829
Something wrong?

493
00:39:14,173 --> 00:39:15,367
Nope.

494
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,781
What's the problem?

495
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,915
You're getting old, Pop.

496
00:39:30,589 --> 00:39:33,114
-I'm getting old?
-Yeah.

497
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:36,225
I'm getting better, young brother.
You getting old.

498
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:38,952
-You older than dirt.
-I'm older than dirt?

499
00:39:39,231 --> 00:39:43,361
-Yes.
-I am but 17 years older than you.

500
00:39:43,602 --> 00:39:46,696
Your friends, they got fathers
in their 40s and 50s.

501
00:39:46,972 --> 00:39:50,806
These cats are great big....
Just slobs, man.

502
00:39:51,076 --> 00:39:54,807
-You know, bellies out to here.
-Yes. That's gonna be you!

503
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:58,277
That's gonna be you, man.
Big old fat, juicy roll...

504
00:39:58,483 --> 00:40:01,077
...double-jelly-roll belly. Right?

505
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:05,086
Sitting in a rocking chair,
reading the funny papers!

506
00:40:05,324 --> 00:40:08,384
Then your grandchildren will be
running around, saying:

507
00:40:08,627 --> 00:40:12,290
''Granddaddy, give me something.
Give me a dollar.''

508
00:40:12,497 --> 00:40:13,623
You think so, huh?

509
00:40:14,066 --> 00:40:15,226
Yeah.

510
00:40:15,734 --> 00:40:17,292
Wait a minute, man.

511
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:21,403
What's all this about grandkids, man?

512
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,403
You using the rubbers I gave you?

513
00:40:23,675 --> 00:40:26,667
I ain't ready to be a granddaddy,
all right? I just....

514
00:40:26,912 --> 00:40:29,437
I ain't ready for all of that.

515
00:40:29,681 --> 00:40:32,149
Don't worry.
I can take care of myself.

516
00:40:32,417 --> 00:40:34,612
Why are you sweating me, man?

517
00:40:35,621 --> 00:40:38,590
Tre, close the refrigerator.
Close it. Come here.

518
00:40:38,857 --> 00:40:40,017
What?

519
00:40:41,693 --> 00:40:42,751
All right?

520
00:40:51,169 --> 00:40:54,195
What? I stink now?
I got something on me?

521
00:40:56,275 --> 00:40:58,175
-You had some pussy yet?
-What?

522
00:40:58,443 --> 00:41:01,776
-You had some pussy yet?
-Yeah! Yeah!

523
00:41:02,014 --> 00:41:03,208
When?

524
00:41:03,448 --> 00:41:05,279
-What?
-When?

525
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:11,020
All right, all right.
Just sit down for a second.

526
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:13,190
Go on, sit down, now.

527
00:41:21,166 --> 00:41:25,830
It was a Sunday, right? Rick and I
were kicking it up on Crenshaw.

528
00:41:26,038 --> 00:41:28,506
This group of females
rolled up in a Rabbit.

529
00:41:28,707 --> 00:41:33,667
Everybody trying to bum-rush them.
Trying to jib and all, right?

530
00:41:33,879 --> 00:41:38,475
Man, there was this one girl
everybody was trying to rush.

531
00:41:38,717 --> 00:41:41,151
Baby was fine

532
00:41:41,987 --> 00:41:44,820
Body was booming,
like right out of Jet centerfold.

533
00:41:47,192 --> 00:41:48,887
So I'm, like, eyeballing her.

534
00:41:49,094 --> 00:41:52,928
She walks right up on me and
busts out, ''Is this your ride?''

535
00:41:53,432 --> 00:41:56,697
Then I say, ''Yeah, you want to go
for a ride with me?''

536
00:41:56,902 --> 00:42:00,167
She says, ''No, I want to drive it.''

537
00:42:00,405 --> 00:42:04,000
I say, ''Can you drive stick?''

538
00:42:04,209 --> 00:42:08,373
She says, ''I can learn
if you teach me.''

539
00:42:09,681 --> 00:42:14,277
I go into my mack-daddy mode because
I'm getting a woody in my sweats.

540
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:19,252
I says, ''Why don't you give me your
number, I'll call you for a lesson.''

541
00:42:20,592 --> 00:42:22,253
She does.

542
00:42:22,794 --> 00:42:25,388
About a week later,
I'm over at her house.

543
00:42:25,697 --> 00:42:28,461
Her mom and grandma
are leaving for church.

544
00:42:29,368 --> 00:42:31,233
I walk right up to the door, man.

545
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:34,928
As soon as I go inside, boom
We go at it, nonstop.

546
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,767
Kissing, hugging, right?

547
00:42:37,042 --> 00:42:39,943
So I pick her up, take her upstairs.

548
00:42:42,748 --> 00:42:47,412
Well, about 20 minutes into it,
Mom and Grandma's come home.

549
00:42:47,753 --> 00:42:49,812
Seems Grandma forgot her purse.

550
00:42:50,155 --> 00:42:53,488
Wanted to make sure she has something
to put in the collection plate.

551
00:42:55,627 --> 00:42:59,825
Yeah, I guess she could smell the sex
in the air or something, right?

552
00:43:04,436 --> 00:43:07,735
She starts straight
towards Tisha's room.

553
00:43:12,677 --> 00:43:15,168
That's the last I ever saw of Tisha.

554
00:43:16,281 --> 00:43:18,306
I call her once in a while...

555
00:43:18,583 --> 00:43:23,748
...but when I do, her mom or grandma
say, ''She can't talk right now.

556
00:43:24,156 --> 00:43:26,852
She busy, doing the dishes.''

557
00:43:29,861 --> 00:43:33,820
-What'd you use?
-I used the number she gave me.

558
00:43:36,968 --> 00:43:38,492
Why are you sweating me?

559
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:41,671
I had to use nothing.
She said she was on the pill.

560
00:43:47,379 --> 00:43:50,439
How many times I tell you?
If a girl's on the pill...

561
00:43:50,682 --> 00:43:52,707
...you use something anyway.

562
00:43:56,655 --> 00:43:59,317
A pill ain't gonna keep
your dick from falling off.

563
00:44:02,461 --> 00:44:05,862
I don't know why you insist on
learning things the hard way...

564
00:44:06,064 --> 00:44:08,692
...but you gonna learn.
Oh, yeah, you gonna learn!

565
00:44:12,571 --> 00:44:14,038
Clean up that hair.

566
00:44:24,916 --> 00:44:26,315
What's up, man?

567
00:44:27,486 --> 00:44:29,886
-What the fuck is wrong with you?!
-What?

568
00:44:30,088 --> 00:44:33,580
You slamming my door like
some gorilla on a football field!

569
00:44:33,892 --> 00:44:37,350
-Damn, nigga, what's wrong with you?
-Nothing.

570
00:44:46,004 --> 00:44:47,403
Guess what, man?

571
00:44:48,039 --> 00:44:51,031
-Recruiter from SC's coming tonight.
-Cool.

572
00:44:52,177 --> 00:44:54,702
You know, man,
I never lled to my father.

573
00:44:55,247 --> 00:44:56,544
Never?

574
00:44:57,582 --> 00:44:59,447
Well, almost never.

575
00:45:01,887 --> 00:45:03,354
Where's all this coming from?

576
00:45:03,588 --> 00:45:05,522
Where's all this coming from?

577
00:45:06,224 --> 00:45:10,126
I lled to Pops yesterday.
Told him I weren't no virgin.

578
00:45:10,595 --> 00:45:12,722
Well, you ain't a virgin, is you?

579
00:45:13,865 --> 00:45:14,889
Is you?

580
00:45:16,067 --> 00:45:18,262
Well, technically speaking,
I haven't.

581
00:45:18,537 --> 00:45:20,835
You know, I fingered
a couple of honeys...

582
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:25,703
...and sucked on some titties,
but I ain't never stuck it in.

583
00:45:25,944 --> 00:45:27,206
Why not, man?

584
00:45:27,412 --> 00:45:31,212
-You really want to know?
-Yeah, I asked you, didn't I?

585
00:45:32,918 --> 00:45:34,385
I was afraid.

586
00:45:39,658 --> 00:45:41,785
-Shit!
-Get off me.

587
00:45:49,568 --> 00:45:52,833
-See, man? Shut up. Shut up.
-What you doing, man?

588
00:45:56,141 --> 00:45:57,665
What you afraid of, man?

589
00:45:58,476 --> 00:46:00,000
Of being a daddy.

590
00:46:01,313 --> 00:46:03,679
Oh. Well, yeah.

591
00:46:03,982 --> 00:46:05,643
But I'm getting old now, see?

592
00:46:05,917 --> 00:46:09,751
And now that I want to slap some skins,
Brandi ain't even down for it.

593
00:46:09,988 --> 00:46:14,322
-Even with a jimmy she ain't down.
-Is that right?

594
00:46:31,009 --> 00:46:33,500
-I don't see that.
-Why the silent treatment?

595
00:46:33,778 --> 00:46:35,973
You haven't talked to me in five days!

596
00:46:36,181 --> 00:46:38,308
You tell your father to say
you're not home.

597
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:42,452
-Then you take the phone off the hook!
-Well, I been busy.

598
00:46:42,654 --> 00:46:47,318
Oh, well, don't give me no bald-ass
excuse for a lle like that!

599
00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:51,655
What did I do that was so bad that
you just had to stop talking to me?

600
00:46:51,896 --> 00:46:56,026
See, you know what you did.
See, you gotta get with the program.

601
00:46:56,568 --> 00:47:00,971
I told you about that. I'm Catholic,
and it goes against my morals.

602
00:47:01,172 --> 00:47:06,007
Yeah, but Catholic girls are supposed
to be one of the biggest hootchies.

603
00:47:06,244 --> 00:47:11,045
-When you bust a cap on somebody?
-I bust a cap like, blam-blam.

604
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:13,549
Damn! God!

605
00:47:27,832 --> 00:47:30,858
Come on, fuck him up, man!
Fuck him up!

606
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:39,241
You say you want to wait till
you get married first, right?

607
00:47:39,444 --> 00:47:40,934
No, look at me. Right?

608
00:47:41,379 --> 00:47:42,346
Yeah.

609
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:46,516
And I say that I'm gonna be
the one who marries you.

610
00:47:47,185 --> 00:47:50,518
So it don't make no difference
when we do it...

611
00:47:50,755 --> 00:47:52,279
...we still gonna get married, right?

612
00:47:52,724 --> 00:47:55,215
Yeah, but I'm going
to college before I marry...

613
00:47:55,427 --> 00:47:59,022
...and there ain't no guarantee
that I'm gonna marry you!

614
00:48:06,905 --> 00:48:08,634
Bad shit!

615
00:48:11,943 --> 00:48:14,912
Hey, hey, yo. Yo, bonita.

616
00:48:16,414 --> 00:48:17,779
Damn, look at that ass.

617
00:48:18,049 --> 00:48:22,110
Chica bonita. You come to my casa
and let's do the loco thing.

618
00:48:22,387 --> 00:48:25,481
Hey, Dooky, this fool trying
to speak Spanish....

619
00:48:27,592 --> 00:48:29,617
-That shit worked.
-What up, baby?

620
00:48:29,828 --> 00:48:32,991
So let me knock the stuffing
off that Egg McMuffin.

621
00:48:34,232 --> 00:48:35,722
You got a phone number?

622
00:48:47,312 --> 00:48:51,305
-You haven't even given me a ring!
-I ain't ready for all that yet!

623
00:48:51,516 --> 00:48:53,950
But you're ready to act
like we are, though?

624
00:49:00,358 --> 00:49:02,485
-What your man say?
-Don't touch me.

625
00:49:02,794 --> 00:49:03,852
All right.

626
00:49:17,675 --> 00:49:21,008
-You make me sick, man.
-I know, but I missed you.

627
00:49:21,279 --> 00:49:22,678
I missed you too.

628
00:49:23,114 --> 00:49:24,513
I missed you too.

629
00:49:37,495 --> 00:49:39,486
He still ain't fucked her yet.

630
00:49:48,072 --> 00:49:50,302
You better take your ass
to the store with that.

631
00:49:50,842 --> 00:49:53,072
So you gonna give me
the skins or what?

632
00:49:53,812 --> 00:49:56,406
No, that's not all I think about.

633
00:49:57,048 --> 00:49:58,310
Yeah.

634
00:49:58,883 --> 00:50:02,080
-Okay. Pop!
-Yo!

635
00:50:02,353 --> 00:50:04,548
Brandi's mom say you're cute!

636
00:50:04,823 --> 00:50:08,054
Ask her how come she don't say hi
when I speak to her.

637
00:50:08,259 --> 00:50:11,490
He say, ''How come she don't say hi
when he speak to her?''

638
00:50:12,564 --> 00:50:13,724
Yeah.

639
00:50:14,833 --> 00:50:18,769
Hey, I'm supposed to be talking
to you, not passing messages.

640
00:50:20,004 --> 00:50:23,531
If my daddy mess with your mama,
we gonna be brother and sister.

641
00:50:23,775 --> 00:50:26,243
Then we have to do that incest thing.

642
00:50:26,444 --> 00:50:27,706
What?

643
00:50:28,012 --> 00:50:32,278
No, no, I'm just kidding.
Wait, hang on, I got another call.

644
00:50:34,052 --> 00:50:35,212
Who this?

645
00:50:35,854 --> 00:50:37,287
Oh, hi, Mama.

646
00:50:37,922 --> 00:50:41,449
Yeah. Hang on, I got Brandi
on the other line, okay?

647
00:50:45,296 --> 00:50:47,856
So you gonna give me
the skins or what?

648
00:50:48,099 --> 00:50:50,727
Tre, this is your mother.

649
00:50:52,737 --> 00:50:56,070
I'm sorry, Mama.
Hang on for one second. Okay.

650
00:50:57,208 --> 00:51:00,041
Brandi?
Yeah, I'm gonna call you back.

651
00:51:00,278 --> 00:51:01,267
Okay.

652
00:51:03,314 --> 00:51:04,212
Hi, Mama.

653
00:51:04,449 --> 00:51:06,474
''Who this''?

654
00:51:06,784 --> 00:51:09,218
What kind of way is that
to answer the phone?

655
00:51:09,721 --> 00:51:11,154
I'm sorry, Mama.

656
00:51:11,489 --> 00:51:15,653
-Why didn't you come by this weekend?
-I was cooling with Rick.

657
00:51:17,228 --> 00:51:19,321
You can cool with
your friends anytime.

658
00:51:19,631 --> 00:51:22,566
The weekends are supposed
to be our time together.

659
00:51:24,302 --> 00:51:26,930
Have you thought about
what we talked about?

660
00:51:27,639 --> 00:51:28,833
Yeah.

661
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,737
And?

662
00:51:31,943 --> 00:51:33,410
I don't know yet.

663
00:51:35,346 --> 00:51:37,405
Let me speak to your daddy.

664
00:51:39,183 --> 00:51:40,172
Pop!

665
00:51:40,485 --> 00:51:41,747
Telephone!

666
00:51:44,923 --> 00:51:45,821
Who this?

667
00:51:46,157 --> 00:51:48,819
Hey, how you doing?

668
00:51:49,861 --> 00:51:50,691
Yeah.

669
00:51:50,962 --> 00:51:52,827
Yeah, we talked about that.

670
00:51:54,465 --> 00:51:56,831
Yeah, well, look....

671
00:51:57,468 --> 00:52:00,869
I know you don't agree with me,
but I think it's his decision.

672
00:52:01,139 --> 00:52:04,302
Look, I don't--
No, I don't think that's necessary.

673
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:08,946
Look, Reva.
Reva, this is bullshit.

674
00:52:10,348 --> 00:52:12,714
I'm sorry,
but I think it's ridiculous.

675
00:52:12,984 --> 00:52:16,852
There's no reason for him
to come live with you now.

676
00:52:17,055 --> 00:52:18,886
He's not a baby!

677
00:52:20,792 --> 00:52:24,057
No, no, wait a minute.
Why you got an attitude?

678
00:52:24,295 --> 00:52:26,525
I don't have an attitude.
You have an attitude!

679
00:52:26,965 --> 00:52:30,526
We have gone through this a thousand
times. I always tell him...

680
00:52:30,735 --> 00:52:33,203
...use a rubber!
You know, use a rubber--

681
00:52:34,072 --> 00:52:35,903
Watch me shoot this motherfucker.

682
00:52:37,008 --> 00:52:38,236
Look.

683
00:52:40,645 --> 00:52:41,839
Yeah.

684
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:45,638
-Taken off the motherfucking set.
-Hey, yo, Monster, man.

685
00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:49,752
Don't be cussing so motherfucking
loud. My moms don't like that shit.

686
00:52:49,988 --> 00:52:53,890
Come on, man, move the plastic.
You're sitting on the good part.

687
00:52:54,158 --> 00:52:55,352
Damn!

688
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:56,820
Darin?

689
00:52:58,529 --> 00:53:00,724
See, now I gotta hear this shit.

690
00:53:01,899 --> 00:53:03,264
Darin!

691
00:53:04,369 --> 00:53:07,031
-What?
-Get them drive-by shooters out of--

692
00:53:07,238 --> 00:53:11,231
Damn! Moms be fucking
with his ass without fall.

693
00:53:11,509 --> 00:53:13,409
She ain't like that with Rick, though.

694
00:53:13,911 --> 00:53:15,776
Because they got different daddies.

695
00:53:16,014 --> 00:53:20,451
Y'all got to get the fuck out.
My brother got company in a minute.

696
00:53:20,685 --> 00:53:23,950
-See that? I didn't get my turn.
-It's Monster's fault.

697
00:53:24,255 --> 00:53:26,223
Come on, man. Fix that shit, man.

698
00:53:32,563 --> 00:53:33,928
What up, man?

699
00:53:34,365 --> 00:53:35,798
What up, dude?

700
00:53:36,401 --> 00:53:37,459
Who that?

701
00:54:07,165 --> 00:54:09,929
Anybody know where Ricky Baker lives?

702
00:54:10,935 --> 00:54:12,926
That's my brother! He live here.

703
00:54:13,171 --> 00:54:15,469
Hey, yo, Rick!
The man here to see you!

704
00:54:15,773 --> 00:54:17,104
Stop.

705
00:54:19,577 --> 00:54:21,977
Stop. Hold still. Be still.

706
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:23,147
There, I got it.

707
00:54:23,347 --> 00:54:25,907
Yo, Rick!
Get your ass out of there.

708
00:54:26,117 --> 00:54:29,018
Ricky, come on out of
the bathroom, baby.

709
00:54:30,455 --> 00:54:32,753
Check this out.
Here come the reverend.

710
00:54:37,328 --> 00:54:39,023
So what college you from?

711
00:54:39,297 --> 00:54:41,322
I'm from USC.

712
00:54:41,532 --> 00:54:44,000
You got to have a scholarship
to go to SC?

713
00:54:45,103 --> 00:54:46,661
No, but it helps.

714
00:54:47,038 --> 00:54:49,097
Can you hook me up with a scholarship?

715
00:54:49,707 --> 00:54:52,540
-What do you do?
-I used to play baseball.

716
00:54:53,377 --> 00:54:54,344
Shut up, man.

717
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:58,010
Don't you know
the man's about business?

718
00:54:58,282 --> 00:55:01,479
Move, nigga. Move, punk.

719
00:55:02,353 --> 00:55:03,615
Move.

720
00:55:07,992 --> 00:55:09,482
Y'all be the fuck quiet.

721
00:55:09,794 --> 00:55:10,783
Hello.

722
00:55:11,195 --> 00:55:13,561
I'm Lewis Crump.
You must be Ricky's mother.

723
00:55:14,132 --> 00:55:15,064
Brenda.

724
00:55:15,299 --> 00:55:17,631
And this is my other son, Darin.

725
00:55:17,835 --> 00:55:19,359
-Hello, Darin.
-What's up?

726
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:21,504
Can I get you something to drink?

727
00:55:21,706 --> 00:55:24,038
-Coffee, water, soda?
-No, thank you.

728
00:55:24,509 --> 00:55:26,909
We met at the game against Washington.

729
00:55:27,145 --> 00:55:31,980
I remember. That was a good game.
You picked up 276 yards in that game.

730
00:55:32,216 --> 00:55:33,843
-That's impressive.
-Thanks.

731
00:55:34,051 --> 00:55:36,542
Well, why don't y'all sit and talk?

732
00:55:38,222 --> 00:55:39,246
Hey!

733
00:55:58,042 --> 00:56:02,172
I want you to know we're interested
in you coming to the campus.

734
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:05,941
Get a good look around, you know,
a feel for the school as a whole.

735
00:56:12,089 --> 00:56:13,454
Here's my tape.

736
00:56:19,197 --> 00:56:21,859
That was against Banning
my junior year.

737
00:56:23,134 --> 00:56:26,297
Man, we lost that year,
but I did pretty well in yardage.

738
00:56:27,405 --> 00:56:30,135
They had the best defence
in the city that year.

739
00:56:33,644 --> 00:56:36,875
Big country booty!
Big country titties!

740
00:56:37,081 --> 00:56:39,606
-Boo-ya!
-That's what I'm saying.

741
00:56:39,884 --> 00:56:42,876
From eating all that corn bread
and shit, I guess.

742
00:56:44,956 --> 00:56:48,949
Shit. Me, I go to college
just for the hos.

743
00:56:49,227 --> 00:56:50,990
You don't go there to talk to bitches.

744
00:56:51,262 --> 00:56:53,423
You're supposed to be
learning something.

745
00:56:53,664 --> 00:56:57,065
Can't learn shit, talking
to no stupid-ass bitch.

746
00:57:01,005 --> 00:57:04,133
-Yo, check out that 808.
-Damn, that shit bumping.

747
00:57:05,009 --> 00:57:08,103
What are you interested in
beside playing ball?

748
00:57:09,981 --> 00:57:11,642
-Like, what you mean?
-I mean...

749
00:57:11,916 --> 00:57:15,818
...what do you want to major in?
What kind of degree would you pursue?

750
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:19,353
I'm just asking because
there's a strong possibility...

751
00:57:19,624 --> 00:57:22,491
...that you won't go into
the NFL after college.

752
00:57:22,693 --> 00:57:24,991
Just a fact. It happens.

753
00:57:25,496 --> 00:57:27,930
Yeah, I heard that before.

754
00:57:28,666 --> 00:57:31,601
Actually, I was thinking
about majoring in business.

755
00:57:31,869 --> 00:57:36,272
I got this friend, Tre, who's always
talked about going into business.

756
00:57:36,474 --> 00:57:38,999
Plus, I like computers.
Maybe I could do that.

757
00:57:39,644 --> 00:57:41,043
What do you think?

758
00:57:41,345 --> 00:57:45,111
Young brother, I think you can do
anything you put your mind to.

759
00:57:50,721 --> 00:57:53,155
I tell you where y'all need to go.

760
00:57:53,457 --> 00:57:57,621
Where they got more women
than anywhere. Fine ones too.

761
00:57:57,862 --> 00:58:00,228
-Crenshaw on Sunday nights.
-No.

762
00:58:00,464 --> 00:58:04,059
-Street races on Florence?
-No, nigga. Y'all way off.

763
00:58:04,568 --> 00:58:06,502
I give y'all a hint.

764
00:58:07,204 --> 00:58:08,671
Everybody's been there.

765
00:58:08,873 --> 00:58:09,737
Where?

766
00:58:09,974 --> 00:58:12,204
Where, nigga? Spit it out!

767
00:58:12,977 --> 00:58:14,205
The church.

768
00:58:14,412 --> 00:58:16,539
Oh, shit!

769
00:58:16,747 --> 00:58:21,650
Nigga, please! Ain't nobody going
to church to catch no bitches.

770
00:58:22,086 --> 00:58:25,920
I should roll your ass up off
this porch for that stupid shit.

771
00:58:26,924 --> 00:58:30,485
So basically you have
a 2.3 overall GPA...

772
00:58:30,728 --> 00:58:32,753
...according to the classes
we require.

773
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:35,430
All you have to do
is take the SAT test.

774
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:37,431
Yeah.

775
00:58:37,868 --> 00:58:39,699
I heard about that test.

776
00:58:39,937 --> 00:58:43,338
The next one's being offered,
let's see...

777
00:58:43,674 --> 00:58:46,165
...early October.
Are you gonna take it?

778
00:58:46,410 --> 00:58:49,243
I guess so. I can't get into
college without it, right?

779
00:58:49,513 --> 00:58:53,415
Just remember, all you have
to do is get over a 700.

780
00:58:53,918 --> 00:58:56,751
-Okay.
-Come here. Come here!

781
00:58:57,388 --> 00:59:01,381
I'm sorry, I'm trying to give
him a bath. Come here.

782
00:59:03,527 --> 00:59:04,892
Your little brother?

783
00:59:05,363 --> 00:59:07,593
No, that's my son.

784
00:59:11,435 --> 00:59:14,927
Well, I'll look forward
to talking to you again.

785
00:59:15,473 --> 00:59:17,634
We'll also arrange that tour for you.

786
00:59:17,875 --> 00:59:19,467
Thank you, Mr. Crump.

787
00:59:20,244 --> 00:59:22,610
You bet, Ricky. Bye-bye.

788
00:59:26,817 --> 00:59:30,947
You gonna give me a scholarship?
Because I want to go to college too.

789
00:59:31,222 --> 00:59:34,123
-Man, shut the fuck up.
-Fuck you, nigga.

790
00:59:34,392 --> 00:59:36,792
It's my porch.
You can take your dumb ass home.

791
00:59:36,994 --> 00:59:39,895
My baby is going to a university.

792
00:59:42,066 --> 00:59:44,933
I always knew you would
amount to something.

793
00:59:45,436 --> 00:59:46,596
I did.

794
00:59:47,004 --> 00:59:51,464
When you were little, you used to
always run around with that football.

795
00:59:53,310 --> 00:59:54,937
I'm proud of you, baby.

796
00:59:55,413 --> 00:59:58,075
-Thanks, Mama.
-You make your mama proud.

797
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:03,987
May I have your attention?

798
01:00:04,188 --> 01:00:07,919
The SAT test will be
administered in this room.

799
01:00:08,192 --> 01:00:12,458
When you receive your test book,
please keep it closed on your desk.

800
01:00:12,663 --> 01:00:15,826
Read the directions on the
front cover of your test book.

801
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:19,467
Use a number two pencil  in
marking your answer sheet.

802
01:00:19,703 --> 01:00:22,866
Ink or ballpoint pen
is not to be used.

803
01:00:23,607 --> 01:00:27,008
If you do not have
a number two pencil  with you...

804
01:00:27,211 --> 01:00:31,648
...raise your hand and keep it up.
We'll pass a pencil  out to you.

805
01:00:31,882 --> 01:00:36,376
During the time allotted for a section,
you may work on that section only.

806
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:39,145
If you finish a section
before time is called...

807
01:00:39,390 --> 01:00:44,157
...you may not go back to a previous
section or on to the next one.

808
01:00:44,395 --> 01:00:47,023
You have 30 minutes for section one.

809
01:00:47,565 --> 01:00:50,864
Open your test books and begin work.

810
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:51,919
-This it?
-Yeah.

811
01:02:03,474 --> 01:02:04,771
Damn!

812
01:02:05,576 --> 01:02:09,239
-Baby got more cakes than Duncan Hines!
-Damn.

813
01:02:11,315 --> 01:02:13,215
Bet you buy the chip.

814
01:02:13,484 --> 01:02:16,420
Don't worry, the interest rate hasn't
moved two percent in five years.

815
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:18,615
Don't worry, the interest rate hasn't
moved two percent in five years.

816
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:21,756
-''Furious Styles Financial.''
-Talk to you later.

817
01:02:27,898 --> 01:02:30,264
So how you guys think
you did on the test?

818
01:02:31,135 --> 01:02:33,160
All right, I guess.

819
01:02:35,573 --> 01:02:40,670
Those tests are culturally biased.
The only universal part is the math.

820
01:02:42,646 --> 01:02:46,013
You boys must be hungry.
I'm real surprised to see you.

821
01:02:46,617 --> 01:02:48,244
Came to see you.

822
01:02:48,619 --> 01:02:51,087
See how you doing.
How's business going?

823
01:02:52,189 --> 01:02:55,352
Well, there's always business,
just not always in here.

824
01:02:55,626 --> 01:02:56,854
What do you do, Furious?

825
01:02:57,494 --> 01:03:00,088
You help people get money
for homes or what?

826
01:03:01,365 --> 01:03:04,493
Well, there is no ''or what.''
That's what I do, Rick.

827
01:03:08,672 --> 01:03:11,766
-You boys want to see something?
-Do we have a choice?

828
01:03:15,546 --> 01:03:16,535
No.

829
01:03:54,418 --> 01:03:59,549
I don't know about all this.
Got us walking around Compton and all.

830
01:03:59,757 --> 01:04:02,385
Rick, it's the '90s.

831
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:05,652
We can't afford to be afraid
of our own people anymore.

832
01:04:09,233 --> 01:04:11,428
Would you two knuckleheads come on?

833
01:04:17,074 --> 01:04:20,373
I want y'all to look at that sign.
See what it says?

834
01:04:20,611 --> 01:04:24,172
''Cash for your home.''
You know what that is?

835
01:04:25,716 --> 01:04:27,274
-It's a billboard.
-billboard.

836
01:04:27,618 --> 01:04:29,279
What are y'all, Amos and Andy?

837
01:04:29,586 --> 01:04:31,383
Are you Steppin' and he's Fetchit?

838
01:04:31,689 --> 01:04:34,385
I'm talking about the message.
What it stands for.

839
01:04:35,125 --> 01:04:37,252
It's called ''gentrification.''

840
01:04:37,461 --> 01:04:41,693
It's what happens when property value
of a certain area is brought down.

841
01:04:42,966 --> 01:04:43,796
-You listening?
-Yeah.

842
01:04:44,068 --> 01:04:47,970
They bring the property value down.
They can buy the land cheaper.

843
01:04:48,272 --> 01:04:52,265
Then they move the people out, raise
the value and sell it at a profit.

844
01:04:52,609 --> 01:04:57,706
What we need to do is keep everything
in our neighborhood, everything, black.

845
01:04:58,115 --> 01:04:59,639
Black-owned with black money.

846
01:04:59,883 --> 01:05:03,717
Just like the Jews, the Italians,
the Mexicans and the Koreans do.

847
01:05:04,088 --> 01:05:07,387
Ain't nobody from outside bringing
down the property value.

848
01:05:07,624 --> 01:05:08,921
It's these folk!

849
01:05:09,727 --> 01:05:13,754
Shooting each other and selling
that crack rock and shit.

850
01:05:13,964 --> 01:05:15,989
How you think crack gets
into the country?

851
01:05:16,233 --> 01:05:20,067
We don't own any planes.
We don't own no ships.

852
01:05:20,270 --> 01:05:24,104
We are not the people who are flying
and floating that shit in here.

853
01:05:24,742 --> 01:05:28,371
Every time you turn on a TV,
that's what you see.

854
01:05:28,579 --> 01:05:32,515
Black people selling the rock,
pushing the rock. Yeah, I know.

855
01:05:32,850 --> 01:05:35,318
It wasn't a problem when it was here.

856
01:05:35,586 --> 01:05:37,747
Wasn't a problem
until it was in Iowa...

857
01:05:37,955 --> 01:05:41,152
...and on Wall Street where
there's hardly any black people.

858
01:05:41,425 --> 01:05:43,859
If you want to talk about guns...

859
01:05:44,094 --> 01:05:47,188
...why is it that there's a gun shop
on every corner here?

860
01:05:47,431 --> 01:05:49,695
-Why?
-I'll tell you why.

861
01:05:49,967 --> 01:05:54,097
Just like there's a liquor store on
every corner in the black community.

862
01:05:54,371 --> 01:05:56,532
Why? They want us to kill ourselves.

863
01:05:56,774 --> 01:05:59,675
You go out to Beverly Hills,
you don't see that shit.

864
01:05:59,877 --> 01:06:01,936
They want to us to kill ourselves.

865
01:06:02,146 --> 01:06:06,776
The best way to destroy a people is to
take away their ability to reproduce.

866
01:06:07,217 --> 01:06:11,449
Who is it that's dying out here on
these streets every night? Y'all.

867
01:06:12,689 --> 01:06:15,157
-Yeah.
-Young brothers like yourselves.

868
01:06:15,726 --> 01:06:18,786
What am I supposed to do?
Fool roll up, try to smoke me?

869
01:06:19,029 --> 01:06:22,123
I'm gonna shoot the motherfucker
if he don't kill me first.

870
01:06:22,399 --> 01:06:24,663
You doing exactly
what they want you to do.

871
01:06:24,868 --> 01:06:28,304
You have to think, young brother,
about your future.

872
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:32,508
Damn, man.
You know, Furious is deep.

873
01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:37,337
-He used to be a preacher?
-He ain't never been no preacher.

874
01:06:37,581 --> 01:06:39,378
Just reads a lot.

875
01:06:41,251 --> 01:06:43,378
My brother should've heard that, man.

876
01:06:44,188 --> 01:06:45,678
Would've done him some good.

877
01:06:45,923 --> 01:06:47,049
Where he at?

878
01:06:47,257 --> 01:06:52,024
Where else, man? Up on Crenshaw
with the rest of them fools.

879
01:06:52,262 --> 01:06:54,594
-Let's go.
-Cool.

880
01:07:20,757 --> 01:07:23,590
-What up, Monster?
-What up, nigga?

881
01:07:23,861 --> 01:07:26,022
Goddamn, there's a lot of fuckers here.

882
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:27,891
Don't be using God's name in vain.

883
01:07:28,565 --> 01:07:29,691
What?

884
01:07:29,933 --> 01:07:31,093
Man, shut up.

885
01:07:32,035 --> 01:07:33,559
Yo, man, you beileve in God?

886
01:07:34,571 --> 01:07:37,802
Yo, why the fuck y'all get
so damn rellgi-fied lately?

887
01:07:38,208 --> 01:07:39,903
Fool, I wasn't even talking to you.

888
01:07:40,143 --> 01:07:43,772
This is an A and B conversation.
You can see your way out of it.

889
01:07:43,981 --> 01:07:46,108
You can see your way out
of my ride...

890
01:07:46,383 --> 01:07:49,113
...and we'll see your crippled ass
walking home.

891
01:07:49,319 --> 01:07:52,811
Man, look. Do I beileve in God?
Yeah, I guess I do.

892
01:07:53,123 --> 01:07:56,559
How else can you have the sun, moon
and stars and shit like that?

893
01:07:56,793 --> 01:08:01,253
Sun, moon, stars, quasars.
Motherfucker sound like Elroy Jetson.

894
01:08:01,498 --> 01:08:03,125
There ain't no God.

895
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:07,894
If there was a God, why He be letting
motherfuckers get smoked every night?

896
01:08:09,573 --> 01:08:13,407
-Babies and little kids, tell me that.
-You tell me this, nigga.

897
01:08:13,644 --> 01:08:17,171
How you know God's a He? He could
be a She. You don't know that.

898
01:08:17,414 --> 01:08:21,248
For one thing, you don't know what
the fuck I be motherfucking knowing.

899
01:08:21,485 --> 01:08:23,646
I read about this shit
when I was in the pen.

900
01:08:23,854 --> 01:08:27,813
It was this book, right,
and it was telling...

901
01:08:28,091 --> 01:08:31,151
...life in the perspective
if God was a bitch.

902
01:08:31,361 --> 01:08:36,492
Said if God was a bitch, there wouldn't
be no nuclear bombs, no wars...

903
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:38,668
...because that ain't
in a bitch's nature.

904
01:08:39,202 --> 01:08:43,468
Why every time you talk about a female
you say bitch or whore or hootchie?

905
01:08:43,707 --> 01:08:46,175
-Because that's what you are.
-Nigga, fuck you.

906
01:08:55,185 --> 01:08:56,277
Hey, hey.

907
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:57,452
What's up?

908
01:08:57,688 --> 01:08:59,121
What up, D?

909
01:09:14,805 --> 01:09:18,901
-What's up, Mon?
-What's up, man? Hey, Tre.

910
01:09:22,012 --> 01:09:23,138
What's happening?

911
01:09:23,347 --> 01:09:25,645
-Where y'all coming from?
-Compton.

912
01:09:25,882 --> 01:09:27,474
What y'all doing over here, man?

913
01:09:27,684 --> 01:09:32,485
We're kicking it. Philosophizing
on God, church, bitches and all.

914
01:09:32,889 --> 01:09:36,222
I'm schooling these niggas
on the aspect of religion.

915
01:09:36,493 --> 01:09:39,519
-religion?
-And on factual, actual studies.

916
01:09:39,730 --> 01:09:41,595
You know what I'm saying?

917
01:09:41,898 --> 01:09:43,525
-Y'all coming from Compton?
-Yeah.

918
01:09:43,734 --> 01:09:48,228
-I thought you were scared of Compton.
-Rick was a shivering bitch, boy.

919
01:09:48,505 --> 01:09:51,497
It was deep, though.
You should've been there, man.

920
01:09:51,742 --> 01:09:55,041
Pops was talking, speaking, man.
Speaking the truth and shit.

921
01:09:55,345 --> 01:09:59,577
Your pops is like
motherfucking Malcolm Farrakhan.

922
01:10:13,296 --> 01:10:14,729
Man, what's wrong with you?

923
01:10:16,967 --> 01:10:18,400
Fuck you looking at, nigga?

924
01:10:18,635 --> 01:10:21,297
I'm still trying to find out, nigga!

925
01:10:22,406 --> 01:10:23,737
We got a problem here?

926
01:10:25,275 --> 01:10:28,369
We got a problem here?
We got a problem, nigga?

927
01:10:28,612 --> 01:10:30,273
-What up with this?
-Put the gun away.

928
01:10:30,547 --> 01:10:33,209
Can't we have one night
where nobody gets shot?

929
01:10:33,617 --> 01:10:34,447
Shut up, bitch.

930
01:10:35,052 --> 01:10:37,077
Bitch, I'm gonna fuck you up!

931
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:40,448
Let's get that bitch!
Fuck you like that.

932
01:10:55,806 --> 01:10:57,831
Ferris always trying
to start some shit.

933
01:10:58,408 --> 01:11:02,572
Nigga can't fight, so he always trying
to find some excuse to shoot somebody.

934
01:11:02,846 --> 01:11:05,576
That's why fool be getting
shot all the time.

935
01:11:05,782 --> 01:11:09,343
Trying to show how hard they is.
Ignorant.

936
01:11:09,619 --> 01:11:12,383
Fool, shut up.
You be doing that shit too.

937
01:11:12,589 --> 01:11:13,487
I know.

938
01:11:35,445 --> 01:11:37,436
Hey, man, come on. Let's go!

939
01:11:44,321 --> 01:11:46,551
I'm getting the fuck out of L.A.

940
01:11:47,190 --> 01:11:49,488
Fuck this shit. Fuck it.

941
01:11:50,727 --> 01:11:53,855
You can't go nowhere without
it getting all shot up and shit.

942
01:11:58,401 --> 01:11:59,459
Shit!

943
01:11:59,669 --> 01:12:01,637
Shit! Fuck!

944
01:12:08,044 --> 01:12:11,309
Driver! Put your hands
on the steering wheel!

945
01:12:30,333 --> 01:12:33,097
-Got any drugs or weapons on you?
-No.

946
01:12:36,206 --> 01:12:37,264
I didn't do nothing.

947
01:12:38,909 --> 01:12:41,036
You think you tough.

948
01:12:42,078 --> 01:12:43,943
You think you're tough, huh?

949
01:12:47,884 --> 01:12:49,784
You scared now, huh?

950
01:12:50,086 --> 01:12:54,113
I like that.
That's why I took this job.

951
01:12:54,858 --> 01:12:57,884
I hate little motherfuckers like you.

952
01:12:59,863 --> 01:13:04,095
Little niggers, you ain't shit!
Think you tough, huh?

953
01:13:05,035 --> 01:13:08,402
I could blow your head off,
and you couldn't do shit.

954
01:13:09,072 --> 01:13:11,040
How you feel now?

955
01:13:12,776 --> 01:13:13,970
What set you from?

956
01:13:14,978 --> 01:13:18,209
Look like one of them
Crenshaw Mafia motherfuckers.

957
01:13:18,615 --> 01:13:22,073
No, you probably one of them
Rolling 60s, huh?

958
01:13:24,888 --> 01:13:27,584
12-Adam-63, we have
a possible 187 in blue VW...

959
01:13:27,791 --> 01:13:30,282
...at corner of
Florence and Vermont.

960
01:13:31,895 --> 01:13:36,764
Again, a possible 187 in blue VW
at corner of Florence and Vermont.

961
01:13:36,967 --> 01:13:37,991
Stay out of trouble.

962
01:13:38,768 --> 01:13:42,329
You gentlemen have
a nice evening now, you hear?

963
01:14:13,803 --> 01:14:15,270
Hi.

964
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:21,140
-I thought something happened to you.
-Ain't nothing gonna happen to me.

965
01:14:22,545 --> 01:14:25,673
I'm tired of hearing them
shooting all the time.

966
01:14:29,719 --> 01:14:32,381
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

967
01:14:34,391 --> 01:14:37,155
I'm tired of this shit.

968
01:14:38,061 --> 01:14:40,723
Those two motherfuckers.

969
01:14:42,065 --> 01:14:44,226
I could kill all these motherfuckers.

970
01:14:44,501 --> 01:14:46,366
I'm sick and fucking
tired of this shit!

971
01:14:46,569 --> 01:14:48,332
I'm fucking sick of this shit!

972
01:14:48,571 --> 01:14:52,063
I'm so fucking tired of this shit!
Fuck this shit!

973
01:14:52,375 --> 01:14:55,902
Stupid motherfucker!
Fucking fuck you! Fuck you!

974
01:14:56,479 --> 01:15:00,074
I wish I could kill all you!
Come on at me, motherfucker!

975
01:15:45,395 --> 01:15:47,226
What's so funny?

976
01:15:49,766 --> 01:15:53,258
I never thought I'd be crying
in front of a female.

977
01:15:55,638 --> 01:15:57,902
You can cry in front of me.

978
01:16:27,103 --> 01:16:28,900
What do you think about...

979
01:16:29,139 --> 01:16:32,233
...people getting married
while they're still in college?

980
01:16:33,476 --> 01:16:35,444
Are you trying to ask me something?

981
01:16:35,745 --> 01:16:37,076
No.

982
01:16:37,814 --> 01:16:41,443
I just wanted to know what you thought
about that kind of situation.

983
01:16:43,086 --> 01:16:47,921
I think it can be good
if two people really love each other.

984
01:16:49,459 --> 01:16:50,619
Really?

985
01:16:51,428 --> 01:16:52,690
Yeah.

986
01:16:56,199 --> 01:16:58,599
You sure you're down for this?

987
01:16:59,202 --> 01:17:01,102
Yeah. Are you?

988
01:17:01,337 --> 01:17:02,531
Yeah.

989
01:17:03,206 --> 01:17:06,334
I mean, yes, I am.

990
01:17:11,681 --> 01:17:13,979
I don't want to get pregnant.

991
01:17:14,551 --> 01:17:16,041
You won't.

992
01:17:52,489 --> 01:17:54,480
Hi. I'm looking for a Miss Devereaux?

993
01:17:54,724 --> 01:17:57,158
-She's right over there.
-Thank you.

994
01:18:06,436 --> 01:18:07,403
Hey.

995
01:18:07,604 --> 01:18:08,662
Hi.

996
01:18:13,243 --> 01:18:14,710
You look nice.

997
01:18:14,911 --> 01:18:16,936
Thank you. So do you.

998
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:18,408
Thanks.

999
01:18:18,715 --> 01:18:20,114
Thanks for coming.

1000
01:18:21,284 --> 01:18:22,410
So....

1001
01:18:23,887 --> 01:18:25,354
So this is...

1002
01:18:25,588 --> 01:18:27,385
...definitely you.

1003
01:18:29,926 --> 01:18:32,190
And what's that supposed to mean?

1004
01:18:33,129 --> 01:18:35,290
I thought we were
gonna talk about Tre.

1005
01:18:37,901 --> 01:18:39,266
Espresso, please.

1006
01:18:39,469 --> 01:18:41,198
Caf au lait, please.

1007
01:18:44,707 --> 01:18:46,971
I bought him some shoes yesterday.

1008
01:18:47,577 --> 01:18:49,772
Why are you always buying him stuff?

1009
01:18:50,046 --> 01:18:52,640
Can't I be nice to my son?
Do I have that right?

1010
01:18:52,916 --> 01:18:56,818
Yes, but he has a job. You don't
have to always buy him stuff.

1011
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:58,314
Look...

1012
01:18:58,755 --> 01:19:01,280
...did he tell you he wants
to move in with Brandi?

1013
01:19:01,558 --> 01:19:03,458
Yeah. So?

1014
01:19:04,394 --> 01:19:06,259
''Yeah. So''?

1015
01:19:06,763 --> 01:19:09,493
So don't you think that's a bad idea?

1016
01:19:14,237 --> 01:19:18,799
I think that Tre is old enough
to make his own decisions, Reva.

1017
01:19:19,409 --> 01:19:23,937
You're his father. That means you
were supposed to guide his decisions.

1018
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:26,614
What have I been doing
for the last seven years?

1019
01:19:26,816 --> 01:19:29,512
-Not that, evidently.
-Listen, Reva...

1020
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:34,253
...it's time for you to let go.
I know you want to play the mommy...

1021
01:19:34,490 --> 01:19:38,290
...but Tre is a grown man now.
He's not a little boy anymore.

1022
01:19:38,494 --> 01:19:41,622
That time has passed, sweetheart.
You missed it.

1023
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,529
Excuse me, I'm getting
some cigarettes.

1024
01:19:45,768 --> 01:19:48,362
You're not getting off that easy.
Sit your ass down.

1025
01:19:49,305 --> 01:19:50,294
Excuse me?

1026
01:19:50,707 --> 01:19:55,474
I said sit down before I raise my voice
and make a fool out of both of us.

1027
01:19:56,713 --> 01:19:57,975
Okay.

1028
01:20:01,017 --> 01:20:04,976
Now it's my time to talk.

1029
01:20:05,388 --> 01:20:08,949
Of course you took in
your son, my son...

1030
01:20:09,192 --> 01:20:10,819
...our son...

1031
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:14,120
...and you taught him to be a man.
I'll give you that...

1032
01:20:14,364 --> 01:20:17,060
...because most men ain't man enough
to do what you did.

1033
01:20:17,567 --> 01:20:22,698
But that gives you no reason,
do you hear me, no reason...

1034
01:20:23,206 --> 01:20:26,733
...to tell me that I can't be
a mother to my son.

1035
01:20:27,910 --> 01:20:29,468
What you did...

1036
01:20:30,013 --> 01:20:35,007
...is no different from what mothers
have done from the beginning of time.

1037
01:20:35,251 --> 01:20:38,652
It's just too bad
more brothers won't do the same.

1038
01:20:38,855 --> 01:20:41,050
But don't think you're special.

1039
01:20:41,691 --> 01:20:45,650
You may be cute, but not special.

1040
01:20:47,597 --> 01:20:50,430
Drink your caf au lait. It's on me.

1041
01:20:54,570 --> 01:20:59,269
Everybody in the mall was running.
Bitches running out of Contempo's.

1042
01:20:59,542 --> 01:21:02,010
Fuckers throwing cookies
out the cookie shop.

1043
01:21:02,612 --> 01:21:07,345
Niggas was getting their ball on. I
was smoking every fucker that came in.

1044
01:21:07,550 --> 01:21:11,281
I thought I'd let y'all know that.
Understands me?

1045
01:21:11,487 --> 01:21:12,476
What's up?

1046
01:21:12,689 --> 01:21:16,921
You missing all the action.
Niggas getting smoked and shit.

1047
01:21:27,203 --> 01:21:28,227
Who's them niggas?

1048
01:21:28,705 --> 01:21:30,434
Man, pick Chris up.

1049
01:21:30,973 --> 01:21:32,907
Punk might start trippin'.

1050
01:21:33,142 --> 01:21:37,977
That's those fools from Crenshaw.
Damn, I ain't even got my gat.

1051
01:21:47,490 --> 01:21:49,788
Motherfucker ain't got
nothing better to do.

1052
01:21:50,059 --> 01:21:53,290
Twenty-seven years old. Still
fucking motherfuckers our age...

1053
01:21:53,563 --> 01:21:55,292
...with his old ass.

1054
01:21:55,598 --> 01:21:56,656
What's up?

1055
01:21:56,899 --> 01:21:58,230
Anyway...

1056
01:21:58,434 --> 01:22:02,666
...I saw you roll out of Brandi crib
at 2 in the motherfucking morning.

1057
01:22:02,939 --> 01:22:05,305
Yo, man, that's my business.

1058
01:22:06,342 --> 01:22:07,604
Handle your shit, G.

1059
01:22:07,844 --> 01:22:10,335
-Peer pressure, man.
-Handle your shit.

1060
01:22:10,780 --> 01:22:12,475
Don't be like this motherfucker.

1061
01:22:12,782 --> 01:22:16,775
This motherfucker got babies,
in-house pussy.

1062
01:22:16,986 --> 01:22:19,113
Let me do shit like that,
Ma would be like:

1063
01:22:19,422 --> 01:22:20,855
''I ain't having it.''

1064
01:22:22,091 --> 01:22:23,285
Ricky.

1065
01:22:24,093 --> 01:22:25,355
Ricky!

1066
01:22:26,329 --> 01:22:27,626
You know you heard me.

1067
01:22:27,864 --> 01:22:29,354
Huh? What?

1068
01:22:29,632 --> 01:22:31,623
I need you to go get some cornmeal.

1069
01:22:31,934 --> 01:22:34,129
Yeah. I'll go in a little while.

1070
01:22:36,806 --> 01:22:41,368
If you want to land a good job, you
have to know what most employers want.

1071
01:22:42,178 --> 01:22:45,614
Like how to motivate yourself.
How to lead others.

1072
01:22:45,848 --> 01:22:48,043
How to perform under pressure.

1073
01:22:48,317 --> 01:22:53,016
You can learn these things in the Army.
No matter what career you choose...

1074
01:22:53,222 --> 01:22:57,022
...you'll really be ready
to take off.

1075
01:22:59,562 --> 01:23:01,359
Ricky, get up and go now.

1076
01:23:01,564 --> 01:23:03,964
I can't finish
frying the fish without it.

1077
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:07,294
Boy, go get this girl some cornmeal.

1078
01:23:07,970 --> 01:23:10,905
You ought to be happy
somebody's cooking for your ass.

1079
01:23:11,174 --> 01:23:13,699
-Give me some, Dook.
-Here, take it.

1080
01:23:13,910 --> 01:23:15,400
-What's up?
-What's happening?

1081
01:23:15,678 --> 01:23:18,306
D, go to the store for me
and get some cornmeal?

1082
01:23:18,514 --> 01:23:22,575
Nigga, I ain't the one she told
to go get it. She's your wife.

1083
01:23:22,852 --> 01:23:24,547
She ain't my wife, man.

1084
01:23:24,821 --> 01:23:26,254
Shit.

1085
01:23:26,522 --> 01:23:28,922
Might as well be,
y'all got a family and shit.

1086
01:23:29,192 --> 01:23:31,854
Tecmo Bowl-playing motherfucker.

1087
01:23:32,228 --> 01:23:34,162
Fuck you, man.
Go to the store with me.

1088
01:23:34,363 --> 01:23:35,660
Sure, let's do it.

1089
01:23:35,898 --> 01:23:36,990
What?

1090
01:23:37,767 --> 01:23:40,998
Don't fuck me, fuck your wife.
That's why you got a baby.

1091
01:23:41,204 --> 01:23:43,365
You better get out
of my face, all right?

1092
01:23:44,073 --> 01:23:45,836
What's up with Brandi?

1093
01:23:46,108 --> 01:23:49,373
-Hey, you a punk, man!
-Hey, yo, yo. Wait a minute.

1094
01:23:49,579 --> 01:23:50,443
Wait!

1095
01:23:50,646 --> 01:23:52,773
This is family business.
Let 'em fight.

1096
01:23:53,015 --> 01:23:56,007
Y'all are brothers!
You ain't supposed to be fighting.

1097
01:23:56,285 --> 01:23:58,549
You been a punk from day one.
Mama's boy!

1098
01:23:58,821 --> 01:24:00,345
Get him, Dough.

1099
01:24:02,391 --> 01:24:03,449
Let 'em fight, man.

1100
01:24:04,293 --> 01:24:07,228
Brenda, Ricky and Doughboy
are out here fighting.

1101
01:24:08,197 --> 01:24:10,028
Cut that out. Get off of him.

1102
01:24:10,233 --> 01:24:12,201
Get off of him!

1103
01:24:12,735 --> 01:24:13,895
Damn.

1104
01:24:14,637 --> 01:24:16,229
-What you hit me for?
-You all right?

1105
01:24:16,506 --> 01:24:19,134
Yeah, I'm all right.
I'm all right!

1106
01:24:25,548 --> 01:24:26,913
What you hit me for?

1107
01:24:27,149 --> 01:24:29,379
It's the test scores. Ricky!

1108
01:24:29,652 --> 01:24:32,246
Ricky, baby, your test scores!

1109
01:24:32,755 --> 01:24:34,347
What you hit me for?

1110
01:24:35,258 --> 01:24:37,055
Why you hitting me?

1111
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:40,253
Yo, Dough. Why she hit you?

1112
01:24:40,530 --> 01:24:42,088
Shut up, man.

1113
01:24:42,598 --> 01:24:45,692
Fuck all that shit.
I'm going into the fucking Army.

1114
01:24:45,902 --> 01:24:48,735
-That's all there is to say.
-You're doing what?

1115
01:24:48,938 --> 01:24:50,872
Man, what are you, a damn fool?

1116
01:24:51,073 --> 01:24:53,564
They say I can learn
to work on computers.

1117
01:24:53,843 --> 01:24:56,243
Plus, they'll give me
money for college.

1118
01:24:57,880 --> 01:25:00,542
Listen to you.
You sound like the commercial.

1119
01:25:00,783 --> 01:25:03,775
They don't tell you that
you don't belong to you no more.

1120
01:25:04,086 --> 01:25:07,078
You belong to them, the government.

1121
01:25:07,290 --> 01:25:09,451
Like a slave or something.

1122
01:25:09,725 --> 01:25:11,886
My daddy told me a black man...

1123
01:25:12,094 --> 01:25:15,257
...has got no business, no place
in the white man's Army.

1124
01:25:15,531 --> 01:25:17,294
I heard all that.

1125
01:25:17,533 --> 01:25:19,433
I got a little boy
to think about, okay?

1126
01:25:19,702 --> 01:25:23,570
I don't want to be like my brother.
Hanging out and not doing shit.

1127
01:25:23,773 --> 01:25:26,105
End up dealing 'caine, just like him.

1128
01:25:26,943 --> 01:25:30,538
I want to do something with my life.
I want to be somebody.

1129
01:25:30,746 --> 01:25:32,907
Listen, let me tell you something.

1130
01:25:33,149 --> 01:25:35,913
When you join that Army,
you ain't gonna be nobody.

1131
01:25:41,457 --> 01:25:42,788
Yo, you got any change?

1132
01:25:43,059 --> 01:25:45,084
No, I ain't got no change. See?

1133
01:25:45,761 --> 01:25:47,160
What up?

1134
01:25:53,569 --> 01:25:55,503
Yo, chief. Here you go.

1135
01:25:57,473 --> 01:25:59,407
Hey, no problem, bro.

1136
01:26:02,244 --> 01:26:03,836
You win anything?

1137
01:26:05,247 --> 01:26:07,772
Wait a minute, man.
I'm still trying to find out.

1138
01:26:11,954 --> 01:26:14,286
Shit. Nothing.

1139
01:26:15,491 --> 01:26:18,016
-What?
-I said nothing. I didn't win.

1140
01:26:18,294 --> 01:26:20,319
You gotta be Mexican
to win that shit.

1141
01:26:20,596 --> 01:26:24,623
Man, I win this lottery, I won't
have to worry about a damn thing.

1142
01:26:24,834 --> 01:26:29,897
Don't have to worry about no colleges,
no 700 on no SATs. Not a damn--

1143
01:26:30,106 --> 01:26:31,368
Look.

1144
01:26:35,711 --> 01:26:38,111
There's that motherfucker
from the other night.

1145
01:26:39,148 --> 01:26:43,346
Okay. When I say ''cut,''
we'll cut through these houses.

1146
01:26:45,621 --> 01:26:46,645
Cut!

1147
01:26:47,823 --> 01:26:48,653
Punk ass.

1148
01:26:48,858 --> 01:26:50,519
Get him, man, get him!

1149
01:26:50,793 --> 01:26:51,782
Let's get him.

1150
01:26:51,994 --> 01:26:54,690
Go around the corner.
Cut 'em off. Come on, go!

1151
01:26:56,232 --> 01:26:57,392
Shit.

1152
01:26:57,900 --> 01:26:59,333
Fucking mangy mutts!

1153
01:26:59,535 --> 01:27:00,365
Come on.

1154
01:27:00,636 --> 01:27:02,399
I got you. I got you.

1155
01:27:03,506 --> 01:27:05,167
-Come on, let's go.
-Hold on, man.

1156
01:27:06,409 --> 01:27:08,843
-What are you doing?
-I gotta drain the weasel.

1157
01:27:12,081 --> 01:27:17,212
If that motherfucker roll up on the set
one more time, I'll blast his ass.

1158
01:27:21,657 --> 01:27:23,488
Shit! Rick!

1159
01:27:25,361 --> 01:27:27,420
What a relief and shit.

1160
01:27:28,564 --> 01:27:31,055
-Let's go.
-Wait a minute. Let's split up.

1161
01:27:31,267 --> 01:27:33,098
I don't think we should do that.

1162
01:27:33,369 --> 01:27:36,270
I think it'd be better
if we're together.

1163
01:27:36,539 --> 01:27:40,168
Them fools ain't gonna do nothing.
They just showing out and shit.

1164
01:27:42,712 --> 01:27:45,772
-I'll meet you at your house.
-Cool. I'm out of here.

1165
01:27:49,251 --> 01:27:50,912
Come on, man.

1166
01:28:27,389 --> 01:28:28,822
Ricky!

1167
01:29:06,796 --> 01:29:08,161
Ricky.

1168
01:29:10,366 --> 01:29:14,200
Help me! Help me!
Somebody help me!

1169
01:29:15,137 --> 01:29:16,536
Ricky!

1170
01:29:20,276 --> 01:29:21,368
Shit!

1171
01:29:34,957 --> 01:29:38,188
Watch his head. Don't hurt him.

1172
01:29:39,962 --> 01:29:41,793
Don't hurt him, man.

1173
01:29:45,067 --> 01:29:46,967
Be careful with him.

1174
01:29:59,748 --> 01:30:01,340
Watch his head.

1175
01:30:01,750 --> 01:30:03,217
He's dead.

1176
01:30:04,887 --> 01:30:06,582
Let's take him home.

1177
01:30:35,217 --> 01:30:36,411
Mama!

1178
01:30:42,224 --> 01:30:43,452
Mama!

1179
01:30:43,959 --> 01:30:45,221
Mama!

1180
01:30:50,232 --> 01:30:51,597
No!

1181
01:30:54,770 --> 01:30:59,434
Ricky! Oh, my God, no!
Not Ricky!

1182
01:31:02,144 --> 01:31:04,135
What y'all doing now?

1183
01:31:05,381 --> 01:31:06,609
Ricky?

1184
01:31:07,416 --> 01:31:08,713
Oh, my God.

1185
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:14,311
Ricky? Ricky, baby, get up.

1186
01:31:15,791 --> 01:31:17,918
Get up. Wake up, baby.

1187
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:20,458
Ricky, get up. Get up.

1188
01:31:20,729 --> 01:31:21,957
It's all right. Get up, baby.

1189
01:31:22,231 --> 01:31:23,493
Get up. Tre, what happened?

1190
01:31:24,233 --> 01:31:25,564
What happened to him?

1191
01:31:27,336 --> 01:31:28,963
Give me the baby. Give me the baby!

1192
01:31:29,271 --> 01:31:31,899
Don't touch him!
Don't you ever touch him!

1193
01:31:32,141 --> 01:31:34,575
He don't need to be seeing this!

1194
01:31:34,777 --> 01:31:37,302
Ricky, please wake up!

1195
01:31:38,781 --> 01:31:39,975
Mom.

1196
01:31:40,516 --> 01:31:43,679
-What did you do? What did you do?
-It wasn't my fault.

1197
01:31:43,953 --> 01:31:46,581
-What did you do?
-Mama, I didn't do nothing.

1198
01:31:49,658 --> 01:31:52,286
Oh, my God! What did you do to him?

1199
01:31:53,195 --> 01:31:54,685
What did you do?

1200
01:31:54,964 --> 01:31:59,799
What did you do? You did this!
You did this! I'll kill you!

1201
01:32:00,002 --> 01:32:05,167
You did it! I know you did it!
You did it! Yes, you did!

1202
01:32:12,147 --> 01:32:14,172
I told you!

1203
01:32:18,654 --> 01:32:21,452
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1204
01:32:21,657 --> 01:32:23,318
Oh, my God!

1205
01:32:23,525 --> 01:32:26,119
Ricky, baby! Ricky!

1206
01:32:27,396 --> 01:32:30,229
Meet me at my house in five minutes.

1207
01:32:40,676 --> 01:32:42,803
Tre, what happened?

1208
01:32:43,045 --> 01:32:45,741
-Talk to me. What happened?
-Go home.

1209
01:32:45,981 --> 01:32:47,972
-What happened to Ricky?
-Go home.

1210
01:32:49,218 --> 01:32:51,083
Talk to him.
Something happened to Rick!

1211
01:32:51,353 --> 01:32:54,379
I don't know. He just got shot.
Something happened to Rick!

1212
01:32:54,690 --> 01:32:59,252
Brandi, I want you to calm down and
I want you to go home. You hear me?

1213
01:32:59,528 --> 01:33:01,723
-You hear me?
-Yes.

1214
01:33:05,334 --> 01:33:08,030
I'll take care of him.
He'll be all right.

1215
01:33:15,344 --> 01:33:17,175
Tre, what are you doing?

1216
01:33:26,288 --> 01:33:28,415
Oh, you bad, now, huh?

1217
01:33:28,891 --> 01:33:31,758
You bad. You gotta shoot
somebody now, huh?

1218
01:33:33,028 --> 01:33:34,689
Well, here I am.

1219
01:33:35,931 --> 01:33:37,091
Come on, shoot me.

1220
01:33:39,568 --> 01:33:41,126
You bad, right?

1221
01:33:45,574 --> 01:33:47,405
Look, I'm sorry about your friend.

1222
01:33:48,210 --> 01:33:51,373
My heart goes out to his family,
but that's their problem.

1223
01:33:51,613 --> 01:33:54,104
You my son. You my problem.

1224
01:33:56,085 --> 01:33:58,280
I want you to give me the gun.

1225
01:34:03,926 --> 01:34:07,327
I see. You want to end up
like little Chris in a wheelchair?

1226
01:34:07,596 --> 01:34:12,124
Right? No, no, you want to end up
like Doughboy, huh? No?

1227
01:34:12,901 --> 01:34:16,234
Give me the motherfucking gun, Tre!

1228
01:34:39,361 --> 01:34:43,263
You're my only son, and I'm not gonna
lose you to no bullshit, you hear?

1229
01:34:45,767 --> 01:34:47,496
I love you, man.

1230
01:34:58,514 --> 01:35:00,379
Go clean yourself up.

1231
01:35:02,451 --> 01:35:03,713
Go on.

1232
01:35:40,355 --> 01:35:41,583
Tre.

1233
01:35:42,257 --> 01:35:43,588
Tre!

1234
01:35:49,765 --> 01:35:50,925
Damn.

1235
01:35:55,170 --> 01:35:56,603
Shit!

1236
01:36:36,912 --> 01:36:38,038
Yeah.

1237
01:36:51,627 --> 01:36:52,651
Let me out.

1238
01:37:02,271 --> 01:37:03,670
Dough...

1239
01:37:04,906 --> 01:37:06,339
...let me out.

1240
01:37:55,991 --> 01:38:00,553
Where these motherfuckers at, man?
Been out here damn near three hours.

1241
01:38:00,862 --> 01:38:03,660
It's colder than a motherfucker
out here too.

1242
01:38:04,566 --> 01:38:05,897
Let's go eat.

1243
01:38:06,802 --> 01:38:08,030
Cool.

1244
01:38:12,207 --> 01:38:17,008
When you gonna get your hair cut?
It look like something from 1983.

1245
01:38:17,245 --> 01:38:18,872
Ain't nobody cutting my hair.

1246
01:38:19,081 --> 01:38:21,481
I'm like Samson.
My strength is in my head.

1247
01:38:22,150 --> 01:38:24,550
What's up with the babe
you been talking to?

1248
01:38:24,820 --> 01:38:26,412
-Fuck that bitch.
-You scared?

1249
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:29,748
-He ain't scared, he just young.
-And dumb.

1250
01:38:30,258 --> 01:38:32,226
I'm putting ketchup on this.

1251
01:38:32,494 --> 01:38:34,086
Why you put all that ketchup on it?

1252
01:38:34,363 --> 01:38:37,696
Why you worried about it, fool?
These my fries.

1253
01:38:42,404 --> 01:38:44,565
We going to see your girl?

1254
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:47,104
No, I'm going to see my girl.
You going home.

1255
01:38:47,342 --> 01:38:49,333
There they go, right there.

1256
01:38:49,845 --> 01:38:51,608
Turn off the lights.

1257
01:38:52,381 --> 01:38:54,110
Hit the lights, nigga.

1258
01:38:54,616 --> 01:38:56,675
Take your ass home
and watch some videos.

1259
01:38:56,918 --> 01:38:58,613
Home with your mama.

1260
01:39:04,926 --> 01:39:06,860
Check that motherfucker out.

1261
01:39:10,966 --> 01:39:12,456
Let's get the fuck out of here!

1262
01:39:13,368 --> 01:39:15,029
Don't follow me. Go your own way.

1263
01:39:27,449 --> 01:39:30,043
-What the fuck?
-What the fuck you doing?

1264
01:39:30,285 --> 01:39:32,810
This motherfucker's crazy!

1265
01:39:33,088 --> 01:39:36,489
Goddamn, man. And I'm on parole.
Ain't this about a bitch!

1266
01:39:36,758 --> 01:39:38,157
What the fuck you doing?

1267
01:39:39,060 --> 01:39:40,493
Shit!

1268
01:39:40,729 --> 01:39:42,924
Yo, Dough. Let's ball, man.

1269
01:39:43,165 --> 01:39:45,099
-Let's go, man!
-Come on, nigga, now!

1270
01:39:46,968 --> 01:39:48,629
Man, what the fuck?

1271
01:39:50,238 --> 01:39:52,001
Oh, shit!

1272
01:39:52,274 --> 01:39:55,675
Let's get the fuck out of here.
Let's go, man. Let's go!

1273
01:40:01,650 --> 01:40:03,174
Fuck you, man!

1274
01:40:03,418 --> 01:40:05,283
Fuck you!

1275
01:40:07,355 --> 01:40:09,323
Turn your punk ass over.

1276
01:40:15,497 --> 01:40:19,297
I didn't do it, man.
I didn't pull the fucking trigger.

1277
01:40:20,101 --> 01:40:21,966
What the fuck you doing?

1278
01:40:22,204 --> 01:40:23,831
Come on, man.

1279
01:40:24,039 --> 01:40:25,301
Well, fuck you!

1280
01:40:30,178 --> 01:40:31,941
Dough, let's ball, man.

1281
01:40:32,147 --> 01:40:33,341
Man, let's move!

1282
01:40:33,548 --> 01:40:35,482
-Let's go!
-What the fuck you doing?

1283
01:40:35,684 --> 01:40:38,016
-Let's ball, man!
-Let's go, man!

1284
01:40:38,286 --> 01:40:40,516
Come on, nigga, let's ball!

1285
01:40:42,891 --> 01:40:44,449
Damn! Come on!

1286
01:40:45,527 --> 01:40:47,995
Shit, let's get out of here.

1287
01:40:48,196 --> 01:40:50,494
Here come the fucking police.

1288
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:53,627
Get your ass in.

1289
01:43:28,690 --> 01:43:30,214
What's up?

1290
01:43:30,458 --> 01:43:31,686
What's up?

1291
01:43:36,164 --> 01:43:37,995
Yo, cuz.

1292
01:43:39,134 --> 01:43:42,365
I know why you got
out of the car last night.

1293
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:46,466
You shouldn't have been there
in the first place.

1294
01:43:47,208 --> 01:43:50,041
You don't want that shit
to come back to haunt you.

1295
01:43:55,517 --> 01:43:58,645
I ain't been up this early
in a long time.

1296
01:44:03,091 --> 01:44:05,218
Turned on the TV this morning.

1297
01:44:07,729 --> 01:44:09,856
Had this shit on about...

1298
01:44:10,699 --> 01:44:14,430
...how we're living
in a violent world.

1299
01:44:16,671 --> 01:44:19,265
Showed all these foreign places.

1300
01:44:20,842 --> 01:44:22,935
How foreigners live and all.

1301
01:44:25,113 --> 01:44:27,581
I started thinking, man.

1302
01:44:30,251 --> 01:44:32,378
Either they don't know...

1303
01:44:33,722 --> 01:44:35,519
...don't show...

1304
01:44:37,625 --> 01:44:40,526
...or don't care about
what's going on in the 'hood.

1305
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:48,132
They had all this foreign shit.

1306
01:44:49,104 --> 01:44:51,538
They didn't have shit
on my brother, man.

1307
01:45:01,049 --> 01:45:03,279
I ain't got no brother.

1308
01:45:15,997 --> 01:45:18,090
Got no mother, neither.

1309
01:45:21,669 --> 01:45:24,502
She loved that fool
more than she love me.

1310
01:45:24,973 --> 01:45:26,497
Doughboy.

1311
01:45:27,308 --> 01:45:29,299
You got some blow? Got some rock?

1312
01:45:29,577 --> 01:45:31,636
Get the fuck out of my face!

1313
01:45:33,915 --> 01:45:37,009
Keep them goddamn babies
out the street.

1314
01:45:40,922 --> 01:45:42,651
Did y'all get 'em?

1315
01:45:54,435 --> 01:45:57,700
I don't even know
how I feel about it neither, man.

1316
01:45:59,774 --> 01:46:02,709
Shit just goes on and on, you know.

1317
01:46:05,013 --> 01:46:08,141
Next thing you know,
somebody might try to smoke me.

1318
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:14,381
Don't matter, though.

1319
01:46:16,724 --> 01:46:19,386
We all gotta go sometime, huh?

1320
01:46:23,164 --> 01:46:27,897
Seem like they punched
the wrong clock on Rick, though.

1321
01:46:31,406 --> 01:46:32,703
Yeah.

1322
01:46:34,809 --> 01:46:36,868
I gotta go, cuz.

1323
01:46:40,215 --> 01:46:41,546
Hey, Dough.

1324
01:46:43,818 --> 01:46:45,080
What's up?

1325
01:46:51,993 --> 01:46:54,154
You still got one brother left, man.

1326
01:46:55,496 --> 01:46:57,259
Thanks, man.

1327
01:47:01,336 --> 01:47:02,496
-Later, G.
-Later.
