1
00:01:47,443 --> 00:01:49,323
Mr. Dufresne, describe...

2
00:01:49,523 --> 00:01:53,683
...the confrontation you had with
your wife the night she was murdered.

3
00:01:58,162 --> 00:01:59,762
It was very bitter.

4
00:02:00,082 --> 00:02:04,242
She said she was glad I knew,
that she hated all the sneaking around.

5
00:02:05,722 --> 00:02:09,081
And she said that she wanted
a divorce in Reno.

6
00:02:09,322 --> 00:02:12,801
-What was your response?
-I told her I would not grant one.

7
00:02:13,001 --> 00:02:16,041
"I'll see you in hell
before I see you in Reno."

8
00:02:16,241 --> 00:02:19,441
Those were your words,
according to your neighbors.

9
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,041
If they say so.

10
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,961
I really don't remember.
I was upset.

11
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,560
What happened after you argued
with your wife?

12
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:30,360
She packed a bag.

13
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,520
She packed a bag to go
and stay with Mr. Quentin.

14
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,039
Glenn Quentin, golf pro
at the Snowden Hills Country Club...

15
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,239
...whom you had discovered
was your wife 's lover.

16
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,599
Did you follow her?

17
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,919
I went to a few bars first.

18
00:02:49,118 --> 00:02:53,318
Later, I drove to his house
to confront them. They weren't home.

19
00:02:53,838 --> 00:02:55,318
I parked in the turnout...

20
00:02:55,998 --> 00:02:56,918
...and waited.

21
00:02:57,158 --> 00:02:58,717
With what intention?

22
00:02:59,318 --> 00:03:00,677
I'm not sure.

23
00:03:01,798 --> 00:03:03,198
I was confused...

24
00:03:03,397 --> 00:03:04,397
...drunk.

25
00:03:05,838 --> 00:03:07,078
I think...

26
00:03:07,277 --> 00:03:09,278
...mostly I wanted to scare them.

27
00:03:09,517 --> 00:03:12,797
When they arrived, you went up
to the house and murdered them.

28
00:03:13,676 --> 00:03:14,997
I was sobering up.

29
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:18,717
I got back in the car
and I drove home to sleep it off.

30
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:21,757
Along the way, I threw my gun
into the Royal River.

31
00:03:21,956 --> 00:03:23,836
I've been very clear on this point.

32
00:03:24,076 --> 00:03:27,996
I get hazy where the cleaning woman
shows up the following morning...

33
00:03:28,196 --> 00:03:30,675
...and finds your wife in bed
with her lover...

34
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,875
...riddled with .38-caliber bullets.

35
00:03:34,195 --> 00:03:38,235
Does that strike you as a
fantastic coincidence, or is it just me?

36
00:03:39,075 --> 00:03:40,035
Yes, it does.

37
00:03:40,235 --> 00:03:43,275
Yet you still maintain
you threw your gun into the river...

38
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:45,434
...before the murders took place.

39
00:03:45,634 --> 00:03:47,794
That's very convenient.

40
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,594
It's the truth.

41
00:03:49,954 --> 00:03:54,314
The police dragged that river for
three days, and nary a gun was found...

42
00:03:54,514 --> 00:03:58,433
...so no comparison could be made
between your gun and the bullets...

43
00:03:58,634 --> 00:04:01,953
...taken from the bloodstained corpses
of the victims.

44
00:04:02,593 --> 00:04:04,873
And that also...

45
00:04:05,313 --> 00:04:08,633
...is very convenient.
Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?

46
00:04:09,912 --> 00:04:11,872
Since I am innocent of this crime...

47
00:04:12,073 --> 00:04:16,512
...I find it decidedly inconvenient
that the gun was never found.

48
00:04:33,671 --> 00:04:36,911
Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard
all the evidence.

49
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,790
We have the accused at the scene
of the crime. We have footprints.

50
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,710
Bullets on the ground
bearing his fingerprints.

51
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,750
A broken bourbon bottle,
likewise with fingerprints.

52
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:48,469
And most of all...

53
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:51,590
...we have a beautiful young woman
and her lover...

54
00:04:51,789 --> 00:04:53,749
...lying dead in each other's arms.

55
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,389
They had sinned.

56
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:00,948
But was their crime so great...

57
00:05:01,228 --> 00:05:03,349
...as to merit a death sentence?

58
00:05:03,548 --> 00:05:05,748
While you think about that...

59
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:08,828
...think about this:

60
00:05:09,668 --> 00:05:13,267
A revolver holds six bullets, not eight.

61
00:05:13,468 --> 00:05:16,987
I submit that this was not
a hot-blooded crime of passion.

62
00:05:17,188 --> 00:05:19,867
That at least could be understood,
if not condoned.

63
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:21,068
No.

64
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:22,347
This was revenge...

65
00:05:22,547 --> 00:05:26,787
...of a much more brutal,
cold-blooded nature. Consider this:

66
00:05:26,986 --> 00:05:29,267
Four bullets per victim.

67
00:05:29,987 --> 00:05:31,666
Not six shots fired, but eight.

68
00:05:32,147 --> 00:05:35,586
That means that he fired
the gun empty...

69
00:05:35,826 --> 00:05:37,666
...and then stopped to reload...

70
00:05:37,906 --> 00:05:41,226
...so that he could shoot
each of them again.

71
00:05:41,426 --> 00:05:43,865
An extra bullet per lover...

72
00:05:44,626 --> 00:05:46,306
...right in the head.

73
00:05:49,665 --> 00:05:54,265
You strike me as a particularly icy
and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.

74
00:05:54,665 --> 00:05:56,705
It chills my blood just to look at you.

75
00:05:58,584 --> 00:06:01,224
By the power vested in me
by the state of Maine...

76
00:06:01,424 --> 00:06:05,504
...I hereby order you to serve
two life sentences back-to-back...

77
00:06:05,864 --> 00:06:08,263
...one for each of your victims.
So be it!

78
00:06:32,382 --> 00:06:33,501
Sit.

79
00:06:37,862 --> 00:06:40,581
We see you've served
20 years of a life sentence?

80
00:06:41,461 --> 00:06:44,541
-Yes, sir.
-You feel you've been rehabilitated?

81
00:06:44,941 --> 00:06:47,421
Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

82
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:50,420
I mean, I learned my lesson.

83
00:06:51,461 --> 00:06:54,741
I can honestly say
that I'm a changed man.

84
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,140
I'm no longer a danger to society.

85
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,220
That's God's honest truth.

86
00:07:37,017 --> 00:07:38,257
Hey, Red.

87
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:39,697
How'd it go?

88
00:07:39,896 --> 00:07:41,976
Same old shit, different day.

89
00:07:42,257 --> 00:07:44,016
Yeah, I know how you feel.

90
00:07:44,217 --> 00:07:46,136
I'm up for rejection next week.

91
00:07:46,896 --> 00:07:49,296
Yeah, I got rejected last week.

92
00:07:49,496 --> 00:07:50,736
It happens.

93
00:07:50,936 --> 00:07:52,336
Hey, Red, bump me a deck.

94
00:07:52,496 --> 00:07:55,655
Get out of my face, man!
You're into me for five packs already.

95
00:07:55,896 --> 00:07:56,816
Four!

96
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:01,215
There must be a con like me
in every prison in America.

97
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:03,135
I'm the guy who can get it for you.

98
00:08:03,335 --> 00:08:06,295
Cigarettes, a bag of reefer,
if that's your thing...

99
00:08:06,494 --> 00:08:09,775
...bottle of brandy to celebrate
your kid's high school graduation.

100
00:08:09,975 --> 00:08:12,014
Damn near anything within reason.

101
00:08:12,215 --> 00:08:15,814
Yes, sir!
I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.

102
00:08:18,614 --> 00:08:21,453
So when Andy Dufresne
came to me in 1949...

103
00:08:21,614 --> 00:08:25,053
...and asked me to smuggle
Rita Hayworth into the prison for him...

104
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,413
...I told him, "No problem. "

105
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,650
Andy came to Shawshank Prison...

106
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,569
...in early 1947 for murdering his wife
and the fella she was banging.

107
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:17,809
On the outside, he'd been vice president
of a large Portland bank.

108
00:09:18,249 --> 00:09:19,970
Good work for a man so young.

109
00:10:01,446 --> 00:10:03,126
You speak English, butt-steak?

110
00:10:03,327 --> 00:10:05,086
You follow this officer.

111
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:21,405
I never seen such a sorry-looking
heap of maggot shit in all my life.

112
00:10:21,645 --> 00:10:24,125
Hey, fish! Come over here!

113
00:10:46,443 --> 00:10:47,802
Taking bets today, Red?

114
00:10:48,163 --> 00:10:49,763
Smokes or coin? Bettor's choice.

115
00:10:49,963 --> 00:10:51,603
Smokes. Put me down for two.

116
00:10:52,123 --> 00:10:53,602
All right, who's your horse?

117
00:10:53,803 --> 00:10:55,482
That little sack of shit.

118
00:10:57,042 --> 00:11:00,162
-Eighth. He'll be first.
-Bullshit! I'll take that action.

119
00:11:00,362 --> 00:11:02,481
You're out some smokes, son.

120
00:11:02,682 --> 00:11:04,362
If you're so smart, you call it.

121
00:11:04,602 --> 00:11:07,522
I'll take that chubby fat-ass there.

122
00:11:07,721 --> 00:11:10,201
The fifth one.
Put me down for a quarter deck.

123
00:11:13,281 --> 00:11:14,921
Fresh fish today!

124
00:11:15,681 --> 00:11:17,081
We're reeling them in!

125
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,241
I admit I didn't think much of Andy
first time I laid eyes on him.

126
00:11:21,761 --> 00:11:24,520
Looked like a stiff breeze
would blow him over.

127
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,879
That was my first impression of the man.

128
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,480
What do you say?

129
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,800
That tall drink of water
with the silver spoon up his ass.

130
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:34,039
That guy? Never happen.

131
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,439
-1 0 cigarettes.
-That's a rich bet.

132
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:38,599
Who's going to prove me wrong?

133
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,519
Heywood? Jigger?

134
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:42,039
Skeets?

135
00:11:42,238 --> 00:11:43,519
Floyd!

136
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:46,398
Four brave souls.

137
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:49,238
Return to your cellblocks
for evening count.

138
00:11:49,438 --> 00:11:52,598
All prisoners,
return to your cellblocks.

139
00:12:12,156 --> 00:12:13,236
Turn to the right!

140
00:12:13,436 --> 00:12:14,676
Eyes front.

141
00:12:27,235 --> 00:12:29,715
This is Mr. Hadley.
He's captain of the guards.

142
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,955
I'm Mr. Norton, the warden.

143
00:12:32,155 --> 00:12:34,235
You are convicted felons.

144
00:12:34,555 --> 00:12:36,434
That's why they've sent you to me.

145
00:12:36,994 --> 00:12:38,354
Rule number one:

146
00:12:38,555 --> 00:12:39,955
No blasphemy.

147
00:12:40,475 --> 00:12:43,754
I'll not have the Lord's name
taken in vain in my prison.

148
00:12:43,954 --> 00:12:45,074
The other rules...

149
00:12:45,274 --> 00:12:48,434
...you'll figure out as you go along.
Any questions?

150
00:12:48,794 --> 00:12:49,834
When do we eat?

151
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:00,073
You eat when we say you eat.

152
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:03,432
You shit when we say you shit,
and piss when we say you piss.

153
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:06,352
You got that,
you maggot-dick motherfucker?

154
00:13:08,152 --> 00:13:09,433
On your feet.

155
00:13:09,632 --> 00:13:11,312
I believe in two things:

156
00:13:11,513 --> 00:13:13,912
Discipline and the Bible.

157
00:13:14,392 --> 00:13:16,351
Here, you'll receive both.

158
00:13:17,112 --> 00:13:19,152
Put your trust in the Lord.

159
00:13:19,712 --> 00:13:21,871
Your ass belongs to me.

160
00:13:23,671 --> 00:13:25,471
Welcome to Shawshank.

161
00:13:30,431 --> 00:13:31,751
Unhook them.

162
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,270
Turn around.

163
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,190
That's enough.

164
00:13:47,069 --> 00:13:48,989
Move to the end of the cage.

165
00:13:49,949 --> 00:13:52,389
Turn around. Delouse him.

166
00:13:54,429 --> 00:13:55,629
Turn around.

167
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:00,948
Move out of the cage.
Pick up your clothes and Bible.

168
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:02,428
Next man up!

169
00:14:04,628 --> 00:14:06,028
To the right.

170
00:14:06,228 --> 00:14:07,228
Right. Right.

171
00:14:07,788 --> 00:14:08,948
Left.

172
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:12,987
The first night's the toughest.
No doubt about it.

173
00:14:13,427 --> 00:14:16,427
They march you in
naked as the day you were born...

174
00:14:16,627 --> 00:14:20,267
...skin burning and half-blind
from that delousing shit.

175
00:14:20,907 --> 00:14:23,187
And when they put you in that cell...

176
00:14:23,386 --> 00:14:25,626
...and those bars slam home...

177
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:28,186
...that's when you know it's for real.

178
00:14:28,786 --> 00:14:31,666
Old life blown away
in the blink of an eye.

179
00:14:32,146 --> 00:14:36,066
Nothing left but all the time
in the world to think about it.

180
00:14:37,105 --> 00:14:40,346
Most new fish come close to madness
the first night.

181
00:14:40,665 --> 00:14:43,505
Somebody always breaks down crying.

182
00:14:43,985 --> 00:14:45,545
Happens every time.

183
00:14:46,425 --> 00:14:48,145
The only question is...

184
00:14:48,344 --> 00:14:50,024
...who's it going to be?

185
00:14:51,384 --> 00:14:54,225
It's as good a thing
to bet on as any, I guess.

186
00:14:55,224 --> 00:14:57,784
I had my money on Andy Dufresne.

187
00:15:06,424 --> 00:15:08,023
Lights out!

188
00:15:27,702 --> 00:15:29,942
I remember my first night.

189
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:33,582
Seems like a long time ago.

190
00:15:36,661 --> 00:15:38,181
Hey, fish.

191
00:15:39,181 --> 00:15:40,901
Fish, fish.

192
00:15:42,421 --> 00:15:44,101
What are you, scared of the dark?

193
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,941
Bet you wish your daddy
never dicked your mama!

194
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:52,460
Piggy! Pork!
I want me a pork chop.

195
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,539
The boys always go fishing
with first-timers.

196
00:16:03,859 --> 00:16:06,699
And they don't quit
till they reel someone in.

197
00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:09,538
Hey, Fat Ass.

198
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:12,259
Fat Ass!

199
00:16:13,418 --> 00:16:15,058
Talk to me, boy.

200
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:18,338
I know you're there.
I can hear you breathing.

201
00:16:18,538 --> 00:16:21,378
Don't you listen to these nitwits,
you hear me?

202
00:16:21,578 --> 00:16:23,378
This place ain't so bad.

203
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:24,978
Tell you what...

204
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:29,177
...I'll introduce you around,
make you feel right at home.

205
00:16:29,737 --> 00:16:32,578
I know a couple of
big old bull queers that'd just...

206
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:34,657
...love to make your acquaintance.

207
00:16:34,857 --> 00:16:38,216
Especially that big, white,
mushy butt of yours.

208
00:16:38,417 --> 00:16:39,456
God!

209
00:16:40,136 --> 00:16:41,457
I don't belong here!

210
00:16:41,656 --> 00:16:44,376
-We have a winner!
-I want to go home!

211
00:16:44,616 --> 00:16:47,176
And it's Fat Ass by a nose!

212
00:16:49,896 --> 00:16:51,535
Fresh fish!

213
00:16:57,415 --> 00:16:59,135
I want to go home!

214
00:17:00,095 --> 00:17:01,255
I want my mother!

215
00:17:01,535 --> 00:17:03,615
I had your mother!
She wasn't that great!

216
00:17:07,815 --> 00:17:09,694
What the Christ is this horseshit?

217
00:17:09,894 --> 00:17:11,935
He blasphemed. I'll tell the warden.

218
00:17:12,134 --> 00:17:14,413
You'll tell him
with my baton up your ass!

219
00:17:14,614 --> 00:17:15,414
Let me out!

220
00:17:15,614 --> 00:17:18,853
What is your malfunction,
you fat barrel of monkey spunk?

221
00:17:19,054 --> 00:17:21,934
Please! I ain't supposed to be here.

222
00:17:22,413 --> 00:17:23,454
Not me!

223
00:17:23,653 --> 00:17:25,853
I won't count to three.
Not even to one.

224
00:17:26,053 --> 00:17:28,053
You shut up,
or I'll sing you a lullaby!

225
00:17:28,493 --> 00:17:31,133
Shut up, man. Shut up!

226
00:17:31,813 --> 00:17:34,372
You don't understand.
I'm not supposed to be here.

227
00:17:34,572 --> 00:17:35,812
Open that cell.

228
00:17:36,012 --> 00:17:39,132
Me neither! They run this place
like a fucking prison!

229
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,252
Son of a bitch!

230
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:55,211
Captain, take it easy!

231
00:18:16,689 --> 00:18:19,809
If I hear so much as a mouse fart
in here tonight...

232
00:18:20,009 --> 00:18:23,329
...I swear by God and Jesus,
you will all visit the infirmary.

233
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:26,008
Every last motherfucker in here.

234
00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:32,808
Call the trustees. Take that
tub of shit down to the infirmary.

235
00:18:46,567 --> 00:18:51,007
His first night in the joint, Dufresne
cost me two packs of cigarettes.

236
00:18:51,207 --> 00:18:54,087
He never made a sound.

237
00:19:08,805 --> 00:19:11,045
Tier 3 north, clear count!

238
00:19:11,925 --> 00:19:13,685
Tier 2 north, clear count.

239
00:19:14,165 --> 00:19:16,405
Tier 3 south, clear.

240
00:19:21,085 --> 00:19:22,564
Prepare to roll out.

241
00:19:26,044 --> 00:19:27,444
Roll out!

242
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,240
Are you going to eat that?

243
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,080
I hadn't planned on it.

244
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:26,280
Do you mind?

245
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:35,839
That's nice and ripe.

246
00:20:47,118 --> 00:20:49,078
Jake says thank you.

247
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:52,598
Fell out of his nest
over by the plate shop.

248
00:20:53,997 --> 00:20:57,197
I'm going to look after him
until he's big enough to fly.

249
00:20:58,638 --> 00:21:00,037
Oh, no! Here he comes.

250
00:21:03,237 --> 00:21:04,597
Morning, fellas.

251
00:21:04,836 --> 00:21:06,677
Fine morning, isn't it?

252
00:21:06,997 --> 00:21:09,156
You know why it's a fine morning,
don't you?

253
00:21:09,396 --> 00:21:11,556
Send them down.
I want them lined up...

254
00:21:11,796 --> 00:21:14,276
...just like a pretty little
chorus line.

255
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:16,476
Look at that.

256
00:21:16,996 --> 00:21:20,036
-I can't stand this guy.
-Oh, Lord!

257
00:21:20,676 --> 00:21:23,036
Yes! Richmond, Virginia.

258
00:21:23,235 --> 00:21:24,556
Smell my ass!

259
00:21:24,755 --> 00:21:26,635
After he smells mine.

260
00:21:27,075 --> 00:21:30,634
That's a shame about your horse
coming in last and all.

261
00:21:30,835 --> 00:21:33,514
But I sure do love
that winning horse of mine, though.

262
00:21:33,715 --> 00:21:36,154
I owe that boy a big kiss
when I see him.

263
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:40,834
Why don't you give him some of your
cigarettes instead? Lucky fuck!

264
00:21:41,074 --> 00:21:42,594
Hey, Tyrell.

265
00:21:42,914 --> 00:21:44,834
You pull infirmary duty this week?

266
00:21:45,713 --> 00:21:47,233
How's my horse doing anyway?

267
00:21:47,633 --> 00:21:48,714
Dead.

268
00:21:49,553 --> 00:21:51,633
Hadley busted his head up pretty good.

269
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:53,953
Doc had gone home for the night.

270
00:21:54,433 --> 00:21:56,593
Poor bastard lay there
till this morning.

271
00:21:56,793 --> 00:21:59,152
By then, there wasn't nothing
we could do.

272
00:22:05,232 --> 00:22:06,472
What was his name?

273
00:22:09,711 --> 00:22:10,912
What'd you say?

274
00:22:12,751 --> 00:22:15,032
I was just wondering
if anyone knew his name.

275
00:22:15,671 --> 00:22:18,312
What the fuck do you care, new fish?

276
00:22:19,311 --> 00:22:22,311
Doesn't fucking matter
what his name was. He's dead.

277
00:22:43,469 --> 00:22:45,350
Anybody come at you yet?

278
00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:49,189
Anybody get to you yet?

279
00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:53,188
Hey, we all need friends in here.

280
00:22:53,509 --> 00:22:55,108
I could be a friend to you.

281
00:23:03,948 --> 00:23:05,267
Hard to get.

282
00:23:07,307 --> 00:23:08,707
I like that.

283
00:23:15,387 --> 00:23:18,467
Andy kept pretty much
to himself at first.

284
00:23:18,826 --> 00:23:20,707
I guess he had a lot on his mind...

285
00:23:21,107 --> 00:23:23,826
...trying to adapt
to life on the inside.

286
00:23:24,546 --> 00:23:27,586
Wasn't until a month went by
before he opened his mouth...

287
00:23:27,786 --> 00:23:30,066
...to say more than two words
to somebody.

288
00:23:31,226 --> 00:23:32,705
As it turned out...

289
00:23:33,186 --> 00:23:34,946
...that somebody was me.

290
00:23:43,384 --> 00:23:45,065
I'm Andy Dufresne.

291
00:23:46,264 --> 00:23:47,904
Wife-killing banker.

292
00:23:50,065 --> 00:23:51,344
Why'd you do it?

293
00:23:51,784 --> 00:23:53,744
I didn't, since you ask.

294
00:23:54,345 --> 00:23:56,064
You're going to fit right in.

295
00:23:56,304 --> 00:23:58,864
Everybody in here's innocent.
Didn't you know that?

296
00:23:59,463 --> 00:24:02,544
-What you in here for?
-Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.

297
00:24:05,463 --> 00:24:07,903
Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.

298
00:24:08,103 --> 00:24:11,583
You think your shit smells
sweeter than most. Is that right?

299
00:24:11,782 --> 00:24:13,182
What do you think?

300
00:24:13,543 --> 00:24:16,462
To tell you the truth,
I haven't made up my mind.

301
00:24:17,542 --> 00:24:20,222
I understand you're a man
that knows how to get things.

302
00:24:21,182 --> 00:24:24,342
I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time.

303
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:26,982
I wonder if you might get me
a rock hammer.

304
00:24:27,662 --> 00:24:28,902
A rock hammer.

305
00:24:29,262 --> 00:24:31,821
-What is it and why?
-What do you care?

306
00:24:33,141 --> 00:24:35,741
For a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask.
I'd quote a price.

307
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:38,260
But a toothbrush
is a non-lethal object, isn't it?

308
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,101
Fair enough.

309
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,060
A rock hammer is about
six or seven inches long.

310
00:24:44,261 --> 00:24:46,461
-Looks like a miniature pickax.
-Pickax?

311
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,820
For rocks.

312
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,500
Quartz?

313
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:58,579
And some mica, shale...

314
00:24:59,779 --> 00:25:01,019
...limestone.

315
00:25:01,219 --> 00:25:02,299
So?

316
00:25:03,219 --> 00:25:04,979
So I'm a rock hound.

317
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:08,379
At least I was in my old life.
I'd like to be again.

318
00:25:08,619 --> 00:25:11,618
Or maybe you'd like to sink your toy
into somebody's skull.

319
00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:14,538
No, I have no enemies here.

320
00:25:14,738 --> 00:25:16,938
No? Wait a while.

321
00:25:18,498 --> 00:25:20,018
Word gets around.

322
00:25:20,698 --> 00:25:23,058
The Sisters have taken
quite a liking to you.

323
00:25:24,418 --> 00:25:26,137
Especially Bogs.

324
00:25:27,097 --> 00:25:30,377
Don't suppose it would help if l
told them I'm not homosexual.

325
00:25:30,577 --> 00:25:31,937
Neither are they.

326
00:25:32,136 --> 00:25:35,456
You have to be human first.
They don't qualify.

327
00:25:39,776 --> 00:25:44,016
Bull queers take by force.
That's all they want or understand.

328
00:25:44,215 --> 00:25:47,576
If I were you, I'd grow eyes
in the back of my head.

329
00:25:47,775 --> 00:25:50,455
-Thanks for the advice.
-Well, that's free.

330
00:25:50,776 --> 00:25:52,655
You understand my concern.

331
00:25:52,855 --> 00:25:55,335
If there's trouble,
I won't use the rock hammer.

332
00:25:56,215 --> 00:26:00,095
Then I'd guess you want to escape.
Tunnel under the wall, maybe.

333
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:02,575
What did I miss?
What's so funny?

334
00:26:02,975 --> 00:26:05,534
You'll understand
when you see the rock hammer.

335
00:26:07,294 --> 00:26:09,454
What's an item like this usually go for?

336
00:26:09,654 --> 00:26:12,014
Seven dollars in any rock-and-gem shop.

337
00:26:12,534 --> 00:26:14,894
My normal markup's 20 percent.

338
00:26:15,093 --> 00:26:17,333
But this is a specialty item.

339
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:21,813
Risk goes up, price goes up.
Let's make it an even 1 0 bucks.

340
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:23,293
Ten it is.

341
00:26:24,973 --> 00:26:26,892
Waste of money, if you ask me.

342
00:26:27,172 --> 00:26:28,412
Why's that?

343
00:26:29,772 --> 00:26:32,652
Folks around this joint
love surprise inspections.

344
00:26:34,212 --> 00:26:36,092
They find it, you're going to lose it.

345
00:26:36,292 --> 00:26:38,292
If they catch you, you don't know me.

346
00:26:38,492 --> 00:26:40,652
Mention my name, we never
do business again.

347
00:26:41,131 --> 00:26:44,092
Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum.
Now you got that?

348
00:26:44,891 --> 00:26:46,411
I understand.

349
00:26:47,571 --> 00:26:49,571
Thank you, Mr....

350
00:26:49,771 --> 00:26:50,730
Red.

351
00:26:51,451 --> 00:26:52,691
Name's Red.

352
00:26:54,091 --> 00:26:55,651
Why do they call you that?

353
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:01,170
Maybe it's because I'm Irish.

354
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:11,769
I could see why some of the boys
took him for snobby.

355
00:27:12,609 --> 00:27:14,929
He had a quiet way about him...

356
00:27:15,289 --> 00:27:19,249
...a walk and a talk that just
wasn't normal around here.

357
00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:21,009
He strolled...

358
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:25,208
...like a man in the park without a care
or a worry in the world.

359
00:27:25,409 --> 00:27:29,888
Like he had on an invisible coat
that would shield him from this place.

360
00:27:31,768 --> 00:27:33,888
I think it'd be fair to say...

361
00:27:34,168 --> 00:27:36,287
...I liked Andy from the start.

362
00:27:37,768 --> 00:27:41,407
Let's go! Some of us
got a schedule to keep.

363
00:27:44,607 --> 00:27:47,007
Move it! Come on, move it!

364
00:27:49,527 --> 00:27:52,326
How you doing?
How's the wife treating you?

365
00:28:28,884 --> 00:28:30,284
Andy was right.

366
00:28:30,524 --> 00:28:32,683
I finally got the joke.

367
00:28:32,963 --> 00:28:35,243
It would take a man about 600 years...

368
00:28:35,443 --> 00:28:37,803
...to tunnel under the wall
with one of these.

369
00:28:41,442 --> 00:28:43,762
-Book?
-Not today.

370
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:50,522
Book?

371
00:28:57,562 --> 00:28:59,642
Delivery for Dufresne.

372
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,120
Here's your book.

373
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,119
Thanks.

374
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,678
We're running low on hexite.
Get on back and fetch us up some.

375
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:10,956
This will blind you.

376
00:30:11,316 --> 00:30:13,636
Honey, hush.

377
00:30:25,675 --> 00:30:27,555
That's it. You fight!

378
00:30:27,755 --> 00:30:29,155
Better that way.

379
00:30:37,034 --> 00:30:40,034
I wish I could tell you
Andy fought the good fight...

380
00:30:40,234 --> 00:30:42,113
...and the Sisters let him be.

381
00:30:42,673 --> 00:30:44,433
I wish I could tell you that...

382
00:30:44,633 --> 00:30:47,473
...but prison is no fairy-tale world.

383
00:30:48,553 --> 00:30:50,473
He never said who did it.

384
00:30:50,673 --> 00:30:52,193
But we all knew.

385
00:30:56,873 --> 00:30:59,233
Things went on like that for a while.

386
00:30:59,633 --> 00:31:02,032
Prison life consists of routine...

387
00:31:02,312 --> 00:31:04,192
...and then more routine.

388
00:31:06,592 --> 00:31:09,951
Every so often, Andy would show up
with fresh bruises.

389
00:31:11,391 --> 00:31:13,151
The Sisters kept at him.

390
00:31:13,352 --> 00:31:15,351
Sometimes he was able
to fight them off.

391
00:31:15,551 --> 00:31:16,951
Sometimes not.

392
00:31:18,111 --> 00:31:20,191
And that's how it went for Andy.

393
00:31:20,711 --> 00:31:22,430
That was his routine.

394
00:31:23,231 --> 00:31:26,511
I do believe those first two years
were the worst for him.

395
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:30,230
And I also believe that
if things had gone on that way...

396
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,869
...this place would have
got the best of him.

397
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:36,309
But then, in the spring of 1949...

398
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:38,310
...the powers that be decided:

399
00:31:38,509 --> 00:31:41,709
The roof of the license-plate factory
needs resurfacing.

400
00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:44,989
I need a dozen volunteers
for a week's work.

401
00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:47,069
As you know...

402
00:31:47,749 --> 00:31:51,189
...special detail carries with it
special privileges.

403
00:31:51,388 --> 00:31:53,669
It was outdoor detail...

404
00:31:54,068 --> 00:31:58,148
...and May is one damned fine month
to be working outdoors.

405
00:31:58,388 --> 00:31:59,668
Stay in line there.

406
00:31:59,867 --> 00:32:02,907
More than a hundred men
volunteered for the job.

407
00:32:06,988 --> 00:32:09,867
Wallace E. Unger.

408
00:32:10,347 --> 00:32:12,626
Ellis Redding.

409
00:32:12,827 --> 00:32:14,307
Wouldn't you know it?

410
00:32:14,747 --> 00:32:17,906
Me and some fellows I know
were among the names called.

411
00:32:18,107 --> 00:32:19,986
Andrew Dufresne.

412
00:32:20,386 --> 00:32:23,226
It only cost us
a pack of smokes per man.

413
00:32:23,706 --> 00:32:26,065
I made my usual 20 percent, of course.

414
00:32:26,266 --> 00:32:29,586
So this big-shot lawyer
calls me long-distance from Texas.

415
00:32:29,785 --> 00:32:31,266
I say, "Yeah?"

416
00:32:31,546 --> 00:32:35,025
He says, "Sorry to inform you,
but your brother just died."

417
00:32:35,225 --> 00:32:38,945
-I'm sorry to hear that.
-I'm not. He was an asshole.

418
00:32:39,145 --> 00:32:41,265
Ran off years ago.
Figured him for dead.

419
00:32:41,464 --> 00:32:43,664
So this lawyer fellow says to me:

420
00:32:43,865 --> 00:32:47,824
"He died a rich man." Oil wells
and shit. Close to a million bucks.

421
00:32:48,464 --> 00:32:50,264
A million bucks?

422
00:32:50,544 --> 00:32:54,864
-Incredible how lucky some assholes get.
-You going to see any of that?

423
00:32:55,423 --> 00:32:58,104
Thirty-five thousand.
That's what he left me.

424
00:32:58,303 --> 00:32:59,423
Dollars?

425
00:33:00,143 --> 00:33:03,023
That's great! That's like
winning the sweepstakes.

426
00:33:03,343 --> 00:33:04,383
Isn't it?

427
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:07,423
Dumb shit, what do you think
the government will do to me?

428
00:33:07,622 --> 00:33:09,903
Take a big wet bite
out of my ass is what.

429
00:33:10,623 --> 00:33:11,902
Poor Byron.

430
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:15,822
Terrible fucking luck, huh?
Crying shame.

431
00:33:16,022 --> 00:33:18,181
Some people really got it awful.

432
00:33:18,461 --> 00:33:19,742
Andy, are you nuts?

433
00:33:19,942 --> 00:33:21,781
Keep your eyes on your mop, man!

434
00:33:21,982 --> 00:33:24,821
You'll pay some tax,
but you'll still end up--

435
00:33:25,022 --> 00:33:27,701
Yeah, maybe enough to buy
a new car, and then what?

436
00:33:27,902 --> 00:33:29,941
I got to pay tax on the car. Repair...

437
00:33:30,181 --> 00:33:33,781
...maintenance, kids pestering you
to take them for a ride all the time.

438
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:37,501
Then if you figure your tax wrong,
you pay out of your own pocket.

439
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,740
I tell you! Uncle Sam!

440
00:33:39,981 --> 00:33:43,820
He puts his hand in your shirt
and squeezes your tit till it's purple.

441
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,420
-Getting himself killed.
-Keep tarring.

442
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:51,060
Some brother.
Shit!

443
00:33:55,819 --> 00:33:57,139
Mr. Hadley...

444
00:33:57,979 --> 00:33:59,299
...do you trust your wife?

445
00:34:00,858 --> 00:34:02,259
Oh, that's funny.

446
00:34:02,778 --> 00:34:05,298
You'll look funnier
sucking my dick with no teeth.

447
00:34:05,498 --> 00:34:08,698
What I mean is, do you think
she'd go behind your back?

448
00:34:09,818 --> 00:34:13,018
Step aside, Mert. This fucker's
having himself an accident.

449
00:34:13,258 --> 00:34:14,218
He'll push him off!

450
00:34:14,458 --> 00:34:16,217
If you trust her, you can keep...

451
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:17,778
...that 35,000.

452
00:34:18,498 --> 00:34:20,897
-What did you say?
-Thirty-five thousand.

453
00:34:21,697 --> 00:34:22,697
All of it.

454
00:34:22,897 --> 00:34:25,817
-Every penny.
-You better start making sense.

455
00:34:26,017 --> 00:34:28,257
If you want to keep it,
give it to your wife.

456
00:34:28,457 --> 00:34:32,176
The IRS allows a one-time-only gift
to your spouse for up to $60,000.

457
00:34:32,377 --> 00:34:34,656
-Bullshit. Tax-free?
-Tax-free.

458
00:34:34,856 --> 00:34:36,736
IRS can't touch one cent.

459
00:34:37,136 --> 00:34:39,496
You're that smart banker
that killed his wife.

460
00:34:39,736 --> 00:34:42,936
Why should I believe you?
So I can end up in here with you?

461
00:34:43,136 --> 00:34:45,855
It's legal. Ask the IRS.
They'll say the same thing.

462
00:34:46,056 --> 00:34:49,936
I feel stupid telling you this.
I'm sure you would have investigated.

463
00:34:50,135 --> 00:34:53,654
I don't need you to tell me
where the bear shit in the buckwheat.

464
00:34:53,855 --> 00:34:57,135
Of course not. But you do need
someone to set it up for you.

465
00:34:57,335 --> 00:34:58,815
That'll cost you. A lawyer.

466
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:01,175
A bunch of ball-washing bastards!

467
00:35:01,614 --> 00:35:04,934
I suppose I could set it up for you.
That would save you some money.

468
00:35:05,174 --> 00:35:07,134
You get the forms, I'll prepare them...

469
00:35:07,373 --> 00:35:09,013
...nearly free of charge.

470
00:35:10,214 --> 00:35:13,374
I'd only ask three beers apiece
for each of my coworkers.

471
00:35:14,293 --> 00:35:15,773
"Coworkers." That's rich!

472
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:19,012
A man working outdoors
feels more like a man...

473
00:35:19,213 --> 00:35:22,533
...if he can have a bottle of suds.
That's only my opinion...

474
00:35:22,933 --> 00:35:23,893
...sir.

475
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:29,532
What are you jimmies staring at?

476
00:35:29,732 --> 00:35:31,252
Let's go! Work!

477
00:35:40,372 --> 00:35:42,251
And that's how it came to pass...

478
00:35:42,452 --> 00:35:44,971
...that on the second-to-last
day of the job...

479
00:35:45,171 --> 00:35:49,571
...the convict crew that tarred
the factory roof in the spring of '49...

480
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:52,770
...wound up sitting in a row
at 10:00 in the morning...

481
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:58,210
...drinking icy-cold beer,
courtesy of the hardest screw...

482
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:01,529
...that ever walked a turn
at Shawshank State Prison.

483
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:04,049
Drink up while it's cold, ladies.

484
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:09,489
The colossal prick even managed
to sound magnanimous.

485
00:36:10,609 --> 00:36:14,848
We sat and drank with the sun
on our shoulders and felt like free men.

486
00:36:15,248 --> 00:36:18,529
We could have been tarring
the roof of one of our own houses.

487
00:36:18,728 --> 00:36:21,448
We were the lords of all creation.

488
00:36:21,968 --> 00:36:23,488
As for Andy...

489
00:36:23,728 --> 00:36:26,248
...he spent that break
hunkered in the shade...

490
00:36:26,448 --> 00:36:28,847
...a strange little smile on his face...

491
00:36:29,088 --> 00:36:31,207
...watching us drink his beer.

492
00:36:38,967 --> 00:36:40,287
Want a cold one?

493
00:36:40,927 --> 00:36:43,727
No, thanks. I gave up drinking.

494
00:36:47,566 --> 00:36:50,487
You could argue he done it
to curry favor with the guards.

495
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:54,806
Or maybe make a few friends
among us cons.

496
00:36:55,526 --> 00:36:56,526
Me?

497
00:36:56,726 --> 00:36:59,406
I think he did it
just to feel normal again...

498
00:36:59,845 --> 00:37:01,965
...if only for a short while.

499
00:37:04,485 --> 00:37:05,565
King me.

500
00:37:07,364 --> 00:37:09,885
-Chess. Now there's a game of kings.
-What?

501
00:37:10,085 --> 00:37:11,725
Civilized. Strategic.

502
00:37:12,364 --> 00:37:15,244
And a total fucking mystery.
I hate it.

503
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:17,204
Let me teach you someday.

504
00:37:18,724 --> 00:37:19,644
Sure.

505
00:37:20,084 --> 00:37:21,763
We could get a board together.

506
00:37:21,964 --> 00:37:24,923
You're talking to the right man.
I can get things, right?

507
00:37:25,123 --> 00:37:28,923
We might do business on a board,
and I'll carve the pieces myself.

508
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:32,323
One side in alabaster, one in soapstone.
What do you think?

509
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:34,243
I think it'll take years.

510
00:37:34,402 --> 00:37:36,843
Years I got.
What I don't have are the rocks.

511
00:37:37,043 --> 00:37:38,922
Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.

512
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:40,882
Pebbles, mostly.

513
00:37:45,042 --> 00:37:47,722
We're getting to be
kind of friends, aren't we?

514
00:37:48,562 --> 00:37:50,041
Yeah, I guess.

515
00:37:50,682 --> 00:37:52,121
Can I ask you something?

516
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:54,922
Why'd you do it?

517
00:37:56,121 --> 00:37:57,601
I'm innocent, Red.

518
00:37:57,801 --> 00:37:59,760
Just like everybody else here.

519
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,400
What are you in for?

520
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,080
Murder. Same as you.

521
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,400
Innocent?

522
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,320
Only guilty man in Shawshank.

523
00:39:13,195 --> 00:39:14,636
Where's the canary?

524
00:39:14,835 --> 00:39:16,075
How did you know?

525
00:39:16,276 --> 00:39:18,475
-How did I know what?
-So you don't know.

526
00:39:18,675 --> 00:39:19,795
Come.

527
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:24,195
This is where the canary is.

528
00:39:26,754 --> 00:39:29,954
Quite a surprise to hear
a woman singing in my house, eh?

529
00:39:33,314 --> 00:39:34,673
That's quite a...

530
00:39:35,554 --> 00:39:37,153
...surprise.

531
00:39:41,273 --> 00:39:42,633
Wait, wait.

532
00:39:43,154 --> 00:39:44,593
Here she comes.

533
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:47,593
I like this part when she
does that shit with her hair.

534
00:39:47,793 --> 00:39:50,393
I know. I've seen it
three times this month.

535
00:39:50,592 --> 00:39:52,433
Gilda, are you decent?

536
00:39:53,392 --> 00:39:54,472
Me?

537
00:39:57,072 --> 00:39:58,752
God, I love it.

538
00:40:03,712 --> 00:40:06,592
I understand you're a man
that knows how to get things.

539
00:40:07,552 --> 00:40:11,151
I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time. What do you want?

540
00:40:11,351 --> 00:40:13,391
-Rita Hayworth.
-What?

541
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,231
Can you get her?

542
00:40:16,591 --> 00:40:19,830
So this is Johnny Farrel.
I've heard a lot about you.

543
00:40:20,991 --> 00:40:23,191
-Take a few weeks.
-Weeks?

544
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:27,630
I don't have her stuffed down the front
of my pants right now, sorry to say.

545
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,430
But I'll get her.

546
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,909
Relax.

547
00:40:32,709 --> 00:40:33,949
Thanks.

548
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:55,388
-Get out!
-I got to change reels!

549
00:40:55,628 --> 00:40:57,547
I said fuck off!

550
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:04,747
Ain't you going to scream?

551
00:41:06,027 --> 00:41:07,827
Let's get this over with.

552
00:41:12,707 --> 00:41:14,627
He broke my fucking nose!

553
00:41:23,546 --> 00:41:24,746
Now...

554
00:41:25,186 --> 00:41:27,266
...I'm going to open my fly...

555
00:41:27,506 --> 00:41:30,185
...and you'll swallow
what I give you to swallow.

556
00:41:31,265 --> 00:41:33,745
Then you'll swallow Rooster's.
You broke his nose.

557
00:41:33,945 --> 00:41:35,985
He ought to have
something to show for it.

558
00:41:36,184 --> 00:41:37,984
You put it in my mouth,
you lose it.

559
00:41:38,185 --> 00:41:40,665
No, you don't understand.

560
00:41:40,984 --> 00:41:43,904
Do that and I'll put all eight inches
of this in your ear.

561
00:41:44,104 --> 00:41:47,424
All right, but you should know
that sudden, serious brain injury...

562
00:41:47,624 --> 00:41:49,464
...causes the victim to bite down hard.

563
00:41:49,664 --> 00:41:53,024
In fact, I hear the bite reflex
is so strong...

564
00:41:53,783 --> 00:41:56,143
...they have to pry
the victim's jaws open...

565
00:41:56,343 --> 00:41:57,663
...with a crowbar.

566
00:42:00,503 --> 00:42:01,982
Where do you get this shit?

567
00:42:02,183 --> 00:42:03,502
I read it.

568
00:42:04,862 --> 00:42:07,423
You know how to read,
you ignorant fuck?

569
00:42:09,022 --> 00:42:10,062
Honey!

570
00:42:11,942 --> 00:42:13,582
You shouldn't!

571
00:42:16,182 --> 00:42:18,942
Bogs didn't put anything
in Andy's mouth.

572
00:42:19,222 --> 00:42:21,181
And neither did his friends.

573
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:25,261
What they did do is beat him
within an inch of his life.

574
00:42:25,941 --> 00:42:28,300
Andy spent a month in the infirmary.

575
00:42:29,101 --> 00:42:31,500
Bogs spent a week in the hole.

576
00:42:35,421 --> 00:42:36,900
Time's up, Bogs.

577
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,140
It's your world, boss.

578
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,979
Return to your cellblocks
for evening count.

579
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:50,699
All prisoners report for lock down.

580
00:43:05,018 --> 00:43:06,018
What?

581
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:20,577
-Where's he going?
-Grab his ankles.

582
00:43:26,137 --> 00:43:27,336
Help!

583
00:43:30,856 --> 00:43:33,376
Two things never happened again
after that.

584
00:43:33,616 --> 00:43:36,615
The Sisters never
laid a finger on Andy again.

585
00:43:37,416 --> 00:43:39,815
And Bogs would never walk again.

586
00:43:40,936 --> 00:43:44,295
They transferred him
to a minimum-security hospital upstate.

587
00:43:44,495 --> 00:43:47,175
To my knowledge, he lived out
the rest of his days...

588
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,094
...drinking his food through a straw.

589
00:43:50,054 --> 00:43:54,015
Andy could use a nice welcome back
when he gets out of the infirmary.

590
00:43:55,655 --> 00:43:57,174
Sounds good to us.

591
00:43:57,414 --> 00:43:59,814
I figure we owe him that much
for the beer.

592
00:44:00,534 --> 00:44:02,694
The man likes to play chess.

593
00:44:03,174 --> 00:44:05,013
Let's get him some rocks.

594
00:44:36,331 --> 00:44:37,492
Guys!

595
00:44:38,251 --> 00:44:39,251
I got one.

596
00:44:39,451 --> 00:44:40,891
I got one. Look!

597
00:44:42,691 --> 00:44:46,610
Heywood, that isn't soapstone!
And it ain't alabaster either.

598
00:44:46,811 --> 00:44:48,610
What are you, a fucking geologist?

599
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:50,490
He's right. It ain't.

600
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:53,450
-What the hell is it then?
-It's a horse apple.

601
00:44:54,369 --> 00:44:56,690
-Bullshit!
-No, horseshit.

602
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:58,290
Petrified.

603
00:45:06,929 --> 00:45:08,088
Damn!

604
00:45:08,369 --> 00:45:12,449
Despite a few hitches,
the boys came through in fine style.

605
00:45:12,608 --> 00:45:14,528
And by the weekend
he was due back...

606
00:45:14,728 --> 00:45:18,288
...we had enough rocks saved up
to keep him busy till rapture.

607
00:45:19,088 --> 00:45:21,488
Also got a big shipment in that week.

608
00:45:21,728 --> 00:45:22,808
Cigarettes...

609
00:45:23,008 --> 00:45:24,007
...chewing gum...

610
00:45:24,208 --> 00:45:25,608
...sipping whisky...

611
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:29,087
...playing cards with naked ladies
on them. You name it.

612
00:45:29,287 --> 00:45:31,887
And of course, the most important item:

613
00:45:33,687 --> 00:45:35,647
Rita Hayworth herself.

614
00:46:11,244 --> 00:46:13,404
Heads up.
They're tossing cells.

615
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:16,204
Heads up.
They're tossing cells!

616
00:46:17,724 --> 00:46:19,163
119.

617
00:46:20,923 --> 00:46:22,524
123.

618
00:46:32,563 --> 00:46:33,363
On your feet.

619
00:46:35,882 --> 00:46:37,322
Face the wall.

620
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,880
Turn around and face the warden.

621
00:47:18,199 --> 00:47:20,199
Pleased to see you reading this.

622
00:47:21,479 --> 00:47:23,318
Any favorite passages?

623
00:47:24,158 --> 00:47:26,439
"Watch ye, therefore,
for ye know not...

624
00:47:26,638 --> 00:47:28,759
...when the master
of the house cometh."

625
00:47:29,879 --> 00:47:31,958
Mark 1 3:35.

626
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:34,438
I've always liked that one.

627
00:47:35,318 --> 00:47:36,918
But I prefer...

628
00:47:37,398 --> 00:47:39,158
..."l am the light of the world.

629
00:47:39,637 --> 00:47:42,797
Ye that followeth me
shall have the light of life."

630
00:47:42,997 --> 00:47:45,518
John, chapter 8, verse 1 2.

631
00:47:45,757 --> 00:47:47,717
I hear you're good with numbers.

632
00:47:47,917 --> 00:47:48,877
How nice.

633
00:47:50,037 --> 00:47:51,917
Man should have a skill.

634
00:47:54,356 --> 00:47:55,316
Explain this.

635
00:47:56,436 --> 00:48:00,356
It's called a rock blanket.
It's for shaping and polishing rocks.

636
00:48:00,756 --> 00:48:02,596
A little hobby of mine.

637
00:48:13,035 --> 00:48:14,395
It's pretty clean.

638
00:48:14,675 --> 00:48:17,634
Some contraband here,
but nothing to get in a twist over.

639
00:48:21,794 --> 00:48:23,714
I can't say I approve of this.

640
00:48:25,274 --> 00:48:26,675
But I suppose...

641
00:48:28,674 --> 00:48:30,594
...exceptions can be made.

642
00:48:40,553 --> 00:48:41,833
Lock them up!

643
00:48:44,593 --> 00:48:46,113
I almost forgot.

644
00:48:46,513 --> 00:48:48,593
I'd hate to deprive you of this.

645
00:48:49,312 --> 00:48:51,152
Salvation lies within.

646
00:48:51,353 --> 00:48:52,392
Yes, sir.

647
00:49:00,591 --> 00:49:03,031
Tossing cells was just an excuse.

648
00:49:03,471 --> 00:49:04,671
Truth is...

649
00:49:04,871 --> 00:49:07,231
...Norton wanted to size Andy up.

650
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:22,590
My wife made that in church group.

651
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:26,390
Very nice, sir.

652
00:49:27,909 --> 00:49:29,310
You enjoy working the laundry?

653
00:49:30,909 --> 00:49:32,549
No, sir. Not especially.

654
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:35,189
Perhaps we can find something more...

655
00:49:35,469 --> 00:49:37,789
...befitting a man of your education.

656
00:49:45,548 --> 00:49:46,948
Hey, Jake.
Where's Brooks?

657
00:49:48,748 --> 00:49:51,388
I thought I heard you out here.

658
00:49:52,028 --> 00:49:53,507
I've been reassigned to you.

659
00:49:53,787 --> 00:49:56,027
I know, they told me.

660
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,787
Ain't that a kick in the head?

661
00:49:58,987 --> 00:50:01,227
Well, I'll give you the dime tour.

662
00:50:01,387 --> 00:50:02,507
Come on.

663
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:05,547
Well, here she is.

664
00:50:05,706 --> 00:50:07,626
The Shawshank Prison Library.

665
00:50:08,267 --> 00:50:10,187
National Geographics...

666
00:50:11,066 --> 00:50:13,746
... Reader's Digest condensed books...

667
00:50:13,946 --> 00:50:15,466
...and Louis L'Amour.

668
00:50:16,026 --> 00:50:17,785
Look magazine.

669
00:50:18,106 --> 00:50:20,346
Erle Stanley Gardners.

670
00:50:20,586 --> 00:50:23,906
Every evening I load up the cart
and make my rounds.

671
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:26,665
I enter the names
on this clipboard here.

672
00:50:27,145 --> 00:50:29,785
Easy, peasy, Japanese-y.

673
00:50:30,505 --> 00:50:33,265
-Any questions?
-How long have you been librarian?

674
00:50:34,424 --> 00:50:38,304
I come here in '05,
and they made me librarian in 1 9 1 2.

675
00:50:39,544 --> 00:50:41,624
And have you ever had an assistant?

676
00:50:41,864 --> 00:50:44,184
No. Not much to it, really.

677
00:50:44,904 --> 00:50:46,104
Why me? Why now?

678
00:50:46,504 --> 00:50:47,784
I don't know.

679
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:50,863
But it'd be nice to have
some company down here.

680
00:51:01,662 --> 00:51:03,862
That's him.
That's the one.

681
00:51:11,182 --> 00:51:12,302
I'm Dekins.

682
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:14,262
I was thinking...

683
00:51:14,902 --> 00:51:18,621
...about setting up some kind of
trust fund for my kids' educations.

684
00:51:22,341 --> 00:51:23,781
I see.

685
00:51:28,661 --> 00:51:31,500
Why don't we have a seat
and talk it over.

686
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:37,420
Do you have a piece of paper
and a pencil?

687
00:51:48,299 --> 00:51:49,539
Thanks.

688
00:51:50,179 --> 00:51:51,219
So....

689
00:51:52,899 --> 00:51:54,579
Mister Dekins....

690
00:51:55,379 --> 00:51:57,378
And then Andy says, "Mr. Dekins...

691
00:51:57,579 --> 00:52:00,458
...do you want your sons
to go to Harvard or Yale?"

692
00:52:00,658 --> 00:52:01,658
He didn't say that!

693
00:52:02,018 --> 00:52:04,378
As God as my witness!

694
00:52:04,658 --> 00:52:06,338
Dekins blinked for a second...

695
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:09,498
...then he laughed
and actually shook Andy's hand.

696
00:52:09,938 --> 00:52:12,097
-My ass!
-Shook his hand.

697
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:15,137
I tell you, I near soiled myself!

698
00:52:15,297 --> 00:52:19,417
All he needed was a suit and tie
and a jiggly hula gal on his desk...

699
00:52:19,617 --> 00:52:22,096
...he'd have been
"Mr. Dufresne," if you please.

700
00:52:22,297 --> 00:52:23,856
Making a few friends?

701
00:52:25,096 --> 00:52:26,696
I wouldn't say "friends."

702
00:52:26,896 --> 00:52:30,576
I'm a convicted murderer
who provides sound financial planning.

703
00:52:30,776 --> 00:52:33,015
It's a wonderful pet to have.

704
00:52:33,216 --> 00:52:34,935
Got you out of the laundry, though.

705
00:52:35,456 --> 00:52:37,255
It might do more than that.

706
00:52:37,496 --> 00:52:40,095
How about expanding the library.
Get some new books.

707
00:52:40,256 --> 00:52:42,775
If you ask for something,
ask for a pool table.

708
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:47,255
How do you expect to do that?
I mean...

709
00:52:47,454 --> 00:52:50,334
...get new books in here,
"Mr. Dufresne, if you please."

710
00:52:50,774 --> 00:52:52,735
I'll ask the warden for funds.

711
00:52:53,575 --> 00:52:57,693
Six wardens have been through here
in my tenure, and I've learned...

712
00:52:57,894 --> 00:53:00,094
...one immutable, universal truth:

713
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:01,693
Not one born whose asshole...

714
00:53:01,853 --> 00:53:06,613
...wouldn't pucker up tighter than
a snare drum when you ask for funds.

715
00:53:07,453 --> 00:53:10,213
-The budget's stretched thin as it is.
-I see.

716
00:53:10,413 --> 00:53:13,693
Maybe I could write the state senate
and request funds from them.

717
00:53:13,892 --> 00:53:17,813
They have only three ways to spend
the taxpayers' money for prisons:

718
00:53:18,012 --> 00:53:20,372
More walls, more bars, more guards.

719
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:23,092
I'd like to try, with permission.
A letter a week.

720
00:53:23,292 --> 00:53:25,932
-They can't ignore me forever.
-Sure can.

721
00:53:26,172 --> 00:53:28,731
But you write your letters
if it makes you happy.

722
00:53:29,052 --> 00:53:31,532
I'll even mail them for you.
How's that?

723
00:53:33,131 --> 00:53:35,811
So Andy started writing
a letter a week...

724
00:53:36,011 --> 00:53:37,531
...just like he said.

725
00:53:41,531 --> 00:53:44,050
And like Norton said...

726
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:45,691
...Andy got no answers.

727
00:53:53,529 --> 00:53:58,249
The following April, he did tax returns
for half the guards at Shawshank.

728
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:01,689
Year after that, he did them all...

729
00:54:01,929 --> 00:54:03,769
...including the warden's.

730
00:54:05,448 --> 00:54:08,768
Year after that, they
rescheduled the intramural season...

731
00:54:08,969 --> 00:54:11,288
...to coincide with tax season.

732
00:54:12,808 --> 00:54:17,088
The guards on the opposing teams
all remembered to bring their W-2s.

733
00:54:17,288 --> 00:54:18,568
So Moresby Prison...

734
00:54:18,767 --> 00:54:20,928
...issued you a gun,
but you paid for it.

735
00:54:21,168 --> 00:54:22,808
Right. The holster too.

736
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:25,367
That's tax-deductible.
You can write that off.

737
00:54:25,527 --> 00:54:28,447
Yes, sir!
Andy was a regular cottage industry.

738
00:54:29,127 --> 00:54:33,446
In fact, it got so busy at tax time,
he was allowed a staff.

739
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:36,086
Could you hand me
a stack of 1 040s?

740
00:54:36,247 --> 00:54:40,886
Got me out of the wood shop a month out
of the year, and that was fine by me.

741
00:54:42,086 --> 00:54:45,126
And still, he kept
sending those letters.

742
00:54:51,605 --> 00:54:52,606
It's Brooks.

743
00:54:53,685 --> 00:54:55,125
Watch the door.

744
00:54:55,366 --> 00:54:56,645
Please, Brooks.

745
00:54:56,885 --> 00:54:58,645
-Calm the fuck down.
-Stay back!

746
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:01,564
-Stay back, goddamn it!
-What's going on?

747
00:55:01,765 --> 00:55:04,204
One second he's fine,
then out come the knives.

748
00:55:04,405 --> 00:55:06,164
We can talk about this, right?

749
00:55:06,404 --> 00:55:10,004
There's nothing to talk about.
I'll cut his fucking throat.

750
00:55:10,244 --> 00:55:11,924
What's he done to you?

751
00:55:12,084 --> 00:55:13,684
It's what they done!

752
00:55:14,163 --> 00:55:15,403
I got no choice.

753
00:55:15,843 --> 00:55:18,043
You won't hurt Heywood.
We all know that.

754
00:55:18,244 --> 00:55:20,604
-Right, Heywood?
-Sure.

755
00:55:20,843 --> 00:55:24,043
He's a friend of yours,
and Brooks is a reasonable man.

756
00:55:24,283 --> 00:55:25,323
Right, guys?

757
00:55:26,242 --> 00:55:28,683
So put the knife down.
Look at me.

758
00:55:28,882 --> 00:55:31,042
Put the knife down.

759
00:55:32,882 --> 00:55:34,922
Look at his neck, for God's sake.

760
00:55:35,602 --> 00:55:37,842
Look at his neck. He's bleeding.

761
00:55:38,721 --> 00:55:40,122
It's the only way...

762
00:55:40,322 --> 00:55:42,281
...they'd let me stay.

763
00:55:42,561 --> 00:55:44,842
This is crazy.
You don't want to do this.

764
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:47,041
Put it, put it down.

765
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,880
Take it easy.

766
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,040
You'll be all right.

767
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,560
Him? What about me?

768
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,080
Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat!

769
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,080
You've had worse from shaving.

770
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:08,280
What did you do to set him off?

771
00:56:08,479 --> 00:56:10,640
Nothing.
I come in here to say farewell.

772
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,759
Ain't you heard?
His parole's come through.

773
00:56:15,999 --> 00:56:18,679
I just don't understand
what happened in there.

774
00:56:18,879 --> 00:56:21,559
Old man's crazy as a rat
in a tin shithouse.

775
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,598
That's enough out of you.

776
00:56:23,758 --> 00:56:26,398
-Heard he had you shitting your pants.
-Fuck you.

777
00:56:26,638 --> 00:56:27,799
Knock it off.

778
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,118
Brooks ain't no bug.

779
00:56:33,798 --> 00:56:35,478
He's just institutionalized.

780
00:56:36,798 --> 00:56:38,638
"Institutionalized," my ass.

781
00:56:38,837 --> 00:56:42,677
The man's been in here 50 years,
Heywood, 50 years!

782
00:56:42,877 --> 00:56:44,557
This is all he knows.

783
00:56:44,717 --> 00:56:46,957
In here, he's an important man...

784
00:56:47,117 --> 00:56:48,197
...an educated man.

785
00:56:48,956 --> 00:56:50,797
Outside, he's nothing.

786
00:56:51,637 --> 00:56:54,996
Just a used-up con
with arthritis in both hands.

787
00:56:55,196 --> 00:56:58,076
Probably couldn't get a library card
if he tried.

788
00:56:58,316 --> 00:56:59,996
You know what I'm trying to say?

789
00:57:00,236 --> 00:57:03,036
I do believe
you're talking out of your ass.

790
00:57:04,236 --> 00:57:06,395
You believe whatever you want.

791
00:57:06,955 --> 00:57:09,275
But I tell you these walls are funny.

792
00:57:10,795 --> 00:57:12,394
First you hate them.

793
00:57:14,155 --> 00:57:15,994
Then you get used to them.

794
00:57:17,835 --> 00:57:19,755
Enough time passes...

795
00:57:20,394 --> 00:57:22,314
...you get so you depend on them.

796
00:57:23,274 --> 00:57:25,394
That's "institutionalized."

797
00:57:25,594 --> 00:57:26,834
Shit.

798
00:57:27,034 --> 00:57:29,673
-I could never get like that.
-Oh, yeah?

799
00:57:30,513 --> 00:57:32,913
Wait till you've been here
as long as Brooks.

800
00:57:33,153 --> 00:57:34,633
Goddamn right.

801
00:57:37,113 --> 00:57:38,953
They send you here for life...

802
00:57:39,593 --> 00:57:41,833
...that's exactly what they take.

803
00:57:43,513 --> 00:57:45,433
Part that counts, anyway.

804
00:57:52,711 --> 00:57:55,552
I can't take care of you no more, Jake.

805
00:57:56,672 --> 00:57:58,271
You go on now.

806
00:57:59,431 --> 00:58:00,871
You're free.

807
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,591
You're free.

808
00:58:21,829 --> 00:58:23,429
Good luck, Brooksie.

809
00:58:59,867 --> 00:59:01,306
Dear fellas:

810
00:59:01,547 --> 00:59:05,586
I can't believe how fast things move
on the outside.

811
00:59:06,826 --> 00:59:09,386
Watch it, old-timer!
Want to get killed?

812
00:59:10,586 --> 00:59:13,946
I saw an automobile once
when I was a kid...

813
00:59:14,546 --> 00:59:16,866
...but now they're everywhere.

814
00:59:20,385 --> 00:59:24,545
The world went and got itself
in a big damn hurry.

815
00:59:39,703 --> 00:59:43,303
The parole board
got me into this halfway house...

816
00:59:43,583 --> 00:59:45,183
...called "The Brewer"...

817
00:59:45,383 --> 00:59:46,504
...and a job...

818
00:59:46,703 --> 00:59:49,543
...bagging groceries at the Food-Way.

819
00:59:51,023 --> 00:59:53,343
It's hard work and I try to keep up...

820
00:59:53,542 --> 00:59:55,823
...but my hands hurt most of the time.

821
00:59:56,103 --> 00:59:57,982
Make sure your man double-bags.

822
00:59:58,183 --> 01:00:00,142
Last time, the bottom near came out.

823
01:00:00,783 --> 01:00:03,582
Make sure you double-bag
like the lady says. Understand?

824
01:00:03,782 --> 01:00:05,102
Yes, sir. Surely will.

825
01:00:05,302 --> 01:00:08,661
I don't think the store manager
likes me very much.

826
01:00:11,582 --> 01:00:15,701
Sometimes after work,
I go to the park and feed the birds.

827
01:00:16,101 --> 01:00:17,541
I keep thinking...

828
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:20,980
...Jake might just show up
and say hello.

829
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:23,460
But he never does.

830
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:29,300
I hope, wherever he is, he's doing okay
and making new friends.

831
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:35,379
I have trouble sleeping at night.

832
01:00:35,659 --> 01:00:38,780
I have bad dreams like I'm falling.

833
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:41,179
I wake up scared.

834
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:45,459
Sometimes it takes me a while
to remember where I am.

835
01:00:46,898 --> 01:00:51,578
Maybe I should get a gun and rob
the Food-Way so they'd send me home.

836
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:56,058
I could shoot the manager while
I was at it. Sort of like a bonus.

837
01:00:57,658 --> 01:01:01,457
I guess I'm too old
for that sort of nonsense anymore.

838
01:01:01,698 --> 01:01:03,377
I don't like it here.

839
01:01:03,578 --> 01:01:07,377
I'm tired of being afraid all the time.
I've decided...

840
01:01:08,217 --> 01:01:09,777
...not to stay.

841
01:01:20,256 --> 01:01:22,736
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss...

842
01:01:22,936 --> 01:01:26,255
...not for an old crook like me.

843
01:02:26,172 --> 01:02:30,291
"l doubt they'll kick up any fuss,
not for an old crook like me.

844
01:02:31,251 --> 01:02:34,931
P.S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry
I put a knife to his throat.

845
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:37,371
No hard feelings. Brooks."

846
01:02:47,410 --> 01:02:49,330
He should have died in here.

847
01:02:54,609 --> 01:02:55,969
What the fuck have you done?

848
01:02:56,169 --> 01:02:58,729
It's a goddamn mess,
I'll tell you that.

849
01:03:04,048 --> 01:03:07,608
-What's all this?
-You tell me. They're addressed to you.

850
01:03:08,848 --> 01:03:10,128
Take it.

851
01:03:18,288 --> 01:03:19,727
"Dear Mr. Dufresne:

852
01:03:20,847 --> 01:03:22,727
In response to your inquiries...

853
01:03:22,927 --> 01:03:27,007
...the state has allocated the enclosed
funds for your library project."

854
01:03:27,727 --> 01:03:29,487
This is $200.

855
01:03:29,687 --> 01:03:33,527
"In addition, the library district
has generously responded...

856
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:36,166
...with a donation of used books
and sundries.

857
01:03:36,366 --> 01:03:40,326
We trust this will fill your needs.
We now consider the matter closed.

858
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:42,286
Please stop sending us letters."

859
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:45,046
Clear all this out
before the warden gets back.

860
01:03:45,286 --> 01:03:46,406
Yes, sir.

861
01:03:50,485 --> 01:03:51,605
Good for you, Andy.

862
01:03:54,445 --> 01:03:55,525
Wow!

863
01:03:56,685 --> 01:03:58,565
It only took six years.

864
01:04:00,044 --> 01:04:02,684
From now on, I'll write two
letters a week instead of one.

865
01:04:02,884 --> 01:04:06,084
I believe you're crazy enough.
Get this stuff out...

866
01:04:06,324 --> 01:04:07,124
...like he said.

867
01:04:07,324 --> 01:04:08,684
I've got to pinch a loaf.

868
01:04:08,844 --> 01:04:10,284
When I come back...

869
01:04:10,443 --> 01:04:12,164
...this is all gone, all right?

870
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:00,240
Do you hear that?

871
01:06:06,155 --> 01:06:07,275
Dufresne!

872
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:11,195
Andy, let me out!

873
01:06:17,794 --> 01:06:22,513
I have no idea to this day what those
two Italian ladies were singing about.

874
01:06:22,793 --> 01:06:24,954
Truth is, I don't want to know.

875
01:06:25,153 --> 01:06:27,513
Some things are best left unsaid.

876
01:06:30,953 --> 01:06:33,593
I like to think it was something
so beautiful...

877
01:06:33,793 --> 01:06:35,832
...it can't be expressed in words...

878
01:06:36,033 --> 01:06:38,793
...and makes your heart ache
because of it.

879
01:06:40,392 --> 01:06:42,793
I tell you, those voices soared...

880
01:06:43,073 --> 01:06:47,191
...higher and farther than anybody
in a gray place dares to dream.

881
01:06:47,392 --> 01:06:50,592
It was like a beautiful bird
flapped into our drab cage...

882
01:06:50,791 --> 01:06:53,472
...and made those walls dissolve away.

883
01:06:53,872 --> 01:06:55,991
And for the briefest of moments...

884
01:06:56,191 --> 01:06:59,031
...every last man at Shawshank
felt free.

885
01:07:01,511 --> 01:07:04,070
It pissed the warden off
something awful.

886
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:06,270
Open the door.

887
01:07:09,070 --> 01:07:10,750
Open it up!

888
01:07:12,030 --> 01:07:14,629
Dufresne, open this door!

889
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:17,070
Turn that off!

890
01:07:23,869 --> 01:07:26,189
I am warning you. Turn that off!

891
01:07:43,228 --> 01:07:44,667
You're mine now.

892
01:07:51,827 --> 01:07:54,907
Andy got two weeks in the hole
for that little stunt.

893
01:07:55,107 --> 01:07:56,626
On your feet.

894
01:07:57,787 --> 01:08:00,066
-Hey, look who's here.
-Maestro!

895
01:08:01,787 --> 01:08:05,266
You couldn't play something good, huh?
Like Hank Williams?

896
01:08:05,626 --> 01:08:08,306
They broke the door down
before I could take requests.

897
01:08:08,506 --> 01:08:11,506
-Was it worth two weeks?
-Easiest time I ever did.

898
01:08:11,705 --> 01:08:15,705
-No such thing as easy time in the hole.
-A week in the hole is like a year.

899
01:08:15,906 --> 01:08:19,065
-Damn straight.
-I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.

900
01:08:19,265 --> 01:08:22,104
So they let you tote
that record player down there, huh?

901
01:08:24,464 --> 01:08:25,785
It was in here.

902
01:08:26,585 --> 01:08:27,744
In here.

903
01:08:28,824 --> 01:08:30,865
That's the beauty of music. They...

904
01:08:31,064 --> 01:08:33,304
...can't get that from you.

905
01:08:36,663 --> 01:08:38,944
Haven't you ever felt
that way about music?

906
01:08:40,663 --> 01:08:43,663
Well, I played a mean harmonica
as a younger man.

907
01:08:44,663 --> 01:08:46,303
Lost interest in it, though.

908
01:08:46,503 --> 01:08:48,022
Didn't make much sense in here.

909
01:08:48,343 --> 01:08:50,263
Here's where it makes the most sense.

910
01:08:50,782 --> 01:08:52,783
You need it so you don't forget.

911
01:08:53,302 --> 01:08:54,463
Forget?

912
01:08:54,822 --> 01:08:57,782
Forget that there are...

913
01:08:57,982 --> 01:08:59,382
...places...

914
01:08:59,862 --> 01:09:03,541
...in the world
that aren't made out of stone.

915
01:09:04,501 --> 01:09:05,901
There's something...

916
01:09:06,261 --> 01:09:07,582
...inside...

917
01:09:07,862 --> 01:09:09,741
...that they can't get to...

918
01:09:09,942 --> 01:09:11,221
...that they can't touch.

919
01:09:11,742 --> 01:09:13,141
That's yours.

920
01:09:14,581 --> 01:09:16,140
What are you talking about?

921
01:09:17,141 --> 01:09:18,301
Hope.

922
01:09:19,340 --> 01:09:20,621
Hope.

923
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:24,380
Let me tell you something, my friend.

924
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:27,380
Hope is a dangerous thing.

925
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:30,740
Hope can drive a man insane.

926
01:09:31,420 --> 01:09:33,459
It's got no use on the inside.

927
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:35,779
You'd better get used to that idea.

928
01:09:38,179 --> 01:09:39,619
Like Brooks did?

929
01:10:03,937 --> 01:10:04,897
Sit down.

930
01:10:10,017 --> 01:10:13,177
Says here that you've served
30 years of a life sentence.

931
01:10:14,296 --> 01:10:16,296
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

932
01:10:16,496 --> 01:10:17,656
Oh, yes, sir.

933
01:10:18,896 --> 01:10:20,176
Without a doubt.

934
01:10:21,296 --> 01:10:23,576
I can honestly say I'm a changed man.

935
01:10:25,496 --> 01:10:27,375
No danger to society here.

936
01:10:27,856 --> 01:10:29,335
God's honest truth.

937
01:10:31,815 --> 01:10:33,815
Absolutely rehabilitated.

938
01:10:43,414 --> 01:10:44,694
Thirty years.

939
01:10:46,574 --> 01:10:48,414
Jesus, when you say it like that....

940
01:10:49,214 --> 01:10:50,974
You wonder where it went.

941
01:10:53,293 --> 01:10:55,373
I wonder where 1 0 years went.

942
01:11:00,133 --> 01:11:01,133
Here.

943
01:11:01,533 --> 01:11:04,173
A little parole rejection present.

944
01:11:05,373 --> 01:11:07,012
Go ahead and open it.

945
01:11:08,092 --> 01:11:10,012
Went through one of your competitors.

946
01:11:10,212 --> 01:11:13,212
I hope you don't mind.
I wanted it to be a surprise.

947
01:11:22,852 --> 01:11:24,291
It's very pretty.

948
01:11:25,931 --> 01:11:27,091
Thank you.

949
01:11:29,531 --> 01:11:30,970
You going to play it?

950
01:11:35,331 --> 01:11:36,530
No.

951
01:11:40,010 --> 01:11:41,370
Not right now.

952
01:11:58,329 --> 01:11:59,368
Roll in!

953
01:12:34,086 --> 01:12:35,246
Lights out!

954
01:13:08,444 --> 01:13:10,483
Andy was as good as his word.

955
01:13:10,843 --> 01:13:13,523
He wrote two letters a week
instead of one.

956
01:13:15,483 --> 01:13:19,403
In 1959, the state senate
finally clued in to the fact...

957
01:13:19,643 --> 01:13:22,642
...they couldn't buy him off
with just a $200 check.

958
01:13:22,843 --> 01:13:26,962
Appropriations Committee
voted an annual payment of $500...

959
01:13:27,162 --> 01:13:29,002
...just to shut him up.

960
01:13:29,202 --> 01:13:32,042
And you'd be amazed how far
Andy could stretch it.

961
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:35,081
He made deals with book clubs,
charity groups.

962
01:13:35,281 --> 01:13:37,921
He bought remaindered books
by the pound....

963
01:13:38,401 --> 01:13:39,881
Treasure Island.

964
01:13:40,401 --> 01:13:41,681
Robert Louis--

965
01:13:41,841 --> 01:13:42,841
Stevenson.

966
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:44,361
Fiction, adventure.

967
01:13:46,801 --> 01:13:47,801
What's next?

968
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,920
I got here Auto Repair...

969
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:52,760
...and Soap Carving.

970
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:56,040
Trade skills and hobbies.
Under "Educational," behind you.

971
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:58,040
Count of Monte Crisco.

972
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:00,720
That's "Cristo," you dumb shit.

973
01:14:01,759 --> 01:14:02,719
By Alexandree...

974
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:04,359
...Dum-ass.

975
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:05,679
Dumb ass.

976
01:14:07,919 --> 01:14:08,919
Dumb ass?

977
01:14:11,718 --> 01:14:13,599
Dumas. Know what that's about?

978
01:14:15,758 --> 01:14:17,678
You'd like it.
It's about a prison break.

979
01:14:17,838 --> 01:14:21,598
We ought to file that
under "Educational" too, oughtn't we?

980
01:14:22,438 --> 01:14:26,358
The rest of us did our best
to pitch in when and where we could.

981
01:14:26,918 --> 01:14:28,597
By the year Kennedy was shot...

982
01:14:28,838 --> 01:14:33,157
...Andy had transformed a storage room
smelling of turpentine...

983
01:14:33,437 --> 01:14:36,396
...into the best prison library
in New England...

984
01:14:37,076 --> 01:14:39,917
...complete with a fine selection
of Hank Williams.

985
01:14:46,956 --> 01:14:48,836
That was also when Warden Norton...

986
01:14:49,036 --> 01:14:51,836
...instituted his famous
"Inside Out" program.

987
01:14:52,276 --> 01:14:54,275
You may remember reading about it.

988
01:14:54,476 --> 01:14:57,476
It made the papers
and got his picture in Look magazine.

989
01:14:57,675 --> 01:14:58,915
It's no free ride...

990
01:14:59,115 --> 01:15:02,195
..but rather a genuine
progressive advance...

991
01:15:02,395 --> 01:15:04,794
...in corrections and rehabilitation.

992
01:15:05,115 --> 01:15:07,554
Our inmates, properly supervised...

993
01:15:07,755 --> 01:15:10,274
...will be put to work
outside these walls...

994
01:15:10,474 --> 01:15:13,874
...performing all manner
of public service.

995
01:15:14,154 --> 01:15:16,274
These men can learn the value...

996
01:15:16,474 --> 01:15:20,114
...of an honest day's labor and
provide a service to the community...

997
01:15:20,313 --> 01:15:24,833
...at a bare minimum of expense
to Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer.

998
01:15:25,233 --> 01:15:27,473
Of course he didn't tell the press...

999
01:15:27,673 --> 01:15:30,992
...that "bare minimum of expense"
is a fairly loose term.

1000
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:34,113
There are 100 different ways
to skim off the top.

1001
01:15:34,312 --> 01:15:36,672
Men, materials, you name it.

1002
01:15:37,032 --> 01:15:39,792
And oh, my Lord,
how the money rolled in!

1003
01:15:39,992 --> 01:15:42,432
At this rate,
you'll put me out of business.

1004
01:15:42,631 --> 01:15:46,872
With this pool of slave labor,
you can underbid any contractor in town.

1005
01:15:47,431 --> 01:15:50,272
We're providing
a valuable community service.

1006
01:15:50,471 --> 01:15:53,951
That's fine for the papers,
but I've got a family to feed.

1007
01:15:56,551 --> 01:15:57,991
We go back a long way.

1008
01:15:59,270 --> 01:16:03,991
I need this highway contract. I don't
get it and I go under. That's a fact.

1009
01:16:04,870 --> 01:16:06,590
You have some of this fine pie...

1010
01:16:06,790 --> 01:16:09,990
...my missus made for you.
You think about that.

1011
01:16:17,949 --> 01:16:20,509
I wouldn't worry too much
about this contract.

1012
01:16:20,749 --> 01:16:23,709
I already got my boys
committed elsewhere.

1013
01:16:25,588 --> 01:16:28,508
You be sure and thank Maisie
for this fine pie.

1014
01:16:29,588 --> 01:16:31,668
And behind every shady deal...

1015
01:16:31,989 --> 01:16:34,508
...behind every dollar earned...

1016
01:16:34,788 --> 01:16:37,708
...there was Andy, keeping the books.

1017
01:16:38,108 --> 01:16:39,307
Two deposits.

1018
01:16:39,548 --> 01:16:43,508
Maine National and New England First.
Night drops as always, sir.

1019
01:17:12,466 --> 01:17:16,625
Get my stuff to the laundry. Two suits
for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.

1020
01:17:17,065 --> 01:17:20,464
If they over-starch my shirts again,
they'll hear from me.

1021
01:17:20,665 --> 01:17:21,944
How do I look?

1022
01:17:22,944 --> 01:17:25,304
-Very nice.
-Big charity to-do up Portland way.

1023
01:17:25,504 --> 01:17:26,984
Governor will be there.

1024
01:17:28,344 --> 01:17:29,744
You want the rest of this?

1025
01:17:31,024 --> 01:17:32,864
Woman can't bake worth shit.

1026
01:17:34,064 --> 01:17:35,344
Thank you, sir.

1027
01:17:38,063 --> 01:17:41,143
He's got his fingers
in a lot of pies, from what I hear.

1028
01:17:41,343 --> 01:17:45,983
He's got scams you haven't even
dreamed of. Kickbacks on his kickbacks.

1029
01:17:46,183 --> 01:17:48,462
A river of dirty money
running through here.

1030
01:17:48,663 --> 01:17:52,342
Sooner or later, he'll have to
explain where it came from.

1031
01:17:52,542 --> 01:17:54,222
That's where I come in.

1032
01:17:54,782 --> 01:17:57,022
I channel it. Filter it. Funnel it.

1033
01:17:57,181 --> 01:17:59,902
Stocks, securities,
tax-free municipals.

1034
01:18:00,221 --> 01:18:03,622
I send it out into the real world,
and when it comes back....

1035
01:18:03,821 --> 01:18:06,661
-Clean as a virgin's honeypot, huh?
-Cleaner.

1036
01:18:07,261 --> 01:18:10,701
By the time Norton retires,
I'll have made him a millionaire.

1037
01:18:12,941 --> 01:18:17,100
If they ever catch on, he'll wind up
in here wearing a number himself.

1038
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:19,941
I thought you had
more faith in me than that.

1039
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:23,060
I know you're good,
but all that paper leaves a trail.

1040
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:26,500
Now anybody gets curious,
FBI, IRS...

1041
01:18:26,699 --> 01:18:27,659
...whatever.

1042
01:18:28,059 --> 01:18:29,339
It'll lead to somebody.

1043
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:33,219
Sure it is, but not to me,
and certainly not to the warden.

1044
01:18:37,419 --> 01:18:38,379
All right, who?

1045
01:18:38,579 --> 01:18:40,099
Randall Stevens.

1046
01:18:40,619 --> 01:18:41,498
Who?

1047
01:18:41,699 --> 01:18:43,618
The "silent" silent partner.

1048
01:18:43,818 --> 01:18:46,738
He's the guilty one,
the man with the bank accounts.

1049
01:18:46,938 --> 01:18:49,018
It's where the filtering
process starts.

1050
01:18:49,218 --> 01:18:51,978
They trace anything,
it'll just lead to him.

1051
01:18:52,538 --> 01:18:53,738
But who is he?

1052
01:18:53,938 --> 01:18:57,737
He's a phantom, an apparition.
Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.

1053
01:18:58,777 --> 01:18:59,897
I conjured him...

1054
01:19:00,097 --> 01:19:01,417
...out of thin air.

1055
01:19:02,177 --> 01:19:04,816
He doesn't exist, except on paper.

1056
01:19:07,737 --> 01:19:10,016
You can't just make a person up.

1057
01:19:10,216 --> 01:19:13,176
Sure you can,
if you know how the system works.

1058
01:19:13,656 --> 01:19:16,376
It's amazing what you
can accomplish by mail.

1059
01:19:16,696 --> 01:19:19,215
Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate...

1060
01:19:19,416 --> 01:19:21,456
...driver's license, Social Security.

1061
01:19:21,736 --> 01:19:22,695
You're shitting me.

1062
01:19:22,896 --> 01:19:26,135
If they trace any accounts,
they'll wind up chasing...

1063
01:19:26,295 --> 01:19:27,975
...a figment of my imagination.

1064
01:19:28,175 --> 01:19:30,095
Well, I'll be damned!

1065
01:19:31,375 --> 01:19:33,015
Did I say you were good?

1066
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:34,935
Shit, you are Rembrandt.

1067
01:19:35,654 --> 01:19:37,295
The funny thing is...

1068
01:19:37,494 --> 01:19:41,454
...on the outside, I was an honest man,
straight as an arrow.

1069
01:19:41,814 --> 01:19:44,054
I had to come to prison to be a crook.

1070
01:19:52,573 --> 01:19:53,813
Ever bother you?

1071
01:19:55,213 --> 01:19:58,133
I don't run the scams.
I just process the profits.

1072
01:19:58,413 --> 01:20:00,333
A fine line, maybe...

1073
01:20:00,853 --> 01:20:02,852
...but I also built that library...

1074
01:20:03,053 --> 01:20:05,932
...and used it to help guys
get their high school diploma.

1075
01:20:06,132 --> 01:20:08,293
Why do you think
he lets me do all that?

1076
01:20:08,492 --> 01:20:10,572
Keep you happy and doing the laundry.

1077
01:20:10,771 --> 01:20:12,212
Money instead of sheets.

1078
01:20:12,532 --> 01:20:15,051
Well, I work cheap.
That's the tradeoff.

1079
01:20:31,571 --> 01:20:34,090
Tommy Williams
came to Shawshank in 1965...

1080
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:36,490
...on a two-year stretch for B and E.

1081
01:20:36,689 --> 01:20:38,930
That's breaking and entering to you.

1082
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:43,250
Cops caught him sneaking TV sets
out the back door of a JC Penney.

1083
01:20:43,689 --> 01:20:44,929
Young punk.

1084
01:20:45,129 --> 01:20:46,690
Mr. Rock 'n' Roll...

1085
01:20:46,889 --> 01:20:48,329
...cocky as hell.

1086
01:20:48,529 --> 01:20:50,849
Come on, old boys.
Moving like molasses!

1087
01:20:51,088 --> 01:20:52,769
Making me look bad.

1088
01:20:52,969 --> 01:20:54,688
We liked him immediately.

1089
01:20:54,928 --> 01:20:58,489
I'm backing out the door
and I got the TV like this.

1090
01:20:58,768 --> 01:21:02,248
A big old thing. I couldn't see shit.
Then I hear this voice.

1091
01:21:02,888 --> 01:21:04,768
"Freeze, kid, hands in the air."

1092
01:21:04,968 --> 01:21:09,247
I was standing there, holding onto
that TV. Finally the voice says:

1093
01:21:09,448 --> 01:21:13,087
"You hear what I said, boy?"
I say, "Yes, sir. I did.

1094
01:21:13,288 --> 01:21:16,607
But if I drop this, you get me
on destruction of property too."

1095
01:21:20,886 --> 01:21:23,086
You done some stretch
in Cashman, right?

1096
01:21:23,567 --> 01:21:27,366
Yeah, that was an easy piece of time,
let me tell you.

1097
01:21:27,646 --> 01:21:29,486
Weekend furloughs.
Work programs.

1098
01:21:29,686 --> 01:21:30,725
Not like here.

1099
01:21:30,926 --> 01:21:33,246
Sounds like you done time all over.

1100
01:21:33,645 --> 01:21:35,965
I've been in and out since I was 1 3.

1101
01:21:36,166 --> 01:21:38,246
Name it, chances are I've been there.

1102
01:21:38,445 --> 01:21:41,006
Perhaps you should try a new profession.

1103
01:21:42,405 --> 01:21:43,885
What I mean is...

1104
01:21:44,205 --> 01:21:47,525
...you're not a very good thief.
You should try something else.

1105
01:21:47,725 --> 01:21:50,845
Yeah, what the hell
you know about it, Capone?

1106
01:21:51,244 --> 01:21:52,764
What are you in for?

1107
01:21:53,004 --> 01:21:53,964
Me?

1108
01:21:56,324 --> 01:21:57,924
A lawyer fucked me.

1109
01:22:01,644 --> 01:22:04,523
Everybody's innocent in here.
Don't you know that?

1110
01:22:12,083 --> 01:22:16,322
As it turned out, Tommy had himself
a young wife and a new baby girl.

1111
01:22:16,842 --> 01:22:18,882
Maybe he thought of them
on the streets...

1112
01:22:19,082 --> 01:22:21,482
...or his child growing up
not knowing her daddy.

1113
01:22:21,802 --> 01:22:23,082
Whatever it was...

1114
01:22:23,402 --> 01:22:25,762
...something lit a fire
under that boy's ass.

1115
01:22:29,441 --> 01:22:32,201
Thought I might try for
my high school equivalency.

1116
01:22:32,361 --> 01:22:34,801
Hear you helped
a couple of fellas with that.

1117
01:22:36,081 --> 01:22:38,241
I don't waste time with losers, Tommy.

1118
01:22:39,561 --> 01:22:41,960
I ain't no goddamn loser.

1119
01:22:43,641 --> 01:22:45,400
-You mean that?
-Yeah.

1120
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,360
You really mean that?

1121
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:50,680
Yes, sir, I do.

1122
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:52,759
Good. Because if we do this...

1123
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:56,759
...we do it all the way,
a hundred percent, nothing half-assed.

1124
01:22:56,999 --> 01:22:58,719
Thing is, see...

1125
01:22:59,919 --> 01:23:01,399
...I don't read so good.

1126
01:23:02,519 --> 01:23:03,559
"Well."

1127
01:23:05,479 --> 01:23:07,158
You don't read...

1128
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:08,838
...so well.

1129
01:23:11,079 --> 01:23:12,518
We'll get to that.

1130
01:23:16,798 --> 01:23:18,838
So Andy took Tommy under his wing.

1131
01:23:19,038 --> 01:23:21,557
Started walking him through his ABC's.

1132
01:23:23,598 --> 01:23:25,717
Tommy took to it pretty well too.

1133
01:23:25,957 --> 01:23:28,637
Boy found brains he never knew he had.

1134
01:23:30,876 --> 01:23:34,157
Before long, Andy started him
on his course requirements.

1135
01:23:34,357 --> 01:23:35,956
He really liked the kid.

1136
01:23:36,157 --> 01:23:39,556
Gave him a thrill to help a youngster
crawl off the shit heap.

1137
01:23:40,037 --> 01:23:42,236
But that wasn't the only reason.

1138
01:23:42,916 --> 01:23:44,995
Prison time is slow time.

1139
01:23:45,476 --> 01:23:47,956
So you do what you can to keep going.

1140
01:23:48,276 --> 01:23:50,235
Some fellas collect stamps.

1141
01:23:50,635 --> 01:23:52,995
Others build matchstick houses.

1142
01:23:53,595 --> 01:23:56,155
Andy built a library.

1143
01:23:56,635 --> 01:23:58,475
Now he needed a new project.

1144
01:23:59,315 --> 01:24:00,755
Tommy was it.

1145
01:24:01,354 --> 01:24:05,194
It was the same reason he spent years
shaping and polishing those rocks.

1146
01:24:05,714 --> 01:24:08,794
The same reason he hung
his fantasy girlies on the wall.

1147
01:24:09,674 --> 01:24:10,874
In prison...

1148
01:24:11,154 --> 01:24:14,714
...a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1149
01:24:15,473 --> 01:24:20,153
By 1966, right about the time Tommy
was getting ready to take his exams...

1150
01:24:20,354 --> 01:24:22,473
...it was lovely Raquel.

1151
01:24:38,351 --> 01:24:39,311
Time.

1152
01:24:45,111 --> 01:24:46,071
Well?

1153
01:24:47,591 --> 01:24:49,631
Well, it's for shit.

1154
01:24:50,111 --> 01:24:52,831
I wasted a whole year
of my time with this bullshit.

1155
01:24:53,030 --> 01:24:54,471
It's probably not that bad.

1156
01:24:54,670 --> 01:24:58,710
I didn't get a thing right.
It might as well have been in Chinese.

1157
01:24:58,911 --> 01:25:00,590
Let's see how the score comes out.

1158
01:25:00,790 --> 01:25:03,630
I'll tell you
how the goddamn score comes out.

1159
01:25:05,470 --> 01:25:06,790
Two points, right there!

1160
01:25:06,990 --> 01:25:08,470
There's your goddamn score!

1161
01:25:08,709 --> 01:25:12,269
Goddamn cats crawling up trees,
5 times 5 is 25....

1162
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:14,709
Fuck this place!

1163
01:25:14,949 --> 01:25:16,029
Fuck it!

1164
01:25:34,428 --> 01:25:35,628
I feel bad.

1165
01:25:35,827 --> 01:25:36,947
I let him down.

1166
01:25:37,148 --> 01:25:38,828
That's crap, kid.

1167
01:25:39,027 --> 01:25:40,307
He's proud of you.

1168
01:25:40,627 --> 01:25:43,387
We're old friends,
I know him as good as anybody.

1169
01:25:43,547 --> 01:25:45,067
Smart fellow, ain't he?

1170
01:25:45,267 --> 01:25:48,267
Smart as they come.
He was a banker on the outside.

1171
01:25:48,466 --> 01:25:50,587
What's he in here for anyway?

1172
01:25:50,906 --> 01:25:51,866
Murder.

1173
01:25:53,266 --> 01:25:54,587
The hell, you say.

1174
01:25:56,626 --> 01:25:58,865
You wouldn't think it
to look at the guy.

1175
01:26:00,026 --> 01:26:03,985
Caught his wife in bed
with some golf pro. Greased them both.

1176
01:26:11,665 --> 01:26:12,625
What?

1177
01:26:13,905 --> 01:26:16,345
About four years ago...

1178
01:26:16,625 --> 01:26:19,704
...I was in Thomaston
on a two-to-three stretch.

1179
01:26:20,184 --> 01:26:21,465
I stole a car.

1180
01:26:21,784 --> 01:26:23,704
It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.

1181
01:26:24,344 --> 01:26:26,504
About six months left to go...

1182
01:26:26,784 --> 01:26:28,623
...I get a new cellmate in.

1183
01:26:29,304 --> 01:26:30,863
Elmo Blatch.

1184
01:26:31,543 --> 01:26:32,823
Big, twitchy fucker.

1185
01:26:33,623 --> 01:26:36,983
Kind of roomie you pray you don't get.
You know what I'm saying?

1186
01:26:37,183 --> 01:26:39,823
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

1187
01:26:40,063 --> 01:26:42,222
Said he pulled hundreds of jobs.

1188
01:26:42,423 --> 01:26:47,182
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.
You cut a loud fart, he jumped three feet.

1189
01:26:48,182 --> 01:26:52,621
Talked all the time too. That's
the other thing. He never shut up.

1190
01:26:52,822 --> 01:26:54,382
Places he'd been in...

1191
01:26:54,701 --> 01:26:57,621
...jobs he'd pulled, women he fucked.

1192
01:26:57,861 --> 01:26:59,981
Even people he killed.

1193
01:27:01,141 --> 01:27:03,861
People who "gave him shit."

1194
01:27:04,461 --> 01:27:05,940
That's how he put it.

1195
01:27:08,461 --> 01:27:10,421
So one night, like a joke...

1196
01:27:11,501 --> 01:27:14,860
...I say to him,
"Elmo, who did you kill?"

1197
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:16,140
So he says:

1198
01:27:16,341 --> 01:27:20,140
I got me this job one time,
busing tables at a country club...

1199
01:27:20,780 --> 01:27:24,499
...so I could case all these big
rich pricks that come in.

1200
01:27:26,539 --> 01:27:28,459
So I pick out this guy...

1201
01:27:29,299 --> 01:27:30,819
...go in one night...

1202
01:27:31,019 --> 01:27:32,659
...and do his place.

1203
01:27:34,058 --> 01:27:35,339
He wakes up...

1204
01:27:36,019 --> 01:27:37,739
...and gives me shit.

1205
01:27:38,738 --> 01:27:40,339
So I killed him.

1206
01:27:42,058 --> 01:27:44,778
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

1207
01:27:46,098 --> 01:27:48,298
And that's the best part.

1208
01:27:48,938 --> 01:27:51,298
She's fucking this prick, see...

1209
01:27:51,497 --> 01:27:54,417
...this golf pro,
but she's married to some other guy.

1210
01:27:55,018 --> 01:27:57,457
Some hotshot banker.

1211
01:27:58,857 --> 01:28:01,257
And he's the one they pinned it on.

1212
01:28:12,256 --> 01:28:15,976
I have to say that's
the most amazing story I ever heard.

1213
01:28:17,176 --> 01:28:19,575
What amazes me most
is you'd be taken in by it.

1214
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:21,216
Sir?

1215
01:28:23,375 --> 01:28:26,815
It's obvious this fellow Williams
is impressed with you.

1216
01:28:27,375 --> 01:28:31,175
He hears your tale of woe
and naturally wants to cheer you up.

1217
01:28:31,374 --> 01:28:33,415
He's young, not terribly bright.

1218
01:28:33,934 --> 01:28:37,254
It's not surprising he wouldn't
know what a state he put you in.

1219
01:28:37,614 --> 01:28:39,134
Sir, he's telling the truth.

1220
01:28:39,854 --> 01:28:43,853
Let's say for the moment
this Blatch does exist.

1221
01:28:44,133 --> 01:28:48,573
You think he'd just fall to his knees
and cry, "Yes, I did it. I confess.

1222
01:28:48,774 --> 01:28:51,333
By the way,
add a life term to my sentence."

1223
01:28:51,533 --> 01:28:54,253
With Tommy's testimony,
I can get a new trial.

1224
01:28:54,412 --> 01:28:56,813
That's assuming Blatch is still there.

1225
01:28:57,013 --> 01:28:58,893
Chances are, he'd be released by now.

1226
01:28:59,053 --> 01:29:01,452
They'd have his last known address.

1227
01:29:01,612 --> 01:29:03,492
It's a chance, isn't it?

1228
01:29:05,732 --> 01:29:07,372
How can you be so obtuse?

1229
01:29:08,291 --> 01:29:09,251
What?

1230
01:29:10,692 --> 01:29:12,092
What did you call me?

1231
01:29:12,291 --> 01:29:13,931
Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

1232
01:29:14,292 --> 01:29:15,731
You're forgetting yourself.

1233
01:29:16,051 --> 01:29:18,891
The country club
will have his old timecards.

1234
01:29:19,051 --> 01:29:21,730
Records, W-2s with his name on them.

1235
01:29:21,931 --> 01:29:24,490
If you want to indulge this fantasy,
it's your business.

1236
01:29:24,691 --> 01:29:27,171
Don't make it mine.
This meeting is over.

1237
01:29:27,370 --> 01:29:29,890
If I got out, I'd never mention
what happens here.

1238
01:29:30,490 --> 01:29:33,330
I'd be as indictable as you
for laundering that money.

1239
01:29:35,130 --> 01:29:37,929
Don't ever mention money to me,
you son of a bitch!

1240
01:29:38,130 --> 01:29:39,729
Not in this office...

1241
01:29:39,930 --> 01:29:41,769
...not anywhere.
Get in here, now!

1242
01:29:42,009 --> 01:29:44,609
I just wanted to put you at ease,
that's all.

1243
01:29:45,209 --> 01:29:46,409
Solitary. A month.

1244
01:29:47,368 --> 01:29:48,608
What's wrong with you?

1245
01:29:48,809 --> 01:29:50,089
Get him out of here.

1246
01:29:50,248 --> 01:29:51,768
This is my chance to get out!

1247
01:29:51,969 --> 01:29:53,688
It's my life! Understand?!

1248
01:29:53,888 --> 01:29:55,849
Get him out!

1249
01:29:57,568 --> 01:29:59,448
A month in the hole.

1250
01:29:59,648 --> 01:30:02,208
That's the longest stretch
I ever heard of.

1251
01:30:02,408 --> 01:30:03,687
It's all my fault.

1252
01:30:03,847 --> 01:30:05,408
Bullshit.

1253
01:30:06,047 --> 01:30:08,608
You didn't pull the trigger
or convict him.

1254
01:30:08,807 --> 01:30:11,127
Are you saying Andy is innocent?

1255
01:30:11,327 --> 01:30:13,247
I mean, for real innocent?

1256
01:30:13,447 --> 01:30:14,727
It looks that way.

1257
01:30:15,167 --> 01:30:16,967
Sweet Jesus.

1258
01:30:17,247 --> 01:30:19,007
How long has he been here now?

1259
01:30:19,366 --> 01:30:22,526
1 947. What is that?
Nineteen years.

1260
01:30:22,727 --> 01:30:25,246
-Williams, Thomas.
-Yeah, over here.

1261
01:30:30,845 --> 01:30:31,965
What you got?

1262
01:30:32,566 --> 01:30:33,846
Board of Education.

1263
01:30:34,045 --> 01:30:35,486
That son of a bitch mailed it.

1264
01:30:35,685 --> 01:30:39,485
You going to open it or stand there
with your thumb up your butt?

1265
01:30:39,685 --> 01:30:41,765
Thumb up my butt sounds better.

1266
01:30:42,244 --> 01:30:44,964
Skeets, come on.
Give me that, you shithead.

1267
01:30:45,765 --> 01:30:47,044
Floyd, come on.

1268
01:30:52,284 --> 01:30:54,563
Will you throw that away, please?

1269
01:30:59,963 --> 01:31:01,603
Well, shit.

1270
01:31:13,762 --> 01:31:16,442
The kid passed. C + average.

1271
01:31:16,642 --> 01:31:18,682
Thought you'd like to know.

1272
01:31:34,241 --> 01:31:35,641
Warden wants to talk.

1273
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:49,839
Out here?

1274
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:52,160
That's what the man said.

1275
01:32:07,639 --> 01:32:08,599
Warden?

1276
01:32:18,198 --> 01:32:22,077
I'm asking you to keep this conversation
just between us.

1277
01:32:23,517 --> 01:32:25,717
I feel awkward enough as it is.

1278
01:32:43,396 --> 01:32:45,395
We got a situation here.

1279
01:32:46,235 --> 01:32:48,236
I think you can appreciate that.

1280
01:32:48,435 --> 01:32:49,595
Yes, sir.

1281
01:32:49,875 --> 01:32:51,195
I sure can.

1282
01:32:51,475 --> 01:32:55,315
I tell you, son, this thing really
came along and knocked my wind out.

1283
01:32:56,755 --> 01:32:59,195
It's got me up nights.
That's the truth.

1284
01:33:01,395 --> 01:33:03,154
The right thing to do...

1285
01:33:04,754 --> 01:33:08,314
...sometimes it's hard to know
what that is.

1286
01:33:09,273 --> 01:33:10,674
Do you understand?

1287
01:33:12,873 --> 01:33:14,393
I need your help, son.

1288
01:33:15,793 --> 01:33:17,874
If I'm going to move on this...

1289
01:33:18,193 --> 01:33:21,233
...there can't be
the least little shred of doubt.

1290
01:33:21,913 --> 01:33:22,953
I have to know...

1291
01:33:23,153 --> 01:33:25,673
...if what you told Dufresne
was the truth.

1292
01:33:25,872 --> 01:33:26,952
Yes, sir.

1293
01:33:27,152 --> 01:33:28,312
Absolutely.

1294
01:33:28,792 --> 01:33:31,672
Would you be willing to swear
before a judge and jury...

1295
01:33:31,872 --> 01:33:33,791
...with your hand on the Good Book...

1296
01:33:33,992 --> 01:33:36,551
...and take an oath
before Almighty God himself?

1297
01:33:36,752 --> 01:33:38,471
Just give me that chance.

1298
01:33:42,552 --> 01:33:43,831
That's what I thought.

1299
01:34:28,988 --> 01:34:30,828
I'm sure by now you've heard.

1300
01:34:32,507 --> 01:34:33,507
Terrible thing.

1301
01:34:35,027 --> 01:34:36,468
A man that young...

1302
01:34:36,787 --> 01:34:39,267
...less than a year to go,
trying to escape.

1303
01:34:39,787 --> 01:34:42,187
Broke Captain Hadley's heart
to shoot him.

1304
01:34:42,867 --> 01:34:44,306
Truly, it did.

1305
01:34:47,186 --> 01:34:49,546
We just have to put it behind us.

1306
01:34:51,146 --> 01:34:52,306
Move on.

1307
01:34:53,866 --> 01:34:55,306
I'm done.

1308
01:34:56,546 --> 01:34:58,106
Everything stops.

1309
01:34:59,985 --> 01:35:02,226
Get someone else to run your scams.

1310
01:35:03,466 --> 01:35:05,225
Nothing stops.

1311
01:35:06,505 --> 01:35:07,625
Nothing.

1312
01:35:10,865 --> 01:35:13,865
Or you will do
the hardest time there is.

1313
01:35:14,224 --> 01:35:16,464
No more protection from the guards.

1314
01:35:16,664 --> 01:35:21,384
I'll pull you out of that 1 -bunk Hilton
and cast you down with the sodomites.

1315
01:35:22,703 --> 01:35:25,063
You'll think you've been
fucked by a train.

1316
01:35:26,384 --> 01:35:27,823
And the library?

1317
01:35:28,463 --> 01:35:29,423
Gone.

1318
01:35:30,023 --> 01:35:32,463
Sealed off, brick by brick.

1319
01:35:32,943 --> 01:35:35,462
We'll have us a little
book barbecue in the yard.

1320
01:35:35,663 --> 01:35:37,703
They'll see the flames for miles.

1321
01:35:37,903 --> 01:35:40,623
We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.

1322
01:35:41,863 --> 01:35:44,742
You understand me? Catching my drift?

1323
01:35:48,302 --> 01:35:50,102
Or am I being obtuse?

1324
01:36:01,421 --> 01:36:03,941
Give him another month
to think about it.

1325
01:36:48,777 --> 01:36:51,698
My wife used to say
I'm a hard man to know.

1326
01:36:52,457 --> 01:36:54,217
Like a closed book.

1327
01:36:55,017 --> 01:36:56,936
Complained about it all the time.

1328
01:36:57,857 --> 01:36:59,337
She was beautiful.

1329
01:37:01,656 --> 01:37:03,136
God, I loved her.

1330
01:37:06,696 --> 01:37:08,816
I didn't know how
to show it, that's all.

1331
01:37:11,455 --> 01:37:13,056
I killed her, Red.

1332
01:37:14,856 --> 01:37:16,575
I didn't pull the trigger...

1333
01:37:17,935 --> 01:37:19,615
...but I drove her away.

1334
01:37:21,054 --> 01:37:23,615
That's why she died, because of me...

1335
01:37:23,814 --> 01:37:25,135
...the way I am.

1336
01:37:33,774 --> 01:37:35,534
That don't make you a murderer.

1337
01:37:38,773 --> 01:37:40,453
Bad husband, maybe.

1338
01:37:43,973 --> 01:37:47,093
Feel bad about it if you want,
but you didn't pull the trigger.

1339
01:37:47,293 --> 01:37:48,573
No, I didn't.

1340
01:37:48,933 --> 01:37:50,813
Somebody else did.

1341
01:37:51,973 --> 01:37:54,012
And I wound up in here.

1342
01:37:56,372 --> 01:37:57,892
Bad luck, I guess.

1343
01:38:02,891 --> 01:38:04,291
It floats around.

1344
01:38:05,251 --> 01:38:07,411
It's got to land on somebody.

1345
01:38:08,291 --> 01:38:10,091
It was my turn, that's all.

1346
01:38:10,771 --> 01:38:13,411
I was in the path of the tornado.

1347
01:38:19,131 --> 01:38:22,930
I just didn't expect the storm
would last as long as it has.

1348
01:38:27,090 --> 01:38:28,730
Think you'll ever get out of here?

1349
01:38:29,890 --> 01:38:30,889
Me?

1350
01:38:33,730 --> 01:38:34,690
Yeah.

1351
01:38:35,969 --> 01:38:38,209
One day, when I got
a long, white beard...

1352
01:38:38,369 --> 01:38:41,409
...and two or three marbles
rolling around upstairs.

1353
01:38:43,368 --> 01:38:44,929
I tell you where I'd go.

1354
01:38:46,368 --> 01:38:47,928
Zihuatanejo.

1355
01:38:48,768 --> 01:38:49,928
Say what?

1356
01:38:50,208 --> 01:38:51,968
Zihuatanejo.

1357
01:38:52,888 --> 01:38:54,488
It's in Mexico.

1358
01:38:55,808 --> 01:38:57,848
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

1359
01:38:58,928 --> 01:39:01,607
You know what the Mexicans say
about the Pacific?

1360
01:39:03,327 --> 01:39:05,247
They say it has no memory.

1361
01:39:07,167 --> 01:39:09,686
That's where I want to live
the rest of my life.

1362
01:39:11,287 --> 01:39:13,686
A warm place with no memory.

1363
01:39:16,766 --> 01:39:18,646
Open up a little hotel...

1364
01:39:20,286 --> 01:39:21,686
...right on the beach.

1365
01:39:22,286 --> 01:39:24,406
Buy some worthless old boat...

1366
01:39:24,925 --> 01:39:26,486
...and fix it up new.

1367
01:39:29,085 --> 01:39:30,285
Take my guests out...

1368
01:39:31,085 --> 01:39:32,405
...charter fishing.

1369
01:39:36,085 --> 01:39:37,725
Zihuatanejo.

1370
01:39:41,124 --> 01:39:44,844
In a place like that, I could use
a man that knows how to get things.

1371
01:39:51,123 --> 01:39:53,843
I don't think I could make it
on the outside.

1372
01:40:00,243 --> 01:40:02,203
I been in here most of my life.

1373
01:40:03,602 --> 01:40:05,283
I'm an institutional man now.

1374
01:40:06,163 --> 01:40:07,803
Just like Brooks was.

1375
01:40:09,242 --> 01:40:10,843
You underestimate yourself.

1376
01:40:11,402 --> 01:40:12,922
I don't think so.

1377
01:40:16,602 --> 01:40:20,402
In here I'm the guy who can get things
for you, sure, but...

1378
01:40:21,122 --> 01:40:23,561
...outside all you need
is the Yellow Pages.

1379
01:40:23,761 --> 01:40:25,881
Hell, I wouldn't know
where to begin.

1380
01:40:27,961 --> 01:40:29,521
Pacific Ocean?

1381
01:40:29,881 --> 01:40:31,081
Shit.

1382
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:33,520
Scare me to death,
something that big.

1383
01:40:33,721 --> 01:40:34,961
Not me.

1384
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:38,800
I didn't shoot my wife,
and I didn't shoot her lover.

1385
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:43,560
Whatever mistakes I made,
I've paid for them and then some.

1386
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:45,999
That hotel, that boat....

1387
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:49,839
I don't think that's too much to ask.

1388
01:40:54,519 --> 01:40:56,879
You shouldn't be doing this to yourself.

1389
01:40:57,078 --> 01:40:58,998
This is just shitty pipe dreams.

1390
01:40:59,438 --> 01:41:01,798
Mexico is way down there
and you're in here...

1391
01:41:01,999 --> 01:41:03,479
...and that's the way it is.

1392
01:41:03,798 --> 01:41:06,518
Yeah, right.
That's the way it is.

1393
01:41:07,958 --> 01:41:10,278
It's down there and I'm in here.

1394
01:41:12,758 --> 01:41:15,357
I guess it comes down
to a simple choice.

1395
01:41:18,157 --> 01:41:19,597
Get busy living...

1396
01:41:20,917 --> 01:41:22,837
...or get busy dying.

1397
01:41:34,476 --> 01:41:37,076
If you ever get out of here,
do me a favor.

1398
01:41:37,275 --> 01:41:39,436
Sure, Andy. Anything.

1399
01:41:41,235 --> 01:41:44,955
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton.
You know where Buxton is?

1400
01:41:46,355 --> 01:41:49,355
-A lot of hayfields up there.
-One in particular.

1401
01:41:49,555 --> 01:41:53,354
It's got a long rock wall
with a big oak tree at the north end.

1402
01:41:53,555 --> 01:41:56,275
It's like something
out of a Robert Frost poem.

1403
01:41:57,194 --> 01:41:59,594
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

1404
01:42:00,914 --> 01:42:02,954
We went there for a picnic...

1405
01:42:03,313 --> 01:42:05,354
...and made love under that oak...

1406
01:42:05,994 --> 01:42:08,113
...and I asked and she said yes.

1407
01:42:11,953 --> 01:42:13,713
Promise me, Red.

1408
01:42:14,513 --> 01:42:16,072
If you ever get out...

1409
01:42:16,273 --> 01:42:17,713
...find that spot.

1410
01:42:18,832 --> 01:42:23,473
At the base of that wall, there's a rock
that has no earthly business in Maine.

1411
01:42:24,592 --> 01:42:27,472
Piece of black, volcanic glass.

1412
01:42:30,032 --> 01:42:32,592
Something's buried under it
I want you to have.

1413
01:42:33,351 --> 01:42:34,511
What, Andy?

1414
01:42:34,952 --> 01:42:36,591
What's buried under there?

1415
01:42:38,151 --> 01:42:39,951
You'll have to pry it up...

1416
01:42:40,111 --> 01:42:41,351
...to see.

1417
01:42:46,991 --> 01:42:48,870
No, I'm telling you. The guy is....

1418
01:42:49,511 --> 01:42:51,151
He's talking funny.

1419
01:42:52,230 --> 01:42:53,830
I'm really worried about him.

1420
01:42:54,230 --> 01:42:55,630
Let's keep an eye on him.

1421
01:42:55,790 --> 01:42:58,950
That's fine during the day,
but at night he's all alone.

1422
01:43:00,310 --> 01:43:01,389
Oh, Lord.

1423
01:43:02,670 --> 01:43:03,469
What?

1424
01:43:04,909 --> 01:43:07,589
Andy come down
to the loading dock today.

1425
01:43:07,789 --> 01:43:09,789
He asked me for a length of rope.

1426
01:43:09,989 --> 01:43:10,789
Rope?

1427
01:43:10,989 --> 01:43:12,549
Six feet long.

1428
01:43:12,789 --> 01:43:14,108
And you gave it to him.

1429
01:43:14,948 --> 01:43:16,669
Sure. Why wouldn't l?

1430
01:43:16,868 --> 01:43:18,348
Jesus! Heywood.

1431
01:43:18,948 --> 01:43:20,828
How was I supposed to know?

1432
01:43:21,028 --> 01:43:22,508
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

1433
01:43:24,428 --> 01:43:26,307
Andy would never do that.

1434
01:43:26,867 --> 01:43:27,908
Never.

1435
01:43:29,867 --> 01:43:31,147
I don't know.

1436
01:43:33,867 --> 01:43:35,827
Every man has his breaking point.

1437
01:43:38,067 --> 01:43:40,227
Lickety-split.
Want to get home.

1438
01:43:40,547 --> 01:43:42,226
Just about finished, sir.

1439
01:43:58,665 --> 01:44:00,225
Three deposits tonight.

1440
01:44:07,864 --> 01:44:09,704
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1441
01:44:09,865 --> 01:44:11,424
And shine my shoes.

1442
01:44:11,624 --> 01:44:14,464
-I want them looking like mirrors.
-Yes, sir.

1443
01:44:19,744 --> 01:44:21,144
It's good having you back.

1444
01:44:22,023 --> 01:44:23,823
Place wasn't the same without you.

1445
01:45:08,780 --> 01:45:09,820
Lights out!

1446
01:45:41,297 --> 01:45:43,737
I've had some long nights in stir.

1447
01:45:44,258 --> 01:45:46,777
Alone in the dark
with nothing but your thoughts...

1448
01:45:46,977 --> 01:45:49,537
...time can draw out like a blade.

1449
01:45:54,657 --> 01:45:57,537
That was the longest night of my life.

1450
01:46:12,735 --> 01:46:13,855
Give me a count!

1451
01:46:18,175 --> 01:46:20,894
Tier 3 south, clear!

1452
01:46:23,934 --> 01:46:26,934
Man missing on tier 2, cell 245!

1453
01:46:27,134 --> 01:46:28,174
Dufresne!

1454
01:46:28,694 --> 01:46:31,014
Come out. You're holding up the show!

1455
01:46:34,014 --> 01:46:37,294
Don't make me come down
or I'll thump your skull for you!

1456
01:46:44,573 --> 01:46:48,253
Damn it, you're putting me behind!
I got a schedule to keep.

1457
01:46:48,413 --> 01:46:51,573
You'd better be sick or dead in there.
I shit you not!

1458
01:46:51,772 --> 01:46:53,052
You hear me?

1459
01:46:58,932 --> 01:47:00,932
Oh, my Holy God.

1460
01:47:17,211 --> 01:47:19,690
I want every man
on this cellblock questioned.

1461
01:47:20,090 --> 01:47:22,570
-Start with that friend of his.
-Who?

1462
01:47:25,050 --> 01:47:26,530
Open 237.

1463
01:47:29,889 --> 01:47:33,409
What do you mean, "He just wasn't here"?
Don't say that to me.

1464
01:47:34,250 --> 01:47:35,529
Don't tell me that again.

1465
01:47:35,729 --> 01:47:36,689
But sir, he wasn't.

1466
01:47:36,929 --> 01:47:40,249
I can see that, Haig!
Think I'm blind?

1467
01:47:40,888 --> 01:47:42,248
Is that what you're saying?

1468
01:47:42,449 --> 01:47:45,008
-Am I blind, Haig?
-No, sir!

1469
01:47:45,848 --> 01:47:48,249
What about you. You blind?

1470
01:47:48,728 --> 01:47:51,208
-Tell me what this is.
-Last night's count.

1471
01:47:51,407 --> 01:47:54,567
You see Dufresne's name there?
I sure do. Right there.

1472
01:47:54,768 --> 01:47:56,048
"Dufresne."

1473
01:47:57,647 --> 01:47:59,047
He was in his cell...

1474
01:47:59,287 --> 01:48:00,207
...at lights out.

1475
01:48:00,407 --> 01:48:02,567
Reasonable he'd be here in the morning.

1476
01:48:03,567 --> 01:48:05,126
I want him found.

1477
01:48:05,327 --> 01:48:08,647
Not tomorrow, not after breakfast. Now!

1478
01:48:08,886 --> 01:48:10,007
Yes, sir.

1479
01:48:10,966 --> 01:48:13,166
Let's go. Move your butts.

1480
01:48:16,406 --> 01:48:17,366
Stand.

1481
01:48:18,766 --> 01:48:19,766
Well?

1482
01:48:23,086 --> 01:48:24,006
Well, what?

1483
01:48:24,245 --> 01:48:27,565
I see you two all the time.
You're thick as thieves, you are.

1484
01:48:28,565 --> 01:48:30,005
He must have said something.

1485
01:48:30,725 --> 01:48:32,205
No, sir, Warden.

1486
01:48:32,564 --> 01:48:33,485
Not a word.

1487
01:48:35,245 --> 01:48:37,684
Lord, it's a miracle!

1488
01:48:38,285 --> 01:48:40,724
Man vanished like a fart in the wind.

1489
01:48:41,364 --> 01:48:42,484
Nothing left...

1490
01:48:43,284 --> 01:48:45,924
...but some damn rocks
on a windowsill.

1491
01:48:46,124 --> 01:48:48,724
And that cupcake on the wall.
Let's ask her.

1492
01:48:48,923 --> 01:48:50,604
Maybe she knows.

1493
01:48:50,843 --> 01:48:53,483
What say there, fuzzy-britches?
Feel like talking?

1494
01:48:54,843 --> 01:48:56,083
Guess not.

1495
01:48:56,643 --> 01:48:58,762
Why should she be any different?

1496
01:48:59,763 --> 01:49:01,362
This is a conspiracy.

1497
01:49:02,003 --> 01:49:03,722
That's what this is.

1498
01:49:04,323 --> 01:49:07,882
One big, damn conspiracy!

1499
01:49:08,162 --> 01:49:10,082
And everyone's in on it!

1500
01:49:10,681 --> 01:49:11,802
Including her!

1501
01:49:45,399 --> 01:49:47,039
In 1966...

1502
01:49:47,239 --> 01:49:49,519
...Andy Dufresne escaped...

1503
01:49:49,719 --> 01:49:51,239
...from Shawshank Prison.

1504
01:49:53,358 --> 01:49:55,838
All they found
was a muddy set of prison clothes...

1505
01:49:56,439 --> 01:49:57,918
...a bar of soap...

1506
01:49:58,119 --> 01:49:59,598
...and an old rock hammer...

1507
01:49:59,798 --> 01:50:02,158
...damn near worn down to the nub.

1508
01:50:06,478 --> 01:50:11,077
I had thought it'd take a man 600 years
to tunnel through the wall with it.

1509
01:50:11,678 --> 01:50:14,197
Old Andy did it in less than 20.

1510
01:50:31,756 --> 01:50:33,955
Oh, Andy loved geology.

1511
01:50:34,676 --> 01:50:37,716
I imagine it appealed to his
meticulous nature.

1512
01:50:38,115 --> 01:50:39,875
An ice age here...

1513
01:50:40,275 --> 01:50:42,675
...million years
of mountain building there.

1514
01:50:43,635 --> 01:50:46,355
Geology is the study
of pressure and time.

1515
01:50:47,155 --> 01:50:49,074
That's all it takes, really.

1516
01:50:49,795 --> 01:50:50,834
Pressure...

1517
01:50:51,435 --> 01:50:52,674
...and time.

1518
01:50:53,955 --> 01:50:55,914
That and a big goddamn poster.

1519
01:50:59,794 --> 01:51:00,713
Like I said...

1520
01:51:01,194 --> 01:51:04,993
...in prison, a man will do anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1521
01:51:07,713 --> 01:51:12,313
Seems Andy's favorite hobby was toting
his wall out into the exercise yard...

1522
01:51:12,833 --> 01:51:14,672
...a handful at a time.

1523
01:51:15,912 --> 01:51:17,913
I guess after Tommy was killed...

1524
01:51:18,112 --> 01:51:20,953
...Andy decided
he'd been here long enough.

1525
01:51:21,152 --> 01:51:23,592
Lickety-split.
I want to get home.

1526
01:51:24,312 --> 01:51:26,272
I'm just about finished, sir.

1527
01:51:46,830 --> 01:51:48,710
Three deposits tonight.

1528
01:51:55,709 --> 01:51:57,909
Andy did like he was told.

1529
01:51:58,110 --> 01:52:01,430
Buffed those shoes
to a high mirror-shine.

1530
01:52:04,989 --> 01:52:07,189
The guards simply didn't notice.

1531
01:52:07,468 --> 01:52:08,868
Neither did l.

1532
01:52:09,069 --> 01:52:10,548
I mean, seriously...

1533
01:52:10,749 --> 01:52:13,629
...how often do you really look
at a man's shoes?

1534
01:54:12,100 --> 01:54:15,140
Andy crawled to freedom
through 500 yards...

1535
01:54:15,379 --> 01:54:18,579
...of shit-smelling foulness
I can't even imagine.

1536
01:54:19,539 --> 01:54:21,778
Or maybe I just don't want to.

1537
01:54:25,979 --> 01:54:28,258
Five hundred yards.

1538
01:54:28,738 --> 01:54:31,698
That's the length
of five football fields.

1539
01:54:32,298 --> 01:54:34,738
Just shy of half a mile.

1540
01:55:27,733 --> 01:55:32,133
The next morning, right about the time
Raquel was spilling her secret...

1541
01:55:32,413 --> 01:55:35,133
...a man nobody ever
laid eyes on before...

1542
01:55:35,374 --> 01:55:37,853
...strolled into
the Maine National Bank.

1543
01:55:38,413 --> 01:55:41,452
Until that moment,
he didn't exist.

1544
01:55:41,973 --> 01:55:44,253
-Except on paper.
-May I help you?

1545
01:55:44,653 --> 01:55:46,493
He had all the proper ID...

1546
01:55:46,692 --> 01:55:50,252
...driver's license, birth certificate,
Social Security card....

1547
01:55:50,652 --> 01:55:53,091
And the signature
was a spot-on match.

1548
01:55:53,292 --> 01:55:56,251
I must say I'm sorry
to be losing your business.

1549
01:55:56,452 --> 01:55:58,091
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.

1550
01:55:58,891 --> 01:55:59,932
Thank you.

1551
01:56:00,571 --> 01:56:01,691
I'm sure I will.

1552
01:56:02,571 --> 01:56:05,771
Here's your cashier's check, sir.
Will there be anything else?

1553
01:56:05,971 --> 01:56:06,891
Please.

1554
01:56:07,451 --> 01:56:09,850
Would you add this
to your outgoing mail?

1555
01:56:10,331 --> 01:56:11,490
I'd be happy to.

1556
01:56:13,211 --> 01:56:14,490
Good day, sir.

1557
01:56:15,410 --> 01:56:19,650
Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks
in the Portland area that morning.

1558
01:56:20,090 --> 01:56:21,610
All told, he blew town...

1559
01:56:21,810 --> 01:56:26,449
...with better than $370,000
of Warden Norton's money.

1560
01:56:27,129 --> 01:56:29,769
Severance pay for 19 years.

1561
01:56:36,728 --> 01:56:38,849
Good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.

1562
01:57:29,524 --> 01:57:32,365
Byron Hadley?
You have the right to remain silent.

1563
01:57:32,605 --> 01:57:36,844
If you give up this right, anything you
say can be held against you in court.

1564
01:57:37,284 --> 01:57:41,564
I wasn't there to see, but I hear
Byron Hadley sobbed like a girl...

1565
01:57:41,764 --> 01:57:43,164
...when they took him away.

1566
01:57:48,843 --> 01:57:52,083
Norton had no intention
of going that quietly.

1567
01:58:07,282 --> 01:58:08,082
Samuel Norton.

1568
01:58:08,842 --> 01:58:11,201
We have a warrant
for your arrest. Open up.

1569
01:58:15,722 --> 01:58:16,801
Open the door.

1570
01:58:17,321 --> 01:58:18,521
I'm not sure which key.

1571
01:58:28,240 --> 01:58:30,121
Make it easy on yourself, Norton!

1572
01:58:41,159 --> 01:58:44,439
I like to think the last thing
that went through his head...

1573
01:58:44,679 --> 01:58:46,199
...other than that bullet...

1574
01:58:46,399 --> 01:58:50,639
...was to wonder how the hell
Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.

1575
01:58:53,038 --> 01:58:56,358
Not long after the warden
deprived us of his company...

1576
01:58:56,638 --> 01:58:58,598
...I got a postcard in the mail.

1577
01:59:00,038 --> 01:59:02,718
It was blank,
but the postmark said...

1578
01:59:02,917 --> 01:59:04,958
...Fort Hancock, Texas.

1579
01:59:05,478 --> 01:59:06,797
Fort Hancock...

1580
01:59:07,077 --> 01:59:08,717
...right on the border.

1581
01:59:09,117 --> 01:59:10,997
That's where Andy crossed.

1582
01:59:11,557 --> 01:59:15,517
When I picture him heading south
in his own car with the top down...

1583
01:59:15,877 --> 01:59:17,996
...it always makes me laugh.

1584
01:59:19,757 --> 01:59:21,277
Andy Dufresne...

1585
01:59:21,636 --> 01:59:23,556
...who crawled through
a river of shit...

1586
01:59:23,756 --> 01:59:26,076
...and came out clean
on the other side.

1587
01:59:26,876 --> 01:59:28,155
Andy Dufresne...

1588
01:59:28,956 --> 01:59:30,475
...headed for the Pacific.

1589
01:59:33,316 --> 01:59:35,396
Hadley's got him
by the throat, right?

1590
01:59:35,595 --> 01:59:39,235
He says, "l believe this boy's
about to have himself an accident."

1591
01:59:39,435 --> 01:59:42,195
Those of us who knew him best
talk about him often.

1592
01:59:42,834 --> 01:59:44,474
I swear, the stuff he pulled....

1593
01:59:44,675 --> 01:59:47,514
"My friends could use
a couple of beers."

1594
01:59:47,834 --> 01:59:49,434
And he got it!

1595
01:59:50,594 --> 01:59:52,914
Sometimes it makes me sad, though...

1596
01:59:53,154 --> 01:59:54,554
...Andy being gone.

1597
01:59:55,234 --> 01:59:59,193
I have to remind myself that
some birds aren't meant to be caged.

1598
01:59:59,634 --> 02:00:01,594
Their feathers are just too bright.

1599
02:00:03,234 --> 02:00:04,913
And when they fly away...

1600
02:00:05,313 --> 02:00:09,553
...the part of you that knows it was
a sin to lock them up does rejoice.

1601
02:00:10,593 --> 02:00:11,792
But still...

1602
02:00:12,232 --> 02:00:16,393
...the place you live in is that much
more drab and empty that they're gone.

1603
02:00:20,432 --> 02:00:22,712
I guess I just miss my friend.

1604
02:00:46,390 --> 02:00:47,270
Please sit down.

1605
02:00:52,870 --> 02:00:54,390
Ellis Boyd Redding...

1606
02:00:54,909 --> 02:00:58,029
...your files say you've served
40 years of a life sentence.

1607
02:00:58,789 --> 02:01:00,829
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

1608
02:01:02,629 --> 02:01:04,148
Rehabilitated?

1609
02:01:06,108 --> 02:01:07,908
Well, now, let me see.

1610
02:01:08,868 --> 02:01:11,108
I don't have any idea
what that means.

1611
02:01:13,148 --> 02:01:15,308
It means you're ready
to rejoin society--

1612
02:01:15,868 --> 02:01:18,068
I know what you think it means, sonny.

1613
02:01:20,188 --> 02:01:22,067
To me it's just a made-up word.

1614
02:01:23,387 --> 02:01:25,587
A politician's word so that...

1615
02:01:26,027 --> 02:01:29,427
...young fellas like yourself
can wear a suit and a tie...

1616
02:01:29,867 --> 02:01:31,387
...and have a job.

1617
02:01:33,307 --> 02:01:35,306
What do you really want to know?

1618
02:01:36,026 --> 02:01:37,946
Am I sorry for what I did?

1619
02:01:38,346 --> 02:01:39,466
Well, are you?

1620
02:01:41,306 --> 02:01:43,986
There's not a day goes by
I don't feel regret.

1621
02:01:45,305 --> 02:01:48,625
Not because I'm in here
or because you think I should.

1622
02:01:51,985 --> 02:01:54,425
I look back on the way I was then...

1623
02:01:56,505 --> 02:01:57,585
...a young...

1624
02:01:58,665 --> 02:02:02,024
...stupid kid who committed
that terrible crime.

1625
02:02:04,904 --> 02:02:06,544
I want to talk to him.

1626
02:02:08,384 --> 02:02:10,744
I want to try
and talk some sense to him.

1627
02:02:11,464 --> 02:02:13,303
Tell him the way things are.

1628
02:02:15,343 --> 02:02:16,703
But I can't.

1629
02:02:18,823 --> 02:02:20,743
That kid's long gone...

1630
02:02:21,903 --> 02:02:24,542
...and this old man is all that's left.

1631
02:02:25,902 --> 02:02:27,302
I got to live with that.

1632
02:02:28,623 --> 02:02:30,222
Rehabilitated?

1633
02:02:30,582 --> 02:02:32,342
It's just a bullshit word.

1634
02:02:33,262 --> 02:02:37,821
So you go on and stamp your forms,
sonny, and stop wasting my time.

1635
02:02:39,022 --> 02:02:41,181
Because to tell you the truth...

1636
02:02:41,502 --> 02:02:43,422
...I don't give a shit.

1637
02:04:06,415 --> 02:04:07,735
Here you go, miss.

1638
02:04:10,574 --> 02:04:11,534
Restroom break?

1639
02:04:17,134 --> 02:04:21,454
You don't need to ask me every time
you need to go take a piss. Just go.

1640
02:04:33,973 --> 02:04:36,933
Forty years I've been asking
permission to piss.

1641
02:04:37,732 --> 02:04:40,572
I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.

1642
02:04:43,972 --> 02:04:46,052
There's a harsh truth to face.

1643
02:04:47,652 --> 02:04:50,412
No way I'm going to make it
on the outside.

1644
02:04:57,972 --> 02:05:01,531
All I do anymore is think of ways
to break my parole...

1645
02:05:02,291 --> 02:05:04,651
...so maybe they'd send me back.

1646
02:05:09,650 --> 02:05:12,010
Terrible thing, to live in fear.

1647
02:05:12,850 --> 02:05:14,449
Brooks Hatlen knew it.

1648
02:05:14,650 --> 02:05:16,490
Knew it all too well.

1649
02:05:18,049 --> 02:05:21,290
All I want is to be back
where things make sense.

1650
02:05:21,729 --> 02:05:24,329
Where I won't have to be afraid
all the time.

1651
02:05:26,249 --> 02:05:28,529
Only one thing stops me.

1652
02:05:29,929 --> 02:05:32,209
A promise I made to Andy.

1653
02:05:51,888 --> 02:05:52,967
There it is.

1654
02:06:03,166 --> 02:06:04,767
Much obliged, sir.

1655
02:09:35,070 --> 02:09:36,271
Dear Red:

1656
02:09:36,511 --> 02:09:38,871
If you're reading this,
you've gotten out...

1657
02:09:39,070 --> 02:09:42,990
...and if you've come this far,
maybe you'd come a bit further.

1658
02:09:43,230 --> 02:09:45,590
You remember the name
of the town, don't you?

1659
02:09:47,829 --> 02:09:49,229
Zihuatanejo.

1660
02:09:50,829 --> 02:09:54,269
I could use a good man
to help me get my project on wheels.

1661
02:09:54,749 --> 02:09:58,149
I'll keep an eye out for you,
and the chessboard ready.

1662
02:09:58,908 --> 02:10:00,269
Remember, Red...

1663
02:10:00,588 --> 02:10:02,589
...hope is a good thing...

1664
02:10:02,788 --> 02:10:04,708
...maybe the best of things.

1665
02:10:04,909 --> 02:10:06,989
And no good thing ever dies.

1666
02:10:07,508 --> 02:10:10,228
I will be hoping
that this letter finds you...

1667
02:10:10,427 --> 02:10:12,107
...and finds you well.

1668
02:10:12,588 --> 02:10:13,747
Your friend...

1669
02:10:13,948 --> 02:10:15,068
...Andy.

1670
02:10:47,505 --> 02:10:49,185
"Get busy living...

1671
02:10:49,385 --> 02:10:51,184
...or get busy dying. "

1672
02:10:53,784 --> 02:10:55,864
That's goddamn right.

1673
02:11:00,904 --> 02:11:02,944
For the second time in my life...

1674
02:11:03,184 --> 02:11:05,624
...I'm guilty of committing a crime.

1675
02:11:06,663 --> 02:11:08,503
Parole violation.

1676
02:11:09,143 --> 02:11:12,663
Of course I doubt they'll toss up
any roadblocks for that.

1677
02:11:13,303 --> 02:11:15,263
Not for an old crook like me.

1678
02:11:15,463 --> 02:11:17,383
Fort Hancock, Texas, please.

1679
02:11:20,942 --> 02:11:25,462
I find I'm so excited I can barely
sit still or hold a thought in my head.

1680
02:11:25,902 --> 02:11:29,062
I think it's the excitement
only a free man can feel.

1681
02:11:29,262 --> 02:11:31,662
A free man at the start
of a long journey...

1682
02:11:31,862 --> 02:11:34,342
...whose conclusion is uncertain.

1683
02:11:37,261 --> 02:11:39,781
I hope I can make it across the border.

1684
02:11:41,261 --> 02:11:44,141
I hope to see my friend
and shake his hand.

1685
02:11:45,941 --> 02:11:49,860
I hope the Pacific is as blue
as it has been in my dreams.

1686
02:11:51,621 --> 02:11:52,740
I hope.
