1
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:23,526
You are confused, aren't you?
Frightened.

2
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,258
That's all right. I can help you.

3
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,287
Who is this?

4
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:28,357
I am a doctor.
Now, you must listen to me.

5
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:31,063
You have lost your memory.
There was an experiment.

6
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,004
Something went wrong.
Your memory was erased.

7
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,028
Do you understand me?

8
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:36,166
No, I don't understand.
What the hell is going on here?

9
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,734
Just listen. There are people
coming for you even as we speak.

10
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,713
You must not let them find you.
You must leave now.

11
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:45,246
Hello? Are you there?

12
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,812
Hey, Mr. Murdoch.
The Automat called.

13
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,780
Said you left your wallet there.

14
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:53,014
I suggest you retrieve it since
you only paid for 3 weeks...

15
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,917
and they was up 10 minutes ago.

16
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,615
I've been here 3 weeks?

17
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:00,990
It's right there in
black and white, Mr. Murdoch.

18
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,423
Day and date.

19
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,588
We make our books like we make
our beds, all neat and tidy.

20
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,464
I'll take care of it when I get back.

21
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,663
See that you do.
Only thing makes you a guest...

22
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,036
in this joint, pal,
is cash on the barrelhead.

23
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,555
House rules.
3 weeks is 3 weeks.

24
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,364
No days off for good behavior.

25
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:08,987
Mr. Murdoch, yes, where is he?

26
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:12,725
He just left not 5 minutes ago.

27
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,895
Sleep now.

28
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:24,237
# When marimba rhythms
start to play #

29
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,336
# Dance with me #

30
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:29,371
# Make me sway #

31
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:33,545
# Like a lazy ocean
hugs the shore #

32
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,781
# Hold me close #

33
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:38,586
# Sway me more #

34
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:42,890
# Like a flower
bending in the breeze #

35
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,329
# Bend with me #

36
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:48,265
# Sway with ease #

37
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:52,465
# When we dance
you have a way with me #

38
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:54,700
# Stay with me #

39
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,174
# Sway with me #

40
00:07:58,077 --> 00:07:59,066
Hey, sweetie!

41
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:02,139
He said he was your
husband's doctor.

42
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:03,648
He wanted to speak with you.

43
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,025
Excuse me.

44
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,067
Dr. Sh--

45
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:31,133
Schreber. Please,
won't you come in?

46
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,270
You must be Emma Murdoch.

47
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,308
Thank you for coming to see me
on such short notice.

48
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:40,847
What is this?

49
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:45,814
A rather crude experiment...
designed to further my studies.

50
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,018
I don't understand.

51
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:52,156
You say you're my husband's doctor,
but he never mentioned you to me.

52
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,529
The truth is, Mrs. Murdoch...

53
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:56,034
John has been coming to
see me for quite some time.

54
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:59,799
He had been grappling
with feelings of betrayal...

55
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,967
stemming from your
marital difficulties.

56
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,170
- John told you what happened?
- Yes.

57
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:08,543
When was the last time
that you saw him?

58
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:10,048
3 weeks ago.

59
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:13,848
He packed a suitcase.
He was very angry at me.

60
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,878
I understand how difficult
this must be for you.

61
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,550
But for John's sake,
I would like you...

62
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,219
to think of me
as your friend, Emma.

63
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:25,026
It appears that John has suffered
a psychotic break.

64
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,292
Complete memory loss.

65
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,959
He may be delusional.

66
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,902
Even violent.

67
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,371
Emma...

68
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:37,837
if he were to contact you,
and I suspect he will...

69
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,744
you must call me immediately.
Do you understand?

70
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:45,149
It is imperative that I be
the first one to reach him.

71
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:48,517
Wherever your husband is,
he is searching...

72
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,414
...for himself.

73
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,400
Good evening, Mr. Murdoch.

74
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,201
It is Mr. Murdoch, isn't it?

75
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:11,107
Mr.--was it
"J"--something--Murdoch?

76
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:15,240
J. Murdoch.

77
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,773
What's your name? Justin? Jerry?

78
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,847
No.

79
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:24,581
My name's Jason Murdoch.
John Murdoch.

80
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,057
Jake Murdoch. How's it going?

81
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,252
Hi. Jack Murdoch.

82
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:31,552
Hi.

83
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:12,768
Bumstead.

84
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,670
I told the guy,
"Cash on the barrelhead."

85
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:21,168
I said, "Listen, 3 weeks is 3 weeks."

86
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:22,441
Where's our lucky winner?

87
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:25,314
Upstairs, sir, room 614.

88
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,115
Another call girl.

89
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,679
"J. Murdoch."

90
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,586
Evening, Husselbeck.

91
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:34,957
Inspector Bumstead.

92
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,928
Your lace is untied.

93
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,224
Sir.

94
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:51,632
Am I glad you're here, sir.

95
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:54,305
They say Detective Walenski's
got the heebie-jeebies.

96
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,610
Just take what they give me,
Husselbeck.

97
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:07,791
Wow. Looks like somebody
woke up on the wrong side of the bed.

98
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,395
- Hello.
- Oh, it's you.

99
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,838
You left your wallet here, buddy.

100
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,171
When did I do that?

101
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,334
When you was last here.

102
00:12:57,376 --> 00:13:00,504
- When was that?
- When you left your wallet.

103
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,309
You expect me to remember?

104
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:08,348
Hello. Excuse me.

105
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,256
No, no, seriously.

106
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:15,526
Alleged?

107
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,869
- Where you headed, chief?
- Home.

108
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:32,935
And where's home?

109
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,742
Haven't you mugs got
anything better to do?

110
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:38,045
Well, I'm just trying
to do my job, May.

111
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,142
There's a killer out there
in case you hadn't noticed.

112
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,882
Maybe you should be out looking for him
instead of cooling your heels, huh?

113
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:47,885
Go on, get out of here.

114
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:57,224
Come on.

115
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:00,667
Round and round she goes.

116
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:07,204
Where she stops? Nobody knows.

117
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:13,510
What's that make so far, Husselbeck?
6 hookers in all?

118
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,019
I believe so, sir.

119
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,579
Give the man an "A" for effort.

120
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,853
You'd think these stiffs
would have the good grace...

121
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,019
to expire at a good time of night.

122
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,996
Hey, too bad about Walenski, huh?

123
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,191
I guess he'd seen enough.

124
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,298
So, Husselbeck...

125
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:46,116
what kind of killer do you think
stops to save a dying fish?

126
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:47,140
You've got me, sir.

127
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,313
Bumstead, what took you?

128
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:52,620
This killer's been running circles
around us thanks to Walenski.

129
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,421
With all due respect,
Chief lnspector...

130
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,452
I've known Eddie a long time.
He's a good cop.

131
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:01,694
Whatever kind of cop Walenski once was,
he let drift a long time ago.

132
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,565
Let me talk to Bumstead!

133
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:04,967
Come on, let's go.

134
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,369
Hold on!

135
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,703
Frank, Frank!

136
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:11,301
Get his arm!

137
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:12,332
They're watching us!

138
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:13,402
On your feet.

139
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:14,878
There's no way out!

140
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,245
Don't make us hurt you.

141
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,011
God, can't you see?!

142
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:22,718
Let me go, let me go!

143
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,222
I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm not--

144
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,521
- What was that?
- Walenski.

145
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:39,064
I'm being punished for my sins, right?

146
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,470
What did I ever do to inherit this?

147
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:42,599
Where do you begin?

148
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:47,635
Well, everything Detective Walenski
committed to paper should be here, so--

149
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,172
The only thing that should
be committed is Walenski.

150
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,117
Nothing like a little healthy paranoia.

151
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:01,785
Sir, we just got
the fingerprint results in.

152
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,927
What is this, some kind of joke?

153
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,535
Don't throw anything away.

154
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:19,769
Inspector Bumstead.

155
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,777
I came here to file
a missing persons report for my husband.

156
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,451
Take it to the front desk.

157
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,317
They told me to come see you.

158
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,285
His name's John Murdoch.

159
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,352
Mrs. Murdoch,
why didn't you report this before?

160
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:42,595
I mean, if your husband has been missing
as long as you say...

161
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:45,330
I thought he'd simply
walked out on me.

162
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:50,464
Then a...doctor contacted me
this evening.

163
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,136
How long have you been married?

164
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,474
Nearly four years.

165
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,445
Why do you ask?

166
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:59,576
Because you seem uncomfortable
with your ring.

167
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:03,281
As if you were...
unaccustomed to wearing it.

168
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:04,755
No, I never take it off.

169
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:15,357
Do these names
mean anything to you?

170
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,606
No. Who are these women?

171
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:25,204
Why are you looking
for my husband?

172
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:27,776
Are you going to accuse him
of something?

173
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,111
Maybe. Maybe murder.

174
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,173
Whose murder?

175
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:36,281
- Which one?
- All of them.

176
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,451
Mrs. Murdoch,
I am sorry, I'm sorry.

177
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:40,549
I didn't mean to alarm you.

178
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:43,152
I'm so sorry that I came.
Just both made a mistake.

179
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:44,662
Mrs. Murdoch, if you please.

180
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:47,130
If you'll just give me
half a second to explain--

181
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:51,458
I'll be right out.

182
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:17,925
Have we met before?

183
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:21,592
If we did...
I hope you're still breathing.

184
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:23,260
What's your name, honey?

185
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,302
John.

186
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,802
Well, that's an appropriate name.

187
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,697
Yeah.

188
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,043
I was just thinking.

189
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:43,812
What you do...

190
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:48,356
seems kind of dangerous...

191
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:50,384
right now.

192
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,158
I mean, how do you know
I'm not the killer?

193
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:55,394
You don't seem like
the killer type. Why?

194
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:59,127
You feeling any urges
I should know about?

195
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,251
Aw, shoot.

196
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:24,650
So it seems you've discovered
your unpleasant nature.

197
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:28,850
Who are you?

198
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:32,557
We might ask
the same question, yes?

199
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:35,192
Sleep now.

200
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,892
He can tune.

201
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,280
What is to be done?
This man is dangerous.

202
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,252
It is said he is able to tune.

203
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:02,651
Impossible.

204
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:05,486
We have seen it
with our own eyes.

205
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,958
On occasion the imprinting
does not take.

206
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,962
They behave erratically
when they awaken.

207
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:14,625
We find them wandering
like lost children.

208
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,827
But this one was different, yes?

209
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:18,563
What has the doctor
to say about this?

210
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:20,594
He has failed to report in.

211
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:23,767
- And Mr. Quick?
- No more Mr. Quick.

212
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:26,801
Mr. Quick, dead, yes.

213
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,442
Poor, poor Mr. Quick.

214
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:35,351
Mr. Book, does he know?

215
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,519
Should we not know, Mr. Hand?

216
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:42,358
We had hoped to learn more
before sharing with you.

217
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:45,329
We can know nothing
until we possess him.

218
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:48,958
Mr. Night, you will take the East.

219
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,798
Mr. Face, you the West.

220
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,930
Mr. Glove, the South.

221
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:56,202
Mr. Shade, the North.

222
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:00,712
We must have this man.

223
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:19,353
Do you really think my husband could be
capable of committing those murders?

224
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,956
Do you?

225
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:26,492
Let's hope, for both our sakes,
that I'm wrong.

226
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,861
John.

227
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:12,342
I've been so worried about you.

228
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:17,847
Are you punishing me?

229
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:20,483
You know, if disappearing
is your way of punishing me...

230
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:21,617
I don't appreciate it.

231
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,719
I don't know what
you're talking about.

232
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:29,056
I found these keys in my pocket...

233
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,796
so I assume I live here.

234
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,600
You supposed to be my wife?

235
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,663
Supposed to be?

236
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:37,732
John.

237
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:40,006
You really...

238
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:43,276
don't know who I am, do you?

239
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,509
Your doctor called me.

240
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:46,039
He was worried
that this might happen.

241
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:47,574
My doctor?

242
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:50,144
Yeah. He...

243
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:52,213
he gave me his card.

244
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:54,782
He's desperate to find you.

245
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,351
Schreber.

246
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,759
I feel like I'm living out
someone else's nightmare.

247
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:06,566
What happened to me?
Why was I seeing a doctor?

248
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:09,432
I had an affair.

249
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,943
You were angry at me.

250
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,245
The police are looking for you.

251
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:19,580
I know. I saw the papers.

252
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:22,178
"Killer stalks city streetwalkers."

253
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:29,285
I was with one of those women...

254
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:31,124
before I came here tonight.

255
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:33,457
I don't understand.

256
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:34,965
I met her outside an Automat.

257
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:39,028
I guess I wanted to test myself.

258
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:43,006
I wanted to know if I had it in me
to do those things.

259
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:47,637
Maybe I have lost my mind, but whoever
I am, I'm still me and I'm not a killer.

260
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:55,953
I believe you.

261
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,016
You do?

262
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,216
What?

263
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:06,059
The car outside,
the one you arrived in.

264
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:08,429
It's a cop.
He dropped me off here.

265
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,197
I didn't know he was still here.

266
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,262
John.

267
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,304
Hold it right there, mister!

268
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:21,679
Wait. You have the wrong man.

269
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:22,839
Stand aside, will you, please?

270
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:24,473
I didn't kill anyone.

271
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:27,610
Right now what you are
is a suspect. Turn yourself in.

272
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:30,111
I'll listen to whatever
you have to say.

273
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:32,055
You're not gonna believe
what I have to say.

274
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:34,250
Try me.

275
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:36,417
There's someone after me.

276
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:39,589
There's this group of men.
They want me dead.

277
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:42,259
And I don't even know if--
They're not even--

278
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:45,264
Yeah, who's gonna
listen to a madman?

279
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:47,100
Stand aside, Mrs. Murdoch.

280
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:48,264
Run!

281
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,840
No one ever listens to me.

282
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:01,511
Murdoch, stop!

283
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:07,956
Murdoch!

284
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,151
How much further?

285
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:46,720
We're almost there, buddy.

286
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:52,733
Hey, you happen to know
the way to Shell Beach?

287
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:55,672
You're kidding. Me and the missus
spent our honeymoon there.

288
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:58,437
All you gotta do is take
Main Street west to--

289
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,974
Or is it the cross--

290
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:06,643
You know, that's funny.
I can't seem to remember...

291
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,983
if it's Main Street west
or the cross-town.

292
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:17,185
I'm sorry, lnspector,
I cannot be of more assistance...

293
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:19,093
but I am running late
for an appointment.

294
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,325
Well, I appreciate
your taking the time.

295
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:31,939
There's just one thing
that puzzles me.

296
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:36,640
I've met quite a few murderers
in the course of my work.

297
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:39,343
Murdoch doesn't strike me as one.

298
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:43,047
Perhaps you are not
accustomed to digging deep enough.

299
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:45,613
Well, I do know when someone
is lying to me, Doctor.

300
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:48,285
Forgive me, lnspector,
but you are not a clinician.

301
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:52,057
Judging personalities
happens to be my business.

302
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:54,122
Well, maybe you could
give me a few pointers.

303
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:55,996
Certainly.

304
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:58,059
Let's take you, for instance.

305
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:01,470
You are a fastidious man, driven.

306
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,565
Consumed by details.

307
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:06,242
I would say your life is...

308
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:08,534
rather lonely.

309
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:11,907
Good evening, lnspector.
I really must be going.

310
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:57,625
Closing time.
The pool is now closed.

311
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:05,391
Dr. Schreber.

312
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:11,802
Most unfortunate it is that we were
forced to seek you out here.

313
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:15,406
You know how uncomfortable
we find all this...

314
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:17,376
moisture.

315
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,979
- I'm sorry. I--
- Failed to report in, yes.

316
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:23,647
I was frightened.
I have a weak heart, you know.

317
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:27,556
Your weakness is not, we think,
an affair of the heart.

318
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:30,254
We found this
in his hotel room.

319
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:34,231
Must we reproduce
Mr. Murdoch's memories again?

320
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:35,323
I tried to imprint him...

321
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:37,493
but he woke up, he knocked the syringe
right out of my hand.

322
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:39,628
I tried to stop him but he was too fast.

323
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,831
He has no memories, then?

324
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:44,239
Only fragments.
The procedure, it was interrupted.

325
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:48,075
I guess it's only a matter
of rounding him up.

326
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:49,670
You have had strays
before, right?

327
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:53,343
This is no stray, Doctor.
This one can tune.

328
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:56,583
But that's impossible.
I thought only you had that ability.

329
00:30:56,621 --> 00:31:00,921
You will process another template
of the subject's memories, yes?

330
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,688
Of course. I'll imprint him again.

331
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:07,221
No. We require them
for a quite different purpose.

332
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:10,534
It's almost midnight,
Dr. Schreber.

333
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:13,002
We'll talk again
after tonight's tuning, but...

334
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:15,368
no more delays, yes?

335
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:20,207
No more inconsistencies
in your behavior.

336
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,586
You appear quite frail, Doctor.

337
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:34,848
Perhaps some exercise
would do you good.

338
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:49,632
- Come in.
- Kate.

339
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,407
- How is he?
- The same.

340
00:31:57,782 --> 00:32:00,376
Walenski? It's me, Frank.

341
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:08,214
Come in, Frank.

342
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,995
Close the door.

343
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:23,805
I've been looking through
some of your old reports.

344
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:25,866
It's an interesting case.

345
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:31,880
The kind that can make
a man's career...

346
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,110
or break it.

347
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:35,483
Yeah, I was on that case.

348
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,786
And then what?
What happened then, Eddie?

349
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:41,655
Nothing happened, Frank.

350
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:45,823
I've just been spending time
on the subway, riding in circles.

351
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:47,763
Thinking in circles.

352
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:49,758
There's no way out.

353
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:53,434
I've been over every inch
of this city.

354
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:00,542
You're scaring your wife
to death, Eddie.

355
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:02,273
She's not my wife.

356
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:06,750
I don't know who she is.
I don't know who any of us are.

357
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:08,718
What makes you say that?

358
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:10,812
Do you think about
the past much, Frank?

359
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,757
As much as the next guy.

360
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:17,487
See, I've been trying
to remember things--

361
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:20,224
clearly remember things
from my past.

362
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:25,702
But the more I try to think back,
the more it all starts to unravel.

363
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,068
None of it seems real.

364
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:30,472
It's like I've just been
dreaming this life...

365
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:34,069
and when I finally wake up
I'll be somebody else.

366
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:35,943
Somebody totally different.

367
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,381
You saw something,
didn't you, Eddie?

368
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:46,413
Something to do with the case.

369
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,483
There is no case.
There never was!

370
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:54,965
It's all just a big joke!
It's a joke!

371
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,204
Tonight's requirements are...

372
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:43,009
12 family photo albums,
9 personal diaries...

373
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:47,984
17 love letters,
assorted childhood photographs...

374
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:52,115
26 wallets,
lD's and social security cards.

375
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:54,249
These do bring back memories.

376
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:58,857
This one is still warm.

377
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:00,693
What is it?

378
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:03,928
The recollections of a great lover?

379
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:06,994
A catalog of conquests?

380
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:08,528
We will soon find out.

381
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:14,537
You wouldn't appreciate that,
would you, Mr. Whatever your name is?

382
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:18,948
Not the sort of conquests
you would ever understand.

383
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:20,941
Let's see.

384
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:24,949
A touch of unhappy childhood.

385
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,491
A dash of teenage rebellion.

386
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:38,064
And last, but not least...

387
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:40,366
a tragic death in the family.

388
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:41,393
Doctor.

389
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:44,632
Mr. Book.

390
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:53,845
Why does Murdoch not sleep...

391
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:55,785
during the tuning as the others do?

392
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,950
I don't know. Maybe he's a step up
the evolutionary ladder.

393
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,858
A freak of nature.
He's adapting to survive.

394
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:06,295
What do you expect?
Weren't you looking for the human soul?

395
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,890
That's the purpose
of your little zoo, isn't it?

396
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:12,266
That's why you keep changing people
and things around every night.

397
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:15,397
Maybe you have finally found
what you are looking for...

398
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:16,633
and it's going
to bite you on your--

399
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:24,240
It requires several of your lifetimes
to master our gifts.

400
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:28,150
The idea that a simple man
could develop the ability to tune--

401
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,710
Is absurd, I know...

402
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:31,813
but what other
explanation is there?

403
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:38,618
It is time.

404
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:25,139
Shut it down.

405
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:42,156
Get your paper right here!

406
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:55,400
It's driving me crazy.

407
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,872
I can't sleep.

408
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:58,704
And they call my job "unskilled".

409
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:00,040
You think you've got it tough?

410
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:01,942
You try looking after these kids,
for a change.

411
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:06,977
Anyways, Frederickson says
he'll take me off the damn night shift soon.

412
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:09,418
Well, it's about time, dear.

413
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,185
Hello?

414
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,159
Hello?!

415
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:35,804
Wake up!

416
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:36,862
Hey!

417
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:40,608
Wake up!

418
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:42,544
Wake up!

419
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,115
Wake up!

420
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:49,247
Hello?!

421
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:52,680
Can anybody hear me?!

422
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,218
Let the tuning commence.

423
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:41,848
The Goodwins.
Jeremy, Sylvia...

424
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:44,190
Jane and little Matthew.

425
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:50,057
Jane and little Matthew.

426
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:22,859
The rich get richer.

427
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:26,563
Probably have maid's quarters
before the night is through.

428
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:21,554
Dr. Schreber, I presume.

429
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:23,081
It's you.

430
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:24,526
Hey, come on.

431
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:26,756
That's no way to greet
a patient, Doctor.

432
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:28,560
If that's what you are,
huh, Doctor?

433
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:29,998
Mr. Murdoch, please, l--

434
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:31,899
What is happening here?
Why is everyone asleep?

435
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:34,301
Shh. Please keep your voice down.

436
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,272
Why can't I remember anything?
What have you done to me?

437
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:39,070
Nothing, nothing.
Please, I want to help you.

438
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:40,406
We can't talk here.

439
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:42,639
It is not safe.
If they see us together, they'll--

440
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,113
I don't care.
I want some answers.

441
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:45,479
I want some answers now!

442
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:46,676
Who are they?

443
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:48,651
Why are they trying to kill me?

444
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:49,846
Answer me!

445
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:58,255
My God. You really can do it.

446
00:44:58,295 --> 00:44:59,592
I did that?

447
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,860
Listen to me, John.
You have their power.

448
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:03,992
You can make things happen
by will alone.

449
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:07,333
They call it tuning. That is how they make
the buildings change.

450
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,931
Just now you acted out
of self-defense. A reflex.

451
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:12,806
But I can teach you to control
your power consciously.

452
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:15,175
Let me help you, John.
Together we can stop them.

453
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:16,839
We can take the city back.

454
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:20,846
My glasses.

455
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,254
My glasses, please.

456
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:15,031
He made a terrible
impression for the firm...

457
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:17,404
Iollygagging around as he did.

458
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:20,342
So I simply told Frederickson
I was going to have to let him go.

459
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:23,073
And well you should have, darling.

460
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:24,778
He attacked me.

461
00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:26,977
I don't know where he has gone.

462
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:29,950
Come, Dr. Schreber.

463
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:32,580
We have much to do.

464
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,386
Yes?

465
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:36,119
Yes.

466
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:58,708
# They say that you're
a run-around lover #

467
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:02,651
# Though you say #

468
00:47:02,686 --> 00:47:06,588
# It isn't so #

469
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:15,528
# But if you put me down
for another #

470
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:20,098
# I'll know #

471
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:24,574
# Believe me, I'll know #

472
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:30,144
# 'Cause the night #

473
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:34,116
# Has a thousand eyes #

474
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:38,954
# And a thousand eyes #

475
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:42,254
# Can't tell, but see #

476
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:51,192
# If you are true to me #

477
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:56,964
# So remember #

478
00:47:57,007 --> 00:48:02,707
# When you tell those little white lies #

479
00:48:02,746 --> 00:48:13,179
# That the night
has a thousand eyes #

480
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:20,627
# A thousand eyes #

481
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:30,831
Tonight's experiment shall be conducted
in the following locations.

482
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:35,277
The first subject
shall be imprinted here on Avenue M.

483
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:37,837
Mr. Book. There is a problem.

484
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:41,214
There is no Avenue M.
We were unable to complete it.

485
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:44,982
During the last tuning
we detected a lack of control.

486
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:47,684
An opposing influence
on the machines?

487
00:48:47,724 --> 00:48:52,457
Then this man Murdoch
is more powerful than we thought.

488
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:54,259
He's becoming like us.

489
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:58,860
So we must become like him.

490
00:48:58,902 --> 00:49:01,336
The good doctor
has done as we asked?

491
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:04,636
The life and times
of John Murdoch, Volume 2.

492
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:09,342
We must not do this.

493
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:12,906
Murdoch does not possess
these memories, yes?

494
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,612
How will his imprint
allow us to find him?

495
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:17,984
Everywhere he goes...

496
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:20,649
everyone he seeks out
will be known to us.

497
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:25,685
And as he follows the clues,
so shall we follow the memories.

498
00:49:25,729 --> 00:49:28,391
Perhaps we have forgotten
what happened last time, when we t--

499
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:31,560
Yes. Poor, poor Mr.--

500
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:33,466
We have not forgotten.

501
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:40,773
If Mr. Hand wishes to make this sacrifice
for the greater good...

502
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:42,845
so be it.

503
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:48,078
But to imprint one of us.
Failure has always resulted.

504
00:49:48,118 --> 00:49:51,645
What Mr. Hand proposes
is our only option.

505
00:49:51,688 --> 00:49:53,121
Imprint.

506
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:00,558
This may sting a bit.

507
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:39,301
Is it done?

508
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:42,562
Oh, yes, Mr. Book.

509
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:47,034
I have John Murdoch...in mind.

510
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:53,009
"Johnny...

511
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:57,208
"l found this postcard
among your mother's things.

512
00:50:57,254 --> 00:50:59,381
"Brings back memories,
doesn't it?

513
00:50:59,423 --> 00:51:01,288
"Stop by sometime.

514
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:03,121
"We'll see if we
can't hook ourselves...

515
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,491
"another mermaid.

516
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:06,496
"Love to Emma. Karl."

517
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:13,927
Karl.

518
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:16,934
Karl Harris.

519
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,613
Harris.

520
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:28,551
Harris.

521
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:32,687
"Harris Karl."

522
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:37,491
Excuse me. Can you tell
me the way to Avenue C?

523
00:51:37,527 --> 00:51:38,721
Try the subway.

524
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:44,290
You got a problem, pal?

525
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:47,269
You been working here long?

526
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:51,637
25 years. No days off
for good behavior.

527
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:19,929
We're looking for John Murdoch.

528
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:55,997
She knows nothing, Mr. Hand.

529
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:58,166
A dead end, yes, Mr. Wall.

530
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:00,802
We thought his imprint would
allow us to track him, yes...

531
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:03,278
but instead we have
been brought here.

532
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:04,940
This is irrational.

533
00:53:04,981 --> 00:53:07,313
Instincts are irrational, Mr. Wall...

534
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:10,786
and we must follow
where they lead, yes.

535
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:15,314
Mr. Sleep suggests he may go
to places familiar...his job.

536
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:17,417
He does not care about our job.

537
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:20,293
Indulge us, Mr. Hand.

538
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:21,957
If you were Murdoch--

539
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:22,987
Yes.

540
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,967
If...

541
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:26,559
I were Murdoch...

542
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:30,105
I would remember...

543
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:33,701
how my wife had hurt me
by sleeping with another man.

544
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:36,745
And then...

545
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:41,973
I would look for a way
to hurt her in return.

546
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:48,021
Leave me alone with her.

547
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:49,821
There's work to be done.

548
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:55,628
All change, platform 3.

549
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:58,498
Platform 3, all change.

550
00:53:58,535 --> 00:54:00,230
All change? Excuse me.

551
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:01,601
How do I get to the end of the line?

552
00:54:01,638 --> 00:54:03,196
You want the Express.

553
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:14,212
No trains leave on platform 7.

554
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:15,650
- You want platform 2.
- Got it. Thanks a lot.

555
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:16,674
Hey!

556
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,187
How come that train didn't stop?

557
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:19,711
That's the Express.

558
00:54:21,057 --> 00:54:22,991
There's no way out, you know?

559
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:25,927
You can't get out of the city.
Believe me, I've tried.

560
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:28,658
You're Murdoch, aren't you?

561
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:30,895
The one they've been looking for.

562
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,765
- Who are you?
- Used to be a cop.

563
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,938
At least, in this life, I was.

564
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:38,432
They steal people's
memories, you know?

565
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:40,806
Then they swap them around
between us.

566
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:43,540
I've seen them do it.
Back and forth, back and forth...

567
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,673
till no one knows
who they are anymore.

568
00:54:45,715 --> 00:54:46,977
How do you know all this?

569
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:51,351
Once in a while, one of us wakes up
while they're changing things.

570
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:53,618
It's not supposed to happen,
but it does.

571
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:55,682
It happened to me.

572
00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:57,625
They'll come looking for you, Murdoch.

573
00:54:58,762 --> 00:55:00,389
Just like they'll come looking for me.

574
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:02,528
But that's OK.

575
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:04,032
I figured a way out.

576
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:16,776
They were here.

577
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:19,945
Last night.

578
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:22,281
This was to be his home.

579
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:26,886
That was when we loved her.

580
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:28,788
This is all well and good, Mr. Hand...

581
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:33,319
But we require a more practical link
to his present whereabouts.

582
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,227
Yes.

583
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,833
And I know where to find her.

584
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:51,613
We're very lucky,
when you think about it.

585
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:52,637
I'm sorry?

586
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:56,948
To be able to revisit those places
which have meant so very much to us.

587
00:55:57,754 --> 00:55:59,847
I thought it was more
that we were haunted by them.

588
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:01,880
Perhaps.

589
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:05,620
But imagine a life...

590
00:56:05,662 --> 00:56:08,290
alien to yours...

591
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:10,026
in which your memories
were not your own...

592
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:13,627
but those shared
by every other of your kind.

593
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:18,671
Imagine the torment
of such an existence...

594
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:21,176
no experiences to call your own.

595
00:56:23,813 --> 00:56:26,043
If it was all you knew...

596
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:27,811
maybe it would be a comfort.

597
00:56:28,485 --> 00:56:31,181
But if you were to discover
something different...

598
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:34,788
Something...better.

599
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:41,523
There used to be a ferry
when I was a boy.

600
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:43,327
Biggest thing you ever saw.

601
00:56:43,366 --> 00:56:46,494
Lit up like a floating birthday cake.

602
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:50,001
That's just what my husband
once said to me...

603
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:51,870
on this very spot.

604
00:56:53,209 --> 00:56:55,074
Where is your husband now?

605
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:58,603
I wish I knew.
What brings you here?

606
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:02,317
I met my wife at this place.

607
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:04,149
It's where I first met my husband.

608
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:06,417
Small world.

609
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:30,606
No, no, no.

610
00:58:00,343 --> 00:58:01,776
Hello?

611
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:03,639
Hello?

612
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:50,189
What are you doing here?

613
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:52,126
I've been following you.

614
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:57,830
Hold it right there!

615
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:01,302
Johnny?

616
00:59:01,738 --> 00:59:03,501
Johnny!

617
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,802
It's been so damn long...

618
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:07,674
I thought you'd forgotten
your Uncle Karl.

619
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:10,241
You son of a gun!

620
00:59:13,316 --> 00:59:14,783
Uncle Karl?

621
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:19,414
Wait.

622
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,082
Is that me?

623
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:24,320
Yeah.

624
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:35,394
Shell Beach is where I grew up?

625
00:59:35,438 --> 00:59:36,598
That's what I said.

626
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:39,005
Shell Beach, your hometown.

627
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:42,239
I need to get there, Karl.
How do I get there?

628
00:59:42,278 --> 00:59:43,905
I don't know.

629
00:59:43,947 --> 00:59:47,007
- I haven't been there in years.
- Come on. You must remember.

630
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:49,075
You gotta have some idea.

631
00:59:49,118 --> 00:59:50,016
Come on!

632
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:51,915
Sorry, Johnny.

633
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:56,290
The old cracker barrel
ain't what it used to be.

634
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:01,489
So bright there.

635
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:03,795
Brighter times, I guess.

636
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:07,901
You were always scribbling
in that damn book.

637
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:11,066
That's me and your pa.

638
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:13,268
What a couple of handsome fools.

639
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:15,604
What happened to my parents?

640
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:21,744
Where are they now?

641
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:24,710
They're dead, Johnny.

642
01:00:24,754 --> 01:00:27,188
They died when their house
burnt down.

643
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:28,884
I looked after you.

644
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:31,793
You don't remember that, really?

645
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:36,463
What's that?

646
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,900
What is that?

647
01:00:43,606 --> 01:00:45,301
It's a scar.

648
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:47,935
You burnt your arm
pretty bad in the fire.

649
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:56,782
- What does it mean, Johnny?
- It means these are all lies!

650
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:02,658
Why are you here, Mrs. Murdoch?

651
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:14,269
My husband told me
he'd been here.

652
01:01:18,107 --> 01:01:20,371
He told me he wanted
to test himself...

653
01:01:21,577 --> 01:01:23,943
see if he was...

654
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:25,948
capable of--

655
01:01:35,158 --> 01:01:38,958
I wanted to talk to her. I thought maybe
she could help me find him.

656
01:01:40,163 --> 01:01:42,597
Stay here.
I'm gonna call the station.

657
01:01:53,943 --> 01:01:59,074
Yeah, this is Bumstead. Send the
homicide coroner to 1440--East, yeah.

658
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:02,179
There's been another one.

659
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:05,415
It's the same pattern.
I'll explain when you get here.

660
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:17,426
Oh, God.

661
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:19,662
It's OK. I won't hurt you.

662
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:21,593
It's OK.

663
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:33,682
Where the hell did she come from?

664
01:02:33,716 --> 01:02:35,206
I found her hiding.

665
01:02:35,952 --> 01:02:37,783
She saw what happened here.

666
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:07,907
Are you ready to go home,
Mrs. Murdoch?

667
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:10,612
The inspector is gonna take me. Thanks.

668
01:03:35,511 --> 01:03:36,773
It's beautiful.

669
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:42,647
It was a gift from my mother.

670
01:03:42,685 --> 01:03:45,210
She died recently.

671
01:03:45,254 --> 01:03:47,552
I keep it with me
to remind me of her.

672
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:50,857
I'm sorry.

673
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:56,458
It's a funny thing, though.

674
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:58,865
I can't remember
when she gave it to me.

675
01:04:01,437 --> 01:04:04,429
How do you think I could
forget a thing like that?

676
01:04:06,609 --> 01:04:10,773
Do you think about the past much,
Mrs. Murdoch?

677
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:15,713
What's happening, lnspector?

678
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:18,447
I'm not sure I know anymore.

679
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:24,516
I left your old room like it was.

680
01:04:24,594 --> 01:04:26,687
You can sleep here tonight, huh?

681
01:04:26,762 --> 01:04:29,060
Glad to have you back, Johnny...

682
01:04:29,098 --> 01:04:30,793
even if it is for just a night.

683
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:31,822
Karl.

684
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:34,197
Is that the right time?

685
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:38,139
Why, sure. That clock's
kept perfect time since I bought it.

686
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:39,971
A.m. or p.m.?

687
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:42,577
What do you think, Johnny?

688
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:44,603
I don't understand.
How can it be night already?

689
01:04:44,647 --> 01:04:46,342
What happened to the day?
How'd I miss it?

690
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:49,249
You're tired. Anything's possible.

691
01:04:49,285 --> 01:04:50,684
Look...

692
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:54,281
get some sleep. We'll straighten
all this out tomorrow.

693
01:05:20,149 --> 01:05:23,050
"Guide to Shell Beach
by Johnny Murdoch. "

694
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:27,853
Oh, come on.

695
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:48,843
- Hello?
- Emma, he's here.

696
01:05:48,878 --> 01:05:51,005
He's acting mighty peculiar.

697
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:53,106
I know. He's not himself.

698
01:05:53,149 --> 01:05:55,083
Keep him there,
and I'll be right over.

699
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:57,449
- I'll try.
- Thanks, Karl. Bye.

700
01:05:59,989 --> 01:06:01,081
Johnny.

701
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:02,988
I can't promise anything,
Mrs. Murdoch.

702
01:06:03,025 --> 01:06:04,583
We just have to play it as it comes.

703
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:08,119
Johnny, we just wanted to help.

704
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:16,905
Karl.

705
01:06:16,939 --> 01:06:18,338
Uncle Karl.

706
01:06:18,374 --> 01:06:22,071
Johnny, if you're in some kind of trouble...
well, maybe we could do something.

707
01:06:23,546 --> 01:06:26,014
Haven't seen you in so long.

708
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:27,940
Yes.

709
01:07:40,589 --> 01:07:45,993
Mr. Murdoch...you've been
the cause of much distress.

710
01:07:50,032 --> 01:07:52,466
- Start talking.
- There's no need for this.

711
01:07:52,501 --> 01:07:53,866
There's no escape.

712
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,894
The city's ours. We made it.

713
01:07:55,938 --> 01:07:57,428
What are you talking about?

714
01:07:57,473 --> 01:08:00,670
We fashioned this city
on stolen memories...

715
01:08:00,709 --> 01:08:04,543
different eras, different pasts
all rolled into one.

716
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:07,071
Each night, we revise it, refine it...

717
01:08:07,116 --> 01:08:08,606
in order to learn.

718
01:08:08,651 --> 01:08:10,050
Learn what?

719
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,553
About you, Mr. Murdoch...

720
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:13,851
you and your fellow inhabitants...

721
01:08:13,889 --> 01:08:15,686
what makes you human.

722
01:08:16,225 --> 01:08:19,251
- Why?!
- We need to be like you.

723
01:08:20,229 --> 01:08:22,595
I understand you now, Mr. Murdoch.

724
01:08:22,631 --> 01:08:26,192
I remember that which you do not...
what you've been missing.

725
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:27,896
The ocean, yes...

726
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:31,566
running along the waves as a child...

727
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:36,544
meeting Emma at the river...
That first kiss that followed.

728
01:08:37,146 --> 01:08:38,306
What are you?

729
01:08:38,347 --> 01:08:40,110
You've seen what we are.

730
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:43,084
We use your dead as vessels.

731
01:10:52,781 --> 01:10:53,770
Get in!

732
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:11,756
What about her? Ring any bells?

733
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,131
She was alive when I left her.

734
01:11:13,168 --> 01:11:14,260
What about this?

735
01:11:14,303 --> 01:11:16,328
This is nothing. This is--

736
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:18,670
It must mean something,
all those pictures.

737
01:11:18,707 --> 01:11:19,867
What pictures?

738
01:11:20,876 --> 01:11:21,900
I don't understand this.

739
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:24,777
Stop playing games with me, Murdoch!
Stop telling me lies!

740
01:11:24,813 --> 01:11:26,303
I am not telling you lies!

741
01:11:26,348 --> 01:11:28,748
Help me out here.
Make me understand.

742
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:30,877
I have this jigsaw puzzle
in front of my face...

743
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:33,911
and every time I try to rearrange
the pieces, it still doesn't make any sense.

744
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:35,321
You think it makes sense to me?

745
01:11:35,357 --> 01:11:37,416
I'm as much in the dark here
as you are.

746
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:39,620
You let me ask you a question?

747
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:42,128
You heard of a place
called Shell Beach?

748
01:11:42,164 --> 01:11:44,655
- Sure.
- You know how to get there?

749
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,133
- Yeah.
- You tell me?

750
01:11:46,168 --> 01:11:50,298
All right. You just--
You go to the...

751
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:52,264
Where? Where do you go?

752
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:54,401
Just give me a second, will ya?

753
01:11:56,578 --> 01:11:58,239
You can't remember, can you?

754
01:12:00,549 --> 01:12:01,982
You think that's kind of odd?

755
01:12:04,019 --> 01:12:05,008
Wait.

756
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:06,453
I got a better one for you.

757
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:07,785
When was the last time...

758
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:10,690
you remember doing
something during the day?

759
01:12:10,726 --> 01:12:11,818
What do you mean?

760
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:14,124
I just mean...during the day.

761
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:16,190
Daylight.

762
01:12:16,231 --> 01:12:17,789
When was the last time
you remember seeing it?

763
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:21,599
And I'm not talking about some distant,
half-forgotten childhood memory.

764
01:12:21,637 --> 01:12:24,765
I mean like yesterday?
Last week? When?

765
01:12:24,807 --> 01:12:27,207
Can you come up
with a single memory?

766
01:12:28,744 --> 01:12:30,006
You can't, can you?

767
01:12:30,045 --> 01:12:33,310
You know something?
I don't think the sun even...

768
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:36,045
exists...in this place.

769
01:12:36,085 --> 01:12:40,317
'Cause I've been up for hours and hours
and hours and the night never ends here.

770
01:12:41,123 --> 01:12:43,751
- That is crazy.
- You're damn right this is crazy.

771
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:46,158
Listen to me, Bumstead.
It's not just me.

772
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:48,220
It's all of us.

773
01:12:48,263 --> 01:12:49,821
They're doing something to all of us.

774
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:52,629
- Shut up, I've heard enough.
- Please listen.

775
01:12:52,668 --> 01:12:54,397
- Shut up, will ya! Shut up!
- Listen to me.

776
01:13:04,646 --> 01:13:07,911
There has to be an explanation
for this somewhere.

777
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:17,389
Explain this.

778
01:13:38,013 --> 01:13:40,208
John, I'm so sorry.

779
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:43,014
I never meant to hurt you, John...

780
01:13:43,051 --> 01:13:44,177
and I did it,
and I don't know why I did.

781
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:46,380
I wish I could take it all back.

782
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:48,947
No. Emma... You didn't do it.

783
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:51,755
This...affair of yours,
whatever it is...

784
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:53,421
the thing you're
supposed to have done...

785
01:13:53,462 --> 01:13:55,327
you didn't do it.
I don't believe it ever happened.

786
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:56,763
What do you mean?

787
01:13:56,799 --> 01:13:59,165
I know this is gonna sound crazy...

788
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:02,102
but what if we never
knew each other before now?

789
01:14:02,137 --> 01:14:04,571
What if the first time we ever met...

790
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:08,440
was last night in your--
in our apartment...

791
01:14:08,477 --> 01:14:11,412
and everything you remember...

792
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:14,280
and everything that I'm supposed
to remember never really happened?

793
01:14:14,316 --> 01:14:16,910
Someone just wants us to think it did.

794
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:24,456
You know, back in the apartment...

795
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:27,694
I suddenly felt like
I didn't know you at all.

796
01:14:29,498 --> 01:14:31,989
It was as if you were a stranger.

797
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:35,998
But how can that be true?

798
01:14:36,605 --> 01:14:40,735
I so vividly remember meeting you.

799
01:14:40,776 --> 01:14:43,802
I remember falling in love with you.

800
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:46,443
I remember losing you.

801
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:47,839
Time's up.

802
01:14:49,184 --> 01:14:50,674
No, wait, wait.

803
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:52,846
Please, just...

804
01:14:52,888 --> 01:14:53,980
just one more minute.

805
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,623
I love you, John.

806
01:15:05,467 --> 01:15:08,163
You can't fake something like that.

807
01:15:09,137 --> 01:15:10,468
No, you can't.

808
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:42,562
Inspector? Sir?

809
01:15:43,972 --> 01:15:46,532
Detective Walenski
killed himself last night.

810
01:15:46,575 --> 01:15:50,341
I...kind of thought
you should know.

811
01:15:52,981 --> 01:15:55,643
Oh, and...
the chief wanted to see you.

812
01:15:56,818 --> 01:15:57,978
Sir...

813
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:06,050
I knew you'd track the killer down, sir.

814
01:16:18,774 --> 01:16:19,763
Sir...

815
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:22,734
shoelace.

816
01:16:35,991 --> 01:16:37,151
How can we help you, sir?

817
01:16:37,192 --> 01:16:39,558
You can sleep.

818
01:16:41,697 --> 01:16:42,686
Gentlemen--

819
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:44,289
Sleep. Sleep.

820
01:16:47,936 --> 01:16:49,198
Evening, sir.

821
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,138
Bumstead.

822
01:17:01,984 --> 01:17:05,579
I wanted to be the first
to congratulate you...about the case.

823
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:11,088
Take us to Murdoch.

824
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:12,218
Sleep.

825
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:41,220
Dr. Schreber.

826
01:17:42,391 --> 01:17:44,154
I knew you'd come eventually.

827
01:17:44,192 --> 01:17:46,888
Don't you think it's about time
you started giving me some answers?

828
01:17:46,928 --> 01:17:49,123
Yes. Yes, of course.

829
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:50,893
Won't you please sit down?

830
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:56,027
I come here quite often.

831
01:17:56,071 --> 01:17:58,539
It's one of the few places
I'm allowed a moment's peace.

832
01:17:58,573 --> 01:18:01,940
You see,
they have an aversion to water.

833
01:18:03,111 --> 01:18:05,045
One could almost call it a phobia.

834
01:18:05,614 --> 01:18:08,879
Who are they?
What do they want from me?

835
01:18:08,917 --> 01:18:10,475
Right.

836
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:12,578
Well, for now, let's just say...

837
01:18:12,621 --> 01:18:15,317
that you were the subject
of their experiment.

838
01:18:15,357 --> 01:18:16,722
We all are.

839
01:18:19,027 --> 01:18:20,961
You're not crazy, John.

840
01:18:21,730 --> 01:18:23,459
And you are not a murderer.

841
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:27,163
I'm sorry about this. I truly am.

842
01:18:27,202 --> 01:18:28,726
But we do not have much time...

843
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:31,398
and I cannot afford the luxury
of doing this the right way.

844
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:32,964
Everything you need to know...

845
01:18:33,008 --> 01:18:35,340
all the answers
are in this syringe.

846
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:36,571
I need you to inject yourself.

847
01:18:36,611 --> 01:18:39,011
It's the only way to
make you understand.

848
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:40,344
You're kidding me, right?

849
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:43,351
We're running out of time, John.
You have to do this now.

850
01:18:43,952 --> 01:18:45,419
Give me the gun, Doctor.

851
01:18:45,454 --> 01:18:47,888
Inspector, he is more
disturbed than we thought.

852
01:18:47,923 --> 01:18:50,653
I may not be the judge of personality
that you are, Doctor...

853
01:18:50,692 --> 01:18:53,661
but you're the one
who looks disturbed to me.

854
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:56,360
You do not know
what you are doing.

855
01:18:57,566 --> 01:19:01,161
What, exactly is in this...Doctor?

856
01:19:02,904 --> 01:19:05,099
All the answers you've
been looking for, John.

857
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:06,232
I swear to you.

858
01:19:07,776 --> 01:19:12,839
Guess I'll just have to
hold on to it for...safekeeping.

859
01:19:12,881 --> 01:19:14,075
If you don't mind.

860
01:19:14,116 --> 01:19:15,481
Let's go, Doctor.

861
01:19:16,818 --> 01:19:22,188
- Go? Where are we going?
- Shell Beach.

862
01:19:23,225 --> 01:19:25,591
That's where you want to go, isn't it?

863
01:19:25,627 --> 01:19:27,219
The ocean.

864
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:37,761
Why are you doing this?

865
01:19:39,474 --> 01:19:41,101
What do you hope to gain by helping me?

866
01:19:41,143 --> 01:19:42,701
The truth.

867
01:19:43,478 --> 01:19:46,447
None of these maps extend far enough
to show the ocean.

868
01:19:46,481 --> 01:19:47,880
You won't find anything there...

869
01:19:47,916 --> 01:19:49,850
I promise you!
I've been there, and--

870
01:19:49,885 --> 01:19:52,410
If you've been there,
you can show us the way, then, can't you?

871
01:19:53,555 --> 01:19:55,113
We'll see for ourselves.

872
01:19:56,191 --> 01:19:57,215
I won't.

873
01:19:58,393 --> 01:20:01,123
I refuse.
You can't make me go there!

874
01:20:13,375 --> 01:20:15,536
You were saying, doctor?

875
01:20:27,289 --> 01:20:30,816
I don't understand.
Used to be a bridge here.

876
01:20:37,566 --> 01:20:39,158
Try that again,
your friends are gonna be...

877
01:20:39,201 --> 01:20:40,532
fishing you out of the canal.

878
01:20:40,569 --> 01:20:41,968
Just don't hurt me.
I'll tell you everything.

879
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:44,028
It doesn't matter anymore anyway.

880
01:20:50,979 --> 01:20:52,139
What?

881
01:20:54,883 --> 01:20:57,181
Who are you people?

882
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:05,850
We will give you some more
pretty things soon...Anna.

883
01:21:06,328 --> 01:21:07,522
I'm not Anna.

884
01:21:09,397 --> 01:21:11,297
You will be soon, yes.

885
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:18,237
I have another use for her first.

886
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:30,179
First there was darkness.
Then came the strangers.

887
01:21:32,354 --> 01:21:34,652
They abducted us
and brought us here.

888
01:21:35,924 --> 01:21:38,688
This city, everyone in it...

889
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:40,092
is their experiment.

890
01:21:40,128 --> 01:21:43,029
They mix and match
our memories as they see fit...

891
01:21:43,064 --> 01:21:45,828
trying to divine
what makes us unique.

892
01:21:46,534 --> 01:21:49,298
One day, a man
might be an inspector.

893
01:21:49,337 --> 01:21:52,238
The next, someone entirely different.

894
01:21:52,274 --> 01:21:55,573
When they want to
study a murderer for instance...

895
01:21:55,610 --> 01:21:59,444
they simply imprint one of their citizens
with a new personality...

896
01:22:00,548 --> 01:22:04,575
arrange a family for him,
friends, an entire history...

897
01:22:05,387 --> 01:22:06,411
even a lost wallet.

898
01:22:07,022 --> 01:22:08,683
Then they observe the results.

899
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:14,221
Will a man, given the history
of a killer, continue in that vein?

900
01:22:14,262 --> 01:22:18,255
Or are we, in fact, more
than the mere sum of our memories?

901
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:23,294
This business of you being a killer
was an unhappy coincidence.

902
01:22:23,338 --> 01:22:26,205
You have had dozens
of lives before now.

903
01:22:26,241 --> 01:22:29,574
You just happened to wake up
while I was imprinting you with this one.

904
01:22:30,345 --> 01:22:32,472
Why are they doing all of this?

905
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:35,915
It is our capacity for individuality...

906
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:38,511
our souls that makes
us different from them.

907
01:22:38,553 --> 01:22:40,919
They think they
can find the human soul...

908
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:44,084
if they understand
how our memories work.

909
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:45,387
All they have
are collective memories.

910
01:22:45,427 --> 01:22:48,260
They share one group mind.

911
01:22:48,296 --> 01:22:49,763
They're dying, you see?

912
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:53,234
Their entire race
is on the brink of extinction.

913
01:22:53,268 --> 01:22:55,133
They think we can save them.

914
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:57,604
- Where do I fit in?
- You are different, John.

915
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:01,072
You resisted my attempt
to imprint you.

916
01:23:05,714 --> 01:23:09,115
Somehow you have developed
their ability to tune.

917
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:10,447
That is how they change things.

918
01:23:10,485 --> 01:23:12,009
That is how they built this city.

919
01:23:12,053 --> 01:23:14,954
They have machines buried deep
beneath the surface...

920
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:18,926
that allow them
to focus their telepathic energies.

921
01:23:19,794 --> 01:23:22,285
They control everything here,
even the sun.

922
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:25,663
That's why it's always dark.
They can't stand the light.

923
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:26,962
So why do they need you?

924
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:31,405
When they first brought us here,
they extracted what was in us.

925
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:35,273
So they could store the information,
remix it like so much paint...

926
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:37,835
and give us back new memories
of their choosing.

927
01:23:37,879 --> 01:23:41,508
But they still needed an artist
to help them.

928
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:46,514
I understood the intricacies
of the human mind...

929
01:23:46,554 --> 01:23:49,079
better than they ever could...

930
01:23:49,124 --> 01:23:51,854
so they allowed me
to keep my skills as a scientist...

931
01:23:51,893 --> 01:23:53,326
because they needed them.

932
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:55,829
But they made me
delete everything else.

933
01:24:04,205 --> 01:24:07,038
Can you imagine what
it is like being forced...

934
01:24:07,075 --> 01:24:08,804
to erase your own past?

935
01:24:08,843 --> 01:24:12,176
What about my past?
What about my childhood?

936
01:24:13,081 --> 01:24:15,777
Shell Beach, Uncle Karl.

937
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:17,848
What about this?

938
01:24:18,753 --> 01:24:20,653
This was blank when I found it!

939
01:24:20,688 --> 01:24:22,713
You still don't understand, John.

940
01:24:22,757 --> 01:24:25,954
You were never a boy...
not in this place.

941
01:24:25,994 --> 01:24:28,792
Your entire history is an illusion,
a fabrication...

942
01:24:28,830 --> 01:24:30,695
as it is with all of us.

943
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:33,223
You made those drawings
happen with your gift.

944
01:24:33,268 --> 01:24:35,133
You say they brought us here.

945
01:24:36,938 --> 01:24:38,098
From where?

946
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:42,934
I'm sorry.

947
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:45,842
I don't remember.

948
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:47,609
None of us remember that...

949
01:24:48,316 --> 01:24:49,908
what we once were...

950
01:24:49,951 --> 01:24:52,385
what we might have been...

951
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:53,785
somewhere else.

952
01:25:11,272 --> 01:25:13,240
I've taken you this far.

953
01:25:13,274 --> 01:25:15,401
You don't need me anymore.

954
01:25:15,443 --> 01:25:17,240
Let's go.

955
01:25:35,463 --> 01:25:37,260
John.

956
01:26:01,356 --> 01:26:04,154
There is no ocean, John.

957
01:26:04,192 --> 01:26:08,322
There is nothing beyond the city.

958
01:26:08,363 --> 01:26:11,696
The only place home exists...

959
01:26:13,535 --> 01:26:15,526
is in your head.

960
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:25,608
No! No!

961
01:26:25,647 --> 01:26:27,478
John, stop!

962
01:26:30,051 --> 01:26:31,177
No!

963
01:26:33,888 --> 01:26:35,185
Stop!

964
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:42,056
Please!

965
01:26:42,897 --> 01:26:44,091
No!

966
01:27:02,584 --> 01:27:04,745
And now you know the truth.

967
01:27:24,105 --> 01:27:25,367
No!

968
01:28:13,388 --> 01:28:16,289
You'll allow yourself
to surrender, Mr. Murdoch...

969
01:28:16,324 --> 01:28:18,554
or it will result in
this one's death, yes?

970
01:28:18,593 --> 01:28:21,118
What do I care?
She's not my real wife!

971
01:28:21,162 --> 01:28:22,288
She's nothing to me!

972
01:28:22,330 --> 01:28:26,562
But you do still care,
don't you, Mr. Murdoch?

973
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:29,263
You see, I have
become the monster...

974
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:31,295
you were intended to be.

975
01:28:33,107 --> 01:28:37,009
Shall I end her life now
as you would have?

976
01:28:40,048 --> 01:28:42,278
Don't hurt her, please!

977
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:46,947
Then surrender, Mr. Murdoch.

978
01:28:46,988 --> 01:28:48,615
Sleep.

979
01:28:50,458 --> 01:28:52,653
Now.

980
01:28:54,529 --> 01:28:56,156
John?

981
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:12,339
Sleep.

982
01:29:34,235 --> 01:29:37,068
The doctor was right.
He has evolved.

983
01:29:37,438 --> 01:29:38,962
Kill him.

984
01:29:39,006 --> 01:29:40,667
Kill him!
Kill him!

985
01:29:44,779 --> 01:29:47,509
Kill him! Kill him!

986
01:29:50,184 --> 01:29:52,709
He is powerful, yes.

987
01:29:52,754 --> 01:29:57,214
Dangerous. But he can also
lead us to what we seek.

988
01:29:57,258 --> 01:30:00,659
What the doctor calls the soul.

989
01:30:00,695 --> 01:30:04,392
It is time for our experiment
to move into a final phase.

990
01:30:04,432 --> 01:30:07,162
We no longer need
the other subjects.

991
01:30:07,201 --> 01:30:10,830
The time for study is over.

992
01:30:10,872 --> 01:30:15,070
It is time to be one
with John Murdoch.

993
01:30:21,749 --> 01:30:23,580
It is time, Doctor.

994
01:30:23,618 --> 01:30:25,176
Imprint.

995
01:30:27,955 --> 01:30:30,719
Shut it down!

996
01:30:30,758 --> 01:30:33,921
Shut it down forever!

997
01:30:47,809 --> 01:30:50,073
What are you doing?

998
01:30:50,111 --> 01:30:54,639
They want to imprint you
with their own collective memories.

999
01:30:55,983 --> 01:31:00,113
They want to make you one of them,
so they can share your soul.

1000
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:08,592
Imprint, Doctor.
No more disobedience.

1001
01:31:08,629 --> 01:31:10,460
I'm sorry, John.

1002
01:31:10,498 --> 01:31:13,490
The pain will only last a moment.

1003
01:31:15,636 --> 01:31:16,603
No!

1004
01:31:25,012 --> 01:31:26,309
Remember, John.

1005
01:31:27,582 --> 01:31:29,550
You'll rise to greater
heights than that, my boy.

1006
01:31:29,584 --> 01:31:31,347
One day when you're older,
you'll understand.

1007
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:34,485
Remember.

1008
01:31:35,556 --> 01:31:38,423
That's it, John.
Practice makes perfect.

1009
01:31:38,459 --> 01:31:41,656
Now remember what I told you.
Never talk to strangers.

1010
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:43,493
John, remember.

1011
01:31:43,531 --> 01:31:46,398
You're probably wondering why I keep
appearing in your memories.

1012
01:31:46,434 --> 01:31:48,959
It is because I have
inserted myself in them.

1013
01:31:49,003 --> 01:31:51,096
All of these memories
have been fabricated...

1014
01:31:51,138 --> 01:31:52,833
to teach you about the strangers.

1015
01:31:52,874 --> 01:31:56,002
Give you a lifetime of knowledge
in a single syringe.

1016
01:31:58,846 --> 01:32:01,212
You will survive, John.

1017
01:32:01,249 --> 01:32:03,547
You will find strength
within yourself...

1018
01:32:03,584 --> 01:32:05,552
and you will prevail.

1019
01:32:05,586 --> 01:32:06,951
Remember.

1020
01:32:07,722 --> 01:32:08,711
Hi, Uncle Karl.

1021
01:32:08,756 --> 01:32:09,745
Johnny!

1022
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:14,853
You're getting the hang of it, John.

1023
01:32:14,896 --> 01:32:16,955
Maybe one day
I'll be working for you.

1024
01:32:17,765 --> 01:32:20,996
This is the machine the strangers use
to amplify their thoughts.

1025
01:32:21,035 --> 01:32:22,900
The machine
that changes their world.

1026
01:32:22,937 --> 01:32:24,495
You must take control of it.

1027
01:32:24,539 --> 01:32:26,166
You must make the machine yours.

1028
01:32:26,207 --> 01:32:28,334
I know you can beat them, John.

1029
01:32:28,376 --> 01:32:30,867
But you must concentrate.

1030
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:34,172
Something's wrong.

1031
01:32:42,823 --> 01:32:45,553
There is no time for romance, John.

1032
01:32:45,593 --> 01:32:47,925
The world can be what you make it.

1033
01:32:47,962 --> 01:32:49,987
What have you done?

1034
01:32:50,031 --> 01:32:52,556
You have the power
to make anything happen...

1035
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:54,090
but you must act now!

1036
01:37:38,986 --> 01:37:40,453
I knew you could do it, John.

1037
01:37:40,487 --> 01:37:42,512
You have their power now.

1038
01:37:42,556 --> 01:37:44,421
You control their machines.

1039
01:37:44,458 --> 01:37:45,857
Where's Emma?

1040
01:37:46,594 --> 01:37:49,427
She is not Emma anymore, John.

1041
01:37:49,463 --> 01:37:50,862
She has been reimprinted.

1042
01:37:50,898 --> 01:37:52,593
So give her back her memories.

1043
01:37:52,633 --> 01:37:55,067
I can't. The facility
where the strangers...

1044
01:37:55,102 --> 01:37:58,094
stored the memories
has been destroyed.

1045
01:37:58,138 --> 01:38:00,299
I'm sorry.

1046
01:38:00,341 --> 01:38:03,037
What are you going to do now, John?

1047
01:38:04,745 --> 01:38:08,579
You told me I had
the power, didn't you?

1048
01:38:08,983 --> 01:38:11,474
I can make these machines
do anything I want.

1049
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:15,452
Make this world anything
I want it to be.

1050
01:38:16,490 --> 01:38:19,516
Just so long as I concentrate
hard enough.

1051
01:39:44,378 --> 01:39:45,777
Where are you going?

1052
01:39:48,716 --> 01:39:50,183
Shell Beach.

1053
01:40:31,058 --> 01:40:32,457
- What's the fare?
- Quarter.

1054
01:40:38,699 --> 01:40:39,688
Oh, please.

1055
01:40:39,733 --> 01:40:42,258
- Oh, no--
- It's fine.

1056
01:40:42,302 --> 01:40:43,701
- Thank you.
- OK.

1057
01:41:23,911 --> 01:41:25,776
John...

1058
01:41:29,349 --> 01:41:31,476
Been waiting for you, yes?

1059
01:41:32,219 --> 01:41:33,379
What are you doing?

1060
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:36,787
I'm just making a few little changes
around here, is all.

1061
01:41:36,824 --> 01:41:38,519
Are we sure that's what we want?

1062
01:41:39,026 --> 01:41:41,460
I'm prepared to take my chances.

1063
01:41:41,495 --> 01:41:43,053
I'm dying, John.

1064
01:41:43,097 --> 01:41:45,998
Your imprint is not
agreeable with my kind.

1065
01:41:47,501 --> 01:41:49,765
But I wanted to know
what it was like...

1066
01:41:51,138 --> 01:41:52,605
how you feel.

1067
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:55,335
You know how I was
supposed to feel.

1068
01:41:55,375 --> 01:41:59,175
That person isn't me.
Never was.

1069
01:41:59,213 --> 01:42:02,944
You wanted to know what it was
about us that made us human.

1070
01:42:04,318 --> 01:42:07,651
Well, you're not going
to find it...in here.

1071
01:42:09,423 --> 01:42:12,017
You went looking
in the wrong place.

1072
01:43:50,424 --> 01:43:52,324
It's so beautiful here.

1073
01:43:57,664 --> 01:43:59,131
So bright.

1074
01:44:05,038 --> 01:44:07,871
Do you know if Shell Beach
is around here?

1075
01:44:07,908 --> 01:44:10,536
I think that's it just over there.

1076
01:44:28,695 --> 01:44:30,754
I'm headed that way myself.

1077
01:44:32,699 --> 01:44:34,724
Would you like to join me?

1078
01:44:36,903 --> 01:44:37,892
Sure.

1079
01:44:43,610 --> 01:44:45,942
I'm Anna, by the way.

1080
01:44:45,979 --> 01:44:48,243
- What's your name?
- John.

1081
01:44:50,651 --> 01:44:52,118
John Murdoch.

1082
01:49:40,674 --> 01:49:44,576
# When marimba rhythms
start to play #

1083
01:49:44,611 --> 01:49:47,136
# Dance with me #

1084
01:49:47,180 --> 01:49:49,774
# Make me sway #

1085
01:49:49,816 --> 01:49:54,185
# Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore #

1086
01:49:54,220 --> 01:49:56,279
# Hold me close #

1087
01:49:56,323 --> 01:49:59,315
# Sway me more #

1088
01:49:59,359 --> 01:50:03,489
# Like a flower
bending in the breeze #

1089
01:50:03,530 --> 01:50:05,828
# Bend with me #

1090
01:50:05,865 --> 01:50:08,834
# Sway with ease #

1091
01:50:08,868 --> 01:50:13,168
# When we dance
you have a way with me #

1092
01:50:13,206 --> 01:50:15,197
# Stay with me #

1093
01:50:15,241 --> 01:50:18,108
# Sway with me #

1094
01:50:18,144 --> 01:50:22,911
# Other dancers may be on the floor #

1095
01:50:22,949 --> 01:50:27,648
# Dear, but my eyes will see only you #

1096
01:50:27,687 --> 01:50:32,386
# Only you have that
magic technique #

1097
01:50:32,425 --> 01:50:37,055
# When we sway I go weak #

1098
01:50:37,097 --> 01:50:41,056
# I can hear the sound of violins #

1099
01:50:41,101 --> 01:50:46,368
# Long before it begins #

1100
01:50:46,406 --> 01:50:50,536
# Make me thrill
as only you know how #

1101
01:50:50,577 --> 01:50:56,743
# Sway me smooth, sway me now #

1102
01:50:56,783 --> 01:51:01,846
# Sway me now #

1103
01:51:04,591 --> 01:51:07,958
# Sway me smooth #

1104
01:51:13,566 --> 01:51:19,505
# Sway me now #
