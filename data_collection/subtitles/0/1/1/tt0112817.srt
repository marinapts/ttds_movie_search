My name is Nobody.

- Excuse me?
- My name is Exaybachay:

355

I thought you said
your name was Nobody.

356
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:17,084
I prefer
to be called Nobody.

Um, shouldn't you be
with your own tribe or somethin'?

359

00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:43,047
My mother was

My father is
Abso luka.

362
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:51,751
This mixture
was not respected.

363
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:54,160
As a small boy,

364
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,494
I was often left
to myself.

365
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,797
So I spent many months
stalking the elk people...

366
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:03,395
to prove I would soon
become a good hunter.

367
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:07,375
One day, finally,
my elk relatives took pity on me,

368
00:49:07,477 --> 00:49:09,911
and a young elk
gave his life to me.

369
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:14,379
With only my knife,
I took his life.

370
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:19,547
As I was preparing to cut the meat,
white men came upon me.

371
00:49:19,656 --> 00:49:21,647
They were English soldiers.

372
00:49:21,758 --> 00:49:25,922
I cut one with my knife, but they
hit me on the head with a rifle.

373
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:29,563
All went black.

374
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:31,566
My spirit seemed
to leave me.

375
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:36,668
- [ Neighing ]
- I was then taken east...

376
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:39,742
in a cage.

377
00:49:39,843 --> 00:49:43,176
I was taken to Toronto,
then Philadelphia...

378
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:46,672
and then to New York.

379
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:50,514
And each time I arrived
in another city,

380
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,588
somehow the white men
had moved...

381
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:54,623
all their people there
ahead of me.

382
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:01,162
Each new city contained
the same white people as the last,

383
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:04,290
and I could not understand
how a whole city of people...

384
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:06,301
could be moved
so quickly.

385
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:12,440
Eventually, I was
taken on a ship...

386
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:14,840
across the great sea...

387
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:17,004
over to England,

388
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:19,446
and I was paraded
before them...

389
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:21,676
like a captured animal,

390
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:23,685
an exhibit.

391
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:28,823
And so I mimicked them,
imitating their ways,

392
00:50:28,925 --> 00:50:33,191
hoping that they might lose interest
in this young savage,

393
00:50:33,296 --> 00:50:35,662
but their interest
only grew.

394
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:37,961
So they placed me into
the white man's schools.

395
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:42,232
It was there
that I discovered...

396
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:44,603
in a book...

397
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:47,700
the words that you,
William Blake, had written.

398
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,647
They were powerful words,
and they spoke to me.

399
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:00,556
But I made careful plans,
and I eventually escaped.

400
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:06,252
Once again, I crossed
the great ocean.

401
00:51:07,931 --> 00:51:09,922
I saw many sad things....

402
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:13,662
as I made my way back
to the lands of my people.

403
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:16,705
Once they realized
who I was,

404
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:18,968
the stories of my adventures
angered them.

405
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:22,610
They called me a liar.

406
00:51:22,712 --> 00:51:27,081
"Exaybachay."
He Who Talks Loud, Saying Nothing.

407
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:31,177
They ridiculed me.
My own people.

408
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,554
And I was left to wander
the earth alone.

409
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:40,628
I am Nobody.

[ Twill ] Ain't ya glad the sun
kind of sets? Prepares you like?

I mean, what if it, like, went
out sudden, like, say, blowin'
out a candle or somethin'?

412
00:51:54,878 --> 00:51:57,779
I mean-- You know, one minute
we're ridin' along, we can
see everything and each other...

and, boom, the next minute is just--
you're in total darkness.

414
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:03,746
That'd scare
the bejesus outta me.

415
00:52:08,358 --> 00:52:12,818
[ Man ] Once upon a time,
there were three bears in the forest.

416

A big bear,
a medium mommy bear...

417
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:18,824
and a tiny
little baby bear.

418
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:23,201
One mornin', they were gonna eat
their breakfast porridge.

419
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:27,265
They had a big bowl,
a medium bowl and a tiny little bowl.

420
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:29,504
That porridge was too hot.

421
00:52:29,613 --> 00:52:31,843
Stupid white man.

422
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:37,351
- So they went to take a walk.
- William Blake, you go to them.

- Along came this girl. She was--
- What?

It's a test.

428
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:57,701
I don't know those people,
and they don't look very friendly.

429
00:52:57,807 --> 00:53:01,106
- What if they kill me?
- Nobody will observe.

430
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:04,044
She got sleepy, and she
went into their bedroom.

431
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:07,344
- There was a big bed, a medium
bed and a tiny little bed.
- All right.

00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:09,577
- I'll go.
- ...their tiny bed.

I'd rather not,
but I'll go.

00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:18,355
"Somebody here ate
all our porridge."

-Be quiet and go.

- All right.

438
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:28,562
and he tore her head
off her body.

439
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:33,132
And he took that golden hair,
and he made a sweater for baby bear.

- That's terrible.
- Tonight we're reminded...

of the evil emperor
Nero Augustus.

442
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:43,547
He was the scourge
of all the Christians.

443

What's a scourge?

00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:49,222
It's-- It's like when
somethin' real bad happens.

Like when everybody gets killed
and you can't do anything about it.

Like a swarm of locusts.

For the entertainment
of his guests,

448
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,968
Nero would illuminate
his whole garden...

449
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:04,006
with bodies of live Christians
covered in burning oil...

450
00:54:04,107 --> 00:54:08,237
strung up
on flaming crosses, crucified.

And at dinner,

452
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:15,844
he would have the Christians
rubbed by his guards...

453
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:19,615
with aromatic herbs
and garlic...

454
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:22,715
and sewn up into sacks.

455
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:26,125
And then they'd throw
these sacks to the wild dogs.
