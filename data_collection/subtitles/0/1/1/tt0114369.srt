1
00:00:59,085 --> 00:01:03,021
They were heard screaming at each
other for 2 hours. Nothing new.

2
00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:06,252
Then they heard the gun go off.
Both barrels.

3
00:01:07,527 --> 00:01:09,119
A crime of passion.

4
00:01:09,929 --> 00:01:11,021
Yeah.

5
00:01:11,531 --> 00:01:14,295
Just look at all the passion
on that wall.

6
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:17,029
This is a done deal.
All but the paperwork.

7
00:01:21,374 --> 00:01:22,966
Did the kid see it?

8
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:24,100
What?

9
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:25,735
The kid?

10
00:01:26,613 --> 00:01:28,547
What kind of question's that?

11
00:01:29,449 --> 00:01:34,045
We'll be real glad when we get rid of
you, Somerset. Always these questions.

12
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,818
"Did the kid see it?"
Who gives a fuck?

13
00:01:37,892 --> 00:01:39,826
He's dead.
His wife killed him.

14
00:01:39,894 --> 00:01:42,556
Anything else has nothing
to do with us.

15
00:01:51,272 --> 00:01:52,261
Detective Somerset?

16
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:55,467
I'm Detective Mills.

17
00:01:57,712 --> 00:02:01,341
Just get in town 20 minutes ago,
they dump me here.

18
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:02,383
Look...

19
00:02:02,984 --> 00:02:04,315
Mills?

20
00:02:04,385 --> 00:02:09,254
- Let's find a bar. Sit and talk...
- I'd like to get to the precinct.

21
00:02:09,324 --> 00:02:11,986
Not much time for
this transition thing.

22
00:02:13,494 --> 00:02:16,327
I had a question,
when we spoke on the phone.

23
00:02:16,397 --> 00:02:17,261
Yeah.

24
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,060
Why here?

25
00:02:20,835 --> 00:02:22,427
I don't follow.

26
00:02:22,503 --> 00:02:25,267
Well, all this effort
to get transferred.

27
00:02:26,407 --> 00:02:28,898
It's the first question
that popped into my head.

28
00:02:30,011 --> 00:02:34,345
Same reason as you. Or the reason
you had before you decided to quit.

29
00:02:37,018 --> 00:02:38,451
You just met me.

30
00:02:39,587 --> 00:02:41,953
Maybe I don't understand the question.

31
00:02:43,257 --> 00:02:44,781
It's very simple.

32
00:02:45,527 --> 00:02:49,190
You actually fought
to get reassigned here.

33
00:02:50,032 --> 00:02:53,627
- I never saw it done that way.
- Thought I'd do some good.

34
00:02:53,702 --> 00:02:58,139
It'd be great if we didn't start out
kicking each other in the balls.

35
00:03:00,042 --> 00:03:02,203
- You're calling the shots.
- Yes.

36
00:03:03,712 --> 00:03:07,148
I want you to look and
I want you to listen. Okay?

37
00:03:07,216 --> 00:03:11,380
I wasn't guarding a Taco Bell.
I've worked homicide 5 years.

38
00:03:11,453 --> 00:03:13,148
- Not here.
- I understand.

39
00:03:13,222 --> 00:03:17,659
Well, over the next 7 days, Detective,
do me the favor of remembering that.

40
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:38,336
SE7EN

41
00:06:17,975 --> 00:06:18,008
MONDAY

42
00:06:18,008 --> 00:06:21,911
MONDAY

43
00:07:02,954 --> 00:07:03,886
Yeah.

44
00:07:04,456 --> 00:07:05,445
Okay.

45
00:07:06,691 --> 00:07:07,783
Say it again?

46
00:07:10,695 --> 00:07:14,893
I thought we moved here
to get away from tractor pulls.

47
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:21,632
Serpico's got to go.

48
00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:25,142
Well, you might want
to get rid of this little...

49
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,804
crusty, this eye, Serpico.

50
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,642
- Did you get it?
- Got it.

51
00:07:29,714 --> 00:07:30,807
Good.

52
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:48,593
Coffee?

53
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:56,437
Nothing's been touched.
It's all like I found it.

54
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,272
What time was death established?

55
00:07:58,344 --> 00:07:59,777
Like I said...

56
00:07:59,845 --> 00:08:01,437
I didn't touch anything...

57
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:05,609
but he's had his face
in spaghetti for 45 minutes.

58
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:08,449
Wait. No one bothers
with vital signs?

59
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:13,390
Did I suffer? This guy ain't breathing
unless he's breathing spaghetti sauce.

60
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:16,724
- That's how it's done here?
- Excuse me, Detective.

61
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:21,631
He's sitting in his own piss and shit.
If he wasn't dead he would've stood up

62
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:24,059
- Alright.
- Thank you, Officer.

63
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,066
Thank you.

64
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:36,939
I wonder.

65
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:43,580
What was the point of the conversation
you were about to get into?

66
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:48,485
Don't know. How many times Barney Five
found dead bodies that weren't dead.

67
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:51,823
Drop it.

68
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:25,690
Somebody phone Guiness.
I think we've got a record here.

69
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:44,373
Better Homes and Gardens.

70
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:53,183
Spaghetti Sauce

71
00:09:55,396 --> 00:09:56,954
Who said this was murder?

72
00:09:57,465 --> 00:09:58,659
No one.

73
00:10:00,635 --> 00:10:02,398
Guy's heart must be the size...

74
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,835
of a canned ham.

75
00:10:06,908 --> 00:10:09,069
If this isn't a coronary...

76
00:10:09,143 --> 00:10:10,235
well...

77
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:12,343
I don't know.

78
00:10:29,497 --> 00:10:30,759
Whoops.

79
00:10:37,939 --> 00:10:39,770
How about that.

80
00:10:49,851 --> 00:10:51,842
We had this case once...

81
00:10:52,787 --> 00:10:54,778
guy dead on the ground...

82
00:10:54,856 --> 00:10:56,687
knife in his back.
Murder...

83
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:58,054
right?

84
00:11:00,128 --> 00:11:01,220
Fuck!

85
00:11:01,863 --> 00:11:05,459
Anyway, big insurance policy involved,
yeah? So the guy...

86
00:11:05,534 --> 00:11:07,024
took the tip of the blade...

87
00:11:07,102 --> 00:11:09,502
stuck it in his own shoulder blades.

88
00:11:09,571 --> 00:11:12,597
He must've screwed up
'cause there was...

89
00:11:12,674 --> 00:11:14,505
- multiples back there.
- Please be quiet.

90
00:11:24,753 --> 00:11:26,015
Wait a minute.

91
00:11:26,088 --> 00:11:27,112
What?

92
00:11:29,858 --> 00:11:31,450
Got a bucket here.

93
00:11:32,561 --> 00:11:33,653
What's in it?

94
00:11:39,535 --> 00:11:40,695
Oh God!

95
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:42,361
Fucking vomit.

96
00:11:44,706 --> 00:11:46,003
Any blood in it?

97
00:11:46,542 --> 00:11:48,976
I didn't see any.
Help yourself.

98
00:11:54,249 --> 00:11:56,217
Are you thinking it's poison?

99
00:11:57,452 --> 00:11:59,977
Oh, wonderful. Very moody.

100
00:12:00,055 --> 00:12:01,716
Think it's poison, Somerset?

101
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,884
You girls have got forensics
waiting outside.

102
00:12:05,227 --> 00:12:06,489
We might not fit.

103
00:12:06,562 --> 00:12:09,053
There's room. Light's the problem.

104
00:12:09,131 --> 00:12:10,428
How are you?

105
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,727
Det. Mills, go help the officers...

106
00:12:13,802 --> 00:12:15,327
question the neighbors.

107
00:12:18,074 --> 00:12:19,234
What?

108
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:21,038
And send in forensics.

109
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:38,090
He's dead.

110
00:12:39,596 --> 00:12:41,029
Thank you, Doctor.

111
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,604
You saw my files,
the things I've done?

112
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,929
Nope.

113
00:12:54,677 --> 00:12:58,204
I did door-to-doors and walked
the beat. I did that shit...

114
00:12:58,281 --> 00:12:59,373
a long time.

115
00:13:00,617 --> 00:13:02,278
- And?
- My badge says...

116
00:13:02,352 --> 00:13:05,253
"detective".
That's the same as yours.

117
00:13:06,522 --> 00:13:08,615
Look, I made a decision.

118
00:13:09,292 --> 00:13:12,056
I had to consider
the integrity of the scene...

119
00:13:12,128 --> 00:13:15,723
not whether you were getting
enough time on the field.

120
00:13:15,798 --> 00:13:16,890
Hey, man...

121
00:13:18,701 --> 00:13:22,296
Just don't jerk me off. That's all
I ask. Don't jerk me off.

122
00:13:28,712 --> 00:13:30,077
He's been dead...

123
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:32,809
a long time, and not from poison.

124
00:13:32,883 --> 00:13:34,316
Oh, man.

125
00:13:34,385 --> 00:13:36,478
How can you let yourself go like that?

126
00:13:37,054 --> 00:13:39,921
It took 4 orderlies just
to get him on the table.

127
00:13:42,893 --> 00:13:47,830
- How'd the fat fuck fit out his door?
- Please. Obviously he was a shut-in.

128
00:13:47,898 --> 00:13:50,992
Look. See how big this stomach is?

129
00:13:51,068 --> 00:13:53,935
And the strange thing is,
it stretches.

130
00:13:54,004 --> 00:13:57,167
Look at the size of the
cardiac orifice, where the food...

131
00:13:57,241 --> 00:14:00,005
I see that, but it means
nothing to me.

132
00:14:00,077 --> 00:14:02,602
Okay, he's got lines of distention...

133
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,272
across the duodenum.

134
00:14:04,348 --> 00:14:05,975
The interior wall's ripped open.

135
00:14:07,584 --> 00:14:10,109
This man ate till he burst?

136
00:14:10,187 --> 00:14:15,124
He didn't really burst. Not all the
way. He was hemorrhaging internally.

137
00:14:15,192 --> 00:14:18,025
There was a hematoma
in the rectus and...

138
00:14:18,095 --> 00:14:21,292
- the transverse abdominous muscles.
- He did die by eating?

139
00:14:21,365 --> 00:14:22,525
Yes and no.

140
00:14:24,768 --> 00:14:26,599
What about these bruises here?

141
00:14:28,372 --> 00:14:30,363
I haven't figured that out yet.

142
00:14:30,441 --> 00:14:32,375
Gun pressed against his head?

143
00:14:32,443 --> 00:14:33,876
Pressed hard enough.

144
00:14:33,944 --> 00:14:35,138
Fuck, yeah.

145
00:14:35,546 --> 00:14:38,141
On the front, flush with the muzzle.

146
00:14:40,285 --> 00:14:43,721
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have ourselves a homicide.

147
00:14:46,558 --> 00:14:51,154
Killer put a bucket beneath him,
kept on serving. Took his time too.

148
00:14:51,229 --> 00:14:54,164
Coroner said it could have lasted
more than 12 hours.

149
00:14:54,232 --> 00:14:57,565
Victim's throat was swollen,
probably from the effort...

150
00:14:57,635 --> 00:15:00,502
and there was a point
when he passed out.

151
00:15:00,572 --> 00:15:02,733
That's when the killer kicked him...

152
00:15:02,807 --> 00:15:04,741
- and he burst.
- Sadistic fucker.

153
00:15:05,243 --> 00:15:08,076
When you want somebody dead,
you drive by and shoot.

154
00:15:08,146 --> 00:15:11,013
You don't risk the time
it takes to do this...

155
00:15:11,082 --> 00:15:14,017
- unless the act itself has meaning.
- Come on.

156
00:15:14,486 --> 00:15:18,889
Somebody had a problem with a fat boy
and tortured him. Simple as that.

157
00:15:18,957 --> 00:15:20,219
In the grocery bags...

158
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:23,818
we found 2 receipts. So,
the killer stopped and went back...

159
00:15:23,895 --> 00:15:25,419
to the supermarket.

160
00:15:26,164 --> 00:15:27,324
So?

161
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:32,200
Man, it's his thing.
I've been out in the rain all day.

162
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,261
- This is beginning.
- We've got...

163
00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:36,204
one dead guy, not three.

164
00:15:36,274 --> 00:15:37,434
No motive.

165
00:15:38,443 --> 00:15:41,037
Don't start that big brain of yours...

166
00:15:41,112 --> 00:15:42,704
cooking on this, alright?

167
00:15:43,181 --> 00:15:45,115
I'd like to be reassigned.

168
00:15:46,351 --> 00:15:47,443
Whoa.

169
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,784
What are you talking about?

170
00:15:49,855 --> 00:15:51,789
This can't be my last duty.

171
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,519
It'll go on and on.

172
00:15:54,026 --> 00:15:56,620
You're retiring in 6 days.

173
00:15:56,695 --> 00:15:59,721
You've left unfinished
business before.

174
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:03,792
Those cases were taken as close
to conclusion as possible.

175
00:16:04,637 --> 00:16:07,071
- And if I may speak freely?
- We're friends here.

176
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:08,902
It's his first assignment.

177
00:16:08,974 --> 00:16:12,967
I knew it. This is not
my first assignment, you dick.

178
00:16:13,045 --> 00:16:14,239
It's too soon.

179
00:16:14,313 --> 00:16:17,646
I'm here. You can say that
shit to my face. Captain?

180
00:16:17,716 --> 00:16:18,910
It's too soon for you.

181
00:16:19,985 --> 00:16:20,974
Captain...

182
00:16:21,053 --> 00:16:23,146
Can we talk in private?

183
00:16:23,222 --> 00:16:24,655
This is a personal thing--

184
00:16:25,057 --> 00:16:26,490
Just shut up, Mills.

185
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:28,424
I don't have anyone else...

186
00:16:28,494 --> 00:16:31,827
to put on this and you know it.
This is Metro...

187
00:16:31,897 --> 00:16:34,798
- you don't just get to swap.
- Give it to me.

188
00:16:36,168 --> 00:16:39,433
He wants out, fuck him.
See you, have a nice time.

189
00:16:39,505 --> 00:16:40,767
Give it to me.

190
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,808
I'll put you on something else.

191
00:16:45,411 --> 00:16:47,641
Go on, Mills, just go on.

192
00:16:53,686 --> 00:16:56,951
I'm sorry, old buddy,
but it looks like you're stuck...

193
00:16:57,022 --> 00:16:58,785
cleaning up the fat man.

194
00:17:06,132 --> 00:17:06,233
TUESDAY

195
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:09,396
TUESDAY

196
00:17:11,338 --> 00:17:14,102
MURDER HAS A NEW UPTOWN ADDRESS!

197
00:17:14,174 --> 00:17:16,005
ATTORNEY FOUND MURDERED

198
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,601
Quiet down.

199
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:21,945
Alright, calm down. Calm down.

200
00:17:22,516 --> 00:17:24,006
Quiet down.

201
00:17:27,687 --> 00:17:29,120
Here's how it'll work:

202
00:17:29,689 --> 00:17:33,284
I'll answer questions for 10 minutes
and 10 minutes only.

203
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:38,695
Ask those questions in a calm, sane,
orderly fashion or I will leave.

204
00:17:38,765 --> 00:17:40,630
Detective? Detective?

205
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,634
- Can I have a moment?
- No.

206
00:17:47,874 --> 00:17:52,538
I won't discuss the details of this
investigation, so don't bother asking.

207
00:18:11,732 --> 00:18:13,393
What you got for me?

208
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,991
Nothing yet, boss.

209
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:21,469
Why don't you guys go get
a coffee, huh?

210
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:27,175
We have this breaking story.
Let's go downtown where attorney...

211
00:18:27,248 --> 00:18:29,842
Eli Gould was found murdered today.

212
00:18:29,917 --> 00:18:34,354
District Attorney Martin Talbot
is taking questions from reporters.

213
00:18:38,593 --> 00:18:40,857
That's ridiculous and offensive.

214
00:18:40,928 --> 00:18:45,763
There is no conflict, and any claim
there could be is irresponsible.

215
00:18:47,101 --> 00:18:48,363
Now hold on.

216
00:18:49,937 --> 00:18:53,771
I just met with law enforcement
officials and they...

217
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:58,073
assured me that they have their
very best men on this.

218
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:01,106
This will be the very definition...

219
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,883
of swift justice.

220
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:08,121
GREED

221
00:19:27,643 --> 00:19:29,235
Pardon me, George.

222
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:34,739
Somerset.

223
00:19:34,816 --> 00:19:35,976
Come in.

224
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:38,752
You heard the news?

225
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,253
Nope, haven't heard.

226
00:19:40,322 --> 00:19:43,155
Eli Gould was found
murdered this morning.

227
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:46,661
Someone broke into his law firm
and bled him to death.

228
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:49,757
Wrote the word "greed"
on the floor.

229
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:58,368
- Greed?
- Yeah, in blood.

230
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,806
Mills is heading the investigation.

231
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,377
Excuse me. Excuse me.

232
00:20:04,646 --> 00:20:05,840
Don't do that, please?

233
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:10,915
Good for him.

234
00:20:10,986 --> 00:20:12,419
What will you do...

235
00:20:12,487 --> 00:20:14,580
with yourself out there, Somerset?

236
00:20:14,656 --> 00:20:17,921
Oh, I'll work, maybe on a farm.
Fix my house.

237
00:20:17,993 --> 00:20:19,426
Don't you feel it?

238
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:21,691
Don't you feel that feeling?

239
00:20:22,497 --> 00:20:25,091
You're not going to be a cop anymore.

240
00:20:25,167 --> 00:20:26,930
That's the whole idea.

241
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,103
I don't think you'll leave.

242
00:20:30,972 --> 00:20:33,032
Hell, you can't leave all this.

243
00:20:35,445 --> 00:20:37,436
Guy's out walking his dog.

244
00:20:37,513 --> 00:20:39,037
Gets attacked.

245
00:20:39,449 --> 00:20:42,043
His watch is taken, his wallet.

246
00:20:42,118 --> 00:20:43,449
And while he's lying...

247
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:45,111
on the sidewalk helpless...

248
00:20:45,855 --> 00:20:48,619
his attacker stabs him in both eyes.

249
00:20:50,193 --> 00:20:52,991
This happened last night
about 4 blocks from here.

250
00:20:53,863 --> 00:20:54,921
I read about it.

251
00:20:55,865 --> 00:20:57,765
I don't understand anymore.

252
00:20:58,201 --> 00:21:00,032
It's the way it's always been.

253
00:21:00,103 --> 00:21:03,971
- Maybe you're right.
- This work is what you're made for.

254
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,133
I don't think you can deny that.

255
00:21:07,276 --> 00:21:08,800
Maybe I'm wrong.

256
00:21:11,114 --> 00:21:13,378
The coroner sent this down for you.

257
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:16,484
Found them in
the fat boy's stomach...

258
00:21:16,886 --> 00:21:20,322
mixed in with the food.
Looks like little pieces of...

259
00:21:20,389 --> 00:21:22,152
- plastic.
- Set them on that desk.

260
00:21:26,462 --> 00:21:27,986
They were...

261
00:21:28,064 --> 00:21:29,292
fed to him.

262
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:09,822
Lord.

263
00:23:09,901 --> 00:23:11,664
GLUTTONY

264
00:23:18,176 --> 00:23:22,613
This was found behind the refrigerator
in the obesity murder scene.

265
00:23:23,915 --> 00:23:25,610
"Long is the way

266
00:23:25,683 --> 00:23:28,948
And hard, that out of hell
leads up to light."

267
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,282
It's from Milton.

268
00:23:30,989 --> 00:23:32,456
"Paradise Lost."

269
00:23:33,024 --> 00:23:34,013
Alright...

270
00:23:34,092 --> 00:23:35,286
I'm confused.

271
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,794
It means that this is beginning.

272
00:23:37,862 --> 00:23:39,124
GLUTTONY

273
00:23:39,197 --> 00:23:41,290
This was behind
the same refrigerator...

274
00:23:41,699 --> 00:23:43,690
written in grease.

275
00:23:43,768 --> 00:23:45,861
There are 7 deadly sins, Captain.

276
00:23:46,437 --> 00:23:47,699
Gluttony...

277
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:51,364
greed...

278
00:23:53,778 --> 00:23:55,973
sloth, wrath...

279
00:23:56,047 --> 00:23:58,174
pride, lust...

280
00:23:58,783 --> 00:23:59,977
and envy.

281
00:24:00,485 --> 00:24:01,543
Seven.

282
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:02,551
Hold on.

283
00:24:03,121 --> 00:24:05,453
This is not even my desk.

284
00:24:06,358 --> 00:24:08,622
You can expect five more of these.

285
00:24:10,229 --> 00:24:11,457
Wait a minute.

286
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:14,891
I can't get involved in this.

287
00:24:17,102 --> 00:24:18,330
Somerset.

288
00:24:18,938 --> 00:24:20,166
He wanted it.

289
00:24:21,807 --> 00:24:23,001
Damn!

290
00:24:23,075 --> 00:24:24,565
I'm all over it.

291
00:24:59,078 --> 00:25:00,045
Where to?

292
00:25:03,282 --> 00:25:05,216
Far away from here.

293
00:25:17,263 --> 00:25:19,788
- Just a few things to look up.
- Okay.

294
00:25:19,866 --> 00:25:21,561
Sit where you'd like.

295
00:25:22,369 --> 00:25:23,666
How's everybody?

296
00:25:24,704 --> 00:25:26,228
Hiya, Smiley.

297
00:25:26,973 --> 00:25:29,168
George, the cards are getting cold.

298
00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:31,071
Duty calls.

299
00:25:46,993 --> 00:25:48,654
Gentlemen? Gentlemen...

300
00:25:49,396 --> 00:25:50,863
I'll never understand.

301
00:25:52,165 --> 00:25:53,928
All these books...

302
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,434
a world of knowledge right here...

303
00:25:56,503 --> 00:25:57,663
and what do you do?

304
00:25:58,505 --> 00:25:59,995
You play poker all night.

305
00:26:00,507 --> 00:26:02,441
Hey, we got culture.

306
00:26:02,509 --> 00:26:05,103
Yeah, we got culture
coming out of our asses.

307
00:26:08,581 --> 00:26:10,344
How's this for culture?

308
00:26:39,346 --> 00:26:41,177

Dante's Purgatory
The Canterbury Tales

313
00:28:12,674 --> 00:28:14,665
was crimson with his blood:

314
00:28:25,687 --> 00:28:27,780
Even children slain!

315
00:28:48,443 --> 00:28:49,705
You know, Smiley...

316
00:28:50,546 --> 00:28:52,480
you'll really miss us.

317
00:28:54,283 --> 00:28:55,716
I just might.

WEDNESDAY

322
00:29:53,609 --> 00:29:55,201
Fucking Dante.

323
00:29:55,778 --> 00:29:59,839
Goddamn poetry-writing fatggot
piece of shit.

324
00:30:00,383 --> 00:30:01,441
Fucker.

325
00:30:12,629 --> 00:30:14,119
Good work, Officer.

326
00:30:21,138 --> 00:30:22,901
Thank you, Lord.

327
00:30:30,881 --> 00:30:32,405
Oh, oh, sorry.

328
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,815
I'll move in a second.

329
00:30:48,332 --> 00:30:50,926
- You want your chair?
- You go ahead.

330
00:30:51,001 --> 00:30:51,831
Yeah?

331
00:31:30,708 --> 00:31:31,504
Phone.

332
00:31:32,677 --> 00:31:35,145
Package deal.
Comes with the office.

333
00:31:40,284 --> 00:31:41,308
Mills.

334
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,212
Honey...

335
00:31:43,287 --> 00:31:45,152
You okay? Something wrong?

336
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:50,022
You dingleberry, I told you
not to call me here when I'm working.

337
00:31:51,229 --> 00:31:52,662
Yeah. Why?

338
00:31:55,299 --> 00:31:56,732
Why?

339
00:32:01,472 --> 00:32:02,734
Okay.

340
00:32:06,644 --> 00:32:07,838
It's my wife.

341
00:32:08,246 --> 00:32:09,372
Sorry?

342
00:32:10,648 --> 00:32:12,309
She'd like to speak to you.

343
00:32:22,427 --> 00:32:24,259
This is Detective Somerset.

344
00:32:26,265 --> 00:32:29,029
Well, yes, it's nice
to talk to you too.

345
00:32:30,669 --> 00:32:33,035
I appreciate the offer, but...

346
00:32:35,607 --> 00:32:37,871
Well, in that case I'd be delighted.

347
00:32:38,844 --> 00:32:40,778
Yes, thank you very much.

348
00:32:42,014 --> 00:32:43,106
Bye.

349
00:32:45,851 --> 00:32:47,113
Honey, what...?

350
00:32:55,127 --> 00:32:56,560
Well?

351
00:32:56,628 --> 00:32:57,925
Sorry?

352
00:32:59,298 --> 00:33:03,632
I'm invited to late supper
at your apartment. I accepted.

353
00:33:03,702 --> 00:33:05,533
At my... How's that?

354
00:33:06,205 --> 00:33:07,137
Tonight.

355
00:33:14,213 --> 00:33:16,147
Hello, men.

356
00:33:16,215 --> 00:33:17,477
- Hi, loser.
- Hi, idiot.

357
00:33:20,352 --> 00:33:21,717
That's Tracy. Tracy...

358
00:33:23,489 --> 00:33:24,581
Hello.

359
00:33:25,057 --> 00:33:27,457
Glad to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

360
00:33:28,727 --> 00:33:30,718
Except your first name.

361
00:33:31,997 --> 00:33:33,328
It's William.

362
00:33:34,066 --> 00:33:36,331
Well, it's a good name...

363
00:33:36,402 --> 00:33:37,426
William.

364
00:33:38,171 --> 00:33:40,332
William, I'd like you to meet David.

365
00:33:40,406 --> 00:33:44,342
- David, this is William.
- Alright, I'll be right back.

366
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:47,607
- How are the kids?
- Good. They're in the room. Come in.

367
00:33:49,415 --> 00:33:51,178
Aw, good dogs.

368
00:33:51,251 --> 00:33:54,186
How are all the good dogs?
How are you, pretty?

369
00:34:05,198 --> 00:34:06,790
Smells good.

370
00:34:08,835 --> 00:34:11,133
Yeah, I mean, thank you.

371
00:34:11,871 --> 00:34:14,135
Please have a seat, if you like.

372
00:34:14,207 --> 00:34:18,200
- Would you like a drink?
- No. Thanks. I'll wait.

373
00:34:18,945 --> 00:34:22,142
Throw that anywhere.
Excuse all this mess.

374
00:34:22,215 --> 00:34:23,876
We're still unpacking.

375
00:34:26,452 --> 00:34:29,046
I hear you were
high school sweethearts.

376
00:34:31,457 --> 00:34:33,049
Pretty hokey, huh?

377
00:34:34,294 --> 00:34:35,727
You know something?

378
00:34:36,296 --> 00:34:38,821
On our first date I knew he was...

379
00:34:38,898 --> 00:34:40,388
- the guy I'd marry.
- Really?

380
00:34:41,901 --> 00:34:44,233
He was the funniest guy I ever met.

381
00:34:48,976 --> 00:34:50,136
Really.

382
00:34:53,247 --> 00:34:55,681
It's kind of rare nowadays.

383
00:34:55,749 --> 00:34:58,013
I mean, that level of...

384
00:34:58,085 --> 00:34:59,177
commitment.

385
00:35:03,991 --> 00:35:05,424
Oh, don't worry.

386
00:35:05,993 --> 00:35:08,257
I won't wear it to the dinner table.

387
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:11,192
No matter...

388
00:35:11,265 --> 00:35:13,927
how often I see guns,
I just can't...

389
00:35:14,001 --> 00:35:15,434
get used to them.

390
00:35:16,503 --> 00:35:17,731
Same here.

391
00:35:28,048 --> 00:35:30,710
- Why aren't you married, William?
- Tracy.

392
00:35:30,784 --> 00:35:32,046
What the hell?

393
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:33,814
I was close once.

394
00:35:34,888 --> 00:35:36,150
It just didn't happen.

395
00:35:36,223 --> 00:35:38,157
It surprises me.

396
00:35:38,792 --> 00:35:40,316
It really does.

397
00:35:41,729 --> 00:35:42,753
Well...

398
00:35:44,231 --> 00:35:48,395
Anyone who spends a significant amount
of time with me finds me disagreeable.

399
00:35:49,303 --> 00:35:50,736
Just ask your husband.

400
00:35:50,804 --> 00:35:51,896
Very true.

401
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:54,070
Very, very true.

402
00:35:54,808 --> 00:35:56,901
How long have you lived here?

403
00:35:57,746 --> 00:35:58,838
Too long.

404
00:36:02,817 --> 00:36:04,148
How do you like it?

405
00:36:06,087 --> 00:36:07,247
You know...

406
00:36:07,756 --> 00:36:10,088
takes time. Settle in...

407
00:36:11,326 --> 00:36:12,816
it'll be good.

408
00:36:12,894 --> 00:36:15,021
Well, you get numb after awhile

409
00:36:16,498 --> 00:36:18,432
There are things to any city...

410
00:36:24,172 --> 00:36:25,366
Subway.

411
00:36:25,774 --> 00:36:27,867
It'll go away in a minute.

412
00:36:31,613 --> 00:36:33,274
This real estate guy.

413
00:36:33,948 --> 00:36:36,542
Fucking piece of...
Sorry, honey.

414
00:36:37,452 --> 00:36:40,717
He shows us the place a few times,
I think he's good.

415
00:36:40,789 --> 00:36:43,451
He's efficient.
Tracy really likes him.

416
00:36:43,858 --> 00:36:48,227
Then I start wondering why he'll only
bring us here 5 minutes at a time.

417
00:36:48,296 --> 00:36:50,196
We found out the first night.

418
00:36:50,632 --> 00:36:52,964
The soothing, relaxing...

419
00:36:53,468 --> 00:36:55,299
vibrating home, huh?

420
00:37:03,812 --> 00:37:05,143
I'm sorry.

421
00:37:12,321 --> 00:37:14,255
Yeah, alright, laugh it up.

422
00:37:16,992 --> 00:37:19,392
I don't know why you're laughing.

423
00:37:23,232 --> 00:37:24,927
Alright, already.

424
00:37:29,004 --> 00:37:31,165
He had to get into the building...

425
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:35,267
before the office closed.
Gould would have been working late?

426
00:37:35,344 --> 00:37:38,575
I'm certain. He was the biggest
defense lawyer in town.

427
00:37:38,647 --> 00:37:42,014
- Infamous, really.
- Body was found on Tuesday morning.

428
00:37:42,084 --> 00:37:46,521
The office was closed on Monday.
So he could have gotten in on Friday.

429
00:37:46,589 --> 00:37:49,649
Laid low till the cleaning crew left,
then had...

430
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:53,183
his way with Gould Saturday, Sunday,
maybe Monday.

431
00:37:53,696 --> 00:37:54,526
Look.

432
00:37:55,598 --> 00:37:57,395
Gould was bound, right arm free.

433
00:37:57,466 --> 00:37:59,627
He was handed a butcher's knife.

434
00:38:01,604 --> 00:38:03,504
Check out the scale.

435
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:04,834
A pound of flesh.

436
00:38:11,614 --> 00:38:13,047
"One pound of flesh"

437
00:38:13,115 --> 00:38:15,606
"No more no less
No cartilage...

438
00:38:15,684 --> 00:38:16,878
No bone....

439
00:38:16,952 --> 00:38:19,318
only flesh". "Merchant of Venice."

440
00:38:19,388 --> 00:38:20,720
Didn't see it.

441
00:38:20,791 --> 00:38:23,851
"This task done...
And he would Go Free".

442
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,054
I tell you that chair was...

443
00:38:26,129 --> 00:38:28,825
- soaked through with sweat.
- Of course.

444
00:38:29,466 --> 00:38:32,230
The killer wanted Gould
to take his time...

445
00:38:32,736 --> 00:38:34,727
deciding which cut....

446
00:38:34,805 --> 00:38:35,999
to make first.

447
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:38,005
Imagine it.

448
00:38:38,074 --> 00:38:39,905
There's a gun in your face.

449
00:38:40,577 --> 00:38:42,875
Which part of your body
is expendable?

450
00:38:43,513 --> 00:38:45,242
The love handle.

451
00:38:45,749 --> 00:38:48,343
Cut along the side
of his own stomach.

452
00:38:48,819 --> 00:38:53,051
Let's take a fresh look at these.
The corpse is there, but...

453
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:56,581
Iook through it.
Edit out your initial shock.

454
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:01,688
The trick is to find one item,
one detail and focus on it...

455
00:39:01,765 --> 00:39:04,199
until it's an exhausted possibility.

456
00:39:04,267 --> 00:39:06,235
I'll get another beer. Beer?

457
00:39:06,303 --> 00:39:08,100
Wine, please.

458
00:39:17,013 --> 00:39:18,378
He's preaching.

459
00:39:19,015 --> 00:39:20,277
Punishing.

460
00:39:22,285 --> 00:39:25,277
The sins were used
in medieval sermons.

461
00:39:26,122 --> 00:39:28,249
7 cardinal virtues,
7 deadly sins...

462
00:39:28,325 --> 00:39:31,591
- used as teaching tools.
- Yeah. Like in...

463
00:39:31,662 --> 00:39:35,359
- "The Parson's Tale," and Dante.
- You read them?

464
00:39:35,433 --> 00:39:36,559
Yeah.

465
00:39:36,634 --> 00:39:39,102
Parts. Remember in "Purgatory"...

466
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:43,664
Dante and his buddy climb up the hill
and check out all the sinners?

467
00:39:44,842 --> 00:39:48,505
- The Seven Terraces of Purgation.
- Yeah, right.

468
00:39:48,579 --> 00:39:51,946
But there pride comes first,
not gluttony.

469
00:39:52,016 --> 00:39:53,506
For now let's consider...

470
00:39:53,584 --> 00:39:56,576
the books as the killer's inspiration.

471
00:39:56,654 --> 00:39:59,623
The sermons were about atonement
for sin.

472
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:02,124
These murders are like
forced attrition.

473
00:40:02,193 --> 00:40:03,683
Forced what?

474
00:40:03,761 --> 00:40:06,958
Attrition's when you regret your sins,
but not because...

475
00:40:07,031 --> 00:40:10,933
- you love God.
- Because there's a gun in your face.

476
00:40:14,772 --> 00:40:15,966
No fingerprints.

477
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,473
Nope.

478
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:20,635
- Totally unrelated victims.
- Yep.

479
00:40:20,711 --> 00:40:23,475
And no witnesses of any kind.

480
00:40:23,547 --> 00:40:25,208
Which I don't get...

481
00:40:25,283 --> 00:40:28,218
because the fucker
had to get back out.

482
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:33,386
In any major city, minding
your own business is a science.

483
00:40:34,158 --> 00:40:37,685
In rape prevention, the first thing
they teach you is never cry for help.

484
00:40:38,496 --> 00:40:40,157
Always yell, "Fire!".

485
00:40:40,231 --> 00:40:41,664
Nobody answers help.

486
00:40:41,732 --> 00:40:43,758
Holler "fire," they'll come.

487
00:40:43,835 --> 00:40:45,564
That's fucked up.

488
00:40:45,637 --> 00:40:48,401
He must have left
another puzzle piece.

489
00:40:50,475 --> 00:40:54,741
You know what? Thank you for talking
this out, but I must sleep.

490
00:40:55,147 --> 00:40:56,409
Walk the dogs.

491
00:40:56,481 --> 00:40:59,006
This is just to satisfy my curiosity.

492
00:40:59,084 --> 00:41:03,077
- I'm leaving at the end of the week.
- Shit. No, wait.

493
00:41:04,656 --> 00:41:07,682
Gould's wife. She was out of town
at the time.

494
00:41:07,759 --> 00:41:11,092
- So this means she saw something.
- What if it's a threat?

495
00:41:11,163 --> 00:41:15,190
I put her in a safe house.
She wasn't too happy about it.

496
00:41:23,075 --> 00:41:25,703
What if it isn't what she has seen...

497
00:41:25,777 --> 00:41:30,009
but what she's supposed to see
but hasn't had the chance?

498
00:41:30,082 --> 00:41:31,879
Yeah, okay. What?

499
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:33,440
I don't know.

500
00:41:35,287 --> 00:41:37,221
But that's the one thing.

501
00:42:22,668 --> 00:42:23,999
I'll sign us in.

502
00:42:24,504 --> 00:42:25,994
Must see Mrs. Gould.

503
00:42:32,745 --> 00:42:34,110
Mrs. Gould?

504
00:42:40,253 --> 00:42:42,813
Mrs. Gould, I'm sorry.
I truly am.

505
00:42:43,523 --> 00:42:45,320
I don't understand.

506
00:42:45,758 --> 00:42:48,386
I need you to look at each photo...

507
00:42:48,895 --> 00:42:50,522
very carefully.

508
00:42:50,596 --> 00:42:54,191
Look and see if there's anything
strange or...

509
00:42:54,267 --> 00:42:56,861
out of place, anything at all.

510
00:42:57,770 --> 00:42:59,135
I don't see anything.

511
00:43:00,106 --> 00:43:02,700
Please, I can't do this right now.

512
00:43:02,775 --> 00:43:03,867
Okay.

513
00:43:05,045 --> 00:43:06,535
It's got to be now.

514
00:43:06,613 --> 00:43:08,547
There may be something we missed.

515
00:43:18,125 --> 00:43:19,319
Wait.

516
00:43:19,393 --> 00:43:20,360
What?

517
00:43:20,427 --> 00:43:21,485
Here.

518
00:43:24,965 --> 00:43:28,059
This painting, it's upside down.

519
00:43:35,809 --> 00:43:37,902
- Your men didn't move this?
- No.

520
00:43:37,978 --> 00:43:40,344
Those shots were taken
before forensics.

521
00:43:43,817 --> 00:43:44,909
Nothing.

522
00:43:46,153 --> 00:43:48,178
There's got to be something.

523
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:01,761
- He moved the screws to rehang it.
- Yep.

524
00:44:06,106 --> 00:44:07,698
What the fuck is that?

525
00:44:09,176 --> 00:44:10,609
Switchblade.

526
00:44:18,786 --> 00:44:20,549
Goddamn it.

527
00:44:23,858 --> 00:44:26,292
There must be something.

528
00:44:31,466 --> 00:44:33,559
He didn't paint the fucking thing.

529
00:44:41,476 --> 00:44:44,445
No, he's fucking with us,
that's what he's doing.

530
00:44:45,647 --> 00:44:47,877
See this, this is us.

531
00:44:49,651 --> 00:44:51,312
Just wait a minute.

532
00:44:54,122 --> 00:44:57,421
- Somerset's climbing on the furniture.
- Wait a minute.

533
00:45:02,997 --> 00:45:04,862
You're kidding me.

534
00:45:04,933 --> 00:45:06,924
Call the print lab.

535
00:45:12,173 --> 00:45:13,504
Oh, man.

536
00:45:17,011 --> 00:45:18,444
Honestly...

537
00:45:18,513 --> 00:45:21,107
have you ever seen anything like this?

538
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,879
HELP ME

539
00:45:26,956 --> 00:45:29,891
The swell pattern tells me
that they're not...

540
00:45:29,959 --> 00:45:32,223
the victim's fingerprints.

541
00:45:42,571 --> 00:45:44,471
I don't know, man.

542
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:46,667
I say he's whacked enough.

543
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:49,604
It doesn't fit.

544
00:45:50,412 --> 00:45:52,073
He doesn't want to stop.

545
00:45:52,147 --> 00:45:53,239
Who knows.

546
00:45:53,315 --> 00:45:57,479
Freaks out there doing their
evil deeds they don't want to do.

547
00:45:57,553 --> 00:46:00,078
"The voices made me do it".

548
00:46:00,155 --> 00:46:02,089
"Jodie Foster made me do it".

549
00:46:02,157 --> 00:46:03,624
It can take...

550
00:46:03,692 --> 00:46:07,788
3 days to make a match,
so maybe you guys want to cross...

551
00:46:07,863 --> 00:46:09,592
your fingers somewhere else.

552
00:46:13,168 --> 00:46:16,103
You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould,
didn't you?

553
00:46:16,171 --> 00:46:17,934
About catching this guy.

554
00:46:21,443 --> 00:46:24,037
Wish I still thought
the way you did.

555
00:46:25,514 --> 00:46:28,881
Tell me what the hell it is
you think we're doing?

556
00:46:29,785 --> 00:46:31,650
Picking up the pieces.

557
00:46:33,155 --> 00:46:38,059
We're collecting all the evidence,
taking all the pictures and samples...

558
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:40,221
writing everything down...

559
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:42,629
noting the time things happened.

560
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,059
That's all?

561
00:46:45,669 --> 00:46:47,227
That's all.

562
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:51,070
Putting everything into neat piles
and filing it away...

563
00:46:51,641 --> 00:46:55,133
on the off chance it'll be needed
in the courtroom.

564
00:46:57,814 --> 00:47:01,079
Picking up diamonds
on a deserted island...

565
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:04,314
saving them in case we get rescued.

566
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:08,414
Bullshit.

567
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:14,961
Even the most promising clues
usually only lead to others.

568
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:19,767
So many corpses roll away unrevenged.

569
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:26,334
Don't try to tell me you didn't
get that rush tonight.

570
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:28,943
I saw you.

571
00:47:29,846 --> 00:47:31,837
We're getting somewhere.

572
00:47:41,991 --> 00:47:42,025
THURSDAY

573
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:44,585
THURSDAY

574
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,026
Wake up, Glimmer Twins.

575
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:50,959
We got a winner.

576
00:47:57,174 --> 00:48:00,940
He uses the name Victor.
His real name is Theodore Allen.

577
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:03,639
Homicide found his prints
at the scene.

578
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:07,377
He's got a long history
of serious mental illnesses.

579
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:10,113
He got a very strict
Southern Baptist upbringing.

580
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:13,647
Somewhere along the line
they fell short.

581
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:17,216
Victor dabbled in drugs, armed robbery
and assault, spent time...

582
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:20,491
in prison for the attempted rape
of a minor.

583
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:24,398
His lawyer made sure that didn't
last long. By the way...

584
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:27,232
the lawyer was Eli Gould,
the "greed" victim.

585
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:30,004
We'll stop this today,
ladies and germs.

586
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:34,568
Victor's been out of circulation for
awhile, but we've a residence for him.

587
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:37,170
- You're not buying this?
- Doesn't seem...

588
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:38,840
Iike our guy, does it?

589
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:39,974
You tell me.

590
00:48:41,152 --> 00:48:43,313
Our killer seems to have
more purpose.

591
00:49:12,184 --> 00:49:13,674
You ever take a bullet?

592
00:49:13,752 --> 00:49:16,880
Never in my thirty-four years,
knock on wood.

593
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:20,282
I've only taken my gun out...

594
00:49:20,358 --> 00:49:22,883
3 times wanting to use it.

595
00:49:22,961 --> 00:49:24,622
Never pulled the trigger.

596
00:49:24,696 --> 00:49:25,890
Not once.

597
00:49:26,431 --> 00:49:27,261
You?

598
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:31,633
Yeah. No, I never took a bullet,
but...

599
00:49:31,703 --> 00:49:34,297
I pulled my gun once.
Shot it once.

600
00:49:34,372 --> 00:49:36,465
- Really?
- It was my first one of these.

601
00:49:36,541 --> 00:49:38,736
We were a secondary unit.

602
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:41,643
I was pretty shaky going in.
I was a rookie.

603
00:49:42,047 --> 00:49:46,814
We bust open the door looking for this
junkie, the fucker opened fire on us.

604
00:49:48,053 --> 00:49:49,987
One cop got hit in the arm.

605
00:49:52,057 --> 00:49:53,752
Christ, what was his name?

606
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:59,820
It spun him like a top... no, Well,
more, you know, more like slow motion.

607
00:50:01,233 --> 00:50:02,825
I remember...

608
00:50:04,503 --> 00:50:06,095
riding in that ambulance...

609
00:50:06,171 --> 00:50:07,502
and, well...

610
00:50:07,572 --> 00:50:09,005
he died right there.

611
00:50:09,407 --> 00:50:10,601
Right there.

612
00:50:11,511 --> 00:50:13,741
Christ, what was his fucking name?

613
00:51:31,658 --> 00:51:34,183
SWAT goes before dicks.

614
00:51:37,931 --> 00:51:39,421
They love this.

615
00:51:40,334 --> 00:51:41,392
Police!

616
00:51:46,607 --> 00:51:47,596
Clear!

617
00:52:12,299 --> 00:52:13,732
Good morning, sweetheart.

618
00:52:15,035 --> 00:52:17,799
Get up now, motherfucker. Now!

619
00:52:27,047 --> 00:52:28,810
Get up, you sack of shit.

620
00:52:35,723 --> 00:52:36,883
Oh, fuck me.

621
00:52:37,492 --> 00:52:38,424
Dicks!

622
00:52:39,127 --> 00:52:41,254
You'll want to come
take a look at this.

623
00:52:44,632 --> 00:52:45,758
Dicks!

624
00:52:53,074 --> 00:52:54,336
Jesus.

625
00:52:54,409 --> 00:52:55,603
Victor?

626
00:52:55,677 --> 00:52:58,111
- What the hell?
- It's just Victor.

627
00:52:58,179 --> 00:52:59,840
- Call an ambulance.
- What the fuck?

628
00:52:59,914 --> 00:53:01,279
Hearse, I'd say.

629
00:53:01,349 --> 00:53:02,839
Call for forensics.

630
00:53:02,917 --> 00:53:04,509
Get your people out.

631
00:53:04,585 --> 00:53:06,348
No one touches anything.

632
00:53:06,421 --> 00:53:08,753
It's like a frigging wax sculpture.

633
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,022
Sloth.

634
00:53:23,771 --> 00:53:24,965
Aw, man.

635
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:26,301
Goddamn.

636
00:53:26,774 --> 00:53:29,140
Those pictures were dated 3 days ago.

637
00:53:37,452 --> 00:53:38,976
This must be the first.

638
00:53:39,053 --> 00:53:39,917
Look.

639
00:53:40,722 --> 00:53:43,213
It's dated exactly one year ago today.

640
00:53:45,127 --> 00:53:46,992
I got a hair sample. I got a...

641
00:53:47,062 --> 00:53:49,326
stool sample. I got piss. I got...

642
00:53:49,398 --> 00:53:50,729
fingernails.

643
00:53:53,068 --> 00:53:54,467
He's laughing at us.

644
00:53:54,536 --> 00:53:56,834
You got what you deserved.

645
00:54:00,743 --> 00:54:02,176
He's alive! Cocksucker's alive!

646
00:54:03,245 --> 00:54:04,576
Guns down!

647
00:54:04,646 --> 00:54:06,910
Guns down!
Emergency on that ambulance!

648
00:54:24,066 --> 00:54:26,660
- He's playing games.
- Aw, no shit.

649
00:54:29,104 --> 00:54:31,538
We must forget our emotion.

650
00:54:31,607 --> 00:54:36,601
- We must focus on the details
- I feed off my emotions. How's that?

651
00:54:36,678 --> 00:54:38,111
Are you listening to me?

652
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:39,670
Yes, I can hear you.

653
00:54:39,748 --> 00:54:41,443
- Excuse me.
- What are you doing?

654
00:54:41,517 --> 00:54:44,281
- Closed crime scene. Leave.
- I got a right to be here.

655
00:54:44,353 --> 00:54:45,718
I'm a U.P.I. photographer.

656
00:54:46,722 --> 00:54:48,747
I got a fucking right to be here.

657
00:54:48,824 --> 00:54:50,655
- Get out! Jesus.
- Fucking jerk.

658
00:54:50,726 --> 00:54:52,660
I got your picture, man.

659
00:54:52,728 --> 00:54:54,992
- I got your picture.
- Yeah, yeah.

660
00:54:55,063 --> 00:54:57,931
Detective Mills.
M-l-L-L-S. Fuck off.

661
00:54:58,001 --> 00:54:59,764
- You can spell!
- Fuck you!

662
00:55:00,603 --> 00:55:03,003
How they get here so fucking quick?

663
00:55:03,072 --> 00:55:06,667
They pay police for the information.
And they pay well.

664
00:55:07,343 --> 00:55:09,334
Hey man, I'm sorry.

665
00:55:11,414 --> 00:55:12,847
They piss me off.

666
00:55:12,916 --> 00:55:14,178
It's okay.

667
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:16,878
It's impressive to see a man
feeding off his emotions.

668
00:55:23,793 --> 00:55:29,060
1 year of immobility's right, judging
by the muscle and spine deterioration.

669
00:55:29,132 --> 00:55:32,795
Blood tests show a smorgasbord
of drugs in his system.

670
00:55:32,869 --> 00:55:37,738
Even an antibiotic, probably to keep
the bed sores from infecting.

671
00:55:38,374 --> 00:55:42,470
Now, has he tried to speak
or communicate in any way?

672
00:55:42,545 --> 00:55:45,412
Even if his brain were not mush,
which it is...

673
00:55:45,481 --> 00:55:47,972
he chewed off his tongue long ago.

674
00:55:50,486 --> 00:55:51,418
Doc.

675
00:55:52,655 --> 00:55:55,647
Is there absolutely no chance
that he might survive?

676
00:55:56,492 --> 00:56:01,156
He'd die of shock right now if you
shone a flashlight in his eyes.

677
00:56:01,998 --> 00:56:06,833
He's had as much pain and suffering as
anyone I've encountered, give or take

678
00:56:07,905 --> 00:56:10,499
and he still has hell
to look forward to.

679
00:56:10,908 --> 00:56:12,170
Good night.

680
00:56:25,189 --> 00:56:26,850
Hello, William.

681
00:56:26,924 --> 00:56:28,516
It's Tracy.

682
00:56:29,093 --> 00:56:30,151
Tracy?

683
00:56:30,794 --> 00:56:31,852
Everything okay?

684
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:35,130
Yeah. Yes, everything's fine.

685
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:36,325
Where's David?

686
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,699
He's in the other room.
He's in the shower.

687
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:42,796
I'm sorry to call you like this.

688
00:56:42,873 --> 00:56:44,363
Oh, it's all right.

689
00:56:45,376 --> 00:56:46,843
What can I do for you?

690
00:56:52,449 --> 00:56:54,474
I need someone to talk...

691
00:56:54,551 --> 00:56:57,486
to. Do you think you could meet me...

692
00:56:57,554 --> 00:56:59,852
somewhere, maybe tomorrow morning?

693
00:57:00,791 --> 00:57:02,383
I don't understand.

694
00:57:03,627 --> 00:57:06,494
I feel stupid calling, but...

695
00:57:07,798 --> 00:57:10,892
you're the only person
that I know here.

696
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:12,860
There's no one else.

697
00:57:13,237 --> 00:57:14,829
If you can...

698
00:57:14,905 --> 00:57:17,396
just give me a call, okay?

699
00:57:17,474 --> 00:57:19,170
I have to go now.

700
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:21,070
Good night.

701
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:22,170
Good night.

702
00:57:26,952 --> 00:57:26,985
FRIDAY

703
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:29,579
FRIDAY

704
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:32,782
I mean...

705
00:57:33,692 --> 00:57:35,455
you know this city so well.

706
00:57:36,361 --> 00:57:37,794
You've been here...

707
00:57:37,862 --> 00:57:39,386
so long.

708
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:42,724
It can be a hard place.

709
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:45,860
I don't know why I asked you to come.

710
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:49,598
Why don't you talk to him about it?

711
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:51,703
Tell him how you feel.

712
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:55,878
I can't. You know,
I can't be a burden.

713
00:57:55,947 --> 00:57:57,710
Especially now.

714
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:01,777
I'll get used to things...

715
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:03,047
you know?

716
00:58:03,121 --> 00:58:05,282
I wanted to talk to someone...

717
00:58:05,357 --> 00:58:08,053
who's lived here for a long time.

718
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:13,595
I mean, upstate, it's
a completely different environment.

719
00:58:17,335 --> 00:58:22,034
Did David tell you that I teach
fifth grade? Well, I did.

720
00:58:23,808 --> 00:58:25,571
Yeah, he mentioned it.

721
00:58:28,813 --> 00:58:31,806
I've been going around,
looking at schools...

722
00:58:34,053 --> 00:58:36,146
but the conditions here are...

723
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:37,988
horrible.

724
00:58:39,825 --> 00:58:41,486
What about private schools?

725
00:58:43,896 --> 00:58:44,920
I don't know.

726
00:58:46,899 --> 00:58:49,390
Tell me what's really bothering you.

727
00:58:52,171 --> 00:58:54,605
David and I are going to have a baby.

728
00:58:59,678 --> 00:59:00,838
Oh, Tracy. I...

729
00:59:02,515 --> 00:59:03,948
I don't think I'm the one...

730
00:59:04,617 --> 00:59:05,948
to talk to...

731
00:59:06,018 --> 00:59:08,782
- about this.
- I hate this city.

732
00:59:13,092 --> 00:59:15,117
I had a relationship once...

733
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:18,025
it was very much like a marriage.

734
00:59:20,933 --> 00:59:22,525
We got pregnant.

735
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:25,930
This was a long time ago.

736
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:34,702
I remember getting up one morning
and going to work.

737
00:59:36,782 --> 00:59:41,220
Just a day like any other, except
it was the first day after I knew...

738
00:59:41,888 --> 00:59:42,820
about the pregnancy.

739
00:59:44,791 --> 00:59:47,157
And I felt this fear...

740
00:59:47,727 --> 00:59:49,558
the first time ever.

741
00:59:52,065 --> 00:59:53,498
I remember thinking...

742
00:59:54,267 --> 00:59:57,566
how can I bring a child
into a world like this?

743
00:59:57,637 --> 01:00:00,572
How can a person grow up
with all this around them?

744
01:00:08,248 --> 01:00:10,580
I told her I didn't want to have it.

745
01:00:12,752 --> 01:00:14,720
And over the next few weeks...

746
01:00:15,922 --> 01:00:17,583
I wore her down.

747
01:00:20,427 --> 01:00:22,361
I want to have children.

748
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,025
I can tell you now that...

749
01:00:29,936 --> 01:00:32,268
I know... I mean...

750
01:00:34,174 --> 01:00:36,108
I'm positive that...

751
01:00:36,176 --> 01:00:38,872
I made the right decision.

752
01:00:38,945 --> 01:00:42,108
But not a day passes
that I don't wish...

753
01:00:42,182 --> 01:00:44,878
that I had made a different choice.

754
01:00:48,522 --> 01:00:49,955
If you don't...

755
01:00:50,023 --> 01:00:51,115
keep...

756
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:55,623
the baby, I mean,
if that's your decision...

757
01:00:57,698 --> 01:01:00,292
don't ever tell him you were pregnant.

758
01:01:01,869 --> 01:01:04,963
but if you choose to have the baby...

759
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,130
then spoil that kid...

760
01:01:07,208 --> 01:01:08,971
every chance you get.

761
01:01:15,883 --> 01:01:16,941
That's...

762
01:01:17,018 --> 01:01:18,144
about...

763
01:01:18,219 --> 01:01:20,585
all the advice I can give you, Tracy.

764
01:01:27,728 --> 01:01:28,660
I must go.

765
01:01:29,664 --> 01:01:30,926
William.

766
01:01:38,005 --> 01:01:39,336
Thank you.

767
01:01:44,169 --> 01:01:48,503
Gluttony Greed Sloth Envy
Wrath Pride Lust

768
01:01:53,011 --> 01:01:57,278
Victor's landlord said there was cash
in the mail box...

769
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:59,011
the first of every month.

770
01:02:03,757 --> 01:02:04,781
Quote:

771
01:02:05,258 --> 01:02:08,159
"l never heard a single complaint
from the tenant...

772
01:02:08,228 --> 01:02:11,857
in apartment 306, and nobody
ever complained about him.

773
01:02:11,931 --> 01:02:14,024
The best tenant I've ever had."

774
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:16,466
- End quote.
- A landlord's dream.

775
01:02:16,536 --> 01:02:18,504
A paralyzed tenant with no tongue.

776
01:02:18,571 --> 01:02:20,232
Who pays the rent on time.

777
01:02:21,107 --> 01:02:23,041
I'm sick of this waiting.

778
01:02:23,109 --> 01:02:24,269
This is the job.

779
01:02:25,612 --> 01:02:27,204
Why aren't we out there?

780
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:30,875
Why must we sit here rotting,
waiting till the lunatic...

781
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:32,383
does it again?

782
01:02:32,452 --> 01:02:35,546
"Lunatic" is dismissive.
Don't make that mistake.

783
01:02:35,622 --> 01:02:38,318
Come on, he's insane. Look.

784
01:02:38,391 --> 01:02:42,555
Right now he's probably dancing around
in his grandma's panties.

785
01:02:42,629 --> 01:02:44,995
Yeah, rubbing himself
in peanut butter.

786
01:02:45,932 --> 01:02:46,990
How's that?

787
01:02:47,066 --> 01:02:48,397
I don't think so.

788
01:02:49,636 --> 01:02:51,831
His luck'll run out.

789
01:02:52,806 --> 01:02:54,831
He's not depending on luck.

790
01:02:57,911 --> 01:03:02,177
We walked in there exactly 1 year
after he tied Victor to the bed.

791
01:03:02,248 --> 01:03:04,011
One year to the day.

792
01:03:04,083 --> 01:03:06,347
- He wanted us to.
- Don't know that for sure.

793
01:03:06,419 --> 01:03:07,853
Oh, yes, we do.

794
01:03:08,989 --> 01:03:10,684
This note he left...

795
01:03:11,091 --> 01:03:13,025
his first words to us.

796
01:03:13,093 --> 01:03:15,789
"Long is the way, and Hard,
that out of hell...

797
01:03:15,863 --> 01:03:17,194
Ieads up to Light."

798
01:03:19,333 --> 01:03:20,925
Fuck him. So what?

799
01:03:21,001 --> 01:03:22,366
He's right, so far.

800
01:03:22,937 --> 01:03:27,431
Imagine the will it takes to keep
a man bound for a full year.

801
01:03:27,508 --> 01:03:29,942
To sever his hand and to use it...

802
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:31,534
to plant fingerprints.

803
01:03:31,612 --> 01:03:34,513
To insert tubes into his genitals.

804
01:03:34,582 --> 01:03:37,551
This guy's methodical, exacting...

805
01:03:37,618 --> 01:03:39,882
and worst of all, patient.

806
01:03:39,954 --> 01:03:41,888
He's a nutbag.

807
01:03:41,956 --> 01:03:45,892
Because the fucker's got
a library card doesn't make him Yoda.

808
01:03:50,364 --> 01:03:51,558
You got money?

809
01:03:52,032 --> 01:03:53,966
I got 50. Fifty bucks.

810
01:03:54,034 --> 01:03:56,468
I propose a field trip. Come on.

811
01:04:00,307 --> 01:04:03,140
We'll make a list.
At the top we'll put "Purgatory"...

812
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:07,146
"Canterbury Tales," anything relating
to the 7 deadly sins.

813
01:04:07,214 --> 01:04:08,647
- Ask yourself.
- Wait.

814
01:04:08,716 --> 01:04:11,742
What would he study
to do the things he's done?

815
01:04:11,819 --> 01:04:13,480
What are his interests now?

816
01:04:14,388 --> 01:04:16,083
Jack the Ripper, for instance.

817
01:04:16,490 --> 01:04:18,152
- Where are we going?
- Library.

818
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:35,275
Coupons. Coupons.
Free coupons. Discount--

819
01:04:35,343 --> 01:04:36,833
Discount coupons.

820
01:04:37,746 --> 01:04:42,445
They must have had about 50 health
violations during the last inspection.

821
01:04:42,517 --> 01:04:45,611
Sit across from me?
I don't want people thinking...

822
01:04:45,687 --> 01:04:46,813
we're dating.

823
01:04:47,455 --> 01:04:48,945
Give me your money.

824
01:04:50,258 --> 01:04:54,718
I'll give you this, but
I ought to know what are we doing.

825
01:04:59,601 --> 01:05:01,296
Somerset. How you doing?

826
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:04,295
Didn't expect a menage-a-trois.

827
01:05:04,372 --> 01:05:06,806
It's not a problem. Sit down.

828
01:05:12,113 --> 01:05:15,310
Only for you do I do this,
so it's a big risk.

829
01:05:15,383 --> 01:05:18,614
- So we're in this fair and square.
- It's a deal.

830
01:05:24,059 --> 01:05:25,321
About an hour.

831
01:05:27,629 --> 01:05:29,325
Yep. Help yourself.

832
01:05:31,901 --> 01:05:33,664
That was money well spent.

833
01:05:34,971 --> 01:05:35,995
Yeah.

834
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:45,345
Alright.

835
01:05:45,414 --> 01:05:49,180
Telling you this, I'm trusting you
more than I trust most people.

836
01:05:49,251 --> 01:05:51,583
Good, 'cause I might punch you.

837
01:05:53,322 --> 01:05:57,258
It's probably nothing, but even so,
it's no skin off our teeth.

838
01:06:00,296 --> 01:06:03,322
The guy in the pizza parlor
is a friend from the Bureau.

839
01:06:05,167 --> 01:06:06,429
Who, stinky man?

840
01:06:07,169 --> 01:06:12,038
For years, the FBl's been hooked into
the library system, keeping records.

841
01:06:12,108 --> 01:06:15,942
- Assessing fines?
- No, monitoring reading habits.

842
01:06:16,012 --> 01:06:17,377
Look.

843
01:06:17,446 --> 01:06:19,380
Certain books are flagged.

844
01:06:19,448 --> 01:06:21,780
Books on, say, nuclear weapons...

845
01:06:22,184 --> 01:06:23,879
"Mein Kampf".

846
01:06:24,353 --> 01:06:29,222
Anyone who checks out a flagged book
has his library records fed to the FBl.

847
01:06:29,291 --> 01:06:31,555
Wait. How is this legal?

848
01:06:31,627 --> 01:06:34,425
Legal. Illegal.
These terms don't apply.

849
01:06:35,898 --> 01:06:39,891
You can't use the information
directly. It's just a useful guide.

850
01:06:40,302 --> 01:06:44,967
It might sound silly, but you can't
get a library card without an ID...

851
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:47,237
and a current phone bill. See?

852
01:06:48,979 --> 01:06:50,947
- So they run our list.
- Precisely.

853
01:06:51,715 --> 01:06:53,979
If you want to know who's reading...

854
01:06:54,051 --> 01:06:57,578
"Purgatory", "Paradise Lost"
and "Helter Skelter"...

855
01:06:57,654 --> 01:07:00,145
the FBl's computers will tell us.

856
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:01,747
It could give us a name.

857
01:07:01,825 --> 01:07:04,919
Of a college kid writing
a term paper...

858
01:07:04,995 --> 01:07:06,587
on 20th-century crime.

859
01:07:07,230 --> 01:07:09,596
At least you're out of the office.

860
01:07:09,666 --> 01:07:11,099
Get a haircut.

861
01:07:12,002 --> 01:07:13,435
How do you know this?

862
01:07:13,503 --> 01:07:14,333
I don't.

863
01:07:15,005 --> 01:07:17,269
- Neither do you.
- Exactly.

864
01:07:25,348 --> 01:07:27,680
"Divine Comedy".

865
01:07:27,751 --> 01:07:31,949
"History of Catholicism" A book
called "Murderers and Madmen".

866
01:07:32,022 --> 01:07:35,514
"Modern Homicide lnvestigation".
"ln Cold Blood".

867
01:07:36,093 --> 01:07:38,186
"Of Human Bondage". Bondage?

868
01:07:38,261 --> 01:07:40,195
It's not what you think.

869
01:07:40,697 --> 01:07:42,688
The Marquis de Sade.

870
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,963
- Marquis de Sade.
- Whatever.

871
01:07:45,035 --> 01:07:47,629
Works of St. Thomas Aqua something...

872
01:07:47,704 --> 01:07:49,797
Saint Thomas Aquinas. There.

873
01:07:49,873 --> 01:07:52,240
He wrote about the seven deadly sins.

874
01:07:52,910 --> 01:07:54,309
Is that it?

875
01:07:54,378 --> 01:07:55,208
Yep.

876
01:07:56,214 --> 01:07:58,580
- Let's try it.
- Jonathan Doe?

877
01:07:59,183 --> 01:08:00,411
Whatever.

878
01:08:00,485 --> 01:08:03,215
We're sure about that name, are we?

879
01:08:03,287 --> 01:08:05,653
You were, you saw it. John Doe.

880
01:08:06,124 --> 01:08:08,149
You want to go back, I'll go back.

881
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:10,992
Let's take a look at him.
Talk to him.

882
01:08:11,696 --> 01:08:13,323
This is crazy.

883
01:08:13,397 --> 01:08:15,490
We'll just talk to him.

884
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:19,326
"Excuse me, sir. Do you
happen to be a serial killer?"

885
01:08:22,907 --> 01:08:24,340
You do the talking.

886
01:08:25,443 --> 01:08:28,003
Put that silver tongue of yours
to work.

887
01:08:28,079 --> 01:08:29,740
You've talked to my wife?

888
01:08:33,751 --> 01:08:35,013
Retarded.

889
01:08:35,419 --> 01:08:37,410
Charlie's fucking Angels.

890
01:08:38,089 --> 01:08:39,920
A name off a computer.

891
01:08:43,928 --> 01:08:45,020
Mills.

892
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:57,703
- You hit?
- No.

893
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:02,780
He's going down!

894
01:09:19,364 --> 01:09:20,888
Fifth floor!

895
01:09:41,053 --> 01:09:43,487
Police. Is there a back way out?

896
01:09:44,089 --> 01:09:45,317
Lock your door.

897
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:50,424
Get out of the fucking hall, please.

898
01:10:16,155 --> 01:10:17,281
Get down!

899
01:10:19,492 --> 01:10:20,891
Get the fuck down.

900
01:11:57,925 --> 01:11:59,119
Goddamn it.

901
01:13:01,556 --> 01:13:03,854
Get out of the fucking way. Clear.

902
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:45,725
Where are you going?

903
01:14:45,794 --> 01:14:48,228
- I'm going in.
- No, no. Wait. Wait.

904
01:14:49,632 --> 01:14:51,793
What? He fucking shot at us.

905
01:14:51,867 --> 01:14:53,300
You can't go in.

906
01:14:53,369 --> 01:14:56,236
- We need a warrant.
- We got probable cause. Come on.

907
01:14:56,305 --> 01:14:59,139
Think about it. Think
how did we get here?

908
01:14:59,209 --> 01:15:02,736
- I can't tell anyone about the Bureau.
- Get out of the way.

909
01:15:02,812 --> 01:15:06,578
We have no reason to be here.
Would you listen to me?

910
01:15:06,650 --> 01:15:10,416
- Get off, get the fuck off me.
- Alright, I'm sorry.

911
01:15:10,487 --> 01:15:12,478
Just pay attention a minute?

912
01:15:13,056 --> 01:15:16,423
With a hole like this,
we won't be able to prosecute.

913
01:15:16,493 --> 01:15:19,326
The fucking guy'll walk.
That's what you want?

914
01:15:19,396 --> 01:15:22,422
By the time we clear a warrant...
Fuck that.

915
01:15:22,499 --> 01:15:26,094
We need a reason to knock on
this door.

916
01:15:27,237 --> 01:15:28,670
Think about it.

917
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:31,332
Okay?

918
01:15:34,177 --> 01:15:35,269
Okay, okay.

919
01:15:36,279 --> 01:15:38,770
You're right. I'm all fucked up.

920
01:15:38,848 --> 01:15:40,611
When you're right, you're right.

921
01:15:48,692 --> 01:15:49,556
Well...

922
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:52,451
no point in arguing anymore.

923
01:15:53,863 --> 01:15:55,660
Unless you can fix that..

924
01:15:58,201 --> 01:16:00,135
You stupid son of a ...

925
01:16:08,445 --> 01:16:10,539
How much money we got left?

926
01:16:11,415 --> 01:16:13,007
So, yeah, I noticed...

927
01:16:13,084 --> 01:16:14,449
this guy going out a lot...

928
01:16:14,518 --> 01:16:18,181
when the murders were happening,
so l...

929
01:16:19,323 --> 01:16:21,689
So you called Det. Somerset?

930
01:16:21,759 --> 01:16:23,818
- She called Somerset.
- 'Cause this guy...

931
01:16:23,894 --> 01:16:26,829
was creepy and shit,
and one of the murders...

932
01:16:26,897 --> 01:16:29,491
- happened right over there.
- I told you the rest.

933
01:16:30,234 --> 01:16:31,826
Got everything?

934
01:16:31,902 --> 01:16:33,893
Have her sign. You must sign.

935
01:16:34,972 --> 01:16:35,961
Good.

936
01:16:37,141 --> 01:16:38,403
You did good.

937
01:16:38,743 --> 01:16:41,177
- I did what you said.
- Here.

938
01:16:41,245 --> 01:16:43,236
You get something to eat.

939
01:16:46,984 --> 01:16:48,747
Everybody stay outside.

940
01:17:50,482 --> 01:17:51,574
Victor.

941
01:18:03,061 --> 01:18:05,757
Wild Bill's Leather

942
01:19:44,097 --> 01:19:45,359
Fuck.

943
01:19:54,975 --> 01:19:57,375
LUST

944
01:20:04,852 --> 01:20:05,910
Somerset!

945
01:20:15,195 --> 01:20:17,390
- What?
- We had him.

946
01:20:18,131 --> 01:20:19,792
What are you saying?

947
01:20:19,867 --> 01:20:21,892
The fucking photographer in...

948
01:20:21,969 --> 01:20:23,061
the fucking stairs.

949
01:20:27,975 --> 01:20:29,966
We had him and we let him go.

950
01:20:36,817 --> 01:20:38,580
You're sure this is him?

951
01:20:38,652 --> 01:20:41,143
Yep. Good. Get it out.

952
01:20:41,822 --> 01:20:46,259
No pay stubs. No appointment books.
No addresses. Just this receipt.

953
01:20:46,326 --> 01:20:48,419
- Keep looking!
- Wait, look at this.

954
01:20:48,495 --> 01:20:51,430
This was under the bed.
His only source of funds?

955
01:20:51,498 --> 01:20:54,092
We got his money. I like it.

956
01:20:54,168 --> 01:20:56,602
Wait. You won't believe this.

957
01:20:56,671 --> 01:20:59,469
We haven't found a fingerprint.
Not one.

958
01:20:59,541 --> 01:21:02,408
Right. I don't believe you.
Keep looking.

959
01:21:07,181 --> 01:21:08,773
We could use some more men.

960
01:21:08,850 --> 01:21:10,010
I'm doing my best.

961
01:21:10,852 --> 01:21:14,185
- What're you getting?
- There are 2,000 notebooks here...

962
01:21:14,255 --> 01:21:17,520
and each notebook
contains about 250 pages.

963
01:21:17,592 --> 01:21:19,355
What about the killings?

964
01:21:20,595 --> 01:21:24,964
"What sick ridiculous puppets we are,
what a gross stage we dance on.

965
01:21:25,033 --> 01:21:27,160
What fun, dancing and fucking.

966
01:21:27,235 --> 01:21:30,864
Not a care in the world.
Not knowing that we're nothing.

967
01:21:30,939 --> 01:21:33,305
We are not what was intended."

968
01:21:33,374 --> 01:21:35,308
Wait, there's a lot more.

969
01:21:36,611 --> 01:21:40,274
"On the subway today, a man came up
to start a conversation.

970
01:21:40,949 --> 01:21:44,817
He made small talk, a lonely man
talking about the weather and things.

971
01:21:44,886 --> 01:21:47,047
I tried to be pleasant...

972
01:21:47,121 --> 01:21:50,056
but my head began to hurt
from his banality.

973
01:21:50,124 --> 01:21:52,285
I almost didn't notice...

974
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:54,726
but I suddenly threw up all over him.

975
01:21:55,296 --> 01:21:57,230
He was not pleased...

976
01:21:57,632 --> 01:21:59,657
and I couldn't stop laughing".

977
01:22:01,069 --> 01:22:02,559
No dates.

978
01:22:02,637 --> 01:22:05,732
Placed on the shelves
in no discernible order.

979
01:22:06,809 --> 01:22:08,800
Just his mind poured out on paper.

980
01:22:10,145 --> 01:22:11,840
Looks like a life's work.

981
01:22:11,914 --> 01:22:15,350
With 50 men reading in 24-hour shifts,
it'd still...

982
01:22:15,417 --> 01:22:17,977
- take 2 months.
- I know.

983
01:22:25,761 --> 01:22:28,093
Phone? Phone? Phone? Phone?

984
01:22:31,667 --> 01:22:33,259
People, quiet!

985
01:22:49,518 --> 01:22:50,951
I admire you.

986
01:22:52,121 --> 01:22:55,386
I don't know how you found me,
but I was surprised!

987
01:22:56,458 --> 01:22:59,950
I respect you law enforcement
officers more every day.

988
01:23:00,029 --> 01:23:02,623
Well, I appreciate that, John.

989
01:23:02,965 --> 01:23:04,728
- I tell you--
- No, listen:

990
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:09,066
I'll be re-adjusting my schedule
in light of today's setback.

991
01:23:09,138 --> 01:23:14,132
I just had to call and express my
admiration. Sorry I had to hurt...

992
01:23:14,209 --> 01:23:17,145
one of you, but I had
no choice, right?

993
01:23:17,647 --> 01:23:22,414
You'll accept my apology? I'd like to
say more but that'd ruin the surprise.

994
01:23:29,559 --> 01:23:30,651
Got it.

995
01:23:35,398 --> 01:23:36,990
Everybody back to work.

996
01:23:39,335 --> 01:23:40,597
You were right.

997
01:23:41,404 --> 01:23:42,564
He's preaching.

998
01:23:45,008 --> 01:23:47,408
These murders are his sermons to us.

999
01:23:47,477 --> 01:23:50,344
Look, we know him. We know him.
We know him.

1000
01:23:53,516 --> 01:23:54,949
Who's the blonde?

1001
01:23:59,556 --> 01:24:00,853
Looks like a pro.

1002
01:24:01,224 --> 01:24:02,191
Maybe.

1003
01:24:02,692 --> 01:24:04,626
She caught John Doe's eye.

1004
01:24:06,930 --> 01:24:09,524
Wild Bills' Leather

1005
01:24:10,266 --> 01:24:13,861
- He came and collected it last night.
- Last night?

1006
01:24:13,937 --> 01:24:15,632
- Yeah.
- This man?

1007
01:24:15,705 --> 01:24:18,697
John Doe, easy name to remember.
He had a limp.

1008
01:24:18,775 --> 01:24:22,677
- What was this job you did for him?
- I've got a picture.

1009
01:24:22,746 --> 01:24:24,839
One sweet piece, actually.

1010
01:24:24,914 --> 01:24:27,645
I thought he was a performance artist.

1011
01:24:27,718 --> 01:24:29,709
You know the sort of guy that...

1012
01:24:29,787 --> 01:24:32,620
pisses in a cup on stage and then...

1013
01:24:32,690 --> 01:24:34,123
drinks it.

1014
01:24:34,191 --> 01:24:35,249
Performance art.

1015
01:24:35,593 --> 01:24:36,787
Right.

1016
01:24:39,764 --> 01:24:42,062
I think I undercharged him.

1017
01:24:42,133 --> 01:24:44,328
- You made this for him?
- I've made...

1018
01:24:44,401 --> 01:24:46,301
weirder shit than that.

1019
01:24:52,042 --> 01:24:53,532
They found the blonde.

1020
01:24:56,781 --> 01:24:58,214
The picture!

1021
01:24:58,282 --> 01:24:59,681
The picture!

1022
01:25:01,051 --> 01:25:02,780
Fucking pigs.

1023
01:25:04,722 --> 01:25:07,657
- I need you to move.
- I'll come out, but you guys...

1024
01:25:07,725 --> 01:25:10,057
Get the fuck out of the booth.

1025
01:25:10,127 --> 01:25:12,322
I've been in this cage the whole time.

1026
01:25:13,631 --> 01:25:15,064
Come on, this way.

1027
01:25:22,072 --> 01:25:26,168
-Can you do something about the music?
-We're looking for the guy.

1028
01:25:39,257 --> 01:25:42,420
You from homicide?
You better see this.

1029
01:25:52,404 --> 01:25:54,429
Get this thing off me.

1030
01:25:54,506 --> 01:25:56,531
Oh God, get it off of me.

1031
01:25:58,777 --> 01:26:00,210
Get him out of here, now!

1032
01:26:01,746 --> 01:26:03,407
I want to hear it again.

1033
01:26:03,748 --> 01:26:05,079
Tell me again.

1034
01:26:07,485 --> 01:26:10,716
You heard nothing strange,
saw nothing strange.

1035
01:26:14,559 --> 01:26:17,027
He asked me if I was married.

1036
01:26:17,095 --> 01:26:19,586
- I saw a gun in his hand.
- Where was the girl?

1037
01:26:19,664 --> 01:26:21,928
The what? What?

1038
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,594
The prostitute. Where was she?

1039
01:26:24,669 --> 01:26:27,160
Someone comes to your establishment...

1040
01:26:27,239 --> 01:26:31,175
they want to go downstairs,
get some oo-la-la. Whatever.

1041
01:26:31,676 --> 01:26:33,837
They got to come to you. Yeah?

1042
01:26:34,512 --> 01:26:35,501
Yeah.

1043
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:36,911
You didn't see anyone?

1044
01:26:37,749 --> 01:26:41,185
With a package? A knapsack?
Something under their arm?

1045
01:26:41,253 --> 01:26:45,690
Everybody that comes in there's got
to be a package under their arms.

1046
01:26:45,757 --> 01:26:49,284
Some guys are carrying suitcases
full of stuff.

1047
01:26:49,361 --> 01:26:51,353
She was just sitting on the bed.

1048
01:26:58,371 --> 01:27:00,965
Who tied her down? You or him?

1049
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:03,474
Do you like what you do for a living?

1050
01:27:03,542 --> 01:27:05,533
All these things you see?

1051
01:27:05,611 --> 01:27:09,308
No, I don't.

1052
01:27:10,783 --> 01:27:12,876
But that's life, isn't it?

1053
01:27:17,223 --> 01:27:19,316
He had a gun. And...

1054
01:27:19,926 --> 01:27:21,985
he made it happen.

1055
01:27:24,630 --> 01:27:26,825
He made me do it.

1056
01:27:27,133 --> 01:27:29,567
He put that thing on me.

1057
01:27:30,369 --> 01:27:33,065
And he made me wear it.

1058
01:27:33,139 --> 01:27:34,834
Then he...

1059
01:27:34,907 --> 01:27:36,738
told me to fuck her.

1060
01:27:38,577 --> 01:27:40,875
And I did. I fucked her.

1061
01:27:41,580 --> 01:27:43,241
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1062
01:27:43,316 --> 01:27:45,682
Oh, God, he had a gun in my mouth.

1063
01:27:46,419 --> 01:27:49,081
The fucking gun was in my throat.

1064
01:27:49,488 --> 01:27:50,750
Fuck.

1065
01:27:53,592 --> 01:27:55,753
Oh, God. God.

1066
01:27:55,828 --> 01:27:58,695
God, help me.
Please, please, help me.

1067
01:28:17,284 --> 01:28:19,047
This won't have a happy ending.

1068
01:28:20,187 --> 01:28:22,781
- It's not possible.
- We catch him, I'll be happy enough.

1069
01:28:25,859 --> 01:28:29,295
If we catch John Doe and he turns out
to be the devil...

1070
01:28:29,363 --> 01:28:31,354
if he's Satan himself...

1071
01:28:31,431 --> 01:28:33,729
that might meet our expectations.

1072
01:28:34,368 --> 01:28:35,858
But he's not the devil.

1073
01:28:37,304 --> 01:28:38,965
He's just a man.

1074
01:28:39,539 --> 01:28:40,631
You know...

1075
01:28:41,375 --> 01:28:45,141
You bitch and you complain
and you tell me these things.

1076
01:28:45,979 --> 01:28:49,142
If you think you're preparing me
for hard time...

1077
01:28:49,216 --> 01:28:50,240
thanks, but...

1078
01:28:50,817 --> 01:28:53,081
But you got to be a hero.

1079
01:28:54,054 --> 01:28:55,817
You want to be a champion.

1080
01:28:55,889 --> 01:28:58,983
People don't want a champion.
They want cheeseburgers...

1081
01:28:59,059 --> 01:29:02,324
- play lotto and watch TV.
- How did you get like this?

1082
01:29:02,396 --> 01:29:03,829
I want to know.

1083
01:29:08,502 --> 01:29:11,198
It wasn't one thing,
I'll tell you that.

1084
01:29:12,507 --> 01:29:14,134
Go on.

1085
01:29:17,011 --> 01:29:20,344
I don't think I can continue to live
in a place...

1086
01:29:20,415 --> 01:29:24,181
that embraces and nurtures apathy
as if it was a virtue.

1087
01:29:24,252 --> 01:29:26,243
You aren't different or better.

1088
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:29,016
I didn't say I was. I'm not.

1089
01:29:29,090 --> 01:29:32,355
Hell, I sympathize.
I sympathize completely.

1090
01:29:32,427 --> 01:29:34,361
Apathy is a solution.

1091
01:29:34,896 --> 01:29:40,801
I mean, it's easier to lose yourself
in drugs than it is to cope with life.

1092
01:29:40,868 --> 01:29:44,804
It's easier to steal what you want
than to earn it. It's easier...

1093
01:29:44,872 --> 01:29:49,468
to beat a child than to raise it.
Love costs. It takes effort, work.

1094
01:29:49,544 --> 01:29:54,641
We talk about mentally ill people.
We are talking about fucking crazies.

1095
01:29:54,715 --> 01:29:56,307
- No, we're not.
- Yes, today.

1096
01:29:56,384 --> 01:29:59,876
No, we're talking about
everyday life here.

1097
01:29:59,954 --> 01:30:03,219
You can't afford to be this naive.

1098
01:30:03,291 --> 01:30:05,054
Fuck off.

1099
01:30:05,126 --> 01:30:06,650
See, you...

1100
01:30:06,727 --> 01:30:08,661
You should listen to yourself.

1101
01:30:08,729 --> 01:30:10,822
Yeah. You say that...

1102
01:30:10,898 --> 01:30:13,389
the problem is people don't care.

1103
01:30:14,235 --> 01:30:16,328
So, I don't care about people.

1104
01:30:16,404 --> 01:30:18,235
Nonsense. You know why?

1105
01:30:18,306 --> 01:30:19,739
You care?

1106
01:30:19,807 --> 01:30:21,672
Want to know-- Damn right.

1107
01:30:21,742 --> 01:30:23,334
You'll make a difference.

1108
01:30:23,412 --> 01:30:25,903
Whatever. The point is that...

1109
01:30:25,981 --> 01:30:28,916
you're not quitting
because you believe...

1110
01:30:28,984 --> 01:30:30,918
these things you say.

1111
01:30:30,986 --> 01:30:32,681
You want to believe them...

1112
01:30:32,754 --> 01:30:34,187
because you're quitting.

1113
01:30:35,924 --> 01:30:40,861
And you want me to agree with you and
say "You're right, it's all fucked up.

1114
01:30:40,929 --> 01:30:45,093
It's a fucking mess. We should all go
live in a fucking log cabin."

1115
01:30:46,001 --> 01:30:47,434
But I won't.

1116
01:30:48,203 --> 01:30:50,103
I won't say that.

1117
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:53,708
I don't agree with you. I do not.

1118
01:30:57,613 --> 01:30:58,443
I can't.

1119
01:31:08,857 --> 01:31:10,381
I'm going home.

1120
01:31:18,534 --> 01:31:19,728
Thank you, though.

1121
01:31:50,333 --> 01:31:52,164
I love you.

1122
01:31:52,735 --> 01:31:54,259
So much.

1123
01:32:02,412 --> 01:32:03,674
I know.

1124
01:33:03,907 --> 01:33:03,941
SUNDAY

1125
01:33:03,941 --> 01:33:06,171
SUNDAY

1126
01:33:06,243 --> 01:33:08,438
What's your emergency?

1127
01:33:09,580 --> 01:33:11,104
Could you repeat that?

1128
01:33:12,349 --> 01:33:14,010
I've done it again.

1129
01:33:21,025 --> 01:33:23,619
PRIDE

1130
01:33:24,194 --> 01:33:25,627
What have we got?

1131
01:33:25,696 --> 01:33:27,687
Sleeping pills.

1132
01:33:28,866 --> 01:33:30,629
Glued to one hand.

1133
01:33:30,701 --> 01:33:32,191
Telephone glued to the other.

1134
01:33:33,904 --> 01:33:35,166
You see what he did?

1135
01:33:36,106 --> 01:33:37,664
He sliced her up.

1136
01:33:38,042 --> 01:33:39,976
Then he bandaged her.

1137
01:33:40,044 --> 01:33:42,308
Call for help and you'll live.

1138
01:33:42,379 --> 01:33:44,210
But you'll be disfigured.

1139
01:33:46,183 --> 01:33:48,708
Or put yourself out
of your own misery.

1140
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:50,982
Come on.

1141
01:33:51,055 --> 01:33:52,488
He cut off her nose.

1142
01:33:52,556 --> 01:33:54,319
To spite her face.

1143
01:33:54,391 --> 01:33:56,484
And he did it very recently.

1144
01:34:03,968 --> 01:34:05,060
Listen...

1145
01:34:06,071 --> 01:34:09,063
I've decided to stay on
till this is done.

1146
01:34:09,140 --> 01:34:13,008
One of two things'll happen.
Either we'll get John Doe...

1147
01:34:13,078 --> 01:34:16,172
or he'll kill 7 and this case
will never end.

1148
01:34:16,247 --> 01:34:19,580
Don't do me any favors. Thank you,
but I got it.

1149
01:34:19,651 --> 01:34:24,520
I'm asking to be your partner a few
more days. You'd be doing me a favor.

1150
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:37,695
You knew I'd say yes. We're here.

1151
01:34:38,670 --> 01:34:41,867
Your wife called.
Get an answering machine.

1152
01:34:44,676 --> 01:34:45,870
Detective?

1153
01:34:47,512 --> 01:34:49,207
After this I'm gone.

1154
01:34:50,014 --> 01:34:52,744
- No big surprise.
- Detective!

1155
01:34:55,620 --> 01:34:57,110
You're looking for me.

1156
01:34:59,924 --> 01:35:01,016
Don't fucking move.

1157
01:35:01,092 --> 01:35:02,423
On the floor.

1158
01:35:02,494 --> 01:35:04,621
- Stay back.
- On the fucking floor.

1159
01:35:04,696 --> 01:35:05,890
I know you.

1160
01:35:05,964 --> 01:35:07,295
Now. Get down.

1161
01:35:07,866 --> 01:35:09,494
Get down on your stomach.

1162
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:11,001
You piece of shit. Now!

1163
01:35:11,670 --> 01:35:13,433
All the way. All the way...

1164
01:35:13,506 --> 01:35:14,996
fucker. Down.

1165
01:35:15,074 --> 01:35:16,439
Faster.

1166
01:35:16,509 --> 01:35:18,670
Faster, fucker. Now.

1167
01:35:18,744 --> 01:35:20,507
Nose on the ground.

1168
01:35:23,749 --> 01:35:26,843
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is this?

1169
01:35:26,919 --> 01:35:30,082
I'd like to speak
to my lawyer, please.

1170
01:35:31,791 --> 01:35:33,122
Goddamn it.

1171
01:35:35,361 --> 01:35:39,957
He cuts the skin off the tips of his
fingers. That's why we couldn't...

1172
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:42,193
find 1 print in his apartment.

1173
01:35:42,268 --> 01:35:44,532
Seems he's done that for a while.

1174
01:35:44,603 --> 01:35:47,197
What about the bank accounts?
The guns?

1175
01:35:47,273 --> 01:35:49,366
So far everything is a dead end.

1176
01:35:49,442 --> 01:35:52,206
No credit history.
No employment records.

1177
01:35:52,278 --> 01:35:55,475
A 5-year old bank account
opened with cash.

1178
01:35:55,548 --> 01:35:57,880
We've tried tracing his furniture.

1179
01:35:57,950 --> 01:35:59,645
All we know about him...

1180
01:35:59,718 --> 01:36:02,209
is that he's independently wealthy...

1181
01:36:02,788 --> 01:36:04,153
well-educated...

1182
01:36:04,223 --> 01:36:05,656
and totally insane.

1183
01:36:05,724 --> 01:36:08,158
Because he's John Doe by choice.

1184
01:36:08,761 --> 01:36:12,720
- When can we question him?
- You can't. He goes to court now.

1185
01:36:12,798 --> 01:36:16,996
There's no way he'd turn himself in.
It doesn't make any sense.

1186
01:36:17,069 --> 01:36:18,229
There he sits.

1187
01:36:18,304 --> 01:36:20,671
It's not supposed to make any sense.

1188
01:36:20,740 --> 01:36:22,002
He's not finished.

1189
01:36:22,075 --> 01:36:25,169
He's pissing in our faces
and we're taking it.

1190
01:36:25,812 --> 01:36:27,837
You know what I'm saying.

1191
01:36:27,914 --> 01:36:31,907
For the first time ever,
you and I are in total agreement.

1192
01:36:31,985 --> 01:36:33,509
He wouldn't just stop.

1193
01:36:33,587 --> 01:36:35,578
So what the fuck, man?

1194
01:36:35,655 --> 01:36:39,250
He's 2 murders away
from completing his masterpiece.

1195
01:36:40,327 --> 01:36:42,192
We'll wait for his plea.

1196
01:36:45,599 --> 01:36:45,732
My client says there're 2 more bodies.
Two more victims hidden away.

1197
01:36:45,732 --> 01:36:50,260
My client says there're 2 more bodies.
Two more victims hidden away.

1198
01:36:50,337 --> 01:36:55,365
He will take Detectives Mills and
Somerset to these bodies, only them...

1199
01:36:55,442 --> 01:36:57,535
and only at 6 o'clock today.

1200
01:36:57,611 --> 01:36:58,737
Why us?

1201
01:36:59,346 --> 01:37:01,041
He says he admires you.

1202
01:37:02,449 --> 01:37:04,212
It's part of the game.

1203
01:37:04,284 --> 01:37:08,550
If they don't accept this offer,
these bodies will never be found.

1204
01:37:08,622 --> 01:37:11,250
Frankly, I'm inclined to let them rot.

1205
01:37:12,626 --> 01:37:14,059
We've got him.

1206
01:37:14,127 --> 01:37:17,062
Downstairs, locked up. Done deal.

1207
01:37:17,130 --> 01:37:19,621
He'll get his free room and board,
cable TV.

1208
01:37:19,699 --> 01:37:23,726
My wife doesn't even have cable.
Why are we discussing this?

1209
01:37:23,803 --> 01:37:28,137
No. Something stinks. And this one--
You. In your $3,000 suit...

1210
01:37:28,208 --> 01:37:32,578
and that smug smile on your face.
Dealing for that piece of shit.

1211
01:37:32,647 --> 01:37:33,875
I don't like it.

1212
01:37:33,948 --> 01:37:35,882
The law requires me to serve...

1213
01:37:35,950 --> 01:37:39,477
my clients and their interests
as best I can.

1214
01:37:39,554 --> 01:37:41,749
We don't make deals here, Mr. Swarr.

1215
01:37:41,822 --> 01:37:43,312
My client informs you that...

1216
01:37:43,391 --> 01:37:46,087
if you do not accept,
he'll plead insanity.

1217
01:37:46,994 --> 01:37:48,427
Let him try it.

1218
01:37:49,130 --> 01:37:50,324
I'd like to see it.

1219
01:37:50,398 --> 01:37:54,334
We know with the extreme nature
of these crimes I'd get him off...

1220
01:37:54,402 --> 01:37:55,835
with such a plea.

1221
01:37:55,903 --> 01:37:58,463
I won't let this conviction slide.

1222
01:37:58,539 --> 01:38:02,498
If you do accept under
his specific conditions, he'll sign...

1223
01:38:02,577 --> 01:38:05,341
a full confession,
plead guilty right now.

1224
01:38:05,746 --> 01:38:07,976
It's your case.
Make a decision.

1225
01:38:09,584 --> 01:38:11,176
Full confession.

1226
01:38:11,252 --> 01:38:12,446
I'm in.

1227
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:14,351
It must be both of you.

1228
01:38:15,690 --> 01:38:17,954
If he were to claim insanity...

1229
01:38:18,025 --> 01:38:20,858
this conversation is admissible.

1230
01:38:21,262 --> 01:38:23,355
That he's blackmailing us
with his plea.

1231
01:38:23,431 --> 01:38:26,457
My client wants to remind you,
2 more are dead.

1232
01:38:26,534 --> 01:38:30,026
The press'd love to find out
the police weren't concerned...

1233
01:38:30,104 --> 01:38:32,470
about finding and burying them.

1234
01:38:32,540 --> 01:38:34,701
If in fact there are 2 more dead.

1235
01:38:34,775 --> 01:38:36,436
The lab report came.

1236
01:38:36,510 --> 01:38:39,206
They did a quickie on
Doe's clothing and fingernails.

1237
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:42,808
They found blood from Doe's fingers,
blood from...

1238
01:38:42,884 --> 01:38:46,320
the woman who's face he cut off,
and blood from...

1239
01:38:46,388 --> 01:38:47,980
a third party...

1240
01:38:48,056 --> 01:38:49,887
as yet unidentified.

1241
01:38:53,295 --> 01:38:55,661
You'd be escorting an unarmed man.

1242
01:38:58,567 --> 01:39:00,194
Let's finish it.

1243
01:39:03,905 --> 01:39:06,931
If John Doe's head splits open
and a UFO flies out...

1244
01:39:07,009 --> 01:39:09,341
I want you to expect it.

1245
01:39:11,246 --> 01:39:12,508
I will.

1246
01:39:15,317 --> 01:39:20,186
If I accidently shaved off a nipple,
would it be covered by workman's comp?

1247
01:39:24,760 --> 01:39:26,193
I suppose so.

1248
01:39:27,829 --> 01:39:30,696
If you were man enough
to file a claim...

1249
01:39:30,766 --> 01:39:33,564
I'd buy you one out of my own pocket.

1250
01:39:34,603 --> 01:39:37,800
I keep coming home late,
my wife'll think something's up.

1251
01:39:46,848 --> 01:39:47,872
You know...

1252
01:39:49,351 --> 01:39:50,375
Yeah.

1253
01:39:56,459 --> 01:39:57,448
What?

1254
01:41:07,598 --> 01:41:09,361
Will this wind hurt us?

1255
01:41:58,649 --> 01:41:59,877
Who are you, John?

1256
01:42:00,818 --> 01:42:02,251
Who are you really?

1257
01:42:02,820 --> 01:42:04,253
What do you mean?

1258
01:42:04,321 --> 01:42:08,223
At this stage, what harm can it do
to tell us about yourself?

1259
01:42:08,292 --> 01:42:11,921
Doesn't matter who I am.
Who I am means absolutely nothing.

1260
01:42:11,995 --> 01:42:13,826
Stay on your left up here.

1261
01:42:17,836 --> 01:42:19,030
Where are we heading?

1262
01:42:20,271 --> 01:42:21,499
You'll see.

1263
01:42:22,106 --> 01:42:25,371
We're not just going to pick up
2 more bodies, are we?

1264
01:42:26,010 --> 01:42:28,274
That wouldn't be shocking enough.

1265
01:42:28,346 --> 01:42:31,110
You've got newspapers
to think about, yeah?

1266
01:42:32,417 --> 01:42:34,783
Wanting people to listen...

1267
01:42:34,853 --> 01:42:36,115
you can't just...

1268
01:42:36,187 --> 01:42:38,621
tap them on the shoulder anymore.

1269
01:42:38,690 --> 01:42:41,181
You have to use a sledgehammer.

1270
01:42:41,259 --> 01:42:44,194
Then you'll get
their strict attention.

1271
01:42:44,262 --> 01:42:45,854
But the question is:

1272
01:42:46,331 --> 01:42:49,129
Why're you so special
that people should listen?

1273
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:50,690
I'm not special.

1274
01:42:51,703 --> 01:42:53,796
I've never been exceptional.

1275
01:42:54,439 --> 01:42:57,203
This is, though. What I'm doing.

1276
01:42:57,275 --> 01:42:58,435
My work.

1277
01:42:58,509 --> 01:43:00,170
Your work, John?

1278
01:43:00,245 --> 01:43:01,439
Yes.

1279
01:43:01,946 --> 01:43:04,938
See, I don't see anything special
about it, John.

1280
01:43:06,117 --> 01:43:07,516
That's not true.

1281
01:43:07,585 --> 01:43:11,385
No, it is true. And the funny
thing is, all this work...

1282
01:43:11,789 --> 01:43:16,283
in 2 months, no one'll care,
or give a shit, or even remember.

1283
01:43:16,895 --> 01:43:19,386
You can't see the whole complete
act yet.

1284
01:43:20,398 --> 01:43:22,161
But when this is done...

1285
01:43:23,401 --> 01:43:24,868
when it's finished...

1286
01:43:26,472 --> 01:43:28,201
it's going to be...

1287
01:43:31,076 --> 01:43:34,011
People will barely be able
to comprehend.

1288
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:36,744
But they won't be able to deny.

1289
01:43:38,150 --> 01:43:39,845
Could the freak be more vague?

1290
01:43:40,819 --> 01:43:42,480
As far as master plans go...

1291
01:43:43,155 --> 01:43:45,419
I really can't wait for you to see.

1292
01:43:45,491 --> 01:43:47,254
It's going to be something.

1293
01:43:48,260 --> 01:43:51,093
Know what?
I'll be standing next to you.

1294
01:43:51,163 --> 01:43:54,428
So when this thing happens,
be sure and let me know.

1295
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:55,967
Don't want to miss it.

1296
01:43:56,035 --> 01:43:57,696
Oh, don't worry.

1297
01:43:58,103 --> 01:43:59,365
You won't.

1298
01:44:01,273 --> 01:44:03,207
You won't miss a thing.

1299
01:44:29,969 --> 01:44:31,459
What's so exciting?

1300
01:44:32,538 --> 01:44:34,665
It's not too far now.

1301
01:44:41,881 --> 01:44:46,409
I've tried to figure something in my
head. Maybe you can help me out.

1302
01:44:48,188 --> 01:44:52,124
When a person is insane,
as you clearly are, do you know...

1303
01:44:52,559 --> 01:44:54,083
that you're insane?

1304
01:44:54,828 --> 01:44:56,728
Maybe you're reading...

1305
01:44:56,796 --> 01:44:58,923
masturbating in your own feces...

1306
01:44:58,999 --> 01:45:00,990
Do you just stop and go:

1307
01:45:01,067 --> 01:45:04,662
"Wow, it's amazing how fucking crazy
I really am"?

1308
01:45:04,738 --> 01:45:07,434
You know? Do you guys do that?

1309
01:45:07,841 --> 01:45:10,833
It's more comfortable
for you to label me insane.

1310
01:45:10,910 --> 01:45:12,172
It's very comfortable.

1311
01:45:12,846 --> 01:45:16,009
It's not something I would expect
you to accept.

1312
01:45:16,516 --> 01:45:19,610
But I did not choose. I was chosen.

1313
01:45:19,686 --> 01:45:20,846
Whatever.

1314
01:45:20,920 --> 01:45:23,184
I don't doubt that you believe that.

1315
01:45:23,923 --> 01:45:25,948
but it seems that you're...

1316
01:45:26,026 --> 01:45:28,119
overlooking a contradiction.

1317
01:45:28,194 --> 01:45:29,593
Meaning what?

1318
01:45:30,597 --> 01:45:32,189
Glad you asked.

1319
01:45:33,867 --> 01:45:35,630
If you were chosen...

1320
01:45:35,702 --> 01:45:38,136
that is, by a higher...

1321
01:45:38,204 --> 01:45:40,138
power...

1322
01:45:40,206 --> 01:45:42,299
and if your hand was forced...

1323
01:45:42,709 --> 01:45:46,042
it seems strange to me
that you'd get such enjoyment.

1324
01:45:46,446 --> 01:45:48,972
You enjoyed torturing those people.

1325
01:45:50,051 --> 01:45:53,214
That doesn't seem to fit
with martyrdom, does it?

1326
01:45:54,722 --> 01:45:55,882
John?

1327
01:46:00,795 --> 01:46:05,562
I doubt I enjoyed it more than Det.
Mills would enjoy time alone with me...

1328
01:46:05,633 --> 01:46:07,328
in a room without windows.

1329
01:46:08,202 --> 01:46:09,567
Isn't that true?

1330
01:46:10,137 --> 01:46:11,570
How'd you like to...

1331
01:46:11,639 --> 01:46:14,665
- hurt me with impunity?
- That hurts my feelings.

1332
01:46:14,742 --> 01:46:16,505
I would never.

1333
01:46:16,577 --> 01:46:19,341
You wouldn't only because
there's consequences.

1334
01:46:20,481 --> 01:46:23,507
It's in those eyes of yours, though.

1335
01:46:23,584 --> 01:46:26,246
Nothing wrong with a man
taking pleasure in his work.

1336
01:46:26,821 --> 01:46:29,688
I won't deny my own personal desire...

1337
01:46:29,757 --> 01:46:31,918
to turn each sin against
the sinner.

1338
01:46:32,493 --> 01:46:36,190
Wait a minute, I thought all you did
was kill innocent people.

1339
01:46:38,165 --> 01:46:40,861
Innocent? ls that supposed
to be funny?

1340
01:46:41,602 --> 01:46:43,263
An obese man.

1341
01:46:43,337 --> 01:46:45,862
Disgusting man who could barely stand.

1342
01:46:45,940 --> 01:46:50,434
You'd point him out to your friends
so that they'd join you in mocking him.

1343
01:46:50,511 --> 01:46:54,948
If you saw him while you ate,
you couldn't finish your meal.

1344
01:46:55,683 --> 01:46:59,244
Then the lawyer. You had to
secretly thank me for that.

1345
01:46:59,621 --> 01:47:02,715
This is a man who dedicated
his life...

1346
01:47:02,791 --> 01:47:07,558
to making money by lying with every
breath he could muster to keep...

1347
01:47:07,629 --> 01:47:09,563
murderers and rapists...

1348
01:47:09,631 --> 01:47:11,292
- on the streets.
- Murderers?

1349
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:14,430
- Murderers, like yourself?
- A woman...

1350
01:47:14,503 --> 01:47:17,404
so ugly inside that she
couldn't go on living...

1351
01:47:17,472 --> 01:47:19,804
if she couldn't be beautiful outside?

1352
01:47:19,875 --> 01:47:24,244
A drug dealer. A pederast, actually.
Let's not forget...

1353
01:47:24,312 --> 01:47:27,110
the disease-spreading whore.

1354
01:47:29,351 --> 01:47:31,819
Only in a world this shitty...

1355
01:47:31,887 --> 01:47:35,721
could you say they were innocent
and keep a straight face.

1356
01:47:38,727 --> 01:47:40,422
But that's the point.

1357
01:47:41,830 --> 01:47:44,993
We see a deadly sin
on every street corner...

1358
01:47:45,066 --> 01:47:46,590
in every home and we...

1359
01:47:47,068 --> 01:47:48,000
tolerate it.

1360
01:47:48,570 --> 01:47:51,334
We tolerate it because it's common.

1361
01:47:51,406 --> 01:47:52,839
It's trivial.

1362
01:47:53,408 --> 01:47:56,002
We tolerate it morning,
noon and night.

1363
01:47:59,414 --> 01:48:01,109
Well, not anymore.

1364
01:48:03,585 --> 01:48:05,450
I'm setting the example.

1365
01:48:07,022 --> 01:48:08,785
And what I've done will be...

1366
01:48:08,857 --> 01:48:10,188
puzzled over...

1367
01:48:10,693 --> 01:48:12,183
and studied...

1368
01:48:13,362 --> 01:48:14,795
and followed...

1369
01:48:16,599 --> 01:48:17,793
forever.

1370
01:48:18,534 --> 01:48:19,796
Yeah.

1371
01:48:21,037 --> 01:48:22,265
Delusions of grandeur.

1372
01:48:24,373 --> 01:48:26,136
You should be thanking me.

1373
01:48:26,609 --> 01:48:27,974
Why's that, John?

1374
01:48:28,044 --> 01:48:31,207
Because you'll be remembered
after this.

1375
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:35,216
Realize, Detective, the only reason
that I'm here now...

1376
01:48:35,284 --> 01:48:37,377
is that I wanted to be.

1377
01:48:37,453 --> 01:48:40,149
No. We would have got you eventually.

1378
01:48:40,223 --> 01:48:41,656
Oh, really?

1379
01:48:41,724 --> 01:48:45,956
So what were you doing,
biding your time? Toying with me?

1380
01:48:46,462 --> 01:48:49,556
Allowing 5 "innocent" people
to die until...

1381
01:48:49,632 --> 01:48:52,066
you felt like springing your trap?

1382
01:48:52,134 --> 01:48:54,068
What was the indisputable...

1383
01:48:54,136 --> 01:48:57,162
evidence you were going to use on me,
right before...

1384
01:48:57,240 --> 01:49:00,903
I walked up to you and put my hands
in the air?

1385
01:49:00,977 --> 01:49:03,172
John. Calm down.

1386
01:49:03,246 --> 01:49:05,737
I remember us knocking on your door.

1387
01:49:06,649 --> 01:49:08,014
That's right.

1388
01:49:08,084 --> 01:49:11,417
And I seem to remember
breaking your face.

1389
01:49:15,925 --> 01:49:18,485
You're only alive
because I didn't kill you.

1390
01:49:18,561 --> 01:49:20,256
Okay. Sit back.

1391
01:49:20,329 --> 01:49:22,355
- I spared you.
- Sit back.

1392
01:49:22,432 --> 01:49:24,923
Remember that when you
look in the mirror...

1393
01:49:25,002 --> 01:49:27,197
for the rest of your life...

1394
01:49:27,271 --> 01:49:30,763
or should I say for the rest
of what life I allow you...

1395
01:49:30,841 --> 01:49:32,206
to have.

1396
01:49:32,276 --> 01:49:34,210
Sit back, you fucking freak!

1397
01:49:34,278 --> 01:49:35,836
Shut your fucking mouth!

1398
01:49:37,347 --> 01:49:41,784
You're no messiah. You're a movie
of the week. A fucking tee-shirt...

1399
01:49:42,185 --> 01:49:43,709
at best.

1400
01:49:56,967 --> 01:49:59,299
Don't ask me to pity those people.

1401
01:49:59,369 --> 01:50:03,738
I don't mourn them any more than the
1000's that died at Sodom & Gomorrah.

1402
01:50:03,807 --> 01:50:08,403
Is that to say, John, that what
you were doing was God's good work?

1403
01:50:11,648 --> 01:50:14,412
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

1404
01:50:16,653 --> 01:50:19,087
Do you see those high tension towers?

1405
01:50:19,156 --> 01:50:20,987
That's where we're headed.

1406
01:50:21,058 --> 01:50:23,652
I see it. 9 o'clock,
and follow that road.

1407
01:50:37,842 --> 01:50:40,675
There sure as shit is no ambush
out here.

1408
01:50:40,745 --> 01:50:42,838
No fucking nothing out here.

1409
01:50:43,681 --> 01:50:46,844
They'll come up behind us in about
2 minutes.

1410
01:50:46,918 --> 01:50:49,011
I want you to go way up.

1411
01:50:49,087 --> 01:50:52,454
In thirty seconds, bank east
on my mark. Thirty seconds.

1412
01:51:54,420 --> 01:51:55,352
I'll get him.

1413
01:52:02,261 --> 01:52:03,421
Get out.

1414
01:52:04,329 --> 01:52:05,591
Slowly.

1415
01:52:06,331 --> 01:52:07,525
Stop.

1416
01:52:08,333 --> 01:52:09,595
Stay.

1417
01:52:12,771 --> 01:52:14,033
What do you got?

1418
01:52:15,607 --> 01:52:16,869
A dead dog.

1419
01:52:18,610 --> 01:52:20,339
I didn't do that.

1420
01:52:27,019 --> 01:52:28,213
What time is it?

1421
01:52:29,021 --> 01:52:29,885
Why?

1422
01:52:30,289 --> 01:52:31,688
I'd like to know.

1423
01:52:35,027 --> 01:52:36,119
7:01.

1424
01:52:39,364 --> 01:52:40,524
It's close.

1425
01:52:41,467 --> 01:52:42,729
Let's go take a look.

1426
01:52:46,371 --> 01:52:47,565
It's this way.

1427
01:53:36,022 --> 01:53:38,286
Down. Down. Down.

1428
01:53:40,026 --> 01:53:41,186
Watch him.

1429
01:53:42,762 --> 01:53:43,820
There he goes.

1430
01:53:44,931 --> 01:53:47,092
It's good we have
some time to talk.

1431
01:53:53,239 --> 01:53:56,174
The guy in red.
Keep the crosshairs on him.

1432
01:54:03,783 --> 01:54:05,307
A van's coming down the road.

1433
01:54:05,718 --> 01:54:06,811
From the north.

1434
01:54:16,196 --> 01:54:20,155
Be ready for anything.
Wait for my signal. Wait for me.

1435
01:54:25,973 --> 01:54:26,997
Get out!

1436
01:54:29,643 --> 01:54:30,667
Out!

1437
01:54:30,744 --> 01:54:32,905
Jesus Christ, man. Don't shoot.

1438
01:54:32,980 --> 01:54:34,242
Step away.

1439
01:54:34,982 --> 01:54:36,973
Turn around. Hands on your head.

1440
01:54:37,585 --> 01:54:38,813
What's going on?

1441
01:54:39,753 --> 01:54:40,913
Why are you here?

1442
01:54:40,988 --> 01:54:44,924
I'm delivering a package
for this guy, David.

1443
01:54:44,992 --> 01:54:46,357
Detective...

1444
01:54:46,427 --> 01:54:47,689
David Mills.

1445
01:54:54,835 --> 01:54:56,769
Get it. Slowly.

1446
01:55:09,416 --> 01:55:12,112
A guy paid me $500
to bring it out here.

1447
01:55:12,186 --> 01:55:14,381
He wanted it here at exactly
7 o'clock.

1448
01:55:14,955 --> 01:55:16,217
Put it down.

1449
01:55:17,358 --> 01:55:18,724
We got a box.

1450
01:55:18,793 --> 01:55:21,387
We got a box.
Call the bomb squad.

1451
01:55:21,463 --> 01:55:23,090
Bomb squad. We got a box.

1452
01:55:23,164 --> 01:55:24,722
Face the van.

1453
01:55:25,467 --> 01:55:26,627
Hands up.

1454
01:55:34,376 --> 01:55:35,240
Turn.

1455
01:55:36,911 --> 01:55:38,242
Okay. Go.

1456
01:55:38,313 --> 01:55:39,803
Off you go. Go.

1457
01:55:42,017 --> 01:55:44,110
I'm sending the driver out on foot.

1458
01:55:47,756 --> 01:55:49,189
He's headed north, along the road.

1459
01:55:49,257 --> 01:55:50,519
Have him picked up.

1460
01:56:00,201 --> 01:56:01,793
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know.

1461
01:56:08,376 --> 01:56:09,866
I'm going to open it.

1462
01:56:09,944 --> 01:56:13,141
When I said I admired you,
I meant what I said.

1463
01:56:32,601 --> 01:56:33,659
It's blood.

1464
01:56:33,736 --> 01:56:36,330
You've made quite a life for yourself,
Detective.

1465
01:56:36,405 --> 01:56:40,000
- You should be very proud.
- Shut the fuck up, you piece of shit.

1466
01:57:07,670 --> 01:57:09,194
California, stay away from here.

1467
01:57:09,271 --> 01:57:11,865
Stay away from here, now.
Don't, don't, don't come in here.

1468
01:57:11,941 --> 01:57:14,000
Whatever you hear, stay away.

1469
01:57:14,944 --> 01:57:17,037
John Doe has the upper hand.

1470
01:57:18,614 --> 01:57:19,945
Here he comes.

1471
01:57:20,015 --> 01:57:21,949
- Throw your gun down!
- What?

1472
01:57:22,017 --> 01:57:24,212
- I wish I could have lived like you.
- Shut up.

1473
01:57:24,286 --> 01:57:25,480
What the fuck you talkin' about?

1474
01:57:27,022 --> 01:57:28,853
Do you hear me, Detective?

1475
01:57:28,924 --> 01:57:30,585
I'm trying to tell you how much...

1476
01:57:30,659 --> 01:57:33,150
I admire you and your pretty wife.

1477
01:57:34,096 --> 01:57:35,256
What?

1478
01:57:35,331 --> 01:57:36,525
Tracy.

1479
01:57:37,433 --> 01:57:40,028
- What'd you fucking say?
- It's disturbing...

1480
01:57:40,103 --> 01:57:43,038
how easily a member of the press
can purchase...

1481
01:57:43,106 --> 01:57:45,040
information from the men
in your precinct.

1482
01:57:45,108 --> 01:57:46,939
What the fuck?

1483
01:57:47,010 --> 01:57:49,205
Throw your gun down!

1484
01:57:49,279 --> 01:57:51,270
I visited your home this morning...

1485
01:57:52,115 --> 01:57:53,776
after you left.

1486
01:57:54,618 --> 01:57:56,415
I tried to play husband.

1487
01:57:56,953 --> 01:58:00,548
I tried to taste the life
of a simple man.

1488
01:58:00,624 --> 01:58:01,886
Throw it away!

1489
01:58:01,958 --> 01:58:04,119
It didn't work out.

1490
01:58:04,194 --> 01:58:05,957
So...

1491
01:58:06,029 --> 01:58:07,963
I took a souvenir.

1492
01:58:09,633 --> 01:58:11,533
Her pretty head.

1493
01:58:16,373 --> 01:58:18,898
- What's, what's he talking about?
- Give me the gun.

1494
01:58:18,975 --> 01:58:20,237
What's goin' on over there?

1495
01:58:20,310 --> 01:58:22,335
Would you... Put the gun down.

1496
01:58:22,412 --> 01:58:23,811
I saw you with the box.
What was in the box?

1497
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:25,745
Because I envy your normal life.

1498
01:58:25,816 --> 01:58:26,976
Put the gun down, David.

1499
01:58:27,050 --> 01:58:28,915
It seems that envy is my sin.

1500
01:58:28,985 --> 01:58:30,919
- What's in the box?
- Not until you give me the gun.

1501
01:58:30,987 --> 01:58:32,420
What's in the fucking box?

1502
01:58:32,823 --> 01:58:34,484
He just told you.

1503
01:58:34,558 --> 01:58:37,721
You lie! You're a fucking liar!
Shut up!

1504
01:58:38,061 --> 01:58:41,224
That's what he wants. He wan--
He wants you to shoot him.

1505
01:58:45,302 --> 01:58:46,735
No! No. You tell me.
You tell me that's not true.

1506
01:58:46,803 --> 01:58:48,998
- That's not true.
- Become vengeance, David.

1507
01:58:49,072 --> 01:58:50,334
She's all right. You tell me.

1508
01:58:50,407 --> 01:58:51,602
Become...

1509
01:58:51,676 --> 01:58:52,768
wrath.

1510
01:58:52,844 --> 01:58:54,004
Tell me she's all right!

1511
01:58:54,579 --> 01:58:56,103
If you murder a suspect, David...

1512
01:58:57,415 --> 01:58:59,508
you just throw it all away
and he knows it.

1513
01:59:00,151 --> 01:59:02,278
- She begged for her life, Detective.
- Shut up!

1514
01:59:02,353 --> 01:59:04,617
She begged for her life...

1515
01:59:04,689 --> 01:59:06,680
and for the life of the baby
inside of her.

1516
01:59:25,209 --> 01:59:26,540
He didn't know.

1517
01:59:40,391 --> 01:59:42,052
Give me the gun, David.

1518
01:59:50,067 --> 01:59:51,659
If you kill him...

1519
01:59:53,137 --> 01:59:54,502
he will win.

1520
01:59:58,809 --> 02:00:00,674
Oh God!

1521
02:00:00,745 --> 02:00:02,179
Oh God!

1522
02:01:11,650 --> 02:01:13,242
Well, we'll take care of him.

1523
02:01:22,495 --> 02:01:24,258
Whatever he needs.

1524
02:01:25,398 --> 02:01:26,956
Where you gonna be?

1525
02:01:29,669 --> 02:01:30,931
Around.

1526
02:01:35,408 --> 02:01:36,841
I'll be around.

1527
02:01:41,180 --> 02:01:43,512
Ernest Hemingway once wrote:

1528
02:01:43,583 --> 02:01:47,280
The world is a fine place
and worth fighting for."

1529
02:01:48,855 --> 02:01:50,948
I agree with the second part.

1530
02:05:11,949 --> 02:06:44,349
