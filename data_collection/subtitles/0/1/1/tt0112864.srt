1
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,431
Hot town
Summer in the city

2
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,596
Back of my neck
gettin'dirty and gritty

3
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,631
Been down
Isn't it a pity

4
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,955
Doesn't seem to be
a shadow in the city

5
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,877
All around
people looking half-dead

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,117
Walkin'on the sidewalk
hotter than a match head

7
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,390
But at night
it's a different world

8
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,910
Go out and find a girl
Come on, come on and dance all night

9
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,837
Despite the heat
it'll be all right

10
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,916
And, babe
don't you know it's a pity

11
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,996
The days can't be like the nights

12
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,917
In the summer in the city

13
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,349
In the summer in the city

14
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,277
Cool town
Evening in the city

15
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,470
Dressed so fine
and looking so pretty

16
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,431
Cool cat
Looking for a kitty

17
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,630
Gonna look in every corner
of the city

18
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,115
Till I'm wheezing
like a bus stop, runnin'--

19
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,756
Allen, Bomb Squad,
Special Services...

20
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,314
State Police and the FBI!

21
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,069
Lieutenant Jurgenson, Upummer! I want
you to go to St.John's Emergency...

22
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,555
in case we got any walk-ins
from the street.

23
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,114
- Take that down there and get it faxed.
- Kramer, get the city engineer!

24
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,470
I gotta find out a damage report.
It's very important.

25
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,034
Bonwit Teller. Who the hell would want
to blow up a department store?

26
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,991
Did you ever see a woman
miss a shoe sale?

27
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,395
Connie, I want you to get started
on the witness sheet.

28
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,751
Ricky, you and Joe, you make sure
the uniforms got it cordoned off there.

29
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,190
And you don't let
the damn TV crews in. Benson!

30
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,471
- Inspector, phone.
- Not now. Benson! Traffic!

31
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,831
We get Fifth Avenue cleared up by 3:00,
or we got the traffic jam from hell!

32
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,757
- Walter!
- Yeah?

33
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,111
I think you'd better take this.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,116
Major Case Unit,
Inspector Cobb.

35
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,231
Said Simple Simon to the pie man
going to the fair...

36
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,430
''Give me your pies...

37
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,313
or I'll cave your head in. ''

38
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,671
You see, Bonwit's was just
to make sure I had your attention.

39
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,917
Is there a detective
named McClane there?

40
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,716
- He's on suspension.
- No, Walter, he's not. Not today.

41
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,479
- Who is this?
- Call me Simon.

42
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,558
- What do you want?
- I want to play a game.

43
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,478
- What kind of game?
- ''Simon says. ''

44
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,309
Simon's going to tell
Lt McClane what to do...

45
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,591
and Lt McClane is going to do it.

46
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,871
Noncompliance will result
in a penalty.

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,797
What penalty?

48
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,037
Another big bang
in a very public place.

49
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,233
What is it that you want
Lt McClane to do?

50
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,669
Simon says Lt McClane
is to go to the corner...

51
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,439
of 138th Street und Amsterdam...

52
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,630
which is in Harlem
if I'm not mistaken.

53
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,639
Kowalski! Lambert!
Do you know where to find McClane?

54
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,796
Well, I kinda doubt
you're gonna find him in church.

55
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,196
Well, you better find out
what rock he's under...

56
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,719
and kick it over.

57
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,835
-John.
- Thanks.

58
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,796
Gimme some more. Come on.

59
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,192
Jesus,John.
You look like shit.

60
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,829
Where did we leave off
with that roster?

61
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,475
We got three killings in Red Hook
the past two nights.

62
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,716
Put Miner on it.
And Genetti.

63
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,717
The mayor's office will call
before the day's out.

64
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,152
Next, 14 dump trucks stolen
from a yard in Staten Island.

65
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,512
Fourteen!Jesus! Is somebody
starting a construction company?

66
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,074
Nah, it was John's landlady
going to clean his apartment.

67
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,356
Insurance fraud.

68
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,233
That's a priority
out in California.

69
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,316
The contractor splits the money
with the thieves.

70
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,908
We had that out in Jersey
a couple years ago,Joe. Remember?

71
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,271
- See what Kelly can do with it.
- Oh, wow.

72
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,356
Hey, what was the lottery number
last night?

73
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,550
- 4667.
- 4667.

74
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,197
You still bettin' your badge, Rick?

75
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,993
Yeah, 6991every week.

76
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,996
6991, lucky number.

77
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,839
Half the cops in New York
play their badges.

78
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,872
How're the kids,John?

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,639
I hear they're okay.

80
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,035
Did you talk with Holly?

81
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,871
- No, I didn't talk to Holly.
- Coming up on it, Inspector.

82
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,716
Is it hot in here,
or am I just scared to death?

83
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,116
You wanna make sure
the gun's secure?

84
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,231
Yeah, it's good.

85
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,794
You know, you're the first woman
since Holly who's seen me do this.

86
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,152
- I'm honoured.
- Yeah, so was she.

87
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,391
So, where's the backup gonna be?

88
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,438
We're gonna drop back
to 128th Street.

89
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,869
What?

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,753
Ten blocks?
Are you fucking kidding me?

91
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,270
Oh, man, that's just great! Hey, Walter,
what is all this about, huh?

92
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,597
- If we don't do it, this guy says he's
gonna blow up another public place.
- Well, why me?

93
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,998
- What does it got to do with me?
- I have no idea. He just said
it had to be you.

94
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,793
It's nice to be needed.

95
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,196
- Frankly,John, you haven't been--
- Hey, Walter, how 'bout you mind your
fucking business about Holly, huh?

96
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,989
Between you and Simon, you're
fucking up a perfectly good hangover.

97
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,757
Okay.

98
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,273
We'll be back to pick you up
in 15 minutes.

99
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,551
Take your time.
I expect to be dead in four.

100
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,874
Let's go, Billy!

101
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,197
Oh, man.

102
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,838
- Hey, yo, Uncle.
- Come look at this.

103
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,516
It's ten after 9:00.
Why aren't you in school?

104
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:29,077
- Tony wants to sell you this.
- Tony? That no-neck dude
they call Bad T?

105
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,156
He says he found it
in a Dumpster.

106
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,635
He keeps stealing from people,
they're gonna find him in a Dumpster.

107
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,638
No, he didn't steal it.
He says his uncle gave it to him.

108
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,718
Mm-hmm. Hand me
that newspaper over there.

109
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,191
Don't ever let people use you.

110
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,117
You're runnin' all over town
with stolen property.

111
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,037
If you get caught,
you get in trouble...

112
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,390
while he gets to deny
the whole thing and walk away.

113
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,637
You-- You mean you want us
to take it back to Tony?

114
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,991
No, I'll take it back to Tony,
with a message.

115
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,469
- Now, where you goin'?
- School.

116
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,397
- Why?
- To get educated?

117
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,317
- Why?
- So we can go to college.

118
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,590
- And why is that important?
- To get ''espect.''

119
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,597
''Respect.''
And who's the bad guys?

120
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,314
- Guys who sell drugs.
- Guys who have guns.

121
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,237
- And who's the good guys?
- We're the good guys.

122
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,237
- Who's gonna help you?
- Nobody.

123
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,590
- So who's gonna help you?
- We're gonna help ourselves.

124
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,075
- And who do we not want to help us?
- White people.
- White people.

125
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,714
That's right.

126
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,116
Now, get on outta here.
Go to school.

127
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,035
- Uncle, you better come look at this.
- What?

128
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,116
There's a white man
standing in the street.

129
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,913
- I seen one.
- Not like this.

130
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,880
Dial 9-1-1. Tell the police
to get up here quick.

131
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,630
Somebody's about to get killed. And get
your butts to school. You hear me?

132
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,910
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- All right.

133
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,718
- I paid 500 bucks--
- You better back off, man.

134
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,913
- Hey, man!
- He ain't so big.

135
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,790
- Morning.
- Good morning.

136
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,230
You having a nice day, sir?
You feeling all right?

137
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,191
Not to get too personal...

138
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,151
but a white man standin'
in the middle of Harlem...

139
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,589
wearin' a sign that says
''I hate niggers''...

140
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,790
has either got some serious
personal issues...

141
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,354
or not all his dogs are barkin'.

142
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,948
Hey, I'm talkin' to you!

143
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,674
Now, you got about ten seconds
before those guys see you.

144
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,598
When they do, they will kill you.
You understand?

145
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,349
You are about to have
a very bad day.

146
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,995
Tell me about it.
Sir, this is a police matter.

147
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,634
- For your own safety, I'm gonna
ask you to step across the street.
- You damn right it's a police matter!

148
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,558
For your own safety, I suggest
you hide your butt in my shop
till the police get here.

149
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,716
What the fuck?

150
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,840
Aw, shit.

151
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,997
- Listen, I'm a cop. I'm on a case.
- What?

152
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,315
Somebody blew up
Bonwit Teller's an hour ago.
Did you hear about that on the news?

153
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,237
- Yeah.
- The same asshole that did that said...

154
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,157
I gotta come to Harlem and do this
or he's gonna blow up something else.

155
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,077
- Do you understand?
- Shit, shit, shit.

156
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,997
- Listen, I got a gun.
You should get across the street.
- They got ten guns.

157
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,917
- You should get across the street!
- Look, start acting crazy, all right?

158
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,395
- What?
- Like Looney Tunes.
You know, like Bellevue?

159
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,832
- Hey, Zeus, this a friend of yours?
- He look like a friend of mine?

160
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,839
I think the dude just escaped from
some hospital. You know, like Bellevue?

161
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,919
I am the voice of my own god.

162
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,076
And my god did--

163
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,316
I told the librarian that I had a bad
headache, but she didn't believe me.

164
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,193
I really do have a bad headache, though.
I have a very bad headache!

165
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,676
- And my head does not feel--
- Oh, man, shut the fuck--

166
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,711
- Who in the fuck--
- You've made a very bad mistake.
- Kick his ass.

167
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,513
- Put it through his head.
- Bust his head.

168
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,189
Cut this shit off!
Fellas! Fellas!

169
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,551
Nature boy here hates niggers.
Now, what are we gonna do about that?

170
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,274
- Fight him!
- Yo, yo, yo, yo!
Hold up! Hold up! Hold up!

171
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,119
- Oh, shit!
- Yeah!

172
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,356
Get him! Get him!

173
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,313
- Back! Back up!
- Hey, what you trippin' on?

174
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,671
- Back the fuck up! Now!
- Hey, you better quit that, boy!

175
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,270
Come on, man, get up.
Get up! Get outta here!

176
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,676
Stop the c--
Stop the goddam cab!

177
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,995
- Don't shoot!
No, don't shoot me! Don't shoot!
- Don't move that cab! Get up!

178
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,951
- Come on, get up!
- Yo, you sayin' you gonna kill us?

179
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,675
I mean it! I don't want to, but I will!
You know I will! Come on. Drive! Drive!

180
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,360
- Drive! Go! Go! Go! Drive, goddam it!
- Oh! Get the fuck outta here!

181
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,597
Drive! Drive!
Don't stop! Don't stop!

182
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,029
-Just keep driving!
Run the red light! Drive!
- Don't shoot me, man! That's all I got!

183
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,957
- That's all I got.
- Man, put that fuckin' money away!

184
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,877
- Nobody's robbing you, asshole!
- Don't kill me!
- Nobody's gonna kill you!

185
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,797
- Shit!
-Just run all the lights! Drive!

186
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,831
- Oh, man! Damn!
- We got a bus.

187
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,757
- That cut deep?
- How the hell would I know?

188
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,996
Just keep pressure on it.

189
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,395
Oh, fuck!

190
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,990
-Jesus, right? John McClane.
I owe you one.
- Damn right, you owe me!

191
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,953
- You got any idea what those guys
are doin' to my shop right now?
- Chill out,Jesus!

192
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,877
- We'll send a car for--
- ''Chill out''? What the fuck?
Are you tryin' to relate to me?

193
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,195
- Talk like a white man!
- Okay.Jesus, I'm sorry
you got involved, all right?

194
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,356
Why do you keep calling me Jesus?
I look Puerto Rican to you?

195
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,710
- Guy back there
called you Jesus, didn't he?
- He didn't say Jesus!

196
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,832
- He said, ''Hey, Zeus.'' My name is Zeus.
- Zeus?

197
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,838
Yeah, Zeus! As in father of Apollo!
Mount Olympus!

198
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,713
''Don't fuck with me, or I'll shove
a lightning bolt up your ass!''

199
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,832
Zeus! You got a problem with that?

200
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,474
- No, I don't have a problem with that.
- Shit!

201
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,309
- Downtown. Police Plaza.
- Oh-ho! That's just great.

202
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,998
Get a record of all his collars,
recent releases...

203
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,076
and a list of anybody else
he might have looked at sideways.

204
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,395
It's probably as long as your arm,
so I'm gonna need some help with it.

205
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,353
It's textbook megalomania.
It's a pathological state...

206
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,631
in which fantasies of control
or omnipotence predominate.

207
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,230
He wants control over him.
He wants control over his actions,
over his thoughts, even his emotions.

208
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,955
-Sounds like you got
a secret admirer,John.
-Yeah, maybe he'll send me some flowers.

209
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,311
- Everybody knows you like pansies.
- It's not that kind of emotion.

210
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,635
- This guy is ugly.
- How is that?

211
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,433
Nothin' wrong with him
a shower wouldn't cure.

212
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,994
Beer is normally taken
internally,John.

213
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,192
-Just get me some aspirins, will ya?
- Yeah, okay. Hold this here.

214
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,157
This is Fred Schiller,John,
and he's a--

215
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,829
-A shrink. Yeah, I got it.
-Yes. I was saying that we're dealing...

216
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,918
with a megalomaniacal personality
with possible paranoid schizophrenia.

217
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:26,079
Hey, hey, how about we just skip down
to the part where you tell me what
the fuck this has to do with me, huh?

218
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,034
I don't know. I mean,
what I do know is it does have
specifically to do with you.

219
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,391
This guy wants to pound on you
till you crumble.

220
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,317
He wants you to dance
to his tune and then--

221
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,352
Put on a dress and fuck me?

222
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,516
I was going to say kill you.

223
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,393
-Pick up five, goddam it!
-He's sitting on an awful lot of rage...

224
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,796
and it could be manifested physically
if he's stressed.

225
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,070
Somebody he arrested?
Somebody he pissed off?

226
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,873
- That could be one hell of a long list.
- Fuck you,Joe.

227
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,150
See, these people don't like
to work anonymously.

228
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,555
They want you to know
who's doing it to you.

229
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,477
So this name ''Simon''
is probably not an alias.

230
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,875
It's probably ''Simon''
or some variation.

231
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,879
''Simon, Robert E. Busted in '86,
extortion, kidnapping, ten to fifteen.

232
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,390
Did seven years for good behaviour.
Released on a state work-furlough
two months ago.''

233
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,351
- Check it.
- Thanks, Rick.

234
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,756
Bob Simons was a bankrupt businessman
who kidnapped his partner's daughter.

235
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,633
He's a fuckup, not a psycho.
The guy we're lookin' for is nuts.

236
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,513
A nut who knows a lot about bombs.

237
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,279
We found this in a playground.
Professional!

238
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,358
Very cool stuff.
You know, boom!

239
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,234
- You think you should
slam it around like that, Charlie?
- When it's unmixed, you can't hurt it.

240
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,828
This stuff is cutting edge.
It's a binary liquid.

241
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,713
- A what?
- Like epoxy.

242
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,671
Two liquids.

243
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,314
Either one by itself...

244
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,871
you got nothin', but mix 'em--

245
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,397
Ricky.

246
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,868
Charlie, you're gonna be wearing
that shirt up your ass!

247
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,151
- Christ Almighty, Charlie!
- Like I said, very cool stuff.

248
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,589
Now, with a package like this,
you get a warning.

249
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,676
Now, the bomb has to arm itself.

250
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,952
You'll see the red liquid
pump into the clear before it detonates.

251
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,231
- How long before?
- Ten seconds, two minutes.

252
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,157
Could be anything.

253
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,511
But once it's mixed,
be somewhere else.

254
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,437
This stuff has gotta be pretty rare.

255
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,391
We oughta be able to find out
if any of it's missin' somewhere.

256
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,478
I already did. Livermore Labs
theft over the weekend.

257
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,716
He got enough to make
another one,Joe?

258
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,877
- About 2,000 pounds.
- Of that?

259
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,231
Well, the detonating mechanism
could be anything-- radio, electrical.

260
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,669
Hell, you could use a beeper
and phone it in.

261
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,839
- Inspector? Inspector, it's him.
- He's got a double Alberti
feedback loop on it.

262
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,713
- A nasty little trick
I believe once used in Lebanon.
- Charlie. Charlie!

263
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,398
- Charlie, shh!
- What?

264
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,317
Wanna start the trace?

265
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,599
Simon.

266
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,632
He wore the board,
walked the street and survived.

267
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,834
- Where are my pigeons now?
- Pigeons?

268
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,396
I had two pigeons, bright and gay,
fly from me the other day.

269
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,751
Why was it they did go?
You cannot tell. You do not know.

270
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,555
- You mean McClane?
- No, I mean Santa Claus.

271
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:26,158
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Ah, there after all. And your friend?

272
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,748
Carver! Carver! Come on.
We need you in the other room.

273
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,077
- Let's go! Come on!
- They need you. Go.

274
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,953
- Yeah, he's here too.
- And may I speak with him?

275
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,116
Well, is the ebony
Samaritan there now?

276
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,674
- You got a problem with ebony?
- No, no.

277
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,873
My only problem is that I went to some
trouble preparing that game for McClane.

278
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,150
You interfered
with a well-laid plan.

279
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:52,239
Yeah? Well, you can stick your
well-laid plan up your well-laid ass.

280
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,433
That was not smart.
There are lives at stake here!

281
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,950
- Not enough time, Inspector.
- You better hope he calls back.

282
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,513
He will.

283
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,558
Ricky, you wanna tell those people
to shut the hell up out there!

284
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,478
Hey, keep it down here!

285
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,556
Simon, he wasn't speaking
for all of us.

286
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,831
That was unpleasant.
Don't let it happen again.

287
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,032
- So, what's your name, boy?
- Don't call me ''boy.''

288
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,357
I'm sorry.
It was a poor attempt at humour.

289
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,596
I was going to send you home
with a chiding...

290
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,359
- but now I think perhaps
you should join the game.
- We got him!

291
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,436
It's a pay phone in Oslo.

292
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,357
- No, w-wait, they say
it's Juarez, Mexico.
- Norway?

293
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,040
No, wait. No, wait. N-Now
they're saying it's Juarez, Mexico.

294
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,596
Forget it! Australia?
He's scrambling up their system.
They don't know where he is.

295
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,553
Having fun with
the phone company, are we?

296
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,353
Simon says,
McClane and the Samaritan...

297
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,233
will go to the subway station
at 72nd and Broadway.

298
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,511
I will call you in 15 minutes
on the pay phone outside the station.

299
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,189
No police. Failure to answer
will constitute noncompliance.

300
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,675
Do you understand me,John?

301
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,872
Oh, yes, I understand. I understand
that you're a fuckin' wacko...

302
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,036
that likes to play kids games,
that's what I understand.

303
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,957
- Hardly.
- Hardly?

304
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,231
Well, then, who are you?
Somebody I sent up? What'd you do?

305
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,399
Shoplifting? Purse snatching?
Cross dressing? What?

306
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,638
You c-c-couldn't catch me if I stole
your ch-chair with you in it.

307
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,469
My ch-ch-ch-chair with me in it?
Ooh-hoo! That's very exciting.

308
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,354
Let me ask you a question, bonehead.
Why are you trying to k-k-k-kill me?

309
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,438
- John,John, calm yourself.
- Huh? Why don't you come on
down here to Police Plaza...

310
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,391
and we'll figure this out
like a couple of men, huh?

311
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,432
-Just come on down here.
- If killing you was all I wanted...

312
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,949
- Simon, this is Inspector Cobb.
- you'd be dead by now.

313
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,640
I can appreciate your feelings
for McClane...

314
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,320
but believe me,
the jerk isn't worth it.

315
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,635
He's stepped on so many toes
in this department...

316
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,194
by this time next month
he's gonna be a security guard.

317
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,356
His own wife wants
nothing to do with him...

318
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,472
and he's about two steps shy
of becoming a full-blown alcoholic.

319
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,034
One step. One step.

320
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,991
Now listen to me.

321
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,715
You sound like a real smart guy.
What is it that you want?

322
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,831
Are you talking about money?

323
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,599
Well, whatever, whatever.

324
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,234
McClane is a toilet bug.

325
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,670
Now what would it take just to forget
him and live happily ever after?

326
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,631
You know, money is shit to me.

327
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,833
I would not give up McClane
for all the gold in your Fort Knox.

328
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,952
72nd Street subway,
pay phone, 15 minutes.

329
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,957
McClane and the Samaritan.

330
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,594
If you're competent in the least,
you've found the briefcase...

331
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,518
so you know what I mean by penalty.

332
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,390
I wanna thank you for that vote
of confidence, Walter.

333
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,398
Well, I thought it was worth a try.
This guy's a raving maniac.

334
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,034
Well, he-he couldn't be any clearer
if he got it from a case history.

335
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,071
He gave you clues
to his identity.

336
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,998
He spoke German.
He called it ''your Fort Knox.''

337
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,838
And he stammered
when McClane pushed him.

338
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,996
Now, you believe this guy
really can't be bought?

339
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,159
There's no chance. The very mention
of money only enraged him further.

340
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,110
- What's that?
- It's your shield.

341
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,595
- You askin' me to be
a cop again, Walter?
- Ricky, get him his gun, all right?

342
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,429
- You didn't answer my question. Hey!
-Joe, this time they--

343
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,951
- You didn't answer my question, Walter.
- Are you done, Lieutenant?

344
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,551
Now, you two better get going if you're
going to get up to 72nd Street on time.

345
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,148
-Joe, this time they go with backup.
- You got it.

346
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,840
- Come on, you guys!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
I'm not goin' anywhere.

347
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,999
- Simon says you gotta go!
- I'm not jumpin' through hoops
for some psycho!

348
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,634
That's a white man with white problems.
You deal with him.

349
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:41,515
- Call me when he crosses 110th Street.
- Hey! Why'd you save my ass?

350
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,474
I didn't. I stopped a white cop
from gettin' killed in Harlem.

351
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,477
One white cop gets killed today...

352
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,036
tomorrow we got a thousand white cops,
all of 'em with itchy trigger fingers.

353
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:55,392
- Got it?
- Get him back.

354
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,796
- Charlie, where'd you find that bomb?
- Chinatown.

355
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,831
Shit.

356
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,758
Zeus! Yo, partner! Wait up!

357
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,677
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
I ain't your partner.

358
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,315
I ain't your neighbour, your brother
or your friend. I'm your total stranger.

359
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,595
Okay, stranger...

360
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,871
you know where that park is
at 115th Street and St Nicholas?

361
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,789
- Yeah, it's in Harlem.
- Where do you think
we found that bomb?

362
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:28,074
Listen, this guy doesn't care
about skin colour, even if you do.

363
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,869
- What am I doin'?
- Cheer up. Things could be worse.

364
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,150
I was workin'
on a nice, fat suspension...

365
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,236
smokin' cigarettes
and watchin' Captain Kangaroo.

366
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,559
Come on.

367
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,477
Is that the phone?

368
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,150
Okay, they made it to the phone,
but there's a problem.

369
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,191
Well, what do you mean?
How big a problem?

370
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,231
Oh, about 300 pounds.

371
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,351
- And they're probably going to end up
having to get an operation.
- Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am.

372
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,277
- We need this phone
for official police business.
- Do you mind!

373
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,197
- Honey, I'm a cop.
I need the phone right now.
- I'm sorry, but I can no--

374
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,629
Get off the damn phone, lady!
Police business!

375
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,035
- Well, I never!
- I can get used to this.

376
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,720
I'm sure you can find a phone
across the street, ma'am.

377
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,434
Let's get something straight.
I'm the only one here
on official police business.

378
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,120
- Don't ever do that shit again.
- Let's get somethin' else straight.

379
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,390
You need me
a lot more than I need you.

380
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,398
You don't like the way
I do things, fine. I quit.

381
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,317
I don't know.

382
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,155
All right, I need you.

383
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,471
All right, I need you
more than you need me.

384
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,676
- Hello!
- Birds of a feather flock together.
So do pigs and swine.

385
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,712
Rats and mice have their chance,
as will I have mine.

386
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,671
Nice. Rhymes.

387
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,315
- Why was the phone busy?
Who were you calling?
- The Psychic Hotline.

388
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,237
I'd advise you to take this
more seriously.

389
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,157
Look, it's a public phone!
What do you want me to say?

390
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,239
You can simply say
there was a fat woman on it, and it
took you a minute to get her off.!

391
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,076
Now,John, there's a significant
amount of explosive...

392
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,031
in the trash receptacle next to you.

393
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,069
Try to run,
and it goes up now.

394
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,270
Nobody's gonna run, but I got
a hundred people out here!

395
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,995
That's the point.
Now, do I have your attention?

396
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,588
As I was going to St Ives,
I met a man with seven wives.

397
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,234
Every wife had seven sacks.
Every sack had seven cats.

398
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,794
Every cat had seven kittens.
Kittens, cats, sacks and wives.

399
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,117
How many were going to St Ives?
My phone number is 555--

400
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,993
- No, no, no! Wait! I didn't
get all that! Say it again!
- Not a chance.

401
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,157
- My phone number is 555 and the answer.
- But I didn't--

402
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,475
Call me in 30 seconds or die.

403
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,788
- All right,
seven guys with seven wives makes--
- Shut up, McClane. I'm good at this.

404
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,356
- Seven guys with seven wives makes--
- Shut the fuck up, McClane!
He said seven wives with seven sacks.

405
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,869
- Seven times seven is 49.
Now tell me the rest.
- Seven wives?

406
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,070
- Uh, a sack with--
s-seven sacks with seven--
- Weren't you listening?

407
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,111
- Yeah, I was listening.
I didn't hear every fuckin' thing--
- What the heck is wrong with you?

408
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,913
- Well, I-- Besides having
a bad fuckin' hangover, for one thing!
- All right, all right, all right.

409
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,156
Seven wives times seven, 49.
With seven cats.

410
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,316
Seven times 49 is 343, right?

411
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,716
- What, are you asking me or telling me?
- I'm telling you. 343 times seven is--

412
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,753
One, zero, 24. 2,401.
That's what you got, right?

413
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,836
Yeah, that's what I got.
Is that it, 2,401?

414
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,236
- That's it. Dial. 5 5 5-2401.
- 5 5 5-2401.

415
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,478
- No, wait, wait!
It's a trick. It's a trick.
- What? What? What do you mean?

416
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,114
- I forgot about the man.
- What man? Fuck the man!
We got ten seconds left!

417
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,310
He said how many were going
to St Ives, right?

418
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,796
The riddle begins: As I was going to
St Ives, I met a man with seven wives.

419
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,718
- The guy and his wives
aren't goin' anywhere.
- What are they doing?

420
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,354
Sittin' in the fuckin' road
waitin' on a mo--
How the hell should I know, McClane?

421
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,790
- Well, who's going to St Ives then?
- The guy.Just the guy.

422
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,831
-Just one guy? Just one guy.
- The answer's one.

423
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,474
- How do you dial one?
- 5 5 5-0001.

424
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,319
- Zero, zero, one.Just one guy's going?
- Hello,John.

425
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,715
Yeah, piece of cake.
Give us somethin' harder next time.

426
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,400
- But you're ten seconds late.
- No, no! The answer is one! The--

427
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,034
- Boom.!
- There's a bomb in the trash! Get down!
- Everybody, get down!

428
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,232
Get down! There's a bomb!
Everybody, get down!

429
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,715
There's a bomb!

430
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,308
Get down! There's a bomb!

431
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,430
- Welcome to New York.
- Really.

432
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,716
They were just talking.
Here, you can have it. Come on.

433
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,035
- Come on, let's go.
- I'm getting outta here right now.

434
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,592
- I told you it wasn't a bomb.
- I thought there was a bomb!

435
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,591
No bomb.

436
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,556
- Yeah.
- I didn't say ''Simon says. ''

437
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:41,231
It's 9.:50,John.
The number 3 train is arriving now.

438
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,591
I left something provocative
on that train,John.

439
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,950
Simon says,
get to the pay phone...

440
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,231
next to the news kiosk
in Wall Street Station by 10.:20...

441
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,477
- Half an hour.
- or the number 3 train
and its passengers vaporize.

442
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,990
Use any means of travel
other than civilian, I blow the train.

443
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,588
Attempt to evacuate the subway,
I blow the train.

444
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,439
I'll call you in 30 minutes.
Be there.

445
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,958
- We're fucked.
- Ninety blocks in 30 minutes?

446
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,516
In New York traffic?
It could be double that.

447
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,234
We don't even have a car!

448
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,316
Hey! Hey! Sir! Sir!
I'm a cop! I'm a cop!

449
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,874
- I am requisitioning this car
for official police business.
- Hey, what are you doing?

450
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,468
- Thank you very much. Get in! Get in!
- What the fuck you doing to my car?
- Pretty slick.

451
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,876
Listen, I used to drive a cab.
The fastest way south is--

452
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,434
What the fuck are you doing?

453
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:34,113
- What were you sayin'?
- I was saying I used to drive a cab.

454
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,153
Ninth Avenue is the fastest way south.
But we seem to be going east.

455
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,998
Where the hell are you going, McClane?
I told you Ninth Avenue
was the quickest way south!

456
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,669
- Stop with that goddam yelling!
I know what I'm doing!
- Not even God knows what you're doing!

457
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,360
They're headed east on 72nd
towards the park.

458
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,597
- But Wall Street is south!
- Man, stop yelling at me!
I got a bad headache!

459
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,996
And the best way south is not
Ninth Avenue, it's through the park.

460
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,755
Oh, dear.

461
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,916
I told you the park drive
is always jammed.

462
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,600
I didn't say park drive.

463
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,237
I said through the park.

464
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,559
Shit! We lost 'em.
They're in the park headed south.

465
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,270
- Get outta here!
- Fucking prick!

466
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,871
I got him, Connie.
He's taking the scenic route.

467
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,355
- Outta the way!
- Oh, man.

468
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,836
Get out! Get outta there!

469
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,837
Watch it, watch it, watch it,
watch it! Oh, my God!

470
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,757
Are you-- Are you aiming
for these people?

471
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,235
No. Well, maybe that mime.

472
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,432
Whoa! Tree! Tree! Tree! Oh!

473
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:58,155
- Whoa!
- What's goin' on here?

474
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,430
Look out! Whoa!

475
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,632
- Tree! Tree!
-Just hang on.

476
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,354
Rock! Rock! Rock!

477
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,993
Whoa!

478
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,351
Hey, look out down there!

479
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,109
McClane! McClane, watch it.

480
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,078
McClane!

481
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,515
Come on! Outta the way!

482
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,108
- How do Catholics do their thing?
- North, south, west, east.

483
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,911
- How much time?
- Twenty-seven minutes.

484
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,396
Ha! 72nd and Broadway
to Central Park South in three minutes!

485
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,796
That's gotta be a fuckin' record.

486
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,514
Come on, get out--

487
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,279
Yeah. Now what?

488
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,790
- We need a fire truck.
- What?

489
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,717
To follow.

490
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,315
- 9-1-1.
- Lt John McClane, NYPD.

491
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,273
Access number 7 4 79.
Calling from a civilian transmitter.

492
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,551
- Get me an emergency
dispatcher right away.
- Dispatch. Go ahead.

493
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,035
I got two officers down at the corner
of 14th Street and Ninth Avenue!

494
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,276
Need an ambulance! Over!

495
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,392
Emergency calls on the west side
go to Roosevelt Hospital.
That's two blocks from here.

496
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,758
- Slow the fuck down, McClane!
- Kinda like football, isn't it?

497
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,031
- What?
- Get yourself a blocker
and head for the end zone!

498
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,235
If you'd said Wall Street,
we could've followed him all the way.

499
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,510
Wrong! South of 14th Street's
a different hospital!

500
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,473
- Oh.
- St Luke's. Hang on.

501
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,358
- Time?
- 10:02.

502
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,789
We're halfway there
with 18 minutes to go.

503
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,797
Fuck this! Hang on.

504
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,750
Hang on. Get outta there!
Slide over and take the wheel.

505
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,950
- Where you goin'?
- We should be ahead
of that train, right?

506
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,152
- You're not gonna get on that train--
- I'm gonna get on that train! You gotta
get to that pay phone by 10:20!

507
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,077
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna get that bomb.

508
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,873
Listen, you fail, I cover your ass.
I fail, you cover my ass.

509
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,310
- And if we both fail?
- Then we're both fucked.

510
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,910
Go now! Drive! Get to that
phone booth by 10:20! Go!

511
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,474
My lucky fuckin' day.

512
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,194
Shit! Look out, ma'am!

513
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,029
Look out! Look out! Look out!
Get outta the way!

514
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,354
This is a bad idea!

515
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,752
Oh!

516
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,675
Whoa!

517
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,438
- Excuse me! Excuse me!
- Hey!

518
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,518
Just get outta the way, please!

519
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,713
- 112 Wall Street.
- Wait. This isn't a taxi.
You don't understand.

520
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,070
Your light's on.
I'll make it simple.

521
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,397
112 Wall Street, or I'll have
your medallion suspended.

522
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,557
What, you don't like
white people?

523
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:17,117
112 Wall Street?
You got it.

524
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,677
Come on.

525
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,472
Fuck!
Move your legs, sir.

526
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,068
Get your legs outta the way!
Sorry. Sorry.

527
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,193
- Hey! Excuse me!
- 1823405--

528
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,717
Hey!

529
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,028
Shit!

530
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,390
Excuse me! Watch out!
Excuse me, sir.

531
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,590
Pardon me, please. Excu--

532
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,717
- Will you step outta here for a minute.
- What?

533
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,071
I'm a cop. Step out of here
for a minute, please. Will ya?

534
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,029
Excuse me, please!
Let me get through here, please!

535
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:58,153
- It's him.
- Excuse me. Excuse me, please. Pardon.

536
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,238
Excuse me, sir, but I'm expecting
a call. I need that phone.

537
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,920
Why don't you use
the other phone?

538
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,276
Sir, please.
I need to use that phone.

539
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,039
Hey, listen, bro,
I was here first.

540
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,869
''Bro''? Get away
from the goddam phone!

541
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,560
Put your hands up!

542
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,634
- I have to answer that phone.
-Just shut up and get 'em in the air!

543
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,196
Watch it! Excuse me! Pardon me!
Watch, watch your back! Watch it!

544
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,515
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm a New York police officer.

545
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:49,519
I'm gonna ask you to calmly
and quietly start moving towards
the other end of the car.

546
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,598
Go now, please! Go now!

547
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,632
Fuck! Let's go!
Watch it! Watch out!

548
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,320
Watch-- Watch it! Go!

549
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,356
I have to answer that phone.

550
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,710
Get 'em up!

551
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,991
Look, if you have to shoot me...

552
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,032
then you go ahead
and you shoot me!

553
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:17,517
But I have to answer this phone,
all right?

554
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:26,275
- I'm here.
- And McClane?

555
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,551
He's on his way. Uh, you know, he's
a little slow. He's kinda out of shape.

556
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,151
The rules applied to both of you.
I'm afraid this is noncompliance.

557
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,111
Goodbye.

558
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:46,958
Trust me, guys. Duck.

559
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,919
Hey, get outta there!
Get outta there! Duck, asshole!

560
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,837
Oh, my God!

561
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,799
McClane?

562
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,759
What?

563
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,436
-You can see right down into the subway.
-How many fire trucks do you count?

564
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,358
- You guys! You guys!
- How can you see it from up here?

565
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,877
Damn! Get in there.

566
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,709
Officer, tell those people
to get the hell back, will ya?

567
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,274
We got a shitload of cuts and bruises,
a couple concussions...

568
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,994
some old guy's pacemaker stopped,
and a pregnant girl's water broke.

569
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,190
And that's all.
How're you doin',John?

570
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,436
Still can't hear too good.

571
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,552
Well, it's a miracle you're still alive.
It's a goddam miracle.

572
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,910
- Yeah, that's the problem,Joe.
- What?

573
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,715
The miracle part. What are the odds
of us makin' it down here on time?

574
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,070
- Zip.
- That bomb was gonna go off
no matter what.

575
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,350
He wanted it to go off
right down here.

576
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,869
Take this off me, Dave.

577
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,195
Well, what's so special
about this place?

578
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,880
- I don't know.
Something just doesn't add up.
- Lt McClane?

579
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,594
-Huh?
-They're asking for you and a Mr Carver.

580
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,919
- Where?
-John?

581
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,793
John, this is Andy Cross
with the FBI.

582
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,879
- This is MrJarvis. He's, uh--
- I'm, uh, with another agency.

583
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,673
- It's good to meet you.
- This is Lt McClane.

584
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,598
This is Mr Carver.

585
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,280
Uh, we've got
a couple of questions first.

586
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,595
Do you recognize this guy?

587
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,877
- No.
- How about this one?

588
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,275
- Mm-mm.
- How about you?

589
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,309
Did you recognize
the voice on the phone?

590
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,237
No.

591
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,999
Did you, uh, notice
any cars following you?

592
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,708
- No.
- Anybody following you at all?

593
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,354
Any kind of surveillance?
Telephone? House?

594
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,392
Anything unusual at all?

595
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:18,911
Well, now that you mention it,
I have experienced a--

596
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,429
you know, like a burning sensation
between my toes.

597
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,677
I thought it was just some athlete's
foot or something. I don't know.

598
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:31,359
We read your jacket, Lieutenant.
We were told you would be cooperative.

599
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,277
- Cooperate with what?
What do you mean cooperate?
- Hey, now wait a minute. He will be.

600
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,914
- We're wasting time
here in this goddam van.
- You wanna share information...

601
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,837
how about sending
a little our way as well?

602
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,110
- Look, we wanna hear
what he knows first.
- What the hell?

603
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,800
- You give us pictures, and then you--
- Look, we want to hear
what he knows first.

604
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,195
Hey, I know as much as you know.
All right?

605
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,908
There's a guy out there
settin' off bombs.

606
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,555
He calls himself Simon.
He speaks with a German accent.

607
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,478
And, for some reason,
he's very angry with me.

608
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,239
Now, maybe you can tell me
why, fellas. Huh?

609
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:07,114
The first man there is Methias Targo.
Was Hungarian army.

610
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,879
Explosives expert. Now we believe
he's working for the Iranians.

611
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,834
- Working?
- Freelance terrorism, by contract.

612
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,117
- Who's the girl?
- Targo's other half.

613
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,629
Rumour is the Israelis slipped a bomb
in between their sheets.

614
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,355
Uh, he wasn't at home,
but they think maybe they got her.

615
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:27,598
The second man was an obscure colonel
in the East German army.

616
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,918
He ran an infiltration unit.
The kind of thing the Nazis did
at the Battle of the Bulge.

617
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,952
- English-speaking troops--
- Yeah, yeah, I saw the movie.

618
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:40,995
All we know of him is the G.D.R. medical
records show he suffers from migraines.

619
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,873
His name is Peter Krieg.

620
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,556
Well, that is
an exceptional report, fellas.

621
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,114
Now do you wanna tell me
what the hell this has to do with me?

622
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,800
The name Gruber mean anything
to you, Lieutenant?

623
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,675
- It rings a bell, yeah.
- LA.

624
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,678
- What?
- That thing in the building in LA.

625
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,960
Peter Krieg was born...

626
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,152
Simon Peter Gruber.

627
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,317
He's Hans Gruber's brother.

628
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:25,119
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah, it's that thing in LA.

629
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,198
We figure he's got you
fitted up for a toe tag...

630
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,153
and he's gonna do anything
to get it tied.

631
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,999
Inspector!
Inspector, it's him!

632
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,795
Don't let him know we're here.

633
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,713
- Simon.
- Inspector.

634
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,593
Now, who from the FBI
is in the van, I wonder?

635
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,756
Let's see.
Almost certainly Cross.

636
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,474
- Come on, Andrew. Say hello.
- Hello.

637
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,797
And I know you never run alone,
so say hello, Bill.

638
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,037
Still trying to butch up
by chewing on your glasses, huh?

639
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:04,556
This, gentlemen, as they say,
is where the plot thickens.

640
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,750
I have put 2,400 pounds of explosive...

641
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,997
in one of the 1,446 schools
in greater New York.

642
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:14,318
It is fitted with a timer
set to explode at exactly 3.:00 pm.

643
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:18,109
Thank you.
Your silence says I'm understood.

644
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,834
Did you say 2,400 pounds?

645
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,791
Yes, but please
don't interrupt again.

646
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,514
Simon says, if you attempt
to evacuate schools...

647
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,596
the bomb will be detonated
by radio.

648
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,790
And, gentlemen,
someone will be watching.

649
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,799
Repeat, one school will be dismissed
at 3.:00 pm, permanently.

650
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,558
- Unless--
- Unless what?

651
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,389
Unless John McClane and his new best
friend complete the tasks I set them.

652
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,511
John, are you listening?

653
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,513
Yeah.

654
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,393
The pay phone beyond Hope,
Tomkins Square Park.

655
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,193
Twenty minutes.
Go by foot. No rush.

656
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:54,279
If you're really clever,
you'll learn the location of the bomb
and the code to disarm it.

657
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,277
Oh, and by the way, gentlemen...

658
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,278
we got something of a bargain
on radio detonators.

659
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,675
The only problem is
the darn things seem to respond...

660
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,791
to police and FBI frequencies.

661
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,071
So, if I were you,
I'd keep off your radios.

662
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,997
Simon, wait.

663
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,878
Twenty-four hundred pounds
of that liquid stuff.

664
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,151
My God.
Get me the commissioner.

665
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,999
He's doing a press conference. He's
supposed to be here in half an hour.

666
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:25,192
All right, Ricky, get
every senior officer on the site
and get 'em here right away.

667
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,470
You're not gonna give me
any jurisdictional nonsense on this?

668
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,989
I got two kids
in the school on 64th Street.

669
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,356
- What can I do to help you?
- How many men have you got?

670
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,711
Seventy-five. But if I push the panic
button, I can get 500 from Washington.

671
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,956
- When?
- 2:30, 3:00.

672
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,275
Between now and then--

673
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,234
We're gonna have to do this
all by ourselves. Let's go.

674
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,557
And Tomkins Square Park
is more than two miles away,
so you guys better get running.

675
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,671
No radios.
You take my telephone.

676
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,156
You get anything, you call me
through the switchboard. Good luck.

677
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,317
Thanks.
Find that bomb.

678
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,271
- Ricky, where are they?
- Right over here.

679
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,039
- The senior man present is Chief Allen.
- Chief of what?

680
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,310
- Transit.
- Okay, thanks, Ricky.

681
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,238
Gentlemen, we have a decision to make.
Chief Allen.

682
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,828
The man who has done this
has told us that he has planted...

683
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:14,556
another very large bomb in a school
here in the New York area.

684
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:18,912
And he has told us that we cannot
evacuate, but he has not said
that we cannot search.

685
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,838
Now, I recommend we get everybody,
and I mean everybody--

686
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,155
I'm talking about police,
transit, sanitation, fire...

687
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,077
even the goddam librarians--

688
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,715
and we start searching schools,
and I mean right now.

689
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,434
I'm talking about a thousand buildings
within the city limits...

690
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,949
and we have three hours
and 15 minutes to do it in.

691
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,753
Now, I'd like to keep the media
out of this as long as possible...

692
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,678
because if they get in,
we've got a panic.

693
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,597
Are we in agreement?

694
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,678
Come on, guys. Let's go!

695
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:50,954
Move it out.! Move it out.!
No radio contact. No radio contact.

696
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,836
They bought it.
You can begin.

697
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,429
Hook, line...

698
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,351
and sinker.

699
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,668
All right now, men.
Let's go! Let's go!

700
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,919
Let's go!

701
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,719
- Hey, hold on. Let me go over there.
- I gotta get through!

702
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,231
Sergeant Turley!
Sergeant Turley!

703
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,318
In the last five minutes, the volume
of calls in here has tripled!

704
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,069
- What the hell is goin' on?
- Stop. Let me explain.

705
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,351
For the rest of the day,
we're supposed to handle
the department's communications.

706
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,391
What do you mean ''handle''?

707
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,354
They're shutting down the police band.
All calls will be coming
through this switchboard.

708
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,550
And I'm gonna marry Donald Trump!

709
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,912
Walsh, what's going on?
Why'd everybody tear out of here?

710
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:35,715
Come on, Pamela. Look at your watch!
It's comin' up on shift change.

711
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,671
The bean counters are worried
about overtime...

712
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,030
so we sent everybody back
to the precinct to punch out.

713
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,755
- The next shift
is gonna be here in a minute.
- You are so full of shit, Walsh!

714
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,677
Thank you.

715
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,597
What the hell?

716
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,114
Hey! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

717
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,677
Detective, Bob Thompson,
city engineer's office.

718
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,480
We'd like to get an idea
of the damage.

719
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,237
Man, you guys really
got here fast.

720
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:23,989
Well, it's Wall Street, sir.

721
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,156
A lot of money here.

722
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:30,831
A lot of opinion makers the mayor
doesn't wanna piss off, you know?

723
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,237
Is this it?

724
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,513
Holy Toledo!

725
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,473
Somebody had fun.

726
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:46,513
I'd appreciate it if you'd show
my associates the way down.

727
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,960
Yeah. Yeah, sure.Jimmy!

728
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:54,868
You got the flashlight?
Murphy, come on, you too!

729
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,195
- Rick Walsh.
-John Gunther.

730
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,436
Come on, gentlemen. Let's go!

731
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,678
You were probably at the World Trades.
You know what that mess was.

732
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,715
Please inform Mr Little
that Mr Vanderfloog is here.

733
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,637
Mr Vanderfloog?

734
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,390
There's a Mr Vanderfloog
for Mr Little.

735
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:04,396
Go down 20 metres! Come on!

736
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:07,353
- A lot of steam down here.
- Yeah, yeah. We snapped
a couple of the steam pipes.

737
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:11,234
It's like a sauna. We got the subway
guys to shut down the third rail.

738
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:14,636
- It's on emergency lighting.
- Yeah, emergency lights, and
there's still some light-- Hey!

739
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,353
No shooting!
Speak English!

740
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,789
Otto doesn't speak English,
do you, Otto?

741
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,798
- Where the hell did we get this guy?
- He's one of Targo's thugs.

742
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,114
Pull all the way up!
Pull all the way! Pull all the way!

743
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,348
So what's up with this LA thing?
You famous or somethin'?

744
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,596
Yeah, for about five minutes.

745
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,188
- Don't tell me. Rodney King, right?
- Fuck you.

746
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,515
- You know this guy Simon
we're talking to?
- Yeah.

747
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:49,394
I threw his little brother off the 3 2nd
floor of Nakatomi Towers out in LA.

748
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,997
I guess he's a little
pissed off about it.

749
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,997
Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me I'm in this shit...

750
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:57,032
'cause some white cop threw some
white asshole's brother off a roof?

751
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,275
Mr Vanderfloog?
Felix Little, corporate relations.

752
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,551
Sorry you had to wait, but apparently
there was an explosion in the subway.

753
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,511
It's played hell
with our alarms, I'm afraid.

754
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:52,394
-I trust there's nothing wrong.
-Oh, no. Good Lord, no. Safe and secure.

755
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:55,432
Now, you were concerned
about a currency exchange?

756
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:58,552
W-We are not a commercial bank,
in the normal sense.

757
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,194
We're-- We're primarily, uh...

758
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:04,312
governments, central banks,
that sort of thing.

759
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,556
- Apart from the depository, of course.
- Of course.

760
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:10,070
Yeah. And you are in the flower
business, Mr Vanderfloog?

761
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,756
Back! Back! Come on!

762
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,473
Come on!

763
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:57,192
Oh, no, Mr Vanderfloog,
that's the vault elevator.

764
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:01,591
I'm sorry. Our alarms
are sonic and seismic...

765
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,188
two things which, I'm afraid,
do not react well to explosions.

766
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:08,154
You know, th-this subway business
has knocked all our systems
into a cocked hat.

767
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,999
In fact, we've had to give up
and pull the plug on the whole thing.

768
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,793
- The repair people are downstairs now.
- Good Lord!

769
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,230
Yes, yes. Heavens to Betsy!
If anyone knew!

770
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:24,557
But I thought this was
a currency exchange.

771
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:27,911
Oh, I think we'll go straight
to the withdrawal.

772
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,715
Hey, Captain, you wanna come down here
and take a look at this?

773
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:19,070
Somethin's going on.

774
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,077
What do you think, guys?
You'll be able to fix that?

775
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,997
Just a minute now.

776
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:28,710
Okay, I'll be right back. Down!

777
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,596
Stay back!

778
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,314
Stay back!

779
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,755
Come on. Come on. Shit.

780
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,039
- Come on.
- Front desk.

781
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,833
Yes. Call the police. Get your ass
down here right now! I'm under attack!

782
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:28,872
Hey,just relax, mate.
Maybe you'll live through this.

783
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,797
Shit!

784
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,872
I think he's dead, my dear.

785
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,795
All right.
Let's see to the office work.

786
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,469
God! It's Fort Knox!

787
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:45,237
$140 billion.

788
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,351
Ten times what's in Kentucky.

789
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:51,318
Fort Knox. Ha!
It's for tourists.

790
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,956
Yeah. McClane.

791
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:10,470
John,you're out of shape?
You barely made it.

792
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:14,036
Yeah, well, we all barely make it.
What do you want us to do?

793
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,879
What has four legs
and is always ready to travel?

794
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,390
- Huh? What?
- What did he say?

795
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,511
What has four legs
and is always ready to travel?

796
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,155
What's the matter with you? Don't you
have kids? That's an elephant joke.

797
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,835
Whoa.

798
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,996
That a bomb?

799
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:38,873
- Yeah. Go, go ahead and grab it.
- No. You're the cop.

800
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,594
- Man, Simon said you're supposed to be
helpin' with this.
- I'm helpin'.

801
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,678
- Well, when're you gonna start helpin'?
- After you get the bomb.

802
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,909
- Careful.
- I'm being careful.

803
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,871
- Don't open it.
- What?

804
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,719
I gotta open it.
Uh, it's gonna be all right.

805
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:24,309
Shit! Shit!
I told you not to open it!

806
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,876
I trust you see the message.

807
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,151
It has a proximity circuit,
so, please, don't run.

808
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:37,352
Yeah, I got it. We're not gonna run.
How do we turn this thing off?

809
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:40,597
On the fountain there should be
two jugs. Do you see them?

810
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,075
A five-gallon and a three-gallon.

811
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,909
Fill one of the jugs
with exactly four gallons of water...

812
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:50,350
and place it on the scale
and the timer will stop.

813
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:54,837
You must be precise. One ounce more
or less will result in detonation.

814
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,837
If you're still alive in five minutes,
we'll speak then.

815
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,791
Wait! Wait a sec--

816
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,356
- I don't get it. Do you get it?
- No.

817
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,277
Get the jugs.

818
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:12,952
Obviously, we can't fill
the three-gallon jug with
four gallons of water, right?

819
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:15,594
- Obviously.
- All right. I know. Here we go.

820
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,473
- We fill the three-gallon jug
exactly to the top, right?
- Uh-huh.

821
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:21,672
Okay. Now, we pour that three gallons
into the five-gallon jug...

822
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:24,394
giving us exactly three gallons
in the five-gallon jug, right?

823
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:28,399
- Right. Then what?
- Okay. Now, take the three-gallon jug,
fill that a third of the way up--

824
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,829
- No, no, no. He said be precise.
Exactly four gallons.
- Shit!

825
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,555
Every cop in 50 miles is runnin'
his ass off, and I'm out here
playin' kids games in a park.

826
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,318
Hey!

827
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,954
You wanna focus
on the problem at hand?

828
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,074
I thought you said you knew! You said
don't say anything if you don't know!

829
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,997
I thought you said-- Gimme the fuckin'
jug. We're startin' over.

830
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,951
- No! We can't start over!
We can't start over!
- Pour that out! We're startin' over!

831
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:03,640
-We can't start over.
-Gimme the fuckin' jug, or I'm gonna put
my foot up your ass, you dumb mother--

832
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:06,320
- Say it! Say it!
- What?

833
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:08,237
- You were gonna call me
a nigger, weren't you?
- No, I wasn't!

834
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:10,794
- Yes, you were.
What were you gonna call me?
- Asshole!

835
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,478
How's that, asshole?

836
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:14,511
You got some fuckin' problem
with me 'cause I'm white, Zeus?

837
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:18,315
Is that it? Huh? Have I oppressed you?
Have I oppressed your people somehow?

838
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:21,193
I'll tell you what your problem is. You
don't like me 'cause you're a racist!

839
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,470
- What?
- You're a racist.
You don't like me 'cause I'm white.

840
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,319
I don't like you
because you're gonna get me killed!

841
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,237
How much time?
Aw, shit!

842
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,316
We got less than a minute.
Throw this thing away.

843
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:32,271
No, we can't take it off of there.
It'll detonate.Just, wait.

844
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,630
Wait a second. Wait a second.

845
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,150
I got it! I got it!
Exactly two gallons in here, right?

846
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:40,635
- Right.
- Leaving exactly one gallon
of empty space, right?

847
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,637
- Yeah.
- A full five gallons here, right?

848
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:45,069
- Right.
- If you pour one gallon out of the five
gallons into there we have exactly--

849
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,272
- Four gallons in there!
- Yes!
- Pour it in there! Come on!

850
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,391
Come on!

851
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,715
Don't spill. Don't spill it!

852
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:55,593
-Good, good, good! Exactly four gallons.
-You did it, McClane.

853
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:58,473
- Put it on the thing!
Get it down there!
- Oh, shit.

854
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:09,271
Congratulations.
You're still alive.

855
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,356
- Huh?
- Congratulations.

856
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:14,836
- Yeah, we did it.
- You surprise me again,John.

857
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,871
This is becoming an ugly habit.

858
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,912
Yeah, well, I don't have the time
right now, Simon. Listen.

859
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:22,315
Deal's a deal.
Where's the school bomb?

860
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:25,352
On the contrary,
you have lots of time.

861
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:27,471
You have...

862
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,478
two hours and 4 7 minutes precisely.

863
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,989
Plenty of time
to test those wits of yours.

864
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:35,236
Hey.! Hey.! Hey, listen,jerk-off.!

865
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:37,999
Let me tell you somethin'!
I got a bad fuckin' hangover, all right?

866
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,714
And I'm a little sick of these fuckin'
riddles! Now, where is the school bomb?

867
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:45,152
Temper,John.
The road to truth has many turns.

868
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,590
You will find an envelope
under the rim of the fountain.

869
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:52,793
When you undertake the trip it suggests,
ask yourself this question:

870
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:56,435
What is 21out of 42?

871
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,835
We're behind.
We should abandon the rest and go.

872
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,952
Relax, Targo.
There's not a cop for 20 blocks.

873
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:08,358
He's sending us to the home team dugout
at Yankee Stadium. Why?

874
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,789
Well, we're the home team. Are we
supposed to find something there?

875
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:12,717
What's 21out of 42?

876
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:16,071
Twenty-one again.
Half of 42. Forty-two what?

877
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:19,078
- How many players
are on the Yankees ball club?
- Twenty-five.

878
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,636
- What else is 21? Blackjack.
- It's a club.

879
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:25,115
It's a wild goose chase,
is what it is.

880
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:31,116
Where's the nearest ''A'' train?

881
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:33,037
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

882
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,276
You know,
some kid might find that.

883
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:38,637
You're right.

884
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:46,315
Come back here!
You little sons of bitches!

885
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:49,000
Hey, you! I remember you!

886
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,277
Hey, hey, hey. Where're you going?
Come here. What are you doin'?

887
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,595
- What are you doin'?
- Let me go! Let me go, dick-head.

888
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,119
Watch your mouth.

889
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:59,357
You wanna go down to juvenile hall
for a Butterfinger? Is that it?

890
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:02,153
Look around, man.
All the cops are into somethin'.

891
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,236
It's Christmas.
You could steal City Hall.

892
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,998
- Come on. Let's go. Come on.
- My bike.

893
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:15,350
- Yo, that's my bike!
- Yeah. It's Christmas.

894
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:19,519
- Hey, hey, hey! Where're you going?
Yankee Stadium's that way!
- That's my bike, you asshole!

895
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:28,718
Why don't you just run over everybody
in the whole street?

896
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:31,229
McClane, what the fuck
are we doin' back down here?

897
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,999
Let me ask you somethin'. What is it
that Wall Street doesn't have?

898
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:35,917
What, is this stuff catchin'?
You're talkin' in riddles.

899
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:38,474
- No, no. Stay with me. What is it
that Wall Street does not have?
- What?

900
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:41,672
Schools. And what is it
they have a shitload of?

901
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,756
What?

902
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:53,991
- I'll be back in a minute.
- What am I supposed to do with this?

903
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,397
Give it to those guys over there.

904
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:58,669
He's here.

905
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,756
Perhaps you could be
a little more specific.

906
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:04,873
McClane is here.
He's walking toward the bank.

907
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:08,394
And the black man
is coming toward me.

908
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:11,273
Oh, now that's a pity.

909
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,755
And after we've gone to all
that trouble at the stadium.

910
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:15,916
Simon, kill him.

911
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:18,508
Stop toying with him
and kill him now.

912
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:21,670
Okay. So be it.

913
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:26,635
May he rest in peace.
I'll inform Karl in the lobby.

914
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:29,513
- You pack up your team
and get out of there.
- And this one?

915
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,397
Officer.

916
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,114
Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm afraid
I'm gonna need an answer on that issue.

917
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:45,716
- Let him go.
- Understood. Yes, sir?

918
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:48,400
John McClane says to give you this.

919
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:52,394
Wait, wait.Jesus, don't open it.
It's a bomb.

920
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:53,999
- Another?
- Yeah.

921
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:56,839
Oh, I see. Um, oh,
we'll take care of that.

922
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:59,269
We better move now. Sir,
thank you so much for your assistance.

923
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,675
We really appreciate it.
Thank you.

924
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:07,478
What are you doing?

925
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:13,677
- I don't want to ride with it.
- Some kid could...

926
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,756
Put it in the back.

927
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:24,515
Hey! Y-You, you, uh,
leavin' this place unguarded?

928
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:34,992
I understand.

929
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:47,034
- How ya doin'?
- All right.

930
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:49,674
John McClane. NYPD.

931
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:54,316
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. It's laundry day.

932
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:57,436
What can I do for you, Lieutenant?

933
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,915
Has it been quiet like this
all morning here?

934
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:03,271
- Well--
- Except for that big explosion
a couple of hours ago.

935
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:06,358
I mean, have you seen anything strange
happen in the last hour or so?

936
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:09,677
No. And we've had cops in here
pretty steady since the subway thing.

937
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:11,438
Yeah.

938
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:14,279
We were just gonna make a round on
the vault floor, if you wanna tag along.

939
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,868
Sure. Yeah. I think I will.

940
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,195
Now, what do you think of this heat
this late in the year?

941
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,912
Eh, Indian summer, huh?

942
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:24,271
Yeah, it feels like it's gonna rain
like dogs and cats later.

943
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:28,552
- Here's one of your guys.
- Detective, uh, Otto, isn't it?

944
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:30,477
John McClane.

945
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,797
Hey, Mike. How ya doin'?

946
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,589
I keep tellin' myself I'm gonna
take the stairs just for the exercise.

947
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,676
And on a hot day like this.

948
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:45,553
But it seems like I always end up
riding the lift.

949
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:13,516
Hey, what was the lottery number
last night?

950
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:16,757
Huh? Any of you guys
play the lottery? No?

951
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,758
Ah, my wife buys me two tickets
every week.

952
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:21,836
For the last ten years,
plays the same two numbers all the time.

953
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:23,791
I said, ''Honey, why don't you play
a different number?''

954
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:26,309
She goes,
''Well, those are my lucky numbers.''

955
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,556
I got the tickets right here.

956
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:34,075
Put that fuckin' gun down!
Put that fuckin' gun down now!

957
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:42,317
Put it down!

958
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:49,551
Hello!

959
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,716
Anybody down here?

960
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:03,591
- Put your hands up!
Put your fuckin' hands up now!
- No, no, no!

961
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:06,154
John, no!
No! God, it's me! It's me!

962
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,119
-Jesus Christ,
you almost gave me a heart attack.
- You all right?

963
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:12,639
- Huh?
- You all right?

964
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,876
- Yeah, yeah. It's not my blood.
- What the hell's goin' on down here?

965
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,797
Go take a look in there.

966
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,549
Hey, McClane.
Where the hell is everybody?

967
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:44,557
Simon fuckin' says!

968
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:49,033
I should've seen it comin' a mile away.
This was never about revenge.

969
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:52,197
- It's about a goddam heist.
- Wh-Wh-What was in the room?

970
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:55,710
- This.
- What is this?

971
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:58,149
- Oh, shit! Is this gold?
- Yeah, it's gold.

972
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:01,113
Damn, this is heavy!
They cleaned out a whole room of this?

973
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:05,233
- Yeah.
- You know, that would've taken
like a, a, a, a tank, or a, or a, a--

974
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:07,510
A dump truck.

975
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:09,676
Fourteen great big dump trucks.

976
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:11,916
- We almost got hit by a dump truck.
- Shit!

977
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:14,554
- Damn. Slow down! Shit!
- Put that shit down.

978
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:16,636
- No fuckin' way.
- They ain't gonna let you keep it.

979
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,876
- Yeah, yeah, we'll see.
- We're gonna need a car.

980
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,592
A car?

981
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:28,950
- You know how to hot-wire this thing?
- Of course I can. I'm an electrician.

982
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:30,877
Only problem is...

983
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:36,471
takes too fuckin' long.

984
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:51,908
- Not on the bridge!
- Down there, McClane. The FDR.

985
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:56,877
Let's go, let's go. Come on!

986
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:00,714
- Oh, shit!
- What?

987
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:03,274
- They shot the phone.
- Oh, too bad.

988
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:05,994
- Come on. What's 21out of 42?
- I don't have a clue.

989
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:09,829
- Well, what about Yankee stadium?
- We'll get there, but that son of
a bitch is not gettin' off of Manhattan.

990
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:11,757
- Move!
-Jesus Christ!

991
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:13,359
Who do you think you are, lady,
Hillary Clinton?

992
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:15,152
- That's it! Hillary Clinton.
- What?

993
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:17,840
- The 42nd president.
- No. She'd be the 43rd president.

994
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:21,999
- All right, all right.
But who's the 21st?
- I don't know.

995
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:23,917
- You don't know?
- No, I don't know! Do you know?

996
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:25,996
- No!
- Well?

997
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:28,156
What kind of engine does this piece
of shit have? Come on, step on it!

998
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:31,352
It's a Yugo. It's built
for economy, not speed.

999
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:35,989
- Whoa! What are you doin'?
- I'm gonna get us another phone.

1000
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:41,515
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait, wait, wait!

1001
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:44,837
- Hey, who was the 21st president?
- Go fuck yourself!

1002
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:50,469
- That guy was pissed.
- He'll feel better
when he looks in the back seat.

1003
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,556
Oh, shit.
That was my gold bar!

1004
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:55,148
This is McClane.
Get me Inspector Walter Cobb.

1005
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:58,477
-John, where the hell are you?
- Walter, it's not a revenge.
It's a heist.

1006
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:01,990
- What?
- There's gold in the Federal Reserve,
and they took a shitload of it.

1007
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:05,510
- They're headed north in dump trucks.
- Have you been drinking, McClane?

1008
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:07,437
No, not since this morning.

1009
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:10,313
Listen. There's a line of dump trucks
northbound on the FDR at about 70th.

1010
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:12,954
You gotta close the bridge and get some
helicopters over there right away.

1011
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:15,196
I couldn't close a hot dog stand
right now.

1012
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:18,118
I'm spread all over hell.
What about this damn bomb?

1013
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:20,708
Find out who the 21st president was.
It's got somethin' to do with this.

1014
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:22,512
John!John, the 21st what?

1015
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:26,474
Walter! Shit!
Goddam cellular fuckin' phones!

1016
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,397
- Get hold of Munson in Triborough.
- Inspector.

1017
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:31,398
Tell him to close all the East River
bridges north of 59th Street.

1018
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,397
- Lookin' for dump trucks.
- Dump trucks?

1019
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:37,229
McClane says there are dump trucks
headed up the FDR loaded with gold.

1020
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:40,477
Walter, they don't allow
dump trucks on the FDR!

1021
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,670
- Connie!
- All right.
You don't want I should argue.

1022
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,109
I won't argue,
no matter how stupid it is.

1023
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:48,073
K-9, bring it around to the back.
Check out the boiler room.

1024
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:49,952
Find anything, Charlie?

1025
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:53,152
I could spend a week in here with
an X-ray machine and still not find it.

1026
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:56,431
You don't have a week, Charlie.
You got five more minutes. Then
we're movin' up to 86th Street.

1027
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:58,790
We're goin' as fast as we can.

1028
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:00,399
What's up?

1029
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:03,876
McClane was mentioning something
about the Federal Reserve Building.

1030
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,436
- Isn't that right near that Wall Street
bomb site we just left?
- Yeah.

1031
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:15,596
How long do you want us
to stay here?

1032
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:18,154
The men at the stadium.
Stay or go?

1033
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:20,430
Karl should have checked in by now.

1034
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:22,596
Moment.

1035
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:31,311
Come on. Come on.

1036
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:35,797
Stay where you are.
McClane may still turn up.

1037
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:40,395
Relax, Targo.
If he is still alive...

1038
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:42,829
he won't be talking to anyone.

1039
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,279
It's the next turn-off.

1040
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:47,756
Hi. It's Elvis Duran.
You're on the air. What's up?

1041
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:50,792
First of all, I just wanna tell you
what a great show you got.

1042
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:53,673
- I listen to you all the time.
- Thank you. Thank you.
What do you wanna talk about?

1043
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:56,792
Well,you know all those cop cars
screamin'around everywhere?

1044
01:11:56,920 --> 01:12:00,151
You know what they're up to?
There's a bomb in a school.

1045
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:02,430
- My cousin's a cop.
- Here you go, my dear.

1046
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,869
Somebody put a big bomb
in a school somewhere.

1047
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,275
- Seven. Five.
- Only they don't know which one.

1048
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:09,356
- 207--
- So they're searching all of them.

1049
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:12,392
- Shh. Shh.
- Every school in the metropolitan area.

1050
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:14,636
Holy shit.

1051
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:16,079
- Doris!
- Annie?

1052
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:17,269
Doris, can you get ahold
of my wife?

1053
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:22,518
Turley! Half the goddam city
just called 9-1-1!

1054
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:26,832
- They're gone.
- What?

1055
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:29,030
- They're gone!
- Who is this guy, Houdini?

1056
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:31,276
Shit! Down there! Down there!

1057
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,549
-This thing got air bags?
-Your side does. I don't know about my--

1058
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:39,437
McClane!

1059
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,477
In the truck,
let me see the hands.

1060
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:03,597
Put 'em on the door!

1061
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:09,635
Don't kill me! Don't shoot me!

1062
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:13,037
- You a truck driver?
- No, I'm a beautician.

1063
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:15,435
Of course I'm a truck driver!

1064
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:19,671
- Where are you takin' this truck?
- The aqueduct.

1065
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:21,518
What are you takin' a dump truck
to the race track for?

1066
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:26,236
- No, the aqueduct. The aque--
The water aqueduct!
- Aqueduct?

1067
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:32,878
See? Goes from here all the way up
to the Catskill Mountains.

1068
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,877
- What does?
- That! The water pipe!

1069
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,195
Goes for about 60 miles.

1070
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:45,359
- Hey, you the foreman?
- Yeah.

1071
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:49,837
NYPD. You had any, like,
extra dump trucks come through here
in the last couple of minutes?

1072
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:51,791
I'm gonna write
those fuckin' clowns up.

1073
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:54,070
They better start
payin' attention to work orders,
or we're gonna kick some butt.

1074
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:57,351
- Who? Who are you talkin' about?
- Ah, the dozen idiots
who tore ass up the tube!

1075
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:00,313
We're not loadin' up there any more.
We're loadin' over here.

1076
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:02,476
So much for bridges and helicopters.

1077
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:04,477
You got a map that shows me
where this tunnel goes?

1078
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,397
Yeah. Right here.

1079
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:11,669
We run pretty much up
under the Saw Mill
till you get up to the Coffer Dam.

1080
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:14,519
From there on, we've already brought
the water down from the reservoir.

1081
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:18,792
- Anybody get in or outta there?
- Yeah. There's a vent shaft
every two miles.

1082
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:20,353
- No. I mean with a truck.
- At the Coffer Dam.

1083
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:22,755
You can get a truck in there.
You can get there on the surface.

1084
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:25,997
Just follow the Saw Mill River Parkway
up there. It's about 20 miles.

1085
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:27,917
All right. I'm gonna meet you
right there, all right?

1086
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:29,553
Wait, wait!
Wh-What am I supposed to do?

1087
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:32,592
- You're gonna go up to Yankee Stadium.
- McClane!

1088
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,551
Go! Get outta here.
We got less than two hours.

1089
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:36,432
Goddam it!

1090
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:43,590
Hey! Is somethin' wrong?

1091
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:46,075
480 yards of rock moved so far.

1092
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:48,191
Now, that's ten times
the Hoover Dam.

1093
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:52,108
Right now, there's 516 feet of rock
above our heads.

1094
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:54,879
This part is phase three
of tunnel three.

1095
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,958
Planning for it began
back in 1954...

1096
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:00,753
but construction didn't begin
till June of 19 70.

1097
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:03,235
You know what the most interesting part
of tunnel three is?

1098
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:05,749
- What's that,Jerry?
- The valves. Each one--

1099
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:16,558
A big departure
from tunnels one and two.

1100
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:19,956
Come on! What a hell of a place
to break down.

1101
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:22,799
Hold it a minute,Jerry.
Let me have your hard hat.

1102
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:25,559
- You got a jacket?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here.

1103
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:27,716
Wait here a minute.

1104
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:30,354
Wait until he gets
alongside the door.

1105
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:33,790
Hey, fellas.
Mickey O'Brian, aqueduct security.

1106
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:36,878
Hey, listen. We got a report of a guy
comin' through here with eight reindeer.

1107
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:48,756
Yeah, they said he was a jolly, old,
fat guy with a snowy-white beard.

1108
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:51,440
Cute little red and white suit.
I'm surprised you didn't see him.

1109
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,155
What is it with you guys
and these phones?

1110
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,875
This'll give me somethin'.

1111
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,072
Holy shit! Is that guy dead?

1112
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:08,079
- Yes,Jerry. I'm afraid he is.
-Jesus Christ.

1113
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:11,237
Yeah. I want you to get ahold
of a guy named Cobb.

1114
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:14,875
Walter Cobb. C-O-B-B.
He's the head of my police unit.

1115
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,390
Get him down here. Find him.
Tell him you were with John McClane.

1116
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:22,308
- Tell him to find out
who the 21st president was.
- Chester A. Arthur.

1117
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:26,597
- What?
- Chester A. Arthur. 1881to 1885.

1118
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:28,915
Nominated vice president in 1880.

1119
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:31,952
Did you know he was the collector
of customs right here in New York?

1120
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,071
No, I didn't know that,Jerry.

1121
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:35,997
Take care of yourself.

1122
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:06,590
Now?

1123
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:10,110
No, there's only one of them.

1124
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:25,675
Yes or no?

1125
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:28,755
Yes or no?

1126
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:34,756
No.
We need the other one too.

1127
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:40,199
TV's got us. TV's got us.
We gotta release these traffic guys.

1128
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:41,958
No. Traffic jams
we can take care of later.

1129
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:44,310
- You find out what the hell
is wrong with this thing!
- Frequencies are jammed.

1130
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:46,317
- What about Ricky?
- I don't know.
I can't get ahold of him.

1131
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:48,431
- But, Walter, Federal Reserve.
- Yeah?

1132
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,869
Biggest gold storage
in the world.

1133
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,151
You get a unit back down there.
Find Ricky. Find out what the hell
is goin' on.

1134
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:57,599
- Walter!
- Yeah?

1135
01:17:57,720 --> 01:17:59,438
You gotta hear this.

1136
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:05,430
Christ, I thought we were
going in the back way.

1137
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:08,233
This is the back way, Walter.

1138
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:11,272
In half an hour, you're gonna have
a riot at every school in this city.

1139
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:20,074
We'll start at the top floor.
Put 20 men on each floor.

1140
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:22,475
Send the other 50 men
down to the basement with us.

1141
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:24,556
- What about McClane?
- Not a word. I'm gettin' nothin'.

1142
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:26,591
- Busy signals.
- Westchester's probably worse
than we are.

1143
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:28,950
This is kinda puttin' all our eggs
in one basket, isn't it?

1144
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:31,116
- I mean, what if McClane's wrong?
- Walter?
- Yeah?

1145
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:33,708
This is Principal Martinez.
Principal Martinez, Inspector Cobb.

1146
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:36,274
- How do you do, Inspector?
- How do you do, Principal Martinez?

1147
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:40,632
I don't want to alarm your children.
I wonder if you could move them all
into the auditorium and keep them calm.

1148
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:01,592
We are coming to the dam.
You can call the rear guard.

1149
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,830
Rear guard, you can close up now.

1150
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:13,034
We've reached the dam.
You can come up now.

1151
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:18,069
Nils, you can close in now.

1152
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:21,510
- Nils!
- Attention, attention. Nils is dead.

1153
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:24,950
I repeat, Nils is dead, fuck-head.
So is his pal.

1154
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:27,355
And those four guys
from the East German all-stars--

1155
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:29,118
your boys down at the bank--

1156
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:31,117
they're gonna be a little late.

1157
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:33,834
John.

1158
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:39,273
In the back of the truck you're driving,
there's $13 billion worth
in gold bullion.

1159
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:42,551
- I wonder, would a deal
be out of the question?
- Yeah, I got a deal for ya.

1160
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:46,275
Crawl out from under that rock
you're hidin' under, and I'll drive
this truck up your ass.

1161
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:48,719
How colourful.

1162
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,676
I told you not to toy with him.

1163
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,677
Thank you. That's very helpful.

1164
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:04,553
You've jeopardized the mission
and the contract.

1165
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,831
We are vulnerable
till we reach the ship.

1166
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:10,757
I'm going to put an end to this.

1167
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,150
Stop!

1168
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:19,077
Targo! Targo!

1169
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,997
Here! Come here!

1170
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:24,556
- We blow the dam.
- What?

1171
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:26,033
We drown him.

1172
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:38,839
Walter!

1173
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:41,793
Take a look at this. The janitor said
this one was delivered this morning.

1174
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:45,515
About 10:30, right?
Not hooked up.

1175
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:48,393
- Yeah?
- Okay. Now take a look at the front.

1176
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:53,676
We drill the hinges.
Get everybody out.

1177
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:20,236
McClane!

1178
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:23,633
- McClane!
- Where are you?

1179
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:25,273
Over here!

1180
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:27,755
You got a hell of a way
of flaggin' somebody down!

1181
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:30,030
- You all right?
- Did you go to Yankee Stadium?

1182
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:32,549
- Yeah! There's nobody there!
- You didn't see nobody?

1183
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:34,875
- No!
- Nobody was followin' you?

1184
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,036
I'm tellin' you.
He's jerkin' us around.

1185
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:38,957
Oh, shit!Jesus!
Come on! Come on!

1186
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:40,433
''Oh, no! I didn't see nobody.

1187
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:41,595
Nobody's following us.''

1188
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:43,836
Go, go, go!

1189
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,230
It's not rigged. Pull it.

1190
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:04,955
Well, I'd say you could
call off your search.

1191
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:07,230
- Can you stop it?
- I shouldn't even touch it.

1192
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:11,592
Who knows what kind of booby traps
this thing's got. What about the code?

1193
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:13,233
No word.

1194
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:16,477
- When do we evacuate?
- Simon says he sees one kid
leave the building, boom!

1195
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:19,717
Fine. There's a chance
that somebody's still watchin',
but we can't stand here...

1196
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,274
with our thumb up our ass waitin'
for this freakin' thing to blow up!

1197
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,719
Okay.

1198
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:31,395
- Shit! Shit!
- Get your head down!

1199
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:33,670
Come on, Zeus, hold it steady!
Hold it steady!

1200
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:39,948
- Go! Go!
- Outta the way!

1201
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:41,513
Go around him!
Go around him!

1202
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:55,756
- I found out who's the 21st president.
- Who?

1203
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:57,757
Some guy named Arthur.

1204
01:24:57,880 --> 01:24:59,791
- Chester A. Arthur?
- Chester A. Arthur. That's it. Yeah.

1205
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:01,990
- Chester A. Arthur Elementary School?
- Yeah. That's it.

1206
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:05,351
Gently down the stream

1207
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:07,994
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily

1208
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:12,079
- Life is but a dream
- Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily

1209
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:14,760
- Life is but a dream
- Row, row, row your boat

1210
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:17,633
- Gently down the stream
- Life is but a dream

1211
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:21,753
- Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
- Life is but a dream
- Row, row, row your boat

1212
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:24,394
- Gently down the stream
- Row, row, row your boat

1213
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:27,114
- Merrily, merrily, merrily--
- Gently down the--
- Hi, kids!

1214
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:30,630
I know you usually have assembly
on Fridays, but today is special.

1215
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:33,479
Mr Lambert here
is from the fire department...

1216
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:37,275
and today he wants us to practice
a brand-new fire drill.

1217
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:40,949
So, I want you to divide in half,
and I want half of you to go over here--

1218
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:44,231
- teachers will help them--
and line up against the wall.
- Open the door.

1219
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:49,070
The other half will go in this
direction. Please do it very quietly
and very quickly.

1220
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:52,272
All right? Everybody up, please.
Teachers, please help them.

1221
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:55,597
Fire drill, my ass.
That guy ain't from the fire department.

1222
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:57,597
Maybe it's 'cause of the radio.

1223
01:25:57,720 --> 01:26:00,598
You mean, like, they're after us? Nah.

1224
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:03,837
- Tony squealed on us.
- No, he didn't.

1225
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:07,270
- Come on.
- Well, where you goin'?

1226
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:12,155
- Let me drive! Let me drive!
- Go, go, go!

1227
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:13,759
Goddam it!

1228
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:18,473
Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
Of course he put the bomb up
in that school.

1229
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:21,194
- Why would he do that?
- Make sure he got
your complete attention.

1230
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:27,436
-Jesus!Jesus!
- Find the fuse panel.

1231
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:29,039
- What?
- The fuse panel.

1232
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:30,957
- Where's the fuse panel to this car?
- It's right here! It's right here!

1233
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:33,196
- Pull out the anti-lock brakes fuse.
- Shit, I don't know which one it is.

1234
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:35,754
Well, then yank 'em all out then.

1235
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:38,030
- There.
- Put your head down.
Put your head fuckin' down.

1236
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:39,957
This is gonna be really bad.

1237
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:43,789
Listen to me.
Hang the fuck on, all right?

1238
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:12,913
- Oh! Oh! What the fuck happened?
- You got a triple-A card?

1239
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:15,395
- Keep moving. Keep moving.
- Excuse me.

1240
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:17,954
I got the janitors making a last sweep
of the building right now.

1241
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:19,593
Thank you, Miss Martinez.

1242
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:38,799
Come on.

1243
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:41,354
All right, five stud,
three nines, one--

1244
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:43,277
Stay down! Stay low!

1245
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:54,157
Oh, man!

1246
01:27:57,160 --> 01:27:58,878
- What the fuck are you doin'?
- Interrogatin' him.

1247
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,797
Well, what's he gonna tell you,
''I'm dead''?

1248
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:02,638
Well, I ain't gonna know
till I ask him, am I?

1249
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:05,991
Go around and see if there's
any aspirins in that glove box.

1250
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:09,196
No way. You do it.

1251
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:16,396
Ten quarters.

1252
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:19,273
The guy in the dump truck
had ten quarters. Exactly ten quarters.

1253
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:22,119
Well, maybe they were makin'
long distance phone calls.

1254
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:25,437
No. For the bridge.

1255
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:27,152
- What?
- It's for the toll on the bridge.

1256
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:31,190
There! There! Down on the wharf.

1257
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:34,232
Dump trucks.
Right there! Right there!

1258
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:37,950
Christ, they got it loaded
on a ship already.

1259
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:42,150
Shit! How about the Coast Guard?

1260
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:44,236
- It'd take 'em an hour to get here.
- Shit!

1261
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:47,113
Shit! We can jump.

1262
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:48,559
- What?
- We can jump.

1263
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:50,830
Outta your fuckin' mind!
It's 100 feet down to the deck!

1264
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:54,111
- But not to the crane, it isn't.
- The cables would cut you in half.

1265
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:57,072
- I can make it.
- Bullshit. Get down.

1266
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:59,270
Get down. Look in the back
of that car for some gloves.

1267
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:05,997
Six booby traps, four dead ends--

1268
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:08,759
And a partridge in a pear tree

1269
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:15,400
Okay, honey.

1270
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,919
Let's dance.

1271
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:20,510
We're gonna have sort of a race.
So when I say go, I want you all
to run like crazy.

1272
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:22,949
All of you. You follow
the police officer and the fireman.

1273
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:24,877
You guys are my front runners, okay?

1274
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,116
Walter, think we're cuttin' this
a little thin?

1275
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:30,676
No,Joe. We're gonna wait.
McClane still may get the code.

1276
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:35,753
-Line me up with that crane!
-There. There. Right there. Right there.

1277
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:39,156
- Huh? All right.
I see it now. I see it.
- Right there. You're okay.

1278
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:41,510
- Shit. This is gonna take a miracle.
- Keep your fingers crossed.

1279
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:43,676
Swing it. Swing it.

1280
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:47,839
Come on. Come on. You almost got it.
Almost. Almost. Yeah! All right.

1281
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:49,757
Where are you goin'?
What, are you in a hurry?

1282
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:52,633
I'm goin' first this time,
all right?

1283
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:55,433
We have the intercom rigged, sir.

1284
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:59,599
Walter, the kids may be fine,
but you wait much longer and
I'm gonna pee in my pants.

1285
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:01,517
We're gonna wait, Connie.

1286
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:04,397
Six more minutes.

1287
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:19,712
- Yo, McClane.
- What?

1288
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:21,193
Down there.

1289
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:33,278
Oh, shit. Go, go, man!
Go, go, go!

1290
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:00,873
Oh, boy.

1291
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,355
Am I glad you talked me
outta jumpin'.

1292
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:30,551
Fuck.

1293
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:32,477
Get his feet.

1294
01:31:41,720 --> 01:31:43,870
There's something you should see.

1295
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,956
Later.

1296
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:50,117
- It's important.
- Later.

1297
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:51,195
Now.

1298
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:56,434
This was in a container.

1299
01:32:10,640 --> 01:32:15,077
We go find Simon
and drag him to the ship-to-shore radio
and beat that fuckin' code out of him.

1300
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:17,509
- Here. Take this.
- How's it work?

1301
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:21,599
- You don't know how to shoot a gun?
- Look, all brothers don't know how
to shoot guns, you racist motherfucker.

1302
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:25,713
Sue me.Just yank back on that
and pull the trigger. That's it.

1303
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:29,196
- That's it?
- That's it.Just don't shoot yourself.

1304
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:32,278
Hey, don't be no hero.
You find him, you come get me.

1305
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:51,232
Hey, Katya!

1306
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:00,515
Stupid. Stupid.

1307
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:43,878
- You have the autopilot set?
- Yes, sir.

1308
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,752
Good.

1309
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:52,315
Don't fuckin' move.

1310
01:33:57,320 --> 01:33:59,436
Oh, the Samaritan.

1311
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:02,996
- Gimme the goddam code.
- Code? Oh!

1312
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:07,436
You mean for the school.
I'm sorry. I can't do that.

1313
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:09,676
You call in that code right now...

1314
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:12,712
or I blow your sick ass
into the next world.

1315
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:15,919
If that's what you gotta do.

1316
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:31,989
- You gotta take the safety catch off.
- Oh, goddam!

1317
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:35,112
See. That works.
Now where's McClane?

1318
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:53,597
What was that?

1319
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:59,396
He said, ''Don't shoot.''

1320
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:03,354
Okay, Charlie. We're gonna
have to go with the evacuation.

1321
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:06,074
- We're gonna go.
- All right. You heard the man.
Let's go! Let's go!

1322
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:07,679
- Move! Move! Move!
- We're gonna go!
- Let's go, men!

1323
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:12,316
- On my mark.
Five, four, three, two, one, go!
- Let's go! Go!

1324
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:14,317
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1325
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:19,270
Let's do it!
Okay, gang. Let's go!

1326
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:22,233
Go! Go! Go! Hip-hop! Hip-hop!
Come on. Everybody! Let's go!

1327
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:23,918
- Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run!
- Keep moving.

1328
01:35:24,040 --> 01:35:28,158
- We're gonna win! We're gonna win!
- Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1329
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:29,679
Keep moving!
To your left! To your left!

1330
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:45,279
What are they doin'?
Yo, where you goin'?

1331
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:47,311
- Hey, where you goin'?
- What's goin' on?

1332
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:51,433
I see you all day, little man.
Policeman.

1333
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:55,440
And you don't go away.

1334
01:35:55,560 --> 01:35:57,551
Yeah, I'm that fuckin'
Energizer bunny.

1335
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:02,349
Where are you going now, huh?

1336
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:07,757
Going to arrest me, ''bunny''?

1337
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:09,632
No.

1338
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:12,513
I don't think
I'm gonna arrest you.

1339
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:14,949
I'm gonna fuckin'--

1340
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:26,910
I knew it was bullshit.
There's nobody watchin'.

1341
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:28,837
Time to get Charlie out.

1342
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:32,077
- Let's move, Charles. Time's up.
- Give me another 30 seconds.

1343
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:34,236
Takes a minute-15
if you're a kid, Charlie.

1344
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:36,715
And last I looked, you weren't too light
on your feet. Now move!

1345
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:40,394
- Up here!
- Help us!
- Oh, my God!

1346
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:42,317
- Come on!
- Look over here!

1347
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:44,556
- Christ, get 'em outta there!
- Rooms are locked!

1348
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:47,114
- The rooms are locked!
- Get outta the way!

1349
01:36:47,240 --> 01:36:51,756
Hey! Any one marked four!

1350
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:53,632
What's goin' on, Walter?

1351
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:56,035
We still have kids
in the building.

1352
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:03,673
- I'm stayin'.
- No, Charlie. Get outta there.

1353
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:08,239
You ever see that show
called The Addams Family?

1354
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:10,999
They got a motherfucker on there
called Lurch.

1355
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:13,270
You don't think I'm gonna let you
get to that gun, do you?

1356
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:19,399
Fuck!

1357
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:39,996
Help! Help! Help!

1358
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:42,076
Four! Fuck it!
Get outta the way!

1359
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:56,234
- Where are they, Walter?
- Still in.

1360
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:04,715
No guts, no glory.

1361
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:10,477
If we get to the roof,
we can jump to the next building!

1362
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:13,672
- Shit!
- Outta the way.

1363
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:16,951
Okay. Come on.

1364
01:38:17,080 --> 01:38:19,116
Get him up here. Get him up here!
Come on! Come on!

1365
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:22,869
Mayday, mayday. Bridgeport Coast Guard.
Bridgeport Coast Guard, come in.

1366
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:37,557
Come on, kids.

1367
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:44,354
- Shit, it's too far!
- Over here. Down.

1368
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:51,839
No guts, no glory.

1369
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:54,796
There's a big black-and-white fuckin'
boat in the middle of the harbour.

1370
01:38:54,920 --> 01:38:57,354
- Please stay on the line.
- Yeah, sure. I'll stay on the line.

1371
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:16,877
Pancake syrup?

1372
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:18,798
Stupid, stupid--

1373
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:23,752
Hello,John McClane.

1374
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:27,116
There was never any bomb
in the school, was there?

1375
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:29,549
Of course not.

1376
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:32,114
I'm a soldier, not a monster...

1377
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:35,152
even though I sometimes work
for monsters.

1378
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:38,033
No. The real bomb is on this ship.

1379
01:39:42,160 --> 01:39:44,594
Coast Guard.

1380
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:49,669
I was tellin' 'em where the boat was.
Game over, huh?

1381
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:52,792
Not quite over.

1382
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:55,912
Bridgeport Coast Guard.
Come in, please.

1383
01:39:56,040 --> 01:39:58,679
They put you on hold?

1384
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:00,597
She told me to stay on the line.

1385
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:08,111
- Oh, God, I love this country.
- You know, your brother was an asshole.

1386
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:12,830
- You know, he really was an asshole.
- He was-- He was an asshole.

1387
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:16,714
You, you got his number, yeah?
Yeah, okay.

1388
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:22,150
Forgive me.
Would you help Mr McClane below?

1389
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:25,716
Careful now.

1390
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:30,316
Now, do you have the communique?

1391
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:32,192
Bridgeport radio,
come in, please. Bridgeport.

1392
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:34,072
- Coast Guard.
- Are you there, dear?

1393
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:37,988
- Yes, we're here.
- Do you have the ability
to record a message?

1394
01:40:38,120 --> 01:40:40,076
- Yes.
- Then please begin now.

1395
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:41,519
Right.

1396
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:49,034
This is a communique
from the CRF.

1397
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:52,835
For too long, the West has conspired
to steal the wealth of the world...

1398
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:56,509
consigning the balance of humanity
to economic starvation.

1399
01:40:56,640 --> 01:40:59,359
Today, we will level
the playing field.

1400
01:40:59,480 --> 01:41:02,552
In a few minutes, the contents
of the Federal Reserve Bank--

1401
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:05,274
the gold your economies
are built on--

1402
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:08,198
will be redistributed by explosive...

1403
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:10,197
across the bottom
of the Long Island Sound.

1404
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:15,150
If you are not in gridlock,
I invite you to come and watch.

1405
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:22,838
- You're gonna blow it all up?
- That's the idea.

1406
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:24,757
There are some gentlemen
in the Middle East...

1407
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:27,474
who seem to think that they'll make
a great deal of money.

1408
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:31,115
See the men safely off the ship, and
I'll see you in the port-side launch.

1409
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:34,634
The hell's all this
got to do with killin' McClane?

1410
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:38,350
Life has its little bonuses.

1411
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:40,755
Didn't I hear you say
you didn't even like your brother?

1412
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:42,950
There's a difference, you know,
between not liking one's brother...

1413
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:46,470
and not caring when some dumb Irish
flatfoot drops him out of a window.

1414
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:48,477
Hey, I didn't even know
that motherfucker!

1415
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:50,795
Yes, and I never invited you
aboard this ship.

1416
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:52,433
No riddle is gonna stop
this motherfucker?

1417
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:55,279
No code, no riddle,
no fancy little countdown.

1418
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:58,949
Hey, fuck-head.
Yeah, you. Fuck-head.

1419
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:03,676
There's just one thing
I gotta know.

1420
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:08,430
You got any aspirins? I've had
a bad fuckin' headache all day long.

1421
01:42:11,240 --> 01:42:12,878
Must be your lucky day.

1422
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:15,759
Keep the bottle.

1423
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:29,397
Where is the gold?

1424
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:33,836
He's betrayed us.

1425
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:36,520
The containers
are filled with that.

1426
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:10,030
If I hadn't have saved your fuckin' ass,
I wouldn't be sittin' here with you...

1427
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:12,390
about to blow up with $100 billion
in fuckin' gold!

1428
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:14,954
Yeah, well, I got some bad news.
You're only gonna blow up with me.

1429
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:16,718
- What?
- There's no gold on this boat.

1430
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:19,593
- How do you know that?
- 'Cause I know the man.
I know the family.

1431
01:43:19,720 --> 01:43:24,271
The only thing better than blowin' up
$100 billion worth of gold is makin'
people think you did.

1432
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:27,392
- Yeah? Well, where is it?
- I don't know. He must have switched it
back on the dock somewhere.

1433
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:29,317
Oh, yeah. That's supposed
to make me feel better?

1434
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:32,432
No. You're wrong about the other thing,
though. You're not gonna die.

1435
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:35,552
Yeah? You know
some cop trick about handcuffs
that's gonna get us outta this?

1436
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:38,194
Yeah. Use a key.

1437
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:40,595
- You know how to pick this lock?
- Is this some black shit again?

1438
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:43,109
Will you stop with that racial shit?
Are you a fuckin' locksmith or not?

1439
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:45,754
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can do it
if I had somethin' to do it with.

1440
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:48,872
- How about a splinter
of that cable I slid down?
- That might work.

1441
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:53,995
- Hold on.
- Fuck are you doin'?

1442
01:43:57,160 --> 01:44:00,789
Oh, fuck! Shit!
How's that? That big enough?

1443
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:02,956
Shit. Yeah.
Yeah, that might work.

1444
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:06,038
All right. Then I'm gonna drop it
in your hands. Cup your hands.

1445
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:07,912
Don't drop this motherfucker,
all right?

1446
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:10,918
- Get, get it right. Come on. One--
- You ready? Ready?

1447
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:13,031
Two-- Spit it.

1448
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:16,391
- Yeah! Get it?
- Come on. Come on. Move your hands.

1449
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:18,875
All right. Okay.

1450
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,275
Damn, McClane. You know,
I was just startin' to like you.

1451
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:24,870
- Yeah? Well, don't. I'm an asshole.
- What are you talkin' about now?

1452
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,798
- I lied to you, Zeus.
- About what?

1453
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:30,718
You remember I said
Weiss found that bomb up in Harlem?

1454
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:32,558
- Yeah.
- They found it down in Chinatown.

1455
01:44:32,680 --> 01:44:35,433
Oh, now that's low--
even for a white motherfucker like you.

1456
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:37,915
I told you I was an asshole.

1457
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:40,076
What the fuck was that?

1458
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:42,555
I don't know.

1459
01:44:42,680 --> 01:44:44,671
Look, it was the only way
I could get you to come with me.

1460
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:46,870
Uh-huh.
You got a wife, McClane?

1461
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,992
- Yeah.
- I'm surprised anybody'd stay with you
long enough to be married.

1462
01:44:50,120 --> 01:44:53,157
Yeah. Well, she didn't stick around
too long. We're sorta separated.

1463
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:54,759
What the fuck is ''sorta separated''?

1464
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:57,678
Well, she was in LA,
I was in New York.

1465
01:44:57,800 --> 01:45:01,315
Had a fight on the phone. She hung up.
I didn't call her back.

1466
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:04,671
- How long ago was that?
- About a year ago now.

1467
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:06,597
About a yea--

1468
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:10,794
What the fuck
are you laughin' about?

1469
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:14,549
You threw away your marriage
because you were too fuckin' stupid
to pick up the phone?

1470
01:45:14,680 --> 01:45:16,830
What, you think that's funny, huh?
You laugh at other people's misfortunes?

1471
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:18,678
I bet you blame that shit
on your wife too, right?

1472
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:20,870
Well, my wife
is a very stubborn woman, yes.

1473
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:26,029
You better stop fuckin' laughin'
and undo these cuffs.

1474
01:45:26,160 --> 01:45:28,196
I'm almost there!

1475
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:30,709
There! How's that for concentration?
Oh, shit!

1476
01:45:30,840 --> 01:45:32,398
- What?
- Fuck! I dropped the thing!

1477
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:35,080
- Dropped the fucking thing?
- Goddam it!

1478
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:37,430
- Shit! Where is it? Where did it go?
- Find it. Find it, all right?

1479
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:40,120
I don't fuckin' see it.

1480
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:43,760
What the fuck is that?

1481
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:46,599
I think I made it mad.

1482
01:45:46,720 --> 01:45:48,199
Just go, McClane.
Get the fuck out of here.

1483
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:51,437
- Gotta fuckin' do somethin'!
- Goddam it, McClane! Listen to me!

1484
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:54,955
Just go.

1485
01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:57,674
Have a hard enough time gettin' through
the day without havin' your death
on my conscience, man.

1486
01:45:57,800 --> 01:45:59,711
- Shut the fuck up and think, all right?
- Okay, okay.

1487
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:02,673
- Tools. Tools. Check the engine room.
- There's no time!

1488
01:46:03,880 --> 01:46:05,677
- What the hell's it doin' now?
- It's mixin'.

1489
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:07,279
Shit!

1490
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:10,637
- What the hell are you doin'?
- Get ready. Lean forward.

1491
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:13,115
- What?
- Lean forward, goddam it!

1492
01:46:13,240 --> 01:46:15,151
What? The fuck you doin'?

1493
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:17,032
Now it's gonna go fast.
Lean forward.

1494
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:19,628
- Oh, no, no!
- Lean forward! Get ready!
Move your hands!

1495
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:22,115
Damn! Motherfuckin' shit!

1496
01:46:22,240 --> 01:46:25,198
- Come on. Let's go!
- Oh, goddam! Goddam!

1497
01:46:25,320 --> 01:46:28,278
- Come on! Come on!
- Oh, fuck! My leg! Ow!

1498
01:46:29,440 --> 01:46:33,558
Get upstairs! Come on!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Get upstairs!

1499
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:36,875
Oh, shit! Ow! Damn it! My foot!

1500
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:38,672
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Down there at the back of the boat.
Come on!

1501
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:41,234
- No, damn it!
- Run, goddam it!

1502
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:43,351
- I am, you--
- Come on!

1503
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:45,357
- All right? Watch! Watch! Watch!
- Yeah.

1504
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:47,675
Let's go! Down here!
The back of the--

1505
01:47:14,640 --> 01:47:15,993
How's he doin'?

1506
01:47:16,120 --> 01:47:18,554
I got shot in the leg.
How do ya think I'm doin'?

1507
01:47:18,680 --> 01:47:21,478
- He's gonna be just fine.
- How about you?

1508
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:24,398
I'm all right.
Did ya get Ricky out of there?

1509
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:27,957
Yeah, they found him.

1510
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:32,551
- Are you gonna be all right?
- Got a bad headache.

1511
01:47:32,680 --> 01:47:35,240
- Think they're mad at me?
- I wouldn't worry about them.

1512
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:38,750
They'll get to you eventually,
but right now they're busy with
this salvage operation, I guess.

1513
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:41,997
No! Dre-Dredges! Dredges!

1514
01:47:42,120 --> 01:47:44,076
They're just wastin' their time.
There's no gold out there.

1515
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:46,031
- What do you mean?
- He took it with him.

1516
01:47:46,160 --> 01:47:49,357
- He beat me.
-John, he beat all of us.

1517
01:47:49,480 --> 01:47:51,994
- He wasn't playin' against you.
- Fuck that, McClane.

1518
01:47:52,120 --> 01:47:55,192
You're still alive, aren't ya?

1519
01:47:55,320 --> 01:47:57,914
- Well, aren't ya?
- Yeah.

1520
01:47:58,040 --> 01:48:00,600
So he lost. Lambert.

1521
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:03,188
Would you give him a quarter?

1522
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:04,878
Asshole.

1523
01:48:07,160 --> 01:48:08,957
- Take it easy.
- I got him.
- That's it.

1524
01:48:09,080 --> 01:48:10,672
- Easy.
- Yeah, this is collect from John.

1525
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:13,075
Thanks, guys. Appreciate this.

1526
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:21,192
Yeah, uh, Carmine, just tell him
you'll accept the charges.

1527
01:48:21,320 --> 01:48:24,118
Son of a bitch had aspirin.

1528
01:48:24,240 --> 01:48:26,151
Yeah, it's John.
Yeah, I'm hangin' in there.

1529
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:28,396
Is Holly there?
Yeah, I'll hold on.

1530
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:46,112
Zeus, hold up! Whoa!

1531
01:48:46,240 --> 01:48:50,677
John? John? John?
Goddam it,you son of a--

1532
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:18,871
Yesterday--

1533
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:22,595
Yesterday we were an army
with no country.

1534
01:49:22,720 --> 01:49:26,235
Tomorrow, we have to decide...

1535
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:29,629
which country we want to buy.

1536
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:37,995
And remember,
this is all due...

1537
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:43,353
to the g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-gullibility
of the New York Police Department.

1538
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:48,869
To fallen comrades.

1539
01:50:13,160 --> 01:50:15,151
Leutnant, take over.

1540
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:17,191
All right. Listen up!
First squad...

1541
01:50:17,320 --> 01:50:19,709
you muster up in half an hour
in the school bus!

1542
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:21,398
You'll be the lacrosse team!

1543
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:24,990
The plane's in Nova Scotia.
We can leave in twenty minutes.

1544
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:34,393
No rush.

1545
01:50:34,520 --> 01:50:38,877
And,Jurgen,
you'll be the Padre!

1546
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:40,319
Padre?

1547
01:51:02,720 --> 01:51:04,517
Lights! Douse those lights!

1548
01:51:26,520 --> 01:51:30,433
Hey, dick-head.!
Did I come at a bad time?

1549
01:51:35,560 --> 01:51:38,597
Whoa! I think
she's pissed at you, McClane!

1550
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:50,235
Go! Go!

1551
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:00,312
He's under us right now. Come on
back around. Come on back around.

1552
01:52:00,440 --> 01:52:02,510
- That's right. Run, motherfuckers.
- Zeus, what've we got on your side?

1553
01:52:02,640 --> 01:52:04,437
Look like roaches
with the lights comin' on.

1554
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:10,549
- Are we going to Nova Scotia?
- You go with the trucks!

1555
01:52:10,680 --> 01:52:12,830
I have something personal
to finish.

1556
01:52:15,640 --> 01:52:17,437
Let's go to work!

1557
01:52:18,960 --> 01:52:20,871
Come on! Move it!

1558
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:33,591
That's right. Run, motherfuckers!
The exterminators are here!

1559
01:52:45,160 --> 01:52:48,948
What the fuck? Oh, shit!
What the fuck is this smoke back here?

1560
01:52:49,080 --> 01:52:51,719
We got a chopper behind us.
You got a gun on board?

1561
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:54,035
What is this?

1562
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:59,437
Can't see a goddam thing. Hold it
still. I can't see a goddam thing.

1563
01:53:03,240 --> 01:53:05,834
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, shit!

1564
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:08,030
What do you mean, ''Oh, shit''?

1565
01:53:09,240 --> 01:53:10,958
All right. Hang on. Hang on.
We're goin' down.

1566
01:53:11,080 --> 01:53:12,877
Between those high tension wires?
See this wire?

1567
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,355
Hey, McClane! What the fuck?

1568
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:20,556
Hey, we got smoke! We got fuckin' smoke
and shit flyin' on me here!

1569
01:53:23,320 --> 01:53:25,197
- Truck! Truck!
- Hold on. Here we go!

1570
01:53:31,360 --> 01:53:35,399
Come on. We gotta get outta here! He's
gonna start shootin' at us any second!

1571
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:38,398
- Get him out of here.
- Shit! The belt's stuck!
I can't get it off!

1572
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:40,397
Look out! Here he comes!

1573
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:43,991
Can't get out, McClane!

1574
01:53:44,120 --> 01:53:46,839
- Get him outta here.
- Where're you goin'?

1575
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:49,076
I'm gonna try
and get his attention.

1576
01:54:06,280 --> 01:54:09,875
Oh, shit! It just keeps
gettin' better and better.

1577
01:54:15,200 --> 01:54:18,590
I had no idea Canada
could be this much fun.

1578
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:25,988
Just give me somethin' to shoot at.
Come on, hotshot.

1579
01:54:27,080 --> 01:54:29,230
Show me that smilin' face.

1580
01:54:49,720 --> 01:54:51,551
Say hello to your brother.

1581
01:54:53,560 --> 01:54:55,152
Get outta here!

1582
01:55:10,600 --> 01:55:13,751
Yippee-ki-ay, motherfucker.

1583
01:55:16,760 --> 01:55:19,832
- Looks like you got his attention.
- Yeah. It looks like it.

1584
01:55:22,200 --> 01:55:25,476
- Think we should call a fire truck?
- Aw, fuck 'em. Let 'em cook.

1585
01:55:28,040 --> 01:55:31,077
- Oh, shit!
- What?

1586
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:32,474
What?

1587
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:35,672
- I left Holly hangin' on hold.
- Aw, call her back.

1588
01:55:37,080 --> 01:55:39,310
I don't know.
She's gonna be pissed.

1589
01:55:39,440 --> 01:55:41,908
She'll get over it.

1590
01:55:42,040 --> 01:55:44,998
I don't know, Zeus.

1591
01:55:45,120 --> 01:55:47,190
Like I said...

1592
01:55:47,320 --> 01:55:49,276
she's a very stubborn woman.

1593
01:55:49,400 --> 01:55:51,868
Well, she'd have to be
to stay married to you.
