1
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,566
Then sings my soul

2
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:51,775
My saviour God, to thee

3
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:55,900
How great thou art

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,483
How great thou art

5
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:04,066
Then sings my soul

6
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:09,108
My saviour God, to thee

7
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:13,150
How great thou art

8
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:18,733
How great thou art

9
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:22,733
When through the woods

10
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:27,983
And forest glades I wander

11
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:35,240
And hear the birds sing sweetly
in the trees

12
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:39,691
When I look down

13
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:45,108
From lofty mountain grandeur

14
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:48,233
And hear the brook

15
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:53,108
And feel the gentle breeze

16
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:56,650
Then sings my soul

17
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:01,691
My saviour God, to thee

18
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:05,775
How great thou art

19
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:09,941
How great thou art

20
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:13,483
Then sings my soul

21
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:18,525
My saviour God, to thee

22
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:22,608
How great thou art

23
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:28,358
How great thou art

24
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:32,066
When Christ shall come

25
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:36,900
With shouts of acclamation

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,108
And take me home

27
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:44,858
What joy shall fill my heart!

28
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:52,074
Then I shall bow in humble adoration

29
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:55,941
And there proclaim

30
00:02:56,041 --> 00:03:00,525
My God, how great thou art

31
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:04,441
Then sings my soul

32
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:08,074
My saviour God...

33
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,858
Make the most of this beautiful train.

34
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,740
That's it. Okay.

35
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,108
Yeah.

36
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,358
That's really great, yeah, yeah.

37
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:40,650
Okay, now as I said before,
you're under no obligation to

38
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,858
but you can if you want to,
give me a tiny little twinkle.

39
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,358
Yeah, that is... Lovely.

40
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,074
Great.

41
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,615
A little bit closer.

42
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,483
Now, don't you worry.
You'll be all right.

43
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,782
There's just a little bit, that's it.

44
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,816
And you've got an eyelash on your nose.
We don't want that, do we?

45
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,408
It's supposed to be on your eye,
not on your snitch.

46
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:08,775
That's it. You've got a lovely smile
when you smile, haven't you?

47
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,358
Right, okay.

48
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,525
Now, you keep that lovely
gorgeous smile.

49
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,324
That's lovely.

50
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,941
I think that'll do for the time being.

51
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,409
Well done, Sarah.
That's the easy bit.

52
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,108
They make a noise, don't they?

53
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,608
At least they can play out around here.

54
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,157
I suppose so.

55
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,407
- What is it?
- Is that a suit?

56
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,108
Well, it came as a combination.

57
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,949
Do they go together?

58
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,650
Well, if you think they do, they do

59
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,316
and if you think they don't, they don't.

60
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,949
It's nice.

61
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,157
Twenty-one in August.

62
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,358
She is.

63
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,733
I used to worry meself sick
when she played out.

64
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,566
She survived it though, didn't she?

65
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,775
All things considering.

66
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,441
She's back on the streets now.

67
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:21,733
I beg your pardon?

68
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,608
Well, she is, isn't she?

69
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:25,699
I don't half-miss her.

70
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,240
I know.

71
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,949
How long is it since we've seen her?

72
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:32,983
Two-and-a-half years.

73
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:37,900
We could always ask her over.

74
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,108
- I'd like to.
- For her birthday.

75
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,108
It's only a couple of months away.

76
00:05:43,056 --> 00:05:44,782
What now?

77
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:48,615
"Hey, Roxanne, what are you
doing for your 21 st?"

78
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:52,525
"I'm goin' over to my auntie and
uncle's house for my birthday treat."

79
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,699
It was only a suggestion.

80
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,150
She's probably doing her own thing.

81
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,324
I suppose we'd have to invite
Cynthia as well.

82
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,858
There's no show without Punch.

83
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,733
I'm sure she'd like to see the place.

84
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,400
Oh, I'm sure she would.

85
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,032
- She can't help it.
- Can't she?

86
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,032
It's about time you showed it off.

87
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,441
I mean, you've done a lovely job.

88
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,365
I think so.

89
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,816
I really must get down to see her.

90
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,066
You speak to her
on the phone, don't you?

91
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,657
It's not the same thing though, is it?

92
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,615
She's your sister.

93
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,365
I'm really proud of that portrait.

94
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:44,115
I reckon that's the last time
she ever smiled.

95
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,941
I dunno what's got into you lately.

96
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,865
You complaining?

97
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,233
- No.
- Well, shut up then.

98
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:40,066
Sit here on me own for years on end.

99
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,650
Can't get you to stop in at all.

100
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,733
- And now you never go out.
- Leave it out.

101
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,733
You've been sitting there for a month
with a face like a slapped arse.

102
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,199
Well, what's there to smile about?

103
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,191
I thought he might've phoned
at the weekend.

104
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,949
Who?

105
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:59,733
Who d'you think?

106
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,483
I ain't heard from 'im for ages.

107
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,566
- He's busy, ain't he?
- We're all busy.

108
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:06,400
He's got his weddings and that.
It's the summer.

109
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,025
Out of sight, out of mind.

110
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,025
Well, if you're that bothered,
why don't you ring him yourself?

111
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,191
He's your brother.

112
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,782
I'm not running up me phone bill.

113
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,699
He knows where I am if he wants me.

114
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,108
He'd have had us up there to see it by now,
I expect, if it weren't for her.

115
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,699
Toffee-nosed cow.

116
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:31,740
What's he want with
six bedrooms, anyway?

117
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,816
What's all your mates
doing tonight, then?

118
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,365
I don't know. I ain't asked 'em.

119
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,066
You wanna get yourself a bloke.

120
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,608
That's what you wanna do.

121
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,191
I've told you.
I don't wanna get anything.

122
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,316
I'm quite happy here,
thank you very much.

123
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:01,316
When I was your age,
I could've had the pick of the crop.

124
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,066
Well, why didn't you?

125
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,233
Because I lost my poor mother,
that's why.

126
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,566
Oh, here we go.

127
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,900
I was stuck at home here
from the age of 10,

128
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,941
looking after Maurice and your granddad.

129
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,775
Yeah, we know.

130
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,400
Then I got saddled with you.

131
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,691
That was my downfall, darling.

132
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,608
I didn't ask to be born.

133
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,525
No, and I never asked
to have you, neither.

134
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:24,532
Well, you should've thought about that
before you dropped your knickers.

135
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,150
With...

136
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,650
Or without?

137
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,941
I think without.

138
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,199
- Without? Okay.
- Yeah.

139
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:44,275
What about this one?
Better with or without?

140
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,108
I think this time it's with.

141
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:49,199
With? All right,
we'll pop this one in, then.

142
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,941
I hear you're a really good runner.

143
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:56,191
- Yeah. Cross-country.
- Have you won anything?

144
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,483
Not yet. I've only just started.

145
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,983
Okay, then. Look up again.

146
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,358
Now, this is gonna blur a bit

147
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:05,782
- but just tell me what you can read, okay?
- Yeah.

148
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,949
H-L-A-C-T.

149
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:12,025
- Right.
- And I can't read any more.

150
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,740
Okay, that's good.

151
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,574
Very good,
I'm gonna do your other eye now.

152
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,775
- Are you off, then?
- Yeah.

153
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:30,983
Got any plans for the weekend?

154
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,441
Well, I've got to go to my mum's house
and sort through her things.

155
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:34,900
- Oh, have you?
- Yeah.

156
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,025
Hope it goes all right.

157
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,691
- Well, it's gotta be done.
- Yeah.

158
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,691
- Okay, then.
- Right, I'll see you on Monday.

159
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:40,858
Yeah.

160
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,025
- Have a nice weekend.
- Cheers.

161
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,525
Ooh, enjoy the christening.

162
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,199
- I'll try. Bye.
- Okay. Bye.

163
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,358
It's 10 past.
We've got to pick Shelattica up.

164
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:36,025
- What are you talking about?
- We've got 10 minutes.

165
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,150
Listen, we've got to sort
this out while we're here.

166
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,900
Look, basically, right, it's you, one, here,
in this massive house.

167
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,691
- Thank you.
- This house is massive.

168
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,441
We have got two children,
you understand?

169
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,066
- And we could have more.
- What?

170
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,858
We wanna have more.

171
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:53,441
Listen, right, you can't stay here
on your own. It's not fair, is it?

172
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:56,150
I mean, we can sell the house, can't we?
Sell the house and split the money.

173
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,691
Listen, you know what? You could split
this whole house in two, right?

174
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,400
You could split this into two flats
and it'd still be bigger than our place.

175
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,525
- Split it in two?
- Exactly.

176
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:03,608
You can't split it in two...

177
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,150
Now, let's sort your tie out
for you, if I may.

178
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,691
- Looks just a little bit skew-whiffy.
- Oh, skew-whiff again.

179
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:47,983
Yes, that's lovely.

180
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,941
- Do you want the paper out?
- Yeah, yeah, okay.

181
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:55,025
You ladies look gorgeous.
Hands together there.

182
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,400
Very nice, okay. Here we go.

183
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,983
Put your paper down there.

184
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,191
Right then, here we go. Okay, and...

185
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,733
Do we say "cheese", Maurice?

186
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,733
Well, you can if you like,
but you can, you can say "cheese".

187
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:08,816
You can say whatever you like.
But just give me a little...

188
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:09,983
That's it.

189
00:13:11,074 --> 00:13:12,858
Yeah, very sweet.

190
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:15,400
Great, that's lovely.

191
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,650
- So, that took you 15 years, yeah?
- Yes.

192
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,150
- They give you a prize?
- No.

193
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,607
Not even a stethoscope or something?
Lovely.

194
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,191
Yeah, that's really lovely.
Come out, Jane.

195
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,441
I'm so glad he's got his eyes open.

196
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,525
That's it, yeah, that's it,
and give him a hand.

197
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,657
Look down. Lovely.

198
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,275
Are you gonna see that flea collar?

199
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,150
- Are you going to see that?
- Don't worry about that.

200
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,400
You come out now, come out.

201
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,691
- You just come out the way.
- That's it.

202
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:41,150
And pop out now.
And out, and here we go.

203
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,150
I think you left the comb
in there that time.

204
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,733
Lovely, very good.

205
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:45,983
Oh, did he look good?

206
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,983
- He does look good, yeah. So do you.
- Oh, good, yes.

207
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:51,150
Thank you very much, Jane.
That's lovely.

208
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,275
- It's for my auntie.
- Oh, right. Fond of you, is she?

209
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:56,400
- No, she's in India.
- Oh, right.

210
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,775
Time I got married, innit?

211
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:02,025
Oh, I see. Pick a bride time, is it?

212
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,608
I've told you, I don't want flash, it...

213
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,316
Lovely!

214
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,324
I never thought I'd have any...

215
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,566
Fertility treatment.

216
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,650
It's a miracle.

217
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,400
Don't do that with your nose.

218
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,191
Now stop it. Put it there. That's it.

219
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:21,150
Hello, Dominic. Now look
at that lovely cat, look over there.

220
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,775
- Look at that cat.
- He's lovely.

221
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,650
- Oh, that's it, let him scratch it first.
- No!

222
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,358
Go on, that's it, that's it.

223
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:31,441
- Lovely!
- I feel so silly.

224
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,441
A-ha, lovely and that's it.

225
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,115
Thank you very much.

226
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,858
- What d'you think you're doing?
- Sorry.

227
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,025
Didn't you hear me?

228
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,775
No, I didn't.

229
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,358
- Hiya.
- What?

230
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,824
- Hiya.
- Mind out of the way.

231
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,858
- D'you want a drink?
- What?

232
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:09,199
If I want a drink
I'll get it myself, thank you.

233
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:25,615
Since when was hoovering
a spectator sport?

234
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,525
Can I have a glass, too, please?

235
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:30,941
I'm sorry, I thought
you didn't want a drink.

236
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,275
I've changed my mind. I'm having milk.

237
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,566
Not in a wine glass, give me a highball.

238
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,691
- You don't put milk in a wine glass.
- There you go.

239
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,941
- Thank you.
- That'll do you good.

240
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,199
- Meaning?
- Nothing.

241
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,824
- Had a good day?
- Scintillating.

242
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:51,407
I suppose you'll be starving as usual.

243
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,949
A little bit peckish, yeah.

244
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,150
Do you want me to do something?

245
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,191
- Like what?
- Anything you like.

246
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,983
No, I bloody well wouldn't.

247
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,865
- Fair enough.
- Oh, all right, then.

248
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:07,865
There's the fridge, there's the freezer.

249
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,691
There's the hob.

250
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,191
There's the recipe books.

251
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:12,990
Help yourself.

252
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,615
And don't make a mess.

253
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,782
Unless you fancy a takeaway.

254
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,108
- You're not gonna smile, are you?
- No.

255
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,941
Okay, it's a free world.

256
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,483
Now, you're under no obligation,

257
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:45,775
but you can if you want to
give me a lovely big smile.

258
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,566
And thank you.

259
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:50,525
Oh, go on. Come on. Lovely.

260
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,608
You're under no obligation to me,
but you can smile if you like.

261
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,400
Yeah, thank you.

262
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,066
- Did you smile, Mother?
- No.

263
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,639
That's it, to me. That's it,
now look at each other.

264
00:16:59,739 --> 00:17:02,691
That's it, it'll probably be all right.

265
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,900
Go on, look up, keep your face up.
That's lovely.

266
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,240
You're closing your eyes.

267
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,025
Don't forget to burp it properly.

268
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,157
Give it a drop of Gripe Water.

269
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:40,657
We used to pour it down
Roxanne by the gallon.

270
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,483
She farted like a trouper.

271
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,157
Runs in the family.

272
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,316
Would madame care
to test the temperature?

273
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,740
I'm sure it'll be fine. Thanks.

274
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:03,775
Been bad, has it?

275
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,566
It eased off at lunchtime.

276
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,775
I managed a couple of crackers.

277
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,108
It's unpredictable, isn't it?

278
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,441
No, it's not unpredictable.

279
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,618
You've drawn the short straw, mate.

280
00:18:16,718 --> 00:18:21,115
You're telling me.
I wish it was unpredictable.

281
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,025
What're you gonna have for your tea?

282
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,025
Do you know what I really fancy?

283
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:31,490
- What?
- A steak.

284
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,900
You're not having
any steak in this house.

285
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,316
Don't worry about me.

286
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,566
You'll be keeling over
with a heart attack.

287
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:42,532
- I'll do meself something later.
- There's a chicken Kiev in the freezer.

288
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,316
Be a bit cold, wouldn't it?

289
00:18:46,182 --> 00:18:47,824
Anyway...

290
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:50,199
I'm on a diet.

291
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,525
You're disgusting.

292
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:55,733
Okay, that's very good.
We can see the ring perfectly.

293
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:59,066
All right now, sir,
if you just bring your chin up.

294
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:02,650
Yeah, just slightly, that's perfect.
That's brilliant, all right, great.

295
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,608
Sorry, sorry, listen,
take your glasses off.

296
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,650
I don't want to take my glasses off.

297
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,441
Go on, take them off.

298
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:09,983
Doesn't matter.
Keep them on, take them off.

299
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,865
- No, he looks better without them.
- It's what I look like, okay.

300
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,566
Right, okay, and to me...

301
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,941
One moment, please.
Can you take the cross out, please?

302
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,525
Take the cross out.

303
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,483
It's a gift, take it out.

304
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,608
I just think it looks awful.

305
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:24,733
It doesn't look awful.

306
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,941
It looks awful, because it's not gold.
I told you, buy gold.

307
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,066
Okay, right.

308
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,400
Okay, and to me, yeah,
right, that's lovely.

309
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,608
Now, do you want to look happy or sad?
I don't mind, whatever.

310
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:40,657
And keep your...
And look at me. And lovely.

311
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:22,990
Hello. My name's Hortense Cumberbatch.

312
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,449
I got your letter. Hi.

313
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,865
Oh, right. Tuesday.

314
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,615
Hello?

315
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,358
Hortense, hello. Jennie Ford.

316
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,150
- Nice to meet you. Come this way.
- Oh, hi.

317
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,983
- How are you? All right?
- Fine, thank you.

318
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,441
- Good.
- I'm sorry about this prison cell.

319
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,691
We've been banging on about it
for years, but there you go.

320
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,025
Have a seat, make yourself at home.

321
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:59,566
Now, before we go any further,
have you got any ID?

322
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:02,032
- Passport, driving licence.
- Yeah.

323
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:05,025
You'll have to get used to all this red tape.
Would you like a Rolo?

324
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,282
- No, thank you. Yeah.
- Are you sure?

325
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,650
There you go.

326
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,699
Let's have a shifty.

327
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,316
That's great. Hortense. Thank you.

328
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:20,358
- Are you on your lunch break?
- Yeah, an extended one.

329
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:21,900
- Have you had any lunch?
- No, not yet.

330
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,733
No. Me, neither.

331
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:26,150
- So, what do you do?
- I'm an optometrist.

332
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,150
Oh, really? Oh, God.

333
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,358
It's one of those things you keep
putting off and putting off, isn't it?

334
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,400
And I've got to the stage now
with the Guardian crossword,

335
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,150
where I'm going like this, so I think
the time has come, don't you?

336
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,316
I'll have to pop in,
you can give me a test.

337
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,941
- Where do you live?
- Kilburn.

338
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:44,115
- Right, right, in a flat?
- Yes.

339
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,441
- Do you share?
- No, I live on my own.

340
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:48,324
Oh, right.

341
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,066
I lived on my own.

342
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:52,316
For about six years,
before I was married.

343
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,275
It's all right, isn't it?

344
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,490
Right, Hortense.

345
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,941
Let's talk a little bit
about you, shall we?

346
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:02,150
Now obviously you've been giving
a great deal of thought to things

347
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,316
and you've come to a decision,
which is good.

348
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:07,532
But for me, the question is, "Why now?"

349
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:12,483
I just feel that it's
the right time, that's all.

350
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,191
Right, right.

351
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,608
- Are you thinking about getting married?
- No.

352
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,316
- Do you have children?
- No.

353
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:19,858
Are you thinking about having children?

354
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:21,025
No.

355
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:22,608
That's fair enough.

356
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,483
Are you sharing this with your parents?

357
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:26,358
Do they know that you're here today?

358
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,108
How do they feel about it?

359
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:30,358
They're both dead, actually.

360
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:31,650
Oh, right.

361
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:35,615
Yeah, Mum died two months ago now.

362
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:38,990
Oh, that's recent.
I'm sorry to hear that.

363
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:41,365
- Was it sudden?
- Yeah.

364
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:47,108
Perhaps that's what's
made you start all this.

365
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:48,691
I don't know.

366
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:51,032
It's possible.

367
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:54,233
Well, I'm not trying to replace her.
She's irreplaceable.

368
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:57,782
- Well, they both are.
- No, of course, of course.

369
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,441
And when you were growing up,
was it, was it a happy environment?

370
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:04,400
- Yes, very.
- Oh, good, good.

371
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,316
And did you...

372
00:23:06,416 --> 00:23:09,441
Were you able to discuss
the fact that you'd been...

373
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:12,108
No, it was never really an issue.

374
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:13,941
Right, right.

375
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:15,400
So, you've only just found out?

376
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,650
Oh, no, they told me when I was little.

377
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:20,483
Oh, good, good. And do you
remember how you felt about that?

378
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:22,400
Well, it's not exactly
something you forget, is it?

379
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,532
No, no. I'm sure it isn't.

380
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,782
So, how did you feel?

381
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:33,858
Well, we all just got on
with it as a family.

382
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:36,066
Do you know what I mean?

383
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:38,074
Yeah.

384
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,282
Perhaps you should've discussed it.

385
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:46,699
My parents loved me and
that was all that matters, isn't it?

386
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:49,657
Yeah, yeah.

387
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:54,782
So, now that we've got you here,
what are your expectations?

388
00:23:55,916 --> 00:24:00,115
Basically, I just want to know.

389
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,365
Yeah, yeah, of course, you do.

390
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:06,699
Let me share something
with you, Hortense.

391
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:12,566
Somewhere out there, and we don't know
where, is your birth mother...

392
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:16,115
Now, she's probably married.
Perhaps not.

393
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:20,316
She may have other children.
She might be dead.

394
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:23,025
She may even be in Australia or somewhere.
We just don't know.

395
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:24,691
But what we do know is...

396
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:27,108
That at the time she
gave you up for adoption,

397
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:31,275
she was under the impression that she
would probably never see you again.

398
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:35,358
Now, as I know you're very well aware,
the law has changed since then...

399
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:38,900
And you are now legally entitled
to seek your birth mother out.

400
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,907
But the snag is...

401
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:44,324
She might not want to see you.

402
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:50,816
So, I don't want you to raise
your hopes too high at this stage.

403
00:24:50,916 --> 00:24:53,199
- Sure.
- Okay?

404
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,365
Have a look at this.

405
00:24:56,041 --> 00:24:57,949
What is it?

406
00:24:58,208 --> 00:25:00,115
It's all about you.

407
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,490
I'll tell you what.

408
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:08,775
I'll leave it with you

409
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:10,816
- and I'll pop back in a few minutes.
- Yeah.

410
00:25:10,916 --> 00:25:13,782
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thank you.

411
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:27,699
How are you doing? All right?

412
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:37,990
Thank you.

413
00:26:48,166 --> 00:26:52,115
Cynthia Rose Purley, that's her?

414
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:56,733
Cynthia Rose.

415
00:26:56,833 --> 00:26:59,282
It's a nice name, isn't it?

416
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:03,199
That's her signature?

417
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:06,115
That feel strange?

418
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:12,615
Elizabeth, that's my middle name.

419
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:14,733
They must have kept it.

420
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:19,449
Well, that would be your birth name, you see?
Elizabeth Purley.

421
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:30,441
Listen, is there any way
I could get a copy of these?

422
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:33,400
No, those are the originals
and they're yours to keep.

423
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:37,532
That's your right under the 1975 Act.
I've made copies upstairs.

424
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:45,990
Shall I pop those in here for you?

425
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,574
So...

426
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:54,490
What we need to do now is...

427
00:27:55,958 --> 00:27:59,157
You go away and have a think.

428
00:28:00,708 --> 00:28:04,733
And, when the time's right, and not before,
you know, it's very much in your own time,

429
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:10,365
come back to me if that's what you want.
And we'll get the ball rolling.

430
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:16,441
Now it can be a very long-winded process
and there's no two ways about it.

431
00:28:16,541 --> 00:28:19,532
It's a very traumatic journey
we're embarking on.

432
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:25,074
And there may be other
people's feelings to consider, too.

433
00:28:26,416 --> 00:28:28,824
So, I'll wait to hear from you. Okay?

434
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:35,900
You, you could decide
to trace your birth mother by yourself,

435
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,983
if you wanted, but I wouldn't advise it.

436
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:39,775
We're a professional service.

437
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:42,365
And we know how to handle these things.

438
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,615
So, I think you should
take advantage of us.

439
00:28:56,375 --> 00:28:58,358
- Hello.
- Oh, you're back, hello.

440
00:28:58,458 --> 00:29:00,066
- I think I've found a mistake.
- I'm sorry, Hortense,

441
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:02,275
- I can't stop. I'm really in a hurry.
- Look, it says she's white.

442
00:29:02,375 --> 00:29:03,483
Sorry?

443
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:05,108
"Mother, white".

444
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:08,907
Well, it's perfectly feasible
that your mother was white, isn't it?

445
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:12,275
Look, I'm, I'm sorry, Hortense,
really, I've got to go.

446
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,691
I'm on an emergency case.

447
00:29:13,791 --> 00:29:16,282
Yes, but could this be a mistake?

448
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:18,858
I very much doubt it.

449
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:23,949
Look, give me a ring in the morning,
and we'll have a talk then. Okay, I'm sorry.

450
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:31,608
Look at that.

451
00:29:31,708 --> 00:29:34,275
- Legs like a teenager!
- Do you have to?

452
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:37,608
- You'd like a pair like that.
- What for?

453
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:39,865
I'm known for my legs.

454
00:29:40,208 --> 00:29:42,650
If you got it, flaunt it.

455
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,775
Are you going out?

456
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:45,615
'Course I ain't.

457
00:29:47,791 --> 00:29:49,025
Who's that?

458
00:29:49,125 --> 00:29:51,074
I don't know.

459
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:54,400
If it's what's-her-name
you could ask her to come in.

460
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,699
I don't even know who it is yet.

461
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,150
What are you doing here?

462
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,150
Just come to see you.

463
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,074
Well, you can't come in, my mum's here.

464
00:30:05,458 --> 00:30:08,074
- Who is it?
- I'm going out.

465
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:11,949
Hello.

466
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,858
You all right, sweetheart?

467
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:18,949
Would you get inside?

468
00:30:31,416 --> 00:30:33,990
- Nothing's changed much.
- No.

469
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:37,074
Ain't your mum been
round looking after you?

470
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:39,775
She came round Sunday after mass.

471
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:41,525
Didn't take you long
to mess it up again.

472
00:30:41,625 --> 00:30:43,233
She's laying off me a bit now, though.

473
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:45,900
- I should think so too at your age.
- Yeah.

474
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,157
She should have a word with my mum.

475
00:30:48,666 --> 00:30:50,657
I'll bet she misses you, though.

476
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:55,733
Fucking do without it altogether,
I tell you.

477
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:57,566
Yeah, I know what you mean.

478
00:30:57,666 --> 00:31:00,449
You and me, mate,
we're better off without them.

479
00:31:02,708 --> 00:31:07,316
Look, I'm sorry about, you know?

480
00:31:07,416 --> 00:31:09,449
So you should be.

481
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:13,650
Don't get all serious on me, Paul.

482
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:16,657
- No, no, I ain't.
- Yes, you are, you fool.

483
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,574
Just missed you.

484
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:22,657
How much?

485
00:31:23,125 --> 00:31:24,316
A lot.

486
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:27,199
- Just a lot?
- No... Yeah.

487
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:29,907
Well, I might've missed you a bit.

488
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:33,900
No. I've been going outta me head.

489
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,199
Same as that.

490
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:57,483
Just so's you know, I ain't staying the night,
not every time I come round.

491
00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:02,191
And I weren't in a strop before.
I was just speakin' my mind, all right?

492
00:32:02,291 --> 00:32:04,199
Now give us a snog.

493
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:03,150
- Hello. Good afternoon.
- Hello.

494
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,358
Thank you very much indeed.
Right, that's fine.

495
00:34:05,458 --> 00:34:07,816
- Is that a post or collect?
- Collect, please.

496
00:34:07,916 --> 00:34:09,983
Thanks very much.
That's £6, please, madam.

497
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:12,615
£6, okay.

498
00:34:25,708 --> 00:34:27,275
I saw her, you know.

499
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:29,365
- Did ya?
- Yeah.

500
00:34:29,791 --> 00:34:33,150
8:00 in the morning, she's down Harlesden
buying her yam and banana...

501
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:35,691
And she's like,
"You got a boyfriend yet, Dionne?"

502
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:39,691
Nearly everyone who went to
the funeral reckoned they'd seen her

503
00:34:39,791 --> 00:34:42,108
and she'd given them some kinda sign.

504
00:34:42,208 --> 00:34:44,941
"Me see you mother
two days before she dead.

505
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:49,608
"And she hold onto me hand
and look in me eye, as if she did know."

506
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,615
I mean, if she knew,
I wish she'd told us.

507
00:34:59,708 --> 00:35:01,615
You're getting better, though.

508
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:04,740
It's a nice day.

509
00:35:05,958 --> 00:35:07,824
Yeah.

510
00:35:11,791 --> 00:35:15,150
I dunno, my head can't contain it all.

511
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,191
It's too soon.

512
00:35:18,958 --> 00:35:21,615
There's nothing rational about grief.

513
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:26,074
Maybe you're crying for yourself.

514
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:29,157
- You been out much?
- No, I can't.

515
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:34,949
Some days I'm completely vulnerable.

516
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:37,150
I can feel everything.

517
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,566
Other days I'm numb.

518
00:35:39,666 --> 00:35:42,074
- Well d'you want to come out with me?
- No.

519
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:47,157
- I got stuff to sort out.
- What?

520
00:35:47,916 --> 00:35:49,740
Life.

521
00:35:51,791 --> 00:35:53,150
Look, if there's anything I can do...

522
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:57,324
No, thanks, I'll be all right.

523
00:35:58,333 --> 00:35:59,483
Have you heard from Bernard?

524
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:00,900
No.

525
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,199
Yes.

526
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:04,733
He sent a sympathy card.

527
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:07,782
Which I thought was
a very nice thing to do.

528
00:36:15,291 --> 00:36:16,733
I did something really bad.

529
00:36:16,833 --> 00:36:19,650
Oh, no, I don't think
I can deal with no confession.

530
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,108
Cleanse my soul.

531
00:36:21,208 --> 00:36:22,733
I did the do.

532
00:36:22,833 --> 00:36:25,025
- Do it.
- Did the deed.

533
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:27,108
- Did it.
- With a complete stranger.

534
00:36:27,208 --> 00:36:29,233
- No, who?
- Dunno.

535
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:30,941
Well, what'd he look like?

536
00:36:31,041 --> 00:36:33,108
Dunno. He was in advertising.

537
00:36:33,208 --> 00:36:35,316
Oh, Lord!

538
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:39,275
- Did you use a condom?
- Yes.

539
00:36:39,375 --> 00:36:41,566
Did you use two?

540
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:42,900
Yes.

541
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,566
One on top of the other?

542
00:36:44,666 --> 00:36:46,025
One after the other.

543
00:36:46,125 --> 00:36:48,152
Oh, God!

544
00:36:48,825 --> 00:36:50,865
Do you despair of me?

545
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:53,025
- No.
- Yes, you do.

546
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:55,733
I don't. Did you have a good time?

547
00:36:55,833 --> 00:36:57,066
Yeah.

548
00:36:57,166 --> 00:36:59,657
- That's all that matters then, innit?
- Yeah.

549
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:07,025
I liked my mum as a person,
but I didn't know her.

550
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:08,775
I wish I'd known her.

551
00:37:08,875 --> 00:37:10,483
She loved you.

552
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:12,907
Yeah, I know,
but that's not in debate, is it?

553
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:17,949
My mum, she resents me.

554
00:37:18,416 --> 00:37:20,240
She kept you.

555
00:37:21,708 --> 00:37:24,240
She fed you, and she clothed you.

556
00:37:25,083 --> 00:37:29,483
She didn't give you away. She could've.

557
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:32,032
- I wish she had.
- No, you don't.

558
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:37,949
The thing is they're so secretive.

559
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:40,233
It's that "back home" thing, you know.

560
00:37:40,333 --> 00:37:42,483
Come out, big people are talking.

561
00:37:42,583 --> 00:37:44,574
That sort of vibe.

562
00:37:44,875 --> 00:37:49,191
So, you don't pursue things
because you're brought up not to.

563
00:37:49,291 --> 00:37:51,740
I just let 'em get on with it.

564
00:37:55,166 --> 00:37:59,691
All I seem to do is think about
things I wish I could've asked her.

565
00:37:59,791 --> 00:38:01,324
Like what?

566
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:05,615
I dunno.

567
00:38:07,166 --> 00:38:09,233
There's stuff I wish I knew.

568
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:11,782
- There's stuff I wish I didn't know.
- No.

569
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:17,066
If you knew you had a limited
amount of time, you'd sort it out.

570
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:19,691
You'd ask your mum questions

571
00:38:19,791 --> 00:38:22,316
regardless of whether she got vexed.

572
00:38:22,416 --> 00:38:26,824
Like, I don't know. What happened
between her and your dad, for example.

573
00:38:26,958 --> 00:38:28,191
No.

574
00:38:28,291 --> 00:38:31,858
She hasn't made no effort for me,
so why should I be interested in her?

575
00:38:31,958 --> 00:38:34,108
And where's my dad, anyway?

576
00:38:34,208 --> 00:38:36,650
I don't want to hear her
and Norbert having it off.

577
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:39,358
I don't want her to know
who I'm having it off with.

578
00:38:39,458 --> 00:38:41,775
And I don't want her to see me drunk.

579
00:38:41,875 --> 00:38:44,115
I don't want her to know
nothing about me.

580
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:46,566
Maybe that's because you're
frightened that

581
00:38:46,666 --> 00:38:49,775
when you look at her
you can see yourself in 20 years' time.

582
00:38:49,875 --> 00:38:51,358
Please.

583
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:53,365
We choose our parents.

584
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:55,983
How do you mean?

585
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:58,733
We choose the parents in this life,

586
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:00,816
that can teach us something.

587
00:39:00,916 --> 00:39:04,240
So, that when we go
into the next life we get it right.

588
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:10,365
'Course, sometimes it
don't work, does it?

589
00:39:15,416 --> 00:39:17,108
I'm gonna pop out for a couple of hours.

590
00:39:17,208 --> 00:39:19,400
- What time will you be back?
- 4:30.

591
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,824
- Okay, have fun.
- Thanks.

592
00:39:23,916 --> 00:39:26,525
Sorry to interrupt. Could you get me
a few of these things in?

593
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:28,650
- Right.
- I'm a bit low.

594
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,407
I'll give them a ring.

595
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:15,824
17.

596
00:41:19,166 --> 00:41:20,400
Hello.

597
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,365
Bloody hell!

598
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,775
What you doing here?

599
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:26,324
Thought I'd come and see you.

600
00:41:26,833 --> 00:41:28,324
Where's Monica?

601
00:41:29,916 --> 00:41:32,003
She's at home, I think.

602
00:41:33,098 --> 00:41:36,115
- You gonna let me in then?
- Yeah, of course.

603
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:42,275
D'you want a cup of tea?

604
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:43,740
Yes, please.

605
00:41:46,916 --> 00:41:48,108
You all right, then?

606
00:41:48,208 --> 00:41:49,532
Smashing.

607
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:51,900
You been working down this way?

608
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,740
Yeah, round the back of Tower Bridge.

609
00:41:54,916 --> 00:41:57,691
If I'd known you was comin'
I'd have warmed up the seat.

610
00:41:57,791 --> 00:41:59,490
Warm enough, I should think.

611
00:42:08,708 --> 00:42:11,199
Does Monica know you've come round here?

612
00:42:11,458 --> 00:42:13,532
No. I didn't know I was comin' meself.

613
00:42:14,791 --> 00:42:16,191
She's okay, then?

614
00:42:16,291 --> 00:42:17,824
Yeah, she's fine.

615
00:42:19,875 --> 00:42:21,449
Been busy with the house.

616
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:23,865
What doing?

617
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,733
I thought it was supposed
to be a new house, you said.

618
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:28,324
Stencilling.

619
00:42:28,916 --> 00:42:30,275
What, drawing?

620
00:42:30,375 --> 00:42:31,740
No.

621
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:33,990
Stencils. On the wall.

622
00:42:34,625 --> 00:42:37,699
Decorating.
You must've seen it in magazines.

623
00:42:38,875 --> 00:42:40,324
It's very effective.

624
00:42:44,333 --> 00:42:46,032
Roxanne not in, then?

625
00:42:47,625 --> 00:42:49,733
She's got some bloke in tow.

626
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:50,983
Has she?

627
00:42:51,083 --> 00:42:52,983
Shifty-lookin' bleeder.

628
00:42:53,083 --> 00:42:55,330
Walks like a crab.

629
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:57,233
- Your tea's there.
- Ta.

630
00:42:57,333 --> 00:42:58,733
D'you want a sandwich?

631
00:42:58,833 --> 00:43:00,282
No, thanks.

632
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,566
Is that all you're havin'?

633
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:03,525
I only see her first thing
in the morning.

634
00:43:03,625 --> 00:43:06,407
She comes in, grunts,
then buggers off to work.

635
00:43:06,791 --> 00:43:08,407
You should be glad she's got a fella.

636
00:43:08,625 --> 00:43:10,191
I am glad, Maurice.

637
00:43:10,291 --> 00:43:11,782
I want her to be happy.

638
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:16,025
But I'd like her to bring him round,
see who she's knocking about with.

639
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:17,275
Just give her a bit of time.

640
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,449
You used to bring your girlfriends home.

641
00:43:19,666 --> 00:43:22,199
Front of the telly. Laugh, drink.

642
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:24,824
You didn't mind me
sittin' there, did you?

643
00:43:26,541 --> 00:43:29,199
What's her name? Never stopped talkin'.

644
00:43:29,375 --> 00:43:30,990
- Tina.
- Tina.

645
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,865
Then the other one wouldn't
open her mouth.

646
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:38,108
- Maxine.
- That's it.

647
00:43:38,208 --> 00:43:40,115
Dad liked her, didn't he?

648
00:43:41,291 --> 00:43:42,949
Nice thighs.

649
00:43:44,666 --> 00:43:46,240
So, how's work, then?

650
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,740
- Still at the same place?
- Yeah.

651
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,525
I gotta get her something
for her birthday.

652
00:43:53,625 --> 00:43:55,275
It's her 21 st, Maurice.

653
00:43:55,375 --> 00:43:57,740
- August the 7th.
- I dunno what she wants.

654
00:43:58,833 --> 00:44:00,441
Apart from me under a bus.

655
00:44:00,541 --> 00:44:01,775
That's silly talk.

656
00:44:01,875 --> 00:44:03,282
Me head in the oven.

657
00:44:05,083 --> 00:44:06,865
When are you gonna come
and see us, then?

658
00:44:08,625 --> 00:44:10,324
You know, have a bit of a get-together.

659
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:12,816
Come on Roxanne's birthday.
We'll have some champagne.

660
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:14,191
What about Monica?

661
00:44:14,291 --> 00:44:16,066
Yeah. She'll be there.

662
00:44:16,166 --> 00:44:18,032
Won't she mind?

663
00:44:18,916 --> 00:44:21,941
No, it was her idea, actually.

664
00:44:23,583 --> 00:44:26,316
- How'd you fancy a barbecue?
- If you like.

665
00:44:26,416 --> 00:44:28,324
Anyway, it's about time
you saw the house.

666
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:29,941
Thought you was never going to ask.

667
00:44:30,041 --> 00:44:32,775
- Well, I'm asking you now.
- You been there nearly a twelvemonth.

668
00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:34,525
Tell Roxanne.

669
00:44:34,625 --> 00:44:36,240
She might not want to come.

670
00:44:36,625 --> 00:44:38,733
She'll say no just to spite me.

671
00:44:38,833 --> 00:44:41,608
Yeah, well, I demand her presence.
Tell her.

672
00:44:41,708 --> 00:44:43,240
What if she wants to bring him?

673
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,400
Has he got a job, this bloke?

674
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:50,199
- Scaffolding, she says.
- Oh.

675
00:44:51,666 --> 00:44:53,157
It's very well paid.

676
00:44:53,916 --> 00:44:55,990
- Is it?
- Yeah.

677
00:45:00,791 --> 00:45:02,490
21.

678
00:45:04,416 --> 00:45:06,532
I can't believe it, Maurice.

679
00:45:07,166 --> 00:45:10,365
I was carrying her
when I was 21, wasn't I?

680
00:45:13,666 --> 00:45:15,275
You was good with nappies.

681
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,066
Those safety pins, though.

682
00:45:19,166 --> 00:45:20,983
Never stabbed her though,
did you, darling?

683
00:45:21,083 --> 00:45:22,733
Stabbed meself a couple of times.

684
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:24,615
17, weren't you?

685
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,324
I was.

686
00:45:59,375 --> 00:46:01,074
Place is still standing, then?

687
00:46:01,583 --> 00:46:04,733
Not for much longer.
You should see Dad's room.

688
00:46:04,833 --> 00:46:05,858
What's up with it?

689
00:46:05,958 --> 00:46:07,983
It's like the Niagara Falls up there.

690
00:46:08,083 --> 00:46:10,324
- What's it got, a leak?
- Yeah.

691
00:46:10,791 --> 00:46:12,449
Only when it's raining.

692
00:46:13,333 --> 00:46:14,865
I'll have a look.

693
00:46:18,416 --> 00:46:20,907
Nice to have a man about the place.

694
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:28,074
I wish I'd known you was coming.

695
00:46:39,166 --> 00:46:40,865
It's dry at the moment.

696
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:43,657
The whole lot's gonna come down.

697
00:46:45,958 --> 00:46:49,199
Yeah, it does look a bit dodgy,
I'll have to admit.

698
00:46:50,291 --> 00:46:52,441
- Are you up to date on the rent?
- 'Course I am.

699
00:46:52,541 --> 00:46:54,316
Well, give him a ring.
Get him to do something about it.

700
00:46:54,416 --> 00:46:56,441
- It's his responsibility.
- Don't be daft, Maurice.

701
00:46:56,541 --> 00:46:58,900
He don't give a toss, does he?

702
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,650
Well, get someone to look at it.

703
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:02,282
I'll pay.

704
00:47:06,125 --> 00:47:07,824
Look at all this junk!

705
00:47:09,583 --> 00:47:11,199
What're you gonna do with it?

706
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:21,574
Give us a cuddle, Maurice.

707
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:26,400
Please, sweetheart.

708
00:47:34,166 --> 00:47:38,574
Why have you left it so bloody long?

709
00:47:40,875 --> 00:47:42,949
Well, you know, it's, it's work and...

710
00:47:43,458 --> 00:47:46,900
Well, there's nothing the matter
with your dialling finger.

711
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,025
Well, you can ring me.

712
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:51,615
You're always too busy, ain't ya?

713
00:47:56,708 --> 00:47:58,608
Look, look...

714
00:47:58,708 --> 00:48:00,358
Look, sit, sit yourself down.

715
00:48:00,458 --> 00:48:03,490
You're the only one I've got, Maurice.

716
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:12,074
You love me, don't you?

717
00:48:14,916 --> 00:48:18,615
Hold me tight, Maurice, please.

718
00:48:21,208 --> 00:48:25,615
Sweetheart.

719
00:48:51,458 --> 00:48:53,115
My little brother.

720
00:48:57,291 --> 00:48:59,074
Look at you.

721
00:49:01,583 --> 00:49:03,740
That's the good life for you.

722
00:49:11,291 --> 00:49:13,199
When are you gonna shave?

723
00:49:15,125 --> 00:49:17,115
Slap your arse.

724
00:49:25,958 --> 00:49:27,949
Why don't you chuck it all out?

725
00:49:30,541 --> 00:49:32,240
I mean, look at it.

726
00:49:36,916 --> 00:49:39,733
Some of it hasn't been touched
since Mum died.

727
00:49:39,833 --> 00:49:42,740
Can you use anything, Maurice,
in your new house?

728
00:49:44,041 --> 00:49:45,574
Fill a space?

729
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:48,199
No, thanks.

730
00:49:49,666 --> 00:49:51,490
Thought I might move in 'ere.

731
00:49:52,041 --> 00:49:53,657
Front view.

732
00:49:54,125 --> 00:49:56,032
See the world go by.

733
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:05,574
Remember this?

734
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,990
Yeah.

735
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,824
That's no use to you, is it?

736
00:50:14,125 --> 00:50:15,699
I don't think so.

737
00:50:16,833 --> 00:50:20,240
You ain't gonna
make me an auntie now, are you?

738
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,115
Sweetheart.

739
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:31,907
Listen, Cynth...

740
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:45,074
I'd better... Better be going.

741
00:50:58,333 --> 00:51:01,191
You'll let me know about the barbecue, then,
will you, sweetheart?

742
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:02,441
Yeah, of course I will.

743
00:51:02,541 --> 00:51:04,358
Tell her, if she can't make it,
I'll give her a clump.

744
00:51:04,458 --> 00:51:06,233
Yeah, not before I do.

745
00:51:06,333 --> 00:51:07,657
Hang on.

746
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:16,483
Shall I say hello to Monica for you?

747
00:51:16,583 --> 00:51:18,782
If you like, sweetheart.

748
00:51:20,625 --> 00:51:22,740
- There you go.
- Thanks, darling.

749
00:51:27,875 --> 00:51:29,025
See you.

750
00:51:29,125 --> 00:51:30,365
Ta-ta.

751
00:51:55,916 --> 00:51:57,949
What was your Mum like
when your dad died?

752
00:51:58,916 --> 00:52:00,191
What do you mean?

753
00:52:00,291 --> 00:52:01,441
How did she cope?

754
00:52:01,541 --> 00:52:02,949
I don't know.

755
00:52:03,166 --> 00:52:04,824
Too young to remember.

756
00:52:06,541 --> 00:52:09,199
She just got on with it, I suppose,
like everybody else.

757
00:52:09,791 --> 00:52:11,365
Did you have to look after Craig?

758
00:52:12,541 --> 00:52:15,449
What, you mean
like your big sister looked after you?

759
00:52:15,916 --> 00:52:17,532
No, I did not.

760
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:23,490
My dad never said a word
about my mum after she died.

761
00:52:23,916 --> 00:52:25,615
That's men for you.

762
00:52:25,833 --> 00:52:27,407
I hated him for it.

763
00:52:30,541 --> 00:52:32,740
He must've been in real pain.

764
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:38,074
Maybe he just couldn't share it.

765
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:45,990
I didn't know what I felt.

766
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,240
I still don't.

767
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:58,324
Cynthia's antics
couldn't have helped him much.

768
00:53:01,041 --> 00:53:02,490
Do you miss Craig?

769
00:53:02,791 --> 00:53:03,941
Why would I miss Craig?

770
00:53:04,041 --> 00:53:05,108
Well, he's your brother.

771
00:53:05,208 --> 00:53:07,699
- He's in Saudi Arabia, isn't he?
- Yeah.

772
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:13,282
Well, I don't exactly miss him.

773
00:53:15,708 --> 00:53:18,157
Why? Do you miss Cynthia?

774
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:26,316
Do you think Roxanne's serious
about this scaffolder bloke?

775
00:53:26,416 --> 00:53:28,233
Oh, she's only known him
for five minutes.

776
00:53:28,333 --> 00:53:31,240
Mind you, I was married
at her age, wasn't I?

777
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,775
Yeah.

778
00:53:33,875 --> 00:53:35,525
I wonder if she knows.

779
00:53:35,625 --> 00:53:37,032
What, about us?

780
00:53:38,083 --> 00:53:40,025
What is there to know about us?

781
00:53:40,125 --> 00:53:41,699
You know what I mean.

782
00:53:44,916 --> 00:53:47,441
How would she know about that
unless you've told her.

783
00:53:47,541 --> 00:53:48,865
I haven't told her.

784
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:50,775
I hope Cynthia doesn't know, either.

785
00:53:50,875 --> 00:53:52,191
She doesn't.

786
00:53:52,291 --> 00:53:53,782
That's all right then.

787
00:53:57,291 --> 00:54:00,358
No, I meant, if she knows about Cynthia.

788
00:54:00,458 --> 00:54:02,400
Y'know, before she was born.

789
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:03,949
I don't know.

790
00:54:05,916 --> 00:54:06,858
I don't know.

791
00:54:06,958 --> 00:54:09,525
I mean, she's got a half-brother or
half-sister knocking about somewhere.

792
00:54:09,625 --> 00:54:10,816
She's got a right to know.

793
00:54:10,916 --> 00:54:12,407
That's up to Cynthia.

794
00:54:14,541 --> 00:54:16,115
You'd never say anything, would you?

795
00:54:18,416 --> 00:54:19,858
Of course not.

796
00:54:19,958 --> 00:54:21,157
Good.

797
00:54:22,958 --> 00:54:24,615
Anyway, she must've told her.

798
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:27,782
She never told her who her father was.

799
00:54:28,208 --> 00:54:29,907
None of us knew who he was.

800
00:54:32,083 --> 00:54:33,483
I wonder if she ever misses him.

801
00:54:33,583 --> 00:54:35,324
- Who?
- Roxanne.

802
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:37,525
You can't miss what you've never had.

803
00:54:37,625 --> 00:54:39,074
Can't you?

804
00:54:47,625 --> 00:54:49,157
I was gonna kill him.

805
00:54:53,625 --> 00:54:56,532
- Poor Cynthia.
- Saint Cynthia.

806
00:55:00,416 --> 00:55:01,483
She tried her best.

807
00:55:01,583 --> 00:55:03,115
- Did she?
- Yeah.

808
00:55:04,666 --> 00:55:06,157
Yeah.

809
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:07,740
She did.

810
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,615
She gave me a lot of love.

811
00:55:54,833 --> 00:55:56,858
What shall I tell him
if he phones, then?

812
00:55:56,958 --> 00:55:58,108
- Who?
- Maurice.

813
00:55:58,208 --> 00:55:59,733
I don't know. Tell him what you want.

814
00:55:59,833 --> 00:56:02,358
- Are you gonna bring your bloke or not?
- No, I ain't.

815
00:56:02,458 --> 00:56:05,025
- Have you asked him?
- No.

816
00:56:05,125 --> 00:56:07,365
- Hello?
- That'll be 'im now.

817
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,650
- Hello?
- Let me talk to 'im.

818
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:11,157
Shut it!

819
00:56:11,958 --> 00:56:13,449
Well, there ain't no one there.

820
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:15,858
Be one of them perverts.

821
00:56:15,958 --> 00:56:17,233
- Sweetheart...
- Mum, will you stop

822
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:19,025
going on about this fuckin' barbecue.

823
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:21,483
You're going to see him now, ain't you?
You could ask him.

824
00:56:21,583 --> 00:56:24,907
I don't even know if I want him to go
and it ain't for ages anyway.

825
00:56:25,583 --> 00:56:27,240
See you later.

826
00:56:27,833 --> 00:56:30,066
- I, Zoe...
- I, Zoe...

827
00:56:30,166 --> 00:56:33,275
- Take you, Darren...
- Take you, Darren...

828
00:56:33,375 --> 00:56:34,650
To be my husband...

829
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:35,775
To be my husband...

830
00:56:35,875 --> 00:56:37,108
To have and to hold...

831
00:56:37,208 --> 00:56:38,233
To have and to hold...

832
00:56:38,333 --> 00:56:39,566
From this day forward...

833
00:56:39,666 --> 00:56:40,900
From this day forward...

834
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,025
For better, for worse...

835
00:56:42,125 --> 00:56:43,150
For better, for worse...

836
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:45,691
- For richer, for poorer...
- For richer, for poorer...

837
00:56:45,791 --> 00:56:47,782
In sickness and in health...

838
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:05,566
Darren and Zoe have given their consent

839
00:57:05,666 --> 00:57:08,490
and made their marriage vows
to each other.

840
00:57:09,041 --> 00:57:12,233
They, have declared their marriage
by joining of hands

841
00:57:12,333 --> 00:57:14,990
and by the giving
and receiving of rings.

842
00:57:15,125 --> 00:57:21,074
I therefore proclaim that
they are husband and wife.

843
00:57:29,125 --> 00:57:31,275
Ain't you seeing him tonight, then?

844
00:57:31,375 --> 00:57:33,199
I'm having an early night.

845
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:35,400
Keep me company?

846
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:36,907
I've got hangover.

847
00:57:38,125 --> 00:57:40,282
You should stop in more often.

848
00:57:43,916 --> 00:57:47,066
You are lookin' after yourself with him,
ain't you, sweetheart?

849
00:57:47,166 --> 00:57:48,233
What d'you mean?

850
00:57:48,333 --> 00:57:50,199
You know, taking care.

851
00:57:52,375 --> 00:57:54,865
I don't want to ask you nothing
personal, darling, but...

852
00:57:55,541 --> 00:57:56,775
Are you taking the pill?

853
00:57:56,875 --> 00:57:58,532
That is personal.

854
00:58:00,041 --> 00:58:02,650
- Why don't you bring him round?
- Leave it out.

855
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:05,983
I'd like to meet him. I wouldn't know him
if he stood up in me soup.

856
00:58:06,083 --> 00:58:07,191
Don't hold your breath.

857
00:58:07,291 --> 00:58:09,150
You don't want to leave it up
to him, darling.

858
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:11,240
- Men are all the same.
- Mum!

859
00:58:11,416 --> 00:58:13,490
I hope he uses a what's-name...

860
00:58:13,625 --> 00:58:14,608
Condoms.

861
00:58:14,708 --> 00:58:16,150
Mind your own business!

862
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:17,483
They can leak.

863
00:58:17,583 --> 00:58:19,282
You wanna be careful.

864
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:21,199
You're jealous, ain't ya?

865
00:58:21,875 --> 00:58:24,316
- Where is he tonight, anyway?
- I dunno.

866
00:58:24,416 --> 00:58:26,907
Most likely out giving
somebody else one.

867
00:58:27,375 --> 00:58:29,358
That's how I got caught with you.

868
00:58:29,458 --> 00:58:30,990
Running out of the pill.

869
00:58:31,458 --> 00:58:32,983
You could have a coil fitted.

870
00:58:33,083 --> 00:58:34,983
- Change the record.
- Dr Mulholland

871
00:58:35,083 --> 00:58:36,483
make an appointment.

872
00:58:36,583 --> 00:58:38,775
- You'd suit the sponge.
- Keep your voice down.

873
00:58:38,875 --> 00:58:42,775
I've got a Dutch cap floating around
somewhere upstairs. You could have that.

874
00:58:42,875 --> 00:58:45,316
Run it under the tap.
Bit of talcum powder.

875
00:58:45,416 --> 00:58:47,865
- Where are you going?
- I don't have to listen to this.

876
00:58:48,375 --> 00:58:50,240
Sweetheart...

877
00:58:52,041 --> 00:58:53,449
Roxanne.

878
00:58:54,166 --> 00:58:57,316
Sweetheart, darling...
I'm only trying to help you.

879
00:58:57,416 --> 00:58:58,691
Leave me alone.

880
00:58:58,791 --> 00:59:01,108
- I'm your mother.
- Get out of my room!

881
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:04,275
It don't matter if you have a little baby.
I'll look after it.

882
00:59:04,375 --> 00:59:06,900
- I ain't gettin' pregnant.
- I'll give up me job.

883
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,532
It's nothing to do with you!

884
00:59:08,833 --> 00:59:12,150
Yes, it bloody is! I'm not having you
dropping it in my door!

885
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:13,608
Jesus Christ!

886
00:59:13,708 --> 00:59:15,983
- I'm sorry, darling. I didn't mean...
- Fuck off!

887
00:59:16,083 --> 00:59:18,532
You make me sick, you stupid bitch!

888
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:19,483
Hello.

889
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:21,907
I'm sorry to trouble you, but...

890
01:00:22,458 --> 01:00:26,532
I'm trying to locate a Cynthia Purley.

891
01:00:26,958 --> 01:00:28,449
Yes?

892
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,657
Is that Cynthia Purley?

893
01:00:32,041 --> 01:00:33,365
Yes.

894
01:00:33,708 --> 01:00:35,490
Cynthia Rose Purley?

895
01:00:35,791 --> 01:00:36,941
Yes.

896
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:39,074
Of 76 Quilter Street?

897
01:00:39,375 --> 01:00:41,949
Yes. What is it you want, darling?

898
01:00:43,958 --> 01:00:45,324
Hello?

899
01:00:46,666 --> 01:00:48,233
Did you want Roxanne?

900
01:00:48,333 --> 01:00:49,400
She's gone out.

901
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:52,282
- No.
- She ain't in any trouble, is she?

902
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,941
No. It's about Elizabeth.

903
01:00:55,041 --> 01:00:57,074
Elizabeth. Elizabeth who?

904
01:00:57,666 --> 01:00:59,282
Elizabeth Purley.

905
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,615
But she's dead.

906
01:01:05,875 --> 01:01:08,400
- No, she isn't.
- She is, darling,

907
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:09,733
I should know.

908
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,240
Well, I should know.

909
01:01:11,416 --> 01:01:13,233
Look, sweetheart. She's me mother.

910
01:01:13,333 --> 01:01:15,566
She went in 1961.

911
01:01:15,666 --> 01:01:19,032
No, I mean baby Elizabeth Purley.

912
01:01:19,458 --> 01:01:21,240
Baby Eliz...

913
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:26,282
Who is this?

914
01:01:27,208 --> 01:01:30,907
She was born on the 23rd of July, 1968.

915
01:01:32,208 --> 01:01:34,532
At... Sorry about this...

916
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:43,407
Yeah. At the Haven,
Wells Grange Avenue, Sutton, Surrey.

917
01:01:47,416 --> 01:01:49,907
Look, I'm sorry I know
this must be a shock to you.

918
01:02:56,041 --> 01:02:58,483
Listen, darling, what is it you want?

919
01:02:58,583 --> 01:02:59,858
I'm really sorry.

920
01:02:59,958 --> 01:03:02,907
You mustn't come round here, sweetheart.

921
01:03:04,708 --> 01:03:06,191
I didn't want to upset you.

922
01:03:06,291 --> 01:03:08,233
You mustn't do that.

923
01:03:08,333 --> 01:03:10,566
And you mustn't phone, neither.

924
01:03:10,666 --> 01:03:12,033
I just needed to know.

925
01:03:12,133 --> 01:03:16,483
Yes, but you can't come round here
'cause no-one knows about you, see?

926
01:03:16,583 --> 01:03:17,691
Right.

927
01:03:17,791 --> 01:03:20,566
Promise me you won't come round.
Promise me.

928
01:03:20,666 --> 01:03:21,990
Look...

929
01:03:22,375 --> 01:03:23,983
I've got your address.
If I wanted to come round,

930
01:03:24,083 --> 01:03:27,574
- I'd have done it already.
- I'm ever so sorry, sweetheart.

931
01:03:28,916 --> 01:03:31,615
I'm a little bit upset.

932
01:03:33,708 --> 01:03:36,066
Promise me you won't come round?

933
01:03:36,166 --> 01:03:37,608
All right, I promise.

934
01:03:37,708 --> 01:03:39,324
Thank you.

935
01:03:42,166 --> 01:03:43,824
Thank you.

936
01:03:47,666 --> 01:03:49,490
Can I meet you somewhere?

937
01:03:50,541 --> 01:03:52,775
Oh, I shouldn't think so, darling.

938
01:03:52,875 --> 01:03:55,191
See, I've got lots of...

939
01:03:55,291 --> 01:03:57,566
I've got lots of questions
I want to ask you.

940
01:03:57,666 --> 01:04:00,025
Yeah, well I gotta go now.

941
01:04:00,125 --> 01:04:01,324
Please...

942
01:04:09,125 --> 01:04:11,199
What's your name, anyway?

943
01:04:13,083 --> 01:04:15,949
- Hortense.
- Hortense?

944
01:04:16,166 --> 01:04:17,733
Yeah.

945
01:04:17,833 --> 01:04:19,650
Hortense what?

946
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:20,858
Cumberbatch.

947
01:04:20,958 --> 01:04:22,441
Clumberbunch?

948
01:04:22,541 --> 01:04:24,615
That's a funny name, innit?

949
01:04:25,125 --> 01:04:26,824
Yeah, I suppose it is.

950
01:04:30,583 --> 01:04:32,115
Are you on the phone?

951
01:04:32,708 --> 01:04:35,282
Yeah do you want to take my number down?

952
01:04:35,416 --> 01:04:38,275
Oh, I don't think I've got a pencil.

953
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:39,782
I'll wait.

954
01:04:53,791 --> 01:04:55,324
I've got one.

955
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:59,407
It's 0171...

956
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:02,400
219...

957
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,699
Sorry, 619...

958
01:05:05,708 --> 01:05:07,490
4840.

959
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,074
Yeah, ta-ta.

960
01:05:59,166 --> 01:06:00,365
Hello?

961
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:02,400
Hello?

962
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,358
Do you want to meet me or not, then?

963
01:06:04,458 --> 01:06:06,233
Oh, hello?

964
01:06:06,333 --> 01:06:08,316
Yes or no. It's up to you.

965
01:06:08,416 --> 01:06:11,150
Well, yeah, of course,
I want to meet you.

966
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:13,115
Well, then...

967
01:06:16,166 --> 01:06:17,865
Are you sure about this?

968
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:20,483
I mean, if you're not sure...

969
01:06:20,583 --> 01:06:22,490
Where do you want to meet me?

970
01:06:23,083 --> 01:06:24,816
Well, where would you like to meet?

971
01:06:24,916 --> 01:06:29,275
I don't know. Anywhere.
Not here, though.

972
01:06:29,375 --> 01:06:31,032
No, of course not.

973
01:06:31,458 --> 01:06:36,449
What about outside
Holborn Tube Station?

974
01:06:38,833 --> 01:06:40,490
Holborn.

975
01:06:41,850 --> 01:06:42,990
When?

976
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:46,066
What are you doing this Saturday coming?

977
01:06:46,166 --> 01:06:49,316
Nothing. I'm never bloody
doing anything.

978
01:06:49,416 --> 01:06:50,941
Saturday, then.

979
01:06:51,041 --> 01:06:52,324
What time?

980
01:06:53,041 --> 01:06:55,365
- 7:30?
- Half-past 7:00.

981
01:06:56,541 --> 01:06:59,858
Now, listen, you mustn't
phone me here again.

982
01:06:59,958 --> 01:07:01,816
Do you understand me?

983
01:07:01,916 --> 01:07:04,324
Otherwise, I won't come and meet you.

984
01:07:06,583 --> 01:07:09,615
Now, I'll see you on Saturday.

985
01:07:10,458 --> 01:07:11,657
Hello?

986
01:07:13,125 --> 01:07:15,282
Don't even know what you look like.

987
01:07:31,791 --> 01:07:33,566
- Hello, sweetheart.
- What's for tea?

988
01:07:33,666 --> 01:07:35,108
- Got you a bit of steak.
- What for?

989
01:07:35,208 --> 01:07:37,316
- Little treat for ya.
- Ain't you having none?

990
01:07:37,416 --> 01:07:39,483
Oh, I'll just fry myself an egg.
Do you want a beer?

991
01:07:39,583 --> 01:07:41,316
- We ain't got none.
- I got you some.

992
01:07:41,416 --> 01:07:43,115
Oh, did you?

993
01:07:43,458 --> 01:07:46,240
- Are you going out?
- No, I'm stayin' in.

994
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:57,449
I'm gonna have a few early nights.

995
01:07:58,625 --> 01:08:00,490
I've decided.

996
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:03,615
Excuse me.

997
01:09:03,958 --> 01:09:06,824
- Yeah, what is it, sweetheart?
- Are you Cynthia?

998
01:09:07,375 --> 01:09:10,990
- Yeah, how'd you know?
- Hello, I'm Hortense.

999
01:09:11,958 --> 01:09:13,699
What you talking about?

1000
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:17,157
Hortense Cumberbatch.
I spoke to you on the telephone.

1001
01:09:18,333 --> 01:09:20,407
- What? That was you?
- Yeah.

1002
01:09:21,916 --> 01:09:27,449
Oh, no, no, sweetheart. No, darling.

1003
01:09:27,833 --> 01:09:30,275
You've been ringing the wrong person.

1004
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:32,199
Cynthia Purley.

1005
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:36,574
- Where'd you get my name from, anyway?
- It's on my birth certificate.

1006
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:40,275
What are you talking about
on your birth certificate? It can't be.

1007
01:09:40,375 --> 01:09:42,949
It's got your name
and your address on it.

1008
01:09:46,041 --> 01:09:47,240
There.

1009
01:09:48,666 --> 01:09:53,400
No, that's all wrong, darling.
They've made a mistake down the offices.

1010
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:56,657
You wanna get down there,
get that sorted.

1011
01:09:57,541 --> 01:09:59,066
That's someone havin' a joke.

1012
01:09:59,166 --> 01:10:00,657
I don't think so.

1013
01:10:01,333 --> 01:10:03,240
Let me have a look at that.

1014
01:10:10,375 --> 01:10:13,282
I'm ever so sorry, sweetheart.

1015
01:10:15,125 --> 01:10:19,324
It must be a bit
of a disappointment for you.

1016
01:10:22,708 --> 01:10:25,907
Look, I really think you ought to see
these documents.

1017
01:10:26,666 --> 01:10:28,483
Why, what is it?

1018
01:10:28,583 --> 01:10:33,566
Why don't we... go somewhere and have...
And sit down?

1019
01:10:33,666 --> 01:10:36,525
No, I think I'd better
be going, darling.

1020
01:10:36,625 --> 01:10:39,324
Here, look, you've come
all this way. Please?

1021
01:10:41,166 --> 01:10:44,275
Let's... Let's go and have
a cup of tea or something.

1022
01:10:44,375 --> 01:10:46,324
There's places down there.

1023
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:49,657
Come on.

1024
01:11:01,458 --> 01:11:04,240
I hope you find your mum, sweetheart.

1025
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:07,816
- You keep lookin'. Go on.
- No, thanks. I don't smoke.

1026
01:11:07,916 --> 01:11:10,324
Oh. Nor should ya.

1027
01:11:11,041 --> 01:11:13,365
My daughter smokes like a chimney.

1028
01:11:13,791 --> 01:11:16,449
- You got a daughter?
- Yeah.

1029
01:11:19,791 --> 01:11:21,907
Ain't never been in here before.

1030
01:11:23,875 --> 01:11:27,865
They shouldn't go raising your hopes
like that. It ain't fair.

1031
01:11:29,875 --> 01:11:31,657
Is this your signature?

1032
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:41,865
This is stupid. I don't understand it.

1033
01:11:42,166 --> 01:11:45,691
- I mean, I can't be your mother, can I?
- Why not?

1034
01:11:45,791 --> 01:11:48,449
- Well, look at me.
- What?

1035
01:11:49,125 --> 01:11:51,691
Listen, I don't mean
nothing by it, darling,

1036
01:11:51,791 --> 01:11:56,865
but I ain't never been with a black man
in my life. No disrespect, nor nothing.

1037
01:11:57,666 --> 01:12:00,490
I'd have remembered, wouldn't I?

1038
01:12:12,458 --> 01:12:14,949
Oh, bloody hell.

1039
01:12:19,791 --> 01:12:24,532
Oh, Jesus Christ almighty!

1040
01:12:37,166 --> 01:12:40,032
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

1041
01:12:48,458 --> 01:12:51,407
I'm so ashamed.

1042
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,782
You shouldn't be ashamed.

1043
01:13:01,166 --> 01:13:03,074
I can't look at you.

1044
01:13:06,416 --> 01:13:10,615
I didn't know, sweetheart.
Honest, I didn't know.

1045
01:13:10,791 --> 01:13:11,858
What didn't you know?

1046
01:13:11,958 --> 01:13:14,907
I didn't know you was black.

1047
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:17,949
See, I...

1048
01:13:18,666 --> 01:13:22,240
I thought they'd got
the dates all wrong.

1049
01:13:23,875 --> 01:13:26,566
All this time,
I thought you was born six...

1050
01:13:26,666 --> 01:13:29,449
Six weeks premature, but you weren't.

1051
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:34,407
You wasn't.

1052
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,365
Who was he?

1053
01:13:45,791 --> 01:13:48,150
You don't want to know that, darling.

1054
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:49,490
I do.

1055
01:13:50,458 --> 01:13:56,282
Listen, I want to be honest with you, but I
can't tell you that, sweetheart. I'm sorry.

1056
01:14:04,666 --> 01:14:06,365
I'm sorry.

1057
01:14:11,333 --> 01:14:13,157
Look at ya.

1058
01:14:17,958 --> 01:14:21,941
It's a bit... I'm a bit of a
disappointment to you, ain't I?

1059
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:23,240
No.

1060
01:14:23,916 --> 01:14:26,108
You don't have to say that, darling.

1061
01:14:26,208 --> 01:14:27,574
I know.

1062
01:14:28,166 --> 01:14:31,532
You've been better off without me,
I can tell you that much.

1063
01:14:32,125 --> 01:14:34,490
I done you a good turn.

1064
01:14:37,375 --> 01:14:39,324
Your tea getting's cold.

1065
01:14:51,291 --> 01:14:53,324
What's your mum like, then?

1066
01:14:54,958 --> 01:14:57,407
Does she mind you lookin' for me?

1067
01:14:57,833 --> 01:14:59,108
My mum died recently.

1068
01:14:59,208 --> 01:15:01,157
Oh, I'm sorry.

1069
01:15:03,333 --> 01:15:05,240
What about your dad?

1070
01:15:06,041 --> 01:15:07,907
- He's dead and all.
- Oh.

1071
01:15:17,166 --> 01:15:21,865
- Are you married?
- No, no, I ain't...

1072
01:15:23,166 --> 01:15:25,407
I ain't married, sweetheart.

1073
01:15:31,666 --> 01:15:33,574
- Are you?
- No.

1074
01:15:33,833 --> 01:15:36,316
I'll bet you got a
boyfriend though, ain't ya?

1075
01:15:36,416 --> 01:15:37,733
No, not at the moment.

1076
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:40,699
Oh, a nice lookin' girl like you?

1077
01:15:46,541 --> 01:15:48,150
Have you got a boyfriend?

1078
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:50,490
I give 'em all a wide berth.

1079
01:15:50,708 --> 01:15:53,900
They got me into enough trouble
in the past, ain't they?

1080
01:16:24,375 --> 01:16:26,441
- You got a job, have ya?
- Yeah.

1081
01:16:26,541 --> 01:16:28,157
That's good.

1082
01:16:30,416 --> 01:16:31,441
What doing?

1083
01:16:31,541 --> 01:16:32,691
I'm an optometrist.

1084
01:16:34,458 --> 01:16:37,574
I test eyes. Optician.

1085
01:16:38,333 --> 01:16:39,949
Are you?

1086
01:16:42,208 --> 01:16:43,615
Well...

1087
01:16:45,958 --> 01:16:48,157
There's a turn-up.

1088
01:16:50,208 --> 01:16:51,949
What do you do?

1089
01:16:52,833 --> 01:16:54,657
I work in a factory.

1090
01:16:56,166 --> 01:16:57,574
Do you like it?

1091
01:16:57,708 --> 01:16:59,574
Well, it pays the rent.

1092
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:04,615
How about your daughter?

1093
01:17:06,541 --> 01:17:08,782
She works for the Council.

1094
01:17:09,916 --> 01:17:13,240
- Have you got any sisters?
- No, two brothers.

1095
01:17:13,666 --> 01:17:17,490
Are they, adopted?

1096
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:18,949
No.

1097
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:22,032
What do they do?

1098
01:17:22,416 --> 01:17:26,032
One's a computer salesman
and the other one's got his own garage.

1099
01:17:27,666 --> 01:17:31,574
I bet your mum was
proud of you, wasn't she?

1100
01:17:32,791 --> 01:17:35,608
- Yeah, she was.
- Yeah, 'course she was.

1101
01:17:35,708 --> 01:17:37,490
I'd have been proud.

1102
01:17:49,958 --> 01:17:51,990
Why didn't you want to see me?

1103
01:17:52,875 --> 01:17:56,275
Well, 'cause nobody knows
about you, sweetheart.

1104
01:17:56,375 --> 01:17:59,365
I don't want to upset me daughter, do I?

1105
01:18:00,625 --> 01:18:02,532
I mean, when I was born.

1106
01:18:04,791 --> 01:18:06,407
Well, I couldn't.

1107
01:18:07,958 --> 01:18:11,990
I was too upset, see?
They wanted me to look at ya.

1108
01:18:12,250 --> 01:18:16,265
They wanted me to hold you, but I couldn't...
I just couldn't.

1109
01:18:18,208 --> 01:18:23,240
I didn't know if I was coming or going.
I was only a little girl meself, 16.

1110
01:18:24,625 --> 01:18:26,532
I didn't have no choice.

1111
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:30,983
If I'd have seen you,
I'd have wanted to keep you.

1112
01:18:31,083 --> 01:18:34,199
You do believe me,
don't you, sweetheart?

1113
01:18:41,791 --> 01:18:44,032
I don't blame you, darlin'.

1114
01:18:54,125 --> 01:18:56,566
You've only just found out?

1115
01:18:56,666 --> 01:18:59,490
No, I've known since I was seven.

1116
01:18:59,875 --> 01:19:03,365
- What? Your mum and dad told you, did they?
- Yeah, they did.

1117
01:19:04,666 --> 01:19:07,074
They sound like nice people.

1118
01:19:07,625 --> 01:19:08,824
Yeah.

1119
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,074
My mum told me on the plane
on our way back from Barbados.

1120
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,657
Little girl.

1121
01:19:18,083 --> 01:19:19,782
Was you upset?

1122
01:19:22,208 --> 01:19:24,282
I just looked out at the clouds.

1123
01:19:47,250 --> 01:19:49,365
Haven't you ever thought about me?

1124
01:19:49,833 --> 01:19:52,449
Yeah, 'course I have.

1125
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:57,157
But it ain't no good pining over
what you ain't got, is it?

1126
01:19:58,458 --> 01:20:00,407
But didn't you think I'd look for you?

1127
01:20:01,375 --> 01:20:03,365
No, I didn't, as it happens.

1128
01:20:05,958 --> 01:20:07,949
Wish you hadn't bothered now, don't you?

1129
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:11,407
No, I'm glad.

1130
01:20:13,541 --> 01:20:16,407
I don't want to disrupt your family
or anything.

1131
01:20:17,416 --> 01:20:19,324
I just had to see you.

1132
01:20:22,333 --> 01:20:24,365
I had to know who you were.

1133
01:20:25,416 --> 01:20:32,407
Listen, I want to wish you all the best,
sweetheart, whatever you do.

1134
01:20:32,541 --> 01:20:34,574
And I'll be thinkin' of you.

1135
01:21:13,458 --> 01:21:15,074
Bit quiet, ain't ya?

1136
01:21:15,916 --> 01:21:17,115
What's up?

1137
01:21:18,375 --> 01:21:21,032
- You goin' out?
- Yeah, in a bit.

1138
01:21:21,875 --> 01:21:23,191
You feelin' all right?

1139
01:21:23,291 --> 01:21:27,365
Oh, there's nothing the matter with me,
sweetheart. Nothing at all.

1140
01:21:30,166 --> 01:21:32,740
- Did you find anything today?
- Frozen chicken.

1141
01:21:34,416 --> 01:21:36,699
- What, in the road?
- No, in a bin.

1142
01:21:38,625 --> 01:21:40,490
It was still cold.

1143
01:21:40,875 --> 01:21:42,490
Some dirty magazines.

1144
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,157
- Did you bring them home?
- No.

1145
01:21:49,583 --> 01:21:51,824
Still, I suppose there are worse jobs.

1146
01:21:55,125 --> 01:21:57,532
Gotta laugh, ain't you, sweetheart?

1147
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:01,782
Else you'd cry.

1148
01:22:33,916 --> 01:22:35,115
Hello?

1149
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:37,907
- Is that Hortense?
- Speaking.

1150
01:22:38,333 --> 01:22:39,782
It's Cynthia.

1151
01:22:40,375 --> 01:22:41,574
Hello.

1152
01:22:42,708 --> 01:22:44,657
I didn't think you'd be in.

1153
01:22:44,916 --> 01:22:46,449
I am.

1154
01:22:47,916 --> 01:22:52,032
Well, I just...
wanted to ring up and say...

1155
01:22:52,875 --> 01:22:55,865
How nice it was to meet you yesterday.
That's all.

1156
01:22:56,583 --> 01:22:57,782
Thank you.

1157
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:01,407
Been thinkin' about you all day.

1158
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:03,740
I've been thinking about you.

1159
01:23:04,125 --> 01:23:05,782
Yeah, well...

1160
01:23:07,291 --> 01:23:09,574
I just wanted to say that.

1161
01:23:11,750 --> 01:23:12,949
Thank you.

1162
01:23:13,666 --> 01:23:16,240
I don't know what to say now.
Daft, ain't it?

1163
01:23:21,291 --> 01:23:22,615
Got home all right, did you?

1164
01:23:23,291 --> 01:23:24,990
Yeah, thank you.

1165
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:35,816
What have you been doing today?

1166
01:23:35,916 --> 01:23:38,449
Oh, just out the back sunning meself.

1167
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:41,108
What you been doing?

1168
01:23:41,208 --> 01:23:42,816
Just chillin' out, really.

1169
01:23:42,916 --> 01:23:43,941
Yeah, hot, ain't it?

1170
01:23:44,041 --> 01:23:45,615
Yeah.

1171
01:23:48,083 --> 01:23:52,032
Well, that all I wanted
to say, sweetheart.

1172
01:23:53,291 --> 01:23:54,490
Ta-ta, then.

1173
01:23:54,958 --> 01:23:56,865
I'd really like to see you again.

1174
01:23:58,125 --> 01:24:00,115
- Would ya?
- Yeah.

1175
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:01,615
Oh, that'd be nice.

1176
01:24:02,541 --> 01:24:04,157
Do you like Italian food?

1177
01:24:04,333 --> 01:24:08,733
Yeah. Eat anything, me.
Chinese, kebabs, the lot.

1178
01:24:10,791 --> 01:24:13,157
- What?
- Nothing.

1179
01:24:13,708 --> 01:24:14,907
It's great.

1180
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,790
And...

1181
01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:38,157
Okay, other side, please.

1182
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,151
And...

1183
01:24:43,791 --> 01:24:47,074
Lovely. So if you bring your face
round this way, please.

1184
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:48,532
Can you shut the door, please?

1185
01:24:50,333 --> 01:24:51,865
Yeah, sure.

1186
01:24:57,250 --> 01:24:58,449
Sorry.

1187
01:25:00,916 --> 01:25:02,691
So, who did your original photographs?

1188
01:25:02,791 --> 01:25:03,775
My dad, actually.

1189
01:25:03,875 --> 01:25:06,949
But my solicitor said
that they weren't good enough.

1190
01:25:07,208 --> 01:25:10,482
- Do you have a police photographer?
- No.

1191
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:12,566
I'm just gonna come in a bit closer.

1192
01:25:12,666 --> 01:25:15,108
So I hope you don't suffer
from claustrophobia.

1193
01:25:15,208 --> 01:25:16,865
No, I don't actually.

1194
01:25:17,125 --> 01:25:18,574
That's good.

1195
01:25:23,208 --> 01:25:26,824
- Okay, so I'm just gonna move your...
- Thank you.

1196
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:29,699
Sorry. That's great.

1197
01:25:31,083 --> 01:25:33,740
Okay. And...

1198
01:25:34,291 --> 01:25:35,699
A little bit closer.

1199
01:25:40,916 --> 01:25:44,824
Now, I know this isn't very nice.

1200
01:25:46,125 --> 01:25:47,865
But it's gotta be done, hasn't it?

1201
01:25:49,916 --> 01:25:51,733
I want them to look as bad as possible.

1202
01:25:51,833 --> 01:25:53,199
Of course.

1203
01:25:54,833 --> 01:25:57,074
I lost my job. I was good at my job.

1204
01:25:57,666 --> 01:25:58,990
What did you do?

1205
01:26:00,208 --> 01:26:02,282
I'm a beauty consultant.

1206
01:26:03,541 --> 01:26:06,358
Okay. Now, if you just bring your chin up.
Put it up there.

1207
01:26:06,458 --> 01:26:09,340
Lovely, and... That's it.

1208
01:26:11,458 --> 01:26:14,490
So, what actually happened to you?

1209
01:26:15,791 --> 01:26:18,324
My seat belt was broken,
I went through the windscreen.

1210
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:23,115
It wasn't my car. I wasn't driving.
It wasn't my fault.

1211
01:26:23,958 --> 01:26:25,441
- Yeah, you said.
- It wasn't.

1212
01:26:27,958 --> 01:26:29,157
Are you okay?

1213
01:26:35,333 --> 01:26:36,941
Did the driver sustain any injuries?

1214
01:26:37,041 --> 01:26:38,907
No, unfortunately.

1215
01:26:39,666 --> 01:26:41,816
He's obviously not in your good books.

1216
01:26:41,916 --> 01:26:44,233
I ain't seen him since.
I don't want to see him, either.

1217
01:26:44,333 --> 01:26:46,157
Life isn't fair, is it?

1218
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:49,824
Someone always draws the short straw.

1219
01:26:51,250 --> 01:26:53,365
Okay, that's very good. Yeah.

1220
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:57,074
One more.

1221
01:26:59,375 --> 01:27:00,816
- Here's your receipt.
- Thank you.

1222
01:27:00,916 --> 01:27:03,275
So, if you give us a ring in the morning,
we'll see what we can do.

1223
01:27:03,375 --> 01:27:04,574
Fine.

1224
01:27:04,958 --> 01:27:07,907
Bye, then. Mind how you go.

1225
01:27:10,833 --> 01:27:13,365
Oh, Maurice, that's terrible.

1226
01:27:13,833 --> 01:27:16,949
- How'd she do that then?
- Car crash.

1227
01:27:17,166 --> 01:27:19,740
Oh, she's so lovely.

1228
01:27:19,916 --> 01:27:22,740
- Not any more, she isn't.
- It's tragic.

1229
01:27:23,250 --> 01:27:25,108
She's getting some ear hole
from that dosser now.

1230
01:27:25,208 --> 01:27:28,449
Oh, he's been looking at me.
Gives me the creeps.

1231
01:27:34,291 --> 01:27:35,574
I don't believe it.

1232
01:27:36,875 --> 01:27:39,900
How much money
do you think she'll get, then?

1233
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,365
- What?
- Insurance.

1234
01:27:43,041 --> 01:27:45,699
Oh, if she's lucky, 15, 20 grand.

1235
01:27:46,041 --> 01:27:48,574
I don't know what I'd do
if it happened to me.

1236
01:27:49,291 --> 01:27:51,990
Think I'd kill meself.

1237
01:27:58,666 --> 01:28:00,324
- Hello.
- Hiya.

1238
01:28:00,791 --> 01:28:03,066
- Didn't expect to see you.
- Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

1239
01:28:03,166 --> 01:28:04,566
Hello, Monica.

1240
01:28:04,666 --> 01:28:06,032
Hi, Jane.

1241
01:28:06,958 --> 01:28:09,191
Just been for a facial.
I'm dying for a cup of tea.

1242
01:28:09,291 --> 01:28:11,032
- Look over there.
- What?

1243
01:28:11,416 --> 01:28:13,816
- That bloke.
- What bloke?

1244
01:28:13,916 --> 01:28:15,025
See who it is?

1245
01:28:15,125 --> 01:28:17,490
- What? By the lamppost?
- Yeah.

1246
01:28:17,875 --> 01:28:19,449
It's Stuart Christian, isn't it?

1247
01:28:19,708 --> 01:28:21,949
- No.
- It is.

1248
01:28:23,041 --> 01:28:25,615
- But he's in Sydney.
- Is he?

1249
01:28:27,166 --> 01:28:28,657
He's coming over.

1250
01:28:29,208 --> 01:28:30,566
Doesn't look very well, does he?

1251
01:28:30,666 --> 01:28:33,566
- There's that man!
- It's all right, Jane, we know him.

1252
01:28:33,666 --> 01:28:34,650
Do ya?

1253
01:28:34,750 --> 01:28:36,150
What does he want?

1254
01:28:36,250 --> 01:28:37,733
God knows.

1255
01:28:37,833 --> 01:28:39,358
Well, it's over to you then, buster.

1256
01:28:39,458 --> 01:28:41,199
Thanks very much.

1257
01:28:45,208 --> 01:28:46,865
Hello, Stuart.

1258
01:28:47,583 --> 01:28:49,032
Maurice.

1259
01:28:50,333 --> 01:28:51,907
Long time no see.

1260
01:28:52,208 --> 01:28:55,490
Yeah. How's things?

1261
01:28:55,833 --> 01:28:58,615
- Fine, thanks. Fine.
- Good.

1262
01:28:59,750 --> 01:29:01,324
You're looking well.

1263
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:04,199
- You're still here, then.
- Yep.

1264
01:29:05,583 --> 01:29:06,782
Good.

1265
01:29:08,041 --> 01:29:10,157
I thought we'd lost you to Australia.

1266
01:29:10,958 --> 01:29:12,699
Well...

1267
01:29:16,416 --> 01:29:18,816
- How's the wife and kids? Maureen.
- Monica.

1268
01:29:18,916 --> 01:29:20,066
Haven't got any kids.

1269
01:29:20,166 --> 01:29:21,191
- Haven't you?
- No.

1270
01:29:21,291 --> 01:29:23,157
She's great, thanks.

1271
01:29:23,916 --> 01:29:25,657
Good on you, mate.

1272
01:29:39,625 --> 01:29:40,900
You still in the game?

1273
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,032
Look at all this.

1274
01:29:43,583 --> 01:29:45,157
What are you doing?

1275
01:29:46,416 --> 01:29:48,532
It's lost its style, Maurice.

1276
01:29:49,208 --> 01:29:50,824
Has it?

1277
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,865
Looks like a dentist's waiting room.

1278
01:29:58,291 --> 01:29:59,949
I'd kill for a cup of tea.

1279
01:30:01,708 --> 01:30:06,782
If you're 21, or a millionaire,
it's great.

1280
01:30:07,625 --> 01:30:09,824
Or you've got nine kids...

1281
01:30:10,625 --> 01:30:12,865
You're fine. Brilliant.

1282
01:30:13,416 --> 01:30:15,032
Open arms.

1283
01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:17,574
But for guys like you and me,

1284
01:30:18,291 --> 01:30:21,282
it doesn't matter how good you are.
Forget it.

1285
01:30:23,291 --> 01:30:26,900
But it was an experience
and now I'm back.

1286
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,740
That's too bad.

1287
01:30:28,958 --> 01:30:31,441
You were full of such big plans as well.

1288
01:30:31,541 --> 01:30:33,324
Well, it's a big place.

1289
01:30:33,541 --> 01:30:34,733
That's true.

1290
01:30:34,833 --> 01:30:36,324
Too fuckin' big.

1291
01:30:38,375 --> 01:30:41,324
You're looking as gorgeous
as ever, Monica.

1292
01:30:44,041 --> 01:30:46,157
So, Stuart, are you thinking
about setting up again?

1293
01:30:46,583 --> 01:30:48,199
No, forget it.

1294
01:30:48,958 --> 01:30:50,574
Too much of a pain.

1295
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,157
You know what it's like, Maurice.

1296
01:30:53,375 --> 01:30:55,400
You sweat your balls off for years.

1297
01:30:55,500 --> 01:31:00,240
You try and make people happy
and what do you get back? Nothing.

1298
01:31:00,708 --> 01:31:01,907
Thanks.

1299
01:31:07,666 --> 01:31:10,441
Oh, by the way, Stuart,
this is Jane, my assistant.

1300
01:31:10,541 --> 01:31:13,566
This is Mr Christian, the gentleman
I bought the business from.

1301
01:31:13,666 --> 01:31:15,949
- Hello.
- Hiya, Jane.

1302
01:31:17,875 --> 01:31:20,949
- I hope he's treating you well.
- He's all right.

1303
01:31:21,541 --> 01:31:23,066
You can work for me any time.

1304
01:31:23,166 --> 01:31:25,532
I'm all right where I am, thank you.

1305
01:31:32,291 --> 01:31:34,824
Your wife must've been sorry
to come back.

1306
01:31:35,583 --> 01:31:36,949
Which wife?

1307
01:31:38,416 --> 01:31:39,990
That bitch?

1308
01:31:40,833 --> 01:31:43,324
She never came out there
in the first place.

1309
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,941
So, where are you living
at the moment, Stuart?

1310
01:31:48,041 --> 01:31:49,650
- Down in Grays.
- Essex.

1311
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:51,691
Yeah. My mum's place.

1312
01:31:51,791 --> 01:31:53,108
Must be nice for her.

1313
01:31:53,208 --> 01:31:55,074
Having her boy to fuss over.

1314
01:31:55,291 --> 01:31:56,490
She's dead.

1315
01:31:58,166 --> 01:32:00,199
She died when I was still in Bangkok.

1316
01:32:05,375 --> 01:32:07,532
- Sorry to hear that.
- That's a shame.

1317
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,990
Didn't see much of her, anyway.

1318
01:32:12,833 --> 01:32:14,282
It's my dad I miss.

1319
01:32:17,916 --> 01:32:19,949
You win some, you lose some.

1320
01:32:39,291 --> 01:32:41,816
You must've had some lovely weather
in Australia.

1321
01:32:41,916 --> 01:32:43,115
Too hot.

1322
01:32:45,166 --> 01:32:48,740
It's too hot over there,
it's too cold over here.

1323
01:33:03,041 --> 01:33:04,900
Hasn't changed much in here.

1324
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,532
Just a lick of paint.

1325
01:33:07,041 --> 01:33:09,025
Still got the Bronika, then?

1326
01:33:09,125 --> 01:33:10,449
Yep.

1327
01:33:11,875 --> 01:33:15,490
I should've thought you'd be able
to afford a Hasselblad by now, Maurice.

1328
01:33:15,666 --> 01:33:16,865
I can.

1329
01:33:19,125 --> 01:33:20,400
Oh, well-off, are ya?

1330
01:33:21,620 --> 01:33:23,282
Surviving, mate. Yeah.

1331
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:26,949
Yeah.

1332
01:33:27,791 --> 01:33:30,824
You've done very well
out of my business, haven't ya?

1333
01:33:31,041 --> 01:33:32,358
My business.

1334
01:33:32,458 --> 01:33:35,108
- No, it's my business, Maurice.
- No, Stuart, no.

1335
01:33:35,208 --> 01:33:37,650
Used to be your business.
I bought it from you. It's my business.

1336
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:40,941
- Listen. This was an antique shop.
- That's right.

1337
01:33:41,041 --> 01:33:43,233
- There was nothing here.
- That's right, I know.

1338
01:33:43,333 --> 01:33:46,816
I gave you my goodwill.
I gave you my clientele.

1339
01:33:46,916 --> 01:33:48,733
I gave you my fucking reputation.

1340
01:33:48,833 --> 01:33:50,240
You gave me nothing, Stuart.

1341
01:33:51,083 --> 01:33:52,775
With all due respect,
your client list was shit.

1342
01:33:52,875 --> 01:33:54,365
It wasn't.

1343
01:33:55,416 --> 01:33:59,865
I followed it up. I wrote to them,
I rang 'em. I didn't get one bite.

1344
01:34:00,541 --> 01:34:03,608
Now, if there's any success
in this shop, it's down to me.

1345
01:34:03,708 --> 01:34:04,941
That's bollocks!

1346
01:34:05,041 --> 01:34:07,191
No, it's not bollocks, Stuart.
It's the truth.

1347
01:34:07,291 --> 01:34:08,525
How many weddings do you do?

1348
01:34:08,625 --> 01:34:09,775
Oh, enough.

1349
01:34:09,875 --> 01:34:10,941
How many?

1350
01:34:11,041 --> 01:34:12,233
About 40 a year.

1351
01:34:12,333 --> 01:34:13,816
I used to do 140.

1352
01:34:13,916 --> 01:34:16,108
- What, personally?
- No, not personally. No.

1353
01:34:16,208 --> 01:34:18,108
- Nobody does them personally.
- I do.

1354
01:34:18,208 --> 01:34:20,025
Well, then, you're a bloody fool.

1355
01:34:20,125 --> 01:34:22,150
You get people in. Get 'em out there.

1356
01:34:22,250 --> 01:34:24,858
If the work's there, take it.
You got to grab it while you can.

1357
01:34:24,958 --> 01:34:27,233
It's not in my interest
to get some tosser in.

1358
01:34:27,333 --> 01:34:28,483
I mean, I'll have no control.

1359
01:34:28,583 --> 01:34:31,233
- He could fuck up my reputation.
- I'm not a tosser.

1360
01:34:31,333 --> 01:34:33,566
- I didn't say you were.
- I'm not a fuckin' tosser.

1361
01:34:33,666 --> 01:34:35,066
- I'm not talkin' about you.
- Don't call me a tosser.

1362
01:34:35,166 --> 01:34:37,532
I wasn't talking about you, Stuart.

1363
01:34:38,958 --> 01:34:40,532
I can still do it.

1364
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,532
I've still got an eye.

1365
01:34:44,583 --> 01:34:46,240
They can't teach you that.

1366
01:34:47,791 --> 01:34:49,532
I'm still a photographer.

1367
01:34:50,333 --> 01:34:51,782
'Course you are.

1368
01:34:57,208 --> 01:35:01,615
So if you want someone to help you out,
no worries, mate.

1369
01:35:06,750 --> 01:35:08,407
I'll be all right.

1370
01:35:08,916 --> 01:35:13,032
Right, right. I...
I see what you're saying, Stuart, yeah.

1371
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:15,275
I'll bear it in mind.

1372
01:35:15,375 --> 01:35:18,365
- You could lend me a camera.
- Yeah, sure.

1373
01:35:19,208 --> 01:35:21,199
I've had mine nicked.

1374
01:35:28,208 --> 01:35:29,782
Yeah, great.

1375
01:35:32,125 --> 01:35:33,532
Thanks.

1376
01:35:33,791 --> 01:35:35,115
Sure.

1377
01:35:47,250 --> 01:35:49,740
I thought we were
never gonna get rid of him.

1378
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:53,032
There, but for the grace of God.

1379
01:36:15,875 --> 01:36:17,699
Tea's on the table.

1380
01:36:17,916 --> 01:36:19,324
Right.

1381
01:36:26,208 --> 01:36:28,532
- Ain't you having none?
- No.

1382
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:30,657
Why not?

1383
01:36:33,750 --> 01:36:35,449
I'm going out.

1384
01:36:36,666 --> 01:36:38,657
Where are you going?

1385
01:36:42,708 --> 01:36:44,275
I'm off now, then, sweetheart.

1386
01:36:44,375 --> 01:36:46,025
Ain't you gonna tell me where?

1387
01:36:46,125 --> 01:36:47,691
You never tell me where you're going.

1388
01:36:47,791 --> 01:36:49,233
But you don't never go nowhere.

1389
01:36:49,333 --> 01:36:51,941
Well, I'm going somewhere tonight.
Ta-ta.

1390
01:36:52,041 --> 01:36:53,233
Have fun.

1391
01:36:53,333 --> 01:36:54,990
Don't wait up.

1392
01:37:00,916 --> 01:37:03,025
She's been acting right funny.

1393
01:37:03,125 --> 01:37:06,733
- Where's she gone?
- Oh, fuck knows. She wouldn't tell us.

1394
01:37:06,833 --> 01:37:08,358
He's all right, though, Maurice.

1395
01:37:08,458 --> 01:37:10,483
He's always got plenty
of wine in and that.

1396
01:37:10,583 --> 01:37:13,532
- We'll get well-pissed.
- Yeah, nice one.

1397
01:37:18,208 --> 01:37:21,275
I'm a little bit shy of you,
to tell you the truth, sweetheart.

1398
01:37:21,375 --> 01:37:23,282
Me? Oh, you shouldn't be.

1399
01:37:23,708 --> 01:37:25,990
Look at you, sitting there.

1400
01:37:26,708 --> 01:37:29,324
- You look like a model.
- Oh, do I?

1401
01:37:30,125 --> 01:37:32,358
I bet you was a pretty little girl,
wasn't you?

1402
01:37:32,458 --> 01:37:34,115
Yeah. Lovely.

1403
01:37:36,041 --> 01:37:37,150
Don't do that!

1404
01:37:37,250 --> 01:37:39,907
You'll stay like it.

1405
01:37:40,458 --> 01:37:43,282
Stop it! Don't spoil it.

1406
01:37:44,916 --> 01:37:47,400
I used to drive my mum mad,
pulling faces.

1407
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:49,782
Did you? I bet she was
a laugh, wasn't she?

1408
01:37:50,458 --> 01:37:51,650
No, not really.

1409
01:37:51,750 --> 01:37:53,441
Thought you said she was a midwife.

1410
01:37:53,541 --> 01:37:55,233
Yeah, she was.

1411
01:37:55,333 --> 01:37:58,865
Yeah, I'd like to have been one of them.
I love babies.

1412
01:38:02,791 --> 01:38:05,532
- I'm sorry, darling.
- It's all right.

1413
01:38:06,125 --> 01:38:07,275
Cheers.

1414
01:38:07,375 --> 01:38:08,824
Cheers.

1415
01:38:11,791 --> 01:38:12,983
Is that all right for you?

1416
01:38:13,083 --> 01:38:14,650
Yeah, it's lovely.

1417
01:38:14,750 --> 01:38:16,578
Wet, ain't it?

1418
01:38:17,833 --> 01:38:20,316
Where is this food, then? I'm ravishing.

1419
01:38:22,041 --> 01:38:23,240
What?

1420
01:38:28,125 --> 01:38:31,275
I've got so many things I wanna ask you,
but I can't remember what they are.

1421
01:38:31,375 --> 01:38:33,865
Nice to have somebody to talk to, innit?

1422
01:38:35,208 --> 01:38:37,324
- Give us your hand here.
- Oh...

1423
01:38:39,791 --> 01:38:42,282
Oh, you've got beautiful skin.

1424
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,574
Right, let's have a look at you.

1425
01:38:46,916 --> 01:38:48,157
What, can you read palms?

1426
01:38:48,541 --> 01:38:50,074
I used to.

1427
01:38:51,125 --> 01:38:54,566
Ain't done it for years.
Nobody's interested no more.

1428
01:38:54,666 --> 01:38:56,400
Now, if I didn't know you,

1429
01:38:56,500 --> 01:39:00,407
I could see just by lookin' here
what a nice girl you are.

1430
01:39:00,541 --> 01:39:05,360
Big heart. Ooh, you're gonna live
to a ripe old age an' all.

1431
01:39:06,166 --> 01:39:07,816
Let's have a look.

1432
01:39:07,916 --> 01:39:10,657
- Couple of kids. Do you want babies?
- Wow.

1433
01:39:10,875 --> 01:39:12,115
I'm not sure, really.

1434
01:39:12,375 --> 01:39:13,483
Oh, don't ya?

1435
01:39:13,583 --> 01:39:17,032
- Maybe, I don't know yet.
- Yeah, 'course you do.

1436
01:39:18,375 --> 01:39:21,650
- And what star sign are you?
- Leo. I'm on the cusp of Cancer.

1437
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:23,941
And when's your birthday? Oh.

1438
01:39:24,041 --> 01:39:28,199
23rd of July, ain't it?
You'd think I'd know that, wouldn't ya?

1439
01:39:30,208 --> 01:39:31,816
That was the other day, wasn't it?

1440
01:39:31,916 --> 01:39:33,233
Yeah, Sunday.

1441
01:39:33,333 --> 01:39:36,740
Well, why didn't you say nothing
when I phoned ya?

1442
01:39:37,333 --> 01:39:38,316
It's not a big deal.

1443
01:39:38,416 --> 01:39:40,566
- D'you have a party?
- No.

1444
01:39:40,666 --> 01:39:42,025
What d'you do, then?

1445
01:39:42,125 --> 01:39:45,532
Stayed in, read me book,
had a little drink.

1446
01:39:45,833 --> 01:39:47,490
- What, on your own?
- Yeah.

1447
01:39:50,083 --> 01:39:53,240
Well, happy birthday
for Sunday, sweetheart.

1448
01:39:53,833 --> 01:39:55,782
Thank you.

1449
01:39:57,041 --> 01:39:58,407
You're out now, ain't you?

1450
01:39:59,791 --> 01:40:01,691
Yeah. In good company.

1451
01:40:01,791 --> 01:40:03,532
With your mum.

1452
01:40:26,541 --> 01:40:29,150
Have you thought about
having some driving lessons?

1453
01:40:29,250 --> 01:40:31,441
- What for?
- I could get you some for your birthday.

1454
01:40:31,541 --> 01:40:32,983
Don't be stupid.

1455
01:40:33,083 --> 01:40:35,949
Get yourself a little motor?

1456
01:40:36,208 --> 01:40:38,066
Ain't you going out tonight?

1457
01:40:38,166 --> 01:40:40,449
- No.
- Why? What's happened?

1458
01:40:40,791 --> 01:40:42,358
- You going out?
- Yeah, later.

1459
01:40:42,458 --> 01:40:43,608
- Where are you going?
- Down the pub.

1460
01:40:43,708 --> 01:40:46,441
- I hope you're taking care of yourself.
- What d'you mean?

1461
01:40:46,541 --> 01:40:48,941
Well, you don't wanna go
getting knocked up, do ya?

1462
01:40:49,041 --> 01:40:51,108
Don't be so bloody cheeky.

1463
01:40:51,208 --> 01:40:52,990
Not at your age.

1464
01:41:14,125 --> 01:41:16,782
- All right?
- Missed a bit, darlin'.

1465
01:41:55,416 --> 01:41:56,691
Who's this?

1466
01:41:56,791 --> 01:41:59,324
Oh, don't start all that again.

1467
01:42:00,083 --> 01:42:01,775
Come on, who is it?

1468
01:42:01,875 --> 01:42:04,657
- It ain't me, is it? Well, who?
- No.

1469
01:42:04,833 --> 01:42:06,740
Sylvester Stallone.

1470
01:42:07,375 --> 01:42:10,074
I can't understand a word he says.

1471
01:42:10,541 --> 01:42:14,449
- You like looking at him, though.
- No, he ain't my sort.

1472
01:42:15,208 --> 01:42:17,482
- What is your type?
- What, film star?

1473
01:42:17,582 --> 01:42:19,700
- Yeah.
- Marlon.

1474
01:42:20,625 --> 01:42:23,532
Like a bloke with a bit of meat on him.

1475
01:42:24,458 --> 01:42:27,824
What sort of bloke
do you go in for, then?

1476
01:42:29,750 --> 01:42:32,150
Intelligent, sensitive.

1477
01:42:32,250 --> 01:42:33,858
Well, don't you care
what they look like?

1478
01:42:33,958 --> 01:42:36,907
Yeah, but they've gotta have
something going on upstairs.

1479
01:42:37,958 --> 01:42:40,483
You only have black boyfriends, do you?

1480
01:42:40,583 --> 01:42:41,824
No.

1481
01:42:45,875 --> 01:42:50,740
How d'you look after yourself, then,
y'know, if you don't wanna have babies?

1482
01:42:53,041 --> 01:42:54,316
Condoms.

1483
01:42:54,416 --> 01:42:56,650
Oh, you just stop at that then, do you?

1484
01:42:56,750 --> 01:42:59,608
- Yeah, it's the best way, really.
- Ooh, you can't be too careful...

1485
01:42:59,708 --> 01:43:03,282
- ...can you, these days?
- You gotta protect yourself.

1486
01:43:04,541 --> 01:43:06,441
It's my daughter's birthday next week.

1487
01:43:06,541 --> 01:43:08,316
- How old is she?
- 21.

1488
01:43:08,416 --> 01:43:09,441
Nice age.

1489
01:43:09,541 --> 01:43:12,525
Well, she's your sister now,
really, ain't she?

1490
01:43:12,625 --> 01:43:14,740
Yeah, I suppose she is.

1491
01:43:17,416 --> 01:43:20,282
- Does she look like you?
- Yeah, a bit.

1492
01:43:20,791 --> 01:43:23,532
You look more like me than she does.

1493
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:26,449
We're the same build.

1494
01:43:27,375 --> 01:43:29,400
What are her eyes like?

1495
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:30,824
Blue.

1496
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,699
My brother's doing a party for her.

1497
01:43:37,250 --> 01:43:39,483
That's nice.
At least it takes the strain off of you.

1498
01:43:39,583 --> 01:43:41,865
Yeah, well, there is that.

1499
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:45,316
Shame you ain't comin', really.

1500
01:43:45,416 --> 01:43:47,646
Meet your new family.

1501
01:43:48,375 --> 01:43:50,157
Oh, sweetheart!

1502
01:43:50,791 --> 01:43:52,574
I nearly forgot!

1503
01:43:54,458 --> 01:43:56,949
- Happy birthday for Sunday.
- Oh.

1504
01:43:57,666 --> 01:44:01,865
- Oh, you shouldn't have bothered. Oh.
- Oh, it ain't nothing much.

1505
01:44:06,458 --> 01:44:09,115
Aw. Oh, thank you.

1506
01:44:11,166 --> 01:44:13,115
Don't start crying.

1507
01:44:13,541 --> 01:44:15,566
- Perhaps I should ask him.
- What?

1508
01:44:15,666 --> 01:44:17,400
If I can take someone.

1509
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:19,691
Oh, I don't know.
It's a family thing, isn't it?

1510
01:44:19,791 --> 01:44:23,157
Well, you're family, ain't ya?
I'm proud of ya.

1511
01:44:25,666 --> 01:44:30,365
Listen, Maurice, sweetheart,
I wanted to ask you a favour.

1512
01:44:30,708 --> 01:44:32,483
Oh, yeah. What's that, then?

1513
01:44:32,583 --> 01:44:35,275
- You know the party Sunday?
- Barbecue, yeah.

1514
01:44:35,375 --> 01:44:36,574
Yeah.

1515
01:44:37,125 --> 01:44:40,199
Can I bring a mate, sweetheart?

1516
01:44:42,750 --> 01:44:43,949
Hello?

1517
01:44:44,375 --> 01:44:45,358
Is it a bloke?

1518
01:44:45,458 --> 01:44:47,483
Of course it ain't a bloke,
you silly bugger.

1519
01:44:47,583 --> 01:44:51,032
- Chance'd be a fine thing.
- Who is it, then?

1520
01:44:51,250 --> 01:44:55,199
Oh, just someone at work.
We've been out a couple of times.

1521
01:44:55,541 --> 01:44:58,282
And I was meant to have seen her Sunday,
only I forgot.

1522
01:44:59,125 --> 01:45:01,400
- Is that all right, then?
- I suppose so.

1523
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:03,525
What d'you mean, you suppose so?

1524
01:45:03,625 --> 01:45:06,074
- No, it'd be fine.
- Smashing.

1525
01:45:06,625 --> 01:45:07,865
I'll have to check it out, though.

1526
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,240
Check it out? Who with?

1527
01:45:10,458 --> 01:45:13,025
Listen... if I don't phone you back,
bring her, all right?

1528
01:45:13,125 --> 01:45:14,983
I don't wanna upset nobody.

1529
01:45:15,083 --> 01:45:17,900
- Oh, don't worry.
- Are you sure, then?

1530
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,233
Yeah, yeah, no problem, yeah.

1531
01:45:20,333 --> 01:45:23,483
Okay, then, sweetheart.
Lookin' forward to it.

1532
01:45:23,583 --> 01:45:25,608
All right, yeah.
Well, say hello to Roxanne for me.

1533
01:45:25,708 --> 01:45:26,983
Yeah.

1534
01:45:27,083 --> 01:45:30,157
- Ta-ta, then.
- All right, ta-ta. Bye, Cynth.

1535
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:35,316
Listen, I spoke to my little brother today,
and he says it's all right.

1536
01:45:35,416 --> 01:45:37,699
So, do you wanna come, then?

1537
01:45:38,666 --> 01:45:40,108
Oh, I don't know.

1538
01:45:40,208 --> 01:45:42,490
I told him you was me mate.

1539
01:45:42,625 --> 01:45:44,608
I'd still feel a bit awkward.

1540
01:45:44,708 --> 01:45:48,615
Oh, don't be daft, sweetheart.
You'll be with me, won't ya?

1541
01:45:49,250 --> 01:45:50,441
It wouldn't feel right.

1542
01:45:50,541 --> 01:45:52,740
I thought you wanted to come.

1543
01:45:53,333 --> 01:45:54,657
Yeah.

1544
01:45:55,125 --> 01:45:58,324
Oh, well,
'course if you've changed your mind.

1545
01:45:59,083 --> 01:46:00,865
I was lookin' forward to it.

1546
01:46:01,166 --> 01:46:02,615
Oh, I know.

1547
01:46:03,333 --> 01:46:04,740
What d'you think, then?

1548
01:46:05,250 --> 01:46:06,490
All right. I'll come.

1549
01:46:06,625 --> 01:46:08,108
- You're coming?
- Yeah.

1550
01:46:08,208 --> 01:46:10,691
All right, then, sweetheart, listen.

1551
01:46:10,791 --> 01:46:14,316
I'll give you a ring later in the week,
and give you the address and everything.

1552
01:46:14,416 --> 01:46:17,150
- Okay, then.
- Okay, ta-ta, then.

1553
01:46:17,250 --> 01:46:18,449
Bye-bye.

1554
01:46:27,958 --> 01:46:30,365
You should've just said yes.

1555
01:46:30,541 --> 01:46:32,907
Makin' me look like a... Oh.

1556
01:46:33,791 --> 01:46:37,066
- I can hardly say no now. Oh.
- That's up to you.

1557
01:46:37,166 --> 01:46:39,525
We don't know anything about this person,
whoever she is.

1558
01:46:39,625 --> 01:46:41,733
It's some new mate.
They've been out a few times.

1559
01:46:41,833 --> 01:46:44,066
Oh, two hysterical nutters.

1560
01:46:44,166 --> 01:46:46,175
I'm just glad she's got a friend.

1561
01:46:46,451 --> 01:46:50,441
- I'm gonna have a great time.
- I thought I'd ask Jane as well.

1562
01:46:50,541 --> 01:46:54,775
Anybody else you want to invite?
We've only got four garden chairs.

1563
01:46:57,041 --> 01:46:59,740
Oh, give us two of them painkillers.

1564
01:47:02,875 --> 01:47:04,532
There you go.

1565
01:47:05,125 --> 01:47:07,782
Do you fancy some fish and chips?

1566
01:47:08,250 --> 01:47:10,108
Don't be sarcastic.

1567
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:11,990
I wasn't. Sorry.

1568
01:47:42,875 --> 01:47:44,532
Cheers, mate.

1569
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:53,983
- There's a bell 'ere.
- Don't do that!

1570
01:47:54,083 --> 01:47:56,532
- I've just done the knocker!
- All right!

1571
01:47:57,541 --> 01:47:58,900
Hello, there.

1572
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,025
Hello, sweetheart.

1573
01:48:01,125 --> 01:48:02,566
You got here in one piece, then?

1574
01:48:02,666 --> 01:48:04,775
Long time no see.

1575
01:48:04,875 --> 01:48:06,608
Yes, that's right. Thank you.

1576
01:48:06,708 --> 01:48:08,733
- Hello, birthday girl!
- All right, Monica?

1577
01:48:08,833 --> 01:48:11,490
- Oh, look at you!
- This is Paul.

1578
01:48:11,666 --> 01:48:12,941
- Hello, Paul.
- How d'you do?

1579
01:48:13,041 --> 01:48:14,691
Nice to meet you.

1580
01:48:14,791 --> 01:48:16,032
Oh, here's Maurice.

1581
01:48:17,666 --> 01:48:19,574
Now, come away in.

1582
01:48:21,458 --> 01:48:23,490
- Hi, Jane.
- Hello, Monica.

1583
01:48:26,791 --> 01:48:30,199
Oh, this is Jane. Maurice has just been
picking her up from the station.

1584
01:48:31,166 --> 01:48:34,025
Here he is. Hello, sweetheart.

1585
01:48:34,125 --> 01:48:36,782
- Hiya.
- All right, Maurice?

1586
01:48:37,916 --> 01:48:39,775
- I got you that.
- You didn't have to do that.

1587
01:48:39,875 --> 01:48:42,350
- It's all right. Yeah.
- All right?

1588
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:44,858
This is Paul, Maurice.

1589
01:48:44,958 --> 01:48:46,775
- All right, mate.
- Ain't you got one for me, then?

1590
01:48:46,875 --> 01:48:49,740
- Yeah, 'course I have.
- Hello, darlin'.

1591
01:48:49,916 --> 01:48:50,941
Don't kill him.

1592
01:48:51,041 --> 01:48:54,824
Cor, you've landed on your feet here,
ain't you, Maurice?

1593
01:48:55,166 --> 01:48:56,608
This is Jane, my lovely assistant.

1594
01:48:56,708 --> 01:48:58,566
Yeah, talked to you on the phone,
ain't I, Jane?

1595
01:48:58,666 --> 01:49:01,108
- Yeah, that's right.
- Oh, can I take your coats?

1596
01:49:01,208 --> 01:49:02,400
- Yes.
- Right, what d'you want to drink?

1597
01:49:02,500 --> 01:49:04,941
- Red, white, rosé, beer?
- Oh, I'll have white, Maurice.

1598
01:49:05,041 --> 01:49:07,983
- Yeah, beer. You're welcome.
- Oh, thanks a lot, cheers. Cynth?

1599
01:49:08,083 --> 01:49:09,941
- I'll have white, please, Maurice.
- Jane?

1600
01:49:10,041 --> 01:49:11,865
- Rosé.
- Okey-doke.

1601
01:49:13,875 --> 01:49:16,066
- Where's the friend, then?
- I've no idea.

1602
01:49:16,166 --> 01:49:17,566
Have you got an ashtray, darlin'?

1603
01:49:17,666 --> 01:49:22,483
Oh, there's one on the coffee table, Cynthia.
I didn't think you would've given up.

1604
01:49:22,583 --> 01:49:25,191
Oh, one of the few
pleasures in life, Monica.

1605
01:49:25,291 --> 01:49:28,400
- These are very bright.
- Don't you like 'em?

1606
01:49:28,500 --> 01:49:31,199
Yeah. I'll just put them in a vase.

1607
01:49:34,208 --> 01:49:37,115
- What you got that up there for?
- We like it.

1608
01:49:37,625 --> 01:49:40,358
Well, don't laugh. It's stupid.

1609
01:49:40,458 --> 01:49:42,358
It's one of my early works.

1610
01:49:42,458 --> 01:49:43,608
You miserable little git.

1611
01:49:43,708 --> 01:49:45,358
He was fucking around behind the camera.

1612
01:49:45,458 --> 01:49:47,733
Oi, mind your language, little sod.

1613
01:49:49,708 --> 01:49:52,066
- So how's work, then?
- Oh, it's all right, yeah.

1614
01:49:52,166 --> 01:49:53,775
- Are you still enjoying it?
- Yeah, it's all right.

1615
01:49:53,875 --> 01:49:54,941
When are you going to college again?

1616
01:49:55,041 --> 01:49:56,108
Shut up about college.

1617
01:49:56,208 --> 01:49:57,941
- You're going to college, ain't you?
- No, I ain't.

1618
01:49:58,041 --> 01:49:59,400
Well, you should do.
You got a good brain.

1619
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:00,733
I don't want to use it, though.

1620
01:50:00,833 --> 01:50:03,532
- Well, suit yourself.
- Yeah, I will.

1621
01:50:04,083 --> 01:50:05,275
Paul's a scaffolder.

1622
01:50:05,375 --> 01:50:08,115
Yeah, your mum said.
Bet that's hard work, innit?

1623
01:50:08,791 --> 01:50:10,941
- Can be, mate, yeah.
- Especially in the winter.

1624
01:50:11,041 --> 01:50:12,449
That's right.

1625
01:50:14,583 --> 01:50:16,816
I wanted to give it
a Mediterranean feel.

1626
01:50:16,916 --> 01:50:18,275
Oh, it's a lovely kitchen.

1627
01:50:18,375 --> 01:50:19,691
And this is the... Oops.

1628
01:50:19,791 --> 01:50:21,191
Oh, that's a big lavatory.

1629
01:50:21,291 --> 01:50:22,900
This is the downstairs toilet.

1630
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,066
Oh, that's handy, isn't it?
'Cause if you're in the garden...

1631
01:50:25,166 --> 01:50:27,566
Exactly. It's really convenient.

1632
01:50:27,666 --> 01:50:30,233
And I think the peach tones
make it quite tranquil.

1633
01:50:30,333 --> 01:50:31,691
Yeah.

1634
01:50:31,791 --> 01:50:34,191
So, you know where it is,
if you need it.

1635
01:50:34,291 --> 01:50:36,150
Now... Excuse me, Jane.

1636
01:50:36,250 --> 01:50:39,150
- This is the garage.
- I thought it was a cupboard.

1637
01:50:39,250 --> 01:50:42,150
- Is that a new car?
- Yes. That's my car.

1638
01:50:42,250 --> 01:50:44,275
What was the matter with your other one?

1639
01:50:44,375 --> 01:50:47,115
Nothing. I'll show you upstairs.

1640
01:50:53,458 --> 01:50:55,490
We'll start with this.

1641
01:50:56,291 --> 01:50:58,150
Oh, there's the tank.

1642
01:50:58,250 --> 01:51:01,150
- That's where I keep my towels, and bed linen.
- Just your airing cupboard.

1643
01:51:01,250 --> 01:51:03,358
It's not very capacious.

1644
01:51:03,458 --> 01:51:05,858
And this is Maurice's bathroom.

1645
01:51:05,958 --> 01:51:07,983
It's green. Matches your tank.

1646
01:51:08,083 --> 01:51:10,525
Are these all new carpets,
are they, sweetheart?

1647
01:51:10,625 --> 01:51:12,074
Oh, yes.

1648
01:51:13,375 --> 01:51:15,233
And this is the master bedroom.

1649
01:51:15,333 --> 01:51:19,691
- Cor, it's more like the bridal suite.
- It's beautiful.

1650
01:51:19,791 --> 01:51:21,733
I have always wanted a four-poster.

1651
01:51:21,833 --> 01:51:24,775
I can see Maurice
thrashing about in there.

1652
01:51:24,875 --> 01:51:26,025
It is a king-size.

1653
01:51:26,125 --> 01:51:28,025
Ooh, it's like something
out of a fairy tale.

1654
01:51:28,125 --> 01:51:29,816
Bet this cost a bob or two.

1655
01:51:29,916 --> 01:51:31,358
Well, it certainly wasn't cheap.

1656
01:51:31,458 --> 01:51:33,650
And here's another lavatory!

1657
01:51:33,750 --> 01:51:35,816
Oh, that bathroom's mine, the en suite.

1658
01:51:35,916 --> 01:51:39,066
You got the one each, have you?
That's nice, ain't it, Jane?

1659
01:51:39,166 --> 01:51:40,233
It's like a hotel.

1660
01:51:40,333 --> 01:51:42,441
You don't want to be
tripping over each other.

1661
01:51:42,541 --> 01:51:45,199
Oh, you've got everything, Monica.

1662
01:51:46,541 --> 01:51:49,108
- So, where's this friend, then?
- He's here, ain't he?

1663
01:51:49,208 --> 01:51:51,108
No. Your mum's.

1664
01:51:51,208 --> 01:51:52,441
What you talking about?

1665
01:51:52,541 --> 01:51:55,400
She rang me at the shop, and asked me
if she could bring a friend from work.

1666
01:51:55,500 --> 01:51:57,066
It's the first I've heard of it.

1667
01:51:57,166 --> 01:51:58,358
- Is it?
- Yeah.

1668
01:51:58,458 --> 01:52:00,108
- What, she's never mentioned it?
- No.

1669
01:52:00,208 --> 01:52:01,449
Peculiar.

1670
01:52:01,625 --> 01:52:04,650
That must be who she's
been going out with.

1671
01:52:04,750 --> 01:52:07,199
She's a dark horse, isn't she?

1672
01:52:11,375 --> 01:52:12,733
- Hello?
- No, I'm sorry.

1673
01:52:12,833 --> 01:52:15,525
I'm a friend of Cynthia's.

1674
01:52:15,625 --> 01:52:17,525
Yes. Oh, yes, of course.

1675
01:52:17,625 --> 01:52:19,650
- Hello, sweetheart!
- Hello.

1676
01:52:19,750 --> 01:52:22,941
- I thought you were...
- Come on in!

1677
01:52:23,041 --> 01:52:25,400
- That's me mate, Hortense.
- Hi.

1678
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:28,025
- That's me brother's wife.
- Oh, pleased to meet you.

1679
01:52:28,125 --> 01:52:29,191
- Monica.
- Hello, Monica.

1680
01:52:29,291 --> 01:52:32,108
Yeah, well, come on out the back,
meet me brother.

1681
01:52:32,208 --> 01:52:33,532
Okay.

1682
01:52:34,458 --> 01:52:35,900
Can I take your coat for you...

1683
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,108
- Hortense.
- Hortense.

1684
01:52:37,208 --> 01:52:38,782
Thank you.

1685
01:52:41,291 --> 01:52:43,191
This is me little brother, Maurice.

1686
01:52:43,291 --> 01:52:45,358
- Hello, pleased to meet you, Maurice.
- How do you do?

1687
01:52:45,458 --> 01:52:48,358
Ain't that little, is he?
That's Hortense.

1688
01:52:48,458 --> 01:52:49,775
- Hortense?
- Yeah, that's right.

1689
01:52:49,875 --> 01:52:52,782
And this is me daughter, Roxanne.

1690
01:52:52,958 --> 01:52:54,650
Oh, happy birthday.

1691
01:52:54,750 --> 01:52:59,233
- Oh, you didn't have to do that, sweetheart!
- There you go. It's okay.

1692
01:52:59,333 --> 01:53:00,983
That's Paul, her intended.

1693
01:53:01,083 --> 01:53:02,150
He ain't me intended.

1694
01:53:02,250 --> 01:53:03,650
- And this is...
- Pleased to meet you, Paul.

1695
01:53:03,750 --> 01:53:05,608
- Jane.
- Maurice's assistant.

1696
01:53:05,708 --> 01:53:07,108
- Hi. Oh, you, too.
- Very nice to meet you.

1697
01:53:07,208 --> 01:53:09,483
- Oh, that's nice, ain't it, sweet?
- That's expensive.

1698
01:53:09,583 --> 01:53:10,650
What would you like to drink,
red, white, rosé?

1699
01:53:10,750 --> 01:53:11,900
- White wine, please.
- You want to put that away.

1700
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,733
- Have that tomorrow.
- Thanks, that's really nice.

1701
01:53:13,833 --> 01:53:15,858
- You're welcome.
- We'll have it later.

1702
01:53:15,958 --> 01:53:17,400
No, don't waste it!

1703
01:53:17,500 --> 01:53:20,483
I've got some for later
to have with the cake.

1704
01:53:20,583 --> 01:53:21,775
We thought you'd got lost.

1705
01:53:21,875 --> 01:53:23,400
Well, I took a couple of wrong turns.

1706
01:53:23,500 --> 01:53:24,525
D'you come in a minicab, did you?

1707
01:53:24,625 --> 01:53:25,650
- No, she's got a car.
- No, I drove.

1708
01:53:25,750 --> 01:53:26,775
That's really nice, that. Thanks.

1709
01:53:26,875 --> 01:53:27,900
- It's okay.
- There you go.

1710
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,025
- Thank you.
- Who wants a top-up?

1711
01:53:29,125 --> 01:53:30,233
I'll have one with you, Maurice.

1712
01:53:30,333 --> 01:53:32,358
- Not for me, thanks.
- You all right?

1713
01:53:32,458 --> 01:53:33,775
- Would you like a crisp?
- Yeah, so far.

1714
01:53:33,875 --> 01:53:34,900
- Good.
- Hortense?

1715
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:36,191
- No, I'm fine, thanks.
- No? No?

1716
01:53:36,291 --> 01:53:39,316
I only met Paul
for the first time today, Hortense.

1717
01:53:39,416 --> 01:53:41,191
- Really?
- He's a scaffolder.

1718
01:53:41,291 --> 01:53:42,816
- Are ya?
- Yeah.

1719
01:53:42,916 --> 01:53:44,691
- Another one bites the dust.
- Way!

1720
01:53:44,791 --> 01:53:47,608
- That must be quite dangerous, Paul.
- Yeah, well, it can be.

1721
01:53:47,708 --> 01:53:49,525
Here, come, and lollop over here.

1722
01:53:49,625 --> 01:53:53,199
- Do you have to go up really high?
- Sometimes, yeah.

1723
01:53:54,666 --> 01:53:56,441
Just you and the elements, really.

1724
01:53:56,541 --> 01:53:58,483
Ever fallen off?

1725
01:53:58,583 --> 01:54:00,233
- Would you like a crudité?
- Thank you, no.

1726
01:54:00,333 --> 01:54:02,157
- I think I'll wait till later.
- Oh, well.

1727
01:54:02,583 --> 01:54:04,608
- So you work with my mum, yeah?
- Yeah.

1728
01:54:04,708 --> 01:54:06,483
- Not on the machines?
- No.

1729
01:54:06,583 --> 01:54:07,983
Are you coming round
tomorrow night, Paul?

1730
01:54:08,083 --> 01:54:09,108
- Mum.
- Well, it's...

1731
01:54:09,208 --> 01:54:10,525
We're going out.

1732
01:54:10,625 --> 01:54:13,983
Well, you'll come round beforehand,
won't you? Have a drink? It's her 21 st.

1733
01:54:14,083 --> 01:54:15,233
It's no big deal.

1734
01:54:15,333 --> 01:54:17,316
Well, I ain't give you your present yet.

1735
01:54:17,416 --> 01:54:19,324
Chicken drumsticks.

1736
01:54:20,416 --> 01:54:22,150
- D'you want some salad, sweetheart?
- Yes, please.

1737
01:54:22,250 --> 01:54:23,275
I'll get you some.

1738
01:54:23,375 --> 01:54:24,525
- Are you doing something special...
- Thanks.

1739
01:54:24,625 --> 01:54:27,150
- ...tomorrow night, you two? Oh.
- No, down the pub as usual.

1740
01:54:27,250 --> 01:54:28,983
Oh, use fingers.

1741
01:54:29,083 --> 01:54:31,483
Use what you like.
Use your feet if you want.

1742
01:54:31,583 --> 01:54:34,191
- You've got a knife and fork there, Jane.
- It's a bit late now.

1743
01:54:34,291 --> 01:54:35,608
What d'you do at the factory, then?

1744
01:54:35,708 --> 01:54:37,483
This looks really lovely,
Maurice, thank you.

1745
01:54:37,583 --> 01:54:38,733
I hope it doesn't kill you.

1746
01:54:38,833 --> 01:54:40,400
There's salad servers there, Cynthia.

1747
01:54:40,500 --> 01:54:42,025
- You ain't her boss, are you?
- No.

1748
01:54:42,125 --> 01:54:43,941
- Here you are, sweetheart.
- Thank you.

1749
01:54:44,041 --> 01:54:45,983
- Do you want some salad, Paul?
- No, I'm all right, thanks.

1750
01:54:46,083 --> 01:54:47,525
It's good for you, make you go.

1751
01:54:47,625 --> 01:54:49,525
He don't want none.

1752
01:54:49,625 --> 01:54:51,941
What about Jane, does she want salad?

1753
01:54:52,041 --> 01:54:53,990
Yeah, ta very much.

1754
01:54:55,166 --> 01:54:56,566
What do you do, then, Roxanne?

1755
01:54:56,666 --> 01:54:58,775
- I work for the Council.
- What, down the dole?

1756
01:54:58,875 --> 01:55:00,400
- No. I'm a road sweeper.
- Wow.

1757
01:55:00,500 --> 01:55:01,483
- Are ya?
- Yeah.

1758
01:55:01,583 --> 01:55:03,941
- Who's for a potato?
- She's got my plate.

1759
01:55:04,041 --> 01:55:05,608
- Here y'are, sweetheart.
- One for you, Hortense?

1760
01:55:05,708 --> 01:55:07,025
- Yes, please.
- Yeah, I'll have some of that an' all.

1761
01:55:07,125 --> 01:55:08,775
- Thank you.
- Please.

1762
01:55:08,875 --> 01:55:11,650
Yeah, you do get girl road sweepers,
don't ya?

1763
01:55:11,750 --> 01:55:13,816
- Right. Burgers and bangers.
- Nice one.

1764
01:55:13,916 --> 01:55:15,650
Here, that's your one, Roxanne.

1765
01:55:15,750 --> 01:55:17,650
That's the one with your name on it,
the burnt one, all right?

1766
01:55:17,750 --> 01:55:18,775
Yeah.

1767
01:55:18,875 --> 01:55:20,525
- Potato for you, Paul?
- Please.

1768
01:55:20,625 --> 01:55:22,941
- There's a nice, big one.
- Here you are, darling.

1769
01:55:23,041 --> 01:55:24,483
- One for you, pet.
- Ta.

1770
01:55:24,583 --> 01:55:27,608
- Shall I do you, Monica?
- I can see to myself, thanks, Cynthia.

1771
01:55:27,708 --> 01:55:28,941
Why don't you sit down?

1772
01:55:29,041 --> 01:55:31,858
What about Maurice?
Who's lookin' after the worker?

1773
01:55:31,958 --> 01:55:33,608
Don't worry about me. I've been pickin'.

1774
01:55:33,708 --> 01:55:34,691
- I'll eat in a minute.
- Oops, sorry.

1775
01:55:34,791 --> 01:55:36,733
Your potato's on
your plate there, Cynthia.

1776
01:55:36,833 --> 01:55:38,316
Think I'll have some salad.

1777
01:55:38,416 --> 01:55:40,150
- Can I have my tongs back, please?
- Oh, sorry.

1778
01:55:40,250 --> 01:55:41,941
- Got butter?
- Yes, just a minute.

1779
01:55:42,041 --> 01:55:43,816
I'll have some mustard
while you're there, Monica.

1780
01:55:43,916 --> 01:55:47,108
Oh, you like the American,
don't you, Roxanne?

1781
01:55:47,208 --> 01:55:48,358
Yeah, ta.

1782
01:55:48,458 --> 01:55:50,990
All right. Just get some salad.

1783
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:54,566
- Do you want some butter, Paul?
- You all right, darlin'?

1784
01:55:54,666 --> 01:55:56,066
- Yeah. Just waiting for the butter.
- Please.

1785
01:55:56,166 --> 01:55:57,275
There you go, Cynth.

1786
01:55:57,375 --> 01:56:00,066
- Oh, Maurice!
- That'll shut you up.

1787
01:56:00,166 --> 01:56:03,066
- Oh, you having a steak, are you, Cynthia?
- Thanks.

1788
01:56:03,166 --> 01:56:04,441
Yes, thank you, Monica.

1789
01:56:04,541 --> 01:56:07,574
Oh, well, that'll put hairs
on your chest.

1790
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,358
Like some mustard,
or would you prefer the French?

1791
01:56:10,458 --> 01:56:12,316
This looks lovely, Maurice.

1792
01:56:12,416 --> 01:56:14,066
- Right. There you go, mate.
- Do you want some of that?

1793
01:56:14,166 --> 01:56:15,775
- Oh, thanks, darling.
- Half a cow for you.

1794
01:56:15,875 --> 01:56:19,775
- Fuckin' hell! Look at the size of that!
- Oh, that's ridiculous.

1795
01:56:19,875 --> 01:56:21,441
- There's enough there for all of us.
- Cheers.

1796
01:56:21,541 --> 01:56:23,483
That'll put some colour
in your cheeks, Paul.

1797
01:56:23,583 --> 01:56:25,816
Right. You're sure no one else
wants a steak?

1798
01:56:25,916 --> 01:56:28,066
- Well, ain't you having one?
- No, he's not, Cynthia.

1799
01:56:28,166 --> 01:56:29,233
Not allowed.

1800
01:56:29,333 --> 01:56:30,900
Would you like some mustard, Paul?

1801
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:32,400
Oh, that's lovely.

1802
01:56:32,500 --> 01:56:34,608
Can't get rid of it, can ya?

1803
01:56:34,708 --> 01:56:37,191
Oh, it's a real communal thing, eating.

1804
01:56:37,291 --> 01:56:38,574
Yes.

1805
01:56:39,750 --> 01:56:41,525
This is a lovely house.

1806
01:56:41,625 --> 01:56:43,066
Well, we like it.

1807
01:56:43,166 --> 01:56:46,275
- I'll show you round later, if you want.
- Yeah. Thanks, that'd be nice.

1808
01:56:46,375 --> 01:56:48,365
Yeah. It's brilliant.

1809
01:56:49,416 --> 01:56:51,733
- Do you live in a flat, then, Hortense?
- Yeah.

1810
01:56:51,833 --> 01:56:54,400
Yeah, it's her own.
She's got a mortgage and everything.

1811
01:56:54,500 --> 01:56:56,066
Whereabouts are you?

1812
01:56:56,166 --> 01:56:57,699
Kilburn.

1813
01:56:57,833 --> 01:56:59,150
That's a bit of a schlepp, innit?

1814
01:56:59,250 --> 01:57:00,775
The Old Kent Road, and back every day?

1815
01:57:00,875 --> 01:57:03,574
- I just get on the Tube.
- She drives!

1816
01:57:03,958 --> 01:57:06,115
I drive to the station.

1817
01:57:07,083 --> 01:57:09,233
- You've got a bedsit, ain't you, Paul?
- Yeah, that's right.

1818
01:57:09,333 --> 01:57:12,608
- Oh, that's a shame.
- Wish I had a place of me own.

1819
01:57:12,708 --> 01:57:14,316
Do you still live at home, then?

1820
01:57:14,416 --> 01:57:15,816
No chance.

1821
01:57:15,916 --> 01:57:18,233
So, do you two work on the same machine?

1822
01:57:18,333 --> 01:57:21,566
No. I'm the only one on slits.

1823
01:57:25,291 --> 01:57:27,108
Do you choose
your own working hours, then, Roxanne?

1824
01:57:27,208 --> 01:57:28,191
Not bloody likely.

1825
01:57:28,291 --> 01:57:30,358
Just biding her time
till you go to college, aren't you?

1826
01:57:30,458 --> 01:57:33,775
- Oh, I ain't goin' to college.
- Hortense went to college.

1827
01:57:33,875 --> 01:57:36,032
Oh, what did you study?

1828
01:57:36,666 --> 01:57:37,900
Optometry.

1829
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:39,150
What's that, then?

1830
01:57:39,250 --> 01:57:41,066
- It's to do with the eye, isn't it?
- That's right.

1831
01:57:41,166 --> 01:57:43,032
Testing.

1832
01:57:43,375 --> 01:57:45,525
And you've given it
all up now, have you?

1833
01:57:45,625 --> 01:57:46,608
Not exactly.

1834
01:57:46,708 --> 01:57:50,699
What are you doing working
in a cardboard box factory, then?

1835
01:57:50,875 --> 01:57:52,816
- I'm doing research.
- Oh!

1836
01:57:52,916 --> 01:57:56,199
That's interesting.
What sort of research?

1837
01:57:56,333 --> 01:57:58,358
- Medical.
- What, you lookin' at her head?

1838
01:57:59,666 --> 01:58:01,449
Take no notice.

1839
01:58:02,458 --> 01:58:04,483
There's nothing wrong with her head.

1840
01:58:04,583 --> 01:58:06,650
- D'you go to university?
- Yeah.

1841
01:58:06,750 --> 01:58:08,608
- D'you do a degree?
- Yes, I did.

1842
01:58:08,708 --> 01:58:10,816
She just looks at our eyes, don't you?

1843
01:58:10,916 --> 01:58:13,615
- Yes, I do.
- What for?

1844
01:58:13,958 --> 01:58:17,025
Well, you can tell a lot about people
from looking at their eyes.

1845
01:58:17,125 --> 01:58:18,650
- That's true.
- Can you?

1846
01:58:18,750 --> 01:58:20,566
Windows to your soul.

1847
01:58:20,666 --> 01:58:22,358
That's a nice way of puttin' it, Jane.

1848
01:58:22,458 --> 01:58:23,483
It's true, though, ain't it?

1849
01:58:23,583 --> 01:58:25,400
Right. Who wants a top-up? Hortense?

1850
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:27,775
- No, thanks, I'm driving.
- Yes, please, sweetheart.

1851
01:58:27,875 --> 01:58:29,150
- Here y'are, Maurice.
- Oi, greedy guts.

1852
01:58:30,375 --> 01:58:34,108
You wanna take a leaf out of
her book, Paul. Lost his licence.

1853
01:58:34,208 --> 01:58:35,608
All right, Mum.

1854
01:58:35,708 --> 01:58:39,233
- Why, d'you have an accident, Paul?
- Just had one too many, that's all.

1855
01:58:39,333 --> 01:58:40,441
- There you go.
- Oh, shame.

1856
01:58:40,541 --> 01:58:42,066
The demon drink?

1857
01:58:42,166 --> 01:58:43,775
Is that who you've been
going out with, then?

1858
01:58:43,875 --> 01:58:45,157
Yes.

1859
01:58:45,375 --> 01:58:48,233
She thought I'd been seeing a bloke.

1860
01:58:48,333 --> 01:58:50,858
Could've been, I suppose.
I can still turn a few heads.

1861
01:58:50,958 --> 01:58:53,150
Turn stomachs.

1862
01:58:53,931 --> 01:58:55,115
Jane!

1863
01:58:55,833 --> 01:58:57,066
It's gone off now.

1864
01:58:57,166 --> 01:58:58,900
Here, do you want one, Hortense?

1865
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,191
Oh, well, we might as well
pop the lot, then.

1866
01:59:01,291 --> 01:59:02,858
No!

1867
01:59:02,958 --> 01:59:04,240
Oh, it's like a bonfire.

1868
01:59:04,875 --> 01:59:08,324
Happy birthday to you

1869
01:59:08,791 --> 01:59:12,532
Happy birthday to you

1870
01:59:13,208 --> 01:59:15,900
- Happy birthday, dear Roxy
- Happy birthday, dear stinker

1871
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:17,441
Oh, yeah, Maurice, very funny!

1872
01:59:17,541 --> 01:59:18,775
Happy birthday to you

1873
01:59:18,875 --> 01:59:20,324
Join in!

1874
01:59:22,791 --> 01:59:24,316
Nice one, champagne.

1875
01:59:24,416 --> 01:59:26,191
Oh, I need my camera.
Did anybody bring it in?

1876
01:59:26,291 --> 01:59:28,025
- I did. It's there, Monica.
- Do you have to, Monica?

1877
01:59:28,125 --> 01:59:29,900
Of course I have to.

1878
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:31,275
Watch where you point that, Maurice.

1879
01:59:31,375 --> 01:59:33,233
Right, all under cover, okay?

1880
01:59:33,333 --> 01:59:34,983
- And, oops!
- Oh.

1881
01:59:35,083 --> 01:59:36,691
- Yay!
- Come on...

1882
01:59:36,791 --> 01:59:38,108
- Blow your candles out, Roxanne.
- Oh.

1883
01:59:38,208 --> 01:59:40,566
- Everybody else gather round. Come on.
- Come on, darlin'.

1884
01:59:40,666 --> 01:59:42,733
All right, Cynth,
you tuck in there. Okay?

1885
01:59:42,833 --> 01:59:45,025
Hortense in there.
Right, come round here, Paul.

1886
01:59:45,125 --> 01:59:46,775
Hurry up, it's burning me eyebrows off.

1887
01:59:46,875 --> 01:59:48,691
Right, make a wish. One big blow.

1888
01:59:48,791 --> 01:59:50,358
- And...
- Cheese!

1889
01:59:50,458 --> 01:59:51,740
Hey!

1890
01:59:52,333 --> 01:59:54,199
I hope your wish comes true, pet.

1891
01:59:54,333 --> 01:59:55,941
- Here you are, Roxy.
- Ta.

1892
01:59:56,041 --> 01:59:58,191
- All right, Cynth.
- There you are, sweetheart.

1893
01:59:58,291 --> 02:00:00,733
- Oh, that's nice.
- And Paul.

1894
02:00:00,833 --> 02:00:03,525
- Jane.
- All right. Cynth, again.

1895
02:00:03,625 --> 02:00:05,400
Thank you, Maurice.

1896
02:00:05,500 --> 02:00:06,858
Oh, this is livin', ain't it?

1897
02:00:06,958 --> 02:00:08,650
Ooh, yeah.

1898
02:00:08,750 --> 02:00:10,691
Okay. One for me.

1899
02:00:10,791 --> 02:00:12,282
All right.

1900
02:00:13,916 --> 02:00:15,233
On you go, then.

1901
02:00:15,333 --> 02:00:17,949
Oh, yeah, okay.

1902
02:00:20,041 --> 02:00:22,400
I would like to propose a toast...

1903
02:00:22,500 --> 02:00:25,532
For Roxanne on her 21 st birthday.

1904
02:00:26,208 --> 02:00:29,615
Now, it's all legal,
and twice as boring for it.

1905
02:00:30,500 --> 02:00:32,150
Mind you, it's been legal
since you I were 18, anyway,

1906
02:00:32,250 --> 02:00:33,858
so I don't know what I'm talking about.

1907
02:00:33,958 --> 02:00:35,775
- Happy birthday, sweetheart.
- Ta.

1908
02:00:35,875 --> 02:00:37,074
Roxanne...

1909
02:00:38,375 --> 02:00:39,657
Happy birthday.

1910
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:47,650
- There you go.
- What's that?

1911
02:00:47,750 --> 02:00:50,240
- Book token.
- Don't be stupid.

1912
02:00:53,916 --> 02:00:55,699
Fuckin' hell, Maurice.

1913
02:00:55,833 --> 02:00:56,983
Thanks!

1914
02:00:57,083 --> 02:00:58,358
Oh, well, it's your 21 st, isn't it?

1915
02:00:58,458 --> 02:01:00,441
Thanks, Monica.

1916
02:01:00,541 --> 02:01:02,490
Happy birthday, pet.

1917
02:01:03,041 --> 02:01:04,941
Don't spend it all in the one shop.

1918
02:01:05,041 --> 02:01:06,532
Here, happy birthday.

1919
02:01:07,166 --> 02:01:09,407
Wish I'd brought my present with me now.

1920
02:01:09,916 --> 02:01:12,358
You can give it to her tomorrow, can't you?
That's her birthday.

1921
02:01:12,458 --> 02:01:14,358
Yeah. I don't expect I shall
see her tomorrow.

1922
02:01:14,458 --> 02:01:16,949
Are you gonna sit down, darlin'?

1923
02:01:17,083 --> 02:01:18,900
Yes, come and sit down.
Everybody, have some cake.

1924
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,233
- There you are. Hortense? Jane?
- Everybody, get stuck in.

1925
02:01:21,333 --> 02:01:22,441
Where am I going?

1926
02:01:22,541 --> 02:01:24,865
Anywhere you like.

1927
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:30,407
- Come on the end, Paul.
- Hortense.

1928
02:01:34,458 --> 02:01:35,699
Where's the bathroom?

1929
02:01:36,208 --> 02:01:37,733
It's just through there, sweetheart.

1930
02:01:37,833 --> 02:01:38,983
Yeah, it's the door straight ahead,

1931
02:01:39,083 --> 02:01:41,615
- and the light's on the left.
- Thank you. Yeah.

1932
02:02:07,208 --> 02:02:08,449
She's a nice girl.

1933
02:02:09,833 --> 02:02:11,824
Yeah, she is, Maurice.

1934
02:02:12,458 --> 02:02:14,824
- Seems very pleasant.
- Yeah, she's all right.

1935
02:02:15,333 --> 02:02:16,900
- How are you doing, Paul?
- All right.

1936
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,240
- Oh, has your shirt dried off now?
- Yeah, it's fine.

1937
02:02:23,958 --> 02:02:25,865
She takes after her mother.

1938
02:02:26,791 --> 02:02:29,990
- Does she?
- D'you know her as well?

1939
02:02:31,041 --> 02:02:33,949
Work at the factory, does she?

1940
02:02:34,625 --> 02:02:36,324
You're lookin' at her.

1941
02:02:38,375 --> 02:02:40,240
She's my daughter.

1942
02:02:46,625 --> 02:02:47,949
What's the matter with ya?

1943
02:02:48,416 --> 02:02:50,066
Maurice...

1944
02:02:50,166 --> 02:02:52,115
It's me daughter.

1945
02:02:53,125 --> 02:02:54,907
Don't be stupid.

1946
02:02:55,708 --> 02:02:57,816
She's had too much to drink.

1947
02:03:01,708 --> 02:03:03,240
She can't be the one that...

1948
02:03:06,875 --> 02:03:08,115
What?

1949
02:03:09,958 --> 02:03:12,157
Hortense, sweetheart...

1950
02:03:13,833 --> 02:03:16,370
She's your sister.

1951
02:03:19,583 --> 02:03:20,907
What?

1952
02:03:22,333 --> 02:03:25,074
That's her half-sister, Paul!

1953
02:03:36,291 --> 02:03:39,199
- You eat your cake, sweetheart.
- Thanks.

1954
02:03:40,333 --> 02:03:42,740
- What's the matter?
- I'm all right, darlin'.

1955
02:03:48,333 --> 02:03:49,865
I told 'em.

1956
02:03:56,333 --> 02:03:58,907
Tell 'em who you are, sweetheart.

1957
02:04:02,958 --> 02:04:04,907
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.

1958
02:04:05,083 --> 02:04:08,365
Yeah, well, it has, ain't it,
so you tell 'em. Go on.

1959
02:04:12,625 --> 02:04:14,240
Is it true?

1960
02:04:14,541 --> 02:04:16,074
Yes, it is.

1961
02:04:18,666 --> 02:04:22,449
- You never told her, then?
- I'm sorry, darlin'.

1962
02:04:23,458 --> 02:04:25,650
Will someone tell me
what the fuck's goin' on?

1963
02:04:25,750 --> 02:04:27,907
She's your sister!

1964
02:04:31,166 --> 02:04:32,365
Maurice?

1965
02:04:35,750 --> 02:04:36,949
Monica?

1966
02:04:38,791 --> 02:04:41,490
I always said she had a right to know.

1967
02:04:44,041 --> 02:04:46,983
Look, Roxanne, sweetheart!
Darlin', darlin', please!

1968
02:04:47,083 --> 02:04:50,775
Don't you touch me, or I will smack you,
you slag! You fucking slag!

1969
02:04:50,875 --> 02:04:53,941
Ain't it enough you had one bastard?
You had to have two and all?

1970
02:04:54,041 --> 02:04:57,407
Stop it! Roxanne? Roxy?

1971
02:04:58,916 --> 02:05:01,358
Sit down, darlin'. Sit down, Paul.

1972
02:05:06,958 --> 02:05:08,316
Cynthia, I think I should go.

1973
02:05:08,416 --> 02:05:11,865
No, I don't want you to go, darlin'.
You sit down.

1974
02:05:12,708 --> 02:05:14,699
Eat your cake, Jane.

1975
02:05:14,958 --> 02:05:17,115
You don't half-choose
your moments, Cynthia.

1976
02:05:17,416 --> 02:05:21,240
Well, when's the right moment, Maurice?
You tell me that.

1977
02:05:22,333 --> 02:05:24,150
- Paul, get my coat. We're going.
- Oh, don't go.

1978
02:05:24,250 --> 02:05:26,191
- Why didn't you tell me, Maurice?
- I thought you knew.

1979
02:05:26,291 --> 02:05:28,233
- You used to tell me everything!
- I'm sorry.

1980
02:05:28,333 --> 02:05:31,150
- Well, you've fuckin' well let me down!
- Oh, don't say that.

1981
02:05:31,250 --> 02:05:33,566
As for you, well,
thanks for the present!

1982
02:05:33,666 --> 02:05:36,733
You've ruined my party,
and I hope you're happy!

1983
02:05:36,833 --> 02:05:38,740
Roxy... Roxanne?

1984
02:06:00,083 --> 02:06:01,740
She don't mean it, darlin'.

1985
02:06:02,541 --> 02:06:04,407
She's just little bit upset.

1986
02:06:22,208 --> 02:06:23,949
- Where are you goin'?
- I don't know.

1987
02:06:25,958 --> 02:06:28,816
It's all been a bit of a shock, innit?

1988
02:06:28,916 --> 02:06:30,824
Look, I don't get it.
Did you know about her?

1989
02:06:32,416 --> 02:06:34,240
I always thought she'd had a boy.

1990
02:06:34,583 --> 02:06:36,733
- She's a slag. Yes, she fuckin' is!
- No, she's not.

1991
02:06:36,833 --> 02:06:39,240
She loves ya. We all love ya.

1992
02:06:40,583 --> 02:06:42,400
- You coming back?
- No.

1993
02:06:42,500 --> 02:06:43,733
- You got to.
- Why should I?

1994
02:06:43,833 --> 02:06:44,816
You gotta face up to it.

1995
02:06:44,916 --> 02:06:46,699
Face up to what?

1996
02:06:51,875 --> 02:06:54,240
She's left her card.

1997
02:06:54,958 --> 02:06:57,990
Oh, well, I'll post it on to her.

1998
02:06:58,500 --> 02:07:00,574
I'll take it.

1999
02:07:00,958 --> 02:07:03,525
The state she's in, you'll be lucky
if you ever see her again.

2000
02:07:03,625 --> 02:07:05,983
Oh, you'd like that,
wouldn't you, sweetheart?

2001
02:07:06,083 --> 02:07:07,108
Would I?

2002
02:07:07,208 --> 02:07:10,615
You've been workin' at it
for 18 years, ain't you, Monica?

2003
02:07:11,750 --> 02:07:14,066
You turned my father against me.

2004
02:07:14,166 --> 02:07:16,441
You turned my Maurice against me,

2005
02:07:16,541 --> 02:07:18,358
and you turned me daughter against me.

2006
02:07:18,458 --> 02:07:21,240
You'll be havin' a go
at her next, I expect.

2007
02:07:21,416 --> 02:07:24,691
I'm sorry about this, Hortense.
You finished now, Jane?

2008
02:07:24,791 --> 02:07:26,108
Why don't you sit down?

2009
02:07:26,208 --> 02:07:28,650
You got a short memory, ain't ya?

2010
02:07:28,750 --> 02:07:30,066
What are you talkin' about now?

2011
02:07:30,166 --> 02:07:31,233
You wouldn't have none of this

2012
02:07:31,333 --> 02:07:34,150
if I hadn't given Maurice
the money to start with!

2013
02:07:34,250 --> 02:07:35,775
That money wasn't yours to give!

2014
02:07:35,875 --> 02:07:38,900
- That was your father's insurance money!
- That money was for me and Roxanne.

2015
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:40,025
And Maurice!

2016
02:07:40,125 --> 02:07:42,775
He didn't want none of it
till he come home and talked to you!

2017
02:07:42,875 --> 02:07:44,358
He was entitled to it!

2018
02:07:44,458 --> 02:07:47,025
I was going out cleaning
at 5:00 in the morning,

2019
02:07:47,125 --> 02:07:48,650
coming home, taking her to school!

2020
02:07:48,750 --> 02:07:50,858
And then going out again
to do a full day's work!

2021
02:07:50,958 --> 02:07:52,358
And didn't we know it!

2022
02:07:52,458 --> 02:07:56,191
You've done nothing but spend his money
since the day you clapped eyes on him!

2023
02:07:56,291 --> 02:07:59,191
Well, what are you supposed to do
with money but spend it?

2024
02:07:59,291 --> 02:08:01,108
At least we've made
something of ourselves!

2025
02:08:01,208 --> 02:08:02,525
Oh, haven't you just...

2026
02:08:02,625 --> 02:08:05,824
You want to try bringing up
a kid on your own!

2027
02:08:13,125 --> 02:08:16,358
She can't help it.
She's never had enough love.

2028
02:08:16,458 --> 02:08:17,483
And you've never got on.

2029
02:08:17,583 --> 02:08:20,407
- That ain't my fault.
- I know, I know.

2030
02:08:21,125 --> 02:08:22,990
But she needs ya.

2031
02:08:23,833 --> 02:08:26,074
- Come on.
- I don't want to.

2032
02:08:27,041 --> 02:08:29,100
What do you think, Paul?

2033
02:08:29,200 --> 02:08:31,275
I think he's right, darling.

2034
02:08:31,375 --> 02:08:32,733
Do you?

2035
02:08:32,833 --> 02:08:34,199
Yeah.

2036
02:08:35,500 --> 02:08:37,025
Well, I ain't sayin' nothin'.

2037
02:08:37,125 --> 02:08:38,733
You won't have to.

2038
02:08:38,833 --> 02:08:41,449
You just have to listen. Come on.

2039
02:08:57,750 --> 02:09:00,115
I'm sorry, Roxanne.

2040
02:09:00,833 --> 02:09:03,074
It just came out, darlin'.

2041
02:09:03,541 --> 02:09:05,733
I didn't mean to spoil your party.

2042
02:09:05,833 --> 02:09:08,441
- Tell her, Maurice!
- Now, leave her alone, Cynth.

2043
02:09:08,541 --> 02:09:09,907
Just tell her the truth.

2044
02:09:12,083 --> 02:09:13,574
Darlin'...

2045
02:09:16,666 --> 02:09:19,615
I got pregnant when I was 15.

2046
02:09:21,083 --> 02:09:25,324
And your granddad sent me away
to this place, didn't he, Maurice?

2047
02:09:26,291 --> 02:09:29,990
I didn't know she was
gonna come lookin' for me, did I?

2048
02:09:31,458 --> 02:09:33,316
But I gotta tell you the truth, darlin',

2049
02:09:33,416 --> 02:09:35,282
I'm glad she did.

2050
02:09:36,666 --> 02:09:40,025
It ain't her fault, sweetheart!
She didn't even wanna come!

2051
02:09:40,125 --> 02:09:43,365
She didn't wanna hurt you,
no more than I did!

2052
02:09:44,583 --> 02:09:46,400
Oh, you tell her, sweetheart.

2053
02:09:46,500 --> 02:09:49,549
It's true. She didn't wanna upset you.

2054
02:09:51,595 --> 02:09:52,824
I'm sorry.

2055
02:09:56,750 --> 02:09:58,282
All right?

2056
02:10:00,041 --> 02:10:02,449
She said you weren't
never gonna come back.

2057
02:10:03,791 --> 02:10:05,608
Who did?

2058
02:10:05,708 --> 02:10:08,900
I never said any such thing.
She's twisted everything as usual.

2059
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,233
Yes, you did, Monica.

2060
02:10:11,333 --> 02:10:12,775
Well, you was wrong, wasn't ya?

2061
02:10:12,875 --> 02:10:15,775
'Cause she has come back,
ain't you, sweetheart?

2062
02:10:15,875 --> 02:10:18,657
I always thought
you should've known, Roxanne.

2063
02:10:19,125 --> 02:10:20,233
You should've told her, Cynth.

2064
02:10:20,333 --> 02:10:22,733
Of course I should've told her, Maurice.

2065
02:10:22,833 --> 02:10:26,483
But I didn't think
there was ever gonna be no need to.

2066
02:10:26,583 --> 02:10:28,941
You seem to have told all and sundry.

2067
02:10:29,041 --> 02:10:30,983
Meaning me, I suppose.

2068
02:10:31,083 --> 02:10:33,358
And why shouldn't he?
I am his wife, after all!

2069
02:10:33,458 --> 02:10:35,608
Then why don't you behave like his wife?

2070
02:10:35,708 --> 02:10:36,733
What?

2071
02:10:36,833 --> 02:10:38,483
Why ain't you give him no kids?

2072
02:10:38,583 --> 02:10:40,983
- Be quiet, Cynthia.
- That's between Maurice and me.

2073
02:10:41,083 --> 02:10:43,941
You're so selfish, Monica.
You might not've wanted them,

2074
02:10:44,041 --> 02:10:45,066
- but he did.
- Shut up, Mum!

2075
02:10:45,166 --> 02:10:46,400
You don't know
what you're talkin' about.

2076
02:10:46,500 --> 02:10:47,691
- Don't I?
- There's things

2077
02:10:47,791 --> 02:10:49,157
- you know nothing about.
- Maurice.

2078
02:10:49,333 --> 02:10:50,865
Like what?

2079
02:10:56,333 --> 02:10:57,532
Tell her.

2080
02:11:02,291 --> 02:11:03,490
Tell me what?

2081
02:11:05,291 --> 02:11:07,407
Why can't you tell her?

2082
02:11:14,041 --> 02:11:17,532
She can't have kids. Simple as that.

2083
02:11:18,333 --> 02:11:21,574
She's physically incapable
of having children.

2084
02:11:22,416 --> 02:11:25,316
We've had every test
known to medical science.

2085
02:11:25,416 --> 02:11:28,108
She's been pushed around,
prodded, poked, had operations.

2086
02:11:28,208 --> 02:11:31,740
We've had 15 years of it,
and she can't have a baby.

2087
02:11:33,125 --> 02:11:35,115
I love you to bits...

2088
02:11:36,458 --> 02:11:40,782
But it's almost destroyed our relationship.
You know it has.

2089
02:11:44,875 --> 02:11:46,365
There...

2090
02:11:47,625 --> 02:11:49,449
I've said it.

2091
02:11:50,541 --> 02:11:53,157
So where's the bolt of lightning?

2092
02:11:56,791 --> 02:11:58,657
Secrets and lies.

2093
02:12:00,791 --> 02:12:04,949
We're all in pain.
Why can't we share our pain?

2094
02:12:07,250 --> 02:12:10,191
I've spent my entire life
trying to make people happy!

2095
02:12:10,291 --> 02:12:13,900
And the three people I love the most
in the world hate each other's guts!

2096
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:17,199
I'm in the middle,
I can't take it any more!

2097
02:12:27,416 --> 02:12:28,782
I'm sorry, Hortense.

2098
02:12:29,458 --> 02:12:31,150
You are a very brave person.

2099
02:12:31,250 --> 02:12:34,115
- A very stupid person.
- No, you're not.

2100
02:12:35,041 --> 02:12:36,066
You wanted to find the truth

2101
02:12:36,166 --> 02:12:39,490
and you were prepared
to suffer the consequences.

2102
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:43,824
And I admire you for that. I mean it.

2103
02:13:23,833 --> 02:13:26,074
You are so lucky, Cynthia.

2104
02:13:40,625 --> 02:13:42,816
So you'd really been working
in the factory?

2105
02:13:42,916 --> 02:13:44,199
No.

2106
02:13:45,833 --> 02:13:47,025
What do you do, then?

2107
02:13:47,125 --> 02:13:48,907
I'm an optometrist.

2108
02:13:53,541 --> 02:13:55,157
Welcome to the family.

2109
02:14:01,606 --> 02:14:05,990
Maurice...
I wish I'd had a dad like you.

2110
02:14:07,333 --> 02:14:09,032
You're lovely.

2111
02:14:18,833 --> 02:14:21,282
His name's Bingham.

2112
02:14:22,333 --> 02:14:24,032
Your father.

2113
02:14:25,916 --> 02:14:27,782
He's from America.

2114
02:14:30,041 --> 02:14:33,074
I met him on holiday. Benidorm.

2115
02:14:34,458 --> 02:14:36,574
He's a medical student.

2116
02:14:39,333 --> 02:14:43,199
And one morning I come down,
and he wasn't there no more.

2117
02:14:45,333 --> 02:14:47,449
But he was a nice man.

2118
02:14:50,083 --> 02:14:51,490
He was.

2119
02:15:00,458 --> 02:15:02,657
Was my father a nice man?

2120
02:15:03,875 --> 02:15:06,740
Oh, don't break my heart, darlin'.

2121
02:15:34,208 --> 02:15:35,907
I'm all right.

2122
02:15:54,291 --> 02:15:57,365
Oh, please, Roxanne, sweetheart!

2123
02:15:57,958 --> 02:15:59,824
Please!

2124
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:11,699
I'm frightened.

2125
02:16:13,708 --> 02:16:14,990
Why?

2126
02:16:17,458 --> 02:16:19,782
You don't love me any more.

2127
02:16:22,166 --> 02:16:24,199
Not like you used to.

2128
02:16:27,291 --> 02:16:28,907
Maurice...

2129
02:16:34,333 --> 02:16:37,032
You don't know how much I love you.

2130
02:16:39,291 --> 02:16:40,699
Do you?

2131
02:16:55,125 --> 02:16:57,740
We've got each other, haven't we?

2132
02:17:13,541 --> 02:17:16,082
Bet you've never seen
so much shit, have you?

2133
02:17:16,182 --> 02:17:18,157
You wanna see my mum's house.

2134
02:17:19,750 --> 02:17:21,532
Do you miss her?

2135
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:23,365
Yeah.

2136
02:17:24,375 --> 02:17:25,400
Did you get on with her?

2137
02:17:25,500 --> 02:17:27,275
She used to drive me mad.

2138
02:17:27,375 --> 02:17:29,025
That's what they're there for,
though, ain't it?

2139
02:17:29,125 --> 02:17:30,449
Yeah.

2140
02:17:30,791 --> 02:17:34,199
That's me old chair there.

2141
02:17:34,458 --> 02:17:36,574
I always wanted a little sister.

2142
02:17:38,416 --> 02:17:41,191
No, it's just that my brothers
were much older than me.

2143
02:17:41,291 --> 02:17:43,191
So I ended up playing on my own
most of the time.

2144
02:17:43,291 --> 02:17:45,449
Oh, I know what you mean.

2145
02:17:51,375 --> 02:17:53,365
What you laughing at?

2146
02:17:55,833 --> 02:17:58,282
Do you feel like we're sisters?

2147
02:17:58,833 --> 02:18:01,449
I don't know. Do you?

2148
02:18:04,583 --> 02:18:06,740
- It's a bit weird.
- Yeah.

2149
02:18:07,291 --> 02:18:10,400
- I don't mind it, though.
- No, nor do... Nor do I.

2150
02:18:10,500 --> 02:18:13,074
I don't even know you yet, do I?

2151
02:18:14,375 --> 02:18:15,858
D'you wanna go out one night?

2152
02:18:15,958 --> 02:18:17,865
Yeah, yeah.

2153
02:18:18,875 --> 02:18:20,358
You can take me to one of your pubs.

2154
02:18:20,458 --> 02:18:22,615
Yeah, all right.

2155
02:18:24,708 --> 02:18:26,532
How would you introduce me?

2156
02:18:27,333 --> 02:18:28,699
As your half-sister?

2157
02:18:29,083 --> 02:18:30,490
Yeah.

2158
02:18:32,208 --> 02:18:34,691
No, man. Too much explaining to do.

2159
02:18:34,791 --> 02:18:36,233
- That's what I'd say, though.
- Would ya?

2160
02:18:36,333 --> 02:18:37,574
Yeah.

2161
02:18:38,500 --> 02:18:40,983
Yeah. Best to tell the truth, innit?

2162
02:18:41,083 --> 02:18:42,699
Yeah, it is.

2163
02:18:43,291 --> 02:18:45,574
That way nobody gets hurt.

2164
02:18:49,833 --> 02:18:52,449
Here y'are, sweetheart. Tea's up.

2165
02:18:53,125 --> 02:18:54,865
Go on, darlin'.

2166
02:18:55,125 --> 02:18:57,150
- Want a biscuit?
- No, I'm all right, thank you.

2167
02:18:57,250 --> 02:18:59,275
Well, sit yourself down.

2168
02:18:59,375 --> 02:19:02,115
- Are you all right with that?
- Yeah.

2169
02:19:03,083 --> 02:19:04,615
That's it.

2170
02:19:09,833 --> 02:19:11,990
Who'd have thought it?

2171
02:19:13,291 --> 02:19:16,650
Look at you two, sittin' there
like a couple garden gnomes.

2172
02:19:24,333 --> 02:19:26,124
Oh, this is the life, ain't it?

2173
02:19:26,125 --> 02:19:27,699
Yeah.
