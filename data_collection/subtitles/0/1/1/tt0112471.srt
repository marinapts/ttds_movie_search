1
00:03:41,693 --> 00:03:44,605
Do you have any idea
what they were arguing about?

2
00:03:45,653 --> 00:03:48,008
- Do you speak English?
- Yeah.

3
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:51,006
No. I'm sorry,
my German is not very good.

4
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:57,808
Have you ever heard
that as couples get older...

5
00:03:57,893 --> 00:04:01,044
- they lose their ability to hear each other?
- No.

6
00:04:01,573 --> 00:04:05,771
Well, supposedly, men lose their ability
to hear higher-pitched sounds...

7
00:04:05,973 --> 00:04:08,692
and women eventually
lose hearing in the low end.

8
00:04:08,853 --> 00:04:11,526
- I guess they sort of nullify each other.
- I guess.

9
00:04:11,613 --> 00:04:14,173
Nature's way of allowing couples
to grow old together...

10
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:16,005
without killing each other.

11
00:04:17,773 --> 00:04:19,172
What are you reading?

12
00:04:20,813 --> 00:04:21,962
Yeah.

13
00:04:22,573 --> 00:04:23,767
How about you?

14
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:43,804
Look, I was thinking about going
to the lounge car sometime soon.

15
00:04:43,893 --> 00:04:46,282
- Would you like to come with me?
- Yeah.

16
00:04:47,533 --> 00:04:48,648
Okay.

17
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:09,443
How do you speak such good English?

18
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:12,093
I went to school for a summer
in Los Angeles.

19
00:05:12,653 --> 00:05:14,803
- It's fine here?
- Yeah, this is good.

20
00:05:15,453 --> 00:05:17,444
And I spent some time in London.

21
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:21,649
How do you speak such good English?

22
00:05:21,773 --> 00:05:23,365
Me? I'm American.

23
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,041
- You're American? Are you sure?
- Yeah.

24
00:05:27,653 --> 00:05:30,486
No, I'm joking. I knew you were American.

25
00:05:30,613 --> 00:05:33,764
And of course,
you don't speak any other language, right?

26
00:05:33,893 --> 00:05:35,565
Yeah, I get it.

27
00:05:35,653 --> 00:05:39,362
I'm the crude, dumb, vulgar American
who doesn't speak any other languages...

28
00:05:39,453 --> 00:05:40,886
who has no culture, right?

29
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:42,531
But I tried.

30
00:05:42,853 --> 00:05:46,562
I took French for four years in high school.
When I first got to Paris...

31
00:05:46,653 --> 00:05:50,123
I stood in line at the metro station.
I was practicing.

32
00:05:54,573 --> 00:05:55,892
Whatever.

33
00:05:58,573 --> 00:06:00,370
You know, and I get up there...

34
00:06:00,453 --> 00:06:03,570
and I look at this woman
and my mind goes completely blank.

35
00:06:03,653 --> 00:06:06,451
<i>And I say,
"Listen, I need a ticket to get to..."</i>

36
00:06:06,613 --> 00:06:08,331
<i>You know... So anyway...</i>

37
00:06:10,053 --> 00:06:11,691
So where are you headed?

38
00:06:12,213 --> 00:06:13,771
Well, back to Paris.

39
00:06:14,053 --> 00:06:17,841
- My classes start next week.
- You're still in school? Where do you go?

40
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:20,401
<i>- Yeah, La Sorbonne, you know?
- Sure.</i>

41
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:24,205
You're coming from Budapest?

42
00:06:24,293 --> 00:06:27,205
- Yeah, I was visiting my grandmother.
- How is she?

43
00:06:29,053 --> 00:06:30,168
She's okay.

44
00:06:30,253 --> 00:06:32,130
- She's all right?
- She's fine.

45
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:36,324
- How about you? Where are you going?
- I'm going to Vienna.

46
00:06:36,413 --> 00:06:37,732
Vienna? What's there?

47
00:06:37,813 --> 00:06:39,929
No idea. I'm flying out of there tomorrow.

48
00:06:40,013 --> 00:06:41,332
You're on holiday?

49
00:06:44,933 --> 00:06:47,003
I don't really know what I'm on.

50
00:06:47,093 --> 00:06:49,209
<i>I'm just traveling around...</i>

51
00:06:49,293 --> 00:06:52,365
I've been riding the trains
the past two, three weeks.

52
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,967
You were visiting friends
or just on your own?

53
00:06:55,413 --> 00:06:58,723
<i>- Yeah, I had a friend in Madrid, but...
- Madrid, that's nice.</i>

54
00:06:58,813 --> 00:07:01,771
Yeah, I got one of those Eurail passes,
is what I did.

55
00:07:01,853 --> 00:07:03,002
That's great.

56
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:07,770
So has this trip around Europe
been good for you?

57
00:07:07,853 --> 00:07:10,572
<i>Yeah, sure. It's been... It sucked.</i>

58
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:12,566
What?

59
00:07:14,453 --> 00:07:16,648
<i>It's had its... Well, I'll tell you...</i>

60
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:21,045
sitting for weeks on end looking out the
window has actually been kind of great.

61
00:07:22,653 --> 00:07:24,132
What do you mean?

62
00:07:25,093 --> 00:07:27,129
Well, you know, for instance...

63
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,966
you have ideas
that you ordinarily wouldn't have.

64
00:07:30,413 --> 00:07:32,369
- What kind of ideas?
- Want to hear one?

65
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:34,171
- Yeah, tell me.
- All right.

66
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:38,084
I have this idea, okay?
For a television show.

67
00:07:38,173 --> 00:07:40,403
Some friends of mine
are cable-access producers.

68
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,007
Do you know what that is, cable access?

69
00:07:44,293 --> 00:07:47,444
Anybody can produce a show real cheap,
and they have to put it on.

70
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:51,731
I have this idea for this show that'll last
24 hours a day for a year straight, right?

71
00:07:51,813 --> 00:07:55,408
What you do, is you get 365 people...

72
00:07:55,493 --> 00:07:57,370
from cities all over the world...

73
00:07:57,453 --> 00:08:00,365
to do these 24-hour documents
of real time.

74
00:08:00,453 --> 00:08:02,284
Capturing life as it's lived.

75
00:08:03,173 --> 00:08:06,529
You know, it would start
with a guy waking up in the morning...

76
00:08:06,613 --> 00:08:08,729
and taking the long shower...

77
00:08:09,373 --> 00:08:12,285
eating a little breakfast,
making a little coffee...

78
00:08:13,053 --> 00:08:14,281
<i>reading the paper...</i>

79
00:08:14,373 --> 00:08:16,807
Wait. All those mundane, boring things...

80
00:08:16,893 --> 00:08:19,361
everybody has to do every day
of their fucking life?

81
00:08:19,453 --> 00:08:21,808
I was going to say,
"The poetry of day-to-day life."

82
00:08:21,893 --> 00:08:25,044
But you say it the way you say it,
I'll say it the way I say it.

83
00:08:25,133 --> 00:08:27,044
- Think of it like this...
- Who's gonna watch?

84
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:30,842
Think about it like this.
Why is it that a dog sleeping in the sun...

85
00:08:30,933 --> 00:08:33,083
is so beautiful? It is. It's beautiful.

86
00:08:33,173 --> 00:08:35,368
But a guy standing at a bank machine...

87
00:08:35,453 --> 00:08:38,365
trying to take some money out,
looks like a complete moron?

88
00:08:38,453 --> 00:08:41,968
So it's like a National Geographic
program, but on people.

89
00:08:42,493 --> 00:08:43,482
Yeah.

90
00:08:44,253 --> 00:08:45,447
What do you think?

91
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:49,048
Yeah, I can see it. Like, 24 boring hours.

92
00:08:49,133 --> 00:08:53,126
Sorry. And a three-minute sex scene
where he falls asleep right after.

93
00:08:53,973 --> 00:08:58,683
Yeah, and that would be a great episode.
People would talk about that episode.

94
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:03,328
I mean, you and your friends
could do one in Paris if you wanted.

95
00:09:03,413 --> 00:09:08,089
I don't know. The key, the thing
that haunts me is the distribution.

96
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:12,405
Getting the tapes from town to town,
city to city, so that the play continues...

97
00:09:12,493 --> 00:09:16,327
because it'll have to play all the time,
or else it just wouldn't work.

98
00:09:17,653 --> 00:09:19,052
<i>Thank you.</i>

99
00:09:20,173 --> 00:09:21,288
Thanks.

100
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:25,526
You know what? Not service oriented.

101
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,293
Just an observation about Europe.

102
00:09:36,893 --> 00:09:39,851
You know, my parents
never really spoke of the possibility...

103
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:43,369
of my falling in love
or getting married or having children.

104
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,164
Even as a little girl...

105
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:49,563
they wanted me to think
as a future career, as a...

106
00:09:49,653 --> 00:09:52,531
interior designer or lawyer
or something like that.

107
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,607
I'd say to my dad, "I want to be a writer."

108
00:09:55,853 --> 00:09:57,605
And he'd say, "Journalist."

109
00:09:57,853 --> 00:10:02,210
I'd say, "I wanted to have a refuge
for stray cats." He'd say, "Veterinarian."

110
00:10:02,293 --> 00:10:05,763
I'd say, "I wanted to be an actress."
He'd say, "TV newscaster."

111
00:10:06,093 --> 00:10:07,765
It was this constant conversion...

112
00:10:07,853 --> 00:10:12,324
of my fanciful ambition into
these practical moneymaking ventures.

113
00:10:13,973 --> 00:10:17,090
I always had a pretty good
bullshit detector when I was a kid.

114
00:10:17,173 --> 00:10:19,448
I always knew
when they were lying to me.

115
00:10:19,533 --> 00:10:21,888
By the time I was in high school,
I was dead set...

116
00:10:21,973 --> 00:10:25,886
on listening to what everybody thought
I should be doing with my life...

117
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:28,527
and just kind of doing the opposite.

118
00:10:28,973 --> 00:10:31,441
<i>No one was ever mean about it. It's just...</i>

119
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:35,772
I could never get very excited
about other people's ambitions for my life.

120
00:10:37,093 --> 00:10:38,162
But you know what?

121
00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:41,609
If your parents never really,
fully contradict you about anything...

122
00:10:41,693 --> 00:10:44,446
and are basically nice and supportive...

123
00:10:45,093 --> 00:10:47,891
it makes it even harder
to officially complain.

124
00:10:47,973 --> 00:10:51,932
Even when they're wrong,
it's this passive-aggressive shit.

125
00:10:52,013 --> 00:10:54,447
You know what I mean? I hate it.

126
00:10:54,973 --> 00:10:56,486
I really hate it.

127
00:10:56,733 --> 00:10:58,291
Well, you know...

128
00:10:58,373 --> 00:11:01,809
despite all that kind of bullshit
that comes along with it...

129
00:11:02,573 --> 00:11:05,565
I remember childhood as this...

130
00:11:06,413 --> 00:11:09,052
magical time. I do.

131
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:12,921
I remember when my mother
first told me about death.

132
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,528
My great-grandmother had just died...

133
00:11:15,613 --> 00:11:18,047
and my whole family
had visited them in Florida.

134
00:11:18,133 --> 00:11:20,693
I was about three,
three-and-a-half years old.

135
00:11:20,773 --> 00:11:23,845
Anyway, I was in the back yard, playing...

136
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:27,243
and my sister had just taught me
how to take the garden hose...

137
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,688
and do it in such a way that...

138
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:33,682
it sprayed into the sun
and would make a rainbow, right?

139
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,604
So I was doing that...

140
00:11:36,693 --> 00:11:39,412
and through the mist,
I could see my grandmother.

141
00:11:39,493 --> 00:11:43,202
She was just standing there,
smiling at me.

142
00:11:43,293 --> 00:11:46,251
And I held it there for a long time...

143
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:48,285
and I looked at her.

144
00:11:48,373 --> 00:11:51,843
Finally, I let go of the nozzle, you know?

145
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:55,323
Then I dropped the hose,
and she disappeared.

146
00:11:56,413 --> 00:11:58,927
So I run back inside and tell my parents.

147
00:11:59,173 --> 00:12:03,451
And they sit me down
and give me this big crap on...

148
00:12:04,213 --> 00:12:07,888
how when people die, you never see them
again, and how I'd imagined it.

149
00:12:07,973 --> 00:12:11,443
But I knew what I'd seen.
I was just glad that I saw that.

150
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:15,082
I mean, I've never seen
anything like that since. But, I don't know.

151
00:12:15,173 --> 00:12:19,405
It just kind of let me know
how ambiguous everything was.

152
00:12:19,493 --> 00:12:20,642
Even death.

153
00:12:22,213 --> 00:12:25,330
You're really lucky
you can have this attitude toward death.

154
00:12:27,253 --> 00:12:29,847
I think I'm afraid of death 24 hours a day.

155
00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:33,569
I swear. I mean,
that's why I'm in a train right now.

156
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:36,247
I could've flown to Paris,
but I'm too scared.

157
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,893
- Come on.
- I can't help it.

158
00:12:38,973 --> 00:12:42,124
I know the statistics say it's safer.
Whatever.

159
00:12:42,213 --> 00:12:45,444
When I'm in a plane, I can see it,
I can see the explosion.

160
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:47,728
I can see me falling through the clouds.

161
00:12:47,813 --> 00:12:52,091
And I'm so scared
of those few seconds of consciousness...

162
00:12:52,173 --> 00:12:55,609
before you're gonna die,
when you know for sure you're gonna die.

163
00:12:58,213 --> 00:13:00,124
I can't stop thinking that way.

164
00:13:00,733 --> 00:13:03,293
- It's exhausting.
- Yeah, I bet.

165
00:13:03,893 --> 00:13:05,292
Really exhausting.

166
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,483
- I think this is Vienna.
- Yeah.

167
00:13:12,933 --> 00:13:15,493
- You get off here, no?
- Yeah, what a drag.

168
00:13:16,053 --> 00:13:19,204
<i>I wish I'd met you earlier.
I really like talking to you.</i>

169
00:13:20,493 --> 00:13:21,767
Yeah, me, too.

170
00:13:22,493 --> 00:13:24,609
<i>It was really nice to meet you.</i>

171
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:58,570
<i>I have an admittedly insane idea,
but if I don't ask you this, it's just...</i>

172
00:13:58,653 --> 00:14:01,326
- It's gonna haunt me the rest of my life.
- What?

173
00:14:04,493 --> 00:14:08,725
<i>I want to keep talking to you.
I have no idea what your situation is...</i>

174
00:14:09,373 --> 00:14:13,252
but I feel like we have
some kind of connection. Right?

175
00:14:13,493 --> 00:14:14,846
Yeah, me, too.

176
00:14:14,933 --> 00:14:17,731
Great. Listen, here's the deal.
This is what we should do.

177
00:14:17,813 --> 00:14:20,486
Get off with me here in Vienna
and come check out the town.

178
00:14:20,573 --> 00:14:22,245
- What?
- Come on. It'll be fun.

179
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,812
- Come on.
- What would we do?

180
00:14:23,893 --> 00:14:27,408
I don't know. All I know is I have
to catch an Austrian Airlines flight...

181
00:14:27,493 --> 00:14:30,690
tomorrow morning at 9:30.
I don't have the money for a hotel...

182
00:14:30,773 --> 00:14:34,448
so I was just going to walk around,
and it'd be more fun if you came with me.

183
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:38,367
If I turn out to be some kind of psycho,
you just get on the next train.

184
00:14:38,453 --> 00:14:40,921
All right. Think of it like this.

185
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:46,246
Jump ahead 10, 20 years, okay?
And you're married.

186
00:14:46,573 --> 00:14:50,088
Only your marriage doesn't have
that same energy that it used to have.

187
00:14:50,173 --> 00:14:52,129
You start to blame your husband.

188
00:14:52,573 --> 00:14:55,451
You think about all those guys
you've met in your life...

189
00:14:55,533 --> 00:14:58,969
and what might've happened
if you'd picked up with one of them.

190
00:14:59,293 --> 00:15:01,284
Well, I'm one of those guys. That's me.

191
00:15:01,373 --> 00:15:03,284
So think of this as time travel...

192
00:15:03,373 --> 00:15:06,922
from then to now to find out
what you're missing out on.

193
00:15:07,013 --> 00:15:09,607
See, what this really could be
is a gigantic favor...

194
00:15:09,693 --> 00:15:13,606
to you and your future husband to find out
that you're not missing out anything.

195
00:15:13,693 --> 00:15:16,526
I'm just as big a loser as he is,
totally unmotivated, boring.

196
00:15:16,613 --> 00:15:19,252
And you made the right choice,
and you're happy.

197
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,732
Let me get my bag.

198
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,132
- We should get a locker for all this.
- Okay.

199
00:15:59,453 --> 00:16:00,772
What's your name?

200
00:16:00,853 --> 00:16:02,844
My name? It's Jesse.

201
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:05,601
It's James, actually,
but everybody calls me Jesse.

202
00:16:05,693 --> 00:16:07,888
You mean, Jesse James, no?

203
00:16:07,973 --> 00:16:10,282
- No, just Jesse.
- I'm Celine.

204
00:16:24,453 --> 00:16:26,728
- This is a nice bridge.
- Yeah.

205
00:16:31,373 --> 00:16:34,126
- This is kind of weird.
- This is kind of weird, isn't it?

206
00:16:34,213 --> 00:16:36,204
I mean, I feel a little awkward.

207
00:16:36,973 --> 00:16:38,452
But it's all right. Right?

208
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:41,331
This is great. Let's go to some places.
Look at your book.

209
00:16:41,413 --> 00:16:43,608
We're in Vienna, let's go to some places.

210
00:16:43,693 --> 00:16:45,251
- Let's ask these guys.
- Okay.

211
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,164
Excuse me?

212
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:50,770
<i>- Sprechen Sie English?
- Ja. Of course.</i>

213
00:16:50,853 --> 00:16:53,731
- Do you speak German for a change?
- What?

214
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:55,041
No, it was a joke.

215
00:16:55,133 --> 00:16:58,887
We just got into Vienna today,
and we're looking for something fun to do.

216
00:16:58,973 --> 00:17:00,770
<i>Like museums, exhibitions, things...</i>

217
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,572
But museums are not that funny anymore
these days.

218
00:17:04,413 --> 00:17:06,404
They are closing right now.

219
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,765
- How long are you going to be here?
- Just for tonight.

220
00:17:10,013 --> 00:17:13,130
Why did you come to Vienna?
What could you be expecting?

221
00:17:15,213 --> 00:17:16,646
We're on honeymoon.

222
00:17:17,733 --> 00:17:20,167
<i>Yeah, she got pregnant,
we had to get married...</i>

223
00:17:20,253 --> 00:17:22,369
<i>I don't believe you. You're a bad liar.</i>

224
00:17:28,053 --> 00:17:30,647
This is a play we're both in...

225
00:17:31,013 --> 00:17:33,527
<i>- and we would like to invite you.
- You're actors?</i>

226
00:17:33,613 --> 00:17:36,207
Not professional actors.
Part-time actors for fun.

227
00:17:36,293 --> 00:17:39,285
It's a play about a cow
and Indians searching for it.

228
00:17:39,373 --> 00:17:44,288
- There are also politicians, Mexicans...
- Russians, communists.

229
00:17:44,453 --> 00:17:47,923
- You have a real cow on stage?
- No, it's an actor in a cow costume.

230
00:17:48,013 --> 00:17:50,163
- He's the cow.
- Yes, I am the cow.

231
00:17:50,253 --> 00:17:53,165
- The cow's a bit weird.
- The cow has a disease.

232
00:17:53,253 --> 00:17:55,244
She's acting a bit strange. Like a dog.

233
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,564
If someone throws a stick,
she fetches it and brings it back.

234
00:17:58,653 --> 00:18:01,884
She can smoke with hoofs and everything.

235
00:18:01,973 --> 00:18:04,806
- Great.
- As you see, there is the address.

236
00:18:04,893 --> 00:18:08,124
- It's in the second district.
- Near the Prater. You know the Prater?

237
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:11,410
- The big Ferris wheel? We should go.
- The wheel, everybody knows...

238
00:18:11,493 --> 00:18:13,848
Perhaps you can go to the Prater
before the play.

239
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:16,447
It starts at 21:30.

240
00:18:17,133 --> 00:18:19,203
- 21:30?
- It's at 9:30.

241
00:18:19,293 --> 00:18:20,851
- 9:30.
- Right.

242
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,130
Great. What's the name of this play?

243
00:18:23,213 --> 00:18:27,252
<i>It translates as
Bring Me the Horns of Wilmington's Cow.</i>

244
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,766
I'm Wilmington's cow.

245
00:18:28,853 --> 00:18:30,366
- All right.
- Great.

246
00:18:30,453 --> 00:18:31,772
- You'll be there?
- We'll try.

247
00:18:31,853 --> 00:18:33,684
- I'm the cow.
- You're the cow.

248
00:18:33,773 --> 00:18:35,001
Goodbye.

249
00:18:54,453 --> 00:18:56,887
- All right, I got an idea. Are you ready?
- Yeah.

250
00:18:56,973 --> 00:18:59,771
It's Q and A time. We've known each other
a little while now.

251
00:18:59,853 --> 00:19:03,562
We're stuck together, so we'll ask
each other a few direct questions.

252
00:19:03,653 --> 00:19:06,451
- All right?
- So, we ask each other questions.

253
00:19:06,533 --> 00:19:09,001
Yeah. You have to answer 100% honestly.

254
00:19:09,093 --> 00:19:10,685
- Of course.
- Okay.

255
00:19:10,853 --> 00:19:12,605
All right, first question.

256
00:19:12,853 --> 00:19:15,048
<i>- You.
- Yes, I am going to ask you.</i>

257
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:18,728
Describe for me your first sexual feelings...

258
00:19:18,813 --> 00:19:20,610
towards a person.

259
00:19:21,773 --> 00:19:24,003
My first sexual feelings? Oh, my God.

260
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:27,361
I know.

261
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,530
Jean-Marc Fleury.

262
00:19:30,453 --> 00:19:32,011
Jean-Marc Fleury?

263
00:19:32,373 --> 00:19:35,922
We were at this summer camp together,
and he was a swimmer.

264
00:19:36,653 --> 00:19:39,531
He had bleached-out chlorine hair
and green eyes...

265
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:43,128
and to improve his times,
he'd shave the hair off his legs and arms.

266
00:19:43,213 --> 00:19:46,364
- That's disgusting.
- He was like this gorgeous dolphin.

267
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:48,683
My friend Emma had a big crush on him.

268
00:19:48,773 --> 00:19:52,243
So one day, I was cutting across
the field back to my room...

269
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,972
and he came walking up beside me.
I told him:

270
00:19:55,053 --> 00:19:58,409
<i>"You should date Emma
because she has a big crush on you."</i>

271
00:19:58,493 --> 00:20:00,165
He turned to me and said:

272
00:20:00,253 --> 00:20:03,450
<i>"Well, that's too bad,
because I have a big crush on you."</i>

273
00:20:04,293 --> 00:20:07,490
So, yeah,
it really scared the hell out of me...

274
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,609
because I thought he was so fine.

275
00:20:09,693 --> 00:20:13,845
Then he officially asked me out on a date.
I pretended I didn't like him.

276
00:20:15,573 --> 00:20:19,043
You know,
I was so afraid of what I might do.

277
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:24,968
So I went to see him swim a few times
at the swimming competition.

278
00:20:25,053 --> 00:20:27,886
He was so sexy. Really.
I mean, really sexy.

279
00:20:27,973 --> 00:20:32,489
We wrote these little declarations
of love at the end of the summer...

280
00:20:32,573 --> 00:20:35,565
and promised
we would keep writing forever...

281
00:20:35,653 --> 00:20:38,292
and meet again very soon...

282
00:20:38,373 --> 00:20:40,489
- Did you?
- Of course not.

283
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:45,844
Then this is the opportune time to tell you
that I happen to be a fantastic swimmer.

284
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,482
- Really?
- Yeah.

285
00:20:48,493 --> 00:20:50,245
- I make note of that.
- Okay.

286
00:20:50,853 --> 00:20:53,413
- So it's my turn. No?
- Yes, your turn.

287
00:20:56,453 --> 00:20:58,205
Have you ever been in love?

288
00:20:59,933 --> 00:21:01,924
Yes. Next question.

289
00:21:02,973 --> 00:21:04,565
- What was the...
- Wait a minute.

290
00:21:04,653 --> 00:21:06,689
- So I can give one-word answers?
- Why not?

291
00:21:06,773 --> 00:21:10,083
After I went into such private details
about my first sexual feelings.

292
00:21:10,173 --> 00:21:14,371
Those are two very different questions.
I could answer the sexual feelings thing.

293
00:21:14,453 --> 00:21:17,889
<i>But, you know, love...
I mean, what if I asked you about love?</i>

294
00:21:17,973 --> 00:21:21,602
I would have lied, but at least
I would have made up a great story.

295
00:21:21,933 --> 00:21:23,810
Love is a complex issue, you know?

296
00:21:23,893 --> 00:21:25,724
<i>I mean, it's like...</i>

297
00:21:25,813 --> 00:21:29,362
Yes, I've told somebody
that I love them before, and I've meant it.

298
00:21:29,453 --> 00:21:32,809
But was it totally unselfish, giving love?

299
00:21:32,893 --> 00:21:35,202
Was it a beautiful thing? Not really.

300
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:37,488
<i>You know, it's like, love...</i>

301
00:21:38,093 --> 00:21:39,845
I mean, I don't know.

302
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,367
You know?

303
00:21:42,493 --> 00:21:44,085
Yeah. I know what you mean.

304
00:21:44,173 --> 00:21:48,928
But as far as sexual feelings go
it started with an obsessive relationship...

305
00:21:49,173 --> 00:21:51,243
with Miss July, 1978.

306
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,369
<i>- You know Playboy magazine?
- I've heard of it.</i>

307
00:21:53,453 --> 00:21:54,772
- You know Crystal?
- No.

308
00:21:54,853 --> 00:21:57,413
You don't know Crystal?
Well, I knew Crystal.

309
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,244
Is it my turn now? Okay.

310
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,801
Tell me something
that really pisses you off.

311
00:22:03,893 --> 00:22:06,646
- Really drives you crazy.
- Pisses me off.

312
00:22:06,733 --> 00:22:09,406
- God, everything pisses me off.
- List a couple.

313
00:22:10,453 --> 00:22:13,763
I know. I hate being told by strange men...

314
00:22:13,853 --> 00:22:15,684
strange men in the street...

315
00:22:15,773 --> 00:22:20,244
you know, to smile to make them
feel better about their boring life.

316
00:22:20,813 --> 00:22:21,962
What else?

317
00:22:22,053 --> 00:22:23,247
<i>I hate...</i>

318
00:22:23,613 --> 00:22:26,889
I hate that 300 kilometers from here,
there's a war going on...

319
00:22:26,973 --> 00:22:29,646
people are dying,
and nobody knows what to do about it.

320
00:22:29,733 --> 00:22:31,849
Or they don't give a shit. I don't know.

321
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:35,642
I hate that the media's trying
to control our minds.

322
00:22:35,733 --> 00:22:37,246
- The media?
- Yeah, the media.

323
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:40,609
It's very subtle,
but it's a new form of fascism, really.

324
00:22:42,613 --> 00:22:43,682
<i>I hate...</i>

325
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:48,042
I hate when I'm in a foreign country,
especially in America, the worst...

326
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:52,490
each time I wear black or lose my temper
or say anything about anything...

327
00:22:52,693 --> 00:22:55,685
they always go,
"Oh, it's so French. It's so cute."

328
00:22:55,933 --> 00:22:58,731
I hate that. I can't stand that. Really.

329
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,402
Is that all?

330
00:23:01,533 --> 00:23:03,922
<i>Well, there's a lot of things, but...</i>

331
00:23:04,093 --> 00:23:06,084
- So it's my turn.
- Okay.

332
00:23:06,653 --> 00:23:08,928
- You're gonna answer.
- Yes, I'll answer.

333
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,685
What's a problem for you?

334
00:23:11,253 --> 00:23:12,527
You, probably.

335
00:23:12,693 --> 00:23:13,762
What?

336
00:23:14,813 --> 00:23:17,611
I had a thought the other day
that kind of...

337
00:23:17,693 --> 00:23:19,490
qualifies as a problem.

338
00:23:19,573 --> 00:23:20,608
What is it?

339
00:23:20,693 --> 00:23:23,366
<i>It was a thought I had on the train, so...</i>

340
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,092
Okay. All right.

341
00:23:25,373 --> 00:23:27,364
Do you believe in reincarnation?

342
00:23:27,693 --> 00:23:29,763
Yeah, it's interesting.

343
00:23:29,853 --> 00:23:34,085
A lot of people talk about past lives
and things like that, you know?

344
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:37,285
Even if they don't believe in it
in some specific way...

345
00:23:37,653 --> 00:23:40,008
people have a notion
of an eternal soul, right?

346
00:23:40,093 --> 00:23:41,082
- Yeah.
- Okay.

347
00:23:41,173 --> 00:23:45,769
This is my thought: 50,000 years ago
there's not even a million people.

348
00:23:45,853 --> 00:23:49,482
Ten thousand years ago, there's, like,
two million people on the planet.

349
00:23:49,573 --> 00:23:53,566
Now there's between
five and six billion people on the planet.

350
00:23:53,653 --> 00:23:58,204
If we all have our own individual,
unique soul...

351
00:23:58,693 --> 00:24:00,490
where did they all come from?

352
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:04,202
Are modern souls only a fraction
of the original souls?

353
00:24:04,293 --> 00:24:08,366
Because if they are, that represents
a 5,000 to one split of each soul...

354
00:24:08,453 --> 00:24:11,650
in just the last 50,000 years,
which is a blip in the Earth's time.

355
00:24:11,733 --> 00:24:15,009
At best, we're these tiny fractions...

356
00:24:15,373 --> 00:24:16,931
<i>of people walking...</i>

357
00:24:17,013 --> 00:24:21,052
Is that why we're so scattered?
Is that why we're so specialized?

358
00:24:21,133 --> 00:24:23,044
Wait a minute, I'm not sure. I don't...

359
00:24:23,133 --> 00:24:26,011
Yeah, I know.
It's a totally scattered thought.

360
00:24:27,373 --> 00:24:31,127
<i>- Which is kind of why it makes sense.
- Yeah, I agree with you.</i>

361
00:24:32,693 --> 00:24:34,570
Let's get off this damn train.

362
00:25:08,853 --> 00:25:11,367
- This place is pretty neat.
- Yeah.

363
00:25:11,893 --> 00:25:13,963
There's even a listening booth over there.

364
00:25:17,773 --> 00:25:19,764
Have you heard of this singer?

365
00:25:21,493 --> 00:25:23,961
I think she's American.
A friend told me about her.

366
00:25:24,053 --> 00:25:26,931
Do you want to go see
if that listening booth still works?

367
00:25:27,213 --> 00:25:28,282
Yeah, okay.

368
00:26:04,889 --> 00:26:09,287
There's a wind that blows in
from the north

369
00:26:09,566 --> 00:26:14,429
And it says that loving
takes this course

370
00:26:14,735 --> 00:26:17,283
Come here

371
00:26:19,213 --> 00:26:22,411
Come here

372
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:27,570
No, I'm not impossible
to touch

373
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:32,520
I have never wanted
you so much

374
00:26:32,986 --> 00:26:35,825
Come here

375
00:26:37,551 --> 00:26:40,136
Come here

376
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:46,023
Have I never laid
down by your side?

377
00:26:46,568 --> 00:26:51,005
Baby, let's forget
about this pride

378
00:26:51,433 --> 00:26:54,863
Come here

379
00:26:55,984 --> 00:26:59,046
Come here

380
00:27:03,973 --> 00:27:06,612
Look at this. This is beautiful.

381
00:27:13,093 --> 00:27:14,845
Quick. It's leaving.

382
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,293
Well I'm in no hurry

383
00:27:23,167 --> 00:27:27,371
You don't have to run
away this time

384
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:30,641
I know you're too timid

385
00:27:30,955 --> 00:27:35,763
But it's gonna be
all right this time

386
00:27:38,293 --> 00:27:39,931
Look, there's a rabbit.

387
00:27:40,373 --> 00:27:41,442
Yeah.

388
00:27:42,493 --> 00:27:43,972
Hey there, rabbit.

389
00:27:45,133 --> 00:27:46,566
It's so cute.

390
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:51,008
I visited this as a young teenager.

391
00:27:51,773 --> 00:27:54,128
It left a bigger impression on me
at that time...

392
00:27:54,213 --> 00:27:56,568
- than any of the museums we went to.
- Yeah?

393
00:27:56,653 --> 00:27:58,371
- It's tiny.
- I know.

394
00:27:59,013 --> 00:28:01,208
There was this little old man
that talked to us.

395
00:28:01,293 --> 00:28:02,521
He was the groundskeeper.

396
00:28:02,613 --> 00:28:05,411
He explained that
most of the people are buried here...

397
00:28:05,493 --> 00:28:07,927
that washed up on the bank of the Danube.

398
00:28:09,253 --> 00:28:10,811
How old are these?

399
00:28:11,093 --> 00:28:13,129
Around the beginning of the century or so.

400
00:28:13,213 --> 00:28:15,090
It's called the cemetery of the no-name...

401
00:28:15,173 --> 00:28:17,607
because they often didn't know
who these people were.

402
00:28:17,693 --> 00:28:19,809
Maybe a first name, that's all.

403
00:28:20,013 --> 00:28:21,890
Why were all the bodies washing up?

404
00:28:21,973 --> 00:28:25,852
I think some were from accidents
on boats and things like that.

405
00:28:25,933 --> 00:28:29,084
But most of them were suicides
that jumped in the river.

406
00:28:31,053 --> 00:28:34,728
I always liked the idea of all those
unknown people lost in the world.

407
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:36,929
When I was a little girl, I thought...

408
00:28:37,013 --> 00:28:39,607
if none of your family or friends
knew you were dead...

409
00:28:39,693 --> 00:28:41,684
then it's like not really being dead.

410
00:28:41,773 --> 00:28:44,651
<i>People can invent
the best and the worst for you.</i>

411
00:28:47,853 --> 00:28:49,923
Here she is, I think.

412
00:28:50,053 --> 00:28:52,886
Yeah, this is the one I remember the most.

413
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:58,483
She was only 13 when she died.

414
00:28:59,173 --> 00:29:03,530
That meant something to me, you know,
I was that age when I first saw this.

415
00:29:07,533 --> 00:29:11,651
Now I'm 10 years older,
and she's still 13, I guess.

416
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,692
That's funny.

417
00:29:33,853 --> 00:29:35,923
That's the Danube over there.

418
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:38,801
- That's a river, right?
- Yeah.

419
00:29:46,733 --> 00:29:48,052
This is...

420
00:29:48,533 --> 00:29:49,761
gorgeous.

421
00:29:50,773 --> 00:29:52,684
Yeah, this is beautiful.

422
00:29:58,773 --> 00:30:00,172
<i>I mean, we got...</i>

423
00:30:00,373 --> 00:30:02,011
We got a sunset here.

424
00:30:02,813 --> 00:30:05,043
- Yeah.
- We got the Ferris wheel.

425
00:30:06,973 --> 00:30:08,531
It seems like...

426
00:30:09,613 --> 00:30:11,012
<i>this would be a...</i>

427
00:30:12,773 --> 00:30:13,888
What?

428
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:18,848
<i>You know...</i>

429
00:30:23,933 --> 00:30:26,527
Are you trying to say you want to kiss me?

430
00:30:28,253 --> 00:30:29,288
Yeah?

431
00:31:32,653 --> 00:31:33,972
- But you know what?
- What?

432
00:31:34,053 --> 00:31:36,806
It doesn't matter what generation
you're born into.

433
00:31:36,893 --> 00:31:38,292
Look at my parents.

434
00:31:38,373 --> 00:31:42,412
They were angry, young May '68 people
revolting against everything.

435
00:31:42,493 --> 00:31:45,803
The government,
their conservative Catholic backgrounds.

436
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:50,008
I was born, and my father
went on to become a successful architect.

437
00:31:50,093 --> 00:31:54,644
We traveled around the world
while he built bridges, towers and stuff.

438
00:31:55,373 --> 00:31:57,967
I mean, I really can't complain
about anything.

439
00:31:58,173 --> 00:32:00,482
They love me more
than anything in the world...

440
00:32:00,573 --> 00:32:03,371
and I've been raised
with all the freedom they fought for.

441
00:32:03,613 --> 00:32:06,332
And yet, for me now,
it's another type of fight.

442
00:32:06,693 --> 00:32:10,129
We have to deal with the same old shit,
but we can't really know...

443
00:32:10,213 --> 00:32:12,727
who or, you know, what the enemy is.

444
00:32:13,213 --> 00:32:15,568
I don't know if there really is an enemy.

445
00:32:15,653 --> 00:32:17,609
Everybody's parents fucked them up.

446
00:32:17,693 --> 00:32:21,049
Rich kids' parents gave them too much.
Poor kids', not enough.

447
00:32:21,413 --> 00:32:23,722
Too much attention, not enough attention.

448
00:32:23,813 --> 00:32:27,010
They either left them
or they taught them the wrong things.

449
00:32:27,093 --> 00:32:30,881
My parents are just two people
who didn't like each other very much...

450
00:32:30,973 --> 00:32:32,850
who decided to get married
and have a kid.

451
00:32:32,933 --> 00:32:35,367
They tried their best to be nice to me.

452
00:32:36,293 --> 00:32:37,726
Did your parents divorce?

453
00:32:37,813 --> 00:32:40,532
Yeah, finally.
They should have done it a lot sooner.

454
00:32:40,613 --> 00:32:43,605
They stuck together
for the well-being of my sister and I.

455
00:32:43,693 --> 00:32:45,172
Thank you very much.

456
00:32:45,653 --> 00:32:49,043
I remember my mother once told me,
right in front of my father...

457
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,772
they were having a fight,
that he didn't want to have me.

458
00:32:51,853 --> 00:32:54,970
That he was pissed off
when he found out she was pregnant.

459
00:32:55,053 --> 00:32:58,648
That I was a big mistake.
That really shaped the way I think.

460
00:32:58,733 --> 00:33:02,646
I always saw the world as this place
where I really wasn't meant to be.

461
00:33:02,813 --> 00:33:03,962
That's so sad.

462
00:33:04,093 --> 00:33:07,403
Well, I mean,
I eventually kind of took pride in it.

463
00:33:07,493 --> 00:33:09,927
You know, like my life was my own doing,
or something.

464
00:33:10,013 --> 00:33:12,527
You know,
like I was crashing the big party.

465
00:33:13,213 --> 00:33:14,851
That's the way to see it.

466
00:33:15,173 --> 00:33:18,324
My parents are still married
and I guess they're happy.

467
00:33:19,013 --> 00:33:22,847
But I think it's a healthy process to rebel
against everything that came before.

468
00:33:22,933 --> 00:33:23,968
Yeah.

469
00:33:27,653 --> 00:33:30,087
You know, I've been wondering lately...

470
00:33:30,573 --> 00:33:33,485
do you know anyone
who's in a happy relationship?

471
00:33:34,973 --> 00:33:37,965
Yeah, sure.
You know, I know happy couples.

472
00:33:39,093 --> 00:33:41,209
But I think they lie to each other.

473
00:33:41,813 --> 00:33:42,928
Yeah.

474
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,929
People can live their whole life as a lie.

475
00:33:46,013 --> 00:33:48,288
My grandmother,
she was married to this man...

476
00:33:48,373 --> 00:33:51,285
and I always thought
she had a simply, uncomplicated love life.

477
00:33:51,373 --> 00:33:55,446
But she just confessed to me
that she spent her whole life...

478
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:58,525
dreaming about another man
she was always in love with.

479
00:33:58,613 --> 00:34:01,571
She just accepted her fate. It's so sad.

480
00:34:02,013 --> 00:34:05,164
In the same time, I love the idea
that she had all those emotions...

481
00:34:05,253 --> 00:34:07,483
and feelings I never thought
she would have had.

482
00:34:07,573 --> 00:34:09,768
I guarantee you it was better that way.

483
00:34:09,933 --> 00:34:13,289
If she'd known him,
he'd have disappointed her eventually.

484
00:34:13,373 --> 00:34:15,728
- How do you know? You don't know them.
- I know.

485
00:34:15,813 --> 00:34:18,486
People put romantic projections
on everything.

486
00:34:18,573 --> 00:34:20,848
It's not based on any kind of reality.

487
00:34:21,093 --> 00:34:22,731
- Romantic projections?
- Yeah.

488
00:34:22,813 --> 00:34:25,088
Mr. Romantic up in the Ferris wheel?

489
00:34:25,173 --> 00:34:27,926
"Oh, kiss me. The sunset.
Oh, it's so beautiful."

490
00:34:28,013 --> 00:34:31,562
All right. Tell me about your grandmother.
What were you saying about her?

491
00:34:48,693 --> 00:34:50,206
Check these guys out.

492
00:34:50,693 --> 00:34:52,604
"Hans, I have a confession to make.

493
00:34:52,693 --> 00:34:55,287
"I'm not wearing underwear
underneath this."

494
00:34:55,373 --> 00:34:57,933
"Oh, really? Does that frighten you?"

495
00:35:03,933 --> 00:35:06,163
- Can I tell you a secret?
- Yeah.

496
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:07,962
Come here.

497
00:35:08,093 --> 00:35:09,685
- What?
- Come here.

498
00:35:23,093 --> 00:35:26,085
Look at this palm reader.
She's interesting looking.

499
00:35:26,173 --> 00:35:27,208
Yeah.

500
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:30,972
- What?
- I just made eye contact.

501
00:35:31,053 --> 00:35:32,850
- She's not coming over here.
- She is.

502
00:35:32,933 --> 00:35:34,048
Shit.

503
00:35:37,013 --> 00:35:38,048
Oh, no.

504
00:35:38,653 --> 00:35:40,484
- You want your palm read?
- No.

505
00:35:40,573 --> 00:35:42,529
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

506
00:35:42,733 --> 00:35:44,166
- Okay.
- Hello.

507
00:35:44,813 --> 00:35:46,007
Here she is.

508
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:57,684
I want your palm read.

509
00:36:00,053 --> 00:36:01,771
Yeah. How much is it?

510
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:06,121
- For you, 50 schillings. Okay?
- Okay.

511
00:36:12,733 --> 00:36:15,167
So you have been on a journey...

512
00:36:15,693 --> 00:36:17,968
and you're a stranger to this place.

513
00:36:19,173 --> 00:36:21,403
You are an adventurer.

514
00:36:22,173 --> 00:36:23,447
A seeker.

515
00:36:24,693 --> 00:36:26,684
An adventurer in your mind.

516
00:36:31,373 --> 00:36:34,331
You are interested
in the power of the woman.

517
00:36:34,933 --> 00:36:39,484
In the woman's deep strength
and creativity.

518
00:36:39,773 --> 00:36:41,684
You're becoming this woman.

519
00:36:47,133 --> 00:36:50,967
You need to resign yourself
to the awkwardness of life.

520
00:36:52,053 --> 00:36:55,125
Only if you find peace within yourself...

521
00:36:55,933 --> 00:36:58,925
will you find true connection with others.

522
00:37:02,693 --> 00:37:04,411
That is a stranger to you?

523
00:37:04,573 --> 00:37:05,926
I guess so.

524
00:37:11,693 --> 00:37:14,082
You will be all right. He's learning.

525
00:37:15,013 --> 00:37:17,288
Okay. Money.

526
00:37:24,773 --> 00:37:27,890
You're both stars. Don't forget.

527
00:37:28,973 --> 00:37:31,885
When the stars exploded
billions of years ago...

528
00:37:31,973 --> 00:37:34,726
they formed everything that is this world.

529
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:37,487
Everything we know is stardust.

530
00:37:38,013 --> 00:37:41,323
So don't forget, you are stardust.

531
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:48,051
That's very nice and all.

532
00:37:48,133 --> 00:37:52,251
I mean, that we're all stardust,
and you're becoming this great woman.

533
00:37:53,173 --> 00:37:55,323
I hope you don't take that
any more seriously...

534
00:37:55,413 --> 00:37:58,325
than some horoscope
in a daily syndicated newspaper.

535
00:37:58,413 --> 00:37:59,926
What are you talking about?

536
00:38:00,013 --> 00:38:02,732
She knew I was on vacation
and we didn't know each other...

537
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:04,929
and that I was going
to become this great woman.

538
00:38:05,053 --> 00:38:08,125
But what was that
"I am learning" bullshit?

539
00:38:08,213 --> 00:38:12,092
That's way condescending, you know?
I mean, she wasn't even doing me.

540
00:38:12,693 --> 00:38:16,732
I mean, if opportunists
like that ever had to tell the real truth...

541
00:38:16,813 --> 00:38:18,929
it would put their asses out of business.

542
00:38:19,013 --> 00:38:22,130
I mean, just once
I'd love to see some little old lady...

543
00:38:22,213 --> 00:38:25,011
save up all her money
to go to the fortuneteller.

544
00:38:25,093 --> 00:38:29,450
She'd get there all excited about hearing
her future, and the woman would say:

545
00:38:30,173 --> 00:38:34,963
"Tomorrow and all your remaining days
will be exactly like today...

546
00:38:35,453 --> 00:38:37,887
"a tedious collection of hours.

547
00:38:37,973 --> 00:38:41,283
"And you will have no new passions
and no new thoughts...

548
00:38:41,373 --> 00:38:43,170
"and no new travels.

549
00:38:43,733 --> 00:38:46,247
"And when you die,
you'll be completely forgotten.

550
00:38:47,653 --> 00:38:50,406
"Fifty schillings, please."
That I'd like to see.

551
00:38:51,733 --> 00:38:53,325
It's so funny how...

552
00:38:53,533 --> 00:38:56,809
<i>she almost didn't notice you.
It's weird. I wonder why.</i>

553
00:38:56,893 --> 00:39:00,044
- She was really wise and intense.
- Yeah.

554
00:39:00,133 --> 00:39:02,328
- I really loved what she said.
- Of course you do.

555
00:39:02,413 --> 00:39:04,973
You pay to hear what makes
you feel good about yourself.

556
00:39:05,053 --> 00:39:08,523
Maybe there's a seedy section of Vienna.
We can buy a hit of crack.

557
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:11,969
<i>- Would you like that? Yeah?
- You're so...</i>

558
00:39:13,533 --> 00:39:15,364
Stardust.

559
00:39:24,533 --> 00:39:26,251
There's an exhibition.

560
00:39:27,253 --> 00:39:30,643
Yeah. I guess we'll miss it.
It doesn't start until next week.

561
00:39:31,413 --> 00:39:33,005
Yeah, I think so.

562
00:39:35,693 --> 00:39:38,605
I actually saw this one
a few years ago in a museum.

563
00:39:39,573 --> 00:39:41,291
I stared and stared at it.

564
00:39:41,653 --> 00:39:43,405
Must have been 45 minutes.

565
00:39:44,573 --> 00:39:45,642
I love it.

566
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:48,403
<i>La voie ferre. It's great.</i>

567
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:54,087
I love the way the people seem
to be dissolving into the background.

568
00:39:55,053 --> 00:39:56,406
Look at this one.

569
00:39:57,853 --> 00:40:01,129
It's like the environments
are stronger than the people.

570
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:06,245
His human figures
are always so transitory.

571
00:40:06,493 --> 00:40:08,449
It's funny. Transitory?

572
00:40:08,653 --> 00:40:10,006
Transitory.

573
00:40:28,563 --> 00:40:31,396
- You think this is open?
- I don't know. Let's try it.

574
00:40:56,803 --> 00:40:58,759
I was in an old church like this...

575
00:40:58,843 --> 00:41:01,994
with my grandmother
a few days ago in Budapest.

576
00:41:03,763 --> 00:41:06,641
Even though I reject
most of the religious thing...

577
00:41:06,803 --> 00:41:10,432
I can't help but feeling
for those people that come here...

578
00:41:10,763 --> 00:41:13,436
Iost or in pain, guilt...

579
00:41:14,683 --> 00:41:17,072
Iooking for some kind of answers.

580
00:41:18,363 --> 00:41:22,038
It fascinates me how a single place
can join so much pain and happiness...

581
00:41:22,123 --> 00:41:24,034
of so many generations.

582
00:41:24,643 --> 00:41:26,759
You're close with your grandmother?

583
00:41:28,563 --> 00:41:29,632
Yeah.

584
00:41:31,923 --> 00:41:35,199
I think it's because I always have
this strange feeling...

585
00:41:35,683 --> 00:41:38,834
that I'm this very old woman
laying down, about to die.

586
00:41:41,043 --> 00:41:44,638
You know, that my life
is just her memories or something.

587
00:41:48,683 --> 00:41:50,196
That's so wild.

588
00:41:52,163 --> 00:41:54,723
I always think
that I'm still this 13-year-old boy...

589
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:57,363
who doesn't really know
how to be an adult...

590
00:41:57,443 --> 00:41:59,718
pretending to live my life...

591
00:41:59,803 --> 00:42:02,636
taking notes for when
I'll really have to do it.

592
00:42:03,803 --> 00:42:06,761
Like I'm in a dress rehearsal
for a junior high play.

593
00:42:08,843 --> 00:42:10,242
That's funny.

594
00:42:11,003 --> 00:42:13,471
Then up there in the Ferris wheel,
it was like this...

595
00:42:13,563 --> 00:42:16,760
very old woman
kissing this very young boy. Right?

596
00:42:21,963 --> 00:42:25,353
Do you know anything about the Quakers,
the Quaker religion?

597
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:27,437
No, not much.

598
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:31,996
I went to this Quaker wedding once
and it was fantastic.

599
00:42:32,963 --> 00:42:34,282
What they do is...

600
00:42:34,363 --> 00:42:38,322
the couple comes in and they kneel down
in front of the whole congregation...

601
00:42:38,403 --> 00:42:40,473
and they just stare at each other.

602
00:42:41,163 --> 00:42:44,838
Nobody says a word unless they feel
that God moves them to speak...

603
00:42:45,123 --> 00:42:46,602
or say something.

604
00:42:47,603 --> 00:42:50,071
And then, after an hour or so of just...

605
00:42:51,643 --> 00:42:54,441
staring at each other they're married.

606
00:42:57,083 --> 00:42:58,960
That's beautiful. I like that.

607
00:43:15,043 --> 00:43:16,715
This is a horrible story.

608
00:43:17,563 --> 00:43:18,552
What?

609
00:43:19,003 --> 00:43:21,471
- It's not the appropriate place to tell it.
- What?

610
00:43:21,563 --> 00:43:24,282
Well, I was driving around
with this buddy of mine.

611
00:43:24,363 --> 00:43:26,240
He's a big atheist, you know.

612
00:43:26,603 --> 00:43:29,322
And he came to a stop
next to this homeless guy.

613
00:43:29,483 --> 00:43:31,519
My buddy takes out a $100 bill...

614
00:43:31,883 --> 00:43:33,362
and leans out the window...

615
00:43:33,443 --> 00:43:36,435
and he says, "Do you believe in God?"

616
00:43:37,363 --> 00:43:40,514
And the guy looks at my friend,
he looks at the money.

617
00:43:41,203 --> 00:43:42,522
He says:

618
00:43:43,323 --> 00:43:44,642
"Yes, I do."

619
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:48,195
My friend says, "Wrong answer."
We drove away.

620
00:43:49,443 --> 00:43:51,752
- That's mean.
- Yeah.

621
00:44:01,403 --> 00:44:05,282
Would you be in Paris by now
if you hadn't gotten off the train with me?

622
00:44:05,763 --> 00:44:07,162
No, not yet.

623
00:44:08,403 --> 00:44:09,756
What would you be doing?

624
00:44:09,843 --> 00:44:12,641
I'd be hanging around the airport,
reading magazines...

625
00:44:12,723 --> 00:44:15,681
crying in my coffee
because you didn't come with me.

626
00:44:19,803 --> 00:44:23,557
I'd probably gotten off the train
in Salzburg with someone else.

627
00:44:23,643 --> 00:44:25,793
Oh, yeah? Oh, I see.

628
00:44:25,883 --> 00:44:30,513
So I'm just a dumb American momentarily
decorating your blank canvas?

629
00:44:31,883 --> 00:44:33,362
I'm having a great time.

630
00:44:33,443 --> 00:44:34,592
- Really?
- Yeah.

631
00:44:35,083 --> 00:44:36,277
Me, too.

632
00:44:38,003 --> 00:44:40,119
I'm glad because no one knows I'm here...

633
00:44:40,203 --> 00:44:44,355
and I don't know anyone that would
tell me all those bad things you've done.

634
00:44:44,443 --> 00:44:46,593
- I'll tell you some.
- Yeah, I'm sure.

635
00:44:47,523 --> 00:44:50,162
You know, you hear
so much shit about people.

636
00:44:50,483 --> 00:44:54,078
I always feel like the general of an army
when I start dating a guy.

637
00:44:54,163 --> 00:44:56,233
Plotting my strategy and maneuverings...

638
00:44:56,323 --> 00:44:59,918
knowing his weak points,
what would hurt him, seduce him.

639
00:45:00,043 --> 00:45:01,522
It's horrible.

640
00:45:05,443 --> 00:45:07,434
If we were with each other always...

641
00:45:07,523 --> 00:45:10,720
what would be the first thing
about me that would drive you mad?

642
00:45:11,403 --> 00:45:13,917
No. I'm not going to answer this question.

643
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:17,962
I dated this girl once
who used to always ask me that.

644
00:45:18,043 --> 00:45:19,556
"What about me bugs you?"

645
00:45:19,643 --> 00:45:23,272
Finally, I said, "I don't think
you handle criticism too well."

646
00:45:23,443 --> 00:45:26,594
She flew into a rage
and broke up with me. That's a true story.

647
00:45:26,683 --> 00:45:27,957
All she ever wanted to do...

648
00:45:28,043 --> 00:45:31,194
was to have an excuse to tell me
what she thought was wrong with me.

649
00:45:31,683 --> 00:45:32,957
- Is that what you want?
- What?

650
00:45:33,043 --> 00:45:34,954
- Something about me bugs you?
- No.

651
00:45:35,043 --> 00:45:38,115
- What is it about me bugs you?
- Nothing at all.

652
00:45:38,203 --> 00:45:40,763
If it had to be something,
what would it be?

653
00:45:40,843 --> 00:45:44,358
If it had to be something,
if I had to think about it...

654
00:45:44,563 --> 00:45:48,078
I kind of didn't really like this reaction
at the palm reader.

655
00:45:48,163 --> 00:45:50,154
You were like this rooster prick.

656
00:45:50,483 --> 00:45:52,474
What the hell is a rooster prick?

657
00:45:52,563 --> 00:45:56,351
You were like a boy whining because
all the attention wasn't focused on him.

658
00:45:56,443 --> 00:45:59,480
All right, listen.
This woman robs you blind, okay?

659
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,517
You were like a boy
walking by an ice-cream store...

660
00:46:02,603 --> 00:46:05,197
crying because his mother
won't buy him a milkshake.

661
00:46:05,283 --> 00:46:07,717
I don't care what this charlatan
has to say about...

662
00:46:07,803 --> 00:46:08,792
Hello?

663
00:46:10,403 --> 00:46:11,518
What?

664
00:46:14,283 --> 00:46:17,593
I understand a little bit,
but he doesn't at all. I'm sorry.

665
00:46:17,963 --> 00:46:19,032
Okay.

666
00:46:20,443 --> 00:46:23,276
- May I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

667
00:46:24,723 --> 00:46:27,317
<i>I would like to make a deal with you.</i>

668
00:46:28,843 --> 00:46:32,802
I mean, instead of just asking you
for money, I will ask you for a word.

669
00:46:33,283 --> 00:46:35,592
You give me a word, I take the word...

670
00:46:35,683 --> 00:46:38,755
and then I will write a poem
with the word inside.

671
00:46:40,243 --> 00:46:42,803
And if you like it, if you like my poem...

672
00:46:43,003 --> 00:46:45,563
if you feel it adds something to your life
in any way...

673
00:46:45,643 --> 00:46:48,203
then you can pay me
whatever you feel like.

674
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:50,793
I'll write in English, of course.

675
00:46:51,963 --> 00:46:53,760
- Okay. Great.
- All right. Great.

676
00:46:56,043 --> 00:46:57,078
So?

677
00:46:59,083 --> 00:47:00,232
Pick a word.

678
00:47:02,083 --> 00:47:03,232
A word.

679
00:47:04,643 --> 00:47:07,032
- Milkshake.
- Milkshake? Good.

680
00:47:07,123 --> 00:47:09,921
I was gonna say "rooster prick."
But great. Milkshake.

681
00:47:10,003 --> 00:47:11,152
Milkshake?

682
00:47:12,043 --> 00:47:13,681
Okay, milkshake.

683
00:47:14,283 --> 00:47:15,875
<i>- All right, so...
- Good.</i>

684
00:47:26,803 --> 00:47:30,762
I gotta say,
I like this Viennese variation of bum.

685
00:47:30,843 --> 00:47:33,915
I like what he said
about adding something to your life.

686
00:47:34,243 --> 00:47:37,440
So, were we having our first fight
back there?

687
00:47:38,003 --> 00:47:40,915
- No.
- I think so. I think we were.

688
00:47:41,243 --> 00:47:45,077
Even if we were, why does everyone think
conflict is so bad?

689
00:47:45,163 --> 00:47:47,916
There's a lot of good things
coming out of conflict.

690
00:47:48,003 --> 00:47:49,516
Yeah, I guess so.

691
00:47:50,923 --> 00:47:53,312
I always think
if I could just accept the fact...

692
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:57,078
that my life was supposed to be difficult,
that's what's to be expected...

693
00:47:57,163 --> 00:47:59,199
then I might not get so pissed off about it.

694
00:47:59,283 --> 00:48:01,877
And I'd just be glad
when something nice happens.

695
00:48:02,043 --> 00:48:03,840
Maybe that's why I'm still in school.

696
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:06,312
It's easier to have something
to fight against.

697
00:48:07,163 --> 00:48:10,121
We've all had such competitiveness
ingrained in us.

698
00:48:10,283 --> 00:48:12,319
I can be doing the most nothing thing.

699
00:48:12,403 --> 00:48:15,759
I can be throwing some darts
or shooting some pool.

700
00:48:15,963 --> 00:48:18,523
Then all of a sudden,
I feel it come over me.

701
00:48:18,683 --> 00:48:20,355
I have got to win.

702
00:48:21,203 --> 00:48:24,639
Is that why you tried to get me
off the train? Competitiveness?

703
00:48:24,763 --> 00:48:26,401
- What do you mean?
- Okay.

704
00:48:27,883 --> 00:48:30,272
- I got you a poem.
- All right.

705
00:48:32,483 --> 00:48:34,121
Will you read it to us?

706
00:48:37,523 --> 00:48:38,717
Sure. Okay.

707
00:48:42,883 --> 00:48:44,555
"Daydream delusion

708
00:48:45,163 --> 00:48:46,801
"Limousine eyelash

709
00:48:47,923 --> 00:48:50,198

"Drop a tear in my wineglass

711
00:48:53,203 --> 00:48:54,841
"Look at those big eyes

00:48:55,483 --> 00:48:57,439
"See what you mean to me

713
00:48:57,803 --> 00:49:00,033
"Sweet cakes and milkshakes

714
00:49:00,723 --> 00:49:02,554
"I am a delusion angel

715
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:05,320
"I'm a fantasy parade

716
00:49:05,923 --> 00:49:09,802
"I want you to know what I think
Don't want you to guess anymore

00:49:09,923 --> 00:49:12,039

"Don't you know me?

724
00:49:30,523 --> 00:49:32,275
"Don't you know me by now?"

725
00:49:33,323 --> 00:49:34,472
Great.

726
00:49:35,323 --> 00:49:37,120
- Thanks.
- Thanks, man.

727
00:49:40,723 --> 00:49:42,156
Here you go.

728
00:49:43,843 --> 00:49:45,435
- Thanks.
- All right.

729
00:49:45,523 --> 00:49:47,434
<i>- Here. Thank you.
- Thank you.</i>

730
00:49:47,923 --> 00:49:49,072
Good luck.

731
00:49:49,163 --> 00:49:50,516
- Bye.
- Bye.

732
00:50:04,403 --> 00:50:06,473
- It was wonderful, no?
- Yeah.

733
00:50:10,483 --> 00:50:13,043
- What?
- He probably didn't just write that.

734
00:50:13,123 --> 00:50:15,956
He wrote it,
but he probably plugs that word in.

735
00:50:16,043 --> 00:50:18,113
You know, whatever, "milkshake."

736
00:50:18,363 --> 00:50:21,799
- What do you mean?
- Nothing. I loved it. It was great.

737
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,161
- You know what drives me crazy?
- What?

738
00:50:31,243 --> 00:50:35,031
People always talk about how great
technology is, how it saves all this time.

739
00:50:35,123 --> 00:50:38,081
But what good is saved time
if nobody uses it?

740
00:50:38,163 --> 00:50:40,518
- It just turns into more busy work.
- Yeah.

741
00:50:40,603 --> 00:50:45,040
You never hear anyone say, "With the time
I've saved by using my word processor...

742
00:50:45,123 --> 00:50:47,842
"I'm gonna go to a Zen monastery
and hang out."

743
00:50:48,163 --> 00:50:50,961
- You don't hear that.
- Time is abstract anyway.

744
00:50:51,243 --> 00:50:53,473
- Were you looking at this girl?
- What?

745
00:50:53,763 --> 00:50:55,116
Nothing.

746
00:50:55,763 --> 00:50:57,355
- You wanna go in here?
- What?

747
00:50:57,443 --> 00:51:00,480
- You wanna go in here?
- Yeah. It's a club, no?

748
00:51:02,563 --> 00:51:04,519
Wanna go? Hello.

749
00:51:06,803 --> 00:51:08,122
Fifty schillings.

750
00:51:08,723 --> 00:51:11,317
- Each.
- I got a 100. Here, I got it.

751
00:51:12,323 --> 00:51:14,279
<i>I'll buy you a beer. Thank you.</i>

752
00:52:00,163 --> 00:52:01,960
- You gonna buy me a beer?
- Yeah.

753
00:52:06,283 --> 00:52:08,717
You think Old Milwaukee
is expensive here?

754
00:52:35,523 --> 00:52:39,402
We haven't talked about this yet,
but are you dating anyone?

755
00:52:39,483 --> 00:52:43,795
You got a boyfriend waiting on you
back in Paris or anything like that?

756
00:52:43,883 --> 00:52:46,238
- No, not right now.
- But you did.

757
00:52:47,883 --> 00:52:50,238
- We broke up six months ago.
- Six months ago?

758
00:52:50,323 --> 00:52:51,802
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

759
00:52:52,283 --> 00:52:55,036
I mean, I'm not that sorry.
But tell me about it.

760
00:52:55,123 --> 00:52:58,832
No, no way. I can't. It's really boring.

761
00:52:58,923 --> 00:53:00,914
Come on. Tell me about it.

762
00:53:01,683 --> 00:53:04,402
Okay. I was really disappointed.

763
00:53:04,603 --> 00:53:06,275
I thought this one would last a while.

764
00:53:06,403 --> 00:53:11,397
<i>I mean, he was very stupid,
ugly, bad in bed, alcoholic...</i>

765
00:53:12,683 --> 00:53:14,355
- You know.
- A real prize winner.

766
00:53:16,123 --> 00:53:18,159
I was kind of giving him a favor.

767
00:53:18,323 --> 00:53:21,156
But he left me,
saying I loved him too much.

768
00:53:21,243 --> 00:53:25,122
I was blocking his artistic expression
or some shit like that.

769
00:53:26,283 --> 00:53:28,558
But anyway, I was traumatized...

770
00:53:29,483 --> 00:53:31,474
and became totally obsessed with him.

771
00:53:32,163 --> 00:53:33,391
So I went to a shrink...

772
00:53:33,483 --> 00:53:36,600
and it came up that I had written
this little stupid story...

773
00:53:36,683 --> 00:53:39,402
about this woman
trying to kill her boyfriend...

774
00:53:40,523 --> 00:53:43,515
and how she was gonna do it
with all the intricate details...

775
00:53:43,723 --> 00:53:47,193
- of how to do it and not get caught...
- She was gonna kill her boyfriend?

776
00:53:48,883 --> 00:53:50,441
Yeah, she was.

777
00:53:51,243 --> 00:53:53,837
It's nothing I would do,
but it was just some writing.

778
00:53:53,923 --> 00:53:54,912
No, I understand.

779
00:53:55,003 --> 00:53:57,836
But anyway this stupid shrink believed
everything I told her.

780
00:53:57,923 --> 00:54:01,518
It was my first time seeing her.
She said she had to call the police.

781
00:54:01,603 --> 00:54:03,195
- She had to call the police?
- Yes.

782
00:54:03,283 --> 00:54:04,716
<i>She was... Merde!</i>

783
00:54:04,883 --> 00:54:07,397
She was totally convinced
I was really gonna do it.

784
00:54:07,963 --> 00:54:10,761
Even though I had explained
it was just some writing.

785
00:54:10,843 --> 00:54:12,799
She said, looking deep into my eyes:

786
00:54:12,883 --> 00:54:15,397
"The way you said it
I know you are going to do it.

787
00:54:15,483 --> 00:54:18,520
"The way you said it."
She was totally out of her mind.

788
00:54:19,203 --> 00:54:22,832
- It was my first and last session.
- So what happened then?

789
00:54:25,363 --> 00:54:27,194
I totally got over him.

790
00:54:27,443 --> 00:54:29,081
But now I'm obsessed...

791
00:54:29,243 --> 00:54:33,122
that he's gonna die from an accident
or 1000 kilometers away.

792
00:54:33,363 --> 00:54:35,479
And I'm gonna be the one accused.

793
00:54:38,323 --> 00:54:42,157
Why is it you become obsessed
with people you don't like that much?

794
00:54:42,243 --> 00:54:44,598
- You know what I mean?
- I don't know.

795
00:54:46,603 --> 00:54:47,956
So how about you?

796
00:54:49,443 --> 00:54:51,479
- What?
- Are you with anyone?

797
00:54:53,483 --> 00:54:56,919
It's funny how we managed to avoid
this subject for so long, isn't it?

798
00:54:57,283 --> 00:54:59,001
But now you have to tell me.

799
00:54:59,203 --> 00:55:01,353
Well, I kind of see love...

800
00:55:01,443 --> 00:55:04,958
as this escape for two people
who don't know how to be alone.

801
00:55:06,643 --> 00:55:09,794
I mean, it's funny.
People always talk about how...

802
00:55:09,883 --> 00:55:12,716
Iove is this totally unselfish, giving thing.

803
00:55:12,803 --> 00:55:15,875
But if you think about it,
there's nothing more selfish.

804
00:55:16,643 --> 00:55:17,837
I know.

805
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:20,593
So, who just broke up with you?

806
00:55:22,323 --> 00:55:23,438
What?

807
00:55:25,683 --> 00:55:27,753
You sound like you've just been hurt.

808
00:55:28,123 --> 00:55:29,556
- Do I?
- Yeah.

809
00:55:29,643 --> 00:55:30,837
All right.

810
00:55:31,963 --> 00:55:33,476
Big confession.

811
00:55:33,563 --> 00:55:36,202
I should've told you this earlier
or something.

812
00:55:37,483 --> 00:55:40,555
I didn't come to Europe just to hang out...

813
00:55:40,643 --> 00:55:43,555
and read Hemingway in Paris
and shit like that.

814
00:55:43,803 --> 00:55:47,034
I saved up my money all spring
to fly to Madrid...

815
00:55:47,123 --> 00:55:49,842
and spend the summer with my girlfriend
who's been on...

816
00:55:49,923 --> 00:55:51,675
- Your girlfriend?
- My ex-girlfriend...

817
00:55:51,763 --> 00:55:55,039
who has been on this asinine
art history program for the last year.

818
00:55:55,123 --> 00:55:58,559
Anyway, I got here.
We were reunited at long last...

819
00:55:58,643 --> 00:56:02,192
and we went out to dinner, our first night,
with six of her friends.

820
00:56:02,763 --> 00:56:07,393
Pedro, Antonio, Gonzalo,
Maria, Suzy from home.

821
00:56:07,643 --> 00:56:11,397
She avoided being alone with me for
the first couple of days we were there...

822
00:56:11,483 --> 00:56:15,840
and I stuck around for a while just to let it
sink in that she wished I hadn't come.

823
00:56:17,243 --> 00:56:21,077
So I bought the cheapest flight out,
this one leaving out of Vienna tomorrow...

824
00:56:21,163 --> 00:56:24,917
but it didn't leave for a couple weeks,
so I bought this Eurail pass.

825
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:29,876
You know what's the worst thing
about somebody breaking up with you?

826
00:56:30,803 --> 00:56:33,363
It's when you remember
how little you thought...

827
00:56:33,443 --> 00:56:35,274
about the people you broke up with...

828
00:56:35,363 --> 00:56:39,481
<i>and you realize that that is how little
they're thinking about you.</i>

829
00:56:40,163 --> 00:56:42,597
You'd like to think
you're both in all this pain...

830
00:56:42,683 --> 00:56:45,675
but really, they're just,
"Hey, I'm glad you're gone."

831
00:56:45,763 --> 00:56:47,435
Believe me, I know.

832
00:56:48,243 --> 00:56:50,996
- You should look at bright colors.
- What?

833
00:56:51,803 --> 00:56:53,714
That's what the shrink told me.

834
00:56:53,803 --> 00:56:58,558
I was paying her 900 francs an hour
to hear that I was a homicidal maniac...

835
00:56:58,763 --> 00:57:02,642
but I could shift my obsession
if I would concentrate on bright colors.

836
00:57:02,723 --> 00:57:03,872
Did it work?

837
00:57:07,563 --> 00:57:09,713
- Didn't help your pinball.
- Well, no.

838
00:57:10,163 --> 00:57:13,792
Yeah, well, you know,
I haven't killed anyone lately.

839
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:17,080
Not lately? That's good. You're cured then.

840
00:57:23,563 --> 00:57:26,873
There's these breeds of monkeys,
and all they do is have sex...

841
00:57:26,963 --> 00:57:28,521
all the time, you know?

842
00:57:28,603 --> 00:57:33,074
They turn out to be the least violent,
the most peaceful, the most happy.

843
00:57:33,163 --> 00:57:36,200
So maybe fooling around is not so bad.

844
00:57:36,523 --> 00:57:39,515
- Are you talking about monkeys?
- Yes, I'm talking about monkeys.

845
00:57:40,003 --> 00:57:41,197
- I thought so.
- Why?

846
00:57:41,283 --> 00:57:42,762
I never heard this one.

847
00:57:42,843 --> 00:57:45,721
But it reminds me
of this perfect male argument...

848
00:57:45,803 --> 00:57:47,441
to justify them fooling around.

849
00:57:47,523 --> 00:57:51,038
Women monkeys are fooling around, too.
Everybody's fooling around.

850
00:57:51,603 --> 00:57:55,482
Yeah, that's cute.
I have this awful, paranoid thought...

851
00:57:55,563 --> 00:57:58,635
that feminism
was mostly invented by men...

852
00:57:58,723 --> 00:58:00,793
so they could fool around a little more.

853
00:58:00,883 --> 00:58:03,955
"Woman, free your mind,
free your body. Sleep with me.

854
00:58:04,043 --> 00:58:07,672
"We're all happy and free,
as long as I can fuck as much as I can."

855
00:58:09,243 --> 00:58:12,952
All right. But maybe there's
some biological things at work here.

856
00:58:13,723 --> 00:58:15,315
If you had an island...

857
00:58:15,403 --> 00:58:19,760
and there were 99 women on the island
and only one man...

858
00:58:20,003 --> 00:58:22,597
in a year,
you'd have the possibility of 99 babies.

859
00:58:22,683 --> 00:58:26,198
But if you have an island
with 99 men and only one woman...

860
00:58:26,283 --> 00:58:29,036
in a year,
you have the possibility of only one baby.

861
00:58:29,123 --> 00:58:30,556
<i>So...</i>

862
00:58:31,003 --> 00:58:32,038
You know what?

863
00:58:32,123 --> 00:58:35,877
On this island, I think there will be
only maybe 43 men left.

864
00:58:36,203 --> 00:58:39,639
They would've killed each other
trying to fuck this poor woman.

865
00:58:40,003 --> 00:58:41,231
On the other island...

866
00:58:41,323 --> 00:58:45,362
there would be 99 women, 99 babies,
and no more man.

867
00:58:46,203 --> 00:58:48,876
Because they would've gotten together
and eaten him alive.

868
00:58:48,963 --> 00:58:50,442
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

869
00:58:50,603 --> 00:58:52,321
There's something to that.

870
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:56,191
On some level, women don't mind the idea
of destroying a man.

871
00:58:57,323 --> 00:59:00,156
I was once walking down the street
with my ex-girlfriend...

872
00:59:00,243 --> 00:59:04,316
and we'd just walked by these four
thuggy-Iooking guys next to a Camaro.

873
00:59:05,043 --> 00:59:08,080
And one of them says,
"Hey, baby, nice ass!"

874
00:59:08,163 --> 00:59:11,519
So I'm like, "No big deal.
I won't get uptight about this."

875
00:59:11,883 --> 00:59:14,681
- Plus, there were four of them.
- Exactly.

876
00:59:14,763 --> 00:59:16,640
She turns and says,
"Fuck you, dickheads!"

877
00:59:16,723 --> 00:59:19,840
And I'm like, "Okay. Wait a minute here."

878
00:59:19,923 --> 00:59:22,517
They're not gonna come over
and kick her ass.

879
00:59:22,603 --> 00:59:25,401
So who just got pushed to the frontline
on that one?

880
00:59:25,483 --> 00:59:28,555
Women say they hate it
if you're all territorial and protective...

881
00:59:28,643 --> 00:59:32,921
<i>but if it suits them, then they'll tell you
you're being all unmanly, or wimpy, or...</i>

882
00:59:33,003 --> 00:59:36,473
You know what? I don't think
women really want to destroy men.

883
00:59:37,803 --> 00:59:40,192
Even if they want to, they don't succeed.

884
00:59:40,403 --> 00:59:42,439
I'm sure even men
are destroying women...

885
00:59:42,523 --> 00:59:45,595
or are able or capable of destroying
women, much more than women.

886
00:59:45,683 --> 00:59:48,072
Anyway, it's depressing.
I mean, you know what?

887
00:59:48,163 --> 00:59:50,518
- You wanna stop talking about this?
- I hate it.

888
00:59:50,603 --> 00:59:53,481
<i>Men, women, it's... There's no end to this.</i>

889
00:59:55,363 --> 00:59:57,081
- It's like a skipping record.
- Yeah.

890
00:59:57,163 --> 01:00:00,075
Every couple's been
having this conversation forever.

891
01:00:00,323 --> 01:00:02,439
And nobody came up with anything.

892
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:20,791
I saw a documentary on that.
It's a birth dance.

893
01:00:20,883 --> 01:00:22,555
- A birth dance?
- Yeah.

894
01:00:49,523 --> 01:00:51,320
Should I give her some money?

895
01:00:51,403 --> 01:00:54,156
Everything that's interesting
costs a little bit of money.

896
01:00:56,323 --> 01:00:57,915
So, a birth dance?

897
01:00:58,083 --> 01:01:00,677
Looked a little bit
like a mating dance to me.

898
01:01:00,843 --> 01:01:03,596
No, but really.
Women used it when giving birth.

899
01:01:03,803 --> 01:01:06,078
In some part of the world, they still do it.

900
01:01:07,323 --> 01:01:09,791
The woman in labor enters a tent...

901
01:01:09,883 --> 01:01:12,351
and the women of her tribe
surround her and dance.

902
01:01:12,443 --> 01:01:15,003
They encourage the birthing woman
to dance with them...

903
01:01:15,083 --> 01:01:17,153
so as to make the birth less painful.

904
01:01:17,283 --> 01:01:20,275
And when the baby is born,
they all dance in celebration.

905
01:01:21,683 --> 01:01:24,243
I don't think my mom
would've gone for that.

906
01:01:24,363 --> 01:01:26,718
I like the idea of dancing
as a common function.

907
01:01:26,803 --> 01:01:29,363
- Something everybody participates in.
- I know.

908
01:01:29,523 --> 01:01:33,675
I heard about this old guy who was
watching some young people dance.

909
01:01:34,083 --> 01:01:35,436
He said, "How beautiful.

910
01:01:35,523 --> 01:01:38,515
"They're trying to shake off their genitals,
and become angels."

911
01:01:38,603 --> 01:01:40,958
- I like that.
- One question, though, back there.

912
01:01:41,043 --> 01:01:44,399
When the women are dancing
and being all spiritual and stuff...

913
01:01:44,483 --> 01:01:45,882
where are the men?

914
01:01:45,963 --> 01:01:49,717
Are we out food gathering?
Are we not invited? You all don't need us?

915
01:01:49,963 --> 01:01:52,636
Men are lucky
we don't bite off their heads after mating.

916
01:01:52,723 --> 01:01:55,442
Certain insects do that,
like spiders and stuff?

917
01:01:55,723 --> 01:01:58,237
We let you live.
What are you complaining about?

918
01:01:58,323 --> 01:02:01,713
See, you're officially kidding.
But there's something to that.

919
01:02:01,923 --> 01:02:03,959
- You keep bringing stuff like that up.
- What?

920
01:02:04,043 --> 01:02:06,159
- Yeah.
- No, wait a minute.

921
01:02:06,483 --> 01:02:07,962
Talking seriously here...

922
01:02:09,043 --> 01:02:13,594
I feel this pressure of being a strong
and independent icon of womanhood...

923
01:02:13,723 --> 01:02:18,274
and not making it look like my whole life
is revolving around some guy.

924
01:02:18,843 --> 01:02:21,311
But loving someone...

925
01:02:21,843 --> 01:02:24,403
and being loved means so much to me.

926
01:02:25,683 --> 01:02:28,197
I always make fun of it and stuff...

927
01:02:28,883 --> 01:02:33,195
but isn't everything we do in life
a way to be loved a little more?

928
01:02:37,803 --> 01:02:39,156
I don't know.

929
01:02:39,523 --> 01:02:41,673
Sometimes I dream...

930
01:02:41,763 --> 01:02:44,516
about being a good father
and a good husband.

931
01:02:44,603 --> 01:02:46,639
And sometimes it feels really close.

932
01:02:47,803 --> 01:02:49,680
But then other times...

933
01:02:50,643 --> 01:02:52,474
it seems silly...

934
01:02:52,803 --> 01:02:56,239
like it would ruin my whole life.

935
01:02:57,003 --> 01:02:59,597
And it's not just a fear of commitment...

936
01:02:59,683 --> 01:03:03,995
or that I'm incapable of caring or loving
because I can.

937
01:03:05,483 --> 01:03:08,793
It's just that,
if I'm totally honest with myself...

938
01:03:09,683 --> 01:03:13,801
I think I'd rather die knowing
that I was really good at something.

939
01:03:14,043 --> 01:03:16,432
That I had excelled in some way...

940
01:03:17,003 --> 01:03:21,394
than that I had just been
in a nice, caring relationship.

941
01:03:28,163 --> 01:03:31,200
I had worked for this older man,
and once he told me...

942
01:03:31,603 --> 01:03:35,278
that he had spent all of his life
thinking about his career and his work.

943
01:03:35,363 --> 01:03:37,672
He was 52, and it suddenly struck him...

944
01:03:38,163 --> 01:03:41,041
that he had never really
given anything of himself.

945
01:03:41,563 --> 01:03:44,077
His life was for no one and nothing.

946
01:03:45,163 --> 01:03:47,552
He was almost crying saying that.

947
01:03:50,283 --> 01:03:52,843
You know, I believe
if there's any kind of God...

948
01:03:52,923 --> 01:03:56,279
it wouldn't be in any of us,
not you or me...

949
01:03:57,563 --> 01:03:59,793
but just this little space in between.

950
01:04:02,963 --> 01:04:05,523
If there's any kind of magic in this world...

951
01:04:05,643 --> 01:04:09,921
it must be in the attempt of understanding
someone, sharing something.

952
01:04:12,003 --> 01:04:14,881
I know it's almost impossible to succeed...

953
01:04:16,043 --> 01:04:17,874
but who cares, really?

954
01:04:18,723 --> 01:04:20,953
The answer must be in the attempt.

955
01:05:26,683 --> 01:05:30,358
I really think this is a civilization
in decline. Look at the service.

956
01:05:30,443 --> 01:05:32,081
- The service?
- Where is the waitress?

957
01:05:32,163 --> 01:05:33,960
In New York, she'd be out of a job.

958
01:05:42,403 --> 01:05:44,200
I'm gonna call my best friend in Paris...

959
01:05:44,283 --> 01:05:47,434
who I'm supposed to have lunch with
in eight hours, okay?

960
01:05:55,643 --> 01:05:57,042
- Pick up.
- What?

961
01:05:57,123 --> 01:05:59,114
- Pick up the phone.
- Hello?

962
01:06:11,243 --> 01:06:15,475
I've been working on my English recently.
You wanna talk in English, for laughs?

963
01:06:15,563 --> 01:06:17,360
Yeah, okay. That's a good idea.

964
01:06:19,563 --> 01:06:22,873
I don't think I'll be able to make it
for lunch today. I'm sorry.

965
01:06:24,483 --> 01:06:28,237
I met a guy on the train, and I got off
with him in Vienna. We're still there.

966
01:06:28,323 --> 01:06:30,154
Are you crazy?

967
01:06:31,163 --> 01:06:32,437
Probably.

968
01:06:33,323 --> 01:06:35,837
- He's Austrian? He's from there?
- No.

969
01:06:36,003 --> 01:06:39,712
He's passing through. He's American.
He's going back home tomorrow morning.

970
01:06:39,803 --> 01:06:42,033
Why did you get off the train with him?

971
01:06:42,283 --> 01:06:44,114
Well, he convinced me.

972
01:06:45,563 --> 01:06:49,272
I mean, actually, I was ready
to get off the train with him...

973
01:06:49,443 --> 01:06:53,197
after talking to him a short while.
He was so sweet, I couldn't help it.

974
01:06:54,723 --> 01:06:57,601
We were in the lounge car
and he began to talk about him...

975
01:06:57,683 --> 01:07:00,641
as a little boy
seeing his great-grandmother's ghost.

976
01:07:01,523 --> 01:07:03,798
I think that's when I fell for him.

977
01:07:04,763 --> 01:07:08,551
Just the idea of this little boy
with all those beautiful dreams.

978
01:07:09,803 --> 01:07:10,997
He trapped me.

979
01:07:14,523 --> 01:07:17,833
And he's so cute.
He has beautiful blue eyes...

980
01:07:18,563 --> 01:07:20,076
nice pink lips...

981
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:22,716
greasy hair.

982
01:07:23,243 --> 01:07:24,562
I love it.

983
01:07:25,363 --> 01:07:28,082
He's kind of tall, and he's a little clumsy.

984
01:07:29,723 --> 01:07:32,362
I like to feel his eyes on me
when I look away.

985
01:07:36,563 --> 01:07:39,635
He kind of kisses like an adolescent.
It's so cute.

986
01:07:39,723 --> 01:07:41,634
- What?
- Yeah, we kissed.

987
01:07:41,963 --> 01:07:43,316
It was so adorable.

988
01:07:44,003 --> 01:07:47,518
As the night went on,
I began to like him more and more.

989
01:07:48,683 --> 01:07:50,321
But I'm afraid he's scared of me.

990
01:07:50,403 --> 01:07:54,442
I told him the story about the woman
that kills her ex-boyfriend and stuff.

991
01:07:54,883 --> 01:07:56,362
He must be scared to death.

992
01:07:56,443 --> 01:07:59,515
He must be thinking
I'm this manipulative, mean woman.

993
01:08:01,723 --> 01:08:04,283
I just hope
he doesn't feel that way about me.

994
01:08:04,363 --> 01:08:07,321
Because, you know me,
I'm the most harmless person.

995
01:08:08,643 --> 01:08:11,237
The only person
I could really hurt is myself.

996
01:08:12,283 --> 01:08:15,798
<i>I don't think he's scared of you.
I think he's crazy about you.</i>

997
01:08:16,683 --> 01:08:18,799
- Really?
- I've known you a long time.

998
01:08:18,883 --> 01:08:21,477
I got a good feeling.
You gonna see him again?

999
01:08:23,883 --> 01:08:25,953
We haven't talked about that yet.

1000
01:08:30,643 --> 01:08:32,713
Okay, it's your turn. You call your friend.

1001
01:08:32,803 --> 01:08:34,521
- Okay?
- All right.

1002
01:08:38,563 --> 01:08:40,793
I usually get
this guy's answering machine.

1003
01:08:43,643 --> 01:08:45,201
Hi, dude. What's up?

1004
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:49,762
Hey, Frank. How you been?
I'm glad you're home.

1005
01:08:49,843 --> 01:08:52,755
Cool. Yeah. So, how was Madrid?

1006
01:08:53,683 --> 01:08:55,196
Madrid sucked.

1007
01:08:56,323 --> 01:08:58,996
Lisa and I had our long overdue meltdown.

1008
01:08:59,323 --> 01:09:01,393
Too bad. I told you, no?

1009
01:09:01,483 --> 01:09:04,361
Yeah. The long-distance thing
just never works.

1010
01:09:04,643 --> 01:09:08,921
I was only in Madrid for a couple days.
I got a cheaper flight out of Vienna.

1011
01:09:11,203 --> 01:09:14,320
<i>You know,
it really wasn't that much cheaper. I just...</i>

1012
01:09:14,563 --> 01:09:18,397
I couldn't go home right away.
I didn't want to see anybody I knew.

1013
01:09:18,483 --> 01:09:21,555
I just wanted to be a ghost,
completely anonymous.

1014
01:09:23,083 --> 01:09:24,516
- So are you okay now?
- Yeah.

1015
01:09:24,603 --> 01:09:26,912
I'm great. That's the thing.

1016
01:09:28,003 --> 01:09:30,597
I'm rapturous. And I'll tell you why.

1017
01:09:31,203 --> 01:09:34,161
I met somebody on my last night
in Europe. Can you believe it?

1018
01:09:34,243 --> 01:09:36,757
- That's incredible.
- I know.

1019
01:09:36,843 --> 01:09:40,279
You know how they say
we're all each other's demons and angels?

1020
01:09:41,203 --> 01:09:43,956
Well, she was literally a Botticelli angel...

1021
01:09:44,083 --> 01:09:47,280
just telling me
that everything was gonna be okay.

1022
01:09:50,123 --> 01:09:51,476
How did you meet?

1023
01:09:52,683 --> 01:09:53,877
On the train.

1024
01:09:54,563 --> 01:09:58,875
She was sitting next to this weird couple
that started fighting, so she had to move.

1025
01:09:58,963 --> 01:10:02,592
She sat right across the aisle from me.
So we started to talk.

1026
01:10:03,803 --> 01:10:07,079
She didn't like me much at first.
She's super smart...

1027
01:10:07,163 --> 01:10:08,994
very passionate...

1028
01:10:09,843 --> 01:10:10,992
and beautiful.

1029
01:10:12,443 --> 01:10:14,673
And I was so unsure of myself.

1030
01:10:15,163 --> 01:10:18,155
I thought everything I said
sounded so stupid.

1031
01:10:19,323 --> 01:10:23,032
- Man, I wouldn't worry about that.
- No.

1032
01:10:23,123 --> 01:10:25,353
<i>No, I'm sure she was not judging you.</i>

1033
01:10:25,723 --> 01:10:29,636
<i>No, and by the way, she sat next to you.
I'm sure she did it on purpose.</i>

1034
01:10:30,003 --> 01:10:31,322
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1035
01:10:34,843 --> 01:10:38,756
Us men are so stupid. We don't
understand anything about women.

1036
01:10:39,763 --> 01:10:42,323
They act strange, the little I know of them.

1037
01:10:42,723 --> 01:10:43,872
Don't they?

1038
01:10:45,523 --> 01:10:46,638
Yeah.

1039
01:10:50,723 --> 01:10:54,318
I feel like
this is some dream world we're in.

1040
01:10:54,603 --> 01:10:56,321
Yeah, it's so weird.

1041
01:10:56,603 --> 01:11:00,232
It's like our time together is just ours.
It's our own creation.

1042
01:11:01,283 --> 01:11:04,514
It must be like I'm in your dream
and you're in mine or something.

1043
01:11:06,083 --> 01:11:09,598
What's so cool is that this whole evening,
all our time together...

1044
01:11:09,683 --> 01:11:11,958
shouldn't officially be happening.

1045
01:11:12,043 --> 01:11:15,592
Yeah, I know. Maybe that's why
this feels so otherworldly.

1046
01:11:17,363 --> 01:11:20,673
But then the morning comes
and we turn into pumpkins, right?

1047
01:11:21,483 --> 01:11:22,632
I know.

1048
01:11:23,723 --> 01:11:26,715
But now, you're supposed
to produce the glass slipper...

1049
01:11:26,803 --> 01:11:28,316
and see if it fits.

1050
01:11:31,443 --> 01:11:32,671
It'll fit.

1051
01:11:50,363 --> 01:11:52,160
This friend of mine had a kid...

1052
01:11:52,243 --> 01:11:55,280
and it was a home birth,
so he was there helping out.

1053
01:11:55,443 --> 01:11:58,196
But he said
at that profound moment of birth...

1054
01:11:59,683 --> 01:12:02,880
he was watching his child experiencing life
for the first time...

1055
01:12:03,483 --> 01:12:05,439
trying to take its first breath.

1056
01:12:05,523 --> 01:12:09,038
All he could think about was
that he was looking at something...

1057
01:12:09,123 --> 01:12:11,079
that was gonna die someday.

1058
01:12:11,403 --> 01:12:13,871
He just couldn't get it out of his head.

1059
01:12:14,083 --> 01:12:17,837
And I think that's so true.
Everything is so finite.

1060
01:12:17,923 --> 01:12:21,393
But don't you think that's
what makes our time...

1061
01:12:21,483 --> 01:12:23,713
and specific moments so important?

1062
01:12:24,163 --> 01:12:27,280
Yeah, I know.
It's the same for us tonight, though.

1063
01:12:30,163 --> 01:12:33,997
After tomorrow, we're probably
never gonna see each other again, right?

1064
01:12:35,563 --> 01:12:38,031
You don't think
we'll ever see each other again?

1065
01:12:40,163 --> 01:12:41,562
What do you think?

1066
01:12:47,563 --> 01:12:49,474
Actually, I don't know.

1067
01:12:49,963 --> 01:12:52,523
- I hadn't planned another trip...
- Me, too.

1068
01:12:52,683 --> 01:12:55,243
I live in Paris, you live in the U.S.
I understand.

1069
01:12:55,323 --> 01:12:57,917
I'd hate to make you fly.
You hate to fly, right?

1070
01:12:58,003 --> 01:13:00,153
I'm not so scared of flying.

1071
01:13:00,843 --> 01:13:01,958
I mean, I could.

1072
01:13:02,043 --> 01:13:04,682
Well, if you were gonna come to the U. S...

1073
01:13:04,763 --> 01:13:06,879
<i>or if, you know, if I...</i>

1074
01:13:07,123 --> 01:13:09,717
Or, you know, I could come back here.

1075
01:13:10,483 --> 01:13:11,472
What?

1076
01:13:12,443 --> 01:13:15,082
No, let's just be rational adults about this.

1077
01:13:18,323 --> 01:13:20,120
Maybe we should try something different.

1078
01:13:20,203 --> 01:13:23,115
It's not so bad
if tonight is our only night, right?

1079
01:13:24,523 --> 01:13:26,514
People exchange numbers, addresses.

1080
01:13:26,603 --> 01:13:29,401
They end up writing once,
calling each other once or twice.

1081
01:13:29,483 --> 01:13:31,201
Right. Fizzles out.

1082
01:13:31,363 --> 01:13:33,752
Yeah, I don't want that. I hate that.

1083
01:13:34,803 --> 01:13:36,316
I hate that, too.

1084
01:13:36,803 --> 01:13:40,239
Why does everybody think
relationships should last forever, anyway?

1085
01:13:40,323 --> 01:13:42,234
Yeah, why? It's stupid.

1086
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:46,073
But you think tonight's it?

1087
01:13:46,803 --> 01:13:49,761
I mean, that tonight's our only night?

1088
01:13:52,083 --> 01:13:53,914
It's the only way, no?

1089
01:13:57,043 --> 01:13:58,442
Well, all right.

1090
01:13:59,803 --> 01:14:01,202
Let's do it.

1091
01:14:01,323 --> 01:14:03,200
No delusions, no projections.

1092
01:14:04,883 --> 01:14:06,874
We'll just make tonight great.

1093
01:14:09,363 --> 01:14:11,479
- Okay, let's do that.
- Okay.

1094
01:14:27,363 --> 01:14:29,513
We should do some kind of handshake.

1095
01:14:29,963 --> 01:14:31,362
Give me your hand.

1096
01:14:34,523 --> 01:14:38,960
To our one and only night together...

1097
01:14:40,163 --> 01:14:42,199
and the hours that remain.

1098
01:14:50,923 --> 01:14:52,038
What?

1099
01:14:54,563 --> 01:14:57,396
<i>It's just... It's depressing, no?</i>

1100
01:14:58,923 --> 01:15:01,596
Now the only thing
we're gonna think of is...

1101
01:15:01,683 --> 01:15:03,992
when we'll have
to say goodbye tomorrow.

1102
01:15:04,403 --> 01:15:07,554
We could say goodbye now.
Then we won't have to worry about it.

1103
01:15:07,643 --> 01:15:08,792
- Now?
- Yeah.

1104
01:15:09,483 --> 01:15:10,711
Say goodbye.

1105
01:15:10,803 --> 01:15:12,156
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

1106
01:15:13,803 --> 01:15:14,838
<i>Au revoir.</i>

1107
01:15:14,923 --> 01:15:16,879
- Later.
- Later, yeah.

1108
01:15:45,683 --> 01:15:46,911
Here's the plan.

1109
01:15:47,003 --> 01:15:49,836
You're gonna grab the glasses,
and I'm gonna get the wine.

1110
01:15:50,483 --> 01:15:52,235
- Red wine.
- Red wine. Right.

1111
01:15:52,323 --> 01:15:55,121
- You think you can do that?
- No problem.

1112
01:15:59,923 --> 01:16:01,720
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

1113
01:16:04,003 --> 01:16:05,152
Hello.

1114
01:16:09,443 --> 01:16:11,479
- Do you speak English?
- A bit.

1115
01:16:11,563 --> 01:16:13,554
Yeah? A bit? Well, all right.

1116
01:16:13,643 --> 01:16:16,999
<i>I'm having kind of an odd situation
which is that...</i>

1117
01:16:18,483 --> 01:16:20,360
You see that girl over there?

1118
01:16:22,883 --> 01:16:25,602
- Yeah.
- This is our only night together...

1119
01:16:26,923 --> 01:16:28,276
<i>and she...</i>

1120
01:16:30,083 --> 01:16:31,232
Here's the problem.

1121
01:16:31,323 --> 01:16:33,632
The problem is
that she wants a bottle of red wine...

1122
01:16:33,723 --> 01:16:35,361
and I don't have any money.

1123
01:16:38,123 --> 01:16:40,637
But I was thinking
that you might want to...

1124
01:16:41,243 --> 01:16:46,033
give me the address of this bar and
I would promise to send you the money...

1125
01:16:46,123 --> 01:16:48,512
and you'd be making our night complete.

1126
01:16:48,723 --> 01:16:51,157
- You would send me the money?
- Yes.

1127
01:16:56,443 --> 01:16:57,762
Your hand?

1128
01:16:59,563 --> 01:17:00,678
Okay.

1129
01:17:13,203 --> 01:17:16,878
- For the greatest night in your life.
- Thank you very much.

1130
01:17:40,003 --> 01:17:43,200
So often I've been with people
and shared beautiful moments...

1131
01:17:43,283 --> 01:17:47,242
like traveling or staying up all night
and watching the sunrise.

1132
01:17:48,363 --> 01:17:50,672
And I knew those were special moments.

1133
01:17:51,483 --> 01:17:53,758
But something was always wrong.

1134
01:17:54,683 --> 01:17:56,833
I wished I'd been with someone else.

1135
01:17:58,363 --> 01:18:00,718
I knew that what I was feeling...

1136
01:18:00,803 --> 01:18:04,557
exactly what was so important to me,
they didn't understand.

1137
01:18:09,163 --> 01:18:11,358
<i>But I'm happy to be with you.</i>

1138
01:18:13,683 --> 01:18:16,151
You couldn't possibly know
why a night like this...

1139
01:18:16,243 --> 01:18:19,633
is so important to my life right now,
but it is.

1140
01:18:23,163 --> 01:18:26,678
- This is a great morning.
- It is a great morning.

1141
01:18:29,523 --> 01:18:32,162
Do you think we'll have others like this?

1142
01:18:33,803 --> 01:18:36,920
- What?
- What about our rational, adult decision?

1143
01:18:37,483 --> 01:18:38,757
Oh, yeah.

1144
01:18:43,523 --> 01:18:46,674
I know what you mean
about wishing somebody wasn't there.

1145
01:18:47,563 --> 01:18:51,715
It's just, usually it's myself
that I wish I could get away from.

1146
01:18:51,803 --> 01:18:53,839
Seriously, think about this.

1147
01:18:54,723 --> 01:18:57,999
I have never been anywhere
that I haven't been.

1148
01:18:59,123 --> 01:19:03,162
I've never had a kiss
when I wasn't one of the kissers.

1149
01:19:03,683 --> 01:19:08,393
You know, I've never gone to the movies
when I wasn't there in the audience.

1150
01:19:09,043 --> 01:19:13,241
I've never been out bowling
if I wasn't there making some stupid joke.

1151
01:19:13,323 --> 01:19:16,281
I think that's why so many people
hate themselves. Seriously.

1152
01:19:16,363 --> 01:19:20,481
It's just that they are sick to death
of being around themselves.

1153
01:19:21,523 --> 01:19:24,515
Let's say that you and I were together
all the time.

1154
01:19:25,243 --> 01:19:27,711
You'd start to hate
a lot of my mannerisms.

1155
01:19:27,883 --> 01:19:31,956
The way that every time
that we would have people over...

1156
01:19:33,123 --> 01:19:35,956
I'd be insecure,
and I'd get a little too drunk.

1157
01:19:36,083 --> 01:19:40,361
Or the way I tell the same stupid,
pseudo-intellectual story...

1158
01:19:40,443 --> 01:19:42,081
again and again.

1159
01:19:44,083 --> 01:19:46,438
You see, I've heard all those stories...

1160
01:19:46,523 --> 01:19:48,832
so of course I'm sick of myself.

1161
01:19:53,043 --> 01:19:54,840
<i>But being with you...</i>

1162
01:19:56,563 --> 01:19:59,361
it's made me feel
like I was somebody else.

1163
01:20:00,683 --> 01:20:04,358
I mean, the only other way
to lose yourself like that is...

1164
01:20:05,443 --> 01:20:08,719
you know, dancing, or alcohol...

1165
01:20:10,443 --> 01:20:12,718
or drugs, or stuff like that.

1166
01:20:15,603 --> 01:20:16,831
Fucking.

1167
01:20:18,403 --> 01:20:20,633
Fucking, yeah. That's one way.

1168
01:20:34,763 --> 01:20:36,481
Do you know what I want?

1169
01:20:37,603 --> 01:20:38,672
What?

1170
01:20:42,083 --> 01:20:43,516
To be kissed.

1171
01:20:46,803 --> 01:20:48,634
Well, I could do that.

1172
01:21:01,683 --> 01:21:02,718
Wait.

1173
01:21:06,563 --> 01:21:08,793
I have to say something stupid.

1174
01:21:10,283 --> 01:21:11,318
All right.

1175
01:21:12,803 --> 01:21:14,395
It's very stupid.

1176
01:21:17,323 --> 01:21:19,632
I don't think we should sleep together.

1177
01:21:21,323 --> 01:21:25,316
I want to, but since we're never
going to see each other again...

1178
01:21:26,123 --> 01:21:28,000
it'll make me feel bad.

1179
01:21:28,763 --> 01:21:31,436
<i>I'll wonder who else you're with.
I'll miss you.</i>

1180
01:21:36,603 --> 01:21:41,119
I know. It's not very adult.
Maybe it's a female thing. I can't help it.

1181
01:21:42,403 --> 01:21:44,473
Let's see each other again.

1182
01:21:46,803 --> 01:21:50,398
No, I don't want you to break our vow
just so you can get laid.

1183
01:21:50,723 --> 01:21:54,477
<i>I don't want to just get laid.
I want to, I mean...</i>

1184
01:21:55,403 --> 01:21:57,439
I mean, I think we should.

1185
01:21:58,563 --> 01:22:00,758
We die in the morning, right?

1186
01:22:02,003 --> 01:22:04,801
- I think we should.
- Then it's like some male fantasy.

1187
01:22:04,883 --> 01:22:08,034
Meet a French girl on the train,
fuck her and never see her again.

1188
01:22:08,123 --> 01:22:11,001
And have this story to tell.
I don't want to be a great story.

1189
01:22:11,083 --> 01:22:13,995
I don't want this great evening
to just have been for that.

1190
01:22:15,283 --> 01:22:18,639
Okay, we don't have to have sex.
It's not a big deal.

1191
01:22:29,123 --> 01:22:31,193
You don't want to see me again?

1192
01:22:32,323 --> 01:22:33,438
No, of course I do.

1193
01:22:33,523 --> 01:22:36,242
If somebody gave me
the choice right now...

1194
01:22:36,323 --> 01:22:38,883
<i>of to never see you again,
or to marry you...</i>

1195
01:22:39,483 --> 01:22:42,998
<i>I would marry you.
Maybe that's a lot of romantic bullshit...</i>

1196
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:45,881
but people have gotten married
for a lot less.

1197
01:22:49,043 --> 01:22:50,158
Actually...

1198
01:22:51,763 --> 01:22:56,075
I think I decided I wanted to sleep
with you when we got off the train.

1199
01:22:59,683 --> 01:23:02,720
Now that we've talked so much,
I don't know anymore.

1200
01:23:12,883 --> 01:23:15,238
Why do we make everything
so complicated?

1201
01:23:15,323 --> 01:23:16,722
I don't know.

1202
01:24:16,043 --> 01:24:19,672
What's the first thing you'll do
when you get back to Paris?

1203
01:24:20,083 --> 01:24:22,392
Call my parents. What about you?

1204
01:24:23,403 --> 01:24:27,521
I don't know. I'll probably go
pick up my dog. He's with a friend.

1205
01:24:27,603 --> 01:24:29,321
You have a dog? I love dogs.

1206
01:24:29,403 --> 01:24:30,631
- You do?
- Yeah.

1207
01:24:31,003 --> 01:24:32,595
- Oh, shit.
- What?

1208
01:24:33,683 --> 01:24:36,151
I don't know. We're back in real time.

1209
01:24:36,563 --> 01:24:38,201
I know. I hate that.

1210
01:24:38,523 --> 01:24:39,956
What is that?

1211
01:24:41,883 --> 01:24:45,353
- Sounds like a harpsichord.
- Check that out.

1212
01:24:46,123 --> 01:24:47,795
Somebody's playing.

1213
01:24:54,403 --> 01:24:55,552
That's cool.

1214
01:25:13,243 --> 01:25:16,315
- Can we dance to the harpsichord?
- Of course.

1215
01:25:20,643 --> 01:25:22,918
- Wow.
- What?

1216
01:25:25,763 --> 01:25:27,674
I'm gonna take your picture...

1217
01:25:28,643 --> 01:25:30,281
<i>so I never forget you...</i>

1218
01:25:31,243 --> 01:25:33,711
or all this.

1219
01:25:34,643 --> 01:25:36,076
Okay, me, too.

1220
01:26:32,283 --> 01:26:35,480
"The years shall run like rabbits"

1221
01:26:38,043 --> 01:26:39,158
What?

1222
01:26:41,123 --> 01:26:42,442
Nothing.

1223
01:26:44,203 --> 01:26:48,162
I have this recording of Dylan Thomas...

1224
01:26:48,723 --> 01:26:52,841
reading a W. H. Auden poem.
He's got a great voice.

1225
01:26:55,163 --> 01:26:56,596
It's like:

1226
01:26:57,683 --> 01:26:59,833
"All the clocks in the city

1227
01:26:59,963 --> 01:27:01,999
"began to whirr and chime:

1228
01:27:02,963 --> 01:27:05,272
"'O let not Time deceive you

1229
01:27:05,523 --> 01:27:07,434
"'you cannot conquer Time

1230
01:27:08,283 --> 01:27:10,399
"'In headaches and in worry

1231
01:27:10,843 --> 01:27:12,834
"'vaguely life leaks away

1232
01:27:13,723 --> 01:27:15,759
"'And Time will have his fancy

1233
01:27:15,923 --> 01:27:17,993
"'Tomorrow or today"'

1234
01:27:19,083 --> 01:27:20,755
Something like that.

1235
01:27:21,643 --> 01:27:22,837
That's good.

1236
01:27:29,963 --> 01:27:33,478
When you talked earlier
about after a few years...

1237
01:27:33,843 --> 01:27:36,437
how a couple would begin
to hate each other...

1238
01:27:36,603 --> 01:27:40,642
by anticipating their reactions,
or getting tired of their mannerisms.

1239
01:27:41,283 --> 01:27:44,002
I think it would be the opposite for me.

1240
01:27:44,683 --> 01:27:48,722
I think I can really fall in love
when I know everything about someone.

1241
01:27:50,083 --> 01:27:53,962
The way he's gonna part his hair,
which shirt he's gonna wear that day...

1242
01:27:54,043 --> 01:27:57,513
knowing the exact story he'd tell
in a given situation.

1243
01:27:59,763 --> 01:28:02,800
I'm sure that's when I know
I'm really in love.

1244
01:28:22,883 --> 01:28:24,714
- Hey, guess what.
- What?

1245
01:28:25,563 --> 01:28:27,633
We didn't go to those guys' play.

1246
01:28:27,723 --> 01:28:28,951
- Play?
- Yeah.

1247
01:28:29,043 --> 01:28:30,271
- The cow?
- Yeah.

1248
01:28:30,363 --> 01:28:32,035
Oh, yeah, we didn't.

1249
01:28:32,323 --> 01:28:34,041
Oh, no. We missed it.

1250
01:28:59,163 --> 01:29:00,915
You know what bus
to take to the airport?

1251
01:29:01,003 --> 01:29:02,118
No problem.

1252
01:29:02,203 --> 01:29:05,195
- I should get on this one.
- Right here. You wanna get on there?

1253
01:29:09,123 --> 01:29:11,353
- I guess this is it, no?
- Yeah.

1254
01:29:12,243 --> 01:29:13,642
<i>I really...</i>

1255
01:29:19,243 --> 01:29:21,438
<i>- You know...
- Yeah, I know. Me, too.</i>

1256
01:29:27,923 --> 01:29:30,960
Have a great life.
Have fun with everything you're gonna do.

1257
01:29:31,043 --> 01:29:33,841
- Good luck with school and all that.
- Okay.

1258
01:29:34,763 --> 01:29:36,162
I hate this.

1259
01:29:37,123 --> 01:29:39,717
Me, too. The train is about to leave.

1260
01:29:47,003 --> 01:29:51,474
You know all this bullshit we're talking
about not seeing each other again?

1261
01:29:51,563 --> 01:29:53,679
- I don't want that.
- I don't want to, either.

1262
01:29:53,763 --> 01:29:55,481
- You don't?
- I waited for you to say it.

1263
01:29:55,563 --> 01:29:57,121
Why didn't you say something?

1264
01:29:57,203 --> 01:30:01,037
- I was afraid you didn't wanna see me.
- All right, what do you wanna do?

1265
01:30:02,763 --> 01:30:05,482
Maybe we should meet here
in five years or something.

1266
01:30:05,563 --> 01:30:07,440
Five years? That's a long time.

1267
01:30:07,523 --> 01:30:10,242
It's awful.
It's like a sociological experiment.

1268
01:30:10,723 --> 01:30:13,157
- How about one year?
- One year. All right.

1269
01:30:13,443 --> 01:30:15,513
- How about six months?
- Six months?

1270
01:30:16,363 --> 01:30:18,160
- It's gonna be freezing.
- Yeah.

1271
01:30:18,243 --> 01:30:20,803
Who cares? We come here,
we go somewhere else.

1272
01:30:24,003 --> 01:30:26,073
Six months from now or last night?

1273
01:30:27,483 --> 01:30:31,601
Last night. Six months from last night,
which was June 16.

1274
01:30:31,683 --> 01:30:35,995
So track nine,
six months from now at 6:00 at night.

1275
01:30:36,843 --> 01:30:38,037
December.

1276
01:30:38,323 --> 01:30:41,156
It's a train ride for you,
but I gotta fly all the way here.

1277
01:30:41,243 --> 01:30:42,801
But I'm gonna be here.

1278
01:30:43,043 --> 01:30:45,159
- Okay, me, too.
- All right.

1279
01:30:47,243 --> 01:30:49,711
- We won't call, write or...
- No, it's depressing.

1280
01:30:49,803 --> 01:30:51,680
- Yeah, okay.
- All right.

1281
01:30:53,563 --> 01:30:56,236
Your train's gonna leave. Say goodbye.

1282
01:30:57,643 --> 01:30:58,712
Bye.

1283
01:30:59,763 --> 01:31:00,912
Goodbye.

1284
01:31:01,763 --> 01:31:02,991
<i>Au revoir.</i>

1285
01:31:04,603 --> 01:31:05,752
Later.

1286
01:34:33,145 --> 01:34:35,075
Hold me like a mother would

1287
01:34:35,225 --> 01:34:38,625
Like I've always known
somebody should, yeah

1288
01:34:38,919 --> 01:34:41,338
Although tomorrow

1289
01:34:41,983 --> 01:34:44,386
It don't look that good

1290
01:34:45,462 --> 01:34:47,401
Well, it just goes to show

1291
01:34:47,568 --> 01:34:51,463
Though people say
We're an unlikely couple

1292
01:34:51,628 --> 01:34:53,468
I'm seeing double

1293
01:34:54,647 --> 01:34:56,270
Of you

1294
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:02,732
This is life

1295
01:35:02,988 --> 01:35:04,571
And everything's alright

1296
01:35:06,068 --> 01:35:10,114
Living, living, living...

1297
01:35:10,234 --> 01:35:10,641
Life

1298
01:35:11,381 --> 01:35:13,120
Oh, hope for the hopeless

1299
01:35:13,308 --> 01:35:17,523
I'm learning to cope
With the emotionless mediocracy

1300
01:35:20,179 --> 01:35:22,050
Day to day living

1301
01:35:23,602 --> 01:35:25,897
How can I help but be restless when

1302
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:29,258
Everything seems so tasteless and

1303
01:35:29,795 --> 01:35:32,601
All of the colors seem to have

1304
01:35:32,752 --> 01:35:35,352
Faded away

1305
01:35:39,207 --> 01:35:40,790
This is life

1306
01:35:41,134 --> 01:35:43,456
And everything's alright

1307
01:35:44,352 --> 01:35:48,241
Living, living, living...

1308
01:35:48,351 --> 01:35:49,249
Life

1309
01:35:49,511 --> 01:35:51,293
Hold me like a mother would

1310
01:35:51,981 --> 01:35:55,236
Like I've always known
somebody should, yeah

1311
01:35:55,543 --> 01:35:57,671
Although tomorrow

1312
01:35:58,694 --> 01:36:00,449
It don't look that good

1313
01:36:02,289 --> 01:36:04,233
Well, it just goes to show

1314
01:36:04,592 --> 01:36:08,647
Though people say
We're an unlikely couple

1315
01:36:08,783 --> 01:36:11,173
Doris Day

1316
01:36:11,597 --> 01:36:13,663
And Mott The Hoople

1317
01:36:21,222 --> 01:36:22,869
This is life

1318
01:36:23,269 --> 01:36:25,199
And everything's alright

Life
