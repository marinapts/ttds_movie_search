Wong Kar-Wai

10
00:00:59,324 --> 00:01:00,382
It is a restless moment.

11
00:01:00,591 --> 00:01:02,320
She has kept her head lowered...

12
00:01:02,427 --> 00:01:04,088
to give him a chance to come closer.

13
00:01:04,195 --> 00:01:05,822
But he could not, for lack of courage.

14
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,557
She turns and walks away.

15
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:10,760
HONG KONG, 1962.

16
00:01:15,473 --> 00:01:17,407
Eat up. The fish is very fresh today.

17
00:01:24,215 --> 00:01:25,944
Sorry to interrupt your dinner.

18
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,243
Never mind. Let's sit over here.

19
00:01:30,722 --> 00:01:32,485
It's quite late!

20
00:01:32,857 --> 00:01:34,484
I've just finished work.

21
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,691
What should I call you?

22
00:01:36,894 --> 00:01:38,418
You can call me Mrs. Suen.

23
00:01:38,629 --> 00:01:40,460
- And you?
- My husband's name is Chan.

24
00:01:40,631 --> 00:01:43,429
- Call me when you decide.
- I will.

25
00:01:44,002 --> 00:01:45,629
Did you write down my number?

26
00:01:45,937 --> 00:01:46,961
Yes, I did.

27
00:01:47,205 --> 00:01:48,832
Fine, I'll see you out.

28
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,667
- Don't trouble.
- No trouble!

29
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,419
So it's agreed then!

30
00:02:03,621 --> 00:02:04,952
Thank you very much! I should go.

31
00:02:05,156 --> 00:02:06,088
- Fine.
- Bye!

32
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,621
Take care. Good-bye!

33
00:02:09,127 --> 00:02:10,754
You've a room to let?

34
00:02:10,962 --> 00:02:14,659
Sorry, it's just been rented
to that lady.

35
00:02:15,233 --> 00:02:16,291
Thanks anyway.

36
00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:18,435
How many of you?

37
00:02:19,203 --> 00:02:20,864
Just me and my wife.

38
00:02:21,572 --> 00:02:23,164
Why don't you try next door?

39
00:02:23,408 --> 00:02:25,308
They've a vacant room too?

40
00:02:25,543 --> 00:02:30,344
Yes, Mr. Koo's son got married.
His room's empty.

41
00:02:30,982 --> 00:02:31,880
Thank you.

42
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,812
You're too polite. Try asking them.

43
00:02:34,018 --> 00:02:34,950
Thank you.

44
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:42,651
This way. Come on.

45
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,020
Not that room!

46
00:02:44,262 --> 00:02:45,991
Oops, wrong again!

47
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:51,296
Careful! Against the wall there.

48
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,198
The little cupboard over there.

49
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,570
Be careful!

50
00:03:01,546 --> 00:03:03,173
Don't break anything!

51
00:03:03,414 --> 00:03:05,382
Not on top of the radio!

52
00:03:06,084 --> 00:03:06,880
Mr. Chow...

53
00:03:07,085 --> 00:03:09,178
you have a lot of stuff for a couple!

54
00:03:09,921 --> 00:03:11,980
- The wardrobe isn't mine.
- Wrong again?

55
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,384
It goes next door.

56
00:03:13,591 --> 00:03:15,582
Okay, next door.

57
00:03:16,094 --> 00:03:20,030
These aren't my shoes!
They must go next door.

58
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:24,729
What a coincidence!
Moving in on the same day!

59
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,199
Is Mr. Chan here?

60
00:03:27,572 --> 00:03:30,268
He's working abroad.
He'll be back next week.

61
00:03:30,942 --> 00:03:33,035
You should have waited, then.

62
00:03:33,644 --> 00:03:36,204
It's too much for you on your own.

63
00:03:36,481 --> 00:03:39,041
- I can manage.
- I'll ask Amah to help.

64
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,013
No need. I can manage.

65
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:42,743
What's going on?

66
00:03:43,988 --> 00:03:45,046
Mind that mirror!

67
00:03:45,256 --> 00:03:46,883
Mrs. Chan, I'll leave you to it.

68
00:03:53,965 --> 00:03:56,229
- Those books aren't mine.
- Wrong again?

69
00:03:56,434 --> 00:03:57,867
Never mind. Just leave them there.

70
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:00,630
Mind how you hang the mirror.
It's fragile!

71
00:04:00,838 --> 00:04:02,465
Are these magazines yours?

72
00:04:03,508 --> 00:04:05,408
Yes, they're my husband's.

73
00:04:05,843 --> 00:04:07,470
He reads Japanese?

74
00:04:07,745 --> 00:04:09,610
A little. His boss is Japanese.

75
00:04:09,814 --> 00:04:11,372
How should I address you?

76
00:04:11,582 --> 00:04:12,640
My husband's name is Chan.

77
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:14,544
My name's Chow.
I'll leave you in peace.

78
00:04:14,752 --> 00:04:15,980
Thank you, Mr. Chow.

79
00:04:16,187 --> 00:04:17,245
Don't mention it.

80
00:04:20,158 --> 00:04:21,648
I'll ask Mrs. Chan.

81
00:04:24,795 --> 00:04:26,990
Mrs. Chan,
eat with us before you go!

82
00:04:27,231 --> 00:04:30,098
No, thanks.
I must dash to the airport.

83
00:04:30,368 --> 00:04:32,131
- Your husband's coming back?
- Yes.

84
00:04:32,336 --> 00:04:33,997
Then I won't keep you.

85
00:04:36,007 --> 00:04:37,634
- Going out?
- Yes.

86
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:41,371
Sorry I'm late!

87
00:04:41,646 --> 00:04:42,874
Amah, pour some beer.

88
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:45,816
Cheers!

89
00:04:47,351 --> 00:04:50,445
Mrs. Chow,
try some Shanghai dishes.

90
00:04:50,922 --> 00:04:53,618
Where is Mrs. Chan off to so late?

91
00:04:55,059 --> 00:04:57,357
Meeting her husband at the airport.

92
00:04:57,862 --> 00:04:59,489
So that's why she looks different.

93
00:05:58,155 --> 00:06:00,555
It's all packed.
Take care on your trip.

94
00:06:01,058 --> 00:06:02,025
I will.

95
00:06:05,496 --> 00:06:08,056
How long this time?

96
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:10,299
Two to four weeks.

97
00:06:11,102 --> 00:06:15,232
Remember to bring back
two more of those handbags.

98
00:06:15,573 --> 00:06:16,562
Who for?

99
00:06:16,774 --> 00:06:17,798
My boss.

100
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:19,135
Two of them?

101
00:06:19,477 --> 00:06:21,035
You know why.

102
00:06:21,245 --> 00:06:22,872
Different colors?

103
00:06:24,248 --> 00:06:26,273
The same will do! Who cares?

104
00:06:27,351 --> 00:06:28,648
Whatever!

105
00:06:39,797 --> 00:06:45,167
Mrs. Ho.
Mr. Ho is still in a meeting.

106
00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:48,133
He'll be home late.
Please don't wait to eat.

107
00:06:51,175 --> 00:06:53,234
Yes. We're so busy at the moment.

108
00:06:54,845 --> 00:06:57,780
Yes. I'll ask him to call you
when he gets back.

109
00:07:06,724 --> 00:07:08,453
Did you call my wife?

110
00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:10,957
Yes, I said you'd be back later.

111
00:07:11,896 --> 00:07:13,329
Have you booked the restaurant?

112
00:07:13,531 --> 00:07:14,691
A table for two at 8:00.

113
00:07:15,299 --> 00:07:18,200
Miss Yu called
to say she's on her way.

114
00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:23,497
I'll be back after dinner.
Can I bring you something?

115
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,938
No, thanks. I'll get my own.

116
00:07:26,977 --> 00:07:31,175
Leave when you're ready.
I'll lock up.

117
00:07:35,486 --> 00:07:37,283
- Good evening, Mr. Ho!
- Evening!

118
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,538
- Going out, Mrs. Chan?
- Yes.

119
00:08:02,913 --> 00:08:04,540
Going out so late?

120
00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:06,376
Just getting some noodles.

121
00:08:06,851 --> 00:08:09,251
Amah is making pork soup. Join us.

122
00:08:09,453 --> 00:08:12,479
Thanks, I'm not really hungry.
I just want some air.

123
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,681
You're too polite.

124
00:08:14,892 --> 00:08:16,189
Next time!

125
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:22,859
They're all starving. We can eat.

126
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:26,696
Have you spoken to Ming?

127
00:08:28,205 --> 00:08:29,866
So I'll go with someone else!

128
00:08:31,642 --> 00:08:33,405
Just kidding!

129
00:08:33,944 --> 00:08:36,879
I'll be early tonight. See you soon!

130
00:08:45,256 --> 00:08:46,223
Chow!

131
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,557
Coming!

132
00:08:54,064 --> 00:08:58,694
Time to go! Finish it tomorrow!

133
00:08:59,136 --> 00:09:01,468
No, I'm nearly there.

134
00:09:01,772 --> 00:09:02,864
Oh, Ming.

135
00:09:03,808 --> 00:09:06,436
- I need a few days off next month.
- Why?

136
00:09:07,344 --> 00:09:10,370
I promised my wife a trip.
Put in a word for me, will you?

137
00:09:11,081 --> 00:09:13,641
I'll speak to personnel.

138
00:09:13,851 --> 00:09:15,819
But the next lunch is on you.

139
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,112
I will.

140
00:09:17,488 --> 00:09:18,648
Thanks, Ming!

141
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:22,619
It's ready!

142
00:09:22,993 --> 00:09:25,223
No, it'll switch itself off!.

143
00:09:26,797 --> 00:09:28,890
I told you, it's not ready!

144
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,798
A rice cooker!
It's yours, Mrs. Koo?

145
00:09:33,304 --> 00:09:37,331
No, it's beyond us!
It's Mrs. Chan's.

146
00:09:40,444 --> 00:09:41,934
My husband brought it from Japan.

147
00:09:42,146 --> 00:09:43,909
I wanted to show Mrs. Koo
how good it is.

148
00:09:44,682 --> 00:09:45,979
Now it's ready!

149
00:09:56,227 --> 00:10:00,857
Mrs. Chan, could Mr. Chan
get me one next time?

150
00:10:01,065 --> 00:10:02,157
No problem!

151
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:05,328
Mr. Chow, you should get one too!

152
00:10:05,636 --> 00:10:09,367
Your wife's so often late home.

153
00:10:11,242 --> 00:10:12,971
I couldn't trouble Mr. Chan.

154
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,144
It's just neighborly, isn't it?

155
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,877
It's no trouble!
I'll ask him to buy another next time.

156
00:10:20,684 --> 00:10:21,946
Thank you!

157
00:10:31,161 --> 00:10:33,721
Let's try the rice.

158
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:38,502
Mr. Chan, sorry to trouble you
about the rice cooker.

159
00:10:38,702 --> 00:10:40,363
It was really no trouble.

160
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,364
How much do I owe you?

161
00:10:44,742 --> 00:10:46,403
Your wife has already paid me.

162
00:10:46,777 --> 00:10:47,744
Really?

163
00:10:47,945 --> 00:10:49,640
She didn't tell you?

164
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,704
She's been working late shifts.

165
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,907
Often I'm asleep when she gets back.

166
00:10:54,118 --> 00:10:55,676
It must be hard for her.

167
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,852
Yes.

168
00:10:57,421 --> 00:10:59,013
Mrs. Chan isn't back yet?

169
00:10:59,223 --> 00:11:02,351
She'll be back soon.
You need to talk to her?

170
00:11:02,893 --> 00:11:04,758
A friend needs to go to Singapore.

171
00:11:04,962 --> 00:11:07,487
I wonder if she could get
a cheap ticket for him.

172
00:11:07,698 --> 00:11:09,222
I'll ask when she gets back.

173
00:11:10,701 --> 00:11:12,601
I'm bothering you too much.

174
00:11:12,803 --> 00:11:15,670
Don't mention it. We're neighbors!

175
00:11:16,574 --> 00:11:18,269
I'll leave you in peace.

176
00:11:24,715 --> 00:11:25,909
Looking for me?

177
00:11:26,216 --> 00:11:29,117
Damn right. Where've you been?

178
00:11:29,787 --> 00:11:31,015
What's up?

179
00:11:31,722 --> 00:11:35,624
Mrs. Chan called.
You left a hat at her office.

180
00:11:35,826 --> 00:11:38,624
I meant to!
I wanted an excuse to go back.

181
00:11:39,096 --> 00:11:40,723
I know your tricks!

182
00:11:41,932 --> 00:11:43,365
She's married.

183
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:45,535
I know, that's why I left.

184
00:11:45,736 --> 00:11:48,728
Otherwise I'd move in next door.

185
00:11:48,939 --> 00:11:52,705
If your wife wasn't so attractive,
she'd be a worried woman!

186
00:11:55,579 --> 00:11:57,206
I'm not like you.

187
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,145
Please call Mrs. Chan for me.

188
00:12:01,585 --> 00:12:02,984
I'll pick up the hat tomorrow.

189
00:12:03,187 --> 00:12:04,552
And take her to lunch!

190
00:12:05,422 --> 00:12:06,548
Dream on!

191
00:12:06,757 --> 00:12:09,590
She'll take the hat home.
I'll bring it in tomorrow.

192
00:12:10,461 --> 00:12:13,123
You're kidding!
Some buddy you are!

193
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,457
Tell you what,
let's go pick her up now!

194
00:12:17,301 --> 00:12:19,826
She should be off work by now.
We can go together!

195
00:12:20,471 --> 00:12:21,995
I don't have time for this.

196
00:12:22,206 --> 00:12:23,138
Chow!

197
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,900
Yes! Get out of here, I'm busy.

198
00:12:26,143 --> 00:12:28,839
Then I'll wait at your place.

199
00:12:30,547 --> 00:12:31,844
Ping!

200
00:12:40,157 --> 00:12:41,920
Mr. Chow, is Mr. Koo in?

201
00:12:42,226 --> 00:12:45,127
He's out...
Forgot to buy the paper again?

202
00:12:45,396 --> 00:12:46,761
That's right, I'll stop by later.

203
00:12:46,964 --> 00:12:49,194
- Maybe I can find it for you.
- Thank you.

204
00:13:00,244 --> 00:13:01,939
- This one?
- Yes.

205
00:13:03,313 --> 00:13:06,805
I always loved those serials.
Hated to miss an episode.

206
00:13:07,084 --> 00:13:08,779
Really? You liked them too?

207
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:12,377
I even thought of writing one!

208
00:13:12,823 --> 00:13:14,222
Why didn't you?

209
00:13:14,558 --> 00:13:16,856
I couldn't get started,
so I gave up.

210
00:13:17,194 --> 00:13:19,355
I wasn't born
to write martial arts stories!

211
00:13:19,563 --> 00:13:21,827
But you can borrow
from my collection anytime.

212
00:13:22,032 --> 00:13:25,024
Not now. Maybe another time.
Thanks.

213
00:13:25,235 --> 00:13:26,202
You're welcome!

214
00:13:34,044 --> 00:13:35,671
What is it? Mrs. Chan!

215
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,575
I just want to return these
to Mr. Chow. Is he in?

216
00:13:38,882 --> 00:13:40,850
He's been away for a few days.

217
00:13:41,051 --> 00:13:41,983
Why?

218
00:13:42,619 --> 00:13:44,246
They had a quarrel.

219
00:13:44,955 --> 00:13:49,324
Leave them with me.
I'll pass them back to him.

220
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,327
Thank you.

221
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,162
Forget it!

222
00:14:02,106 --> 00:14:04,870
I'm on a replacement shift tonight.

223
00:14:06,977 --> 00:14:08,604
Talk to you later.

224
00:14:12,783 --> 00:14:14,410
No need to pick me up!

225
00:14:17,387 --> 00:14:19,014
She's already left.

226
00:14:19,823 --> 00:14:23,054
Really? I was going
to take her out for supper.

227
00:14:23,761 --> 00:14:26,423
Didn't she tell you
she was off early today?

228
00:14:26,764 --> 00:14:29,358
She never remembers to tell me.

229
00:14:31,468 --> 00:14:33,197
Maybe she's home by now.

230
00:14:34,271 --> 00:14:35,431
I'll be off, then.

231
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:36,867
Okay, bye!

232
00:17:01,251 --> 00:17:02,183
Hello!

233
00:17:14,998 --> 00:17:16,192
You're out of hospital!

234
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,960
Don't mention hospital!
Lend me $30!

235
00:17:19,403 --> 00:17:20,370
What for?

236
00:17:20,737 --> 00:17:22,728
You gotta help me save face!

237
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,032
What's the big deal?

238
00:17:24,241 --> 00:17:25,936
It's Ah Hoi's fault.

239
00:17:26,143 --> 00:17:29,237
He gave me a racing tip,
said it was a sure thing.

240
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:34,212
Before they'd taken out the stitches...

241
00:17:34,418 --> 00:17:36,716
I bet everything I had.

242
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,547
And I lost my shirt!

243
00:17:38,855 --> 00:17:40,618
What did you expect?

244
00:17:41,358 --> 00:17:43,724
I thought it was my lucky day.

245
00:17:43,961 --> 00:17:45,656
Anyhow, I had only $2 left.

246
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:49,663
So I went to the whorehouse.

247
00:17:50,033 --> 00:17:51,967
You were in no shape for sex!

248
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:54,160
I thought it would improve my luck.

249
00:17:56,173 --> 00:17:58,641
What would $2 buy you?

250
00:17:59,676 --> 00:18:03,112
I'm Kwai-fei's regular.
She gives me credit.

251
00:18:03,947 --> 00:18:05,278
You can have it on credit?

252
00:18:05,482 --> 00:18:08,974
I left my I D card and said
I'd be back to redeem it.

253
00:18:09,486 --> 00:18:11,818
I thought a few dollars
would be easy to rustle up.

254
00:18:12,189 --> 00:18:14,282
But so far nothing.
I'm way overdue.

255
00:18:14,491 --> 00:18:15,116
So?

256
00:18:15,459 --> 00:18:17,290
Four Eyes was there yesterday.

257
00:18:17,494 --> 00:18:19,860
Saw her waving my I D
around in front of everyone.

258
00:18:20,063 --> 00:18:21,325
So embarrassing!

259
00:18:21,665 --> 00:18:23,292
Anyway, lend me $30!

260
00:18:29,806 --> 00:18:31,433
This is all I can spare.

261
00:18:32,209 --> 00:18:34,541
I need $10 for myself.

262
00:18:37,414 --> 00:18:39,109
Pay you back next month.

263
00:18:39,983 --> 00:18:42,213
- Let's have a late snack.
- What?

264
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:45,488
All I've had today
is some won-ton noodles.

265
00:18:45,722 --> 00:18:47,383
Let me finish writing this first.

266
00:18:50,861 --> 00:18:52,829
I'm not sure
I should tell you this--

267
00:18:53,663 --> 00:18:54,561
What?

268
00:18:54,765 --> 00:18:57,233
I saw your wife
in the street yesterday.

269
00:18:57,534 --> 00:18:59,161
So what?

270
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,835
She was with some guy.

271
00:19:08,545 --> 00:19:10,172
Probably a friend.

272
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:14,915
Just thought you should know.

273
00:19:21,191 --> 00:19:24,786
Mr. Ho's still in a meeting.
He says he can't manage dinner.

274
00:19:26,997 --> 00:19:29,022
Yes, we're very busy now.

275
00:19:33,103 --> 00:19:34,195
I will.

276
00:19:34,938 --> 00:19:36,872
I'll ask Mr. Ho to call.

277
00:19:42,512 --> 00:19:44,810
- Have you called Miss Yu?
- Yes, I have.

278
00:19:45,515 --> 00:19:46,482
What did she say?

279
00:19:46,683 --> 00:19:48,583
Asks you to call her later.

280
00:19:48,785 --> 00:19:51,413
And Mrs. Ho says she's ready
to cut her birthday cake.

281
00:19:51,621 --> 00:19:52,883
She wants you to hurry home.

282
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:55,581
- Did you get me a present for her?
- Yes, this.

283
00:19:55,792 --> 00:19:57,657
- What is it?
- A scarf.

284
00:19:58,128 --> 00:20:00,824
- I think Mrs. Ho will like it.
- Thank you.

285
00:20:01,398 --> 00:20:02,729
And here's your change.

286
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:06,391
I'm always troubling you.
Use it for bus fare.

287
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,564
Why don't you dine with us tonight?

288
00:20:09,806 --> 00:20:12,775
Thank you, I've already
planned to see a film tonight.

289
00:20:12,976 --> 00:20:14,671
Then I won't keep you.

290
00:20:14,945 --> 00:20:17,846
Tomorrow will be quiet.
Take the morning off.

291
00:20:28,225 --> 00:20:29,852
Are you going out tonight?

292
00:20:32,329 --> 00:20:34,058
Don't forget your keys.

293
00:20:34,264 --> 00:20:36,528
All the neighbors
are dining out tonight.

294
00:20:37,167 --> 00:20:40,864
I have a lot to do here.
I'll be late.

295
00:20:56,253 --> 00:20:57,880
What is it, Mrs. Chan?

296
00:20:58,288 --> 00:20:59,448
I heard voices,

297
00:20:59,656 --> 00:21:01,920
I thought Mr. and Mrs. Koo
were back.

298
00:21:02,325 --> 00:21:05,158
Not yet. Anything I can help with?

299
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,296
No, I just wanted a chat.

300
00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:12,492
- Are you alone?
- Yes, I am.

301
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:17,734
You're back early today!

302
00:21:18,441 --> 00:21:21,308
I came back to rest.
I'm not feeling well...

303
00:21:23,446 --> 00:21:25,971
What is it?
I have some medicines...

304
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:29,510
Don't trouble yourself,
I'll sleep it off.

305
00:21:31,888 --> 00:21:33,947
In that case...
I'll leave you in peace.

306
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:41,757
It was your wife.

307
00:21:44,501 --> 00:21:46,264
Have you spoken to your wife yet?

308
00:21:47,571 --> 00:21:49,436
Then we shouldn't meet anymore.

309
00:22:37,087 --> 00:22:38,748
Any news from the Philippines?

310
00:22:39,222 --> 00:22:40,348
Yes, a telex.

311
00:22:40,557 --> 00:22:42,491
There's a typhoon,
so the ship's still docked.

312
00:22:43,293 --> 00:22:48,162
Please inform Chan
that the shipment may be delayed.

313
00:22:48,565 --> 00:22:50,192
Ask if that's a problem.

314
00:22:53,903 --> 00:22:56,895
Your wife rang.
You don't need to pick her up.

315
00:22:57,107 --> 00:22:58,768
She's playing mahjong with Mrs. Lau.

316
00:22:58,975 --> 00:23:01,205
She'll meet you
at the restaurant at 5.30.

317
00:23:04,881 --> 00:23:06,439
And there's a gift from Miss Yu.

318
00:23:06,883 --> 00:23:08,180
She was here?

319
00:23:08,385 --> 00:23:10,114
No, she had it sent over.

320
00:23:10,387 --> 00:23:13,550
She says she'll dine alone
since it's your birthday.

321
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:16,356
Please phone her
when you have a moment.

322
00:23:18,461 --> 00:23:20,952
- I'll get you another coffee.
- Thank you.

323
00:23:44,254 --> 00:23:45,312
Thank you.

324
00:23:51,027 --> 00:23:52,654
That tie looks good on you.

325
00:23:53,263 --> 00:23:57,495
You noticed?
It's much like the old one.

326
00:23:59,102 --> 00:24:01,434
You notice things
if you pay attention.

327
00:24:13,817 --> 00:24:15,079
I'll be off now.

328
00:24:15,285 --> 00:24:18,482
If Chan has a problem,
let me know at the restaurant.

329
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,347
I will.

330
00:24:19,556 --> 00:24:20,818
Why did you change your tie?

331
00:24:21,024 --> 00:24:22,685
The new one was too showy.

332
00:24:22,892 --> 00:24:24,587
I should stick with my own.

333
00:24:24,794 --> 00:24:26,455
Don't forget to lock up.

334
00:26:13,336 --> 00:26:16,237
By the way,
haven't seen your husband lately.

335
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,734
He's abroad now,
on company business.

336
00:26:20,243 --> 00:26:22,803
That's why I see you
at the noodle stall.

337
00:26:24,113 --> 00:26:25,808
I don't like cooking for myself.

338
00:26:27,016 --> 00:26:29,382
Haven't seen your wife
lately either.

339
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:33,412
Her mother's ill.
She's at home with her.

340
00:26:35,091 --> 00:26:36,786
That explains it.

341
00:26:37,694 --> 00:26:38,820
Good night!

342
00:26:39,496 --> 00:26:40,326
Good night!

343
00:26:40,964 --> 00:26:42,591
Mrs. Chan, I'm glad you're back!

344
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,562
It's raining so hard!

345
00:26:44,767 --> 00:26:46,667
I was going to look for you
with an umbrella.

346
00:26:47,136 --> 00:26:48,103
You're too kind.

347
00:26:48,304 --> 00:26:49,498
Amah, who is it?

348
00:26:49,606 --> 00:26:50,368
It's Mrs. Chan.

349
00:26:50,473 --> 00:26:51,405
Mrs. Suen!

350
00:26:52,008 --> 00:26:56,308
Caught in the rain?
I said you could eat with us!

351
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,341
Next time... Enjoy your game.

352
00:27:01,784 --> 00:27:06,619
Her husband's always away.
It's sad to see her so lonely.

353
00:27:06,823 --> 00:27:10,850
She dresses up like that
to go out for noodles?

354
00:27:21,738 --> 00:27:23,933
Mr. Chow!
What are you doing here?

355
00:27:24,574 --> 00:27:26,439
Just calling Mrs. Koo to the phone.

356
00:27:28,077 --> 00:27:29,704
You're late back.

357
00:27:29,979 --> 00:27:31,674
I went to the pictures.

358
00:27:32,315 --> 00:27:33,942
I'll be going.

359
00:27:41,324 --> 00:27:42,348
Hello?

360
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:44,786
Yes, please hold on.

361
00:27:45,028 --> 00:27:47,053
- Who is it?
- It's for Mrs. Chan.

362
00:27:58,074 --> 00:28:01,840
It must seem odd to ask you out,
but I want to ask something.

363
00:28:02,245 --> 00:28:04,509
That handbag I saw you with
this evening...

364
00:28:04,714 --> 00:28:06,147
Where did you buy it?

365
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,911
Why do you ask?

366
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,980
It looked so elegant.
I want to get one for my wife.

367
00:28:17,293 --> 00:28:19,227
Mr. Chow, you're so good
to your wife!

368
00:28:20,396 --> 00:28:23,695
Not really! My wife is so fussy.

369
00:28:24,067 --> 00:28:27,161
Her birthday is some days away.
I don't know what to get her.

370
00:28:31,975 --> 00:28:34,205
Could you buy one
for me to give her?

371
00:28:35,144 --> 00:28:38,443
Maybe she wouldn't want one
just exactly the same.

372
00:28:40,583 --> 00:28:43,017
You're right, I didn't think of that.

373
00:28:44,654 --> 00:28:46,281
A woman would mind.

374
00:28:46,723 --> 00:28:49,521
Yes, especially since
we're neighbors.

375
00:28:52,328 --> 00:28:54,091
Do they come in other colors?

376
00:28:56,766 --> 00:28:58,734
I'd have to ask my husband.

377
00:28:59,435 --> 00:29:00,459
Why?

378
00:29:01,471 --> 00:29:04,634
He bought it for me
on a business trip abroad.

379
00:29:05,241 --> 00:29:06,902
They aren't on sale here.

380
00:29:10,947 --> 00:29:12,437
Then never mind.

381
00:29:19,322 --> 00:29:20,289
Actually...

382
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,583
I want to ask you something too.

383
00:29:24,694 --> 00:29:25,558
What?

384
00:29:26,996 --> 00:29:28,623
Where did you buy your tie?

385
00:29:31,634 --> 00:29:33,295
I don't know where it came from.

386
00:29:33,703 --> 00:29:35,933
My wife buys all my ties.

387
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:37,597
Really?

388
00:29:40,143 --> 00:29:45,604
She bought this one
on a business trip abroad.

389
00:29:46,115 --> 00:29:47,742
It's not on sale here.

390
00:29:49,118 --> 00:29:50,813
What a coincidence!

391
00:29:53,556 --> 00:29:54,523
Yes.

392
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:02,027
Actually...

393
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,164
my husband has one just like it.

394
00:30:08,371 --> 00:30:10,430
He said it was a gift from his boss.

395
00:30:11,007 --> 00:30:12,702
So he wears it every day.

396
00:30:17,914 --> 00:30:20,212
And my wife has a bag
just like yours.

397
00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:22,850
I know,

398
00:30:23,052 --> 00:30:24,178
I've seen it.

399
00:30:26,823 --> 00:30:28,950
What are you getting at, actually?

400
00:30:41,204 --> 00:30:43,502
I thought I was the only one
who knew.

401
00:31:02,425 --> 00:31:04,325
I wonder how it began.

402
00:31:20,443 --> 00:31:23,935
It's late.
Won't your wife complain?

403
00:31:24,947 --> 00:31:28,007
She's used to it. She doesn't care.

404
00:31:30,553 --> 00:31:31,850
And your husband?

405
00:31:32,655 --> 00:31:34,623
He must be asleep by now.

406
00:31:38,227 --> 00:31:39,956
Shall we stay out tonight?

407
00:31:47,637 --> 00:31:49,628
My husband would never say that.

408
00:31:52,608 --> 00:31:54,269
What would he say?

409
00:31:54,911 --> 00:31:57,141
Anyhow, he wouldn't say that.

410
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,777
Someone must have made
the first move.

411
00:32:00,416 --> 00:32:02,111
Who else could it be?

412
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:10,582
It's late.
Won't your wife complain?

413
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,920
She's used to it. She doesn't care.

414
00:32:15,364 --> 00:32:16,956
And your husband?

415
00:32:17,834 --> 00:32:19,825
He must be asleep by now.

416
00:32:41,457 --> 00:32:43,118
I can't say it.

417
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:49,157
I understand.

418
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,491
After all, it's already happened.

419
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:56,536
It doesn't matter
who made the first move.

420
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:02,641
Do you really know your wife?

421
00:33:32,775 --> 00:33:34,367
You order for me.

422
00:33:34,877 --> 00:33:35,844
Why?

423
00:33:39,782 --> 00:33:42,080
I've no idea what your wife likes.

424
00:33:52,628 --> 00:33:54,493
What about your husband?

425
00:34:35,972 --> 00:34:37,030
Like it hot?

426
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:43,073
Your wife likes hot dishes.

427
00:35:11,674 --> 00:35:14,006
Why did you call me
at the office today?

428
00:35:18,981 --> 00:35:21,916
I had nothing to do.
I wanted to hear your voice.

429
00:35:27,023 --> 00:35:28,820
You have my husband down pat.

430
00:35:29,025 --> 00:35:30,652
He's a real sweet-talker.

431
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,181
Why didn't you call me today?

432
00:36:00,389 --> 00:36:02,448
I was afraid you won't like it.

433
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,228
Then don't call me again.

434
00:36:22,344 --> 00:36:24,676
Mrs. Chan!
A letter from your husband.

435
00:36:27,616 --> 00:36:29,914
It's not for me,
it's for Mr. Chow next door.

436
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:34,419
The Japanese stamp made me think
it was your husband.

437
00:36:35,291 --> 00:36:36,918
So I was wrong.

438
00:36:53,542 --> 00:36:55,169
Your wife's in Japan?

439
00:36:57,213 --> 00:36:58,544
How did you know?

440
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:02,711
What did she say in her letter?

441
00:37:03,419 --> 00:37:04,681
Nothing special.

442
00:37:06,822 --> 00:37:08,551
Anything about
when she'd be back?

443
00:37:10,392 --> 00:37:11,256
No.

444
00:37:12,595 --> 00:37:15,029
What do you think
they're doing right now?

445
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:53,392
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

446
00:37:54,703 --> 00:37:56,568
Please pull up here!

447
00:37:57,173 --> 00:37:58,231
Why?

448
00:37:58,841 --> 00:38:00,468
I'll get off first.

449
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,841
No, let me.

450
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:08,339
- Mrs. Chan!
- Ah Ping! You're back?

451
00:39:09,245 --> 00:39:10,234
Visiting Mr. Chow?

452
00:39:10,446 --> 00:39:13,142
Yes, I thought we'd have lunch.
But he isn't well.

453
00:39:13,349 --> 00:39:14,373
What's wrong with him?

454
00:39:14,583 --> 00:39:16,744
He's got a fever. He's all alone.

455
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,553
So I'm gonna buy him
something to eat.

456
00:39:20,222 --> 00:39:21,689
The congee downstairs
is quite good.

457
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:23,482
He doesn't want congee.

458
00:39:23,926 --> 00:39:25,518
What does he want?

459
00:39:25,761 --> 00:39:28,025
Can't taste anything,
so he wants sesame syrup.

460
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,595
Damned troublesome!

461
00:39:35,371 --> 00:39:37,100
Amah!

462
00:39:37,606 --> 00:39:40,200
Mrs. Suen, she's hanging
the washing on the roof.

463
00:39:40,576 --> 00:39:41,600
Oh, you're back.

464
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:43,107
Yes... You've been out?

465
00:39:43,312 --> 00:39:46,713
My mother's birthday is coming up.

466
00:39:47,116 --> 00:39:48,913
So I took her to buy some fabric.

467
00:39:49,118 --> 00:39:51,177
It took all day. I'm half dead!

468
00:39:51,654 --> 00:39:53,781
And I had my hair done.
Is it nice?

469
00:39:53,989 --> 00:39:55,047
Very nice!

470
00:39:55,257 --> 00:39:56,884
What are you cooking?

471
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,388
I had a sudden craving
for sesame syrup.

472
00:40:00,829 --> 00:40:03,457
That whole pot is for you?

473
00:40:03,999 --> 00:40:06,399
I thought I might as well
make a potful.

474
00:40:07,169 --> 00:40:08,966
You're so thoughtful!

475
00:40:09,738 --> 00:40:11,535
- Please try it.
- I will.

476
00:40:12,675 --> 00:40:14,006
What a coincidence!

477
00:40:14,209 --> 00:40:15,836
Going out?

478
00:40:16,045 --> 00:40:19,173
I'll buy some noodles. I'm starving.

479
00:40:19,381 --> 00:40:20,814
Hungry? Will you join me?

480
00:40:22,117 --> 00:40:23,175
No thanks.

481
00:40:24,019 --> 00:40:25,577
Just off work?

482
00:40:25,788 --> 00:40:27,380
You must be very busy.

483
00:40:27,589 --> 00:40:31,025
Actually, I've been to see a picture.

484
00:40:31,794 --> 00:40:33,591
Really? How was it?

485
00:40:34,063 --> 00:40:34,825
So-so.

486
00:40:35,431 --> 00:40:37,399
I used to like
going to the pictures.

487
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,697
You had many hobbies before.

488
00:40:39,902 --> 00:40:43,099
On your own,
you are free to do lots of things.

489
00:40:43,806 --> 00:40:45,671
Everything changes
when you marry.

490
00:40:46,075 --> 00:40:48,043
It must be decided together.

491
00:40:48,243 --> 00:40:49,335
Right?

492
00:40:52,247 --> 00:40:55,341
I sometimes wonder
what I'd be if I hadn't married.

493
00:40:55,951 --> 00:40:57,578
Have you ever thought of that?

494
00:41:00,122 --> 00:41:01,419
Maybe happier!

495
00:41:05,594 --> 00:41:08,461
I didn't know married life
would be so complicated!

496
00:41:09,832 --> 00:41:11,390
When you're single,

497
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,534
you are only responsible
to yourself.

498
00:41:14,436 --> 00:41:16,404
Once you're married,

499
00:41:17,406 --> 00:41:19,738
doing well on your own
is not enough.

500
00:41:21,944 --> 00:41:25,971
Don't brood on it.
Maybe he'll be back soon.

501
00:41:29,752 --> 00:41:31,310
What about you?

502
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,215
Actually, we're in the same boat.

503
00:41:36,658 --> 00:41:38,421
But I don't brood on it.

504
00:41:39,461 --> 00:41:41,156
It's not my fault.

505
00:41:41,964 --> 00:41:44,762
I can't waste time
wondering if I made mistakes.

506
00:41:44,967 --> 00:41:46,798
Life's too short for that.

507
00:41:48,137 --> 00:41:49,798
Something must change.

508
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,001
So what's your plan?

509
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:58,077
I want to write a martial-arts serial.

510
00:41:59,047 --> 00:42:02,278
Actually, I've started one.
I'll show it to you.

511
00:42:02,684 --> 00:42:03,651
Great!

512
00:42:04,653 --> 00:42:07,622
You like them too,
so why not help me write it?

513
00:42:07,823 --> 00:42:11,350
I wouldn't know how,
I only read them!

514
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,755
We could discuss it together.

515
00:42:15,063 --> 00:42:16,826
All right, I'll try my best.

516
00:42:18,634 --> 00:42:20,465
I never thanked you
for the sesame syrup.

517
00:42:20,836 --> 00:42:24,101
There's no need,
I was making it anyway.

518
00:42:25,374 --> 00:42:28,935
Amazing! I was craving
some sesame syrup that day.

519
00:42:29,878 --> 00:42:31,812
Really? What a coincidence!

520
00:42:32,147 --> 00:42:33,637
It really was!

521
00:42:35,517 --> 00:42:36,711
I'll go for those noodles.

522
00:45:04,566 --> 00:45:07,364
Again! Halfway through dinner,
he's drunk! Disgusting!

523
00:45:07,569 --> 00:45:10,663
I told you to stop!
What can you do?

524
00:45:18,847 --> 00:45:19,836
It's me!

525
00:45:20,048 --> 00:45:21,481
You scared me.

526
00:45:21,683 --> 00:45:23,310
How's Mr. Koo?

527
00:45:23,652 --> 00:45:25,313
Drunk, as usual.

528
00:45:34,396 --> 00:45:36,296
I didn't expect them back so early!

529
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:41,528
Since you're trapped here,
finish the noodles.

530
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,237
They'll probably go soon.

531
00:45:58,286 --> 00:45:59,913
Want some soup?

532
00:46:03,025 --> 00:46:04,720
Want some soup?

533
00:46:16,104 --> 00:46:18,664
Mrs. Suen! Playing here tonight!

534
00:46:19,574 --> 00:46:22,202
Yes, Mrs. Koo is dealing
with her husband.

535
00:46:22,978 --> 00:46:25,208
I could do that.

536
00:46:25,414 --> 00:46:27,678
No, we should not trouble you.

537
00:46:28,784 --> 00:46:31,116
Think you'll play all night?

538
00:46:31,319 --> 00:46:34,049
No, we'll just play eight rounds.

539
00:46:38,627 --> 00:46:40,424
They'll play till morning?

540
00:46:41,496 --> 00:46:43,293
Mrs. Suen says only eight rounds.

541
00:46:44,066 --> 00:46:45,590
You believe that?

542
00:46:51,907 --> 00:46:55,138
You get some rest.
I'll wake you when they leave.

543
00:46:55,944 --> 00:46:57,104
And you?

544
00:46:57,412 --> 00:46:59,277
I have a chapter to finish.

545
00:47:13,128 --> 00:47:14,755
Where have you got to?

546
00:47:15,163 --> 00:47:17,097
The drunken master just showed up.

547
00:47:17,299 --> 00:47:18,960
When did he get written in?

548
00:47:20,135 --> 00:47:21,261
Just now!

549
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:46,686
Mr. Chow, home so early?

550
00:47:46,895 --> 00:47:49,796
- I went out to buy some food.
- No work today?

551
00:47:49,998 --> 00:47:51,659
I don't feel so good,
I'm staying home.

552
00:47:51,867 --> 00:47:54,097
A sick man shouldn't eat
all that sticky rice.

553
00:47:54,402 --> 00:47:55,960
Some of it's for later.

554
00:47:56,171 --> 00:47:57,968
Don't stuff yourself!.

555
00:47:58,507 --> 00:47:59,371
Good morning!

556
00:47:59,574 --> 00:48:01,098
Good morning.
Finished your game?

557
00:48:01,309 --> 00:48:04,767
Not yet, but Mr. Yang has to work.

558
00:48:05,013 --> 00:48:06,674
Mr. Tsai is coming to replace him.

559
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:10,341
Did you call the office for me?

560
00:48:10,685 --> 00:48:11,811
Yes.

561
00:48:12,053 --> 00:48:13,714
What did you tell them?

562
00:48:14,055 --> 00:48:15,716
That you weren't feeling well.

563
00:48:16,992 --> 00:48:18,789
Did they ask who you were?

564
00:48:18,994 --> 00:48:19,892
No.

565
00:48:23,265 --> 00:48:25,233
Probably took me for your husband.

566
00:48:26,201 --> 00:48:28,897
Mr. Ho knows that he's away.

567
00:48:29,404 --> 00:48:31,031
Pretend he's come back.

568
00:48:40,015 --> 00:48:41,710
Maybe we're being too cautious.

569
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:44,081
I'm always round anyway.

570
00:48:44,286 --> 00:48:46,049
We shouldn't have panicked.

571
00:48:47,956 --> 00:48:51,050
Well, they did turn up
without warning.

572
00:48:51,259 --> 00:48:52,988
What would they assume?

573
00:48:56,231 --> 00:48:58,165
One can't put a foot wrong.

574
00:49:37,973 --> 00:49:38,940
You can go!

575
00:50:03,531 --> 00:50:06,125
- Amah!
- Mrs. Chan! You're back very late!

576
00:50:06,868 --> 00:50:08,768
I had a lot of work today.

577
00:50:09,204 --> 00:50:11,798
I didn't see you leave this morning.

578
00:50:12,007 --> 00:50:13,975
I had breakfast with my mother.

579
00:50:14,175 --> 00:50:15,836
You weren't here when I left.

580
00:50:17,445 --> 00:50:18,173
Where's Mrs. Suen?

581
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:22,339
Asleep.
She played mahjong all day.

582
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:24,677
- Be quiet, don't wake her.
- All right!

583
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:27,017
Mrs. Chan, is your leg all right?

584
00:50:27,222 --> 00:50:29,281
It's these new shoes.

585
00:51:15,537 --> 00:51:17,596
Why a special dinner tonight?

586
00:51:18,173 --> 00:51:22,109
Since you won't take
your share of the writing fee...

587
00:51:23,611 --> 00:51:26,273
All I did was give you some thoughts.

588
00:51:27,482 --> 00:51:29,814
Someone else
is asking for a serial too.

589
00:51:30,185 --> 00:51:31,914
There'll be more work soon.

590
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:35,920
Really? So quickly?
Isn't the workload too much?

591
00:51:36,191 --> 00:51:38,318
That's why
I'm looking for a new place.

592
00:51:39,227 --> 00:51:40,285
What for?

593
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:43,190
To write in!

594
00:51:44,399 --> 00:51:46,333
It'll be more convenient.

595
00:51:47,035 --> 00:51:50,835
There's nothing between us,
but I don't want gossip.

596
00:51:52,841 --> 00:51:54,468
What do you think?

597
00:51:55,577 --> 00:51:57,477
Why waste money?

598
00:51:58,179 --> 00:52:02,377
You don't need me.
You can write on your own.

599
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:44,090
Who do you want?

600
00:52:44,292 --> 00:52:45,987
Chow Mo-Wan?

601
00:52:46,261 --> 00:52:48,559
He hasn't been in for several days.

602
00:52:51,433 --> 00:52:53,333
We're looking for him too.

603
00:52:55,303 --> 00:52:57,567
May I know who's calling?

604
00:53:00,208 --> 00:53:01,835
Any message?

605
00:53:03,812 --> 00:53:05,905
It's no trouble. Good-bye.

606
00:53:18,393 --> 00:53:20,418
Please get this to Accounts.

607
00:53:20,628 --> 00:53:23,096
And have the air-conditioner
serviced tomorrow.

608
00:53:23,431 --> 00:53:24,363
Mr. Ho!

609
00:53:25,967 --> 00:53:28,197
No need to stay
if everything's done.

610
00:53:28,403 --> 00:53:30,064
- I'll lock up.
- Yes.

611
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:43,208
Hello?

612
00:53:48,656 --> 00:53:50,283
Where are you?

613
00:54:54,288 --> 00:54:55,983
I'll come again tomorrow.

614
00:54:56,791 --> 00:54:59,089
No need.
I'll be all right after some rest.

615
00:55:00,194 --> 00:55:01,923
It's no trouble.

616
00:55:02,797 --> 00:55:05,357
I'll bring you some food.
What would you like?

617
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:06,994
Whatever.

618
00:55:07,769 --> 00:55:10,533
Then I'll leave now. Get some rest.

619
00:55:10,805 --> 00:55:12,534
Call me when you get home.

620
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,907
Let it ring three times,
then hang up.

621
00:55:16,811 --> 00:55:17,436
All right.

622
00:55:24,952 --> 00:55:26,681
I didn't think you'd come.

623
00:55:30,725 --> 00:55:32,522
We won't be like them.

624
00:55:34,328 --> 00:55:35,352
See you tomorrow.

625
00:57:51,832 --> 00:57:53,561
Tell me honestly...

626
00:57:56,437 --> 00:57:58,234
do you have a mistress?

627
00:58:01,008 --> 00:58:02,635
You're crazy!

628
00:58:05,513 --> 00:58:07,140
Who told you I had?

629
00:58:07,381 --> 00:58:09,008
Never mind who.

630
00:58:09,951 --> 00:58:11,646
Do you or don't you?

631
00:58:14,355 --> 00:58:15,379
No.

632
00:58:20,928 --> 00:58:22,589
Don't lie!

633
00:58:23,965 --> 00:58:25,728
Look at me.

634
00:58:30,705 --> 00:58:33,037
I'm asking you,
do you have a mistress?

635
00:58:37,712 --> 00:58:38,679
Yes!

636
00:58:44,885 --> 00:58:46,580
That's no reaction!

637
00:58:47,622 --> 00:58:51,922
If he admits it outright,
let him have it!

638
00:58:55,663 --> 00:58:58,063
I wasn't expecting
he would admit it so easily.

639
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:01,594
I didn't know how to react!

640
00:59:03,904 --> 00:59:05,098
One more time, all right?

641
00:59:23,024 --> 00:59:24,958
Tell me frankly.

642
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,957
Do you have a mistress?

643
00:59:31,799 --> 00:59:33,130
You're crazy!

644
00:59:38,706 --> 00:59:40,333
Who told you that?

645
00:59:41,876 --> 00:59:45,141
Never mind that.
Do you or don't you?

646
00:59:50,685 --> 00:59:51,743
No.

647
00:59:54,388 --> 00:59:56,015
Don't lie!

648
00:59:56,524 --> 00:59:58,253
Tell me!

649
00:59:59,393 --> 01:00:00,655
Look at me.

650
01:00:01,295 --> 01:00:02,853
Do you have a mistress?

651
01:00:12,406 --> 01:00:13,338
Yes!

652
01:00:40,101 --> 01:00:41,728
Are you all right?

653
01:00:45,206 --> 01:00:47,470
I didn't expect it to hurt so much.

654
01:00:56,917 --> 01:00:59,477
This is just a rehearsal.

655
01:01:02,923 --> 01:01:05,050
He won't really admit it so readily.

656
01:01:05,626 --> 01:01:09,062
It's all right. Don't take it so hard.

657
01:01:13,801 --> 01:01:15,962
You've been out a lot lately.

658
01:01:16,203 --> 01:01:17,261
Yes.

659
01:01:19,473 --> 01:01:23,273
It's right to enjoy yourself
while you're young.

660
01:01:24,211 --> 01:01:26,145
But don't overdo it.

661
01:01:29,183 --> 01:01:31,083
When will your husband be back?

662
01:01:31,619 --> 01:01:33,246
Soon!

663
01:01:34,388 --> 01:01:38,654
In future,
don't let him travel so much.

664
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:42,827
A couple should spend time
together.

665
01:01:43,731 --> 01:01:45,494
Don't you agree?

666
01:01:47,668 --> 01:01:48,692
Good night.

667
01:02:10,724 --> 01:02:12,453
Will you come over tonight?

668
01:02:12,927 --> 01:02:14,189
What for?

669
01:02:14,395 --> 01:02:16,955
The editor's hounding me.
He says I'm too slow.

670
01:02:17,164 --> 01:02:19,462
I need your help.
When can you come?

671
01:02:20,601 --> 01:02:22,831
Not anytime soon.

672
01:02:23,504 --> 01:02:24,835
Why not?

673
01:02:25,506 --> 01:02:28,304
Mrs. Suen lectured me last night.

674
01:02:28,676 --> 01:02:30,234
What did she say?

675
01:02:30,444 --> 01:02:32,071
Rather not say.

676
01:02:32,413 --> 01:02:34,847
We shouldn't see so much
of each other.

677
01:02:46,026 --> 01:02:48,756
Mrs. Chan,
going out for noodles again?

678
01:02:49,029 --> 01:02:52,897
Not tonight.
I'll make myself something.

679
01:02:53,767 --> 01:02:59,831
Join us.
We're having vegetable won-tons!

680
01:03:00,107 --> 01:03:01,165
All right.

681
01:05:33,227 --> 01:05:35,058
- No lunch today, Mr. Ho?
- No.

682
01:05:36,797 --> 01:05:39,163
A Mr. Chow just called for you.

683
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,231
He wants you to call him back.

684
01:05:44,405 --> 01:05:45,372
Thank you.

685
01:06:18,405 --> 01:06:20,566
- Back from work?
- Yes.

686
01:06:22,443 --> 01:06:25,071
- Strange weather!
- Isn't it?

687
01:06:25,746 --> 01:06:27,304
Been here long?

688
01:06:27,514 --> 01:06:29,141
Just a while.

689
01:06:31,251 --> 01:06:33,048
I don't think it'll stop soon.

690
01:06:35,255 --> 01:06:36,244
Wait for me.

691
01:07:05,052 --> 01:07:06,679
I'll see you home.

692
01:07:07,154 --> 01:07:10,521
We'd better not be seen together.

693
01:07:12,226 --> 01:07:14,091
Then you go first.

694
01:07:16,163 --> 01:07:17,858
If they see your umbrella...

695
01:07:18,065 --> 01:07:20,465
they'll know I was with you.

696
01:07:22,870 --> 01:07:24,531
I wasn't thinking.

697
01:07:28,075 --> 01:07:31,203
You go first, I'll wait a while.

698
01:07:33,347 --> 01:07:35,042
I'll keep you company.

699
01:07:57,037 --> 01:07:58,732
Did you try to call me?

700
01:08:00,874 --> 01:08:03,240
I wasn't sure you got the message.

701
01:08:04,077 --> 01:08:06,068
Could you get me a boat ticket?

702
01:08:08,282 --> 01:08:10,079
To where?

703
01:08:11,451 --> 01:08:13,681
Ah Ping wrote from Singapore.

704
01:08:14,021 --> 01:08:17,548
They're short of staff.
He'd like me to go and help.

705
01:08:21,695 --> 01:08:23,390
How long will you stay?

706
01:08:23,597 --> 01:08:26,191
Don't know. I'll play it by ear.

707
01:08:31,371 --> 01:08:33,362
Why rush off to Singapore?

708
01:08:35,309 --> 01:08:37,004
A change of scene.

709
01:08:38,879 --> 01:08:40,779
I've had enough of the gossip.

710
01:08:42,616 --> 01:08:44,709
We know it's not true,
so why worry?

711
01:08:48,722 --> 01:08:53,091
I used to think that too,
and it didn't worry me.

712
01:08:56,763 --> 01:08:58,754
I thought we wouldn't be like them.

713
01:09:03,136 --> 01:09:04,797
But I was wrong.

714
01:09:07,674 --> 01:09:09,733
You won't leave your husband.

715
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:14,208
So I'd rather go away.

716
01:09:21,188 --> 01:09:23,713
I didn't think
you'd fall in love with me.

717
01:09:24,825 --> 01:09:26,622
I didn't either.

718
01:09:31,832 --> 01:09:34,266
I was only curious
to know how it started.

719
01:09:35,369 --> 01:09:37,064
Now I know.

720
01:09:38,839 --> 01:09:40,898
Feelings can creep up just like that.

721
01:09:45,045 --> 01:09:46,808
I thought I was in control.

722
01:09:47,848 --> 01:09:50,339
But I hate to think
of your husband coming home.

723
01:09:51,451 --> 01:09:52,918
I wish he'd stay away!

724
01:09:54,688 --> 01:09:56,178
I'm so bad!

725
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:01,925
Will you do me one favor?

726
01:10:03,163 --> 01:10:04,152
What?

727
01:10:05,732 --> 01:10:07,495
I want to be prepared.

728
01:11:04,257 --> 01:11:06,248
You'd better not see me again.

729
01:11:11,365 --> 01:11:13,162
Is your husband back?

730
01:11:14,201 --> 01:11:15,168
Yes.

731
01:11:17,437 --> 01:11:19,098
Am I hopeless?

732
01:11:21,441 --> 01:11:22,840
Not really.

733
01:11:33,253 --> 01:11:35,016
I won't see you again.

734
01:11:37,491 --> 01:11:39,356
Keep a closer eye on your husband.

735
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,763
Please.

736
01:12:22,969 --> 01:12:25,130
Don't be serious,
it's only a rehearsal.

737
01:12:26,606 --> 01:12:27,971
Don't cry!

738
01:12:32,479 --> 01:12:34,140
This isn't real.

739
01:13:24,431 --> 01:13:26,296
I don't want to go home tonight.

740
01:13:53,026 --> 01:13:57,486
Mei-Yi wants to dedicate a song
to her honeymooning friends.

741
01:13:57,697 --> 01:14:02,498
And Mrs. Cheung wishes the best
to her neighbors.

742
01:14:03,203 --> 01:14:05,603
And Mr. Chan,
now on business in Japan,

743
01:14:05,805 --> 01:14:11,766
wants to wish his wife
a happy birthday.

744
01:14:12,045 --> 01:14:16,880
So let's all enjoy Zhou Xuan
singing in "Full Bloom".

745
01:15:57,851 --> 01:15:59,011
It's me.

746
01:16:00,587 --> 01:16:02,316
If there's an extra ticket...

747
01:16:03,523 --> 01:16:04,956
would you go with me?

748
01:18:33,573 --> 01:18:34,938
It's me.

749
01:18:36,042 --> 01:18:38,169
If there's an extra ticket...

750
01:18:38,545 --> 01:18:40,479
would you go with me?

751
01:18:52,091 --> 01:18:54,651
SINGAPORE, 1963.

752
01:18:57,197 --> 01:18:59,290
Mr. Chow has gone to work.

753
01:19:00,166 --> 01:19:01,963
Any message?

754
01:19:03,369 --> 01:19:04,996
You're welcome!

755
01:19:35,034 --> 01:19:36,626
Has anyone been in my room?

756
01:19:36,836 --> 01:19:37,768
No.

757
01:19:38,204 --> 01:19:39,501
Something's missing.

758
01:19:39,839 --> 01:19:40,897
What?

759
01:20:11,304 --> 01:20:12,430
In the old days...

760
01:20:13,940 --> 01:20:19,242
if someone had a secret
they didn't want to share...

761
01:20:19,846 --> 01:20:21,575
you know what they did?

762
01:20:22,482 --> 01:20:24,279
Have no idea.

763
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:29,688
They went up a mountain,
found a tree...

764
01:20:31,791 --> 01:20:33,486
carved a hole in it...

765
01:20:34,294 --> 01:20:36,262
and whispered the secret
into the hole.

766
01:20:37,463 --> 01:20:39,590
Then they covered it with mud.

767
01:20:41,367 --> 01:20:45,463
And leave the secret there forever.

768
01:20:47,707 --> 01:20:51,803
What a pain!
I'd just go to get laid.

769
01:20:55,081 --> 01:20:56,742
Not everyone's like you!

770
01:20:58,284 --> 01:21:02,118
I'm just an average guy.
I don't have secrets like you.

771
01:21:02,555 --> 01:21:05,388
You bottle things up!

772
01:21:05,591 --> 01:21:07,422
Tell me something!

773
01:21:07,994 --> 01:21:09,689
I don't have secrets.

774
01:21:11,331 --> 01:21:13,424
Come off it, buddy!

775
01:21:14,434 --> 01:21:16,163
I won't tell anyone.

776
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:45,911
Hello, Singapore Daily.

777
01:23:46,586 --> 01:23:47,917
Hold on.

778
01:23:48,988 --> 01:23:50,751
Mr. Chow, call for you.

779
01:23:51,090 --> 01:23:52,114
Thanks!

780
01:23:55,261 --> 01:23:56,125
Hello?

781
01:24:02,235 --> 01:24:03,202
Hello?

782
01:24:52,051 --> 01:24:54,952
- Who is it?
- It's me.

783
01:24:55,655 --> 01:24:58,624
- Mrs. Chan, long time no see!
- Yes.

784
01:24:59,358 --> 01:25:01,258
- Amah, who's there?
- Mrs. Suen!

785
01:25:01,460 --> 01:25:03,485
What brings you here?

786
01:25:03,696 --> 01:25:05,425
It's been a while.

787
01:25:05,631 --> 01:25:09,089
I was nearby so I thought
I'd bring your boat ticket.

788
01:25:09,802 --> 01:25:10,791
And a small gift.

789
01:25:11,003 --> 01:25:14,302
You shouldn't have.
It's nice just to see you.

790
01:25:15,007 --> 01:25:16,167
The place is in such a mess!

791
01:25:16,375 --> 01:25:17,535
Already started packing?

792
01:25:17,743 --> 01:25:24,205
It's hopeless.
I can't bear to throw things away!

793
01:25:25,918 --> 01:25:27,613
Let's find you a seat.

794
01:25:31,724 --> 01:25:33,521
- Have some tea!
- Thank you!

795
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:38,392
Eat with us, Mrs. Chan!
I'm going to the market.

796
01:25:40,099 --> 01:25:43,227
I can't. I have work waiting.

797
01:25:43,869 --> 01:25:45,837
Don't rush off!.

798
01:25:46,339 --> 01:25:50,833
Mrs. Suen will be upset
if you don't eat here.

799
01:25:51,611 --> 01:25:53,579
Amah, pour me some tea too.

800
01:25:55,181 --> 01:25:56,808
How's your husband?

801
01:25:57,016 --> 01:25:58,643
He's fine, thank you.

802
01:25:58,751 --> 01:26:00,378
How long will you be away?

803
01:26:00,586 --> 01:26:02,213
I don't know.

804
01:26:02,421 --> 01:26:05,015
If I like it, I might stay!

805
01:26:05,825 --> 01:26:06,985
Why?

806
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:12,960
My daughter worries
about the situation in Hong Kong.

807
01:26:13,165 --> 01:26:15,998
I don't want to leave.

808
01:26:16,235 --> 01:26:22,299
Since the Koos left, I don't have
my mahjong partners anymore.

809
01:26:22,775 --> 01:26:28,372
And my daughter needs help
with her kids in the US.

810
01:26:31,684 --> 01:26:33,311
What about this place?

811
01:26:34,186 --> 01:26:36,313
I'm not sure...

812
01:26:37,923 --> 01:26:39,982
I don't want to sell it.

813
01:26:41,794 --> 01:26:43,819
So I might rent it out.

814
01:26:44,930 --> 01:26:46,659
How much would you want?

815
01:26:47,933 --> 01:26:49,662
You're interested?

816
01:26:49,869 --> 01:26:54,329
You could have it at a discount.

817
01:26:54,573 --> 01:26:56,165
I'll think about it.

818
01:26:56,375 --> 01:26:57,865
Mrs. Suen, your tea!

819
01:26:59,312 --> 01:27:01,712
Who lives next door now?

820
01:27:02,114 --> 01:27:08,451
I don't really know them.

821
01:27:08,821 --> 01:27:14,851
The Koos were almost like family!

822
01:27:16,295 --> 01:27:19,389
It was so nice then, wasn't it?

823
01:27:20,099 --> 01:27:21,031
Yes.

824
01:27:22,668 --> 01:27:24,295
Let's sit over here.

825
01:27:50,863 --> 01:27:51,830
Yes?

826
01:27:52,031 --> 01:27:53,362
Is Mr. Koo in?

827
01:27:53,566 --> 01:27:56,194
He moved long ago.

828
01:27:56,869 --> 01:27:58,496
Do you know where he is?

829
01:27:59,505 --> 01:28:01,166
You know him well?

830
01:28:01,741 --> 01:28:03,436
I used to live here.

831
01:28:04,710 --> 01:28:06,439
Is Mrs. Suen still next door?

832
01:28:06,846 --> 01:28:11,806
She's gone! It's too chaotic.
Everyone's running away.

833
01:28:12,818 --> 01:28:14,547
So who lives there now?

834
01:28:15,054 --> 01:28:19,514
A woman and her son.

835
01:28:19,725 --> 01:28:21,522
The kid is cute.

836
01:28:24,430 --> 01:28:29,026
No address in the Philippines.
Just his son's phone number.

837
01:28:32,571 --> 01:28:36,337
- I can't accept this!
- Please, you must.

838
01:28:36,709 --> 01:28:38,370
Thank you, then.

839
01:28:49,688 --> 01:28:51,315
That era has passed.

840
01:28:51,557 --> 01:28:54,355
Nothing that belonged to it
exists any more.

841
01:28:55,294 --> 01:28:56,818
Are you ready?

842
01:28:57,029 --> 01:28:58,894
- Okay!
- Let's go!

843
01:29:11,243 --> 01:29:14,701
CAMBODIA, 1966

844
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:19,579
The presidential corps waits
at Pochentong Airport...

845
01:29:19,985 --> 01:29:24,285
Prince Norodom Sihanouk
and Queen Sisowath Kossamak...

846
01:29:24,990 --> 01:29:26,719
come forward
to greet General De Gaulle.

847
01:29:33,799 --> 01:29:38,759
It's ten kilometers
from Pochentong to Phnom Penh.

848
01:29:39,939 --> 01:29:42,533
200,000 people line the route.

849
01:29:42,741 --> 01:29:45,073
A welcome unprecedented
in the history of the kingdom.

850
01:33:20,526 --> 01:33:23,586
He remembers those vanished years.

851
01:33:23,796 --> 01:33:27,596
As though looking through
a dusty window pane,

852
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:31,930
the past is something he could see,
but not touch.

853
01:33:32,137 --> 01:33:36,631
And everything he sees
is blurred and indistinct.

854
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:46,508
End

855
01:33:48,887 --> 01:33:51,048
