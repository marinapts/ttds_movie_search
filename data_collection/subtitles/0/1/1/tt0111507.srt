1
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,700
THREE COLORS
WHITE

2
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,700
THREE COLORS
WHITE

3
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:38,819
I have papen... a summons.

4
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,099
That way, sin

5
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,460
Can you tel! Us your concrete
reasons for wanting a divorce?

6
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:03,990
Can you tell us your concrete
reasons for wanting a divorce?

7
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,469
Concrete?

8
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,229
Yes, concrete.

9
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,509
Our marriage wasn 't consummated.

10
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,360
Our marriage wasn't consummated.

11
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:27,629
Is your wife's testimony
faithful to the facts?

12
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,509
In a manner of speaking.

13
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,949
But when we met in Poland,

14
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,030
and even here, at the beginning,
I think I gave my wife pleasure.

15
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,430
It's only aftenrvardsu.

16
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,629
We haven't made love
since we 're married.

17
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:14,030
We stopped... I stopped being
able to. It's just temporary.

18
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,180
Where's the equality?

19
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:31,100
Is my not speaking French
a reason for the court to refuse

20
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,660
to hear my case?

21
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,579
What is it

22
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:34,930
that you want?

23
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,259
I need time, Your Honon

24
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,220
I want to save our marriage.

25
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,889
I don 't believe
the love is gone.

26
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,180
One night, I was ready to...

27
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,819
Was the marriage consummated
that night?

28
00:05:19,829 --> 00:05:20,779
No.

29
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,019
I beg your pardon?

30
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,620
Do you love your husband?

31
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:45,420
I used to.

32
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,490
And now?

33
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,500
No.

34
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,699
I don 't love him anymore.

35
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,100
My God!

36
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:01,899
That's all.

37
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:14,610
Dominique!

38
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:55,500
ENTER YOUR CODE,
THEN PRESS "VALIDATE"

39
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,339
CARD CONFISCATED

40
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:14,899
Karo! Karol?

41
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,420
Your account is frozen.

42
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:19,819
Frozen?

43
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:22,060
Yes. Your card cannot be used.

44
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:24,060
It's invalidated. Canceled.

45
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,259
My card.

46
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,019
I can 't give it to you.

47
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,509
My money.

48
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,350
Police?

49
00:10:39,549 --> 00:10:40,529
No, no...

50
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:42,389
Please.

51
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:37,019
We!!?

52
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,110
Excuse me.

53
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,470
Come to Poland with me.

54
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,860
I'll never go with you.

55
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:49,710
I 'll win...

56
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:51,710
every trial.

57
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,710
The divorce,
property settlement...

58
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:00,070
You never understood a thing.

59
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:02,830
I understand.

60
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:03,950
No.

61
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,259
Lf! Say I love you,
you don 't understand.

62
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,039
And if! Say I hate you,
you still don 't understand.

63
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:18,220
You don 't understand
that! Want you,

64
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,190
that I need you.

65
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,259
Do you understand?

66
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:25,750
Do you understand?

67
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,870
No.

68
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,230
And now I scare you?

69
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:34,149
Do I scare you?

70
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,309
I don 't know.

71
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,429
You don't know.

72
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:44,029
Watch this, now.

73
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,110
Take a good look.

74
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,179
You were out for revenge.

75
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:59,230
You set the place on fire.

76
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:02,230
That's what happened.

77
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:09,350
Soon every cop in Paris
will be after you.

78
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,190
The keys!

79
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,950
Your fly is open.

80
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,710
I'm sorry.

81
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,750
How could you tell
I'm Polish?

82
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,590
I know that song.

83
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:39,470
What about this one?

84
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,269
I don't like it.

85
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:51,230
Do you live off that comb?

86
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,179
I try.
Times are tough.

87
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,750
What's that?

88
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,070
Diplomas.

89
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:05,830
Haird resser?

90
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:09,389
Not a bad job.

91
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,830
I've won competitions.

92
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:15,600
Sofia, Budapest, Warsaw.

93
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,629
Here too.

94
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:20,950
Where do you sleep?

95
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:24,029
In your suitcase?

96
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,470
Excuse me.

97
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:31,190
Mikolaj.

98
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:34,659
Karol.

99
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:38,309
There's an alcove...

100
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,110
Can I sit with you
for a while?

101
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:26,130
You do card tricks?

102
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,940
Pick thirteen cards.

103
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,019
Spades: 3, 4, Queen, King.

104
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,619
Diamonds: 2, 5, Ace.

105
00:17:45,829 --> 00:17:48,460
Clubs: 3, 5, King.

106
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,900
Hearts are weak: 2 and 4.

107
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,619
What counts in bridge
is memory.

108
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,779
And mine is excellent.

109
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:05,700
I've played bridge here
for a few years.

110
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,900
Now I'm going home.
What about you?

111
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,279
I want to get out of here.

112
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,940
I'll take you back.

113
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,980
Tomorrow morning.

114
00:18:27,549 --> 00:18:29,660
Ithink I doubt it.

115
00:18:32,109 --> 00:18:36,579
I lost my passport. I have
no money. The police are after me.

116
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:40,259
I'm down on my luck.

117
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:46,380
I'll make enough to buy a fake
passport near the Polish church.

118
00:18:46,589 --> 00:18:48,180
They're rip-off artists.

119
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:49,380
Rip-off artists.

120
00:18:49,589 --> 00:18:51,140
And not very serious.

121
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:55,700
I offered one of them a job.
He took the money and ran.

122
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,619
Maybe you'd like it.

123
00:18:58,950 --> 00:18:59,859
A good job?

124
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:03,230
Very good, but unpleasant.

125
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,940
I'm a hairdresser.

126
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,019
You have to kill someone.

127
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:15,700
He won't do it himself.

128
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:18,859
He doesn't want to go on living.

129
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:22,009
A Pole.

130
00:19:23,109 --> 00:19:26,579
He'll pay well.
Enough to live on for 6 months.

131
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:32,779
No, no... not that.

132
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,019
Why can't he do it himself?

133
00:19:36,269 --> 00:19:38,180
He wants to, but he can't.

134
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:42,500
He has a wife and children
who love him.

135
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:46,140
Imagine how they would feel.

136
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:49,099
This way, someone kills him
and it's over.

137
00:19:49,509 --> 00:19:52,579
He has a wife, children, money...
and wants to die?

138
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,779
What can I say?

139
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,309
My wife threw me out
with one suitcase.

140
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:02,900
And here I am.

141
00:20:05,109 --> 00:20:06,740
I still love her.

142
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,539
Even more than before.

143
00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:13,170
After all she did,
I still love her.

144
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,099
Is she pretty?

145
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:19,579
Beautiful.

146
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:25,579
I first saw her
at the Budapest competition.

147
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,339
I won that one.

148
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:29,500
A friend was doing her hair.

149
00:20:30,869 --> 00:20:32,700
She looked at me.

150
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:39,859
I'll show you.

151
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:41,900
Where?

152
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:43,500
Come on.

153
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,859
Brigitte Bardot?

154
00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:54,099
Beautiful.

155
00:20:54,589 --> 00:20:55,980
A bit over the hill, no?

156
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,170
There.

157
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,170
She's going to sleep.

158
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:20,660
You think so?

159
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,490
It's me.

160
00:21:59,349 --> 00:22:01,220
Perfect timing. Listen.

161
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,940
Dominique, I love you.

162
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:02,339
It stole two francs.

163
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,259
Your telephone stole two francs.

164
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:07,450
So what?

165
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,339
Give me back my stolen money.

166
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,579
Give it back!

167
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,539
You're taking me to Poland.

168
00:23:37,069 --> 00:23:38,180
I know how.

169
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:40,220
How?

170
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,289
Move your arm.

171
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:04,019
For air.

172
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,019
Can you last four hours?

173
00:24:09,509 --> 00:24:10,650
I'll last.

174
00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:13,140
I have one thing to do.

175
00:24:13,349 --> 00:24:14,329
What?

176
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,940
Steal something.

177
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:17,539
Nothing else from Paris?

178
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,140
No, why?

179
00:26:22,869 --> 00:26:24,420
Can I help you?

180
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,690
My suitcase is missing.

181
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:29,819
Ticket, please.

182
00:26:30,029 --> 00:26:30,619
Excuse me?

183
00:26:30,829 --> 00:26:32,740
Your ticket, please.

184
00:26:37,349 --> 00:26:38,859
The Paris flight?

185
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:41,579
What was in it?

186
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,299
Personal belongings.

187
00:26:43,589 --> 00:26:45,059
Clothes, shirts...

188
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:47,299
165 pounds?

189
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,619
To tell the truth,
my friend was in it.

190
00:27:38,829 --> 00:27:41,980
We'll divide it in 5 equal parts:
2 for me.

191
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,140
What?

192
00:27:43,349 --> 00:27:45,140
Handling charges.

193
00:27:48,069 --> 00:27:49,900
Fuck! It's alive!

194
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:52,099
What the fuck?

195
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:53,660
Get him out!

196
00:28:05,069 --> 00:28:07,859
Made in Russia! Fuck!

197
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:11,099
Stop it!
He may have a wallet.

198
00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:23,299
Two francs! Shit!

199
00:28:23,509 --> 00:28:24,650
Give that back!

200
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:27,500
Careful! He has scissors!

201
00:28:42,029 --> 00:28:43,539
The asshole's broke.

202
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,099
Let's split!

203
00:29:26,509 --> 00:29:27,859
Jesus...

204
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,619
home at last.

205
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:36,950
Jesus!

206
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,180
You're back.

207
00:30:39,109 --> 00:30:40,500
What happened?

208
00:30:40,869 --> 00:30:42,420
You bought a neon sign.

209
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,259
This is Europe now.

210
00:30:45,069 --> 00:30:47,700
Too bad
you missed Christmas.

211
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:49,619
Too bad.

212
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:56,099
Just a minute, please.

213
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,660
Jurek...

214
00:31:04,869 --> 00:31:06,299
I heard Karol's back.

215
00:31:06,509 --> 00:31:07,380
Well...

216
00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:09,259
he is.

217
00:31:23,309 --> 00:31:24,660
So?

218
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,630
They're asking for you.

219
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,059
The ladies.

220
00:31:30,269 --> 00:31:32,019
Give me a few days.

221
00:31:32,589 --> 00:31:34,740
I brought you some broth.

222
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:43,450
Sleep.

223
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:48,619
Sleep, sleep...

224
00:33:17,269 --> 00:33:20,259
Karol, remember you have
an appointment today.

225
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:21,980
Thank you.

226
00:33:26,109 --> 00:33:27,420
What's up?

227
00:33:32,269 --> 00:33:33,019
What is it?

228
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,740
It's payday.

229
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,990
You have clients waiting.

230
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,299
I can't today.
You do them.

231
00:33:40,509 --> 00:33:42,660
They don't want me anymore.

232
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,369
The door!

233
00:34:00,309 --> 00:34:01,819
Sorry.

234
00:34:02,029 --> 00:34:03,009
What is it?

235
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,670
I have an appointment.
Jadwiga told me...

236
00:34:06,869 --> 00:34:07,930
You do her hair?

237
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:09,409
Yes.

238
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,690
Is that all?

239
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,539
Okay.

240
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,019
What do you want?

241
00:34:18,269 --> 00:34:21,300
I'd like to get
into the money business.

242
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:24,219
In my line,
it takes years to get ahead.

243
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,340
I'll say!

244
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:29,420
I heard about
how you got out of Paris.

245
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,940
You're inconspicuous.

246
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,460
That's good.
I need a guard.

247
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:42,300
Relax.
It just shoots tear-gas.

248
00:34:46,869 --> 00:34:48,659
Go wander around outside.

249
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,659
Present perfect.

250
00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:38,250
I have eaten. You have eaten.
He has eaten.

251
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:42,900
We have eaten. You have eaten.
They have eaten.

252
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,650
Repeat:

253
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,460
Would that I had eaten!

254
00:35:48,429 --> 00:35:50,380
Would that you had eaten...

255
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,460
The verb "to sleep".

256
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,809
Repeat:

257
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,940
Would that I had slept!

258
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:09,179
Would that you had slept...

259
00:36:18,829 --> 00:36:20,739
The verb "to leave|

260
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,139
Repeat:

261
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,539
Would that I had left!

262
00:36:24,789 --> 00:36:26,420
Would that you had left...

263
00:36:35,429 --> 00:36:38,460
The verb "to please".
Repeat:

264
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,059
Would that I had pleased!

265
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,869
How about a gas mask?

266
00:36:57,909 --> 00:36:58,420
What?

267
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:00,780
- Someone's watching us.
- Let him.

268
00:37:00,989 --> 00:37:03,340
A big guy. Just standing there.

269
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,010
Where?

270
00:37:17,949 --> 00:37:19,380
Hide me.

271
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:20,139
What?

272
00:37:20,349 --> 00:37:21,980
Hide me!

273
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,699
Are you happy here?

274
00:37:28,469 --> 00:37:29,449
In the bathroom?

275
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,860
No, in general.

276
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:34,179
Yes. Why?

277
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:36,579
You can stay as long
as you like,

278
00:37:36,789 --> 00:37:39,659
but we have to settle things first.

279
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,260
I can pay you.

280
00:37:41,469 --> 00:37:42,449
No.

281
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,860
I'd like you
to do some hair.

282
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:48,019
Ten heads.

283
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,460
A week.

284
00:37:52,469 --> 00:37:53,019
Five.

285
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:55,659
Okay. Seven.

286
00:37:57,349 --> 00:38:00,219
Someone was looking for you.

287
00:38:00,429 --> 00:38:02,460
Not too tall. Fortyish.

288
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,699
Sad looking.

289
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:05,579
Mikolaj?

290
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,300
He brought me back
from Paris.

291
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:14,260
He was glad to know
you're alive.

292
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,340
No phone number?

293
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:19,460
No, he just said to say hi.

294
00:38:19,949 --> 00:38:21,219
Then he left.

295
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:25,030
Hi.

296
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,699
In Gdansk,
we exchange at 30.

297
00:38:42,909 --> 00:38:45,739
In Torun, twice that.
Put it in a bank

298
00:38:46,269 --> 00:38:47,019
and get a loan.

299
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:50,380
You have to turn here.

300
00:38:51,869 --> 00:38:54,219
It's up the hill.

301
00:38:56,429 --> 00:38:58,139
Only 7%.

302
00:38:59,309 --> 00:39:01,219
But if we triple the investment...

303
00:39:01,829 --> 00:39:03,300
That's pretty smart.

304
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,860
Is that clod sleeping?

305
00:39:25,909 --> 00:39:27,179
It's here.

306
00:39:28,309 --> 00:39:28,980
Hartwig and Ikea

307
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:31,300
want to build warehouses.

308
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,579
And these bumpkins

309
00:39:38,789 --> 00:39:39,820
don't know.

310
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:41,860
No one does.

311
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,059
I'm not breathing a word.

312
00:39:44,469 --> 00:39:46,059
30% profit.

313
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:52,179
We'll see.

314
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:53,300
Okay.

315
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:02,380
Don't sleep!

316
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,940
You'll get robbed.

317
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,579
Can you exchange this?

318
00:40:11,429 --> 00:40:12,539
For dollars?

319
00:40:13,309 --> 00:40:15,059
That's some nest egg.

320
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:16,809
I work.

321
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:31,019
A bottle of vodka.

322
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:33,980
The most expensive.

323
00:40:35,989 --> 00:40:37,179
Wrap it up please.

324
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:01,340
Hello.

325
00:41:04,869 --> 00:41:06,090
I'm here on business.

326
00:41:08,429 --> 00:41:09,460
Official?

327
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:12,179
No, I wanted to talk business.

328
00:41:13,989 --> 00:41:15,380
Can I come in?

329
00:41:43,429 --> 00:41:46,139
It must be a good piece of land.

330
00:41:46,349 --> 00:41:47,820
Move in with your son!

331
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:48,619
I wanted to.

332
00:41:48,829 --> 00:41:49,579
Then do it!

333
00:41:49,789 --> 00:41:52,219
Buy a car, a TV.

334
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:54,780
What for? I never watch it.

335
00:41:55,389 --> 00:41:56,820
Always the same crap.

336
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,420
Or else...

337
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:04,539
I could bury the money...

338
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,670
put it in a little jar.

339
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,019
Sure!

340
00:42:08,869 --> 00:42:10,860
That would be nice.

341
00:42:11,349 --> 00:42:12,739
1000 dollars down.

342
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:17,900
4000 more
when we close the deal.

343
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:46,420
I have to go.

344
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:47,460
What?

345
00:42:47,909 --> 00:42:49,130
It's the last train.

346
00:42:49,349 --> 00:42:51,139
You're wandering around
at night?

347
00:42:51,349 --> 00:42:54,179
You'll get mugged.
They'll steal your briefcase.

348
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:56,820
Sleep here.
There's a bed upstairs.

349
00:42:58,389 --> 00:43:00,059
It's your bed now.

350
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:03,380
Hello.

351
00:45:04,389 --> 00:45:05,579
Hello.

352
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,789
You're alive.

353
00:45:08,389 --> 00:45:10,460
They stole me with the trunk.

354
00:45:10,869 --> 00:45:12,820
Your brother told me.

355
00:45:13,269 --> 00:45:14,300
I was looking for you.

356
00:45:14,869 --> 00:45:16,260
Me too.

357
00:45:19,389 --> 00:45:20,340
Well...

358
00:45:21,909 --> 00:45:23,050
What's up?

359
00:45:27,429 --> 00:45:28,980
In the metro,
you mentioned a guy...

360
00:45:29,949 --> 00:45:31,170
Remember?

361
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:35,579
Can you get in touch with him?

362
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:37,179
Yes, I can.

363
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:41,579
When someone asks for help,
you have to help him. Right?

364
00:45:44,269 --> 00:45:45,059
Except...

365
00:45:45,269 --> 00:45:46,659
he's back in Warsaw.

366
00:45:48,909 --> 00:45:50,659
He doesn't want to anymore?

367
00:45:54,789 --> 00:45:55,820
He does.

368
00:45:56,429 --> 00:45:58,260
More than ever.

369
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:25,579
So?

370
00:47:27,389 --> 00:47:28,500
He changed his mind?

371
00:47:29,389 --> 00:47:30,449
No.

372
00:47:30,869 --> 00:47:31,929
It's me.

373
00:47:34,469 --> 00:47:36,099
Does it make a difference?

374
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:39,380
No...

375
00:47:40,829 --> 00:47:42,019
but it's you.

376
00:47:42,349 --> 00:47:42,940
How?

377
00:47:53,349 --> 00:47:54,300
These days

378
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:55,980
you can buy anything.

379
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:00,219
The envelope is in my pocket.

380
00:48:02,949 --> 00:48:04,699
Take it afterwards.

381
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:12,139
Go on.

382
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:19,659
Are you sure?

383
00:49:06,349 --> 00:49:07,900
That was a blank.

384
00:49:11,389 --> 00:49:13,300
The next one is real.

385
00:49:17,349 --> 00:49:18,300
Are you sure?

386
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:25,940
Are you sure?

387
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:34,900
Not any more.

388
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:55,019
Tell me why.

389
00:50:01,909 --> 00:50:03,130
Mikolaj,

390
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,099
we all know pain.

391
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:10,059
Yes, but...

392
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:11,860
I wanted

393
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:13,340
less of it.

394
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,219
The deal stands.

395
00:50:24,829 --> 00:50:25,340
Take it.

396
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:27,619
You've earned it.

397
00:50:31,389 --> 00:50:32,699
I did earn it.

398
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:36,539
But consider it a loan.

399
00:50:37,789 --> 00:50:39,420
How about a drink?

400
00:51:09,909 --> 00:51:12,059
I feel like a kid again!

401
00:51:14,349 --> 00:51:15,659
Me too.

402
00:51:19,869 --> 00:51:21,699
Everything is possible.

403
00:52:47,869 --> 00:52:49,380
You beat us to it.

404
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:51,059
You bought the land.

405
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:06,699
Strangle him.

406
00:53:14,869 --> 00:53:15,780
You spied!

407
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:21,019
I did.

408
00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:24,010
I have a will.

409
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:29,019
And it's airtight.

410
00:53:30,389 --> 00:53:32,690
What do you mean "airtight"?

411
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:36,260
If I die,
everything goes to the church.

412
00:53:37,909 --> 00:53:39,420
Jesus!

413
00:53:40,269 --> 00:53:41,579
To the church.

414
00:53:43,869 --> 00:53:46,219
We're screwed.
Let him go.

415
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:53,570
You're lucky
the stove's not lit.

416
00:54:04,349 --> 00:54:05,780
Let's talk.

417
00:54:14,789 --> 00:54:16,099
Are you selling?

418
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:18,539
I'm selling.

419
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:21,969
He's selling.

420
00:54:22,989 --> 00:54:23,940
How much?

421
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,110
Ten times what I paid.

422
00:54:27,309 --> 00:54:29,179
50,000 dollars.

423
00:54:35,429 --> 00:54:37,809
Excuse me while I change.

424
00:54:43,309 --> 00:54:44,699
What a low-life.

425
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:04,500
What the hell is going on?

426
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:07,260
I'll be able to pay you back.

427
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:09,260
The stove...?

428
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:15,340
Should I light the stove?

429
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:16,739
Later.

430
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:20,340
This may interest you.

431
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:22,460
I have a plot here.

432
00:55:23,349 --> 00:55:24,980
Here... and here.

433
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:26,980
Right in the middle!

434
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:28,219
Exactly.

435
00:55:28,429 --> 00:55:30,860
Here, I couldn't resist.
A beautiful spot.

436
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:32,579
With birch saplings.

437
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:34,900
Which means?

438
00:55:35,590 --> 00:55:37,699
Same thing:
10 times as much.

439
00:55:37,989 --> 00:55:40,369
I have everything:
Bills, contracts...

440
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:42,059
That's the way it is.

441
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:45,219
For the time being.

442
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:47,780
It's a deal.

443
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:51,780
You're a son of a bitch.

444
00:55:51,989 --> 00:55:53,860
No, ljust need the money.

445
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:56,630
Excuse me.
Should I light the stove?

446
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,949
Yeah, I'm cold.

447
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:02,650
Karol...

448
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:07,300
can you do Jadwiga's hair today?

449
00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:08,730
Today?

450
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:11,670
Why not? I have some time.

451
00:56:39,909 --> 00:56:41,940
Should I cut the engine, boss?

452
00:56:42,349 --> 00:56:44,500
No, keep the car warm.

453
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:57,699
Hello.

454
00:56:59,389 --> 00:57:01,019
You bought the whole store!

455
00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:02,179
Presents.

456
00:57:02,869 --> 00:57:03,820
Come in.

457
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:05,460
I'll just be a second.

458
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:09,059
I'm starting a company.

459
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:11,219
Big time.

460
00:57:12,389 --> 00:57:15,500
30% of the capital
comes from the money you gave me.

461
00:57:16,789 --> 00:57:19,780
Like it or not,
you're my partner.

462
00:57:20,349 --> 00:57:21,460
I'd like you

463
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:23,139
to run it with me.

464
00:57:23,949 --> 00:57:25,260
Serious?

465
00:57:26,349 --> 00:57:27,570
Serious.

466
00:57:30,309 --> 00:57:31,449
Volvo?

467
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:34,059
Volvo.

468
00:57:34,789 --> 00:57:35,769
Burgundy?

469
00:57:37,469 --> 00:57:39,900
Burgundy. Company car.

470
00:57:42,590 --> 00:57:44,460
Can I think it over?

471
00:57:47,789 --> 00:57:49,260
Merry Christmas.

472
00:58:20,869 --> 00:58:24,650
Ideal place for the secretary.

473
00:58:28,349 --> 00:58:30,139
Here is a second office.

474
00:58:30,349 --> 00:58:31,619
Spacious, isn't it?

475
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,110
The view is rather attractive.

476
00:58:38,789 --> 00:58:41,019
Computer and satellite hook-ups.

477
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:43,500
We need two faxes.

478
00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:45,340
Where do we plug them in?

479
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:47,849
You have three telephone lines.

480
00:58:48,909 --> 00:58:49,940
Oh, the telephone.

481
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:51,059
Yes.

482
00:58:51,309 --> 00:58:52,739
Okay, I think...

483
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:55,460
we'll take everything.

484
00:58:55,710 --> 00:58:56,769
Wonderful.

485
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:58,699
Step into my office.

486
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:00,670
Just one minute.

487
00:59:06,349 --> 00:59:07,980
Do you have a handkerchief?

488
00:59:29,829 --> 00:59:31,260
Nice.

489
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:35,260
Warsaw at our feet.

490
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:36,699
What's that?

491
00:59:36,909 --> 00:59:38,460
From the Complaint Department.

492
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:40,019
- Bananas?
- Yes.

493
00:59:40,230 --> 00:59:43,380
Cold storage!
Wait for the price to go up.

494
00:59:45,989 --> 00:59:48,659
There's a fax coming in.

495
00:59:53,309 --> 00:59:55,610
Electronic equipment.
Thailand to Russia.

496
00:59:55,829 --> 00:59:56,940
Sell it here.

497
00:59:57,150 --> 00:59:59,099
My experts say
it's good stuff.

498
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:02,900
It looks like good work.

499
01:00:05,349 --> 01:00:07,059
How thick should that wall be?

500
01:00:07,269 --> 01:00:08,820
50 centimeters.

501
01:00:09,030 --> 01:00:10,820
Measure it.

502
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:14,539
46.

503
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:17,130
Have those 4 centimeters added.

504
01:00:17,349 --> 01:00:19,260
But we'd have to knock it down!

505
01:00:19,469 --> 01:00:21,739
I guess so...
Goodbye.

506
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,150
Dominique!

507
01:01:16,510 --> 01:01:17,380
Hello?

508
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:18,380
Dominique?

509
01:01:20,789 --> 01:01:23,349
It's Karol.
I 'm calling from Warsaw.

510
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:25,820
From Poland.

511
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:34,539
I 'm sorry.
I wanted to hear your voice.

512
01:01:37,710 --> 01:01:39,380
Say something.

513
01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:43,860
Anything.

514
01:02:19,630 --> 01:02:22,860
"I hereby annul
my previous will and testament.

515
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:25,340
"I resolve that..."

516
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:28,500
That in the case of my death...

517
01:02:30,469 --> 01:02:31,690
Death.

518
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:35,500
...all my personal belongings

519
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:38,949
and property

520
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:43,579
as well as any sums...

521
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,190
of money...

522
01:02:45,559 --> 01:02:48,590
Of money in my bank accounts

523
01:02:49,519 --> 01:02:53,670
will be left
to my ex-wife, Dominique.

524
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:01,519
Dominique has a "q-u-e"
at the end.

525
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,190
I know how to spell Dominique.

526
01:03:27,559 --> 01:03:29,349
What are we doing out here?

527
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,710
I'm afraid
the office may be bugged.

528
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:34,789
By whom?

529
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:38,590
Who knows?
I wanted to tell you something.

530
01:03:40,519 --> 01:03:41,070
Go ahead.

531
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:47,789
Don't be surprised to see
my obituaries in the paper.

532
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,429
One will be signed by you.

533
01:03:52,679 --> 01:03:53,869
Okay.

534
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:59,829
My lawyer has my will.
You're the executor.

535
01:04:00,039 --> 01:04:01,750
Here are the names.

536
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:07,510
You want me to drag her
from Paris?

537
01:04:09,239 --> 01:04:09,829
Will she come?

538
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:11,630
She'll come.

539
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:13,949
It's a lot of money.

540
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:19,110
You don't want to know why?

541
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:20,190
No.

542
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:24,860
You'll need a passport again.

543
01:04:52,349 --> 01:04:54,650
Now you can have
the death certificate.

544
01:04:54,869 --> 01:04:56,780
My condolences.

545
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:11,699
Here.
Everything is in order.

546
01:05:19,389 --> 01:05:19,940
You know

547
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:21,210
what's next?

548
01:05:21,429 --> 01:05:22,019
What?

549
01:05:26,519 --> 01:05:27,349
We need someone

550
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:28,579
to bury.

551
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,190
A corpse?

552
01:05:31,710 --> 01:05:33,059
You don't plan on...?

553
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:35,179
No.

554
01:05:37,030 --> 01:05:38,900
We'll buy one.
These days...

555
01:05:39,349 --> 01:05:40,860
you can buy anything.

556
01:05:41,079 --> 01:05:41,710
You think so?

557
01:05:43,030 --> 01:05:46,460
Would you mind
a Russian import, boss?

558
01:06:04,429 --> 01:06:05,300
Thank you.

559
01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:06,650
Thank you.

560
01:06:07,710 --> 01:06:08,849
Let's go.

561
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:24,739
It couldn't be better, boss.

562
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:27,980
He's impossible to identify.

563
01:06:29,269 --> 01:06:29,940
What happened?

564
01:06:30,670 --> 01:06:32,460
His head got crushed.

565
01:06:32,869 --> 01:06:33,980
He leaned too far

566
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:35,300
out a train window.

567
01:06:37,389 --> 01:06:38,699
Let's close it.

568
01:06:48,829 --> 01:06:49,579
I'll manage.

569
01:06:50,429 --> 01:06:53,739
Okay. Goodnight, boss.

570
01:06:54,590 --> 01:06:56,059
I'll close up.

571
01:07:32,030 --> 01:07:33,219
You scared me.

572
01:07:33,429 --> 01:07:35,579
Why?
You knew I was coming.

573
01:07:35,789 --> 01:07:37,059
I don't know...

574
01:07:37,590 --> 01:07:39,780
Afraid of what will happen?

575
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:45,139
Here's your passport.

576
01:07:45,590 --> 01:07:48,019
Your ticket to Hong Kong.

577
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:50,900
Your address.
I rented you a nice house.

578
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:55,059
Are you sure?

579
01:08:00,909 --> 01:08:02,820
Don't be late for the plane.

580
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:05,940
At 10 o'clock,
I'll call the police.

581
01:08:06,309 --> 01:08:09,219
They'll be there
a half hour later.

582
01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:10,690
At 10:30,

583
01:08:10,909 --> 01:08:12,420
you'll be in the air.

584
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:14,460
Easy, isn't it?

585
01:08:14,829 --> 01:08:16,180
Easy.

586
01:08:20,670 --> 01:08:21,460
Mikolaj...

587
01:08:21,670 --> 01:08:22,890
So long.

588
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,430
I wanted you to come.

589
01:10:58,479 --> 01:10:59,539
I wanted to be sure.

590
01:11:01,159 --> 01:11:03,750
I didn 't want to have
to ask anymore.

591
01:11:05,029 --> 01:11:06,170
Karol...

592
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:11,670
You cried at my funeral.

593
01:11:13,359 --> 01:11:14,500
Why?

594
01:11:16,279 --> 01:11:17,750
Because you were dead.

595
01:11:23,039 --> 01:11:24,670
Can I touch your hand?

596
01:11:37,279 --> 01:11:38,590
Sit down.

597
01:11:45,439 --> 01:11:47,189
Can I lay my head here?

598
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:03,260
I've wanted to lay my head here
for such a long time.

599
01:13:26,359 --> 01:13:28,590
You moaned louder
than on the phone.

600
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:30,430
Yes.

601
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:37,550
You won't look at me?

602
01:15:19,279 --> 01:15:20,390
Karol?

603
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:53,829
Mikolaj, please.
It's Dominique.

604
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,670
It's Dominique.
Where's Karol?

605
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:00,390
He's dead.

606
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:01,819
He is not. I saw him...

607
01:16:02,039 --> 01:16:03,989
You were at his funeral.

608
01:16:04,470 --> 01:16:07,380
I was not at his funeral.
He's alive.

609
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:08,710
I'm sorry...

610
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:11,909
You have to help me find him.

611
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:13,470
I love him.

612
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:18,229
Of course. It's row 23.
Tomb 10675.

613
01:16:18,439 --> 01:16:21,510
The name of the cemetery
is Powazkowski.

614
01:16:23,159 --> 01:16:24,270
He's back!

615
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:25,350
I think I doubt that.

616
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,470
I have to hang up.

617
01:16:32,359 --> 01:16:33,270
Dominique Vidal?

618
01:16:33,479 --> 01:16:34,270
Yes?

619
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,060
Police.

620
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:38,789
Passport, please.

621
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,510
It's at the front desk.

622
01:16:42,399 --> 01:16:43,539
Call downstairs.

623
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,390
We have a search warrant.

624
01:16:58,590 --> 01:16:59,979
Can I get dressed?

625
01:17:01,439 --> 01:17:03,109
I 'm a French citizen.

626
01:17:06,439 --> 01:17:08,029
Someone from the consulate
is coming.

627
01:17:11,069 --> 01:17:12,699
You have the right
to remain silent

628
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:13,949
until he comes.

629
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:15,350
I have nothing to hide.

630
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:18,109
What do you want from me?

631
01:17:23,550 --> 01:17:26,300
Have you begun executing the will?

632
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:27,550
Yes. So?

633
01:17:31,159 --> 01:17:33,270
Your ex-husband was wealthy.

634
01:17:33,479 --> 01:17:34,270
Yes.

635
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:40,140
That's all, thank you.

636
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:55,180
We don 't believe your husband died
a natural death.

637
01:17:55,789 --> 01:17:56,899
What?

638
01:17:59,510 --> 01:18:01,140
He was helped.

639
01:18:07,590 --> 01:18:10,380
We have proof you were here
"the day he died.

640
01:18:13,229 --> 01:18:15,460
The stamp is in your passport.

641
01:18:16,029 --> 01:18:16,779
How is that?

642
01:18:16,989 --> 01:18:19,060
He's not dead. He's alive.

643
01:18:20,550 --> 01:18:21,220
Who?

644
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:22,489
My husband.

645
01:18:29,149 --> 01:18:32,340
Who was buried yesterday
at 11:30?

646
01:18:33,949 --> 01:18:35,090
Him.

647
01:18:37,510 --> 01:18:39,140
So who's alive?

648
01:18:42,869 --> 01:18:43,979
No one.

649
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:51,060
Hello. I 'm Monsieur Le Gac
from the consulate.

650
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,829
What's new?

651
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:28,149
Don't stand in the window.

652
01:20:28,350 --> 01:20:30,420
Someone will see you.

653
01:20:32,710 --> 01:20:34,020
It's ready.

654
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:44,579
What?

655
01:20:45,710 --> 01:20:50,539
I remember identifying you
after the exhumation.

656
01:20:50,949 --> 01:20:52,779
Boy, did we identify you!

657
01:20:53,149 --> 01:20:55,060
Mikolaj puked.

658
01:20:56,149 --> 01:20:59,420
Good thing you didn't
turn yourself in. We'd be in jail.

659
01:20:59,630 --> 01:21:03,899
You, me, Mikolaj, the driver
and some others.

660
01:21:07,390 --> 01:21:11,140
I made some cherryjam.
Do you want it?

661
01:21:13,470 --> 01:21:16,460
Someday I'll cook the snails
in the garden.

662
01:21:17,109 --> 01:21:18,300
I'll make a stew.

663
01:21:20,550 --> 01:21:21,220
The lawyer?

664
01:21:21,949 --> 01:21:24,859
He came by. He's expensive.

665
01:21:25,229 --> 01:21:26,369
He said...

666
01:21:31,189 --> 01:21:32,220
What?

667
01:21:35,149 --> 01:21:38,850
That he sees a little light
at the end of the tunnel.
