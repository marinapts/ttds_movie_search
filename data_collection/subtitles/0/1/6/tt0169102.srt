1
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:36,043
The year is 1893.

2
00:04:36,261 --> 00:04:37,913
Champaner.

3
00:04:38,652 --> 00:04:43,130
A small village in
the heart of India.

4
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:49,609
The people of Champaner
depended on agriculture...

5
00:04:49,826 --> 00:04:52,739
...like those in
thousands of villages.

6
00:04:54,782 --> 00:04:59,696
A British cantonment
bordered the village.

7
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:06,218
Two miles south, beyond
the cantonment, was the fort...

8
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:09,435
...of the Rajah
of this province.

9
00:05:09,696 --> 00:05:14,000
The British protected the Rajah's
domain from neighbouring attacks.

10
00:05:14,262 --> 00:05:19,217
They also promised the other Rajahs
protection from this Rajah.

11
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:22,782
Thanks to this double-dealing,
the British...

12
00:05:22,957 --> 00:05:26,652
...collected a tax from the Rajahs...

13
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:29,261
...paid by every farmer
in the country.

14
00:05:31,348 --> 00:05:33,174
Lagaan:

15
00:05:34,305 --> 00:05:38,609
The submission of a portion
of the farmer's harvest...

16
00:05:38,869 --> 00:05:41,000
...to the Rajah as tax.

17
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,391
Every Rajah collected lagaan from
villages under his rule.

18
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,826
The Rajah would keep one share...

19
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:56,347
...and give the rest to the British.

20
00:05:57,435 --> 00:06:01,609
In this way, the British fist
grew iron strong.

21
00:06:02,044 --> 00:06:05,304
Like thousands of villages
across the country...

22
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:09,000
...the farmers of Champaner
toiled on empty bellies...

23
00:06:09,217 --> 00:06:12,392
...and paid taxes to the Rajah
every year.

24
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:20,913
Last year it rained,
but very little.

25
00:06:21,435 --> 00:06:25,565
And this year, there has been
no rain so far.

26
00:06:28,826 --> 00:06:31,131
Dry eyes...

27
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,870
...scan the sky.

28
00:06:51,652 --> 00:06:55,260
You're there again!
What are you looking at, Mother?

29
00:06:57,869 --> 00:07:02,000
Just wondering when the sky
will darken with clouds.

30
00:07:02,305 --> 00:07:04,521
How I long for the rains.

31
00:07:04,696 --> 00:07:09,087
A month of rainy season gone by
and not a drop of rain.

32
00:07:10,652 --> 00:07:12,217
Coming, coming.

33
00:07:13,652 --> 00:07:17,696
By God's grace,
at least we have drinking water.

34
00:07:17,957 --> 00:07:20,566
Or we'd be parched to the bone.

35
00:07:21,261 --> 00:07:23,783
- Such are his ways.
- Yes, Mother.

36
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,087
The fields are parched.
How will the grains ripen?

37
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:30,652
Don't lose heart, Hari Bhai.

38
00:07:31,391 --> 00:07:34,783
We'll dig into the earth.

39
00:07:35,044 --> 00:07:37,478
We'll tear up the earth for water.

40
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,783
It's what I told Bhuvan.

41
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,826
Where is he?

42
00:07:42,304 --> 00:07:44,522
He went out in the morning.

43
00:07:45,348 --> 00:07:48,696
It's time to eat.
Send him home if you see him.

44
00:07:48,956 --> 00:07:50,173
Yes, Mother.

45
00:07:51,695 --> 00:07:54,174
You pests!
I'll wring your necks!

46
00:07:55,044 --> 00:07:58,392
Oh, no!
The Great Chicken War again.

47
00:07:58,609 --> 00:08:01,043
Goli, you moron!

48
00:08:01,304 --> 00:08:04,522
See if I don't ram you
down a gun barrel!

49
00:08:04,739 --> 00:08:07,652
Morons!
You think these are your own hens!

50
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,522
Go to hell, Bhura!

51
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,913
Come here, I'll show you.

52
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,521
- Wait right there!
- Come on!

53
00:08:15,739 --> 00:08:19,695
- I'll put you in bed for days!
- How dare you hit my kids?

54
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,914
I'll hang them
and burn chilies under them.

55
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:25,522
Hassling my hens!
And you?!

56
00:08:25,783 --> 00:08:29,130
You behave or else
I'll burn your slingshot!

57
00:08:29,348 --> 00:08:31,218
- Is that so?
- Stop it now.

58
00:08:31,434 --> 00:08:35,174
You two are worse
than cats and dogs.

59
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:37,740
But his boys are after my hens!

60
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,826
Stop acting like
they're being molested!

61
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,565
Your hens aren't getting married!

62
00:08:43,826 --> 00:08:47,522
They're only kids.
Goli, control your kids.

63
00:08:47,782 --> 00:08:50,000
Tell me, have you seen Bhuvan?

64
00:08:50,261 --> 00:08:53,087
- No. You seen him, Bhura?
- No!

65
00:08:53,347 --> 00:08:54,782
Why?

66
00:09:01,696 --> 00:09:03,565
Left, right, left!

67
00:09:29,348 --> 00:09:33,479
Scumbags!
Sons of jackals!

68
00:09:34,696 --> 00:09:36,956
Strutting around in the heat!

69
00:09:37,435 --> 00:09:40,479
You're all going back
to that little island...

70
00:09:40,739 --> 00:09:42,174
...whimpering!

71
00:09:42,434 --> 00:09:45,435
May the mighty hands of Fate
ruin you!

72
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:48,913
Guran! Why bother
reading their fortune?

73
00:09:49,174 --> 00:09:53,392
They won't even care.
Won't you read my fortune?

74
00:10:00,783 --> 00:10:04,348
Tell me. Will I get the prince
of my dreams?

75
00:10:04,565 --> 00:10:05,739
Why not?

76
00:10:05,913 --> 00:10:08,914
If you truly love him,
then he'll give you...

77
00:10:09,087 --> 00:10:12,565
...your wedding bangle.
You'll be his bride.

78
00:10:12,827 --> 00:10:16,131
- Really? You heard that, Jigni?
- Yes.

79
00:10:16,347 --> 00:10:17,391
But...

80
00:10:18,305 --> 00:10:20,260
But...
But what?

81
00:10:20,522 --> 00:10:22,391
I see an obstacle.

82
00:10:22,653 --> 00:10:24,914
What obstacle?
Tell me quickly.

83
00:10:25,174 --> 00:10:26,912
Gauri!

84
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,434
Later.

85
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:30,131
Read my fortune.

86
00:10:30,565 --> 00:10:31,869
What is it, Kaka?

87
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,696
- Was Guran telling your fortune?
- No.

88
00:10:34,956 --> 00:10:36,956
- Yes.
- He's mad.

89
00:10:37,174 --> 00:10:41,260
No clue about the present
and he babbles about the future!

90
00:10:41,522 --> 00:10:43,869
No, Hari Kaka.
He's not mad.

91
00:10:44,131 --> 00:10:45,739
What about Durga Bhabi?

92
00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:50,696
She was childless for nine years.
Then Guran said she'd have a son.

93
00:10:50,913 --> 00:10:53,347
And wasn't Somu born?
What about...?

94
00:10:53,609 --> 00:10:57,739
All right, all right.
That lunatic is not mad.

95
00:10:58,217 --> 00:11:01,566
Now tell me.
Have you seen Bhuvan?

96
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:04,478
No, but I know where he will be.

97
00:11:04,696 --> 00:11:06,608
Amazing!

98
00:11:06,869 --> 00:11:09,740
So our little girl keeps tabs
on him?

99
00:11:09,913 --> 00:11:11,608
Lakha, what is it to you?

100
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:17,000
I see! This concerns me
and I'm not to open my mouth?

101
00:11:17,914 --> 00:11:20,870
Why don't you wear
wedding bangles for me?

102
00:11:21,131 --> 00:11:24,652
- Lakha, what nonsense is this?!
- I really mean it.

103
00:11:24,869 --> 00:11:26,826
You've grown old...

104
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:30,392
...and Gauri here
doesn't care for me.

105
00:11:30,652 --> 00:11:33,521
Here, look at this. Look.

106
00:11:33,782 --> 00:11:36,087
- See how badly hurt I am.
- Hurt?

107
00:11:37,913 --> 00:11:40,957
It's my father you need, not me.

108
00:11:41,174 --> 00:11:43,087
- Father!
- What is it?

109
00:11:43,348 --> 00:11:46,174
Lakha has a gash on his hand.

110
00:11:47,304 --> 00:11:51,479
He seems to cut his hand
more than he cuts wood.

111
00:11:51,696 --> 00:11:55,956
What can I do, Isar Chacha?!
I'm always wounding myself...

112
00:11:56,218 --> 00:11:57,522
...very badly.

113
00:11:58,913 --> 00:12:02,435
Kaka, I'll go fetch Bhuvan.

114
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:07,131
Listen, if you see him,
tell him Mother is waiting for him.

115
00:12:07,304 --> 00:12:08,783
Yes, I'll tell him.

116
00:12:52,348 --> 00:12:53,913
One.

117
00:12:55,478 --> 00:12:57,044
Two.

118
00:12:57,695 --> 00:12:58,912
Three.

119
00:13:00,174 --> 00:13:01,218
Missed again.

120
00:13:01,478 --> 00:13:03,957
Ram Singh!
Quick! From there.

121
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:08,000
Wesson, you go round.
Let's corner the blasted animal!

122
00:13:50,608 --> 00:13:52,087
One...

123
00:13:55,174 --> 00:13:56,739
Drop the stone.

124
00:14:03,652 --> 00:14:06,478
Finally. Got the darn creature.

125
00:14:06,696 --> 00:14:08,913
Well done, sahib.
Good shot.

126
00:14:09,087 --> 00:14:10,609
Thank you, Ram Singh.

127
00:14:10,913 --> 00:14:13,130
Now for something bigger.

128
00:14:15,435 --> 00:14:17,130
Arrest him.

129
00:14:17,391 --> 00:14:21,000
Sir, this dacoit
was hiding in the bushes...

130
00:14:21,174 --> 00:14:22,956
...with this stone.

131
00:14:23,174 --> 00:14:25,479
He'd been distracting the deer.

132
00:14:29,348 --> 00:14:31,087
Now I understand...

133
00:14:32,782 --> 00:14:37,131
...why I missed five times.

134
00:14:38,608 --> 00:14:42,521
You, a protector of animals, eh?

135
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:44,957
He's a farmer from Champaner.

136
00:14:45,435 --> 00:14:49,348
Well, you must be a very good runner.

137
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,913
Try saving this one.

138
00:15:18,304 --> 00:15:20,956
Next time, I will shoot you.

139
00:15:23,174 --> 00:15:25,435
Next time, you'll be the target.

140
00:15:29,044 --> 00:15:31,826
Captain Russell!
Rajah Puran Singh...

141
00:15:32,044 --> 00:15:34,261
...is waiting for you.

142
00:15:34,522 --> 00:15:37,782
Puran Singh!
What could he want now?

143
00:16:02,217 --> 00:16:04,392
Bhuvan!

144
00:16:09,782 --> 00:16:12,173
Bhuvan!

145
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:18,217
Bhuvan!

146
00:16:23,912 --> 00:16:26,653
Why are you screaming
your head off?

147
00:16:26,826 --> 00:16:29,913
I was looking for you.
I couldn't see you.

148
00:16:30,131 --> 00:16:33,653
- Was I lying dead somewhere?
- How should I know?

149
00:16:33,913 --> 00:16:35,914
God! What am I saying?

150
00:16:36,565 --> 00:16:39,043
Why are you so angry?

151
00:16:40,522 --> 00:16:43,652
Never mind.
What do you want?

152
00:16:43,913 --> 00:16:47,608
- I've got something to tell you.
- What?

153
00:16:47,913 --> 00:16:49,869
Sit down, won't you?

154
00:16:51,957 --> 00:16:53,218
So tell me.

155
00:16:53,869 --> 00:16:57,652
Guran read my fortune today.

156
00:16:57,913 --> 00:16:59,956
What's the misfortune?

157
00:17:00,218 --> 00:17:03,260
So mean!
I'm not telling you then.

158
00:17:03,521 --> 00:17:05,305
All right, tell me.

159
00:17:05,783 --> 00:17:07,174
Come on.

160
00:17:10,783 --> 00:17:12,956
Guran said...

161
00:17:13,217 --> 00:17:17,739
...I'll put henna on my hands
this year.

162
00:17:18,001 --> 00:17:20,347
I mean, get married.

163
00:17:21,478 --> 00:17:23,304
Wow!

164
00:17:23,566 --> 00:17:25,479
That's great news.

165
00:17:25,696 --> 00:17:29,087
You'll be dancing with joy.
Who's the boy?

166
00:17:32,565 --> 00:17:34,522
How would I know?

167
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,652
Guran didn't tell me that.

168
00:17:38,783 --> 00:17:40,826
But one thing is certain:

169
00:17:41,044 --> 00:17:44,652
The house I marry into will have...

170
00:17:44,869 --> 00:17:47,000
...a neem tree in the courtyard.

171
00:17:47,305 --> 00:17:51,000
A big field beside the house...

172
00:17:51,609 --> 00:17:54,565
...two cows, a pair of oxen...

173
00:17:55,304 --> 00:17:57,217
...and three goats.

174
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:01,087
Guran said my home will be...

175
00:18:01,348 --> 00:18:03,608
...a little heaven.

176
00:18:09,218 --> 00:18:12,565
How wonderful!
You're really lucky.

177
00:18:12,783 --> 00:18:16,348
Lucky?
You call this lucky?

178
00:18:16,566 --> 00:18:19,130
Heaven for a home.
What more do you want?

179
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:22,044
Lord knows what'll become of me.

180
00:18:22,956 --> 00:18:25,609
Tell me one thing, Bhuvan.

181
00:18:25,782 --> 00:18:28,956
- What kind of girl do you like?
- Me?

182
00:18:32,086 --> 00:18:36,261
I will only like the girl
whom my mother likes.

183
00:18:37,696 --> 00:18:39,782
- Whom Mother likes?
- Yes.

184
00:18:40,174 --> 00:18:42,261
- Oh, God!
- What happened?

185
00:18:43,087 --> 00:18:45,913
I came to tell you that...

186
00:18:46,434 --> 00:18:48,304
...Mother wants to see you.

187
00:18:48,522 --> 00:18:51,000
Now you tell me!
After all this!

188
00:18:51,261 --> 00:18:53,304
You sit here. I'm going.

189
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,261
Bhuvan, I'm sorry.

190
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,782
Rajahji.

191
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,391
How did your hunt go?

192
00:19:19,608 --> 00:19:23,391
The British are the best
when it comes to hunting.

193
00:19:23,652 --> 00:19:27,782
- The British Empire is the best, right?
- Absolutely.

194
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,044
- But I'm worried.
- About what?

195
00:19:31,261 --> 00:19:33,608
When all the game is finished...

196
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:37,087
...whom will your guns target next?

197
00:19:38,435 --> 00:19:41,304
We're fortunate that you came
to visit us.

198
00:19:41,565 --> 00:19:43,782
But I don't know the reason.

199
00:19:44,043 --> 00:19:48,348
I've brought a request on behalf
of my subjects.

200
00:19:48,565 --> 00:19:50,044
A request?

201
00:19:50,261 --> 00:19:51,478
Morning, Eliza.

202
00:19:51,696 --> 00:19:55,434
Your Highness, I present to you
my sister Elizabeth.

203
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:57,782
She just arrived from London.

204
00:19:58,043 --> 00:20:02,043
Elizabeth, His Highness Puran Singh
Chawla of Champaner.

205
00:20:02,304 --> 00:20:05,043
It is my good fortune to meet you.

206
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:08,522
- Rajahji, she doesn't know Hindi.
- Of course.

207
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,870
Charmed to meet you.

208
00:20:11,522 --> 00:20:13,174
Pleased to meet you.

209
00:20:13,434 --> 00:20:15,347
- Sir.
- At ease, Smith.

210
00:20:15,565 --> 00:20:16,391
Rajahji.

211
00:20:16,609 --> 00:20:19,956
Elizabeth, meet my deputy,
Lt. Patrick Smith.

212
00:20:20,217 --> 00:20:22,957
- How do you do?
- Pleased to meet you.

213
00:20:23,173 --> 00:20:24,435
Gentlemen.

214
00:20:27,739 --> 00:20:30,348
Well, Rajahji, I am at your service.

215
00:20:31,304 --> 00:20:35,260
For the last three years,
my people haven't worshipped...

216
00:20:35,522 --> 00:20:37,609
...at the Siddheshwar Temple.

217
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,782
They believe that...

218
00:20:40,044 --> 00:20:44,435
...worshipping there will end
the hardships they faced last year.

219
00:20:44,696 --> 00:20:48,348
- But...
- But the temple is in the land...

220
00:20:48,522 --> 00:20:52,435
...ruled by Rajah Diler Singh,
your cousin and your enemy.

221
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:56,305
And your dear friend.

222
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm sure if you speak to Diler Singh,
he won't say no.

223
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,739
No, thank you.
Hum shakahari hai.

224
00:21:06,001 --> 00:21:07,696
I mean, vegetarian.

225
00:21:10,174 --> 00:21:14,087
What do you think, Captain Russell?
Is it possible?

226
00:21:14,826 --> 00:21:17,174
Well, he could be persuaded.

227
00:21:17,435 --> 00:21:19,870
Your work might be done.

228
00:21:21,826 --> 00:21:23,783
But on one condition.

229
00:21:23,999 --> 00:21:25,957
There's one condition.

230
00:21:26,217 --> 00:21:28,130
Condition?

231
00:21:28,391 --> 00:21:30,000
Yes, tell me.

232
00:21:31,087 --> 00:21:33,000
Eat the meat, Your Highness.

233
00:21:37,913 --> 00:21:42,000
You eat this meat
and I'll talk to Diler Singh.

234
00:21:43,739 --> 00:21:48,218
As I told you, I'm a vegetarian.

235
00:21:48,478 --> 00:21:51,087
Hum shakahari hai.

236
00:21:51,305 --> 00:21:53,869
Just one piece of meat.

237
00:21:54,131 --> 00:21:57,304
You eat it and consider your job done.

238
00:22:00,348 --> 00:22:02,000
Andrew.

239
00:22:04,261 --> 00:22:06,174
Eat the meat.

240
00:22:11,348 --> 00:22:15,739
How's my eating meat
connected to the temple?

241
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,565
It's not connected.

242
00:22:17,826 --> 00:22:21,435
I just want to see you eating meat.

243
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,305
Captain Russell...

244
00:22:24,435 --> 00:22:27,434
...l cannot betray my religion...

245
00:22:27,696 --> 00:22:30,565
...in order to do my duty.

246
00:22:33,261 --> 00:22:34,957
I'm sorry.

247
00:22:36,652 --> 00:22:40,261
All right then.
You'll have to pay me double tax.

248
00:22:41,088 --> 00:22:42,217
Double lagaan?

249
00:22:42,826 --> 00:22:44,522
Look, Rajahji.

250
00:22:44,783 --> 00:22:49,565
Last year, I agreed to cut the tax
by half at your request.

251
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,826
And delayed, at that.

252
00:22:52,044 --> 00:22:56,217
You have to clear the arrears
this year.

253
00:22:56,435 --> 00:22:57,652
So...

254
00:22:57,869 --> 00:23:00,348
-...double lagaan.
- Sir.

255
00:23:02,869 --> 00:23:05,653
But it hasn't rained yet.

256
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:10,392
The British Raj does not bathe
in India's rains, Rajahji.

257
00:23:10,652 --> 00:23:15,479
Rain or no rain,
I must maintain this cantonment.

258
00:23:15,739 --> 00:23:17,870
The army costs money.

259
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,912
It has to be paid, fed and clothed...

260
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:24,347
...for your protection.

261
00:23:26,174 --> 00:23:28,608
How will the farmers pay?

262
00:23:28,913 --> 00:23:33,347
Come on, Rajahji.
It's only double lagaan.

263
00:23:33,695 --> 00:23:35,826
And moreover...

264
00:23:36,043 --> 00:23:38,739
...you don't even eat meat.

265
00:24:10,131 --> 00:24:13,391
Hey, Arjan!
What's Bagha so thrilled about?

266
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:16,696
- I don't know.
- Must be something special.

267
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:21,435
Hey, Bagha!
What are you beating that drum for?

268
00:25:00,739 --> 00:25:02,130
Clouds!

269
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,783
Dark and dense

270
00:25:14,435 --> 00:25:17,609
Dark and dense
Come the swirling clouds

271
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:20,261
Dark and dense
Roar the clouds

272
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:22,957
The thunder reverberates

273
00:25:23,174 --> 00:25:25,826
How lethally does lightning flash

274
00:25:26,087 --> 00:25:29,869
The clouds make my heart race

275
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:33,609
The clouds make my heart race

276
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:43,000
O black cloud
Pour down your rain

277
00:25:46,305 --> 00:25:51,478
O black cloud
Pour down your rain

278
00:25:54,434 --> 00:25:57,173
Wield not
Lightning's flashy sword

279
00:25:57,391 --> 00:26:00,044
But instead
The arrows of raindrops

280
00:26:02,869 --> 00:26:05,740
The clouds
Bring rain in their wake

281
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,478
Swirling darkly
The clouds come

282
00:26:12,044 --> 00:26:14,565
My heart leaps and says.:

283
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:17,001
Dance with joy

284
00:26:17,565 --> 00:26:19,913
Step out of the house

285
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:24,434
The clouds will rain down nectar

286
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:34,696
Gone are the days of hardship
Sing the melodies of the monsoon

287
00:26:35,435 --> 00:26:37,478
Dark and dense
The swirling clouds

288
00:26:37,738 --> 00:26:40,739
Dark and dense
Roar the spreading clouds

289
00:27:15,609 --> 00:27:17,913
When joyous rain pours

290
00:27:18,175 --> 00:27:20,783
Who then will be thirsty?

291
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,478
The cuckoo will sing
Perched on the parapet

292
00:27:26,609 --> 00:27:28,956
The songbirds will sing

293
00:27:29,609 --> 00:27:32,000
Of the new days
That are to come

294
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:35,304
Light shall smile at darkness

295
00:27:37,217 --> 00:27:40,044
Love's rain
Will drench hearts and bodies

296
00:27:40,304 --> 00:27:43,304
On the earth
A mirror of water

297
00:27:46,174 --> 00:27:48,218
Wherever you go

298
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:51,435
You will see

299
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,174
This splendid sight

300
00:27:53,435 --> 00:27:57,173
The earth here
Wears a rainbow-hued veil

301
00:28:21,261 --> 00:28:26,391
Let's hang swings from trees
And swing high

302
00:28:29,826 --> 00:28:34,521
O black cloud
Pour down rain

303
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:40,827
Wield not
Lightning's flashy sword

304
00:28:41,043 --> 00:28:44,392
But instead
The arrows of raindrops

305
00:29:17,609 --> 00:29:20,218
Now comes the intoxicating season

306
00:29:20,435 --> 00:29:23,000
To spread a carpet of green

307
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:27,783
Bring along the season of rain

308
00:29:28,479 --> 00:29:31,131
Anklets of lightning
Adorn her feet

309
00:29:31,391 --> 00:29:33,913
The cloud is her veil

310
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:39,174
The season comes to bedeck
The bridal earth

311
00:29:39,608 --> 00:29:41,913
Boughs wear
Bracelets of blossoms

312
00:29:42,174 --> 00:29:45,261
Joy will now rain
Upon every courtyard

313
00:29:48,348 --> 00:29:50,913
Now every bud will bloom

314
00:29:51,174 --> 00:29:53,740
Every path will ring with laughter

315
00:29:53,956 --> 00:29:56,522
The breeze makes the season balmy

316
00:29:56,782 --> 00:30:00,870
Doused is the scorching heat
That burns body and soul

317
00:30:06,087 --> 00:30:11,260
O black cloud
Pour down your rain

318
00:30:14,478 --> 00:30:17,566
Wield not
Lightning's flashy sword

319
00:30:17,826 --> 00:30:20,435
But instead
The arrows of raindrops

320
00:30:22,783 --> 00:30:25,348
Dark and dense
The swirling clouds

321
00:30:25,608 --> 00:30:28,827
Dark and dense
Roar the spreading clouds

322
00:30:29,043 --> 00:30:31,043
The thunder reverberates

323
00:30:31,218 --> 00:30:33,870
Oh, look!
How lethally does lightning flash

324
00:30:58,131 --> 00:30:59,478
Oh, God!

325
00:31:00,826 --> 00:31:03,043
We celebrated too soon.

326
00:31:03,522 --> 00:31:06,391
Who knows what God
is punishing us for?

327
00:31:06,653 --> 00:31:09,478
There'll be no rain this year too.

328
00:31:09,695 --> 00:31:12,043
Bloody lunatic!
Lunatic!

329
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:15,521
- Always saying inauspicious things!
- Wretch!

330
00:31:32,956 --> 00:31:36,130
Listen, villagers,
to this proclamation!

331
00:31:36,348 --> 00:31:40,174
Orders of Rajah Puran Singh,
your liege and master.

332
00:31:40,434 --> 00:31:43,608
This year you shall pay
twice the amount...

333
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:46,217
...of wheat, rice and maize.

334
00:31:46,478 --> 00:31:49,957
The double lagaan
will apply to the whole province.

335
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:53,131
- How can this be possible?
- This is tyranny!

336
00:31:56,696 --> 00:31:58,652
Double lagaan!

337
00:31:59,956 --> 00:32:03,043
Demon! Why don't you just
skin us alive?!

338
00:32:03,218 --> 00:32:07,870
Our plight isn't hidden from the Rajah!
Even then, double lagaan!

339
00:32:12,913 --> 00:32:16,261
What have we done wrong?
Why double lagaan?

340
00:32:16,522 --> 00:32:20,435
We didn't pay on time last year.
And we paid only half.

341
00:32:20,696 --> 00:32:24,914
Abba, it was Rajahji who waived it
because it didn't rain.

342
00:32:25,783 --> 00:32:28,652
Sweets one year and abuse the next.

343
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:31,566
We're being punished for it now!

344
00:32:31,826 --> 00:32:33,088
Quiet, Lakha!

345
00:32:33,348 --> 00:32:36,608
I won't hear one word
against our Rajahji.

346
00:32:36,869 --> 00:32:40,043
He and his ancestors have protected us.

347
00:32:40,304 --> 00:32:43,044
So? Was that any favour?

348
00:32:43,305 --> 00:32:46,174
It is the duty of a tree to shelter.

349
00:32:46,478 --> 00:32:48,478
All I want to know is...

350
00:32:48,695 --> 00:32:52,000
...for how long will we
fill his coffers?

351
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:54,087
Try and understand, Arjan.

352
00:32:54,348 --> 00:32:59,305
This demand is the doing
of those damn white sahibs!

353
00:32:59,565 --> 00:33:03,088
Whether we put it into
the right hand or the left...

354
00:33:03,261 --> 00:33:05,522
...it is still we who pay.

355
00:33:06,653 --> 00:33:11,478
I say we all go to the palace
and talk to him.

356
00:33:11,652 --> 00:33:13,696
He's seen these clouds too.

357
00:33:13,913 --> 00:33:16,740
We'll say we cannot pay lagaan.

358
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,913
Not a single grain.

359
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:24,566
What if Rajahji refuses
even after hearing us?

360
00:33:25,478 --> 00:33:28,913
Then the fingers of my hand
will close into a fist.

361
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:31,739
Meaning? You'll fight?

362
00:33:31,999 --> 00:33:36,217
- If it's necessary, then I will.
- Have you lost your mind?

363
00:33:36,522 --> 00:33:40,173
If you offend Rajahji,
we'll all be ruined!

364
00:33:40,391 --> 00:33:43,739
Is your life all joy
and comfort right now?

365
00:33:43,956 --> 00:33:46,957
I won't let the whole village
come to harm!

366
00:33:47,218 --> 00:33:48,956
What should we do?

367
00:33:49,434 --> 00:33:52,174
Sell our homes?
Our cattle? Ourselves?

368
00:33:52,435 --> 00:33:55,783
What justice is it
to demand double lagaan?

369
00:34:09,304 --> 00:34:11,870
Pitch it up a bit.

370
00:34:17,087 --> 00:34:18,130
Running!

371
00:34:19,043 --> 00:34:21,043
Chief, there he is!

372
00:34:24,348 --> 00:34:25,826
Where are you going?

373
00:34:26,043 --> 00:34:29,826
Please. We must meet His Highness.
It is most urgent.

374
00:34:30,087 --> 00:34:32,174
But the game is going on.

375
00:34:32,392 --> 00:34:36,478
Sit here. You must wait
until the game is over.

376
00:34:36,696 --> 00:34:39,174
All of you, sit down.

377
00:34:46,304 --> 00:34:48,347
What are they playing?

378
00:34:49,478 --> 00:34:52,739
God knows what these white guys
are playing.

379
00:34:55,217 --> 00:34:58,348
It's quite like our game of
gilli-danda.

380
00:34:59,826 --> 00:35:03,783
Why are they playing
a kid's game then?

381
00:35:06,044 --> 00:35:08,565
Run it! Run it!

382
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:11,826
How's that?

383
00:35:12,088 --> 00:35:13,565
Yardley!

384
00:35:15,435 --> 00:35:17,566
Any clouds up there?

385
00:35:24,261 --> 00:35:25,740
Great shot!

386
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,609
Wasn't that a wonderful shot?

387
00:35:39,652 --> 00:35:43,174
You are not supposed to
touch the ball!

388
00:35:57,044 --> 00:35:59,435
Bloody darkie!
Arrest him!

389
00:36:05,348 --> 00:36:07,218
Long live Your Highness!

390
00:36:07,609 --> 00:36:09,913
What are you all doing here?

391
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:11,435
Forgive us.

392
00:36:11,695 --> 00:36:15,478
We came to see you,
not to see their stupid game.

393
00:36:15,696 --> 00:36:18,783
We are desperate here
and now he hits Bhura!

394
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,608
- Captain Russell...
- I didn't hear what you just said.

395
00:36:23,086 --> 00:36:24,435
Forgive them.

396
00:36:24,653 --> 00:36:27,522
They've come to me with their problems.

397
00:36:27,783 --> 00:36:30,000
The boy is an innocent anyway.

398
00:36:30,609 --> 00:36:33,000
He's not so innocent.

399
00:36:33,521 --> 00:36:36,783
It was you in the jungle, right?

400
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:41,565
All right.

401
00:36:42,087 --> 00:36:44,826
We'll decide this after the game.

402
00:36:45,087 --> 00:36:46,565
Leave him.

403
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:51,782
Come on, chaps.
Back to the game.

404
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,304
- We'll talk after the game.
- As you wish, Your Highness.

405
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:08,696
Well done, Smith.
Well done.

406
00:37:31,608 --> 00:37:34,304
Enjoy the game?
It was a good one.

407
00:37:42,739 --> 00:37:44,739
Long live Your Highness.

408
00:37:47,087 --> 00:37:50,478
All right, Chief.
What is the matter?

409
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:53,218
As you are aware, Your Highness...

410
00:37:53,434 --> 00:37:56,000
...there have been no rains.

411
00:37:56,218 --> 00:37:57,783
If we can live on...

412
00:37:58,696 --> 00:38:02,261
...what we have this year,
we may be able to get by.

413
00:38:02,479 --> 00:38:05,435
Our liege lord.
We've come to make a plea.

414
00:38:05,652 --> 00:38:09,652
Waive our lagaan
for this year, Lord.

415
00:38:10,869 --> 00:38:12,521
Listen, Chief.

416
00:38:12,739 --> 00:38:17,043
I fully understand
what you are all going through.

417
00:38:18,782 --> 00:38:21,218
But my hands are tied as well.

418
00:38:21,739 --> 00:38:26,956
These whites don't even spare
their own kin.

419
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,739
You will pay double lagaan.

420
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,217
- We'll die of hunger.
- We'll starve.

421
00:38:36,956 --> 00:38:40,391
- Any problem, Your Highness?
- Captain Russell...

422
00:38:40,653 --> 00:38:44,000
-...they have come with a petition.
- And that is?

423
00:38:44,218 --> 00:38:47,391
They want to be exempted
from paying lagaan.

424
00:38:47,653 --> 00:38:50,826
I told them it's not possible.

425
00:38:51,043 --> 00:38:53,522
But it is possible.

426
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:57,695
How?

427
00:38:58,826 --> 00:39:00,609
I will tell you.

428
00:39:03,217 --> 00:39:04,609
All right.

429
00:39:05,696 --> 00:39:08,130
I'll cancel the tax.

430
00:39:11,652 --> 00:39:13,957
But there is a condition.

431
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,043
Condition?

432
00:39:16,304 --> 00:39:18,087
What condition, sir?

433
00:39:19,305 --> 00:39:20,652
You.

434
00:39:23,304 --> 00:39:24,348
Come here.

435
00:39:34,261 --> 00:39:37,130
What was that you said
about our game?

436
00:39:37,348 --> 00:39:39,000
What did he say?

437
00:39:41,044 --> 00:39:43,826
"A stupid game."

438
00:39:45,522 --> 00:39:48,565
What do you know about this game?

439
00:39:51,043 --> 00:39:53,566
We've played it since we were kids.

440
00:39:53,782 --> 00:39:56,305
We call it gilli-danda and...

441
00:39:56,565 --> 00:39:59,652
- Who knows what you call it?
- Cricket!

442
00:40:02,348 --> 00:40:06,304
So you're saying that
you can play cricket too?

443
00:40:09,826 --> 00:40:12,087
Yes. It's easy.

444
00:40:15,565 --> 00:40:19,869
All right.
I'll cancel the lagaan.

445
00:40:20,347 --> 00:40:23,826
But you must
defeat us in this game.

446
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:27,782
This is the condition:

447
00:40:28,478 --> 00:40:33,522
You beat us at this game
and you won't have to pay lagaan.

448
00:40:38,695 --> 00:40:40,260
I'm serious.

449
00:40:43,435 --> 00:40:45,695
You beat us in this game...

450
00:40:46,434 --> 00:40:49,043
...and I'll cancel your tax.

451
00:40:56,608 --> 00:40:58,218
But...

452
00:40:58,478 --> 00:41:00,957
...if you lose...

453
00:41:01,174 --> 00:41:04,261
...you will have to pay triple tax.

454
00:41:04,522 --> 00:41:08,174
That is, three times the lagaan.

455
00:41:08,652 --> 00:41:10,913
All right?
What do you think?

456
00:41:11,782 --> 00:41:13,174
Do you accept?

457
00:41:28,521 --> 00:41:31,565
Sir, I think the cat's got his tongue.

458
00:41:32,912 --> 00:41:34,304
Quiet.

459
00:41:35,783 --> 00:41:39,478
All right.
I will raise the stakes.

460
00:41:40,565 --> 00:41:43,261
If you defeat us in this game...

461
00:41:43,479 --> 00:41:45,740
...I'll cancel not only...

462
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,478
...this year's lagaan,
but next year's as well.

463
00:41:50,957 --> 00:41:52,304
Agreed?

464
00:41:53,914 --> 00:41:56,696
Bhuvan!
Don't you say anything!

465
00:41:56,956 --> 00:42:00,348
- Don't say a word.
- Yes. Be silent.

466
00:42:02,261 --> 00:42:03,653
All right.

467
00:42:04,131 --> 00:42:07,218
I'll raise the stakes even higher.

468
00:42:08,131 --> 00:42:09,914
Not just one year.

469
00:42:10,174 --> 00:42:13,870
I'll cancel lagaan
for the next two years.

470
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:16,826
That means three years!

471
00:42:17,305 --> 00:42:21,608
And not just for you,
but for the whole province.

472
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:24,956
Now do you accept?

473
00:42:26,696 --> 00:42:29,609
He's digging a pit
to bury us in, Bhuvan.

474
00:42:29,825 --> 00:42:33,260
- Chief, you speak up now.
- Yes, Chief, speak up.

475
00:42:34,131 --> 00:42:35,653
- Sir...!?
- Shut up!

476
00:42:36,695 --> 00:42:38,087
You.

477
00:42:38,695 --> 00:42:39,739
Tell me.

478
00:42:41,696 --> 00:42:43,913
Will you pay double lagaan?

479
00:42:45,174 --> 00:42:47,261
Or do you accept the bet?

480
00:43:14,218 --> 00:43:16,435
I accept the bet.

481
00:43:25,088 --> 00:43:28,130
- Did he agree?
- Yes, he did.

482
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:30,000
All right.

483
00:43:31,087 --> 00:43:36,304
So it's decided. The game will be played
after three months.

484
00:43:37,218 --> 00:43:40,565
- This will kill us, Your Highness.
- We'll die.

485
00:43:41,174 --> 00:43:43,348
This is unfair.

486
00:43:44,869 --> 00:43:46,652
So is life.

487
00:44:13,522 --> 00:44:16,087
No lagaan if you win.

488
00:44:16,348 --> 00:44:20,218
But if we lose, we have to pay
three times the amount.

489
00:44:20,434 --> 00:44:23,566
And Bhuvan here
agreed to this condition!

490
00:44:23,826 --> 00:44:27,261
- What have you done?
- From double to triple!

491
00:44:27,434 --> 00:44:28,565
We are ruined!

492
00:44:28,826 --> 00:44:33,565
I told you we could
face a calamity, didn't I?

493
00:44:34,261 --> 00:44:36,479
Was there any choice?

494
00:44:36,739 --> 00:44:39,043
I ask you,
did we have a choice?

495
00:44:39,305 --> 00:44:41,304
What else could we do?

496
00:44:41,609 --> 00:44:44,217
Isn't double lagaan unjust?

497
00:44:44,783 --> 00:44:49,435
Are we strong enough to pay it?
Tell me, can anyone here pay it?

498
00:44:50,174 --> 00:44:53,175
This isn't a calamity.
It's an opportunity.

499
00:44:53,435 --> 00:44:55,652
This is not bravado.

500
00:44:55,869 --> 00:45:00,043
You have to get burnt
to save your home from fire.

501
00:45:01,695 --> 00:45:03,174
I know.

502
00:45:03,478 --> 00:45:05,739
I know we are weak.

503
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,174
But this way we have hope.

504
00:45:08,652 --> 00:45:12,348
And I want to turn
this hope into reality.

505
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:15,609
This game is for
our fields and harvest.

506
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:21,217
Have you forgotten? If we win,
we'll be happy for three years.

507
00:45:24,131 --> 00:45:26,044
Just think.

508
00:45:26,304 --> 00:45:29,043
No lagaan for three years.

509
00:45:29,391 --> 00:45:31,522
You know what that means?

510
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,174
It means our grain will be ours.
Only ours.

511
00:45:35,435 --> 00:45:37,783
Not a grain to be given.

512
00:45:38,044 --> 00:45:43,218
The welfare of our children,
our entire village, is in this.

513
00:45:43,479 --> 00:45:47,609
Our sweat will run
as blood in our veins.

514
00:45:50,131 --> 00:45:51,956
Marvellous!

515
00:45:52,565 --> 00:45:55,652
Such small eyes
dreaming such big dreams.

516
00:45:55,914 --> 00:45:59,261
Yes, Arjan, I have a dream.

517
00:45:59,652 --> 00:46:03,435
And only those who dream
can make them come true.

518
00:46:03,956 --> 00:46:07,348
Isar Kaka, three months is time enough.

519
00:46:07,826 --> 00:46:09,696
We can defeat them.

520
00:46:09,913 --> 00:46:13,869
A whole year of hitting with a stick
won't teach you...

521
00:46:14,087 --> 00:46:15,739
...this game!

522
00:46:16,043 --> 00:46:18,435
I know this isn't easy, Lakha.

523
00:46:18,652 --> 00:46:22,000
But, Chief,
it's not impossible either.

524
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:24,044
I need your support.

525
00:46:24,261 --> 00:46:28,130
Nobody in this village
will support you in this madness!

526
00:46:28,348 --> 00:46:30,217
- But Ismail...
- Enough.

527
00:46:31,001 --> 00:46:32,391
We've only one hope.

528
00:46:33,261 --> 00:46:38,652
We'll all go to Rajahji once again
and beg him to save us.

529
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:07,913
What are you thinking, Mother?

530
00:47:10,044 --> 00:47:13,566
About what happened today, son.

531
00:47:14,608 --> 00:47:18,739
I swear on you, Mother!
I did what was right.

532
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:24,739
I feel rage when we pay lagaan
to the Rajah.

533
00:47:25,348 --> 00:47:28,695
And he gives it
to those filthy whites.

534
00:47:29,957 --> 00:47:31,434
You tell me, Mother.

535
00:47:31,739 --> 00:47:35,565
Who ploughs the earth
to sow the seeds? We do.

536
00:47:35,783 --> 00:47:37,696
Who waters it?
We do.

537
00:47:37,956 --> 00:47:40,522
So why should we fill their coffers?

538
00:47:45,174 --> 00:47:49,957
The white sahib said that lagaan
may be cancelled for three years.

539
00:47:50,391 --> 00:47:52,869
How could I remain silent, Mother?

540
00:47:54,044 --> 00:47:55,608
You tell me.

541
00:47:56,392 --> 00:47:58,652
Should I have stayed silent?

542
00:48:01,522 --> 00:48:04,521
What are you looking at, Mother?

543
00:48:07,696 --> 00:48:11,218
You talk just like your father.

544
00:48:12,652 --> 00:48:17,304
He was just as spirited.
Always spoke the truth.

545
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:27,478
Go and sleep now.

546
00:48:28,304 --> 00:48:30,826
Don't let this burden you.

547
00:49:00,044 --> 00:49:03,044
Gauri?
What are you doing here?

548
00:49:05,131 --> 00:49:07,956
I came to see you.

549
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:12,304
To tell you...

550
00:49:12,522 --> 00:49:14,826
...that I am with you.

551
00:49:19,479 --> 00:49:21,087
I have faith...

552
00:49:21,261 --> 00:49:24,261
...in you and in your courage.

553
00:49:38,391 --> 00:49:40,782
That's all I came to say.

554
00:50:17,043 --> 00:50:21,304
Bhuvan Bhaiyya. I lost my gilli.
Make me another.

555
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,217
What's this?

556
00:50:28,695 --> 00:50:30,478
I'll tell you.

557
00:50:35,479 --> 00:50:37,826
Who knows what'll happen?

558
00:51:15,869 --> 00:51:18,696
It's not at all difficult, Tipu.

559
00:51:19,217 --> 00:51:22,478
They play it wearing pants
and call it " kirkut."

560
00:51:22,739 --> 00:51:26,609
We wear loincloths and call it
gilli-danda. Get it?

561
00:51:28,347 --> 00:51:32,260
Our fathers and grandfathers
played gilli-danda.

562
00:51:33,827 --> 00:51:35,392
Go over there.

563
00:51:36,305 --> 00:51:38,088
Back. Further back.

564
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,957
A little more. Stop.

565
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:42,957
Now catch the ball.

566
00:51:44,565 --> 00:51:46,392
Catch it properly, Tipu!

567
00:51:48,783 --> 00:51:50,999
Toss it to me. I'll show you.

568
00:51:54,652 --> 00:51:55,956
See that?

569
00:51:58,479 --> 00:52:01,566
It's very easy.
Why, even you can learn it!

570
00:52:01,826 --> 00:52:05,001
This game is just like gilli-danda.

571
00:52:05,695 --> 00:52:07,478
Catch.

572
00:52:08,304 --> 00:52:09,305
Very good!

573
00:52:11,565 --> 00:52:13,175
What a catch!

574
00:52:13,565 --> 00:52:16,870
Well done, Tipu.
Isn't it easy?

575
00:52:17,782 --> 00:52:22,305
Now throw the ball.
I'll show you how to hit it.

576
00:52:26,043 --> 00:52:27,087
Throw.

577
00:52:39,674 --> 00:52:41,369
Wow!
That's some throw!

578
00:52:41,935 --> 00:52:44,499
You throw well, Tipu!

579
00:52:46,283 --> 00:52:47,674
Gauri.
Throw it here.

580
00:52:50,805 --> 00:52:52,195
Hey, Gauri!

581
00:52:52,718 --> 00:52:56,022
What are you doing?
Go heat the water.

582
00:53:04,544 --> 00:53:05,891
Here, Tipu.

583
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:09,544
Now watch me this time.
It's very easy.

584
00:53:21,413 --> 00:53:23,456
Damn!
The stick slipped.

585
00:53:25,848 --> 00:53:28,239
My hands are sweaty.

586
00:53:32,717 --> 00:53:34,457
This should do the trick.

587
00:53:36,675 --> 00:53:37,979
Okay, Tipu, throw.

588
00:53:39,761 --> 00:53:41,414
And don't feel bad.

589
00:53:41,674 --> 00:53:43,370
This time I'll whack it.

590
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:46,021
" I'll whack it."

591
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:30,108
Wow!

592
00:54:42,065 --> 00:54:44,761
Hey, Bagha!
Throw the ball.

593
00:55:09,196 --> 00:55:12,413
- May I say something, Father?
- What?

594
00:55:12,674 --> 00:55:16,456
I feel Bhuvan is doing
the right thing.

595
00:55:17,195 --> 00:55:20,196
All right.
Go see if the water's boiling.

596
00:55:43,978 --> 00:55:46,847
That's it, Bagha.
Hit it hard.

597
00:55:50,544 --> 00:55:52,109
Well done, Bagha!

598
00:56:10,848 --> 00:56:14,631
Bhuvan, like Bagha,
I am also with you.

599
00:56:57,239 --> 00:56:58,848
Who are they, Father?

600
00:56:59,109 --> 00:57:02,674
Ramprasad and Namdeo.
Chiefs of Tanipura and Bhind.

601
00:57:09,979 --> 00:57:12,588
But with so many people...

602
00:57:17,195 --> 00:57:20,109
- Who is Bhuvan?
- Bhuvan?

603
00:57:20,326 --> 00:57:21,718
There he is.

604
00:57:24,848 --> 00:57:26,587
There he is!

605
00:57:35,978 --> 00:57:38,239
Stop, Ramprasad!

606
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:43,457
- Respect the code of honour!
- I've no quarrel with your village.

607
00:57:43,717 --> 00:57:46,369
We've come to teach Bhuvan a lesson!

608
00:57:47,891 --> 00:57:50,761
Why should we suffer
for what he's done?

609
00:57:50,978 --> 00:57:54,152
You bigmouth!
Who are you to decide for us?

610
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:58,195
- I've done what is good for us.
- To hell with your good!

611
00:57:58,413 --> 00:58:01,370
You must beg for forgiveness
from the sahib!

612
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:04,369
As for your game,
to hell with that!

613
00:58:04,587 --> 00:58:07,586
No? You are asking for trouble!

614
00:58:07,804 --> 00:58:10,543
Be calm, Ramprasad!
It'll be as you say.

615
00:58:10,805 --> 00:58:12,543
- But, Chief...
- Enough!

616
00:58:12,761 --> 00:58:14,934
No more buts!

617
00:58:18,326 --> 00:58:20,544
We must go to our Rajahji.

618
00:58:25,021 --> 00:58:30,152
The issue is not about the temple,
lagaan or the game.

619
00:58:30,586 --> 00:58:32,847
But of British honour.

620
00:58:34,152 --> 00:58:38,196
And Captain Russell's ego.

621
00:58:38,412 --> 00:58:42,065
Talk to the white sahib once more,
Your Highness.

622
00:58:42,326 --> 00:58:45,066
Forgive him, Your Highness.
He is naiiive.

623
00:58:45,326 --> 00:58:49,891
- He got carried away.
- It doesn't matter what he is.

624
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:53,283
He has challenged the British
on your behalf.

625
00:58:53,543 --> 00:58:58,283
He is ready to beg for forgiveness.
All of us are.

626
00:58:59,066 --> 00:59:01,412
I'll agree to 1 00 whiplashes.

627
00:59:02,153 --> 00:59:04,935
- But I won't beg for forgiveness.
- What?!

628
00:59:05,152 --> 00:59:07,543
It's too late for forgiving.

629
00:59:07,804 --> 00:59:10,587
You must pay for what you have done.

630
00:59:12,152 --> 00:59:14,195
So what shall we do then?

631
00:59:16,717 --> 00:59:19,370
I suggest you learn their game.

632
00:59:28,283 --> 00:59:31,891
Why are all these other guys
standing in the field?

633
00:59:32,153 --> 00:59:37,326
Like in gilli-danda,
to catch the gilli. I mean, the ball.

634
00:59:38,587 --> 00:59:39,717
How's that?!

635
00:59:41,283 --> 00:59:43,109
That is out, sir.

636
00:59:46,934 --> 00:59:49,891
Why does he point his finger
at the sky?

637
00:59:50,152 --> 00:59:52,109
I'm trying to understand.

638
00:59:52,326 --> 00:59:56,457
He's thinking of his mother.
She's sitting up there, right?

639
00:59:59,109 --> 01:00:01,457
Bowl it on the offside!

640
01:00:27,761 --> 01:00:30,674
Excuse me.
I'll just take a walk.

641
01:00:43,283 --> 01:00:44,630
Quiet.

642
01:00:48,717 --> 01:00:50,196
This bug's after me.

643
01:00:50,979 --> 01:00:52,544
Quiet!

644
01:00:58,370 --> 01:01:01,935
Quiet. The white lady is coming here.

645
01:01:12,805 --> 01:01:14,848
Damn, it's got in!

646
01:01:16,543 --> 01:01:19,239
Oh, no! It'll kill me!

647
01:01:25,326 --> 01:01:28,848
Miss? What happened?
These darkies bothering you?

648
01:01:29,066 --> 01:01:32,152
It's okay. They're farmers.
I know them.

649
01:01:32,370 --> 01:01:34,848
Thank you.
Carry on your game.

650
01:01:41,544 --> 01:01:43,631
I know what you were doing.

651
01:01:43,847 --> 01:01:46,326
You were trying to learn the game.

652
01:01:47,152 --> 01:01:50,717
No, memsahib. We're only
trying to learn the game.

653
01:01:52,369 --> 01:01:56,327
Oh, I thought you were
trying to learn the game.

654
01:01:56,805 --> 01:01:59,587
What's she saying, Bhuvan Bhaiyya?

655
01:01:59,847 --> 01:02:03,022
I think she's telling us to go.

656
01:02:03,412 --> 01:02:05,805
- All right, we're going.
- No.

657
01:02:06,413 --> 01:02:07,804
Wait.

658
01:02:10,152 --> 01:02:11,761
Ram Singh!

659
01:02:16,848 --> 01:02:18,891
Yes, memsahib.
What can I do?

660
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:23,022
Tell them that I would like
to help them learn the game.

661
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,282
Yes, memsahib.

662
01:02:24,544 --> 01:02:27,804
Memsahib says she'll help you
understand...

663
01:02:29,587 --> 01:02:31,587
Memsahib, just a minute.

664
01:02:35,630 --> 01:02:39,195
If Russell sahib...?
Russell sahib will get angry.

665
01:02:39,456 --> 01:02:43,369
- Ram Singh, can I trust you?
- Of course, memsahib.

666
01:02:43,587 --> 01:02:46,370
No one should know about this.

667
01:02:47,935 --> 01:02:49,760
All right, memsahib.

668
01:02:50,022 --> 01:02:52,239
No one will know.

669
01:02:54,805 --> 01:02:59,369
Memsahib says she wants to help you
understand the game.

670
01:02:59,587 --> 01:03:00,761
Really?

671
01:03:02,370 --> 01:03:05,543
But why?
After all, she's white too.

672
01:03:06,153 --> 01:03:08,414
The man wants to know...

673
01:03:08,674 --> 01:03:12,239
...why you want to do this
as you too are British.

674
01:03:13,892 --> 01:03:17,978
Tell him I know what happened is unfair
and I want to...

675
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,413
...give them a fair chance.

676
01:03:20,674 --> 01:03:23,718
Memsahib knows injustice
has been done.

677
01:03:23,935 --> 01:03:28,065
That's why she wants to give you
an equal chance.

678
01:03:29,021 --> 01:03:31,935
We are pleased to accept.
Thank you.

679
01:03:32,195 --> 01:03:35,152
He's happy to have your help
and thanks you.

680
01:03:35,327 --> 01:03:38,109
- Good.
- Wonderful!

681
01:03:39,152 --> 01:03:41,543
Tell him I'll meet him tomorrow.

682
01:03:41,804 --> 01:03:45,066
Same time, but not here.

683
01:03:45,326 --> 01:03:47,282
And not in their village.

684
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:49,326
Some other place?

685
01:03:49,587 --> 01:03:53,065
She'll see you tomorrow,
same time. But not here.

686
01:03:53,326 --> 01:03:56,500
Nor in the village.
Have you any other place?

687
01:03:57,413 --> 01:03:58,978
I got it.

688
01:03:59,196 --> 01:04:02,109
Behind the hill near the village.

689
01:04:02,543 --> 01:04:06,674
You can meet him next to the hill,
near the village.

690
01:04:06,934 --> 01:04:09,195
- I know the place.
- All right.

691
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:13,196
What's his name?

692
01:04:13,631 --> 01:04:16,500
Memsahib wants to know your names.

693
01:04:17,326 --> 01:04:20,283
He's Guran. That's Bagha.
This is Tipu.

694
01:04:20,543 --> 01:04:21,935
And I am Bhuvan.

695
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:25,631
No, no. Bhuvan.

696
01:04:33,457 --> 01:04:35,674
That one came out right!

697
01:04:37,282 --> 01:04:41,065
- My name is Elizabeth.
- Memsahib's name is Elizabeth.

698
01:04:41,326 --> 01:04:43,153
Ali...and what?

699
01:04:44,239 --> 01:04:47,544
My God! I'll twist my tongue
saying that!

700
01:04:49,152 --> 01:04:52,326
It's a nice name.
Whatever it may be.

701
01:04:56,935 --> 01:04:59,717
Memsahib, we're leaving.
Namaste.

702
01:05:01,413 --> 01:05:02,673
Come on.

703
01:05:16,325 --> 01:05:19,152
He'll never agree, Bhuvan.

704
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:20,934
Father.

705
01:05:24,369 --> 01:05:25,761
He will.

706
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:31,021
- Greetings, Bhabi.
- How are you?

707
01:05:31,239 --> 01:05:33,674
What are you up to, you imp?

708
01:05:35,196 --> 01:05:38,108
- Have you eaten, Goli?
- Yes.

709
01:05:38,326 --> 01:05:40,761
I didn't see you all day.

710
01:05:41,022 --> 01:05:44,935
I was busy preparing for the game.

711
01:05:45,456 --> 01:05:49,500
How's your game coming along?

712
01:05:49,717 --> 01:05:53,109
It's just the beginning.
We're learning.

713
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:59,717
Do you know everyone
is making fun of you?

714
01:05:59,934 --> 01:06:02,195
They say you've got fine players.

715
01:06:02,413 --> 01:06:06,586
Bagha and Guran. One knows
only how to beat the drum.

716
01:06:06,804 --> 01:06:09,805
The other keeps staring
like a madman.

717
01:06:10,021 --> 01:06:11,413
Oh, no!

718
01:06:13,153 --> 01:06:16,370
- It's the others who say this.
- Really?

719
01:06:17,066 --> 01:06:21,630
We also have a white lady with us.
She teaches us the game.

720
01:06:21,935 --> 01:06:23,935
A white lady?

721
01:06:25,152 --> 01:06:28,066
- Stop lying.
- Why don't you ask them?

722
01:06:31,935 --> 01:06:34,152
Is this true, Gauri?

723
01:06:34,588 --> 01:06:37,152
Yes. There is some white lady.

724
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:42,066
You're really going to play?

725
01:06:43,152 --> 01:06:45,369
Is there a choice?

726
01:06:45,891 --> 01:06:50,195
I don't have so much land like you
that I can sell off a bit.

727
01:06:50,413 --> 01:06:54,847
What do you mean? Why should l
sell my land? I'm not selling.

728
01:06:55,065 --> 01:06:58,500
Then is your grandmother
going to pay the lagaan?

729
01:07:04,413 --> 01:07:07,152
Well, I'd better be off.

730
01:07:11,718 --> 01:07:13,326
Hey, Bhuvan.

731
01:07:15,717 --> 01:07:19,414
- Could I be of any use?
- No, but your buffalo might be!

732
01:07:19,630 --> 01:07:22,979
- You're the most useful to us of all.
- How's that?

733
01:07:23,196 --> 01:07:26,674
You throw the ball the way
you swing your slingshot.

734
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:29,586
What deadly aim you have!

735
01:07:30,891 --> 01:07:32,718
Slingshot...

736
01:07:36,718 --> 01:07:39,587
Then we won't have to pay lagaan?

737
01:07:39,848 --> 01:07:41,457
Yes, Goli.

738
01:07:44,457 --> 01:07:47,326
We'll never go hungry.

739
01:07:49,587 --> 01:07:52,108
Will our dream come true?

740
01:07:53,848 --> 01:07:57,718
No, Bhuvan. It hurts too much
to dream like that.

741
01:07:59,979 --> 01:08:01,717
Have faith, Goli.

742
01:08:02,195 --> 01:08:07,239
He who has faith and courage
in his heart shall win in the end.

743
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,195
Beautifully said!

744
01:08:15,674 --> 01:08:18,413
Every saint

745
01:08:19,717 --> 01:08:23,891
And seer has said

746
01:08:25,630 --> 01:08:30,326
He who has truth and courage

747
01:08:31,153 --> 01:08:33,153
In his heart

748
01:08:34,413 --> 01:08:36,804
It is he

749
01:08:37,326 --> 01:08:40,413
Who wins in the end

750
01:08:57,804 --> 01:09:00,326
Come on, come on

751
01:09:00,544 --> 01:09:02,891
Come on, come on

752
01:09:03,499 --> 01:09:06,979
However long the path may be

753
01:09:07,239 --> 01:09:10,717
This body of yours
Shall not grow weary

754
01:09:11,848 --> 01:09:14,500
Come on

755
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:16,978
Hear the call of the road

756
01:09:17,196 --> 01:09:20,413
Let not the road
Remain waiting for you

757
01:09:20,804 --> 01:09:22,283
You come along

758
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:26,153
You are the king of this earth

759
01:09:26,369 --> 01:09:28,717
Know this for sure

760
01:09:29,108 --> 01:09:31,891
Go forth
And meet hardship head on

761
01:09:32,109 --> 01:09:34,718
Don't ever accept defeat

762
01:09:35,066 --> 01:09:37,196
Listen, my friend

763
01:09:37,457 --> 01:09:40,326
What is this fear you have?

764
01:09:40,587 --> 01:09:42,935
This earth is ours

765
01:09:43,195 --> 01:09:45,761
So is the sky

766
01:09:46,152 --> 01:09:48,630
Listen, my friend

767
01:09:48,848 --> 01:09:51,630
What is this fear you have?

768
01:09:56,892 --> 01:09:58,674
You come along

769
01:10:34,109 --> 01:10:37,152
Hear me, my friend

770
01:10:39,935 --> 01:10:42,065
What's in your heart

771
01:10:42,326 --> 01:10:45,065
Is in my heart too

772
01:10:45,283 --> 01:10:47,891
The dream you have

773
01:10:48,152 --> 01:10:50,587
Is also my dream in life

774
01:10:55,370 --> 01:10:58,717
Yes, we go on

775
01:10:58,935 --> 01:11:01,761
Our eyes lit with hope

776
01:11:02,109 --> 01:11:04,543
May this light of our hope

777
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:07,282
Never go out

778
01:11:07,762 --> 01:11:10,804
May never a storm

779
01:11:11,022 --> 01:11:12,847
Put out this light

780
01:11:15,370 --> 01:11:17,891
Listen, my friend

781
01:11:18,152 --> 01:11:20,761
What is this fear you have

782
01:11:20,978 --> 01:11:23,414
This earth is ours

783
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,326
So is the sky

784
01:12:25,630 --> 01:12:28,239
Listen, my friend

785
01:12:31,370 --> 01:12:34,022
This balmy easterly breeze

786
01:12:34,282 --> 01:12:36,805
Will cast its intoxicating spell

787
01:12:37,066 --> 01:12:39,500
If we call out in unison

788
01:12:40,065 --> 01:12:42,631
The season of flowers

789
01:12:44,631 --> 01:12:46,674
Will also come

790
01:12:47,022 --> 01:12:50,282
Happy days shall be here again

791
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:53,326
With no trace of sorrow

792
01:12:55,326 --> 01:12:57,630
Let's together create

793
01:12:57,848 --> 01:13:00,457
A festival ofjoyous colour

794
01:13:00,717 --> 01:13:03,153
Tell me why you stay

795
01:13:03,370 --> 01:13:05,892
Aloof this way

796
01:13:07,152 --> 01:13:09,544
Listen, my friend

797
01:13:09,848 --> 01:13:12,022
What is this fear you have?

798
01:13:12,544 --> 01:13:15,109
This earth is ours

799
01:13:15,326 --> 01:13:17,848
So is the sky

800
01:13:33,586 --> 01:13:36,022
Every saint

801
01:13:37,369 --> 01:13:41,978
And seer has said

802
01:13:43,195 --> 01:13:46,109
He who has truth and courage

803
01:13:46,369 --> 01:13:49,283
In his heart

804
01:13:51,153 --> 01:13:53,935
It is he

805
01:13:54,109 --> 01:13:56,370
Who wins in the end

806
01:15:07,065 --> 01:15:09,544
That lady is not here yet.

807
01:15:09,761 --> 01:15:13,587
- I'm here.
- We're waiting for the white lady.

808
01:15:13,891 --> 01:15:16,369
Not a girl but a lady!

809
01:15:17,065 --> 01:15:19,500
There she is, Bhuvan Bhaiyya!

810
01:15:30,761 --> 01:15:32,152
Tell me something.

811
01:15:32,414 --> 01:15:35,196
Why did that witch agree to help you?

812
01:15:35,456 --> 01:15:38,413
She took a fancy
to Bhuvan Bhaiyya.

813
01:15:38,673 --> 01:15:39,761
Is that so?

814
01:15:39,978 --> 01:15:41,457
Cheeky brat!

815
01:16:09,369 --> 01:16:11,066
Namaste.

816
01:16:11,326 --> 01:16:13,327
Namaste.

817
01:16:14,022 --> 01:16:15,413
Who are they?

818
01:16:15,673 --> 01:16:19,152
Wow!
You learned our language very fast.

819
01:16:21,108 --> 01:16:23,979
Ram Singh taught me.
Who are they?

820
01:16:24,587 --> 01:16:27,066
You know Tipu, Bagha and Guran.

821
01:16:27,282 --> 01:16:31,239
This is Goli. He's Isar Kaka.
And this is Gauri.

822
01:16:31,935 --> 01:16:33,326
Gauri.

823
01:16:34,326 --> 01:16:36,674
We'll meet again.

824
01:16:37,022 --> 01:16:39,066
Memsahib, that was wrong.

825
01:16:39,283 --> 01:16:43,109
You should say,
" I'm glad to meet you."

826
01:16:43,587 --> 01:16:44,804
Gosh!

827
01:16:45,152 --> 01:16:46,499
I'm sorry.

828
01:16:46,761 --> 01:16:48,717
I'm glad to meet you.

829
01:16:49,891 --> 01:16:52,500
We're glad to meet you too.

830
01:16:55,109 --> 01:16:58,196
- What do you know about the game?
- What?

831
01:16:58,413 --> 01:17:02,152
Memsahib wants to know
what you know about the game.

832
01:17:02,413 --> 01:17:03,761
Lots!

833
01:17:04,066 --> 01:17:07,544
There are six sticks.
Three on either side.

834
01:17:07,804 --> 01:17:11,282
Two fellows stand with planks
before the sticks.

835
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:14,804
One runs near the sticks
and throws a ball.

836
01:17:15,022 --> 01:17:17,630
The other hits the ball
with his plank.

837
01:17:17,891 --> 01:17:20,282
And everyone runs
here and there.

838
01:17:20,544 --> 01:17:23,979
One of them grabs the ball
and gives it back.

839
01:17:24,195 --> 01:17:28,370
He throws the ball again
at the guy who twirls the plank.

840
01:17:28,586 --> 01:17:30,587
This goes on all day.

841
01:17:30,848 --> 01:17:34,848
Throw the ball, twirl the plank.
Throw and twirl. Right?

842
01:17:35,283 --> 01:17:38,152
Memsahib, I can't translate all that.

843
01:17:38,587 --> 01:17:40,587
No need, Ram Singh.

844
01:17:40,848 --> 01:17:42,979
I understood most of that.

845
01:17:43,848 --> 01:17:45,675
He knows nothing.

846
01:17:47,239 --> 01:17:50,717
This is what a cricket field looks like.

847
01:17:50,978 --> 01:17:54,239
- This is the field.
- This is a cricket pitch.

848
01:17:54,413 --> 01:17:57,369
The game is played on this strip.

849
01:17:57,630 --> 01:18:02,587
There are three main aspects:
batting, bowling and fielding.

850
01:18:02,847 --> 01:18:06,239
There are three aspects:
Wielding the bat...

851
01:18:06,457 --> 01:18:09,979
...throwing the ball
and guarding the field.

852
01:18:10,239 --> 01:18:13,414
Even our great-uncles won't
understand this.

853
01:18:14,108 --> 01:18:15,674
What did he say?

854
01:18:15,848 --> 01:18:19,631
This language, even his
ancestors won't understand.

855
01:18:21,631 --> 01:18:23,674
Better make it simpler.

856
01:18:23,891 --> 01:18:28,674
Cricket is played by two teams,
say yours and the English.

857
01:18:28,934 --> 01:18:31,543
Each team has 1 1 players.

858
01:18:31,805 --> 01:18:36,196
Five batters, five bowlers
and one wicketkeeper.

859
01:19:07,065 --> 01:19:08,457
Gauri.

860
01:19:09,108 --> 01:19:10,718
Gauri.

861
01:19:11,152 --> 01:19:12,240
Yes?

862
01:19:12,456 --> 01:19:14,283
What happened?

863
01:19:15,413 --> 01:19:17,195
What happened?

864
01:19:18,544 --> 01:19:21,108
- Nothing.
- Memsahib...

865
01:19:21,326 --> 01:19:24,500
...l think we should leave.
It's getting late.

866
01:19:24,761 --> 01:19:27,457
This is enough for today.

867
01:19:30,717 --> 01:19:33,891
- We'll begin with a little prayer.
- Hari Om.

868
01:19:34,109 --> 01:19:35,761
Catch, Bagha.

869
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:42,240
Everyone, try catching the ball.
Don't let it drop.

870
01:19:42,457 --> 01:19:47,195
Bhuvan, the white lady said
there must be 1 1 in a team.

871
01:19:47,413 --> 01:19:49,195
We are only five.

872
01:19:49,413 --> 01:19:51,370
Why five?
I'm here too.

873
01:19:51,631 --> 01:19:54,978
Whatever the white lady can do,
so can I.

874
01:19:55,196 --> 01:19:58,891
All right, Gauri.
We're six, not five.

875
01:19:59,239 --> 01:20:04,631
You are doing it for your village,
I'm sure the others will too.

876
01:20:04,892 --> 01:20:07,761
- If not, we'll drag them in anyway.
- Goli!

877
01:20:08,457 --> 01:20:09,934
Catch the ball!

878
01:20:30,848 --> 01:20:34,109
- Who threw this ball?
- Goli Chacha did?

879
01:20:36,196 --> 01:20:38,066
Goli, you jackass!

880
01:20:38,369 --> 01:20:40,370
I'm gonna get you today!

881
01:20:41,153 --> 01:20:43,021
There they go again.

882
01:20:43,326 --> 01:20:46,022
I'll crack you open like an egg!

883
01:20:47,152 --> 01:20:50,326
Will you two stop your squabbling?

884
01:20:51,413 --> 01:20:56,022
- Isar Kaka, don't interfere!
- Stop it, you fools.

885
01:21:02,674 --> 01:21:03,935
Gauri...

886
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:06,457
...our sixth player.

887
01:21:06,717 --> 01:21:07,934
Bhura!

888
01:21:10,196 --> 01:21:11,239
Wow!

889
01:21:12,239 --> 01:21:15,414
Did you see how a ball is caught,
Isar Kaka?

890
01:21:15,630 --> 01:21:18,892
Amazing!
Like a bird diving for fish.

891
01:21:19,109 --> 01:21:22,805
- Oh, so that's how it's done?
- Of course!

892
01:21:23,022 --> 01:21:25,631
Bhura, show it to them once more.

893
01:21:25,891 --> 01:21:30,674
Especially to Goli here.
He just doesn't know how to catch.

894
01:21:30,891 --> 01:21:34,065
Everybody!
Go there and watch carefully.

895
01:21:34,326 --> 01:21:35,848
Come on, Goli.

896
01:21:36,283 --> 01:21:37,718
Ready, Bhura?

897
01:21:40,196 --> 01:21:41,544
Watch carefully.

898
01:21:42,718 --> 01:21:43,804
You see that?!

899
01:21:44,065 --> 01:21:47,630
Brilliant, Bhura.
That was something.

900
01:21:48,348 --> 01:21:50,869
But where did you learn that?

901
01:21:51,087 --> 01:21:52,261
I'll tell you.

902
01:21:52,478 --> 01:21:57,521
A ball travels in a straight line.
But hens run in a zigzag!

903
01:21:57,783 --> 01:22:00,913
To catch hens,
you've got to be quick.

904
01:22:01,131 --> 01:22:02,653
Like Bhura.

905
01:22:02,913 --> 01:22:06,173
Bhura will teach us now.
Won't you?

906
01:22:06,391 --> 01:22:09,174
I'll teach you, but...

907
01:22:09,435 --> 01:22:10,957
But what?

908
01:22:13,521 --> 01:22:15,521
What about my hens?

909
01:22:16,392 --> 01:22:20,869
Bhura, these hens of yours
are a real pain!

910
01:22:50,087 --> 01:22:52,043
At ease, captain.

911
01:22:52,304 --> 01:22:56,434
You know Major Cotton.
That is Major Warren.

912
01:22:57,783 --> 01:22:59,348
Take a seat.

913
01:23:03,957 --> 01:23:05,001
Now...

914
01:23:05,261 --> 01:23:07,304
...what is this we hear...

915
01:23:07,522 --> 01:23:12,217
...that you have agreed to cancel
the tax of the farmers...

916
01:23:12,479 --> 01:23:15,391
...if they beat you
in a game of cricket?

917
01:23:15,566 --> 01:23:16,783
Is this true?

918
01:23:17,869 --> 01:23:20,261
Yes, Colonel Boyer. It is.

919
01:23:20,478 --> 01:23:23,740
What are you here for?
To play games?

920
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:28,782
Let me remind you that you are
working for Her Majesty, the Queen.

921
01:23:29,043 --> 01:23:33,131
Your job is to ensure
the smooth running of your province.

922
01:23:33,348 --> 01:23:35,913
Pardon me.
But that's what I'm doing.

923
01:23:36,173 --> 01:23:39,174
We'll be the judge of that, Russell.

924
01:23:39,478 --> 01:23:43,565
We also understand that
if you lose this "match" ...

925
01:23:43,783 --> 01:23:47,348
...you will cancel their taxes
for three years.

926
01:23:47,609 --> 01:23:51,392
Not just Champaner,
but the entire province.

927
01:23:52,348 --> 01:23:56,261
- But they won't win.
- You're missing the whole point.

928
01:23:56,522 --> 01:24:01,173
Do you realise we could have
a situation where there will be...

929
01:24:01,435 --> 01:24:05,044
...cricket matches all over
the subcontinent...

930
01:24:05,304 --> 01:24:06,826
...to cancel the tax?

931
01:24:07,087 --> 01:24:11,305
But there is one thing.
If they lose, which they will...

932
01:24:13,175 --> 01:24:16,261
...they will have to pay
three times the tax.

933
01:24:16,478 --> 01:24:18,217
Oh, this is ridiculous!

934
01:24:18,478 --> 01:24:21,739
He's making the government
into a bookie...

935
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,044
...with whom he can
place his wagers.

936
01:24:25,348 --> 01:24:28,609
What would you have us do next?
Race horses?

937
01:24:28,827 --> 01:24:31,304
This is the most preposterous idea!

938
01:24:31,566 --> 01:24:34,217
The British Empire
cannot function...

939
01:24:34,435 --> 01:24:37,087
...according to your
whims and fancies.

940
01:24:37,304 --> 01:24:39,870
Now jolly well understand this:

941
01:24:41,174 --> 01:24:44,217
If you win, you'll have had
a narrow escape.

942
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:48,652
But if you lose, you will pay
the taxes for Champaner...

943
01:24:48,913 --> 01:24:52,087
...and the entire province yourself.

944
01:24:52,305 --> 01:24:56,261
Then you'll be sent to Central Africa.
Is that clear?

945
01:24:57,348 --> 01:24:58,391
Yes, sir.

946
01:25:00,392 --> 01:25:02,783
That will be all.
You may go.

947
01:25:42,696 --> 01:25:47,652
You're supposed to salute
when a superior officer passes!

948
01:25:47,914 --> 01:25:50,956
- I did, sir.
- I didn't see it.

949
01:25:53,087 --> 01:25:54,348
That's better.

950
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:58,261
- Your meeting did not go well.
- Damn right, it didn't.

951
01:25:58,434 --> 01:26:01,826
The old hats will teach me
how to run the show.

952
01:26:02,087 --> 01:26:04,913
They've lost their sense of adventure.

953
01:26:05,131 --> 01:26:08,087
What's wrong with some fun
along with the lagaan?

954
01:26:08,348 --> 01:26:11,044
- Is the match cancelled, sir?
- No!

955
01:26:15,218 --> 01:26:17,826
How dare you hurt my horse?

956
01:26:20,522 --> 01:26:24,348
Hurt my horse, will you?
I'll destroy you people!

957
01:26:24,609 --> 01:26:27,348
I'll take so much lagaan...

958
01:26:27,608 --> 01:26:30,782
...you won't have a rag
on your backs.

959
01:26:34,956 --> 01:26:37,957
You bloody slaves
will remain crushed...

960
01:26:38,218 --> 01:26:40,566
...under our boots!

961
01:26:55,435 --> 01:26:58,739
However thick the sole
may be, sahib...

962
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:03,000
...it wears out.
Then the nails begin to prick.

963
01:27:03,609 --> 01:27:04,652
Ram Singh!

964
01:27:06,739 --> 01:27:07,913
Yes, sir?

965
01:27:08,175 --> 01:27:11,652
- Get him out before I kill him.
- Yes.

966
01:27:13,087 --> 01:27:14,348
Quick.

967
01:27:41,435 --> 01:27:43,174
Arjan, what happened?

968
01:27:43,392 --> 01:27:47,348
Bhuvan, I've been blind
and stupid.

969
01:27:48,392 --> 01:27:50,435
I am with you now.

970
01:27:50,695 --> 01:27:52,913
Tell me, how can I help?

971
01:27:53,131 --> 01:27:57,478
That's great. We're coming together
to form a fist.

972
01:28:05,131 --> 01:28:07,696
No, no, Arjan.
Not like that.

973
01:28:22,391 --> 01:28:25,565
Lakha, Goli was telling the truth.

974
01:28:25,826 --> 01:28:28,566
- About what?
- The white lady.

975
01:28:29,435 --> 01:28:30,652
So?

976
01:28:36,217 --> 01:28:39,174
We were wrong, Lakha.

977
01:28:39,435 --> 01:28:44,174
But we can still make it right.
We must support Bhuvan.

978
01:28:45,087 --> 01:28:47,783
What did you say?
Have you gone crazy?

979
01:28:48,044 --> 01:28:50,435
Try to understand.

980
01:28:50,652 --> 01:28:51,696
Look.

981
01:28:52,174 --> 01:28:53,261
Look!

982
01:28:53,522 --> 01:28:55,435
An English girl...

983
01:28:55,695 --> 01:28:59,130
...is helping us
save our bodies and souls.

984
01:28:59,348 --> 01:29:02,392
And we sit sulking?

985
01:29:02,652 --> 01:29:05,043
Shame on us!

986
01:29:07,739 --> 01:29:12,521
It is Allah's command.
We must be with him.

987
01:29:13,130 --> 01:29:14,696
Come with me. Come!

988
01:29:15,305 --> 01:29:16,739
Ismail...

989
01:29:17,043 --> 01:29:20,740
...have you gone senile?
Then get yourself a crutch...

990
01:29:20,913 --> 01:29:23,174
...and a shroud too.

991
01:29:25,913 --> 01:29:29,000
This Bhuvan of yours
will never succeed.

992
01:29:32,827 --> 01:29:34,217
Ismail...

993
01:29:34,956 --> 01:29:38,000
...he'll never take you
into his team.

994
01:29:39,739 --> 01:29:41,304
Now catch this!

995
01:29:46,695 --> 01:29:48,001
Bhuvan...

996
01:29:49,391 --> 01:29:53,434
...it's not just your honour,
but that of the whole village.

997
01:29:53,913 --> 01:29:58,826
I'm ashamed of all the things
I said the other day.

998
01:29:59,087 --> 01:30:00,565
I swear by God...

999
01:30:00,782 --> 01:30:05,130
...l am with you.
It's the word of a man of prayer.

1000
01:30:05,348 --> 01:30:09,652
What a beautiful thing to say!
He has raised our spirits.

1001
01:30:09,870 --> 01:30:11,957
Who can stop us now?

1002
01:30:26,652 --> 01:30:29,478
With a procession
Of elephants and horses

1003
01:30:29,740 --> 01:30:33,043
Raise a cry of victory
To Lord Krishna

1004
01:30:49,739 --> 01:30:52,087
What are you looking at, memsahib?

1005
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:56,391
These statues.
Whose images are those?

1006
01:30:56,653 --> 01:31:01,608
This is the temple of Radha
and Krishna. These are their idols.

1007
01:31:01,826 --> 01:31:05,696
Today is Krishna's birthday,
so the idols are decorated.

1008
01:31:06,392 --> 01:31:08,478
It's very beautiful.

1009
01:31:08,739 --> 01:31:09,739
Yes.

1010
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,478
Were they husband and wife?

1011
01:31:12,739 --> 01:31:14,131
Oh, no, memsahib.

1012
01:31:14,391 --> 01:31:18,739
Krishna was married to Rukmini
and Radha to Anay.

1013
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:24,305
But the deep love they had
for each other set an ideal.

1014
01:31:24,956 --> 01:31:26,696
It's like...

1015
01:31:26,956 --> 01:31:30,348
...a dewdrop on a lotus leaf.

1016
01:31:31,044 --> 01:31:34,131
Neither united nor separated.

1017
01:31:34,825 --> 01:31:37,869
They've been worshipped together
for eons.

1018
01:31:48,131 --> 01:31:51,218
- Pujariji?
- Oh, yes, Gauri.

1019
01:32:07,696 --> 01:32:08,913
Let's go.

1020
01:32:28,218 --> 01:32:32,739
If Krishna were to meet
A lovelorn nymph in the grove

1021
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:37,218
And then smile and talk
Or even tease her

1022
01:32:37,435 --> 01:32:39,391
How can Radha be not jealous?

1023
01:32:39,609 --> 01:32:42,348
How can Radha be not jealous?

1024
01:32:42,565 --> 01:32:44,652
Her body and heart
Are on fire

1025
01:32:53,609 --> 01:32:58,130
Even if Krishna were to meet
A lovelorn nymph in the grove

1026
01:32:58,652 --> 01:33:02,869
It's only Radha's love
That blooms in his heart

1027
01:33:03,130 --> 01:33:05,435
Then why is Radha jealous?

1028
01:33:08,130 --> 01:33:10,435
With no rhyme or reason

1029
01:33:10,653 --> 01:33:13,217
Why is Radha jealous?

1030
01:33:41,782 --> 01:33:46,521
The nymphs are but stars
And Radha is the moon

1031
01:33:46,782 --> 01:33:51,043
Why is her faith then
So half-hearted?

1032
01:34:03,826 --> 01:34:08,044
Faithless Krishna is forever
Looking hither and thither

1033
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:13,174
Then how can poor Radha
Believe in herself?

1034
01:34:13,435 --> 01:34:18,086
Nymphs come and go
But Radha is the queen of his heart

1035
01:34:23,130 --> 01:34:25,479
Dawn and dusk
By the Jamuna's banks

1036
01:34:25,739 --> 01:34:28,826
It's only Radha
That Krishna calls out to

1037
01:34:29,435 --> 01:34:34,043
If someone garlands Krishna
With her entwined arms

1038
01:34:34,304 --> 01:34:36,870
How can Radha be not jealous?

1039
01:34:39,434 --> 01:34:41,434
Her body and heart
Are on fire

1040
01:34:41,652 --> 01:34:44,218
How can Radha be not jealous?

1041
01:35:28,783 --> 01:35:32,957
If Radha is enshrined
In Krishna's heart

1042
01:35:33,348 --> 01:35:37,478
Why doesn't he tell her so?

1043
01:35:38,652 --> 01:35:42,739
Love has its own language
Its own expression

1044
01:35:43,217 --> 01:35:47,695
Let the eyes speak
Such is Krishna's sweet wish

1045
01:35:47,913 --> 01:35:49,956
These eyes of yours
O Krishna

1046
01:35:50,131 --> 01:35:53,566
They destroy the peace
Of many a nymph's heart

1047
01:35:57,696 --> 01:35:59,913
She meets your eyes
And is in love

1048
01:36:00,173 --> 01:36:02,566
Even if she be
The fairest damsel

1049
01:36:02,782 --> 01:36:07,305
If love for Krishna ripens
In a nymph's heart

1050
01:36:07,696 --> 01:36:10,565
Why is Radha jealous?

1051
01:36:12,653 --> 01:36:15,435
How can Radha be not jealous?

1052
01:37:29,739 --> 01:37:34,652
Gauri, you sing
and dance beautifully.

1053
01:38:30,956 --> 01:38:35,740
Elizabeth, this is Lt. Edward Wesson.
This is Lt. Richard North.

1054
01:38:35,956 --> 01:38:37,783
- How do you do?
- Charmed.

1055
01:38:37,956 --> 01:38:42,262
Sir, there's a villager
who'd like to speak with you.

1056
01:38:42,478 --> 01:38:44,087
Not now. Tomorrow.

1057
01:38:44,305 --> 01:38:49,304
He says he has some important
information about the match.

1058
01:38:51,217 --> 01:38:52,652
Excuse me.

1059
01:39:03,304 --> 01:39:04,304
Sahib.

1060
01:39:05,260 --> 01:39:07,435
Long live our protector.

1061
01:39:08,348 --> 01:39:13,696
- What is it you want to tell me?
- Bhuvan is training his team. But...

1062
01:39:14,435 --> 01:39:15,565
But what?

1063
01:39:15,782 --> 01:39:17,870
Spare my life, sahib!

1064
01:39:18,087 --> 01:39:20,609
But a white memsahib
from here...

1065
01:39:20,869 --> 01:39:23,130
...teaches them the game.

1066
01:39:23,783 --> 01:39:24,957
White memsahib?

1067
01:39:25,218 --> 01:39:28,956
Yes, sahib.
I saw her with my own eyes today.

1068
01:39:29,218 --> 01:39:33,087
She also came to attend
the prayer at our temple today.

1069
01:39:45,913 --> 01:39:48,521
Is the white memsahib among them?

1070
01:39:54,174 --> 01:39:55,391
There she is.

1071
01:40:00,478 --> 01:40:05,044
- You're not making a mistake?
- You can hang me if I'm mistaken.

1072
01:40:05,304 --> 01:40:07,087
I swear.
She's the one.

1073
01:40:13,218 --> 01:40:15,218
So you too are in the team?

1074
01:40:15,434 --> 01:40:20,696
I'm not crazy like Bhuvan to
challenge the might of the government.

1075
01:40:21,565 --> 01:40:25,000
Why are you telling me all this?

1076
01:40:26,304 --> 01:40:30,217
Only the slaughtered beast knows
the agony of death.

1077
01:40:31,131 --> 01:40:33,087
I too am in agony.

1078
01:40:33,392 --> 01:40:38,609
Let's just say that my victory
lies in Bhuvan's defeat.

1079
01:40:46,783 --> 01:40:48,826
What is your name?
Your name?

1080
01:40:49,044 --> 01:40:50,391
Lakha, sahib.

1081
01:40:51,740 --> 01:40:53,130
Lakha...

1082
01:40:54,261 --> 01:40:55,913
...this is what you do:

1083
01:40:56,174 --> 01:40:59,609
You join Bhuvan's team.

1084
01:41:00,044 --> 01:41:04,609
- What are you saying, sahib?
- You will join Bhuvan's team.

1085
01:41:04,826 --> 01:41:07,522
But you will work for me.

1086
01:41:13,261 --> 01:41:14,870
I understand, sahib.

1087
01:41:27,435 --> 01:41:29,218
Yes, Andrew?

1088
01:41:29,739 --> 01:41:31,261
What is it?

1089
01:41:31,479 --> 01:41:33,695
So you've been sightseeing.

1090
01:41:33,957 --> 01:41:36,088
How's the countryside?

1091
01:41:37,435 --> 01:41:39,653
It's beautiful.

1092
01:41:40,261 --> 01:41:43,696
The mountains, the woods,
the cattle.

1093
01:41:43,957 --> 01:41:45,479
And the villages?

1094
01:41:47,827 --> 01:41:51,174
- I didn't see any.
- My foot, you didn't!

1095
01:41:51,392 --> 01:41:56,217
You were teaching them cricket!
You thought I wouldn't know?

1096
01:41:56,479 --> 01:42:00,087
You had the audacity to go
against your own brother?

1097
01:42:00,392 --> 01:42:02,783
Now you listen to me carefully.

1098
01:42:03,044 --> 01:42:05,392
You will not meet them again...

1099
01:42:05,652 --> 01:42:09,044
...because you will not
leave the cantonment.

1100
01:42:09,696 --> 01:42:11,348
Is that understood?

1101
01:42:55,391 --> 01:42:59,131
Why are you worried?
Our game is improving day by day.

1102
01:42:59,391 --> 01:43:03,044
Goli, you throw the ball
with a lot of passion.

1103
01:43:03,695 --> 01:43:07,608
Why do you just stand there
after hitting the ball, Arjan?

1104
01:43:08,086 --> 01:43:09,913
You should run.

1105
01:43:18,565 --> 01:43:22,218
When I saw you all playing
together today...

1106
01:43:23,348 --> 01:43:26,044
...l realized
the wrong I'd done.

1107
01:43:26,217 --> 01:43:28,695
I regret it very much.

1108
01:43:30,305 --> 01:43:32,305
Can I play with you?

1109
01:43:41,261 --> 01:43:43,087
No.

1110
01:43:43,521 --> 01:43:45,696
- You can't play.
- Why?

1111
01:43:45,914 --> 01:43:49,957
Try and understand the game.
It's not like chopping wood.

1112
01:43:50,218 --> 01:43:52,869
It needs special skills. Right?

1113
01:43:53,478 --> 01:43:55,391
Yes, absolutely.

1114
01:43:55,608 --> 01:43:57,043
Take Goli now.

1115
01:43:57,261 --> 01:44:01,218
He throws the ball
like he swings the slingshot.

1116
01:44:01,739 --> 01:44:02,870
And Bhura here...

1117
01:44:03,044 --> 01:44:07,695
...he pounces on the ball the way
he grabs his runaway hens.

1118
01:44:08,261 --> 01:44:12,913
Arjan has iron hands
from all that hammering.

1119
01:44:13,218 --> 01:44:14,261
Right.

1120
01:44:14,435 --> 01:44:18,956
If money doesn't slip through
Isar Kaka's hands, how can a ball?

1121
01:44:19,217 --> 01:44:20,869
And we do need...

1122
01:44:21,131 --> 01:44:25,391
...a physician
for cuts and bruises.

1123
01:44:26,044 --> 01:44:28,565
And what about
Bagha's strength?

1124
01:44:28,826 --> 01:44:31,652
Tough as teak.

1125
01:44:34,869 --> 01:44:35,913
And Guran...

1126
01:44:36,087 --> 01:44:39,305
...passion runs like a fever
through this loony.

1127
01:44:39,478 --> 01:44:43,739
Saturn is strong and Mars mighty.

1128
01:44:44,347 --> 01:44:47,086
And Ismail,
as far as I remember...

1129
01:44:47,348 --> 01:44:50,609
...we've always been
rivals in gilli-danda.

1130
01:44:50,826 --> 01:44:52,957
- And I?
- Ah, Tipu!

1131
01:44:53,217 --> 01:44:55,826
Our Tipu is so bright.

1132
01:44:56,957 --> 01:45:00,478
Now tell me, Lakha,
what can you do?

1133
01:45:00,740 --> 01:45:02,696
l...

1134
01:45:03,174 --> 01:45:05,609
I can run very fast.

1135
01:45:05,827 --> 01:45:08,739
So, you can run...

1136
01:45:09,478 --> 01:45:12,131
Okay, then do one thing.

1137
01:45:12,392 --> 01:45:16,000
Let's see you sprint up
the temple steps three times.

1138
01:45:16,217 --> 01:45:18,739
Real quick.
Can you do it?

1139
01:45:24,304 --> 01:45:27,000
Okay, Lakha. Run.

1140
01:45:27,391 --> 01:45:29,609
Don't fall!

1141
01:45:32,435 --> 01:45:34,826
Even I can run faster than him!

1142
01:45:37,826 --> 01:45:41,913
Bhuvan, don't take him.
There's malice in his heart.

1143
01:45:42,174 --> 01:45:45,391
No, Gauri. We need him.

1144
01:45:46,130 --> 01:45:49,652
Chopping all that wood has made
his hands strong.

1145
01:45:49,913 --> 01:45:52,348
He'll hit the ball really hard.

1146
01:45:54,088 --> 01:45:56,086
Come on, run!
Yes, run.

1147
01:45:59,435 --> 01:46:01,261
At least he's trying!

1148
01:46:01,478 --> 01:46:05,434
- I'll get you a pain-relief ointment.
- Hurry! Run.

1149
01:46:07,652 --> 01:46:09,652
He's back.

1150
01:46:15,566 --> 01:46:18,392
Did you see that, Bhuvan?

1151
01:46:18,653 --> 01:46:20,087
What do you say?

1152
01:46:20,305 --> 01:46:23,652
You run a tad slow, pal.
You have to be faster.

1153
01:46:23,870 --> 01:46:26,304
I'll improve.
I'll run every day!

1154
01:46:26,565 --> 01:46:29,348
But take me into the team.

1155
01:46:29,566 --> 01:46:33,870
I can't bear the thought of
the village being dishonoured.

1156
01:46:34,130 --> 01:46:36,956
- What do you say?
- Give him a chance.

1157
01:46:37,174 --> 01:46:38,957
Okay, let's try him out.

1158
01:46:39,217 --> 01:46:41,130
Look, Lakha...

1159
01:46:42,827 --> 01:46:47,000
...cheating at games has been
a childhood habit of yours.

1160
01:46:47,261 --> 01:46:50,522
- You're not...
- What are you saying, Ismail?

1161
01:46:50,739 --> 01:46:54,174
I'm sorry.
Truly sorry, I swear.

1162
01:46:54,435 --> 01:46:58,261
Okay, Lakha, you're in.

1163
01:46:58,522 --> 01:47:02,000
But remember:
It's a huge responsibility.

1164
01:47:02,262 --> 01:47:04,696
For the whites, it's a game.

1165
01:47:05,174 --> 01:47:06,999
But for us...

1166
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:09,478
...it's our life.

1167
01:47:09,826 --> 01:47:10,869
Yes, Bhuvan.

1168
01:47:11,826 --> 01:47:13,869
I am with you.

1169
01:48:01,478 --> 01:48:05,434
From now on,
you will play with this ball.

1170
01:48:06,261 --> 01:48:07,870
Oh, wow!

1171
01:48:09,392 --> 01:48:13,174
Memsahib, your support has
really lifted our spirits.

1172
01:48:13,435 --> 01:48:14,957
Thank you.

1173
01:48:15,739 --> 01:48:17,914
Goli gets to try it out first.

1174
01:48:18,174 --> 01:48:21,522
Forget the ball now.
You must all eat first.

1175
01:48:21,739 --> 01:48:26,304
It's to fill our bellies that
we are playing. Wait a while.

1176
01:48:26,566 --> 01:48:28,086
Come on, all of you.

1177
01:48:28,565 --> 01:48:30,565
Bhura, get over there.

1178
01:48:36,826 --> 01:48:38,653
Oh, he's making me run!

1179
01:48:38,869 --> 01:48:40,826
Wow! That was some hit!

1180
01:48:56,652 --> 01:48:58,131
Give me the ball.

1181
01:49:17,566 --> 01:49:18,956
Who is Bhuvan?

1182
01:49:20,260 --> 01:49:21,434
I am Bhuvan.

1183
01:49:23,739 --> 01:49:25,087
And you are...?

1184
01:49:26,435 --> 01:49:30,001
I'm Deva.
Deva Singh Sodhi.

1185
01:49:31,130 --> 01:49:33,131
I've come from Dhaulpur.

1186
01:49:33,782 --> 01:49:38,696
I hear you've vowed
to fight the British.

1187
01:49:40,869 --> 01:49:44,652
Yes, but not with sticks and spears.
With bat and ball.

1188
01:49:44,913 --> 01:49:48,695
Whether with sticks and spears
or bat and ball...

1189
01:49:48,956 --> 01:49:53,609
...l want to be in every battle
against the British.

1190
01:49:53,870 --> 01:49:57,956
Let me lend a helping hand
in this fight, Bhuvan.

1191
01:49:58,174 --> 01:50:00,739
I have played this game before.

1192
01:50:01,826 --> 01:50:02,870
When?

1193
01:50:03,435 --> 01:50:06,087
I was in the British army.

1194
01:50:06,783 --> 01:50:09,826
Until one day I couldn't
bear it anymore...

1195
01:50:10,305 --> 01:50:14,434
...and I left after a final salute
to those brutes.

1196
01:50:16,870 --> 01:50:19,957
I hate the British!

1197
01:50:22,217 --> 01:50:24,826
The memsahib is for us,
not against.

1198
01:50:27,435 --> 01:50:31,521
What do you know about the game?

1199
01:50:31,739 --> 01:50:34,000
Two things, memsahib.

1200
01:50:34,435 --> 01:50:39,347
When I throw the ball, it is
to shatter all three stumps.

1201
01:50:39,609 --> 01:50:44,086
And when I hit the ball,
it is to smash it to pieces.

1202
01:50:45,348 --> 01:50:47,130
That's good.

1203
01:50:47,435 --> 01:50:48,826
Deva...

1204
01:50:49,043 --> 01:50:51,827
...we saw your bowling.
Now take the bat.

1205
01:50:52,044 --> 01:50:54,521
Goli, throw the ball.

1206
01:50:55,131 --> 01:50:58,826
Goli, put away the ball.
No play until you all eat.

1207
01:50:59,305 --> 01:51:01,956
Okay, all of you come and eat.

1208
01:51:02,174 --> 01:51:03,173
Come, Deva.

1209
01:51:03,348 --> 01:51:07,565
I'm late. I must go.

1210
01:51:08,260 --> 01:51:11,522
- I'd like a word with you.
- Yes, memsahib.

1211
01:51:11,783 --> 01:51:15,087
- Bye, Gauri.
- Namaste.

1212
01:51:22,870 --> 01:51:24,739
Obstacle...!

1213
01:51:26,826 --> 01:51:28,261
Looming obstacle!

1214
01:51:32,261 --> 01:51:37,479
Bhuvan, it is difficult for me
to get out of the cantonment.

1215
01:51:38,739 --> 01:51:42,826
I can't meet you every day now.

1216
01:51:44,086 --> 01:51:45,783
Anyway...

1217
01:51:46,044 --> 01:51:49,173
...you now have the support
of your people.

1218
01:51:49,435 --> 01:51:52,956
And that is not because of me...

1219
01:51:53,174 --> 01:51:56,566
...but because of you.

1220
01:51:57,261 --> 01:51:59,000
Because...

1221
01:51:59,565 --> 01:52:02,827
...you are a good man.

1222
01:52:03,652 --> 01:52:06,348
And also a good friend.

1223
01:52:08,260 --> 01:52:10,521
You know...

1224
01:52:10,739 --> 01:52:15,870
...I've had no friends
since I was a child.

1225
01:52:18,695 --> 01:52:21,218
Until I met you.

1226
01:52:24,696 --> 01:52:26,391
I don't know...

1227
01:52:26,652 --> 01:52:30,479
...if I should say it or not...

1228
01:52:32,479 --> 01:52:33,521
...but...

1229
01:52:35,218 --> 01:52:37,566
Don't say it.
Don't say it.

1230
01:52:37,782 --> 01:52:39,522
Don't say it.

1231
01:52:45,174 --> 01:52:47,653
I'm falling in love with you.

1232
01:52:48,435 --> 01:52:52,217
Memsahib, I don't
understand English.

1233
01:52:54,130 --> 01:52:57,217
I'm falling in love with you, Bhuvan.

1234
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,435
- Where's Gauri?
- She's gone.

1235
01:53:21,696 --> 01:53:23,086
Where?

1236
01:53:23,782 --> 01:53:26,000
What are you glaring at me for?

1237
01:53:28,173 --> 01:53:30,869
What the hell have I done now?

1238
01:53:41,565 --> 01:53:42,609
Hey, Gauri!

1239
01:53:46,086 --> 01:53:49,826
I've been looking all over
for you and you're here.

1240
01:53:50,087 --> 01:53:53,086
- Why did you go off in a huff?
- Because.

1241
01:53:53,348 --> 01:53:56,913
What do you mean?
You could've at least told me.

1242
01:53:57,174 --> 01:53:58,957
How could I?

1243
01:53:59,261 --> 01:54:02,261
I could, if you could have
spared some time.

1244
01:54:02,522 --> 01:54:05,391
You flutter around her
like a pigeon.

1245
01:54:05,609 --> 01:54:08,392
You don't see anything else.

1246
01:54:08,608 --> 01:54:13,131
And today, you acted
as if I didn't exist.

1247
01:54:13,347 --> 01:54:17,653
Try to understand. She had
something important to tell me.

1248
01:54:17,869 --> 01:54:20,826
So why couldn't she say it
right there?

1249
01:54:21,043 --> 01:54:23,479
Why the need to be
alone with you?

1250
01:54:23,739 --> 01:54:27,740
You think I don't know which way
the Ganges is flowing!

1251
01:54:30,957 --> 01:54:33,478
Oh, poor me
I feel the pain

1252
01:54:35,478 --> 01:54:38,740
Of the scorpion's sting

1253
01:54:39,086 --> 01:54:40,653
You are jealous.

1254
01:54:40,869 --> 01:54:44,826
Jealous? Why should I be jealous?
It's beneath me.

1255
01:54:45,087 --> 01:54:49,000
You are jealous and I know
who you are jealous of.

1256
01:54:49,478 --> 01:54:52,347
I never want to see you again.

1257
01:54:52,608 --> 01:54:56,305
And don't you even try
to talk to me.

1258
01:54:58,391 --> 01:54:59,652
Hey, Gauri!

1259
01:54:59,870 --> 01:55:02,522
There's only one house
in the village...

1260
01:55:02,739 --> 01:55:05,043
...with a neem tree
in the yard.

1261
01:55:06,392 --> 01:55:09,434
There's also a big field beside it.

1262
01:55:10,174 --> 01:55:14,826
And a pair of oxen, two cows
and three goats too.

1263
01:55:16,174 --> 01:55:20,261
And I know whose house that is,
silly girl. It's mine!

1264
01:55:21,391 --> 01:55:23,869
One more thing before you go:

1265
01:55:24,130 --> 01:55:26,522
Mother likes you too!

1266
01:55:37,173 --> 01:55:39,131
Oh, my pretty one

1267
01:55:42,435 --> 01:55:46,522
Listen to what I have to say

1268
01:55:47,826 --> 01:55:51,305
It's only you that I love

1269
01:55:53,261 --> 01:55:56,783
What is my life without you?

1270
01:55:59,131 --> 01:56:02,391
The kajal that darkens your eyes

1271
01:56:02,609 --> 01:56:04,957
Is a cloud of dreams

1272
01:56:05,218 --> 01:56:07,696
My heart is crazy
Because of you

1273
01:56:07,914 --> 01:56:10,565
Oh, pretty one

1274
01:56:16,826 --> 01:56:18,652
Oh, my love

1275
01:56:19,435 --> 01:56:23,088
These words
Come from my heart

1276
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:34,044
It's only you that I love

1277
01:56:35,608 --> 01:56:39,739
It's only you
That I call my beloved

1278
01:56:41,261 --> 01:56:44,783
Your steady hand
Stills my fluttering veil

1279
01:56:45,044 --> 01:56:49,783
And there's turmoil in my heart
A moment I shall never forget

1280
01:56:50,827 --> 01:56:52,957
Oh, my beloved

1281
01:57:26,478 --> 01:57:31,261
My heart, it speaks a thousand words
I feel eternal bliss

1282
01:57:32,174 --> 01:57:37,043
The roses pout their scarlet mouths
Like offering a kiss

1283
01:57:37,261 --> 01:57:42,260
No drop of rain, no glowing flame
Has ever been so pure

1284
01:57:42,739 --> 01:57:47,826
If being in love can feel like this
Then I'm in love for sure

1285
01:57:53,696 --> 01:57:55,696
What lay in my heart

1286
01:57:59,001 --> 01:58:04,086
What lay hidden in my heart
Leapt to my lips today

1287
01:58:04,609 --> 01:58:07,696
An arrow resting
Somewhere in my heart

1288
01:58:07,869 --> 01:58:10,435
Has found its bow today

1289
01:58:11,434 --> 01:58:14,130
My love
For all our lives to come

1290
01:58:14,391 --> 01:58:16,783
May we remain
In this abode of love

1291
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:21,348
Our hands entwined
May we never be parted

1292
01:58:22,044 --> 01:58:25,434
I shall walk beside you
In your chosen path

1293
01:58:25,696 --> 01:58:28,522
True to your love

1294
01:59:29,827 --> 01:59:31,652
Oh, I'm in love

1295
01:59:35,653 --> 01:59:37,435
I am in love

1296
01:59:41,043 --> 01:59:43,609
Yes, I'm in love

1297
01:59:50,522 --> 01:59:52,827
Should someone ask

1298
01:59:53,869 --> 01:59:58,783
I shall tell them
What's happened to me

1299
02:00:01,609 --> 02:00:06,870
My every limb is fragrant
Because you touched me

1300
02:00:10,130 --> 02:00:13,609
Your fragrant body
Your flaming beauty

1301
02:00:13,870 --> 02:00:16,000
You are the rose I see

1302
02:00:16,218 --> 02:00:20,609
How can this allure
Not wake my desire?

1303
02:00:20,827 --> 02:00:24,479
Your beauty shines bright

1304
02:00:24,740 --> 02:00:27,479
In youth's searing light

1305
02:01:29,479 --> 02:01:32,869
Despite my warnings,
you continue to meet them!

1306
02:01:33,087 --> 02:01:37,305
- How dare you!
- I will not tolerate your nonsense!

1307
02:01:37,522 --> 02:01:40,695
Do what you like in London!
Pack your bags...

1308
02:01:40,870 --> 02:01:43,696
...and leave for England
by the next ship.

1309
02:01:43,869 --> 02:01:46,391
Let me make things clear to you.

1310
02:01:46,608 --> 02:01:50,782
Stop telling me what to do.
I'm not leaving Champaner.

1311
02:01:51,044 --> 02:01:55,478
Get this straight. I'll go to
the village as and when I wish.

1312
02:01:59,609 --> 02:02:01,174
Tell me, Eliza.

1313
02:02:01,695 --> 02:02:06,826
What's so special about them that
makes you go against your brother?

1314
02:02:07,305 --> 02:02:10,261
There's nothing special about them.

1315
02:02:10,479 --> 02:02:15,479
You're the one who's unfair.
That's why I decided to help them.

1316
02:02:15,696 --> 02:02:20,566
Do mark my words.
They'll give you a tough fight.

1317
02:02:30,696 --> 02:02:34,000
Yardley. Line and length.
Line and length.

1318
02:02:38,479 --> 02:02:39,478
How's that?

1319
02:02:40,131 --> 02:02:42,740
Good shot, Burton. Well played.

1320
02:02:58,913 --> 02:03:00,478
How was that?

1321
02:03:02,435 --> 02:03:05,870
That is out, sir.
That's the end of the day's play.

1322
02:03:06,739 --> 02:03:09,653
I'm going to announce
the batting order.

1323
02:03:09,913 --> 02:03:13,435
Smith and Burton will open,
with Smith to face.

1324
02:03:14,740 --> 02:03:17,565
Followed by myself at number three.

1325
02:03:17,870 --> 02:03:19,870
Followed by Brooks...

1326
02:03:20,478 --> 02:03:21,956
...Wesson...

1327
02:03:22,479 --> 02:03:23,826
...Noel...

1328
02:03:24,913 --> 02:03:26,522
...Benson.

1329
02:03:27,261 --> 02:03:28,826
Harrison...

1330
02:03:29,479 --> 02:03:30,696
...Flynn...

1331
02:03:31,174 --> 02:03:32,783
...Willis...

1332
02:03:33,174 --> 02:03:34,305
...Yardley.

1333
02:03:34,566 --> 02:03:35,870
Right.

1334
02:03:37,870 --> 02:03:41,566
- Who should be in the team?
- It should be Madhav.

1335
02:03:41,826 --> 02:03:44,260
What's going on?

1336
02:03:45,348 --> 02:03:48,218
Everyone wants to see you play.

1337
02:03:48,478 --> 02:03:53,696
- We haven't got our 1 1 th player.
- I'll fix it right away. Take Bhima.

1338
02:03:53,913 --> 02:03:55,956
- Bhima!
- No, Chief.

1339
02:03:56,217 --> 02:04:00,305
He may be his namesake,
but he has a backache all the time.

1340
02:04:00,522 --> 02:04:03,044
- How about Kashi Nath?
- Kashi Nath!

1341
02:04:03,304 --> 02:04:07,826
If he runs, he'll split!
Kashi this side and Nath on the other!

1342
02:04:08,304 --> 02:04:09,739
What shall we do?

1343
02:04:10,001 --> 02:04:12,826
We need a big man.
Let's wait and see.

1344
02:04:13,087 --> 02:04:14,740
Deva, you bowl.

1345
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,001
Isar Kaka, you bat.

1346
02:04:17,479 --> 02:04:20,130
All of you spread out.

1347
02:04:24,782 --> 02:04:28,870
- Bowl a little slow to Isar Kaka.
- All right.

1348
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,304
Hey, Kachra, throw the ball.

1349
02:04:57,739 --> 02:05:00,348
Stop gaping and throw it, will you?

1350
02:05:11,305 --> 02:05:12,870
What did you do?

1351
02:05:13,173 --> 02:05:15,914
I didn't do anything.
You said throw.

1352
02:05:16,826 --> 02:05:18,087
Come here.

1353
02:05:21,044 --> 02:05:22,435
Come on.

1354
02:05:22,696 --> 02:05:25,739
I didn't do anything.
You said throw.

1355
02:05:25,956 --> 02:05:27,696
Come here, all of you.

1356
02:05:27,956 --> 02:05:31,782
Eliza memsahib,
watch Kachra closely.

1357
02:05:32,217 --> 02:05:34,175
Kachra, throw it again.

1358
02:05:34,826 --> 02:05:38,088
I did no wrong. He asked me
to throw the ball.

1359
02:05:38,348 --> 02:05:39,522
Throw the ball.

1360
02:05:40,782 --> 02:05:43,521
Not with the left hand.
With the right.

1361
02:05:49,695 --> 02:05:52,566
See how it spins!

1362
02:05:53,783 --> 02:05:57,696
Amazing.
He's actually spinning the ball.

1363
02:05:57,956 --> 02:06:01,434
We have found our 1 1 th player.
Come, Kachra.

1364
02:06:01,652 --> 02:06:06,261
Isar Kaka, you'll face him.
Goli, give Kachra the ball.

1365
02:06:06,521 --> 02:06:08,304
Arjan, throw the ball.

1366
02:06:11,348 --> 02:06:12,695
What's the matter?

1367
02:06:13,391 --> 02:06:15,826
Why is everyone staring?

1368
02:06:18,435 --> 02:06:21,435
No, no.
We will not play!

1369
02:06:21,826 --> 02:06:23,956
Why?
What happened?

1370
02:06:24,739 --> 02:06:27,608
This damn untouchable!

1371
02:06:27,869 --> 02:06:30,261
Play with us?
No way!

1372
02:06:30,478 --> 02:06:32,826
He cannot play with us!

1373
02:06:33,086 --> 02:06:36,914
That's right. We will not mingle
with an untouchable.

1374
02:06:37,174 --> 02:06:41,260
This cannot be.
It's unthinkable.

1375
02:06:41,478 --> 02:06:45,218
- I am not playing.
- We too won't play.

1376
02:06:47,479 --> 02:06:51,044
What are you doing?
This is wrong.

1377
02:06:51,522 --> 02:06:55,696
You are polluting the whole system.

1378
02:06:56,174 --> 02:07:01,131
We'll fight the British.
But mingle with a low-caste, never!

1379
02:07:01,304 --> 02:07:04,391
Kachra, scram!
Get out of here!

1380
02:07:05,522 --> 02:07:07,304
Kachra.

1381
02:07:10,261 --> 02:07:12,565
Oh, my God!
He touched him!

1382
02:07:20,956 --> 02:07:24,826
You brand people untouchable
and pollute humanity.

1383
02:07:26,479 --> 02:07:30,435
You choke the air in our village
with this caste division.

1384
02:07:30,652 --> 02:07:34,478
Is it right to shatter hearts
in the name of skin colour?

1385
02:07:35,609 --> 02:07:39,826
Then why worship Ram,
who ate a tribal's half-eaten berries?

1386
02:07:40,043 --> 02:07:44,479
The Lord himself was ferried
by a low-caste boatman.

1387
02:07:44,740 --> 02:07:47,826
And yet you talk of untouchables!

1388
02:07:48,087 --> 02:07:51,131
And you, Isar Kaka?
You're a physician.

1389
02:07:51,392 --> 02:07:55,696
You check an ailing patient's pulse
and treat him.

1390
02:07:55,956 --> 02:08:00,478
Do your scriptures tell you
to let untouchables die?

1391
02:08:02,260 --> 02:08:06,956
If that is so, then that is
the gravest crime on humanity.

1392
02:08:07,174 --> 02:08:11,565
After today, no one will regard
a physician as God's other form!

1393
02:08:13,913 --> 02:08:16,609
You wanted a
strong player, right?

1394
02:08:16,826 --> 02:08:19,261
Kachra is a cripple.

1395
02:08:19,522 --> 02:08:24,261
Your hands aren't deformed.
It's by God's grace you can say this.

1396
02:08:24,478 --> 02:08:29,305
But the man you call a cripple
will be our greatest strength.

1397
02:08:29,566 --> 02:08:32,608
This lifeless hand
will lead us to victory.

1398
02:08:33,218 --> 02:08:36,391
Let me remind you all of one thing.

1399
02:08:36,653 --> 02:08:41,608
This is not a game we are
playing for fun and entertainment.

1400
02:08:41,870 --> 02:08:44,695
This is a battle we must win!

1401
02:08:44,957 --> 02:08:49,086
Our goal is freedom from lagaan
and welfare for our village.

1402
02:08:49,304 --> 02:08:51,913
And for that I will remain unbowed!

1403
02:08:52,173 --> 02:08:56,566
Whether you support me or not,
Kachra will play.

1404
02:09:10,957 --> 02:09:12,827
Bhuvan, my son.

1405
02:09:13,565 --> 02:09:16,565
Shame cannot enter eyes...

1406
02:09:16,740 --> 02:09:19,696
...that are fully open.

1407
02:09:20,783 --> 02:09:23,695
I agree with Isar Bhai.

1408
02:09:23,957 --> 02:09:25,956
You are right.

1409
02:09:33,782 --> 02:09:35,957
Kachra will play with us.

1410
02:11:55,347 --> 02:11:59,174
Over and over
Say this, my friend

1411
02:12:00,348 --> 02:12:04,261
May victory be ours
And defeat their lot

1412
02:12:05,348 --> 02:12:09,435
Over and over
Say this, my friend

1413
02:12:10,305 --> 02:12:13,783
May victory be ours
And defeat theirs

1414
02:12:15,391 --> 02:12:17,609
Let no one win against us

1415
02:12:17,826 --> 02:12:20,000
Let's walk on
Let's walk on

1416
02:12:20,217 --> 02:12:22,565
All who challenge us
Will perish

1417
02:12:22,826 --> 02:12:24,869
Let's walk on

1418
02:12:25,087 --> 02:12:27,870
Even if it is pitch dark

1419
02:12:28,043 --> 02:12:30,044
Let's walk on
Let's walk on

1420
02:12:30,304 --> 02:12:32,609
Let no one lag behind

1421
02:12:32,870 --> 02:12:34,174
Let's walk on

1422
02:12:35,782 --> 02:12:38,130
Should one finger rise

1423
02:12:38,305 --> 02:12:40,566
It shall break

1424
02:12:40,739 --> 02:12:42,826
When five fingers join

1425
02:12:43,305 --> 02:12:45,217
They form a fist

1426
02:12:45,391 --> 02:12:50,392
Let our unity grow
Come on, walk on

1427
02:12:50,783 --> 02:12:53,174
However seductive the lure

1428
02:12:53,434 --> 02:12:55,304
Walk on

1429
02:12:55,652 --> 02:12:58,174
Let no one win against us

1430
02:12:58,391 --> 02:13:00,479
Let's walk on
Let's walk on

1431
02:13:00,739 --> 02:13:03,087
All who challenge us
Will perish

1432
02:13:03,305 --> 02:13:05,739
Walk on

1433
02:13:41,957 --> 02:13:44,566
Let no one stop you
Obstruct you

1434
02:13:44,782 --> 02:13:47,739
Break all barriers

1435
02:13:48,304 --> 02:13:52,826
What do you get from being
Weak and powerless?

1436
02:13:53,086 --> 02:13:55,087
May we never suffer again

1437
02:13:55,304 --> 02:13:58,609
So great shall be our play
The enemy will lose

1438
02:13:59,696 --> 02:14:03,348
We will now take
The path of courage

1439
02:14:04,565 --> 02:14:06,870
We will shake up this earth

1440
02:14:07,174 --> 02:14:09,261
We will show everyone

1441
02:14:09,565 --> 02:14:11,783
Who is king
Who is slave

1442
02:14:14,957 --> 02:14:18,217
We will show this world

1443
02:14:19,478 --> 02:14:22,000
What we are worth

1444
02:14:24,305 --> 02:14:28,304
Over and over
Say this, my friend

1445
02:14:29,565 --> 02:14:33,566
May victory be ours
And defeat theirs

1446
02:14:34,565 --> 02:14:37,043
No fear will enter our hearts

1447
02:14:37,304 --> 02:14:39,131
Let's walk on

1448
02:14:39,348 --> 02:14:42,000
Every shackle
Will now break open

1449
02:14:42,173 --> 02:14:43,609
Let's walk on

1450
02:15:40,653 --> 02:15:43,956
Keep walking
Don't ever falter

1451
02:15:44,174 --> 02:15:46,739
You are the journeyman
Of the road

1452
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:50,652
May you never be weary

1453
02:15:52,305 --> 02:15:54,783
He that rules you
Is a tyrant

1454
02:15:55,479 --> 02:15:57,913
He that has destroyed us

1455
02:15:58,173 --> 02:16:00,174
His home is in the West

1456
02:16:00,434 --> 02:16:03,348
We will make sure
He will not remain

1457
02:16:03,608 --> 02:16:07,869
We will shake up this earth
We will show everyone

1458
02:16:08,087 --> 02:16:10,739
Who is king
Who is slave

1459
02:16:13,347 --> 02:16:17,348
We shall show this world

1460
02:16:18,174 --> 02:16:20,522
What we are worth

1461
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,652
What has to happen
Will happen

1462
02:16:25,870 --> 02:16:27,695
Let's walk on

1463
02:16:27,957 --> 02:16:30,696
May no one bow his head

1464
02:16:30,869 --> 02:16:32,609
Let's walk on

1465
02:17:55,827 --> 02:17:59,044
And then the historic day dawned...

1466
02:17:59,261 --> 02:18:03,653
...when the first rays of the sun
fell on the cricket field.

1467
02:18:59,131 --> 02:19:01,174
Morning, Captain Russell.

1468
02:19:01,435 --> 02:19:05,130
- Morning, Colonel Boyer. This way.
- Thank you.

1469
02:19:11,913 --> 02:19:13,913
Morning, Miss Russell.

1470
02:19:16,696 --> 02:19:20,565
- Hope you're confident, captain.
- Yes, sir.

1471
02:19:21,087 --> 02:19:22,957
Decent crowd.

1472
02:19:50,696 --> 02:19:53,305
Hail Almighty!

1473
02:20:24,740 --> 02:20:27,304
Long live Your Highness!

1474
02:20:28,435 --> 02:20:31,435
Smash these foreigners!

1475
02:20:31,957 --> 02:20:34,174
Beat them to a pulp!

1476
02:20:35,653 --> 02:20:39,261
Crush Captain Russell's arrogance!

1477
02:20:40,262 --> 02:20:42,522
Long live Your Highness!

1478
02:20:47,392 --> 02:20:50,827
- Things are beginning to hot up a bit.
- Yes.

1479
02:20:51,043 --> 02:20:54,913
Both teams will bat only once.

1480
02:20:55,131 --> 02:20:57,827
The game will be played
over three days.

1481
02:20:58,044 --> 02:21:01,783
Which team gets to bat first...

1482
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:05,565
...will be decided by
the toss of a coin.

1483
02:21:05,783 --> 02:21:10,609
For this, both the teams
must enter the field.

1484
02:21:39,783 --> 02:21:42,348
To ensure fair play...

1485
02:21:42,608 --> 02:21:47,740
...senior officials invited
neutral umpires from Kanpur.

1486
02:21:49,044 --> 02:21:52,827
- Will you call, Captain Russell?
- Heads, sir.

1487
02:21:57,434 --> 02:21:59,652
Heads. Your call.

1488
02:21:59,870 --> 02:22:01,783
We will bat.

1489
02:22:02,043 --> 02:22:05,044
- Good luck, captain.
- Thank you, sir.

1490
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,043
Good luck, young man.

1491
02:22:21,522 --> 02:22:25,739
The team that scores
the most runs...

1492
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,260
...wins the game.

1493
02:22:28,478 --> 02:22:32,348
Opening the batting for
the English team...

1494
02:22:32,826 --> 02:22:36,957
...are Lt. Smith and Lt. Burton.

1495
02:22:50,174 --> 02:22:53,869
- Middle stump please, umpire.
- A little to leg.

1496
02:22:54,347 --> 02:22:56,130
That's it.

1497
02:23:18,783 --> 02:23:20,739
What are they doing?

1498
02:23:34,391 --> 02:23:36,304
Well done!

1499
02:23:36,522 --> 02:23:38,261
Come here, all of you!

1500
02:23:39,175 --> 02:23:40,565
Come here!

1501
02:23:42,956 --> 02:23:44,739
What are you doing?

1502
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,435
All running at the same time!

1503
02:23:47,695 --> 02:23:52,218
You run after the ball only if
it comes toward you. Got it?

1504
02:23:53,130 --> 02:23:54,739
Now go.

1505
02:24:02,391 --> 02:24:04,348
Well done, Bhura!

1506
02:24:18,957 --> 02:24:21,695
The ball crosses the boundary...

1507
02:24:21,956 --> 02:24:25,566
...and the English get
four more runs.

1508
02:24:30,696 --> 02:24:31,827
No ball!

1509
02:24:35,913 --> 02:24:37,478
No ball!

1510
02:24:37,913 --> 02:24:39,478
What's he saying?

1511
02:24:40,261 --> 02:24:41,391
No ball!

1512
02:24:43,521 --> 02:24:45,174
Steady, Smith. Steady.

1513
02:24:45,913 --> 02:24:48,653
Deva crossed the line
while bowling...

1514
02:24:48,913 --> 02:24:51,913
...so the batsman
was declared not out.

1515
02:24:52,174 --> 02:24:55,000
Instead, he got an extra run.

1516
02:24:58,392 --> 02:25:00,000
Damn!
He made me run.

1517
02:25:06,131 --> 02:25:07,913
That's over.

1518
02:25:08,479 --> 02:25:12,131
That brings us to
the end of Deva's over.

1519
02:25:12,392 --> 02:25:14,478
Eight runs were made.

1520
02:25:14,695 --> 02:25:18,956
Now a new bowler will bowl.

1521
02:25:23,130 --> 02:25:27,087
A little forward.
The ball will spin. Catch it.

1522
02:25:33,739 --> 02:25:35,000
One.

1523
02:25:39,391 --> 02:25:41,087
Kachra, spin it.

1524
02:25:46,305 --> 02:25:48,130
Oh, shot, Burton.

1525
02:26:14,087 --> 02:26:18,653
- Why isn't the ball spinning?
- I don't know.

1526
02:26:35,131 --> 02:26:37,348
Catch it, Lakha!

1527
02:27:00,348 --> 02:27:03,434
Kachra isn't spinning the ball
at all today.

1528
02:27:03,652 --> 02:27:05,565
He has to be taken off.

1529
02:27:05,783 --> 02:27:08,826
- Deva, you rest a while too.
- Okay.

1530
02:27:09,739 --> 02:27:13,826
- Bhuvan, you bowl.
- Okay.

1531
02:27:27,218 --> 02:27:28,522
Throw!

1532
02:27:28,740 --> 02:27:30,044
No, no, no!

1533
02:27:35,392 --> 02:27:38,218
The first English batsman is out!

1534
02:27:52,478 --> 02:27:54,739
Looking forward to this.

1535
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:56,565
Bad luck, Smith.

1536
02:27:57,478 --> 02:27:59,869
Coming in to bat now...

1537
02:28:00,087 --> 02:28:04,087
...the English captain,
Captain Russell!

1538
02:28:38,088 --> 02:28:40,565
Sharp fielding there!

1539
02:28:42,174 --> 02:28:43,173
Well done!

1540
02:28:43,435 --> 02:28:47,391
For the loss of one wicket,
they have scored 66 runs.

1541
02:28:47,652 --> 02:28:50,999
- Shatter the sticks, Goli.
- Of course.

1542
02:28:51,609 --> 02:28:54,131
Right arm from this side.

1543
02:28:54,348 --> 02:28:57,043
Right arm over the wicket.

1544
02:29:09,217 --> 02:29:11,000
Very good, Goli.

1545
02:29:13,175 --> 02:29:16,695
- Sir, did you see that?
- Yes, I did.

1546
02:29:16,913 --> 02:29:18,608
Excellent, Goli.

1547
02:29:27,783 --> 02:29:29,566
This is ridiculous!

1548
02:29:29,826 --> 02:29:33,391
Sir, you cannot bowl like this.
It's improper.

1549
02:29:33,652 --> 02:29:34,783
What is it?

1550
02:29:35,001 --> 02:29:38,739
- He can't bowl like this.
- Why not?

1551
02:29:43,043 --> 02:29:44,565
What's wrong, sahib?

1552
02:29:48,435 --> 02:29:53,174
- Have you ever seen such an action?
- Is something the matter?

1553
02:29:53,435 --> 02:29:58,174
This man swings his arm more
than once before releasing the ball.

1554
02:29:58,435 --> 02:30:00,652
He must bowl conventionally.

1555
02:30:00,913 --> 02:30:04,956
- Sir, that's unfair to the home team.
- Unfair?

1556
02:30:05,174 --> 02:30:09,000
It's only fair they ask this man
to bowl properly.

1557
02:30:09,261 --> 02:30:14,217
There is no rule written
about such an action. Is there?

1558
02:30:14,435 --> 02:30:18,392
There's nothing written
about it that I can recall.

1559
02:30:20,043 --> 02:30:23,174
There is nothing written
about this rule.

1560
02:30:23,347 --> 02:30:28,479
We'd better write some rules,
captain, but only after this match.

1561
02:30:28,739 --> 02:30:30,870
Let's get on with the match.

1562
02:30:31,130 --> 02:30:34,174
Okay, he is permitted to bowl.

1563
02:30:38,348 --> 02:30:42,131
To kill a tiger or a cheetah,
that is nothing!

1564
02:30:42,348 --> 02:30:46,131
Kill these tyrants!
Thrash these whites! Defeat them!

1565
02:30:46,392 --> 02:30:49,218
Come on! Throw the ball!
Break the stick!

1566
02:30:58,870 --> 02:31:01,087
For goodness' sake!

1567
02:31:17,348 --> 02:31:20,260
Look at his arm action.
It's ridiculous.

1568
02:31:20,653 --> 02:31:22,609
Dangerous too.

1569
02:31:26,566 --> 02:31:30,261
The next batsman is Lt. Brooks!

1570
02:31:33,434 --> 02:31:35,086
Two, please.

1571
02:31:36,391 --> 02:31:37,695
Thank you.

1572
02:31:50,608 --> 02:31:51,782
Brooks.

1573
02:31:52,348 --> 02:31:53,826
Sir.

1574
02:31:56,696 --> 02:32:00,913
Just before he releases the ball,
he makes a grunting noise.

1575
02:32:01,130 --> 02:32:03,000
Something like this:

1576
02:32:04,044 --> 02:32:07,392
- Listen for it.
- Right, sir. Thank you.

1577
02:32:07,609 --> 02:32:09,261
Well done, Goli.

1578
02:32:28,086 --> 02:32:29,913
Good timing!

1579
02:32:39,435 --> 02:32:43,696
For the loss of two wickets,
they have made 1 32 runs.

1580
02:32:43,956 --> 02:32:48,522
Captain Russell is on 38
and Lt. Brooks on 32.

1581
02:32:52,218 --> 02:32:54,087
Catch it, Bagha!

1582
02:33:29,435 --> 02:33:33,914
I don't think W.G. Grace could have
made such confident strokes.

1583
02:33:43,260 --> 02:33:45,565
What are you doing, Lakha?

1584
02:33:45,826 --> 02:33:47,478
I missed it, Kaka.

1585
02:33:48,522 --> 02:33:52,653
How could you miss it, son?
Where's your concentration?

1586
02:33:52,913 --> 02:33:56,869
We have to win. We must win.
Please concentrate.

1587
02:33:57,087 --> 02:33:59,130
Go on, Bhuvan.
Very good!

1588
02:34:17,653 --> 02:34:20,305
The end of the day's play, gentlemen.

1589
02:34:21,827 --> 02:34:24,913
The English team has scored
1 82 runs...

1590
02:34:25,174 --> 02:34:27,522
...for the loss of two wickets.

1591
02:34:27,783 --> 02:34:32,392
And with this, we come to
the end of the first day's play.

1592
02:34:32,609 --> 02:34:35,391
Our game wasn't good today.

1593
02:34:36,217 --> 02:34:41,087
What happened to you, Lakha?
You played so well during practise.

1594
02:34:41,304 --> 02:34:45,435
Practise is a different thing.
We play among ourselves.

1595
02:34:45,913 --> 02:34:48,565
Why are you blaming only me?

1596
02:34:48,870 --> 02:34:53,391
You all went gaga over Kachra.
Did you see his miracle today?

1597
02:34:53,652 --> 02:34:58,088
- I told you before...
- At least he tried. You didn't!

1598
02:34:58,304 --> 02:35:02,522
- What did he do with all that trying?
- Shut up, Lakha!

1599
02:35:22,696 --> 02:35:26,914
That night Elizabeth saw
a shadowy figure.

1600
02:35:29,457 --> 02:35:31,717
She tried to investigate.

1601
02:35:31,935 --> 02:35:34,326
My being in the team helped.

1602
02:35:34,804 --> 02:35:38,022
She was stunned to see Lakha there.

1603
02:35:45,892 --> 02:35:50,892
She went to the village at once
and informed Bhuvan about Lakha.

1604
02:35:59,544 --> 02:36:01,196
l...

1605
02:36:07,934 --> 02:36:10,761
What I did was very wrong.

1606
02:36:13,978 --> 02:36:15,587
Forgive me.

1607
02:36:15,805 --> 02:36:17,457
Lakha!

1608
02:36:17,935 --> 02:36:20,804
A snake like you should be crushed!

1609
02:36:50,283 --> 02:36:51,283
Stop!

1610
02:36:57,326 --> 02:36:58,804
Stop!

1611
02:36:59,021 --> 02:37:02,891
- Drag him out, Bhuvan!
- We'll kill him!

1612
02:37:06,369 --> 02:37:08,152
Calm down, all of you!

1613
02:37:08,414 --> 02:37:10,413
I'll talk to him.

1614
02:37:11,239 --> 02:37:12,718
Lakha!

1615
02:37:13,109 --> 02:37:15,805
- Lakha, open the door!
- No, Bhuvan.

1616
02:37:15,978 --> 02:37:19,195
I won't open the door.
They'll kill me!

1617
02:37:19,457 --> 02:37:23,108
- I won't open it.
- Nobody will do anything.

1618
02:37:23,370 --> 02:37:26,935
How long will you stay inside?
They won't budge.

1619
02:37:27,153 --> 02:37:30,413
Open the door and let me in.

1620
02:37:39,022 --> 02:37:41,065
I made a mistake, Bhuvan.

1621
02:37:41,935 --> 02:37:44,370
Forgive me.

1622
02:37:50,587 --> 02:37:53,283
Why did you do it, Lakha?

1623
02:37:56,196 --> 02:37:58,978
I lost my mind, Bhuvan.

1624
02:38:01,848 --> 02:38:03,761
Because...

1625
02:38:06,587 --> 02:38:09,586
...l was in love with Gauri.

1626
02:38:10,760 --> 02:38:14,587
I wanted her to be mine
at any cost.

1627
02:38:16,370 --> 02:38:19,109
But she loves you.

1628
02:38:19,370 --> 02:38:23,761
And I hated you for that!
I hated you for that!

1629
02:38:24,369 --> 02:38:27,544
I wanted you to lose.
To be disgraced...

1630
02:38:27,804 --> 02:38:30,891
...before Gauri
and the whole village!

1631
02:38:33,239 --> 02:38:37,413
You risked the lives of
everyone in the village.

1632
02:38:37,674 --> 02:38:40,066
You put their future at stake!

1633
02:38:41,370 --> 02:38:44,673
Do you know what you
have done, Lakha?

1634
02:38:44,935 --> 02:38:47,457
Save me, Bhuvan.
Save me.

1635
02:38:48,456 --> 02:38:50,283
Just one chance.

1636
02:38:50,847 --> 02:38:54,630
Give me a chance to repent.
Just one chance.

1637
02:38:54,892 --> 02:38:57,369
I'll do whatever you say.

1638
02:38:57,631 --> 02:39:02,370
But give me just
one more chance to repent.

1639
02:39:03,239 --> 02:39:05,500
I can give you one chance.

1640
02:39:07,240 --> 02:39:10,066
But you must prove your loyalty.

1641
02:39:10,978 --> 02:39:12,805
If you cannot...

1642
02:39:13,935 --> 02:39:16,761
...you will not find refuge
even here.

1643
02:39:29,413 --> 02:39:32,195
The second day's play begins...

1644
02:39:32,456 --> 02:39:34,631
...with the score at 1 82.

1645
02:39:34,934 --> 02:39:39,456
Hail the Great Guru's warriors.
Hail the Great Guru's victory.

1646
02:40:19,760 --> 02:40:23,457
The new batsman is Lt. Wesson.

1647
02:41:04,543 --> 02:41:06,153
Well batted, sir.

1648
02:41:06,369 --> 02:41:09,326
- Rather enjoyable knock.
- Lovely to watch.

1649
02:41:20,108 --> 02:41:22,979
Oh, great shot, sir!
Well played!

1650
02:41:23,195 --> 02:41:26,805
- Let's have more of those.
- Congratulations, Wesson.

1651
02:41:27,022 --> 02:41:29,544
And that's lunch, gentlemen.

1652
02:41:34,240 --> 02:41:40,152
- 271 for 3 is an extremely good score.
- We'll be looking at at least 600.

1653
02:41:40,326 --> 02:41:42,717
Something to please the crowd.

1654
02:41:43,326 --> 02:41:45,239
Steady.

1655
02:41:54,109 --> 02:42:00,978
Bhuvan, if they continue
to bat like this...

1656
02:42:04,413 --> 02:42:07,327
You'll have to do something.

1657
02:42:08,196 --> 02:42:09,848
Yes, memsahib.

1658
02:42:11,326 --> 02:42:15,196
We've tried all our bowlers.

1659
02:42:17,196 --> 02:42:19,848
I don't know what to do.

1660
02:42:48,065 --> 02:42:49,630
Over.

1661
02:42:59,934 --> 02:43:01,544
What did you do?

1662
02:43:03,935 --> 02:43:06,022
Come here. Come on!

1663
02:43:09,326 --> 02:43:12,152
What's this?
He's bowling again!

1664
02:43:12,369 --> 02:43:15,717
- I don't understand.
- Crazy chap.

1665
02:43:27,283 --> 02:43:28,848
Well done!

1666
02:43:41,500 --> 02:43:45,239
Goodness gracious!
The ball turned almost three feet!

1667
02:44:01,935 --> 02:44:03,978
Catch it, Bhura!

1668
02:44:27,065 --> 02:44:30,065
Gentlemen, he's on a hat trick.

1669
02:44:49,283 --> 02:44:51,544
He's done it, by George!

1670
02:45:11,195 --> 02:45:15,717
From 295 for 3,
they are now 295 for 6!

1671
02:45:15,979 --> 02:45:20,848
Hail Almighty!
Break the enemy's back!

1672
02:45:44,282 --> 02:45:45,891
Good shot, Harrison!

1673
02:45:49,935 --> 02:45:53,848
So you step out and hit, do you?
Try coming out now!

1674
02:46:03,456 --> 02:46:08,239
Go home! Go back home
with your tail between your legs!

1675
02:46:08,500 --> 02:46:12,892
May the mighty hands of Fate
ruin you! Vultures!

1676
02:46:29,631 --> 02:46:32,022
Catch it, Bagha!

1677
02:46:34,457 --> 02:46:37,935
- Catch it, Bagha.
- Catch it, Bagha.

1678
02:46:50,978 --> 02:46:52,848
You caught it!

1679
02:47:16,717 --> 02:47:21,630
The score is 320 with only
two batsmen left!

1680
02:47:32,717 --> 02:47:35,544
- Arjan!
- Arjan, don't drop it!

1681
02:48:04,978 --> 02:48:06,674
Come on, Deva.

1682
02:48:39,196 --> 02:48:44,196
With the last batsman out,
the English innings are over.

1683
02:48:46,587 --> 02:48:49,847
The Champaner team
will have to make...

1684
02:48:50,065 --> 02:48:52,631
...323 runs to win.

1685
02:48:52,891 --> 02:48:55,500
They collapsed
like a house of cards.

1686
02:48:55,760 --> 02:48:59,457
- That's a huge mountain to climb.
- Absolutely.

1687
02:48:59,718 --> 02:49:03,239
- Come on, brothers!
- Get rid of lagaan!

1688
02:49:03,456 --> 02:49:07,544
- Come on, brothers!
- Get rid of lagaan!

1689
02:49:12,501 --> 02:49:16,021
That was simply great!

1690
02:49:16,282 --> 02:49:19,674
Kachra's magic worked.
The whites just crumbled.

1691
02:49:19,935 --> 02:49:24,631
I felt Bhuvan was making
a big mistake by bringing you on.

1692
02:49:24,848 --> 02:49:26,326
But he bowled well.

1693
02:49:26,544 --> 02:49:29,500
The foolish whites
only looked in front.

1694
02:49:29,761 --> 02:49:34,413
And the ball whizzed past their butts
and knocked the bails off!

1695
02:49:34,978 --> 02:49:38,022
All this joking is fine.
But think how...

1696
02:49:38,283 --> 02:49:41,109
...you will make these 323 runs.

1697
02:49:41,327 --> 02:49:43,109
It'll be done, Chief.

1698
02:49:43,327 --> 02:49:45,065
Listen, all of you.

1699
02:49:45,631 --> 02:49:50,109
Ismail, Lakha, Bagha,
Deva and Arjan.

1700
02:49:50,327 --> 02:49:54,240
The six of us are responsible
for making those 323 runs.

1701
02:49:54,500 --> 02:49:57,543
The others are weak in batting.

1702
02:49:57,761 --> 02:50:02,587
The six of us must bat
cautiously and calmly.

1703
02:50:02,805 --> 02:50:07,196
Deva, you and I will
open the batting.

1704
02:50:07,674 --> 02:50:11,370
We will hang in there
till the end of play today.

1705
02:50:11,630 --> 02:50:13,239
Okay, brother.

1706
02:51:14,413 --> 02:51:16,196
Careful, Bhuvan.

1707
02:51:16,892 --> 02:51:18,892
Steady, Bhuvan, steady.

1708
02:51:19,804 --> 02:51:21,631
What are you doing?

1709
02:51:22,848 --> 02:51:24,848
Get ahold of yourself.

1710
02:52:24,891 --> 02:52:29,587
The people of the village
get four more runs with this!

1711
02:52:41,978 --> 02:52:45,413
All right, Ram Singh.
All right.

1712
02:52:53,761 --> 02:52:57,282
- Come on, brothers!
- Let's get rid of lagaan!

1713
02:53:29,935 --> 02:53:33,588
- How could this happen?
- Don't forget the crease.

1714
02:53:35,500 --> 02:53:37,196
Very bad luck.

1715
02:53:48,762 --> 02:53:52,152
Who's next?
Arjan!

1716
02:53:52,718 --> 02:53:55,978
Teach those arrogant whites
a lesson!

1717
02:53:56,240 --> 02:54:00,065
- Just stay there until dusk.
- Careful.

1718
02:54:33,152 --> 02:54:36,327
Well done, Arjan.
But be careful.

1719
02:54:43,935 --> 02:54:46,761
You won't have a morsel to eat.

1720
02:54:48,109 --> 02:54:50,935
Nor a piece of cloth to wear.

1721
02:54:51,196 --> 02:54:55,674
They are trying to needle you, Arjan.
Stay calm.

1722
02:54:59,413 --> 02:55:04,066
You won't have a morsel to eat
nor a piece of cloth to wear.

1723
02:55:15,761 --> 02:55:16,979
Careful, Arjan!

1724
02:55:17,805 --> 02:55:22,196
Triple lagaan. We will take
triple lagaan from you.

1725
02:55:22,500 --> 02:55:25,935
They are trying to provoke you.
Stay calm.

1726
02:55:26,195 --> 02:55:30,761
You damn slaves will remain crushed
under our boots!

1727
02:55:31,065 --> 02:55:34,066
Careful, Arjan.
Stay calm.

1728
02:55:40,239 --> 02:55:43,066
Catch it. Catch it!

1729
02:55:44,848 --> 02:55:46,326
Yes!

1730
02:55:52,196 --> 02:55:53,848
Over.

1731
02:56:26,022 --> 02:56:27,457
Yardley.

1732
02:56:28,804 --> 02:56:31,413
Knock his bloody head off.

1733
02:57:05,240 --> 02:57:08,544
- Good sport, Yardley.
- That was a nasty one.

1734
02:58:16,543 --> 02:58:19,413
He's got some strength
in those arms!

1735
02:58:19,587 --> 02:58:23,761
Bagha, please be careful.
Don't get carried away.

1736
02:58:30,979 --> 02:58:32,761
Oh, well bowled!

1737
02:58:51,978 --> 02:58:53,631
Go, my son.

1738
02:59:00,152 --> 02:59:01,892
And again, Yardley.

1739
02:59:02,934 --> 02:59:04,847
Careful, Ismail.

1740
02:59:07,934 --> 02:59:11,153
- Good, Yardley.
- Very good bowl.

1741
02:59:11,413 --> 02:59:12,543
What happened?

1742
02:59:13,717 --> 02:59:14,761
Hurry!

1743
02:59:14,978 --> 02:59:17,109
That must have hurt.

1744
02:59:19,457 --> 02:59:21,978
Take him away.
Don't worry.

1745
02:59:22,500 --> 02:59:24,674
Careful, Ismail.

1746
02:59:30,152 --> 02:59:32,370
- Is he badly hurt?
- Yes.

1747
02:59:52,978 --> 02:59:54,935
Thank God!

1748
02:59:55,153 --> 02:59:58,761
- That was close.
- It certainly was, Your Highness.

1749
02:59:58,978 --> 03:00:00,934
End of day's play.

1750
03:00:01,196 --> 03:00:05,543
Great bowling, Yardley. Well bowled.
We've got them on the run.

1751
03:01:03,066 --> 03:01:06,326
We've lost five of our best batsmen.

1752
03:01:07,152 --> 03:01:08,935
What will we do now?

1753
03:01:26,282 --> 03:01:29,239
O Saviour

1754
03:01:32,108 --> 03:01:36,587
O Pure of Essence
Our Dearly Beloved

1755
03:02:00,891 --> 03:02:03,412
O Saviour

1756
03:02:03,717 --> 03:02:06,326
O Pure of Essence

1757
03:02:06,587 --> 03:02:11,153
We have no one but You

1758
03:02:15,369 --> 03:02:20,456
Ease our troubles
O Lord

1759
03:02:21,195 --> 03:02:25,240
We have no one but You

1760
03:02:29,761 --> 03:02:34,456
You alone are
Our sole support

1761
03:02:35,805 --> 03:02:40,196
You alone are our Protector

1762
03:02:41,240 --> 03:02:45,369
We have no one but You

1763
03:02:53,022 --> 03:02:56,848
We have no one but You

1764
03:03:13,196 --> 03:03:17,892
You have filled the moon
With light

1765
03:03:21,500 --> 03:03:25,631
The sun shines
Only because of You

1766
03:03:29,804 --> 03:03:34,543
Your splendour
Lights the sky with stars

1767
03:03:41,718 --> 03:03:43,804
O Lord

1768
03:03:44,195 --> 03:03:47,674
If not you

1769
03:03:47,935 --> 03:03:53,152
Who will preserve this life?

1770
03:03:53,935 --> 03:03:58,544
O Saviour
O Pure of Essence

1771
03:03:59,369 --> 03:04:04,240
We have no one but You

1772
03:04:34,152 --> 03:04:39,065
If you would hear us

1773
03:04:39,283 --> 03:04:42,717
O Lord
We make this plea

1774
03:04:42,978 --> 03:04:48,109
Grant the suffering courage
May hardship never defeat them

1775
03:04:48,326 --> 03:04:50,934
To the weak
Give Your protection

1776
03:04:51,196 --> 03:04:53,673
So they may live in peace

1777
03:04:53,978 --> 03:04:55,718
To devotion

1778
03:04:56,978 --> 03:04:58,891
Give strength

1779
03:05:05,544 --> 03:05:09,978
You are the Lord of the universe

1780
03:05:11,152 --> 03:05:13,456
Listen to this plea

1781
03:05:16,891 --> 03:05:20,413
When the path is dark

1782
03:05:22,891 --> 03:05:27,456
Give us the boon of light

1783
03:05:29,501 --> 03:05:31,501
O Saviour

1784
03:05:32,065 --> 03:05:34,588
O Pure of Essence

1785
03:05:35,109 --> 03:05:38,631
We have no one but You

1786
03:05:40,761 --> 03:05:44,282
Ease our troubles
O Lord

1787
03:05:46,805 --> 03:05:50,326
We have no one but You

1788
03:06:49,978 --> 03:06:52,804
Bhuvan has reached his 50!

1789
03:06:57,588 --> 03:07:02,587
That must be the first 50 in the
history of Indian village cricket.

1790
03:07:05,762 --> 03:07:08,239
Come on, run!

1791
03:07:08,544 --> 03:07:13,022
And with this, Isar Kaka
completes 1 0 runs!

1792
03:07:13,326 --> 03:07:15,891
- Very good!
- Well done.

1793
03:07:54,501 --> 03:07:56,369
One more!

1794
03:08:22,934 --> 03:08:25,152
I lost, Bhuvan.

1795
03:08:28,369 --> 03:08:30,369
I couldn't run.

1796
03:08:31,283 --> 03:08:33,283
Couldn't run.

1797
03:08:34,848 --> 03:08:36,848
It was my fault.

1798
03:08:39,630 --> 03:08:41,848
I couldn't run.

1799
03:08:48,630 --> 03:08:51,196
"Tormentors of the weak! Beware!

1800
03:08:51,457 --> 03:08:55,065
The sighs of the oppressed
turn iron to ashes."

1801
03:08:55,327 --> 03:08:57,457
Keep the flag flying, Guran!

1802
03:09:05,500 --> 03:09:07,892
He's coming from the jungle.

1803
03:09:11,195 --> 03:09:13,935
- Stand back!
- Make way, make way!

1804
03:09:14,196 --> 03:09:16,239
Watch yourself.

1805
03:09:16,457 --> 03:09:20,283
- What on earth is he doing?
- This way, sir.

1806
03:09:23,935 --> 03:09:28,196
What an extraordinary stance.
As if he's riding a horse.

1807
03:09:34,457 --> 03:09:35,847
Hari Om!

1808
03:09:40,196 --> 03:09:41,675
Well struck, sir!

1809
03:09:41,891 --> 03:09:45,674
Umpire, he can't do that.
It's not cricket.

1810
03:09:45,934 --> 03:09:47,326
Guran...

1811
03:09:47,717 --> 03:09:50,326
-...hit the ball just once.
- Okay.

1812
03:09:51,196 --> 03:09:52,848
Hail Almighty!

1813
03:09:53,066 --> 03:09:56,065
That's called kicking the horse.

1814
03:09:57,718 --> 03:10:01,065
- Run!
- Break the enemy's back.

1815
03:10:03,283 --> 03:10:05,021
Over.

1816
03:10:05,587 --> 03:10:10,456
Here he comes, Bhuvan.
Hit him hard!

1817
03:10:11,457 --> 03:10:12,935
Great!

1818
03:10:18,327 --> 03:10:20,673
Throw to the bowler's end!

1819
03:10:22,588 --> 03:10:24,631
Come on, white man!

1820
03:10:39,239 --> 03:10:42,326
Rot in hell!

1821
03:10:45,370 --> 03:10:46,978
One more, Guran!

1822
03:10:47,196 --> 03:10:50,065
I'll make you whine for your ma!

1823
03:10:55,544 --> 03:10:58,892
So what does your ma say now?

1824
03:11:03,370 --> 03:11:07,761
Hail Almighty!
Come on, white man!

1825
03:11:12,413 --> 03:11:14,239
Why are you shouting?

1826
03:11:14,457 --> 03:11:15,891
Yes! Good ball.

1827
03:11:16,109 --> 03:11:18,196
Damn you!

1828
03:11:31,326 --> 03:11:34,457
Goli, my son, hang in there.

1829
03:11:34,675 --> 03:11:37,414
Only Bhura and Kachra
are after you.

1830
03:11:37,674 --> 03:11:40,153
- Father, hang in there.
- Hit hard!

1831
03:11:40,370 --> 03:11:42,587
Do us proud!

1832
03:11:42,847 --> 03:11:45,718
Don't scare him, idiots!
Hang in there!

1833
03:11:49,065 --> 03:11:51,369
Steady, Goli!

1834
03:11:52,240 --> 03:11:54,456
Come on, Willis.
He's nervous.

1835
03:12:12,153 --> 03:12:17,979
- Out the first ball.
- Bhura...wait. I'll go.

1836
03:12:18,152 --> 03:12:21,153
- In this condition?
- Yes.

1837
03:12:23,674 --> 03:12:26,370
- Oh, my goodness.
- Interesting.

1838
03:12:28,153 --> 03:12:30,978
They're giving you
your hat trick, Willis.

1839
03:12:32,109 --> 03:12:35,108
But how will you run, Ismail?

1840
03:12:35,369 --> 03:12:38,326
The umpires have decided to let...

1841
03:12:38,543 --> 03:12:41,587
...another player run for Ismail!

1842
03:12:42,717 --> 03:12:47,761
When I call, run.
Stay behind the line, understand?

1843
03:12:48,022 --> 03:12:52,848
Good. Now go stand there.
But inside the line.

1844
03:12:54,413 --> 03:12:56,804
Thank God you're back, Ismail.

1845
03:12:57,891 --> 03:13:02,282
We have to make
the rest of the runs.

1846
03:13:02,544 --> 03:13:04,327
There's no one left.

1847
03:13:04,587 --> 03:13:09,544
Don't worry, Bhuvan.
By Allah's grace, victory will be ours.

1848
03:13:09,805 --> 03:13:13,065
We must not lose heart, that's all.

1849
03:13:21,935 --> 03:13:23,978
Look towards me, Tipu.

1850
03:13:26,153 --> 03:13:27,891
Run, Tipu!

1851
03:13:29,978 --> 03:13:32,805
Stop!
Stay behind the line.

1852
03:13:39,196 --> 03:13:41,022
Run, Tipu, run!

1853
03:13:42,891 --> 03:13:44,369
Stop!

1854
03:13:45,239 --> 03:13:47,065
Well done.

1855
03:14:48,892 --> 03:14:51,674
- Was it two or three?
- Three.

1856
03:14:53,499 --> 03:14:56,848
The last hour of play is left.

1857
03:14:57,066 --> 03:15:02,717
Twenty overs will be bowled
during this time.

1858
03:15:31,239 --> 03:15:33,065
Ismail has hit a six!

1859
03:16:01,543 --> 03:16:03,152
Well played!

1860
03:16:03,413 --> 03:16:06,978
With this six, Bhuvan
completes a century!

1861
03:16:09,413 --> 03:16:13,066
This country has a
great future in this game.

1862
03:16:23,413 --> 03:16:26,718
And that's Ismail's
grand 50!

1863
03:16:40,240 --> 03:16:42,456
How many more runs to win?

1864
03:16:42,674 --> 03:16:45,935
We have to make 30 runs
in 1 8 balls.

1865
03:16:46,196 --> 03:16:48,196
- Thirty in 1 8?
- Yes.

1866
03:17:18,847 --> 03:17:20,717
How's that, umpire?

1867
03:17:22,370 --> 03:17:23,848
Well done, Willis!

1868
03:17:24,109 --> 03:17:26,152
Oh, what a shame.

1869
03:17:29,544 --> 03:17:31,978
- Good cricket, sir.
- Well done.

1870
03:17:35,500 --> 03:17:38,457
Run along.
Your mother's waiting.

1871
03:17:58,022 --> 03:18:00,891
Don't worry, Tipu.
Don't worry.

1872
03:18:04,152 --> 03:18:06,674
You played very well.
Well done.

1873
03:18:19,500 --> 03:18:22,848
Father, why is Tipu coming back?

1874
03:18:25,847 --> 03:18:29,457
They now have to make 28 runs...

1875
03:18:29,674 --> 03:18:32,022
...in 1 6 balls.

1876
03:18:32,239 --> 03:18:34,544
Stay put at one end, Bhura.

1877
03:18:34,804 --> 03:18:39,108
Don't lose your wicket.
I'll make the runs.

1878
03:18:39,544 --> 03:18:44,326
He's petrified, Willis.
Get him on strike. Three more to go.

1879
03:18:58,804 --> 03:19:01,848
Willis, hold up!
Smith, third-man!

1880
03:19:02,326 --> 03:19:04,761
Flynn, square boundary.

1881
03:19:05,718 --> 03:19:08,500
Come on, Willis.
Keep it tight, man!

1882
03:19:24,370 --> 03:19:29,021
- Stop! Go back!
- What are you doing?! Get him!

1883
03:19:50,283 --> 03:19:51,848
That was great!

1884
03:19:56,195 --> 03:19:59,066
Willis, keep it tight, man!

1885
03:19:59,326 --> 03:20:02,239
- The ball is old, sir.
- Just do it!

1886
03:20:02,413 --> 03:20:06,109
This is the last ball of the over!
We must take a run.

1887
03:20:06,283 --> 03:20:09,196
Only one run, not two!

1888
03:20:10,891 --> 03:20:14,240
Gentlemen, step up, step up!
Stop the single.

1889
03:20:14,456 --> 03:20:18,544
I want this man on strike!
Step up!

1890
03:20:34,239 --> 03:20:36,674
Good shot.
That's an over.

1891
03:20:36,892 --> 03:20:39,196
He's given us four runs.

1892
03:20:42,327 --> 03:20:44,152
You have to bat now.

1893
03:20:44,370 --> 03:20:48,153
Steady.
Don't let your wicket fall.

1894
03:20:49,457 --> 03:20:52,066
Because of
Captain Russell's cunning...

1895
03:20:52,282 --> 03:20:57,631
...Bhuvan couldn't take just the single.
Bhura must bat now.

1896
03:20:58,195 --> 03:21:00,370
Champaner now needs...

1897
03:21:00,588 --> 03:21:04,021
...1 2 runs from 1 2 balls.

1898
03:21:04,501 --> 03:21:06,544
Smith, keep him on strike.

1899
03:21:06,804 --> 03:21:09,891
Concentrate, gentlemen.
Concentrate!

1900
03:21:10,652 --> 03:21:11,826
Saving one.

1901
03:21:41,217 --> 03:21:43,261
One more to go.

1902
03:21:54,391 --> 03:21:59,521
Save us, Bhuvan, my brother.
It's all in your hands now.

1903
03:22:24,043 --> 03:22:26,218
You did the right thing.

1904
03:22:28,782 --> 03:22:33,522
Go, Kachra. You have to
give Bhuvan support now.

1905
03:22:34,653 --> 03:22:37,478
- Just stay put.
- Don't be afraid.

1906
03:22:38,000 --> 03:22:39,695
Say a prayer and go.

1907
03:22:39,956 --> 03:22:42,913
All right.
We remember this chap, don't we?

1908
03:22:44,652 --> 03:22:46,261
Welcome back.

1909
03:22:47,391 --> 03:22:48,956
Oh, dear.

1910
03:22:49,391 --> 03:22:52,696
The last man in
and he's severely disabled.

1911
03:22:53,304 --> 03:22:55,826
This is the last batsman.

1912
03:22:56,043 --> 03:22:58,957
They need to make 1 2 runs
from 1 1 balls.

1913
03:22:59,305 --> 03:23:00,652
Wesson.

1914
03:23:00,826 --> 03:23:03,696
- Short leg. Stay in close.
- Right, sir.

1915
03:23:05,479 --> 03:23:07,087
Come on, Smith.

1916
03:23:17,826 --> 03:23:19,391
And again.

1917
03:23:23,261 --> 03:23:25,870
Come on, Smith!
He's a sitting duck.

1918
03:23:26,522 --> 03:23:28,348
Careful, Kachra!

1919
03:23:29,305 --> 03:23:30,870
Come on, Smith!

1920
03:23:37,217 --> 03:23:39,217
You aren't hurt, are you?

1921
03:23:51,739 --> 03:23:54,652
Good delivery!

1922
03:24:01,914 --> 03:24:04,608
Come on, Kachra.
Don't be afraid!

1923
03:24:04,826 --> 03:24:06,348
Take him, Smith!

1924
03:24:06,608 --> 03:24:08,609
Just touch and run!

1925
03:24:18,913 --> 03:24:20,696
Just once.

1926
03:24:21,739 --> 03:24:23,304
Run!

1927
03:24:28,479 --> 03:24:31,478
Well done, Kachra!
Stay there.

1928
03:24:37,001 --> 03:24:40,609
This is the last ball.
We must take one run.

1929
03:24:40,782 --> 03:24:42,348
- Be ready.
- Okay.

1930
03:24:42,652 --> 03:24:48,000
Gentlemen, close in. Move in.
Save the one. Keep it this end.

1931
03:24:49,131 --> 03:24:50,305
Smith!

1932
03:25:05,174 --> 03:25:07,827
- Run!
- Run, Kachra!

1933
03:25:14,739 --> 03:25:16,261
Made it.

1934
03:25:16,957 --> 03:25:19,696
Well done!
Well done, Kachra.

1935
03:25:22,696 --> 03:25:25,000
Six more balls...

1936
03:25:25,261 --> 03:25:28,131
...and 1 0 runs to make
for a victory.

1937
03:25:28,348 --> 03:25:33,261
Gentlemen, I want everybody to
keep on their toes. Be alert.

1938
03:25:33,521 --> 03:25:36,217
Save the twos and the boundaries.

1939
03:25:36,478 --> 03:25:41,174
Let them have the single.
Let the cripple take the strike.

1940
03:25:53,131 --> 03:25:56,521
Yardley, I'm depending on you.

1941
03:25:56,782 --> 03:26:01,000
Don't give away anything.
Just get him.

1942
03:26:02,304 --> 03:26:03,696
Gentlemen!

1943
03:26:50,522 --> 03:26:53,522
Well done.
That won't do us any harm.

1944
03:26:53,827 --> 03:26:55,783
Are you all right?

1945
03:27:10,652 --> 03:27:12,088
Keep it up.

1946
03:27:19,652 --> 03:27:21,652
Careful, Bhuvan!

1947
03:27:29,174 --> 03:27:32,087
Run!
Take two!

1948
03:27:34,695 --> 03:27:37,522
Stop! Go back.

1949
03:27:47,348 --> 03:27:49,261
We must take a single!

1950
03:27:49,957 --> 03:27:51,434
Touch and run!

1951
03:27:51,652 --> 03:27:54,175
Gentlemen, close in, close in!

1952
03:27:54,391 --> 03:27:57,435
All you men in the field, come on!

1953
03:27:59,478 --> 03:28:01,696
Kachra, touch and run!

1954
03:28:06,740 --> 03:28:08,522
Good bowling, Yardley.

1955
03:28:11,609 --> 03:28:16,522
We must take a run off this ball.
Only two more balls are left.

1956
03:28:16,739 --> 03:28:19,435
We have to take a run!

1957
03:28:20,347 --> 03:28:22,174
Go on, Yardley.

1958
03:28:22,435 --> 03:28:25,522
Dig one in. Dig one in, Yardley.
Come on.

1959
03:28:25,695 --> 03:28:27,740
Run, Kachra!

1960
03:28:28,521 --> 03:28:33,087
We have to take one run!
Just touch and run!

1961
03:28:33,348 --> 03:28:37,218
Everybody close in!
Stop the single! Close in!

1962
03:28:39,609 --> 03:28:42,348
Why can't you just strike the ball?

1963
03:28:53,913 --> 03:28:57,347
Just one more ball to go.

1964
03:29:11,957 --> 03:29:16,000
Kachra, this is the last ball
of the game.

1965
03:29:17,043 --> 03:29:20,304
And we need five runs to win.

1966
03:29:23,086 --> 03:29:26,435
You'll have to hit the ball
over the boundary.

1967
03:29:28,652 --> 03:29:31,130
Or else, triple lagaan.

1968
03:29:32,261 --> 03:29:35,696
Our lives are in your hands, Kachra.

1969
03:29:36,044 --> 03:29:38,000
Do something!

1970
03:29:39,696 --> 03:29:41,131
Do something.

1971
03:29:48,131 --> 03:29:50,913
Come on, Yardley.
Just once more.

1972
03:29:54,348 --> 03:29:55,739
Field.

1973
03:30:00,479 --> 03:30:02,217
Hit it, Kachra.

1974
03:30:03,739 --> 03:30:05,478
- Hit it!
- Hit it, Kachra!

1975
03:30:12,305 --> 03:30:14,696
- Hit it, Kachra!
- Lift it, Kachra!

1976
03:30:19,913 --> 03:30:22,826
Triple lagaan!

1977
03:30:31,522 --> 03:30:33,043
No ball.

1978
03:30:33,783 --> 03:30:35,696
No ball!

1979
03:30:37,566 --> 03:30:40,130
- What?
- No ball.

1980
03:30:44,566 --> 03:30:47,130
No ball?
What do you mean, no ball?

1981
03:30:47,348 --> 03:30:51,391
- His foot was over the line.
- Yardley?

1982
03:30:52,956 --> 03:30:57,044
- Are you certain?
- I am not discussing it.

1983
03:30:57,304 --> 03:31:00,348
I suggest we get on with the game.

1984
03:31:02,348 --> 03:31:03,913
Very well.

1985
03:31:04,174 --> 03:31:07,566
We have one more ball.
Back to your positions!

1986
03:31:07,826 --> 03:31:12,653
Because of the no ball,
we have one more ball to face!

1987
03:31:25,782 --> 03:31:28,305
No more mistakes this time.

1988
03:31:32,348 --> 03:31:35,173
Gentlemen, back to the boundary.

1989
03:31:37,131 --> 03:31:41,434
Everybody, back to the boundaries.
Back! Back!

1990
03:31:54,826 --> 03:31:57,392
If you lose, you pay...

1991
03:31:57,609 --> 03:31:59,956
...triple lagaan.

1992
03:32:00,391 --> 03:32:02,957
Do you accept?

1993
03:32:05,130 --> 03:32:08,478
And Bhuvan accepted
this impossible bet!

1994
03:32:08,695 --> 03:32:11,261
What have you done?

1995
03:32:13,913 --> 03:32:18,174
I told you we could
face a calamity, didn't I?

1996
03:32:28,348 --> 03:32:30,869
You talk just like your father.

1997
03:32:31,130 --> 03:32:35,435
He was just as spirited.
Always spoke the truth.

1998
03:32:42,869 --> 03:32:44,696
I have faith...

1999
03:32:44,869 --> 03:32:48,131
...in you and in your courage.

2000
03:33:07,000 --> 03:33:09,131
Catch it, sir!

2001
03:33:12,956 --> 03:33:14,435
Catch it, sir!

2002
03:33:19,739 --> 03:33:22,131
Please don't catch it!

2003
03:33:55,522 --> 03:33:57,782
We have won!

2004
03:34:04,304 --> 03:34:05,478
He's done it!

2005
03:34:23,957 --> 03:34:26,260
Completely unbelievable!

2006
03:35:18,043 --> 03:35:19,522
Bloody...!

2007
03:36:51,348 --> 03:36:55,435
Unable to bear this humiliation,
the British government...

2008
03:36:55,609 --> 03:36:59,913
...decided to shut down the
Champaner cantonment.

2009
03:37:00,175 --> 03:37:04,000
By the power vested in me
by Queen Victoria...

2010
03:37:04,261 --> 03:37:07,565
...l hereby declare,
after much deliberation...

2011
03:37:07,783 --> 03:37:11,391
...the cantonment at Champaner
be dissolved.

2012
03:37:11,609 --> 03:37:14,608
And the officers and troops...

2013
03:37:14,826 --> 03:37:17,304
...shall re-establish themselves...

2014
03:37:17,522 --> 03:37:21,478
...in the princely state of Rajghat,
with immediate effect.

2015
03:37:21,739 --> 03:37:27,088
Signed, Colonel J. R. Boyer
Commanding Officer, Central Provinces

2016
03:37:30,217 --> 03:37:34,218
I did not believe
I'd live to see this day.

2017
03:38:14,260 --> 03:38:18,218
May you be happy, my daughter.
May you live long.

2018
03:38:50,043 --> 03:38:52,913
Memsahib, we will never forget...

2019
03:38:53,913 --> 03:38:56,131
...what you've done for us.

2020
03:39:00,478 --> 03:39:02,435
I won't either.

2021
03:39:26,870 --> 03:39:31,261
Not just Champaner, but all
the villages in the province...

2022
03:39:31,522 --> 03:39:34,696
...did not have to pay lagaan
for three years.

2023
03:39:34,957 --> 03:39:38,696
Captain Russell paid for his
capricious behaviour.

2024
03:39:38,870 --> 03:39:42,783
Besides having to pay triple lagaan,
he was transferred...

2025
03:39:43,000 --> 03:39:45,652
...to the Central African desert.

2026
03:39:46,869 --> 03:39:52,000
Elizabeth returned to England
with Bhuvan in her heart.

2027
03:39:52,218 --> 03:39:57,348
She did not marry and remained
Bhuvan's Radha all her life.

2028
03:39:57,957 --> 03:40:00,739
Bhuvan and Gauri
had a splendid wedding.

2029
03:40:00,956 --> 03:40:03,739
Rajah Puran Singh himself
blessed them...

2030
03:40:03,957 --> 03:40:07,217
...enhancing Champaner's status
even more.

2031
03:40:07,956 --> 03:40:10,695
Even after this historic victory...

2032
