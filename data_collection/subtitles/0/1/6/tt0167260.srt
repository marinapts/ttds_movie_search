1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,074

2
00:01:19,169 --> 00:01:21,296
I've got one!

3
00:01:22,006 --> 00:01:23,883
I've got a fish, Sméag. Sméagol!

4
00:01:24,175 --> 00:01:27,178
Pull it in. Go on. Go on. Go on.
Pull it in.

5
00:01:35,604 --> 00:01:37,272
Déagol!

6
00:02:34,793 --> 00:02:36,503
Déagol?

7
00:02:39,172 --> 00:02:41,300
Déagol.

8
00:02:57,192 --> 00:02:59,194
Give us that, Déagol, my love.

9
00:03:04,283 --> 00:03:05,493
Why?

10
00:03:06,702 --> 00:03:08,788
Because...

11
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,709
...it's my birthday and I wants it.

12
00:04:46,894 --> 00:04:51,900
My precious.

13
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,411
They cursed us.

14
00:05:02,786 --> 00:05:04,121
Murderer.

15
00:05:04,288 --> 00:05:06,624
"Murderer" they called us.

16
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:11,504
They cursed us
and drove us away.

17
00:05:12,922 --> 00:05:14,507
Gollum.

18
00:05:14,716 --> 00:05:16,301
Gollum.

19
00:05:16,593 --> 00:05:18,512
Gollum.

20
00:05:22,224 --> 00:05:25,019
And we wept, precious.

21
00:05:25,311 --> 00:05:28,689
We wept to be so alone.

22
00:05:31,401 --> 00:05:35,113
...and cool. So nice for feet

23
00:05:36,198 --> 00:05:40,410
And we only wish
To catch a fish

24
00:05:40,828 --> 00:05:43,914
So juicy sweet

25
00:05:49,796 --> 00:05:53,800
And we forgot the taste of bread...

26
00:05:54,217 --> 00:05:57,596
...the sound of trees...

27
00:05:58,597 --> 00:06:01,600
...the softness of the wind.

28
00:06:02,518 --> 00:06:07,899
We even forgot our own name.

29
00:06:16,324 --> 00:06:22,414
My precious.

30
00:07:06,921 --> 00:07:09,006
Wake up!

31
00:07:10,299 --> 00:07:11,801
Wake up!

32
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,720
Wake up, sleepies.

33
00:07:14,012 --> 00:07:15,805
We must go, yes.

34
00:07:16,097 --> 00:07:18,600
We must go at once.

35
00:07:22,313 --> 00:07:25,316
Haven't you had any sleep, Mr. Frodo?

36
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,029
I've gone and had too much.

37
00:07:31,531 --> 00:07:33,116
Must be getting late.

38
00:07:33,408 --> 00:07:34,826
No.

39
00:07:35,118 --> 00:07:36,912
It isn't.

40
00:07:37,204 --> 00:07:40,123
It isn't midday yet.

41
00:07:40,415 --> 00:07:42,835
The days are growing darker.

42
00:07:47,214 --> 00:07:49,300
Come on!

43
00:07:51,928 --> 00:07:54,014
Must go! No time!

44
00:07:54,305 --> 00:07:56,600
Not before Mr. Frodo's
had something to eat.

45
00:07:56,808 --> 00:07:59,603
No time to lose, silly.

46
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:09,614
Here.

47
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,703
What about you?

48
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:18,206
Oh, no, I'm not hungry.
Leastways, not for lembas bread.

49
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,209
Sam.

50
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,338
All right.

51
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,008
We don't have that much left.

52
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:30,011
We have to be careful
or we're going to run out.

53
00:08:32,305 --> 00:08:35,141
You go ahead and eat that, Mr. Frodo.

54
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:36,726
I've rationed it.

55
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,937
There should be enough.

56
00:08:41,231 --> 00:08:42,316
For what?

57
00:08:44,026 --> 00:08:45,736
The journey home.

58
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,830
Come, Hobbitses.

59
00:08:57,332 --> 00:08:59,126
Very close now.

60
00:08:59,334 --> 00:09:02,421
Very close to Mordor.

61
00:09:02,838 --> 00:09:05,424
No safe places here.

62
00:09:05,633 --> 00:09:07,718
Hurry.

63
00:10:00,234 --> 00:10:01,819
It's good.

64
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,446
Definitely from the Shire.

65
00:10:06,824 --> 00:10:08,826
Longbottom Leaf.

66
00:10:14,249 --> 00:10:18,420
I feel like I'm back at
The Green Dragon.

67
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,716
-Green Dragon.
-A mug of ale in my hand.

68
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:27,430
Putting my feet up on a settle
after a hard day's work.

69
00:10:28,347 --> 00:10:31,643
Only, you've never done
a hard day's work.

70
00:10:44,532 --> 00:10:47,451
Welcome, my lords...

71
00:10:47,827 --> 00:10:49,954
...to lsengard!

72
00:10:50,413 --> 00:10:54,042
You young rascals!
A merry hunt you've led us on...

73
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:59,047
...and now we find you feasting
and...and smoking!

74
00:10:59,423 --> 00:11:02,426
We are sitting on a field of victory...

75
00:11:02,843 --> 00:11:06,138
...enjoying a few well-earned comforts.

76
00:11:07,431 --> 00:11:11,144
The salted pork is particularly good.

77
00:11:11,728 --> 00:11:14,022
Salted pork?

78
00:11:15,315 --> 00:11:18,652
-Hobbits.
-We're under orders from Treebeard...

79
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:21,655
...who's taken over management
of lsengard.

80
00:11:24,325 --> 00:11:27,245
Young Master Gandalf.

81
00:11:27,536 --> 00:11:31,916
I'm glad you've come.

82
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,546
Wood and water, stock and stone
I can master.

83
00:11:36,838 --> 00:11:40,342
But there is a wizard to manage here...

84
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:42,553
... locked in his tower.

85
00:11:45,347 --> 00:11:46,641
Show yourself.

86
00:11:46,933 --> 00:11:48,518
Be careful.

87
00:11:49,435 --> 00:11:52,021
Even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous.

88
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,357
Well, let's just have his head
and be done with it.

89
00:11:54,524 --> 00:11:56,526
No.

90
00:11:56,943 --> 00:11:59,154
We need him alive.

91
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:02,741
We need him to talk.

92
00:12:04,743 --> 00:12:08,748
You have fought many wars
and slain many men, Théoden King...

93
00:12:09,123 --> 00:12:10,541
...and made peace afterwards.

94
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:15,547
Can we not take counsel together
as we once did, my old friend?

95
00:12:15,922 --> 00:12:19,051
Can we not have peace, you and l?

96
00:12:19,343 --> 00:12:21,136
We shall have peace.

97
00:12:23,138 --> 00:12:25,224
We shall have peace...

98
00:12:25,349 --> 00:12:29,228
...when you answer
for the burning of the Westfold...

99
00:12:29,645 --> 00:12:32,232
...and the children that lie dead there!

100
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:37,154
We shall have peace
when the lives of the soldiers...

101
00:12:37,446 --> 00:12:39,448
...whose bodies were hewn
even as they lay dead...

102
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:43,035
...against the gates of the Hornburg,
are avenged!

103
00:12:44,745 --> 00:12:50,126
When you hang from a gibbet
for the sport of your own crows...

104
00:12:51,336 --> 00:12:53,463
...we shall have peace.

105
00:12:56,341 --> 00:12:58,927
Gibbets and crows?

106
00:12:59,344 --> 00:13:00,554
Dotard!

107
00:13:02,056 --> 00:13:04,725
What do you want, Gandalf Greyhame?

108
00:13:05,935 --> 00:13:08,354
Let me guess. The Key of Orthanc.

109
00:13:08,563 --> 00:13:11,357
Or perhaps the Keys of Barad-dûr itself...

110
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:15,445
...along with the crowns of the seven kings
and the rods of the Five Wizards!

111
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:18,657
Your treachery has already cost
many lives.

112
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:21,243
Thousands more are now at risk.

113
00:13:21,452 --> 00:13:23,746
But you could save them, Saruman.

114
00:13:24,038 --> 00:13:26,248
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

115
00:13:26,457 --> 00:13:29,627
So you have come here for information.

116
00:13:30,628 --> 00:13:32,464
I have some for you.

117
00:13:37,928 --> 00:13:40,848
Something festers
in the heart of Middle-earth.

118
00:13:41,056 --> 00:13:43,267
Something that you have failed to see.

119
00:13:45,853 --> 00:13:49,148
But the Great Eye has seen it.

120
00:13:50,441 --> 00:13:53,945
Even now he presses his advantage.

121
00:13:55,864 --> 00:13:59,034
His attack will come soon.

122
00:14:01,453 --> 00:14:03,455
You're all going to die.

123
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:09,253
But you know this, don't you, Gandalf?

124
00:14:09,462 --> 00:14:13,967
You cannot think that this Ranger
will ever sit upon the throne of Gender.

125
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:20,140
This exile, crept from the shadows,
will never be crowned king.

126
00:14:21,767 --> 00:14:25,271
Gandalf does not hesitate
to sacrifice those closest to him...

127
00:14:26,355 --> 00:14:28,441
...those he professes to love.

128
00:14:29,567 --> 00:14:33,863
Tell me, what words of comfort
did you give the Half ling...

129
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:37,159
...before you sent him to his doom?

130
00:14:39,661 --> 00:14:44,166
The path that you have set him on
can only lead to death.

131
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,752
I've heard enough!

132
00:14:47,044 --> 00:14:48,838
Shoot him.
Stick an arrow in his gob.

133
00:14:49,464 --> 00:14:50,965
No.

134
00:14:51,549 --> 00:14:53,635
Come down, Saruman...

135
00:14:53,968 --> 00:14:57,764
-...and your life will be spared.
-Save your pity and your mercy.

136
00:14:58,056 --> 00:14:59,349
I have no use for it!

137
00:15:08,651 --> 00:15:09,944
Saruman...

138
00:15:11,154 --> 00:15:14,157
...your staff is broken.

139
00:15:25,169 --> 00:15:28,464
Gríma, you need not follow him.

140
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:32,343
You were not always as you are now.

141
00:15:32,677 --> 00:15:35,347
You were once a Man of Rohan.

142
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:36,848
Come down.

143
00:15:37,057 --> 00:15:39,643
A Man of Rohan?

144
00:15:40,644 --> 00:15:42,855
What is the house of Rohan...

145
00:15:43,063 --> 00:15:46,567
... but a thatched barn
where brigands drink in the reek...

146
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:50,571
...and their brats roll on the floor
with the dogs?

147
00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:57,370
The victory at Helm's Deep does not
belong to you, Théoden Horse-master.

148
00:15:58,246 --> 00:16:02,543
You are a lesser son of greater sires.

149
00:16:05,171 --> 00:16:06,756
Gríma...

150
00:16:07,673 --> 00:16:09,467
...come down.

151
00:16:09,967 --> 00:16:11,261
Be free of him.

152
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:15,348
-Free? He will never be free.
-No.

153
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:18,477
Get down, cur!

154
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,480
Saruman!

155
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,275
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

156
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,861
Tell us what you know!

157
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:33,576
You withdraw your guard, and I will tell you
where your doom will be decided.

158
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:37,372
I will not be held prisoner here.

159
00:17:04,652 --> 00:17:06,153
Send word to all our allies...

160
00:17:06,278 --> 00:17:09,073
...and to every corner of Middle-earth
that still stands free.

161
00:17:09,866 --> 00:17:12,786
The enemy moves against us.
We need to know where he will strike.

162
00:17:32,182 --> 00:17:35,852
The filth of Saruman...

163
00:17:36,269 --> 00:17:39,982
... is washing away.

164
00:17:40,274 --> 00:17:44,570
Trees will come back to live here.

165
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:47,365
Young trees.

166
00:17:47,573 --> 00:17:49,659
-Wiild trees.
-Pippin!

167
00:17:59,253 --> 00:18:01,380
Bless my bark!

168
00:18:01,672 --> 00:18:03,465
Peregrin Took!

169
00:18:03,674 --> 00:18:06,177
I'll take that, my lad.

170
00:18:06,469 --> 00:18:08,262
Quickly, now.

171
00:18:58,483 --> 00:19:03,864
Tonight we remember those who
gave their blood to defend this country.

172
00:19:04,782 --> 00:19:06,784
Hail the victorious dead.

173
00:19:07,076 --> 00:19:08,369
Hail!

174
00:19:19,381 --> 00:19:21,258
No pauses.

175
00:19:21,467 --> 00:19:25,471
-No spills.
-And no regurgitation.

176
00:19:26,097 --> 00:19:27,682
So it's a drinking game?

177
00:19:29,392 --> 00:19:31,978
Last one standing wins.

178
00:19:36,483 --> 00:19:38,360
What'll we drink to?
Let's drink to victory!

179
00:19:38,485 --> 00:19:39,862
To victory!

180
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,530
Be thou, Aragorn, well.

181
00:20:23,993 --> 00:20:25,494
I am happy for you.

182
00:20:25,995 --> 00:20:28,289
He is an honourable man.

183
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:31,167
You are both honourable men.

184
00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:38,300
It was not Théoden of Rohan
who led our people to victory.

185
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,394
Don't listen to me.

186
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,688
You are young.

187
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,191
And tonight is for you.

188
00:21:07,665 --> 00:21:09,292
Here, here.

189
00:21:10,793 --> 00:21:16,466
It's the Dwarves that go swimming
with little, hairy women.

190
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:23,307
I feel something.

191
00:21:25,476 --> 00:21:27,895
A slight tingle in my fingers.

192
00:21:28,771 --> 00:21:30,273
I think it's affecting me.

193
00:21:32,192 --> 00:21:33,902
What did I say?

194
00:21:34,069 --> 00:21:37,280
He can't hold his liquor.

195
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:45,998
Game over.

196
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:49,585
Oh, you can search far and wide
You can drink the whole town dry

197
00:21:49,877 --> 00:21:53,590
But you'll never find a beer so brown
But you'll never find a beer so brown

198
00:21:54,007 --> 00:21:58,178
As the one we drink in our hometown
As the one we drink in our hometown

199
00:21:58,595 --> 00:22:02,307
You can drink your fancy ales
You can drink 'em by the flagon

200
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:05,603
But the only brew for the brave and true

201
00:22:08,481 --> 00:22:09,690
Pippin!

202
00:22:10,108 --> 00:22:12,986
But the only brew for the brave and true

203
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:16,198
Comes from The Green Dragon

204
00:22:18,992 --> 00:22:21,704
Thank you! I win!

205
00:22:23,581 --> 00:22:26,000
No news of Frodo?

206
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:29,587
No word. Nothing.

207
00:22:30,588 --> 00:22:32,674
We have time.

208
00:22:34,175 --> 00:22:37,387
Every day, Frodo moves closer to Mordor.

209
00:22:38,305 --> 00:22:40,307
Do we know that?

210
00:22:44,186 --> 00:22:45,813
What does your heart tell you?

211
00:22:52,987 --> 00:22:56,199
That Frodo is alive.

212
00:22:58,493 --> 00:23:00,204
Yes.

213
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:04,875
Yes, he's alive.

214
00:23:07,295 --> 00:23:10,006
Too risky. Too risky.

215
00:23:10,298 --> 00:23:11,507
Thieves.

216
00:23:11,716 --> 00:23:13,676
They stole it from us.

217
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:17,305
Kill them. Kill them. Kill them both.

218
00:23:19,516 --> 00:23:22,186
Quiet! Mustn't wake them.

219
00:23:22,478 --> 00:23:24,897
Mustn't ruin it now.

220
00:23:25,189 --> 00:23:27,108
But they knows.

221
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,193
They knows.

222
00:23:29,485 --> 00:23:31,988
They suspects us.

223
00:23:33,281 --> 00:23:36,618
What's it saying, my precious, my love?

224
00:23:36,993 --> 00:23:40,414
Is Sméagol losing his nerve?

225
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:43,584
No. Not.

226
00:23:43,792 --> 00:23:47,880
Never. Sméagol hates nasty Hobbitses.

227
00:23:48,297 --> 00:23:52,886
Sméagol wants to see them dead.

228
00:23:53,303 --> 00:23:55,680
And we will.

229
00:23:56,014 --> 00:23:59,810
Sméagol did it once.
He can do it again.

230
00:24:03,397 --> 00:24:05,900
It's ours!

231
00:24:06,192 --> 00:24:08,694
Ours!

232
00:24:09,904 --> 00:24:12,699
We must get the precious.
We must get it back.

233
00:24:12,991 --> 00:24:16,286
Patience! Patience, my love.

234
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:20,791
First we must lead them to her.

235
00:24:21,792 --> 00:24:26,589
We lead them to the Wiinding Stair.

236
00:24:27,006 --> 00:24:29,509
Yes, the stairs. And then?

237
00:24:29,884 --> 00:24:32,804
Up, up, up, up,
up the stairs we go...

238
00:24:33,012 --> 00:24:39,186
...until we come to the tunnel.

239
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,815
And when they go in...

240
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:45,818
...there's no coming out.

241
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:49,489
She's always hungry.

242
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:54,494
She always needs to feed.

243
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:56,204
She must eat.

244
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:58,415
All she gets is filthy Orcses.

245
00:24:58,707 --> 00:25:01,293
And they doesn't taste very nice,
does they, precious?

246
00:25:02,086 --> 00:25:03,712
No.

247
00:25:03,796 --> 00:25:08,301
Not very nice at all, my love.

248
00:25:08,718 --> 00:25:11,387
She hungers for sweeter meats.

249
00:25:11,804 --> 00:25:13,515
Hobbit meat.

250
00:25:13,723 --> 00:25:18,312
And when she throws away the bones
and the empty clothes...

251
00:25:18,812 --> 00:25:21,690
...then we will find it.

252
00:25:22,024 --> 00:25:26,112
And take it for me!

253
00:25:27,989 --> 00:25:29,407
For us.

254
00:25:29,991 --> 00:25:32,827
Yes. We meant "for us."

255
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:36,414
Gollum. Gollum.

256
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:41,128
The precious will be ours...

257
00:25:41,503 --> 00:25:45,800
...once the Hobbitses are dead!

258
00:25:46,509 --> 00:25:47,927
You treacherous little toad!

259
00:25:50,722 --> 00:25:52,891
No! No! Master!

260
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:54,726
No, Sam! Leave him alone!

261
00:25:55,602 --> 00:25:58,230
I heard it from his own mouth.
He means to murder us.

262
00:25:58,522 --> 00:26:02,401
Never! Sméagol wouldn't hurt a fly.

263
00:26:04,111 --> 00:26:06,614
He's a horrid, fat Hobbit...

264
00:26:06,822 --> 00:26:08,324
...who hates Sméagol...

265
00:26:08,616 --> 00:26:11,327
...and who makes up nasty lies.

266
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:14,122
You miserable little maggot!
I'll stove your head in!

267
00:26:14,623 --> 00:26:15,790
Sam!

268
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:18,502
Call me a liar? You're a liar!

269
00:26:19,503 --> 00:26:23,215
-You scare him off, we're lost!
-I don't care! I can't do it, Mr. Frodo.

270
00:26:23,591 --> 00:26:26,594
-I won't wait around for him to kill us!
-I'm not sending him away.

271
00:26:27,094 --> 00:26:28,304
You don't see it, do you?

272
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,223
He's a villain.

273
00:26:31,307 --> 00:26:34,728
We can't do this by ourselves, Sam.
Not without a guide.

274
00:26:35,812 --> 00:26:38,523
I need you on my side.

275
00:26:39,524 --> 00:26:41,694
I'm on your side, Mr. Frodo.

276
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,115
I know, Sam. I know.

277
00:26:46,824 --> 00:26:48,701
Trust me.

278
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:51,204
Come, Sméagol.

279
00:27:59,236 --> 00:28:00,612
What time is it?

280
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:04,533
Not yet dawn.

281
00:28:11,541 --> 00:28:14,419
I dreamed I saw a great wave...

282
00:28:14,628 --> 00:28:18,507
...climbing over green lands
and above the hills.

283
00:28:20,008 --> 00:28:22,302
I stood upon the brink.

284
00:28:23,304 --> 00:28:26,307
It was utterly dark in the abyss
before my feet.

285
00:28:28,434 --> 00:28:31,104
A light shone behind me...

286
00:28:31,813 --> 00:28:34,107
...but I could not turn.

287
00:28:34,524 --> 00:28:37,736
I could only stand there, waiting.

288
00:28:39,238 --> 00:28:41,824
Night changes many thoughts.

289
00:28:42,408 --> 00:28:44,535
Sleep, Éowyn.

290
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:47,204
Sleep...

291
00:28:50,124 --> 00:28:51,834
...while you can.

292
00:29:16,111 --> 00:29:18,322
The stars are veiled.

293
00:29:19,406 --> 00:29:22,743
Something stirs in the east.

294
00:29:23,619 --> 00:29:26,622
A sleepless malice.

295
00:29:28,708 --> 00:29:31,419
The Eye of the enemy is moving.

296
00:29:44,934 --> 00:29:47,436
What are you doing?

297
00:29:52,233 --> 00:29:53,610
Pippin!

298
00:30:01,243 --> 00:30:02,911
Pippin?

299
00:30:15,842 --> 00:30:17,135
Pippin.

300
00:30:17,928 --> 00:30:20,430
-What, are you mad?
-I just want to look at it.

301
00:30:20,722 --> 00:30:21,724
Just one more time.

302
00:30:22,016 --> 00:30:24,018
Put it back.

303
00:30:34,446 --> 00:30:36,114
Pippin.

304
00:30:42,746 --> 00:30:44,123
No!

305
00:30:49,337 --> 00:30:50,546
Pippin.

306
00:30:53,842 --> 00:30:55,051
He is here.

307
00:30:55,218 --> 00:30:57,429
I see you.

308
00:31:00,516 --> 00:31:02,142
Pippin!

309
00:31:16,825 --> 00:31:19,453
Help! Gandalf, help!

310
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:23,123
Someone help him!

311
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:30,757
Pippin!

312
00:31:31,925 --> 00:31:33,134
Fool of a Took!

313
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,326
Look at me.

314
00:31:58,453 --> 00:32:02,458
Gandalf, forgive me.

315
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:04,543
Look at me.

316
00:32:04,752 --> 00:32:06,545
What did you see?

317
00:32:10,133 --> 00:32:12,135
A tree.

318
00:32:13,261 --> 00:32:14,930
There was a white tree...

319
00:32:15,221 --> 00:32:16,640
...in a courtyard of stone.

320
00:32:19,434 --> 00:32:20,727
It was dead.

321
00:32:25,024 --> 00:32:26,734
The city was burning.

322
00:32:27,026 --> 00:32:30,238
Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?

323
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,949
I saw....

324
00:32:36,453 --> 00:32:37,746
I saw him.

325
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,960
I could hear his voice in my head.

326
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:45,546
And what did you tell him?

327
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:47,548
Speak!

328
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:54,931
He asked me my name.
I didn't answer.

329
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,558
He hurt me.

330
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,144
What did you tell him
about Frodo and the Ring?

331
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:05,151
There was no lie in Pippin's eyes.

332
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:08,237
A fool...

333
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:10,740
...but an honest fool he remains.

334
00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:14,661
He told Sauron nothing
of Frodo and the Ring.

335
00:33:15,745 --> 00:33:18,040
We've been strangely fortunate.

336
00:33:18,457 --> 00:33:22,127
Pippin saw in the palantír
a glimpse of the enemy's plan.

337
00:33:23,254 --> 00:33:27,049
Sauron moves to strike
the city of Minas Tirith.

338
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:31,262
His defeat at Helm's Deep
showed our enemy one thing.

339
00:33:31,638 --> 00:33:33,848
He knows the heir of Elendil
has come forth.

340
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,142
Men are not as weak as he supposed.

341
00:33:36,434 --> 00:33:40,063
There is courage still, strength
enough perhaps to challenge him.

342
00:33:40,439 --> 00:33:42,232
Sauron fears this.

343
00:33:42,441 --> 00:33:46,529
He will not risk the peoples of
Middle-earth uniting under one banner.

344
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:50,366
He will raze Minas Tirith
to the ground...

345
00:33:50,658 --> 00:33:53,953
...before he sees a king
return to the throne of Men.

346
00:33:54,245 --> 00:33:57,958
If the beacons of Gender are lit,
Rohan must be ready for war.

347
00:33:59,042 --> 00:34:01,170
Tell me...

348
00:34:01,462 --> 00:34:05,049
...why should we ride to the aid
of those who did not come to ours?

349
00:34:09,137 --> 00:34:10,847
What do we owe Gender?

350
00:34:12,056 --> 00:34:13,933
-I will go.
-No!

351
00:34:14,267 --> 00:34:17,270
-They must be warned.
-They will be.

352
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:23,360
You must come to Minas Tirith
by another road.

353
00:34:23,944 --> 00:34:28,241
Follow the river.
Look to the black ships.

354
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:31,369
Understand this:

355
00:34:31,452 --> 00:34:34,956
Things are now in motion
that cannot be undone.

356
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,752
I ride for Minas Tirith...

357
00:34:41,046 --> 00:34:43,549
...and I won't be going alone.

358
00:34:45,468 --> 00:34:48,971
Of all the inquisitive Hobbits,
Peregrin Took, you are the worst.

359
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:51,766
Hurry! Hurry!

360
00:34:53,268 --> 00:34:54,644
Where are we going?

361
00:34:54,853 --> 00:34:56,062
Why did you look?

362
00:34:56,354 --> 00:34:58,941
Why do you always have to look?

363
00:34:59,274 --> 00:35:02,152
-I don't know. I can't help it.
-You never can.

364
00:35:02,736 --> 00:35:04,071
I'm sorry, all right?

365
00:35:06,365 --> 00:35:09,035
-I won't do it again.
-Don't you understand?

366
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:11,746
The enemy thinks you have the Ring.

367
00:35:12,038 --> 00:35:15,667
He's going to be looking for you, Pip.
They have to get you out of here.

368
00:35:17,252 --> 00:35:19,755
And you... ? You're coming with me?

369
00:35:22,174 --> 00:35:23,467
Merry?

370
00:35:23,759 --> 00:35:24,969
Come on.

371
00:35:30,558 --> 00:35:31,851
How far is Minas Tirith?

372
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,562
Three days' ride, as the Nazgûl flies.

373
00:35:34,854 --> 00:35:38,150
And you better hope we don't have
one of those on our tail.

374
00:35:39,067 --> 00:35:40,444
Here.

375
00:35:40,778 --> 00:35:42,446
Something for the road.

376
00:35:43,447 --> 00:35:45,241
The last of the Longbottom Leaf.

377
00:35:45,574 --> 00:35:49,370
I know you've run out.
You smoke too much, Pippin.

378
00:35:49,662 --> 00:35:52,040
But... But we'll see each other soon.

379
00:35:55,544 --> 00:35:57,963
-Won't we?
-I don't know.

380
00:36:00,048 --> 00:36:02,051
I don't know what's going to happen.

381
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,844
-Merry.
-Run, Shadowfax.

382
00:36:04,053 --> 00:36:05,471
Show us the meaning of haste.

383
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:07,557
Merry!

384
00:36:18,151 --> 00:36:19,152
Merry!

385
00:36:29,747 --> 00:36:31,165
He's always followed me...

386
00:36:31,958 --> 00:36:33,877
...everywhere I went...

387
00:36:34,377 --> 00:36:36,046
...since before we were tweens.

388
00:36:37,255 --> 00:36:40,968
I would get him into
the worst sort of trouble...

389
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,262
...but I was always there to get him out.

390
00:36:45,848 --> 00:36:47,683
Now he's gone.

391
00:36:49,477 --> 00:36:52,272
Just like Frodo and Sam.

392
00:36:52,981 --> 00:36:55,567
One thing I have learned about Hobbits:

393
00:36:55,859 --> 00:36:57,444
They're a most hardy folk.

394
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:01,573
Foolhardy, maybe. He's a Took.

395
00:37:16,256 --> 00:37:18,467
Take her by the safest road.

396
00:37:18,759 --> 00:37:21,178
A ship lies anchored
in the Grey Havens.

397
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:25,182
It waits to carry her across the sea.

398
00:37:25,474 --> 00:37:28,770
The last journey of Arwen Undómiel.

399
00:38:34,466 --> 00:38:37,386
There is nothing for you here...

400
00:38:37,969 --> 00:38:40,055
...only death.

401
00:38:47,563 --> 00:38:48,773
Lady Arwen...

402
00:38:49,774 --> 00:38:51,568
...we cannot delay.

403
00:38:54,154 --> 00:38:55,363
My lady!

404
00:39:14,759 --> 00:39:17,262
-Tell me what you have seen.
-Arwen.

405
00:39:17,596 --> 00:39:19,389
You have the gift of foresight.

406
00:39:19,681 --> 00:39:21,392
What did you see?

407
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:25,271
I looked into your future,
and I saw death.

408
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,065
But there is also life.

409
00:39:29,984 --> 00:39:33,863
You saw there was a child.
You saw my son.

410
00:39:34,698 --> 00:39:37,075
That future is almost gone.

411
00:39:37,367 --> 00:39:39,286
But it is not lost.

412
00:39:41,997 --> 00:39:44,083
Nothing is certain.

413
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,463
Some things are certain.

414
00:39:52,467 --> 00:39:55,178
If I leave him now...

415
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:57,973
... I will regret it forever.

416
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:01,393
It is time.

417
00:40:06,691 --> 00:40:10,278
From the ashes a fire shall be woken

418
00:40:10,695 --> 00:40:13,990
A light from the shadow shall spring

419
00:40:14,366 --> 00:40:17,494
Renewed shall be blade that was broken

420
00:40:25,002 --> 00:40:28,089
The crownless again shall be king

421
00:40:31,968 --> 00:40:33,887
Re-forge the sword.

422
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,380
Father.

423
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:11,469
Your hands are cold.

424
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:17,893
The life of the Eldar is leaving you.

425
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,274
This was my choice.

426
00:41:25,276 --> 00:41:27,486
Whether by your will or not...

427
00:41:28,905 --> 00:41:32,992
...there is no ship now
that can bear me hence.

428
00:42:20,377 --> 00:42:23,088
We've just passed
into the realm of Gender.

429
00:42:34,893 --> 00:42:36,978
Minas Tirith.

430
00:42:37,687 --> 00:42:39,898
City of kings.

431
00:43:11,391 --> 00:43:13,101
Make way!

432
00:43:42,383 --> 00:43:44,218
It's the tree.

433
00:43:44,301 --> 00:43:45,886
Gandalf. Gandalf.

434
00:43:46,178 --> 00:43:48,306
Yes, the White Tree of Gender.

435
00:43:48,598 --> 00:43:50,391
The tree of the king.

436
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,186
Lord Denethor, however,
is not king.

437
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,981
He is a steward only,
a caretaker of the throne.

438
00:43:56,815 --> 00:44:00,194
Now listen carefully.
Lord Denethor is Boromir's father.

439
00:44:00,986 --> 00:44:04,615
To give him news of his beloved son's
death would be most unwise.

440
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:08,494
And do not mention Frodo or the Ring.

441
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:12,207
And say nothing of Aragorn either.

442
00:44:14,209 --> 00:44:17,921
In fact, it's better if you
don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.

443
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:54,419
Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion,
lord and steward of Gender.

444
00:45:00,217 --> 00:45:04,722
I come with tidings in this dark hour,
and with counsel.

445
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:09,102
Perhaps you come to explain this.

446
00:45:14,816 --> 00:45:19,196
Perhaps you come to tell me
why my son is dead.

447
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,715
Boromir died to save us...

448
00:45:37,007 --> 00:45:38,592
...my kinsman and me.

449
00:45:38,926 --> 00:45:42,221
-He fell defending us from many foes.
-Pippin.

450
00:45:47,894 --> 00:45:51,189
I offer you my service, such as it is...

451
00:45:52,023 --> 00:45:53,900
...in payment of this debt.

452
00:45:56,111 --> 00:45:59,197
This is my first command to you.

453
00:46:00,115 --> 00:46:03,410
How did you escape
and my son did not...

454
00:46:03,911 --> 00:46:06,122
...so mighty a man as he was?

455
00:46:06,998 --> 00:46:10,126
The mightiest man
may be slain by one arrow...

456
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:12,295
...and Boromir was pierced by many.

457
00:46:16,591 --> 00:46:18,218
Get up.

458
00:46:18,427 --> 00:46:22,806
My lord, there will be a time
to grieve for Boromir...

459
00:46:23,515 --> 00:46:25,101
...but it is not now.

460
00:46:25,893 --> 00:46:28,020
War is coming.

461
00:46:28,521 --> 00:46:32,692
The enemy is on your doorstep.
As steward, you are charged...

462
00:46:33,109 --> 00:46:37,114
...with the defense of this city.
Where are Gender's armies?

463
00:46:37,406 --> 00:46:42,119
You still have friends.
You are not alone in this fight.

464
00:46:42,494 --> 00:46:46,832
Send word to Théoden of Rohan.
Light the beacons.

465
00:46:48,626 --> 00:46:52,005
You think you are wise, Mithrandir.

466
00:46:52,297 --> 00:46:55,216
Yet for all your subtleties,
you have not wisdom.

467
00:46:57,427 --> 00:47:01,432
Do you think the eyes
of the White Tower are blind?

468
00:47:01,807 --> 00:47:04,727
I have seen more than you know.

469
00:47:05,019 --> 00:47:08,105
Wiith your left hand you would use me
as a shield against Mordor.

470
00:47:08,523 --> 00:47:11,234
And with your right
you'd seek to supplant me.

471
00:47:11,526 --> 00:47:15,030
I knowwho rides with Théoden of Rohan.

472
00:47:15,405 --> 00:47:21,120
Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears
of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

473
00:47:21,537 --> 00:47:26,125
And I tell you now, I will not bow
to this Ranger from the North...

474
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:30,797
... last of a ragged house
long bereft of lordship.

475
00:47:31,214 --> 00:47:36,720
Authority is not given to you
to deny the return of the king, steward.

476
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:41,433
The rule of Gender is mine
and no other's.

477
00:47:46,731 --> 00:47:48,399
Come.

478
00:47:56,408 --> 00:47:58,910
All has turned to vain ambition.

479
00:47:59,328 --> 00:48:02,623
He would even use his grief
as a cloak.

480
00:48:05,626 --> 00:48:08,212
A thousand years
this city has stood.

481
00:48:09,505 --> 00:48:11,841
Now, at the whim of a madman,
it will fall.

482
00:48:13,134 --> 00:48:15,220
And the White Tree,
the tree of the king...

483
00:48:15,428 --> 00:48:16,930
...will never bloom again.

484
00:48:17,222 --> 00:48:20,434
-Why are they still guarding it?
-They guard it because they have hope.

485
00:48:20,726 --> 00:48:23,729
A faint and fading hope
that one day it will flower.

486
00:48:24,104 --> 00:48:28,609
That a king will come
and this city will be as it once was...

487
00:48:29,026 --> 00:48:31,821
... before it fell into decay.

488
00:48:32,113 --> 00:48:35,242
The old wisdom borne out
of the West was forsaken.

489
00:48:35,408 --> 00:48:39,538
Kings made tombs more splendid
than the houses of the living...

490
00:48:40,038 --> 00:48:41,832
...and counted the old names
of their descent...

491
00:48:42,124 --> 00:48:44,710
...dearer than the names of their sons.

492
00:48:45,044 --> 00:48:49,841
Childless lords sat in aged halls,
musing on heraldry...

493
00:48:50,216 --> 00:48:55,305
...or in high, cold towers,
asking questions of the stars.

494
00:48:55,805 --> 00:48:59,434
And so the people of Gender
fell into ruin.

495
00:49:00,519 --> 00:49:02,813
The line of kings failed.

496
00:49:03,606 --> 00:49:05,816
The White Tree withered.

497
00:49:06,609 --> 00:49:10,613
The rule of Gender was given over
to lesser men.

498
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:22,710
Mordor.

499
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:26,839
Yes, there it lies.

500
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:31,010
This city has dwelt ever
in the sight of its shadow.

501
00:49:33,138 --> 00:49:34,723
A storm is coming.

502
00:49:35,515 --> 00:49:38,226
This is not the weather of the world.

503
00:49:38,518 --> 00:49:40,646
This is a device of Sauron's making.

504
00:49:40,938 --> 00:49:44,525
A broil of fume
he sends ahead of his host.

505
00:49:45,317 --> 00:49:47,612
The Orcs of Mordor
have no love of daylight...

506
00:49:47,945 --> 00:49:49,614
...so he covers the face of the sun...

507
00:49:49,947 --> 00:49:53,535
...to ease their passage
along the road to war.

508
00:49:53,827 --> 00:49:56,913
When the Shadow of Mordor
reaches this city...

509
00:49:57,831 --> 00:49:59,416
...it will begin.

510
00:50:01,126 --> 00:50:02,628
Well...

511
00:50:03,128 --> 00:50:04,421
... Minas Tirith...

512
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:07,717
...very impressive.

513
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:10,511
-So where are we off to next?
-Oh, it's too late for that, Peregrin.

514
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,847
There's no leaving this city.

515
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:18,437
Help must come to us.

516
00:50:20,022 --> 00:50:22,650
It must be getting near teatime.

517
00:50:22,816 --> 00:50:26,445
Leastways, it would be in decent places
where there is still teatime.

518
00:50:26,821 --> 00:50:30,241
We're not in decent places.

519
00:50:35,914 --> 00:50:37,124
Mr. Frodo?

520
00:50:40,127 --> 00:50:41,336
What is it?

521
00:50:43,923 --> 00:50:46,133
It's just a feeling.

522
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:50,722
I don't think I'll be coming back.

523
00:50:55,435 --> 00:50:57,854
Yes, you will. Of course you will.

524
00:50:58,522 --> 00:51:00,315
That's just morbid thinking.

525
00:51:00,816 --> 00:51:03,235
We're going there and back again...

526
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:05,654
...just like Mr. Bilbo.

527
00:51:06,739 --> 00:51:08,741
You'll see.

528
00:51:17,042 --> 00:51:20,420
I think these lands were once
part of the kingdom of Gender.

529
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:28,930
Long ago, when there was a king.

530
00:51:49,744 --> 00:51:52,455
Mr. Frodo, look.

531
00:51:54,249 --> 00:51:56,835
The king has got a crown again.

532
00:52:08,055 --> 00:52:12,143
Come on, Hobbits!
Mustn't stop now. This way.

533
00:52:29,245 --> 00:52:33,041
So I imagine this is just
a ceremonial position.

534
00:52:33,458 --> 00:52:37,546
I mean, they don't actually expect me
to do any fighting.

535
00:52:38,547 --> 00:52:41,633
-Do they?
-You're in the service of the steward now.

536
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:45,137
You'll have to do as you're told,
Peregrin Took.

537
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:51,728
Ridiculous Hobbit.

538
00:52:53,062 --> 00:52:55,148
Guard of the Citadel.

539
00:53:04,658 --> 00:53:06,452
Thank you.

540
00:53:15,962 --> 00:53:18,048
There's no more stars.

541
00:53:18,632 --> 00:53:19,841
Is it time?

542
00:53:21,051 --> 00:53:22,761
Yes.

543
00:53:25,431 --> 00:53:27,058
It's so quiet.

544
00:53:28,142 --> 00:53:32,146
It's the deep breath before the plunge.

545
00:53:33,565 --> 00:53:36,234
I don't want to be in a battle...

546
00:53:37,235 --> 00:53:42,032
... but waiting on the edge of one
I can't escape is even worse.

547
00:53:45,745 --> 00:53:49,248
Is there any hope, Gandalf,
for Frodo and Sam?

548
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:53,628
There never was much hope.

549
00:53:55,755 --> 00:53:57,466
Just a fool's hope.

550
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:06,058
Our enemy is ready.

551
00:54:06,434 --> 00:54:09,061
His full strength's gathered.

552
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:12,649
Not only Orcs, but Men as well.

553
00:54:12,857 --> 00:54:15,735
Legions of Haradrim from the south...

554
00:54:16,152 --> 00:54:18,739
...mercenaries from the coast.

555
00:54:19,031 --> 00:54:21,450
All will answer Mordor's call.

556
00:54:21,742 --> 00:54:23,244
Come on.

557
00:54:24,453 --> 00:54:27,665
This will be the end of Gender
as we know it.

558
00:54:27,832 --> 00:54:31,169
Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.

559
00:54:32,253 --> 00:54:36,341
If the river is taken,
if the garrison at Osgiliath falls...

560
00:54:36,758 --> 00:54:40,262
...the last defense of this city
will be gone.

561
00:54:40,637 --> 00:54:44,558
But we have the White Wiizard.
That's got to count for something.

562
00:54:50,565 --> 00:54:52,066
Gandalf?

563
00:54:55,862 --> 00:54:59,366
Sauron has yet to reveal
his deadliest servant...

564
00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:03,537
...the one who will lead
Mordor's armies in war.

565
00:55:03,954 --> 00:55:08,835
The one they say no living man can kill.

566
00:55:10,169 --> 00:55:12,255
The Wiitch King of Angmar.

567
00:55:13,339 --> 00:55:15,675
You've met him before.

568
00:55:16,468 --> 00:55:18,845
He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.

569
00:55:25,561 --> 00:55:28,147
He is the lord of the Nazgûl...

570
00:55:28,773 --> 00:55:31,067
...the greatest of the Nine.

571
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:34,738
Minas Morgul is his lair.

572
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:41,870
The Dead City.

573
00:55:42,162 --> 00:55:47,168
Very nasty place. Full of enemies.

574
00:55:54,676 --> 00:55:56,678
Quick. Quick.

575
00:55:56,970 --> 00:56:00,766
They will see. They will see.

576
00:56:10,151 --> 00:56:15,282
Come away. Come away.
Look, we have found it.

577
00:56:15,657 --> 00:56:19,369
The way into Mordor.

578
00:56:19,661 --> 00:56:23,874
The secret stair.

579
00:56:24,458 --> 00:56:26,752
Climb.

580
00:56:47,066 --> 00:56:49,652
-No, Mr. Frodo!
-Not that way!

581
00:56:54,658 --> 00:56:57,369
-What's it doing?
-No.

582
00:56:57,744 --> 00:57:00,747
-They're calling me.
-No.

583
00:57:30,446 --> 00:57:33,283
Hide! Hide!

584
00:58:16,955 --> 00:58:19,666
I can feel his blade.

585
00:58:31,471 --> 00:58:33,556
We come to it at last.

586
00:58:35,475 --> 00:58:38,270
The great battle of our time.

587
00:59:17,562 --> 00:59:20,691
Come away, Hobbits.
We climb. We must climb.

588
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:33,496
The board is set.

589
00:59:33,788 --> 00:59:36,166
The pieces are moving.

590
00:59:38,877 --> 00:59:41,380
Up, up, up the stairs we go.

591
00:59:41,797 --> 00:59:44,383
And then it's into the tunnel.

592
00:59:44,592 --> 00:59:47,678
Hey, what's in this tunnel?

593
00:59:48,262 --> 00:59:50,890
You listen to me,
and you listen good and proper.

594
00:59:51,266 --> 00:59:54,060
Anything happens to him,
you have me to answer to.

595
00:59:54,394 --> 00:59:55,896
One sniff something's not right...

596
00:59:56,188 --> 00:59:59,191
...one hair stands up
on the back of my head, it's over.

597
00:59:59,483 --> 01:00:02,069
No more slinker. No more stinker.

598
01:00:02,486 --> 01:00:04,989
You're gone. Got it?

599
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:07,867
I'm watching you.

600
01:00:13,373 --> 01:00:15,292
What was that about?

601
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,794
Nothing. Just clearing something up.

602
01:00:24,468 --> 01:00:27,263
Peregrin Took, my lad,
there is a task now to be done.

603
01:00:27,597 --> 01:00:31,893
Another opportunity for one
of the Shire-folk to prove their great worth.

604
01:00:36,982 --> 01:00:38,483
You must not fail me.

605
01:01:12,896 --> 01:01:15,774
It's been very quiet across the river.

606
01:01:16,066 --> 01:01:18,276
The Orcs are lying low.

607
01:01:18,568 --> 01:01:20,487
The garrison may have moved out.

608
01:01:21,697 --> 01:01:24,283
We've sent scouts to Cair Andros.

609
01:01:24,575 --> 01:01:27,787
If the Orcs attack from the north,
we'll have some warning.

610
01:01:53,189 --> 01:01:54,274
Quiet.

611
01:01:58,570 --> 01:02:00,405
We need 1 0 more.

612
01:02:21,804 --> 01:02:23,180
Kill him!

613
01:02:40,699 --> 01:02:42,993
They're not coming from the north.

614
01:02:44,411 --> 01:02:48,583
To the river. Quick. Quick.
Go. Come on.

615
01:02:52,212 --> 01:02:53,713
Faster.

616
01:03:06,894 --> 01:03:09,188
Draw swords.

617
01:04:03,914 --> 01:04:06,417
Hold! Hold them!

618
01:05:26,796 --> 01:05:28,589
What?

619
01:05:41,311 --> 01:05:42,604
Amon Dîn.

620
01:05:48,402 --> 01:05:51,322
The beacon.
The beacon of Amon Dîn is lit.

621
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:58,705
Hope is kindled.

622
01:07:31,431 --> 01:07:35,518
The beacons of Minas Tirith!
The beacons are lit!

623
01:07:36,937 --> 01:07:38,522
Gender calls for aid.

624
01:07:49,117 --> 01:07:51,828
And Rohan will answer.

625
01:07:52,412 --> 01:07:55,040
Muster the Rohirrim.

626
01:08:10,223 --> 01:08:12,100
Assemble the army at Dunharrow.

627
01:08:12,433 --> 01:08:16,521
As many men as can be found.
You have two days.

628
01:08:16,938 --> 01:08:22,027
On the third,
we ride for Gender and war.

629
01:08:23,237 --> 01:08:24,530
-Forward.
-Very good, sir.

630
01:08:24,738 --> 01:08:25,906
-Gamling.
-My lord.

631
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:27,742
Make haste
across the Riddermark.

632
01:08:28,034 --> 01:08:30,036
Summon every able-bodied man
to Dunharrow.

633
01:08:30,328 --> 01:08:31,829
I will.

634
01:08:35,917 --> 01:08:38,920
-Wiill you ride with us?
-Just to the encampment.

635
01:08:39,212 --> 01:08:43,008
It's tradition for the women
of the court to farewell the men.

636
01:08:49,807 --> 01:08:51,643
The men have found their captain.

637
01:08:51,809 --> 01:08:54,938
They will follow you into battle,
even to death.

638
01:08:55,313 --> 01:08:56,815
You have given us hope.

639
01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:02,029
Excuse me.

640
01:09:03,405 --> 01:09:04,824
I have a sword.

641
01:09:05,241 --> 01:09:06,534
Please accept it.

642
01:09:07,743 --> 01:09:12,040
I offer you my service, Théoden King.

643
01:09:15,627 --> 01:09:17,629
And gladly I accept it.

644
01:09:18,714 --> 01:09:22,635
You shall be Meriadoc,
esquire of Rohan.

645
01:09:27,723 --> 01:09:28,933
Horse-Men.

646
01:09:29,642 --> 01:09:35,023
I wish I could muster a legion of Dwarves,
fully armed and filthy.

647
01:09:35,607 --> 01:09:38,443
Your kinsmen may have no need
to ride to war.

648
01:09:38,819 --> 01:09:42,114
I fear war already marches
on their own lands.

649
01:10:00,717 --> 01:10:04,013
So it is before the walls
of Minas Tirith...

650
01:10:04,346 --> 01:10:08,017
...the doom of our time will be decided.

651
01:10:10,812 --> 01:10:16,151
Now is the hour.
Riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken.

652
01:10:16,526 --> 01:10:19,821
Now, fulfill them all.
To lord and land!

653
01:11:03,118 --> 01:11:04,954
Faramir!

654
01:11:11,336 --> 01:11:14,839
We can't hold them. The city is lost.

655
01:11:15,632 --> 01:11:18,635
Tell the men to break cover.
We ride for Minas Tirith.

656
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,647
Nazgûl.

657
01:11:32,150 --> 01:11:34,527
Take cover!

658
01:11:34,736 --> 01:11:37,239
Nazgûl!

659
01:11:37,447 --> 01:11:40,951
Fall back. Fall back to Minas Tirith!

660
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:49,544
Fall back!

661
01:11:56,635 --> 01:12:01,056
-Retreat! Retreat!
-Run for your lives!

662
01:12:25,541 --> 01:12:29,629
The age of Men is over.

663
01:12:30,046 --> 01:12:35,427
The time of the Orc has come.

664
01:12:38,055 --> 01:12:40,224
-Keep going.
-It's the Nazgûl.

665
01:12:41,934 --> 01:12:44,144
Take cover, my lord!

666
01:12:44,645 --> 01:12:45,938
It's coming!

667
01:12:51,444 --> 01:12:54,739
-It's Mithrandir.
-The White Rider!

668
01:13:34,866 --> 01:13:36,159
Pull!

669
01:13:53,928 --> 01:13:56,264
Mithrandir.

670
01:13:56,556 --> 01:13:58,266
They broke through our defenses.

671
01:13:58,433 --> 01:14:00,561
They've taken the bridge
and the west bank.

672
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:05,733
- Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river.
- lt is as the Lord Denethor predicted.

673
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:10,446
-Long has he foreseen this doom.
-Foreseen and done nothing.

674
01:14:14,034 --> 01:14:16,369
Faramir?

675
01:14:18,372 --> 01:14:22,042
This is not the first Half ling
to have crossed your path.

676
01:14:22,459 --> 01:14:24,545
No.

677
01:14:25,963 --> 01:14:27,340
You've seen Frodo and Sam?

678
01:14:28,341 --> 01:14:31,553
- Where? When?
- ln lthilien.

679
01:14:31,844 --> 01:14:33,847
Not two days ago.

680
01:14:34,472 --> 01:14:38,644
Gandalf, they're taking the road
to the Morgul Vale.

681
01:14:39,645 --> 01:14:42,147
And then the pass of Cirith Ungol.

682
01:14:44,567 --> 01:14:46,736
What does that mean?

683
01:14:47,069 --> 01:14:51,741
-What's wrong?
-Faramir, tell me everything.

684
01:14:52,158 --> 01:14:54,035
Tell me all you know.

685
01:14:55,370 --> 01:14:58,540
This is how you would serve your city?

686
01:14:58,874 --> 01:15:01,960
You would risk its utter ruin?

687
01:15:03,254 --> 01:15:04,755
I did what I judged to be right.

688
01:15:05,548 --> 01:15:08,342
What you judged to be right.

689
01:15:09,135 --> 01:15:14,849
You sent the Ring of Power into Mordor
in the hands of a witless Half ling.

690
01:15:19,062 --> 01:15:23,651
It should have been brought back
to the Citadel to be kept safe.

691
01:15:25,444 --> 01:15:26,862
Hidden.

692
01:15:27,446 --> 01:15:30,074
Dark and deep in the vaults...

693
01:15:30,366 --> 01:15:32,368
... not to be used.

694
01:15:36,665 --> 01:15:41,378
Unless at the uttermost end of need.

695
01:15:42,046 --> 01:15:43,964
I would not use the Ring.

696
01:15:44,256 --> 01:15:47,176
Not if Minas Tirith were falling in ruin
and I alone could save her.

697
01:15:47,677 --> 01:15:52,265
Ever you desire to appear lordly
and gracious...

698
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,768
...as a king of old.

699
01:15:56,645 --> 01:16:00,274
Boromir would have remembered
his father's need.

700
01:16:00,858 --> 01:16:03,277
He would have brought me a kingly gift.

701
01:16:03,569 --> 01:16:05,946
Boromir would not
have brought the Ring.

702
01:16:06,447 --> 01:16:09,450
He would have stretched out his hand to
this thing and taken it. He would've fallen.

703
01:16:09,742 --> 01:16:11,870
-You know nothing of this matter!
-He would have kept it for his own.

704
01:16:13,955 --> 01:16:15,957
And when he returned...

705
01:16:17,167 --> 01:16:18,752
...you would not have known your son.

706
01:16:19,044 --> 01:16:21,463
Boromir was loyal to me!

707
01:16:21,755 --> 01:16:24,175
Not some wizard's pupil!

708
01:16:32,559 --> 01:16:33,768
Father?

709
01:16:46,449 --> 01:16:48,284
My son.

710
01:17:14,646 --> 01:17:15,981
Leave me.

711
01:17:49,559 --> 01:17:51,978
Careful, master. Careful.

712
01:17:52,479 --> 01:17:55,273
Very far to fall.

713
01:17:57,984 --> 01:18:01,655
Very dangerous are the stairs.

714
01:18:04,450 --> 01:18:06,869
Come, master.

715
01:18:12,876 --> 01:18:15,879
Come to Sméagol.

716
01:18:22,386 --> 01:18:23,762
Mr. Frodo.

717
01:18:24,889 --> 01:18:26,390
Get back, you!

718
01:18:26,557 --> 01:18:28,684
Don't touch him!

719
01:18:32,856 --> 01:18:35,567
Why does he hates poor Sméagol?

720
01:18:35,859 --> 01:18:39,488
What has Sméagol ever done to him?

721
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:42,074
Master?

722
01:18:42,992 --> 01:18:46,287
Master carries heavy burden.

723
01:18:46,662 --> 01:18:51,793
Sméagol knows.
Heavy, heavy burden.

724
01:18:52,168 --> 01:18:55,255
Fat one cannot know.

725
01:18:57,466 --> 01:19:00,093
Sméagol look after master.

726
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:03,556
He wants it.

727
01:19:03,889 --> 01:19:08,186
He needs it.
Sméagol sees it in his eye.

728
01:19:08,478 --> 01:19:13,691
Very soon he will ask you for it.
You will see.

729
01:19:14,192 --> 01:19:17,863
The fat one will take it from you.

730
01:19:25,162 --> 01:19:29,375
Send forth all legions.

731
01:19:29,792 --> 01:19:33,588
Do not stop the attack
until the city is taken.

732
01:19:34,464 --> 01:19:37,467
Slay them all.

733
01:19:39,261 --> 01:19:44,892
-What of the wizard?
-I will break him.

734
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:50,773
Where are Théoden's riders?

735
01:19:51,065 --> 01:19:53,485
Wiill Rohan's army come?

736
01:19:53,777 --> 01:19:55,862
Mithrandir.

737
01:19:57,072 --> 01:20:00,784
Courage is the best defense
that you have now.

738
01:20:05,790 --> 01:20:08,376
What were you thinking, Peregrin Took?

739
01:20:10,586 --> 01:20:15,967
What service can a Hobbit
offer such a great lord of Men?

740
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:17,761
It was well-done.

741
01:20:21,098 --> 01:20:24,977
A generous deed should not
be checked with cold counsel.

742
01:20:25,895 --> 01:20:28,272
You are to join the tower guard.

743
01:20:28,981 --> 01:20:31,776
I didn't think they would find any livery
that would fit me.

744
01:20:32,193 --> 01:20:34,487
Once belonged to a young boy
of the city.

745
01:20:34,779 --> 01:20:36,281
A very foolish one...

746
01:20:36,490 --> 01:20:40,494
...who wasted many hours slaying dragons
instead of attending to his studies.

747
01:20:40,869 --> 01:20:43,497
-This was yours?
-Yes, it was mine.

748
01:20:43,789 --> 01:20:45,499
My father had it made for me.

749
01:20:46,667 --> 01:20:48,002
Well...

750
01:20:48,169 --> 01:20:50,088
... I'm taller than you were then.

751
01:20:50,296 --> 01:20:53,466
Though I'm not likely to grow anymore,
except sideways.

752
01:20:56,678 --> 01:20:58,597
Never fitted me either.

753
01:20:58,889 --> 01:21:01,600
Boromir was always the soldier.

754
01:21:04,687 --> 01:21:06,981
They were so alike, he and my father.

755
01:21:09,192 --> 01:21:10,777
Proud.

756
01:21:10,902 --> 01:21:12,070
Stubborn even.

757
01:21:13,988 --> 01:21:15,407
But strong.

758
01:21:16,992 --> 01:21:19,995
I think you have strength
of a different kind.

759
01:21:20,704 --> 01:21:22,998
And one day your father will see it.

760
01:21:27,378 --> 01:21:31,007
Here do I swear fealty
and service to Gender...

761
01:21:31,382 --> 01:21:32,801
... in peace or war...

762
01:21:33,468 --> 01:21:35,804
...in living or dying...

763
01:21:37,305 --> 01:21:38,473
...from....

764
01:21:41,185 --> 01:21:43,896
From this hour henceforth...

765
01:21:44,188 --> 01:21:45,981
... until my lord release me...

766
01:21:47,608 --> 01:21:49,694
...or death take me.

767
01:21:50,403 --> 01:21:52,781
And I shall not forget it...

768
01:21:53,072 --> 01:21:56,284
...nor fail to reward
that which is given.

769
01:22:04,001 --> 01:22:06,170
Fealty with love.

770
01:22:07,505 --> 01:22:09,006
Valour with honour.

771
01:22:10,675 --> 01:22:13,887
Disloyalty with vengeance.

772
01:22:22,688 --> 01:22:26,609
I do not think we should so lightly
abandon the outer defenses...

773
01:22:26,901 --> 01:22:29,612
...defenses that your brother
long held intact.

774
01:22:29,779 --> 01:22:32,198
-What would you have me do?
-I will not yield...

775
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:35,201
...the river in Pelennor unfought.

776
01:22:35,410 --> 01:22:36,995
Osgiliath must be retaken.

777
01:22:37,287 --> 01:22:39,206
My lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

778
01:22:39,998 --> 01:22:42,710
Much must be risked in war.

779
01:22:45,379 --> 01:22:49,175
Is there a captain here who still has
the courage to do his lord's will?

780
01:22:55,599 --> 01:22:58,685
You wish now that our places
had been exchanged...

781
01:22:59,811 --> 01:23:02,481
...that I had died
and Boromir had lived.

782
01:23:06,110 --> 01:23:07,778
Yes.

783
01:23:08,488 --> 01:23:10,615
I wish that.

784
01:23:19,082 --> 01:23:21,502
Since you were robbed
of Boromir...

785
01:23:23,379 --> 01:23:26,215
... I will do what I can
in his stead.

786
01:23:34,516 --> 01:23:38,687
If I should return,
think better of me, Father.

787
01:23:41,106 --> 01:23:44,485
That will depend on the manner
of your return.

788
01:25:07,909 --> 01:25:10,119
What are you up to?

789
01:25:10,411 --> 01:25:11,621
Sneaking off, are we?

790
01:25:12,413 --> 01:25:14,124
Sneaking?

791
01:25:15,208 --> 01:25:17,294
Sneaking?

792
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:21,924
Fat Hobbit is always so polite.

793
01:25:22,216 --> 01:25:27,013
Sméagol shows them secret ways
that nobody else could find...

794
01:25:27,388 --> 01:25:29,515
...and they say "sneak."

795
01:25:30,224 --> 01:25:32,602
Sneak?

796
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:36,022
Very nice friend.
Oh, yes, my precious.

797
01:25:36,314 --> 01:25:38,817
-Very nice, very nice.
-All right. All right!

798
01:25:40,194 --> 01:25:42,321
You just startled me is all.

799
01:25:42,905 --> 01:25:44,698
What were you doing?

800
01:25:46,409 --> 01:25:48,411
Sneaking.

801
01:25:48,911 --> 01:25:51,789
Fine. Have it your own way.

802
01:25:54,209 --> 01:25:56,628
I'm sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo.

803
01:25:57,003 --> 01:25:58,922
We have to be moving on.

804
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:05,721
It's dark still.

805
01:26:06,013 --> 01:26:08,099
It's always dark here.

806
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:14,314
It's gone!

807
01:26:15,607 --> 01:26:18,318
-The Elven bread.
-What?

808
01:26:18,610 --> 01:26:20,028
That's all we have left.

809
01:26:24,116 --> 01:26:26,494
He took it. He must have!

810
01:26:27,203 --> 01:26:30,331
Sméagol?
No, no, not poor Sméagol.

811
01:26:30,623 --> 01:26:33,293
Sméagol hates nasty Elf bread.

812
01:26:33,626 --> 01:26:36,630
You're a lying rat!
What did you do with it?!

813
01:26:37,005 --> 01:26:38,507
He doesn't eat it.

814
01:26:39,633 --> 01:26:41,802
-He can't have taken it.
-Look.

815
01:26:42,928 --> 01:26:44,597
What's this?

816
01:26:47,433 --> 01:26:50,603
Crumbs on his jacketses.
He took it!

817
01:26:51,521 --> 01:26:53,106
He took it.

818
01:26:54,024 --> 01:26:58,028
I seen him. He's always stuffing
his face when master's not looking.

819
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:00,030
That's a filthy lie!

820
01:27:00,322 --> 01:27:02,408
You stinking, two-faced sneak!

821
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:03,826
-Sam!
-Call me...

822
01:27:04,118 --> 01:27:05,327
Stop it!

823
01:27:06,412 --> 01:27:07,496
Sam!

824
01:27:08,915 --> 01:27:12,335
-I'll kill him!
-Sam! No!

825
01:27:13,628 --> 01:27:18,926
Oh, my... I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
to go so far. I was just so... So angry.

826
01:27:19,217 --> 01:27:21,303
Here, just...
Let's just rest a bit.

827
01:27:21,512 --> 01:27:23,514
-I'm all right.
-No.

828
01:27:23,806 --> 01:27:26,726
No, you're not all right.
You're exhausted.

829
01:27:27,018 --> 01:27:29,020
It's that Gollum.

830
01:27:29,312 --> 01:27:30,897
It's this place.

831
01:27:31,230 --> 01:27:33,733
It's that thing around your neck.

832
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:38,530
I could help a bit.

833
01:27:38,822 --> 01:27:41,325
I could carry it for a while.

834
01:27:41,617 --> 01:27:43,202
Carry it for a while.

835
01:27:43,535 --> 01:27:44,703
I could carry it... I could carry it.

836
01:27:45,413 --> 01:27:50,627
Share the load...Share the load...
the load...the load.

837
01:27:51,002 --> 01:27:52,212
Get away!

838
01:27:52,420 --> 01:27:53,922
I don't want to keep it.

839
01:27:57,634 --> 01:27:59,511
I just want to help.

840
01:28:01,638 --> 01:28:04,099
See? See?

841
01:28:04,433 --> 01:28:07,603
He wants it for himself.

842
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:09,605
Shut up, you!

843
01:28:10,315 --> 01:28:12,025
Go away!
Get out of here!

844
01:28:12,317 --> 01:28:14,027
No, Sam.

845
01:28:14,235 --> 01:28:15,403
It's you.

846
01:28:19,741 --> 01:28:21,410
I'm sorry, Sam.

847
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:24,413
But he's a liar.

848
01:28:24,705 --> 01:28:27,208
He's poisoned you against me.

849
01:28:28,709 --> 01:28:30,503
You can't help me anymore.

850
01:28:32,630 --> 01:28:34,424
You don't mean that.

851
01:28:37,010 --> 01:28:38,720
Go home.

852
01:29:58,849 --> 01:30:00,517
Faramir!

853
01:30:00,809 --> 01:30:02,645
Faramir!

854
01:30:04,146 --> 01:30:06,148
Your father's will has turned
to madness.

855
01:30:07,441 --> 01:30:09,444
Do not throw away your life
so rashly.

856
01:30:10,236 --> 01:30:12,447
Where does my allegiance lie
if not here?

857
01:30:13,114 --> 01:30:15,951
This is the city of the Men of Númenor.

858
01:30:16,743 --> 01:30:19,413
I will gladly give my life
to defend her beauty...

859
01:30:19,746 --> 01:30:22,750
...her memory, her wisdom.

860
01:30:25,252 --> 01:30:28,548
Your father loves you, Faramir.

861
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:32,343
He will remember it
before the end.

862
01:31:41,919 --> 01:31:43,420
Can you sing, Master Hobbit?

863
01:31:46,549 --> 01:31:47,925
Well...

864
01:31:48,551 --> 01:31:50,136
...yes.

865
01:31:50,929 --> 01:31:54,557
At least, well enough
for my own people.

866
01:31:56,226 --> 01:31:58,520
But we have no songs
for great halls...

867
01:31:59,855 --> 01:32:00,939
...and evil times.

868
01:32:01,940 --> 01:32:04,944
And why should your songs
be unfit for my halls?

869
01:32:07,822 --> 01:32:09,157
Come, sing me a song.

870
01:32:20,252 --> 01:32:23,422
Home is behind

871
01:32:23,756 --> 01:32:27,343
The world ahead

872
01:32:29,929 --> 01:32:35,560
And there are many paths to tread

873
01:32:37,562 --> 01:32:40,941
Through shadow

874
01:32:41,358 --> 01:32:45,362
To the edge of night

875
01:32:47,156 --> 01:32:52,036
Until the stars are all alight

876
01:32:55,248 --> 01:32:59,336
Mist and shadow

877
01:32:59,753 --> 01:33:03,841
Cloud and shade

878
01:33:06,427 --> 01:33:09,639
All shall fade

879
01:33:12,141 --> 01:33:15,937
All shall

880
01:33:21,860 --> 01:33:24,155
Fade

881
01:33:48,639 --> 01:33:51,935
March! March!

882
01:33:52,352 --> 01:33:57,357
March! March! March!

883
01:34:00,944 --> 01:34:03,155
Make way for the king.

884
01:34:04,865 --> 01:34:06,742
Make way.

885
01:34:09,370 --> 01:34:11,247
The king is here.

886
01:34:13,249 --> 01:34:14,751
My lord.

887
01:34:16,169 --> 01:34:17,963
Hail to you, sire.

888
01:34:18,547 --> 01:34:19,631
Grimbold, how many?

889
01:34:19,965 --> 01:34:22,259
I bring 500 men from the Westfold,
my lord.

890
01:34:23,344 --> 01:34:25,846
We have 300 more from Fenmarch,
Théoden King.

891
01:34:27,139 --> 01:34:30,935
-Where are the riders from Snowbourn?
-None have come, my lord.

892
01:34:48,162 --> 01:34:50,164
Six thousand spears.

893
01:34:51,374 --> 01:34:53,251
Less than half of what I'd hoped for.

894
01:34:53,668 --> 01:34:56,838
Six thousand will not be enough
to break the lines of Mordor.

895
01:34:59,758 --> 01:35:01,468
More will come.

896
01:35:01,844 --> 01:35:04,763
Every hour lost hastens Gender's defeat.

897
01:35:04,972 --> 01:35:07,475
We have till dawn,
then we must ride.

898
01:35:27,038 --> 01:35:29,248
The horses are restless...

899
01:35:29,540 --> 01:35:30,959
...and the men are quiet.

900
01:35:31,543 --> 01:35:34,546
They grow nervous in the shadow
of the mountain.

901
01:35:37,048 --> 01:35:38,842
That road there...

902
01:35:39,968 --> 01:35:41,970
...where does that lead?

903
01:35:42,763 --> 01:35:46,475
It is the road to the Dimholt,
the door under the mountain.

904
01:35:47,351 --> 01:35:50,271
None who venture there ever return.

905
01:35:51,439 --> 01:35:53,274
That mountain is evil.

906
01:36:16,258 --> 01:36:18,051
Aragorn.

907
01:36:18,969 --> 01:36:20,762
Let's find some food.

908
01:36:37,364 --> 01:36:38,657
There.

909
01:36:39,658 --> 01:36:42,578
A true esquire of Rohan.

910
01:36:46,374 --> 01:36:48,251
I'm ready.

911
01:36:49,877 --> 01:36:51,170
Sorry.

912
01:36:51,379 --> 01:36:53,548
It isn't all that dangerous.

913
01:36:54,174 --> 01:36:56,384
It's not even sharp.

914
01:36:57,177 --> 01:37:00,347
Well, that's no good. You won't kill
many Orcs with a blunt blade.

915
01:37:00,764 --> 01:37:02,182
Come on.

916
01:37:06,354 --> 01:37:08,773
To the smithy. Go!

917
01:37:10,358 --> 01:37:12,861
You should not encourage him.

918
01:37:13,069 --> 01:37:15,447
You should not doubt him.

919
01:37:15,780 --> 01:37:18,867
I do not doubt his heart,
only the reach of his arm.

920
01:37:21,662 --> 01:37:23,163
Why should Merry be left behind?

921
01:37:23,455 --> 01:37:25,958
He has as much cause
to go to war as you.

922
01:37:28,252 --> 01:37:31,256
Why can he not fight
for those he loves?

923
01:37:34,759 --> 01:37:37,554
You know as little of war
as that Hobbit.

924
01:37:38,847 --> 01:37:40,849
When the fear takes him...

925
01:37:41,183 --> 01:37:45,980
...and the blood and the screams
and the horror of battle take hold...

926
01:37:46,564 --> 01:37:48,649
...do you think he would stand and fight?

927
01:37:51,277 --> 01:37:52,862
He would flee.

928
01:37:53,071 --> 01:37:55,073
And he would be right to do so.

929
01:37:57,367 --> 01:38:01,163
War is the province of Men, Éowyn.

930
01:38:36,993 --> 01:38:40,581
I choose a mortal life.

931
01:38:43,667 --> 01:38:46,379
I wish I could've seen him...

932
01:38:47,588 --> 01:38:50,174
...one last time.

933
01:39:01,478 --> 01:39:02,855
Sir?

934
01:39:04,774 --> 01:39:07,193
King Théoden awaits you, my lord.

935
01:39:28,174 --> 01:39:29,967
I take my leave.

936
01:39:44,775 --> 01:39:45,985
My lord Elrond.

937
01:39:46,485 --> 01:39:49,864
I come on behalf of one whom I love.

938
01:39:53,159 --> 01:39:55,078
Arwen is dying.

939
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,796
She will not long survive the evil
that now spreads from Mordor.

940
01:40:04,797 --> 01:40:07,967
The light of the Evenstar is failing.

941
01:40:08,301 --> 01:40:12,096
As Sauron's power grows,
her strength wanes.

942
01:40:12,472 --> 01:40:16,101
Arwen's life is now tied
to the fate of the Ring.

943
01:40:16,977 --> 01:40:19,479
The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn.

944
01:40:19,897 --> 01:40:21,482
The end has come.

945
01:40:21,982 --> 01:40:24,485
It will not be our end, but his.

946
01:40:25,277 --> 01:40:28,781
You ride to war, but not to victory.

947
01:40:29,866 --> 01:40:33,369
Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith,
this you know.

948
01:40:33,787 --> 01:40:37,999
But in secret he sends another force
which will attack from the river.

949
01:40:38,667 --> 01:40:42,004
A fleet of Corsair ships sails
from the south.

950
01:40:42,671 --> 01:40:44,673
They'll be in the city in two days.

951
01:40:45,299 --> 01:40:47,969
You're outnumbered, Aragorn.

952
01:40:48,886 --> 01:40:50,888
You need more men.

953
01:40:51,389 --> 01:40:52,974
There are none.

954
01:40:54,768 --> 01:40:58,605
There are those who dwell
in the mountain.

955
01:41:07,782 --> 01:41:09,867
Murderers...

956
01:41:10,201 --> 01:41:11,494
...traitors.

957
01:41:13,997 --> 01:41:15,999
You would call upon them to fight?

958
01:41:16,291 --> 01:41:17,793
They believe in nothing.

959
01:41:18,085 --> 01:41:20,087
They answer to no one.

960
01:41:20,379 --> 01:41:23,299
They will answer
to the king of Gender.

961
01:41:30,598 --> 01:41:35,478
Andúril, the Flame of the West,
forged from the shards of Narsil.

962
01:41:49,994 --> 01:41:54,290
Sauron will not have forgotten
the Sword of Elendil.

963
01:42:08,473 --> 01:42:12,977
The blade that was broken
shall return to Minas Tirith.

964
01:42:13,395 --> 01:42:15,689
The man who can wield
the power of this sword...

965
01:42:16,106 --> 01:42:19,776
...can summon to him an army more
deadly than any that walks this earth.

966
01:42:21,695 --> 01:42:23,781
Put aside the Ranger.

967
01:42:24,073 --> 01:42:27,285
Become who you were born to be.

968
01:42:27,493 --> 01:42:29,412
Take the Dimholt road.

969
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:35,430
I give hope to the Dúnedain.

970
01:42:39,230 --> 01:42:43,440
I have kept no hope for myself.

971
01:42:55,607 --> 01:42:57,192
Why are you doing this?

972
01:42:57,776 --> 01:43:00,779
The war lies to the east.
You cannot leave on the eve of battle.

973
01:43:03,407 --> 01:43:05,284
You cannot abandon the men.

974
01:43:06,702 --> 01:43:08,204
Éowyn....

975
01:43:08,496 --> 01:43:10,581
We need you here.

976
01:43:11,791 --> 01:43:13,585
Why have you come?

977
01:43:15,378 --> 01:43:17,214
Do you not know?

978
01:43:26,599 --> 01:43:29,394
It is but a shadow and a thought
that you love.

979
01:43:33,481 --> 01:43:35,817
I cannot give you what you seek.

980
01:43:49,499 --> 01:43:53,211
I have wished you joy
since first I saw you.

981
01:44:12,482 --> 01:44:14,693
Just where do you think
you're off to?

982
01:44:14,985 --> 01:44:16,194
Not this time.

983
01:44:16,486 --> 01:44:18,613
This time you must stay, Gimli.

984
01:44:21,408 --> 01:44:24,119
Have you learned nothing
of the stubbornness of Dwarves?

985
01:44:24,411 --> 01:44:27,915
You might as well accept it.
We're going with you, laddie.

986
01:44:50,398 --> 01:44:52,484
-What's happening?
-Where is he going?

987
01:44:52,901 --> 01:44:54,694
Where's he going?

988
01:44:57,322 --> 01:44:59,324
I don't understand.

989
01:45:03,787 --> 01:45:05,498
Lord Aragorn!

990
01:45:05,998 --> 01:45:08,626
Why does he leave on the eve of battle?

991
01:45:10,003 --> 01:45:12,005
He leaves because there is no hope.

992
01:45:12,714 --> 01:45:14,799
He leaves because he must.

993
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:16,718
Too few have come.

994
01:45:16,802 --> 01:45:18,887
We cannot defeat
the armies of Mordor.

995
01:45:21,515 --> 01:45:23,100
No...

996
01:45:23,601 --> 01:45:24,810
...we cannot.

997
01:45:27,813 --> 01:45:31,401
But we will meet them
in battle nonetheless.

998
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:47,627
I have left instruction.

999
01:45:50,421 --> 01:45:53,508
The people are to follow
your rule in my stead.

1000
01:46:00,224 --> 01:46:02,393
Take up my seat in the Golden Hall.

1001
01:46:03,811 --> 01:46:06,522
Long may you defend Edoras...

1002
01:46:06,814 --> 01:46:09,025
... if the battle goes ill.

1003
01:46:10,193 --> 01:46:13,405
What other duty would you
have me do, my lord?

1004
01:46:15,907 --> 01:46:17,701
Duty?

1005
01:46:19,912 --> 01:46:21,205
No.

1006
01:46:29,630 --> 01:46:31,633
I would have you smile again...

1007
01:46:35,095 --> 01:46:39,933
...not grieve for those
whose time has come.

1008
01:46:44,897 --> 01:46:48,317
You shall live to see
these days renewed...

1009
01:46:52,822 --> 01:46:55,533
...and no more despair.

1010
01:47:01,707 --> 01:47:05,336
What kind of army would linger
in such a place?

1011
01:47:05,711 --> 01:47:07,421
One that is cursed.

1012
01:47:09,424 --> 01:47:11,801
Long ago, the Men of the Mountains
swore an oath...

1013
01:47:12,427 --> 01:47:15,096
...to the last king of Gender...

1014
01:47:15,722 --> 01:47:17,224
...to come to his aid...

1015
01:47:17,516 --> 01:47:19,101
...to fight.

1016
01:47:19,726 --> 01:47:21,812
But when the time came...

1017
01:47:22,521 --> 01:47:25,024
...when Gender's need was dire...

1018
01:47:25,316 --> 01:47:27,109
...they fled...

1019
01:47:27,401 --> 01:47:30,613
...vanishing into the darkness
of the mountain.

1020
01:47:31,823 --> 01:47:34,034
And so lsildur cursed them...

1021
01:47:35,619 --> 01:47:39,331
...never to rest until they had
fulfilled their pledge.

1022
01:47:43,836 --> 01:47:46,839
Who shall call them
from the grey twilight?

1023
01:47:47,423 --> 01:47:49,634
The forgotten people.

1024
01:47:49,926 --> 01:47:52,220
The heir of him to whom
the oath they swore.

1025
01:47:52,804 --> 01:47:54,639
From the north shall he come.

1026
01:47:55,223 --> 01:47:56,808
Need shall drive him.

1027
01:47:57,934 --> 01:48:01,313
He shall pass the door
to the Paths of the Dead.

1028
01:48:19,917 --> 01:48:23,003
The very warmth of my blood
seems stolen away.

1029
01:48:28,843 --> 01:48:30,637
The way is shut.

1030
01:48:31,512 --> 01:48:33,306
It was made by those
who are dead.

1031
01:48:34,140 --> 01:48:36,226
And the Dead keep it.

1032
01:48:36,810 --> 01:48:38,312
The way is shut.

1033
01:48:49,741 --> 01:48:51,117
Brego!

1034
01:48:54,704 --> 01:48:57,332
I do not fear death.

1035
01:49:09,846 --> 01:49:12,140
Well, this is a thing unheard-of.

1036
01:49:12,432 --> 01:49:16,812
An Elf will go underground
where a Dwarf dare not?

1037
01:49:17,229 --> 01:49:18,522
Oh.

1038
01:49:18,730 --> 01:49:21,442
Oh, I'd never hear the end of it.

1039
01:49:36,625 --> 01:49:38,710
We must ride light and swift.

1040
01:49:39,044 --> 01:49:40,712
It is a long road ahead.

1041
01:49:40,838 --> 01:49:43,841
And man and beast must reach the end
with the strength to fight.

1042
01:49:49,514 --> 01:49:52,308
Little Hobbits do not belong in war,
Master Meriadoc.

1043
01:49:52,809 --> 01:49:54,728
All my friends have gone to battle.

1044
01:49:55,020 --> 01:49:56,730
I would be ashamed to be left behind.

1045
01:49:57,022 --> 01:49:59,024
It is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith.

1046
01:49:59,316 --> 01:50:01,610
And none of my riders can bear you
as a burden.

1047
01:50:02,736 --> 01:50:04,738
I want to fight.

1048
01:50:05,322 --> 01:50:07,241
I will say no more.

1049
01:50:24,134 --> 01:50:26,012
Ride with me.

1050
01:50:27,513 --> 01:50:28,848
My lady.

1051
01:50:29,140 --> 01:50:31,434
Form up! Move out!

1052
01:50:31,726 --> 01:50:34,729
Form up! Move out!

1053
01:50:38,025 --> 01:50:39,151
Ride!

1054
01:50:39,318 --> 01:50:42,154
Ride now to Gender!

1055
01:51:23,949 --> 01:51:25,534
What is it?

1056
01:51:25,826 --> 01:51:27,328
What do you see?

1057
01:51:27,620 --> 01:51:29,747
I see shapes of men.

1058
01:51:32,417 --> 01:51:33,752
And of horses.

1059
01:51:34,628 --> 01:51:35,754
Where?

1060
01:51:35,921 --> 01:51:38,757
Pale banners like shreds of cloud.

1061
01:51:41,427 --> 01:51:43,554
Spears rise...

1062
01:51:44,221 --> 01:51:47,558
... like winter-thickets
through a shroud of mist.

1063
01:51:48,935 --> 01:51:51,020
The Dead are following.

1064
01:51:52,230 --> 01:51:53,732
They have been summoned.

1065
01:51:54,441 --> 01:51:56,234
The Dead?

1066
01:51:56,651 --> 01:51:58,320
Summoned?

1067
01:51:58,820 --> 01:52:00,656
I knew that.

1068
01:52:04,034 --> 01:52:05,619
Very good.

1069
01:52:06,454 --> 01:52:08,456
Very good! Legolas!

1070
01:52:46,455 --> 01:52:47,832
Do not look down.

1071
01:53:40,430 --> 01:53:45,352
Who enters my domain?

1072
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:51,568
One who will have your allegiance.

1073
01:53:54,529 --> 01:53:59,660
The Dead do not suffer the living to pass.

1074
01:54:00,244 --> 01:54:02,746
You will suffer me.

1075
01:54:26,439 --> 01:54:29,650
The way is shut.

1076
01:54:30,944 --> 01:54:35,240
It was made by those who are dead.

1077
01:54:35,866 --> 01:54:39,870
And the Dead keep it.

1078
01:54:49,046 --> 01:54:52,050
The way is shut.

1079
01:54:53,968 --> 01:54:56,471
Now you must die.

1080
01:55:00,476 --> 01:55:03,145
I summon you to fulfill your oath.

1081
01:55:03,646 --> 01:55:08,359
None but the king of Gender
may command me.

1082
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:16,243
That line was broken.

1083
01:55:18,954 --> 01:55:21,039
It has been remade.

1084
01:55:29,173 --> 01:55:30,675
Fight for us...

1085
01:55:30,758 --> 01:55:33,261
...and regain your honour.

1086
01:55:37,557 --> 01:55:38,767
What say you?

1087
01:55:51,155 --> 01:55:52,574
What say you?

1088
01:55:53,450 --> 01:55:55,160
You waste your time, Aragorn.

1089
01:55:55,368 --> 01:55:58,372
They had no honour in life,
they have none now in death.

1090
01:55:59,039 --> 01:56:01,458
I am lsildur's heir.

1091
01:56:02,042 --> 01:56:03,961
Fight for me...

1092
01:56:04,545 --> 01:56:08,049
...and I will hold your oaths fulfilled.

1093
01:56:12,053 --> 01:56:13,972
What say you?

1094
01:56:21,980 --> 01:56:24,066
You have my word!

1095
01:56:24,441 --> 01:56:28,279
Fight, and I will release you
from this living death!

1096
01:56:30,073 --> 01:56:31,449
What say you?!

1097
01:56:34,744 --> 01:56:37,581
Stand, you traitors!

1098
01:57:04,652 --> 01:57:05,653
Out!

1099
01:57:27,051 --> 01:57:28,553
Legolas!

1100
01:57:29,762 --> 01:57:30,972
Run!

1101
01:58:37,377 --> 01:58:39,379
We fight.

1102
01:58:49,766 --> 01:58:52,268
Open the gate! Quick!

1103
01:59:23,260 --> 01:59:25,179
Quick! Hurry!

1104
01:59:39,194 --> 01:59:40,696
Faramir!

1105
01:59:41,780 --> 01:59:44,867
Say not that he has fallen.

1106
01:59:46,160 --> 01:59:47,662
They were outnumbered.

1107
01:59:48,079 --> 01:59:49,580
None survived.

1108
01:59:50,373 --> 01:59:52,292
Fear.

1109
01:59:52,876 --> 01:59:55,962
The city is rank with it.

1110
01:59:58,590 --> 02:00:00,884
Let us ease their pain.

1111
02:00:01,260 --> 02:00:02,886
Release the prisoners.

1112
02:00:03,178 --> 02:00:05,097
Catapults!

1113
02:00:18,487 --> 02:00:21,782
My sons are spent.

1114
02:00:22,992 --> 02:00:25,786
My line has ended.

1115
02:00:28,664 --> 02:00:30,083
He's alive!

1116
02:00:30,291 --> 02:00:33,378
The House of Stewards has failed.

1117
02:00:33,586 --> 02:00:34,963
He needs medicine, my lord.

1118
02:00:36,089 --> 02:00:38,675
My line has ended!

1119
02:00:40,302 --> 02:00:42,179
My lord!

1120
02:00:55,777 --> 02:00:57,571
Rohan...

1121
02:00:58,405 --> 02:01:00,699
...has deserted us.

1122
02:01:15,298 --> 02:01:18,301
Théoden's betrayed me.

1123
02:01:29,605 --> 02:01:31,399
Abandon your posts!

1124
02:01:32,484 --> 02:01:36,196
Flee! Flee for your lives!

1125
02:01:46,582 --> 02:01:48,000
Prepare for battle!

1126
02:01:48,709 --> 02:01:51,671
Hurry, men! To the wall! Defend the wall!

1127
02:01:52,881 --> 02:01:54,799
Over here!

1128
02:01:55,675 --> 02:01:57,969
Return to your posts!

1129
02:02:08,898 --> 02:02:11,401
Send these foul beasts into the abyss.

1130
02:02:21,578 --> 02:02:22,997
Stay where you are.

1131
02:02:40,098 --> 02:02:41,475
We need more rubble!

1132
02:02:41,600 --> 02:02:43,394
Watch out!

1133
02:02:43,686 --> 02:02:46,105
Down to the lower levels. Quick!

1134
02:02:48,107 --> 02:02:49,609
Double up, men!

1135
02:03:58,684 --> 02:04:01,520
Hold them back! Do not give in to fear.

1136
02:04:02,104 --> 02:04:05,483
Stand to your posts! Fight!

1137
02:04:46,319 --> 02:04:47,820
Not at the towers!

1138
02:04:48,112 --> 02:04:50,990
Aim for the trolls! Kill the trolls!

1139
02:04:51,908 --> 02:04:53,702
Bring them down!

1140
02:05:28,906 --> 02:05:30,825
Fight them back!

1141
02:05:31,117 --> 02:05:32,994
Peregrin Took!

1142
02:05:33,912 --> 02:05:36,998
-Go back to the Citadel!
-They'd called us out to fight.

1143
02:05:52,724 --> 02:05:55,018
This is no place for a Hobbit.

1144
02:06:20,921 --> 02:06:22,297
Guard of the Citadel, indeed.

1145
02:06:23,007 --> 02:06:26,218
Now, back, up the hill. Quickly. Quick!

1146
02:06:37,731 --> 02:06:40,526
What are you doing,
you useless scum?!

1147
02:06:40,818 --> 02:06:42,611
The door won't give. It's too strong.

1148
02:06:49,118 --> 02:06:51,412
Get back there and smash it down.

1149
02:06:51,704 --> 02:06:53,623
But nothing can breach it.

1150
02:06:56,626 --> 02:06:58,795
Grond will breach it.

1151
02:07:02,299 --> 02:07:04,218
Bring up the wolf's head.

1152
02:07:07,513 --> 02:07:12,602
Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond!

1153
02:07:13,103 --> 02:07:16,815
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1154
02:07:19,026 --> 02:07:22,237
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1155
02:07:23,030 --> 02:07:26,534
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1156
02:07:27,118 --> 02:07:31,122
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1157
02:07:31,497 --> 02:07:35,001
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1158
02:07:56,300 --> 02:07:58,000
You may go no further.

1159
02:08:01,300 --> 02:08:04,100
You will not enter Gondor.

1160
02:08:04,600 --> 02:08:06,800
Who are you to deny us passage?

1161
02:08:07,100 --> 02:08:10,700
Legolas, fire a warning shot
past the bosun's ear.

1162
02:08:13,100 --> 02:08:14,700
Mind your aim.

1163
02:08:21,500 --> 02:08:23,800
That's it. Right. We warned you.

1164
02:08:24,100 --> 02:08:26,200
Prepare to be boarded.

1165
02:08:27,600 --> 02:08:28,800
Boarded?

1166
02:08:29,100 --> 02:08:30,600
By you and whose army?

1167
02:08:32,200 --> 02:08:34,400
This army.

1168
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:53,000
In there.

1169
02:08:54,700 --> 02:08:56,500
What is this place?

1170
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:04,300
Master must go inside the tunnel.

1171
02:09:05,800 --> 02:09:09,600
Now that I'm here, I don't think I want to.

1172
02:09:11,800 --> 02:09:14,000
It's the only way.

1173
02:09:16,500 --> 02:09:18,400
Go in...

1174
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,100
...or go back.

1175
02:09:23,900 --> 02:09:26,600
I can't go back.

1176
02:09:38,900 --> 02:09:41,400
-What's that smell?
-Orcses' filth.

1177
02:09:41,800 --> 02:09:44,900
Orcses come in here sometimes.

1178
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:51,800
Hurry.

1179
02:09:56,800 --> 02:09:58,600
This way.

1180
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:03,300
Sméagol?

1181
02:10:04,300 --> 02:10:06,400
Over here.

1182
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:17,800
It's sticky. What is it?

1183
02:10:18,200 --> 02:10:20,300
You'll see.

1184
02:10:20,600 --> 02:10:22,800
Oh, yes.

1185
02:10:23,100 --> 02:10:26,100
You will see.

1186
02:10:35,100 --> 02:10:36,700
Sméagol?

1187
02:10:38,100 --> 02:10:39,300
Sméagol!

1188
02:10:42,100 --> 02:10:43,900
Sméagol!

1189
02:10:53,300 --> 02:10:55,100
Sam.

1190
02:12:35,300 --> 02:12:37,300
And you, Frodo Baggins...

1191
02:12:37,600 --> 02:12:42,800
...I give you the light of Earendil,
our most beloved star.

1192
02:12:43,700 --> 02:12:46,900
May it be a light for you
in dark places...

1193
02:12:47,300 --> 02:12:50,900
...when all other lights go out.

1194
02:12:50,840 --> 02:12:54,678
Hail Eärendil brightest of the Stars!

1195
02:14:07,100 --> 02:14:10,200
Naughty little fly

1196
02:14:10,600 --> 02:14:13,600
Why does he cry?

1197
02:14:14,300 --> 02:14:17,500
Caught in a web

1198
02:14:17,800 --> 02:14:20,500
Soon you'll be....

1199
02:14:20,900 --> 02:14:22,700
Eaten.

1200
02:14:59,900 --> 02:15:02,500
Got away, did it, precious?

1201
02:15:02,800 --> 02:15:04,800
Not this time.

1202
02:15:05,100 --> 02:15:08,000
-Not this time!
-No!

1203
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:18,200
It wasn't us. It wasn't us!

1204
02:15:18,900 --> 02:15:21,400
Sméagol wouldn't hurt master.

1205
02:15:21,600 --> 02:15:23,500
We promised.

1206
02:15:23,600 --> 02:15:26,000
You must believe us.

1207
02:15:26,400 --> 02:15:28,000
It was the precious.

1208
02:15:28,200 --> 02:15:32,800
The precious made us do it.

1209
02:15:50,100 --> 02:15:52,900
I have to destroy it, Sméagol.

1210
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:05,200
I have to destroy it for both our sakes.

1211
02:16:15,600 --> 02:16:16,900
No!

1212
02:16:40,200 --> 02:16:42,500
I'm so sorry, Sam.

1213
02:16:47,100 --> 02:16:49,500
I'm so sorry.

1214
02:17:15,300 --> 02:17:19,900
This task was appointed to you,
Frodo of the Shire.

1215
02:17:21,300 --> 02:17:23,600
Ifyou do not find a way...

1216
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:26,100
...no one will.

1217
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,600
The scouts report
Minas Tirith is surrounded.

1218
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,200
The lower level's in flames.

1219
02:18:05,700 --> 02:18:08,100
Everywhere,
legions of the enemy advance.

1220
02:18:08,400 --> 02:18:09,500
Time is against us.

1221
02:18:10,200 --> 02:18:11,400
Make ready!

1222
02:18:11,600 --> 02:18:13,400
Take heart, Merry.

1223
02:18:13,600 --> 02:18:15,700
It will soon be over.

1224
02:18:16,400 --> 02:18:17,900
My lady...

1225
02:18:18,600 --> 02:18:21,100
...you are fair and brave...

1226
02:18:21,500 --> 02:18:23,800
...and have much to live for...

1227
02:18:25,300 --> 02:18:27,600
...and many who love you.

1228
02:18:30,500 --> 02:18:33,100
I know it is too late to turn aside.

1229
02:18:33,700 --> 02:18:36,800
I know there is not much point
now in hoping.

1230
02:18:38,200 --> 02:18:41,400
If I were a knight of Rohan,
capable of great deeds....

1231
02:18:41,700 --> 02:18:44,700
But I'm not.

1232
02:18:45,100 --> 02:18:46,800
I'm a Hobbit.

1233
02:18:49,600 --> 02:18:52,000
And I know I can't save Middle-earth.

1234
02:18:55,500 --> 02:18:57,700
I just want to help my friends.

1235
02:18:59,900 --> 02:19:01,300
Frodo.

1236
02:19:02,200 --> 02:19:03,900
Sam.

1237
02:19:05,500 --> 02:19:07,500
Pippin.

1238
02:19:09,100 --> 02:19:12,000
More than anything,
I wish I could see them again.

1239
02:19:16,400 --> 02:19:18,600
Prepare to move out!

1240
02:19:18,900 --> 02:19:21,500
Make haste.
We ride through the night.

1241
02:19:38,300 --> 02:19:39,600
To battle.

1242
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:41,400
To battle.

1243
02:20:04,500 --> 02:20:06,200
Back to the gate!

1244
02:20:06,600 --> 02:20:08,700
Hurry!

1245
02:20:28,700 --> 02:20:33,000
I am steward of the House of Anárion.

1246
02:20:33,300 --> 02:20:35,600
Thus have I walked.

1247
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,900
And thus now will I sleep.

1248
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,100
Gondor is lost.

1249
02:20:48,600 --> 02:20:51,900
There is no hope for Men.

1250
02:21:06,700 --> 02:21:09,400
Why do the fools fly?

1251
02:21:11,100 --> 02:21:14,100
Better to die sooner than late.

1252
02:21:16,300 --> 02:21:18,300
For die we must.

1253
02:21:30,600 --> 02:21:33,500
No tomb for Denethor
and Faramir.

1254
02:21:34,700 --> 02:21:40,400
No long, slow sleep of death embalmed.

1255
02:21:40,900 --> 02:21:45,800
We shall burn,
like the heathen kings of old.

1256
02:21:49,700 --> 02:21:51,400
Bring wood and oil.

1257
02:21:54,300 --> 02:21:55,600
Steady.

1258
02:21:55,900 --> 02:21:57,800
Steady.

1259
02:22:12,400 --> 02:22:14,800
You are soldiers of Gondor.

1260
02:22:15,100 --> 02:22:19,400
No matter what comes through that gate,
you will stand your ground.

1261
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:27,100
Run!

1262
02:22:29,100 --> 02:22:30,500
Volley!

1263
02:22:31,300 --> 02:22:33,100
Fire!

1264
02:24:26,400 --> 02:24:28,300
Let him go, you filth.

1265
02:24:30,400 --> 02:24:31,900
Let him go!

1266
02:24:33,300 --> 02:24:35,300
You will not touch him again.

1267
02:24:38,500 --> 02:24:40,300
Come on and finish it.

1268
02:26:30,200 --> 02:26:31,700
Back!

1269
02:26:42,600 --> 02:26:43,800
Mr. Frodo.

1270
02:26:53,500 --> 02:26:55,400
Oh, no.

1271
02:26:55,600 --> 02:26:57,400
Frodo.

1272
02:26:57,800 --> 02:26:59,600
Mr. Frodo.

1273
02:27:04,300 --> 02:27:05,600
Wake up.

1274
02:27:09,500 --> 02:27:11,800
Don't leave me here alone.

1275
02:27:13,400 --> 02:27:15,800
Don't go where I can't follow.

1276
02:27:20,100 --> 02:27:21,400
Wake up.

1277
02:27:28,200 --> 02:27:30,300
Not asleep.

1278
02:27:32,600 --> 02:27:34,400
Dead.

1279
02:27:53,200 --> 02:27:54,600
You get back, you scum!

1280
02:28:04,400 --> 02:28:05,600
What's this?

1281
02:28:06,900 --> 02:28:09,500
Looks like old Shelob's
been having a bit of fun.

1282
02:28:11,500 --> 02:28:13,900
Killed another one, has she?

1283
02:28:14,300 --> 02:28:16,200
No.

1284
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:20,900
This fellow ain't dead.

1285
02:28:21,200 --> 02:28:23,400
Not dead?

1286
02:28:23,700 --> 02:28:29,200
She jabs him with her stinger,
and he goes as limp as a boned fish.

1287
02:28:29,900 --> 02:28:32,500
Then she has her way with them.

1288
02:28:32,900 --> 02:28:34,600
That's how she likes to feed.

1289
02:28:35,200 --> 02:28:37,200
Fresh blood.

1290
02:28:37,500 --> 02:28:39,700
Get him to the tower!

1291
02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:44,800
Samwise, you fool.

1292
02:28:45,100 --> 02:28:47,800
This scum will be awake
in a couple of hours.

1293
02:28:48,100 --> 02:28:50,500
Then he'll wish he'd never been born.

1294
02:29:14,900 --> 02:29:18,000
The house of his spirit crumbles.

1295
02:29:19,200 --> 02:29:20,600
He is burning.

1296
02:29:21,800 --> 02:29:23,000
Already burning.

1297
02:29:23,500 --> 02:29:25,400
He's not dead.

1298
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:27,600
He's not dead!

1299
02:29:29,900 --> 02:29:31,600
No! No!

1300
02:29:31,800 --> 02:29:34,000
No! No!

1301
02:29:34,300 --> 02:29:36,200
He's not dead!

1302
02:29:36,700 --> 02:29:40,000
-Farewell, Peregrin, son of Paladin.
-No! No! No!

1303
02:29:40,300 --> 02:29:43,500
I release you from my service.

1304
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:49,200
Go now and die in what way
seems best to you.

1305
02:29:51,500 --> 02:29:53,700
Pour oil on the wood!

1306
02:29:55,500 --> 02:29:57,500
Come on, soldier! Move it!

1307
02:29:58,100 --> 02:30:00,900
-Hurry along there! Hurry along!
-Gandalf!

1308
02:30:01,300 --> 02:30:02,700
Where is Gandalf?

1309
02:30:03,900 --> 02:30:05,200
Gandalf!

1310
02:30:10,700 --> 02:30:11,800
Retreat!

1311
02:30:14,100 --> 02:30:15,700
The city is breached!

1312
02:30:15,900 --> 02:30:18,700
Fall back to the second level!

1313
02:30:22,700 --> 02:30:24,200
Get the women and children out!

1314
02:30:24,700 --> 02:30:26,300
Get them out!

1315
02:30:26,600 --> 02:30:28,000
Retreat!

1316
02:30:28,200 --> 02:30:29,900
Come on. Come on.

1317
02:30:30,300 --> 02:30:34,400
Move into the city. Kill all in your path.

1318
02:30:42,600 --> 02:30:44,900
Take them down!

1319
02:31:05,600 --> 02:31:08,300
Fight. Fight to the last man!

1320
02:31:08,600 --> 02:31:09,800
Fight for your lives!

1321
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:11,200
Gandalf!

1322
02:31:15,700 --> 02:31:17,000
Gandalf!

1323
02:31:17,200 --> 02:31:19,700
Denethor has lost his mind!

1324
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,200
He's burning Faramir alive!

1325
02:31:22,500 --> 02:31:24,200
Up! Quickly!

1326
02:31:31,100 --> 02:31:32,500
Go back to the abyss.

1327
02:31:34,100 --> 02:31:37,100
Fall into the nothingness
that awaits you and your master.

1328
02:31:37,500 --> 02:31:43,700
Do you not know death when you see it,
old man?

1329
02:31:44,100 --> 02:31:48,500
This is my hour.

1330
02:31:58,300 --> 02:31:59,800
Gandalf!

1331
02:32:08,700 --> 02:32:12,100
You have failed.

1332
02:32:13,100 --> 02:32:17,700
The world of Men will fall.

1333
02:33:15,300 --> 02:33:16,600
Courage, Merry.

1334
02:33:16,800 --> 02:33:19,100
Courage for our friends.

1335
02:33:22,800 --> 02:33:25,700
Form ranks, you maggots. Form ranks!

1336
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:29,100
Pikes in front. Archers behind.

1337
02:33:37,400 --> 02:33:40,400
Éomer, take your éored
down the left flank.

1338
02:33:40,700 --> 02:33:41,900
Flank ready.

1339
02:33:42,200 --> 02:33:44,900
Gamling, follow the king's banner
down the center.

1340
02:33:45,200 --> 02:33:48,700
Grimbold, take your company right
after you pass the wall.

1341
02:33:49,100 --> 02:33:51,700
Forth, and fear no darkness!

1342
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:55,700
Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden!

1343
02:33:56,000 --> 02:34:01,000
Spears shall be shaken,
shields shall be splintered...

1344
02:34:01,500 --> 02:34:05,000
...a sword-day, a red day...

1345
02:34:05,300 --> 02:34:08,700
...ere the sun rises!

1346
02:34:16,700 --> 02:34:20,800
Whatever happens, stay with me.
I'll look after you.

1347
02:34:27,300 --> 02:34:29,300
Ride now!

1348
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
Ride now!

1349
02:34:33,700 --> 02:34:36,300
Ride! Ride for ruin...

1350
02:34:36,600 --> 02:34:39,200
...and the world's ending!

1351
02:34:41,300 --> 02:34:42,600
Death!

1352
02:34:43,100 --> 02:34:45,900
Death!

1353
02:34:46,200 --> 02:34:49,300
-Death!
-Death!

1354
02:34:49,800 --> 02:34:51,300
-Death!
-Death!

1355
02:34:52,100 --> 02:34:55,400
-Death!
-Death!

1356
02:35:00,700 --> 02:35:03,000
Forth Eorlingas!

1357
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:47,700
Fire!

1358
02:35:51,700 --> 02:35:52,800
Death!

1359
02:35:57,100 --> 02:35:58,300
Charge!

1360
02:35:58,800 --> 02:36:00,300
Fire at will!

1361
02:36:57,800 --> 02:37:00,900
Set a fire in our flesh.

1362
02:37:18,600 --> 02:37:20,300
Stay this madness!

1363
02:37:24,800 --> 02:37:29,200
You may triumph in the field of battle
for a day...

1364
02:37:29,900 --> 02:37:33,400
...but against the power that has risen
in the east...

1365
02:37:33,600 --> 02:37:36,700
...there is no victory.

1366
02:38:06,200 --> 02:38:07,800
No!

1367
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,600
You will not take my son from me!

1368
02:38:10,900 --> 02:38:13,100
No! No!

1369
02:38:24,100 --> 02:38:25,700
Faramir.

1370
02:38:39,300 --> 02:38:43,100
So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion.

1371
02:39:10,800 --> 02:39:12,500
Drive them to the river!

1372
02:39:15,400 --> 02:39:17,300
Make safe the city!

1373
02:39:57,400 --> 02:39:59,200
Re-form the line!

1374
02:40:00,400 --> 02:40:02,300
Re-form the line!

1375
02:40:09,400 --> 02:40:11,900
Sound the charge! Take them head-on!

1376
02:40:12,700 --> 02:40:14,700
Charge!

1377
02:41:33,900 --> 02:41:35,200
Cut him down!

1378
02:42:01,900 --> 02:42:04,400
Take the reins. Pull him left!

1379
02:42:06,900 --> 02:42:08,100
Left!

1380
02:42:25,600 --> 02:42:27,200
Aim for their heads!

1381
02:42:33,300 --> 02:42:36,400
Bring it down! Bring it down!
Bring it down!

1382
02:42:50,400 --> 02:42:51,800
Merry!

1383
02:44:05,300 --> 02:44:07,300
I didn't think it would end this way.

1384
02:44:08,600 --> 02:44:10,000
End?

1385
02:44:11,300 --> 02:44:13,300
No, the journey doesn't end here.

1386
02:44:15,900 --> 02:44:18,900
Death is just another path...

1387
02:44:19,600 --> 02:44:21,200
...one that we all must take.

1388
02:44:22,600 --> 02:44:25,900
The grey rain curtain
of this world rolls back...

1389
02:44:26,200 --> 02:44:29,600
...and all turns to silver glass.

1390
02:44:31,900 --> 02:44:33,800
And then you see it.

1391
02:44:35,900 --> 02:44:38,100
What, Gandalf?

1392
02:44:39,300 --> 02:44:40,600
See what?

1393
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,100
White shores...

1394
02:44:45,800 --> 02:44:48,100
...and beyond.

1395
02:44:49,700 --> 02:44:51,400
A far green country...

1396
02:44:52,200 --> 02:44:55,000
...under a swift sunrise.

1397
02:44:59,200 --> 02:45:00,600
Well...

1398
02:45:00,800 --> 02:45:02,400
...that isn't so bad.

1399
02:45:02,700 --> 02:45:04,000
No.

1400
02:45:06,100 --> 02:45:07,700
No, it isn't.

1401
02:45:24,200 --> 02:45:27,400
Rally to me! To me!

1402
02:45:48,300 --> 02:45:52,700
Feast on his flesh.

1403
02:45:57,200 --> 02:45:59,400
I will kill you if you touch him.

1404
02:45:59,700 --> 02:46:04,900
Do not come between
the Nazgûl and his prey.

1405
02:47:14,300 --> 02:47:17,400
Late as usual, pirate scum!

1406
02:47:17,900 --> 02:47:20,000
There's knife-work here needs doing.

1407
02:47:20,300 --> 02:47:23,400
Come on, you sea rats!
Get off your ships!

1408
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:41,000
There's plenty for the both of us.

1409
02:47:41,300 --> 02:47:43,300
May the best Dwarf win.

1410
02:48:00,900 --> 02:48:03,000
You fool.

1411
02:48:03,300 --> 02:48:06,500
No man can kill me.

1412
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:12,000
Die now.

1413
02:48:22,900 --> 02:48:24,800
I am no man.

1414
02:48:41,400 --> 02:48:44,700
-Fifteen! Sixteen!
-Seventeen!

1415
02:48:52,700 --> 02:48:54,500
Merry!

1416
02:49:36,600 --> 02:49:38,300
Legolas!

1417
02:50:00,800 --> 02:50:03,100
Thirty-three, thirty-four.

1418
02:50:50,300 --> 02:50:52,500
That still only counts as one!

1419
02:50:52,800 --> 02:50:54,900
Come on, then. Come on!

1420
02:51:38,700 --> 02:51:41,400
I know your face...

1421
02:51:43,400 --> 02:51:45,200
...Éowyn.

1422
02:51:47,900 --> 02:51:50,100
My eyes darken.

1423
02:51:51,300 --> 02:51:52,600
No.

1424
02:51:53,500 --> 02:51:55,100
No.

1425
02:51:57,300 --> 02:51:59,700
I am going to save you.

1426
02:52:01,100 --> 02:52:03,300
You already did.

1427
02:52:07,100 --> 02:52:08,700
Éowyn...

1428
02:52:10,200 --> 02:52:12,600
...my body is broken.

1429
02:52:17,800 --> 02:52:20,100
You have to let me go.

1430
02:52:26,100 --> 02:52:28,500
I go to my fathers...

1431
02:52:30,200 --> 02:52:32,900
...in whose mighty company...

1432
02:52:33,400 --> 02:52:36,600
... I shall not nowfeel ashamed.

1433
02:52:53,300 --> 02:52:54,900
Éowyn.

1434
02:53:41,500 --> 02:53:43,800
Release us.

1435
02:53:45,900 --> 02:53:47,500
Bad idea.

1436
02:53:47,800 --> 02:53:51,500
Very handy in a tight spot, these lads,
despite the fact they're dead.

1437
02:53:51,700 --> 02:53:53,600
You gave us your word.

1438
02:53:55,500 --> 02:53:57,600
I hold your oath fulfilled.

1439
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:00,200
Go.

1440
02:54:01,200 --> 02:54:02,800
Be at peace.

1441
02:54:46,200 --> 02:54:48,100
Merry.

1442
02:54:48,700 --> 02:54:51,800
No!

1443
02:54:55,900 --> 02:54:58,200
No!

1444
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:25,700
With a sigh

1445
02:55:26,100 --> 02:55:29,600
You turn away

1446
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:33,800
With a deepening heart

1447
02:55:34,100 --> 02:55:38,600
No more words to say

1448
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:42,400
You will find

1449
02:55:42,800 --> 02:55:46,600
That the world has changed

1450
02:55:46,900 --> 02:55:50,900
Forever

1451
02:56:15,800 --> 02:56:23,200
And the trees are now
Turning from green to gold

1452
02:56:27,500 --> 02:56:32,600
And the sun is now fading

1453
02:56:32,900 --> 02:56:39,300
I wish I could hold you

1454
02:56:39,800 --> 02:56:42,300
Closer

1455
02:56:45,300 --> 02:56:46,500
Merry!

1456
02:56:48,200 --> 02:56:50,100
Merry!

1457
02:57:01,500 --> 02:57:03,300
Merry.

1458
02:57:05,900 --> 02:57:07,000
Merry, it's me.

1459
02:57:09,700 --> 02:57:11,100
It's Pippin.

1460
02:57:13,800 --> 02:57:15,900
I knew you'd find me.

1461
02:57:16,200 --> 02:57:17,400
Yes.

1462
02:57:19,800 --> 02:57:21,800
Are you going to leave me?

1463
02:57:22,500 --> 02:57:24,100
No, Merry.

1464
02:57:25,500 --> 02:57:27,600
I'm going to look after you.

1465
02:58:11,800 --> 02:58:13,100
Hands off!

1466
02:58:13,300 --> 02:58:16,300
That shiny shirt, that's mine.

1467
02:58:16,800 --> 02:58:20,700
It's going to the Great Eye,
along with everything else.

1468
02:58:22,400 --> 02:58:26,100
I don't take orders from
stinking Morgul-rats!

1469
02:58:27,100 --> 02:58:32,100
You touch it, and I'll stick
this blade in your gut.

1470
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:54,700
The scum tried to knife me.

1471
02:58:54,900 --> 02:58:56,600
Kill him!

1472
03:00:39,900 --> 03:00:41,800
That's for Frodo!

1473
03:00:42,300 --> 03:00:44,300
And for the Shire!

1474
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:50,100
And that's for my old Gaffer!

1475
03:01:19,700 --> 03:01:22,800
Stop your squealing, you dunghill rat.

1476
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:28,500
I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig.

1477
03:01:36,100 --> 03:01:37,700
Not if I stick you first.

1478
03:01:38,000 --> 03:01:39,400
Sam!

1479
03:01:44,600 --> 03:01:46,500
Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.

1480
03:01:46,800 --> 03:01:48,700
Sorry for everything.

1481
03:01:49,300 --> 03:01:52,800
-Let's get you out of here.
-It's too late. It's over.

1482
03:01:53,100 --> 03:01:55,900
They've taken it. Sam...

1483
03:01:56,800 --> 03:01:58,300
...they took the Ring.

1484
03:01:59,100 --> 03:02:01,700
Begging your pardon, but they haven't.

1485
03:02:13,800 --> 03:02:15,900
I thought I'd lost you.

1486
03:02:16,400 --> 03:02:18,000
So I took it.

1487
03:02:19,200 --> 03:02:21,200
Only for safekeeping.

1488
03:02:22,500 --> 03:02:24,200
Give it to me.

1489
03:02:27,800 --> 03:02:29,900
Give me the Ring, Sam.

1490
03:02:34,700 --> 03:02:35,900
Sam.

1491
03:02:37,500 --> 03:02:39,400
Give me the Ring.

1492
03:03:00,300 --> 03:03:01,500
You must understand.

1493
03:03:05,100 --> 03:03:06,800
The Ring is my burden.

1494
03:03:08,100 --> 03:03:10,100
It will destroy you, Sam.

1495
03:03:13,400 --> 03:03:15,200
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1496
03:03:16,600 --> 03:03:18,200
We best find you some clothes.

1497
03:03:18,500 --> 03:03:21,400
You can't go walking through Mordor
in naught but your skin.

1498
03:03:43,200 --> 03:03:45,300
We did it, Mr. Frodo.

1499
03:03:45,900 --> 03:03:48,100
We made it to Mordor.

1500
03:03:49,600 --> 03:03:51,200
There are so many of them.

1501
03:03:52,200 --> 03:03:54,700
We'll never get through unseen.

1502
03:03:59,900 --> 03:04:03,100
It's him, the Eye.

1503
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:13,500
We have to go in there, Mr. Frodo.

1504
03:04:14,100 --> 03:04:16,000
There's nothing for it.

1505
03:04:19,100 --> 03:04:23,300
Come on. Let's just make it
down the hill for starters.

1506
03:04:32,900 --> 03:04:36,000
Frodo has passed beyond my sight.

1507
03:04:37,400 --> 03:04:40,100
The darkness is deepening.

1508
03:04:40,500 --> 03:04:42,800
If Sauron had the Ring,
we would know it.

1509
03:04:43,000 --> 03:04:45,000
It's only a matter of time.

1510
03:04:46,500 --> 03:04:48,800
He has suffered a defeat, yes...

1511
03:04:50,100 --> 03:04:54,400
... but behind the walls of Mordor,
our enemy is regrouping.

1512
03:04:54,600 --> 03:04:56,400
Let him stay there.

1513
03:04:56,700 --> 03:04:59,200
Let him rot! Why should we care?

1514
03:04:59,500 --> 03:05:04,400
Because 10,000 Orcs now stand
between Frodo and Mount Doom.

1515
03:05:11,400 --> 03:05:13,800
I've sent him to his death.

1516
03:05:15,500 --> 03:05:16,700
No.

1517
03:05:17,300 --> 03:05:19,600
There is still hope for Frodo.

1518
03:05:20,100 --> 03:05:24,000
He needs time and safe passage
across the plains of Gorgoroth.

1519
03:05:25,300 --> 03:05:27,700
-We can give him that.
-How?

1520
03:05:28,200 --> 03:05:30,700
Draw out Sauron's armies.

1521
03:05:31,000 --> 03:05:33,000
Empty his lands.

1522
03:05:33,400 --> 03:05:36,300
Then we gather our full strength
and march on the Black Gate.

1523
03:05:37,100 --> 03:05:40,000
We cannot achieve victory
through strength of arms.

1524
03:05:40,300 --> 03:05:41,800
Not for ourselves.

1525
03:05:42,100 --> 03:05:47,400
But we can give Frodo his chance
if we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us.

1526
03:05:49,500 --> 03:05:53,100
Keep him blind to all else that moves.

1527
03:05:54,000 --> 03:05:55,200
A diversion.

1528
03:05:55,300 --> 03:05:57,000
Certainty of death...

1529
03:05:57,300 --> 03:05:59,900
...small chance of success...

1530
03:06:01,000 --> 03:06:02,500
...what are we waiting for?

1531
03:06:03,100 --> 03:06:05,400
Sauron will suspect a trap.

1532
03:06:06,400 --> 03:06:08,300
He will not take the bait.

1533
03:06:09,900 --> 03:06:12,200
Oh, I think he will.

1534
03:06:46,800 --> 03:06:49,300
Long have you hunted me.

1535
03:06:50,300 --> 03:06:51,500
Long have I eluded you.

1536
03:06:53,400 --> 03:06:54,900
No more.

1537
03:06:56,700 --> 03:06:59,000
Behold the Sword of Elendil.

1538
03:07:43,700 --> 03:07:46,100
The city has fallen silent.

1539
03:07:47,800 --> 03:07:50,700
There is no warmth left in the sun.

1540
03:07:51,700 --> 03:07:53,300
It grows so cold.

1541
03:07:56,400 --> 03:07:59,300
It's just the damp
of the first spring rain.

1542
03:08:05,800 --> 03:08:08,900
I do not believe this darkness
will endure.

1543
03:08:37,700 --> 03:08:39,100
Look, the Orcs...

1544
03:08:39,800 --> 03:08:41,700
...they're moving off.

1545
03:08:42,800 --> 03:08:44,800
You see, Mr. Frodo...

1546
03:08:45,100 --> 03:08:47,300
...some luck at last.

1547
03:08:47,600 --> 03:08:49,300
Move it, you slugs!

1548
03:08:50,700 --> 03:08:53,900
Come on! Faster!

1549
03:09:02,100 --> 03:09:05,200
Come along, you scum....

1550
03:09:05,500 --> 03:09:09,500
I'll whip you down to the bone, you....

1551
03:09:12,600 --> 03:09:14,100
Come on!

1552
03:09:14,400 --> 03:09:16,600
What have I told you?!

1553
03:09:23,500 --> 03:09:24,900
Get up!

1554
03:09:25,400 --> 03:09:28,000
Come on, you slugs!

1555
03:09:28,200 --> 03:09:31,700
You two are going straight
to the front line!

1556
03:09:32,100 --> 03:09:36,800
Now, move it! Go on!
Fall in! Move it!

1557
03:09:49,900 --> 03:09:53,600
To the Gate, you slugs!
Now, move it!

1558
03:10:03,200 --> 03:10:06,600
Don't you know we're at war?

1559
03:10:29,100 --> 03:10:31,800
Company, halt!

1560
03:10:35,800 --> 03:10:39,000
Inspection!

1561
03:10:39,300 --> 03:10:41,600
Sam, help me.

1562
03:10:41,900 --> 03:10:43,700
Mr. Frodo!

1563
03:10:46,500 --> 03:10:48,900
Stand up, Mr. Frodo.
Stand up!

1564
03:10:49,200 --> 03:10:50,900
It's so heavy.

1565
03:11:00,200 --> 03:11:01,300
Oh, no.

1566
03:11:07,000 --> 03:11:08,900
What do I do?
What do we do?

1567
03:11:12,100 --> 03:11:13,200
-Hit me.
-What?

1568
03:11:13,300 --> 03:11:15,300
Hit me, Sam. Start fighting.

1569
03:11:15,600 --> 03:11:17,100
Get off of me!

1570
03:11:17,800 --> 03:11:20,000
Nobody pushes me, you filthy maggot.

1571
03:11:28,800 --> 03:11:30,800
Get off of me!

1572
03:11:31,800 --> 03:11:33,600
Break it up! Break it up!

1573
03:11:36,300 --> 03:11:40,600
Oi! I'll have your guts if you don't
shut this rabble down!

1574
03:11:41,000 --> 03:11:43,200
Go, Sam. Now!

1575
03:11:52,200 --> 03:11:53,700
Move along, scum!

1576
03:11:54,000 --> 03:11:55,800
Back in the line!

1577
03:11:56,400 --> 03:11:58,100
You maggots!

1578
03:11:58,800 --> 03:12:01,700
Get back into the line,
you slugs!

1579
03:12:04,200 --> 03:12:07,500
Dig it, you slugs. Move it.

1580
03:12:10,500 --> 03:12:12,300
Move it!

1581
03:12:56,600 --> 03:12:58,500
I can't....

1582
03:12:58,700 --> 03:13:02,300
I can't....
I can't manage the Ring, Sam.

1583
03:13:02,700 --> 03:13:03,700
It's.... It's....

1584
03:13:04,000 --> 03:13:06,500
It's such a weight to carry.

1585
03:13:07,400 --> 03:13:08,400
It....

1586
03:13:08,600 --> 03:13:10,500
Such a weight.

1587
03:13:15,600 --> 03:13:17,900
We're going that way.
Straight as we can.

1588
03:13:19,500 --> 03:13:22,500
There's no point carrying anything
we're not sure to need.

1589
03:13:37,800 --> 03:13:39,500
Mr. Frodo.

1590
03:13:41,200 --> 03:13:42,600
Look.

1591
03:13:45,200 --> 03:13:46,900
There is light...

1592
03:13:47,400 --> 03:13:49,700
...and beauty up there...

1593
03:13:49,900 --> 03:13:51,600
...that no shadow can touch.

1594
03:14:42,700 --> 03:14:44,300
Take mine.

1595
03:14:44,900 --> 03:14:46,900
There's a few drops left.

1596
03:15:02,200 --> 03:15:04,700
There will be none left
for the return journey.

1597
03:15:05,700 --> 03:15:08,700
I don't think there will be
a return journey, Mr. Frodo.

1598
03:16:01,700 --> 03:16:03,800
Frodo, get down!

1599
03:16:05,700 --> 03:16:07,500
Hide!

1600
03:16:17,800 --> 03:16:19,700
Frodo!

1601
03:16:25,600 --> 03:16:27,000
Where are they?

1602
03:17:03,100 --> 03:17:06,000
Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth!

1603
03:17:07,100 --> 03:17:09,800
Let justice be done upon him!

1604
03:17:53,400 --> 03:17:57,200
My master, Sauron the Great,
bids thee welcome.

1605
03:18:03,200 --> 03:18:06,800
Is there any in this rout
with authority to treat with me?

1606
03:18:07,300 --> 03:18:10,300
We do not come to treat with Sauron...

1607
03:18:10,600 --> 03:18:13,400
...faithless and accursed.

1608
03:18:13,700 --> 03:18:17,000
Tell your master this:
The armies of Mordor must disband.

1609
03:18:17,300 --> 03:18:19,900
He is to depart these lands,
never to return.

1610
03:18:21,000 --> 03:18:23,400
Old Greybeard.

1611
03:18:25,000 --> 03:18:29,100
I have a token I was bidden
to show thee.

1612
03:18:34,300 --> 03:18:35,600
Frodo.

1613
03:18:38,400 --> 03:18:39,800
Frodo.

1614
03:18:40,900 --> 03:18:42,000
-Silence.
-No!

1615
03:18:42,900 --> 03:18:44,200
Silence!

1616
03:18:46,000 --> 03:18:49,600
The Halfling was dear to thee, I see.

1617
03:18:50,800 --> 03:18:54,700
Know that he suffered greatly
at the hands of his host.

1618
03:19:00,400 --> 03:19:05,900
Who would've thought one so small
could endure so much pain?

1619
03:19:08,800 --> 03:19:10,900
And he did, Gandalf.

1620
03:19:11,100 --> 03:19:12,800
He did.

1621
03:19:19,800 --> 03:19:21,300
And who is this?

1622
03:19:21,500 --> 03:19:23,500
Isildur's heir?

1623
03:19:23,800 --> 03:19:26,700
It takes more to make a king
than a broken Elvish blade.

1624
03:19:31,500 --> 03:19:34,000
I guess that concludes negotiations.

1625
03:19:36,300 --> 03:19:37,400
I do not believe it.

1626
03:19:39,400 --> 03:19:40,700
I will not.

1627
03:19:56,900 --> 03:19:58,600
Pull back.

1628
03:19:59,000 --> 03:20:00,900
Pull back!

1629
03:20:13,300 --> 03:20:15,200
It's gone, Mr. Frodo.

1630
03:20:17,800 --> 03:20:20,700
The light's passed on,
away towards the north.

1631
03:20:21,000 --> 03:20:22,700
Something's drawn its gaze.

1632
03:20:40,300 --> 03:20:42,900
Hold your ground! Hold your ground.

1633
03:20:45,100 --> 03:20:49,000
Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers!

1634
03:20:52,000 --> 03:20:53,800
I see in your eyes...

1635
03:20:54,300 --> 03:20:58,200
...the same fear that would take
the heart of me.

1636
03:21:00,300 --> 03:21:04,000
A day may come
when the courage of Men fails...

1637
03:21:04,400 --> 03:21:07,500
...when we forsake our friends
and break all bonds of fellowship.

1638
03:21:07,800 --> 03:21:10,400
But it is not this day.

1639
03:21:10,800 --> 03:21:13,700
An hour of wolves
and shattered shields...

1640
03:21:14,000 --> 03:21:16,800
...when the age of Men
comes crashing down.

1641
03:21:17,000 --> 03:21:19,400
But it is not this day.

1642
03:21:19,700 --> 03:21:21,200
This day we fight!

1643
03:21:23,800 --> 03:21:27,300
By all that you hold dear
on this good earth...

1644
03:21:27,700 --> 03:21:31,800
... I bid you stand, Men of the West!

1645
03:23:00,300 --> 03:23:03,700
Never thought I'd die fighting
side by side with an Elf.

1646
03:23:04,400 --> 03:23:06,600
What about side by side with a friend?

1647
03:23:10,300 --> 03:23:12,000
Aye.

1648
03:23:12,900 --> 03:23:14,600
I could do that.

1649
03:23:45,000 --> 03:23:47,000
Do you remember the Shire,
Mr. Frodo?

1650
03:23:50,000 --> 03:23:52,200
It'll be spring soon.

1651
03:23:53,000 --> 03:23:55,600
And the orchards will be in blossom.

1652
03:23:55,900 --> 03:23:59,400
And the birds will be nesting
in the hazel thicket.

1653
03:24:00,900 --> 03:24:04,800
And they'll be sowing
the summer barley in the lower fields...

1654
03:24:06,000 --> 03:24:10,200
...and eating the first
of the strawberries with cream.

1655
03:24:12,300 --> 03:24:14,700
Do you remember
the taste of strawberries?

1656
03:24:16,400 --> 03:24:18,100
No, Sam.

1657
03:24:18,200 --> 03:24:21,100
I can't recall the taste of food...

1658
03:24:22,400 --> 03:24:25,500
... nor the sound of water...

1659
03:24:25,800 --> 03:24:29,200
... nor the touch of grass.

1660
03:24:30,300 --> 03:24:31,800
I'm...

1661
03:24:32,800 --> 03:24:34,100
...naked in the dark.

1662
03:24:35,900 --> 03:24:38,100
There's-- There's nothing.

1663
03:24:38,200 --> 03:24:42,700
No veil between me
and the wheel of fire.

1664
03:24:44,300 --> 03:24:46,100
I can see him...

1665
03:24:46,600 --> 03:24:48,200
...with my waking eyes.

1666
03:24:49,300 --> 03:24:51,600
Then let us be rid of it...

1667
03:24:52,300 --> 03:24:54,500
...once and for all.

1668
03:24:55,300 --> 03:24:57,200
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1669
03:24:57,500 --> 03:25:00,000
I can't carry it for you...

1670
03:25:00,600 --> 03:25:02,600
...but I can carry you.

1671
03:25:03,200 --> 03:25:04,900
Come on!

1672
03:25:35,400 --> 03:25:38,200
Aragorn.

1673
03:25:49,900 --> 03:25:52,400
Elessar.

1674
03:26:04,500 --> 03:26:06,800
For Frodo.

1675
03:26:41,800 --> 03:26:43,200
Look, Mr. Frodo.

1676
03:26:44,000 --> 03:26:46,100
A doorway.

1677
03:26:46,800 --> 03:26:48,400
We're almost there.

1678
03:26:50,900 --> 03:26:54,600
Clever Hobbits to climb so high!

1679
03:27:08,700 --> 03:27:10,300
Mustn't go that way.

1680
03:27:11,900 --> 03:27:14,200
Mustn't hurt the precious.

1681
03:27:14,500 --> 03:27:16,200
You swore!

1682
03:27:16,500 --> 03:27:18,400
You swore on the precious!

1683
03:27:20,500 --> 03:27:22,300
Sméagol promised!

1684
03:27:23,300 --> 03:27:25,200
Sméagol lied.

1685
03:28:17,800 --> 03:28:19,600
Frodo!

1686
03:28:46,800 --> 03:28:48,500
Eagles.

1687
03:28:49,900 --> 03:28:51,400
The eagles are coming!

1688
03:29:14,300 --> 03:29:16,000
Frodo!

1689
03:29:21,400 --> 03:29:22,600
I'm here, Sam.

1690
03:29:30,200 --> 03:29:31,700
Destroy it!

1691
03:29:42,400 --> 03:29:45,500
Go on! Now!

1692
03:29:45,800 --> 03:29:48,200
Throw it in the fire!

1693
03:30:01,800 --> 03:30:04,300
What are you waiting for?

1694
03:30:06,300 --> 03:30:08,600
Just let it go!

1695
03:30:41,900 --> 03:30:44,000
The Ring is mine.

1696
03:30:47,700 --> 03:30:49,400
No.

1697
03:30:49,800 --> 03:30:51,000
No.

1698
03:30:59,500 --> 03:31:02,100
No!

1699
03:32:46,600 --> 03:32:48,400
Yes!

1700
03:32:49,700 --> 03:32:51,300
Yes!

1701
03:32:52,600 --> 03:32:55,300
Precious! Precious!

1702
03:32:55,600 --> 03:32:58,600
Precious! Precious!

1703
03:33:51,700 --> 03:33:53,400
Give me your hand!

1704
03:34:01,900 --> 03:34:04,200
Take my hand!

1705
03:34:06,900 --> 03:34:08,200
No!

1706
03:34:15,600 --> 03:34:17,400
Don't you let go.

1707
03:34:22,100 --> 03:34:23,600
Don't let go.

1708
03:34:25,300 --> 03:34:26,700
Reach!

1709
03:35:56,000 --> 03:35:58,700
Frodo!

1710
03:35:59,400 --> 03:36:02,200
Frodo!

1711
03:37:23,800 --> 03:37:25,500
It's gone.

1712
03:37:30,000 --> 03:37:31,700
It's done.

1713
03:37:32,300 --> 03:37:34,200
Yes, Mr. Frodo.

1714
03:37:35,600 --> 03:37:37,900
It's over now.

1715
03:38:03,800 --> 03:38:06,000
I can see the Shire.

1716
03:38:08,400 --> 03:38:10,600
The Brandywine River.

1717
03:38:12,800 --> 03:38:14,700
Bag End.

1718
03:38:17,100 --> 03:38:19,700
Gandalf's fireworks.

1719
03:38:20,300 --> 03:38:23,900
The lights in the Party Tree.

1720
03:38:25,500 --> 03:38:28,500
Rosie Cotton dancing.

1721
03:38:29,800 --> 03:38:32,400
She had ribbons in her hair.

1722
03:38:35,400 --> 03:38:38,200
If ever I was to marry someone...

1723
03:38:39,200 --> 03:38:41,400
... it would've been her.

1724
03:38:43,000 --> 03:38:44,900
It would've been her.

1725
03:38:57,200 --> 03:39:00,300
I'm glad to be with you,
Samwise Gamgee...

1726
03:39:04,700 --> 03:39:07,500
...here at the end of all things.

1727
03:40:57,300 --> 03:40:59,200
Gandalf?

1728
03:41:19,000 --> 03:41:20,900
Frodo!

1729
03:41:40,800 --> 03:41:42,500
Gimli!

1730
03:43:25,500 --> 03:43:29,100
Now come the days of the king.

1731
03:43:34,300 --> 03:43:36,500
May they be blessed.

1732
03:43:56,900 --> 03:43:59,400
This day does not belong to one man...

1733
03:43:59,700 --> 03:44:01,500
...but to all.

1734
03:44:03,300 --> 03:44:06,100
Let us together rebuild this world...

1735
03:44:06,400 --> 03:44:10,400
...that we may share
in the days of peace.

1736
03:44:22,858 --> 03:44:26,858
Out of the Great Sea...

1737
03:44:27,259 --> 03:44:34,309
...to Middle-Earth I am come.

1738
03:44:36,113 --> 03:44:39,813
In this place will I abide...

1739
03:44:40,772 --> 03:44:46,472
...and my heirs...

1740
03:44:47,503 --> 03:44:56,203
...unto the ending of the world.

1741
03:45:05,367 --> 03:45:06,699
Thank you.

1742
03:46:45,100 --> 03:46:47,100
My friends...

1743
03:46:52,500 --> 03:46:55,000
...you bow to no one.

1744
03:47:39,300 --> 03:47:41,300
And thus it was.

1745
03:47:41,600 --> 03:47:45,100
A Fourth Age of Middle-earth began.

1746
03:47:45,400 --> 03:47:47,900
And the Fellowship of the Ring...

1747
03:47:48,100 --> 03:47:52,400
...though eternally bound
by friendship and love...

1748
03:47:52,800 --> 03:47:55,100
...was ended.

1749
03:48:00,200 --> 03:48:04,800
Thirteen months to the day since Gandalf
sent us on our long journey...

1750
03:48:05,200 --> 03:48:09,200
...we found ourselves
looking upon a familiar sight.

1751
03:48:12,000 --> 03:48:14,600
We were home.

1752
03:48:21,200 --> 03:48:22,900
Hi.

1753
03:48:40,200 --> 03:48:42,300
Hey, watch the pumpkin.

1754
03:49:30,600 --> 03:49:32,100
More of the same, Rosie.

1755
03:49:32,300 --> 03:49:34,200
Good night, lads.

1756
03:50:31,900 --> 03:50:35,700
How do you pick up the threads
of an old life?

1757
03:50:37,200 --> 03:50:39,300
How do you go on...

1758
03:50:39,600 --> 03:50:44,600
...when in your heart
you begin to understand...

1759
03:50:46,100 --> 03:50:48,900
...there is no going back?

1760
03:50:49,700 --> 03:50:53,200
There are some things
that time cannot mend...

1761
03:50:53,900 --> 03:50:56,700
...some hurts that go too deep...

1762
03:50:58,600 --> 03:51:01,300
...that have taken hold.

1763
03:51:22,000 --> 03:51:24,900
there and back again...
a hobbit's tale, by Bilbo Baggins

1764
03:51:39,600 --> 03:51:41,400
Mr. Frodo?

1765
03:51:44,800 --> 03:51:46,100
What is it?

1766
03:51:48,000 --> 03:51:51,800
It's been four years to the day
since Weathertop, Sam.

1767
03:51:52,600 --> 03:51:55,200
It's never really healed.

1768
03:51:59,300 --> 03:52:04,300
"There and Back Again: A Hobbit's Tale
by Bilbo Baggins.

1769
03:52:05,300 --> 03:52:08,900
And The Lord of the Rings
by Frodo Baggins."

1770
03:52:09,600 --> 03:52:11,700
You finished it.

1771
03:52:14,600 --> 03:52:16,100
Not quite.

1772
03:52:17,000 --> 03:52:19,400
There's room for a little more.

1773
03:52:22,100 --> 03:52:26,200
Bilbo once told me his part
in this tale would end...

1774
03:52:26,500 --> 03:52:29,700
...that each of us must come and go
in the telling.

1775
03:52:30,600 --> 03:52:33,300
Bilbo's story was now over.

1776
03:52:34,000 --> 03:52:36,800
There would be no more journeys
for him...

1777
03:52:37,100 --> 03:52:38,600
...save one.

1778
03:52:39,400 --> 03:52:42,800
Tell me again, lad,
where are we going?

1779
03:52:43,200 --> 03:52:45,100
To the harbour, Bilbo.

1780
03:52:45,300 --> 03:52:47,900
The Elves have accorded you
a special honour...

1781
03:52:48,200 --> 03:52:50,700
...a place on the last ship
to leave Middle-earth.

1782
03:52:52,500 --> 03:52:54,100
Frodo...

1783
03:52:55,700 --> 03:53:00,000
...any chance of seeing
that old Ring of mine again?

1784
03:53:00,800 --> 03:53:03,000
The one I gave you.

1785
03:53:06,700 --> 03:53:08,700
I'm sorry, Uncle.

1786
03:53:11,400 --> 03:53:13,900
I'm afraid I lost it.

1787
03:53:14,200 --> 03:53:15,900
Oh.

1788
03:53:16,600 --> 03:53:18,000
Pity.

1789
03:53:20,800 --> 03:53:24,500
I should like to have held it
one last time.

1790
03:53:53,800 --> 03:53:58,600
Well, here's a sight
I have never seen before.

1791
03:54:13,000 --> 03:54:16,200
The power of the Three Rings is ended.

1792
03:54:17,200 --> 03:54:19,900
The time has come...

1793
03:54:20,100 --> 03:54:23,300
...for the dominion of Men.

1794
03:54:23,800 --> 03:54:26,520
The sea calls us home.

1795
03:54:35,900 --> 03:54:37,900
I think I'm...

1796
03:54:38,200 --> 03:54:42,400
...quite ready
for another adventure.

1797
03:55:13,600 --> 03:55:15,800
Farewell...

1798
03:55:16,100 --> 03:55:18,700
...my brave Hobbits.

1799
03:55:20,800 --> 03:55:22,700
My work is now finished.

1800
03:55:26,700 --> 03:55:31,300
Here at last,
on the shores of the sea...

1801
03:55:32,300 --> 03:55:35,000
...comes the end of our Fellowship.

1802
03:55:38,600 --> 03:55:41,000
I will not say, "Do not weep"...

1803
03:55:41,900 --> 03:55:45,700
...for not all tears are an evil.

1804
03:56:03,300 --> 03:56:05,200
It is time, Frodo.

1805
03:56:10,800 --> 03:56:12,700
What does he mean?

1806
03:56:15,300 --> 03:56:18,000
We set out to save the Shire, Sam.

1807
03:56:19,800 --> 03:56:22,400
And it has been saved.

1808
03:56:26,200 --> 03:56:28,800
But not for me.

1809
03:56:29,800 --> 03:56:32,100
You don't mean that.

1810
03:56:33,500 --> 03:56:35,500
You can't leave.

1811
03:56:44,000 --> 03:56:46,600
The last pages are for you, Sam.

1812
04:00:19,800 --> 04:00:22,500
My dear Sam:

1813
04:00:24,600 --> 04:00:27,700
You cannot always be torn in two.

1814
04:00:28,100 --> 04:00:32,100
You will have to be one and whole
for many years.

1815
04:00:33,000 --> 04:00:38,200
You have so much to enjoy
and to be and to do.

1816
04:00:39,600 --> 04:00:42,700
Your part in the story will go on.

1817
04:00:43,600 --> 04:00:45,300
Well...

1818
04:00:47,300 --> 04:00:48,900
... I'm back.

1819
04:02:31,500 --> 04:02:35,300
Lay down

1820
04:02:37,100 --> 04:02:41,300
Your sweet and weary head

1821
04:02:43,300 --> 04:02:46,700
Night is falling

1822
04:02:47,500 --> 04:02:52,200
You have come
To journey's end

1823
04:02:53,000 --> 04:02:56,600
Sleep now

1824
04:02:57,000 --> 04:03:02,400
And dream
Of the ones who came before

1825
04:03:04,400 --> 04:03:08,100
They are calling

1826
04:03:08,400 --> 04:03:12,400
From across
The distant shore

1827
04:03:14,200 --> 04:03:18,900
Why do you weep?

1828
04:03:19,300 --> 04:03:24,100
What are these tears
Upon your face?

1829
04:03:24,400 --> 04:03:29,300
Soon you will see

1830
04:03:29,600 --> 04:03:34,400
All ofyour fears
Will pass away

1831
04:03:34,800 --> 04:03:39,600
Safe in my arms

1832
04:03:40,000 --> 04:03:44,300
You're only sleeping

1833
04:03:44,700 --> 04:03:49,500
What can you see

1834
04:03:49,800 --> 04:03:54,900
On the horizon?

1835
04:03:55,200 --> 04:03:59,500
Why do the white gulls

1836
04:03:59,900 --> 04:04:04,400
Call?

1837
04:04:05,900 --> 04:04:10,300
Across the sea

1838
04:04:10,700 --> 04:04:15,700
A pale moon rises

1839
04:04:16,100 --> 04:04:18,600
The ships have come

1840
04:04:18,900 --> 04:04:24,500
To carry you home

1841
04:04:26,900 --> 04:04:31,300
And all will turn

1842
04:04:31,700 --> 04:04:36,800
To silver glass

1843
04:04:37,200 --> 04:04:41,300
A light on the water

1844
04:04:41,600 --> 04:04:46,800
All souls pass

1845
04:04:47,300 --> 04:04:51,300
Hope fades

1846
04:04:53,000 --> 04:04:57,700
Into the world of night

1847
04:04:58,600 --> 04:05:02,300
Through shadows falling

1848
04:05:03,300 --> 04:05:08,200
Out of memory and time

1849
04:05:09,200 --> 04:05:12,800
Don't say

1850
04:05:13,600 --> 04:05:18,400
We have come now to the end

1851
04:05:19,500 --> 04:05:23,800
White shores are calling

1852
04:05:24,100 --> 04:05:27,500
You and I will meet again

1853
04:05:27,800 --> 04:05:34,000
And you'll be here
In my arms

1854
04:05:35,500 --> 04:05:39,400
Just sleeping

1855
04:05:39,700 --> 04:05:44,400
What can you see

1856
04:05:44,700 --> 04:05:49,500
On the horizon?

1857
04:05:49,900 --> 04:05:54,400
Why do the white gulls

1858
04:05:54,800 --> 04:06:00,000
Call?

1859
04:06:00,500 --> 04:06:05,300
Across the sea

1860
04:06:05,700 --> 04:06:10,500
A pale moon rises

1861
04:06:10,900 --> 04:06:13,500
The ships have come

1862
04:06:13,800 --> 04:06:19,900
To carry you home

1863
04:06:21,400 --> 04:06:26,300
And all will turn

1864
04:06:27,000 --> 04:06:31,700
To silver glass

1865
04:06:32,100 --> 04:06:36,100
A light on the water

1866
04:06:36,400 --> 04:06:40,100
Grey ships pass

1867
04:06:40,400 --> 04:06:45,900
Into the West

1869
04:06:46,000 --> 04:06:49,050
