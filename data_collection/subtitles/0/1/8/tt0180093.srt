You know what that means?
No more hacks,

We get off hard knocks
and be on easy street,

154
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,750
What's the catch?

155
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,750
That's red.

have told me that before...

175
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,630
...and it was meaningless.

176
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,640
Why?

177
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:17,630
Because you thought they
were pulling your leg?

178
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:20,630
No, no nothing like that.

179
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,630
l don't know.

180
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:25,630
l don't know or even
care if they were.

181
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,630
lt just...

182
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:31,630
...it was meaningless.

183
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,630
You know?

184
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,630
When you say it...

185
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,630
...l hear it.

186
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,630
l really hear it.

187
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:51,630
Somebody like you could really
make things alright for me.

188
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,630
You think?

189
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,580
What is it?

190
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,580
Remember when l told
you about the store?

191
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,580
Yeah.

192
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:06,580
l've been thinking
about it a lot.

193
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:09,580
l put together some
numbers and it's...

194
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,580
...it's not impossible.

195
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,580
l mean...

196
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:17,580
...you know, you could do.
You should do it.

197
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,580
l mean we could
do it together.

198
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,580
What do you think?

199
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,500
Stop already.

200
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:40,500
l felt better in a red
dress than a cheese danish.

201
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,500
Three things is aII I
did to change my Iife:

202
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,500
Three things,

203
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,500
No red meat,

204
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,500
Think about it, What do
they stick in red meat?

205
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,500
I ate red meat,,,

206
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,500
,,, to the point where I wouId
eat it sIab right off, raw,

207
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:32,500
I turned it around,

208
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:35,500
You need to be passionate,
No red meat,

209
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:38,510
No red meat for 30 days,

210
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,510
No red meat!

211
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,500
Ada told us. lt's gorgeous.

212
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,420
We're going to make it
a little darker tomorrow.

213
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,420
Why darker?

214
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,420
To go with my red dress.

215
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,920
Yeah, but now it's
looking like Madonna.

216
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,420
This is not Madonna.

217
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,420
And neither is this. But
soon... l'm going on a diet.

218
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,420
-What diet are you on?
-Eggs and grapefruit.

219
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,920
l was on that once.
Lots of luck.

220
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,420
lt's not so bad.

221
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,420
-How long you been on it?
-All day.

222
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,420
All day? lt's one o'clock.

223
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,420
-l'm thinking thin.
-She's thinking thin.

224
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,420
My Louise, she lost fifty
pounds just like that.

225
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,420
-Like that?
-Like what?

226
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,420
What did you do, put
her in a sweat box?

227
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,420
She went to a doctor.
He gave her pills.

228
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,420
-You don't want to eat.
-What's so good about that?

229
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:42,420
l'm sitting here not thinking
about pastrami on rye?

230
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,420
You really shouldn't talk like
that when someone's on a diet.

231
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,420
Oh, big deal.

232
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,420
l'll sneak another
wedge of grapefruit.

233
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,420
l'm thinking thin.

234
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,420
Oh Sara, the mailman...

235
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,420
Sara Goldfarb?

236
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,420
You have something
for Sara Goldfarb?

237
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,380
-l'm expecting something.
-Mrs. Goldfarb...

238
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,380
...Goldfarb...

239
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,380
-Sara Goldfarb.
-This is it?

240
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,380
That's it. Come on.

241
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:11,380
Alright, okay. Okay. Your

242
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,380

G-O-L-D...

244
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,380
...F-A-R-B!

245
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,380
Dynamite?

246
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,380
Dynamite.

247
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,380
Dynamite!

248
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,380
Alright we on our way.
Alright.

249
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,390
Brody's man says he got
some real fine shit, man.

250
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:32,390
Alright man.

251
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:35,390
Here we go.

252
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,390
Alright...

253
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,390
...let's do this right, man.

254
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,390
Come on baby...

255
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,380
...naturally.

256
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,380
Come on, hurry.

257
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,380
Maybe they'll send you
to the Tavern on the Green.

258
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,380
You know, that's where
they send all the stars.

259
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,290
l'm eating eggs and grapefruit
at Tavern on the Green.

260
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,290
Hurry before the
mailman comes.

261
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,290
Here we are.

262
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:07,290
Mail it!

263
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,260
There it is, jim.

264
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,260
There it is, baby.

265
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,220
Shit.

266
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,260
Shall we try?

267
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,260
Wait, Ty.

268
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,250
Look.

269
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:40,250
This is our chance
to make it big.

270
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,250
We play it right...

271
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:45,250
...an' we can get
a pound of pure...

272
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,250
...but if we get wasted...

273
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:49,250
...we'll fuck it up.

274
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:51,250
l know.

275
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,250
l ain't trying
to jive you, jim.

276
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:57,250
l don't want to be running
the streets my whole life...

277
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:00,170
...my sneakers all ripped up, my
nose runnin' down to my chin.

278
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:03,170
All l'm saying is we should
take a little taste...

279
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,170
...so we know
how much to cut.

280
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,170
lt's business.

281
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,170
Fair enough.

282
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:19,170
Sheeit...

283
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:39,170
Thank you, Three things is
aII I did to change my Iife,

284
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,170
Thirty days is aII
it takes, Three things,,,

285
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,170
Number two:

286
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,170
No refined sugar!

287
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,170
Now sugar's everywhere,

288
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:50,170
You know, they even put
sugar in bottIed water?

289
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:53,170
I was sick with sugar,
That was my medicine,

290
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:56,170
It nurtured my spiraIIing
brain that feIt I was a Ioser,

291
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,170
-Juice by you!
-Juice by you!

292
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:09,080
Sucking candies,
very good sir,

293
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,080
None of that stuff,
Just stay away from it,

294
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:14,080
No refined sugar,
Watch it for 30 days,,,

295
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,080
I'm going to eat right,,,

296
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,090

pick up my spirits,,,

297
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:22,090
,,, and I am going to try,,,

298
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,080
Stop!

299
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,040
-HeIIo?
-Rosie?

300
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,040
-Yeah?
-Sara,

301
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,040
l need the number
of that doctor.

302
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,040
l don't understand
why you got to see him.

303
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,040
Cut the son of a bitch
loose for Christ's sake.

304
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,040
Because l don't want him
mentioning to my parents...

305
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,040
...that l've stopped therapy.

306
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,040
They're already
so pissed off at me...

307
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,040
...they're thinking
of cutting me off.

308
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,040
Harry, l'm not going to
sleep with him or anything.

309
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,040
l'm going to come home
after the concert.

310
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,040
You're jealous!

311
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,040
Harry jealous?

312
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,040
Put your arms around me.

313
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,040
Oh you are so stubborn...

314
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,040
...put your arms around me.

315
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,040
Stop that!

316
00:27:58,090 --> 00:27:59,960
l'll suck your eyeballs out.

317
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,960
Well...

318
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:06,960
l'm disappointed that
you're indisposed.

319
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:10,970
ls Anita out of town,
or something?

320
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:13,970
Why do you ask?

321
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,970
l was just wondering
if she's...

322
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,970
...''indisposed''.

323
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,970
No.

324
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,960
She's fine, thank you.

325
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,960
Actually she's in Florida.

326
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,960
Can l ask you something
personal Arnold?

327
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,960
Of course.

Anything. What?

329
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,960
You have something

330
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,960
-There?
-A little bit... lower.

331
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,960
lt's okay. Don't
worry about it.

332
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,960
lt's much better. Arnold...

333
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,960
How are you, Mrs. Goldfarb?

334
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,960
How am l? Enormous.

335
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,880
-That's why l'm here.
-Oh, l've seen much worse.

336
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,920
Thank you.

337
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,920

339
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,920
The doctor will be
with you shortly.

340
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,920
-You're a little overweight.
-A little?

341
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,920
l have fifty pounds
l'm willing to donate.

342
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,920
We can take care of that...

343
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,920
...no problem.

344
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,920
We're on our way, baby...

345
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,920
...we're really on our way.

346
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,920
God, it was great out there.

347
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,920

00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,830

00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,830
...blue in the afternoon...

356
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,830
...orange in the evening.

357
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,830
That's my three meals,
Mr. Smarty Pants.

358
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,830
And green at night.

359
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,830
Just like that.
One, two, three, four...

360
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,750
Why dontcha' come

361
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,750
Come on now, Alice.

362
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,750
Got plenty of time for that.

363
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:49,750
Right now l'm grooving with
these new mirrors l got.

364
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,710
l told ya, ma.

365
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,710
One day l'd make it.

366
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,710
You don't have to
make anything, my sweet.

367
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,710
You just have to
love your momma.

368
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,710
What are you doing baby?

369
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,710
What are you doing baby?

370
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,710
Nothing.

371
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,720
l was thinking about you...

372
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,720
...and the nasty things
l'm about to do to ya.

373
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,720
l'm going to get on you.

374
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,720
You'll scare me to death.

375
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,720
Oh no, l wouldn't scare you.

376
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,720
l don't want to scare nobody.

377
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:54,670
All l want is a little bit
of peace and happiness.

378
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,710
Right now....

379
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:01,630
...you're the finest fox
l ever laid my eyes on.

380
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,630
That's what l'll do.

381
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,630
For my mother.

382
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:12,630
l've been thinking about
getting something for her.

383
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:13,630
Like...

384
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,630
...like a present or something.

385
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,630
But l didn't know
what l was going to get.

386
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,630
-Until now.
-And?

387
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,630
l finally asked myself, right...

388
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,630
...what's her fix?

389
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,630
Television, right?

390
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:29,630
l mean if ever there's a TV
junkie it's the old lady.

391
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:32,630
lf l figure l owe her
a new set anyway...

392
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:35,630
...with all the wear
and tear it got.

393
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,630
You really love
her, don't you?

394
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,630
l don't know.
l guess so, y'know.

395
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,630
Most of the time l just
want her to be happy.

396
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,630
Let's go get it.

397
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,630
Well let's push-off first.

The red dress.

No one to visit her...

483

The one your father

l remember how he looked
at me in the red dress.

519
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:38,180

00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,090
l don't know when yet...

527
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:04,090
But you'll see how proud you
are when you see your mother...

528
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:08,090
...in her red dress on
television, in golden shoes...

529
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:10,090
What is the big deal
about being on television?

530
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:13,080
Those pills will kill you
before you ever get on.

531
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:15,080
Big deal?

532
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:17,080
You drove up in a cab.

533
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:20,080
Did you see who had
the best seat?

534
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:22,080
l'm somebody now, Harry.

535
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:25,080
Everybody likes me.

536
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:26,080
Soon...

537
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:29,080
...millions of people
will see me...

538
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:31,080
...and they'll all like me.

539
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:33,080
l'll tell them about you...

540
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:35,080
...and your father.

541
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:38,080
How good he was to us.

542
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:40,080
Remember?

543
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:46,080
lt's a reason to get
up in the morning.

544
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:49,080
lt's a reason to lose weight...

545
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:52,080
...to fit in the red dress.

546
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,080
lt's a reason to smile.

547
00:43:57,130 --> 00:44:00,040
lt makes tomorrow alright.

548
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,040
What have l got, Harry?

549
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,040
Why should l even...

550
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,040
...make the bed or
wash the dishes?

551
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,040
l do them.

552
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:16,040
But why should l?

553
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,040
l'm alone.

554
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,040
Your father's gone.

555
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,040
You're gone.

556
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,040
l got no one....

557
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:29,040
...to care for.

558
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:32,050
What have l got, Harry?

559
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:39,050
l'm lonely.

560
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:43,050
l'm old.

561
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:46,050
You got friends, ma.

562
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:49,050
lt's not the same.

563
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:51,050
They don't need me.

564
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,970
l like the way l feel.

565
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,960
l like thinking about the red
dress and the television...

566
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,960
...and you and your father.

567
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,960
Now when l get
the sun l smile.

568
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,960
l'll come and visit, ma.

569
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,960
Now that l'm straight, my
business is going good...

570
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,960
...l'll come. Me and Marion.
We'll come for dinner.

571
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,960
That's good, you bring her.

572
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,960
l'll make your mushroom
soup and a roast.

573
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,960
That sounds great, ma.

574
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,960
That sounds great.

575
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,960

Thanks, man.

587
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,830
He says you're smart,
you're loyal...

588
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,830
...and you're not a junkie.

589
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,830
Brody wants to promote you.

590
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,830
He wants to give you more
responsibility. You interested?

591

-...l'll kill you.

595
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:23,830
Remember that.

596
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,830
Oh shit, you got
a white driver.

597
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,830
FALL

598
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,830

599
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,830

600
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,760
l love you, Harry.

601
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,760
You make me feel

You are beautiful.

606
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:55,750
You're the most beautiful
girl in the world.

607
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:59,710
You're my dream.

608
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:07,710
No, Mrs, GoIdfarb,

609
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:09,710
I'm absoIuteIy certain,

610
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:12,710
But maybe you gave me
a weaker one last time.

611
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,710
That isn't possibIe,
Mrs, GoIdfarb,

612
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:16,710
They're aII the same potency,

613
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:18,710
But something isn't the same.

614
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:20,710
You're just becoming
adjusted to them,

615
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:23,710
It's nothing to worry about
Mrs, GoIdfarb, okay,

616

They got most of our cash.

You're up for consortin'.

629
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,720
Oh shit, man.

630
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:29,710
Angel says it's a war between
the ltalians and the blacks.

631
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:33,710
Sal the Geep is keeping all
the shit down in Florida.

00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:35,710

633
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:38,710

Yeah. lt was a bad dream.

642
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:39,630
You want some water?

643
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:03,590
Maybe we should dip in now.

644
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,550
Come Marion, l already

645
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:09,590

648
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:22,550
lt's a bitch out there.

lt'll be okay.

650
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:30,580
lt'll be okay, Harry.

651
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:36,580

l love you, Harry.

654
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:29,500
What seems to be the problem?
The weight's doing fine.

655
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:32,500
The weight is fine. l'm not.

656
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:35,500
The refrigerator...

657
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:38,510
Something wrong?

658
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:43,510
Everything's....

659
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:49,510
...all mixed up.

660
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:51,510
-Confused like...
-That's nothing to worry about.

661
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:53,510
Just get this filled.

662
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:55,510
Make an appointment

663
00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:06,430
Well?

664
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:09,430
Tyrone ain't
found nothing yet.

665
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:13,430
What are we going to do?

666
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,430
l don't know.

667
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,430
Well you have to
do something here.

668
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:20,420
lt's your fault that we don't
have something for the morning.

669
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,420
What are you talking about?

670
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,420
You were all hot in the
biscuit to get off last night.

671
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:27,420
-That is such bullshit!
-You didn't have to, okay.

672
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,420
-We could have something now.
-What was l supposed to do?

673
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:32,420
To sit around and watch you
push-off and not go myself?

674
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,420
Just don't put it
all on me, okay.

675
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:47,420
Don't worry, man.

676
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,420
We'll fill it up again.

677
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,420
Y'know, things'll get better.

678
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:55,420
Then we'll be filling
the box back up, y'know.

679
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:05,380
So you want to
hear the news?

680
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:07,380
What news?

681
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:10,380
You got your good news
and the bad news.

682
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:13,380
Shoot.

683
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:15,380
The good news is in
a couple of days...

684
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:18,380
...there's going to be some
prime back on the street.

685
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:20,380
Really!

686
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:25,380
-Who told you that?
-Angel.

687
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:26,380
Yeah?

688
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:29,390
Yeah, Sal the Geep let

689
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:31,390
...for the Christmas season.

690
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:33,390
Him being a good Christian...

691
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:36,390
...he wants no wanting during
this glorious season.

692
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:39,390
-You believe it?
-Well l did.

693
00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:41,390
Until l heard the bad news.

694
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:48,390
Yeah...

695
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:51,390
The price is doubled...

696
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:54,390
...and you'll have to cop for
weight at least half a piece.

697
00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:55,390
How much?

698
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:58,300
-Two.
-Two?

699
00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:00,300
That's fuckin' insane!

700
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:02,300
What the fuck you gonna do?

701
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:04,300
The man ain't goin' to lay
no nickel bag on you.

702
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:06,180
Where we gonna get two?

703
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:08,300
You mean Arnold?

704
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:12,290
Well, your parents won't
even return your call.

705
00:56:13,330 --> 00:56:16,290
l haven't seen him in months.

706
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:18,290
So what? He's still
calling, ain't he?

707
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:19,290
l don't know.

708
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:23,290
Look, l don't know
what else to do.

709
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:27,290
Okay, this is our last chance
to get back on track.

710
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:30,290
We won't have to make that
freezing scene every day.

711
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:34,290
We need the bread.

712
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:38,290
Getting the money is
not the problem, Harry.

713
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:41,290
Then what is the problem
for Christs sake?

714
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:44,290
l don't know what l'm going
to have to do to get it.

715
00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:51,290
Look...

716
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:53,290
...baby...

717
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:58,210
We'll be back in
business in no time.

718
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:00,210
We'll start moving again...

719
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:04,210
...and we'll start saving.

720
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:10,210
lt'll be perfect. Just like
it was. l promise, Marion.

721
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:15,210
You'll see.

722
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:26,220
No, l've just...

723
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:29,220
...l had the flu forever
it seems like.

724
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:33,220
Are you depressed?

725
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:35,220
No, it's nothing like
that. l've been...

726
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:38,220
...l've been really busy.

727
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:41,220
Actually l've been
designing non stop.

728
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:42,220
That's wonderful.

729
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:44,220
l'm glad to hear
you've been productive.

730
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:51,220
To be perfectly frank...

731
00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:54,220
...l was a little surprised
to hear from you.

732
00:57:57,220 --> 00:58:00,180
-ls something wrong?
-No.

733
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:03,170
-Why?
-Well...

734
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:05,170
...that's usually the case
when you get a call...

735
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:07,170
...from someone you haven't
heard from for a while.

736
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:09,170
Everything's fine.

737
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:15,170
Actually...

738
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:21,170
...l have a favor to ask.

739
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:30,170
You smug fuck!

740
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:32,170
What is it?

741
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:39,170
l need to borrow
some money.

742
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:41,170
May l ask what for?

743
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:45,170
Could you turn the light off?

744
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:47,170
What do you want
the light off for?

745
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:49,170

746
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:53,170
-You never did before.
-Please, Arnold.

747
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,960
Where is everybody?

01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:24,960
l don't know, man.

749
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,960
All they said was meet
at Waldbaum's.

750
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,960
Are you sure this is
the right Waldbaum's?

751
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,960
Yeah man, l'm positive,
alright.

752
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,960
Look, you just watch my back,
and l'll watch yours, alright?

753
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:45,960
What the fuck are we
supposed to do now?

01:02:58,930 --> 01:03:00,890

889
01:15:00,210 --> 01:15:02,170

890
01:15:02,210 --> 01:15:04,170
Maybe you lost my card.

891
01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:08,170
Please dolly, you'll have
a look and you'll tell me.

892
01:15:08,210 --> 01:15:10,170
lt's not the prizes.

01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:13,170
l'll give them away.

894
01:15:13,210 --> 01:15:16,170
l just want to be
on the show.

895
01:15:16,210 --> 01:15:18,170
l've waited so long to be...

896
01:15:18,210 --> 01:15:20,170
...on with my Harry...

897
01:15:20,210 --> 01:15:22,170
...and grandson.

898
01:15:23,210 --> 01:15:26,170
Here, Mrs. Goldfarb, sip this.

899
01:15:26,210 --> 01:15:29,170
Sometimes it takes awhile
to get called for a show...

900
01:15:29,210 --> 01:15:30,170
...Mrs. Goldfarb.

901
01:15:35,220 --> 01:15:37,170
-This her?
-Yes.

902
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:39,180
Can you walk?

903
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:41,180
l'm walking across this stage.

904
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:45,180
And you should see
my Harry on television.

905
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:47,180
We're giving the prizes away.

906

907
01:15:54,220 --> 01:15:57,090
-What's her name?
-We think it's Sara Goldfarb.

908
01:15:57,180 --> 01:16:01,090
Call Seymore and tell him to
meet me at the beauty parlor.

909
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:04,090
l've got the dress that l
wore to Harry's graduation...

910
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:06,090
...and the gold shoes.

911
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:08,090
Okay Mrs. Goldfarb.
Here we go.

912
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:10,090
One... two... three...

913
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:13,090
Let's take it nice and easy.

914
01:16:37,130 --> 01:16:38,080

915
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:03,040

918
01:17:42,050 --> 01:17:44,050
Oh, sheeit.

919
01:17:44,090 --> 01:17:47,050
God damned jim,
how long you had that?

920
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:49,050
A few days.

921
01:17:50,050 --> 01:17:52,050
That shit don't
look too good.

922
01:17:52,090 --> 01:17:54,050
lt don't feel too
good either, man.

923
01:17:57,010 --> 01:17:58,970
But a little stuff will
take care of that.

924
01:17:59,050 --> 01:18:00,970
Hey, what's wrong with you.
Don't shoot in there.

925
01:18:01,050 --> 01:18:02,970
l'll blow it if l don't.

926
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:04,970
Fuck it!

927
01:18:18,010 --> 01:18:19,970
Oh shit.

928
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,960
Hi, how are you.
Can you hear me?

929
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:37,960
Yes, Seymore.

930
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:41,960
-Did you take anything?
-l took my red dress in.

931
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:43,960
No emergency.
Take her to psych.

932
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,880
Come on in.

933
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:08,880
What's your name?

934
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:12,880
Marion.

935
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,880
Well what do you know.

936
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:16,880
Maid Marion.

937
01:19:22,930 --> 01:19:24,890
l'm Little John.

938
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:29,890
You have a beautiful view...

939
01:19:33,930 --> 01:19:35,890
What l like best about patty
chicks is they give good head.

940
01:19:36,930 --> 01:19:38,890
Black broads don't know
nothing about no head.

941
01:19:38,970 --> 01:19:40,890
l don't know why.

942
01:19:40,970 --> 01:19:43,890
Maybe it has something
to do with some ancient...

943
01:19:43,970 --> 01:19:44,890
...tribal custom.

944
01:20:05,930 --> 01:20:07,890
Better save some
of that energy.

945
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:26,880
l know it's purty baby...

946
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:29,880
...but l didn't take
it out for air.

947
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:49,880
l told you to stay
away from that arm.

948
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,880
l gotta call Marion, man.

949
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:56,830
Well it's about to be a
long distance call now.

950
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:58,830
That's six hundred miles.

951
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:01,830
Man, we are six hundred
miles closer to Miami.

952
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:04,830
Yeah. We're also six hundred
miles further away...

953
01:21:04,890 --> 01:21:05,830
...from New York, Ty.

954
01:21:11,890 --> 01:21:13,840
You know, l know where
you could pick up...

955
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:14,840
...a real nice taste.

956
01:21:14,890 --> 01:21:18,840
Sunday night we're throwing
a little gathering.

957
01:21:18,890 --> 01:21:19,840
All good people.

958
01:21:19,890 --> 01:21:22,840
l can't. l'm busy.

959
01:21:22,890 --> 01:21:24,840
Anyway, l'm not
really hooked.

960
01:21:24,890 --> 01:21:28,840
Yeah, l know. But l'm tellin'
ya', it's a real nice taste.

961
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:36,840
l'll see you Sunday,
Maid Marion.

962
01:21:37,890 --> 01:21:40,840
Okay Mrs. Goldfarb. Just try
and answer my questions, okay.

963
01:21:40,890 --> 01:21:43,840
When did you start
taking the pills?

964
01:21:44,890 --> 01:21:45,840
The summer.

965
01:21:45,890 --> 01:21:47,840
You started in the summer.
Last summer?

966
01:21:47,890 --> 01:21:49,840
l got the best
place in the sun.

967
01:21:49,890 --> 01:21:52,840
-Okay.
-Ada fixed my hair.

968
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,840
Everything's going to be
alright, Mrs. Goldfarb.

969
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,760
We'll get you all
fixed up in no time.

970
01:22:17,790 --> 01:22:19,750
You're okay. You're okay.

971
01:22:19,830 --> 01:22:23,750
l can't cut it, man. l gotta
do something about this arm.

972
01:22:23,830 --> 01:22:25,750
Let's see what it looks like.

973
01:22:31,790 --> 01:22:34,750
Oh man.

974
01:22:36,790 --> 01:22:39,750
That's the ugliest mothafucka'
l've ever seen.

975
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:41,750
l gotta call Marion.

976
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:42,750
Fuck that.

977
01:22:42,830 --> 01:22:45,750
We got to get you
to a hospital, man.

978
01:22:49,790 --> 01:22:51,750
What is that?

979
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,710
What is that?

980
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:36,720
What's the problem?

981
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:37,720
My arm.

982
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:40,720
-My arm, it's killing me.
-Let's have a look at it.

983
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:46,720
Alright.

984
01:23:49,710 --> 01:23:51,710
l'll be back in a minute.

985
01:24:18,670 --> 01:24:21,630
l want to just play black
jack all night long.

986
01:24:21,710 --> 01:24:26,630
l tell them ''Hey, you guys go
ahead, l don't feel good.

987
01:24:26,710 --> 01:24:28,630
Sure enough,
they leave the room...

988
01:24:28,710 --> 01:24:30,630
Ready? One... two... three...

989
01:24:32,670 --> 01:24:34,630
And then as soon
as they leave...

990
01:24:34,710 --> 01:24:36,630
...l go running back
down to the casino...

991
01:24:36,710 --> 01:24:38,630
Sit at my blackjack table.

992
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:40,630
Man, l am there for
the whole night.

993
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:44,630
Finally l get up so big
l got five hundred dollar...

994
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:47,640
...black chips in my pocket.

995
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:51,640
l swear to God, the hours
are going by, l'm laying bets.

996
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:55,550
He's a security guard...

997
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:59,550
...and he's telling me
l have to leave.

998
01:25:01,590 --> 01:25:03,550
l'm like ''why are you
telling me l have to leave?''

999
01:25:11,590 --> 01:25:12,550
S-w-a-l-l-o-w!

1000
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:50,540
You have to eat,
Mrs. Goldfarb.

1001
01:25:50,630 --> 01:25:52,540
lf we're going to get you
healthy, you have to eat.

1002
01:25:53,580 --> 01:25:55,500
Try and work with
the attendants.

1003
01:25:55,540 --> 01:25:57,500
l'm going to try
some new medications.

1004
01:26:59,470 --> 01:27:01,430
Hello?

1005
01:27:01,510 --> 01:27:03,430

Mrs. Goldfarb, we've tried
several medications...

1029
01:28:36,430 --> 01:28:39,390
...and you don't seem
to be responding.

1030
01:28:39,430 --> 01:28:41,390
l believe we might be at
a point where we might...

1031
01:28:41,430 --> 01:28:43,390
...want to try some
alternative methods.

1032
01:28:43,430 --> 01:28:47,390
We've had excellent results
with ECTin the past.

1033
01:28:47,430 --> 01:28:50,390
So if l can just get...

1034
