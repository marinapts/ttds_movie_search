00:00:54,419 --> 00:00:58,122
<i>This is a story about a man</i>
<i>named Harold Crick.</i>

2
00:00:58,122 --> 00:01:00,352
<i>And his wristwatch.</i>

3
00:01:00,925 --> 00:01:03,828
<i>Harold Crick was a man of infinite</i>
<i>numbers…</i>

4
00:01:03,828 --> 00:01:07,699
<i>…endless calculations</i>
<i>and remarkably few words.</i>

5
00:01:07,699 --> 00:01:10,566
<i>And his wristwatch said even less.</i>

6
00:01:12,303 --> 00:01:15,136
<i>Every weekday, for 12 years…</i>

7
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:20,778
<i>…Harold would brush</i>
<i>each of his 32 teeth 76 times.</i>

8
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,086
<i>Thirty-eight times back and forth.</i>

9
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,958
<i>Thirty-eight times up and down.</i>

10
00:01:29,254 --> 00:01:31,848
<i>Every weekday, for 12 years…</i>

11
00:01:32,056 --> 00:01:36,327
<i>…Harold would tie his tie in a single</i>
<i>Windsor knot instead of the double…</i>

12
00:01:36,327 --> 00:01:39,353
<i>…thereby saving up to 43 seconds.</i>

13
00:01:39,564 --> 00:01:44,866
<i>His wristwatch thought the single</i>
<i>Windsor made his neck look fat…</i>

14
00:01:45,069 --> 00:01:46,719
<i>…but said nothing.</i>

15
00:01:50,141 --> 00:01:52,451
<i>Every weekday, for 12 years…</i>

16
00:01:52,577 --> 00:01:57,415
<i>…Harold would run at a rate of nearly</i>
<i>57 steps per block for six blocks…</i>

17
00:01:57,415 --> 00:02:00,979
<i>…barely catching</i>
<i>the 8:17 Kronecker bus.</i>

18
00:02:01,386 --> 00:02:03,221
<i>His wristwatch would delight…</i>

19
00:02:03,221 --> 00:02:07,841
<i>…in the feeling of the crisp wind</i>
<i>rushing over its face.</i>

20
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,936
<i>And every weekday, for 12 years…</i>

21
00:02:17,936 --> 00:02:21,303
<i>…Harold would review 7.134</i>
<i>tax files…</i>

22
00:02:21,506 --> 00:02:25,862
<i>…as a senior agent</i>
<i>for the Internal Revenue Service.</i>

23
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,539
Regs section 1.469-2 (B) (i), Diane.
Thanks.

24
00:02:29,747 --> 00:02:32,113
Good morning. IRS.

25
00:02:33,117 --> 00:02:35,881
Harold, 89 times 1417?

26
00:02:36,621 --> 00:02:38,748
126,113.

27
00:02:38,957 --> 00:02:39,924
That adds up.

28
00:02:40,391 --> 00:02:44,623
<i>Only taking a 45.7-minute</i>
<i>lunch break…</i>

29
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,029
<i>…and a 4.3-minute coffee break…</i>

30
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:52,327
<i>…timed precisely by his wristwatch.</i>

31
00:02:52,804 --> 00:02:53,930
Oh, great.

32
00:02:54,138 --> 00:02:56,514
Yeah, we'll go to Mullen's or we'II…

33
00:02:57,075 --> 00:03:01,171
<i>Beyond that,</i>
<i>Harold lived a life of solitude.</i>

34
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,444
<i>He would walk home alone.</i>

35
00:03:06,351 --> 00:03:08,785
<i>He would eat alone.</i>

36
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,162
<i>And at precisely 11:13 every night…</i>

37
00:03:20,365 --> 00:03:23,129
<i>…Harold would go to bed alone…</i>

38
00:03:23,334 --> 00:03:28,284
<i>…placing his wristwatch to rest</i>
<i>on the nightstand beside him.</i>

39
00:03:29,273 --> 00:03:33,300
<i>That was, of course,</i>
<i>before Wednesday.</i>

40
00:03:34,946 --> 00:03:40,145
O<i>n Wednesday, Harold's wristwatch</i>
<i>changed everything.</i>

41
00:03:46,691 --> 00:03:48,318
Oh, my God, you got it?

42
00:03:48,526 --> 00:03:49,652
I got it.

43
00:03:50,194 --> 00:03:51,559
I got it.

44
00:04:04,275 --> 00:04:06,944
<i>If one had asked Harold,</i>
<i>he would have said…</i>

45
00:04:06,944 --> 00:04:11,949
<i>…that this particular Wednesday was</i>
<i>exactly like all the Wednesdays prior.</i>

46
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:14,523
<i>And he began it the same way he…</i>

47
00:04:24,862 --> 00:04:28,624
<i>And he began it the same way</i>
<i>he always did.</i>

48
00:04:31,335 --> 00:04:32,427
Hello?

49
00:04:42,113 --> 00:04:45,516
<i>He began it the same way</i>
<i>he always did.</i>

50
00:04:45,516 --> 00:04:47,351
<i>When others' minds would…</i>

51
00:04:47,351 --> 00:04:48,935
Hello? Is someone there?

52
00:04:56,027 --> 00:04:59,897
<i>When others' minds would fantasize</i>
<i>about their upcoming day…</i>

53
00:04:59,897 --> 00:05:04,202
<i>…or even try to grip onto</i>
<i>the final moments of their dreams…</i>

54
00:05:04,202 --> 00:05:08,036
<i>…Harold just counted brushstrokes.</i>

55
00:05:09,874 --> 00:05:13,211
All right, who just said,
“Harold just counted brushstrokes”?

56
00:05:13,211 --> 00:05:16,180
And how do you know I'm counting
brushstrokes?

57
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,579
Hello?

58
00:05:20,184 --> 00:05:23,984
<i>It was remarkable how the simple,</i>
<i>modest…</i>

59
00:05:26,557 --> 00:05:28,616
<i>It was remarkable h…</i>

60
00:05:32,563 --> 00:05:37,268
<i>It was remarkable how the simple,</i>
<i>modest elements of Harold's life…</i>

61
00:05:37,268 --> 00:05:39,578
<i>…so often taken for granted…</i>

62
00:05:39,637 --> 00:05:45,041
<i>…would become the catalyst</i>
<i>for an entirely new life.</i>

63
00:05:46,144 --> 00:05:48,012
<i>Harold ran for the bus…</i>

64
00:05:48,012 --> 00:05:51,516
<i>…his stiff leather shoes</i>
<i>making a terrible squeaking sound…</i>

65
00:05:51,516 --> 00:05:54,354
<i>…as they flexed against the asphalt.</i>

66
00:05:59,657 --> 00:06:03,287
<i>And though this was</i>
<i>an extraordinary day…</i>

67
00:06:03,427 --> 00:06:07,465
<i>…a day to be remembered</i>
<i>for the rest of Harold's life…</i>

68
00:06:07,465 --> 00:06:11,029
<i>…Harold just thought</i>
<i>it was a Wednesday.</i>

69
00:06:11,102 --> 00:06:13,016
I'm sorry, did you hear that?

70
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:17,608
The voice. Did you hear it?
“Harold thought it was a Wednesday”?

71
00:06:17,608 --> 00:06:19,522
Don't worry, it is Wednesday.

72
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:24,267
No, no, did you hear it? “Harold
just thought it was a Wednesday”?

73
00:06:24,515 --> 00:06:27,143
–Who's Harold?
–I'm Harold.

74
00:06:27,752 --> 00:06:29,996
Harold, it's okay, it's Wednesday.

75
00:06:30,154 --> 00:06:31,621
No, no, I…

76
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,782
Never mind.

77
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:37,995
<i>Harold couldn't concentrate</i>
<i>on his work.</i>

78
00:06:37,995 --> 00:06:39,163
Excuse me, Harold?

79
00:06:39,163 --> 00:06:42,300
<i>His thoughts were scattered.</i>
<i>His mind elsewhere.</i>

80
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,631
Sorry.

81
00:06:44,035 --> 00:06:46,871
Someone here should be able to fix…
Hold on a second.

82
00:06:46,871 --> 00:06:50,136
Hey, Harold. What's 67 times 453?

83
00:06:50,341 --> 00:06:54,345
<i>When a coworker asked</i>
<i>the product of 67 and 453…</i>

84
00:06:54,345 --> 00:06:56,747
You know what?
I can't think while you're talking.

85
00:06:56,747 --> 00:06:58,331
<i>…he drew a blank.</i>

86
00:06:58,449 --> 00:06:59,416
–What?
–What?

87
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:03,955
<i>–Harold quickly answered, “30,351.”</i>
–What? Oh, nothing. 30,351.

88
00:07:03,955 --> 00:07:07,453
<i>Despite the answer</i>
<i>really being 31,305.</i>

89
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:12,054
Wait, wait, wait, 31,305. Sorry.

90
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:18,231
Dude, I just totally caught
some insurance adjuster…

91
00:07:18,302 --> 00:07:20,964
…claiming his jet ski
as a work vehicle.

92
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,409
I'll tell you, it is a shame…

93
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:28,039
…that they don't give out
an auditor of the year award.

94
00:07:29,648 --> 00:07:30,979
Dude?

95
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:33,316
You okay?

96
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:36,546
Dave, I'm being followed.

97
00:07:41,326 --> 00:07:44,062
How are you being followed?
You're not moving.

98
00:07:44,062 --> 00:07:46,860
–It's by a voice.
–What?

99
00:07:47,065 --> 00:07:49,863
I'm being followed
by a woman's voice.

100
00:07:52,871 --> 00:07:54,338
Okay.

101
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,039
What is she saying?

102
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:00,712
She's narrating.

103
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:08,553
Harold, you're staring at boxes,
what is she narrating?

104
00:08:08,553 --> 00:08:10,851
No, no, no. I had to stop filing.

105
00:08:11,056 --> 00:08:12,970
Watch. Watch. Listen. Listen.

106
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,562
<i>The sound the paper made</i>
<i>against the folder…</i>

107
00:08:17,562 --> 00:08:21,852
<i>…had the same tone</i>
<i>as a wave scraping against sand.</i>

108
00:08:23,101 --> 00:08:24,903
<i>And when Harold thought about it…</i>

109
00:08:24,903 --> 00:08:27,339
<i>…he listened to enough waves</i>
<i>every day…</i>

110
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:32,421
<i>…to constitute what he imagined</i>
<i>to be a deep and endless ocean.</i>

111
00:08:33,545 --> 00:08:34,944
Did you hear that?

112
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:36,546
You mean you filing?

113
00:08:36,748 --> 00:08:38,340
No, no, no, the voice.

114
00:08:39,451 --> 00:08:40,679
No.

115
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,608
Frightening part is sometimes I do
imagine a deep and endless ocean.

116
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:48,856
What ocean?

117
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:52,053
The one made by the sound…
Forget it.

118
00:08:52,264 --> 00:08:54,232
New audits. Have a good day.

119
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:55,730
Thank you.

120
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:03,531
All right, we got a baker
and a securities trader.

121
00:09:07,646 --> 00:09:09,758
Maybe you should take the baker.

122
00:09:10,315 --> 00:09:11,577
–Okay?
–Okay.

123
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:22,416
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

124
00:09:22,627 --> 00:09:25,653
–You miscreant.
–I understand.

125
00:09:26,164 --> 00:09:30,294
Oh, get bent, taxman!

126
00:09:30,502 --> 00:09:32,561
–Taxman!
–Taxman!

127
00:09:33,772 --> 00:09:35,603
Taxman!

128
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:39,276
Go home!

129
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:43,240
Listen, is there somewhere else
we could talk about this?

130
00:09:43,515 --> 00:09:48,145
No. We're gonna talk about this
right here.

131
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:53,981
Okay. It says, the file, that you only
paid part of your taxes for last year.

132
00:09:54,192 --> 00:09:57,252
–That's right.
–Looks like only 78 percent.

133
00:09:57,462 --> 00:09:59,123
Yep.

134
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:01,700
So you did it on purpose?

135
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,962
Yep.

136
00:10:03,168 --> 00:10:05,874
So you must have been
expecting an audit?

137
00:10:07,172 --> 00:10:10,767
I was expecting a fine…

138
00:10:11,676 --> 00:10:14,543
…or a sharp reprimand.

139
00:10:15,046 --> 00:10:18,049
A reprimand? This isn't
boarding school, Ms Pascal.

140
00:10:18,049 --> 00:10:20,029
You stole from the government.

141
00:10:20,452 --> 00:10:25,754
No, I didn't steal from the government.
I just didn't pay you entirely.

142
00:10:25,957 --> 00:10:28,927
Ms Pascal, you can't just
not pay your taxes.

143
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,626
Yes, I can.

144
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,899
You can if you wanna get audited.

145
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:37,397
Only if I recognize your right
to audit me, Mr Crick.

146
00:10:37,936 --> 00:10:40,510
Ms Pascal, I'm right here
auditing you.

147
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:42,974
Now I have to go over
your past three years…

148
00:10:42,974 --> 00:10:45,343
…to make sure
that's all you haven't paid.

149
00:10:45,343 --> 00:10:46,503
Fine.

150
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:50,905
Actually, you know, it's not fine.

151
00:10:51,116 --> 00:10:55,018
Listen, I'm a big supporter
of fixing potholes…

152
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,553
…and erecting swing sets
and building shelters.

153
00:10:58,757 --> 00:11:01,988
I am more than happy
to pay those taxes.

154
00:11:02,794 --> 00:11:06,628
I'm just not such a big fan
of the percentage…

155
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:10,427
…that the government uses
for national defense…

156
00:11:10,635 --> 00:11:14,196
…corporate bailouts
and campaign discretionary funds.

157
00:11:14,406 --> 00:11:17,933
So I didn't pay those taxes.

158
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,770
I think, actually…

159
00:11:19,978 --> 00:11:23,675
…I sent a letter to that effect
with my return.

160
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:28,175
Would it be the letter that begins,
“Dear Imperialist Swine”?

161
00:11:28,253 --> 00:11:29,481
Yes.

162
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:35,188
Ms Pascal, what you're describing
is anarchy. Are you an anarchist?

163
00:11:36,161 --> 00:11:40,791
–You mean am I a member of…?
–An anarchist group, yes.

164
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,130
Anarchists have a group?

165
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:45,769
I believe so. Sure.

166
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:47,466
They assemble?

167
00:11:49,174 --> 00:11:50,971
I don't know.

168
00:11:51,843 --> 00:11:55,711
Wouldn't that completely
defeat the purpose?

169
00:11:56,114 --> 00:12:00,418
<i>It was difficult for Harold to imagine</i>
<i>Ms Pascal as a revolutionary.</i>

170
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:01,853
–Not now.
<i>–Her thin arms…</i>

171
00:12:01,853 --> 00:12:04,089
–What?
<i>…hoisting protest signs.</i>

172
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:05,824
<i>–Her long shapely legs…</i>
–Nothing.

173
00:12:05,824 --> 00:12:08,452
<i>…dashing from tear gas.</i>

174
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,263
<i>Harold wasn't prone to fantasies…</i>

175
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:15,421
<i>…and so he tried his best</i>
<i>to remain professional.</i>

176
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:17,547
<i>But, of course, failed.</i>

177
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:21,306
<i>He couldn't help but imagine</i>
<i>Ms Pascal…</i>

178
00:12:21,306 --> 00:12:26,520
<i>…stroking the side of his face</i>
<i>with the soft blade of her finger.</i>

179
00:12:26,678 --> 00:12:30,315
<i>He couldn't help but imagine her</i>
<i>immersed in a tub…</i>

180
00:12:30,315 --> 00:12:32,715
<i>…shaving her legs.</i>

181
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:36,680
<i>And he couldn't help</i>
<i>but imagine her naked…</i>

182
00:12:36,788 --> 00:12:39,692
<i>…stretched across his bed.</i>
–Mr Crick?

183
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,761
–Mr Crick.
–Yes, what is it?

184
00:12:44,963 --> 00:12:47,659
You're staring at my tits.

185
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:53,138
I wa…? I don't think I was.
I don't think I would do that.

186
00:12:53,138 --> 00:12:54,920
If I was, I can assure you…

187
00:12:54,973 --> 00:12:58,910
…it was only as a representative
of the United States government.

188
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:04,678
Sorry, I'm just having issues today.
So I'll be back on Tuesday.

189
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:11,890
<i>Harold suddenly found himself</i>
<i>beleaguered and exasperated…</i>

190
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,332
<i>…outside the bakery…</i>
–Shut up!

191
00:13:14,492 --> 00:13:16,661
<i>…cursing the heavens in futility.</i>

192
00:13:16,661 --> 00:13:19,097
No, I'm not, I'm cursing you,
you stupid voice!

193
00:13:19,097 --> 00:13:22,032
So shut up and leave me alone!

194
00:13:48,793 --> 00:13:50,988
Hey, watch it!

195
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:21,317
<i>Excuse me.</i>

196
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,996
Excuse me.

197
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:30,833
Are you Miss Eiffel?

198
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:34,561
–Yes.
–Excellent.

199
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,588
May I ask what you're doing?

200
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,367
Research.

201
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:41,492
–Oh, am I interrupting?
–Yes.

202
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:44,548
I'm sorry. I'm Penny Escher.

203
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,390
I'm the assistant
your publishers hired.

204
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:50,916
–The spy.
–The assistant.

205
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:53,961
I provide the same services
as a secretary.

206
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:55,789
I don't need a secretary.

207
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,765
Then I will have to find some
other way of occupying my time.

208
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:01,600
Like watching me like a vulture…

209
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,271
…because the publishers
think I have writer's block, right?

210
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,136
Do you have writer's block?

211
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,243
Are these pages?

212
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:14,913
They're letters. To me.

213
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:18,980
–Are you writing back?
–I don't respond to letters.

214
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:22,187
And I suppose you smoked
all these cigarettes?

215
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,518
No, they came pre-smoked.

216
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,458
Yeah, they said you were funny.

217
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:34,566
What do you think about
leaping off a building?

218
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,236
I don't think about
leaping off buildings.

219
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:40,239
–Yes, you do.
–No. I try to think of nice things.

220
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,374
Everyone thinks about
leaping off buildings.

221
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:46,466
Well, I certainly don't think about
leaping off of a building.

222
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:54,982
They say…

223
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,592
I read this in this
fantastically depressing book.

224
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,855
–That when you jump
from a building…

225
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:10,399
…it's rarely the impact
that actually kills you.

226
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,963
Well, I'm sure it doesn't help.

227
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:17,332
There's a photograph
in the book called <i>The Leaper.</i>

228
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,457
It's old, but it's beautiful.

229
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:24,016
From above the corpse of a woman
who'd just leapt to her death.

230
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:28,009
There's blood around her head,
like a halo…

231
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:32,510
…and her leg's buckled underneath,
her arm's snapped like a twig…

232
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:35,249
…but her face is so serene…

233
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:37,854
…so at peace.

234
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,466
And I think it's because
when she died…

235
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:43,867
…she could feel the wind
against her face.

236
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:53,440
I don't know how to kill Harold Crick.
That's why they sent you.

237
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,981
Yes, to help you.

238
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:58,884
How are you gonna help me?

239
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:01,220
You, who never thinks
of leaping off buildings?

240
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,023
What great inspiration
will you bestow on me?

241
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,525
I'll tell you, the quaint ideas
you've gathered…

242
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,761
…in your adorable career
as an “assistant”…

243
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,863
…are to no avail
when faced with killing a man.

244
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:14,061
I understand.

245
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,096
Do you? I can't just…

246
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:25,511
As much as I would like to…

247
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:29,242
…I cannot simply throw
Harold Crick off a building.

248
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:41,154
Miss Eiffel. Kay. I've been
an author's assistant for 11 years.

249
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,330
I've helped more than 20 authors
complete more than 35 books…

250
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,599
…and I've never missed the deadline.

251
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:49,802
And I have never gone back to the
publisher to ask for more time.

252
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:53,439
Now, I will be available to you
every minute of every day…

253
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:57,276
…until the final punctuation
is embedded on the very last page.

254
00:17:57,276 --> 00:18:01,645
I do not like loud music.
I do not abide narcotics.

255
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:07,146
And I will gladly and quietly
help you kill Harold Crick.

256
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:20,483
I had a very interesting little convo
with someone in your section.

257
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:21,827
Yeah?

258
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:26,502
They said you were feeling
a little wibbly-wobbly.

259
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,167
Catch a little cubicle fever?

260
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,020
Oh, I don't know. I think I'm okay.

261
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:39,646
Harold, a tree doesn't think
it's a tree…

262
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:42,044
…it is a tree.

263
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:45,352
<i>Why was Harold talking to this man?</i>

264
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,326
<i>This man was an idiot.</i>

265
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:54,022
<i>This man used words like</i>
<i>“wibbly-wobbly” and “convo.”</i>

266
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,628
<i>And explained that trees were trees.</i>

267
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,105
O<i>f course trees were trees.</i>

268
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:02,041
<i>Harold knew trees were trees.</i>

269
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,876
I am going to believe you, Harold.

270
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:06,512
<i>What Harold didn't know</i>
<i>was why he couldn't shake…</i>

271
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:09,281
<i>…the smell of brownies</i>
<i>from his senses.</i>

272
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:14,297
<i>Why Ms Pascal had made</i>
<i>his fingertips quiver and lips go numb.</i>

273
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:16,619
Harold?

274
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:21,151
Yes? Sorry.

275
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,921
What's going on, Harold?

276
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:26,693
Well…

277
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:32,229
Nothing. Everything's fine.

278
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,475
Listen, according to your records…

279
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:42,340
…you haven't taken vacation
in a few years now.

280
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:45,676
Let's say you take a little break.

281
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,651
Use some of that vaca time.

282
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:53,622
Yeah. I'll think about it.

283
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:59,328
Harold.

284
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:06,067
I'm not really supposed to do this,
but…

285
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:28,094
<i>Harold assumed his watch</i>
<i>was simply on the fritz…</i>

286
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:33,836
<i>…and never even considered that it</i>
<i>might be trying to tell him something.</i>

287
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:38,104
<i>In fact, Harold had never once</i>
<i>paid attention to his watch…</i>

288
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:40,173
<i>…other than to find out the time.</i>

289
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:44,439
<i>And, honestly,</i>
<i>it drove his watch crazy.</i>

290
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:47,447
<i>And so, on this particular</i>
<i>Wednesday evening…</i>

291
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:51,651
<i>…as Harold waited for the bus,</i>
<i>his watch suddenly…</i>

292
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:53,516
<i>…stopped.</i>

293
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:57,433
Sorry, does anyone have the time?

294
00:20:57,957 --> 00:21:01,188
–Yeah, I got 6:18.
–Thanks.

295
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:07,492
<i>Thus Harold's watch thrust him</i>
<i>into the immitigable path of fate.</i>

296
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:12,172
<i>Little did he know that this simple,</i>
<i>seemingly innocuous act…</i>

297
00:21:12,172 --> 00:21:15,010
<i>…would result in his imminent death.</i>

298
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:17,435
What? What?

299
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:19,635
Hey! Hello?

300
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:21,512
What?

301
00:21:22,215 --> 00:21:23,477
Why?

302
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:25,878
Why my death?

303
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,518
Hello!

304
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:30,213
Excuse me!

305
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,385
When?

306
00:21:33,093 --> 00:21:35,084
How imminent?

307
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:37,621
Okay, where are you?

308
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:49,168
“Harold would brush his 32 teeth
72 times.”

309
00:21:49,676 --> 00:21:53,237
Why won't you say anything?
I heard you.

310
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,652
“That would result
in his imminent death.”

311
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:58,480
I heard you!

312
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:00,901
Come on, you stupid voice.

313
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,580
“Harold frantically grabbed his lamp.

314
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:09,017
Harold, incensed, shook the hell
out of it for no apparent reason!

315
00:22:09,229 --> 00:22:12,892
And smashed it on the ground,
kicking it repeatedly!

316
00:22:14,634 --> 00:22:17,704
Harold took his Kleenex box,
threw it across the room…

317
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:19,420
…then stormed the closet!”

318
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:24,100
Come on. Say something.

319
00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:28,872
Something. Say something!

320
00:22:30,116 --> 00:22:32,107
Say something!

321
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:41,891
“Harold, distraught…”

322
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:45,286
God.

323
00:22:45,765 --> 00:22:47,858
”Harold, distraught…"

324
00:22:50,937 --> 00:22:52,461
“Harold…”

325
00:22:56,609 --> 00:23:00,899
<i>I'm afraid what you're describing</i>
<i>is schizophrenia.</i>

326
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:08,551
No. No. It's not schizophrenia.
It's just a voice in my head.

327
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:12,418
I mean, the voice isn't telling me
to do anything.

328
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:15,199
It's telling me what I've already done.

329
00:23:15,495 --> 00:23:18,328
Accurately
and with a better vocabulary.

330
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:22,134
Mr Crick, you have a voice
speaking to you.

331
00:23:22,602 --> 00:23:25,730
No, not to me, about me.

332
00:23:26,206 --> 00:23:31,143
I'm somehow involved
in some sort of story.

333
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:34,104
Like I'm a character in my own life.

334
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:38,447
But the problem is
that the voice comes and goes.

335
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:42,088
Like there are other parts of the story
not being told to me…

336
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:46,125
…and I need to find out what those
other parts are before it's too late.

337
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:48,963
Before the story concludes
with your death.

338
00:23:49,062 --> 00:23:50,427
Yes.

339
00:23:51,231 --> 00:23:53,900
Mr Crick, I hate to sound
like a broken record…

340
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,198
…but that's schizophrenia.

341
00:23:57,604 --> 00:24:02,234
You don't sound like a broken record,
but it's just not schizophrenia.

342
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:06,142
What if what I said was true?

343
00:24:06,346 --> 00:24:11,613
Hypothetically speaking,
if I was part of a story, a narrative…

344
00:24:11,818 --> 00:24:15,686
…even if it was only in my mind…

345
00:24:16,022 --> 00:24:18,266
…what would you suggest that I do?

346
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:21,660
I would suggest
you take prescribed medication.

347
00:24:22,996 --> 00:24:24,623
Other than that.

348
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:26,731
I don't know.

349
00:24:27,367 --> 00:24:31,921
I suppose I would send you to see
someone who knows about literature.

350
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,934
Okay.

351
00:24:35,842 --> 00:24:38,902
Yeah. That's a good idea.

352
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:41,341
Thank you.

353
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,784
So you're the gentleman
who called me about the narrator.

354
00:24:44,784 --> 00:24:47,622
–Yes.
–This narrator says you're gonna die.

355
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:48,780
Yes.

356
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:52,446
–How long has it given you to live?
–I don't know.

357
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:55,990
Dramatic irony.
It'll fuck you every time.

358
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,987
–So you crazy or what?
–Well…

359
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:01,434
Are you allowed to say that
to crazy people?

360
00:25:01,434 --> 00:25:03,770
–I don't know.
–Oh, well. How many stairs…

361
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:06,068
…in the hallway out there?
–What?

362
00:25:06,272 --> 00:25:08,741
You were counting them
as we walked, weren't you?

363
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:09,935
No.

364
00:25:10,143 --> 00:25:12,045
Of course.
What bank do you work at?

365
00:25:12,045 --> 00:25:14,206
No bank. IRS agent.

366
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:15,939
–Married?
–No.

367
00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:17,173
Ever?

368
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:20,520
Engaged to an auditor.
She left me for an actuary.

369
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,286
–How heartbreaking. Live alone?
–Yes.

370
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:28,890
–Any pets?
–No.

371
00:25:29,262 --> 00:25:33,130
–Friends?
–No. Well, Dave at work.

372
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:37,737
I see. The narrator,
exactly what does he sound like?

373
00:25:37,737 --> 00:25:39,068
It's a woman.

374
00:25:40,306 --> 00:25:41,603
A woman.

375
00:25:41,808 --> 00:25:43,935
–Is it a familiar woman?
–No.

376
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:45,838
Someone you know?

377
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:47,907
No.

378
00:25:48,114 --> 00:25:51,317
Did you have enough time
to count the tiles in the bathroom?

379
00:25:51,317 --> 00:25:53,285
I wasn't counting the tiles.

380
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:56,484
–Coffee?
–No, thank you.

381
00:25:56,689 --> 00:25:58,156
–Sure?
–Yes.

382
00:25:59,325 --> 00:26:01,994
So this woman, the voice,
told you you're gonna die?

383
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:04,430
She didn't tell me.
She doesn't know I can hear her.

384
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,227
–But she said it.
–Yes.

385
00:26:06,432 --> 00:26:07,818
And you believed her.

386
00:26:08,501 --> 00:26:10,503
She's been right
about a few other things.

387
00:26:10,503 --> 00:26:14,064
–Such as?
–How I felt about work.

388
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:16,741
–You dislike your work?
–Yes.

389
00:26:18,344 --> 00:26:21,214
Well, not the most insightful voice
in the world, is it?

390
00:26:21,214 --> 00:26:23,683
First thing on a list
of what Americans hate: Work.

391
00:26:23,683 --> 00:26:26,552
Second, traffic. Third, missing socks.
See what I'm saying?

392
00:26:26,552 --> 00:26:27,519
Sort of.

393
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,922
I told you you were gonna die,
you believe me?

394
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,253
–No.
–Why?

395
00:26:31,457 --> 00:26:32,822
I don't know you.

396
00:26:33,025 --> 00:26:35,731
–But you don't know this narrator.
–Well…

397
00:26:36,362 --> 00:26:40,924
–Okay, Mr Crick, I can't help you.
–Why?

398
00:26:41,134 --> 00:26:44,404
Well, I'm not an expert in crazy,
I'm an expert in literature theory.

399
00:26:44,404 --> 00:26:46,838
And I gotta tell you, thus far…

400
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,143
…there doesn't seem to be a single
literary thing about you.

401
00:26:50,143 --> 00:26:53,646
I don't doubt you hear a voice,
but it couldn't possibly be a narrator…

402
00:26:53,646 --> 00:26:56,884
…because, frankly, there doesn't seem
to be much to narrate.

403
00:26:56,884 --> 00:26:59,520
Beside that, this semester
I'm teaching five courses.

404
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,422
I'm mentoring
two doctoral candidates…

405
00:27:01,422 --> 00:27:04,260
…and I'm the faculty lifeguard
at the pool.

406
00:27:05,726 --> 00:27:09,463
–I just thought you could possibly…
–Perhaps you should keep a journal.

407
00:27:09,463 --> 00:27:11,632
Write down what she said
or something.

408
00:27:11,632 --> 00:27:14,362
That's all I can suggest.

409
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:19,173
I can barely remember it all.
I just remember:

410
00:27:19,173 --> 00:27:23,667
“Little did he know that this simple,
seemingly innocuous act…

411
00:27:23,877 --> 00:27:26,345
…would lead to his imminent death.”

412
00:27:26,547 --> 00:27:29,414
–What?
–“Little did he know that this…”

413
00:27:29,616 --> 00:27:32,380
–Did you say, “little did he know”?
–Yes.

414
00:27:33,854 --> 00:27:36,758
I've written papers
on “little did he know.”

415
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:40,855
I used to teach a class
based on “little did he know.”

416
00:27:41,795 --> 00:27:45,666
I mean, I once gave an entire seminar
on “little did he know.”

417
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:47,497
Son of a bitch, Harold.

418
00:27:48,535 --> 00:27:51,572
“Little did he know” means there's
something he doesn't know…

419
00:27:51,572 --> 00:27:55,796
…that means there's something
you don't know. Did you know that?

420
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,884
–I want you to come back Friday.
–Okay.

421
00:27:58,946 --> 00:28:01,381
No, “imminent,”
you could be dead by Friday.

422
00:28:01,381 --> 00:28:05,408
Come back tomorrow at 9:45.

423
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:08,655
Ten seconds ago
you said you wouldn't help me.

424
00:28:09,723 --> 00:28:12,759
It's been a very revealing 10 seconds,
Harold.

425
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:18,796
<i>Harold was deep in thought.</i>

426
00:28:18,999 --> 00:28:23,670
<i>For a few, brief moments, from</i>
<i>Born Boulevard to Euclid Avenue…</i>

427
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:26,340
<i>…all the calculations</i>
<i>and all the rules…</i>

428
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:30,960
<i>…and all the precision of Harold's life</i>
<i>just faded away.</i>

429
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:35,645
<i>How perfect then</i>
<i>that in this space…</i>

430
00:28:35,849 --> 00:28:38,750
<i>…Ana Pascal would appear.</i>

431
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:41,213
Ms Pascal.

432
00:28:43,524 --> 00:28:45,926
Ms Pascal, it's Harold Crick
from the IRS.

433
00:28:45,926 --> 00:28:47,393
Excuse me.

434
00:28:50,631 --> 00:28:53,361
–Hi.
–Hi.

435
00:28:53,567 --> 00:28:56,331
–Would you like a seat?
–Nope.

436
00:28:56,537 --> 00:28:58,562
There's 11 open ones.

437
00:28:58,772 --> 00:29:00,501
I don't care.

438
00:29:04,378 --> 00:29:05,500
Sorry about that.

439
00:29:17,257 --> 00:29:18,690
How are you?

440
00:29:19,293 --> 00:29:21,523
I'm lousy. I'm being audited.

441
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,124
Of course.

442
00:29:24,565 --> 00:29:26,362
By a real creep too.

443
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:35,133
I think I owe you an apology.

444
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:38,600
–Really?
–IRS agents…

445
00:29:38,812 --> 00:29:42,508
…we're given rigorous aptitude tests
before we can work.

446
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:47,284
Unfortunately for you, we aren't tested
on tact or good manners…

447
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:49,714
…so I apologize.

448
00:29:50,624 --> 00:29:53,718
I ogled you.

449
00:29:55,529 --> 00:29:56,894
Sorry.

450
00:30:01,168 --> 00:30:03,762
Okay, apology accepted.

451
00:30:04,805 --> 00:30:07,535
But only because you stammered.

452
00:30:14,314 --> 00:30:18,604
So you're a frequenter of the
metropolitan transit authority too?

453
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:20,984
No. I'm just late.

454
00:30:21,989 --> 00:30:24,219
Big flag-burning to get to?

455
00:30:25,392 --> 00:30:26,916
Actually…

456
00:30:28,061 --> 00:30:32,521
…it's my weekly evil-conspiracy
and needlepoint group.

457
00:30:33,867 --> 00:30:35,494
You wanna come?

458
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:40,598
I left my thimbles and socialist
reading material at home.

459
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:43,408
So…

460
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,008
<i>Harold nervously made small talk.</i>

461
00:30:51,118 --> 00:30:53,484
You have very straight teeth.

462
00:30:53,687 --> 00:30:55,348
<i>Very small talk.</i>

463
00:30:56,623 --> 00:30:59,592
Thanks. They're real.

464
00:30:59,793 --> 00:31:03,330
<i>Harold quickly calculated the odds</i>
<i>of making an ass of himself…</i>

465
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:07,554
<i>…in ratio to the amount of time</i>
<i>he stayed to chat.</i>

466
00:31:08,635 --> 00:31:10,762
This is my stop. I should go.

467
00:31:12,906 --> 00:31:15,509
<i>–He was elated and surprised…</i>
–See you soon.

468
00:31:15,509 --> 00:31:19,997
<i>…by his somewhat flirtatious</i>
<i>encounter with Ms Pascal.</i>

469
00:31:20,013 --> 00:31:23,183
<i>So elated that he exited</i>
<i>the Transit Authority bus…</i>

470
00:31:23,183 --> 00:31:27,737
<i>…a good 27 blocks too early</i>
<i>and would now have to walk.</i>

471
00:31:46,506 --> 00:31:49,142
<i>–“You ain't down yet.”</i>
<i>–That's right.</i>

472
00:31:49,142 --> 00:31:53,880
<i>Tell us, what is</i> You Ain't Got
Nothin' On Me <i>about, Emmett Cole?</i>

473
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,649
<i>What does this mean?</i>

474
00:31:55,649 --> 00:32:00,687
<i>Well, it's about being around</i>
<i>in the world, doing different things…</i>

475
00:32:00,687 --> 00:32:03,459
<i>…doing what you wanna do…</i>
–Come in.

476
00:32:06,126 --> 00:32:10,119
Mr Crick. Come in, come in. Please.

477
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:13,323
How are you?

478
00:32:14,034 --> 00:32:15,288
I'm fine, actually.

479
00:32:15,469 --> 00:32:17,300
You can turn that off.

480
00:32:17,838 --> 00:32:20,540
Looks like our narrator
hasn't killed you quite yet.

481
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:23,805
–No, not yet.
–Good, great. Have a seat.

482
00:32:24,544 --> 00:32:26,590
–Count the stairs outside?
–No.

483
00:32:26,747 --> 00:32:29,716
Course not. I've devised a test…

484
00:32:29,916 --> 00:32:32,490
How exciting is that?
–Of 23 questions…

485
00:32:32,586 --> 00:32:36,356
…which I think might help uncover
more truths about this narrator.

486
00:32:36,356 --> 00:32:38,187
–Now, Howard…
–Harold.

487
00:32:38,391 --> 00:32:42,285
Harold. These may seem silly,
but your candor is paramount.

488
00:32:42,429 --> 00:32:43,919
Okay.

489
00:32:44,397 --> 00:32:45,796
So.

490
00:32:48,001 --> 00:32:51,961
We know it's a woman's voice,
the story involves your death…

491
00:32:53,573 --> 00:32:55,342
…it's modern, it's in English.

492
00:32:55,342 --> 00:32:58,345
I'm assuming the author
has a cursory knowledge of the city.

493
00:32:58,345 --> 00:33:01,280
–Sure.
–Okay, good.

494
00:33:03,984 --> 00:33:05,713
Question one:

495
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,622
“Has anyone recently left
any gifts outside your home?”

496
00:33:08,622 --> 00:33:10,180
Anything? Gum? Money?

497
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:12,634
–A large wooden horse?
–I'm sorry?

498
00:33:12,726 --> 00:33:14,772
–Just answer the question.
–No.

499
00:33:14,928 --> 00:33:17,764
“Do you find yourself inclined
to solve murder mysteries…

500
00:33:17,764 --> 00:33:21,262
…in large, luxurious homes
to which…?” Let me finish.

501
00:33:21,368 --> 00:33:24,071
“To which you may or may not
have been invited?”

502
00:33:24,071 --> 00:33:25,265
No. No, no, no.

503
00:33:25,473 --> 00:33:28,499
All right. On a scale of one to 10…

504
00:33:28,709 --> 00:33:32,814
…what would you consider the
likelihood you might be assassinated?

505
00:33:32,814 --> 00:33:33,781
Assassinated?

506
00:33:33,981 --> 00:33:38,119
One being very unlikely, 10 being
expecting it around every corner.

507
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:40,849
–I have no idea…
–Okay. Let me rephrase.

508
00:33:41,689 --> 00:33:43,680
Are you the king of anything?

509
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:45,993
–Like what?
–Anything.

510
00:33:45,993 --> 00:33:48,496
King of the lanes
at the local bowling alley.

511
00:33:48,496 --> 00:33:49,895
“King of the lanes”?

512
00:33:50,097 --> 00:33:54,168
–King of the lanes. King of the trolls.
–“King of the trolls”?

513
00:33:54,168 --> 00:33:58,468
Yes. A clandestine land
found underneath your floorboards.

514
00:33:58,673 --> 00:33:59,970
–Anything.
–No.

515
00:34:00,174 --> 00:34:02,233
No. That's ridiculous.

516
00:34:02,443 --> 00:34:06,180
Agreed. But let's start with ridiculous
and move backwards.

517
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:09,317
Now, was any part of you at one time
part of something else?

518
00:34:09,317 --> 00:34:11,627
Like do I have someone else's arms?

519
00:34:11,686 --> 00:34:14,922
Well, is it possible at one time
that you were made of stone…

520
00:34:14,922 --> 00:34:17,024
…wood, lye, varied corpse parts…

521
00:34:17,024 --> 00:34:19,594
…or earth made holy
by rabbinical elders?

522
00:34:19,594 --> 00:34:23,497
No. Look… I'm sorry. What do these
questions have to do with anything?

523
00:34:23,497 --> 00:34:25,833
The only way to find out
what story you're in…

524
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:28,035
…is to determine what stories
you're not in.

525
00:34:28,035 --> 00:34:31,505
Odd as it may seem, I've just ruled out
half of Greek literature…

526
00:34:31,505 --> 00:34:33,808
…seven fairy tales,
10 Chinese fables…

527
00:34:33,808 --> 00:34:36,944
…and determined conclusively
that you are not King Hamlet…

528
00:34:36,944 --> 00:34:38,935
…Scout Finch, Miss Marple…

529
00:34:39,146 --> 00:34:42,809
…Frankenstein's monster,
or a golem.

530
00:34:47,955 --> 00:34:51,025
Aren't you relieved to know
you're not a golem?

531
00:34:51,025 --> 00:34:54,358
Yes, I am relieved to know
that I am not a golem.

532
00:34:54,562 --> 00:34:55,529
Good.

533
00:35:00,468 --> 00:35:02,250
Do you have magical powers?

534
00:35:37,805 --> 00:35:40,181
May I ask what we're doing out here?

535
00:35:40,207 --> 00:35:43,734
–We're imagining car wrecks.
–I see.

536
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:47,548
And we can't imagine
car wrecks inside?

537
00:35:47,548 --> 00:35:49,072
No.

538
00:35:49,917 --> 00:35:52,353
Did you know
that 41 percent of accidents…

539
00:35:52,353 --> 00:35:54,844
…occur in times
of inclement weather?

540
00:35:55,056 --> 00:35:57,432
So do 90 percent
of pneumonia cases.

541
00:35:57,525 --> 00:36:02,428
Really? Pneumonia.
That's an interesting way to die.

542
00:36:03,364 --> 00:36:05,992
But how would Harold
catch pneumonia?

543
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,402
Have you written
anything new today?

544
00:36:08,402 --> 00:36:09,664
No.

545
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:12,873
Did you read the poems I suggested,
or make a list of words…

546
00:36:12,873 --> 00:36:14,985
…buy new typing paper, anything?

547
00:36:15,042 --> 00:36:16,600
No, none of it.

548
00:36:17,979 --> 00:36:19,947
Sitting in the rain won't write books.

549
00:36:19,947 --> 00:36:24,501
Well, that illustrates exactly how much
you know about writing books.

550
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:32,519
What's this?

551
00:36:33,127 --> 00:36:35,635
It's literature on the nicotine patch.

552
00:36:36,831 --> 00:36:40,593
I don't need a nicotine patch, Penny.
I smoke cigarettes.

553
00:36:41,068 --> 00:36:42,330
Well, it may help.

554
00:36:42,536 --> 00:36:45,664
May help? Help what?

555
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:49,041
Help what, Penny?
Help write a novel?

556
00:36:49,243 --> 00:36:51,473
May help save your life.

557
00:36:51,812 --> 00:36:54,452
I'm not in the business of saving lives.

558
00:36:57,018 --> 00:36:59,043
In fact, just the opposite.

559
00:37:02,123 --> 00:37:04,425
–“What's your favorite word?”
–Integer.

560
00:37:04,425 --> 00:37:05,949
Good, good, good.

561
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,287
“Do you aspire to anything?”

562
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:12,190
–No.
–Conquer Russia?

563
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,960
–Win a whistling contest?
–No.

564
00:37:15,169 --> 00:37:19,037
Harold, you must
have some ambition.

565
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,435
–I don't think so.
–Some underlying dream. Think.

566
00:37:25,713 --> 00:37:27,203
Well…

567
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:31,451
…I've always wanted my life
to be more musical.

568
00:37:31,752 --> 00:37:35,153
–Like <i>West Side Story?</i>
–No.

569
00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:37,454
–Like…
–What?

570
00:37:37,658 --> 00:37:41,156
Well, I've always wanted to learn
to play the guitar.

571
00:37:43,564 --> 00:37:45,191
Okay.

572
00:37:47,034 --> 00:37:49,203
The last thing
to determine conclusively…

573
00:37:49,203 --> 00:37:51,906
…is whether you're in a comedy
or a tragedy.

574
00:37:51,906 --> 00:37:53,424
To quote Italo Calvino:

575
00:37:53,441 --> 00:37:56,911
“The ultimate meaning
to which all stories refer has two faces:

576
00:37:56,911 --> 00:38:00,343
The continuity of life,
the inevitability of death.”

577
00:38:00,748 --> 00:38:04,115
Tragedy, you die.
Comedy, you get hitched.

578
00:38:07,922 --> 00:38:10,091
Most comic heroes
fall in love with people…

579
00:38:10,091 --> 00:38:12,093
…introduced after the story
has begun.

580
00:38:12,093 --> 00:38:14,929
Usually people
who hate the hero initially.

581
00:38:14,929 --> 00:38:18,729
Although I can't imagine anyone
hating you, Harold.

582
00:38:18,933 --> 00:38:22,733
Professor Hilbert, I'm an IRS agent.

583
00:38:23,104 --> 00:38:24,298
Everyone hates me.

584
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:26,993
Right, right. Good.

585
00:38:27,141 --> 00:38:31,512
Have you met anyone recently
who might loathe the very core of you?

586
00:38:31,512 --> 00:38:35,208
I just started auditing a woman
who told me to get bent.

587
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,962
Well, that sounds like a comedy.

588
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,051
Try to develop that.

589
00:38:42,857 --> 00:38:43,881
Four of these?

590
00:38:44,091 --> 00:38:46,227
You know, I didn't get my honey,
honey.

591
00:38:46,227 --> 00:38:49,923
Lulu, can you refill the honey
for Larry? Quarters also?

592
00:38:49,964 --> 00:38:51,556
That's my good boy.

593
00:38:51,765 --> 00:38:53,699
I'm adding some acorns.

594
00:38:54,168 --> 00:38:55,567
Mr Crick.

595
00:38:56,704 --> 00:39:00,334
You're here early.
Must have a lot of people to extort.

596
00:39:00,341 --> 00:39:02,206
No. No, just you.

597
00:39:03,577 --> 00:39:06,375
–Twig tea and banana bread.
–Yes, ma'am.

598
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:10,251
Actually, it should only take the day to
make sure 22 percent is all you owe.

599
00:39:10,251 --> 00:39:14,145
Well, I won't be paying no matter
the percentage, Mr Crick.

600
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:18,148
No, I know. But the percent
determines how big your cell is.

601
00:39:24,732 --> 00:39:26,567
You know, you can call me Harold.

602
00:39:26,567 --> 00:39:29,730
Yeah, I know. But I don't want to.

603
00:39:31,939 --> 00:39:33,340
This is for Ramona, honey.

604
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:36,036
–Oh, thank you.
–You're very welcome.

605
00:39:36,677 --> 00:39:38,987
What is that?
What are you marking?

606
00:39:40,514 --> 00:39:42,038
Oh, this is nothing.

607
00:39:42,249 --> 00:39:45,377
Why don't we start
with your backup documents…

608
00:39:45,586 --> 00:39:48,255
…and the receipts
for the past three years.

609
00:39:48,255 --> 00:39:49,745
Sure.

610
00:39:58,433 --> 00:39:59,627
What's this?

611
00:40:01,036 --> 00:40:03,129
–My files.
–What?

612
00:40:03,338 --> 00:40:04,828
My tax files.

613
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,442
You keep your files like this?

614
00:40:07,442 --> 00:40:10,240
No, actually I'm quite fastidious.

615
00:40:10,445 --> 00:40:13,972
I put them in this box
just to screw with you.

616
00:40:27,529 --> 00:40:30,862
–Hi.
–Hi. How are you?

617
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,662
So how was it? Aruba.

618
00:40:34,869 --> 00:40:38,373
Ms Pascal? Can I just ask you
a question about this receipt?

619
00:40:38,373 --> 00:40:41,443
–It was fantastic.
–Just wondering if this nine is a seven.

620
00:40:41,443 --> 00:40:44,674
–And what did you do?
–I got a beautiful tan.

621
00:40:45,313 --> 00:40:49,537
–I'm just gonna guess it's a seven.
–I mean, I feel stress-free.

622
00:40:54,122 --> 00:40:55,904
Do you need help with that?

623
00:40:57,025 --> 00:40:59,261
–Walk to heaven. I see the president.

624
00:40:59,261 --> 00:41:01,630
–It's the taxman. Hello, Mr Taxman.
–Yeah.

625
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,298
–You can call me Harold.
–Okay.

626
00:41:03,298 --> 00:41:05,133
–How the numbers going?
–Pretty good.

627
00:41:05,133 --> 00:41:07,102
–Gonna find that 22 percent?
–22 percent?

628
00:41:07,102 --> 00:41:09,804
Twenty-two, 11 times 2.
It's prime numbers.

629
00:41:09,804 --> 00:41:13,008
–You gonna tax the bathroom?
–No, I'm not gonna tax the bathroom.

630
00:41:13,008 --> 00:41:15,477
–Could I use the bathroom, then?
–Go for it.

631
00:41:15,477 --> 00:41:17,379
Okay. I wanna use the bathroom.
Bye now.

632
00:41:17,379 --> 00:41:18,505
Bye-bye.

633
00:42:00,455 --> 00:42:01,820
Well, good night.

634
00:42:02,957 --> 00:42:04,618
You want a cookie?

635
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,386
Oh, no.

636
00:42:06,594 --> 00:42:10,752
Come on. They're warm and gooey.
They're fresh out of the oven.

637
00:42:11,433 --> 00:42:13,230
No, I don't like cookies.

638
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:16,897
You don't like cookies?

639
00:42:20,008 --> 00:42:23,102
–What's wrong with you?
–I don't know.

640
00:42:23,311 --> 00:42:26,246
–Everybody likes cookies.
–No, I know.

641
00:42:26,448 --> 00:42:30,350
I mean, after a really awful,
no-good day…

642
00:42:30,552 --> 00:42:33,786
…didn't your mama ever make you
milk and cookies?

643
00:42:34,622 --> 00:42:38,114
No. My mother didn't bake.

644
00:42:38,326 --> 00:42:41,454
The only cookies I ever had
were store-bought.

645
00:42:43,998 --> 00:42:46,831
Okay. Sit down.

646
00:42:47,469 --> 00:42:49,596
–No, I'm…
–No.

647
00:42:50,071 --> 00:42:51,868
Sit down.

648
00:42:55,744 --> 00:42:56,938
Now…

649
00:42:57,946 --> 00:42:59,971
…eat a cookie.

650
00:43:00,181 --> 00:43:01,546
I really can't.

651
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:05,083
Mr Crick, it was a really awful day.

652
00:43:05,987 --> 00:43:08,820
I know, I made sure of it.

653
00:43:09,324 --> 00:43:11,019
So pick up the cookie…

654
00:43:11,226 --> 00:43:13,353
…dip it in the milk…

655
00:43:13,561 --> 00:43:15,358
…and eat it.

656
00:43:39,921 --> 00:43:42,297
That's a really, really good cookie.

657
00:43:50,565 --> 00:43:53,271
So when did you decide
to become a baker?

658
00:43:53,635 --> 00:43:56,536
–In college.
–Oh, like a cooking college?

659
00:43:57,672 --> 00:44:00,800
I went to Harvard Law actually.

660
00:44:01,376 --> 00:44:06,507
–Oh, I'm sorry, I just assumed it was…
–No. No, it's fine. I didn't finish.

661
00:44:07,282 --> 00:44:09,250
–Did something happen?
–No.

662
00:44:10,652 --> 00:44:14,645
I was barely accepted.
I mean, really barely.

663
00:44:14,856 --> 00:44:18,193
The only reason they let me come
was because of my essay.

664
00:44:18,193 --> 00:44:22,219
How I was gonna make the world
a better place with my degree.

665
00:44:22,964 --> 00:44:27,697
Anyway, we would have to participate
in these study sessions…

666
00:44:27,902 --> 00:44:31,004
…my classmates and I,
sometimes all night long.

667
00:44:31,105 --> 00:44:34,933
And so I'd bake so no one
would go hungry while we worked.

668
00:44:35,043 --> 00:44:38,213
Sometimes I would bake all afternoon
in the kitchen in the dorm…

669
00:44:38,213 --> 00:44:42,240
…and then I'd bring my little treats
to the study groups…

670
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:44,077
…and people loved them.

671
00:44:44,285 --> 00:44:45,547
Eat.

672
00:44:45,753 --> 00:44:50,019
I made oatmeal cookies,
peanut-butter bars…

673
00:44:50,492 --> 00:44:53,928
…dark-chocolate
macadamia-nut wedges.

674
00:44:54,128 --> 00:44:56,636
And everyone would eat
and stay happy…

675
00:44:56,664 --> 00:44:59,033
…and study harder
and do better on the tests.

676
00:44:59,033 --> 00:45:01,936
More and more people started
coming to the study groups…

677
00:45:01,936 --> 00:45:03,767
…and I'd bring more snacks.

678
00:45:03,972 --> 00:45:06,708
I was always looking
for better and better recipes…

679
00:45:06,708 --> 00:45:12,237
…until soon it was ricotta cheese
and apricot croissants…

680
00:45:13,114 --> 00:45:15,639
…and mocha bars
with an almond glaze…

681
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:20,480
…and lemon chiffon cake
with zesty peach icing.

682
00:45:21,589 --> 00:45:25,616
And at the end of the semester
I had 27 study partners…

683
00:45:25,827 --> 00:45:29,263
…eight Mead journals
filled with recipes…

684
00:45:29,464 --> 00:45:30,988
…and a D average.

685
00:45:31,933 --> 00:45:33,730
So I dropped out.

686
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:37,071
I figured if I was gonna
make the world a better place…

687
00:45:37,071 --> 00:45:39,232
…I would do it with cookies.

688
00:45:44,078 --> 00:45:45,511
You like them?

689
00:45:47,015 --> 00:45:48,004
I do.

690
00:45:49,083 --> 00:45:50,880
I'm glad.

691
00:45:51,953 --> 00:45:54,395
Thank you for forcing me
to eat them.

692
00:45:54,789 --> 00:45:56,552
You're welcome.

693
00:46:01,829 --> 00:46:04,799
I should go. Oh, thank you.
For the cookies, I mean.

694
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:06,768
–Why don't you take them home?
–Oh, no.

695
00:46:06,768 --> 00:46:09,012
–Oh, come on.
–No, really, please.

696
00:46:09,137 --> 00:46:12,371
–No, really, please.
–No, no, no. Really, please.

697
00:46:12,373 --> 00:46:14,432
I would like to, but I can't.

698
00:46:15,109 --> 00:46:16,844
–You can't?
–No, no, I mean…

699
00:46:16,844 --> 00:46:19,540
Because, see, it constitutes a gift.

700
00:46:19,881 --> 00:46:22,650
Actually I shouldn't have even had
those other ones, so…

701
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:25,054
Okay. Well, I'm not
gonna tell anyone.

702
00:46:25,054 --> 00:46:27,890
–No. I know, but if you did…
–Well, I'm not going to.

703
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:29,191
I know, but if you did…

704
00:46:29,191 --> 00:46:32,461
–What, you think I'm gonna call the…?
–No, no. I'll purchase them.

705
00:46:32,461 --> 00:46:35,589
I'm happy to purchase them.
How's that?

706
00:46:37,633 --> 00:46:40,033
And then there are no issues.

707
00:46:42,137 --> 00:46:44,367
–What?
–No.

708
00:46:44,573 --> 00:46:46,632
–Please.
–Just…

709
00:46:46,842 --> 00:46:48,756
–Why don't I just…?
–Go home.

710
00:46:48,877 --> 00:46:50,379
Really, it's not a big deal.

711
00:46:50,379 --> 00:46:52,506
Go home.

712
00:46:54,183 --> 00:46:55,548
Okay.

713
00:47:00,155 --> 00:47:01,452
Did you?

714
00:47:03,058 --> 00:47:06,050
You baked those cookies for me,
didn't you?

715
00:47:09,698 --> 00:47:13,262
You were just trying to be nice
and I totally blew it.

716
00:47:17,006 --> 00:47:20,237
This may sound like gibberish
to you…

717
00:47:22,745 --> 00:47:25,236
…but I think I'm in a tragedy.

718
00:47:55,844 --> 00:47:59,882
Professor Hilbert, I've totally failed
at the comedy-tragedy thing.

719
00:47:59,882 --> 00:48:02,251
In fact, I think she likes me even less.

720
00:48:02,251 --> 00:48:04,825
–I know, it's great.
–What do you mean?

721
00:48:05,287 --> 00:48:07,756
You've proved something else
entirely.

722
00:48:07,756 --> 00:48:11,419
The voice seems to be dependent
on actions you take.

723
00:48:12,528 --> 00:48:15,197
You reset your watch,
it says you reset your watch.

724
00:48:15,197 --> 00:48:17,199
You ride a bus,
it says you ride the bus.

725
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:19,768
You brush your teeth,
it says you brush your teeth.

726
00:48:19,768 --> 00:48:23,795
It may be that you yourself
are perpetuating the story.

727
00:48:24,006 --> 00:48:27,669
–So I suggest we try something else.
–Like what?

728
00:48:27,876 --> 00:48:31,107
–Try nothing. Nothing.
–What about Ms Pascal?

729
00:48:31,313 --> 00:48:32,715
–Forget her.
–Forget her?

730
00:48:32,715 --> 00:48:34,883
Other than numbers,
she's all I think about.

731
00:48:34,883 --> 00:48:37,820
Harold, if you wanna stay alive,
you'll try something else.

732
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:41,153
–That something being nothing?
–Nothing, exactly.

733
00:48:41,356 --> 00:48:44,052
–Nothing?
–Let me explain this again.

734
00:48:44,259 --> 00:48:48,097
Some plots are moved forward
by external events and crises.

735
00:48:48,097 --> 00:48:50,999
Others are moved forward
by the characters themselves.

736
00:48:50,999 --> 00:48:53,402
If I go through that door,
the plot continues.

737
00:48:53,402 --> 00:48:55,871
The story of me through the door.
If I stay here…

738
00:48:55,871 --> 00:48:58,507
…the plot can't move forward,
the story ends.

739
00:48:58,507 --> 00:49:01,305
Also if I stay here, I'm late.

740
00:49:03,645 --> 00:49:06,153
–Don't do anything tomorrow.
–Nothing?

741
00:49:06,248 --> 00:49:10,708
Stay home. Don't answer the phone,
open the door, brush your teeth.

742
00:49:10,919 --> 00:49:12,521
–What about work?
–Call them.

743
00:49:12,521 --> 00:49:14,957
–Tell them you're not coming.
–Don't go to work?

744
00:49:14,957 --> 00:49:17,292
Don't do anything that may
move the plot forward.

745
00:49:17,292 --> 00:49:19,962
Instead, let's see if the plot finds you.

746
00:49:19,962 --> 00:49:22,556
Marshall, you're not kicking.

747
00:49:25,934 --> 00:49:29,638
<i>–Certain that these geese have never</i>
<i>known any home but this one:</i>

748
00:49:29,638 --> 00:49:32,146
<i>A small lake in Eastern Poland.</i>

749
00:49:32,341 --> 00:49:35,644
<i>Pollution from a nearby factory</i>
<i>is slowly killing…</i>

750
00:49:35,644 --> 00:49:39,348
<i>…the small fish and insects</i>
<i>on which these creatures feed.</i>

751
00:49:39,348 --> 00:49:44,787
<i>All attempts to move the birds to</i>
<i>similar bodies of water have failed.</i>

752
00:49:44,787 --> 00:49:48,824
<i>Perhaps it is the familiarity alone</i>
<i>that keeps them here.</i>

753
00:49:48,824 --> 00:49:53,028
O<i>r perhaps it's an unwillingness</i>
<i>to lose the collective memory…</i>

754
00:49:53,028 --> 00:49:56,231
<i>…of the once-beautiful hills</i>
<i>that surround the lake.</i>

755
00:49:56,231 --> 00:50:00,102
<i>And it takes only seconds</i>
<i>for the fiddler crabs to realize…</i>

756
00:50:00,102 --> 00:50:02,638
<i>…that the wader</i>
<i>they might once have feared…</i>

757
00:50:02,638 --> 00:50:05,129
<i>…has now become their prey.</i>

758
00:50:06,475 --> 00:50:09,342
<i>The wounded bird knows its fate.</i>

759
00:50:10,312 --> 00:50:12,648
<i>Its desperate attempts to escape…</i>

760
00:50:12,648 --> 00:50:16,740
<i>…only underscore the hopelessness</i>
<i>of its plight.</i>

761
00:50:18,987 --> 00:50:23,792
<i>The primates' sad, soulful eyes</i>
<i>will be the first to be plucked out…</i>

762
00:50:23,792 --> 00:50:26,795
<i>…then sold to cosmetic companies</i>
<i>around the world…</i>

763
00:50:26,795 --> 00:50:30,999
<i>…for use in the testing of mascara</i>
<i>and artificial tears.</i>

764
00:50:30,999 --> 00:50:35,070
<i>Next, the monkeys' fur will be stripped</i>
<i>away from their limp corpses…</i>

765
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:38,640
<i>…and sewn together</i>
<i>to form pillows and comforters.</i>

766
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,343
<i>Mr Zebra thought he was gonna</i>
<i>take a nice drink.</i>

767
00:50:41,343 --> 00:50:43,178
<i>But you never know</i>
<i>who's gonna eat…</i>

768
00:50:43,178 --> 00:50:45,647
<i>…when you're dining</i>
<i>at Mother Nature's restaurant.</i>

769
00:50:45,647 --> 00:50:48,550
<i>That's gotta hurt. What does</i>
<i>this bald eagle wanna serve…</i>

770
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:50,786
<i>…with some kidney beans</i>
<i>and a fine Chianti?</i>

771
00:50:50,786 --> 00:50:54,779
<i>It's an eel. And again:</i>

772
00:50:54,990 --> 00:50:57,459
<i>Looks like old Mr Crocodile</i>
<i>wanted some antelope…</i>

773
00:50:57,459 --> 00:50:59,695
<i>…to clear that salty zebra</i>
<i>from his palate.</i>

774
00:50:59,695 --> 00:51:03,265
<i>Here's a struggle betting gentlemen</i>
<i>have been known to put money on.</i>

775
00:51:03,265 --> 00:51:07,202
<i>When a mongoose encounters a cobra</i>
<i>it's hard to know who's gonna win.</i>

776
00:51:07,202 --> 00:51:09,571
<i>But this time it looks like</i>
<i>it's… the cobra…</i>

777
00:51:09,571 --> 00:51:11,874
<i>…who's putting the squeeze</i>
<i>on the mongoose!</i>

778
00:51:11,874 --> 00:51:14,309
<i>But don't cash in your chips</i>
<i>just yet, gentlemen…</i>

779
00:51:14,309 --> 00:51:19,061
<i>…because now it's the mongoose</i>
<i>who holds the winning card!</i>

780
00:51:44,306 --> 00:51:46,536
Hey! Hey!

781
00:51:47,309 --> 00:51:49,411
Hey, hey, hey! What are you doing?!

782
00:51:49,411 --> 00:51:51,580
–Holy crapping hell.
–What the hell is that?

783
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:53,982
–Stop the crane. Stop it.
–Stop the crane!

784
00:51:53,982 --> 00:51:56,028
–Hey.
–Hey, what are you doing?

785
00:51:56,151 --> 00:51:57,812
Us? What are you doing?

786
00:51:58,020 --> 00:51:59,681
I was watching TV.

787
00:51:59,888 --> 00:52:03,558
–Well, we're demolishing this place.
–Are you nuts? I live here!

788
00:52:03,558 --> 00:52:06,495
–Is that a TV?
–Yes, that's a TV! It's my TV!

789
00:52:06,495 --> 00:52:09,631
–Well, what's your TV doing in there?
–I said I live here, stupid!

790
00:52:09,631 --> 00:52:11,413
It's where I keep my stuff!

791
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,899
My name's on the goddamn buzzer!
Harold Crick.

792
00:52:15,103 --> 00:52:18,072
Apartment 2-B, 1893 McCarthy!

793
00:52:19,041 --> 00:52:21,509
–Did you say 1893?
–Yes!

794
00:52:28,116 --> 00:52:30,285
I'm not exactly sure it was plot.

795
00:52:30,285 --> 00:52:33,522
I was hoping you'd say it was
just a really bad coincidence.

796
00:52:33,522 --> 00:52:37,159
Meeting an insurance agent the day
your policy runs out is coincidence.

797
00:52:37,159 --> 00:52:41,063
Getting a letter from the emperor
saying that he's visiting is plot.

798
00:52:41,063 --> 00:52:44,226
Having your apartment eaten
by a wrecking ball…

799
00:52:44,433 --> 00:52:46,281
…is something else entirely.

800
00:52:47,703 --> 00:52:51,161
Harold, you don't control your fate.

801
00:52:51,907 --> 00:52:54,342
–I know.
–You do?

802
00:52:55,912 --> 00:52:57,641
Okay. Come with me.

803
00:52:57,847 --> 00:53:00,748
Hey, Tom, can you leave that
till tomorrow?

804
00:53:01,317 --> 00:53:04,654
You were right.
This narrator might very well kill you…

805
00:53:04,654 --> 00:53:09,472
…so I humbly suggest that you just
forget all this and go live your life.

806
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:14,509
Go live my life? I am living my life.
I'd like to continue to live my life.

807
00:53:14,564 --> 00:53:18,898
I know. Of course. I mean all of it.
However long you have left.

808
00:53:19,102 --> 00:53:22,739
You know, I mean, Howard,
you could use it to have an adventure.

809
00:53:22,739 --> 00:53:27,477
You know, invent something, or just
finish reading <i>Crime and Punishment.</i>

810
00:53:27,477 --> 00:53:31,781
Hell, Harold, you could just eat
nothing but pancakes if you wanted.

811
00:53:31,781 --> 00:53:33,772
What's wrong with you?

812
00:53:33,983 --> 00:53:37,320
Hey. I don't wanna eat
nothing but pancakes. I wanna live.

813
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:40,523
Who in their right mind in a
choice between pancakes and living…

814
00:53:40,523 --> 00:53:41,691
…chooses pancakes?

815
00:53:41,691 --> 00:53:44,794
Harold, if you'd pause to think
I believe you'd realize…

816
00:53:44,794 --> 00:53:47,196
…that that answer's
inextricably contingent…

817
00:53:47,196 --> 00:53:49,391
…upon the type of life being led…

818
00:53:50,867 --> 00:53:53,961
…and, of course,
the quality of the pancakes.

819
00:53:55,838 --> 00:53:58,280
You don't understand
what I'm saying.

820
00:53:59,042 --> 00:54:00,066
Yes, I do.

821
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:05,181
But you have to understand that this
isn't a philosophy or a literary theory…

822
00:54:05,181 --> 00:54:07,183
…or a story to me. It's my life.

823
00:54:07,183 --> 00:54:11,882
Absolutely. So just go make it the one
you've always wanted.

824
00:54:19,495 --> 00:54:21,531
I never expected
that they would have…

825
00:54:21,531 --> 00:54:23,566
–Do you want one, two?
–I want one.

826
00:54:23,566 --> 00:54:25,864
–One?
–I want two.

827
00:54:36,879 --> 00:54:38,815
All right, so here's your room.

828
00:54:38,815 --> 00:54:41,409
Or as I like to call it, Sleep Pod Two.

829
00:54:42,018 --> 00:54:43,315
Thanks, Dave.

830
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:47,011
No problem, dude.
It'll be nice having you around.

831
00:54:48,057 --> 00:54:51,291
–How long you planning on staying?
–I'm not sure.

832
00:54:57,133 --> 00:55:01,627
Dave, can I pose a somewhat abstract,
purely hypothetical question?

833
00:55:02,105 --> 00:55:03,572
Sure.

834
00:55:04,273 --> 00:55:06,434
If you knew you were gonna die…

835
00:55:07,777 --> 00:55:09,608
…possibly soon…

836
00:55:10,012 --> 00:55:11,946
…what would you do?

837
00:55:13,783 --> 00:55:15,580
Wow, I don't know.

838
00:55:16,419 --> 00:55:18,588
Am I the richest man in the world?

839
00:55:18,588 --> 00:55:20,783
No, you're you.

840
00:55:22,425 --> 00:55:23,943
Do I have a superpower?

841
00:55:24,861 --> 00:55:26,158
No, you're you.

842
00:55:26,362 --> 00:55:30,162
I know I'm me,
but do I have a superpower?

843
00:55:30,967 --> 00:55:32,902
No, why would you
have a superpower?

844
00:55:32,902 --> 00:55:35,638
I don't know,
you said it was hypothetical.

845
00:55:35,638 --> 00:55:38,698
Fine. Yes. You're really good at math.

846
00:55:39,108 --> 00:55:41,418
That's not a power, that's a skill.

847
00:55:41,711 --> 00:55:44,313
Okay, you're good at math
and you're invisible.

848
00:55:44,313 --> 00:55:47,217
–And you know you're gonna die.
–Okay, okay.

849
00:55:47,884 --> 00:55:50,128
That's easy, I'd go to space camp.

850
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:52,412
Space camp?

851
00:55:52,622 --> 00:55:57,638
Yeah, it's in Alabama. It's where kids
go to learn how to become astronauts.

852
00:55:58,327 --> 00:56:00,901
I've always wanted to go
since I was 9.

853
00:56:01,464 --> 00:56:04,368
You're invisible
and you'd go to space camp?

854
00:56:04,433 --> 00:56:07,469
I didn't pick invisible,
you picked invisible.

855
00:56:07,803 --> 00:56:10,377
Aren't you too old
to go to space camp?

856
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:14,142
You're never too old
to go to space camp, dude.

857
00:56:45,141 --> 00:56:46,108
Space camp.

858
00:56:47,476 --> 00:56:50,246
O<i>ne hundred and twenty-two</i>
<i>guitars.</i>

859
00:56:50,246 --> 00:56:52,915
<i>Seven hundred and thirty-two</i>
<i>strings.</i>

860
00:56:52,915 --> 00:56:55,251
<i>Two hundred and fifty-seven</i>
<i>pickups.</i>

861
00:56:55,251 --> 00:56:58,881
O<i>ne hundred and eighty-nine</i>
<i>volume knobs.</i>

862
00:56:59,522 --> 00:57:04,824
<i>Here Harold stood, face to face</i>
<i>with his oldest desire.</i>

863
00:57:05,361 --> 00:57:08,353
<i>And stand is almost all Harold did.</i>

864
00:57:08,831 --> 00:57:12,068
<i>It wasn't just about finding</i>
<i>a guitar.</i>

865
00:57:12,068 --> 00:57:17,267
<i>It was about finding a guitar</i>
<i>that said something about Harold.</i>

866
00:57:17,473 --> 00:57:19,575
<i>Unfortunately, this guitar said:</i>

867
00:57:19,575 --> 00:57:24,525
<i>“When I get back to Georgia,</i>
<i>that woman gonna feel my pain. ”</i>

868
00:57:25,448 --> 00:57:27,783
<i>This one said something</i>
<i>along the lines of:</i>

869
00:57:27,783 --> 00:57:30,752
<i>“Why, yes, these pants are Lycra.”</i>

870
00:57:31,387 --> 00:57:34,257
<i>These said, “I'm very sensitive,</i>
<i>very caring…</i>

871
00:57:34,257 --> 00:57:38,877
<i>…and I have absolutely no idea</i>
<i>how to play the guitar. ”</i>

872
00:57:41,964 --> 00:57:45,924
<i>“I'm compensating for something.</i>
<i>Guess what. ”</i>

873
00:57:50,573 --> 00:57:52,553
<i>And then Harold saw it.</i>

874
00:57:53,442 --> 00:57:56,946
<i>A damaged and terribly mistreated</i>
<i>sea-foam-green Fender…</i>

875
00:57:56,946 --> 00:57:58,781
<i>…staring back at him.</i>

876
00:57:58,781 --> 00:58:00,716
<i>Despite its obvious maladies…</i>

877
00:58:00,716 --> 00:58:04,186
<i>…the guitar spoke</i>
<i>with conviction and swagger.</i>

878
00:58:04,186 --> 00:58:09,025
<i>In fact, it looked Harold directly</i>
<i>in the eye and very plainly stated:</i>

879
00:58:09,025 --> 00:58:11,721
<i>“I rock.”</i>

880
00:58:12,595 --> 00:58:14,096
Just breathe. Watch it!

881
00:58:14,096 --> 00:58:18,320
We've got a 21 -year-old male
with a gunshot wound to the chest.

882
00:58:18,834 --> 00:58:20,096
There you go.

883
00:58:20,469 --> 00:58:24,906
Shot in a gang fight?
Harold's not in a gang.

884
00:58:25,441 --> 00:58:27,375
Man in tweed?

885
00:58:29,578 --> 00:58:32,915
There's nothing wrong with him,
he just likes looking at sick people.

886
00:58:32,915 --> 00:58:35,110
Oddly spoken with disdain.

887
00:58:35,384 --> 00:58:36,817
This isn't working.

888
00:58:37,019 --> 00:58:39,593
Well… I don't even know
why we're here.

889
00:58:39,655 --> 00:58:41,557
I don't think we're supposed
to be here.

890
00:58:41,557 --> 00:58:44,994
–You said I needed visual stimuli.
–I meant a museum.

891
00:58:44,994 --> 00:58:47,363
I don't need a goddamn museum.
I need the infirm.

892
00:58:47,363 --> 00:58:49,354
You are the infirm.

893
00:58:49,865 --> 00:58:52,601
You're right. The problem is
these people aren't dead…

894
00:58:52,601 --> 00:58:54,647
…they're just severely injured.

895
00:58:55,237 --> 00:58:58,206
Excuse me,
where are the dying people?

896
00:58:59,608 --> 00:59:02,441
Most of these people
are sick or injured…

897
00:59:02,645 --> 00:59:04,747
Which is great, don't get me wrong.

898
00:59:04,747 --> 00:59:07,616
–But they're gonna get better,
which doesn't really help me.

899
00:59:07,616 --> 00:59:11,153
Is there any way to see the people
who aren't going to get better?

900
00:59:11,153 --> 00:59:12,120
Excuse me?

901
00:59:12,321 --> 00:59:15,725
I'd like to see, if at all possible,
the ones who aren't gonna make it.

902
00:59:15,725 --> 00:59:17,560
You know, the dead-for-sure ones.

903
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:20,398
I'm sorry,
are you suffering from anything?

904
00:59:22,732 --> 00:59:24,928
Just writer's block.

905
00:59:32,709 --> 00:59:34,821
<i>With every awkward strum…</i>

906
00:59:34,978 --> 00:59:38,648
<i>…Harold Crick became stronger</i>
<i>in who he was…</i>

907
00:59:38,648 --> 00:59:42,379
<i>…what he wanted,</i>
<i>and why he was alive.</i>

908
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:46,487
<i>Harold no longer ate alone.</i>

909
00:59:46,723 --> 00:59:49,920
<i>He no longer counted brushstrokes.</i>

910
00:59:50,127 --> 00:59:52,729
–Harold, I'll see you.
<i>–He no longer wore neckties.</i>

911
00:59:52,729 --> 00:59:53,696
Bye, Dave.

912
00:59:53,964 --> 00:59:59,640
<i>And, therefore, no longer worried</i>
<i>about the time it took to put them on.</i>

913
01:00:01,138 --> 01:00:05,165
<i>He no longer counted his steps</i>
<i>to the bus stop.</i>

914
01:00:07,644 --> 01:00:12,946
<i>Instead, Harold did that</i>
<i>which had terrified him before.</i>

915
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:16,520
<i>That which had eluded him</i>
<i>Monday through Friday…</i>

916
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:19,683
<i>…for so many years.</i>

917
01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:22,426
<i>That which the unrelenting lyrics…</i>

918
01:00:22,426 --> 01:00:26,658
<i>…of numerous punk-rock songs</i>
<i>told him to do:</i>

919
01:00:27,097 --> 01:00:30,498
<i>Harold Crick lived his life.</i>

920
01:00:39,709 --> 01:00:42,507
<i>But despite resuscitating his life…</i>

921
01:00:42,712 --> 01:00:46,950
<i>…reviving his hope, and instilling</i>
<i>a few wicked calluses…</i>

922
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:50,448
<i>…Harold's journey</i>
<i>was still incomplete.</i>

923
01:00:50,987 --> 01:00:56,926
<i>And Harold's wristwatch wasn't about</i>
<i>to let him miss another opportunity.</i>

924
01:01:05,735 --> 01:01:07,430
Ms Pascal?

925
01:01:07,637 --> 01:01:10,367
–Ms Pascal?
–Mr Crick.

926
01:01:11,074 --> 01:01:13,565
–Hi.
–Hi.

927
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:16,570
–Hi.
–Hi.

928
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:18,748
I'm glad I caught you.

929
01:01:19,583 --> 01:01:20,880
Oh, yeah? Why?

930
01:01:22,185 --> 01:01:25,552
Because I wanted
to bring these to you.

931
01:01:27,324 --> 01:01:29,519
–Really?
–Yeah.

932
01:01:29,726 --> 01:01:34,095
So you can't accept gifts,
but you can give them?

933
01:01:35,031 --> 01:01:36,333
–Listen…
–I don't know.

934
01:01:36,333 --> 01:01:38,969
That seems a little inconsistent,
doesn't it, Mr Crick?

935
01:01:38,969 --> 01:01:40,403
Very inconsistent, yes.

936
01:01:40,403 --> 01:01:42,939
I'll tell you what.
I'll purchase them.

937
01:01:42,939 --> 01:01:44,589
–No.
–No, no, no, really…

938
01:01:44,608 --> 01:01:47,380
…I'd like to purchase them.
What are they?

939
01:01:47,944 --> 01:01:49,343
Flours.

940
01:01:50,013 --> 01:01:53,449
–What?
–I brought you flours.

941
01:02:04,327 --> 01:02:08,320
And you carried them
all the way here?

942
01:02:09,966 --> 01:02:15,097
Ms Pascal, I've been odd
and I know that I've been odd.

943
01:02:16,139 --> 01:02:18,937
And I want you.

944
01:02:19,476 --> 01:02:21,944
–What?
–There's so many reasons.

945
01:02:22,145 --> 01:02:25,515
There's so many influences in my life
that are telling me…

946
01:02:25,515 --> 01:02:27,231
…at times quite literally…

947
01:02:27,284 --> 01:02:30,254
…that I should come here
and bring you these…

948
01:02:31,154 --> 01:02:33,728
…but I'm doing this
because I want you.

949
01:02:34,558 --> 01:02:36,423
You want me?

950
01:02:36,927 --> 01:02:39,452
In no uncertain terms.

951
01:02:42,265 --> 01:02:47,498
Isn't there some very clear
and established…

952
01:02:47,704 --> 01:02:51,333
…rule about fraternization?

953
01:02:51,541 --> 01:02:53,736
–Auditor-auditee protocol?
–Yeah.

954
01:02:53,944 --> 01:02:56,208
Yeah, but I don't care.

955
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:59,943
–Why?
–Because I want you.

956
01:03:05,488 --> 01:03:06,455
Well…

957
01:03:08,725 --> 01:03:11,959
…do you mind carrying those
a little bit further?

958
01:03:12,462 --> 01:03:13,793
Okay.

959
01:03:16,566 --> 01:03:17,965
Okay.

960
01:03:31,815 --> 01:03:33,612
Did you make a key?

961
01:03:33,817 --> 01:03:36,061
No, I just committed it to memory.

962
01:03:36,186 --> 01:03:40,247
–The blue, that's barley flour.
–What's that one?

963
01:03:40,457 --> 01:03:41,822
–The orange?
–Yeah.

964
01:03:42,025 --> 01:03:43,617
I forget.

965
01:03:44,227 --> 01:03:45,194
Right here.

966
01:03:48,832 --> 01:03:50,527
Do you wanna come up?

967
01:03:53,003 --> 01:03:55,528
–To your place?
–Yeah.

968
01:03:57,140 --> 01:03:59,074
I guess I could.

969
01:03:59,275 --> 01:04:03,211
Wasn't that the idea with the flours
and everything?

970
01:04:04,714 --> 01:04:08,878
Honestly, I only figured it out
up to “I want you.”

971
01:04:09,886 --> 01:04:11,877
Listen, Mr Crick…

972
01:04:12,856 --> 01:04:14,346
…I think I like you.

973
01:04:15,291 --> 01:04:20,627
And before I do anything rash,
I'd like to make sure.

974
01:04:22,132 --> 01:04:24,191
I'd like you to come up.

975
01:04:25,735 --> 01:04:27,566
I'd be honored.

976
01:04:28,738 --> 01:04:30,137
Great.

977
01:04:33,476 --> 01:04:35,111
<i>Yeah, he was nuts though.</i>

978
01:04:35,111 --> 01:04:39,015
<i>He got caught when he tried</i>
<i>to get the contract notarized.</i>

979
01:04:39,015 --> 01:04:41,779
No. No.

980
01:04:46,356 --> 01:04:47,653
Was it good?

981
01:04:48,258 --> 01:04:49,225
Thank you.

982
01:04:49,426 --> 01:04:51,894
–You're welcome.
–Can I help you?

983
01:04:52,095 --> 01:04:56,385
No, no, I'm gonna put them in the sink.
Go sit down on the couch.

984
01:05:05,041 --> 01:05:06,757
So do you play the guitar?

985
01:05:06,810 --> 01:05:09,301
–What?
–Do you play the guitar?

986
01:05:09,979 --> 01:05:14,245
Terribly. Someone traded me that
for a wedding cake.

987
01:05:14,451 --> 01:05:18,080
Does that mean I have to claim it
on my taxes now?

988
01:05:18,288 --> 01:05:22,748
–No. I'll leave it out of my final report.
–Oh, thanks.

989
01:05:23,727 --> 01:05:25,058
Do you play?

990
01:05:25,261 --> 01:05:26,963
Not really. I only know one song.

991
01:05:26,963 --> 01:05:28,362
Oh, play it.

992
01:05:28,565 --> 01:05:31,000
No, I don't know it that well, actually.

993
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,070
No, come on. I promise I'm not gonna
laugh at you. Play it.

994
01:05:34,070 --> 01:05:36,314
No, no, no. Maybe some other time.

995
01:05:36,473 --> 01:05:37,997
All right.

996
01:08:03,587 --> 01:08:04,849
Ms Pascal?

997
01:08:05,356 --> 01:08:08,553
–I…
–I know.

998
01:08:08,759 --> 01:08:10,727
I want you too.

999
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:36,280
<i>Harold's life was filled with moments</i>
<i>both significant and mundane.</i>

1000
01:08:36,487 --> 01:08:41,754
<i>But to Harold, those moments</i>
<i>remained entirely indistinguishable…</i>

1001
01:08:41,959 --> 01:08:43,654
<i>…except for this.</i>

1002
01:08:44,328 --> 01:08:49,400
<i>As Ana let out a soft sigh and</i>
<i>repositioned herself against him…</i>

1003
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:51,735
<i>…Harold knew</i>
<i>somewhere in his heart…</i>

1004
01:08:51,735 --> 01:08:54,738
<i>…that this was one</i>
<i>of the significant moments.</i>

1005
01:08:54,738 --> 01:08:58,606
<i>He knew she was</i>
<i>falling in love with him.</i>

1006
01:09:01,111 --> 01:09:03,180
Professor Hilbert. It's a comedy.

1007
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:04,909
–What?
–A comedy.

1008
01:09:05,582 --> 01:09:09,575
The woman. The one who hates me.
Ana Pascal?

1009
01:09:09,787 --> 01:09:11,880
–Last night…
–Yeah?

1010
01:09:12,089 --> 01:09:13,924
She's falling in love with me.

1011
01:09:13,924 --> 01:09:15,893
–She is?
–It's like a miracle.

1012
01:09:15,893 --> 01:09:18,429
The voice confirmed it
in the middle of the night.

1013
01:09:18,429 --> 01:09:20,030
Well, that's wonderful, Harold.

1014
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:23,267
I mean, it completely nullifies my list,
but that's fantastic.

1015
01:09:23,267 --> 01:09:24,359
What list?

1016
01:09:24,568 --> 01:09:26,971
These are seven living authors
whose prior work…

1017
01:09:26,971 --> 01:09:29,873
…would seem to make them
candidates to write your story…

1018
01:09:29,873 --> 01:09:32,776
…based on the criteria you and I
previously determined.

1019
01:09:32,776 --> 01:09:36,974
If your narrator is alive,
she's on this list.

1020
01:09:37,715 --> 01:09:40,818
But it appears the list
is of little use to you now.

1021
01:09:40,818 --> 01:09:42,987
Now that you're gonna live
happily ever after.

1022
01:09:42,987 --> 01:09:47,673
Oh, goodie. This woman, Karen Eiffel,
she's one of my favorite authors.

1023
01:09:47,758 --> 01:09:49,276
<i>–Hi.</i>
<i>–Hi.</i>

1024
01:09:49,293 --> 01:09:51,595
Beautiful tragedies. Just beautiful.
Anyway…

1025
01:09:51,595 --> 01:09:56,123
…let me quickly copy this list for you,
just in case.

1026
01:09:57,835 --> 01:10:00,235
Sociopathic author.

1027
01:10:00,437 --> 01:10:03,099
–I just wanted to thank you.
–Of course.

1028
01:10:03,574 --> 01:10:07,711
Listen, please, you must tell me if you
hear the voice of the narrator again…

1029
01:10:07,711 --> 01:10:09,380
…just for my own edification.

1030
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:10,870
I will.

1031
01:10:13,517 --> 01:10:16,220
<i>Well, it's called</i> Death and Taxes.

1032
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:18,950
<i>Wow. You know, I'm from Texas.</i>

1033
01:10:19,156 --> 01:10:22,717
<i>No. Not “Texas.” Taxes.</i>

1034
01:10:22,926 --> 01:10:25,121
Death and Taxes.
Death and Taxes.

1035
01:10:25,329 --> 01:10:27,464
<i>Taxes.</i>
<i>Like the Benjamin Franklin quote.</i>

1036
01:10:27,464 --> 01:10:29,329
<i>Precisely so.</i>

1037
01:10:29,533 --> 01:10:31,668
<i>This lady's a package,</i>
<i>I'm telling you.</i>

1038
01:10:31,668 --> 01:10:35,372
<i>Tell us, what is this next book</i>
<i>going to be about?</i>

1039
01:10:35,372 --> 01:10:37,840
<i>It's about interconnectivity.</i>

1040
01:10:39,143 --> 01:10:41,805
<i>The looming certainty of death.</i>

1041
01:10:42,012 --> 01:10:43,847
<i>Men's fashion accessories.</i>

1042
01:10:43,847 --> 01:10:45,893
–Oh, my God, that's her.
–What?

1043
01:10:45,949 --> 01:10:49,219
–That's the voice. She's the narrator.
–No, that can't be right.

1044
01:10:49,219 --> 01:10:50,880
No, I'm positive.

1045
01:10:51,088 --> 01:10:53,596
Harold, this interview's a decade old.

1046
01:10:53,690 --> 01:10:56,560
<i>I didn't think anyone actually</i>
<i>wore cuff links anymore.</i>

1047
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:58,255
That's her.

1048
01:10:58,462 --> 01:11:01,192
–She's British?
–She's her.

1049
01:11:01,398 --> 01:11:04,896
–Karen Eiffel?
–Professor Hilbert, I know that voice.

1050
01:11:05,536 --> 01:11:06,503
Crap.

1051
01:11:07,304 --> 01:11:09,807
–What's wrong?
–First of all, she wasn't on my list.

1052
01:11:09,807 --> 01:11:14,471
I figured you would have mentioned
the accent and she doesn't…

1053
01:11:15,813 --> 01:11:16,935
She kills people.

1054
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:20,449
–What?
–In every book she…

1055
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:23,420
The books are all about…
They die. She kills them.

1056
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:26,355
–Kills who?
–The heroes.

1057
01:11:26,557 --> 01:11:29,065
Four Black Veils. <i>What is that?</i>

1058
01:11:29,159 --> 01:11:31,995
<i>It's about a girl who loses</i>
<i>several members of her family…</i>

1059
01:11:31,995 --> 01:11:33,797
<i>…in quick succession.</i>

1060
01:11:33,797 --> 01:11:35,025
Where is she?

1061
01:11:35,232 --> 01:11:40,260
She's untraceable. Believe me,
I used to teach a class on her.

1062
01:11:40,471 --> 01:11:43,941
I've written her letters. I mean,
she's a hermit, she's a recluse.

1063
01:11:43,941 --> 01:11:47,206
Here. Here's the last book she wrote.

1064
01:11:47,411 --> 01:11:50,681
Look at the copyright. She hasn't
published anything in 10 years.

1065
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:53,217
She had knowledge of the city.
Does she live here?

1066
01:11:53,217 --> 01:11:54,885
She used to, yes, but I mean…

1067
01:11:54,885 --> 01:11:58,055
Banneker Press. 2267 Wallace Street.
Is that her publisher?

1068
01:11:58,055 --> 01:12:01,425
You're not listening. I said even
if you find her she's not gonna…

1069
01:12:01,425 --> 01:12:03,009
Thank you for your help.

1070
01:12:03,026 --> 01:12:04,789
She only writes tragedies!

1071
01:12:04,995 --> 01:12:06,975
<i>I don't believe in God.</i>

1072
01:12:34,492 --> 01:12:37,393
Okay, he's bringing her flours.

1073
01:12:48,973 --> 01:12:51,567
Kay, where you been?

1074
01:12:52,577 --> 01:12:55,478
I went out to buy cigarettes…

1075
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:58,584
…and I figured out
how to kill Harold Crick.

1076
01:12:59,717 --> 01:13:01,048
Buying cigarettes?

1077
01:13:01,252 --> 01:13:04,688
As I was…
When I came out of the store…

1078
01:13:04,989 --> 01:13:07,253
…it came to me.

1079
01:13:07,926 --> 01:13:09,223
How?

1080
01:13:09,427 --> 01:13:11,896
Well, Penny,
like anything worth writing…

1081
01:13:11,896 --> 01:13:14,956
…it came inexplicably
and without method.

1082
01:13:15,166 --> 01:13:18,397
I see. Then what happens?

1083
01:13:19,237 --> 01:13:23,641
It's perfect, actually. I can't believe
I didn't think of it earlier.

1084
01:13:23,641 --> 01:13:26,576
It's simple, ironic…

1085
01:13:27,078 --> 01:13:29,273
…possibly heartbreaking.

1086
01:13:30,582 --> 01:13:31,913
Is that it?

1087
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:33,308
Yes.

1088
01:13:33,518 --> 01:13:36,356
–You wrote it on legal sheets?
–On the bus.

1089
01:13:37,956 --> 01:13:39,321
Well, then.

1090
01:13:42,694 --> 01:13:47,131
So I'll finish it today.

1091
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,114
I'll let the publishers know.

1092
01:13:51,636 --> 01:13:53,661
I'll begin packing my things.

1093
01:13:53,871 --> 01:13:55,839
I appreciate it.

1094
01:14:12,023 --> 01:14:14,457
–Hi. Hello. Hi.
–May I help you?

1095
01:14:14,659 --> 01:14:16,771
I need to speak to Karen Eiffel.

1096
01:14:16,894 --> 01:14:18,463
–I'm sorry?
–Karen Eiffel.

1097
01:14:18,463 --> 01:14:20,865
She's one of your authors.
I need to talk to her.

1098
01:14:20,865 --> 01:14:22,799
Well, sir, she's not here.

1099
01:14:23,001 --> 01:14:26,304
No. No, I know. I need to find her.
I need to know where she is.

1100
01:14:26,304 --> 01:14:27,772
We're just the publishers.

1101
01:14:27,772 --> 01:14:32,062
Right. Of course. But there must be
a way that I can contact her.

1102
01:14:32,210 --> 01:14:34,579
We have the address
where her fan mail is sent.

1103
01:14:34,579 --> 01:14:36,889
No, I can't send mail. It's urgent.

1104
01:14:37,548 --> 01:14:38,868
How do you know her?

1105
01:14:39,917 --> 01:14:42,511
–I'm her brother.
–Her brother?

1106
01:14:43,054 --> 01:14:46,023
–Her brother-in-law.
–She has a sister?

1107
01:14:46,758 --> 01:14:49,090
No, I'm married to her brother.

1108
01:14:49,994 --> 01:14:52,622
Not in this state, the one over.

1109
01:14:54,599 --> 01:14:57,864
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave.

1110
01:14:58,069 --> 01:15:00,367
No. Okay. Listen.

1111
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:07,166
I'm one of her characters. I'm new.
I'm in her new book.

1112
01:15:07,378 --> 01:15:11,781
And she's going to kill me.
Not actually. But in the book.

1113
01:15:11,983 --> 01:15:15,787
But I think it'll actually kill me
so I just need to talk to her…

1114
01:15:15,787 --> 01:15:17,948
…and ask her to stop.

1115
01:15:31,569 --> 01:15:34,402
Hi, Harold. Nice sweater.

1116
01:15:37,575 --> 01:15:39,177
Hi, Harold. Phones are out.

1117
01:15:39,177 --> 01:15:41,289
Hey, Harold, 19 percent of 4632?

1118
01:15:45,183 --> 01:15:47,447
Hey, Harold. Back from your vaca?

1119
01:15:47,652 --> 01:15:50,052
Hey. Looking good.

1120
01:15:50,855 --> 01:15:53,297
–He looks terrible.
–Yeah, banged up.

1121
01:15:54,892 --> 01:15:56,961
Wherever he went,
I do not want to go.

1122
01:15:56,961 --> 01:15:58,326
Book me not there.

1123
01:16:01,566 --> 01:16:03,216
He's totally ignoring me.

1124
01:16:06,471 --> 01:16:08,439
Here, look at this now.
There he goes.

1125
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:09,957
It was good having you.

1126
01:16:33,164 --> 01:16:36,167
–Oh, dude, the phones are out.
–Can I borrow your cell phone?

1127
01:16:36,167 --> 01:16:38,431
–The signal's down.
–Damn it.

1128
01:16:38,636 --> 01:16:41,144
–You all right?
–Dave, I need a favor.

1129
01:16:41,339 --> 01:16:44,177
–Sure, what is it?
–Can I have some change?

1130
01:16:47,345 --> 01:16:50,581
<i>Within moments, Harold found himself</i>
<i>running across the plaza…</i>

1131
01:16:50,581 --> 01:16:53,815
<i>…heading for the nearest</i>
<i>pay phone.</i>

1132
01:16:55,853 --> 01:16:57,833
<i>At last, he spotted it.</i>

1133
01:16:59,891 --> 01:17:03,027
<i>But as Harold neared the phone,</i>
<i>he saw it was occupied…</i>

1134
01:17:03,027 --> 01:17:06,531
<i>…by an octogenarian determined</i>
<i>to reach his daughter in Denver…</i>

1135
01:17:06,531 --> 01:17:08,800
<i>…no matter how many quarters</i>
<i>it took.</i>

1136
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:11,302
<i>Fortunately, Harold remembered</i>
<i>a bank of phones…</i>

1137
01:17:11,302 --> 01:17:13,271
<i>…in the Sixth Street subway tunnel.</i>

1138
01:17:13,271 --> 01:17:17,957
The baby's name isn't Mrs. Epstein.
My daughter's name is Mrs. Epstein.

1139
01:17:34,625 --> 01:17:38,095
<i>The first phone</i>
<i>failed to give a dial tone.</i>

1140
01:17:38,095 --> 01:17:40,097
<i>And the second</i>
<i>seemed to be splattered…</i>

1141
01:17:40,097 --> 01:17:42,473
<i>…with a fresh batch of mucus.</i>

1142
01:17:44,302 --> 01:17:46,571
<i>Harold dialed the third phone…</i>

1143
01:17:46,571 --> 01:17:52,247
<i>…fervently making sure to give each</i>
<i>number key a specific forceful push.</i>

1144
01:18:12,797 --> 01:18:14,230
Don't answer that!

1145
01:18:14,432 --> 01:18:16,742
Didn't you say this phone never r…?

1146
01:18:44,462 --> 01:18:46,760
–Hello?
–Is this Karen Eiffel?

1147
01:18:46,964 --> 01:18:48,833
–Yes.
–My name is Harold Crick.

1148
01:18:48,833 --> 01:18:51,605
I believe you're writing a story
about me.

1149
01:18:52,003 --> 01:18:55,804
–I'm sorry?
–My name is Harold Crick.

1150
01:18:56,508 --> 01:18:58,999
–Is this a joke?
<i>–No.</i>

1151
01:18:59,211 --> 01:19:02,481
No, I work for the IRS. My name,
Miss Eiffel, is Harold Crick.

1152
01:19:02,481 --> 01:19:06,051
<i>When I go through the files at work</i>
<i>I hear a deep and endless ocean.</i>

1153
01:19:06,051 --> 01:19:08,918
–Oh, G…!
<i>–Miss Eiffel?</i>

1154
01:19:09,855 --> 01:19:11,413
Hello?

1155
01:19:11,623 --> 01:19:13,750
<i>Miss Eiffel? Hello?</i>

1156
01:19:21,066 --> 01:19:22,260
Let him in.

1157
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:36,277
Hello.

1158
01:19:36,748 --> 01:19:37,874
Hello.

1159
01:19:39,084 --> 01:19:40,986
I'm Penny. I'm Kay's assistant.

1160
01:19:40,986 --> 01:19:43,887
Oh, I'm Harold. Her main character.

1161
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:03,867
Oh, my God.

1162
01:20:07,646 --> 01:20:09,273
Oh, my God.

1163
01:20:10,649 --> 01:20:12,276
Oh, my God.

1164
01:20:17,489 --> 01:20:18,751
Miss Eiffel?

1165
01:20:19,224 --> 01:20:22,421
Your hair. Your eyes.

1166
01:20:23,662 --> 01:20:25,220
Your fingers.

1167
01:20:27,466 --> 01:20:29,434
Your shoes.

1168
01:20:32,504 --> 01:20:33,698
Hello.

1169
01:20:37,909 --> 01:20:39,900
I'm Harold Crick.

1170
01:20:40,646 --> 01:20:42,375
I know.

1171
01:20:44,349 --> 01:20:45,669
How did you find me?

1172
01:20:46,618 --> 01:20:50,019
We audited you
a little more than 10 years ago…

1173
01:20:50,222 --> 01:20:52,400
…and your number was in the file.

1174
01:20:52,424 --> 01:20:57,054
I'm sorry,
but this is incredibly strange.

1175
01:20:57,262 --> 01:20:58,923
You're telling me.

1176
01:20:59,631 --> 01:21:01,743
Didn't you think you were crazy?

1177
01:21:02,367 --> 01:21:03,857
Sort of.

1178
01:21:04,069 --> 01:21:07,839
But then you were right
about everything. Like, everything.

1179
01:21:07,839 --> 01:21:10,242
And then you said,
“Little did he know.”

1180
01:21:10,242 --> 01:21:14,372
–“Little did he know”?
–Yeah. It's third-person omniscient.

1181
01:21:15,013 --> 01:21:16,207
Jesus.

1182
01:21:16,415 --> 01:21:20,185
Which meant it was, well, you know,
someone other than me.

1183
01:21:20,185 --> 01:21:22,954
At least that's what
Professor Hilbert said.

1184
01:21:22,954 --> 01:21:25,047
Professor Hilbert?

1185
01:21:25,390 --> 01:21:27,502
–Professor Jules Hilbert?
–Yeah.

1186
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:30,328
Yeah, he loves your books.

1187
01:21:31,229 --> 01:21:34,164
I love his letters. I don't…

1188
01:21:34,366 --> 01:21:36,601
So you understand
why I had to find you…

1189
01:21:36,601 --> 01:21:39,832
…and ask you not to kill me.
–What?

1190
01:21:40,305 --> 01:21:43,341
I mean, obviously
you haven't written the end.

1191
01:21:44,209 --> 01:21:45,176
Harold…

1192
01:21:45,377 --> 01:21:49,609
I mean, now since we've met
and you can see that I exist…

1193
01:21:49,815 --> 01:21:51,993
…you're not gonna kill me, right?

1194
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:56,347
Have you written it?

1195
01:21:56,888 --> 01:21:58,446
I can… No.

1196
01:21:58,657 --> 01:22:00,759
–Have you written it?
–An outline.

1197
01:22:00,759 --> 01:22:02,828
Okay. But it's just an outline, right?

1198
01:22:02,828 --> 01:22:04,610
–Yeah, sort of.
–“Sort of”?

1199
01:22:04,629 --> 01:22:06,364
–It's just not typed.
–“Not typed”?!

1200
01:22:06,364 --> 01:22:08,066
–Maybe that's okay.
–What does that mean?

1201
01:22:08,066 --> 01:22:11,670
–I'm sorry, I'm trying to write a book.
–What do you mean it's “okay”?

1202
01:22:11,670 --> 01:22:13,905
–What do you mean you're sorry?
–Kay.

1203
01:22:13,905 --> 01:22:15,668
Let him read it.

1204
01:22:18,510 --> 01:22:20,273
Let him read it.

1205
01:22:35,127 --> 01:22:37,561
–Did you find her?
–Yeah.

1206
01:22:38,029 --> 01:22:41,362
–And?
–I may already be dead…

1207
01:22:41,566 --> 01:22:43,363
…just not typed.

1208
01:22:44,402 --> 01:22:45,391
Is that it?

1209
01:22:47,439 --> 01:22:48,736
Did you read it?

1210
01:22:48,940 --> 01:22:51,238
I tried, but I couldn't.

1211
01:22:52,811 --> 01:22:54,745
You have to read it.

1212
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:58,416
You have to tell me
what to do or what not to do.

1213
01:22:58,416 --> 01:23:00,850
If I can avoid it…

1214
01:23:02,254 --> 01:23:04,222
If I have a chance…

1215
01:23:04,656 --> 01:23:06,146
Please.

1216
01:23:12,998 --> 01:23:14,465
Okay.

1217
01:23:15,133 --> 01:23:16,327
Okay.

1218
01:23:55,207 --> 01:23:57,300
And here's your uniform.

1219
01:23:58,510 --> 01:24:02,470
It's a go. Banetta's outside,
she'll assign you your locker.

1220
01:24:03,481 --> 01:24:06,382
–And you roll.
–I'm ready.

1221
01:25:03,642 --> 01:25:05,405
Professor Hilbert?

1222
01:25:07,279 --> 01:25:09,543
–Hi, Harold.
–Hi.

1223
01:25:11,483 --> 01:25:12,814
You look tired.

1224
01:25:13,551 --> 01:25:15,849
No, no, just calm.

1225
01:25:19,291 --> 01:25:21,156
Harold, I'm sorry.

1226
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:26,593
You have to die.

1227
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:28,794
What?

1228
01:25:29,001 --> 01:25:31,492
It's her masterpiece.

1229
01:25:33,806 --> 01:25:39,005
It's possibly the most important novel
in her already stunning career…

1230
01:25:39,211 --> 01:25:42,874
…and it's absolutely no good
unless you die at the end.

1231
01:25:43,950 --> 01:25:45,952
I've been over it again and again…

1232
01:25:45,952 --> 01:25:49,581
…and I know how hard this is
for you to hear.

1233
01:25:53,659 --> 01:25:56,924
You're asking me
to knowingly face my death?

1234
01:25:58,030 --> 01:25:59,657
Yes.

1235
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:02,827
Really?

1236
01:26:03,803 --> 01:26:05,100
Yes.

1237
01:26:14,814 --> 01:26:19,274
I thought you'd…
I thought you'd find something.

1238
01:26:20,419 --> 01:26:21,716
I'm sorry, Harold.

1239
01:26:24,523 --> 01:26:29,051
Can't we just try and just see
if she can change it?

1240
01:26:29,261 --> 01:26:31,729
–No.
–No?

1241
01:26:31,931 --> 01:26:33,330
Harold…

1242
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:37,465
…in the grand scheme
it wouldn't matter.

1243
01:26:39,672 --> 01:26:42,470
–Yes, it would.
–No.

1244
01:26:44,577 --> 01:26:46,545
I could change.

1245
01:26:48,781 --> 01:26:50,908
I could quit my job.

1246
01:26:51,117 --> 01:26:53,745
I could go away with Ana.

1247
01:26:54,186 --> 01:26:56,780
I could be someone else.

1248
01:26:57,623 --> 01:26:59,716
Harold, listen to me.

1249
01:26:59,925 --> 01:27:02,325
I can't die right now.

1250
01:27:04,864 --> 01:27:07,389
It's just really bad timing.

1251
01:27:09,835 --> 01:27:13,333
No one wants to die, Harold,
but unfortunately we do.

1252
01:27:14,740 --> 01:27:16,264
Harold…

1253
01:27:16,942 --> 01:27:18,933
Harold, listen to me.

1254
01:27:21,047 --> 01:27:24,175
Harold, you will die someday,
sometime.

1255
01:27:24,383 --> 01:27:26,544
Heart failure at the bank.

1256
01:27:27,053 --> 01:27:29,248
Choke on a mint.

1257
01:27:30,189 --> 01:27:33,726
Some long, drawn-out disease
you contracted on vacation.

1258
01:27:33,726 --> 01:27:37,457
You will die. You will absolutely die.

1259
01:27:38,297 --> 01:27:41,755
Even if you avoid this death,
another will find you.

1260
01:27:41,967 --> 01:27:47,803
And I guarantee that it won't be nearly
as poetic or meaningful…

1261
01:27:48,207 --> 01:27:50,175
…as what she's written.

1262
01:27:53,512 --> 01:27:55,343
I'm sorry…

1263
01:27:56,549 --> 01:27:59,585
…but it's the nature of all tragedies,
Harold.

1264
01:28:00,252 --> 01:28:04,086
The hero dies,
but the story lives on forever.

1265
01:28:42,561 --> 01:28:47,049
–There's an empty seat right there.
–No, I wanna sit down over here.

1266
01:29:22,468 --> 01:29:23,833
Kay?

1267
01:29:35,414 --> 01:29:36,813
Kay?

1268
01:29:39,451 --> 01:29:42,284
How many people
do you think I've killed?

1269
01:29:44,356 --> 01:29:46,654
–Kay.
–How many?

1270
01:29:47,159 --> 01:29:48,611
–I don't know.
–Eight.

1271
01:29:49,295 --> 01:29:53,459
–Kay…
–I've killed eight people. I counted.

1272
01:29:54,099 --> 01:29:55,828
They're fictional. Get up.

1273
01:29:56,035 --> 01:29:58,003
Harold Crick isn't fictional.

1274
01:29:58,437 --> 01:30:01,201
–I don't…
–He isn't fictional, Penny.

1275
01:30:02,274 --> 01:30:06,498
Every book I've ever written ends
with someone dying. Every one.

1276
01:30:07,112 --> 01:30:09,512
Really nice people too.

1277
01:30:09,715 --> 01:30:13,674
The book about Helen
the schoolteacher.

1278
01:30:14,787 --> 01:30:19,952
I killed her
the day before summer vacation.

1279
01:30:20,726 --> 01:30:22,785
How cruel is that?

1280
01:30:23,262 --> 01:30:26,629
And the civil engineer, Edward.

1281
01:30:26,832 --> 01:30:28,265
The one I trapped…

1282
01:30:28,467 --> 01:30:33,996
…with a heart attack in rush hour.

1283
01:30:34,206 --> 01:30:36,037
I killed him.

1284
01:30:37,810 --> 01:30:39,835
I killed…

1285
01:30:40,913 --> 01:30:43,006
Penny, I killed them all.

1286
01:31:16,782 --> 01:31:19,182
Miss Eiffel? Miss Eiffel?

1287
01:31:20,486 --> 01:31:22,351
–Harold.
–Hi.

1288
01:31:22,621 --> 01:31:25,988
–I just finished it.
–You just…

1289
01:31:26,191 --> 01:31:29,029
Yeah, I read it all in one read
on the bus.

1290
01:31:29,895 --> 01:31:31,556
It's lovely.

1291
01:31:31,764 --> 01:31:34,008
I like the part about the guitars.

1292
01:31:34,967 --> 01:31:38,835
Well, thanks, thanks. Goo…
Well, listen, I'm…

1293
01:31:39,038 --> 01:31:43,600
No, I read it and I loved it.
And there's only one way it can end.

1294
01:31:44,410 --> 01:31:48,147
I mean, I don't have much background
in literary anything…

1295
01:31:48,147 --> 01:31:50,127
…but this seems simple enough.

1296
01:31:53,119 --> 01:31:56,520
I love your book.
And I think you should finish it.

1297
01:32:13,773 --> 01:32:15,875
<i>The night before his death…</i>

1298
01:32:15,875 --> 01:32:20,363
<i>…Harold unsuspectingly went about</i>
<i>some usual business.</i>

1299
01:32:21,014 --> 01:32:23,786
<i>He finished his outstanding audits.</i>

1300
01:32:25,418 --> 01:32:28,154
<i>He made a few phone calls</i>
<i>he had been putting off.</i>

1301
01:32:28,154 --> 01:32:31,954
Listen, does your program
have an age limit?

1302
01:32:32,625 --> 01:32:35,133
<i>And he traveled to Ms Pascal's…</i>

1303
01:32:35,228 --> 01:32:38,665
<i>…where she made him meat loaf</i>
<i>and chocolate pudding…</i>

1304
01:32:38,665 --> 01:32:41,327
<i>…and the two watched old movies.</i>

1305
01:32:43,103 --> 01:32:44,938
<i>It was a nice enough evening.</i>

1306
01:32:44,938 --> 01:32:49,442
<i>And in any other circumstance</i>
<i>it would've seemed commonplace.</i>

1307
01:32:49,442 --> 01:32:53,046
<i>In fact, the only thing</i>
<i>that made this night significant…</i>

1308
01:32:53,046 --> 01:32:55,422
<i>…was the morning it preceded.</i>

1309
01:33:01,121 --> 01:33:03,419
I have to tell you something.

1310
01:33:03,623 --> 01:33:04,920
You do?

1311
01:33:05,825 --> 01:33:07,486
I do.

1312
01:33:08,294 --> 01:33:11,388
–Is it a secret?
–Sort of.

1313
01:33:11,598 --> 01:33:13,088
Tell me.

1314
01:33:14,801 --> 01:33:16,769
I adore you.

1315
01:33:19,973 --> 01:33:22,066
I adore you too.

1316
01:33:24,778 --> 01:33:28,214
–That it?
–No.

1317
01:33:29,416 --> 01:33:31,213
I have to tell you this.

1318
01:33:31,418 --> 01:33:34,012
I just want you to listen carefully.

1319
01:33:34,220 --> 01:33:35,778
Okay.

1320
01:33:37,123 --> 01:33:41,253
You can deduct the value
of all the food you give away…

1321
01:33:41,461 --> 01:33:44,035
…as a charitable contribution.
–Harold.

1322
01:33:44,197 --> 01:33:49,499
No, no, no. In fact it amounts to more
than what you're currently withholding.

1323
01:33:49,702 --> 01:33:51,946
And it doesn't break any tax laws.

1324
01:33:52,071 --> 01:33:56,269
Harold, the point
is to break the tax laws.

1325
01:33:56,476 --> 01:33:59,843
I wanna make the world
a better place too, Ana.

1326
01:34:00,814 --> 01:34:03,977
I think that means
keeping you out of jail.

1327
01:34:07,954 --> 01:34:09,444
Okay.

1328
01:34:10,123 --> 01:34:11,613
Okay?

1329
01:34:11,825 --> 01:34:13,292
–Yeah.
–Okay.

1330
01:34:13,493 --> 01:34:17,156
If you come over here…

1331
01:34:17,363 --> 01:34:21,561
…and talk a little more tax talk
in my ear.

1332
01:34:21,768 --> 01:34:24,100
Because I like it so much.

1333
01:35:47,053 --> 01:35:50,990
<i>Much had changed for Harold</i>
<i>over the past few weeks:</i>

1334
01:35:50,990 --> 01:35:53,159
<i>His attitude towards work.</i>

1335
01:35:53,159 --> 01:35:55,491
<i>His habitual counting.</i>

1336
01:35:55,795 --> 01:35:57,558
<i>His love life.</i>

1337
01:36:01,734 --> 01:36:05,305
<i>But of all the transmutations</i>
<i>Harold Crick had undergone…</i>

1338
01:36:05,305 --> 01:36:10,510
<i>…perhaps the most significant</i>
<i>was that today on his return to work…</i>

1339
01:36:10,510 --> 01:36:14,947
<i>…he was not late</i>
<i>for the 8:17 Kronecker bus.</i>

1340
01:36:17,617 --> 01:36:19,519
<i>What Harold had not understood…</i>

1341
01:36:19,519 --> 01:36:22,121
<i>…about that Wednesday</i>
<i>four weeks prior…</i>

1342
01:36:22,121 --> 01:36:25,091
<i>…was that the time he received from</i>
<i>his fellow commuter…</i>

1343
01:36:25,091 --> 01:36:29,028
<i>…was, in fact, three full minutes</i>
<i>later than the actual time…</i>

1344
01:36:29,028 --> 01:36:31,531
<i>…and, therefore, three full minutes</i>
<i>later…</i>

1345
01:36:31,531 --> 01:36:36,877
<i>…than the time to which his watch</i>
<i>and life had been previously set.</i>

1346
01:36:37,303 --> 01:36:39,669
<i>Not the worst of errors.</i>

1347
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:44,577
<i>But if Harold had not set his watch</i>
<i>to the incorrect time…</i>

1348
01:36:44,577 --> 01:36:48,781
<i>…Harold would have again</i>
<i>barely caught the 8:17 Kronecker bus.</i>

1349
01:36:48,781 --> 01:36:51,117
<i>And he would not be approaching</i>
<i>the bus stop…</i>

1350
01:36:51,117 --> 01:36:54,520
<i>…precisely at 8:14</i>
<i>this particular Friday.</i>

1351
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:55,987
Excuse me.

1352
01:37:00,026 --> 01:37:01,653
Harold?

1353
01:37:03,096 --> 01:37:05,406
<i>An otherwise ignorable fact…</i>

1354
01:37:05,765 --> 01:37:08,339
<i>…until the unthinkable occurred.</i>

1355
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:43,464
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1356
01:37:43,670 --> 01:37:45,571
I need for everyone
to just stay seated.

1357
01:37:45,571 --> 01:37:47,095
Come on, son.

1358
01:37:52,245 --> 01:37:55,048
–What happened? I didn't see him.
–It was not your fault.

1359
01:37:55,048 --> 01:37:57,550
He was trying to help the boy.
Get your supervisor.

1360
01:37:57,550 --> 01:37:58,936
I don't believe this.

1361
01:37:58,951 --> 01:38:01,654
–It was all my fault, though.
–No, it wasn't.

1362
01:38:01,654 --> 01:38:02,848
Is he okay?

1363
01:38:03,056 --> 01:38:06,092
–It looks likes he's breathing.
–I don't think he's breathing.

1364
01:38:06,092 --> 01:38:07,389
Oh, my God.

1365
01:38:22,342 --> 01:38:23,502
Come in.

1366
01:38:27,214 --> 01:38:28,272
Excuse me.

1367
01:38:32,052 --> 01:38:34,282
Are you Professor Hilbert?

1368
01:38:35,989 --> 01:38:37,422
Yes.

1369
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:42,151
Hi. I'm Karen Eiffel.

1370
01:38:42,963 --> 01:38:47,366
I believe we have
a mutual acquaintance.

1371
01:38:48,836 --> 01:38:51,031
Please, sit down.

1372
01:38:51,972 --> 01:38:54,497
No, I just came by to…

1373
01:38:55,576 --> 01:38:56,941
Here.

1374
01:39:00,314 --> 01:39:03,181
–Is that it?
–Yes.

1375
01:39:04,051 --> 01:39:05,746
Have you read it?

1376
01:39:07,387 --> 01:39:09,082
Is that all right?

1377
01:39:12,593 --> 01:39:14,117
Yes.

1378
01:39:16,663 --> 01:39:21,600
I think, perhaps, you may be
interested in the new ending.

1379
01:39:34,114 --> 01:39:35,979
Good afternoon.

1380
01:39:36,917 --> 01:39:38,646
Oh, hi.

1381
01:39:39,286 --> 01:39:41,584
It's a pretty brave thing you did.

1382
01:39:44,658 --> 01:39:47,760
Stepping in front of that bus
was pretty brave.

1383
01:39:49,296 --> 01:39:51,958
Kind of stupid, but pretty brave.

1384
01:39:52,166 --> 01:39:53,895
Oh, yeah.

1385
01:39:54,835 --> 01:39:56,462
Is that boy okay?

1386
01:39:56,670 --> 01:39:59,046
He's just fine. Scratched up is all.

1387
01:39:59,106 --> 01:40:00,733
Oh, good.

1388
01:40:03,210 --> 01:40:04,734
Am I okay?

1389
01:40:05,679 --> 01:40:07,544
Well, you're not dead.

1390
01:40:07,748 --> 01:40:10,751
On the other hand, it looks like
you cracked your head…

1391
01:40:10,751 --> 01:40:13,153
…you broke three bones
in your leg and foot…

1392
01:40:13,153 --> 01:40:16,056
…you suffered four broken ribs,
fractured your left arm…

1393
01:40:16,056 --> 01:40:20,160
…and severed an artery in your right,
which should've killed you in minutes.

1394
01:40:20,160 --> 01:40:21,354
But amazingly…

1395
01:40:21,562 --> 01:40:24,498
…a shard of metal from your watch
obstructed the artery…

1396
01:40:24,498 --> 01:40:27,634
…keeping the blood loss
low enough to keep you alive…

1397
01:40:27,634 --> 01:40:29,101
…which is pretty cool.

1398
01:40:30,437 --> 01:40:32,813
Yeah.
So with some physical therapy…

1399
01:40:32,906 --> 01:40:35,678
…a few months of rest,
you should be fine.

1400
01:40:35,976 --> 01:40:39,313
Well, sort of. We weren't able
to remove the shard of watch…

1401
01:40:39,313 --> 01:40:42,416
…from your arm without risking
severe arterial damage.

1402
01:40:42,416 --> 01:40:44,918
You'll be okay.
You'll just have a piece of watch…

1403
01:40:44,918 --> 01:40:47,821
…embedded in your arm
the rest of your life.

1404
01:40:47,821 --> 01:40:50,654
You're very lucky to be alive,
Mr Crick.

1405
01:40:51,592 --> 01:40:52,559
Yeah.

1406
01:40:56,797 --> 01:41:00,164
–Dr Mercator, Mr Crick has a visitor.
–Sure.

1407
01:41:01,201 --> 01:41:04,728
–My God, Harold.
–Hey.

1408
01:41:07,441 --> 01:41:10,205
–I'm okay. It's all right.
–Harold.

1409
01:41:10,410 --> 01:41:11,900
I'm fine.

1410
01:41:12,112 --> 01:41:14,706
Harold, you're not fine.

1411
01:41:14,915 --> 01:41:18,316
Look at you. You're severely injured.

1412
01:41:18,518 --> 01:41:21,487
–No, I'm fine.
–What…? What happened?

1413
01:41:22,656 --> 01:41:24,491
I stepped in front of a bus.

1414
01:41:24,491 --> 01:41:27,289
What? Why?

1415
01:41:27,494 --> 01:41:31,123
There was a boy.
I had to push him out of the way.

1416
01:41:31,331 --> 01:41:33,390
What?

1417
01:41:34,301 --> 01:41:37,532
I had to keep this boy from getting hit.

1418
01:41:40,941 --> 01:41:44,307
You stepped in front of a bus
to save a little boy?

1419
01:41:44,945 --> 01:41:47,038
I didn't have a choice.

1420
01:41:47,247 --> 01:41:48,874
I had to.

1421
01:42:03,330 --> 01:42:06,424
It's… It's okay.

1422
01:42:07,734 --> 01:42:10,430
–It's not great.
–No.

1423
01:42:10,637 --> 01:42:13,071
It's okay. It's not bad.

1424
01:42:13,507 --> 01:42:17,044
It's not the most amazing piece
of English literature in several years…

1425
01:42:17,044 --> 01:42:19,376
…but it's okay.

1426
01:42:21,448 --> 01:42:22,415
You know…

1427
01:42:24,885 --> 01:42:27,183
…I think I'm fine with “okay.”

1428
01:42:27,387 --> 01:42:30,123
It doesn't make sense
with the rest of the book though.

1429
01:42:30,123 --> 01:42:32,717
No, not yet. I'll rewrite the rest.

1430
01:42:32,926 --> 01:42:35,462
My assistant said
she'd go back to the publisher…

1431
01:42:35,462 --> 01:42:37,987
…and request more time.
–Why?

1432
01:42:38,432 --> 01:42:40,300
Don't know. It's awfully sweet though.

1433
01:42:40,300 --> 01:42:42,768
No, why did you change the book?

1434
01:42:45,205 --> 01:42:46,729
Lots of reasons.

1435
01:42:46,940 --> 01:42:49,670
I realized I just couldn't do it.

1436
01:42:50,978 --> 01:42:52,946
Because he's real?

1437
01:42:53,480 --> 01:42:56,244
Because it's a book about a man…

1438
01:42:56,450 --> 01:42:59,653
…who doesn't know he's about to die
and then dies.

1439
01:42:59,653 --> 01:43:03,547
But if the man does know
he's going to die and dies anyway…

1440
01:43:03,557 --> 01:43:06,725
…dies willingly,
knowing he could stop it, then…

1441
01:43:07,828 --> 01:43:11,821
I mean, isn't that the type of man
you want to keep alive?

1442
01:43:14,167 --> 01:43:17,204
<i>As Harold took a bite</i>
<i>of Bavarian sugar cookie…</i>

1443
01:43:17,204 --> 01:43:21,758
<i>…he finally felt as if everything</i>
<i>was going to be okay.</i>

1444
01:43:22,209 --> 01:43:25,979
<i>Sometimes, when we lose ourselves</i>
<i>in fear and despair…</i>

1445
01:43:25,979 --> 01:43:28,379
<i>…in routine and constancy…</i>

1446
01:43:29,483 --> 01:43:31,859
<i>…in hopelessness and tragedy…</i>

1447
01:43:32,252 --> 01:43:36,146
<i>…we can thank God</i>
<i>for Bavarian sugar cookies.</i>

1448
01:43:36,556 --> 01:43:39,493
<i>And fortunately,</i>
<i>when there aren't any cookies…</i>

1449
01:43:39,493 --> 01:43:44,509
<i>…we can still find reassurance</i>
<i>in a familiar hand on our skin…</i>

1450
01:43:45,565 --> 01:43:48,007
<i>…or a kind and loving gesture…</i>

1451
01:43:51,371 --> 01:43:53,615
<i>…or a subtle encouragement…</i>

1452
01:43:57,144 --> 01:43:59,476
<i>…or a loving embrace…</i>

1453
01:44:01,748 --> 01:44:04,581
<i>…or an offer of comfort.</i>

1454
01:44:05,352 --> 01:44:09,083
<i>Not to mention hospital gurneys…</i>

1455
01:44:11,058 --> 01:44:13,185
<i>…and nose plugs…</i>

1456
01:44:19,900 --> 01:44:22,266
<i>…and uneaten Danish…</i>

1457
01:44:24,371 --> 01:44:26,498
<i>…and soft-spoken secrets…</i>

1458
01:44:30,410 --> 01:44:33,243
<i>…and Fender Stratocasters…</i>

1459
01:44:33,914 --> 01:44:38,578
<i>…and maybe the occasional piece</i>
<i>of fiction.</i>

1460
01:44:39,686 --> 01:44:42,189
<i>And we must remember</i>
<i>that all these things…</i>

1461
01:44:42,189 --> 01:44:44,558
<i>…the nuances, the anomalies,</i>
<i>the subtleties…</i>

1462
01:44:44,558 --> 01:44:46,827
<i>…which we assume</i>
<i>only accessorize our days…</i>

1463
01:44:46,827 --> 01:44:51,381
<i>…are, in fact, here for a much larger</i>
<i>and nobler cause:</i>

1464
01:44:51,466 --> 01:44:54,663
<i>They are here to save our lives.</i>

1465
01:44:55,303 --> 01:44:57,897
<i>I know the idea seems strange.</i>

1466
01:44:58,106 --> 01:45:02,396
<i>But I also know that it</i>
<i>just so happens to be true.</i>

1467
01:45:02,710 --> 01:45:04,143
<i>And so it was:</i>

1468
01:45:04,345 --> 01:45:06,919
<i>A wristwatch saved Harold Crick.</i>
