1
00:00:37,178 --> 00:00:39,169
<i>...and I'll tell you what,
the storm system's still moving west.</i>

2
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,272
What are you looking at, Caroline?

3
00:00:43,317 --> 00:00:44,875
The wind, Mom.

4
00:00:47,988 --> 00:00:50,388
They say the hurricane is coming.

5
00:00:52,059 --> 00:00:55,222
I'm on a boat.

6
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:57,593
I'm drifting.

7
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:02,232
Can I do anything for you, Mom?

8
00:01:03,604 --> 00:01:05,469
Make anything easier?

9
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,839
Oh, sugar...

10
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:10,639
There's nothing left to do.

11
00:01:11,145 --> 00:01:12,737
Is what it is.

12
00:01:14,248 --> 00:01:17,217
Finding it harder to keep my eyes open.

13
00:01:19,186 --> 00:01:22,314
My mouth's full of cotton.

14
00:01:22,856 --> 00:01:24,983
There, there, Miss Daisy.

15
00:01:25,092 --> 00:01:27,822
You gonna scratch yourself to ribbons.

16
00:01:32,733 --> 00:01:35,531
Do you want any more
medication, Mother?

17
00:01:36,437 --> 00:01:39,634
Doctor said you could have
as much as you want.

18
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,004
No need for anybody to suffer.

19
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:59,892
A friend told me
that she never had the chance

20
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:02,292
to say goodbye to her mother.

21
00:02:05,432 --> 00:02:07,764
- I wanted to...
- It's okay.

22
00:02:07,868 --> 00:02:11,395
I wanted to tell you
how much I'm gonna miss you so...

23
00:02:11,872 --> 00:02:12,964
Mom.

24
00:02:14,975 --> 00:02:16,738
Oh, Caroline.

25
00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:24,039
Are you afraid?

26
00:02:24,151 --> 00:02:25,846
I'm curious.

27
00:02:27,621 --> 00:02:29,248
What comes next?

28
00:02:34,795 --> 00:02:39,562
They built the train station in 1918.

29
00:02:40,601 --> 00:02:43,331
My father was there the day it opened.

30
00:02:45,005 --> 00:02:47,701
He said they had

31
00:02:49,643 --> 00:02:50,940
a tuba band playing.

32
00:02:55,716 --> 00:02:59,777
They had the finest clockmaker
in all of the South

33
00:03:00,387 --> 00:03:03,185
to build that glorious clock.

34
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,617
<i>His name was...</i>

35
00:03:08,529 --> 00:03:10,326
Mr. Gateau.

36
00:03:14,702 --> 00:03:15,862
Mr. Cake.

37
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:22,603
<i>He was married to a Creole
of Evangeline Parish</i>

38
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,940
<i>and they had a son.</i>

39
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,977
<i>Mr. Gateau was, from birth,
absolutely blind.</i>

40
00:03:34,254 --> 00:03:38,486
<i>When their son was old enough,
he joined the army.</i>

41
00:03:39,426 --> 00:03:43,795
<i>And they prayed God would
keep him out of harm's way.</i>

42
00:03:46,734 --> 00:03:51,467
<i>For months,
he did nothing but work on that clock.</i>

43
00:03:55,542 --> 00:03:56,975
<i>One day,</i>

44
00:03:58,345 --> 00:04:00,245
<i>a letter came.</i>

45
00:04:05,486 --> 00:04:09,217
<i>And Mr. Gateau, done for the night,</i>

46
00:04:09,923 --> 00:04:12,414
<i>went up, alone, to bed.</i>

47
00:04:15,095 --> 00:04:17,893
<i>And their son came home.</i>

48
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,868
<i>They buried him in the family plot,</i>

49
00:04:25,973 --> 00:04:29,875
<i>where he would be with them
when their time came.</i>

50
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:34,973
<i>Mr. Cake worked on his clock,</i>

51
00:04:37,851 --> 00:04:41,446
<i>laboring to finish.</i>

52
00:04:43,357 --> 00:04:46,690
<i>It was a morning to remember.</i>

53
00:04:47,995 --> 00:04:51,123
<i>Papa said
there were people everywhere.</i>

54
00:04:52,566 --> 00:04:55,126
<i>Even Teddy Roosevelt came.</i>

55
00:05:12,886 --> 00:05:14,751
It's running backwards!

56
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,119
I made it that way

57
00:05:19,726 --> 00:05:21,591
so that perhaps the boys
that we lost in the war

58
00:05:21,695 --> 00:05:23,060
might stand and come home again.

59
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:29,401
<i>Home to farm,</i>

60
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:31,698
<i>work,</i>

61
00:05:33,273 --> 00:05:34,968
<i>have children.</i>

62
00:05:38,278 --> 00:05:40,746
<i>To live long, full lives.</i>

63
00:05:43,917 --> 00:05:46,613
Perhaps my own son
might come home again.

64
00:05:55,295 --> 00:05:57,820
I'm sorry if I've offended anybody.

65
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,663
I hope you enjoy my clock.

66
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:06,437
<i>Mr. Cake was never seen again.</i>

67
00:06:10,811 --> 00:06:15,214
<i>Some say he died of a broken heart.</i>

68
00:06:16,984 --> 00:06:19,248
<i>Some say he went to sea.</i>

69
00:06:24,391 --> 00:06:25,551
Excuse me.

70
00:06:25,659 --> 00:06:28,219
Do you mind if I make a call?
Somebody's watching my little boy.

71
00:06:28,328 --> 00:06:29,556
Sure.

72
00:06:39,806 --> 00:06:42,036
I hope I haven't disappointed you.

73
00:06:42,142 --> 00:06:45,236
You couldn't disappoint me.

74
00:06:46,713 --> 00:06:51,582
Well, I know I don't have much
to show for myself.

75
00:06:54,154 --> 00:06:56,588
Find my dark suitcase.

76
00:07:00,961 --> 00:07:03,862
There's a diary.

77
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:07,091
This?

78
00:07:09,836 --> 00:07:12,737
Could you read it to me?

79
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,538
Is this what you want to do?

80
00:07:15,642 --> 00:07:19,544
I tried to read it
a hundred different times.

81
00:07:20,514 --> 00:07:22,505
Mom, it's not exactly...

82
00:07:22,616 --> 00:07:26,017
It's just the sound of your voice, darling.

83
00:07:26,653 --> 00:07:27,847
Okay.

84
00:07:30,991 --> 00:07:33,960
It's dated April 4th, 1985.

85
00:07:35,095 --> 00:07:37,427
And it says New Orleans.

86
00:07:37,531 --> 00:07:40,261
"This is my last will and testament.

87
00:07:40,367 --> 00:07:44,565
"I don't have much to leave,
few possessions, no money, really.

88
00:07:44,972 --> 00:07:50,205
"I will go out of this world the same way
I came in, alone and with nothing.

89
00:07:50,877 --> 00:07:52,713
"All I have is my story,

90
00:07:52,846 --> 00:07:56,247
"and I'm writing it now
while I still remember it.

91
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,213
"My name is Benjamin.
Benjamin Button. "

92
00:08:00,587 --> 00:08:03,681
<i>And I was born under
unusual circumstances.</i>

93
00:08:04,658 --> 00:08:06,888
<i>The First World War had ended,</i>

94
00:08:07,594 --> 00:08:11,462
<i>and I've been told it was
an especially good night to be born.</i>

95
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,261
Thank God it's over!

96
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,166
We won the war!

97
00:08:32,085 --> 00:08:33,882
The Great War is over!

98
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,190
What are you doing here?

99
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,597
Thomas,

100
00:08:49,836 --> 00:08:51,269
I'm afraid she's going to die.

101
00:08:51,371 --> 00:08:52,531
What?

102
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:57,336
That's enough.
All of you, get away from her.

103
00:09:00,547 --> 00:09:03,641
I came as quickly as I could.
The streets are filled with people.

104
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,012
Thomas.

105
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,113
Promise me he has a place.

106
00:09:10,524 --> 00:09:11,650
Yeah.

107
00:09:13,026 --> 00:09:15,017
<i>She gave her life for me.</i>

108
00:09:16,063 --> 00:09:19,032
<i>And for that, I am forever grateful.</i>

109
00:09:28,642 --> 00:09:30,041
Mr. Button.

110
00:09:45,358 --> 00:09:46,586
Thomas!

111
00:09:46,693 --> 00:09:47,921
Thomas.

112
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:52,091
Thomas? Where are you going?

113
00:10:20,727 --> 00:10:23,059
Hey! What are you doing there?

114
00:10:24,297 --> 00:10:26,322
What do you have there?

115
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,322
- Come on, Queenie.
- Now, Mr. Weathers!

116
00:11:26,426 --> 00:11:29,793
Come on, now, you know I ain't got
nothing but work to do around here.

117
00:11:29,896 --> 00:11:32,160
- Come on. Just take some time.
- Stop all this foolishness.

118
00:11:35,368 --> 00:11:37,131
The air is sweet.

119
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:44,635
You look very handsome tonight,
Miss Queenie.

120
00:11:45,979 --> 00:11:48,106
Handsome as I've ever seen.

121
00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:51,779
The brown matches your eyes.

122
00:11:51,885 --> 00:11:53,216
Oh, hush!

123
00:11:54,688 --> 00:11:58,818
Let's see here.
You ain't no slouch yourself.

124
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,197
Hambert's back in town.

125
00:12:09,302 --> 00:12:13,068
He came home legless, but he's home.

126
00:12:14,074 --> 00:12:16,702
I know you were sweet on him one time.

127
00:12:17,244 --> 00:12:19,109
Sweeter than I should've been.

128
00:12:19,212 --> 00:12:21,112
Miss Simone messed herself.

129
00:12:21,214 --> 00:12:22,442
Oh, sweet Jesus.

130
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:25,074
She got to stop doing that
or it's diapers for her.

131
00:12:25,185 --> 00:12:27,210
- I'll be right there, Miss Jameson!
- Now, Queenie, now come on.

132
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,880
Okay, Queenie'll be right there.

133
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,252
It's awful nice out here.

134
00:12:31,358 --> 00:12:34,555
Come on out back for a moment.
Take your mind off things.

135
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:35,685
You're so bad.

136
00:12:35,795 --> 00:12:38,263
- What in God's name?
- What's this?

137
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,872
Oh, the Lord done something here.

138
00:12:50,977 --> 00:12:54,469
Hope I didn't hurt it none
stepping on it like that.

139
00:12:54,581 --> 00:12:56,105
We best leave that for the police.

140
00:12:56,216 --> 00:12:57,706
Poor baby.

141
00:12:58,551 --> 00:12:59,882
I'll go.

142
00:13:00,553 --> 00:13:04,216
It's for sure nobody wanted to keep it.
Come on, baby.

143
00:13:06,893 --> 00:13:09,327
Queenie? Where are you, Queenie?

144
00:13:09,429 --> 00:13:11,363
Hold your water! You go deal with it.

145
00:13:11,464 --> 00:13:13,557
Okay. No, go, I'll be back.

146
00:13:14,434 --> 00:13:17,699
Queenie, Apple, she went and messed
herself all over again!

147
00:13:17,804 --> 00:13:19,669
Jane Childress, start her a bath!

148
00:13:19,773 --> 00:13:21,832
And mind your own business,
Mrs. Duprey.

149
00:13:21,942 --> 00:13:23,739
You'll be messing yourself
soon enough.

150
00:13:23,843 --> 00:13:25,401
Somebody stole my necklace.

151
00:13:25,512 --> 00:13:28,447
Okay. All right, Mrs. Hollister,
I'll be right with you, okay?

152
00:13:28,548 --> 00:13:30,743
Go on back upstairs, hear?

153
00:13:37,057 --> 00:13:39,582
You are as ugly as an old pot

154
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,354
but you're still a child of God.

155
00:13:41,461 --> 00:13:43,827
Queenie, Apple,
she won't take a bath without you!

156
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,397
Mercy.

157
00:13:45,498 --> 00:13:47,466
I'll be right there!

158
00:13:50,503 --> 00:13:53,438
Okay. You just wait right here
for me now, okay?

159
00:13:56,776 --> 00:14:01,406
My sister gave me those pearls.
I can't find them anywhere.

160
00:14:01,514 --> 00:14:05,348
- Somebody's been stealing my jewelry.
- They're right here, Mrs. Hollister. See?

161
00:14:05,452 --> 00:14:08,751
Right around your pretty white neck.
Now, come on. Hush all that noise.

162
00:14:08,855 --> 00:14:11,449
- Is Dr. Rose still here?
- I don't know.

163
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,557
Your heart is strong.

164
00:14:15,662 --> 00:14:18,631
You just want to avoid
any undue stimulation.

165
00:14:19,232 --> 00:14:22,326
I trust you ladies
will help me out with that?

166
00:14:22,435 --> 00:14:25,563
I have something.
Could you come downstairs?

167
00:14:29,275 --> 00:14:32,972
Never seen anything like it.
Nearly blind from cataracts.

168
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:37,140
I'm not sure if he can hear.
His bones indicate severe arthritis.

169
00:14:37,984 --> 00:14:42,353
His skin has lost all elasticity,
and his hands and feet are ossified.

170
00:14:42,455 --> 00:14:47,051
He shows all the deterioration,
the infirmities, not of a newborn,

171
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,788
but of a man well in his 80s
on his way to the grave.

172
00:14:49,896 --> 00:14:50,885
He's dying?

173
00:14:50,997 --> 00:14:54,228
His body is failing him
before his life's begun.

174
00:14:56,603 --> 00:14:58,036
Where'd he come from?

175
00:14:58,138 --> 00:15:02,507
My sister's child. From Lafayette.
She had an unfortunate adventure.

176
00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:06,511
The poor child, he got the worst of it.
Come out white.

177
00:15:09,549 --> 00:15:14,145
There are places for unwanted babies
like these, Queenie.

178
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:17,450
No room for another mouth to feed here.

179
00:15:17,557 --> 00:15:20,082
The Nolan Foundation,
despite their good intentions,

180
00:15:20,193 --> 00:15:22,957
thinks this place is
a large nuisance as it is.

181
00:15:23,063 --> 00:15:24,142
- A baby...
- You said he don't have long.

182
00:15:24,177 --> 00:15:25,222
- A baby...
- You said he don't have long.

183
00:15:25,331 --> 00:15:29,893
Queenie, some creatures
aren't meant to survive.

184
00:15:33,306 --> 00:15:37,037
No, this baby, he is a miracle.
That's for certain.

185
00:15:37,143 --> 00:15:40,135
Just not the kind of miracle
one hopes to see.

186
00:15:43,183 --> 00:15:45,674
Y'all listen. Y'all listen up here.

187
00:15:46,453 --> 00:15:47,477
We're gonna have us a visitor

188
00:15:47,587 --> 00:15:50,681
that's gonna be staying with us
for a little while.

189
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:54,487
My sister had a child
and she couldn't see right by it, so...

190
00:15:56,763 --> 00:15:58,492
He's known as...

191
00:16:01,768 --> 00:16:03,065
Benjamin.

192
00:16:03,736 --> 00:16:05,033
Benjamin.

193
00:16:05,939 --> 00:16:08,874
He's not a well child, so we're gonna
have to take good care of him.

194
00:16:08,975 --> 00:16:10,033
I had 10 children.

195
00:16:10,143 --> 00:16:13,476
There's not a baby I can't care for.
Let me see him.

196
00:16:15,682 --> 00:16:19,311
God in Heaven.
He looks just like my ex-husband.

197
00:16:20,153 --> 00:16:22,781
Look, he's prematurely old.

198
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:26,816
Dr. Rose said he ain't got much more
time on this earth.

199
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,286
Join the club.

200
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:34,866
He's smiling!

201
00:16:41,641 --> 00:16:44,303
Hambert sends his
remembrances to you.

202
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,452
Are you right out of your mind?

203
00:16:57,757 --> 00:17:01,124
I know you ain't got all the parts
it takes to make one of your own,

204
00:17:01,227 --> 00:17:02,455
but this ain't yours to keep.

205
00:17:02,562 --> 00:17:04,826
It may not even be humankind.

206
00:17:13,973 --> 00:17:16,373
Mr. Weathers, come back here.

207
00:17:18,711 --> 00:17:19,939
Please.

208
00:17:36,296 --> 00:17:38,856
You never know what's coming for you.

209
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,241
<i>It seemed I had found a home.</i>

210
00:17:54,414 --> 00:17:55,472
Is any of this true?

211
00:17:55,582 --> 00:17:58,949
You have such a lovely voice.

212
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:04,183
Mom, it's an ancient streetcar token.

213
00:18:05,892 --> 00:18:09,020
That clock just kept going,

214
00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:14,227
year after year after year.

215
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:20,438
<i>But I didn't know I was a child.</i>

216
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,008
Same old crap every day.

217
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,674
<i>I thought I was like everyone else there.</i>

218
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,841
<i>An old man in the twilight of his life.</i>

219
00:18:29,949 --> 00:18:32,281
Could you make him stop that?

220
00:18:33,286 --> 00:18:36,346
Stop banging that fork.
It's used for eating, not for playing with.

221
00:18:36,456 --> 00:18:39,289
And use your napkin, please,
Mr. Benjamin.

222
00:18:41,661 --> 00:18:42,923
Queenie!

223
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,305
Hey, boy.

224
00:19:03,683 --> 00:19:05,981
<i>Always had a healthy curiosity.</i>

225
00:19:07,153 --> 00:19:10,611
<i>What was up the street?
Or around the next corner?</i>

226
00:19:12,492 --> 00:19:13,789
Go get him!

227
00:19:13,893 --> 00:19:17,590
Benjamin! That is dangerous.
Come back over here.

228
00:19:18,331 --> 00:19:20,060
Stay put, child.

229
00:19:22,435 --> 00:19:24,369
<i>I loved her very much.</i>

230
00:19:25,171 --> 00:19:26,798
<i>She was my mother.</i>

231
00:19:26,906 --> 00:19:28,066
Mama.

232
00:19:28,775 --> 00:19:29,901
Mama.

233
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:34,476
Some days I feel different
than the day before.

234
00:19:35,915 --> 00:19:39,942
Everybody feels different about
themselves, one way or another.

235
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,218
But we're all going the same way.

236
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:48,253
Just taking different roads to get there,
that's all.

237
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:50,829
You're on your own road, Benjamin.

238
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:56,261
Mama? How much longer I got?

239
00:19:56,769 --> 00:20:00,068
Just be thankful
for what you're given, hear?

240
00:20:00,173 --> 00:20:03,233
You're already here longer
than you're supposed to.

241
00:20:06,145 --> 00:20:09,046
<i>Some nights, I'd have to sleep alone.</i>

242
00:20:17,757 --> 00:20:19,418
<i>I didn't mind.</i>

243
00:20:20,326 --> 00:20:23,056
<i>I would listen to the house breathing.</i>

244
00:20:24,263 --> 00:20:26,322
<i>All those people sleeping.</i>

245
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,995
<i>I felt safe.</i>

246
00:20:50,857 --> 00:20:53,451
<i>It was a place of great routine.</i>

247
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:56,460
<i>Every morning at 5:30,
no matter the weather,</i>

248
00:20:56,562 --> 00:21:00,623
<i>General Winslow, U.S. Army, Retired,
would raise the flag.</i>

249
00:21:03,503 --> 00:21:07,462
<i>Mrs. Sybil Wagner,
once an opera singer of some note,</i>

250
00:21:07,573 --> 00:21:10,201
<i>well, she sang Wagner.</i>

251
00:21:22,021 --> 00:21:23,454
All right, baby, come on.

252
00:21:23,556 --> 00:21:27,390
We got to put some life
into these old sticks for you.

253
00:21:27,493 --> 00:21:31,793
Get you walking so you can help me out
around here. Come on now, hear?

254
00:21:32,899 --> 00:21:36,733
<i>No matter the season,
supper was served promptly at 5:30.</i>

255
00:21:36,836 --> 00:21:38,997
Molasses.

256
00:21:39,105 --> 00:21:40,333
Molasses.

257
00:21:41,574 --> 00:21:43,132
Molasses.

258
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:46,635
I learned to read when I was five.

259
00:21:47,747 --> 00:21:51,148
My grandfather was a dresser
for a famous actor.

260
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,946
He brung home every play
for me to read.

261
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:59,920
"Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,

262
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:04,455
"Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.

263
00:22:05,231 --> 00:22:07,961
"Even like a man
new haled from the rack,

264
00:22:08,067 --> 00:22:10,763
"So fare my limbs
with long imprisonment.

265
00:22:11,504 --> 00:22:15,133
"And these gray locks,
the pursuivants of death,

266
00:22:15,775 --> 00:22:18,744
"Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer. "

267
00:22:22,648 --> 00:22:24,179
You thought I was plain ignorant,
didn't you?

268
00:22:24,214 --> 00:22:25,710
You thought I was plain ignorant,
didn't you?

269
00:22:25,818 --> 00:22:29,447
The actor my grandfather worked for
was John Wilkes Booth.

270
00:22:31,757 --> 00:22:33,782
He killed Abraham Lincoln.

271
00:22:35,561 --> 00:22:38,189
You never know what's coming for you.

272
00:22:38,898 --> 00:22:42,493
<i>On Saturday nights,
Mama would make me go to church.</i>

273
00:22:46,305 --> 00:22:47,670
Benjamin!

274
00:22:58,017 --> 00:22:59,575
- Amen! Amen!
- Amen! Amen!

275
00:23:02,188 --> 00:23:04,520
What can I do for you, sister?

276
00:23:14,367 --> 00:23:19,828
Her parts are all twisted up inside
and she can't have little children.

277
00:23:23,643 --> 00:23:27,670
Lord, if you could see clear
to forgive this woman her sins

278
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,873
so she can bear the fruit of the womb.

279
00:23:29,982 --> 00:23:32,382
Out, damnable affliction!

280
00:23:32,485 --> 00:23:34,646
- Praise God!
- Praise God!

281
00:23:34,754 --> 00:23:35,914
Hallelujah!

282
00:23:36,022 --> 00:23:37,489
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

283
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:42,289
And what's this old man's irrediction?

284
00:23:43,996 --> 00:23:45,429
He's got the Devil on his back,

285
00:23:45,531 --> 00:23:48,796
trying to ride him into the grave
before his time.

286
00:23:52,104 --> 00:23:53,537
- Out, Zebuchar!
- Yes!

287
00:23:53,639 --> 00:23:55,470
- Out, Beelzebub!
- Yes!

288
00:23:57,376 --> 00:23:59,105
How old are you?

289
00:23:59,211 --> 00:24:01,702
Seven. But I look a lot older.

290
00:24:02,782 --> 00:24:04,272
God bless you.

291
00:24:04,884 --> 00:24:06,351
He's seven.

292
00:24:09,155 --> 00:24:13,091
Now, this is a man
with optimism in his heart.

293
00:24:13,192 --> 00:24:14,887
- All right.
- Belief in his soul!

294
00:24:14,994 --> 00:24:15,983
- Yes!
- Yes!

295
00:24:16,095 --> 00:24:17,892
We are all children in the eyes of God!

296
00:24:17,997 --> 00:24:19,294
- Yes!
- Hallelujah!

297
00:24:19,398 --> 00:24:22,265
We are gonna get you out of that chair.

298
00:24:22,368 --> 00:24:24,393
- And we're gonna have you walk.
- Amen.

299
00:24:25,271 --> 00:24:26,829
It's all right.

300
00:24:27,773 --> 00:24:29,968
In the name of God's glory...

301
00:24:30,843 --> 00:24:32,276
Rise up!

302
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:35,144
Come on.

303
00:24:36,983 --> 00:24:38,746
Come on. Walk.

304
00:24:38,851 --> 00:24:40,284
Come on, son. Come on.

305
00:24:40,386 --> 00:24:43,116
- Come on with it, son. Come on.
- Come on.

306
00:24:43,222 --> 00:24:46,589
Now God is gonna see you
the rest of the way.

307
00:24:46,692 --> 00:24:51,493
He's gonna see this little old man walk
without the use of a crutch or a cane.

308
00:24:51,597 --> 00:24:53,394
He's gonna see that you walk
from faith...

309
00:24:53,499 --> 00:24:56,468
- Hallelujah!
- ... and divine inspiration alone!

310
00:24:56,569 --> 00:24:57,729
- Yes.
- Hey, Ben!

311
00:24:57,837 --> 00:24:59,134
- Go, son!
- Now walk.

312
00:24:59,238 --> 00:25:00,466
- Yes.
- Come on.

313
00:25:02,608 --> 00:25:04,235
Don't touch him.

314
00:25:06,612 --> 00:25:08,341
Rise up, old man.

315
00:25:09,415 --> 00:25:11,975
Rise up like Lazarus.

316
00:25:12,084 --> 00:25:14,211
I said, rise up!

317
00:25:14,887 --> 00:25:16,252
Hallelujah!

318
00:25:18,424 --> 00:25:19,618
Yes.

319
00:25:20,092 --> 00:25:21,286
Come on.

320
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,383
Say hallelujah.

321
00:25:22,495 --> 00:25:23,860
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

322
00:25:25,598 --> 00:25:26,792
Walk.

323
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,659
Walk on. Yes.

324
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:34,563
That's right, Benjamin.

325
00:25:34,674 --> 00:25:37,905
<i>Now when I look back on it,
it was miraculous.</i>

326
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:42,037
<i>But you know the saying, the Lord
giveth and the Lord taketh away.</i>

327
00:25:42,314 --> 00:25:44,179
Glory in the highest!

328
00:25:48,287 --> 00:25:49,447
Sweet Jesus!

329
00:25:49,588 --> 00:25:50,680
- No!
- No!

330
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:54,490
<i>There were so many birthdays.</i>

331
00:25:54,593 --> 00:25:58,120
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow...</i>

332
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,824
<i>So we wouldn't run out,
we would spare the candles.</i>

333
00:26:00,933 --> 00:26:04,960
Queenie, you know I don't like birthdays
and I don't like cake.

334
00:26:05,671 --> 00:26:09,607
<i>And death was a common visitor.
People came and went.</i>

335
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,844
<i>You always knew
when someone left us.</i>

336
00:26:13,946 --> 00:26:16,437
<i>There was a silence in the house.</i>

337
00:26:30,529 --> 00:26:32,793
<i>It was a wonderful place to grow up.</i>

338
00:26:32,898 --> 00:26:37,358
<i>I was with people who had shed
all the inconsequences of earlier life.</i>

339
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:42,166
<i>Left wondering about the weather,
the temperature of a bath,</i>

340
00:26:43,409 --> 00:26:45,604
<i>the light at the end of a day.</i>

341
00:26:50,015 --> 00:26:53,974
<i>For everyone that died, someone would
come to take their place.</i>

342
00:26:55,054 --> 00:26:57,318
I've been married five times.

343
00:26:57,857 --> 00:27:01,554
My fifth wife and I are captured
by a neighbor tribe of cannibals.

344
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,718
Oh, goodness gracious.

345
00:27:02,828 --> 00:27:04,295
We escaped across the river.

346
00:27:04,396 --> 00:27:07,763
My wife, she can't swim,
so, sadly, she eaten.

347
00:27:07,867 --> 00:27:09,061
Oh, my God.

348
00:27:09,168 --> 00:27:12,001
My second wife steps on cobra
and dies.

349
00:27:12,571 --> 00:27:15,335
It was very bad luck
to be married to me.

350
00:27:15,441 --> 00:27:18,467
That's Mr. Oti. He's an acquaintance
of an acquaintance of mine.

351
00:27:18,577 --> 00:27:20,670
- The next summer I'm captured...
- He's a Pygmy.

352
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,645
...with three others
by the Baschiele tribe.

353
00:27:22,748 --> 00:27:27,617
They trade us for pigs, shoes, and beer
to a very strange American man.

354
00:27:46,739 --> 00:27:49,230
I hear you're not so old
as you're looking.

355
00:27:49,341 --> 00:27:51,571
You just fooling everybody.

356
00:27:52,144 --> 00:27:55,170
<i>What's the matter?
Did you get Madjembe?</i>

357
00:27:55,281 --> 00:27:56,646
<i>What's Madjembe?</i>

358
00:27:56,749 --> 00:27:58,046
Worms.

359
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:00,714
I don't think I have worms.

360
00:28:01,387 --> 00:28:02,911
This is just how I am.

361
00:28:03,022 --> 00:28:05,889
- Did you take your pills today?
- No, ma'am.

362
00:28:05,991 --> 00:28:08,323
Come. Let's get a cold root beer.

363
00:28:08,427 --> 00:28:10,554
I found the medication
under your pillow.

364
00:28:10,663 --> 00:28:13,826
I'm not supposed to. It's dangerous.

365
00:28:13,933 --> 00:28:16,663
Who said that? Come on, little man.

366
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,631
Hello, children.

367
00:28:30,883 --> 00:28:32,373
Hold, please.

368
00:28:35,054 --> 00:28:39,354
Then I'm in the monkey house
at Philadelphia Zoological Park.

369
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:43,751
Three thousand people
show up my first day.

370
00:28:45,097 --> 00:28:46,086
Look.

371
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,800
What's it like living in a cage?

372
00:28:49,902 --> 00:28:51,369
It stinks.

373
00:28:52,004 --> 00:28:54,268
But the monkeys.

374
00:28:55,074 --> 00:28:57,099
They do some tricks there.

375
00:28:57,343 --> 00:29:00,039
I throw a spear, wrestle with Kowali.

376
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,609
She is orangutan.

377
00:29:03,048 --> 00:29:06,575
When I'm not playing with the monkeys,
they want me to run to the bars

378
00:29:06,685 --> 00:29:08,778
in my cage, with my teeth.

379
00:29:18,731 --> 00:29:20,790
So then what'd you do?

380
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:26,736
Then I leave zoo, go here, go there.
Wandered most of the time.

381
00:29:27,206 --> 00:29:28,230
You were all alone?

382
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,638
Plenty of time you'll be alone.

383
00:29:30,743 --> 00:29:34,179
When you're different like us,
it's gonna be that way.

384
00:29:37,216 --> 00:29:39,047
But I'll tell you a little secret.

385
00:29:39,151 --> 00:29:42,450
Fat people, skinny people, tall people,

386
00:29:42,554 --> 00:29:45,546
white people,
they're just as alone as we are.

387
00:29:46,091 --> 00:29:48,286
But they're scared shitless.

388
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,128
I think about the river I grew up on.

389
00:29:57,603 --> 00:30:00,504
It would be nice to sit by my river again.

390
00:30:02,775 --> 00:30:05,141
Come, I have an appointment.

391
00:30:07,546 --> 00:30:10,106
There's my little man.
You ready, sugar?

392
00:30:10,215 --> 00:30:12,547
Always ready. Always ready.

393
00:30:14,353 --> 00:30:16,446
Filamena, Mr. Benjamin.

394
00:30:17,489 --> 00:30:20,549
- It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
- My pleasure, ma'am.

395
00:30:20,659 --> 00:30:22,627
You can find your own way home,
can't you?

396
00:30:22,728 --> 00:30:25,458
Take the St. Charles line to Napoleon.

397
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,062
Hey! Hey!

398
00:30:53,392 --> 00:30:56,884
Where in God's name have you been?
Get in here.

399
00:30:58,397 --> 00:31:01,662
I mean, you take my breath away,
you know that?

400
00:31:02,067 --> 00:31:04,661
Oh, Lord, I was so worried about you.

401
00:31:08,374 --> 00:31:10,934
<i>It had been the best day of my life.</i>

402
00:31:11,877 --> 00:31:14,573
- How's her breathing?
- It's shallow.

403
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,204
They say it'll reach us in a few hours,

404
00:31:16,315 --> 00:31:19,216
so I gotta get my baby
and take him to my sister's.

405
00:31:19,318 --> 00:31:21,786
They say there's nothing to worry about
here in the hospital.

406
00:31:21,887 --> 00:31:24,378
Nurses'll be right here if you need them.
Are you okay?

407
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:28,221
- Yeah, I'm okay reading.
- I shouldn't be more than an hour.

408
00:31:29,628 --> 00:31:32,256
Was there just company?

409
00:31:32,831 --> 00:31:35,231
It was just Dorothy leaving.

410
00:31:37,403 --> 00:31:38,836
Go on, Caroline.

411
00:31:38,937 --> 00:31:42,031
"On Sundays, the families would come
and visit. "

412
00:31:42,441 --> 00:31:45,376
<i>It was Thanksgiving, 1930.</i>

413
00:31:45,477 --> 00:31:48,446
<i>I met the person
who changed my life forever.</i>

414
00:32:00,526 --> 00:32:02,585
Well, Benjamin.

415
00:32:03,028 --> 00:32:06,327
Might I say you are looking
strikingly youthful.

416
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,357
Good day, Mrs. Fuller.

417
00:32:08,467 --> 00:32:11,732
A single cane,
back straight as an arrow.

418
00:32:11,837 --> 00:32:14,203
What elixir have you been drinking?

419
00:32:14,306 --> 00:32:17,673
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Grandma! Look at me!

420
00:32:20,112 --> 00:32:22,444
That was really something.

421
00:32:22,548 --> 00:32:24,413
Come on over here, you.

422
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:27,348
Now, this is my granddaughter, Daisy.

423
00:32:28,287 --> 00:32:30,118
This is Mr...

424
00:32:30,255 --> 00:32:33,918
I'm afraid, Benjamin,
I don't rightly know your last name.

425
00:32:34,026 --> 00:32:35,653
Benjamin's fine.

426
00:32:36,295 --> 00:32:38,627
<i>I never forgot her blue eyes.</i>

427
00:32:39,064 --> 00:32:41,726
Good people, supper is served.

428
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:47,932
Health and food, for love and friends.
For everything thy goodness sends.

429
00:32:48,373 --> 00:32:49,533
Amen.

430
00:32:49,641 --> 00:32:50,869
- Amen!
- Amen!

431
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:57,140
Did you know turkeys aren't really birds?

432
00:32:57,249 --> 00:32:58,273
Why do you say that?

433
00:32:58,383 --> 00:33:01,511
They're in the pheasant family,
can't hardly fly.

434
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,145
It's sad, don't you think?
Birds that can't fly?

435
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:06,417
I love birds that can't fly.

436
00:33:06,525 --> 00:33:08,516
They are so delicious.

437
00:33:09,695 --> 00:33:12,163
- That's terrible.
- I have something to tell y'all

438
00:33:12,264 --> 00:33:15,427
while we're giving thanks
for God's blessings.

439
00:33:15,534 --> 00:33:17,468
I had a miracle happen.

440
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:20,598
The Lord saw fit to answer my prayers.

441
00:33:24,309 --> 00:33:26,607
What does she mean,
answered her prayers?

442
00:33:26,712 --> 00:33:28,236
Thanks. Thank you.

443
00:33:28,347 --> 00:33:30,713
She's gonna have a baby, silly.

444
00:33:31,683 --> 00:33:34,675
That's what my mama said
when I was gonna have a baby brother,

445
00:33:34,786 --> 00:33:37,050
but he didn't live long,

446
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:40,622
'cause he didn't breathe right.

447
00:33:43,495 --> 00:33:47,488
"In the afternoon, when he had got
his beautiful hind legs

448
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:51,194
"just as Big God Nqong had promised.

449
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:54,265
"You can see that it is 5:00,

450
00:33:54,373 --> 00:33:58,332
"because Big God Nqong's
clock says so. "

451
00:33:58,443 --> 00:34:00,274
Isn't that something?

452
00:34:00,846 --> 00:34:02,211
Again, read it again.

453
00:34:02,314 --> 00:34:04,612
Oh, read it again, please.

454
00:34:04,716 --> 00:34:08,015
All right.
But afterwards, you must go to bed.

455
00:34:08,387 --> 00:34:09,786
I promise.

456
00:34:11,757 --> 00:34:13,588
"Old Man Kangaroo. "

457
00:34:17,896 --> 00:34:19,557
Are you sleeping?

458
00:34:21,099 --> 00:34:22,589
Who's that?

459
00:34:22,701 --> 00:34:24,259
It's me, Daisy.

460
00:34:25,304 --> 00:34:26,771
Oh, hi!

461
00:34:27,372 --> 00:34:28,862
'Kay, come on.

462
00:34:40,018 --> 00:34:41,747
Where are we going?

463
00:34:42,921 --> 00:34:45,719
Come on. Under here.

464
00:34:55,267 --> 00:34:56,700
Here, you light it.

465
00:34:56,802 --> 00:34:58,895
I'm not supposed to play with matches.

466
00:34:59,004 --> 00:35:01,268
Don't be a chicken. Light it.

467
00:35:12,384 --> 00:35:15,319
I'll tell you a secret if you'll tell me one.

468
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,853
Okay.

469
00:35:16,955 --> 00:35:20,288
I saw my mama kissing another man.

470
00:35:20,692 --> 00:35:22,751
Her face was red from it.

471
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,520
Your turn.

472
00:35:29,835 --> 00:35:32,133
I'm not as old as I look.

473
00:35:32,237 --> 00:35:33,795
I thought so.

474
00:35:35,774 --> 00:35:38,208
You don't seem like an old person.

475
00:35:38,877 --> 00:35:41,038
- Like my grandma.
- I'm not.

476
00:35:42,814 --> 00:35:44,406
Are you sick?

477
00:35:44,983 --> 00:35:48,146
Well, I heard Mama
and Tizzy whispering.

478
00:35:48,253 --> 00:35:52,417
They said I was gonna die soon,
but maybe not.

479
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,184
You're odd.

480
00:35:56,962 --> 00:35:59,829
You're different
than anybody I've ever met.

481
00:36:03,001 --> 00:36:05,162
- May I?
- Okay.

482
00:36:12,411 --> 00:36:14,845
What are you doing under there?

483
00:36:14,946 --> 00:36:18,382
You come right out here
and get back up to bed!

484
00:36:18,483 --> 00:36:20,246
It's after midnight!

485
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:22,445
You are not to be playing together.

486
00:36:22,554 --> 00:36:24,078
Yes, ma'am.

487
00:36:24,189 --> 00:36:26,350
Now you get back to bed, little lady.

488
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:30,417
You're too young to be wandering
around in the night on your own.

489
00:36:33,098 --> 00:36:36,932
And you ought
to be ashamed of yourself.

490
00:36:52,217 --> 00:36:54,276
You are a different child.

491
00:36:55,053 --> 00:36:56,145
A man-child.

492
00:36:56,254 --> 00:37:00,714
And, baby, people aren't gonna
understand just how different you are.

493
00:37:07,032 --> 00:37:09,193
What's wrong with me, Mama?

494
00:37:10,135 --> 00:37:11,898
Come here.

495
00:37:14,072 --> 00:37:16,302
God hasn't said yet, baby.

496
00:37:20,746 --> 00:37:24,238
Now go on to bed, hear?
And behave yourself.

497
00:37:25,584 --> 00:37:28,144
Go on. Say your prayers, hear?

498
00:37:39,965 --> 00:37:44,026
Did I ever tell you I've been struck
by lightning seven times?

499
00:37:46,371 --> 00:37:49,272
Once when I was repairing
a leak on the roof.

500
00:37:53,378 --> 00:37:56,609
Once I was just crossing
the road to get the mail.

501
00:38:12,664 --> 00:38:13,961
<i>I never forgot her...</i>

502
00:38:14,065 --> 00:38:15,555
"... blue eyes. "

503
00:38:17,035 --> 00:38:18,593
Mom?

504
00:38:18,703 --> 00:38:23,470
Did you get that this Benjamin loved you
from the first time that he saw you?

505
00:38:24,743 --> 00:38:27,177
Not many people experience that.

506
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,443
Want me to go on?

507
00:38:32,451 --> 00:38:34,442
He crosses something out.

508
00:38:34,553 --> 00:38:37,852
<i>When that baby came,
things were different.</i>

509
00:38:37,956 --> 00:38:41,289
<i>Your mama gone away
And your daddy gonna stay</i>

510
00:38:41,393 --> 00:38:45,193
<i>Didn't leave nobody but the baby</i>

511
00:38:46,665 --> 00:38:49,259
<i>Babies were born, people died.</i>

512
00:38:50,168 --> 00:38:53,001
<i>A lot of folks been through
that old house.</i>

513
00:38:54,973 --> 00:38:58,204
I've come to say goodbye.
I'm going away.

514
00:38:58,310 --> 00:38:59,572
Going?

515
00:39:00,078 --> 00:39:01,602
Where?

516
00:39:01,713 --> 00:39:03,271
I haven't figured that out yet,

517
00:39:03,381 --> 00:39:05,849
but I'll send you a postcard
when I get there.

518
00:39:05,951 --> 00:39:08,715
What about your friend, the tall lady?

519
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,219
We are not friends anymore.

520
00:39:10,322 --> 00:39:13,587
That's what happens
with tall people sometimes.

521
00:39:13,692 --> 00:39:16,456
Well, goodbye.

522
00:39:35,747 --> 00:39:38,511
<i>Spent a lot of time by myself that year.</i>

523
00:39:39,885 --> 00:39:41,113
Hello?

524
00:39:42,888 --> 00:39:44,651
- Hi.
- I'm moving in today.

525
00:39:44,756 --> 00:39:47,589
Welcome. We've been expecting you.

526
00:39:47,692 --> 00:39:50,718
Can you please show her up
to Mrs. Rousseau's old room?

527
00:39:50,829 --> 00:39:54,162
I'm sorry, but we usually
don't allow dogs in the house.

528
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:57,258
Well, she's old as the hills.
She's almost blind.

529
00:39:57,369 --> 00:40:00,304
She won't be a bother much longer.

530
00:40:00,405 --> 00:40:04,102
Well, all right,
long as she stays from up underfoot.

531
00:40:04,209 --> 00:40:05,403
Right this way, ma'am.

532
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:08,638
<i>As hard as I try,
I can't remember her name.</i>

533
00:40:08,747 --> 00:40:11,875
<i>Mrs. Lawson, or Mrs. Hartford.</i>

534
00:40:12,918 --> 00:40:14,681
<i>Maybe it was Maple.</i>

535
00:40:14,786 --> 00:40:17,118
<i>It's funny how sometimes
the people we remember the least</i>

536
00:40:17,222 --> 00:40:19,747
<i>make the greatest impression on us.</i>

537
00:40:20,358 --> 00:40:22,690
<i>I do remember she wore diamonds.</i>

538
00:40:22,794 --> 00:40:26,594
<i>And she always dressed in fine
clothing, as if she was going out.</i>

539
00:40:26,698 --> 00:40:30,259
<i>Although she never did
and nobody ever came to visit her.</i>

540
00:40:32,003 --> 00:40:34,335
<i>She taught me to play the piano.</i>

541
00:40:39,711 --> 00:40:42,339
It's not about how well you play.

542
00:40:43,081 --> 00:40:45,914
It's how you feel
about what you're playing.

543
00:40:46,017 --> 00:40:47,348
Try this.

544
00:41:03,702 --> 00:41:06,933
You can't help putting yourself
in the music.

545
00:41:15,013 --> 00:41:17,004
<i>There were many changes.</i>

546
00:41:17,115 --> 00:41:20,175
<i>Some you could see,
some you couldn't.</i>

547
00:41:21,319 --> 00:41:24,152
<i>Hair had started growing
in all sorts of places,</i>

548
00:41:24,689 --> 00:41:26,657
<i>along with other things.</i>

549
00:41:27,959 --> 00:41:30,689
<i>I felt pretty good, considering.</i>

550
00:41:31,763 --> 00:41:34,425
Darling, the pain.

551
00:41:34,532 --> 00:41:37,057
All right, Mom, I'll get the nurse.

552
00:41:39,604 --> 00:41:42,266
<i>Look at this eye.
This is a major hurricane,</i>

553
00:41:42,841 --> 00:41:45,366
<i>a slow hurricane,
with maximum sustained winds of...</i>

554
00:41:45,477 --> 00:41:47,308
Not doing too good?

555
00:41:48,179 --> 00:41:51,444
Nobody seems to know
whether to stay or leave.

556
00:41:51,549 --> 00:41:53,847
I'm gonna ride it out.

557
00:41:53,952 --> 00:41:56,819
There.
That should make things much easier.

558
00:42:00,258 --> 00:42:03,455
Have you had a chance
to say your goodbyes?

559
00:42:03,561 --> 00:42:07,053
My father waited four hours for
my brother to get here from Boger City.

560
00:42:07,165 --> 00:42:09,133
Couldn't go without him.

561
00:42:09,668 --> 00:42:12,330
- She seems like a sweet woman.
- Yeah.

562
00:42:13,004 --> 00:42:14,699
I haven't had as much time with her
as I would've...

563
00:42:14,806 --> 00:42:16,706
- You busy? I could use your help.
- Excuse me.

564
00:42:16,808 --> 00:42:18,036
Sure.

565
00:42:36,227 --> 00:42:38,252
"Queenie would let me go
with Mr. Daws... "

566
00:42:38,363 --> 00:42:42,163
<i>...to Poverty Point to watch the boats
go up and down the river.</i>

567
00:42:42,267 --> 00:42:44,201
<i>These were hard times.</i>

568
00:42:47,238 --> 00:42:50,935
Did I ever tell you I was struck
by lightning seven times?

569
00:42:51,876 --> 00:42:55,277
Once when I was in the field,
just tending to my cows.

570
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:04,084
My fourth hand didn't show up.

571
00:43:06,324 --> 00:43:09,782
Anybody want to make $2
for a day's work 'round here?

572
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:13,425
What's the matter?

573
00:43:13,531 --> 00:43:16,261
Nobody wants to do an honest
day's work for an honest day's pay?

574
00:43:16,401 --> 00:43:17,925
He never pays.

575
00:43:19,404 --> 00:43:21,702
- Nobody wants a job?
- I do.

576
00:43:23,341 --> 00:43:26,174
You got your sea legs about you,
old man?

577
00:43:27,278 --> 00:43:28,643
I think.

578
00:43:32,617 --> 00:43:35,051
Well, that's good enough for me.

579
00:43:35,153 --> 00:43:38,611
Get your ass on board.
We'll sure as hell find out.

580
00:43:44,129 --> 00:43:45,756
<i>I was as happy as I could be.</i>

581
00:43:45,864 --> 00:43:47,126
I need a volunteer!

582
00:43:47,232 --> 00:43:48,563
<i>I would do anything.</i>

583
00:43:48,666 --> 00:43:50,099
Yes, Captain!

584
00:43:50,201 --> 00:43:52,499
Scrape off all this bird shit!

585
00:43:53,238 --> 00:43:54,933
Right away, sir.

586
00:43:55,774 --> 00:44:00,234
<i>And I was actually gonna be paid
for something I would've done for free.</i>

587
00:44:01,913 --> 00:44:04,245
<i>His name was Captain Mike Clark.</i>

588
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:08,151
<i>He'd been on a tugboat
since he was seven.</i>

589
00:44:09,187 --> 00:44:10,916
Get moving, then.

590
00:44:11,856 --> 00:44:13,346
Come here.

591
00:44:15,426 --> 00:44:18,520
Can you still get it up?

592
00:44:19,898 --> 00:44:21,889
I do every morning.

593
00:44:22,567 --> 00:44:25,968
The old pole, huh? The high, hard one?

594
00:44:26,604 --> 00:44:27,901
I guess.

595
00:44:30,508 --> 00:44:33,136
When was the last time
you had a woman?

596
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,580
- Never.
- Never?

597
00:44:38,082 --> 00:44:40,141
Not that I know of, sir.

598
00:44:40,652 --> 00:44:42,415
Wait a minute, now.

599
00:44:43,221 --> 00:44:47,351
You mean to say you've been
on this earth however many years

600
00:44:47,458 --> 00:44:50,723
and you've never had a woman?

601
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,460
Damn, that's the saddest thing
I've ever heard in my life.

602
00:44:59,938 --> 00:45:01,166
Never?

603
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:03,032
No.

604
00:45:05,677 --> 00:45:09,773
Well, then, by Jesus,
you are coming with me.

605
00:45:20,792 --> 00:45:22,384
What did your father do?

606
00:45:22,493 --> 00:45:24,518
I never met my father.

607
00:45:24,629 --> 00:45:26,563
You lucky bastard.

608
00:45:27,465 --> 00:45:30,093
All fathers want to do is hold you down.

609
00:45:32,737 --> 00:45:36,138
Out on my father's boat,
workin' the two-a-day,

610
00:45:36,474 --> 00:45:38,908
this little, fat bastard.

611
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:40,705
"Tug Irish," they called him.

612
00:45:40,812 --> 00:45:44,179
Anyway, I finally work up the nerve
and tell him,

613
00:45:45,083 --> 00:45:48,780
"I don't want to spend the rest of my life
on a goddamn tugboat. "

614
00:45:48,887 --> 00:45:50,855
You know what I'm saying?

615
00:45:51,256 --> 00:45:53,918
You don't want to spend
the rest of your life on a tugboat.

616
00:45:54,025 --> 00:45:56,323
Absolutely! Damn right!

617
00:45:59,097 --> 00:46:01,691
So you know
what my father says to me?

618
00:46:02,533 --> 00:46:06,970
He says,
"Who the hell do you think you are?

619
00:46:07,071 --> 00:46:09,801
"What the hell do you think you can do?"

620
00:46:10,108 --> 00:46:11,769
So I tell him.

621
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:15,607
"Well, if you're asking,

622
00:46:17,882 --> 00:46:19,907
"I want to be an artist. "

623
00:46:20,485 --> 00:46:22,385
He laughs.

624
00:46:22,887 --> 00:46:27,881
"An artist? God meant for you
to work a tugboat, just like me.

625
00:46:27,992 --> 00:46:30,620
"And that's exactly
what you're gonna do. "

626
00:46:30,728 --> 00:46:33,959
Well, I turned myself into an artist.

627
00:46:36,434 --> 00:46:38,163
A tattoo artist!

628
00:46:40,605 --> 00:46:43,403
I put on every one of these myself.

629
00:46:45,944 --> 00:46:49,744
You have to skin me alive
to take my art away from me now.

630
00:46:50,548 --> 00:46:54,040
When I'm dead,
I'm gonna send him my arm.

631
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,719
That one.

632
00:46:59,057 --> 00:47:01,685
Don't let anyone tell you different.

633
00:47:01,793 --> 00:47:04,387
You gotta do what you're meant to do.

634
00:47:04,495 --> 00:47:07,589
And I happen to be a goddamned artist.

635
00:47:08,199 --> 00:47:10,497
But you're a tugboat captain.

636
00:47:11,102 --> 00:47:12,831
Captain Mike?

637
00:47:12,937 --> 00:47:15,667
We're ready for you and your friend.

638
00:47:17,408 --> 00:47:20,434
Let's go, old timer, eh?
Break your cherry.

639
00:47:21,646 --> 00:47:24,342
- Hello, my lovelies!
- Hey, Captain.

640
00:47:24,482 --> 00:47:25,449
- Hi, Captain.
- Hi.

641
00:47:27,618 --> 00:47:28,710
- Hi.
- Hi.

642
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:31,846
He gives me the willies.
That is not for me.

643
00:47:33,791 --> 00:47:36,055
How are you tonight, grandpa?

644
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:38,855
<i>It was a night to remember.</i>

645
00:47:44,602 --> 00:47:48,265
What are you, Dick Tracy or something?
I've got to rest.

646
00:47:49,407 --> 00:47:50,635
Again.

647
00:47:51,943 --> 00:47:54,275
- Thank you.
- No, thank you. You have a nice night.

648
00:47:54,379 --> 00:47:56,506
- Will you be here tomorrow?
- Every night but Sunday.

649
00:47:56,614 --> 00:48:00,311
<i>It sure made me understand
the value of earning a living.</i>

650
00:48:00,952 --> 00:48:02,783
Good night, sweetie. Come back now.

651
00:48:02,887 --> 00:48:05,082
<i>Things money can buy you.</i>

652
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:24,435
It's nasty out.

653
00:48:24,909 --> 00:48:27,810
Can I offer you a ride somewhere?

654
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:31,844
Well, that's awfully kind of you, sir.

655
00:48:41,192 --> 00:48:43,660
My name is Thomas, Thomas Button.

656
00:48:44,328 --> 00:48:46,421
- I'm Benjamin.
- Benjamin.

657
00:48:47,698 --> 00:48:49,825
It's a pleasure to know you.

658
00:48:51,369 --> 00:48:54,600
Would you like to stop somewhere
and have a drink?

659
00:48:54,705 --> 00:48:56,070
All right.

660
00:48:57,375 --> 00:48:59,639
Evening, Mr. Button.

661
00:49:04,215 --> 00:49:06,149
What'll it be, sir?

662
00:49:06,884 --> 00:49:09,910
- I'll have whatever he's having.
- Sazerac for the both of us.

663
00:49:10,021 --> 00:49:12,387
With whiskey, not brandy.

664
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:13,980
You don't drink, do you?

665
00:49:14,092 --> 00:49:16,686
- It's a night for firsts.
- How's that?

666
00:49:16,794 --> 00:49:18,853
I've never been to a brothel, either.

667
00:49:18,963 --> 00:49:21,727
Well, it's an experience.

668
00:49:21,866 --> 00:49:24,960
It certainly is.
There's a time for everything.

669
00:49:25,069 --> 00:49:27,469
- True enough.
- Your drinks.

670
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:34,339
I don't mean to be rude, but your hands.
Is that painful?

671
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:37,307
Well, I was born
with some form of disease.

672
00:49:37,415 --> 00:49:38,973
What kind of disease?

673
00:49:39,083 --> 00:49:40,812
I was born old.

674
00:49:42,353 --> 00:49:44,048
- I'm sorry.
- No need to be.

675
00:49:44,155 --> 00:49:46,680
There's nothing wrong with old age.

676
00:49:55,566 --> 00:49:58,592
My wife passed away many years ago.

677
00:50:00,004 --> 00:50:01,835
I'm so, so sorry.

678
00:50:03,307 --> 00:50:05,172
She died in childbirth.

679
00:50:08,679 --> 00:50:11,204
- To children.
- To mothers.

680
00:50:16,053 --> 00:50:18,317
What line of work you in, Mr. Button?

681
00:50:18,422 --> 00:50:22,552
Buttons. Button's Buttons.
There isn't a button that we don't make.

682
00:50:24,762 --> 00:50:27,128
Our biggest competition
is B.F. Goodrich

683
00:50:27,231 --> 00:50:28,960
and his infernal zippers.

684
00:50:29,066 --> 00:50:31,864
Would you gentlemen like
anything else?

685
00:50:31,969 --> 00:50:33,994
One for the road, Benjamin?

686
00:50:34,105 --> 00:50:36,938
Only if you let me pay for it, Mr. Button.

687
00:50:38,209 --> 00:50:40,677
So, what line of work do you do?

688
00:50:42,113 --> 00:50:44,547
I'm a tugboat man.

689
00:50:50,755 --> 00:50:52,780
I enjoyed talking to you.

690
00:50:53,257 --> 00:50:55,384
I enjoyed drinking with you.

691
00:50:58,996 --> 00:51:00,395
Benjamin?

692
00:51:00,498 --> 00:51:03,934
Would you mind if, time to time,
I stopped by and said hello?

693
00:51:04,035 --> 00:51:07,436
Anytime. Good night, Mr. Button.

694
00:51:07,972 --> 00:51:09,735
Good night, Benjamin.

695
00:51:10,474 --> 00:51:11,839
Drive on.

696
00:51:17,515 --> 00:51:18,846
Where have you been?

697
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:23,944
Nothing. I met some people
and listened to some music.

698
00:51:26,724 --> 00:51:28,919
Oh, sweet Jesus, boy!

699
00:51:29,927 --> 00:51:33,021
<i>Growing up's a funny thing.
Sneaks up on you.</i>

700
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:38,299
<i>One person is there, then suddenly
somebody else has taken her place.</i>

701
00:51:38,903 --> 00:51:40,564
<i>She wasn't all elbows
and knees anymore.</i>

702
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:42,366
Benjamin! Come on!

703
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:44,105
Okay.

704
00:51:45,376 --> 00:51:46,934
<i>I loved those weekends
when she'd come</i>

705
00:51:47,044 --> 00:51:49,842
<i>and spend the night
with her grandmother.</i>

706
00:51:57,922 --> 00:52:00,390
Daisy. Daisy.

707
00:52:01,592 --> 00:52:03,719
You want to see something?

708
00:52:04,895 --> 00:52:09,662
You gotta keep it a secret,
so get dressed. I'll meet you out back.

709
00:52:15,206 --> 00:52:16,571
Come on.

710
00:52:18,376 --> 00:52:21,504
- Can you swim?
- I can do anything you can do.

711
00:52:21,612 --> 00:52:24,206
Here, put this on. We gotta hurry.

712
00:52:37,161 --> 00:52:38,685
Is he okay?

713
00:52:38,796 --> 00:52:40,229
Captain?

714
00:52:41,866 --> 00:52:43,356
Captain Mike?

715
00:52:47,104 --> 00:52:49,800
Morning, Captain. Can you take us out?

716
00:52:50,975 --> 00:52:53,273
Do you know what day it is?

717
00:52:53,377 --> 00:52:54,639
Sunday?

718
00:52:54,745 --> 00:52:56,872
Do you know what that means?

719
00:52:58,215 --> 00:53:00,615
Means I was very drunk last night.

720
00:53:01,218 --> 00:53:03,482
Well, you're drunk every night.

721
00:53:05,956 --> 00:53:08,220
- Is that a girl?
- Close friend.

722
00:53:08,959 --> 00:53:10,051
I want to show her the river.

723
00:53:10,161 --> 00:53:13,460
You're not supposed to go joyriding
with civilians.

724
00:53:14,632 --> 00:53:16,759
I could lose my license.

725
00:53:26,577 --> 00:53:28,044
What are you waiting for?

726
00:53:58,242 --> 00:54:01,336
Pulled in for repair a wounded duck.

727
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:04,907
She's flying now, huh?

728
00:54:05,449 --> 00:54:07,076
Ahoy, sailor!

729
00:54:11,655 --> 00:54:13,987
I wish we could go with them.

730
00:54:19,997 --> 00:54:22,261
Did you say something, Mom?

731
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:32,008
It's getting really bad.

732
00:54:34,044 --> 00:54:35,807
Can you hear me, Mom?

733
00:54:38,449 --> 00:54:41,111
Time just seeped out of me.

734
00:54:47,892 --> 00:54:49,689
"Things were changing quickly. "

735
00:54:49,794 --> 00:54:53,890
I don't know how it's possible,
but you seem to have more hair.

736
00:54:55,433 --> 00:54:58,402
What if I told you
that I wasn't getting older,

737
00:54:58,502 --> 00:55:01,801
but I was getting younger
than everybody else?

738
00:55:01,906 --> 00:55:05,808
Well, I'd feel sorry for you,

739
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:08,743
to have to see everybody you love
die before you do.

740
00:55:08,846 --> 00:55:10,746
It's an awful responsibility.

741
00:55:10,848 --> 00:55:14,409
<i>I'd never thought about life or death
that way before.</i>

742
00:55:16,053 --> 00:55:20,114
Benjamin, we're meant
to lose the people we love.

743
00:55:20,591 --> 00:55:23,958
How else would we know
how important they are to us?

744
00:55:27,064 --> 00:55:31,524
<i>And one fall day, a familiar visitor
came knocking on our door.</i>

745
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:36,068
You want to go with me
to the drugstore?

746
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:48,583
<i>She taught me how to play the piano.</i>

747
00:55:48,686 --> 00:55:49,948
- Amen.
- Amen.

748
00:55:50,054 --> 00:55:53,217
<i>And she taught me
what it meant to miss somebody.</i>

749
00:55:57,795 --> 00:55:59,228
Let's go.

750
00:56:00,264 --> 00:56:02,198
<i>I had gone to a brothel.</i>

751
00:56:02,299 --> 00:56:04,597
<i>I'd had my first drink.</i>

752
00:56:04,702 --> 00:56:08,160
<i>Said goodbye to one friend
and buried another.</i>

753
00:56:08,706 --> 00:56:13,575
<i>In 1936, when I was coming to the end
of the 17th year of my life,</i>

754
00:56:13,677 --> 00:56:16,510
<i>I packed my bag, said goodbye.</i>

755
00:56:16,614 --> 00:56:18,946
- Bye, Benjamin.
- Goodbye.

756
00:56:19,049 --> 00:56:23,509
<i>I knew, life being what it was,
I'd probably never see them again.</i>

757
00:56:25,723 --> 00:56:27,350
Bye, Mr. Benjamin.

758
00:56:27,458 --> 00:56:29,926
- Good luck to you, son.
- Thank you.

759
00:56:34,465 --> 00:56:37,366
- I love you, Mama.
- I love you, too, baby.

760
00:56:38,569 --> 00:56:41,800
I want you to say your prayers
every night, hear?

761
00:56:46,677 --> 00:56:48,702
Be safe, hear?

762
00:57:00,124 --> 00:57:01,489
Benjamin!

763
00:57:04,595 --> 00:57:07,223
- Where you going?
- To sea.

764
00:57:08,632 --> 00:57:10,691
I'll send you a postcard.

765
00:57:12,536 --> 00:57:14,470
From everywhere.

766
00:57:14,572 --> 00:57:17,166
Write me a postcard from everywhere.

767
00:57:31,689 --> 00:57:33,554
Can you imagine?

768
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:42,058
He sent me a postcard
from everywhere he went.

769
00:57:43,634 --> 00:57:45,602
Every place he worked.

770
00:57:46,937 --> 00:57:49,997
Newfoundland. Baffin Bay.

771
00:57:50,608 --> 00:57:53,668
Glasgow. Liverpool. Narvik.

772
00:57:54,478 --> 00:57:59,211
He had gone with that Captain Mike.

773
00:58:01,251 --> 00:58:03,481
<i>Captain Mike had contracted
for three years</i>

774
00:58:03,587 --> 00:58:05,885
<i>with Moran Brothers Tug and Salvage.</i>

775
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:09,858
<i>The old ship had been refitted with
a diesel engine and a new sea winch.</i>

776
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,861
<i>We went around Florida
and up the Atlantic seaboard.</i>

777
00:58:12,963 --> 00:58:16,364
<i>We were a crew of seven now.
Captain Mike and me.</i>

778
00:58:16,467 --> 00:58:19,800
<i>Cookie, Prentiss Mayes
from Wilmington, Delaware.</i>

779
00:58:19,903 --> 00:58:22,303
<i>The Brody twins, Rick and Vic,</i>

780
00:58:22,406 --> 00:58:24,636
<i>who got along fine at sea
but, for some reason,</i>

781
00:58:24,742 --> 00:58:27,802
<i>once they were on dry land
couldn't stand the sight of each other.</i>

782
00:58:27,911 --> 00:58:31,472
You know, one in every
eight boats never returns.

783
00:58:31,582 --> 00:58:33,709
<i>There was John Grimm,
who sure fit his name.</i>

784
00:58:33,817 --> 00:58:35,648
All hands lost at sea.

785
00:58:35,753 --> 00:58:37,983
<i>From Belvedere, South Dakota.</i>

786
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:42,223
<i>And Pleasant Curtis
from Asheville, Notch.</i>

787
00:58:42,326 --> 00:58:45,489
<i>Never said a word to anyone,
except himself.</i>

788
00:58:47,598 --> 00:58:49,045
I wrote him constantly.

789
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,492
I wrote him constantly.

790
00:58:52,136 --> 00:58:57,130
<i>I told him I had been invited to
audition in New York City</i>

791
00:58:57,708 --> 00:59:00,370
<i>for the School of American Ballet.</i>

792
00:59:00,477 --> 00:59:01,876
Please stay.

793
00:59:01,979 --> 00:59:04,106
Thank you. Thank you.

794
00:59:06,083 --> 00:59:07,345
You can stay.

795
00:59:09,853 --> 00:59:12,913
<i>But I was relegated to the corps.</i>

796
00:59:13,257 --> 00:59:15,623
<i>Another dancing gypsy.</i>

797
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:21,454
Benjamin!

798
00:59:22,099 --> 00:59:24,567
How is it when you showed up

799
00:59:24,668 --> 00:59:28,536
you were no bigger than a bollard
with one foot in the grave,

800
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:32,837
but now, either I drink a hell
of a lot more than I think I do,

801
00:59:34,111 --> 00:59:35,738
or you sprouted?

802
00:59:36,647 --> 00:59:38,410
What's your secret?

803
00:59:39,850 --> 00:59:41,408
Well, Captain,

804
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:45,017
you do drink a lot.

805
00:59:49,827 --> 00:59:54,093
<i>We stayed in a small hotel
with a grand name, The Winter Palace.</i>

806
00:59:54,198 --> 00:59:56,962
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

807
00:59:57,067 --> 01:00:00,525
The hummingbird
is not just another bird.

808
01:00:01,271 --> 01:00:04,968
Its heart rate's 1,200 beats per minute.

809
01:00:06,744 --> 01:00:09,440
Its wings beat 80 times a second.

810
01:00:11,381 --> 01:00:14,373
If you was to stop their wings
from beating,

811
01:00:15,018 --> 01:00:17,851
it would be dead
in less than 10 seconds.

812
01:00:18,856 --> 01:00:21,518
This is no ordinary bird.

813
01:00:22,192 --> 01:00:24,285
This is a frickin' miracle.

814
01:00:27,464 --> 01:00:31,366
They slowed down their wings
with moving pictures,

815
01:00:32,035 --> 01:00:34,230
and you know what they saw?

816
01:00:34,738 --> 01:00:37,536
Their wingtips are doing that.

817
01:00:41,578 --> 01:00:45,412
You know what the figure eight
is the mathematical symbol for?

818
01:00:48,418 --> 01:00:49,942
Infinity.

819
01:00:50,053 --> 01:00:51,384
Infinity!

820
01:00:54,892 --> 01:00:57,793
<i>Everybody, no matter
what differences they had,</i>

821
01:00:57,895 --> 01:01:01,922
<i>the languages, the color of their skin,
had one thing in common.</i>

822
01:01:02,866 --> 01:01:05,232
<i>They were drunk every single night.</i>

823
01:01:05,335 --> 01:01:06,859
Three, please.

824
01:01:06,970 --> 01:01:08,562
Could you hold, dear, for us, please?

825
01:01:08,672 --> 01:01:10,936
Thank you very much. Good evening.

826
01:01:11,041 --> 01:01:13,737
<i>Her name was Elizabeth Abbott.</i>

827
01:01:13,844 --> 01:01:17,143
<i>She was not beautiful.
She was plain as paper.</i>

828
01:01:17,247 --> 01:01:20,045
<i>But she was pretty as any picture to me.</i>

829
01:01:21,351 --> 01:01:23,376
What are you looking at?

830
01:01:25,622 --> 01:01:28,147
If you must know,
we have a longstanding agreement

831
01:01:28,258 --> 01:01:29,623
never to go to bed sober.

832
01:01:29,726 --> 01:01:32,126
- Isn't that right, darling?
- Whatever you say, darling.

833
01:01:32,229 --> 01:01:34,288
<i>Her husband was Walter Abbott.</i>

834
01:01:34,398 --> 01:01:38,300
<i>He was Chief Minister of
the British Trade Mission in Murmansk,</i>

835
01:01:38,402 --> 01:01:40,029
<i>and he was a spy.</i>

836
01:01:40,137 --> 01:01:43,004
- Darling.
- Oh, thank you, my darling.

837
01:01:43,106 --> 01:01:45,131
- Key, darling.
- Oh, yes.

838
01:01:49,646 --> 01:01:52,672
I broke my heel off one of my shoes.

839
01:01:52,783 --> 01:01:56,378
I'm not in the habit of walking about
in my stocking feet.

840
01:02:00,791 --> 01:02:02,952
<i>They were long days there.</i>

841
01:02:10,467 --> 01:02:12,435
<i>And even longer nights.</i>

842
01:02:14,638 --> 01:02:18,199
<i>One particular night,
I was having trouble sleeping.</i>

843
01:02:19,643 --> 01:02:21,167
I'm sorry.

844
01:02:23,046 --> 01:02:24,775
I couldn't sleep.

845
01:02:37,694 --> 01:02:41,152
I was gonna make some tea.
Would you like some?

846
01:02:42,065 --> 01:02:43,896
Oh, no. Thank you.

847
01:03:21,738 --> 01:03:23,296
Milk? Honey?

848
01:03:23,941 --> 01:03:25,875
A bit of honey, please.

849
01:03:26,410 --> 01:03:28,173
I hope you like flies in your honey.

850
01:03:28,278 --> 01:03:29,939
Oh, perhaps not.

851
01:03:44,795 --> 01:03:49,027
Oh, maybe better to let it steep a little.

852
01:03:50,033 --> 01:03:51,227
Steep?

853
01:03:51,601 --> 01:03:52,659
Soak.

854
01:03:52,936 --> 01:03:56,599
I don't know, I mean,
there's a proper way of making tea.

855
01:03:56,707 --> 01:03:59,938
Well, where I'm from,
people just want it to be hot.

856
01:04:00,043 --> 01:04:02,136
Well, quite right.

857
01:04:11,054 --> 01:04:13,454
- Now, you're a seaman.
- A sailor.

858
01:04:13,557 --> 01:04:16,287
I hope you won't think me impolite,
but I have to ask,

859
01:04:16,393 --> 01:04:18,520
aren't you a little old
to be working on a boat?

860
01:04:18,628 --> 01:04:22,029
There's no age limit,
as long as you can do the work.

861
01:04:32,843 --> 01:04:35,141
And you have trouble sleeping?
Thank you.

862
01:04:35,245 --> 01:04:38,442
I didn't think I did.
I usually sleep like a baby.

863
01:04:39,416 --> 01:04:41,850
Something's been keeping me up.

864
01:04:43,086 --> 01:04:44,280
My father, in his 80s,

865
01:04:44,388 --> 01:04:47,653
he was so convinced
he was gonna die in his sleep,

866
01:04:48,291 --> 01:04:51,419
he limited himself
to having afternoon naps.

867
01:04:52,195 --> 01:04:54,959
He was so determined
he was gonna cheat death.

868
01:04:56,133 --> 01:04:57,998
- Did he?
- Did he what?

869
01:04:58,135 --> 01:04:59,762
Die in his sleep?

870
01:05:01,471 --> 01:05:04,065
He died sitting in his favorite chair

871
01:05:04,174 --> 01:05:06,802
listening to his favorite program
on the wireless.

872
01:05:06,910 --> 01:05:09,378
He must have known something.

873
01:05:15,118 --> 01:05:20,181
My husband's the British Trade Minister,
and we've been here for 14 months.

874
01:05:20,290 --> 01:05:23,623
- Good God.
- We were supposed to go to Peking

875
01:05:23,727 --> 01:05:27,185
but it never seemed to work out.

876
01:05:28,665 --> 01:05:30,360
Have you been in the Far East?

877
01:05:30,467 --> 01:05:32,662
No. I've never been anywhere, really.

878
01:05:32,769 --> 01:05:35,203
I mean, outside of harbors.

879
01:05:35,305 --> 01:05:36,966
And where is it that you're from?

880
01:05:37,074 --> 01:05:39,565
New Orleans. Louisiana.

881
01:05:41,078 --> 01:05:43,376
I didn't know there was another.

882
01:05:45,682 --> 01:05:50,710
<i>And she told me about all the places
she had been, and what she had seen.</i>

883
01:05:52,322 --> 01:05:55,223
<i>And we talked till just before the dawn.</i>

884
01:05:56,259 --> 01:05:57,726
I'm just a lush, myself.

885
01:05:57,828 --> 01:06:02,765
<i>And we went back to our rooms,
to our separate lives.</i>

886
01:06:08,205 --> 01:06:11,504
<i>But every night,
we'd meet again in that lobby.</i>

887
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:20,749
<i>A hotel in the middle of the night
can be a magical place.</i>

888
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:26,521
<i>A mouse running, and stopping.</i>

889
01:06:27,958 --> 01:06:30,051
<i>A radiator hissing.</i>

890
01:06:31,061 --> 01:06:32,926
<i>A curtain blowing.</i>

891
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:40,067
<i>There's something peaceful,
even comforting</i>

892
01:06:40,170 --> 01:06:43,401
<i>knowing that the people you love
are asleep in their beds</i>

893
01:06:43,507 --> 01:06:45,737
<i>where nothing can harm them.</i>

894
01:06:48,845 --> 01:06:51,780
<i>Elizabeth and I would lose track
of the night</i>

895
01:06:52,315 --> 01:06:54,476
<i>until just before daybreak.</i>

896
01:06:57,087 --> 01:06:59,885
I think I may have given you
the wrong impression.

897
01:06:59,990 --> 01:07:01,514
Beg pardon?

898
01:07:01,625 --> 01:07:05,425
Well, married women don't customarily
sit around

899
01:07:05,529 --> 01:07:07,554
in the middle of the night
with strange men in hotels.

900
01:07:07,664 --> 01:07:11,191
I wouldn't know what a married woman
does or doesn't do.

901
01:07:16,973 --> 01:07:18,406
Good night.

902
01:07:20,744 --> 01:07:22,041
Murmansk.

903
01:07:24,681 --> 01:07:27,741
"I've met somebody,
and I've fallen in love. "

904
01:07:27,851 --> 01:07:29,045
Mom?

905
01:07:32,889 --> 01:07:35,414
That was over 60 years ago.

906
01:07:36,726 --> 01:07:37,750
Did you love him, Mother?

907
01:07:37,861 --> 01:07:40,625
What does a girl know about love?

908
01:08:14,231 --> 01:08:15,425
Well...

909
01:08:17,934 --> 01:08:21,700
- I'm not dressed.
- Oh, you look splendid, just as you are.

910
01:08:23,974 --> 01:08:27,034
Don't waste any time bothering about
the wine or the cheese in Murmansk,

911
01:08:27,143 --> 01:08:30,169
'cause they're really
completely ordinary,

912
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:35,240
but the caviar and the vodka

913
01:08:35,819 --> 01:08:39,915
are sublime and plentiful.

914
01:08:43,727 --> 01:08:44,989
So.

915
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:51,597
Savor it.

916
01:08:53,737 --> 01:08:55,705
And don't eat it all at once,

917
01:08:55,805 --> 01:08:58,899
because that way,
there's nothing left to enjoy.

918
01:09:00,577 --> 01:09:04,911
And now, take a little swallow of vodka
while it's still in your mouth.

919
01:09:19,796 --> 01:09:22,629
You haven't been with many women,
have you?

920
01:09:23,833 --> 01:09:25,460
Not on Sundays.

921
01:09:27,671 --> 01:09:29,400
And you've never had caviar before,
have you?

922
01:09:29,506 --> 01:09:31,133
No, ma'am.

923
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:38,641
When I was 19,

924
01:09:39,649 --> 01:09:45,918
I attempted to become the first woman
ever to swim the English Channel.

925
01:09:46,923 --> 01:09:48,322
Really?

926
01:09:48,958 --> 01:09:51,984
But the current that day
was so strong that,

927
01:09:52,095 --> 01:09:55,189
for every stroke I took,
I was pushed back two.

928
01:09:55,799 --> 01:09:58,393
<i>I was in the water for 32 hours.</i>

929
01:09:59,369 --> 01:10:03,203
And when I was two miles from Calais,

930
01:10:04,341 --> 01:10:06,070
<i>it started to rain.</i>

931
01:10:06,810 --> 01:10:08,710
That's it! Steady on!

932
01:10:09,245 --> 01:10:11,873
<i>When I couldn't go any further,</i>

933
01:10:13,483 --> 01:10:14,916
I stopped.

934
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:17,911
<i>I just stopped.</i>

935
01:10:18,521 --> 01:10:23,390
And everybody asked me,
would I try again?

936
01:10:24,127 --> 01:10:25,992
<i>For why wouldn't I?</i>

937
01:10:28,898 --> 01:10:30,593
But I never did.

938
01:10:32,035 --> 01:10:36,267
As a matter of fact, I've never done
anything with my life after that.

939
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:42,435
Your hands are so coarse.

940
01:10:52,789 --> 01:10:55,349
I can feel the wind in your cheek.

941
01:11:02,132 --> 01:11:04,623
I'm afraid it's the witching hour.

942
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:13,771
<i>It was the first time
a woman had ever kissed me.</i>

943
01:11:14,344 --> 01:11:16,744
<i>It's something you never forget.</i>

944
01:11:27,257 --> 01:11:29,282
I think you make me feel younger.

945
01:11:29,392 --> 01:11:31,917
You make me feel years younger, too.

946
01:11:32,028 --> 01:11:33,620
I wish I was.

947
01:11:34,631 --> 01:11:36,758
So many things I'd change.

948
01:11:37,467 --> 01:11:39,799
I'd undo all my mistakes.

949
01:11:39,903 --> 01:11:41,598
What mistakes?

950
01:11:44,941 --> 01:11:47,102
I kept waiting, you know?

951
01:11:47,744 --> 01:11:52,238
Thinking that I'd do something
to change my circumstances.

952
01:11:53,516 --> 01:11:55,245
Do something.

953
01:11:56,820 --> 01:12:00,051
Such an awful waste.
You never get it back.

954
01:12:00,523 --> 01:12:01,990
Wasted time.

955
01:12:08,298 --> 01:12:10,698
If we're going to have an affair,

956
01:12:11,434 --> 01:12:14,267
you're never to look at me
during the day.

957
01:12:14,904 --> 01:12:17,839
And we're always to part before sunrise.

958
01:12:18,508 --> 01:12:21,136
And we will never say "I love you. "

959
01:12:22,779 --> 01:12:24,576
Those are the rules.

960
01:12:27,183 --> 01:12:29,344
- Are you cold?
- I'm freezing.

961
01:12:29,452 --> 01:12:31,386
Oh, you! You're frozen.

962
01:12:31,488 --> 01:12:34,685
What an idiot, I'm standing here
in this fur. How thoughtless of me.

963
01:13:08,358 --> 01:13:11,156
<i>She was the first woman
that ever loved me.</i>

964
01:13:14,130 --> 01:13:15,358
You want me to skip some?

965
01:13:15,465 --> 01:13:21,233
No, I'm glad he had somebody
to keep him warm.

966
01:13:24,908 --> 01:13:27,376
"I couldn't wait to see her again. "

967
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:42,588
<i>We saw each other every night.</i>

968
01:13:43,192 --> 01:13:45,490
<i>We always used the same room.</i>

969
01:13:47,463 --> 01:13:50,796
<i>But each time seemed new
and different.</i>

970
01:13:52,201 --> 01:13:53,634
Come here.

971
01:14:01,110 --> 01:14:02,509
Elizabeth.

972
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:05,279
Good night.

973
01:14:07,984 --> 01:14:09,611
<i>Until one night.</i>

974
01:14:46,889 --> 01:14:52,486
<i>Yesterday, December 7th, 1941,</i>

975
01:14:52,595 --> 01:14:55,689
<i>a date which will live in infamy...</i>

976
01:14:55,798 --> 01:14:59,928
It's a meeting, a policy meeting
regarding your future,

977
01:15:00,870 --> 01:15:02,428
possibly beyond.

978
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:06,400
There's been a change of plan, lads.

979
01:15:06,609 --> 01:15:09,203
As you may or may not know,

980
01:15:09,312 --> 01:15:11,906
the Japs bombed
Pearl Harbor yesterday.

981
01:15:12,348 --> 01:15:15,806
Frank D. Roosevelt's asked
each of us to do our part.

982
01:15:16,319 --> 01:15:20,415
<i>The Chelsea's been commissioned
to serve in the United States Navy.</i>

983
01:15:20,857 --> 01:15:24,122
To repair, to salvage, and to rescue.

984
01:15:25,662 --> 01:15:29,996
Anybody doesn't want to go to war,
now is the time to say so.

985
01:15:30,099 --> 01:15:34,297
Once you set foot on that boat,
you're in the Navy, friend.

986
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:40,566
Yeah, I've been meaning
to talk with you, Mike.

987
01:15:40,677 --> 01:15:42,668
My wife's doing poorly.

988
01:15:42,779 --> 01:15:45,509
I'd like to maybe see her one more time.

989
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:51,050
You're free to make your way home
any way you can, Mr. Mayes.

990
01:15:56,693 --> 01:15:58,456
Well, if he's leaving, who's gonna cook?

991
01:15:58,561 --> 01:16:02,622
Food poisoning's one of the leading
causes of death at sea.

992
01:16:02,732 --> 01:16:05,098
Right after
inadequate safety equipment.

993
01:16:05,201 --> 01:16:07,829
I can cook, Captain.
Been doing it all my life.

994
01:16:07,937 --> 01:16:12,340
I don't know.
You're a little moody for war, Benjamin.

995
01:16:12,442 --> 01:16:14,410
What the hell?

996
01:16:14,510 --> 01:16:18,844
I'll take any man wants to kick the shite
out of the Japs and the Huns.

997
01:16:20,249 --> 01:16:24,015
That's it, pack your gear.
We're going to war, gentlemen!

998
01:16:30,893 --> 01:16:32,656
<i>She had left a note.</i>

999
01:16:34,030 --> 01:16:36,760
<i>She wrote,
"It was nice to have met you. "</i>

1000
01:16:37,533 --> 01:16:39,125
<i>And that was it.</i>

1001
01:16:42,371 --> 01:16:45,431
<i>It wasn't the war any of us expected.</i>

1002
01:16:45,541 --> 01:16:49,170
<i>We would just tow crippled ships,
scraps of metal, really.</i>

1003
01:16:49,779 --> 01:16:52,748
<i>If there was a war, we didn't see it.</i>

1004
01:16:54,650 --> 01:16:58,711
<i>There was a man assigned to us.
The Chief Gunner loved the Navy.</i>

1005
01:16:58,821 --> 01:17:01,016
<i>But most of all, he loved America.</i>

1006
01:17:01,124 --> 01:17:04,025
There is no other country in the world.

1007
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:05,219
When you spell America...

1008
01:17:05,328 --> 01:17:09,492
<i>His name was Dennis Smith,
and he was a full-blooded Cherokee.</i>

1009
01:17:09,599 --> 01:17:12,693
<i>His family had been Americans
for over 500 years.</i>

1010
01:17:12,802 --> 01:17:17,330
These pacifists.
They say they won't fight on conscience.

1011
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:21,035
Now, where would be
if everybody decided to act

1012
01:17:21,144 --> 01:17:25,103
- according to their conscience?
- Keep it down, would you, Chief?

1013
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:44,700
Hey. I've been watching you.

1014
01:17:45,868 --> 01:17:47,665
You seem trustworthy.

1015
01:17:49,472 --> 01:17:51,565
If something happens to me,

1016
01:17:55,645 --> 01:17:58,205
could you see that this gets to my wife?

1017
01:17:58,314 --> 01:18:02,842
<i>He'd given me all of his pay.
Hadn't spent a dime of it.</i>

1018
01:18:04,754 --> 01:18:08,019
I want my family to know
I was thinking about them.

1019
01:18:12,795 --> 01:18:14,626
All hands on deck!

1020
01:18:41,224 --> 01:18:43,419
<i>The war had finally found us.</i>

1021
01:18:46,128 --> 01:18:47,595
All stop!

1022
01:18:50,333 --> 01:18:52,324
Pleasant, man that light.

1023
01:19:00,209 --> 01:19:04,373
<i>A transport carrying 1,300 men
had been split by a torpedo.</i>

1024
01:19:06,782 --> 01:19:09,046
<i>We were first to arrive at the scene.</i>

1025
01:19:09,151 --> 01:19:12,712
- Cut the engines!
- All stop!

1026
01:19:17,860 --> 01:19:19,760
<i>We were the only sound.</i>

1027
01:19:33,709 --> 01:19:35,108
Fellas!

1028
01:19:45,087 --> 01:19:46,145
Sub!

1029
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,758
We sure as hell
can't outrun them fuckers.

1030
01:19:55,498 --> 01:19:57,796
Battle stations!

1031
01:20:07,677 --> 01:20:08,666
Thank you, Chief.

1032
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:12,072
What?

1033
01:20:25,061 --> 01:20:26,858
Is that the last one?

1034
01:21:48,477 --> 01:21:49,705
Captain!

1035
01:22:05,361 --> 01:22:07,989
They shot the hell out of my painting!

1036
01:22:09,265 --> 01:22:11,096
Give me your other hand.

1037
01:22:16,472 --> 01:22:17,496
You'll be all right, Captain.

1038
01:22:17,606 --> 01:22:21,872
They got a nice spot in Heaven
waiting for you. Nice spot.

1039
01:22:23,412 --> 01:22:26,438
You can be as mad as a mad dog
at the way things went.

1040
01:22:29,452 --> 01:22:33,115
You could swear, curse the Fates.

1041
01:22:35,424 --> 01:22:37,551
But when it comes to the end,

1042
01:22:39,762 --> 01:22:41,491
you have to let go.

1043
01:22:48,504 --> 01:22:49,732
Captain?

1044
01:23:10,593 --> 01:23:13,892
<i>Thirteen hundred and twenty eight men
died that day.</i>

1045
01:23:16,198 --> 01:23:19,429
<i>I said my goodbyes to the Cherokee,
Dennis Smith.</i>

1046
01:23:20,402 --> 01:23:23,599
<i>John Grimm, who was right,
he was gonna die there.</i>

1047
01:23:25,107 --> 01:23:27,803
<i>I sent Pleasant Curtis' wife his money.</i>

1048
01:23:28,644 --> 01:23:31,704
<i>I said goodbye to the twin, Vic Brody,</i>

1049
01:23:31,814 --> 01:23:36,478
<i>and to Mike Clark,
captain of the tugboat Chelsea.</i>

1050
01:23:38,954 --> 01:23:43,414
<i>I said goodbye to all the other men
who had dreams of their own,</i>

1051
01:23:43,526 --> 01:23:46,086
<i>all the men
who wanted to be insurance salesmen</i>

1052
01:23:46,195 --> 01:23:49,130
<i>or doctors or lawyers or Indian chiefs.</i>

1053
01:23:50,199 --> 01:23:51,996
This don't get fixed.

1054
01:23:54,103 --> 01:23:57,163
<i>Out here, death didn't seem natural.</i>

1055
01:24:14,190 --> 01:24:17,353
<i>I'd never seen a hummingbird
that far out to sea.</i>

1056
01:24:18,894 --> 01:24:20,486
<i>Before or since.</i>

1057
01:24:26,517 --> 01:24:32,752
<i>And in May of 1945,
when I was 26 years old,</i>

1058
01:24:32,857 --> 01:24:33,958
<i>I came home.</i>

1059
01:24:34,859 --> 01:24:37,453
I'm ready! I'm ready!

1060
01:24:37,561 --> 01:24:38,926
I'm coming!

1061
01:24:39,830 --> 01:24:43,459
- I'm ready!
- All right, I'm coming, Miss Alfalina.

1062
01:24:43,567 --> 01:24:45,057
- Queenie?
- Yes?

1063
01:24:50,941 --> 01:24:56,846
Sweet Jesus! Oh, you're home!
Oh, Lord, you came back!

1064
01:24:57,748 --> 01:24:59,682
- Let me look at you.
- Who's that, Mama?

1065
01:24:59,784 --> 01:25:03,049
- Child, it's your brother, Benjamin.
- I didn't know he was my brother.

1066
01:25:03,154 --> 01:25:04,815
There's a shitload of things
you don't know, child.

1067
01:25:04,922 --> 01:25:06,082
Get on out there and finish sweeping.

1068
01:25:06,190 --> 01:25:08,351
Come here, wash your hands,
help me with the table. Go on, now.

1069
01:25:08,459 --> 01:25:12,361
Turn around.
You look like you've been born again.

1070
01:25:12,463 --> 01:25:14,727
Younger than the springtime.

1071
01:25:14,832 --> 01:25:18,461
I think that preacher laid hands on you
gave you a second life.

1072
01:25:18,569 --> 01:25:22,198
I knew it that moment I saw you,
you were special.

1073
01:25:22,306 --> 01:25:24,171
I tell you what, my knees are sore,

1074
01:25:24,275 --> 01:25:26,800
'cause I've been on them every night
asking the Lord,

1075
01:25:26,911 --> 01:25:30,642
I said,
"God, just bring him home safely. "

1076
01:25:30,748 --> 01:25:33,239
Remember what I told you?

1077
01:25:33,350 --> 01:25:34,977
"You never know
what's coming for you"?

1078
01:25:35,086 --> 01:25:36,986
That's right. Sit down.

1079
01:25:38,389 --> 01:25:42,485
Well, you learn anything
worth repeating?

1080
01:25:44,595 --> 01:25:48,827
- I sure saw some things.
- Oh, you seen some pain.

1081
01:25:50,334 --> 01:25:53,098
- Some joy, too?
- Sure. Sure, I did.

1082
01:25:53,204 --> 01:25:57,334
Yeah, that's what I want to hear.
Look at you.

1083
01:25:57,441 --> 01:26:00,933
- Where's Tizzy?
- Oh, baby.

1084
01:26:03,414 --> 01:26:07,282
Mr. Weathers died in his sleep
one night last April.

1085
01:26:07,384 --> 01:26:10,842
- Mama, I'm so sorry.
- Don't you worry about that, baby.

1086
01:26:12,590 --> 01:26:15,218
Yeah, well, it's only
one or two of them left now.

1087
01:26:15,326 --> 01:26:16,793
They all just about new.

1088
01:26:16,894 --> 01:26:20,796
Guess they're waiting their turn
like everybody else, huh?

1089
01:26:20,898 --> 01:26:23,628
I'm so glad you're back home with me!

1090
01:26:23,734 --> 01:26:26,862
Now, we're gonna have to find you
a wife and a new job! That's right.

1091
01:26:26,971 --> 01:26:28,836
Come on in here,
help me with this table.

1092
01:26:32,009 --> 01:26:33,601
Benjamin.

1093
01:26:33,711 --> 01:26:36,839
You're wasting your time, baby.
She's stone deaf.

1094
01:26:36,947 --> 01:26:40,974
Oh, and you'll be staying in
what was Mrs. DeSeroux's old room.

1095
01:26:41,085 --> 01:26:43,986
You're too big to be rooming
with anybody else.

1096
01:26:48,125 --> 01:26:50,719
<i>It's a funny thing about coming home.</i>

1097
01:26:51,395 --> 01:26:55,161
<i>Looks the same,
smells the same, feels the same.</i>

1098
01:26:57,935 --> 01:27:01,769
Did I ever tell you I've been struck
by lightning seven times?

1099
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:06,807
Once when I was sitting in my truck,
just minding my own business.

1100
01:27:12,683 --> 01:27:16,119
<i>You realize what's changed is you.</i>

1101
01:27:18,789 --> 01:27:22,816
<i>And late one morning,
not long after I'd been back...</i>

1102
01:27:23,227 --> 01:27:24,558
Thank you.

1103
01:27:46,650 --> 01:27:47,708
Hey.

1104
01:27:52,289 --> 01:27:56,157
- Excuse me, is Queenie here?
- Daisy?

1105
01:27:59,930 --> 01:28:03,525
- It's me, Benjamin.
- Benjamin?

1106
01:28:07,271 --> 01:28:09,239
Oh, my God!

1107
01:28:10,541 --> 01:28:14,443
Of course it's you! Benjamin!

1108
01:28:16,547 --> 01:28:19,414
How are you?
It's been such a long time.

1109
01:28:19,516 --> 01:28:22,246
There's so much I want to know.
When did you get back?

1110
01:28:22,353 --> 01:28:23,752
Well, I got back a few weeks ago.

1111
01:28:23,854 --> 01:28:27,847
I spoke to Queenie, she said you were
in the war, somewhere at sea.

1112
01:28:27,958 --> 01:28:31,689
- We were so, so worried about you.
- Oh, I'm okay.

1113
01:28:31,795 --> 01:28:35,663
Well, look at you. You're so lovely.

1114
01:28:37,468 --> 01:28:39,231
You stopped writing.

1115
01:28:41,338 --> 01:28:46,435
"When I had left, she was a girl.
And a woman had taken her place.

1116
01:28:46,777 --> 01:28:49,940
"She was the most beautiful woman
I'd ever seen. "

1117
01:28:50,047 --> 01:28:51,378
Beautiful.

1118
01:28:53,584 --> 01:28:55,381
"The most beautiful. "

1119
01:28:57,187 --> 01:28:58,916
- You remember Grandma Fuller?
- Why, sure I do.

1120
01:28:59,023 --> 01:29:02,083
- She passed.
- I heard that. I'm sorry.

1121
01:29:02,192 --> 01:29:06,788
I just can't believe we're both here.
Must be fate.

1122
01:29:06,897 --> 01:29:08,865
No, no, what do they call it?

1123
01:29:08,966 --> 01:29:10,365
Kismet.

1124
01:29:10,467 --> 01:29:12,367
Do you know about Edgar Cayce,
the psychic?

1125
01:29:12,469 --> 01:29:13,458
I don't believe I...

1126
01:29:13,570 --> 01:29:16,437
He says
that everything is predetermined,

1127
01:29:16,540 --> 01:29:19,873
but I like to think of it as fate.

1128
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:26,345
I'm not sure how it works,
but I'm glad it happened.

1129
01:29:26,450 --> 01:29:30,045
Have you been to Manhattan?
It's right across the river from me.

1130
01:29:30,154 --> 01:29:32,281
Now, I can see
the Empire State Building

1131
01:29:32,389 --> 01:29:34,152
if I stand on my bed.

1132
01:29:34,258 --> 01:29:36,249
What about you?
Where have you been?

1133
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:39,955
Tell me everything. Last time you wrote,
you said you'd been to Russia.

1134
01:29:40,064 --> 01:29:44,228
I've always wanted to go to Russia.
Is it as cold as they say?

1135
01:29:44,335 --> 01:29:47,099
- Twice as cold.
- My goodness.

1136
01:29:47,705 --> 01:29:52,369
We always said you were different.
But I think you really are.

1137
01:29:54,478 --> 01:29:58,005
You wrote that you met somebody.
Did it work out?

1138
01:29:58,515 --> 01:30:00,176
It ran its course.

1139
01:30:01,552 --> 01:30:03,577
Hey, do you remember this?

1140
01:30:14,498 --> 01:30:17,194
"This is the picture
of Old Man Kangaroo

1141
01:30:17,301 --> 01:30:19,394
"at 5:00 in the afternoon. "

1142
01:30:21,238 --> 01:30:23,433
Would you like to have dinner?

1143
01:30:30,948 --> 01:30:33,849
<i>Did I tell you
that I danced for Balanchine?</i>

1144
01:30:34,551 --> 01:30:39,045
<i>Oh, he's a famous choreographer.
He said that I had perfect line.</i>

1145
01:30:40,791 --> 01:30:45,319
<i>You know, in a rehearsal once,
a dancer fell.</i>

1146
01:30:45,429 --> 01:30:48,227
<i>And he just...
He just put it right into the production.</i>

1147
01:30:48,332 --> 01:30:51,824
<i>I mean, can you imagine that?
Like in a... In a classical ballet?</i>

1148
01:30:51,935 --> 01:30:55,166
<i>You know, a dancer,
intentionally falling.</i>

1149
01:30:55,272 --> 01:30:58,901
<i>There's a whole new word
for dance now. It's called "abstract. "</i>

1150
01:30:59,009 --> 01:31:00,340
<i>No, he's not the only one, though.</i>

1151
01:31:00,444 --> 01:31:04,346
<i>There's Lincoln Kirstein
and Lucia Chase, and oh, my...</i>

1152
01:31:04,448 --> 01:31:06,939
<i>Oh, there's Agnes de Mille.</i>

1153
01:31:07,050 --> 01:31:09,109
<i>She's just torn up all those conventions,</i>

1154
01:31:09,219 --> 01:31:11,187
<i>you know,
all that straight-up-and-down stuff.</i>

1155
01:31:11,288 --> 01:31:14,485
<i>It's not about the formality of the dance,
it's about what the dancer's feeling.</i>

1156
01:31:14,591 --> 01:31:17,287
<i>As she told me
about this big new world,</i>

1157
01:31:17,394 --> 01:31:19,885
<i>names that didn't mean a thing to me,</i>

1158
01:31:19,997 --> 01:31:22,056
<i>I didn't really hear very much
of what she was saying.</i>

1159
01:31:22,166 --> 01:31:24,396
<i>It's new and it's modern
and it's American.</i>

1160
01:31:24,501 --> 01:31:27,664
They understand our vigor
and our physicality.

1161
01:31:27,771 --> 01:31:29,898
Oh, my God.
I've just been talking and talking.

1162
01:31:30,073 --> 01:31:34,510
No, no, I've enjoyed listening.
I didn't know you smoked.

1163
01:31:34,611 --> 01:31:36,135
I'm old enough.

1164
01:31:39,516 --> 01:31:42,007
I'm old enough for a lot of things.

1165
01:31:44,955 --> 01:31:47,389
In New York, we stay up all night,

1166
01:31:48,659 --> 01:31:51,457
watch the sun come up
over the warehouses.

1167
01:31:53,797 --> 01:31:56,095
There's always something to do.

1168
01:32:13,784 --> 01:32:15,877
I have to go back tomorrow.

1169
01:32:17,054 --> 01:32:19,181
- So soon.
- Wish I could stay.

1170
01:32:23,994 --> 01:32:27,157
Dancers don't need costumes
or scenery anymore.

1171
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:30,791
I can imagine
dancing completely naked.

1172
01:32:32,102 --> 01:32:34,468
Have you read D.H. Lawrence?

1173
01:32:34,571 --> 01:32:36,664
- Well...
- His books were banned.

1174
01:32:36,773 --> 01:32:40,300
The words are like making love.

1175
01:33:24,855 --> 01:33:29,451
In our company,
we have to trust each other.

1176
01:33:34,765 --> 01:33:38,428
Sex is a part of it.

1177
01:33:42,839 --> 01:33:45,740
You know,
a lot of the dancers are lesbians.

1178
01:33:47,878 --> 01:33:50,972
There was one woman
who wanted to sleep with me.

1179
01:33:58,288 --> 01:34:01,280
- Does that upset you?
- Which part?

1180
01:34:02,392 --> 01:34:04,826
Somebody wanting to sleep with me.

1181
01:34:05,362 --> 01:34:06,522
You're a desirable woman.

1182
01:34:06,630 --> 01:34:10,361
I would think most of them
would want to sleep with you.

1183
01:34:10,467 --> 01:34:12,526
Let's go back to the house.

1184
01:34:13,503 --> 01:34:15,903
Or we could get a room somewhere.

1185
01:34:18,875 --> 01:34:22,072
- We could lay down your jacket.
- I don't know, Daisy.

1186
01:34:22,179 --> 01:34:27,515
It's not that I wouldn't like to or anything.
I think I'll just disappoint you.

1187
01:34:28,452 --> 01:34:31,512
Oh, Benjamin, I've been with older men.

1188
01:34:32,322 --> 01:34:34,313
You're going back to New York
in the morning.

1189
01:34:34,424 --> 01:34:36,756
You should be with your friends.

1190
01:34:37,761 --> 01:34:40,252
- You're only young once.
- Oh, I'm old enough.

1191
01:34:40,364 --> 01:34:42,958
Daisy, just not tonight, is all.

1192
01:34:56,513 --> 01:34:58,640
We could go hear some music.

1193
01:35:00,917 --> 01:35:03,613
<i>Our lives are defined by opportunities.</i>

1194
01:35:04,454 --> 01:35:06,445
<i>Even the ones we miss.</i>

1195
01:35:07,324 --> 01:35:10,953
You look so handsome
and so distinguished.

1196
01:35:11,061 --> 01:35:13,222
They're saying the hurricane's
gonna miss us, blow right on by.

1197
01:35:13,330 --> 01:35:17,926
- Oh, that's great.
- I'll stay under the blankets with Mother.

1198
01:35:18,035 --> 01:35:22,096
She says nothing... Benjamin?

1199
01:35:24,041 --> 01:35:25,099
"Things were becoming different... "

1200
01:35:25,208 --> 01:35:26,368
<i>...for me.</i>

1201
01:35:26,476 --> 01:35:30,071
<i>My hair had very little gray
and grew like weeds.</i>

1202
01:35:30,180 --> 01:35:33,946
<i>My sense of smell was keener.
My hearing, more acute.</i>

1203
01:35:34,051 --> 01:35:36,679
<i>I could walk further and faster.</i>

1204
01:35:36,787 --> 01:35:42,555
<i>While everybody else was aging,
I was getting younger, all alone.</i>

1205
01:35:45,595 --> 01:35:46,823
Come in.

1206
01:35:48,231 --> 01:35:49,528
Benjamin.

1207
01:35:50,534 --> 01:35:53,731
- Do you remember me?
- Well, sure I do, Mr. Button.

1208
01:35:54,438 --> 01:35:57,999
- What happened to you?
- Darn foot. Got infected, so...

1209
01:35:59,676 --> 01:36:00,904
Welcome home, my friend.

1210
01:36:03,613 --> 01:36:06,707
I see you're still drinking
your Sazerac with whiskey.

1211
01:36:06,817 --> 01:36:08,045
Creature of habit.

1212
01:36:08,151 --> 01:36:10,244
You still visiting the house
on Bourbon Street?

1213
01:36:10,353 --> 01:36:12,082
Not for a long time.

1214
01:36:13,690 --> 01:36:15,783
Interesting times, though.

1215
01:36:15,892 --> 01:36:20,329
We went from making 40,000
to nearly half a million buttons a day.

1216
01:36:20,430 --> 01:36:22,421
We employed 10 times
the number of people.

1217
01:36:22,532 --> 01:36:25,023
We were operating around the clock.

1218
01:36:29,606 --> 01:36:30,971
Damn shame.

1219
01:36:32,109 --> 01:36:35,044
The war has been kind
to the button industry.

1220
01:36:37,781 --> 01:36:39,112
You know,

1221
01:36:41,384 --> 01:36:44,717
I'm sick.
I don't know how much longer I have.

1222
01:36:44,821 --> 01:36:47,654
- I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Button.
- No...

1223
01:36:49,059 --> 01:36:52,119
I don't have any people.
I keep to myself.

1224
01:36:54,631 --> 01:36:57,623
I hope you don't mind,
but, whenever possible,

1225
01:36:57,734 --> 01:36:59,725
I'd enjoy your company.

1226
01:36:59,836 --> 01:37:02,327
I'll certainly do what I can.

1227
01:37:05,642 --> 01:37:08,543
Benjamin, do you know anything
about buttons?

1228
01:37:12,149 --> 01:37:16,779
Now, Button's Buttons has been
in our family for 124 years.

1229
01:37:17,454 --> 01:37:22,050
My grandfather was a tailor,
and he had a small shop in Richmond.

1230
01:37:22,159 --> 01:37:24,559
After the Civil War,
he moved to New Orleans,

1231
01:37:24,661 --> 01:37:29,689
where my father had the wisdom
to make our own buttons.

1232
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:34,669
So, with his help,
the tailor shop grew to this.

1233
01:37:35,405 --> 01:37:37,999
And today, I can't sew a stitch.

1234
01:37:42,212 --> 01:37:44,544
That's very, very interesting.

1235
01:37:48,018 --> 01:37:50,612
You sure have done well for yourself.

1236
01:37:51,555 --> 01:37:55,616
So, what can I do for you, Mr. Button?

1237
01:37:58,161 --> 01:38:01,153
Benjamin? You're my son.

1238
01:38:08,705 --> 01:38:11,333
I'm so sorry I never told you before.

1239
01:38:13,510 --> 01:38:16,877
You were born
the night the Great War ended.

1240
01:38:18,782 --> 01:38:22,479
Your mother died giving birth to you.

1241
01:38:23,987 --> 01:38:26,182
I thought you were a monster.

1242
01:38:29,759 --> 01:38:33,024
I promised your mother
I'd make sure you were safe.

1243
01:38:39,469 --> 01:38:41,903
I should never have abandoned you.

1244
01:38:46,042 --> 01:38:47,373
My mother?

1245
01:38:48,745 --> 01:38:51,680
At the summer house
on Lake Pontchartrain.

1246
01:38:51,781 --> 01:38:55,217
When I was a boy,
I'd love to wake up before anyone else,

1247
01:38:55,318 --> 01:38:58,310
run down to that lake
and watch the day begin.

1248
01:38:59,990 --> 01:39:02,618
It was as if I was the only one alive.

1249
01:39:04,461 --> 01:39:07,157
I fell in love the first time I saw her.

1250
01:39:07,731 --> 01:39:10,359
Your mother's name
was Caroline Murphy.

1251
01:39:11,001 --> 01:39:13,868
She worked
in your grandfather's kitchen.

1252
01:39:17,140 --> 01:39:18,801
She's from Dublin.

1253
01:39:19,476 --> 01:39:23,879
In 1903, Caroline and all her brothers
and sisters came to live here,

1254
01:39:23,980 --> 01:39:25,504
in New Orleans.

1255
01:39:27,651 --> 01:39:30,484
I'd find excuses
to go down to that kitchen

1256
01:39:31,321 --> 01:39:33,448
just so I could look at her.

1257
01:39:39,829 --> 01:39:43,560
April 25th, 1918.
Happiest day of my life.

1258
01:39:44,334 --> 01:39:46,564
The day I married your mother.

1259
01:39:48,305 --> 01:39:50,432
Why didn't you just tell me?

1260
01:39:51,308 --> 01:39:54,141
I plan on leaving everything I have
to you.

1261
01:39:55,679 --> 01:39:58,113
- I have to go.
- Where?

1262
01:39:59,182 --> 01:40:00,547
Home.

1263
01:40:01,251 --> 01:40:02,582
And what does he think, anyway?

1264
01:40:02,686 --> 01:40:03,983
He thinks he can just show up

1265
01:40:04,087 --> 01:40:05,952
and everything's
supposed to be fine and dandy.

1266
01:40:06,056 --> 01:40:08,650
Everybody's just supposed to be friends.

1267
01:40:08,758 --> 01:40:11,659
Well, he got another thing coming,
that's for sure.

1268
01:40:11,761 --> 01:40:15,162
God be my witness,
he got another thing coming.

1269
01:40:15,265 --> 01:40:18,325
He left us $18 that night you was found.

1270
01:40:18,435 --> 01:40:20,266
Eighteen ratty dollars

1271
01:40:20,370 --> 01:40:22,065
- and a filthy diaper.
- Good night, Mama.

1272
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:24,634
Good night, baby.

1273
01:40:37,921 --> 01:40:42,255
Did I ever tell you
I was struck by lightning seven times?

1274
01:40:44,060 --> 01:40:46,085
Once, I was walking my dog
down the road.

1275
01:40:51,101 --> 01:40:54,935
I'm blind in the one eye,
can't hardly hear,

1276
01:40:56,206 --> 01:41:00,802
get twitches and shakes out of nowhere,
always losing my line of thought.

1277
01:41:02,379 --> 01:41:04,040
But you know what?

1278
01:41:04,814 --> 01:41:07,749
God keeps reminding me
I'm lucky to be alive.

1279
01:41:13,523 --> 01:41:15,047
Storm's coming.

1280
01:41:42,986 --> 01:41:45,216
May I help you, sir?
Up the stairs, first bedroom.

1281
01:41:45,321 --> 01:41:46,379
Thank you.

1282
01:42:02,272 --> 01:42:03,500
Wake up.

1283
01:42:06,042 --> 01:42:07,907
Let's get you dressed.

1284
01:42:35,338 --> 01:42:36,965
Now that's something.

1285
01:42:40,276 --> 01:42:41,607
Thank you.

1286
01:43:41,771 --> 01:43:45,730
<i>You can be mad as a mad dog
at the way things went.</i>

1287
01:43:45,842 --> 01:43:48,242
<i>You can swear and curse the Fates.</i>

1288
01:43:49,846 --> 01:43:52,041
<i>But when it comes to the end,</i>

1289
01:43:53,283 --> 01:43:55,012
<i>you have to let go.</i>

1290
01:44:17,006 --> 01:44:19,600
Well, it sure is a beautiful service.

1291
01:44:21,477 --> 01:44:24,275
He'll be buried
right next to your mother.

1292
01:44:25,748 --> 01:44:27,375
You're my mother.

1293
01:44:31,221 --> 01:44:32,449
My baby.

1294
01:44:37,060 --> 01:44:39,187
<i>Now, I'd never seen New York.</i>

1295
01:46:07,383 --> 01:46:10,750
- Excuse me, I'm a friend of Daisy's.
- Right this way.

1296
01:46:11,821 --> 01:46:17,157
- Daisy has company. Daisy! Daisy!
- Yes!

1297
01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:20,825
- We need the wardrobe.
- Is somebody looking for me?

1298
01:46:23,433 --> 01:46:24,528
- Benjamin.
- Hi.

1299
01:46:24,563 --> 01:46:25,623
- Benjamin.
- Hi.

1300
01:46:26,936 --> 01:46:30,702
- What are you doing here?
- Thought I'd come visit.

1301
01:46:30,807 --> 01:46:34,265
Spend some time with you, if I could.

1302
01:46:34,377 --> 01:46:40,247
Oh, well, I wish you would've called.
You took me by surprise.

1303
01:46:41,617 --> 01:46:45,747
- You can just throw them out.
- No. Thank you, they're lovely.

1304
01:46:46,389 --> 01:46:51,190
I couldn't take my eyes off of you.
I thought you were mesmerizing.

1305
01:46:53,229 --> 01:46:56,027
Thank you.
That's very kind of you to say.

1306
01:47:01,371 --> 01:47:03,396
I better get changed.
A group of us are going to a party.

1307
01:47:03,506 --> 01:47:06,771
- Would you want to come?
- Someone told me about a restaurant

1308
01:47:06,876 --> 01:47:08,138
I thought you might enjoy.

1309
01:47:08,244 --> 01:47:10,735
I made a reservation, just in case.

1310
01:47:10,847 --> 01:47:13,839
Just, all the dancers go out
after the show. You're...

1311
01:47:13,950 --> 01:47:17,750
You're welcome to come with us.
I'll get changed. All right?

1312
01:47:24,227 --> 01:47:26,320
She choreographs
for the Ballets Russes.

1313
01:47:26,429 --> 01:47:27,726
She's divine.

1314
01:47:28,364 --> 01:47:30,195
You were breathtaking.

1315
01:47:35,905 --> 01:47:37,133
Sweetie.

1316
01:47:38,307 --> 01:47:41,174
This is David.
He dances with the company.

1317
01:47:42,178 --> 01:47:44,203
- This is Benjamin.
- Who?

1318
01:47:44,313 --> 01:47:47,544
- I told you about him.
- Oh, yeah. How you doing?

1319
01:47:47,650 --> 01:47:51,108
- I'll go get you a drink.
- All right. Thanks.

1320
01:47:58,828 --> 01:48:01,991
So, you were a friend
of her grandmother's?

1321
01:48:02,098 --> 01:48:03,998
Or something like that?

1322
01:48:05,168 --> 01:48:06,931
Something like that.

1323
01:48:07,270 --> 01:48:08,794
Hey, excuse me.

1324
01:48:31,160 --> 01:48:32,388
Come on.

1325
01:48:53,749 --> 01:48:54,807
Hey!

1326
01:48:55,785 --> 01:48:58,276
Now, I had no idea you were coming.

1327
01:48:59,322 --> 01:49:00,846
Lord, Benjamin.

1328
01:49:03,459 --> 01:49:07,327
What did you expect?
What, you want me to drop everything?

1329
01:49:07,430 --> 01:49:09,398
Now, this is my life.

1330
01:49:09,499 --> 01:49:11,933
Babe! You going downtown?

1331
01:49:16,906 --> 01:49:20,000
Come on. You'll have a good time.

1332
01:49:20,877 --> 01:49:22,367
There's lots of musicians,
interesting people.

1333
01:49:22,478 --> 01:49:25,379
You don't have to do that.
This is my fault.

1334
01:49:26,482 --> 01:49:27,915
I should've called.

1335
01:49:28,017 --> 01:49:30,815
I thought I'd come here

1336
01:49:30,920 --> 01:49:33,650
and sweep you off your feet
or something.

1337
01:49:35,157 --> 01:49:39,617
- Daisy! Come on! Let's go.
- Be right there.

1338
01:49:41,430 --> 01:49:42,795
Seems nice.

1339
01:49:44,166 --> 01:49:45,758
Do you love him?

1340
01:49:48,905 --> 01:49:50,270
I think so.

1341
01:49:52,408 --> 01:49:54,069
I'm happy for you.

1342
01:49:56,012 --> 01:49:58,105
Maybe I'll see you at home.

1343
01:50:00,750 --> 01:50:01,842
Okay.

1344
01:50:03,886 --> 01:50:05,615
I enjoyed the show!

1345
01:50:13,262 --> 01:50:17,756
He came to tell me his father had died.

1346
01:50:19,268 --> 01:50:25,434
- You couldn't have known.
- I was 23. I... I just didn't care.

1347
01:50:28,010 --> 01:50:29,375
What did you do next?

1348
01:50:29,478 --> 01:50:36,407
Some photographs, I think,
in the front of my bag.

1349
01:50:38,521 --> 01:50:42,617
I was as good a dancer
as I was ever gonna be.

1350
01:50:44,527 --> 01:50:46,461
For five years, I...

1351
01:50:49,231 --> 01:50:50,994
I danced everywhere.

1352
01:50:52,468 --> 01:50:55,960
London, Vienna, Prague.

1353
01:50:56,572 --> 01:50:58,437
I've never seen these.

1354
01:51:01,777 --> 01:51:02,835
Mom.

1355
01:51:04,146 --> 01:51:06,842
You never talked about your dancing.

1356
01:51:06,949 --> 01:51:08,940
Well, I was the only American

1357
01:51:09,051 --> 01:51:13,988
to be invited to dance
with the Bolshoi, sugar.

1358
01:51:15,858 --> 01:51:17,849
<i>It was glorious.</i>

1359
01:51:22,331 --> 01:51:26,028
<i>But Benjamin was never far
from my thoughts.</i>

1360
01:51:29,205 --> 01:51:32,766
<i>And I'd find myself saying...</i>

1361
01:51:32,875 --> 01:51:34,672
Good night, Benjamin.

1362
01:51:36,679 --> 01:51:40,308
- "Good night, Daisy. "
- He said that?

1363
01:51:42,485 --> 01:51:43,645
"Life wasn't all that complicated.

1364
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:47,284
<i>"If you want, you might say
I was looking for something. "</i>

1365
01:51:56,766 --> 01:51:59,735
Benjamin?
Mrs. La Tourneau just passed.

1366
01:52:06,142 --> 01:52:09,805
- Letter for Mr. Benjamin Button?
- That'd be me.

1367
01:52:12,715 --> 01:52:14,046
Thank you.

1368
01:52:40,376 --> 01:52:42,276
Miss Daisy Fuller.

1369
01:52:42,378 --> 01:52:45,176
- Just a minute. Please have a seat.
- Sure.

1370
01:52:52,655 --> 01:52:57,058
<i>Sometimes we're on a collision course
and we just don't know it.</i>

1371
01:52:57,626 --> 01:53:02,120
<i>Whether it's by accident or by design,
there's not a thing we can do about it.</i>

1372
01:53:04,967 --> 01:53:08,027
<i>A woman in Paris was on her way
to go shopping.</i>

1373
01:53:09,371 --> 01:53:13,137
<i>But she had forgotten her coat,
went back to get it.</i>

1374
01:53:13,242 --> 01:53:15,403
<i>When she had gotten her coat,
the phone had rung.</i>

1375
01:53:15,511 --> 01:53:18,503
<i>So she had stopped to answer it
and talked for a couple of minutes.</i>

1376
01:53:20,015 --> 01:53:21,812
<i>While the woman was on the phone,</i>

1377
01:53:21,917 --> 01:53:26,081
<i>Daisy was rehearsing for a performance
at the Paris Opera House.</i>

1378
01:53:26,188 --> 01:53:28,952
<i>And while she was rehearsing,
the woman, off the phone now,</i>

1379
01:53:29,058 --> 01:53:31,356
<i>had gone outside to get a taxi.</i>

1380
01:53:35,898 --> 01:53:38,196
<i>Now, a taxi driver had
dropped off a fare earlier,</i>

1381
01:53:38,300 --> 01:53:40,996
<i>and had stopped to get a cup of coffee.</i>

1382
01:53:41,904 --> 01:53:44,634
<i>And all the while, Daisy was rehearsing.</i>

1383
01:53:48,177 --> 01:53:50,675
<i>And this cab driver,
who dropped off the earlier fare</i>

1384
01:53:50,780 --> 01:53:52,748
<i>and had stopped
to get the cup of coffee,</i>

1385
01:53:52,848 --> 01:53:54,543
<i>he picked up the lady
who was going shopping</i>

1386
01:53:54,650 --> 01:53:57,346
<i>and had missed getting the earlier cab.</i>

1387
01:53:58,320 --> 01:54:00,720
<i>The taxi had to stop
for a man crossing the street,</i>

1388
01:54:00,823 --> 01:54:03,621
<i>who had left for work five minutes later
than he normally did</i>

1389
01:54:03,726 --> 01:54:06,217
<i>because he forgot to set his alarm.</i>

1390
01:54:07,029 --> 01:54:10,294
<i>While that man, late for work,
was crossing the street,</i>

1391
01:54:10,399 --> 01:54:13,835
<i>Daisy had finished rehearsing
and was taking a shower.</i>

1392
01:54:14,370 --> 01:54:15,667
<i>And while Daisy was showering,</i>

1393
01:54:15,771 --> 01:54:19,400
<i>the taxi was waiting outside a boutique
for the woman to pick up a package</i>

1394
01:54:19,508 --> 01:54:20,600
<i>which hadn't been wrapped yet,</i>

1395
01:54:20,709 --> 01:54:22,506
<i>because the girl
who was supposed to wrap it</i>

1396
01:54:22,611 --> 01:54:26,206
<i>had broken up with her boyfriend
the night before and forgot.</i>

1397
01:54:26,882 --> 01:54:30,079
<i>When the package was wrapped,
the woman, who was back in the cab,</i>

1398
01:54:30,186 --> 01:54:31,813
<i>was blocked by a delivery truck.</i>

1399
01:54:31,921 --> 01:54:34,651
<i>All the while,
Daisy was getting dressed.</i>

1400
01:54:36,158 --> 01:54:39,525
<i>The delivery truck pulled away,
and the taxi was able to move</i>

1401
01:54:39,628 --> 01:54:41,721
<i>while Daisy, the last to be dressed,</i>

1402
01:54:41,831 --> 01:54:45,358
<i>waited for one of her friends
who had broken a shoelace.</i>

1403
01:54:45,801 --> 01:54:48,736
<i>While the taxi was stopped,
waiting for a traffic light,</i>

1404
01:54:48,838 --> 01:54:52,740
<i>Daisy and her friend
came out the back of the theater.</i>

1405
01:54:52,842 --> 01:54:56,209
<i>And if only one thing
had happened differently,</i>

1406
01:54:56,312 --> 01:54:58,405
<i>if that shoelace hadn't broken</i>

1407
01:54:58,514 --> 01:55:01,005
<i>or that delivery truck
had moved moments earlier</i>

1408
01:55:01,116 --> 01:55:02,981
<i>or that package
had been wrapped and ready</i>

1409
01:55:03,085 --> 01:55:05,815
<i>because the girl hadn't broken up
with her boyfriend,</i>

1410
01:55:05,921 --> 01:55:09,584
<i>or that man had set his alarm
and got up five minutes earlier</i>

1411
01:55:09,692 --> 01:55:12,855
<i>or that taxi driver hadn't stopped
for a cup of coffee</i>

1412
01:55:12,962 --> 01:55:16,955
<i>or that woman had remembered
her coat and got into an earlier cab,</i>

1413
01:55:17,533 --> 01:55:20,195
<i>Daisy and her friend
would have crossed the street</i>

1414
01:55:20,302 --> 01:55:22,736
<i>and the taxi would have driven by.</i>

1415
01:55:33,816 --> 01:55:35,545
<i>But, life being what it is,</i>

1416
01:55:35,651 --> 01:55:38,643
<i>a series of intersecting lives
and incidents</i>

1417
01:55:38,754 --> 01:55:40,517
<i>out of anyone's control,</i>

1418
01:55:41,390 --> 01:55:44,086
<i>that taxi did not go by,</i>

1419
01:55:44,193 --> 01:55:47,026
<i>and that driver was
momentarily distracted.</i>

1420
01:55:48,030 --> 01:55:48,997
<i>Daisy!</i>

1421
01:55:49,231 --> 01:55:50,459
<i>And that taxi hit Daisy.</i>

1422
01:55:50,566 --> 01:55:52,261
Daisy! Help!

1423
01:55:55,437 --> 01:55:57,405
<i>And her leg was crushed.</i>

1424
01:56:04,813 --> 01:56:05,973
Daisy?

1425
01:56:10,286 --> 01:56:12,811
- Who told you?
- Your friend wired me.

1426
01:56:13,889 --> 01:56:17,950
Very kind of you to come all this way
to see that I was all right.

1427
01:56:19,528 --> 01:56:21,519
You'd do the same for me.

1428
01:56:23,465 --> 01:56:24,659
My God.

1429
01:56:26,802 --> 01:56:30,260
Look at you. You're perfect.

1430
01:56:33,108 --> 01:56:37,602
I wish you hadn't come here.
I don't want you to see me like this.

1431
01:56:44,053 --> 01:56:46,351
<i>Her leg had been broken in five places.</i>

1432
01:56:46,455 --> 01:56:49,549
<i>And with therapy and time,
she might walk again.</i>

1433
01:56:51,126 --> 01:56:52,991
<i>But she'd never dance.</i>

1434
01:56:54,630 --> 01:56:57,064
I'm gonna take you home with me.

1435
01:56:57,166 --> 01:56:59,930
- I want to look after you.
- I'm not going back to New Orleans.

1436
01:57:00,035 --> 01:57:02,196
Then I'll stay here in Paris.

1437
01:57:02,838 --> 01:57:05,773
Don't you understand?
I don't want your help.

1438
01:57:06,875 --> 01:57:11,209
I know I'm feeling sorry for myself,
but I don't want to be with you.

1439
01:57:11,313 --> 01:57:15,044
Tried to tell you that in New York.
You don't listen.

1440
01:57:16,585 --> 01:57:18,553
You might change your mind.

1441
01:57:18,654 --> 01:57:21,589
We are not little children
anymore, Benjamin.

1442
01:57:23,625 --> 01:57:26,856
Just stay out of my life.

1443
01:57:49,718 --> 01:57:52,949
<i>I was awfully cruel.</i>

1444
01:57:54,056 --> 01:57:59,460
He didn't understand.
I couldn't have him see me like that.

1445
01:58:02,164 --> 01:58:03,529
"I didn't leave right away.

1446
01:58:06,168 --> 01:58:09,467
<i>"I stayed in Paris for a while
to look out for her. "</i>

1447
01:58:13,075 --> 01:58:14,906
I never knew that.

1448
01:58:18,313 --> 01:58:22,374
Oh, darling, could you get the nurse?

1449
01:58:26,088 --> 01:58:31,151
I taught myself to walk again.

1450
01:58:34,229 --> 01:58:36,754
I took the train to Lourdes.

1451
01:58:38,133 --> 01:58:43,696
Let's take a look. That's normal.
Pulse rate is slowing.

1452
01:58:43,806 --> 01:58:45,797
She is gonna struggle to breathe.

1453
01:58:45,908 --> 01:58:48,103
- Will you be all right?
- Yeah.

1454
01:59:01,290 --> 01:59:07,195
All right, he says, "I went back home. "
And then there's a lot of pages torn out.

1455
01:59:07,429 --> 01:59:11,126
"I listened to the sound of the house. "
I read that already.

1456
01:59:12,067 --> 01:59:13,125
He...

1457
01:59:14,103 --> 01:59:17,368
He spilt something on it,
so it's hard to read, Mom.

1458
01:59:18,507 --> 01:59:21,271
Something about sailing,
does that make sense?

1459
01:59:21,977 --> 01:59:25,378
<i>I learned to sail an old boat
of my father's from the lake house.</i>

1460
01:59:34,590 --> 01:59:36,558
<i>I can't lie.</i>

1461
01:59:36,658 --> 01:59:39,456
<i>I did enjoy the company
of a woman or two.</i>

1462
01:59:47,803 --> 01:59:49,327
<i>Or maybe three.</i>

1463
02:00:25,874 --> 02:00:30,106
Don't know why you bother, Sam,
just gonna be there again tomorrow.

1464
02:00:34,483 --> 02:00:35,575
Mama.

1465
02:00:40,489 --> 02:00:42,957
<i>And in the spring of 1962,</i>

1466
02:00:46,828 --> 02:00:48,318
<i>she came back.</i>

1467
02:01:07,716 --> 02:01:11,345
- You want to know where I've been?
- No.

1468
02:01:13,355 --> 02:01:18,258
How come you didn't write or nothing?
Just disappearing like that.

1469
02:01:18,360 --> 02:01:20,920
It was something I needed to do
for myself.

1470
02:01:21,029 --> 02:01:24,760
Yeah, well, I never took you
to be the selfish type.

1471
02:01:24,866 --> 02:01:27,300
I sure hope I'm not wrong.

1472
02:01:28,470 --> 02:01:30,529
I'm usually not wrong about people.

1473
02:01:30,639 --> 02:01:33,164
- Good night, Mama.
- Good night, baby.

1474
02:01:34,142 --> 02:01:35,769
Y'all have fun.

1475
02:01:38,547 --> 02:01:42,881
- You haven't said two words.
- I don't want to ruin it.

1476
02:02:13,081 --> 02:02:15,379
- Sleep with me?
- Absolutely.

1477
02:02:53,155 --> 02:02:55,555
<i>I asked her to come away with me.</i>

1478
02:02:57,826 --> 02:03:00,886
<i>We sailed into the Gulf
along the Florida Keys.</i>

1479
02:03:42,270 --> 02:03:46,639
I am so glad we didn't find one another
when I was 26.

1480
02:03:46,742 --> 02:03:51,042
- Why do you say that?
- I was so young.

1481
02:03:51,146 --> 02:03:52,909
And you were so old.

1482
02:03:53,615 --> 02:03:56,516
It happened
when it was supposed to happen.

1483
02:03:56,618 --> 02:03:59,746
I will enjoy each and every moment
I have with you.

1484
02:04:04,926 --> 02:04:07,394
I bet I can stay out here longer than you.

1485
02:04:07,496 --> 02:04:09,088
I bet you can't.

1486
02:04:11,967 --> 02:04:14,458
Barely a line or a crease.

1487
02:04:14,903 --> 02:04:18,031
Every day I have more wrinkles.
It's not fair.

1488
02:04:19,708 --> 02:04:23,439
I love your wrinkles. Both of them.

1489
02:04:29,151 --> 02:04:31,449
What's it like growing younger?

1490
02:04:33,922 --> 02:04:38,518
I can't really say.
I'm always looking out my own eyes.

1491
02:04:43,565 --> 02:04:47,331
Will you still love me
when my skin grows old and saggy?

1492
02:04:47,436 --> 02:04:51,896
Will you still love me when I have acne?
When I wet the bed?

1493
02:04:53,241 --> 02:04:56,074
When I'm afraid
of what's under the stairs?

1494
02:05:03,552 --> 02:05:04,610
What?

1495
02:05:10,659 --> 02:05:14,618
- What are you thinking?
- Well, I was thinking how nothing lasts.

1496
02:05:17,032 --> 02:05:19,023
And what a shame that is.

1497
02:05:22,037 --> 02:05:23,664
Some things last.

1498
02:05:25,974 --> 02:05:30,172
- Good night, Daisy.
- Good night, Benjamin.

1499
02:05:46,595 --> 02:05:47,653
Mom?

1500
02:05:49,965 --> 02:05:53,958
- When did you meet Dad?
- Some time after that.

1501
02:05:57,138 --> 02:06:01,837
- Did you tell him about this Benjamin?
- He knew enough, darling.

1502
02:06:21,863 --> 02:06:22,955
Mama?

1503
02:06:30,171 --> 02:06:31,399
Queenie?

1504
02:06:34,576 --> 02:06:35,873
Hello?

1505
02:06:36,344 --> 02:06:39,939
Oh, hi, Mrs. Carter, it's Benjamin.
Where is everybody?

1506
02:06:40,048 --> 02:06:45,213
Oh, Benjamin. Queenie died.
I'm so sorry.

1507
02:07:13,915 --> 02:07:17,316
I'm so sorry for your loss.
She was a great woman.

1508
02:07:17,419 --> 02:07:19,216
Our deepest condolences.

1509
02:07:24,392 --> 02:07:27,384
<i>We buried her
beside her beloved Mr. Weathers.</i>

1510
02:07:34,402 --> 02:07:37,860
<i>And so we might have memories
of our own,</i>

1511
02:07:37,973 --> 02:07:39,907
<i>we sold my father's house
on Esplanade.</i>

1512
02:07:40,008 --> 02:07:42,602
It is a wonderful old place, darling.

1513
02:07:43,211 --> 02:07:46,146
I think we are going to be
so happy here.

1514
02:07:46,247 --> 02:07:49,114
Oh, what a long family history you have.

1515
02:07:49,217 --> 02:07:51,208
They come with the house.

1516
02:07:53,822 --> 02:07:56,723
- Come on.
- You have to see the master suite.

1517
02:07:58,259 --> 02:08:00,454
<i>We bought ourselves a duplex.</i>

1518
02:08:02,530 --> 02:08:04,555
I loved that house.

1519
02:08:07,002 --> 02:08:08,970
It smelled like firewood.

1520
02:08:10,105 --> 02:08:13,302
Don't... Don't stop, darling.

1521
02:08:13,942 --> 02:08:16,775
"It was one of the happiest times
of my life. "

1522
02:08:16,878 --> 02:08:19,403
<i>We didn't have a stick of furniture.</i>

1523
02:08:20,215 --> 02:08:22,945
<i>We would have picnics
in the living room.</i>

1524
02:08:26,454 --> 02:08:30,413
<i>We ate when we felt like it.
Stayed up all night when we wanted.</i>

1525
02:08:31,860 --> 02:08:33,828
<i>We vowed never to fall into routine,</i>

1526
02:08:33,928 --> 02:08:36,795
<i>to go to bed or wake up
at the same time.</i>

1527
02:08:36,898 --> 02:08:38,923
<i>We lived on that mattress.</i>

1528
02:09:14,669 --> 02:09:18,127
<i>Our neighbor, a Mrs. Van Dam,
was a physical therapist.</i>

1529
02:09:19,741 --> 02:09:22,471
<i>We lived four blocks from a public pool.</i>

1530
02:10:00,882 --> 02:10:03,646
You know, you might've got
a few more years out of it,

1531
02:10:03,752 --> 02:10:07,848
but you chose to do
something so special and unique

1532
02:10:09,290 --> 02:10:12,987
that there was only
a short window of time you could do it.

1533
02:10:14,829 --> 02:10:17,320
So, even if nothing ever happened,

1534
02:10:17,432 --> 02:10:20,526
you'd still be right here
where you are now.

1535
02:10:20,635 --> 02:10:22,865
I just don't like getting old.

1536
02:10:24,439 --> 02:10:26,930
They put too much chlorine in here.

1537
02:11:08,216 --> 02:11:12,084
I promise you I'll never lose myself
to self-pity again.

1538
02:11:16,457 --> 02:11:19,483
<i>And I think right there and then</i>

1539
02:11:19,594 --> 02:11:23,587
<i>she realized
none of us is perfect forever.</i>

1540
02:11:27,569 --> 02:11:29,161
<i>She found peace.</i>

1541
02:11:31,072 --> 02:11:33,973
<i>She opened a studio
and taught young girls how to dance.</i>

1542
02:11:34,075 --> 02:11:37,169
<i>And tendu.</i>

1543
02:11:37,278 --> 02:11:42,341
Come back the other way.
And spot, spot, spot. Excellent.

1544
02:11:44,052 --> 02:11:46,486
- Good night, Miss Daisy.
- Good night.

1545
02:12:11,980 --> 02:12:14,574
You certainly are beautiful to watch.

1546
02:12:16,417 --> 02:12:18,783
Dancing's all about the line.

1547
02:12:21,089 --> 02:12:22,954
The line of your body.

1548
02:12:24,359 --> 02:12:28,659
Sooner or later, you lose that line,
and you never get it back.

1549
02:12:34,569 --> 02:12:40,508
I figure, you were born in 1918,
49 years ago.

1550
02:12:40,608 --> 02:12:42,098
I'm 43.

1551
02:12:44,312 --> 02:12:46,837
We are almost the same age.

1552
02:12:50,151 --> 02:12:54,315
- We're meeting in the middle.
- We finally caught up with each other.

1553
02:12:55,523 --> 02:12:56,615
Wait.

1554
02:12:57,992 --> 02:13:00,620
I want to remember us
just as we are now.

1555
02:13:11,506 --> 02:13:12,973
I'm pregnant.

1556
02:13:30,692 --> 02:13:34,321
You know, I swear the nurse slipped
and said it was a boy.

1557
02:13:49,344 --> 02:13:51,312
But I think it's a girl.

1558
02:13:56,651 --> 02:14:00,212
- I know you're afraid.
- I'm not hiding it.

1559
02:14:00,321 --> 02:14:01,413
Okay.

1560
02:14:08,763 --> 02:14:10,059
- What's your worst fear?
- Baby born like me.

1561
02:14:10,094 --> 02:14:11,355
- What's your worst fear?
- Baby born like me.

1562
02:14:11,466 --> 02:14:13,866
Then I will love it all the more.

1563
02:14:15,903 --> 02:14:20,840
Okay. How can I be a father
when I'm heading in the other direction?

1564
02:14:21,509 --> 02:14:24,808
It's not fair to a child.
I don't want to be anybody's burden.

1565
02:14:24,912 --> 02:14:27,745
Sugar, we all end up in diapers.

1566
02:14:29,250 --> 02:14:31,275
I am gonna make this work.

1567
02:14:33,955 --> 02:14:36,856
I want this, and I want it with you.

1568
02:14:36,958 --> 02:14:40,359
I want you to have everything you want,
all of it.

1569
02:14:40,461 --> 02:14:43,658
I'm just not sure how to reconcile this.

1570
02:14:43,765 --> 02:14:45,824
Would you tell a blind man
he couldn't have children?

1571
02:14:45,933 --> 02:14:47,491
Here you go.

1572
02:14:47,602 --> 02:14:51,038
You'll be a father for as long as you can.

1573
02:14:51,139 --> 02:14:53,937
I know the consequences.
I've accepted that.

1574
02:14:54,042 --> 02:14:56,602
Loving you is worth everything to me.

1575
02:15:01,182 --> 02:15:02,809
I have to go pee.

1576
02:15:16,898 --> 02:15:19,128
<i>The oldest woman
to ever swim the English Channel</i>

1577
02:15:19,233 --> 02:15:20,962
<i>arrived here today in Calais...</i>

1578
02:15:21,069 --> 02:15:23,537
<i>- Keep it.
- ... having made the swim in 34 hours,</i>

1579
02:15:23,638 --> 02:15:25,833
<i>22 minutes and 14 seconds.</i>

1580
02:15:25,940 --> 02:15:30,775
<i>The 68-year-old Elizabeth Abbott
arrived at 5:38 Greenwich mean time,</i>

1581
02:15:30,878 --> 02:15:32,641
<i>exhausted but happy.</i>

1582
02:15:32,747 --> 02:15:36,274
<i>Miss Abbott, how would you sum up,
in words, this achievement?</i>

1583
02:15:36,384 --> 02:15:37,942
<i>I suppose...</i>

1584
02:15:39,353 --> 02:15:41,082
<i>Anything's possible.</i>

1585
02:15:45,126 --> 02:15:46,286
<i>- All right?
- Yes. Thank you.</i>

1586
02:15:46,394 --> 02:15:47,361
<i>- You ready?
- Thank you very much.</i>

1587
02:15:47,462 --> 02:15:49,396
<i>Thank you. Thank you all.</i>

1588
02:15:49,497 --> 02:15:51,465
<i>- Yeah.
- You're very kind.</i>

1589
02:15:58,706 --> 02:16:02,574
<i>In the spring, on a day like any other...</i>

1590
02:16:03,344 --> 02:16:05,312
I'll be back in an hour!

1591
02:16:10,351 --> 02:16:11,511
Honey?

1592
02:16:13,621 --> 02:16:15,612
Go and call an ambulance!

1593
02:16:18,559 --> 02:16:20,220
The baby's coming.

1594
02:16:21,062 --> 02:16:22,086
Operator, I need an ambulance.

1595
02:16:22,196 --> 02:16:24,630
- The baby's coming!
-2714 Napoleon.

1596
02:16:31,873 --> 02:16:34,535
There you go. Keep breathing.

1597
02:16:35,476 --> 02:16:37,842
Deep breaths. Push.

1598
02:16:47,755 --> 02:16:49,154
There we go.

1599
02:17:05,573 --> 02:17:08,906
Everyone's fine.
She's a perfectly healthy baby girl.

1600
02:17:15,850 --> 02:17:17,010
Honey?

1601
02:17:18,986 --> 02:17:22,581
<i>She gave birth to a five pound,
four ounce baby girl.</i>

1602
02:17:38,806 --> 02:17:40,706
Did you count the toes?

1603
02:17:45,046 --> 02:17:46,536
She's perfect.

1604
02:17:46,981 --> 02:17:50,246
"And we named her
for my mother, Caroline. "

1605
02:17:53,988 --> 02:17:56,115
This Benjamin was my father?

1606
02:17:57,658 --> 02:17:59,785
And this is how you tell me?

1607
02:18:05,399 --> 02:18:06,730
Excuse me.

1608
02:18:17,245 --> 02:18:19,975
<i>...because all the ingredients are there
for a major storm,</i>

1609
02:18:20,081 --> 02:18:22,606
<i>possibly even up to a Category 5.</i>

1610
02:18:29,390 --> 02:18:33,053
Hey, I know it's hard.
You can't smoke in here.

1611
02:18:36,297 --> 02:18:38,629
<i>Nobody can tell you exactly
where it's gonna hit,</i>

1612
02:18:38,733 --> 02:18:40,530
<i>but we have to go with the guidance
that we have,</i>

1613
02:18:40,635 --> 02:18:44,332
<i>incorporate that information
and then pass it along to you.</i>

1614
02:18:51,212 --> 02:18:56,047
"You grew as the doctor had promised,
normal and healthy. "

1615
02:19:04,725 --> 02:19:07,819
You're gonna have to find a real father
for her.

1616
02:19:10,998 --> 02:19:12,761
What are you talking about?

1617
02:19:12,867 --> 02:19:16,132
She's gonna need someone
to grow old with.

1618
02:19:16,237 --> 02:19:19,070
She'll learn to accept
whatever happens. She loves you.

1619
02:19:19,173 --> 02:19:21,903
Honey, she needs a father,
not a playmate.

1620
02:19:26,047 --> 02:19:27,344
- Is it me?
- Of course not.

1621
02:19:27,448 --> 02:19:29,416
- Is my age beginning to bother you?
- Of course not.

1622
02:19:29,517 --> 02:19:33,510
- Is that what you're telling me?
- You can't raise the both of us.

1623
02:19:42,196 --> 02:19:47,099
<i>It was your first birthday.
We had a party for you.</i>

1624
02:19:47,868 --> 02:19:49,699
<i>The house was filled with children.</i>

1625
02:19:49,804 --> 02:19:51,738
- How are you?
- Hey, man.

1626
02:19:51,839 --> 02:19:55,468
Before you turn around,
they'll be in high school, dating.

1627
02:20:27,908 --> 02:20:31,901
<i>I sold the summer house
on Lake Pontchartrain,</i>

1628
02:20:32,012 --> 02:20:34,708
<i>I sold Button's Buttons,</i>

1629
02:20:34,815 --> 02:20:39,343
<i>I sold my father's sailboat,
put it all into a savings account.</i>

1630
02:20:41,622 --> 02:20:44,819
<i>And so that you
and your mother might have a life,</i>

1631
02:20:46,060 --> 02:20:49,962
<i>I left,
before you could ever remember me.</i>

1632
02:21:39,680 --> 02:21:41,773
"I left with just the clothes on my back. "

1633
02:21:43,250 --> 02:21:47,880
I don't want to read this now.
Can you just tell me where he went?

1634
02:21:49,356 --> 02:21:51,586
I don't really know.

1635
02:22:02,870 --> 02:22:07,807
It's for me. 1970. I was two.
"Happy Birthday.

1636
02:22:10,611 --> 02:22:13,444
"I wish
I could have kissed you good night. "

1637
02:22:18,552 --> 02:22:20,281
They're all for me.

1638
02:22:21,322 --> 02:22:26,282
Five. "I wish I could have taken you
to your first day of school. "

1639
02:22:30,831 --> 02:22:36,667
Six. "I wish I could have been there
to teach you to play piano. "

1640
02:22:40,140 --> 02:22:43,075
1981, 13.

1641
02:22:43,177 --> 02:22:46,476
"I wish I could have told you
not to chase some boy.

1642
02:22:47,815 --> 02:22:51,444
"I wish I could have held you
when you had a broken heart.

1643
02:22:52,953 --> 02:22:58,721
"I wish I could have been your father.
Nothing I ever did will replace that. "

1644
02:23:06,233 --> 02:23:08,758
I guess he went to India.

1645
02:23:08,869 --> 02:23:11,303
"For what it's worth, it's never too late,

1646
02:23:11,405 --> 02:23:13,202
<i>- "or, in my case, too early... "
- ... or, in my case, too early,</i>

1647
02:23:14,475 --> 02:23:16,443
<i>to be whoever you want to be.</i>

1648
02:23:20,514 --> 02:23:23,176
<i>There's no time limit.
Start whenever you want.</i>

1649
02:23:26,086 --> 02:23:30,546
<i>You can change or stay the same.
There are no rules to this thing.</i>

1650
02:23:33,127 --> 02:23:36,619
<i>We can make the best or the worst of it.</i>

1651
02:23:36,730 --> 02:23:39,028
<i>And I hope you make the best of it.</i>

1652
02:23:42,136 --> 02:23:44,832
<i>I hope you see things that startle you.</i>

1653
02:23:47,007 --> 02:23:50,499
<i>I hope you feel things
you never felt before.</i>

1654
02:23:52,980 --> 02:23:56,472
<i>I hope you meet people
with a different point of view.</i>

1655
02:23:57,651 --> 02:24:00,347
<i>I hope you live a life you're proud of.</i>

1656
02:24:03,357 --> 02:24:08,385
<i>And if you find that you're not,
I hope you have the strength</i>

1657
02:24:08,495 --> 02:24:11,692
<i>- to start all over again.
- "... start all over again. "</i>

1658
02:24:13,267 --> 02:24:16,964
He had been gone a long time.

1659
02:24:18,772 --> 02:24:20,865
I'll see you next Thursday.

1660
02:24:23,844 --> 02:24:27,211
- Good night, Miss Daisy.
- Oh, good night, sweetheart.

1661
02:24:45,065 --> 02:24:47,056
I'm sorry, we're closing.

1662
02:24:50,004 --> 02:24:51,528
Can I help you?

1663
02:24:53,140 --> 02:24:55,540
Are you here to pick somebody up?

1664
02:25:05,919 --> 02:25:07,784
Why did you come back?

1665
02:25:09,390 --> 02:25:10,652
Mom?

1666
02:25:11,725 --> 02:25:12,783
Mom?

1667
02:25:14,028 --> 02:25:15,518
You ready yet?

1668
02:25:18,532 --> 02:25:19,624
Mom, what's wrong?

1669
02:25:19,733 --> 02:25:23,294
I was just hearing a very sad story
about a mutual friend

1670
02:25:23,404 --> 02:25:26,100
who I hadn't seen for a very long time.

1671
02:25:27,374 --> 02:25:30,104
Caroline, this is Benjamin.

1672
02:25:30,210 --> 02:25:32,906
You knew him
when you were just a baby.

1673
02:25:35,382 --> 02:25:36,610
- Hi.
- Hi.

1674
02:25:38,552 --> 02:25:40,417
Hey.

1675
02:25:42,423 --> 02:25:47,258
- Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were done.
- Oh, this is a friend of my family's.

1676
02:25:47,361 --> 02:25:52,298
Benjamin Button,
this is my husband, Robert.

1677
02:25:52,399 --> 02:25:54,799
- How do you do?
- A pleasure.

1678
02:26:02,943 --> 02:26:05,935
Well, it was very nice to meet you.

1679
02:26:06,046 --> 02:26:07,843
- We'll be in the car, darling.
- All right.

1680
02:26:07,948 --> 02:26:09,074
Bye.

1681
02:26:09,817 --> 02:26:11,580
I'm just locking up.

1682
02:26:16,356 --> 02:26:17,414
Wow.

1683
02:26:19,960 --> 02:26:22,827
She's beautiful. Like her mother.

1684
02:26:24,431 --> 02:26:26,899
- Does she dance?
- Not very well.

1685
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:28,900
I guess that'd be
from my side of things.

1686
02:26:29,002 --> 02:26:30,993
She's a dear, sweet girl.

1687
02:26:32,206 --> 02:26:36,540
She seems a little lost.
But then, who isn't at 12?

1688
02:26:36,744 --> 02:26:40,976
A lot of her reminds me of you.

1689
02:26:41,882 --> 02:26:45,818
My husband, he's a widower, or was...
Was a widower.

1690
02:26:46,220 --> 02:26:50,122
He's an incredibly kind, just bright,
adventurous man.

1691
02:26:53,293 --> 02:26:55,989
- He's been a terrific father.
- Good.

1692
02:27:00,701 --> 02:27:04,603
- You are so much younger.
- Only on the outside.

1693
02:27:06,707 --> 02:27:08,231
You were right.

1694
02:27:10,010 --> 02:27:13,377
I couldn't have been raising both of you.

1695
02:27:13,480 --> 02:27:15,243
I'm not that strong.

1696
02:27:19,453 --> 02:27:21,478
So, where are you staying?

1697
02:27:24,158 --> 02:27:25,147
What are you gonna do?

1698
02:27:25,259 --> 02:27:29,059
I'm staying at the Pontchartrain Hotel
on the Avenue.

1699
02:27:29,163 --> 02:27:32,690
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1700
02:27:32,800 --> 02:27:33,960
But...

1701
02:27:40,474 --> 02:27:42,101
They're waiting.

1702
02:28:24,251 --> 02:28:27,516
I remember that. That was him?

1703
02:28:30,190 --> 02:28:31,350
The hurricane has changed directions.

1704
02:28:31,458 --> 02:28:33,289
It's going to make landfall
sometime soon.

1705
02:28:33,393 --> 02:28:35,122
- Am I supposed to do something?
- Arrangements are being made

1706
02:28:35,229 --> 02:28:36,457
to move people, but it's up to you.

1707
02:28:36,563 --> 02:28:38,428
No. No, we're... We're staying.

1708
02:28:38,532 --> 02:28:41,160
I'll let you know if anything changes.

1709
02:28:43,203 --> 02:28:47,537
"That night, while I was sitting
and wondering why I came back at all,

1710
02:28:47,641 --> 02:28:49,973
"there was a knock at the door. "

1711
02:28:53,614 --> 02:28:54,842
Come in.

1712
02:29:09,162 --> 02:29:10,823
Are you all right?

1713
02:29:13,934 --> 02:29:18,030
I'm sorry,
I don't know what I'm doing here.

1714
02:29:27,080 --> 02:29:28,570
Nothing lasts.

1715
02:29:32,052 --> 02:29:34,384
I have never stopped loving you.

1716
02:29:40,394 --> 02:29:43,090
Oh, but, Benjamin,
I'm an old woman now.

1717
02:29:53,740 --> 02:29:55,935
Some things you never forget.

1718
02:30:16,229 --> 02:30:17,287
<i>...so few people even know</i>

1719
02:30:17,397 --> 02:30:19,092
<i>that you were ever in jail
in the first place.</i>

1720
02:30:19,199 --> 02:30:21,394
<i>I'll tell you, I am sick about it, too,</i>

1721
02:30:21,501 --> 02:30:24,061
<i>because, please,
if they're not gonna give you an award</i>

1722
02:30:24,171 --> 02:30:26,230
<i>like "Man of the Year,"
at least what they could do</i>

1723
02:30:26,340 --> 02:30:29,002
<i>is stop having you listed
as an ex-convict</i>

1724
02:30:29,109 --> 02:30:31,600
<i>which I think is, again, so unfair.</i>

1725
02:30:44,391 --> 02:30:46,188
Good night, Benjamin.

1726
02:30:47,728 --> 02:30:49,389
Good night, Daisy.

1727
02:30:52,599 --> 02:30:56,831
<i>And as I knew I would,
I watched her go.</i>

1728
02:30:59,573 --> 02:31:01,871
That's the last thing he wrote.

1729
02:31:03,043 --> 02:31:07,605
Sometime after your father passed,

1730
02:31:07,714 --> 02:31:10,547
there was a call.

1731
02:31:13,620 --> 02:31:14,780
Hello.

1732
02:31:15,889 --> 02:31:17,379
Yes, speaking.

1733
02:31:20,727 --> 02:31:23,218
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

1734
02:31:33,073 --> 02:31:34,938
It's the corner house.

1735
02:31:57,130 --> 02:31:58,495
Come on in.

1736
02:32:04,104 --> 02:32:06,129
- I'm Daisy Fuller.
- I'm David Hernandez,

1737
02:32:06,239 --> 02:32:09,936
with the Orleans Parish Department
of Child Welfare Services.

1738
02:32:10,043 --> 02:32:12,671
He was living in a condemned building.

1739
02:32:14,481 --> 02:32:16,779
The police found this with him.

1740
02:32:16,883 --> 02:32:19,818
This address.
It's got your name in it a lot.

1741
02:32:21,021 --> 02:32:23,649
He's in very poor health.
He was taken to the hospital.

1742
02:32:23,757 --> 02:32:27,784
He doesn't seem to know who
or where he is. He's very confused.

1743
02:32:27,894 --> 02:32:31,455
I was telling Mr. Hernandez
that Benjamin is one of us.

1744
02:32:31,565 --> 02:32:35,399
If he needs a place to stay,
it's all right, he can stay here.

1745
02:33:04,865 --> 02:33:06,127
Benjamin?

1746
02:33:10,003 --> 02:33:11,800
You play beautifully.

1747
02:33:15,308 --> 02:33:17,139
He doesn't seem to like to be touched.

1748
02:33:17,244 --> 02:33:18,905
He goes in and out
of states of recognition.

1749
02:33:19,012 --> 02:33:20,639
The doctors say,
if they didn't know any better,

1750
02:33:20,747 --> 02:33:23,181
he has the beginnings of dementia.

1751
02:33:24,985 --> 02:33:26,714
Do you remember me?

1752
02:33:29,890 --> 02:33:31,221
I'm Daisy.

1753
02:33:33,827 --> 02:33:35,294
I'm Benjamin.

1754
02:33:41,001 --> 02:33:43,663
It's nice to meet you, Benjamin.

1755
02:33:45,372 --> 02:33:50,742
Would you mind if I sit with you?
I would love to hear you play.

1756
02:33:54,614 --> 02:33:56,104
Do I know you?

1757
02:34:01,087 --> 02:34:02,714
<i>- I want some breakfast.
- And every day,</i>

1758
02:34:02,822 --> 02:34:06,781
<i>I would stop by to make sure
that he was comfortable.</i>

1759
02:34:06,893 --> 02:34:09,521
- No, I didn't.
- You just finished eating.

1760
02:34:09,629 --> 02:34:11,961
Don't think I don't know
what you're doing!

1761
02:34:12,065 --> 02:34:14,795
You're all fucking liars!

1762
02:34:14,901 --> 02:34:17,826
He doesn't believe
he just had his breakfast.

1763
02:34:19,139 --> 02:34:22,768
Now, why don't we see

1764
02:34:22,876 --> 02:34:26,243
if we can't find something else
for you to do?

1765
02:34:26,413 --> 02:34:29,576
I have a feeling
there's a lot of things I can't remember.

1766
02:34:29,683 --> 02:34:31,583
Well, like what, sugar?

1767
02:34:32,852 --> 02:34:36,845
It's like there's this whole life I had,

1768
02:34:38,325 --> 02:34:40,725
and I can't remember what it was.

1769
02:34:43,530 --> 02:34:44,861
It's okay.

1770
02:34:46,967 --> 02:34:48,434
It's okay to forget things.

1771
02:34:48,668 --> 02:34:54,231
<i>Many times, he would simply forget
who or where he was.</i>

1772
02:34:54,574 --> 02:34:56,235
There he is, he's up there on the roof.

1773
02:34:56,343 --> 02:34:58,038
<i>It wasn't easy.</i>

1774
02:34:58,144 --> 02:35:00,374
- Benjamin!
- I can see everything!

1775
02:35:00,480 --> 02:35:02,243
- I can see the big river!
- That's right,

1776
02:35:02,349 --> 02:35:04,078
you can see everything, sweetheart.

1777
02:35:04,184 --> 02:35:06,175
I can see the graveyard
where Mama's buried,

1778
02:35:06,286 --> 02:35:09,653
- and all those other people.
- I want you to come down!

1779
02:35:09,756 --> 02:35:13,487
- What if I could fly?
- I knew a man who could fly.

1780
02:35:14,494 --> 02:35:17,463
You come down
and I'll tell you all about him.

1781
02:35:21,034 --> 02:35:22,626
Somebody go up there.

1782
02:35:29,242 --> 02:35:32,211
<i>He was five when I moved in.</i>

1783
02:35:32,312 --> 02:35:36,772
<i>Nearly the same age I was
when I had met him.</i>

1784
02:35:42,789 --> 02:35:46,725
"This is the picture
of Old Man Kangaroo

1785
02:35:46,826 --> 02:35:49,260
"at 5:00 in the afternoon

1786
02:35:49,362 --> 02:35:52,820
"when he had got
his beautiful hind legs. "

1787
02:35:54,067 --> 02:35:55,364
<i>The days passed.</i>

1788
02:35:55,468 --> 02:35:59,700
<i>And I watched as he forgot how to walk</i>

1789
02:36:04,944 --> 02:36:07,378
<i>- and how to talk.
- What's my name?</i>

1790
02:36:07,847 --> 02:36:09,178
I'm Daisy.

1791
02:36:10,350 --> 02:36:12,113
Can you say "Daisy"?

1792
02:36:13,687 --> 02:36:18,954
<i>In 2002, they put up a new clock
in that train station.</i>

1793
02:36:25,799 --> 02:36:29,565
<i>And in the spring of 2003,</i>

1794
02:36:33,940 --> 02:36:35,601
<i>he looked at me</i>

1795
02:36:38,111 --> 02:36:43,174
<i>and I knew that he knew who I was.</i>

1796
02:36:46,720 --> 02:36:52,522
<i>And then he closed his eyes
as if to go to sleep.</i>

1797
02:37:25,091 --> 02:37:29,255
- I wish I'd known him.
- Now you do.

1798
02:37:33,767 --> 02:37:37,533
Mom, I think I should go see
what's going on.

1799
02:37:44,577 --> 02:37:46,602
Good night, Benjamin.

1800
02:38:09,002 --> 02:38:11,368
<i>We're expecting flash flooding
after the levee break.</i>

1801
02:38:11,471 --> 02:38:13,701
<i>It occurred in the Ninth Ward.</i>

1802
02:38:16,743 --> 02:38:19,576
<i>Some people are born to sit by a river.</i>

1803
02:38:21,114 --> 02:38:23,048
<i>Some get struck by lightning.</i>

1804
02:38:24,951 --> 02:38:27,044
<i>Some have an ear for music.</i>

1805
02:38:28,655 --> 02:38:30,282
<i>Some are artists.</i>

1806
02:38:31,624 --> 02:38:32,955
<i>Some swim.</i>

1807
02:38:34,394 --> 02:38:36,021
<i>Some know buttons.</i>

1808
02:38:37,831 --> 02:38:39,196
<i>Some know Shakespeare.</i>

1809
02:38:40,366 --> 02:38:42,129
<i>Some are mothers.</i>

1810
02:38:44,103 --> 02:38:47,129
<i>And some people dance.</i>
