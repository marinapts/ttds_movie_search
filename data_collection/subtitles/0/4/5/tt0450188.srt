00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,000
<i>New York,</i>
<i>February 16, 1959</i>

2
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,720
Hurry! She collapsed 10 minutes ago.

3
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,560
The ambulance is on its way.

4
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,800
<i>Saint Theresa, dear God,</i>
<i>do not forsake me</i>...

5
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,320
<i>...give me strength. I want to live.</i>
<i>Restore me to life.</i>

6
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,200
Paris, Belleville, 1918

7
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,040
Why are you crying?
-Get the hell out of here, scum!

8
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,560
<i>I'm so lonely and miserable.</i>
<i>Life is so hard.</i>

9
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,480
<i>But it's all I know.</i>
<i>What more can I say?</i>

10
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,520
What are you doing here?

11
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,000
Why are you crying?
Are you on your own?

12
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,480
Where's your mother?

13
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:06,320
<i>Wherever I go,</i>
<i>in chains,</i>

14
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:12,200
<i>There is nothing but pain.</i>
<i>Nothing to accomplish.</i>

15
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:18,800
<i>My life is so hard.</i>
<i>I've known nothing else,</i>

16
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,520
<i>I'm all alone and miserable.</i>

17
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,440
A fine mother YOU are!
Hanging's too good for you!

18
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,320
I have to live too. I'm a singer!
-She should be looking after your daughter!

19
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,360
I look after her very well!

20
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:46,200
<i>Louis, I can no longer wait here for you.</i>
<i>Belleville is horrible.</i>

21
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,360
<i>My agent says that someone with my talent</i>
<i>should go to Constantinople...</i>

22
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,160
<i>...just like Frehel the singer...</i>

23
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,680
Good news for our acrobat?

24
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,960
Sure, and Clemenceau sends his regards.

25
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,400
<i>I left Edith with my mother.</i>

26
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,880
<i>She'll take care of her</i>
<i>till I'm on my feet again.</i>

27
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,720
<i>Louis, I can't wait for you any longer.</i>

28
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,320
<i>Anetta.</i>

29
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,720
Anybody home?

30
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,960
Edith?

31
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,360
Louis?

32
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,560
I'm taking her with me.

33
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,200
Bernay, Normandy, 1918

34
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,000
And who's this?

35
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,320
Your granddaughter: Edith.

36
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,240
That's a peculiar name.

37
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,840
She's a sickly looking child.

38
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,120
Come with me.

39
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,920
What are you doing here?

40
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,200
What a angel!
What's your name?

41
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,720
Back to work, Titine!
-There's someone in the toilet upstairs.

42
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,440
What lovely blue eyes you have.

43
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,160
I'm listening...

44
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,920
I have to be getting back.

45
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,800
I'll be demobbed soon.
Then I can work as an acrobat again.

46
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,440
I'll return for my little angel.
-Not now!

47
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm finished, Mama Louise.
-Watch the door.

48
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,480
Where's her mother?

49
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,320
No idea.

50
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,400
Would you want her to stay here?

51
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,600
People will talk.
-People always talk.

52
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,440
Isn't she going with us to Mass?

53
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,640
We'll be late for Mass.
-The world doesn't revolve around her.

54
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,200
It appears we have a baby.
-May we see her?

55
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,360
It's a little girl. Would she like some bread?
-All right, everybody leave, please.

56
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,000
Come on, ask her if she'll sing for us.

57
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,160
A shame that communists aren't allowed on the stage.

58
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,480
<i>One night I went swimming</i>
<i>in my birthday suit,</i>

59
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,520
<i>Nobody could see me,</i>
<i>Only the night itself.</i>

60
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,160
<i>Until the moon suddenly appeared,</i>
<i>I felt like saying: shine on me.</i>

61
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,920
<i>Then I heard close by</i>

62
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,040
<i>A heartfelt cry.</i>

63
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,080
<i>A man stood on a rock,</i>
<i>Low enough to see me.</i>

64
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,200
<i>The man cried "Oh!"</i>

65
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,760
<i>And from the water,</i>
<i>I cried "oh" back.</i>

66
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,240
<i>He saw me naked,</i>

67
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:13,760
<i>Nothing to cover me,</i>
<i>I blushed the whole night long.</i>

68
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:19,800
<i>He saw me naked,</i>
<i>Completely naked.</i>

69
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,840
<i>Out of respect for the poor man,</i>
<i>I covered up my face.</i>

70
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:31,720
<i>But now I know</i>
<i>that by doing so</i>

71
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:38,480
<i>I ended up showing</i>
<i>my charms below.</i>

72
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,160
<i>He saw me naked.</i>

73
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,160
Titine! Open the door.
That's enough now.

74
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,040
What's the matter?
- She has Edith with her.

75
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,920
Open up I say!
-Whatever is the matter?

76
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,720
Nothing. Get a move on.
The customers will be here any minute.

77
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,080
Open the door! Otherwise I'll...
-I don't want to work.

78
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,760
I don't want to work.
-Oh, you don't want to work?

79
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:29,760
What do you think this is, a hotel?
-Edith is staying here with me tonight.

80
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,680
That's what YOU think.

81
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,720
It's me. Open this door.
The soldier is here.

82
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:41,480
<i>I couldn't care less.</i> 
<i>That liar with his lies and alibis.</i>

83
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:47,280
<i>Stop your nonsense and get yourself out here.</i>
<i>Otherwise it's the street for you.</i>

84
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,560
I'm tired of you playing the drama queen!

85
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,240
I don't want any nonsense.

86
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,040
New York, May 8, 1959

87
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,520
Doug!

88
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,200
What, are you jealous?

89
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,560
I'll send the Billie Holiday records
to the hotel.

90
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:41,240
<i>Thank you, Loulou. Billie and I were born the same year.</i> 
<i>Is that not something?</i>

91
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,720
I've brought my drawings.

92
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,680
You want to see them now, or later?

93
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,160
Later. First I have to sing that shmuck's song.

94
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,600
That's before your time...
-What?

95
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,560
Nothing.

96
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,560
I'm ready.

97
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,320
I'm ready.

98
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,760
That's Jeanne!

99
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,920
What's the matter?

100
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,720
Blood everywhere...
-Tell me about it!

101
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,680
<i>He wanted to play doctors and patients,</i>
<i>with my instruments.</i>

102
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,320
The filthy swine!

103
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,720
Titine!

104
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,600
We'll have to tell Madame.
-She'll kill me. It hurts!

105
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,600
I can't see anything.

106
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,760
Well, doctor?
-It's not good I'm afraid.

107
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,840
It's her cornea.

108
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,200
Is she blind?

109
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,960
It's an infection.

110
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,280
Patience. This sort of thing can last for months.

111
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,840
Take this to the pharmacist.

112
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,440
My thanks.

113
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,040
Whose child is she?

114
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,760
Nobody's.

115
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,920
Lisieux, Normandy

116
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:48,240
<i>Theresa, I never ask anything of you.</i>
<i>But I'm asking you to listen to little Edith.</i>

117
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,240
Please, Edith.
Say it. She's listening.

118
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,840
Theresa, I don't want to be blind.
I want to see.

119
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,440
She bumps into everything.
Go on.

120
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:06,480
<i>I want to learn how to read, and to run like I used to.
I don't want to be blind.</i>

121
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:10,560
Saint Theresa, please ask baby Jesus
to take care of Edith.

122
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,920
Go on.

123
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,320
Thank you, Saint Theresa, Jesus.
-Thank you.

124
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,040
She can see...

125
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,640
She can see!

126
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,320
Titine, get up!

127
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,960
Whatis it?
-He's back. He's come for Edith.

128
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,680
Get dressed.

129
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,880
They can't do this to me!

130
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,880
How can you keep on doing this?

131
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,800
She'll see a lot of the world.

132
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,960
Go!

133
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,200
Edith!

134
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,920
Titine!

135
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,280
Don't take my little girl away.

136
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,320
Let her go!

137
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,360
Enough!

138
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,160
She's crazy!

139
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,680
Stop or I'll throw you out!

140
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,960
You've no right!

141
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,160
Don't do this to me!
-Go!

142
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,520
It's over! I'm ending it all.

143
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,880
Here we are at Orly airport.
The passengers are disembarking...

144
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,560
...I see Edith Piaf!
With a young man in tow.

145
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,160
What have you brought back from America?
-An American.

146
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,000
What's his name?

147
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,400
Edith, for God's sake!

148
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,240
Just as in her song, she's carried
<i>'</i>by the crowd.<i>'</i>.

149
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,640
She's stepping into her amazing 
black-and-white automobile.

150
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,960
She looks exhausted, but she's dazzling all the same.

151
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,720
Quiet, please! I wish to propose a toast ...

152
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,240
You're drunk!

153
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,400
You're one to talk!

154
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,840
Help the invalid.

155
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,080
Look out, accordion player, or I'll get you.

156
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,080
Perfect timing.

157
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,520
Get the manager.
I demand champagne on the house.

158
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,880
I'm Edith Piaf,
and I've made a mess of things.

159
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,720
Kiss one another! Even those who don't like each other!
<i>Kiss me, Claude.</i>

160
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,720
.

161
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,520
Who's that slapper?
-No idea.

162
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,080
The spicy beef tartare?
-Where's your handsome friend?

163
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,560
Don't embarrass her...
-Cool it. Who asked you?

164
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,840
Miss?

165
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,360
Miss Piaf, what an honour!
What can I do for you?

166
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,320
A lot. I'd like a present.
-But of course.

167
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,040
I wanted champagne, but I prefer a ring...

168
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,000
...a large ring studded with diamonds.

169
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,520
Don't bother. We'll have the champagne.

170
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,480
Here's to the love I feel for all of you...

171
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,440
...for which I stand. Help me up, someone.

172
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,360
A toast to Marguerite.

173
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,480
My composer and most loyal friend in the business.

174
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,640
Oh,don't blush so.You're making us weep.

175
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,640
What about a photograph?
-I don't think so.

176
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,160
Bubbles and alcohol, perfect!
That's Claude's doing.

177
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:11,360
<i>You're such a bore, Loulou.</i>
<i>We've just returned to Paris, and we're having fun.</i>

178
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,200
Stop playing the unhappy lover.

179
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,600
I'm waiting for someone.

180
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:28,120
Don't forget you've responsibilities.
There's more than you.

181
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,800
Remember the first night in Gerney
<i>'</i>s?

182
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,120
I looked like a bag lady.
You thought I was a princess.

183
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,200
You WERE a princess.
<i>My</i> princess!

184
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,520
To Marguerite.

185
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,080
To all those who wished
to see me come a cropper.

186
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,320
They think I don't know!
Cheers!

187
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,960
What's the matter, Louis?
-He's in bad form.

188
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,240
Go away. We're busy.

189
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,440
You're not here as decoration.
Get to work.

190
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,840
To work, you.
This is no child's play.

191
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,880
You'll earn your keep. Enough!

192
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,280
Stupid child!
You're in everyone's way!

193
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:50,000
Go to the trailer.
See to the meal.

194
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:55,920
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it
for Louis, the Human Snake!

195
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,600
What a little angel.

196
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,600
How old is she?
-Ten.

197
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,360
No mother?

198
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:48,960
What do you mean?

199
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,920
You be so lonely.

200
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,840
What about a calvados
in your trailer?

201
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,880
Let's go.

202
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,800
<i>Do you know who I am?</i>

203
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,320
<i>I'm Theresa.</i>

204
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,000
<i>Are your eyes all right, sweetheart?</i>

205
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,200
Yes.

206
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,000
<i>You're so adorable.</i>
<i>Whom do wish to pray for?</i>

207
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,000
I want to pray for Titine.

208
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:10,040
<i>Very well. I shall look after you.</i>

209
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,600
<i>Never forget that.</i>

210
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,240
<i>Whenever you feel lonely,</i>
<i>remember I'm always here.</i>

211
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,560
Right, that's it!
You were supposed to change that wheel.

212
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,200
We're all in the same rotten boat!

213
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,840
I don't care!
-No? Then screw you!

214
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,960
You shouldn't let 
that kind of thing get you down!

215
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,720
I can't stand Caroli!

216
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,040
You're drunk.
-I'm going solo.

217
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,960
Fat chance of that!
There aren't that many circuses.

218
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,840
I'll manage.

219
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,760
Just when I was getting used to you.
-You'll do okay without me!

220
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:16,280
Saint Theresa, please make him change his mind.
I don't want to leave the circus.

221
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,520
He's completely messed up.

222
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,240
Is the girl part of the act?

223
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,720
Hold on.
Do something.

224
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,840
Before they go, do something.

225
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,640
Come on, do something.

226
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,640
Bravo!

227
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,760
That's my daughter!

228
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,200
Grasse. October 1963

229
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:48,600
I'm sick of this carrot juice.
-You'll drink it as long as I'm nursing you.

230
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:57,200
I like it dark.
-The sun will do you good.

231
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,200
It's hard I know,
but you need a lot of rest...

232
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,880
...and patience.

233
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,800
Your husband phoned today...
-No point.

234
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:27,080
What bothers me 
is that I exaggerated.

235
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,200
The past 3 years were awful.

236
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,080
You're a performer.

237
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,280
Simone?

238
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:47,040
I suppose I'll never sing again?

239
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,560
Paris, Montmartre.
October 1935

240
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,560
What's up with you?

241
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,600
I'm hungry.

242
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,800
First we sing, then we eat.

243
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,200
Sing alone and you're a beggar.
When you're a duo it's a show.

244
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,040
I want to sing here.

245
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,360
Hey, you!

246
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,240
No street singing allowed.

247
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,000
Is that a fact?

248
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,000
How old are you?
-Twenty.

249
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,760
What's that?

250
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,960
She's had hardly anything to drink.
-Come here.

251
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,720
Do you know <i>'</i>Du Gris<i>'</i>?

252
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,440
Oh, sir...
-Shut up!

253
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,920
If you sing that,I'll let you go.
That's my beat.I'll look the other way.

254
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,320
Next week it's our 21st.
Sisters for 5 years.

255
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:13,080
What do you prefer, working with me
or in the factory?

256
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,680
I'd rather cut my own throat.
How about you?

257
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,320
What do you mean?

258
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,720
Killing yourself in your little milk shop?
-Shut up! Not while we're eating.

259
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,680
Anetta, no moaning, okay?

260
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,440
Look, it's your drunken mother.

261
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,280
Edith?

262
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,400
Do you have any change?

263
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:52,840
That's all?
-I haven't much money.

264
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,560
Give me some bank notes.
-I don't have any.

265
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,640
I'm your mother.
-Go to hell!

266
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,440
Shall I sing a song?
-Throw her out!

267
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,800
I'm a performer. What about you?

268
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,160
You'll find out!

269
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,480
What'll I find out?
-When you're lying in the gutter.

270
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:20,880
Keep it down or leave!
-When you're in need...

271
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,360
Fuck off!

272
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,240
...don't depend on your daughter 
giving you a bite to eat.

273
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,480
That's enough.
-I'm off. Have the rest if you want.

274
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,640
You're no singer, you slut!
-Leave her alone or you'll answer to me.

275
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,680
Oh, don't bother with that lot!

276
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,760
Fuck you!

277
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,280
Go and prostitute yourself on the street!

278
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,320
While you still can!

279
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,000
Thanks very much.

280
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,920
You'll ruin your voice doing that.
-I have to eat.

281
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,760
Of course you do.

282
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,960
I'm Louis Leple.

283
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:55,600
Here's my card. Come round to Gerney<i>'</i>s,
tomorrow at two.

284
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,360
Are you a singer?
-No, but I have other talents.

285
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:03,320
Bring your music with you,
whatever you intend singing.

286
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,840
What if I don't come?

287
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,160
That's up to you, my girl.

288
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,760
This is all you have to show for a whole day?
This is how you reward my belief in you?

289
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,880
I've put a little aside for my father.
He's sick and he's broke.

290
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,480
I'm not a social worker.
-No really. He's sick.

291
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,360
If I toss you out on the street 
maybe you'll get it.

292
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,440
Let her go!

293
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,080
Never! I'd rather starve than be a whore.

294
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,040
If you die, it's your own fault!
-Shut up!

295
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,680
I want MORE, is that clear?

296
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,960
Or you spread your legs, just like the rest.

297
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,600
You first.

298
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,440
Albert, I'm sorry...

299
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,560
Please stay!
-Leave the bastard.

300
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,960
Give her something to drink.

301
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,720
Are you coming to the Chinese?
-Who else is going?

302
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,080
The two Italians.

303
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:41,400
Plenty of snuff and tobacco.
And the warmth of another body...

304
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:47,480
Because we did it once,
doesn't mean I wish to do it again.

305
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,560
Don't start.
-Shall I explain?

306
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,920
I care not a jot for you,
and you want to know why?

307
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:59,160
No, I'm too stupid?
Because I'm an artist.

308
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:03,240
I'm going to the top. I know it.
I've always known it!

309
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,360
It's the Little Flower...

310
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,480
...Saint Theresa,
I foresee great things.

311
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,120
Seen her clothes?
She looks ill.

312
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,360
Where did he find her?

313
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,120
She's unbelievable.

314
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,560
Champagne.

315
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,280
The boss is crazy about her.
-What a voice!

316
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:58,640
She's really something, Louis.
-Spare me your jealousy, Josette.

317
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,680
What's your name again?
-Edith Giovanna Gassion.

318
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,800
Hmm, not very impressive.
-I have other names:

319
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,440
Huguette Helias, Tania...

320
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,120
...Denise Jay.

321
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:44,400
You've had a manicure!
-That wasn't the question.

322
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,760
You're just like a bird.
-You think so?

323
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,160
Really?

324
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,800
Is <i>'</i>Little Bird<i>'</i> taken?
-Yes, it's taken.

325
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,080
A sparrow...

326
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,960
Would you call a sparrow <i>'</i>piaf<i>'</i>?
Is that how you say it?

327
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,320
<i>The Little Sparrow</i>.
-Brilliant!

328
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,480
It's stupid.
-What would YOU know?

329
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,440
<i>The Little Sparrow.</i>
-Brilliant!

330
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:17,400
You'll need a suitable repertoire.
Bruants <i>'</i>Les Mmes de la Cloche<i>'</i>.

331
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:21,680
I know it.
-If necessary practise it all night.

332
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,240
We'll start you on Friday.

333
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,520
Show's beginning.

334
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,840
Take care of your protge.
She's a slow starter.

335
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,520
I'm on my way.

336
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,160
Philippo, no more alcohol backstage.

337
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:49,480
What are you doing?
-I'd no time to finish it.

338
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,120
I'm knitting the sleeve.
-Now! We've a full house.

339
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,200
All the more reason!
She can't go on like that!

340
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,520
Look, our star is dressing the newcomer.

341
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:04,640
That's fine.
-Girls, let's go.

342
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:08,400
I have to throw up.
-Not now. Hurry up.

343
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:18,600
A day or two ago, on my way home,
Lady Luck led me...

344
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,680
...to the artist you'll see tonight.

345
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,240
Here she is, exactly as I first saw her,
an unpolished jewel:

346
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:29,400
From the street to Gerny<i>'</i>s:
<i>The Little Sparrow.</i>

347
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,360
She's like a sister to me.

348
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:19,680
Did I lie?
-She's extraordinary.

349
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:11,320
This is the great Jean Mermoz.

350
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,720
This is for you.

351
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,880
Thank you.

352
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,440
Come along, Edith.

353
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,640
You've won them over.
And you'll continue doing just that...

354
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:25,120
...I'm introducing you to someone 
who can help your career along.

355
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,040
I'm Marguerite Monnot.
I'm a pianist.

356
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,400
If you need music,I'll gladly supply it.

357
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,000
Thank you.
-Come.

358
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:44,160
Edith, this is Mr. Jacques Canetti.
Artistic director of <i>Radio Cit.</i>

359
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:48,560
Miss, I was under your spell.
-Thank you.

360
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:52,680
Please, join us at our table.
-I can't. I have to go.

361
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,920
What can be so important?

362
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:57,920
Thank you.

363
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,040
What's the matter?

364
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,080
Wonderful, wonderful...

365
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:13,000
Get out right now or I'll...
-Hit him in the kisser!

366
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,920
I've waited an hour for you!

367
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,760
Go to hell, you bastard!

368
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,000
Stop it.

369
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:22,120
Miss, you're wonderful.

370
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:22,160
My hand's about to fall off.
More bubbles.

371
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,200
Give me the bottle.

372
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:29,920
I said you should listen to me. Radio is
a powerful medium, am I right, Coquatrix?

373
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:33,600
But don't underestimate the <i>Music Hall</i>.
-Of course not.

374
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,120
I've something for you.

375
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,040
A song?
-Of course.

376
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,200
Raymond!
Mireille, fetch Raymond !

377
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:47,280
Somebody here for you.

378
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,320
That big guy wants to see you.

379
00:49:54,280 --> 00:50:00,160
This is Raymond Asso.
Writer, composer, poet.

380
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,280
I'll be right back.

381
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,800
I love your work.

382
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:07,120
I don't love your face.

383
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,320
I've seen you often.

384
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,040
I haven't seen you.

385
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,960
Midnight, everyone on their feet!

386
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:43,240
You're a big star.
-Yes, I wear high heels.

387
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:52,120
If you wish...
Call me. I'll be waiting.

388
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,560
Papa Leple!

389
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:18,480
A toast to Papa Leple,
my saviour.

390
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:27,280
Grasse. October 1963

391
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:27,720
He was a very discreet man...

392
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:33,560
Were you here yesterday?
-Yes, but I didn't see him.

393
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:37,600
So he was at home.
-Perhaps. Too bad.

394
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:41,520
He was discreet,
so lovely and attentive.

395
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:13,800
You bring bad luck!

396
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,800
It's her fault!

397
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,440
Are you the <i>Little Sparrow?</i>

398
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,880
Come with me, please.
-Why?

399
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:36,480
This way.

400
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,360
Let me through.

401
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,840
I'm talking to you.

402
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,560
Have you ties with the underworld?
-No.

403
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,960
Leave me alone.

404
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:54,560
And Henri Valette? And George, Johnny the
Sailor and Albert? Never heard of them?

405
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,680
Those are friends of mine.They've nothing to do with this

406
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:03,880
Being an accessory is a criminal offence.
-I'm innocent! I've done nothing.

407
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:07,160
I've lost everything.
-Where were you last night?

408
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:10,040
I told you: partying...

409
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:15,480
Bastards, swine!
This is disgusting!

410
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,720
We're not in the theatre now.

411
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:21,800
It seems you have a couple of nasty friends.

412
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,320
They're not like that.
-Sure, and I'm a cretin.

413
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,280
Have you an explanation?
-Not at this time.

414
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,520
It's a disgrace!

415
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:37,760
Go back to the gutter, slag!
-Leave her alone!

416
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:41,440
She didn't do it!
-Have you named names?

417
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,920
This is a funeral.
Have a little respect!

418
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:51,280
Just one more question.
-Vultures! Go away!

419
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,200
Out of the way!
Get the hell out of here!

420
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:59,040
It's over. I'm dead.
I've been dragged through the shit.

421
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,480
Forget it.

422
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,640
I haven't done anything!
-I know that.

423
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,520
Open up!

424
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,480
What?
-Simone Berteaut?

425
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:22,440
Yes.

426
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,920
Miss, please come with us.

427
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,720
Why?

428
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:33,040
Your mother has arranged with the court
for you to be placed in a boarding school.

429
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:38,000
Immediately.
Pack your things.

430
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:42,240
No! She's staying here.
-This has nothing to do with you.

431
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,960
For the last time: go and pack.

432
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:52,440
You want to see me dead!
That's it, isn't it?

433
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:57,840
Let me go!
-She's staying here. Momone!

434
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:00,120
Edith, don't let them!

435
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:05,560
My things! I don't have any things!
Do you hear that, you shit?

436
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:09,720
Momone, no!

437
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,280
Papa Leple...

438
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,160
Oh, Papa Leple...

439
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:37,040
You killed him.
Where's the money?

440
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,240
What can you expect from
a former whore?

441
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:26,920
Everybody out of the dressing room!
Mamy, you stay.

442
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,320
I need a shot for the pain.

443
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,720
Get the American.

444
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,400
You can come in now.

445
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:18,440
A triumph. You were magnificent.
-Doug?

446
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:26,160
I need fresh air. 
I'm going back with you to Chlons.

447
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:31,320
But that's 400 kilometres away.

448
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:36,400
You can go to hell!
I'm sick of you all!

449
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:39,520
You're exhausted.
It's a long journey.

450
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:43,000
No, no, always no!
Drop dead!

451
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,720
Let's go back.

452
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,360
Turn around!

453
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,320
You've ruined it for me!
-What's this...

454
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,120
<i>The blood test is a catastrophe.</i>

455
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:28,240
She has two broken ribs we're unable to set.
This is going to take weeks.

456
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:32,520
<i>I'd cancel all engagements.</i>

457
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,040
It's tight enough. Please leave.

458
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:46,600
Doctor, give me an injection so I can sing.

459
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:49,800
My admiration knows no bounds.

460
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:53,120
That may be, but I have none.

461
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:56,000
Cancel the concert.
You're risking your life.

462
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:59,400
What's life without risk?

463
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:02,680
What would you say to a new life?
Change your surroundings.

464
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:05,200
My what?
-Your surroundings.

465
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:08,400
Why didn't you call me sooner?

466
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:12,200
I was busy. I didn't know 
what you wanted of me.

467
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:15,720
I saw you sing.
You have much to learn.

468
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,560
No one's ever said that before.

469
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:23,040
In three months' time you won't be that<i>'girl'</i>any more.
Your bar days are over.

470
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,560
<i>He had clear blue eyes</i>
<i>That flashed like lightning</i>

471
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,240
<i>in a storm in the night</i>

472
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:32,920
In-a-storm-in-the-night!
Articulation!

473
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:34,800
Again!

474
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,240
<i>He had clear blue eyes</i>

475
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,400
Are those words or noises?

476
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:46,120
What do want of me?
-Perfect diction!

477
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:49,480
I sing as I speak.
-Badly.

478
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,880
You shout the words
and they lose their meaning.

479
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,400
More slowly, Marguerite.

480
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,640
We've been at it six hours.
Can someone open a window?

481
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:01,760
We'll be doing breathing shortly.

482
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,720
From the top.

483
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:11,600
<i>He had clear blue eyes, that flashed </i>
<i>like lightning. In a storm...</i>

484
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:14,480
You're not paying attention!
You're not creating.

485
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:19,040
You must <i>become</i> the woman in love.

486
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,680
Think as an actress.

487
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,520
He's making fun of me.

488
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,360
We're all tired. We'll take a break.

489
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,960
He makes me feel as if I can't sing.

490
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,160
Who do you think you are?

491
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,440
Don't be satisfied with half measures.

492
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,360
I've been singing since I was nine years old.

493
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:46,280
Take it easy.
This is new and difficult.

494
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:51,080
You're interpreting something, understand?
You must LIVE the song!

495
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,520
No one's ever had a problem
with my diction before.

496
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:57,440
No one... like whom?

497
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:00,760
The riff-raff in Gerny<i>'</i>s?
Or on the street?

498
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:12,120
Do what I say or go back to the gutter.

499
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:19,840
Edith!

500
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:30,080
Here's to my girl who never forgets her vader.

501
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:32,040
To my little one!

502
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:35,040
Your mentor, is he rich?

503
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,640
Not a cent... He does it 
for the love of art.

504
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:40,480
For the love of your arse you mean!

505
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:44,880
Come on, little one, sing.
-Sing for us!

506
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:37,080
That's the way to treat her.

507
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,560
I let her have her own way.

508
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,320
I was too good to her!

509
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:11,000
You're too stiff.

510
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:15,240
Like a bare-knuckle fighter.
Performing is an art.

511
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:18,560
You have to grab the audience.

512
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:22,400
You have lovely hands.
Use them.

513
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,040
Sing with them.

514
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:25,720
Again, Marguerite.

515
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:31,720
Move them.

516
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,000
The hands!

517
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,040
That's it.

518
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:44,200
I look stupid.
-Continue.

519
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:55,640
Put this on.

520
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:00,040
That's not what people want.
It's my voice they wish to hear.

521
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:03,800
How can you be so talented 
and at the same time so dense?

522
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,680
Open the door.
-I have to throw up!

523
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:34,920
Is she drunk?
-She's in panic.

524
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,800
The audience is waiting.

525
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,000
For weeks you've been pestering me for this gig.

526
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:47,600
For God's sake take the stage 
before the tear the place apart.

527
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,240
She's on her way.

528
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,400
Edith?
Three minutes.

529
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:59,200
This isn't a bar, it's a theatre.
What am I doing here?

530
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:03,440
Stage fright.
It's a good sign.

531
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:09,920
Edith?

532
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,160
What?

533
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:17,480
This is it.
This is what we worked hard for.

534
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,640
You can't back down now.

535
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:23,520
Open the door.

536
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,920
No, I can't do it.

537
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,880
Please, open the door.

538
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:35,920
On your feet.

539
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:21,680
Ladies and gentlemen, Edith Piaf!

540
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:32,840
<i>...Edith Piaf Triumphs</i>...
<i>...Fame for Street Singer...</i>

541
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,440
<i>...The Little Sparrow Premieres...</i>

542
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:39,960
<i>...The first man</i>
<i>Who Helped Me...</i>

543
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:43,800
<i>...Piaf On Tour...</i>

544
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:51,440
<i>...Edith Piaf's Appearance</i>
<i>in the A.B.C. Theatre...</i>

545
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:10,160
<i>The Little Sparrow is Dead</i>
<i>Long Live Edith Piaf!</i>

546
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:29,120
<i>"I was hurrying home,</i>
<i>needing your love to lean on,</i>

547
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:35,160
<i>...only to find an empty room.</i>
<i>Waiting and waiting; I know that room."</i>

548
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:39,520
I can't wait to see you in this piece.
Look out, here comes Canetti.

549
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:43,760
The conductor's been waiting three hours.
-So?

550
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:46,320
The premiere is less than 48 hours away.

551
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:49,880
Do you know many people whom
Cocteau's written a piece for?

552
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:52,440
Miss?
-Yes, Suzanne?

553
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:56,440
Meurisse called.
Dinner with Mr. Cocteau at eight.

554
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,040
You see?

555
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:01,640
Ask him to come back at midnight.
-Are you sure?

556
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:05,400
You're worse than Raymond.
Do this, do that.

557
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:08,680
That's why you fired him.
-Stop it.

558
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:12,120
Do you wish to see the gowns?
-Yes, the gowns.

559
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:24,040
That's all of them.
Careful with those pins.

560
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,760
The simplest one, without the collar.

561
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:33,120
There's a man at the door...
He has something for you.

562
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:35,080
Who is it?
-A soldier.

563
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:39,680
I told him you were busy. 
He's outside in the corridor.A bit embarrassed.

564
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:42,000
Have him come in.

565
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,280
Will you come this way?

566
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,960
Here she is.
-Much better without the collar.

567
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,240
Yes?

568
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:07,480
My name is Michel Emer.
I'm a corporal.

569
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:10,440
This isn't the army.
What do you want?

570
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,360
I have a song for you.

571
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:20,200
Not another... I've enough already.
I have a premiere in two days' time.

572
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:21,760
I wish this one.

573
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:24,160
Tomorrow I leave for the front.

574
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:30,440
There's the piano.
You have five minutes.

575
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:36,320
Edith...

576
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,920
We shall have to wait.

577
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:18,520
Stop.

578
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,960
I want it.

579
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,800
Everybody out.

580
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:28,280
You can't mean that.
We're already late.

581
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:30,080
What can't she mean?

582
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:32,800
Play it.
I want it for Bobino.

583
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:37,960
You can't do that.

584
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:42,000
Edith Piaf can do whatever she pleases!

585
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:51,840
French, please.

586
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:55,760
She's too hopeless, too poor...
-Help us out here, Charles.

587
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,840
I'm no translator.

588
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:03,800
<i>'</i>Miserable. And not in the French
tradition of the <i>Can-Can</i> and <i>Gay Paris.'</i>

589
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:05,360
A complete flop.

590
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:08,960
This isn't the first time I've had to fight.

591
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:11,880
The Americans want pretty girls, not me.

592
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:15,560
I'm not the Parisian sex bomb 
you were hoping for.

593
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:20,440
Can you picture me in a ballet?
With a feather in my arse?

594
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:30,080
Go ahead and laugh.
I'm not what they want.

595
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:33,560
They think I'm too doleful, THEY are stupid.
-Yes, too stupid.

596
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:37,240
.

597
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,040
.

598
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:44,960
You made the front page.
-Two columns.

599
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:46,400
.

600
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:50,720
.

601
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:53,680
.

602
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:02,960
I can't read it.
Translate it.

603
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:08,360
He says that she shouldn't let you go. 
That it would be a mistake.

604
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:11,080
The Americans don't deserve you.

605
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:15,160
I knew something would happen!
I have to change...

606
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:17,760
...Ginou, help me help me choose a dress.

607
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:22,400
I'm going out tonight. I have a date.

608
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:32,640
.

609
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:39,240
What's this, Marcel?
-Beef...try it.

610
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:44,040
It smells like damp dog.

611
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:47,680
.

612
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:48,640
What?

613
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:51,920
.

614
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:53,480
.

615
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,680
Your English is as good as the meat.

616
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,200
Don't you like it here?

617
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,600
I was taken a bit by surprise.
I didn't expect it...

618
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:17,760
...when you phoned to say that as two French people
in New York we should have a meal...

619
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:22,240
...I didn't expect this.
-I come here all the time.

620
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:29,280
You sure know how to spoil a girl.

621
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:45,400
Have you decided?
-Twee broodjes pastrami.

622
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:53,480
I'll handle this: two Tournedos Rossini,
and a bottle of Chateau Langelus 1938.

623
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:02,080
Are you hungry?
-It's better than cooked dog.

624
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,520
I'm sorry.

625
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,840
Let's start over. Okay?

626
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:13,680
How long have you been in New York?
-Eight weeks.

627
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:18,440
And do you like America?
-It doesn't interest me at all.

628
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:20,800
I don't understand them,
and they don't understand me.

629
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,440
You must miss Paris.
-Terribly.

630
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:26,120
What do you do when you're not singing?

631
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:32,040
Your like the police with your questions. 
I knit.

632
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:36,280
Give me your size and 
I'll knit you a sweater.

633
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,920
No, but thanks all the same...

634
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:43,040
Those people recognized you.
-Really?

635
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:50,480
They said: <i>'</i>That schmuck lost his
recent fights. He's washed up.<i>'</i>

636
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:53,240
I'll show them who's washed up.
-No!

637
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:56,840
Relax. I was joking.

638
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,080
It's fine.

639
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:23,280
Can we be less formal to each other?
-Of course.

640
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:27,960
What do you do when you aren't boxing?
-I train and I run...

641
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:32,640
And after the training?
-ln Morocco I work on my farm.

642
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:35,080
You have a farm?

643
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:37,440
I breed pigs.

644
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,800
Well, why not?

645
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:48,880
Absolutely. Why not?

646
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:52,160
It's a fine farm: modern, with superb, fat pigs.

647
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:55,360
Who takes care of them when you're boxing?
-My wife.

648
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:04,920
You have...

649
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:07,480
...wonderful hands.

650
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:13,720
Did you hear what I said, Momone?
-You have really beautiful fingers.

651
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:16,960
Listen.

652
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:19,120
What colour are your eyes?

653
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:23,680
He leaned over...
-And his breath smelled.

654
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:27,040
You can be such a bitch!
-He is of course a pig breeder.

655
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:29,920
He said...
-Violet blue.

656
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:31,920
Of course, violet blue.

657
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:36,280
It was the way he said it.
As though he was a child.

658
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:41,440
Then he said:
-You're just like a fairy.

659
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:44,760
A bit of an exaggeration.

660
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:16,160
Did you kiss him?
-I didn't dare.

661
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:20,440
It was a wonderful evening.
-Too short.

662
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:26,800
Will you come and see me box?
-Of course.

663
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:31,320
Did he try to kiss you?

664
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:33,960
I don't know if he even thought about it.

665
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:36,200
And I'm supposed to believe that!

666
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,480
I'll come to see you sing.

667
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:44,040
Goodnight.

668
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:50,480
He's the love of my life...

669
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:21,800
You were superb.

670
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,840
Mr. Lucien Roupp,
Mr. Cerdan's manager.

671
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:29,680
Mr. Jameson,
of CBS television.

672
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:32,760
.

673
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:45,600
Marlene.

674
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:52,800
Good evening. I'm sorry, 
I just wanted to say something.

675
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:57,960
I haven't been in Paris in years.

676
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:03,400
But this evening,when you sang
 I was right back there again..

677
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:06,360
...on her streets, beneath her skies.

678
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:10,000
Your voice is the soul of Paris.

679
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:14,520
You took me with you on your travels.
You brought tears to my eyes.

680
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:20,040
Thank you, from the bottom of my heart.
-Thank you.

681
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:58,440
Come on.

682
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:09,360
I'm beginning to like this city.
The stars are out tonight.

683
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:11,680
Let's go.

684
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:30,160
Marc, do you know how long
a frog lives for?

685
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:33,200
In fairytales or in real life?

686
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:39,240
No one ever read me fairytales.

687
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:42,240
You never had the chance to hear them.

688
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:46,480
That's true, but all the same...

689
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:36,400
Dreux. 13 December 1959

690
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:17,320
I'm a little tired.

691
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:20,440
I'll be right back.

692
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,520
Lay her down there.

693
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:51,720
I'll go back on in a minute.
-Out of the question.

694
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:53,800
Nobody tells ME when to stop.

695
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:57,960
What are we going to do?
-Sorry, you'll have to clear the house.

696
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:00,760
I'm going back there!
-No, Edith.

697
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:03,440
I have to continue.
-It would be suicide.

698
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:04,920
You're going to hospital.

699
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:09,680
No, I'm begging you!

700
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:14,520
She left hospital only three weeks ago.
There'll be more galas.

701
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:18,320
Take me back to the stage.

702
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:21,280
I have to sing.

703
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:24,400
I have to sing, Louis.
I have no choice.

704
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:27,920
Edith, please...

705
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:31,200
Can't you hear them?
-Stop...

706
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:33,720
Shut that door!

707
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:35,800
Take me back there, Louis.

708
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:39,920
If I don't sing tonight...

709
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:47,200
If I don't sing one song at least,
I'll lose faith in myself. Do you follow?

710
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:03,000
Doctor...

711
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:06,440
...do what you have to do.

712
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:34,680
Not this time, boys.

713
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:38,320
You think I'm going to collapse,
but I'm in great shape.

714
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:41,280
Don't you dare write that this is my suicide tour!

715
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:47,800
<i>'Padam'!</i>

716
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:17,960
<i>Saint Theresa,</i>
<i>first of all my thanks...</i>

717
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:23,520
<i>I know you're behind it all.</i>
<i>You sent him to me.</i>

718
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:28,160
<i>I've found love,</i>
<i>thanks to you.</i>

719
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:32,440
<i>Baby Jesus,</i>
<i>protect Marcel.</i>

720
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:46,800
Come on, Marcel!

721
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:50,120
No!

722
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:53,640
It's too early, Edith.
-He's going to win. I feel it.

723
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:56,320
If things go wrong, you've a problem.
-What do you mean?

724
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:01,640
If there's no problem,
I'll call you. Now go.

725
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:14,880
Hurry up!

726
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:31,840
Come on, Marcel!

727
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:49,880
One more round!

728
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:05,760
Come on, Marcel!

729
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:11,800
Finish him off!

730
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:51,200
What's happening?
-Zale is sitting it out.

731
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:20,880
Did he do it?
Is he the world champion?

732
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:22,440
You look like an angel.

733
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:26,360
Not a fairy any more?

734
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:34,760
You're my champion.

735
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:37,360
I want to be with you always.

736
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:41,240
There was nothing before I met you.
All that is in the past.

737
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:47,280
Stay with me.

738
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:55,640
<i>My dearest, before going to bed last night</i>
<i>I crossed off a day...</i>

739
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:58,880
<i>...a day that was long and short.</i>

740
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:04,760
<i>Such pain, that plane flew away with my heart.
My life, my breath...</i>

741
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:08,120
<i>...my sweet boy,</i>
<i>my child, my dearest love...</i>

742
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:12,960
<i>...your scent is still on my sheets,</i>
<i>and my heart sleeps without waking...</i>

743
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:15,320
<i>...in the arms of sadness.

744
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:19,920
<i>Darling, I love you.</i>
<i>What have you done to me?</i>

745
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:21,160
<i>I miss you.</i>

746
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:25,640
<i>I'm depressed, lifeless,</i>
<i>as though I'm waiting for something...</i>

747
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:33,320
<i>...hold me close against your heart and
know that nothing means more to me than you.</i>

748
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:38,280
<i>Bring me back my heart.</i>

749
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:42,040
<i>Whenever I'm in a restaurant and
hear 'La Vie en Rose'...</i>

750
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:48,640
<i>If I see, my love, how devoted you are
to your wife and children...</i>

751
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:50,720
<i>...I have the urge to go far away...</i>

752
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:55,240
<i>...and perhaps one day you'll be
grateful for what I've done.</i>

753
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:59,680
<i>I can't have you to myself 
and I can't live without you.</i>

754
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:03,480
<i>As God is my witness,I ask nothing for myself...</i>

755
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:06,200
<i>...and am prepared to sacrifice everything.</i>

756
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:11,000
<i>'If life were to take you from me...</i>

757
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:15,520
<i>...if you should die or be far away,</i>
<i>and you were to love me, I too would die.'</i>

758
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:24,000
In three months' time,
wait for it, in April...

759
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:28,800
...I'm going to star in <i>L'Olympia.</i>
Full house and then we're back again.

760
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:32,800
Your liver is damaged...

761
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,000
...you've been ill and need rest.
It's serious this time.

762
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:38,720
I'm only 44.
I'm not dead yet.

763
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:41,920
Because of all the cancellations
we're broke.

764
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:44,200
Oh, so it's my fault?

765
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:47,760
I didn't say that. 
The taxman is breathing down our necks.

766
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:50,960
We have to pay 120.000 <i>franc</i>.

767
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:56,400
I only have jaundice! That won't last
100 years. Don't exaggerate.

768
01:37:57,120 --> 01:37:59,880
I want to sing in <i>L'Olympia</i>.

769
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:10,560
Anything else?
-We shouldn't give in all the time.

770
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:15,360
I can't watch her all the time. 
She discharged herself too soon from hospital.

771
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:19,440
<i>L'Olympia</i> is in 3 months.
That's going to be a disaster.

772
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:23,320
She needs this sort of challenge.
-This is hopeless.

773
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:27,160
In that case I'll have to tell the insurers
that we're cancelling everything.

774
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:31,080
We have to make the decisions for her.
Whether she likes it or not.

775
01:39:23,120 --> 01:39:26,440
I said to myself,
<i>'</i>Edith, it's over.<i>'</i>

776
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:29,840
There's someone else. You've lost him.
-Did he have an affair?

777
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:32,920
I he did have, would I be telling you?

778
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:35,720
He left the restaurant.
I followed him.

779
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:41,000
My Marcel walked the whole of New York
to eat with an old blind boxer...

780
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:45,600
...whom he'd met a couple of years before.
Can you imagine that?

781
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:52,120
Men like that are scarce.
-My Marcel...

782
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:55,760
...that's all you ever talk about.
That's the only thing that counts.

783
01:39:59,320 --> 01:40:03,600
But listen, Ginou,
I'll never have him.

784
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:08,080
He'll never be mine.
He'll remain with his wife and children.

785
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:15,760
He phones her every day.

786
01:40:17,120 --> 01:40:21,080
I pretend I don't know what's going on.
I want him to be happy.

787
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:24,720
I'll be right back.

788
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:31,880
<i>I</i> could have been Edith Piaf.

789
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:34,960
There's more in life than chansons.

790
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:49,880
It's been too long, Marcel!
Call <i>Orly.</i> Book a flight this evening.

791
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:54,920
SUCH a long ocean sailing: 
I'd never survive it.I miss you, Marcel.

792
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:57,880
I can't bear to be apart from you.

793
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:02,400
Perhaps I have to return to Paris.
-Hold on.

794
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:06,360
I'm no more than Madame's lapdog.
-Stop it...

795
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:13,440
Rum, coke! Whisky!
People think I'm rubbish.

796
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:16,440
Getting drunk in Belleville was better.

797
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:21,360
You abandoned me.

798
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:23,440
That's enough, Momone!

799
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:27,440
Take her away from here.

800
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:33,880
I'm taking the boat.

801
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:36,720
To your career, Edith!

802
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,120
Marcel, leave tonight. For me.

803
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:39,800
You won't be sleeping if I'm not there.
-Thank God for that, Marcel.

804
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:53,000
I'll make you coffee.
You stay where you are.

805
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:01,280
Let me serve you.

806
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:19,760
What are you doing here?

807
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:38,880
I knew you'd come.

808
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:44,120
Lucien found it hard to get tickets.

809
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:51,040
I've a gift for you.

810
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:58,160
You don't look too well.
You could do with some sun. You're pale.

811
01:44:07,120 --> 01:44:08,360
Ginou!

812
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:11,920
I'm looking for that watch!

813
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:21,480
Wat nou?
I'm looking for that watch!

814
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:25,720
In the red Cartier box.
Shit, it was right here!

815
01:44:34,720 --> 01:44:35,920
What's the matter with you?

816
01:44:36,120 --> 01:44:39,920
I'm looking for Marcel's watch!
Where is that watch?

817
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:48,720
I'm looking for Marcel's watch!
What?

818
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:53,760
Louis? What's the matter?

819
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,120
I want you to be brave, Edith.

820
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:01,520
Is it Marcel?

821
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:04,320
What?

822
01:45:07,080 --> 01:45:09,000
The plane crashed...

823
01:45:27,160 --> 01:45:28,400
Marcel!

824
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:32,960
Marcel!

825
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:07,240
What more can I tell you?

826
01:47:08,280 --> 01:47:10,000
They say you're the best clairvoyant there is.

827
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:15,000
This is your third visit this week.
I've told you all I know.

828
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:17,120
Why do you keep coming back?

829
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:21,320
So you can tell me again.

830
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:25,720
So that I know why I should continue living.

831
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:30,200
He died in the air, so that is where he must be...

832
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:44,400
<i>California, August 1955</i>

833
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:57,480
Jack Peals! Can we go any faster?
I need air.

834
01:47:57,680 --> 01:48:00,160
I love the heat.
It makes me dizzy.

835
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:03,560
Step on it.
Our pin-up is melting!

836
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:10,200
I'm getting a sore throat. 
Then you can take care of me.Like a good husband.

837
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:14,000
The best I've had.
-The FIRST you've had!

838
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:18,040
Are you going to spend the day gawping at up?

839
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:23,040
I'm feeling nauseous.

840
01:48:23,480 --> 01:48:26,360
Look out, you'll drive us off the road.

841
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:32,600
Let me drive. Stop, I'll drive.
Then Ginou can throw up.

842
01:48:37,880 --> 01:48:38,800
Go on, Ginou.

843
01:48:40,240 --> 01:48:41,760
May I, Madame?

844
01:48:43,880 --> 01:48:45,400
Go ahead, Ginou!

845
01:48:46,040 --> 01:48:48,200
Very good!

846
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,080
Bye bye, Ginou!

847
01:48:55,960 --> 01:48:57,640
Wait for me!

848
01:49:01,480 --> 01:49:02,960
My, you're some driver.

849
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:10,840
Our journey hasn't been wasted after all.
We just murdered a tree.

850
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:23,360
My God, the service here is awful.
Can nobody take our order?

851
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:29,280
Take it easy. You're no star here.
<i>Mocambo</i> is tonight.

852
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:33,240
Remind me who invited us.

853
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:37,200
Marlon Brando, Ginger Rogers,
Mr. Chaplin...

854
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:42,520
What's this?

855
01:49:44,160 --> 01:49:48,080
We didn't order that swill!
-That's your cocktail.

856
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:00,240
Don't touch me!
I said don't touch me!

857
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:02,560
Here, wipe it off.

858
01:50:05,080 --> 01:50:07,080
We should get a divorce.

859
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:15,120
How many times a day are you shooting up now?

860
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:17,640
About ten.

861
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:24,360
Excuse me for being so direct, 
but why do you do it?

862
01:50:27,480 --> 01:50:29,600
So that my body doesn't protest.

863
01:50:33,240 --> 01:50:37,160
When did you start injecting every day?

864
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:40,560
Five years ago, after the plane crash.

865
01:50:40,760 --> 01:50:45,200
I contracted rheumatism.
I couldn't knit any more.

866
01:50:47,120 --> 01:50:49,920
You're very dependent on it.

867
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:53,680
It's an addiction...
-Doctor?

868
01:50:54,160 --> 01:50:56,720
I want my wife to kick the habit.

869
01:50:59,560 --> 01:51:02,760
I want to be well again. I can do it.

870
01:51:07,480 --> 01:51:11,840
October 1960 - 5 years later

871
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,080
Danielle, a chair!

872
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:44,640
Edith?

873
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:53,080
Here you are.

874
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:55,360
Sit down now.

875
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:06,880
Bruno...

876
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:14,720
...there won't be another 
<i>L'Olympia</i>.

877
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:22,680
I understand.

878
01:52:34,160 --> 01:52:35,400
No!

879
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:48,440
The composer Charles Dumont and
the lyricist Michel Vaucaire are here.

880
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:51,760
They wish us to hear their <i>chanson</i>.

881
01:52:59,560 --> 01:53:01,800
Quickly then. I'm tired.

882
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:23,320
<i>no, no nothing at all</i>

883
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:28,200
<i>no, I regret nothing at all</i>

884
01:53:29,240 --> 01:53:33,640
<i>not the good times I had</i>

885
01:53:34,160 --> 01:53:37,920
<i>not the pain</i>
<i>it means nothing to me</i>

886
01:53:38,120 --> 01:53:39,440
Stop!

887
01:53:40,640 --> 01:53:44,040
I love it. Carry on!

888
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:47,480
<i>with my souvenirs</i>

889
01:53:48,040 --> 01:53:50,560
<i>I build a fire</i>

890
01:53:50,760 --> 01:53:52,760
<i>my sadness, my pleasure</i>

891
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:55,280
<i>I don't need it any longer</i>

892
01:53:55,600 --> 01:53:57,960
<i>the loves are gone</i>

893
01:53:58,160 --> 01:54:00,440
<i>the traumas as well</i>

894
01:54:00,640 --> 01:54:03,200
<i>erased for ever</i>

895
01:54:03,400 --> 01:54:04,720
<i>I must start anew</i>

896
01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:06,560
You're wonderful!

897
01:54:06,920 --> 01:54:10,880
That's precisely what I was looking out for.
Unbelievable. This is so ME!

898
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:13,840
That is MY life.
That is me!

899
01:54:14,160 --> 01:54:19,200
Call Coquatrix. <i>L'Olympia</i> is on!
Play it again. It's exquisite.

900
01:54:19,720 --> 01:54:23,360
<i>no, no nothing at all</i>

901
01:54:24,680 --> 01:54:28,120
<i>no, I regret nothing at all</i>

902
01:54:48,040 --> 01:54:50,920
<i>You're doing well, my dear.</i>
Your friend, Marguerite<i>'</i>

903
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:55,680
Everyone's here: Aznavour,
Mr. Cocteau, Yves Montand.

904
01:54:55,880 --> 01:54:58,880
Montand's here?
I read that he wasn't coming.

905
01:54:59,080 --> 01:55:00,240
He's come for you!

906
01:55:00,440 --> 01:55:04,480
They've been waiting a half hour.
-The room is jumping.

907
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:17,680
Not too tight?

908
01:55:20,280 --> 01:55:23,040
Who's that?
-A friend.

909
01:55:43,680 --> 01:55:45,760
Let's go, Edith.

910
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:47,240
Up you get.

911
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:54,120
My crucifix?

912
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:56,880
My crucifix...

913
01:55:59,480 --> 01:56:00,560
My crucifix?

914
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:03,760
I forgot. I'll fetch it.
-I won't sing without it.

915
01:56:04,840 --> 01:56:07,400
Everybody out!

916
01:57:15,400 --> 01:57:19,600
<i>Grasse, Oktober 1963</i>
<i>The Final Night</i>

917
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:21,240
See you tomorrow.

918
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:23,000
I'll do it.

919
01:57:28,280 --> 01:57:33,680
I'm afraid, Simone. I'm losing my memory.
It's serious this time.

920
01:57:35,080 --> 01:57:37,480
My brain is confused.

921
01:57:37,880 --> 01:57:43,240
I try to remember things but they won't come.

922
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:48,920
Things do come, but not the things I want.

923
01:57:51,680 --> 01:57:55,800
I wanted to see his watch.
Don't you remember? Marcel's watch?

924
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:00,880
I'm afraid not. I never knew him.
-I wanted to see his watch...

925
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:20,480
What a face!

926
01:58:22,160 --> 01:58:23,960
You have wild eyes.

927
01:58:27,200 --> 01:58:29,000
I like the little one.

928
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:05,320
Simone?
-Yes, Edith?

929
01:59:07,640 --> 01:59:09,800
I haven't said my prayers.

930
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:15,560
I must get down on my knees and pray.

931
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:20,200
No one will think less of you 
if you don't get down on your knees.

932
01:59:20,520 --> 01:59:23,240
I wish to pray for my papa.

933
02:00:23,800 --> 02:00:25,120
Marcelle...

934
02:00:26,680 --> 02:00:27,880
Marcelle...

935
02:00:28,800 --> 02:00:30,800
...my little ghost...

936
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:37,400
Only Momone knows.
I must tell you about my ghost.

937
02:00:37,600 --> 02:00:40,360
Take it easy, Edith.
-Marcelle!

938
02:00:49,120 --> 02:00:52,400
Marcelle, go to bed. Enough for today.

939
02:00:52,600 --> 02:00:58,400
And I'm supposed to look out for the police
- and your child! What Louis up to?

940
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:01,240
It's your father.

941
02:01:05,960 --> 02:01:07,160
Has she eaten?

942
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:11,120
They're saying you were on the street with her.
-Who says that?

943
02:01:11,320 --> 02:01:14,440
You only have her twice a month
and you can't even do THAT right!

944
02:01:14,680 --> 02:01:16,200
I told you: not on the street!

945
02:01:25,600 --> 02:01:26,440
Come quick.

946
02:01:29,320 --> 02:01:30,040
It's Marcelle!
Come quick!

947
02:01:34,640 --> 02:01:36,160
She's in the hospital!

948
02:01:57,920 --> 02:01:59,800
Are you her mother?

949
02:02:00,360 --> 02:02:05,120
Meningitis. We could do nothing. I'm sorry.

950
02:02:38,280 --> 02:02:39,720
Edith?

951
02:02:41,160 --> 02:02:42,960
I have the crucifix.

952
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:03,360
They told me you were on the beach.

953
02:03:04,240 --> 02:03:08,280
Thanks for agreeing to this interview.
-My pleasure.

954
02:03:09,360 --> 02:03:11,800
How strange to meet you so far from Paris.

955
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,400
I'm never far from Paris.

956
02:03:15,280 --> 02:03:20,320
I have a list of question.
Just say the first thing that occurs to you.

957
02:03:26,400 --> 02:03:29,840
What is your favourite colour?
-Blue.

958
02:03:30,040 --> 02:03:33,880
Your favourite food?
-Roast beef.

959
02:03:35,480 --> 02:03:40,520
Would you like to live sensibly?
-I already do.

960
02:03:44,600 --> 02:03:49,360
<i>Who are your most loyal friends?</i>
-<i>All my genuine friends.</i>

961
02:03:51,560 --> 02:03:54,200
<i>If you were unable to sing...</i>

962
02:03:54,880 --> 02:03:58,160
<i>Then I could no longer live.</i>

963
02:03:59,160 --> 02:04:01,040
<i>Are you afraid of death?</i>

964
02:04:02,480 --> 02:04:04,880
<i>I'm more afraid of loneliness.</i>

965
02:04:06,360 --> 02:04:11,080
<i>Do you pray?</i>
-<i>Yes, for I believe in love.</i>

966
02:04:12,240 --> 02:04:14,200
I don't want to, Simone.

967
02:04:15,160 --> 02:04:18,840
Where's Theo? I want my husband.

968
02:04:19,120 --> 02:04:21,520
Theo will be here in less than an hour.

969
02:04:22,560 --> 02:04:25,320
<i>What was the finest part of the show for you?</i>

970
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:28,360
<i>When the curtain went up.</i>

971
02:04:43,360 --> 02:04:45,600
<i>And as a woman?</i>

972
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:48,800
<i>My first kiss.</i>

973
02:04:50,800 --> 02:04:55,320
<i>Do you like the night?</i>
-<i>Yes, with lots of light.</i>

974
02:04:55,520 --> 02:05:00,040
<i>The morning?</i>
-<i>With a piano and friends.</i>

975
02:05:00,240 --> 02:05:01,440
<i>The evening?</i>

976
02:05:01,680 --> 02:05:04,360
<i>Because that's our morning.</i>

977
02:05:09,680 --> 02:05:11,760
You see, you're breathing.

978
02:05:19,440 --> 02:05:21,360
I can't go back.

979
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:26,880
I can't.

980
02:06:04,360 --> 02:06:07,920
<i>What advice would you give a woman?</i>

981
02:06:09,280 --> 02:06:10,600
<i>Love.</i>

982
02:06:10,840 --> 02:06:13,640
<i>To a young girl?</i>
-<i>Love.</i>

983
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:17,160
<i>To a child?</i>
-<i>Love.</i>

984
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:22,280
Whom are you knitting for?

985
02:06:23,880 --> 02:06:26,640
For anyone who'll wear my sweaters.

986
02:06:28,280 --> 02:06:31,960
That's it. I hope it wasn't too long.

987
02:06:34,160 --> 02:06:37,560
Thank you so much, madame.
-Thank you too.

02:07:20,560 --> 02:07:25,200
<i>no, no nothing at all</i>
