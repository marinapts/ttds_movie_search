1
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,354
The heart...

2
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,763
...for Smoke Frog.

3
00:03:45,832 --> 00:03:47,094
Thank you.

4
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:55,298
This liver for Curl Nose.

5
00:03:55,642 --> 00:03:57,371
Thank you.

6
00:04:02,181 --> 00:04:03,443
Cocoa Leaf...

7
00:04:03,616 --> 00:04:04,776
...the ears.

8
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:06,214
Thank you.

9
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,646
And for you Blunted...

10
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:15,051
...the balls.

11
00:04:18,364 --> 00:04:19,490
Not this again.

12
00:04:19,932 --> 00:04:20,921
I'm helping you.

13
00:04:21,134 --> 00:04:22,260
Then you eat them!

14
00:04:22,435 --> 00:04:24,767
I don't need them.
Neither do the rest of the fellows.

15
00:04:24,871 --> 00:04:25,895
Do you fellows?

16
00:04:25,972 --> 00:04:26,734
No.

17
00:04:26,806 --> 00:04:27,773
Of course not!

18
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,102
Sometimes!

19
00:04:29,342 --> 00:04:30,138
What do you think?

20
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,306
No!

21
00:04:31,377 --> 00:04:32,275
No, no!

22
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,642
But how many times does it take?

23
00:04:34,881 --> 00:04:37,509
I have eight older sisters
and one brother.

24
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:41,251
Father took tapir balls all ten times.

25
00:05:21,828 --> 00:05:23,193
Shall I tell him?

26
00:05:25,231 --> 00:05:27,529
I'm sorry. The balls are useless.

27
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:30,963
You've never had them?

28
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,738
Couldn't tell you what they taste like.

29
00:05:34,741 --> 00:05:35,833
None of you?

30
00:05:37,844 --> 00:05:40,506
No, but it's been fun watching you...

31
00:05:46,352 --> 00:05:47,376
This was your idea!

32
00:05:50,356 --> 00:05:51,653
Get him off me!

33
00:05:58,531 --> 00:06:00,158
Calm down!

34
00:06:17,617 --> 00:06:20,586
Why do you let them treat you like this?

35
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,610
Be strong.

36
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:24,688
Where is your pride?

37
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:32,789
It all works... Yes?

38
00:06:36,235 --> 00:06:37,429
Yes...

39
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,734
...I just can't make children.

40
00:06:46,179 --> 00:06:48,739
There is something I will tell you...

41
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:52,714
...but I warn you, it's very powerful.

42
00:06:54,353 --> 00:06:55,149
What do you speak of?

43
00:06:55,955 --> 00:06:57,547
The soanzo leaf.

44
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,323
The soanzo leaf?

45
00:07:00,593 --> 00:07:03,255
From the great marshes in the south...

46
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,126
This is what gave me my ten children.

47
00:07:17,477 --> 00:07:19,672
No! No! Wait...

48
00:07:21,013 --> 00:07:23,345
You have to rub them on... down there.

49
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,314
Just before you next try.

50
00:07:26,552 --> 00:07:28,611
Apply it generously...

51
00:07:33,226 --> 00:07:35,285
I don't know how to thank you.

52
00:07:37,296 --> 00:07:40,459
If this works...
maybe she'll stop bothering me.

53
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,992
Your wife?

54
00:07:42,468 --> 00:07:44,299
No, her mother.

55
00:07:44,637 --> 00:07:47,037
The old hag wants grandchildren.

56
00:07:56,582 --> 00:07:58,140
Give me some meat.

57
00:07:58,651 --> 00:08:00,642
Here, work on this...

58
00:08:01,053 --> 00:08:02,884
...pure meat...

59
00:08:04,557 --> 00:08:06,889
...ball breath.

60
00:09:11,324 --> 00:09:12,450
What do you want?

61
00:09:16,896 --> 00:09:18,193
What do you want?

62
00:10:13,686 --> 00:10:18,851
I am Flint Sky. I have hunted
this forest from the day I came of age.

63
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:24,762
My father hunted this forest
with me and before me.

64
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,333
Jaguar Paw, my son.

65
00:10:28,634 --> 00:10:30,966
He hunts this forest with me.

66
00:10:32,505 --> 00:10:35,997
He will hunt it with his son
after I am gone.

67
00:10:56,162 --> 00:10:57,527
A good catch?

68
00:10:58,364 --> 00:11:00,332
Good waters here.

69
00:11:03,002 --> 00:11:04,469
The forest gives much here.

70
00:11:10,576 --> 00:11:12,510
We ask only to pass through.

71
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:14,676
Pass.

72
00:11:20,553 --> 00:11:22,384
Keep safe as you pass.

73
00:11:26,025 --> 00:11:27,583
Let's go.

74
00:12:04,396 --> 00:12:06,557
Our lands were ravaged.

75
00:12:07,433 --> 00:12:09,367
We seek a new beginning.

76
00:12:16,342 --> 00:12:17,900
Your lands were ravaged?

77
00:12:21,647 --> 00:12:23,274
Yes...

78
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:27,279
We seek a new beginning...

79
00:12:27,853 --> 00:12:29,115
Be still.

80
00:12:29,355 --> 00:12:30,287
My son!

81
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:33,553
Be still.

82
00:12:38,697 --> 00:12:39,994
Back to the village.

83
00:13:13,732 --> 00:13:18,635
I ask you not to speak
of what you saw in the forest today.

84
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,668
You are troubled.

85
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,639
Yes, I am.

86
00:13:43,162 --> 00:13:47,292
Those people in the forest,
what did you see on them?

87
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:48,993
I do not understand.

88
00:13:50,102 --> 00:13:51,569
Fear.

89
00:13:54,874 --> 00:13:57,843
Deep rotting fear.

90
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:00,970
They were infected by it.

91
00:14:01,847 --> 00:14:03,144
Did you see?

92
00:14:03,682 --> 00:14:05,843
Fear is a sickness.

93
00:14:11,123 --> 00:14:15,253
It will crawl into the soul
of anyone who engages it.

94
00:14:17,062 --> 00:14:21,226
It has tainted your peace already.

95
00:14:23,435 --> 00:14:27,531
I did not raise you
to see you live with fear.

96
00:14:30,075 --> 00:14:31,770
Strike it from your heart.

97
00:14:31,977 --> 00:14:34,673
Do not bring it into our village.

98
00:14:35,214 --> 00:14:38,843
At first light
we will gather with the elders...

99
00:14:39,752 --> 00:14:42,880
...at the sacred hill of our fathers.

100
00:14:43,656 --> 00:14:47,922
There we will call on
their spirits to guide us.

101
00:14:59,104 --> 00:15:00,799
Oh, here he is!

102
00:15:01,774 --> 00:15:03,105
The big lump!

103
00:15:03,943 --> 00:15:05,410
He's useless.

104
00:15:06,111 --> 00:15:07,601
He can't do it.

105
00:15:09,415 --> 00:15:10,905
You! Yes you!

106
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:15,051
With your height and your girth.
You have deceived us.

107
00:15:16,121 --> 00:15:17,383
Get inside!

108
00:15:22,928 --> 00:15:24,452
Damn you! Get in there!

109
00:15:24,797 --> 00:15:26,287
Old woman, please.

110
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:27,666
Move it!

111
00:15:32,037 --> 00:15:33,504
You don't work!

112
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,508
What are you laughing about?

113
00:15:45,484 --> 00:15:49,978
Give me a grandchild
or I will have you replaced.

114
00:15:51,156 --> 00:15:53,021
Mother, that's enough.

115
00:15:54,026 --> 00:15:57,120
Do not come out until you make a child.

116
00:15:58,797 --> 00:16:00,321
Two would be better!

117
00:16:00,566 --> 00:16:01,498
What?

118
00:16:03,168 --> 00:16:05,159
Twins you oaf.

119
00:16:13,912 --> 00:16:14,674
Mother.

120
00:16:15,647 --> 00:16:19,981
Can you go away?
He says he can't with you sitting there.

121
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:21,784
Just get busy.

122
00:16:23,055 --> 00:16:24,352
Mom...

123
00:16:28,994 --> 00:16:30,461
She's gone.

124
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:16,769
Mother, what do you say we should
have at the feast tonight?

125
00:17:17,042 --> 00:17:19,738
I have tapir...
but I also found this boy.

126
00:17:20,446 --> 00:17:21,174
I say boy.

127
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,278
Roasted!

128
00:17:22,548 --> 00:17:25,176
The tapir smells better.
I think it's more fresh.

129
00:17:25,584 --> 00:17:27,518
No Dad! No! It's me! It's me!

130
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:30,517
I'll just hang the boy here
in case we change our minds.

131
00:17:34,093 --> 00:17:34,787
Wait...

132
00:17:34,993 --> 00:17:37,860
That's our Turtles Run.
That's our eldest.

133
00:17:38,063 --> 00:17:40,531
Yes it's me. It's your eldest!

134
00:17:41,433 --> 00:17:44,732
In that case, a crush for my eldest...

135
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,638
...and a crush for my youngest.

136
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,242
Tapir it is.

137
00:19:00,345 --> 00:19:01,778
One day, old man!

138
00:19:02,347 --> 00:19:04,645
One day you won't be able
to run anymore!

139
00:19:22,367 --> 00:19:25,495
And a Man sat alone.

140
00:19:26,939 --> 00:19:29,464
Drenched deep in sadness.

141
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:32,973
And all the animals
drew near to him and said:

142
00:19:33,612 --> 00:19:37,412
"We do not like to see you so sad...

143
00:19:39,218 --> 00:19:42,654
"Ask us for whatever you wish
and you shall have it."

144
00:19:43,689 --> 00:19:48,058
The Man said:
"I want to have good sight."

145
00:19:49,461 --> 00:19:52,658
The vulture replied:
"You shall have mine."

146
00:19:55,701 --> 00:19:58,898
The Man said: "I want to be strong."

147
00:20:02,608 --> 00:20:04,371
The jaguar said:

148
00:20:06,745 --> 00:20:09,680
"You shall be strong like me."

149
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:17,520
Then the Man said: "I long
to know the secrets of the earth."

150
00:20:19,091 --> 00:20:24,051
The serpent replied:
"I will show them to you."

151
00:20:25,964 --> 00:20:28,455
And so it went with all the animals.

152
00:20:30,168 --> 00:20:32,898
And when the Man had
all the gifts that they could give...

153
00:20:33,105 --> 00:20:34,732
...he left.

154
00:20:36,308 --> 00:20:38,572
Then the owl said to the other animals:

155
00:20:39,511 --> 00:20:43,379
"Now the Man knows much
and is able to do many things...

156
00:20:44,483 --> 00:20:47,816
"Suddenly I am afraid."

157
00:20:51,023 --> 00:20:53,821
The deer said:
"The Man has all that he needs."

158
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,951
"Now his sadness will stop."

159
00:20:57,596 --> 00:20:59,587
But the owl replied: "No."

160
00:21:02,267 --> 00:21:05,134
"I saw a hole in the Man...

161
00:21:06,138 --> 00:21:09,904
"Deep like a hunger
he will never fill...

162
00:21:10,942 --> 00:21:15,436
"It is what makes him sad
and what makes him want."

163
00:21:18,717 --> 00:21:21,777
"He will go on taking and taking...

164
00:21:22,988 --> 00:21:26,185
"Until one day the World will say:

165
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:31,088
"I am no more
and I have nothing left to give."

166
00:22:17,843 --> 00:22:19,674
Come back to me...

167
00:22:24,015 --> 00:22:25,880
Come back to me.

168
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,771
My son is dancing.

169
00:22:58,483 --> 00:23:00,610
Your son is happy.

170
00:23:53,004 --> 00:23:54,665
What do you want?

171
00:24:10,689 --> 00:24:12,418
Run!

172
00:24:27,973 --> 00:24:32,000
Now that you're up,
can you please kill that dog?

173
00:24:45,156 --> 00:24:47,215
The dog.

174
00:26:14,846 --> 00:26:16,438
Get up! Get up! Now!

175
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,782
Go to the forest.

176
00:27:34,225 --> 00:27:36,056
Run! Do not look back.

177
00:28:01,853 --> 00:28:03,684
No! No! I am afraid!

178
00:28:04,055 --> 00:28:06,080
Look into my eyes. Look into my eyes.

179
00:28:06,424 --> 00:28:07,482
Be strong...

180
00:28:07,926 --> 00:28:09,018
I am afraid!

181
00:28:09,627 --> 00:28:11,151
Be strong.

182
00:29:09,587 --> 00:29:10,451
Tie him up!

183
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,624
Father!

184
00:30:31,035 --> 00:30:33,196
The others. I have to help.

185
00:30:34,339 --> 00:30:36,068
No, don't leave us!

186
00:30:36,374 --> 00:30:39,036
I will come back, I promise.

187
00:30:39,344 --> 00:30:40,538
Don't you leave!

188
00:30:40,845 --> 00:30:41,675
I promise.

189
00:30:41,746 --> 00:30:42,644
Stay, please stay.

190
00:30:42,881 --> 00:30:44,007
Father, don't go.

191
00:31:40,638 --> 00:31:42,037
Very nice.

192
00:32:29,053 --> 00:32:30,077
Stop!

193
00:32:38,896 --> 00:32:40,193
Tie him up!

194
00:32:44,569 --> 00:32:45,968
I want him alive.

195
00:33:06,524 --> 00:33:07,786
Sorry Father.

196
00:33:26,911 --> 00:33:28,811
That's enough!

197
00:33:39,424 --> 00:33:41,187
Stand him up.

198
00:33:48,933 --> 00:33:50,560
Move away.

199
00:34:04,415 --> 00:34:06,178
My son.

200
00:34:17,061 --> 00:34:18,858
Don't be afraid.

201
00:35:17,188 --> 00:35:19,656
Almost...

202
00:35:34,572 --> 00:35:37,166
...that's your name.

203
00:35:38,176 --> 00:35:41,339
"Almost".

204
00:35:57,228 --> 00:35:59,696
Our life is over.

205
00:36:05,102 --> 00:36:06,399
Shame...

206
00:36:14,445 --> 00:36:15,673
Shame!

207
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:21,909
Cowards!

208
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,362
Let's move!

209
00:42:17,041 --> 00:42:18,406
We move out now.

210
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:20,242
They are back.

211
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,611
Get up!

212
00:42:27,418 --> 00:42:28,851
Heave!

213
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,790
Cut Rock, you forgot to duck.

214
00:42:41,799 --> 00:42:43,096
Hold still.

215
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:53,936
Can you see?

216
00:42:56,347 --> 00:42:57,279
Yes.

217
00:42:57,748 --> 00:42:59,545
Get back to your line.

218
00:44:00,978 --> 00:44:02,172
Come with us...

219
00:44:54,531 --> 00:44:55,725
Get up.

220
00:45:08,312 --> 00:45:10,576
Leave him alone, "Almost".

221
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:14,615
I said get up.

222
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,909
Up, up...

223
00:45:45,415 --> 00:45:46,973
...that's it.

224
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:50,450
Let's go!

225
00:45:54,324 --> 00:45:57,225
This man is a good friend of yours...

226
00:46:32,129 --> 00:46:34,097
Don't worry...

227
00:46:37,668 --> 00:46:39,636
I'll take care of them.

228
00:46:42,573 --> 00:46:44,871
They are mine now.

229
00:46:52,149 --> 00:46:56,210
Gentle lxchel. Tender mother of mercy.

230
00:46:58,055 --> 00:47:03,186
Keep them from harm. Please. Keep them.

231
00:47:39,096 --> 00:47:40,688
One more.

232
00:48:04,321 --> 00:48:06,016
Ready?

233
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:08,508
Hold on! Hold on!

234
00:49:12,456 --> 00:49:14,014
Wait...

235
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:17,356
...let's see what happens.

236
00:49:25,369 --> 00:49:26,267
That's it!

237
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:34,704
Hurry!

238
00:49:35,679 --> 00:49:37,613
Pull! Be strong!

239
00:49:56,666 --> 00:49:58,497
Yes! You did it!

240
00:50:02,372 --> 00:50:04,033
Good work!

241
00:50:16,853 --> 00:50:19,583
Can you breathe? Good.

242
00:50:49,386 --> 00:50:50,284
Wait here.

243
00:51:23,653 --> 00:51:25,314
What's become of my capture?

244
00:51:29,126 --> 00:51:30,559
Dead weight.

245
00:51:32,262 --> 00:51:34,492
He nearly took the rest with him.

246
00:51:36,766 --> 00:51:38,461
I let him go.

247
00:51:42,706 --> 00:51:44,435
You. Let him go?

248
00:51:51,515 --> 00:51:55,007
Shall we now do what you want?

249
00:51:59,356 --> 00:52:02,325
Let us try that.

250
00:52:25,582 --> 00:52:28,380
Don't let any others go.

251
00:52:35,058 --> 00:52:36,320
Let's move.

252
00:52:51,608 --> 00:52:53,735
Get up "Almost".

253
00:52:54,844 --> 00:52:58,405
We don't want to lose you just yet.

254
00:53:48,598 --> 00:53:50,589
Stand up, boy.

255
00:53:59,342 --> 00:54:01,867
You proved yourself today, my son.

256
00:54:02,579 --> 00:54:06,379
You're now worthy to stand
with the rest of us.

257
00:54:08,952 --> 00:54:11,477
Thank you Father.

258
00:54:21,531 --> 00:54:22,930
Take it...

259
00:54:23,667 --> 00:54:24,895
...it's yours.

260
00:54:29,005 --> 00:54:31,633
It has taken many lives.

261
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:45,453
Get some rest.

262
00:54:59,969 --> 00:55:01,129
Resting brothers...

263
00:55:01,404 --> 00:55:04,771
...fathers, mothers, wives.

264
00:55:05,809 --> 00:55:09,973
You felt the cold
of this day's early morning.

265
00:55:10,914 --> 00:55:15,112
Now you cannot feel
the coldness of its night.

266
00:55:17,821 --> 00:55:19,812
She stopped screaming...

267
00:55:22,025 --> 00:55:24,994
...too long before they returned,
she had stopped screaming.

268
00:55:25,862 --> 00:55:28,524
We saw how she fought them.

269
00:55:29,566 --> 00:55:31,397
But in the final moment?

270
00:55:33,002 --> 00:55:34,902
If she let them...

271
00:55:37,574 --> 00:55:42,204
...the Goddess of the Scaffold
shows no mercy for the weakness...

272
00:55:44,247 --> 00:55:48,707
Her soul waits for yours
in the shade of the Ceiba Tree.

273
00:55:59,896 --> 00:56:01,591
I need to know.

274
00:56:03,099 --> 00:56:07,900
Before this day's end
I will leave this world.

275
00:56:09,806 --> 00:56:15,267
I will take as many
of these bastard dogs with me as I can.

276
00:56:17,614 --> 00:56:22,415
And I will gladly embrace
the torments of hell...

277
00:56:24,587 --> 00:56:27,954
...if I do not find my Sky Flower there.

278
00:56:34,998 --> 00:56:36,465
Don't rain.

279
00:57:19,809 --> 00:57:21,606
I am walking here.

280
00:57:54,410 --> 00:57:56,435
Keep away, she has the sickness.

281
00:58:22,038 --> 00:58:23,699
Get back!

282
00:59:16,593 --> 00:59:18,720
You fear me?

283
00:59:20,129 --> 00:59:22,723
So you should...

284
00:59:23,399 --> 00:59:26,800
...all you who are vile.

285
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:33,366
Would you like to know how you will die?

286
00:59:40,416 --> 00:59:44,250
The sacred time is near...

287
00:59:46,422 --> 00:59:50,586
Beware the blackness of day.

288
00:59:53,796 --> 00:59:58,563
Beware the man who brings the jaguar.

289
01:00:01,471 --> 01:00:06,135
Behold him reborn from mud and earth...

290
01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:13,080
For the one he takes you to
will cancel the sky...

291
01:00:14,217 --> 01:00:17,084
...and scratch out the earth.

292
01:00:18,221 --> 01:00:20,519
Scratch you out.

293
01:00:21,791 --> 01:00:24,487
And end your world.

294
01:00:31,067 --> 01:00:34,195
He's with us now.

295
01:00:41,177 --> 01:00:44,010
...day will be like night.

296
01:00:44,547 --> 01:00:49,109
And the man jaguar
will lead you to your end.

297
01:02:00,089 --> 01:02:02,353
Where are they taking us?

298
01:02:06,662 --> 01:02:11,065
We tell stories of a place stone-built.

299
01:02:12,602 --> 01:02:14,126
What happens there?

300
01:02:15,071 --> 01:02:16,470
I do not know...

301
01:02:18,007 --> 01:02:21,534
...but the earth bleeds.

302
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:26,480
We are near.

303
01:03:08,191 --> 01:03:09,783
Salvation!

304
01:03:10,393 --> 01:03:13,453
He has the laughing sickness.

305
01:03:14,463 --> 01:03:16,488
He likes you!

306
01:03:19,068 --> 01:03:20,296
Help me!

307
01:03:28,678 --> 01:03:30,509
Save me.

308
01:03:38,421 --> 01:03:39,979
Die like a man.

309
01:06:20,583 --> 01:06:21,675
Welcome back.

310
01:06:22,818 --> 01:06:24,285
Have you been successful?

311
01:06:24,887 --> 01:06:25,979
Ask my son.

312
01:06:27,923 --> 01:06:29,288
How many captives?

313
01:06:29,525 --> 01:06:30,492
Deal with my son.

314
01:06:32,595 --> 01:06:33,653
A fair price.

315
01:06:35,097 --> 01:06:36,860
As always, trust me.

316
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:38,359
Good.

317
01:06:56,218 --> 01:06:58,914
How much will you give me?

318
01:08:00,649 --> 01:08:02,549
Who will buy this woman?

319
01:08:03,619 --> 01:08:04,984
No... she's too old.

320
01:08:06,322 --> 01:08:08,119
She can be useful.

321
01:08:08,624 --> 01:08:10,319
She can cook... clean...

322
01:08:11,861 --> 01:08:13,920
Useless old woman!

323
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,124
No sale.

324
01:08:24,874 --> 01:08:26,239
Go!

325
01:08:27,343 --> 01:08:28,605
Go on.

326
01:13:29,411 --> 01:13:33,711
These are the days of our great lament.

327
01:13:38,187 --> 01:13:40,087
The land thirsts.

328
01:13:42,524 --> 01:13:46,927
A great plague infests our crops.

329
01:13:49,765 --> 01:13:53,826
The scourge of sickness
afflicts us at whim.

330
01:13:59,842 --> 01:14:03,437
They say this strife has made us weak.

331
01:14:05,681 --> 01:14:07,512
That we have become empty.

332
01:14:10,319 --> 01:14:12,583
They say that we rot.

333
01:14:24,299 --> 01:14:27,166
Great people of the banner of the sun...

334
01:14:28,003 --> 01:14:29,470
I say...

335
01:14:30,672 --> 01:14:32,469
...we are strong.

336
01:14:36,979 --> 01:14:39,038
We are a people of destiny.

337
01:14:43,852 --> 01:14:47,117
Destined to be the masters of time.

338
01:14:51,193 --> 01:14:54,458
Destined to be nearest to the gods.

339
01:15:10,412 --> 01:15:13,540
Mighty Kukulkan!

340
01:15:15,183 --> 01:15:19,711
Whose fury could scorch
this earth to oblivion...

341
01:15:22,357 --> 01:15:24,655
Let us appease you with this sacrifice.

342
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:27,057
To exalt you in your glory.

343
01:15:27,930 --> 01:15:30,524
To make our people prosper.

344
01:15:31,633 --> 01:15:34,363
To prepare for your return.

345
01:15:37,439 --> 01:15:40,203
Warrior, unafraid and willing!

346
01:15:40,776 --> 01:15:43,108
With your blood you renew the world!

347
01:15:43,645 --> 01:15:45,442
From age to age.

348
01:15:46,882 --> 01:15:48,509
Thanks be to you.

349
01:16:03,265 --> 01:16:05,426
The heart of god!

350
01:18:49,162 --> 01:18:51,426
Come back to me.

351
01:19:00,374 --> 01:19:02,239
Brother...

352
01:19:04,144 --> 01:19:05,941
Journey well...

353
01:19:08,115 --> 01:19:09,013
No.

354
01:19:10,517 --> 01:19:11,643
I can't go.

355
01:19:13,186 --> 01:19:14,744
Not now...

356
01:21:34,494 --> 01:21:39,329
People of the banner
of the sun do not fear.

357
01:21:40,267 --> 01:21:42,098
Rejoice!

358
01:21:43,370 --> 01:21:46,396
Kukulkan has drunk his fill of blood.

359
01:21:46,773 --> 01:21:49,571
We have sated his thirst.

360
01:21:50,711 --> 01:21:52,406
Great god.

361
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:55,610
Show us that you are pleased.

362
01:21:55,882 --> 01:21:59,477
Let your light return upon us.

363
01:23:04,851 --> 01:23:06,910
What of these captives?

364
01:23:11,625 --> 01:23:13,525
Dispose of them.

365
01:23:47,961 --> 01:23:50,122
I need a finisher.

366
01:23:55,168 --> 01:23:56,465
You.

367
01:24:02,576 --> 01:24:04,134
Release them.

368
01:24:12,419 --> 01:24:14,046
You watch.

369
01:24:34,941 --> 01:24:35,999
I'm ready!

370
01:24:41,014 --> 01:24:43,983
There's your jungle beyond the corn.

371
01:24:46,953 --> 01:24:48,352
Go to it.

372
01:24:49,189 --> 01:24:50,588
You're free...

373
01:24:52,459 --> 01:24:53,824
...now run.

374
01:24:57,163 --> 01:24:58,494
I said run.

375
01:25:02,903 --> 01:25:04,165
Run!

376
01:26:17,811 --> 01:26:18,903
Not bad.

377
01:26:37,063 --> 01:26:38,394
Your turn.

378
01:26:46,239 --> 01:26:47,763
Run.

379
01:28:03,650 --> 01:28:05,117
Run!

380
01:29:19,626 --> 01:29:21,184
Sleep.

381
01:29:22,162 --> 01:29:24,392
Sleep, sleep now my son.

382
01:29:25,465 --> 01:29:27,797
The pain will be no more.

383
01:29:29,769 --> 01:29:31,031
Sleep.

384
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:23,247
He didn't come this way.

385
01:35:36,536 --> 01:35:38,504
He's in the trees.

386
01:35:40,273 --> 01:35:41,501
Spread out.

387
01:35:42,375 --> 01:35:43,899
Keep your eyes up.

388
01:36:06,299 --> 01:36:07,357
Quiet.

389
01:36:18,978 --> 01:36:20,172
He's coming right at us.

390
01:36:36,896 --> 01:36:37,555
There!

391
01:38:35,781 --> 01:38:38,511
He would have wanted me to have it.

392
01:38:40,686 --> 01:38:43,621
The omen is bad...

393
01:38:45,558 --> 01:38:48,618
Mighty Ek Chuah we beg you...

394
01:38:49,895 --> 01:38:54,127
Forgive us for this trespass
against your son the Jaguar.

395
01:38:56,135 --> 01:38:58,626
The omen is bad...

396
01:39:00,372 --> 01:39:02,340
Lift yourself up Drunkards Four...

397
01:39:03,209 --> 01:39:06,201
...the omen was foretold...

398
01:39:08,581 --> 01:39:11,778
...and now we have a fear more grave...

399
01:39:12,752 --> 01:39:16,153
...today I saw the day
become like night...

400
01:39:22,695 --> 01:39:26,324
I saw a man run with the Jaguar...

401
01:39:30,236 --> 01:39:34,332
...we must not let this man
make feet from us.

402
01:39:35,074 --> 01:39:36,234
Enough.

403
01:39:40,012 --> 01:39:41,877
Your words mean nothing.

404
01:39:43,249 --> 01:39:45,479
He runs because he is afraid.

405
01:39:46,852 --> 01:39:50,481
When I catch him,
I will peel his skin...

406
01:39:53,526 --> 01:39:56,256
...and have him watch me wear it.

407
01:40:03,969 --> 01:40:05,197
We leave now.

408
01:42:12,831 --> 01:42:14,025
Stay back.

409
01:43:24,970 --> 01:43:26,096
Here!

410
01:43:50,662 --> 01:43:52,789
The omen was bad...

411
01:43:56,502 --> 01:43:57,628
He's fucked.

412
01:44:00,939 --> 01:44:02,338
Help... please...

413
01:44:03,175 --> 01:44:04,437
Hanging Moss...

414
01:44:06,111 --> 01:44:07,738
See him out.

415
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:31,863
Open your veins. It's quicker.

416
01:44:44,583 --> 01:44:46,676
Travel well.

417
01:47:52,504 --> 01:47:55,234
So much for your prophecies.

418
01:48:01,113 --> 01:48:02,341
It's not over!

419
01:48:28,373 --> 01:48:30,000
I am Jaguar Paw...

420
01:48:30,709 --> 01:48:32,267
Son of Flint Sky...

421
01:48:33,712 --> 01:48:37,079
My father hunted
this forest before me...

422
01:48:38,817 --> 01:48:40,785
My name is Jaguar Paw.

423
01:48:41,620 --> 01:48:43,212
I am a hunter.

424
01:48:44,823 --> 01:48:47,087
This is my forest.

425
01:48:48,260 --> 01:48:52,788
And my sons will hunt it
with their sons after I am gone...

426
01:48:55,667 --> 01:48:56,895
Come on!

427
01:48:59,571 --> 01:49:01,266
We are going over.

428
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:04,570
We climb down around.

429
01:49:05,844 --> 01:49:07,937
We cannot let him get away.

430
01:49:08,647 --> 01:49:09,773
We cannot afford...

431
01:49:30,001 --> 01:49:32,128
We all jump.

432
01:52:29,147 --> 01:52:30,774
I am Jaguar Paw.

433
01:52:32,651 --> 01:52:34,482
This is my forest.

434
01:52:36,555 --> 01:52:39,251
And I am not afraid.

435
01:54:46,685 --> 01:54:49,245
You go. I'll wait here.

436
02:00:18,783 --> 02:00:20,580
Almost...

437
02:00:47,445 --> 02:00:50,141
Resting fathers, fly me your strength.

438
02:01:17,175 --> 02:01:18,938
Get up here.

439
02:01:33,825 --> 02:01:35,383
Go back!

440
02:02:04,789 --> 02:02:05,483
Quick!

441
02:02:06,090 --> 02:02:07,057
Hurry up!

442
02:08:33,911 --> 02:08:35,776
What are they?

443
02:08:37,448 --> 02:08:39,279
They bring men.

444
02:08:43,921 --> 02:08:45,821
Should we go to them?

445
02:08:54,131 --> 02:08:55,928
We should go to the forest.

446
02:09:02,840 --> 02:09:04,740
To seek a new beginning.

447
02:09:09,880 --> 02:09:11,313
Come Turtles Run...
