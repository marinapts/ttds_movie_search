00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:18,996
- <i>Richard! Richard!</i>
- He's not gonna answer the question. Frank.

169
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:21,532
- I wanted to kill myself-
- Don't listen to him.

170
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,761
- <i>I was very unhappy.</i>
- <i>He's sick in his head.</i>

171
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:26,269
- Richard!
- I'm sorry! I don't think it's
an appropriate conversation...

172
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,533
- for a seven-year-old.
- She's gonna find out anyway.

173
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:32,543
- Okay.
- Go on, Frank.

174
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,978
Why were you unhappy?

175
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:41,541
Um, well, there are a lot of reasons.

176
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:46,557
Mainly, though, I fell in love
with someone who didn't love me back.

177
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,217
Who?

178
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:51,558
<i>One of my grad students.</i>
<i>I was very much in love with him.</i>

179
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,030
Him?

180
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:58,467
<i>It was a boy?</i>
<i>You fell in love with a boy?</i>

181
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:01,699
- Yes, I did. Very much so.
- That's silly.

182
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:04,503
<i>You're right. It was silly.</i>
<i>It was very, very silly.</i>

183
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,670
- There's another word for it.
- Dad.

184
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,682
- So, that's when you tried to kill yourself?
- <i>Well, no.</i>

185
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:15,345
The boy that I was in love with fell in love
with another man- Larry Sugarman.

186
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:17,718
- Who's Larry Sugarman?
- Larry Sugarman is, perhaps...

187
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:20,986
the second most highly regarded
Proust scholar in the U.S.

188
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:24,654
- Who's number one?
- That would be me, Rich.

189
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:27,163
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

190
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,393
So that's when.

191
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,867
No. What happened was
I was a bit upset...

192
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:34,269
so I said some things
that I shouldn't have said...

193
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,500
<i>and I did some things</i>
<i>that I shouldn't have done...</i>

194
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,668
and subsequently
I was fired from my job...

195
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:41,940
<i>and forced to move out of my apartment</i>
<i>and move into a motel.</i>

196
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:45,608
[Blowing Nose]

197
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,209
- And that's when you tried to-
- <i>Well, no.</i>

198
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,515
Actually, all of that was okay.

199
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:55,219
What happened was two days ago the
MacArthur Foundation, in its infinite wisdom...

200
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:59,525
<i>awarded a genius grant</i>
<i>to Larry Sugarman.</i>

201
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,896
And that's when l-

202
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,595
<i>Decided to check out early.</i>

203
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:08,264
Yes. Yes. And I failed
at that as well.

204
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:12,367
<i>Olive, the important thing</i>
<i>to understand here...</i>

205
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,708
<i>is that Uncle Frank</i>
<i>gave up on himself.</i>

206
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:18,749
He made a series of foolish choices-
I'm sorry- and he gave up on himself...

207
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:21,411
which is something winners never do.

208
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,286
So that's the story, okay?
Now, everyone, just let's move on and, uh-

209
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:29,555
- <i>[Sheryl Continues]</i>
- Is he always like this? How can you stand it?

210
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:33,564
Olive, tell him about your
routine while you're doing this.

211
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:37,568
Okay. Little Miss Chili Pepper is
a beauty contest for everyone in Albuquerque...

212
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,798
but you have to be six or seven
and you have to be a girl.

213
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:43,067
This is our sister.

214
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:44,733
- Cindy.
- Spring break.

215
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:47,209
Dwayne went to see his dad
in Florida for two weeks...

216
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,679
and Olive went to Laguna
to see her cousins.

217
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:54,185
- She made it to the top
of the regionals out there.
- I was in second place.

218
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,277
Well, what do you think
your chances are?

219
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:59,357
I think I can win,
because some of the other girls...

220
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,859
<i>they've been doing it longer,</i>
<i>but I practice every day.</i>

221
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,829
- Yeah. Good luck.
- Not about luck, Frank.

222
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:08,422
<i>Luck is the name losers give</i>
<i>to their own failings.</i>

223
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:11,367
It's about wanting to win,
willing yourself to win.

224
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,166
- You've got to want it badder than anybody else.
- I do.

225
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,605
- Then you're gonna be a winner.
- <i>[Sheryl] Richard.</i>

226
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:17,776
It's the truth.

227
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:18,674
It's the truth.

228
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,870
<i>You know, actually, there is a message</i>
<i>from Cindy on the machine.</i>

229
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,040
Something about Little Mrs. Sunshine.

230
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:27,516
- What? Little Miss Sunshine?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

231
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,348
What?

232
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:36,690
- <i>[Machine Beeps]</i>
- <i>[Woman On Machine] Sheryl, it's Cindy.</i>

233
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:38,695
Remember when Olive
was here last month?

234
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:41,231
She was runner-up in the
regional Little Miss Sunshine?

235
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,825
<i>Theyjust called right now and said that</i>
<i>the girl who won had to forfeit her crown.</i>

236
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:47,838
I don't know why.
Something about diet pills.

237
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,398
- Now she has a place in the state
contest in Redondo Beach!
- [Screaming]

238
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,536
- <i>[Continues, Indistinct]</i>
- [Screaming Continues]

239
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:56,807
Oh, my gosh! I won!
I won! I won! I won!

240
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:58,815
- <i>[Richard] Finish your dinner!</i>
- I'm finished!

241
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:01,545
- What happened?
- I'm just calling to- Cindy!

242
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:05,885
Yeah, we just got it.
Yeah, she basically went crazy.

243
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:08,653
- <i>[Olive] I won! I won! I won!</i>
- No, I didn't get that.

244
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:12,925
- The machine cut you off. Okay.
- <i>[Olive Continues, Indistinct]</i>

245
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:16,433
<i>Redondo Beach. This Sunday?</i>

246
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:20,596
- <i>Wh-Are you guys going?</i>
- [Whispering] Yes.

247
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,834
- Can you put it off?
- They have to. They have to.

248
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:26,570
- Where does that leave us?
- We can't do it. We can't.

249
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:29,408
No, no- No, I understand
that, Cindy. Yeah.

250
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:33,007
- They-
- I just- No, I'll just
figure it out. Okay, bye-bye.

251
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:36,053
It's this Sunday?
Why can'tJeff and Cindy take her?

252
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,180
They have some equestrian
thing in Santa Barbara.

253
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:41,020
You know, they do that horse
shit every single weekend.

254
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:44,789
Well, it's the nationals. They're taking
both horses, so apparently it's a big deal.

255
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,388
What about Olive?

256
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:52,630
Little Miss Sunshine!
Little Miss Sunshine! I won!

257
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,933
I won!

258
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,133
I'm going! We're going!

259
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,642
- You promised?
- We'll fly out and come back Monday.

260
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,213
- How are you gonna get around out there?
- We'll rent a car.

261
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,805
- And stay at a hotel?
- We can afford it.

262
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,148
- This is our seed money.
- Well, if I had a little help bringin' it in.

263
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,551
- Don't start that.
- It all goes to your nine steps!

264
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,988
I told you I'm gonna talk
to Stan Grossman!

265
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,653
We're gonna get locked and loaded on this
deal and start generating some income!

266
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,663
- But in the meantime we've gotta be-
- <i>Okay, okay! We'll drive!</i>

267
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,859
- I'm not drivin'.
- How are you gonna fit Grandpa in the Miata?

268
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:25,766
- <i>Well, Grandpa does not have to come.</i>
- What? I coached her!

269
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:28,135
I gave her the moves.
I gotta go.

270
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,437
- Why don't you take the V. W?
- I cannot drive a shift. I tried.

271
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:33,943
- We'll fly there.
- <i>We can't afford it.</i>

272
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:38,676
Well, that's what we're gonna do
unless you have a better idea.

273
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,082
Here. This is dessert.

274
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:47,118
<i>I won! I won!</i>
<i>I won! I won! I won!</i>

275
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,694
I won! I won! I won!

276
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,996
<i>Miss Sunshine! Little Miss Sunshine!</i>
<i>Little Miss Sunshine!</i>

277
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:00,128
All right.
I'll drive the bus.

278
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:04,005
Richard, I was told explicitly
not to leave Frank by himself.

279
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,009
- No offense, Frank.
- None taken.

280
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,602
You got Dwayne here.
They can look after each other.

281
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:11,683
No, Richard! That's asking too much.
If something happened-

282
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:15,310
We can't go, then, unless
Dwayne and Frank go with us.

283
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:19,379
- <i>[Olive] Mom, where's my bathing suit?</i>
- Right.

284
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:22,657
Frank?

285
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:25,093
- <i>I found it!</i>
- <i>[Door Slams]</i>

286
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:27,097
Okay.

287
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,660
<i>I'm going! I'm going!</i>
<i>I'm going!</i>

288
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:34,535
Oh, Dwayne, come on, please.
Think of your sister.

289
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,508
<i>[Richard] Come on, Dwayne.</i>
<i>It'll be a lot of fun.</i>

290
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,078
<i>You can go to the beach and-</i>

291
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:47,710
<i>[Frank]</i>
<i>"This is unfair.</i>

292
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:52,119
"All I ask is...

293
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:55,591
<i>that you leave me alone. "

294
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,593
Dwayne, flight school.

295
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,101
I will give you permission
for flight school.

296
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:10,369
<i>[Olive] I won! I won! I won! I won!</i>
<i>I'm gonna win this one too!</i>

297
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:22,947
"But I'm not going...

298
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:26,218
to have any fun."

299
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:29,021
<i>Yeah, we're all with you</i>
<i>on that one, Dwayne.</i>

300
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:31,687
Grandpa! Grandpa!
Is Grandpa coming to California?

301
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:34,459
- <i>We're all coming, honey.</i>
- [Richard] Hey, uh, hold on.

302
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,557
Olive, come over here
for a second.

303
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:39,136
<i>Come here.</i>
<i>Sit down for a second.</i>

304
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:43,698
Look, there's no sense
in entering a contest...

305
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:46,073
if you don't think
you're gonna win.

306
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:50,740
So do you think you can win
Little Miss Sunshine?

307
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:53,613
<i>Richard-</i>

308
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:56,449
Are you gonna win?

309
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:01,652
Yes!

310
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,322
We're going to California.
[Laughs]

311
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:15,197
Good night, Dwayne.

312
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,708
<i>[Writing]</i>

313
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:35,418
<i>Not on your watch.</i>
<i>I wouldn't do that to you.</i>

314
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:46,763
<i>[Sighs]</i>
<i>Thank you, Dwayne.</i>

315
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:51,440
Coming from you,
that means a lot.

316
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:53,443
Good night.

317
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:48,562
Jesus, I'm tired.
I'm so fucking tired.

318
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,567
Do you know how tired I am?

319
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:54,105
If some girl came up to me,
begged me to fuck her, I couldn't do it.

320
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:57,539
- Dad? Watch the language, huh?
- <i>That's how tired I am.</i>

321
00:22:57,642 --> 00:22:59,610
She's listening to music.

322
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,407
Olive, I'll give you a million dollars
if you turn around.

323
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:04,505
- <i>See?</i>
- All right.

324
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:06,709
- But the rest of us.
- <i>Oh, the rest of you.</i>

325
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:09,514
Can I give you some advice?

326
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:12,613
Well, I'm gonna
give it to you anyway.

327
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:16,922
- I don't want you making
the same mistakes I made.
- Can't wait to hear this.

328
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:19,963
Dwayne-That's your name,
right? Dwayne?

329
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,966
<i>This is the voice</i>
<i>of experience talking.</i>

330
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:26,128
<i>Are you listening?</i>
<i>Fuck a lot of women, Dwayne.</i>

- You can tell me, Dwayne. Are you gettin' any?

- <i>Come on, please.</i>
- No? Jesus. You're what, 15?

335
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:40,215
- My God, man!
- <i>Dad!</i>

<i>That young stuff is the best in the world.</i>

- Will you kindly not interrupt!

338

See, right now you're jailbait.
They're jailbait. It's perfect.

339
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:53,827
I mean, you hit 18- Man, you're
talking about three to five.

340
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,900
Hey, I will pull
this truck over right now!

341
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:59,334
So pull the truck over!
Fuck you! I can say what I want.

342

- [Horn Toots]

- Frank, don't encourage him.

<i>I paid my money. They took my money.</i>

- You started snorting heroin?

348
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:20,748
- I'm old!
- Well, that stuff'll kill you.

349
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:23,953
What am I, an idiot?
And don't you start taking that shit.

350
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:26,257
When you're young,
you're crazy to do that stuff.

351
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:29,458
- What about you?
- I'm old. When you're old,
you're crazy not to do it.

352
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:33,527
<i>We've tried. Believe me. The intervention</i>
<i>was a fiasco. He's worse than a two-year-old.</i>

353
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,539
Can we please talk
about something else?

354
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:39,838
- <i>[Frank] I take it you didn't</i>
<i>like it at Sunset Manor.</i>
- Frank.

355
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:42,209
Are you kidding me?
It was a fuckin' paradise.

356
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,373
They got a pool.
They got golf.

357
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:47,611
Now I'm stuck with Mr. Happy here,
sleepin' on a fuckin' sofa.

358
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:51,712
<i>Look, I know you're a homo and all,</i>
<i>but maybe you can appreciate this.</i>

359

You go to one of those places,
there's four women for every guy.

360
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,860
- Can you imagine what that's like?
- You must've been very busy.

361
00:24:57,963 --> 00:25:01,296
Whoa! I had second-degree burns
on my johnson. I kid you not.

362
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:03,390
- Really?
- <i>Forget about it.</i>

363
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,470
What are you guys
talking about?

364
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,504
Politics.

365
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,131
Oh.

366
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:15,303
Fuck a lot of women, kid.
I have no reason to lie to you.

367
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:18,576
Not one woman.
A lot of women.

368
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:23,482
<i>You heard what I said?</i>
<i>Did it go in anywhere?</i>

369
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:25,488
[Richard] Yeah, I think
we get the point, Dad.

370
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:28,388
[Grandpa] Don't show me the pad.
I don't want to see the fuckin' pad.

371
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,192
Mom, how much can we spend?

372
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:38,065
<i>I would say four dollars.</i>
<i>Anything under four dollars.</i>

373
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:40,364
Hi. You ready?

374
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:43,703
Yeah, I'm gonna have the,
uh, number five with coffee, please.

375
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:45,708
<i>All right.</i>

376
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:48,540
A number seven, over easy,
and a grapefruit juice.

377
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:52,413
- Grapefruit. Okay.
- I would like a fruit plate.

378
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:54,451
- And do you have chamomile?
- <i>Yes.</i>

379
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:58,216
- <i>With honey, please.</i>
- <i>[Frank] I would like</i>
<i>the lumberjack and coffee.</i>

380
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:01,622
- And extra bacon.
- <i>Extra.</i>

381
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,956
- Now, Dad, you should probably-
- Richard, don't start.

382
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,962
- He's gonna kill himself.
- Well, it's his life.

383
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,055
- Thank you, Sheryl.
- <i>[Waitress] Garden salad?</i>

384
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:10,031
And you.

385
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:13,536
- L- I'm sorry. I, um- Sorry.
- <i>Take your time.</i>

386
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:16,266
<i>Don't apologize, Olive.</i>
<i>It's a sign of weakness.</i>

387
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:20,037
<i>Um, well, I want- Okay, okay.</i>
<i>I know what I want. I know.</i>

388
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:24,377
Okay, can I get
the waffles and, uh-

389
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:27,315
I don't-
What does "alamodey" mean?

390
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,513
- Oh, that means it comes with ice cream.
- Okay, "alamodey" then.

391
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:34,114
- <i>[Sheryl] Olive, for breakfast?</i>
- You said four dollars.

392
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:37,092
Okay. You're right.
Thank you.

393
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:38,822
Okay. Be right back.

394
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:42,024
<i>Actually, Olive,</i>
<i>" la mode"in French...</i>

395
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:45,728
translates literally
as "in the fashion."

396
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:47,964
 la mode.

397
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:52,009
<i>"Mode"is derived from Latin</i> modus,
<i>meaning "due or proper measure."</i>

398
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,374
- Frank, shut up.
- <i>[Sheryl] Richard!</i>

399
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:57,209
<i>Olive, can I tell you a little</i>
<i>something about ice cream?</i>

400
00:26:57,315 --> 00:27:00,045
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Well, ice cream is made from cream...

401
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:02,016
which comes from cow's milk...

402
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,816
and cream has a lot of fat in it.

403
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:06,823
- Richard.
- What?

404
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:10,656
- She's gonna find out anyway, remember?
- What? Find out what?

405
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:15,699
Well, when you eat ice cream, the fat
in the ice cream becomes fat in your body.

406
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,995
- <i>[Sheryl] Richard, I swear to God-</i>
- <i>It's true.</i>

407
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:20,503
- What? What's wrong?
- Nothing, honey. Nothing's wrong.

408
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:24,564
So if you eat a lot of ice cream,
you might become fat.

409
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:28,510
And if you don't, you're gonna
stay nice and skinny, sweetie.

410
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:31,605
- Mom-
- Olive, Richard is an idiot.

411
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:33,980
I like a woman
with meat on her bones.

412
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:36,053
<i>[Olive]</i>
<i>I don't- Why's everyone so upset?</i>

413
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,554
<i>No, no one's upset, honey. L-</i>

414
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,716
I just want you to understand...

415
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:44,955
it's okay to be skinny, and it's okay
to be fat, if that's what you want to be.

416
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:47,327
Whatever you want, it's okay.

417
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:50,333
<i>Okay, but, Olive,</i>
<i>let me ask you this.</i>

418
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:53,233
Those women in Miss America-

419
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:57,638
Are they skinny,
or are they fat?

420
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:01,537
<i>Honey?</i>

421
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:05,377
<i>Well, they're skinny, I guess.</i>

422
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:08,247
<i>Yeah. I guess they don't</i>
<i>eat a lot of ice cream.</i>

423
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:12,722
<i>Okay. Coffee. Coffee.</i>

424
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:16,188
- Grapefruit.
- Thank you.

425
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:20,355
Chamomile.
And here's your ice cream.

426
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:24,026
"Alamodey," right? I'll be back
with your waffles in a second.

427
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,533
Does anyone want my ice cream?

428
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:33,008
<i>Yeah, I'd like a little.</i>
<i>Dwayne? Frank?</i>

429
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:36,342
- Olive's not gonna have her ice cream.
- Do you mind if I have a little?

430
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:38,712
- Yeah, let's dig in.
- That looks really good.

431
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:41,285
<i>[Grandpa]</i>
<i>Boy, I feel sorry for anybody...</i>

432
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:44,048
that doesn't want to enjoy their ice cream
so early in the morning.

433
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:46,851
- <i>Boy, that looks good.</i>
- <i>You sure you don't wanna have some, Olive?</i>

434
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:49,085
<i>Those waffles are gonna be</i>
<i>awful lonely in there.</i>

435
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:51,754
- Mmm! Mmm!
- Watch this.

436
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:55,094
Wait! Stop!
Don't eat it all.

437
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:02,402

<i>How long till we get there?</i>

444
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,026
- A long time, honey.
- I know. But how long?

445
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:34,162
Well, we gotta do 600 miles of driving
today and 200 tomorrow.

- That's a lot of driving. Let's go.
- I'll drive for a while.

447
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,906
- No, no. I got it.
- No. I gotta learn how to do this.

- Okay. Okay, there you go.

452
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,182
Now push the clutch in

453
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:57,660
It's on the floor.

You know these- these old buses?

You don't need the clutch to change from-
from the third to the fourth.

<i>15, 20 miles per hour...</i>
