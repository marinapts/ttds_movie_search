I'm Chief Inspector Walter Uhl
and I'm inspecting your theater.

179

Very impressive.

<i>- Yes!</i>

Yes, the orange tree.

- Extraordinary.
- Thank you.

190

over how it works...

191
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:23,278

Are you a gambling man?

you place this in every time.

- A lucky guess, perhaps.

209

You have a confederate
who signals you.

210

- No. It's more primitive than that.
- Uh-huh.

211

When you raise your hand to your head,
the blood drains from it.

Except of course for your assistant,

00:34:42,177 --> 00:34:44,168
that may not seem friendly...

344
00:34:44,246 --> 00:34:47,807
but I assure you, in fact, is.
[Clears Throat]

345
00:34:49,718 --> 00:34:53,882
What is your relationship
with the Duchess von Teschen?

346
00:34:53,955 --> 00:34:56,685
You're right,
that doesn't seem friendly.

347
00:34:56,758 --> 00:34:59,226
Oh, but that is precisely my point.

348
00:34:59,294 --> 00:35:02,991
For, you see,
where others might judge...

349
00:35:03,064 --> 00:35:07,865
a discreet carriage ride
for what it seemed to be...

350
00:35:07,936 --> 00:35:11,531
I am willing to find out
what it actually was.

351
00:35:13,275 --> 00:35:16,005
All right. We were
childhood acquaintances.

352
00:35:16,077 --> 00:35:18,477
Acquaintances?

353
00:35:18,547 --> 00:35:20,845
Childhood friends.

354
00:35:20,916 --> 00:35:23,077
My father was a cabinetmaker.

355
00:35:23,151 --> 00:35:26,780
<i>- He made the furniture for her family's house.</i>
- [Chuckles]

356
00:35:26,855 --> 00:35:30,188
I see, the cabinetmaker's son
friends with a-

357
00:35:30,258 --> 00:35:35,161
- Has there been a complaint?
- Oh, no, no. If there'd been a complaint...

358
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:38,722
well, we'd be having a very, uh,
different sort of conversation.

359
00:35:40,101 --> 00:35:44,731
Yes. He relies on you for
that sort of thing, does he?

360
00:35:44,806 --> 00:35:47,741
I'm a simple public servant,
Herr Eisenheim.

361
00:35:47,809 --> 00:35:49,868
That's not what I hear.

362
00:35:49,945 --> 00:35:53,608
I hear you'll be
the chief of police very soon.

363
00:35:53,682 --> 00:35:58,210
- Maybe mayor of Vienna? Party secretary?
- All subject to his whim.

364
00:35:58,286 --> 00:36:01,346
You better hope he doesn't dissolve
the parliament before you get there.

365
00:36:01,423 --> 00:36:05,883
Now the prince has some progressive ideas,
but he will make a fine emperor.

366
00:36:05,961 --> 00:36:09,727
Well, they say you're very close to him,
so I'm sure you'll do fine.

367
00:36:09,798 --> 00:36:15,600
Look. Yes, indeed, they say
that I'm very close to the prince.

368
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:20,801
But the simple truth of the matter is,
Herr Eisenheim, I'm the son of a butcher.

369
00:36:20,876 --> 00:36:24,937
He's the heir to the empire.
How close could we be to such as him?

370
00:36:25,013 --> 00:36:28,779
<i>Hmm? Do you see my point?</i>

371
00:36:33,154 --> 00:36:36,385
Don't fool yourself that
you can play in their game.

372
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,194
I've served on the edge of it...

373
00:36:40,262 --> 00:36:44,255
for... many, many years...

374
00:36:44,332 --> 00:36:46,425
and I can tell you with certainty...

375
00:36:46,501 --> 00:36:49,800
<i>there's no trick they haven't seen.</i>

376
00:36:53,441 --> 00:36:56,342
It's not worth it.

377
00:37:00,515 --> 00:37:03,177
<i>My guest tonight...</i>

378
00:37:03,251 --> 00:37:08,484
is not a showman at all,
but rather a wizard...

379
00:37:08,556 --> 00:37:12,083
<i>who has sold his soul</i>
<i>to the devil...</i>

380
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,596
<i>in return for unholy powers.</i>

381
00:37:15,664 --> 00:37:18,633
Or so at least some of our friends here
would have us believe.

382
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,134
- [All Laughing]
<i>- But fear not.</i>

383
00:37:21,202 --> 00:37:26,401
Everything can
and will be explained.

384
00:37:26,474 --> 00:37:31,002
- All mysteries penetrated.
<i>- [Man] Hear! Hear!</i>

<i>- [Man #2] Ah, yes, your father.</i>

388
00:38:02,577 --> 00:38:05,876

389

<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Bravo.</i>

390
00:38:16,157 --> 00:38:19,558
A fair likeness of the old man.

391
00:38:19,627 --> 00:38:22,994
- Too modern a style for him, of course.
<i>- [Laughter]</i>

392
00:38:23,064 --> 00:38:25,191
I'm afraid I'm not much
of a painter.

393
00:38:25,266 --> 00:38:28,531
It's true. There are no brushstrokes
in this painting.

394
00:38:28,603 --> 00:38:32,004
I can see that clearly.

395
00:38:32,073 --> 00:38:34,007
So to achieve the color...

396
00:38:34,075 --> 00:38:37,909
some sort of chemical must
be interacting, presumably.

397
00:38:37,979 --> 00:38:40,880
<i>Some sort of sprayer up your sleeve?</i>

- If you feel you must.

399
00:38:45,887 --> 00:38:49,584
- I do.
- Oh, let the man do his show.

400
00:38:49,657 --> 00:38:52,717
You want me to just sit there
when it's so obvious?

401
00:38:52,794 --> 00:38:55,126
- [Laughter]
- I do.

402
00:38:55,196 --> 00:38:57,858
He tries to trick you.
I try to enlighten you.

Which is the more noble pursuit?

404
00:39:00,335 --> 00:39:02,269
May we have the lights, please...

405
00:39:02,337 --> 00:39:04,635
so His Highness can better see?

406
00:39:04,706 --> 00:39:08,437
- [Man] See here, Leopold, let's have the show.
- [Man #2] Hear! Hear!

407
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:10,876
- Come on, Leopold.
- Get on with it.

408
00:39:10,945 --> 00:39:13,778
[Leopold]
Very well. I propose a challenge.

409

412
00:39:25,727 --> 00:39:28,287
As you wish.

<i>Your sword is very beautiful.</i>

415
00:39:34,369 --> 00:39:36,360
Certainly.

00:39:39,007 --> 00:39:40,998
May I?

417
00:39:47,348 --> 00:39:49,976
Where does power flow from?

418
00:39:51,986 --> 00:39:55,683
Skill or destiny, or divine right?

419
00:39:57,859 --> 00:40:01,659
We all know the story
of a sword called Excalibur.

420
00:40:03,131 --> 00:40:06,862
Excalibur's blade
was fixed in stone...

421
00:40:10,472 --> 00:40:13,032
and there it stayed.

[Crowd Murmuring]

423
00:40:15,176 --> 00:40:19,772
Many worthy knights tried to
pull the sword from the stone.

424
00:40:19,848 --> 00:40:22,612
Only Arthur succeeded...

425
00:40:22,684 --> 00:40:24,652

478
00:46:25,647 --> 00:46:28,616

01:23:45,383 --> 01:23:48,375
but if your manifestations
are somehow real...

843
01:23:48,453 --> 01:23:51,479
then even I'm willing to admit,
you're a very special person.

844
01:23:51,556 --> 01:23:54,491
And if it's a trick,
then it's equally impressive.

845
01:23:54,559 --> 01:23:57,084
Either way, you have a gift.

846
01:23:57,161 --> 01:24:00,528
So don't make me put you in jail!

847
01:24:00,598 --> 01:24:02,828
Promise me you won't do it again.

848
01:24:02,901 --> 01:24:06,166
I promise you, you'll
enjoy this next show.

849
01:24:07,272 --> 01:24:10,173
[Sighs]
What do you want?

850
01:24:10,241 --> 01:24:14,610
- Nothing.
- Then why bring her back?

851
01:24:16,581 --> 01:24:18,572
Just to be with her.

852
01:24:21,352 --> 01:24:23,286
To be with her.

853
01:24:33,097 --> 01:24:35,031
- Everything is ready?
- Yes, sir.

854
01:24:35,099 --> 01:24:38,296
- We're trying to assess how he might escape.
- He will not escape.

855
01:24:38,369 --> 01:24:40,929
- I want guards at every door and window!
- Sir.

856
01:24:48,613 --> 01:24:51,283
<i>I want to apologize to you</i>
<i>for my behavior oflate.</i>

857
01:24:51,416 --> 01:24:54,317
But I want to make it up to you,
if you'll listen to a proposition.

858
01:24:54,386 --> 01:24:57,651
- Well, I don't know.
- I'll make it worth your while, Josef.

859
01:24:57,722 --> 01:25:01,021
You know, I'm very busy right now. I haven't
just been sitting around waiting for you.

860
01:25:01,092 --> 01:25:03,083
No. No, of course.

861
01:25:07,532 --> 01:25:11,059
I want you to assume control
of all my finances.

862
01:25:11,136 --> 01:25:13,570
And my assets.

863
01:25:13,638 --> 01:25:16,266
- Everything.
- Everything?

864
01:25:16,341 --> 01:25:19,504
Yes. Including this theater...

865
01:25:19,577 --> 01:25:21,511
and all the receipts from
tonight's performance...

866
01:25:21,579 --> 01:25:24,514
which I offer with
my sincere thanks.

867
01:25:28,019 --> 01:25:32,388
- What do you say?
- All right.

868
01:25:32,457 --> 01:25:35,483
- I'll do it.
- Good. Good.

869
01:25:36,661 --> 01:25:39,789
Would you like me
to introduce you tonight?

870
01:25:39,864 --> 01:25:42,697
No. Tonight, just enjoy the show.

872
01:26:05,156 --> 01:26:08,455
Excuse me, Chief Inspector.
I'm Josef Fischer, Eisenheim's manager.

873
01:26:08,526 --> 01:26:10,892
Yes, I remember.

874
01:26:10,962 --> 01:26:13,829
- What's going on? Why all the police?
- Precautions, Herr Fischer.

875
01:26:13,898 --> 01:26:16,594
- Precautions.
- Are you planning to arrest Eisenheim?

876
01:26:16,668 --> 01:26:19,603
Oh, that's entirely up to him.

<i>I have no doubt that it will.</i>

And after that, I came in here...

915
01:34:07,505 --> 01:34:10,702
and you asked me why I was late.

916
01:34:11,776 --> 01:34:13,744
You've stolen Imperial property.

917
01:34:13,811 --> 01:34:16,041
That seems trivial
compared with murder.

918
01:34:16,113 --> 01:34:18,513
Even if that were true, you have
no jurisdiction here.

919
01:34:18,583 --> 01:34:23,020
<i>That's right. You may do as you wish here,</i>
<i>without consequence.</i>

920
01:34:24,222 --> 01:34:27,953
Nobody can punish you.

921
01:34:28,025 --> 01:34:30,118
- Except one man.
- Who's that?

922
01:34:30,194 --> 01:34:33,061
The emperor.

923
01:34:33,130 --> 01:34:36,099
I don't suppose he'll leave his crown
to a murderer, do you?

924
01:34:39,237 --> 01:34:42,570
- He'll never believe you.
- Maybe not.

925
01:34:43,875 --> 01:34:46,673
Hmm.

926
01:34:46,744 --> 01:34:48,871
But, I wrote a letter
to his general staff...

927
01:34:48,946 --> 01:34:52,313
<i>telling them... everything.</i>

928
01:34:52,383 --> 01:34:55,648
<i>Including your plan</i>
<i>to overthrow the emperor.</i>

01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:58,917

<i>You'll not take the throne-</i>
<i>not with my help.</i>

Mayor of Vienna?

01:35:06,230 --> 01:35:09,859
<i>You don't want to be</i>
<i>a baron, an aristocrat?</i>

933
01:35:11,168 --> 01:35:13,932
I'm afraid that's out of
the question at this point.

934
01:35:19,377 --> 01:35:21,311
You fool.
He's tricking you.

935
01:35:21,379 --> 01:35:24,871
He's manipulating you. He had the sword
at a command performance.

936
01:35:24,949 --> 01:35:27,440
He could have pried the stones loose then
and planted them here.

937
01:35:27,518 --> 01:35:29,452
- He has planted everything.
- You're drunk.

938
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:34,184
It's all a trick.
It's an illusion.

939
01:35:35,660 --> 01:35:38,925
Perhaps there's truth
in this illusion.

940
01:35:52,009 --> 01:35:54,307
You need to wire your driver,
and have the sword returned.

941
01:35:54,378 --> 01:35:58,212
- Or what?
- I'll shoot you. Perhaps I'll shoot you anyway.

942
01:35:58,282 --> 01:36:01,774
And then you'll have killed
a police inspector and a duchess.

943
01:36:01,852 --> 01:36:03,786
Or perhaps you'll kill yourself.

944
01:36:03,854 --> 01:36:07,517
You, uh, committed suicide,
distraught at having failed your leader.

<i>of the general staff, I'd guess.</i>

947
01:36:29,213 --> 01:36:31,204
