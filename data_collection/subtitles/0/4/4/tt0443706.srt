1
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,233
Where have you been?
I've been waiting since 7.

2
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,819
Get in. I have to find fireworks.

3
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:15,616
- Let me drive.
- Get in. I haven't eaten in 24 hours.

4
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,661
Are you coming or not?

5
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,970
- all next week at Ganzori Diamonds
at 1017 Fourth Street, San Rafael.

6
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:39,431
Open till 9 Friday.

7
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,642
It's too crowded.

8
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:44,019
I thought you were starving.

9
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,023
Let's go someplace quiet.

10
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,943
Okay.

11
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,539
What are we doing?

12
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:10,379
Sitting. Listening to music. Talking.

13
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,714
You seem weird. Is everything okay?

14
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:14,925
Yeah, everything's fine.

15
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,935
It's July.
How many shirts are you wearing?

16
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:28,272
- I'm cold.
- You're cold on the Fourth of July?

17
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:35,154
Fuck off and die!

18
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,327
What?

19
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,204
"Fuck off and die"?

20
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,457
Shut up.

21
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,776
Was that car at the drive-in?

22
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,740
I saw that car at Mr. Ed's.

23
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,124
- Do you want me to tell him to leave?
- Stay in the car.

24
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,975
- Was that your husband?
- No.

25
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,813
Who was that, Darlene?

26
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,234
Don't worry about it.

27
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,236
Don't tell me not to worry. Who was it?

28
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,029
It's nothing.

29
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,759
Oh, shit.

30
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,222
Let's go.

31
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,893
Now, D.

32
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,490
Get your wallet.

33
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,750
Man, you really creeped us out.

34
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,316
- Vallejo Police Department.
- I wanna report a double murder.

35
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:02,235
- May I have your name and...?
- lf you go one mile east...

36
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:06,990
...on Columbus Parkway to the public
park, you'll find kids in a brown car.

37
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:11,286
They were shot with a 9 mm Luger.

38
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,289
I also killed those kids last year.

39
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,167
Goodbye.

40
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,478
Spit.

41
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,397
Come on, buddy.

42
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,023
I swallowed it.

43
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,483
Why?

44
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,652
It was minty.

45
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,071
You can't do that. It's not good for you.

46
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,365
Lunchbox.

47
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:52,160
- Why am I not going on the bus?
- Because we're late.

48
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,332
Okay, you're staying with your mom
and Aaron tonight.

49
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,168
So you don't like
having a new little brother?

50
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,295
No, not really.

51
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,297
That's honest.

52
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,175
Learn a lot.

53
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,181
There will be a test tonight.

54
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,393
With Gerrard turntable
and Pioneer speakers for $188.

55
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,311
Make it to Manny's before 10
but hurry.

56
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,689
64 Renovation Street,
top of the hill at 86th.

57
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,384
Morning.

58
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,012
- Fine, how are you this morning?
- Morning.

59
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,513
- Morning.
- Morning.

60
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,724
Take it easy.

61
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,485
Reminds you the deadline
to submit applications for...

62
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,279
...the 15th annual
Junior Rock competition.

63
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:13,658
Applications are available at libraries
and schools throughout the Bay Area.

64
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,244
How's the coffee today, Shorty?

65
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,292
Editorial in two.

66
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,992
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning.

67
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:42,122
Oh, Stanton, tell Mr. Howe the
draft-board piece was damn near perfect.

68
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,374
Mr. Graysmith.

69
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,253
Horrid. Horrid.

70
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,505
Not so horrid.

71
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:53,717
Horrid.
I'm thinking we go with "not so horrid."

72
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,888
Paul, what's on the crime beat?

73
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:03,018
Janice in Datebook left the fondue party
before everyone got naked.

74
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,936
That's a crime.

75
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,063
Have you seen her? Wouldn't kid you.

76
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,691
It may be the beginning of a crime wave.

77
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,611
You need to see this.

78
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,409
Go get the publisher.

79
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:36,468
Christmas. Brand name of ammo:
Super-X.

80
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,219
Ten shots were fired.

81
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,889
The boy was on his back
with his feet to the car.

82
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,724
The girl..."

83
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,687
Would you read that, please?

84
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,650
"The girl was on her right side,
feet to the west.

85
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:56,237
Fourth of July.
One, girl was wearing patterned slacks.

86
00:10:56,405 --> 00:11:01,326
The boy was also shot in the knee.
Brand name of ammo was Western.

87
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,078
Here is part of a cipher.

88
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,330
The other two parts of this cipher...

89
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:09,751
...are being mailed to the editors
of the Vallejo Times and S.F. Examiner.

90
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,588
I want you to print this cipher
on the front page of your paper.

91
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,257
In this cipher is my 'idenity.'

92
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:19,135
If you do not print this cipher
by the afternoon of Fri... '"

93
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:24,933
F-R-Y. "...1 st of Aug. '69,
I will go on a kill rampage Fri. night.

94
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:29,145
I will cruise around all weekend
killing lone people in the night...

95
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:34,609
...then move on to kill again until I end up
with a dozen people over the weekend."

96
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,736
It's unsigned except for a symbol.

97
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:42,367
Is it me,
or does that look like a gunsight?

98
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,621
Today's August 1 st. He wants
his code in the afternoon edition.

99
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:50,125
If the Examiner doesn't have the balls
to run it, we scoop the Bay.

100
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:53,545
- This is about shooting people.
- Not running this might make him.

101
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,381
If we run it, we might be setting
a dangerous precedent.

102
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,632
It's newsworthy.

103
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,553
We're giving some sick bastard a
soapbox. What does that say to people?

104
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,222
Back up. Is this Vallejo story true?
Do we know that?

105
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,143
- Paul?
- What? I cover crime in Vallejo?

106
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:13,231
- I cover crime in Vallejo. Ten minutes.
- Let's shoot the code and call S.F.P.D.

107
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,776
If it turns out to be real,
at least we'll have the material.

108
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,778
All right.

109
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,948
Graysmith, don't you have
that cartoon to finish?

110
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,366
Oh, yeah.

111
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,041
This is Paul Avery
from the San Francisco Chronicle.

112
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:35,503
I'm looking for someone to shed
some light on a letter we received.

113
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,047
- Thank you.
- Sergeant Mulanax.

114
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:40,884
Sergeant, Paul Avery
from the San Francisco Chronicle.

115
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:44,471
I wanted to check if you had an unsolved
firearm homicide on Christmas...

116
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,514
...and maybe one on July 4th?

117
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,768
Shit. You guys got one too?

118
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:53,646
Confirmed.
V.P.D., they confirmed the shootings.

119
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:56,816
Al's on the phone with the Examiner.
They got a different code.

120
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,819
So did Times-Herald. Christmas,
two teenagers on lovers' lane.

121
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,905
Both DOA.
David Faraday and Betty Jensen.

122
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:05,533
July 4th, Darlene Ferrin and
Michael Mag... I think it's '"Mayhew.'"

123
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:08,036
- Anyway, he lived, she didn't.
- The murder weapon?

124
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,705
Ballistics, everything he said
in the letters match.

125
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,666
I mean, I think the Times-Herald's
gonna go with it.

126
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,795
The Examiner's going,
but won't go front page.

127
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,296
I say let's go front page.

128
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,216
If he kills 12 people, it's not our fault.

129
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,884
Robert.

130
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,969
We need the cartoon.

131
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:29,432
- You're not finished?
- No, I'm finished, Carol. I'm finished.

132
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,226
Thieriot's still here.

133
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,852
Really?

134
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:36,397
The first edition is off the floor in 10,
Charles.

135
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,236
Give us a sec.

136
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,448
Okay, re-plate.

137
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:49,536
We'll go on page... Page 4.

138
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:53,581
What do you say, 20 bucks
to whoever cracks the psycho's name?

139
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,708
He won't give his name.

140
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,711
Morti's? Anyone?

141
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,047
- That's where I'm heading.
- All right.

142
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,451
Put those on my desk.
Turn on the light.

143
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,089
Grab your book.

144
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,969
Now go get your jammies on.

145
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,098
All right, people, listen up.

146
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,392
The cipher's broken into three sections...

147
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,812
...each with 8 lines and 17 symbols.

148
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,772
No breaks denoting different words.

149
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,067
No numbers or clues
to substitution keys.

150
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,154
And you got symbols
from at least seven different sources.

151
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:11,117
Greek, Morse code, Navy semaphore,
weather symbols, astrological signs.

152
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:20,585
- Hey, take a gander at this code thing.
- Okay.

153
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,258
You wanna give it a go?

154
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,221
Guy who used to sit there
was a great cartoonist. Bob Bastian.

155
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:36,225
Now he's on public television
for some reason.

156
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,686
Paul Avery.

157
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,732
Robert Graysmith.
I've been here nine months.

158
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,112
You were right, by the way.
He didn't give his name.

159
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,366
- Who cracked it?
- A history teacher and his wife in Salinas.

160
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:54,702
"I like killing people
because it is so much fun.

161
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,539
It is more fun than killing wild game
in the forest...

162
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:02,794
...because man is the most dangerous
animal of all.

163
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,130
To kill something gives me
the most thrilling experience.

164
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:10,218
It is even better than
getting your rocks off with a girl.

165
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:14,055
The best part of it is that when I die...

166
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:17,517
...I will be reborn in paradise...

167
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:20,561
...and all that I have killed
will become my slaves.

168
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:24,273
I will not give you my name,
because you will try to slow down...

169
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:27,694
...or stop my collecting
of slaves for my afterlife."'

170
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,405
Methinks our friend's
a tad bit "fuckered" in the head.

171
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:33,866
I heard he even sent Vallejo a code key,
just to help.

172
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,119
- What is that at the bottom?
- Leftovers.

173
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,704
Maybe an anagram.

174
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:57,724
How does one do that?

175
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,642
I like puzzles. I do them a lot.

176
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:04,188
How did you know
he wasn't gonna give his name?

177
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,066
"Dangerous animal."

178
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,444
Dangerous animal.

179
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,197
What dangerous animal?
How do I know that?

180
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,956
- Paul.
- Yes, Templeton?

181
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,417
- Editorial, now.
- Very well.

182
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,754
Another letter.

183
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,547
More of the same.

184
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,674
Details about the murders.

185
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:36,137
He taped a flashlight to the gun.
That's how he hit them in the dark.

186
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,431
And he gave himself a name.

187
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,454
You know this used to be
the town of Monticello?

188
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,541
But at some point,
the county decided that the land...

189
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:09,337
...would work better as a lake
so they flooded it.

190
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:14,342
- But there's an entire...
- Hidden city under the water.

191
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,637
- We were here last spring, remember?
- Oh, yeah.

192
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:27,563
- Somebody else is here.
- It is a public park.

193
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,527
I think he's watching us.

194
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,862
Well, we're very good-looking.

195
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,537
Where'd he go?

196
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:49,085
- He went behind that tree.
- All right, so he's taking a leak.

197
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,094
He's coming towards us.

198
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,556
Oh, my God, he has a gun.

199
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,267
Don't move.

200
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:07,353
- I want your money and your car keys.
- Okay.

201
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,438
We're not gonna do anything, okay?

202
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:12,733
We're gonna cooperate.
Just tell me what you want us to do.

203
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,406
Here.

204
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,785
You're welcome to everything I have.

205
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,916
If there's anything else
I could do for you...?

206
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:31,085
Maybe I could write you a check?

207
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,923
Okay, I could give you
my phone number.

208
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,302
You know, I might be able to help you...

209
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:44,265
...even more than you might think.
- He's a sociology major.

210
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:49,103
Prelaw, actually.

211
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:53,983
Oh, keys. You know, I'm sorry. I don't
know exactly where I put my keys.

212
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:57,069
They might be on the blanket.
Is it okay...?

213
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,367
Here's the keys.

214
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:08,497
Don't get up. I want her to tie you up.

215
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,503
Okay.

216
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:36,984
You know, if he comes any closer
I might be able to get that gun.

217
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,237
- Don't get any ideas.
- I'm not.

218
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,989
I killed a guard
escaping from prison in Montana.

219
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,991
I'm not doing anything, okay?

220
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,993
I'm not afraid to kill again.

221
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,580
Look away.

222
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,381
What was the name of that prison?

223
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,054
Hey, you said it was in Montana, right?

224
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:10,017
I'm taking your car
and going to Mexico.

225
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,228
We didn't complain
when you tied our hands.

226
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,146
Okay, you have everything that I have.

227
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,357
We have done everything
that you've asked.

228
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,442
It's okay. It's okay.

229
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,028
She tied you loose, didn't she?

230
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,284
Get on your stomach
so I can tie your feet.

231
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:30,913
Okay. It gets really cold out here
at night. We could freeze.

232
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,381
Okay, you all done?

233
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:46,637
You know, just because people are
gonna ask, was that thing even loaded?

234
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:00,276
It's okay. This is all gonna be okay.

235
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,934
Dispatch, this is 43L2,
heading south on Knoxville Road.

236
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,604
I've got an abandoned white
VW Karmann Ghia.

237
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,954
Napa Police Department.

238
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:59,251
I want to report a murder.
No, a double murder.

239
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:03,255
They are two miles
north of park headquarters.

240
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:07,510
They were in a white
Volkswagen Karmann Ghia.

241
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,429
I'm the one that did it.

242
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:15,309
43L2 has a male victim with him.
Piner's ambulance has been dispatched.

243
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:18,437
Boy lived, the girl didn't. Again.

244
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:22,191
Can you imagine surviving that?
Writing the dates on the side of the car.

245
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:25,820
We got two Vallejo killings,
now there's one in Napa. Why Napa?

246
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:29,156
What the hell is he doing out of Vallejo?
Sweet mother of Christ...

247
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,158
...what are you drawing?

248
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:34,412
Kid at the lake? This is what he said
the Zodiac was wearing.

249
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,164
- My God, that's a hell of a getup.
- What are you doing?

250
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:40,292
Hyman, I wrote it. It's done.
Now I just gotta type it up.

251
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,546
It's not finished until you type it up.
We've gotta read it.

252
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,218
- What's that?
- That's the Zodiac at the lake.

253
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:53,389
What's the story with the kid? He seems
a little touched or medicated or...

254
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,850
- Graysmith? He's a fucking Boy Scout.
- Yeah.

255
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:58,686
He doesn't smoke, he doesn't drink,
he doesn't curse.

256
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,689
- And he's back.
- "Man is the most dangerous animal."

257
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:05,109
I knew that I heard that from
somewhere. The Most Dangerous Game.

258
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,987
It's a movie about a count
who hunts people for sport.

259
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,781
People. The Most Dangerous Game.

260
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,660
- Who's that? That's the...?
- That's Count Zaroff.

261
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,830
Zaroff? With a Z?

262
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,083
That will be all for the news.

263
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,752
We've got curfews tonight
for the following counties:

264
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,797
Napa, Solano, Contra Costa,
Alameda, Marin, and San Mateo...

265
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,009
...so please, everyone, stay safe.

266
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:33,721
Vic in San Francisco, you're on the line.
You're not scared of the Zodiac?

267
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,557
Heck, no,
he's only shooting those farm kids.

268
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,226
What scares me is those hippies
out in the Haight...

269
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,395
...with their free love and weird clothes.

270
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,481
- Taxi.
- We've got Alfred from Vacaville.

271
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:47,526
You know, I think that was
really offensive. It's not just farm kids.

272
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,278
These are nice clean-cut people.

273
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:52,031
Hey, nobody's downplaying
the loss of human life here.

274
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,074
Well, that last guy was.

275
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:57,119
We have good solid communities
out here in the North Bay...

276
00:24:57,287 --> 00:25:00,873
...unlike in the city where you
have Satanists running around.

277
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:04,084
Well, you bring up a good question.
Is the Zodiac a Satanist?

278
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:06,212
Amber from Oakland, what do you think?

279
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:10,090
I don't know, but I thought that code
they printed didn't look very Christian.

280
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:12,301
I think a bigger problem is the papers...

281
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:15,221
...shouldn't have printed anything
Zodiac has been doing.

282
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:18,390
That they're printing all that stuff
to sell more newspapers.

283
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,436
Well, the Zodiac did demand they print
his letters or he'd kill more people.

284
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,689
But he would have done it anyway,
whether they printed it or not.

285
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:29,193
An interesting point.
So, what do you think he'll do next?

286
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:53,259
- San Francisco Police Department.
- There's a fight in a cab!

287
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:54,593
What is your location?

288
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:57,721
3398 Washington,
at the corner of Cherry.

289
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,890
One's drunk
and we think he's robbing him.

290
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:03,519
- Is the crime still in progress?
- Yes, please hurry.

291
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,522
Oh, my God, look!

292
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,754
Nuts!

293
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,384
Whoever this is,
you owe me a new lamp.

294
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:38,137
Cabby's been shot
three blocks from the Presidio.

295
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:41,223
It wasn't me. I been with my bride
all night, she can vouch.

296
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,475
Go put on the Folgers.

297
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:45,019
You'll pick me up?

298
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:47,730
Let me just describe the lamp
you're gonna buy me.

299
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,866
- I just got to sleep.
- Suspect's Negro, male adult.

300
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,452
Walt's on scene, locked the cab,
secured the crowd.

301
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,330
Dead asleep.
I lost feeling in my arm and everything.

302
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:06,081
Crackers?

303
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:11,420
You ever try Japanese food?

304
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:14,256
- What do you mean, like teriyaki?
- No, like the urchin.

305
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,967
- Raw fish?
- I'm eating here, Bill.

306
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:21,180
- I always wanted to try it.
- So why don't you?

307
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,890
Haven't got around to it.

308
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,992
Evening, gents. What a lovely night
for a botched robbery.

309
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,662
Yeah, third this week.
Must be end-of-summer rush.

310
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,998
I got foot patrols going through the park,
the dogs are on the way.

311
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:52,252
The victim's name is Paul Stine.
Dousette pronounced him at 10:10.

312
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:56,423
Suspect fired one shot to the head.
Driver's wallet and car keys are missing.

313
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,592
- How'd you know his name?
- Leroy there...

314
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,594
...came down from Yellow Cab
to ID him.

315
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:04,598
Neighborhood's pretty high-end for this,
so I already set up transpo for the cab.

316
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,308
- Coroner's here.
- Any witnesses?

317
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:09,478
Kids who called it in
saw the suspect from that window.

318
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,438
- They hear a shot?
- No.

319
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:14,441
They saw him in the front seat,
thought he was a drunk.

320
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:17,403
Oldest kid ran to get a better look
from the dining room...

321
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,571
...described him as a white male,
glasses...

322
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:21,865
...crew cut, stocky,
and wearing a dark jacket.

323
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:25,786
- I thought someone said he was black.
- The description went out to radio cars.

324
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,622
- We already corrected it.
- Oh, well, that's good.

325
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,250
- You guys need anything else?
- No. Get out of here.

326
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,127
Thanks. Happy birthday.

327
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:35,295
Wait, it's your birthday?

328
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,131
- Yep.
- That's great. Happy birthday.

329
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:41,135
- Thanks. Body or scene?
- It's your birthday, I'll take the body.

330
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:45,431
Dave, he wiped the cab down pretty
good. We got some blood over here.

331
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,933
- Prints?
- Could be. We'll dust it at the Hall.

332
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:50,769
The odd thing is, we also got gloves.

333
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:54,022
- Suspect's?
- There's blood on them.

334
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:57,401
Hey, Pete? You through
over there, can I get in there?

335
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,153
Yeah, I'm all set.

336
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,489
- Who rolled him?
- Stewarts.

337
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:11,832
I got a single 9 mm casing.

338
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,421
Yeah, Luger.

339
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,715
Nothing from the crowd.

340
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,301
I'm your shooter, Negro male adult...

341
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:25,345
...who also happens to be a stocky,
crew-cut Caucasian.

342
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,973
I flag a cab. I give him this address.

343
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:31,059
Did I give him this address?
Who's got the fare book?

344
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:32,478
Right here.

345
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:38,942
Washington and Maple.
That's one block east.

346
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:02,466
Lighting's the same over here, so maybe
I see someone walking their dog.

347
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:06,720
You don't want any witnesses, so you
tell him to go down a block. Pulls over.

348
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,889
I wait for him to park
because I'm smart.

349
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,558
I don't want him hitting the accelerator
when I shoot.

350
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,936
He stops, puts it in park:

351
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:16,438
I shoot him on the right side,
he slumps right?

352
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:19,191
Maybe you've got your hand
on his collar when you shoot.

353
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:22,069
So I just dumped a quart of blood
in the front seat.

354
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:25,113
- So why do you get in the front seat?
- For the money.

355
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:28,283
But you could just reach over the seat,
pull out his wallet.

356
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:30,953
You don't have to go
anywhere near the blood.

357
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,955
So why'd he get in the front seat?

358
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,207
- I'm an idiot.
- But you're not.

359
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,125
You waited for him to put it in park.

360
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,586
- Right. Thank you.
- Yeah, sure.

361
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,382
- May I see that?
- Yeah.

362
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,677
I am an idiot.
I just killed a man for $8.25.

363
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:51,223
It's his third fare of the night.
Does anyone have any Animal Crackers?

364
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:54,101
- Animal Crackers?
- They're in the car.

365
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,228
I'm saving those for later.

366
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,063
Fine.

367
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:05,612
- Are you a reporter?
- No, I'm Inspector Dave Toschi, S.F.P.D.

368
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:09,491
Sir, I was wondering if I'd be able
to talk to your children one at a time...

369
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,411
...and preferably alone?
- They just saw a man murdered.

370
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,413
I understand.

371
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:17,457
- It looked like they were drunk.
- Yeah, and he had a rag.

372
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,960
He came around the car.
He was wiping stuff.

373
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,962
Did you get a chance to see his face?

374
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:25,382
I did. Well, sort of.

375
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,886
Do you remember what he looked like?

376
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:31,805
Normal.

377
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,891
- Yeah.
- Normal?

378
00:31:56,664 --> 00:32:00,375
"This is the Zodiac speaking.
I am the murderer of the taxi driver...

379
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:03,962
...over by Washington Street
and Maple Street last night.

380
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,965
To prove this,
here is a bloodstained piece of his shirt.

381
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:11,720
I am the same man who did in the people
in the North Bay Area.

382
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:16,266
The police could've caught me last night
if they had searched the park properly...

383
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:19,353
...instead of holding road races
with their 'motorsickles.'"'

384
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,979
- Gentlemen.
- Dave.

385
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,440
Paul, where's the shirt?

386
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:26,109
Right there, boss.

387
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,906
- Your rag the kids talked about.
- So he got in the seat to tear off a piece.

388
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,367
- Is this on the record?
- Well, what do you think?

389
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,702
He confirms
the Vallejo and Napa killings.

390
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,455
- Gets worse.
- Robert, do you have a deadline?

391
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,333
What does he mean, "it gets worse"?

392
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:43,043
Read the last part.

393
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,462
"School children make nice targets.

394
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,756
I think I shall wipe out
a bus some morning.

395
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,424
Just shoot out the front tire...

396
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:52,219
...then pick off the kiddies
as they come bouncing out."

397
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,554
Who's got buses,
Department of Transportation?

398
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:56,598
- School board.
- All right.

399
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:59,101
I'm gonna need elimination prints
from your staff.

400
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:01,895
Is anyone here
that didn't touch this letter?

401
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,402
Going back to my desk.
I can get the phones if you want.

402
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,362
We need matches on blood and fabric.

403
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,323
I'll call and get the letters up
to Sherwood in Sacramento.

404
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:16,743
Dave, just one thing.
Is it true they got a print off the cab?

405
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:19,579
Yeah, we got a partial in blood.

406
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,624
- But that is not for publication.
- No, hey, come on.

407
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,585
Hey, it's me.

408
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,587
Did he say they got a print?

409
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:30,298
Partial.

410
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:37,556
- He wears his gun like Bullitt.
- No, McQueen got that from Toschi.

411
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:41,184
He think Zodiac's gonna send another
code? I think Zodiac's gonna send...

412
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:44,312
Jesus Harold Christ on rubber crutches.
What are you doing?

413
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,649
You're doing that thing we discussed.
The thing that I don't like.

414
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,276
- Starts with an L.
- Oh, looming.

415
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,485
Yeah.

416
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,446
In cooperation with S.F.P. D...

417
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:56,199
...we will run the Zodiac letter
without including the threat on children.

418
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,285
We don't wanna start
a city-wide panic...

419
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,496
...so I'm asking all of you
to please keep this confidential.

420
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:05,751
Just go about your daily business.
Thank you.

421
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:24,144
Packed you your carrots and your celery
and peanut butter, okay?

422
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:27,481
- Dad, you don't have to wait with me.
- I know.

423
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,400
Hi, Shirley.

424
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:38,825
You know what? You know what?
I'm gonna drive him today, okay?

425
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,368
Come on.

426
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,387
What's that?

427
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:02,849
Similarities in the lowercase R's.

428
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,902
- And that?
- It is you waiting in the hall...

429
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,988
...if you speak again.
I have to concentrate.

430
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:20,700
- Sorry.
- "Sorry" counts as speaking.

431
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,880
There are similarities
in the lowercase R's.

432
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,387
We have to release the bus threat.

433
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,974
- It'll screw us.
- We're already screwed.

434
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,226
We just went from
"Routine Cabby Shooting"...

435
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,270
...to "Mass Murderer Targets Kids."

436
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,197
The Zodiac Killer
has come to San Francisco.

437
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:02,367
Confirmation tonight from the
San Francisco Police Department...

438
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,536
...that in his latest taunting letter...

439
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:07,747
...which takes credit for the murder
of cabdriver Paul Stine...

440
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:11,376
...the Zodiac has threatened to, quote,
"Wipe out a school bus...

441
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:15,046
...and pick off the kiddies
as they come bouncing out."

442
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,886
If you think you might know
who the Zodiac is...

443
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:25,182
...you can call the San Francisco
Police Department's newest tip line.

444
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,575
We need policemen out there.

445
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:51,208
Press conference is at 4.
We gotta give them something.

446
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:54,669
We're coordinating with the school
board, and we expect a break soon.

447
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:57,047
- What do we really got?
- We're swamped.

448
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:00,008
When they can't get the tip line,
they call the switchboard.

449
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:04,012
- You got any hard suspects?
- About 90 an hour. I'm up to around 500.

450
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,265
- Can't you narrow it down?
- I would love to, if I could get out...

451
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:08,725
Homicide, please hold.

452
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:12,854
Yeah, hold, please. We're gonna need to
tell them we got the entire force on this.

453
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:16,900
- How many men can you give me?
- You and Bill, and Monday's a school day.

454
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,693
I know. I have three daughters.

455
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:22,113
- Yeah, I know. Where's Armstrong?
- He's on the phone with Vallejo.

456
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:24,032
We're playing catch-up, Jack.

457
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,701
I'd like to set up a meeting
with your Michael Mageau.

458
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,161
I can't. He skipped town.

459
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:31,331
The only guy who's seen Zodiac
without a mask is missing?

460
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:34,417
When he was in the hospital
we could show him lineups all day.

461
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,753
- Soon as he got out, he split.
- Really? Why?

462
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,256
I don't think he wanted
anything to do with this.

463
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,508
Can you send us everything
that you have?

464
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,469
Well, the road goes both ways.

465
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:47,180
Now, we need that print
you lifted from the cab...

466
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,683
...and we should have been
in on the handwriting.

467
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,893
I apologize.
Things have been moving fast.

468
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,688
Who should I talk to in Napa
so we can coordinate?

469
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,106
Talk to Ken Narlow.

470
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,275
We should have been
in on the handwriting.

471
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,902
I apologize.
Things have been moving fast.

472
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,280
- We're gonna need your photos.
- Can't help you.

473
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,615
I don't wanna get into
a jurisdictional thing...

474
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,034
No, no. We didn't have a crime scene.

475
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:11,538
The ranger literally swept everything
into a picnic blanket.

476
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:14,374
- All we have are the Wing Walker prints.
- The what?

477
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:18,837
Boot prints to and from the crime scene
made by size 10-and-a-half Wing Walkers.

478
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,715
Military-style boots
sold only at military PXs.

479
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,925
Designed to walk
on the wings of planes.

480
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,553
And you can't buy at a PX
without a military ID...

481
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,763
...so our suspect could be military.

482
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:31,266
- Did you guys narrow your list off of this?
- Yeah.

483
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:32,976
- Did Vallejo?
- I don't know.

484
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,020
I don't work in Vallejo. I work here.

485
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:39,024
- I'll need photos of those boot prints.
- Sure, if you send me the handwriting.

486
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,859
I thought Questioned Documents did.

487
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,819
Nope. Vallejo's got them, not us.

488
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:46,406
I'll have Questioned Documents...
Forget it. I'll telefax it to you.

489
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,199
We don't have telefax yet.

490
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,785
- Okay, I'll put it in the mail.
- We'll mail ours too.

491
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:54,080
And call Mulanax in Vallejo.
Maybe he can get you a mimeo.

492
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:57,083
- Right.
- Why don't you get a photo off the cast?

493
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:59,586
We'd have to wait
because they don't have a fax.

494
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,296
We don't have a fax, either.

495
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:04,591
- I'm just trying to get us coordinated.
- Have you called Solano?

496
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,426
Why would I call Solano?

497
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:09,804
Because the two kids that got killed
last Christmas were Solano's.

498
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:12,974
- I thought they were Vallejo.
- They were over the county line.

499
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:16,436
- You'll need to coordinate them too.
- Okay.

500
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:19,272
Bill? Can I have a word with you?

501
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:25,362
Where did you see this guy?

502
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,615
We got the call to look
for a Negro male adult...

503
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,075
Where was he?

504
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:33,161
On Jackson. Heading east.
About the middle of the block.

505
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:36,081
- This is three minutes after the shooting?
- Give or take.

506
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,917
- And you were heading east or west?
- We were going west.

507
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,752
So you're on Jackson going west.

508
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,630
So the cab was one block
catty-corner southwest?

509
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:44,839
Correct.

510
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:47,634
- Did you slow down?
- Of course we slowed down.

511
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,969
Listen, Dispatch said
it was a Negro male.

512
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,304
That was corrected.

513
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:54,015
No, but at the time
they hadn't changed it.

514
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:57,977
This guy was white. Right, not in
a hurry. Kind of lumbering along like...

515
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:00,855
Lumbering?
What do you mean, "lumbering"?

516
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:04,734
- Shuffling.
- Stocky? Had a crew cut?

517
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,278
Yeah, that's all correct.

518
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:11,991
Listen, it was dark.
The guy was wearing a dark jacket.

519
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:15,370
- There's no way...
- He would have been covered in blood.

520
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:18,665
Did you stop him?

521
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,502
Did you talk to him?

522
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,046
- Yes? No?
- No.

523
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,674
You need to get with a sketch artist.

524
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,343
We have to put out a new composite
right away.

525
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:38,268
Five persons have been murdered
in the area and in each case, the killer...

526
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,687
"I shall wipe out a school bus
some morning..."

527
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,939
San Francisco police...

528
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:46,860
To see the Stones in concert
this Sunday...

529
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:49,028
The new letters from the Zodiac Killer...

530
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:52,282
...were sent to the City room
ofthe San Francisco Chronicle.

531
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:55,326
Looming. No looming.

532
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:58,329
- Have you considered the water theory?
- What?

533
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:01,791
Every attack takes place near
a body of water or a water-based name.

534
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,961
- This is your water theory?
- Lake Berryessa. Blue Rock Springs.

535
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,380
- Lake Herman.
- Washington and Cherry?

536
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,093
- You think?
- No.

537
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:14,596
I'm reading this book,
Homicide Investigation...

538
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:16,389
...by LeMoyne Snyder...
- "LeMoyne."

539
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:17,932
He says you look for patterns.

540
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:21,269
No. You can't think of this case
in normal police terms.

541
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,730
- Why not?
- You got four crime scenes:

542
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:26,733
Solano, Vallejo, Berryessa and here.

543
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:30,653
Not a single usable print at the
first three or in any of the letters?

544
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:34,240
How does that master criminal come
to the city and leave a bloody latent?

545
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:36,576
I mean, assuming the gloves are his...

546
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:39,037
...he shoots the cabby
and then takes them off?

547
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,246
So it's not his print?

548
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:43,458
Maybe. You're missing the point.
The point is the first attack...

549
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:46,211
- David Faraday and Betty Jensen.
- They both die.

550
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:48,713
From there out,
he only manages to kill the girls.

551
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:51,132
- Not for lack of trying.
- Not for lack of trying.

552
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,886
Mageau lives, Ferrin dies.
Hartnell lives, Shepard dies.

553
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:58,181
He gets so caught up with the women,
he forgets to finish the men.

554
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,683
Plus they're all couples
and all on lovers' lanes.

555
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,560
- Paul Stine is not.
- Exactly.

556
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:04,896
Single male cab driver on Cherry
doesn't fit.

557
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,773
Doesn't fit.

558
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:09,901
So why does Zodiac kill him?

559
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:14,531
He's breaking the pattern.

560
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:26,251
- Yeah?
- Someone claiming to be Zodiac...

561
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:28,253
...called Oakland P.D. a half-hour ago.

562
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,006
Says he's gonna call in on Jim
Dunbar's morning show in three hours.

563
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:34,759
- On television?
- He wants Melvin Belli on to counsel him.

564
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:37,387
All right. All right.
Let's go wake up Melvin.

565
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,307
Animal Crackers?

566
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:43,101
Glove box.

567
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,894
Are these windows bulletproof?

568
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:47,480
Yes, Melvin.
You don't have to lie down back there.

569
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:51,651
This man is a marksman. Could
snuff me out at a moment's notice.

570
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:55,154
- Are you sure you're up for this?
- Don't you worry about me, inspector.

571
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:57,490
I'll be fine when the lights are on.

572
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,576
This man has asked for my help.

573
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,911
The man you're worrying
about snuffing you out?

574
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,331
What are these, cookies?

575
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:07,584
Dear Lord, do you ever clean this car?

576
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:12,088
Shit. KGO must have tipped
other stations.

577
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:23,808
Get him talking.
Convince him to meet you somewhere.

578
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:27,895
If you see an opportunity, we want you
to suggest Old Saint Mary's Church.

579
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:29,480
You'll be tracing the call?

580
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:32,442
You need to keep him
on the line for 15 minutes.

581
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,486
We can do that, can't we, Jim?

582
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:41,159
- Fifteen seconds. Clear the set.
- Clear the set.

583
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:49,125
Here you go, you drunken reprobate.

584
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,794
We interrupt our program
to bring you this bulletin.

585
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:56,215
This special edition of our show,
we are joined by attorney Melvin Belli...

586
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:59,427
...who the Zodiac Killer
personally requested to appear.

587
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:01,596
Finish up, buddy, and put it in the sink.

588
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:04,557
- Good morning, Melvin.
- Good morning, Jim.

589
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:07,935
So the phone lines are open.
Mr. Belli is here.

590
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:11,064
- Here to help, Jim.
- Yes. Here to help.

591
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:16,736
And we ask the public not to call in
so that the Zodiac himself can reach us.

592
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:27,455
I saw your Star Trek, by the way.
It was excellent.

593
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:31,918
A shame about the show.
Good people.

594
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:35,588
You know, I've often thought
of becoming an actor full-time.

595
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,757
- What was your character's name?
- Gorgan.

596
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:40,051
Gorgan. That's right.

597
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:44,764
- Roll the tape. Get the tape.
- Jim, we have a call. We're going live.

598
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:48,643
Hello?

599
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:54,440
Hello? This is Melvin Belli.

600
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,943
Who am I speaking with?

601
00:44:57,111 --> 00:45:00,363
This is the Zodiac speaking.

602
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:06,744
Is there something I can call you
that's a little less ominous?

603
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:11,457
Sam.

604
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:16,129
Is there somewhere we can meet,
Sam, and talk about this?

605
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:21,342
Meet me on top of the Fairmont Hotel
without anyone else or I'll...

606
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,429
- Have a unit go to the Fairmont Hotel.
- Sam.

607
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,389
Yes?

608
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:29,976
Do you think
you need medical care?

609
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,978
Medical, not mental.

610
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:34,355
Do you have health problems?

611
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:36,190
I'm sick. I have headaches.

612
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:38,025
Headaches?

613
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:41,821
I have headaches, too, but a chiropractor
stopped them a week ago.

614
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:44,699
I think I can help you, Sam.

615
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,910
Sam?

616
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:51,706
He knows they're tracing his calls.

617
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:59,422
Sam, we'd like you to know
that we are not tracing these calls.

618
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:04,552
It's a long, difficult process
and ineffective with these short calls.

619
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,392
Sam?

620
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:16,731
We're not tracing these calls.
You have my word.

621
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:18,483
Okay.

622
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:22,195
Sam, you need to tell me
what your problem is.

623
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:26,657
I don't want to go to the gas chamber.
I have headaches. I kill, I don't get them.

624
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:28,201
That is fucked up.

625
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:31,245
You want to live, don't you?
Well, this is your passport.

626
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:33,289
How long have you
been having headaches?

627
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,958
Since I killed a kid.

628
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:38,336
- Do you have blackouts?
- Yes.

629
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:42,507
- Do you have fits?
- No, I just have headaches.

630
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:45,426
Did you attempt to call
when F. Lee Bailey was with us...

631
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:47,178
...two or three weeks ago?

632
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:49,514
- Yes.
- Why did you wanna talk to Mr. Bailey?

633
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:52,725
Why do you wanna talk to me, Sam?

634
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,936
- I don't want to be hurt.
- Why is he calling?

635
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:56,479
Hey, just a second, buddy.

636
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,689
You won't get hurt if you talk to me.

637
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:01,108
And you're not going
to the gas chamber.

638
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:03,945
I wouldn't think they would
ask for capital punishment.

639
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:08,115
We should ask the district attorney.
Do you want me to do that, Sam?

640
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:11,494
Do you want me
to talk to the district attorney?

641
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:16,624
What was that, Sam?

642
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,460
I did not say anything.

643
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:22,213
We heard a scream.

644
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:25,424
That was my headache.

645
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:29,303
You sound like you're in
a great deal of pain.

646
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:33,349
My head aches. I'm so sick.

647
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,351
I'm gonna kill them.

648
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:38,646
- Okay.
- I'm gonna kill those kids!

649
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:40,940
Fantastic.

650
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:44,485
Sam?

651
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:48,531
Let's meet and talk. Just us.

652
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,324
Okay.

653
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:52,952
How about Old Saint Mary's Church
in Chinatown?

654
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:58,291
No. In front of the Daly City
St. Vincent De Paul at 10:30.

655
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:00,585
I'll see you there.

656
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,963
Take care of yourself, Sam.

657
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:33,242
My, my, my. You fellows certainly know
how to put on a secret meeting.

658
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:34,911
Belli, over here.

659
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:42,501
I don't want to go to the gas chamber.
I have headaches. I kill, I don't get them.

660
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:45,004
No, it's not him.

661
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:48,090
It's the voice. The voice is too high.
It's too young.

662
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:50,718
All right.
Thanks for coming down, Bryan.

663
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,055
That's okay. I got it.

664
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:04,231
They pulled off the trace. Our Daly City
no-show called from a mental institution.

665
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:08,778
Oakland P.D.'s operator is sure the man
she talked to had a deeper voice.

666
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:13,240
Calmer. Might have actually been him.

667
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:21,749
"So I shall change my way
of collecting slaves.

668
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:26,253
I shall no longer announce to anyone
when I commit my murders.

669
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:29,507
They shall look like routine robberies,
killings of anger...

670
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:32,426
...and a few fake accidents, et cetera.

671
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:36,013
The police shall never catch me,
because I have been too clever for them.

672
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:39,892
I look like the description passed out
only when I do my thing.

673
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,853
The rest of the time
I look entirely different.

674
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:47,900
I shall not tell you what my disguise
consists of when I kill.

675
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:50,778
As of yet I have left
no fingerprints behind me...

676
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:53,406
...contrary to what the police say.

677
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:56,742
I wear transparent fingertips.

678
00:49:56,910 --> 00:50:01,497
All it is is two coats of airplane cement
coated on my fingertips.

679
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:05,793
I enjoy needling the blue pigs.
Hey, blue pig, I was in the park.

680
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:11,465
You were using firetrucks to mask
the sound of your cruising prowl cars.

681
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:15,302
Hey, pig, doesn't it rile you up to have
your nose rubbed in your boo-boos?

682
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:19,473
If you cops think I am going to take
on a bus the way I stated I was...

683
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:23,436
...you deserve to have
holes in your heads."

684
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,148
And you need to look at this.

685
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:32,028
"Take one bag
of ammonium-nitrate fertilizer...

686
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:36,323
...one gallon of stove oil and
dump a few bags of gravel on top..."

687
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:37,992
- Okay.
- It's a bomb.

688
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,410
We gotta call the Army...

689
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:42,413
...and see if this science experiment
could actually work.

690
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,707
Another cipher.

691
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:49,420
- When did these arrive?
- They arrived this morning.

692
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:52,381
- Are you planning to publish?
- Robert.

693
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,426
We should have a drink.

694
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:01,223
Thank you.

695
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:06,187
So tell me about yourself.
You married?

696
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:09,523
Divorced. I have two kids.

697
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:11,692
What do you do for fun?

698
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:15,112
I love to read.

699
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:17,698
- I enjoy books.
- Those are the same things.

700
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:20,451
Why you been going through my trash?

701
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:27,583
We'll come back to that. How'd
you know he'd send another code?

702
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:28,876
I just guessed.

703
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:31,837
- You just guessed.
- The first one seemed too easy.

704
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:34,173
All right, this can no longer be ignored.

705
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:35,966
What is that you're drinking?

706
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:38,010
It's an Aqua Velva.

707
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:40,221
You wouldn't make fun of it
if you tried it.

708
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:52,775
But who actually cracked the code?

709
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:57,780
A married couple who liked puzzles.
So, what's that tell us about the Zodiac?

710
00:51:58,406 --> 00:52:01,367
- He's no expert.
- Right. It's a simple substitution code...

711
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,744
...like the one that we used to do
as Boy Scouts.

712
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:07,540
- A is one, B is two.
- We weren't all Boy Scouts, Robert.

713
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:10,584
Well, it's not that hard.
You just gotta know where to start.

714
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:13,754
- In the first cipher...
- You actually carry that around with you?

715
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:16,423
- Why?
- No reason.

716
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:19,635
What's the most common double
consonant in the English language?

717
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:21,679
- Consonant?
- The double L.

718
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:23,681
- Double L.
- And what's the one word...

719
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:26,475
...that we know
that he'll use in here, at least once?

720
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:27,810
- "Kill."
- Right, "kill."

721
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:31,564
The Hardens start look for double
symbols, which they find here and here...

722
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:33,858
...each with the same symbols
preceding them.

723
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:38,028
They've got a repeating four-letter word
ending with two symbols that stand for L.

724
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:41,365
- Since they think the word is "kill"...
- You got your K, your I...

725
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:42,867
...and you're on your way.

726
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:46,537
But how do you go from A is one, B
is two to figuring out this whole code?

727
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:50,082
Well, same way I did.
You go to the library.

728
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:54,753
In this book...

729
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:58,841
...the author presents a very simple
substitution code in the preface.

730
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,927
Eight of the 26 symbols he suggests
are found in this cipher.

731
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:04,930
But there are non-letter symbols.
There's these medieval ones.

732
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:07,266
I thought they looked medieval too.

733
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:12,062
But I found a code written in
the Middle Ages. Guess what it's called.

734
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,607
The zodiac alphabet.

735
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:17,610
Jesus.

736
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:20,696
- What do you want out of this?
- What?

737
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:24,533
What's your angle? This is
good business for everyone but you.

738
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:29,330
How do you mean "business"?

739
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,543
Hey. Come to bed.

740
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:37,755
I'll be up in a minute.
I need to make a phone call.

741
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:52,019
- Hello?
- Bill?

742
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:54,521
There's not many basements
in California.

743
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:56,190
"Basement for future use."

744
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:58,192
That's right.

745
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:03,030
I'll have Vallejo and Napa check
with their city planners. Get some sleep.

746
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:04,990
Yeah, sure.

747
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:19,755
"Dear Melvin,
this is the Zodiac speaking.

748
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:22,383
I wish you a happy Christmas.

749
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:26,053
The one thing I ask of you is this:
Please help me.

750
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:29,765
I cannot reach out for help,
because this thing in me won't let me."

751
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:30,975
Thank you.

752
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:34,395
"I am finding it extremely difficult
to hold it in check...

753
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:38,148
...and I am afraid I will lose control again
and take my ninth...

754
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:39,984
...and possibly 10th victim."

755
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:42,319
Melvin, he's reaching out to you.

756
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:47,241
Absolutely. Inspectors, he sent
this letter directly to my residence.

757
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:50,369
It is a cry for help
intended as a private communiqu.

758
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,788
Which is why you contacted
the Chronicle.

759
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,874
The people have a right to know.
Toddy?

760
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:59,044
- When did the letter arrive?
- In the middle of last week.

761
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:03,257
I was away on safari. What did you
gentlemen do for Christmas?

762
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:05,968
- You're looking at it.
- You must see Africa.

763
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,887
Cradle of civilization.
Fascinating people.

764
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:11,015
Beautiful, savages.

765
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:14,810
- Back to the killer who wrote to you.
- Yes, of course.

766
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:17,104
It is my belief
that he penned this letter...

767
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:19,940
...because he couldn't get to me
on the show or here.

768
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:22,526
- He tried to contact you here?
- Several times.

769
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:24,862
I was out,
but he spoke with my housekeeper.

770
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:27,197
- Didn't leave a number.
- He's crafty like that.

771
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:29,533
- Do you mind if I speak to her?
- Not at all.

772
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:32,077
But the real story is the letter.

773
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:34,163
- I'll be back.
- Yeah.

774
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:37,124
- She's right this way.
- Inspector Toschi...

775
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:40,669
...it is my belief this is a window
into this man's soul.

776
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,588
Killing is his compulsion.

777
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:46,467
Even though he tries to ignore it,
it drives him. It's in his blood.

778
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:49,470
Could be.
Or maybe he just likes the attention.

779
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:39,019
I didn't mean to scare you,
but your right rear wheel is loose.

780
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:40,854
- Really?
- lf you like...

781
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:43,440
...I could tighten the lugs up for you.

782
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:50,114
- lf you don't mind.
- Well, you can't be too careful.

783
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:27,067
- All done.
- Thank you.

784
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:29,945
No problem. Have a good night.

785
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:35,701
It's okay.

786
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:31,131
Are you okay?

787
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,552
Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.

788
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:40,557
Must have been worse than I thought.
I can give you a lift to a service station.

789
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:45,270
Okay.

790
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:53,779
It's okay. Come on.

791
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:04,248
I didn't know you had a baby.

792
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,917
Oh, is that okay?

793
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:10,003
The more, the merrier.

794
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:22,307
You shouldn't smoke. It's a bad habit.

795
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:31,108
I think we just passed a filling station.

796
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:33,277
It was closed.

797
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:40,617
Do you always go around
helping people in the night?

798
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:43,954
When I'm done with them,
they don't need much help.

799
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:48,584
It's okay.

800
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,961
Before I kill you...

801
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:53,755
...I'm gonna throw your baby
out the window.

802
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:12,441
Please! No!

803
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:19,031
She was on the side of the road.

804
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:20,907
- She flagged me down.
- What happened?

805
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:23,994
She said she jumped from a car.
I found her like this.

806
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:27,164
- What is it?
- Please, he said...

807
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:29,416
- It'll be okay.
- Tried to kill me.

808
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:32,753
- My baby!
- Where's her baby?

809
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,088
She didn't have one when I stopped.

810
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:36,923
Where's your baby?

811
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:44,973
Jesus.

812
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:55,359
- You hid it?
- In case he came back.

813
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:11,041
"This is the Zodiac speaking.

814
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:14,920
By the way, have you cracked
the last cipher I sent you?

815
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:18,048
I'm mildly curious as to how much
money you have on my head now.

816
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:21,510
I hope you do not think I was the one
who wiped out that blue meanie...

817
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:24,638
...with a bomb at the cop station...

818
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:27,391
...even though I talked about
killing children with one."

819
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,934
"This is the Zodiac speaking.

820
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:32,896
I'd like to see some nice Zodiac buttons
wandering around town.

821
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:34,773
Everyone else has these buttons...

822
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:38,110
...like peace, black power,
'Melvin eats blubber,' et cetera.

823
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:41,196
It would cheer me up if I saw
a lot of people wearing my button.

824
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:45,033
- Please no nasty ones."
- "This is the Zodiac speaking.

825
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:50,914
I shot a man sitting in a parked car
with a .38. Zodiac 12, S.F.P.D.0.

826
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:54,251
The map coupled with this code
will tell you where the bomb is set.

827
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:57,754
You have until next fall to dig it up."

828
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:01,508
"This is the Zodiac speaking.

829
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:05,345
I'm rather unhappy because you people
will not wear some nice Zodiac buttons.

830
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:08,140
I now have a list,
starting with the woman and her baby...

831
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:11,309
...I gave an interesting ride
a few months back...

832
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:13,979
...that ended in my burning her car
where I found them."

833
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:16,231
We're not gonna run
any more of his letters?

834
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:20,610
New policy. Our brothers in blue want us
to hold back and see how he reacts.

835
01:02:20,778 --> 01:02:24,781
Four letters in three months and this is
the first mention of Kathleen Johns?

836
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:29,661
- That's very weird.
- That's because he's full of shit.

837
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:32,164
What do you mean?

838
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:34,791
You don't know?

839
01:02:36,377 --> 01:02:41,173
Welcome. Please put your stuff down.
You're going down five rows and left.

840
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:43,717
Looking for the Modesto Bee
from March.

841
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:46,720
I'm going to stand here
and attempt not to vomit.

842
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:49,014
Left.

843
01:02:50,057 --> 01:02:52,434
- What am I looking for?
- Kathleen Johns.

844
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:57,314
Also probably wanna pull the Chron...
You know, never mind. I'll see to that.

845
01:02:57,899 --> 01:03:00,650
Look at this letter again,
the part about Kathleen Johns.

846
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:02,486
Tell me what facts he gives.

847
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:05,447
- A woman and a baby abducted.
- Fact.

848
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:10,452
- The car on fire.
- Okay, now...

849
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:13,830
...look at the article from the Bee.

850
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:16,583
See it yet?

851
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:18,710
Everything already appeared
in the article.

852
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:20,545
And he's done it before.

853
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:24,132
Officer Radetich,
shot sitting in his car.

854
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,593
Zodiac claimed
that he shot someone in their car.

855
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:31,181
Couple days after this article came out.
Police already had somebody in custody.

856
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:33,183
Zodiac didn't do it...

857
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:36,520
...but took credit for it anyway
because he's in it for the press.

858
01:03:36,687 --> 01:03:38,688
- He even stole his symbol.
- What?

859
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:42,526
Yeah. Shit. If I show you something,
you promise not to tell anyone?

860
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:46,696
- Who would I tell?
- Okay. Totally solid point. Okay.

861
01:03:53,538 --> 01:03:55,539
That's the only place
that word and symbol...

862
01:03:55,706 --> 01:03:57,707
...appeared together before the letters.

863
01:03:57,875 --> 01:04:01,211
- The guy stole his logo off a watch.
- How can somebody who's killed 13...

864
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:04,381
He claims he's killed 13 people,
but which ones can we confirm?

865
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:07,884
There's three in Vallejo, one
in Berryessa, the cabby. That's it.

866
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:12,180
Bobby, you almost look disappointed.

867
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:15,767
Chief's pulling everybody off buses.

868
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:19,813
- Business as usual.
- Something will shake loose.

869
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:24,526
Not a peep in four months.
First he won't shut up and now...

870
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:27,487
Maybe we drove him underground.

871
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:29,406
Maybe he's gone.

872
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:33,201
3-11 at 582 Haight, cross at Fillmore.
There's a male...

873
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:36,079
- Happy birthday, Bill.
- Thanks.

874
01:04:45,756 --> 01:04:48,300
Does it ever bother you
that people call you Shorty?

875
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:50,844
Does it bother you
that people call you a retard?

876
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:53,805
- Nobody calls me that.
- Right.

877
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:56,766
As governor,
I pledge to use all my influence...

878
01:04:58,769 --> 01:05:01,771
...to make sure Darlene Ferrin's
killer is brought to justice.

879
01:05:01,939 --> 01:05:06,693
I believe some clues were overlooked
in the murder of Darlene Ferrin.

880
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:08,862
- Her murder was premeditated.
- Who is that?

881
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:11,781
Florence Douglas, mayor of Vallejo.
Running for governor.

882
01:05:11,949 --> 01:05:14,618
I believe the police department
did not have the money...

883
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:16,328
...or, yes, the inclination...

884
01:05:16,495 --> 01:05:20,415
Sayonara, police endorsement.
Good work, Flo.

885
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:23,793
Does anyone ever call me names, or...?

886
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:27,339
- You mean like retard?
- Yeah.

887
01:05:28,132 --> 01:05:29,591
No.

888
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:38,516
Shit. Fuck. My God. Jesus.

889
01:05:41,812 --> 01:05:45,565
Tell me that's not a piece of
bloody shirt! Fuck! Holy fucking crap!

890
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:48,151
I feel it in my bones
You ache to know my name

891
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:51,821
And so I'll clue you in
But then, why spoil the game?

892
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:53,365
"Happy Halloween."

893
01:05:54,992 --> 01:05:58,828
Paul, you did call him
a latent homosexual...

894
01:05:58,996 --> 01:06:03,833
...in at least one of your articles.
- Dave. I want a gun.

895
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:07,003
A gun?

896
01:06:11,342 --> 01:06:13,009
You're in Herb Caen.

897
01:06:13,177 --> 01:06:17,097
"Paul Avery's investigation has won him
a message from the Zodiac warning:

898
01:06:17,264 --> 01:06:18,598
'You are doomed."

899
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:22,102
As a result, several crime newsmen
are wearing lapel buttons reading:

900
01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:24,270
'I am not Paul Avery."

901
01:06:24,438 --> 01:06:26,606
You should sell these.
You could do well.

902
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:29,776
It's been a windfall since they published
the threat on my life.

903
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:33,822
I got leads coming out of the woodwork.
There's one guy down in Riverside.

904
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:36,157
I'm gonna see him tonight.
You wanna tag along?

905
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:39,536
No, I have a date.

906
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:42,080
- Really?
- Who is this guy?

907
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:46,209
He wishes to remain anonymous.
I wish to remain infamous.

908
01:06:46,377 --> 01:06:49,337
So we're going to get along great.

909
01:06:56,929 --> 01:06:59,222
Hi. Good evening.
Hi. I'm looking for a Melanie.

910
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:03,393
- It's the young lady sitting by herself.
- Thank you.

911
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:10,608
You must be Melanie.

912
01:07:10,776 --> 01:07:12,610
- Which would make you Robert.
- It would.

913
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:15,739
Glynnis told me lots about you.

914
01:07:15,906 --> 01:07:17,866
- And you have wine, great.
- I do.

915
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:20,577
Great. How late am I?

916
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:24,122
Just a few minutes, really.
I just got here myself.

917
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:26,916
Traffic was bumper-to-bumper.
I was at the gun range.

918
01:07:27,084 --> 01:07:29,252
Glynnis said you were a cartoonist.

919
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:30,795
Oh, yeah.

920
01:07:30,963 --> 01:07:33,465
- Well, what are you doing at a gun range?
- Reading.

921
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:37,719
Get some more...
You need some more napkins.

922
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:40,388
So you work with Glynnis.

923
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:42,807
- For her, actually.
- For her?

924
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:44,642
Oh, well...

925
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:48,229
My children are terrified of Glynnis.

926
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:49,522
Me too.

927
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:56,029
- So the gun range?
- Oh, we were... I'm working on...

928
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:57,739
- Do you know the Zodiac?
- Yeah.

929
01:07:57,907 --> 01:08:00,075
I'm working with...
You know who Paul Avery is?

930
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:03,078
- Sounds familiar.
- He's the writer the Zodiac threatened.

931
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:06,956
- Oh, yeah, I saw that on TV.
- Well, I work near him...

932
01:08:07,124 --> 01:08:11,461
...and he was going down tonight to
track an anonymous tipster in Riverside.

933
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:13,630
Where is Riverside?

934
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:15,757
It's near L.A.

935
01:08:16,467 --> 01:08:19,761
I don't think Paul knows
that it's that far away.

936
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:23,556
Sounds kind of dangerous.

937
01:08:24,809 --> 01:08:27,811
Yeah. How do you mean?

938
01:08:27,978 --> 01:08:30,230
Well, you said it was
an anonymous tip, right?

939
01:08:30,397 --> 01:08:31,731
Yeah.

940
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:35,151
So it could be an ambush.
I mean, it could be the Zodiac.

941
01:08:36,987 --> 01:08:39,322
Don't you think it's kind of stupid?

942
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:42,200
Yeah, yeah. Well, Paul has a gun.

943
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:49,249
So do you know what's good here?

944
01:08:50,417 --> 01:08:52,335
I've never been here before.

945
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:57,048
The pasta, spaghetti?

946
01:08:58,217 --> 01:09:00,343
Are you ready to order yet?

947
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:04,180
I'll have the penne vodka,
but do it in a cream sauce.

948
01:09:04,348 --> 01:09:05,974
Of course.

949
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:12,564
Maybe give us another minute?

950
01:09:14,608 --> 01:09:16,192
Do you have any change?

951
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:18,820
Oh, wait. No, wait, hold on.

952
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:21,906
- Nope. That's a penny.
- Do you have to make a phone call?

953
01:09:22,074 --> 01:09:25,910
Yeah, you know, when you were
saying that the Zodiac...?

954
01:09:26,078 --> 01:09:29,372
When you said it was dangerous,
I thought that it is dangerous, and...

955
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:30,582
- Stupid?
- Stupid.

956
01:09:30,749 --> 01:09:35,879
And I just thought that I should call his
wife and just see if she's heard from him.

957
01:09:37,882 --> 01:09:39,424
I have some change.

958
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:01,613
Okay. Well, she said she'd call
when she heard from him.

959
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:04,115
- Good.
- Yeah.

960
01:10:04,408 --> 01:10:08,912
Melanie, I should really go home
and wait for the call.

961
01:10:11,415 --> 01:10:14,167
Is this some sleazy plan
to get me to go home with you?

962
01:10:15,586 --> 01:10:17,128
What? No.

963
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:21,591
I'll get the food to go.

964
01:10:23,177 --> 01:10:24,510
Hello!

965
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:43,613
Hi! I'm supposed
to meet somebody here.

966
01:11:01,465 --> 01:11:03,132
Anything?

967
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:08,596
- You don't have to stay.
- Are you kidding?

968
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:12,642
This is the most interesting date
I've ever had.

969
01:11:16,855 --> 01:11:17,897
- Paul?
- Robert?

970
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:19,565
- Yes.
- You sitting down?

971
01:11:19,733 --> 01:11:22,735
- Yes.
- You're not gonna believe this.

972
01:11:22,903 --> 01:11:24,612
- Dave.
- In a bizarre twist...

973
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:26,531
...the hunted has become hunter.

974
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:30,410
San Francisco Chronicle reporter
and Zodiac target Paul Avery...

975
01:11:30,577 --> 01:11:32,745
...claims to have uncovered
new information...

976
01:11:32,913 --> 01:11:36,582
...regarding the only unsolved homicide
in Riverside County's history...

977
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:40,169
...a 1966 Southern California murder...

978
01:11:40,337 --> 01:11:43,923
...that Avery now believes
was the Zodiac's first victim.

979
01:11:44,091 --> 01:11:45,425
- What?
- He didn't call you?

980
01:11:45,592 --> 01:11:48,094
- Hang on.
- The Riverside killer wrote to the press...

981
01:11:48,262 --> 01:11:51,347
...letters that I took to
the Office of Questioned Documents.

982
01:11:51,515 --> 01:11:53,433
And what did this expert tell you?

983
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,310
What I knew in my gut, Ron.

984
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:57,687
The handwriting matches Zodiac's.

985
01:11:57,855 --> 01:11:59,897
How'd he get the evidence
out of Riverside?

986
01:12:00,065 --> 01:12:02,358
He took it to Sherwood
without telling us.

987
01:12:02,526 --> 01:12:06,237
- You know how bad this looks?
- How do we know that this lead is real?

988
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:10,867
It's very real. You know how I know?
Because I saw it on TV.

989
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:19,500
- Excuse me.
- Dave? Hi.

990
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:22,128
You know Mel Nicolai.
He's working the case.

991
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:23,629
Good to see you again, Mel.

992
01:12:23,797 --> 01:12:27,091
Can someone explain to me why
I'm reading about breaks in this case...

993
01:12:27,259 --> 01:12:29,260
...instead of getting calls from you?

994
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:31,012
- We got screwed.
- Dave, come on.

995
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:33,598
You do get your name in the paper a lot.
People talk.

996
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:36,809
I don't ever talk about an open
investigation, period. Okay, Ken?

997
01:12:36,977 --> 01:12:40,355
Dave? Hey. Hi. Paul Avery.

998
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:44,525
- Can I catch a ride with you gents...?
- Not a good idea, Paul.

999
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:48,237
He's gonna make me take a cab
when we're going to the same place.

1000
01:12:48,405 --> 01:12:50,740
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for choosing PSA.

1001
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:53,242
- Fair enough. Fair enough.
- Please take your seats.

1002
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:55,912
Remember, smoking
is in the last six aisles only.

1003
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,206
Enjoy your flight.

1004
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:05,338
Captain Cross?
Hi, Inspector Dave Toschi, S.F.P.D.

1005
01:13:05,506 --> 01:13:07,673
- How you doing?
- Great. Thanks for having us.

1006
01:13:07,841 --> 01:13:10,301
Oh, not at all.
I hear you have some files for us.

1007
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:12,762
- I'll show you mine, you show me yours.
- Frisco?

1008
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:14,931
- Right, San Francisco.
- Oh, San Francisco.

1009
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:16,516
- Ken Narlow from Napa.
- Ken.

1010
01:13:16,683 --> 01:13:18,351
- Mel Nicolai, Justice.
- Mel.

1011
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:22,230
Here's what we know. Cheri Jo Bates
attended Riverside Community College.

1012
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:26,359
She studies in the library
the night of October 30th, 1966.

1013
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:30,446
She leaves with an unidentified male
at closing, 9 p.m.

1014
01:13:30,614 --> 01:13:34,158
Her body's found the next morning
in a parking lot, stabbed to death.

1015
01:13:34,326 --> 01:13:35,451
Her car is disabled.

1016
01:13:35,619 --> 01:13:38,413
Someone cut the coil to the distributor,
the battery died.

1017
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:41,040
That someone comes back,
offers to help.

1018
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:43,334
- Like Kathleen Johns.
- Who?

1019
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:46,129
A woman outside of Modesto.
Might be a Zodiac victim.

1020
01:13:46,296 --> 01:13:49,382
Might. Might be.
I have her account right here in this file.

1021
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:50,967
Okay.

1022
01:13:51,135 --> 01:13:54,470
A typewritten confession was sent
to the Riverside Press-Enterprise...

1023
01:13:54,638 --> 01:13:57,140
...on November 29th,
a month after Bates' murder.

1024
01:13:57,307 --> 01:13:58,975
They ran it.

1025
01:14:00,727 --> 01:14:03,563
"I"m not sick. I am insane.
But that will not stop the game.

1026
01:14:03,730 --> 01:14:05,815
This should be published
for all to read."

1027
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:09,193
He wants to be published. He calls it
a game. This could be our boy.

1028
01:14:09,361 --> 01:14:12,363
Six months later, the police,
the girl's father and the paper...

1029
01:14:12,531 --> 01:14:14,490
...they all received these.

1030
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:21,164
Double postage, just like Zodiac.

1031
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:25,418
These are what Sherwood Morrill
matched to the Zodiac letters?

1032
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:27,295
These and the desktop. Don.

1033
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:32,258
This was found a couple of months later
by a janitor in RCC storage.

1034
01:14:41,185 --> 01:14:44,562
Sherwood got a handwriting match
off wood?

1035
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:47,523
Who etches in their own handwriting?

1036
01:14:47,691 --> 01:14:51,235
To be honest with you, our letters
and your letters, I don't see it.

1037
01:14:51,403 --> 01:14:54,238
How did Paul Avery
get his hands on the exemplars?

1038
01:14:54,406 --> 01:14:57,450
I gave them to him. We talked
on the phone for about an hour.

1039
01:14:57,618 --> 01:15:00,828
- And I told him you were gonna be here.
- You told him we were meeting?

1040
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:03,414
Yeah. I also told him
we don't think this is Zodiac.

1041
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:06,501
Okay, wait a minute.
You don't think this is Zodiac?

1042
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:08,169
We got a guy we like for it.

1043
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:11,214
We don't have enough to pin him yet,
but we're sure it's him.

1044
01:15:11,381 --> 01:15:14,258
If you don't think this is Zodiac,
why give anything to Avery?

1045
01:15:14,426 --> 01:15:17,053
- I'm trying to cooperate.
- That's how you cooperate...

1046
01:15:17,221 --> 01:15:19,055
...by giving information to reporters?

1047
01:15:19,223 --> 01:15:22,016
About the handwriting,
Sherwood says it's a match, right?

1048
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:25,686
So let's just say that your guy did
Cheri Jo. He types the confession.

1049
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:29,106
Zodiac reads it in the paper
and writes a letter taking credit for it.

1050
01:15:29,274 --> 01:15:33,319
- Now, that's something he's done before.
- Look, now you have everything we have.

1051
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:36,822
But in my opinion,
you guys came south for nothing.

1052
01:15:36,990 --> 01:15:39,075
FUBAR, gentlemen. FUBAR.

1053
01:15:39,243 --> 01:15:41,869
I don't care what he says.
This still could be Z.

1054
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:44,997
The problem is the entire state
already thinks it is.

1055
01:15:45,165 --> 01:15:48,251
Well, there's your press agent.
Talk to him about it.

1056
01:15:51,088 --> 01:15:53,256
I come in peace.
I don't want trouble. Dave.

1057
01:15:53,423 --> 01:15:56,300
- I don't want to talk to you now.
- Just trying to do my job.

1058
01:15:56,468 --> 01:15:59,178
Oh, really? Well, now I can't do mine.

1059
01:15:59,346 --> 01:16:03,057
We're screwed with the amount of tips
and you freaked out the entire state.

1060
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:06,477
I have got Napa, Vallejo,
and DOJ looking at me sideways...

1061
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:09,272
...and Riverside's telling me
I'm on a snipe hunt!

1062
01:16:09,439 --> 01:16:11,607
Cheri Jo Bates was a gift.
I gave that to you.

1063
01:16:11,775 --> 01:16:13,859
You and Armstrong
never would have found her.

1064
01:16:14,027 --> 01:16:16,112
This might not be Zodiac.
That matter to you?

1065
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:19,657
That Riverside may not be able
to make a case against their suspect?

1066
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:22,493
I'm out here, beating the bushes,
trying to draw him out.

1067
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:25,413
- We're in this together.
- We're not in anything together.

1068
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:27,790
- I don't want to up my circulation.
- Boy.

1069
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:29,750
He wrote me. He threatened my life.

1070
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:33,838
Hey, Bullitt. Been a year and a half,
you gonna catch this fucking guy or not?

1071
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:39,969
- Go fuck yourself.
- Happily.

1072
01:16:40,137 --> 01:16:42,138
You should have called me, Paul.

1073
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:49,353
Thank you.

1074
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,826
- Did you see this?
- Unfortunately.

1075
01:17:03,994 --> 01:17:06,829
Here comes every lunatic in California.

1076
01:17:07,664 --> 01:17:10,541
- I'm the Zodiac.
- And how did you kill your victims?

1077
01:17:10,709 --> 01:17:13,586
With a gun. No, with a hammer.

1078
01:17:13,754 --> 01:17:16,672
All I'm authorized to say
is he's under government employment.

1079
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:19,675
- And who authorized you?
- That's all I'm authorized to say.

1080
01:17:19,843 --> 01:17:21,927
Only a little rat bastard like Andre...

1081
01:17:22,095 --> 01:17:24,388
...could have cut off
all the victims' hands.

1082
01:17:24,556 --> 01:17:26,807
Zodiac didn't cut off
any of the victims' hands.

1083
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:28,684
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

1084
01:17:28,852 --> 01:17:31,437
Travis and I work here
side by side for 10 years.

1085
01:17:31,605 --> 01:17:35,274
His foot gets crushed in an accident
and the killings begin.

1086
01:17:35,442 --> 01:17:36,609
Coincidence?

1087
01:17:36,777 --> 01:17:39,195
- I don't know.
- You're a cop, man. Do the math.

1088
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:46,369
Have you considered the killer
might be Paul Avery?

1089
01:17:46,536 --> 01:17:47,620
Frequently.

1090
01:17:49,706 --> 01:17:50,706
He was drinking Coors,
getting a load on.

1091
01:17:50,874 --> 01:17:53,959
Starts talking about hunting people.
Like that book.

1092
01:17:54,127 --> 01:17:58,130
Says how you can put a light at the end
of a gun to use as a sight in the dark.

1093
01:17:58,298 --> 01:18:00,091
- He said that?
- Yeah.

1094
01:18:01,468 --> 01:18:03,469
So I asked,
"How would you get away with it?"

1095
01:18:03,637 --> 01:18:07,390
And he said, "It would be easy because
there'd be no real motive to the thing."

1096
01:18:07,557 --> 01:18:11,394
He said he'd write letters to the police,
call himself Zodiac to mess with them.

1097
01:18:11,561 --> 01:18:15,439
- Leigh liked messing with people.
- You're positive he said, "Zodiac"?

1098
01:18:15,607 --> 01:18:19,235
Yeah. I thought it was a stupid name.
So I told him.

1099
01:18:19,403 --> 01:18:22,238
He got up all upset and said,
"I don't care what you think.

1100
01:18:22,406 --> 01:18:25,574
I've thought about it a long time.
That's the name I'm gonna use."

1101
01:18:25,742 --> 01:18:28,953
Did you feel like he'd been
thinking about it a long time?

1102
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:32,415
He was raw about losing his job
at the school.

1103
01:18:32,582 --> 01:18:35,543
He talked about shooting out
the tires of a school bus...

1104
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:38,003
...and picking off the "little darlings."

1105
01:18:38,171 --> 01:18:41,841
- He actually used those words?
- That's what made me remember.

1106
01:18:42,008 --> 01:18:46,554
Afterwards, I told my wife I didn't wanna
see him again. And I haven't since.

1107
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:49,140
Other thing is, Leigh's into skin diving.

1108
01:18:49,307 --> 01:18:51,434
He's been up to that lake
a bunch of times.

1109
01:18:51,601 --> 01:18:53,811
Lake Berryessa?
Did you ever go with him?

1110
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:57,565
Couple times. We went fishing
by Putah Creek near there.

1111
01:18:57,733 --> 01:19:01,861
- Tell him when you put it together.
- About a year ago, in the paper...

1112
01:19:02,028 --> 01:19:04,405
...there was a story about the Zodiac.

1113
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:07,241
And it all comes back.
I tried to call the local cops...

1114
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:10,411
- Blew him off. Thought he was a nut.
- And you're sure...

1115
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:12,913
...the conversation you had
about Zodiac...

1116
01:19:13,081 --> 01:19:16,959
...took place on January 1 st, 1968?

1117
01:19:17,127 --> 01:19:18,711
It couldn't have been any later.

1118
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:23,674
I started a new job in L.A.
on January 20th. I had to move.

1119
01:19:23,842 --> 01:19:26,343
- This is my problem. This guy...
- Arthur Leigh Allen?

1120
01:19:26,511 --> 01:19:30,514
This guy just lays out his entire evil plan
to a fishing buddy on New Year's Day?

1121
01:19:30,682 --> 01:19:32,975
I don't know. He's angry.
He's been drinking.

1122
01:19:33,143 --> 01:19:35,644
Been thinking about it for a while.
I can buy that.

1123
01:19:35,812 --> 01:19:38,063
So why didn't Cheney
contact us sooner?

1124
01:19:38,231 --> 01:19:39,732
I checked. He did.

1125
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:43,027
First recorded contact with
the police department about Allen...

1126
01:19:43,195 --> 01:19:46,781
...was in Pomona, January 10th, 1970.
He just got lost in the shuffle.

1127
01:19:46,948 --> 01:19:50,034
Did Cheney have anything against Allen?
Did Allen screw his wife?

1128
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:54,955
We're gonna do a full background check.
But I gotta tell you, I like this guy.

1129
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:57,708
So let's pull some handwriting samples.

1130
01:19:59,211 --> 01:20:02,505
Hi. I talked to Sherwood.
He got the samples.

1131
01:20:02,672 --> 01:20:05,090
- What are you having?
- BLT.

1132
01:20:06,968 --> 01:20:09,804
The check stubs are a wash.
There's not enough handwriting.

1133
01:20:09,971 --> 01:20:12,640
The application's got more,
but he can't rule him in.

1134
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:14,475
But he can't rule him out, either.

1135
01:20:14,643 --> 01:20:17,978
- Well, that's vague.
- He needs more samples.

1136
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:23,025
Also, our guy is a pervert. When Mel got
the application from Valley Springs...

1137
01:20:23,193 --> 01:20:25,861
...they told him Allen had been fired
for touching kids.

1138
01:20:26,029 --> 01:20:29,114
- "Touching"?
- Polite euphemism.

1139
01:20:29,866 --> 01:20:33,118
- So, what do you wanna do?
- Make some phone calls.

1140
01:20:33,286 --> 01:20:35,788
- Are you done with the fries?
- Go ahead.

1141
01:20:35,956 --> 01:20:39,708
Did you have a chance to look at
the copies of the Zodiac letters we sent?

1142
01:20:39,876 --> 01:20:42,294
Yeah. Some of this stuff
is pretty creepy.

1143
01:20:42,462 --> 01:20:45,756
- Yeah, we know.
- I mean creepy like Leigh.

1144
01:20:45,924 --> 01:20:48,551
He misspells words like that.
He thinks it's funny.

1145
01:20:48,718 --> 01:20:50,177
What about the handwriting?

1146
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:53,138
I don't know.
Don't you have experts for that stuff?

1147
01:20:53,306 --> 01:20:56,308
Our man at Questioned Documents
says it's inconclusive.

1148
01:20:56,476 --> 01:20:58,394
Maybe he did it with his other hand.

1149
01:20:58,562 --> 01:21:02,398
The letters are too neat for someone
to have written with the wrong hand.

1150
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:04,984
- But not for Leigh, right?
- What do you mean?

1151
01:21:05,151 --> 01:21:09,697
He's ambidextrous. He can write with
either hand. Didn't you guys know that?

1152
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:12,199
In everyday life, Allen uses his left hand.

1153
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:15,202
Job applications, letters to friends,
et cetera.

1154
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:18,038
But he writes the Zodiac letters
with his right hand...

1155
01:21:18,206 --> 01:21:21,834
...producing a different handwriting
that he can't be linked to.

1156
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:24,253
- We gotta see this guy, chief.
- Where is he?

1157
01:21:24,421 --> 01:21:28,173
Vallejo. He works at Union Oil in Pinole.
His brother's up there too.

1158
01:21:28,341 --> 01:21:32,094
See them both. Make sure
you call Mulanax. It is his backyard.

1159
01:21:32,262 --> 01:21:35,306
Oh, right, because that worked so well
for us in Riverside.

1160
01:21:35,599 --> 01:21:38,100
Cooperation, that's us, at all costs.

1161
01:21:48,111 --> 01:21:49,737
You can talk to him in here.

1162
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:52,448
Coke machine's busted, by the way.

1163
01:21:53,033 --> 01:21:54,992
I'll go get him for you.

1164
01:21:56,202 --> 01:21:58,495
So how do you guys wanna do this?

1165
01:21:58,663 --> 01:22:01,498
Well, Bill talked to the informants.
He leads, we follow?

1166
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:04,043
It's okay by me.

1167
01:22:17,807 --> 01:22:21,477
Mr. Allen, I'm Inspector Bill Armstrong.
This is Inspector Dave Toschi...

1168
01:22:21,645 --> 01:22:23,312
...and Sergeant Jack Mulanax.

1169
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:27,650
We're investigating the Zodiac murders
in San Francisco and Vallejo.

1170
01:22:28,151 --> 01:22:29,860
Please sit down.

1171
01:22:38,495 --> 01:22:41,163
The informant notified us
you made certain statements...

1172
01:22:41,331 --> 01:22:43,832
...eleven months prior
to the first Zodiac murder.

1173
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,502
If they're true,
they're quite incriminating.

1174
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:49,672
- You recall having any such conversation?
- No.

1175
01:22:49,839 --> 01:22:52,466
Have you ever read or heard anything
about the Zodiac?

1176
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:55,761
When it was first in the paper,
but I didn't follow it after.

1177
01:22:55,929 --> 01:22:57,346
Why not?

1178
01:22:57,514 --> 01:22:59,306
Too morbid.

1179
01:22:59,474 --> 01:23:01,558
I told all this to the other officer.

1180
01:23:02,519 --> 01:23:04,770
- Which other officer?
- From Vallejo.

1181
01:23:06,106 --> 01:23:07,690
Do you remember his name?

1182
01:23:07,857 --> 01:23:11,193
No, but it was right after
the murder at the lake.

1183
01:23:11,361 --> 01:23:13,862
And what did you tell this officer?

1184
01:23:15,782 --> 01:23:20,494
I told him that I'd gone to Salt Point
that weekend to skin dive...

1185
01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:23,372
...that I was alone
but I met a couple there.

1186
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:26,000
I have their names at home
if you want them.

1187
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:29,086
- That would be great, Arthur.
- Leigh.

1188
01:23:29,254 --> 01:23:33,966
- What?
- Leigh. Nobody calls me Arthur.

1189
01:23:34,884 --> 01:23:38,053
Also, that day when I came home,
my neighbor saw me.

1190
01:23:38,221 --> 01:23:42,224
It was around 4.
But I forgot to tell the other officer that.

1191
01:23:42,392 --> 01:23:45,060
- Neighbor's name?
- Bill White.

1192
01:23:46,229 --> 01:23:48,147
He died a week or so afterwards.

1193
01:23:48,314 --> 01:23:51,692
Heart attack.
So I didn't think to call to follow up.

1194
01:23:53,611 --> 01:23:56,071
The knives I had in my car
with the blood on them...

1195
01:23:56,239 --> 01:23:59,450
...that blood came from a chicken
that I killed for dinner.

1196
01:24:02,412 --> 01:24:05,122
- What?
- I had knives in my car that weekend.

1197
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:09,626
Maybe Bill saw them
and called the other officer on me.

1198
01:24:10,336 --> 01:24:12,755
Well, we'll be checking in on that.

1199
01:24:12,922 --> 01:24:14,798
Well, let me ask you something else.

1200
01:24:14,966 --> 01:24:19,344
Were you ever in Southern California
at any time in 1966?

1201
01:24:19,512 --> 01:24:21,555
Is this about the Riverside killing?

1202
01:24:21,723 --> 01:24:23,432
Yes.

1203
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:27,394
Well, I guess I was there around that
time. I used to go down there a lot.

1204
01:24:27,562 --> 01:24:29,897
I like the auto races.

1205
01:24:33,568 --> 01:24:35,986
Informant says
that you're ambidextrous?

1206
01:24:36,154 --> 01:24:37,905
No, that's untrue.

1207
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:40,449
You can't write with both hands?

1208
01:24:41,618 --> 01:24:43,911
My teachers tried to make me
when I was a kid...

1209
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:46,747
...but I couldn't. I'm left-handed.

1210
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:50,667
He also said that you made statements
about killing school children.

1211
01:24:51,836 --> 01:24:54,088
That is... That is horrible.

1212
01:24:54,255 --> 01:24:56,673
That is... That's a horrible thing to say.

1213
01:24:56,841 --> 01:24:59,968
So you weren't angry
about being fired from Valley Springs...

1214
01:25:00,136 --> 01:25:02,096
...for touching your students?

1215
01:25:11,648 --> 01:25:13,982
I'm not the Zodiac.

1216
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:17,569
And if I was,
I certainly wouldn't tell you.

1217
01:25:19,864 --> 01:25:22,116
That's a nice watch.

1218
01:25:23,159 --> 01:25:25,244
- Thank you.
- May I see it?

1219
01:25:27,705 --> 01:25:29,373
May I see it?

1220
01:25:40,593 --> 01:25:41,760
Where'd you get it?

1221
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:45,264
A Christmas gift
from my mother two years ago.

1222
01:25:45,431 --> 01:25:46,849
That's very sweet.

1223
01:25:47,058 --> 01:25:50,727
So tell me something, Arthur.
You don't remember anyone...

1224
01:25:50,895 --> 01:25:54,565
...you might have had a conversation
with regarding Zodiac?

1225
01:25:56,192 --> 01:26:02,489
Maybe Ted Kidder or Phil Tucker
at Vallejo Recreation.

1226
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:06,702
But I couldn't be positive.
I used to work there...

1227
01:26:10,540 --> 01:26:13,125
The Most Dangerous Game.

1228
01:26:14,085 --> 01:26:16,044
- What?
- The Most Dangerous Game.

1229
01:26:16,212 --> 01:26:19,715
That's why you're here, isn't it?
It was my favorite book in high school.

1230
01:26:19,883 --> 01:26:23,385
It's about this man who waits for people
to get shipwrecked on his island.

1231
01:26:23,553 --> 01:26:26,889
He was tired of hunting animals,
he hunted people for the challenge.

1232
01:26:27,056 --> 01:26:30,392
And "Man is the most dangerous
animal of all"?

1233
01:26:31,269 --> 01:26:33,395
That's the whole point of the story.

1234
01:26:34,397 --> 01:26:35,772
Great book.

1235
01:26:36,983 --> 01:26:39,651
Or at least that's what I told Phil.

1236
01:26:45,241 --> 01:26:47,117
May I go?

1237
01:26:50,163 --> 01:26:51,538
Sure.

1238
01:26:56,085 --> 01:26:59,922
- Thanks for your time.
- I'm willing to help in any way possible.

1239
01:27:00,465 --> 01:27:02,341
I look forward to the day...

1240
01:27:02,508 --> 01:27:06,261
...when police officers
are no longer referred to as "pigs."

1241
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:08,764
Thanks.

1242
01:27:09,349 --> 01:27:10,849
We'll be in touch.

1243
01:27:22,779 --> 01:27:26,490
So does anyone think this suspect
warrants further investigation?

1244
01:27:26,824 --> 01:27:29,826
These are copies of some of
the Zodiac letters that were sent.

1245
01:27:31,454 --> 01:27:33,205
We'd like you to take a look at them.

1246
01:27:33,706 --> 01:27:35,749
You think my brother's the Zodiac.

1247
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:39,169
- Well, we're looking at him.
- Are you going to arrest him?

1248
01:27:39,337 --> 01:27:43,131
Mrs. Allen, we don't arrest people
just because we're interested in them.

1249
01:27:43,299 --> 01:27:46,969
- Well, Leigh's always been troubled.
- Is it true about the children?

1250
01:27:47,637 --> 01:27:51,556
Unfortunately. We don't see him much
anymore since we found out.

1251
01:27:51,724 --> 01:27:53,976
What are your feelings
about Don Cheney?

1252
01:27:54,143 --> 01:27:57,437
Don Cheney? My old roommate?
Was he the one who contacted you?

1253
01:27:57,605 --> 01:28:00,899
- That's confidential.
- Well, Don's a very reliable guy.

1254
01:28:01,067 --> 01:28:04,236
If he were to tell you something,
I'd believe it to be true.

1255
01:28:04,404 --> 01:28:05,612
- This one.
- What about it?

1256
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:07,781
Here, he spells Christmas with two S's.

1257
01:28:07,949 --> 01:28:11,994
We got a Christmas card from Leigh
years ago. He spelled it the same way.

1258
01:28:12,161 --> 01:28:14,538
- "Christ-mass."
- Would you still have that?

1259
01:28:14,706 --> 01:28:17,457
- I can look for it.
- Thank you. That'd be great.

1260
01:28:19,002 --> 01:28:21,003
Is there anything else we can do to help?

1261
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:24,006
Brother said he'd search Leigh's
apartment next time he went.

1262
01:28:24,173 --> 01:28:26,508
- Gets you around the warrant.
- For the time being.

1263
01:28:26,676 --> 01:28:28,010
If we do find something...

1264
01:28:28,177 --> 01:28:31,638
...Mulanax will go to the DA
and we could search the place properly.

1265
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:35,851
I talked to the cop who interviewed Allen
two days after the Berryessa murders.

1266
01:28:36,019 --> 01:28:39,813
Doesn't remember how he got onto him,
but didn't think he looked like a killer...

1267
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:42,149
...so he didn't like him for Z.
- But you do?

1268
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:45,569
- I wish I could've taken the guy in there.
- Take it slow, Dave.

1269
01:28:45,737 --> 01:28:49,239
Find more stuff for Sherwood. A match
will get us farther on the warrants.

1270
01:28:49,407 --> 01:28:52,409
- Avery's on 2.
- Tell him to screw.

1271
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:56,538
You want me to communicate
that verbatim or can I spice it up a little?

1272
01:29:06,674 --> 01:29:08,675
Christ, kid.

1273
01:29:09,927 --> 01:29:11,470
- Yeah?
- Paul, I've been thinking.

1274
01:29:11,637 --> 01:29:13,013
Oh, God, save us all.

1275
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:16,183
The letter to Melvin Belli was sent
exactly one year after...

1276
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:19,394
...the Lake Herman murder.
The one to Cheri Jo Bates' father...

1277
01:29:19,562 --> 01:29:21,855
...was sent exactly six months
after her death.

1278
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:24,274
- She was killed a day before Halloween.
- Yeah.

1279
01:29:24,442 --> 01:29:27,194
- You received a Halloween card.
- These are fascinating...

1280
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:30,530
...pieces of minutia, Robert.
It's a bit early in the day.

1281
01:29:30,698 --> 01:29:34,534
Well, Paul, it's 11:00
and you missed editorial.

1282
01:29:38,414 --> 01:29:41,708
- I didn't mean to wake you up. I just...
- No, no, no.

1283
01:29:47,131 --> 01:29:50,050
This suspect is not your Zodiac.

1284
01:29:51,427 --> 01:29:54,805
This sample matches the canceled
checks and the application?

1285
01:29:54,972 --> 01:29:57,140
- Perfectly.
- So we've retested the left hand.

1286
01:29:57,308 --> 01:29:59,434
- We know he's ambidextrous.
- In 38 years...

1287
01:29:59,602 --> 01:30:01,770
...l've never seen anyone
that ambidextrous.

1288
01:30:01,938 --> 01:30:03,897
Both hands would have commonalities.

1289
01:30:04,941 --> 01:30:08,402
I'm sorry. Just not gonna work.

1290
01:30:10,279 --> 01:30:12,614
- Homicide, Toschi.
- Dave, it's Jack Mulanax.

1291
01:30:12,782 --> 01:30:14,950
Right, Mulanax. Yeah?

1292
01:30:15,118 --> 01:30:18,203
We struck out with the judge.
He won't sign off on a warrant.

1293
01:30:18,371 --> 01:30:20,038
- Why not?
- Said it wasn't enough.

1294
01:30:20,206 --> 01:30:22,999
Unless we bring him a handwriting match
or some evidence...

1295
01:30:23,167 --> 01:30:25,085
Well, how are we gonna get evidence?

1296
01:30:25,253 --> 01:30:26,962
I don't know.

1297
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:30,507
- I truly am sorry.
- No, I know. I thank you, Jack.

1298
01:30:32,009 --> 01:30:34,344
- What do you wanna do?
- Don't know what I can do.

1299
01:30:34,512 --> 01:30:37,556
We need Allen's right hand.
We can't get it without a warrant.

1300
01:30:37,723 --> 01:30:39,850
Are there other guys
you should be looking at?

1301
01:30:40,017 --> 01:30:43,270
- Only, what...?
- Twenty-three hundred?

1302
01:30:43,896 --> 01:30:50,152
Okay, then.

1303
01:31:17,638 --> 01:31:20,348
Paul, you wrote
the Justice Department...

1304
01:31:20,516 --> 01:31:24,060
...asking to be put in charge
of the Zodiac investigation?

1305
01:31:26,105 --> 01:31:28,690
- I merely suggested...
- On our letterhead?

1306
01:31:28,858 --> 01:31:32,819
- that those with knowledge of the case
create an information clearinghouse...

1307
01:31:32,987 --> 01:31:35,322
...to promote an exchange
and free flow of ideas.

1308
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:38,283
- And that you run it.
- Well, who better than me?

1309
01:31:39,577 --> 01:31:40,827
The marked man.

1310
01:31:41,829 --> 01:31:45,540
Paul, if you wanna work here,
I need three things: One, stop boozing.

1311
01:31:45,708 --> 01:31:48,710
Two, stop doing whatever else
it is you're doing.

1312
01:31:48,878 --> 01:31:52,130
And three, cut this nonsense out.

1313
01:31:52,298 --> 01:31:55,467
Sweetest of Templetons,
if at any time...

1314
01:31:55,635 --> 01:32:00,847
...you feel my excellent work is no longer
in step with this trashy provincial rag...

1315
01:32:01,015 --> 01:32:02,599
...I'll more than happily...

1316
01:32:02,767 --> 01:32:05,894
More than happily decamp
for greener pastures.

1317
01:32:06,062 --> 01:32:07,896
Paul, I mean it.

1318
01:32:18,032 --> 01:32:19,908
- Paul?
- Yep?

1319
01:32:20,117 --> 01:32:21,576
What was that?

1320
01:32:21,744 --> 01:32:24,120
An editorial tte--tte.

1321
01:32:24,288 --> 01:32:26,456
- Wanna grab a drink?
- It's 10 in the morning.

1322
01:32:26,624 --> 01:32:31,336
- Late breakfast? Early lunch, or...
- Paul.

1323
01:32:34,048 --> 01:32:35,715
Are you okay?

1324
01:32:36,425 --> 01:32:37,759
No.

1325
01:32:40,888 --> 01:32:42,722
Thank you for asking.

1326
01:32:45,017 --> 01:32:46,184
- Shorty!
- Yes?

1327
01:32:46,352 --> 01:32:49,271
- Let's go out for one.
- Paul, where are you going?

1328
01:32:51,232 --> 01:32:52,941
So you moved off my brother-in-law?

1329
01:32:53,734 --> 01:32:55,860
We couldn't get a warrant.

1330
01:32:57,613 --> 01:33:00,740
Last year we arranged for Leigh
to get help from a social worker.

1331
01:33:00,908 --> 01:33:05,579
He only went twice. We saw him recently
for the first time in nine months.

1332
01:33:05,746 --> 01:33:08,748
My mother-in-law brought him by
to see the new baby.

1333
01:33:08,916 --> 01:33:11,918
After he left,
I went to see that social worker.

1334
01:33:12,086 --> 01:33:15,046
He couldn't talk about a former patient,
so I just asked him...

1335
01:33:15,214 --> 01:33:17,841
...if he thought Leigh
was capable of killing people.

1336
01:33:18,009 --> 01:33:21,344
- Because of patient confidentiality...
- The man said yes.

1337
01:33:23,097 --> 01:33:25,056
Why hadn't you seen him
in nine months?

1338
01:33:25,224 --> 01:33:27,142
He's going to school in Santa Rosa.

1339
01:33:27,310 --> 01:33:30,770
- Santa Rosa? Where is he living?
- In his trailer.

1340
01:33:30,938 --> 01:33:32,647
- In Santa Rosa?
- Sonoma County.

1341
01:33:32,815 --> 01:33:35,025
We wouldn't have to go through
the Vallejo DA.

1342
01:33:35,192 --> 01:33:38,236
It's been 11 months
and now you wanna search his trailer?

1343
01:33:38,404 --> 01:33:40,071
If we find something, great.

1344
01:33:40,239 --> 01:33:43,408
If not, we get his prints and handwriting
samples from both hands.

1345
01:33:43,576 --> 01:33:45,619
I thought Sherwood shut you down.

1346
01:33:46,787 --> 01:33:48,955
What if I can get a second opinion?

1347
01:33:50,333 --> 01:33:52,792
I don't wanna step on Sherwood's toes.
He trained me.

1348
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:55,670
All I need to know
is if the suspect is ambidextrous...

1349
01:33:55,838 --> 01:33:59,674
...could he possibly have written
those letters with his other hand?

1350
01:34:00,968 --> 01:34:02,135
Between you and me?

1351
01:34:02,303 --> 01:34:05,680
Because there are differing
schools of thought on this...

1352
01:34:07,016 --> 01:34:11,227
Get the samples of his other hand.
If he's the Zodiac, you'll get a match.

1353
01:34:11,395 --> 01:34:14,189
That's the current thinking,
according to Terry Pascoe.

1354
01:34:14,357 --> 01:34:17,150
I spoke to a psychologist
who'd be willing to testify...

1355
01:34:17,318 --> 01:34:20,487
...that someone who undergoes
a personality change like Zodiac...

1356
01:34:20,655 --> 01:34:23,490
...would manifest it physically,
altering his handwriting.

1357
01:34:23,658 --> 01:34:27,243
Which is why Sherwood couldn't
get a match from Allen's samples.

1358
01:34:27,411 --> 01:34:29,579
We got Terry Pascoe,
this psychology guy...

1359
01:34:29,747 --> 01:34:32,457
...coupled with Cheney,
it could be enough for a warrant.

1360
01:34:32,625 --> 01:34:33,958
Get Cheney on the record.

1361
01:34:34,126 --> 01:34:38,004
"...and that he would
call himself 'Zodiac.'"

1362
01:34:38,172 --> 01:34:40,590
- Yes.
- And you're willing to swear to this...

1363
01:34:40,758 --> 01:34:42,676
...under oath, in superior court?

1364
01:34:42,843 --> 01:34:44,177
Without any hesitation.

1365
01:34:44,345 --> 01:34:47,514
Thank you very much, Mr. Cheney.
Thank you very much for your time.

1366
01:34:47,682 --> 01:34:49,683
- Thank you.
- Suspect is Arthur Leigh Allen.

1367
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:53,603
Lives in Sunset Trailer Court
in Santa Rosa, California.

1368
01:34:53,771 --> 01:34:55,230
Physical description:

1369
01:34:55,398 --> 01:34:58,066
Allen is similar in height, weight
and build to a man...

1370
01:34:58,234 --> 01:35:00,819
...seen at Lake Berryessa
on the day of the stabbings.

1371
01:35:00,986 --> 01:35:03,947
I understand he doesn't look like
the San Francisco composite.

1372
01:35:04,115 --> 01:35:07,909
Height and weight are sketchy. Lumbering
Caucasian with a crewcut is right on.

1373
01:35:08,077 --> 01:35:10,078
We never had confidence
in the composite.

1374
01:35:10,246 --> 01:35:13,623
The patrolman who saw Zodiac
said he didn't look much like the sketch.

1375
01:35:13,791 --> 01:35:15,333
Military boot prints.

1376
01:35:15,501 --> 01:35:18,086
Allen was in the Navy,
wears a size 10 and a half...

1377
01:35:18,254 --> 01:35:20,672
...same size as the prints
found at Berryessa.

1378
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:22,507
What about gun?

1379
01:35:22,675 --> 01:35:25,844
Cheney says Allen
owns several firearms.

1380
01:35:26,011 --> 01:35:28,263
- We'll list them in the warrant.
- And the ciphers?

1381
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:30,432
Could be code training in the Navy.

1382
01:35:30,599 --> 01:35:32,684
And people have seen Allen
with ciphers.

1383
01:35:32,852 --> 01:35:35,645
- Really. Who?
- That would be his sister-in-law...

1384
01:35:35,813 --> 01:35:39,232
...and a man named Phil Tucker that
he worked with at a pool in Vallejo.

1385
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:42,777
Phil Tucker told us about
a conversation that he had with Allen...

1386
01:35:42,945 --> 01:35:45,530
...about how to attach a flashlight
to a gun.

1387
01:35:45,698 --> 01:35:48,908
That gives us two sources on the ciphers
and two on the flashlight.

1388
01:35:49,076 --> 01:35:50,952
What about his threats on children?

1389
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:54,748
Suspect worked for elementary schools
and was fired for molestation...

1390
01:35:54,915 --> 01:35:57,041
...in March, April '68.
Could give him motive.

1391
01:35:57,209 --> 01:36:01,004
At the very least, it's home turf.
He'd have knowledge of bus routes...

1392
01:36:01,172 --> 01:36:03,798
...which the two major threats
centered around.

1393
01:36:03,966 --> 01:36:05,550
What about the bomb?

1394
01:36:06,927 --> 01:36:09,971
- Allen works as a chemist.
- Take him through the geography.

1395
01:36:10,556 --> 01:36:11,931
Vallejo murders:

1396
01:36:12,099 --> 01:36:15,435
Allen lives in Vallejo
with his mother in her basement.

1397
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:18,813
Berryessa murder: On the day
that the two kids were stabbed...

1398
01:36:18,981 --> 01:36:21,566
...his neighbor saw bloody knives
in his truck...

1399
01:36:21,734 --> 01:36:24,027
...which he claimed were used
to kill a chicken.

1400
01:36:24,695 --> 01:36:26,488
Does he have any alibis?

1401
01:36:26,655 --> 01:36:29,532
He claimed he did, but he's been
unable to produce the names...

1402
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:32,911
...of the couple he supposedly met
on the day of Berryessa.

1403
01:36:33,078 --> 01:36:36,998
The bottom line is Allen can't alibi up.
Riverside, Vallejo, the lake or us.

1404
01:36:37,166 --> 01:36:39,334
- Wanna tell him about the name?
- What name?

1405
01:36:39,502 --> 01:36:44,923
Zodiac. Allen wears a watch that bears
both the word and crosshair symbol.

1406
01:36:45,090 --> 01:36:48,885
He mentioned Zodiac to Cheney a year
and a half before it appeared in a letter.

1407
01:36:51,889 --> 01:36:54,307
- John?
- That's pretty good, guys.

1408
01:36:54,475 --> 01:36:57,811
- We think so too.
- Let's take it to a judge.

1409
01:37:17,832 --> 01:37:20,834
Mr. Allen? This is the
Santa Rosa Police Department.

1410
01:37:21,001 --> 01:37:23,670
We have a warrant
to search your residence.

1411
01:37:35,015 --> 01:37:36,349
Hello?

1412
01:37:45,025 --> 01:37:46,901
I'll check with the neighbors.

1413
01:37:48,529 --> 01:37:50,029
- Close the door.
- Close the door.

1414
01:37:50,197 --> 01:37:52,282
There's rodents running around.

1415
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:07,463
Neighbor said he tore out of here
about half-hour ago.

1416
01:38:07,631 --> 01:38:11,134
- You think somebody tipped him?
- We're not leaving till he comes back.

1417
01:38:17,683 --> 01:38:19,017
I'll check the back.

1418
01:38:32,281 --> 01:38:34,032
- Jesus.
- What?

1419
01:38:34,199 --> 01:38:35,617
Squirrels.

1420
01:38:37,202 --> 01:38:38,703
Piece of work, this guy.

1421
01:38:46,003 --> 01:38:48,212
Not one, but two blue windbreakers.

1422
01:38:48,380 --> 01:38:51,925
- Like the Stine scene?
- We'll have those checked for blood.

1423
01:38:53,052 --> 01:38:56,763
And a pair of black gloves.

1424
01:38:57,181 --> 01:39:00,266
Men's 7, just like the ones
we found in the cab.

1425
01:39:00,893 --> 01:39:03,311
Well, he's got the same size shoes
and gloves as Z.

1426
01:39:03,479 --> 01:39:05,521
Probably just a coincidence.

1427
01:39:05,689 --> 01:39:10,318
Dave, I got a gun.
Check that. Two guns.

1428
01:39:11,111 --> 01:39:13,905
Both.22s. One automatic, one revolver.

1429
01:39:14,073 --> 01:39:15,406
Well, that's interesting.

1430
01:39:15,574 --> 01:39:18,701
Because he happens to have an M-1 rifle
here in the closet.

1431
01:39:18,869 --> 01:39:21,412
For little darlings bouncing off buses.

1432
01:39:22,957 --> 01:39:24,457
Someone's here.

1433
01:39:31,590 --> 01:39:34,801
Hello, Arthur. Remember us?

1434
01:39:56,532 --> 01:39:58,658
- No.
- On the handwriting?

1435
01:39:58,826 --> 01:40:01,869
Ballistics, no match. Prints, no match.
Writing, no match.

1436
01:40:02,037 --> 01:40:05,999
On both hands, right? Because
we got handwriting from both his hands.

1437
01:40:06,166 --> 01:40:07,500
And neither hand matches.

1438
01:40:07,668 --> 01:40:11,337
- Forget Sherwood. Get another opinion.
- Fellas, he's not your guy.

1439
01:40:17,928 --> 01:40:19,429
Damn it.

1440
01:40:26,478 --> 01:40:28,271
Hey.

1441
01:40:28,439 --> 01:40:30,023
What do you want?

1442
01:40:30,190 --> 01:40:31,733
Time off?

1443
01:40:33,068 --> 01:40:34,652
A hug?

1444
01:40:35,070 --> 01:40:37,071
Do you know
what the worst part of this is?

1445
01:40:37,239 --> 01:40:40,992
I can't tell if I wanted it to be Allen
so bad because I thought it was him...

1446
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:42,660
...or I want this to be over.

1447
01:40:42,828 --> 01:40:46,706
It's because you thought it was him.
And I did too.

1448
01:40:48,917 --> 01:40:50,626
You know what? Take some time off.

1449
01:40:50,794 --> 01:40:53,379
Spend some time
with your wife and the kids.

1450
01:40:53,756 --> 01:40:57,133
Go to Candlestick. See a movie.

1451
01:40:59,553 --> 01:41:03,056
"To the city of San Francisco,
I will enjoy killing one person every day...

1452
01:41:03,223 --> 01:41:06,309
...until you pay me $100,000.

1453
01:41:06,477 --> 01:41:09,812
If you agree, say so tomorrow morning...

1454
01:41:09,980 --> 01:41:12,899
...in the personal column
San Francisco Chronicle...

1455
01:41:13,067 --> 01:41:14,901
...and I will set up meeting.

1456
01:41:15,069 --> 01:41:16,903
If I do not hear from you...

1457
01:41:17,071 --> 01:41:20,239
...it will be my next pleasure
to kill a Catholic priest or a..."

1458
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:25,078
"Scorpio."

1459
01:41:27,081 --> 01:41:28,706
Who's out of their minds?

1460
01:41:28,874 --> 01:41:30,291
I've gotta get out of here.

1461
01:41:30,459 --> 01:41:33,544
Where the hell does he expect me
to find $100,000?

1462
01:41:33,712 --> 01:41:36,380
You're not thinking of paying him,
are you, Mr. Mayor?

1463
01:41:36,548 --> 01:41:40,551
The city of San Francisco does not
pay criminals not to commit crime.

1464
01:41:44,973 --> 01:41:49,560
- Chief, who's in charge of this?
- Inspector Callahan. Waiting outside.

1465
01:42:03,784 --> 01:42:06,661
The killer gets shot in the chest.

1466
01:42:06,829 --> 01:42:09,914
- That's how the... That's how it ends.
- Do I know you?

1467
01:42:10,082 --> 01:42:13,584
I'm Robert Graysmith.
I work at the Chronicle with Paul Avery.

1468
01:42:13,752 --> 01:42:15,211
Dave Toschi. Nice to meet you.

1469
01:42:15,379 --> 01:42:17,880
That Callahan
did a hell of a job with your case.

1470
01:42:18,048 --> 01:42:21,342
Yeah. No need for due process, right?

1471
01:42:24,972 --> 01:42:27,056
- What do you do?
- I'm a cartoonist.

1472
01:42:27,224 --> 01:42:29,559
- That's nice.
- You're gonna catch him.

1473
01:42:32,104 --> 01:42:34,730
Pal, they're already
making movies about it.

1474
01:42:42,322 --> 01:42:45,449
We today have
concluded an agreement...

1475
01:42:45,617 --> 01:42:49,162
...to end the war and bring
peace with honor in Vietnam.

1476
01:42:49,329 --> 01:42:52,081
- Charles Manson for
the Tate-LaBianca mass murders.

1477
01:42:52,249 --> 01:42:54,625
- pleaded guilty in the Chowchilla
kidnapping case.

1478
01:42:54,793 --> 01:42:57,044
- murder trial of Juan Corona,
with the slaying...

1479
01:42:57,212 --> 01:42:59,130
Chairman Mao died today. He was...

1480
01:42:59,298 --> 01:43:01,465
- an absolute pardon
unto Richard Nixon...

1481
01:43:01,633 --> 01:43:04,677
Well, I'm not a crook.
I've earned everything I've got.

1482
01:43:04,845 --> 01:43:06,554
- Roe against Wade.

1483
01:43:06,722 --> 01:43:09,432
- has now led to the death
of 50,000 Americans...

1484
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:12,852
...and several
hundred thousand Vietnamese.

1485
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:16,480
Patricia Hearst was kidnapped
by the Symbionese Liberation Army.

1486
01:43:16,648 --> 01:43:18,482
- stand up together and say,
"No more."

1487
01:43:18,650 --> 01:43:20,610
- sanctions to put an end to apartheid.

1488
01:43:20,777 --> 01:43:23,154
Your Declaration of Independence
broke that link...

1489
01:43:23,322 --> 01:43:25,698
Americans admire
the United Kingdom...

1490
01:43:25,866 --> 01:43:27,700
Mr. Hoffa has disappeared.

1491
01:43:27,868 --> 01:43:31,621
- that if we despise
our own government...

1492
01:43:31,788 --> 01:43:35,124
- that the police have captured a man
they believe to be the Son of Sam.

1493
01:43:52,267 --> 01:43:56,354
Hi. We haven't met.
I'm Robert Graysmith.

1494
01:43:56,521 --> 01:43:58,397
I'm Duffy Jennings.

1495
01:43:58,565 --> 01:44:01,359
- Nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you, man.

1496
01:44:01,735 --> 01:44:05,029
You got a great desk. Guy who
used to work here was a great reporter.

1497
01:44:05,197 --> 01:44:09,075
Oh, yeah. Oh, I'm sure he was. I mean,
it's a honor to leave the Chronicle...

1498
01:44:09,243 --> 01:44:11,535
...and go work for the Sacramento Bee.

1499
01:44:11,703 --> 01:44:13,996
Dare to dream, right, Robert?

1500
01:44:17,834 --> 01:44:20,419
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

1501
01:44:20,587 --> 01:44:22,922
I'm just right down there
at the Art Department...

1502
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:24,882
...if you need anything, Duffy.

1503
01:44:28,929 --> 01:44:31,722
- You sure you don't want the car, Bill?
- It's your turn.

1504
01:44:31,890 --> 01:44:34,976
You could just drop me off at my place
and take the car.

1505
01:44:35,143 --> 01:44:36,978
You should keep the car.

1506
01:44:37,145 --> 01:44:38,437
Yeah?

1507
01:44:39,231 --> 01:44:41,232
I'm not coming in tomorrow.

1508
01:44:43,277 --> 01:44:45,236
Why? What's up?

1509
01:44:46,238 --> 01:44:47,613
I'm done.

1510
01:44:48,782 --> 01:44:51,242
I put in for a transfer.

1511
01:44:56,915 --> 01:45:00,209
- Where?
- Looking at Fraud.

1512
01:45:02,296 --> 01:45:04,922
I can't be on call anymore.

1513
01:45:07,134 --> 01:45:10,052
I wanna see these kids grow up.

1514
01:45:10,470 --> 01:45:13,431
Hey, good for you, Bill.

1515
01:45:14,641 --> 01:45:17,643
- You'll be okay.
- Yeah. I'll be fine.

1516
01:45:19,313 --> 01:45:20,688
Hey...

1517
01:45:21,565 --> 01:45:25,568
...I'm not leaving you holding the bag
on anything, am I?

1518
01:45:26,611 --> 01:45:28,029
No.

1519
01:45:30,073 --> 01:45:31,574
Okay.

1520
01:45:31,742 --> 01:45:33,242
Hey, you know what?

1521
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:37,955
Maybe you'll have a chance
to try your Japanese food, the raw stuff.

1522
01:45:39,124 --> 01:45:40,583
Yeah.

1523
01:46:12,616 --> 01:46:14,867
"I'm not Paul Avery."

1524
01:46:16,787 --> 01:46:19,789
The boys need to be tucked in
and the baby needs changing.

1525
01:46:19,956 --> 01:46:23,042
- I'll flip you for it.
- You wish.

1526
01:46:25,837 --> 01:46:28,839
Nobody has more Zodiac crap
than you do.

1527
01:47:13,135 --> 01:47:15,553
- Are you kidding me?
- Hi, Paul.

1528
01:47:16,888 --> 01:47:19,181
Permission to come aboard.

1529
01:47:19,349 --> 01:47:22,226
Right there. You got shoes on.
This is perfect right here.

1530
01:47:22,394 --> 01:47:24,812
- That's the one.
- Okay.

1531
01:47:25,814 --> 01:47:27,565
See that? Mesmerizing.

1532
01:47:27,732 --> 01:47:31,819
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. My own kids
would kill me for one of those.

1533
01:47:33,196 --> 01:47:35,698
- How are you?
- Fantastic.

1534
01:47:35,866 --> 01:47:40,077
I mean, admittedly, the Bee ain't exactly
the Chron, but fuck it, right?

1535
01:47:40,245 --> 01:47:43,164
Do you want a drink?
I don't have anything blue, but I got...

1536
01:47:43,331 --> 01:47:45,416
Don't worry about that.
Don't worry about it.

1537
01:47:45,584 --> 01:47:49,086
It's no bother at all.
Nobody comes by from the old days.

1538
01:47:49,254 --> 01:47:50,504
Cheers.

1539
01:47:51,089 --> 01:47:53,466
To your health and mine.

1540
01:47:55,218 --> 01:47:57,094
Mostly mine.

1541
01:48:05,479 --> 01:48:06,812
So, what's new?

1542
01:48:08,815 --> 01:48:11,859
I've been thinking.
Somebody should write a book.

1543
01:48:12,027 --> 01:48:15,154
Somebody should write a fucking book,
that's for sure.

1544
01:48:15,322 --> 01:48:17,907
- About what?
- About Zodiac.

1545
01:48:18,825 --> 01:48:20,326
It's not new.

1546
01:48:20,494 --> 01:48:24,413
I've been thinking that
if you put all the information together...

1547
01:48:24,581 --> 01:48:27,583
...maybe you could jog something loose.
And I was thinking...

1548
01:48:27,751 --> 01:48:30,669
...you know the case best.
- Yeah. That's true.

1549
01:48:30,837 --> 01:48:33,672
And you know all the players
and you have all the files.

1550
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:36,592
- Lost them.
- You lost them?

1551
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:40,221
Or I tossed them. I don't know.
I moved onto a boat.

1552
01:48:40,388 --> 01:48:43,474
You know that we work in
the daily business, right? As in, today?

1553
01:48:43,642 --> 01:48:45,935
What do you think
we were doing back then?

1554
01:48:47,646 --> 01:48:50,481
More people die in the East Bay commute
every three months...

1555
01:48:50,649 --> 01:48:52,149
...than that idiot ever killed.

1556
01:48:52,317 --> 01:48:56,612
He offed a few citizens and he wrote a
few letters and he faded into a footnote.

1557
01:49:02,536 --> 01:49:06,830
Not that I haven't been sitting here idly
waiting for you to drop by...

1558
01:49:06,998 --> 01:49:09,833
...and reinvigorate my sense of purpose.

1559
01:49:11,836 --> 01:49:14,463
It was four years ago. Let it fucking go.

1560
01:49:14,798 --> 01:49:17,925
You're wrong. It was important.

1561
01:49:19,094 --> 01:49:21,303
Then what did you ever do about it...

1562
01:49:22,347 --> 01:49:24,682
...if it was so important?
What did you ever do?

1563
01:49:24,849 --> 01:49:27,393
You hovered over my desk,
you stole from wastebaskets.

1564
01:49:27,561 --> 01:49:29,228
Am I being unkind?

1565
01:49:30,355 --> 01:49:34,608
Oh, that's right, I forgot.
You went to the library.

1566
01:49:36,528 --> 01:49:38,571
I'm sorry I bothered you.

1567
01:50:00,427 --> 01:50:02,553
- Hey, hi.
- Hi.

1568
01:50:02,721 --> 01:50:05,723
- Where you been?
- The library.

1569
01:50:36,838 --> 01:50:38,505
Thank you.

1570
01:50:53,897 --> 01:50:57,608
- Inspector Toschi?
- Yeah? One moment, please.

1571
01:51:01,613 --> 01:51:03,656
- Hi.
- Hi.

1572
01:51:04,366 --> 01:51:06,116
We met at the movies once.

1573
01:51:06,701 --> 01:51:09,078
- It must have been magical.
- I'm Robert Graysmith.

1574
01:51:09,245 --> 01:51:12,581
I work at the Chronicle.
I was wondering if I could buy you lunch.

1575
01:51:14,417 --> 01:51:15,668
Sure, why not?

1576
01:51:15,835 --> 01:51:18,754
So you're a friend of Paul Avery's?

1577
01:51:18,922 --> 01:51:21,215
He's actually the reason I'm here.

1578
01:51:22,801 --> 01:51:24,718
I wanted to ask you about Zodiac.

1579
01:51:25,595 --> 01:51:28,639
Well, I appreciate the interest,
but we don't discuss open cases.

1580
01:51:28,807 --> 01:51:31,100
Oh, well, what's going on with it,
day-to-day?

1581
01:51:31,267 --> 01:51:33,560
We're actively pursuing all leads.

1582
01:51:33,728 --> 01:51:36,689
And you're the only one on it, right?

1583
01:51:37,148 --> 01:51:38,857
Mr. Graysmith...

1584
01:51:39,442 --> 01:51:41,443
...Zodiac hasn't written in three years.

1585
01:51:41,611 --> 01:51:44,405
You know how many murders we've had
in San Francisco since?

1586
01:51:44,572 --> 01:51:46,073
- No.
- Over 200.

1587
01:51:46,241 --> 01:51:49,284
That's a lot of dead people
and grieving families that need help.

1588
01:51:49,452 --> 01:51:50,994
So nobody cares.

1589
01:51:51,162 --> 01:51:54,081
Excuse me? I care.

1590
01:51:56,418 --> 01:51:58,669
Okay. Can I show you something?

1591
01:52:01,589 --> 01:52:04,717
I've been doing research
on the first cipher.

1592
01:52:04,884 --> 01:52:09,847
Everything an amateur would need
to create it can be found in these books.

1593
01:52:10,014 --> 01:52:13,183
Now, I started thinking
that if you can track these books...

1594
01:52:13,351 --> 01:52:15,310
...then maybe you could track the man.

1595
01:52:16,187 --> 01:52:18,939
So I remember you thought
that Zodiac was military...

1596
01:52:19,107 --> 01:52:22,693
...so I went to every base library
and I got a list of every person...

1597
01:52:22,861 --> 01:52:26,864
...who's ever checked out these books
and that's when I found this.

1598
01:52:31,703 --> 01:52:34,204
- Missing.
- It means they were stolen.

1599
01:52:34,789 --> 01:52:38,500
So almost every book on ciphers
was stolen from the Presidio Library?

1600
01:52:38,668 --> 01:52:40,753
And the Oakland Army Terminal Library.

1601
01:52:44,048 --> 01:52:47,801
Somebody didn't want a record
of ever having checked out these books.

1602
01:52:48,636 --> 01:52:50,679
Who are you again?

1603
01:52:52,390 --> 01:52:54,433
I just wanna help.

1604
01:52:57,228 --> 01:52:59,229
I can't allow you to help.

1605
01:52:59,397 --> 01:53:02,524
I can't discuss the case with you.
I can't give you information...

1606
01:53:02,692 --> 01:53:06,445
...and I certainly couldn't tell you
to go see Ken Narlow in Napa.

1607
01:53:06,613 --> 01:53:07,946
N-A-R-L-O-W.

1608
01:53:17,999 --> 01:53:22,878
I'm sorry, Mr. Graysmith,
but we don't cooperate with writers.

1609
01:53:23,046 --> 01:53:25,422
Well, I'm not a writer, I'm a cartoonist.

1610
01:53:26,591 --> 01:53:28,759
- And Dave Toschi sent you?
- Yes.

1611
01:53:28,927 --> 01:53:30,636
- Why?
- Maybe he...

1612
01:53:30,804 --> 01:53:32,971
Maybe he thought
that I could do some good.

1613
01:53:34,390 --> 01:53:39,144
- What are you, some kind of boy scout?
- Eagle Scout, actually. First class.

1614
01:53:39,604 --> 01:53:42,564
Well, if you wanna do this,
don't let me stop you.

1615
01:53:43,858 --> 01:53:46,235
Better start with Vallejo, Jack Mulanax.

1616
01:53:46,986 --> 01:53:49,196
I understand what you're trying to do...

1617
01:53:49,364 --> 01:53:51,615
...but this is an open
police investigation.

1618
01:53:51,783 --> 01:53:53,951
I'm a friend of Dave Toschi's.

1619
01:53:54,118 --> 01:53:57,120
And he said
that you might be able to help.

1620
01:53:57,622 --> 01:54:01,208
I mean, the case is dead.
Zodiac's long gone.

1621
01:54:01,376 --> 01:54:03,627
He's yesterday's news, right?

1622
01:54:04,546 --> 01:54:06,338
That's what they say.

1623
01:54:07,131 --> 01:54:09,091
So, what's the harm?

1624
01:54:09,259 --> 01:54:10,801
No pens, no paper.

1625
01:54:10,969 --> 01:54:13,804
Anything that's relevant,
you better remember in your head.

1626
01:54:13,972 --> 01:54:15,305
Okay.

1627
01:54:17,308 --> 01:54:19,309
- Okay, here we go.
- Which one?

1628
01:54:19,477 --> 01:54:21,395
All of them.
There's more in the next room.

1629
01:54:21,563 --> 01:54:23,313
They're all marked with these numbers.

1630
01:54:23,481 --> 01:54:26,567
- "243-146."
- You don't smoke, do you?

1631
01:54:26,860 --> 01:54:29,903
Once. In high school.

1632
01:54:32,407 --> 01:54:33,907
Let me see this.

1633
01:54:34,701 --> 01:54:36,618
Thank you.

1634
01:55:04,063 --> 01:55:05,731
Man, you really creeped us out.

1635
01:55:11,905 --> 01:55:13,572
"Nine millimeter."

1636
01:55:15,700 --> 01:55:18,869
"Said nothing and began firing."

1637
01:55:33,885 --> 01:55:37,763
"Darlene's sister, Linda.
It was all just deep breathing. George."

1638
01:55:39,098 --> 01:55:41,308
"It was a strange man. George."

1639
01:55:43,186 --> 01:55:46,355
Thank you so much.

1640
01:55:46,522 --> 01:55:49,232
Oh, briefcase. Thanks.

1641
01:55:51,402 --> 01:55:53,695
- Hey, Jack.
- Hey, Bawart.

1642
01:55:53,863 --> 01:55:55,572
- Who's that?
- That's Graysmith.

1643
01:55:55,740 --> 01:55:59,117
Some cartoonist.
Thinks he's gonna solve the Zodiac.

1644
01:56:01,037 --> 01:56:02,079
Well, good for him.

1645
01:56:02,538 --> 01:56:05,165
Traffic troubles won't be affecting
very many commuters.

1646
01:56:05,333 --> 01:56:08,251
Highway 37, blocked
between Navarro and Vallejo.

1647
01:56:08,419 --> 01:56:11,672
A gasoline tanker truck
overturned tonight...

1648
01:56:32,777 --> 01:56:35,070
- Thank you for meeting me.
- No. We're not meeting.

1649
01:56:35,238 --> 01:56:37,531
We're just two guys
sitting on the same bench.

1650
01:56:37,699 --> 01:56:40,283
I've got five minutes.
I've gotta get back to the Hall.

1651
01:56:40,451 --> 01:56:43,620
As far as you know, did anyone
ever get in touch with Mageau...

1652
01:56:43,788 --> 01:56:46,415
...during your investigation
and show him suspect photos?

1653
01:56:46,582 --> 01:56:47,624
Why?

1654
01:56:47,792 --> 01:56:50,711
He's the only surviving victim
who saw Zodiac without a mask.

1655
01:56:50,878 --> 01:56:53,296
No, why are you asking me?
That's Vallejo's case.

1656
01:56:53,464 --> 01:56:55,924
Paul Stine is mine.
You've got four minutes now.

1657
01:56:56,092 --> 01:56:58,552
Look, Darlene Ferrin was being followed.

1658
01:56:58,720 --> 01:57:01,138
Mulanax says they found this guy,
a George Waters?

1659
01:57:01,305 --> 01:57:04,975
He also said a lot of admirers would come
to the restaurant where she worked.

1660
01:57:05,143 --> 01:57:06,810
- She was popular.
- Very.

1661
01:57:06,978 --> 01:57:09,980
Yeah, so she and her husband,
they move into their new house.

1662
01:57:10,148 --> 01:57:12,357
And one night,
they throw this painting party.

1663
01:57:12,525 --> 01:57:15,569
- What's a painting party?
- A party where people help you paint.

1664
01:57:15,737 --> 01:57:18,280
- Sounds like a terrible party.
- Well, supposedly...

1665
01:57:18,448 --> 01:57:20,657
...somebody who's not Waters
shows up.

1666
01:57:20,825 --> 01:57:22,492
And Darlene is terrified of him.

1667
01:57:22,660 --> 01:57:24,578
So you think that Darlene knew Zodiac?

1668
01:57:24,746 --> 01:57:28,915
And if Zodiac knew Darlene,
then maybe Mageau knows Zodiac.

1669
01:57:29,083 --> 01:57:30,792
Maybe. But Mageau's gone.

1670
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:34,337
If you wanna connect Darlene to Zodiac,
you'll have to find another way.

1671
01:57:34,505 --> 01:57:37,382
I have another way. Phone calls
the night of Darlene's murder.

1672
01:57:37,550 --> 01:57:40,677
- Yeah, Zodiac called the police.
- No, there were four other calls.

1673
01:57:40,845 --> 01:57:44,222
Two to Darlene's house, Darlene's
brother-in-law and father-in-law.

1674
01:57:44,390 --> 01:57:47,350
Just heavy breathing.
They started around 1:30 a.m.

1675
01:57:47,518 --> 01:57:51,063
And this was before anyone in the family
knew that Darlene had been shot.

1676
01:57:51,230 --> 01:57:53,315
- This was in the Vallejo files?
- Yeah.

1677
01:57:53,483 --> 01:57:55,609
- Goddamn it.
- It's more than just coincidence.

1678
01:57:55,777 --> 01:57:59,446
Somebody doesn't just randomly prank
phone call a victim's entire family...

1679
01:57:59,614 --> 01:58:01,448
...90 minutes after they were shot.

1680
01:58:01,616 --> 01:58:05,160
So either Zodiac shoots a random
couple, then he recognizes Darlene...

1681
01:58:05,328 --> 01:58:07,245
Or Darlene was shot on purpose.

1682
01:58:07,413 --> 01:58:11,166
Either way,
Zodiac had to have known Darlene.

1683
01:58:12,376 --> 01:58:14,711
That's good, Robert.

1684
01:58:14,879 --> 01:58:17,589
So I can't find Mageau,
maybe I can find Darlene's sister.

1685
01:58:17,757 --> 01:58:19,966
Maybe she can tell me
who this mystery man is.

1686
01:58:20,134 --> 01:58:23,303
Try that. I've got to go. She's very cute.

1687
01:58:26,724 --> 01:58:31,061
You know, it's interesting that you should
mention Zodiac calling people at home.

1688
01:58:31,229 --> 01:58:34,231
- He did that in San Francisco once.
- What? Who did he call?

1689
01:58:34,398 --> 01:58:37,901
I can't tell you.
That's privileged information.

1690
01:58:38,736 --> 01:58:40,946
But maybe Melvin Belli could.

1691
01:58:43,908 --> 01:58:48,036
Melvin Belli.
How do I get to Melvin Belli?

1692
01:58:48,621 --> 01:58:51,123
- He should be along soon.
- Oh, that's all right.

1693
01:58:51,290 --> 01:58:53,708
I've really only been waiting
two hours...

1694
01:58:53,876 --> 01:58:55,669
He's usually not this late.

1695
01:58:55,837 --> 01:58:59,089
Oh, cookies. Thank you.
These look great.

1696
01:58:59,257 --> 01:59:01,133
You are here on business?

1697
01:59:01,300 --> 01:59:03,343
I'm writing a book about the Zodiac.

1698
01:59:03,511 --> 01:59:06,096
I remember that. I spoke to him.

1699
01:59:06,264 --> 01:59:10,934
- You mean to Mr. Belli about the case?
- No, to the Zodiac when he called.

1700
01:59:11,102 --> 01:59:14,146
He said he had to kill
because it was his birthday.

1701
01:59:14,313 --> 01:59:17,399
He said it...
Wait, he said it was his birthday?

1702
01:59:17,567 --> 01:59:20,443
Yes. You want something to drink?

1703
01:59:21,779 --> 01:59:23,488
When was this?

1704
01:59:24,157 --> 01:59:26,449
So many years ago.

1705
01:59:26,993 --> 01:59:31,121
Mr. Belli was away for Christmas.
Gone for a week.

1706
01:59:31,289 --> 01:59:33,748
The Zodiac called,
wanting to talk to him.

1707
01:59:33,916 --> 01:59:35,250
I said, "He is not here."

1708
01:59:35,418 --> 01:59:38,003
He said, "I have to kill.
Today is my birthday."

1709
01:59:38,171 --> 01:59:40,213
And then he hangs up.

1710
01:59:40,381 --> 01:59:41,965
Then the letter arrived.

1711
01:59:42,133 --> 01:59:46,261
So the call came before the letter
of December 20th.

1712
01:59:46,429 --> 01:59:48,221
Mr. Belli was gone for a week?

1713
01:59:48,389 --> 01:59:52,058
He came back on Christmas.
Not a good day to work.

1714
01:59:52,226 --> 01:59:53,852
So he left on the 18th.

1715
01:59:55,313 --> 01:59:58,190
- Is that helpful?
- She said it was his birthday.

1716
01:59:58,357 --> 02:00:00,984
Well, you have to confirm that,
now wouldn't you?

1717
02:00:01,152 --> 02:00:03,612
How? How?

1718
02:00:03,779 --> 02:00:06,698
Well, I never spoke to her,
but maybe my partner did.

1719
02:00:06,866 --> 02:00:09,868
- How do I get ahold of him?
- You don't. Bill wanted out of this.

1720
02:00:10,036 --> 02:00:12,162
As far as I'm concerned,
he should stay out.

1721
02:00:12,330 --> 02:00:13,455
How do I confirm it?

1722
02:00:13,623 --> 02:00:16,249
Well, if my partner did
talk to someone from Justice...

1723
02:00:16,417 --> 02:00:19,920
...they would've had to put that in
a report. That's standard procedure.

1724
02:00:20,379 --> 02:00:22,339
- Okay.
- Mel Nicolai.

1725
02:00:22,506 --> 02:00:24,758
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

1726
02:00:24,926 --> 02:00:27,219
- I just need to confirm a date.
- Mr. Graysmith.

1727
02:00:27,386 --> 02:00:30,430
I've narrowed it down between
the 18th and the 20th of December...

1728
02:00:30,598 --> 02:00:33,934
Okay, I'll play.
Let's say this phone call did take place.

1729
02:00:34,101 --> 02:00:38,188
Let's say it really was Zodiac. Why would
he volunteer the day he was born?

1730
02:00:38,356 --> 02:00:40,190
Plus, nobody died on December 18th...

1731
02:00:40,358 --> 02:00:43,860
...like nobody died over the weekend
he was gonna kill a dozen people...

1732
02:00:44,028 --> 02:00:46,029
...or when he was gonna
shoot school kids.

1733
02:00:46,197 --> 02:00:49,032
- He's a liar, Mr. Graysmith.
- What if he made a mistake?

1734
02:00:49,367 --> 02:00:53,662
What if he wasn't lying, if it was him?
He didn't expect a nice person to pick up.

1735
02:00:53,829 --> 02:00:55,080
What if, what if, what if?

1736
02:00:55,248 --> 02:00:58,583
Look, off the record,
Bill Armstrong checked this out.

1737
02:00:58,751 --> 02:01:01,211
We took this very seriously.

1738
02:01:01,379 --> 02:01:04,506
None of the suspects had the same
birthday as this phantom caller.

1739
02:01:04,674 --> 02:01:07,008
Bill Armstrong.

1740
02:01:12,348 --> 02:01:16,434
Can I give you a piece of advice?
You're looking in the wrong place.

1741
02:01:16,602 --> 02:01:19,479
Handwriting, fingerprints,
that's what this thing's about.

1742
02:01:19,647 --> 02:01:20,897
Stick to the evidence.

1743
02:01:21,941 --> 02:01:23,400
Hey.

1744
02:01:31,284 --> 02:01:33,535
Hey. How was your day?

1745
02:01:33,703 --> 02:01:35,245
Long.

1746
02:01:39,750 --> 02:01:40,959
Who's Sherwood Morrill?

1747
02:01:41,127 --> 02:01:43,795
He's a handwriting expert
in Sacramento.

1748
02:01:43,963 --> 02:01:47,340
He called. He said he could meet you
tomorrow morning at 7.

1749
02:01:47,508 --> 02:01:48,842
Oh, great.

1750
02:01:49,010 --> 02:01:50,260
So you're taking off work?

1751
02:01:50,428 --> 02:01:52,554
Just an hour.

1752
02:01:53,389 --> 02:01:54,723
Sacramento's two hours away.

1753
02:01:56,809 --> 02:01:58,977
- Really?
- Yes.

1754
02:01:59,145 --> 02:02:00,645
What's this?

1755
02:02:00,813 --> 02:02:03,273
Oh, that's the... That article.

1756
02:02:03,441 --> 02:02:06,860
"Robert Graysmith has quietly been
shopping his book about the Zodiac."

1757
02:02:07,028 --> 02:02:08,194
Yeah.

1758
02:02:08,362 --> 02:02:12,574
- It talks all about you researching Zodiac.
- Well, that's what the article's about.

1759
02:02:12,742 --> 02:02:14,743
I'm not sure we want people
to know that.

1760
02:02:14,910 --> 02:02:16,077
Why, are you embarrassed?

1761
02:02:16,245 --> 02:02:19,122
Robert, what's the one thing
we know about Zodiac?

1762
02:02:20,207 --> 02:02:21,750
He reads the Chronicle?

1763
02:02:21,917 --> 02:02:24,711
Yeah, but he's never
gonna read Herb Caen.

1764
02:02:28,632 --> 02:02:30,800
- Hello.
- Mr. Graysmith?

1765
02:02:30,968 --> 02:02:33,470
The Robert Graysmith
mentioned in the paper today?

1766
02:02:33,637 --> 02:02:34,804
Yeah?

1767
02:02:34,972 --> 02:02:37,807
I can tell you who the Zodiac is.

1768
02:02:40,519 --> 02:02:41,561
Who is this?

1769
02:02:41,729 --> 02:02:43,772
The Zodiac Killer
is obsessed with movies.

1770
02:02:43,939 --> 02:02:46,524
He recorded his murders on film.

1771
02:02:46,692 --> 02:02:49,861
I tried to tell the police,
but they wouldn't follow through on it.

1772
02:02:50,029 --> 02:02:53,448
There's a man you need to find.
His name is Bob Vaughn.

1773
02:02:53,616 --> 02:02:55,909
- Pen, pen.
- V-A-U-G-H-N.

1774
02:02:56,077 --> 02:02:57,911
He's a friend of the Zodiac's.

1775
02:02:58,079 --> 02:03:00,413
Mr. Vaughn does not know
his friend is a killer...

1776
02:03:00,581 --> 02:03:02,916
...and he's storing some film canisters
for him.

1777
02:03:03,084 --> 02:03:05,001
In these canisters is the evidence.

1778
02:03:05,169 --> 02:03:08,338
Okay, yeah, friend? Who's his friend?

1779
02:03:08,506 --> 02:03:11,674
- You have quite enough to get started.
- Oh, please.

1780
02:03:11,842 --> 02:03:16,179
The Zodiac's name is Rick Marshall.

1781
02:03:18,849 --> 02:03:21,059
Your toast is burning.

1782
02:03:22,019 --> 02:03:27,565
We choose at some point in our lives
how to physically construct each letter.

1783
02:03:27,733 --> 02:03:29,859
Once we lock that into our brains...

1784
02:03:30,027 --> 02:03:32,362
...our handwriting may change
over the years...

1785
02:03:32,530 --> 02:03:35,907
...but the moves themselves
remain unaltered. Understand?

1786
02:03:36,075 --> 02:03:37,534
Yes.

1787
02:03:38,244 --> 02:03:40,829
Except Zodiac's doesn't.

1788
02:03:42,039 --> 02:03:44,374
Specifically with his K.

1789
02:03:45,042 --> 02:03:47,794
In his first letters,
he executed the K with two strokes.

1790
02:03:47,962 --> 02:03:50,755
- Later letters, he did them with three.
- Why?

1791
02:03:50,923 --> 02:03:53,800
We don't know.
Excuse me, I gotta spray this.

1792
02:03:53,968 --> 02:03:57,053
How many suspects were cleared
through handwriting?

1793
02:03:57,221 --> 02:04:02,100
All of them. Also the print in the cab.
No match was ever found.

1794
02:04:02,268 --> 02:04:06,312
Is there any way that someone
could beat a handwriting test?

1795
02:04:06,480 --> 02:04:11,234
No. Whoever the Zodiac is,
he's not someone I cleared.

1796
02:04:11,819 --> 02:04:15,280
About a month ago, a man showed up
on my doorstep very distraught.

1797
02:04:15,573 --> 02:04:18,074
Name was Wallace Penny.

1798
02:04:18,242 --> 02:04:22,579
He said he knew who the Zodiac was.
Gave me a name.

1799
02:04:22,746 --> 02:04:25,457
- Rick, Rick somebody.
- Rick Marshall?

1800
02:04:26,917 --> 02:04:29,919
- Yeah.
- The man you talked to called me too.

1801
02:04:30,087 --> 02:04:34,716
After he left, then I checked my files.
I never cleared a Rick Marshall.

1802
02:04:41,849 --> 02:04:43,349
Hello?

1803
02:04:48,105 --> 02:04:49,939
Hello. Who is this?

1804
02:04:59,825 --> 02:05:01,618
It's a wrong number.

1805
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:11,002
Does the name Rick Marshall
mean anything to you?

1806
02:05:12,004 --> 02:05:15,215
- What are you after?
- What do you got?

1807
02:05:15,382 --> 02:05:20,220
Hypothetically, you just named
my favorite suspect in the whole case.

1808
02:05:20,763 --> 02:05:24,599
This is off the record. Couple years back,
I was trying to get Marshall's prints.

1809
02:05:24,767 --> 02:05:26,976
I handed him a photo.
He looks at it.

1810
02:05:27,144 --> 02:05:28,978
He's about to give it back
and he says:

1811
02:05:29,146 --> 02:05:31,564
"My goodness,
I got fingerprints all over this."

1812
02:05:31,732 --> 02:05:34,067
And he wipes them off.

1813
02:05:34,235 --> 02:05:36,110
Why didn't you test him for handwriting?

1814
02:05:36,278 --> 02:05:38,530
Because when they finally did
run his prints...

1815
02:05:38,697 --> 02:05:41,115
...they cleared him
against the one in Stine's cab.

1816
02:05:41,283 --> 02:05:43,159
- So it's not him.
- Maybe yes, maybe no.

1817
02:05:43,327 --> 02:05:45,370
No. What do you mean?

1818
02:05:45,538 --> 02:05:47,622
Zodiac left gloves behind at the scene.

1819
02:05:47,790 --> 02:05:49,791
If he had the foresight
to bring gloves...

1820
02:05:49,959 --> 02:05:52,460
...how's he gonna accidentally
leave a print behind?

1821
02:05:52,628 --> 02:05:54,212
But it was in the victim's blood.

1822
02:05:54,380 --> 02:05:58,383
Could have been one of the bystanders
or a cop just reaches out... false print.

1823
02:05:58,551 --> 02:06:00,677
But that print disqualified 2500 suspects.

1824
02:06:00,844 --> 02:06:03,596
- Which is why we used handwriting.
- But not for Marshall.

1825
02:06:03,764 --> 02:06:06,599
S.F.P.D. saw a handwritten sign
in the window of his house...

1826
02:06:06,767 --> 02:06:09,894
...decided it looked nothing like
the Z letters, so they moved on.

1827
02:06:10,062 --> 02:06:12,564
How do they know
that Rick Marshall wrote the sign?

1828
02:06:12,731 --> 02:06:14,983
My thoughts exactly.

1829
02:06:15,150 --> 02:06:17,235
Rick Marshall was a Navy man.

1830
02:06:17,403 --> 02:06:21,364
He received code training. He was also
a projectionist at a silent-film theater.

1831
02:06:21,532 --> 02:06:23,700
How do I get copies
of Marshall's handwriting?

1832
02:06:23,867 --> 02:06:28,580
Three ways. One, get a warrant, which
you can't. Two, get him to volunteer...

1833
02:06:28,747 --> 02:06:30,415
...which he won't.
- Yeah, and three?

1834
02:06:31,875 --> 02:06:33,626
Get creative.

1835
02:06:33,794 --> 02:06:36,546
I don't know what to tell you.
You get it, I'll analyze it.

1836
02:06:36,714 --> 02:06:40,300
- Beyond that, you're on your own.
- What about the guy who saw you?

1837
02:06:40,467 --> 02:06:41,801
The one who called me?

1838
02:06:41,969 --> 02:06:44,470
You mean Wallace Penny?

1839
02:06:44,638 --> 02:06:46,973
Yeah. Did he leave a number?

1840
02:06:55,858 --> 02:06:59,235
- Hello?
- Hi, this is Robert Graysmith.

1841
02:06:59,403 --> 02:07:02,488
- How did you find me?
- I need a sample of Marshall's writing.

1842
02:07:02,656 --> 02:07:03,990
I told you. Vaughn is who...

1843
02:07:04,158 --> 02:07:06,826
Mr. Penny,
if Rick Marshall is the Zodiac...

1844
02:07:06,994 --> 02:07:09,495
...I need a sample
of his handwriting to confirm it.

1845
02:07:09,663 --> 02:07:11,789
Can you help me or not?

1846
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:17,503
Rick used to draw movie posters
for the theater Vaughn worked at.

1847
02:07:17,755 --> 02:07:19,631
- I'll send one down.
- Thank you.

1848
02:07:29,683 --> 02:07:30,767
I'll need more samples.

1849
02:07:30,934 --> 02:07:33,436
- Yeah, but is it...?
- It's as close as I've ever seen.

1850
02:07:33,604 --> 02:07:37,231
Tread lightly here. We're talking about
implicating this man as the Zodiac.

1851
02:07:37,399 --> 02:07:40,360
I can get more. I'll just find Vaughn
and I'll track down Linda.

1852
02:07:40,527 --> 02:07:43,905
I mean, Linda is Darlene's sister.
I've been to the DMV...

1853
02:07:44,073 --> 02:07:48,284
...and I talked to her parents, but still,
nobody knows where to find her.

1854
02:07:48,452 --> 02:07:52,914
Mr. Graysmith, most of the writing
matches the exemplar.

1855
02:07:53,082 --> 02:07:56,125
Though it's the part that doesn't match
that scares me the most.

1856
02:07:56,293 --> 02:07:58,378
- What do you mean?
- Well, on the poster...

1857
02:07:58,545 --> 02:08:01,881
...the one letter that absolutely,
positively does not match...

1858
02:08:02,049 --> 02:08:03,883
...is the letter K.

1859
02:08:05,469 --> 02:08:08,805
You wouldn't happen to have any
Animal Crackers in there, would you?

1860
02:08:09,640 --> 02:08:13,434
Unit 5, Toschi needs to call in
on a landline.

1861
02:08:24,988 --> 02:08:27,323
- Dispatch.
- Hey. Dave Toschi.

1862
02:08:27,491 --> 02:08:29,242
I'll connect you.

1863
02:08:29,827 --> 02:08:31,411
- Dave?
- Yeah. What's up?

1864
02:08:31,578 --> 02:08:33,496
Jennings here from the Chronicle.

1865
02:08:33,664 --> 02:08:35,790
It came in this morning.
You need to see it.

1866
02:08:35,958 --> 02:08:36,999
See what?

1867
02:08:37,167 --> 02:08:39,752
The new Zodiac letter.
And it mentions you.

1868
02:08:39,920 --> 02:08:41,879
Okay, okay.

1869
02:08:43,173 --> 02:08:47,427
Shit. All right, come on. Hall of Justice.

1870
02:08:47,678 --> 02:08:51,639
Now. Come on, come on, come on.

1871
02:08:57,104 --> 02:08:58,354
Dave.

1872
02:08:58,939 --> 02:09:00,982
Do you have it with you?

1873
02:09:04,528 --> 02:09:06,863
"This is the Zodiac speaking.
I'm back with you.

1874
02:09:07,030 --> 02:09:09,949
Tell Herb Caen I am here,
I have always been here.

1875
02:09:10,117 --> 02:09:12,952
That city pig Toschi is good,
but I am smarter and better.

1876
02:09:13,120 --> 02:09:16,122
He will get tired, then leave me alone.

1877
02:09:16,290 --> 02:09:18,958
I'm waiting for a good movie about me.
Who will play me?

1878
02:09:19,126 --> 02:09:21,586
I'm now in control of all things."

1879
02:09:21,754 --> 02:09:24,338
These guys are from Internal Affairs.

1880
02:09:26,133 --> 02:09:28,009
We need to talk.

1881
02:09:28,177 --> 02:09:29,510
Good evening. Our top story:

1882
02:09:29,678 --> 02:09:32,096
The San Francisco Police Department
has confirmed...

1883
02:09:32,264 --> 02:09:36,350
...that the man who calls himself Zodiac
and terrorized the Bay Area...

1884
02:09:36,518 --> 02:09:39,187
...has broken his silence of 51 months.

1885
02:09:39,354 --> 02:09:41,898
In a letter claiming,
"I am back with you"...

1886
02:09:42,065 --> 02:09:45,818
...the Zodiac makes no overt threats
against the citizenry...

1887
02:09:45,986 --> 02:09:48,654
...and muses that his life
would make the best movie yet.

1888
02:09:48,822 --> 02:09:50,907
These carrots are perfect.

1889
02:09:51,492 --> 02:09:53,326
- Just go.
- This message also mentions...

1890
02:09:53,494 --> 02:09:55,912
...San Francisco Chronicle
columnist Herb Caen...

1891
02:09:56,079 --> 02:09:58,915
...and the department's
own David Toschi by name.

1892
02:09:59,082 --> 02:10:00,124
May I be excused?

1893
02:10:00,292 --> 02:10:03,044
You have to come back
and finish what's on that plate.

1894
02:10:03,212 --> 02:10:05,880
Our team's coverage
on the cipher slayer's return...

1895
02:10:06,048 --> 02:10:08,508
...begins as Alan Freeman has more.

1896
02:10:08,675 --> 02:10:11,928
Thank you, Eric. Chronicle columnist
Armistead Maupin said...

1897
02:10:12,095 --> 02:10:14,931
...that he thinks not only
is this new letter a forgery...

1898
02:10:15,098 --> 02:10:19,268
...but it was written by the very man
trusted to hunt down this killer...

1899
02:10:19,436 --> 02:10:22,897
...David Toschi. Maupin,
a very well-respected author...

1900
02:10:23,065 --> 02:10:27,193
...has gone on record saying that
he believes Toschi wrote the letter...

1901
02:10:27,361 --> 02:10:29,278
...to drum up publicity for himself.

1902
02:10:29,446 --> 02:10:32,532
Maupin used David
as a character in his column.

1903
02:10:32,699 --> 02:10:36,035
David got a kick out of it and wrote
a couple of anonymous letters...

1904
02:10:36,203 --> 02:10:38,371
...asking for the character
to be brought back.

1905
02:10:38,539 --> 02:10:41,707
It was like writing fan mail to himself.
That's all.

1906
02:10:41,875 --> 02:10:44,043
But David did not write that letter.

1907
02:10:44,211 --> 02:10:47,213
No, I'm sure that he didn't.
I'm sure this will all blow over.

1908
02:10:47,381 --> 02:10:48,548
"Blow over"?

1909
02:10:48,715 --> 02:10:50,800
They kicked him out of Homicide.

1910
02:10:50,968 --> 02:10:54,220
They made him give his handwriting
like some common criminal.

1911
02:10:54,388 --> 02:10:57,765
- May I talk to him?
- No.

1912
02:10:57,933 --> 02:11:01,269
Can you just ask him if he ever
investigated a man named Rick Marshall?

1913
02:11:01,436 --> 02:11:03,437
Is that all you can think about?

1914
02:11:03,605 --> 02:11:07,191
Mr. Graysmith,
Maupin works at your paper. We trust...

1915
02:11:12,865 --> 02:11:16,617
- This girl, she wants music lessons?
- Dave. Dave.

1916
02:11:17,911 --> 02:11:20,246
- Okay, see you later.
- I'll catch up to you.

1917
02:11:20,414 --> 02:11:22,582
You stop calling my house.
Do you understand me?

1918
02:11:22,749 --> 02:11:24,375
I need your help to find Linda.

1919
02:11:24,543 --> 02:11:27,253
- Jesus.
- Look, two seconds.

1920
02:11:28,589 --> 02:11:31,007
Look, we've been running
handwriting samples.

1921
02:11:31,174 --> 02:11:33,301
- Who's we?
- Sherwood and I.

1922
02:11:33,468 --> 02:11:36,679
Sherwood? Sherwood who was fired
from Questioned Documents?

1923
02:11:36,847 --> 02:11:39,473
- Sherwood who drinks like Paul Avery?
- He retired.

1924
02:11:39,641 --> 02:11:41,142
Is that what he told you?

1925
02:11:41,310 --> 02:11:45,271
- What, are you saying he's wrong?
- I'm saying stop calling my house.

1926
02:11:46,023 --> 02:11:47,857
- We ran them on Marshall.
- No, Robert.

1927
02:11:48,025 --> 02:11:51,652
- No, I know you don't think it's him.
- I am not having this conversation.

1928
02:11:51,820 --> 02:11:54,071
And I can't talk to Mageau or Linda,
so I'm...

1929
02:11:54,239 --> 02:11:55,781
- Robert, stop it.
- What? What?

1930
02:11:55,949 --> 02:11:59,619
The Rick Marshalls of this world
will suck you dry. They're blind alleys.

1931
02:11:59,786 --> 02:12:02,788
But he said he wasn't gonna
announce his murders anymore, Dave.

1932
02:12:02,956 --> 02:12:05,833
Do you know what the chances of us
arresting someone are now?

1933
02:12:06,001 --> 02:12:10,004
Too much time has gone by, okay?
Too much of the evidence is lost.

1934
02:12:10,172 --> 02:12:13,049
People get old, Robert. They forget.

1935
02:12:13,467 --> 02:12:17,511
Now, I have been a cop for 25 years.
Murder police for 12.

1936
02:12:17,679 --> 02:12:19,472
- What do you do?
- You know what I do.

1937
02:12:19,640 --> 02:12:22,224
- You're a cartoonist.
- So, what are you saying?

1938
02:12:22,392 --> 02:12:26,520
I am saying Zodiac was my job.
It is not yours.

1939
02:12:28,732 --> 02:12:31,150
- He's still out there.
- No, I am through with this.

1940
02:12:31,318 --> 02:12:33,402
I am through with you.

1941
02:12:39,493 --> 02:12:42,161
What about September 26, 1970?

1942
02:12:42,329 --> 02:12:46,332
- Okay, which one was that?
- "Lake Tahoe Nurse Goes Missing."

1943
02:12:48,585 --> 02:12:51,963
- One day before the vernal equinox. Dad?
- Yeah. Mark that.

1944
02:12:52,130 --> 02:12:55,466
Oh, got another one. June 19th, 1971.

1945
02:12:55,634 --> 02:12:58,761
That's gotta be
near the summer solstice.

1946
02:13:00,889 --> 02:13:05,393
Oh, guys. Don't tell Mom
about our special project, okay?

1947
02:13:06,019 --> 02:13:09,397
How come you and Mom
don't sleep in the same bed anymore?

1948
02:13:13,568 --> 02:13:16,195
- Hello?
- Mr. Graysmith, Ken Narlow from Napa.

1949
02:13:16,363 --> 02:13:20,366
Oh, Captain Narlow.
Thank you for calling me back.

1950
02:13:20,534 --> 02:13:22,201
Yeah. How can I help?

1951
02:13:22,369 --> 02:13:25,246
I called because we've been
cross-referencing lunar cycles...

1952
02:13:25,414 --> 02:13:26,914
...with the Zodiac's timeline.

1953
02:13:27,082 --> 02:13:30,626
More often than not, each cycle
since '69 corresponds with an attack...

1954
02:13:30,794 --> 02:13:34,046
...or with one of the letters
or an unsolved homicide.

1955
02:13:34,214 --> 02:13:37,091
- Who's working with you on this?
- Some colleagues.

1956
02:13:37,259 --> 02:13:38,467
Dad?

1957
02:13:39,428 --> 02:13:41,846
- Ken, can you hold on one second?
- Dad?

1958
02:13:42,305 --> 02:13:44,306
- What is it?
- What's this?

1959
02:13:48,061 --> 02:13:51,272
In the decade since the Zodiac's
last cipher was received...

1960
02:13:51,440 --> 02:13:54,608
...every federal agency
has taken a crack at decoding it.

1961
02:13:56,194 --> 02:14:00,156
But today, where those agencies
had failed, a cartoonist has succeeded.

1962
02:14:00,323 --> 02:14:02,616
How did you do it?

1963
02:14:02,784 --> 02:14:05,870
Just a lot of books from the library...

1964
02:14:06,038 --> 02:14:09,707
...and I love puzzles, so I just...

1965
02:14:09,875 --> 02:14:12,084
Yeah. The fucking library.

1966
02:14:12,252 --> 02:14:15,087
I believe you can accomplish anything
that you put your mind...

1967
02:14:17,924 --> 02:14:21,719
That's a J? Okay. Honor Camp?

1968
02:14:22,512 --> 02:14:24,388
Thank you so much.

1969
02:14:25,932 --> 02:14:28,684
Hey, we found Linda.
She's in jail. Isn't that great?

1970
02:14:28,852 --> 02:14:30,853
- Why'd you do it?
- She'll identify Rick...

1971
02:14:31,021 --> 02:14:34,356
- What are you talking about?
- You went on TV.

1972
02:14:34,524 --> 02:14:36,525
You put yourself out there
for him to see.

1973
02:14:36,693 --> 02:14:37,777
You're being paranoid.

1974
02:14:37,944 --> 02:14:40,946
Then who's been calling our house
in the middle of the night?

1975
02:14:41,114 --> 02:14:43,240
Nobody, I...

1976
02:14:44,034 --> 02:14:47,203
- What's it gonna take for you to be done?
- I can't talk about this.

1977
02:14:47,370 --> 02:14:48,704
I have to go see Bob Vaughn.

1978
02:14:48,872 --> 02:14:51,999
Well, that's too bad,
because we're gonna talk about this.

1979
02:14:52,167 --> 02:14:56,337
When is it gonna be finished? When
you catch him, when you arrest him?

1980
02:14:56,505 --> 02:14:58,964
- Be serious.
- I am serious.

1981
02:15:00,926 --> 02:15:05,262
I need to know who he is.

1982
02:15:05,889 --> 02:15:09,517
I need to stand there.
I need to look him in the eye...

1983
02:15:09,684 --> 02:15:12,645
...and I need to know that it's him.

1984
02:15:13,271 --> 02:15:15,648
Is that more important
than your family's safety?

1985
02:15:15,816 --> 02:15:17,942
Of course not.

1986
02:15:19,319 --> 02:15:22,279
Why? Why do you need to do this?

1987
02:15:23,323 --> 02:15:24,740
Why?

1988
02:15:26,576 --> 02:15:28,244
Because nobody else will.

1989
02:15:28,411 --> 02:15:29,912
That's not good enough.

1990
02:15:30,705 --> 02:15:32,206
Are you done? Can I go?

1991
02:15:47,973 --> 02:15:50,015
- Mr. Vaughn?
- Mr. Graysmith?

1992
02:15:50,183 --> 02:15:52,518
- Yes.
- Hi. You needed to speak to me?

1993
02:15:52,686 --> 02:15:54,937
Yes. There's a coffee shop
right on the corner.

1994
02:15:55,105 --> 02:15:58,190
- Why don't we just go to my home?
- Oh, I don't wanna put you out.

1995
02:15:58,358 --> 02:16:01,110
It's no trouble at all.
Where are you parked?

1996
02:16:01,278 --> 02:16:02,361
Just right there.

1997
02:16:02,529 --> 02:16:04,196
You can follow me?

1998
02:16:05,699 --> 02:16:06,949
Okay.

1999
02:16:24,759 --> 02:16:26,427
Watch your step.

2000
02:16:30,974 --> 02:16:34,226
- Very nice house.
- Oh, thank you.

2001
02:16:34,394 --> 02:16:36,145
It's very rustic.

2002
02:16:36,313 --> 02:16:39,231
- Can I take your jacket?
- No, thank you, I'm fine.

2003
02:16:39,399 --> 02:16:42,318
Okay. This way, please.

2004
02:16:44,321 --> 02:16:45,988
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

2005
02:16:46,156 --> 02:16:48,574
- How about some tea?
- Oh, no, I'm all right.

2006
02:16:48,742 --> 02:16:50,993
- You sure?
- Yes.

2007
02:16:51,161 --> 02:16:54,830
I wanted to ask you about a film
that the Avenue may have played...

2008
02:16:54,998 --> 02:16:59,126
...while you were the organist there,
The Most Dangerous Game?

2009
02:16:59,294 --> 02:17:02,588
It's a classic. RKO. 1932.

2010
02:17:02,756 --> 02:17:07,301
Fay Wray, Joel McCrea, Leslie Banks.
We've run that picture many times.

2011
02:17:07,469 --> 02:17:09,178
In '68, '69?

2012
02:17:10,764 --> 02:17:12,723
I'd have to check my records. Why?

2013
02:17:12,891 --> 02:17:14,808
Do you remember the Zodiac?

2014
02:17:17,270 --> 02:17:19,521
This is about Rick Marshall, isn't it?

2015
02:17:19,689 --> 02:17:23,442
- He was a projectionist there, right?
- For a time, yes.

2016
02:17:23,610 --> 02:17:27,363
But I have no occasion
to correspond with him these days.

2017
02:17:27,530 --> 02:17:29,782
Okay, well, there is a connection...

2018
02:17:29,950 --> 02:17:32,534
...between one of the Zodiac attacks
and that film.

2019
02:17:32,702 --> 02:17:34,453
You mean the symbol?

2020
02:17:35,830 --> 02:17:37,539
Hold on.

2021
02:17:37,707 --> 02:17:42,711
The Zodiac symbol on film.
It's on the countdown.

2022
02:17:45,548 --> 02:17:48,259
It's trimmed off each reel
before it's shown...

2023
02:17:48,426 --> 02:17:50,469
...but it always arrives with it.

2024
02:17:50,637 --> 02:17:52,638
Right there.

2025
02:17:53,139 --> 02:17:56,934
The first time I saw it in the papers,
I thought about that.

2026
02:17:57,435 --> 02:17:58,560
We got a tip...

2027
02:17:58,728 --> 02:18:03,148
...that Rick left a film canister here
that he told you never to open.

2028
02:18:03,316 --> 02:18:06,151
Tip about a mysterious film canister?

2029
02:18:07,153 --> 02:18:08,654
Is it true?

2030
02:18:10,407 --> 02:18:11,615
Yes.

2031
02:18:12,075 --> 02:18:14,535
- Did you open it?
- No.

2032
02:18:14,703 --> 02:18:20,249
- May I see it?
- Rick took it back in 1972.

2033
02:18:20,834 --> 02:18:25,421
This tip is how you got it in your head
that Rick is the Zodiac?

2034
02:18:25,588 --> 02:18:27,172
That and the poster.

2035
02:18:27,340 --> 02:18:29,550
The poster?

2036
02:18:30,677 --> 02:18:32,261
The poster that Rick drew.

2037
02:18:32,429 --> 02:18:35,431
The handwriting is the closest
that we have ever come to a match.

2038
02:18:35,598 --> 02:18:37,433
Rick didn't draw any posters.

2039
02:18:37,600 --> 02:18:39,059
No, he drew this one.

2040
02:18:39,227 --> 02:18:43,564
Mr. Graysmith, I do the posters myself.

2041
02:18:43,732 --> 02:18:46,108
That's my handwriting.

2042
02:18:54,117 --> 02:18:56,994
I won't take any more of your time.

2043
02:18:57,162 --> 02:19:02,499
Why don't I just go and find out
when we played that film?

2044
02:19:02,667 --> 02:19:04,043
Oh, that's all right.

2045
02:19:04,210 --> 02:19:08,297
It's not a problem.
They're just down in the basement.

2046
02:19:09,382 --> 02:19:12,468
Not many people
have basements in California.

2047
02:19:15,138 --> 02:19:16,638
I do.

2048
02:19:18,141 --> 02:19:20,476
Coming, Mr. Graysmith?

2049
02:19:31,654 --> 02:19:36,241
The original studio one-sheets
I always kept for myself.

2050
02:19:37,202 --> 02:19:40,245
The cheapo knockoffs
like you brought today...

2051
02:19:40,413 --> 02:19:42,873
...I end up tossing into the back alley.

2052
02:19:57,263 --> 02:19:59,431
'69.

2053
02:20:04,729 --> 02:20:05,854
You live alone?

2054
02:20:06,022 --> 02:20:11,944
Most Dangerous Game ran in May '69.

2055
02:20:12,112 --> 02:20:18,450
So that would be about nine weeks
before the first Zodiac letter, correct?

2056
02:20:21,454 --> 02:20:23,122
Yeah.

2057
02:20:26,918 --> 02:20:31,004
Do you think he saw the film
in our theater and was inspired?

2058
02:20:37,303 --> 02:20:39,763
Are you sure there's nobody else
in the house?

2059
02:20:41,724 --> 02:20:43,934
Would you like to go upstairs and check?

2060
02:20:45,186 --> 02:20:46,895
No.

2061
02:20:49,315 --> 02:20:52,693
Thank you. Thanks for everything.

2062
02:20:52,861 --> 02:20:54,570
You're welcome.

2063
02:21:15,633 --> 02:21:17,301
It's locked.

2064
02:21:27,812 --> 02:21:29,104
Thank you.

2065
02:21:32,192 --> 02:21:34,860
Good night, Mr. Graysmith.

2066
02:21:55,131 --> 02:21:59,801
Gotta be two killers.
One has the map, the other one kills...

2067
02:22:05,808 --> 02:22:07,309
Guys?

2068
02:22:40,635 --> 02:22:42,803
You've got five minutes.

2069
02:22:50,520 --> 02:22:52,187
Linda?

2070
02:22:52,730 --> 02:22:54,648
Hi, I'm Robert.

2071
02:22:58,403 --> 02:23:00,696
Did you get my note?

2072
02:23:00,863 --> 02:23:02,906
- What's this about?
- Zodiac.

2073
02:23:04,534 --> 02:23:06,285
Figures.

2074
02:23:06,911 --> 02:23:09,413
- You got the look.
- What look?

2075
02:23:10,039 --> 02:23:12,374
I didn't mean anything.

2076
02:23:13,251 --> 02:23:15,961
Tell me about this painting party.

2077
02:23:16,588 --> 02:23:19,673
I told the cops about that so long ago.

2078
02:23:22,719 --> 02:23:26,471
Darlene always had a lot of boys around,
even though she was married.

2079
02:23:26,639 --> 02:23:29,349
And this one guy was weird, though.

2080
02:23:29,517 --> 02:23:33,353
He used to bring her presents
from Tijuana and...

2081
02:23:33,521 --> 02:23:36,106
I don't know why
she was friends with him.

2082
02:23:36,274 --> 02:23:38,525
But she once told me
he'd killed somebody.

2083
02:23:38,693 --> 02:23:40,068
Really?

2084
02:23:40,236 --> 02:23:42,571
Yeah, I think maybe
when he was in the service.

2085
02:23:42,739 --> 02:23:44,698
- Navy?
- I think so.

2086
02:23:44,866 --> 02:23:46,867
Was he into movies?
Was he a movie buff?

2087
02:23:47,035 --> 02:23:49,494
I can tell you
that he was not into people.

2088
02:23:49,662 --> 02:23:52,748
The party Darlene threw,
people were supposed to just show up...

2089
02:23:52,915 --> 02:23:54,416
...and drink beer, help paint.

2090
02:23:54,584 --> 02:23:56,585
But this guy showed up in a suit...

2091
02:23:56,753 --> 02:23:59,588
...and just sat in a chair all by himself
all night long.

2092
02:23:59,756 --> 02:24:01,340
Didn't talk to anyone.

2093
02:24:01,507 --> 02:24:05,260
And Darlene told me to stay away
from him. She was scared of him.

2094
02:24:07,597 --> 02:24:09,806
Couple weeks later, she was dead.

2095
02:24:09,974 --> 02:24:12,643
I'm sorry. Do you remember his name?

2096
02:24:13,519 --> 02:24:17,189
I mean, it was short, like a nickname.
Like Stan.

2097
02:24:17,440 --> 02:24:20,442
- Rick?
- No, I don't think so.

2098
02:24:20,610 --> 02:24:22,736
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

2099
02:24:22,904 --> 02:24:25,405
How can you be sure?
It was long ago. Think hard.

2100
02:24:25,573 --> 02:24:26,948
I am thinking hard.

2101
02:24:27,659 --> 02:24:29,785
It was Rick.

2102
02:24:29,952 --> 02:24:32,913
- No, it wasn't.
- It was Rick. It was Rick Marshall.

2103
02:24:33,081 --> 02:24:35,457
- No.
- Just say it.

2104
02:24:35,625 --> 02:24:38,460
It wasn't Rick.

2105
02:24:50,098 --> 02:24:51,431
It was Leigh.

2106
02:24:54,727 --> 02:24:57,896
- Leigh?
- Yeah, Leigh.

2107
02:24:58,564 --> 02:24:59,898
Sounds right.

2108
02:25:04,612 --> 02:25:05,946
Officer!

2109
02:25:06,114 --> 02:25:08,532
- I need you to let me in.
- Is this an emergency?

2110
02:25:08,700 --> 02:25:10,283
No, I just need to see one file.

2111
02:25:10,451 --> 02:25:13,662
You need to come back tomorrow
morning, 8 a.m., when we're open.

2112
02:25:13,830 --> 02:25:15,455
Sergeant! Sergeant Mulanax!

2113
02:25:15,623 --> 02:25:18,959
Sergeant, I just need to see one file!
Just give me five minutes.

2114
02:25:19,127 --> 02:25:21,378
I know exactly where it is.

2115
02:25:22,547 --> 02:25:24,005
Please.

2116
02:25:37,061 --> 02:25:38,812
I shouldn't be talking to you.

2117
02:25:38,980 --> 02:25:41,273
- You got five minutes.
- Okay.

2118
02:25:43,067 --> 02:25:44,401
Here. Here.

2119
02:25:44,569 --> 02:25:48,155
Linda states that some of Darlene's
closest friends are Leigh...

2120
02:25:48,322 --> 02:25:51,283
...who used to bring Darlene
presents from Tijuana.

2121
02:25:51,451 --> 02:25:53,160
- So what?
- He knew her.

2122
02:25:53,327 --> 02:25:54,995
Linda said Leigh. This is Leigh.

2123
02:25:55,163 --> 02:25:59,166
No. That's just one name in a file
that contains hundreds. It's nothing.

2124
02:25:59,625 --> 02:26:02,586
- Dave Toschi...
- Agrees with me.

2125
02:26:02,754 --> 02:26:05,756
Our investigation into this subject
is over.

2126
02:26:08,551 --> 02:26:10,051
I'm sorry.

2127
02:26:18,978 --> 02:26:20,479
Hello.

2128
02:26:35,286 --> 02:26:36,620
Who's there?

2129
02:26:40,166 --> 02:26:42,834
- You didn't return my calls.
- I've been kind of busy.

2130
02:26:43,753 --> 02:26:46,213
Yeah. I can see that.

2131
02:26:47,840 --> 02:26:49,341
How's the book coming?

2132
02:26:52,678 --> 02:26:55,138
I tried to send you these.

2133
02:26:55,723 --> 02:26:57,516
I called the Chron.

2134
02:26:57,683 --> 02:27:02,020
Well, I'm not a cartoonist anymore,
so...

2135
02:27:02,188 --> 02:27:03,855
Yeah, I heard.

2136
02:27:08,444 --> 02:27:10,779
When's the last time you ate something?

2137
02:27:13,616 --> 02:27:15,325
Nothing makes sense anymore.

2138
02:27:18,329 --> 02:27:19,830
Did it ever?

2139
02:27:19,997 --> 02:27:22,082
Yeah, it did.

2140
02:27:22,250 --> 02:27:24,626
Robert, it was just the date
that didn't end.

2141
02:27:25,628 --> 02:27:27,295
You don't mean that.

2142
02:27:28,631 --> 02:27:30,215
A little.

2143
02:27:32,760 --> 02:27:34,553
The kids miss you.

2144
02:27:34,720 --> 02:27:36,596
I can't have them see me like this.

2145
02:27:36,764 --> 02:27:40,892
Neither can I.
So do whatever you have to...

2146
02:27:41,519 --> 02:27:43,270
...but finish this.

2147
02:28:10,715 --> 02:28:12,465
Dave.

2148
02:28:12,633 --> 02:28:14,759
Dave. It's Robert.

2149
02:28:16,554 --> 02:28:18,013
- Dave!
- Is he actually here?

2150
02:28:18,180 --> 02:28:19,931
I'm gonna kill him.

2151
02:28:20,391 --> 02:28:23,435
- Dave.
- I'm calling S.F.P.D. Where's my gun?

2152
02:28:25,396 --> 02:28:28,315
- Dave.
- Robert, go away.

2153
02:28:28,482 --> 02:28:31,192
- Dave, he made a mistake.
- Get away from the window.

2154
02:28:31,360 --> 02:28:34,446
- I'll meet you around front.
- No, you won't.

2155
02:28:35,406 --> 02:28:37,532
- You have to hear this.
- No, I don't, Robert.

2156
02:28:37,700 --> 02:28:40,160
The birthday was the one time
that he was weak.

2157
02:28:40,328 --> 02:28:43,204
- The one time he gave something away.
- I'm calling the police.

2158
02:28:43,372 --> 02:28:45,248
It's Arthur Leigh Allen!

2159
02:28:50,379 --> 02:28:51,796
Where did you get that name?

2160
02:28:52,715 --> 02:28:55,008
He called the Bellis' house.
December '69.

2161
02:28:55,176 --> 02:28:58,637
"I need to kill. Today's my birthday."
It was his birthday.

2162
02:28:58,804 --> 02:29:01,848
Arthur Leigh Allen
was born on December 18th.

2163
02:29:04,769 --> 02:29:06,436
Get in here.

2164
02:29:08,272 --> 02:29:11,191
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

2165
02:29:13,486 --> 02:29:15,362
He wrote me, you know?

2166
02:29:15,947 --> 02:29:20,033
2500 suspects, the only one who ever
wrote me a letter was Leigh Allen.

2167
02:29:21,744 --> 02:29:25,163
- They like to help, you know, sometimes.
- Yes, Robert, I know.

2168
02:29:26,499 --> 02:29:29,167
He was arrested January 1975
for molestation.

2169
02:29:29,335 --> 02:29:31,002
He sent me that when he got out.

2170
02:29:31,170 --> 02:29:33,880
"If I can ever be of any help to you,
just let me know.

2171
02:29:34,048 --> 02:29:37,467
I'm sorry I wasn't your man."
And it's typewritten.

2172
02:29:37,635 --> 02:29:40,303
Using a typewriter is not a crime.

2173
02:29:41,555 --> 02:29:43,723
And he knew Darlene.

2174
02:29:44,642 --> 02:29:46,935
It's in the Vallejo files.

2175
02:29:51,857 --> 02:29:55,318
Mulanax said
that he was your favorite suspect...

2176
02:29:55,486 --> 02:30:00,073
...that you spent two years on him,
and that nobody ever came close.

2177
02:30:02,368 --> 02:30:04,536
All the evidence said no.

2178
02:30:05,579 --> 02:30:07,747
Sherwood disqualified his handwriting.

2179
02:30:07,915 --> 02:30:11,084
The same Sherwood
that drinks like Paul Avery now?

2180
02:30:12,169 --> 02:30:16,006
Yes, you have Morrill saying this won't
work, but you also have Terry Pascoe...

2181
02:30:16,173 --> 02:30:17,674
- His protg.
- Yeah, his protg.

2182
02:30:17,842 --> 02:30:19,592
But a handwriting expert nonetheless.

2183
02:30:19,760 --> 02:30:22,095
And he's saying,
"Do not disqualify this suspect."

2184
02:30:22,263 --> 02:30:23,930
So the two cancel each other out.

2185
02:30:24,098 --> 02:30:27,809
They don't. It was Sherwood's case. He
was the head of Questioned Documents.

2186
02:30:27,977 --> 02:30:32,230
If it went to trial, all the defense would
have to do is call Sherwood to the stand.

2187
02:30:32,398 --> 02:30:36,317
There was no way of getting Allen into
court, because there was no evidence.

2188
02:30:36,485 --> 02:30:38,820
What do you mean?
You have him with the ciphers.

2189
02:30:38,988 --> 02:30:41,197
The military boot prints.
The same size gloves.

2190
02:30:41,365 --> 02:30:44,868
The Most Dangerous Game. The watch.
The background with school children.

2191
02:30:45,036 --> 02:30:46,953
The misspellings of "Christ-mass."
Knives.

2192
02:30:47,121 --> 02:30:48,580
All circumstantial.

2193
02:30:48,748 --> 02:30:51,541
Paul Stine's shirt, his wallet, his keys.

2194
02:30:51,709 --> 02:30:55,211
We should have found one of
those things in that trailer. We didn't.

2195
02:30:57,757 --> 02:31:01,593
Catherine Allen states that Leigh cleaned
out his trailer on Friday after work...

2196
02:31:01,761 --> 02:31:05,597
...and moved it to Santa Rosa
on Saturday, August 7th, 1971.

2197
02:31:05,765 --> 02:31:09,225
You interviewed him on August 4th.
So he's cleaning out his trailer...

2198
02:31:09,393 --> 02:31:12,937
...he's moving into a different county
48 hours after you interviewed him?

2199
02:31:15,107 --> 02:31:16,274
Okay. Okay.

2200
02:31:16,442 --> 02:31:18,985
- Look at the stuff side by side, Dave.
- All right.

2201
02:31:19,153 --> 02:31:21,905
Okay, Arthur Leigh Allen and the Zodiac,
their timelines.

2202
02:31:22,073 --> 02:31:24,741
- When was the first murder in Vallejo?
- Christmas, 1968.

2203
02:31:24,909 --> 02:31:27,702
Eight months before,
Allen is fired for molesting students.

2204
02:31:27,870 --> 02:31:29,704
His family discovers he's a pedophile.

2205
02:31:29,872 --> 02:31:32,040
- When do the letters begin?
- July '69.

2206
02:31:32,208 --> 02:31:34,209
After the murder of Darlene Ferrin.

2207
02:31:34,376 --> 02:31:36,795
And they continue
until you go to see him at work.

2208
02:31:36,962 --> 02:31:40,298
After that, do any of the letters
contain swatches of Stine's shirt?

2209
02:31:40,466 --> 02:31:43,468
No, he dumped them. He got scared.
He knew you were onto him.

2210
02:31:43,636 --> 02:31:45,553
So when's the next letter from Zodiac?

2211
02:31:45,721 --> 02:31:47,931
Not until January of 1974.

2212
02:31:48,099 --> 02:31:51,267
He is silent for three years.
In '74, he feels comfortable again.

2213
02:31:51,435 --> 02:31:53,269
Everybody's moved off Allen
as a suspect.

2214
02:31:53,437 --> 02:31:57,941
What do we get? Three new letters from
Zodiac in January, May and July in '74.

2215
02:31:58,609 --> 02:32:01,111
- But then the letters stop.
- What happens to Allen?

2216
02:32:05,324 --> 02:32:07,492
He's arrested.

2217
02:32:07,660 --> 02:32:10,912
January, 1975,
they send him to Atascadero.

2218
02:32:11,080 --> 02:32:13,790
We don't get another letter
the entire time he's there.

2219
02:32:13,958 --> 02:32:16,626
- When is he released?
- August '77.

2220
02:32:16,794 --> 02:32:20,463
Allen gets out. He types you
an apology, and then what?

2221
02:32:20,631 --> 02:32:23,716
We get our first new Zodiac letter
in four years.

2222
02:32:29,557 --> 02:32:32,725
Okay, Zodiac had to have known
Darlene Ferrin, right?

2223
02:32:32,893 --> 02:32:35,228
Yes, the phone calls
on the night of her murder.

2224
02:32:35,396 --> 02:32:39,983
Because of the Vallejo file, we know
that Darlene knew a man named Leigh?

2225
02:32:40,151 --> 02:32:42,986
- Yes.
- So all coincidence aside, Robert...

2226
02:32:43,154 --> 02:32:46,030
...how can you be sure that Leigh
is the Leigh from this file?

2227
02:32:46,198 --> 02:32:49,784
Vallejo is small, but it's not that small.
How do you put the two together?

2228
02:32:49,952 --> 02:32:52,620
A case that's covered
Northern and Southern California...

2229
02:32:52,788 --> 02:32:55,665
...with victims and suspects
spread over hundreds of miles...

2230
02:32:55,833 --> 02:32:58,042
...would you agree?
- Yes.

2231
02:32:58,919 --> 02:33:01,421
Darlene worked
at the Vallejo House of Pancakes...

2232
02:33:01,589 --> 02:33:03,631
...on the corner of Tennessee and Caroll.

2233
02:33:07,094 --> 02:33:11,347
Arthur Leigh Allen lived in
his mother's basement on Fresno Street.

2234
02:33:13,601 --> 02:33:18,188
Door to door, that is less than 50 yards.

2235
02:33:20,399 --> 02:33:21,733
Is that true?

2236
02:33:22,985 --> 02:33:24,736
I've walked it.

2237
02:33:28,240 --> 02:33:30,241
Jesus Christ.

2238
02:33:36,415 --> 02:33:38,082
So?

2239
02:33:41,337 --> 02:33:44,297
- The prints, the handwriting...
- I'm not asking you as a cop.

2240
02:33:44,465 --> 02:33:46,466
But I am a cop.

2241
02:33:48,886 --> 02:33:50,637
I can't prove this.

2242
02:33:50,804 --> 02:33:53,932
Just because you can't prove it,
doesn't mean it's not true.

2243
02:33:54,099 --> 02:33:56,184
Easy, Dirty Harry.

2244
02:33:59,271 --> 02:34:01,064
Finish the book.

2245
02:34:09,740 --> 02:34:13,034
Thank you. Thank you for breakfast.

2246
02:35:20,436 --> 02:35:22,103
Can I help you?

2247
02:35:23,689 --> 02:35:25,106
No.

2248
02:36:45,771 --> 02:36:47,438
Mr. Mageau.

2249
02:36:48,065 --> 02:36:51,609
- Thanks for coming to see me.
- You're the one I talked to on the phone?

2250
02:36:51,777 --> 02:36:56,155
I'm George Bawart, Vallejo P.D.
I took over for Jack Mulanax.

2251
02:36:56,323 --> 02:36:59,283
It's been 22 years.
I don't know how I can help you.

2252
02:36:59,451 --> 02:37:02,161
This is just a formality.
I'm gonna show you photographs.

2253
02:37:02,329 --> 02:37:05,790
Now, the person that shot you may
or may not be among these photographs.

2254
02:37:06,500 --> 02:37:10,002
You don't have to pick anybody because
I'm showing you these, understand?

2255
02:37:10,170 --> 02:37:12,130
Yes, sir, I do.

2256
02:37:12,297 --> 02:37:14,132
All right.

2257
02:37:14,716 --> 02:37:16,467
Take your time.

2258
02:37:16,677 --> 02:37:19,262
If you don't recognize anyone,
that's okay.

2259
02:37:30,983 --> 02:37:32,650
That's him.

2260
02:37:33,902 --> 02:37:35,570
How sure are you?

2261
02:37:35,821 --> 02:37:37,488
I'm pretty sure.

2262
02:37:40,576 --> 02:37:42,618
- He had a round face like this guy.
- Wait.

2263
02:37:42,786 --> 02:37:44,954
You're now identifying
this second photograph?

2264
02:37:45,122 --> 02:37:48,458
No, no. Just that he had a round face
like that.

2265
02:37:50,043 --> 02:37:51,252
It's this man.

2266
02:37:52,296 --> 02:37:53,963
All right.

2267
02:37:55,507 --> 02:37:59,343
Now, on a scale of one to 10,
10 being positive...

2268
02:38:02,639 --> 02:38:04,557
...how sure are you?

2269
02:38:08,020 --> 02:38:09,687
At least an eight.

2270
02:38:12,441 --> 02:38:17,361
Last time I saw this face
was July 4th, 1969.

2271
02:38:19,573 --> 02:38:23,534
I am very sure
that's the man who shot me.
