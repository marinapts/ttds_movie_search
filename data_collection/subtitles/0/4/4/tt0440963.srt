All right.

338
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:13,209
Good morning, sir.
Can I take your order?
Yes.

339
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:18,147
I'll have the Heart-Healthy
omelet with goat cheese
and peppers, please.

340

<i>I'm good.</i>

343
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:28,381
So, when the Director called
and it was suggested that
we bring you on...

344
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:31,428
Suggested? You sure it
was just a suggestion?

a favor for you, Pam,

348

to complete some unfinished
business.

And we both want
the same thing.

352
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,581

in two very different ways.

Pam. All right?

354

We were careless
in Stockholm.

355
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,357
So what was Waterloo?
Just careless again?

356
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:09,798
We had a leak. A serious
national security situation.

357
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,735
Bourne showed up on our
surveillance and we had
very little time to react.

And a reporter got killed.

359

Bourne saw us coming.
The question is what
was he doing there?

360
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:19,609
No, the real question
is how you managed

361
