1
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,610
<i>Remember, remember</i>
<i>The 5th of November</i>

2
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,476
<i>The gunpowder treason and plot</i>

3
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:49,913
<i>I know of no reason</i>
<i>Why the gunpowder treason</i>

4
00:00:50,085 --> 00:00:52,019
<i>Should ever be forgot</i>

5
00:00:55,357 --> 00:00:56,984
<i>But what of the man?</i>

6
00:00:58,527 --> 00:01:00,688
<i>I know his name was Guy Fawkes...</i>

7
00:01:00,862 --> 00:01:05,595
<i>...and I know in 1605, he attempted</i>
<i>to blow up the Houses of Parliament.</i>

8
00:01:05,767 --> 00:01:07,997
<i>But who was he really?</i>

9
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,603
<i>What was he like?</i>

10
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:19,903
<i>We are told to remember the idea</i>
<i>and not the man.</i>

11
00:01:20,082 --> 00:01:21,640
<i>Because a man can fail.</i>

12
00:01:22,784 --> 00:01:26,811
<i>He can be caught</i>,
<i>he can be killed and forgotten.</i>

13
00:01:26,988 --> 00:01:29,047
<i>But 400 years later...</i>

14
00:01:29,224 --> 00:01:31,954
<i>...an idea can still change the world.</i>

15
00:01:33,428 --> 00:01:36,955
<i>I have witnessed firsthand</i>
<i>the power of ideas.</i>

16
00:01:37,499 --> 00:01:39,558
<i>I've seen people kill</i>
<i>in the name of them...</i>

17
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,097
<i>...and die defending them.</i>

18
00:01:45,073 --> 00:01:47,337
<i>But you cannot kiss an idea...</i>

19
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,745
<i>...cannot touch it or hold it.</i>

20
00:01:51,813 --> 00:01:55,510
<i>Ideas do not bleed.</i>
<i>They do not feel pain.</i>

21
00:01:55,884 --> 00:01:57,784
<i>They do not love.</i>

22
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:03,151
<i>And it is not an idea that I miss.</i>

23
00:02:03,325 --> 00:02:05,293
<i>It is a man.</i>

24
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,987
<i>A man that made me remember</i>
<i>the 5th of November.</i>

25
00:02:09,164 --> 00:02:11,257
<i>A man that I will never forget.</i>

26
00:02:24,246 --> 00:02:29,684
<i>So I read that the former United States</i>
<i>is so desperate for medical supplies...</i>

27
00:02:29,851 --> 00:02:34,879
<i>...that they have allegedly sent several</i>
<i>containers filled with wheat and tobacco.</i>

28
00:02:35,056 --> 00:02:38,492
<i>A gesture, they said, of goodwill.</i>

29
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,521
<i>You wanna know what I think?</i>

30
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,328
<i>Well, you're listening to my show</i>,
<i>so I will assume you do.</i>

31
00:02:44,499 --> 00:02:47,866
<i>It's high time we let the colonies know</i>
<i>what we really think of them.</i>

32
00:02:48,036 --> 00:02:52,302
<i>I think it's payback time for a little tea party</i>
<i>they threw for us a few hundred years ago.</i>

33
00:02:52,474 --> 00:02:55,671
<i>I say we go down to those docks tonight</i>
<i>and dump that crap...</i>

34
00:02:55,844 --> 00:02:59,143
<i>...where everything from</i>
<i>the Ulcered Sphincter of Ass-erica belongs!</i>

35
00:02:59,314 --> 00:03:01,714
<i>Who's with me? Who's bloody with me?!</i>

36
00:03:03,018 --> 00:03:04,485
<i>Did you like that?</i>

37
00:03:04,653 --> 00:03:08,817
<i>U.S.A., Ulcered Sphincter of Ass-erica.</i>
<i>I mean, what else can you say?</i>

38
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:12,551
<i>Here was a country that had everything</i>,
<i>absolutely everything...</i>

39
00:03:12,727 --> 00:03:15,059
<i>...and now, 20 years later, is what?</i>

40
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:18,893
<i>The world's biggest leper colony. Why?</i>

41
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:21,165
<i>Godlessness.</i>

42
00:03:21,336 --> 00:03:22,928
<i>Let me say that again.</i>

43
00:03:23,104 --> 00:03:24,401
<i>Godlessness.</i>

44
00:03:24,706 --> 00:03:28,107
<i>It wasn't the war they started.</i>
<i>It wasn't the plague they created.</i>

45
00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:30,534
<i>It was Judgment.</i>

46
00:03:30,712 --> 00:03:34,842
<i>No one escapes their past.</i>
<i>No one escapes Judgment.</i>

47
00:03:36,384 --> 00:03:38,249
<i>You think he's not up there?</i>

48
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,911
<i>You think he's not watching over</i>
<i>this country?</i>

49
00:03:41,089 --> 00:03:45,287
<i>How else can you explain it?</i>
<i>He tested us, but we came through.</i>

50
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,893
<i>We did what we had to do.</i>

51
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:51,131
<i>Islington. Enfield.</i>
<i>I was there. I saw it all.</i>

52
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:53,699
<i>Immigrants, Muslims...</i>

53
00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:56,595
<i>...homosexuals, terrorists.</i>

54
00:03:56,771 --> 00:04:00,707
<i>Disease-ridden degenerates.</i>
<i>They had to go.</i>

55
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:04,038
<i>Strength through unity.</i>
<i>Unity through faith.</i>

56
00:04:04,212 --> 00:04:08,171
<i>I am a God-fearing Englishman</i>,
<i>and I'm goddamn proud of it!</i>

57
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,716
That's quite enough of that,
thank you very much.

58
00:04:12,487 --> 00:04:14,114
Oh, shit.

59
00:04:16,424 --> 00:04:20,019
<i>A yellow-coded curfew is now in effect.</i>

60
00:04:20,195 --> 00:04:23,494
<i>Any unauthorized personnel</i>
<i>will be subject to arrest.</i>

61
00:04:23,665 --> 00:04:26,190
<i>This is for your protection.</i>

62
00:04:26,368 --> 00:04:29,633
<i>A yellow-coded curfew is now in effect.</i>

63
00:04:29,804 --> 00:04:33,262
<i>Any unauthorized personnel</i>
<i>will be subject to arrest.</i>

64
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:34,874
<i>This is for your protection.</i>

65
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:38,975
- Excuse me.
- Sorry, I didn't see you...

66
00:04:39,147 --> 00:04:40,808
- In a hurry, are we?
- I was just...

67
00:04:40,982 --> 00:04:43,678
- It's past curfew, you know.
- My uncle, he's very sick.

68
00:04:43,852 --> 00:04:47,447
- Sick uncle? What you think on that, Willy?
- It's a load of bollocks.

69
00:04:47,622 --> 00:04:50,523
I made a mistake. I shouldn't be out
after curfew. I know that.

70
00:04:50,692 --> 00:04:54,059
Maybe you could look after us
before getting back to your uncle.

71
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:56,356
See, my friend, he's kind of sick.
Ain't you?

72
00:04:56,531 --> 00:04:59,364
Real sick. Bad case of the blues.
You can feel them.

73
00:04:59,534 --> 00:05:03,231
- Don't touch me!
- Look, Willy, kitty's got claws.

74
00:05:03,405 --> 00:05:06,169
- She just threatened us.
- That she did, that she did.

75
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:07,933
You know what that means,
don't you?

76
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:10,839
It means that we exercise
our own judicial discretion.

77
00:05:11,246 --> 00:05:12,873
And you get to swallow it.

78
00:05:13,048 --> 00:05:15,175
- You're Fingermen.
- She's getting the picture.

79
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,079
No, please, I didn't know. I'm sorry.

80
00:05:17,252 --> 00:05:19,243
Not yet you're not. But you will be.

81
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:22,948
By sunup, if you're not the sorriest
piece of ass in all of London...

82
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,517
...then you'll certainly be the sorest.

83
00:05:29,264 --> 00:05:31,232
Oh, God, no. Please don't do this.

84
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,924
I'll go home.
I won't do it again, I swear! Please!

85
00:05:34,102 --> 00:05:37,333
- What do you think, lads?
- Spare the rod, spoil the child.

86
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:39,097
Help me! Someone help!

87
00:05:39,274 --> 00:05:42,607
The multiplying villainies of nature
do swarm upon him.

88
00:05:43,912 --> 00:05:45,812
- What the hell?!
- Bugger off!

89
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,039
Disdaining fortune,
with his brandish'd steel...

90
00:05:48,216 --> 00:05:50,081
...which smoked with bloody execution.

91
00:05:50,251 --> 00:05:51,741
We're Fingermen, pal.

92
00:06:27,088 --> 00:06:28,646
Jesus Christ! Mercy!

93
00:06:28,823 --> 00:06:30,984
We are oft to blame in this...
'Tis too much proved.

94
00:06:31,159 --> 00:06:34,993
- That with devotion's visage and pious action
we do sugar o'er the devil himself.

95
00:06:35,163 --> 00:06:37,825
- What's that mean?
- Spare the rod.

96
00:06:43,772 --> 00:06:45,501
I can assure you, I mean you no harm.

97
00:06:45,673 --> 00:06:47,334
- Who are you?
- Who?

98
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:49,943
Who is but the form
following the function of what...

99
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,942
...and what I am is a man in a mask.

100
00:06:52,113 --> 00:06:54,172
- Oh, I can see that.
- Of course you can.

101
00:06:54,349 --> 00:06:56,476
I'm not questioning your powers
of observation.

102
00:06:56,651 --> 00:07:00,747
I'm merely remarking upon the paradox
of asking a masked man who he is.

103
00:07:02,357 --> 00:07:05,554
- Right.
- But on this most auspicious of nights...

104
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:09,026
...permit me then, in lieu of
the more commonplace sobriquet...

105
00:07:09,197 --> 00:07:12,325
...to suggest the character
of this dramatis persona.

106
00:07:13,535 --> 00:07:15,093
Voil!

107
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,261
In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran...

108
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,603
...cast vicariously as both victim and villain
by the vicissitudes of fate.

109
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:24,472
This visage, no mere veneer of vanity...

110
00:07:24,646 --> 00:07:28,138
...is a vestige of the vox populi,
now vacant, vanished.

111
00:07:28,316 --> 00:07:32,685
However, this valorous visitation
of a bygone vexation stands vivified...

112
00:07:32,854 --> 00:07:36,585
...and has vowed to vanquish these venal
and virulent vermin vanguarding vice...

113
00:07:36,758 --> 00:07:40,558
...and vouchsafing the violently vicious
and voracious violation of volition.

114
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:49,829
The only verdict is vengeance,
a vendetta...

115
00:07:50,004 --> 00:07:53,701
...held as a votive not in vain,
for the value and veracity of such...

116
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:57,174
...shall one day vindicate the vigilant
and the virtuous.

117
00:08:00,448 --> 00:08:03,679
Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage
veers most verbose.

118
00:08:03,852 --> 00:08:06,787
So let me simply add that it's
my very good honor to meet you...

119
00:08:06,955 --> 00:08:08,650
...and you may call me V.

120
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:12,916
Are you, like, a crazy person?

121
00:08:13,094 --> 00:08:15,119
I am quite sure they will say so.

122
00:08:15,296 --> 00:08:17,264
But to whom, might I ask, am I speaking?

123
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,295
- I'm Evey.
- Evey?

124
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:23,835
E-vey. Of course you are.

125
00:08:24,372 --> 00:08:26,704
- What does that mean?
- It means that I, like God...

126
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:30,106
...do not play with dice
and do not believe in coincidence.

127
00:08:30,278 --> 00:08:32,109
Are you hurt?

128
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,941
No, I'm fine.

129
00:08:34,749 --> 00:08:37,809
- Thanks to you.
- Oh, I merely played my part.

130
00:08:37,986 --> 00:08:41,683
- But tell me, do you enjoy music, Evey?
- I suppose.

131
00:08:41,856 --> 00:08:43,881
You see, I'm a musician of sorts...

132
00:08:44,058 --> 00:08:46,458
...and on my way to give
a very special performance.

133
00:08:46,628 --> 00:08:48,186
What kind of musician?

134
00:08:48,363 --> 00:08:50,228
Percussion instruments
are my speciality.

135
00:08:50,398 --> 00:08:53,731
But tonight I intend to call upon
the entire orchestra for this event...

136
00:08:53,902 --> 00:08:55,927
...and would be honored
if you could join me.

137
00:08:56,104 --> 00:08:58,231
I don't think so.
I should be getting home.

138
00:08:58,406 --> 00:09:00,966
I promise you, it'll be like
nothing you've ever seen.

139
00:09:01,142 --> 00:09:03,906
And afterwards,
you'll return home safely.

140
00:09:06,281 --> 00:09:07,373
All right.

141
00:09:09,384 --> 00:09:10,749
It's beautiful up here.

142
00:09:11,252 --> 00:09:15,313
A more perfect stage
could not be asked for.

143
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,980
I don't see any instruments.

144
00:09:17,158 --> 00:09:20,059
Your powers of observation
continue to serve you well.

145
00:09:20,795 --> 00:09:25,459
But wait. It is to Madame Justice
that I dedicate this concerto...

146
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:28,932
...in honor of the holiday she seems
to have taken from these parts...

147
00:09:29,103 --> 00:09:33,130
...and in recognition of the imposter
that stands in her stead.

148
00:09:34,008 --> 00:09:36,533
Tell me, do you know
what day it is, Evey?

149
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:41,076
- November the 4th?
- Not anymore.

150
00:09:46,955 --> 00:09:50,516
<i>Remember, remember</i>
<i>The 5th of November</i>

151
00:09:50,692 --> 00:09:53,752
<i>The gunpowder treason and plot</i>

152
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:56,897
<i>I know of no reason</i>
<i>Why the gunpowder treason</i>

153
00:09:57,065 --> 00:09:59,590
<i>Should ever be forgot</i>

154
00:10:03,471 --> 00:10:06,304
First, the overture.

155
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:09,368
Yes.

156
00:10:10,144 --> 00:10:11,805
Yes, the strings.

157
00:10:13,715 --> 00:10:15,444
Listen carefully, can you hear it?

158
00:10:16,651 --> 00:10:18,710
Now the brass.

159
00:10:18,886 --> 00:10:20,615
I can hear it!

160
00:10:26,561 --> 00:10:29,689
Look outside, Mommy!
They're playing music!

161
00:10:34,369 --> 00:10:36,530
- How do you do that?
- Wait.

162
00:10:36,704 --> 00:10:38,638
Here comes the crescendo!

163
00:10:46,381 --> 00:10:48,713
How beautiful, is it not?

164
00:11:00,294 --> 00:11:04,560
<i>Gentlemen, you have had four hours.</i>
<i>You had better have results. Mr. Creedy.</i>

165
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:07,662
The Bailey area is quarantined.

166
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:10,065
All significant witnesses
have been detained.

167
00:11:10,238 --> 00:11:11,466
<i>Good. Mr. Etheridge?</i>

168
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:15,666
A recording device was found wired into
the central emergency-broadcast system.

169
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:18,607
The DCD was Tchaikovsky's
<i>1812 Overture</i>.

170
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,214
<i>Add it to the blacklist.</i>
<i>I never want to hear that again.</i>

171
00:11:21,382 --> 00:11:22,610
Yes, sir.

172
00:11:22,784 --> 00:11:26,515
We also doubled our random sweeps
and are monitoring phone surveillance...

173
00:11:26,688 --> 00:11:30,249
...indicating a high percentage of
conversation concerned with the explosion.

174
00:11:30,425 --> 00:11:32,393
<i>Mr. Dascomb</i>,
<i>what are we doing about that?</i>

175
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,960
We're calling it an emergency demolition.

176
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:38,155
We have spin coverage on the network
and throughout the InterLink.

177
00:11:38,332 --> 00:11:42,530
Several experts have been lined up to testify
against the Bailey's structural integrity.

178
00:11:42,704 --> 00:11:45,673
<i>I want Prothero to speak on</i>
<i>the dangers of these old buildings...</i>

179
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,298
<i>...and how we must avoid clinging</i>
<i>to the edifice of a decadent past.</i>

180
00:11:49,477 --> 00:11:53,140
<i>He should conclude that the New Bailey</i>
<i>will become the symbol of our time...</i>

181
00:11:53,314 --> 00:11:56,442
<i>...and the future</i>
<i>that our conviction has rewarded us.</i>

182
00:11:56,617 --> 00:11:57,845
<i>Mr. Heyer.</i>

183
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:01,216
Our surveillance cameras captured
several images of the terrorist...

184
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:04,756
...though the mask obviously makes
retinal identification impossible.

185
00:12:04,926 --> 00:12:10,091
We also managed to get a picture of the girl
that Creedy's men were detaining.

186
00:12:10,264 --> 00:12:12,562
- <i>Who is she, Mr. Finch?</i>
- Not sure yet, sir.

187
00:12:12,734 --> 00:12:15,259
- But we're working on several leads.
- <i>Anything else?</i>

188
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,233
We located the fireworks launch...

189
00:12:17,405 --> 00:12:20,272
...and found traces
of the explosives used at both sites.

190
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:25,708
Unfortunately it appears that
despite the heavy level of sophistication...

191
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,577
...these devices were homemade
with over-the-counter chemicals...

192
00:12:29,751 --> 00:12:32,242
...making them very difficult to trace.

193
00:12:33,488 --> 00:12:36,252
Whoever he is, chancellor,
he's very good.

194
00:12:36,457 --> 00:12:39,790
<i>Spare us your professional annotations</i>,
<i>Mr. Finch. They are irrelevant.</i>

195
00:12:39,961 --> 00:12:41,690
Apologies, chancellor.

196
00:12:41,863 --> 00:12:43,490
<i>Gentlemen, this is a test.</i>

197
00:12:43,664 --> 00:12:46,292
<i>Moments such as these</i>
<i>are matters of faith.</i>

198
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:49,664
<i>To fail is to invite doubt</i>
<i>into everything we believe...</i>

199
00:12:49,837 --> 00:12:51,532
<i>...everything we have fought for.</i>

200
00:12:51,706 --> 00:12:56,643
<i>Doubt will plunge this country back</i>
<i>into chaos, and I will not let that happen.</i>

201
00:12:56,811 --> 00:12:59,336
<i>Gentlemen, I want this terrorist found...</i>

202
00:12:59,514 --> 00:13:03,848
<i>...and I want him to understand</i>
<i>what terror really means.</i>

203
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:05,484
<i>England prevails.</i>

204
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:08,217
England prevails.

205
00:13:14,462 --> 00:13:17,727
- You think people will buy this?
- Why not?

206
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:19,799
This is the BTN.

207
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:22,697
Our job is to report the news,
not fabricate it.

208
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:25,371
That's the government's job.

209
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:28,637
On the lighter side of things...

210
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:32,302
...seems that the crew responsible for
the demolition of the old Bailey...

211
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,540
...wanted to give the old girl a grand,
albeit improvised, sendoff.

212
00:13:37,018 --> 00:13:39,612
<i>Although the demolition had been</i>
<i>planned for some time...</i>

213
00:13:39,787 --> 00:13:42,847
<i>...the music and the fireworks were</i>,
<i>according to the crew chief...</i>

214
00:13:43,024 --> 00:13:45,891
- <i>..."definitely not on the schedule."</i>
- <i>We'll be right back.</i>

215
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,894
Do you believe that load of bollocks?
I mean, there was no bloody demolition.

216
00:13:50,064 --> 00:13:51,531
I saw it, the whole thing.

217
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,399
- Did you see it?
- No. Last night I was...

218
00:13:54,569 --> 00:13:57,868
Yeah, that's right. You went
to see Daddy Deitrich, didn't you?

219
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,539
Evey, there you are.

220
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,869
- You are still working for me.
- Sorry, Patricia.

221
00:14:03,044 --> 00:14:05,410
I need two espressos and three coffees.

222
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,571
And Deitrich is ready for his tea.

223
00:14:09,817 --> 00:14:11,045
I don't get it.

224
00:14:11,219 --> 00:14:15,280
Why does he wear a Guy Fawkes mask?
Didn't Fawkes try to blow up Parliament?

225
00:14:15,456 --> 00:14:19,415
It's not too late.
He's still got another 16 hours.

226
00:14:19,861 --> 00:14:21,852
Maybe he's just getting started.

227
00:14:23,664 --> 00:14:25,097
Yeah?

228
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,591
Okay. A lead on the girl.

229
00:14:27,802 --> 00:14:30,703
Look, don't get me wrong, I love it.
A cow getting crucified.

230
00:14:31,105 --> 00:14:34,040
It's hysterical.
But you'll never get it approved.

231
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,904
You've got to rewrite it, okay?
Gotta go.

232
00:14:37,945 --> 00:14:40,641
I don't recall getting stood up
by a more attractive woman.

233
00:14:40,815 --> 00:14:42,578
- Mr. Deitrich...
- Gordon, please.

234
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,310
I don't need "mister" to make
this body feel any older.

235
00:14:45,486 --> 00:14:47,113
Gordon...

236
00:14:47,288 --> 00:14:50,223
...I was on my way last night,
but there were Fingermen...

237
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:51,983
...and I got scared and went home.

238
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:56,653
Sadly, after last night,
I think our curfew will only get worse.

239
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:15,476
Gotcha.

240
00:15:18,786 --> 00:15:20,811
- Hey, Fred.
- All that been x-rayed?

241
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:22,853
Nope. They're filled with bombs.

242
00:15:23,024 --> 00:15:25,288
Well, wait till commercials
to set them off, okay?

243
00:15:26,694 --> 00:15:28,787
- I can't believe you watch that shit.
- What?

244
00:15:28,963 --> 00:15:30,897
Laser Lass is banging.

245
00:15:44,745 --> 00:15:45,769
What's all that?

246
00:15:45,947 --> 00:15:49,041
Not sure. They just arrived.
Marked for Stage 3.

247
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:50,877
Must be Prothero.

248
00:15:51,052 --> 00:15:55,386
I wish someone had the balls to tell
that brat this station ain't his playground.

249
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,016
What the hell is this?

250
00:16:00,661 --> 00:16:04,859
Just put them over there
until I can figure out what they're for.

251
00:16:05,433 --> 00:16:09,335
This looks serious.
Her parents were political activists.

252
00:16:09,503 --> 00:16:12,666
- They were detained when she was 12.
- What happened to her?

253
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,172
Juvenile Reclamation Project...

254
00:16:15,343 --> 00:16:16,503
...for five years.
- Shit.

255
00:16:16,677 --> 00:16:19,043
We're gonna need backup,
but keep it minimal.

256
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:20,544
You sure about that, sir?

257
00:16:20,715 --> 00:16:24,879
I want a chance to talk to her before she
disappears into one of Creedy's black bags.

258
00:16:37,031 --> 00:16:38,259
Who's that?

259
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:42,266
Don't piss me about. You show me ID,
or I'll get Storm Saxon on your ass.

260
00:16:48,376 --> 00:16:49,604
Fucking hell.

261
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:54,141
Come on, let's move!

262
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:16,701
You two, cover these elevators.
The rest of you follow me.

263
00:17:16,871 --> 00:17:18,532
<i>Attention. Attention.</i>

264
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:24,500
<i>Will all personnel please</i>
<i>evacuate the building.</i>

265
00:17:24,812 --> 00:17:26,439
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

266
00:17:27,114 --> 00:17:29,639
<i>Will all personnel evacuate the building.</i>

267
00:17:35,723 --> 00:17:36,917
What the hell's going on?

268
00:17:37,091 --> 00:17:39,116
- It's jammed.
- Break it down.

269
00:17:44,865 --> 00:17:46,298
Dominic!

270
00:17:47,268 --> 00:17:48,735
Police! Out of the way!

271
00:17:50,905 --> 00:17:51,963
Get out the way!

272
00:17:59,647 --> 00:18:00,978
Damn it!

273
00:18:04,452 --> 00:18:06,920
<i>I'll tell you what I know.</i>
<i>I'll tell you what I know.</i>

274
00:18:07,088 --> 00:18:09,750
<i>I'll tell you what I know.</i>
<i>England prevails.</i>

275
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,491
- Clear the halls.
- Sir.

276
00:18:15,863 --> 00:18:17,694
<i>Help, Storm, help!</i>

277
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,304
Don't touch it.

278
00:18:30,478 --> 00:18:32,605
Dad, what's wrong with the telly?

279
00:18:48,662 --> 00:18:50,323
<i>Good evening, London.</i>

280
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:53,790
- <i>Allow me first to apologize...</i>
- That's the emergency channel!

281
00:18:54,001 --> 00:18:58,097
<i>I do, like many of you, appreciate</i>
<i>the comforts of the everyday routine...</i>

282
00:18:58,272 --> 00:19:02,265
<i>...the security of the familiar</i>,
<i>the tranquility of repetition.</i>

283
00:19:02,443 --> 00:19:03,535
Bloody hell.

284
00:19:03,711 --> 00:19:07,203
<i>I enjoy them as much as any bloke.</i>
<i>But in the spirit of commemoration</i>...

285
00:19:07,381 --> 00:19:08,439
Who's that, Mum?

286
00:19:08,616 --> 00:19:10,516
- <i>whereby important events of the past...</i>

287
00:19:10,684 --> 00:19:14,711
<i>...usually associated with someone's death</i>
<i>or the end of some awful, bloody struggle...</i>

288
00:19:14,889 --> 00:19:17,483
<i>...are celebrated with a nice holiday...</i>

289
00:19:17,691 --> 00:19:20,182
<i>...I thought we could mark</i>
<i>this November the 5th...</i>

290
00:19:20,394 --> 00:19:22,658
<i>...a day that is, sadly</i>,
<i>no longer remembered...</i>

291
00:19:23,097 --> 00:19:27,431
<i>...by taking some time out of our daily lives</i>
<i>to sit down and have a little chat.</i>

292
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:30,593
<i>There are, of course</i>,
<i>those who do not want us to speak.</i>

293
00:19:30,771 --> 00:19:32,033
Let me think, let me think.

294
00:19:32,206 --> 00:19:34,697
<i>Even now, orders are being shouted</i>
<i>into telephones...</i>

295
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,070
<i>...and men with guns</i>
<i>will soon be on their way.</i>

296
00:19:37,244 --> 00:19:39,075
- It's Chancellor Sutler.
- Damn it!

297
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:43,615
<i>Why? Because while the truncheon</i>
<i>may be used in lieu of conversation...</i>

298
00:19:43,784 --> 00:19:46,582
<i>...words will always retain their power.</i>

299
00:19:46,754 --> 00:19:49,222
<i>Words offer the means to meaning...</i>

300
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:52,587
<i>...and, for those who will listen</i>,
<i>the enunciation of truth.</i>

301
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,159
<i>And the truth is...</i>

302
00:19:54,328 --> 00:19:57,729
<i>...there is something terribly wrong</i>
<i>with this country, isn't there?</i>

303
00:19:57,898 --> 00:20:01,299
You designed it, wanted it foolproof.
You said every television in London!

304
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:05,063
<i>Cruelty and injustice</i>,
<i>intolerance and oppression.</i>

305
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:07,571
<i>And where once</i>
<i>you had the freedom to object...</i>

306
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:09,538
<i>...to think and speak as you saw fit...</i>

307
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,941
<i>...you now have censors and surveillance</i>
<i>coercing your conformity...</i>

308
00:20:13,113 --> 00:20:15,946
...<i>and soliciting submission</i>.
- Cameras. We need cameras.

309
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,778
<i>How did this happen? Who's to blame?</i>

310
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,221
<i>Certainly there are those</i>
<i>who are more responsible than others.</i>

311
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:24,289
<i>And they will be held accountable.</i>

312
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:27,427
<i>But again, truth be told</i>,
<i>if you're looking for the guilty...</i>

313
00:20:27,928 --> 00:20:30,328
<i>...you need only look into a mirror.</i>

314
00:20:30,965 --> 00:20:32,626
<i>I know why you did it.</i>

315
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,495
<i>I know you were afraid.</i>

316
00:20:34,668 --> 00:20:38,195
<i>Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease.</i>

317
00:20:38,372 --> 00:20:41,068
<i>There were a myriad of problems</i>
<i>which conspired...</i>

318
00:20:41,242 --> 00:20:44,609
<i>...to corrupt your reason</i>
<i>and rob you of your common sense.</i>

319
00:20:44,778 --> 00:20:46,370
<i>Fear got the best of you.</i>

320
00:20:46,547 --> 00:20:50,779
<i>And in your panic, you turned to</i>
<i>the now High Chancellor Adam Sutler.</i>

321
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:53,476
<i>He promised you order</i>,
<i>he promised you peace...</i>

322
00:20:53,687 --> 00:20:57,418
<i>...and all he demanded in return</i>
<i>was your silent, obedient consent.</i>

323
00:20:57,591 --> 00:21:01,357
- Inspector, they're almost through.
- <i>Last night, I sought to end that silence.</i>

324
00:21:01,528 --> 00:21:03,826
<i>Last night</i>,
<i>I destroyed the Old Bailey...</i>

325
00:21:04,031 --> 00:21:07,364
<i>...to remind this country</i>
<i>of what it has forgotten.</i>

326
00:21:08,168 --> 00:21:12,867
<i>More than 400 years ago, a great citizen</i>
<i>wished to imbed the 5th of November...</i>

327
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,507
<i>...forever in our memory.</i>

328
00:21:14,675 --> 00:21:18,338
<i>His hope was to remind the world</i>
<i>that fairness, justice and freedom...</i>

329
00:21:18,512 --> 00:21:20,503
<i>...are more than words.</i>

330
00:21:20,681 --> 00:21:22,273
<i>They are perspectives.</i>

331
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:24,314
<i>So if you've seen nothing...</i>

332
00:21:24,485 --> 00:21:28,251
<i>...if the crimes of this government</i>
<i>remain unknown to you...</i>

333
00:21:28,422 --> 00:21:32,688
<i>...then I would suggest that you allow</i>
<i>the 5th of November to pass unmarked.</i>

334
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,988
<i>But if you see what I see...</i>

335
00:21:36,163 --> 00:21:40,725
<i>...if you feel as I feel</i>,
<i>and if you would seek as I seek...</i>

336
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:43,802
<i>...then I ask you to stand beside me</i>,
<i>one year from tonight...</i>

337
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:46,132
<i>...outside the gates of Parliament.</i>

338
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,036
<i>And together, we shall give them</i>
<i>a 5th of November...</i>

339
00:21:49,243 --> 00:21:52,406
<i>...that shall never, ever be forgot.</i>

340
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:00,711
Kerosene fog.
He's using our smoke machines.

341
00:22:00,888 --> 00:22:02,412
Cover the exits.

342
00:22:02,589 --> 00:22:05,353
No one gets out.
The rest of you, follow me.

343
00:22:08,762 --> 00:22:09,990
Left.

344
00:22:10,164 --> 00:22:11,563
You go right.

345
00:22:11,732 --> 00:22:13,359
Spread out.

346
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:23,075
Don't shoot! Please don't shoot!

347
00:22:25,346 --> 00:22:26,938
Hold your fire!

348
00:22:33,554 --> 00:22:35,078
He put masks on all of us.

349
00:22:35,255 --> 00:22:36,517
Jesus.

350
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,180
- Don't shoot!
- Wait!

351
00:22:38,392 --> 00:22:39,916
- Wait!
- Hold your fire!

352
00:22:40,094 --> 00:22:42,255
Freeze! Nobody move!

353
00:22:42,463 --> 00:22:44,693
If you're wearing a mask,
get down on your knees!

354
00:22:50,137 --> 00:22:52,037
- Get their masks off.
- Please hurry!

355
00:22:53,941 --> 00:22:55,738
There's a bomb in the control booth.

356
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:57,536
Oh, no.

357
00:22:58,612 --> 00:23:01,877
- Jones, get anyone not wearing a mask out.
- Yes, sir.

358
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:04,415
- Marshal, help carry this man.
- Sir.

359
00:23:04,585 --> 00:23:06,143
Everyone else, let's go.

360
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:16,086
Good God.

361
00:23:16,263 --> 00:23:18,663
Hurry up, you lot! Come on!
Everybody out!

362
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:29,471
Dascomb.

363
00:23:29,643 --> 00:23:33,511
Have you any idea how long
it would take to rebuild this facility?

364
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,739
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

365
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:37,076
Wait, wait!

366
00:23:38,285 --> 00:23:40,753
Don't shoot me, please! It's him! It's him!

367
00:23:41,855 --> 00:23:44,415
On your knees! On your knees!

368
00:23:45,292 --> 00:23:46,987
Please! Please don't hurt me!

369
00:24:14,021 --> 00:24:15,682
Here we go.

370
00:24:21,495 --> 00:24:22,723
I did it.

371
00:24:23,096 --> 00:24:24,324
I did it.

372
00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:30,500
Freeze!

373
00:24:30,671 --> 00:24:33,469
Get your hands on your head.
Do it now or I shoot.

374
00:24:35,209 --> 00:24:39,908
I must say that I am rather astonished
by the response time of London's finest.

375
00:24:40,781 --> 00:24:44,148
I hadn't expected you to be
quite so Johnny-on-the-spot.

376
00:24:44,318 --> 00:24:46,912
We were here before you even started.
Bad luck, chummy.

377
00:24:47,087 --> 00:24:48,384
I don't know about that.

378
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:07,204
<i>We're interrupting your regularly scheduled</i>
<i>program to bring you this terrifying report...</i>

379
00:25:07,374 --> 00:25:11,003
<i>...of a terrorist takeover of Jordan Tower</i>
<i>which ended only moments ago.</i>

380
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:14,409
<i>A psychotic terrorist</i>,
<i>identified only as the letter v...</i>

381
00:25:14,581 --> 00:25:18,540
<i>...attacked the control booth with</i>
<i>high-powered explosives and weapons...</i>

382
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:22,849
<i>...that he used against unarmed civilians</i>
<i>in order to broadcast a message of hate.</i>

383
00:25:23,357 --> 00:25:27,623
<i>We've just received this footage</i>
<i>of a daring police raid.</i>

384
00:25:28,562 --> 00:25:33,431
<i>Stop! Stop, stay where you are</i>,
<i>or we'll shoot! Stay where you are!</i>

385
00:25:35,469 --> 00:25:37,937
<i>Now, this is only an initial report...</i>

386
00:25:38,438 --> 00:25:42,101
<i>...but at this time, it's believed</i>
<i>that during this heroic raid...</i>

387
00:25:42,276 --> 00:25:44,107
<i>...the terrorist was shot and killed.</i>

388
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:45,506
Bollocks.

389
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,137
<i>Again, from what we've been told</i>
<i>by authorities, the danger is now over.</i>

390
00:25:49,316 --> 00:25:50,943
<i>The terrorist is dead.</i>

391
00:25:54,955 --> 00:25:57,822
Right there. What's he thinking?

392
00:25:58,292 --> 00:26:00,453
Is he considering leaving her?

393
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:04,060
After she just saved him?

394
00:26:05,198 --> 00:26:09,294
He's a terrorist. You can't expect him
to act like you or me.

395
00:26:09,469 --> 00:26:11,528
Some part of him's human.

396
00:26:12,306 --> 00:26:15,639
And, for better or worse,
she's stuck with him.

397
00:27:42,596 --> 00:27:45,224
- You scared me.
- My apologies.

398
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:48,324
- Are you feeling all right?
- Yes, thank you.

399
00:27:48,502 --> 00:27:50,936
- What is this place?
- It's my home.

400
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:54,562
- I call it the Shadow Gallery.
- It's beautiful.

401
00:27:54,741 --> 00:27:57,676
- Where did you get all this stuff?
- Oh, here and there.

402
00:27:57,844 --> 00:28:01,439
Much of it from the vaults of
the Ministry of objectionable Materials.

403
00:28:01,615 --> 00:28:03,549
- You stole them?
- Heavens, no.

404
00:28:03,717 --> 00:28:05,582
Stealing implies ownership.

405
00:28:05,752 --> 00:28:08,915
You can't steal from the censor.
I merely reclaimed them.

406
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:10,852
God, if they ever find this place...

407
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:14,983
I suspect if they do, a few bits of art
will be the least of my worries.

408
00:28:15,162 --> 00:28:17,426
You mean, after what you've done.

409
00:28:18,065 --> 00:28:20,260
God, what have I done?

410
00:28:20,434 --> 00:28:22,561
I Maced that detective.
Why did I do that?

411
00:28:22,736 --> 00:28:26,297
- You did what you thought was right.
- No, I shouldn't have done that.

412
00:28:26,473 --> 00:28:28,407
I must have been out of my mind.

413
00:28:28,575 --> 00:28:31,806
Is that what you really think,
or what they'd want you to think?

414
00:28:32,312 --> 00:28:33,802
I think I should go.

415
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,039
- May I ask where?
- Home. I have to go home.

416
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:40,152
They're looking for you. If they know
where you work, they know where you live.

417
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,155
- I have friends, I could stay with them.
- I'm afraid that won't work either.

418
00:28:45,325 --> 00:28:48,453
You have to understand, Evey,
I didn't want this for either of us...

419
00:28:48,628 --> 00:28:50,289
...but I couldn't see any other way.

420
00:28:50,464 --> 00:28:52,728
You were unconscious
and I had to make a decision.

421
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:57,097
If I had left you there, right now you'd be
in one of Creedy's interrogation cells.

422
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:01,172
They'd imprison you, torture you,
and, in all probability, kill you...

423
00:29:01,341 --> 00:29:03,309
...in the pursuit of finding me.

424
00:29:03,477 --> 00:29:05,877
After what you did,
I couldn't let that happen...

425
00:29:06,046 --> 00:29:10,039
...so I picked you up and carried you
to the only place I knew you'd be safe:

426
00:29:10,217 --> 00:29:11,809
Here, to my home.

427
00:29:12,385 --> 00:29:15,752
I won't tell anyone, I swear.
You know you can trust me.

428
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:18,356
I'm sorry, but I can't take that risk.

429
00:29:18,525 --> 00:29:20,516
But I don't even know where this is.

430
00:29:20,694 --> 00:29:23,686
You know it's underground.
You know the color of the stone.

431
00:29:23,864 --> 00:29:27,891
- That'd be enough for a clever man.
- Are you saying that I have to stay here?

432
00:29:28,068 --> 00:29:31,435
Only until I'm done.
After the 5th, I no longer think it'll matter.

433
00:29:31,605 --> 00:29:33,573
You mean a year from now?

434
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,537
I have to stay here for a year?

435
00:29:35,709 --> 00:29:38,678
Sorry, Evey.
I didn't know what else to do.

436
00:29:38,845 --> 00:29:40,506
You should've left me alone.

437
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,046
Why didn't you just leave me alone?!

438
00:29:45,886 --> 00:29:49,049
- Anything else on the parents?
- Yeah, it ain't good.

439
00:29:49,222 --> 00:29:51,247
They were interned at Belmarsh.

440
00:29:51,424 --> 00:29:53,119
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

441
00:29:53,293 --> 00:29:56,694
She died in a hunger strike.
He died when the military retook the shed.

442
00:29:57,097 --> 00:30:00,157
And that ain't the worst of it.
Her brother was at St. Mary's.

443
00:30:00,801 --> 00:30:03,497
- Christ.
- It's nothing but bad luck here.

444
00:30:03,937 --> 00:30:07,373
So we know her story. Now we need his.

445
00:30:29,162 --> 00:30:30,390
V?

446
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:36,624
I just wanted to apologize
for my reaction last night.

447
00:30:37,304 --> 00:30:41,468
I understand what you did for me,
and I want you to know I am grateful.

448
00:30:42,542 --> 00:30:44,009
Your hands.

449
00:30:45,612 --> 00:30:46,977
Yes.

450
00:30:51,184 --> 00:30:52,947
There, that's better.

451
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:55,178
I hope I didn't put you off your appetite.

452
00:30:55,355 --> 00:30:59,121
- No, please. It's just... Are you all right?
- Yes, yes, yes, I'm fine.

453
00:30:59,292 --> 00:31:00,725
Can I ask what happened?

454
00:31:01,728 --> 00:31:04,788
There was a fire. A long time ago.

455
00:31:04,965 --> 00:31:07,092
Ancient history, for some.

456
00:31:07,267 --> 00:31:09,132
Not really very good table conversation.

457
00:31:09,302 --> 00:31:11,964
Now, would you care for a cup of tea
with your egg?

458
00:31:12,405 --> 00:31:15,738
- Yes, thank you. I'm starving, actually.
- Have a seat.

459
00:31:23,717 --> 00:31:26,447
- It's delicious.
- Good.

460
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:29,714
God, I haven't had real butter
since I was a little girl.

461
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,118
Where did you get it?

462
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:34,488
A government supply train
on its way to Chancellor Sutler.

463
00:31:35,462 --> 00:31:38,363
- You stole this from Chancellor Sutler?
- Yes.

464
00:31:38,531 --> 00:31:39,759
You're insane.

465
00:31:39,933 --> 00:31:43,801
I dare do all that may become a man.
Who dares more is none.

466
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:46,404
- <i>Macbeth.</i>
- Very good.

467
00:31:46,573 --> 00:31:49,508
My mum, she used to
read all his plays to me...

468
00:31:49,676 --> 00:31:51,940
...and ever since,
I've always wanted to act.

469
00:31:52,112 --> 00:31:54,512
Be in plays, movies.

470
00:31:54,681 --> 00:31:58,242
When I was 9, I played Viola
in <i>Twelfth Night</i>. Mum was very proud.

471
00:31:58,418 --> 00:32:00,477
Where is your mother now?

472
00:32:00,654 --> 00:32:02,451
She's dead.

473
00:32:02,622 --> 00:32:03,850
I'm sorry.

474
00:32:06,192 --> 00:32:08,660
- Can I ask about what you said on the telly?
- Yes.

475
00:32:08,828 --> 00:32:10,420
- Did you mean it?
- Every word.

476
00:32:10,597 --> 00:32:14,533
You really think blowing up Parliament's
going to make this country a better place?

477
00:32:14,701 --> 00:32:16,999
There's no certainty, only opportunity.

478
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:19,730
You can be pretty certain
that if anyone does show up...

479
00:32:19,906 --> 00:32:21,806
...Creedy'll black-bag every one of them.

480
00:32:22,108 --> 00:32:24,542
People should not be afraid
of their governments.

481
00:32:24,711 --> 00:32:26,576
Governments should be afraid
of their people.

482
00:32:26,746 --> 00:32:29,146
And you'll make that happen
by blowing up a building?

483
00:32:30,417 --> 00:32:33,853
The building is a symbol,
as is the act of destroying it.

484
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,783
Symbols are given power by people.

485
00:32:36,389 --> 00:32:39,722
Alone, a symbol is meaningless,
but with enough people...

486
00:32:39,893 --> 00:32:42,555
...blowing up a building
can change the world.

487
00:32:43,363 --> 00:32:45,490
I wish I believed that was possible.

488
00:32:45,932 --> 00:32:50,198
But every time I've seen this world change,
it's always been for the worse.

489
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:54,363
<i>I'll tell you what I know.</i>
<i>I know this is not a man.</i>

490
00:32:54,541 --> 00:32:57,533
- What is he?
- <i>A man does not wear a mask.</i>

491
00:32:57,711 --> 00:33:00,976
- What is he?
- <i>A man does not threaten innocent civilians.</i>

492
00:33:01,381 --> 00:33:04,612
<i>He's what every gutless</i>,
<i>freedom-hating terrorist is:</i>

493
00:33:04,784 --> 00:33:07,014
<i>A goddamn coward!</i>

494
00:33:10,056 --> 00:33:11,523
There will be no negotiation.

495
00:33:11,691 --> 00:33:14,182
When I arrive in the morning,
the Paddy will be gone.

496
00:33:14,361 --> 00:33:17,853
I'm looking at the tape right now,
and he has no idea how to light me.

497
00:33:18,031 --> 00:33:20,727
My nose looks like Big fucking Ben.

498
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:24,358
Listen to me, you bleeding sod,
England prevails because I say it does!

499
00:33:24,537 --> 00:33:27,335
So does every lazy cunt on this show,
and that includes you.

500
00:33:27,507 --> 00:33:30,772
Find another DoP
or find yourself another job.

501
00:33:33,313 --> 00:33:34,837
<i>I'll tell you what I wish.</i>

502
00:33:35,348 --> 00:33:36,975
<i>I wish I'd been there.</i>

503
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:39,243
<i>I wish I'd had the chance</i>
<i>for a face-to-face.</i>

504
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:41,216
<i>Just one chance, that's all I'd need.</i>

505
00:33:46,593 --> 00:33:50,529
<i>This so-called v and his accomplice</i>,
<i>Evey Hammond...</i>

506
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:53,996
<i>...neo-demagogues</i>,
<i>spouting their message of hate.</i>

507
00:33:54,167 --> 00:33:58,729
<i>A delusional and aberrant voice</i>
<i>delivering a terrorist's ultimatum.</i>

508
00:33:58,905 --> 00:34:02,602
<i>An ultimatum that was met</i>
<i>with swift and surgically precise justice.</i>

509
00:34:02,776 --> 00:34:05,574
- No mercy!
- <i>The moral, ladies and gentlemen, is:</i>

510
00:34:05,745 --> 00:34:07,940
Good guys win, bad guys lose...

511
00:34:08,114 --> 00:34:11,515
...and, as always, England prevails!

512
00:34:13,553 --> 00:34:15,453
Holy Christ! Jesus!

513
00:34:16,823 --> 00:34:18,723
Good evening, Commander Prothero.

514
00:34:18,892 --> 00:34:21,452
Oh, my God! How did you get in here?

515
00:34:21,628 --> 00:34:24,756
Don't worry, I've made sure
our reunion won't be disturbed by...

516
00:34:24,931 --> 00:34:27,161
...any pesky late-night phone calls,
commander.

517
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:29,130
Stop. Why do you keep calling me that?

518
00:34:29,502 --> 00:34:34,064
That was your title, remember?
When we first met, all those years ago.

519
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,969
You wore a uniform in those days.

520
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,737
You.

521
00:34:42,115 --> 00:34:45,607
- It is you.
- The Ghost of Christmas Past.

522
00:34:54,027 --> 00:34:57,053
- Yeah?
- <i>Finch, it's Dascomb.</i>

523
00:34:57,897 --> 00:35:00,331
- Dascomb.
- <i>I've already called the chancellor.</i>

524
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:04,334
- <i>We have to get control of the situation.</i>
- What situation?

525
00:35:05,905 --> 00:35:09,898
Chancellor Sutler agreed, for obvious
reasons, we have to keep this discreet.

526
00:35:10,076 --> 00:35:12,636
In the wrong light,
the loss of the Voice of London...

527
00:35:12,812 --> 00:35:14,837
...could be devastating to our credibility.

528
00:35:16,182 --> 00:35:17,809
Perhaps a stroke?

529
00:35:18,351 --> 00:35:20,751
No, no, it's too horrific.

530
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,651
A quiet, dignified death in his sleep.

531
00:35:25,925 --> 00:35:28,587
- We got any eyes or ears on this?
- No, camcos were cut.

532
00:35:28,761 --> 00:35:33,255
It's the same m.o. As before.
But we got an elevator log ID.

533
00:35:33,433 --> 00:35:36,834
- Let me guess.
- She's in deep, inspector.

534
00:35:37,904 --> 00:35:38,893
V?

535
00:35:45,879 --> 00:35:47,847
My fat, metal friend.

536
00:36:00,493 --> 00:36:02,393
Mondego.

537
00:36:08,368 --> 00:36:11,098
Oh, God. I hope I didn't wake you.

538
00:36:11,638 --> 00:36:14,937
No, I just thought you were fighting.
I mean, for real.

539
00:36:15,108 --> 00:36:16,405
My favorite film:

540
00:36:16,576 --> 00:36:21,036
<i>The Count of Monte Cristo</i>,
with Robert Donat as Edmond Dantes.

541
00:36:21,214 --> 00:36:24,445
<i>It is not my sword, Mondego</i>,
<i>but your past that disarmed you.</i>

542
00:36:25,852 --> 00:36:27,217
It gets me every time.

543
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,417
- Never seen it.
- Really?

544
00:36:30,123 --> 00:36:32,853
- Would you like to?
- Does it have a happy ending?

545
00:36:33,193 --> 00:36:35,286
As only celluloid can deliver.

546
00:36:35,662 --> 00:36:37,152
Okay.

547
00:36:37,964 --> 00:36:39,295
Put the sword away.

548
00:36:39,832 --> 00:36:41,732
Forensics just wrapped.

549
00:36:42,268 --> 00:36:45,567
No prints, no hair, no fibers.
The guy is like a ghost.

550
00:36:45,738 --> 00:36:47,569
You won't believe
what they found on Prothero.

551
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,799
- Drugs?
- Could've started his own hospital.

552
00:36:49,976 --> 00:36:51,534
- Interesting.
- Why?

553
00:36:51,711 --> 00:36:55,112
Did you know Lewis Prothero was
one of the richest men in the country...

554
00:36:55,281 --> 00:36:57,044
...before he was
the Voice of London?

555
00:36:57,217 --> 00:36:59,685
- Drugs?
- Legal ones.

556
00:36:59,852 --> 00:37:02,616
Major stockholder
in Viadoxic Pharmaceutical.

557
00:37:02,789 --> 00:37:07,021
Viadoxic and St. Mary's
in less than a week. Coincidence?

558
00:37:07,193 --> 00:37:10,720
When you're at this as long as I've been,
you stop believing in coincidence.

559
00:37:11,531 --> 00:37:13,226
<i>May we come up?</i>

560
00:37:14,267 --> 00:37:16,929
- <i>You find your own tree.</i>
- You find your own tree.

561
00:37:22,342 --> 00:37:24,435
- Did you like it?
- Yeah.

562
00:37:25,211 --> 00:37:28,442
- But it made me feel sorry for Mercedes.
- Why?

563
00:37:29,582 --> 00:37:32,449
Because he cared more about revenge
than he did about her.

564
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,153
- <i>nationwide were devastated</i>
<i>as news of the most popular</i>...

565
00:37:37,323 --> 00:37:38,551
Wait. What's this?

566
00:37:38,725 --> 00:37:41,421
- <i>most awarded stars</i>
<i>in the history of the BTN...</i>

567
00:37:41,594 --> 00:37:44,688
<i>...a man known to the entire nation</i>
<i>as "The voice of London"...</i>

568
00:37:44,864 --> 00:37:47,662
<i>...passed away late last night</i>
<i>from apparent heart failure.</i>

569
00:37:49,102 --> 00:37:52,094
- She's lying.
- How do you know?

570
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:55,264
She blinks a lot when she does a story
she knows is false.

571
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:57,602
<i>It came as no surprise</i>
<i>to those who knew him...</i>

572
00:37:57,777 --> 00:37:59,506
<i>...that his body was at his office...</i>

573
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:03,410
<i>...where he often worked long hours</i>
<i>after everyone else had gone home.</i>

574
00:38:03,583 --> 00:38:06,108
<i>Lewis, you will be sorely missed.</i>

575
00:38:12,592 --> 00:38:15,789
V, yesterday I couldn't find my ID.

576
00:38:15,962 --> 00:38:17,657
You didn't take it, did you?

577
00:38:18,231 --> 00:38:20,859
Would you prefer a lie or the truth?

578
00:38:22,635 --> 00:38:24,796
Did you have anything to do with that?

579
00:38:24,971 --> 00:38:27,906
- Yes, I killed him.
- You...

580
00:38:28,074 --> 00:38:29,541
- oh, God.
- You're upset.

581
00:38:29,709 --> 00:38:32,177
I'm upset?
You just said you killed Lewis Prothero.

582
00:38:32,345 --> 00:38:35,746
I might have killed the Fingermen that
attacked you. I heard no objection.

583
00:38:35,915 --> 00:38:38,383
- What?
- Violence can be used for good.

584
00:38:38,751 --> 00:38:41,311
- What are you talking about?
- Justice.

585
00:38:44,123 --> 00:38:47,752
Oh, I see.

586
00:38:48,094 --> 00:38:50,722
There's no court in this country
for men like Prothero.

587
00:38:52,198 --> 00:38:54,223
And are you going to kill more people?

588
00:38:55,635 --> 00:38:57,034
Yes.

589
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,501
Take a look at this.

590
00:38:59,672 --> 00:39:02,140
Prothero's military record.

591
00:39:03,042 --> 00:39:04,475
What do you see?

592
00:39:05,378 --> 00:39:11,613
Iraq, Kurdistan, Syria,
before and after, Sudan.

593
00:39:11,784 --> 00:39:13,376
- Busy boy.
- But after all that...

594
00:39:13,553 --> 00:39:17,216
...they put him in charge
of a detention facility at Larkhill.

595
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:20,188
Well, no good deed goes unpunished.

596
00:39:21,427 --> 00:39:24,328
You think there's a connection
between our boy and Larkhill?

597
00:39:24,497 --> 00:39:28,365
It might explain the connection
between him and the Hammond girl.

598
00:39:28,735 --> 00:39:32,865
Problem is, I can't find
any other record of it.

599
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:38,375
Larkhill? Larkhill? I cannot recall
that particular facility, inspector.

600
00:39:38,544 --> 00:39:41,911
- You're welcome to review our records.
- We've been through your records.

601
00:39:42,081 --> 00:39:45,608
All it says is that there was
a detention facility at Larkhill...

602
00:39:45,785 --> 00:39:48,310
...approximately 10 miles
north of Salisbury.

603
00:39:48,488 --> 00:39:49,614
Well, there you have it.

604
00:39:51,591 --> 00:39:54,116
This is a matter of some urgency, major.

605
00:39:54,293 --> 00:39:57,456
We need to know if there was anything
different about this facility.

606
00:39:57,797 --> 00:39:59,958
I'm sorry, inspector,
I simply cannot recall.

607
00:40:00,133 --> 00:40:02,897
Was there a specific profile
for those being sent there?

608
00:40:03,436 --> 00:40:06,166
- Usual undesirables, I should think.
- But do you know?

609
00:40:06,339 --> 00:40:09,240
- Of course not. I wasn't stationed there.
- Do you know who was?

610
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:12,606
I cannot recall specific names,
but if you look through our records...

611
00:40:12,779 --> 00:40:17,307
Your records are either deleted,
omitted or missing.

612
00:40:17,483 --> 00:40:19,417
As head of the Detention Program
at that...

613
00:40:19,585 --> 00:40:23,453
Before you go any further, let me remind you
things were very chaotic back then.

614
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:26,320
Now we don't have the problems
we had back then.

615
00:40:26,492 --> 00:40:29,086
We all did what we had to do.

616
00:40:29,262 --> 00:40:32,493
And in those circumstances,
we did the best we could.

617
00:40:32,665 --> 00:40:34,496
That's all I have to say about that.

618
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,605
You can do this.

619
00:40:52,752 --> 00:40:54,185
Hi.

620
00:40:55,354 --> 00:40:57,345
I've been thinking...

621
00:40:58,925 --> 00:41:00,688
There's something I want to ask you...

622
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:04,694
...but I don't think you'll understand why
unless you know a few things about me.

623
00:41:07,066 --> 00:41:10,467
My father was a writer.
You would have liked him.

624
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:13,804
He used to say artists used lies
to tell the truth...

625
00:41:13,973 --> 00:41:16,407
...while politicians used them
to cover the truth up.

626
00:41:16,576 --> 00:41:18,737
A man after my own heart.

627
00:41:18,911 --> 00:41:21,573
He always told the best stories.

628
00:41:22,815 --> 00:41:25,045
Until my brother died.

629
00:41:27,487 --> 00:41:29,352
That was when everything changed.

630
00:41:30,223 --> 00:41:33,681
<i>My brother was one of the students</i>
<i>at St. Mary's.</i>

631
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:37,694
<i>After he died</i>,
<i>my parents became political.</i>

632
00:41:39,632 --> 00:41:43,261
<i>They protested the war</i>
<i>and the Reclamation.</i>

633
00:41:43,436 --> 00:41:48,100
<i>When Sutler was appointed high chancellor</i>,
<i>they were at the riot in Leeds.</i>

634
00:41:48,274 --> 00:41:50,242
<i>I watched on the television...</i>

635
00:41:50,409 --> 00:41:52,843
<i>...thinking I was going</i>
<i>to see my parents killed.</i>

636
00:41:53,412 --> 00:41:55,880
<i>I remember them arguing at night.</i>

637
00:41:56,048 --> 00:41:59,381
<i>Mum wanted to leave the country.</i>
<i>Dad refused.</i>

638
00:41:59,552 --> 00:42:02,578
<i>He said if we ran away, they would win.</i>

639
00:42:02,755 --> 00:42:04,552
<i>Win, like...</i>

640
00:42:04,724 --> 00:42:06,419
<i>...it was a game.</i>

641
00:42:08,694 --> 00:42:10,059
Evey, quick, hide!

642
00:42:25,044 --> 00:42:26,978
- Mummy!
- Evey!

643
00:42:27,146 --> 00:42:28,545
<i>I never saw them again.</i>

644
00:42:29,081 --> 00:42:32,881
It was like those black bags erased them
from the face of the earth.

645
00:42:33,252 --> 00:42:34,810
I'm sorry, Evey.

646
00:42:34,987 --> 00:42:37,581
No, I'm the one that's sorry.

647
00:42:37,757 --> 00:42:40,055
Sorry I'm not a stronger person.

648
00:42:40,226 --> 00:42:43,218
Sorry I'm not like my parents.
I wish I was...

649
00:42:44,597 --> 00:42:46,087
...but I'm not.

650
00:42:46,799 --> 00:42:49,962
I wish I wasn't afraid all the time...

651
00:42:51,737 --> 00:42:53,102
...but I am.

652
00:42:53,272 --> 00:42:56,833
I know this world is screwed up.
Believe me, I know it better than most.

653
00:42:57,009 --> 00:43:01,810
Which is why I wanted to ask, if there is
anything I can do to help make it right...

654
00:43:03,082 --> 00:43:04,947
...please let me know.

655
00:43:05,117 --> 00:43:06,778
If you wish.

656
00:43:14,427 --> 00:43:16,987
Do you really think
you'll find something here?

657
00:43:17,163 --> 00:43:18,687
Worth a shot.

658
00:43:19,432 --> 00:43:21,627
One thing is true of all governments:

659
00:43:21,801 --> 00:43:25,601
The most reliable records
are tax records.

660
00:43:32,111 --> 00:43:35,410
It appears that the original
electronic records have all been lost.

661
00:43:35,581 --> 00:43:39,483
Probably during the Reclamation.
A lot of things went missing back then.

662
00:43:39,652 --> 00:43:43,645
But I found this hard copy
filed in the cold vault.

663
00:43:43,823 --> 00:43:46,087
Everything we've got on Larkhill
is in there.

664
00:43:46,258 --> 00:43:48,726
Thanks. This is a great help.

665
00:44:00,139 --> 00:44:03,666
"By the power of truth, I, while living,
have conquered the universe."

666
00:44:03,843 --> 00:44:06,971
- Personal motto?
- From <i>Faust.</i>

667
00:44:07,146 --> 00:44:09,580
That's about trying
to cheat the devil, isn't it?

668
00:44:09,749 --> 00:44:11,910
It is. And speaking of the devil...

669
00:44:12,084 --> 00:44:14,848
...I was wondering if your offer to help
was still standing.

670
00:44:15,021 --> 00:44:17,353
- Of course.
- It appears unforeseen circumstances...

671
00:44:17,523 --> 00:44:20,321
...have accelerated my original plan.

672
00:44:20,493 --> 00:44:24,224
As a result, I'm in need of someone
with some theatrical skill.

673
00:44:24,397 --> 00:44:25,659
I'll do my best.

674
00:44:26,165 --> 00:44:27,928
I believe you will.

675
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:36,401
Another doctor. Why does
a detention facility need so many doctors?

676
00:44:36,575 --> 00:44:38,475
I don't know, but this is interesting.

677
00:44:38,644 --> 00:44:42,102
The highest-paid person
at the camp was a priest.

678
00:44:42,281 --> 00:44:45,375
- Really?
- Yeah, Father Lilliman.

679
00:44:45,551 --> 00:44:49,385
- Lilliman.
- Was paid almost 200 grand a month.

680
00:44:50,222 --> 00:44:51,780
Now, that is interesting.

681
00:44:53,292 --> 00:44:56,352
Looks like he was promoted.
He's a bishop now.

682
00:44:59,765 --> 00:45:01,733
- Your Grace.
- Oh, Denis.

683
00:45:01,901 --> 00:45:03,596
- Has everything been arranged?
- Yes.

684
00:45:03,769 --> 00:45:05,896
I've just received your InterLink itinerary.

685
00:45:06,072 --> 00:45:08,939
You should arrive in Perth
in time for Mass.

686
00:45:09,108 --> 00:45:10,598
You're most diligent, Denis...

687
00:45:10,776 --> 00:45:14,735
...a noble example for all those
who labor in the name of our Lord, but...

688
00:45:14,914 --> 00:45:17,474
- Your Grace?
- It wasn't labor I was speaking of.

689
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:20,676
It was, rather, my final remittance
that I was interested in.

690
00:45:21,353 --> 00:45:23,082
My last little joy.

691
00:45:23,255 --> 00:45:25,018
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

692
00:45:26,225 --> 00:45:29,524
She has arrived, but there was
some confusion at the agency.

693
00:45:29,695 --> 00:45:32,926
They've sent a new girl who,
I'm afraid, is a little older than usual.

694
00:45:33,099 --> 00:45:34,498
Older?

695
00:45:34,667 --> 00:45:36,828
Oh, dear. She's not too old, I trust?

696
00:45:37,002 --> 00:45:39,232
That is for Your Grace to decide.

697
00:45:51,383 --> 00:45:54,011
- Oh, my.
- Your Grace.

698
00:45:55,621 --> 00:46:00,615
To think that I doubted your loveliness
for an instant.

699
00:46:02,561 --> 00:46:05,223
Mea culpa, my child.

700
00:46:05,397 --> 00:46:06,659
Mea culpa.

701
00:46:12,304 --> 00:46:15,705
Your Grace, we don't have much time
and I have to tell you something.

702
00:46:15,875 --> 00:46:19,902
A confession?
I love the confessional game.

703
00:46:20,412 --> 00:46:21,970
Tell me your sins.

704
00:46:22,148 --> 00:46:23,979
This isn't a game, Your Grace.

705
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:26,448
Someone's coming.
I think he means to kill you.

706
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:28,380
- I'm sorry?
- I'm telling you this...

707
00:46:28,554 --> 00:46:31,114
...because I want some kind
of protection or amnesty.

708
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:34,953
I had nothing to do with the Bailey
and made a mistake in the Jordan Tower.

709
00:46:35,127 --> 00:46:38,221
- I think this should balance it out.
- What are you talking about?

710
00:46:38,397 --> 00:46:40,262
I'm Evey Hammond. I'm...

711
00:46:40,432 --> 00:46:43,629
I've been the prisoner of the terrorist V
for the past several weeks.

712
00:46:43,803 --> 00:46:47,102
I'm telling you that any moment,
he's going to come through that door.

713
00:46:47,306 --> 00:46:50,639
I unlocked the window in the room
where Denis told me to get ready.

714
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:53,108
Wonderful!

715
00:46:53,279 --> 00:46:55,577
It's a game I've never played!

716
00:46:55,748 --> 00:46:59,707
What a delightful mind you have.
I hope the rest of you is just as interesting.

717
00:46:59,885 --> 00:47:03,150
- No, please, you have to believe me.
- Oh, I do, I do, I do.

718
00:47:03,322 --> 00:47:05,415
Let me show you
the firmness of my beliefs.

719
00:47:05,591 --> 00:47:07,024
Stop it! Get off of me!

720
00:47:07,326 --> 00:47:09,317
Seems I've captured
a dangerous terrorist.

721
00:47:09,495 --> 00:47:11,588
Now, how best to procure
her confession?

722
00:47:13,699 --> 00:47:16,668
You little bitch. You fucking little whore!

723
00:47:19,605 --> 00:47:21,197
- Reverend.
- Oh, my God.

724
00:47:21,373 --> 00:47:23,068
She wasn't lying. It is you.

725
00:47:23,242 --> 00:47:25,267
I'm sorry.

726
00:47:25,444 --> 00:47:27,139
- I had to.
- Evey!

727
00:47:31,917 --> 00:47:34,044
And thus I clothe my naked villainy...

728
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:37,246
...with old odd ends
stolen forth from holy writ...

729
00:47:37,423 --> 00:47:40,551
...and seem a saint,
when most I play the devil.

730
00:47:40,726 --> 00:47:42,694
Oh, please, have mercy.

731
00:47:42,895 --> 00:47:44,795
Oh, not tonight, Bishop.

732
00:47:44,964 --> 00:47:46,659
<i>Not tonight.</i>

733
00:47:49,201 --> 00:47:50,759
<i>Don't do this, I beg of you.</i>

734
00:47:50,936 --> 00:47:53,097
Well, then. Children's hour at the abbey.

735
00:47:53,272 --> 00:47:55,263
<i>Open your mouth</i>
<i>and stick out your tongue.</i>

736
00:47:55,441 --> 00:47:58,774
- What the...?
- <i>I don't want to die!</i>

737
00:47:59,612 --> 00:48:02,206
This is Surveillance 109.
We have an emergency.

738
00:48:04,917 --> 00:48:08,683
Run every name in that file.
I want the whereabouts of all of them.

739
00:48:08,854 --> 00:48:10,515
- Tonight.
- Yes, sir.

740
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:13,256
Pucker up, here comes the Finger.

741
00:48:14,026 --> 00:48:16,722
Yeah. Get going. I'll handle him.

742
00:48:21,433 --> 00:48:22,866
Creedy.

743
00:48:23,168 --> 00:48:24,396
What are you doing here?

744
00:48:25,371 --> 00:48:29,432
Several prominent party members
have been murdered, chief inspector.

745
00:48:29,608 --> 00:48:33,840
This is no ordinary situation and requires
more than your ordinary attention.

746
00:48:34,013 --> 00:48:36,811
The chancellor demanded
my immediate involvement.

747
00:48:36,982 --> 00:48:40,008
It'll be hard to investigate
if you're detaining all my witnesses.

748
00:48:40,185 --> 00:48:43,382
The security of information
is paramount.

749
00:48:43,923 --> 00:48:45,390
In these volatile times...

750
00:48:45,557 --> 00:48:48,390
...mistakes like Jordan Tower
can no longer be tolerated...

751
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,926
...if, indeed,
Jordan Tower was an accident.

752
00:48:51,096 --> 00:48:53,360
- What does that mean?
- Terrorist seems to have...

753
00:48:53,532 --> 00:48:56,126
...a rather intimate understanding
of our system.

754
00:48:56,302 --> 00:48:59,100
The chancellor suspects
there might be an informer.

755
00:48:59,505 --> 00:49:01,803
Are you saying I'm under surveillance,
Mr. Creedy?

756
00:49:01,974 --> 00:49:03,737
At this time, it would behoove you...

757
00:49:03,909 --> 00:49:08,903
...to cease any investigation of matters
that have long since passed...

758
00:49:09,081 --> 00:49:12,482
...and concentrate on the concerns
of our present.

759
00:49:13,152 --> 00:49:14,449
You mean Larkhill?

760
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:18,181
Major Wilson is a friend
of the high chancellor.

761
00:49:18,357 --> 00:49:21,622
- His loyalty is not in question.
- But mine is?

762
00:49:22,828 --> 00:49:25,729
Your mother was Irish, wasn't she?

763
00:49:26,398 --> 00:49:29,526
Terrible what St. Mary's
did to Ireland, wasn't it?

764
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:33,400
I've been a party member for 27 years.

765
00:49:33,572 --> 00:49:35,870
If I were you, chief inspector...

766
00:49:36,041 --> 00:49:38,202
...I'd find the terrorist...

767
00:49:38,377 --> 00:49:40,345
...and I'd find him soon.

768
00:49:43,682 --> 00:49:45,206
Please.

769
00:49:49,455 --> 00:49:51,514
Evey? Good God!

770
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:54,215
I'm sorry. I didn't know where else to go.

771
00:49:56,195 --> 00:49:59,187
Yes, well, you better come inside
before someone sees you.

772
00:50:07,706 --> 00:50:10,334
- Cheers.
- I know every cop's looking for me.

773
00:50:10,509 --> 00:50:13,171
I know it's horrible of me
to put you in this situation.

774
00:50:13,345 --> 00:50:15,745
- Evey...
- You could be in terrible trouble.

775
00:50:15,914 --> 00:50:17,404
Evey, listen to me.

776
00:50:17,583 --> 00:50:21,451
If the government ever searched my house,
you would be the least of my problems.

777
00:50:25,657 --> 00:50:27,284
You trusted me.

778
00:50:27,459 --> 00:50:30,519
It would be terrible manners
for me not to trust you.

779
00:50:43,809 --> 00:50:46,300
Oh, my God.
That's <i>God Save the Queen</i>.

780
00:50:46,478 --> 00:50:49,174
My parents took me to it
when they hung it at Gallery 12.

781
00:50:49,381 --> 00:50:53,408
- I thought Sutler had it destroyed.
- He believes he did.

782
00:50:53,585 --> 00:50:56,383
Cost me more than this house,
but no matter how bad I feel...

783
00:50:56,555 --> 00:50:58,386
...it always cheers me up.

784
00:51:00,526 --> 00:51:04,553
- What is that?
- It's a copy of the Koran, 14th century.

785
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:06,891
- Are you a Muslim?
- No, I'm in television.

786
00:51:07,699 --> 00:51:09,098
But why would you keep it?

787
00:51:09,268 --> 00:51:12,499
I don't have to be Muslim to find
the images beautiful, poetry moving.

788
00:51:12,671 --> 00:51:14,639
Is it worth it?
If they found that here...

789
00:51:14,807 --> 00:51:17,105
I told you,
you'd be the least of my worries.

790
00:51:17,743 --> 00:51:19,711
Thank you, Gordon.

791
00:51:19,878 --> 00:51:22,005
- Thank you so much.
- It's all right.

792
00:51:22,181 --> 00:51:25,639
This whole thing started the night
he blew up the old Bailey.

793
00:51:25,818 --> 00:51:28,013
I was on my way here, and...

794
00:51:29,822 --> 00:51:31,289
Yes.

795
00:51:34,493 --> 00:51:37,018
You see, we are both fugitives
in our own way.

796
00:51:37,896 --> 00:51:39,329
- But...
- You're wondering why...

797
00:51:39,498 --> 00:51:42,058
...you were invited here to supper
in the first place...

798
00:51:42,234 --> 00:51:46,295
...if my appetites were
for less conventional fare.

799
00:51:46,472 --> 00:51:50,033
Unfortunately, a man in my position
is expected to entertain...

800
00:51:50,209 --> 00:51:52,803
...young and attractive ladies
like yourself.

801
00:51:53,011 --> 00:51:56,777
Because in this world,
if I were to invite who I desired...

802
00:51:56,949 --> 00:52:00,908
...I would undoubtedly find myself
without a home, let alone a television show.

803
00:52:01,086 --> 00:52:04,055
- I'm sorry.
- Not as sorry as I am.

804
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:07,255
The truth is, after so many years...

805
00:52:07,426 --> 00:52:10,862
...you begin to lose
more than just your appetite.

806
00:52:11,029 --> 00:52:15,056
You wear a mask for so long,
you forget who you were beneath it.

807
00:52:16,602 --> 00:52:20,868
I'm sorry, chief inspector.
Same basic toxicology as Prothero.

808
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:24,065
You could get these poisons
from any house in London.

809
00:52:25,277 --> 00:52:26,801
Thanks, Delia.

810
00:52:27,613 --> 00:52:30,980
Any leads on finding this guy?

811
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:34,483
Nothing yet. But there's something else
you can help me with.

812
00:52:37,256 --> 00:52:40,282
You started as a botanist, didn't you?

813
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,160
It's... It's a Scarlet Carson.

814
00:52:45,664 --> 00:52:47,996
They're believed to be extinct.

815
00:52:49,501 --> 00:52:51,093
He leaves them at the crime scenes.

816
00:52:51,737 --> 00:52:53,967
I'd appreciate it
if you could have a look at it.

817
00:52:54,173 --> 00:52:56,698
Any information could be helpful.

818
00:52:57,509 --> 00:52:59,033
Of course.

819
00:53:00,445 --> 00:53:01,844
Excuse me.

820
00:53:02,614 --> 00:53:03,808
Yeah?

821
00:53:03,982 --> 00:53:08,248
<i>I just finished going through the file</i>,
<i>inspector. You better get back here.</i>

822
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:09,887
Yeah, okay.

823
00:53:11,657 --> 00:53:14,751
- My God. He's killed them all.
- All but one.

824
00:53:15,894 --> 00:53:18,385
- Who is she?
- Not sure.

825
00:53:18,564 --> 00:53:21,124
She's clearly one of the people
in charge at Larkhill.

826
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:24,792
But after they shut it down,
she disappeared for two years.

827
00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:27,564
Till she applied for an overseas visa,
which was denied.

828
00:53:28,173 --> 00:53:29,606
Running away?

829
00:53:29,775 --> 00:53:33,939
Probably, because after that,
all record of her seems to stop.

830
00:53:34,112 --> 00:53:36,512
- She changed her name.
- That's what I'm guessing.

831
00:53:36,682 --> 00:53:39,742
I put a call in to the registry,
but I haven't heard back.

832
00:53:39,918 --> 00:53:43,251
- It's late, or early.
- Call them again. I want that name.

833
00:53:55,634 --> 00:53:57,033
What? Are you sure about that?

834
00:53:57,536 --> 00:53:58,935
Okay. Thank you.

835
00:53:59,905 --> 00:54:03,306
Dr. Diana Stanton changed her name
to Delia Surridge.

836
00:54:03,642 --> 00:54:05,735
- The coroner?
- Yeah.

837
00:54:06,545 --> 00:54:08,012
Jesus, I just saw her.

838
00:54:17,055 --> 00:54:18,886
It's you, isn't it?

839
00:54:19,558 --> 00:54:22,618
- You've come to kill me.
- Yes.

840
00:54:24,096 --> 00:54:25,996
Thank God.

841
00:54:28,133 --> 00:54:30,601
<i>I'm sorry, I can't get a response</i>
<i>from that number.</i>

842
00:54:30,769 --> 00:54:32,703
<i>There's a problem with the connection.</i>

843
00:54:32,871 --> 00:54:34,702
Jesus Christ.

844
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,673
He's there.

845
00:54:37,743 --> 00:54:41,144
After what happened,
after what they did...

846
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:43,639
...I thought about killing myself.

847
00:54:45,951 --> 00:54:49,011
But I knew that one day
you'd come for me.

848
00:54:50,322 --> 00:54:52,517
I didn't know what
they were going to do.

849
00:54:53,325 --> 00:54:54,917
I swear to you.

850
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:56,727
Read my journal.

851
00:54:56,895 --> 00:55:00,126
What they did was only possible
because of you.

852
00:55:01,833 --> 00:55:05,599
Oppenheimer was able to change
more than the course of a war.

853
00:55:05,771 --> 00:55:08,604
He changed the entire course
of human history.

854
00:55:09,841 --> 00:55:12,435
Is it wrong to hold on
to that kind of hope?

855
00:55:12,644 --> 00:55:15,772
I have not come
for what you hoped to do.

856
00:55:15,947 --> 00:55:17,812
I've come for what you did.

857
00:55:19,384 --> 00:55:20,612
It's funny.

858
00:55:20,786 --> 00:55:23,619
I was given one of your roses today.

859
00:55:24,856 --> 00:55:28,087
I wasn't sure you were the terrorist
until I saw it.

860
00:55:30,262 --> 00:55:33,925
What a strange coincidence,
that I should be given one today.

861
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,594
There are no coincidences, Delia.

862
00:55:37,769 --> 00:55:40,738
Only the illusion of coincidence.

863
00:55:40,906 --> 00:55:42,897
I have another rose.

864
00:55:44,109 --> 00:55:46,441
And this one is for you.

865
00:55:52,017 --> 00:55:55,953
- You're going to kill me now?
- I killed you 10 minutes ago...

866
00:55:56,722 --> 00:55:58,519
...while you slept.

867
00:55:59,558 --> 00:56:02,254
- Is there any pain?
- No.

868
00:56:02,527 --> 00:56:03,892
Thank you.

869
00:56:06,298 --> 00:56:09,426
Is it meaningless to apologize?

870
00:56:09,868 --> 00:56:10,960
Never.

871
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:14,138
I'm so sorry.

872
00:56:35,761 --> 00:56:37,490
Damn it.

873
00:56:39,998 --> 00:56:42,831
The terrorist obviously
wanted us to have it.

874
00:56:43,001 --> 00:56:46,562
He wanted us to know the story,
or at least a part of it.

875
00:56:46,738 --> 00:56:49,764
<i>Am I to understand that you have read</i>
<i>this document, inspector?</i>

876
00:56:49,975 --> 00:56:52,034
- Yes, sir.
- <i>Has anyone else read it?</i>

877
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:55,077
- No, sir.
- <i>Then let me make this perfectly clear to you.</i>

878
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,738
<i>The contents of this document</i>
<i>are a matter of national security...</i>

879
00:56:58,917 --> 00:57:02,785
<i>...constituting an assault on the character</i>
<i>of several important party members...</i>

880
00:57:03,155 --> 00:57:06,420
<i>...as well as a blatant violation</i>
<i>of the Articles of Allegiance.</i>

881
00:57:06,591 --> 00:57:09,492
<i>As the authenticity of this document</i>
<i>cannot be verified...</i>

882
00:57:09,661 --> 00:57:13,495
<i>...it could be an elaborate forgery</i>
<i>created by the terrorist...</i>

883
00:57:13,665 --> 00:57:17,362
<i>...as easily as it could be the deranged</i>
<i>fantasy of a former party member...</i>

884
00:57:17,536 --> 00:57:19,697
<i>...who resigned</i>
<i>for psychological reasons.</i>

885
00:57:20,205 --> 00:57:22,765
<i>Any discussion of this document</i>
<i>or its contents...</i>

886
00:57:22,941 --> 00:57:25,876
<i>...will be regarded, at the very least</i>,
<i>as an act of sedition...</i>

887
00:57:26,044 --> 00:57:28,512
<i>...if not a willful act of treason.</i>

888
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:32,013
- <i>Is that understood, Mr. Finch?</i>
- Yes, sir.

889
00:57:32,184 --> 00:57:34,880
<i>You would do well, inspector...</i>

890
00:57:35,053 --> 00:57:37,453
<i>...to put it out of your mind.</i>

891
00:57:46,598 --> 00:57:48,361
<i>May 23rd.</i>

892
00:57:49,734 --> 00:57:52,601
<i>My first batch of subjects arrived today...</i>

893
00:57:53,638 --> 00:57:56,505
<i>...and I have to admit</i>
<i>that I'm very excited.</i>

894
00:57:59,644 --> 00:58:02,477
<i>This could be the dawn of a new age.</i>

895
00:58:03,482 --> 00:58:05,416
<i>Nuclear power is meaningless...</i>

896
00:58:05,584 --> 00:58:08,553
<i>...in a world where a virus</i>
<i>can kill an entire population...</i>

897
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,779
<i>...and leave its wealth intact.</i>

898
00:58:10,956 --> 00:58:14,084
- Stay together!
- Come on, move!

899
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:16,550
<i>May 27th.</i>

900
00:58:16,728 --> 00:58:19,856
<i>Commander Prothero toured the lab</i>
<i>with a priest, Father Lilliman...</i>

901
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:23,865
<i>...who I was told is here to monitor</i>
<i>for Rules and Rights violations.</i>

902
00:58:24,035 --> 00:58:28,301
<i>It made me nervous, but the commander</i>
<i>assured me there wouldn't be a problem.</i>

903
00:58:28,507 --> 00:58:30,338
<i>June 2nd.</i>

904
00:58:30,976 --> 00:58:34,707
<i>I keep wondering if these people knew</i>
<i>how they might be helping their country...</i>

905
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,212
<i>...if they would act any differently.</i>

906
00:58:37,382 --> 00:58:41,318
<i>They're so weak and pathetic.</i>
<i>They never look you in the eye.</i>

907
00:58:41,486 --> 00:58:43,954
<i>I find myself hating them.</i>

908
00:58:47,058 --> 00:58:48,992
<i>August the 18th.</i>

909
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:52,926
<i>Of the original four dozen</i>,
<i>over 75 percent are now deceased.</i>

910
00:58:55,433 --> 00:58:58,698
<i>No controllable pattern has yet emerged.</i>

911
00:59:00,405 --> 00:59:02,202
<i>September the 18th.</i>

912
00:59:02,374 --> 00:59:05,434
<i>There is one case that continues</i>
<i>to give me hope.</i>

913
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:10,274
<i>He exhibits none of the immune-system</i>
<i>pathologies the other subjects developed.</i>

914
00:59:10,448 --> 00:59:14,942
<i>I've discovered cellular anomalies in his</i>
<i>blood that I've been unable to categorize.</i>

915
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,951
<i>The mutations seem to have triggered...</i>

916
00:59:17,122 --> 00:59:21,081
<i>...the abnormal development</i>
<i>of basic kinesthesia and reflexes.</i>

917
00:59:21,259 --> 00:59:23,420
<i>The subject said</i>
<i>he could no longer remember...</i>

918
00:59:23,595 --> 00:59:26,325
<i>...who he was or where he was from.</i>

919
00:59:26,498 --> 00:59:30,264
<i>Whoever he was</i>,
<i>he is now the key to our dream...</i>

920
00:59:30,435 --> 00:59:33,962
<i>...and the hope that all of this</i>
<i>will not have been in vain.</i>

921
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:36,730
<i>November the 5th.</i>

922
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:42,373
<i>It started last night, around midnight.</i>

923
00:59:42,547 --> 00:59:46,415
<i>The first explosions tore open</i>
<i>the entire medical section.</i>

924
00:59:47,619 --> 00:59:50,417
<i>All my work, gone.</i>

925
00:59:50,589 --> 00:59:54,616
<i>I was trying to understand how</i>
<i>it could've happened when I saw him.</i>

926
00:59:54,793 --> 00:59:57,023
<i>The man from room 5.</i>

927
00:59:57,195 --> 00:59:58,423
<i>He looked at me.</i>

928
00:59:58,597 --> 01:00:02,033
<i>Not with eyes. There were no eyes.</i>

929
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,725
<i>But I know he was looking at me</i>
<i>because I felt it.</i>

930
01:00:12,277 --> 01:00:14,302
<i>Oh, God...</i>

931
01:00:14,479 --> 01:00:16,208
<i>...what have I done?</i>

932
01:00:48,346 --> 01:00:49,779
What is that you're making?

933
01:00:49,948 --> 01:00:52,473
We called it "eggie in the basket."
My mum made them.

934
01:00:52,651 --> 01:00:54,482
- This is weird.
- What?

935
01:00:54,653 --> 01:00:58,111
The first morning I was with him,
he made me eggs just like this.

936
01:00:58,289 --> 01:01:00,587
- Really?
- I swear.

937
01:01:00,759 --> 01:01:05,526
That is a strange coincidence.
Although there's an obvious explanation.

938
01:01:05,697 --> 01:01:07,631
- There is?
- Yes, Evey.

939
01:01:07,966 --> 01:01:09,627
I am V.

940
01:01:09,801 --> 01:01:11,268
At last you know the truth.

941
01:01:11,770 --> 01:01:13,135
You're stunned, I know.

942
01:01:13,304 --> 01:01:16,933
Hard to believe, isn't it, that beneath
this wrinkled, well-fed exterior...

943
01:01:17,108 --> 01:01:22,307
...there lies a dangerous killing machine
with a fetish for Fawkesian masks.

944
01:01:24,215 --> 01:01:25,614
That is not funny, Gordon.

945
01:01:25,784 --> 01:01:28,446
Yeah, I know.
I'm useless without a studio audience.

946
01:01:29,054 --> 01:01:31,181
I've seen people go to jail
for less than that.

947
01:01:31,356 --> 01:01:33,256
Of course, he was right, wasn't he?

948
01:01:34,392 --> 01:01:36,792
There is something wrong
with this country.

949
01:01:52,877 --> 01:01:54,367
Morning, inspector.

950
01:01:56,114 --> 01:01:57,877
You're at it early.

951
01:01:59,451 --> 01:02:03,114
Is something wrong?
You don't look so good, sir.

952
01:02:11,396 --> 01:02:13,887
I wanna ask a question, Dominic.

953
01:02:15,266 --> 01:02:17,632
I don't care if you answer me or not.

954
01:02:18,603 --> 01:02:20,798
I just wanna say this aloud.

955
01:02:22,073 --> 01:02:25,839
But I need to know that this question
will not leave this office.

956
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:28,308
Yeah, of course, inspector, but...

957
01:02:29,414 --> 01:02:30,813
Because of the terrorist?

958
01:02:32,283 --> 01:02:33,614
No.

959
01:02:34,786 --> 01:02:37,880
So, what is it, chief? What's going on?

960
01:02:40,658 --> 01:02:44,150
The question I want to ask
is about St. Mary's...

961
01:02:45,096 --> 01:02:46,461
...and Three Waters.

962
01:02:48,633 --> 01:02:53,036
The question that's kept me up
for the last 24 hours...

963
01:02:53,204 --> 01:02:56,002
...the question I have to ask, is:

964
01:02:57,542 --> 01:03:00,409
What if the worst...

965
01:03:01,112 --> 01:03:04,673
...the most horrifying biological attack
in this country's history...

966
01:03:04,849 --> 01:03:08,615
...was not the work
of religious extremists?

967
01:03:08,787 --> 01:03:12,450
Well, I don't understand. We know it was.
They were caught. They confessed.

968
01:03:12,624 --> 01:03:14,751
And they were executed. I know.

969
01:03:14,926 --> 01:03:17,918
And maybe that's really what happened.

970
01:03:20,265 --> 01:03:22,859
But I see this chain of events...

971
01:03:24,202 --> 01:03:27,899
...these coincidences,
and I have to ask:

972
01:03:28,072 --> 01:03:32,668
What if that isn't what happened?
What if someone else unleashed that virus?

973
01:03:32,844 --> 01:03:36,905
What if someone else
killed all those people?

974
01:03:37,081 --> 01:03:39,379
Would you really wanna know
who it was?

975
01:03:40,385 --> 01:03:41,818
Sure.

976
01:03:41,986 --> 01:03:44,318
Even if it was someone
working for this government?

977
01:03:46,257 --> 01:03:47,815
That's my question.

978
01:03:48,293 --> 01:03:51,057
If our own government was responsible...

979
01:03:51,229 --> 01:03:55,529
...for what happened at St. Mary's
and Three Waters...

980
01:03:57,502 --> 01:04:03,873
...if our own government was responsible
for the deaths of almost 100,000 people...

981
01:04:06,845 --> 01:04:08,506
...would you really wanna know?

982
01:04:08,913 --> 01:04:11,143
<i>This has to be the bloody coldest</i>
<i>March in years.</i>

983
01:04:11,316 --> 01:04:13,716
<i>Keep talking like that</i>,
<i>we'll lose our party status.</i>

984
01:04:13,885 --> 01:04:17,616
- <i>They're a pack of lying, greedy hypocrites!</i>
- <i>Keep it down, will you?</i>

985
01:04:21,526 --> 01:04:24,757
Based on random audio sweeps,
I've projected that right now...

986
01:04:24,963 --> 01:04:28,160
...80 percent of the public
believe the terrorist is still alive.

987
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:31,095
We're also showing
a 12-percent increase...

988
01:04:31,269 --> 01:04:34,727
...over last month's positive mention
in all four quadrants.

989
01:04:34,906 --> 01:04:38,398
- <i>Mr. Creedy?</i>
- We're handling it as best we can.

990
01:04:38,576 --> 01:04:41,238
Arrests are as high as they've been
since the Reclamation.

991
01:04:41,412 --> 01:04:43,880
<i>I want more than arrests. I want results.</i>

992
01:04:47,752 --> 01:04:50,277
- What's all this about?
- I'm celebrating.

993
01:04:50,455 --> 01:04:52,582
Celebrating what?

994
01:04:52,757 --> 01:04:55,783
I think this could be
the best show we've ever done.

995
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:57,757
<i>Very good evening</i>,
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

996
01:04:58,963 --> 01:05:02,228
<i>Listen, we've got an extraordinary</i>
<i>show for you tonight.</i>

997
01:05:02,533 --> 01:05:05,798
<i>You're not gonna believe it.</i>
<i>As a matter of fact, I don't think I do.</i>

998
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:08,461
<i>Will you please give</i>
<i>a very warm welcome...</i>

999
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:12,041
<i>...to our own Chancellor Adam Sutler!</i>

1000
01:05:16,547 --> 01:05:18,105
- No way!
- No, it can't be!

1001
01:05:19,951 --> 01:05:23,478
We threw out the censor-approved script
and shot one I wrote this morning.

1002
01:05:23,688 --> 01:05:25,246
Oh, my God.

1003
01:05:37,769 --> 01:05:39,532
<i>Chancellor, chancellor, chancellor...</i>

1004
01:05:39,704 --> 01:05:42,537
<i>...I understand you've been under</i>
<i>tremendous strain lately...</i>

1005
01:05:42,707 --> 01:05:45,835
<i>...since the beginning</i>
<i>of this whole terrorism business...</i>

1006
01:05:46,010 --> 01:05:50,106
<i>...and we thought it would be a nice idea</i>
<i>to try and help you relax. Girls?</i>

1007
01:05:56,287 --> 01:05:59,552
<i>Warm milk. There's nothing better.</i>

1008
01:05:59,724 --> 01:06:02,750
<i>I understand you enjoy a glass</i>
<i>every night, chancellor.</i>

1009
01:06:02,927 --> 01:06:04,724
<i>Since I was a boy.</i>

1010
01:06:05,797 --> 01:06:07,389
<i>But you're wrong, Mr. Deitrich.</i>

1011
01:06:08,059 --> 01:06:11,825
- <i>The terrorist was never a serious concern.</i>
- <i>Oh, really?</i>

1012
01:06:11,996 --> 01:06:14,226
- <i>Chancellor, chancellor</i>...
- It's him.

1013
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:17,630
<i>Are you saying that he's not still alive</i>
<i>and active?</i>

1014
01:06:17,802 --> 01:06:20,464
<i>The terrorist has been neutralized.</i>

1015
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:24,836
<i>Oh, my God! Chancellor, look!</i>

1016
01:06:25,009 --> 01:06:26,636
<i>The terrorist!</i>

1017
01:06:27,212 --> 01:06:28,736
<i>The terrorist!</i>

1018
01:06:30,482 --> 01:06:32,177
<i>Get him!</i>

1019
01:06:34,619 --> 01:06:36,712
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

1020
01:06:55,940 --> 01:06:57,498
<i>At last!</i>

1021
01:06:57,675 --> 01:07:01,611
<i>And now, for all the world to see.</i>

1022
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:04,008
It's him!

1023
01:07:05,183 --> 01:07:09,176
<i>Unhand me! I am your chancellor!</i>

1024
01:07:09,354 --> 01:07:13,051
<i>How dare you! I am the chancellor!</i>

1025
01:07:13,358 --> 01:07:15,292
<i>Imposter!</i>

1026
01:07:21,733 --> 01:07:23,928
<i>Soldiers! That man is the terrorist!</i>

1027
01:07:24,102 --> 01:07:27,037
- <i>I order you to shoot that traitor!</i>
- <i>Liar!</i>

1028
01:07:27,205 --> 01:07:28,229
- <i>Faker!</i>
- <i>Fraud!</i>

1029
01:07:28,406 --> 01:07:30,271
- <i>Ready!</i>
- <i>Aim!</i>

1030
01:07:30,441 --> 01:07:31,908
- <i>Fire!</i>
- <i>Fire!</i>

1031
01:07:43,788 --> 01:07:45,779
What are they gonna do, fine us?

1032
01:07:45,957 --> 01:07:49,415
Big deal. We've got
the most-watched show on air.

1033
01:07:49,594 --> 01:07:52,085
Well, you're my agent,
that's what I pay you for.

1034
01:07:52,263 --> 01:07:54,128
Protect me.

1035
01:07:54,299 --> 01:07:56,130
I should've hired him
to be my mother.

1036
01:07:56,301 --> 01:07:59,065
- You're mad.
- Either that or I wasn't breast-fed.

1037
01:07:59,237 --> 01:08:02,229
- Is everything a joke to you?
- Only the things that matter.

1038
01:08:02,407 --> 01:08:05,638
- What if they come after you?
- I tell you what's gonna happen.

1039
01:08:05,810 --> 01:08:09,007
I'll have to make some kind of apology,
do some boring fundraiser.

1040
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:14,243
In the meantime, our ratings will go
through the roof. It'll be fine. Trust me.

1041
01:08:21,636 --> 01:08:22,864
Gordon?

1042
01:08:25,406 --> 01:08:27,135
Quick, Evey, hide!

1043
01:08:42,156 --> 01:08:45,455
Not so funny now, is it, funnyman?

1044
01:09:35,877 --> 01:09:37,469
- Gotcha.
- No, no.

1045
01:09:50,858 --> 01:09:54,055
Do you know why you're here,
Evey Hammond?

1046
01:09:55,329 --> 01:09:56,557
Please.

1047
01:09:56,731 --> 01:09:59,131
You've been charged
with three counts of murder...

1048
01:09:59,667 --> 01:10:03,159
...the bombing of government property,
conspiracy to commit terrorism...

1049
01:10:03,337 --> 01:10:08,240
...treason and sedition, the penalty
for which is death by firing squad.

1050
01:10:09,477 --> 01:10:14,847
You have one chance,
and only one chance, to save your life.

1051
01:10:15,016 --> 01:10:18,975
You must tell us the identity
or whereabouts...

1052
01:10:19,153 --> 01:10:21,018
...of code name V.

1053
01:10:21,722 --> 01:10:24,316
If your information leads
to his capture...

1054
01:10:24,492 --> 01:10:28,292
...you will be released
from this facility immediately.

1055
01:10:28,462 --> 01:10:31,056
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

1056
01:10:31,232 --> 01:10:34,326
You can return to your life,
Miss Hammond.

1057
01:10:35,436 --> 01:10:38,837
All you have to do is cooperate.

1058
01:10:43,277 --> 01:10:44,835
Process her.

1059
01:12:51,572 --> 01:12:55,303
<i>I know there's no way I can convince you</i>
<i>this is not one of their tricks...</i>

1060
01:12:55,476 --> 01:12:56,875
<i>...but I don't care.</i>

1061
01:12:57,044 --> 01:12:58,841
<i>I am me.</i>

1062
01:12:59,013 --> 01:13:00,742
<i>My name is valerie.</i>

1063
01:13:00,915 --> 01:13:05,943
<i>I don't think I'll live much longer</i>,
<i>and I wanted to tell someone about my life.</i>

1064
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:10,523
<i>This is the only autobiography</i>
<i>that I will ever write and, God...</i>

1065
01:13:11,025 --> 01:13:13,425
<i>...I'm writing it on toilet paper.</i>

1066
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:19,095
<i>I was born in Nottingham in 1985.</i>

1067
01:13:19,266 --> 01:13:24,067
<i>I don't remember much of those early years</i>,
<i>but I do remember the rain.</i>

1068
01:13:24,238 --> 01:13:26,706
<i>My grandmother owned a farm</i>
<i>in Tottle Brook...</i>

1069
01:13:26,874 --> 01:13:29,741
<i>...and she used to tell me</i>
<i>that God was in the rain.</i>

1070
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:32,674
<i>I passed my 11 Plus</i>
<i>and went to girls' grammar.</i>

1071
01:13:32,847 --> 01:13:35,577
<i>It was at school</i>
<i>that I met my first girlfriend.</i>

1072
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:37,342
<i>Her name was Sarah.</i>

1073
01:13:37,952 --> 01:13:39,544
<i>It was her wrists.</i>

1074
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:41,347
<i>They were beautiful.</i>

1075
01:13:43,991 --> 01:13:46,289
<i>I thought we would</i>
<i>love each other forever.</i>

1076
01:13:46,994 --> 01:13:49,155
<i>I remember our teacher telling us...</i>

1077
01:13:49,330 --> 01:13:52,026
<i>...that it was an adolescent phase</i>
<i>that people outgrew.</i>

1078
01:13:52,199 --> 01:13:53,757
<i>Sarah did.</i>

1079
01:13:55,302 --> 01:13:57,133
<i>I didn't.</i>

1080
01:13:57,338 --> 01:14:01,468
<i>In 2002, I fell in love</i>
<i>with a girl named Christina.</i>

1081
01:14:01,642 --> 01:14:03,837
<i>That year I came out to my parents.</i>

1082
01:14:04,011 --> 01:14:07,674
<i>I couldn't have done it</i>
<i>without Chris holding my hand.</i>

1083
01:14:07,848 --> 01:14:13,013
<i>My father wouldn't look at me.</i>
<i>He told me to go and never come back.</i>

1084
01:14:13,187 --> 01:14:14,848
<i>My mother said nothing.</i>

1085
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:19,749
<i>But I'd only told them the truth.</i>
<i>Was that so selfish?</i>

1086
01:14:20,361 --> 01:14:24,730
<i>Our integrity sells for so little</i>,
<i>but it is all we really have.</i>

1087
01:14:24,899 --> 01:14:27,060
<i>It is the very last inch of us.</i>

1088
01:14:27,902 --> 01:14:29,802
<i>But within that inch...</i>

1089
01:14:29,970 --> 01:14:31,198
<i>...we are free.</i>

1090
01:14:33,908 --> 01:14:35,535
It ends whenever you want it to.

1091
01:14:35,709 --> 01:14:38,303
- Just tell us where he is.
- I don't know.

1092
01:15:14,982 --> 01:15:17,382
<i>I'd always known</i>
<i>what I wanted to do with my life...</i>

1093
01:15:17,551 --> 01:15:22,750
<i>...and in 2015 I starred in my first film</i>,
The Salt Flats.

1094
01:15:24,091 --> 01:15:27,720
<i>It was the most important role of my life.</i>
<i>Not because of my career...</i>

1095
01:15:27,895 --> 01:15:29,886
<i>...but because that was how I met Ruth.</i>

1096
01:15:32,233 --> 01:15:33,825
<i>The first time we kissed...</i>

1097
01:15:34,502 --> 01:15:38,768
<i>...I knew I never wanted to kiss</i>
<i>any other lips but hers again.</i>

1098
01:15:45,212 --> 01:15:48,045
<i>We moved to a small flat</i>
<i>in London together.</i>

1099
01:15:48,215 --> 01:15:50,740
<i>She grew Scarlet Carsons for me</i>
<i>in our window box...</i>

1100
01:15:51,752 --> 01:15:54,482
<i>...and our place always smelt of roses.</i>

1101
01:15:56,390 --> 01:15:58,984
<i>Those were the best years of my life.</i>

1102
01:16:02,696 --> 01:16:07,133
<i>But America's war grew worse and worse</i>,
<i>and eventually came to London.</i>

1103
01:16:07,301 --> 01:16:10,429
The bill proposed by the Undersecretary
for Defense, Adam Sutler...

1104
01:16:10,604 --> 01:16:13,539
...to close the remaining tube stations
passed with...

1105
01:16:13,707 --> 01:16:16,540
<i>After that, there were no roses anymore.</i>

1106
01:16:17,144 --> 01:16:18,441
<i>Not for anyone.</i>

1107
01:16:18,612 --> 01:16:20,705
You won't last much longer.

1108
01:16:20,881 --> 01:16:22,542
You're gonna die here.

1109
01:16:22,716 --> 01:16:25,776
Why protect someone
who doesn't give a shit about you?

1110
01:16:36,630 --> 01:16:39,997
<i>I remember how the meaning of words</i>
<i>began to change.</i>

1111
01:16:41,202 --> 01:16:46,697
<i>How unfamiliar words like "collateral"</i>
<i>and "rendition" became frightening...</i>

1112
01:16:47,341 --> 01:16:52,142
<i>...while things like "Norsefire" and the</i>
<i>"Articles of Allegiance" became powerful.</i>

1113
01:16:52,580 --> 01:16:56,038
<i>I remember how "different"</i>
<i>became dangerous.</i>

1114
01:16:56,217 --> 01:16:58,742
<i>I still don't understand it...</i>

1115
01:16:58,919 --> 01:17:00,978
<i>...why they hate us so much.</i>

1116
01:17:06,827 --> 01:17:09,421
<i>They took Ruth</i>
<i>while she was out buying food.</i>

1117
01:17:12,132 --> 01:17:14,726
<i>I've never cried so hard in my life.</i>

1118
01:17:16,337 --> 01:17:18,498
<i>It wasn't long till they came for me.</i>

1119
01:17:26,313 --> 01:17:30,340
<i>It seems strange that my life should end</i>
<i>in such a terrible place.</i>

1120
01:17:30,517 --> 01:17:35,921
<i>But for three years</i>,
<i>I had roses and apologized to no one.</i>

1121
01:17:38,759 --> 01:17:40,351
<i>I shall die here.</i>

1122
01:17:40,527 --> 01:17:44,054
<i>Every inch of me shall perish.</i>

1123
01:17:44,231 --> 01:17:45,926
<i>Every inch...</i>

1124
01:17:46,533 --> 01:17:47,795
<i>...but one.</i>

1125
01:17:51,939 --> 01:17:53,600
<i>An inch.</i>

1126
01:17:54,375 --> 01:17:56,935
<i>It is small, and it is fragile...</i>

1127
01:17:57,111 --> 01:18:00,808
<i>...and it is the only thing</i>
<i>in the world worth having.</i>

1128
01:18:00,981 --> 01:18:06,078
<i>We must never lose it or give it away.</i>
<i>We must never let them take it from us.</i>

1129
01:18:06,854 --> 01:18:11,223
<i>I hope that, whoever you are</i>,
<i>you escape this place.</i>

1130
01:18:11,392 --> 01:18:14,589
<i>I hope that the world turns</i>
<i>and that things get better.</i>

1131
01:18:16,096 --> 01:18:19,691
<i>But what I hope most of all</i>
<i>is that you understand what I mean...</i>

1132
01:18:19,867 --> 01:18:23,064
<i>...when I tell you that</i>
<i>even though I do not know you...</i>

1133
01:18:23,237 --> 01:18:25,967
<i>...and even though</i>
<i>I may never meet you...</i>

1134
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:29,405
<i>...laugh with you, cry with you...</i>

1135
01:18:29,576 --> 01:18:31,510
<i>...or kiss you...</i>

1136
01:18:31,945 --> 01:18:33,776
<i>...I love you.</i>

1137
01:18:33,947 --> 01:18:36,472
<i>With all my heart...</i>

1138
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:38,684
<i>...I love you.</i>

1139
01:18:40,321 --> 01:18:41,754
<i>Valerie.</i>

1140
01:18:54,468 --> 01:18:59,201
I'm instructed to inform you that you
have been convicted by special tribunal...

1141
01:18:59,373 --> 01:19:04,333
...and that unless you are ready to offer
your cooperation, you are to be executed.

1142
01:19:04,511 --> 01:19:08,277
Do you understand what I'm telling you?

1143
01:19:09,316 --> 01:19:12,114
- Yes.
- Are you ready to cooperate?

1144
01:19:15,289 --> 01:19:18,190
- No.
- Very well.

1145
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:23,024
Escort Miss Hammond back to her cell.

1146
01:19:24,164 --> 01:19:25,654
Arrange a detail of six men...

1147
01:19:25,833 --> 01:19:28,802
...and take her out behind
the chemical shed and shoot her.

1148
01:19:44,785 --> 01:19:46,047
It's time.

1149
01:19:47,755 --> 01:19:49,154
I'm ready.

1150
01:19:50,858 --> 01:19:53,588
Look, all they want
is one little piece of information.

1151
01:19:53,761 --> 01:19:56,025
Just give them something, anything.

1152
01:19:56,964 --> 01:19:58,397
Thank you...

1153
01:19:58,565 --> 01:20:01,557
...but I'd rather die
behind the chemical sheds.

1154
01:20:01,735 --> 01:20:06,035
Then you have no fear anymore.
You're completely free.

1155
01:20:12,146 --> 01:20:13,374
What?

1156
01:21:37,631 --> 01:21:39,121
Hello, Evey.

1157
01:21:40,701 --> 01:21:41,963
You.

1158
01:21:44,137 --> 01:21:46,970
- It was you?
- Yeah.

1159
01:21:47,374 --> 01:21:49,069
That wasn't real?

1160
01:21:51,512 --> 01:21:55,505
- Is Gordon...?
- I'm sorry, but Mr. Deitrich's dead.

1161
01:21:55,716 --> 01:21:57,115
I thought they'd arrest him...

1162
01:21:57,284 --> 01:22:00,549
...but when they found a Koran
in his house, they had him executed.

1163
01:22:01,188 --> 01:22:02,712
Oh, God.

1164
01:22:03,390 --> 01:22:06,951
- Fortunately, I got to you before they did.
- You got to me?

1165
01:22:08,695 --> 01:22:10,526
You did this to me?

1166
01:22:12,132 --> 01:22:13,565
You cut my hair?

1167
01:22:15,202 --> 01:22:16,499
You tortured me?

1168
01:22:17,337 --> 01:22:19,168
You tortured me.

1169
01:22:20,707 --> 01:22:21,935
Why?

1170
01:22:23,110 --> 01:22:27,547
You said you wanted to live without fear.
I wish there'd been an easier way...

1171
01:22:27,714 --> 01:22:29,773
...but there wasn't.
- Oh, my God.

1172
01:22:29,950 --> 01:22:31,850
I know you may never forgive me...

1173
01:22:32,419 --> 01:22:35,081
...but nor will you understand
how hard it was for me.

1174
01:22:35,255 --> 01:22:38,315
Every day, I saw in myself
everything you see in me now.

1175
01:22:38,725 --> 01:22:40,886
Every day, I wanted to end it.

1176
01:22:41,061 --> 01:22:44,656
But each time you refused to give in,
I knew I couldn't.

1177
01:22:44,831 --> 01:22:47,561
You're sick! You're evil!

1178
01:22:48,201 --> 01:22:51,193
You could have ended it.
You could have given in, but you didn't.

1179
01:22:51,905 --> 01:22:54,339
- Why?
- Leave me alone! I hate you!

1180
01:22:54,541 --> 01:22:58,068
That's it! See, at first,
I thought it was hate too.

1181
01:22:58,245 --> 01:23:00,805
Hate was all I knew.
It built my world, imprisoned me...

1182
01:23:00,981 --> 01:23:03,472
...taught me how to eat,
how to drink, how to breathe.

1183
01:23:03,650 --> 01:23:07,211
I thought I'd die
with all the hate in my veins.

1184
01:23:07,387 --> 01:23:09,321
But then something happened.

1185
01:23:09,489 --> 01:23:11,889
It happened to me
just as it happened to you.

1186
01:23:12,059 --> 01:23:14,926
Shut up! I don't want to hear your lies!

1187
01:23:15,095 --> 01:23:18,861
Your own father said
that artists use lies to tell the truth.

1188
01:23:19,032 --> 01:23:20,795
Yes, I created a lie.

1189
01:23:20,968 --> 01:23:24,563
But because you believed it,
you found something true about yourself.

1190
01:23:24,738 --> 01:23:28,139
- No.
- What was true in that cell is true now.

1191
01:23:28,308 --> 01:23:31,368
What you felt in there
has nothing to do with me.

1192
01:23:31,545 --> 01:23:34,139
I can't feel anything anymore!

1193
01:23:34,314 --> 01:23:38,045
Don't run from it, Evey.
You've been running all your life.

1194
01:23:39,219 --> 01:23:41,016
I can't... Can't breathe.

1195
01:23:41,555 --> 01:23:45,889
Asthma. When I was little...

1196
01:23:47,961 --> 01:23:49,553
Listen to me, Evey.

1197
01:23:50,230 --> 01:23:53,324
This may be the most important moment
of your life. Commit to it.

1198
01:23:55,402 --> 01:23:58,929
They took your parents from you.
They took your brother from you.

1199
01:23:59,906 --> 01:24:04,969
They put you in a cell and took everything
they could take except your life.

1200
01:24:05,145 --> 01:24:08,046
And you believed that was all
there was, didn't you?

1201
01:24:08,215 --> 01:24:10,945
The only thing you had left
was your life, but it wasn't.

1202
01:24:11,118 --> 01:24:14,781
- Oh, please.
- You found something else.

1203
01:24:14,955 --> 01:24:18,789
In that cell, you found something
that mattered more to you than life.

1204
01:24:18,959 --> 01:24:22,292
When they threatened to kill you
unless you gave what they wanted...

1205
01:24:23,230 --> 01:24:25,323
...you told them you'd rather die.

1206
01:24:25,899 --> 01:24:27,423
You faced your death, Evey.

1207
01:24:27,868 --> 01:24:30,564
You were calm. You were still.

1208
01:24:30,737 --> 01:24:33,137
Try to feel now what you felt then.

1209
01:24:39,312 --> 01:24:41,280
Oh, God.

1210
01:24:43,784 --> 01:24:45,115
I felt...

1211
01:24:45,786 --> 01:24:47,219
Yes?

1212
01:24:49,156 --> 01:24:50,987
I'm dizzy.

1213
01:24:51,158 --> 01:24:53,251
I need air.

1214
01:24:53,427 --> 01:24:56,658
Please, I need to be outside.

1215
01:24:56,830 --> 01:24:58,889
There's a lift.
It'll take us to the roof.

1216
01:25:17,484 --> 01:25:18,951
God is in the rain.

1217
01:26:23,717 --> 01:26:25,150
V.

1218
01:26:26,186 --> 01:26:27,653
I'm leaving.

1219
01:26:30,090 --> 01:26:33,651
There are 872 songs in here.

1220
01:26:34,561 --> 01:26:37,724
I've listened to them all,
but I've never danced to any of them.

1221
01:26:37,898 --> 01:26:41,026
- Did you hear me?
- Yes.

1222
01:26:41,201 --> 01:26:42,668
I can't stay here.

1223
01:26:44,204 --> 01:26:45,728
I know.

1224
01:26:47,007 --> 01:26:50,443
Well, you won't find
any more locked doors here.

1225
01:26:51,411 --> 01:26:53,572
I thought about keeping this...

1226
01:26:53,747 --> 01:26:57,239
...but it didn't seem right,
knowing you wrote it.

1227
01:27:03,256 --> 01:27:04,689
I didn't.

1228
01:27:06,827 --> 01:27:08,920
May I show you something
before you go?

1229
01:27:19,673 --> 01:27:22,267
- She was real.
- Yes.

1230
01:27:22,442 --> 01:27:24,171
She's beautiful.

1231
01:27:25,312 --> 01:27:27,473
- Did you know her?
- No.

1232
01:27:27,848 --> 01:27:30,316
She wrote the letter
just before she died.

1233
01:27:30,483 --> 01:27:33,350
And I delivered it to you
as it had been delivered to me.

1234
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:35,449
Then it really happened, didn't it?

1235
01:27:36,156 --> 01:27:38,681
- Yes.
- You were in the cell next to her.

1236
01:27:41,328 --> 01:27:43,888
And that's what this is all about.

1237
01:27:44,064 --> 01:27:47,158
You're getting back at them
for what they did to her.

1238
01:27:47,801 --> 01:27:51,032
- And to you.
- What was done to me created me.

1239
01:27:51,204 --> 01:27:53,104
It's a basic principle of the universe...

1240
01:27:53,273 --> 01:27:56,208
...that every action will create
an equal and opposing reaction.

1241
01:27:56,376 --> 01:27:57,775
Is that how you see it?

1242
01:27:57,944 --> 01:28:00,412
- Like an equation?
- What was done to me was monstrous.

1243
01:28:00,580 --> 01:28:02,639
And they created a monster.

1244
01:28:13,226 --> 01:28:16,320
- Do you know where you'll go?
- No.

1245
01:28:17,364 --> 01:28:19,992
That would have scared me before...

1246
01:28:20,166 --> 01:28:21,861
...but I suppose I should thank you.

1247
01:28:33,446 --> 01:28:35,073
Thank you.

1248
01:28:37,617 --> 01:28:39,209
Goodbye.

1249
01:28:41,388 --> 01:28:43,083
Evey...

1250
01:28:44,090 --> 01:28:47,059
...may I ask you for something?

1251
01:28:47,227 --> 01:28:52,028
If I had one wish, I would wish
to see you again, if only once...

1252
01:28:52,232 --> 01:28:53,927
...before the 5th.

1253
01:28:56,369 --> 01:28:58,837
- All right.
- Thank you.

1254
01:29:20,994 --> 01:29:23,792
Chancellor, I know no one seems
to want to discuss this...

1255
01:29:23,964 --> 01:29:26,398
...but if we're to be prepared
for any eventuality...

1256
01:29:26,566 --> 01:29:29,467
...then it can't be ignored any longer.

1257
01:29:29,636 --> 01:29:34,164
The red report in front of you has been
vetted by several demolition specialists.

1258
01:29:34,341 --> 01:29:35,774
Now, it concludes that...

1259
01:29:35,942 --> 01:29:39,343
...the most logical delivery system
for the terrorist to use...

1260
01:29:39,512 --> 01:29:41,912
...would be an airborne attack.

1261
01:29:42,082 --> 01:29:43,709
A separate report has been filed...

1262
01:29:43,883 --> 01:29:47,717
...suggesting a train, despite the fact
that the tunnels surrounding Parliament...

1263
01:29:47,887 --> 01:29:49,445
...have been sealed shut.

1264
01:29:49,622 --> 01:29:51,590
<i>Who filed that report?</i>

1265
01:29:52,759 --> 01:29:54,317
Chief Inspector Finch.

1266
01:29:54,494 --> 01:29:57,395
<i>Do you have any evidence</i>
<i>to support this conclusion, Mr. Finch?</i>

1267
01:29:57,597 --> 01:30:00,122
No, sir. Just a feeling.

1268
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:02,268
<i>If I am sure of anything, inspector...</i>

1269
01:30:02,435 --> 01:30:06,599
<i>...it is that this government will not survive</i>
<i>if it is to be subject to your feelings.</i>

1270
01:30:06,773 --> 01:30:09,708
<i>Mr. Dascomb</i>,
<i>what we need right now...</i>

1271
01:30:09,876 --> 01:30:12,936
<i>...is a clear message</i>
<i>to the people of this country.</i>

1272
01:30:13,113 --> 01:30:15,445
<i>This message must be read</i>
<i>in every newspaper...</i>

1273
01:30:15,615 --> 01:30:18,140
<i>...heard on every radio</i>,
<i>seen on every television.</i>

1274
01:30:18,318 --> 01:30:22,345
<i>This message must resound</i>
<i>throughout the entire InterLink!</i>

1275
01:30:22,522 --> 01:30:25,923
<i>I want this country to realize</i>
<i>that we stand on the edge of oblivion.</i>

1276
01:30:26,092 --> 01:30:30,358
<i>I want every man, woman and child</i>
<i>to understand how close we are to chaos.</i>

1277
01:30:30,530 --> 01:30:32,464
<i>I want everyone...</i>

1278
01:30:32,665 --> 01:30:36,362
<i>...to remember why they need us!</i>

1279
01:30:36,536 --> 01:30:41,064
<i>In the former United States, civil war</i>
<i>continues to devastate the Midwest.</i>

1280
01:30:41,241 --> 01:30:45,541
<i>Scientists attribute this water shortage</i>
<i>to the lack of rainfall the last two years.</i>

1281
01:30:45,712 --> 01:30:48,840
<i>Ministry officials expect</i>
<i>water coupon prices to rise.</i>

1282
01:30:49,049 --> 01:30:50,983
<i>Police have arrested nine suspects...</i>

1283
01:30:51,151 --> 01:30:54,917
Can you believe this shit?
Been going on all summer.

1284
01:30:55,088 --> 01:30:59,047
<i>Outside the quarantine zone, a new</i>
<i>airborne pathogen has killed 27 people.</i>

1285
01:30:59,592 --> 01:31:03,551
<i>Authorities uncovered new evidence linking</i>
<i>the terrorist organization called v...</i>

1286
01:31:04,097 --> 01:31:08,033
<i>...to the St. Mary's viral attack</i>
<i>on London 14 years ago.</i>

1287
01:31:20,046 --> 01:31:22,571
My friend inside the Finger
came up with something.

1288
01:31:22,916 --> 01:31:24,645
There were three men.

1289
01:31:24,818 --> 01:31:26,615
Covert intel.

1290
01:31:26,786 --> 01:31:29,050
Original black-baggers, all under Creedy.

1291
01:31:30,090 --> 01:31:33,924
Alan Percy, Robert Keyes,
William Rookwood.

1292
01:31:34,094 --> 01:31:36,187
The day after
the St. Mary's outbreak...

1293
01:31:36,362 --> 01:31:39,763
...Percy gives his Beretta a blowjob,
Keyes dies in a fire...

1294
01:31:39,933 --> 01:31:41,423
Rookwood goes missing.

1295
01:31:41,601 --> 01:31:44,536
Bloody coincidences
are making me sick to my stomach.

1296
01:31:44,704 --> 01:31:46,467
Rookwood.

1297
01:31:46,639 --> 01:31:48,470
How do I know that name?

1298
01:31:55,682 --> 01:31:58,674
Shit. He must have had a hidden trip
on his file at the Finger.

1299
01:31:58,885 --> 01:32:01,115
But how'd he know it was you?

1300
01:32:02,722 --> 01:32:04,246
What do we do?

1301
01:32:05,458 --> 01:32:08,256
I'm a cop. I have to know.

1302
01:32:16,736 --> 01:32:20,069
I came when they opened it.
It gave me the collywobbles.

1303
01:32:21,741 --> 01:32:23,368
Still does.

1304
01:32:33,620 --> 01:32:35,611
That's close enough, inspector.

1305
01:32:37,190 --> 01:32:38,418
We're not wired.

1306
01:32:39,459 --> 01:32:42,951
I'm sorry, but a man in my position
survives by taking every precaution.

1307
01:32:43,129 --> 01:32:46,394
- You have information for us?
- No, you already have the information.

1308
01:32:46,566 --> 01:32:48,625
All the names and dates
are inside your head.

1309
01:32:48,801 --> 01:32:51,269
What you want,
what you really need, is a story.

1310
01:32:51,437 --> 01:32:53,428
A story can be true or false.

1311
01:32:54,107 --> 01:32:57,133
I leave such judgments to you, inspector.

1312
01:32:57,977 --> 01:33:01,413
Our story begins,
as these stories often do...

1313
01:33:01,581 --> 01:33:04,709
...with a young,
up-and-coming politician.

1314
01:33:04,884 --> 01:33:08,843
He's a deeply religious man
and a member of the Conservative Party.

1315
01:33:09,022 --> 01:33:13,391
<i>He's completely single-minded</i>
<i>and has no regard for the political process.</i>

1316
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:16,723
<i>The more power he attains</i>,
<i>the more obvious his zealotry...</i>

1317
01:33:16,896 --> 01:33:19,490
<i>...and the more aggressive</i>
<i>his supporters become.</i>

1318
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:25,497
<i>Eventually, his party launches a special</i>
<i>project in the name of national security.</i>

1319
01:33:25,705 --> 01:33:29,072
<i>At first it's believed to be a search</i>
<i>for biological weapons...</i>

1320
01:33:29,242 --> 01:33:32,006
<i>...and it's pursued without regard</i>
<i>to its cost.</i>

1321
01:33:32,178 --> 01:33:35,909
<i>However, the true goal</i>
<i>of this project is power.</i>

1322
01:33:36,082 --> 01:33:38,846
<i>Complete and total</i>
<i>hegemonic domination.</i>

1323
01:33:39,018 --> 01:33:41,578
<i>The project, however, ends violently.</i>

1324
01:33:42,989 --> 01:33:45,549
<i>But the efforts of those involved</i>
<i>are not in vain...</i>

1325
01:33:45,725 --> 01:33:50,753
<i>...for a new ability to wage war is born</i>
<i>from the blood of one of the victims.</i>

1326
01:33:50,930 --> 01:33:54,525
Imagine a virus,
the most terrifying virus you can...

1327
01:33:54,701 --> 01:33:57,727
...and then imagine that you
and you alone have the cure.

1328
01:33:57,904 --> 01:34:02,807
<i>But if your ultimate goal is power</i>,
<i>how best to use such a weapon?</i>

1329
01:34:03,009 --> 01:34:06,604
Well, it's at this point in our story
that along comes a spider.

1330
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:09,280
<i>A man seemingly</i>
<i>without a conscience...</i>

1331
01:34:09,449 --> 01:34:11,713
<i>...for whom the ends</i>
<i>always justify the means.</i>

1332
01:34:11,884 --> 01:34:15,479
<i>He suggests that their target</i>
<i>should not be an enemy of the country...</i>

1333
01:34:15,655 --> 01:34:17,520
<i>...but rather, the country itself.</i>

1334
01:34:18,091 --> 01:34:20,924
<i>Three targets are chosen</i>
<i>to maximize the effect of the attack:</i>

1335
01:34:21,094 --> 01:34:24,086
<i>A school, a tube station</i>
<i>and a water-treatment plant.</i>

1336
01:34:24,264 --> 01:34:26,858
<i>Several hundred die</i>
<i>within the first few weeks.</i>

1337
01:34:27,033 --> 01:34:29,365
Three Waters has, in fact,
been contaminated.

1338
01:34:29,569 --> 01:34:32,197
Authorities are attempting to control
its deadly spread.

1339
01:34:32,372 --> 01:34:34,363
- Sent destruction
through the Underground.

1340
01:34:35,808 --> 01:34:38,402
<i>Fueled by the media</i>,
<i>fear and panic spread quickly...</i>

1341
01:34:38,578 --> 01:34:43,811
<i>...fracturing and dividing the country until</i>,
<i>at last, the true goal comes into view.</i>

1342
01:34:43,983 --> 01:34:45,416
Before the St. Mary's crises...

1343
01:34:45,585 --> 01:34:49,783
...no one would have predicted the results
of the election that year. No one.

1344
01:34:49,956 --> 01:34:54,416
<i>And then not long after the election</i>,
<i>lo and behold, a miracle.</i>

1345
01:34:54,594 --> 01:34:57,119
<i>Some believed it was the work</i>
<i>of God himself.</i>

1346
01:34:57,297 --> 01:35:01,063
<i>But it was a pharmaceutical company</i>
<i>controlled by certain party members...</i>

1347
01:35:01,234 --> 01:35:04,465
<i>...that made them all obscenely rich.</i>

1348
01:35:04,671 --> 01:35:08,801
A year later, several extremists are tried,
found guilty and executed...

1349
01:35:08,975 --> 01:35:12,274
...while a memorial is built
to canonize their victims.

1350
01:35:13,313 --> 01:35:18,080
But the end result,
the true genius of the plan, was the fear.

1351
01:35:18,251 --> 01:35:20,583
Fear became the ultimate tool
of this government.

1352
01:35:20,753 --> 01:35:23,381
Through it, our politician
was ultimately appointed...

1353
01:35:23,556 --> 01:35:27,515
...to the newly created position
of high chancellor.

1354
01:35:27,694 --> 01:35:30,288
The rest, as they say, is history.

1355
01:35:32,265 --> 01:35:36,361
- Can you prove any of this?
- Why do you think I'm still alive?

1356
01:35:38,938 --> 01:35:42,874
All right. We'd like to take you into
protective custody, Mr. Rookwood.

1357
01:35:43,042 --> 01:35:44,907
I'm sure you would.

1358
01:35:45,078 --> 01:35:49,981
But if you want that recording,
you'll do what I tell you to do.

1359
01:35:50,149 --> 01:35:53,118
Put Creedy under 24-hour surveillance.

1360
01:35:53,286 --> 01:35:56,153
When I feel safe he can't pick his nose
without you knowing...

1361
01:35:56,322 --> 01:35:57,789
...I'll contact you again.

1362
01:35:57,957 --> 01:36:00,221
Till then, cheerio.

1363
01:36:01,894 --> 01:36:03,225
Rookwood...

1364
01:36:04,897 --> 01:36:06,728
...why didn't you come forward before?

1365
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:09,165
What were you waiting for?

1366
01:36:09,335 --> 01:36:11,530
Well, for you, inspector.

1367
01:36:11,704 --> 01:36:13,501
I needed you.

1368
01:36:40,767 --> 01:36:42,860
What's he doing in the dark there?

1369
01:36:43,035 --> 01:36:45,560
Creepy Creedy. Not sure I wanna know.

1370
01:36:45,738 --> 01:36:49,333
Sutler can no longer trust you,
can he, Mr. Creedy?

1371
01:36:49,509 --> 01:36:51,670
And we both know why.

1372
01:36:52,345 --> 01:36:54,711
After I destroy Parliament...

1373
01:36:54,881 --> 01:36:58,783
...his only chance will be to offer them
someone else, some other piece of meat.

1374
01:36:58,951 --> 01:37:00,179
And who will that be?

1375
01:37:00,420 --> 01:37:02,581
You, Mr. Creedy.

1376
01:37:02,755 --> 01:37:06,247
A man as smart as you
has probably considered this.

1377
01:37:06,426 --> 01:37:10,226
A man as smart as you
probably has a plan.

1378
01:37:10,396 --> 01:37:13,559
That plan is the reason
Sutler no longer trusts you.

1379
01:37:13,733 --> 01:37:16,224
It's the reason why
you're being watched right now...

1380
01:37:16,402 --> 01:37:19,200
...why there are eyes and ears
in every room of this house...

1381
01:37:19,372 --> 01:37:21,932
...and a tap on every phone.
- Bollocks.

1382
01:37:22,108 --> 01:37:26,545
Oh, a man as smart as you, I think,
knows otherwise.

1383
01:37:26,712 --> 01:37:29,704
- What do you want?
- Sutler.

1384
01:37:31,284 --> 01:37:33,878
Come, now, Mr. Creedy,
you knew this was coming.

1385
01:37:34,053 --> 01:37:36,044
You knew that one day
it'd be you or him.

1386
01:37:36,222 --> 01:37:39,555
That's why Sutler's been kept
underground for security purposes.

1387
01:37:39,725 --> 01:37:42,888
That's why there are several
of your men close to Sutler...

1388
01:37:43,062 --> 01:37:46,862
...men that can be counted on.
All you have to do is say the word.

1389
01:37:47,033 --> 01:37:49,934
- What do I get out of this deal?
- Me.

1390
01:37:51,771 --> 01:37:54,934
If you accept,
put an X on your front door.

1391
01:37:57,076 --> 01:37:58,976
Why should I trust you?

1392
01:37:59,178 --> 01:38:02,341
Because it's the only way
you're ever going to stop me.

1393
01:38:10,256 --> 01:38:13,783
<i>It is not my sword, Mondego</i>,
<i>but your past that disarmed you.</i>

1394
01:38:15,595 --> 01:38:16,994
<i>May we come up?</i>

1395
01:38:18,364 --> 01:38:20,594
<i>You find your own tree.</i>

1396
01:38:31,711 --> 01:38:34,509
We got Creepy pinned
like a butterfly for weeks.

1397
01:38:35,181 --> 01:38:37,547
Still no word. What's he waiting for?

1398
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:43,154
Yeah? Inspector, it's for you.

1399
01:38:45,825 --> 01:38:47,793
- Yeah.
- <i>Is that Chief Inspector Finch?</i>

1400
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:49,757
- It is.
- <i>This is Captain Clark...</i>

1401
01:38:49,929 --> 01:38:52,022
<i>...of the 137th Ward at Southend.</i>

1402
01:38:52,198 --> 01:38:53,426
- <i>We found him.</i>
- Found who?

1403
01:38:53,599 --> 01:38:55,658
<i>William Rookwood</i>,
<i>the one you're looking for.</i>

1404
01:38:55,835 --> 01:38:59,635
<i>I saw your report a couple weeks back</i>,
<i>thought I'd run it through our John Does.</i>

1405
01:38:59,805 --> 01:39:01,705
<i>I hooked him. Perfect dental match.</i>

1406
01:39:01,874 --> 01:39:05,810
<i>A floater. Fishermen picked him up.</i>
<i>No ID, never solved. Till now, that is.</i>

1407
01:39:05,978 --> 01:39:09,744
- William Rookwood is dead?
- <i>I'd say so. Twenty years now.</i>

1408
01:39:13,286 --> 01:39:14,480
Goddamn it!

1409
01:39:14,854 --> 01:39:17,152
That son of a bitch sat there...

1410
01:39:17,323 --> 01:39:21,020
...and spoon-fed me that bullshit,
and I ate it up!

1411
01:39:21,928 --> 01:39:23,862
So, what do we do now, inspector?

1412
01:39:24,030 --> 01:39:26,396
We do what we should have been doing.

1413
01:39:27,166 --> 01:39:28,497
We find him.

1414
01:39:50,222 --> 01:39:53,123
<i>Every day, gentlemen.</i>

1415
01:39:53,292 --> 01:39:57,319
<i>Every day that brings us closer</i>
<i>to November...</i>

1416
01:39:57,496 --> 01:40:00,226
<i>...every day that man remains free...</i>

1417
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:03,091
<i>...is one more failure.</i>

1418
01:40:03,269 --> 01:40:05,703
<i>Three hundred and forty-seven days</i>,
<i>gentlemen.</i>

1419
01:40:05,871 --> 01:40:08,271
<i>Three hundred and forty-seven failures!</i>

1420
01:40:08,441 --> 01:40:11,137
Chancellor, we do not have
the adequate force...

1421
01:40:11,310 --> 01:40:17,271
<i>We are being buried beneath the avalanche</i>
<i>of your inadequacies, Mr. Creedy!</i>

1422
01:40:34,767 --> 01:40:35,995
I'll get it.

1423
01:40:37,370 --> 01:40:39,668
- Eric Finch?
- Yeah.

1424
01:40:44,543 --> 01:40:45,771
Bloody hell.

1425
01:40:47,546 --> 01:40:49,173
How many went out?

1426
01:40:49,348 --> 01:40:51,043
So far we count eight boxcars.

1427
01:40:51,217 --> 01:40:54,015
- Several hundred thousand, at least.
- Christ.

1428
01:40:55,588 --> 01:40:59,649
<i>I want anyone caught</i>
<i>with one of those masks arrested!</i>

1429
01:40:59,825 --> 01:41:02,623
Give me the money!
Give me the fucking money!

1430
01:41:02,795 --> 01:41:05,787
We're under siege here.
The whole city's gone mad.

1431
01:41:06,532 --> 01:41:08,932
- This is exactly what he wants.
- What?

1432
01:41:09,101 --> 01:41:12,798
- Anarchy in the UK!
- Chaos.

1433
01:41:12,972 --> 01:41:18,205
<i>Mr. Creedy, I am holding you</i>
<i>personally responsible for this situation.</i>

1434
01:41:20,646 --> 01:41:25,049
<i>The problem is that he knows us</i>
<i>better than we know ourselves.</i>

1435
01:41:26,786 --> 01:41:29,949
That's why I went to Larkhill
last night.

1436
01:41:30,122 --> 01:41:33,558
- That's outside quarantine.
- I had to see it.

1437
01:41:35,227 --> 01:41:36,854
<i>There wasn't much left.</i>

1438
01:41:37,830 --> 01:41:40,993
<i>But when I was there, it was strange.</i>

1439
01:41:41,167 --> 01:41:44,830
I suddenly had this feeling
that everything was connected.

1440
01:41:50,509 --> 01:41:52,136
Like I could see the whole thing.

1441
01:41:52,478 --> 01:41:57,347
<i>One long chain of events that stretched</i>
<i>all the way back before Larkhill.</i>

1442
01:41:59,385 --> 01:42:02,718
I felt like I could see everything
that had happened...

1443
01:42:08,861 --> 01:42:10,829
...and everything that
was going to happen.

1444
01:42:11,497 --> 01:42:13,021
Hey, you!

1445
01:42:15,067 --> 01:42:19,367
It was like a perfect pattern
laid out in front of me...

1446
01:42:20,706 --> 01:42:23,197
...and I realized that
we were all a part of it...

1447
01:42:27,813 --> 01:42:29,610
...and all trapped by it.

1448
01:42:36,989 --> 01:42:38,854
So do you know what's gonna happen?

1449
01:42:39,658 --> 01:42:42,718
No. It was a feeling.

1450
01:42:44,730 --> 01:42:46,357
But I can guess.

1451
01:42:48,334 --> 01:42:51,861
With so much chaos,
someone will do something stupid.

1452
01:42:56,175 --> 01:42:57,733
And when they do...

1453
01:42:57,910 --> 01:42:59,878
...things will turn nasty.

1454
01:43:14,493 --> 01:43:16,188
<i>Rioters were arrested in Brixton.</i>

1455
01:43:16,395 --> 01:43:20,832
And then Sutler will be forced to do
the only thing he knows how to do.

1456
01:43:24,003 --> 01:43:29,339
At which point,
all V needs to do is keep his word.

1457
01:43:30,609 --> 01:43:31,940
And then...

1458
01:44:36,175 --> 01:44:38,803
Tonight's your big night.

1459
01:44:39,812 --> 01:44:41,507
You ready for it?

1460
01:44:43,782 --> 01:44:45,909
Are we ready for it?

1461
01:45:19,151 --> 01:45:20,778
I missed this song.

1462
01:45:21,687 --> 01:45:23,746
I didn't think you'd come.

1463
01:45:24,823 --> 01:45:26,256
I said I would.

1464
01:45:30,195 --> 01:45:31,787
You look well.

1465
01:45:31,964 --> 01:45:33,397
Thank you.

1466
01:45:35,034 --> 01:45:39,562
May I inquire as to how
you've avoided detection?

1467
01:45:39,738 --> 01:45:42,707
A fake ID works better
than a Guy Fawkes mask.

1468
01:45:44,310 --> 01:45:48,246
I must confess, every time I heard a siren,
I worried about you.

1469
01:45:48,414 --> 01:45:51,747
I worried about myself for a while.

1470
01:45:51,917 --> 01:45:54,681
But then, one day, I was at a market...

1471
01:45:54,853 --> 01:45:58,914
...and a friend, someone I had worked
with at the BTN, got in line behind me.

1472
01:46:00,092 --> 01:46:04,256
I was so nervous that when the cashier
asked me for my money, I dropped it.

1473
01:46:05,531 --> 01:46:07,897
My friend picked it up...

1474
01:46:08,067 --> 01:46:10,126
...and handed it to me.

1475
01:46:10,836 --> 01:46:13,202
She looked at me right in the eyes...

1476
01:46:14,206 --> 01:46:16,071
...didn't recognize me.

1477
01:46:18,410 --> 01:46:21,470
Whatever you did to me worked better
than I'd have imagined.

1478
01:46:27,453 --> 01:46:29,978
I have a gift for you, Evey...

1479
01:46:30,155 --> 01:46:35,149
...but before I give it to you,
I'd like to ask you something.

1480
01:46:35,327 --> 01:46:38,296
Would you dance with me?

1481
01:46:39,331 --> 01:46:42,823
Now? On the eve of your revolution?

1482
01:46:43,002 --> 01:46:46,494
A revolution without dancing
is a revolution not worth having.

1483
01:46:48,107 --> 01:46:49,335
I'd love to.

1484
01:46:50,809 --> 01:46:53,937
<i>Tonight, I will speak directly</i>
<i>to these people...</i>

1485
01:46:54,113 --> 01:46:56,547
<i>...and make the situation</i>
<i>perfectly clear to them.</i>

1486
01:46:56,715 --> 01:47:02,278
<i>The security of this nation depends</i>
<i>on complete and total compliance.</i>

1487
01:47:02,454 --> 01:47:06,982
<i>Tonight, any protestor</i>,
<i>any instigator or agitator...</i>

1488
01:47:07,159 --> 01:47:09,889
<i>...will be made example of!</i>

1489
01:47:12,164 --> 01:47:15,133
Chancellor, there is a contingency
that has not been addressed.

1490
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:17,131
<i>And what is that, Mr. Dascomb?</i>

1491
01:47:17,302 --> 01:47:19,497
- Should the terrorist succeed...
- <i>He won't.</i>

1492
01:47:19,671 --> 01:47:23,198
I understand that it is highly unlikely,
but if he does...

1493
01:47:23,375 --> 01:47:27,141
<i>If he does, and something happens</i>
<i>to that building...</i>

1494
01:47:27,312 --> 01:47:30,577
<i>...the only thing that will change</i>,
<i>the only difference it will make...</i>

1495
01:47:30,749 --> 01:47:33,479
<i>...is that tomorrow morning</i>,
<i>instead of a newspaper...</i>

1496
01:47:33,652 --> 01:47:37,520
<i>...I will be reading</i>
<i>Mr. Creedy's resignation!</i>

1497
01:47:42,361 --> 01:47:46,491
You've been busy.
They're very scared right now.

1498
01:47:46,665 --> 01:47:50,726
I heard Sutler's going to make
a public statement tonight.

1499
01:47:50,903 --> 01:47:52,598
It's nearly time.

1500
01:47:52,771 --> 01:47:55,433
The masks were ingenious.

1501
01:47:55,607 --> 01:47:58,440
It was strange to suddenly see
your face everywhere.

1502
01:47:58,610 --> 01:48:01,704
Conceal me what I am,
and be my aid...

1503
01:48:01,880 --> 01:48:05,247
...for such disguise as haply shall become
the form of my intent.

1504
01:48:05,417 --> 01:48:08,284
- <i>Twelfth Night</i>.
- Viola.

1505
01:48:08,454 --> 01:48:11,184
- I don't understand.
- What?

1506
01:48:11,356 --> 01:48:14,757
How you can be one of the most important
things that has happened to me...

1507
01:48:14,927 --> 01:48:17,361
...and yet I know
almost nothing about you.

1508
01:48:17,529 --> 01:48:20,327
I don't know where you were born,
who your parents were...

1509
01:48:20,499 --> 01:48:22,933
...if you had any brothers or sisters.

1510
01:48:23,102 --> 01:48:26,230
I don't even know
what you really look like.

1511
01:48:26,405 --> 01:48:28,430
Evey, please.

1512
01:48:29,675 --> 01:48:31,870
There is a face beneath this mask...

1513
01:48:32,044 --> 01:48:33,875
...but it's not me.

1514
01:48:34,046 --> 01:48:37,413
I'm no more that face than I am
the muscles beneath it...

1515
01:48:37,583 --> 01:48:39,244
...or the bones beneath them.

1516
01:48:41,487 --> 01:48:42,715
I understand.

1517
01:48:43,922 --> 01:48:45,514
Thank you.

1518
01:48:46,258 --> 01:48:48,021
There isn't much time.

1519
01:48:48,193 --> 01:48:50,388
I have something I must give you.

1520
01:48:50,662 --> 01:48:52,721
I went by Parliament.

1521
01:48:52,898 --> 01:48:57,733
Never seen anything like it.
Tanks, anti-aircraft, infantry.

1522
01:48:58,604 --> 01:49:01,539
Makes you wish that no one
would show up tonight.

1523
01:49:03,509 --> 01:49:06,137
But if they do,
what do you think will happen?

1524
01:49:06,912 --> 01:49:09,472
What usually happens
when people without guns...

1525
01:49:09,648 --> 01:49:12,344
...stand up to people with guns.

1526
01:49:13,619 --> 01:49:14,643
Pull over here.

1527
01:49:14,820 --> 01:49:18,312
We've searched these tunnels for weeks.
You think you're gonna find him now?

1528
01:49:21,727 --> 01:49:23,126
Inspector.

1529
01:49:23,929 --> 01:49:25,794
It's all gone wrong, hasn't it?

1530
01:49:34,606 --> 01:49:38,406
The Underground?
I thought they closed this all down.

1531
01:49:38,577 --> 01:49:39,805
They did.

1532
01:49:39,978 --> 01:49:43,778
It took nearly 10 years to clear the tracks
and lay a bit of my own.

1533
01:49:45,751 --> 01:49:47,275
Let me show you.

1534
01:50:03,435 --> 01:50:05,300
These tracks lead to Parliament.

1535
01:50:05,604 --> 01:50:07,003
Yes.

1536
01:50:07,706 --> 01:50:09,697
Then it's really going to happen, isn't it?

1537
01:50:09,875 --> 01:50:13,174
It will if you want it to.

1538
01:50:13,679 --> 01:50:15,806
- What?
- This is my gift to you, Evey.

1539
01:50:16,381 --> 01:50:21,842
Everything that I have: My home,
my books, the gallery, this train...

1540
01:50:22,020 --> 01:50:24,989
...I'm leaving to you to do with
what you will.

1541
01:50:25,157 --> 01:50:26,556
Is this another trick, V?

1542
01:50:26,725 --> 01:50:31,094
No. No more tricks. No more lies.

1543
01:50:31,263 --> 01:50:33,163
Only truth.

1544
01:50:33,332 --> 01:50:36,495
And the truth is, you made me
understand that I was wrong...

1545
01:50:37,002 --> 01:50:41,905
...that the choice to pull this lever
is not mine to make.

1546
01:50:42,074 --> 01:50:44,872
- Why?
- Because this world...

1547
01:50:45,043 --> 01:50:49,503
...the world that I'm a part of and
that I helped shape, will end tonight.

1548
01:50:50,549 --> 01:50:52,574
And tomorrow,
a different world will begin...

1549
01:50:52,751 --> 01:50:57,848
...that different people will shape,
and this choice belongs to them.

1550
01:51:00,859 --> 01:51:02,793
Where are you going?

1551
01:51:03,028 --> 01:51:05,360
The time has come for me
to meet my maker...

1552
01:51:05,530 --> 01:51:08,863
...and to repay him in kind
for all that he's done.

1553
01:51:09,034 --> 01:51:11,798
V, wait!
Please, you don't have to do this.

1554
01:51:11,970 --> 01:51:14,530
You could let it go.
We could leave here together.

1555
01:51:14,706 --> 01:51:17,675
No. You were right about what I am.

1556
01:51:18,110 --> 01:51:20,101
I have no tree waiting for me.

1557
01:51:20,579 --> 01:51:25,073
All I want, all I deserve,
is at the end of that tunnel.

1558
01:51:25,250 --> 01:51:27,013
That's not true.

1559
01:51:53,612 --> 01:51:54,977
I can't.

1560
01:52:04,022 --> 01:52:05,683
<i>My fellow Englishmen...</i>

1561
01:52:06,258 --> 01:52:08,249
<i>...tonight, our country...</i>

1562
01:52:08,427 --> 01:52:09,951
<i>...that which we stand for...</i>

1563
01:52:10,162 --> 01:52:11,754
<i>...and all that we hold dear...</i>

1564
01:52:11,930 --> 01:52:15,696
<i>...faces a grave and terrible threat.</i>

1565
01:52:15,867 --> 01:52:17,334
The area's clean, sir.

1566
01:52:17,936 --> 01:52:21,702
<i>This violent and unparalleled assault</i>
<i>to our security...</i>

1567
01:52:21,873 --> 01:52:23,636
<i>...will not go undefended.</i>

1568
01:52:23,809 --> 01:52:25,106
Where is he?

1569
01:52:25,277 --> 01:52:26,266
<i>Or unpunished.</i>

1570
01:52:26,445 --> 01:52:28,606
Penny for the Guy.

1571
01:52:28,780 --> 01:52:32,773
<i>Our enemy is an insidious one</i>,
<i>seeking to divide us...</i>

1572
01:52:33,385 --> 01:52:37,822
<i>...and destroy the very foundation</i>
<i>of our great nation.</i>

1573
01:52:37,989 --> 01:52:42,050
I have kept my side of the bargain,
but have you kept yours?

1574
01:52:42,227 --> 01:52:43,387
Bring him down.

1575
01:52:43,562 --> 01:52:45,792
<i>Tonight we must remain steadfast.</i>

1576
01:52:46,298 --> 01:52:48,129
<i>We must remain determined.</i>

1577
01:52:48,300 --> 01:52:51,497
<i>But most of all</i>,
<i>we must remain united.</i>

1578
01:52:54,773 --> 01:52:58,402
<i>Those caught tonight</i>
<i>in violation of curfew...</i>

1579
01:52:58,577 --> 01:53:01,205
<i>...will be considered in league</i>
<i>with our enemy...</i>

1580
01:53:01,380 --> 01:53:04,645
<i>...and prosecuted as a terrorist</i>
<i>without leniency or exception.</i>

1581
01:53:04,816 --> 01:53:06,306
I want to see his face.

1582
01:53:06,485 --> 01:53:09,943
<i>Tonight I give you</i>
<i>my most solemn vow...</i>

1583
01:53:10,122 --> 01:53:12,522
<i>...that justice will be swift...</i>

1584
01:53:12,691 --> 01:53:15,159
<i>...it will be righteous...</i>

1585
01:53:15,327 --> 01:53:17,591
<i>...and it will be without mercy.</i>

1586
01:53:19,731 --> 01:53:21,926
Oh, God. No.

1587
01:53:22,100 --> 01:53:26,002
At last, we finally meet.

1588
01:53:28,540 --> 01:53:30,906
I have something for you, chancellor.

1589
01:53:31,176 --> 01:53:32,973
A farewell gift.

1590
01:53:33,145 --> 01:53:36,740
For all the things you've done,
for the things you might have done...

1591
01:53:36,915 --> 01:53:38,940
...and for the only thing you have left.

1592
01:53:41,286 --> 01:53:43,220
Goodbye, chancellor.

1593
01:53:44,222 --> 01:53:45,416
Mr. Creedy.

1594
01:53:47,793 --> 01:53:49,556
Disgusting.

1595
01:54:02,340 --> 01:54:04,467
Now that's done with...

1596
01:54:04,643 --> 01:54:08,477
...it's time to have a look at your face.

1597
01:54:09,014 --> 01:54:10,538
Take off your mask.

1598
01:54:10,849 --> 01:54:12,077
No.

1599
01:54:27,499 --> 01:54:29,126
Defiant to the end, huh?

1600
01:54:31,102 --> 01:54:34,697
You won't cry like him, will you?
You're not afraid of death.

1601
01:54:34,873 --> 01:54:35,999
You're like me.

1602
01:54:36,174 --> 01:54:40,611
The only thing you and I have in common,
Mr. Creedy, is we're both about to die.

1603
01:54:42,247 --> 01:54:44,010
How do you imagine
that's gonna happen?

1604
01:54:44,282 --> 01:54:46,477
With my hands around your neck.

1605
01:54:48,753 --> 01:54:49,879
Bollocks.

1606
01:54:50,989 --> 01:54:53,219
What are you gonna do, huh?

1607
01:54:53,391 --> 01:54:55,484
We've swept this place.
You've got nothing.

1608
01:54:55,660 --> 01:55:00,063
Nothing but your bloody knives
and your fancy karate gimmicks.

1609
01:55:00,232 --> 01:55:01,790
We have guns.

1610
01:55:01,967 --> 01:55:05,232
No, you have bullets and the hope
that when your guns are empty...

1611
01:55:05,403 --> 01:55:07,530
...I'm no longer standing,
because if I am...

1612
01:55:08,340 --> 01:55:10,467
...you'll all be dead
before you've reloaded.

1613
01:55:10,809 --> 01:55:12,970
That's impossible!

1614
01:55:15,380 --> 01:55:16,438
Kill him.

1615
01:55:41,106 --> 01:55:42,198
My turn.

1616
01:56:53,878 --> 01:56:56,073
Die! Die!

1617
01:56:56,982 --> 01:56:59,143
Why won't you die?!

1618
01:57:00,085 --> 01:57:01,450
Why won't you die?

1619
01:57:03,321 --> 01:57:06,415
Beneath this mask
there is more than flesh.

1620
01:57:06,591 --> 01:57:09,389
Beneath this mask there is an idea,
Mr. Creedy.

1621
01:57:10,762 --> 01:57:12,957
And ideas are bulletproof.

1622
01:58:04,683 --> 01:58:07,777
This is perimeter one.
Whitehall is secure. Over.

1623
01:58:07,952 --> 01:58:09,214
This is General Ackroyd.

1624
01:58:09,654 --> 01:58:11,178
Keep communication tight.

1625
01:58:11,356 --> 01:58:14,621
I won't have this getting any more
bollixed up than it already is.

1626
01:58:18,530 --> 01:58:19,861
V!

1627
01:58:24,502 --> 01:58:27,027
Oh, God, we have to stop your bleeding.

1628
01:58:27,205 --> 01:58:31,335
Please, don't. I'm finished and glad of it.

1629
01:58:31,743 --> 01:58:33,335
Don't say that.

1630
01:58:33,845 --> 01:58:36,712
I told you, only truth.

1631
01:58:40,251 --> 01:58:43,687
For 20 years I sought only this day.

1632
01:58:43,855 --> 01:58:45,982
Nothing else existed...

1633
01:58:48,059 --> 01:58:50,050
...until I saw you.

1634
01:58:51,229 --> 01:58:53,493
Then everything changed.

1635
01:58:54,899 --> 01:58:56,833
I fell in love with you, Evey...

1636
01:58:58,403 --> 01:59:01,600
...like I no longer believed I could.

1637
01:59:01,773 --> 01:59:04,241
V, I don't want you to die.

1638
01:59:07,011 --> 01:59:10,777
That's the most beautiful thing...

1639
01:59:10,949 --> 01:59:13,543
...you could have ever given me.

1640
01:59:21,092 --> 01:59:22,559
V?

1641
01:59:23,795 --> 01:59:25,057
V?!

1642
01:59:35,507 --> 01:59:38,476
Eyes and ears have detected movement
heading to Trafalgar Square.

1643
01:59:38,643 --> 01:59:40,668
This is perimeter one.
We have enemy contact.

1644
02:00:12,911 --> 02:00:15,004
Hold it. Stop right there.

1645
02:00:18,416 --> 02:00:19,906
You're Evey Hammond, aren't you?

1646
02:00:27,926 --> 02:00:29,188
Then it's over?

1647
02:00:29,661 --> 02:00:30,889
Almost.

1648
02:00:31,062 --> 02:00:33,496
Stop. Get your hand off that lever.

1649
02:00:35,867 --> 02:00:36,925
No.

1650
02:00:37,735 --> 02:00:40,101
Enemy is approaching fast.
Requesting orders.

1651
02:00:40,271 --> 02:00:42,501
- What shall we do?
- No response from Command.

1652
02:00:43,942 --> 02:00:46,274
Or from Party Leader Creedy.

1653
02:00:46,444 --> 02:00:47,741
Or from the high chancellor.

1654
02:00:48,646 --> 02:00:49,874
Why are you doing this?

1655
02:00:50,415 --> 02:00:52,781
- Because he was right.
- About what?

1656
02:00:52,951 --> 02:00:57,445
That this country needs more than
a building right now. It needs hope.

1657
02:01:02,493 --> 02:01:04,984
Bloody hell, stand down! Stand down!

1658
02:01:31,789 --> 02:01:34,189
Jesus bloody Christ.

1659
02:01:59,484 --> 02:02:00,576
It's time.

1660
02:02:21,973 --> 02:02:23,270
Tell me...

1661
02:02:24,309 --> 02:02:26,800
...do you like music, Mr. Finch?

1662
02:02:46,397 --> 02:02:48,388
That music?

1663
02:02:48,900 --> 02:02:50,333
Yes.

1664
02:02:50,768 --> 02:02:52,326
His music.

1665
02:03:24,268 --> 02:03:25,826
Who was he?

1666
02:03:27,105 --> 02:03:28,333
He was Edmond Dantes.

1667
02:03:30,508 --> 02:03:32,908
And he was my father...

1668
02:03:33,077 --> 02:03:35,011
...and my mother.

1669
02:03:35,913 --> 02:03:37,346
My brother.

1670
02:03:39,350 --> 02:03:41,215
My friend.

1671
02:03:42,153 --> 02:03:44,144
He was you...

1672
02:03:46,224 --> 02:03:47,691
...and me.

1673
02:03:49,794 --> 02:03:51,659
He was all of us.

1674
02:04:21,159 --> 02:04:23,559
<i>No one will ever forget that night...</i>

1675
02:04:23,728 --> 02:04:26,390
<i>...and what it meant for this country.</i>

1676
02:04:26,898 --> 02:04:29,332
<i>But I will never forget the man...</i>

1677
02:04:29,500 --> 02:04:31,161
<i>...and what he meant to me.</i>
