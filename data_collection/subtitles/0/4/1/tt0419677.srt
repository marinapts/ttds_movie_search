00:00:39,413 --> 00:00:43,096
<i> I can't be
held responsible </i>

2
00:00:44,793 --> 00:00:47,996
<i> For the things I say </i>

3
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:52,705
<i> For I am just </i>

4
00:00:56,069 --> 00:00:59,911
<i> A vessel in vain </i>

5
00:01:10,866 --> 00:01:13,640
<i> And I can't be
held responsible </i>

6
00:01:15,383 --> 00:01:17,847
<i> For the things I see </i>

7
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:23,612
<i> For I am just </i>

8
00:01:27,169 --> 00:01:31,268
<i> A vessel in vain </i>

9
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:42,991
<i> No boat out
on no ocean </i>

10
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:53,849
<i> No name there
on no hull </i>

11
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:03,197
<i> And it's not
a strain at all </i>

12
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,860
<i> To remember </i>

13
00:02:10,825 --> 00:02:15,276
<i> Those that I've
left behind </i>

14
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,305
<i> They're all standing </i>

15
00:02:24,314 --> 00:02:26,599
<i> Right here beside me now </i>

16
00:02:32,477 --> 00:02:35,066
<i> And most of them </i>

17
00:02:35,076 --> 00:02:37,857
<i> With a smile </i>

18
00:02:42,278 --> 00:02:45,924
<i> My ideals </i>

19
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:50,701
<i> Have got me on the run </i>

20
00:02:53,905 --> 00:02:57,454
<i> Towards my connection </i>

21
00:02:57,464 --> 00:02:59,925
<i> With everyone </i>

22
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,448
<i> My ideals </i>

23
00:03:07,457 --> 00:03:12,576
<i> Have got me on the run </i>

24
00:03:15,268 --> 00:03:19,010
<i> Towards my connection </i>

25
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,192
<i> With everyone </i>

26
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:39,862
<i> My ideals </i>

27
00:03:39,872 --> 00:03:44,541
<i> Have got me on the run </i>

28
00:03:46,913 --> 00:03:50,880
<i> It's my connection </i>

29
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:52,810
<i> With everyone </i>

30
00:03:58,091 --> 00:04:00,268
<i> Such free reign </i>

31
00:04:06,194 --> 00:04:10,935
<i> For a vessel in vain </i>

32
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:22,522
<i>God will forgive them.</i>

33
00:04:24,388 --> 00:04:28,060
<i>He'll forgive them
and allow them into heaven.</i>

34
00:04:31,786 --> 00:04:33,706
<i>I can't live with that.</i>

35
00:04:45,207 --> 00:04:46,670
Fancy
you don't mess about

36
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,887
with that fire, mate.

37
00:04:47,897 --> 00:04:49,817
No.

38
00:05:57,752 --> 00:05:58,703
Here you go, mate.

39
00:05:58,713 --> 00:06:00,049
I'll help you in.

40
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:01,203
I've got to go to--

41
00:06:01,212 --> 00:06:03,060
Oh, you did
well there, lad.

42
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:05,109
You've really
earned that.

43
00:06:29,558 --> 00:06:33,108
Anthony. Anthony.
Hey, all right, mate!

44
00:06:33,117 --> 00:06:34,417
Just do me
a quick favor, mate,

45
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:35,923
on the way down
to the shop, all right?

46
00:06:35,932 --> 00:06:38,132
Oh, no, I've got to go
towards Stiletto.

47
00:06:38,142 --> 00:06:41,406
It'll take you 5 minutes.
Now, come here!

48
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:00,338
Here's one, bro.

49
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:07,888
Morning, Gage.

50
00:07:07,898 --> 00:07:10,230
All right.

51
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,699
Fucking great
pills, man.

52
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:14,555
Yeah, I'll have
to do you for that.

53
00:07:14,564 --> 00:07:17,052
That's 15 for
the single one.

54
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:19,102
Fucking go
gambling, mate?

55
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,789
All right, man.

56
00:07:21,798 --> 00:07:23,719
Enjoy yourself, man.

57
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:25,985
Okay, Weir.

58
00:07:25,994 --> 00:07:27,913
Yeah,
can I have two?

59
00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:30,372
Sweet.

60
00:07:30,382 --> 00:07:32,302
Cheers, Gage.

61
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,041
Can I help you, mate?

62
00:07:36,051 --> 00:07:37,258
Sorry?

63
00:07:37,268 --> 00:07:38,924
What the fuck
are you looking at?

64
00:07:38,934 --> 00:07:40,854
You, you cunt!

65
00:07:50,368 --> 00:07:52,288
See you
in a bit, yeah?

66
00:07:59,656 --> 00:08:01,473
Hang in. Hang in.

67
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:03,010
I ain't gonna
fucking do it, am I?

68
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,940
Don't worry.

69
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,630
I likes you anyway.

70
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,990
Sonny.

71
00:08:40,847 --> 00:08:42,342
Cheers, man.

72
00:08:42,352 --> 00:08:43,751
Have any more?

73
00:08:43,761 --> 00:08:44,904
No, I don't, man.

74
00:08:44,914 --> 00:08:47,018
Taste that beer
before you drink it.

75
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,476
It just isn't
enough, admit it.

76
00:08:50,904 --> 00:08:53,008
Just seen old Jane in town.

77
00:08:53,018 --> 00:08:53,969
Have you?
Mmm.

78
00:08:53,979 --> 00:08:55,410
Good man.
Deal 'em out.

79
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,531
She had a hot
skirt on.

80
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,652
She's
randy for you.

81
00:08:57,661 --> 00:08:59,222
She might as well
not wear anything.

82
00:08:59,231 --> 00:09:00,470
Really?

83
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,193
I'll be on my floor
tonight on that skirt.

84
00:09:05,449 --> 00:09:07,389
See you happy
chaps later.

85
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:09,319
10:00 about.

86
00:09:09,577 --> 00:09:11,425
Don't get pulled.
I won't.

87
00:09:11,434 --> 00:09:13,122
Take it easy, Herb.
See you, mate.

88
00:09:19,513 --> 00:09:22,031
Sorry about
over there, mate.

89
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,364
I really just
lost the head there.

90
00:09:24,374 --> 00:09:26,382
I don't know what
happened to me.

91
00:09:26,392 --> 00:09:28,337
I just don't know
what come over me.

92
00:09:28,347 --> 00:09:30,355
Sorry. Shouting at you
was the wrong thing.

93
00:09:30,364 --> 00:09:31,379
It's all right, man.

94
00:09:31,389 --> 00:09:33,755
What's your name?
It's Herbie.

95
00:09:33,764 --> 00:09:34,999
No. What's your name?

96
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,560
No, it--it is.
I'm called Herbie, man.

97
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,482
Whoa, me, I'm really sorry.

98
00:09:39,492 --> 00:09:42,077
I'm really ashamed of myself
for losing control.

99
00:09:42,087 --> 00:09:44,068
Okay, mate.
All right.

100
00:09:44,078 --> 00:09:45,760
Under the bridge water.

101
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:46,946
Yeah.

102
00:09:46,955 --> 00:09:48,874
Let it flow.

103
00:09:48,884 --> 00:09:50,802
All right, mate.

104
00:09:58,005 --> 00:10:00,979
They spit-roasted
me on video.

105
00:10:00,988 --> 00:10:03,285
Sense of life, man.

106
00:10:03,295 --> 00:10:04,337
He's still alive--

107
00:10:04,347 --> 00:10:06,003
"Janie and Gretchen
living--

108
00:10:06,013 --> 00:10:07,636
"getting each other off
at the shower time,

109
00:10:07,646 --> 00:10:09,334
and they really want
you to join in."

110
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:10,968
I would if I had a shower.
You know what I mean?

111
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:12,761
Oh, Jesus.
I love English cock.

112
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,043
Do you?

113
00:10:14,052 --> 00:10:15,772
You guys have
really tasty spunk.

114
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,245
Oh, she's
a little slut.

115
00:10:17,255 --> 00:10:18,974
Dirty cow.

116
00:10:22,251 --> 00:10:23,491
Not today, thanks.

117
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,643
Herbie, dickhead.

118
00:10:24,653 --> 00:10:27,371
Yeah, all right.

119
00:10:27,381 --> 00:10:28,839
Herbie.

120
00:10:30,904 --> 00:10:32,460
"Janet loves
alfresco fun,

121
00:10:32,469 --> 00:10:34,397
so why not join her
as she spreads herself

122
00:10:34,407 --> 00:10:35,438
wide in the open air?"

123
00:10:35,447 --> 00:10:36,591
What's alfresco?

124
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:38,512
Alfresco, that's
up your anus, ain't it?

125
00:10:38,522 --> 00:10:40,442
Is it?
In the anal.

126
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,560
"Fancy a tit fuck?"

127
00:10:45,569 --> 00:10:46,936
No, thanks.

128
00:10:48,131 --> 00:10:49,531
"I love taking
his cock deep

129
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,388
so his shaven balls
are in me face."

130
00:10:51,397 --> 00:10:52,734
Hi, chaps.
Righto.

131
00:10:52,744 --> 00:10:54,495
Herb. Herbie.
Herb, Herb.

132
00:10:54,505 --> 00:10:56,641
Hey, I'm all skin up.
Man, I got some gear.

133
00:10:56,651 --> 00:10:57,602
Yeah, put it together.

134
00:10:57,612 --> 00:10:58,787
Let's do some
of Sonny's gear.

135
00:10:58,796 --> 00:11:00,261
You need to chill out.

136
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:01,382
Don't take fucking
much elation.

137
00:11:01,392 --> 00:11:03,143
Uh, you've had
enough of that.

138
00:11:03,153 --> 00:11:05,065
Check on your stuff
and don't touch the action.

139
00:11:05,074 --> 00:11:06,955
Don't touch the action.

140
00:11:06,965 --> 00:11:09,165
Fuckin' hell. I was
in farm today, man.

141
00:11:09,174 --> 00:11:10,509
Listen, Tuff.
Was in farm.

142
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:11,759
I'm listening.
I'm listening.

143
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:13,265
Doing me dealing, right?
You know what I mean?

144
00:11:13,274 --> 00:11:14,386
Had to scout about and stuff,

145
00:11:14,396 --> 00:11:16,051
and as soon
as I waltz in,

146
00:11:16,061 --> 00:11:17,172
there was this
fucking bloke

147
00:11:17,182 --> 00:11:19,157
having a bit of
a butcher's at me.

148
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,464
Went over, like, "Do you
want a fucking picture?

149
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:23,322
What's going on?"
He's like, "Huh?"

150
00:11:23,331 --> 00:11:24,892
Mongrel can hardly speak.

151
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:26,365
And then I says,
"Listen.

152
00:11:26,374 --> 00:11:28,095
What the fuckin' hell
are you looking at?"

153
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,245
He goes,
"You, you cunt!"

154
00:11:30,255 --> 00:11:32,130
Get out.
Seriously, man.

155
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:34,852
So I go down to club
seeking Sonny, don't I?

156
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:35,813
So I'm coming out--

157
00:11:35,823 --> 00:11:36,966
coming out back
of the club.

158
00:11:36,976 --> 00:11:38,410
You know where
the stairs are?

159
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:38,664
Yeah.

160
00:11:38,673 --> 00:11:39,785
Was on me phone.

161
00:11:39,794 --> 00:11:41,418
Next minute, "Aah,"
he's right there.

162
00:11:41,428 --> 00:11:43,148
I'm fucking
like a ghost, man.

163
00:11:43,158 --> 00:11:44,782
What that?

164
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:45,966
Faint now, dead.
Know what I mean?

165
00:11:45,976 --> 00:11:47,440
So I faint now.
Know what I mean?

166
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,497
Were you sweating,
though?

167
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:50,002
I was like whoa, but he
starts apologizing.

168
00:11:50,011 --> 00:11:51,732
The guy comes
up to you,

169
00:11:51,741 --> 00:11:53,397
more or less
threatens you.

170
00:11:53,406 --> 00:11:54,646
Then he jumps
out on you

171
00:11:54,656 --> 00:11:56,536
going to fucking work,
and you shake his hand?

172
00:11:56,545 --> 00:11:57,978
That's what I mean.
Freaky, innit?

173
00:11:57,988 --> 00:11:58,938
No, you're
fucking freaky.

174
00:11:58,948 --> 00:12:01,052
You know what
I think it is?

175
00:12:01,062 --> 00:12:03,230
I've been racking me
brains all bastard day.

176
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,728
Yeah, it's a local
lunatic, innit?

177
00:12:05,738 --> 00:12:08,300
Hey, Tuff.
Anthony's brother.

178
00:12:14,642 --> 00:12:17,008
It was Anthony's
brother, man.

179
00:12:32,611 --> 00:12:34,913
Stop it!
Don't crowd him.

180
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:36,574
Don't crowd him,
all right?

181
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:37,983
You're making him
nervous.

182
00:12:37,992 --> 00:12:39,263
I know you got to go,

183
00:12:39,272 --> 00:12:41,474
but let me just say
one thing, all right?

184
00:12:41,483 --> 00:12:43,011
I don't mind.

185
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,157
I just don't like when
people are just fucking rude.

186
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:46,374
You know what I'm saying?

187
00:12:46,384 --> 00:12:49,352
I'm sorry I hit you before.
I didn't mean to.

188
00:12:49,362 --> 00:12:51,210
Yeah? There's no
blood, is there?

189
00:12:51,219 --> 00:12:54,482
Huh? Huh?

190
00:12:54,492 --> 00:12:55,887
Yeah!

191
00:12:55,897 --> 00:12:57,456
That isn't a bloodstain.

192
00:12:57,466 --> 00:12:59,538
That isn't
a bloodstain, is it?

193
00:12:59,548 --> 00:13:01,043
At this pace,
it'll give you

194
00:13:01,053 --> 00:13:03,093
the appetite
of an artist.

195
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,902
No, no, no.
Trust me.

196
00:13:11,462 --> 00:13:13,823
I don't like
one of these things here.

197
00:13:13,832 --> 00:13:16,710
Blow for me, mate.

198
00:13:20,815 --> 00:13:22,439
I don't want him
to do any more.

199
00:13:22,448 --> 00:13:23,720
Oh, come on, man.

200
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,482
He don't want
to do any more.

201
00:13:25,492 --> 00:13:26,635
No, but listen.

202
00:13:26,644 --> 00:13:29,826
What you got to do is,
if you do want...

203
00:13:36,253 --> 00:13:37,974
Has he gone?
Did I miss it?

204
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,160
Did I miss
the other one?

205
00:13:41,506 --> 00:13:42,874
He's real
fucking paranoid.

206
00:13:42,883 --> 00:13:44,315
Come on.

207
00:13:44,325 --> 00:13:46,446
Keep your hands
off of him.

208
00:14:02,806 --> 00:14:05,906
It was weird in town
today, weren't it?

209
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,074
Weren't it?

210
00:14:09,084 --> 00:14:10,836
Don't change,
does it?

211
00:14:10,846 --> 00:14:13,723
No, sure as shit no.

212
00:14:13,732 --> 00:14:15,652
No, it weren't.

213
00:14:17,539 --> 00:14:19,707
What are them little
lines in your hair?

214
00:14:19,717 --> 00:14:21,213
What, them?
Mm.

215
00:14:21,223 --> 00:14:22,270
You did them.

216
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,192
I certainly did not.
Yeah, you did.

217
00:14:24,201 --> 00:14:25,889
No, I didn't.
When you cut it.

218
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:27,587
Are you trying to
look like a gangster?

219
00:14:27,596 --> 00:14:30,089
No, I'm gonna
grow it anyway.

220
00:14:30,099 --> 00:14:31,527
What are you
growing it like?

221
00:14:31,536 --> 00:14:32,840
Don't know. Long hair.

222
00:14:32,849 --> 00:14:34,958
Like Bon Jovi.

223
00:14:34,968 --> 00:14:36,888
No.

224
00:14:39,703 --> 00:14:40,879
I'm gonna have to go

225
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:42,448
back to town in a bit,
mate,

226
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:45,272
to sort some
business out.

227
00:14:45,282 --> 00:14:47,485
I don't want
to go, Richard.

228
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:54,819
You don't have to.

229
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:57,662
Is that Sonny's
stuff, yeah?

230
00:14:57,672 --> 00:14:58,879
He's gonna go mad.

231
00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:00,032
He's not gonna
go mad.

232
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,218
Sonny can share.

233
00:15:01,228 --> 00:15:02,435
Oh, no, man.

234
00:15:02,445 --> 00:15:04,388
We got to do an experiment
for the mix.

235
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,887
And you have been chosen
as the lead astronaut.

236
00:15:06,897 --> 00:15:08,745
Fucking opinion
as a connoisseur.

237
00:15:08,755 --> 00:15:10,712
Go on, have
a go at that.

238
00:15:12,021 --> 00:15:13,357
Whoa, what you up to?

239
00:15:13,367 --> 00:15:15,342
Come on, give me it.
Come on. Come on.

240
00:15:15,352 --> 00:15:16,815
Let me into
your thoughts.

241
00:15:16,825 --> 00:15:18,385
It's an interesting one,
this.

242
00:15:18,395 --> 00:15:19,634
Give me your thoughts.
Come on.

243
00:15:19,644 --> 00:15:21,140
Don't think
about it too much.

244
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:23,482
Byzantine period.

245
00:15:24,929 --> 00:15:25,881
Byzantine period.

246
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,066
I'll give you
a clue, man.

247
00:15:27,075 --> 00:15:28,411
Italy.

248
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,884
Italy?
Italy.

249
00:15:29,893 --> 00:15:32,222
It's for the Italians.
It's for the Italians.

250
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,821
But you say that now.

251
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,747
<i> It's amore </i>

252
00:15:36,756 --> 00:15:39,081
It's fucking
parmesan cheese!

253
00:15:39,091 --> 00:15:40,774
You dirty bastard.

254
00:15:40,783 --> 00:15:42,471
Fuck off.

255
00:15:42,481 --> 00:15:44,558
Fuck you.

256
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:45,994
All right, I'm off.

257
00:15:46,003 --> 00:15:47,115
I'm off, Gage.

258
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,336
Are you sure
you can make it?

259
00:15:48,346 --> 00:15:48,557
Yeah.

260
00:15:48,567 --> 00:15:50,511
I'll strut my way
and all that.

261
00:15:50,521 --> 00:15:52,886
You must be
fucking cursed.

262
00:15:52,895 --> 00:15:54,194
I'll fucking
nightmare you.

263
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,660
See you in a bit, yeah?
See you in a bit.

264
00:15:56,669 --> 00:15:57,845
Hey, take care.

265
00:15:57,855 --> 00:15:59,095
See you in a bit.

266
00:15:59,104 --> 00:16:00,376
Say hello to Sonny.

267
00:16:00,386 --> 00:16:01,465
Yeah, I will, mate.

268
00:16:01,474 --> 00:16:02,970
Oh, man, he's off
his fucking trolley.

269
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,900
Have you seen him?

270
00:16:14,415 --> 00:16:16,335
Fuckin' hell.

271
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:20,754
Fuckin' hell, man.

272
00:16:22,005 --> 00:16:25,107
Fuckin' hell! Tuff!

273
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:27,037
Tuff!

274
00:16:29,532 --> 00:16:30,515
Listen!

275
00:16:30,525 --> 00:16:32,789
There's a man
standing at the door

276
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:33,975
with massive eyes.

277
00:16:33,984 --> 00:16:36,665
It looks like his
fucking eyes are on fire.

278
00:16:36,675 --> 00:16:38,594
Come on. Come on.

279
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,302
He was still down there.

280
00:16:42,312 --> 00:16:43,295
Shh!

281
00:16:43,305 --> 00:16:44,801
He was--He was
still there.

282
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:47,400
He had a mask.
He had a mask.

283
00:16:47,409 --> 00:16:48,932
His eyes were massive!

284
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:50,598
Like an elephant.

285
00:16:50,608 --> 00:16:51,751
Well, where is he?

286
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,640
He was still there
when the door closed.

287
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:56,048
He had this big
suit on, man.

288
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:58,093
Massive eyes, man,
I'm telling you.

289
00:16:58,103 --> 00:16:59,374
You think this is
funny, Herbie?

290
00:16:59,383 --> 00:17:00,789
You guys really run
around like fools,

291
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:01,328
either of you.

292
00:17:01,338 --> 00:17:02,737
I ain't jokin'.

293
00:17:02,747 --> 00:17:04,210
What can I say?

294
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,908
I'm not
making it up!

295
00:17:05,917 --> 00:17:07,253
He had massive eyes!

296
00:17:07,263 --> 00:17:09,047
I'm stopping
here tonight.

297
00:17:09,056 --> 00:17:10,520
You're not stopping
at my house.

298
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,449
I'm stopping here.

299
00:17:14,922 --> 00:17:16,413
Just let me
stop here!

300
00:17:16,423 --> 00:17:18,142
I'm not gonna
piss about, am I?

301
00:17:18,152 --> 00:17:20,742
Get your fucking
stuff and get--

302
00:17:20,752 --> 00:17:22,672
Fuckin' hell, man.

303
00:17:24,174 --> 00:17:25,606
What the fuck's that?

304
00:17:25,615 --> 00:17:27,688
What the fuck was
I telling you?

305
00:17:27,697 --> 00:17:30,251
He fucking broke
into me fucking flat.

306
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,724
Hey!
Hey!

307
00:17:31,733 --> 00:17:32,941
Where's Sonny's gear?

308
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,350
We'll find you,
bastard!

309
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:35,561
What's up?
Where's Sonny's

310
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:36,047
gear, man?

311
00:17:36,057 --> 00:17:38,486
We'll find you!

312
00:17:38,496 --> 00:17:39,442
Fuckin' hell.

313
00:17:39,452 --> 00:17:40,436
Where was it, man?

314
00:17:40,445 --> 00:17:41,845
It was on
the fucking table.

315
00:17:41,854 --> 00:17:44,092
Where's Sonny's gear?

316
00:17:44,101 --> 00:17:46,072
Check your pockets.
Check your pockets.

317
00:17:46,082 --> 00:17:47,129
I don't fucking
have it.

318
00:17:47,139 --> 00:17:48,731
I didn't go out
with it, did I?

319
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,948
Check 'em anyway,
you twat!

320
00:17:49,957 --> 00:17:51,877
These just fell down.

321
00:17:53,065 --> 00:17:54,048
Haven't got the food.

322
00:17:54,057 --> 00:17:54,785
What was her name?

323
00:17:54,795 --> 00:17:56,002
Cynthia.

324
00:17:56,012 --> 00:17:56,898
No. Ruby. Ruby.

325
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,372
No.

326
00:17:58,382 --> 00:18:00,774
she had a break,
and it broke in two.

327
00:18:00,783 --> 00:18:02,087
That was a dog.

328
00:18:02,096 --> 00:18:03,016
She's a fucking dog!

329
00:18:03,025 --> 00:18:04,490
Spoke with her
for 2 1/2 hours.

330
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,059
You lay the fuck off.

331
00:18:06,069 --> 00:18:07,436
You fell asleep.
You fell asleep.

332
00:18:07,446 --> 00:18:08,653
Fell a-fuckin'-sleep.

333
00:18:10,808 --> 00:18:12,145
Get in the door.

334
00:18:12,155 --> 00:18:13,842
You fell asleep.

335
00:18:13,851 --> 00:18:16,473
Listen, you fuckin' A.

336
00:18:29,962 --> 00:18:32,681
<i> It's all right </i>

337
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:36,556
<i> I'm feeling strange </i>

338
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:39,983
<i> When monkey ran high </i>

339
00:18:51,486 --> 00:18:55,901
<i> I feel it coming </i>

340
00:18:55,911 --> 00:18:59,973
<i> Something new </i>

341
00:19:12,594 --> 00:19:15,499
 Never thought I'd find
another man like that 

342
00:19:15,508 --> 00:19:16,460
 Yeah 

343
00:19:33,701 --> 00:19:35,356
Man, I was
enjoying that.

344
00:19:38,253 --> 00:19:41,026
Right, Herbie, I think you
better tell him, innit?

345
00:19:41,036 --> 00:19:41,987
I've gotta tell him?

346
00:19:41,997 --> 00:19:44,106
It's your story.

347
00:19:44,115 --> 00:19:45,766
Well, I know.
You guys can help tell it.

348
00:19:45,775 --> 00:19:47,400
Well, we don't know it, do we?
We don't know the story.

349
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,548
Just tell him
the gear's gone.

350
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:49,065
End of story.

351
00:19:49,075 --> 00:19:49,975
Full stop.
Straight in

352
00:19:49,985 --> 00:19:50,411
with that.

353
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,629
He's gonna think
I'm on it, isn't he?

354
00:19:51,638 --> 00:19:53,261
You're supposed to give him
the bad news first, man.

355
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,606
'Cause you can't
do anything about it.

356
00:19:54,616 --> 00:19:56,528
Just tell him
about the drugs, man.

357
00:19:56,538 --> 00:19:58,258
He's figuring it's funny.
He's gonna go apeshit over that.

358
00:19:58,267 --> 00:20:00,238
The flat's been trashed,
it's been painted

359
00:20:00,248 --> 00:20:00,820
on the wall.

360
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:01,877
Yeah, tell him about
the elephant, what?

361
00:20:01,887 --> 00:20:03,286
Don't mention
the elephant.

362
00:20:03,295 --> 00:20:05,377
Don't mention
the elephant,

363
00:20:05,386 --> 00:20:06,746
Herbie. Honestly.

364
00:20:06,756 --> 00:20:09,057
Give a shout.
Give a shout.

365
00:20:09,066 --> 00:20:10,380
Sonny, mate?
Sonny, it's

366
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,422
like an emergency.

367
00:20:11,431 --> 00:20:12,479
Gotta tell you somethin'.

368
00:20:13,609 --> 00:20:16,161
Well, he's banging about
now, is he?

369
00:20:16,171 --> 00:20:17,316
We're coming back.

370
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,774
Banging?
What are you--

371
00:20:20,784 --> 00:20:23,144
Who's banging on
the fucking door? You, eh?

372
00:20:23,154 --> 00:20:24,201
What's all here?

373
00:20:24,211 --> 00:20:25,803
I didn't bang
on the door, man.

374
00:20:25,812 --> 00:20:28,050
Well?

375
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:29,774
Are you all right, mate?

376
00:20:29,784 --> 00:20:32,068
I'm all right.
What you want?

377
00:20:33,724 --> 00:20:35,508
Sonny, we need to
have a word inside.

378
00:20:35,518 --> 00:20:36,468
We'll have a word.
What you want?

379
00:20:36,478 --> 00:20:37,429
Well, go inside, eh?

380
00:20:37,439 --> 00:20:38,295
Best we go inside, Sonny.

381
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:39,383
It won't take long,
mate.

382
00:20:39,393 --> 00:20:40,344
Get in.

383
00:20:40,354 --> 00:20:42,274
We need to speak
to you.

384
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,020
Eh?

385
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,814
Not out here, man.

386
00:20:46,823 --> 00:20:48,673
All right,
who banged on the door?

387
00:20:48,682 --> 00:20:49,729
I didn't
bang on the door.

388
00:20:49,739 --> 00:20:51,138
Herbie, don't--
Who banged on the door?

389
00:20:51,148 --> 00:20:52,355
I don't know.
I didn't bang on the door.

390
00:20:52,365 --> 00:20:53,668
Herbie, I'm gonna
ask you one more time.

391
00:20:53,678 --> 00:20:57,513
I didn't do it, man.
I didn't bang on your door.

392
00:21:03,127 --> 00:21:04,558
Fucking pills
and everything.

393
00:21:04,568 --> 00:21:07,386
How many pills?
What are they?

394
00:21:09,405 --> 00:21:10,420
Put a few of these in?

395
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,539
Yeah.

396
00:21:12,548 --> 00:21:16,479
Do you know why people
give kids drugs?

397
00:21:16,488 --> 00:21:19,200
So they can
control their minds.

398
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,964
Because they're fucking
weak-minded themselves.

399
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:28,553
They're not even
animals, mate.

400
00:21:28,563 --> 00:21:31,856
Fuck it.
I'll just put all that in.

401
00:21:35,188 --> 00:21:37,650
Look at that, mate.

402
00:21:37,659 --> 00:21:39,438
Fuckin' hell.
That's acid.

403
00:21:39,448 --> 00:21:41,429
Yeah.

404
00:21:41,439 --> 00:21:43,026
What you gonna
do with it?

405
00:21:43,036 --> 00:21:45,908
I'm gonna give 'em
a super-duper fuckin' dose.

406
00:21:45,918 --> 00:21:48,310
I'm gonna send 'em
to space, man.

407
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:50,269
Yeah.
Mmm.

408
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:52,123
The space you ain't
fucking coming back

409
00:21:52,133 --> 00:21:52,763
though, baby.

410
00:21:52,772 --> 00:21:54,691
No.

411
00:21:55,687 --> 00:21:57,663
Cheeky bastard, though,
wreckin' our flat.

412
00:21:57,672 --> 00:21:58,656
Did you see
what he did to his face?

413
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,001
Come in and
put that on his face.

414
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:02,340
He don't even nit-know,
do you know what I mean?

415
00:22:02,349 --> 00:22:04,259
You know what I think,
he's maybe fuckin'

416
00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:05,030
mental bastard--

417
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,271
If he can get in here
and do that one--

418
00:22:07,281 --> 00:22:09,322
He can do what he wants.
He's trained, man. I told ya.

419
00:22:09,331 --> 00:22:11,115
He's not gonna
buy this story anyway.

420
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,717
He's pissed off.

421
00:22:12,727 --> 00:22:13,966
Oh, here
he comes.

422
00:22:13,975 --> 00:22:16,831
Aye, Sonny.
How's it goin' now, man?

423
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,245
Still a little bit there.

424
00:22:28,774 --> 00:22:31,487
Well, I thought
we had a deal, fellas.

425
00:22:31,496 --> 00:22:32,982
What do you mean,

426
00:22:32,991 --> 00:22:33,440
a deal?

427
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:36,200
That's not us.
We ain't done that.

428
00:22:36,209 --> 00:22:38,310
He came 'round me flat, man.
He came 'round me flat

429
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:38,949
and wrecked it.

430
00:22:38,959 --> 00:22:40,613
Put all this writing
on the wall.

431
00:22:40,623 --> 00:22:41,447
Smashed me lamp.

432
00:22:41,457 --> 00:22:43,503
Have you touched my gear?
Have you been

433
00:22:43,512 --> 00:22:44,587
using my gear, mate?

434
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:46,011
We went out the flat,
left it on the table

435
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:46,604
for five minutes.

436
00:22:46,614 --> 00:22:48,237
Hav you been usin'--
I'm not asking you that.

437
00:22:48,246 --> 00:22:49,615
I'm askin' if you've
been usin' the gear.

438
00:22:49,624 --> 00:22:51,569
No, I don't get off
your gear, we sell it.

439
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,202
I don't touch it.

440
00:22:53,211 --> 00:22:54,836
Tuff?

441
00:22:54,846 --> 00:22:56,757
I ain't touched it, man.
I ain't touched it.

442
00:22:56,767 --> 00:22:59,096
He's seen the geezer.
Tell 'em, Herbie.

443
00:22:59,106 --> 00:23:02,074
That's what I'm sayin'.
This guy follows us all day.

444
00:23:02,084 --> 00:23:05,891
We go bang off the edge,
we see the elephant--

445
00:23:05,901 --> 00:23:07,880
It's an elephant? Eh?

446
00:23:09,932 --> 00:23:11,395
Elephant?

447
00:23:11,405 --> 00:23:12,515
Fuck.

448
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:14,428
Fire away, mate.
Fast as you can.

449
00:23:14,437 --> 00:23:14,789
Go on.

450
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,232
So, at the club,
the other night,

451
00:23:16,241 --> 00:23:17,769
and he said
that and stuff,

452
00:23:17,779 --> 00:23:19,114
he followed me--
Said what?

453
00:23:19,123 --> 00:23:20,106
He called me a cunt.
Okay.

454
00:23:20,116 --> 00:23:21,805
And I saw him
earlier in the day, mate.

455
00:23:21,814 --> 00:23:23,597
Out the back of your club
when I come and seen you.

456
00:23:23,607 --> 00:23:25,263
He was at my club?

457
00:23:25,273 --> 00:23:26,865
Yeah, he was
at your club at the back.

458
00:23:26,874 --> 00:23:28,179
Same fellow?
Same guy.

459
00:23:28,188 --> 00:23:29,556
But I'm thinking
about this all day, man,

460
00:23:29,565 --> 00:23:30,740
'cause it's weird,
you know what I mean?

461
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,206
So that's when, you know,
I went to Tuff's

462
00:23:33,216 --> 00:23:35,321
to just chill out, man,
you know what I mean?

463
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,378
Sort me head out and stuff.

464
00:23:36,387 --> 00:23:38,171
And that's when
I come downstairs,

465
00:23:38,181 --> 00:23:39,655
and this thing's there,
it's right there

466
00:23:39,664 --> 00:23:40,381
at the glass, mate.

467
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,342
What's this thing?

468
00:23:41,351 --> 00:23:42,367
This elephant thing.

469
00:23:42,377 --> 00:23:43,648
Fuckin' hell.

470
00:23:43,658 --> 00:23:44,930
I told him not to mention
fuckin' elephants.

471
00:23:44,939 --> 00:23:48,036
Now, the problem I have
is my gear's gone,

472
00:23:48,046 --> 00:23:49,766
and you're talkin'
about elephants, okay?

473
00:23:49,776 --> 00:23:52,106
Just nice and easy,
tell me what it is,

474
00:23:52,116 --> 00:23:53,033
and we'll deal.

475
00:23:53,042 --> 00:23:53,994
I'm saying--

476
00:23:54,003 --> 00:23:55,275
Who is the elephant man?

477
00:23:55,285 --> 00:23:58,190
It's-- It's--
Anthony's brother, innit?

478
00:23:58,199 --> 00:24:01,366
It's Anthony's brother.

479
00:24:01,376 --> 00:24:03,755
I swear man.
I swear, it's Anthony's

480
00:24:03,765 --> 00:24:04,852
brother Richard.

481
00:24:04,862 --> 00:24:07,450
Hello. Hello.

482
00:24:21,484 --> 00:24:25,707
...and you talked to me,
and you become my friend,

483
00:24:25,717 --> 00:24:29,038
and then you let
these fucking idiots

484
00:24:29,047 --> 00:24:31,052
maul you and touch you
and feel you?

485
00:24:31,061 --> 00:24:32,397
What's wrong with you?

486
00:24:32,407 --> 00:24:34,383
You know why
your brother left?

487
00:24:34,392 --> 00:24:36,368
Because you are a retard.

488
00:24:36,377 --> 00:24:38,031
That's what he told me.
That's what he told

489
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:38,707
the neighborhood.

490
00:24:38,717 --> 00:24:41,979
"My brother Anthony
is a fucking retard,

491
00:24:41,989 --> 00:24:43,319
"so I'm going to go
into the army

492
00:24:43,329 --> 00:24:46,618
and I'm gonna run
a fucking million miles away."

493
00:24:46,628 --> 00:24:49,436
I'm telling you,
you are fucking

494
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,523
difficult to deal with.

495
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:55,095
And when you're here,
you've got to abide

496
00:24:55,105 --> 00:24:56,168
by my rules.

497
00:24:56,177 --> 00:24:58,094
Okay?

498
00:24:58,103 --> 00:25:02,157
Well, here I have
a special game for you.

499
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,688
It's a very special
game, okay?

500
00:25:04,698 --> 00:25:10,229
We play Anthony
sucks Sonny's dick.

501
00:25:10,238 --> 00:25:12,379
I put this big cock
in your mouth

502
00:25:12,388 --> 00:25:13,459
and you suck it.

503
00:25:13,468 --> 00:25:14,676
You wanna play that game?

504
00:25:14,685 --> 00:25:15,668
Or if you don't
wanna play that game,

505
00:25:15,678 --> 00:25:17,206
you can have
the mystery prize.

506
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:19,768
Now what's it gonna be?
Huh? What's it gonna be?

507
00:25:19,778 --> 00:25:21,466
You have got
three seconds to answer.

508
00:25:21,475 --> 00:25:26,276
It is suck my cock
or mystery prize.

509
00:25:26,285 --> 00:25:27,775
What you wanna play?

510
00:25:27,785 --> 00:25:30,627
1, 2-- What is it?
What do you want to play?

511
00:25:30,636 --> 00:25:32,845
I'll play the mystery--

512
00:25:41,654 --> 00:25:45,305
You're such
a fuckin' idiot.

513
00:25:56,516 --> 00:25:57,563
Does it work?

514
00:25:57,573 --> 00:26:01,220
No, it's
a piece of shit.

515
00:26:01,229 --> 00:26:02,560
Oh, that's
a shame.

516
00:26:02,569 --> 00:26:03,681
Don't go climbin' in it.

517
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,740
No, I won't.

518
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:15,276
Look at that.

519
00:26:15,285 --> 00:26:17,358
I think I could use that...

520
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:18,318
for somethin'.

521
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:19,279
Proper, that.

522
00:26:19,289 --> 00:26:21,137
It's a bit blunt.

523
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:24,028
Blunt.
It's old.

524
00:26:26,847 --> 00:26:29,117
Did you see him?

525
00:26:29,127 --> 00:26:31,103
Well, I didn't
actually see him, no.

526
00:26:31,113 --> 00:26:32,186
But Herbie saw him.

527
00:26:32,196 --> 00:26:33,756
I mean, he was
fuckin' scared, man.

528
00:26:33,766 --> 00:26:35,359
I've not seen him.
We were outside the flat

529
00:26:35,368 --> 00:26:35,934
when he did it.

530
00:26:35,944 --> 00:26:37,920
It's only Herbie
who's seen him.

531
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,010
I mean,
how did he get here?

532
00:26:39,019 --> 00:26:40,932
Do you know what I mean?
He's clever, man.

533
00:26:40,941 --> 00:26:41,989
How's he got in here?

534
00:26:41,998 --> 00:26:43,110
How clever is that?
Do you know what I mean?

535
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:45,287
He's done his flat
in three minutes.

536
00:26:45,296 --> 00:26:47,566
Sorry to barge in.

537
00:26:47,575 --> 00:26:49,258
Just want a quick word
with these three twats!

538
00:26:49,268 --> 00:26:50,732
What the fuck
are you on about?

539
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:52,814
We had an agreement.
No pissing about.

540
00:26:52,824 --> 00:26:55,728
Right? Well, who's
done that, you twats?

541
00:26:55,738 --> 00:26:57,714
What's so
bloody funny, eh?

542
00:26:57,724 --> 00:26:58,899
It's not just that.

543
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:01,334
Find out how did that,
you fuckin' twats!

544
00:27:01,343 --> 00:27:03,517
Find out--

545
00:27:03,526 --> 00:27:06,720
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!

546
00:27:09,483 --> 00:27:13,894
Shut up, will you?
Shut up!

547
00:27:13,903 --> 00:27:16,131
I'll tell him
in me own time.

548
00:27:16,141 --> 00:27:18,517
Herbie tells us
we have a little

549
00:27:18,527 --> 00:27:19,751
visitor in town.

550
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,192
Tell him what
we have, Herbie.

551
00:27:21,202 --> 00:27:23,689
Anthony's brother's back.
That's who it is.

552
00:27:23,699 --> 00:27:25,228
He's messing with us.

553
00:27:25,237 --> 00:27:26,925
If you're winding me up,
you twat...

554
00:27:26,935 --> 00:27:28,161
No, he's like

555
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,103
a commando, man.

556
00:27:29,113 --> 00:27:30,416
Hang on.
Hang on.

557
00:27:30,426 --> 00:27:31,537
Coming through
the window.

558
00:27:31,547 --> 00:27:32,978
Sonny, are they
telling the truth?

559
00:27:32,988 --> 00:27:34,420
Are they right or what?

560
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:36,502
Who'd have the balls
to do that? Eh?

561
00:27:36,511 --> 00:27:38,135
What's it say, man?

562
00:27:38,144 --> 00:27:39,160
Never mind what it says.

563
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:41,637
Eh, listen,
you pikey cunt.

564
00:27:41,647 --> 00:27:42,400
Shut up.

565
00:27:42,409 --> 00:27:43,868
What about the girl?

566
00:27:43,878 --> 00:27:46,179
Aye. Patti?

567
00:27:46,189 --> 00:27:48,422
Yeah. Where's she?

568
00:27:48,431 --> 00:27:49,954
She's a fucking slag, man.
Big-mouthed slag.

569
00:27:49,964 --> 00:27:50,915
Yeah, big mouth.
Someone's...

570
00:28:05,882 --> 00:28:06,834
You're having a laugh.

571
00:28:06,843 --> 00:28:07,795
No, I'm not.

572
00:28:07,804 --> 00:28:09,428
I'm not fucking Norma.

573
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:12,252
I mean--
No, I'm not doing it.

574
00:28:12,261 --> 00:28:15,262
Now can I go
downstairs, please?

575
00:28:15,272 --> 00:28:17,820
If that is your choice,
what can I do?

576
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:20,194
What can you do?

577
00:28:20,204 --> 00:28:21,568
Get out!

578
00:28:21,577 --> 00:28:22,654
You give my fucking
set of keys?

579
00:28:22,664 --> 00:28:23,008
What keys?

580
00:28:23,018 --> 00:28:25,287
No, Sonny! Please!

581
00:28:25,297 --> 00:28:27,845
Don't lie to me, Patti.
Don't lie to me.

582
00:28:27,854 --> 00:28:29,478
I'll do it! Ah!
I'll do anything!

583
00:28:29,488 --> 00:28:31,935
You wanna fuck him?
Huh, do ya?

584
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:39,348
Hey. It's been
a while, hasn't it?

585
00:28:51,268 --> 00:28:53,052
There's all my boys. Yay!

586
00:28:53,061 --> 00:28:54,525
That's a cute
little urchin.

587
00:28:54,535 --> 00:28:56,997
She's a sweetheart.

588
00:28:57,006 --> 00:29:00,968
What are you doing there?

589
00:29:00,978 --> 00:29:02,212
What are you doing there?

590
00:29:02,221 --> 00:29:03,398
Get him out of my home.

591
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,358
Where's your key?

592
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:05,319
He's behaving.
He's sane.

593
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:08,511
Just do as your told.
Tell me the truth.

594
00:29:10,773 --> 00:29:13,368
Ah! What are you doing?

595
00:29:37,134 --> 00:29:39,174
Not shagged.
No one's squatting.

596
00:29:39,184 --> 00:29:41,325
Please, just--

597
00:29:41,335 --> 00:29:44,047
You look your age.

598
00:29:44,057 --> 00:29:45,977
You can piss off, you.

599
00:29:50,714 --> 00:29:54,073
She sounded honest, right?

600
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,570
Cow! It's only
a fucking shag!

601
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,744
A fucking shag
with a--fucking hell!

602
00:30:01,609 --> 00:30:05,091
Congratulations.

603
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:26,518
No, you ain't going anywhere.
We have things to do.

604
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:33,465
Whoa! Slow the car!
Slow the car!

605
00:30:33,474 --> 00:30:34,360
He's fucking there!

606
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:36,868
Go down there, boy.
Back up.

607
00:30:45,357 --> 00:30:48,539
Just stay here, all right?
I'll do this.

608
00:30:56,758 --> 00:31:00,949
Hey man,
how you doin'? Rich.

609
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:03,609
You okay?

610
00:31:03,618 --> 00:31:05,237
Mm-hmm.

611
00:31:05,247 --> 00:31:08,253
Yeah?

612
00:31:08,262 --> 00:31:10,010
You know the lads had
this ridiculous idea th--

613
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:11,003
Yeah, it was me.

614
00:31:11,013 --> 00:31:13,857
Oh, it was? Thought so.

615
00:31:13,867 --> 00:31:16,580
What are you up to?

616
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,304
Moochin' about.

617
00:31:18,314 --> 00:31:20,226
Moochin' about?
In my house?

618
00:31:20,236 --> 00:31:23,274
Mmm.

619
00:31:23,284 --> 00:31:27,794
Do you always
paint men like women?

620
00:31:30,005 --> 00:31:33,620
What are you doin',
lad?

621
00:31:33,629 --> 00:31:35,606
That's my concern.

622
00:31:35,616 --> 00:31:39,834
Not with me in my house.
Where are you staying?

623
00:31:39,844 --> 00:31:40,821
Motson's farm.

624
00:31:40,831 --> 00:31:43,453
Gonna come
and see me, are ya?

625
00:31:43,463 --> 00:31:44,505
Maybe I will.

626
00:31:44,515 --> 00:31:46,627
Oh.

627
00:31:47,845 --> 00:31:50,375
You're not
afraid of me, are ya?

628
00:31:51,336 --> 00:31:52,833
Why doesn't he
just chin him?

629
00:31:52,842 --> 00:31:55,143
He's weighing him up.
He's weighing him up.

630
00:31:55,153 --> 00:31:55,587
Shut up.

631
00:31:55,597 --> 00:31:59,180
You're making me
very nervous, Richard.

632
00:31:59,189 --> 00:32:02,415
Well, you should be.

633
00:32:02,424 --> 00:32:04,400
If I were you,

634
00:32:04,409 --> 00:32:08,143
I'd get in that fuckin' car,
and I'd get out of here, man.

635
00:32:08,153 --> 00:32:10,065
I'd gather them goonies
and get whatever you've got,

636
00:32:10,075 --> 00:32:11,666
and come at me...

637
00:32:11,675 --> 00:32:13,940
'cause I'm gonna
fucking hit you all.

638
00:32:13,949 --> 00:32:16,247
I don't like being
threatened, Richard.

639
00:32:16,257 --> 00:32:17,944
I'm not threatening
you, mate.

640
00:32:17,953 --> 00:32:21,087
It's beyond
fucking words.

641
00:32:21,097 --> 00:32:23,421
I watched over you
when you were asleep,

642
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,831
and I looked
at your fucking neck,

643
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:29,607
and I was that far away
from slicing it.

644
00:32:29,616 --> 00:32:32,298
You're fucking there,
mate!

645
00:32:32,308 --> 00:32:36,783
So get in that car
and fuck off.

646
00:32:36,792 --> 00:32:39,184
You get to me first.

647
00:32:39,194 --> 00:32:41,238
I just might.

648
00:32:44,922 --> 00:32:46,097
What's he doing?

649
00:32:46,106 --> 00:32:47,348
He's coming back.
He's coming back.

650
00:32:47,357 --> 00:32:49,276
Is that it?

651
00:33:05,614 --> 00:33:06,532
<i>He ain't goin' away, fellas.</i>

652
00:33:06,541 --> 00:33:08,619
It's that simple.

653
00:33:08,628 --> 00:33:10,823
I saw him. I looked
right in the eye,

654
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:12,682
and he ain't
the same guy that left.

655
00:33:12,692 --> 00:33:14,801
Did he mention us?

656
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:16,140
Yeah, he did.

657
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,745
He invited us all
over whenever we

658
00:33:17,755 --> 00:33:18,767
wanna go and see him.

659
00:33:18,777 --> 00:33:19,937
Said, "Please
come and see me.

660
00:33:19,947 --> 00:33:20,626
Invite the lads."

661
00:33:20,636 --> 00:33:21,810
Quite poetic,
isn't he?

662
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,188
Fuckin' invited us.

663
00:33:23,197 --> 00:33:25,117
Mental.

664
00:33:26,176 --> 00:33:27,159
Where's he at?

665
00:33:27,169 --> 00:33:28,280
He's at Mottson's.

666
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,978
The farm?
Yeah.

667
00:33:29,987 --> 00:33:33,026
Well, what you
want us to do?

668
00:33:33,035 --> 00:33:35,135
Yeah, I think we just
go up there, and we--

669
00:33:35,144 --> 00:33:36,672
we get him out
of the fuckin' house,

670
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:38,759
and I take a pop and--

671
00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:40,726
Gonna fucking shoot him?

672
00:33:41,774 --> 00:33:45,161
Anyone who's got any better
ideas, I'd love to hear 'em.

673
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:46,793
And what will you--
How we gonna get him out?

674
00:33:46,803 --> 00:33:48,939
You can say, "Please come out,
I'm gonna shoot you."

675
00:33:48,949 --> 00:33:50,733
I don't know.
You tell me.

676
00:33:50,742 --> 00:33:52,366
Just say to him
we want the gig.

677
00:33:52,376 --> 00:33:53,904
Offer him some money to--

678
00:33:53,914 --> 00:33:55,825
I think just knock on
the door, get him out,

679
00:33:55,835 --> 00:33:58,068
and I just take a pop.
It's that simple.

680
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:00,315
Serious shit, Sonny.

681
00:34:00,324 --> 00:34:02,263
What are we gonna do?
What can we do?

682
00:34:02,272 --> 00:34:03,577
Just warn him or something.

683
00:34:03,586 --> 00:34:06,111
He ain't goin' away.

684
00:34:06,121 --> 00:34:08,835
He's gotta get done.

685
00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:10,175
I fucking can't
believe this, man.

686
00:34:10,184 --> 00:34:12,966
I can.

687
00:34:12,975 --> 00:34:14,850
I been awake a bit
too long, I think.

688
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,993
Got any-- Sandwiches'd help,
John. Like, food and-- Yeah.

689
00:34:18,003 --> 00:34:18,278
Yeah.

690
00:34:18,288 --> 00:34:19,624
Help yourself
down at the bar.

691
00:34:21,106 --> 00:34:23,554
Bring some up, will you?

692
00:34:31,292 --> 00:34:32,961
You know I'm
with you, Sonny.

693
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:33,684
All the way.

694
00:34:33,694 --> 00:34:35,615
You know that.

695
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,240
It's fucked up.

696
00:35:01,046 --> 00:35:02,479
Oh, for fuck's sake,
let's do something.

697
00:35:02,489 --> 00:35:03,728
I'm gonna go
fucking stir-crazy.

698
00:35:03,737 --> 00:35:05,457
Man, come on,
something, anything.

699
00:35:05,467 --> 00:35:07,027
Cards. Come on.

700
00:35:07,037 --> 00:35:09,823
Sonny, game of cards?

701
00:35:11,233 --> 00:35:13,693
Sorted. Come on, John.

702
00:35:13,703 --> 00:35:15,130
Yeah, why not, eh?

703
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,924
Might as well
find us some jelly.

704
00:35:16,933 --> 00:35:19,381
Seems like shit-all
for dinner.

705
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,255
Sonny!

706
00:35:29,265 --> 00:35:31,049
Come here!

707
00:35:31,058 --> 00:35:36,406
It's-- It's Timbo, man.

708
00:35:39,835 --> 00:35:41,754
Oh!

709
00:35:59,148 --> 00:36:01,067
Oh, God.

710
00:36:18,654 --> 00:36:20,635
Take care of the latch.

711
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:23,581
Take care of the latch!
I'm doin' it.

712
00:36:29,576 --> 00:36:34,444
<i> Watch the dark
clouds bruising </i>

713
00:36:38,865 --> 00:36:44,533
<i> Bellies flushed
with water </i>

714
00:36:47,609 --> 00:36:52,188
<i> They swell
above your heads </i>

715
00:37:00,741 --> 00:37:06,153
<i> Pull your coats
around you </i>

716
00:37:08,844 --> 00:37:14,320
<i> Feel the wind
cut through them </i>

717
00:37:16,724 --> 00:37:21,334
<i> Scraping at your bones </i>

718
00:37:24,698 --> 00:37:28,989
<i> Hold her in
the falling rain </i>

719
00:37:33,731 --> 00:37:38,855
<i> Hold him like
you've never done </i>

720
00:37:42,315 --> 00:37:47,630
<i> Let this be a moment </i>

721
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:53,520
<i> That you won't forget </i>

722
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:57,235
<i> That you won't forget </i>

723
00:37:57,245 --> 00:38:01,243
<i> That you won't forget
all your life </i>

724
00:38:07,617 --> 00:38:12,198
<i> Till you die </i>

725
00:38:30,487 --> 00:38:31,822
Good luck, Al.

726
00:38:31,832 --> 00:38:33,953
See you in a bit,
Al, yeah?

727
00:38:36,412 --> 00:38:38,332
Good luck, man.

728
00:38:40,032 --> 00:38:42,561
All right, man.

729
00:39:35,346 --> 00:39:37,359
Oof!

730
00:39:37,369 --> 00:39:38,476
Hello,
pig mud.

731
00:39:38,485 --> 00:39:40,818
He's got an ax!
A fucking ax!

732
00:39:40,827 --> 00:39:42,064
We're sortin'
this out, man.

733
00:39:42,073 --> 00:39:43,216
I'll say when
it's sorted.

734
00:39:43,226 --> 00:39:44,817
We can--we can
sort this out.

735
00:39:44,827 --> 00:39:46,227
We just need
to talk about it.

736
00:39:46,236 --> 00:39:47,618
You've got some guts
coming to my door

737
00:39:47,628 --> 00:39:48,148
in that shape.

738
00:39:48,157 --> 00:39:49,302
I've got money
for you, man.

739
00:39:49,311 --> 00:39:50,903
Sonny, fucking
nail him, will ya?

740
00:39:50,913 --> 00:39:52,600
Fucking nail him.

741
00:39:52,609 --> 00:39:53,786
I'm gonna take
your fat belly

742
00:39:53,796 --> 00:39:55,547
and I'm gonna rub it
in the fucking mud, you gack!

743
00:39:58,183 --> 00:39:59,743
You fucking shot Al,
you twat!

744
00:39:59,753 --> 00:40:01,409
You shot fucking Al!

745
00:40:01,418 --> 00:40:02,690
What the fuck?

746
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,099
You fucking
shot him!

747
00:40:04,109 --> 00:40:06,029
Drive!
Al!

748
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,461
Okay, now.

749
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:08,583
Al!

750
00:40:08,592 --> 00:40:09,735
Alan!

751
00:40:13,909 --> 00:40:16,847
Fuck this whole thing!
You shot him--

752
00:40:24,671 --> 00:40:26,591
Alan! Alan!

753
00:40:52,473 --> 00:40:54,769
Go on, suck it,
suck it, suck it.

754
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:01,312
How you feeling?

755
00:41:06,854 --> 00:41:09,302
You can't be sick
off that hit.

756
00:41:15,758 --> 00:41:17,575
I'll sit with him.

757
00:41:19,991 --> 00:41:22,063
Make him stand up.

758
00:41:22,073 --> 00:41:23,724
He needs to get up.

759
00:41:23,735 --> 00:41:25,938
Let's see
if he stays, okay?

760
00:41:49,614 --> 00:41:50,509
The fucking gear box

761
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:50,917
is gone, man.

762
00:41:50,927 --> 00:41:52,743
We're fucked.

763
00:41:52,753 --> 00:41:54,985
We're fucking
stranded here, man.

764
00:41:54,994 --> 00:41:56,510
We're gonna have to
walk back into town,

765
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:56,906
aren't we?

766
00:41:56,915 --> 00:41:59,405
What are you talking about, man?
He's waiting for us.

767
00:41:59,415 --> 00:42:00,462
He's gonna fucking
kill us, man.

768
00:42:00,471 --> 00:42:01,711
Well, where are you
gonna go, man?

769
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,152
There.
Where?

770
00:42:03,162 --> 00:42:05,779
Fucking there, anywhere.
I don't care, man.

771
00:42:05,788 --> 00:42:07,861
That's off in the fucking
middle of fucking nowhere.

772
00:42:07,871 --> 00:42:10,391
We're in the middle
of nowhere with him.

773
00:42:10,401 --> 00:42:12,217
Fucking--

774
00:42:12,227 --> 00:42:14,147
You shot Al, man!

775
00:42:15,462 --> 00:42:16,540
It was an accident.

776
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:18,109
You saw him, Herbie!

777
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,966
You saw it!

778
00:42:20,975 --> 00:42:23,362
He'll be calling
the police, man.

779
00:42:23,372 --> 00:42:25,709
Herb, come on, man.

780
00:42:27,057 --> 00:42:29,166
Herb, fucking
go with me.

781
00:42:29,175 --> 00:42:31,983
We're better off
in town, man.

782
00:42:31,993 --> 00:42:33,420
Soz, man, come on.

783
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:34,509
Let's fuck off.

784
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:36,206
Tuff, man, what am I
gonna do out there?

785
00:42:36,216 --> 00:42:38,480
I might as well be walking
off the edge of a cliff.

786
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:39,987
Fucking come on!

787
00:42:39,996 --> 00:42:41,972
Tuff, get a grip,
will ya?

788
00:42:41,981 --> 00:42:43,382
Come back
to town with us.

789
00:42:43,391 --> 00:42:44,886
We're all gonna
fucking die with him!

790
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:47,870
You...fuck off!

791
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,689
You're gonna
fucking die!

792
00:42:50,698 --> 00:42:53,767
Tuff!

793
00:43:11,832 --> 00:43:13,521
Do you remember when
you came to our school

794
00:43:13,531 --> 00:43:15,652
and did that run, Richard?

795
00:43:20,866 --> 00:43:22,232
I do, yeah.

796
00:43:22,242 --> 00:43:24,027
Good day that was,
wasn't it?

797
00:43:24,036 --> 00:43:25,404
Mm.

798
00:43:25,413 --> 00:43:26,621
You was the best.

799
00:43:26,631 --> 00:43:29,405
You made the most money,
didn't ya?

800
00:43:29,865 --> 00:43:31,136
About 300 quid, I think.

801
00:43:34,349 --> 00:43:36,582
Do you remember
when you played football?

802
00:43:36,592 --> 00:43:37,863
I do, yeah.

803
00:43:37,873 --> 00:43:41,194
You was the best then
as well, weren't ya?

804
00:43:41,203 --> 00:43:42,475
Who was that little lad

805
00:43:42,485 --> 00:43:44,301
that kept showing his arse
whenever he got the ball?

806
00:43:44,311 --> 00:43:49,142
That's Michael.
Michael Parks.

807
00:43:49,151 --> 00:43:51,764
They tried to hold me hand,
didn't they, mate?

808
00:43:51,773 --> 00:43:54,999
Yeah, didn't they?
They all held your hand.

809
00:43:55,008 --> 00:43:56,927
I didn't.

810
00:43:58,563 --> 00:44:00,517
I know you didn't.

811
00:44:01,958 --> 00:44:04,392
Don't need to, do I?

812
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:33,599
<i> When the dust
has settled </i>

813
00:44:33,608 --> 00:44:37,478
<i> Will you make it back </i>

814
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:42,571
<i> Our days were numbered </i>

815
00:44:44,942 --> 00:44:49,870
<i> Our days were wrapped </i>

816
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:53,750
<i> We fall and we're lost </i>

817
00:44:54,936 --> 00:45:00,150
<i> Through alien nights </i>

818
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,031
<i> Today's darkest cloud </i>

819
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:10,724
<i> Was yesterday's light </i>

820
00:45:15,402 --> 00:45:18,605
<i> Afterlight </i>

821
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:32,276
Now we should check
this place out.

822
00:45:32,286 --> 00:45:34,490
Make sure
no one's in there.

823
00:45:42,659 --> 00:45:44,219
Fuckin' hell,
mate.

824
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:53,002
Here you are, mate.

825
00:45:56,176 --> 00:45:57,447
Sonny, have you
got one bigger, man?

826
00:45:57,456 --> 00:45:59,241
Huh?
Got something bigger?

827
00:45:59,251 --> 00:46:00,906
That's the whole
point, though.

828
00:46:00,916 --> 00:46:03,212
The thing is with this little
fucking thing, these aren't--

829
00:46:03,221 --> 00:46:04,590
You can't see.
You got it?

830
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:06,896
You know what I mean?
You just put it here.

831
00:46:06,906 --> 00:46:08,049
Just fucking
got it here.

832
00:46:08,059 --> 00:46:09,394
And you just--

833
00:46:09,403 --> 00:46:11,124
No fucking nasty cut,
you know what I mean?

834
00:46:11,133 --> 00:46:14,395
It's proper
army edition there.

835
00:46:14,405 --> 00:46:15,661
We'll have

836
00:46:15,671 --> 00:46:16,345
a look up here.

837
00:46:16,355 --> 00:46:17,690
He's in the fucking
army now, innit?

838
00:46:17,699 --> 00:46:19,426
Huh?
He's in the

839
00:46:19,436 --> 00:46:20,929
fucking army.

840
00:46:20,939 --> 00:46:22,859
Yeah.

841
00:46:40,344 --> 00:46:42,489
All right in here, mate.

842
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:24,347
Sonny?

843
00:47:24,357 --> 00:47:25,880
What's wrong, mate?

844
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:27,929
Here's not in here, mate.

845
00:47:28,837 --> 00:47:30,044
There's nothing there.

846
00:47:30,054 --> 00:47:31,454
Are you sure, man?

847
00:47:32,776 --> 00:47:35,590
There?

848
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,611
What's going on?
Hmm.

849
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:46,095
Fucking Tuff, man.

850
00:47:46,104 --> 00:47:49,298
What's he run off for?
What a fool.

851
00:47:49,308 --> 00:47:50,703
Do you actually think
he's coming to town?

852
00:47:50,713 --> 00:47:51,826
Yeah, I bet

853
00:47:51,836 --> 00:47:53,297
he turns up in a bit.

854
00:47:53,307 --> 00:47:55,411
Shouldn't have fucking
left him, should we?

855
00:47:55,421 --> 00:47:56,820
He's a fucking lazy bastard.

856
00:47:56,830 --> 00:47:58,838
He wouldn't walk
that far, now would he?

857
00:47:58,847 --> 00:48:00,087
Do you want some
in there, Gage?

858
00:48:00,096 --> 00:48:03,199
Just put some
in there, yeah.

859
00:48:03,208 --> 00:48:04,828
Just up to the line.
You see that line.

860
00:48:04,838 --> 00:48:06,813
To the line--Stop!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

861
00:48:06,823 --> 00:48:08,743
Yeah.

862
00:48:23,094 --> 00:48:25,459
Ohh...

863
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:27,389
Okay now.

864
00:48:46,091 --> 00:48:48,212
I can't me head around it.

865
00:48:59,965 --> 00:49:01,424
The soldier here
is fucking rank, man.

866
00:49:01,434 --> 00:49:03,602
That's disgusting.
I could taste that.

867
00:49:03,612 --> 00:49:06,741
Fucking hell. I can
taste it in me beer.

868
00:49:06,751 --> 00:49:09,559
I still don't feel well
after sitting here.

869
00:49:09,569 --> 00:49:11,161
I'm not fucking going
downstairs on me own.

870
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:13,435
Got any more
pots for washing?

871
00:49:13,444 --> 00:49:15,553
Here. Put that in.

872
00:49:15,563 --> 00:49:17,213
Right, that's
the recyclin'.

873
00:49:17,223 --> 00:49:19,181
Put them up
for tomorrow.

874
00:49:22,925 --> 00:49:24,612
You may wanna keep
things like this.

875
00:49:24,622 --> 00:49:26,215
Want all of this
to go in the washing?

876
00:49:26,225 --> 00:49:28,296
That's a washing.
They're clean.

877
00:49:28,306 --> 00:49:29,450
They're not
smelly, mate.

878
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:31,380
Oh, no.
That one stinks.

879
00:49:31,925 --> 00:49:33,613
If I can only
savor this one...

880
00:49:33,623 --> 00:49:35,086
You could if you want.

881
00:49:35,096 --> 00:49:36,272
When your friends
were pot leavers

882
00:49:36,281 --> 00:49:37,489
and you kept half
the things like that,

883
00:49:37,498 --> 00:49:39,037
there could be
a corkscrew there.

884
00:49:39,046 --> 00:49:39,282
What?

885
00:49:39,292 --> 00:49:41,077
You drink those
from the pint.

886
00:49:41,086 --> 00:49:42,101
Well, isn't it
for lager?

887
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:44,572
Ahh. For lager.

888
00:49:44,582 --> 00:49:47,355
I used to do this
all the time, you know.

889
00:49:47,364 --> 00:49:49,660
Not much lift
in their bollocks.

890
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:51,589
We'll turn 'em up.

891
00:49:52,648 --> 00:49:54,757
...you behemoth.

892
00:49:56,331 --> 00:49:58,251
Come on.

893
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:01,927
Now, if you get the plastic,
you see, the plastic's 5--

894
00:50:01,936 --> 00:50:06,543
3 pence, and the glass
is 5 pence,

895
00:50:06,553 --> 00:50:08,675
so if you put the 3
to the 5, you lose

896
00:50:08,684 --> 00:50:09,486
fuckin' money.

897
00:50:09,495 --> 00:50:12,593
You gotta put the 5's
and the 3's separate.

898
00:50:12,603 --> 00:50:15,196
So remember,
the glass is 5.

899
00:50:17,439 --> 00:50:18,839
Have you fed
these fish?

900
00:50:18,848 --> 00:50:20,600
I fed them
this morning.

901
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:22,138
Yeah?
Yeah.

902
00:50:22,147 --> 00:50:24,124
Does my face
look all right?

903
00:50:24,134 --> 00:50:25,213
I don't feel good, man.

904
00:50:25,222 --> 00:50:26,974
Huh?
Take it off of me, man.

905
00:50:26,984 --> 00:50:28,831
I don't need it.
Take it off of me.

906
00:50:28,841 --> 00:50:30,594
Take it off of me.
I don't feel good.

907
00:50:30,603 --> 00:50:32,130
Take it off.
I don't want it.

908
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:33,540
Hang on.
I'm done.

909
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:34,597
I'm outta here.

910
00:50:34,607 --> 00:50:37,160
Sonny, what does
my face look like?

911
00:50:37,169 --> 00:50:40,840
Feels like--loose.
Is it blotchy or something?

912
00:50:43,862 --> 00:50:46,100
That's a bit red,
this eye.

913
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:49,782
I'd go and get that eye
checked if I were you.

914
00:50:50,397 --> 00:50:51,669
Have you fed the fish?

915
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:53,494
I fed them
this morning, man.

916
00:50:53,504 --> 00:50:55,870
One of 'em looks
like a shark.

917
00:51:59,676 --> 00:52:01,596
Raaah!

918
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:17,832
<i> Sunny sunny sunny
days with you </i>

919
00:52:17,842 --> 00:52:23,057
<i> Sunny sunny sunny
days with you </i>

920
00:52:24,148 --> 00:52:27,477
Help. Help me.

921
00:52:46,087 --> 00:52:47,583
You're the devil.

922
00:52:47,593 --> 00:52:49,513
I wish I fucking was.

923
00:52:50,763 --> 00:52:54,122
Jesus.
No.

924
00:52:54,132 --> 00:52:56,144
You a devil?

925
00:52:59,507 --> 00:53:01,427
Jesus.

926
00:53:04,761 --> 00:53:06,416
Don't--
Don't touch me.

927
00:53:06,426 --> 00:53:09,623
Do you like to party?

928
00:53:09,633 --> 00:53:11,221
Get up and fucking dance.

929
00:53:11,231 --> 00:53:13,627
Get up and dance
at my party.

930
00:53:13,637 --> 00:53:15,000
Get your fat up.
Look at ya!

931
00:53:19,915 --> 00:53:23,461
Come on. Come on!

932
00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:24,930
Have a dance.

933
00:53:36,918 --> 00:53:39,598
He doesn't know.
He's just trying.

934
00:53:39,607 --> 00:53:41,457
With a mind that's
fucked up for ages.

935
00:53:44,253 --> 00:53:47,446
<i>Did you think you could
get away with it?</i>

936
00:53:47,455 --> 00:53:49,569
<i>You fuckin' did, man.</i>

937
00:53:51,554 --> 00:53:52,891
<i>You can come with me.</i>

938
00:53:52,901 --> 00:53:54,820
Help.

939
00:54:35,788 --> 00:54:37,993
Up. Sit up!

940
00:54:38,003 --> 00:54:40,287
Fucking chin up.
Sit up, man.

941
00:54:42,194 --> 00:54:44,114
Pay attention.

942
00:54:44,692 --> 00:54:46,612
Up on your feet, you.

943
00:54:51,963 --> 00:54:54,909
Whoa. Don't you know
who I am?

944
00:54:57,343 --> 00:54:58,487
Can I go?

945
00:54:58,497 --> 00:55:01,923
Well, you're going.
You're going.

946
00:55:04,486 --> 00:55:07,140
Are you going?
No.

947
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:09,679
I'm gonna do it all
for you now.

948
00:55:12,206 --> 00:55:15,372
I'm gonna take it
all away from you.

949
00:55:15,381 --> 00:55:17,481
You just look at me
like that. That's it, mate.

950
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:21,243
That's it. You just stand
there and don't move.

951
00:55:21,654 --> 00:55:23,939
I gotta fucki''
shut you off.

952
00:55:40,423 --> 00:55:42,343
Hey.

953
00:55:43,434 --> 00:55:45,671
Sit there.

954
00:55:45,681 --> 00:55:47,812
There's something
I want to show you.

955
00:55:47,821 --> 00:55:50,106
It's just
between me and you.

956
00:55:51,312 --> 00:55:53,232
Just stay there.

957
00:56:20,203 --> 00:56:21,732
Wipe your nose.

958
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:28,978
Open it.

959
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:32,373
Open it.

960
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:35,768
What is it?

961
00:56:36,506 --> 00:56:38,426
Open it.

962
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,000
Who is he?

963
00:57:02,451 --> 00:57:04,370
That's not Joe.

964
00:57:06,198 --> 00:57:08,645
It's hard to believe,
isn't it?

965
00:57:10,234 --> 00:57:12,681
Do you want
to give him a kiss?

966
00:57:13,437 --> 00:57:15,357
No.

967
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:20,692
Say something to him.
It's your last chance.

968
00:57:23,013 --> 00:57:24,933
Are you frightened?

969
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,584
Want me to close it?

970
00:57:27,593 --> 00:57:29,926
I'm sorry, mate.

971
00:57:29,935 --> 00:57:34,500
Yeah. It's hard losing
somebody close to you,

972
00:57:34,509 --> 00:57:35,436
isn't it?

973
00:57:37,298 --> 00:57:38,314
Do you want me
to show it to you?

974
00:57:38,323 --> 00:57:40,784
Yeah...
Yeah.

975
00:57:40,794 --> 00:57:42,702
What did you do that for?

976
00:57:42,711 --> 00:57:44,631
He tried to run away.

977
00:57:47,003 --> 00:57:49,287
Do you know
why you're alive?

978
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:54,200
You're a good man.

979
00:57:54,209 --> 00:57:55,193
Yeah.

980
00:57:55,203 --> 00:57:57,123
Yeah.
Yeah.

981
00:58:00,296 --> 00:58:01,940
I'll give you a deal.
You tell me

982
00:58:01,950 --> 00:58:02,976
what I want to know,

983
00:58:02,986 --> 00:58:04,161
and I'll let you live.

984
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:06,090
Will you?
Mm-hmm.

985
00:58:06,861 --> 00:58:08,781
There's one more.

986
00:58:13,716 --> 00:58:15,595
Where is he?

987
00:58:15,605 --> 00:58:17,907
Where he lives?

988
00:58:17,916 --> 00:58:20,148
No.

989
00:58:20,158 --> 00:58:23,287
Fuckin' hell.

990
00:58:23,297 --> 00:58:25,242
That's them.

991
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:27,703
That's them in there.
Where's you?

992
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:28,759
Where are you?

993
00:58:28,769 --> 00:58:30,041
I'm here.

994
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:31,803
Yeah.

995
00:58:31,812 --> 00:58:34,273
You're here.

996
00:58:34,283 --> 00:58:36,159
Tell me I can go.

997
00:58:36,168 --> 00:58:37,825
What would you have said?
I'll help ya.

998
00:58:37,834 --> 00:58:40,424
Well, then...

999
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:41,795
I've gone all straight.

1000
00:58:41,805 --> 00:58:43,654
That don't matter.

1001
00:58:43,663 --> 00:58:45,872
West End.

1002
00:58:48,596 --> 00:58:52,402
You fuckin' lying to me?
No.

1003
00:58:52,412 --> 00:58:53,872
I'll come after ya.

1004
00:58:53,881 --> 00:58:56,566
Aye. I know it's West End.

1005
00:58:56,575 --> 00:58:59,676
You know I'll come
after you, don't ya?

1006
00:59:02,016 --> 00:59:05,791
That's why I know you're
telling the truth.

1007
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,348
You'll let me live,
won't you now?

1008
00:59:08,357 --> 00:59:09,886
I promised you.
You did, didn't ya?

1009
00:59:09,896 --> 00:59:11,487
Yeah.

1010
00:59:11,496 --> 00:59:13,729
And I don't go back
on my word, mate.

1011
00:59:13,738 --> 00:59:15,816
Honest?
Mm.

1012
00:59:15,825 --> 00:59:17,745
Put it there.

1013
00:59:19,984 --> 00:59:22,065
Eh?
Yeah.

1014
00:59:23,764 --> 00:59:25,684
Not this time, pal.

1015
00:59:28,988 --> 00:59:31,894
That's it, mate.
Let it out.

1016
00:59:31,904 --> 00:59:33,944
Let it all out.
That's it.

1017
00:59:42,757 --> 00:59:45,475
Is that for me?

1018
00:59:45,484 --> 00:59:47,525
No.

1019
00:59:47,535 --> 00:59:48,546
Tell the truth.

1020
00:59:48,555 --> 00:59:50,600
No.

1021
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:52,548
It don't matter
anyway, does it?

1022
00:59:52,557 --> 00:59:53,573
Does it, now?

1023
00:59:53,583 --> 00:59:55,820
Well, no, not now.

1024
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:57,161
I wouldn't have done that.

1025
00:59:57,170 --> 00:59:58,538
Oh, no, mate.

1026
00:59:58,548 --> 01:00:00,944
Fuck it.

1027
01:00:00,954 --> 01:00:02,766
Come here.

1028
01:00:02,775 --> 01:00:04,821
Uhh!

1029
01:00:35,189 --> 01:00:40,885
<i> There is blood on my face </i>

1030
01:00:40,895 --> 01:00:46,010
 There is cursed in my eye 

1031
01:00:46,019 --> 01:00:51,263
<i> There is no one
in the place </i>

1032
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:56,772
<i> But no one said good-bye </i>

1033
01:00:56,782 --> 01:01:03,951
<i> This is how I start
another day in my kingdom </i>

1034
01:01:12,023 --> 01:01:17,239
<i> There is hate in my heart </i>

1035
01:01:17,248 --> 01:01:22,331
<i> This is how my day starts </i>

1036
01:01:22,341 --> 01:01:27,680
<i> There is blood on my hands </i>

1037
01:01:27,689 --> 01:01:33,382
<i> From the murder of a man </i>

1038
01:01:33,391 --> 01:01:41,105
<i> This is how I start
another day in my kingdom </i>

1039
01:02:21,815 --> 01:02:23,733
Lads!
Yeah.

1040
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:25,105
Here now.

1041
01:02:25,114 --> 01:02:28,728
I told you an hour.
Where have you been?

1042
01:02:28,738 --> 01:02:30,230
The park.
What's that?

1043
01:02:30,239 --> 01:02:31,479
A mask.

1044
01:02:31,488 --> 01:02:33,917
Take it off.

1045
01:02:33,927 --> 01:02:37,120
What are you doing
with that on?

1046
01:02:37,129 --> 01:02:38,717
Where'd you get that from?

1047
01:02:38,726 --> 01:02:39,709
A soldier.

1048
01:02:39,719 --> 01:02:41,471
What?
A soldier.

1049
01:02:41,481 --> 01:02:43,526
What is that?
A knife.

1050
01:02:43,536 --> 01:02:46,019
I know it's a knife.
What you doing with a knife?

1051
01:02:46,028 --> 01:02:47,044
Soldier gave us them.

1052
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:48,390
What do you mean,
a soldier gave it to you?

1053
01:02:48,399 --> 01:02:49,767
He said he knew Dad.

1054
01:02:49,776 --> 01:02:51,240
He said he knew Dad, did he?

1055
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:53,487
Really?

1056
01:02:53,497 --> 01:02:55,473
Mark!

1057
01:02:55,483 --> 01:02:56,909
Mark!
What?

1058
01:02:56,919 --> 01:02:58,839
Come down here now!

1059
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:10,206
Come on. We're gonna
drive down there now.

1060
01:03:10,216 --> 01:03:12,764
Definitely not
trash diving, is it?

1061
01:03:12,774 --> 01:03:13,725
No.

1062
01:03:13,735 --> 01:03:15,101
Come on, mate.

1063
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:19,362
You'll know him
if you see him?

1064
01:03:19,371 --> 01:03:21,291
Yeah.

1065
01:03:44,611 --> 01:03:45,850
Hi. Can I help ya?

1066
01:03:45,859 --> 01:03:47,484
Hello, love.
Is Mark available?

1067
01:03:47,494 --> 01:03:49,598
No, he's just gone out
with the lads, actually.

1068
01:03:49,607 --> 01:03:50,687
Oh, that's a shame.

1069
01:03:50,697 --> 01:03:51,583
Can I tell him
who's calling?

1070
01:03:51,593 --> 01:03:52,608
Yeah, my name's Richard.

1071
01:03:52,618 --> 01:03:54,562
I'm an old friend of his
from years ago.

1072
01:03:54,572 --> 01:03:56,516
Was you in the park
this morning?

1073
01:03:56,525 --> 01:03:57,477
Yeah, yeah.

1074
01:03:57,486 --> 01:03:58,566
Did you meet my lads?

1075
01:03:58,576 --> 01:04:01,518
I did.
Absolutely brilliant lads.

1076
01:04:01,528 --> 01:04:02,922
Yeah.
Crackers.

1077
01:04:02,932 --> 01:04:04,075
They are crackers.

1078
01:04:04,084 --> 01:04:05,741
Yeah, they've been
shouted at today.

1079
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:07,086
Oh, right.

1080
01:04:07,096 --> 01:04:08,665
Yeah, 'cause they
came back with a mask

1081
01:04:08,675 --> 01:04:09,168
and a knife.

1082
01:04:09,177 --> 01:04:10,480
So I was a bit upset,
to be honest.

1083
01:04:10,490 --> 01:04:11,826
It was blunt.

1084
01:04:11,836 --> 01:04:13,492
I know, but it's a bit
irresponsible, isn't it?

1085
01:04:13,502 --> 01:04:15,487
I was really worried.

1086
01:04:17,216 --> 01:04:18,232
You're a good mother.

1087
01:04:18,241 --> 01:04:19,897
Yeah.

1088
01:04:19,907 --> 01:04:21,755
Yeah, I am
a good mother.

1089
01:04:21,765 --> 01:04:23,684
Good one, then.

1090
01:04:25,097 --> 01:04:26,815
Sorry. Can I ask your
name again?

1091
01:04:26,825 --> 01:04:28,193
My name's Richard.

1092
01:04:28,203 --> 01:04:31,075
And...just tell him
that you called, yeah?

1093
01:04:31,085 --> 01:04:33,644
Yeah. I'll be around anyway.

1094
01:04:33,653 --> 01:04:34,470
Right, okay.

1095
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:35,431
Anthony's brother.

1096
01:04:35,441 --> 01:04:37,743
Anthony's brother,
right.

1097
01:04:37,752 --> 01:04:39,728
Yeah.
Yeah.

1098
01:04:39,738 --> 01:04:41,658
Ta.

1099
01:05:02,538 --> 01:05:04,130
Hello.

1100
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:05,343
What are you doing
sittin' there in

1101
01:05:05,352 --> 01:05:05,668
the dark?

1102
01:05:05,677 --> 01:05:07,333
I'm waiting for you lot.

1103
01:05:07,342 --> 01:05:09,127
How you doing, lads?
All right.

1104
01:05:09,137 --> 01:05:12,170
You gonna go upstairs and play
on your computer before tea?

1105
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:14,099
Okay.

1106
01:05:17,336 --> 01:05:18,511
There's no one up there.

1107
01:05:18,521 --> 01:05:19,889
No, that's 'cause
he's been here.

1108
01:05:19,898 --> 01:05:21,715
He what? Do you mean
he's been here?

1109
01:05:21,724 --> 01:05:24,276
No, as soon as you left,
he came.

1110
01:05:24,286 --> 01:05:25,366
What? Been inside?

1111
01:05:25,375 --> 01:05:26,423
No, he didn't come inside.

1112
01:05:26,432 --> 01:05:28,793
He was fine.
He wasn't--he wasn't...

1113
01:05:28,802 --> 01:05:29,978
It was a bit weird.

1114
01:05:29,988 --> 01:05:31,676
What'd he say?

1115
01:05:31,685 --> 01:05:34,045
He said, "Tell him
Richard called."

1116
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:35,135
And you don't know him?

1117
01:05:35,144 --> 01:05:37,376
No, I've never seen him
before in me life.

1118
01:05:37,386 --> 01:05:39,138
Never.

1119
01:05:39,148 --> 01:05:40,611
But he did ask for you.

1120
01:05:40,621 --> 01:05:41,892
He said, uh,

1121
01:05:41,902 --> 01:05:45,384
"He used to knock about with
his brother years ago: Anthony."

1122
01:05:45,394 --> 01:05:47,923
Leave him alone.

1123
01:05:50,358 --> 01:05:51,341
What?

1124
01:05:51,351 --> 01:05:53,271
Hey, soft, man.

1125
01:05:53,753 --> 01:05:55,673
What is it, babe?

1126
01:05:57,789 --> 01:06:00,122
What's wrong?

1127
01:06:00,132 --> 01:06:01,078
I do know him.

1128
01:06:01,088 --> 01:06:02,903
Get off! Get off!

1129
01:06:02,913 --> 01:06:05,219
I know who he is.

1130
01:06:07,302 --> 01:06:09,222
Anthony.

1131
01:06:13,195 --> 01:06:17,675
He was just a kid,
just a...young lad.

1132
01:06:17,685 --> 01:06:20,745
I mean, he was a simple kid.
He wasn't...

1133
01:06:20,754 --> 01:06:22,185
Do you know what I mean?
He wasn't as--

1134
01:06:22,195 --> 01:06:23,820
He was just...

1135
01:06:23,829 --> 01:06:26,573
too simple to know
what he was doing.

1136
01:06:26,583 --> 01:06:28,786
Until Rich
went in the army.

1137
01:06:30,363 --> 01:06:33,685
And Anthony used
to hang about with us, like...

1138
01:06:33,694 --> 01:06:35,798
We just had a laugh with him,
we had a laugh with him.

1139
01:06:35,808 --> 01:06:37,821
But Sonny was just...

1140
01:06:37,831 --> 01:06:40,475
just everything.
Everything was too far.

1141
01:06:40,484 --> 01:06:42,108
Everything he took too far.

1142
01:06:42,118 --> 01:06:45,280
And Anthony just didn't know
what was happening.

1143
01:06:45,289 --> 01:06:47,393
He didn't know where he was.
He was-- He wasn't like--

1144
01:06:47,403 --> 01:06:50,088
He just didn't
understand at all.

1145
01:06:50,098 --> 01:06:52,202
He just--just...

1146
01:06:52,212 --> 01:06:54,659
He didn't understand
any of it.

1147
01:06:55,313 --> 01:06:57,098
We...

1148
01:06:57,108 --> 01:06:59,441
all got in a van and...

1149
01:06:59,451 --> 01:07:01,735
we were dropping acid and...

1150
01:07:03,929 --> 01:07:06,051
And Sonny gave him some...

1151
01:07:08,094 --> 01:07:09,781
And I could see
it was going wrong.

1152
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:12,567
I could see-- I could see
Anthony's face,

1153
01:07:12,576 --> 01:07:13,753
and it was all...

1154
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:17,108
He was tripping
out of his mind, this kid.

1155
01:07:29,937 --> 01:07:33,201
You're all right, mate.
He don't mind me.

1156
01:07:54,791 --> 01:07:56,288
Fall in!

1157
01:08:14,747 --> 01:08:16,667
Aah!

1158
01:08:47,287 --> 01:08:49,207
No! No!

1159
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:10,220
Aah!

1160
01:09:39,945 --> 01:09:41,504
Anthony, stop shouting.

1161
01:09:41,514 --> 01:09:45,091
Because every time you shout,
your mother gets sick.

1162
01:09:45,101 --> 01:09:48,903
And then Richard might
get a bullet in the army.

1163
01:09:48,913 --> 01:09:51,279
And we don't
want that, do we?

1164
01:10:01,852 --> 01:10:05,339
Move from there,
you're dead.

1165
01:10:05,348 --> 01:10:08,098
Don't fuckin' move!

1166
01:10:15,753 --> 01:10:18,186
Come on!
Get a move on!

1167
01:10:21,422 --> 01:10:23,751
I was the last one--
I could have stayed.

1168
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,385
I could have stayed.
I could have kept with him.

1169
01:10:25,395 --> 01:10:28,088
But everybody got
back in the van.

1170
01:10:29,718 --> 01:10:32,404
Left him.

1171
01:10:32,414 --> 01:10:34,838
I didn't want to leave him.

1172
01:11:04,695 --> 01:11:06,931
We found him.

1173
01:11:06,941 --> 01:11:10,362
He's killed himself.
He's done himself.

1174
01:12:26,721 --> 01:12:29,600
Get up.

1175
01:12:29,609 --> 01:12:32,418
Don't make a noise.

1176
01:12:32,428 --> 01:12:34,347
Get up.

1177
01:12:50,295 --> 01:12:52,344
Where are your
car keys?

1178
01:12:56,476 --> 01:12:59,249
If you make a noise,
I'll push this

1179
01:12:59,259 --> 01:13:01,175
in your spine.

1180
01:13:04,997 --> 01:13:06,917
Get in.

1181
01:14:19,754 --> 01:14:21,674
Here.

1182
01:14:32,469 --> 01:14:34,388
Do you remember me?

1183
01:14:36,793 --> 01:14:38,712
Yeah.

1184
01:14:40,603 --> 01:14:42,941
Why have I brought you here?

1185
01:14:47,842 --> 01:14:49,915
This is where
Anthony was--

1186
01:14:49,925 --> 01:14:51,845
Was?

1187
01:14:53,384 --> 01:14:55,304
When he what?

1188
01:14:59,725 --> 01:15:02,832
Come on, have the bollocks
to say it.

1189
01:15:04,659 --> 01:15:06,676
Where he hung himself.

1190
01:15:08,277 --> 01:15:10,323
Why him?

1191
01:15:10,332 --> 01:15:12,761
'Cause he was weak.

1192
01:15:15,516 --> 01:15:17,754
'Cause he was a spastic.

1193
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:19,963
He wasn't a spastic.

1194
01:15:19,973 --> 01:15:23,102
He fuckin' was a spastic.

1195
01:15:28,525 --> 01:15:30,445
He was a fuckin' nana.

1196
01:15:32,299 --> 01:15:34,115
He looked up to you.

1197
01:15:34,125 --> 01:15:37,552
Well, he was a fuckin'
embarrassment to me.

1198
01:15:42,453 --> 01:15:44,598
What did you do to him?

1199
01:15:47,225 --> 01:15:49,274
What did you do?

1200
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:55,997
We were--
I said you!

1201
01:15:56,007 --> 01:15:59,189
What did you fuckin' do?
Not them cocks.

1202
01:16:04,008 --> 01:16:05,928
I didn't stop it.

1203
01:16:07,307 --> 01:16:09,416
I didn't stop it.

1204
01:16:09,426 --> 01:16:13,293
Well, I wish you had...

1205
01:16:13,302 --> 01:16:17,055
'cause you could have stopped
a lot of carnage.

1206
01:16:19,126 --> 01:16:20,558
What do you mean?

1207
01:16:20,567 --> 01:16:22,480
They're all fuckin' dead.

1208
01:16:22,489 --> 01:16:24,920
I executed them.

1209
01:16:24,929 --> 01:16:27,581
And you're the last one.

1210
01:16:33,219 --> 01:16:35,845
Now I'm the monster.

1211
01:16:44,238 --> 01:16:47,211
Was he calling for me?

1212
01:16:47,221 --> 01:16:51,300
When you were torturing him,
was he calling for me?

1213
01:16:53,621 --> 01:16:55,541
Yeah.

1214
01:16:59,643 --> 01:17:01,757
Was he screaming my name?

1215
01:17:05,408 --> 01:17:07,522
Yeah, he was.

1216
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:11,237
He still is.

1217
01:17:30,264 --> 01:17:32,344
I love you, Anthony.

1218
01:17:35,132 --> 01:17:38,650
I love you, kid,
but I can't do him.

1219
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:41,533
I can't do him.

1220
01:17:41,543 --> 01:17:44,035
I'm sorry.

1221
01:17:53,261 --> 01:17:55,406
Take this from me.

1222
01:18:00,691 --> 01:18:01,995
No.
You take it.

1223
01:18:02,004 --> 01:18:04,369
No. I don't want it.

1224
01:18:04,379 --> 01:18:05,678
If you don't take this
knife from me,

1225
01:18:05,688 --> 01:18:06,960
I'm gonna do something
awful with it.

1226
01:18:06,969 --> 01:18:08,889
Take it.

1227
01:18:11,805 --> 01:18:13,790
Take it.

1228
01:18:15,234 --> 01:18:17,153
Take it.

1229
01:18:29,550 --> 01:18:32,429
You...

1230
01:18:32,438 --> 01:18:34,985
you were supposed
to be a monster.

1231
01:18:37,851 --> 01:18:40,311
Now I'm the fuckin' beast.

1232
01:18:46,077 --> 01:18:48,198
There's blood on my hands.

1233
01:18:49,248 --> 01:18:52,413
Look what you made me do.

1234
01:18:52,423 --> 01:18:54,400
No. No.

1235
01:18:54,409 --> 01:18:56,642
Come on.

1236
01:18:56,652 --> 01:18:58,335
Stick that knife in me.

1237
01:18:58,344 --> 01:19:01,479
No. I can't.

1238
01:19:01,488 --> 01:19:05,650
Please. I don't know what else
I'm capable of doing.

1239
01:19:07,217 --> 01:19:09,198
I've got kids.

1240
01:19:09,208 --> 01:19:11,128
I've got children.

1241
01:19:12,405 --> 01:19:13,517
Hyah!

1242
01:19:13,526 --> 01:19:16,147
I just wanna lie
with my brother.

1243
01:19:16,157 --> 01:19:18,555
Where are you?

1244
01:19:20,252 --> 01:19:22,586
No.
Yeah.

1245
01:19:22,595 --> 01:19:25,340
