1
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:20,790
'If anyone finds this,
it means that my plan didn't work...

2
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:23,626
...and I'm already dead.

3
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:26,253
Evan?
- I think he's in here.

4
00:01:26,337 --> 00:01:30,925
If I can somehow
go back to the beginning...

5
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:33,886
...of all of this, I might be able...
- Evan.

6
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:38,057
...to save her.'

7
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,267
Evan.

8
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,856
Evan.

9
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,945
We're gonna be
late again.

10
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:37,240
When did you ever care
about getting to school on time?

11
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,785
We're putting up pictures
for parents' night.

12
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,537
Don't worry,
you'll have plenty of time.

13
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:46,416
Is Dad gonna come?

14
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,335
You know the answer to that.

15
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,795
Can't he just
come out for one day?

16
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,839
We've been over this 100 times.

17
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,591
It's too dangerous for him.

18
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,843
But Lenny said
his dad's coming,

19
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,845
and Tommy
and Kayleigh's dad...

20
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:01,514
Okay, I get the point.

21
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,516
But I'm not so bad, am I?

22
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,268
No.

23
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,201
Okay, have a great day.

24
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,578
I love you.
I'll pick you up later. Gotta go.

25
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,332
Bye.

26
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,961
Bye.

27
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,341
Mrs. Treborn, I need
to speak with you.

28
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,718
Can it wait till tonight?
I'm late for work and...

29
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:41,429
I think you really
need to see this.

30
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,391
Tommy, leave Lenny alone.

31
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,643
Don't make me send you
to Mr. Voytek's office.

32
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,147
I was gonna show this
to the principal,

33
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,024
but I thought I should
talk to you first.

34
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,275
What is it?

35
00:03:54,358 --> 00:03:56,360
Yesterday I had all the children
make drawings...

36
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,279
of what they wanted to be
when they grew up.

37
00:03:58,362 --> 00:04:00,740
Most of them made drawings
of what their parents did.

38
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,492
But this...

39
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,337
I don't understand.

40
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,464
Evan did this?

41
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,635
Can I keep this drawing?
- Oh, of course.

42
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,596
Um, there is one more thing,
Mrs. Treborn,

43
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:26,766
I feel bad even mentioning.
- What?

44
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,726
When I asked Evan
about the drawing,

45
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:32,480
well, he couldn't
remember doing it.

46
00:04:40,696 --> 00:04:42,990
I don't wanna go.

47
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:46,660
I don't like this place, Mum.

48
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,662
I think it's creepy.

49
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,249
I promise I won't
make any bad pictures.

50
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,627
You're gonna be fine, okay?

51
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,212
He just wants to do
a couple tests, that's all.

52
00:04:57,296 --> 00:04:59,506
Oh.
- You'll like him.

53
00:05:02,926 --> 00:05:05,471
That's good.
You're doing great.

54
00:05:05,554 --> 00:05:08,682
Just tell me he hasn't inherited
his father's illness.

55
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:11,143
I'm sure the test results
will come back negative.

56
00:05:11,226 --> 00:05:13,854
But there's something else you can do
to monitor his memory.

57
00:05:13,937 --> 00:05:16,690
Anything.
- A journal.

58
00:05:16,773 --> 00:05:19,151
Just have him write down
everything that he does.

59
00:05:19,234 --> 00:05:21,987
And what will that do?
- It could help jog his memory.

60
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,865
See if he remembers
anything new the next day.

61
00:05:24,948 --> 00:05:27,367
These test results
will come back in a few days...

62
00:05:27,451 --> 00:05:29,536
and we'll take it from there.
- Okay.

63
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,166
'Today Mummy is taking me
to play with Kayleigh and Tommy.

64
00:05:34,249 --> 00:05:37,294
I will meet their father
and see what a real dad is like.'

65
00:05:40,213 --> 00:05:42,382
Great, see you soon.

66
00:05:53,602 --> 00:05:55,896
Evan...

67
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:59,024
Evan, what are you doing
with that knife?

68
00:06:07,532 --> 00:06:09,409
What happened?

69
00:06:09,492 --> 00:06:11,745
Honey...

70
00:06:11,828 --> 00:06:14,039
what were you doing
with that knife?

71
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:17,959
I don't remember.

72
00:06:29,304 --> 00:06:31,931
Hey, Andrea.
- George.

73
00:06:32,015 --> 00:06:34,058
Hello, little man.

74
00:06:34,142 --> 00:06:36,269
Watch your step.

75
00:06:40,565 --> 00:06:42,150
Thanks, George.

76
00:06:42,233 --> 00:06:45,069
Not a problem.
- Here's my work number...

77
00:06:45,153 --> 00:06:46,863
in case there are
any problems.

78
00:06:46,946 --> 00:06:49,407
And please keep
an eye on him 'cause...

79
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,950
What, are you kidding?

80
00:06:51,034 --> 00:06:53,327
We're going to have
a great time today, right, sport?

81
00:06:53,411 --> 00:06:55,955
Okay, be good, kiddo.

82
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:57,373
I love you.

83
00:06:57,457 --> 00:06:58,875
Bye-bye.
- Bye, George.

84
00:07:00,251 --> 00:07:02,253
Go long. Go on.
Right in the backyard.

85
00:07:02,336 --> 00:07:03,713
Here it comes.

86
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,843
Evan, Evan, guess what?
Dad got a new video camera...

87
00:07:08,926 --> 00:07:10,803
and we're all going
to be in a movie.

88
00:07:10,887 --> 00:07:12,930
That's right, Evan.

89
00:07:13,014 --> 00:07:16,350
And you get to be the star.

90
00:07:16,434 --> 00:07:18,019
I thought I was the star.

91
00:07:18,102 --> 00:07:19,353
Hey, what did I tell you?

92
00:07:20,813 --> 00:07:22,523
Now, Evan...

93
00:07:22,607 --> 00:07:24,900
You have to promise...

94
00:07:24,984 --> 00:07:28,612
your bestest,
super-duper promise...

95
00:07:28,696 --> 00:07:30,990
that this will be
our little secret.

96
00:07:31,073 --> 00:07:34,285
You think you can do that?
- Um-hmm.

97
00:07:34,368 --> 00:07:35,786
I'm r...

98
00:07:43,085 --> 00:07:44,795
Where am I?

99
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,589
Where did we all go?

100
00:07:46,672 --> 00:07:48,632
Calm down, kid, stand still.

101
00:07:48,716 --> 00:07:50,426
I was just somewhere else.

102
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:52,011
How did I get here?

103
00:07:52,094 --> 00:07:55,180
Quit acting like some damn retard,
or I'll call your mother...

104
00:07:55,264 --> 00:07:58,267
and tell her what a naughty
little shit you've been.

105
00:08:00,394 --> 00:08:01,812
Kayleigh...

106
00:08:01,895 --> 00:08:04,023
Kayleigh...

107
00:08:04,106 --> 00:08:06,483
what happened?

108
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,246
The good news is
the results are negative.

109
00:08:19,329 --> 00:08:21,248
I found no evidence of lesions,

110
00:08:21,331 --> 00:08:22,666
haemorrhaging, tumours.

111
00:08:22,749 --> 00:08:25,085
But you must have
something you can go on.

112
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:28,088
If I was to guess, I'd say
the blackouts are stress related.

113
00:08:28,171 --> 00:08:30,215
But he's seven years old.

114
00:08:30,299 --> 00:08:32,926
What kind of stress
can a seven-year-old have?

115
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,887
Plenty. Maybe he has
severe coping problems...

116
00:08:35,971 --> 00:08:37,597
about not having a father.

117
00:08:37,681 --> 00:08:39,933
You said the last time
the blackouts occurred...

118
00:08:40,017 --> 00:08:41,852
he was visiting
his friend's dad.

119
00:08:43,687 --> 00:08:47,232
Well, he has been pushing me
to meet his father...

120
00:08:47,315 --> 00:08:50,777
and I've been putting it off.
- It's worth a shot, Andrea.

121
00:08:50,861 --> 00:08:53,113
We can arrange
a controlled meeting.

122
00:08:53,196 --> 00:08:56,616
A careful dose of sedatives
for Jason, some security.

123
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,702
Evan comes in
for a quick visit,

124
00:08:58,785 --> 00:09:00,412
and with a little luck,

125
00:09:00,495 --> 00:09:02,914
no more
missing father complex.

126
00:09:06,835 --> 00:09:08,837
'April 15th.

127
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,047
Today I get to meet my father.

128
00:09:11,131 --> 00:09:14,050
His name is Jason
and he's crazy.

129
00:09:14,134 --> 00:09:16,386
I hope he lets me
call him Dad.'

130
00:09:19,389 --> 00:09:21,391
You mean Dad lives here?

131
00:09:21,474 --> 00:09:23,435
Not in this wing, actually, no.

132
00:09:23,518 --> 00:09:25,395
Now if your dad seems
a little sleepy,

133
00:09:25,478 --> 00:09:27,647
it's because
of the medicine, okay?

134
00:09:27,731 --> 00:09:29,023
Okay.

135
00:09:31,901 --> 00:09:33,820
It'll just be a moment, okay?

136
00:10:04,976 --> 00:10:07,311
It's okay. I won't bite.

137
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:11,149
You've seen pictures
of me, right?

138
00:10:11,232 --> 00:10:14,402
Uh-huh. Mum says
I have your smile...

139
00:10:14,485 --> 00:10:16,904
and your hair.

140
00:10:19,365 --> 00:10:20,741
Nooo.

141
00:10:22,743 --> 00:10:24,996
He has to die.
It's the only way.

142
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:27,581
Jason, stop.

143
00:10:27,665 --> 00:10:29,125
No.

144
00:10:31,419 --> 00:10:33,963
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be alright.

145
00:10:34,046 --> 00:10:36,924
He's hurt bad.
Get a stretcher.

146
00:10:38,217 --> 00:10:40,428
Come on, let's get him out of here.
- I'm so sorry.

147
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,847
In sure and certain hope...

148
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,349
of the resurrection
to eternal life,

149
00:10:45,433 --> 00:10:48,561
we commend to almighty God,
our brother Jason.

150
00:10:48,644 --> 00:10:51,021
The Lord bless him
and keep him,

151
00:10:51,105 --> 00:10:53,858
the Lord make his face
to shine upon him,

152
00:10:53,941 --> 00:10:56,151
and be gracious unto him...

153
00:10:56,235 --> 00:10:59,196
and give him peace. Amen.

154
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:41,405
Come on, where is it?
Damn, I know it's down here somewhere.

155
00:11:41,488 --> 00:11:43,949
Tommy, I'm bored shitless
over here. What's up already?

156
00:11:44,032 --> 00:11:45,951
Yeah, what are you
looking for, anyway?

157
00:11:46,034 --> 00:11:49,287
Shut up, lard arse. And you,
hold your fucking horses.

158
00:11:49,371 --> 00:11:51,456
You know,
it's here somewhere.

159
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,750
We should go soon.

160
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:56,503
If dad catches us smoking
down here, we're dead.

161
00:11:56,586 --> 00:11:58,964
So let's go.

162
00:12:00,924 --> 00:12:03,844
I knew Dad had
a blockbuster down here.

163
00:12:03,927 --> 00:12:05,887
Let's blow the shit
out of something.

164
00:12:15,605 --> 00:12:17,691
Here you go, buddy.

165
00:12:17,774 --> 00:12:19,317
What? No freaking way.

166
00:12:19,401 --> 00:12:22,320
I'm not touching this thing.
- The hell you aren't.

167
00:12:22,404 --> 00:12:25,156
Any of us does it and you're gonna
puss out and nark for sure.

168
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,992
Ain't gonna work this time, buddy.
Look how small this fuse is.

169
00:12:28,076 --> 00:12:30,495
I'll get killed.
- Not necessarily.

170
00:12:33,873 --> 00:12:35,917
There you go.

171
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,461
It should buy you
two minutes at least.

172
00:12:38,545 --> 00:12:40,130
Gee thanks, friend.

173
00:12:49,514 --> 00:12:52,058
Aw, for Christ's sake,
Lenny, you moron, just do it.

174
00:13:03,861 --> 00:13:06,989
Thanks.
- You got balls, man.

175
00:13:07,073 --> 00:13:08,991
Shit took you long enough.

176
00:13:37,103 --> 00:13:38,813
What the hell? Come on.

177
00:13:38,896 --> 00:13:40,856
Evan, come on.
Help me get him up.

178
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,192
Evan, get your arse back here
and help me get him up.

179
00:13:43,275 --> 00:13:44,944
What the hell happened?
Where are we?

180
00:13:45,027 --> 00:13:47,029
Oh my God.
What did we do?

181
00:13:47,113 --> 00:13:49,698
Evan, come on. Help me.

182
00:13:49,782 --> 00:13:51,951
Oh my God, how could we?

183
00:13:52,034 --> 00:13:54,620
Come on, let's go.
- Shit, Lenny, what happened to you?

184
00:13:54,703 --> 00:13:56,372
He's fine.
He's gonna be okay.

185
00:13:56,455 --> 00:13:58,290
Everything's gonna be fine.

186
00:13:58,374 --> 00:14:00,584
What's wrong with him?
Why isn't he speaking?

187
00:14:00,668 --> 00:14:02,461
He's in shock, ma'am.

188
00:14:06,632 --> 00:14:08,634
What is it?
What happened?

189
00:14:08,717 --> 00:14:10,803
We were just in the woods
building a fort...

190
00:14:10,886 --> 00:14:13,097
when Lenny freaked out.
One minute he was okay,

191
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,391
and then he just froze up.
Right, guys?

192
00:14:15,474 --> 00:14:17,768
What happened, Evan?
The truth.

193
00:14:17,851 --> 00:14:19,895
I don't know.
I don't remember.

194
00:14:19,978 --> 00:14:23,065
Something must have happened.
Something set him off.

195
00:14:23,148 --> 00:14:25,442
I blacked it out.

196
00:14:25,526 --> 00:14:28,487
Don't try to use your blackouts
to get out of this one.

197
00:14:34,326 --> 00:14:36,286
You're not making it up?

198
00:14:44,169 --> 00:14:46,088
I don't know.

199
00:14:46,171 --> 00:14:49,091
They're keeping him
overnight for observation.

200
00:14:49,174 --> 00:14:50,759
Uh-huh.

201
00:14:50,842 --> 00:14:53,637
I just don't know
what to do with him.

202
00:14:58,475 --> 00:15:00,936
'The last thing
I remember before the blackout...

203
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:03,814
was holding my hands
over Kayleigh's ears.

204
00:15:03,897 --> 00:15:05,941
I think I was more focused
on her hands on mine...

205
00:15:06,024 --> 00:15:08,318
than the mailbox
across the street.

206
00:15:08,401 --> 00:15:11,446
Mum thinks that hypnosis
might be a good way to remember.'

207
00:15:26,711 --> 00:15:28,338
Damn it.

208
00:16:27,188 --> 00:16:30,358
Breathe in and breathe out.

209
00:16:30,441 --> 00:16:32,109
And relax.

210
00:16:32,193 --> 00:16:35,363
You are completely asleep.

211
00:16:35,446 --> 00:16:37,073
Relaxed.

212
00:16:38,282 --> 00:16:40,076
I want you to take me
to the time...

213
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:42,536
you were in the woods
with Lenny.

214
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,914
Think of it like a movie.

215
00:16:44,997 --> 00:16:47,458
You can pause, rewind,

216
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:51,003
or slow down
any details you wish.

217
00:16:51,087 --> 00:16:53,506
Understand?

218
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,175
Yes.

219
00:16:56,258 --> 00:16:58,260
Where are you now?

220
00:16:59,762 --> 00:17:01,764
I'm standing next to Kayleigh.

221
00:17:01,847 --> 00:17:04,391
My hands are over her ears.

222
00:17:04,475 --> 00:17:06,060
Are you hurting her?

223
00:17:06,143 --> 00:17:08,979
No, I'm protecting her.

224
00:17:09,063 --> 00:17:11,065
Okay.

225
00:17:11,148 --> 00:17:15,110
Now let's move forward in time.
What do you see?

226
00:17:18,572 --> 00:17:20,616
I see a car.

227
00:17:22,326 --> 00:17:25,371
Yes, Evan,
tell me about the car.

228
00:17:26,455 --> 00:17:28,415
Go on.

229
00:17:28,499 --> 00:17:30,876
Nothing can hurt you.

230
00:17:32,377 --> 00:17:36,256
Remember, it's only a movie.
You are completely safe.

231
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,759
I can't...

232
00:17:38,842 --> 00:17:40,886
The car vanishes
and all of a sudden

233
00:17:40,969 --> 00:17:42,846
I'm on the ground
in the woods.

234
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,306
The car doesn't vanish, Evan.

235
00:17:44,389 --> 00:17:47,434
The movie in your head
is broken, that's all.

236
00:17:47,517 --> 00:17:49,603
Now tell me about the car.

237
00:17:49,686 --> 00:17:51,271
I can't.

238
00:17:51,355 --> 00:17:53,815
It's coming...

239
00:17:53,899 --> 00:17:55,942
Fight it, Evan, hurry.

240
00:17:56,026 --> 00:17:57,944
It's coming.

241
00:17:58,028 --> 00:17:59,946
Oh my God.
- On the count of 10,

242
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,866
you'll wake up feeling refreshed...
- What are you doing?

243
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:05,535
...and remembering everything
that we talked about.

244
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:07,079
What is happening?
Make it stop.

245
00:18:07,162 --> 00:18:10,874
One, you're feeling awake. Two,
your eyes are not feeling as heavy.

246
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:12,292
Five, six.
- Wake up.

247
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:15,337
Come on, Evan, wake up. Nine, 10.
- Wake up.

248
00:18:17,214 --> 00:18:19,424
Oh God.

249
00:18:22,385 --> 00:18:24,221
What happened?

250
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:25,722
Did it work?

251
00:18:33,104 --> 00:18:35,148
Alright, thanks, Mum.
See you later.

252
00:18:43,948 --> 00:18:45,784
Wipe that sad-arse look
off your face...

253
00:18:45,867 --> 00:18:47,577
before you get us busted.

254
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,913
Did you see the way Evan's mum
was looking at you?

255
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:51,831
Sorry.

256
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,587
Alright, will someone
tell me already...

257
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,547
what the hell happened
with the mailbox?

258
00:19:02,091 --> 00:19:04,302
Don't you ever
bring that shit up again.

259
00:19:04,385 --> 00:19:06,554
Not ever.

260
00:19:12,101 --> 00:19:14,187
Let's go.

261
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,900
Are you okay?

262
00:19:32,914 --> 00:19:34,540
Holy shit.

263
00:19:34,624 --> 00:19:36,584
Look at that fat fuck.

264
00:19:36,667 --> 00:19:38,836
He's got bigger titties
than Lenny's mum.

265
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,839
Shhh.
- Shut up, faggot.

266
00:19:41,923 --> 00:19:44,383
No one's talking to you.

267
00:20:07,948 --> 00:20:10,576
I'm sorry, Kayleigh,
this was a bad idea.

268
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:13,996
You really don't remember
anything that happened?

269
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:17,374
You're so lucky.

270
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,168
Look, everything's
gonna be okay.

271
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:22,421
Lenny'll be fine. You'll see.

272
00:20:23,714 --> 00:20:25,299
Sorry.

273
00:20:25,382 --> 00:20:27,634
It's not your fault.
Mrs. Kagan called Dad...

274
00:20:27,718 --> 00:20:29,553
and blamed us
for what happened to Lenny.

275
00:20:29,636 --> 00:20:31,722
Your dad did that?

276
00:20:31,805 --> 00:20:35,726
I deserve a lot worse.
- What are you talking about?

277
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:37,936
What you deserve is
a better father and brother.

278
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,355
All they do is
make you feel like shit.

279
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:45,652
You really have no clue
how beautiful you are, do you?

280
00:20:56,872 --> 00:20:59,041
What the fuck are you doing?.

281
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:01,835
Buying popcorn.
What the fuck are you doing?

282
00:21:01,918 --> 00:21:05,172
Whoops.
- I can't believe you freaking did that.

283
00:21:05,255 --> 00:21:08,425
He's a little punk.
- Why are you being such a dick?

284
00:21:13,513 --> 00:21:15,640
I can't believe
what you just did.

285
00:21:20,687 --> 00:21:22,439
Stop it.

286
00:21:22,522 --> 00:21:23,899
Stop hitting him.

287
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:25,942
What's wrong with you?

288
00:21:28,028 --> 00:21:30,405
Somebody, please help us.

289
00:21:30,488 --> 00:21:33,325
Alright, that's it, kid.
You're out of here.

290
00:21:36,536 --> 00:21:40,623
Get him away. Get him away.

291
00:21:40,707 --> 00:21:44,127
Now in another story,
the peaceful town of Briarville...

292
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:45,879
was rocked this afternoon...

293
00:21:45,962 --> 00:21:48,465
in the wake of a horrible
act of vandalism.

294
00:21:48,548 --> 00:21:51,134
While police officials
in upstate New York believe...

295
00:21:51,217 --> 00:21:53,970
this was a simple act
of criminal mischief gone awry,

296
00:21:54,053 --> 00:21:57,265
the tragedy has clearly
devastated the community.

297
00:21:57,348 --> 00:22:00,935
Now this was the grisly aftermath
of a powerful explosion...

298
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:04,606
believed to have been caused
by an unknown quantity of dynamite.

299
00:22:04,689 --> 00:22:08,610
The police have no leads,
no suspects and no motive...

300
00:22:26,419 --> 00:22:28,045
Good night.

301
00:22:37,847 --> 00:22:39,891
We're moving.

302
00:22:57,616 --> 00:22:59,785
I can't believe
Tommy's still pissed at me.

303
00:22:59,869 --> 00:23:02,204
He knows
I'm moving away, right?

304
00:23:02,288 --> 00:23:04,707
He's been acting
real strange lately.

305
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:07,376
He won't even look me
in the eyes anymore.

306
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,378
Duck, here they come.

307
00:23:15,134 --> 00:23:18,012
Did your mum say
if Lenny was okay?

308
00:23:19,847 --> 00:23:23,267
He must be. I mean,
they're letting him out, right?

309
00:23:47,249 --> 00:23:48,750
Welcome home.

310
00:23:48,834 --> 00:23:51,420
I thought you might like
some fresh air for a change.

311
00:23:51,503 --> 00:23:55,632
Is Tommy with you guys?
- No. It's cool.

312
00:24:05,851 --> 00:24:07,811
So, what'd you do in there?

313
00:24:07,894 --> 00:24:10,188
It was awful.
You can't sleep because...

314
00:24:10,272 --> 00:24:12,357
everybody's screaming
all night long.

315
00:24:14,151 --> 00:24:16,153
I never want to go back.

316
00:24:16,236 --> 00:24:17,654
Do you see that?

317
00:24:17,738 --> 00:24:19,781
Yeah, what's up
with the smoke?

318
00:24:43,054 --> 00:24:44,973
Crockett.

319
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,725
What are you doing
with my dog?.

320
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:54,482
Look what you made me do.
- What the hell's wrong with you?.

321
00:25:09,247 --> 00:25:12,709
Kayleigh. Oh, God, come on,
please wake up.

322
00:25:12,792 --> 00:25:15,503
Wake up, please.
Wake up.

323
00:25:15,587 --> 00:25:18,339
Why don't you fucking kiss her,
Prince Charming?

324
00:25:29,267 --> 00:25:31,769
Ow.

325
00:25:34,397 --> 00:25:36,524
How long was I out?

326
00:25:39,152 --> 00:25:40,987
Kayleigh, what's wrong?

327
00:25:45,616 --> 00:25:48,160
Oh shit.

328
00:26:39,044 --> 00:26:41,213
I'm sorry.

329
00:27:09,157 --> 00:27:10,909
Aced it.

330
00:27:10,993 --> 00:27:13,453
And time.
Put your pencils down...

331
00:27:13,537 --> 00:27:16,957
and place your bluebooks
on my desk before you leave.

332
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,794
You too, Mr. Nelson. We're all
in the same time-zone, here.

333
00:27:20,877 --> 00:27:22,713
So how'd you do, Evan?

334
00:27:22,796 --> 00:27:25,465
I don't know. I might have got
some of the stories mixed up.

335
00:27:25,549 --> 00:27:28,927
Was it Pavlov that conditioned
his dog to lick his nuts?

336
00:27:31,054 --> 00:27:33,974
Typical psych major,
a complete wise-arse.

337
00:27:34,057 --> 00:27:35,684
And how's your project coming?

338
00:27:35,767 --> 00:27:38,520
Are you still planning to change
the way we humble scientists...

339
00:27:38,603 --> 00:27:42,023
view memory assimilation?
- Don't really have a choice.

340
00:28:11,427 --> 00:28:14,347
Oh, jeez, it smells like
patchouli and arse in here.

341
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:17,850
Cricket, this is my well-mannered
roommate, Evan.

342
00:28:17,934 --> 00:28:19,519
Yeah...

343
00:28:19,602 --> 00:28:21,729
you're the one
that fucked up the bell curve...

344
00:28:21,813 --> 00:28:23,690
on my anthropology final.

345
00:28:23,773 --> 00:28:25,733
Later, Thumper.
- Bye.

346
00:28:25,817 --> 00:28:28,027
Fucking dick.

347
00:28:28,111 --> 00:28:30,738
Wow, sweet girl, man.
- I found your shirt, bro'.

348
00:28:31,948 --> 00:28:33,866
Oh, you sick fuck.

349
00:28:35,451 --> 00:28:38,913
Alright, man, get dressed.
You're taking me out.

350
00:28:38,996 --> 00:28:41,332
Why, what'd you do,
ace another midterm?

351
00:28:41,416 --> 00:28:43,167
No.

352
00:28:45,294 --> 00:28:48,297
Better than that,
seven years, no blackouts.

353
00:28:48,381 --> 00:28:51,634
Fuck yeah, bro',
let's do this.

354
00:28:51,717 --> 00:28:53,678
Oh, yeah.
- Yeah. Come and get it.

355
00:28:53,761 --> 00:28:57,056
Be gentle with me. Be gentle.
I'm postcoital. I'm tender.

356
00:28:57,139 --> 00:28:59,392
Did she cradle the balls
and work the shaft?

357
00:29:04,188 --> 00:29:05,606
Nice.

358
00:29:08,275 --> 00:29:09,902
Look at this fucking guy.

359
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,239
Get the fuck out of my bar.

360
00:29:13,322 --> 00:29:15,574
So, which one of you
has the pet worm?

361
00:29:15,658 --> 00:29:18,244
Worms, plural.

362
00:29:18,327 --> 00:29:21,247
Ah. That's so gross.

363
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:24,416
Talk to him about it.
He's got the fetish.

364
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,086
Watch it.
It's a psych project actually.

365
00:29:27,169 --> 00:29:28,921
It's a study on memory loss.

366
00:29:29,004 --> 00:29:32,216
Better explain before all this excitement
gives me a heart attack.

367
00:29:34,969 --> 00:29:36,845
10 bucks says he
eats it off the floor.

368
00:29:38,514 --> 00:29:40,432
Well, if I can figure out...

369
00:29:40,516 --> 00:29:42,810
how the memories
in a simple worm function,

370
00:29:42,893 --> 00:29:45,312
it should help me to understand
the complexities...

371
00:29:47,314 --> 00:29:48,982
of the human brain.

372
00:29:50,859 --> 00:29:52,528
Let me get this shot.

373
00:29:59,827 --> 00:30:02,204
What the fuck, weirdo?.
- Fuck this...

374
00:30:09,753 --> 00:30:12,881
Well, I guess
that's your game.

375
00:30:12,965 --> 00:30:15,384
Go, you go.

376
00:30:24,393 --> 00:30:26,311
It smells like sex in here.

377
00:30:26,395 --> 00:30:30,023
Yeah, Thumper had
a busy afternoon.

378
00:30:31,274 --> 00:30:34,236
You're kidding?
He's so big.

379
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:36,196
Yeah.

380
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:40,033
Well, I guess charisma
and eyeliner go a long way.

381
00:30:41,743 --> 00:30:44,037
You want a beer?
- Yeah.

382
00:30:46,581 --> 00:30:49,918
You got any incense or scented candles
or something?

383
00:30:50,001 --> 00:30:51,544
Okay.

384
00:30:53,088 --> 00:30:55,799
Whoa, no.

385
00:30:56,883 --> 00:30:58,718
Let me put this away.

386
00:30:58,802 --> 00:31:01,096
Most guys usually tuck porn
under their bed.

387
00:31:01,179 --> 00:31:03,056
All you've got
are comp books?

388
00:31:03,139 --> 00:31:04,849
Yeah, they're my journals.

389
00:31:04,933 --> 00:31:07,185
I've been keeping them
since I was seven.

390
00:31:07,268 --> 00:31:08,394
Wow.

391
00:31:10,939 --> 00:31:13,942
Read me something.

392
00:31:14,025 --> 00:31:16,402
I ought to be getting
something out of this.

393
00:31:16,486 --> 00:31:18,404
That's all I've got to say.

394
00:31:20,823 --> 00:31:22,784
Here we go.

395
00:31:22,867 --> 00:31:26,079
'It's like my mind refuses
to believe what I'm seeing.'

396
00:31:31,501 --> 00:31:35,338
'... Hearing Crockett
make those awful screams.

397
00:31:41,219 --> 00:31:44,639
Just writing about it
gives me the shivers.'

398
00:31:46,849 --> 00:31:49,727
Come on. Go on.

399
00:31:53,231 --> 00:31:57,568
'It was like Tommy
was possessed or something.

400
00:31:58,819 --> 00:32:01,155
There was a hate
in his eyes that...'

401
00:32:07,954 --> 00:32:09,372
Are you okay?

402
00:32:16,504 --> 00:32:17,713
Where am I?

403
00:32:19,548 --> 00:32:21,801
What the hell's going on?

404
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:34,396
I can't get it open.

405
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,192
Drop it or I'll slit
your mother's throat in her sleep.

406
00:32:42,696 --> 00:32:45,616
Uhh. I got him, Lenny.
Save Crockett.

407
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:56,126
Listen to me, Evan,
and you listen to me good.

408
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:58,504
There's a million
other sisters in the world,

409
00:32:58,587 --> 00:33:01,048
so why'd you have
to fuck with mine?

410
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,471
It's okay.
It was just a dream.

411
00:33:09,139 --> 00:33:10,849
Uh-huh...

412
00:33:10,933 --> 00:33:12,809
it didn't feel like a dream.

413
00:33:12,893 --> 00:33:14,686
Maybe because
they never do.

414
00:33:16,146 --> 00:33:18,732
So, Don Juan, you pass out
on all your dates?

415
00:33:53,934 --> 00:33:56,227
Lenny...

416
00:33:56,311 --> 00:33:58,229
hey, I've got a surprise for you.

417
00:33:58,313 --> 00:34:00,398
You're never gonna
guess who's here.

418
00:34:00,482 --> 00:34:04,069
Hey, it's me... Evan.

419
00:34:39,812 --> 00:34:42,857
What are you working on there?
A model?

420
00:34:45,026 --> 00:34:47,445
Look, uh...

421
00:34:47,528 --> 00:34:49,113
I can see that you're busy,

422
00:34:49,197 --> 00:34:51,532
so I'll try to make this quick.

423
00:34:51,616 --> 00:34:54,410
Remember, uh...

424
00:34:54,494 --> 00:34:56,412
that day at the junkyard...

425
00:34:56,496 --> 00:34:58,789
when we were kids?

426
00:34:58,873 --> 00:35:02,001
I was just hoping that you
could help me remember.

427
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:08,299
Like, just any details about it or...

428
00:35:10,343 --> 00:35:13,471
I couldn't cut the rope.

429
00:35:13,554 --> 00:35:15,890
Yeah...

430
00:35:15,973 --> 00:35:18,768
that's good. Um...

431
00:35:18,851 --> 00:35:21,645
anything else?

432
00:35:26,025 --> 00:35:28,944
'Drop it or I'll slit
your mother's throat in her sleep.'

433
00:35:32,448 --> 00:35:33,949
Uh...

434
00:35:38,996 --> 00:35:40,915
Jesus Christ.

435
00:35:43,751 --> 00:35:46,295
It really happened.

436
00:35:46,378 --> 00:35:48,881
Wow, uh...

437
00:35:48,964 --> 00:35:51,008
Wow, Lenny, l...

438
00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:55,721
'Make one peep...

439
00:35:55,804 --> 00:35:59,725
and I swear it'll be
your last, motherfucker.'

440
00:36:34,217 --> 00:36:36,511
'The last thing I remember
before the blackout...

441
00:36:36,595 --> 00:36:38,805
was holding my hands
over Kayleigh's ears.

442
00:36:38,889 --> 00:36:41,433
I think I was more
focused on her hands...

443
00:36:41,516 --> 00:36:44,978
on mine
than on the mailbox...

444
00:36:46,104 --> 00:36:48,523
across the street.'

445
00:37:00,076 --> 00:37:02,787
Maybe it went out,
should someone check it?

446
00:37:02,871 --> 00:37:05,040
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.

447
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:16,926
You make one peep and I swear
it'll be your last, motherfucker.

448
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:23,558
Ugh.

449
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:25,810
Fuck.

450
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:33,610
What's this?
Huh? What's this?

451
00:37:35,695 --> 00:37:38,156
Want to get the mail?

452
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,243
How's my sweet girl?

453
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:44,412
How's my sweet girl?

454
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:46,748
You need a change,
don't you, honey?

455
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:48,583
You wanna open it?

456
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,918
You wanna open it?

457
00:37:52,795 --> 00:37:54,881
Oh my God.
- Holy shit.

458
00:37:54,964 --> 00:37:57,091
Run.

459
00:37:57,175 --> 00:37:59,385
Fuck, Lenny, come on.

460
00:37:59,469 --> 00:38:01,596
Lenny, come on.

461
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:03,639
Come on, Lenny, let's go.

462
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:11,856
No, baby. That's my finger
in your arse.

463
00:38:17,653 --> 00:38:20,656
Christ, man.

464
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,783
Fuckin' brutal.

465
00:38:24,618 --> 00:38:26,329
What the...?

466
00:38:29,957 --> 00:38:32,752
Hello.
- Hello. Who is this?

467
00:38:32,835 --> 00:38:36,088
Mrs. Kagan, um,
it's Evan... Treborn.

468
00:38:36,172 --> 00:38:38,674
I hope you know
how much you upset Lenny.

469
00:38:38,757 --> 00:38:42,595
Yeah, I'm... look,
I'm really sorry about that.

470
00:38:42,678 --> 00:38:45,264
It took me over an hour
to clean up the mess you made.

471
00:38:45,347 --> 00:38:47,808
Can I just talk to Lenny?

472
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:50,102
Don't call here.

473
00:38:57,568 --> 00:39:00,029
Mum.

474
00:39:00,112 --> 00:39:02,698
I can't help it.
I'm just so proud of you.

475
00:39:02,781 --> 00:39:06,118
Hey, did... did Dad...

476
00:39:06,201 --> 00:39:08,787
Did Jason get good grades?

477
00:39:08,871 --> 00:39:11,707
Please, he got straight As
without ever touching a book.

478
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:14,251
It was the one area
his memory never failed him.

479
00:39:14,751 --> 00:39:16,795
Did he ever say that he, like...

480
00:39:16,879 --> 00:39:21,008
figured out a way to recall
his lost memories...

481
00:39:21,091 --> 00:39:24,177
like years after he blacked them out
in the first place?

482
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:27,639
Why do you ask?
- No, I just figured with him being...

483
00:39:27,723 --> 00:39:29,308
you know, such a brain and all...

484
00:39:29,391 --> 00:39:32,019
it's like, you would think
that he would figure out...

485
00:39:32,102 --> 00:39:34,438
a way to remember
stuff that he forgot.

486
00:39:34,521 --> 00:39:36,690
Well, when he was your age...

487
00:39:36,773 --> 00:39:39,192
almost exactly your age
come to think of it,

488
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:43,071
he said he figured out
a way to remember his past.

489
00:39:43,155 --> 00:39:45,365
I couldn't tell
if they were real memories...

490
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:47,534
or just his imagination.

491
00:39:47,617 --> 00:39:51,955
Then, just before
it got so bad, he...

492
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:55,208
had to be institutionalised,

493
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:57,586
he said he could...

494
00:39:58,795 --> 00:40:01,381
What?

495
00:40:01,464 --> 00:40:03,300
What?

496
00:40:04,801 --> 00:40:06,595
What... what did he do?

497
00:40:06,678 --> 00:40:08,763
Forget it.

498
00:40:08,847 --> 00:40:12,100
It's nothing.
He was far too sick by then.

499
00:40:17,313 --> 00:40:20,233
Come on, Mum, what did he
say that he could do?

500
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,487
What do you say, as a goof?

501
00:40:24,571 --> 00:40:25,989
No, Mum, come on.

502
00:40:26,072 --> 00:40:28,450
Come on, yourself...
it'll be fun.

503
00:40:29,659 --> 00:40:31,453
Alright, it's your dime.

504
00:40:41,963 --> 00:40:43,590
Give me your hand, young man.

505
00:40:43,673 --> 00:40:45,967
This is supposed to be your trick.
- Uh-uh.

506
00:40:49,846 --> 00:40:52,807
Evan.
- What?

507
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:55,810
Have you ever had
your palm read before?

508
00:40:55,893 --> 00:40:59,272
No, this is the first time,
so be gentle please.

509
00:40:59,355 --> 00:41:00,982
What?

510
00:41:01,065 --> 00:41:03,109
You have no lifeline.

511
00:41:04,694 --> 00:41:06,404
You don't belong here.

512
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:10,741
For an extra five bucks
she'll spit in your face, Mum.

513
00:41:11,868 --> 00:41:15,371
No, really, what's his future?
- He has no soul.

514
00:41:17,248 --> 00:41:19,333
You were never meant to be.

515
00:41:24,338 --> 00:41:26,257
Psychic, huh?

516
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:29,260
This won't come as much
of a shock to you.

517
00:41:38,769 --> 00:41:40,563
Thank you.

518
00:41:47,695 --> 00:41:49,864
When did you start
smoking again?

519
00:41:49,947 --> 00:41:51,657
Lay off, Evan.

520
00:41:55,286 --> 00:41:56,912
Hey?

521
00:41:56,996 --> 00:41:58,455
What...

522
00:42:00,082 --> 00:42:03,669
You're not gonna let that old hag
ruin the rest of our time together?

523
00:42:03,752 --> 00:42:06,547
She's nuts, she's a lunatic.

524
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,257
That's like an act.

525
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,175
They just do that...
- I know.

526
00:42:10,259 --> 00:42:13,137
I'm sorry,
she just hit a nerve.

527
00:42:16,682 --> 00:42:20,144
Well... why?

528
00:42:20,227 --> 00:42:22,688
I don't get it.

529
00:42:22,771 --> 00:42:25,524
Before you were born,
I was pregnant twice,

530
00:42:25,607 --> 00:42:28,110
and they were both stillbirths.

531
00:42:35,158 --> 00:42:37,369
Why didn't you ever tell me that?

532
00:42:40,497 --> 00:42:43,250
It's not something
I like to remember.

533
00:42:44,334 --> 00:42:47,379
And then when I was
pregnant with you.

534
00:42:47,462 --> 00:42:51,591
I was terrified.
I had to expect the worst.

535
00:42:55,387 --> 00:42:58,974
And?
- And you came out fine.

536
00:43:00,809 --> 00:43:04,354
And ever since then, I've considered you
my little miracle baby.

537
00:43:13,029 --> 00:43:14,739
Don't cry.

538
00:43:14,823 --> 00:43:16,825
Come on, let's go.
It's late.

539
00:43:28,128 --> 00:43:30,463
'I never wanted to be
in the movie, anyway.

540
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,884
I was cold, so I wanted
to wear my clothes.

541
00:43:34,968 --> 00:43:36,970
Mr. Miller took my shirt off.'

542
00:43:37,053 --> 00:43:38,972
What the fuck are you doing?

543
00:43:39,055 --> 00:43:41,641
Shhh, I need quiet for this.

544
00:43:41,724 --> 00:43:44,269
Are you stupid or what, man?

545
00:43:44,352 --> 00:43:47,063
Maybe there's a reason
you repressed the day...

546
00:43:47,146 --> 00:43:49,607
some pervert had you
in your tighty whities.

547
00:43:52,735 --> 00:43:54,696
I'd think twice
about what you're doing.

548
00:43:54,779 --> 00:43:57,240
You could wake up a lot more
fucked up than you are now.

549
00:43:57,323 --> 00:43:59,826
More fucked up than I already am?
- No, l...

550
00:43:59,909 --> 00:44:01,953
You think you know me?
I don't know me.

551
00:44:40,116 --> 00:44:42,284
Whoa.

552
00:44:42,368 --> 00:44:44,161
I'm sorry.

553
00:44:44,245 --> 00:44:46,330
No, it's my fault.

554
00:44:46,414 --> 00:44:48,624
Can we get through
one damn day...

555
00:44:48,707 --> 00:44:50,376
without you
breaking something?

556
00:45:17,778 --> 00:45:20,114
Hey.

557
00:45:22,908 --> 00:45:24,493
Evan.

558
00:45:26,161 --> 00:45:29,373
Oh my God.
It's been a long time.

559
00:45:31,291 --> 00:45:33,210
How you been?

560
00:45:33,293 --> 00:45:35,879
Same old, same old,
you know?

561
00:45:35,963 --> 00:45:38,757
No, I don't know.
Fill me in.

562
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:41,718
Uhh, well...

563
00:45:41,802 --> 00:45:44,221
I'm going to State now.

564
00:45:44,304 --> 00:45:46,640
It's going good.
My Mum's good.

565
00:45:47,766 --> 00:45:49,977
I don't know.
- You want a smoke?

566
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:52,396
No, not since we were kids.
- No?

567
00:45:52,479 --> 00:45:54,231
I've quit like 100 times.

568
00:45:58,276 --> 00:46:01,530
Are you walking home?
- Uh-huh.

569
00:46:01,613 --> 00:46:03,907
Can I walk you?
- Sure.

570
00:46:06,535 --> 00:46:08,954
Oh my God.
- So...

571
00:46:11,665 --> 00:46:13,875
how's Tommy?

572
00:46:16,419 --> 00:46:19,005
Well, they kept him
in juvie for a few years,

573
00:46:19,089 --> 00:46:23,009
but now he's working
over at Dale's Auto Body.

574
00:46:23,093 --> 00:46:25,136
That's good.

575
00:46:26,554 --> 00:46:28,640
Still living with your dad?

576
00:46:28,723 --> 00:46:30,850
No.

577
00:46:30,934 --> 00:46:33,645
I emancipated myself at 15.

578
00:46:35,772 --> 00:46:37,690
Must've taken a lot of courage.

579
00:46:37,774 --> 00:46:40,235
Not if you remember my dad.

580
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:46,449
Well, couldn't you have just
moved in with your mum?

581
00:46:47,534 --> 00:46:49,410
No, she had a new family.

582
00:46:49,494 --> 00:46:51,454
Wasn't enough room.

583
00:46:51,538 --> 00:46:53,206
Whatever.

584
00:46:53,289 --> 00:46:56,042
Well look, the reason
I came back to town...

585
00:46:56,125 --> 00:46:57,752
was to talk to you.

586
00:46:57,835 --> 00:47:00,004
To me? Why?

587
00:47:01,714 --> 00:47:04,217
Well...

588
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,594
remember when we were kids...

589
00:47:06,678 --> 00:47:09,347
and I used to have
those blackouts?

590
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:11,265
Yeah, of course.

591
00:47:11,349 --> 00:47:15,228
Well, some of those memories
have been coming back to me.

592
00:47:15,311 --> 00:47:17,939
And I just...
I wanted to talk to you...

593
00:47:18,022 --> 00:47:20,149
about one of them in particular.

594
00:47:20,233 --> 00:47:22,485
Well, I'll try to remember.

595
00:47:26,572 --> 00:47:28,950
When we were kids, uh...

596
00:47:29,033 --> 00:47:31,202
your dad was making a movie...

597
00:47:31,285 --> 00:47:34,330
about Robin Hood... something.

598
00:47:34,413 --> 00:47:36,749
What do you want
to know, Evan?.

599
00:47:40,753 --> 00:47:43,089
Is... did he...

600
00:47:44,173 --> 00:47:47,176
What happened
in the basement?

601
00:47:47,259 --> 00:47:49,220
Look, it was a long time ago.

602
00:47:51,097 --> 00:47:53,015
I know.

603
00:47:53,099 --> 00:47:55,518
Is that why you came
all the way back here?

604
00:47:55,601 --> 00:47:58,437
To ask a lot of stupid questions
about Robin Hood?

605
00:47:58,521 --> 00:48:01,023
No, l...

606
00:48:01,106 --> 00:48:04,443
I just think that something really bad
might have happened.

607
00:48:04,527 --> 00:48:06,904
Is there a point
to any of this?

608
00:48:08,989 --> 00:48:11,659
Look, whatever happened
it wasn't our fault.

609
00:48:11,742 --> 00:48:14,828
We were kids. I mean, there was nothing
that we could do to deserve...

610
00:48:14,912 --> 00:48:17,122
Just shut up, Evan.

611
00:48:17,206 --> 00:48:19,249
You're wasting your breath.

612
00:48:19,333 --> 00:48:22,211
You can't hate yourself 'cause
your dad's a twisted freak.

613
00:48:22,294 --> 00:48:25,964
Who are you trying
to convince, Evan?

614
00:48:26,048 --> 00:48:28,300
You come all the way back here
to stir up my shit...

615
00:48:28,383 --> 00:48:30,636
just because you have
a bad memory?

616
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:33,222
What, do you want me to just cry
on your shoulder...

617
00:48:33,305 --> 00:48:35,599
and tell you everything's
all better now?

618
00:48:35,682 --> 00:48:37,851
Well, fuck you, Evan.

619
00:48:37,935 --> 00:48:40,395
Nothing's all better, okay?

620
00:48:40,479 --> 00:48:42,481
Nothing ever gets better.

621
00:48:46,026 --> 00:48:48,820
You know, if I was
so wonderful, Evan,

622
00:48:48,904 --> 00:48:50,781
why didn't you call me?

623
00:48:50,864 --> 00:48:53,325
Why did you just
leave me here to rot?

624
00:49:09,466 --> 00:49:12,928
When he was your age... almost exactly
your age, come to think of it...

625
00:49:13,011 --> 00:49:16,181
he said he figured out a way
to remember his past.

626
00:49:19,726 --> 00:49:21,978
Some dude left
a message for you.

627
00:49:22,062 --> 00:49:24,481
You can smell that all the way
to the bathroom.

628
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:29,694
Hi, Evan, this is Professor Carter.

629
00:49:29,778 --> 00:49:32,822
I just wondered why you didn't
hand in your essay this afternoon.

630
00:49:32,906 --> 00:49:35,658
I was a bit concerned.
Call me to schedule a make-up.

631
00:49:38,286 --> 00:49:41,664
What'd you say
to my sister, motherfucker?

632
00:49:41,748 --> 00:49:44,834
Last night she cried on the phone
for over an hour to me.

633
00:49:44,918 --> 00:49:47,962
She said you came
and saw her last night.

634
00:49:48,046 --> 00:49:49,756
She...

635
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:52,759
she fucking
killed herself tonight.

636
00:49:52,842 --> 00:49:54,844
She's dead...

637
00:49:54,928 --> 00:49:57,764
and so are you.

638
00:51:15,758 --> 00:51:17,760
'If the scar on my stomach...

639
00:51:17,843 --> 00:51:19,928
didn't just come out of nowhere,

640
00:51:20,012 --> 00:51:22,640
maybe my father wasn't
as crazy as everyone thought.

641
00:51:24,975 --> 00:51:28,103
If I can make scars, do I have
the power to heal them?

642
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:32,608
What about Kayleigh's scars? '

643
00:51:38,113 --> 00:51:41,283
'I never wanted
to be in the movie, anyway.

644
00:51:41,366 --> 00:51:46,163
It was cold, so I wanted
to wear my clothes.

645
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:52,336
But Mr. Miller took my shirt off.'

646
00:52:04,014 --> 00:52:06,224
I've got an idea.
Let's go down to the basement.

647
00:52:06,308 --> 00:52:08,810
It'll look more like
a dungeon down there.

648
00:52:10,645 --> 00:52:13,648
A little light here.

649
00:52:13,732 --> 00:52:15,901
Huh?

650
00:52:17,444 --> 00:52:20,447
Hey, now what did I tell you
about keeping that door shut?

651
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:22,115
But I wanna see.

652
00:52:22,199 --> 00:52:24,784
You're going to see the back of my fist
in about two seconds...

653
00:52:24,868 --> 00:52:26,745
if you don't do what I tell you.

654
00:52:28,788 --> 00:52:31,416
Now, in this part of the story.

655
00:52:31,499 --> 00:52:34,878
Robin Hood has just
married Maid Marian...

656
00:52:34,961 --> 00:52:38,131
and they have to kiss and stuff,

657
00:52:38,214 --> 00:52:40,258
like the grown-ups do.

658
00:52:40,342 --> 00:52:42,761
So, take off
your clothes, Kayleigh.

659
00:52:46,264 --> 00:52:48,808
Come on, just like
when we take a bath.

660
00:52:48,892 --> 00:52:51,311
Don't make a big deal out of it.
You too, Evan.

661
00:52:52,937 --> 00:52:56,691
Come on, let's go. Let's go.
We're making a movie here.

662
00:52:56,774 --> 00:52:59,235
Put your hands on your ears.

663
00:53:01,613 --> 00:53:04,115
What time is it?

664
00:53:04,198 --> 00:53:08,536
It's time for you to do
what I tell you to do.

665
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:10,663
Wrong answer, fuckbag.

666
00:53:10,747 --> 00:53:13,499
This is the very moment
of your reckoning.

667
00:53:13,583 --> 00:53:16,753
In the next 30 seconds, you're going
to open up one of two doors.

668
00:53:16,836 --> 00:53:20,465
The first door will forever
traumatise your own flesh and blood.

669
00:53:20,548 --> 00:53:23,259
What... what's happening?

670
00:53:23,342 --> 00:53:25,553
How are you doing this?

671
00:53:25,636 --> 00:53:27,805
It'll change your daughter...

672
00:53:27,889 --> 00:53:29,765
from a beautiful child...

673
00:53:29,849 --> 00:53:32,101
into an empty shell...

674
00:53:32,185 --> 00:53:34,061
whose only concept of trust...

675
00:53:34,145 --> 00:53:37,565
was betrayed by her own
sick paedophile father.

676
00:53:37,648 --> 00:53:39,525
Ultimately...

677
00:53:39,609 --> 00:53:41,360
it'll lead to her suicide.

678
00:53:41,444 --> 00:53:44,030
Nice work, Daddy.
- Who are you?

679
00:53:44,113 --> 00:53:47,700
Let's just say you're being
closely watched, George.

680
00:53:47,783 --> 00:53:50,828
Your other option is
to treat Kayleigh like...

681
00:53:50,911 --> 00:53:53,289
say like a loving father
treats his daughter.

682
00:53:54,623 --> 00:53:56,625
Sound okay to you, Papa?

683
00:53:57,877 --> 00:53:58,961
Yes.

684
00:53:59,045 --> 00:54:01,756
Listen close then, fuckbag.

685
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:03,632
You screw this up again.

686
00:54:03,716 --> 00:54:06,469
I'll flat out castrate you.

687
00:54:08,095 --> 00:54:11,348
What you need to do
is discipline your son Tommy,

688
00:54:11,432 --> 00:54:14,143
because the kid
is one sadistic pup.

689
00:54:15,227 --> 00:54:16,770
One last thing.

690
00:54:23,944 --> 00:54:25,904
Don't ever touch me again.

691
00:54:27,781 --> 00:54:29,408
L... I won't.

692
00:54:49,553 --> 00:54:51,013
Ahhh.

693
00:54:51,096 --> 00:54:52,973
Faster, faster.

694
00:54:55,684 --> 00:54:57,352
Crockett.

695
00:54:58,478 --> 00:55:00,105
Kayleigh, I can't believe
you came.

696
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,108
I think you got one.

697
00:55:03,191 --> 00:55:04,985
Check out our new house.

698
00:55:07,154 --> 00:55:09,322
Forever.
- Hell or high water.

699
00:55:14,244 --> 00:55:15,954
Honey, are you alright?

700
00:55:18,874 --> 00:55:21,084
Oh my god, Evan,
you're bleeding.

701
00:55:21,168 --> 00:55:23,753
Kayleigh, you're still... You...

702
00:55:27,465 --> 00:55:29,259
Incredible.

703
00:55:29,342 --> 00:55:32,971
Well, thanks. Go get cleaned up
and come back to bed.

704
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:37,809
Ohh. Where are my clothes?

705
00:55:37,892 --> 00:55:40,061
Those are your clothes, silly.

706
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:48,361
The bathroom is...

707
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:57,078
Hurry up. I want a quickie
before school.

708
00:56:35,241 --> 00:56:37,243
What?

709
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:40,580
Unfucking believable.

710
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:43,082
Alright.

711
00:56:43,165 --> 00:56:45,501
I wish I could get as excited
over a nosebleed.

712
00:56:46,794 --> 00:56:50,131
Sorry, uh, I didn't
see you there.

713
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,468
What?

714
00:56:54,552 --> 00:56:57,596
You're the girl that
was with those arseholes...

715
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,765
throwing popcorn at Thumper.

716
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:01,851
What?

717
00:57:01,934 --> 00:57:04,729
And your name is Gwen.

718
00:57:04,812 --> 00:57:06,313
I know you.

719
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:10,818
Seriously, Evan,
lay off the blow.

720
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:16,866
Hi.
- Hi.

721
00:57:22,246 --> 00:57:24,498
Hey, um...

722
00:57:24,582 --> 00:57:27,293
don't freak out
when I ask you this, but...

723
00:57:28,961 --> 00:57:32,089
do you remember when your dad
got that video camera?

724
00:57:32,172 --> 00:57:33,549
What's up, man?

725
00:57:33,632 --> 00:57:36,176
Yeah, um...

726
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:38,846
I think he had it like
the first day...

727
00:57:38,929 --> 00:57:40,973
and then he gave it away
or something.

728
00:57:41,056 --> 00:57:43,058
Why would that freak me out?

729
00:57:44,393 --> 00:57:45,978
I don't know.

730
00:57:46,061 --> 00:57:48,230
Just being weird.

731
00:57:48,313 --> 00:57:50,482
You are such a goofus.

732
00:57:53,068 --> 00:57:55,237
So I'll see you tonight.

733
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,114
Okay.

734
00:58:18,802 --> 00:58:20,262
Andrea...
- Evan...

735
00:58:20,345 --> 00:58:22,681
and Chuck...
- aren't home right now.

736
00:58:22,764 --> 00:58:24,683
You know what to do.

737
00:58:24,766 --> 00:58:26,560
Uh, hey, Mum.

738
00:58:26,643 --> 00:58:29,771
It's me. And hey, Chuck.

739
00:58:29,855 --> 00:58:32,941
Ah, I'm just calling
to say hi, I guess.

740
00:58:33,024 --> 00:58:34,901
Give me a call back.

741
00:58:38,488 --> 00:58:41,575
Hey, Thumper, do you know
what time it is, man?

742
00:58:41,658 --> 00:58:44,035
What's the matter,
you lost your Rolex?

743
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:46,997
Fuck you, frat boy.

744
00:58:50,291 --> 00:58:52,711
Remember, everyone,
there's only two more weeks...

745
00:58:52,794 --> 00:58:55,213
until your psych projects
are due.

746
00:58:55,296 --> 00:58:58,299
Uh, about that essay
I missed last week,

747
00:58:58,383 --> 00:59:00,760
we're still okay
with the extension, right?

748
00:59:00,844 --> 00:59:02,679
And you are?

749
00:59:02,762 --> 00:59:05,265
Evan... Treborn.

750
00:59:05,348 --> 00:59:07,225
Well, the answer's no, Mr. Treborn.

751
00:59:07,308 --> 00:59:09,936
Now please take your seat.
The exam is about to begin.

752
00:59:15,483 --> 00:59:17,652
Alright, settle down, everyone.

753
00:59:17,735 --> 00:59:20,363
The exam will begin
in one minute.

754
00:59:24,742 --> 00:59:26,494
Get off me, arsehole.

755
00:59:26,577 --> 00:59:28,955
You guys started that shit.

756
00:59:29,038 --> 00:59:31,624
Evan, you're hysterical.

757
00:59:33,835 --> 00:59:35,545
Did you study for this?

758
00:59:37,463 --> 00:59:39,257
Oh, uh...

759
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:41,384
we'll find out.

760
00:59:41,467 --> 00:59:43,386
Me neither.

761
00:59:54,981 --> 00:59:56,774
Holy shit.
Are these the answers?

762
00:59:56,857 --> 00:59:58,526
Damn, Evan,
keep it on the dl.

763
01:00:05,282 --> 01:00:07,201
Hey, uh...

764
01:00:07,284 --> 01:00:10,913
I want to do something special
for Kayleigh tomorrow night.

765
01:00:10,996 --> 01:00:14,458
Uh, so if I said that I needed...

766
01:00:14,542 --> 01:00:16,877
some help from you
and the brothers...

767
01:00:16,961 --> 01:00:19,463
I'd say, 'blow me.'

768
01:00:21,173 --> 01:00:23,801
Get the pledges to do it.

769
01:00:23,884 --> 01:00:26,554
Right, the pledges.
- Yeah.

770
01:00:26,637 --> 01:00:29,265
You may begin now.

771
01:00:46,115 --> 01:00:48,826
Oh, that was so good.

772
01:00:50,077 --> 01:00:52,037
Oh my God.

773
01:00:53,205 --> 01:00:55,415
Where'd you learn
those new tricks?

774
01:00:56,875 --> 01:00:58,752
Why?

775
01:00:58,836 --> 01:01:01,922
It... it wasn't weird, was it?

776
01:01:03,549 --> 01:01:06,343
Yeah, if you call
multiple orgasms weird.

777
01:01:15,686 --> 01:01:17,187
Hello?

778
01:01:19,272 --> 01:01:21,358
Fuck 'em.
- Hello?

779
01:01:27,072 --> 01:01:28,365
Oh.

780
01:01:32,744 --> 01:01:35,664
What do you think
it is about us...

781
01:01:35,747 --> 01:01:39,876
that makes us so perfect?

782
01:01:41,628 --> 01:01:44,631
I mean...

783
01:01:44,714 --> 01:01:47,175
why did you sneak out...

784
01:01:47,259 --> 01:01:50,136
to visit me
after I moved away?

785
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:52,055
'Cause I missed you.

786
01:01:54,516 --> 01:01:57,310
What, do you think my dad could have
stopped me from seeing you?

787
01:01:58,520 --> 01:01:59,979
What's he gonna do?

788
01:02:02,774 --> 01:02:04,984
Oh, my gosh.
My toes are numb.

789
01:02:06,444 --> 01:02:09,072
Do you think that we'll
be together forever?

790
01:02:14,035 --> 01:02:15,995
That is the plan, isn't it?

791
01:02:17,789 --> 01:02:19,874
'Hell or high water'?

792
01:02:19,958 --> 01:02:21,793
Yeah.

793
01:02:21,876 --> 01:02:23,920
Yeah, that's...

794
01:02:24,003 --> 01:02:25,755
I was just making sure.

795
01:02:28,383 --> 01:02:31,260
Yeah, that's the plan.

796
01:02:41,191 --> 01:02:44,361
Alright, uh...

797
01:02:44,444 --> 01:02:48,448
all you rushes, you know
what you have to do for me.

798
01:02:48,532 --> 01:02:50,367
Pledges, uh...

799
01:02:50,450 --> 01:02:52,286
we're pledges, sir.

800
01:02:52,369 --> 01:02:55,330
Uh, brother Evan, sir.

801
01:02:57,332 --> 01:02:58,875
Are you kidding me?

802
01:03:02,671 --> 01:03:04,756
What?
What did you say to me?

803
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:07,426
You know what, give me the Greek
alphabet. Give it to me.

804
01:03:07,509 --> 01:03:08,969
Uhh-uhh.
- Uhh-uhh.

805
01:03:09,052 --> 01:03:10,804
Alpha, beta...
- Alpha, beta, gamma, delta...

806
01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:13,140
epsilon, zeta, eta, theta,
iota, kappa, lambda, mu, nu, xi,

807
01:03:13,223 --> 01:03:15,976
omicron, pi, rho, sigma, tau,
upsilon, phi, chi, psi, omega, Sir.

808
01:03:16,059 --> 01:03:19,020
Maybe that's what it is.
Don't fucking look at me, look down.

809
01:03:23,817 --> 01:03:25,235
Uh...

810
01:03:27,028 --> 01:03:29,155
alright, um...

811
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:33,493
so, you... you pledges...

812
01:03:33,577 --> 01:03:36,496
you guys know what
you need to do for me.

813
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:38,373
And you guys take a shower...

814
01:03:38,456 --> 01:03:40,625
and if anyone
gives you any trouble,

815
01:03:40,709 --> 01:03:42,377
you tell 'em I said it was okay.

816
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:47,799
What?

817
01:03:51,511 --> 01:03:53,721
Shower that, bitch.

818
01:03:57,976 --> 01:04:00,645
I don't understand.
Where are you taking me?

819
01:04:00,728 --> 01:04:02,981
I'm not telling.

820
01:04:12,323 --> 01:04:14,742
Oh my God.

821
01:04:20,581 --> 01:04:23,042
Wow, it's beautiful.

822
01:04:23,126 --> 01:04:25,962
Go on, sit down.

823
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:28,798
Thank you.

824
01:04:39,767 --> 01:04:41,227
Why are you doing this for me?

825
01:04:42,812 --> 01:04:44,480
When I woke up this morning...

826
01:04:46,274 --> 01:04:48,276
I saw your smile.

827
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:51,112
That smile.

828
01:04:52,363 --> 01:04:53,906
And I knew...

829
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:57,076
that I wanted to spend
the rest of my life...

830
01:04:57,159 --> 01:04:58,994
with you.

831
01:05:12,174 --> 01:05:14,468
I've been looking
all over for you, man.

832
01:05:14,552 --> 01:05:15,970
Someone trashed your car.

833
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:25,312
What the...

834
01:05:26,563 --> 01:05:28,440
Who did this?.

835
01:05:28,524 --> 01:05:30,609
Who did it?.

836
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:32,987
It was probably
those Beta fuckers.

837
01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:35,114
No, no, no.

838
01:05:35,197 --> 01:05:37,449
How did somebody
get away with this...

839
01:05:37,533 --> 01:05:39,535
right in front
of the frat house?

840
01:05:41,286 --> 01:05:45,249
Dude, what is that, a dog collar?
- Tommy.

841
01:05:47,584 --> 01:05:49,628
Don't.

842
01:05:50,712 --> 01:05:52,464
He might be watching.

843
01:05:53,549 --> 01:05:55,133
It's my fault.

844
01:05:55,217 --> 01:05:57,803
I should have told you
he was released a few weeks ago.

845
01:05:57,886 --> 01:05:59,638
Yeah, it might have been nice.

846
01:06:03,892 --> 01:06:05,185
God.

847
01:06:10,774 --> 01:06:13,110
Like this is gonna
do any good.

848
01:06:13,193 --> 01:06:15,445
Maybe one of the frat guys
has got a gun.

849
01:06:15,529 --> 01:06:17,531
Evan, don't even joke.

850
01:06:17,614 --> 01:06:19,324
He's not going
to hurt you, okay?

851
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:21,451
He's just trying to scare you
away from me.

852
01:06:21,535 --> 01:06:23,912
He killed my dog.

853
01:06:23,995 --> 01:06:26,957
You don't remember that?
- Evan, it's not his fault.

854
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:29,584
You know how bad he had it
when we were kids.

855
01:06:29,668 --> 01:06:33,380
Oh no, don't give me
this bad upbringing shit.

856
01:06:33,463 --> 01:06:35,090
You turned out just fine.

857
01:06:35,173 --> 01:06:37,425
My father never
laid a hand on me.

858
01:06:37,509 --> 01:06:40,929
It's like that prick
saved it all up for Tommy.

859
01:06:45,809 --> 01:06:49,854
Okay. Alright. Uh...

860
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:55,735
We'll let campus security
deal with it. Okay?

861
01:06:57,195 --> 01:06:59,614
You know what?
I think I should sleep alone.

862
01:07:01,491 --> 01:07:04,244
No, you're not staying alone.
I'm staying with you.

863
01:07:04,327 --> 01:07:06,538
Evan, I just... I don't want Tommy...

864
01:07:06,621 --> 01:07:08,206
to see us together right now.

865
01:07:08,289 --> 01:07:11,584
No, I lost you once
and I'm not losing you again.

866
01:07:11,668 --> 01:07:13,336
What do you mean
you lost me once?

867
01:07:13,419 --> 01:07:16,297
Evan, you've never lost me.
What are you talking about?

868
01:07:16,381 --> 01:07:19,425
God, you've been
acting so weird lately.

869
01:07:19,509 --> 01:07:23,179
Look, my car just got wrecked, okay?
I'm kind of freaking out.

870
01:07:23,262 --> 01:07:25,890
I know that, but...

871
01:07:25,973 --> 01:07:27,600
your accent's changed.

872
01:07:27,684 --> 01:07:30,853
You don't even walk the same.
- What, I walk differently?

873
01:07:30,937 --> 01:07:32,980
I mean, that dinner tonight,

874
01:07:33,064 --> 01:07:34,941
it was so beautiful.
It was gorgeous.

875
01:07:35,024 --> 01:07:37,026
But it just wasn't you.

876
01:07:37,110 --> 01:07:39,737
I can't do
something nice for you?

877
01:07:40,863 --> 01:07:43,157
Wait...

878
01:07:43,241 --> 01:07:45,159
isn't that your jacket?

879
01:07:55,169 --> 01:07:56,837
Tommy.

880
01:07:57,922 --> 01:08:00,091
You stay away from us,
you sick fuck.

881
01:08:00,174 --> 01:08:02,468
Oh, get this 'us' shit.

882
01:08:02,551 --> 01:08:05,012
Like I'd ever lay a hand
on my own sister.

883
01:08:05,096 --> 01:08:07,556
You're doing real nice
for yourself, Evan.

884
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:09,683
You've got a nice life,

885
01:08:09,767 --> 01:08:11,560
you got nice friends,

886
01:08:11,644 --> 01:08:13,854
not to mention
you're fucking my sister.

887
01:08:13,938 --> 01:08:16,524
Not a bad piece of arse
if I say so myself.

888
01:08:16,607 --> 01:08:19,527
Shut up, Tommy.
- Oh, come on. That's a compliment.

889
01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:21,487
What are you doing, man?
What the fuck?

890
01:08:21,570 --> 01:08:24,490
Oh, it's not good enough that
the whole fucking world loves you?

891
01:08:24,573 --> 01:08:26,742
But you've got to take
the only thing on this Earth...

892
01:08:26,825 --> 01:08:28,786
that doesn't think
that I'm a piece of shit?

893
01:08:28,869 --> 01:08:30,329
You know I love you.

894
01:08:30,412 --> 01:08:32,665
No one thinks that
you're a piece of shit, Tom.

895
01:08:32,748 --> 01:08:36,001
What was it you said?
I think I believe it was, 'sick fuck'.

896
01:08:36,085 --> 01:08:38,045
Don't. Tommy.

897
01:08:40,839 --> 01:08:42,216
Stop.

898
01:08:42,299 --> 01:08:43,884
Stop.

899
01:08:44,968 --> 01:08:47,805
Stop. Oh my God.

900
01:08:49,932 --> 01:08:51,642
Stop.

901
01:08:51,725 --> 01:08:53,685
Oh my God.

902
01:08:53,769 --> 01:08:55,479
Oh.

903
01:08:57,064 --> 01:08:58,899
No, Evan.

904
01:08:58,982 --> 01:09:00,192
Stop.

905
01:09:00,275 --> 01:09:01,360
Stop it.

906
01:09:01,443 --> 01:09:04,613
You're gonna kill him.
- He's a fuckin' maniac.

907
01:09:05,822 --> 01:09:07,741
Don't do this,
I'm begging you.

908
01:09:07,824 --> 01:09:09,576
You ruined Lenny's life.

909
01:09:11,286 --> 01:09:12,704
You killed Crockett.

910
01:09:12,788 --> 01:09:14,706
You killed
that woman and her baby.

911
01:09:15,999 --> 01:09:18,293
Now you're trying to kill me.

912
01:09:18,377 --> 01:09:21,088
Just tryin' to fucking kill me.

913
01:09:33,475 --> 01:09:35,685
Oh my God.

914
01:09:35,769 --> 01:09:38,271
Oh my God,
what did you do?

915
01:09:39,481 --> 01:09:41,816
Oh my God.

916
01:10:12,722 --> 01:10:14,432
You right there, faggot.

917
01:10:42,293 --> 01:10:44,670
First time?

918
01:10:44,754 --> 01:10:46,339
Yeah.

919
01:10:47,882 --> 01:10:49,884
You'd better not
bitch up, man.

920
01:10:49,967 --> 01:10:52,470
You'll wind up someone's
luggage that way.

921
01:10:58,434 --> 01:11:00,102
Can you protect me?

922
01:11:00,186 --> 01:11:01,896
Jesus himself...

923
01:11:01,979 --> 01:11:04,523
couldn't make me stand up
against the brotherhood.

924
01:11:15,910 --> 01:11:17,953
Look, man...

925
01:11:19,038 --> 01:11:21,457
when they come,

926
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:24,627
you go someplace else
in your head, man.

927
01:11:24,710 --> 01:11:27,046
Be somewhere else.

928
01:11:44,229 --> 01:11:46,190
Back your arse up.

929
01:11:58,118 --> 01:12:00,537
Yo, gimme that.

930
01:12:16,970 --> 01:12:20,140
I spoke to your lawyer.

931
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:22,559
And he says he's sure...

932
01:12:22,642 --> 01:12:24,603
he can get you off
on self-defence.

933
01:12:24,686 --> 01:12:26,730
So if you're just patient...

934
01:12:26,813 --> 01:12:29,691
Mum...

935
01:12:29,775 --> 01:12:31,526
How long am I gonna
be in here?

936
01:12:31,610 --> 01:12:33,779
I don't know.

937
01:12:33,862 --> 01:12:36,865
These things take time.

938
01:12:36,948 --> 01:12:38,658
What about the journals?

939
01:12:38,742 --> 01:12:40,785
Did you bring the ones
I asked you to bring?

940
01:12:40,869 --> 01:12:44,039
I found these two.

941
01:12:44,122 --> 01:12:46,082
The others are still in storage.

942
01:12:47,167 --> 01:12:50,378
Mum. L...

943
01:12:54,299 --> 01:12:55,634
I need them all,

944
01:12:55,717 --> 01:12:57,385
all of them.

945
01:12:57,469 --> 01:12:59,471
And I'm going
to get them to you,

946
01:12:59,554 --> 01:13:03,767
but right now, you need
to concentrate on the case.

947
01:13:06,936 --> 01:13:08,730
Please.

948
01:13:11,191 --> 01:13:13,151
Alright.

949
01:13:13,234 --> 01:13:15,153
You're right.

950
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:21,659
What about Kayleigh?

951
01:13:21,743 --> 01:13:23,786
Is she alright?

952
01:13:28,207 --> 01:13:30,168
Try to tell her I'm sorry.

953
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:35,089
Time's up.

954
01:13:35,173 --> 01:13:36,841
I'm not going
to lose you, kiddo.

955
01:13:36,924 --> 01:13:38,885
Promise me you'll hang on.

956
01:13:54,150 --> 01:13:56,903
Shit on my dick
or blood on my knife.

957
01:14:05,703 --> 01:14:07,330
They're mine...

958
01:14:21,218 --> 01:14:23,012
Come on.

959
01:14:24,889 --> 01:14:28,142
Back the fuck off.

960
01:14:28,225 --> 01:14:29,727
Show's over, ladies.

961
01:14:32,897 --> 01:14:34,481
Put this maggot
back in his cell.

962
01:14:34,565 --> 01:14:37,401
Move it.
Come on, let's go.

963
01:14:53,167 --> 01:14:55,878
We'll be seeing you
later on tonight, little sister.

964
01:15:47,304 --> 01:15:49,681
'Today, I found...

965
01:15:49,764 --> 01:15:51,933
my grandfather's
death certificate.

966
01:15:52,017 --> 01:15:55,186
He died in a nut house
just like my father.

967
01:15:55,270 --> 01:15:59,899
Mum denies it, but she thinks
I'm going to end up the same way.'

968
01:15:59,983 --> 01:16:02,944
Boo-hoo-hoo.

969
01:16:14,539 --> 01:16:16,666
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

970
01:16:17,792 --> 01:16:19,252
Come on, Reese.

971
01:16:25,675 --> 01:16:27,260
You're religious, Carlos,

972
01:16:27,343 --> 01:16:29,220
you believe in that whole bit,

973
01:16:29,304 --> 01:16:31,806
the Lord works
in mysterious ways?

974
01:16:31,890 --> 01:16:34,183
Straight up, man.

975
01:16:34,267 --> 01:16:37,937
'Cause I think Jesus sent me
to your cell for a reason.

976
01:16:38,021 --> 01:16:40,523
For you to help me.

977
01:16:42,275 --> 01:16:44,610
Shit.

978
01:16:44,694 --> 01:16:46,529
I knew you were crazy, man.

979
01:16:46,612 --> 01:16:47,989
I ain't bullshitting you.

980
01:16:48,072 --> 01:16:50,032
Jesus speaks to me
in my dreams.

981
01:16:50,116 --> 01:16:52,368
Oh, yeah?

982
01:16:52,452 --> 01:16:55,204
That's cool. Great.

983
01:16:55,288 --> 01:16:58,416
A pack of smokes says
I can prove it to you.

984
01:17:02,628 --> 01:17:06,007
When I'm out, I need you to watch
my hands and face closely.

985
01:17:07,341 --> 01:17:10,011
You need to see
the prison shrink, man.

986
01:17:10,094 --> 01:17:12,680
Just tell me if you see
anything just... weird.

987
01:17:13,973 --> 01:17:15,808
Weirder than this?

988
01:17:15,891 --> 01:17:17,685
It could be marks.
It could be scars.

989
01:17:17,768 --> 01:17:20,479
It could be anything,
I don't know.

990
01:17:21,731 --> 01:17:25,067
'On Wednesday, I got in trouble
for a drawing I didn't do.

991
01:17:25,151 --> 01:17:27,319
Mummy won't let me see it.

992
01:17:42,042 --> 01:17:45,796
Hey, no monkey business, Evan.
Sit down and finish your drawing.

993
01:17:49,925 --> 01:17:51,260
That's great, everyone.

994
01:17:51,343 --> 01:17:53,345
Just imagine
what you want to be.

995
01:17:53,429 --> 01:17:55,180
There's no limits.

996
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:07,401
Oh, Mrs. Boswell.

997
01:18:10,737 --> 01:18:13,031
Sweet Jesus, it's a miracle.

998
01:18:13,115 --> 01:18:15,450
Look, it's stigmata, man.

999
01:18:15,534 --> 01:18:17,494
What'd you see?
What'd it look like?

1000
01:18:17,578 --> 01:18:20,998
The signs of the Lord, man.
They just come out of nowhere.

1001
01:18:21,081 --> 01:18:23,083
Man, I thought you were...

1002
01:18:23,166 --> 01:18:25,377
I though you were
fucking crazy, man.

1003
01:18:26,753 --> 01:18:28,672
So now you believe me.

1004
01:18:30,132 --> 01:18:31,800
Straight up, man.

1005
01:18:43,854 --> 01:18:45,730
Wanna make a deal?

1006
01:18:48,483 --> 01:18:50,986
Alright, look. I'm new here,

1007
01:18:51,069 --> 01:18:52,904
but I think I get
how things work.

1008
01:18:54,656 --> 01:18:56,783
You either join a gang
or you're dead.

1009
01:18:59,119 --> 01:19:02,038
Well, I sure as fuck ain't joining up with no
spics or niggers.

1010
01:19:03,999 --> 01:19:06,334
And I don't want to die.

1011
01:19:06,418 --> 01:19:08,628
So...

1012
01:19:11,256 --> 01:19:12,882
what do I gotta do?

1013
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:17,679
I'm the new guy.
I've got to work my way up, so...

1014
01:19:19,013 --> 01:19:21,057
should I...

1015
01:19:21,141 --> 01:19:22,976
suck your dick now...

1016
01:19:24,310 --> 01:19:26,271
or...

1017
01:19:29,899 --> 01:19:32,944
Is your blood pure?

1018
01:19:33,027 --> 01:19:35,405
Well, I ain't no fucking kike,

1019
01:19:35,488 --> 01:19:36,948
if that's what you're asking me.

1020
01:19:37,031 --> 01:19:39,867
Well then, let's see
what you got, honey.

1021
01:19:39,951 --> 01:19:42,954
Watch the fucking teeth
or you'll be leaving without 'em.

1022
01:19:43,037 --> 01:19:44,497
Yes, Sir.

1023
01:19:53,464 --> 01:19:55,299
Come to daddy.

1024
01:20:00,346 --> 01:20:01,472
Carlos.

1025
01:20:07,562 --> 01:20:09,522
'We took the woods
behind the junkyard...

1026
01:20:09,605 --> 01:20:11,732
just to make sure we wouldn't
bump into Tommy.

1027
01:20:11,816 --> 01:20:14,443
We hadn't seen
the smoke yet.'

1028
01:20:14,527 --> 01:20:16,362
Hold 'em. Hold 'em.

1029
01:20:16,445 --> 01:20:18,281
'We took the woods
behind the junkyard...

1030
01:20:18,364 --> 01:20:20,491
just to make sure we wouldn't
bump into Tommy.

1031
01:20:20,574 --> 01:20:22,368
We hadn't seen
the smoke yet.'

1032
01:20:26,205 --> 01:20:28,541
Rot in hell,
you fucking animals.

1033
01:20:30,209 --> 01:20:32,795
Wait, before we...

1034
01:20:32,878 --> 01:20:35,339
we need something
that could open the sack.

1035
01:20:46,225 --> 01:20:48,060
I want you to take this, Lenny.

1036
01:20:48,143 --> 01:20:50,187
Today's your day of atonement.

1037
01:20:50,271 --> 01:20:52,982
I know how guilty you feel
about that woman and her baby.

1038
01:20:53,065 --> 01:20:55,276
Evan, stop it.
It's not the time.

1039
01:20:55,359 --> 01:20:58,529
Now's the only time. Today you get
a chance to redeem yourself,

1040
01:20:58,612 --> 01:21:00,572
to start all over with a clean slate.

1041
01:21:00,656 --> 01:21:03,409
What are you talking about?
- Evan, you're acting crazy.

1042
01:21:03,492 --> 01:21:06,829
Please, if you've ever trusted me before,
trust me on this one.

1043
01:21:10,666 --> 01:21:12,334
Cut the rope.

1044
01:21:15,963 --> 01:21:17,506
Come on.

1045
01:21:19,466 --> 01:21:22,386
Listen to me good, Evan.
- I'll do whatever you want.

1046
01:21:22,469 --> 01:21:25,013
You don't want me to see
Kayleigh ever again, fine.

1047
01:21:25,097 --> 01:21:26,807
Just let Crockett go.

1048
01:21:26,890 --> 01:21:28,767
Besides, if you kill him now,

1049
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:30,769
they'll stick you
in juvie for sure.

1050
01:21:30,852 --> 01:21:33,814
And I know you'd never leave
your sister alone with your father.

1051
01:21:44,741 --> 01:21:46,159
Lenny, no.

1052
01:21:49,579 --> 01:21:50,956
Oh God.

1053
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:55,418
Oh God, Lenny.

1054
01:21:55,502 --> 01:21:57,420
I said cut the rope.

1055
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:23,279
It's all backwards.

1056
01:22:30,495 --> 01:22:34,999
Ah. Ah. Ah.

1057
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:36,501
Evan...

1058
01:22:40,046 --> 01:22:42,257
What the fuck?

1059
01:22:46,678 --> 01:22:48,221
Lenny, no.

1060
01:22:50,390 --> 01:22:51,975
Want a ride?

1061
01:22:53,226 --> 01:22:54,977
Lenny.

1062
01:22:58,898 --> 01:23:01,526
Somebody call 911.

1063
01:23:01,609 --> 01:23:04,404
Evan. Evan.
Fuck. Evan.

1064
01:23:11,410 --> 01:23:13,079
Hey, doc.

1065
01:23:13,162 --> 01:23:15,248
What's the damage?

1066
01:23:15,331 --> 01:23:17,833
How much time do I got?
- Cute, Evan.

1067
01:23:17,917 --> 01:23:22,004
It's a little complicated. I haven't seen
results like these before.

1068
01:23:22,088 --> 01:23:25,007
Not even with my father?

1069
01:23:25,091 --> 01:23:28,886
Well, actually, they didn't
have these tests 20 years ago.

1070
01:23:28,970 --> 01:23:30,721
So, what did you find?

1071
01:23:30,805 --> 01:23:33,683
We're finding most of
the haemorrhaging is coming from here,

1072
01:23:33,766 --> 01:23:35,810
the outer layer
of the cerebral cortex.

1073
01:23:35,893 --> 01:23:37,686
That's where
the memories are stored.

1074
01:23:37,770 --> 01:23:39,146
Thank you, Evan.
- Uh-huh.

1075
01:23:39,230 --> 01:23:40,689
I've never seen
anything like it.

1076
01:23:40,773 --> 01:23:43,526
We compared these
to the ones taken last year.

1077
01:23:43,609 --> 01:23:46,695
We found severe haemorrhaging
and massive neural reconstruction.

1078
01:23:46,779 --> 01:23:48,280
What does that mean for Evan?

1079
01:23:48,364 --> 01:23:50,282
What he's saying, Mum,
is that I've jammed...

1080
01:23:50,366 --> 01:23:52,826
40 years worth of memories
into my head in the last year.

1081
01:23:52,910 --> 01:23:55,621
It's overload city. I've completely
reprogrammed my brain.

1082
01:23:55,704 --> 01:23:58,749
That about the gist of it, doc?
- Yeah.

1083
01:24:01,752 --> 01:24:04,338
Alright, I'm going
to go wait in the car.

1084
01:24:04,421 --> 01:24:06,924
The light in here is kind
of bugging my eyes, so...

1085
01:24:07,007 --> 01:24:09,593
It was good seeing you, doc.
It really was.

1086
01:24:09,677 --> 01:24:12,638
It was very... very informative.

1087
01:24:12,721 --> 01:24:15,140
But, you know,
I got people to see...

1088
01:24:15,224 --> 01:24:17,976
and things to read.

1089
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:19,937
Alright, see ya.

1090
01:24:51,802 --> 01:24:53,136
Hey.

1091
01:24:56,014 --> 01:24:57,557
It's me...

1092
01:24:57,641 --> 01:24:59,601
Evan.

1093
01:24:59,684 --> 01:25:02,354
Can I get you anything?

1094
01:25:04,689 --> 01:25:06,733
What about...
what about some of those...

1095
01:25:06,816 --> 01:25:08,944
model airplanes you like, huh?

1096
01:25:10,028 --> 01:25:11,613
I bet I can get a shitload...

1097
01:25:11,696 --> 01:25:14,115
of those model airplanes up in here.

1098
01:25:16,242 --> 01:25:17,911
Lenny.

1099
01:25:25,627 --> 01:25:28,046
You knew the whole time,
didn't you?

1100
01:25:31,007 --> 01:25:35,470
When you put that shard
in my hand...

1101
01:25:37,806 --> 01:25:40,975
you knew something big
was going to happen.

1102
01:25:41,059 --> 01:25:43,520
Didn't you?

1103
01:25:44,854 --> 01:25:47,190
Yeah...

1104
01:25:47,273 --> 01:25:50,485
I knew.
- Then you should be where I am.

1105
01:25:54,155 --> 01:25:57,116
You should be...

1106
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:59,118
where I am.

1107
01:26:18,262 --> 01:26:21,349
'Today I get to meet my father.

1108
01:26:22,433 --> 01:26:24,352
His name is Jason...

1109
01:26:25,561 --> 01:26:27,355
and he's crazy.

1110
01:26:29,190 --> 01:26:31,359
I hope he let's me
call him 'Dad.''

1111
01:26:33,069 --> 01:26:35,446
You okay?
'Cause you look like...

1112
01:26:35,529 --> 01:26:37,615
you went somewhere else
there for a second.

1113
01:26:37,698 --> 01:26:40,576
Look, Jason, I need some
fast answers from you...

1114
01:26:40,659 --> 01:26:43,496
if I'm ever gonna fix
what I've done.

1115
01:26:43,579 --> 01:26:46,207
I was praying this curse
would have ended with me.

1116
01:26:46,290 --> 01:26:47,833
Yeah, but it didn't.

1117
01:26:47,917 --> 01:26:50,294
So now I need information
to make things right again...

1118
01:26:50,377 --> 01:26:52,421
and you're the only one
that can give it to me.

1119
01:26:52,505 --> 01:26:53,714
There is no right.

1120
01:26:53,798 --> 01:26:57,051
You can't change who people are
without destroying who they were.

1121
01:26:57,134 --> 01:26:59,637
Who says you can't
make things better?

1122
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:02,640
You can't play God, son.

1123
01:27:03,974 --> 01:27:05,768
It must end with me.

1124
01:27:05,851 --> 01:27:09,104
Just by being here you may
be killing your mother.

1125
01:27:09,188 --> 01:27:11,315
That's bullshit, you know?

1126
01:27:11,398 --> 01:27:14,610
I'll send you a postcard when
I made everything perfect again.

1127
01:27:16,111 --> 01:27:18,072
Ahh. No, no.

1128
01:27:39,635 --> 01:27:41,720
Just get out, did ya?

1129
01:27:41,803 --> 01:27:43,847
Hmm?

1130
01:27:43,931 --> 01:27:47,267
Oh, nothing, just that my brother
did a stint in the pen...

1131
01:27:47,351 --> 01:27:49,102
and he used to eat like that.

1132
01:27:50,187 --> 01:27:53,023
I come from a big family.

1133
01:27:53,106 --> 01:27:54,941
Well, I meant no offence.

1134
01:27:56,610 --> 01:27:57,819
None taken.

1135
01:27:57,903 --> 01:28:00,238
Hey, uh...

1136
01:28:00,322 --> 01:28:02,324
Does Kayleigh Miller
still work here?

1137
01:28:03,867 --> 01:28:05,869
I'm sorry.
I never heard of her.

1138
01:28:23,553 --> 01:28:27,807
God. Can't a man get a little
goddamned peace in his own house?.

1139
01:28:31,561 --> 01:28:34,189
I don't suppose
you're here to sell cookies?

1140
01:28:34,272 --> 01:28:36,066
Good guess, fuckbag.

1141
01:28:37,692 --> 01:28:39,694
Remember me, huh?

1142
01:28:39,778 --> 01:28:42,030
We had a nice chat once
when I was seven.

1143
01:28:44,115 --> 01:28:46,242
I got one question for you.

1144
01:28:46,326 --> 01:28:48,244
Where can I find
your daughter?

1145
01:29:22,153 --> 01:29:24,447
Oh, I thought
you were someone else.

1146
01:29:29,118 --> 01:29:31,329
Make it fast,
I'm expecting someone.

1147
01:29:33,623 --> 01:29:36,751
Hey. It's good to see you.

1148
01:29:38,085 --> 01:29:39,670
Can I come in?

1149
01:29:39,754 --> 01:29:41,589
If I knew you were coming.

1150
01:29:41,672 --> 01:29:44,008
I would have cleaned
the stains off the sheets.

1151
01:29:51,015 --> 01:29:53,184
What do you want?

1152
01:29:53,267 --> 01:29:55,770
I just needed to see
a friendly face.

1153
01:29:55,853 --> 01:29:58,689
Well, time is money, Evan.

1154
01:30:00,774 --> 01:30:02,484
Money.

1155
01:30:02,568 --> 01:30:07,114
I guess I can spare 10 minutes
for an old friend, right?

1156
01:30:07,198 --> 01:30:10,200
So, how's tricks?

1157
01:30:10,284 --> 01:30:12,578
Sorry, occupational humour.

1158
01:30:12,661 --> 01:30:14,288
I got it.

1159
01:30:15,372 --> 01:30:17,541
You can stop now.

1160
01:30:17,625 --> 01:30:19,793
Oh, sorry.

1161
01:30:19,877 --> 01:30:23,672
Does my line of work
make you uncomfortable, precious?

1162
01:30:23,756 --> 01:30:27,468
No, just that you felt like
you had to use it to hurt me.

1163
01:30:30,888 --> 01:30:33,056
I've been where you've been.

1164
01:30:33,140 --> 01:30:34,641
Ha.

1165
01:30:34,725 --> 01:30:36,185
Where is that?

1166
01:30:37,811 --> 01:30:40,814
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

1167
01:30:40,898 --> 01:30:42,566
I know people always say that,

1168
01:30:42,649 --> 01:30:44,401
that you wouldn't believe me,

1169
01:30:44,484 --> 01:30:46,778
but in this case
it's not even worth trying, so...

1170
01:30:50,907 --> 01:30:53,243
I knew I needed to find you,

1171
01:30:53,327 --> 01:30:55,162
so I went over to your dad's...

1172
01:30:55,245 --> 01:30:57,247
and made him tell me
where you were.

1173
01:30:57,331 --> 01:30:59,416
Then I came here
and the rest you know.

1174
01:30:59,499 --> 01:31:01,626
You're right, Evan,
I don't believe you.

1175
01:31:01,710 --> 01:31:04,087
I never thought you would.

1176
01:31:04,171 --> 01:31:06,506
That's why I never bothered
to tell a soul until now...

1177
01:31:06,590 --> 01:31:08,759
and I never will again.

1178
01:31:08,842 --> 01:31:10,760
I'm the only person you've told?

1179
01:31:11,845 --> 01:31:13,430
That's a great line.

1180
01:31:13,513 --> 01:31:16,224
Does that make other girls wet?

1181
01:31:16,308 --> 01:31:18,977
Do they actually
eat up that bullshit?

1182
01:31:21,646 --> 01:31:25,817
You know, I could give a shit
whether you believe me or not.

1183
01:31:25,900 --> 01:31:28,903
Frankly, I'm too tired
to prove it to you...

1184
01:31:28,987 --> 01:31:31,031
Oh, there's proof now, huh?

1185
01:31:32,574 --> 01:31:35,535
How else would I know you have
twin moles on your inner thigh?

1186
01:31:35,618 --> 01:31:38,371
Anyone with 50 bucks
could tell you that.

1187
01:31:38,455 --> 01:31:40,248
Okay.

1188
01:31:40,331 --> 01:31:42,500
Forget that.

1189
01:31:42,584 --> 01:31:44,794
How about the fact
that you prefer...

1190
01:31:44,878 --> 01:31:47,338
the smell of skunk to flowers?

1191
01:31:47,422 --> 01:31:49,883
Or that you hate cilantro...

1192
01:31:49,966 --> 01:31:52,093
because for some reason
unknown to you...

1193
01:31:52,177 --> 01:31:54,137
it reminds you
of your stepsister?

1194
01:31:54,220 --> 01:31:57,891
Or that when you have an orgasm,
your toes go numb?

1195
01:31:57,974 --> 01:32:00,810
I'm sure all of your clientele
are privy to that.

1196
01:32:03,980 --> 01:32:07,483
You know? Look, I just
thought you should know.

1197
01:32:07,567 --> 01:32:09,569
Know what?

1198
01:32:09,652 --> 01:32:12,613
That you were happy once...

1199
01:32:14,032 --> 01:32:15,783
with me.

1200
01:32:17,285 --> 01:32:19,829
You know there's one
major hole in your story.

1201
01:32:19,912 --> 01:32:22,457
There's no fucking way
on this planet...

1202
01:32:22,540 --> 01:32:25,710
or any other, I would ever be
in some fucking sorority.

1203
01:32:30,047 --> 01:32:31,591
You were happy there.

1204
01:32:31,674 --> 01:32:33,593
Oh, you're crying?

1205
01:32:33,676 --> 01:32:36,470
You sure you don't
want your wallet?

1206
01:32:36,554 --> 01:32:38,306
No, I don't need it
where I'm going.

1207
01:32:38,389 --> 01:32:41,559
What, are you off to change
everyone else's life again? Is that it?

1208
01:32:41,642 --> 01:32:44,228
Maybe next time you'll pop up
in some mansion...

1209
01:32:44,312 --> 01:32:46,897
while I end up in Tijuana
doing some donkey act.

1210
01:32:46,981 --> 01:32:49,525
You know what? I'm over it.

1211
01:32:49,608 --> 01:32:51,944
Every time
I try to help someone...

1212
01:32:52,028 --> 01:32:53,571
everything just goes to shit.

1213
01:32:53,654 --> 01:32:56,115
Well, don't give up now, slick.

1214
01:32:56,198 --> 01:32:58,492
Hell, you've already
done so much for me.

1215
01:32:58,576 --> 01:33:00,911
Why don't you go back in time...

1216
01:33:00,995 --> 01:33:03,914
and save Mrs. Halpern
and her baby?

1217
01:33:03,998 --> 01:33:08,794
And then maybe Lenny wouldn't
freak out and ruin my family.

1218
01:33:08,878 --> 01:33:11,589
No, go back
to when I was seven...

1219
01:33:11,672 --> 01:33:15,301
and fuck me in front
of my daddy's video camera.

1220
01:33:16,635 --> 01:33:19,597
Straighten me out a bit.

1221
01:33:33,193 --> 01:33:35,446
You're on my bed.
Get out.

1222
01:33:35,529 --> 01:33:39,491
Buddy, I thought it would be okay
what with you being sick and all.

1223
01:33:49,626 --> 01:33:51,587
I'm not going to say it again.

1224
01:33:59,344 --> 01:34:01,722
'The last thing I remember
before the blackout...

1225
01:34:01,805 --> 01:34:03,974
was holding my hands
over Kayleigh's ears.

1226
01:34:04,057 --> 01:34:06,852
I think I was more focused
on her hands on mine...

1227
01:34:06,935 --> 01:34:08,687
than on the mailbox
across the street.'

1228
01:34:15,819 --> 01:34:17,946
Lady, stay back.
Don't go near the mailbox.

1229
01:34:18,029 --> 01:34:20,991
Idiots.
- I mean it, woman. Get the hell back.

1230
01:34:21,074 --> 01:34:23,368
I'll save you, lady.

1231
01:34:31,376 --> 01:34:34,212
God damn it, I thought
I told you two to get out.

1232
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:37,799
Oh, sorry, man.
Did we wake you?

1233
01:34:39,384 --> 01:34:42,178
No, it's cool.

1234
01:34:42,262 --> 01:34:44,222
Okay.

1235
01:34:46,766 --> 01:34:48,560
It's really cool.

1236
01:35:09,664 --> 01:35:11,374
What the fuck is this?

1237
01:35:17,964 --> 01:35:20,591
Please save his arm.
- Can you open up my locker?

1238
01:35:20,675 --> 01:35:23,553
Happy Birthday.
- Can I come too?

1239
01:35:23,636 --> 01:35:25,263
Do you want me
to hold your popcorn?

1240
01:35:26,639 --> 01:35:29,559
Evan? Get a towel.
Get a towel.

1241
01:35:29,642 --> 01:35:31,644
Evan. Oh my God.

1242
01:35:31,727 --> 01:35:33,938
Evan. Evan.
Evan.

1243
01:35:35,314 --> 01:35:37,024
Hey, where you going?

1244
01:35:37,108 --> 01:35:39,527
You ever notice Kayleigh's smile?
I love her smile.

1245
01:35:39,610 --> 01:35:41,612
Lenny's the best.

1246
01:35:41,696 --> 01:35:43,573
You guys make a great couple.

1247
01:35:43,656 --> 01:35:45,658
You ever think
that I'll find someone?

1248
01:35:47,410 --> 01:35:48,536
Evan.

1249
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:54,125
Where are we going?

1250
01:35:54,208 --> 01:35:56,210
We're taking you
to the hospital, Evan.

1251
01:35:56,293 --> 01:35:59,296
No, take me back.
- Sorry, your mum would kill me.

1252
01:36:01,340 --> 01:36:03,551
Oh.
- You take me back, Lenny.

1253
01:36:04,635 --> 01:36:07,346
You owe me that much.

1254
01:36:12,393 --> 01:36:13,978
What are you geeks
looking at?

1255
01:36:14,061 --> 01:36:16,480
It must be nice to be
so goddamed perfect, huh?

1256
01:36:16,564 --> 01:36:19,942
Fucking losers.
Lenny, help me.

1257
01:36:20,025 --> 01:36:22,194
Here, get him over.
Get him over.

1258
01:36:23,654 --> 01:36:26,699
Hey, Brian, how's
your head feeling, buddy?

1259
01:36:26,782 --> 01:36:28,617
I saw that girl
you went home with.

1260
01:36:28,701 --> 01:36:30,786
Did she borrow
your razor this morning?

1261
01:36:30,869 --> 01:36:32,621
You're so bad.

1262
01:36:33,831 --> 01:36:36,959
Hey, there's Tommy.
Hey, Tommy. Tommy.

1263
01:36:37,042 --> 01:36:39,837
Hey, what's up, guys?

1264
01:36:41,004 --> 01:36:43,090
Hey, man,
I did what you said.

1265
01:36:43,173 --> 01:36:45,884
We're pooling our student funds
with the Hillel house...

1266
01:36:45,968 --> 01:36:48,053
and we're having
an awareness dance.

1267
01:36:48,137 --> 01:36:50,681
Oh, awesome.
Maybe I can spin my chair around...

1268
01:36:50,764 --> 01:36:52,975
to a techno remix
of 'Hava Nagila' till I puke.

1269
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:56,436
Maybe we should be
getting to class now.

1270
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:58,230
What's the point
of psych class now?

1271
01:36:58,313 --> 01:37:01,108
Tomorrow I could wake up
a dirt farmer in Bangladesh.

1272
01:37:02,484 --> 01:37:03,986
Let's go for a stroll.

1273
01:37:05,153 --> 01:37:06,488
Bye, babe.

1274
01:37:06,571 --> 01:37:08,490
Yippee.
- Bye, sis.

1275
01:37:08,573 --> 01:37:09,992
What's up with him?

1276
01:37:10,075 --> 01:37:12,911
So Tommy's really
into this Jesus freak thing, huh?

1277
01:37:12,994 --> 01:37:15,038
You know how spiritual
he's gotten...

1278
01:37:15,122 --> 01:37:17,499
ever since he saved
Mrs. Halpern and Katie.

1279
01:37:19,042 --> 01:37:21,628
He saved Mrs. Halpern?

1280
01:37:21,711 --> 01:37:23,797
Please. The twisted fuck.

1281
01:37:25,173 --> 01:37:27,509
Here, why don't we sit right here?

1282
01:37:35,433 --> 01:37:37,018
Want a granola bar?

1283
01:37:39,688 --> 01:37:41,189
Here, just...

1284
01:37:45,402 --> 01:37:47,779
Yeah, I gotta fix
these things or something.

1285
01:37:50,699 --> 01:37:52,700
Kayleigh...

1286
01:37:52,784 --> 01:37:54,619
do you ever think about us?

1287
01:37:54,702 --> 01:37:57,664
I mean, do you ever wonder...

1288
01:37:57,747 --> 01:38:00,500
if things might have been
different between us?

1289
01:38:00,583 --> 01:38:02,293
Sure, Evan.

1290
01:38:04,838 --> 01:38:07,465
You were the first person
I really ever cared about.

1291
01:38:09,467 --> 01:38:11,886
I was?
- Yeah.

1292
01:38:13,221 --> 01:38:16,266
That's why when I was little,
I never went to live with my mother.

1293
01:38:17,475 --> 01:38:19,644
I don't get it.

1294
01:38:19,727 --> 01:38:21,938
When... when my folks split up,

1295
01:38:22,021 --> 01:38:25,024
they gave me and Tommy a choice
of who we wanted to live with.

1296
01:38:25,108 --> 01:38:27,819
And I couldn't stand my dad.

1297
01:38:27,902 --> 01:38:30,947
But I knew that if I went
to move with my mum.

1298
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:33,533
I'd never see you again.

1299
01:38:33,616 --> 01:38:35,368
I didn't know that.

1300
01:38:37,036 --> 01:38:40,206
So you still think about us...

1301
01:38:40,289 --> 01:38:42,041
together?

1302
01:38:43,709 --> 01:38:47,171
Well, it's crossed my mind
from time to time.

1303
01:38:47,255 --> 01:38:49,423
And?

1304
01:38:49,507 --> 01:38:52,218
Well, a lot of things
have crossed my mind, Ev.

1305
01:38:52,301 --> 01:38:56,722
I mean, I could play out the entire movie of
our lives in one second.

1306
01:38:56,806 --> 01:38:58,766
Boom, we fall in love.
We get married.

1307
01:38:58,849 --> 01:39:02,645
We have kids.
Our kids grow old, as do we.

1308
01:39:02,728 --> 01:39:05,272
Matching burial plots.
The whole thing.

1309
01:39:06,774 --> 01:39:09,777
Plah, it took a lot longer
to spit out than to imagine.

1310
01:39:11,821 --> 01:39:14,156
Things like that usually do.

1311
01:39:16,408 --> 01:39:18,160
So...

1312
01:39:18,244 --> 01:39:20,246
do you think that
it might have worked?

1313
01:39:20,329 --> 01:39:22,414
Yeah.

1314
01:39:24,458 --> 01:39:26,585
I mean, but that's
not how things wound up.

1315
01:39:29,046 --> 01:39:31,090
I'm with Lenny.

1316
01:39:32,299 --> 01:39:34,343
Lenny is your friend...

1317
01:39:34,426 --> 01:39:36,720
and...

1318
01:39:36,804 --> 01:39:38,514
and that's where it ends.

1319
01:39:41,308 --> 01:39:43,143
Well...

1320
01:39:44,353 --> 01:39:47,314
would it make a difference
if I told you that...

1321
01:39:47,397 --> 01:39:51,485
no one could possibly ever
love anyone as much as I love you?

1322
01:40:00,494 --> 01:40:03,997
I'm not saying that. I...

1323
01:40:04,081 --> 01:40:07,584
Yeah.
- I'm not... I'm just saying it like...

1324
01:40:07,668 --> 01:40:10,754
if you were a girl,
would that be something...

1325
01:40:10,837 --> 01:40:12,673
that you would want to hear?

1326
01:40:16,468 --> 01:40:18,428
Hold on one second.
Lenny's calling.

1327
01:40:18,512 --> 01:40:20,472
I'll be right back, Ev, okay?

1328
01:40:26,645 --> 01:40:28,605
He's a little down...

1329
01:40:29,689 --> 01:40:31,441
I love you.

1330
01:41:27,955 --> 01:41:29,874
You forgot to put
the toaster on the ledge.

1331
01:41:31,376 --> 01:41:34,587
Lenny likes Pop Tarts.

1332
01:41:34,670 --> 01:41:36,881
You guys are all
that matter now.

1333
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:42,011
Man, I know it's hard,
but you can't give up.

1334
01:41:42,094 --> 01:41:45,014
I can't even
fucking kill myself.

1335
01:41:45,097 --> 01:41:46,933
Don't talk like that.

1336
01:41:56,567 --> 01:41:58,861
Alright, I've got
to get you out of here.

1337
01:41:58,945 --> 01:42:01,238
Visiting hours
are almost over.

1338
01:42:05,451 --> 01:42:07,828
Did Mum
get transferred again?

1339
01:42:07,912 --> 01:42:10,956
What are you talking about?
She's been here the entire time.

1340
01:42:18,464 --> 01:42:22,218
Looking... good, kiddo.

1341
01:42:27,890 --> 01:42:29,183
Lung cancer.

1342
01:42:31,018 --> 01:42:33,771
Lung cancer?

1343
01:42:33,854 --> 01:42:37,107
You started chain smoking
when I blew myself up.

1344
01:42:37,191 --> 01:42:40,069
Sorry, Mrs. T, he's been
acting out of sorts lately.

1345
01:42:40,152 --> 01:42:43,155
I think I could fix this.
- Fix?

1346
01:42:43,238 --> 01:42:46,241
I just need the journal entry
about the blockbuster.

1347
01:42:48,619 --> 01:42:51,371
Shit, no arms.

1348
01:42:51,455 --> 01:42:53,332
I never wrote it.

1349
01:42:53,415 --> 01:42:57,419
You're... acting... different.

1350
01:42:57,503 --> 01:43:00,672
No, he's just going through
tough times right now.

1351
01:43:00,756 --> 01:43:02,633
Mum...

1352
01:43:02,716 --> 01:43:04,510
you're going to be okay.

1353
01:43:04,593 --> 01:43:06,303
I can change it.

1354
01:43:06,386 --> 01:43:08,680
Um, maybe... I wanna go
down to the chapel.

1355
01:43:09,765 --> 01:43:14,519
You're... acting...

1356
01:43:14,603 --> 01:43:18,023
just like your father.

1357
01:43:18,106 --> 01:43:21,651
Just 'cause he went crazy
when he was my age,

1358
01:43:21,735 --> 01:43:24,237
doesn't mean
I'm gonna go crazy, Mum.

1359
01:43:25,530 --> 01:43:29,159
How... did...

1360
01:43:29,242 --> 01:43:32,037
you... know that?

1361
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:34,623
You told me...

1362
01:43:34,706 --> 01:43:36,791
on parent's weekend,
remember?

1363
01:43:40,795 --> 01:43:42,923
It wasn't me...

1364
01:43:44,049 --> 01:43:46,218
Just...
...or you.

1365
01:43:46,301 --> 01:43:49,429
Like... Jason.

1366
01:43:49,512 --> 01:43:51,222
You don't worry, Mum.

1367
01:43:51,306 --> 01:43:54,142
I'm going to get you
out of here. Okay?

1368
01:43:54,225 --> 01:43:55,143
No.

1369
01:43:56,061 --> 01:43:57,729
You're not going
to hurt anymore.

1370
01:43:57,812 --> 01:43:59,773
I'm going to fix it.

1371
01:43:59,856 --> 01:44:00,899
No.

1372
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:04,486
No, no.

1373
01:44:07,614 --> 01:44:09,073
Are you sure
you even packed it?

1374
01:44:09,157 --> 01:44:10,909
My mum packed it.

1375
01:44:10,992 --> 01:44:13,077
I think she sent
everything I ever owned.

1376
01:44:13,161 --> 01:44:15,288
Is this it?
- Yeah.

1377
01:44:15,371 --> 01:44:17,457
What do you want it for?
I don't get you lately.

1378
01:44:17,540 --> 01:44:19,125
Duly noted.

1379
01:44:22,337 --> 01:44:24,088
Okay, I have to ask you
one last favour.

1380
01:44:24,172 --> 01:44:26,215
What?
- I need you to be quiet.

1381
01:44:26,299 --> 01:44:29,177
I have to concentrate
if I wanna destroy the blockbuster.

1382
01:44:29,260 --> 01:44:33,222
What? What, the blockbuster?
- If I hadn't blown off my arms,

1383
01:44:33,306 --> 01:44:36,309
my mum would've never started
smoking in the first place.

1384
01:44:36,392 --> 01:44:38,311
Never mind. Just open it.

1385
01:44:40,438 --> 01:44:42,106
Turn it.

1386
01:44:42,190 --> 01:44:44,525
There.

1387
01:44:48,279 --> 01:44:50,364
'Today Mummy
is taking me to play...

1388
01:44:50,448 --> 01:44:52,283
with Kayleigh and Tommy.

1389
01:44:52,366 --> 01:44:55,703
I will meet their father
and see what a real dad is like.'

1390
01:44:58,831 --> 01:45:01,208
Now, how do I destroy
the blockbuster?

1391
01:45:16,432 --> 01:45:19,977
Evan, what are you
doing with that knife?

1392
01:45:23,397 --> 01:45:27,568
Well, that didn't work.
Go on, turn it.

1393
01:45:28,777 --> 01:45:30,362
Turn it. There.

1394
01:45:31,989 --> 01:45:34,617
'I never wanted
to be in the movie anyway.

1395
01:45:34,700 --> 01:45:37,161
It was cold so I wanted
to wear my clothes.

1396
01:45:37,244 --> 01:45:39,246
But Mr. Miller made me
take my shirt off.'

1397
01:45:39,330 --> 01:45:41,081
In this part of the story.

1398
01:45:41,165 --> 01:45:44,793
Robin Hood has just
married Maid Marian.

1399
01:45:44,877 --> 01:45:48,339
And they have
to kiss and stuff,

1400
01:45:48,422 --> 01:45:50,007
like grown-ups do.

1401
01:45:50,090 --> 01:45:52,009
Wait, I need my belt.

1402
01:45:59,016 --> 01:46:01,810
Hey, don't even
bother about a belt.

1403
01:46:01,894 --> 01:46:05,481
Hey.
- Back off, fuckbag.

1404
01:46:05,564 --> 01:46:08,609
Amazing that word never fails
to make an impression with you.

1405
01:46:08,692 --> 01:46:11,195
Easy does it, Evan.

1406
01:46:11,278 --> 01:46:14,281
Don't be a bad boy
or I'll tell your mother...

1407
01:46:14,364 --> 01:46:16,325
what a naughty
little shit you are.

1408
01:46:16,408 --> 01:46:18,368
And I'll tell
Child Protective Services...

1409
01:46:18,452 --> 01:46:20,662
about your little
kiddie porn endeavours.

1410
01:46:20,746 --> 01:46:22,956
One step closer
and I'll shove this up your arse.

1411
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:25,375
Hey, that's dangerous.
You could blow off your hand.

1412
01:46:25,459 --> 01:46:27,586
Been there, done that.

1413
01:46:30,088 --> 01:46:31,256
Hey.

1414
01:46:35,260 --> 01:46:37,220
Sparkler.
- Kayleigh, no.

1415
01:46:37,304 --> 01:46:39,973
No. Kayleigh, no.

1416
01:46:47,814 --> 01:46:49,107
Hey, man.

1417
01:46:50,775 --> 01:46:52,569
...good, kiddo.

1418
01:46:52,652 --> 01:46:55,530
I've got no choice but to commit you
to Sunnyvale Institution...

1419
01:46:55,614 --> 01:46:58,074
You're gonna have to live
somewhere else for a while.

1420
01:46:58,158 --> 01:47:00,243
A squashed butterfly.
- I want my mummy.

1421
01:47:00,327 --> 01:47:01,703
I'm so sick of this.

1422
01:47:01,786 --> 01:47:03,788
I think we should
up your medication.

1423
01:47:33,276 --> 01:47:35,111
Where are
my goddamn books?

1424
01:47:35,194 --> 01:47:38,281
Hey, Evan, we're not supposed
to meet for another hour.

1425
01:47:38,364 --> 01:47:40,700
Where are
my goddamn books?

1426
01:47:40,783 --> 01:47:43,327
Books?

1427
01:47:43,411 --> 01:47:45,371
My journals.

1428
01:47:45,455 --> 01:47:47,415
L... I need them.

1429
01:47:47,498 --> 01:47:51,461
So, if you'd give 'em to me,
it'd help a lot.

1430
01:47:51,544 --> 01:47:53,713
It really hurts me
to go through this again.

1431
01:47:54,881 --> 01:47:56,799
There are no journals.

1432
01:47:56,883 --> 01:47:58,926
There never were.

1433
01:47:59,010 --> 01:48:01,804
It's part of the fantasy world
that your mind created...

1434
01:48:01,888 --> 01:48:05,266
to cope with the guilt
of killing Kayleigh Miller.

1435
01:48:05,349 --> 01:48:08,352
Think, Evan, think.

1436
01:48:08,436 --> 01:48:10,938
You've created a disease
that does not exist...

1437
01:48:12,064 --> 01:48:14,150
alternate universes with colleges...

1438
01:48:14,233 --> 01:48:16,610
and prisons and paraplegia.

1439
01:48:16,694 --> 01:48:19,655
I want my journals
and I want 'em now.

1440
01:48:19,739 --> 01:48:22,658
And I know that you got 'em
and you're gonna give 'em to me.

1441
01:48:22,742 --> 01:48:25,119
You're not going to hide them
from me. I want them.

1442
01:48:27,079 --> 01:48:29,582
You're reminding me
of your father.

1443
01:48:29,665 --> 01:48:31,917
He was always screaming
for a photo album...

1444
01:48:32,001 --> 01:48:34,003
even though
he never had one.

1445
01:48:35,588 --> 01:48:37,298
I'm so sorry.

1446
01:48:41,093 --> 01:48:43,345
A photo album?

1447
01:48:43,429 --> 01:48:46,140
Photos.
- Evan?

1448
01:48:48,267 --> 01:48:51,603
The damage is irreparable.

1449
01:48:56,942 --> 01:49:00,279
Frankly, I'm surprised he still
has use of his motor functions.

1450
01:49:10,414 --> 01:49:12,791
Mum?

1451
01:49:12,875 --> 01:49:16,044
Um, did you remember to bring...

1452
01:49:16,128 --> 01:49:18,297
those home movies
that we used to make?

1453
01:49:19,381 --> 01:49:21,258
Yeah, they're right here.

1454
01:49:22,759 --> 01:49:26,847
Good, because I really like
to watch them.

1455
01:49:30,684 --> 01:49:32,269
So that's good.

1456
01:49:36,982 --> 01:49:39,568
I think it's best we
transfer him to Bellevue...

1457
01:49:39,651 --> 01:49:41,153
first thing in the morning.

1458
01:50:23,695 --> 01:50:26,739
'If anyone finds this,

1459
01:50:26,823 --> 01:50:31,452
...it means that my plan
didn't work...

1460
01:50:31,536 --> 01:50:33,955
...and I'm already dead.'

1461
01:50:35,582 --> 01:50:38,501
He's not in his room.
Search the grounds.

1462
01:50:38,585 --> 01:50:41,838
'If I can somehow go back...

1463
01:50:41,921 --> 01:50:44,340
...to the beginning of all of this...

1464
01:50:44,424 --> 01:50:49,095
...I might be able to save her.'

1465
01:51:01,357 --> 01:51:03,776
I'm trying to have a baby.

1466
01:51:15,121 --> 01:51:16,247
Go away.

1467
01:51:31,095 --> 01:51:32,680
Something's wrong.

1468
01:51:32,763 --> 01:51:34,473
It's killing me.

1469
01:51:36,475 --> 01:51:39,103
Make it stop. Oh.

1470
01:51:39,186 --> 01:51:41,063
Heart rate is decelerating.

1471
01:51:41,147 --> 01:51:43,232
What's happening?.

1472
01:51:43,315 --> 01:51:47,027
You have no lifeline, no soul.
You were never meant to be.

1473
01:51:47,111 --> 01:51:48,571
He's choking himself.

1474
01:51:48,654 --> 01:51:50,364
No.

1475
01:51:50,447 --> 01:51:54,493
Okay, let's do a rapid sequence
intubation for a c-section, stat.

1476
01:51:54,576 --> 01:51:58,038
Save him.
- Not getting enough oxygen.

1477
01:51:58,122 --> 01:52:01,166
We're losing him, we're losing him.
- No.

1478
01:52:01,250 --> 01:52:03,335
Before you were born.

1479
01:52:03,419 --> 01:52:05,963
I was pregnant three times,

1480
01:52:06,046 --> 01:52:08,340
but they were all stillbirths.

1481
01:52:08,424 --> 01:52:11,635
I've kind of thought of you
as my miracle baby ever since.

1482
01:52:12,761 --> 01:52:15,264
Not again.

1483
01:52:15,347 --> 01:52:18,475
No.

1484
01:52:20,102 --> 01:52:22,521
I couldn't stand my dad,

1485
01:52:22,604 --> 01:52:26,608
but I knew that if I went
to live with my mum.

1486
01:52:26,692 --> 01:52:29,278
I would never see you again.

1487
01:52:56,054 --> 01:52:58,431
Kayleigh and Tommy.

1488
01:53:01,017 --> 01:53:03,395
I missed you.

1489
01:53:03,478 --> 01:53:06,564
I'll never let you guys
out of my sight again.

1490
01:53:18,201 --> 01:53:21,037
Yeah.

1491
01:53:24,666 --> 01:53:27,210
True happiness can only
be achieved through sacrifice,

1492
01:53:27,293 --> 01:53:29,462
like the sacrifices
our parents have made.

1493
01:53:29,546 --> 01:53:32,090
Whoo-hoo. Great. Tommy.
