1
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,410
My name is Turkish.

2
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,790
Funny name for an Englishman,
I know.

3
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,420
My parents were on the same plane
when it crashed. That's how they met.

4
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,040
They named me after the plane.

5
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,840
Not many people are
named after a plane crash.

6
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,050
That's Tommy.

7
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,470
He tells people
he was named after a gun.

8
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,390
But I know he was really named after
a famous 19th-century ballet dancer.

9
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,020
Known him for as long as I can
remember. He's my partner.

10
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,690
Doesn't mean we hold hands
or take walks.

11
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:12,820
It means I try to keep him out of
as much trouble as he inflicts on me.

12
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,030
I give him a hard time.
Keeps him in check.

13
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,320
But really, he's like my brother.

14
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:23,080
What do I know about diamonds?
I'm a boxing promoter.

15
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,210
I was a happy boxing promoter
until a week ago, and then:

16
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,040
What do I know about diamonds?

17
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,380
Don't they come from Antwerp?

18
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,590
- Himy, would you listen to this?
- Do we have a choice?

19
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,300
It wasn't meant to be taken
literally.

20
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,010
It's a nice story, Adam and Eve.

21
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,600
It's bound with moral fibre...

22
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:49,440
...but asking a grown man
to believe it?

23
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,520
What is it?

24
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,280
Well, what is it?

25
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,910
What you want I should do,
drop my pants?

26
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,870
Okay, go through.

27
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,330
It's a nice story.

28
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,960
It's just that. Just a story.

29
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,670
Catholic religion is based
on a mistranslation.

30
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,170
Enough already.
Ruben, say something.

31
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,170
Listen. Are you busy?
I'll tell you the whole story.

32
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:23,640
The Septuagint scholars mistranslated
the Hebrew word for "young woman"...

33
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,060
...into the Greek word for "virgin."

34
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,730
It was an easy mistake to make...

35
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,520
...because there was only a subtle
difference in the spelling.

36
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,870
So, they came up with a prophecy:

37
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,290
"Behold, the virgin shall conceive
and bear us a son."

38
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,670
You understand? It was "virgin"
that caught people's attention.

39
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,050
It's not every day a virgin conceives
and bears a son.

40
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:19,400
But leave that for a couple
of hundred years to stew...

41
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:23,200
...and next thing you know you have
the Holy Catholic church.

42
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,620
Oy vay, what are you saying?

43
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,410
I'm saying, just because
it's written...

44
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,210
...doesn't make it so.

45
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:35,380
Gives them hope. It's not important
whether it's fact or fiction.

46
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:38,090
- People like to believe.
- I don't want to hear any more.

47
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,550
Anyway, who is it that we're seeing?

48
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,880
- Michael.
- Hello?

49
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,800
Mutti.

50
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,770
Rudy! Rud, Rud, let them in, please.

51
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,900
Rud, it's okay, let them through.

52
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,070
- Michael.
- Mutti.

53
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:03,070
You kept us waiting for half an hour.
Are you trying to give me heartburn?

54
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,740
Lie down on the floor.

55
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,330
Get on the floor!

56
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,880
Lie on the floor!

57
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,420
Get on the fucking floor!

58
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,920
- Get down!
- Get fucking down!

59
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,380
Down on the floor! Get down!

60
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,010
On the ground!

61
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,020
Get down, I say!

62
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,310
- Time.
- Seven minutes!

63
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:49,200
Where is the stone?

64
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,540
Michael, where is the stone?

65
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:24,290
When does your plane leave?

66
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,550
Twenty minutes.

67
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,880
Give me your gun.

68
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
When you get to London...

69
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,520
...if you want a gun...

70
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,570
...call this number.

71
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,370
- Boris.
- Boris.

72
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,870
He can get you anything you need.

73
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,920
Is he allowed to do that?

74
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:10,420
It's an unlicensed boxing match.
It's not a tickling competition.

75
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,720
These lads are out
to hurt each other.

76
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,600
What's with those sausages,
Charlie?

77
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,180
Two minutes, Turkish.

78
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:22,640
Look at it. How am I supposed
to run this thing from that?

79
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,350
We'll need a proper office.

80
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,570
I want a new one.
You're going to buy it for me.

81
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,400
Why me?

82
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,030
Well, you know about caravans.

83
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,700
How's that?

84
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,410
You spent a summer in one.
Which means you know more than me.

85
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,950
And I don't want to have me pants
pulled down over the price.

86
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,460
What's wrong with this one?

87
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,000
Oh, nothing, Tommy.

88
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,090
It's tiptop.

89
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,130
I'm just not sure about the colour.

90
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,510
It's all arranged.
You just got to pick it up.

91
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,550
Here's an address.

92
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,720
It's a campsite.

93
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,310
You've got 10 grand, and
it would be nice to see change.

94
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,270
- What's happening with the sausages?
- Five minutes.

95
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,110
It was two minutes five minutes ago.

96
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,950
They aren't pikeys, are they?

97
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,950
I fucking hate pikeys.

98
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,790
You're a sensitive boy, Tommy.

99
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,580
Fuck me. Hold tight.

100
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,670
- What's that?
- It's me belt.

101
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,250
No, Tommy. There's a gun
in your trousers.

102
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,670
- What's a gun doing in your trousers?
- It's for protection.

103
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,090
Protection from what?

104
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,180
"Zee" Germans?

105
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:41,600
What's to stop it blowing your
bollocks off when you sit?

106
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:45,060
- Where did you get it?
- Boris The Blade.

107
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,810
You mean Boris the sneaky
fucking Russian.

108
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,070
Heavy, isn't it?

109
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,860
Heavy is good.

110
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,450
Heavy is reliable.

111
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,320
If it doesn't work,
you can always hit him with it.

112
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:01,660
Boris The Blade,
or Boris The Bullet-Dodger.

113
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:05,250
Bent as the Soviet sickle and
hard as the hammer that crosses it.

114
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:10,170
Apparently, it's just impossible
to kill the bastard.

115
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,460
Back to my partner, Tommy.

116
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,340
Tommy runs the other business...

117
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,430
...the slot machines...

118
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,220
...which keeps rain off our heads
and gloves on Gorgeous' hands.

119
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:25,890
However, Tommy's a little preoccupied
with protection at present.

120
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,270
All right, I'll take it.

121
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:32,440
There's a reason for Tommy's
new found enthusiasm for firearms.

122
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:37,240
Sooner or later, in unlicensed boxing,
you have to deal with that reason:

123
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,660
Brick Top.

124
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,580
If that's not worth a bet,
I don't know what is.

125
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,910
- He doesn't look bad, does he?
- No, he looks great.

126
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,540
He'll do you proud.

127
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,920
You reckon that's what people should
do for me, Gary? Do me proud?

128
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,170
It's what you deserve.

129
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,800
Pull your tongue out of my arsehole.

130
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,090
Dogs do that.

131
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,590
You're not a dog, are you?

132
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,260
No. No, I'm not.

133
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,930
However...

134
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:07,430
...you do have all the characteristics
of a dog, Gary.

135
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,940
All except loyalty.

136
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:13,610
It's rumoured that his favourite means
of dispatch involves a stun gun...

137
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,990
...a plastic bag, a roll of tape
and a pack of hungry pigs.

138
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:22,620
You're a ruthless little cunt, Liam.
I'll give you that.

139
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:27,620
But I got no time for grouses.

140
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,790
Feed him to the pigs, Errol.

141
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,500
What the fuck are you two looking at?

142
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:42,800
If you got to deal with him, just make
sure you don't end up owing him.

143
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,220
Then you're in his debt.

144
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,680
Which means, you're in his pocket.

145
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:50,310
And once you're in that,
you aren't ever coming out.

146
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,060
I hear he's a good fighter,
so I'll use him.

147
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,520
I'll be doing you a favour, boy.

148
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,780
What he means is,
I'm doing him a favour.

149
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:05,030
Because everybody knows nobody
takes a dive in my fights. Unlike his.

150
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,950
Here, Errol, I don't think
he likes me.

151
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,040
You don't like me, do you?

152
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,500
Don't know what you mean.

153
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:14,960
I do know I can't wait to get
out of here. It stinks.

154
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:20,420
My fights finish prompt so we can get
out before the authorities find out.

155
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,880
Play your cards right
and I'll sort you out.

156
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,680
You can sort me out
by showing me out.

157
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,720
It's hard to make a living
in boxing, so now and then...

158
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:31,520
...you do something
against your principles.

159
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:34,770
Basically, you have to forget
you got any.

160
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,440
Are they Lancashire pigs?

161
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,230
Who's talking to you?

162
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:41,860
Oh, yeah, Tommy.
Brick Top loves Tommy.

163
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,280
Don't let me down.

164
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,870
You don't want to
let me down, do you?

165
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,040
See you ringside.

166
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:58,880
Boris, Franky-fucking-Four Fingers...

167
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,760
...has a diamond the size of a fist.

168
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:05,640
I have told you it's in the briefcase
connected to his arm.

169
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,100
I sent him to you to buy a gun.

170
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,140
What more do you want me to do,
hit him for you?

171
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,770
But don't you hit him either.

172
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,110
Americans can't know
it was Russian.

173
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,020
It will come back to me.

174
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,030
So, what should I do?

175
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,190
You're my brother, so think like it.

176
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,490
Get somebody else
to steal that stone!

177
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,830
I don't want it getting back to me.

178
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,950
And don't have him killed.
It will raise suspicion.

179
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,960
So don't use idiots for the job.

180
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:38,840
He'll stay in London a couple of
days before he goes to New York...

181
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,500
...so move quick. Okay?

182
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,970
It's okay.
I know a couple of guys.

183
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,800
One more thing.

184
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,600
It might help.

185
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,760
He loves to gamble.

186
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,310
Eighty-six carats?

187
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,520
Brilliant cut, beautiful make.

188
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,770
A beautiful stone.

189
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,070
You're a good boy, Franky.

190
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,400
And you did a real good job.
Now when do you get back?

191
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:09,450
I got to move the two-grainers here,
get a better price. Couple of days.

192
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,290
- Talk to my cousin Dougie.
- Doug The Head?

193
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,040
And Franky...

194
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,790
- And what?
- Stay out of those casinos.

195
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,840
You did a good job, Bubbe.

196
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:28,130
- Don't go screwing it up, all right?
- I hear you, Avi.

197
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,760
I'll see you, Avi.

198
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,270
Eighty-six karats.

199
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,190
- Where?
- London.

200
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,020
- London?
- London.

201
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,230
- London?
- Yes, London.

202
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,820
You know, fish, chips, cup of tea...

203
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:48,240
...bad food, worse weather,
Mary-fucking-Poppins. London!

204
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,240
Not for me.

205
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,620
That's Doug The Head.
Everybody knows Doug The Head.

206
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,620
If it's stones and it's stolen,
he's the man to speak to.

207
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,790
Pretends he's Jewish.
Wishes he was Jewish.

208
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,250
Even tells his family
they're Jewish...

209
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,760
...but he's about as Jewish
as he is a fucking monkey.

210
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:10,970
He thinks it's good for business.
And in the diamond business...

211
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,600
...it is good for business.
- Avi!

212
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,850
He'll be there today.
Take care of him.

213
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,810
Avi, you know I won't buy schtrops.

214
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,650
He isn't selling schtrops.
Make it smaller.

215
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,020
Who do you take me for?
This is England.

216
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,070
We play by the rules.

217
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,650
Listen to me.

218
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,200
If the stones are kosher,
then I'll buy them, won't I?

219
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:35,370
Now, if you'll excuse me,
it's my lunchtime. Bye.

220
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,830
What are you doing here?

221
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,960
It's a free country, isn't it?

222
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,050
Well, it isn't a free shop, is it?

223
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,170
So fuck off.

224
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,440
I want to see you two girls
up in my office.

225
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,820
I had cousin Avi on the phone.

226
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,780
- You got to go see him.
- Yeah, Dad. You told us.

227
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:12,360
- He's a big mucker in New York.
- Yeah, Dad. You told us.

228
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,070
I want to see you girls
up in my office.

229
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,790
Yeah, Dad. You told us.

230
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,880
The weight is sign of reliability.

231
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,710
I always go for reliability.

232
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,560
I'll take it.

233
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,390
How much do you want for it?

234
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,810
Nothing.

235
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,650
Okay, so what do you want for it?

236
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,480
I want you to do something for me.

237
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,400
There is a fight in couple of days.

238
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,200
What kind of a fight?

239
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,120
Unlicensed boxing.

240
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,500
There is a bookies I know
that will take bets.

241
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,290
If you place one down for me...

242
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,420
...we will call it quits.

243
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,960
- Why don't you put it down yourself?
- Well...

244
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:16,640
...there is not too many bookies
that takes those kind of bets.

245
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:21,020
And I already have an outstanding
debt with the house.

246
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,810
I know something most don't.

247
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,150
So, nu?

248
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,860
What do you know?

249
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,370
It's a campsite. A pikey campsite.

250
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,620
- Ten points.
- What are we doing here?

251
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,710
- We're buying a caravan.
- Off a pack of fucking pikeys?

252
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,630
What's wrong with you?
This will get messy.

253
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,920
Not if you're here.

254
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:51,960
Oh, you bastard.

255
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,760
I fucking hate pikeys.

256
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,220
That's a flash car, mister.

257
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,890
Not as flash as your bike.

258
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,060
Who are you looking for?

259
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,600
Mr. O'Neil.

260
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,520
- Want me to get him?
- That's a good lad.

261
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,520
Piss off.

262
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,070
- Are you going to go get him for me?
- Yeah.

263
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:17,110
- What are you waiting for?
- The five quid you'll pay me.

264
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,950
Fuck off, I'll find him meself.

265
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,530
- Two fifty.
- You can have a quid.

266
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,370
You're a real tight fucker.

267
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,460
There was a problem with gypsies.

268
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,580
What're you doing?
Get out of the way, man.

269
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,670
You can't understand
what's being said.

270
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,460
You Tommy?
Come about the caravan?

271
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,960
- Mr. O'Neil.
- Fuck, man. Call me Mickey.

272
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,800
Not Irish, not English.

273
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:38,260
- How are you?
- Weather's been kind.

274
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,220
It's just Pikey.

275
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,600
Would you look at the size of him?

276
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,680
How big are you?

277
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,850
- Kids, how big is he?
- Big, for sure.

278
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,810
Hey, Mam, come and look at the size
of this fella.

279
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:55,280
Bet you box a little, can't you, sir?
You look like a boxer.

280
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:58,110
Get out of the way.
See if they'd like a drink.

281
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,700
I could murder one.

282
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,950
Be no murdering done around here,
I don't mind telling you.

283
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,200
Get your hands out of there.

284
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,080
Cup of tea for the big fella?

285
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,420
Don't be silly, Mickey.
Offer the man a proper drink.

286
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,130
You little bugger.

287
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,550
- Is the big fella not coming with us?
- He's minding the car.

288
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,590
- What does he think we are, thieves?
- No, nothing like that.

289
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,930
- He just likes looking after cars.
- Good dags. Do you like dags?

290
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,970
- Dags?
- What?

291
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,890
- Yeah, dags.
- Dags. You like dags?

292
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,190
Oh, dogs.

293
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,520
Sure, I like dags.

294
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,570
- I like caravans more.
- You're very welcome.

295
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:50,210
Pikeys are well-known for their
skills of negotiation in business.

296
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,460
It's probably why
they talk like that...

297
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,840
...so you can't follow
what's being said.

298
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:58,550
But if Tommy can get the caravan
for less than the price asked...

299
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,130
...on his return
there will be ice cream.

300
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,680
Good dog, good family.

301
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:06,640
He'll get a little homesick,
but he'll get over it.

302
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,770
See you later, lads. See you, boss.

303
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,190
All right, Mickey. Laters.

304
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,150
I don't see what the fuss is about.

305
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,150
They aren't bad fellas.

306
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,580
The deal was, you bought it
how you saw it.

307
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:32,920
Look, I've helped you as much
as I'm going to help you.

308
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,000
See that car? Use it.

309
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,880
You should fuck off now while
you still got the legs to carry you.

310
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,090
Nobody brings you...

311
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,220
...unless they're trying
to say something without talking.

312
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,140
Just give our money back
and you can keep your caravan.

313
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:52,390
Why do I want a caravan
that's got no wheels?

314
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,770
- You want to settle this with a fight?
- Over my dead body.

315
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,360
Now, go on! Go on!

316
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:01,570
I'll not have you fighting! You know
what happens when you fight!

317
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,570
Get her to sit down.

318
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,910
For fuck's sake!

319
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,830
Want the money?
I isn't fucked you.

320
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,630
I'll fight you for it. You and me.

321
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,970
So that's the kind of fight
it'll be.

322
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,390
You want to stay down.

323
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,860
You want to stay down!

324
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:46,410
Get back down
and fucking stay down.

325
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,080
I promise you,
you want to stay down.

326
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,410
Deadly kick for a fat fucker,
you know that?

327
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,660
Cheeky bastard.

328
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,420
- Okay, lads.
- Get him on his feet.

329
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,970
Get back down...

330
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,010
...or you will not be coming up
next time.

331
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,430
Bollocks to you.

332
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,890
This is sick. I'm out of here.

333
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,650
You're not going anywhere,
you thick lump.

334
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,900
You stay until the job's done.

335
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:59,650
It turned out that the sweet-talking,
tattoo-sporting pikey...

336
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:02,650
...was a gypsy bare-knuckle
boxing champion.

337
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,610
Which makes him harder
than a coffin nail.

338
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:10,160
Right now that's the last thing
on Tommy's mind.

339
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,080
If Gorgeous doesn't wake up
in the next few minutes...

340
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,580
...Tommy knows he'll be buried
with him.

341
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:18,870
Why would the gypsies
want to explain...

342
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,330
...why a man died in their campsite?

343
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,750
Not when they can bury the pair
of them and just move camp.

344
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:28,510
It's not like they got
social security numbers, is it?

345
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,090
Tommy, "The Tit"...

346
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,010
...is praying.

347
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,510
And if he isn't...

348
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,810
...he fucking should be.

349
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,800
Bad Boy.

350
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,050
- Sol.
- Easy.

351
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,050
No, it's a moissanite.

352
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,220
A what?

353
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,890
A moissanite is an artificial
diamond, Lincoln.

354
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,180
It's Mickey Mouse.

355
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,180
Spurious.

356
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,390
Not genuine.

357
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,560
And it's worth...

358
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,060
...fuck-all.

359
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,360
Bad Boy, I keep telling you,
stick to being a gangster.

360
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,400
Leave this game to me and Sol.

361
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,070
Laters.

362
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:37,990
What is that, Vince?

363
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,910
This is a dog, Sol.

364
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,370
You are not bringing
that thing in here.

365
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,250
It's only a fucking dog.

366
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,090
- Where'd you get it?
- The gyppos.

367
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,420
Here.

368
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,670
They threw it in with the moody gold.

369
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,430
You know gyppos, Sol. They're always
throwing dogs in with deals.

370
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,050
It better not be dangerous.

371
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,060
What do you think you're doing now?

372
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,310
I want him to get used
to the shop, don't I?

373
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,940
Stop the dog!

374
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,360
Come back!

375
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,440
All right, Boris?

376
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,450
- Don't worry about the dog.
- I'm not.

377
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,330
What can I do for you?

378
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,830
I have a job for you.

379
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,790
I already have a job.

380
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,500
Fifty grand for half a day's work.

381
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:28,880
Go on.

382
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:32,420
I want you to hold up a bookies.

383
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,970
From Russia with love, eh?

384
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:42,100
I have stones to sell...

385
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:45,440
...fat to chew and many men
to see about many ducks...

386
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,230
...so if I am not rushing you...

387
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,280
Slow down, Franky, my son.
When in Rome.

388
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,820
I am not in Rome, Doug.

389
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,780
I am in a rush.

390
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,660
I got to make the bookies.

391
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,990
Bookies?

392
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,330
- What are you betting on?
- Bomber Harris.

393
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,500
The unlicensed boxer?

394
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,250
Do you know something that I don't?

395
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,430
Bubbe, I probably know
a lot you don't.

396
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:20,350
He's bad to the bone,
isn't you, Tyrone?

397
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,810
Of course I am.

398
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,850
Tyrone will drive for us.
He's done a rally driving course.

399
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,310
Of course I have.

400
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,900
I don't want that dog
dribbling on my seats.

401
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,650
Your seats?

402
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,150
Tyrone, this is a stolen car, mate.

403
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,320
While I'm at the wheel, it's my car...

404
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:43,950
...so stop that dog dribbling
on my seats. All right?

405
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,080
I can't believe you found it.
Where'd it go?

406
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:49,040
It went back to the gyppos.

407
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:52,000
Shut up.
And how could it find them?

408
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,510
Well, I don't know.
I'm not a dog, Sol.

409
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,380
Ask him.

410
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,340
It's like he's
a fucking homing beacon.

411
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,430
Steady on the brakes.

412
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,930
I thought you said
he could drive, Sol.

413
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:10,020
Don't worry about me. Just worry
about that dog on my seats.

414
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,730
All right?

415
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,540
What?

416
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:37,630
You said he was a getaway driver.
What the fuck can he get away from?

417
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,720
Don't worry about Tyrone.
He can move when he has to.

418
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,510
Worry about getting us a gun.

419
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:48,890
What's that?

420
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:52,400
This is a shotgun, Sol.

421
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:55,440
It's a fucking
anti-aircraft gun, Vincent.

422
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:59,700
- I want to raise pulses, don't I?
- You'll raise hell, never mind pulses.

423
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,380
That does not look like a bookies.

424
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:24,850
Why'd we stop here? What's the matter
with that space over there?

425
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,010
It's too tight.

426
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,140
Too tight?

427
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,270
You could land a
jumbo-fucking-jet in there.

428
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,730
Leave him alone.
He's a natural. Isn't you, Tyrone?

429
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,610
Of course I am.

430
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,750
A natural fucking idiot.
Tyrone, what've you done?

431
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,080
Yeah, Tyrone, what have you done?

432
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,090
Look, you hassle me,
you see what happens.

433
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,760
It's all right.
No, don't move it now.

434
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,630
People will see the damage.
Why'd you do that?

435
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,890
I didn't see it.

436
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,060
It's a four-ton truck. It's not like
it's a packet of fucking peanuts.

437
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,970
It was at a funny angle.

438
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,020
It's behind you, Tyrone.

439
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,690
Whenever you reverse,
things come from behind you.

440
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,650
Control that dog as well.

441
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,700
- Get that dog off him.
- Get it off me.

442
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,530
Give me that squeaky toy.
It shut him up last time.

443
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:33,410
Don't snatch.

444
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,290
He can't swallow the whole ball.

445
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:41,340
Yeah.

446
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,880
Why the fuck...

447
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,510
...did you put Gorgeous George...

448
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,390
...into a bare-knuckle boxing match...

449
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,930
...two days before
he had to fight The Bomber?

450
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:57,480
He was half his size.
I didn't expect him to get hurt.

451
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:01,940
You put the man into
a bare-knuckle boxing match.

452
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,570
What the fuck did you expect?

453
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,160
A grease-down and a shiatsu?

454
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,830
Who took the jam
out of your doughnut?

455
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,540
You took the fucking jam
out of my doughnut.

456
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,160
You did.

457
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:18,380
You said get a good deal.

458
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,090
I fail to recognise
the correlation...

459
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:24,510
...between losing 10 grand,
hospitalising Gorgeous...

460
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:26,050
...and a good deal.

461
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,430
How'll we explain this to Brick Top?

462
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,550
That his fight won't happen?

463
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,470
We replace the fighter.

464
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,560
Oh, and hope he doesn't notice?

465
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,690
Who the fuck will we
replace him with?

466
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,690
What about John The Gun?

467
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,400
Or Mad Fist Willy?

468
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,860
You're not Mr. Current Affairs,
are you?

469
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,110
Mad Fist went mad...

470
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,030
...and The Gun shot himself.

471
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,250
Jesus.

472
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:02,340
- What?
- Let's use the fucking pikey.

473
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,130
- How much you going to pay us?
- 10 K.

474
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,680
Me bollocks. Lose more
than that running for the bus.

475
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,020
All right.

476
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:22,230
I'll do it for a caravan.

477
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,980
A what?

478
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,400
A caravan.

479
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:29,240
- Top of the range and all that.
- It was us that wanted a caravan.

480
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,910
Anyway, what's wrong with this one?

481
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,330
It's not for me.
It's for me ma.

482
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,160
Your what?

483
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,580
His ma.

484
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,190
Brick Top runs an illegal bookies.

485
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,910
They take bets on anything
that involves blood and pain.

486
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,530
Now I'm changing fighters...

487
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,240
...and Brick Top's going to
exploit the situation.

488
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:20,120
He's going to pull my pants down,
grease me up...

489
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,710
...and aim for penetration.

490
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,090
If I didn't have
the replacement pikey...

491
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,630
...he'd want to split me in half.

492
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,760
They could charm the paint off walls,
these fellas.

493
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:44,150
Look mean now,
you hairy fucker, won't you?

494
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,230
Shits himself when
you put him in the ring.

495
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,990
Poke him with a stick,
you watch his bollocks grow.

496
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,820
Do you like a dog fight, Turkish?

497
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,910
We've lost Gorgeous George.

498
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,920
You're going to have to repeat that.

499
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:06,080
We've lost Gorgeous George.

500
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,460
Well, where'd you lose him?

501
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:11,260
He isn't a set
of fucking car keys, is he?

502
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:14,260
And it's not as if he's
incon-fucking-spicuous, is it?

503
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,470
We're not backing out.

504
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,600
You bet your bollocks to
a barn dance you're not.

505
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,270
We're changing the fighter.

506
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:25,100
Oh, fuck me,
your lady friend got a voice?

507
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,520
Who are you changing him to,
sweetheart?

508
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:30,110
You won't know him,
but he's mustard.

509
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,530
Mustard?

510
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:35,360
I don't care if he's
Muhammad "I'm Hard" Bruce Lee...

511
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,030
...you can't change fighters.

512
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,450
- You've still got your fight.
- No.

513
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:42,870
I lose all bets at the bookies.
You can't change fighters.

514
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,960
So, no, I don't have my fight,
do I, you fucking prat?

515
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:48,920
You can take bets at the fight.

516
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,800
Put a lead on her, Turkish,
before she gets bitten.

517
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,380
Do you want to get bitten,
sweetheart?

518
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:02,430
Make sure your man goes down
in the fourth.

519
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:06,020
You understand me now,
don't you, Turkish?

520
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,820
This is the one place
I didn't want to be:

521
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,320
In his debt.

522
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:14,150
Which now means I'm in his pocket.

523
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,240
You're on thin fucking ice,
my pedigree chums.

524
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,160
And I shall be under it
when it breaks.

525
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:22,660
Now, fuck off.

526
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:34,170
Doug, where's Franky Four Fingers?

527
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:37,550
I don't know. I'm not his mother.
But I'm seeing him later.

528
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,390
- When later?
- He said he wanted cash.

529
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,680
So he's coming back
after he's been to a fight.

530
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,610
A fight?

531
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:56,190
What do you mean, a fight?
A boxing match?

532
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:01,070
- Is there gambling involved?
- It's a boxing match, Avi.

533
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,870
- Did he have a case with him?
- Yes, he had a case.

534
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,790
And this schmuck is gambling?

535
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:10,710
You're talking about Franky "I've got
a problem with gambling" Four Fingers.

536
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,540
Avi, I'm not telepathic.

537
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,880
You're plenty stupid,
I'll give you that.

538
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:17,720
Do you know why they call him
Franky Four Fingers?

539
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,300
I have no idea.

540
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:22,720
Because he makes stupid bets
with dangerous people.

541
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:25,430
When he doesn't pay up,
they give him the chop.

542
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,810
And I'm not talking about
his fucking foreskin.

543
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,480
I'm sure he can pay.

544
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:33,480
Not with my goods. Got a toothbrush?
We're going to London.

545
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:36,070
Do you hear that?
I'm coming to London!

546
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:43,830
- Avi!
- Shut up and sit down, you bald fuck!

547
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:48,660
I don't like leaving my own country...

548
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:53,090
...especially leaving it for anything
less than warm, sandy beaches...

549
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:55,840
...and cocktails
with little straw hats.

550
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,380
We've got sandy beaches.

551
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:00,470
So who the fuck wants to see them?

552
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:04,640
I hope you can appreciate the concern
I have for my friend Franky.

553
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:07,180
I'll find him,
and you'll help me find him.

554
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:09,430
And we'll start at that fight.

555
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,440
How am I going to get it out?

556
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,440
It will probably cough it up.

557
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:16,940
Will he be all right?

558
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,440
I hope not.

559
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:21,910
- Are we going to rob this bookies?
- Yes, big man.

560
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,280
Why are we waiting?

561
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:26,990
We are waiting for a man with
four fingers, carrying a briefcase.

562
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,160
And why's that?

563
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:33,290
Because the deal is, the Russian
gets the case, we get the money.

564
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,000
What's in the case?

565
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:39,510
For fuck's sake, Tyrone, just
concentrate on the steering wheel.

566
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,300
Jesus.

567
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:45,800
- Private night tonight, chaps.
- I'm well aware of that, my son.

568
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:47,720
That's why we're here.

569
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,730
Well done. This is the back way in.

570
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,980
Oh, really?
I thought it was the front.

571
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:58,020
- Private night tonight, chaps.
- We know. That's why we're here.

572
00:35:58,690 --> 00:35:59,820
Tickets.

573
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:02,490
Are we ever going to get into this place?

574
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,570
Avi, Avi, you got to understand.

575
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,660
This isn't exactly Vegas,
and this isn't exactly legal.

576
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:11,750
I'm not looking for Vegas
or for legal.

577
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,830
I'm looking for Franky.

578
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,500
I know that,
and he said he's going to be here.

579
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:20,590
- If there's gambling, he'll be here.
- Let's not have a fuck-up.

580
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,170
You won't let us down.

581
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:26,340
He's going down in the fourth,
don't you worry about that.

582
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,180
Is that him?

583
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:33,520
I don't know.
How many fingers did he have?

584
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:35,850
Sorry, I didn't get
the binoculars out in time.

585
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,860
Let's not stand on ceremony.
Let's start the show.

586
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,880
Do you know who
this bookies belongs to?

587
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,960
If you know what's good for you
you'll give me everything...

588
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,050
What are you doing?

589
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,720
What does it look like
I'm doing up here?

590
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:14,770
This is starting to hurt, Solomon.

591
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,270
Drop the screen now.

592
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,690
How you doing, Vince?

593
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,320
I'd do a lot better
if you'd stop using my name.

594
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:26,570
- Fill that bag.
- All bets are off.

595
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:30,580
I am not in here
to make a fucking bet.

596
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:31,990
Appreciated...

597
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,120
...but all bets...

598
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,080
...are...

599
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:38,460
...off.

600
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:42,840
If all bets are off, there can't be
any money, can there?

601
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,720
I isn't fucking buying that.

602
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:50,430
That's handy because I isn't
fucking selling it. It's a fact.

603
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:52,810
What have you got?

604
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,180
Nothing, really.

605
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,770
A few coins, but no notes.

606
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:03,610
Show me your hands.

607
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,450
You've got five fingers.

608
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,780
Copper coins.

609
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:15,660
What do you mean,
copper fucking coins?

610
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:28,300
It won't open
because it's a security door.

611
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,630
Hold that.

612
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:40,100
My leg.

613
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,570
What are you moaning about?
It didn't even touch it.

614
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,490
We're fucked.

615
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,880
What the fuck are you two doing?

616
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,430
Get us out of here.

617
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:20,060
Tyrone, what are you doing?
Get us out of here!

618
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,530
Who the fuck is this man, Tyrone?

619
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:37,160
He's a man with four fingers
and a briefcase, Vinny.

620
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:40,870
In the red corner...

621
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,630
...we have the young
and unchallenged...

622
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:48,130
So, Mickey, you're going down
in the fourth. Is that clear?

623
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,050
Just make sure he doesn't kill me.

624
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:54,140
So give it up
for the bone-crunching...

625
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:56,510
...one-punch machine gun...

626
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,640
...Mickey!

627
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:07,070
And in the other corner...

628
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:09,360
Now, I know he looks
like a fat fucker...

629
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:12,490
Well, he is a fat fucker,
but he's dirty and he's dangerous.

630
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:17,580
Bomber "The Mad Man" Harris!

631
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:22,370
Now, try and look like a fighter.

632
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:25,080
Let's get ready...

633
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,420
...to rumble!

634
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:04,660
Do you realise I'm
fucking forty grand down?

635
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,080
What's the fucking crack?

636
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:09,000
- I'll make it up to you.
- I isn't happy.

637
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:12,670
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
Stand on me.

638
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,010
Oh, that fucking pikey's
put me in it.

639
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,890
Thanks for the tip, Brick Top.

640
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:23,060
Listen, you fucking fringe,
if I throw a dog a bone...

641
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,190
...I don't want to know
if it tastes good.

642
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:30,150
Stop me again whilst I'm walking and
I'll cut your fucking Jacobs off.

643
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,800
- He's here.
- Well, you explain it to him.

644
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:04,720
- What you doing?
- The case was attached to his arm.

645
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:07,350
So why didn't you chop it off?

646
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,850
We isn't fucking butchers, Boris.

647
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:11,480
But he has the case.

648
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:14,360
Look, we...
Well, you have a problem.

649
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,860
There weren't much cash
at the bookies.

650
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:19,990
Okay.

651
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,870
Here is the 10 grand.

652
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,160
No. Keep it. We want this.

653
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:29,000
Well, at least half of this.

654
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,040
What was in the case was mine.

655
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:35,590
What was in the bookies was yours.
Okay?

656
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,720
It wasn't much, but here is
the 10 large to help the situation.

657
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:41,720
No, I'm afraid
it's too late for that.

658
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:45,430
We want half of this, and that's
because we're being generous.

659
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,850
We could, by all rights, keep
the whole fucking stone, Boris.

660
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,780
Watch out!

661
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,950
Drop the gun, fat boy.

662
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:12,540
You fucking idiots.
He could not know my name.

663
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:15,300
Give me the stone.

664
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,880
- It's in the case.
- What?

665
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,260
It's in the case.

666
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:23,140
You put the stone in the case?

667
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,140
Open it and give me the stone.

668
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:31,390
The only man who knew
the combination, you just shot.

669
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:04,800
Now, it's not too clever to hang
about after Mickey's performance.

670
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:10,060
Brick Top, in short, will be looking
to kill Tommy, Mickey and myself.

671
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:13,940
I know he's looking for us,
but I don't have a choice.

672
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:18,820
I'm happy to leave the country,
but I need money to do so.

673
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:22,820
But any money I have is in the safe,
which is in the office.

674
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:24,820
Once I have that, it's...

675
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:26,160
Oink, oink.

676
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:27,990
Shit.

677
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:32,120
So that's where you keep the sugar.

678
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,000
What brings you two here?
Run out of pants to sniff?

679
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,460
That sounds like hostility,
doesn't it?

680
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:42,970
And we don't like hostility,
do we, Errol?

681
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,300
No, we don't, John.

682
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:59,730
I just had them polished.

683
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,860
Go and put the kettle on.

684
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:13,710
- You take sugar?
- No, thank you, Turkish.

685
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,370
I'm sweet enough.

686
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:27,180
He is now your problem.

687
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,850
Okay?

688
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:42,070
You can keep the 10 grand,
along with the body...

689
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:45,530
...but if I see you again,
you motherfuckers...

690
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:50,070
Well, look at him.

691
00:45:57,250 --> 00:46:00,290
I've got a bare-knuckle fight
in a couple of days.

692
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,880
I want to use the pikey.

693
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:04,840
All right. Of course.

694
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:07,300
Of course, fucking of course.

695
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:10,050
I wasn't asking, I was telling.

696
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,220
But this time...

697
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:16,850
...I do want him to go down
in the fourth.

698
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:21,810
And I do mean it, this time.

699
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:35,080
Now, I know you come back here
to open your safe.

700
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:40,040
So now you can open it.

701
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,710
Turkish has been a busy
little bastard.

702
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,710
I think he's got away with enough.

703
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,010
Thinking can get you into trouble,
Errol. I shouldn't do so much of it.

704
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:51,180
That takes care of one little piggy.

705
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:54,260
Now find me the silly sods
who blagged the bookies.

706
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,770
Find them today.

707
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,250
Top of the morning
to you, Mrs. O'Neil.

708
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,160
Tommy.

709
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:23,710
You're a snake in the grass,
isn't you? Where'd they come from?

710
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,210
You're looking for my boy, are you?

711
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:28,920
- Do you know where I can find him?
- Yeah.

712
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,180
Would you like
to share that information?

713
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:34,800
I don't want you getting
my boy into trouble.

714
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:39,310
He's my only boy.
And he's a good boy.

715
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:42,270
He's coursing.

716
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,360
What's coursing?

717
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,570
Hare coursing.

718
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,360
They set two lurchers...
They're dogs, before you ask.

719
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,820
On a hare.

720
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:58,540
And the hare has to outrun the dogs.

721
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,830
So, what if it doesn't?

722
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:05,670
Well, the big rabbit gets fucked,
doesn't it?

723
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:10,880
Proper fucked?

724
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:12,930
Yeah, Tommy.

725
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,510
Before "zee" Germans get there.

726
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,560
Do you know these tits, Errol?

727
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:21,230
I know a lot of tits...

728
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:24,400
...but I don't know any
as fucking stupid as these two.

729
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:25,810
John?

730
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,320
I can't help, guv.

731
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,490
Tyrone.

732
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:37,580
You silly, fat bastard.

733
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,910
- Do you want to do it?
- That depends.

734
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,080
On what?

735
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:45,210
On you buying this caravan.

736
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:47,840
Not the rouge one. The rose.

737
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:50,590
- It's not the same caravan.
- Not the same fight.

738
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,760
It's twice the size of the last one.

739
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:56,010
The fight is twice the size.
And me ma needs a caravan.

740
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:59,220
I like to look after me ma.
It's a fair deal. Take it.

741
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:03,520
You're lucky we aren't worm food
after your last performance.

742
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:06,980
Buying a tart's mobile palace
is a little fucking rich.

743
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:12,860
I wasn't calling your mum a tart.
I just meant...

744
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:15,400
Save your breath for cooling
your porridge.

745
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:27,540
Right. And she's terrible
partial to the periwinkle blue.

746
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:31,250
Have I made myself clear?

747
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:35,680
Yeah, that's perfectly clear, Mickey.

748
00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:39,220
Just give me one minute
to confer with my colleague.

749
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:46,100
Did you understand a word
of what he said?

750
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:50,230
I'll tell you what.

751
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,110
Fucker.

752
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:55,190
I'll bet you for it.

753
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:56,740
You'll what?

754
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:58,320
He'll bet you for it.

755
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:01,780
What, like Tommy did last time?
Do me a favour?

756
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:03,490
I'll do you a favour.

757
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:06,410
You have first bet.
If I win, I get a caravan...

758
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:08,750
...and the boys get
a pair of them shoes.

759
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,630
If I lose...

760
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,840
...fuck it, I'll do the fight
for free.

761
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,640
The last thing I really
want to do is bet a pikey.

762
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:25,020
However, I don't really
have much of a choice.

763
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:28,890
Somehow I've got to get him to fight,
but if I lose...

764
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:32,360
Well, I don't even want
to think about losing.

765
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:36,490
Okay. I reckon the hare gets fucked.

766
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,700
What? Proper fucked?

767
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:42,660
You got that, London?

768
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:43,910
We're on!

769
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:59,030
I'll fucking tell you!
Get those off me.

770
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:01,400
I'll tell you
who robbed your bookies.

771
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:21,130
Periwinkle blue. Bye, boys.

772
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:25,510
Who's proper fucked now, then?

773
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:29,310
There's something very wrong
with this.

774
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:32,810
It was us that wanted
to buy a caravan off of him.

775
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:38,190
Well, why didn't you "bust a cap
in his ass" then, Tommy?

776
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:41,940
Mind you, you'd do more damage
if you threw it at him.

777
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:44,660
What? You saying I can't shoot?

778
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:48,450
Oh, no, Tommy.
I wasn't saying you can't shoot.

779
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:50,540
I know you can't shoot.

780
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:54,960
What we're saying is, that piece
of shit stuck in your trousers...

781
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,330
...would do more damage
if you fed it to him.

782
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:59,090
You saying the gun don't work?

783
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:00,670
You tried it?

784
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:06,970
Whoops.

785
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:12,520
I want to see
that sneaky fucking Russian.

786
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:15,480
Why's he got a tea cosy on his head?

787
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:17,610
To keep his head warm.

788
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:20,320
- What happened to him?
- He got shot in the face.

789
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:22,030
I thought that was obvious.

790
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:24,610
What'd you do that for?
You mistake him for a rabbit?

791
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:27,280
- What do you want me to do?
- Sort it out.

792
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:30,370
- I'm not a witch doctor.
- But you are a bad boy yardie...

793
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:33,450
...and bad boy yardies should
know how to get rid of bodies.

794
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:36,460
I create the bodies,
I don't erase the bodies.

795
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:44,590
We're in, governor.

796
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:48,390
Goody gumdrops.

797
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,970
Get us a cup of tea,
would you, Errol?

798
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:53,930
Grab hold of his legs.

799
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:57,020
What do you think
I'm going to grab him by, his ears?

800
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:10,120
Hope this is not a bad moment.

801
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,410
Do you know who I am?

802
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,250
I do.

803
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:30,260
Good. That will save me
some time, then.

804
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:33,470
Well, I don't.

805
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:45,690
You're always going to have problems
lifting a body in one piece.

806
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:48,150
Apparently, the best thing to do...

807
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:53,030
...is cut up a corpse into six pieces
and pile it all together.

808
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:56,580
Would someone mind telling me,
who are you?

809
00:54:56,790 --> 00:54:59,830
When you got your six pieces,
you got to get rid of them.

810
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:03,540
It's no good leaving it in the freezer
for your mum to discover.

811
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:12,890
Then I hear the best thing
to do is feed them to pigs.

812
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:16,560
You got to starve the pigs
for a few days...

813
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:20,020
...then the chopped-up body
will look like curry to a pisshead.

814
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:25,070
You got to shave the heads of your
victims and pull the teeth out...

815
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,820
...for the piggies' digestion.

816
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:29,320
You could do this afterwards,
of course...

817
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:32,110
...but you don't want
to sieve through pigshit, do you?

818
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:36,990
They will go through bone like butter.

819
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:41,290
You need at least 16 pigs
to finish the job in one sitting...

820
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:45,540
...so be wary of any man
who keeps a pig farm.

821
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:48,960
They will go through a body
that weighs 200 pounds...

822
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:51,130
...in about eight minutes.

823
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:53,010
That means that a single pig...

824
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:56,930
...can consume two pounds
of uncooked flesh...

825
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:59,310
...every minute.

826
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,770
Hence the expression...

827
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:05,360
..."as greedy as a pig."

828
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:13,450
Well, thank you for that.
That's a great weight off me mind.

829
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:16,870
Now, if you wouldn't mind telling me
who the fuck you are...

830
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:20,040
...apart from someone who feeds
people to pigs, of course.

831
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:26,210
Do you know what "nemesis" means?

832
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:34,010
"A righteous infliction
of retribution...

833
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:37,930
...manifested by an
appropriate agent."

834
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:43,060
Personified, in this case,
by a horrible cunt:

835
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,060
Me.

836
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,240
Gentlemen...

837
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:27,940
Why can't you find me Franky, Doug?

838
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:32,990
Avi, what do you want me to do?
I'm not a bounty hunter.

839
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:35,780
What about Tony?

840
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:37,240
Bullet-Tooth Tony.

841
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:38,410
Who's Bullet-Tooth...?

842
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,700
- Tony!
- You silly fuck.

843
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:41,950
He's a liability.

844
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:44,370
He'd find Moses
and the burning bush.

845
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:46,040
You are going to die, Tony!

846
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:49,540
He got shot six times,
had the bullets moulded into gold.

847
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:52,130
I shoot you, you go down!

848
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:55,170
He has two in his teeth
that Dad did, so he loves Dad.

849
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:58,090
Why don't you fucking die?

850
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:01,010
- He's the best chance you got.
- Six times?

851
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,970
In one sitting.

852
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:06,520
You're in trouble now.

853
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:10,400
Sounds promising.
What are we waiting for?

854
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:23,990
Bonjour.

855
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,830
What's so fucking important?

856
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,290
Why do you think
we've got a dead man...

857
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:35,340
...missing an arm in our office?
- Talk to me, tell me.

858
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:37,340
You give us four days...

859
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:41,260
...Ill get you a stone the size
of a fucking home. I kid you not.

860
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:42,680
What do you think, Errol?

861
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:46,180
I think we should drip-dry them,
while we got the chance.

862
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:48,640
It was a rhetorical question, Errol.

863
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:51,520
What have I told you about thinking?

864
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:54,320
- You got 48 hours.
- Yeah.

865
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:57,860
You can keep that silly, fat wanker.
The lads can't lift him.

866
00:58:58,070 --> 00:58:59,320
Forty-eight hours.

867
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:01,030
After that it's your family...

868
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,120
...and the pigs finish
what the dogs don't do.

869
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:10,500
So, what should I call you?
Should I call you "Bullet"? "Tooth"?

870
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:12,380
Call me "Susan"
if it makes you happy.

871
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:16,050
Tony, there is a man
I'd like you to find.

872
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:19,970
That depends on all the elements
in the equation. How many are there?

873
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:21,260
Forty thousand.

874
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,760
Where was he last seen?

875
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:27,640
At a bookies.

876
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:29,560
Bookies?

877
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:33,690
Pass us the blower, Susi.

878
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:40,820
- Bookies got blagged last night.
- Blagged? Speak English.

879
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:45,780
This country spawned the language,
and nobody seems to speak it.

880
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,410
Blagged, robbed.

881
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:50,000
We'll see a man
that may know something.

882
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:52,000
I need a gun.

883
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:55,340
You don't, Rosebud, me old son.
You need me.

884
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:00,220
I got fucking black ink all
over fuck boy.

885
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:02,550
He's stained for fucking life.

886
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,510
That and the golden teeth as well.
Fucking hell...

887
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:07,100
All right, Mullet?

888
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:13,810
How you doing?
You all right, mate?

889
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:15,940
Nice tie.

890
01:00:16,110 --> 01:00:17,900
I heard you weren't about that much.

891
01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:21,320
Still warm, the blood
that courses through my veins.

892
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:23,740
Unlike yours, Mullet.

893
01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:26,070
Who blagged Brick Top's bookies?

894
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:29,620
- Do me a favour, Tone.
- I will do you a favour, Mullet.

895
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:33,620
I'll not bash the fuck out of you
in front of all your girlfriends.

896
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:38,090
Going to make it worth my while, mate?
Jesus, you know how it is, man.

897
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:43,970
Comfortable, Mullet?

898
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:47,260
It's sadly ironic it's that tie
that's got you into this pickle.

899
01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:50,310
Now, you take all
the time you want, mate.

900
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:52,600
What the fuck you doing, Tone?

901
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:55,440
Driving down the street
with your head in my window.

902
01:00:56,270 --> 01:00:59,690
- What you think I'm doing?
- Well, don't, Tone.

903
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:02,780
You been using dog shit
for toothpaste?

904
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:04,280
Slow down, Tone.

905
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:06,620
Slow down, Tony!

906
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:09,410
I don't think so.
I think I'll speed up.

907
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:12,950
Play some music if you like.

908
01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:16,210
I love this track.

909
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:20,090
I want to know who blagged
Brick Top's bookies.

910
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:21,800
Yes, Mullet?

911
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:27,300
I think it's two black guys that work
from a pawnshop in Smith Street.

912
01:01:27,470 --> 01:01:29,350
Better not be telling me porky pies.

913
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:35,140
I tell you, it's two black guys work
out of a pawnshop on Smith Street.

914
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,770
It's very effective, Tony.

915
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:40,070
It's not too subtle, but effective.

916
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:43,110
Are we taking him with us?

917
01:01:52,410 --> 01:01:53,540
It's the Russian.

918
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:55,710
A Russian?

919
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,540
To be technical he's an Uzbekistanian.

920
01:01:58,790 --> 01:02:03,340
Uzbekistanian? I've been dealing
with those sneaky Russian dogs.

921
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:05,840
- Give me a name.
- Yurinov.

922
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:07,470
Boris.

923
01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:09,550
- Boris The Blade?
- Yeah.

924
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:12,680
As in Boris The Bullet-Dodger?

925
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:16,640
Why do they call him
The Bullet-Dodger?

926
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,980
Because he dodges bullets, Avi.

927
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:24,860
He won't fight unless
we buy his mum a caravan...

928
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:26,700
...and you nicked all our savings.

929
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:31,200
In the quiet words
of the Virgin Mary, come again?

930
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:36,040
He's a stubborn bastard. He said
he's got to look after his mum.

931
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:38,620
- Are you taking the piss?
- What can I do?

932
01:02:38,830 --> 01:02:41,040
I can't make him do it, can I?

933
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:44,420
You're not much good to me alive
are you, Turkish?

934
01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:53,470
He's a useless shite, that boy.
Punish him for me, Errol.

935
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:57,060
I want that pikey to fight.

936
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:24,750
Brick Top thought smashing up
our arcade...

937
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,050
...might help me
to persuade Mickey to fight.

938
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:31,010
And if that wasn't enough...

939
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:34,180
...he thought it would be
a good idea...

940
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:36,930
...to burn Mickey's mum's caravan.

941
01:03:38,350 --> 01:03:40,140
While she was asleep in it.

942
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:39,450
Turkish, get your arse up.

943
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
You lot...

944
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:44,210
...follow me
and I'll fucking shoot you.

945
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:48,130
Calm down, son. Behave yourself.

946
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:52,340
I've got the gun, son.
I think it's you who should behave.

947
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:54,050
What?

948
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:57,180
You want to see
if I've got the minerals?

949
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:17,120
Jesus.

950
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,950
Sorry, Mickey.

951
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:21,660
Did you do it?

952
01:05:26,670 --> 01:05:28,250
Then what are you sorry for?

953
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,960
- What are you two doing here?
- Come back!

954
01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:35,050
- You got some tars on you.
- Fuck off, Darren.

955
01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:37,340
Fuck off!

956
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:46,440
How silly do I feel?

957
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:49,650
His mum is still smoking
next to us...

958
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:51,940
...and I'm asking him to fight.

959
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:56,030
I'll do the fight before he causes
any more carnage.

960
01:05:56,570 --> 01:05:58,370
And if he'd said no...

961
01:05:58,530 --> 01:06:00,950
...it could've been
a shite sight worse.

962
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:15,420
Russians.

963
01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:17,130
I should've known.

964
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:21,260
Anti-Semite, slippery Cossack sluts.

965
01:06:21,470 --> 01:06:23,560
What do you know about this goyim?

966
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:25,810
Ex-KGB cancer.

967
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,770
He was a highly trained
undercover agent.

968
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:31,230
He'll be impossible to track down.

969
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:33,270
Yeah.

970
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:36,900
There's a strange man who wants
to sell us an 84-carat stone.

971
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:39,660
- Where's he from?
- I don't know. Hard to tell.

972
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:41,450
He's got a thick Russian accent.

973
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:58,470
Well, what was I supposed to do?
He set the dogs on me. Look.

974
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:02,220
That sneaky Russian!
No wonder he didn't want to do it.

975
01:07:02,430 --> 01:07:05,350
First things first. One of us...

976
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:10,480
...Tyrone, you go to the Russian's.
The second you see him, call us.

977
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:12,150
Now.

978
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:21,280
He's a right handful,
this fella, so watch out.

979
01:07:21,490 --> 01:07:24,990
I hate Russians.
I'll take care of him.

980
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:26,870
All yours, Rosebud, old son.

981
01:07:27,870 --> 01:07:29,710
Not a problem.

982
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:33,170
Get me to a doctor.

983
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:36,210
Shoot that fuck!
Then, get me to a doctor.

984
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:38,380
Okay, but first we get the stone.

985
01:07:38,630 --> 01:07:40,800
First the stone. Then a doctor.

986
01:07:41,010 --> 01:07:43,890
And not just any doctor, boychik.
A nice Jewish doctor.

987
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:46,220
Find my friend a nice Jewish doctor!

988
01:07:50,350 --> 01:07:52,980
Get his keys
and find out where the stone is.

989
01:07:53,230 --> 01:07:57,650
- I think you got something to tell us.
- Take it easy, Rosebud.

990
01:07:57,860 --> 01:08:00,150
Do you want him to be able
to talk or not?

991
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:02,780
What the fuck do you mean, replicas?

992
01:08:02,990 --> 01:08:06,660
They look the shit, don't they?
And nobody is going to argue.

993
01:08:06,870 --> 01:08:09,540
I've got extra loud blanks,
just in case.

994
01:08:10,290 --> 01:08:13,420
In case we have
to deafen them to death?

995
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:21,170
- Yeah.
- Boris is here.

996
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:24,510
- We're coming over. Hold him there.
- Hold on!

997
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:25,850
He's not on his own!

998
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:33,310
We're off.

999
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:40,440
Very industrious for a Cossack.

1000
01:08:48,870 --> 01:08:51,500
Sneaky fucking Russian.

1001
01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:56,210
So, where is he?

1002
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:59,130
It's not just he.
Three fellas went in the house.

1003
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:02,340
- They locked Boris in the car.
- Why didn't you tell us that?

1004
01:09:03,970 --> 01:09:05,140
Did they look hard?

1005
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:06,640
They looked messy.

1006
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:09,640
- Let's get out of here.
- What about the Russian?

1007
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:11,720
I want you to bury him.

1008
01:09:12,270 --> 01:09:13,310
All right.

1009
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:17,230
I think we should get you a new gun.

1010
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:19,150
But this time, try it.

1011
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:21,610
How far to the Russian's?

1012
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:23,400
Be there in a minute.

1013
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:31,790
- Come on, then.
- No, no, not so fast, Vinny.

1014
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,000
We can't take them now.
We're going to have to follow them.

1015
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:39,130
You shouldn't drink
that stuff, anyway.

1016
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:40,960
Why? What's wrong with it?

1017
01:09:41,170 --> 01:09:44,130
- It's not in sync with evolution.
- Shut up.

1018
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:45,760
How do we get rid of him?

1019
01:09:45,970 --> 01:09:48,430
- Do you want to shoot him?
- It's a little noisy.

1020
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,680
- Do you want to stab him?
- That's a little cold-blooded.

1021
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:55,350
- Do you want to kill him or not?
- I'll cut him. I got a blade.

1022
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:56,980
That's the spirit.

1023
01:09:57,190 --> 01:09:58,690
Do they fire?

1024
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:00,190
Of course they fire.

1025
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:02,610
But how do you know?
They're replicas.

1026
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:04,780
What do you know about replicas?

1027
01:10:09,070 --> 01:10:11,080
What the fuck are you doing, Solomon?

1028
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:13,490
You wanted to know
whether they worked.

1029
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:18,630
I didn't mean try it in the car,
Sol, you arsehole!

1030
01:10:18,790 --> 01:10:21,380
What are you going to do with that,
pick his teeth?

1031
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:25,300
Wipe the butter off and put it away.
There's a proper blade back there.

1032
01:10:25,470 --> 01:10:28,890
Cows have only been domesticated
in the last 8000 years.

1033
01:10:29,090 --> 01:10:31,600
Before, they were running
around mad as lorries.

1034
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:35,770
The human digestive system hasn't
got used to any dairy products yet.

1035
01:10:35,980 --> 01:10:39,060
Well, fuck me, Tommy.
What have you been reading?

1036
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:41,190
Let me do you a favour.

1037
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:47,320
Whoops.

1038
01:10:47,490 --> 01:10:48,990
You. Want a knife?

1039
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:51,370
No, not me.
I wouldn't know what to do.

1040
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:53,790
It's a knife, for God's sake.

1041
01:10:53,990 --> 01:10:56,080
What's kept your fork company
all these years?

1042
01:10:56,290 --> 01:10:59,870
The sharp side, a blunt side.
What do you want, a lesson?

1043
01:11:22,230 --> 01:11:23,400
Is that Boris?

1044
01:11:41,210 --> 01:11:43,960
Oh, Tyrone, what have you done?

1045
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:46,800
What about Rosebud?

1046
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:49,800
Well, you can bring him
with you if you like.

1047
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:52,640
But which bit would you like?

1048
01:11:57,140 --> 01:11:58,220
They're getting out.

1049
01:11:59,270 --> 01:12:01,440
Get down and follow them.

1050
01:12:01,690 --> 01:12:03,690
Cover yourself up, Avi.

1051
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:05,270
You're making a scene.

1052
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:08,110
I'm sorry for causing a scene, Tony.

1053
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:11,450
Whoa, you are not taking
that dog with you, Vince.

1054
01:12:11,610 --> 01:12:13,320
I can't leave him in here, can I?

1055
01:12:20,410 --> 01:12:22,420
Pint of the black stuff, landlord.

1056
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:27,960
I thought you wanted to get
cleaned up. Bathroom's back there.

1057
01:12:28,170 --> 01:12:31,920
- He's left the door open.
- Shouldn't think that's a good idea.

1058
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:33,590
Should we go in?

1059
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:37,260
I don't want to go in there.
He's a dangerous bastard.

1060
01:12:37,510 --> 01:12:41,560
Taken too many disco biscuits
in the heat of Russian disputations.

1061
01:12:41,810 --> 01:12:45,270
He's got as many of these nuts
as he has those nuts.

1062
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:48,440
I don't care if
he's got fucking hazelnuts.

1063
01:12:48,650 --> 01:12:52,400
I want a gun that works,
and I'm going to tell him.

1064
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:56,660
My God, Tommy, you certainly
got those minerals.

1065
01:12:56,950 --> 01:13:00,620
Well, come on then,
before "zee" Germans get here.

1066
01:13:00,830 --> 01:13:03,120
You just tell him who's in charge.

1067
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:10,340
Boris...

1068
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:16,840
You certainly told him.

1069
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:25,900
The Drowning Trout.

1070
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:30,650
Come and pick us up. And Doug...

1071
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:33,400
...sharpish.

1072
01:13:53,590 --> 01:13:56,470
I don't want a fuss or to put
a bullet in your face...

1073
01:13:56,720 --> 01:14:00,350
...but unless you give me what
I want, there will be fucking murders.

1074
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:04,100
What's your name?

1075
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:05,980
Shoot him.

1076
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:17,030
Let go of the gun!

1077
01:14:22,870 --> 01:14:26,290
So, you're obviously the big dick...

1078
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:29,920
...and that, on either side of you,
are your balls.

1079
01:14:30,790 --> 01:14:33,050
There are two types of balls:

1080
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:37,760
There are big brave balls,
and there are little faggot balls.

1081
01:14:37,970 --> 01:14:40,470
These are your last words
so make them a prayer.

1082
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:43,310
Dicks have drive
and clarity of vision...

1083
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,060
...but they're not clever.

1084
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:49,650
They smell pussy and they want
a piece of the action.

1085
01:14:50,610 --> 01:14:53,820
And you thought you smelled
some good old pussy...

1086
01:14:54,110 --> 01:14:57,320
...and have brought your
two little faggot balls along...

1087
01:14:57,570 --> 01:15:01,070
...for a good old time. But
you've got your parties muddled up.

1088
01:15:02,740 --> 01:15:04,410
There's no pussy here...

1089
01:15:05,330 --> 01:15:08,830
...just a dose that'll make you wish
you were born a woman.

1090
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:11,250
Like a prick...

1091
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:13,790
...you're having second thoughts.

1092
01:15:14,590 --> 01:15:16,670
You're shrinking.

1093
01:15:17,510 --> 01:15:20,220
And your two little balls
are shrinking with you.

1094
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:24,810
The fact that you've got "Replica"
written on the side of your gun...

1095
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:34,520
...and the fact that
I've got "Desert Eagle.50"...

1096
01:15:37,190 --> 01:15:38,990
...written on the side of mine...

1097
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:45,660
...should precipitate...

1098
01:15:46,830 --> 01:15:50,670
...your balls into shrinking,
along with your presence.

1099
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:54,040
Now...

1100
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:58,210
...fuck off.

1101
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:15,060
Lock the door.

1102
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:16,650
Lock it!

1103
01:16:22,530 --> 01:16:23,820
Give me the case.

1104
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:26,200
Fuck you.

1105
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:28,200
Shoot me.

1106
01:16:28,410 --> 01:16:30,660
I will. I'll shoot you.

1107
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:43,760
Pass me case or I shoot you.

1108
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:46,220
You know what?

1109
01:16:46,430 --> 01:16:47,560
Fuck you too.

1110
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:51,430
Go ahead and shoot me. You'd be
doing me a favour, you Russian fuck.

1111
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:54,400
You! Drop guns.

1112
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:55,940
Fuck you!

1113
01:16:56,110 --> 01:16:58,150
You drop your gun!

1114
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:00,780
Okay.

1115
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:02,860
Avi...

1116
01:17:03,030 --> 01:17:04,200
...pull your socks up!

1117
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:21,010
- Tyrone?
- Fuck it. We're out of here.

1118
01:17:22,130 --> 01:17:23,720
Give me case.

1119
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:37,650
Avi...

1120
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:40,900
...where's the case?
- Put the gun away.

1121
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:44,150
What's Boris doing here?

1122
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:47,240
Boris, what are you doing here?

1123
01:17:47,450 --> 01:17:49,450
Fuck you!

1124
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:59,460
Where's the case?

1125
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:03,510
- You piece of crap.
- Don't take the piss, Boris.

1126
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:05,930
I'll show you.

1127
01:18:09,470 --> 01:18:11,060
Fuck you!

1128
01:18:14,770 --> 01:18:16,890
Almost had it.

1129
01:18:17,190 --> 01:18:18,940
For fuck's sake.

1130
01:18:23,530 --> 01:18:25,190
Fuck you and all.

1131
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:29,530
You lucky bastard.

1132
01:18:35,370 --> 01:18:37,790
Jeez, it's flawless.

1133
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:41,250
Don't get attached to it.
It's going to Brick Top.

1134
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:42,710
Leave the dog here.

1135
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:47,800
- Sol, why don't we just leave?
- Because life's too short, Vincent...

1136
01:18:48,050 --> 01:18:50,890
...and it'll get a lot shorter
if Brick Top wishes.

1137
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:54,390
- Now leave that dog here.
- I'm going to leave the dog here.

1138
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:55,730
Don't worry about it!

1139
01:18:55,890 --> 01:18:59,600
And if that pikey mutt does
any damage, you're going to pay.

1140
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:02,480
It's okay.

1141
01:19:03,230 --> 01:19:05,070
Sit down. Down.

1142
01:19:10,070 --> 01:19:13,120
I don't want to go in there.
You'll never see me again.

1143
01:19:13,370 --> 01:19:15,620
Well, we won't if you don't.

1144
01:19:16,410 --> 01:19:18,460
All right, you give me the stone...

1145
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:22,590
...and I will give it
to Brick Top. Yeah?

1146
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:26,960
All right. Give me a minute.
It's a bit fiddly.

1147
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,090
Why is it down there?

1148
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:36,060
Well, I put it down there
in case we got mugged.

1149
01:19:36,430 --> 01:19:38,180
You isn't from this planet, are you?

1150
01:19:38,350 --> 01:19:42,270
Who is going to mug two black fellas
holding pistols...

1151
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:46,280
...sat in a car that's worth less
than your shirt?

1152
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:52,910
Bullet-Tooth Tony and his friend,
Desert Eagle.50.

1153
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:55,620
What have they got to do
with anything?

1154
01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:58,120
They're both staring straight at me.

1155
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:05,460
You should never underestimate
the predictability of stupidity.

1156
01:20:05,630 --> 01:20:06,960
Now, out of the car.

1157
01:20:07,130 --> 01:20:09,470
And leave your water pistols behind.

1158
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:14,010
Look, just tell him the stone's back
at the office.

1159
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:15,810
I'll think of something.

1160
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:21,730
Why's he sweating?

1161
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:24,980
Oh, never mind.

1162
01:20:25,190 --> 01:20:27,940
Tommy, why is your skin leaking?

1163
01:20:28,110 --> 01:20:32,280
- I'm a little worried, actually.
- Worried about what?

1164
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:36,700
What happens if the gypsy knocks
the other man out?

1165
01:20:36,950 --> 01:20:38,990
I mean, he's done it before,
hasn't he?

1166
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:43,290
We get murdered before we leave the
building, and we get fed to the pigs.

1167
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:47,960
I'm glad to see you're climbing
the walls in fucking anxiety.

1168
01:20:49,670 --> 01:20:53,800
Pardon my cynicism,
but I don't exactly trust the pikey.

1169
01:20:54,050 --> 01:20:56,300
Don't think I haven't thunk
about that one.

1170
01:20:56,510 --> 01:21:00,180
It's his mum's funeral tonight.
God bless her.

1171
01:21:02,850 --> 01:21:05,860
You know those gypsies
like a drink at a wake.

1172
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:09,530
I'm not worried about whether Mickey
knocks the other man out.

1173
01:21:09,690 --> 01:21:12,860
I'm worried about whether he makes it
to the fourth round.

1174
01:21:13,030 --> 01:21:15,820
What if he doesn't make it
to the fourth round?

1175
01:21:16,030 --> 01:21:18,280
We get murdered before leaving
the building...

1176
01:21:18,490 --> 01:21:21,700
...and I imagine we get fed
to the pigs.

1177
01:21:23,870 --> 01:21:25,880
So why are you so calm?

1178
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:29,210
- I said...
- I heard what you said, Tommy!

1179
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:32,670
It's not as though we've got a choice,
now, is it?

1180
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:35,840
You show me how to control
a wild fucking gypsy...

1181
01:21:36,090 --> 01:21:40,560
...and I'll show you how to control
an unhinged, pig-feeding gangster.

1182
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:44,390
Bollocks! I'm going for a walk.

1183
01:22:24,270 --> 01:22:25,940
Oh, that fucking dog!

1184
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:28,900
Go on, get the dog.

1185
01:22:29,770 --> 01:22:33,070
- It's a bit funky in here, isn't it?
- Open a window.

1186
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:43,490
You people live like animals.

1187
01:22:43,950 --> 01:22:45,660
Now, where's the stone?

1188
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:48,120
- Come on, where is it?
- It's over here.

1189
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:51,460
- Where? Where?
- I left it in a box.

1190
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:57,800
It's empty.

1191
01:22:57,970 --> 01:23:01,100
I'm getting heartburn.
Tony, do something terrible.

1192
01:23:01,970 --> 01:23:04,140
No, I'm being serious!

1193
01:23:04,310 --> 01:23:06,980
The dog. The dog must have ate it.

1194
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:13,980
Now then, let's have a look,
shall we? Tony.

1195
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:17,990
- What?
- Look in the dog.

1196
01:23:19,450 --> 01:23:22,410
- You mean, "look in the dog"?
- I mean, open him up.

1197
01:23:26,660 --> 01:23:30,000
It's not a tin of baked beans.
What do you mean, open him up?

1198
01:23:30,170 --> 01:23:32,210
You know what I mean.

1199
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:35,840
That's a bit strong.

1200
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:38,920
I don't know about this.

1201
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:42,140
No, you can't do this.

1202
01:23:44,810 --> 01:23:46,310
It's fucking squeaking!

1203
01:23:46,470 --> 01:23:50,560
You never heard a dog squeak before?
Give me that goddamn gun!

1204
01:23:53,150 --> 01:23:54,820
I'm shooting the dog!

1205
01:24:03,070 --> 01:24:04,830
Shoot the fucking dog!

1206
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:18,340
You sneaky fucking bastard.

1207
01:24:30,270 --> 01:24:31,350
Thank God for that.

1208
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:45,070
I hate fucking dogs!
Come on, Tony.

1209
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:49,750
Tony, come on!

1210
01:24:58,050 --> 01:24:59,300
Tony?

1211
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:14,390
- Anything to declare?
- Yeah. Don't go to England.

1212
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:20,820
That dog is going to go back
to the campsite. It always does.

1213
01:25:21,110 --> 01:25:23,240
How's the dog
going to find the campsite?

1214
01:25:23,450 --> 01:25:25,530
Have you smelled the campsite, Sol?

1215
01:25:25,740 --> 01:25:28,910
All right. But we have
to wait until it gets light.

1216
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:31,080
And we have to get rid
of these bodies.

1217
01:25:31,290 --> 01:25:34,620
That one with the tea cosy
on his head's starting to stink.

1218
01:25:34,830 --> 01:25:40,000
Right. Let's stick them in the car,
and then go and look for a pig farm.

1219
01:25:43,170 --> 01:25:44,510
Mickey.

1220
01:25:46,590 --> 01:25:47,760
Mickey!

1221
01:25:50,430 --> 01:25:52,270
You feeling all right, Mickey?

1222
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:56,270
Need a drink.

1223
01:25:58,940 --> 01:26:00,360
You can't give him a drink!

1224
01:26:00,650 --> 01:26:02,650
It's not for him. It's for me.

1225
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:10,280
Ah, mates. Amen.

1226
01:26:17,170 --> 01:26:21,710
He's a hard bastard, this Good Night
Anderson, so pay attention.

1227
01:26:22,670 --> 01:26:24,050
All right, Mickey?

1228
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:26,180
Mickey!

1229
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:32,470
Need to have a shite!

1230
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:38,020
If you see the pikey, Turkish or
his girlfriend come out before me...

1231
01:26:38,190 --> 01:26:40,690
...shoot the bastards.

1232
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:45,490
Well, come on.
We got a fight to go to.

1233
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:53,990
All right, Tom.

1234
01:26:54,620 --> 01:26:58,620
- Hope we get a better show this time.
- This will make up for it.

1235
01:26:58,830 --> 01:27:01,540
Mickey's going down in the fourth.

1236
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:04,340
Terry over there is in charge
of the bets.

1237
01:27:04,590 --> 01:27:06,130
Now, you have to forgive me.

1238
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:09,090
I'll forgive you
if he goes down this time.

1239
01:27:12,350 --> 01:27:15,350
- Our lads at the campsite?
- They're over there now.

1240
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:20,900
I fucking hate pikeys.

1241
01:27:22,690 --> 01:27:26,740
- How long have we got to stay here?
- As long as it takes. Now, shut up.

1242
01:27:27,780 --> 01:27:29,780
Fucking hate pikeys.

1243
01:27:30,910 --> 01:27:32,910
Is he fucking stoned?

1244
01:27:33,410 --> 01:27:35,410
He's like that before a fight.

1245
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:38,080
Do you know
when you're going down?

1246
01:27:38,250 --> 01:27:40,870
Of course he knows
when he's going down.

1247
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:45,380
Fuck-face, who's speaking to you?
He asked him, didn't he?

1248
01:27:45,590 --> 01:27:48,220
Fuck-face? I like that one, Errol.

1249
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:50,880
I'll remember that next time
I climb off your mum.

1250
01:27:51,090 --> 01:27:54,430
- Not now.
- Going to be a tragedy of a fight.

1251
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:57,560
Be a nice one.
Hell of a way to war.

1252
01:27:57,770 --> 01:27:59,270
And they're none of yours.

1253
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:04,440
There's a camp full of pikeys
that might not think you're so funny.

1254
01:28:04,650 --> 01:28:08,070
Not when they're putting out flames
on their children's backs.

1255
01:28:09,490 --> 01:28:11,450
Now get up and have a fucking fight.

1256
01:28:17,450 --> 01:28:20,960
Three rounds and you're a vegetable,
aren't you, pikey!

1257
01:29:11,380 --> 01:29:14,510
I'm in charge here.
No fucking about, no eye-gouging.

1258
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:16,890
Do your worst. Let's get it on!

1259
01:29:48,380 --> 01:29:51,420
What the fuck's going on?
You going to finish him or what?

1260
01:30:33,420 --> 01:30:35,420
Talk about saved by the bell.

1261
01:30:35,970 --> 01:30:39,510
Do you understand the consequences
of knocking that man out?

1262
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:42,010
Do not knock him out, Mickey.

1263
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:50,360
All right, let's break it up.

1264
01:31:24,350 --> 01:31:25,810
What, is he fucking deaf?

1265
01:31:27,230 --> 01:31:29,020
What is he doing?

1266
01:31:44,790 --> 01:31:46,160
Come on and sit.

1267
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,920
What the fuck are you doing, Mickey?

1268
01:31:51,130 --> 01:31:53,250
You're dancing like a fairy.

1269
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:56,170
They'll hang us
if they think it's rigged.

1270
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:59,090
Get out there and hurt him.

1271
01:32:00,470 --> 01:32:05,390
But for fuck's sake,
do not knock him out.

1272
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:28,600
All he's got to do is stay down.

1273
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:35,350
Now, we are fucked.

1274
01:33:43,610 --> 01:33:44,610
He can't stand up.

1275
01:33:44,820 --> 01:33:45,820
We're out of here.

1276
01:33:45,990 --> 01:33:51,040
Stupid pikey knows Brick Top's got
keen-to-kill monkeys with shotguns...

1277
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:53,460
...sitting outside his campsite.

1278
01:33:53,660 --> 01:33:58,920
Once the campsite's wiped out,
I know it's going to be the same for us.

1279
01:34:01,460 --> 01:34:03,420
Ever cross the road
and look the wrong way?

1280
01:34:03,630 --> 01:34:05,090
Give me that fucking shooter!

1281
01:34:05,300 --> 01:34:07,840
And, hey, presto,
there's a car nearly on you.

1282
01:34:08,050 --> 01:34:09,220
So, what do you do?

1283
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:11,890
Something very silly.

1284
01:34:12,270 --> 01:34:15,140
You freeze. And your life
doesn't flash before you...

1285
01:34:15,390 --> 01:34:17,980
...because you're too scared
to think.

1286
01:34:18,150 --> 01:34:21,320
You just freeze
and pull a stupid face.

1287
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:23,780
But the pikey didn't. Why?

1288
01:34:23,990 --> 01:34:26,820
Because he had plans
on running the car over.

1289
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:31,330
It had previously occurred to me...

1290
01:34:31,620 --> 01:34:34,540
...that he'd taken the demise
of his mother rather lightly.

1291
01:34:38,290 --> 01:34:41,090
For every action,
there is a reaction.

1292
01:34:41,670 --> 01:34:43,210
And a pikey reaction...

1293
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:45,260
...is quite a fucking thing.

1294
01:35:27,260 --> 01:35:29,340
Pete, talk to me.

1295
01:35:29,550 --> 01:35:33,180
If you want your friend to hear you,
talk a lot louder than that.

1296
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:45,730
- Give me that fucking shooter.
- I'll give you your shooter, you cunt.

1297
01:35:53,700 --> 01:35:57,410
That is when I thought the pikey
had money riding on himself.

1298
01:35:58,410 --> 01:36:01,920
That's why the bastard never
goes down when he's supposed to.

1299
01:36:03,710 --> 01:36:05,420
We've been tucked up...

1300
01:36:07,090 --> 01:36:08,760
...while he's been cleaning up.

1301
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:13,430
We're worse off now than
when we started.

1302
01:36:18,930 --> 01:36:21,440
The next day we went
to the campsite...

1303
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:24,770
...but the gypsies had disappeared
during the night.

1304
01:36:24,980 --> 01:36:26,980
Which was probably a good thing...

1305
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:31,490
...considering they'd just buried
12 people somewhere in the area.

1306
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:33,320
Where is he?

1307
01:36:33,530 --> 01:36:35,780
He isn't fucking here,
that's for sure.

1308
01:36:36,490 --> 01:36:40,040
We can't ask a man to fight for us
if we can't find him, can we?

1309
01:36:40,250 --> 01:36:43,580
You won't find a pikey that
doesn't want to be found.

1310
01:36:45,460 --> 01:36:48,710
He could be in a campsite
in Kampu-fucking-chea by now.

1311
01:36:50,300 --> 01:36:52,130
Bollocks! Come on.

1312
01:36:57,390 --> 01:37:00,560
- What you doing here?
- What's it got to do with you?

1313
01:37:04,060 --> 01:37:06,230
So, what you doing here?

1314
01:37:13,820 --> 01:37:17,080
I'm taking the dog for a walk.
What's the problem?

1315
01:37:18,620 --> 01:37:19,660
What's in the car?

1316
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:21,790
Seats and a steering wheel.

1317
01:37:22,620 --> 01:37:24,460
What do you know about gypsies?

1318
01:37:26,210 --> 01:37:28,210
I know they're not to be trusted.

1319
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:33,010
All right, get your dog. On your way.

1320
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:35,340
Get the dog, Tommy.

1321
01:37:37,430 --> 01:37:38,720
The dog.

1322
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:44,560
All right, boy. Come on.
Come on, Daisy. No, Daisy!

1323
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:47,360
He loves that dog.

1324
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:49,360
Always playing silly games.

1325
01:37:49,530 --> 01:37:53,030
Stop messing about
and get it in the car. Tommy!

1326
01:37:55,610 --> 01:37:59,580
Good boy. Good boy.
Good boy, Daisy, good boy.

1327
01:38:10,380 --> 01:38:11,880
Could you tell me...

1328
01:38:12,050 --> 01:38:15,380
...why you got a dead man
with an arm missing in your boot?

1329
01:38:16,050 --> 01:38:17,050
Hey, George...

1330
01:38:18,390 --> 01:38:20,600
...is that a tea cosy on his head?

1331
01:38:23,980 --> 01:38:26,480
Oh, you love a dog, don't you, Tommy?

1332
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:38,910
Tommy persuaded me
to keep the dog.

1333
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:42,410
I eventually agreed,
as long as he took it to a vet.

1334
01:38:42,580 --> 01:38:45,500
I couldn't stand
that squeaking anymore.

1335
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:49,170
The vet found half an undigested
shoe, a squeaky toy...

1336
01:38:49,420 --> 01:38:52,750
...and an 84-carat diamond
lodged in its stomach.

1337
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:55,800
It's quite amazing what can happen
in a week.

1338
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:58,180
Still didn't shut it up, though.

1339
01:38:59,090 --> 01:39:00,760
So, what do you do?

1340
01:39:00,930 --> 01:39:04,060
You go see the man that knows
about these sort of things.

1341
01:39:04,270 --> 01:39:05,930
So, what do you think?

1342
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:09,850
Do you know anyone
who'd be interested?

1343
01:39:14,650 --> 01:39:15,650
I might.
