1
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:08,969
in memory of...

2
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,812
...my grandfather, Nazmi Erdoan

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,572
and my brother, Grdal Tosun...

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,452
1974 - A small town
in southeastern Turkey

5
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,133
Emin! Emin!

6
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,129
Yeah, what?

7
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,650
Cut it out!

8
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,212
lso, Veysi, you bastards.

9
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,288
Just wait till l catch you!

10
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,694
Stop it!

11
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,729
lf l fucking catch you...!

12
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,372
Sons of bitches!
l'll show you!

13
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,295
Damn!

14
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,014
Missed it again!

15
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,532
lsn't it a bit too close for comfort?

16
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,135
Closeness inspires love,
which leads to Art.

17
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,212
How many girls have you
tried that line on?

18
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,052
Search for the answer
in my eyes.

19
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,014
-What a fucking stupid movie!
-Don't flip out on me!

20
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,735
-lt's bullshit!
-So don't watch it, idiot!

21
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,812
How am l supposed to know it's
bullshit without watching it? ldiot!

22
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,328
Keep it down!

23
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,332
Shut your faces and sit down!

24
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,617
Hello! What a coincidence!

25
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,294
You again.

26
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,974
Well, it's a public beach after all!

27
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,009
l'll tell that lady you stole her car.

28
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:09,295
That's enough out of you!
Go find yourself another beach!

29
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,170
You've utterly ruined me!

30
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,092
What's the big deal?

31
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,332
Don't cry mother.

32
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,817
l'll do my duty and come back.

33
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,214
The movie made me cry.

34
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,495
What's the matter?

35
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,656
Nothing, just hiccups.

36
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,852
Mother, please don't cry.

37
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,339
l've just been called up, that's all.

38
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:41,015
Mother, we all did it.
And l served 28 months.

39
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,698
Why so long?

40
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,019
Never mind.
lt's a bit complicated.

41
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,171
Weren't you caught with a woman?

42
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,496
Some broad?

43
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,973
That's no way to talk about
a married woman.

44
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:55,337
She was married, too?
-Why'd you say she was married?

45
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,893
l didn't. You did!

46
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,375
Cut it out.
Watch the movie! You too.

47
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,449
Mother!

48
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,413
l told you, it's the movie.

49
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,456
What's there to cry about?

50
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:16,893
They won't live happily ever after.

51
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,654
lt's all over,
and we're together again.

52
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,850
Till death do us part.

53
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,051
lt's these false teeth, Mayor.

54
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,171
Food keeps getting stuck
under them.

55
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,330
You've gotten old, Casim.

56
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,856
We'll be eating helva next year
after your funeral service.

57
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,492
Why me?
Maybe you'll die pimp.

58
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,378
l still have my own teeth, codger!

59
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,529
Pimp!

60
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,937
But there's only a couple of months
between you.

61
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,776
No way! Old Casim was friends
with my late uncle.

62
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,820
Fuck off!
He's been dead for ten years!

63
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,937
See? You've got one foot
in the grave!

64
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,217
You're like a fossil, Casim.

65
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,895
We'll put you in the museum
if we get one.

66
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:55,975
No hard feelings. l was just
joking along with the others.

67
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,130
Rifat.

68
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,015
lf you've finished eating,
go say goodbye to your friends.

69
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,210
Yes, sir.

70
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,809
Stay away
from their mothers, though.

71
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,128
Don't worry, dad.

72
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,417
So, Rifat's doing his
military service too.

73
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:18,612
Time sure flies. l was a private in
lzmir and...

74
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,773
...there was this officer who...

75
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,849
Well, dear old Casim.

76
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,175
lzmir was part of the Ottoman
Empire then, wasn't it?

77
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,375
Empire?

78
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,258
Turkey wasn't even
a republic back then!

79
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,536
Asiye!

80
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,859
Hey, Asiye!

81
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,529
Rifat. What are you doing?

82
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,377
Shhh.

83
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,298
Mother's photo!

84
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,729
Go! Quick!

85
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,693
l'm going away.

86
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,774
l'm going away.

87
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,535
l know.

88
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,736
You'll wait for me, won't you?

89
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,649
l'll wait.

90
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,410
What should l get you from Ankara?

91
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,455
What do you know about gifts?
Some men even write poetry.

92
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,178
All you do is chase after a ball.

93
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,809
l don't chase after a ball. l'll be
a football player one day. God willing.

94
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,050
Don't start that again.

95
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,335
What's that?

96
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,579
My scab's inside it.

97
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,298
Scab?

98
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,297
Remember how l fell and skinned
my knee when we first met?

99
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,818
l saved the scab
because it was our wound.

100
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,378
l know it's silly, but...

101
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,818
l thought it'd be better than
giving you a picture.

102
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,379
You might get bored of it.

103
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:37,215
But a scab
is like a piece of my flesh.

104
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,134
lt'll give you a pang
every time you look at it.

105
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,818
ls heart-of-stone Asiye crying?

106
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,175
Why would l cry?

107
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:50,174
l thing a scab's a silly gift
for a girlfriend, too.

108
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,969
Mom's probably looking for me.

109
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,255
-l'll write the minute l get there.
-Fine.

110
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,177
-What do you mean, fine?
-You know. Fine.

111
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,175
Give me a kiss.

112
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,578
You know, l'm off to the army.

113
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,729
Not like that.
On the lips, like in the movies.

114
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,849
No way.

115
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,339
l won't leave until you do.

116
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,614
Don't then.

117
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,379
Don't eat the food over there.

118
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,854
l won't, mom.

119
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,014
lf she could, she wouldn't let go of
him until he was discharged.

120
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,772
Siti, the bus is leaving!

121
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,855
Don't eat just anything.
You've got a sensitive stomach.

122
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,937
Have someone else try the food
first. Then eat it.

123
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,172
All right, mom.
May God be with you.

124
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,255
Look.

125
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,934
What do you think?

126
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:23,093
That's what l got up to in Ankara.

127
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:32,372
The last time l went to the nightclub
the owner said ''Welcome, Fikri''.

128
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,937
Turns out he'd seen my name
on my lD bracelet.

129
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,700
l asked where Feri was.

130
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,330
l've got a babe there. l call her Feri
cause she looks like the actress.

131
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,537
Her real name is Gulsen,
but her friends call her Munevver.

132
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,419
And when we're alone
l call her ''lambchop''.

133
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,371
She's such a sweetie.

134
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,369
Hello, Engin.

135
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,893
Hi, Emin.

136
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,530
l brought your radio.

137
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,215
Does it work now?

138
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,932
What do you mean? Has any radio
escaped my healing hands?

139
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,773
-What kind of answer is that?
-What kind of question was that?

140
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,608
How much do l owe you?

141
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,691
Don't worry about it till later.

142
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,816
ls that scumbag there in the shop?

143
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,051
Where in Ankara is this nightclub?

144
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,098
ln Ulus. Over by that statue.

145
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,173
You should see all the lights and
glitter. Real classy joint...

146
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,698
What do you want, psycho?

147
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,730
l want my money.

148
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,376
What money?

149
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,258
Didn't l fix your radio last year?

150
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,978
And didn't you tell me
to come back later?

151
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:47,777
-Now fork it over!
-Think you can bully me, dickhead?

152
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,053
-Watch your mouth, Fikri!
-What are you talking about?

153
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,374
Get out of here, fuck-face!

154
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,736
Fikri, what do you want
from the poor orphan?

155
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,969
The bastard's cursing at me.

156
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:02,936
You started it! l fixed your radio.
Now pay up, faggot!

157
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,732
Who're you calling faggot, pimp!

158
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,936
Pimp yourself, you son of a bitch.

159
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,654
Stop it. That's enough.
Go on, get out of here, Emin.

160
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,536
Maniac...

161
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,093
See you later, Fikri.

162
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,136
Damn! My arm!

163
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:39,058
Here's a list. Wires, spools and stuff.
Make sure you don't forget anything.

164
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:45,734
This is no time for joking around.
l feel awful. l'm getting out of here.

165
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,778
''The Gangsters'', showing tonight
at the Lale Cinema.

166
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,899
Welcome, Mr. Mayor.

167
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,135
-Give me your blessings, father.
-Bless you, my son.

168
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,213
Goodbye.

169
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,171
The soldiers are leaving
on the bus.

170
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,971
Our Rifat's on it, too.

171
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,053
They've called up
all the young ones this time.

172
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,979
Why did they take so many
this time around?

173
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,570
You've got the wrong idea
about me. Really.

174
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,571
Try that number on some other girl.

175
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:32,575
When l'm in love, l feel it here.

176
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:37,575
And when l do
there are no lies, no tricks.

177
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,935
l feel it with my heart and soul.

178
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:45,092
That bastard's been showing
the same movie all week.

179
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,613
Cool!

180
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,293
l wish it was an action movie.

181
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,777
Maybe there'll be
some kissing action.

182
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,293
Shut up, you pervert.

183
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,651
That girl sleeps day and night.

184
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,457
Wake up and have some melon.

185
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:22,410
-Huh?
-Want some melon rinds?

186
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,730
No thanks, mother.

187
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,769
l adore you, l entreat you...

188
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:38,296
Are you all right? Don't cry sonny.

189
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,017
Get down you little devils!

190
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,611
Are they up on the roof again?

191
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,615
Movies make you forget everything.

192
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,539
Didn't l tell you the kids
shouldn't climb trees at night?

193
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,293
-What happened, dad?
-A lot of crap, that's what!

194
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,657
All right. l'll have some now.

195
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,369
And didn't l say no one could
watch Latif's movies?

196
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,058
We don't go there.
We watch from here.

197
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,653
You may as well have gone on in!

198
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,696
Hey, little devils, have some melon.

199
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,969
Hello.

200
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,419
Come in, Seyhmus.

201
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:14,978
l noticed you didn't get your melon
tonight, Mayor. This one's on me.

202
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,369
Thanks. They've already bought one.

203
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,773
Oh, really?

204
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,859
Keep this one for tomorrow, then.

205
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:29,690
Must have bought it from my boy.
Good night!

206
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,855
Where'd you get this?

207
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,454
Do we have to answer
for everything we do?

208
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,859
So you stole it, then?

209
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,139
ls the Mayor's family
a pack of thieves?

210
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,815
lf l stole it was for the child.

211
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,379
l'll be the laughing stock
of the town!

212
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,891
Those you look down on
are people of honor.

213
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,494
Go home! The film's over!

214
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,618
l'm leaving,
but only to return one day.

215
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,014
How's it going, lso, Veysi?
Good night.

216
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,336
You electrocuted me!
What's 'n your hand?

217
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,612
Teasing me'll get you
the shock of your life.

218
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:31,332
All that kissing
and stuff is phony.

219
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,373
Watch what l'm
gonna do to Crazy Emin.

220
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,370
Crazy Emin!

221
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,577
Cut it out, you bastard!

222
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,776
Maniac!

223
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,858
So your boy's in the army.

224
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,089
lt's no big deal.

225
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:14,655
He's so young. l wish it'd been
Ahmet, not Rifat. He's so helpless.

226
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,049
l wish they'd take Ahmet forever.

227
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,978
l wish l didn't have a son like him.

228
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,015
Rifat was my father's favorite.

229
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:26,889
He said Rifat would grow up to be
a village head like him.

230
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,377
He said ''Just like me.''

231
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:37,416
Nazmi, is Ankara so very far?

232
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:51,569
Why do you put this flowerpot here?

233
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,740
lt's right in the middle of the road.

234
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,937
Of course l'll bump into it.

235
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:01,499
ls there another way in?

236
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:15,098
Stop! l heard something.

237
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,898
Never mind. We're busy.

238
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:28,014
Slow down. Wait for me!

239
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,055
Cool!

240
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,334
Why do stars shoot?

241
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:52,529
l asked that once. lt's so crowded
up there that some fall to earth.

242
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,570
Who'd you ask?

243
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,093
A friend.

244
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,213
Why're you farting, you pansy!

245
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,934
We're outside.
What's the big deal?

246
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,529
lt stinks just as much.

247
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,573
Don't cry my boy.

248
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,375
So are you little pests
sleeping up on the roof?

249
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,619
What's so funny?

250
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,499
Don't cry, honey.

251
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,418
Gule! Nafiz!

252
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,818
Go tell your father
to get the bonesetter.

253
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,532
-The poor thing broke his foot.
-OK, mom.

254
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,937
Don't forget to
put on your underwear.

255
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,136
How did you know?

256
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,932
Come on. Get going.

257
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,579
What's all the racket about?

258
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,651
-Ylmaz broke his foot.
-Which Ylmaz?

259
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,697
Remember your son?!

260
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,815
What an idiot!

261
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,332
Get out of my way.

262
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:25,169
You'd think l broke his foot.

263
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,853
Get up, Gule
and make me breakfast!

264
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,456
Esteemed citizens...

265
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,932
...a surfeit of sand in the
municipal mains...

266
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:40,810
..may lead to certain unavoidable
obstruction of services.

267
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,811
Thank you for your
restraint and patience.

268
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,856
What's he talking about?

269
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:48,091
Water isn't running because the pipes
are filled with sand.

270
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:52,931
What would life be without
your entertaining announcements.

271
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,937
What a great mayor we have.
Water running through the streets...

272
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:02,618
...but not through the pipes.
What a great job!

273
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,210
lt's not the Mayor's fault.
lt's that bastard contractor.

274
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,379
Watch your mouth!
Fikri's my cousin.

275
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,338
Well, l'm related to the Mayor.

276
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,416
Did l call the Mayor a bastard?

277
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,730
You can't, because he isn't one.

278
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,532
And is Fikri a bastard?

279
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:23,171
lf he weren't your cousin, he'd be
the biggest bastard around.

280
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,018
Now you're talking.

281
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,734
What's so funny?

282
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:41,859
Fikri, you haven't done any work.
How can you ask for money?

283
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:47,058
We all know that contractors
occasionally get down to work.

284
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,371
You don't like the work
but you like the money.

285
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:56,210
You and your team grab all contracts,
but do nothing.

286
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,334
Mr. Mayor, those words
of yours sure sting.

287
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,697
Can words sting an ox!

288
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:07,136
What are insults to oxen?

289
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,213
Why couldn't you
lay a pipe in five years?

290
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,652
We never get advances in time.

291
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:15,618
You waste them carousing around
with women.

292
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:18,852
lf l've spent so much as a penny
on a woman, l'm no man.

293
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:21,050
We all know you're no man.

294
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:25,170
Mayor, you're addressing the
grandson of Village Head Bedri!

295
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,616
Bedri was a muledriver.

296
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:32,096
So you can't love animals
and be village head?

297
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,332
The late, great lover of mules.

298
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,976
You're wasting my time. Get out!

299
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,693
At least give me my advance.

300
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,735
Fikri!

301
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:45,172
Don't expect any work
to get done then.

302
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,616
Do you expect my team
to work for free?

303
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:51,659
Get the money back from your
women and give it to the men, then.

304
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,210
What's this obsession with women?

305
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,092
Have you been paid, Mr. Fikri?

306
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:06,932
Fat chance! When l campaign
for him, we get along.

307
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,488
When it comes to money, he
starts squirming.

308
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:16,812
When he needs me it's all praises
for my grandfather,...

309
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:20,250
...for his wonderful mules.

310
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,930
l need money, not flattery!

311
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,859
Give me a cigarette, Sezgin.

312
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:25,970
l don't have any.

313
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:26,851
Come on.

314
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,493
Let's see. Ah!

315
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:35,134
l thought l'd thrown that pack away.
Must have noticed that only...

316
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,973
one or two were left and made
plans to toss it.

317
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:41,536
That's how l forgot all about it.

318
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:45,772
lf l had tossed it,
l'd have forgotten it by now.

319
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:52,255
You'll have to wait for your kickback,
my friend Sezgin. See you.

320
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,895
Sezgin.

321
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,016
Yes, sir.

322
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,051
You're losing your hair.

323
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,408
lt's just my high forehead.

324
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,894
Mr. Good-looking, huh?

325
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,299
Mind your own business.

326
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,972
-ls my dad in?
-Yeah.

327
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,619
Anyone with him?

328
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,655
Nope.

329
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,169
Sezgin.

330
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,608
What?

331
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,974
Never mind.

332
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,330
Come on, you looked at my head!

333
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:22,293
You're thinning a bit on top.

334
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,654
Get lost.

335
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,770
Dad, Ylmaz fell off the roof.

336
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,131
What's so funny about that?

337
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:33,457
Nothing. l was just kidding around
with Sezgin, that's why.

338
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,695
How's Ylmaz?

339
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,975
Mom said he broke his foot.

340
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,813
She wants you
to get the bonesetter.

341
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,858
Okay, you can go.

342
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,694
lf you have an errand for me...

343
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,409
l wouldn't waste one on you.

344
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,133
When do you start work?

345
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,851
Next month, God willing.

346
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,933
God willing.

347
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:01,458
Mr. Basri, the town administrator,
is here to see you.

348
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,491
-Send him in.
-Yes, sir.

349
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:06,936
Sezgin, have you heard about
some new shampoo?

350
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,615
No, sir. What is it like?

351
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:13,733
You rub it on your ass and the hair
there comes out on your head.

352
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:16,778
Bit wiry, though.

353
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,975
Our Mayor's such a wit.

354
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,608
Welcome, Basri.

355
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,372
Nothing welcome about it.

356
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:31,772
We're in big trouble!

357
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,135
What happened?

358
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:38,539
When there's some state job to get
done, they pin it on me.

359
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:43,217
The governor asked me to oversee
things personally.

360
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,859
Sorry to hear that, Basri.
Anyway, let's have some tea.

361
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,775
l'm sorry too. But for you.

362
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:56,130
The Governor was so pleased to
hear you'd take charge of it.

363
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,978
Where did he hear that?

364
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,209
l told him.

365
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,860
Great. What is it exactly?

366
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:05,414
Receiving a delegation
from Ankara.

367
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,495
What delegation?

368
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:09,771
They're bringing
a vizontele transmitter.

369
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,256
A what?

370
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:17,813
You know. lt's in all the papers.

371
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:23,379
So we're finally getting one too?

372
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,496
l knew you'd be thrilled about it.

373
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,735
Good!

374
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,815
Mr. Mayor, what exactly is it?

375
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:41,172
You know, we've all heard about it.

376
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,730
Radio with pictures.

377
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:50,773
l'll give you all the help
my official capacity allows me.

378
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,538
What help? lt's your job!

379
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,852
Certainly! Assisting you is my duty!

380
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,373
Goodbye.

381
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,818
Radio with pictures.

382
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:11,972
Movies in every home.
lt will be the end of Latif.

383
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,249
Attention!

384
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:19,699
Anyone selling goods on public
property will be in big trouble!

385
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:24,258
And don't say l didn't warn you first!

386
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,532
Don't cry honey.

387
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,573
lt's dislocated, not broken.

388
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,174
So, he's all right?

389
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,457
Sure. lf he's careful today,
he'll be on his feet tomorrow.

390
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,619
Bless you. Let's bind it.

391
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:42,328
Many thanks, Saban.

392
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,779
What a great pair of glasses!

393
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,620
They were my father's.
Now they're mine.

394
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,134
-Will your kids wear them after you?
-God willing.

395
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,091
Goodbye.

396
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,216
l caught it! l caught it!

397
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,738
Well, l sliced up the bread!

398
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,055
Musto, Aykut! Let it go!

399
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,336
Let what go?

400
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:11,497
The bird, of course.
Think l'm an idiot?

401
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,338
Come weed the garden.

402
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,216
What's wrong, Sddk?

403
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:33,493
lt's my tooth, Mr. Mayor. l'll have
it pulled next month, God willing.

404
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,774
Come here. l'll wash you down.

405
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,289
ls what l heard true?

406
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,690
What did you hear?
Spit it out slowly.

407
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,890
That you're taking a second wife.

408
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:52,856
Who told you that?

409
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,249
That's not important.
ls it true?

410
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:59,010
lt's just to help you
with housework.

411
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,775
Help? There's something else
that needs help working...

412
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,652
What do you mean by that?

413
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,012
Damn! There goes another.

414
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,738
You'll ruin me!

415
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,011
Answer me, melon man.

416
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:13,654
l would, but they won't let me.

417
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,334
Take this melon home.
We'll talk it over tonight.

418
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:21,049
There's no need for that.
l got my answer!

419
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:25,008
-Look at that. A perfect melon, too.
-Don't worry. We'll eat it.

420
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:27,051
Back to work, greedy bastards.

421
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,178
l want it finished by 7:00 this
evening or there'll be...

422
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:33,969
-...a big crowd at the entrance.
-Finish it by the evening.

423
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,616
Dad, what about my, you know?

424
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,696
l'll take care of it son.
Get in the truck.

425
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,253
Get lost!

426
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:54,414
''The Gangsters'' is showing tonight!

427
00:34:54,500 --> 00:35:00,655
''The Gangsters'' tonight
at the Lale Cinema.

428
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,532
Turn it down a bit.

429
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,572
So, weeding, are you?

430
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:31,376
Yeah. Pulling up the bad plants
so the good ones can flourish.

431
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,216
Don't you have any
in your yard?

432
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,495
No.

433
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:38,378
Right. Yours are in the house.

434
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:46,417
Some weeds are tough to pull up.
They have deep roots.

435
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:50,609
So, we pull them out, roots and all.

436
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:54,252
-l heard something, is it true?
-lf you heard it, it must be false.

437
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,133
l heard vizontele is coming.

438
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,735
Oh, that.

439
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,732
Aren't you happy about it?

440
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,329
No problem. Just checking.

441
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:07,532
Do you even know what it is?

442
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,499
Sure. l saw one once in lstanbul.

443
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:13,532
Nothing like the cinema, huh.

444
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:16,459
Don't get too close.

445
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,848
We don't want any
weeds in our garden.

446
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:27,057
Let's go, Veli. We'll have a crowd
for the Ylmaz Gney movie tonight.

447
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:33,256
And keep an eye out for
the rooftop freeloaders.

448
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,577
Nothing like the cinema, huh?

449
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:45,336
lf he's so worried, this
vizontele must be a good thing.

450
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,135
Stop it. Your mother'll see us.

451
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,539
No, she won't.

452
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,695
Nafiz!

453
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,013
Coming mom.

454
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,970
-What is it?
-Make a phone call for me.

455
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:13,290
There's no point. They won't
be able to connect us.

456
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,337
Calling Ankara isn't so easy.

457
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,773
Go on. Just do it.

458
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,619
Hello, switchboard.

459
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:25,657
Hi, Salih. This is Nafiz.

460
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,290
The mayor's son.

461
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:33,493
You were going to connect us
to Ankara. What happened?

462
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,099
Hello!

463
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:38,497
We can't even get through to
the operator, let alone Ankara.

464
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:44,374
Salih! Haven't we helped you over
the years? Connect me to my Rfat!

465
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,939
Dammit!

466
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,931
lt's not Salih's fault.

467
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,529
Hello, Salih. Rifat.

468
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,058
Hello!

469
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:02,052
lt would be great with pictures.

470
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,893
-Would you like some fruit?
-What's with the fruit?

471
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,336
What are you shouting about?
Just offering.

472
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,655
Don't! l'm pissed off enough as it is.

473
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:24,849
On the road to nowhere,
heel broken, nails broken.

474
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:28,098
Hair messed up for 300 km. now!

475
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:32,373
Did l assign you?
Am l the general director?

476
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,099
lf you're not,
why are you hitting on me?

477
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,340
Hitting on you? Me?

478
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,900
lsn't he after me, Cevat?

479
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:43,372
Not exactly.
Maybe over interested is all.

480
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,178
Over interested?

481
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:48,730
Come on, you're overdoing
it a bit with the broad.

482
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:52,614
Broad? That's it!
Shut up and turn that off.

483
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,891
l swear l'm about to kill myself.

484
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,974
What kind of an assignment
is this for a lady?

485
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:02,450
That Bnyamin bastard
is responsible for all this.

486
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:06,216
l'm not about to sleep with just
any old deputy director.

487
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:09,378
We already spent 4 extra days
because the truck broke down.

488
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:12,259
By the way, l'm not staying an extra
second in this godforsaken town!

489
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,535
Aren't we going to set it up?

490
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:17,094
No way! Give them directions
and let them do it themselves.

491
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:20,491
Being exploited in a place like this!

492
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,411
Pull over. At least let me
have some water.

493
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:28,694
-What do you mean by ''at least''?
-l mean, God give me patience.

494
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,330
-Cheers.
-Same to you!

495
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,258
-We wanted some water.
-You're in the right place.

496
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,649
A fountain is the place for water.

497
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,493
ls it far to the town center?

498
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:53,329
Why are you asking? We don't
get many questions like that.

499
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,298
We're from Ankara.
We brought a television transmitter.

500
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,570
Ah? What transmitter?

501
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:03,055
Here sir. We've got something
better than water.

502
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,653
Not this early in the day.

503
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,890
We can pretend it's evening.

504
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:10,098
Tekin. What's the hold up?

505
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,419
Pass me that raki, brother.

506
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:19,010
That woman is such a bitch.
l'm about to kill her.

507
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:22,293
The guy she mentioned. Bunyamin.
The deputy director.

508
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:28,736
His wife caught them in bed. Now
she says he's under her control.

509
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,937
More like she's under him
all the time.

510
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,013
l sure feel better now.

511
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,414
Goodbye.

512
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,933
Some drinker.

513
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,534
He is. lsn't he?

514
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,176
Attention!

515
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:49,290
The delegation expected to
arive from Ankara today...

516
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:53,254
...is bringing us a
vizontele transmitter.

517
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,737
What's keeping them, Mr. Mayor?

518
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,170
They'll be here any minute, brother.

519
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:04,135
You should have made a speech.

520
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,689
What are you talking about?

521
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,419
Of course you don't have to.

522
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:10,008
You can't make a speech
every time a crowd gathers.

523
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:13,456
You'd have to speak every time
three people got together.

524
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,218
Like you've nothing better to do.

525
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:18,054
-Bring the microphone.
-Yes, sir.

526
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:37,690
This is a great day
in our town's history.

527
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:43,289
Why? Are we driving out
the enemy or something?

528
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,539
A very important delegation from...

529
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:56,852
...Ankara is bringing us a vizontele,
an example of the latest technology!

530
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,892
-What's coming?
-Vizontele.

531
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:10,058
-What's that?
-l think l saw one in Ankara.

532
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:14,219
-What does it do?
-l don't remember.

533
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:18,011
l was drunk. My eyes were
on the babe next to me.

534
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:23,898
-Sure. l believe you.
-l swear it's true! She was a singer!

535
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:27,140
What's this machine Mr. Mayor?

536
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,376
lt's like radio with pictures.

537
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,535
What do you mean?

538
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:36,770
Zeki Mren sings on the radio. Right?

539
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:37,531
Right.

540
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:42,490
With this, you can hear him and
see him at the same time!

541
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,850
Will he see us?

542
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,492
l don't know about that.

543
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:56,774
What about if you're wearing
your underwear?

544
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,295
You wouldn't want
the great Mr. Mren to see that.

545
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:07,414
And what if the prime minister
appears on the news?

546
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:10,333
Will we have to sit around
the house wearing ties?

547
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:14,089
Don't be ridiculous.
Can actors see you at the cinema?

548
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:15,616
Can't they?

549
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:24,655
No. This will be like having a cinema
in your own home. But no tickets.

550
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:31,853
There they are.

551
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,615
Welcome to our town.
l'm the Mayor, Nazmi Doan.

552
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:00,015
Go on. Get the sacrificial lamb.

553
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,812
There is no need for that.

554
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:03,493
Why? Don't you eat meat?

555
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:06,817
We can't stay long Mayor. We're
returning to Ankara immediately.

556
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,176
Now, if those gentlemen
could just unload the device...

557
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:11,376
Gentlemen! The device...

558
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:14,055
At least come up and
have a drink before dinner.

559
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:16,535
Thank you sir,
but we'll be on our way.

560
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,698
There's no getting out of here
so quickly.

561
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:22,858
lt takes at least a year to get
the right contacts...

562
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,936
...for re-assignment to Ankara.

563
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,252
What do you mean by that?

564
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:33,419
Just kidding, nothing personal.

565
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:35,778
Not my idea of a joke.

566
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:39,053
l got a bit carried away.

567
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,892
Tekin, cut the yakking!

568
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:44,450
What yakking?
She's such a maniac.

569
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:48,137
She may tired, not a maniac.
Would she care for a drink?

570
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,374
Upper Ayranc?

571
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:52,336
What?

572
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:56,089
l know Ankara very well.
Are you from Upper Ayranc?

573
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:57,734
No.

574
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,777
So it is Lower Ayranc?

575
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:00,895
No!

576
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,940
That place with a park, then?

577
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:05,619
No!

578
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,132
My name is Fikri.

579
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,295
Must be all the travelling l guess.

580
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:13,898
What were you talking to her for?

581
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:15,898
Me? She talked to me first.

582
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,614
Gave me her address in Ankara,
so l could visit her.

583
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:21,049
Let me just jot it down.

584
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:23,974
This is how you hook it up.
Understand?

585
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:27,137
Put the transmitter up
on a high hilltop.

586
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:30,855
When you get a picture,
set it there. Good luck.

587
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:35,132
Hey, wait a minute. What? How?

588
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:36,733
Move over a bit lsmihal.

589
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:38,772
So l'll be sitting on the driver's lap?

590
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:41,130
You'd think she never
sat on a lap.

591
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,654
-What was that?
-Nothing. Just a joke.

592
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:00,896
Don't blow this way.

593
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:02,573
But you're smoking too.

594
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:05,209
l want my own smoke, not yours.

595
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:10,570
-This is all your fault.
-What can l do. lt's the state's job.

596
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:14,494
We'll find a way out of this.

597
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:18,494
What do we know about this
vizontele thing? They just dumped it.

598
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:21,174
We need someone who
understands these things.

599
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:23,296
Where can we we find
someone like that?

600
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:26,290
-We've already got one.
-Who?

601
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:28,859
-Emin.
-Which Emin?

602
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:30,333
Crazy Emin, the radio guy.

603
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:36,336
Get real! You can't be serious.
We can't let that maniac near it.

604
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:43,059
He knows all about radios.
This is just one with pictures.

605
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:47,331
Do you seriously think
that nutcase can handle this?

606
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:50,494
He can build
a radio out of a shoe!

607
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:55,973
Exactly. A nutcase!
Normal people wear shoes.

608
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,577
lf anyone can do it, it's Emin.

609
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:01,812
There's no way l can help you
with that.

610
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:06,057
Just take a look, Emin.

611
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:09,690
How can l help with that?

612
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,813
And you've already got
six daughters.

613
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:15,813
But she hasn't given me a son.
Just blow on her and pray.

614
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:19,769
This holy breath thing is just
something people made up.

615
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:21,533
Your father was a holy man.

616
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:25,773
People call you crazy but l believe
you're a holy man.

617
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:28,693
You got Seyid's boy walking.

618
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,009
My father was no holy man.

619
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:34,372
God forgive you. And you
smote so and Veysi.

620
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:38,459
That was just an electric shock!

621
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:44,457
And l just made the boy a crutch.
You want one?

622
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:45,495
Would you?

623
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:50,899
Will it help me have a son?

624
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:54,419
Leave me in peace!

625
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,660
So much for neighborliness.
Come on, woman!

626
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:05,497
My father a holy man?
He was a bastard!

627
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:09,729
Back then the governor had
a daughter. Leman.

628
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:15,729
She had hair clear down to here.
And when the wind blew...

629
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,858
...she looked like a ballerina
with a long cape.

630
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:21,659
She came to the match one day.

631
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:25,331
l broke out in a sweat
even before it started.

632
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:34,091
Anyway, l caught a corner position
and headed the ball into the goal!

633
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:39,096
Everyone clapped.
l turned.

634
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:42,536
Leman was on her feet,
cheering me.

635
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:44,258
How long was she in these parts?

636
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:49,374
2 years. She told me to visit her
if l was ever in zmir.

637
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:51,576
And l did. 5 years later.

638
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:52,815
You found her?

639
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:56,171
Yeah. We had tea together.

640
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:58,895
Leman, me and her husband.

641
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:14,173
Remember what our teacher
said about this place...

642
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,853
Which teacher?

643
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,614
Our literature teacher in high school.

644
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:20,413
What'd he say?

645
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,455
He called it the capital city
of disappointment.

646
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:46,808
What is this?

647
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:50,779
lt's a vizontele.

648
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:52,979
What does it do?

649
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:55,251
lt'll bring the world to our home.

650
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:57,295
What for?

651
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:00,615
What do you mean?

652
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:05,333
-How will it do that?
-l don't know.

653
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:07,130
lt's something like a moviehouse.

654
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:10,496
-One in each home.
-May God protect us!

655
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:14,137
Mela Hseyin said
movies were sinful.

656
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:16,217
He says that about everything.

657
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:21,090
Repent. You busy yourself with this
but have no time for your son.

658
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:24,293
l haven't been able
to talk to him even once.

659
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:28,449
He's in the army. So what?
We all served. l served four years.

660
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:32,414
Nafiz! Try to call him again.

661
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:37,218
The whole world right here.

662
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:42,936
Maybe Emin really is
just the guy for this.

663
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:53,616
-Mr. Veli, when is the fight film?
-Get lost.

664
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:03,132
Wh... wh... what is it?

665
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:06,895
They all call it ''vizontele''.
But it's really called ''television''.

666
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:11,094
Wh... what is it?

667
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:18,293
lt's the devil's work. We don't show
blasphemous movies at the cinema.

668
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:22,739
But this thing will be in everyone's
house. Who knows what it'll show?

669
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:28,737
Do your religious duty.
Warn the people.

670
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:32,889
Bye!

671
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:37,929
Would you like some tea?

672
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:40,616
Ahmet!

673
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:44,091
Come to the breakfast table,
you drunk!

674
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,257
l'm here dad. What's the fuss?

675
00:51:56,260 --> 00:52:00,697
With the drinking and all,
it's become a rare honour...

676
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,139
...to see your face around here.

677
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:06,094
l drink now and then with friends,
that's all.

678
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:08,616
Now and then?

679
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:16,931
You don't even go to the office.
After all the strings l pulled.

680
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:19,092
Don't do this in front of the women!

681
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:28,448
Oh. So, you do give a damn about
the women of the house?

682
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:32,693
ls that why we married you?

683
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:36,896
Did you ask me anything
about it then?

684
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:43,533
Get up and get out! Now!

685
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:01,092
Eat your food, child.

686
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:03,819
-Nafiz.
-Yes, father.

687
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,931
Get me Emin, the radio guy.

688
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:08,491
Crazy Emin?

689
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:10,418
Go on, son!

690
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:15,897
Come on, kids...

691
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:20,097
Why are you taking them
to religious classes?

692
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:23,571
Repent, mayor. Do you want them
to grow up heathens?

693
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:35,256
Your son went, and this devilish
contraption arrived in his place.

694
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:42,935
lt's a bad omen!
You must get rid of it.

695
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:48,095
lt will bring harm on us.

696
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:57,378
God in heaven protect us!

697
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:02,294
Well, children.

698
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:10,737
Repeat after me.

699
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:57,696
All you do is eat, drink and crap.
Some of you never tumble.

700
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:01,256
Some of you think you're partridges.
You are tumblers!

701
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:04,417
Some of you get away
with two tumbles a day.

702
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:10,456
l won't name names here.

703
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:13,538
But that's finished!

704
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:16,136
No more feed for non-tumblers.

705
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:23,889
You think l will tumble for you?

706
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:27,693
No tumbles, no feed.

707
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:30,533
Go easy on the guys.
They're just birds after all.

708
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,538
What's up, good-for-nothing?

709
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:34,455
My father sent for you.

710
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:36,937
What could the teacher want?

711
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:38,495
He is the Mayor!

712
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:41,771
What ever. Mayor then. He was my
teacher once. What does he want?

713
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:48,410
Quit moping.
Have some more feed.

714
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:51,650
But l'm expecting tumbles tomorrow!

715
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:57,212
Turn that wheel a little.

716
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:58,739
This one?

717
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,330
How did you manage
to build all these gadgets.

718
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:08,258
l learned from my master.

719
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:12,892
He asked me to hold a screwdriver
for him one day.

720
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:15,210
And l never put it down again.

721
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:19,459
He didn't pay me,
but he was a great man.

722
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:22,251
Stop, get out of the way!

723
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:27,410
What's going on?
Where are you going?

724
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:33,369
Are you crazy?
Where are you going?

725
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:07,130
What are you doing?

726
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,890
Darn, missed it again!

727
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:14,057
Emin, what are you doing?

728
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:26,256
That's my mom's favorite song.
l keep running up here...

729
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:29,571
...to play it for her
on the radio,...

730
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:33,368
...but either the song is too short...

731
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,616
...or the grave's too far.

732
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:40,689
Once the song started just as l
was passing by.

733
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,499
But the battery ran out.

734
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:45,453
Then l made a battery
that never runs out.

735
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,531
A battery that never runs out?

736
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:51,292
So why does teacher want me?

737
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:52,809
-For the vizontele.
-What's that?

738
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:54,419
You haven't heard
about the new gadget?

739
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:55,455
What gadget?

740
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:57,650
You should see the look
on your face when l say gadget.

741
00:58:57,740 --> 00:58:59,093
Get to the point?
What gadget?

742
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:02,496
No one knows for sure.
Radio with pictures.

743
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:07,015
Radio with pictures!
So they finally made one?

744
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:09,330
l'd thought of it. Really.

745
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:10,889
Let's go.

746
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:13,730
That maniac's running off again!

747
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:18,374
Where is it?

748
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:21,255
Where is what?

749
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:22,694
Vizontele.

750
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:25,530
Why ask me?
Maybe the kids have it.

751
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:27,975
Don't try my patience.
l know you took it.

752
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:30,051
lt's state property.
What are you trying to do to me?

753
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:31,858
lt's the devil's property!

754
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:33,170
Says who? Mela?

755
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:35,452
That's what he says.

756
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:36,893
What did he say?

757
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:40,890
''lt's the dd... dd... dddevil's work''?

758
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:42,130
God preserve us.

759
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:43,779
Where is it?

760
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:47,576
lt will bring disaster on us.
Send it back.

761
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:52,370
My hand's about to cause
an accident.

762
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:02,170
Hi, Siti!

763
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,328
Welcome, Emin.

764
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:06,814
What's that thing on your head?

765
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:09,693
lt's for my eyes.
Where is teacher?

766
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:11,408
-Welcome, Emin.
-Thanks.

767
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:13,098
Where's the gadget?

768
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:15,649
Siti?

769
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:19,170
ln the pantry, under the oven.

770
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:21,858
Hush child!

771
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:34,976
What a beauty.
Just look at it.

772
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:40,491
l knew they'd made one one day.

773
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:44,609
So we'll set it up on a high spot?

774
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:47,372
Can you manage?

775
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:51,373
l'll have to dismantle it
and take a look.

776
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:52,376
What?

777
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:53,489
The vizontele.

778
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:56,694
What do you mean,
dismantle it?

779
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:59,500
Take off the cover and
have a look inside.

780
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:01,815
Open up a gadget like this?
Are you crazy?

781
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:03,493
Most people say so.

782
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:20,291
So... the wave hits this at right
angles. Not like the radio.

783
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:23,899
l should kiss the hand of the guy
who invented this.

784
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:26,335
Great job! They altered
the radio to...

785
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:29,059
You're driving me crazy!
Can you do it or not?

786
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:30,892
We'll put it back together,
and see.

787
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:33,137
l assume you can do that.

788
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:35,615
l suppose l can.

789
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:40,735
Suppose?
Maybe Basri was right.

790
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,616
Dad, can you step out for a minute?

791
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:49,812
-What is it?
-Look!

792
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:55,219
One meter higher
should do the trick.

793
01:01:56,940 --> 01:02:00,216
At least one more meter.

794
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:05,332
Raising the wall so we can't watch.

795
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:07,533
Shameless bastard.

796
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:13,929
Worse than shameless. You're
the mayor. Just shut it down.

797
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:18,459
l can't. lt'd be like
punishing the people.

798
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:22,812
lf we can set up this
vizontele tomorrow...

799
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:25,619
...he'll get what he deserves.

800
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:29,569
Exactly! Who needs moviehouses
if we have vizontele!

801
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:34,654
We'll have a ceremony.
Put on something decent.

802
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:38,698
-So, isn't this all right?
-No! Haven't you got a jacket?

803
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:39,969
Not with long sleeves.

804
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:41,529
l'll get you one then.

805
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:43,975
No, thanks teacher.
l'll get one myself.

806
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:57,818
What's up Yasar?

807
01:02:58,380 --> 01:02:59,130
Nothing.

808
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:03,334
How can nothing be up?
ls there such a thing as nothing?

809
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:05,329
ls Fikri around?

810
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:06,131
Nope.

811
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:09,815
Fine. l saw him
on my way here anyway.

812
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:14,456
We had a misunderstanding the
other day, but he's not so bad.

813
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:17,580
When you said ''nothing''
you reminded me of something.

814
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:18,530
What's that?

815
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:20,616
Do you know the tale of the
vizier and the elephant?

816
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:21,530
Yes.

817
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:24,411
-The vizier and the ant?
-Yes.

818
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:26,898
Just the vizier?

819
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:30,498
You couldn't have heard it,
l just learned it.

820
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:34,369
l'll tell you about it.
One day the vizier...

821
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:39,973
So, how are
the great revolutionaries?

822
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:41,932
Fine Emin. How about you?

823
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:44,893
You still haven't saved us.

824
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:46,937
Even we couldn't save you.

825
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:50,132
Come see the vizontele! We're
having an opening ceremony soon.

826
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:51,534
lf you're in charge...

827
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:52,889
Where'd you get this suit?

828
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:55,369
A friend gave it to me.

829
01:03:57,100 --> 01:04:00,376
On the brink of war and look
what they're busy with.

830
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:11,099
Which son of a bitch did this?

831
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:15,696
Dad, they torn down the wall
and smashed the bricks.

832
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:22,493
lf they's just left us the bricks,
we could have rebuild the wall.

833
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,135
l'm just explaining
about the bricks.

834
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:29,378
What's up, snow man?

835
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:32,699
Nice suit. Going to a wedding?

836
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:36,369
We're testing the vizontele today
up on that hill.

837
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:39,857
Why spend money on something
that's just going to melt away.

838
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:50,379
Can l help you?

839
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:54,128
Mother, talk to me!

840
01:04:54,220 --> 01:04:55,539
About what?

841
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:58,612
lt was an accident.
All this over a picture?

842
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:01,291
But it's my only picture.

843
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:05,734
Mom, l talked to dad.

844
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:06,970
What about?

845
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:09,375
l've got good news for you.
He'll take you to the photographer!

846
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:12,410
Hurry and get ready.

847
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:13,649
So, how did it happen?

848
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:16,977
l told him how important
it was for you.

849
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:18,249
And he went along with it?

850
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:21,895
Well, l told him there were some
new watches at the studio...

851
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:25,933
...and that he could put one on
for the picture. He liked that.

852
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:28,620
l'll get dressed.
Hang these on the line.

853
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:32,051
l'm going to this vizontele thing.

854
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:35,811
Tell us when you're going to come.

855
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:44,291
Rifat, are you well? Do you
have enough money?

856
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:47,692
Do you have money?

857
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:57,891
Nafiz, l wonder if you could, well,
take me to the vizontele thing.

858
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:03,333
l miss you so much Rifat.

859
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:04,939
Sure, of course we'll go.

860
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:09,853
Rifat, don't hang up!

861
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,374
Let's go.

862
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:14,695
-What about the telephone?
-Come with me.

863
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:34,258
lt's me, Asiye.

864
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:39,658
We're fine.

865
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:44,373
My parents are fine too.

866
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:48,137
How are you?

867
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:56,012
Yes, me too.

868
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:04,378
What? Where is that? Where?

869
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:19,059
So you think Nazmi did it?

870
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:21,216
Did it or had it done.

871
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:23,491
lt must be Siti. lt's just like her!

872
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:25,855
What's the poor woman got
to do with it?

873
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:27,459
Why do you say that?

874
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:28,529
What did l say?

875
01:07:28,620 --> 01:07:30,338
That ''poor'' woman.

876
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:33,730
We're all grandparents now, and
you're still jealous of your sister!

877
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:35,612
She's no sister of mine!

878
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:41,258
My own sister asked at my wedding
whose wedding it was!

879
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:44,976
Made it seem like
you wanted her.

880
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:50,696
Thirty years later
you're still going on about it!

881
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:55,416
You loved her too. That's why
you call her ''poor'' woman now.

882
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:58,134
Go find something better
to do with yourself.

883
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:01,498
lt still bothers you, doesn't it?

884
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:03,178
Enough!

885
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:07,970
Let's go see how the
vizontele thing turns out.

886
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:11,499
Dad, what about that matter?

887
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:13,810
You still haven't
aranged things for the boy.

888
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:18,338
l will in good time!

889
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:21,175
Levelled my wall, did they?

890
01:08:31,169 --> 01:08:33,558
Testing... testing...

891
01:08:35,489 --> 01:08:37,878
What are the good citizens up to?

892
01:08:39,209 --> 01:08:40,403
Get a load of the suit...

893
01:08:40,529 --> 01:08:41,484
Emin!

894
01:08:41,929 --> 01:08:45,319
-What's the matter, Mr. Goldilocks?
-Give the mike to our Mayor.

895
01:08:49,129 --> 01:08:57,002
Dear citizens. We are gathered here
today for a most historical event.

896
01:08:58,409 --> 01:09:02,288
Someone asked
what was historical about it.

897
01:09:03,929 --> 01:09:05,078
l'll tell you.

898
01:09:06,769 --> 01:09:10,159
Visitors always ask us:

899
01:09:11,009 --> 01:09:15,799
How can you live in a place like this?

900
01:09:16,809 --> 01:09:18,879
That's a tough question.

901
01:09:20,129 --> 01:09:25,681
We have no choice but to love
our homeland...

902
01:09:27,049 --> 01:09:34,285
...and there's no other way
to find true happiness.

903
01:09:35,929 --> 01:09:39,968
lf you love this town it becomes
the most beautiful spot in the world.

904
01:09:41,369 --> 01:09:45,328
lf you don't love the most beautiful
spot in the world...

905
01:09:45,449 --> 01:09:48,088
...it is no longer beautiful.

906
01:09:49,889 --> 01:09:52,801
Newspapers arrive here
two days late.

907
01:09:53,729 --> 01:10:00,726
By the time we hear something
city folk have all forgotten about it.

908
01:10:03,009 --> 01:10:05,762
Vizontele will end all that.

909
01:10:06,729 --> 01:10:11,678
We'll see whatever they see
in lstanbul. And at the same time.

910
01:10:11,809 --> 01:10:15,006
Vizontele will narrow the gap
between our town and the world.

911
01:10:15,849 --> 01:10:20,400
Everything will be closer.

912
01:10:21,849 --> 01:10:24,283
May it be to the best for us all.

913
01:10:42,489 --> 01:10:44,002
We're ready, teacher.

914
01:10:44,889 --> 01:10:46,402
ln the name of God...

915
01:11:16,249 --> 01:11:19,958
Look, it's a movie
about a blizzard.

916
01:11:23,289 --> 01:11:24,517
Emin?

917
01:11:27,009 --> 01:11:30,046
Looks like we'll be climbing
another hill.

918
01:11:39,769 --> 01:11:42,442
May it bring joy to our town.

919
01:12:01,609 --> 01:12:03,804
Still snowing away.

920
01:12:06,969 --> 01:12:10,166
lt was so popular
they made a sequel.

921
01:12:35,089 --> 01:12:37,728
l think you can skip the speech
today. l mean, no one...

922
01:12:37,809 --> 01:12:38,764
Turn it on.

923
01:12:38,849 --> 01:12:39,804
Yes, sir.

924
01:12:50,009 --> 01:12:55,720
Save the vizontele. lt's on fire...

925
01:13:15,889 --> 01:13:19,802
lf only you'd seen it.
Up in flames, smoke pouring out.

926
01:13:19,929 --> 01:13:23,080
The Mayor's a relative of mine.
Now they're ribbing me too.

927
01:13:23,329 --> 01:13:26,002
They call him ''The Vizontele Mayor''.

928
01:13:26,129 --> 01:13:28,245
Has a nice ring to it.

929
01:13:29,529 --> 01:13:32,043
Get me some hot water, would you?

930
01:13:32,489 --> 01:13:38,837
l told him it would never work,
but he wouldn't listen.

931
01:13:38,969 --> 01:13:42,245
And l told him we should get a
technician from Ankara.

932
01:13:42,569 --> 01:13:46,403
He and Crazy Emin set the
state's vizontele on fire.

933
01:13:46,689 --> 01:13:48,919
How can l explain this
to the governor?

934
01:13:49,089 --> 01:13:55,722
We'll probably see some real
fiery shows on that thing.

935
01:13:59,569 --> 01:14:02,606
You'll all vote for him again anyway.

936
01:14:03,009 --> 01:14:04,328
Not a chance.

937
01:14:04,609 --> 01:14:07,203
And two people
were wounded they say.

938
01:14:08,889 --> 01:14:12,404
So what are the two cleanest bears
in town talking about?

939
01:14:12,569 --> 01:14:14,560
The vizontele fire.

940
01:14:15,529 --> 01:14:23,083
lt'll go on burning. l'm a movie man,
myself. lt's something else.

941
01:14:24,289 --> 01:14:27,247
Now, who was that tall actor?

942
01:14:27,609 --> 01:14:28,758
Tark Akan.

943
01:14:28,889 --> 01:14:33,007
That's right. He's not that tall.
Just comes up to here.

944
01:14:33,249 --> 01:14:37,401
l saw him in lstanbul once.
That's movies for you.

945
01:14:37,849 --> 01:14:43,958
There's one more thing.
l was walking in Beyolu... last year.

946
01:14:44,169 --> 01:14:45,761
Who was that guy
with the pencil line mustache.

947
01:14:46,009 --> 01:14:47,158
Ayhan lsk.

948
01:14:47,609 --> 01:14:51,204
Of course you know nothing
about Beyolu.

949
01:14:54,769 --> 01:14:58,159
Who was the guy in ''Tourist Omer''?
-Sadri Alsk.

950
01:14:59,129 --> 01:15:01,085
Right. He's got a thin mustache too.

951
01:15:02,089 --> 01:15:05,923
Anyway, l yelled out ''Tourist Omer''
when l saw Ayhan lsk.

952
01:15:06,049 --> 01:15:08,165
He didn't even turn around.

953
01:15:10,769 --> 01:15:14,444
So if you shout out ''Ayhan lsk''
when you see Sadri Alsk...

954
01:15:14,609 --> 01:15:17,567
...probably won't look back either.

955
01:15:17,689 --> 01:15:20,123
That's the weird thing about movies.

956
01:15:22,409 --> 01:15:23,637
-How are you Necati?
-Fine.

957
01:16:07,569 --> 01:16:08,763
Good evening.

958
01:16:09,289 --> 01:16:10,802
Welcome, Veli. How are you my son?

959
01:16:10,969 --> 01:16:12,084
What the hell do you want?

960
01:16:12,329 --> 01:16:13,284
Dad sent me.

961
01:16:13,409 --> 01:16:17,197
He says you have to buy tickets
to watch the movie from the roof.

962
01:16:18,049 --> 01:16:24,079
No more free loaders, he says.

963
01:16:24,609 --> 01:16:25,280
Veli!

964
01:16:25,489 --> 01:16:27,639
They're my dad's orders.

965
01:16:28,289 --> 01:16:31,361
Get the hell out of here.
No money for you!

966
01:16:33,649 --> 01:16:41,408
Well, l'll tell him that's what you
said, then. Good evening.

967
01:16:42,929 --> 01:16:43,805
What does he want?

968
01:16:44,009 --> 01:16:45,203
He came here to sell tickets.

969
01:16:45,609 --> 01:16:46,678
Oh, really

970
01:16:50,609 --> 01:16:53,726
You want money?
Come and get it...

971
01:16:55,889 --> 01:16:56,560
Emin.

972
01:17:00,369 --> 01:17:02,200
Don't even try it.

973
01:17:18,409 --> 01:17:20,525
Just keep on watching.

974
01:17:26,449 --> 01:17:30,283
l cooked stuffed vegetables
in case you were hungry.

975
01:17:30,409 --> 01:17:31,728
At this hour?

976
01:17:31,929 --> 01:17:34,204
Food's good at any time, darling.

977
01:17:35,289 --> 01:17:41,364
l thought it might be my fault
that you want a second wife.

978
01:17:41,609 --> 01:17:43,486
Your fault? Why?

979
01:17:43,809 --> 01:17:48,724
l've let myself go. l've been wearing
the same bra for two years.

980
01:17:50,009 --> 01:17:52,000
l got a new one today.

981
01:17:52,889 --> 01:17:54,686
Wanna see it?

982
01:17:55,089 --> 01:17:56,488
Your bra? Here?

983
01:17:57,209 --> 01:17:59,643
Yes, it's here.

984
01:18:00,089 --> 01:18:03,320
l mean, you wanna show it
to me here...

985
01:18:06,609 --> 01:18:08,725
What are you rascals up to?

986
01:18:12,089 --> 01:18:15,604
Shame on you! Go on home!

987
01:18:45,009 --> 01:18:47,045
Teacher! Come here for a second!

988
01:18:48,809 --> 01:18:49,878
What is it?

989
01:18:50,009 --> 01:18:53,558
The fire started because
this overheated.

990
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:54,798
But Emin's got the answer.

991
01:18:54,889 --> 01:18:56,800
-What?
-Watch this...

992
01:18:59,409 --> 01:19:03,084
This fan will keep it cool.

993
01:19:05,249 --> 01:19:10,642
But we need a battery for the fan.

994
01:19:10,769 --> 01:19:12,487
Where can we get one right away?

995
01:19:12,609 --> 01:19:13,962
Turn it off.

996
01:19:16,529 --> 01:19:17,245
What's wrong?

997
01:19:17,329 --> 01:19:18,842
lt's all over.

998
01:19:19,849 --> 01:19:20,759
What do you mean?

999
01:19:20,889 --> 01:19:24,564
l've made a fool of myself. They're
calling me ''The Vizontele Mayor''.

1000
01:19:24,929 --> 01:19:28,604
Let's get a technician from Ankara.

1001
01:19:29,089 --> 01:19:32,798
We can't quit now.
We'll show them all.

1002
01:19:32,929 --> 01:19:36,080
Especially Latif.
l know what to do.

1003
01:19:36,249 --> 01:19:36,886
What?

1004
01:19:37,129 --> 01:19:39,927
They said to put it high up
on a hill.

1005
01:19:40,089 --> 01:19:42,683
We've been up on
every hilltop around.

1006
01:19:42,809 --> 01:19:46,085
And it didn't work.
So we have to go higher.

1007
01:19:46,169 --> 01:19:47,158
Higher?

1008
01:19:47,289 --> 01:19:48,927
The highest hill of all!

1009
01:19:49,489 --> 01:19:51,161
The highest of all.

1010
01:19:59,969 --> 01:20:01,527
Are you out of your mind?

1011
01:20:01,809 --> 01:20:03,879
All we need is a battery.

1012
01:20:04,009 --> 01:20:08,525
Look, l haven't gone crazy yet. No
one's ever been up there! Forget it.

1013
01:20:08,929 --> 01:20:11,238
l'm sending the vizontele
to Ankara.

1014
01:20:22,809 --> 01:20:25,642
We're leaving this with you.
Take care of it!

1015
01:20:26,609 --> 01:20:28,725
Father, are you going up
Mount Artos?

1016
01:20:29,649 --> 01:20:31,321
Got a problem with that?

1017
01:20:32,409 --> 01:20:36,288
Mayor, have you lost your mind? How
can you go up there at your age?

1018
01:20:37,329 --> 01:20:38,762
Get down here!

1019
01:20:39,169 --> 01:20:40,648
For God's sake, father!

1020
01:20:41,329 --> 01:20:42,557
Shut up!

1021
01:20:42,929 --> 01:20:45,807
Mr. Mayor, l really must
tell you that you're too old.

1022
01:20:46,009 --> 01:20:47,806
And you're not.

1023
01:20:47,969 --> 01:20:48,879
What do you mean, sir?

1024
01:20:48,969 --> 01:20:50,322
Hop in. You're coming along.

1025
01:20:50,409 --> 01:20:52,001
l'm coming too?

1026
01:20:52,329 --> 01:20:54,320
Get in, Goldilocks.

1027
01:20:55,289 --> 01:20:56,642
Stop it!

1028
01:21:06,129 --> 01:21:09,041
May God give you wisdom!
What else can l say?

1029
01:21:15,889 --> 01:21:19,564
Going up Mount Artos.
He's really losing it.

1030
01:21:20,009 --> 01:21:22,045
What about that matter, dad?

1031
01:21:22,169 --> 01:21:24,125
Don't start with me.
l said l'd handle it!

1032
01:21:24,289 --> 01:21:26,120
You keep saying that, but...

1033
01:21:26,249 --> 01:21:29,685
You didn't sell even one ticket.
Get in and get to work!

1034
01:21:33,009 --> 01:21:39,357
The poor guy's lost his mind.
He's not fit to serve his mayor.

1035
01:21:43,089 --> 01:21:44,761
What's going on?

1036
01:21:47,489 --> 01:21:49,047
The car doesn't work.

1037
01:21:55,489 --> 01:21:56,842
Dad, the battery is gone.

1038
01:21:57,569 --> 01:22:01,482
You must have left
the headlights on.

1039
01:22:02,009 --> 01:22:04,523
lt's really gone, dad!
lt's been stolen!

1040
01:22:05,689 --> 01:22:11,366
Someone opened up the hood and
stole it. lf they'd left the battery...

1041
01:22:12,409 --> 01:22:13,478
What'd he say?

1042
01:22:13,769 --> 01:22:17,239
Crazy Emin told me you said
he could pick out any suit...

1043
01:22:17,329 --> 01:22:20,719
...as payment for a radio.

1044
01:22:23,929 --> 01:22:24,725
As payment...

1045
01:22:25,289 --> 01:22:26,039
That's right.

1046
01:22:26,649 --> 01:22:28,560
-And you fell for it...?
-Yes.

1047
01:22:29,729 --> 01:22:31,048
Want some tea?

1048
01:22:31,809 --> 01:22:34,721
l'll get it to you. Go inside.

1049
01:22:39,649 --> 01:22:42,004
Stupid son of a bitch.

1050
01:22:42,729 --> 01:22:50,727
Keep your eyes glued to the
vizontele, Semsi! Got that?

1051
01:22:50,929 --> 01:22:54,558
lf anything happens
let us know. Got it?

1052
01:22:57,689 --> 01:22:59,247
Where did you get the battery?

1053
01:22:59,329 --> 01:23:01,923
Never mind.
A friend gave it to me.

1054
01:23:02,049 --> 01:23:03,198
Mr. Mayor...

1055
01:23:03,409 --> 01:23:07,721
Don't say a word. This is a matter
of honor for me.

1056
01:23:07,929 --> 01:23:12,241
l'll go all the way to the Himalayas
if l have to.

1057
01:23:12,489 --> 01:23:14,844
What can l say?
May God be with you.

1058
01:23:15,049 --> 01:23:18,724
Once we get a picture,
we'll celebrate with a bonfire.

1059
01:23:19,049 --> 01:23:19,845
Yes, sir.

1060
01:23:24,089 --> 01:23:27,047
The mayor's gone bonkers.
He's going up the mountain.

1061
01:23:27,209 --> 01:23:30,599
Emin, you maniac! l'll be seeing you
about the suit.

1062
01:23:30,729 --> 01:23:34,244
Actually, it does need some
alterations.

1063
01:24:45,329 --> 01:24:48,844
We'll walk the rest of the way.

1064
01:25:40,569 --> 01:25:44,084
People keep talking
about my father...

1065
01:25:46,129 --> 01:25:48,927
...saying that he was some kind
of holy man,...

1066
01:25:49,169 --> 01:25:52,241
...that that makes me
a holy man too.

1067
01:25:53,689 --> 01:25:56,761
Half of them think l'm crazy; half
think l'm some kind of a mystic.

1068
01:25:56,889 --> 01:25:58,322
Are they the same?

1069
01:25:58,889 --> 01:26:02,325
l know the real story.
He came here as a soldier...

1070
01:26:02,609 --> 01:26:07,399
...and managed to convince everyone,
including my mother...

1071
01:26:07,529 --> 01:26:10,760
...that he had special healing powers.
That's how l was born.

1072
01:26:10,889 --> 01:26:14,199
A bit of mystical, heavy breathing
and then off he went.

1073
01:26:15,089 --> 01:26:16,727
Being a bastard is not so bad.

1074
01:26:16,889 --> 01:26:18,880
Think of all the hassles l'd have
if l had relatives.

1075
01:26:18,969 --> 01:26:22,245
lf l had a brother he would
only mean trouble.

1076
01:26:22,809 --> 01:26:24,720
You've a point there.

1077
01:26:25,329 --> 01:26:28,958
lsn't it time to find
you a girl, Emin?

1078
01:26:29,209 --> 01:26:31,564
No, thanks. l've got a sweetheart.

1079
01:26:31,929 --> 01:26:33,282
Who?

1080
01:26:33,929 --> 01:26:35,362
She's in Denmark.

1081
01:26:36,129 --> 01:26:38,518
-Where?
-lt's a foreign country.

1082
01:26:39,529 --> 01:26:41,838
-What's she doing over there?
-She's from there.

1083
01:26:42,729 --> 01:26:44,924
How'd did you meet this girl?

1084
01:26:45,049 --> 01:26:47,802
She came here as a tourist,
l showed her around.

1085
01:26:47,929 --> 01:26:52,366
She wanted me to go to Denmark
with her. l asked her...

1086
01:26:52,529 --> 01:26:54,759
...who would look after
my birds?

1087
01:26:54,929 --> 01:26:57,363
You stayed here for your birds?

1088
01:26:58,329 --> 01:27:01,958
They'll die if l go. But when she
insisted, l said...

1089
01:27:02,129 --> 01:27:05,121
...l'd try to sort something out...

1090
01:27:05,249 --> 01:27:07,683
...so l could go see her
next summer...

1091
01:27:08,529 --> 01:27:13,364
We had no idea you were
working on international relations.

1092
01:27:14,329 --> 01:27:19,244
l was just showing her around.
Nothing special.

1093
01:27:19,369 --> 01:27:23,965
We were eating walnuts.
She loved me, and l loved her.

1094
01:27:25,009 --> 01:27:25,998
When did all this happen?

1095
01:27:26,129 --> 01:27:27,562
While we were eating walnuts.

1096
01:27:28,049 --> 01:27:33,601
lt's not my fault.
l just did what she did.

1097
01:28:12,849 --> 01:28:14,282
What are you doing?

1098
01:28:14,809 --> 01:28:17,642
No Cristine, no.

1099
01:28:28,009 --> 01:28:29,601
When did she come here?

1100
01:28:29,729 --> 01:28:30,923
5 years ago.

1101
01:28:32,769 --> 01:28:33,758
What's her name?

1102
01:28:34,089 --> 01:28:36,967
Cristine. Spelled with a 'c'.

1103
01:28:38,369 --> 01:28:42,282
l hope it all works out.
Let's go before it get's too late.

1104
01:28:45,529 --> 01:28:47,360
What are you staring at?
lt's turned off.

1105
01:28:47,689 --> 01:28:50,283
Get lost! lt's the mayor's orders.

1106
01:29:19,289 --> 01:29:21,484
Your hair's thickening with
each mile, Sezgin.

1107
01:29:22,169 --> 01:29:25,047
That inimitable sense
of humor, Mr. Mayor...

1108
01:29:27,169 --> 01:29:28,887
Dammit!

1109
01:29:29,689 --> 01:29:34,843
Gone. You'll have to ask me
about your hair. Yes, it's thinning.

1110
01:29:35,489 --> 01:29:36,558
Shut up.

1111
01:29:37,009 --> 01:29:38,681
Get a move on, Goldilocks.

1112
01:30:18,489 --> 01:30:19,763
Are you ready, Emin?
lt's nightfall.

1113
01:30:19,889 --> 01:30:21,447
Ready, teacher.

1114
01:30:21,609 --> 01:30:25,363
Help us God. This is our last chance.

1115
01:30:37,449 --> 01:30:41,442
Look! A picture!

1116
01:30:58,289 --> 01:31:00,200
Just a minute.

1117
01:31:07,049 --> 01:31:08,801
What's this?

1118
01:31:09,369 --> 01:31:10,199
Persian.

1119
01:31:12,609 --> 01:31:14,008
Why?

1120
01:31:14,449 --> 01:31:21,048
l think it's lranian vizontele.
They must have one too.

1121
01:31:21,369 --> 01:31:22,597
Fuck!

1122
01:31:23,769 --> 01:31:25,566
Excuse me, Mr. Mayor.

1123
01:31:25,809 --> 01:31:29,279
You took the word right
out of my mouth. Fuck!

1124
01:31:35,889 --> 01:31:40,565
Well, Emin? Wasn't it supposed
to work on the highest spot?

1125
01:31:41,489 --> 01:31:44,003
l'm not sure.
Maybe if we go to...

1126
01:31:44,129 --> 01:31:46,438
Stop it Emin, for God's sake!

1127
01:31:46,569 --> 01:31:50,448
That's right, Emin.
lt's your fault we're here.

1128
01:31:50,729 --> 01:31:55,166
Shut up, Goldilocks. Or l'll send you
back for the mirror.

1129
01:31:56,489 --> 01:31:57,763
l'm sorry, teacher.

1130
01:32:02,289 --> 01:32:03,927
What's going on?

1131
01:32:04,609 --> 01:32:06,839
ls it a wedding or something?

1132
01:32:07,089 --> 01:32:09,319
Put out the fire!
People will think that...

1133
01:32:09,489 --> 01:32:13,448
Let it burn...
Otherwise we'll freeze to death.

1134
01:32:42,369 --> 01:32:44,007
What happened?

1135
01:32:44,929 --> 01:32:46,078
We got lranian vizontele.

1136
01:32:46,329 --> 01:32:48,923
-But you built a fire!
-We were cold.

1137
01:33:17,889 --> 01:33:21,165
A Traditional Black Sea Wedding...

1138
01:33:21,489 --> 01:33:24,640
Mr. Mayor! lt's on!

1139
01:33:28,169 --> 01:33:30,842
Turkish vizontele is on!

1140
01:33:43,889 --> 01:33:45,720
Look mom, it's on!

1141
01:34:46,449 --> 01:34:49,486
Welcome, please come in...

1142
01:34:50,409 --> 01:34:51,478
May it be for the best, Mr. Mayor.

1143
01:34:51,609 --> 01:34:53,247
Thank you.

1144
01:35:03,889 --> 01:35:05,208
There's no business tonight, dad.

1145
01:35:05,409 --> 01:35:06,888
They've all gone
to watch the vizontele.

1146
01:35:06,969 --> 01:35:13,488
Don't worry. They'll be back in a
couple of days. lt's the novelty of it.

1147
01:35:26,449 --> 01:35:27,882
Turn it on, Mayor.

1148
01:35:28,369 --> 01:35:32,044
Right. Here, by the grace of God...

1149
01:35:33,609 --> 01:35:35,088
Turn it on, Emin.

1150
01:35:42,729 --> 01:35:43,559
Good evening.

1151
01:35:43,689 --> 01:35:44,565
Good evening.

1152
01:35:48,009 --> 01:35:53,129
The Turkish Armed Forces' naval
and air intervention in Cyprus...

1153
01:35:53,289 --> 01:35:54,881
...continues with
overwhelming success.

1154
01:35:55,049 --> 01:35:58,564
Prime Minister Blent Ecevit
addressed the nation...

1155
01:35:58,689 --> 01:36:01,806
...at a press conference
this morning:

1156
01:36:02,929 --> 01:36:07,605
''We are in Cyprus
to promote peace,...

1157
01:36:07,689 --> 01:36:10,647
...not to forment war.

1158
01:36:10,769 --> 01:36:13,647
We hope that our forces will not
encounter resistance...

1159
01:36:13,769 --> 01:36:15,487
...that will only lead to bloodshed.

1160
01:36:16,609 --> 01:36:20,124
We are there for peace,
not for war.

1161
01:36:20,249 --> 01:36:25,198
We're also there
to bring peace to the Greeks.''

1162
01:36:25,609 --> 01:36:30,637
The marine corps are successfully
holding Girne, at great cost...

1163
01:36:30,729 --> 01:36:35,519
...to enemy ranks. Turkish forces
have suffered 5 fatalities...

1164
01:36:35,689 --> 01:36:38,567
2 officers and 3 privates.
Lost in action are...

1165
01:39:19,249 --> 01:39:20,238
Where is he?

1166
01:39:20,369 --> 01:39:21,245
Who?

1167
01:39:21,409 --> 01:39:23,286
My son, where is he?

1168
01:39:23,489 --> 01:39:27,767
The general called today. He told us
to be proud of our boy,...

1169
01:39:27,889 --> 01:39:33,247
...said he was a true hero.
They built him a tomb...

1170
01:39:33,409 --> 01:39:37,322
...at the War Martyrs' Cemetery
in Cyprus.

1171
01:39:41,529 --> 01:39:43,679
He said it. One of the top brass.
Would he call just anyone?

1172
01:39:43,849 --> 01:39:47,444
-Our boy must have been great.
-Teacher, Mother Siti says to...

1173
01:39:53,409 --> 01:39:58,688
Don't do it ma'am.
lt's not the gadget's fault...

1174
01:40:24,449 --> 01:40:26,246
Grandfather...

1175
01:40:30,449 --> 01:40:31,962
Father.

1176
01:40:34,049 --> 01:40:38,565
We're going to my father's house.

1177
01:41:14,369 --> 01:41:15,768
Where is everybody?

1178
01:41:16,089 --> 01:41:20,162
The Brazil match is on TV.
They'll come after the game.

1179
01:41:35,889 --> 01:41:38,801
Shall l put the head facing that way?

1180
01:41:54,849 --> 01:42:00,446
And a brand new Phillips television
from the groom's uncle.

1181
01:42:00,529 --> 01:42:04,602
Everyone clap!
Upon your feet, everyone!

1182
01:45:33,769 --> 01:45:36,078
Turn the antenna some more.

1183
01:45:36,529 --> 01:45:37,279
Like this?

1184
01:45:37,369 --> 01:45:38,848
Some more.

1185
01:45:41,809 --> 01:45:43,083
ls it on?

1186
01:45:44,209 --> 01:45:45,119
ls it?

1187
01:45:45,209 --> 01:45:47,404
Yes, we've got it.
